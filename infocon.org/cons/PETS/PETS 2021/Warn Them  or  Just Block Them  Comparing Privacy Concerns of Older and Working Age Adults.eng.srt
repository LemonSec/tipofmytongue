00:00:00,480 --> 00:00:02,639
hello everyone welcome to our

2
00:00:02,639 --> 00:00:03,600
presentation

3
00:00:03,600 --> 00:00:06,480
on our paper titled warm them or just

4
00:00:06,480 --> 00:00:07,600
block them

5
00:00:07,600 --> 00:00:10,719
comparing the privacy concerns of older

6
00:00:10,719 --> 00:00:14,080
and working age adults

7
00:00:14,160 --> 00:00:16,800
this study was motivated by certain gaps

8
00:00:16,800 --> 00:00:18,080
in literature

9
00:00:18,080 --> 00:00:21,439
we found that prior work has yet to

10
00:00:21,439 --> 00:00:23,039
extensively explore

11
00:00:23,039 --> 00:00:25,680
the usable privacy perceptions of older

12
00:00:25,680 --> 00:00:28,000
adults

13
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:31,599
gang idol reported that older adults are

14
00:00:31,599 --> 00:00:33,920
known to be less informed of privacy

15
00:00:33,920 --> 00:00:34,960
violations

16
00:00:34,960 --> 00:00:37,200
that they may perform as well as

17
00:00:37,200 --> 00:00:40,239
protective measures that they can take

18
00:00:40,239 --> 00:00:42,719
um there has also been generally less

19
00:00:42,719 --> 00:00:43,440
focus

20
00:00:43,440 --> 00:00:46,559
on the direct comparisons between older

21
00:00:46,559 --> 00:00:47,360
adults

22
00:00:47,360 --> 00:00:50,719
and their younger counterparts

23
00:00:50,719 --> 00:00:53,600
keeping this in mind our research aims

24
00:00:53,600 --> 00:00:56,320
to address the following questions

25
00:00:56,320 --> 00:00:58,399
what are the mental models and the

26
00:00:58,399 --> 00:00:59,840
perceptions of privacy

27
00:00:59,840 --> 00:01:03,520
among older adults what are the mental

28
00:01:03,520 --> 00:01:04,080
models

29
00:01:04,080 --> 00:01:06,479
and perceptions of privacy among working

30
00:01:06,479 --> 00:01:08,080
age adults

31
00:01:08,080 --> 00:01:10,080
and what are the overlaps and

32
00:01:10,080 --> 00:01:11,280
differences

33
00:01:11,280 --> 00:01:13,119
in the mental models and privacy

34
00:01:13,119 --> 00:01:14,880
perceptions between both

35
00:01:14,880 --> 00:01:18,240
these age groups now we consider

36
00:01:18,240 --> 00:01:22,000
mental models to be the explanation of

37
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:24,479
someone's thought process about what

38
00:01:24,479 --> 00:01:25,439
something is

39
00:01:25,439 --> 00:01:28,640
or how something works

40
00:01:28,640 --> 00:01:31,600
now um oats at all conducted a great

41
00:01:31,600 --> 00:01:32,320
study

42
00:01:32,320 --> 00:01:35,280
to understand the mental models and

43
00:01:35,280 --> 00:01:36,799
privacy perceptions

44
00:01:36,799 --> 00:01:40,400
of individuals using a quite a novel

45
00:01:40,400 --> 00:01:43,920
qualitative approach they incorporated

46
00:01:43,920 --> 00:01:46,640
picture drawing sessions um and they

47
00:01:46,640 --> 00:01:48,159
asked participants

48
00:01:48,159 --> 00:01:51,280
to draw what privacy means to them

49
00:01:51,280 --> 00:01:54,399
it's really quite an interesting paper

50
00:01:54,399 --> 00:01:58,560
we replicated elements of their study

51
00:01:58,560 --> 00:02:02,399
into our study with older adults

52
00:02:02,399 --> 00:02:05,200
well to be more specific we split our

53
00:02:05,200 --> 00:02:07,520
study into two parts

54
00:02:07,520 --> 00:02:10,239
for study one we conducted some

55
00:02:10,239 --> 00:02:12,000
semi-structured interviews

56
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:15,120
with 20 older adults we provided

57
00:02:15,120 --> 00:02:17,440
participants with a sheet of paper

58
00:02:17,440 --> 00:02:20,239
and we asked them what does privacy mean

59
00:02:20,239 --> 00:02:21,360
to you

60
00:02:21,360 --> 00:02:25,680
in both digital and non-digital contacts

61
00:02:25,680 --> 00:02:27,840
um they were then asked to explain their

62
00:02:27,840 --> 00:02:28,959
drawings

63
00:02:28,959 --> 00:02:31,200
and also ask questions about their

64
00:02:31,200 --> 00:02:34,720
perceptions of privacy

65
00:02:34,720 --> 00:02:37,599
a set of 10 images drawn by the older

66
00:02:37,599 --> 00:02:38,400
adults

67
00:02:38,400 --> 00:02:41,040
were then shown to the working age

68
00:02:41,040 --> 00:02:42,800
adults

69
00:02:42,800 --> 00:02:45,360
they were asked whether they related to

70
00:02:45,360 --> 00:02:46,400
any of the

71
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:49,040
privacy perceptions which were being

72
00:02:49,040 --> 00:02:50,160
depict depicted

73
00:02:50,160 --> 00:02:54,160
in those illustrations by older adults

74
00:02:54,160 --> 00:02:55,920
and the working age adults were then

75
00:02:55,920 --> 00:02:57,360
asked a few questions

76
00:02:57,360 --> 00:03:00,400
about their privacy perceptions

77
00:03:00,400 --> 00:03:03,840
followed by optionally drawing their own

78
00:03:03,840 --> 00:03:07,040
depictions of privacy

79
00:03:07,040 --> 00:03:09,040
the illustrations and the interview

80
00:03:09,040 --> 00:03:10,159
responses

81
00:03:10,159 --> 00:03:12,319
from both the age groups were

82
00:03:12,319 --> 00:03:14,159
qualitatively analyzed

83
00:03:14,159 --> 00:03:17,519
and 10 hypotheses were formed

84
00:03:17,519 --> 00:03:20,319
these hypotheses served as a foundation

85
00:03:20,319 --> 00:03:22,640
for study two

86
00:03:22,640 --> 00:03:26,239
now study two involved an online survey

87
00:03:26,239 --> 00:03:29,840
using like questions and pairwise image

88
00:03:29,840 --> 00:03:31,280
comparisons

89
00:03:31,280 --> 00:03:34,720
to determine whether the qualitative

90
00:03:34,720 --> 00:03:35,440
findings

91
00:03:35,440 --> 00:03:38,400
that we got from study one could extend

92
00:03:38,400 --> 00:03:40,319
to a larger sample

93
00:03:40,319 --> 00:03:43,920
of 111 participants

94
00:03:43,920 --> 00:03:44,959
now for the remainder of this

95
00:03:44,959 --> 00:03:47,200
presentation i will go over the details

96
00:03:47,200 --> 00:03:49,360
of study one and study two

97
00:03:49,360 --> 00:03:52,720
um covering some examples of interesting

98
00:03:52,720 --> 00:03:53,200
data

99
00:03:53,200 --> 00:03:55,760
which we collected um i will then

100
00:03:55,760 --> 00:03:57,760
briefly discuss some of the recurring

101
00:03:57,760 --> 00:03:59,519
themes which emerged

102
00:03:59,519 --> 00:04:02,480
as well as some risk scenarios that we

103
00:04:02,480 --> 00:04:04,560
developed

104
00:04:04,560 --> 00:04:06,480
i will then conclude with some final

105
00:04:06,480 --> 00:04:07,599
takeaways

106
00:04:07,599 --> 00:04:11,599
and the implications of our findings

107
00:04:11,599 --> 00:04:14,640
now the term risk scenarios we we use

108
00:04:14,640 --> 00:04:16,320
this term as

109
00:04:16,320 --> 00:04:19,519
a narrative example of sorts

110
00:04:19,519 --> 00:04:22,960
which symbolizes our key findings

111
00:04:22,960 --> 00:04:26,800
i'll show an example of this later on

112
00:04:26,800 --> 00:04:30,320
now our study allowed us to gain a

113
00:04:30,320 --> 00:04:31,759
deeper understanding

114
00:04:31,759 --> 00:04:34,639
of older adults privacy and security

115
00:04:34,639 --> 00:04:36,000
concerns

116
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:39,120
while also identifying the overlaps and

117
00:04:39,120 --> 00:04:40,479
the differences

118
00:04:40,479 --> 00:04:43,680
with a younger demographic

119
00:04:43,680 --> 00:04:46,800
we did this by using surveys to compare

120
00:04:46,800 --> 00:04:49,040
the pairs of illustrations

121
00:04:49,040 --> 00:04:52,160
um from the two age groups we considered

122
00:04:52,160 --> 00:04:54,479
this to be a novel approach

123
00:04:54,479 --> 00:04:57,280
to contrasting usable privacy concerns

124
00:04:57,280 --> 00:04:59,360
between user groups

125
00:04:59,360 --> 00:05:02,479
um and we also offered risk scenarios in

126
00:05:02,479 --> 00:05:03,600
order to

127
00:05:03,600 --> 00:05:06,800
aid the tailoring of applications which

128
00:05:06,800 --> 00:05:07,199
would

129
00:05:07,199 --> 00:05:10,240
ultimately help better accommodate

130
00:05:10,240 --> 00:05:15,440
the privacy concerns of this demographic

131
00:05:15,440 --> 00:05:17,600
i will now go over the two studies

132
00:05:17,600 --> 00:05:19,440
starting with study one

133
00:05:19,440 --> 00:05:22,840
which involved semi-structured

134
00:05:22,840 --> 00:05:24,639
interviews

135
00:05:24,639 --> 00:05:27,680
we recruited 20 older adults

136
00:05:27,680 --> 00:05:31,120
from local state operated senior centers

137
00:05:31,120 --> 00:05:34,479
and 20 working age adults from public

138
00:05:34,479 --> 00:05:35,840
community venues

139
00:05:35,840 --> 00:05:39,840
like libraries and universities

140
00:05:40,160 --> 00:05:43,440
these venues were known to have diverse

141
00:05:43,440 --> 00:05:45,759
socio-economic and educational

142
00:05:45,759 --> 00:05:47,199
backgrounds

143
00:05:47,199 --> 00:05:49,600
and we use recruitment flyers and

144
00:05:49,600 --> 00:05:52,320
mailing lists

145
00:05:52,320 --> 00:05:54,560
the interviews began with the collection

146
00:05:54,560 --> 00:05:57,039
of demographic information

147
00:05:57,039 --> 00:05:59,520
participants were then handed a pencil

148
00:05:59,520 --> 00:06:01,199
and sheets of paper

149
00:06:01,199 --> 00:06:04,080
and they were asked to draw what privacy

150
00:06:04,080 --> 00:06:06,560
meant to them

151
00:06:06,560 --> 00:06:08,479
we asked them follow-up questions after

152
00:06:08,479 --> 00:06:10,080
they were done drawing

153
00:06:10,080 --> 00:06:13,280
to explain their drawings to us and the

154
00:06:13,280 --> 00:06:14,319
researchers

155
00:06:14,319 --> 00:06:17,360
added annotations on the drawings

156
00:06:17,360 --> 00:06:19,520
using a pen of a different color to

157
00:06:19,520 --> 00:06:20,560
explain

158
00:06:20,560 --> 00:06:24,160
help explain the drawing um

159
00:06:24,160 --> 00:06:26,400
after that questions were then asked to

160
00:06:26,400 --> 00:06:28,400
the participants about their

161
00:06:28,400 --> 00:06:31,039
online experiences their confidence in

162
00:06:31,039 --> 00:06:33,039
maintaining their privacy

163
00:06:33,039 --> 00:06:35,280
any past experiences they had with

164
00:06:35,280 --> 00:06:37,199
privacy violations

165
00:06:37,199 --> 00:06:40,800
and how they think other age groups

166
00:06:40,800 --> 00:06:43,919
maintain their privacy for the

167
00:06:43,919 --> 00:06:45,759
interviews with working age adults

168
00:06:45,759 --> 00:06:48,319
they were first shown a set of 10 images

169
00:06:48,319 --> 00:06:50,160
drawn by older adults

170
00:06:50,160 --> 00:06:51,520
and then they were asked whether they

171
00:06:51,520 --> 00:06:54,240
related to each of these images

172
00:06:54,240 --> 00:06:55,599
they were then asked a series of

173
00:06:55,599 --> 00:06:58,479
follow-up questions and then

174
00:06:58,479 --> 00:07:03,360
to draw their own depictions of privacy

175
00:07:03,360 --> 00:07:05,440
now these are some of the illustrations

176
00:07:05,440 --> 00:07:07,440
drawn by our participants which i

177
00:07:07,440 --> 00:07:09,280
thought were quite interesting

178
00:07:09,280 --> 00:07:12,639
um on the left we see an older adult

179
00:07:12,639 --> 00:07:15,840
feeling overwhelmed by privacy threats

180
00:07:15,840 --> 00:07:17,039
and they're saying

181
00:07:17,039 --> 00:07:20,400
ubo is made in the digital privacy sense

182
00:07:20,400 --> 00:07:22,639
and you could see that they feel quite

183
00:07:22,639 --> 00:07:24,479
negatively by the expression that they

184
00:07:24,479 --> 00:07:26,400
have drawn

185
00:07:26,400 --> 00:07:28,800
while on the right we see a working edge

186
00:07:28,800 --> 00:07:29,759
adult

187
00:07:29,759 --> 00:07:32,880
feeling resigned by privacy threats and

188
00:07:32,880 --> 00:07:33,840
saying

189
00:07:33,840 --> 00:07:37,599
i give up so this shows a contrast in

190
00:07:37,599 --> 00:07:38,080
how

191
00:07:38,080 --> 00:07:40,720
each of these age groups reacted to

192
00:07:40,720 --> 00:07:45,199
being faced with privacy

193
00:07:45,199 --> 00:07:46,960
and these are some of the codes from

194
00:07:46,960 --> 00:07:49,039
some of the participants

195
00:07:49,039 --> 00:07:52,560
p3 who was an older adult said

196
00:07:52,560 --> 00:07:54,960
lord knows what they have talking about

197
00:07:54,960 --> 00:07:56,319
personal data held by

198
00:07:56,319 --> 00:07:58,800
third parties and who knows how they got

199
00:07:58,800 --> 00:07:59,599
it

200
00:07:59,599 --> 00:08:02,319
so this showed a lack of understanding

201
00:08:02,319 --> 00:08:03,280
of data storage

202
00:08:03,280 --> 00:08:06,560
online but also a fear of the

203
00:08:06,560 --> 00:08:10,560
vulnerability of their information

204
00:08:11,199 --> 00:08:13,759
e36 who was a working age adult said

205
00:08:13,759 --> 00:08:14,560
that

206
00:08:14,560 --> 00:08:17,520
but they which are the corporations are

207
00:08:17,520 --> 00:08:19,199
not evil

208
00:08:19,199 --> 00:08:22,160
my emotion would be more frustration

209
00:08:22,160 --> 00:08:22,560
than

210
00:08:22,560 --> 00:08:25,599
depression or anger i feel resigned and

211
00:08:25,599 --> 00:08:26,800
i just pretty much

212
00:08:26,800 --> 00:08:29,919
accept it at this point so this sort of

213
00:08:29,919 --> 00:08:31,039
reinforces

214
00:08:31,039 --> 00:08:33,360
the illustration we saw in the previous

215
00:08:33,360 --> 00:08:34,559
slide

216
00:08:34,559 --> 00:08:38,839
a sense of resignation among working age

217
00:08:38,839 --> 00:08:41,120
adults now when asked what

218
00:08:41,120 --> 00:08:44,399
ideal privacy would be to them um

219
00:08:44,399 --> 00:08:47,839
one working hr drew an interesting image

220
00:08:47,839 --> 00:08:49,279
of a castle

221
00:08:49,279 --> 00:08:52,640
but they also said that this is idealish

222
00:08:52,640 --> 00:08:53,760
privacy

223
00:08:53,760 --> 00:08:55,839
even though it's a castle it can be

224
00:08:55,839 --> 00:08:56,880
breached by

225
00:08:56,880 --> 00:09:00,320
a battering ram or a trojan horse

226
00:09:00,320 --> 00:09:03,680
if given the time if the guards are not

227
00:09:03,680 --> 00:09:05,040
paying attention

228
00:09:05,040 --> 00:09:08,560
the ram and the horse can just break in

229
00:09:08,560 --> 00:09:11,760
and then the castle just falls so

230
00:09:11,760 --> 00:09:15,200
it just shows a general skepticism

231
00:09:15,200 --> 00:09:16,800
towards the the concept

232
00:09:16,800 --> 00:09:20,160
of ideal privacy itself and it could

233
00:09:20,160 --> 00:09:21,680
also imply that

234
00:09:21,680 --> 00:09:24,560
the just the abundance of privacy

235
00:09:24,560 --> 00:09:25,120
threats

236
00:09:25,120 --> 00:09:28,560
has already begun to desensitize

237
00:09:28,560 --> 00:09:31,839
some working age arrows

238
00:09:32,240 --> 00:09:34,240
for the analysis of this data that we

239
00:09:34,240 --> 00:09:36,000
saw two researchers

240
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:38,880
performed inductive thematic coding of

241
00:09:38,880 --> 00:09:40,160
the illustrations

242
00:09:40,160 --> 00:09:43,120
and the interview responses findings

243
00:09:43,120 --> 00:09:45,120
from these interviews were framed as

244
00:09:45,120 --> 00:09:48,880
10 hypotheses and these hypotheses

245
00:09:48,880 --> 00:09:50,480
served as a foundation

246
00:09:50,480 --> 00:09:54,000
for the leica questions that were used

247
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:57,440
in an online survey and distributed to a

248
00:09:57,440 --> 00:10:02,959
larger population of 111 participants

249
00:10:03,279 --> 00:10:05,279
pairwise image comparisons were also

250
00:10:05,279 --> 00:10:06,320
included

251
00:10:06,320 --> 00:10:09,600
which consisted of images drawn by each

252
00:10:09,600 --> 00:10:10,480
age group

253
00:10:10,480 --> 00:10:13,600
and they were selected due to

254
00:10:13,600 --> 00:10:15,680
certain contrasting themes that were

255
00:10:15,680 --> 00:10:16,640
found

256
00:10:16,640 --> 00:10:18,800
so an example of which we saw a few

257
00:10:18,800 --> 00:10:19,920
slides ago

258
00:10:19,920 --> 00:10:22,399
with each age group's reaction to

259
00:10:22,399 --> 00:10:23,920
privacy threats

260
00:10:23,920 --> 00:10:26,240
feeling overwhelmed versus feeling

261
00:10:26,240 --> 00:10:27,600
resigned

262
00:10:27,600 --> 00:10:30,320
um the quantitative analysis of the

263
00:10:30,320 --> 00:10:32,000
survey responses

264
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:34,480
then provided a final set of significant

265
00:10:34,480 --> 00:10:36,959
results

266
00:10:37,360 --> 00:10:40,560
now uh as i mentioned we found 10

267
00:10:40,560 --> 00:10:41,519
hypotheses

268
00:10:41,519 --> 00:10:44,800
from study one these are just a subset

269
00:10:44,800 --> 00:10:47,120
of the 10 hypothesis hypothesis we ended

270
00:10:47,120 --> 00:10:49,120
up with

271
00:10:49,120 --> 00:10:51,519
we found that older adults are more

272
00:10:51,519 --> 00:10:52,320
worried about

273
00:10:52,320 --> 00:10:54,640
society's privacy than individual

274
00:10:54,640 --> 00:10:55,839
privacy

275
00:10:55,839 --> 00:10:57,440
they are more concerned about leaking

276
00:10:57,440 --> 00:11:00,079
information through mobile phones than

277
00:11:00,079 --> 00:11:02,000
any other devices

278
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:04,959
they are more frustrated by global

279
00:11:04,959 --> 00:11:05,920
online attacks

280
00:11:05,920 --> 00:11:10,000
as opposed to local scam calls they feel

281
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:13,040
more targeted and victimized by privacy

282
00:11:13,040 --> 00:11:14,399
attacks

283
00:11:14,399 --> 00:11:17,600
and they prefer having power

284
00:11:17,600 --> 00:11:20,800
control and ownership over objects as a

285
00:11:20,800 --> 00:11:24,079
form of ideal privacy

286
00:11:24,720 --> 00:11:26,880
i will now describe study 2 which

287
00:11:26,880 --> 00:11:29,279
involved using online surveys

288
00:11:29,279 --> 00:11:33,279
to extend our qualitative findings

289
00:11:33,279 --> 00:11:36,079
as touched on before leica questions

290
00:11:36,079 --> 00:11:37,040
were developed

291
00:11:37,040 --> 00:11:39,279
based on the hypothesis we found from

292
00:11:39,279 --> 00:11:40,800
study one

293
00:11:40,800 --> 00:11:42,800
and these are some of the examples of

294
00:11:42,800 --> 00:11:44,880
the leica questions that were used in

295
00:11:44,880 --> 00:11:46,240
the survey

296
00:11:46,240 --> 00:11:48,800
so questions such as i give permissions

297
00:11:48,800 --> 00:11:50,160
to most of my apps

298
00:11:50,160 --> 00:11:52,000
on my phone to access my private

299
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:53,279
information

300
00:11:53,279 --> 00:11:55,839
how well does a sentence describe and

301
00:11:55,839 --> 00:11:57,519
then participants were asked

302
00:11:57,519 --> 00:12:01,440
to choose from a five point liker

303
00:12:02,160 --> 00:12:05,120
this is an example of the pairwise image

304
00:12:05,120 --> 00:12:06,079
comparisons

305
00:12:06,079 --> 00:12:08,560
incorporated in our survey the images

306
00:12:08,560 --> 00:12:10,480
were described to the participant as

307
00:12:10,480 --> 00:12:11,360
well

308
00:12:11,360 --> 00:12:14,720
as we see here on the top it says given

309
00:12:14,720 --> 00:12:16,160
below our two images

310
00:12:16,160 --> 00:12:18,320
on the left we see a person who feels

311
00:12:18,320 --> 00:12:20,079
targeted and victimized by privacy

312
00:12:20,079 --> 00:12:20,959
threats

313
00:12:20,959 --> 00:12:22,639
on the right we see a person who has

314
00:12:22,639 --> 00:12:24,399
come to terms with it

315
00:12:24,399 --> 00:12:26,560
and then participants were asked select

316
00:12:26,560 --> 00:12:28,240
either a or b

317
00:12:28,240 --> 00:12:30,480
or neither if they didn't relate to

318
00:12:30,480 --> 00:12:33,120
either image

319
00:12:33,519 --> 00:12:36,000
for analyzing our survey responses we

320
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:36,720
used

321
00:12:36,720 --> 00:12:39,519
man whitney u test for the leica data

322
00:12:39,519 --> 00:12:41,519
fischer's exact test for the pairwise

323
00:12:41,519 --> 00:12:43,040
image comparisons

324
00:12:43,040 --> 00:12:45,519
and home bone prooni corrections were

325
00:12:45,519 --> 00:12:46,240
used

326
00:12:46,240 --> 00:12:47,920
to account for the large number of

327
00:12:47,920 --> 00:12:49,279
hypotheses

328
00:12:49,279 --> 00:12:52,560
that we had um after

329
00:12:52,560 --> 00:12:56,079
the analysis we found that older adults

330
00:12:56,079 --> 00:12:57,440
are more apprehensive

331
00:12:57,440 --> 00:13:00,000
than working age adults about giving

332
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:01,360
their private information

333
00:13:01,360 --> 00:13:04,240
to to strangers even if they had

334
00:13:04,240 --> 00:13:05,360
safeguards

335
00:13:05,360 --> 00:13:08,800
in place to protect them they felt more

336
00:13:08,800 --> 00:13:09,920
frustrated

337
00:13:09,920 --> 00:13:12,800
than working age adults by global online

338
00:13:12,800 --> 00:13:13,440
attacks

339
00:13:13,440 --> 00:13:16,959
as opposed to local scam callers and

340
00:13:16,959 --> 00:13:19,120
they were less concerned than working

341
00:13:19,120 --> 00:13:20,240
age adults

342
00:13:20,240 --> 00:13:22,880
about their private information being

343
00:13:22,880 --> 00:13:24,480
shared online through

344
00:13:24,480 --> 00:13:27,360
social media

345
00:13:28,079 --> 00:13:31,279
our findings showed that older adults

346
00:13:31,279 --> 00:13:35,200
exhibited complex privacy attitudes

347
00:13:35,200 --> 00:13:37,760
they would use certain mitigation

348
00:13:37,760 --> 00:13:38,880
strategies

349
00:13:38,880 --> 00:13:42,079
which would include um visiting the

350
00:13:42,079 --> 00:13:44,959
physical equivalence of online services

351
00:13:44,959 --> 00:13:45,680
like

352
00:13:45,680 --> 00:13:48,240
going to the bank or going to a shopping

353
00:13:48,240 --> 00:13:48,880
mall

354
00:13:48,880 --> 00:13:52,320
instead of using an on mobile banking or

355
00:13:52,320 --> 00:13:54,639
online shopping application

356
00:13:54,639 --> 00:13:57,040
um they thought that visiting the

357
00:13:57,040 --> 00:13:58,720
physical location would be

358
00:13:58,720 --> 00:14:02,720
safer than using the digital alternative

359
00:14:02,720 --> 00:14:05,440
um their acceptance or a version of

360
00:14:05,440 --> 00:14:07,040
using technology

361
00:14:07,040 --> 00:14:10,160
often stemmed from their own personal

362
00:14:10,160 --> 00:14:12,240
experiences in the past

363
00:14:12,240 --> 00:14:15,040
or through stories that were told to

364
00:14:15,040 --> 00:14:15,440
them

365
00:14:15,440 --> 00:14:20,240
from relatives or family or friends

366
00:14:20,800 --> 00:14:22,880
a team of empowerment was also

367
00:14:22,880 --> 00:14:23,920
identified

368
00:14:23,920 --> 00:14:27,360
from our studies where older adults were

369
00:14:27,360 --> 00:14:28,800
helping themselves

370
00:14:28,800 --> 00:14:31,760
to better understand issues relating to

371
00:14:31,760 --> 00:14:34,880
security and privacy

372
00:14:34,880 --> 00:14:37,120
there was a presence of misconceptions

373
00:14:37,120 --> 00:14:39,199
and feelings of uncertainty

374
00:14:39,199 --> 00:14:41,760
during our interviews which highlighted

375
00:14:41,760 --> 00:14:44,320
that education could still go further

376
00:14:44,320 --> 00:14:48,079
to better support older adults

377
00:14:48,079 --> 00:14:50,480
while both age groups in the study

378
00:14:50,480 --> 00:14:53,440
touched upon the subject of social media

379
00:14:53,440 --> 00:14:56,480
the working adult age group highlighted

380
00:14:56,480 --> 00:14:58,160
concerns regarding

381
00:14:58,160 --> 00:15:01,040
how private data can be leaked and

382
00:15:01,040 --> 00:15:03,279
sometimes out of their control

383
00:15:03,279 --> 00:15:05,760
for example they felt that information

384
00:15:05,760 --> 00:15:06,720
may be

385
00:15:06,720 --> 00:15:09,279
inadvertently shared with friends or

386
00:15:09,279 --> 00:15:09,839
friends

387
00:15:09,839 --> 00:15:15,360
on social media or via personal devices

388
00:15:15,360 --> 00:15:17,600
and finally a theme of being resigned to

389
00:15:17,600 --> 00:15:18,399
threats

390
00:15:18,399 --> 00:15:21,600
being faced was also detected among

391
00:15:21,600 --> 00:15:26,240
working age adults

392
00:15:26,240 --> 00:15:29,440
now we offer risk scenarios to better

393
00:15:29,440 --> 00:15:32,000
convey the practical implications of our

394
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:34,240
findings

395
00:15:34,240 --> 00:15:36,000
these are meant to be condensed

396
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:37,360
narrative exemplars

397
00:15:37,360 --> 00:15:39,680
of the core findings that you saw

398
00:15:39,680 --> 00:15:41,120
regarding the primary

399
00:15:41,120 --> 00:15:44,079
privacy concerns of older adults as

400
00:15:44,079 --> 00:15:47,599
compared to working age adults

401
00:15:47,759 --> 00:15:50,399
now just consider the following scenario

402
00:15:50,399 --> 00:15:52,639
for a fictional character

403
00:15:52,639 --> 00:15:56,480
say give her the give them the name mary

404
00:15:56,480 --> 00:15:59,519
mary visited the bank to deposit a check

405
00:15:59,519 --> 00:16:02,800
in her name she was required to

406
00:16:02,800 --> 00:16:05,279
wait in line for approximately an hour

407
00:16:05,279 --> 00:16:06,720
for her turn

408
00:16:06,720 --> 00:16:10,320
while others cut in ahead of her

409
00:16:10,320 --> 00:16:14,000
uh however despite the long waiting time

410
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:14,959
at the bank

411
00:16:14,959 --> 00:16:17,600
and overall poor experience she still

412
00:16:17,600 --> 00:16:19,279
intends to deposit her check

413
00:16:19,279 --> 00:16:21,600
at the bank the next time instead of

414
00:16:21,600 --> 00:16:24,959
using a mobile banking application

415
00:16:24,959 --> 00:16:27,040
now after this happens mary says

416
00:16:27,040 --> 00:16:29,040
something along these lines

417
00:16:29,040 --> 00:16:31,199
i know that using an app on my phone is

418
00:16:31,199 --> 00:16:32,320
probably faster

419
00:16:32,320 --> 00:16:34,800
or maybe even the machine but i don't

420
00:16:34,800 --> 00:16:36,240
know what's happening with my check

421
00:16:36,240 --> 00:16:38,880
when i use these devices at the bank i

422
00:16:38,880 --> 00:16:40,480
can see a person who's physically

423
00:16:40,480 --> 00:16:41,279
present

424
00:16:41,279 --> 00:16:43,600
i can even talk to them and ask them

425
00:16:43,600 --> 00:16:44,480
questions

426
00:16:44,480 --> 00:16:48,800
i just feel safer and at ease this way

427
00:16:48,800 --> 00:16:51,120
so this illustrates mary's concern with

428
00:16:51,120 --> 00:16:52,320
online banking

429
00:16:52,320 --> 00:16:54,160
and discomfort with not knowing what's

430
00:16:54,160 --> 00:16:56,160
happening behind the scenes

431
00:16:56,160 --> 00:16:58,959
uh we find that fear of the unknown is a

432
00:16:58,959 --> 00:17:01,040
powerful detrimental factor

433
00:17:01,040 --> 00:17:03,199
which leads mary to be more comfortable

434
00:17:03,199 --> 00:17:05,439
with tangible transactions

435
00:17:05,439 --> 00:17:08,720
rather than intangible ones

436
00:17:08,720 --> 00:17:10,720
these scenarios could help designers

437
00:17:10,720 --> 00:17:12,000
develop empathy

438
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:14,559
and understand the circumstances older

439
00:17:14,559 --> 00:17:15,359
adults face

440
00:17:15,359 --> 00:17:17,520
while using technology which may be

441
00:17:17,520 --> 00:17:20,160
different from their own

442
00:17:20,160 --> 00:17:22,880
so to briefly sum up we use draw metrics

443
00:17:22,880 --> 00:17:23,919
to assess

444
00:17:23,919 --> 00:17:26,079
older and working age adults mental

445
00:17:26,079 --> 00:17:27,119
models

446
00:17:27,119 --> 00:17:29,440
we use an online survey to extend our

447
00:17:29,440 --> 00:17:30,720
findings

448
00:17:30,720 --> 00:17:33,200
we found that older adults are more

449
00:17:33,200 --> 00:17:34,000
apprehensive

450
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:35,919
than working age adults about giving

451
00:17:35,919 --> 00:17:38,240
their private information to strangers

452
00:17:38,240 --> 00:17:40,160
they feel more frustrated by global

453
00:17:40,160 --> 00:17:42,400
online attacks as opposed to local scam

454
00:17:42,400 --> 00:17:43,440
callers

455
00:17:43,440 --> 00:17:45,200
and they're less concerned about their

456
00:17:45,200 --> 00:17:46,640
private information

457
00:17:46,640 --> 00:17:50,400
being shared online through social media

458
00:17:50,400 --> 00:17:52,880
in the future studies should consider

459
00:17:52,880 --> 00:17:55,280
performing more direct comparisons

460
00:17:55,280 --> 00:17:57,760
rather than focusing older adults in

461
00:17:57,760 --> 00:17:58,880
isolation

462
00:17:58,880 --> 00:18:01,039
as it should provide more direct and

463
00:18:01,039 --> 00:18:01,919
focused parts

464
00:18:01,919 --> 00:18:04,880
to impact this important user group and

465
00:18:04,880 --> 00:18:06,720
we have seen the benefits of performing

466
00:18:06,720 --> 00:18:07,520
comparisons

467
00:18:07,520 --> 00:18:10,400
through our study designers could also

468
00:18:10,400 --> 00:18:13,039
potentially analyze the risk scenarios

469
00:18:13,039 --> 00:18:15,360
as motivators towards understanding

470
00:18:15,360 --> 00:18:16,880
older adults needs

471
00:18:16,880 --> 00:18:18,880
and their pain points while designing

472
00:18:18,880 --> 00:18:21,280
tools for privacy

473
00:18:21,280 --> 00:18:24,160
thank you
