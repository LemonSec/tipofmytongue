00:00:00,480 --> 00:00:03,040
hello my name is stan gertler and i'm

2
00:00:03,040 --> 00:00:05,120
here to present work that ian goldberg

3
00:00:05,120 --> 00:00:07,200
and i did regarding privacy preserving

4
00:00:07,200 --> 00:00:09,519
reputation systems at the university of

5
00:00:09,519 --> 00:00:10,639
waterloo

6
00:00:10,639 --> 00:00:12,799
to set the stage i'd like to briefly

7
00:00:12,799 --> 00:00:14,880
discuss the internet more widely

8
00:00:14,880 --> 00:00:16,560
we like to make grand proclamations

9
00:00:16,560 --> 00:00:18,160
about the internet and certainly the

10
00:00:18,160 --> 00:00:20,240
internet has had a significant impact on

11
00:00:20,240 --> 00:00:22,640
the world as it develops and matures

12
00:00:22,640 --> 00:00:24,400
where we enter this work is in the

13
00:00:24,400 --> 00:00:25,840
impact the internet has had on

14
00:00:25,840 --> 00:00:26,960
connecting people

15
00:00:26,960 --> 00:00:28,640
whether that be to other people to

16
00:00:28,640 --> 00:00:30,160
services to information

17
00:00:30,160 --> 00:00:32,640
or anything else there's a class of

18
00:00:32,640 --> 00:00:34,399
internet enabled technology that we call

19
00:00:34,399 --> 00:00:35,440
disruptive

20
00:00:35,440 --> 00:00:37,280
because it disrupts some already

21
00:00:37,280 --> 00:00:39,280
existing industry or similar

22
00:00:39,280 --> 00:00:42,000
in many cases such disruptive technology

23
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:42,559
hinges

24
00:00:42,559 --> 00:00:44,399
on its ability to connect people to

25
00:00:44,399 --> 00:00:45,600
information

26
00:00:45,600 --> 00:00:47,440
if i'm selecting between products on

27
00:00:47,440 --> 00:00:49,440
amazon i need to know how good the

28
00:00:49,440 --> 00:00:50,640
product is

29
00:00:50,640 --> 00:00:52,399
generally such information is conveyed

30
00:00:52,399 --> 00:00:53,840
via reputation

31
00:00:53,840 --> 00:00:56,000
some abstract measure of quality or

32
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:57,520
reliability

33
00:00:57,520 --> 00:00:59,120
in contrast to these disruptive

34
00:00:59,120 --> 00:01:01,039
technologies some individuals who

35
00:01:01,039 --> 00:01:02,800
analyze the internet also point to what

36
00:01:02,800 --> 00:01:03,400
they term

37
00:01:03,400 --> 00:01:05,760
disintermediate of technologies or

38
00:01:05,760 --> 00:01:07,280
technologies that serve to connect

39
00:01:07,280 --> 00:01:08,400
people to other people

40
00:01:08,400 --> 00:01:11,360
in new ways this can take many forms but

41
00:01:11,360 --> 00:01:13,040
it's best exemplified in places like

42
00:01:13,040 --> 00:01:14,720
forums for small communities often

43
00:01:14,720 --> 00:01:16,479
separated by great deals of space

44
00:01:16,479 --> 00:01:18,960
and similar whereas for a time it was

45
00:01:18,960 --> 00:01:20,159
difficult as

46
00:01:20,159 --> 00:01:22,799
say an lgbt person to meet and discuss

47
00:01:22,799 --> 00:01:24,640
with other lgbt people about

48
00:01:24,640 --> 00:01:26,799
relevant issues the internet has often

49
00:01:26,799 --> 00:01:28,560
made it easier for such individuals to

50
00:01:28,560 --> 00:01:30,000
become connected

51
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,320
to mediate such connections reputation

52
00:01:32,320 --> 00:01:34,320
again is often used to encourage

53
00:01:34,320 --> 00:01:36,799
desirable community behavior

54
00:01:36,799 --> 00:01:39,119
in both of these cases the integrity of

55
00:01:39,119 --> 00:01:40,640
these connections is of great

56
00:01:40,640 --> 00:01:42,960
importance people want to be sure that

57
00:01:42,960 --> 00:01:44,880
the reviews of a product on amazon are

58
00:01:44,880 --> 00:01:45,680
legitimate

59
00:01:45,680 --> 00:01:48,159
and people want to know when interacting

60
00:01:48,159 --> 00:01:49,520
in community settings

61
00:01:49,520 --> 00:01:51,920
what an individual's reputation is to

62
00:01:51,920 --> 00:01:53,759
help determine if they may be acting in

63
00:01:53,759 --> 00:01:55,040
bad faith

64
00:01:55,040 --> 00:01:58,000
this is at times at odds with privacy

65
00:01:58,000 --> 00:01:58,799
what does it mean

66
00:01:58,799 --> 00:02:01,920
for example to trust an anonymous user

67
00:02:01,920 --> 00:02:04,320
in this work we highlight and analyze

68
00:02:04,320 --> 00:02:06,240
previous work that is in different ways

69
00:02:06,240 --> 00:02:10,239
attempted to bridge these two ideas

70
00:02:10,239 --> 00:02:12,000
the rest of this talk proceeds as

71
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:14,480
follows we will discuss the methodology

72
00:02:14,480 --> 00:02:15,520
we use to select

73
00:02:15,520 --> 00:02:17,440
previous work for analysis we will

74
00:02:17,440 --> 00:02:19,760
define some terms particularly in areas

75
00:02:19,760 --> 00:02:21,200
where previous work has not yet

76
00:02:21,200 --> 00:02:22,000
converged

77
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:24,160
we will discuss specifically reputation

78
00:02:24,160 --> 00:02:26,160
functions which are the methods by which

79
00:02:26,160 --> 00:02:27,840
aggregated votes for reputation are

80
00:02:27,840 --> 00:02:29,840
reduced to a displayed score

81
00:02:29,840 --> 00:02:32,239
we will discuss our systematization of

82
00:02:32,239 --> 00:02:33,599
the previous works

83
00:02:33,599 --> 00:02:35,519
and the implications of the categories

84
00:02:35,519 --> 00:02:37,440
we chose we will suggest

85
00:02:37,440 --> 00:02:39,280
opportunities that future research may

86
00:02:39,280 --> 00:02:43,120
engage in and finally we will conclude

87
00:02:43,120 --> 00:02:44,959
there have been a number of academic

88
00:02:44,959 --> 00:02:47,200
papers which address privacy preserving

89
00:02:47,200 --> 00:02:50,000
reputation systems in some capacity in

90
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:51,120
order to select as

91
00:02:51,120 --> 00:02:52,800
wide an assortment of appropriate works

92
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:55,360
as we could we began with a seed paper

93
00:02:55,360 --> 00:02:57,280
a non-rep towards tracking resistant

94
00:02:57,280 --> 00:02:58,720
anonymous reputation

95
00:02:58,720 --> 00:03:01,120
presented by jai at all searching

96
00:03:01,120 --> 00:03:02,879
through all papers that it's cited and

97
00:03:02,879 --> 00:03:04,400
all papers that cited it

98
00:03:04,400 --> 00:03:06,560
we selected papers if and only if they

99
00:03:06,560 --> 00:03:08,400
described a system that supported

100
00:03:08,400 --> 00:03:10,720
a vote operation of some kind and they

101
00:03:10,720 --> 00:03:12,480
preserved at least one of our recognized

102
00:03:12,480 --> 00:03:14,159
privacy properties

103
00:03:14,159 --> 00:03:16,159
this process was iteratively repeated

104
00:03:16,159 --> 00:03:18,080
with the found papers until convergence

105
00:03:18,080 --> 00:03:18,879
was reached

106
00:03:18,879 --> 00:03:21,040
whereupon we had found 42 systems

107
00:03:21,040 --> 00:03:24,480
described across 45 papers

108
00:03:24,480 --> 00:03:27,680
onto terminology to now previous work

109
00:03:27,680 --> 00:03:29,440
has not converged on a set of standard

110
00:03:29,440 --> 00:03:30,159
terms

111
00:03:30,159 --> 00:03:32,480
and each individual works definition of

112
00:03:32,480 --> 00:03:34,799
terms at times obscures aspects of

113
00:03:34,799 --> 00:03:37,840
underlying design throughout this work

114
00:03:37,840 --> 00:03:40,000
in various sections we will be using

115
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:42,080
three terms specifically that we need to

116
00:03:42,080 --> 00:03:42,560
define

117
00:03:42,560 --> 00:03:44,799
upfront a user in the system who

118
00:03:44,799 --> 00:03:46,879
provides an opinion on another user

119
00:03:46,879 --> 00:03:48,480
typically in the form of some kind of

120
00:03:48,480 --> 00:03:50,959
vote is termed a voter

121
00:03:50,959 --> 00:03:53,280
the user who is being judged is termed a

122
00:03:53,280 --> 00:03:54,480
votee

123
00:03:54,480 --> 00:03:56,720
and occasionally a user will want to

124
00:03:56,720 --> 00:03:58,560
know the reputation of another without

125
00:03:58,560 --> 00:03:59,760
passing judgment

126
00:03:59,760 --> 00:04:02,959
such users are requesters getting into

127
00:04:02,959 --> 00:04:04,000
more specifics

128
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:05,680
there are three key areas of

129
00:04:05,680 --> 00:04:08,000
inconsistency in previous works

130
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:10,799
architecture reputation directionality

131
00:04:10,799 --> 00:04:13,840
and privacy properties

132
00:04:13,840 --> 00:04:15,760
order to guarantee the integrity of

133
00:04:15,760 --> 00:04:17,279
reputation scores

134
00:04:17,279 --> 00:04:19,199
privacy-preserving reputation systems

135
00:04:19,199 --> 00:04:20,880
have a variety of techniques

136
00:04:20,880 --> 00:04:23,840
which we classify in three broad manners

137
00:04:23,840 --> 00:04:26,400
the most common is third-party mediation

138
00:04:26,400 --> 00:04:28,720
and most commercial reputation systems

139
00:04:28,720 --> 00:04:29,919
such as amazon

140
00:04:29,919 --> 00:04:32,479
work this way a trusted third party

141
00:04:32,479 --> 00:04:33,520
collects votes

142
00:04:33,520 --> 00:04:35,919
reduces them to a score and then reports

143
00:04:35,919 --> 00:04:37,280
that score

144
00:04:37,280 --> 00:04:39,120
other works employ what we term

145
00:04:39,120 --> 00:04:41,040
ephemeral mesh topology

146
00:04:41,040 --> 00:04:43,120
in such works requesters communicate

147
00:04:43,120 --> 00:04:44,560
directly with voters

148
00:04:44,560 --> 00:04:46,080
interacting with a set of them to

149
00:04:46,080 --> 00:04:49,120
receive a score reached between that set

150
00:04:49,120 --> 00:04:50,479
you might imagine something like

151
00:04:50,479 --> 00:04:52,320
considering an applicant to a position

152
00:04:52,320 --> 00:04:53,680
by checking the opinions of their

153
00:04:53,680 --> 00:04:55,520
references and others you know and trust

154
00:04:55,520 --> 00:04:58,000
to pass judgment

155
00:04:58,000 --> 00:04:59,840
more recent work employs proofs of

156
00:04:59,840 --> 00:05:02,479
validity where the system enables a vote

157
00:05:02,479 --> 00:05:04,240
to report their score directly to a

158
00:05:04,240 --> 00:05:05,039
requester

159
00:05:05,039 --> 00:05:07,120
because it is guaranteed by some form of

160
00:05:07,120 --> 00:05:09,280
proof you might imagine something like

161
00:05:09,280 --> 00:05:11,759
accepting a document from an individual

162
00:05:11,759 --> 00:05:14,160
because it bears a specific stamp or

163
00:05:14,160 --> 00:05:18,560
watermark when discussing a reputation

164
00:05:18,560 --> 00:05:20,800
it can apply in different ways depending

165
00:05:20,800 --> 00:05:22,000
on the system

166
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:24,320
we highlight three different directions

167
00:05:24,320 --> 00:05:26,400
that reputation can flow

168
00:05:26,400 --> 00:05:28,880
in a simplex reputation system there are

169
00:05:28,880 --> 00:05:30,560
two distinct sets of users

170
00:05:30,560 --> 00:05:33,440
who in my customers and sellers and the

171
00:05:33,440 --> 00:05:35,440
system only allows for a customer to

172
00:05:35,440 --> 00:05:37,360
pass judgment on a seller

173
00:05:37,360 --> 00:05:39,520
amazon as a well-known example would be

174
00:05:39,520 --> 00:05:41,759
best described as simplex

175
00:05:41,759 --> 00:05:44,479
in a half duplex reputation system these

176
00:05:44,479 --> 00:05:46,560
two distinct sets of users are still

177
00:05:46,560 --> 00:05:49,520
present but both may judge each other

178
00:05:49,520 --> 00:05:50,160
ebay

179
00:05:50,160 --> 00:05:51,840
where customers review sellers in

180
00:05:51,840 --> 00:05:53,600
delivering their goods and sellers

181
00:05:53,600 --> 00:05:55,600
review customers on honestly providing

182
00:05:55,600 --> 00:05:56,319
payment

183
00:05:56,319 --> 00:05:58,639
is a good example of an half duplex

184
00:05:58,639 --> 00:05:59,759
system

185
00:05:59,759 --> 00:06:02,160
finally in a full duplex reputation

186
00:06:02,160 --> 00:06:02,880
system

187
00:06:02,880 --> 00:06:05,039
the distinction between users is not

188
00:06:05,039 --> 00:06:07,520
present such that there is only one set

189
00:06:07,520 --> 00:06:10,319
peers reddit where different users all

190
00:06:10,319 --> 00:06:12,160
rate each other for their posts

191
00:06:12,160 --> 00:06:14,160
is a good example of a full duplex

192
00:06:14,160 --> 00:06:15,440
system

193
00:06:15,440 --> 00:06:17,520
various privacy preserving reputation

194
00:06:17,520 --> 00:06:20,160
systems seek to protect different things

195
00:06:20,160 --> 00:06:22,720
we identify four privacy properties in

196
00:06:22,720 --> 00:06:23,360
total

197
00:06:23,360 --> 00:06:25,360
two which apply directly to voters and

198
00:06:25,360 --> 00:06:28,000
two which apply directly to votees

199
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:29,759
among the voter specific privacy

200
00:06:29,759 --> 00:06:32,319

207
00:06:44,240 --> 00:06:45,759
two different votes in a system

208
00:06:45,759 --> 00:06:47,440
could determine whether or not they were

209
00:06:47,440 --> 00:06:50,000
made by the same individual

210
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:52,000
among the votee specific privacy

211
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:53,599

usage unlinkability discusses whether or

213
00:06:55,919 --> 00:06:57,199
not a votee can

214
00:06:57,199 --> 00:06:59,360
in some manner within the system refer

215
00:06:59,360 --> 00:07:01,360
to their valid reputation score

216
00:07:01,360 --> 00:07:03,120
without making it so that each time they

217
00:07:03,120 --> 00:07:05,440
do so they link themselves between each

218
00:07:05,440 --> 00:07:06,560

220
00:07:08,800 --> 00:07:11,039
whether or not votes must divulge the

221
00:07:11,039 --> 00:07:12,880
exact reputation score they bear when

222
00:07:12,880 --> 00:07:14,479
they use it or whether they can

223
00:07:14,479 --> 00:07:17,919
fuzz it in some manner with those terms

224
00:07:17,919 --> 00:07:18,479
in place

225
00:07:18,479 --> 00:07:20,800
we move on to a discussion of reputation

226
00:07:20,800 --> 00:07:22,160
functions

227
00:07:22,160 --> 00:07:24,000
in all reputation systems there is

228
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:25,840
typically some way to aggregate the

229
00:07:25,840 --> 00:07:27,919
opinions of users into one displayed

230
00:07:27,919 --> 00:07:28,639
score

231
00:07:28,639 --> 00:07:30,479
and this is done by a reputation

232
00:07:30,479 --> 00:07:32,639
function we classify reputation

233
00:07:32,639 --> 00:07:34,960
functions into one of two categories

234
00:07:34,960 --> 00:07:38,160
voter agnostic and voter conscious in a

235
00:07:38,160 --> 00:07:41,199
voter agnostic reputation function

236
00:07:41,199 --> 00:07:43,039
the function does not differentiate

237
00:07:43,039 --> 00:07:44,720
votes by whether or not the same user

238
00:07:44,720 --> 00:07:45,680
cast them

239
00:07:45,680 --> 00:07:48,319
that is if one voter cast multiple valid

240
00:07:48,319 --> 00:07:49,680
votes for one votee

241
00:07:49,680 --> 00:07:51,919
they would all count separately we term

242
00:07:51,919 --> 00:07:53,919
the main two such functions accrue stars

243
00:07:53,919 --> 00:07:54,960
in average stars

244
00:07:54,960 --> 00:07:56,479
though they would just as well be known

245
00:07:56,479 --> 00:07:58,240
as sum and mean

246
00:07:58,240 --> 00:08:00,639
in accrue stars votes typically take the

247
00:08:00,639 --> 00:08:02,479
form of positive or negative

248
00:08:02,479 --> 00:08:04,800
and a votes score is the number of

249
00:08:04,800 --> 00:08:06,639
positive votes minus the number of

250
00:08:06,639 --> 00:08:08,000
negative votes

251
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:09,680
reddit is a good example of such a

252
00:08:09,680 --> 00:08:12,000
system in average stars

253
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:13,759
votes typically take the form of a

254
00:08:13,759 --> 00:08:15,919
number often between 1 and 5

255
00:08:15,919 --> 00:08:18,240
and a vote score is the mean of these

256
00:08:18,240 --> 00:08:19,199
numbers

257
00:08:19,199 --> 00:08:22,240
ebay is a good example of such a system

258
00:08:22,240 --> 00:08:24,720
in voter conscious reputation functions

259
00:08:24,720 --> 00:08:26,639
the general principle is that only the

260
00:08:26,639 --> 00:08:28,800
most recent vote that a voter gives for

261
00:08:28,800 --> 00:08:30,000
a specific vote t

262
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:32,559
will count that is they can update their

263
00:08:32,559 --> 00:08:34,240
opinion as much as they like

264
00:08:34,240 --> 00:08:37,519
but they only get one input per votee

265
00:08:37,519 --> 00:08:39,919
in short-term memory consensus such as

266
00:08:39,919 --> 00:08:41,120
something like yelp

267
00:08:41,120 --> 00:08:43,679
whenever a voter casts an update vote

268
00:08:43,679 --> 00:08:45,600
the previous vote no longer bears

269
00:08:45,600 --> 00:08:48,080
any weight on the score in long-term

270
00:08:48,080 --> 00:08:49,120
memory consensus

271
00:08:49,120 --> 00:08:51,279
on the other hand at various times a

272
00:08:51,279 --> 00:08:53,200
vote's score is recorded

273
00:08:53,200 --> 00:08:55,680
and after an update vote occurs the new

274
00:08:55,680 --> 00:08:57,760
resulting score is then averaged in some

275
00:08:57,760 --> 00:09:01,760
way with the previously recorded score

276
00:09:01,760 --> 00:09:04,160
from there we now discuss our actual

277
00:09:04,160 --> 00:09:05,839
systematization

278
00:09:05,839 --> 00:09:07,600
we compared the collected works on

279
00:09:07,600 --> 00:09:09,760
various measures such as what form their

280
00:09:09,760 --> 00:09:10,720
architecture took

281
00:09:10,720 --> 00:09:12,640
what privacy properties they provided

282
00:09:12,640 --> 00:09:14,160
and what reputation functions they

283
00:09:14,160 --> 00:09:15,200
supported

284
00:09:15,200 --> 00:09:17,360
further we grouped works into one of

285
00:09:17,360 --> 00:09:19,279
five core categories

286
00:09:19,279 --> 00:09:21,920
these are coinbase reputation systems

287
00:09:21,920 --> 00:09:24,000
signature-based reputation systems

288
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:26,560
reputation transfer secure multi-party

289
00:09:26,560 --> 00:09:28,720
computation based reputation systems

290
00:09:28,720 --> 00:09:30,959
and ticket-based reputation systems

291
00:09:30,959 --> 00:09:32,720
ticket-based reputation systems

292
00:09:32,720 --> 00:09:34,320
are further divided into two

293
00:09:34,320 --> 00:09:36,640
sub-groupings trusted third party

294
00:09:36,640 --> 00:09:39,279
and public log we will now look at each

295
00:09:39,279 --> 00:09:39,760
grouping

296
00:09:39,760 --> 00:09:42,080
in turn along with the relevant portion

297
00:09:42,080 --> 00:09:43,680
of our comparison chart

298
00:09:43,680 --> 00:09:45,600
the full detail of this chart can be

299
00:09:45,600 --> 00:09:46,720
found in the paper

300
00:09:46,720 --> 00:09:50,959
itself in a coin-based reputation system

301
00:09:50,959 --> 00:09:52,959
a typical interaction proceeds as

302
00:09:52,959 --> 00:09:54,080
follows

303
00:09:54,080 --> 00:09:56,959
alice and bob interact under pseudonyms

304
00:09:56,959 --> 00:09:58,800
alice forms an opinion of bob

305
00:09:58,800 --> 00:10:00,880
and decides that she wants to reward him

306
00:10:00,880 --> 00:10:02,640
so she does so by gifting bob

307
00:10:02,640 --> 00:10:05,120
a token or rep coin that bob can then

308
00:10:05,120 --> 00:10:06,880
hold on to in some manner

309
00:10:06,880 --> 00:10:09,440
when bob seeks to display his reputation

310
00:10:09,440 --> 00:10:11,760
he merely attests to the number of rep

311
00:10:11,760 --> 00:10:12,880
coins that he holds

312
00:10:12,880 --> 00:10:15,680
in some verifiable manner the work by

313
00:10:15,680 --> 00:10:16,880
andrew locky at all

314
00:10:16,880 --> 00:10:21,200
is a strong example of coin based system

315
00:10:21,200 --> 00:10:23,600
in a signature based reputation system a

316
00:10:23,600 --> 00:10:26,320
typical interaction proceeds as follows

317
00:10:26,320 --> 00:10:28,880
alice and bob interact under pseudonyms

318
00:10:28,880 --> 00:10:30,800
alice forms an opinion of bob

319
00:10:30,800 --> 00:10:32,800
and decides that she wants to reward him

320
00:10:32,800 --> 00:10:34,880
so she does so by providing a signature

321
00:10:34,880 --> 00:10:36,480
on something for bob

322
00:10:36,480 --> 00:10:38,320
the signature is constructed in such a

323
00:10:38,320 --> 00:10:40,240
way that bob can attest to the number of

324
00:10:40,240 --> 00:10:42,480
unique signatures that he has received

325
00:10:42,480 --> 00:10:45,120
but duplicates are ignored this number

326
00:10:45,120 --> 00:10:47,120
of unique signatures represents his

327
00:10:47,120 --> 00:10:48,800
reputation score

328
00:10:48,800 --> 00:10:50,959
signatures of reputation by bethan cord

329
00:10:50,959 --> 00:10:53,200
at all is a good example of this type of

330
00:10:53,200 --> 00:10:55,760
reputation system

331
00:10:55,760 --> 00:10:57,839
reputation transfer systems typically

332
00:10:57,839 --> 00:10:59,839
abstract the actual methods of voting

333
00:10:59,839 --> 00:11:01,519
and making scores

334
00:11:01,519 --> 00:11:03,680
instead these works focus on one

335
00:11:03,680 --> 00:11:04,959
specific problem

336
00:11:04,959 --> 00:11:07,120
namely that having only one pseudonym

337
00:11:07,120 --> 00:11:08,720
for the entire length of participation

338
00:11:08,720 --> 00:11:11,120
in the system is only a minor upgrade

339
00:11:11,120 --> 00:11:14,160
from using one's true identity because

340
00:11:14,160 --> 00:11:14,959
of this

341
00:11:14,959 --> 00:11:17,040
there is no typical full interaction for

342
00:11:17,040 --> 00:11:18,160
this approach

343
00:11:18,160 --> 00:11:20,320
however all works within this approach

344
00:11:20,320 --> 00:11:22,399
feature some procedure for votees to

345
00:11:22,399 --> 00:11:24,320
generate new pseudonyms that inherit the

346
00:11:24,320 --> 00:11:26,800
reputation of their previous pseudonyms

347
00:11:26,800 --> 00:11:28,800
typically there will be specific time

348
00:11:28,800 --> 00:11:30,480
points that votees can

349
00:11:30,480 --> 00:11:32,880
request a trusted third party to strip

350
00:11:32,880 --> 00:11:34,640
an old pseudonym from their score and

351
00:11:34,640 --> 00:11:36,560
bind it to a new pseudonym

352
00:11:36,560 --> 00:11:39,760
rup by miranda and rodriguez is a good

353
00:11:39,760 --> 00:11:43,279
example of such a system

354
00:11:43,279 --> 00:11:44,720
in a secure multi-party

355
00:11:44,720 --> 00:11:46,959
computation-based reputation system

356
00:11:46,959 --> 00:11:48,640
a typical interaction proceeds as

357
00:11:48,640 --> 00:11:51,519
follows alice wants bob's score so that

358
00:11:51,519 --> 00:11:53,040
she can determine whether or not she

359
00:11:53,040 --> 00:11:54,480
will interact with him

360
00:11:54,480 --> 00:11:57,040
she asks carol and dave their opinions

361
00:11:57,040 --> 00:11:57,680
of bob

362
00:11:57,680 --> 00:11:59,440
and they work together to composite a

363
00:11:59,440 --> 00:12:01,519
score for alice without revealing to

364
00:12:01,519 --> 00:12:04,000
alice what their individual votes were

365
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:06,320
alice decides to interact with bob and

366
00:12:06,320 --> 00:12:07,920
forms her own opinion of him

367
00:12:07,920 --> 00:12:10,320
in case she is later requested for it

368
00:12:10,320 --> 00:12:12,320
decentralized additive reputation

369
00:12:12,320 --> 00:12:14,800
systems or dars by pavlov at all

370
00:12:14,800 --> 00:12:18,320
is a good example of such a system

371
00:12:18,320 --> 00:12:20,560
in a ticket-based reputation system a

372
00:12:20,560 --> 00:12:23,120
typical interaction proceeds as follows

373
00:12:23,120 --> 00:12:25,680
alice and bob interact under pseudonyms

374
00:12:25,680 --> 00:12:27,600
else forms an opinion of bob

375
00:12:27,600 --> 00:12:29,600
and decides that she wants to share it

376
00:12:29,600 --> 00:12:31,120
as part of their interaction

377
00:12:31,120 --> 00:12:33,680
alice and bob exchange tokens or tickets

378
00:12:33,680 --> 00:12:35,440
that they can redeem as proof that they

379
00:12:35,440 --> 00:12:37,680
actually interacted with each other

380
00:12:37,680 --> 00:12:39,440
this is where the two subgroupings of

381
00:12:39,440 --> 00:12:41,680
ticket-based systems diverge

382
00:12:41,680 --> 00:12:43,519
in a trusted third-party ticket-based

383
00:12:43,519 --> 00:12:45,360
system alice cashes

384
00:12:45,360 --> 00:12:47,839
this ticket with a trusted third party

385
00:12:47,839 --> 00:12:49,360
who holds onto the vote and

386
00:12:49,360 --> 00:12:51,279
aggregates it with others for bob

387
00:12:51,279 --> 00:12:53,600
reporting the aggregated score

388
00:12:53,600 --> 00:12:55,680
in a public log ticket based system

389
00:12:55,680 --> 00:12:57,519
alice instead publishes her vote

390
00:12:57,519 --> 00:12:58,399
publicly

391
00:12:58,399 --> 00:13:00,240
along with the ticket such that any

392
00:13:00,240 --> 00:13:01,600
requester can verify

393
00:13:01,600 --> 00:13:03,279
the ticket and aggregate together the

394
00:13:03,279 --> 00:13:05,600
votes among ttp

395
00:13:05,600 --> 00:13:08,079
ticket-based systems the work by boyd at

396
00:13:08,079 --> 00:13:09,680
all is a good example

397
00:13:09,680 --> 00:13:11,440
and among public logged ticket-based

398
00:13:11,440 --> 00:13:13,360
systems beaver by sosuke

399
00:13:13,360 --> 00:13:16,480
at all is a good example with these

400
00:13:16,480 --> 00:13:17,600
categories in place

401
00:13:17,600 --> 00:13:19,360
we believe it is valuable to talk about

402
00:13:19,360 --> 00:13:20,800
the various trade-offs that each

403
00:13:20,800 --> 00:13:22,079
category provides

404
00:13:22,079 --> 00:13:23,680
due to the shared features of their

405
00:13:23,680 --> 00:13:25,279
underlying design

406
00:13:25,279 --> 00:13:26,880
in coin based and signature-based

407
00:13:26,880 --> 00:13:29,040
systems voti privacy properties are

408
00:13:29,040 --> 00:13:31,200
frequently provided which is otherwise

409
00:13:31,200 --> 00:13:31,920
rare

410
00:13:31,920 --> 00:13:34,480
in both cases however their design makes

411
00:13:34,480 --> 00:13:36,000
implementing reputation functions

412
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:36,720
difficult

413
00:13:36,720 --> 00:13:38,480
and often they are very limited in what

414
00:13:38,480 --> 00:13:39,920
they can provide

415
00:13:39,920 --> 00:13:42,560
in both signature based and smc based

416
00:13:42,560 --> 00:13:43,279
systems

417
00:13:43,279 --> 00:13:44,800
the systems tend to be very

418
00:13:44,800 --> 00:13:46,320
decentralized and

419
00:13:46,320 --> 00:13:48,320
limited trust is placed in any single

420
00:13:48,320 --> 00:13:50,160
party regarding just

421
00:13:50,160 --> 00:13:52,720
smc based systems because voters must be

422
00:13:52,720 --> 00:13:54,560
able to respond to requests for a given

423
00:13:54,560 --> 00:13:56,480
votee's reputation score

424
00:13:56,480 --> 00:13:58,560
votee privacy properties are difficult

425
00:13:58,560 --> 00:14:00,880
to implement and such systems typically

426
00:14:00,880 --> 00:14:02,000
require voters to

427
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:04,959
always be online ticket-based systems

428
00:14:04,959 --> 00:14:07,040
have a great deal of variety

429
00:14:07,040 --> 00:14:09,360
and ttp ticket-based systems there's

430
00:14:09,360 --> 00:14:11,360
typically much flexibility in terms of

431
00:14:11,360 --> 00:14:13,199
what privacy properties can be provided

432
00:14:13,199 --> 00:14:15,120
and what reputation functions can be

433
00:14:15,120 --> 00:14:16,079
employed

434
00:14:16,079 --> 00:14:18,560
as using a trusted third party makes

435
00:14:18,560 --> 00:14:20,160
many of these questions

436
00:14:20,160 --> 00:14:23,360
much simpler however they of course rely

437
00:14:23,360 --> 00:14:25,519
on some level of centralization

438
00:14:25,519 --> 00:14:27,680
with varying amounts of trust placed on

439
00:14:27,680 --> 00:14:29,360
these central servers

440
00:14:29,360 --> 00:14:31,360
public log ticket-based systems on the

441
00:14:31,360 --> 00:14:33,279
other hand do tend to be fairly

442
00:14:33,279 --> 00:14:34,560
decentralized

443
00:14:34,560 --> 00:14:36,560
note that though they are subject of the

444
00:14:36,560 --> 00:14:38,800
same concerns around hijacking consensus

445
00:14:38,800 --> 00:14:40,800
that blockchains typically are

446
00:14:40,800 --> 00:14:43,279
public log ticket-based systems like

447
00:14:43,279 --> 00:14:44,160
based systems

448
00:14:44,160 --> 00:14:46,320
have difficulty implementing voti

449
00:14:46,320 --> 00:14:49,040
privacy properties

450
00:14:49,040 --> 00:14:51,519
in discussing these systems of course

451
00:14:51,519 --> 00:14:53,680
one of our main goals is in determining

452
00:14:53,680 --> 00:14:54,880
what research gaps

453
00:14:54,880 --> 00:14:57,120
if any exist that we may fill them with

454
00:14:57,120 --> 00:14:58,480
future work

455
00:14:58,480 --> 00:15:00,720
to this end we identify three main

456
00:15:00,720 --> 00:15:02,560
points that we believe are important and

457
00:15:02,560 --> 00:15:04,639
useful moving forward

458
00:15:04,639 --> 00:15:06,959
first decentralization does not have to

459
00:15:06,959 --> 00:15:08,320
mean launching

460
00:15:08,320 --> 00:15:10,560
this may sound pithy but a great deal of

461
00:15:10,560 --> 00:15:12,240
recent work has focused on blockchain

462
00:15:12,240 --> 00:15:14,320
approaches to reduce centralization in

463
00:15:14,320 --> 00:15:15,279
systems

464
00:15:15,279 --> 00:15:17,040
this makes sense though blockchain

465
00:15:17,040 --> 00:15:19,120
approaches have significant limitations

466
00:15:19,120 --> 00:15:20,880
even with ignoring the concerns around

467
00:15:20,880 --> 00:15:22,560
blockchain itself

468
00:15:22,560 --> 00:15:24,639
in raising this point we particularly

469
00:15:24,639 --> 00:15:26,800
mean to highlight the decentralization

470
00:15:26,800 --> 00:15:29,440
includes methods that distribute trust

471
00:15:29,440 --> 00:15:31,440
across multiple central nodes

472
00:15:31,440 --> 00:15:33,519
and we note a few such examples in the

473
00:15:33,519 --> 00:15:35,600
paper decentralization

474
00:15:35,600 --> 00:15:38,160
is valuable but it must be undertaken in

475
00:15:38,160 --> 00:15:39,040
concert with

476
00:15:39,040 --> 00:15:40,639
other goals for what a privacy

477
00:15:40,639 --> 00:15:43,199
preserving reputation system can provide

478
00:15:43,199 --> 00:15:44,959
and there is still a great deal of

479
00:15:44,959 --> 00:15:46,720
interesting research to be done on how

480
00:15:46,720 --> 00:15:48,240
systems moving forward

481
00:15:48,240 --> 00:15:50,320
can't be decentralized even without

482
00:15:50,320 --> 00:15:52,000
blockchain

483
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:54,880
second reputation usage unlinkability

484
00:15:54,880 --> 00:15:57,120
and photoconscious reputation functions

485
00:15:57,120 --> 00:15:58,720
would make a particularly potent

486
00:15:58,720 --> 00:16:00,399
combination when used in community

487
00:16:00,399 --> 00:16:01,440
settings

488
00:16:01,440 --> 00:16:04,000
in places like forms offering increased

489
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:06,240
anonymity may be of considerable value

490
00:16:06,240 --> 00:16:08,240
so long as it is balanced against its

491
00:16:08,240 --> 00:16:09,360
misuse

492
00:16:09,360 --> 00:16:11,279
in these sorts of limited settings where

493
00:16:11,279 --> 00:16:12,959
users are more likely to interact with

494
00:16:12,959 --> 00:16:14,320
each other regularly

495
00:16:14,320 --> 00:16:16,240
voter conscious reputation functions are

496
00:16:16,240 --> 00:16:18,480
most meaningful as the derived score

497
00:16:18,480 --> 00:16:19,920
reflects an actual knowledge of the

498
00:16:19,920 --> 00:16:21,040
community about an

499
00:16:21,040 --> 00:16:23,759
individual if in this setting a vote

500
00:16:23,759 --> 00:16:25,600
cannot earn positive ratings from a

501
00:16:25,600 --> 00:16:27,279
reasonable number of voters

502
00:16:27,279 --> 00:16:29,600
it seems reasonable to conclude that

503
00:16:29,600 --> 00:16:30,480
said votee

504
00:16:30,480 --> 00:16:32,720
may not be a good fit for or is not

505
00:16:32,720 --> 00:16:34,160
acting in good faith within

506
00:16:34,160 --> 00:16:37,120
a given community few academic works

507
00:16:37,120 --> 00:16:38,560
have explored this particular

508
00:16:38,560 --> 00:16:40,079
combination to this point

509
00:16:40,079 --> 00:16:42,800
and future work could be fruitful

510
00:16:42,800 --> 00:16:43,519
finally

511
00:16:43,519 --> 00:16:45,360
at this time in the literature

512
00:16:45,360 --> 00:16:47,920
reputation is limited to applying by

513
00:16:47,920 --> 00:16:51,279
and to individual users there are two

514
00:16:51,279 --> 00:16:52,959
important ways the literature could

515
00:16:52,959 --> 00:16:55,519
expand its uses for reputation

516
00:16:55,519 --> 00:16:58,160
first avotee's rating could be decided

517
00:16:58,160 --> 00:17:00,800
by specific subsets of voters

518
00:17:00,800 --> 00:17:02,160
knowing the opinions of multiple

519
00:17:02,160 --> 00:17:04,640
different groups may be valuable to a

520
00:17:04,640 --> 00:17:06,000
requester

521
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:08,400
second in no systems in the literature

522
00:17:08,400 --> 00:17:10,559
does reputation refer to the opinions of

523
00:17:10,559 --> 00:17:12,959
voters towards a group of votees

524
00:17:12,959 --> 00:17:16,240
these votes might represent for example

525
00:17:16,240 --> 00:17:18,000
all the sellers of a certain kind of

526
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:20,319
product and reputation would indicate

527
00:17:20,319 --> 00:17:22,160
satisfaction with that kind of product

528
00:17:22,160 --> 00:17:25,199
overall expanding reputation beyond the

529
00:17:25,199 --> 00:17:25,919
individual

530
00:17:25,919 --> 00:17:28,079
holds promise for new research in

531
00:17:28,079 --> 00:17:30,880
multiple directions

532
00:17:30,880 --> 00:17:34,160
in this work we systematized 42

533
00:17:34,160 --> 00:17:36,880
privacy-preserving reputation systems we

534
00:17:36,880 --> 00:17:38,559
raised issues of inconsistent

535
00:17:38,559 --> 00:17:40,240
terminology in the literature

536
00:17:40,240 --> 00:17:42,160
we identified important trade-offs

537
00:17:42,160 --> 00:17:44,960
inherent to design choices among systems

538
00:17:44,960 --> 00:17:47,039
and we identified three key areas where

539
00:17:47,039 --> 00:17:48,880
research can't go further

540
00:17:48,880 --> 00:17:50,960
privacy and reputation though times and

541
00:17:50,960 --> 00:17:52,240
tension with one another

542
00:17:52,240 --> 00:17:53,919
can be matched together in ways that

543
00:17:53,919 --> 00:17:56,160
could have significant impact

544
00:17:56,160 --> 00:17:58,760
with that thank you for your time and

545
00:17:58,760 --> 00:18:01,760
attention
