00:00:00,160 --> 00:00:03,600
hi today i will present our work on

2
00:00:03,600 --> 00:00:05,279
cname-based tracking

3
00:00:05,279 --> 00:00:07,359
and our paper called the c name of the

4
00:00:07,359 --> 00:00:10,000
game large-scale analysis of dns based

5
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:11,679
tracking invasion

6
00:00:11,679 --> 00:00:13,599
our work was in collaboration with

7
00:00:13,599 --> 00:00:15,440
ganesh from kosic

8
00:00:15,440 --> 00:00:17,920
lukash an independent researcher and

9
00:00:17,920 --> 00:00:18,960
router and tom

10
00:00:18,960 --> 00:00:21,920
from distrinet

11
00:00:22,320 --> 00:00:24,400
traditional third-party tracking works

12
00:00:24,400 --> 00:00:26,000
in the following way

13
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:28,240
when a user visits a website that uses a

14
00:00:28,240 --> 00:00:29,279
certain tracker

15
00:00:29,279 --> 00:00:31,920
in this case tracker.com the browser

16
00:00:31,920 --> 00:00:34,160
sends a request to both the website and

17
00:00:34,160 --> 00:00:36,079
the server of the tracker

18
00:00:36,079 --> 00:00:38,399
the tracker then responds with a cookie

19
00:00:38,399 --> 00:00:39,680
containing a unique

20
00:00:39,680 --> 00:00:42,399
identifier for the user this cookie is

21
00:00:42,399 --> 00:00:43,600
stored in the browser

22
00:00:43,600 --> 00:00:47,200
under the domain of the tracker

23
00:00:47,440 --> 00:00:49,520
when the user visits a different website

24
00:00:49,520 --> 00:00:51,680
embedding the same tracker

25
00:00:51,680 --> 00:00:53,520
the identifying cookie will be sent

26
00:00:53,520 --> 00:00:55,760
along with a request to the tracker

27
00:00:55,760 --> 00:00:57,520
this way the tracker knows that it was

28
00:00:57,520 --> 00:01:00,559
the same user that visited both websites

29
00:01:00,559 --> 00:01:02,480
and is able to build a behavior or

30
00:01:02,480 --> 00:01:04,720
profile of the user

31
00:01:04,720 --> 00:01:07,040
so this raises privacy concerns for

32
00:01:07,040 --> 00:01:10,240
users on the web

33
00:01:10,479 --> 00:01:12,880
for this reason there are a number of

34
00:01:12,880 --> 00:01:13,520
tools

35
00:01:13,520 --> 00:01:15,360
that users can employ to protect their

36
00:01:15,360 --> 00:01:17,119
privacy on the web

37
00:01:17,119 --> 00:01:19,439
on the one hand users can install

38
00:01:19,439 --> 00:01:20,720
extensions

39
00:01:20,720 --> 00:01:23,280
browser extensions such as adblock plus

40
00:01:23,280 --> 00:01:25,600
privacy badger and ghost3

41
00:01:25,600 --> 00:01:27,680
which block requests to third-party

42
00:01:27,680 --> 00:01:30,000
trackers trackers all together

43
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,479
on the other hand some browsers have

44
00:01:32,479 --> 00:01:34,479
built-in tracking protection

45
00:01:34,479 --> 00:01:37,520
for instance safari has its own

46
00:01:37,520 --> 00:01:38,479
mechanism

47
00:01:38,479 --> 00:01:40,880
called intelligent tracking prevention

48
00:01:40,880 --> 00:01:42,560
which basically deletes cookies on

49
00:01:42,560 --> 00:01:43,759
websites that haven't

50
00:01:43,759 --> 00:01:45,920
been accessed in a while preventing

51
00:01:45,920 --> 00:01:47,520
cross-site tracking

52
00:01:47,520 --> 00:01:49,759
firefox has tracking protection enabled

53
00:01:49,759 --> 00:01:50,799
by default

54
00:01:50,799 --> 00:01:52,479
and while chrome does not provide

55
00:01:52,479 --> 00:01:54,799
tracking protection by default yet

56
00:01:54,799 --> 00:01:56,560
it is planning on phasing out third

57
00:01:56,560 --> 00:02:00,719
party cookies all together in the future

58
00:02:01,680 --> 00:02:04,000
so on the one hand we have publishers

59
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:06,399
who use the services of advertisers and

60
00:02:06,399 --> 00:02:07,040
trackers

61
00:02:07,040 --> 00:02:10,318
to monetize the content versus the users

62
00:02:10,318 --> 00:02:12,080
who try to protect themselves from

63
00:02:12,080 --> 00:02:14,080
online tracking by using tracker

64
00:02:14,080 --> 00:02:15,840
blocking tools

65
00:02:15,840 --> 00:02:18,480
as a reaction to the use of those tools

66
00:02:18,480 --> 00:02:19,680
trackers

67
00:02:19,680 --> 00:02:21,599
try to come up with new ways to

68
00:02:21,599 --> 00:02:23,360
circumvent them

69
00:02:23,360 --> 00:02:25,680
our paper studies one of the most novel

70
00:02:25,680 --> 00:02:26,400
techniques

71
00:02:26,400 --> 00:02:28,879
used by trackers called cname based

72
00:02:28,879 --> 00:02:29,599
tracking

73
00:02:29,599 --> 00:02:33,119
which works in the following way

74
00:02:33,680 --> 00:02:35,920
instead of issuing a request to the

75
00:02:35,920 --> 00:02:37,200
third party tracker

76
00:02:37,200 --> 00:02:39,599
the website visited by the user issues a

77
00:02:39,599 --> 00:02:42,400
request to a subdomain of the website

78
00:02:42,400 --> 00:02:44,400
the subdomain is used by the tracker in

79
00:02:44,400 --> 00:02:47,040
this case track.example.com

80
00:02:47,040 --> 00:02:48,959
the tracker responds with an analytics

81
00:02:48,959 --> 00:02:50,640
script and sets a first

82
00:02:50,640 --> 00:02:53,519
party cookie it looks as if the request

83
00:02:53,519 --> 00:02:55,360
is simply fetching a resource from its

84
00:02:55,360 --> 00:02:57,120
subdomain

85
00:02:57,120 --> 00:03:00,800
however on the dns level the first party

86
00:03:00,800 --> 00:03:02,319
subdomain of the website

87
00:03:02,319 --> 00:03:04,319
is linked to a third party domain

88
00:03:04,319 --> 00:03:06,879
belonging to the actual tracker

89
00:03:06,879 --> 00:03:09,519
the request disguises itself as being a

90
00:03:09,519 --> 00:03:09,920
first

91
00:03:09,920 --> 00:03:12,560
party subdomain of the website therefore

92
00:03:12,560 --> 00:03:14,720
circumventing blockless based tracking

93
00:03:14,720 --> 00:03:16,239
protections

94
00:03:16,239 --> 00:03:18,239
it is important to note that as the

95
00:03:18,239 --> 00:03:19,920
tracker is included in a first party

96
00:03:19,920 --> 00:03:22,400
context to the visited website

97
00:03:22,400 --> 00:03:24,480
the tracker will not be able to track

98
00:03:24,480 --> 00:03:26,400
the user across different websites

99
00:03:26,400 --> 00:03:28,400
cna based tracking is a type of first

100
00:03:28,400 --> 00:03:29,840
party tracking

101
00:03:29,840 --> 00:03:32,319
however this limitation can be bypassed

102
00:03:32,319 --> 00:03:34,319
by using cookie syncing as we will see

103
00:03:34,319 --> 00:03:37,359
further in the presentation

104
00:03:37,920 --> 00:03:41,599
so how do we detect cname based tracking

105
00:03:41,599 --> 00:03:44,239
first of all we need cname records and

106
00:03:44,239 --> 00:03:44,879
not just

107
00:03:44,879 --> 00:03:47,280
any kind of scene records but cname

108
00:03:47,280 --> 00:03:48,319
records

109
00:03:48,319 --> 00:03:51,120
from a first party to a third party

110
00:03:51,120 --> 00:03:52,239
domain

111
00:03:52,239 --> 00:03:54,720
in our example we would look for a cname

112
00:03:54,720 --> 00:03:57,200
record from track.example.com

113
00:03:57,200 --> 00:04:02,159
towards x dot x.tracker.com

114
00:04:02,159 --> 00:04:04,239
for our analysis we use the public data

115
00:04:04,239 --> 00:04:07,280
set of http archive which contains

116
00:04:07,280 --> 00:04:11,120
millions of frequently visited websites

117
00:04:11,120 --> 00:04:14,319
from the chrome user experience report

118
00:04:14,319 --> 00:04:16,959
and using this data set we looked for

119
00:04:16,959 --> 00:04:17,839
first party

120
00:04:17,839 --> 00:04:21,759
requests to a subdomain of the same site

121
00:04:21,759 --> 00:04:24,800
again from our example we look for

122
00:04:24,800 --> 00:04:27,560
requests from example.com to

123
00:04:27,560 --> 00:04:28,960
tracker.example.com

124
00:04:28,960 --> 00:04:31,759
and by combining these two steps we are

125
00:04:31,759 --> 00:04:33,680
able to set up a list

126
00:04:33,680 --> 00:04:37,520
of c name tracker candidates

127
00:04:37,520 --> 00:04:41,120
however not all

128
00:04:41,120 --> 00:04:44,320
services that use cname records

129
00:04:44,320 --> 00:04:47,440
are per se trackers for instance

130
00:04:47,440 --> 00:04:50,560
cdns also use cna records to connect

131
00:04:50,560 --> 00:04:53,360
with their customers

132
00:04:53,360 --> 00:04:55,520
so in third step we perform a manual

133
00:04:55,520 --> 00:04:56,479
analysis

134
00:04:56,479 --> 00:04:59,120
on each of the tracking candidates we

135
00:04:59,120 --> 00:05:00,000
analyzed

136
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:01,759
their website and we looked for

137
00:05:01,759 --> 00:05:03,759
references to tracking

138
00:05:03,759 --> 00:05:06,639
or analytics or features mentioned on

139
00:05:06,639 --> 00:05:08,840
their website that require tracking or

140
00:05:08,840 --> 00:05:10,000
analytics

141
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:12,800
so we obtained 13 manually verified

142
00:05:12,800 --> 00:05:13,440
trackers

143
00:05:13,440 --> 00:05:15,600
and for each of these trackers we

144
00:05:15,600 --> 00:05:17,520
constructed a tracker specific

145
00:05:17,520 --> 00:05:19,120
fingerprint which allows us to

146
00:05:19,120 --> 00:05:20,160
distinguish

147
00:05:20,160 --> 00:05:22,479
actual tracking requests to the scene

148
00:05:22,479 --> 00:05:23,600
trackers

149
00:05:23,600 --> 00:05:26,880
from other traffic in the last part of

150
00:05:26,880 --> 00:05:27,680
our analysis

151
00:05:27,680 --> 00:05:29,440
we ran an additional crawl with a

152
00:05:29,440 --> 00:05:32,320
different user agent namely safari

153
00:05:32,320 --> 00:05:35,120
and we found one tracker that was only

154
00:05:35,120 --> 00:05:35,680
tracking

155
00:05:35,680 --> 00:05:38,240
safari users they also branded

156
00:05:38,240 --> 00:05:39,039
themselves

157
00:05:39,039 --> 00:05:42,479
as specifically circumventing safari's

158
00:05:42,479 --> 00:05:45,919
intelligent tracking prevention

159
00:05:47,759 --> 00:05:51,120
this table shows our results for the 13

160
00:05:51,120 --> 00:05:54,479
different trackers we as we detected

161
00:05:54,479 --> 00:05:57,440
the number of publisher websites using

162
00:05:57,440 --> 00:05:58,560
them

163
00:05:58,560 --> 00:06:01,199
and we also estimated the actual number

164
00:06:01,199 --> 00:06:03,039
of websites using them and this number

165
00:06:03,039 --> 00:06:04,000
is a

166
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:06,800
a lot higher we achieved this by using

167
00:06:06,800 --> 00:06:08,880
reverse dns

168
00:06:08,880 --> 00:06:12,479
we also noted the price that the service

169
00:06:12,479 --> 00:06:15,520
the price of the service if it was

170
00:06:15,520 --> 00:06:16,400
available

171
00:06:16,400 --> 00:06:19,600
on their website and finally we had a

172
00:06:19,600 --> 00:06:20,160
look at

173
00:06:20,160 --> 00:06:23,600
whether the view block origin tool on

174
00:06:23,600 --> 00:06:26,000
firefox and on chrome was able to block

175
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:28,720
requests to those cname trackers and

176
00:06:28,720 --> 00:06:30,560
whether the tracker was included in the

177
00:06:30,560 --> 00:06:33,120
next cnsc name block list

178
00:06:33,120 --> 00:06:35,520
this is a list which we also used to

179
00:06:35,520 --> 00:06:37,759
extend our list of synonym trackers

180
00:06:37,759 --> 00:06:41,120
considering our study

181
00:06:41,680 --> 00:06:44,560
interesting results are that a number of

182
00:06:44,560 --> 00:06:45,919
synonym-based trackers

183
00:06:45,919 --> 00:06:49,120
are blocked by the u-block origin

184
00:06:49,120 --> 00:06:51,599
extension on firefox but not on chrome

185
00:06:51,599 --> 00:06:53,680
this is due to the fact that firefox has

186
00:06:53,680 --> 00:06:56,240
implemented a dns level defense

187
00:06:56,240 --> 00:06:58,400
against cnn based tracking which is

188
00:06:58,400 --> 00:06:59,919
technically not possible

189
00:06:59,919 --> 00:07:01,919
because of the limitations of the dns

190
00:07:01,919 --> 00:07:05,039
api in chrome

191
00:07:06,160 --> 00:07:09,759
further i'll we detected

192
00:07:09,759 --> 00:07:13,759
a number of of cname based trackers

193
00:07:13,759 --> 00:07:16,560
which were previously not unknown to

194
00:07:16,560 --> 00:07:17,840
tracker

195
00:07:17,840 --> 00:07:21,440
tracker blocking lists

196
00:07:25,599 --> 00:07:27,919
we examined the popularity of publisher

197
00:07:27,919 --> 00:07:29,520
websites to use cname name-based

198
00:07:29,520 --> 00:07:30,319
tracking

199
00:07:30,319 --> 00:07:32,960
according to the tranquil rank or their

200
00:07:32,960 --> 00:07:34,880
popularity rank of their website

201
00:07:34,880 --> 00:07:37,440
and we find that the z-name-based

202
00:07:37,440 --> 00:07:38,880
tracking websites

203
00:07:38,880 --> 00:07:41,120
are heavily biased towards very popular

204
00:07:41,120 --> 00:07:42,240
websites almost

205
00:07:42,240 --> 00:07:44,879
10 of the websites that use cnn based

206
00:07:44,879 --> 00:07:46,879
tracking in our data set

207
00:07:46,879 --> 00:07:50,000
were in the top 10 000

208
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:51,759
most popular websites according to the

209
00:07:51,759 --> 00:07:54,160
tranco rank

210
00:07:54,160 --> 00:07:57,199
we also had a look at the categories of

211
00:07:57,199 --> 00:07:59,039
publisher websites that you see

212
00:07:59,039 --> 00:08:00,160
name-based tracking

213
00:08:00,160 --> 00:08:03,599
as a baseline we compare with the

214
00:08:03,599 --> 00:08:06,080
distribution of categories of the tranco

215
00:08:06,080 --> 00:08:08,080
top ten thousand most popular websites

216
00:08:08,080 --> 00:08:12,000
during the same time at the same time

217
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:15,759
of analysis and we see clearly that

218
00:08:15,759 --> 00:08:18,000
40 of the websites belong to the

219
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:21,520
category of business websites

220
00:08:21,520 --> 00:08:24,800
to sum up we found more than 10

221
00:08:24,800 --> 00:08:26,879
000 publisher websites using cnn based

222
00:08:26,879 --> 00:08:29,599
tracking most of which are businesses

223
00:08:29,599 --> 00:08:34,159
10 of them are are very popular websites

224
00:08:34,159 --> 00:08:36,880
and we found 13 synonym-based trackers

225
00:08:36,880 --> 00:08:38,640
in varying sizes

226
00:08:38,640 --> 00:08:41,360
and some of them were previously unknown

227
00:08:41,360 --> 00:08:44,800
to tracker blocking tools

228
00:08:47,040 --> 00:08:49,040
i will now talk about the historical

229
00:08:49,040 --> 00:08:52,240
evolution of cname based tracking

230
00:08:52,240 --> 00:08:54,800
in order to do this we again used the

231
00:08:54,800 --> 00:08:57,600
public data set of http archive

232
00:08:57,600 --> 00:09:00,080
and we use the recursive approach where

233
00:09:00,080 --> 00:09:01,440
starting from the most

234
00:09:01,440 --> 00:09:03,760
recent month of our analysis we

235
00:09:03,760 --> 00:09:04,800
determine the

236
00:09:04,800 --> 00:09:06,800
amount of cname based tracking in the

237
00:09:06,800 --> 00:09:09,120
previous month based on the cna based

238
00:09:09,120 --> 00:09:10,959
tracking in the current month

239
00:09:10,959 --> 00:09:15,920
so we obtained an analysis of 17 months

240
00:09:15,920 --> 00:09:19,040
and here we show the results

241
00:09:19,040 --> 00:09:21,120
we can see that throughout the whole

242
00:09:21,120 --> 00:09:22,160
period

243
00:09:22,160 --> 00:09:25,440
seen name based tracking and its use

244
00:09:25,440 --> 00:09:29,120
has been increasing steadily

245
00:09:29,279 --> 00:09:32,399
same site cnn based tracking refers

246
00:09:32,399 --> 00:09:36,240
to the use of a cname record that

247
00:09:36,240 --> 00:09:39,519
is same side to the visited website and

248
00:09:39,519 --> 00:09:42,880
cross side refers to the use of a domain

249
00:09:42,880 --> 00:09:44,080
that is different from the visited

250
00:09:44,080 --> 00:09:46,160
website however in most cases these

251
00:09:46,160 --> 00:09:48,240
domains were related and belonging to

252
00:09:48,240 --> 00:09:51,839
the same company

253
00:09:52,320 --> 00:09:54,640
we compared synonym-based tracking to

254
00:09:54,640 --> 00:09:56,320
third-party tracking

255
00:09:56,320 --> 00:09:59,200
and we see that while the use of

256
00:09:59,200 --> 00:10:00,800
cname-based tracking

257
00:10:00,800 --> 00:10:03,839
keeps on increasing

258
00:10:03,839 --> 00:10:07,279
the use of popular trackers

259
00:10:07,279 --> 00:10:10,399
is steady and while

260
00:10:10,399 --> 00:10:13,120
the smaller the use of smaller trackers

261
00:10:13,120 --> 00:10:14,880
keeps decreasing throughout our

262
00:10:14,880 --> 00:10:19,279
measurement period in order to assess

263
00:10:19,279 --> 00:10:20,399
the effects

264
00:10:20,399 --> 00:10:22,800
on third-party tracking of cname based

265
00:10:22,800 --> 00:10:23,839
tracking

266
00:10:23,839 --> 00:10:26,800
we had a look at the specific evolution

267
00:10:26,800 --> 00:10:28,399
of third-party tracking

268
00:10:28,399 --> 00:10:30,959
so we considered websites that had

269
00:10:30,959 --> 00:10:32,160
become recently

270
00:10:32,160 --> 00:10:34,320
customers of cname-based tracking more

271
00:10:34,320 --> 00:10:36,480
specifically we look at websites

272
00:10:36,480 --> 00:10:39,120
that were not actively using cname-based

273
00:10:39,120 --> 00:10:40,240
tracking for six months

274
00:10:40,240 --> 00:10:42,880
then we then started using it and used

275
00:10:42,880 --> 00:10:44,800
it for at least six more consecutive

276
00:10:44,800 --> 00:10:45,519
months

277
00:10:45,519 --> 00:10:47,360
and we found that on these websites the

278
00:10:47,360 --> 00:10:50,000
number of third parties was unchanged

279
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:52,079
which suggests that cname-based tracking

280
00:10:52,079 --> 00:10:53,920
and third-party tracking are used by

281
00:10:53,920 --> 00:10:55,839
websites on a complementary basis in

282
00:10:55,839 --> 00:10:56,800
order to achieve

283
00:10:56,800 --> 00:11:01,839
additional information about the users

284
00:11:02,640 --> 00:11:04,880
finally i will discuss the implications

285
00:11:04,880 --> 00:11:06,320
of cname-based tracking

286
00:11:06,320 --> 00:11:08,320
we found some serious privacy and

287
00:11:08,320 --> 00:11:10,399
security issues arising from the way

288
00:11:10,399 --> 00:11:14,320
that the cname scheme is set up first of

289
00:11:14,320 --> 00:11:15,440
all

290
00:11:15,440 --> 00:11:17,920
we found cookies leaking to the cnn base

291
00:11:17,920 --> 00:11:18,720
tracker

292
00:11:18,720 --> 00:11:20,560
those are cookies that were scoped to

293
00:11:20,560 --> 00:11:21,839
the domain of the website

294
00:11:21,839 --> 00:11:24,160
and we had a look at more almost 9 000

295
00:11:24,160 --> 00:11:26,399
websites using cnn base tracking and we

296
00:11:26,399 --> 00:11:27,279
found

297
00:11:27,279 --> 00:11:30,880
that cookies were leaking on on 95

298
00:11:30,880 --> 00:11:33,760
of the websites in the table below we

299
00:11:33,760 --> 00:11:35,760
can see the most common origin of the

300
00:11:35,760 --> 00:11:37,360
cookie that was linking to the cnn base

301
00:11:37,360 --> 00:11:38,000
tracker

302
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:40,800
for instance google analytics sets a

303
00:11:40,800 --> 00:11:42,959
first party tracking cookie

304
00:11:42,959 --> 00:11:46,000
on the dominant website and in

305
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:48,480
a large amount of cases this google

306
00:11:48,480 --> 00:11:50,720
analytics cookie was leaking to the cnn

307
00:11:50,720 --> 00:11:51,839
base tracker

308
00:11:51,839 --> 00:11:54,320
so these leaks are not all intentional

309
00:11:54,320 --> 00:11:56,480
but we also had a look at cookies that

310
00:11:56,480 --> 00:11:57,279
were leaking

311
00:11:57,279 --> 00:12:00,639
via request urls which could indicate

312
00:12:00,639 --> 00:12:03,279
the practice of cookie syncing which is

313
00:12:03,279 --> 00:12:04,880
also meant to bypass tracking

314
00:12:04,880 --> 00:12:06,160
protections

315
00:12:06,160 --> 00:12:08,240
we found that the number of the cookies

316
00:12:08,240 --> 00:12:09,200
were set

317
00:12:09,200 --> 00:12:11,040
by the third party domain of the tracker

318
00:12:11,040 --> 00:12:12,639
which clearly indicates

319
00:12:12,639 --> 00:12:16,480
the practice of cookie sinking

320
00:12:18,320 --> 00:12:20,079
we also had a look at whether any

321
00:12:20,079 --> 00:12:22,320
sensitive information was leaking to the

322
00:12:22,320 --> 00:12:23,600
cna based tracker

323
00:12:23,600 --> 00:12:25,519
for this we performed a manual analysis

324
00:12:25,519 --> 00:12:26,880
on 50 websites

325
00:12:26,880 --> 00:12:29,920
and on 17 after the 50 websites

326
00:12:29,920 --> 00:12:32,000
we found some sensitive information

327
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:33,360
leaking

328
00:12:33,360 --> 00:12:35,680
the full name a location an email

329
00:12:35,680 --> 00:12:36,399
address

330
00:12:36,399 --> 00:12:39,279
and in 10 cases an authentication cookie

331
00:12:39,279 --> 00:12:41,519
was leaking to the cnn base tracker

332
00:12:41,519 --> 00:12:44,399
and last one also has some serious

333
00:12:44,399 --> 00:12:45,120
security

334
00:12:45,120 --> 00:12:49,200
implications finally

335
00:12:49,200 --> 00:12:52,560
we also found a couple of issues

336
00:12:52,560 --> 00:12:54,639
security issues arising from the way

337
00:12:54,639 --> 00:12:56,240
that the cname

338
00:12:56,240 --> 00:12:59,440
based tracking scheme is set up

339
00:12:59,440 --> 00:13:02,160
because of the tracker being included in

340
00:13:02,160 --> 00:13:04,000
a first party context

341
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:07,040
to the visited website we found

342
00:13:07,040 --> 00:13:09,839
a couple of security vulnerabilities

343
00:13:09,839 --> 00:13:12,240
namely two major vulnerabilities that

344
00:13:12,240 --> 00:13:13,279
were affecting

345
00:13:13,279 --> 00:13:15,600
all of the publisher websites using this

346
00:13:15,600 --> 00:13:18,000
tracker

347
00:13:18,160 --> 00:13:20,880
to sum up our study on cname-based

348
00:13:20,880 --> 00:13:21,680
tracking

349
00:13:21,680 --> 00:13:24,240
our methodology allowed us to detect

350
00:13:24,240 --> 00:13:25,760
cname-based trackers that were

351
00:13:25,760 --> 00:13:26,560
previously

352
00:13:26,560 --> 00:13:29,519
unknown to tracker blocking tools we

353
00:13:29,519 --> 00:13:31,519
performed a large-scale evaluation

354
00:13:31,519 --> 00:13:34,639
of cname-based tracking and we found

355
00:13:34,639 --> 00:13:36,240
that the popularity of senior-based

356
00:13:36,240 --> 00:13:38,079
tracking has increased by

357
00:13:38,079 --> 00:13:41,360
21 in the last two years

358
00:13:41,360 --> 00:13:43,360
and finally we found some serious

359
00:13:43,360 --> 00:13:45,120
privacy and security issues

360
00:13:45,120 --> 00:13:47,600
that arise from the cname based tracking

361
00:13:47,600 --> 00:13:48,240
scheme

362
00:13:48,240 --> 00:13:50,240
namely we found two major web security

363
00:13:50,240 --> 00:13:52,000
flaws present on web pages

364
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:54,480
and some sensitive information leaking

365
00:13:54,480 --> 00:13:57,360
to the trackers

366
00:13:58,079 --> 00:14:02,160
thank you for your attention

367
00:14:02,160 --> 00:14:04,240
you
