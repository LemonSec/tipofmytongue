00:00:00,640 --> 00:00:04,960
hello and i am a fifth year phd student

2
00:00:04,960 --> 00:00:07,759
at the university of michigan i will

3
00:00:07,759 --> 00:00:08,639
present

4
00:00:08,639 --> 00:00:11,519
our paper automated expression and

5
00:00:11,519 --> 00:00:13,679
presentation of data practices

6
00:00:13,679 --> 00:00:16,960
in privacy process this enjoys work

7
00:00:16,960 --> 00:00:18,240
between researchers

8
00:00:18,240 --> 00:00:20,240
at the university of michigan and

9
00:00:20,240 --> 00:00:21,920
samsung research

10
00:00:21,920 --> 00:00:24,960
the last order june machine was

11
00:00:24,960 --> 00:00:27,199
affiliated with samsung research prior

12
00:00:27,199 --> 00:00:31,840
to joining crypto lab

13
00:00:32,079 --> 00:00:34,160
privacy process are difficult to

14
00:00:34,160 --> 00:00:35,520
understand

15
00:00:35,520 --> 00:00:38,559
because they are long and sophisticated

16
00:00:38,559 --> 00:00:41,840
documents written in legal language

17
00:00:41,840 --> 00:00:44,320
the figures below show the privacy

18
00:00:44,320 --> 00:00:45,360
process

19
00:00:45,360 --> 00:00:48,559
of facebook amazon and samsung

20
00:00:48,559 --> 00:00:51,280
which comprise many pages of data

21
00:00:51,280 --> 00:00:54,320
practice declaration

22
00:00:54,320 --> 00:00:56,960
researchers have found that it may take

23
00:00:56,960 --> 00:00:58,719
more than 200 hours

24
00:00:58,719 --> 00:01:01,920
for an average user just to read

25
00:01:01,920 --> 00:01:04,799
the privacy process he or she encounters

26
00:01:04,799 --> 00:01:08,000
on the web in a year

27
00:01:09,520 --> 00:01:12,080
however it is necessary to understand

28
00:01:12,080 --> 00:01:13,760
privacy policies

29
00:01:13,760 --> 00:01:16,000
because they contain statements about

30
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:16,960
correlation

31
00:01:16,960 --> 00:01:18,880
or sharing of sensitive personal

32
00:01:18,880 --> 00:01:21,040
information

33
00:01:21,040 --> 00:01:23,840
for example js bank may collect all

34
00:01:23,840 --> 00:01:25,520
sorts of personal information

35
00:01:25,520 --> 00:01:28,560
ranging from names email addresses

36
00:01:28,560 --> 00:01:32,079
mainly addresses social security numbers

37
00:01:32,079 --> 00:01:40,320
and driver's license numbers

38
00:01:40,320 --> 00:01:43,600
furthermore ignoring privacy process

39
00:01:43,600 --> 00:01:46,079
may lead to blind consent or

40
00:01:46,079 --> 00:01:47,680
breakthrough agreements

41
00:01:47,680 --> 00:01:51,280
and thus possess high privacy risks to

42
00:01:51,280 --> 00:01:55,759
users for example android.me

43
00:01:55,759 --> 00:01:58,880
service was found to have corrected and

44
00:01:58,880 --> 00:01:59,520
sold

45
00:01:59,520 --> 00:02:03,280
users data however the website defended

46
00:02:03,280 --> 00:02:03,920
that

47
00:02:03,920 --> 00:02:06,719
they had already stated such that the

48
00:02:06,719 --> 00:02:07,520
practices

49
00:02:07,520 --> 00:02:10,560
in the privacy process but most users

50
00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:11,760
did not take time

51
00:02:11,760 --> 00:02:15,280
to read and find them

52
00:02:17,840 --> 00:02:19,920
users want to understand privacy

53
00:02:19,920 --> 00:02:21,520
processing first

54
00:02:21,520 --> 00:02:24,319
so it would be useful for them to

55
00:02:24,319 --> 00:02:25,760
understand the types

56
00:02:25,760 --> 00:02:28,239
of their information corrected and

57
00:02:28,239 --> 00:02:29,120
shared which

58
00:02:29,120 --> 00:02:32,560
are among their main concerns the main

59
00:02:32,560 --> 00:02:33,519
obstacle for

60
00:02:33,519 --> 00:02:36,160
users is that the privacy process are

61
00:02:36,160 --> 00:02:37,840
too long

62
00:02:37,840 --> 00:02:41,200
so our approach is to create automated

63
00:02:41,200 --> 00:02:42,080
techniques

64
00:02:42,080 --> 00:02:44,080
that extract and present relevant

65
00:02:44,080 --> 00:02:45,200
information

66
00:02:45,200 --> 00:02:49,200
to users to have them understand privacy

67
00:02:49,200 --> 00:02:50,080
process

68
00:02:50,080 --> 00:02:53,519
easily and fast generally

69
00:02:53,519 --> 00:02:55,599
we create an information extraction

70
00:02:55,599 --> 00:02:57,440
technique that helps

71
00:02:57,440 --> 00:03:04,159
minimize the text the users need to read

72
00:03:04,159 --> 00:03:07,440
we have two main goals the first one is

73
00:03:07,440 --> 00:03:10,159
to automatically extracted the objects

74
00:03:10,159 --> 00:03:12,879
and the actions performed their own from

75
00:03:12,879 --> 00:03:14,959
privacy process

76
00:03:14,959 --> 00:03:17,440
the second one is to present the

77
00:03:17,440 --> 00:03:18,000
extracted

78
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:22,239
information in an easy to read way

79
00:03:22,640 --> 00:03:25,200
in the following example our system

80
00:03:25,200 --> 00:03:25,840
called

81
00:03:25,840 --> 00:03:28,879
pre-extract highlights the data types

82
00:03:28,879 --> 00:03:31,200
that are collected and shared in the

83
00:03:31,200 --> 00:03:32,239
privacy process

84
00:03:32,239 --> 00:03:34,640
in the road text to help users

85
00:03:34,640 --> 00:03:35,680
understand the

86
00:03:35,680 --> 00:03:39,440
policy documents easily

87
00:03:41,599 --> 00:03:45,200
we use for data action labels correct

88
00:03:45,200 --> 00:03:48,239
not correct share and not share

89
00:03:48,239 --> 00:03:50,720
the correct label means the data is

90
00:03:50,720 --> 00:03:51,519
corrected

91
00:03:51,519 --> 00:03:54,480
or used by the first party while the

92
00:03:54,480 --> 00:03:54,879
share

93
00:03:54,879 --> 00:03:57,840
label means the data is corrected by a

94
00:03:57,840 --> 00:04:00,720
third party

95
00:04:00,720 --> 00:04:04,560
two notators label the data objects in

96
00:04:04,560 --> 00:04:05,519
each sentence

97
00:04:05,519 --> 00:04:09,360
with the four labels to increase

98
00:04:09,360 --> 00:04:12,560
the annotation speed and quality we use

99
00:04:12,560 --> 00:04:14,319
a semi-automated process

100
00:04:14,319 --> 00:04:17,600
that has four steps pre-processing

101
00:04:17,600 --> 00:04:20,720
revision of existing class regulation

102
00:04:20,720 --> 00:04:25,919
in opp 115 automated correction

103
00:04:25,919 --> 00:04:30,960
and pre-annotation and final review

104
00:04:30,960 --> 00:04:33,759
these steps were done in sequential

105
00:04:33,759 --> 00:04:34,400
order

106
00:04:34,400 --> 00:04:37,280
for each document and the output of the

107
00:04:37,280 --> 00:04:38,720
annotation pipeline

108
00:04:38,720 --> 00:04:42,000
is a data set a privacy process with

109
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:45,280
final grade annotations

110
00:04:47,040 --> 00:04:49,600
in the first step of the pipeline we

111
00:04:49,600 --> 00:04:50,479
created

112
00:04:50,479 --> 00:04:53,520
new file reference level annotations

113
00:04:53,520 --> 00:04:55,840
based on the existing one-screen label

114
00:04:55,840 --> 00:04:56,639
text bands

115
00:04:56,639 --> 00:04:59,759
in the opp-115 dataset that was created

116
00:04:59,759 --> 00:05:02,720
by law experts

117
00:05:02,880 --> 00:05:05,280
the existing annotations created by skin

118
00:05:05,280 --> 00:05:06,000
workers

119
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:08,560
are useful to speed up the process such

120
00:05:08,560 --> 00:05:10,000
as to determine whether

121
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:12,479
a sentence contains any data correction

122
00:05:12,479 --> 00:05:16,080
or sharing practice or not

123
00:05:16,400 --> 00:05:20,240
in particular we selected and annotated

124
00:05:20,240 --> 00:05:24,720
30 documents from the 115 online privacy

125
00:05:24,720 --> 00:05:25,440
process

126
00:05:25,440 --> 00:05:29,280
in the opp 115 data set

127
00:05:29,280 --> 00:05:31,919
we resolve the conflicting annotations

128
00:05:31,919 --> 00:05:32,720
refined

129
00:05:32,720 --> 00:05:35,919
labels recover log text and identify

130
00:05:35,919 --> 00:05:37,120
additional

131
00:05:37,120 --> 00:05:39,440
data objects that the original

132
00:05:39,440 --> 00:05:42,560
annotators missed

133
00:05:43,840 --> 00:05:46,880
in the example below we will find an

134
00:05:46,880 --> 00:05:47,759
annotation

135
00:05:47,759 --> 00:05:50,960
that covers a long text plan into

136
00:05:50,960 --> 00:05:53,840
fine grained annotations that cover

137
00:05:53,840 --> 00:05:54,400
short

138
00:05:54,400 --> 00:05:58,720
phrases describing specific data types

139
00:05:58,720 --> 00:06:02,880
such as information general location

140
00:06:02,880 --> 00:06:08,400
your mobile device and unique identifier

141
00:06:11,600 --> 00:06:13,759
in the automated correction and

142
00:06:13,759 --> 00:06:15,759
pre-annotation step

143
00:06:15,759 --> 00:06:19,360
we developed a semi-automatic process

144
00:06:19,360 --> 00:06:22,639
that includes automated turns for

145
00:06:22,639 --> 00:06:25,759
correction and pre-annotation

146
00:06:25,759 --> 00:06:27,759
which are commonly used to increase the

147
00:06:27,759 --> 00:06:28,800
notation speed

148
00:06:28,800 --> 00:06:32,880
and improve the quality of copper

149
00:06:33,120 --> 00:06:35,600
the automatized corrections has two

150
00:06:35,600 --> 00:06:36,720
steps to create

151
00:06:36,720 --> 00:06:40,560
consistently labeled test space

152
00:06:40,560 --> 00:06:43,759
first the turns remove relative and

153
00:06:43,759 --> 00:06:46,160
pre-positional clauses

154
00:06:46,160 --> 00:06:49,199
and second there are line annotations

155
00:06:49,199 --> 00:06:52,080
with null channels

156
00:06:52,560 --> 00:06:55,919
in the final manual review step

157
00:06:55,919 --> 00:06:58,240
after the automatized correction and

158
00:06:58,240 --> 00:06:59,759
pre-annotation

159
00:06:59,759 --> 00:07:02,319
the annotators manually reviewed the

160
00:07:02,319 --> 00:07:06,160
automatically created annotations

161
00:07:06,160 --> 00:07:08,800
finally we have a discussion to

162
00:07:08,800 --> 00:07:09,680
reconcile

163
00:07:09,680 --> 00:07:14,840
these agreements between our labor

164
00:07:14,840 --> 00:07:17,599
process

165
00:07:17,599 --> 00:07:20,319
the resulting data set of file-rendered

166
00:07:20,319 --> 00:07:21,199
practices

167
00:07:21,199 --> 00:07:26,479
contains 30 privacy policy documents

168
00:07:26,479 --> 00:07:29,520
which comprise 4.1 000 sentences

169
00:07:29,520 --> 00:07:32,639
and ninety seven thousand tokens

170
00:07:32,639 --> 00:07:35,599
we annotated two point six thousand five

171
00:07:35,599 --> 00:07:37,520
credit apprentices

172
00:07:37,520 --> 00:07:39,520
while the internal data agreement

173
00:07:39,520 --> 00:07:41,280
achieves more than ninety

174
00:07:41,280 --> 00:07:44,800
eight percent at one score

175
00:07:44,800 --> 00:07:47,199
the statistics of the data set are shown

176
00:07:47,199 --> 00:07:50,240
in the table below

177
00:07:50,560 --> 00:07:52,879
the correct and shared labels have the

178
00:07:52,879 --> 00:07:55,199
largest number of instances

179
00:07:55,199 --> 00:07:57,120
while the not correct and not shared

180
00:07:57,120 --> 00:07:59,039
labels has the least

181
00:07:59,039 --> 00:08:02,159
number of indices

182
00:08:04,479 --> 00:08:06,400
we then split the whole data set in the

183
00:08:06,400 --> 00:08:09,280
trending and validation sets

184
00:08:09,280 --> 00:08:13,039
the trendy set contains 23 documents

185
00:08:13,039 --> 00:08:17,120
or 3035 sentences

186
00:08:17,120 --> 00:08:19,599
whereas the validation set contains

187
00:08:19,599 --> 00:08:20,960
seven documents

188
00:08:20,960 --> 00:08:27,840
or 1029 sentences

189
00:08:28,160 --> 00:08:31,360
we experimented the following models for

190
00:08:31,360 --> 00:08:32,958
extracting data practices

191
00:08:32,958 --> 00:08:36,159
from privacy process the first model is

192
00:08:36,159 --> 00:08:36,479
called

193
00:08:36,479 --> 00:08:39,599
ruby extraction or rbe

194
00:08:39,599 --> 00:08:42,159
it is based on policy linked a

195
00:08:42,159 --> 00:08:44,080
state-of-the-art privacy process

196
00:08:44,080 --> 00:08:46,800
analysis technique

197
00:08:46,800 --> 00:08:49,760
on the other hand ph strike uses a

198
00:08:49,760 --> 00:08:51,040
neural border

199
00:08:51,040 --> 00:08:53,200
based on the directional long short-term

200
00:08:53,200 --> 00:08:55,839
memory convolutional neural network

201
00:08:55,839 --> 00:08:59,360
and conditional random fret or

202
00:08:59,360 --> 00:09:03,680
vrsdn cnn serif for short

203
00:09:04,080 --> 00:09:07,440
it uses one layer of 100 dimensional

204
00:09:07,440 --> 00:09:10,640
multi-directional rsdn and we

205
00:09:10,640 --> 00:09:13,200
experimented two world embeddings

206
00:09:13,200 --> 00:09:15,360
configurations

207
00:09:15,360 --> 00:09:19,440
the first one is 300 dimensional growth

208
00:09:19,440 --> 00:09:21,360
for embeddings

209
00:09:21,360 --> 00:09:25,600
and the second one is 1024

210
00:09:25,600 --> 00:09:29,120
dimensional transsexualized birth last

211
00:09:29,120 --> 00:09:32,240
case whereby things

212
00:09:33,519 --> 00:09:36,160
the evaluation results showed that peer

213
00:09:36,160 --> 00:09:37,360
extractor performs

214
00:09:37,360 --> 00:09:41,360
rule by extraction technique or ibe

215
00:09:41,360 --> 00:09:44,240
the performance scores of the models on

216
00:09:44,240 --> 00:09:44,880
the four

217
00:09:44,880 --> 00:09:48,959
dedication levels are shown below

218
00:09:49,120 --> 00:09:53,600
strike achieves 64.14

219
00:09:53,600 --> 00:09:56,000
everyone's score over which is

220
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:59,240
significantly higher than

221
00:09:59,240 --> 00:10:01,440
41.81 percent

222
00:10:01,440 --> 00:10:07,279
reference score of the rbe configuration

223
00:10:07,360 --> 00:10:10,959
furthermore the bird base motor achieves

224
00:10:10,959 --> 00:10:13,680
much higher effort score compared to the

225
00:10:13,680 --> 00:10:19,839
motor based on the rough four embeddings

226
00:10:20,240 --> 00:10:24,320
we hypothesized that the low f1 scores

227
00:10:24,320 --> 00:10:25,200
of the motors

228
00:10:25,200 --> 00:10:27,760
were due to the limitation of the name

229
00:10:27,760 --> 00:10:29,120
entity recognition

230
00:10:29,120 --> 00:10:31,760
or nerve motor which were designed to

231
00:10:31,760 --> 00:10:33,200
extract context-free

232
00:10:33,200 --> 00:10:35,880
name entities rather than

233
00:10:35,880 --> 00:10:37,040
context-dependent

234
00:10:37,040 --> 00:10:40,160
data objects and practices

235
00:10:40,160 --> 00:10:43,440
therefore we test the performance of

236
00:10:43,440 --> 00:10:46,000
neural models to extract free data

237
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:46,640
objects

238
00:10:46,640 --> 00:10:50,000
without the data actions

239
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:53,200
we derive a set of data object entities

240
00:10:53,200 --> 00:10:56,000
by merging all of the data action labels

241
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:57,279
into a single

242
00:10:57,279 --> 00:11:04,440
data label this dataset had 1737 census

243
00:11:04,440 --> 00:11:07,200
55.3 000 tokens

244
00:11:07,200 --> 00:11:12,079
and 1736 entities

245
00:11:12,079 --> 00:11:15,440
the corpus was then split into a

246
00:11:15,440 --> 00:11:16,399
training set

247
00:11:16,399 --> 00:11:20,000
and that's it on the desert

248
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:23,120
the bird-based neural motor achieved

249
00:11:23,120 --> 00:11:26,720
an f1 score of 80 percent or 79

250
00:11:26,720 --> 00:11:30,480
precision and 81 record

251
00:11:30,480 --> 00:11:32,360
this result provides surprise that

252
00:11:32,360 --> 00:11:34,480
context-free data objects can be

253
00:11:34,480 --> 00:11:36,320
extracted with high accuracy

254
00:11:36,320 --> 00:11:39,680
by the numerals and the consistencies of

255
00:11:39,680 --> 00:11:42,959
the annotations on data objects in our

256
00:11:42,959 --> 00:11:45,359
corpus

257
00:11:46,800 --> 00:11:50,399
we propose a presentation method called

258
00:11:50,399 --> 00:11:53,600
better practice annotation to highlight

259
00:11:53,600 --> 00:11:55,839
and describe the data practices

260
00:11:55,839 --> 00:11:57,920
extracted by pair extract

261
00:11:57,920 --> 00:12:00,800
in order to enhance users understanding

262
00:12:00,800 --> 00:12:03,200
of privacy process

263
00:12:03,200 --> 00:12:06,320
so from the predictions by extract the

264
00:12:06,320 --> 00:12:09,040
personal data objects are highlighted

265
00:12:09,040 --> 00:12:11,440
and the actions performed on the data

266
00:12:11,440 --> 00:12:12,079
objects

267
00:12:12,079 --> 00:12:16,240
are described as text annotations

268
00:12:16,240 --> 00:12:19,200
say specifically the data action labels

269
00:12:19,200 --> 00:12:20,480
are displayed on top

270
00:12:20,480 --> 00:12:22,639
of the highlighted phrases so that they

271
00:12:22,639 --> 00:12:24,800
do not hinder the reading flow of the

272
00:12:24,800 --> 00:12:28,639
users on the privacy text

273
00:12:28,800 --> 00:12:30,720
and the background colors of the text

274
00:12:30,720 --> 00:12:31,839
and labels

275
00:12:31,839 --> 00:12:38,399
are different for each level

276
00:12:38,399 --> 00:12:41,440
we conducted a user study to evaluate

277
00:12:41,440 --> 00:12:45,040
the effects of the presentation on user

278
00:12:45,040 --> 00:12:47,519
reading comprehension

279
00:12:47,519 --> 00:12:50,639
we experiment three configurations plain

280
00:12:50,639 --> 00:12:51,600
text

281
00:12:51,600 --> 00:12:54,320
data practice annotation or dpi for

282
00:12:54,320 --> 00:12:55,040
short

283
00:12:55,040 --> 00:12:58,399
and dpi error which is dpi with

284
00:12:58,399 --> 00:13:02,000
erroneous annotations the dpi

285
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:05,680
error is used to study the impact

286
00:13:05,680 --> 00:13:08,639
predictions of pa straight to user's

287
00:13:08,639 --> 00:13:10,800
computation

288
00:13:10,800 --> 00:13:14,560
we hired 150 cross-source workers from

289
00:13:14,560 --> 00:13:17,760
amazon mtark and used four results

290
00:13:17,760 --> 00:13:21,200
of privacy process

291
00:13:21,200 --> 00:13:24,240
the resource questions we attend answers

292
00:13:24,240 --> 00:13:28,720
are first if correct data practice

293
00:13:28,720 --> 00:13:29,839
foundations

294
00:13:29,839 --> 00:13:32,399
are presented do users understand

295
00:13:32,399 --> 00:13:34,880
privacy process takes better

296
00:13:34,880 --> 00:13:39,920
as indicated by a higher total score

297
00:13:40,079 --> 00:13:43,760
second if erroneous that the practice

298
00:13:43,760 --> 00:13:44,639
annotations

299
00:13:44,639 --> 00:13:47,920
are presented do users have work

300
00:13:47,920 --> 00:13:50,480
comprehension

301
00:13:50,480 --> 00:13:53,440
and the third is that the practice

302
00:13:53,440 --> 00:13:54,320
annotations

303
00:13:54,320 --> 00:13:56,399
which are either correct or incorrect

304
00:13:56,399 --> 00:13:57,600
are presented

305
00:13:57,600 --> 00:14:00,720
do users need less effort to read the

306
00:14:00,720 --> 00:14:02,240
policy excerpts

307
00:14:02,240 --> 00:14:06,880
as indicated by shorter answering time

308
00:14:09,120 --> 00:14:12,160
our experimental results show that the

309
00:14:12,160 --> 00:14:13,839
practice annotation

310
00:14:13,839 --> 00:14:16,639
significantly improves the means total

311
00:14:16,639 --> 00:14:17,440
score

312
00:14:17,440 --> 00:14:20,639
over the play test configuration

313
00:14:20,639 --> 00:14:22,800
the average score of the plaintext

314
00:14:22,800 --> 00:14:23,680
version

315
00:14:23,680 --> 00:14:27,199
is 3.69

316
00:14:27,199 --> 00:14:29,440
while the average score of the dpa

317
00:14:29,440 --> 00:14:31,160
version is

318
00:14:31,160 --> 00:14:34,959
4.67 which is 26.6

319
00:14:34,959 --> 00:14:38,160
higher than the plaintext version

320
00:14:38,160 --> 00:14:40,079
in the figure below the error bars

321
00:14:40,079 --> 00:14:41,279
represent

322
00:14:41,279 --> 00:14:45,519
95 confidence in the intervals

323
00:14:47,519 --> 00:14:50,639
on the other hand ground annotations

324
00:14:50,639 --> 00:14:53,760
or the dpi error version significantly

325
00:14:53,760 --> 00:14:54,399
reduce

326
00:14:54,399 --> 00:14:57,760
the user's comprehension the average

327
00:14:57,760 --> 00:15:00,079
total score were reduced by

328
00:15:00,079 --> 00:15:03,199
15 by 43 percent

329
00:15:03,199 --> 00:15:06,320
compared to the plane configuration

330
00:15:06,320 --> 00:15:10,279
from the 3.69 to

331
00:15:10,279 --> 00:15:14,240
3.12 every score

332
00:15:16,079 --> 00:15:19,279
to identify the causes of the negative

333
00:15:19,279 --> 00:15:19,920
effects

334
00:15:19,920 --> 00:15:23,600
of incorrect notation we further analyze

335
00:15:23,600 --> 00:15:24,320
the effects

336
00:15:24,320 --> 00:15:28,320
of dpa error when the annotations

337
00:15:28,320 --> 00:15:31,120
were either omitted or contained an

338
00:15:31,120 --> 00:15:34,240
incorrect data action level

339
00:15:34,240 --> 00:15:36,639
the results show that the effect of

340
00:15:36,639 --> 00:15:38,160
omission and greatness

341
00:15:38,160 --> 00:15:41,199
is significant with p value

342
00:15:41,199 --> 00:15:45,519
less than 0.001

343
00:15:45,519 --> 00:15:47,519
but the effect of increasing labor

344
00:15:47,519 --> 00:15:48,560
relations

345
00:15:48,560 --> 00:15:52,240
is not significant with a p-value

346
00:15:52,240 --> 00:15:56,240
of 0.68

347
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:01,120
further analysis shows that annotations

348
00:16:01,120 --> 00:16:04,000
do not significantly reduce the effort

349

of reading the policy text as indicated

350
00:16:07,440 --> 00:16:09,839
by the shorter average total answering

351
00:16:09,839 --> 00:16:10,880
time

352
00:16:10,880 --> 00:16:13,199
the difference of average total

among the three configurations is not

355
00:16:16,920 --> 00:16:18,720
statistically significant

356
00:16:18,720 --> 00:16:23,079
with a p-value of only

357
00:16:23,079 --> 00:16:25,519
0.66

358
00:16:25,519 --> 00:16:28,399
the dpa configuration slightly reduces

359
00:16:28,399 --> 00:16:30,320
the average total answering time

360
00:16:30,320 --> 00:16:35,279
of the plane version by 17.11

361
00:16:35,279 --> 00:16:37,839
but the difference of the answering time

362
00:16:37,839 --> 00:16:39,839
between the dpi error

363
00:16:39,839 --> 00:16:42,880
and blend configurations is not

364
00:16:42,880 --> 00:16:45,600
significant

365
00:16:48,959 --> 00:16:52,160
qualitative evaluation shows that a

366
00:16:52,160 --> 00:16:53,040
majority

367
00:16:53,040 --> 00:16:56,959
of the participants with annotated

368
00:16:56,959 --> 00:17:00,800
versions both dpi and dp air versus

369
00:17:00,800 --> 00:17:06,199
found that the visual ad is referring

370
00:17:06,199 --> 00:17:09,199
64.2 of them considered

371
00:17:09,199 --> 00:17:11,679
the highlighted text very or extremely

372
00:17:11,679 --> 00:17:12,799
helpful

373
00:17:12,799 --> 00:17:15,839
while only 9.2 percent considered the

374
00:17:15,839 --> 00:17:16,880
annotations

375
00:17:16,880 --> 00:17:20,640
provided no or slight help

376
00:17:24,160 --> 00:17:27,520
in conclusion we constructed a large

377
00:17:27,520 --> 00:17:30,559
and fine-grained set of data objects

378
00:17:30,559 --> 00:17:33,919
and data actions in privacy process

379
00:17:33,919 --> 00:17:36,960
we developed ph straight to extract

380
00:17:36,960 --> 00:17:39,679
and present data objects and actions

381
00:17:39,679 --> 00:17:41,600
that the practice adaptations

382
00:17:41,600 --> 00:17:45,200
on policies text

383
00:17:45,200 --> 00:17:48,000
pianistry outperforms a state-of-the-art

384
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:49,840
rule-based technique

385
00:17:49,840 --> 00:17:52,400
and is that the practice presentation

386
00:17:52,400 --> 00:17:54,480
significantly improves

387
00:17:54,480 --> 00:17:58,840
the user comprehension of privacy

388
00:17:58,840 --> 00:18:01,840
process

389
00:18:02,960 --> 00:18:05,600
thank you very much for your attention i

390
00:18:05,600 --> 00:18:07,360
will be happy to answer

391
