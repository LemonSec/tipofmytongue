hello i'm peter storey

2
00:00:03,040 --> 00:00:05,040
today i'll be presenting our paper

3
00:00:05,040 --> 00:00:07,759
awareness adoption and misconceptions of

4
00:00:07,759 --> 00:00:09,679
web privacy tools

5
00:00:09,679 --> 00:00:11,920
this work was a collaboration between

6
00:00:11,920 --> 00:00:13,519
carnegie mellon university

7
00:00:13,519 --> 00:00:15,120
and the school of information at

8
00:00:15,120 --> 00:00:18,160
university of michigan

9
00:00:18,960 --> 00:00:20,800
americans say that they want digital

10
00:00:20,800 --> 00:00:22,640
privacy but in fact

11
00:00:22,640 --> 00:00:24,640
adoption of many privacy tools remains

12
00:00:24,640 --> 00:00:27,039
low but helping people adopt effective

13
00:00:27,039 --> 00:00:27,840
tools

14
00:00:27,840 --> 00:00:29,199
might alleviate some of people's

15
00:00:29,199 --> 00:00:32,079
concerns but before we can do that

16
00:00:32,079 --> 00:00:33,520
it's important to understand any

17
00:00:33,520 --> 00:00:35,360
barriers to adoption

18
00:00:35,360 --> 00:00:37,120
and to understand what misconceptions

19
00:00:37,120 --> 00:00:38,879
people have about tools

20
00:00:38,879 --> 00:00:40,800
since misconceptions might lead people

21
00:00:40,800 --> 00:00:44,160
to misuse them

22
00:00:44,160 --> 00:00:45,879
in our study we looked at five

23
00:00:45,879 --> 00:00:48,000
privacy-centric browsing tools

24
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:49,120
that have been discussed in the

25
00:00:49,120 --> 00:00:51,760
literature we looked at private browsing

26
00:00:51,760 --> 00:00:54,960
vpns tour browser ad blockers

27
00:00:54,960 --> 00:00:57,840
and antivirus software now antivirus

28
00:00:57,840 --> 00:00:59,680
software is more of a security tool than

29
00:00:59,680 --> 00:01:00,800
a privacy tool

30
00:01:00,800 --> 00:01:02,320
but we included it because we were

31
00:01:02,320 --> 00:01:03,920
interested in whether people would

32
00:01:03,920 --> 00:01:07,760
describe privacy protections to it

33
00:01:08,320 --> 00:01:10,560
we wanted to study the extent to which

34
00:01:10,560 --> 00:01:12,000
people are aware of these tools

35
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:14,720
and how frequently people use them how

36
00:01:14,720 --> 00:01:16,400
interested people are in preventing

37
00:01:16,400 --> 00:01:19,600
specific privacy and security threats

38
00:01:19,600 --> 00:01:21,680
how accurately people can determine

39
00:01:21,680 --> 00:01:23,920
whether these tools afford protection

40
00:01:23,920 --> 00:01:26,000
from specific privacy and security

41
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:27,360
threats

42
00:01:27,360 --> 00:01:30,400
and what misconceptions if any people

43
00:01:30,400 --> 00:01:32,560
have about these tools

44
00:01:32,560 --> 00:01:34,320
now different than prior work we

45
00:01:34,320 --> 00:01:36,079
measured misconceptions across different

46
00:01:36,079 --> 00:01:37,920
combinations of tools and privacy

47
00:01:37,920 --> 00:01:38,960
threats

48
00:01:38,960 --> 00:01:40,640
and that data allowed us to identify

49
00:01:40,640 --> 00:01:42,560
patterns across tools and threats

50
00:01:42,560 --> 00:01:44,159
and to quantify the prevalence of

51
00:01:44,159 --> 00:01:47,680
different kinds and misconceptions

52
00:01:48,079 --> 00:01:49,759
we asked participants how effective they

53
00:01:49,759 --> 00:01:51,119
thought each tool would be

54
00:01:51,119 --> 00:01:53,520
at preventing different privacy threats

55
00:01:53,520 --> 00:01:55,680
here's an example

56
00:01:55,680 --> 00:01:57,600
we asked when you browse the web how

57
00:01:57,600 --> 00:01:59,600
effective are the tools at

58
00:01:59,600 --> 00:02:01,439
preventing the websites you visit from

59
00:02:01,439 --> 00:02:02,960
seeing what physical location you're

60
00:02:02,960 --> 00:02:04,560
browsing from

61
00:02:04,560 --> 00:02:06,399
preventing hackers from gaining access

62
00:02:06,399 --> 00:02:08,239
to your device

63
00:02:08,239 --> 00:02:11,280
and about 10 other scenarios for 12

64
00:02:11,280 --> 00:02:14,879
privacy threat scenarios total

65
00:02:14,879 --> 00:02:16,720
we asked each participant about six

66
00:02:16,720 --> 00:02:18,959
threats randomly selected from the 12th

67
00:02:18,959 --> 00:02:19,520
total

68
00:02:19,520 --> 00:02:22,720
to reduce fatigue

69
00:02:22,720 --> 00:02:25,599
we ran our study using an online survey

70
00:02:25,599 --> 00:02:27,440
and our survey included questions

71
00:02:27,440 --> 00:02:29,120
about whether people had heard of or

72
00:02:29,120 --> 00:02:31,200
used the five tools

73
00:02:31,200 --> 00:02:33,120
about the what people thought the

74
00:02:33,120 --> 00:02:35,120
efficacy of the tools was preventing six

75
00:02:35,120 --> 00:02:36,640
different threats

76
00:02:36,640 --> 00:02:38,400
their interest in preventing those

77
00:02:38,400 --> 00:02:41,040
threats and a free text response about

78
00:02:41,040 --> 00:02:42,879
one randomly selected tool for each

79
00:02:42,879 --> 00:02:43,840
threat

80
00:02:43,840 --> 00:02:46,080
asking people to explain why they

81
00:02:46,080 --> 00:02:49,599
described the efficacy the way they did

82
00:02:49,599 --> 00:02:51,519
we gathered our data using the prolific

83
00:02:51,519 --> 00:02:53,599
crowdsourcing platform

84
00:02:53,599 --> 00:02:55,440
and we used prolific's demographically

85
00:02:55,440 --> 00:02:57,120
stratified sample feature

86
00:02:57,120 --> 00:02:59,519
to collect a sample of u.s participants

87
00:02:59,519 --> 00:03:00,159
that

88
00:03:00,159 --> 00:03:02,720
was representative of the u.s census

89
00:03:02,720 --> 00:03:03,680
based on age

90
00:03:03,680 --> 00:03:07,599
sex and ethnicity we gathered data from

91
00:03:07,599 --> 00:03:09,440
500 participants

92
00:03:09,440 --> 00:03:13,840
and we collected data in august of 2020

93
00:03:14,959 --> 00:03:16,640
we measured participants awareness of

94
00:03:16,640 --> 00:03:18,959
the five privacy tools in our study

95
00:03:18,959 --> 00:03:21,760
we also included a fake tool privacy dog

96
00:03:21,760 --> 00:03:24,400
to gauge participants honesty

97
00:03:24,400 --> 00:03:26,000
only three percent of our participants

98
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:28,239
said they'd heard of or used privacy dog

99
00:03:28,239 --> 00:03:29,760
which gave us high confidence in the

100
00:03:29,760 --> 00:03:32,640
numbers for the other tools

101
00:03:32,640 --> 00:03:34,080
we found that more than three quarters

102
00:03:34,080 --> 00:03:36,720
of participants had heard of or used

103
00:03:36,720 --> 00:03:38,879
antivirus software ad blockers private

104
00:03:38,879 --> 00:03:41,040
browsing or vpns

105
00:03:41,040 --> 00:03:42,640
but less than half of participants

106
00:03:42,640 --> 00:03:44,799
reported having heard of or used tor

107
00:03:44,799 --> 00:03:45,760
browser

108
00:03:45,760 --> 00:03:47,440
and this suggests an opportunity to

109
00:03:47,440 --> 00:03:49,120
increase the public's awareness of tor

110
00:03:49,120 --> 00:03:51,519
browser

111
00:03:52,080 --> 00:03:53,519
we found that some of the tools we

112
00:03:53,519 --> 00:03:55,519
studied are already widely used

113
00:03:55,519 --> 00:03:58,000
like antivirus software and ad blockers

114
00:03:58,000 --> 00:03:59,439
which about half of participants

115
00:03:59,439 --> 00:04:01,120
reported using the same day they took

116
00:04:01,120 --> 00:04:02,400
our survey

117
00:04:02,400 --> 00:04:04,640
but other tools are used less frequently

118
00:04:04,640 --> 00:04:06,239
particularly tor browser

119
00:04:06,239 --> 00:04:07,439
which less than one percent of

120
00:04:07,439 --> 00:04:09,200
participants reported using the day they

121
00:04:09,200 --> 00:04:11,439
took our survey

122
00:04:11,439 --> 00:04:13,280
overall we observed that about sixty

123
00:04:13,280 --> 00:04:14,560
percent of participants

124
00:04:14,560 --> 00:04:16,238
had used at least one of the privacy

125
00:04:16,238 --> 00:04:18,238
focused tools in the past day

126
00:04:18,238 --> 00:04:19,839
and by that i mean a tool other than

127
00:04:19,839 --> 00:04:22,240
antivirus software

128
00:04:22,240 --> 00:04:24,479
nearly three quarters had used at least

129
00:04:24,479 --> 00:04:26,479
one of the privacy focused tools in the

130
00:04:26,479 --> 00:04:28,720
past week this shows that

131
00:04:28,720 --> 00:04:30,479
many people are taking steps to protect

132
00:04:30,479 --> 00:04:31,919
their privacy

133
00:04:31,919 --> 00:04:34,320
but as i'll discuss in a few slides many

134
00:04:34,320 --> 00:04:36,000
participants have misconceptions about

135
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:36,880
the protections

136
00:04:36,880 --> 00:04:40,479
offered by the tools they're using

137
00:04:41,600 --> 00:04:43,440
we asked each participant about six

138
00:04:43,440 --> 00:04:44,800
privacy threats

139
00:04:44,800 --> 00:04:46,960
randomly selected from the twelfth total

140
00:04:46,960 --> 00:04:48,560
shown here

141
00:04:48,560 --> 00:04:50,400
in addition to asking how effective each

142
00:04:50,400 --> 00:04:52,400
tool would be protecting from the threat

143
00:04:52,400 --> 00:04:54,479
we also asked how interested the

144
00:04:54,479 --> 00:04:57,440
participant was in preventing the threat

145
00:04:57,440 --> 00:04:59,360
for all threats we see that over half of

146
00:04:59,360 --> 00:05:01,600
participants expressed some interest in

147
00:05:01,600 --> 00:05:02,800
preventing it

148
00:05:02,800 --> 00:05:04,560
but people's level of interest varied

149
00:05:04,560 --> 00:05:07,199
considerably by threat

150
00:05:07,199 --> 00:05:09,440
the two most security focused threats

151
00:05:09,440 --> 00:05:11,120
about hackers and card fraud

152
00:05:11,120 --> 00:05:12,320
were of greatest interest to

153
00:05:12,320 --> 00:05:15,120
participants we also saw a strong

154
00:05:15,120 --> 00:05:16,400
interest in preventing the two

155
00:05:16,400 --> 00:05:19,919
advertiser related threats participants

156
00:05:19,919 --> 00:05:21,199
were the least interested

157
00:05:21,199 --> 00:05:25,840
in hiding illegal streaming of movies

158
00:05:26,800 --> 00:05:28,240
now the most interesting type of

159
00:05:28,240 --> 00:05:30,000
question we asked was about what

160
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:31,600
protections participants thought the

161
00:05:31,600 --> 00:05:33,120
different tools offered

162
00:05:33,120 --> 00:05:34,880
if someone thinks the tool protects them

163
00:05:34,880 --> 00:05:36,400
and it doesn't they might expose

164
00:05:36,400 --> 00:05:38,639
themselves to unnecessary risks

165
00:05:38,639 --> 00:05:40,080
and conversely if someone thinks the

166
00:05:40,080 --> 00:05:41,759
tool doesn't provide a prediction

167
00:05:41,759 --> 00:05:43,600
that actually can they'll probably be

168
00:05:43,600 --> 00:05:46,320
less motivated to use that tool

169
00:05:46,320 --> 00:05:47,600
here's an example of one of the

170
00:05:47,600 --> 00:05:49,680
questions we asked about one of the 12

171
00:05:49,680 --> 00:05:51,199
privacy threats

172
00:05:51,199 --> 00:05:53,360
we asked when you browse the web how

173
00:05:53,360 --> 00:05:55,120
effective are the tools below preventing

174
00:05:55,120 --> 00:05:56,479
the websites you visit

175
00:05:56,479 --> 00:05:58,000
from seeing what physical location

176
00:05:58,000 --> 00:05:59,759
you're browsing from

177
00:05:59,759 --> 00:06:01,199
participants could indicate that the

178
00:06:01,199 --> 00:06:03,840
tool would be very somewhat or not at

179
00:06:03,840 --> 00:06:04,639
all effective

180
00:06:04,639 --> 00:06:07,840
or that they were unsure now for this

181
00:06:07,840 --> 00:06:08,639
scenario

182
00:06:08,639 --> 00:06:10,160
websites can infer your physical

183
00:06:10,160 --> 00:06:12,479
location based on your ip address

184
00:06:12,479 --> 00:06:15,039
so of these tools only vpns and tor

185
00:06:15,039 --> 00:06:17,039
browser can hide your ip address

186
00:06:17,039 --> 00:06:18,800
so we consider them very effective at

187
00:06:18,800 --> 00:06:20,560
protecting against this threat

188
00:06:20,560 --> 00:06:23,759
and the other tools not at all effective

189
00:06:23,759 --> 00:06:25,440
the correct responses are indicated with

190
00:06:25,440 --> 00:06:27,039
a star in the graph

191
00:06:27,039 --> 00:06:28,479
now notice that we allow slight

192
00:06:28,479 --> 00:06:30,720
underestimates of tools efficacy

193
00:06:30,720 --> 00:06:32,800
since if the tools misused will provide

194
00:06:32,800 --> 00:06:34,479
less protection

195
00:06:34,479 --> 00:06:37,039
so say for vpns we allow someone to

196
00:06:37,039 --> 00:06:38,319
indicate that it's either vary or

197
00:06:38,319 --> 00:06:39,520
somewhat effective

198
00:06:39,520 --> 00:06:43,120
in this scenario now more details about

199
00:06:43,120 --> 00:06:45,120
this and our other threat scenarios

200
00:06:45,120 --> 00:06:47,759
can be found in our paper so looking at

201
00:06:47,759 --> 00:06:48,720
this graph

202
00:06:48,720 --> 00:06:50,720
going from left to right we see that

203
00:06:50,720 --> 00:06:52,319
people did pretty good

204
00:06:52,319 --> 00:06:54,000
at identifying the protections offered

205
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:55,520
by vpns

206
00:06:55,520 --> 00:06:57,360
and they also did okay for antivirus

207
00:06:57,360 --> 00:06:59,440
software and ad blockers

208
00:06:59,440 --> 00:07:01,599
but when we get to tor browser only

209
00:07:01,599 --> 00:07:03,199
about a third are correct

210
00:07:03,199 --> 00:07:06,240
and there's many unsure responses and

211
00:07:06,240 --> 00:07:08,080
perhaps most concerning we see that for

212
00:07:08,080 --> 00:07:09,199
private browsing

213
00:07:09,199 --> 00:07:11,759
more than a third are incorrect thinking

214
00:07:11,759 --> 00:07:13,280
that private browsing

215
00:07:13,280 --> 00:07:16,960
is hiding one's physical location

216
00:07:16,960 --> 00:07:19,039
and this is a misconception that has

217
00:07:19,039 --> 00:07:22,479
also been found by prior work

218
00:07:23,280 --> 00:07:24,800
now although the threat scenario in the

219
00:07:24,800 --> 00:07:26,880
last slide showed people answering quite

220
00:07:26,880 --> 00:07:28,080
well for vpns

221
00:07:28,080 --> 00:07:29,680
that isn't true when you look across the

222
00:07:29,680 --> 00:07:31,199
12 different threats

223
00:07:31,199 --> 00:07:33,599
looking across the threat scenarios for

224
00:07:33,599 --> 00:07:35,440
all tools participants answered fewer

225
00:07:35,440 --> 00:07:36,720
than 60 percent

226
00:07:36,720 --> 00:07:40,560
of the associated questions correctly

227
00:07:41,440 --> 00:07:43,360
and when we look at all 12 threats we

228
00:07:43,360 --> 00:07:44,800
see that for all but one threat

229
00:07:44,800 --> 00:07:45,680
participants

230
00:07:45,680 --> 00:07:47,039
answered fewer than half of our

231
00:07:47,039 --> 00:07:49,440
assessment questions correctly

232
00:07:49,440 --> 00:07:51,120
in this graph the 12 threats are on the

233
00:07:51,120 --> 00:07:53,199
left and we see that people did best

234
00:07:53,199 --> 00:07:54,720
when asked about preventing

235
00:07:54,720 --> 00:07:58,000
friends or family from seeing websites

236
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:00,879
in their browser history we see people

237
00:08:00,879 --> 00:08:02,400
have the most difficulty

238
00:08:02,400 --> 00:08:04,080
answering about preventing hackers from

239
00:08:04,080 --> 00:08:06,800
getting access to their device

240
00:08:06,800 --> 00:08:09,039
so what do we make of this i think it

241
00:08:09,039 --> 00:08:10,639
shows that people are clearly not

242
00:08:10,639 --> 00:08:12,800
experts about these tools and that many

243
00:08:12,800 --> 00:08:14,160
people are uninformed or even

244
00:08:14,160 --> 00:08:15,039
misinformed

245
00:08:15,039 --> 00:08:19,199
about what these tools actually do

246
00:08:19,840 --> 00:08:22,319
now a related question is whether

247
00:08:22,319 --> 00:08:24,319
greater experience with tools

248
00:08:24,319 --> 00:08:25,680
is associated with more accurate

249
00:08:25,680 --> 00:08:28,400
understanding of their protections

250
00:08:28,400 --> 00:08:30,479
in terms of experience we measured

251
00:08:30,479 --> 00:08:32,399
whether people had used the tools

252
00:08:32,399 --> 00:08:34,399
only heard of them or if they'd never

253
00:08:34,399 --> 00:08:36,320
even heard of the tool

254
00:08:36,320 --> 00:08:38,719
now ideally people who are using the

255
00:08:38,719 --> 00:08:40,320
tools would have a greater understanding

256
00:08:40,320 --> 00:08:42,640
of what they do

257
00:08:42,640 --> 00:08:44,240
and we did find that greater levels of

258
00:08:44,240 --> 00:08:46,240
experience are associated with answering

259
00:08:46,240 --> 00:08:48,399
more questions correctly

260
00:08:48,399 --> 00:08:50,800
but for vpns in tor browser greater

261
00:08:50,800 --> 00:08:52,560
levels of experience were also

262
00:08:52,560 --> 00:08:54,240
associated with greater numbers of

263
00:08:54,240 --> 00:08:57,440
incorrect responses

264
00:08:57,519 --> 00:08:59,200
this may be due to a tendency of those

265
00:08:59,200 --> 00:09:00,800
with greater levels of experience

266
00:09:00,800 --> 00:09:04,800
to mark fewer responses as unsure

267
00:09:04,959 --> 00:09:07,120
now those with more experience were more

268
00:09:07,120 --> 00:09:09,200
willing to definitively answer questions

269
00:09:09,200 --> 00:09:10,800
but their greater experience wasn't

270
00:09:10,800 --> 00:09:12,720
necessarily associated with a more

271
00:09:12,720 --> 00:09:14,240
accurate understanding of the tools

272
00:09:14,240 --> 00:09:16,880
protections

273
00:09:17,519 --> 00:09:18,800
so at this point i've shown that

274
00:09:18,800 --> 00:09:20,640
misconceptions about these tools are

275
00:09:20,640 --> 00:09:22,160
relatively widespread

276
00:09:22,160 --> 00:09:24,240
and even people using these tools often

277
00:09:24,240 --> 00:09:27,120
hold incorrect beliefs about them

278
00:09:27,120 --> 00:09:28,800
in order to gain a richer understanding

279
00:09:28,800 --> 00:09:30,560
of people's misconceptions

280
00:09:30,560 --> 00:09:32,480
ask them to explain their answers to the

281
00:09:32,480 --> 00:09:34,320
threat related questions

282
00:09:34,320 --> 00:09:38,399
here's one example this participant

283
00:09:38,399 --> 00:09:40,720
responded that they had indicated

284
00:09:40,720 --> 00:09:42,800
private browsing would be very effective

285
00:09:42,800 --> 00:09:44,320
in preventing the websites they visit

286
00:09:44,320 --> 00:09:46,080
from seeing their physical

287
00:09:46,080 --> 00:09:48,080
location they were browsing from and

288
00:09:48,080 --> 00:09:49,920
they answered because it is called

289
00:09:49,920 --> 00:09:50,959
private browsing

290
00:09:50,959 --> 00:09:52,640
which i assume means your browsing is

291
00:09:52,640 --> 00:09:54,640
private sadly uh

292
00:09:54,640 --> 00:09:57,360
not true my collaborators and i read

293
00:09:57,360 --> 00:09:58,560
through these responses and we

294
00:09:58,560 --> 00:10:00,240
identified relevant themes

295
00:10:00,240 --> 00:10:01,519
so in the next slides i'm going to

296
00:10:01,519 --> 00:10:04,320
summarize four of those themes we have

297
00:10:04,320 --> 00:10:04,720
12

298
00:10:04,720 --> 00:10:06,959
total themes and you can read about all

299
00:10:06,959 --> 00:10:08,560
of those in our paper and i would

300
00:10:08,560 --> 00:10:10,079
encourage you to do so because they're

301
00:10:10,079 --> 00:10:13,040
all very interesting

302
00:10:14,240 --> 00:10:16,720
now across all tools and threats we saw

303
00:10:16,720 --> 00:10:18,079
participants studying true

304
00:10:18,079 --> 00:10:20,079
aspects of tool functionality when

305
00:10:20,079 --> 00:10:22,240
explaining incorrect answers

306
00:10:22,240 --> 00:10:25,680
we identified this theme 184 times

307
00:10:25,680 --> 00:10:27,279
people's responses show that they know

308
00:10:27,279 --> 00:10:28,720
something about the tools

309
00:10:28,720 --> 00:10:30,160
but their knowledge doesn't prevent them

310
00:10:30,160 --> 00:10:32,160
from reaching incorrect conclusions

311
00:10:32,160 --> 00:10:34,800
about the tool's protections this might

312
00:10:34,800 --> 00:10:35,519
be due to

313
00:10:35,519 --> 00:10:38,160
incomplete mental models about the tools

314
00:10:38,160 --> 00:10:40,560
and the threats

315
00:10:40,560 --> 00:10:43,360
here are some examples this participant

316
00:10:43,360 --> 00:10:45,839
indicated vpns would be very effective

317
00:10:45,839 --> 00:10:47,680
preventing advertisers from seeing the

318
00:10:47,680 --> 00:10:49,519
websites they visit

319
00:10:49,519 --> 00:10:52,480
because vpn's mask one's ip address now

320
00:10:52,480 --> 00:10:53,279
it's true

321
00:10:53,279 --> 00:10:55,720
vpns do mask your ip address but

322
00:10:55,720 --> 00:10:57,680
advertisers can track your browsing

323
00:10:57,680 --> 00:10:59,680
using many fingerprinting techniques

324
00:10:59,680 --> 00:11:01,680
like cookies or attributes of your

325
00:11:01,680 --> 00:11:04,000
browser so hiding your ip address is not

326
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:05,120
going to prevent

327
00:11:05,120 --> 00:11:08,160
advertiser tracking

328
00:11:08,320 --> 00:11:10,160
another participant indicated that

329
00:11:10,160 --> 00:11:12,320
private browsing would be very effective

330
00:11:12,320 --> 00:11:14,000
at preventing their employer from seeing

331
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:16,480
browsing done on their employer's wi-fi

332
00:11:16,480 --> 00:11:18,079
because private browsing does not keep

333
00:11:18,079 --> 00:11:20,560
your history true if your employer took

334
00:11:20,560 --> 00:11:21,680
your phone and looked

335
00:11:21,680 --> 00:11:23,200
at your browser history they wouldn't

336
00:11:23,200 --> 00:11:24,560
see things there if you were using

337
00:11:24,560 --> 00:11:25,839
private browsing

338
00:11:25,839 --> 00:11:27,440
but because the employer is operating

339
00:11:27,440 --> 00:11:29,200
the wi-fi network they can see

340
00:11:29,200 --> 00:11:32,959
traffic that passes through that network

341
00:11:33,680 --> 00:11:35,519
we also identified resignation as a

342
00:11:35,519 --> 00:11:37,519
theme with participants frequently

343
00:11:37,519 --> 00:11:38,959
writing that nothing could be done to

344
00:11:38,959 --> 00:11:40,399
protect against an entity

345
00:11:40,399 --> 00:11:42,000
or that the indies resources were

346
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:43,839
overwhelmingly powerful

347
00:11:43,839 --> 00:11:46,320
we saw this theme even when there were

348
00:11:46,320 --> 00:11:46,880
threats

349
00:11:46,880 --> 00:11:49,360
that have effective tools to protect

350
00:11:49,360 --> 00:11:51,839
against them

351
00:11:52,160 --> 00:11:54,399
this participant indicated that tor

352
00:11:54,399 --> 00:11:56,079
bowser would be not at all effective

353
00:11:56,079 --> 00:11:58,240
at pruning observation by the government

354
00:11:58,240 --> 00:11:59,440
because if the government

355
00:11:59,440 --> 00:12:01,120
wants to see what you're doing they'll

356
00:12:01,120 --> 00:12:02,480
see it no matter what

357
00:12:02,480 --> 00:12:04,639
and there's a grange of truth to this if

358
00:12:04,639 --> 00:12:06,480
the government is actively investigating

359
00:12:06,480 --> 00:12:06,959
you

360
00:12:06,959 --> 00:12:08,560
they may trick you into installing

361
00:12:08,560 --> 00:12:10,160
malware on your computer

362
00:12:10,160 --> 00:12:13,040
or use a exploit in tor browser to try

363
00:12:13,040 --> 00:12:15,279
to get malware on your computer

364
00:12:15,279 --> 00:12:18,240
but tor browser is most likely quite

365
00:12:18,240 --> 00:12:19,440
effective at preventing mass

366
00:12:19,440 --> 00:12:20,880
surveillance

367
00:12:20,880 --> 00:12:23,839
since it's going to disguise your

368
00:12:23,839 --> 00:12:25,600
traffic with the traffic of many other

369
00:12:25,600 --> 00:12:27,360
users

370
00:12:27,360 --> 00:12:29,200
so in this scenario we would say that

371
00:12:29,200 --> 00:12:30,959
torbaster is either very or somewhat

372
00:12:30,959 --> 00:12:31,839
effective

373
00:12:31,839 --> 00:12:33,200
at preventing observation by the

374
00:12:33,200 --> 00:12:35,680
government

375
00:12:35,920 --> 00:12:37,760
this other participant indicated that

376
00:12:37,760 --> 00:12:39,920
vpns would be not at all effective

377
00:12:39,920 --> 00:12:42,959
at preventing observation by their isp

378
00:12:42,959 --> 00:12:45,040
and they answer that because they think

379
00:12:45,040 --> 00:12:47,360
that their internet service provider can

380
00:12:47,360 --> 00:12:49,040
already see everything they do

381
00:12:49,040 --> 00:12:51,839
no matter what and here this is just

382
00:12:51,839 --> 00:12:53,519
completely incorrect because the way the

383
00:12:53,519 --> 00:12:54,720
vpn works

384
00:12:54,720 --> 00:12:56,720
is by encrypting the traffic as it

385
00:12:56,720 --> 00:12:58,399
passes through the

386
00:12:58,399 --> 00:13:02,480
isp's network and then the traffic is

387
00:13:02,480 --> 00:13:04,639
the vpn's protection ends at the vpn

388
00:13:04,639 --> 00:13:06,079
endpoint so unless

389
00:13:06,079 --> 00:13:09,120
the isp is also operating the vpn

390
00:13:09,120 --> 00:13:11,920
you will hide your browsing from your

391
00:13:11,920 --> 00:13:15,120
internet service provider

392
00:13:15,440 --> 00:13:17,440
we also saw participants expressing

393
00:13:17,440 --> 00:13:19,680
overconfidence in tools protections

394
00:13:19,680 --> 00:13:21,360
writing that tools would provide total

395
00:13:21,360 --> 00:13:22,959
protection or anonymity

396
00:13:22,959 --> 00:13:25,839
even though they don't

397
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:28,079
one participant indicated that antivirus

398
00:13:28,079 --> 00:13:29,920
software would be very effective at

399
00:13:29,920 --> 00:13:31,519
preventing hackers from getting access

400
00:13:31,519 --> 00:13:32,880
to their device

401
00:13:32,880 --> 00:13:34,880
because it helped prevent any form of

402
00:13:34,880 --> 00:13:36,959
virus which might come and affect my

403
00:13:36,959 --> 00:13:38,079
data

404
00:13:38,079 --> 00:13:39,920
now i wish antivera software could do

405
00:13:39,920 --> 00:13:41,519
this but it simply can't

406
00:13:41,519 --> 00:13:44,000
so if someone is creating malware

407
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:45,360
they're going to test it against the

408
00:13:45,360 --> 00:13:47,760
most popular kinds of antivirus software

409
00:13:47,760 --> 00:13:49,120
they're only going to pay to distribute

410
00:13:49,120 --> 00:13:51,199
their malware if it isn't detected by

411
00:13:51,199 --> 00:13:55,120
most common antivirus software

412
00:13:56,720 --> 00:13:59,519
so this other participant wrote that ad

413
00:13:59,519 --> 00:14:01,199
blockers would be somewhat effective

414
00:14:01,199 --> 00:14:03,120
at preventing the websites they visit

415
00:14:03,120 --> 00:14:05,199
from seeing their physical location

416
00:14:05,199 --> 00:14:07,600
because ad blockers will shield you from

417
00:14:07,600 --> 00:14:10,079
getting your information harvested

418
00:14:10,079 --> 00:14:12,320
now this is just completely untrue

419
00:14:12,320 --> 00:14:13,279
because

420
00:14:13,279 --> 00:14:15,120
ad blockers are not going to hide your

421
00:14:15,120 --> 00:14:16,880
ip address from the website you're

422
00:14:16,880 --> 00:14:18,320
loading

423
00:14:18,320 --> 00:14:19,839
that's sort of the way you load the

424
00:14:19,839 --> 00:14:21,440
website is by

425
00:14:21,440 --> 00:14:23,839
it's sending the data to your ip address

426
00:14:23,839 --> 00:14:24,480
so

427
00:14:24,480 --> 00:14:26,320
unfortunately this is not a protection

428
00:14:26,320 --> 00:14:30,480
ad blockers can provide

429
00:14:30,480 --> 00:14:32,560
and for the last theme i'll talk about

430
00:14:32,560 --> 00:14:34,079
today

431
00:14:34,079 --> 00:14:36,079
this is relevant to the two security

432
00:14:36,079 --> 00:14:37,279
focused threats

433
00:14:37,279 --> 00:14:38,800
and those were about preventing hackers

434
00:14:38,800 --> 00:14:40,800
from getting access to one's device

435
00:14:40,800 --> 00:14:42,320
and preventing online stores from

436
00:14:42,320 --> 00:14:44,959
misusing wants credit card information

437
00:14:44,959 --> 00:14:46,959
in responses about these threats we

438
00:14:46,959 --> 00:14:49,040
observed 23 cases where participants

439
00:14:49,040 --> 00:14:49,920
conflated

440
00:14:49,920 --> 00:14:52,160
the privacy protections of private

441
00:14:52,160 --> 00:14:53,920
browsing vpns and tour browser

442
00:14:53,920 --> 00:14:56,320
with security protections and in

443
00:14:56,320 --> 00:14:57,519
people's answers

444
00:14:57,519 --> 00:14:59,279
people describe trying to stay safe from

445
00:14:59,279 --> 00:15:00,560
hackers or card fraud

446
00:15:00,560 --> 00:15:02,240
by avoiding being noticed or keeping

447
00:15:02,240 --> 00:15:05,199
information hidden

448
00:15:05,440 --> 00:15:07,600
this participant wrote that private

449
00:15:07,600 --> 00:15:09,440
browsing would be somewhat effective

450
00:15:09,440 --> 00:15:10,880
at preventing hackers from gaining

451
00:15:10,880 --> 00:15:12,480
access to their device

452
00:15:12,480 --> 00:15:14,000
because it should make your device hard

453
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:16,399
to find by hackers

454
00:15:16,399 --> 00:15:18,560
and unfortunately private browsing isn't

455
00:15:18,560 --> 00:15:19,519
going to do that

456
00:15:19,519 --> 00:15:20,800
if a hacker is going to get on your

457
00:15:20,800 --> 00:15:22,720
device they're going to exploit your

458
00:15:22,720 --> 00:15:24,399
browser or more commonly

459
00:15:24,399 --> 00:15:26,480
trick you into installing malware and

460
00:15:26,480 --> 00:15:28,160
private browsing isn't going to protect

461
00:15:28,160 --> 00:15:30,959
against either of those

462
00:15:30,959 --> 00:15:32,800
another participant wrote that vpns

463
00:15:32,800 --> 00:15:34,240
would be very effective

464
00:15:34,240 --> 00:15:35,600
at preventing hackers from getting

465
00:15:35,600 --> 00:15:37,600
access to their device because it's a

466
00:15:37,600 --> 00:15:39,279
virtual network that keeps others from

467
00:15:39,279 --> 00:15:40,399
your device

468
00:15:40,399 --> 00:15:42,959
done well hackers can't find you and

469
00:15:42,959 --> 00:15:44,800
again a vpn isn't going to prevent you

470
00:15:44,800 --> 00:15:45,440
from

471
00:15:45,440 --> 00:15:47,440
downloading and installing malware or

472
00:15:47,440 --> 00:15:48,880
protect you from a

473
00:15:48,880 --> 00:15:52,240
exploit in your browser

474
00:15:53,120 --> 00:15:54,320
so based on the patterns and

475
00:15:54,320 --> 00:15:56,160
misconceptions we identified

476
00:15:56,160 --> 00:15:58,480
we decided on several principles which

477
00:15:58,480 --> 00:16:00,480
might help effective adoption of privacy

478
00:16:00,480 --> 00:16:02,800
tools

479
00:16:02,800 --> 00:16:04,720
first we think that messaging should

480
00:16:04,720 --> 00:16:06,320
focus on helping people protect

481
00:16:06,320 --> 00:16:09,040
themselves from well-defined threats

482
00:16:09,040 --> 00:16:11,120
and this can counter partial knowledge

483
00:16:11,120 --> 00:16:13,680
of tools protections

484
00:16:13,680 --> 00:16:15,759
that might lead people to conflate say

485
00:16:15,759 --> 00:16:19,519
security and privacy protections

486
00:16:19,759 --> 00:16:23,360
we also think that messaging should

487
00:16:23,360 --> 00:16:26,320
help reassure people of the efficacy of

488
00:16:26,320 --> 00:16:28,959
the tools being promoted

489
00:16:28,959 --> 00:16:30,880
and this may help overcome people's

490
00:16:30,880 --> 00:16:34,240
resignation about privacy threats

491
00:16:34,240 --> 00:16:35,920
third we think that messaging should

492
00:16:35,920 --> 00:16:38,240
emphasize the lack of effectiveness

493
00:16:38,240 --> 00:16:40,639
of other tools and practices in order to

494
00:16:40,639 --> 00:16:42,399
increase people's perception

495
00:16:42,399 --> 00:16:44,320
of their susceptibility to privacy

496
00:16:44,320 --> 00:16:46,720
threats

497
00:16:46,959 --> 00:16:48,560
people who are already using tools like

498
00:16:48,560 --> 00:16:50,639
private browsing might think those tools

499
00:16:50,639 --> 00:16:52,480
provide protections that they actually

500
00:16:52,480 --> 00:16:53,360
don't

501
00:16:53,360 --> 00:16:55,440
by emphasizing the limitations of

502
00:16:55,440 --> 00:16:57,279
private browsing and other tools

503
00:16:57,279 --> 00:16:58,480
you might be able to increase the

504
00:16:58,480 --> 00:17:00,160
adoption of more effective tools like

505
00:17:00,160 --> 00:17:01,600
tor browser

506
00:17:01,600 --> 00:17:04,079
now for more details about these

507
00:17:04,079 --> 00:17:05,359
recommendations and other

508
00:17:05,359 --> 00:17:06,720
recommendations

509
00:17:06,720 --> 00:17:09,919
please check out our paper

510
00:17:09,919 --> 00:17:11,520
thank you very much for listening to my

511
00:17:11,520 --> 00:17:13,679
talk and as i mentioned we have more

512
00:17:13,679 --> 00:17:15,520

513
00:17:15,520 --> 00:17:16,240
paper

514
00:17:16,240 --> 00:17:18,480
so please check that out if you have any

515
00:17:18,480 --> 00:17:19,520
