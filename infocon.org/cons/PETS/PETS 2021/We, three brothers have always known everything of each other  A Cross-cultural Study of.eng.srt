welcome to the presentation of our paper

2
00:00:02,960 --> 00:00:03,520
we

3
00:00:03,520 --> 00:00:05,759
three brothers have always known

4
00:00:05,759 --> 00:00:06,720
everything of

5
00:00:06,720 --> 00:00:09,679
each other a cross-cultural study of

6
00:00:09,679 --> 00:00:11,360
sharing digital devices

7
00:00:11,360 --> 00:00:14,320
and online accounts i'm mahdi from utah

state university

9
00:00:15,519 --> 00:00:17,920
we collaborated with jadupu university

10
00:00:17,920 --> 00:00:19,520
and university of dhaka

11
00:00:19,520 --> 00:00:24,080
in this work background

12
00:00:24,080 --> 00:00:26,320
many technologies have been developed

13
00:00:26,320 --> 00:00:27,840
based on the assumption

14
00:00:27,840 --> 00:00:30,320
that they will be used by a single

15
00:00:30,320 --> 00:00:32,079
person

16
00:00:32,079 --> 00:00:34,399
this single user assumption is also

17
00:00:34,399 --> 00:00:35,200
reflected

18
00:00:35,200 --> 00:00:37,680
in the authentication solutions where

19
00:00:37,680 --> 00:00:40,320
entering a password gives access to all

20
00:00:40,320 --> 00:00:42,640
of the contents in a digital device or

21
00:00:42,640 --> 00:00:42,879
an

22
00:00:42,879 --> 00:00:45,920
online account however

23
00:00:45,920 --> 00:00:47,840
this one-to-one mapping between a

24
00:00:47,840 --> 00:00:49,600
technology and a user

25
00:00:49,600 --> 00:00:51,680
does not consider the security

26
00:00:51,680 --> 00:00:52,800
vulnerabilities

27
00:00:52,800 --> 00:00:55,520
and privacy risk for people when they

28
00:00:55,520 --> 00:00:57,120
share their devices or

29
00:00:57,120 --> 00:01:00,719
accounts with others here by sharing

30
00:01:00,719 --> 00:01:03,359
we refer to any situation in which

31
00:01:03,359 --> 00:01:04,720
multiple users

32
00:01:04,720 --> 00:01:07,200
use a single device or account either

33
00:01:07,200 --> 00:01:10,479
synchronously or asynchronously

34
00:01:10,479 --> 00:01:13,280
in this work digital device refers to

35
00:01:13,280 --> 00:01:16,159
the computer and mobile phone

36
00:01:16,159 --> 00:01:18,560
for online accounts we focused on the

37
00:01:18,560 --> 00:01:19,280
sharing of

38
00:01:19,280 --> 00:01:21,759
financial and identity accounts like

39
00:01:21,759 --> 00:01:24,000
email social networking accounts

40
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:27,040
considering the sensitivity of user

41
00:01:27,040 --> 00:01:27,920
information

42
00:01:27,920 --> 00:01:31,520
stored in these accounts

43
00:01:32,400 --> 00:01:34,720
the prior works examine the sharing of

44
00:01:34,720 --> 00:01:37,360
digital devices in a household setting

45
00:01:37,360 --> 00:01:39,840
a recent study also looked into the

46
00:01:39,840 --> 00:01:40,720
sharing of an

47
00:01:40,720 --> 00:01:42,880
online account with the members in a

48
00:01:42,880 --> 00:01:44,079
household like an

49
00:01:44,079 --> 00:01:47,680
entertainment account to watch movies

50
00:01:47,680 --> 00:01:50,399
several studies examined the needs of

51
00:01:50,399 --> 00:01:52,560
sharing devices and accounts with

52
00:01:52,560 --> 00:01:53,600
caregivers

53
00:01:53,600 --> 00:01:56,320
like parents or spouse by the people

54
00:01:56,320 --> 00:01:58,399
with visual impairments or

55
00:01:58,399 --> 00:02:02,320
certain disabilities we extend the

56
00:02:02,320 --> 00:02:03,119
findings from

57
00:02:03,119 --> 00:02:05,200
existing literature where we address

58
00:02:05,200 --> 00:02:06,880
three research questions

59
00:02:06,880 --> 00:02:09,758
first what are the context and reasons

60
00:02:09,758 --> 00:02:10,160
for

61
00:02:10,160 --> 00:02:12,319
sharing digital device and online

62
00:02:12,319 --> 00:02:13,680
accounts when

63
00:02:13,680 --> 00:02:16,400
the share is include not only the

64
00:02:16,400 --> 00:02:18,160
members in a household but

65
00:02:18,160 --> 00:02:20,879
also others in a wide range of personal

66
00:02:20,879 --> 00:02:23,840
social and professional settings

67
00:02:23,840 --> 00:02:26,720
then what are the risk perceptions and

68
00:02:26,720 --> 00:02:27,440
concerns

69
00:02:27,440 --> 00:02:30,879
of users as they share their devices and

70
00:02:30,879 --> 00:02:33,280
accounts

71
00:02:33,280 --> 00:02:35,760
what are the access control stages of

72
00:02:35,760 --> 00:02:37,120
users in the process

73
00:02:37,120 --> 00:02:40,080
of sharing their digital devices and

74
00:02:40,080 --> 00:02:42,080
online accounts

75
00:02:42,080 --> 00:02:44,800
to address these research questions we

76
00:02:44,800 --> 00:02:47,200
conducted a semi-structured interview

77
00:02:47,200 --> 00:02:49,280
with 59 participants

78
00:02:49,280 --> 00:02:52,480
16 of them are women and 43 are men

79
00:02:52,480 --> 00:02:54,959
almost all of our participants were in

80
00:02:54,959 --> 00:02:58,080
the age range of 18 to 55 where

81
00:02:58,080 --> 00:03:00,800
four participants were above 55 years

82
00:03:00,800 --> 00:03:03,040
old

83
00:03:03,200 --> 00:03:05,760
a large body of prior works examined

84
00:03:05,760 --> 00:03:08,159
privacy issues in the western context

85
00:03:08,159 --> 00:03:11,120
including the usa however the recent

86
00:03:11,120 --> 00:03:13,280
literature including the ones conducted

87
00:03:13,280 --> 00:03:14,480
in bangladesh

88
00:03:14,480 --> 00:03:17,360
suggests that privacy is contextual

89
00:03:17,360 --> 00:03:18,000
where

90
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:20,319
we should focus more on digital

91
00:03:20,319 --> 00:03:21,519
technology users

92
00:03:21,519 --> 00:03:23,519
and privacy issues in developing

93
00:03:23,519 --> 00:03:25,360
countries so that

94
00:03:25,360 --> 00:03:28,319
we can have a situated understanding to

95
00:03:28,319 --> 00:03:29,680
explore the design

96
00:03:29,680 --> 00:03:32,879
and privacy policies to this end we

97
00:03:32,879 --> 00:03:33,760
included

98
00:03:33,760 --> 00:03:37,360
both the usa and bangladesh in our study

99
00:03:37,360 --> 00:03:40,000
we also included turkey which is one of

100
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:42,080
the underrepresented countries in

101
00:03:42,080 --> 00:03:44,640
privacy literature

102
00:03:44,640 --> 00:03:46,480
we recruited participants through

103
00:03:46,480 --> 00:03:48,879
posting flyers on public places

104
00:03:48,879 --> 00:03:51,360
social media post email is surf and

105
00:03:51,360 --> 00:03:54,000
snowball sampling

106
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:55,840
we interviewed our participants over

107
00:03:55,840 --> 00:03:58,720
telephone via skype or in person

108
00:03:58,720 --> 00:04:00,879
we conducted interviews in the country's

109
00:04:00,879 --> 00:04:02,400
official language

110
00:04:02,400 --> 00:04:04,720
interviews were audio recorded where

111
00:04:04,720 --> 00:04:07,680
each session took between 25 and 35

112
00:04:07,680 --> 00:04:10,000
minutes on average

113
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:12,560
we transcribed the audio recordings for

114
00:04:12,560 --> 00:04:14,239
the interviews with the participants

115
00:04:14,239 --> 00:04:15,840
from bangladesh and turkey

116
00:04:15,840 --> 00:04:17,918
the researchers who are the native

117
00:04:17,918 --> 00:04:20,880
speakers of bengali and turkish language

118
00:04:20,880 --> 00:04:22,800
translated the transcriptions into

119
00:04:22,800 --> 00:04:24,080
english

120
00:04:24,080 --> 00:04:26,720
then we performed thematic analysis on

121
00:04:26,720 --> 00:04:29,040
our transcriptions

122
00:04:29,040 --> 00:04:31,759
among our participants 22 of them live

123
00:04:31,759 --> 00:04:33,040
in the usa

124
00:04:33,040 --> 00:04:36,400
eight participants live in turkey and 29

125
00:04:36,400 --> 00:04:38,720
participants live in bangladesh

126
00:04:38,720 --> 00:04:41,120
we provided their detailed demographic

127
00:04:41,120 --> 00:04:42,000
information

128
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:45,520
in the paper findings

129
00:04:45,520 --> 00:04:47,680
we will first present our findings on

130
00:04:47,680 --> 00:04:49,120
the context and

131
00:04:49,120 --> 00:04:51,759
reasons of sharing followed by our

132
00:04:51,759 --> 00:04:53,759
participants risk perceptions and

133
00:04:53,759 --> 00:04:54,960
concerns and

134
00:04:54,960 --> 00:04:58,400
access control strategies

135
00:04:58,400 --> 00:05:01,199
on the context and reasons of sharing we

136
00:05:01,199 --> 00:05:04,080
start with geographic relocation

137
00:05:04,080 --> 00:05:06,479
the immigrants experiencing cultural

138
00:05:06,479 --> 00:05:07,280
shifts

139
00:05:07,280 --> 00:05:09,520
adjust in complex ways to their new

140
00:05:09,520 --> 00:05:10,560
society

141
00:05:10,560 --> 00:05:13,280
we found that our immigrant participants

142
00:05:13,280 --> 00:05:14,240
in the usa

143
00:05:14,240 --> 00:05:16,160
collaborate with friends and family

144
00:05:16,160 --> 00:05:18,720
members living in their native country

145
00:05:18,720 --> 00:05:21,440
to regain or maintain access to their

146
00:05:21,440 --> 00:05:22,720
online accounts

147
00:05:22,720 --> 00:05:25,600
along with remotely managing financial

148
00:05:25,600 --> 00:05:27,280
transactions

149
00:05:27,280 --> 00:05:29,840
for example one of our participants

150
00:05:29,840 --> 00:05:30,880
forgot the

151
00:05:30,880 --> 00:05:33,280
password of her email account after

152
00:05:33,280 --> 00:05:34,880
moving to the usa

153
00:05:34,880 --> 00:05:38,240
and did not have a recovery email but

154
00:05:38,240 --> 00:05:41,039
a recovery mobile phone number that she

155
00:05:41,039 --> 00:05:44,560
used to use in her native country

156
00:05:44,560 --> 00:05:47,520
eventually she recovered her access to

157
00:05:47,520 --> 00:05:48,800
that email account

158
00:05:48,800 --> 00:05:51,039
through creating a new password in

159
00:05:51,039 --> 00:05:52,000
collaboration with

160
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:55,280
a friend in her native country whom she

161
00:05:55,280 --> 00:05:56,000
had to

162
00:05:56,000 --> 00:06:00,240
mail her old mobile sim card

163
00:06:00,240 --> 00:06:02,639
a few of our participants who are from

164
00:06:02,639 --> 00:06:05,199
the countries in asia and currently live

165
00:06:05,199 --> 00:06:06,400
in the usa

166
00:06:06,400 --> 00:06:08,560
shared their login credentials for a

167
00:06:08,560 --> 00:06:10,479
banking account with their

168
00:06:10,479 --> 00:06:12,960
spouse or parents living in their native

169
00:06:12,960 --> 00:06:14,160
country

170
00:06:14,160 --> 00:06:16,720
so that their family members in home

171
00:06:16,720 --> 00:06:18,160
country can address

172
00:06:18,160 --> 00:06:20,160
any urgent financial needs or

173
00:06:20,160 --> 00:06:21,199
transaction

174
00:06:21,199 --> 00:06:23,520
by skipping the latency to reach out to

175
00:06:23,520 --> 00:06:26,560
our participants

176
00:06:27,759 --> 00:06:30,400
as it comes to collaboratively managing

177
00:06:30,400 --> 00:06:32,960
financial activities within a family

178
00:06:32,960 --> 00:06:35,520
the sharing of a financial account

179
00:06:35,520 --> 00:06:37,600
depends upon family structure

180
00:06:37,600 --> 00:06:40,960
and dynamics for example participants

181
00:06:40,960 --> 00:06:43,440
living in bangladesh and turkey are

182
00:06:43,440 --> 00:06:45,919
comfortable with sharing their financial

183
00:06:45,919 --> 00:06:47,199
accounts with

184
00:06:47,199 --> 00:06:49,120
multiple members in their extended

185
00:06:49,120 --> 00:06:51,199
family which is less common

186
00:06:51,199 --> 00:06:53,680
in the nuclear family setting of our

187
00:06:53,680 --> 00:06:54,560
participants

188
00:06:54,560 --> 00:06:58,000
living in the usa a few participants

189
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:00,479
mentioned having a contingency plan in

190
00:07:00,479 --> 00:07:02,800
case of an emergency situation

191
00:07:02,800 --> 00:07:05,360
where they might not be able to access

192
00:07:05,360 --> 00:07:07,039
their bank accounts

193
00:07:07,039 --> 00:07:09,759
so they share their login credentials

194
00:07:09,759 --> 00:07:11,759
with their family members especially the

195
00:07:11,759 --> 00:07:12,720
spouse

196
00:07:12,720 --> 00:07:15,520
so as to ensure accessibility to their

197
00:07:15,520 --> 00:07:16,160
financial

198
00:07:16,160 --> 00:07:18,560
accounts

199
00:07:20,319 --> 00:07:22,960
we found instances of sharing devices

200
00:07:22,960 --> 00:07:25,199
and online accounts as a way of

201
00:07:25,199 --> 00:07:28,400
building trust with romantic partners to

202
00:07:28,400 --> 00:07:31,599
express affection to friends as well as

203
00:07:31,599 --> 00:07:33,919
to maintain transparency in a conjugal

204
00:07:33,919 --> 00:07:36,159
life

205
00:07:36,319 --> 00:07:38,479
a few participants from bangladesh

206
00:07:38,479 --> 00:07:40,960
mention that they are habituated to

207
00:07:40,960 --> 00:07:43,759
and are comfortable with sharing their

208
00:07:43,759 --> 00:07:45,120
personal belongings

209
00:07:45,120 --> 00:07:48,400
and information with a closed circle

210
00:07:48,400 --> 00:07:51,039
this closed circle comprises siblings

211
00:07:51,039 --> 00:07:52,479
cousins or friends

212
00:07:52,479 --> 00:07:55,840
with whom they have grown up now

213
00:07:55,840 --> 00:07:58,319
as the participants have stepped into

214
00:07:58,319 --> 00:08:00,319
using online accounts

215
00:08:00,319 --> 00:08:03,919
it comes out as natural and expected to

216
00:08:03,919 --> 00:08:04,479
them

217
00:08:04,479 --> 00:08:06,960
that their login credentials would be

218
00:08:06,960 --> 00:08:08,240
shared within their

219
00:08:08,240 --> 00:08:11,039
closed circle

220
00:08:11,680 --> 00:08:13,599
several participants from turkey and

221
00:08:13,599 --> 00:08:15,840
bangladesh have stated that a digital

222
00:08:15,840 --> 00:08:17,199
device purchased by

223
00:08:17,199 --> 00:08:19,120
any of their family members is

224
00:08:19,120 --> 00:08:21,360
considered as a common property of the

225
00:08:21,360 --> 00:08:23,599
inhabitants at their home

226
00:08:23,599 --> 00:08:26,560
our participant bp4 who lives with her

227
00:08:26,560 --> 00:08:28,560
extended family in bangladesh

228
00:08:28,560 --> 00:08:31,199
purchased a laptop she explained the

229
00:08:31,199 --> 00:08:33,279
sharing of her laptop with the family

230
00:08:33,279 --> 00:08:34,159
members

231
00:08:34,159 --> 00:08:36,719
at her home as we see in her comment on

232
00:08:36,719 --> 00:08:40,559
the slide

233
00:08:40,559 --> 00:08:42,958
when shared the position of a digital

234
00:08:42,958 --> 00:08:45,120
device might not be constrained by a

235
00:08:45,120 --> 00:08:46,560
physical boundary

236
00:08:46,560 --> 00:08:49,440
like our participant bp27 gave an

237
00:08:49,440 --> 00:08:50,320
example

238
00:08:50,320 --> 00:08:52,800
when my brother goes to coaching class

239
00:08:52,800 --> 00:08:54,080
he needs a mobile phone

240
00:08:54,080 --> 00:08:57,600
so he borrows mine while such sharing is

241
00:08:57,600 --> 00:08:59,600
culturally expected in bangladesh and

242
00:08:59,600 --> 00:09:00,399
turkey

243
00:09:00,399 --> 00:09:02,800
participants also referred to economic

244
00:09:02,800 --> 00:09:05,360
constraints in several instances

245
00:09:05,360 --> 00:09:07,920
as to why they could not afford a

246
00:09:07,920 --> 00:09:09,279
separate device for

247
00:09:09,279 --> 00:09:12,800
individual family members

248
00:09:14,399 --> 00:09:17,279
in recent years the use of online social

249
00:09:17,279 --> 00:09:19,600
networks has experienced a sharp price

250
00:09:19,600 --> 00:09:21,440
in many developing countries including

251
00:09:21,440 --> 00:09:22,720
bangladesh

252
00:09:22,720 --> 00:09:25,519
some of our relatively older or less

253
00:09:25,519 --> 00:09:27,920
educated participants from bangladesh

254
00:09:27,920 --> 00:09:30,080
use the social networking site in a

255
00:09:30,080 --> 00:09:31,600
collaborative manner

256
00:09:31,600 --> 00:09:34,160
where they build a small group with

257
00:09:34,160 --> 00:09:35,279
trusted peers

258
00:09:35,279 --> 00:09:38,000
to collaboratively use a single social

259
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:40,160
networking account

260
00:09:40,160 --> 00:09:42,640
the members in search group help each

261
00:09:42,640 --> 00:09:45,040
other to address technical issues

262
00:09:45,040 --> 00:09:47,600
learn and use new features and settings

263
00:09:47,600 --> 00:09:48,080
recall

264
00:09:48,080 --> 00:09:50,720
password if forgotten and maintain an

265
00:09:50,720 --> 00:09:53,279
online presence when one's internet data

266
00:09:53,279 --> 00:09:54,240
budget is

267
00:09:54,240 --> 00:09:56,880
exhausted

268
00:09:57,680 --> 00:09:59,839
among the participants from bangladesh

269
00:09:59,839 --> 00:10:02,000
several of them are the owner of

270
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:05,040
our employees at digital service centers

271
00:10:05,040 --> 00:10:07,279
that offer a variety of services to

272
00:10:07,279 --> 00:10:08,560
their customers

273
00:10:08,560 --> 00:10:10,480
which include filling an online

274
00:10:10,480 --> 00:10:11,760
application for

275
00:10:11,760 --> 00:10:14,800
job visa or academic admission paying

276
00:10:14,800 --> 00:10:17,200
fees online printing photocopying and

277
00:10:17,200 --> 00:10:18,560
sending emails

278
00:10:18,560 --> 00:10:22,000
our participant bp23 who is the owner of

279
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:23,600
a digital service center

280
00:10:23,600 --> 00:10:26,399
in bangladesh has explained how they

281
00:10:26,399 --> 00:10:26,959
manage

282
00:10:26,959 --> 00:10:29,600
paying online fees for their customers

283
00:10:29,600 --> 00:10:33,839
that we see in his comment on the slide

284
00:10:34,399 --> 00:10:36,480
the computer with administrative

285
00:10:36,480 --> 00:10:38,640
privilege is shared with the customers

286
00:10:38,640 --> 00:10:39,600
for use

287
00:10:39,600 --> 00:10:42,320
in this digital service center where our

288
00:10:42,320 --> 00:10:43,120
participant

289
00:10:43,120 --> 00:10:45,519
explained the scenario in this way

290
00:10:45,519 --> 00:10:47,200
sometimes the customer

291
00:10:47,200 --> 00:10:49,760
needs to edit their document before

292
00:10:49,760 --> 00:10:50,720
printing

293
00:10:50,720 --> 00:10:53,680
also when the work pressure is low we

294
00:10:53,680 --> 00:10:56,720
give them access to browse the internet

295
00:10:56,720 --> 00:10:59,440
here internet browsing is not one of

296
00:10:59,440 --> 00:11:00,000
their core

297
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:03,120
services rather offered to the customers

298
00:11:03,120 --> 00:11:05,040
as an informal service

299
00:11:05,040 --> 00:11:08,399
if there is a scope

300
00:11:08,560 --> 00:11:10,959
several participants from bangladesh who

301
00:11:10,959 --> 00:11:13,839
are relatively older or less educated

302
00:11:13,839 --> 00:11:16,399
reported taking help from others with

303
00:11:16,399 --> 00:11:17,040
creating

304
00:11:17,040 --> 00:11:19,760
and managing their online accounts in

305
00:11:19,760 --> 00:11:20,880
this process

306
00:11:20,880 --> 00:11:23,360
a caregiver either created a password

307
00:11:23,360 --> 00:11:24,240
for them

308
00:11:24,240 --> 00:11:26,480
or participants shared their

309
00:11:26,480 --> 00:11:28,240
authentication secrets with the

310
00:11:28,240 --> 00:11:30,000
caregiver

311
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:34,079
for instance when our participant bp27

312
00:11:34,079 --> 00:11:36,160
first came to know about the online

313
00:11:36,160 --> 00:11:37,360
social network

314
00:11:37,360 --> 00:11:39,680
he was not quite sure about how to

315
00:11:39,680 --> 00:11:40,959
create an account

316
00:11:40,959 --> 00:11:44,399
so he reached out to one of his friends

317
00:11:44,399 --> 00:11:46,800
who helped him with registering for

318
00:11:46,800 --> 00:11:47,839
facebook

319
00:11:47,839 --> 00:11:50,800
and created a password for him that he

320
00:11:50,800 --> 00:11:51,120
is

321
00:11:51,120 --> 00:11:53,839
still using

322
00:11:54,240 --> 00:11:56,399
we will now look into our findings on

323
00:11:56,399 --> 00:11:59,120
the risk perceptions and concerns of our

324
00:11:59,120 --> 00:12:01,920
participants

325
00:12:03,680 --> 00:12:06,000
a few participants reported concern

326
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:08,320
about multiple users using the same

327
00:12:08,320 --> 00:12:10,240
computer in their workplace

328
00:12:10,240 --> 00:12:12,480
where a shared computer could be

329
00:12:12,480 --> 00:12:14,079
infected with malware

330
00:12:14,079 --> 00:12:17,440
if one of the users is not careful

331
00:12:17,440 --> 00:12:21,120
like our participant up17 reported her

332
00:12:21,120 --> 00:12:22,800
experience of losing data

333
00:12:22,800 --> 00:12:27,040
and files from a shared computer

334
00:12:28,240 --> 00:12:30,320
our participants audit about

335
00:12:30,320 --> 00:12:32,399
unpredictable human traits

336
00:12:32,399 --> 00:12:34,800
which could be influenced by a change in

337
00:12:34,800 --> 00:12:37,519
relationship between peers over time

338
00:12:37,519 --> 00:12:40,240
where we found that the personal

339
00:12:40,240 --> 00:12:41,360
contents taken

340
00:12:41,360 --> 00:12:44,320
into possession from shared devices were

341
00:12:44,320 --> 00:12:45,040
used

342
00:12:45,040 --> 00:12:49,439
to blackmail our participants family

343
00:12:50,839 --> 00:12:52,079
members

344
00:12:52,079 --> 00:12:53,839
at a digital service center in

345
00:12:53,839 --> 00:12:56,720
bangladesh people are not careful enough

346
00:12:56,720 --> 00:12:59,040
in protecting their information

347
00:12:59,040 --> 00:13:01,200
when they share their personal device

348
00:13:01,200 --> 00:13:02,480
with a shopkeeper

349
00:13:02,480 --> 00:13:05,360
to avail the repair service in this

350
00:13:05,360 --> 00:13:06,399
context

351
00:13:06,399 --> 00:13:08,560
one of the participants who works in a

352
00:13:08,560 --> 00:13:10,240
digital service center

353
00:13:10,240 --> 00:13:13,440
reported an incident of an intentional

354
00:13:13,440 --> 00:13:15,120
privacy breach as we see

355
00:13:15,120 --> 00:13:18,639
in his comment on the slide

356
00:13:18,880 --> 00:13:22,000
another participant bp28 told us

357
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:24,720
about an unintentional privacy leakage

358
00:13:24,720 --> 00:13:27,040
of his family members from a

359
00:13:27,040 --> 00:13:31,120
shared computer at his home

360
00:13:32,320 --> 00:13:34,639
several participants are concerned that

361
00:13:34,639 --> 00:13:36,880
the entities with whom they share their

362
00:13:36,880 --> 00:13:37,920
devices

363
00:13:37,920 --> 00:13:40,160
might exploit them for a wrong or

364
00:13:40,160 --> 00:13:41,680
unethical purpose

365
00:13:41,680 --> 00:13:44,079
a few of them also reflected on their

366
00:13:44,079 --> 00:13:45,680
experiences from the past

367
00:13:45,680 --> 00:13:49,040
where the participant bp 14 shared an

368
00:13:49,040 --> 00:13:52,160
incident that did put her family in an

369
00:13:52,160 --> 00:13:55,279
embarrassing situation

370
00:13:56,480 --> 00:13:58,800
our participants comfort with sharing a

371
00:13:58,800 --> 00:14:01,199
divisor account is often rooted in the

372
00:14:01,199 --> 00:14:02,079
accountability

373
00:14:02,079 --> 00:14:05,199
of shares whom they know in person and

374
00:14:05,199 --> 00:14:05,920
could

375
00:14:05,920 --> 00:14:08,959
trust with protecting their privacy here

376
00:14:08,959 --> 00:14:11,199
secondary sharing is a matter of concern

377
00:14:11,199 --> 00:14:13,279
to several participants where

378
00:14:13,279 --> 00:14:15,600
the current shares of their online

379
00:14:15,600 --> 00:14:16,399
account

380
00:14:16,399 --> 00:14:18,480
could share the login credentials of

381
00:14:18,480 --> 00:14:20,079
that account with

382
00:14:20,079 --> 00:14:23,519
other entities without informing them

383
00:14:23,519 --> 00:14:26,399
for example one of our participants told

384
00:14:26,399 --> 00:14:28,000
about a friend of hers

385
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:30,480
with whom she had shared the login

386
00:14:30,480 --> 00:14:33,279
credentials for her university account

387
00:14:33,279 --> 00:14:36,240
to let her access the university's wi-fi

388
00:14:36,240 --> 00:14:37,519
network

389
00:14:37,519 --> 00:14:40,720
later she found that her friend had

390
00:14:40,720 --> 00:14:42,560
shared her password with

391
00:14:42,560 --> 00:14:45,279
more people allowing them access to her

392
00:14:45,279 --> 00:14:48,880
university's wi-fi network

393
00:14:50,800 --> 00:14:53,440
we found several instances that are not

394
00:14:53,440 --> 00:14:55,839
limited within the boundary of personal

395
00:14:55,839 --> 00:14:58,160
trust and privacy violation but

396
00:14:58,160 --> 00:15:00,560
also raised a question of legality and

397
00:15:00,560 --> 00:15:02,639
socially accepted behavior

398
00:15:02,639 --> 00:15:05,120
in bangladesh a national id card is

399
00:15:05,120 --> 00:15:07,760
required to purchase a mobile sim card

400
00:15:07,760 --> 00:15:10,000
one of our participants who is the owner

401
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:11,680
of a digital service center in

402
00:15:11,680 --> 00:15:12,639
bangladesh

403
00:15:12,639 --> 00:15:15,680
keeps a scanned copy of his national id

404
00:15:15,680 --> 00:15:17,120
card on his computer

405
00:15:17,120 --> 00:15:19,760
at the workplace the password of this

406
00:15:19,760 --> 00:15:22,320
computer is shared with his employees

407
00:15:22,320 --> 00:15:24,959
he explained to us how an employee at

408
00:15:24,959 --> 00:15:26,800
his digital service center

409
00:15:26,800 --> 00:15:29,839
had misused this excess privilege by

410
00:15:29,839 --> 00:15:32,720
taking a copy of his national id card

411
00:15:32,720 --> 00:15:33,360
from the

412
00:15:33,360 --> 00:15:36,240
shared computer to purchase a mobile sim

413
00:15:36,240 --> 00:15:38,240
card

414
00:15:38,240 --> 00:15:41,680
access control strategies most of our

415
00:15:41,680 --> 00:15:44,000
participants do not take any steps to

416
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:45,920
protect their privacy while

417
00:15:45,920 --> 00:15:48,800
sharing a device or account where the

418
00:15:48,800 --> 00:15:51,360
reasons reported by our participants

419
00:15:51,360 --> 00:15:54,000
confirm several findings from existing

420
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:55,360
literature to hold

421
00:15:55,360 --> 00:15:58,079
true in the context of sharing devices

422
00:15:58,079 --> 00:15:59,120
and accounts

423
00:15:59,120 --> 00:16:01,519
both within and outside of western

424
00:16:01,519 --> 00:16:02,399
context

425
00:16:02,399 --> 00:16:05,199
including lack of knowledge optimism

426
00:16:05,199 --> 00:16:05,839
bias

427
00:16:05,839 --> 00:16:08,320
and procrastination until harm's

428
00:16:08,320 --> 00:16:09,600
occurred

429
00:16:09,600 --> 00:16:11,839
we also found that participants from

430
00:16:11,839 --> 00:16:13,360
bangladesh and turkey

431
00:16:13,360 --> 00:16:15,839
put blind trust on the technology to

432
00:16:15,839 --> 00:16:16,399
protect

433
00:16:16,399 --> 00:16:19,360
user information they perceived that

434
00:16:19,360 --> 00:16:21,920
technology has advanced to a point that

435
00:16:21,920 --> 00:16:22,560
users

436
00:16:22,560 --> 00:16:25,440
no longer need to worry about security

437
00:16:25,440 --> 00:16:27,839
or privacy issues

438
00:16:27,839 --> 00:16:30,320
our study unpaired to the ad hoc based

439
00:16:30,320 --> 00:16:32,800
strategies adopted by users for privacy

440
00:16:32,800 --> 00:16:33,680
protection

441
00:16:33,680 --> 00:16:36,160
while sharing a device or account where

442
00:16:36,160 --> 00:16:36,800
we found

443
00:16:36,800 --> 00:16:39,279
that some of these approaches could pass

444
00:16:39,279 --> 00:16:41,600
privacy risk for the shares

445
00:16:41,600 --> 00:16:43,920
for instance a few participants have

446
00:16:43,920 --> 00:16:45,600
reported that when they share

447
00:16:45,600 --> 00:16:47,279
their mobile phone with an unknown

448
00:16:47,279 --> 00:16:50,079
person they stand beside that person

449
00:16:50,079 --> 00:16:52,720
to observe his activities on the phone

450
00:16:52,720 --> 00:16:53,920
to ensure that

451
00:16:53,920 --> 00:16:56,639
he does not access any of their personal

452
00:16:56,639 --> 00:16:58,399
documents

453
00:16:58,399 --> 00:17:00,959
future work our findings should not be

454
00:17:00,959 --> 00:17:02,800
generalized to the entire population in

455
00:17:02,800 --> 00:17:04,799
the world where more studies are

456
00:17:04,799 --> 00:17:06,959
required including a large scale online

457
00:17:06,959 --> 00:17:08,480
survey with the participants from

458
00:17:08,480 --> 00:17:11,199
different countries and societies

459
00:17:11,199 --> 00:17:13,280
our findings on collaborative use of

460
00:17:13,280 --> 00:17:15,760
online accounts at new dimensions to the

461
00:17:15,760 --> 00:17:17,839
discussion on digital inclusion in a

462
00:17:17,839 --> 00:17:19,039
developing country

463
00:17:19,039 --> 00:17:21,919
where we emphasize on future research to

464
00:17:21,919 --> 00:17:22,319
gain

465
00:17:22,319 --> 00:17:24,319
further insights into the corresponding

466
00:17:24,319 --> 00:17:27,520
privacy and social implications

467
00:17:27,520 --> 00:17:29,760
our participants reported concerns and

468
00:17:29,760 --> 00:17:31,919
told us about incidence reflecting

469
00:17:31,919 --> 00:17:34,799
unexpected outcomes of secondary sharing

470
00:17:34,799 --> 00:17:37,039
we believe that future studies should

471
00:17:37,039 --> 00:17:39,520
focus more on this issue

472
00:17:39,520 --> 00:17:41,919
also it would be an interesting avenue

473
00:17:41,919 --> 00:17:44,160
for future research to look into

474
00:17:44,160 --> 00:17:46,000
the privacy negotiation from the

475
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:47,679
perspective of shares

476
00:17:47,679 --> 00:17:50,000
where we found that the sharer of a

477
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:51,840
device sometimes use surveillance

478
00:17:51,840 --> 00:17:52,960
techniques like

479
00:17:52,960 --> 00:17:55,600
standing beside a sherry to observe

480
00:17:55,600 --> 00:17:58,080
their activities on the shared device

481
00:17:58,080 --> 00:17:59,440
thank you for listening to our

482
00:17:59,440 --> 00:18:01,840
presentation
