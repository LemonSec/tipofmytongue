00:00:00,880 --> 00:00:03,760
welcome to my talk about swap ct a swap

3
00:00:03,760 --> 00:00:06,080
confidential transaction system

4
00:00:06,080 --> 00:00:08,160
this is joint work with lucas miller

5
00:00:08,160 --> 00:00:10,000
andreas peter from cargill

6
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:14,160
and christoph bush so let's have a look

7
00:00:14,160 --> 00:00:17,199
at private and confidential token

8
00:00:17,199 --> 00:00:19,279
transfers

9
00:00:19,279 --> 00:00:21,119
let's assume that we have a setting with

10
00:00:21,119 --> 00:00:22,480
four participants

11
00:00:22,480 --> 00:00:25,199
where ponytail transfers three dollars

12
00:00:25,199 --> 00:00:25,920
to megan

13
00:00:25,920 --> 00:00:28,480
transfers three dollars to cue ball and

14
00:00:28,480 --> 00:00:31,840
then transfer three dollars to whitehead

15
00:00:31,840 --> 00:00:35,120
for our consideration we look at

16
00:00:35,120 --> 00:00:37,200
look at the privacy from the view of

17
00:00:37,200 --> 00:00:38,239
megan so

18
00:00:38,239 --> 00:00:40,879
first we need send an anonymity so megan

19
00:00:40,879 --> 00:00:41,920
should not

20
00:00:41,920 --> 00:00:44,160
figure out who sent her the three

21
00:00:44,160 --> 00:00:45,840
dollars

22
00:00:45,840 --> 00:00:48,800
and in the same direction we need

23
00:00:48,800 --> 00:00:50,480
receiver anonymity

24
00:00:50,480 --> 00:00:53,360
so that you need your you need to know

25
00:00:53,360 --> 00:00:55,120
your immediate recipient but

26
00:00:55,120 --> 00:00:57,440
of course what they do with their tokens

27
00:00:57,440 --> 00:00:59,199
should be totally

28
00:00:59,199 --> 00:01:02,559
irrelevant to you then you need value

29
00:01:02,559 --> 00:01:03,840
confidentiality

30
00:01:03,840 --> 00:01:05,600
and type confidentiality for all

31
00:01:05,600 --> 00:01:07,840
transactions which are your where you're

32
00:01:07,840 --> 00:01:08,159
not

33
00:01:08,159 --> 00:01:11,760
involved in to deploy this whole system

34
00:01:11,760 --> 00:01:14,159
in some permissionless setting we also

35
00:01:14,159 --> 00:01:16,400
want a transparent setup so that we

36
00:01:16,400 --> 00:01:20,080
don't um need someone

37
00:01:20,080 --> 00:01:23,200
to perform a trusted ceremony um

38
00:01:23,200 --> 00:01:27,600
and in the same spirit of openness and

39
00:01:27,600 --> 00:01:29,920
privacy we also want non-interactive

40
00:01:29,920 --> 00:01:30,880
transactions

41
00:01:30,880 --> 00:01:32,799
so this is important one for

42
00:01:32,799 --> 00:01:35,040
functionality that if your recipient is

43
00:01:35,040 --> 00:01:35,680
not

44
00:01:35,680 --> 00:01:37,920
present you should still be able to

45
00:01:37,920 --> 00:01:38,880
transfer the

46
00:01:38,880 --> 00:01:41,520
tokens and the other thing is that if

47
00:01:41,520 --> 00:01:43,680
you have to interact with your recipient

48
00:01:43,680 --> 00:01:46,399
they might come back and stab you so

49
00:01:46,399 --> 00:01:47,920
thereby it also helps

50
00:01:47,920 --> 00:01:49,680
the privacy if you don't need to

51
00:01:49,680 --> 00:01:51,680
interact with the recipients

52
00:01:51,680 --> 00:01:54,079
so far for transactions so we know how

53
00:01:54,079 --> 00:01:57,439
megan can transfer three dollars to cuba

54
00:01:57,439 --> 00:02:00,640
but how about swaps so a swap

55
00:02:00,640 --> 00:02:02,960
is more or less an exchange of tokens

56
00:02:02,960 --> 00:02:04,000
and sometimes

57
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:06,240
for another amount of tokens in a

58
00:02:06,240 --> 00:02:07,439
different type

59
00:02:07,439 --> 00:02:09,679
and we want him to be non-interactive so

60
00:02:09,679 --> 00:02:11,440
for example cuboid wants to

61
00:02:11,440 --> 00:02:16,080
exchange his three dollars for one euro

62
00:02:16,080 --> 00:02:18,480
and he just doesn't care who will

63
00:02:18,480 --> 00:02:20,080
actually fulfill the

64
00:02:20,080 --> 00:02:22,160
exchange but of course somebody needs to

65
00:02:22,160 --> 00:02:23,599
needs to exchange the

66
00:02:23,599 --> 00:02:25,440
cue ball cannot exchange with the system

67
00:02:25,440 --> 00:02:26,640
itself but

68
00:02:26,640 --> 00:02:28,640
it should be non-intellectual so he will

69
00:02:28,640 --> 00:02:30,239
sends out the offer and then

70
00:02:30,239 --> 00:02:34,000
at one later point um he might receive

71
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:37,760
one euro so somebody might pick up the

72
00:02:37,760 --> 00:02:38,239
offer

73
00:02:38,239 --> 00:02:41,360
and then fulfill the swap transaction

74
00:02:41,360 --> 00:02:43,440
so it is important that this is an

75
00:02:43,440 --> 00:02:44,720
atomic swap

76
00:02:44,720 --> 00:02:48,879
which means that neither party can abort

77
00:02:48,879 --> 00:02:51,920
with the benefit or in in the middle of

78
00:02:51,920 --> 00:02:53,040
the project and

79
00:02:53,040 --> 00:02:56,080
not and and the the honest party would

80
00:02:56,080 --> 00:02:56,720
lose

81
00:02:56,720 --> 00:02:59,280
uh focus in this system so that's why we

82
00:02:59,280 --> 00:03:01,440
need atomic swaps

83
00:03:01,440 --> 00:03:04,560
and what we require on top to

84
00:03:04,560 --> 00:03:06,800
to make the the system more trading

85
00:03:06,800 --> 00:03:07,920
friendly

86
00:03:07,920 --> 00:03:10,800
is that these swap transactions should

87
00:03:10,800 --> 00:03:11,360
be

88
00:03:11,360 --> 00:03:14,400
um indistinguishable from normal

89
00:03:14,400 --> 00:03:15,440
transaction of

90
00:03:15,440 --> 00:03:18,800
like non-swaps and this helps the

91
00:03:18,800 --> 00:03:20,080
anonymity of

92
00:03:20,080 --> 00:03:23,280
this deciphering between a swap and a

93
00:03:23,280 --> 00:03:25,280
standard transaction

94
00:03:25,280 --> 00:03:28,560
they all share one anonymity set so

95
00:03:28,560 --> 00:03:31,360
why do we need to exchange tokens and

96
00:03:31,360 --> 00:03:33,200
work with tokens and have this

97
00:03:33,200 --> 00:03:35,360
notion of tokens because why it wouldn't

98
00:03:35,360 --> 00:03:36,239
be just

99
00:03:36,239 --> 00:03:37,920
one currency with one value be

100
00:03:37,920 --> 00:03:40,239
sufficient because we saw that

101
00:03:40,239 --> 00:03:42,159
people use them if we look at the

102
00:03:42,159 --> 00:03:44,480
ethereum

103
00:03:44,480 --> 00:03:47,120
ecosystem we have several tokens living

104
00:03:47,120 --> 00:03:49,760
on there as you see 20 smart contracts

105
00:03:49,760 --> 00:03:51,840
and there are many of them so between

106
00:03:51,840 --> 00:03:52,879
each of them

107
00:03:52,879 --> 00:03:56,000
there is another one and that continues

108
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:59,439
so there are plenty of use cases even if

109
00:03:59,439 --> 00:04:01,360
only a fraction of them are

110
00:04:01,360 --> 00:04:04,640
useful use cases there is definitely an

111
00:04:04,640 --> 00:04:05,519
interest in

112
00:04:05,519 --> 00:04:09,280
privacy preserving tokens so if we

113
00:04:09,280 --> 00:04:13,120
if we look at recent work we want to

114
00:04:13,120 --> 00:04:15,840
evaluate that with different properties

115
00:04:15,840 --> 00:04:17,120
so we need

116
00:04:17,120 --> 00:04:18,798
as explained before we need standard

117
00:04:18,798 --> 00:04:20,720
receiving anonymity we want value

118
00:04:20,720 --> 00:04:22,240
confidentiality we want type

119
00:04:22,240 --> 00:04:24,240
confidentiality

120
00:04:24,240 --> 00:04:26,720
we want a transparent setup

121
00:04:26,720 --> 00:04:28,880
non-interactive transactions

122
00:04:28,880 --> 00:04:32,880
and atomic swaps within the

123
00:04:32,880 --> 00:04:35,120
which are only make sense if we have

124
00:04:35,120 --> 00:04:36,639
type confidentiality

125
00:04:36,639 --> 00:04:39,120
and then we just show how they achieve

126
00:04:39,120 --> 00:04:39,919
it with some

127
00:04:39,919 --> 00:04:42,080
high-level building blocks one of the

128
00:04:42,080 --> 00:04:44,080
most prominent

129
00:04:44,080 --> 00:04:45,919
privacy preserving transaction system is

130
00:04:45,919 --> 00:04:47,280
zip cache which

131
00:04:47,280 --> 00:04:49,120
achieves everything except of the

132
00:04:49,120 --> 00:04:51,600
transparent setup

133
00:04:51,600 --> 00:04:54,560
then we have stellar which is which

134
00:04:54,560 --> 00:04:55,600
defines that

135
00:04:55,600 --> 00:04:58,080
any transaction which is representable

136
00:04:58,080 --> 00:05:00,080
as a rank one constraint system

137
00:05:00,080 --> 00:05:03,680
uh can be performed and thereby

138
00:05:03,680 --> 00:05:07,280
and it works on committed values so

139
00:05:07,280 --> 00:05:09,840
even type and value conf value

140
00:05:09,840 --> 00:05:11,280
confidentiality is

141
00:05:11,280 --> 00:05:13,840
achieved however they don't have any

142
00:05:13,840 --> 00:05:17,680
notion of sender receiver unlimited

143
00:05:17,680 --> 00:05:19,919
member women is awesome it's super

144
00:05:19,919 --> 00:05:21,440
scalable efficient

145
00:05:21,440 --> 00:05:24,960
it has no accounts and thereby achieves

146
00:05:24,960 --> 00:05:26,800
kind of center and receiving anonymity

147
00:05:26,800 --> 00:05:28,320
the problem there is that

148
00:05:28,320 --> 00:05:30,880
we have interactive transactions so you

149
00:05:30,880 --> 00:05:31,440
need to

150
00:05:31,440 --> 00:05:33,919
talk to the recipient and then you can

151
00:05:33,919 --> 00:05:37,120
do a lot more fancy stuff

152
00:05:37,120 --> 00:05:40,800
quiz quiz is a different approach which

153
00:05:40,800 --> 00:05:43,680
focuses on the fact that the state

154
00:05:43,680 --> 00:05:45,120
growth

155
00:05:45,120 --> 00:05:48,160
and in in most other

156
00:05:48,160 --> 00:05:50,560
transaction systems which because you

157
00:05:50,560 --> 00:05:52,160
cannot prune and quiz quiz

158
00:05:52,160 --> 00:05:54,240
is able to prune stuff but there the

159
00:05:54,240 --> 00:05:55,680
issue is integrating type

160
00:05:55,680 --> 00:05:57,600
confidentiality

161
00:05:57,600 --> 00:06:00,000
so that was not suitable as a base to

162
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:01,199
achieve our

163
00:06:01,199 --> 00:06:05,440
goal then we look at monero which uses

164
00:06:05,440 --> 00:06:08,240
ring-based signatures to to create an

165
00:06:08,240 --> 00:06:10,000
anonymity set

166
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:13,120
but monero doesn't have a notion of type

167
00:06:13,120 --> 00:06:15,440
and they because they don't have types

168
00:06:15,440 --> 00:06:17,520
they don't need atomic swaps

169
00:06:17,520 --> 00:06:20,639
and omni ring is more or less monero

170
00:06:20,639 --> 00:06:24,000
in the functionality but with a

171
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:26,160
solid formalization and a way more

172
00:06:26,160 --> 00:06:27,680
efficient bulletproof than the right

173
00:06:27,680 --> 00:06:30,000
thingages of monero

174
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:34,400
and we use parts of all of the different

175
00:06:34,400 --> 00:06:37,199
signature types or transaction systems

176
00:06:37,199 --> 00:06:37,840
and

177
00:06:37,840 --> 00:06:40,160
build swap city which uses some

178
00:06:40,160 --> 00:06:42,160
formalization of the omni ring because

179
00:06:42,160 --> 00:06:44,720
we are also in the ring anonymity

180
00:06:44,720 --> 00:06:45,680
setting

181
00:06:45,680 --> 00:06:48,000
and we provide an additional feature

182
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:48,720
which is

183
00:06:48,720 --> 00:06:51,840
anonymously aggregatable signatures for

184
00:06:51,840 --> 00:06:56,240
these atomic swaps so

185
00:06:56,240 --> 00:06:58,400
one option which we briefly looked at

186
00:06:58,400 --> 00:06:59,520
but discarded then

187
00:06:59,520 --> 00:07:02,560
is that you can also do privacy

188
00:07:02,560 --> 00:07:04,880
preserving exchange between

189
00:07:04,880 --> 00:07:07,919
chains which don't have any notion of

190
00:07:07,919 --> 00:07:08,639
type

191
00:07:08,639 --> 00:07:10,400
so let's assume you have two monaro

192
00:07:10,400 --> 00:07:12,720
chains one for dollars one for euros

193
00:07:12,720 --> 00:07:14,400
then you can do private exchanges

194
00:07:14,400 --> 00:07:15,759
between them but

195
00:07:15,759 --> 00:07:19,360
the metadata alone leaks the

196
00:07:19,360 --> 00:07:21,599
the frequency of transactions within

197
00:07:21,599 --> 00:07:22,560
each system

198
00:07:22,560 --> 00:07:24,560
or within each token and the other

199
00:07:24,560 --> 00:07:25,840
problem is that

200
00:07:25,840 --> 00:07:28,840
deploying a new token is prohibitively

201
00:07:28,840 --> 00:07:30,800
expensive

202
00:07:30,800 --> 00:07:34,639
so let's look at swap ct

203
00:07:34,639 --> 00:07:37,199
the basic features is that it's a utxo

204
00:07:37,199 --> 00:07:37,919
system

205
00:07:37,919 --> 00:07:39,759
which means that each transaction

206
00:07:39,759 --> 00:07:42,160
consumes input and produces outputs

207
00:07:42,160 --> 00:07:44,319
and inputs are references to previous

208
00:07:44,319 --> 00:07:46,560
outputs and once an output is referenced

209
00:07:46,560 --> 00:07:50,000
it's no longer spendable we achieve sena

210
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:51,840
and receive anonymity by breaking the

211
00:07:51,840 --> 00:07:53,280
direct link to which

212
00:07:53,280 --> 00:07:56,319
input is used and

213
00:07:56,319 --> 00:07:58,240
we we have confidential amounts and

214
00:07:58,240 --> 00:07:59,759
confidential types

215
00:07:59,759 --> 00:08:03,280
due to the nice

216
00:08:03,280 --> 00:08:06,879
confidential commitment scheme

217
00:08:06,879 --> 00:08:10,319
so how to build these atomic swap

218
00:08:10,319 --> 00:08:11,280
transactions

219
00:08:11,280 --> 00:08:14,720
let's assume that cuba has three dollars

220
00:08:14,720 --> 00:08:18,000
and wants one euro in return so

221
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:21,199
qr can sign an offer which says i would

222
00:08:21,199 --> 00:08:24,080
authorize to spend my three dollar note

223
00:08:24,080 --> 00:08:24,720
if

224
00:08:24,720 --> 00:08:27,120
somebody returns a one euro note to me

225
00:08:27,120 --> 00:08:28,800
instead

226
00:08:28,800 --> 00:08:31,919
and megan for example can conversely

227
00:08:31,919 --> 00:08:34,958
do the opposite thing and sign it

228
00:08:34,958 --> 00:08:37,120
and says that i will i authorize to

229
00:08:37,120 --> 00:08:39,039
spend my 1 euro input

230
00:08:39,039 --> 00:08:42,799
if i get three dollars back and then

231
00:08:42,799 --> 00:08:46,160
somebody can join both together

232
00:08:46,160 --> 00:08:49,600
and get a more or less balanced

233
00:08:49,600 --> 00:08:50,800
transaction

234
00:08:50,800 --> 00:08:52,720
which is then should be

235
00:08:52,720 --> 00:08:54,720
indistinguishable to a transaction which

236
00:08:54,720 --> 00:08:55,519
is probably

237
00:08:55,519 --> 00:08:58,640
uh created by cubo himself and signed

238
00:08:58,640 --> 00:09:01,920
so we need to do this anonymously so

239
00:09:01,920 --> 00:09:02,800
that

240
00:09:02,800 --> 00:09:05,600
all the uh the sender and recipient

241
00:09:05,600 --> 00:09:06,640
anonymity is

242
00:09:06,640 --> 00:09:09,839
is achieved and for offers it doesn't

243
00:09:09,839 --> 00:09:12,160
really make sense to hide because then

244
00:09:12,160 --> 00:09:15,200
you don't know what you exchange

245
00:09:15,200 --> 00:09:18,320
so there only the the accounts are

246
00:09:18,320 --> 00:09:18,959
hidden but

247
00:09:18,959 --> 00:09:21,680
not the type and value but in a final

248
00:09:21,680 --> 00:09:23,839
transaction they are completely

249
00:09:23,839 --> 00:09:27,040
hidden so you you only need to trust

250
00:09:27,040 --> 00:09:28,720
your exchange to

251
00:09:28,720 --> 00:09:31,519
scrub the values off but the exchange

252
00:09:31,519 --> 00:09:34,160
cannot steal anything for example

253
00:09:34,160 --> 00:09:37,600
so our main work is how does these

254
00:09:37,600 --> 00:09:40,560
uh these aggregateable signatures work

255
00:09:40,560 --> 00:09:42,160
like

256
00:09:42,160 --> 00:09:45,200
and to start this we

257
00:09:45,200 --> 00:09:47,440
assume unlinkable key pairs to the

258
00:09:47,440 --> 00:09:49,519
inputs so each input has a public key

259
00:09:49,519 --> 00:09:51,360
and somebody has the private key to it

260
00:09:51,360 --> 00:09:52,240
so

261
00:09:52,240 --> 00:09:54,560
cuboid has a three dollar input and

262
00:09:54,560 --> 00:09:56,720
megan has the one euro input

263
00:09:56,720 --> 00:09:59,680
and they both both have the respective

264
00:09:59,680 --> 00:10:01,519
secret key for that

265
00:10:01,519 --> 00:10:03,680
they have their message they want to

266
00:10:03,680 --> 00:10:05,839
achieve so q world wants one euro

267
00:10:05,839 --> 00:10:09,200
megan wants the three dollars and they

268
00:10:09,200 --> 00:10:11,200
need to create a signature for the set

269
00:10:11,200 --> 00:10:15,120
of both signed with both secret keys

270
00:10:15,120 --> 00:10:17,600
and in the interactive setting that's

271
00:10:17,600 --> 00:10:18,560
super easy

272
00:10:18,560 --> 00:10:20,160
they just exchange the message to the

273
00:10:20,160 --> 00:10:22,320
other party then they both have the full

274
00:10:22,320 --> 00:10:23,120
set

275
00:10:23,120 --> 00:10:25,519
they sign it with whatever signature

276
00:10:25,519 --> 00:10:26,720
scheme they want

277
00:10:26,720 --> 00:10:28,320
and they just concatenate the two

278
00:10:28,320 --> 00:10:30,480
signatures and

279
00:10:30,480 --> 00:10:32,800
that's fine the non-interactive setting

280
00:10:32,800 --> 00:10:34,560
is way more complicated because

281
00:10:34,560 --> 00:10:37,440
if we just concatenate the signatures uh

282
00:10:37,440 --> 00:10:38,640
the mapping between

283
00:10:38,640 --> 00:10:41,680
who signed for which message in the set

284
00:10:41,680 --> 00:10:44,560
is apparent and that hurts the anonymity

285
00:10:44,560 --> 00:10:46,880
so the anonymity dictates that

286
00:10:46,880 --> 00:10:50,640
it has to be a true multi-signature over

287
00:10:50,640 --> 00:10:53,920
a set of messages and this

288
00:10:53,920 --> 00:10:56,399
is not achievable by signing their

289
00:10:56,399 --> 00:10:58,000
respective messages but

290
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:00,079
what they need to do is they sign they

291
00:11:00,079 --> 00:11:02,079
need a signature which says that

292
00:11:02,079 --> 00:11:04,959
for any set of messages which is a

293
00:11:04,959 --> 00:11:05,680
superset

294
00:11:05,680 --> 00:11:09,440
of my message i'm willing to spend my

295
00:11:09,440 --> 00:11:10,959
input

296
00:11:10,959 --> 00:11:13,680
and then if we concatenate them together

297
00:11:13,680 --> 00:11:15,040
we achieved the

298
00:11:15,040 --> 00:11:17,279
thing so the privacy of that is that the

299
00:11:17,279 --> 00:11:19,040
mapping between

300
00:11:19,040 --> 00:11:21,680
who signed something and which output

301
00:11:21,680 --> 00:11:22,240
message

302
00:11:22,240 --> 00:11:24,959
they wanted is hidden and also the total

303
00:11:24,959 --> 00:11:26,640
number of users is hidden

304
00:11:26,640 --> 00:11:29,120
and this works by sort of the privacy

305
00:11:29,120 --> 00:11:29,920
game for that

306
00:11:29,920 --> 00:11:33,040
the formal one is that um

307
00:11:33,040 --> 00:11:36,240
you just the challenger distributes um

308
00:11:36,240 --> 00:11:39,120
message and key pairs to individuals and

309
00:11:39,120 --> 00:11:39,519
then

310
00:11:39,519 --> 00:11:43,120
challenges them to to differentiate

311
00:11:43,120 --> 00:11:46,079
how their signature was created so how

312
00:11:46,079 --> 00:11:47,360
is this useful

313
00:11:47,360 --> 00:11:50,079
to build a swap transaction or an atomic

314
00:11:50,079 --> 00:11:51,600
swap transaction is

315
00:11:51,600 --> 00:11:54,079
that we have again this so keyword

316
00:11:54,079 --> 00:11:55,600
decides that

317
00:11:55,600 --> 00:11:57,680
there are there there is a previously

318
00:11:57,680 --> 00:11:59,360
received three dollar input

319
00:11:59,360 --> 00:12:02,639
and a one euro output and

320
00:12:02,639 --> 00:12:05,760
cuba signs it with the anonymously

321
00:12:05,760 --> 00:12:07,200
aggregateable signature scheme which

322
00:12:07,200 --> 00:12:08,079
says that

323
00:12:08,079 --> 00:12:11,279
for all messages so all other outputs

324
00:12:11,279 --> 00:12:13,839
which are part of the final transaction

325
00:12:13,839 --> 00:12:16,959
as long as my one euro output is in it

326
00:12:16,959 --> 00:12:20,160
i'm happy to spend my three dollars then

327
00:12:20,160 --> 00:12:21,440
megan does the same

328
00:12:21,440 --> 00:12:25,120
as the inverse we don't need a perfect

329
00:12:25,120 --> 00:12:26,399
fit here because

330
00:12:26,399 --> 00:12:29,839
for example an exchange can add a third

331
00:12:29,839 --> 00:12:30,959
pair

332
00:12:30,959 --> 00:12:34,000
to fix some small issues or pay fees or

333
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:34,720
whatever

334
00:12:34,720 --> 00:12:37,200
so this is arbitrarily expensive

335
00:12:37,200 --> 00:12:38,800
extendable

336
00:12:38,800 --> 00:12:40,800
and once they combine them together they

337
00:12:40,800 --> 00:12:42,160
get a balanced transaction

338
00:12:42,160 --> 00:12:45,279
and this balance transaction then can

339
00:12:45,279 --> 00:12:47,279
aggregate the two signatures together

340
00:12:47,279 --> 00:12:48,880
which then has a valid

341
00:12:48,880 --> 00:12:52,000
spending signatures for both inputs

342
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:55,120
if the set is the superset of both of

343
00:12:55,120 --> 00:12:56,320
them

344
00:12:56,320 --> 00:13:00,160
so how to build such a signature scheme

345
00:13:00,160 --> 00:13:03,279
so the intuition is that

346
00:13:03,279 --> 00:13:06,399
we have a set of secret keys to sign and

347
00:13:06,399 --> 00:13:07,760
a set of messages

348
00:13:07,760 --> 00:13:10,000
we want to sign but we don't want to

349
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:11,200
create a link and

350
00:13:11,200 --> 00:13:13,120
the signatures are created by multiple

351
00:13:13,120 --> 00:13:15,360
different parties

352
00:13:15,360 --> 00:13:17,760
so the important feature is that no

353
00:13:17,760 --> 00:13:20,959
verification of any subset must be valid

354
00:13:20,959 --> 00:13:24,800
must be valid so only if you verify all

355
00:13:24,800 --> 00:13:25,680
of them you

356
00:13:25,680 --> 00:13:29,839
get all of them and then

357
00:13:29,839 --> 00:13:32,079
what we do is we replace the messages by

358
00:13:32,079 --> 00:13:33,040
proxies

359
00:13:33,040 --> 00:13:35,680
and we sign some random values and we

360
00:13:35,680 --> 00:13:37,360
make sure that the random values and the

361
00:13:37,360 --> 00:13:38,320
proxies

362
00:13:38,320 --> 00:13:41,199
are equal and then if we hide all the

363
00:13:41,199 --> 00:13:42,959
proxies and random values

364
00:13:42,959 --> 00:13:45,920
and show in zero knowledge that they're

365
00:13:45,920 --> 00:13:46,399
equal

366
00:13:46,399 --> 00:13:50,079
then we can verify that without

367
00:13:50,079 --> 00:13:53,519
being able to verify any partial subsets

368
00:13:53,519 --> 00:13:55,360
so the building blocks are all standard

369
00:13:55,360 --> 00:13:56,639
assumptions

370
00:13:56,639 --> 00:13:59,920
um it is quite versatile so the way we

371
00:13:59,920 --> 00:14:00,720
describe it

372
00:14:00,720 --> 00:14:03,519
is that you can use whatever signature

373
00:14:03,519 --> 00:14:05,600
scheme you want and we formalized it for

374
00:14:05,600 --> 00:14:07,519
a generic signature of knowledge for

375
00:14:07,519 --> 00:14:07,839
some

376
00:14:07,839 --> 00:14:11,440
np language and for one example is that

377
00:14:11,440 --> 00:14:15,600
you can do a standard schnorr style

378
00:14:15,600 --> 00:14:17,199
signature of knowledge which is like

379
00:14:17,199 --> 00:14:18,800
knowledge of the secret key to a blubber

380
00:14:18,800 --> 00:14:20,240
key

381
00:14:20,240 --> 00:14:22,079
if you want anonymity you can do a ring

382
00:14:22,079 --> 00:14:23,360
signature so you know

383
00:14:23,360 --> 00:14:25,760
one secret key in a set of public keys

384
00:14:25,760 --> 00:14:27,760
or you can do even the linkable ring

385
00:14:27,760 --> 00:14:29,600
signature which is the

386
00:14:29,600 --> 00:14:33,279
thing we do so why is it all secure

387
00:14:33,279 --> 00:14:35,920
so the soundness comes from the

388
00:14:35,920 --> 00:14:38,240
simulator and the extractor of the

389
00:14:38,240 --> 00:14:41,440
signatures of knowledge and

390
00:14:41,440 --> 00:14:43,920
then it reduces to the binding property

391
00:14:43,920 --> 00:14:46,480
of the commitments

392
00:14:46,480 --> 00:14:49,199
the simulated simulatability holds

393
00:14:49,199 --> 00:14:49,760
because

394
00:14:49,760 --> 00:14:53,199
the witness is only used in the

395
00:14:53,199 --> 00:14:55,279
signature of knowledge for the actual

396
00:14:55,279 --> 00:14:57,120
signing so

397
00:14:57,120 --> 00:14:59,680
our wrapper does not have any secret

398
00:14:59,680 --> 00:15:01,360
input

399
00:15:01,360 --> 00:15:04,560
and the privacy holds because

400
00:15:04,560 --> 00:15:08,160
the union of two fields of

401
00:15:08,160 --> 00:15:12,880
two sets is indistinguishable on how the

402
00:15:12,880 --> 00:15:16,320
how the set was created and the addition

403
00:15:16,320 --> 00:15:18,399
in the field is also

404
00:15:18,399 --> 00:15:22,079
perfectly hiding so thereby

405
00:15:22,079 --> 00:15:24,560
the mapping between inputs and outputs

406
00:15:24,560 --> 00:15:26,800
is hidden

407
00:15:26,800 --> 00:15:29,839
so far we

408
00:15:29,839 --> 00:15:32,959
we showed that how to build these

409
00:15:32,959 --> 00:15:36,160
aggregateable signatures such that the

410
00:15:36,160 --> 00:15:37,759
inputs

411
00:15:37,759 --> 00:15:41,360
are only spendable if all messages

412
00:15:41,360 --> 00:15:44,000
of the required subset are in the final

413
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:44,880
transaction

414
00:15:44,880 --> 00:15:47,920
message set and that works

415
00:15:47,920 --> 00:15:50,079
even indistinguishability in

416
00:15:50,079 --> 00:15:52,160
indistinguishable from

417
00:15:52,160 --> 00:15:55,199
full transactions so you can only also

418
00:15:55,199 --> 00:15:56,639
create these as a single

419
00:15:56,639 --> 00:15:58,480
participant and then they are not

420
00:15:58,480 --> 00:15:59,920
differentiable if

421
00:15:59,920 --> 00:16:04,560
they were aggregated or created directly

422
00:16:04,560 --> 00:16:06,240
there are more features we need to

423
00:16:06,240 --> 00:16:08,800
achieve the full swap ct system

424
00:16:08,800 --> 00:16:11,680
and we describe them in our paper which

425
00:16:11,680 --> 00:16:12,399
is sender

426
00:16:12,399 --> 00:16:14,720
anonymity which is achieved to a ring so

427
00:16:14,720 --> 00:16:15,759
the signature is

428
00:16:15,759 --> 00:16:18,880
an actual linkable ring signature

429
00:16:18,880 --> 00:16:21,279
then we need receiver anonymity which is

430
00:16:21,279 --> 00:16:23,680
achieved through on-time addresses

431
00:16:23,680 --> 00:16:26,639
and value and type confidentiality which

432
00:16:26,639 --> 00:16:27,040
is

433
00:16:27,040 --> 00:16:28,639
done through commitments and as

434
00:16:28,639 --> 00:16:30,320
knowledge proof that the commitments are

435
00:16:30,320 --> 00:16:31,839
balanced

436
00:16:31,839 --> 00:16:35,040
so to show that it's

437
00:16:35,040 --> 00:16:38,320
actually applicable we implemented it uh

438
00:16:38,320 --> 00:16:41,920
you know like not um

439
00:16:41,920 --> 00:16:44,560
in in not only the the bulletproof

440
00:16:44,560 --> 00:16:45,600
timing

441
00:16:45,600 --> 00:16:49,040
measurement but we try to to get

442
00:16:49,040 --> 00:16:51,759
a full transaction system so we can say

443
00:16:51,759 --> 00:16:54,240
like here is a transaction please verify

444
00:16:54,240 --> 00:16:57,920
um with these reference inputs

445
00:16:57,920 --> 00:17:00,720
and then we achieved very comparable

446
00:17:00,720 --> 00:17:01,600
numbers to

447
00:17:01,600 --> 00:17:05,199
the monero implementation which is based

448
00:17:05,199 --> 00:17:05,520
on

449
00:17:05,520 --> 00:17:08,559
years of performance tweaks so

450
00:17:08,559 --> 00:17:11,359
we already achieved quite a good

451
00:17:11,359 --> 00:17:12,160
performance

452
00:17:12,160 --> 00:17:14,559
for the the setting we wanted and we are

453
00:17:14,559 --> 00:17:16,839
super happy with that and we plan to

454
00:17:16,839 --> 00:17:19,919
continue improving it so far

455
00:17:19,919 --> 00:17:22,400
so good thanks for your attention and

456
00:17:22,400 --> 00:17:22,959
i'm

457
00:17:22,959 --> 00:17:27,120
very happy to take questions
