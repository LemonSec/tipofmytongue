you to bring your own ideas we encourage

32
00:01:09,040 --> 00:01:10,240
the speakers to

33
00:01:10,240 --> 00:01:12,880
pose questions we encourage lively

34
00:01:12,880 --> 00:01:15,360
debate joking around etc it's not

35
00:01:15,360 --> 00:01:17,360
formal like the conference question and

36
00:01:17,360 --> 00:01:19,040
answer period so

37
00:01:19,040 --> 00:01:21,600
if you have anything even remotely

38
00:01:21,600 --> 00:01:22,720
intelligent to say

39
00:01:22,720 --> 00:01:24,560
on the subjects that were talked about

40
00:01:24,560 --> 00:01:26,080
it doesn't have to be directly related

41
00:01:26,080 --> 00:01:28,240
to what the speakers said please please

42
00:01:28,240 --> 00:01:29,680

50
00:01:47,360 --> 00:01:48,960
coffee that's usually my favorite part

51
00:01:48,960 --> 00:01:50,079
of conferences but

52
00:01:50,079 --> 00:01:51,920
uh will give you a chance to go brew

53
00:01:51,920 --> 00:01:55,040
some of your own and then we have a very

54
00:01:55,040 --> 00:01:55,840
exciting

55
00:01:55,840 --> 00:01:58,960

authorities what is the a's yeah perfect

60
00:02:09,440 --> 00:02:10,959
is the enemy the good talking about the

61
00:02:10,959 --> 00:02:12,400
interplay between

62
00:02:12,400 --> 00:02:14,560
regulation and regulators and the sorts

63
00:02:14,560 --> 00:02:16,560
of technologies that we all spend our

64
00:02:16,560 --> 00:02:19,120
days obsessing about

65
00:02:19,120 --> 00:02:20,400
then we'll have another short break

66
00:02:20,400 --> 00:02:22,720
followed by the third session or the

67
00:02:22,720 --> 00:02:24,239
second session the last session of the

68
00:02:24,239 --> 00:02:25,920
day which has got three more talks

69
00:02:25,920 --> 00:02:29,440
same basic idea as the first session

70
00:02:29,440 --> 00:02:34,160
and then in the regular hot pets uh

71
00:02:34,160 --> 00:02:36,959
tradition we are going to have a vote

72
00:02:36,959 --> 00:02:38,239
for the best

73
00:02:38,239 --> 00:02:40,800
talk so we'll be using this mentee

74
00:02:40,800 --> 00:02:41,440
website

75
00:02:41,440 --> 00:02:43,040
we'll we'll provide this information

76
00:02:43,040 --> 00:02:44,800
again when it's actually time but

77
00:02:44,800 --> 00:02:47,120
you enter this code you give your vote

78
00:02:47,120 --> 00:02:49,440
and whichever talk gets the most

79
00:02:49,440 --> 00:02:52,560
votes will win a prize

80
00:02:52,560 --> 00:02:54,720
and so we'll we'll discuss that with the

81
00:02:54,720 --> 00:02:55,840
presenter after

82
00:02:55,840 --> 00:02:59,280
because of the virtual nature of this we

83
00:02:59,280 --> 00:03:02,319
have to send the prize to the um

84
00:03:02,319 --> 00:03:03,760
to the presenter so there will be a bit

85
00:03:03,760 --> 00:03:05,360
of a delay but

86
00:03:05,360 --> 00:03:08,800
um be prepared to vote for your favorite

87
00:03:08,800 --> 00:03:13,040
by whatever criteria you deem fit

88
00:03:13,040 --> 00:03:15,120
and then we will all convene you may

89
00:03:15,120 --> 00:03:16,159
have noticed

90
00:03:16,159 --> 00:03:18,319
the very bottom of gather town there is

91
00:03:18,319 --> 00:03:19,760
an ice cream bar

92
00:03:19,760 --> 00:03:22,000
again much like the coffee this year

93
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:23,519
you're forced to bring your own ice

94
00:03:23,519 --> 00:03:24,159
cream

95
00:03:24,159 --> 00:03:25,760
hopefully you've all got some stashed

96
00:03:25,760 --> 00:03:27,200
away in your freezer

97
00:03:27,200 --> 00:03:29,840
and uh we'll hang around and eat ice

98
00:03:29,840 --> 00:03:31,519
cream and continue to talk

99
00:03:31,519 --> 00:03:34,319
pets or whatever we feel like talking

100
00:03:34,319 --> 00:03:35,440
about

101
00:03:35,440 --> 00:03:38,480
so with that i will hand the floor

102
00:03:38,480 --> 00:03:47,280
over to our first speaker mona

103
00:03:47,280 --> 00:03:51,519

106
00:04:03,439 --> 00:04:04,239
introduction

107
00:04:04,239 --> 00:04:06,640
ryan uh that was great uh hi everybody

108
00:04:06,640 --> 00:04:08,480
i'm mona i'm a graduate student at

109
00:04:08,480 --> 00:04:10,159
princeton university and thank you to

110
00:04:10,159 --> 00:04:12,080
hot pets for having me i'm excited to be

111
00:04:12,080 --> 00:04:12,959
here

112
00:04:12,959 --> 00:04:14,799
i'm sorry for the mess in the background

113
00:04:14,799 --> 00:04:16,639
i'm moving right now

114
00:04:16,639 --> 00:04:18,320
but i'm excited to be presenting here

115
00:04:18,320 --> 00:04:19,918
instead of packing

116
00:04:19,918 --> 00:04:22,639
so today i'm going to be talking about

117
00:04:22,639 --> 00:04:24,160
leveraging connection migration for

118
00:04:24,160 --> 00:04:25,199
network privacy

119
00:04:25,199 --> 00:04:27,759
also known as comps my very cool and

120
00:04:27,759 --> 00:04:29,840
very legitimate acronym

121
00:04:29,840 --> 00:04:32,800
uh so let's talk about pets i love

122
00:04:32,800 --> 00:04:33,680
privacy

123
00:04:33,680 --> 00:04:36,160
enhancing technologies i love animals my

124
00:04:36,160 --> 00:04:38,000
parents were unfortunately

125
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:41,040
allergic so i never had pets growing up

126
00:04:41,040 --> 00:04:42,880
it was because of that that in my youth

127
00:04:42,880 --> 00:04:44,800
i was severely addicted

128
00:04:44,800 --> 00:04:47,360
to a gaming website called neopets that

129
00:04:47,360 --> 00:04:49,040
lets you care for virtual pets and play

130
00:04:49,040 --> 00:04:50,000
games with them

131
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:52,320
unfortunately my legal adult guardian

132
00:04:52,320 --> 00:04:53,840
depicted here by this

133
00:04:53,840 --> 00:04:56,080
disembodied eyeball emoji thought my

134
00:04:56,080 --> 00:04:57,440
addiction to neopets

135
00:04:57,440 --> 00:04:59,680
and the internet in general was morally

136
00:04:59,680 --> 00:05:00,800
objectionable

137
00:05:00,800 --> 00:05:03,199
which like maybe and also bad for my

138
00:05:03,199 --> 00:05:04,240
developmental health

139
00:05:04,240 --> 00:05:06,880
which is probably very true um and so as

140
00:05:06,880 --> 00:05:07,680
many of you

141
00:05:07,680 --> 00:05:08,960
probably already know there are lots of

142
00:05:08,960 --> 00:05:11,360
ways unfortunately your regular internet

143
00:05:11,360 --> 00:05:11,919
usage

144
00:05:11,919 --> 00:05:14,560
is not at all private um it will reel

145
00:05:14,560 --> 00:05:16,080
what you're doing to anyone on the

146
00:05:16,080 --> 00:05:17,360
network listening

147
00:05:17,360 --> 00:05:19,039
for instance a parent that runs your

148
00:05:19,039 --> 00:05:21,199
home router so unfortunately

149
00:05:21,199 --> 00:05:22,639
it was quite easy to put parental

150
00:05:22,639 --> 00:05:24,639
controls on the router and foil my

151
00:05:24,639 --> 00:05:27,280
gaming experience and also my use

152
00:05:27,280 --> 00:05:30,240
um so whenever i got blocked i would be

153
00:05:30,240 --> 00:05:31,120
very sad

154
00:05:31,120 --> 00:05:34,400
because i could not feed my fairy cow

155
00:05:34,400 --> 00:05:36,080
so i did what any desperate

156
00:05:36,080 --> 00:05:37,680
eight-year-olds would do in the early

157
00:05:37,680 --> 00:05:39,919
2000s which was to ask my friend

158
00:05:39,919 --> 00:05:43,199
jeeves about it luckily jeeves actually

159
00:05:43,199 --> 00:05:44,880
had great advice

160
00:05:44,880 --> 00:05:48,160
he told me to use vpn i used tor

161
00:05:48,160 --> 00:05:50,240
and armed with this new information and

162
00:05:50,240 --> 00:05:51,520
this new technology

163
00:05:51,520 --> 00:05:53,680
i was able to feed my cow and freely

164
00:05:53,680 --> 00:05:55,840
surf the web and it was glorious

165
00:05:55,840 --> 00:05:59,199
for this period of time however

166
00:05:59,199 --> 00:06:01,840
my legal adult guardian only got smarter

167
00:06:01,840 --> 00:06:03,759
they realized that even if my connection

168
00:06:03,759 --> 00:06:04,319
wasn't

169
00:06:04,319 --> 00:06:06,560
encrypted it turns out the sizes and the

170
00:06:06,560 --> 00:06:08,240
timing schedule of packets

171
00:06:08,240 --> 00:06:10,560
is enough to fully identify the website

172
00:06:10,560 --> 00:06:11,360
i was visiting

173
00:06:11,360 --> 00:06:13,360
so they memorized the general packet

174
00:06:13,360 --> 00:06:14,960
timing and sizes

175
00:06:14,960 --> 00:06:16,720
that the network would experience when i

176
00:06:16,720 --> 00:06:18,639
opened neopets and they would block the

177
00:06:18,639 --> 00:06:20,560
connection whenever it occurred

178
00:06:20,560 --> 00:06:22,080
so it turns out that today this is

179
00:06:22,080 --> 00:06:23,759
actually a whole subfield of

180
00:06:23,759 --> 00:06:25,919
cs network privacy research called

181
00:06:25,919 --> 00:06:28,160
website fingerprinting

182
00:06:28,160 --> 00:06:29,840
so state-of-the-art fingerprinting

183
00:06:29,840 --> 00:06:31,840
classifiers you know nowadays

184
00:06:31,840 --> 00:06:33,600
are using complex neural networks to

185
00:06:33,600 --> 00:06:34,880
discriminate between hundreds of

186
00:06:34,880 --> 00:06:36,080
websites

187
00:06:36,080 --> 00:06:38,880
um you know like convolutional networks

188
00:06:38,880 --> 00:06:39,759
and they even what

189
00:06:39,759 --> 00:06:41,919
work well in the context where you

190
00:06:41,919 --> 00:06:43,280
experience

191
00:06:43,280 --> 00:06:46,080
unknown or not before seen traffic or

192
00:06:46,080 --> 00:06:47,280
websites

193
00:06:47,280 --> 00:06:49,840
uh and you know even non-neural network

194
00:06:49,840 --> 00:06:51,680
classifiers work pretty well there's

195
00:06:51,680 --> 00:06:53,680
okay fingerprinting which uses manually

196
00:06:53,680 --> 00:06:55,120
engineered features with

197
00:06:55,120 --> 00:06:57,039
random decision force that works quite

198
00:06:57,039 --> 00:06:58,720
well

199
00:06:58,720 --> 00:07:02,319
and so you know like in the face of

200
00:07:02,319 --> 00:07:03,919
machine learning driven network

201
00:07:03,919 --> 00:07:05,840
surveillance attacks i was completely

202
00:07:05,840 --> 00:07:06,720
defeated

203
00:07:06,720 --> 00:07:08,240
uh by my legal adult guardian and

204
00:07:08,240 --> 00:07:09,919
there's nothing i could do so for now

205
00:07:09,919 --> 00:07:10,639
we're going to

206
00:07:10,639 --> 00:07:12,400
elegantly segue into talking about

207
00:07:12,400 --> 00:07:15,120
modern encryption and network protocols

208
00:07:15,120 --> 00:07:17,280
this is their site banner as of now i i

209
00:07:17,280 --> 00:07:18,639
think uh i think

210
00:07:18,639 --> 00:07:20,479
this you know this is a really smart

211
00:07:20,479 --> 00:07:22,080
move global smartphone

212
00:07:22,080 --> 00:07:24,720
penetration is almost 80 and everyone

213
00:07:24,720 --> 00:07:25,440
has a phone

214
00:07:25,440 --> 00:07:28,240
so in practice what does this mean for

215
00:07:28,240 --> 00:07:29,280
me

216
00:07:29,280 --> 00:07:31,199
well this just means that i'm i'm going

217
00:07:31,199 --> 00:07:32,880
to be browsing neopets on my mobile

218
00:07:32,880 --> 00:07:34,240
phone

219
00:07:34,240 --> 00:07:35,840
these days my phone and your phones

220
00:07:35,840 --> 00:07:38,479
probably also are real estate moguls

221
00:07:38,479 --> 00:07:39,840
they have not one

222
00:07:39,840 --> 00:07:41,680
often but two network addresses on the

223
00:07:41,680 --> 00:07:43,120
internet one through your wi-fi one

224
00:07:43,120 --> 00:07:44,479
through your mobile provider

225
00:07:44,479 --> 00:07:46,800
and the tcp based internet moving

226
00:07:46,800 --> 00:07:48,000
between network addresses is very

227
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:48,560
annoying

228
00:07:48,560 --> 00:07:50,479
right when you walk outside your wi-fi

229
00:07:50,479 --> 00:07:52,240
range your phone such as data

230
00:07:52,240 --> 00:07:55,199
tcp connections uh have to get dropped

231
00:07:55,199 --> 00:07:56,319
and restarted on the new

232
00:07:56,319 --> 00:07:58,160
network because they're so tied to the

233
00:07:58,160 --> 00:07:59,360
network address

234
00:07:59,360 --> 00:08:00,879
these kind of network changes also

235
00:08:00,879 --> 00:08:02,319
happen when you're not moving if your

236
00:08:02,319 --> 00:08:04,000
mobile map just decides

237
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:06,000
to change or rebind your phone's ip

238
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:07,599
address

239
00:08:07,599 --> 00:08:10,319
so luckily many modern udp based

240
00:08:10,319 --> 00:08:11,599
encryption protocols are network

241
00:08:11,599 --> 00:08:13,039
agnostic so

242
00:08:13,039 --> 00:08:15,280
uh you know in other words unlike tcp

243
00:08:15,280 --> 00:08:17,440
which tightly couples connections

244
00:08:17,440 --> 00:08:19,919
to individual network addresses from any

245
00:08:19,919 --> 00:08:22,400
udp-based encryption protocols

246
00:08:22,400 --> 00:08:24,160
the connections are not defined by the

247
00:08:24,160 --> 00:08:26,000
address but by some other data so just

248
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:28,000
the negotiated key pair or a proxy for

249
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:28,639
it

250
00:08:28,639 --> 00:08:31,039
the biggest one is quick which was just

251
00:08:31,039 --> 00:08:32,159
made into an rfc

252
00:08:32,159 --> 00:08:34,320
i i think like maybe a couple months ago

253
00:08:34,320 --> 00:08:36,320
i don't i don't know

254
00:08:36,320 --> 00:08:38,000
and is really rapidly gaining support

255
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:39,919
it's going to be the sole transport for

256
00:08:39,919 --> 00:08:41,120
http 3.

257
00:08:41,120 --> 00:08:43,120
it supports connection migration uh

258
00:08:43,120 --> 00:08:44,399
there's also

259
00:08:44,399 --> 00:08:45,920
protocols like wireguard and mosh that

260
00:08:45,920 --> 00:08:48,080
both support ip roaming you know as long

261
00:08:48,080 --> 00:08:48,399
as

262
00:08:48,399 --> 00:08:50,080
the received packet is valid you know

263
00:08:50,080 --> 00:08:53,760
the server or the end will accept it

264
00:08:53,760 --> 00:08:56,080
and so to be a little pedantic this is

265
00:08:56,080 --> 00:08:57,440
what such a migration

266
00:08:57,440 --> 00:08:59,279
might look like you know in particular

267
00:08:59,279 --> 00:09:01,440
for quick uh you know at some point

268
00:09:01,440 --> 00:09:04,000
our device will change the network uh

269
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:04,480
and

270
00:09:04,480 --> 00:09:06,080
they'll detect the change number maybe

271
00:09:06,080 --> 00:09:08,880
rebind you know the socket onto the new

272
00:09:08,880 --> 00:09:10,880
uh on a to a new port and then send data

273
00:09:10,880 --> 00:09:12,640
from the new network address

274
00:09:12,640 --> 00:09:14,959
and so long as the server is confident

275
00:09:14,959 --> 00:09:16,480
that it comes from the same endpoint

276
00:09:16,480 --> 00:09:18,080
it'll accept data

277
00:09:18,080 --> 00:09:20,080
even in the middle of a session so one

278
00:09:20,080 --> 00:09:21,200
gotcha in

279
00:09:21,200 --> 00:09:23,519
is not in quick the protocol requires a

280
00:09:23,519 --> 00:09:25,279
two-way reachability to be established

281
00:09:25,279 --> 00:09:26,880
first so there's this probe

282
00:09:26,880 --> 00:09:30,160
uh before accepting more data on a new

283
00:09:30,160 --> 00:09:30,959
network path

284
00:09:30,959 --> 00:09:33,120
uh in practice path validations can also

285
00:09:33,120 --> 00:09:35,200
be cached we're gonna talk more about

286
00:09:35,200 --> 00:09:37,839
the sort of practicalities of quick

287
00:09:37,839 --> 00:09:38,880
connection migration if you're

288
00:09:38,880 --> 00:09:40,560
interested in the discussion

289
00:09:40,560 --> 00:09:44,000
um but we've sort of established what

290
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:45,760
connection migration is i hope at this

291
00:09:45,760 --> 00:09:47,200
point so

292
00:09:47,200 --> 00:09:49,040
now let's talk about what comps is what

293
00:09:49,040 --> 00:09:50,640
is what is cups

294
00:09:50,640 --> 00:09:52,160
and so the primitive here and the

295
00:09:52,160 --> 00:09:53,839
intuition cool intuition is that we can

296
00:09:53,839 --> 00:09:55,120
split a session in the middle

297
00:09:55,120 --> 00:09:56,800
of a network connection this breaks a

298
00:09:56,800 --> 00:09:59,040
lot of assumptions that network control

299
00:09:59,040 --> 00:10:00,399
devices currently rely

300
00:10:00,399 --> 00:10:03,839
very heavily on devices like parental

301
00:10:03,839 --> 00:10:05,120
control so let's go back to our

302
00:10:05,120 --> 00:10:06,399
adversary who's

303
00:10:06,399 --> 00:10:08,000
using a machine learning to determine

304
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:10,160
when i'm visiting neopets

305
00:10:10,160 --> 00:10:11,760
and using this insight you know for the

306
00:10:11,760 --> 00:10:13,440
same individual connection

307
00:10:13,440 --> 00:10:15,440
i'm making to the near pets home page i

308
00:10:15,440 --> 00:10:16,560
can send packets from different

309
00:10:16,560 --> 00:10:17,360
addresses

310
00:10:17,360 --> 00:10:18,959
supposing you put support something like

311
00:10:18,959 --> 00:10:20,480
quick this would work

312
00:10:20,480 --> 00:10:24,320
um and uh some intuition as to why

313
00:10:24,320 --> 00:10:27,760
this might foil uh even advanced

314
00:10:27,760 --> 00:10:30,800
fingerprinting defenses or attacks

315
00:10:30,800 --> 00:10:33,440
until recently a lot of defenses against

316
00:10:33,440 --> 00:10:34,399
web fingerprinting

317
00:10:34,399 --> 00:10:36,640
often involve obfuscating the size and

318
00:10:36,640 --> 00:10:38,560
timing information by you know

319
00:10:38,560 --> 00:10:41,279
injecting dummy packets or standardizing

320
00:10:41,279 --> 00:10:42,399
packet sizes

321
00:10:42,399 --> 00:10:44,480
uh the comps kind of depends and other

322
00:10:44,480 --> 00:10:46,560
recent web fingerprinting defense

323
00:10:46,560 --> 00:10:48,640
is involved lowering the amount of

324
00:10:48,640 --> 00:10:50,720
actual information the adversary can

325
00:10:50,720 --> 00:10:51,519
learn

326
00:10:51,519 --> 00:10:53,360
so now the adversary has more problems

327
00:10:53,360 --> 00:10:55,040
to solve right beyond just

328
00:10:55,040 --> 00:10:57,200
what is the network fingerprint and you

329
00:10:57,200 --> 00:10:58,480
know what are the possible ways they

330
00:10:58,480 --> 00:10:59,600
could slice it how are they going to

331
00:10:59,600 --> 00:11:00,000
sample

332
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:02,320
from the network fingerprint and then

333
00:11:02,320 --> 00:11:03,760
they also have less information to

334
00:11:03,760 --> 00:11:04,560
determine

335
00:11:04,560 --> 00:11:06,720
what the network fingerprint is in the

336
00:11:06,720 --> 00:11:08,800
first place so

337
00:11:08,800 --> 00:11:10,800
there's also a sort of combinatorial

338
00:11:10,800 --> 00:11:13,680
explosion of the slices

339
00:11:13,680 --> 00:11:15,600
but what if i'm not multi-homed right a

340
00:11:15,600 --> 00:11:17,440
cool thing with about comps

341
00:11:17,440 --> 00:11:18,959
is that i can utilize different

342
00:11:18,959 --> 00:11:20,560
encrypted protocols over the same

343
00:11:20,560 --> 00:11:21,200
network

344
00:11:21,200 --> 00:11:22,880
as long as the packets are delivered to

345
00:11:22,880 --> 00:11:24,640
the intended destination and also routed

346
00:11:24,640 --> 00:11:24,959
back

347
00:11:24,959 --> 00:11:26,720
accordingly so here i'm showing two

348
00:11:26,720 --> 00:11:28,640
different vpns but we can imagine one of

349
00:11:28,640 --> 00:11:29,279
these is

350
00:11:29,279 --> 00:11:31,360
you know maybe just a regular encrypted

351
00:11:31,360 --> 00:11:32,560
quick transport

352
00:11:32,560 --> 00:11:36,560
or another encrypted proxy you know it's

353
00:11:36,560 --> 00:11:38,720
up to you it's your imagination on the

354
00:11:38,720 --> 00:11:40,079
wire format you know

355
00:11:40,079 --> 00:11:41,839
even if the adversary can see all the

356
00:11:41,839 --> 00:11:43,360
traffic uh

357
00:11:43,360 --> 00:11:45,440
it can sort of make the correlation of

358
00:11:45,440 --> 00:11:47,120
the same flow more difficult

359
00:11:47,120 --> 00:11:48,880
we also have the extra problem to solve

360
00:11:48,880 --> 00:11:50,240
you know what are the ways the client

361
00:11:50,240 --> 00:11:51,760
could splice the connection here

362
00:11:51,760 --> 00:11:53,360
i think intuitively this is maybe less

363
00:11:53,360 --> 00:11:56,160
strong than the previous one

364
00:11:56,160 --> 00:11:57,920
but we can also combine the two right if

365
00:11:57,920 --> 00:11:59,279
this doesn't convince you

366
00:11:59,279 --> 00:12:00,880
not only are we using different paths

367
00:12:00,880 --> 00:12:02,399
but also different protocols and so on

368
00:12:02,399 --> 00:12:03,440
the wire

369
00:12:03,440 --> 00:12:06,480
uh it might look something like

370
00:12:06,480 --> 00:12:08,480
this we have different protocols being

371
00:12:08,480 --> 00:12:10,000
sent down different paths

372
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:11,600
you could also limit one protocol to a

373
00:12:11,600 --> 00:12:14,240
single path it's up to you

374
00:12:14,240 --> 00:12:16,880
and so one valid you know complaint or

375
00:12:16,880 --> 00:12:17,519
gripe

376
00:12:17,519 --> 00:12:19,200
might be you know neopets doesn't

377
00:12:19,200 --> 00:12:21,279
default to https yet

378
00:12:21,279 --> 00:12:22,800
uh you know what makes you think they'll

379
00:12:22,800 --> 00:12:24,720
support quick anytime soon

380
00:12:24,720 --> 00:12:26,880
that's okay yeah that's true like we

381
00:12:26,880 --> 00:12:28,560
mentioned before we have other encrypted

382
00:12:28,560 --> 00:12:30,399
udp protocols like wireguard that also

383
00:12:30,399 --> 00:12:32,399
support ip roaming so we can do all of

384
00:12:32,399 --> 00:12:33,600
the tricks that we mentioned

385
00:12:33,600 --> 00:12:36,160
the past five six slides but instead of

386
00:12:36,160 --> 00:12:37,760
connecting directly to neopets we can

387
00:12:37,760 --> 00:12:38,000
just

388
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:41,040
connect to a regular unaltered instance

389
00:12:41,040 --> 00:12:43,839
of regard

390
00:12:44,160 --> 00:12:46,240
and so here's a quick summary of all of

391
00:12:46,240 --> 00:12:47,680
the things we've learned so far

392
00:12:47,680 --> 00:12:49,680
so with comps we have this primitive

393
00:12:49,680 --> 00:12:50,720
this powerful

394
00:12:50,720 --> 00:12:52,959
primitive involving mid-sessions

395
00:12:52,959 --> 00:12:53,920
splitting

396
00:12:53,920 --> 00:12:56,160
we can split across different network

397
00:12:56,160 --> 00:12:57,680
paths uh different

398
00:12:57,680 --> 00:12:59,279
sort of encrypted protocols you know as

399
00:12:59,279 --> 00:13:00,880
long as the packets get delivered

400
00:13:00,880 --> 00:13:03,440
uh to the end point uh as long as the

401
00:13:03,440 --> 00:13:04,079
end point

402
00:13:04,079 --> 00:13:05,839
is you know a connection migration

403
00:13:05,839 --> 00:13:07,839
endpoint and there's minimal overhead we

404
00:13:07,839 --> 00:13:09,040
can also talk about that in the

405
00:13:09,040 --> 00:13:09,920
discussion a bit

406
00:13:09,920 --> 00:13:11,279
as well we don't really get into that

407
00:13:11,279 --> 00:13:13,040
here um

408
00:13:13,040 --> 00:13:15,040
that's pretty cool and so i'm going to

409
00:13:15,040 --> 00:13:16,480
break up the

410
00:13:16,480 --> 00:13:17,920
talk a little bit because it's very

411
00:13:17,920 --> 00:13:19,440
early where i am i don't know about you

412
00:13:19,440 --> 00:13:20,959
all

413
00:13:20,959 --> 00:13:22,880
and with a little demo it's nothing

414
00:13:22,880 --> 00:13:24,399
special it's just gonna show the

415
00:13:24,399 --> 00:13:25,839
connection migration

416
00:13:25,839 --> 00:13:29,600
uh so we're going to be

417
00:13:29,600 --> 00:13:32,959
taking a look at sort of this model and

418
00:13:32,959 --> 00:13:34,160
so what we'll see

419
00:13:34,160 --> 00:13:36,079
is we'll have pcp dump sort of listening

420
00:13:36,079 --> 00:13:38,000
on the two interfaces of the client and

421
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:38,720
then

422
00:13:38,720 --> 00:13:40,720
we'll run a very simple you know path

423
00:13:40,720 --> 00:13:42,399
scheduling packet scheduling

424
00:13:42,399 --> 00:13:46,000
um on the client as well to split

425
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:49,120
between the pads and so it

426
00:13:49,120 --> 00:13:52,160
should just be able to

427
00:13:52,160 --> 00:13:55,920
remove this here

428
00:13:56,480 --> 00:14:00,000
um all right and here so we'll have

429
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:03,120
here i'll uh stick it up here

430
00:14:03,120 --> 00:14:06,560
on the

431
00:14:06,560 --> 00:14:08,959
well let's do let's do uvp only because

432
00:14:08,959 --> 00:14:11,359
sometimes

433
00:14:12,720 --> 00:14:15,760
oh what's going on all right and then

434
00:14:15,760 --> 00:14:16,480
you see

435
00:14:16,480 --> 00:14:21,920
here on the f0 interface

436
00:14:25,040 --> 00:14:29,120
let's open a website on the client

437
00:14:29,279 --> 00:14:32,240
you can sort of see

438
00:14:35,760 --> 00:14:38,240
huh i think i think something's gone

439
00:14:38,240 --> 00:14:41,360
wrong never do live demos friends

440
00:14:41,360 --> 00:14:44,079
oh this is capturing the vnc traffic i'm

441
00:14:44,079 --> 00:14:46,399
sorry

442
00:14:50,560 --> 00:14:54,000
there we go so refresh here we can see

443
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:56,320
all the wireguard traffic or vpn traffic

444
00:14:56,320 --> 00:14:57,360
going through

445
00:14:57,360 --> 00:15:00,639
uh zero uh nothing's going on uh we can

446
00:15:00,639 --> 00:15:04,079
just run a really simple vibrate

447
00:15:04,079 --> 00:15:06,720
script here uh and this will basically

448
00:15:06,720 --> 00:15:07,920
just you know alternate

449
00:15:07,920 --> 00:15:12,880
interfaces you know five times a second

450
00:15:12,880 --> 00:15:15,680
and then we run here we can see the

451
00:15:15,680 --> 00:15:16,240
traffic

452
00:15:16,240 --> 00:15:17,839
just sort of bouncing between the two

453
00:15:17,839 --> 00:15:21,199
interfaces um

454
00:15:22,320 --> 00:15:24,639
successfully visit neopets.com it's got

455
00:15:24,639 --> 00:15:26,000
mobile and so have we

456
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:28,160
evidently alright so that's it that's

457
00:15:28,160 --> 00:15:29,279
that's the demo

458
00:15:29,279 --> 00:15:32,880
um all right

459
00:15:34,320 --> 00:15:37,040
let's go back

460
00:15:38,839 --> 00:15:41,839
here

461
00:15:42,079 --> 00:15:44,000
uh okay i think i'm running a little low

462
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:45,600
on time so i'm going to

463
00:15:45,600 --> 00:15:49,120
um sort of skip over the side

464
00:15:49,120 --> 00:15:51,360
slide again we can talk about it uh

465
00:15:51,360 --> 00:15:54,320
later as well

466
00:15:54,320 --> 00:15:56,560
so uh another thing i want to point out

467
00:15:56,560 --> 00:15:58,000
that i think is very important is that

468
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:00,160
comps also has other use cases right

469
00:16:00,160 --> 00:16:02,079
so we've been focusing primarily on the

470
00:16:02,079 --> 00:16:03,680
web fingerprinting threat model

471
00:16:03,680 --> 00:16:06,639
defeating the sort of biblical angel

472
00:16:06,639 --> 00:16:08,079
that is managing my router

473
00:16:08,079 --> 00:16:10,000
but let's consider a more common one sni

474
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:11,600
censorship you know is on the rise

475
00:16:11,600 --> 00:16:14,560
because https is on the rise and

476
00:16:14,560 --> 00:16:16,399
yeah i mentioned you know when you

477
00:16:16,399 --> 00:16:17,680
connect to

478
00:16:17,680 --> 00:16:20,079
an https website the server name is

479
00:16:20,079 --> 00:16:21,360
completely in the clear

480
00:16:21,360 --> 00:16:23,360
and this makes a really great target for

481
00:16:23,360 --> 00:16:24,959
sensors surveillers etc

482
00:16:24,959 --> 00:16:27,199
to use as a clear tech signal to either

483
00:16:27,199 --> 00:16:28,240
block the connection

484
00:16:28,240 --> 00:16:29,920
or throttle it or take some other action

485
00:16:29,920 --> 00:16:32,560
like throttling it and

486
00:16:32,560 --> 00:16:36,079
so you might ask

487
00:16:36,079 --> 00:16:38,720
uh why don't we do the thing that our

488
00:16:38,720 --> 00:16:40,800
good friend jeeves told us to do

489
00:16:40,800 --> 00:16:43,519
uh and just like use a vpn right that

490
00:16:43,519 --> 00:16:44,720
worked last time

491
00:16:44,720 --> 00:16:47,920
uh and so to that i would say you know

492
00:16:47,920 --> 00:16:50,720
vpns maybe are too slow i'm i'm gaming

493
00:16:50,720 --> 00:16:53,040
here so i clearly need that low ping

494
00:16:53,040 --> 00:16:56,079
to defeat my enemies and successfully um

495
00:16:56,079 --> 00:16:59,519
play neopets and so comps uh enables a

496
00:16:59,519 --> 00:17:01,040
sort of compromise right throw the

497
00:17:01,040 --> 00:17:03,120
handshake packet over the vpn path then

498
00:17:03,120 --> 00:17:04,079
migrate the

499
00:17:04,079 --> 00:17:05,839
enter of the connection back on to the

500
00:17:05,839 --> 00:17:07,919
sort of regular fast network path

501
00:17:07,919 --> 00:17:09,919
and so if you know your adversary isn't

502
00:17:09,919 --> 00:17:12,079
is just doing sort of keyword censorship

503
00:17:12,079 --> 00:17:13,919
uh nothing complicated then this would

504
00:17:13,919 --> 00:17:15,760
work and i can continue

505
00:17:15,760 --> 00:17:18,559
my gaming career on neopets there are

506
00:17:18,559 --> 00:17:20,079
also probably other reasons

507
00:17:20,079 --> 00:17:21,839
other than gaming to desire a faster

508
00:17:21,839 --> 00:17:23,359
internet connection but i'll leave that

509
00:17:23,359 --> 00:17:25,280
at your imagination

510
00:17:25,280 --> 00:17:28,319
so in conclusion some items oh yeah

511
00:17:28,319 --> 00:17:30,160
so yeah connections are less and less

512
00:17:30,160 --> 00:17:31,760
dependent on network addresses that's

513
00:17:31,760 --> 00:17:32,000
very

514
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:34,320
cool so we're proposing comps to perform

515
00:17:34,320 --> 00:17:35,919
this sort of mid-session splitting as a

516
00:17:35,919 --> 00:17:36,960
general defense

517
00:17:36,960 --> 00:17:40,000
against uh web network controls in

518
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:41,679
general

519
00:17:41,679 --> 00:17:43,520
some items you might find for discussion

520
00:17:43,520 --> 00:17:44,960
that could benefit from all of your

521
00:17:44,960 --> 00:17:46,240
expertise and your thoughts

522
00:17:46,240 --> 00:17:48,320
versus talking about systematic security

523
00:17:48,320 --> 00:17:49,919
evaluation there's a sort of

524
00:17:49,919 --> 00:17:51,679
explosion of hyper parameters for a very

525
00:17:51,679 --> 00:17:53,280
flexible system like this

526
00:17:53,280 --> 00:17:56,080
how do we design the best one best

527
00:17:56,080 --> 00:17:57,679
instantiation of pumps given certain

528
00:17:57,679 --> 00:17:58,799
resource constraints

529
00:17:58,799 --> 00:18:00,960
can we quantify the limits of what an

530
00:18:00,960 --> 00:18:02,720
adversary can learn from certain slices

531
00:18:02,720 --> 00:18:03,760
of the traffic

532
00:18:03,760 --> 00:18:05,440
we don't have a great answer for this

533
00:18:05,440 --> 00:18:07,120
other than sort of generating data sets

534
00:18:07,120 --> 00:18:07,760
with different

535
00:18:07,760 --> 00:18:10,000
cons instantiations and throwing dozens

536
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:11,600
of hours of ml at it and then

537
00:18:11,600 --> 00:18:13,600
you know if the cnn doesn't work then

538
00:18:13,600 --> 00:18:15,600
we're like yeah this is probably secure

539
00:18:15,600 --> 00:18:17,520
um but this doesn't seem very systematic

540
00:18:17,520 --> 00:18:19,360
to me and also i strongly dislike

541
00:18:19,360 --> 00:18:21,600
running ml evaluation so please help me

542
00:18:21,600 --> 00:18:24,400
um uh oh yeah and the second one is

543
00:18:24,400 --> 00:18:26,000
other use cases so we focused on

544
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:28,000
fingerprinting because there's this

545
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:29,919
established academic narrative

546
00:18:29,919 --> 00:18:31,840
you know and it's very interesting but

547
00:18:31,840 --> 00:18:33,520
i've seen you know tricks other than the

548
00:18:33,520 --> 00:18:35,039
one we talked about here that involve

549
00:18:35,039 --> 00:18:36,160
connection migration

550
00:18:36,160 --> 00:18:38,160
to do censorship circumvention so we

551
00:18:38,160 --> 00:18:39,600
invite the communication

552
00:18:39,600 --> 00:18:42,320
or the community to continue to think

553
00:18:42,320 --> 00:18:42,640
about

554
00:18:42,640 --> 00:18:44,559
other set models and how network

555
00:18:44,559 --> 00:18:45,919
agnostic protocols are

556
00:18:45,919 --> 00:18:47,360
sort of breaking the primitives that

557
00:18:47,360 --> 00:18:50,880
network control is reliant on

558
00:18:50,880 --> 00:18:57,120
that's all i got for today

559
00:18:57,120 --> 00:19:00,000
can i unsure

560
00:19:00,640 --> 00:19:04,480
yes so thank you very much mona

561
00:19:04,480 --> 00:19:06,000
interesting talk i'm sure that will

562
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:08,240
generate lots of discussion

563
00:19:08,240 --> 00:19:10,000
even if uh the discussion ends up

564
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:12,240
centering around fond memories of

565
00:19:12,240 --> 00:19:13,360
playing video games

566
00:19:13,360 --> 00:19:16,880
so our second speaker is muhammad

567
00:19:16,880 --> 00:19:20,000
uh take it away

568
00:19:20,320 --> 00:19:23,039
thank you very much i hope you see my

569
00:19:23,039 --> 00:19:25,200
screen

570
00:19:25,200 --> 00:19:27,520
hi everyone very happy to be here i'm

571
00:19:27,520 --> 00:19:29,440
presenting our recent work with

572
00:19:29,440 --> 00:19:31,360
anastasia and denny's

573
00:19:31,360 --> 00:19:34,799
on honest but curious nets basically

574
00:19:34,799 --> 00:19:37,679
we show that sensitive attributes of

575
00:19:37,679 --> 00:19:38,720
private data

576
00:19:38,720 --> 00:19:41,600
can be encoded into the classifier's

577
00:19:41,600 --> 00:19:44,080
output

578
00:19:44,240 --> 00:19:47,360
let's start with a motivational example

579
00:19:47,360 --> 00:19:51,679
we know that infinite information can be

580
00:19:51,679 --> 00:19:53,600
extracted from users

581
00:19:53,600 --> 00:19:57,039
faces like crazy attributes of

582
00:19:57,039 --> 00:20:00,320
emotion how attractive we are and

583
00:20:00,320 --> 00:20:03,120
even what else what is the body mass

584
00:20:03,120 --> 00:20:03,919
index

585
00:20:03,919 --> 00:20:07,280
just from face image these are all

586
00:20:07,280 --> 00:20:09,760
attributes that you can find public data

587
00:20:09,760 --> 00:20:10,640
sets for them

588
00:20:10,640 --> 00:20:13,840
out there and we know that

589
00:20:13,840 --> 00:20:17,120
every face has a face print all mobile

590
00:20:17,120 --> 00:20:18,799
devices are using to

591
00:20:18,799 --> 00:20:21,919
identify people but we are not

592
00:20:21,919 --> 00:20:25,120
always want to be identified everywhere

593
00:20:25,120 --> 00:20:28,000
so we care about the sensitive

594
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:29,039
attributes that

595
00:20:29,039 --> 00:20:32,640
about about our private data

596
00:20:32,640 --> 00:20:35,679
are collated

597
00:20:35,679 --> 00:20:38,880
as another motivational example just a

598
00:20:38,880 --> 00:20:39,840
few weeks ago

599
00:20:39,840 --> 00:20:43,120
an insurance company tweeted something

600
00:20:43,120 --> 00:20:46,159
which quickly went viral and

601
00:20:46,159 --> 00:20:49,360
lead to a blog post by that company

602
00:20:49,360 --> 00:20:53,440
apologizing that this is not what

603
00:20:53,440 --> 00:20:55,760
people are understanding about what we

604
00:20:55,760 --> 00:20:56,799
are doing

605
00:20:56,799 --> 00:20:59,039
but the point is that when an insurance

606
00:20:59,039 --> 00:21:00,799
company says that

607
00:21:00,799 --> 00:21:04,640
we can extract non-verbal cues

608
00:21:04,640 --> 00:21:07,520
from your face images to understand

609
00:21:07,520 --> 00:21:10,080
whether you are lying or not lying about

610
00:21:10,080 --> 00:21:11,440
a claim

611
00:21:11,440 --> 00:21:14,880
people are showing sensitivity

612
00:21:14,880 --> 00:21:18,640
and the point is that what are these

613
00:21:18,640 --> 00:21:20,240
non-verbal cues

614
00:21:20,240 --> 00:21:24,640
that you are extracting from my video to

615
00:21:24,640 --> 00:21:28,640
for example process my claim

616
00:21:28,640 --> 00:21:31,760
so this shows that

617
00:21:31,760 --> 00:21:35,280
when we processing people's private data

618
00:21:35,280 --> 00:21:38,320
we are not supposed to collect as

619
00:21:38,320 --> 00:21:41,039
much as i we can we sometimes just

620
00:21:41,039 --> 00:21:42,480
supposed to collect

621
00:21:42,480 --> 00:21:45,840
what we agreed already with the user

622
00:21:45,840 --> 00:21:49,760
to correlate from let's consider this

623
00:21:49,760 --> 00:21:50,640
scenario

624
00:21:50,640 --> 00:21:53,760
that i have a private data for example

625
00:21:53,760 --> 00:21:55,039
is my face image

626
00:21:55,039 --> 00:21:58,159
here is alan turing by the way and

627
00:21:58,159 --> 00:22:01,520
the task is to predict the age

628
00:22:01,520 --> 00:22:04,080
for example and there is a machine

629
00:22:04,080 --> 00:22:06,559
learning service providing a model which

630
00:22:06,559 --> 00:22:06,960
is an

631
00:22:06,960 --> 00:22:10,480
age classifier and it's supposed to

632
00:22:10,480 --> 00:22:11,679
classify

633
00:22:11,679 --> 00:22:14,799
the image and produce an output

634
00:22:14,799 --> 00:22:17,840
which estimates the probability

635
00:22:17,840 --> 00:22:20,400
let's consider binary classification

636
00:22:20,400 --> 00:22:22,960
whether it is more than 18 or

637
00:22:22,960 --> 00:22:26,720
less than 18. so

638
00:22:26,720 --> 00:22:28,480
we know that and in the literature you

639
00:22:28,480 --> 00:22:31,360
can find lots of uh

640
00:22:31,360 --> 00:22:34,799
prior words that show that if

641
00:22:34,799 --> 00:22:39,039
we let people to have access to this

642
00:22:39,039 --> 00:22:43,039
model f here and internal representation

643
00:22:43,039 --> 00:22:45,200
extracted by this model

644
00:22:45,200 --> 00:22:48,799
basically they can infer anything

645
00:22:48,799 --> 00:22:50,960
like for example if there is a sensitive

646
00:22:50,960 --> 00:22:52,880
attribute like gender

647
00:22:52,880 --> 00:22:56,000
that we don't want to be revealed and we

648
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:56,640
just want

649
00:22:56,640 --> 00:23:01,039
age to be classified here

650
00:23:01,039 --> 00:23:04,158
um so

651
00:23:04,320 --> 00:23:07,200
a machine learning service can extract

652
00:23:07,200 --> 00:23:09,280
this if we let them to process

653
00:23:09,280 --> 00:23:13,280
our data current state is that

654
00:23:13,280 --> 00:23:17,440
we can use h or encrypted computation

655
00:23:17,440 --> 00:23:22,240
to hide all the internal computation and

656
00:23:22,240 --> 00:23:24,480
just release the output so in this

657
00:23:24,480 --> 00:23:25,520
setting

658
00:23:25,520 --> 00:23:27,840
we can run for example the model on the

659
00:23:27,840 --> 00:23:29,760
browser or mobile or use

660
00:23:29,760 --> 00:23:33,360
encrypted computation and just

661
00:23:33,360 --> 00:23:36,559
reveal and just release with the machine

662
00:23:36,559 --> 00:23:38,320
learning service provider

663
00:23:38,320 --> 00:23:41,840
this single value 93 for example

664
00:23:41,840 --> 00:23:44,480
that is the probability of being more

665
00:23:44,480 --> 00:23:47,600
than 18 for example

666
00:23:47,600 --> 00:23:50,480
now the question is can a machine

667
00:23:50,480 --> 00:23:52,640
learning service

668
00:23:52,640 --> 00:23:56,320
just from this 93 0.93

669
00:23:56,320 --> 00:23:59,679
can they also infer the gender of the

670
00:23:59,679 --> 00:24:00,799
data owner

671
00:24:00,799 --> 00:24:03,760
or any other sensitive attribute that's

672
00:24:03,760 --> 00:24:04,000
the

673
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:06,080
question that we are answering in this

674
00:24:06,080 --> 00:24:07,039
word

675
00:24:07,039 --> 00:24:10,960
that even this single innocent looking

676
00:24:10,960 --> 00:24:14,720
number can be manipulated

677
00:24:14,720 --> 00:24:16,960
to reveal more than what is supposed to

678
00:24:16,960 --> 00:24:19,120
reveal

679
00:24:19,120 --> 00:24:22,720
so in a general setting we consider

680
00:24:22,720 --> 00:24:25,120
that there is a machine learning service

681
00:24:25,120 --> 00:24:26,080
providing

682
00:24:26,080 --> 00:24:29,279
a classifier f here

683
00:24:29,279 --> 00:24:32,400
and they process our data

684
00:24:32,400 --> 00:24:35,520
and we just let them observe the output

685
00:24:35,520 --> 00:24:36,640
of this model

686
00:24:36,640 --> 00:24:41,039
in two settings one where we just

687
00:24:41,039 --> 00:24:44,000
release the raw output of the model or

688
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:44,960
even

689
00:24:44,960 --> 00:24:48,400
we can do uh processing

690
00:24:48,400 --> 00:24:51,279
and for example by a soft mites option

691
00:24:51,279 --> 00:24:54,000
just reveal the probability like output

692
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:58,320
a soft score as we call it

693
00:24:58,320 --> 00:25:01,360
and so we have such a

694
00:25:01,360 --> 00:25:04,480
mark of chain that there is a data

695
00:25:04,480 --> 00:25:08,000
like face images and

696
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:10,720
the service is only supposed to infer y

697
00:25:10,720 --> 00:25:12,240
which is the target

698
00:25:12,240 --> 00:25:15,440
but from the output the y-hat that is

699
00:25:15,440 --> 00:25:18,559
the output of this model

700
00:25:18,559 --> 00:25:22,080
maybe they also trying to infer another

701
00:25:22,080 --> 00:25:23,679
sensitive attribute

702
00:25:23,679 --> 00:25:27,279
s-hat here so this is the general

703
00:25:27,279 --> 00:25:30,640
setting that we consider

704
00:25:30,640 --> 00:25:33,600
and we show that machine learning models

705
00:25:33,600 --> 00:25:34,960
can be trained to be

706
00:25:34,960 --> 00:25:38,480
honest but curious meaning that

707
00:25:38,480 --> 00:25:41,520
they can be honest in predicting

708
00:25:41,520 --> 00:25:44,960
the target attribute but at the same

709
00:25:44,960 --> 00:25:45,440
time

710
00:25:45,440 --> 00:25:48,960
they can also be curious in revealing

711
00:25:48,960 --> 00:25:51,279
a sensitive attribute through this

712
00:25:51,279 --> 00:25:54,000
single output

713
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:56,960
our main results which i will talk about

714
00:25:56,960 --> 00:25:58,159
them

715
00:25:58,159 --> 00:26:02,480
in a few minutes are that this is

716
00:26:02,480 --> 00:26:04,799
because of the over parameterized

717
00:26:04,799 --> 00:26:06,400
property of ml model

718
00:26:06,400 --> 00:26:09,840
basically high capacity of ml models

719
00:26:09,840 --> 00:26:13,120
allow us to have such an attack

720
00:26:13,120 --> 00:26:15,520
and we show that it is not easy to

721
00:26:15,520 --> 00:26:18,720
distinguish between a standard and hpc

722
00:26:18,720 --> 00:26:23,360
models and also we show that

723
00:26:23,360 --> 00:26:26,559
if these models are used in a teacher

724
00:26:26,559 --> 00:26:28,480
student or knowledge distillation

725
00:26:28,480 --> 00:26:29,600
setting

726
00:26:29,600 --> 00:26:33,360
then there is this risk that

727
00:26:33,360 --> 00:26:36,000
a honest but carious teacher can

728
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:40,159
transfer curiosity to students

729
00:26:40,159 --> 00:26:43,200
so to show some results let me just

730
00:26:43,200 --> 00:26:45,520
introduce a brief notation

731
00:26:45,520 --> 00:26:48,799
and when i show delta y i'm talking

732
00:26:48,799 --> 00:26:50,799
about the accuracy for the target

733
00:26:50,799 --> 00:26:51,600
attribute

734
00:26:51,600 --> 00:26:54,159
delta s is the accuracy for the

735
00:26:54,159 --> 00:26:55,919
sensitive attribute

736
00:26:55,919 --> 00:26:58,960
and a delta y delta shbc

737
00:26:58,960 --> 00:27:02,400
means that a model which is delta y

738
00:27:02,400 --> 00:27:05,679
accurate for the target and also delta s

739
00:27:05,679 --> 00:27:06,720
accurate

740
00:27:06,720 --> 00:27:10,640
for the sensitive attribute

741
00:27:11,279 --> 00:27:13,600
let's see this basic example consider

742
00:27:13,600 --> 00:27:15,520
this synthetic data set

743
00:27:15,520 --> 00:27:18,640
just a binary and two binary attributes

744
00:27:18,640 --> 00:27:20,880
and data is perfectly

745
00:27:20,880 --> 00:27:24,480
split into four regions and we know that

746
00:27:24,480 --> 00:27:26,559
for example for predicting y

747
00:27:26,559 --> 00:27:29,440
here we can perfectly use a logistic

748
00:27:29,440 --> 00:27:32,159
regression model

749
00:27:32,159 --> 00:27:35,279
but a logistic regression model does not

750
00:27:35,279 --> 00:27:36,799
have capacity to

751
00:27:36,799 --> 00:27:40,080
be also curious model this is the

752
00:27:40,080 --> 00:27:40,960
relation that

753
00:27:40,960 --> 00:27:42,880
we have for a logistic regression

754
00:27:42,880 --> 00:27:45,679
between honesty and curiosity

755
00:27:45,679 --> 00:27:49,120
for example if we use this line

756
00:27:49,120 --> 00:27:53,039
we can just be perfectly honest we can

757
00:27:53,039 --> 00:27:55,120
just predict perfectly

758
00:27:55,120 --> 00:27:58,240
y and we have random guess

759
00:27:58,240 --> 00:28:01,360
accuracy for attribute s

760
00:28:01,360 --> 00:28:04,240
but if we choose this decision boundary

761
00:28:04,240 --> 00:28:06,000
for logistic regression

762
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:08,159
then we can have moderate honesty and

763
00:28:08,159 --> 00:28:11,520
curiosity like 70 percent

764
00:28:11,520 --> 00:28:14,799
accuracy 75 percent and

765
00:28:14,799 --> 00:28:16,559
if we choose this one we will be

766
00:28:16,559 --> 00:28:18,240
perfectly curious but

767
00:28:18,240 --> 00:28:22,000
no honesty at all and

768
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:24,399
this shows that a simple logistic

769
00:28:24,399 --> 00:28:26,480
regression cannot be at the same time

770
00:28:26,480 --> 00:28:26,880
both

771
00:28:26,880 --> 00:28:30,080
honest and curious but

772
00:28:30,080 --> 00:28:33,360
if we just double the capacity

773
00:28:33,360 --> 00:28:36,640
like designing a models like this and we

774
00:28:36,640 --> 00:28:38,000
reveal the output

775
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:42,159
by this formula we can easily see that

776
00:28:42,159 --> 00:28:44,159
we can achieve perfect honesty and

777
00:28:44,159 --> 00:28:46,080
perfect curiosity

778
00:28:46,080 --> 00:28:49,120
i mean this model output has just

779
00:28:49,120 --> 00:28:52,799
four possible outputs which give us

780
00:28:52,799 --> 00:28:56,159
information about both attributes

781
00:28:56,159 --> 00:28:58,960
so the conclusion here is that just by

782
00:28:58,960 --> 00:29:00,799
doubling the capacity of

783
00:29:00,799 --> 00:29:03,360
a simple logistic regression model we

784
00:29:03,360 --> 00:29:05,760
can build another model

785
00:29:05,760 --> 00:29:09,039
that is both honest and both

786
00:29:09,039 --> 00:29:11,679
precarious in a perfect way for that

787
00:29:11,679 --> 00:29:13,600
synthetic data

788
00:29:13,600 --> 00:29:15,760
in the paper we have more theoretical

789
00:29:15,760 --> 00:29:16,799
results on

790
00:29:16,799 --> 00:29:19,919
convex optimization but i cannot explain

791
00:29:19,919 --> 00:29:22,320
it here

792
00:29:22,480 --> 00:29:26,000
but how about more complicated data list

793
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:29,520
both takes images we have experiment on

794
00:29:29,520 --> 00:29:34,000
two big data sets of face images

795
00:29:34,159 --> 00:29:37,840
for more complicated we showed that

796
00:29:37,840 --> 00:29:40,720
a regularized technique based on entropy

797
00:29:40,720 --> 00:29:42,240
can be used

798
00:29:42,240 --> 00:29:44,960
to train a model for being both honest

799
00:29:44,960 --> 00:29:46,559
and curious

800
00:29:46,559 --> 00:29:50,880
basically if you look at this formula

801
00:29:50,880 --> 00:29:52,840
the first one is the simple

802
00:29:52,840 --> 00:29:54,799
cross-entropy

803
00:29:54,799 --> 00:29:58,000
loss function for the target test but we

804
00:29:58,000 --> 00:29:58,960
can add

805
00:29:58,960 --> 00:30:02,000
another term to the typical binary cross

806
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:04,559
entropy loss function

807
00:30:04,559 --> 00:30:08,000
to put

808
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:11,200
the sensitive attribute into the output

809
00:30:11,200 --> 00:30:14,960
as we see for example when the sensitive

810
00:30:14,960 --> 00:30:17,600
attribute is zero

811
00:30:17,600 --> 00:30:20,880
so we can minimize the entropy and when

812
00:30:20,880 --> 00:30:22,240
the sensitive attribute

813
00:30:22,240 --> 00:30:24,880
is one we can maximize the entropy of

814
00:30:24,880 --> 00:30:25,520
output

815
00:30:25,520 --> 00:30:27,760
but this minimization and maximization

816
00:30:27,760 --> 00:30:30,080
of entropy can be done

817
00:30:30,080 --> 00:30:33,440
by some regularizer in a way that we

818
00:30:33,440 --> 00:30:37,440
can again be accurate for the add

819
00:30:37,440 --> 00:30:41,279
prediction of y and then by a threshold

820
00:30:41,279 --> 00:30:42,159
function

821
00:30:42,159 --> 00:30:45,200
we can easily

822
00:30:46,480 --> 00:30:49,679
infer the attribute is

823
00:30:49,679 --> 00:30:52,080
the sensitive attribute but just by

824
00:30:52,080 --> 00:30:54,399
looking at the y hat which is the

825
00:30:54,399 --> 00:30:58,080
output for the target attribute

826
00:30:58,080 --> 00:31:01,760
a result on a utk

827
00:31:01,760 --> 00:31:04,559
data set for example for two attribute

828
00:31:04,559 --> 00:31:05,200
gender

829
00:31:05,200 --> 00:31:09,360
and race we see that for gender

830
00:31:09,360 --> 00:31:12,880
the standard model can get a very good

831
00:31:12,880 --> 00:31:14,000
accuracy

832
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:17,200
it's the target test but a standard

833
00:31:17,200 --> 00:31:20,880
model cannot be accurate for the race

834
00:31:20,880 --> 00:31:24,159
the top plots but in the bottom plots

835
00:31:24,159 --> 00:31:27,919
we see that hpc model just by trading

836
00:31:27,919 --> 00:31:30,960
a bit accuracy for the public target

837
00:31:30,960 --> 00:31:32,320
task

838
00:31:32,320 --> 00:31:35,360
can achieve a very high accuracy

839
00:31:35,360 --> 00:31:38,320
also for the race which is the sensitive

840
00:31:38,320 --> 00:31:40,000
test

841
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:42,880
we also in the paper show a more

842
00:31:42,880 --> 00:31:45,120
generalized attack for

843
00:31:45,120 --> 00:31:48,320
attributes beyond binary attributes i

844
00:31:48,320 --> 00:31:53,519
can talk about this in discussion part

845
00:31:53,519 --> 00:31:56,320
for example if we consider agent rays

846
00:31:56,320 --> 00:31:59,600
three classes each of them

847
00:31:59,600 --> 00:32:03,440
we see that we can train a model

848
00:32:03,440 --> 00:32:06,640
that achieve the same honesty or

849
00:32:06,640 --> 00:32:10,000
accuracy for the target task similar to

850
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:11,039
the

851
00:32:11,039 --> 00:32:14,480
standard model but can achieve

852
00:32:14,480 --> 00:32:17,360
a much higher accuracy in predicting the

853
00:32:17,360 --> 00:32:19,679
sensitive attributes

854
00:32:19,679 --> 00:32:24,000
we also considered a compression

855
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:27,640
operation to hide this kind of

856
00:32:27,640 --> 00:32:30,159
suspiciousness in this model because

857
00:32:30,159 --> 00:32:33,519
if you look at the average entropy

858
00:32:33,519 --> 00:32:36,720
of um honest but curious model you see

859
00:32:36,720 --> 00:32:37,360
that they

860
00:32:37,360 --> 00:32:41,120
tend to have higher entropy outputs

861
00:32:41,120 --> 00:32:44,480
so this may make them

862
00:32:44,480 --> 00:32:48,000
to be revealed by the users

863
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:51,039
but a compression technique can help

864
00:32:51,039 --> 00:32:54,240
to also keep the output entropy of these

865
00:32:54,240 --> 00:32:55,279
models

866
00:32:55,279 --> 00:33:00,480
as similar as a standard model

867
00:33:01,360 --> 00:33:03,440
and the final result that i'm showing

868
00:33:03,440 --> 00:33:05,120
now is a result on

869
00:33:05,120 --> 00:33:09,519
a violin vulnerability vulnerability to

870
00:33:09,519 --> 00:33:12,640
knowledge distillation and we showed

871
00:33:12,640 --> 00:33:13,919
that

872
00:33:13,919 --> 00:33:16,799
if a teacher for example if this is a

873
00:33:16,799 --> 00:33:19,840
typical setting these days that

874
00:33:19,840 --> 00:33:22,320
people who have access to large data

875
00:33:22,320 --> 00:33:24,000
sets train a model as

876
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:27,279
teacher and then make them public and

877
00:33:27,279 --> 00:33:29,039
people that have data

878
00:33:29,039 --> 00:33:32,320
but don't have label for them use this

879
00:33:32,320 --> 00:33:36,000
to do knowledge distillation and we have

880
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:39,120
shown that this knowledge distillation

881
00:33:39,120 --> 00:33:43,519
is susceptible to this kind of

882
00:33:43,519 --> 00:33:46,320
attack by teach the provider of the

883
00:33:46,320 --> 00:33:47,120
teacher

884
00:33:47,120 --> 00:33:50,399
model and

885
00:33:50,399 --> 00:33:54,320
i think yeah that's the

886
00:33:55,440 --> 00:33:58,240
basically take away of this talk that

887
00:33:58,240 --> 00:34:00,880
machine learning service providers can

888
00:34:00,880 --> 00:34:02,799
train their model

889
00:34:02,799 --> 00:34:05,039
to encode a sensitive entry to be

890
00:34:05,039 --> 00:34:06,000
attribute

891
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:09,839
into the innocent looking output

892
00:34:09,839 --> 00:34:12,320
for a target attribute there are some

893
00:34:12,320 --> 00:34:12,879
open

894
00:34:12,879 --> 00:34:16,159
questions that we can discuss later

895
00:34:16,159 --> 00:34:18,399
about how to distinguish between these

896
00:34:18,399 --> 00:34:20,239
two or how to encode

897
00:34:20,239 --> 00:34:23,280
more than one attribute and also the

898
00:34:23,280 --> 00:34:24,719
implication of these

899
00:34:24,719 --> 00:34:28,000
on other area of machine learning such

900
00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:29,199
as federated

901
00:34:29,199 --> 00:34:34,230
learning thank you very much

902
00:34:34,230 --> 00:34:36,480
[Music]

903
00:34:36,480 --> 00:34:38,159
okay thank you very much muhammad

904
00:34:38,159 --> 00:34:39,918
another interesting talk

905
00:34:39,918 --> 00:34:43,679
so we have one more speaker who's

906
00:34:43,679 --> 00:34:46,719
escaping me for some reason um which one

907
00:34:46,719 --> 00:34:48,159
was next

908
00:34:48,159 --> 00:34:51,199
sorry i should have killed him as next

909
00:34:51,199 --> 00:34:53,599
um so we have one more speaker in this

910
00:34:53,599 --> 00:34:54,320
section

911
00:34:54,320 --> 00:34:57,760
subham and then we'll jump into the um

912
00:34:57,760 --> 00:35:00,079
30-ish minutes for q a looks like we'll

913
00:35:00,079 --> 00:35:02,000
be slightly less than 30 minutes but

914
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:05,839
uh yes take it away so

915
00:35:05,839 --> 00:35:11,119
yeah okay let's see

916
00:35:14,839 --> 00:35:17,200
okay so can i even see the screen i

917
00:35:17,200 --> 00:35:18,400
think they can

918
00:35:18,400 --> 00:35:21,359
go to thank hello everyone i am shivam

919
00:35:21,359 --> 00:35:22,400
jain

920
00:35:22,400 --> 00:35:24,800
and i am a graduate student at imperial

921
00:35:24,800 --> 00:35:26,400
college london

922
00:35:26,400 --> 00:35:28,560
and today we will be talking about the

923
00:35:28,560 --> 00:35:30,400
ongoing crypto wars

924
00:35:30,400 --> 00:35:33,119
which are based around the messaging

925
00:35:33,119 --> 00:35:34,240
platforms

926
00:35:34,240 --> 00:35:36,400
that we use at least i use on day-to-day

927
00:35:36,400 --> 00:35:38,720
basis like whatsapp signal

928
00:35:38,720 --> 00:35:42,000
and so on so let's start with the

929
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:44,560
story of when it began so this started

930
00:35:44,560 --> 00:35:46,079
in 2013

931
00:35:46,079 --> 00:35:49,440
when signal or then of messaging

932
00:35:49,440 --> 00:35:52,160
supported service tech secure released

933
00:35:52,160 --> 00:35:54,880
an app along with their protocol which

934
00:35:54,880 --> 00:35:55,839
provided

935
00:35:55,839 --> 00:35:59,440
two people to chat with each other

936
00:35:59,440 --> 00:36:02,000
in a encrypted end to an encrypted

937
00:36:02,000 --> 00:36:03,119
fashion such that

938
00:36:03,119 --> 00:36:04,960
the intermediary servers cannot know

939
00:36:04,960 --> 00:36:06,640
anything about what they are doing

940
00:36:06,640 --> 00:36:10,079
or what they are talking about in 2014

941
00:36:10,079 --> 00:36:12,640
this protocol was adopted by whatsapp

942
00:36:12,640 --> 00:36:15,119
then came secret chats and telegram

943
00:36:15,119 --> 00:36:18,079
in 2016 messenger by facebook released

944
00:36:18,079 --> 00:36:20,240
secret conversations based on this

945
00:36:20,240 --> 00:36:23,119
protocol and today we have more than 2

946
00:36:23,119 --> 00:36:24,800
billion users who use this

947
00:36:24,800 --> 00:36:26,640
end-to-end encrypted services on a

948
00:36:26,640 --> 00:36:28,720
day-to-day basis

949
00:36:28,720 --> 00:36:32,079
and instagram and messenger might

950
00:36:32,079 --> 00:36:34,560
use and adopt end-to-end encryption all

951
00:36:34,560 --> 00:36:35,599
over their

952
00:36:35,599 --> 00:36:38,960
messaging platforms by 2022

953
00:36:38,960 --> 00:36:40,560
so what how does the end-to-end

954
00:36:40,560 --> 00:36:42,079
encryption works

955
00:36:42,079 --> 00:36:44,720
and the promise of end-to-end encryption

956
00:36:44,720 --> 00:36:46,720
is that when i'm talking to someone when

957
00:36:46,720 --> 00:36:48,160
i'm chatting with someone

958
00:36:48,160 --> 00:36:50,000
it's only me and the other person or the

959
00:36:50,000 --> 00:36:51,760
group of people should know

960
00:36:51,760 --> 00:36:54,720
what i am talking about and not the

961
00:36:54,720 --> 00:36:56,320
intermediate servers

962
00:36:56,320 --> 00:36:57,920
so how it works is basically let's say

963
00:36:57,920 --> 00:36:59,520
i'm sending a message there's a

964
00:36:59,520 --> 00:37:02,560
shared secret key on my device

965
00:37:02,560 --> 00:37:04,320
which encrypts a message an encrypted

966
00:37:04,320 --> 00:37:06,560
message is then sent to a server

967
00:37:06,560 --> 00:37:08,720
server then sends this message to the

968
00:37:08,720 --> 00:37:10,320
recipient which then decrypted

969
00:37:10,320 --> 00:37:12,720
the shared key and then we both can

970
00:37:12,720 --> 00:37:14,640
share the messages

971
00:37:14,640 --> 00:37:17,760
now not just text we can also send

972
00:37:17,760 --> 00:37:21,040
images with this or any other media

973
00:37:21,040 --> 00:37:23,599
and the question comes then this can

974
00:37:23,599 --> 00:37:24,960
also be used

975
00:37:24,960 --> 00:37:28,240
to share possibly illegal content

976
00:37:28,240 --> 00:37:31,440
and several organizations and

977
00:37:31,440 --> 00:37:35,200
researchers have raised the concern that

978
00:37:35,200 --> 00:37:36,960
encrypted messaging platforms can be

979
00:37:36,960 --> 00:37:38,640
used to share

980
00:37:38,640 --> 00:37:41,440
any illegal content such as child porn

981
00:37:41,440 --> 00:37:42,480
or

982
00:37:42,480 --> 00:37:45,680
ex terrorist content or something else

983
00:37:45,680 --> 00:37:48,480
and illegal as defined by the

984
00:37:48,480 --> 00:37:50,640
enforcement authorities

985
00:37:50,640 --> 00:37:52,800
but the server won't know what is going

986
00:37:52,800 --> 00:37:55,040
by

987
00:37:55,119 --> 00:37:58,160
and now people came together again to

988
00:37:58,160 --> 00:37:59,440
find a solution

989
00:37:59,440 --> 00:38:01,680
that okay how do we stop this what do we

990
00:38:01,680 --> 00:38:04,320
do and like in 90s the first solution

991
00:38:04,320 --> 00:38:05,599
that they came up with

992
00:38:05,599 --> 00:38:08,400
is key escrow systems or one of the

993
00:38:08,400 --> 00:38:09,599
first

994
00:38:09,599 --> 00:38:12,560
and what it is is basically you have a

995
00:38:12,560 --> 00:38:13,440
set of

996
00:38:13,440 --> 00:38:16,800
devices and the keys are stored on a

997
00:38:16,800 --> 00:38:19,040
cloud or in a database

998
00:38:19,040 --> 00:38:22,160
in some secured way

999
00:38:22,240 --> 00:38:25,839
and third parties or law enforcement for

1000
00:38:25,839 --> 00:38:27,839
example law enforcement agencies

1001
00:38:27,839 --> 00:38:30,640
can ask for these keys under exceptional

1002
00:38:30,640 --> 00:38:31,200
access

1003
00:38:31,200 --> 00:38:33,280
or under certain circumstances which are

1004
00:38:33,280 --> 00:38:35,839
predefined

1005
00:38:36,400 --> 00:38:40,480
and so these key escrow systems

1006
00:38:40,480 --> 00:38:43,680
are raises significant privacy concerns

1007
00:38:43,680 --> 00:38:44,800
within the privacy

1008
00:38:44,800 --> 00:38:48,000
pets community including by researchers

1009
00:38:48,000 --> 00:38:49,200
that were there i think

1010
00:38:49,200 --> 00:38:51,119
yesterday and maybe now in the session

1011
00:38:51,119 --> 00:38:52,560
as well

1012
00:38:52,560 --> 00:38:55,040
and the main concern that is being

1013
00:38:55,040 --> 00:38:56,720
raised against this

1014
00:38:56,720 --> 00:38:59,119
systems is that firstly it is

1015
00:38:59,119 --> 00:39:00,560
impractical to build

1016
00:39:00,560 --> 00:39:03,839
such a key escrow system for

1017
00:39:03,839 --> 00:39:05,520
large scale data like you're handling

1018
00:39:05,520 --> 00:39:07,760
keys for 2 billion users

1019
00:39:07,760 --> 00:39:09,440
but at the same time you need this to be

1020
00:39:09,440 --> 00:39:11,839
secure and you need this to be abuse

1021
00:39:11,839 --> 00:39:13,680
resistant

1022
00:39:13,680 --> 00:39:16,000
and this concern comes from is grounded

1023
00:39:16,000 --> 00:39:17,200
in the

1024
00:39:17,200 --> 00:39:18,960
examples that we have seen over the

1025
00:39:18,960 --> 00:39:21,119
years for example companies like apple

1026
00:39:21,119 --> 00:39:22,800
have tried building such as

1027
00:39:22,800 --> 00:39:26,480
such a escrow system but even those have

1028
00:39:26,480 --> 00:39:28,800
been found to be vulnerable

1029
00:39:28,800 --> 00:39:31,119
and the community doesn't have enough

1030
00:39:31,119 --> 00:39:34,560
confidence that this is possible

1031
00:39:34,640 --> 00:39:36,320
so since last few years people have been

1032
00:39:36,320 --> 00:39:38,480
wondering that okay what are the other

1033
00:39:38,480 --> 00:39:40,160
possible solutions

1034
00:39:40,160 --> 00:39:41,760
and they come up with an alternative

1035
00:39:41,760 --> 00:39:45,200
which is client-side scanning

1036
00:39:45,200 --> 00:39:48,240
and the way this works is you have now i

1037
00:39:48,240 --> 00:39:49,200
i want to send a

1038
00:39:49,200 --> 00:39:52,640
miss image to someone i

1039
00:39:52,640 --> 00:39:56,000
upload it on my app for example whatsapp

1040
00:39:56,000 --> 00:39:57,680
now the whatsapp will create a digital

1041
00:39:57,680 --> 00:39:59,599
fingerprint which is

1042
00:39:59,599 --> 00:40:01,760
in this fingerprinting algorithm will be

1043
00:40:01,760 --> 00:40:04,480
part of the app itself

1044
00:40:04,480 --> 00:40:06,400
and this fingerprint will then be sent

1045
00:40:06,400 --> 00:40:07,599
to check for a match

1046
00:40:07,599 --> 00:40:09,839
against a database of fingerprints of

1047
00:40:09,839 --> 00:40:13,119
known illegal images

1048
00:40:13,760 --> 00:40:16,880
and if a match is found i wouldn't be

1049
00:40:16,880 --> 00:40:18,000
allowed to send a

1050
00:40:18,000 --> 00:40:19,680
send this message and some further

1051
00:40:19,680 --> 00:40:21,440
action will be taken depending on the

1052
00:40:21,440 --> 00:40:22,960
implementation

1053
00:40:22,960 --> 00:40:26,640
and if the no match is found then i can

1054
00:40:26,640 --> 00:40:28,720
encrypt the data and the message is sent

1055
00:40:28,720 --> 00:40:31,279
as routine

1056
00:40:32,640 --> 00:40:35,760
so again like when this came out about

1057
00:40:35,760 --> 00:40:37,599
in last couple of years

1058
00:40:37,599 --> 00:40:39,280
and several privacy concerns have been

1059
00:40:39,280 --> 00:40:41,280
raised against this as well

1060
00:40:41,280 --> 00:40:44,960
and firstly the biggest concern is that

1061
00:40:44,960 --> 00:40:45,280
this

1062
00:40:45,280 --> 00:40:47,680
increases attack surfaces what does it

1063
00:40:47,680 --> 00:40:50,960
mean is that now you have

1064
00:40:50,960 --> 00:40:54,079
uh digital fingerprinting algorithm and

1065
00:40:54,079 --> 00:40:55,839
match that is happening which can

1066
00:40:55,839 --> 00:40:58,560
possibly be exploited by

1067
00:40:58,560 --> 00:41:00,720
hackers or attackers or other

1068
00:41:00,720 --> 00:41:02,319
adversaries

1069
00:41:02,319 --> 00:41:04,079
then the second most important question

1070
00:41:04,079 --> 00:41:06,319
here is who controls the database what

1071
00:41:06,319 --> 00:41:07,440
is the process

1072
00:41:07,440 --> 00:41:09,359
what is there in the database how do you

1073
00:41:09,359 --> 00:41:11,839
avoid this being

1074
00:41:11,839 --> 00:41:15,200
abused further you start with illegal

1075
00:41:15,200 --> 00:41:15,839
content

1076
00:41:15,839 --> 00:41:18,880
such as csam or child porn

1077
00:41:18,880 --> 00:41:21,680
you go with terrorism what stops them

1078
00:41:21,680 --> 00:41:22,480
from

1079
00:41:22,480 --> 00:41:27,200
using it for other purposes

1080
00:41:27,200 --> 00:41:28,720
so there is a possibility of mission

1081
00:41:28,720 --> 00:41:31,040
creep

1082
00:41:32,640 --> 00:41:35,920
so based on this the other concern that

1083
00:41:35,920 --> 00:41:36,640
has come up

1084
00:41:36,640 --> 00:41:40,319
is basically can an adversary evade

1085
00:41:40,319 --> 00:41:42,560
detection for example if i were to send

1086
00:41:42,560 --> 00:41:43,680
this dog message

1087
00:41:43,680 --> 00:41:47,280
dog photo and if a match was found

1088
00:41:47,280 --> 00:41:49,599
can an adversary who just has access to

1089
00:41:49,599 --> 00:41:50,720
this app

1090
00:41:50,720 --> 00:41:53,839
in a black box setup try to change this

1091
00:41:53,839 --> 00:41:56,960
image by a little bit and

1092
00:41:56,960 --> 00:41:59,359
create a new hash such that it will

1093
00:41:59,359 --> 00:42:02,000
evade detection

1094
00:42:02,000 --> 00:42:04,160
this is the question we ask in our

1095
00:42:04,160 --> 00:42:05,040
research is that

1096
00:42:05,040 --> 00:42:06,720
is client-side scanning is a robust

1097
00:42:06,720 --> 00:42:08,240
solution

1098
00:42:08,240 --> 00:42:11,040
is it possible to evade detection easily

1099
00:42:11,040 --> 00:42:13,520
or not

1100
00:42:13,520 --> 00:42:15,760
and to do this we first understand how

1101
00:42:15,760 --> 00:42:17,119
exactly the

1102
00:42:17,119 --> 00:42:21,040
proposed client-side scanning will work

1103
00:42:21,040 --> 00:42:22,720
and the current proposals rely on

1104
00:42:22,720 --> 00:42:24,960
perceptual hashing algorithms

1105
00:42:24,960 --> 00:42:27,440
so these are the standard algorithms

1106
00:42:27,440 --> 00:42:28,160
that have been

1107
00:42:28,160 --> 00:42:30,800
there in the usage since couple of

1108
00:42:30,800 --> 00:42:32,800
decades where they are mainly used for

1109
00:42:32,800 --> 00:42:35,680
efficient image retrieval the way it

1110
00:42:35,680 --> 00:42:37,440
works is basically you say

1111
00:42:37,440 --> 00:42:40,160
give an image it creates an index or a

1112
00:42:40,160 --> 00:42:41,599
fingerprint which is much smaller in

1113
00:42:41,599 --> 00:42:42,400
size

1114
00:42:42,400 --> 00:42:45,280
and so it protects privacy in some way

1115
00:42:45,280 --> 00:42:47,040
and that's why the claim is

1116
00:42:47,040 --> 00:42:49,440
that the client side scanning does not

1117
00:42:49,440 --> 00:42:51,040
just solve this problem but

1118
00:42:51,040 --> 00:42:55,279
it does it in a privacy preserving way

1119
00:42:55,680 --> 00:42:57,920
and the perceptual hashing algorithms

1120
00:42:57,920 --> 00:42:59,760
are designed such a way that similar

1121
00:42:59,760 --> 00:43:00,480
images

1122
00:43:00,480 --> 00:43:04,319
would have similar fingerprints so that

1123
00:43:04,319 --> 00:43:06,960
it is harder to modify an image and

1124
00:43:06,960 --> 00:43:09,359
e-way detection

1125
00:43:09,359 --> 00:43:11,040
while the different images would have

1126
00:43:11,040 --> 00:43:14,079
completely different fingerprints

1127
00:43:14,079 --> 00:43:16,880
facebook's pdq is one of the commonly

1128
00:43:16,880 --> 00:43:17,599
used

1129
00:43:17,599 --> 00:43:20,000
open and also open sourced perceptual

1130
00:43:20,000 --> 00:43:21,680
hashing algorithm

1131
00:43:21,680 --> 00:43:25,119
and it is important to note this because

1132
00:43:25,119 --> 00:43:26,560
purchase flashing algorithms which are

1133
00:43:26,560 --> 00:43:28,640
used in practice lot of them

1134
00:43:28,640 --> 00:43:30,800
are closed source and no details are

1135
00:43:30,800 --> 00:43:34,240
available to the public

1136
00:43:34,960 --> 00:43:36,720
so and the next part is now you have the

1137
00:43:36,720 --> 00:43:38,079
fingerprint that you created using

1138
00:43:38,079 --> 00:43:39,280
perceptual hashing

1139
00:43:39,280 --> 00:43:42,400
how do you match the fingerprints so for

1140
00:43:42,400 --> 00:43:42,960
each

1141
00:43:42,960 --> 00:43:46,240
fingerprint we in the database we match

1142
00:43:46,240 --> 00:43:46,880
the

1143
00:43:46,880 --> 00:43:48,960
send fingerprint with it and we measure

1144
00:43:48,960 --> 00:43:50,720
a distance between the two

1145
00:43:50,720 --> 00:43:52,560
and this distance is measured using

1146
00:43:52,560 --> 00:43:54,000
something like a hamming distance which

1147
00:43:54,000 --> 00:43:55,680
is basically you take the two

1148
00:43:55,680 --> 00:43:58,240
fingerprints and you see how many pixels

1149
00:43:58,240 --> 00:44:01,200
are different if number of different

1150
00:44:01,200 --> 00:44:03,280
pixels is less than a sum predefined

1151
00:44:03,280 --> 00:44:04,560
threshold

1152
00:44:04,560 --> 00:44:07,280
then you say yes it's a match if there

1153
00:44:07,280 --> 00:44:08,480
is no such

1154
00:44:08,480 --> 00:44:10,640
match possible or in the database you

1155
00:44:10,640 --> 00:44:13,520
say there is no match form

1156
00:44:13,520 --> 00:44:16,000
now if it was a safe image or a non

1157
00:44:16,000 --> 00:44:17,839
illegal image

1158
00:44:17,839 --> 00:44:20,000
and a match was found that is false

1159
00:44:20,000 --> 00:44:21,599
positive it shouldn't be there

1160
00:44:21,599 --> 00:44:24,960
it shouldn't be flagged and ideally it

1161
00:44:24,960 --> 00:44:25,839
should be

1162
00:44:25,839 --> 00:44:27,359
saved as no match found which is a true

1163
00:44:27,359 --> 00:44:29,520
negative and similarly we have an

1164
00:44:29,520 --> 00:44:31,760
if an illegal image was found a match

1165
00:44:31,760 --> 00:44:33,520
that is true positive

1166
00:44:33,520 --> 00:44:36,800
and if a legal image was could evade

1167
00:44:36,800 --> 00:44:38,240
the match then it would be a false

1168
00:44:38,240 --> 00:44:40,720
negative

1169
00:44:40,880 --> 00:44:43,839
the threshold is basically chosen such

1170
00:44:43,839 --> 00:44:45,200
that it balances

1171
00:44:45,200 --> 00:44:46,720
the trade-off between the false

1172
00:44:46,720 --> 00:44:50,319
positives and false negatives

1173
00:44:50,319 --> 00:44:52,000
it is chosen in such a way that both of

1174
00:44:52,000 --> 00:44:54,560
them are within a certain limit

1175
00:44:54,560 --> 00:44:57,760
and what we know is obvious like

1176
00:44:57,760 --> 00:45:00,079
as threshold will increase more images

1177
00:45:00,079 --> 00:45:01,119
would be flagged

1178
00:45:01,119 --> 00:45:02,960
the false positives would increase true

1179
00:45:02,960 --> 00:45:04,160
positives will also increase

1180
00:45:04,160 --> 00:45:07,680
and the false negatives would decrease

1181
00:45:07,680 --> 00:45:09,760
and again going back to facebook's pdq

1182
00:45:09,760 --> 00:45:11,599
it recommends a threshold of somewhere

1183
00:45:11,599 --> 00:45:13,119
from 20 to 90

1184
00:45:13,119 --> 00:45:14,560
why we are mentioning this because we'll

1185
00:45:14,560 --> 00:45:17,119
come back to this later

1186
00:45:17,119 --> 00:45:20,720
so what we show is basically now

1187
00:45:20,720 --> 00:45:23,760
can adversary bypass the detection by

1188
00:45:23,760 --> 00:45:26,240
css and now what we know from

1189
00:45:26,240 --> 00:45:28,880
the our knowledge of the proposed client

1190
00:45:28,880 --> 00:45:30,480
side scanning

1191
00:45:30,480 --> 00:45:34,079
is that our adversary has

1192
00:45:34,079 --> 00:45:36,160
access to black box and now it wants to

1193
00:45:36,160 --> 00:45:37,920
change the

1194
00:45:37,920 --> 00:45:39,920
image in such a way that the resulting

1195
00:45:39,920 --> 00:45:41,920
hash is away

1196
00:45:41,920 --> 00:45:45,440
at a distance of at least t or from the

1197
00:45:45,440 --> 00:45:49,119
original hash the adversary will choose

1198
00:45:49,119 --> 00:45:50,160
the threshold

1199
00:45:50,160 --> 00:45:51,680
will choose the image that it wants to

1200
00:45:51,680 --> 00:45:53,839
perturb and

1201
00:45:53,839 --> 00:45:56,319
run the black box attack or if it and

1202
00:45:56,319 --> 00:45:58,720
see if it is possible

1203
00:45:58,720 --> 00:46:01,040
and what we show is basically that more

1204
00:46:01,040 --> 00:46:02,560
than 99.9

1205
00:46:02,560 --> 00:46:05,280
of images can be modified successfully

1206
00:46:05,280 --> 00:46:08,160
using standard blackbox adversarial

1207
00:46:08,160 --> 00:46:10,960
ml techniques for five popular hashing

1208
00:46:10,960 --> 00:46:12,839
algorithms and a wide range of detection

1209
00:46:12,839 --> 00:46:14,079
thresholds

1210
00:46:14,079 --> 00:46:16,800
for this we used image in a dataset and

1211
00:46:16,800 --> 00:46:18,800
we adopted a standard

1212
00:46:18,800 --> 00:46:21,119
approach for the adversary attack based

1213
00:46:21,119 --> 00:46:24,480
on evolutionary strategies

1214
00:46:24,720 --> 00:46:26,480
so the images look like something like

1215
00:46:26,480 --> 00:46:28,000
this so here on the left

1216
00:46:28,000 --> 00:46:29,599
you can see the top examples you have

1217
00:46:29,599 --> 00:46:31,200
the original image

1218
00:46:31,200 --> 00:46:32,800
on the right you have the modified image

1219
00:46:32,800 --> 00:46:36,640
for pdq algorithm when threshold was 30.

1220
00:46:36,640 --> 00:46:39,040
at the bottom you can see for four

1221
00:46:39,040 --> 00:46:40,800
different thresholds for the pdq that we

1222
00:46:40,800 --> 00:46:42,000
tried 30 70

1223
00:46:42,000 --> 00:46:45,440
85 and 90 and

1224
00:46:45,440 --> 00:46:48,800
almost all the images seem really

1225
00:46:48,800 --> 00:46:52,560
very similar but at the same time now

1226
00:46:52,560 --> 00:46:54,880
we know that we can successfully perturb

1227
00:46:54,880 --> 00:46:56,720
the images images look similar

1228
00:46:56,720 --> 00:46:58,400
but does it really evade detection

1229
00:46:58,400 --> 00:47:00,400
because now it's not about one image

1230
00:47:00,400 --> 00:47:03,440
it's about the whole database so the

1231
00:47:03,440 --> 00:47:04,800
question we asked next is

1232
00:47:04,800 --> 00:47:06,960
is pushing hash beyond the threshold t

1233
00:47:06,960 --> 00:47:09,680
enough to evade detection

1234
00:47:09,680 --> 00:47:11,440
and to answer this we calculate the

1235
00:47:11,440 --> 00:47:12,800
false negative rate

1236
00:47:12,800 --> 00:47:14,960
which is probability that a modified

1237
00:47:14,960 --> 00:47:18,800
illegal image would evade detection

1238
00:47:18,800 --> 00:47:20,720
and we create a data for this we use

1239
00:47:20,720 --> 00:47:22,480
image the data set again and a database

1240
00:47:22,480 --> 00:47:22,960
size

1241
00:47:22,960 --> 00:47:26,640
of 100 000 and we find that for

1242
00:47:26,640 --> 00:47:28,960
threshold of 30

1243
00:47:28,960 --> 00:47:32,880
97 of the modified illegal images evaded

1244
00:47:32,880 --> 00:47:34,240
detection

1245
00:47:34,240 --> 00:47:37,440
and this number goes down to 67 as we

1246
00:47:37,440 --> 00:47:39,440
increase the threshold

1247
00:47:39,440 --> 00:47:42,240
so yes if we increase the threshold the

1248
00:47:42,240 --> 00:47:45,119
attack becomes a bit harder to carry out

1249
00:47:45,119 --> 00:47:46,960
but is increasing threshold and

1250
00:47:46,960 --> 00:47:49,599
effective defense

1251
00:47:49,599 --> 00:47:53,119
and to measure this we use false

1252
00:47:53,119 --> 00:47:54,720
positive rate which is probability that

1253
00:47:54,720 --> 00:47:57,440
a safe image is detected falsely

1254
00:47:57,440 --> 00:48:00,960
or detected wrongly and

1255
00:48:00,960 --> 00:48:02,960
what we see is that when we use a

1256
00:48:02,960 --> 00:48:04,720
smaller threshold

1257
00:48:04,720 --> 00:48:07,920
about one out of thousand images

1258
00:48:07,920 --> 00:48:11,359
are or safe images are false rejected

1259
00:48:11,359 --> 00:48:14,319
but as soon as we go to like threshold

1260
00:48:14,319 --> 00:48:15,839
of 90 which is where we

1261
00:48:15,839 --> 00:48:18,000
saw earlier our attack might become a

1262
00:48:18,000 --> 00:48:20,240
bit a bit difficult

1263
00:48:20,240 --> 00:48:23,520
here every third image is being flagged

1264
00:48:23,520 --> 00:48:27,119
wrongly what does it mean in practice

1265
00:48:27,119 --> 00:48:30,240
is that if there were 4.5

1266
00:48:30,240 --> 00:48:33,760
safe images that were shared daily

1267
00:48:33,760 --> 00:48:37,599
4.5 billion then almost 1.6 or 1.5

1268
00:48:37,599 --> 00:48:39,280
billion images would be flagged

1269
00:48:39,280 --> 00:48:41,599
daily

1270
00:48:42,720 --> 00:48:45,040
so to conclude this i think there are

1271
00:48:45,040 --> 00:48:46,240
three main points that we discussed

1272
00:48:46,240 --> 00:48:47,680
today firstly

1273
00:48:47,680 --> 00:48:49,280
we talked about client side scanning

1274
00:48:49,280 --> 00:48:50,880
which is proposed as a privacy

1275
00:48:50,880 --> 00:48:52,800
preserving solution to detect illegal

1276
00:48:52,800 --> 00:48:54,319
content

1277
00:48:54,319 --> 00:48:56,800
secondly we showed that css is not a

1278
00:48:56,800 --> 00:48:57,760
robust solution

1279
00:48:57,760 --> 00:49:01,119
and almost always an image can be

1280
00:49:01,119 --> 00:49:03,359
modified to avoid detection in even in a

1281
00:49:03,359 --> 00:49:05,599
black box setup that is the proposed

1282
00:49:05,599 --> 00:49:08,800
way of how it will be implemented and

1283
00:49:08,800 --> 00:49:10,720
lastly we showed that defenses to

1284
00:49:10,720 --> 00:49:12,800
improve robustness of such systems

1285
00:49:12,800 --> 00:49:17,040
don't work we have the paper is

1286
00:49:17,040 --> 00:49:18,000
available

1287
00:49:18,000 --> 00:49:20,240
on archive you can look at it this work

1288
00:49:20,240 --> 00:49:21,839
was done in collaboration

1289
00:49:21,839 --> 00:49:23,839
with my colleagues anna maria and eva

1290
00:49:23,839 --> 00:49:25,599
exam at imperial college london

1291
00:49:25,599 --> 00:49:27,359
you can follow us on our twitter thank

1292
00:49:27,359 --> 00:49:28,880
you for that and

1293
00:49:28,880 --> 00:49:32,960
this currently under review thank you

1294
00:49:35,359 --> 00:49:37,760
okay thank you very much for another

1295
00:49:37,760 --> 00:49:39,119
interesting talk

1296
00:49:39,119 --> 00:49:42,960
um so we now have plenty of time for qa

1297
00:49:42,960 --> 00:49:43,599
i will

1298
00:49:43,599 --> 00:49:46,880
share my screen again just to put the

1299
00:49:46,880 --> 00:49:50,880
um the talks that we just saw back up so

1300
00:49:50,880 --> 00:49:53,280
you could remember everybody's names and

1301
00:49:53,280 --> 00:49:55,920
so on to help uh facilitate the

1302
00:49:55,920 --> 00:49:57,119
discussion and

1303
00:49:57,119 --> 00:49:58,960
please if you have questions ask in the

1304
00:49:58,960 --> 00:50:00,800
chat or be like ian and hop right up to

1305
00:50:00,800 --> 00:50:04,800
the mic and just start talking
