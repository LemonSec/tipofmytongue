00:00:00,399 --> 00:00:03,439
hello i'm peter nay i'm a postdoc in the

2
00:00:03,439 --> 00:00:04,960
university of washington

3
00:00:04,960 --> 00:00:06,319
and today i'm going to talk about work

4
00:00:06,319 --> 00:00:08,639
we did looking at dna sequencing flow

5
00:00:08,639 --> 00:00:09,360
cells

6
00:00:09,360 --> 00:00:10,719
and the security of the molecular

7
00:00:10,719 --> 00:00:12,799
digital interface now before

8
00:00:12,799 --> 00:00:14,799
getting into describing the details of

9
00:00:14,799 --> 00:00:16,400
our work i'm going to start with a quick

10
00:00:16,400 --> 00:00:19,840
overview of how dna sequencing works

11
00:00:19,840 --> 00:00:21,520
dna sequencing is the biochemical

12
00:00:21,520 --> 00:00:23,600
process used to read

13
00:00:23,600 --> 00:00:25,199
the information that's encoded in

14
00:00:25,199 --> 00:00:27,039
physical dna molecules

15
00:00:27,039 --> 00:00:28,640
and convert that information into a

16
00:00:28,640 --> 00:00:30,480
digital form

17
00:00:30,480 --> 00:00:32,479
in practice this means determining the

18
00:00:32,479 --> 00:00:34,880
linear sequence of dna bases

19
00:00:34,880 --> 00:00:37,760
also known as acg and t that make up

20
00:00:37,760 --> 00:00:39,200
each of the dna molecules within a

21
00:00:39,200 --> 00:00:41,040
sample

22
00:00:41,040 --> 00:00:43,280
in recent years modern dna sequencing

23
00:00:43,280 --> 00:00:44,079
technology has

24
00:00:44,079 --> 00:00:46,000
improved enough so that high-throughput

25
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:48,399
dna sequencers are capable of sequencing

26
00:00:48,399 --> 00:00:50,160
hundreds of millions of dna molecules

27
00:00:50,160 --> 00:00:52,399
within a sample at the same time

28
00:00:52,399 --> 00:00:56,719
which enables users to sequence up to

29
00:00:56,719 --> 00:00:59,440
multiple human genomes at the same time

30
00:00:59,440 --> 00:01:00,800
and this has led to an exponential

31
00:01:00,800 --> 00:01:01,359
increase

32
00:01:01,359 --> 00:01:02,800
in the amount of dna sequencing that's

33
00:01:02,800 --> 00:01:04,720
done

34
00:01:04,720 --> 00:01:06,479
and because of this dna sequencing has

35
00:01:06,479 --> 00:01:08,640
become important to a number of domains

36
00:01:08,640 --> 00:01:11,040
including medicine for medical diagnosis

37
00:01:11,040 --> 00:01:12,799
genomics for research

38
00:01:12,799 --> 00:01:15,520
forensics for sample identification and

39
00:01:15,520 --> 00:01:15,920
uh

40
00:01:15,920 --> 00:01:17,360
novel applications like familial

41
00:01:17,360 --> 00:01:19,360
searches which allows users to

42
00:01:19,360 --> 00:01:21,200
try to identify close relatives just

43
00:01:21,200 --> 00:01:23,200
using genetic information

44
00:01:23,200 --> 00:01:24,479
however there are a number of

45
00:01:24,479 --> 00:01:27,119
applications in the dna sequencing world

46
00:01:27,119 --> 00:01:30,720
that leverage dna and dna sequencing

47
00:01:30,720 --> 00:01:33,680
for what would typically be associated

48
00:01:33,680 --> 00:01:34,000
as

49
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:37,119
digital purposes and probably the most

50
00:01:37,119 --> 00:01:39,119
well-known example of this is a field

51
00:01:39,119 --> 00:01:40,720
called dna data storage

52
00:01:40,720 --> 00:01:44,079
which tries to use synthetic dna to both

53
00:01:44,079 --> 00:01:46,399
write and read information from dna

54
00:01:46,399 --> 00:01:47,600
molecules

55
00:01:47,600 --> 00:01:48,960
and the reason you might do this is

56
00:01:48,960 --> 00:01:51,920
because dna is highly stable and can

57
00:01:51,920 --> 00:01:54,399
last for hundreds of years and

58
00:01:54,399 --> 00:01:56,000
because dna is the information carrier

59
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:57,600
for life we can assume that we're going

60
00:01:57,600 --> 00:01:58,960
to have technology that's capable of

61
00:01:58,960 --> 00:01:59,680
reading

62
00:01:59,680 --> 00:02:02,960
dna for a long time so when viewed

63
00:02:02,960 --> 00:02:04,479
abstractly you can actually think of a

64
00:02:04,479 --> 00:02:05,600
dna sequencer

65
00:02:05,600 --> 00:02:07,040
as something like an interface which

66
00:02:07,040 --> 00:02:10,000
straddles the molecular in digital realm

67
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:11,840
and this is important because this means

68
00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:13,680
that issues or problems or design

69
00:02:13,680 --> 00:02:14,400
decisions

70
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:16,080
that take place in the molecular realm

71
00:02:16,080 --> 00:02:17,520
can actually influence and

72
00:02:17,520 --> 00:02:20,879
impact the digital world

73
00:02:21,040 --> 00:02:22,560
so all of this got us interested in

74
00:02:22,560 --> 00:02:24,080
understanding the security and privacy

75
00:02:24,080 --> 00:02:25,840
implications of a specific piece of

76
00:02:25,840 --> 00:02:27,520
hardware within a sequencer

77
00:02:27,520 --> 00:02:29,840
called a sequencing flow cell and the

78
00:02:29,840 --> 00:02:30,959
flow cell is important

79
00:02:30,959 --> 00:02:32,480
because it's actually the site of the

80
00:02:32,480 --> 00:02:34,160
molecular digital conversion and is

81
00:02:34,160 --> 00:02:36,959
where sequencing takes place

82
00:02:36,959 --> 00:02:39,120
right now there's two main classes of

83
00:02:39,120 --> 00:02:40,560
sequencing flow cells

84
00:02:40,560 --> 00:02:42,160
that are used in practice one made by

85
00:02:42,160 --> 00:02:44,800
alumina and the other by oxford nanopore

86
00:02:44,800 --> 00:02:47,840
in this work we focus on the flow cells

87
00:02:47,840 --> 00:02:50,480
created by alumina which use a

88
00:02:50,480 --> 00:02:51,760
sequencing by synthesis

89
00:02:51,760 --> 00:02:54,640
type sequencing technology sequencing by

90
00:02:54,640 --> 00:02:57,360
synthesis works as follows

91
00:02:57,360 --> 00:02:59,440
first a dna sample is pre-prepared in

92
00:02:59,440 --> 00:03:01,040
the wet lab to make it ready for

93
00:03:01,040 --> 00:03:02,159
sequencing

94
00:03:02,159 --> 00:03:03,599
this usually results in each of the

95
00:03:03,599 --> 00:03:05,440
molecules in the sample being somewhere

96
00:03:05,440 --> 00:03:07,360
in the order of 100 to 300 bases in

97
00:03:07,360 --> 00:03:08,640
length

98
00:03:08,640 --> 00:03:12,159
next these short dna molecules are

99
00:03:12,159 --> 00:03:14,400
washed over a flow cell surface which is

100
00:03:14,400 --> 00:03:16,319
sticky so that the dna molecules

101
00:03:16,319 --> 00:03:18,400
bind to the flow cell surface where each

102
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:19,760
of them can then be individually

103
00:03:19,760 --> 00:03:20,640
sequenced

104
00:03:20,640 --> 00:03:23,120
by detecting different fluorescent

105
00:03:23,120 --> 00:03:24,959
signatures for each of the bases that

106
00:03:24,959 --> 00:03:26,400
are being added

107
00:03:26,400 --> 00:03:28,159
these signatures are picked up by high

108
00:03:28,159 --> 00:03:29,920
resolution cameras which can then be

109
00:03:29,920 --> 00:03:31,840
used to reconstruct the sequence of each

110
00:03:31,840 --> 00:03:34,239
of the separate dna molecules

111
00:03:34,239 --> 00:03:36,560
this then results in a large dna

112
00:03:36,560 --> 00:03:38,239
sequencing file containing

113
00:03:38,239 --> 00:03:40,400
the sequence of each of the strands one

114
00:03:40,400 --> 00:03:41,280
after the other

115
00:03:41,280 --> 00:03:43,040
usually hundreds of millions of strands

116
00:03:43,040 --> 00:03:45,440
per sequencing file

117
00:03:45,440 --> 00:03:47,519
because dna sequencing flow cells are so

118
00:03:47,519 --> 00:03:49,519
integral to the sequencing process

119
00:03:49,519 --> 00:03:51,760
we wanted to ask whether flow cell

120
00:03:51,760 --> 00:03:53,519
design and architecture

121
00:03:53,519 --> 00:03:54,959
could have security and privacy

122
00:03:54,959 --> 00:03:57,280
implications in particular

123
00:03:57,280 --> 00:03:58,400
we thought they were interesting to

124
00:03:58,400 --> 00:04:01,599
study because unlike a lot of

125
00:04:01,599 --> 00:04:03,280
computational platforms they actually

126
00:04:03,280 --> 00:04:04,640
process molecules

127
00:04:04,640 --> 00:04:06,319
as opposed to being more of an

128
00:04:06,319 --> 00:04:07,680
electronic variety

129
00:04:07,680 --> 00:04:08,799
and molecules have interesting

130
00:04:08,799 --> 00:04:10,400
properties so for example they can

131
00:04:10,400 --> 00:04:11,040
diffuse

132
00:04:11,040 --> 00:04:12,799
react and can be stable for long periods

133
00:04:12,799 --> 00:04:14,159
of time which all might have

134
00:04:14,159 --> 00:04:14,959
implications

135
00:04:14,959 --> 00:04:18,160
for security and privacy

136
00:04:18,399 --> 00:04:20,000
in particular we were interested in

137
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:21,839
understanding two issues

138
00:04:21,839 --> 00:04:25,600
the first was whether dna left on a flow

139
00:04:25,600 --> 00:04:27,360
cell could act somewhat like

140
00:04:27,360 --> 00:04:29,280
a hard drive with data that wasn't

141
00:04:29,280 --> 00:04:31,520
properly deleted and so for example

142
00:04:31,520 --> 00:04:33,280
could this lead to something like data

143
00:04:33,280 --> 00:04:34,639
remnants issue

144
00:04:34,639 --> 00:04:36,160
and the second issue as i'll describe

145
00:04:36,160 --> 00:04:37,759
later in the talk is that sequencing is

146
00:04:37,759 --> 00:04:39,280
actually done in parallel with multiple

147
00:04:39,280 --> 00:04:40,960
samples to increase throughput

148
00:04:40,960 --> 00:04:42,880
which raises issues of parallelism and

149
00:04:42,880 --> 00:04:44,000
concurrency

150
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:46,240
and possibilities of multi-tenancy

151
00:04:46,240 --> 00:04:47,199
problems

152
00:04:47,199 --> 00:04:48,400
similar to what we've seen in things

153
00:04:48,400 --> 00:04:51,359
like cloud environments

154
00:04:52,479 --> 00:04:55,360
data remnants is a well-known privacy

155
00:04:55,360 --> 00:04:56,000
issue

156
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:57,919
from classical hard drives both hard

157
00:04:57,919 --> 00:04:59,759
disks and solid state drives

158
00:04:59,759 --> 00:05:02,560
and it results when digital information

159
00:05:02,560 --> 00:05:03,440
is encoded

160
00:05:03,440 --> 00:05:05,919
in a storage medium and then when that

161
00:05:05,919 --> 00:05:07,680
file is deleted it isn't actually

162
00:05:07,680 --> 00:05:09,039
properly deleted because there's a

163
00:05:09,039 --> 00:05:10,800
remnant of it left on the physical

164
00:05:10,800 --> 00:05:11,680
storage media

165
00:05:11,680 --> 00:05:12,960
which can then be recovered using

166
00:05:12,960 --> 00:05:14,960
forensics techniques

167
00:05:14,960 --> 00:05:16,800
and similarly we wondered whether there

168
00:05:16,800 --> 00:05:18,000
was something analogous that was

169
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:18,639
happening

170
00:05:18,639 --> 00:05:21,280
with dna sequencing flow cells so for

171
00:05:21,280 --> 00:05:21,919
example

172
00:05:21,919 --> 00:05:23,759
if you were to sequence medical

173
00:05:23,759 --> 00:05:25,520
information or

174
00:05:25,520 --> 00:05:27,199
a human genome sample and were to

175
00:05:27,199 --> 00:05:29,520
dispose of the flow cell using standard

176
00:05:29,520 --> 00:05:32,320
disposal procedures could you actually

177
00:05:32,320 --> 00:05:34,320
recover the dna that was on that flow

178
00:05:34,320 --> 00:05:35,600
cell

179
00:05:35,600 --> 00:05:38,880
resequence it and recover

180
00:05:38,880 --> 00:05:40,639
most of the usable information that was

181
00:05:40,639 --> 00:05:43,039
from the original sample

182
00:05:43,039 --> 00:05:45,039
dna sequencing flow cells are designed

183
00:05:45,039 --> 00:05:46,320
to be single use

184
00:05:46,320 --> 00:05:47,919
and so our first question was whether

185
00:05:47,919 --> 00:05:49,759
it's possible to extract usable

186
00:05:49,759 --> 00:05:52,080
dna information from a flow cell that

187
00:05:52,080 --> 00:05:54,240
was used in a prior sequencing run

188
00:05:54,240 --> 00:05:55,520
and we thought this might be possible

189
00:05:55,520 --> 00:05:57,360
for a few reasons first

190
00:05:57,360 --> 00:05:59,280
dna is sticky and we thought there was a

191
00:05:59,280 --> 00:06:01,120
good chance that some dna would remain

192
00:06:01,120 --> 00:06:02,639
bound to the flow cell surface

193
00:06:02,639 --> 00:06:05,280
after sequencing was finished second

194
00:06:05,280 --> 00:06:06,000
dnase

195
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:07,759
is stable at room temperature and can

196
00:06:07,759 --> 00:06:10,240
last for months or years at a time

197
00:06:10,240 --> 00:06:13,280
still containing usable information

198
00:06:13,280 --> 00:06:16,400
third even low yields of dna

199
00:06:16,400 --> 00:06:18,880
may be recoverable because dna can be

200
00:06:18,880 --> 00:06:20,240
enzymatically amplified

201
00:06:20,240 --> 00:06:23,199
to increase its yield

202
00:06:23,280 --> 00:06:25,199
with this in mind we were able to

203
00:06:25,199 --> 00:06:27,280
develop a washing procedure which

204
00:06:27,280 --> 00:06:28,319
enabled us

205
00:06:28,319 --> 00:06:31,440
to collect residual dna left on a flow

206
00:06:31,440 --> 00:06:32,400
cell

207
00:06:32,400 --> 00:06:34,240
through a number of flushes we found

208
00:06:34,240 --> 00:06:36,479
that we're able to flush a flow cell

209
00:06:36,479 --> 00:06:38,720
five times with fluid and still collect

210
00:06:38,720 --> 00:06:39,520
a usable

211
00:06:39,520 --> 00:06:42,400
yield of dna and in particular this

212
00:06:42,400 --> 00:06:43,360
residual dna

213
00:06:43,360 --> 00:06:45,600
could be easily amplified due to the

214
00:06:45,600 --> 00:06:48,319
design of the dna molecules that was

215
00:06:48,319 --> 00:06:49,199
specified

216
00:06:49,199 --> 00:06:53,680
in the pre-sequencing wet lab process

217
00:06:53,680 --> 00:06:55,440
therefore we had a simple method to both

218
00:06:55,440 --> 00:06:57,199
collect residual dna

219
00:06:57,199 --> 00:06:58,880
and increase its yield with enzymatic

220
00:06:58,880 --> 00:07:00,960
amplification

221
00:07:00,960 --> 00:07:02,400
and while the previous experiment showed

222
00:07:02,400 --> 00:07:04,160
that we could collect some

223
00:07:04,160 --> 00:07:06,400
residual quantities of dna it wasn't

224
00:07:06,400 --> 00:07:07,599
clear whether this dna

225
00:07:07,599 --> 00:07:08,720
actually contained any useful

226
00:07:08,720 --> 00:07:11,440
information and so to test this

227
00:07:11,440 --> 00:07:13,360
we ran two different sequencing

228
00:07:13,360 --> 00:07:15,599
experiments with an illumina sequencer

229
00:07:15,599 --> 00:07:17,039
trying to understand whether we could

230
00:07:17,039 --> 00:07:19,039
recover information in a high redundancy

231
00:07:19,039 --> 00:07:20,400
environment

232
00:07:20,400 --> 00:07:22,560
one with lots of error correction in

233
00:07:22,560 --> 00:07:25,039
this case a dna data storage

234
00:07:25,039 --> 00:07:27,120
file with a number of images and

235
00:07:27,120 --> 00:07:28,319
secondly

236
00:07:28,319 --> 00:07:30,800
more of a medical context or genomics

237
00:07:30,800 --> 00:07:32,160
context where we actually wanted to

238
00:07:32,160 --> 00:07:32,720
sequence

239
00:07:32,720 --> 00:07:34,400
a human genome sample and see what

240
00:07:34,400 --> 00:07:38,560
fraction of that genome we could recover

241
00:07:38,880 --> 00:07:40,639
in the first experiment we tried to

242
00:07:40,639 --> 00:07:43,360
recover dna from a used flow cell

243
00:07:43,360 --> 00:07:46,000
where the dna originated from a sample

244
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:46,800
that encoded

245
00:07:46,800 --> 00:07:49,840
a number of digital images this allowed

246
00:07:49,840 --> 00:07:51,919
us to understand how residual dna

247
00:07:51,919 --> 00:07:54,240
recovery might work from a sample with a

248
00:07:54,240 --> 00:07:55,680
high level of redundancy

249
00:07:55,680 --> 00:07:57,680
which is typical in a dna data storage

250
00:07:57,680 --> 00:08:00,319
file and in fact we were able to

251
00:08:00,319 --> 00:08:03,360
fully recover the images from the dna

252
00:08:03,360 --> 00:08:05,440
left on a used flow cell

253
00:08:05,440 --> 00:08:07,520
more interestingly there were

254
00:08:07,520 --> 00:08:08,720
significantly more

255
00:08:08,720 --> 00:08:10,560
substitution rates which are flips

256
00:08:10,560 --> 00:08:12,400
between bases

257
00:08:12,400 --> 00:08:14,240
in this case about six times higher in

258
00:08:14,240 --> 00:08:16,000
the residual sequencing run

259
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:18,479
than the original run we suspect largely

260
00:08:18,479 --> 00:08:20,479
due to the additional amplification of

261
00:08:20,479 --> 00:08:21,440
the dna we did

262
00:08:21,440 --> 00:08:24,560
as part of our recovery seizure however

263
00:08:24,560 --> 00:08:25,840
we did notice that there were similar

264
00:08:25,840 --> 00:08:27,919
error rates of other kinds of errors

265
00:08:27,919 --> 00:08:30,000
and in particular they were still well

266
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:31,840
within the error correction budget

267
00:08:31,840 --> 00:08:34,640
that was allowed by the dna data storage

268
00:08:34,640 --> 00:08:37,440
decoding process

269
00:08:37,440 --> 00:08:39,360
next we wanted to understand how data

270
00:08:39,360 --> 00:08:41,440
remnants issues might affect

271
00:08:41,440 --> 00:08:43,839
a more natural or biological dna sample

272
00:08:43,839 --> 00:08:46,720
with much lower levels of redundancy

273
00:08:46,720 --> 00:08:48,880
and when we repeated the same process of

274
00:08:48,880 --> 00:08:50,399
trying to recover

275
00:08:50,399 --> 00:08:52,240
a human genome sample from a used flow

276
00:08:52,240 --> 00:08:54,080
cell we found that in fact yes

277
00:08:54,080 --> 00:08:56,399
we did recover significantly less of

278
00:08:56,399 --> 00:08:57,120
that sample

279
00:08:57,120 --> 00:08:59,680
than the original run however there was

280
00:08:59,680 --> 00:09:01,360
still a substantial amount of unique

281
00:09:01,360 --> 00:09:03,279
data that we were able to pull from it

282
00:09:03,279 --> 00:09:05,200
in particular we were able to recover

283
00:09:05,200 --> 00:09:07,279
about 1.8 million

284
00:09:07,279 --> 00:09:09,839
strands from the second residual

285
00:09:09,839 --> 00:09:10,720
sequencing run

286
00:09:10,720 --> 00:09:13,519
compared to 4.4 million in the original

287
00:09:13,519 --> 00:09:14,800
interestingly

288
00:09:14,800 --> 00:09:16,480
around half of that dna was never

289
00:09:16,480 --> 00:09:18,480
actually seen in the original sample

290
00:09:18,480 --> 00:09:19,920
implying that we're actually pulling new

291
00:09:19,920 --> 00:09:21,440
dna that was not sequenced in the

292
00:09:21,440 --> 00:09:22,480
original sample

293
00:09:22,480 --> 00:09:25,839
when we do our washing procedure however

294
00:09:25,839 --> 00:09:28,000
in terms of actual usable information

295
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:29,440
this was a significant amount of

296
00:09:29,440 --> 00:09:30,160
recovery

297
00:09:30,160 --> 00:09:32,160
because there is some amount of

298
00:09:32,160 --> 00:09:34,320
duplication that naturally occurs

299
00:09:34,320 --> 00:09:36,720
in a typical medical or genomic

300
00:09:36,720 --> 00:09:38,000
sequencing process

301
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:41,839
and so in general you expect around 30x

302
00:09:41,839 --> 00:09:43,680
coverage which means on average each

303
00:09:43,680 --> 00:09:45,519
base has about 30

304
00:09:45,519 --> 00:09:48,160
dna molecules which encodes that base

305
00:09:48,160 --> 00:09:50,080
and in our recovery procedure we were

306
00:09:50,080 --> 00:09:52,000
getting more in the order of 10 to 15

307
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:54,560
x recovery so it's not quite equal to

308
00:09:54,560 --> 00:09:55,519
the original run

309
00:09:55,519 --> 00:09:57,279
but it's still a significant amount and

310
00:09:57,279 --> 00:09:58,880
an amount that would allow you to

311
00:09:58,880 --> 00:10:01,360
determine most of the interesting

312
00:10:01,360 --> 00:10:04,160
genetic information in a sample

313
00:10:04,160 --> 00:10:06,320
so in summary when looking at data

314
00:10:06,320 --> 00:10:08,079
remnants issues on flow cells

315
00:10:08,079 --> 00:10:10,240
we were able to develop a recovery

316
00:10:10,240 --> 00:10:11,920
procedure

317
00:10:11,920 --> 00:10:14,640
that allowed us to collect and amplify

318
00:10:14,640 --> 00:10:15,200
dna

319
00:10:15,200 --> 00:10:17,920
such that we could recover most of the

320
00:10:17,920 --> 00:10:18,480
dna

321
00:10:18,480 --> 00:10:20,959
in a dna data storage or high redundancy

322
00:10:20,959 --> 00:10:21,680
context

323
00:10:21,680 --> 00:10:24,240
as well as in a lower redundancy context

324
00:10:24,240 --> 00:10:26,320
like medicine and human genomics but in

325
00:10:26,320 --> 00:10:28,240
both cases

326
00:10:28,240 --> 00:10:30,079
it was sufficient for a significant

327
00:10:30,079 --> 00:10:31,279
amount of recovery

328
00:10:31,279 --> 00:10:34,320
raising security and privacy issues for

329
00:10:34,320 --> 00:10:37,200
flow cell disposal in the paper we

330
00:10:37,200 --> 00:10:38,640
discuss the number of defenses

331
00:10:38,640 --> 00:10:41,279
and solutions to this problem please see

332
00:10:41,279 --> 00:10:43,519
that for more details

333
00:10:43,519 --> 00:10:45,360
the second question we had with regards

334
00:10:45,360 --> 00:10:47,760
to flow cells and security and privacy

335
00:10:47,760 --> 00:10:50,079
was how issues of parallelism and

336
00:10:50,079 --> 00:10:51,839
multi-tenancy could affect security and

337
00:10:51,839 --> 00:10:53,279
privacy

338
00:10:53,279 --> 00:10:54,880
in particular we were interested in

339
00:10:54,880 --> 00:10:56,480
studying the security and privacy

340
00:10:56,480 --> 00:10:57,519
implications

341
00:10:57,519 --> 00:11:00,160
of a multiplexing procedure that's done

342
00:11:00,160 --> 00:11:01,120
often

343
00:11:01,120 --> 00:11:02,399
in high throughput sequencing

344
00:11:02,399 --> 00:11:05,600
environments and this process allows

345
00:11:05,600 --> 00:11:08,640
up to 96 separate unique dna samples

346
00:11:08,640 --> 00:11:10,560
to be concurrently sequenced on the

347
00:11:10,560 --> 00:11:12,240
sequencer on the same flow cell at the

348
00:11:12,240 --> 00:11:13,120
same time

349
00:11:13,120 --> 00:11:14,560
and then later the data from that

350
00:11:14,560 --> 00:11:16,640
sequencing run is demultiplexed

351
00:11:16,640 --> 00:11:18,720
into data for each of these individual

352
00:11:18,720 --> 00:11:20,480
samples

353
00:11:20,480 --> 00:11:22,240
and this is done using what are called

354
00:11:22,240 --> 00:11:23,920
chemical barcodes

355
00:11:23,920 --> 00:11:26,320
which are enzymatically added to each of

356
00:11:26,320 --> 00:11:27,440
the dna molecules

357
00:11:27,440 --> 00:11:29,839
in the sample before sequencing so this

358
00:11:29,839 --> 00:11:31,440
occurs during the pre-sequencing

359
00:11:31,440 --> 00:11:32,800
procedure

360
00:11:32,800 --> 00:11:35,360
and what happens is each sample is given

361
00:11:35,360 --> 00:11:36,640
a unique barcode

362
00:11:36,640 --> 00:11:39,360
so that when that molecule is sequenced

363
00:11:39,360 --> 00:11:41,360
the barcode is read and can then be used

364
00:11:41,360 --> 00:11:42,720
to demultiplex

365
00:11:42,720 --> 00:11:46,880
that dna strand to the correct file

366
00:11:47,360 --> 00:11:49,920
the issue is that this demultiplexing

367
00:11:49,920 --> 00:11:50,800
procedure

368
00:11:50,800 --> 00:11:52,959
has a small but predictable amount of

369
00:11:52,959 --> 00:11:55,600
error and this error is referred to as

370
00:11:55,600 --> 00:11:58,720
barcode crosstalk and it's caused by

371
00:11:58,720 --> 00:12:00,720
both chemical issues on the flow cell as

372
00:12:00,720 --> 00:12:02,399
well as the way the flow cells are

373
00:12:02,399 --> 00:12:04,000
actually designed in the way that dna is

374
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:06,000
flowed over the flow cell surface

375
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:08,880
and what happens is that small numbers

376
00:12:08,880 --> 00:12:09,600
of reads

377
00:12:09,600 --> 00:12:11,279
somewhere in the order of point zero

378
00:12:11,279 --> 00:12:13,360
zero zero one percent to point one

379
00:12:13,360 --> 00:12:14,240
percent

380
00:12:14,240 --> 00:12:17,200
are actually assigned to the wrong file

381
00:12:17,200 --> 00:12:18,880
and so in a typical sequencing run this

382
00:12:18,880 --> 00:12:20,399
could be somewhere in the order of

383
00:12:20,399 --> 00:12:22,839
two hundred to two hundred thousand dna

384
00:12:22,839 --> 00:12:24,880
reads

385
00:12:24,880 --> 00:12:26,959
now previous work has looked at this

386
00:12:26,959 --> 00:12:28,480
crosstalk phenomena

387
00:12:28,480 --> 00:12:30,800
and found that it was possible to use

388
00:12:30,800 --> 00:12:31,680
crosstalk

389
00:12:31,680 --> 00:12:34,720
to predictably read information or small

390
00:12:34,720 --> 00:12:36,399
amounts of information from other dna

391
00:12:36,399 --> 00:12:37,680
samples

392
00:12:37,680 --> 00:12:39,040
but in this work we were actually

393
00:12:39,040 --> 00:12:40,720
interested in understanding the reverse

394
00:12:40,720 --> 00:12:41,760
of that process

395
00:12:41,760 --> 00:12:44,800
which is could one malicious sample

396
00:12:44,800 --> 00:12:46,880
use crosstalk to actually write

397
00:12:46,880 --> 00:12:49,360
information into other data files

398
00:12:49,360 --> 00:12:50,959
and in particular trying to understand

399
00:12:50,959 --> 00:12:52,720
what the security implications could be

400
00:12:52,720 --> 00:12:56,000
of these unauthorized rights and in

401
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:57,120
general these risks are going to be

402
00:12:57,120 --> 00:12:58,959
specific to the downstream

403
00:12:58,959 --> 00:13:00,720
processing and analysis that's done with

404
00:13:00,720 --> 00:13:03,120
that sequencing data

405
00:13:03,120 --> 00:13:04,639
in this work we were interested in

406
00:13:04,639 --> 00:13:06,720
studying a specific kind of analysis

407
00:13:06,720 --> 00:13:08,880
called variant calling and variant

408
00:13:08,880 --> 00:13:10,639
calling is a very common

409
00:13:10,639 --> 00:13:13,279
genetic technique to try to identify

410
00:13:13,279 --> 00:13:14,480
differences

411
00:13:14,480 --> 00:13:17,600
in an individual genomic sample so in

412
00:13:17,600 --> 00:13:20,000
this case the goal is to identify

413
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:22,639
markers in a genomic sample which differ

414
00:13:22,639 --> 00:13:23,120
from

415
00:13:23,120 --> 00:13:25,360
the standard reference sequence and

416
00:13:25,360 --> 00:13:27,360
recall that in a human sample

417
00:13:27,360 --> 00:13:29,519
humans have 23 chromosomes these

418
00:13:29,519 --> 00:13:30,480
chromosomes come

419
00:13:30,480 --> 00:13:32,839
in pairs therefore you actually are

420
00:13:32,839 --> 00:13:34,000
determining

421
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:37,200
pairs of markers at each position

422
00:13:37,200 --> 00:13:39,120
recall that dna sequencers are designed

423
00:13:39,120 --> 00:13:40,320
to only sequence

424
00:13:40,320 --> 00:13:42,800
short dna molecules and so what's

425
00:13:42,800 --> 00:13:44,399
actually done when sequencing a genomic

426
00:13:44,399 --> 00:13:44,959
sample

427
00:13:44,959 --> 00:13:48,000
is those long chromosomes which are

428
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:49,760
tens of thousands of bases long are

429
00:13:49,760 --> 00:13:51,600
broken up into small pieces

430
00:13:51,600 --> 00:13:54,880
each sequence is then

431
00:13:54,880 --> 00:13:57,600
aligned to a reference sequence using

432
00:13:57,600 --> 00:13:59,199
standard string alignment

433
00:13:59,199 --> 00:14:02,160
and then those markers of interest are

434
00:14:02,160 --> 00:14:03,199
evaluated

435
00:14:03,199 --> 00:14:06,000
statistically to see whether you would

436
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:07,920
have the genotype that you would expect

437
00:14:07,920 --> 00:14:10,639
so for example in this case if at marker

438
00:14:10,639 --> 00:14:11,440
one

439
00:14:11,440 --> 00:14:14,320
you have a t however all of the reads

440
00:14:14,320 --> 00:14:15,920
which align to that sequence from that

441
00:14:15,920 --> 00:14:17,040
genome sample have an

442
00:14:17,040 --> 00:14:18,959
a then you would expect that that

443
00:14:18,959 --> 00:14:20,480
genotype is

444
00:14:20,480 --> 00:14:23,440
two a's at that marker similarly if you

445
00:14:23,440 --> 00:14:24,160
have a

446
00:14:24,160 --> 00:14:26,079
g for that reference sequence and you

447
00:14:26,079 --> 00:14:27,600
were to do string alignment against that

448
00:14:27,600 --> 00:14:28,240
reference

449
00:14:28,240 --> 00:14:30,880
all of those dna reads if half are g and

450
00:14:30,880 --> 00:14:31,760
half are a

451
00:14:31,760 --> 00:14:34,480
you'd predict that the genotype at that

452
00:14:34,480 --> 00:14:36,320
marker for that sample is an a

453
00:14:36,320 --> 00:14:39,920
g now coming back to our original

454
00:14:39,920 --> 00:14:41,680
question as to whether you could use an

455
00:14:41,680 --> 00:14:44,320
unauthorized right in a malicious manner

456
00:14:44,320 --> 00:14:46,000
we wanted to ask the question as to

457
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:47,360
whether it was possible

458
00:14:47,360 --> 00:14:49,760
to write a sufficient number of

459
00:14:49,760 --> 00:14:51,680
molecules into another sample

460
00:14:51,680 --> 00:14:54,800
that would then effectively manipulate

461
00:14:54,800 --> 00:14:57,120
the variant calling algorithm

462
00:14:57,120 --> 00:14:59,920
so in this case imagine that you have a

463
00:14:59,920 --> 00:15:01,519
normal human genome sample

464
00:15:01,519 --> 00:15:04,480
which has two a's at a particular marker

465
00:15:04,480 --> 00:15:05,839
and if you were to write a bunch of

466
00:15:05,839 --> 00:15:06,800
strands with a t

467
00:15:06,800 --> 00:15:08,399
at that marker but were otherwise the

468
00:15:08,399 --> 00:15:10,240
same the question is would that be

469
00:15:10,240 --> 00:15:11,120
enough

470
00:15:11,120 --> 00:15:13,279
to modify the variant call that would be

471
00:15:13,279 --> 00:15:15,839
called it that marker

472
00:15:15,839 --> 00:15:18,480
in this case maybe flipping it from

473
00:15:18,480 --> 00:15:19,600
homozygous a

474
00:15:19,600 --> 00:15:25,120
a to an a t or even a tt

475
00:15:25,279 --> 00:15:26,880
and so what would happen if you did this

476
00:15:26,880 --> 00:15:28,240
if you were able to write a sufficient

477
00:15:28,240 --> 00:15:30,639
number of dna molecules containing a t

478
00:15:30,639 --> 00:15:32,079
which you would expect is all of these

479
00:15:32,079 --> 00:15:34,079
would then align to the same position

480
00:15:34,079 --> 00:15:35,839
except in this case the variant caller

481
00:15:35,839 --> 00:15:38,079
would statistically infer that yes maybe

482
00:15:38,079 --> 00:15:39,600
this is actually fifty percent a fifty

483
00:15:39,600 --> 00:15:41,360
percent t therefore we would expect

484
00:15:41,360 --> 00:15:44,480
that they are an a t at that location

485
00:15:44,480 --> 00:15:46,639
all right with this in mind we then went

486
00:15:46,639 --> 00:15:48,079
ahead and tried to

487
00:15:48,079 --> 00:15:49,920
design an experiment which then tested

488
00:15:49,920 --> 00:15:51,199
this hypothesis

489
00:15:51,199 --> 00:15:54,000
and so what we did was we started with

490
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:54,560
two

491
00:15:54,560 --> 00:15:57,120
samples the first sample was a standard

492
00:15:57,120 --> 00:15:58,399
human dna sample

493
00:15:58,399 --> 00:16:00,880
like before and the second was a

494
00:16:00,880 --> 00:16:02,720
malicious sample which contained just

495
00:16:02,720 --> 00:16:04,160
synthetic dna

496
00:16:04,160 --> 00:16:06,800
that was short 400 bases in length that

497
00:16:06,800 --> 00:16:08,399
was designed to look like

498
00:16:08,399 --> 00:16:10,800
a specific locus that we were targeting

499
00:16:10,800 --> 00:16:12,800
and the question was

500
00:16:12,800 --> 00:16:16,480
could we actually alter that marker

501
00:16:16,480 --> 00:16:18,240
in the human data even though those

502
00:16:18,240 --> 00:16:19,519
samples are supposed to remain

503
00:16:19,519 --> 00:16:21,279
independent

504
00:16:21,279 --> 00:16:23,199
and in particular what we tried to do

505
00:16:23,199 --> 00:16:24,320
was design

506
00:16:24,320 --> 00:16:27,680
synthetic molecules that looked like

507
00:16:27,680 --> 00:16:30,160
the marker which is responsible for

508
00:16:30,160 --> 00:16:31,279
sickle cell disease

509
00:16:31,279 --> 00:16:33,120
which is a single base substitution in

510
00:16:33,120 --> 00:16:35,120
the beta globin gene

511
00:16:35,120 --> 00:16:38,240
and so in effect the human sample which

512
00:16:38,240 --> 00:16:41,279
normally is a a which is a sign for uh

513
00:16:41,279 --> 00:16:43,040
being normal or not having sickle cell

514
00:16:43,040 --> 00:16:45,040
disease and change

515
00:16:45,040 --> 00:16:47,759
that person's variant calling status to

516
00:16:47,759 --> 00:16:50,160
either being a carrier which is at or

517
00:16:50,160 --> 00:16:52,720
disease status which is tt

518
00:16:52,720 --> 00:16:54,800
so we went ahead and ran this experiment

519
00:16:54,800 --> 00:16:56,240
and found that there was in fact

520
00:16:56,240 --> 00:16:58,639
enough crosstalk observed a very small

521
00:16:58,639 --> 00:16:59,600
amount in this case

522
00:16:59,600 --> 00:17:02,639
around 600 reads which was sufficient to

523
00:17:02,639 --> 00:17:04,160
manipulate the variant

524
00:17:04,160 --> 00:17:08,559
in the normal human dna sample

525
00:17:08,559 --> 00:17:11,919
in particular we were able to alter the

526
00:17:11,919 --> 00:17:14,720
genetic prediction for that sample from

527
00:17:14,720 --> 00:17:15,359
normal

528
00:17:15,359 --> 00:17:18,400
a a to a t which is uh

529
00:17:18,400 --> 00:17:20,400
signifies that that individual will be a

530
00:17:20,400 --> 00:17:23,599
sickle cell disease carrier

531
00:17:23,599 --> 00:17:25,439
so to conclude i'm going to discuss why

532
00:17:25,439 --> 00:17:27,760
i think this work has relevance for the

533
00:17:27,760 --> 00:17:30,720
computer security and privacy community

534
00:17:30,720 --> 00:17:33,039
and i think the first reason is that

535
00:17:33,039 --> 00:17:34,160
it's important to understand that

536
00:17:34,160 --> 00:17:36,400
state-of-the-art biological instruments

537
00:17:36,400 --> 00:17:38,559
like dna sequencers we studied in this

538
00:17:38,559 --> 00:17:40,160
work are actually becoming more

539
00:17:40,160 --> 00:17:41,840
computerized than ever before

540
00:17:41,840 --> 00:17:43,520
and this is starting to raise new

541
00:17:43,520 --> 00:17:45,120
computer security and privacy issues

542
00:17:45,120 --> 00:17:47,679
that haven't been previously considered

543
00:17:47,679 --> 00:17:49,440
and in particular in this case the

544
00:17:49,440 --> 00:17:51,200
vulnerabilities we uncovered were caused

545
00:17:51,200 --> 00:17:52,880
by complex interactions

546
00:17:52,880 --> 00:17:55,840
that involved molecular chemistry flow

547
00:17:55,840 --> 00:17:56,559
cell design

548
00:17:56,559 --> 00:17:58,720
and downstream data processing this is

549
00:17:58,720 --> 00:18:00,240
important because it means that

550
00:18:00,240 --> 00:18:01,919
reasoning about security and privacy is

551
00:18:01,919 --> 00:18:04,400
going to be hard and interdisciplinary

552
00:18:04,400 --> 00:18:06,960
and lastly i just say that we believe

553
00:18:06,960 --> 00:18:08,400
that improving security and privacy in

554
00:18:08,400 --> 00:18:09,200
the wet lab

555
00:18:09,200 --> 00:18:11,440
is going to continue to be a very

556
00:18:11,440 --> 00:18:12,799
important area to study

557
00:18:12,799 --> 00:18:15,840
especially given its high impact

558
00:18:15,840 --> 00:18:17,520
and with that i'd like to stop and ask

559
00:18:17,520 --> 00:18:18,799
for any questions thank you for

560
00:18:18,799 --> 00:18:21,600
listening
