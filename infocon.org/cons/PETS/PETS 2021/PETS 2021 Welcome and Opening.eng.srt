the general chair the team is super

6
00:00:10,559 --> 00:00:11,920
excited to have you here they've been

7
00:00:11,920 --> 00:00:13,440
working very hard to make sure that this

8
00:00:13,440 --> 00:00:15,599
is not just a series of youtube videos

9
00:00:15,599 --> 00:00:16,320
but an actual

10
00:00:16,320 --> 00:00:18,960
interactive community experience i want

11
00:00:18,960 --> 00:00:20,400
to highlight a few of the features that

12
00:00:20,400 --> 00:00:22,640
we're using to make that happen

13
00:00:22,640 --> 00:00:24,720
first of all there's the poster sessions

14
00:00:24,720 --> 00:00:26,160
happening after the talks

15
00:00:26,160 --> 00:00:29,279
and we had this at ccs and this was

16
00:00:29,279 --> 00:00:31,359
i think very helpful it's a short chance

17
00:00:31,359 --> 00:00:32,719
for you to catch

18
00:00:32,719 --> 00:00:34,480
the authors and talk with them about

19
00:00:34,480 --> 00:00:36,160
their work

20
00:00:36,160 --> 00:00:38,559
the q a time in the sessions is pretty

21
00:00:38,559 --> 00:00:40,079
limited but there is plenty of time

22
00:00:40,079 --> 00:00:41,760
during the poster session to discuss in

23
00:00:41,760 --> 00:00:43,600
more detail

24
00:00:43,600 --> 00:00:46,640

25
00:00:46,640 --> 00:00:48,320

26
00:00:48,320 --> 00:00:49,600

111
00:04:08,239 --> 00:04:11,200
privacy enhancing technology symposium

112
00:04:11,200 --> 00:04:11,920
we're

113
00:04:11,920 --> 00:04:13,599
again this year on the internet although

114
00:04:13,599 --> 00:04:15,599
in another sense we're

115
00:04:15,599 --> 00:04:17,600
at the rochester institute of technology

116
00:04:17,600 --> 00:04:19,680
uh that's thanks to a great team

117
00:04:19,680 --> 00:04:21,918
from rit uh that put together the

118
00:04:21,918 --> 00:04:23,840
logistics of this online event

119
00:04:23,840 --> 00:04:25,199
so thanks to the general chair matt

120
00:04:25,199 --> 00:04:26,639
wright and to the internet arrangement

121
00:04:26,639 --> 00:04:27,360
chairs

122
00:04:27,360 --> 00:04:31,919
hey johu sumita bishra and hani frabari

123
00:04:33,120 --> 00:04:35,040
pets can sit largely with a set of paper

124
00:04:35,040 --> 00:04:36,479
sessions

125
00:04:36,479 --> 00:04:39,520
um florian kirschbaum and i

126
00:04:39,520 --> 00:04:40,960
determined the program over the last

127
00:04:40,960 --> 00:04:43,360
year for accepting those papers

128
00:04:43,360 --> 00:04:45,280
but they came about largely as the

129
00:04:45,280 --> 00:04:47,199
result of a large number of authors and

130
00:04:47,199 --> 00:04:49,199
reviewers

131
00:04:49,199 --> 00:04:51,440
over the course of the last year we had

132
00:04:51,440 --> 00:04:52,880
submissions from

133
00:04:52,880 --> 00:04:56,080
124 distinct authors and they submitted

134
00:04:56,080 --> 00:05:00,000
435 papers to the conference

135
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:02,639
we ultimately accepted 81 of those which

136
00:05:02,639 --> 00:05:03,680
will be presented

137
00:05:03,680 --> 00:05:06,800
over the following days

138
00:05:06,800 --> 00:05:08,240
every paper that we got 40 and i

139
00:05:08,240 --> 00:05:10,000
assigned a set of reviewers

140
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:12,080
to look at the papers and decided that

141
00:05:12,080 --> 00:05:14,240
merits acceptance into the conference

142
00:05:14,240 --> 00:05:15,680
we had a large program committee this

143
00:05:15,680 --> 00:05:17,920
year 138 program committee members

144
00:05:17,920 --> 00:05:19,280
[Music]

145
00:05:19,280 --> 00:05:22,000
each of whom did about 10 or 12 reviews

146
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:23,680
over the course of the year

147
00:05:23,680 --> 00:05:26,000
we also manage a large external review

148
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:26,880
program

149
00:05:26,880 --> 00:05:30,320
we had 152 distinct external reviewers

150
00:05:30,320 --> 00:05:32,639
most of whom did one review but many of

151
00:05:32,639 --> 00:05:34,080
whom did more than one review over the

152
00:05:34,080 --> 00:05:34,960
year

153
00:05:34,960 --> 00:05:38,400
these reviewers are drawn from a pool of

154
00:05:38,400 --> 00:05:40,000
mostly junior reviewers recommended by

155
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:41,360
members of the community

156
00:05:41,360 --> 00:05:44,000
and so we thank all of our reviewers for

157
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:46,000
the efforts that they put into

158
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:48,479
coming up with the program there's a lot

159
00:05:48,479 --> 00:05:50,479
of effort involved we had almost 1500

160
00:05:50,479 --> 00:05:51,039
reviews

161
00:05:51,039 --> 00:05:53,120
for those papers which is about three

162
00:05:53,120 --> 00:05:55,039
and a half reviews per paper

163
00:05:55,039 --> 00:05:56,880
every time a paper makes it all through

164
00:05:56,880 --> 00:05:58,400
the second phase of review we have a

165
00:05:58,400 --> 00:06:00,639
discussion phase to make final decision

166
00:06:00,639 --> 00:06:02,080
there's a lot of discussion on many

167
00:06:02,080 --> 00:06:04,000
papers we had

168
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:07,759
5300 comments overall discussing those

169
00:06:07,759 --> 00:06:11,039
435 submissions

170
00:06:12,560 --> 00:06:14,960
as you probably know pets operates uh in

171
00:06:14,960 --> 00:06:16,960
a hybrid journal conference model

172
00:06:16,960 --> 00:06:18,639
all papers are technically submitted to

173
00:06:18,639 --> 00:06:20,000
the journal proceedings on privacy and

174
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:21,759
cancer technologies popets

175
00:06:21,759 --> 00:06:23,039
and it's a quarterly joke so there are

176
00:06:23,039 --> 00:06:24,560
four issues every year you can see the

177
00:06:24,560 --> 00:06:25,120
number of

178
00:06:25,120 --> 00:06:26,800
papers submitted to every issue and the

179
00:06:26,800 --> 00:06:29,919
number of papers is accepted

180
00:06:30,720 --> 00:06:32,639
every issue we receive more and more

181
00:06:32,639 --> 00:06:34,080
papers and this is

182
00:06:34,080 --> 00:06:37,199
um significantly more than

183
00:06:37,199 --> 00:06:39,840
similar issues last year by the issue

184
00:06:39,840 --> 00:06:41,120
four we were receiving

185
00:06:41,120 --> 00:06:43,600
i think 30 more than the same issue in

186
00:06:43,600 --> 00:06:45,039
the previous year

187
00:06:45,039 --> 00:06:46,400
although acceptance rates stayed about

188
00:06:46,400 --> 00:06:49,759
the same between 16 and 20 percent

189
00:06:49,759 --> 00:06:52,560
overall we accepted i think 18.6 percent

190
00:06:52,560 --> 00:06:55,039
of papers

191
00:06:57,199 --> 00:06:59,039
we divided those papers for presentation

192
00:06:59,039 --> 00:07:01,039
into a set of paper sessions

193
00:07:01,039 --> 00:07:04,639
for 81 papers we ultimately needed 21

194
00:07:04,639 --> 00:07:05,360
sections

195
00:07:05,360 --> 00:07:08,000
we divided them into seven sessions of

196
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:09,039
three parallel tracks

197
00:07:09,039 --> 00:07:12,000
a through c you can see from the

198
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:13,280
subjects of these

199
00:07:13,280 --> 00:07:15,840
sessions uh some of the popular topics

200
00:07:15,840 --> 00:07:16,639
uh which

201
00:07:16,639 --> 00:07:18,400
included private machine learning

202
00:07:18,400 --> 00:07:19,919
several sessions of

203
00:07:19,919 --> 00:07:23,599
on that subject data privacy uh

204
00:07:23,599 --> 00:07:26,560
cryptography of various forms uh and

205
00:07:26,560 --> 00:07:27,759

207
00:07:29,520 --> 00:07:31,840
