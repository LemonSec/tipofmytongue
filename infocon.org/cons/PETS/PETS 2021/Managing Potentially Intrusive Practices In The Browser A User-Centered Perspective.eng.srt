00:00:01,040 --> 00:00:03,679
hello my name is daniel smolin and today

2
00:00:03,679 --> 00:00:05,040
i'll be presenting our work

3
00:00:05,040 --> 00:00:07,120
titled managing potentially intrusive

4
00:00:07,120 --> 00:00:08,559
practices in the browser

5
00:00:08,559 --> 00:00:16,400
a user-centered perspective today

6
00:00:16,400 --> 00:00:18,080
web browsing is a really tricky

7
00:00:18,080 --> 00:00:20,400
situation because on different websites

8
00:00:20,400 --> 00:00:22,320
there's many different data practices

9
00:00:22,320 --> 00:00:24,160
and not everybody feels the same way

10
00:00:24,160 --> 00:00:26,720
about them some people see practices as

11
00:00:26,720 --> 00:00:27,199
good

12
00:00:27,199 --> 00:00:28,960
they can make browsing safer more

13
00:00:28,960 --> 00:00:31,359
relevant potentially even more useful

14
00:00:31,359 --> 00:00:33,840
and some practices can be seen as bad

15
00:00:33,840 --> 00:00:35,760
some people see them as intrusive or too

16
00:00:35,760 --> 00:00:36,640
complex

17
00:00:36,640 --> 00:00:40,320
and they can be difficult to understand

18
00:00:42,640 --> 00:00:44,719
in this work we use the term potentially

19
00:00:44,719 --> 00:00:46,079
intrusive practices

20
00:00:46,079 --> 00:00:47,760
to generically refer to common

21
00:00:47,760 --> 00:00:49,440
third-party tracking methods

22
00:00:49,440 --> 00:00:51,520
this includes fingerprinting as well as

23
00:00:51,520 --> 00:00:53,039
other types of scripts that run in the

24
00:00:53,039 --> 00:00:54,800
browser to collect data

25
00:00:54,800 --> 00:00:56,960
monitor activity redirect users

26
00:00:56,960 --> 00:00:59,120
attention or operate in the background

27
00:00:59,120 --> 00:01:00,800
to gather something of value

28
00:01:00,800 --> 00:01:03,359
but note in our study we refer to these

29
00:01:03,359 --> 00:01:04,720
practices neutrally

30
00:01:04,720 --> 00:01:06,479
using terminology such as web

31
00:01:06,479 --> 00:01:08,720
technologies and i'll discuss more about

32
00:01:08,720 --> 00:01:13,600
why we did that a little later

33
00:01:13,600 --> 00:01:15,200
fundamentally whether or not an

34
00:01:15,200 --> 00:01:17,600
intrusive practice is a problem for you

35
00:01:17,600 --> 00:01:20,080
depends on many factors it can depend on

36
00:01:20,080 --> 00:01:21,119
your preferences

37
00:01:21,119 --> 00:01:22,960
or the type of website you're browsing

38
00:01:22,960 --> 00:01:24,479
or what you're doing there

39
00:01:24,479 --> 00:01:26,240
as well as how security and privacy

40
00:01:26,240 --> 00:01:28,240
conscious you are your confidence in the

41
00:01:28,240 --> 00:01:30,320
ability to control data practices

42
00:01:30,320 --> 00:01:32,159
and even what you actually have control

43
00:01:32,159 --> 00:01:34,320
over as well as potentially many more

44
00:01:34,320 --> 00:01:35,360
factors

45
00:01:35,360 --> 00:01:37,280
but where harms occur is when your

46
00:01:37,280 --> 00:01:39,040
expectations don't match with your

47
00:01:39,040 --> 00:01:40,400
browsing experience

48
00:01:40,400 --> 00:01:42,640
so being able to manage what you're okay

49
00:01:42,640 --> 00:01:44,000
or not okay with

50
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:47,040
is really crucial

51
00:01:47,119 --> 00:01:49,280
so that's why the aim of the study is to

52
00:01:49,280 --> 00:01:51,119
understand what users want

53
00:01:51,119 --> 00:01:53,439
what they actually get and to find ways

54
00:01:53,439 --> 00:01:57,119
to fill the gap between the two

55
00:01:57,360 --> 00:01:59,360
therefore we focused on a few key

56
00:01:59,360 --> 00:02:00,560
research questions

57
00:02:00,560 --> 00:02:02,640
first what are the signals that users

58
00:02:02,640 --> 00:02:04,399
rely on to determine that they're being

59
00:02:04,399 --> 00:02:06,240
subjected to intrusive practices

60
00:02:06,240 --> 00:02:09,038
or being protected from them second what

61
00:02:09,038 --> 00:02:11,120
affordances do users associate with

62
00:02:11,120 --> 00:02:13,920
enabling or disabling these practices

63
00:02:13,920 --> 00:02:15,760
third are there practices that users

64
00:02:15,760 --> 00:02:17,920
would want to control such as opting in

65
00:02:17,920 --> 00:02:19,920
or opting out of them and subject to

66
00:02:19,920 --> 00:02:22,239
what kind of contextual attributes

67
00:02:22,239 --> 00:02:24,319
and finally what practices do users

68
00:02:24,319 --> 00:02:26,000
prefer to be notified about

69
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:28,480
how often and in what sorts of contexts

70
00:02:28,480 --> 00:02:29,360
for example

71
00:02:29,360 --> 00:02:31,200
are there differences between popular or

72
00:02:31,200 --> 00:02:32,560
less popular websites

73
00:02:32,560 --> 00:02:36,000
or different website categories

74
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:37,760
employed a methodology which can be

75
00:02:37,760 --> 00:02:39,360
summarized as follows

76
00:02:39,360 --> 00:02:41,280
first we created a taxonomy of

77
00:02:41,280 --> 00:02:43,200
potentially intrusive practices

78
00:02:43,200 --> 00:02:45,599
using both technical definitions for

79
00:02:45,599 --> 00:02:46,800
internal use

80
00:02:46,800 --> 00:02:48,160
in order to remain technically

81
00:02:48,160 --> 00:02:50,959
consistent and also with non-technical

82
00:02:50,959 --> 00:02:52,879
definitions that we used in our survey

83
00:02:52,879 --> 00:02:53,519
instruments

84
00:02:53,519 --> 00:02:56,160
that would be suitable for laypersons

85
00:02:56,160 --> 00:02:57,840
without them having to understand

86
00:02:57,840 --> 00:03:00,239
all the details these also included

87
00:03:00,239 --> 00:03:02,400
descriptions of risks and benefits

88
00:03:02,400 --> 00:03:05,519
all with neutral language these

89
00:03:05,519 --> 00:03:07,760
descriptions also underwent further

90
00:03:07,760 --> 00:03:08,800
analysis

91
00:03:08,800 --> 00:03:11,200
by focus groups and were also tested in

92
00:03:11,200 --> 00:03:12,640
pilot studies

93
00:03:12,640 --> 00:03:14,480
we used these definitions to create a

94
00:03:14,480 --> 00:03:15,840
qualitative survey

95
00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:18,159
where we collected information about

96
00:03:18,159 --> 00:03:20,319
where users had encountered them

97
00:03:20,319 --> 00:03:22,239
what they'd done about them and how they

98
00:03:22,239 --> 00:03:24,239
recognized the different practices

99
00:03:24,239 --> 00:03:25,920
and these results underwent grounded

100
00:03:25,920 --> 00:03:27,920
analysis which then informed the

101
00:03:27,920 --> 00:03:30,000
creation of a large-scale quantitative

102
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:30,720
survey

103
00:03:30,720 --> 00:03:32,879
where we collected people's preferences

104
00:03:32,879 --> 00:03:34,959
to opt out of these different practices

105
00:03:34,959 --> 00:03:37,120
among different contexts this

106
00:03:37,120 --> 00:03:39,120
large-scale corpus of preferences

107
00:03:39,120 --> 00:03:41,360
was then used to evaluate alternative

108
00:03:41,360 --> 00:03:43,519
settings which could hopefully offer

109
00:03:43,519 --> 00:03:46,000
better results in terms of more accurate

110
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:46,720
settings

111
00:03:46,720 --> 00:03:48,720
with less user burden associated with

112
00:03:48,720 --> 00:03:50,480
them than what are currently offered

113
00:03:50,480 --> 00:03:51,920
across different websites

114
00:03:51,920 --> 00:03:54,879
and different browsers

115
00:03:55,360 --> 00:03:57,120
the taxonomy of potentially intrusive

116
00:03:57,120 --> 00:03:58,799
practices included the following

117
00:03:58,799 --> 00:04:00,239
practices seen here

118
00:04:00,239 --> 00:04:02,480
ranging from identity sign and services

119
00:04:02,480 --> 00:04:04,720
such as sign in with google and so on

120
00:04:04,720 --> 00:04:06,799
all the way down to targeted advertising

121
00:04:06,799 --> 00:04:08,000
behavioral profiling

122
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:10,239
reporting and analytics fingerprinting

123
00:04:10,239 --> 00:04:11,120
nag screens

124
00:04:11,120 --> 00:04:15,120
session replay and crypto mining

125
00:04:15,120 --> 00:04:17,358
and for each of these practices we ask

126
00:04:17,358 --> 00:04:18,880
questions about them in different

127
00:04:18,880 --> 00:04:19,918
contexts

128
00:04:19,918 --> 00:04:21,759
different website categories such as

129
00:04:21,759 --> 00:04:23,199
news entertainment

130
00:04:23,199 --> 00:04:26,400
shopping travel finance adult health and

131
00:04:26,400 --> 00:04:27,520
social media

132
00:04:27,520 --> 00:04:29,680
and for each of these website categories

133
00:04:29,680 --> 00:04:30,960
we showed examples of

134
00:04:30,960 --> 00:04:33,600
popular websites as well as unpopular

135
00:04:33,600 --> 00:04:34,320
websites

136
00:04:34,320 --> 00:04:35,600
across each of these different

137
00:04:35,600 --> 00:04:38,320
categories

138
00:04:40,080 --> 00:04:41,360
however there was some important

139
00:04:41,360 --> 00:04:43,280
methodological considerations when we

140
00:04:43,280 --> 00:04:44,880
went about doing this study

141
00:04:44,880 --> 00:04:46,880
as mentioned earlier it was crucially

142
00:04:46,880 --> 00:04:48,960
important that we mitigated bias as much

143
00:04:48,960 --> 00:04:49,840
as possible

144
00:04:49,840 --> 00:04:52,160
by using neutral language we didn't want

145
00:04:52,160 --> 00:04:54,479
to impart our own bias as researchers

146
00:04:54,479 --> 00:04:57,280
we also found that amongst ourselves we

147
00:04:57,280 --> 00:04:58,880
often felt quite negatively towards

148
00:04:58,880 --> 00:04:59,919
these practices

149
00:04:59,919 --> 00:05:01,520
and it was really important that we

150
00:05:01,520 --> 00:05:03,360
didn't prime our participants

151
00:05:03,360 --> 00:05:04,560
accordingly

152
00:05:04,560 --> 00:05:06,639
however there were instances where we

153
00:05:06,639 --> 00:05:07,919
did want to prime

154
00:05:07,919 --> 00:05:10,880
the participants on purpose for example

155
00:05:10,880 --> 00:05:12,240
we wanted to make sure that they

156
00:05:12,240 --> 00:05:14,080
understood what the different websites

157
00:05:14,080 --> 00:05:14,560
were

158
00:05:14,560 --> 00:05:16,800
among the different categories therefore

159
00:05:16,800 --> 00:05:18,720
we provided them with screenshots as

160
00:05:18,720 --> 00:05:20,160
well as other information about the

161
00:05:20,160 --> 00:05:20,880
websites

162
00:05:20,880 --> 00:05:22,639
such as where they were based when they

163
00:05:22,639 --> 00:05:24,560
were created and so on

164
00:05:24,560 --> 00:05:26,240
and we also wanted to prime them about

165
00:05:26,240 --> 00:05:27,919
the different categories of practices to

166
00:05:27,919 --> 00:05:29,360
make sure that it was clear

167
00:05:29,360 --> 00:05:30,800
based on the definitions that we'd

168
00:05:30,800 --> 00:05:32,639
created for them earlier

169
00:05:32,639 --> 00:05:34,560
finally we employed randomization

170
00:05:34,560 --> 00:05:35,680
wherever possible

171
00:05:35,680 --> 00:05:37,759
in order to mitigate learning effects

172
00:05:37,759 --> 00:05:39,919
such as among the ordering of different

173
00:05:39,919 --> 00:05:41,360
website categories

174
00:05:41,360 --> 00:05:43,520
and showing popular versus unpopular

175
00:05:43,520 --> 00:05:47,039
websites in particular order

176
00:05:49,280 --> 00:05:51,680
so what did we find well here's a brief

177
00:05:51,680 --> 00:05:53,600
summary of the results from our grounded

178
00:05:53,600 --> 00:05:55,840
analysis which we organized into the key

179
00:05:55,840 --> 00:05:57,600
themes you can see here

180
00:05:57,600 --> 00:05:59,360
but the ones that i'll focus on for this

181
00:05:59,360 --> 00:06:00,960
presentation are demonstrating

182
00:06:00,960 --> 00:06:01,759
understanding

183
00:06:01,759 --> 00:06:05,199
and misinterpreted signals

184
00:06:05,440 --> 00:06:06,800
when it comes to demonstrating

185
00:06:06,800 --> 00:06:08,800
understanding what we found was that a

186
00:06:08,800 --> 00:06:10,319
majority of our participants

187
00:06:10,319 --> 00:06:13,199
74 were able to demonstrate a clear

188
00:06:13,199 --> 00:06:14,960
understanding of the potential risks and

189
00:06:14,960 --> 00:06:16,880
benefits of the practices that we showed

190
00:06:16,880 --> 00:06:17,360
them

191
00:06:17,360 --> 00:06:19,759
based on their descriptions however we

192
00:06:19,759 --> 00:06:20,560
also found

193
00:06:20,560 --> 00:06:22,639
that our participants mentioned benefits

194
00:06:22,639 --> 00:06:23,600
of practices

195
00:06:23,600 --> 00:06:25,680
without us having prompted them even

196
00:06:25,680 --> 00:06:27,600
though we later provided them with both

197
00:06:27,600 --> 00:06:28,800
examples of risks

198
00:06:28,800 --> 00:06:31,360
and benefits so for instance when it

199
00:06:31,360 --> 00:06:32,639
came to nag screens

200
00:06:32,639 --> 00:06:34,400
our participants mentioned that nag

201
00:06:34,400 --> 00:06:36,080
screens could draw their attention

202
00:06:36,080 --> 00:06:38,319
to important items of interest even if

203
00:06:38,319 --> 00:06:40,560
they did find the nag screens annoying

204
00:06:40,560 --> 00:06:42,160
when it came to fingerprinting

205
00:06:42,160 --> 00:06:44,000
participants mentioned that

206
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:45,759
it could be used to potentially secure

207
00:06:45,759 --> 00:06:47,520
their accounts which they saw as

208
00:06:47,520 --> 00:06:48,080
important

209
00:06:48,080 --> 00:06:50,080
especially on financial websites for

210
00:06:50,080 --> 00:06:52,479
example

211
00:06:52,880 --> 00:06:54,960
we also saw evidence of misinterpreted

212
00:06:54,960 --> 00:06:57,680
signals such as in the following quote

213
00:06:57,680 --> 00:06:59,680
well with the ad blocker script blocker

214
00:06:59,680 --> 00:07:02,240
program i know i successfully opted out

215
00:07:02,240 --> 00:07:04,479
because i don't receive any ads at all

216
00:07:04,479 --> 00:07:06,240
and with the script blocker i'm pretty

217
00:07:06,240 --> 00:07:07,919
sure the website isn't receiving any

218
00:07:07,919 --> 00:07:10,000
information from me based off my limited

219
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:11,440
knowledge of the program

220
00:07:11,440 --> 00:07:14,000
same goes for private browsing i guess

221
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:16,080
so is this participant suggesting

222
00:07:16,080 --> 00:07:18,720
that no ads on the website means that

223
00:07:18,720 --> 00:07:20,479
there aren't any intrusive practices to

224
00:07:20,479 --> 00:07:21,599
worry about

225
00:07:21,599 --> 00:07:23,599
we saw evidence of a similar pattern

226
00:07:23,599 --> 00:07:24,639
such as this one

227
00:07:24,639 --> 00:07:28,639
in many of our participants responses

228
00:07:29,440 --> 00:07:31,280
we also saw evidence that most people

229
00:07:31,280 --> 00:07:33,520
want to deny intrusive practices most of

230
00:07:33,520 --> 00:07:34,240
the time

231
00:07:34,240 --> 00:07:36,000
which is clearly seen in this table

232
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:37,919
summarizing those results

233
00:07:37,919 --> 00:07:40,080
also you can note that fingerprinting

234
00:07:40,080 --> 00:07:42,000
has a slightly lower level of preference

235
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:43,280
to deny overall

236
00:07:43,280 --> 00:07:45,440
which is likely explained by the focus

237
00:07:45,440 --> 00:07:46,800
on benefits that we saw

238
00:07:46,800 --> 00:07:49,840
as mentioned earlier

239
00:07:52,319 --> 00:07:53,759
but what if the settings work

240
00:07:53,759 --> 00:07:56,160
differently what would that be like

241
00:07:56,160 --> 00:07:58,240
in this study we also wanted to explore

242
00:07:58,240 --> 00:08:00,080
based on the corpus of preferences

243
00:08:00,080 --> 00:08:01,840
whether we might be able to improve upon

244
00:08:01,840 --> 00:08:03,280
the settings that are offered in a

245
00:08:03,280 --> 00:08:04,000
patchwork

246
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:07,840
between websites and browsers

247
00:08:08,479 --> 00:08:09,919
however when evaluating these

248
00:08:09,919 --> 00:08:11,599
alternative settings it was really

249
00:08:11,599 --> 00:08:13,280
important to focus on the two key

250
00:08:13,280 --> 00:08:14,080
measurements

251
00:08:14,080 --> 00:08:15,599
of whether these alternative settings

252
00:08:15,599 --> 00:08:17,520
were better the first measurement

253
00:08:17,520 --> 00:08:20,160
is accuracy meaning in what percentage

254
00:08:20,160 --> 00:08:22,000
of scenarios do the settings enable

255
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:22,560
users

256
00:08:22,560 --> 00:08:24,240
to align the practices that they're

257
00:08:24,240 --> 00:08:26,639
subjected to with their preferences

258
00:08:26,639 --> 00:08:28,960
after all not all models of alternative

259
00:08:28,960 --> 00:08:30,960
settings would enable users to get the

260
00:08:30,960 --> 00:08:32,719
granular settings that they were looking

261
00:08:32,719 --> 00:08:33,839
for

262
00:08:33,839 --> 00:08:37,440
also we evaluated user burden meaning

263
00:08:37,440 --> 00:08:39,279
how many individual settings need to be

264
00:08:39,279 --> 00:08:41,200
changed for the user to get the settings

265
00:08:41,200 --> 00:08:42,880
that they actually wanted

266
00:08:42,880 --> 00:08:45,200
and we'll note that the maximum

267
00:08:45,200 --> 00:08:46,880
measurement of user burden

268
00:08:46,880 --> 00:08:48,880
was determined by the number of websites

269
00:08:48,880 --> 00:08:51,200
we surveyed since we surveyed 16

270
00:08:51,200 --> 00:08:53,680
websites across 8 different categories

271
00:08:53,680 --> 00:08:56,000
16 would be the maximum value of user

272
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:58,399
burden

273
00:08:58,560 --> 00:09:00,480
and what we found in terms of accuracy

274
00:09:00,480 --> 00:09:01,920
it looks like this

275
00:09:01,920 --> 00:09:04,560
when we start with the first no toggle

276
00:09:04,560 --> 00:09:05,760
allow model

277
00:09:05,760 --> 00:09:07,519
we're referring to essentially what's

278
00:09:07,519 --> 00:09:08,959
offered by chrome

279
00:09:08,959 --> 00:09:10,959
where all of the different practices are

280
00:09:10,959 --> 00:09:12,880
allowed and there aren't any settings

281
00:09:12,880 --> 00:09:13,440
available

282
00:09:13,440 --> 00:09:16,959
to deny them next when we look at no

283
00:09:16,959 --> 00:09:18,320
toggle deny

284
00:09:18,320 --> 00:09:20,800
this is what is most similar to strict

285
00:09:20,800 --> 00:09:22,399
mode in most browsers

286
00:09:22,399 --> 00:09:24,480
where all the settings are denied with

287
00:09:24,480 --> 00:09:26,399
no further settings offered

288
00:09:26,399 --> 00:09:28,399
you can see here that the accuracy

289
00:09:28,399 --> 00:09:30,080
substantially increases

290
00:09:30,080 --> 00:09:32,399
between the no toggle allow and the no

291
00:09:32,399 --> 00:09:33,600
toggle deny

292
00:09:33,600 --> 00:09:35,279
and this is easily explained by the

293
00:09:35,279 --> 00:09:37,600
proportion of participants that we saw

294
00:09:37,600 --> 00:09:40,080
preferring to opt out in general but

295
00:09:40,080 --> 00:09:41,839
when we look at the other two models

296
00:09:41,839 --> 00:09:44,080
category toggles and website toggles

297
00:09:44,080 --> 00:09:45,920
this allowed us to answer two different

298
00:09:45,920 --> 00:09:47,279
sets of questions

299
00:09:47,279 --> 00:09:49,360
with category toggles we're answering

300
00:09:49,360 --> 00:09:51,440
the question of what if browsers offered

301
00:09:51,440 --> 00:09:52,800
comprehensive settings

302
00:09:52,800 --> 00:09:55,040
that were based on website categories

303
00:09:55,040 --> 00:09:55,920
and you can see

304
00:09:55,920 --> 00:09:57,839
that this results in a substantially

305
00:09:57,839 --> 00:09:59,920
higher accuracy

306
00:09:59,920 --> 00:10:02,320
then when we look at individual website

307
00:10:02,320 --> 00:10:03,040
toggles

308
00:10:03,040 --> 00:10:05,279
that's answering the question of what if

309
00:10:05,279 --> 00:10:07,120
every website offered comprehensive

310
00:10:07,120 --> 00:10:07,839
settings

311
00:10:07,839 --> 00:10:10,800
allowing participants to allow or deny

312
00:10:10,800 --> 00:10:12,640
each of these data practices

313
00:10:12,640 --> 00:10:14,880
across every individual website which is

314
00:10:14,880 --> 00:10:16,399
not currently offered

315
00:10:16,399 --> 00:10:19,200
of course this would allow 100 accuracy

316
00:10:19,200 --> 00:10:21,360
since in every scenario there's a choice

317
00:10:21,360 --> 00:10:22,240
available

318
00:10:22,240 --> 00:10:24,320
for the user to change the setting to

319
00:10:24,320 --> 00:10:25,600
what they want

320
00:10:25,600 --> 00:10:28,560
but measuring only the accuracy gives

321
00:10:28,560 --> 00:10:30,240
only half of the picture

322
00:10:30,240 --> 00:10:33,519
and so you the burden is also important

323
00:10:33,519 --> 00:10:35,600
to evaluate these alternative settings

324
00:10:35,600 --> 00:10:37,680
because these different models offer

325
00:10:37,680 --> 00:10:39,920
wildly different amounts of burden

326
00:10:39,920 --> 00:10:41,839
you can see that the no toggle allow

327
00:10:41,839 --> 00:10:44,160
default is actually what we're currently

328
00:10:44,160 --> 00:10:45,600
considering to be the default and

329
00:10:45,600 --> 00:10:46,079
therefore

330
00:10:46,079 --> 00:10:48,640
has no user burden associated with it

331
00:10:48,640 --> 00:10:50,720
and it only takes one setting change to

332
00:10:50,720 --> 00:10:51,120
move

333
00:10:51,120 --> 00:10:54,800
from this setting to no toggle deny

334
00:10:54,800 --> 00:10:56,399
but when we also take a look at the

335
00:10:56,399 --> 00:10:57,839
different default settings

336
00:10:57,839 --> 00:11:00,000
among category toggles and website

337
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:02,160
toggles we noticed a pattern

338
00:11:02,160 --> 00:11:04,000
where the allow by default settings were

339
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:06,640
substantially more burdensome

340
00:11:06,640 --> 00:11:08,800
and then of course on the flip side that

341
00:11:08,800 --> 00:11:10,880
did not deny by default settings

342
00:11:10,880 --> 00:11:13,360
were substantially less burdensome so

343
00:11:13,360 --> 00:11:15,519
when we consider the trade-off between

344
00:11:15,519 --> 00:11:17,200
the amount of user burden associated

345
00:11:17,200 --> 00:11:19,279
with configuring these different models

346
00:11:19,279 --> 00:11:21,040
and then reconcile that with the level

347
00:11:21,040 --> 00:11:22,560
of accuracy that we get

348
00:11:22,560 --> 00:11:23,600
we can see that there's some

349
00:11:23,600 --> 00:11:26,160
improvements to be made the no toggle

350
00:11:26,160 --> 00:11:27,600
deny settings overall

351
00:11:27,600 --> 00:11:30,480
give a good improvement in accuracy but

352
00:11:30,480 --> 00:11:32,640
still only about 75

353
00:11:32,640 --> 00:11:34,800
overall so this is a reasonable

354
00:11:34,800 --> 00:11:36,720
trade-off especially considering that

355
00:11:36,720 --> 00:11:39,360
there's a very low level of user burden

356
00:11:39,360 --> 00:11:41,120
but we certainly can do much better than

357
00:11:41,120 --> 00:11:43,760
that after all the category toggles

358
00:11:43,760 --> 00:11:46,720
with deny by default offered roughly 92

359
00:11:46,720 --> 00:11:47,279
percent

360
00:11:47,279 --> 00:11:50,399
average accuracy and yet also have a

361
00:11:50,399 --> 00:11:52,480
very low level of user burden associated

362
00:11:52,480 --> 00:11:53,360
with them

363
00:11:53,360 --> 00:11:54,959
so we recognize that this might

364
00:11:54,959 --> 00:11:59,279
potentially be an optimal trade-off

365
00:12:00,880 --> 00:12:02,560
so the key takeaways from this

366
00:12:02,560 --> 00:12:04,079
particular part of our study were as

367
00:12:04,079 --> 00:12:04,959
follows

368
00:12:04,959 --> 00:12:07,200
deny by default settings are much closer

369
00:12:07,200 --> 00:12:08,480
to what people want

370
00:12:08,480 --> 00:12:10,320
and we could clearly see this earlier

371
00:12:10,320 --> 00:12:12,880
when people express their preferences to

372
00:12:12,880 --> 00:12:14,720
opt out

373
00:12:14,720 --> 00:12:16,880
but we also see here that deny by

374
00:12:16,880 --> 00:12:17,760
default is

375
00:12:17,760 --> 00:12:20,160
less burdensome people need to make less

376
00:12:20,160 --> 00:12:21,839
decisions and need to change less

377
00:12:21,839 --> 00:12:22,560
settings

378
00:12:22,560 --> 00:12:25,839
when we have deny by default settings

379
00:12:25,839 --> 00:12:28,160
we also see however that individual

380
00:12:28,160 --> 00:12:29,200
website settings

381
00:12:29,200 --> 00:12:31,600
are simply too burdensome if we offered

382
00:12:31,600 --> 00:12:33,440
settings across every single website

383
00:12:33,440 --> 00:12:35,360
which is not currently offered

384
00:12:35,360 --> 00:12:37,120
it's still better than the situation

385
00:12:37,120 --> 00:12:38,639
where people don't have any choice at

386
00:12:38,639 --> 00:12:39,200
all

387
00:12:39,200 --> 00:12:40,880
but we're simply offering them far too

388
00:12:40,880 --> 00:12:42,639
many choices particularly

389
00:12:42,639 --> 00:12:46,000
if we're doing allow by default settings

390
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:48,079
therefore standard settings which are

391
00:12:48,079 --> 00:12:49,920
based on website categories

392
00:12:49,920 --> 00:12:52,240
would likely be much easier to configure

393
00:12:52,240 --> 00:12:53,360
but would still retain

394
00:12:53,360 --> 00:12:56,720
very high accuracy

395
00:12:58,320 --> 00:13:00,240
but there's still a problem and that

396
00:13:00,240 --> 00:13:01,920
problem is website breakage and

397
00:13:01,920 --> 00:13:03,600
misaligned incentives

398
00:13:03,600 --> 00:13:05,920
you see as i mentioned earlier websites

399
00:13:05,920 --> 00:13:07,519
only offer a patchwork of different

400
00:13:07,519 --> 00:13:08,320
options

401
00:13:08,320 --> 00:13:10,000
and so if we were to ensure that

402
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:12,079
websites each offered comprehensive

403
00:13:12,079 --> 00:13:12,720
options

404
00:13:12,720 --> 00:13:14,160
for controlling all the different

405
00:13:14,160 --> 00:13:16,240
practices we described in our study

406
00:13:16,240 --> 00:13:18,079
it would create a large amount of

407
00:13:18,079 --> 00:13:19,680
additional burden

408
00:13:19,680 --> 00:13:21,519
but a single place to configure these

409
00:13:21,519 --> 00:13:23,839
preferences would be far more ideal

410
00:13:23,839 --> 00:13:25,279
rather than forcing people to

411
00:13:25,279 --> 00:13:26,880
reconfigure these preferences on

412
00:13:26,880 --> 00:13:28,720
individual websites as they browse the

413
00:13:28,720 --> 00:13:29,680
web

414
00:13:29,680 --> 00:13:31,680
so let's make the settings standard if

415
00:13:31,680 --> 00:13:33,200
they're configured the same way

416
00:13:33,200 --> 00:13:34,800
and applied everywhere it would

417
00:13:34,800 --> 00:13:38,000
certainly be a big improvement for users

418
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:41,199
but would it unfortunately it's just not

419
00:13:41,199 --> 00:13:42,800
that simple

420
00:13:42,800 --> 00:13:44,880
standards such as do not track and other

421
00:13:44,880 --> 00:13:47,120
similar voluntary standards have failed

422
00:13:47,120 --> 00:13:48,959
as they're often not respected by

423
00:13:48,959 --> 00:13:50,880
different individual websites

424
00:13:50,880 --> 00:13:52,800
and the reason why this happens is

425
00:13:52,800 --> 00:13:54,320
because websites have different

426
00:13:54,320 --> 00:13:55,839
incentives than browsers

427
00:13:55,839 --> 00:13:58,480
or different incentives from users

428
00:13:58,480 --> 00:14:00,399
websites could potentially break

429
00:14:00,399 --> 00:14:01,839
when people try to enact their

430
00:14:01,839 --> 00:14:04,480
preferences but then blame the user

431
00:14:04,480 --> 00:14:06,000
just because they're trying to take back

432
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:08,240
control what we need then

433
00:14:08,240 --> 00:14:10,240
is standards that websites will comply

434
00:14:10,240 --> 00:14:11,920
with in order to prevent

435
00:14:11,920 --> 00:14:14,399
the situation where people get punished

436
00:14:14,399 --> 00:14:15,839
just for simply enacting their

437
00:14:15,839 --> 00:14:18,480
preferences

438
00:14:24,800 --> 00:14:27,040
so to summarize people have different

439
00:14:27,040 --> 00:14:28,480
levels of appreciation

440
00:14:28,480 --> 00:14:30,399
for the risks and benefits of different

441
00:14:30,399 --> 00:14:32,880
practices even if they don't understand

442
00:14:32,880 --> 00:14:35,360
all the different technical details and

443
00:14:35,360 --> 00:14:36,240
what we found

444
00:14:36,240 --> 00:14:38,079
was that there's relationships between

445
00:14:38,079 --> 00:14:39,760
people's op debt preferences

446
00:14:39,760 --> 00:14:41,920
the types of practices and the types of

447
00:14:41,920 --> 00:14:42,800
websites

448
00:14:42,800 --> 00:14:44,880
which suggests that one size fits all

449
00:14:44,880 --> 00:14:48,399
settings really can't satisfy everyone

450
00:14:48,399 --> 00:14:50,399
we also found that most people want to

451
00:14:50,399 --> 00:14:52,720
opt out and they assume that settings

452
00:14:52,720 --> 00:14:54,800
must exist whether it's in their browser

453
00:14:54,800 --> 00:14:56,000
or on websites

454
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:57,920
but they have a hard time finding them

455
00:14:57,920 --> 00:14:59,440
typically because they don't actually

456
00:14:59,440 --> 00:15:00,160
exist

457
00:15:00,160 --> 00:15:03,519
and this results in a lot of frustration

458
00:15:03,519 --> 00:15:05,279
people also want to be notified about

459
00:15:05,279 --> 00:15:06,959
the practices that exist on different

460
00:15:06,959 --> 00:15:07,600
sites

461
00:15:07,600 --> 00:15:09,360
but they're misled by what they see when

462
00:15:09,360 --> 00:15:11,360
they're browsing particularly when it

463
00:15:11,360 --> 00:15:13,920
comes to things like ads

464
00:15:13,920 --> 00:15:16,160
and what results is a misalignment

465
00:15:16,160 --> 00:15:18,240
between the control that people expect

466
00:15:18,240 --> 00:15:20,320
over potentially intrusive practices

467
00:15:20,320 --> 00:15:21,760
and what they're actually getting when

468
00:15:21,760 --> 00:15:23,839
they're browsing

469
00:15:23,839 --> 00:15:26,240
we believe then that standard settings

470
00:15:26,240 --> 00:15:28,000
have the potential to help

471
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:30,240
they could be both more accurate than

472
00:15:30,240 --> 00:15:32,240
one size fits all preferences

473
00:15:32,240 --> 00:15:34,720
and also be less burdensome than

474
00:15:34,720 --> 00:15:36,880
offering settings individually across

475
00:15:36,880 --> 00:15:38,160
every different website

476
00:15:38,160 --> 00:15:41,839
