00:00:01,920 --> 00:00:03,040
hello everyone

2
00:00:03,040 --> 00:00:05,680
my name is max heltz i'm a phd student

3
00:00:05,680 --> 00:00:06,960
at the university of innsbruck in

4
00:00:06,960 --> 00:00:07,759
austria

5
00:00:07,759 --> 00:00:09,760
today i present joint work with daniel

6
00:00:09,760 --> 00:00:11,759
woods who will be joining me later

7
00:00:11,759 --> 00:00:14,480
and reina burma in our paper we look at

8
00:00:14,480 --> 00:00:15,360
the past

9
00:00:15,360 --> 00:00:17,680
present and future of privacy preference

10
00:00:17,680 --> 00:00:19,359
signals

11
00:00:19,359 --> 00:00:22,000
if we go back to the 2000s some of you

12
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:23,519
may remember p3p

13
00:00:23,519 --> 00:00:26,160
the platform for privacy preferences

14
00:00:26,160 --> 00:00:26,960
arguably

15
00:00:26,960 --> 00:00:29,039
this was the first major privacy signal

16
00:00:29,039 --> 00:00:30,640
on the web delivered with a simple

17
00:00:30,640 --> 00:00:32,880
protocol between website and browser

18
00:00:32,880 --> 00:00:34,960
it was recommended by the world wide web

19
00:00:34,960 --> 00:00:36,640
consortium in 2002

20
00:00:36,640 --> 00:00:38,480
but ultimately failed due to a lack of

21
00:00:38,480 --> 00:00:40,160
adoption

22
00:00:40,160 --> 00:00:42,079
a bit more recent if you look at the

23
00:00:42,079 --> 00:00:44,000
2010s many of you will

24
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:46,719
remember do not track this standard had

25
00:00:46,719 --> 00:00:48,320
a much simpler design with a single

26
00:00:48,320 --> 00:00:50,079
switch in the browser

27
00:00:50,079 --> 00:00:52,559
unfortunately there was some controversy

28
00:00:52,559 --> 00:00:54,719
on the default setting of that switch

29
00:00:54,719 --> 00:00:56,879
as a result attack companies decided to

30
00:00:56,879 --> 00:00:58,640
withdraw from the initiative

31
00:00:58,640 --> 00:01:02,399
and this privacy signal failed as well

32
00:01:02,399 --> 00:01:04,159
today we have something many of you are

33
00:01:04,159 --> 00:01:05,519
very familiar with

34
00:01:05,519 --> 00:01:08,080
gdpr cookie proms these content

35
00:01:08,080 --> 00:01:10,479
dialogues are often based on the tcf

36
00:01:10,479 --> 00:01:13,040
the trust and content frameworks the

37
00:01:13,040 --> 00:01:14,880
dialogues claim to capture your privacy

38
00:01:14,880 --> 00:01:17,200
preferences and share constant decisions

39
00:01:17,200 --> 00:01:20,000
with third parties while the example

40
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:22,159
here may look simple on the surface

41
00:01:22,159 --> 00:01:24,080
we shall see that the underlying privacy

42
00:01:24,080 --> 00:01:27,040
signal is actually quite complex

43
00:01:27,040 --> 00:01:28,880
the fact that you see these dialogues

44
00:01:28,880 --> 00:01:30,240
everywhere on the web

45
00:01:30,240 --> 00:01:32,000
actually suggests widespread adoption

46
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:35,040
though in the paper we ask

47
00:01:35,040 --> 00:01:37,040
why is this particular signal so

48
00:01:37,040 --> 00:01:39,200
successful and what can we as the

49
00:01:39,200 --> 00:01:41,840
community learn from that

50
00:01:41,840 --> 00:01:44,079
in this presentation my co-author daniel

51
00:01:44,079 --> 00:01:45,200
woods and i

52
00:01:45,200 --> 00:01:47,520
take you on a time travel daniel will

53
00:01:47,520 --> 00:01:49,520
first look at past signals

54
00:01:49,520 --> 00:01:51,280
then i will zoom into the tcf and

55
00:01:51,280 --> 00:01:52,880
present our web measurements

56
00:01:52,880 --> 00:01:54,720
and finally daniel will take a crystal

57
00:01:54,720 --> 00:01:56,159
ball and make some predictions on the

58
00:01:56,159 --> 00:01:57,200
future

59
00:01:57,200 --> 00:01:59,680
those concern the upcoming gpc signal as

60
00:01:59,680 --> 00:02:02,399
well as more general lessons learned

61
00:02:02,399 --> 00:02:05,600
daniel now it's your turn so privacy

62
00:02:05,600 --> 00:02:06,880
preference signals

63
00:02:06,880 --> 00:02:10,160
are digital representations of how users

64
00:02:10,160 --> 00:02:13,520
want their personal data to be processed

65
00:02:13,520 --> 00:02:16,640
signals must be adapted by both senders

66
00:02:16,640 --> 00:02:19,680
and recipients in this case senders are

67
00:02:19,680 --> 00:02:20,560
users

68
00:02:20,560 --> 00:02:23,360
and recipients are ad tech fans and

69
00:02:23,360 --> 00:02:26,400
websites who process personal data

70
00:02:26,400 --> 00:02:29,280
such signals are intended to influence

71
00:02:29,280 --> 00:02:29,599
how

72
00:02:29,599 --> 00:02:31,920
entities including websites and third

73
00:02:31,920 --> 00:02:33,040
parties process

74
00:02:33,040 --> 00:02:36,080
personal data these signals vary from a

75
00:02:36,080 --> 00:02:36,720
binary

76
00:02:36,720 --> 00:02:39,200
do not track through to the more complex

77
00:02:39,200 --> 00:02:40,239
expressions

78
00:02:40,239 --> 00:02:43,519
seen in cookie consent dialogues and

79
00:02:43,519 --> 00:02:45,760
adoption represents a coordination

80
00:02:45,760 --> 00:02:46,560
problem

81
00:02:46,560 --> 00:02:49,040
because there's no sense of senders

82
00:02:49,040 --> 00:02:50,239
sending a signal

83
00:02:50,239 --> 00:02:52,640
when no recipients have adapted it and

84
00:02:52,640 --> 00:02:53,440
equally

85
00:02:53,440 --> 00:02:55,599
there's no sense in recipients adapting

86
00:02:55,599 --> 00:02:58,239
a signal that nobody sends

87
00:02:58,239 --> 00:03:00,959
so efforts to standardize a privacy

88
00:03:00,959 --> 00:03:02,879
preference signal go back to the late

89
00:03:02,879 --> 00:03:04,000
90s

90
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:06,480
ad tech vendors and privacy actors alike

91
00:03:06,480 --> 00:03:08,400
participated in the world wide web

92
00:03:08,400 --> 00:03:10,800
consortium's working group

93
00:03:10,800 --> 00:03:13,920
it provided a way for users to express

94
00:03:13,920 --> 00:03:16,400
preferences that could be compared with

95
00:03:16,400 --> 00:03:19,760
website privacy policies you may also

96
00:03:19,760 --> 00:03:21,840
remember this little green bird

97
00:03:21,840 --> 00:03:26,519
the p3p's mascot in 2002 the p3p

98
00:03:26,519 --> 00:03:29,280
specification was recommended

99
00:03:29,280 --> 00:03:32,400
from a technical perspective p3p

100
00:03:32,400 --> 00:03:36,000
describes an xml format to encode

101
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:38,720
a human readable privacy policy into a

102
00:03:38,720 --> 00:03:41,440
machine readable specification

103
00:03:41,440 --> 00:03:44,000
users can define individual privacy

104
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:45,280
preferences

105
00:03:45,280 --> 00:03:48,159
which a user agent like a browser can

106
00:03:48,159 --> 00:03:49,040
cross-check

107
00:03:49,040 --> 00:03:52,879
against a website's self-reported p3p

108
00:03:52,879 --> 00:03:56,319
policy unfortunately it was only adapted

109
00:03:56,319 --> 00:03:57,439
by one browser

110
00:03:57,439 --> 00:03:59,840
microsoft who gave websites with

111
00:03:59,840 --> 00:04:01,280
misconfigured policies

112
00:04:01,280 --> 00:04:04,400
a free pass this meant that vendors and

113
00:04:04,400 --> 00:04:06,560
websites had no incentive

114
00:04:06,560 --> 00:04:08,720
to honestly express their privacy

115
00:04:08,720 --> 00:04:11,120
policies

116
00:04:11,120 --> 00:04:13,920
five years before the p3p was eventually

117
00:04:13,920 --> 00:04:16,720
obsoleted in 2016

118
00:04:16,720 --> 00:04:18,959
the world wide web consortium again

119
00:04:18,959 --> 00:04:20,560
launched a working group

120
00:04:20,560 --> 00:04:22,720
this time to standardize the do not

121
00:04:22,720 --> 00:04:25,120
track mechanism

122
00:04:25,120 --> 00:04:27,360
from a technical perspective do not

123
00:04:27,360 --> 00:04:28,160
track was

124
00:04:28,160 --> 00:04:31,680
much simpler than p3p if a user enabled

125
00:04:31,680 --> 00:04:32,880
do not track

126
00:04:32,880 --> 00:04:35,600
their browser would send a simple do not

127
00:04:35,600 --> 00:04:36,720
track

128
00:04:36,720 --> 00:04:40,160
header equals to one with each http

129
00:04:40,160 --> 00:04:43,040
request signaling that they do not want

130
00:04:43,040 --> 00:04:44,479
to be tracked

131
00:04:44,479 --> 00:04:46,240
do not track actually received

132
00:04:46,240 --> 00:04:48,240
widespread adoption among browsers with

133
00:04:48,240 --> 00:04:50,320
even google reluctantly

134
00:04:50,320 --> 00:04:53,600
adapting it however websites and vendor

135
00:04:53,600 --> 00:04:54,320
adoption

136
00:04:54,320 --> 00:04:56,880
was negligible and the internet

137
00:04:56,880 --> 00:04:58,080
advertising bro

138
00:04:58,080 --> 00:05:00,479
famously withdrew from the working group

139
00:05:00,479 --> 00:05:02,400
after microsoft announced that the

140
00:05:02,400 --> 00:05:03,600
signal would be turned

141
00:05:03,600 --> 00:05:07,039
to on as default the world wide web

142
00:05:07,039 --> 00:05:08,639
consortium's working loop

143
00:05:08,639 --> 00:05:12,000
wasn't actually closed until 2019

144
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:14,720
in the meantime adtech had begun to work

145
00:05:14,720 --> 00:05:15,280
on an

146
00:05:15,280 --> 00:05:18,320
alternative signal welcome back to the

147
00:05:18,320 --> 00:05:19,360
present

148
00:05:19,360 --> 00:05:21,840
while do not track lack the legal basis

149
00:05:21,840 --> 00:05:23,199
that could have forced attack to

150
00:05:23,199 --> 00:05:24,240
participate

151
00:05:24,240 --> 00:05:25,680
the signal we are seeing on many

152
00:05:25,680 --> 00:05:28,000
websites today touts itself as a

153
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:28,880
standard

154
00:05:28,880 --> 00:05:31,600
built by the attic industry for the ad

155
00:05:31,600 --> 00:05:33,039
tech industry

156
00:05:33,039 --> 00:05:35,039
more precisely the interactive

157
00:05:35,039 --> 00:05:37,759
advertising bureau has developed the tcf

158
00:05:37,759 --> 00:05:40,160
as a reaction to the gdpr the general

159
00:05:40,160 --> 00:05:42,400
data protection regulation in europe

160
00:05:42,400 --> 00:05:44,560
the first version of tcf was published

161
00:05:44,560 --> 00:05:45,759
in 2018

162
00:05:45,759 --> 00:05:48,479
and since spring 2020 we are at version

163
00:05:48,479 --> 00:05:49,759
2.

164
00:05:49,759 --> 00:05:52,240
while everyone has seen these dialogues

165
00:05:52,240 --> 00:05:54,320
the underlying standard is much less

166
00:05:54,320 --> 00:05:55,360
known

167
00:05:55,360 --> 00:05:57,520
one reason for that is that tcf was

168
00:05:57,520 --> 00:06:00,160
developed by a subset of the community

169
00:06:00,160 --> 00:06:02,240
while the world wide web consortium

170
00:06:02,240 --> 00:06:04,080
followed a multi-stakeholder approach

171
00:06:04,080 --> 00:06:06,000
with p3p and dnt

172
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:08,400
the iab exerts quite some control over

173
00:06:08,400 --> 00:06:09,520
tcf

174
00:06:09,520 --> 00:06:11,120
they decide who can join the working

175
00:06:11,120 --> 00:06:13,280
group who can collect signals under the

176
00:06:13,280 --> 00:06:14,080
standard

177
00:06:14,080 --> 00:06:16,000
and also which attack vendors can

178
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:17,840
receive tcf signals

179
00:06:17,840 --> 00:06:21,280
p3p was quite complex then dnt proposed

180
00:06:21,280 --> 00:06:22,720
a much simpler approach

181
00:06:22,720 --> 00:06:25,440
and now tcf is a very complex signal

182
00:06:25,440 --> 00:06:26,400
again

183
00:06:26,400 --> 00:06:29,600
however a key difference to p3p is that

184
00:06:29,600 --> 00:06:30,720
tcf does

185
00:06:30,720 --> 00:06:33,199
not require adoption by browsers

186
00:06:33,199 --> 00:06:35,199
websites implement the content dialog

187
00:06:35,199 --> 00:06:36,080
directly

188
00:06:36,080 --> 00:06:38,080
which means that the browsers have no

189
00:06:38,080 --> 00:06:39,759
say in the design of the signal and its

190
00:06:39,759 --> 00:06:42,479
user interface

191
00:06:42,479 --> 00:06:44,560
let me come back to our claim that tcf

192
00:06:44,560 --> 00:06:46,080
is a complex signal

193
00:06:46,080 --> 00:06:48,160
i've also shown you this dialog before

194
00:06:48,160 --> 00:06:50,080
and you may be tempted to say well

195
00:06:50,080 --> 00:06:52,319
there are two buttons here this looks

196
00:06:52,319 --> 00:06:53,680
rather simple

197
00:06:53,680 --> 00:06:55,039
well there's actually much more

198
00:06:55,039 --> 00:06:56,800
complexity hiding behind this more

199
00:06:56,800 --> 00:06:58,080
options button

200
00:06:58,080 --> 00:07:00,400
below the initial surface you can find a

201
00:07:00,400 --> 00:07:02,160
list of specific data processing

202
00:07:02,160 --> 00:07:03,039
purposes

203
00:07:03,039 --> 00:07:05,360
and you can also find a list of the 600

204
00:07:05,360 --> 00:07:07,039
something vendors participating in the

205
00:07:07,039 --> 00:07:08,560
framework

206
00:07:08,560 --> 00:07:10,800
additionally the tcf standardizes

207
00:07:10,800 --> 00:07:12,479
specific legal basis

208
00:07:12,479 --> 00:07:14,560
under which vendors may process personal

209
00:07:14,560 --> 00:07:15,680
data

210
00:07:15,680 --> 00:07:18,000
let me give you an idea what that means

211
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:20,080
if you want to exercise all privacy

212
00:07:20,080 --> 00:07:21,680
options available to you

213
00:07:21,680 --> 00:07:24,400
clicking reject all is actually not

214
00:07:24,400 --> 00:07:25,280
enough

215
00:07:25,280 --> 00:07:27,199
you also need to go to the legitimate

216
00:07:27,199 --> 00:07:28,880
interest section down here

217
00:07:28,880 --> 00:07:31,199
then manually object to everything on

218
00:07:31,199 --> 00:07:32,240
the screen

219
00:07:32,240 --> 00:07:34,800
and only now you have actually opted out

220
00:07:34,800 --> 00:07:36,560
from all tracking

221
00:07:36,560 --> 00:07:38,880
that is of course a bit ridiculous but

222
00:07:38,880 --> 00:07:40,560
from a research perspective it is

223
00:07:40,560 --> 00:07:41,680
interesting to study

224
00:07:41,680 --> 00:07:44,160
how websites and vendors alike make use

225
00:07:44,160 --> 00:07:47,280
of this complex standard

226
00:07:47,840 --> 00:07:50,319
the empirical part of our paper analyzes

227
00:07:50,319 --> 00:07:52,160
the adoption of tcf with a novel

228
00:07:52,160 --> 00:07:54,000
combination of data sources

229
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:55,599
since we described our measurement

230
00:07:55,599 --> 00:07:57,360
methodology in a separate paper

231
00:07:57,360 --> 00:07:59,199
published at the 2020 internet

232
00:07:59,199 --> 00:08:01,039
measurement conference we only want to

233
00:08:01,039 --> 00:08:02,639
give you a rough idea of our data sets

234
00:08:02,639 --> 00:08:03,599
here

235
00:08:03,599 --> 00:08:06,080
first we use natograph to obtain about

236
00:08:06,080 --> 00:08:07,759
seven million captures of websites

237
00:08:07,759 --> 00:08:09,280
embedding constant dialogues that

238
00:08:09,280 --> 00:08:10,879
implement the tcf

239
00:08:10,879 --> 00:08:13,039
this data is longitudinal and goes back

240
00:08:13,039 --> 00:08:14,800
to early 2018

241
00:08:14,800 --> 00:08:16,960
it allows us to observe at which point

242
00:08:16,960 --> 00:08:20,560
in time which website adopted tcf

243
00:08:20,560 --> 00:08:22,560
the second data source is a snapshot

244
00:08:22,560 --> 00:08:25,120
crawl of the top 100 000 websites in the

245
00:08:25,120 --> 00:08:26,160
tranquil top list

246
00:08:26,160 --> 00:08:29,520
as of february 2021 for this measurement

247
00:08:29,520 --> 00:08:30,000
we use

248
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:32,159
customized browser instrumentation to

249
00:08:32,159 --> 00:08:33,839
directly interact with the tcf

250
00:08:33,839 --> 00:08:35,919
javascript apis

251
00:08:35,919 --> 00:08:38,479
and finally third we also use the

252
00:08:38,479 --> 00:08:41,279
historic versions of the tcf vendor list

253
00:08:41,279 --> 00:08:42,958
all attack vendors who want to receive

254
00:08:42,958 --> 00:08:45,360
the tcf signal need to register on this

255
00:08:45,360 --> 00:08:45,839
list

256
00:08:45,839 --> 00:08:49,120
and pay a fee to the iab

257
00:08:49,120 --> 00:08:51,200
now coming to our results i would like

258
00:08:51,200 --> 00:08:52,959
to leave the logistic regressions in the

259
00:08:52,959 --> 00:08:53,519
paper

260
00:08:53,519 --> 00:08:55,120
and show you some high level results

261
00:08:55,120 --> 00:08:57,839
here in this figure we see the adoption

262
00:08:57,839 --> 00:09:00,480
of tcf by ad tech vendors over time

263
00:09:00,480 --> 00:09:02,880
on the left we see the adoption of tcf

264
00:09:02,880 --> 00:09:04,640
version 1 and 2018

265
00:09:04,640 --> 00:09:06,720
and then the steady switch to version 2

266
00:09:06,720 --> 00:09:08,720
throughout 2020 in green

267
00:09:08,720 --> 00:09:10,640
or preserve in yellow that some new

268
00:09:10,640 --> 00:09:14,240
vendors join version 2 directly

269
00:09:14,240 --> 00:09:16,000
i would like you to pay attention to two

270
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:17,680
things in particular here

271
00:09:17,680 --> 00:09:19,920
first we can see a massive adoption of

272
00:09:19,920 --> 00:09:21,680
the signal right after it was announced

273
00:09:21,680 --> 00:09:22,560
in april

274
00:09:22,560 --> 00:09:25,600
2018 which was shortly before the gdpr

275
00:09:25,600 --> 00:09:27,200
came into effect

276
00:09:27,200 --> 00:09:30,240
second if you look at around august 2020

277
00:09:30,240 --> 00:09:32,399
we see that the vast majority of vendors

278
00:09:32,399 --> 00:09:34,800
had switched at this point

279
00:09:34,800 --> 00:09:36,480
these two points in time are very

280
00:09:36,480 --> 00:09:38,080
interesting to contrast against

281
00:09:38,080 --> 00:09:40,080
website's adoption behavior

282
00:09:40,080 --> 00:09:42,320
let me keep the red frames here and

283
00:09:42,320 --> 00:09:45,120
replace the time series behind

284
00:09:45,120 --> 00:09:47,760
now we see a different picture first the

285
00:09:47,760 --> 00:09:50,480
ramp up in 2018 is much slower

286
00:09:50,480 --> 00:09:53,120
when gdpr came into effect almost no

287
00:09:53,120 --> 00:09:55,760
websites were using the tcf signal yet

288
00:09:55,760 --> 00:09:58,560
likewise if we look at august 2020 we

289
00:09:58,560 --> 00:09:59,519
see that only

290
00:09:59,519 --> 00:10:01,120
half of our websites had switched at

291
00:10:01,120 --> 00:10:03,760
this point our reading of this is that

292
00:10:03,760 --> 00:10:04,800
ad tech vendors

293
00:10:04,800 --> 00:10:06,880
had been driving the adoption both for

294
00:10:06,880 --> 00:10:07,839
the initial version

295
00:10:07,839 --> 00:10:10,240
and the switch to version 2. while two

296
00:10:10,240 --> 00:10:11,200
instances provide

297
00:10:11,200 --> 00:10:13,200
some confidence we can support this

298
00:10:13,200 --> 00:10:16,640
conclusion with micro level evidence

299
00:10:16,640 --> 00:10:18,800
for this we analyze the factors that

300
00:10:18,800 --> 00:10:21,120
lead websites to adopt tcf

301
00:10:21,120 --> 00:10:23,600
for example websites that embed more

302
00:10:23,600 --> 00:10:24,640
third parties

303
00:10:24,640 --> 00:10:27,360
are more likely to adopt tcf this

304
00:10:27,360 --> 00:10:29,279
supports the argument that a standard

305
00:10:29,279 --> 00:10:31,760
helps to coordinate many parties

306
00:10:31,760 --> 00:10:34,000
an additional driver could be website's

307
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:36,640
reliance on advertising revenue

308
00:10:36,640 --> 00:10:38,959
to test this we select one specific

309
00:10:38,959 --> 00:10:40,000
third party

310
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:42,160
namely google ads what's interesting

311
00:10:42,160 --> 00:10:43,279
about google is

312
00:10:43,279 --> 00:10:45,279
that it did not adopt the first version

313
00:10:45,279 --> 00:10:49,120
of tcf but joined at version 2 in 2020

314
00:10:49,120 --> 00:10:52,320
now of all websites which now support

315
00:10:52,320 --> 00:10:53,600
tcf2

316
00:10:53,600 --> 00:10:56,959
and not use google ads 60

317
00:10:56,959 --> 00:11:00,079
had already joined tcf version 1 whereas

318
00:11:00,079 --> 00:11:02,160
this applies only to 45

319
00:11:02,160 --> 00:11:04,959
of the websites using google ads one

320
00:11:04,959 --> 00:11:06,959
plausible interpretation to me is that

321
00:11:06,959 --> 00:11:09,680
the website's boost of tcf adoption is

322
00:11:09,680 --> 00:11:12,839
directly related to google's adoption of

323
00:11:12,839 --> 00:11:14,480
tcf

324
00:11:14,480 --> 00:11:16,240
let me summarize the picture our data

325
00:11:16,240 --> 00:11:18,480
paints today our measurements show that

326
00:11:18,480 --> 00:11:20,160
tcf has been adopted by

327
00:11:20,160 --> 00:11:21,680
hundreds of ad tech vendors and

328
00:11:21,680 --> 00:11:23,760
thousands of websites meanwhile

329
00:11:23,760 --> 00:11:27,279
p3p and dnt are history so

330
00:11:27,279 --> 00:11:30,399
is tcf going to rule the web

331
00:11:30,399 --> 00:11:32,959
not quite there are alternative signals

332
00:11:32,959 --> 00:11:34,160
on the horizon

333
00:11:34,160 --> 00:11:36,240
turning to the future i will hand over

334
00:11:36,240 --> 00:11:37,920
to daniel

335
00:11:37,920 --> 00:11:40,720
the global privacy control was defined

336
00:11:40,720 --> 00:11:41,200
in an

337
00:11:41,200 --> 00:11:43,760
unofficial draft specification in

338
00:11:43,760 --> 00:11:46,079
october 2020

339
00:11:46,079 --> 00:11:48,000
it continues the approach of do not

340
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:49,120
track and that it

341
00:11:49,120 --> 00:11:52,079
extends http request with a single bit

342
00:11:52,079 --> 00:11:53,120
value

343
00:11:53,120 --> 00:11:55,279
but most importantly the signals

344
00:11:55,279 --> 00:11:56,480
specification

345
00:11:56,480 --> 00:11:59,519
now directly references the do not sell

346
00:11:59,519 --> 00:12:00,399
clause

347
00:12:00,399 --> 00:12:04,399
from the california consumer privacy act

348
00:12:04,399 --> 00:12:06,399
now rather than collect preferences by

349
00:12:06,399 --> 00:12:08,839
embedding dialogues in web pages like

350
00:12:08,839 --> 00:12:12,000
tcf under the global privacy control

351
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:14,000
privacy preferences are collected via

352
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:16,240
user agents like for instance browsers

353
00:12:16,240 --> 00:12:18,000
or browser add-ons

354
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:20,240
thus user adoption decisions are in

355
00:12:20,240 --> 00:12:22,240
effect made by browsers

356
00:12:22,240 --> 00:12:24,639
this means that gpc adaption will be

357
00:12:24,639 --> 00:12:26,000
adapted in leaps

358
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:28,639
as each browser had support rather than

359
00:12:28,639 --> 00:12:30,000
in this kind of slow

360
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:32,000
trickle which we just saw in which

361
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:33,760
thousands of websites adapted the

362
00:12:33,760 --> 00:12:35,440
transparency and convince

363
00:12:35,440 --> 00:12:38,880
consent framework so for example the gpc

364
00:12:38,880 --> 00:12:40,480
website now reports that

365
00:12:40,480 --> 00:12:42,880
over 40 million users are currently

366
00:12:42,880 --> 00:12:44,160
utilizing a browser

367
00:12:44,160 --> 00:12:47,519
or browser extension with gpc support

368
00:12:47,519 --> 00:12:49,839
now interestingly the specification

369
00:12:49,839 --> 00:12:51,200
creates the possibility

370
00:12:51,200 --> 00:12:53,680
for websites and ad tech vendors to

371
00:12:53,680 --> 00:12:55,920
publicly advertise that they support the

372
00:12:55,920 --> 00:12:56,880
signal

373
00:12:56,880 --> 00:12:59,360
this makes a web scraping adoption study

374
00:12:59,360 --> 00:13:02,079
possible for future work

375
00:13:02,079 --> 00:13:05,360
so privacy preference signals

376
00:13:05,360 --> 00:13:08,320
like for instance p3p or global privacy

377
00:13:08,320 --> 00:13:08,880
control

378
00:13:08,880 --> 00:13:11,200
are collected once via a user agent and

379
00:13:11,200 --> 00:13:14,399
they apply across the entire web

380
00:13:14,399 --> 00:13:17,600
in contrast tcf signals apply to just

381
00:13:17,600 --> 00:13:18,959
one website or at least they're

382
00:13:18,959 --> 00:13:20,079
collected by a single

383
00:13:20,079 --> 00:13:22,720
website and they expire after a period

384
00:13:22,720 --> 00:13:24,320
of time

385
00:13:24,320 --> 00:13:26,959
and a cost is actually paid for this

386
00:13:26,959 --> 00:13:28,639
because

387
00:13:28,639 --> 00:13:30,800
websites must show this dialogue and

388
00:13:30,800 --> 00:13:32,160
that takes attention

389
00:13:32,160 --> 00:13:34,959
away from content which users enjoy and

390
00:13:34,959 --> 00:13:35,760
it

391
00:13:35,760 --> 00:13:37,680
takes time away from adverts which

392
00:13:37,680 --> 00:13:39,199
generate revenue

393
00:13:39,199 --> 00:13:42,079
we actually estimate in the paper that 2

394
00:13:42,079 --> 00:13:43,040
500 years

395
00:13:43,040 --> 00:13:45,600
of user time was spent sending tcf

396
00:13:45,600 --> 00:13:46,560
signals

397
00:13:46,560 --> 00:13:49,680
so this is a huge opportunity cast and

398
00:13:49,680 --> 00:13:51,360
why is it accepted

399
00:13:51,360 --> 00:13:53,360
it's because ad tech vendors want to

400
00:13:53,360 --> 00:13:55,519
claim that user consent

401
00:13:55,519 --> 00:13:58,639
was real and autonomously collected and

402
00:13:58,639 --> 00:13:59,839
the flip side of this

403
00:13:59,839 --> 00:14:02,720
we anticipate will be used as a critique

404
00:14:02,720 --> 00:14:03,440
of

405
00:14:03,440 --> 00:14:05,680
privacy preferences that are stored in

406
00:14:05,680 --> 00:14:06,800
the browser

407
00:14:06,800 --> 00:14:08,480
this is particularly true if the

408
00:14:08,480 --> 00:14:09,920
preference defaults

409
00:14:09,920 --> 00:14:12,880
to uptown for example already we see

410
00:14:12,880 --> 00:14:14,880
that the privacy badger

411
00:14:14,880 --> 00:14:17,839
add-on turns the gpc signal on as a

412
00:14:17,839 --> 00:14:20,320
default without collecting preferences

413
00:14:20,320 --> 00:14:22,240
now to some extent that's justified

414
00:14:22,240 --> 00:14:23,760
because this is a kind of pro

415
00:14:23,760 --> 00:14:27,199
privacy um add-on

416
00:14:27,199 --> 00:14:30,320
but then we anticipate that ad tech

417
00:14:30,320 --> 00:14:31,120
vendors will

418
00:14:31,120 --> 00:14:34,160
yeah kind of critique this especially

419
00:14:34,160 --> 00:14:35,279
because we saw

420
00:14:35,279 --> 00:14:38,000
with do not track that the internet

421
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:39,920
advertising bureau withdrew from the

422
00:14:39,920 --> 00:14:41,839
working group after microsoft

423
00:14:41,839 --> 00:14:45,120
turned it on by default another area

424
00:14:45,120 --> 00:14:47,440
with where nudges are controversial is

425
00:14:47,440 --> 00:14:49,279
in interface design

426
00:14:49,279 --> 00:14:51,440
so there's a huge body of work looking

427
00:14:51,440 --> 00:14:53,440
at dark patterns and that for instance

428
00:14:53,440 --> 00:14:54,639
will focus on

429
00:14:54,639 --> 00:14:57,760
the fact that most dialogues will have

430
00:14:57,760 --> 00:15:00,000
a one-click accept all whereas opting

431
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:01,920
out requires multiple clicks

432
00:15:01,920 --> 00:15:04,240
so here again we see how nudges that

433
00:15:04,240 --> 00:15:06,240
nudge users towards expressing certain

434
00:15:06,240 --> 00:15:07,360
preferences

435
00:15:07,360 --> 00:15:10,160
become very controversial this actually

436
00:15:10,160 --> 00:15:10,480
led

437
00:15:10,480 --> 00:15:13,360
an ngo none of your business to issue

438
00:15:13,360 --> 00:15:16,079
automated warnings to websites deploying

439
00:15:16,079 --> 00:15:19,519
non-compliant dialogues and it's unclear

440
00:15:19,519 --> 00:15:20,240
whether

441
00:15:20,240 --> 00:15:21,839
these complaints and surrounding

442
00:15:21,839 --> 00:15:23,600
regulatory action will actually

443
00:15:23,600 --> 00:15:27,120
threaten adoption of the signal or even

444
00:15:27,120 --> 00:15:28,880
whether they will change the design

445
00:15:28,880 --> 00:15:32,320
of the dialogues so

446
00:15:32,320 --> 00:15:34,000
our final question that we'd like to

447
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:35,759
leave with you is

448
00:15:35,759 --> 00:15:38,000
whether one global privacy preference

449
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:39,440
signal will emerge

450
00:15:39,440 --> 00:15:42,079
and we see two barriers to that the

451
00:15:42,079 --> 00:15:42,720
first

452
00:15:42,720 --> 00:15:45,199
is that two contradictory signals can be

453
00:15:45,199 --> 00:15:47,279
simultaneously sent

454
00:15:47,279 --> 00:15:50,320
you likely notice that gpc signals are

455
00:15:50,320 --> 00:15:51,680
sent as http

456
00:15:51,680 --> 00:15:54,880
headers and tcf signals are sent via

457
00:15:54,880 --> 00:15:57,839
javascript in the web page so users

458
00:15:57,839 --> 00:15:59,040
could very plausibly

459
00:15:59,040 --> 00:16:02,160
send an opt-in tcf signal through a

460
00:16:02,160 --> 00:16:03,279
browser with an

461
00:16:03,279 --> 00:16:06,639
opt-out gpc header turned on thus we do

462
00:16:06,639 --> 00:16:09,120
not expect one standard to definitively

463
00:16:09,120 --> 00:16:09,839
emerge

464
00:16:09,839 --> 00:16:13,360
like say vhs did over betamax

465
00:16:13,360 --> 00:16:15,370
a different barrier um

466
00:16:15,370 --> 00:16:16,639
[Music]

467
00:16:16,639 --> 00:16:19,199
is this trade-off between jurisdictional

468
00:16:19,199 --> 00:16:20,560
specificity

469
00:16:20,560 --> 00:16:23,600
and signal complexity the gps

470
00:16:23,600 --> 00:16:27,040
is a tremendously simple design

471
00:16:27,040 --> 00:16:29,759
in the specification but it very

472
00:16:29,759 --> 00:16:31,360
specifically

473
00:16:31,360 --> 00:16:33,440
and references a clause in the

474
00:16:33,440 --> 00:16:36,240
california consumer privacy act but in

475
00:16:36,240 --> 00:16:38,079
doing so in having a simple design

476
00:16:38,079 --> 00:16:39,680
that's very specific

477
00:16:39,680 --> 00:16:42,000
the problem is the signal now has a less

478
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:43,600
specific interpretation

479
00:16:43,600 --> 00:16:46,000
in other jurisdictions for instance in

480
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:47,199
other states or even

481
00:16:47,199 --> 00:16:50,720
international privacy laws so maybe

482
00:16:50,720 --> 00:16:52,800
instead of having just one global

483
00:16:52,800 --> 00:16:54,480
privacy preference signal

484
00:16:54,480 --> 00:16:55,920
we will actually have a series of

485
00:16:55,920 --> 00:16:58,079
signals each referencing a specific

486
00:16:58,079 --> 00:17:00,000
privacy law

487
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:02,480
so to conclude the talk it's worth

488
00:17:02,480 --> 00:17:03,440
noting that

489
00:17:03,440 --> 00:17:06,640
for more than 20 years we've now seen

490
00:17:06,640 --> 00:17:09,359
tremendous effort invested in privacy

491
00:17:09,359 --> 00:17:10,880
preference signals

492
00:17:10,880 --> 00:17:13,119
the fundamental problem is coordinating

493
00:17:13,119 --> 00:17:15,359
adaption between senders of the signal

494
00:17:15,359 --> 00:17:18,160
users and the intended recipients ad

495
00:17:18,160 --> 00:17:19,439
tech vendors

496
00:17:19,439 --> 00:17:21,679
per signals were largely ignored by

497
00:17:21,679 --> 00:17:22,720
edtech vendors

498
00:17:22,720 --> 00:17:25,439
who had no reason to receive the signal

499
00:17:25,439 --> 00:17:26,240
especially

500
00:17:26,240 --> 00:17:27,760
as there was little regulatory

501
00:17:27,760 --> 00:17:30,080
involvement in contrast

502
00:17:30,080 --> 00:17:32,240
ad tech vendors rapidly adapted the

503
00:17:32,240 --> 00:17:33,760
transparency

504
00:17:33,760 --> 00:17:37,039
consent framework and by 2021 it had

505
00:17:37,039 --> 00:17:39,360
become the dominant signal

506
00:17:39,360 --> 00:17:41,679
the timing of adaption suggests gdpr

507
00:17:41,679 --> 00:17:43,520
coming into effect was a key driver of

508
00:17:43,520 --> 00:17:44,720
adaption

509
00:17:44,720 --> 00:17:47,760
we also presented evidence that business

510
00:17:47,760 --> 00:17:49,440
relationships help explain which

511
00:17:49,440 --> 00:17:50,080
websites

512
00:17:50,080 --> 00:17:53,039
adapt tcf

513
00:17:53,520 --> 00:17:55,840
so looking to future work it is not

514
00:17:55,840 --> 00:17:57,840
clear that tcf will be the dominant

515
00:17:57,840 --> 00:17:58,799
signal

516
00:17:58,799 --> 00:18:00,880
or even whether a dominant signal can

517
00:18:00,880 --> 00:18:01,919
exist

518
00:18:01,919 --> 00:18:04,320
we should thus expect a future of

519
00:18:04,320 --> 00:18:06,480
co-existing privacy signals

520
00:18:06,480 --> 00:18:08,240
with each referencing a different legal

521
00:18:08,240 --> 00:18:15,840
basis and jurisdiction

522
00:18:16,240 --> 00:18:18,320
