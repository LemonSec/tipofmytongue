1
00:00:00,640 --> 00:00:02,960
hi and welcome to our talk on data

2
00:00:02,960 --> 00:00:05,680
portability between online services

3
00:00:05,680 --> 00:00:08,240
imagine the following scenario you're a

4
00:00:08,240 --> 00:00:10,160
long time user of an online service

5
00:00:10,160 --> 00:00:13,200
like a social network or a file hoster

6
00:00:13,200 --> 00:00:14,799
over time you have accumulated a lot of

7
00:00:14,799 --> 00:00:16,880
data there and now you'd like to switch

8
00:00:16,880 --> 00:00:17,600
to a new

9
00:00:17,600 --> 00:00:20,160
cooler online service however you're

10
00:00:20,160 --> 00:00:22,000
hesitant to do so because transferring

11
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:23,519
all that data from the old service to

12
00:00:23,519 --> 00:00:24,560
the new service

13
00:00:24,560 --> 00:00:28,320
is just too much work privacy regulation

14
00:00:28,320 --> 00:00:30,880
like the european union's gdpr

15
00:00:30,880 --> 00:00:32,640
promises to make this process much

16
00:00:32,640 --> 00:00:34,079
easier

17
00:00:34,079 --> 00:00:37,280
but how well does it really work my name

18
00:00:37,280 --> 00:00:38,800
is emanuel sumudis

19
00:00:38,800 --> 00:00:40,480
i'm a phd student at the technical

20
00:00:40,480 --> 00:00:42,640
university of munich

21
00:00:42,640 --> 00:00:44,879
and in a team with stefan marga sophie

22
00:00:44,879 --> 00:00:46,000
kubler-vachendorf

23
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:49,120
paul pizzinini jens krostlux and johan

24
00:00:49,120 --> 00:00:49,840
krantz

25
00:00:49,840 --> 00:00:52,239
we've empirically analyzed how effective

26
00:00:52,239 --> 00:00:54,559
the writer data portability of the gdpr

27
00:00:54,559 --> 00:00:58,079
is as of today when analyzing

28
00:00:58,079 --> 00:00:59,680
data-driven markets

29
00:00:59,680 --> 00:01:02,800
we often see the same pattern there are

30
00:01:02,800 --> 00:01:04,159
one or very few

31
00:01:04,159 --> 00:01:06,240
dominant services who gather a lot of

32
00:01:06,240 --> 00:01:07,200
data

33
00:01:07,200 --> 00:01:09,119
and have no incentive to share that data

34
00:01:09,119 --> 00:01:11,520
with other services

35
00:01:11,520 --> 00:01:13,520
for a market entrant it's very difficult

36
00:01:13,520 --> 00:01:15,040
to establish themselves

37
00:01:15,040 --> 00:01:16,799
in the market as they just lack that

38
00:01:16,799 --> 00:01:18,880
amount of data

39
00:01:18,880 --> 00:01:20,720
data portability regulation now wants to

40
00:01:20,720 --> 00:01:22,400
make it easier for these services to

41
00:01:22,400 --> 00:01:23,840
gather the data

42
00:01:23,840 --> 00:01:25,520
as it is easier for individuals to

43
00:01:25,520 --> 00:01:27,040
transfer their data from their own

44
00:01:27,040 --> 00:01:30,240
service to the market entrance

45
00:01:30,240 --> 00:01:32,880
we therefore want to find out how well

46
00:01:32,880 --> 00:01:34,400
data portability

47
00:01:34,400 --> 00:01:36,400
currently delivers on this promise to

48
00:01:36,400 --> 00:01:38,640
allow individuals to transfer their data

49
00:01:38,640 --> 00:01:41,920
from one provider to another therefore

50
00:01:41,920 --> 00:01:43,520
we look at three different sub

51
00:01:43,520 --> 00:01:46,479
questions on the one hand we want to

52
00:01:46,479 --> 00:01:47,439
find out

53
00:01:47,439 --> 00:01:50,240
what scope of personal data do online

54
00:01:50,240 --> 00:01:51,920
services provide to individuals when

55
00:01:51,920 --> 00:01:54,960
they request a data export

56
00:01:54,960 --> 00:01:57,840
then which of options do online services

57
00:01:57,840 --> 00:02:00,000
offer individuals to import

58
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:03,680
their previously exported data

59
00:02:03,680 --> 00:02:07,040
and in on a more general view

60
00:02:07,040 --> 00:02:09,840
how quickly securely and to what level

61
00:02:09,840 --> 00:02:11,680
of compliancy with gdpr

62
00:02:11,680 --> 00:02:14,640
article 20 is personal data transmitted

63
00:02:14,640 --> 00:02:16,800
to individuals

64
00:02:16,800 --> 00:02:20,480
the gdpr became effective in may 2018

65
00:02:20,480 --> 00:02:22,959
and this is the first time that a data

66
00:02:22,959 --> 00:02:24,000
regulation

67
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:26,400
explicitly contains a right to data

68
00:02:26,400 --> 00:02:27,680
portability for

69
00:02:27,680 --> 00:02:30,720
individuals in the gdpr

70
00:02:30,720 --> 00:02:32,959
the right to data portability is defined

71
00:02:32,959 --> 00:02:34,400
in article 20

72
00:02:34,400 --> 00:02:37,200
and contains two sub rights the first

73
00:02:37,200 --> 00:02:37,840
subright

74
00:02:37,840 --> 00:02:40,640
allows an individual to request a copy

75
00:02:40,640 --> 00:02:42,480
of their personal data

76
00:02:42,480 --> 00:02:46,800
and to receive that data themselves

77
00:02:46,800 --> 00:02:48,959
the second subrise allows the individual

78
00:02:48,959 --> 00:02:50,000
to request

79
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:52,319
a data controller to directly transfer

80
00:02:52,319 --> 00:02:53,360
that data

81
00:02:53,360 --> 00:02:56,480
to another service however this second

82
00:02:56,480 --> 00:02:58,879
subwrite comes with a limitation

83
00:02:58,879 --> 00:03:01,040
that is it can be requested if

84
00:03:01,040 --> 00:03:03,840
technically feasible

85
00:03:03,840 --> 00:03:05,680
of today we see that other privacy

86
00:03:05,680 --> 00:03:08,400
regulations also have adopted a

87
00:03:08,400 --> 00:03:10,800
right to data portability for instance

88
00:03:10,800 --> 00:03:12,560
in california

89
00:03:12,560 --> 00:03:15,599
in brazil or in india

90
00:03:15,599 --> 00:03:18,000
article 20 contains some requirements on

91
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:18,959
how a data

92
00:03:18,959 --> 00:03:22,000
export has to be provided namely the

93
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:24,000
data has to be provided in a structured

94
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:25,599
commonly used and machine readable

95
00:03:25,599 --> 00:03:27,200
format

96
00:03:27,200 --> 00:03:29,519
that is if you request your data from a

97
00:03:29,519 --> 00:03:30,959
service provider

98
00:03:30,959 --> 00:03:33,519
and they just send you a screenshot of

99
00:03:33,519 --> 00:03:35,200
your database entries

100
00:03:35,200 --> 00:03:37,920
this data is not in a compliant format

101
00:03:37,920 --> 00:03:39,760
long and henderson have studies

102
00:03:39,760 --> 00:03:42,000
studied multiple data formats uh income

103
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:42,959
which are compliant

104
00:03:42,959 --> 00:03:44,720
or not compliant with the right data

105
00:03:44,720 --> 00:03:46,000
portability in

106
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:49,200
2019 and they have found that especially

107
00:03:49,200 --> 00:03:53,680
csv json and xml are compliant

108
00:03:53,680 --> 00:03:57,200
however even if let's say json is used

109
00:03:57,200 --> 00:03:58,400
for a data export

110
00:03:58,400 --> 00:04:01,040
the data can still be unstructured if

111
00:04:01,040 --> 00:04:03,360
all the data is contained as plain text

112
00:04:03,360 --> 00:04:04,159
in one

113
00:04:04,159 --> 00:04:06,959
key value pair however let's say these

114
00:04:06,959 --> 00:04:09,040
formats have the potential to be

115
00:04:09,040 --> 00:04:11,040
compliant with the provisions of article

116
00:04:11,040 --> 00:04:13,200
20 gdpr

117
00:04:13,200 --> 00:04:14,879
another important aspect of data

118
00:04:14,879 --> 00:04:17,358
portability is the scope of data

119
00:04:17,358 --> 00:04:19,440
provided in an export

120
00:04:19,440 --> 00:04:21,680
the herded i'll define four different

121
00:04:21,680 --> 00:04:23,759
types of data

122
00:04:23,759 --> 00:04:26,000
on the one hand there's receive data

123
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:28,000
which is data actively provided by

124
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:30,960
the user for instance a post on a social

125
00:04:30,960 --> 00:04:32,639
network

126
00:04:32,639 --> 00:04:34,720
then there is observed data which is

127
00:04:34,720 --> 00:04:36,639
data that's still provided by a user but

128
00:04:36,639 --> 00:04:38,320
in a more passive way

129
00:04:38,320 --> 00:04:40,880
for instance locational data gathered by

130
00:04:40,880 --> 00:04:43,040
their smartphones

131
00:04:43,040 --> 00:04:45,360
then there's inferred data and predicted

132
00:04:45,360 --> 00:04:46,240
data

133
00:04:46,240 --> 00:04:48,479
which is data that is produced using

134
00:04:48,479 --> 00:04:50,400
received and observed data

135
00:04:50,400 --> 00:04:52,320
to learn something about the user for

136
00:04:52,320 --> 00:04:53,759
instance

137
00:04:53,759 --> 00:04:55,919
they have listened to these songs on a

138
00:04:55,919 --> 00:04:57,520
streaming platform and now

139
00:04:57,520 --> 00:04:59,120
with a certain probability they might

140
00:04:59,120 --> 00:05:02,080
want to visit a concert

141
00:05:02,080 --> 00:05:04,639
they had it argued that there are two

142
00:05:04,639 --> 00:05:06,320
interpretations of the right to date

143
00:05:06,320 --> 00:05:07,759
abortability

144
00:05:07,759 --> 00:05:09,600
on the one hand a narrow interpretation

145
00:05:09,600 --> 00:05:11,520
where a service only has to include

146
00:05:11,520 --> 00:05:14,960
receive data and a wider interpretation

147
00:05:14,960 --> 00:05:16,639
where the service also has to include

148
00:05:16,639 --> 00:05:19,280
observed data in the data export

149
00:05:19,280 --> 00:05:21,039
as of today there's no functioning

150
00:05:21,039 --> 00:05:22,479
infrastructure for

151
00:05:22,479 --> 00:05:24,720
directly transferring data from one data

152
00:05:24,720 --> 00:05:26,560
controller to another

153
00:05:26,560 --> 00:05:28,160
therefore in our study we focused on

154
00:05:28,160 --> 00:05:31,039
so-called indirect data portability

155
00:05:31,039 --> 00:05:33,039
that is requesting a data export from

156
00:05:33,039 --> 00:05:35,199
one controller for instance facebook

157
00:05:35,199 --> 00:05:37,759
storing it on the own computer and then

158
00:05:37,759 --> 00:05:39,440
trying to import it

159
00:05:39,440 --> 00:05:41,039
at another controller for instance

160
00:05:41,039 --> 00:05:43,120
mastodon

161
00:05:43,120 --> 00:05:45,199
in our data set we therefore have

162
00:05:45,199 --> 00:05:46,320
different aspects

163
00:05:46,320 --> 00:05:48,880
of this data transfer process on the one

164
00:05:48,880 --> 00:05:51,759
hand we have data on the export requests

165
00:05:51,759 --> 00:05:54,160
we have data on the import capabilities

166
00:05:54,160 --> 00:05:55,759
of online services

167
00:05:55,759 --> 00:05:58,000
we have the alexa ranks of all services

168
00:05:58,000 --> 00:05:59,120
to have a proxy for

169
00:05:59,120 --> 00:06:03,199
their popularity and using nase industry

170
00:06:03,199 --> 00:06:04,840
codes we created a

171
00:06:04,840 --> 00:06:07,600
industry we created industry categories

172
00:06:07,600 --> 00:06:10,080
in order to be able to classify the

173
00:06:10,080 --> 00:06:11,120
services

174
00:06:11,120 --> 00:06:14,240
we couldn't use any of the classical

175
00:06:14,240 --> 00:06:16,400
existing industry classifications

176
00:06:16,400 --> 00:06:18,000
as they just turned out to be too

177
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:20,400
outdated for instance classifying

178
00:06:20,400 --> 00:06:21,680
facebook just as

179
00:06:21,680 --> 00:06:25,600
other information service so now on the

180
00:06:25,600 --> 00:06:28,960
data collection itself we requested a

181
00:06:28,960 --> 00:06:30,479
data export at

182
00:06:30,479 --> 00:06:33,600
182 services in total the sample here

183
00:06:33,600 --> 00:06:34,560
consists

184
00:06:34,560 --> 00:06:36,800
of personal accounts of the author that

185
00:06:36,800 --> 00:06:38,639
were already existing when conducting

186
00:06:38,639 --> 00:06:39,759
the study

187
00:06:39,759 --> 00:06:42,319
and in addition we checked the german

188
00:06:42,319 --> 00:06:44,400
alexa top 100 ranking

189
00:06:44,400 --> 00:06:46,479
and added missing services to make sure

190
00:06:46,479 --> 00:06:48,560
we don't miss

191
00:06:48,560 --> 00:06:51,759
important services in our sample where

192
00:06:51,759 --> 00:06:53,599
possible we then

193
00:06:53,599 --> 00:06:56,800
exported the data via the web interface

194
00:06:56,800 --> 00:06:58,000
of the service

195
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:00,000
if that was not possible we wrote an

196
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:01,360
email to the

197
00:07:01,360 --> 00:07:05,039
data protection officer or the customer

198
00:07:05,039 --> 00:07:05,759
support

199
00:07:05,759 --> 00:07:07,840
and requested an expert of our data

200
00:07:07,840 --> 00:07:10,400
under article 20 gdpr

201
00:07:10,400 --> 00:07:12,479
as the table on the left shows our

202
00:07:12,479 --> 00:07:14,639
sample consists of a pretty good mix of

203
00:07:14,639 --> 00:07:15,039
both

204
00:07:15,039 --> 00:07:17,360
popular and less popular services with

205
00:07:17,360 --> 00:07:20,319
regard to the worldwide alexa rank

206
00:07:20,319 --> 00:07:23,039
which then allows us to analyze whether

207
00:07:23,039 --> 00:07:24,960
these services have any differences in

208
00:07:24,960 --> 00:07:28,400
their data portability practices

209
00:07:28,400 --> 00:07:30,400
regarding the data import options of

210
00:07:30,400 --> 00:07:31,680
services

211
00:07:31,680 --> 00:07:35,280
we looked at a sample of 190 services

212
00:07:35,280 --> 00:07:37,440
here we first identified each service's

213
00:07:37,440 --> 00:07:38,960
core functionalities

214
00:07:38,960 --> 00:07:41,360
for instance for a email provider this

215
00:07:41,360 --> 00:07:43,280
could be storing emails and

216
00:07:43,280 --> 00:07:46,160
storing calendars for instance then we

217
00:07:46,160 --> 00:07:46,960
checked

218
00:07:46,960 --> 00:07:49,120
each inspected each service in three

219
00:07:49,120 --> 00:07:50,400
different ways

220
00:07:50,400 --> 00:07:52,479
we inspected the web interface if there

221
00:07:52,479 --> 00:07:55,120
are any options for importing data

222
00:07:55,120 --> 00:07:56,479
we inspected the help files and

223
00:07:56,479 --> 00:07:58,560
documentation of the services if we find

224
00:07:58,560 --> 00:08:01,120
any instructions how to import data

225
00:08:01,120 --> 00:08:03,199
and we use search engine and search for

226
00:08:03,199 --> 00:08:05,039
how to import data at these particular

227
00:08:05,039 --> 00:08:06,240
services

228
00:08:06,240 --> 00:08:08,160
and in addition for each service we

229
00:08:08,160 --> 00:08:10,319
gathered whether there are

230
00:08:10,319 --> 00:08:14,479
single sign-on options via oauth

231
00:08:14,479 --> 00:08:16,879
the next table gives a brief overview on

232
00:08:16,879 --> 00:08:17,919
the measures used

233
00:08:17,919 --> 00:08:21,680
in our study so for the export requests

234
00:08:21,680 --> 00:08:24,560
we have data on the export scope on how

235
00:08:24,560 --> 00:08:27,120
to request the data export

236
00:08:27,120 --> 00:08:28,960
how to authenticate in order to receive

237
00:08:28,960 --> 00:08:30,960
it how it was transmitted

238
00:08:30,960 --> 00:08:32,880
and how long it took until our request

239
00:08:32,880 --> 00:08:34,320
was completed

240
00:08:34,320 --> 00:08:36,559
we further have variables on the overall

241
00:08:36,559 --> 00:08:37,760
compliance

242
00:08:37,760 --> 00:08:40,719
with article 20 gdpr and on the import

243
00:08:40,719 --> 00:08:41,360
side

244
00:08:41,360 --> 00:08:43,839
we have data on the scope of the

245
00:08:43,839 --> 00:08:45,360
possible imports

246
00:08:45,360 --> 00:08:48,880
and if there were any options to

247
00:08:48,880 --> 00:08:51,839
use oauth to transfer data we further

248
00:08:51,839 --> 00:08:53,760
have data from the alexa database and

249
00:08:53,760 --> 00:08:55,279
orbis database in our

250
00:08:55,279 --> 00:08:58,480
data set in order to analyze the data

251
00:08:58,480 --> 00:09:01,120
we've developed several hypotheses on

252
00:09:01,120 --> 00:09:01,519
the

253
00:09:01,519 --> 00:09:04,880
data portability practices especially of

254
00:09:04,880 --> 00:09:08,000
popular versus less popular services we

255
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:10,640
face these hypotheses on the on existing

256
00:09:10,640 --> 00:09:11,920
economic models

257
00:09:11,920 --> 00:09:14,240
on data portability which essentially

258
00:09:14,240 --> 00:09:15,120
say that

259
00:09:15,120 --> 00:09:19,200
market entrance or less popular services

260
00:09:19,200 --> 00:09:21,279
profit from data portability and

261
00:09:21,279 --> 00:09:23,440
therefore have a higher incentive to

262
00:09:23,440 --> 00:09:27,279
to use data portability our hypotheses

263
00:09:27,279 --> 00:09:29,600
therefore are as follows

264
00:09:29,600 --> 00:09:34,000
we assume that more popular services

265
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:36,880
are over or more compliant with article

266
00:09:36,880 --> 00:09:37,680
20 as

267
00:09:37,680 --> 00:09:40,880
they fear higher fines then we assume

268
00:09:40,880 --> 00:09:42,560
that popular services

269
00:09:42,560 --> 00:09:44,959
export data with a smaller scope in

270
00:09:44,959 --> 00:09:45,920
order to

271
00:09:45,920 --> 00:09:49,279
be less usable we assume that popular

272
00:09:49,279 --> 00:09:50,080
services

273
00:09:50,080 --> 00:09:52,080
require more authentication steps to

274
00:09:52,080 --> 00:09:53,760
make it more difficult to

275
00:09:53,760 --> 00:09:56,560
receive a data export we also assume

276
00:09:56,560 --> 00:09:57,279
that

277
00:09:57,279 --> 00:09:59,600
popular services take a longer time to

278
00:09:59,600 --> 00:10:00,480
make

279
00:10:00,480 --> 00:10:02,240
until the export is completed in order

280
00:10:02,240 --> 00:10:04,320
to make it less usable

281
00:10:04,320 --> 00:10:07,440
and we assume that less popular services

282
00:10:07,440 --> 00:10:09,680
have more import possibilities in order

283
00:10:09,680 --> 00:10:11,760
to make use of a right to data

284
00:10:11,760 --> 00:10:13,440
portability

285
00:10:13,440 --> 00:10:14,959
let me first show you some descriptive

286
00:10:14,959 --> 00:10:18,079
results out of the 182 data export

287
00:10:18,079 --> 00:10:19,040
requests

288
00:10:19,040 --> 00:10:21,760
45 could be made via a dedicated request

289
00:10:21,760 --> 00:10:22,959
button

290
00:10:22,959 --> 00:10:25,839
23 services offered a dedicated request

291
00:10:25,839 --> 00:10:27,120
form

292
00:10:27,120 --> 00:10:29,279
and the other 114 services had to be

293
00:10:29,279 --> 00:10:31,279
contacted via email

294
00:10:31,279 --> 00:10:34,560
in the end 135 services

295
00:10:34,560 --> 00:10:37,600
answered our data export request with a

296
00:10:37,600 --> 00:10:40,079
average export duration that is the time

297
00:10:40,079 --> 00:10:41,120
needed

298
00:10:41,120 --> 00:10:44,560
until the export was completed of 9.5

299
00:10:44,560 --> 00:10:45,360
days

300
00:10:45,360 --> 00:10:48,800
and a median duration of four days

301
00:10:48,800 --> 00:10:51,120
in order to provide the data export a

302
00:10:51,120 --> 00:10:53,440
majority of 77 percent of services

303
00:10:53,440 --> 00:10:55,519
required one or more authentication

304
00:10:55,519 --> 00:10:56,880
steps

305
00:10:56,880 --> 00:10:58,560
the most frequent one was requiring the

306
00:10:58,560 --> 00:11:00,720
user to login to their account with

307
00:11:00,720 --> 00:11:04,160
52 percent of services did 24

308
00:11:04,160 --> 00:11:07,120
of services required to click a link in

309
00:11:07,120 --> 00:11:07,519
a

310
00:11:07,519 --> 00:11:10,000
confirmation email and four percent of

311
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:12,240
services even required to send

312
00:11:12,240 --> 00:11:15,519
a copy of an id card

313
00:11:15,519 --> 00:11:17,680
for the transmission of the data we see

314
00:11:17,680 --> 00:11:19,600
very mixed transmission rates the most

315
00:11:19,600 --> 00:11:20,880
frequent one was

316
00:11:20,880 --> 00:11:24,000
sending a download link in an email

317
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:25,920
often the data was also sent as an

318
00:11:25,920 --> 00:11:29,120
attachment in an email

319
00:11:29,120 --> 00:11:31,040
taking a closer look at the actual data

320
00:11:31,040 --> 00:11:32,160
exports

321
00:11:32,160 --> 00:11:35,200
we find that 51 of exports are in httpr

322
00:11:35,200 --> 00:11:37,279
compliant format

323
00:11:37,279 --> 00:11:40,839
most often experts are in a csv or json

324
00:11:40,839 --> 00:11:42,320
format

325
00:11:42,320 --> 00:11:44,880
regarding the expert scope we find that

326
00:11:44,880 --> 00:11:45,760
62

327
00:11:45,760 --> 00:11:48,880
of services not only include received

328
00:11:48,880 --> 00:11:49,519
but also

329
00:11:49,519 --> 00:11:52,560
observed data of the user in addition

330
00:11:52,560 --> 00:11:54,240
nine percent of experts

331
00:11:54,240 --> 00:11:57,839
even include inferred data

332
00:11:58,160 --> 00:11:59,920
we further analyze the overall

333
00:11:59,920 --> 00:12:02,240
compliance of services with article 20

334
00:12:02,240 --> 00:12:04,160
gdpr

335
00:12:04,160 --> 00:12:06,320
compliance here means that a service has

336
00:12:06,320 --> 00:12:08,240
delivery data export within the legally

337
00:12:08,240 --> 00:12:09,600
permitted time frame

338
00:12:09,600 --> 00:12:13,279
of 30 plus 60 days that

339
00:12:13,279 --> 00:12:16,079
the data expert was complete that is no

340
00:12:16,079 --> 00:12:17,600
received data of us

341
00:12:17,600 --> 00:12:20,639
was missing in the data export

342
00:12:20,639 --> 00:12:22,880
and that the file format was machine

343
00:12:22,880 --> 00:12:24,000
readable structured and

344
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:26,720
commonly used and overall we find that

345
00:12:26,720 --> 00:12:28,000
only 29

346
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:30,480
of services in our sample were compliant

347
00:12:30,480 --> 00:12:34,959
with the terms of article 20 gdpr

348
00:12:35,600 --> 00:12:37,760
when analyzing the import capabilities

349
00:12:37,760 --> 00:12:38,880
of services

350
00:12:38,880 --> 00:12:40,959
we find that a large majority of 77

351
00:12:40,959 --> 00:12:43,279
percent does not offer any import

352
00:12:43,279 --> 00:12:45,279
possibilities at all

353
00:12:45,279 --> 00:12:46,800
that is for these services there's not

354
00:12:46,800 --> 00:12:48,639
even a theoretical

355
00:12:48,639 --> 00:12:50,959
chance to import data previously

356
00:12:50,959 --> 00:12:54,240
exported as one of their competitors

357
00:12:54,240 --> 00:12:56,240
one notable exception is the survey

358
00:12:56,240 --> 00:12:57,920
marketing and web analytics

359
00:12:57,920 --> 00:13:00,639
industry sector where more than

360
00:13:00,639 --> 00:13:02,560
two-thirds of services offer at least

361
00:13:02,560 --> 00:13:03,440
some

362
00:13:03,440 --> 00:13:06,480
type of import possibility

363
00:13:06,480 --> 00:13:08,560
in order to test our hypotheses we've

364
00:13:08,560 --> 00:13:11,920
used ordered logic and ols regressions

365
00:13:11,920 --> 00:13:13,040
let me highlight the three most

366
00:13:13,040 --> 00:13:16,160
important results here

367
00:13:16,480 --> 00:13:18,639
regarding the gdpr compliance of

368
00:13:18,639 --> 00:13:19,760
services

369
00:13:19,760 --> 00:13:22,160
we find that more popular services

370
00:13:22,160 --> 00:13:23,040
indeed

371
00:13:23,040 --> 00:13:25,600
export their data in a more compliant

372
00:13:25,600 --> 00:13:27,120
format

373
00:13:27,120 --> 00:13:29,200
however regarding the overall compliance

374
00:13:29,200 --> 00:13:32,880
we cannot see a significant effect

375
00:13:32,880 --> 00:13:35,600
interestingly for hypothesis 2 where we

376
00:13:35,600 --> 00:13:37,200
assumed that

377
00:13:37,200 --> 00:13:39,440
more popular service export data with a

378
00:13:39,440 --> 00:13:40,639
lower scope

379
00:13:40,639 --> 00:13:43,120
we find the exact opposite effect more

380
00:13:43,120 --> 00:13:44,399
popular services

381
00:13:44,399 --> 00:13:47,199
export data with a richer scope

382
00:13:47,199 --> 00:13:49,199
similarly for hypothesis 5

383
00:13:49,199 --> 00:13:50,720
where we assume that less popular

384
00:13:50,720 --> 00:13:53,440
services which do want to make use of a

385
00:13:53,440 --> 00:13:55,040
right to date abortability

386
00:13:55,040 --> 00:13:58,399
offer more import possibilities

387
00:13:58,399 --> 00:14:01,760
exactly the opposite is the case

388
00:14:01,760 --> 00:14:04,320
more popular services offer more import

389
00:14:04,320 --> 00:14:07,120
possibilities

390
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:10,079
as seen on the previous slide we find

391
00:14:10,079 --> 00:14:12,000
that more popular services both

392
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:14,480
export data with a higher scope and give

393
00:14:14,480 --> 00:14:16,160
better options to import data than their

394
00:14:16,160 --> 00:14:18,240
smaller competitors

395
00:14:18,240 --> 00:14:20,560
one could argue that small services

396
00:14:20,560 --> 00:14:22,240
regard data portability more as an

397
00:14:22,240 --> 00:14:23,199
obligation

398
00:14:23,199 --> 00:14:25,440
and do not see that much of a chance for

399
00:14:25,440 --> 00:14:27,680
growth in a market in it

400
00:14:27,680 --> 00:14:29,360
the question is therefore why is this

401
00:14:29,360 --> 00:14:32,160
the case and how can data portability

402
00:14:32,160 --> 00:14:33,920
become a more successful user right than

403
00:14:33,920 --> 00:14:36,320
it is today

404
00:14:36,320 --> 00:14:38,959
in our data set we found two examples

405
00:14:38,959 --> 00:14:40,320
where we think

406
00:14:40,320 --> 00:14:42,320
that a successful data transfer from

407
00:14:42,320 --> 00:14:44,800
service a to service b is already

408
00:14:44,800 --> 00:14:46,079
possible today

409
00:14:46,079 --> 00:14:47,600
the first example is the finance

410
00:14:47,600 --> 00:14:50,240
industry especially banks

411
00:14:50,240 --> 00:14:52,000
and the reason here is that there's

412
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:53,360
simply a stricter and

413
00:14:53,360 --> 00:14:55,440
even more precise regulation than data

414
00:14:55,440 --> 00:14:57,920
portability which forces banks to allow

415
00:14:57,920 --> 00:15:00,160
an easy transfer of accounts from bank a

416
00:15:00,160 --> 00:15:02,079
to bank b

417
00:15:02,079 --> 00:15:04,320
but we've also seen services from the

418
00:15:04,320 --> 00:15:05,680
fitness industry

419
00:15:05,680 --> 00:15:07,680
where apparently there is that much of a

420
00:15:07,680 --> 00:15:09,440
self-interest to collect as much health

421
00:15:09,440 --> 00:15:10,800
data as possible

422
00:15:10,800 --> 00:15:13,199
that these services offer comprehensive

423
00:15:13,199 --> 00:15:15,120
import possibilities as well as

424
00:15:15,120 --> 00:15:18,480
comprehensive exports instead of rather

425
00:15:18,480 --> 00:15:19,360
complicated

426
00:15:19,360 --> 00:15:22,160
indirect data transfers one could also

427
00:15:22,160 --> 00:15:23,680
implement data portability

428
00:15:23,680 --> 00:15:26,240
in a more direct way using established

429
00:15:26,240 --> 00:15:29,680
protocols like oauth for single sign-on

430
00:15:29,680 --> 00:15:32,720
regarding oauth we find that 45 of

431
00:15:32,720 --> 00:15:34,320
services in our sample

432
00:15:34,320 --> 00:15:36,240
already offer one or more single sign-on

433
00:15:36,240 --> 00:15:37,920
options

434
00:15:37,920 --> 00:15:39,279
one could argue that this also

435
00:15:39,279 --> 00:15:41,040
constitutes some kind of data

436
00:15:41,040 --> 00:15:43,759
portability as there is a transfer of

437
00:15:43,759 --> 00:15:46,240
personal data to the service offering

438
00:15:46,240 --> 00:15:50,160
single sign-on taking place however

439
00:15:50,160 --> 00:15:52,160
these transfers usually consist of a

440
00:15:52,160 --> 00:15:54,399
very limited amount of personal data

441
00:15:54,399 --> 00:15:57,440
from either facebook or google

442
00:15:57,440 --> 00:15:59,199
there are also two-way solutions under

443
00:15:59,199 --> 00:16:00,959
development for instance the

444
00:16:00,959 --> 00:16:04,079
data transfer project however these

445
00:16:04,079 --> 00:16:05,360
solutions are not

446
00:16:05,360 --> 00:16:08,399
yet taking place

447
00:16:08,399 --> 00:16:10,880
our study leaves multiple questions or

448
00:16:10,880 --> 00:16:13,040
challenges open for future work

449
00:16:13,040 --> 00:16:15,279
which can help data portability to

450
00:16:15,279 --> 00:16:17,759
become more successful

451
00:16:17,759 --> 00:16:20,000
on the one hand we need to know when

452
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:22,000
data portability really is needed by

453
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:25,920
consumers then how to encourage

454
00:16:25,920 --> 00:16:29,600
services to really offer data imports

455
00:16:29,600 --> 00:16:32,399
what fraction of data is really useful

456
00:16:32,399 --> 00:16:34,839
in terms of being reused by another

457
00:16:34,839 --> 00:16:36,000
service

458
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:38,320
and finally how can this whole data

459
00:16:38,320 --> 00:16:39,600
affordability process

460
00:16:39,600 --> 00:16:41,759
be standardized in order to be more

461
00:16:41,759 --> 00:16:45,040
usable than it is today

462
00:16:45,040 --> 00:16:47,839
to wrap up our study finds that even two

463
00:16:47,839 --> 00:16:49,360
years after the gdpr

464
00:16:49,360 --> 00:16:51,680
entered into force there were still only

465
00:16:51,680 --> 00:16:53,839
very limited options for data transfer

466
00:16:53,839 --> 00:16:55,120
through the means of indirect data

467
00:16:55,120 --> 00:16:57,040
portability

468
00:16:57,040 --> 00:16:59,279
surprisingly we also find that the

469
00:16:59,279 --> 00:17:01,199
popularity of online services

470
00:17:01,199 --> 00:17:03,040
has a positive influence on both the

471
00:17:03,040 --> 00:17:04,880
scope of data exports

472
00:17:04,880 --> 00:17:06,640
and the data import options that are

473
00:17:06,640 --> 00:17:08,799
made available

474
00:17:08,799 --> 00:17:10,319
let me conclude with possible

475
00:17:10,319 --> 00:17:13,039
limitations of our study

476
00:17:13,039 --> 00:17:15,199
as explained in the method section our

477
00:17:15,199 --> 00:17:17,119
sample partially

478
00:17:17,119 --> 00:17:19,839
consists of services where we as the

479
00:17:19,839 --> 00:17:20,640
authors

480
00:17:20,640 --> 00:17:22,160
already had an existing account and

481
00:17:22,160 --> 00:17:23,839
therefore therefore is a partial

482
00:17:23,839 --> 00:17:25,520
convenience sample

483
00:17:25,520 --> 00:17:27,439
we would of course love to see our study

484
00:17:27,439 --> 00:17:29,360
replicated with a different or even

485
00:17:29,360 --> 00:17:32,640
larger sample

486
00:17:32,640 --> 00:17:35,120
then to be able to compare services

487
00:17:35,120 --> 00:17:36,559
across industries

488
00:17:36,559 --> 00:17:39,280
we could not directly use an existing

489
00:17:39,280 --> 00:17:40,960
industry categorization as they are

490
00:17:40,960 --> 00:17:42,320
heavily outdated

491
00:17:42,320 --> 00:17:44,000
and therefore had to create our own

492
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:46,640
industry categorization based on nays

493
00:17:46,640 --> 00:17:48,559
this highlights the need to update

494
00:17:48,559 --> 00:17:50,799
current industry classifications

495
00:17:50,799 --> 00:17:52,960
to reflect the diversity of today's

496
00:17:52,960 --> 00:17:55,280
online markets

497
00:17:55,280 --> 00:17:57,840
this concludes our talk thank you very

498
00:17:57,840 --> 00:18:01,039
much for your attention
