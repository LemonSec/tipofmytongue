1
00:00:01,439 --> 00:00:03,760
hi everyone thank you for being here

2
00:00:03,760 --> 00:00:05,839
so today i will be telling you about

3
00:00:05,839 --> 00:00:08,160
definitions and privacy policies

4
00:00:08,160 --> 00:00:10,080
and more specifically how users

5
00:00:10,080 --> 00:00:11,840
interpret or rather misinterpret the

6
00:00:11,840 --> 00:00:13,840
technical terms that appear in them

7
00:00:13,840 --> 00:00:15,839
so since to talk about definitions i

8
00:00:15,839 --> 00:00:17,440
will definitely be defining

9
00:00:17,440 --> 00:00:19,359
some of these terms such as which

10
00:00:19,359 --> 00:00:21,119
technical terms am i talking about

11
00:00:21,119 --> 00:00:22,800
and what sense are we using by looking

12
00:00:22,800 --> 00:00:24,480
at user interpretations

13
00:00:24,480 --> 00:00:27,519
and here is a privacy policy so

14
00:00:27,519 --> 00:00:29,279
if you've been around on the internet

15
00:00:29,279 --> 00:00:31,119
you've probably seen something like this

16
00:00:31,119 --> 00:00:31,679
right

17
00:00:31,679 --> 00:00:34,239
huge blocks of text a lot of words that

18
00:00:34,239 --> 00:00:36,320
you definitely have read

19
00:00:36,320 --> 00:00:39,360
and you've probably checked a box or 10

20
00:00:39,360 --> 00:00:40,879
that looks something like this saying

21
00:00:40,879 --> 00:00:42,719
you've read and agreed to the terms of

22
00:00:42,719 --> 00:00:44,800
service and privacy calls

23
00:00:44,800 --> 00:00:46,719
or you may have also seen pop-ups that

24
00:00:46,719 --> 00:00:48,000
look something like this

25
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:49,920
right by using our site you agree to our

26
00:00:49,920 --> 00:00:52,879
use of cookies as per our privacy policy

27
00:00:52,879 --> 00:00:55,600
and so this kind of pop-up legally

28
00:00:55,600 --> 00:00:57,760
implies consent if you continue browsing

29
00:00:57,760 --> 00:00:58,480
on

30
00:00:58,480 --> 00:01:01,760
you know the website so we have privacy

31
00:01:01,760 --> 00:01:03,120
policies we know that this

32
00:01:03,120 --> 00:01:05,760
is the law right now and since these are

33
00:01:05,760 --> 00:01:07,760
legal contracts we can't just replace

34
00:01:07,760 --> 00:01:09,520
them with pretty pictures

35
00:01:09,520 --> 00:01:11,840
and yet we also know these are tedious

36
00:01:11,840 --> 00:01:13,760
and difficult to read if you read them

37
00:01:13,760 --> 00:01:15,600
but if we need to have them perhaps we

38
00:01:15,600 --> 00:01:16,799
should look at what

39
00:01:16,799 --> 00:01:19,759
the pain points are for these documents

40
00:01:19,759 --> 00:01:20,640
and so

41
00:01:20,640 --> 00:01:22,960
a quick overview of related words as

42
00:01:22,960 --> 00:01:24,400
previously into that

43
00:01:24,400 --> 00:01:26,320
they are long we know that people don't

44
00:01:26,320 --> 00:01:27,600
read these things

45
00:01:27,600 --> 00:01:30,720
and even if you are trying to

46
00:01:30,720 --> 00:01:33,680
read a progressive policy well research

47
00:01:33,680 --> 00:01:35,360
has found that they are often written at

48
00:01:35,360 --> 00:01:36,640
levels that are difficult for the

49
00:01:36,640 --> 00:01:38,720
majority of people to understand

50
00:01:38,720 --> 00:01:40,320
or their linguistically structured in

51
00:01:40,320 --> 00:01:41,920
such a way as to be

52
00:01:41,920 --> 00:01:45,280
difficult to understand so

53
00:01:45,280 --> 00:01:48,240
even if you are at the reading level of

54
00:01:48,240 --> 00:01:49,600
these policies

55
00:01:49,600 --> 00:01:51,759
studies have shown that most people are

56
00:01:51,759 --> 00:01:53,600
still only able to answer around

57
00:01:53,600 --> 00:01:55,680
half of the comprehension questions

58
00:01:55,680 --> 00:01:57,600
regarding these policies

59
00:01:57,600 --> 00:02:00,479
so overall privacy policies are hard to

60
00:02:00,479 --> 00:02:01,439
understand

61
00:02:01,439 --> 00:02:03,680
but why don't people understand them

62
00:02:03,680 --> 00:02:05,119
right

63
00:02:05,119 --> 00:02:07,520
is it the sentences is it rewarding or

64
00:02:07,520 --> 00:02:09,119
is it the specific tradition

65
00:02:09,119 --> 00:02:12,720
right and so in our work we looked at

66
00:02:12,720 --> 00:02:15,280
the technical terms specifically that

67
00:02:15,280 --> 00:02:15,760
appear

68
00:02:15,760 --> 00:02:17,680
in privacy policies rather than the

69
00:02:17,680 --> 00:02:19,920
linguistic and structural features

70
00:02:19,920 --> 00:02:22,560
and so this leads to our broad research

71
00:02:22,560 --> 00:02:23,440
questions

72
00:02:23,440 --> 00:02:26,640
the first of which is whether how well

73
00:02:26,640 --> 00:02:28,560
users understand the technical terms

74
00:02:28,560 --> 00:02:30,480
that appear in practice and policies

75
00:02:30,480 --> 00:02:32,959
and by how well do they understand we

76
00:02:32,959 --> 00:02:34,000
look at whether

77
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:37,120
specific common misconceptions appear

78
00:02:37,120 --> 00:02:40,160
and if there are certain misconceptions

79
00:02:40,160 --> 00:02:42,080
and misunderstandings of these terms

80
00:02:42,080 --> 00:02:44,319
well how does that affect users comfort

81
00:02:44,319 --> 00:02:46,319
with the privacy policies that use these

82
00:02:46,319 --> 00:02:47,200
terms

83
00:02:47,200 --> 00:02:49,599
and to follow up on that well how does

84
00:02:49,599 --> 00:02:52,160
it affect users self-reported acceptance

85
00:02:52,160 --> 00:02:54,239
of privacy policies how likely did they

86
00:02:54,239 --> 00:02:57,120
say they are to accept these policies

87
00:02:57,120 --> 00:03:00,080
and how do we go about this so i'll give

88
00:03:00,080 --> 00:03:00,480
you

89
00:03:00,480 --> 00:03:03,200
a brief overview of our methodology

90
00:03:03,200 --> 00:03:04,000
before going into

91
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:06,959
details on each of the steps so since

92
00:03:06,959 --> 00:03:08,800
we're looking at privacy policies

93
00:03:08,800 --> 00:03:11,519
we had to read and analyze them so we

94
00:03:11,519 --> 00:03:12,159
did that

95
00:03:12,159 --> 00:03:14,239
and ended we read a bunch of privacy

96
00:03:14,239 --> 00:03:15,760
policies and

97
00:03:15,760 --> 00:03:18,800
um extracted a set of 57 initial

98
00:03:18,800 --> 00:03:21,360
technical terms of interest

99
00:03:21,360 --> 00:03:23,760
and from using these terms we ran a

100
00:03:23,760 --> 00:03:25,920
qualitative pilot of 80 people

101
00:03:25,920 --> 00:03:28,959
on amazon mechanical turk so our m turk

102
00:03:28,959 --> 00:03:29,599
workers

103
00:03:29,599 --> 00:03:32,000
were always located in the united states

104
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:32,640
and had

105
00:03:32,640 --> 00:03:36,159
a 95 plus acceptance rate

106
00:03:36,159 --> 00:03:38,239
from the political pilot where which we

107
00:03:38,239 --> 00:03:39,519
used to look at

108
00:03:39,519 --> 00:03:41,680
which terms were commonly misunderstood

109
00:03:41,680 --> 00:03:47,040
we ended up with a final set of 22 terms

110
00:03:47,040 --> 00:03:49,040
and so these are the 22 terms we used

111
00:03:49,040 --> 00:03:50,319
for our main study

112
00:03:50,319 --> 00:03:54,799
of 800 users on amazon culture and so

113
00:03:54,799 --> 00:03:57,200
the main study looked at our two main

114
00:03:57,200 --> 00:03:59,280
lines of inquiry so definitions which

115
00:03:59,280 --> 00:04:01,840
looked at which misconceptions existed

116
00:04:01,840 --> 00:04:04,239
and how commonly as well as comfort

117
00:04:04,239 --> 00:04:04,959
levels

118
00:04:04,959 --> 00:04:08,239
so how comfortable would people be given

119
00:04:08,239 --> 00:04:10,480
that there might be misconceptions of

120
00:04:10,480 --> 00:04:12,000
these terms

121
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:15,599
and we had also a follow-up study of 108

122
00:04:15,599 --> 00:04:16,399
users

123
00:04:16,399 --> 00:04:20,320
and this asked about their self-reported

124
00:04:20,320 --> 00:04:22,960
um acceptance likelihood of policies

125
00:04:22,960 --> 00:04:24,320
that

126
00:04:24,320 --> 00:04:27,600
will respond and so

127
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:29,040
let's go into more detail about the

128
00:04:29,040 --> 00:04:30,639
privacy policy analysis and how it got

129
00:04:30,639 --> 00:04:32,160
our turns

130
00:04:32,160 --> 00:04:35,440
we read the privacy policies

131
00:04:35,440 --> 00:04:37,680
of the top 10 english language sites

132
00:04:37,680 --> 00:04:39,280
from alexa.com

133
00:04:39,280 --> 00:04:43,040
and from there we identified 57 terms of

134
00:04:43,040 --> 00:04:44,479
interest

135
00:04:44,479 --> 00:04:47,759
so these 57 terms were validated with an

136
00:04:47,759 --> 00:04:50,639
automated analysis of over 3600

137
00:04:50,639 --> 00:04:53,759
english language privacy policies and so

138
00:04:53,759 --> 00:04:56,880
all terms that appeared in our corpus

139
00:04:56,880 --> 00:04:59,600
over 500 times also appeared in our

140
00:04:59,600 --> 00:05:01,039
pilot study

141
00:05:01,039 --> 00:05:03,919
and so now that we have these terms it

142
00:05:03,919 --> 00:05:06,080
was time to run our pilot study

143
00:05:06,080 --> 00:05:07,840
and our first line of inquiry so our

144
00:05:07,840 --> 00:05:09,280
first research question was on

145
00:05:09,280 --> 00:05:10,560
misconceptions

146
00:05:10,560 --> 00:05:12,160
and whether users knew the meaning or

147
00:05:12,160 --> 00:05:14,880
general meaning of these terms

148
00:05:14,880 --> 00:05:18,560
so how we did this in our post study was

149
00:05:18,560 --> 00:05:21,199
let's take one of our terms pixel tag as

150
00:05:21,199 --> 00:05:22,320
an example

151
00:05:22,320 --> 00:05:25,120
right we gave an example sentence for

152
00:05:25,120 --> 00:05:26,479
pixel tag

153
00:05:26,479 --> 00:05:29,520
and we asked users to define

154
00:05:29,520 --> 00:05:31,520
in a text box what they thought pixel

155
00:05:31,520 --> 00:05:32,720
tag was

156
00:05:32,720 --> 00:05:34,320
and so we can look at some of the

157
00:05:34,320 --> 00:05:36,880
answers that are responding to scale

158
00:05:36,880 --> 00:05:40,479
and so well okay some people went

159
00:05:40,479 --> 00:05:42,400
pixel tag that's formed with two words

160
00:05:42,400 --> 00:05:44,240
pixel and tag

161
00:05:44,240 --> 00:05:46,240
tag might mean something about

162
00:05:46,240 --> 00:05:47,840
identification

163
00:05:47,840 --> 00:05:50,240
pixels have something to do with

164
00:05:50,240 --> 00:05:51,360
pictures

165
00:05:51,360 --> 00:05:53,840
so one respondent said that pixel tags

166
00:05:53,840 --> 00:05:56,160
were the data that identifies the pixel

167
00:05:56,160 --> 00:05:57,759
information of the photo

168
00:05:57,759 --> 00:06:00,160
which is incorrect but they tried good

169
00:06:00,160 --> 00:06:01,600
for them

170
00:06:01,600 --> 00:06:03,919
others may be focused more on the word

171
00:06:03,919 --> 00:06:05,039
pixel

172
00:06:05,039 --> 00:06:08,240
so maybe they went okay so pixels

173
00:06:08,240 --> 00:06:10,400
that has something to do with images

174
00:06:10,400 --> 00:06:12,000
tags are important

175
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:15,440
um so another response was that pixel

176
00:06:15,440 --> 00:06:16,000
tag

177
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:19,199
is a digital file like picture or video

178
00:06:19,199 --> 00:06:21,199
which is once again still rather

179
00:06:21,199 --> 00:06:22,560
incorrect

180
00:06:22,560 --> 00:06:25,600
others got closer so

181
00:06:25,600 --> 00:06:28,240
we had a response that says pixel tags

182
00:06:28,240 --> 00:06:29,600
are indicators that show

183
00:06:29,600 --> 00:06:31,440
where and when and where the user has

184
00:06:31,440 --> 00:06:32,639
been so

185
00:06:32,639 --> 00:06:34,479
this respondent seems to have known

186
00:06:34,479 --> 00:06:36,400
purpose of pixel tags but maybe wasn't

187
00:06:36,400 --> 00:06:38,240
very clear on the exact mechanism by

188
00:06:38,240 --> 00:06:39,360
which they work

189
00:06:39,360 --> 00:06:42,160
but not bad actually and still others

190
00:06:42,160 --> 00:06:43,280
went

191
00:06:43,280 --> 00:06:46,639
okay pixel tag i know what each of these

192
00:06:46,639 --> 00:06:47,360
words mean

193
00:06:47,360 --> 00:06:50,800
separately but you put them together

194
00:06:50,800 --> 00:06:54,080
and i don't know which is again very

195
00:06:54,080 --> 00:06:55,520
valid because

196
00:06:55,520 --> 00:06:57,280
they recognized that they had no idea

197
00:06:57,280 --> 00:06:58,800
what facilitators were

198
00:06:58,800 --> 00:07:01,360
so again this is also very illuminating

199
00:07:01,360 --> 00:07:02,479
response

200
00:07:02,479 --> 00:07:04,800
we did the same for the rest of our 57

201
00:07:04,800 --> 00:07:07,840
terms and asked users to define them

202
00:07:07,840 --> 00:07:11,280
and so from there we ended up from our

203
00:07:11,280 --> 00:07:12,800
57 terms

204
00:07:12,800 --> 00:07:15,280
with a set of 22 terms for our main

205
00:07:15,280 --> 00:07:16,560
study

206
00:07:16,560 --> 00:07:20,400
so these are terms that either were high

207
00:07:20,400 --> 00:07:21,759
frequency so appeared

208
00:07:21,759 --> 00:07:24,960
more than 1000 times in our corpus so

209
00:07:24,960 --> 00:07:28,160
10 high frequency terms along with 10

210
00:07:28,160 --> 00:07:28,880
terms with

211
00:07:28,880 --> 00:07:30,639
significant misunderstandings as

212
00:07:30,639 --> 00:07:33,360
exhibited by the users in our pilot

213
00:07:33,360 --> 00:07:36,000
and we also had free response questions

214
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:36,720
for pii

215
00:07:36,720 --> 00:07:39,120
and personal info to use as our

216
00:07:39,120 --> 00:07:40,880
attention check

217
00:07:40,880 --> 00:07:44,960
so now that we have our 22 final terms

218
00:07:44,960 --> 00:07:47,440
it was time for our main study

219
00:07:47,440 --> 00:07:51,360
and so the main study looked at both

220
00:07:51,360 --> 00:07:53,120
misconceptions which we looked at

221
00:07:53,120 --> 00:07:55,280
through how well people can define it

222
00:07:55,280 --> 00:07:57,199
as well as comfort levels so let's talk

223
00:07:57,199 --> 00:07:59,840
a bit about definitions

224
00:07:59,840 --> 00:08:02,080
so on the right you see a question about

225
00:08:02,080 --> 00:08:04,879
pixel tags drawn from our main study

226
00:08:04,879 --> 00:08:07,840
and so the definition section asks users

227
00:08:07,840 --> 00:08:09,520
to select the correct definitions for

228
00:08:09,520 --> 00:08:11,440
the terms

229
00:08:11,440 --> 00:08:13,840
from out of multiple choice questions so

230
00:08:13,840 --> 00:08:15,199
the correct answer is highlighted in

231
00:08:15,199 --> 00:08:15,919
bold here

232
00:08:15,919 --> 00:08:17,680
and the incorrect answers were drawn

233
00:08:17,680 --> 00:08:19,840
from actual answers users gave in the

234
00:08:19,840 --> 00:08:20,720
pilot

235
00:08:20,720 --> 00:08:22,800
and so in our main study this could

236
00:08:22,800 --> 00:08:25,039
reveal actual misconceptions exhibited

237
00:08:25,039 --> 00:08:26,000
by the users

238
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:27,680
and see if these misconceptions were

239
00:08:27,680 --> 00:08:29,280
commonly held so

240
00:08:29,280 --> 00:08:32,240
how else do people do in our main study

241
00:08:32,240 --> 00:08:34,479
well

242
00:08:35,679 --> 00:08:39,519
29 users said the correct answer is so

243
00:08:39,519 --> 00:08:41,200
good for them

244
00:08:41,200 --> 00:08:44,800
um 20 of users said i don't know

245
00:08:44,800 --> 00:08:47,519
which is also super valid right because

246
00:08:47,519 --> 00:08:48,880
we wanted to give

247
00:08:48,880 --> 00:08:51,920
users that knew they didn't know what

248
00:08:51,920 --> 00:08:54,000
a term meant the option to select that

249
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:55,440
rather than randomly guessing

250
00:08:55,440 --> 00:08:58,080
so we could reduce this and now given

251
00:08:58,080 --> 00:09:00,560
these numbers with some basic arithmetic

252
00:09:00,560 --> 00:09:01,760
you can see that over half of

253
00:09:01,760 --> 00:09:03,600
respondents were

254
00:09:03,600 --> 00:09:06,320
incorrect about what pixel tanks were

255
00:09:06,320 --> 00:09:07,120
and

256
00:09:07,120 --> 00:09:08,959
i also want to point out that they were

257
00:09:08,959 --> 00:09:10,480
not only

258
00:09:10,480 --> 00:09:12,800
incorrect about what the term meant but

259
00:09:12,800 --> 00:09:13,680
they were also

260
00:09:13,680 --> 00:09:15,600
confident enough in their misconception

261
00:09:15,600 --> 00:09:16,959
to choose a wrong answer

262
00:09:16,959 --> 00:09:20,480
over i don't know so 51 that's quite a

263
00:09:20,480 --> 00:09:21,200
lot

264
00:09:21,200 --> 00:09:23,200
but it's not surprising given the

265
00:09:23,200 --> 00:09:25,120
overall accuracy of responses

266
00:09:25,120 --> 00:09:27,680
in our definition questions so here we

267
00:09:27,680 --> 00:09:29,680
have a graph

268
00:09:29,680 --> 00:09:32,800
about the distribution of responses for

269
00:09:32,800 --> 00:09:34,880
each of our definition questions

270
00:09:34,880 --> 00:09:37,680
and so all the terms are on the x-axis

271
00:09:37,680 --> 00:09:39,440
and on the y-axis

272
00:09:39,440 --> 00:09:42,399
um on the bottom you see the percentage

273
00:09:42,399 --> 00:09:43,760
of correct answers

274
00:09:43,760 --> 00:09:47,279
to that question and then the proportion

275
00:09:47,279 --> 00:09:50,320
of answers that exhibited a particular

276
00:09:50,320 --> 00:09:51,600
misconception

277
00:09:51,600 --> 00:09:54,399
um which is marked as incorrect and then

278
00:09:54,399 --> 00:09:54,720
the

279
00:09:54,720 --> 00:09:56,560
percentage of users that said i don't

280
00:09:56,560 --> 00:09:58,560
know so we've already talked about pixel

281
00:09:58,560 --> 00:09:59,279
tags

282
00:09:59,279 --> 00:10:01,600
um let's look beside it metadata how do

283
00:10:01,600 --> 00:10:02,959
we read the script

284
00:10:02,959 --> 00:10:06,320
right so from here we can see that

285
00:10:06,320 --> 00:10:08,880
around half of users chose the correct

286
00:10:08,880 --> 00:10:12,240
definition for metadata good for them

287
00:10:12,240 --> 00:10:15,200
about 40 bit over 40 percent chose an

288
00:10:15,200 --> 00:10:16,800
incorrect answer

289
00:10:16,800 --> 00:10:20,000
and around 10 or a bit less admitted

290
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:22,160
that they didn't know

291
00:10:22,160 --> 00:10:24,320
and so overall across all of our

292
00:10:24,320 --> 00:10:25,760
definitions

293
00:10:25,760 --> 00:10:29,200
um we saw that on average

294
00:10:29,200 --> 00:10:31,279
less than 40 of questions were answered

295
00:10:31,279 --> 00:10:32,959
correctly the user

296
00:10:32,959 --> 00:10:36,240
um over around 11

297
00:10:36,240 --> 00:10:38,640
were answered with i don't know and over

298
00:10:38,640 --> 00:10:40,000
49

299
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:41,360
of definition questions in the full

300
00:10:41,360 --> 00:10:43,839
survey were answered incorrectly

301
00:10:43,839 --> 00:10:46,880
so this shows that overall many

302
00:10:46,880 --> 00:10:48,240
misconceptions exist

303
00:10:48,240 --> 00:10:50,880
right and this leads into our next line

304
00:10:50,880 --> 00:10:51,760
of inquiry

305
00:10:51,760 --> 00:10:53,120
which is about how these

306
00:10:53,120 --> 00:10:54,800
misunderstandings affect users

307
00:10:54,800 --> 00:10:56,399
interaction with and comfort

308
00:10:56,399 --> 00:10:59,680
with privacy policies so in our main

309
00:10:59,680 --> 00:11:00,560
survey

310
00:11:00,560 --> 00:11:02,399
after the pages that asked users to

311
00:11:02,399 --> 00:11:04,399
select the correct definitions of terms

312
00:11:04,399 --> 00:11:06,640
we asked about comfort with policies

313
00:11:06,640 --> 00:11:08,320
including these terms

314
00:11:08,320 --> 00:11:11,120
so each person was shown both a

315
00:11:11,120 --> 00:11:12,240
technical version

316
00:11:12,240 --> 00:11:14,399
so with language extracted from privacy

317
00:11:14,399 --> 00:11:16,880
policies an explanatory version

318
00:11:16,880 --> 00:11:18,800
for half of the terms in random order to

319
00:11:18,800 --> 00:11:20,000
see if there were differences

320
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:21,839
between the technical and explanatory

321
00:11:21,839 --> 00:11:23,680
versions of the same policy

322
00:11:23,680 --> 00:11:26,880
so for example say there were 11 terms

323
00:11:26,880 --> 00:11:28,640
and we had paired technical and

324
00:11:28,640 --> 00:11:29,920
explanatory versions

325
00:11:29,920 --> 00:11:32,079
for these terms there would be 22

326
00:11:32,079 --> 00:11:33,519
questions in total

327
00:11:33,519 --> 00:11:35,600
and the order of all 22 questions would

328
00:11:35,600 --> 00:11:36,640
be randomized

329
00:11:36,640 --> 00:11:38,560
so users would not necessarily see the

330
00:11:38,560 --> 00:11:40,480
technical and the explanatory version of

331
00:11:40,480 --> 00:11:42,240
the same term one after the other

332
00:11:42,240 --> 00:11:43,519
nor would they know that these were

333
00:11:43,519 --> 00:11:46,399
paired so continuing with our pixel tags

334
00:11:46,399 --> 00:11:47,279
example

335
00:11:47,279 --> 00:11:48,959
our technical version of the question

336
00:11:48,959 --> 00:11:51,120
asked how comfortable would you be with

337
00:11:51,120 --> 00:11:52,399
something that says

338
00:11:52,399 --> 00:11:55,200
we use pixel tags to collect information

339
00:11:55,200 --> 00:11:55,600
so

340
00:11:55,600 --> 00:11:57,279
this uses language drawn from

341
00:11:57,279 --> 00:11:59,839
parentheses uh we wrote the explanatory

342
00:11:59,839 --> 00:12:00,320
version

343
00:12:00,320 --> 00:12:02,160
and for pixel tags this says how

344
00:12:02,160 --> 00:12:03,839
comfortable would you be with something

345
00:12:03,839 --> 00:12:04,560
that says

346
00:12:04,560 --> 00:12:06,399
we monitor user behaviors across

347
00:12:06,399 --> 00:12:08,079
different websites using invisible

348
00:12:08,079 --> 00:12:08,560
images

349
00:12:08,560 --> 00:12:11,200
and other website elements and so for

350
00:12:11,200 --> 00:12:12,240
each question

351
00:12:12,240 --> 00:12:14,160
users rated their comfort on a likert

352
00:12:14,160 --> 00:12:16,240
scale from very uncomfortable to very

353
00:12:16,240 --> 00:12:17,760
comfortable

354
00:12:17,760 --> 00:12:20,480
and even though participants did not

355
00:12:20,480 --> 00:12:21,839
know the questions repaired

356
00:12:21,839 --> 00:12:24,800
we did so we looked at the change in

357
00:12:24,800 --> 00:12:26,000
comfort between the technical

358
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:27,920
explanatory conversions

359
00:12:27,920 --> 00:12:30,639
and so this is paired data so we use the

360
00:12:30,639 --> 00:12:31,839
paired t-test

361
00:12:31,839 --> 00:12:33,839
and so for example we could ask for a

362
00:12:33,839 --> 00:12:36,399
pixel tag did comfort generally decrease

363
00:12:36,399 --> 00:12:37,680
when the term was explained

364
00:12:37,680 --> 00:12:40,880
versus when it wasn't and then we could

365
00:12:40,880 --> 00:12:42,800
use our statistical tests to see if

366
00:12:42,800 --> 00:12:44,240
there were general trends

367
00:12:44,240 --> 00:12:47,120
in changes in comfort between terms that

368
00:12:47,120 --> 00:12:47,519
were

369
00:12:47,519 --> 00:12:49,279
left in their typified version compared

370
00:12:49,279 --> 00:12:50,800
with the explanatory version

371
00:12:50,800 --> 00:12:52,480
so we sum this up in a handy chart for

372
00:12:52,480 --> 00:12:53,920
you right

373
00:12:53,920 --> 00:12:56,320
so on the x-axis you see the terms on

374
00:12:56,320 --> 00:12:57,120
the y-axis

375
00:12:57,120 --> 00:13:00,160
the mean change in comfort so

376
00:13:00,160 --> 00:13:02,240
negative values indicate a decrease in

377
00:13:02,240 --> 00:13:03,760
comfort when terms are explained whereas

378
00:13:03,760 --> 00:13:05,680
positive values indicate more comfort in

379
00:13:05,680 --> 00:13:06,880
terms of its length

380
00:13:06,880 --> 00:13:08,240
and of course we didn't expect the same

381
00:13:08,240 --> 00:13:10,639
direction of change for

382
00:13:10,639 --> 00:13:13,680
all of our terms so for metadata

383
00:13:13,680 --> 00:13:15,200
pixel takes web beacons and device

384
00:13:15,200 --> 00:13:17,120
fingerprinting we expected comfort to

385
00:13:17,120 --> 00:13:17,839
decrease

386
00:13:17,839 --> 00:13:20,000
because from our pilot answers it showed

387
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:22,480
that users didn't understand the extent

388
00:13:22,480 --> 00:13:24,160
of data being collected or the actual

389
00:13:24,160 --> 00:13:26,079
behavior of these things

390
00:13:26,079 --> 00:13:28,000
on the other hand for browser storage

391
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:30,079
local storage persistent cookies session

392
00:13:30,079 --> 00:13:30,880
cookies

393
00:13:30,880 --> 00:13:32,880
engine encryption and encryption we

394
00:13:32,880 --> 00:13:34,800
expected an increase in comfort

395
00:13:34,800 --> 00:13:37,519
because what we saw from our pilot was

396
00:13:37,519 --> 00:13:37,920
that

397
00:13:37,920 --> 00:13:41,120
users had misconceptions about the

398
00:13:41,120 --> 00:13:42,560
extent of security and privacy

399
00:13:42,560 --> 00:13:44,800
protections being offered so

400
00:13:44,800 --> 00:13:48,639
what were the actual results for the

401
00:13:48,639 --> 00:13:51,440
uh so the red bars show statistically

402
00:13:51,440 --> 00:13:54,000
significant differences at 0.05 level

403
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:56,560
and so we saw that for the majority of

404
00:13:56,560 --> 00:13:58,720
these comfort did not decrease

405
00:13:58,720 --> 00:14:00,800
right and this makes sense given the

406
00:14:00,800 --> 00:14:03,519
misconceptions we saw with pixel tags

407
00:14:03,519 --> 00:14:06,000
users didn't understand the extent of

408
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:07,519
data being collected or the actual

409
00:14:07,519 --> 00:14:09,440
behavior

410
00:14:09,440 --> 00:14:11,519
as for things we expected comfort to

411
00:14:11,519 --> 00:14:12,720
increase we also saw

412
00:14:12,720 --> 00:14:14,720
some of these increases for example for

413
00:14:14,720 --> 00:14:16,800
local storage and browser storage

414
00:14:16,800 --> 00:14:19,600
uh users mistakenly thought this allowed

415
00:14:19,600 --> 00:14:21,600
their information to be stored on remote

416
00:14:21,600 --> 00:14:22,639
servers under

417
00:14:22,639 --> 00:14:25,839
the control of other principles and so

418
00:14:25,839 --> 00:14:29,120
when it was explained users had a better

419
00:14:29,120 --> 00:14:30,320
understanding of the

420
00:14:30,320 --> 00:14:32,480
actual security and privacy protections

421
00:14:32,480 --> 00:14:34,399
being offered

422
00:14:34,399 --> 00:14:36,480
similar to our comfort questions we also

423
00:14:36,480 --> 00:14:38,079
ran a follow-up study

424
00:14:38,079 --> 00:14:40,639
where in instead of comfort levels we

425
00:14:40,639 --> 00:14:41,120
asked

426
00:14:41,120 --> 00:14:43,839
users how likely they would be to accept

427
00:14:43,839 --> 00:14:45,279
privacy policies

428
00:14:45,279 --> 00:14:47,360
uh using technical versus explanatory

429
00:14:47,360 --> 00:14:49,519
terms and so we saw the same directions

430
00:14:49,519 --> 00:14:50,240
of change

431
00:14:50,240 --> 00:14:52,320
for self-reported acceptance of privacy

432
00:14:52,320 --> 00:14:54,320
policies as we did for comfort

433
00:14:54,320 --> 00:14:57,199
so that means if for a term we saw

434
00:14:57,199 --> 00:14:59,120
higher comfort once it was explained

435
00:14:59,120 --> 00:15:01,760
we also saw that people said they were

436
00:15:01,760 --> 00:15:03,760
more likely to accept a policy

437
00:15:03,760 --> 00:15:06,160
when it was explained and vice versa for

438
00:15:06,160 --> 00:15:07,040
lower comfort

439
00:15:07,040 --> 00:15:10,399
and the acceptance likelihood so

440
00:15:10,399 --> 00:15:13,120
what have we seen well we know that

441
00:15:13,120 --> 00:15:13,680
there are

442
00:15:13,680 --> 00:15:15,839
widespread misconceptions of technical

443
00:15:15,839 --> 00:15:17,360
terms from our study

444
00:15:17,360 --> 00:15:19,040
and we've seen also that these

445
00:15:19,040 --> 00:15:20,880
misconceptions affect the ways in which

446
00:15:20,880 --> 00:15:23,360
users interpret privacy policies

447
00:15:23,360 --> 00:15:25,760
and the protections offered or not

448
00:15:25,760 --> 00:15:26,560
offered

449
00:15:26,560 --> 00:15:30,320
as might be the case so what do we do

450
00:15:30,320 --> 00:15:33,920
what now this kind of legal framework

451
00:15:33,920 --> 00:15:36,240
these blocks of texts these check boxes

452
00:15:36,240 --> 00:15:38,839
these pop-ups

453
00:15:38,839 --> 00:15:42,320
that's need to go away anytime soon

454
00:15:42,320 --> 00:15:45,040
right even though past work is shown

455
00:15:45,040 --> 00:15:46,320
that they are hard to read

456
00:15:46,320 --> 00:15:48,720
they are hard to understand even for the

457
00:15:48,720 --> 00:15:50,800
minority of people whose reading level

458
00:15:50,800 --> 00:15:52,240
matches the level at which they are

459
00:15:52,240 --> 00:15:53,440
written

460
00:15:53,440 --> 00:15:56,639
these are still legal documents right

461
00:15:56,639 --> 00:15:59,160
and they are hard to read because

462
00:15:59,160 --> 00:16:01,519
misunderstandings of specific technical

463
00:16:01,519 --> 00:16:03,360
legal terms which we have explored

464
00:16:03,360 --> 00:16:06,800
here also contribute to this reality of

465
00:16:06,800 --> 00:16:08,880
i there's a lot of words and i don't

466
00:16:08,880 --> 00:16:10,560
know what they mean

467
00:16:10,560 --> 00:16:13,279
so we do understand that keeping these

468
00:16:13,279 --> 00:16:15,040
technical terms and privacy policies is

469
00:16:15,040 --> 00:16:16,320
still likely necessary

470
00:16:16,320 --> 00:16:18,160
because again these are legal documents

471
00:16:18,160 --> 00:16:20,480
so they have legal implications

472
00:16:20,480 --> 00:16:22,079
but we've also shown that people's

473
00:16:22,079 --> 00:16:26,079
relationships to these terms are complex

474
00:16:26,079 --> 00:16:28,399
certainly there are widespread

475
00:16:28,399 --> 00:16:29,199
misconceptions

476
00:16:29,199 --> 00:16:31,040
these terms misunderstandings of these

477
00:16:31,040 --> 00:16:32,639
terms and we see that these

478
00:16:32,639 --> 00:16:33,759
misunderstandings

479
00:16:33,759 --> 00:16:35,680
affect the interpretation of terms and

480
00:16:35,680 --> 00:16:37,199
get the interpretation of these

481
00:16:37,199 --> 00:16:39,920
practical policies and what they do

482
00:16:39,920 --> 00:16:42,000
because for some terms knowing what it

483
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:44,160
means increases your comfort because

484
00:16:44,160 --> 00:16:44,560
then

485
00:16:44,560 --> 00:16:46,399
you understand that protections are

486
00:16:46,399 --> 00:16:48,720
provided or less data is collected than

487
00:16:48,720 --> 00:16:49,680
you assumed

488
00:16:49,680 --> 00:16:51,680
on the other hand for other terms well

489
00:16:51,680 --> 00:16:52,880
knowing more about what they mean

490
00:16:52,880 --> 00:16:54,320
decreases your comfort

491
00:16:54,320 --> 00:16:56,000
because you otherwise might not have

492
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:57,600
recognized the invasiveness or broad

493
00:16:57,600 --> 00:16:58,399
inclusiveness

494
00:16:58,399 --> 00:17:01,759
of what data is being collected or

495
00:17:01,759 --> 00:17:04,160
that this is actually a tracking method

496
00:17:04,160 --> 00:17:05,280
so

497
00:17:05,280 --> 00:17:06,959
this leaves us with concerns that

498
00:17:06,959 --> 00:17:08,959
companies by wording and rewording their

499
00:17:08,959 --> 00:17:11,039
privacy policies and other documents

500
00:17:11,039 --> 00:17:11,599
using

501
00:17:11,599 --> 00:17:14,000
legal technical terms can manipulate

502
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:15,679
users in ways that

503
00:17:15,679 --> 00:17:17,760
you know threaten claims of informed

504
00:17:17,760 --> 00:17:20,559
consent and informed consent underpins

505
00:17:20,559 --> 00:17:22,400
privacy policies and the rest of our

506
00:17:22,400 --> 00:17:23,359
current

507
00:17:23,359 --> 00:17:25,439
privacy regime because is it really

508
00:17:25,439 --> 00:17:27,199
informed consent when users are basing

509
00:17:27,199 --> 00:17:28,960
their choices on misunderstandings of

510
00:17:28,960 --> 00:17:30,000
these terms

511
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:32,559
right incoming laws across the country

512
00:17:32,559 --> 00:17:33,200
in the world

513
00:17:33,200 --> 00:17:36,080
continue to rely on notions of consent

514
00:17:36,080 --> 00:17:37,600
which are underspecified

515
00:17:37,600 --> 00:17:40,240
and research such as this can help us

516
00:17:40,240 --> 00:17:42,000
build towards ensuring that equals and

517
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:44,080
society's true valuation privacy is

518
00:17:44,080 --> 00:17:45,520
better reflected in the ways

519
00:17:45,520 --> 00:17:47,760
that privacy is handled and defined and

520
00:17:47,760 --> 00:17:49,440
so we hope our work is a step in the

521
00:17:49,440 --> 00:17:51,039
direction of being able to pick apart

522
00:17:51,039 --> 00:17:52,799
this complex domain and work towards

523
00:17:52,799 --> 00:17:54,080
such a future

524
00:17:54,080 --> 00:17:57,280
thank you
