00:00:00,960 --> 00:00:02,800
hello my name is lux and it's my

2
00:00:02,800 --> 00:00:04,640
pleasure to introduce crowd notifier we

3
00:00:04,640 --> 00:00:06,000
just joined the work with my awesome

4
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:07,600
collaborators data michael

5
00:00:07,600 --> 00:00:10,719
and marcel kenny

6
00:00:10,719 --> 00:00:13,280
when this pandemic started more than a

7
00:00:13,280 --> 00:00:14,400
year and a half ago

8
00:00:14,400 --> 00:00:15,920
it became very clear that one of the

9
00:00:15,920 --> 00:00:17,680
major transmission factors was when

10
00:00:17,680 --> 00:00:18,320
people were

11
00:00:18,320 --> 00:00:21,039
close by to a coveted positive person

12
00:00:21,039 --> 00:00:23,279
and in particular less than 1.5 meters

13
00:00:23,279 --> 00:00:24,560
and

14
00:00:24,560 --> 00:00:26,480
both the academic and industrial

15
00:00:26,480 --> 00:00:28,720
community developed

16
00:00:28,720 --> 00:00:31,039
very quickly bluetooth-based proximity

17
00:00:31,039 --> 00:00:32,800
apps that would warn people when they

18
00:00:32,800 --> 00:00:35,280
had been closed so that it could take

19
00:00:35,280 --> 00:00:36,960
appropriate precautions such as get

20
00:00:36,960 --> 00:00:38,800
tested or to quarantine

21
00:00:38,800 --> 00:00:41,360
now as the pandemic progressed it turned

22
00:00:41,360 --> 00:00:42,640
out that that was not the only

23
00:00:42,640 --> 00:00:44,719
transmission factor and actually turned

24
00:00:44,719 --> 00:00:46,480
out that in indoor spaces

25
00:00:46,480 --> 00:00:48,719
the virus would in fact people that were

26
00:00:48,719 --> 00:00:50,160
much further away than

27
00:00:50,160 --> 00:00:53,199
than these 1.5 meters and

28
00:00:53,199 --> 00:00:54,559
it is also clear that that

29
00:00:54,559 --> 00:00:56,960
bluetooth-based proximity apps

30
00:00:56,960 --> 00:00:58,879
don't manage to cover these situations

31
00:00:58,879 --> 00:01:00,000
very well because they don't know

32
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:01,680
whether the space is indoor or badly

33
00:01:01,680 --> 00:01:03,199
ventilated so there was a need for

34
00:01:03,199 --> 00:01:04,319
another tool

35
00:01:04,319 --> 00:01:06,720
and this type of tool is what this talk

36
00:01:06,720 --> 00:01:07,600
is about

37
00:01:07,600 --> 00:01:11,040
so after conversing with contact tracing

38
00:01:11,040 --> 00:01:12,960
teams we realized that

39
00:01:12,960 --> 00:01:14,720
that the main purpose of this type of

40
00:01:14,720 --> 00:01:16,159
tool was to notify

41
00:01:16,159 --> 00:01:18,799
everybody that had shared an indoor

42
00:01:18,799 --> 00:01:19,600
space

43
00:01:19,600 --> 00:01:22,479
with the covid positive course and

44
00:01:22,479 --> 00:01:23,680
notice that we're actually

45
00:01:23,680 --> 00:01:24,880
limiting the purpose here to

46
00:01:24,880 --> 00:01:26,799
notification because it turns out that

47
00:01:26,799 --> 00:01:27,840
even though

48
00:01:27,840 --> 00:01:30,880
many contact tracing teams and and laws

49
00:01:30,880 --> 00:01:33,600
mandate collecting much more information

50
00:01:33,600 --> 00:01:34,560
the primary

51
00:01:34,560 --> 00:01:36,640
use that this information has is then to

52
00:01:36,640 --> 00:01:37,600
call people

53
00:01:37,600 --> 00:01:39,600
and to notify them so we decided to

54
00:01:39,600 --> 00:01:41,920
limit the purpose to notification only

55
00:01:41,920 --> 00:01:45,360
thereby and in addition by by developing

56
00:01:45,360 --> 00:01:47,200
a system with strong privacy guarantees

57
00:01:47,200 --> 00:01:47,840
hoping to

58
00:01:47,840 --> 00:01:50,000
increase adoption thereby having the

59
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:52,479
best public health benefits possible

60
00:01:52,479 --> 00:01:54,720
now by building a system that notifies

61
00:01:54,720 --> 00:01:56,399
people automatically

62
00:01:56,399 --> 00:01:59,920
um that would also drastically reduce

63
00:01:59,920 --> 00:02:02,000
the load on manual contact tracing teams

64
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:02,880
that have had

65
00:02:02,880 --> 00:02:04,640
several points during this pandemic have

66
00:02:04,640 --> 00:02:06,640
been completely overwhelmed

67
00:02:06,640 --> 00:02:08,318
and then even in times when they're not

68
00:02:08,318 --> 00:02:10,080
overwhelmed it just takes a lot of time

69
00:02:10,080 --> 00:02:12,400
to call people so

70
00:02:12,400 --> 00:02:14,400
the hope is that having a digital system

71
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:16,640
would also

72
00:02:16,640 --> 00:02:19,680
encourage much faster notification

73
00:02:19,680 --> 00:02:21,120
now building these systems is not

74
00:02:21,120 --> 00:02:22,959
without risks and i'm showing here

75
00:02:22,959 --> 00:02:25,440
a couple of risks based on different

76
00:02:25,440 --> 00:02:27,200
newspaper articles

77
00:02:27,200 --> 00:02:30,160
and the first of those seen here on the

78
00:02:30,160 --> 00:02:32,160
right is that data collected for the

79
00:02:32,160 --> 00:02:33,840
purpose of this type of contact tracing

80
00:02:33,840 --> 00:02:35,519
at restaurants and bars

81
00:02:35,519 --> 00:02:37,599
has been used several times already for

82
00:02:37,599 --> 00:02:38,959
different purposes namely either

83
00:02:38,959 --> 00:02:40,640
commercial purposes or stalking or

84
00:02:40,640 --> 00:02:42,720
harassment of women

85
00:02:42,720 --> 00:02:44,879
now a little bit further to the left

86
00:02:44,879 --> 00:02:46,560
both at the top and at the bottom you

87
00:02:46,560 --> 00:02:47,840
see cases where

88
00:02:47,840 --> 00:02:49,599
data collected for contact tracing

89
00:02:49,599 --> 00:02:51,680
purposes is it used by

90
00:02:51,680 --> 00:02:54,959
used or rather abused by

91
00:02:54,959 --> 00:02:57,840
law enforcement for clearly non-public

92
00:02:57,840 --> 00:02:59,760
health related benefits but rather

93
00:02:59,760 --> 00:03:02,959
identifying witnesses or victims of

94
00:03:02,959 --> 00:03:04,720
perpetrators of crime

95
00:03:04,720 --> 00:03:07,599
um both in germany and north korea and

96
00:03:07,599 --> 00:03:09,280
you see in these cases that

97
00:03:09,280 --> 00:03:12,720
both data collected at locations as data

98
00:03:12,720 --> 00:03:15,200
collected centrally might be

99
00:03:15,200 --> 00:03:18,319
suspect to these and then finally

100
00:03:18,319 --> 00:03:21,760
even though this case is not specific to

101
00:03:21,760 --> 00:03:23,360
contact tracing apps

102
00:03:23,360 --> 00:03:26,319
we have seen that any data available on

103
00:03:26,319 --> 00:03:28,159
smartphones might

104
00:03:28,159 --> 00:03:32,000
might enable domestic abusers and

105
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:34,080
partners to to increase their coercive

106
00:03:34,080 --> 00:03:35,040
control

107
00:03:35,040 --> 00:03:36,560
and so therefore we need to be very

108
00:03:36,560 --> 00:03:38,879
careful when deploying systems like this

109
00:03:38,879 --> 00:03:41,360
at such a large scale to mitigate these

110
00:03:41,360 --> 00:03:43,840
privacy concerns as best as possible

111
00:03:43,840 --> 00:03:46,159
now also and even in many of these

112
00:03:46,159 --> 00:03:48,239
examples on the slides

113
00:03:48,239 --> 00:03:49,760
the types of locations that we're

114
00:03:49,760 --> 00:03:51,760
talking about are bars and restaurants

115
00:03:51,760 --> 00:03:53,280
but these are definitely not the only

116
00:03:53,280 --> 00:03:53,920
ones and

117
00:03:53,920 --> 00:03:55,680
and i've put here a couple of on this

118
00:03:55,680 --> 00:03:57,360
slide to to

119
00:03:57,360 --> 00:04:00,080
to illustrate that the sensitivity of

120
00:04:00,080 --> 00:04:01,840
these locations can be much higher for

121
00:04:01,840 --> 00:04:03,599
example when this is a place of worship

122
00:04:03,599 --> 00:04:04,159
or

123
00:04:04,159 --> 00:04:06,319
a community center that is then used for

124
00:04:06,319 --> 00:04:08,319
let's say a political meeting or some

125
00:04:08,319 --> 00:04:10,959
kind of activist meeting or maybe

126
00:04:10,959 --> 00:04:14,480
um some kind of support group and so all

127
00:04:14,480 --> 00:04:15,439
of this

128
00:04:15,439 --> 00:04:18,478
led us to come up with the wide variety

129
00:04:18,478 --> 00:04:20,399
of requirements and then i realized this

130
00:04:20,399 --> 00:04:22,479
is a bit of a busy slide so let me just

131
00:04:22,479 --> 00:04:24,240
walk you through it one by one

132
00:04:24,240 --> 00:04:26,639
so first of all on the top left we

133
00:04:26,639 --> 00:04:29,120
wanted to ensure that the system that we

134
00:04:29,120 --> 00:04:30,800
built would ensure

135
00:04:30,800 --> 00:04:33,600
that generating false notifications is

136
00:04:33,600 --> 00:04:35,520
difficult and this is important

137
00:04:35,520 --> 00:04:38,240
both when a notification means that you

138
00:04:38,240 --> 00:04:40,320
have to quarantine because quarantine

139
00:04:40,320 --> 00:04:42,560
includes work for 10 days is a

140
00:04:42,560 --> 00:04:46,080
very very impactful event but even when

141
00:04:46,080 --> 00:04:48,160
the notification message just urges

142
00:04:48,160 --> 00:04:50,080
people to get tested that induces a lot

143
00:04:50,080 --> 00:04:51,680
of stress so it is important to build

144
00:04:51,680 --> 00:04:52,720
systems that

145
00:04:52,720 --> 00:04:54,960
make it actually difficult to generate

146
00:04:54,960 --> 00:04:56,400
false notifications

147
00:04:56,400 --> 00:04:57,840
but in most of this talk i'll be

148
00:04:57,840 --> 00:05:00,160
focusing on on the privacy properties

149
00:05:00,160 --> 00:05:01,360
and

150
00:05:01,360 --> 00:05:03,600
if you if you look with me at the top

151
00:05:03,600 --> 00:05:05,600
left with respect to users we have seen

152
00:05:05,600 --> 00:05:07,360
in the previous examples that we need to

153
00:05:07,360 --> 00:05:09,280
protect privacy of visits both from

154
00:05:09,280 --> 00:05:12,000
central servers from the locations that

155
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:13,039
people visit

156
00:05:13,039 --> 00:05:15,840
but also protect the data that is stored

157
00:05:15,840 --> 00:05:16,560
on phones

158
00:05:16,560 --> 00:05:18,720
so that we can protect against law

159
00:05:18,720 --> 00:05:20,320
enforcement agencies or intimate

160
00:05:20,320 --> 00:05:21,759
partners that get access to these

161
00:05:21,759 --> 00:05:23,039
defenses

162
00:05:23,039 --> 00:05:26,080
now with respect to locations

163
00:05:26,080 --> 00:05:29,199
uh it is clear that uh

164
00:05:29,199 --> 00:05:30,960
especially in in the more sensitive

165
00:05:30,960 --> 00:05:33,680
locations

166
00:05:34,160 --> 00:05:36,800
knowing that people at this location

167
00:05:36,800 --> 00:05:37,520
have been

168
00:05:37,520 --> 00:05:42,160
notified it can be very stigmatizing

169
00:05:42,160 --> 00:05:44,080
so it is important to protect the

170
00:05:44,080 --> 00:05:47,039
privacy of notified locations and then

171
00:05:47,039 --> 00:05:48,560
also as you noticed on the previous

172
00:05:48,560 --> 00:05:50,639
slide many of these locations and events

173
00:05:50,639 --> 00:05:51,919
that happen

174
00:05:51,919 --> 00:05:54,000
are actually not necessarily in a public

175
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:55,360
database in the way that bars and

176
00:05:55,360 --> 00:05:56,880
restaurants are and

177
00:05:56,880 --> 00:05:59,440
forcing the creation of such a database

178
00:05:59,440 --> 00:06:01,120
in order to facilitate the functioning

179
00:06:01,120 --> 00:06:02,240
of the system

180
00:06:02,240 --> 00:06:04,160
is something that that we believe is is

181
00:06:04,160 --> 00:06:05,600
very undesirable

182
00:06:05,600 --> 00:06:07,600
now of course all of these security and

183
00:06:07,600 --> 00:06:09,199
privacy requirements

184
00:06:09,199 --> 00:06:12,560
constrain the design space but at the

185
00:06:12,560 --> 00:06:13,520
same time

186
00:06:13,520 --> 00:06:18,319
our goal is to to design a system that

187
00:06:18,319 --> 00:06:20,319
that is usable for users right so it

188
00:06:20,319 --> 00:06:21,360
requires a

189
00:06:21,360 --> 00:06:23,680
not a lot of effort is runs on a lot of

190
00:06:23,680 --> 00:06:25,600
smartphones and doesn't require special

191
00:06:25,600 --> 00:06:27,680
permissions like gps and location

192
00:06:27,680 --> 00:06:30,000
access that that that people find very

193
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:31,360
disturbed

194
00:06:31,360 --> 00:06:33,840
and at the same time for locations it is

195
00:06:33,840 --> 00:06:35,600
very difficult to

196
00:06:35,600 --> 00:06:38,400
to require locations to deploy special

197
00:06:38,400 --> 00:06:39,919
software and hardware so we wanted to

198
00:06:39,919 --> 00:06:42,000
make it as easy as possible to do

199
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:43,600
and then finally from our conversations

200
00:06:43,600 --> 00:06:45,199
with public health authorities it became

201
00:06:45,199 --> 00:06:46,240
clear that

202
00:06:46,240 --> 00:06:47,919
it is important for them to stay in the

203
00:06:47,919 --> 00:06:50,160
loop so that they can determine

204
00:06:50,160 --> 00:06:53,919
which locations are at high risk so

205
00:06:53,919 --> 00:06:54,639
therefore

206
00:06:54,639 --> 00:06:56,639
people should be notified let's say not

207
00:06:56,639 --> 00:06:58,400
a lot of ventilation a lot of people a

208
00:06:58,400 --> 00:07:00,160
lot of mingling versus

209
00:07:00,160 --> 00:07:02,400
places where none of these things are

210
00:07:02,400 --> 00:07:03,919
the case in which case maybe it's not

211
00:07:03,919 --> 00:07:05,840
even necessary to send a notification

212
00:07:05,840 --> 00:07:07,440
and then finally to do that in such a

213
00:07:07,440 --> 00:07:08,160
way

214
00:07:08,160 --> 00:07:11,759
that would scale um even when

215
00:07:11,759 --> 00:07:13,759
contact tracing teams are under the live

216
00:07:13,759 --> 00:07:15,199
question now

217
00:07:15,199 --> 00:07:17,440
in order to to design these systems we

218
00:07:17,440 --> 00:07:19,120
came up with a couple of initial design

219
00:07:19,120 --> 00:07:20,319
choices now first of all like

220
00:07:20,319 --> 00:07:20,960
essentially

221
00:07:20,960 --> 00:07:22,880
any other system in the world that does

222
00:07:22,880 --> 00:07:25,759
this we opted to use static qr codes

223
00:07:25,759 --> 00:07:28,000
that are posted by location owners on

224
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:29,680
tables on entry doors

225
00:07:29,680 --> 00:07:32,000
that visit us with scan but we added a

226
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:33,680
little caveat here that the location

227
00:07:33,680 --> 00:07:35,360
owners would generate these qr codes

228
00:07:35,360 --> 00:07:38,160
locally rather than fire snf

229
00:07:38,160 --> 00:07:40,800
and then users would somehow scan these

230
00:07:40,800 --> 00:07:42,880
qr codes with their phone and store a

231
00:07:42,880 --> 00:07:43,680
record

232
00:07:43,680 --> 00:07:45,280
and as we later see this actually is an

233
00:07:45,280 --> 00:07:47,599
encrypted record on their phone

234
00:07:47,599 --> 00:07:50,400
and then finally phones will regularly

235
00:07:50,400 --> 00:07:52,080
download information from

236
00:07:52,080 --> 00:07:53,840
from a central server to locally

237
00:07:53,840 --> 00:07:55,599
determine whether there is a match and

238
00:07:55,599 --> 00:07:56,960
then notify the user

239
00:07:56,960 --> 00:07:59,120
but at no point they will share any of

240
00:07:59,120 --> 00:08:00,560
the information that is stored on the

241
00:08:00,560 --> 00:08:02,560
phone with anybody or share anything in

242
00:08:02,560 --> 00:08:04,319
case there is a notification so this

243
00:08:04,319 --> 00:08:04,800
will

244
00:08:04,800 --> 00:08:07,280
really drastically limit the attack

245
00:08:07,280 --> 00:08:08,800
service available with respect to

246
00:08:08,800 --> 00:08:10,879
violating the privacy of the user

247
00:08:10,879 --> 00:08:12,479
and then as we said before right we're

248
00:08:12,479 --> 00:08:14,400
not we don't want to build a system that

249
00:08:14,400 --> 00:08:15,199
helps with

250
00:08:15,199 --> 00:08:16,879
enforcement of quarantines or

251
00:08:16,879 --> 00:08:18,560
enforcement of physical limits

252
00:08:18,560 --> 00:08:20,400
now already by making these design

253
00:08:20,400 --> 00:08:21,919
choices we

254
00:08:21,919 --> 00:08:24,240
achieve quite a few of the properties

255
00:08:24,240 --> 00:08:26,160
that we set out to achieve so first of

256
00:08:26,160 --> 00:08:27,680
all with respect to user privacy right

257
00:08:27,680 --> 00:08:29,199
there is no information on the central

258
00:08:29,199 --> 00:08:30,560
server or at any

259
00:08:30,560 --> 00:08:32,159
of the locations because everything is

260
00:08:32,159 --> 00:08:33,839
stored on the phone so

261
00:08:33,839 --> 00:08:35,679
the first two are checked off and then

262
00:08:35,679 --> 00:08:37,760
because locations generate qr codes

263
00:08:37,760 --> 00:08:38,479
locally

264
00:08:38,479 --> 00:08:40,320
there is no need for a database of

265
00:08:40,320 --> 00:08:42,000
running

266
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:44,399
and then because scanning qr codes with

267
00:08:44,399 --> 00:08:46,800
an app is a relatively

268
00:08:46,800 --> 00:08:49,040
known well-known paradigm to users this

269
00:08:49,040 --> 00:08:51,360
is we deem this to be pretty easy to use

270
00:08:51,360 --> 00:08:52,880
and it doesn't require any special

271
00:08:52,880 --> 00:08:54,080
permission except for

272
00:08:54,080 --> 00:08:56,320
for camera access which seems a

273
00:08:56,320 --> 00:08:57,839
reasonable thing to do

274
00:08:57,839 --> 00:09:00,240
and then posting a qr code that you

275
00:09:00,240 --> 00:09:01,120
print from

276
00:09:01,120 --> 00:09:03,519
from your browser or whatever does

277
00:09:03,519 --> 00:09:04,959
indeed not require any

278
00:09:04,959 --> 00:09:07,680
additional hardware software so that's

279
00:09:07,680 --> 00:09:08,480
good

280
00:09:08,480 --> 00:09:10,640
but now let's let's zoom into a little

281
00:09:10,640 --> 00:09:12,560
bit these these remaining requirements

282
00:09:12,560 --> 00:09:14,399
in particular the first one

283
00:09:14,399 --> 00:09:17,040
of the user ones what about the phone so

284
00:09:17,040 --> 00:09:18,560
here we consider an attacker that

285
00:09:18,560 --> 00:09:19,040
actually

286
00:09:19,040 --> 00:09:21,120
has access to the static qr codes that

287
00:09:21,120 --> 00:09:22,240
location post

288
00:09:22,240 --> 00:09:24,640
because this attacker might come around

289
00:09:24,640 --> 00:09:26,640
later visit that location in order to do

290
00:09:26,640 --> 00:09:27,760
a confirmation attack

291
00:09:27,760 --> 00:09:31,200
for example now in the case of

292
00:09:31,200 --> 00:09:33,279
notified locations we actually blew out

293
00:09:33,279 --> 00:09:34,640
this attack

294
00:09:34,640 --> 00:09:36,480
and this is not because we want to be

295
00:09:36,480 --> 00:09:38,080
infestatious right but

296
00:09:38,080 --> 00:09:39,760
if you think about what is the purpose

297
00:09:39,760 --> 00:09:41,760
of these systems the purpose of these

298
00:09:41,760 --> 00:09:43,600
systems is that once you scan this qr

299
00:09:43,600 --> 00:09:44,080
code

300
00:09:44,080 --> 00:09:46,399
you will be notified now because the qr

301
00:09:46,399 --> 00:09:48,399
codes in our case are static to

302
00:09:48,399 --> 00:09:50,640
to facilitate usability obviously an

303
00:09:50,640 --> 00:09:52,480
attacker that at some point obtains this

304
00:09:52,480 --> 00:09:55,440
qr code can always check themselves in

305
00:09:55,440 --> 00:09:57,920
and then determine whether our location

306
00:09:57,920 --> 00:09:59,680
has been notified just based on the fact

307
00:09:59,680 --> 00:10:00,320
whether

308
00:10:00,320 --> 00:10:03,360
that attacker herself gets notified

309
00:10:03,360 --> 00:10:06,399
okay so this is a thing

310
00:10:06,399 --> 00:10:09,360
now all the other properties that i

311
00:10:09,360 --> 00:10:10,880
didn't get market screen

312
00:10:10,880 --> 00:10:12,720
need to come from the specific design of

313
00:10:12,720 --> 00:10:14,160
the system so let's look at how this

314
00:10:14,160 --> 00:10:15,920
system actually works

315
00:10:15,920 --> 00:10:18,079
so during a setup phase and this is the

316
00:10:18,079 --> 00:10:19,120
one time event

317
00:10:19,120 --> 00:10:21,760
a location owner will will use let's say

318
00:10:21,760 --> 00:10:24,000
a javascript website to generate two qr

319
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:24,800
codes

320
00:10:24,800 --> 00:10:27,440
the first part of the first qr code will

321
00:10:27,440 --> 00:10:29,279
be the entry code that is public

322
00:10:29,279 --> 00:10:31,120
that will be posted at entrances or

323
00:10:31,120 --> 00:10:32,399
tables and

324
00:10:32,399 --> 00:10:34,880
this qr code will contain first the

325
00:10:34,880 --> 00:10:36,399
description of the venue

326
00:10:36,399 --> 00:10:38,160
name and location a couple of

327
00:10:38,160 --> 00:10:39,440
cryptographic nonces

328
00:10:39,440 --> 00:10:42,160
and most importantly a master public key

329
00:10:42,160 --> 00:10:44,399
for an iot based encryption screen

330
00:10:44,399 --> 00:10:46,320
and this master public key is different

331
00:10:46,320 --> 00:10:48,240
for every location

332
00:10:48,240 --> 00:10:51,120
okay so the location owner acts as the

333
00:10:51,120 --> 00:10:52,160
trusted party

334
00:10:52,160 --> 00:10:54,079
for this particular identity based

335
00:10:54,079 --> 00:10:55,279
encryption scheme

336
00:10:55,279 --> 00:10:57,360
and then the location owner also

337
00:10:57,360 --> 00:10:59,440
generates the corresponding tracing code

338
00:10:59,440 --> 00:11:01,760
which is a private qr code

339
00:11:01,760 --> 00:11:03,920
that guess what contains the

340
00:11:03,920 --> 00:11:05,600
corresponding master support key and

341
00:11:05,600 --> 00:11:07,040
this tracing code will just

342
00:11:07,040 --> 00:11:10,399
recap at the secure location okay

343
00:11:10,399 --> 00:11:12,720
now when the user visits the location

344
00:11:12,720 --> 00:11:14,959
they will scan this qr code

345
00:11:14,959 --> 00:11:17,279
and then their app will show a

346
00:11:17,279 --> 00:11:18,880
description of the location and ask the

347
00:11:18,880 --> 00:11:20,079
user how do you want to

348
00:11:20,079 --> 00:11:23,120
check into the pet's breakout room and

349
00:11:23,120 --> 00:11:24,320
then they use

350
00:11:24,320 --> 00:11:27,120
yeah that sounds like a good thing to do

351
00:11:27,120 --> 00:11:28,880
then at some point later in time the

352
00:11:28,880 --> 00:11:30,160
user will decide okay

353
00:11:30,160 --> 00:11:33,279
i am done with that's breakouting and

354
00:11:33,279 --> 00:11:35,680
enter in their app okay i'm leaving now

355
00:11:35,680 --> 00:11:36,880
and then at that point

356
00:11:36,880 --> 00:11:39,279
the app will create an encrypted record

357
00:11:39,279 --> 00:11:40,800
or rather a set of

358
00:11:40,800 --> 00:11:43,600
cyber texts that capture this specific

359
00:11:43,600 --> 00:11:44,560
visit

360
00:11:44,560 --> 00:11:46,720
and the way it works cryptographically

361
00:11:46,720 --> 00:11:47,600
is that

362
00:11:47,600 --> 00:11:49,680
for every time slot that overlaps with

363
00:11:49,680 --> 00:11:51,600
the user's visit so we typically use

364
00:11:51,600 --> 00:11:52,560
hours but

365
00:11:52,560 --> 00:11:55,519
it doesn't really matter the phone will

366
00:11:55,519 --> 00:11:56,079
compute

367
00:11:56,079 --> 00:11:59,440
a time and venue specific identity

368
00:11:59,440 --> 00:12:01,680
and you don't necessarily need to parse

369
00:12:01,680 --> 00:12:03,279
this complex expression with hash

370
00:12:03,279 --> 00:12:04,320
functions

371
00:12:04,320 --> 00:12:06,399
uh but just notice that it contains the

372
00:12:06,399 --> 00:12:08,079
information of the venue

373
00:12:08,079 --> 00:12:10,160
a counter that indicates the time slot

374
00:12:10,160 --> 00:12:11,760
and a couple of nonsense to make sure

375
00:12:11,760 --> 00:12:12,720
that this cannot be

376
00:12:12,720 --> 00:12:14,880
enforced and then once the phone has

377
00:12:14,880 --> 00:12:16,240
completed this identity

378
00:12:16,240 --> 00:12:17,920
it will take the master public key from

379
00:12:17,920 --> 00:12:19,839
the qr code the identity

380
00:12:19,839 --> 00:12:22,000
and will encrypt the entry and departure

381
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:25,040
times and then stores this cipher text

382
00:12:25,040 --> 00:12:27,600
only so no other information except for

383
00:12:27,600 --> 00:12:29,040
a bunch of cyber texts is stored for

384
00:12:29,040 --> 00:12:29,839
each visit

385
00:12:29,839 --> 00:12:31,680
now these data stay on the phone and are

386
00:12:31,680 --> 00:12:33,519
not shared then

387
00:12:33,519 --> 00:12:36,639
now in order to facilitate tracing first

388
00:12:36,639 --> 00:12:39,760
of all health authorities will

389
00:12:39,760 --> 00:12:43,519
do as they always do interview the index

390
00:12:43,519 --> 00:12:44,079
case and

391
00:12:44,079 --> 00:12:45,920
the person that was positive and ask

392
00:12:45,920 --> 00:12:48,320
okay who have you been in contact with

393
00:12:48,320 --> 00:12:50,320
and where have you been and they use

394
00:12:50,320 --> 00:12:51,519
this information

395
00:12:51,519 --> 00:12:53,680
to determine which locations they would

396
00:12:53,680 --> 00:12:56,000
like to send notifications to

397
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:58,000
or rather to their visitors once they

398
00:12:58,000 --> 00:12:59,279
have determined this the health

399
00:12:59,279 --> 00:13:00,959
authorities will contact the location

400
00:13:00,959 --> 00:13:02,079
owners and say

401
00:13:02,079 --> 00:13:04,079
okay we need this trace of information

402
00:13:04,079 --> 00:13:06,399
from you the location owner will then

403
00:13:06,399 --> 00:13:08,160
use their phone or another device to

404
00:13:08,160 --> 00:13:09,839
scan the chosen qr code

405
00:13:09,839 --> 00:13:12,000
and upload time slot specific tracing

406
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:13,600
information that corresponds to the time

407
00:13:13,600 --> 00:13:15,040
slots that we actually need to send

408
00:13:15,040 --> 00:13:16,399
notifications for

409
00:13:16,399 --> 00:13:17,760
and guess what what is this

410
00:13:17,760 --> 00:13:19,839
time-specific choice of information

411
00:13:19,839 --> 00:13:22,399
these are the identity based decryption

412
00:13:22,399 --> 00:13:24,160
keys that correspond to these specific

413
00:13:24,160 --> 00:13:24,560
types

414
00:13:24,560 --> 00:13:26,800
so what does the location owner's device

415
00:13:26,800 --> 00:13:29,360
do it will recompute these identifiers

416
00:13:29,360 --> 00:13:31,279
recompute the decryption keys and then

417
00:13:31,279 --> 00:13:33,040
upload them to

418
00:13:33,040 --> 00:13:35,440
the health authorities back-end server

419
00:13:35,440 --> 00:13:37,120
together with the nonsense and the

420
00:13:37,120 --> 00:13:39,360
description of the location and then

421
00:13:39,360 --> 00:13:41,760
what the health authorities back-end

422
00:13:41,760 --> 00:13:44,320
does is to to take these decrypt them

423
00:13:44,320 --> 00:13:46,480
and check okay this is indeed

424
00:13:46,480 --> 00:13:47,920
corresponding to the location that i

425
00:13:47,920 --> 00:13:49,040
wanted to notify

426
00:13:49,040 --> 00:13:52,560
grades and it will then publish

427
00:13:52,560 --> 00:13:55,680
only the identities uh the

428
00:13:55,680 --> 00:13:57,839
the identity based decryption keys and

429
00:13:57,839 --> 00:13:59,760
the time slot corresponding to the

430
00:13:59,760 --> 00:14:00,800
actual visit

431
00:14:00,800 --> 00:14:03,519
now what does the app do well it takes

432
00:14:03,519 --> 00:14:03,920
the

433
00:14:03,920 --> 00:14:06,000
identities and decryption keys does

434
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:07,120
trial decryption

435
00:14:07,120 --> 00:14:10,079
on the entries that it's stored if

436
00:14:10,079 --> 00:14:12,079
decryption functions now the app has two

437
00:14:12,079 --> 00:14:12,480
things

438
00:14:12,480 --> 00:14:15,680
it has the time slot stamp or the actual

439
00:14:15,680 --> 00:14:16,560
times that

440
00:14:16,560 --> 00:14:18,959
the index case was at this venue it has

441
00:14:18,959 --> 00:14:21,120
the times that the user was at this menu

442
00:14:21,120 --> 00:14:22,560
because that was what was

443
00:14:22,560 --> 00:14:24,240
encrypted in the cyber text it will

444
00:14:24,240 --> 00:14:26,000
compare these and if there is an overlap

445
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:27,920
it will notify

446
00:14:27,920 --> 00:14:30,160
the user that they need to get tested to

447
00:14:30,160 --> 00:14:31,839
point

448
00:14:31,839 --> 00:14:35,120
and you notice that by by only storing

449
00:14:35,120 --> 00:14:38,399
um these these cyber tags that

450
00:14:38,399 --> 00:14:40,720
hints at you would get privacy with

451
00:14:40,720 --> 00:14:42,639
respect to attackers that have access to

452
00:14:42,639 --> 00:14:43,199
the phone

453
00:14:43,199 --> 00:14:45,760
now it turns out that all of these cases

454
00:14:45,760 --> 00:14:47,440
not too surprising

455
00:14:47,440 --> 00:14:49,519
reduce the properties of the underlying

456
00:14:49,519 --> 00:14:51,279
identity based encryption scheme

457
00:14:51,279 --> 00:14:55,040
what is maybe more surprising is that

458
00:14:55,040 --> 00:14:57,279
like a generic identity based encryption

459
00:14:57,279 --> 00:14:58,079
scheme

460
00:14:58,079 --> 00:15:00,560
does not necessarily make this claim

461
00:15:00,560 --> 00:15:01,440
private

462
00:15:01,440 --> 00:15:03,760
in particular with respect to to privacy

463
00:15:03,760 --> 00:15:05,279
of the users with respect to

464
00:15:05,279 --> 00:15:07,600
information stored on the phone we

465
00:15:07,600 --> 00:15:08,880
really need that

466
00:15:08,880 --> 00:15:11,440
the cipher text have identity and trust

467
00:15:11,440 --> 00:15:12,880
authority privacy which is not a

468
00:15:12,880 --> 00:15:13,920
property that all

469
00:15:13,920 --> 00:15:15,760
identity-based encryption schemes has

470
00:15:15,760 --> 00:15:17,680
but the modified bonus fracking scheme

471
00:15:17,680 --> 00:15:18,320
that we use

472
00:15:18,320 --> 00:15:20,959
does now with respect to locations the

473
00:15:20,959 --> 00:15:22,639
same thing applies we need that the

474
00:15:22,639 --> 00:15:24,399
decryption keys

475
00:15:24,399 --> 00:15:27,199
don't reveal too much information about

476
00:15:27,199 --> 00:15:28,079
the location

477
00:15:28,079 --> 00:15:30,079
that is typically also satisfied and

478
00:15:30,079 --> 00:15:31,759
then finally in order to prevent false

479
00:15:31,759 --> 00:15:33,360
notifications we need a measure of

480
00:15:33,360 --> 00:15:34,399
robustness

481
00:15:34,399 --> 00:15:36,639
so that uh decryption will actually

482
00:15:36,639 --> 00:15:38,399
properly fail

483
00:15:38,399 --> 00:15:41,519
when using should not be

484
00:15:41,519 --> 00:15:43,759
so that is as far as privacy is

485
00:15:43,759 --> 00:15:45,040
concerned and then

486
00:15:45,040 --> 00:15:47,680
as a result of this this system set up

487
00:15:47,680 --> 00:15:49,440
public health authorities remain in the

488
00:15:49,440 --> 00:15:51,360
loop and remain able to determine

489
00:15:51,360 --> 00:15:52,639
this is a location that we should

490
00:15:52,639 --> 00:15:55,279
notified this location but we should not

491
00:15:55,279 --> 00:15:57,519
and because that is the only thing they

492
00:15:57,519 --> 00:15:59,839
will do this will still scale reasonably

493
00:15:59,839 --> 00:16:00,480
well

494
00:16:00,480 --> 00:16:03,839
and to notifying many tens of thousand

495
00:16:03,839 --> 00:16:04,800
users

496
00:16:04,800 --> 00:16:06,720
now you might have been wondering ah

497
00:16:06,720 --> 00:16:08,320
okay we need to do identity based

498
00:16:08,320 --> 00:16:10,320
encryptions that requires pairings how

499
00:16:10,320 --> 00:16:11,600
well does this key

500
00:16:11,600 --> 00:16:13,839
so we evaluated this and we evaluated

501
00:16:13,839 --> 00:16:15,120
two different things

502
00:16:15,120 --> 00:16:16,959
so in the first column you'll see an

503
00:16:16,959 --> 00:16:18,639
evaluation that we run in the laptop

504
00:16:18,639 --> 00:16:19,680
essentially to

505
00:16:19,680 --> 00:16:22,720
determine how long do these things take

506
00:16:22,720 --> 00:16:23,279
for

507
00:16:23,279 --> 00:16:25,120
venue owners and for public health

508
00:16:25,120 --> 00:16:26,959
authorities and we wrote this evaluation

509
00:16:26,959 --> 00:16:28,079
in javascript

510
00:16:28,079 --> 00:16:29,759
and you'll see that okay whatever it

511
00:16:29,759 --> 00:16:31,279
doesn't really matter these are tens of

512
00:16:31,279 --> 00:16:33,040
milliseconds in the worst case for an

513
00:16:33,040 --> 00:16:34,720
operation that doesn't happen very often

514
00:16:34,720 --> 00:16:35,199
so

515
00:16:35,199 --> 00:16:38,800
not a problem now for

516
00:16:38,800 --> 00:16:40,800
operations that happen on the phone

517
00:16:40,800 --> 00:16:42,399
creating a record

518
00:16:42,399 --> 00:16:45,279
i.e creating a cyber text again is well

519
00:16:45,279 --> 00:16:47,360
below seven milliseconds doesn't happen

520
00:16:47,360 --> 00:16:49,360
very often

521
00:16:49,360 --> 00:16:52,320
so finally the operation that does

522
00:16:52,320 --> 00:16:53,920
happen very often is this trial

523
00:16:53,920 --> 00:16:55,120
decryption step

524
00:16:55,120 --> 00:16:58,079
and we see here that it differs a little

525
00:16:58,079 --> 00:16:59,519
bit between the first three android

526
00:16:59,519 --> 00:17:02,720
phones and the last two iphones

527
00:17:02,720 --> 00:17:04,640
the newer iphone is much faster than the

528
00:17:04,640 --> 00:17:06,720
other ones but in all cases

529
00:17:06,720 --> 00:17:08,959
timing is below five seconds so we see

530
00:17:08,959 --> 00:17:10,240
that we have reasonable

531
00:17:10,240 --> 00:17:13,520
performance in all of these cases now

532
00:17:13,520 --> 00:17:15,599
just to conclude crowd notifier provides

533
00:17:15,599 --> 00:17:17,280
presence notification of location

534
00:17:17,280 --> 00:17:20,079
visitors with strong privacy properties

535
00:17:20,079 --> 00:17:21,919
because all records are stored encrypted

536
00:17:21,919 --> 00:17:23,439
on the phone and

537
00:17:23,439 --> 00:17:26,640
it limits purpose limitation as well as

538
00:17:26,640 --> 00:17:28,319
provides sunset by design and even

539
00:17:28,319 --> 00:17:29,919
though i didn't talk about this much

540
00:17:29,919 --> 00:17:31,520
there are a ton of proofs of security

541
00:17:31,520 --> 00:17:32,960
and privacy in the paper

542
00:17:32,960 --> 00:17:34,880
now we implemented all of this to show

543
00:17:34,880 --> 00:17:36,960
the feasibility libraries you can find

544
00:17:36,960 --> 00:17:37,760
online

545
00:17:37,760 --> 00:17:39,919
and maybe most interesting of all uh

546
00:17:39,919 --> 00:17:41,919
this system has been deployed into swiss

547
00:17:41,919 --> 00:17:44,080
coverage which is the swiss national

548
00:17:44,080 --> 00:17:45,840
contact racing app is a slightly

549
00:17:45,840 --> 00:17:47,360
simplified version but i'm very happy

550
00:17:47,360 --> 00:17:48,240
about that

551
00:17:48,240 --> 00:17:50,240
um please see the github link if you

552
00:17:50,240 --> 00:17:51,840
want to have more information and i

553
00:17:51,840 --> 00:17:53,520
welcome any questions that you might

554
00:17:53,520 --> 00:17:54,000
have

555
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:59,120
thank you so much
