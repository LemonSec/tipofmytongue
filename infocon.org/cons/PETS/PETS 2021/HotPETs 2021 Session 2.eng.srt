1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,199
okay so um looks like we're

2
00:00:03,199 --> 00:00:06,319
on we're actually one minute late uh to

3
00:00:06,319 --> 00:00:07,520
start the session

4
00:00:07,520 --> 00:00:09,920
so i'll get joel to step up here and

5
00:00:09,920 --> 00:00:11,440
take over the screen share

6
00:00:11,440 --> 00:00:17,920
for me and we'll get going

7
00:00:21,279 --> 00:00:24,560
all right you can see the slides yes we

8
00:00:24,560 --> 00:00:27,039
can see it

9
00:00:27,039 --> 00:00:30,400
all right thank you so um a couple years

10
00:00:30,400 --> 00:00:31,199
ago we

11
00:00:31,199 --> 00:00:33,760
proposed this method to find apps that

12
00:00:33,760 --> 00:00:34,559
were using

13
00:00:34,559 --> 00:00:37,040
siding covert channels uh exploiting

14
00:00:37,040 --> 00:00:38,079
them in practice

15
00:00:38,079 --> 00:00:40,320
among smartphone apps by basically

16
00:00:40,320 --> 00:00:41,360
running the apps

17
00:00:41,360 --> 00:00:42,800
seeing the network transmissions that

18
00:00:42,800 --> 00:00:44,640
are being sent and

19
00:00:44,640 --> 00:00:47,039
if it was protected by a permission like

20
00:00:47,039 --> 00:00:48,079
location

21
00:00:48,079 --> 00:00:50,399
and it didn't have that permission flag

22
00:00:50,399 --> 00:00:52,239
it for further analysis and

23
00:00:52,239 --> 00:00:54,559
this method was somewhat successful we

24
00:00:54,559 --> 00:00:55,440
found

25
00:00:55,440 --> 00:00:57,039
um for instance an app that was reading

26
00:00:57,039 --> 00:00:58,960
the arp cache to get the router mac

27
00:00:58,960 --> 00:00:59,680
address

28
00:00:59,680 --> 00:01:01,520
it didn't have location permission and

29
00:01:01,520 --> 00:01:03,359
you need location permission

30
00:01:03,359 --> 00:01:04,959
to get the mac address of routers

31
00:01:04,959 --> 00:01:06,880
because the internet basically knows

32
00:01:06,880 --> 00:01:08,720
where all the routers are and they don't

33
00:01:08,720 --> 00:01:10,560
typically move around a lot so these

34
00:01:10,560 --> 00:01:12,720
mac addresses and ssids have become a

35
00:01:12,720 --> 00:01:14,799
surrogate for location

36
00:01:14,799 --> 00:01:17,759
we found that another app was wholesale

37
00:01:17,759 --> 00:01:19,759
uploading all of your xf metadata

38
00:01:19,759 --> 00:01:21,360
because it was classy like that

39
00:01:21,360 --> 00:01:23,680
and it included latitude and longitude

40
00:01:23,680 --> 00:01:26,080
as part of just geotagged images which

41
00:01:26,080 --> 00:01:27,680
we saw being sent

42
00:01:27,680 --> 00:01:30,320
um baidu was saving the imei to the sd

43
00:01:30,320 --> 00:01:30,960
card so

44
00:01:30,960 --> 00:01:33,360
the same sdk from baidu in another app

45
00:01:33,360 --> 00:01:34,799
that didn't have permission to access

46
00:01:34,799 --> 00:01:36,880
imei i could read it out

47
00:01:36,880 --> 00:01:40,159
and the advertising company slash

48
00:01:40,159 --> 00:01:43,119
game engine unity was using an iocto to

49
00:01:43,119 --> 00:01:43,439
get

50
00:01:43,439 --> 00:01:46,079
the mac address of the device so the

51
00:01:46,079 --> 00:01:47,920
device mac address is not a

52
00:01:47,920 --> 00:01:49,840
location circuit anymore but rather this

53
00:01:49,840 --> 00:01:51,920
becomes a sort of unresettable super

54
00:01:51,920 --> 00:01:53,680
cookie to just track users

55
00:01:53,680 --> 00:01:55,360
a serial number burned into your device

56
00:01:55,360 --> 00:01:57,280
that you just can't change

57
00:01:57,280 --> 00:02:00,079
and in fact android since version 6 so

58
00:02:00,079 --> 00:02:01,119
2015

59
00:02:01,119 --> 00:02:03,600
has not allowed apps to get the mac

60
00:02:03,600 --> 00:02:05,119
address of the device for

61
00:02:05,119 --> 00:02:08,560
for this particular purpose so

62
00:02:08,560 --> 00:02:10,560
this method though keeps giving us new

63
00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:12,000
results so here i'm going to

64
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:13,599
talk about two new findings we've made

65
00:02:13,599 --> 00:02:15,840
and one variation of a theme that we saw

66
00:02:15,840 --> 00:02:16,800
before

67
00:02:16,800 --> 00:02:19,680
so the first one comes to us from cnn

68
00:02:19,680 --> 00:02:21,040
cnn is an american

69
00:02:21,040 --> 00:02:23,840
news based entertainment company and we

70
00:02:23,840 --> 00:02:24,400
saw them

71
00:02:24,400 --> 00:02:27,720
transmitting a payload of data to class

72
00:02:27,720 --> 00:02:30,959
ws.tv this chunk of data and when you do

73
00:02:30,959 --> 00:02:32,400
this sort of analysis enough you just

74
00:02:32,400 --> 00:02:32,800
see

75
00:02:32,800 --> 00:02:35,200
the beginning e y capital j that's

76
00:02:35,200 --> 00:02:37,440
base64 for json objects so the first

77
00:02:37,440 --> 00:02:38,400
thing you do

78
00:02:38,400 --> 00:02:40,800
basic c4 decoded get a json object and

79
00:02:40,800 --> 00:02:41,920
when we looked at it

80
00:02:41,920 --> 00:02:43,760
we can see that sure enough there is the

81
00:02:43,760 --> 00:02:45,920
ssid of the device being sent

82
00:02:45,920 --> 00:02:49,519
out over the network yet the

83
00:02:49,519 --> 00:02:51,440
location data was not present it was

84
00:02:51,440 --> 00:02:53,519
unknown so the app in fact did not have

85
00:02:53,519 --> 00:02:54,720
the location permission

86
00:02:54,720 --> 00:02:57,920
yet somehow it was accessing the

87
00:02:57,920 --> 00:03:00,400
mac address or the ssid of the router

88
00:03:00,400 --> 00:03:02,560
that it was connected to so location

89
00:03:02,560 --> 00:03:05,040
surrogate so we looked at the app to see

90
00:03:05,040 --> 00:03:06,560
how it was doing it

91
00:03:06,560 --> 00:03:08,400
and normally when you look at an app

92
00:03:08,400 --> 00:03:09,760
it's obfuscated so

93
00:03:09,760 --> 00:03:11,760
all the variables are replaced with a b

94
00:03:11,760 --> 00:03:12,879
c and stuff like that

95
00:03:12,879 --> 00:03:14,560
whereas in this one it wasn't the

96
00:03:14,560 --> 00:03:16,400
developer human meaningful variable

97
00:03:16,400 --> 00:03:18,560
names were still present and the one

98
00:03:18,560 --> 00:03:20,560
that was responsible for setting

99
00:03:20,560 --> 00:03:23,120
the field in the json object was called

100
00:03:23,120 --> 00:03:24,400
hacked ssid

101
00:03:24,400 --> 00:03:25,840
so a developer wrote at some point

102
00:03:25,840 --> 00:03:27,440
string hacked ssid

103
00:03:27,440 --> 00:03:29,760
and semicolon and so now the question is

104
00:03:29,760 --> 00:03:31,599
how is this filled out

105
00:03:31,599 --> 00:03:34,480
so it turns out there was a specific

106
00:03:34,480 --> 00:03:36,400
android pie network manager class they

107
00:03:36,400 --> 00:03:37,360
had created

108
00:03:37,360 --> 00:03:40,319
to circumvent the permission system on

109
00:03:40,319 --> 00:03:41,760
android pie because earlier

110
00:03:41,760 --> 00:03:43,920
they didn't need to but as of pi they

111
00:03:43,920 --> 00:03:45,280
needed to so they had a special

112
00:03:45,280 --> 00:03:46,080
workaround

113
00:03:46,080 --> 00:03:49,840
to circumvent the permission system

114
00:03:49,840 --> 00:03:52,959
and they used effectively a network

115
00:03:52,959 --> 00:03:54,959
callback so they found that there's this

116
00:03:54,959 --> 00:03:56,720
network capabilities callback when the

117
00:03:56,720 --> 00:03:58,239
capabilities changed

118
00:03:58,239 --> 00:04:00,720
a callback function is invoked this is

119
00:04:00,720 --> 00:04:01,360
from

120
00:04:01,360 --> 00:04:05,040
uh just the android developers and and

121
00:04:05,040 --> 00:04:06,720
it happened to be that one of the fields

122
00:04:06,720 --> 00:04:08,159
in the callback

123
00:04:08,159 --> 00:04:09,439
there was an extra data field it

124
00:04:09,439 --> 00:04:11,599
contained the ssid this was an oversight

125
00:04:11,599 --> 00:04:12,799
it shouldn't have had that

126
00:04:12,799 --> 00:04:15,120
uh and so we were able to responsibly

127
00:04:15,120 --> 00:04:16,320
disclose this

128
00:04:16,320 --> 00:04:19,199
and uh get it repaired and got a cd and

129
00:04:19,199 --> 00:04:20,238
a bug bounty

130
00:04:20,238 --> 00:04:22,400
and it is unfortunate the developer who

131
00:04:22,400 --> 00:04:23,360
discovered this didn't

132
00:04:23,360 --> 00:04:24,880
follow the same route and chose instead

133
00:04:24,880 --> 00:04:26,400
to exploit it but that is

134
00:04:26,400 --> 00:04:29,840
how it is our second example

135
00:04:29,840 --> 00:04:32,080
comes to us from dev to dev and so if

136
00:04:32,080 --> 00:04:32,960
you're like me

137
00:04:32,960 --> 00:04:34,960
you've also never heard of them so to

138
00:04:34,960 --> 00:04:36,160
give an introduction they are a

139
00:04:36,160 --> 00:04:38,000
comprehensive solution that analyzes

140
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:39,440
your apps and games and gives you

141
00:04:39,440 --> 00:04:40,960
valuable insights

142
00:04:40,960 --> 00:04:43,280
and so one of the things they send is

143
00:04:43,280 --> 00:04:44,240
the device

144
00:04:44,240 --> 00:04:46,400
mac address the again the super cookie

145
00:04:46,400 --> 00:04:48,560
this unresettable identifier tied to the

146
00:04:48,560 --> 00:04:49,360
device

147
00:04:49,360 --> 00:04:51,520
and any transmission of this is not

148
00:04:51,520 --> 00:04:53,840
allowed as of android 6 and higher

149
00:04:53,840 --> 00:04:56,400
so this in itself represents a violation

150
00:04:56,400 --> 00:04:58,000
of the permission system

151
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:01,600
so how is it obtaining this information

152
00:05:01,600 --> 00:05:03,680
well the first thing we did was we grep

153
00:05:03,680 --> 00:05:04,639
for the string

154
00:05:04,639 --> 00:05:07,680
inside the inside the program and we see

155
00:05:07,680 --> 00:05:08,960
what we don't want to see which is

156
00:05:08,960 --> 00:05:09,759
basically

157
00:05:09,759 --> 00:05:13,440
a giant 20 megabyte binary object is the

158
00:05:13,440 --> 00:05:15,039
one that contains the string

159
00:05:15,039 --> 00:05:16,800
so reversing it will be a little more

160
00:05:16,800 --> 00:05:19,360
challenging we look inside and it's just

161
00:05:19,360 --> 00:05:21,120
a string next to all the other strings

162
00:05:21,120 --> 00:05:23,120
it occurs two times in the same story

163
00:05:23,120 --> 00:05:24,160
each time

164
00:05:24,160 --> 00:05:27,280
so we have a challenge ahead of us but

165
00:05:27,280 --> 00:05:29,199
thinking back to how we looked at unity

166
00:05:29,199 --> 00:05:30,800
and its use of an ioctyl

167
00:05:30,800 --> 00:05:33,440
if it's happening in native code if this

168
00:05:33,440 --> 00:05:34,880
access the mac address is happening in

169
00:05:34,880 --> 00:05:35,680
native code

170
00:05:35,680 --> 00:05:37,759
it's going to either be a system call or

171
00:05:37,759 --> 00:05:39,600
it's going to be somewhere in libsy

172
00:05:39,600 --> 00:05:41,600
so we can just instrument those things

173
00:05:41,600 --> 00:05:43,600
so we go to the linux operating system

174
00:05:43,600 --> 00:05:44,400
we find the

175
00:05:44,400 --> 00:05:46,320
implementation of ioctyl and we add our

176
00:05:46,320 --> 00:05:47,840
own little instrumentation

177
00:05:47,840 --> 00:05:50,160
no it's not happening in nioctyl okay

178
00:05:50,160 --> 00:05:50,960
what about

179
00:05:50,960 --> 00:05:53,360
sock opt no it's not happening there

180
00:05:53,360 --> 00:05:54,080
either

181
00:05:54,080 --> 00:05:56,319
and then we stumble across this function

182
00:05:56,319 --> 00:05:57,840
get if adders

183
00:05:57,840 --> 00:06:00,240
so get if adders returns a linked list

184
00:06:00,240 --> 00:06:01,120
structure

185
00:06:01,120 --> 00:06:04,000
and one of the fields happens to be the

186
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:04,880
mac address

187
00:06:04,880 --> 00:06:08,319
of the device of the hardware interface

188
00:06:08,319 --> 00:06:10,319
now this particular function is not in

189
00:06:10,319 --> 00:06:11,520
posix it comes to

190
00:06:11,520 --> 00:06:13,919
us by way of bsd but in the bsd

191
00:06:13,919 --> 00:06:14,960
implementation

192
00:06:14,960 --> 00:06:17,120
if there is a ip address it does not

193
00:06:17,120 --> 00:06:18,960
provide any link layer information like

194
00:06:18,960 --> 00:06:20,160
the mac address

195
00:06:20,160 --> 00:06:22,639
so in the linux implementation it does

196
00:06:22,639 --> 00:06:23,759
and this is how

197
00:06:23,759 --> 00:06:25,600
they were able to get the mac address of

198
00:06:25,600 --> 00:06:27,199
the device or at least

199
00:06:27,199 --> 00:06:29,039
at this point this becomes a possible

200
00:06:29,039 --> 00:06:30,720
way and so we wanted to confirm that

201
00:06:30,720 --> 00:06:31,680
this is indeed

202
00:06:31,680 --> 00:06:33,520
the way that they were doing it so we go

203
00:06:33,520 --> 00:06:35,680
to the implementation and we modify it

204
00:06:35,680 --> 00:06:37,759
and what we do is effectively make the

205
00:06:37,759 --> 00:06:39,360
mac address a palindrome we just

206
00:06:39,360 --> 00:06:41,120
make it conspicuous in some way so that

207
00:06:41,120 --> 00:06:42,880
we know that indeed this is the code

208
00:06:42,880 --> 00:06:43,520
path

209
00:06:43,520 --> 00:06:45,680
that it went through in order to perform

210
00:06:45,680 --> 00:06:46,880
this exploit

211
00:06:46,880 --> 00:06:48,240
and sure enough when we looked at the

212
00:06:48,240 --> 00:06:50,000
network transmission afterwards we see

213
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:52,080
that our conspicuous mac address is as

214
00:06:52,080 --> 00:06:53,120
we had designed it

215
00:06:53,120 --> 00:06:55,039
and so can conclude yes this is the

216
00:06:55,039 --> 00:06:56,960
route that they are using

217
00:06:56,960 --> 00:06:59,440
now there's another interesting thing

218
00:06:59,440 --> 00:07:00,560
about dev to dev

219
00:07:00,560 --> 00:07:02,160
that i want to talk about that came to

220
00:07:02,160 --> 00:07:04,400
light as we were doing this analysis

221
00:07:04,400 --> 00:07:06,880
and this has to do with the advertising

222
00:07:06,880 --> 00:07:08,880
id so if you have an android phone

223
00:07:08,880 --> 00:07:10,960
you'll have an advertising id and you

224
00:07:10,960 --> 00:07:12,160
can see here this one

225
00:07:12,160 --> 00:07:15,120
this begins with ced at the beginning

226
00:07:15,120 --> 00:07:16,000
and

227
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:17,919
maybe you don't want to have your

228
00:07:17,919 --> 00:07:19,759
advertising id being able to track you

229
00:07:19,759 --> 00:07:20,160
across

230
00:07:20,160 --> 00:07:21,360
apps while you're using your device

231
00:07:21,360 --> 00:07:23,280
maybe you just are you don't want it so

232
00:07:23,280 --> 00:07:24,479
you want to opt out

233
00:07:24,479 --> 00:07:25,840
so there is an opt-out of ads

234
00:07:25,840 --> 00:07:28,160
personalization you can press the button

235
00:07:28,160 --> 00:07:30,000
and it sets it to blue

236
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:32,039
however this really has no

237
00:07:32,039 --> 00:07:33,759
consequentiality in terms of

238
00:07:33,759 --> 00:07:36,479
accessing the advertising id it's more

239
00:07:36,479 --> 00:07:38,160
like the don't be evil bit

240
00:07:38,160 --> 00:07:41,360
being set because all it does in many of

241
00:07:41,360 --> 00:07:42,639
the network traffics that we've looked

242
00:07:42,639 --> 00:07:44,160
at it just sets the is limited ad

243
00:07:44,160 --> 00:07:46,000
tracking enabled to true or do not track

244
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:46,960
as true

245
00:07:46,960 --> 00:07:49,199
yet the advertising id seen at the top

246
00:07:49,199 --> 00:07:50,240
the ced

247
00:07:50,240 --> 00:07:51,759
it's still there as well so it's

248
00:07:51,759 --> 00:07:53,520
effectively saying to the company

249
00:07:53,520 --> 00:07:56,319
here's the user's identifier but don't

250
00:07:56,319 --> 00:07:57,199
use it in any

251
00:07:57,199 --> 00:07:58,960
context don't use it for behavioral

252
00:07:58,960 --> 00:08:00,720
advertising don't build a dossier

253
00:08:00,720 --> 00:08:03,840
just don't use it at all so maybe that's

254
00:08:03,840 --> 00:08:05,599
not the best way to implement this

255
00:08:05,599 --> 00:08:08,000
so what about the other option you have

256
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:09,759
at your disposal you can reset your

257
00:08:09,759 --> 00:08:10,800
advertising id

258
00:08:10,800 --> 00:08:13,360
it replaces it with a new random number

259
00:08:13,360 --> 00:08:16,160
so now we have one that begins with 380.

260
00:08:16,160 --> 00:08:18,639
so the idea here is your new identity is

261
00:08:18,639 --> 00:08:20,080
unlinked to your old one there's no

262
00:08:20,080 --> 00:08:21,680
connection between the two it's a truly

263
00:08:21,680 --> 00:08:22,560
random number

264
00:08:22,560 --> 00:08:25,120
and now going forwards all of your new

265
00:08:25,120 --> 00:08:26,400
transactions will be with this

266
00:08:26,400 --> 00:08:29,199
new number now this would be great if it

267
00:08:29,199 --> 00:08:31,120
happened every minute instead of being

268
00:08:31,120 --> 00:08:32,958
deliberate action under five layers of

269
00:08:32,958 --> 00:08:34,479
menu but still it's the

270
00:08:34,479 --> 00:08:37,200
the best that we sort of have however

271
00:08:37,200 --> 00:08:39,039
dev to dev found a workaround which is

272
00:08:39,039 --> 00:08:40,399
to just send both

273
00:08:40,399 --> 00:08:42,799
and it even calls the old one preve in

274
00:08:42,799 --> 00:08:44,560
the http query argument

275
00:08:44,560 --> 00:08:47,279
sending the old advertising id preview

276
00:08:47,279 --> 00:08:49,040
equals the one beginning with ced

277
00:08:49,040 --> 00:08:50,640
and the current one uid the one

278
00:08:50,640 --> 00:08:52,160
beginning with 380

279
00:08:52,160 --> 00:08:54,000
and this occurs after rebooting the

280
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:55,839
device meaning that they must save it

281
00:08:55,839 --> 00:08:57,200
somewhere on the device

282
00:08:57,200 --> 00:08:59,120
to actually remember that this was in

283
00:08:59,120 --> 00:09:00,240
fact the old

284
00:09:00,240 --> 00:09:03,279
advertising id our

285
00:09:03,279 --> 00:09:06,480
final example is from the dub music

286
00:09:06,480 --> 00:09:08,240
player so suppose for some reason

287
00:09:08,240 --> 00:09:10,399
you wanted to listen to dub music then

288
00:09:10,399 --> 00:09:11,760
maybe you have this app

289
00:09:11,760 --> 00:09:13,120
and if you have this app then you'll be

290
00:09:13,120 --> 00:09:15,600
talking to measurelib.com

291
00:09:15,600 --> 00:09:17,920
and in this particular example they are

292
00:09:17,920 --> 00:09:19,080
sending a

293
00:09:19,080 --> 00:09:22,480
28 kilobyte gzip

294
00:09:22,480 --> 00:09:25,320
upload of post data to

295
00:09:25,320 --> 00:09:26,720
mobile.measurelib.com

296
00:09:26,720 --> 00:09:30,000
so what are they sending well the

297
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:33,040
bulk of it is a complete dump of all of

298
00:09:33,040 --> 00:09:34,560
the apps that you have installed

299
00:09:34,560 --> 00:09:36,160
on your device all the permissions they

300
00:09:36,160 --> 00:09:37,440
require when they were installed when

301
00:09:37,440 --> 00:09:38,320
they were updated

302
00:09:38,320 --> 00:09:40,640
including the full file system directory

303
00:09:40,640 --> 00:09:41,440
path

304
00:09:41,440 --> 00:09:45,120
where they're located and that's

305
00:09:45,120 --> 00:09:46,959
bizarre but all right and they are also

306
00:09:46,959 --> 00:09:48,800
sending more relevant for our purposes

307
00:09:48,800 --> 00:09:49,279
in our

308
00:09:49,279 --> 00:09:51,440
survey where they included the router

309
00:09:51,440 --> 00:09:52,640
mac address again

310
00:09:52,640 --> 00:09:54,800
the surrogate for location and

311
00:09:54,800 --> 00:09:56,399
noteworthy they did not have

312
00:09:56,399 --> 00:09:58,000
the location permission so they should

313
00:09:58,000 --> 00:09:59,680
not have been able to access

314
00:09:59,680 --> 00:10:02,000
this value at all now so you might be

315
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:03,040
wondering why

316
00:10:03,040 --> 00:10:04,640
report all this why are they collecting

317
00:10:04,640 --> 00:10:06,399
all this why report it

318
00:10:06,399 --> 00:10:08,560
and indeed they even purport to answer

319
00:10:08,560 --> 00:10:09,519
that why

320
00:10:09,519 --> 00:10:11,600
report but their answer is not very

321
00:10:11,600 --> 00:10:12,560
satisfying they

322
00:10:12,560 --> 00:10:15,120
say because the app launched or a little

323
00:10:15,120 --> 00:10:16,480
bit later why report

324
00:10:16,480 --> 00:10:18,720
because report interval expired all

325
00:10:18,720 --> 00:10:20,800
right well not quite a satisfying answer

326
00:10:20,800 --> 00:10:21,519
but still

327
00:10:21,519 --> 00:10:24,399
interesting all the same so how did they

328
00:10:24,399 --> 00:10:24,720
get

329
00:10:24,720 --> 00:10:27,279
the router mac address well when we

330
00:10:27,279 --> 00:10:29,279
looked at other traffic coming from this

331
00:10:29,279 --> 00:10:31,200
app we saw that it was doing a

332
00:10:31,200 --> 00:10:32,560
plug-and-play discovery

333
00:10:32,560 --> 00:10:34,640
on the home network sending out a

334
00:10:34,640 --> 00:10:35,839
broadcast message

335
00:10:35,839 --> 00:10:38,560
to all of the devices nearby asking for

336
00:10:38,560 --> 00:10:40,399
configuration details

337
00:10:40,399 --> 00:10:42,560
and sure enough the router hap believer

338
00:10:42,560 --> 00:10:44,720
is back and part of the reply in the

339
00:10:44,720 --> 00:10:45,760
uuid

340
00:10:45,760 --> 00:10:48,880
the node component is in fact the 48-bit

341
00:10:48,880 --> 00:10:50,880
mac address being sent back

342
00:10:50,880 --> 00:10:52,720
and you have to remember that these apps

343
00:10:52,720 --> 00:10:54,640
and all of the third-party code that's

344
00:10:54,640 --> 00:10:55,200
included

345
00:10:55,200 --> 00:10:56,959
they're running in the trusted part of

346
00:10:56,959 --> 00:10:58,720
the home network the firewall exists to

347
00:10:58,720 --> 00:11:00,320
keep the bad guys from the outside from

348
00:11:00,320 --> 00:11:00,880
getting in

349
00:11:00,880 --> 00:11:02,560
but once you're in you're free to chat

350
00:11:02,560 --> 00:11:04,880
with a router it seems

351
00:11:04,880 --> 00:11:07,360
so we wanted to understand what was

352
00:11:07,360 --> 00:11:08,160
happening

353
00:11:08,160 --> 00:11:10,000
and where where this code was occurring

354
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:12,000
so we do our searches we grep for

355
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:12,640
measure it

356
00:11:12,640 --> 00:11:14,160
couldn't find it we grew up for wi-fi

357
00:11:14,160 --> 00:11:15,600
mac couldn't find it we grabbed for y

358
00:11:15,600 --> 00:11:17,279
report couldn't find it

359
00:11:17,279 --> 00:11:19,360
so something bizarre is happening

360
00:11:19,360 --> 00:11:20,959
there's no evidence of any of the

361
00:11:20,959 --> 00:11:22,000
strings that we saw

362
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:25,920
being anywhere in the code so

363
00:11:25,920 --> 00:11:28,640
our trick to then is to find other apps

364
00:11:28,640 --> 00:11:30,399
that happen to be running the same

365
00:11:30,399 --> 00:11:32,399
or communicating with the same domains

366
00:11:32,399 --> 00:11:34,079
and seeing what code they have in common

367
00:11:34,079 --> 00:11:35,120
because at this point

368
00:11:35,120 --> 00:11:37,440
it could be any of a number of sdks in

369
00:11:37,440 --> 00:11:39,440
this app the search space is huge

370
00:11:39,440 --> 00:11:41,760
but here we can window it down to just

371
00:11:41,760 --> 00:11:44,079
the specific third-party library that

372
00:11:44,079 --> 00:11:46,079
happens to be in all of these other apps

373
00:11:46,079 --> 00:11:48,079
which we find is this one called coolest

374
00:11:48,079 --> 00:11:50,480
library so we start looking into who's

375
00:11:50,480 --> 00:11:52,480
responsible for coolest library

376
00:11:52,480 --> 00:11:54,320
and what we find is literally five

377
00:11:54,320 --> 00:11:56,000
results and two of them have

378
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:57,680
malware in the title so not a very good

379
00:11:57,680 --> 00:11:59,360
sign but after some

380
00:11:59,360 --> 00:12:01,760
investigation i believe it was a sort of

381
00:12:01,760 --> 00:12:03,839
stack overflow style question an answer

382
00:12:03,839 --> 00:12:05,200
site where a developer was asking for

383
00:12:05,200 --> 00:12:07,279
help integrating this library

384
00:12:07,279 --> 00:12:09,839
we managed to find an unlinked website

385
00:12:09,839 --> 00:12:10,959
that had

386
00:12:10,959 --> 00:12:12,959
the information from the provider of the

387
00:12:12,959 --> 00:12:14,959
library including how to integrate it

388
00:12:14,959 --> 00:12:16,720
and going to their website we find that

389
00:12:16,720 --> 00:12:18,639
it is a panamanian company called

390
00:12:18,639 --> 00:12:19,920
measurement systems

391
00:12:19,920 --> 00:12:22,399
the internet measurement authority and

392
00:12:22,399 --> 00:12:24,160
not much other information can

393
00:12:24,160 --> 00:12:26,320
really be learned about this particular

394
00:12:26,320 --> 00:12:28,240
entity

395
00:12:28,240 --> 00:12:30,880
but what about its strings so why were

396
00:12:30,880 --> 00:12:32,560
all of those strings not present

397
00:12:32,560 --> 00:12:35,120
well going into the coolest library we

398
00:12:35,120 --> 00:12:36,480
look for the strings and we find that

399
00:12:36,480 --> 00:12:37,040
they're all

400
00:12:37,040 --> 00:12:39,279
base64 encoded okay well maybe that's

401
00:12:39,279 --> 00:12:41,920
why but when we basic c4 decode them

402
00:12:41,920 --> 00:12:43,360
we still don't see anything that we're

403
00:12:43,360 --> 00:12:44,639
looking for we still don't see why

404
00:12:44,639 --> 00:12:45,839
report

405
00:12:45,839 --> 00:12:48,880
so looking at the code what we find is

406
00:12:48,880 --> 00:12:51,600
that every time a string is used

407
00:12:51,600 --> 00:12:54,320
it is passed to this d dot g function

408
00:12:54,320 --> 00:12:55,040
and this d

409
00:12:55,040 --> 00:12:56,880
g function takes a string returns a

410
00:12:56,880 --> 00:12:58,880
string and the return value is the key

411
00:12:58,880 --> 00:13:00,399
in that json object so

412
00:13:00,399 --> 00:13:03,040
whatever is happening in dot g is what

413
00:13:03,040 --> 00:13:03,440
we're

414
00:13:03,440 --> 00:13:05,279
well we're after is explaining this

415
00:13:05,279 --> 00:13:06,959
mystery so

416
00:13:06,959 --> 00:13:08,959
i won't go into the full details of it

417
00:13:08,959 --> 00:13:10,320
here but here's a faithful

418
00:13:10,320 --> 00:13:11,519
representation with my own

419
00:13:11,519 --> 00:13:13,440
interpretation of what the variables are

420
00:13:13,440 --> 00:13:14,959
for the ddg function

421
00:13:14,959 --> 00:13:17,200
first they base64 decode it then they

422
00:13:17,200 --> 00:13:18,480
construct a password

423
00:13:18,480 --> 00:13:20,399
out of two parts a static function

424
00:13:20,399 --> 00:13:21,920
returning mia and another one saying

425
00:13:21,920 --> 00:13:23,440
sure to create the word measure

426
00:13:23,440 --> 00:13:24,800
they do the same with the salt create

427
00:13:24,800 --> 00:13:26,959
measure move measure they do 10 rounds

428
00:13:26,959 --> 00:13:28,639
of password-based encryption

429
00:13:28,639 --> 00:13:31,519
they then get a static iv and use aes in

430
00:13:31,519 --> 00:13:34,079
cbc mode to decrypt the actual string

431
00:13:34,079 --> 00:13:35,839
and it's great that they're only using

432
00:13:35,839 --> 00:13:37,519
10 rounds of password-based encryption

433
00:13:37,519 --> 00:13:39,680
here because this is happening for every

434
00:13:39,680 --> 00:13:40,800
single string

435
00:13:40,800 --> 00:13:43,279
for every single time is ever being used

436
00:13:43,279 --> 00:13:43,839
to create

437
00:13:43,839 --> 00:13:46,480
this 28 kilobyte json object every

438
00:13:46,480 --> 00:13:47,279
single time

439
00:13:47,279 --> 00:13:49,360
no caching at all but these sorts of

440
00:13:49,360 --> 00:13:51,440
techniques do

441
00:13:51,440 --> 00:13:53,440
slow down the sort of analysis that we

442
00:13:53,440 --> 00:13:55,519
do because string search is really

443
00:13:55,519 --> 00:13:57,440
the first step towards understanding

444
00:13:57,440 --> 00:13:58,720
what's actually happening

445
00:13:58,720 --> 00:14:01,920
inside these libraries so thank you very

446
00:14:01,920 --> 00:14:02,399
much

447
00:14:02,399 --> 00:14:05,040
for your attention um uh these sort of

448
00:14:05,040 --> 00:14:06,480
stories i've been meaning to put on our

449
00:14:06,480 --> 00:14:08,639
blog blog.census.io

450
00:14:08,639 --> 00:14:11,199
and so now maybe a little more motivated

451
00:14:11,199 --> 00:14:12,399
to actually get these written up

452
00:14:12,399 --> 00:14:13,839
but we have other stories there as well

453
00:14:13,839 --> 00:14:16,399
that we report from our findings and

454
00:14:16,399 --> 00:14:18,480
try to target it somewhat at a high

455
00:14:18,480 --> 00:14:20,240
undergrad level for a security style

456
00:14:20,240 --> 00:14:21,680
course of teaching some of the security

457
00:14:21,680 --> 00:14:22,399
concepts

458
00:14:22,399 --> 00:14:24,000
as we go along one of the ad networks

459
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:26,639
for instance uh using frequency analysis

460
00:14:26,639 --> 00:14:27,120
to do

461
00:14:27,120 --> 00:14:29,199
break a vigenera style cipher like these

462
00:14:29,199 --> 00:14:30,160
sort of things

463
00:14:30,160 --> 00:14:31,760
sort of work and so we detail these

464
00:14:31,760 --> 00:14:35,920
stories in our blog thank you very much

465
00:14:35,950 --> 00:14:37,199
[Music]

466
00:14:37,199 --> 00:14:40,160
okay let's thank joel and our next

467
00:14:40,160 --> 00:14:42,240
speaker is eleanor

468
00:14:42,240 --> 00:14:45,120
who's going to be talking about uh some

469
00:14:45,120 --> 00:14:46,079
legal stuff

470
00:14:46,079 --> 00:14:48,880
to complement the we should have had you

471
00:14:48,880 --> 00:14:50,720
actually the first speaker after the

472
00:14:50,720 --> 00:14:51,839
keynote given

473
00:14:51,839 --> 00:14:54,240
the the tie-in but it is what it is so

474
00:14:54,240 --> 00:14:59,839
take it away

475
00:15:04,800 --> 00:15:13,680
i do not hear you you are muted

476
00:15:13,680 --> 00:15:16,639
all right so please continue chiming in

477
00:15:16,639 --> 00:15:17,600
if at any point

478
00:15:17,600 --> 00:15:19,199
you cannot hear me or you cannot see

479
00:15:19,199 --> 00:15:20,639
what you think is an appropriate thing

480
00:15:20,639 --> 00:15:21,680
to be seeing

481
00:15:21,680 --> 00:15:26,320
at that point in the talk

482
00:15:26,320 --> 00:15:28,880
so today i want to talk about some work

483
00:15:28,880 --> 00:15:30,639
that i've been doing with my research

484
00:15:30,639 --> 00:15:32,480
lab over the last year or so

485
00:15:32,480 --> 00:15:34,800
looking at ccpa the new california

486
00:15:34,800 --> 00:15:36,160
privacy regulation

487
00:15:36,160 --> 00:15:38,079
and this is work that i did with two of

488
00:15:38,079 --> 00:15:40,320
my students at pomona college

489
00:15:40,320 --> 00:15:42,639
shawn and aiden and also with ryan who

490
00:15:42,639 --> 00:15:43,600
was a high school intern

491
00:15:43,600 --> 00:15:45,199
with my group last summer and is

492
00:15:45,199 --> 00:15:46,720
starting an undergrad at uc berkeley

493
00:15:46,720 --> 00:15:48,800
this fall

494
00:15:48,800 --> 00:15:50,240
the starting point of this work is that

495
00:15:50,240 --> 00:15:52,399
well pomona college is in los

496
00:15:52,399 --> 00:15:54,639
angeles california so when i first moved

497
00:15:54,639 --> 00:15:56,560
out to la about three years ago

498
00:15:56,560 --> 00:15:58,720
i was really excited to discover that

499
00:15:58,720 --> 00:16:00,480
california was in the process

500
00:16:00,480 --> 00:16:03,759
of just signing into regulation a new

501
00:16:03,759 --> 00:16:05,279
privacy law

502
00:16:05,279 --> 00:16:07,519
and so last summer shortly before it

503
00:16:07,519 --> 00:16:08,639
went into effect

504
00:16:08,639 --> 00:16:10,959
i thought it'd be fun to look and see

505
00:16:10,959 --> 00:16:12,480
what's going on with that law

506
00:16:12,480 --> 00:16:14,320
and how much privacy are people going to

507
00:16:14,320 --> 00:16:16,880
actually get

508
00:16:16,959 --> 00:16:19,600
at the time i'd been hoping that a

509
00:16:19,600 --> 00:16:21,040
little over a year later

510
00:16:21,040 --> 00:16:23,279
i'd be able to stand in front of a room

511
00:16:23,279 --> 00:16:24,720
with all of you in person

512
00:16:24,720 --> 00:16:26,560
and give you this talk clear and

513
00:16:26,560 --> 00:16:28,639
conspicuous the right to opt out of sale

514
00:16:28,639 --> 00:16:31,279
under ccpa

515
00:16:31,279 --> 00:16:32,880
unfortunately that went wrong in a

516
00:16:32,880 --> 00:16:35,040
couple of ways first of all

517
00:16:35,040 --> 00:16:37,519
as many of you have probably noticed we

518
00:16:37,519 --> 00:16:39,759
are not in person

519
00:16:39,759 --> 00:16:41,920
second of all i don't feel like i can

520
00:16:41,920 --> 00:16:43,680
honestly give you this talk

521
00:16:43,680 --> 00:16:44,880
so instead i'm going to give you a

522
00:16:44,880 --> 00:16:47,279
slightly different talk called unclear

523
00:16:47,279 --> 00:16:47,600
and

524
00:16:47,600 --> 00:16:49,600
inconspicuous the right to opt out of

525
00:16:49,600 --> 00:16:52,639
sale under ccpa

526
00:16:52,639 --> 00:16:56,800
so to get started what is ccpa

527
00:16:56,800 --> 00:16:58,959
if you've been hanging out in certain

528
00:16:58,959 --> 00:17:00,320
circles there's been a lot of

529
00:17:00,320 --> 00:17:02,480
discussions about ccpa over the last few

530
00:17:02,480 --> 00:17:03,279
years

531
00:17:03,279 --> 00:17:05,280
and a lot of them boil down to this idea

532
00:17:05,280 --> 00:17:07,839
that ccpa is basically gdpr

533
00:17:07,839 --> 00:17:10,319
but for california or but for the united

534
00:17:10,319 --> 00:17:12,400
states

535
00:17:12,400 --> 00:17:14,799
well okay they're both privacy

536
00:17:14,799 --> 00:17:16,559
regulations yes

537
00:17:16,559 --> 00:17:18,880
and there are actually a number of

538
00:17:18,880 --> 00:17:20,799
distinctions between the two laws

539
00:17:20,799 --> 00:17:22,799
that result in different behaviors so i

540
00:17:22,799 --> 00:17:24,959
think it's worth taking a look at ccpa

541
00:17:24,959 --> 00:17:26,480
and seeing what exactly we're getting

542
00:17:26,480 --> 00:17:28,000
out of this law

543
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:32,320
in particular so ccpa is the california

544
00:17:32,320 --> 00:17:34,240
consumer privacy act

545
00:17:34,240 --> 00:17:36,880
like gdpr its idea is to give users more

546
00:17:36,880 --> 00:17:39,600
control over their personal information

547
00:17:39,600 --> 00:17:41,520
and this coastline in four different

548
00:17:41,520 --> 00:17:44,320
rights that california users now have

549
00:17:44,320 --> 00:17:46,000
they have a right to know what's being

550
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:47,360
collected and what's being done with

551
00:17:47,360 --> 00:17:48,320
their data

552
00:17:48,320 --> 00:17:50,080
they have a right to delete certain data

553
00:17:50,080 --> 00:17:52,080
particularly if it's inaccurate

554
00:17:52,080 --> 00:17:53,600
they have a right to opt out of sale of

555
00:17:53,600 --> 00:17:55,200
their data their

556
00:17:55,200 --> 00:17:57,919
right to not be discriminated against

557
00:17:57,919 --> 00:17:59,679
not be retaliated against

558
00:17:59,679 --> 00:18:01,280
if they choose to invoke their rights

559
00:18:01,280 --> 00:18:03,200
under ccpa

560
00:18:03,200 --> 00:18:06,480
and this was signed into law in 2018 and

561
00:18:06,480 --> 00:18:08,240
enforcement for this law began

562
00:18:08,240 --> 00:18:12,080
last summer so this work is focusing on

563
00:18:12,080 --> 00:18:12,960
this third right

564
00:18:12,960 --> 00:18:16,000
is right to opt out of sale what's this

565
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:17,440
right topped out of sale and what is it

566
00:18:17,440 --> 00:18:18,000
about

567
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:20,559
well red topped out of sale is about

568
00:18:20,559 --> 00:18:21,919
giving users the right to opt out of

569
00:18:21,919 --> 00:18:24,799
sale their personal information

570
00:18:24,799 --> 00:18:26,640
one of the interesting things about this

571
00:18:26,640 --> 00:18:28,480
though is the definitions of these

572
00:18:28,480 --> 00:18:30,160
personal information is very broadly

573
00:18:30,160 --> 00:18:32,559
defined it includes anything about a

574
00:18:32,559 --> 00:18:33,280
person

575
00:18:33,280 --> 00:18:35,200
or anything that could reasonably be

576
00:18:35,200 --> 00:18:37,600
linked to an individual or a household

577
00:18:37,600 --> 00:18:40,400
including things like browsing history

578
00:18:40,400 --> 00:18:42,080
your interactions with websites your

579
00:18:42,080 --> 00:18:43,919
interactions with ads on websites

580
00:18:43,919 --> 00:18:45,520
all of that data that we know companies

581
00:18:45,520 --> 00:18:47,440
like to collect

582
00:18:47,440 --> 00:18:49,600
and sale is also broadly defined it

583
00:18:49,600 --> 00:18:50,799
includes selling

584
00:18:50,799 --> 00:18:54,000
but also renting or making available

585
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:57,679
any of this information to businesses

586
00:18:57,679 --> 00:18:59,919
in exchange for money or any other

587
00:18:59,919 --> 00:19:03,200
valuable consideration

588
00:19:03,520 --> 00:19:05,440
and if companies do any of this they

589
00:19:05,440 --> 00:19:07,440
have to give a clear and conspicuous

590
00:19:07,440 --> 00:19:09,440
link on the homepage of their website

591
00:19:09,440 --> 00:19:11,280
and more precisely that link needs to be

592
00:19:11,280 --> 00:19:12,720
called do not sell my personal

593
00:19:12,720 --> 00:19:13,440
information

594
00:19:13,440 --> 00:19:16,640
or do not sell my personal info

595
00:19:16,640 --> 00:19:18,640
so this sounds good this sounds like

596
00:19:18,640 --> 00:19:20,160
we're going to get a lot more privacy

597
00:19:20,160 --> 00:19:21,280
we're going to be able to

598
00:19:21,280 --> 00:19:23,600
prevent companies from selling our data

599
00:19:23,600 --> 00:19:24,960
and we're going to be able to find these

600
00:19:24,960 --> 00:19:27,360
mechanisms and life would be great

601
00:19:27,360 --> 00:19:28,720
of course we started doing this work

602
00:19:28,720 --> 00:19:30,559
there were no actual numbers on

603
00:19:30,559 --> 00:19:32,799
how good we could expect this to be but

604
00:19:32,799 --> 00:19:35,280
we can draw some analogies to some other

605
00:19:35,280 --> 00:19:38,160
sorts of attractions that we've seen one

606
00:19:38,160 --> 00:19:39,360
example might be

607
00:19:39,360 --> 00:19:42,400
the apple's transparency tracking opt-in

608
00:19:42,400 --> 00:19:44,880
that they introduced in ios 14.5 this

609
00:19:44,880 --> 00:19:46,160
spring

610
00:19:46,160 --> 00:19:47,520
there are a number of different metrics

611
00:19:47,520 --> 00:19:49,760
about exactly how what

612
00:19:49,760 --> 00:19:52,880
those opt-out rates look like but it's

613
00:19:52,880 --> 00:19:56,640
approximately 58 percent of users are

614
00:19:56,640 --> 00:19:57,280
saying

615
00:19:57,280 --> 00:20:00,480
this app should not track they're opting

616
00:20:00,480 --> 00:20:01,520
out effectively

617
00:20:01,520 --> 00:20:04,960
of tracking on mobile apps of course if

618
00:20:04,960 --> 00:20:06,799
you used this particular

619
00:20:06,799 --> 00:20:08,960
feature you're probably thinking this is

620
00:20:08,960 --> 00:20:10,720
not a great comparison

621
00:20:10,720 --> 00:20:13,120
to something like ccpa which is true

622
00:20:13,120 --> 00:20:15,200
because these applet interfaces

623
00:20:15,200 --> 00:20:17,600
actually pop up in the app and you have

624
00:20:17,600 --> 00:20:19,679
to click yes or no

625
00:20:19,679 --> 00:20:21,600
so maybe a better comparison would be

626
00:20:21,600 --> 00:20:23,679
looking at cookie banners in europe

627
00:20:23,679 --> 00:20:25,280
if you look at cookie banners well there

628
00:20:25,280 --> 00:20:27,120
was some really nice work in ccs a

629
00:20:27,120 --> 00:20:28,320
couple of years ago

630
00:20:28,320 --> 00:20:30,559
that looked at what the opt-out rates

631
00:20:30,559 --> 00:20:34,240
were for cookie banners after gdpr

632
00:20:34,240 --> 00:20:36,000
and they found that the opt-out rate

633
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:37,760
varied a lot depending on the exact

634
00:20:37,760 --> 00:20:40,400
design choices and the locations but for

635
00:20:40,400 --> 00:20:41,520
common implementations

636
00:20:41,520 --> 00:20:44,880
it was somewhere around 4.5 so we

637
00:20:44,880 --> 00:20:46,159
imagined we could see

638
00:20:46,159 --> 00:20:48,640
something somewhere in that range for

639
00:20:48,640 --> 00:20:49,520
the rate of

640
00:20:49,520 --> 00:20:52,880
opt out of sale for our users

641
00:20:52,880 --> 00:20:55,200
but we wanted to find out so we

642
00:20:55,200 --> 00:20:57,919
implemented a browser extension

643
00:20:57,919 --> 00:21:00,640
that for each website you visit

644
00:21:00,640 --> 00:21:02,159
automatically detects

645
00:21:02,159 --> 00:21:03,840
whether there's a link that will allow

646
00:21:03,840 --> 00:21:05,919
you to opt out of sale

647
00:21:05,919 --> 00:21:08,559
and every time a user visits a website

648
00:21:08,559 --> 00:21:09,360
it logs

649
00:21:09,360 --> 00:21:11,919
well a hash of that website and also

650
00:21:11,919 --> 00:21:13,440
logs whether or not they click on that

651
00:21:13,440 --> 00:21:14,640
link

652
00:21:14,640 --> 00:21:16,960
and we recruited 22 users to install

653
00:21:16,960 --> 00:21:18,240
this browser extension

654
00:21:18,240 --> 00:21:20,000
and sat back and watched for a week what

655
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:22,400
they did

656
00:21:23,200 --> 00:21:25,840
and at the end of the week we discovered

657
00:21:25,840 --> 00:21:28,559
the total opt-out rate was 0

658
00:21:28,559 --> 00:21:30,880
not a single one of our users had opted

659
00:21:30,880 --> 00:21:32,799
out of sale on any of the websites they

660
00:21:32,799 --> 00:21:35,200
visited

661
00:21:35,840 --> 00:21:38,880
so why does that happen well

662
00:21:38,880 --> 00:21:40,559
in order to see why that happens let's

663
00:21:40,559 --> 00:21:42,640
play a game and let's play a game i like

664
00:21:42,640 --> 00:21:43,600
to call

665
00:21:43,600 --> 00:21:46,480
spot the opt out of sale link so i've

666
00:21:46,480 --> 00:21:47,840
got a couple of examples

667
00:21:47,840 --> 00:21:49,760
if you're at home now you can play along

668
00:21:49,760 --> 00:21:51,520
on your own

669
00:21:51,520 --> 00:21:52,720
if you're in california this will

670
00:21:52,720 --> 00:21:54,640
definitely work if you're in some other

671
00:21:54,640 --> 00:21:55,919
jurisdiction unfortunately haven't

672
00:21:55,919 --> 00:21:57,679
tested it although i'm curious to know

673
00:21:57,679 --> 00:21:58,960
if it will

674
00:21:58,960 --> 00:22:02,080
otherwise we can play along together so

675
00:22:02,080 --> 00:22:04,200
let's take a look at this first example

676
00:22:04,200 --> 00:22:05,520
espn.com

677
00:22:05,520 --> 00:22:08,559
here's the home page for espn.com can

678
00:22:08,559 --> 00:22:10,720
you spot the opt out of sale link

679
00:22:10,720 --> 00:22:13,840
on this page

680
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:16,159
you can look around look along the top

681
00:22:16,159 --> 00:22:17,120
of the page

682
00:22:17,120 --> 00:22:19,760
look along the sides of the page of

683
00:22:19,760 --> 00:22:20,240
course

684
00:22:20,240 --> 00:22:21,760
to be fair i'm not showing the whole

685
00:22:21,760 --> 00:22:26,000
website so i can scroll down a bit

686
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:29,120
no no no i can keep scrolling at this

687
00:22:29,120 --> 00:22:30,240
point you've probably seen a bunch of

688
00:22:30,240 --> 00:22:31,760
websites so maybe i should scroll all

689
00:22:31,760 --> 00:22:33,280
the way to the bottom

690
00:22:33,280 --> 00:22:35,600
scroll all the way to the bottom scroll

691
00:22:35,600 --> 00:22:37,120
all the way to the bottom

692
00:22:37,120 --> 00:22:39,360
and then i will discover at the very

693
00:22:39,360 --> 00:22:40,720
bottom of the page

694
00:22:40,720 --> 00:22:43,520
there is a link saying do not sell my

695
00:22:43,520 --> 00:22:45,760
info

696
00:22:45,760 --> 00:22:48,480
and you can ask yourself is that a clear

697
00:22:48,480 --> 00:22:49,679
and conspicuous link

698
00:22:49,679 --> 00:22:54,080
on this home page

699
00:22:54,080 --> 00:22:56,320
here's another example here's the home

700
00:22:56,320 --> 00:22:58,400
page for buzzfeed

701
00:22:58,400 --> 00:23:00,880
and you can say all right can you spot

702
00:23:00,880 --> 00:23:02,320
the opt out of sale link

703
00:23:02,320 --> 00:23:05,360
on this home page at this point you're

704
00:23:05,360 --> 00:23:06,799
probably going

705
00:23:06,799 --> 00:23:08,480
i'm on to you just scroll down to the

706
00:23:08,480 --> 00:23:09,760
bottom okay i'll scroll down to the

707
00:23:09,760 --> 00:23:11,280
bottom scroll scroll scroll scroll

708
00:23:11,280 --> 00:23:12,880
scroll scroll scroll scroll scroll

709
00:23:12,880 --> 00:23:15,520

710
00:23:15,520 --> 00:23:18,559

711
00:23:18,559 --> 00:23:23,840
scroll scroll scroll scroll scroll

712
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:25,340
no opt-out link

713
00:23:25,340 --> 00:23:27,039
[Music]

714
00:23:27,039 --> 00:23:28,720
so in the interest of keeping within the

715
00:23:28,720 --> 00:23:30,480
time limit i'll give you a hint

716
00:23:30,480 --> 00:23:33,200
you go up to the menu at the top and

717
00:23:33,200 --> 00:23:33,600
then

718
00:23:33,600 --> 00:23:37,200
go and look down here you'll see

719
00:23:37,200 --> 00:23:39,600
a link that will allow you to opt out of

720
00:23:39,600 --> 00:23:42,000
the sale of your personal information

721
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:44,640
and so you can ask yourself is that a

722
00:23:44,640 --> 00:23:46,080
clear and conspicuous link

723
00:23:46,080 --> 00:23:48,840
that will allow people to opt out of

724
00:23:48,840 --> 00:23:51,440
sale

725
00:23:51,440 --> 00:23:53,039
and you might be wondering at this point

726
00:23:53,039 --> 00:23:54,640
did i just cherry-pick those two

727
00:23:54,640 --> 00:23:55,520
examples

728
00:23:55,520 --> 00:23:57,440
and well yes and no i didn't make them

729
00:23:57,440 --> 00:23:59,120
at random but

730
00:23:59,120 --> 00:24:00,720
they're actually pretty representative

731
00:24:00,720 --> 00:24:02,799
of the sorts of things we see

732
00:24:02,799 --> 00:24:05,840
so in order to figure this out we ran a

733
00:24:05,840 --> 00:24:07,679
observational study where i had my

734
00:24:07,679 --> 00:24:10,400
students look at the top 500 us websites

735
00:24:10,400 --> 00:24:12,159
and figure out what do their opt-out of

736
00:24:12,159 --> 00:24:15,440
sale mechanisms look like

737
00:24:15,760 --> 00:24:18,400
and we coded them to see do they sell

738
00:24:18,400 --> 00:24:19,200
data

739
00:24:19,200 --> 00:24:20,400
and we specifically were looking at

740
00:24:20,400 --> 00:24:22,320
whether they sell data under ccpa

741
00:24:22,320 --> 00:24:24,159
because you see a lot of things like

742
00:24:24,159 --> 00:24:26,320
we don't sell personal information but

743
00:24:26,320 --> 00:24:29,039
technically under california law we sell

744
00:24:29,039 --> 00:24:30,480
personal information

745
00:24:30,480 --> 00:24:31,600
so we're looking for whether under

746
00:24:31,600 --> 00:24:33,520
california rules they were selling it

747
00:24:33,520 --> 00:24:35,360
and if they were what sort of link do

748
00:24:35,360 --> 00:24:36,799
they have

749
00:24:36,799 --> 00:24:38,799
and in fact we did this not once but we

750
00:24:38,799 --> 00:24:41,120
did this three times

751
00:24:41,120 --> 00:24:44,240
and we discovered two things one is that

752
00:24:44,240 --> 00:24:46,159
well at this point i'm now my student's

753
00:24:46,159 --> 00:24:47,520
favorite person ever and they all

754
00:24:47,520 --> 00:24:49,279
absolutely love me having had to look at

755
00:24:49,279 --> 00:24:51,279
1500 websites

756
00:24:51,279 --> 00:24:53,200
but also we have some fresh off the

757
00:24:53,200 --> 00:24:54,320
press results

758
00:24:54,320 --> 00:24:57,200
from what enforcement looked like in the

759
00:24:57,200 --> 00:24:58,159
first two weeks

760
00:24:58,159 --> 00:25:00,240
after the law was passed what it looked

761
00:25:00,240 --> 00:25:01,760
like six months later

762
00:25:01,760 --> 00:25:03,600
and what it looked like a year later

763
00:25:03,600 --> 00:25:07,200
meaning in the last couple of weeks

764
00:25:07,200 --> 00:25:10,400
what we see is that only about

765
00:25:10,400 --> 00:25:13,440
eight percent of websites have banners

766
00:25:13,440 --> 00:25:14,960
like the cookie banners you see in

767
00:25:14,960 --> 00:25:16,799
europe

768
00:25:16,799 --> 00:25:20,159
80 of websites just have a link

769
00:25:20,159 --> 00:25:22,000
and some of the websites don't even have

770
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:23,360
that maybe they have a link on their

771
00:25:23,360 --> 00:25:24,400
privacy policy

772
00:25:24,400 --> 00:25:25,760
remember the link was required to be on

773
00:25:25,760 --> 00:25:29,120
the homepage or maybe nothing at all

774
00:25:29,120 --> 00:25:32,400
and to make this worse a lot of links

775
00:25:32,400 --> 00:25:33,840
are not visible

776
00:25:33,840 --> 00:25:35,840
here at the very bottom in the dark

777
00:25:35,840 --> 00:25:37,520
color you'll forgiven if you can't see

778
00:25:37,520 --> 00:25:37,760
it

779
00:25:37,760 --> 00:25:40,640
it's really small it's under 2 you see

780
00:25:40,640 --> 00:25:42,000
the number of

781
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:44,480
links that are actually visible when you

782
00:25:44,480 --> 00:25:46,400
initially visit the page

783
00:25:46,400 --> 00:25:48,720
the vast majority of links are only

784
00:25:48,720 --> 00:25:50,559
visible after you scroll down to the

785
00:25:50,559 --> 00:25:52,080
bottom of the page

786
00:25:52,080 --> 00:25:54,720
and a small increasing number of links

787
00:25:54,720 --> 00:25:56,000
like the buzzfeed one

788
00:25:56,000 --> 00:25:58,400
are only visible after you click on some

789
00:25:58,400 --> 00:25:59,039
menu

790
00:25:59,039 --> 00:26:00,799
or expand some sort of clickable

791
00:26:00,799 --> 00:26:02,799
interactive element and sometimes

792
00:26:02,799 --> 00:26:07,120
do that and scroll to the bottom as well

793
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:09,520
so you could ask yourself how bad that

794
00:26:09,520 --> 00:26:11,520
is and we ran a user study to figure out

795
00:26:11,520 --> 00:26:12,559
how bad that is

796
00:26:12,559 --> 00:26:14,880
we built a website we had a version of

797
00:26:14,880 --> 00:26:16,799
this website that just had links

798
00:26:16,799 --> 00:26:18,559
and then we had a version with banners

799
00:26:18,559 --> 00:26:20,480
because prior work says that

800
00:26:20,480 --> 00:26:22,559
different banner locations have impact

801
00:26:22,559 --> 00:26:23,600
in terms of

802
00:26:23,600 --> 00:26:25,919
exactly what the opt-out rates are we

803
00:26:25,919 --> 00:26:27,039
had lots of different versions of

804
00:26:27,039 --> 00:26:28,640
banners banners at the top banners at

805
00:26:28,640 --> 00:26:30,000
the bottom banners in the corners

806
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:32,480
banners in the middle

807
00:26:32,480 --> 00:26:35,279
and then we put this website up and ran

808
00:26:35,279 --> 00:26:36,960
a google ads campaign to get a bunch of

809
00:26:36,960 --> 00:26:40,240
users and watched what they did

810
00:26:40,240 --> 00:26:43,279
and what we saw was that for the banner

811
00:26:43,279 --> 00:26:44,640
versions

812
00:26:44,640 --> 00:26:47,760
about 15 to 18 percent of our users were

813
00:26:47,760 --> 00:26:48,559
choosing to opt

814
00:26:48,559 --> 00:26:52,080
out but for the link only versions

815
00:26:52,080 --> 00:26:55,120
you're down under two percent this is a

816
00:26:55,120 --> 00:26:56,480
real difference between

817
00:26:56,480 --> 00:26:58,880
the opt-out rates we're seeing for ccpa

818
00:26:58,880 --> 00:27:02,320
and for things like gdpr

819
00:27:04,320 --> 00:27:06,559
it actually gets worse we ran a version

820
00:27:06,559 --> 00:27:08,159
of this with users that we recruited

821
00:27:08,159 --> 00:27:09,440
from mechanical turk

822
00:27:09,440 --> 00:27:11,600
instead of through ads so that we could

823
00:27:11,600 --> 00:27:13,919
ask them some follow-up questions

824
00:27:13,919 --> 00:27:15,279
and there were some interesting results

825
00:27:15,279 --> 00:27:17,120
here in particular we discovered that

826
00:27:17,120 --> 00:27:19,919
45 and a half percent of the users who

827
00:27:19,919 --> 00:27:21,919
saw the link only version of the site

828
00:27:21,919 --> 00:27:23,840
weren't even aware that they had an

829
00:27:23,840 --> 00:27:25,760
opportunity or had a right

830
00:27:25,760 --> 00:27:29,360
to opt out of sale their information

831
00:27:29,840 --> 00:27:32,000
so this is disappointing this is not

832
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:33,520
what we wanted this is not what we hoped

833
00:27:33,520 --> 00:27:33,840
for

834
00:27:33,840 --> 00:27:35,200
this is not the sort of privacy

835
00:27:35,200 --> 00:27:37,200
enhancing technology we would like to

836
00:27:37,200 --> 00:27:40,799
see as a result of legal regulation

837
00:27:41,520 --> 00:27:43,279
and that's just to click on the link

838
00:27:43,279 --> 00:27:44,640
there's a bunch of stuff about what

839
00:27:44,640 --> 00:27:45,200
happens

840
00:27:45,200 --> 00:27:47,840
after you click on a link some cases

841
00:27:47,840 --> 00:27:49,120
there's a single button

842
00:27:49,120 --> 00:27:50,720
just to opt out of sale of personal

843
00:27:50,720 --> 00:27:52,480
information although the interest of

844
00:27:52,480 --> 00:27:53,360
full disclosure

845
00:27:53,360 --> 00:27:55,600
this particular single button shows up

846
00:27:55,600 --> 00:27:56,960
after a whole bunch of text and you have

847
00:27:56,960 --> 00:27:58,240
to scroll down to see it

848
00:27:58,240 --> 00:28:00,880
if you do click on it a follow-up alert

849
00:28:00,880 --> 00:28:02,799
comes up that says are you sure you mean

850
00:28:02,799 --> 00:28:04,720
that

851
00:28:04,720 --> 00:28:07,840
you also see versions with two options

852
00:28:07,840 --> 00:28:09,279
often toggles but there are other

853
00:28:09,279 --> 00:28:11,840
versions as well see versions with more

854
00:28:11,840 --> 00:28:12,559
options

855
00:28:12,559 --> 00:28:14,559
lots of different purposes or people

856
00:28:14,559 --> 00:28:15,679
they sell things to

857
00:28:15,679 --> 00:28:18,080
or even more different options you'll

858
00:28:18,080 --> 00:28:18,960
also see

859
00:28:18,960 --> 00:28:20,320
forms where you have to fill out

860
00:28:20,320 --> 00:28:22,240
personal information in order to opt out

861
00:28:22,240 --> 00:28:24,960
of the sale of your personal information

862
00:28:24,960 --> 00:28:27,760
and instructions for sending someone an

863
00:28:27,760 --> 00:28:28,399
email

864
00:28:28,399 --> 00:28:30,799
or changing your account settings or

865
00:28:30,799 --> 00:28:32,399
changing your browser settings

866
00:28:32,399 --> 00:28:35,600
and things like that the interest of not

867
00:28:35,600 --> 00:28:37,279
going over my allotted time i'm not

868
00:28:37,279 --> 00:28:38,720
going to go into a lot of detail about

869
00:28:38,720 --> 00:28:40,480
exactly what we saw here

870
00:28:40,480 --> 00:28:42,880
we did see the sorts of things where

871
00:28:42,880 --> 00:28:44,720
maybe not the most privacy enhancing

872
00:28:44,720 --> 00:28:45,520
design

873
00:28:45,520 --> 00:28:47,039
it's been a lot of work on nudging and

874
00:28:47,039 --> 00:28:49,039
dark patterns and by other people that's

875
00:28:49,039 --> 00:28:50,080
really awesome

876
00:28:50,080 --> 00:28:51,520
we're going to see a lot of nudging and

877
00:28:51,520 --> 00:28:54,240
dark patterns in this context as well

878
00:28:54,240 --> 00:28:57,440
as you might expect simpler you can get

879
00:28:57,440 --> 00:28:58,960
one button opt out only it's gonna have

880
00:28:58,960 --> 00:29:00,960
the highest opt out rate

881
00:29:00,960 --> 00:29:03,039
two buttons lower than that if you use

882
00:29:03,039 --> 00:29:04,960
nudging highlighting and other things it

883
00:29:04,960 --> 00:29:06,240
goes down a bit

884
00:29:06,240 --> 00:29:08,240
to make it more inconvenient multiple

885
00:29:08,240 --> 00:29:09,840
options or require a form

886
00:29:09,840 --> 00:29:12,640
it goes down even more i don't want to

887
00:29:12,640 --> 00:29:14,399
run too far over time so i'll just give

888
00:29:14,399 --> 00:29:14,799
you the

889
00:29:14,799 --> 00:29:18,480
tldr disappointing

890
00:29:18,480 --> 00:29:22,559
but not actually that surprising

891
00:29:22,880 --> 00:29:26,399
so where does that leave us

892
00:29:26,399 --> 00:29:28,559
what we're seeing is that there are a

893
00:29:28,559 --> 00:29:30,399
lot of steps individual websites can

894
00:29:30,399 --> 00:29:32,559
take in order to enhance privacy

895
00:29:32,559 --> 00:29:33,919
and so if you're running a website and

896
00:29:33,919 --> 00:29:36,320
you care about privacy you can do

897
00:29:36,320 --> 00:29:38,320
pretty well just by designing and

898
00:29:38,320 --> 00:29:39,679
implementing something that works for

899
00:29:39,679 --> 00:29:41,679
typical users

900
00:29:41,679 --> 00:29:43,200
there's also probably room for a lot of

901
00:29:43,200 --> 00:29:45,440
space to develop privacy enhancing tools

902
00:29:45,440 --> 00:29:48,080
that can complement legal regulations so

903
00:29:48,080 --> 00:29:49,679
for people who work in privacy and

904
00:29:49,679 --> 00:29:51,279
enhancing technologies this is probably

905
00:29:51,279 --> 00:29:52,799
great for a lot of us

906
00:29:52,799 --> 00:29:54,559
in follow-up work one of my students and

907
00:29:54,559 --> 00:29:56,640
i have implemented a browser extension

908
00:29:56,640 --> 00:29:57,039
that

909
00:29:57,039 --> 00:29:59,360
automatically detects links and converts

910
00:29:59,360 --> 00:30:00,080
them into

911
00:30:00,080 --> 00:30:02,159
banners so if cookie banners are

912
00:30:02,159 --> 00:30:03,600
everything you ever wanted in life

913
00:30:03,600 --> 00:30:05,440
which i really hope they're not but if

914
00:30:05,440 --> 00:30:06,880
cookie banners are everything you ever

915
00:30:06,880 --> 00:30:08,080
wanted in life

916
00:30:08,080 --> 00:30:09,919
then this is the browser extension for

917
00:30:09,919 --> 00:30:12,000
you

918
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:13,840
you can also think about what are the

919
00:30:13,840 --> 00:30:16,080
higher level takeaways

920
00:30:16,080 --> 00:30:17,919
we've been looking a lot as a community

921
00:30:17,919 --> 00:30:19,200
at gdpr

922
00:30:19,200 --> 00:30:20,799
from this work and some other work by

923
00:30:20,799 --> 00:30:23,679
other groups so i'm looking at ccpa

924
00:30:23,679 --> 00:30:25,360
there are lots of other regulations

925
00:30:25,360 --> 00:30:26,960
around the world and in the united

926
00:30:26,960 --> 00:30:27,760
states

927
00:30:27,760 --> 00:30:29,679
both ones that have been in action for a

928
00:30:29,679 --> 00:30:31,760
while and ones that have just gone into

929
00:30:31,760 --> 00:30:32,640
enforcement

930
00:30:32,640 --> 00:30:33,520
ones that are coming through the

931
00:30:33,520 --> 00:30:34,880
pipeline and ones that are under

932
00:30:34,880 --> 00:30:37,200
discussion now

933
00:30:37,200 --> 00:30:39,360
so

934
00:30:43,039 --> 00:30:46,399
we need robust enforcement mechanisms

935
00:30:46,399 --> 00:30:48,799
we need to talk about more than just

936
00:30:48,799 --> 00:30:50,480
requiring a link we are learning of

937
00:30:50,480 --> 00:30:52,240
different players going abroad players

938
00:30:52,240 --> 00:30:53,360
who don't really have

939
00:30:53,360 --> 00:30:55,279
great resumes within major league soccer

940
00:30:55,279 --> 00:30:56,640
but they're banking on their potential

941
00:30:56,640 --> 00:30:57,760
you gotta stop there

942
00:30:57,760 --> 00:30:59,200
talk about potential you know who saw

943
00:30:59,200 --> 00:31:01,200
potential name davos swinney the uh the

944
00:31:01,200 --> 00:31:02,559
clemson head coach

945
00:31:02,559 --> 00:31:04,960
okay

946
00:31:07,679 --> 00:31:10,720
watching sports right now okay

947
00:31:10,720 --> 00:31:14,080
um they seem to have muted okay

948
00:31:14,080 --> 00:31:16,559
so we have one more talk how to go it

949
00:31:16,559 --> 00:31:18,399
promises to be an interesting one we

950
00:31:18,399 --> 00:31:19,840
have martin klepman who's going to talk

951
00:31:19,840 --> 00:31:21,120
about

952
00:31:21,120 --> 00:31:24,399
cryptographic backdoors

953
00:31:24,399 --> 00:31:27,679
so take it away martin hello everyone

954
00:31:27,679 --> 00:31:28,159
just

955
00:31:28,159 --> 00:31:33,440
let me share my screen

956
00:31:33,440 --> 00:31:36,320
okay can you see that

957
00:31:39,440 --> 00:31:41,200
yes we can see that yes okay and we can

958
00:31:41,200 --> 00:31:42,559
create

959
00:31:42,559 --> 00:31:45,279
um yes so this is probably going to

960
00:31:45,279 --> 00:31:48,480
upset a lot of people in this community

961
00:31:48,480 --> 00:31:50,399
maybe a bit controversial but i'm really

962
00:31:50,399 --> 00:31:52,640
interested to see what the discussion is

963
00:31:52,640 --> 00:31:53,760
after this

964
00:31:53,760 --> 00:31:56,320
so um you know we've heard the story a

965
00:31:56,320 --> 00:31:58,240
million times before

966
00:31:58,240 --> 00:32:00,240
law enforcement and various politicians

967
00:32:00,240 --> 00:32:02,240
say it's terrible that we have these

968
00:32:02,240 --> 00:32:04,159
systems that are end-to-end encrypted

969
00:32:04,159 --> 00:32:06,240
because terrorists are going to use it

970
00:32:06,240 --> 00:32:09,039
uh child abusers are going to use it and

971
00:32:09,039 --> 00:32:09,840
it means

972
00:32:09,840 --> 00:32:11,600
we can't do our work and we have to

973
00:32:11,600 --> 00:32:12,960
weaken these end-to-end

974
00:32:12,960 --> 00:32:15,919
security uh secure systems to which of

975
00:32:15,919 --> 00:32:16,320
course

976
00:32:16,320 --> 00:32:18,240
the uh response of the information

977
00:32:18,240 --> 00:32:20,000
security community is no

978
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:22,000
we must never do that security is bad

979
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:23,279
enough as it is even without

980
00:32:23,279 --> 00:32:24,960
deliberately weakening it

981
00:32:24,960 --> 00:32:27,039
or maybe even saying well cryptography

982
00:32:27,039 --> 00:32:28,480
is just math and you can't

983
00:32:28,480 --> 00:32:31,360
ban mathematics um whatever the

984
00:32:31,360 --> 00:32:33,039
arguments are i'm not going to rehash

985
00:32:33,039 --> 00:32:34,720
them all because you've all heard them a

986
00:32:34,720 --> 00:32:36,480
million times before

987
00:32:36,480 --> 00:32:38,799
what i will observe is that well my

988
00:32:38,799 --> 00:32:40,559
personal opinion

989
00:32:40,559 --> 00:32:42,799
is that saying something like

990
00:32:42,799 --> 00:32:44,559
cryptography is just math is not going

991
00:32:44,559 --> 00:32:46,320
to be very helpful because this is

992
00:32:46,320 --> 00:32:47,519
essentially saying

993
00:32:47,519 --> 00:32:49,840
we can ignore whatever laws are passed

994
00:32:49,840 --> 00:32:51,919
around regulating cryptography

995
00:32:51,919 --> 00:32:53,919
um because you know people can just

996
00:32:53,919 --> 00:32:56,399
implement it themselves if they want

997
00:32:56,399 --> 00:32:57,679
which i don't think is really true

998
00:32:57,679 --> 00:32:59,840
because in the end the authors of

999
00:32:59,840 --> 00:33:01,919
software are subject to the

1000
00:33:01,919 --> 00:33:04,399
laws of the jurisdictions in which they

1001
00:33:04,399 --> 00:33:04,960
live

1002
00:33:04,960 --> 00:33:06,399
the same is true of the users of the

1003
00:33:06,399 --> 00:33:07,840
software the same is true of the

1004
00:33:07,840 --> 00:33:09,200
providers of the servers that the

1005
00:33:09,200 --> 00:33:10,080
software uses

1006
00:33:10,080 --> 00:33:12,399
and so on so so software is

1007
00:33:12,399 --> 00:33:14,000
fundamentally still

1008
00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:16,960
subject to laws in various jurisdictions

1009
00:33:16,960 --> 00:33:17,600
of course

1010
00:33:17,600 --> 00:33:20,720
if bad laws and bad regulations are

1011
00:33:20,720 --> 00:33:22,960
proposed we should and we can and should

1012
00:33:22,960 --> 00:33:25,440
campaign against those but i think

1013
00:33:25,440 --> 00:33:27,200
simply ignoring it and simply being

1014
00:33:27,200 --> 00:33:28,960
stubborn is not going to work

1015
00:33:28,960 --> 00:33:31,039
i think it is going to be more

1016
00:33:31,039 --> 00:33:32,240
productive

1017
00:33:32,240 --> 00:33:33,600
if the information security

1018
00:33:33,600 --> 00:33:35,200
constructively engages with law

1019
00:33:35,200 --> 00:33:36,240
enforcement

1020
00:33:36,240 --> 00:33:38,000
and at least explores whether there's a

1021
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:40,159
middle ground that we can find

1022
00:33:40,159 --> 00:33:42,640
where law enforcement can do their work

1023
00:33:42,640 --> 00:33:44,000
uh within the

1024
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:47,120
realm of uh protecting civil liberties

1025
00:33:47,120 --> 00:33:49,760
and at the same time uh the vast

1026
00:33:49,760 --> 00:33:50,960
majority of

1027
00:33:50,960 --> 00:33:52,799
users who are using technologies for

1028
00:33:52,799 --> 00:33:54,159
honest purposes

1029
00:33:54,159 --> 00:33:57,760
can enjoy privacy so right now the way

1030
00:33:57,760 --> 00:33:59,360
that law enforcement gets around

1031
00:33:59,360 --> 00:34:01,279
end-to-end encryption in systems is well

1032
00:34:01,279 --> 00:34:03,279
either they use zero days to get roots

1033
00:34:03,279 --> 00:34:05,039
uh on the device and then of course they

1034
00:34:05,039 --> 00:34:06,799
can do anything

1035
00:34:06,799 --> 00:34:09,679
or one of the new ideas is to have a

1036
00:34:09,679 --> 00:34:11,199
concept of ghost users

1037
00:34:11,199 --> 00:34:15,040
where rather than a cryptographic

1038
00:34:15,040 --> 00:34:16,639
communication secure communication

1039
00:34:16,639 --> 00:34:18,560
between two users the

1040
00:34:18,560 --> 00:34:21,359
intelligence agency gets added as a uh

1041
00:34:21,359 --> 00:34:22,000
secret

1042
00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:24,079
extra end to the end-to-end

1043
00:34:24,079 --> 00:34:25,280
communication

1044
00:34:25,280 --> 00:34:27,918
um of course these are both terrible in

1045
00:34:27,918 --> 00:34:29,440
terms of security because

1046
00:34:29,440 --> 00:34:32,399
they are they they're totally

1047
00:34:32,399 --> 00:34:34,239
unaccountable there's no way of

1048
00:34:34,239 --> 00:34:36,239
figuring out whether the way that law

1049
00:34:36,239 --> 00:34:38,719
enforcement is using these capabilities

1050
00:34:38,719 --> 00:34:40,800
is actually in line with the law and

1051
00:34:40,800 --> 00:34:42,159
there's no way of knowing whether they

1052
00:34:42,159 --> 00:34:43,280
are used only in

1053
00:34:43,280 --> 00:34:46,000
specific cases or for mass surveillance

1054
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:46,800
so

1055
00:34:46,800 --> 00:34:49,040
i think what a better approach would be

1056
00:34:49,040 --> 00:34:50,399
is to say

1057
00:34:50,399 --> 00:34:52,719
actually we can have a backdoor in enter

1058
00:34:52,719 --> 00:34:54,239
and encrypted systems

1059
00:34:54,239 --> 00:34:57,280
as long as this backdoor has safeguards

1060
00:34:57,280 --> 00:34:58,720
built around it and those safeguards are

1061
00:34:58,720 --> 00:35:00,480
both technical and legal

1062
00:35:00,480 --> 00:35:02,960
uh to ensure that it cannot be abused at

1063
00:35:02,960 --> 00:35:04,880
least not without being noticed

1064
00:35:04,880 --> 00:35:06,720
so in particular what we want to do

1065
00:35:06,720 --> 00:35:08,960
there is prevent this being used for

1066
00:35:08,960 --> 00:35:10,880
mass surveillance

1067
00:35:10,880 --> 00:35:13,359
and so here's a proposal of a type of

1068
00:35:13,359 --> 00:35:14,320
backdoor that

1069
00:35:14,320 --> 00:35:17,119
i think would achieve this uh it's quite

1070
00:35:17,119 --> 00:35:17,599
simple

1071
00:35:17,599 --> 00:35:19,920
i um i think it's fairly straightforward

1072
00:35:19,920 --> 00:35:21,359
although i haven't actually seen it

1073
00:35:21,359 --> 00:35:23,200
proposed anywhere before

1074
00:35:23,200 --> 00:35:25,280
it's entirely possible though that i've

1075
00:35:25,280 --> 00:35:27,440
missed it somebody else's proposal

1076
00:35:27,440 --> 00:35:28,640
previously

1077
00:35:28,640 --> 00:35:30,160
so we start with a law enforcement

1078
00:35:30,160 --> 00:35:31,760
agency uh who

1079
00:35:31,760 --> 00:35:33,599
to go through the usual legal process

1080
00:35:33,599 --> 00:35:35,119
they have some case where they

1081
00:35:35,119 --> 00:35:37,440
want to investigate a subject they go to

1082
00:35:37,440 --> 00:35:38,320
a judge

1083
00:35:38,320 --> 00:35:41,760
or suitable um authority and

1084
00:35:41,760 --> 00:35:43,760
they get a warrant or subpoena or

1085
00:35:43,760 --> 00:35:45,599
something along those lines which

1086
00:35:45,599 --> 00:35:48,800
gives them the authority to request some

1087
00:35:48,800 --> 00:35:50,079
plain text of some encrypted

1088
00:35:50,079 --> 00:35:51,200
communications

1089
00:35:51,200 --> 00:35:52,400
with that they go to the service

1090
00:35:52,400 --> 00:35:53,920
provider so this would be facebook in

1091
00:35:53,920 --> 00:35:55,440
the case of whatsapp

1092
00:35:55,440 --> 00:35:58,000
and now here comes the proposal so the

1093
00:35:58,000 --> 00:35:59,520
service provider maintains

1094
00:35:59,520 --> 00:36:01,680
a transparency log very much like

1095
00:36:01,680 --> 00:36:03,839
certificate transparency

1096
00:36:03,839 --> 00:36:06,000
and all of the entries in this log are

1097
00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:07,760
totally public anyone can see

1098
00:36:07,760 --> 00:36:10,720
what they are when the service provider

1099
00:36:10,720 --> 00:36:12,880
receives a warrant

1100
00:36:12,880 --> 00:36:15,680
they add a new entry to this log the

1101
00:36:15,680 --> 00:36:16,480
details of this

1102
00:36:16,480 --> 00:36:19,520
entry i'll explain in a moment and this

1103
00:36:19,520 --> 00:36:19,920
log

1104
00:36:19,920 --> 00:36:23,440
is now read and followed by

1105
00:36:23,440 --> 00:36:25,200
anyone can do it but i'm going to assume

1106
00:36:25,200 --> 00:36:26,880
that some

1107
00:36:26,880 --> 00:36:29,200
in organizations that promote civil

1108
00:36:29,200 --> 00:36:30,079
liberties

1109
00:36:30,079 --> 00:36:33,040
such as the aclu and others they will

1110
00:36:33,040 --> 00:36:35,119
act as auditors of this log and they

1111
00:36:35,119 --> 00:36:35,680
will

1112
00:36:35,680 --> 00:36:37,440
track it and they will report summary

1113
00:36:37,440 --> 00:36:39,520
statistics to the public

1114
00:36:39,520 --> 00:36:41,760
in order to let the public know what's

1115
00:36:41,760 --> 00:36:42,640
what is happening

1116
00:36:42,640 --> 00:36:45,119
what what sort of warrants are being

1117
00:36:45,119 --> 00:36:47,680
served on the service provider

1118
00:36:47,680 --> 00:36:49,280
so let's look at the contents of one of

1119
00:36:49,280 --> 00:36:51,520
those log records

1120
00:36:51,520 --> 00:36:53,440
so i suggest that the content should be

1121
00:36:53,440 --> 00:36:54,800
first of all the jurisdiction of the

1122
00:36:54,800 --> 00:36:56,000
warrant

1123
00:36:56,000 --> 00:36:58,160
that's very important to know from which

1124
00:36:58,160 --> 00:37:00,000
jurisdictions the service providers

1125
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:01,680
accepting warrants

1126
00:37:01,680 --> 00:37:03,359
because you know a warrant coming from

1127
00:37:03,359 --> 00:37:05,200
the us is not going to be the same as a

1128
00:37:05,200 --> 00:37:07,040
warrant coming from say the saudi

1129
00:37:07,040 --> 00:37:08,480
arabian government or something like

1130
00:37:08,480 --> 00:37:09,280
that

1131
00:37:09,280 --> 00:37:11,200
then secondly a code indicating the

1132
00:37:11,200 --> 00:37:13,280
reason for this warrant which might be

1133
00:37:13,280 --> 00:37:15,200
terrorism or child sexual

1134
00:37:15,200 --> 00:37:18,000
sexual abuse or whatever it is validity

1135
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:19,440
start and end date

1136
00:37:19,440 --> 00:37:21,839
and then it does not contain the target

1137
00:37:21,839 --> 00:37:23,680
of the warrant but instead

1138
00:37:23,680 --> 00:37:26,400
it contains a cryptographic commitment

1139
00:37:26,400 --> 00:37:29,040
to the device id that is the subject of

1140
00:37:29,040 --> 00:37:30,160
this warrant

1141
00:37:30,160 --> 00:37:32,240
and so this means anyone who's just

1142
00:37:32,240 --> 00:37:33,920
reading the log publicly can see that

1143
00:37:33,920 --> 00:37:35,440
there is a warrant but they can't see

1144
00:37:35,440 --> 00:37:37,599
who the target of the warrant is

1145
00:37:37,599 --> 00:37:39,680
however it is possible for the service

1146
00:37:39,680 --> 00:37:41,359
provider to reveal

1147
00:37:41,359 --> 00:37:43,920
this cryptographic commitment in order

1148
00:37:43,920 --> 00:37:44,400
to show

1149
00:37:44,400 --> 00:37:47,200
that a particular device id is in fact

1150
00:37:47,200 --> 00:37:48,800
the target of this warrant

1151
00:37:48,800 --> 00:37:52,000
and importantly a particular log entry

1152
00:37:52,000 --> 00:37:55,760
can have only a single target

1153
00:37:56,560 --> 00:37:59,200
now in order to activate this backdoor

1154
00:37:59,200 --> 00:38:00,079
what happens

1155
00:38:00,079 --> 00:38:01,920
is that after the service providers

1156
00:38:01,920 --> 00:38:04,640
appended this entry to the log

1157
00:38:04,640 --> 00:38:07,280
they now send a message to the device of

1158
00:38:07,280 --> 00:38:08,720
the target user

1159
00:38:08,720 --> 00:38:10,560
the target user who should be

1160
00:38:10,560 --> 00:38:12,000
investigated

1161
00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:15,280
they send the log entry they reveal

1162
00:38:15,280 --> 00:38:17,599
the the cryptographic commitment for the

1163
00:38:17,599 --> 00:38:19,920
device id to prove that their device id

1164
00:38:19,920 --> 00:38:22,000
is the one in the log entry and they

1165
00:38:22,000 --> 00:38:24,000
include a cryptographic proof of

1166
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:25,599
the fact that this log entry is in fact

1167
00:38:25,599 --> 00:38:27,040
included in the log

1168
00:38:27,040 --> 00:38:29,440
and the target user device checks this

1169
00:38:29,440 --> 00:38:30,320
silently

1170
00:38:30,320 --> 00:38:32,079
and if it all checks out and it's all

1171
00:38:32,079 --> 00:38:34,160
correct then the user device simply

1172
00:38:34,160 --> 00:38:35,520
takes a copy of whatever

1173
00:38:35,520 --> 00:38:38,160
user data is on the device right now and

1174
00:38:38,160 --> 00:38:39,040
uploads that

1175
00:38:39,040 --> 00:38:41,119
to somewhere where the law enforcement

1176
00:38:41,119 --> 00:38:42,480
agency can access it

1177
00:38:42,480 --> 00:38:44,240
and this upload continues until the

1178
00:38:44,240 --> 00:38:46,240
expiry date of the warrant and then it

1179
00:38:46,240 --> 00:38:47,599
stops

1180
00:38:47,599 --> 00:38:51,119
and so the the key idea here is

1181
00:38:51,119 --> 00:38:53,599
that anyone can see the number of

1182
00:38:53,599 --> 00:38:55,040
warrants that are being issued

1183
00:38:55,040 --> 00:38:57,440
because you can only have a single

1184
00:38:57,440 --> 00:38:59,520
device targeted for each

1185
00:38:59,520 --> 00:39:03,040
for each entry in the log the

1186
00:39:03,040 --> 00:39:05,040
one extra thing we can add here in order

1187
00:39:05,040 --> 00:39:06,800
to improve our confidence that this is

1188
00:39:06,800 --> 00:39:08,240
being done legally

1189
00:39:08,240 --> 00:39:09,920
is that there's a trusted oversight

1190
00:39:09,920 --> 00:39:11,359
board

1191
00:39:11,359 --> 00:39:13,920
which checks every entry that the

1192
00:39:13,920 --> 00:39:15,839
service provider adds to the log

1193
00:39:15,839 --> 00:39:18,000
and the service provider also gives a

1194
00:39:18,000 --> 00:39:19,760
copy of the warrant to this trusted

1195
00:39:19,760 --> 00:39:20,640
oversight

1196
00:39:20,640 --> 00:39:22,560
board and the board checks that the

1197
00:39:22,560 --> 00:39:23,920
warrant is genuine and

1198
00:39:23,920 --> 00:39:26,720
is legal according to the laws of the

1199
00:39:26,720 --> 00:39:28,240
jurisdiction in which this is all

1200
00:39:28,240 --> 00:39:29,760
happening

1201
00:39:29,760 --> 00:39:31,760
so uploading a plain text copy of your

1202
00:39:31,760 --> 00:39:33,040
data sounds like

1203
00:39:33,040 --> 00:39:35,520
a ridiculous proposition but this is in

1204
00:39:35,520 --> 00:39:37,280
fact exactly what a lot of

1205
00:39:37,280 --> 00:39:39,440
uh end-to-end encrypted messaging apps

1206
00:39:39,440 --> 00:39:41,760
in fact do already so for example

1207
00:39:41,760 --> 00:39:44,640
whatsapp and imessage have this cloud

1208
00:39:44,640 --> 00:39:45,839
backup feature

1209
00:39:45,839 --> 00:39:49,040
uh in which you know or the entire point

1210
00:39:49,040 --> 00:39:49,440
of the

1211
00:39:49,440 --> 00:39:51,440
enter encryption is entire is is really

1212
00:39:51,440 --> 00:39:53,599
undermined by just taking a copy of your

1213
00:39:53,599 --> 00:39:54,400
messages

1214
00:39:54,400 --> 00:39:56,640
and uploading them in plain text to a

1215
00:39:56,640 --> 00:39:58,240
server

1216
00:39:58,240 --> 00:40:00,000
so the only effect of this backdoor is

1217
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:01,520
essentially that

1218
00:40:01,520 --> 00:40:04,240
if the user has disabled these cloud

1219
00:40:04,240 --> 00:40:05,200
backups

1220
00:40:05,200 --> 00:40:07,119
then activating the backdoor means the

1221
00:40:07,119 --> 00:40:10,160
backups get silently re-enabled

1222
00:40:10,160 --> 00:40:11,359
let's talk briefly about the

1223
00:40:11,359 --> 00:40:13,920
characteristics of this proposed scheme

1224
00:40:13,920 --> 00:40:16,960
so first of all i think

1225
00:40:16,960 --> 00:40:18,400
mass surveillance would be very

1226
00:40:18,400 --> 00:40:20,800
difficult to conduct using this system

1227
00:40:20,800 --> 00:40:22,880
because it would result in millions of

1228
00:40:22,880 --> 00:40:24,160
log entries and

1229
00:40:24,160 --> 00:40:25,920
so this would be immediately obvious to

1230
00:40:25,920 --> 00:40:27,760
anyone who's tracking the log

1231
00:40:27,760 --> 00:40:30,160
um that there is mass surveillance going

1232
00:40:30,160 --> 00:40:31,280
on so it doesn't

1233
00:40:31,280 --> 00:40:33,119
prevent it but it means that mass

1234
00:40:33,119 --> 00:40:34,480
surveillance would be immediately

1235
00:40:34,480 --> 00:40:36,000
discovered and would be subject to

1236
00:40:36,000 --> 00:40:37,359
public debate

1237
00:40:37,359 --> 00:40:40,079
um in the scheme there is no p escrow

1238
00:40:40,079 --> 00:40:42,000
there's no golden master key that can

1239
00:40:42,000 --> 00:40:42,400
encrypt

1240
00:40:42,400 --> 00:40:45,200
that can decrypt everything uh so all of

1241
00:40:45,200 --> 00:40:46,800
the problems that would come

1242
00:40:46,800 --> 00:40:48,800
with having such a master key simply go

1243
00:40:48,800 --> 00:40:50,400
away there's no change to the actual

1244
00:40:50,400 --> 00:40:52,640
cryptography the the protocol is really

1245
00:40:52,640 --> 00:40:53,440
simple actually

1246
00:40:53,440 --> 00:40:55,599
so you can explain it to people who are

1247
00:40:55,599 --> 00:40:56,480
not very

1248
00:40:56,480 --> 00:40:58,079
technically sophisticated and they will

1249
00:40:58,079 --> 00:40:59,920
still be able to understand it

1250
00:40:59,920 --> 00:41:02,880
um one characteristic of this protocol

1251
00:41:02,880 --> 00:41:04,480
is also that if something is deleted

1252
00:41:04,480 --> 00:41:06,160
from the device by the time the backdoor

1253
00:41:06,160 --> 00:41:07,280
is activated

1254
00:41:07,280 --> 00:41:08,880
then the law enforcement does not get a

1255
00:41:08,880 --> 00:41:11,280
copy of that data that has been deleted

1256
00:41:11,280 --> 00:41:14,160
i think that's reasonable because uh if

1257
00:41:14,160 --> 00:41:15,839
the law enforcement agency went and

1258
00:41:15,839 --> 00:41:18,319
physically seized the device instead

1259
00:41:18,319 --> 00:41:20,079
they would also not get a copy of any

1260
00:41:20,079 --> 00:41:21,839
data that has been deleted so

1261
00:41:21,839 --> 00:41:23,119
what they're getting with this backdoor

1262
00:41:23,119 --> 00:41:25,040
is equivalent to what they would get

1263
00:41:25,040 --> 00:41:26,800
by physically seizing the device i think

1264
00:41:26,800 --> 00:41:28,720
that's a fair compromise

1265
00:41:28,720 --> 00:41:31,359
um if law enforcement wants to hide the

1266
00:41:31,359 --> 00:41:31,920
fact that

1267
00:41:31,920 --> 00:41:34,319
precisely when these warrants are issued

1268
00:41:34,319 --> 00:41:36,240
you could add fake entries to the log

1269
00:41:36,240 --> 00:41:36,640
and

1270
00:41:36,640 --> 00:41:38,160
publish the log entries on a preset

1271
00:41:38,160 --> 00:41:40,240
schedule in order to

1272
00:41:40,240 --> 00:41:42,000
avoid leading leaking this timing

1273
00:41:42,000 --> 00:41:44,240
information and finally

1274
00:41:44,240 --> 00:41:45,599
as i said earlier i think it's very

1275
00:41:45,599 --> 00:41:47,359
important to make explicit

1276
00:41:47,359 --> 00:41:49,920
which jurisdictions are allowed to or

1277
00:41:49,920 --> 00:41:50,560
are

1278
00:41:50,560 --> 00:41:53,040
are going to be uh have their warrants

1279
00:41:53,040 --> 00:41:53,680
accepted

1280
00:41:53,680 --> 00:41:55,359
by the service provider and which

1281
00:41:55,359 --> 00:41:57,839
jurisdictions will be ignored

1282
00:41:57,839 --> 00:41:59,359
you might now ask well is law

1283
00:41:59,359 --> 00:42:00,880
enforcement going to actually go for a

1284
00:42:00,880 --> 00:42:02,800
scheme like this

1285
00:42:02,800 --> 00:42:05,119
this is a very fair question i did find

1286
00:42:05,119 --> 00:42:06,480
an interesting article

1287
00:42:06,480 --> 00:42:09,440
from two technical directors at gchq

1288
00:42:09,440 --> 00:42:10,640
from a few years ago

1289
00:42:10,640 --> 00:42:14,480
where they argued the principles of what

1290
00:42:14,480 --> 00:42:15,839
what they call exceptional access

1291
00:42:15,839 --> 00:42:18,400
capabilities in other words backdoors

1292
00:42:18,400 --> 00:42:20,560
what capabilities that should have in

1293
00:42:20,560 --> 00:42:21,920
their opinion

1294
00:42:21,920 --> 00:42:23,920
and they said very explicitly they do

1295
00:42:23,920 --> 00:42:25,599
not want key escrow they call

1296
00:42:25,599 --> 00:42:27,680
key escrow catastrophically done

1297
00:42:27,680 --> 00:42:29,520
literally

1298
00:42:29,520 --> 00:42:31,839
so they do not want any mechanism that

1299
00:42:31,839 --> 00:42:33,599
would allow them to decrypt all of the

1300
00:42:33,599 --> 00:42:34,960
communications in bulk

1301
00:42:34,960 --> 00:42:36,880
they specifically want a mechanism that

1302
00:42:36,880 --> 00:42:38,160
can give them access

1303
00:42:38,160 --> 00:42:40,560
only to specifically targeted users and

1304
00:42:40,560 --> 00:42:42,000
not to anybody else

1305
00:42:42,000 --> 00:42:44,800
and secondly they are actually happy

1306
00:42:44,800 --> 00:42:46,480
with this idea of having

1307
00:42:46,480 --> 00:42:49,280
a public audit mechanism that

1308
00:42:49,280 --> 00:42:50,960
demonstrates to the public that the

1309
00:42:50,960 --> 00:42:52,880
backdoor is only being used at a small

1310
00:42:52,880 --> 00:42:53,760
scale

1311
00:42:53,760 --> 00:42:56,160
for a small number of specifically

1312
00:42:56,160 --> 00:42:58,720
targeted suspects and not at large scale

1313
00:42:58,720 --> 00:43:00,560
and so they are actually very happy to

1314
00:43:00,560 --> 00:43:03,040
have this kind of degree of transparency

1315
00:43:03,040 --> 00:43:05,839
that would be implied in the kind of log

1316
00:43:05,839 --> 00:43:07,359
that i suggested

1317
00:43:07,359 --> 00:43:10,400
so that's it essentially i imagine

1318
00:43:10,400 --> 00:43:11,520
there's going to be a lot of

1319
00:43:11,520 --> 00:43:13,280
disagreement with this but i'm very

1320
00:43:13,280 --> 00:43:15,200
curious to hear what folks think about

1321
00:43:15,200 --> 00:43:17,050
this

1322
00:43:17,050 --> 00:43:18,880
[Music]

1323
00:43:18,880 --> 00:43:21,680
okay thank you very much martin let's

1324
00:43:21,680 --> 00:43:24,480
thank all the speakers and we have

1325
00:43:24,480 --> 00:43:27,599
half an hour to discuss i have a feeling

1326
00:43:27,599 --> 00:43:29,280
lots of people will have lots of

1327
00:43:29,280 --> 00:43:36,800
opinions to share so please please
