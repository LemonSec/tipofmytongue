1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,680
all right great uh we're going to start

2
00:00:01,680 --> 00:00:03,360
the town hall now

3
00:00:03,360 --> 00:00:06,319
um uh there will be four of us that will

4
00:00:06,319 --> 00:00:07,919
be talking and then um

5
00:00:07,919 --> 00:00:10,320
taking questions and listening to

6
00:00:10,320 --> 00:00:11,679
everybody's thoughts

7
00:00:11,679 --> 00:00:14,920
um so i'll start us off next slide

8
00:00:14,920 --> 00:00:17,359
please should also explain that bailey

9
00:00:17,359 --> 00:00:18,160
is also here

10
00:00:18,160 --> 00:00:21,760
uh who's uh uh uh

11
00:00:21,760 --> 00:00:24,000
artifact chair for next year yes good

12
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:25,199
point sorry i didn't know you

13
00:00:25,199 --> 00:00:26,480
i didn't push you on the slide bailey

14
00:00:26,480 --> 00:00:28,640
there are five of us here

15
00:00:28,640 --> 00:00:30,000
including baby cats mark who's not a

16
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,320
bachelor next year right

17
00:00:32,320 --> 00:00:35,440
um okay next slide okay uh for those of

18
00:00:35,440 --> 00:00:36,640
you who aren't aware i'll go

19
00:00:36,640 --> 00:00:39,680
um over roughly how pets pope hats is

20
00:00:39,680 --> 00:00:43,280
structured um there's the board a pet

21
00:00:43,280 --> 00:00:44,079
board uh

22
00:00:44,079 --> 00:00:45,680
that chooses the program chairs and

23
00:00:45,680 --> 00:00:47,440
general chairs of

24
00:00:47,440 --> 00:00:49,440
the conference pets and the journal

25
00:00:49,440 --> 00:00:51,120
popets every year

26
00:00:51,120 --> 00:00:53,039
um they also choose some of the other

27
00:00:53,039 --> 00:00:55,199
chairs such as for hot pets

28
00:00:55,199 --> 00:00:57,120
and that board is itself composed of

29
00:00:57,120 --> 00:00:59,840
past program chairs and general chairs

30
00:00:59,840 --> 00:01:02,000
uh and for people that want to uh host

31
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:03,520
pets they submit their

32
00:01:03,520 --> 00:01:05,040
posting proposals to the pet board so

33
00:01:05,040 --> 00:01:06,320
that board also makes the decision of

34
00:01:06,320 --> 00:01:07,439
where to host

35
00:01:07,439 --> 00:01:10,640
pets um

36
00:01:10,640 --> 00:01:12,960
and as you probably know that follows a

37
00:01:12,960 --> 00:01:14,799
hybrid journal conference model where

38
00:01:14,799 --> 00:01:16,400
the papers are published in the popets

39
00:01:16,400 --> 00:01:17,600
journal and then there's a pets

40
00:01:17,600 --> 00:01:19,920
conference which is where we are now

41
00:01:19,920 --> 00:01:22,880
okay next slide please

42
00:01:24,080 --> 00:01:27,119
so here's some information about pet

43
00:01:27,119 --> 00:01:28,720
submissions over time

44
00:01:28,720 --> 00:01:30,560
uh you can see in the left graph the

45
00:01:30,560 --> 00:01:32,799
number of submissions every year

46
00:01:32,799 --> 00:01:35,119
uh which is steadily increased uh this

47
00:01:35,119 --> 00:01:36,960
year we hit 436

48
00:01:36,960 --> 00:01:40,400
submissions which is a 29 increase over

49
00:01:40,400 --> 00:01:41,200
last year

50
00:01:41,200 --> 00:01:43,840
pretty substantial the middle graph

51
00:01:43,840 --> 00:01:45,040
shows

52
00:01:45,040 --> 00:01:46,399
and i thought i had captions the middle

53
00:01:46,399 --> 00:01:48,479
the middle graph shows um

54
00:01:48,479 --> 00:01:51,200
the number of accepted papers um also

55
00:01:51,200 --> 00:01:51,759
growing

56
00:01:51,759 --> 00:01:54,720
uh although not quite as fast to see um

57
00:01:54,720 --> 00:01:56,399
as the submitted papers

58
00:01:56,399 --> 00:01:57,759
and therefore you can see that our uh

59
00:01:57,759 --> 00:01:59,520
acceptance rate um

60
00:01:59,520 --> 00:02:01,600
while roughly staying between you know

61
00:02:01,600 --> 00:02:03,600
15 and 25

62
00:02:03,600 --> 00:02:09,840
um this year hit 19 next slide please

63
00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:13,760
next slide oh yeah i think

64
00:02:13,760 --> 00:02:14,959
i think this is running off of google

65
00:02:14,959 --> 00:02:16,800
drive so it messed up the captions

66
00:02:16,800 --> 00:02:20,560
uh that's my uh previous slide

67
00:02:20,560 --> 00:02:23,599
okay so here are some of the

68
00:02:23,599 --> 00:02:25,840
statistics about the decisions that were

69
00:02:25,840 --> 00:02:26,879
made there are

70
00:02:26,879 --> 00:02:29,440
um five decisions roughly speaking that

71
00:02:29,440 --> 00:02:30,640
pets can give a paper

72
00:02:30,640 --> 00:02:33,519
um except shepherd which is an accept

73
00:02:33,519 --> 00:02:34,080
decision

74
00:02:34,080 --> 00:02:36,080
just asking for some minor revisions

75
00:02:36,080 --> 00:02:38,080
major revisions which asked for

76
00:02:38,080 --> 00:02:41,360
another submission with um updated major

77
00:02:41,360 --> 00:02:42,640
updates to the paper

78
00:02:42,640 --> 00:02:44,319
a reject and resubmit which is a

79
00:02:44,319 --> 00:02:46,080
rejection decision but encourages the

80
00:02:46,080 --> 00:02:47,120
office to try again

81
00:02:47,120 --> 00:02:48,959
and then reject which is also rejection

82
00:02:48,959 --> 00:02:50,800
and doesn't encourage a resubmission of

83
00:02:50,800 --> 00:02:52,800
paper in any form

84
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:56,319
you can see the breakdown of the

85
00:02:56,319 --> 00:02:59,040
fraction of papers uh that receive each

86
00:02:59,040 --> 00:03:01,280
decision this year

87
00:03:01,280 --> 00:03:03,040
about two-thirds of the papers receive

88
00:03:03,040 --> 00:03:05,840
some form of reject decision

89
00:03:05,840 --> 00:03:07,519
although the majority of those i think

90
00:03:07,519 --> 00:03:09,840
it's like two two thirds of that

91
00:03:09,840 --> 00:03:12,640
uh receive a reject and resubmit which

92
00:03:12,640 --> 00:03:14,080
encourages the author to consider

93
00:03:14,080 --> 00:03:16,239
revising and sending a new version

94
00:03:16,239 --> 00:03:19,280
to pets um and about a quarter of the

95
00:03:19,280 --> 00:03:20,159
papers receive

96
00:03:20,159 --> 00:03:22,319
uh a major revisions or twenty percent

97
00:03:22,319 --> 00:03:24,239
receive a major revisions decision

98
00:03:24,239 --> 00:03:27,440
um which is a very um positive decision

99
00:03:27,440 --> 00:03:28,959
actually because most major visions if

100
00:03:28,959 --> 00:03:30,799
we submitted end up getting accepted but

101
00:03:30,799 --> 00:03:31,680
it does require

102
00:03:31,680 --> 00:03:35,120
major changes and another submission

103
00:03:35,120 --> 00:03:37,360
uh and then smaller fractions uh of the

104
00:03:37,360 --> 00:03:38,720
papers around 10

105
00:03:38,720 --> 00:03:43,120
are accepted or shepherded overall

106
00:03:43,519 --> 00:03:45,680
um so you can see for each type of

107
00:03:45,680 --> 00:03:46,799
submission um

108
00:03:46,799 --> 00:03:48,640
their acceptance rates it's a little

109
00:03:48,640 --> 00:03:50,080
hard to see if the captions got

110
00:03:50,080 --> 00:03:51,920
uh affected here but for the new

111
00:03:51,920 --> 00:03:53,360
submissions which are the bar graphs and

112
00:03:53,360 --> 00:03:54,319
left

113
00:03:54,319 --> 00:03:55,840
although only seven and a half percent

114
00:03:55,840 --> 00:03:57,680
of it were accepted

115
00:03:57,680 --> 00:04:00,400
um actually another 20 percent got a

116
00:04:00,400 --> 00:04:01,439
major revision

117
00:04:01,439 --> 00:04:03,840
which is again a very positive decision

118
00:04:03,840 --> 00:04:04,480
um so

119
00:04:04,480 --> 00:04:05,280
while you might think that the

120
00:04:05,280 --> 00:04:06,799
acceptance rate for new papers are quite

121
00:04:06,799 --> 00:04:08,159
low uh you

122
00:04:08,159 --> 00:04:10,720
actually have nearly a 30 chance of

123
00:04:10,720 --> 00:04:11,439
getting

124
00:04:11,439 --> 00:04:13,680
on on the road to acceptance for pence

125
00:04:13,680 --> 00:04:14,799
with the new submission

126
00:04:14,799 --> 00:04:17,120
so it may be better than it first

127
00:04:17,120 --> 00:04:18,560
appears and then you can see that the

128
00:04:18,560 --> 00:04:18,959
next

129
00:04:18,959 --> 00:04:21,279
uh bars which is the major revision

130
00:04:21,279 --> 00:04:22,240
submissions

131
00:04:22,240 --> 00:04:24,080
um what the decisions on those were and

132
00:04:24,080 --> 00:04:26,560
over 85 percent of major revisions

133
00:04:26,560 --> 00:04:29,680
ended up getting accepted or shipped and

134
00:04:29,680 --> 00:04:30,240
then

135
00:04:30,240 --> 00:04:32,720
a small fraction um about a half percent

136
00:04:32,720 --> 00:04:34,160
of major revisions got another major

137
00:04:34,160 --> 00:04:35,680
business decision which we avoid because

138
00:04:35,680 --> 00:04:37,360
we don't want to get into

139
00:04:37,360 --> 00:04:39,759
endless revisions but sometimes if the

140
00:04:39,759 --> 00:04:41,360
authors are making good progress but

141
00:04:41,360 --> 00:04:42,000
they haven't

142
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:44,240
really done what the reviewers were

143
00:04:44,240 --> 00:04:45,280
asking for

144
00:04:45,280 --> 00:04:47,120
uh it's the best edition so we do make

145
00:04:47,120 --> 00:04:48,960
that sometimes um and then there's a

146
00:04:48,960 --> 00:04:50,080
small fraction i think it's like five

147
00:04:50,080 --> 00:04:51,280
percent of major revisions where the

148
00:04:51,280 --> 00:04:52,720
authors just didn't get what the

149
00:04:52,720 --> 00:04:53,919
reviewers were asking for and we decided

150
00:04:53,919 --> 00:04:55,520
to end the process they don't end up

151
00:04:55,520 --> 00:04:57,919
being accepted

152
00:04:57,919 --> 00:05:00,400
uh the last set of bars uh papers that

153
00:05:00,400 --> 00:05:02,560
are reject and resubmit papers

154
00:05:02,560 --> 00:05:06,240
uh for those papers um the acceptance

155
00:05:06,240 --> 00:05:07,840
rates are slightly higher than

156
00:05:07,840 --> 00:05:11,360
for new papers um but it's not really

157
00:05:11,360 --> 00:05:12,639
that high it's nowhere near major

158
00:05:12,639 --> 00:05:13,520
revisions

159
00:05:13,520 --> 00:05:15,120
uh so our observation is that if you get

160
00:05:15,120 --> 00:05:17,280
a rejecting resubmit decision

161
00:05:17,280 --> 00:05:19,680
generally speaking you only have a

162
00:05:19,680 --> 00:05:21,280
slightly higher chance

163
00:05:21,280 --> 00:05:24,240
of getting accepted or major um then if

164
00:05:24,240 --> 00:05:25,680
then the new papers

165
00:05:25,680 --> 00:05:27,199
despite the fact that you got feedback

166
00:05:27,199 --> 00:05:29,919
from the reviewers and you tried again

167
00:05:29,919 --> 00:05:33,039
uh so it's it it is not that positive of

168
00:05:33,039 --> 00:05:33,919
a decision

169
00:05:33,919 --> 00:05:35,919
and uh we have sort of changed our

170
00:05:35,919 --> 00:05:37,280
communication to

171
00:05:37,280 --> 00:05:40,000
authors um this year to reflect that

172
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:40,400
fact

173
00:05:40,400 --> 00:05:44,160
that uh it's uh not a very positive

174
00:05:44,160 --> 00:05:45,840
decision and they need to take the

175
00:05:45,840 --> 00:05:47,600
criticism seriously and make major

176
00:05:47,600 --> 00:05:48,240
efforts

177
00:05:48,240 --> 00:05:50,320
if they want to be in that 15 that gets

178
00:05:50,320 --> 00:05:51,360
accepted

179
00:05:51,360 --> 00:05:55,680
in the next submission next slide

180
00:05:56,319 --> 00:06:00,000
okay for a second i just want to say one

181
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:02,240
conclusion from that i draw from

182
00:06:02,240 --> 00:06:04,240
from the the statistics that aaron just

183
00:06:04,240 --> 00:06:06,160
showed and i apologize for jumping in

184
00:06:06,160 --> 00:06:06,800
here

185
00:06:06,800 --> 00:06:09,039
is that the actual acceptance rate is

186
00:06:09,039 --> 00:06:10,240
much higher

187
00:06:10,240 --> 00:06:13,120
than the acceptance rate that uh in in

188
00:06:13,120 --> 00:06:14,479
the previous graph

189
00:06:14,479 --> 00:06:17,039
uh was shown because a lot of people are

190
00:06:17,039 --> 00:06:18,639
lacking acceptance by going through a

191
00:06:18,639 --> 00:06:20,080
major revision first

192
00:06:20,080 --> 00:06:22,479
and then are accepted in later issues

193
00:06:22,479 --> 00:06:24,479
when hopefully the number of papers have

194
00:06:24,479 --> 00:06:25,520
already risen

195
00:06:25,520 --> 00:06:28,400
so the accepted papers over the turned

196
00:06:28,400 --> 00:06:30,400
in papers is lower than the

197
00:06:30,400 --> 00:06:32,319
major revisions over the turned in

198
00:06:32,319 --> 00:06:33,759
papers

199
00:06:33,759 --> 00:06:36,000
yeah and because we're receiving um

200
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:37,840
increasing numbers of papers

201
00:06:37,840 --> 00:06:40,000
well we have a large number of papers

202
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:40,880
that haven't

203
00:06:40,880 --> 00:06:42,240
have gotten major revisions but haven't

204
00:06:42,240 --> 00:06:43,680
yet been accepted if we were in the

205
00:06:43,680 --> 00:06:44,880
steady state i think you could just

206
00:06:44,880 --> 00:06:46,400
count the accepted and shepherded

207
00:06:46,400 --> 00:06:47,520
fraction and that should reflect your

208
00:06:47,520 --> 00:06:49,360
overall acceptance but as the papers

209
00:06:49,360 --> 00:06:51,120
increase we have this increasing pool of

210
00:06:51,120 --> 00:06:52,560
papers that just recently got made

211
00:06:52,560 --> 00:06:53,360
revisions so

212
00:06:53,360 --> 00:06:55,280
yeah it makes the acceptance rate looks

213
00:06:55,280 --> 00:06:56,479
look lower than

214
00:06:56,479 --> 00:06:59,919
it actually will be in the long term

215
00:06:59,919 --> 00:07:02,479
okay so what appears at pets um we can

216
00:07:02,479 --> 00:07:03,919
see that indeed the case

217
00:07:03,919 --> 00:07:06,080
is that uh most papers go through major

218
00:07:06,080 --> 00:07:07,120
revisions

219
00:07:07,120 --> 00:07:08,479
um because about two-thirds of the

220
00:07:08,479 --> 00:07:10,960
papers that appear that's maybe 60

221
00:07:10,960 --> 00:07:14,800
uh first got a major revision um

222
00:07:14,800 --> 00:07:17,039
or were submitted to the issue which

223
00:07:17,039 --> 00:07:18,160
they were accepted they were submitted

224
00:07:18,160 --> 00:07:20,479
as a major revision

225
00:07:20,479 --> 00:07:22,400
um and i mean a large number of them

226
00:07:22,400 --> 00:07:23,919
were submitted as new papers and small

227
00:07:23,919 --> 00:07:24,560
production

228
00:07:24,560 --> 00:07:27,199
um were rejected were uh submitted to

229
00:07:27,199 --> 00:07:28,400
the paper that wasn't it had been

230
00:07:28,400 --> 00:07:29,599
rejected and resubmitted the previous

231
00:07:29,599 --> 00:07:31,759
one

232
00:07:31,759 --> 00:07:35,759
and looking at the issues the uh blue

233
00:07:35,759 --> 00:07:38,400
portions of each bar is are the papers

234
00:07:38,400 --> 00:07:39,840
that were not accepted and the green

235
00:07:39,840 --> 00:07:42,840
portions of those that were accepted

236
00:07:42,840 --> 00:07:45,840
um we were getting increasing numbers of

237
00:07:45,840 --> 00:07:47,360
submissions with every issue so you can

238
00:07:47,360 --> 00:07:48,400
kind of see that trend

239
00:07:48,400 --> 00:07:50,000
in both the accepted and this the

240
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:51,840
overall number of papers

241
00:07:51,840 --> 00:07:53,840
um it is different than in the past

242
00:07:53,840 --> 00:07:56,879
where we noticed a peek at issue two

243
00:07:56,879 --> 00:08:00,000
because issue two gives you two issues

244
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:03,440
to do major revisions um and still

245
00:08:03,440 --> 00:08:06,080
uh appear at that year's pets um so

246
00:08:06,080 --> 00:08:07,360
that's not happening this year but

247
00:08:07,360 --> 00:08:07,759
that's

248
00:08:07,759 --> 00:08:09,599
it's probably because authors that are

249
00:08:09,599 --> 00:08:11,039
doing that sort of thing are just being

250
00:08:11,039 --> 00:08:12,080
swamped by the

251
00:08:12,080 --> 00:08:13,520
increased overall increasing number of

252
00:08:13,520 --> 00:08:16,240
submission that's my takeaway

253
00:08:16,240 --> 00:08:18,720
next slide

254
00:08:20,240 --> 00:08:23,120
okay here are listed um the topics that

255
00:08:23,120 --> 00:08:24,080
authors

256
00:08:24,080 --> 00:08:26,080
self-select for their papers upon

257
00:08:26,080 --> 00:08:27,520
submission

258
00:08:27,520 --> 00:08:30,240
uh there are two clear outliers here uh

259
00:08:30,240 --> 00:08:31,440
cryptographic tools

260
00:08:31,440 --> 00:08:33,679
for privacy the papers that contribute

261
00:08:33,679 --> 00:08:34,719
uh

262
00:08:34,719 --> 00:08:36,799
primarily to photography or make use

263
00:08:36,799 --> 00:08:38,320
primarily of cryptography

264
00:08:38,320 --> 00:08:40,159
and machine learning those are far and

265
00:08:40,159 --> 00:08:42,240
away the most popular topics

266
00:08:42,240 --> 00:08:43,919
among the papers that were submitted to

267
00:08:43,919 --> 00:08:45,760
pets we can also

268
00:08:45,760 --> 00:08:48,800
see information leakage uh differential

269
00:08:48,800 --> 00:08:50,640
privacy and web privacy

270
00:08:50,640 --> 00:08:54,560
being pretty popular topics

271
00:08:54,560 --> 00:08:57,279
uh i think the next slide is artifacts

272
00:08:57,279 --> 00:08:57,760
if you

273
00:08:57,760 --> 00:09:01,040
go to that oh no this

274
00:09:01,040 --> 00:09:03,519
is this is my last one okay so uh

275
00:09:03,519 --> 00:09:05,600
something that happened in 2021 is that

276
00:09:05,600 --> 00:09:05,920
we

277
00:09:05,920 --> 00:09:08,240
um applied for and received an upgrade

278
00:09:08,240 --> 00:09:09,600
to our core ranking

279
00:09:09,600 --> 00:09:12,320
pets is now an a-ranked core conference

280
00:09:12,320 --> 00:09:13,519
if you're not familiar with it

281
00:09:13,519 --> 00:09:15,040
core is the computing research and

282
00:09:15,040 --> 00:09:18,000
education association of australasia

283
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:19,360
which you might wonder why it's

284
00:09:19,360 --> 00:09:21,120
important if you're not in australia or

285
00:09:21,120 --> 00:09:23,040
new zealand um but it is the case that

286
00:09:23,040 --> 00:09:24,399
this is a widely used ranking

287
00:09:24,399 --> 00:09:28,160
um used elsewhere to uh

288
00:09:28,160 --> 00:09:31,040
make to understand how effective or

289
00:09:31,040 --> 00:09:33,600
influential of conferences

290
00:09:33,600 --> 00:09:36,640
so this reflects i think that uh

291
00:09:36,640 --> 00:09:37,839
that's a good conference it has been for

292
00:09:37,839 --> 00:09:38,959
a while it just takes the ranking

293
00:09:38,959 --> 00:09:40,480
services a while to catch up to it and

294
00:09:40,480 --> 00:09:41,680
we finally had the chance

295
00:09:41,680 --> 00:09:43,120
they opened them up for they don't do

296
00:09:43,120 --> 00:09:44,800
this every year so this was our first

297
00:09:44,800 --> 00:09:46,240
chance in recent history to

298
00:09:46,240 --> 00:09:48,560
to upgrade our ranking you can see some

299
00:09:48,560 --> 00:09:49,279
the

300
00:09:49,279 --> 00:09:51,120
uh a ranked conferences in security and

301
00:09:51,120 --> 00:09:52,320
privacy uh

302
00:09:52,320 --> 00:09:55,040
tcc ufc asia crypt there is a ranking

303
00:09:55,040 --> 00:09:55,519
above

304
00:09:55,519 --> 00:09:58,399
a a that is a star you know cts ndss are

305
00:09:58,399 --> 00:09:59,120
in that

306
00:09:59,120 --> 00:10:02,000
you know we i maybe we should get there

307
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:04,240
you know at some point i think but uh

308
00:10:04,240 --> 00:10:06,880
i'm very happy that we're at least among

309
00:10:06,880 --> 00:10:08,240
the the top conferences

310
00:10:08,240 --> 00:10:10,240
in our area and the only privacy focus

311
00:10:10,240 --> 00:10:11,440
conference among these

312
00:10:11,440 --> 00:10:14,720
these conferences uh with these rankings

313
00:10:14,720 --> 00:10:16,959
um okay i think the next slide i think

314
00:10:16,959 --> 00:10:20,160
the artifacts is next

315
00:10:21,920 --> 00:10:23,760
okay before that i just want to

316
00:10:23,760 --> 00:10:25,680

00:10:30,880 --> 00:10:33,200
could submit to

321
00:10:33,200 --> 00:10:35,120
to submit your talk to talk the the

322
00:10:35,120 --> 00:10:36,480

oh um i'll just jump in and introduce

326
00:10:46,560 --> 00:10:48,000
bailey who is

327
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:50,800
joining me as a new artifact review

328
00:10:50,800 --> 00:10:52,000
chair

329
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:54,399
um so i'm very happy about that i'll

330
00:10:54,399 --> 00:10:55,279
just go through

331
00:10:55,279 --> 00:10:56,720
the first slide and then i'll let bailey

332
00:10:56,720 --> 00:10:59,120
talk about a new artifact award that

333
00:10:59,120 --> 00:11:00,480
we're going to introduce

334
00:11:00,480 --> 00:11:02,800
for the next year um this is just an

335
00:11:02,800 --> 00:11:05,120
overview of 2021

336
00:11:05,120 --> 00:11:07,839
so our artifact committee had 13

337
00:11:07,839 --> 00:11:08,959
different reviewers

338
00:11:08,959 --> 00:11:12,839
and this ended up being a very good size

339
00:11:12,839 --> 00:11:15,839
uh given the number of submissions that

340
00:11:15,839 --> 00:11:17,279
we had

341
00:11:17,279 --> 00:11:20,560
um there are different uh

342
00:11:20,560 --> 00:11:24,160
we had the authors of accepted papers

343
00:11:24,160 --> 00:11:25,600
submit their artifacts at the camera

344
00:11:25,600 --> 00:11:27,680
ready deadline and

345
00:11:27,680 --> 00:11:30,399
they selected what type of artifact they

346
00:11:30,399 --> 00:11:30,959
submitted

347
00:11:30,959 --> 00:11:32,959
it was a self-selected category and most

348
00:11:32,959 --> 00:11:35,120
of the artifacts we received were

349
00:11:35,120 --> 00:11:36,800
for source code but we also received

350
00:11:36,800 --> 00:11:38,880
data sets

351
00:11:38,880 --> 00:11:41,440
each artifact was assigned to reviewers

352
00:11:41,440 --> 00:11:43,360
and each reviewer had at most two

353
00:11:43,360 --> 00:11:44,800
artifacts per round

354
00:11:44,800 --> 00:11:46,079
so i think the load was pretty

355
00:11:46,079 --> 00:11:48,079
reasonable uh

356
00:11:48,079 --> 00:11:49,839
just more details about the review it's

357
00:11:49,839 --> 00:11:52,399
single blind so anonymous reviewers

358
00:11:52,399 --> 00:11:54,320
these papers have been accepted so it's

359
00:11:54,320 --> 00:11:55,839
kind of difficult to do anonymous

360
00:11:55,839 --> 00:11:58,880
author submissions

361
00:11:58,880 --> 00:12:00,880
most artifacts require one back and

362
00:12:00,880 --> 00:12:02,480
forth round with reviewers so the

363
00:12:02,480 --> 00:12:04,560
authors submit their artifacts

364
00:12:04,560 --> 00:12:06,320
almost all artifacts require a little

365
00:12:06,320 --> 00:12:08,639
bit of work

366
00:12:08,639 --> 00:12:10,000
and then the authors fix that and

367
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:11,519
resubmit it and at that point it's

368
00:12:11,519 --> 00:12:13,200
usually ready to go

369
00:12:13,200 --> 00:12:16,160
um we do have some exceptions and in

370
00:12:16,160 --> 00:12:18,000
general i would say

371
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:20,720
as was the case last year uh one of the

372
00:12:20,720 --> 00:12:22,240
challenges with artifact review

373
00:12:22,240 --> 00:12:24,320
is that the turnaround time can be quite

374
00:12:24,320 --> 00:12:25,600
slow um

375
00:12:25,600 --> 00:12:27,440
since this is far after the paper has

376
00:12:27,440 --> 00:12:29,360
been accepted and people are working on

377
00:12:29,360 --> 00:12:31,120
new projects or moved on

378
00:12:31,120 --> 00:12:33,760
um from being grad students so we tend

379
00:12:33,760 --> 00:12:35,519
to keep very lenient deadlines but we do

380
00:12:35,519 --> 00:12:37,839
end up with some like

381
00:12:37,839 --> 00:12:40,720
uh artifacts that we keep constantly

382
00:12:40,720 --> 00:12:43,360
trying to push through the pipeline

383
00:12:43,360 --> 00:12:45,920
next slide

384
00:12:48,480 --> 00:12:51,600
okay so here's just some statistics

385
00:12:51,600 --> 00:12:53,760
similar to how we presented last year we

386
00:12:53,760 --> 00:12:57,200
had 34 artifacts submitted this year

387
00:12:57,200 --> 00:12:59,920
13 have been fully accepted 20 are still

388
00:12:59,920 --> 00:13:01,279
being reviewed

389
00:13:01,279 --> 00:13:04,880
many of those are for issue 4 which we

390
00:13:04,880 --> 00:13:06,720
have not finished the review process for

391
00:13:06,720 --> 00:13:07,680
yet

392
00:13:07,680 --> 00:13:10,160
and we had one artifact rejected the

393
00:13:10,160 --> 00:13:10,720
only

394
00:13:10,720 --> 00:13:12,480
absolute rejection we've had so far was

395
00:13:12,480 --> 00:13:14,000
due to the fact that somebody tried to

396
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:14,480
submit

397
00:13:14,480 --> 00:13:17,519
a binary blob instead of open source

398
00:13:17,519 --> 00:13:18,240
code

399
00:13:18,240 --> 00:13:19,760
and we made a decision not to accept

400
00:13:19,760 --> 00:13:21,279
this as an artifact

401
00:13:21,279 --> 00:13:22,880
uh but i suppose that could be an

402
00:13:22,880 --> 00:13:25,760
ongoing discussion in the future

403
00:13:25,760 --> 00:13:28,160
um most submissions had more than one

404
00:13:28,160 --> 00:13:29,920
type so they were both source code and

405
00:13:29,920 --> 00:13:31,680
some kind of scripts or data sets

406
00:13:31,680 --> 00:13:34,399
29 submissions included some type of

407
00:13:34,399 --> 00:13:35,040
code

408
00:13:35,040 --> 00:13:38,160
and 15 submissions included data sets

409
00:13:38,160 --> 00:13:39,440
you can see a breakdown here of

410
00:13:39,440 --> 00:13:41,519
submissions for issue

411
00:13:41,519 --> 00:13:44,639
we have the most submissions for issue 4

412
00:13:44,639 --> 00:13:46,480
but we had a pretty even amount there

413
00:13:46,480 --> 00:13:48,480
were very few submissions for issue one

414
00:13:48,480 --> 00:13:51,279
however and we're up from 25 total

415
00:13:51,279 --> 00:13:53,360
solutions last year

416
00:13:53,360 --> 00:13:55,120
and now i'll hand it off to bailey who's

417
00:13:55,120 --> 00:13:57,519
going to talk about artifact reports

418
00:13:57,519 --> 00:14:00,560
thanks all right so we could just stop

419
00:14:00,560 --> 00:14:02,320
the next slide

420
00:14:02,320 --> 00:14:05,360
um as cecilia said we're going to be

421
00:14:05,360 --> 00:14:06,480
introducing a new

422
00:14:06,480 --> 00:14:09,680
artifact award for the 2022 cycle

423
00:14:09,680 --> 00:14:11,120
uh in large parts this has been

424
00:14:11,120 --> 00:14:13,120
motivated by receiving some truly

425
00:14:13,120 --> 00:14:14,240
exceptional

426
00:14:14,240 --> 00:14:17,600
artifacts and we want to kind of reward

427
00:14:17,600 --> 00:14:20,399
this effort that authors are making so

428
00:14:20,399 --> 00:14:20,720
the

429
00:14:20,720 --> 00:14:22,480
award we're proposing will acknowledge

430
00:14:22,480 --> 00:14:24,560
uh the particular artifacts excellence

431
00:14:24,560 --> 00:14:26,399
on the pet's website similar to other

432
00:14:26,399 --> 00:14:28,240
awards that already exist

433
00:14:28,240 --> 00:14:29,839
any of the artifacts that have been

434
00:14:29,839 --> 00:14:33,440
submitted within this next 2022

435
00:14:33,440 --> 00:14:35,920
homepets publication year for any of the

436
00:14:35,920 --> 00:14:38,000
submission cycles will be eligible

437
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:40,000
a word worthiness is going to be

438
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:42,160
determined based on the author's initial

439
00:14:42,160 --> 00:14:42,880
submission

440
00:14:42,880 --> 00:14:45,199
and this is to encourage the strong

441
00:14:45,199 --> 00:14:46,880
initial submission and reward the

442
00:14:46,880 --> 00:14:47,760
authors for these

443
00:14:47,760 --> 00:14:50,320
upfront efforts before going through the

444
00:14:50,320 --> 00:14:51,920
iterative process

445
00:14:51,920 --> 00:14:54,959
with the reviewers our artifact

446
00:14:54,959 --> 00:14:56,639
committee members can nominate

447
00:14:56,639 --> 00:14:59,519
any artifact when they submit the review

448
00:14:59,519 --> 00:15:00,399
for it

449
00:15:00,399 --> 00:15:03,120
and we're going to after all of the

450
00:15:03,120 --> 00:15:04,560
artifacts have been reviewed

451
00:15:04,560 --> 00:15:06,800
and these sort of nominations have come

452
00:15:06,800 --> 00:15:09,040
through have a committee of two to three

453
00:15:09,040 --> 00:15:10,880
members of the artifact made which

454
00:15:10,880 --> 00:15:13,360
will include the chairs sicilian myself

455
00:15:13,360 --> 00:15:15,440
to evaluate these nominated artifacts

456
00:15:15,440 --> 00:15:17,519
focusing on their reproducibility their

457
00:15:17,519 --> 00:15:19,360
usability and their accessibility

458
00:15:19,360 --> 00:15:21,680
to the audience they are being directed

459
00:15:21,680 --> 00:15:23,760
at

460
00:15:23,760 --> 00:15:26,240
so if you have any input or questions

461
00:15:26,240 --> 00:15:27,279
we'd be happy to hear

462
00:15:27,279 --> 00:15:28,720
about them throughout the week and that

463
00:15:28,720 --> 00:15:30,480
i will turn it over to whoever is

464
00:15:30,480 --> 00:15:33,360
speaking next

465
00:15:34,079 --> 00:15:41,839
i don't know

466
00:15:46,160 --> 00:15:48,720
okay i i i was hoping that we would

467
00:15:48,720 --> 00:15:50,320
actually skip this slide so let's go to

468
00:15:50,320 --> 00:15:52,839
the next one right away

469
00:15:52,839 --> 00:15:56,480
uh uh so i i wanted to talk about a

470
00:15:56,480 --> 00:15:58,160
couple of things

471
00:15:58,160 --> 00:16:01,279
uh that we change or

472
00:16:01,279 --> 00:16:03,680
change starting actually this issue

473
00:16:03,680 --> 00:16:05,040
michelle and i

474
00:16:05,040 --> 00:16:08,720
um and it is a little bit in response

475
00:16:08,720 --> 00:16:12,720
to uh what happened in terms

476
00:16:12,720 --> 00:16:15,759
of the um

477
00:16:15,759 --> 00:16:20,800
very much increasing number of uh

478
00:16:20,959 --> 00:16:23,440
papers that we got which induces a very

479
00:16:23,440 --> 00:16:24,399
much induced

480
00:16:24,399 --> 00:16:27,680
redu increased number of um

481
00:16:27,680 --> 00:16:30,800
reviews which in turn inc induces a very

482
00:16:30,800 --> 00:16:31,680
much

483
00:16:31,680 --> 00:16:34,480
uh increased load on the pc chairs of

484
00:16:34,480 --> 00:16:36,399
reading those reviews

485
00:16:36,399 --> 00:16:39,759
and uh in my opinion this

486
00:16:39,759 --> 00:16:43,440
what pets what i always valued about

487
00:16:43,440 --> 00:16:45,360
pets is that pets had one of the best

488
00:16:45,360 --> 00:16:47,839
review processes in the community

489
00:16:47,839 --> 00:16:51,040
and uh what michelle and i try to do is

490
00:16:51,040 --> 00:16:52,959
try to keep that

491
00:16:52,959 --> 00:16:55,600
at this high level as possible and we've

492
00:16:55,600 --> 00:16:56,959
done a couple of things and

493
00:16:56,959 --> 00:16:59,279
uh one will come up later on but one

494
00:16:59,279 --> 00:17:00,560
thing that we did is

495
00:17:00,560 --> 00:17:02,399
we instantiated the senior program

496
00:17:02,399 --> 00:17:03,839
committee

497
00:17:03,839 --> 00:17:06,959
whose task it is actually to read

498
00:17:06,959 --> 00:17:11,199
and help improve uh the um

499
00:17:11,199 --> 00:17:14,559
the reviews and uh lead the discussion

500
00:17:14,559 --> 00:17:19,199
and coming to a consensus so that we

501
00:17:19,199 --> 00:17:19,599
have

502
00:17:19,599 --> 00:17:22,400
actually a high quality of reviews that

503
00:17:22,400 --> 00:17:24,720
every review is being read

504
00:17:24,720 --> 00:17:27,839
and provides fair and accurate feedback

505
00:17:27,839 --> 00:17:32,240
uh to the process in addition uh

506
00:17:32,240 --> 00:17:34,559
in last year's town hall meeting uh when

507
00:17:34,559 --> 00:17:36,080
i was present

508
00:17:36,080 --> 00:17:39,039
i heard a strong desire to have a

509
00:17:39,039 --> 00:17:39,760
feedback

510
00:17:39,760 --> 00:17:44,640
process on uh the

511
00:17:45,120 --> 00:17:47,280
on the reviews for uh that are being

512
00:17:47,280 --> 00:17:48,480
received

513
00:17:48,480 --> 00:17:53,039
and um this is a difficult thing to do

514
00:17:53,039 --> 00:17:55,919
uh however we have a test run process

515
00:17:55,919 --> 00:17:57,520
that we try to be a little bit more

516
00:17:57,520 --> 00:17:59,440
systematic this year

517
00:17:59,440 --> 00:18:01,760
and we will collect review from the

518
00:18:01,760 --> 00:18:03,039
authors

519
00:18:03,039 --> 00:18:05,919
uh from fellow reviewers and from the

520
00:18:05,919 --> 00:18:08,080
senior program committee

521
00:18:08,080 --> 00:18:10,640
and uh uh one of the questions whether

522
00:18:10,640 --> 00:18:12,080
one can ask already

523
00:18:12,080 --> 00:18:15,760
is uh is the perception of reviews

524
00:18:15,760 --> 00:18:18,559
consistent among those three groups

525
00:18:18,559 --> 00:18:20,480
and does it even make sense uh to

526
00:18:20,480 --> 00:18:22,000
collect review from all

527
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:24,559
all of these three groups uh going

528
00:18:24,559 --> 00:18:25,120
forward

529
00:18:25,120 --> 00:18:29,600
and uh we will be very careful not to uh

530
00:18:29,600 --> 00:18:33,600
instantiate some sort of uh

531
00:18:33,600 --> 00:18:37,360
reviewer rating uh and instead keep the

532
00:18:37,360 --> 00:18:38,000
numbers

533
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:42,080
very much at an aggregate level uh so

534
00:18:42,080 --> 00:18:44,240
these are two changes uh to the review

535
00:18:44,240 --> 00:18:45,120
process

536
00:18:45,120 --> 00:18:47,760
uh michelle is it okay if i talk about

537
00:18:47,760 --> 00:18:49,600
the last point before going to the

538
00:18:49,600 --> 00:18:50,640
ethics

539
00:18:50,640 --> 00:18:54,840
uh so so another thing is uh we did

540
00:18:54,840 --> 00:18:57,760
um uh

541
00:18:59,120 --> 00:19:01,520
increase the program committee because i

542
00:19:01,520 --> 00:19:03,039
think people who have been on the broken

543
00:19:03,039 --> 00:19:03,840
committee

544
00:19:03,840 --> 00:19:06,960
for issue four in 2021

545
00:19:06,960 --> 00:19:09,440
uh would agree that the review load was

546
00:19:09,440 --> 00:19:10,559
very high

547
00:19:10,559 --> 00:19:12,960
and many reviewers complained to aaron

548
00:19:12,960 --> 00:19:13,919
and me

549
00:19:13,919 --> 00:19:17,679
uh about uh that they could not yet

550
00:19:17,679 --> 00:19:20,400
take yet another review and although we

551
00:19:20,400 --> 00:19:22,080
probably would have needed them to do

552
00:19:22,080 --> 00:19:22,960
because

553
00:19:22,960 --> 00:19:26,320
of these or that circumstances

554
00:19:26,320 --> 00:19:29,600
um so so again in the interest

555
00:19:29,600 --> 00:19:32,720
of review quality we increased uh

556
00:19:32,720 --> 00:19:36,720
uh the the pc um however i'm

557
00:19:36,720 --> 00:19:40,240
if the increase in submissions goes on

558
00:19:40,240 --> 00:19:44,240
like in 2021 uh we need to be prepared

559
00:19:44,240 --> 00:19:46,240
for yet another program committee

560
00:19:46,240 --> 00:19:47,600
extension

561
00:19:47,600 --> 00:19:50,500
um and um

562
00:19:50,500 --> 00:19:51,760
[Music]

563
00:19:51,760 --> 00:19:55,039
we will probably be issue another uh

564
00:19:55,039 --> 00:19:58,320
request for nominations uh and see

565
00:19:58,320 --> 00:20:01,280
who can we get from the community on the

566
00:20:01,280 --> 00:20:02,400
program committee

567
00:20:02,400 --> 00:20:06,480
in order to um

568
00:20:06,480 --> 00:20:08,559
keep the review load reasonable which at

569
00:20:08,559 --> 00:20:09,919
the moment it is

570
00:20:09,919 --> 00:20:11,919
uh but we want to keep that also going

571
00:20:11,919 --> 00:20:13,039
forward because

572
00:20:13,039 --> 00:20:16,799
also a a lower reviewing load ensures

573
00:20:16,799 --> 00:20:20,960
higher uh review quality overall

574
00:20:20,960 --> 00:20:23,280
um

575
00:20:29,039 --> 00:20:32,000
okay with that i will pass on to

576
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:33,200
michelle for now

577
00:20:33,200 --> 00:20:36,720
is that okay yeah um okay

578
00:20:36,720 --> 00:20:39,280
so uh i don't know that we've spent a

579
00:20:39,280 --> 00:20:40,880
long time on this but yeah we're

580
00:20:40,880 --> 00:20:44,159
um we're just adding a little bit of

581
00:20:44,159 --> 00:20:46,240
extra depth to you know ethics review

582
00:20:46,240 --> 00:20:46,640
has

583
00:20:46,640 --> 00:20:48,559
always been a part of pets reviewing

584
00:20:48,559 --> 00:20:50,320
like this is not new but we're just

585
00:20:50,320 --> 00:20:52,640
adding a little bit of extra depth

586
00:20:52,640 --> 00:20:55,679
basically to make sure that if there's

587
00:20:55,679 --> 00:20:58,559
any paper with ethical concerns

588
00:20:58,559 --> 00:21:00,240
we want to make sure that those concerns

589
00:21:00,240 --> 00:21:03,200
get brought up and that they receive

590
00:21:03,200 --> 00:21:04,960
you know a sufficient amount of

591
00:21:04,960 --> 00:21:06,720
consideration

592
00:21:06,720 --> 00:21:08,080
and so basically what we're doing is

593
00:21:08,080 --> 00:21:10,000
we're introducing a way for

594
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:12,000
starting issue two for our viewers to

595
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:13,440
indicate whether they have

596
00:21:13,440 --> 00:21:16,080
any ethical concerns that they don't

597
00:21:16,080 --> 00:21:16,880
think have been

598
00:21:16,880 --> 00:21:19,679
sufficiently uh explained or mitigated

599
00:21:19,679 --> 00:21:21,039
by what the authors write

600
00:21:21,039 --> 00:21:22,960
so the question is not you know does

601
00:21:22,960 --> 00:21:24,640
this paper have ethical implications

602
00:21:24,640 --> 00:21:25,600
because i think

603
00:21:25,600 --> 00:21:27,120
you know basically every paper submitted

604
00:21:27,120 --> 00:21:29,039
to pets has ethical implications but the

605
00:21:29,039 --> 00:21:30,000
question is you know

606
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:31,440
is there some ethical issue with this

607
00:21:31,440 --> 00:21:34,880
paper that is not sufficiently resolved

608
00:21:34,880 --> 00:21:36,799
and so that will sort of call attention

609
00:21:36,799 --> 00:21:38,240
to the issue

610
00:21:38,240 --> 00:21:39,919
which we're going to ask the senior pc

611
00:21:39,919 --> 00:21:42,080
member and their viewers to

612
00:21:42,080 --> 00:21:45,520
you know consider and then as needed

613
00:21:45,520 --> 00:21:47,760
we have a set of volunteer sort of

614
00:21:47,760 --> 00:21:48,960
ethics task force

615
00:21:48,960 --> 00:21:51,120
folks from the program committee who

616
00:21:51,120 --> 00:21:52,720
have agreed to sort of take on

617
00:21:52,720 --> 00:21:55,200
short notice additional ethics focused

618
00:21:55,200 --> 00:21:56,559
reviews

619
00:21:56,559 --> 00:21:58,880
so they will uh when we think it's you

620
00:21:58,880 --> 00:22:00,799
know necessary we'll do an another read

621
00:22:00,799 --> 00:22:03,200
and provide another ethics perspective

622
00:22:03,200 --> 00:22:04,880
uh with the goal of just sort of folding

623
00:22:04,880 --> 00:22:06,480
this into the overall

624
00:22:06,480 --> 00:22:08,960
discussion this is not like send the

625
00:22:08,960 --> 00:22:11,200
paper over to some other corner to be

626
00:22:11,200 --> 00:22:13,120
debated in an ethics sense it's trying

627
00:22:13,120 --> 00:22:13,760
to bring

628
00:22:13,760 --> 00:22:15,840
the ethical implications into the

629
00:22:15,840 --> 00:22:17,520
overall review of the scientific

630
00:22:17,520 --> 00:22:18,960
contribution on the paper

631
00:22:18,960 --> 00:22:20,799
so that's kind of at a high level um

632
00:22:20,799 --> 00:22:22,720
what we're planning to do

633
00:22:22,720 --> 00:22:24,480
we'll put a little bit more information

634
00:22:24,480 --> 00:22:26,960
about that up with the cfp

635
00:22:26,960 --> 00:22:30,240
uh before too long um and yeah i think

636
00:22:30,240 --> 00:22:30,640
that's

637
00:22:30,640 --> 00:22:33,280
that's mostly you know how that's gonna

638
00:22:33,280 --> 00:22:35,520
work

639
00:22:38,640 --> 00:22:40,720
okay i think we can open up the floor to

640
00:22:40,720 --> 00:22:44,240
comments questions suggestions

641
00:22:50,320 --> 00:22:53,200
um yeah let's see so if you have a

642
00:22:53,200 --> 00:22:54,400
question or comment you can come to the

643
00:22:54,400 --> 00:22:55,520
mic i also seen

644
00:22:55,520 --> 00:22:59,280
a some show up in the chat um the

645
00:22:59,280 --> 00:23:00,880
one that i saw that i think hasn't been

646
00:23:00,880 --> 00:23:02,559
addressed is a boat

647
00:23:02,559 --> 00:23:05,679
open review right i just tried to post a

648
00:23:05,679 --> 00:23:07,200
little bit of a response but we can

649
00:23:07,200 --> 00:23:08,000
definitely discuss

650
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:10,559
it in more detail i also think we have a

651
00:23:10,559 --> 00:23:12,480
couple of questions on the next slide if

652
00:23:12,480 --> 00:23:14,559
you go to the next slide

653
00:23:14,559 --> 00:23:17,760
or did we remove those yeah okay

654
00:23:17,760 --> 00:23:19,919
so so in general what i see as the big

655
00:23:19,919 --> 00:23:21,120
challenge for

656
00:23:21,120 --> 00:23:24,159
pets if if this continues to grow

657
00:23:24,159 --> 00:23:26,880
is how do we handle the increase in the

658
00:23:26,880 --> 00:23:29,039
number of submissions

659
00:23:29,039 --> 00:23:30,960
right if if pets is going to grow at

660
00:23:30,960 --> 00:23:32,559
this rate this

661
00:23:32,559 --> 00:23:36,960
this really intensive review process

662
00:23:36,960 --> 00:23:40,400
is under a lot of challenges

663
00:23:40,400 --> 00:23:44,080
and um i believe uh that

664
00:23:44,080 --> 00:23:47,919
maintaining that will be

665
00:23:47,919 --> 00:23:51,679
will be very very difficult also we are

666
00:23:51,679 --> 00:23:54,080
as we have now moved into an a-rank

667
00:23:54,080 --> 00:23:55,760
conference thanks to aaron and

668
00:23:55,760 --> 00:23:58,799
a number of other people which aaron can

669
00:23:58,799 --> 00:24:01,039
list

670
00:24:02,960 --> 00:24:06,880
we receive a broader set of topics

671
00:24:06,880 --> 00:24:10,320
and it is very difficult for us uh to uh

672
00:24:10,320 --> 00:24:13,840
as pro pc chairs to decide uh

673
00:24:13,840 --> 00:24:16,720
uh to keep this to decide on the scope

674
00:24:16,720 --> 00:24:18,720
of pets

675
00:24:18,720 --> 00:24:20,799
that's also an effect of the number of

676
00:24:20,799 --> 00:24:22,159
submissions

677
00:24:22,159 --> 00:24:24,960
uh so these are basically things that i

678
00:24:24,960 --> 00:24:26,720
think we should think about

679
00:24:26,720 --> 00:24:28,960
in terms of if we are continuing to grow

680
00:24:28,960 --> 00:24:32,080
at the rate that we have been growing

681
00:24:32,080 --> 00:24:34,720
there will be a lot of strain on the

682
00:24:34,720 --> 00:24:36,640
current system

683
00:24:36,640 --> 00:24:38,960
and uh yes the other one the fourth

684
00:24:38,960 --> 00:24:40,240
question put up here is

685
00:24:40,240 --> 00:24:42,320
uh we're basically in the situation

686
00:24:42,320 --> 00:24:43,440
right now

687
00:24:43,440 --> 00:24:47,200
is uh how do we um

688
00:24:47,200 --> 00:24:50,960
uh have future conferences right

689
00:24:50,960 --> 00:24:54,480
is a hybrid mode uh is

690
00:24:54,480 --> 00:24:56,240
is that something we need is that

691
00:24:56,240 --> 00:24:57,840
something we want

692
00:24:57,840 --> 00:25:01,200
uh maybe some thoughts around

693
00:25:01,200 --> 00:25:03,840
uh how you want to meet as a group is

694
00:25:03,840 --> 00:25:04,320
this

695
00:25:04,320 --> 00:25:06,400
is this something like like this is this

696
00:25:06,400 --> 00:25:07,440
something you like

697
00:25:07,440 --> 00:25:09,279
is this like an option you like to have

698
00:25:09,279 --> 00:25:10,640
but you would also like to have the

699
00:25:10,640 --> 00:25:11,279
in-kind

700
00:25:11,279 --> 00:25:14,640
in person option or uh would you only

701
00:25:14,640 --> 00:25:15,440
want to have

702
00:25:15,440 --> 00:25:18,159
an in-person option right so this is

703
00:25:18,159 --> 00:25:20,000
also something uh

704
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:23,039
where uh we struggle a little bit with

705
00:25:23,039 --> 00:25:29,840
uh what the community thinks

706
00:25:31,360 --> 00:25:33,520
all right those are some seed questions

707
00:25:33,520 --> 00:25:36,000
right if you if you type in the chat

708
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:38,080
please type to everyone otherwise we do

709
00:25:38,080 --> 00:25:40,480
not see it the default is nearby

710
00:25:40,480 --> 00:25:43,039
and i made the same mistake and nearby

711
00:25:43,039 --> 00:25:44,960
is only the ones that are i don't know

712
00:25:44,960 --> 00:25:47,360
in what kind of circle around you

713
00:25:47,360 --> 00:25:49,279
so aaron apparently didn't even see my

714
00:25:49,279 --> 00:25:50,799
nearby comment

715
00:25:50,799 --> 00:25:54,559
on the uh open review until i actually

716
00:25:54,559 --> 00:25:57,840
posted it to everyone
