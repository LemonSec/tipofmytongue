00:00:00,480 --> 00:00:02,399
hello everyone um i'm minior

2
00:00:02,399 --> 00:00:04,000
grataformendi and today i'll be

3
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:05,359
presenting zika sense

4
00:00:05,359 --> 00:00:07,520
a frictionless privacy preserving human

5
00:00:07,520 --> 00:00:10,559
attestation mechanism for mobile devices

6
00:00:10,559 --> 00:00:12,480
this is joint work with panos mateo

7
00:00:12,480 --> 00:00:14,000
antonio stan

8
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:16,800
and ben and it was performed while i was

9
00:00:16,800 --> 00:00:20,000
part of braves research team

10
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:23,039
so in 2019

11
00:00:23,039 --> 00:00:24,880
the estimate of traffic that was

12
00:00:24,880 --> 00:00:27,039
associated with a user

13
00:00:27,039 --> 00:00:29,599
but it was not triggered by a human was

14
00:00:29,599 --> 00:00:31,199
around 20

15
00:00:31,199 --> 00:00:33,840
and it is expected that billions of

16
00:00:33,840 --> 00:00:35,600
dollars have been spent by tech

17
00:00:35,600 --> 00:00:39,040
companies um due to these um

18
00:00:39,040 --> 00:00:41,520
events and is expected to grow even more

19
00:00:41,520 --> 00:00:44,559
up to 50 million dollars by 2025.

20
00:00:44,559 --> 00:00:47,840
another observation of this type of

21
00:00:47,840 --> 00:00:51,280
studies is that more more and more of

22
00:00:51,280 --> 00:00:52,239
these events

23
00:00:52,239 --> 00:00:55,920
happen on mobile devices or smartphones

24
00:00:55,920 --> 00:00:57,760
so the current solution solution is

25
00:00:57,760 --> 00:00:59,440
captures and all the different flavors

26
00:00:59,440 --> 00:01:01,039
of captchas

27
00:01:01,039 --> 00:01:04,159
and we've all been um we've all been

28
00:01:04,159 --> 00:01:06,080
annoyed at some point by having to find

29
00:01:06,080 --> 00:01:09,040
traffic lights or buses and at some

30
00:01:09,040 --> 00:01:10,240
points even not knowing

31
00:01:10,240 --> 00:01:12,159
what we got wrong and when we got it

32
00:01:12,159 --> 00:01:14,080
wrong so it is not really

33
00:01:14,080 --> 00:01:17,280
user friendly also some of some studies

34
00:01:17,280 --> 00:01:18,240
have proved

35
00:01:18,240 --> 00:01:20,880
that um image space capture or audio

36
00:01:20,880 --> 00:01:22,960
capture or even semantic captures

37
00:01:22,960 --> 00:01:26,080
are not bulletproof and there's been

38
00:01:26,080 --> 00:01:28,640
several type of attacks to undermine

39
00:01:28,640 --> 00:01:30,159
these mechanisms

40
00:01:30,159 --> 00:01:32,240
and finally one of the latest recaptchas

41
00:01:32,240 --> 00:01:33,680
presented by google

42
00:01:33,680 --> 00:01:39,520
mainly capture v3 consists in using

43
00:01:39,520 --> 00:01:42,240
user data generated while browsing and

44
00:01:42,240 --> 00:01:43,680
sending it over to the server so that

45
00:01:43,680 --> 00:01:44,399
the server can

46
00:01:44,399 --> 00:01:47,119
compute a score of the level of

47
00:01:47,119 --> 00:01:48,240
humanness

48
00:01:48,240 --> 00:01:50,880
that generated this this data of course

49
00:01:50,880 --> 00:01:53,280
this has raised privacy concerns as

50
00:01:53,280 --> 00:01:55,119
this type of data can be used to

51
00:01:55,119 --> 00:01:57,119
fingerprint and identify

52
00:01:57,119 --> 00:02:00,000
users so our goal in this work is to

53
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:01,680
kind of find a hybrid solution in

54
00:02:01,680 --> 00:02:03,119
between the two

55
00:02:03,119 --> 00:02:05,759
in between the privacy preserving image

56
00:02:05,759 --> 00:02:06,799
based captcha

57
00:02:06,799 --> 00:02:09,840
and the seamless captcha v3 solution and

58
00:02:09,840 --> 00:02:12,720
achieving both of the good properties

59
00:02:12,720 --> 00:02:15,520
simultaneously so the k idea of our work

60
00:02:15,520 --> 00:02:16,720
is similar to what

61
00:02:16,720 --> 00:02:20,080
what is presented by captcha v3 which is

62
00:02:20,080 --> 00:02:21,040
basically use

63
00:02:21,040 --> 00:02:23,840
some sort of action of the user normal

64
00:02:23,840 --> 00:02:24,640
action

65
00:02:24,640 --> 00:02:26,640
of the user while using the device or

66
00:02:26,640 --> 00:02:28,319
all while browsing

67
00:02:28,319 --> 00:02:31,920
and using um data generated

68
00:02:31,920 --> 00:02:35,120
well during these actions to detect uh

69
00:02:35,120 --> 00:02:38,160
it's to determine its humanness

70
00:02:38,160 --> 00:02:40,400
in our case what we use is the the

71
00:02:40,400 --> 00:02:41,840
movement

72
00:02:41,840 --> 00:02:45,280
triggered by a touch event and

73
00:02:45,280 --> 00:02:47,200
getting the data captured by the sensors

74
00:02:47,200 --> 00:02:48,640
at that point

75
00:02:48,640 --> 00:02:50,800
figuring out whether it is a human or

76
00:02:50,800 --> 00:02:51,680
not

77
00:02:51,680 --> 00:02:54,720
and as it turns out sensors do

78
00:02:54,720 --> 00:02:56,720
distinguish humans so note that on the

79
00:02:56,720 --> 00:02:58,319
right hand side the y-axis

80
00:02:58,319 --> 00:03:01,599
is not in the same

81
00:03:01,599 --> 00:03:03,040
it's not the same as in the left-hand

82
00:03:03,040 --> 00:03:05,120
side so even if if there seems to be a

83
00:03:05,120 --> 00:03:06,319
lot of movement on the right hand side

84
00:03:06,319 --> 00:03:07,920
there's not so much compared to

85
00:03:07,920 --> 00:03:11,200
to to what happens on the left side

86
00:03:11,200 --> 00:03:13,519
so the sensors react as we expect when

87
00:03:13,519 --> 00:03:14,560
we touch

88
00:03:14,560 --> 00:03:15,920
the mobile phone which is all of a

89
00:03:15,920 --> 00:03:18,159
sudden they receive they receive

90
00:03:18,159 --> 00:03:21,440
a sudden movement that we can detect

91
00:03:21,440 --> 00:03:23,360
by using this we can then determine

92
00:03:23,360 --> 00:03:24,480
whether um

93
00:03:24,480 --> 00:03:27,360
a touch event was triggered by a human

94
00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:27,680
or

95
00:03:27,680 --> 00:03:29,680
a bot and for that we train a machine

96
00:03:29,680 --> 00:03:31,440
learning model so

97
00:03:31,440 --> 00:03:34,480
an event happens a touch happens it

98
00:03:34,480 --> 00:03:36,799
triggers certain feedback from the

99
00:03:36,799 --> 00:03:37,599
sensors

100
00:03:37,599 --> 00:03:39,840
and then we use this data in order to

101
00:03:39,840 --> 00:03:42,400
determine whether the user

102
00:03:42,400 --> 00:03:46,400
is a human or a bot um

103
00:03:46,400 --> 00:03:48,640
this sort of authentication is not novel

104
00:03:48,640 --> 00:03:50,319
and has already

105
00:03:50,319 --> 00:03:53,599
been presented in past work

106
00:03:53,599 --> 00:03:56,400
and the main two directions that these

107
00:03:56,400 --> 00:03:58,840
machine learning human attestation

108
00:03:58,840 --> 00:04:03,120
solutions happen is on the one side

109
00:04:03,120 --> 00:04:05,200
the at the station or the evaluation of

110
00:04:05,200 --> 00:04:06,720
the model happens in the server so

111
00:04:06,720 --> 00:04:07,519
basically

112
00:04:07,519 --> 00:04:10,879
the the user needs to send all this data

113
00:04:10,879 --> 00:04:12,080
to the server and then the server will

114
00:04:12,080 --> 00:04:13,760
determine whether that data comes from a

115
00:04:13,760 --> 00:04:14,879
human or not

116
00:04:14,879 --> 00:04:17,279
this has the same privacy concerns as

117
00:04:17,279 --> 00:04:18,560
captcha v3 which

118
00:04:18,560 --> 00:04:20,798
mainly consists in what can the server

119
00:04:20,798 --> 00:04:23,280
do with this data

120
00:04:23,280 --> 00:04:25,199
the other line is basically to evaluate

121
00:04:25,199 --> 00:04:28,240
it locally and simply send the result

122
00:04:28,240 --> 00:04:31,600
however in a in a scenario such as brave

123
00:04:31,600 --> 00:04:32,240
where

124
00:04:32,240 --> 00:04:34,320
uh the code is open source we can

125
00:04:34,320 --> 00:04:35,680
clearly not rely on

126
00:04:35,680 --> 00:04:39,280
on on something that is simply sent uh

127
00:04:39,280 --> 00:04:41,600
by the user as a user could change the

128
00:04:41,600 --> 00:04:43,919
code and simply send i'm human i'm human

129
00:04:43,919 --> 00:04:46,560
constantly

130
00:04:47,280 --> 00:04:49,280
also so one one common problem of this

131
00:04:49,280 --> 00:04:50,560
type of solutions

132
00:04:50,560 --> 00:04:53,360
is that the origin of the data cannot be

133
00:04:53,360 --> 00:04:55,360
guaranteed

134
00:04:55,360 --> 00:04:57,759
there needs to be some trust assumptions

135
00:04:57,759 --> 00:04:58,400
there

136
00:04:58,400 --> 00:05:00,800
some some mechanisms uh presented in the

137
00:05:00,800 --> 00:05:01,520
literature

138
00:05:01,520 --> 00:05:04,000
assume that there is existence of a

139
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:05,440
trusted platform module

140
00:05:05,440 --> 00:05:08,160
others simply assume that the data is uh

141
00:05:08,160 --> 00:05:08,880
comes

142
00:05:08,880 --> 00:05:10,479
from from the sensors and the same

143
00:05:10,479 --> 00:05:12,000
happens with capture v3

144
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:14,000
at the end when you use data of how the

145
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:15,520
mouse moves or how the keyboard is

146
00:05:15,520 --> 00:05:17,039
touched

147
00:05:17,039 --> 00:05:19,360
the guarantees of the of the origin of

148
00:05:19,360 --> 00:05:21,120
that data can only be given as much as

149
00:05:21,120 --> 00:05:23,360
the application itself can give

150
00:05:23,360 --> 00:05:26,000
our work is not an exception to this and

151
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:26,560
zika

152
00:05:26,560 --> 00:05:29,199
sense does not give any further

153
00:05:29,199 --> 00:05:30,720
guarantees of the origin

154
00:05:30,720 --> 00:05:34,320
of the sensors okay so

155
00:05:34,320 --> 00:05:37,360
our goal in this work is basically to

156
00:05:37,360 --> 00:05:39,440
follow this one line of thought of human

157
00:05:39,440 --> 00:05:40,720
attestation through ml

158
00:05:40,720 --> 00:05:42,800
which consists in evaluating the model

159
00:05:42,800 --> 00:05:43,759
locally

160
00:05:43,759 --> 00:05:46,639
and and in order to avoid these trivial

161
00:05:46,639 --> 00:05:48,639
attacks where the adversary simply

162
00:05:48,639 --> 00:05:50,639
gives a result which does not correspond

163
00:05:50,639 --> 00:05:51,680
to the

164
00:05:51,680 --> 00:05:54,800
score of the model evaluator over its

165
00:05:54,800 --> 00:05:55,360
data

166
00:05:55,360 --> 00:05:57,440
what we do is we build a cryptographic

167
00:05:57,440 --> 00:05:59,680
proof

168
00:05:59,680 --> 00:06:02,639
that convinces the verifier in this case

169
00:06:02,639 --> 00:06:03,919
in this case the server

170
00:06:03,919 --> 00:06:07,039
that a certain score is the result of

171
00:06:07,039 --> 00:06:12,240
um a given of some some private data

172
00:06:12,240 --> 00:06:15,199
evaluated over the model chosen by the

173
00:06:15,199 --> 00:06:16,080
by the server

174
00:06:16,080 --> 00:06:18,000
so basically the server defines a model

175
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:20,319
which is a model that we train and and

176
00:06:20,319 --> 00:06:21,759
then the proof

177
00:06:21,759 --> 00:06:23,520
that the user simply generates a proof

178
00:06:23,520 --> 00:06:25,199
of this score is

179
00:06:25,199 --> 00:06:27,919
uh the result of your model being

180
00:06:27,919 --> 00:06:29,840
evaluated over my data

181
00:06:29,840 --> 00:06:32,720
and some particular properties of this

182
00:06:32,720 --> 00:06:34,080
type of proof is that it does

183
00:06:34,080 --> 00:06:36,080
not disclose any information about the

184
00:06:36,080 --> 00:06:38,000
input data mainly it does not disclose

185
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:39,520
any information about the

186
00:06:39,520 --> 00:06:41,840
the input sensors that proof is sent to

187
00:06:41,840 --> 00:06:43,039
the verifier the

188
00:06:43,039 --> 00:06:44,479
to the server the server verifies the

189
00:06:44,479 --> 00:06:46,800
proof and is convinced that the score

190
00:06:46,800 --> 00:06:49,039
is uh the computation that we just

191
00:06:49,039 --> 00:06:50,880
discussed and if the score is

192
00:06:50,880 --> 00:06:52,479
above or below a threshold then it can

193
00:06:52,479 --> 00:06:54,800
take the the decision of whether

194
00:06:54,800 --> 00:06:58,560
this is a human this is not a human

195
00:06:58,639 --> 00:07:00,240
again this has not been the first time

196
00:07:00,240 --> 00:07:02,479
that it has been um

197
00:07:02,479 --> 00:07:06,240
that it has been researched in in the

198
00:07:06,240 --> 00:07:06,960
literature

199
00:07:06,960 --> 00:07:08,319
and as a matter of fact there are other

200
00:07:08,319 --> 00:07:11,199
previous works that um

201
00:07:11,199 --> 00:07:13,840
studied the possibility of evaluating a

202
00:07:13,840 --> 00:07:15,599
model locally and then only sending a

203
00:07:15,599 --> 00:07:17,440
proof of correct evaluation

204
00:07:17,440 --> 00:07:20,000
however the concerns of these problems

205
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:20,560
of this

206
00:07:20,560 --> 00:07:24,639
of these of these works is that the

207
00:07:24,639 --> 00:07:27,039
computational requirements for the

208
00:07:27,039 --> 00:07:27,840
prover

209
00:07:27,840 --> 00:07:30,319
are way too high for us to evaluate the

210
00:07:30,319 --> 00:07:30,880
modern

211
00:07:30,880 --> 00:07:33,520
correctness in a mobile device so they

212
00:07:33,520 --> 00:07:34,240
they are not

213
00:07:34,240 --> 00:07:36,720
um useful for our use case and we need

214
00:07:36,720 --> 00:07:38,000
to build our own

215
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:41,120
addock cryptographic proof

216
00:07:41,120 --> 00:07:45,120
so how do we train our model

217
00:07:45,120 --> 00:07:47,840
to do so we slightly modify modified the

218
00:07:47,840 --> 00:07:50,560
brave browser such that it

219
00:07:50,560 --> 00:07:53,919
stored data after

220
00:07:53,919 --> 00:07:56,560
touch events were triggered and then we

221
00:07:56,560 --> 00:07:57,680
used the data to

222
00:07:57,680 --> 00:07:59,680
train the model so of course this was

223
00:07:59,680 --> 00:08:00,960
not done over the

224
00:08:00,960 --> 00:08:03,440
main browser but rather over non-public

225
00:08:03,440 --> 00:08:04,560
brave browser

226
00:08:04,560 --> 00:08:06,560
modification which we shared with 10

227
00:08:06,560 --> 00:08:07,680
volunteers

228
00:08:07,680 --> 00:08:10,879
um and the app was used for more than 20

229
00:08:10,879 --> 00:08:11,520
days

230
00:08:11,520 --> 00:08:14,319
for normal browsing activity so with

231
00:08:14,319 --> 00:08:15,680
that data together with

232
00:08:15,680 --> 00:08:18,879
uh automated data which would

233
00:08:18,879 --> 00:08:22,080
mimic the the the the

234
00:08:22,080 --> 00:08:24,560
actions triggered by bots we trained

235
00:08:24,560 --> 00:08:27,680
different classifiers

236
00:08:27,680 --> 00:08:29,840
and then we used two scores to determine

237
00:08:29,840 --> 00:08:30,720
which was the

238
00:08:30,720 --> 00:08:34,159
the most appealing classifier for our

239
00:08:34,159 --> 00:08:34,958
use case

240
00:08:34,958 --> 00:08:37,919
one is a f1 score because our our data

241
00:08:37,919 --> 00:08:39,440
set at the end was unbalanced

242
00:08:39,440 --> 00:08:40,719
and then the other one is the recall

243
00:08:40,719 --> 00:08:42,719
because what we are interested in

244
00:08:42,719 --> 00:08:46,480
after all is knowing how many

245
00:08:46,480 --> 00:08:49,200
how many bots do we detect out of all

246
00:08:49,200 --> 00:08:51,200
the body vents

247
00:08:51,200 --> 00:08:54,800
um however those those were not the only

248
00:08:54,800 --> 00:08:59,279
two um factors that made us choose one

249
00:08:59,279 --> 00:09:00,320
classifier or

250
00:09:00,320 --> 00:09:02,240
another because we also need to build

251
00:09:02,240 --> 00:09:04,320
this cryptographic proof so ideally we

252
00:09:04,320 --> 00:09:06,000
would use a classifier that

253
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:08,080
uh building this cryptographic tool is

254
00:09:08,080 --> 00:09:09,360
as simple as possible and

255
00:09:09,360 --> 00:09:10,959
for instance decision trees or random

256
00:09:10,959 --> 00:09:13,360
forest what you need to do in order to

257
00:09:13,360 --> 00:09:14,240
evaluate it

258
00:09:14,240 --> 00:09:16,320
privately is that you need to go through

259
00:09:16,320 --> 00:09:18,000
the different branches and constantly

260
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:19,040
prove that the

261
00:09:19,040 --> 00:09:21,040
path that you're taking is the correct

262
00:09:21,040 --> 00:09:23,200
one and to do so we needed to

263
00:09:23,200 --> 00:09:26,560
use several range proofs which turns out

264
00:09:26,560 --> 00:09:29,760
to be not very efficient uh at the

265
00:09:29,760 --> 00:09:31,440
level of requirement that the random

266
00:09:31,440 --> 00:09:33,680
forest or decision trees um

267
00:09:33,680 --> 00:09:35,680
request so the number of range proofs

268
00:09:35,680 --> 00:09:37,760
for those type of classifiers were way

269
00:09:37,760 --> 00:09:38,880
too high for

270
00:09:38,880 --> 00:09:42,000
generating a viable solution for mobile

271
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:43,200
devices

272
00:09:43,200 --> 00:09:45,360
another example are neural networks with

273
00:09:45,360 --> 00:09:46,640
regular activation

274
00:09:46,640 --> 00:09:48,399
so non-linear activation functions

275
00:09:48,399 --> 00:09:50,959
whether rail or any other

276
00:09:50,959 --> 00:09:54,640
as is after every matrix

277
00:09:54,640 --> 00:09:57,200
operation you need to evaluate a

278
00:09:57,200 --> 00:09:58,720
non-linear function

279
00:09:58,720 --> 00:10:01,519
then the all of this adds up and the

280
00:10:01,519 --> 00:10:02,880
resulting

281
00:10:02,880 --> 00:10:05,120
computational overhead that we cause the

282
00:10:05,120 --> 00:10:06,800
user is way too high for

283
00:10:06,800 --> 00:10:10,000
for our standards so

284
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:12,160
so yeah we have that we took that into

285
00:10:12,160 --> 00:10:14,079
account as well how easy it is to build

286
00:10:14,079 --> 00:10:15,839
a cryptographic proof and we concluded

287
00:10:15,839 --> 00:10:17,440
that the best solution or the best

288
00:10:17,440 --> 00:10:18,079
classifier

289
00:10:18,079 --> 00:10:22,800
was the svm the svm with a linear kernel

290
00:10:22,800 --> 00:10:27,519
as uh as the scores were reasonable

291
00:10:27,519 --> 00:10:30,399
reasonably high and and overhead caused

292
00:10:30,399 --> 00:10:33,920
by this mechanism was the lowest

293
00:10:33,920 --> 00:10:36,959
so proving correctness how how do we

294
00:10:36,959 --> 00:10:40,079
prove or what are the goals for

295
00:10:40,079 --> 00:10:42,320
for the user proving correctness so

296
00:10:42,320 --> 00:10:43,120
first of all

297
00:10:43,120 --> 00:10:46,000
we want to drain as less battery as

298
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:46,959
possible

299
00:10:46,959 --> 00:10:49,519
we want this to happen in a short period

300
00:10:49,519 --> 00:10:50,880
of time because at the end

301
00:10:50,880 --> 00:10:52,320
that period of time is the time that the

302
00:10:52,320 --> 00:10:53,680
user is going to have to be waiting

303
00:10:53,680 --> 00:10:54,240
until

304
00:10:54,240 --> 00:10:57,760
proving that it is human and finally

305
00:10:57,760 --> 00:11:01,279
we want the the communication complexity

306
00:11:01,279 --> 00:11:02,399
to be low

307
00:11:02,399 --> 00:11:04,160
after all this is aimed at mobile

308
00:11:04,160 --> 00:11:06,720
devices and not everyone not all users

309
00:11:06,720 --> 00:11:09,680
have infinite data data plans so

310
00:11:09,680 --> 00:11:12,839
reducing the communication overhead is

311
00:11:12,839 --> 00:11:14,560
crucial

312
00:11:14,560 --> 00:11:17,839
to build this proof which we named zika

313
00:11:17,839 --> 00:11:18,399
svm

314
00:11:18,399 --> 00:11:20,959
because um zk stands for zero knowledge

315
00:11:20,959 --> 00:11:21,760
which we'll see

316
00:11:21,760 --> 00:11:24,399
in in a second what it means uh so to

317
00:11:24,399 --> 00:11:24,800
build

318
00:11:24,800 --> 00:11:27,519
zika svm we use two foundational

319
00:11:27,519 --> 00:11:28,320
building blocks

320
00:11:28,320 --> 00:11:29,760
on the one side we use zero knowledge

321
00:11:29,760 --> 00:11:31,120
proofs and then we use commitment

322
00:11:31,120 --> 00:11:32,079
schemes

323
00:11:32,079 --> 00:11:35,360
so zero knowledge proof is

324
00:11:35,360 --> 00:11:36,959
a bit on the lines of what we discussed

325
00:11:36,959 --> 00:11:38,399
before is a proof

326
00:11:38,399 --> 00:11:40,079
that allows a prover to convince a

327
00:11:40,079 --> 00:11:42,720
verifier of a particular statement

328
00:11:42,720 --> 00:11:45,360
without disclosing any other information

329
00:11:45,360 --> 00:11:46,320
other than the fact

330
00:11:46,320 --> 00:11:48,720
that the statement is true so for the

331
00:11:48,720 --> 00:11:51,519
more generic case of zksvm this would be

332
00:11:51,519 --> 00:11:54,240
i am me as a prover i'm capable of

333
00:11:54,240 --> 00:11:56,399
proving that this is the score

334
00:11:56,399 --> 00:11:59,200
related to the svm model evaluated over

335
00:11:59,200 --> 00:12:00,240
this private data

336
00:12:00,240 --> 00:12:02,639
without disclosing any information about

337
00:12:02,639 --> 00:12:04,560
private data itself

338
00:12:04,560 --> 00:12:08,160
however to build the more generic zks vm

339
00:12:08,160 --> 00:12:11,760
oh my video just got blocked

340
00:12:11,760 --> 00:12:13,200
okay so the zero knowledge proves that

341
00:12:13,200 --> 00:12:14,959
we used to build zika svm proof

342
00:12:14,959 --> 00:12:16,480
statements which are a bit more granular

343
00:12:16,480 --> 00:12:17,680
than this

344
00:12:17,680 --> 00:12:20,000
but the idea is the same and we use

345
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:21,839
several proofs that we list

346
00:12:21,839 --> 00:12:24,800
and we explain in the paper but the main

347
00:12:24,800 --> 00:12:26,560
proof that we use

348
00:12:26,560 --> 00:12:28,800
is one to prove that c is the inner

349
00:12:28,800 --> 00:12:31,279
product of two vectors a and b

350
00:12:31,279 --> 00:12:33,200
and this proof that we use comes from a

351
00:12:33,200 --> 00:12:35,519
paper of bonds at al which was presented

352
00:12:35,519 --> 00:12:37,360
in snp 2018

353
00:12:37,360 --> 00:12:39,200
in which they present an inner product

354
00:12:39,200 --> 00:12:41,200
proof that convinces about the statement

355
00:12:41,200 --> 00:12:42,639
mainly the inner product of a and b

356
00:12:42,639 --> 00:12:45,040
is equal to c which has communication

357
00:12:45,040 --> 00:12:46,000
complexity

358
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:48,560
logarithmic with respect to the size of

359
00:12:48,560 --> 00:12:49,360
the vector

360
00:12:49,360 --> 00:12:51,040
this is very important for us because we

361
00:12:51,040 --> 00:12:52,639
need to reduce the communication

362
00:12:52,639 --> 00:12:54,160
complexity as much as possible

363
00:12:54,160 --> 00:12:56,000
and given that our vectors are large

364
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:57,600
having a super linear communication

365
00:12:57,600 --> 00:12:59,120
complexity for this statement

366
00:12:59,120 --> 00:13:01,680
is of utter importance however in the

367
00:13:01,680 --> 00:13:02,320
paper of

368
00:13:02,320 --> 00:13:05,680
boon setal they didn't require

369
00:13:05,680 --> 00:13:07,680
the information of the vectors or the

370
00:13:07,680 --> 00:13:08,880
result to remain

371
00:13:08,880 --> 00:13:12,480
private so basically they they presented

372
00:13:12,480 --> 00:13:14,800
a inner product proof with the dot which

373
00:13:14,800 --> 00:13:16,720
did not have the zero knowledge property

374
00:13:16,720 --> 00:13:18,480
in our paper we make the necessary

375
00:13:18,480 --> 00:13:19,920
changes in order to make it zero

376
00:13:19,920 --> 00:13:21,440
knowledge and we also prove that

377
00:13:21,440 --> 00:13:24,000
indeed that converts it in zero

378
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:24,959
knowledge

379
00:13:24,959 --> 00:13:27,519
um the second building so yeah stamp

380
00:13:27,519 --> 00:13:29,360
zero knowledge the second building block

381
00:13:29,360 --> 00:13:32,000
um are commitment schemes which is

382
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:33,360
basically a cryptographic

383
00:13:33,360 --> 00:13:35,600
primitive that allows an entity to

384
00:13:35,600 --> 00:13:36,800
commit to a value

385
00:13:36,800 --> 00:13:38,720
without having to disclose it and

386
00:13:38,720 --> 00:13:39,839
ensuring that

387
00:13:39,839 --> 00:13:41,519
it cannot change its mind or change the

388
00:13:41,519 --> 00:13:44,320
value thereafter

389
00:13:44,320 --> 00:13:46,720
what we commit in our in our scheme are

390
00:13:46,720 --> 00:13:48,079
the vectors so again we need a

391
00:13:48,079 --> 00:13:49,360
commitment scheme that

392
00:13:49,360 --> 00:13:51,680
that commits to the vectors in in as

393
00:13:51,680 --> 00:13:53,199
compact as possible

394
00:13:53,199 --> 00:13:56,800
uh the the perfect mechanism here

395
00:13:56,800 --> 00:13:59,120
or the perfect construction is one of

396
00:13:59,120 --> 00:14:00,399
pedersen commitments

397
00:14:00,399 --> 00:14:02,480
which allow us to commit to a full

398
00:14:02,480 --> 00:14:04,800
vector into a single elliptic curve

399
00:14:04,800 --> 00:14:07,920
point and in our case with the curve

400
00:14:07,920 --> 00:14:08,880
that we use

401
00:14:08,880 --> 00:14:11,360
this results in 32 bytes per commitment

402
00:14:11,360 --> 00:14:12,800
regardless of how large

403
00:14:12,800 --> 00:14:16,160
the vector is and another crucial

404
00:14:16,160 --> 00:14:17,920
property of petals and commitments

405
00:14:17,920 --> 00:14:19,839
is that it is additively homomorphic

406
00:14:19,839 --> 00:14:21,199
meaning that the commitment

407
00:14:21,199 --> 00:14:23,680
of a vector a plus the commitment of a

408
00:14:23,680 --> 00:14:24,399
vector b

409
00:14:24,399 --> 00:14:27,199
equals the element wise so the

410
00:14:27,199 --> 00:14:28,880
commitment of the element-wise addition

411
00:14:28,880 --> 00:14:31,440
of these two vectors

412
00:14:31,440 --> 00:14:33,120
so by using these two building blocks we

413
00:14:33,120 --> 00:14:35,920
are capable of building zks vm mainly we

414
00:14:35,920 --> 00:14:37,519
are capable of proving

415
00:14:37,519 --> 00:14:40,880
that a particular score is the result of

416
00:14:40,880 --> 00:14:42,000
evaluating

417
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:44,959
an svm model over a committed vector or

418
00:14:44,959 --> 00:14:47,199
over multiple committed vectors

419
00:14:47,199 --> 00:14:50,000
um in the paper we proved that zika svm

420
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:52,079
provides data privacy meaning that

421
00:14:52,079 --> 00:14:54,720
no information whatsoever of the sensor

422
00:14:54,720 --> 00:14:55,279
data

423
00:14:55,279 --> 00:14:57,839
is leaked other than the fact that it

424
00:14:57,839 --> 00:14:59,920
generates a particular score

425
00:14:59,920 --> 00:15:02,800
similarly we also prove that zika svm

426
00:15:02,800 --> 00:15:04,720
provides verifiability

427
00:15:04,720 --> 00:15:07,760
meaning that the verifier is convinced

428
00:15:07,760 --> 00:15:08,959
that the score

429
00:15:08,959 --> 00:15:12,000
is a result of evaluating a particular

430
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:15,360
svm model to some list

431
00:15:15,360 --> 00:15:18,160
of committed vectors so it's important

432
00:15:18,160 --> 00:15:19,440
to note here that

433
00:15:19,440 --> 00:15:22,000
zks vm does not provide any guarantees

434
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:23,519
of the origin of the data

435
00:15:23,519 --> 00:15:26,560
it only provides guarantees that the

436
00:15:26,560 --> 00:15:28,560
score corresponds to the evaluation of a

437
00:15:28,560 --> 00:15:30,000
particular svm

438
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:33,600
to a list of committed vectors

439
00:15:33,600 --> 00:15:37,360
um so implemented this in rust for

440
00:15:37,360 --> 00:15:40,560
zika svm and using android sdk for

441
00:15:40,560 --> 00:15:44,560
the broader zk sense application

442
00:15:44,560 --> 00:15:46,639
and we evaluated over two devices a

443
00:15:46,639 --> 00:15:48,639
mid-and device samsung galaxy s9 and a

444
00:15:48,639 --> 00:15:50,800
low-end device samsung galaxy j3

445
00:15:50,800 --> 00:15:52,720
so the latter is connected to battery

446
00:15:52,720 --> 00:15:55,120
lab which allowed us to have

447
00:15:55,120 --> 00:15:57,920
more precise information about the

448
00:15:57,920 --> 00:15:58,959
battery consumption

449
00:15:58,959 --> 00:16:01,600
the first galaxy s9 was not connected

450
00:16:01,600 --> 00:16:02,560
but we expect

451
00:16:02,560 --> 00:16:04,880
the battery consumption to be lower than

452
00:16:04,880 --> 00:16:07,279
the one of the galaxy j3 for two reasons

453
00:16:07,279 --> 00:16:08,000
first

454
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:11,199
the cpu computation is much lower for

455
00:16:11,199 --> 00:16:12,959
the case of the mid-end device

456
00:16:12,959 --> 00:16:15,759
and also the computation time is much

457
00:16:15,759 --> 00:16:17,920
lower by an order of magnitude lower

458
00:16:17,920 --> 00:16:21,199
than j3 not only that but the battery of

459
00:16:21,199 --> 00:16:22,720
the galaxy s9 is also

460
00:16:22,720 --> 00:16:24,399
it contains more amperage than the

461
00:16:24,399 --> 00:16:25,839
galaxy j3 so

462
00:16:25,839 --> 00:16:27,920
the percentage of battery wasted will be

463
00:16:27,920 --> 00:16:28,959
even lower

464
00:16:28,959 --> 00:16:33,920
nonetheless 0.2 percent is an acceptable

465
00:16:33,920 --> 00:16:36,160
battery consumption amount for this type

466
00:16:36,160 --> 00:16:37,759
of attestation

467
00:16:37,759 --> 00:16:40,240
however we see that in the in the

468
00:16:40,240 --> 00:16:41,920
running time

469
00:16:41,920 --> 00:16:43,519
three seconds for galaxy s9 is

470
00:16:43,519 --> 00:16:46,399
acceptable 40 seconds for galaxy j3

471
00:16:46,399 --> 00:16:49,440
is not in the limits that we consider

472
00:16:49,440 --> 00:16:51,759
valid for a testing humanness

473
00:16:51,759 --> 00:16:53,120
communication bandwidth

474
00:16:53,120 --> 00:16:55,360
is good for both it just contains the

475
00:16:55,360 --> 00:16:56,800
size of the proof

476
00:16:56,800 --> 00:17:01,279
um and yeah so with these results we

477
00:17:01,279 --> 00:17:03,839
we show that we presented a seamless

478
00:17:03,839 --> 00:17:05,760
human attestation mechanism which

479
00:17:05,760 --> 00:17:08,400
prevents provides privacy to the user

480
00:17:08,400 --> 00:17:10,640
and convinces the verifier that

481
00:17:10,640 --> 00:17:12,480
a score is indeed the result of

482
00:17:12,480 --> 00:17:14,319
evaluating a particular svm

483
00:17:14,319 --> 00:17:16,799
model so we presented a zero knowledge

484
00:17:16,799 --> 00:17:19,199
proof of ml evaluation

485
00:17:19,199 --> 00:17:21,280
it is small and battery efficient for

486
00:17:21,280 --> 00:17:22,319
both mid

487
00:17:22,319 --> 00:17:24,640
and low end devices however we saw that

488
00:17:24,640 --> 00:17:26,079
it is a bit too slow for

489
00:17:26,079 --> 00:17:29,520
low end devices um

490
00:17:29,520 --> 00:17:31,520
we also didn't resolve the problem of

491
00:17:31,520 --> 00:17:32,960
data origin and we explored the

492
00:17:32,960 --> 00:17:34,640
possibility of using

493
00:17:34,640 --> 00:17:37,679
trusted hardware but this is not widely

494
00:17:37,679 --> 00:17:40,400
in use yet so it was not a possibility

495
00:17:40,400 --> 00:17:41,760
for our solution

496
00:17:41,760 --> 00:17:43,360
similarly we want to improve the ml

497
00:17:43,360 --> 00:17:44,880
model to

498
00:17:44,880 --> 00:17:47,919
reach a broader audience in which

499
00:17:47,919 --> 00:17:50,240
for instance visually impaired users are

500
00:17:50,240 --> 00:17:52,160
capable of still using this attestation

501
00:17:52,160 --> 00:17:53,280
mechanism by

502
00:17:53,280 --> 00:17:56,000
leveraging the the sensor data when for

503
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:58,240
instance the volume or power buttons are

504
00:17:58,240 --> 00:17:59,120
triggered which

505
00:17:59,120 --> 00:18:01,840
are usually the buttons used mostly by

506
00:18:01,840 --> 00:18:02,960
these users to

507
00:18:02,960 --> 00:18:05,440
navigate through through the smartphone

508
00:18:05,440 --> 00:18:07,039
so i hope you enjoyed the presentation

509
00:18:07,039 --> 00:18:10,400
sorry i rushed up and i'm happy for any

510
00:18:10,400 --> 00:18:11,200
any question

511
00:18:11,200 --> 00:18:13,919
thank you
