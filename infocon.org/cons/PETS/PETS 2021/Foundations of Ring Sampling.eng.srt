00:00:00,480 --> 00:00:02,879
hello everyone and welcome to the talk

2
00:00:02,879 --> 00:00:03,280
about

3
00:00:03,280 --> 00:00:05,839
foundations of ring sampling i am

4
00:00:05,839 --> 00:00:08,000
victoria ronge and this is joint work

5
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:09,920
with christophe egger russell ly

6
00:00:09,920 --> 00:00:13,280
dominic schroeder and hubian

7
00:00:13,280 --> 00:00:16,000
first of all what rings are we talking

8
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:17,520
about

9
00:00:17,520 --> 00:00:20,080
the rings we're talking about come from

10
00:00:20,080 --> 00:00:21,760
ring signatures

11
00:00:21,760 --> 00:00:24,240
so on the one side we have a ring with

12
00:00:24,240 --> 00:00:25,760
alice bob and carol

13
00:00:25,760 --> 00:00:29,199
where alice is signing

14
00:00:29,199 --> 00:00:32,000
on the other side we have another ring

15
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:34,399
also with alice bob and carol

16
00:00:34,399 --> 00:00:37,760
but now carol is the one who is signing

17
00:00:37,760 --> 00:00:40,000
and now a ring signature wants to make

18
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:41,200
sure

19
00:00:41,200 --> 00:00:44,160
that i cannot tell from the outside if

20
00:00:44,160 --> 00:00:46,000
alice is the actual signer

21
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:50,079
or if carol is the actual signer

22
00:00:51,360 --> 00:00:53,680
and why we are talking about ring

23
00:00:53,680 --> 00:00:55,520
sampling

24
00:00:55,520 --> 00:00:58,719
is that for the ring

25
00:00:58,719 --> 00:01:01,280
at least in some contexts like anonymous

26
00:01:01,280 --> 00:01:03,840
cryptocurrencies

27
00:01:03,840 --> 00:01:07,119
i don't use every possible sign on their

28
00:01:07,119 --> 00:01:08,159
wrist

29
00:01:08,159 --> 00:01:10,400
but i have to make a certain selection

30
00:01:10,400 --> 00:01:13,200
of possible signers

31
00:01:13,200 --> 00:01:16,080
and this selection process is what we

32
00:01:16,080 --> 00:01:16,560
call

33
00:01:16,560 --> 00:01:19,360
ring sampling

34
00:01:21,040 --> 00:01:25,680
now the most common cryptocurrency with

35
00:01:25,680 --> 00:01:29,360
ring signatures is monero

36
00:01:29,840 --> 00:01:32,320
and they do exactly what we do with ring

37
00:01:32,320 --> 00:01:34,560
signatures they hide the actual

38
00:01:34,560 --> 00:01:37,439
spenders we call them spenders as they

39
00:01:37,439 --> 00:01:40,799
spend the money not signers anymore

40
00:01:40,799 --> 00:01:43,119
and hide them within a set of decoys so

41
00:01:43,119 --> 00:01:45,600
the other ring members

42
00:01:45,600 --> 00:01:48,159
and this decoy selection was prior to

43
00:01:48,159 --> 00:01:48,720
april

44
00:01:48,720 --> 00:01:52,799
2015 done by uniformly choosing other

45
00:01:52,799 --> 00:01:54,799
ring members

46
00:01:54,799 --> 00:01:58,320
so when i want to form a ring i

47
00:01:58,320 --> 00:02:01,920
fix my ring size and then uniformly

48
00:02:01,920 --> 00:02:05,040
choose other ring members but this

49
00:02:05,040 --> 00:02:08,239
has the problem that the newest account

50
00:02:08,239 --> 00:02:11,680
according to age within the ring

51
00:02:11,680 --> 00:02:13,599
has the most probability to be the

52
00:02:13,599 --> 00:02:15,280
actual spender

53
00:02:15,280 --> 00:02:17,599
the reason for that is older accounts

54
00:02:17,599 --> 00:02:20,879
that have been there for quite some time

55
00:02:20,879 --> 00:02:23,760
had a much larger chance to already

56
00:02:23,760 --> 00:02:24,400
really

57
00:02:24,400 --> 00:02:28,720
spend and not just be decoys

58
00:02:29,040 --> 00:02:32,239
so after some alteration finally

59
00:02:32,239 --> 00:02:35,440
decoy selection from fall 2018 on is now

60
00:02:35,440 --> 00:02:37,680
done by a gamma distribution

61
00:02:37,680 --> 00:02:40,800
and we will show that if

62
00:02:40,800 --> 00:02:44,160
the probability that someone really

63
00:02:44,160 --> 00:02:47,599
is designer and therefore

64
00:02:47,599 --> 00:02:50,239
is the one who wants to create a ring in

65
00:02:50,239 --> 00:02:54,319
that sense at a certain point in time

66
00:02:54,319 --> 00:02:57,120
then it's actually good to use this

67
00:02:57,120 --> 00:02:59,760
distribution

68
00:03:00,640 --> 00:03:02,159
how do they come up with the gamma

69
00:03:02,159 --> 00:03:05,040
distribution there is a paper by muzad

70
00:03:05,040 --> 00:03:05,680
idle

71
00:03:05,680 --> 00:03:08,480
where they analyzed bitcoin data and

72
00:03:08,480 --> 00:03:10,720
also monero data

73
00:03:10,720 --> 00:03:13,280
which is older where they could deduce

74
00:03:13,280 --> 00:03:16,000
some actual signus

75
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:19,440
and from that they fitted

76
00:03:19,440 --> 00:03:24,000
a gamma distribution into that data

77
00:03:25,599 --> 00:03:29,200
but now what do we mean by

78
00:03:29,200 --> 00:03:32,959
the sign distribution is good

79
00:03:32,959 --> 00:03:36,400
and how do we define this

80
00:03:37,519 --> 00:03:41,519
so in other areas we use

81
00:03:41,519 --> 00:03:45,440
already entropy to define such things

82
00:03:45,440 --> 00:03:48,560
this is used in mixnets and also in

83
00:03:48,560 --> 00:03:52,640
anonymous communication for example

84
00:03:52,640 --> 00:03:54,879
and this provides us a number that we

85
00:03:54,879 --> 00:03:56,159
can actually compare

86
00:03:56,159 --> 00:03:59,200
between different ring samplers

87
00:03:59,200 --> 00:04:02,159
and it also is similar to the advantage

88
00:04:02,159 --> 00:04:05,120
we normally have in cryptographic games

89
00:04:05,120 --> 00:04:08,400
so when we say we have a certain

90
00:04:08,400 --> 00:04:09,360
anonymity

91
00:04:09,360 --> 00:04:12,080
according to our entropy we can

92
00:04:12,080 --> 00:04:13,680
translate that

93
00:04:13,680 --> 00:04:16,079
that the adversary has a certain

94
00:04:16,079 --> 00:04:18,000
advantage

95
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:22,079
when it has to decide who is the actual

96
00:04:22,079 --> 00:04:25,280
spender within the ring

97
00:04:25,840 --> 00:04:29,199
and to do that we use guessing

98
00:04:29,199 --> 00:04:30,160
probability

99
00:04:30,160 --> 00:04:32,080
which in the end will lead us to min

100
00:04:32,080 --> 00:04:33,600
entropy

101
00:04:33,600 --> 00:04:35,759
so my guessing probability of a random

102
00:04:35,759 --> 00:04:37,280
variable x

103
00:04:37,280 --> 00:04:39,759
are simply the maximum of all

104
00:04:39,759 --> 00:04:41,600
probabilities

105
00:04:41,600 --> 00:04:45,919
which values x can take

106
00:04:45,919 --> 00:04:50,000
and in our context this mean we have a

107
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:53,280
set of spenders and we just have a look

108
00:04:53,280 --> 00:04:54,080
at

109
00:04:54,080 --> 00:04:56,080
which of the spenders is the most likely

110
00:04:56,080 --> 00:04:58,320
one

111
00:04:58,400 --> 00:05:00,880
and with discussing probability we can

112
00:05:00,880 --> 00:05:01,520
build the

113
00:05:01,520 --> 00:05:05,039
average conditional guessing probability

114
00:05:05,039 --> 00:05:08,080
of a random variable x given y

115
00:05:08,080 --> 00:05:11,520
and this is the sum over all possible

116
00:05:11,520 --> 00:05:15,400
values y can take multiplied with the

117
00:05:15,400 --> 00:05:18,560
probabilities for my x

118
00:05:18,560 --> 00:05:22,000
depending on this particular y

119
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:25,280
and again in our context we have x

120
00:05:25,280 --> 00:05:28,400
as the spanner or the splendas

121
00:05:28,400 --> 00:05:32,160
and y is the ring so we want to know the

122
00:05:32,160 --> 00:05:33,120
probability

123
00:05:33,120 --> 00:05:36,000
given a ring

124
00:05:36,160 --> 00:05:39,600
that each of the participants in the

125
00:05:39,600 --> 00:05:40,000
ring

126
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:42,960
is the actual spanner and we sum over

127
00:05:42,960 --> 00:05:43,280
all

128
00:05:43,280 --> 00:05:46,479
possible rings which contain the actual

129
00:05:46,479 --> 00:05:49,120
spanner

130
00:05:49,280 --> 00:05:50,960
and this is a somewhat pessimistic

131
00:05:50,960 --> 00:05:53,199
measure because we always take the

132
00:05:53,199 --> 00:05:55,199
maximum

133
00:05:55,199 --> 00:05:57,520
and we also assume that we have honest

134
00:05:57,520 --> 00:05:58,880
vendors

135
00:05:58,880 --> 00:06:02,160
the reason why we assume that is in

136
00:06:02,160 --> 00:06:05,280
most of the cases it's the best

137
00:06:05,280 --> 00:06:07,759
idea for an honest spender to choose

138
00:06:07,759 --> 00:06:10,240
according to the distribution

139
00:06:10,240 --> 00:06:12,639
given by the system because it is

140
00:06:12,639 --> 00:06:13,520
assumed that

141
00:06:13,520 --> 00:06:16,400
the system means well for everyone

142
00:06:16,400 --> 00:06:18,960
basically

143
00:06:19,360 --> 00:06:22,400
and from this guessing entity

144
00:06:22,400 --> 00:06:26,639
we get our min entropy of x

145
00:06:26,639 --> 00:06:28,800
and the min entropy of a random variable

146
00:06:28,800 --> 00:06:31,280
x is defined as the negative logarithm

147
00:06:31,280 --> 00:06:35,600
of the guessing probability of x

148
00:06:35,600 --> 00:06:37,919
and again we can have our average

149
00:06:37,919 --> 00:06:41,440
conditional min entropy of x given y

150
00:06:41,440 --> 00:06:44,639
and this is then the negative logarithm

151
00:06:44,639 --> 00:06:49,440
of the guessing probability of x given y

152
00:06:49,440 --> 00:06:51,919
and this provides us as probabilities

153
00:06:51,919 --> 00:06:53,120
are between

154
00:06:53,120 --> 00:06:56,479
zero and one with a value

155
00:06:56,479 --> 00:06:59,680
greater than zero

156
00:07:01,680 --> 00:07:03,599
and with this now we build our new

157
00:07:03,599 --> 00:07:06,479
anonymity measure

158
00:07:06,479 --> 00:07:09,360
depending on our spenders and our ring

159
00:07:09,360 --> 00:07:10,960
sampler

160
00:07:10,960 --> 00:07:14,720
and we say this is the min entropy

161
00:07:14,720 --> 00:07:17,199
of s conditioned of the output of the

162
00:07:17,199 --> 00:07:18,319
ring sampler

163
00:07:18,319 --> 00:07:22,080
when input with s

164
00:07:24,240 --> 00:07:27,840
this has a very nice property

165
00:07:27,840 --> 00:07:32,319
that is if we assume a distribution

166
00:07:32,319 --> 00:07:35,199
and we are slightly off with this

167
00:07:35,199 --> 00:07:37,520
distribution

168
00:07:37,520 --> 00:07:40,160
and slightly off means here that the

169
00:07:40,160 --> 00:07:41,759
linear divergence

170
00:07:41,759 --> 00:07:45,360
is smaller than a certain epsilon

171
00:07:45,360 --> 00:07:48,720
then we can show that the anonymity

172
00:07:48,720 --> 00:07:49,840
measure

173
00:07:49,840 --> 00:07:53,599
of the one distribution of s is greater

174
00:07:53,599 --> 00:07:58,400
equal the anonymity distribution

175
00:07:58,400 --> 00:08:01,120
anonymity for distribution s prime minus

176
00:08:01,120 --> 00:08:03,520
epsilon

177
00:08:03,520 --> 00:08:07,360
so when we are not exactly

178
00:08:07,360 --> 00:08:09,919
seeing the probabilities for each

179
00:08:09,919 --> 00:08:11,120
spenders but

180
00:08:11,120 --> 00:08:13,440
more or less good enough then we know

181
00:08:13,440 --> 00:08:15,759
that our anonymity measure also is not

182
00:08:15,759 --> 00:08:18,319
far off

183
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:23,520
and we can see that the measure makes

184
00:08:23,520 --> 00:08:24,000
sense

185
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:27,759
by first having a look at two edge cases

186
00:08:27,759 --> 00:08:30,319
the first edge case would be that i

187
00:08:30,319 --> 00:08:31,199
simply

188
00:08:31,199 --> 00:08:34,640
really use every possible spender within

189
00:08:34,640 --> 00:08:37,599
the universe ring signatures normally

190
00:08:37,599 --> 00:08:38,880
don't do that because of

191
00:08:38,880 --> 00:08:42,479
implementation but we could assume that

192
00:08:42,479 --> 00:08:44,399
it's possible

193
00:08:44,399 --> 00:08:46,800
and then the anonymity of such a ring

194
00:08:46,800 --> 00:08:48,240
sampler

195
00:08:48,240 --> 00:08:50,720
which is basically zigesh is the

196
00:08:50,720 --> 00:08:52,800
negative logarithm

197
00:08:52,800 --> 00:08:55,760
over the maximum of all probabilities

198
00:08:55,760 --> 00:08:57,440
for each signer

199
00:08:57,440 --> 00:09:00,000
and that's you the best we can hope off

200
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:00,480
for

201
00:09:00,480 --> 00:09:03,279
i cannot do anything better but just

202
00:09:03,279 --> 00:09:04,080
saying okay

203
00:09:04,080 --> 00:09:07,600
i i'm the most likely well done

204
00:09:07,600 --> 00:09:10,320
i am the most likely but i cannot change

205
00:09:10,320 --> 00:09:12,560
that

206
00:09:13,600 --> 00:09:15,440
and the other edge case that's the one

207
00:09:15,440 --> 00:09:17,680
sampler so my ring sampler

208
00:09:17,680 --> 00:09:21,120
for a spender always outputs just the

209
00:09:21,120 --> 00:09:22,000
spender as

210
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:26,000
ring and there of course there should be

211
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:27,680
no anonymity at all

212
00:09:27,680 --> 00:09:29,680
because if there is one ring member and

213
00:09:29,680 --> 00:09:31,519
one spender this has to be the actual

214
00:09:31,519 --> 00:09:33,839
spender

215
00:09:33,839 --> 00:09:36,399
and with our measure we get the negative

216
00:09:36,399 --> 00:09:38,480
logarithm of one

217
00:09:38,480 --> 00:09:40,560
which is zero so we know that it's a

218
00:09:40,560 --> 00:09:43,680
quite bad sample

219
00:09:44,560 --> 00:09:47,519
some intermediate cases are first the

220
00:09:47,519 --> 00:09:49,279
uniform sampler

221
00:09:49,279 --> 00:09:52,000
the uniform sampler is what i already

222
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:53,680
explained for monero we just

223
00:09:53,680 --> 00:09:56,399
sample uniformly over all possible

224
00:09:56,399 --> 00:09:59,360
spenders the ring

225
00:09:59,360 --> 00:10:02,399
this gives us some binomial coefficients

226
00:10:02,399 --> 00:10:06,880
and depending on probability for the

227
00:10:06,880 --> 00:10:11,360
actual spenders and we can see that

228
00:10:11,360 --> 00:10:13,440
if spenders are actually distributed

229
00:10:13,440 --> 00:10:16,000
uniformly

230
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:17,680
then this would be quite good with the

231
00:10:17,680 --> 00:10:20,480
uniform sampler because then we get

232
00:10:20,480 --> 00:10:23,600
the logarithm of n so of the ring size

233
00:10:23,600 --> 00:10:26,800
as anonymity and that's optimal that's

234
00:10:26,800 --> 00:10:27,519
the best

235
00:10:27,519 --> 00:10:30,240
we can hope for

236
00:10:31,519 --> 00:10:33,440
and on the other side if our

237
00:10:33,440 --> 00:10:34,800
distribution is

238
00:10:34,800 --> 00:10:38,320
exponentially then this anonymity tends

239
00:10:38,320 --> 00:10:39,440
to zero

240
00:10:39,440 --> 00:10:44,160
so it's quite bad this again shows us

241
00:10:44,160 --> 00:10:46,640
if my idea of what should be the

242
00:10:46,640 --> 00:10:47,680
distribution and

243
00:10:47,680 --> 00:10:50,800
i'm choosing a sample accordingly is

244
00:10:50,800 --> 00:10:53,519
close to each other my anonymity gets

245
00:10:53,519 --> 00:10:54,560
good otherwise

246
00:10:54,560 --> 00:10:58,560
that and we can see that also

247
00:10:58,560 --> 00:11:01,120
if we compare some data so this is

248
00:11:01,120 --> 00:11:01,839
produced

249
00:11:01,839 --> 00:11:05,040
data in the sense that we

250
00:11:05,040 --> 00:11:08,079
just draw a lot of sample rings

251
00:11:08,079 --> 00:11:11,920
with the according distributions

252
00:11:12,160 --> 00:11:15,600
and we have our uniform distribution

253
00:11:15,600 --> 00:11:17,680
for the spenders which of course are

254
00:11:17,680 --> 00:11:20,079
optimal

255
00:11:20,079 --> 00:11:22,959
and then we use a baseline distribution

256
00:11:22,959 --> 00:11:23,360
for

257
00:11:23,360 --> 00:11:26,480
different universe sizes t

258
00:11:26,480 --> 00:11:29,200
and we see that with increasing universe

259
00:11:29,200 --> 00:11:30,160
size

260
00:11:30,160 --> 00:11:33,920
the anonymity even gets worse

261
00:11:33,920 --> 00:11:35,760
and what do we mean by baseline

262
00:11:35,760 --> 00:11:37,360
distribution

263
00:11:37,360 --> 00:11:40,880
we did the same as merced al and

264
00:11:40,880 --> 00:11:44,160
fitted a curve into bitcoin data

265
00:11:44,160 --> 00:11:46,320
but we think that a shifted pareto

266
00:11:46,320 --> 00:11:47,440
distribution is

267
00:11:47,440 --> 00:11:51,040
slightly better according to the

268
00:11:51,040 --> 00:11:54,160
values we got so instead of the gamma

269
00:11:54,160 --> 00:11:56,320
distribution we use a shifted pareto

270
00:11:56,320 --> 00:11:57,680
distribution

271
00:11:57,680 --> 00:12:00,959
which still provides kind of similar

272
00:12:00,959 --> 00:12:03,439
values

273
00:12:06,320 --> 00:12:08,480
the next sampler one could think of is

274
00:12:08,480 --> 00:12:11,120
the mimicking sampler

275
00:12:11,120 --> 00:12:14,880
that means i'm something with

276
00:12:14,880 --> 00:12:18,320
the same distribution i assume that the

277
00:12:18,320 --> 00:12:20,320
spenders have

278
00:12:20,320 --> 00:12:22,240
this is what is tried in monero

279
00:12:22,240 --> 00:12:24,880
currently with the gamma distribution

280
00:12:24,880 --> 00:12:26,800
we assume the spanners have the gamma

281
00:12:26,800 --> 00:12:28,160
distribution so we

282
00:12:28,160 --> 00:12:32,160
sample accordingly and in our paper we

283
00:12:32,160 --> 00:12:32,639
proved

284
00:12:32,639 --> 00:12:36,639
that the anonymity for such thing

285
00:12:36,639 --> 00:12:40,160
is greater equal logarithm of n half

286
00:12:40,160 --> 00:12:43,440
if my initial entropy for

287
00:12:43,440 --> 00:12:48,399
my spenders was good enough

288
00:12:49,120 --> 00:12:51,120
and now this logarithm and half might

289
00:12:51,120 --> 00:12:53,440
not sound that good

290
00:12:53,440 --> 00:12:55,600
but as i said it's a lower bound which

291
00:12:55,600 --> 00:12:58,240
we could prove

292
00:12:58,720 --> 00:13:01,440
and if we see now empirical data again

293
00:13:01,440 --> 00:13:02,320
we

294
00:13:02,320 --> 00:13:05,600
made a lot of sample runs

295
00:13:05,839 --> 00:13:09,839
both for the baseline distribution we

296
00:13:09,839 --> 00:13:10,800
found

297
00:13:10,800 --> 00:13:12,720
and for the gamma distribution monero is

298
00:13:12,720 --> 00:13:15,279
using and as well for the uniform

299
00:13:15,279 --> 00:13:17,839
distribution

300
00:13:17,839 --> 00:13:21,120
we see that when we just

301
00:13:21,120 --> 00:13:24,160
make samples it's quite

302
00:13:24,160 --> 00:13:27,600
good or near optimal with different ring

303
00:13:27,600 --> 00:13:28,560
sizes which is

304
00:13:28,560 --> 00:13:30,959
l and different universe sizes which

305
00:13:30,959 --> 00:13:34,320
again is t

306
00:13:34,320 --> 00:13:36,320
so while the proven bound is only

307
00:13:36,320 --> 00:13:39,680
logarithm half we see that in reality it

308
00:13:39,680 --> 00:13:42,959
most likely is very good

309
00:13:42,959 --> 00:13:44,560
but it's hard to achieve such a

310
00:13:44,560 --> 00:13:46,320
mimicking sampler because that would

311
00:13:46,320 --> 00:13:48,160
mean we need to know

312
00:13:48,160 --> 00:13:51,360
very well the actual distributions of

313
00:13:51,360 --> 00:13:54,079
our spenders

314
00:13:54,480 --> 00:13:57,279
and for this reason we proposed a

315
00:13:57,279 --> 00:14:00,000
partitioning sampler

316
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:01,839
the partitioning sampler does the

317
00:14:01,839 --> 00:14:03,199
following

318
00:14:03,199 --> 00:14:06,079
we first partition our universe in a

319
00:14:06,079 --> 00:14:08,240
public manner

320
00:14:08,240 --> 00:14:11,360
and for us we just say we distribute

321
00:14:11,360 --> 00:14:15,360
for h so h is when an account

322
00:14:15,360 --> 00:14:20,160
appeared in the blockchain in monero

323
00:14:21,360 --> 00:14:23,519
and we just say we have a fixed

324
00:14:23,519 --> 00:14:25,440
partition size

325
00:14:25,440 --> 00:14:30,079
starting from the genesis block

326
00:14:30,079 --> 00:14:34,399
then every partition has the same size

327
00:14:34,399 --> 00:14:36,959
and new accounts where the partition is

328
00:14:36,959 --> 00:14:38,079
not full

329
00:14:38,079 --> 00:14:41,440
so to speak have to wait a little bit

330
00:14:41,440 --> 00:14:43,519
but this seems fine because that's the

331
00:14:43,519 --> 00:14:47,360
same what currently happens in monero

332
00:14:47,920 --> 00:14:49,519
and when we now have such a auto

333
00:14:49,519 --> 00:14:51,440
partition

334
00:14:51,440 --> 00:14:54,560
we partition further into our rings

335
00:14:54,560 --> 00:14:57,120
according to some public randomness

336
00:14:57,120 --> 00:15:01,360
might be the hash over some blocks

337
00:15:01,600 --> 00:15:03,920
and with that we get equally distributed

338
00:15:03,920 --> 00:15:06,240
rings

339
00:15:07,360 --> 00:15:10,480
and these are also publicly verifiable

340
00:15:10,480 --> 00:15:15,120
so an adversary has to comply

341
00:15:15,120 --> 00:15:18,240
to the sampling process

342
00:15:18,240 --> 00:15:20,079
which makes black marble attacks a

343
00:15:20,079 --> 00:15:21,839
little bit more difficult because

344
00:15:21,839 --> 00:15:25,279
i cannot say initially

345
00:15:25,279 --> 00:15:28,560
in which ring will my black marble end

346
00:15:28,560 --> 00:15:30,719
up

347
00:15:31,040 --> 00:15:35,360
and so it's more difficult to insert it

348
00:15:37,279 --> 00:15:40,480
and this now assumes that we have a

349
00:15:40,480 --> 00:15:43,759
uniform distribution within each

350
00:15:43,759 --> 00:15:46,720
partition not over the whole universe

351
00:15:46,720 --> 00:15:47,680
but only

352
00:15:47,680 --> 00:15:51,040
inside one partition and

353
00:15:51,040 --> 00:15:54,560
this means that accounts of a

354
00:15:54,560 --> 00:15:57,360
more or less the same age which are very

355
00:15:57,360 --> 00:15:58,399
close in terms of

356
00:15:58,399 --> 00:16:02,480
age have the same probability

357
00:16:02,480 --> 00:16:05,600
and this seems reasonable because

358
00:16:05,600 --> 00:16:08,639
age is something we can determine

359
00:16:08,639 --> 00:16:11,440
but it should be the only thing we

360
00:16:11,440 --> 00:16:12,240
actually can

361
00:16:12,240 --> 00:16:16,160
determine for a spender

362
00:16:16,160 --> 00:16:18,240
so yes of course we can distinguish

363
00:16:18,240 --> 00:16:20,480
between different keys

364
00:16:20,480 --> 00:16:23,600
and between different spanners

365
00:16:23,600 --> 00:16:27,279
but this should not be

366
00:16:27,279 --> 00:16:30,880
that we can distinguish in another way

367
00:16:30,880 --> 00:16:31,600
but age

368
00:16:31,600 --> 00:16:34,399
and for age they look the same because

369
00:16:34,399 --> 00:16:36,000
they are in the same block or one to

370
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:36,399
each

371
00:16:36,399 --> 00:16:39,920
next one to the next so

372
00:16:39,920 --> 00:16:42,240
it seems reasonable that we can assume

373
00:16:42,240 --> 00:16:44,639
if the partition is small enough

374
00:16:44,639 --> 00:16:47,839
we would get a

375
00:16:47,839 --> 00:16:51,040
more or less uniform distribution and if

376
00:16:51,040 --> 00:16:53,120
we have this uniform distribution

377
00:16:53,120 --> 00:16:55,600
we also have again our perfect anonymity

378
00:16:55,600 --> 00:16:57,839
within the partition which is logarithm

379
00:16:57,839 --> 00:17:00,079
of n

380
00:17:00,079 --> 00:17:03,040
so in the end the measure works quite

381
00:17:03,040 --> 00:17:04,000
good

382
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:06,480
and if we are more or less sure that we

383
00:17:06,480 --> 00:17:08,959
have the right distribution

384
00:17:08,959 --> 00:17:11,039
we can give a quite good estimation of

385
00:17:11,039 --> 00:17:13,039
the anonymity of our sampler

386
00:17:13,039 --> 00:17:15,919
and even if we are slightly off in the

387
00:17:15,919 --> 00:17:17,760
end that's not too bad because our

388
00:17:17,760 --> 00:17:18,640
anonymity

389
00:17:18,640 --> 00:17:21,760
won't change too much get better data

390
00:17:21,760 --> 00:17:25,199
for our anonymity but by definition this

391
00:17:25,199 --> 00:17:27,679
would mean that we reduce the anonymity

392
00:17:27,679 --> 00:17:28,480
of

393
00:17:28,480 --> 00:17:32,000
current expanders so the current

394
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:34,960
existing transactions therefore on the

395
00:17:34,960 --> 00:17:36,720
one hand it would be very interesting

396
00:17:36,720 --> 00:17:38,960
on the other hand of course for the

397
00:17:38,960 --> 00:17:40,799
actual users of the cryptocurrencies

398
00:17:40,799 --> 00:17:42,400
this wouldn't be that nice

399
00:17:42,400 --> 00:17:44,240
and for this i thank you for listening

400
00:17:44,240 --> 00:17:47,840
to the talk
