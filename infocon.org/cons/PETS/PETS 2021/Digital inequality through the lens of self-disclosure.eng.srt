00:00:04,720 --> 00:00:05,040
hi

2
00:00:05,040 --> 00:00:07,680
my name is julian lee and i'm the author

3
00:00:07,680 --> 00:00:08,480
of this

4
00:00:08,480 --> 00:00:11,360
um paper and i'm here to present our

5
00:00:11,360 --> 00:00:12,240
paper called

6
00:00:12,240 --> 00:00:14,920
digital equality through the lens of

7
00:00:14,920 --> 00:00:16,800
self-disclosure we're all from penn

8
00:00:16,800 --> 00:00:17,279
state

9
00:00:17,279 --> 00:00:20,480
and i want to say thank you for

10
00:00:20,480 --> 00:00:23,439
my advisor sarah wright meyer and dr

11
00:00:23,439 --> 00:00:24,800
jimmy wilson

12
00:00:24,800 --> 00:00:30,000
and also my undergrad student um isha

13
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:31,920
so for the table of content i'm going to

14
00:00:31,920 --> 00:00:33,440
talk about

15
00:00:33,440 --> 00:00:36,640
um some brief introduction of our paper

16
00:00:36,640 --> 00:00:39,680
and um present three research questions

17
00:00:39,680 --> 00:00:40,719
we have

18
00:00:40,719 --> 00:00:44,079
um came out with for this study and

19
00:00:44,079 --> 00:00:47,280
um dig into the methodology and

20
00:00:47,280 --> 00:00:49,920
statistical analysis of our study and

21
00:00:49,920 --> 00:00:51,920
conclude this presentation with

22
00:00:51,920 --> 00:00:54,960
additional findings

23
00:00:56,079 --> 00:00:58,640
uh so the power introduction privacy

24
00:00:58,640 --> 00:01:00,800
related issues such as

25
00:01:00,800 --> 00:01:03,440
privacy paradox and digital inequalities

26
00:01:03,440 --> 00:01:05,360
still remains as serious

27
00:01:05,360 --> 00:01:08,080
problems just in case you're not really

28
00:01:08,080 --> 00:01:09,680
sure what these two terms

29
00:01:09,680 --> 00:01:13,280
are um privacy paradox refers to users

30
00:01:13,280 --> 00:01:15,600
um

31
00:01:16,720 --> 00:01:19,040
contradicting privacy attitude and their

32
00:01:19,040 --> 00:01:20,799
actual behavior

33
00:01:20,799 --> 00:01:22,560
so for instance if user says they're

34
00:01:22,560 --> 00:01:24,240
worried about their privacy

35
00:01:24,240 --> 00:01:27,040
threats but they actually disclose more

36
00:01:27,040 --> 00:01:28,799
than they usually do

37
00:01:28,799 --> 00:01:32,640
um and this problem can really lead to

38
00:01:32,640 --> 00:01:36,560
uh huge privacy threats to

39
00:01:36,560 --> 00:01:38,320
the users because they're not really

40
00:01:38,320 --> 00:01:40,159
certain what they're doing despite their

41
00:01:40,159 --> 00:01:41,439
worries

42
00:01:41,439 --> 00:01:44,079
and speaking of the digital equality um

43
00:01:44,079 --> 00:01:45,759
it refers to the disparities

44
00:01:45,759 --> 00:01:48,399
in knowledge and ability of using

45
00:01:48,399 --> 00:01:52,479
digital technologies among individuals

46
00:01:52,479 --> 00:01:54,880
so for instance those who have more

47
00:01:54,880 --> 00:01:57,119
resources such as

48
00:01:57,119 --> 00:02:00,079
those who have higher income or higher

49
00:02:00,079 --> 00:02:01,439
education level

50
00:02:01,439 --> 00:02:04,000
tend to have less difficulties in

51
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:06,159
managing their privacy settings

52
00:02:06,159 --> 00:02:09,440
meanwhile those who belong to low scs

53
00:02:09,440 --> 00:02:12,800
um users um have trouble

54
00:02:12,800 --> 00:02:14,800
understanding what the privacy settings

55
00:02:14,800 --> 00:02:17,520
are to adequately protect their personal

56
00:02:17,520 --> 00:02:18,560
information

57
00:02:18,560 --> 00:02:21,040
even if they are aware of the potential

58
00:02:21,040 --> 00:02:22,239
privacy threats

59
00:02:22,239 --> 00:02:24,480
and this has been highlighted in the

60
00:02:24,480 --> 00:02:26,640
previous literature that has inspired us

61
00:02:26,640 --> 00:02:27,840
to look into

62
00:02:27,840 --> 00:02:30,959
this kind of problems um not

63
00:02:30,959 --> 00:02:32,480
surprisingly groups of people from

64
00:02:32,480 --> 00:02:33,920
different cultural and religious

65
00:02:33,920 --> 00:02:34,879
backgrounds possess

66
00:02:34,879 --> 00:02:37,040
unique privacy habits beliefs or

67
00:02:37,040 --> 00:02:38,000
concerns

68
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:40,239
but we believe is very critical to

69
00:02:40,239 --> 00:02:41,599
bridge

70
00:02:41,599 --> 00:02:45,120
that differences that gap that kind of

71
00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:45,840
block

72
00:02:45,840 --> 00:02:48,959
some other users from protecting

73
00:02:48,959 --> 00:02:51,760
themselves from the petition privacy

74
00:02:51,760 --> 00:02:54,160
harms

75
00:02:57,120 --> 00:02:59,360
um hence we proposed three different

76
00:02:59,360 --> 00:03:01,280
research questions

77
00:03:01,280 --> 00:03:03,280
to identify the relationship between

78
00:03:03,280 --> 00:03:05,440
social demographic factors of twitter

79
00:03:05,440 --> 00:03:08,480
users and their online privacy behaviors

80
00:03:08,480 --> 00:03:11,120
so the first research question is about

81
00:03:11,120 --> 00:03:14,159
do demographics and ses has an impact on

82
00:03:14,159 --> 00:03:15,519
the usage of log

83
00:03:15,519 --> 00:03:18,319
and verification and the second research

84
00:03:18,319 --> 00:03:19,360
question is

85
00:03:19,360 --> 00:03:22,239
whether do demographic in ses has an

86
00:03:22,239 --> 00:03:23,280
impact on

87
00:03:23,280 --> 00:03:26,640
the user self-disclosing behaviors and

88
00:03:26,640 --> 00:03:28,480
last but not least do users

89
00:03:28,480 --> 00:03:30,720
self-disclosure topics vary across

90
00:03:30,720 --> 00:03:34,239
demographics and ses

91
00:03:37,760 --> 00:03:39,360
so now we're going to talk about the

92
00:03:39,360 --> 00:03:41,760
methodology of our study

93
00:03:41,760 --> 00:03:45,200
um to start with the methodology we had

94
00:03:45,200 --> 00:03:46,000
to recruit

95
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:48,319
our study participants via twitter ad

96
00:03:48,319 --> 00:03:49,840
targeting services

97
00:03:49,840 --> 00:03:53,040
um twitter at target services is very

98
00:03:53,040 --> 00:03:53,840
useful

99
00:03:53,840 --> 00:03:56,400
if you want to target specific groups of

100
00:03:56,400 --> 00:03:57,760
audiences for your

101
00:03:57,760 --> 00:04:01,519
tweet um advertisement

102
00:04:01,519 --> 00:04:03,120
so they have different settings for

103
00:04:03,120 --> 00:04:05,040
instance like raising their awareness or

104
00:04:05,040 --> 00:04:05,360
or

105
00:04:05,360 --> 00:04:08,959
like raising the uh engagement

106
00:04:08,959 --> 00:04:11,040
to your tweets for instance like

107
00:04:11,040 --> 00:04:12,400
clicking the link that

108
00:04:12,400 --> 00:04:14,799
has been included in your post or click

109
00:04:14,799 --> 00:04:16,798
the image that is included in the post

110
00:04:16,798 --> 00:04:21,918
so you can choose based on your needs um

111
00:04:21,918 --> 00:04:25,280
yeah so using that feature we

112
00:04:25,280 --> 00:04:29,440
collected um your twitter handles

113
00:04:29,440 --> 00:04:30,960
um in addition to demographic

114
00:04:30,960 --> 00:04:32,880
information including gender

115
00:04:32,880 --> 00:04:34,800
age race and ethnicity location

116
00:04:34,800 --> 00:04:36,800
education level and income

117
00:04:36,800 --> 00:04:39,520
information via the first part of our

118
00:04:39,520 --> 00:04:40,080
survey

119
00:04:40,080 --> 00:04:44,320
which was included in the example of

120
00:04:44,320 --> 00:04:48,160
our post in the right hand side

121
00:04:48,160 --> 00:04:51,639
um among 1200 participants

122
00:04:51,639 --> 00:04:55,040
125 users were determined to be eligible

123
00:04:55,040 --> 00:04:56,240
to move forward

124
00:04:56,240 --> 00:04:59,280
given our hidden criteria

125
00:04:59,280 --> 00:05:01,600
um speaking of the hidden criteria the

126
00:05:01,600 --> 00:05:03,120
reason we impose

127
00:05:03,120 --> 00:05:06,639
these criteria is to make sure the users

128
00:05:06,639 --> 00:05:09,759
that are participating in our survey is

129
00:05:09,759 --> 00:05:12,960
actually an active twitter users who

130
00:05:12,960 --> 00:05:14,560
could represent

131
00:05:14,560 --> 00:05:18,240
um the overpopulation of twitter

132
00:05:18,240 --> 00:05:21,440
uh for instance those people who didn't

133
00:05:21,440 --> 00:05:23,759
have their account for more than

134
00:05:23,759 --> 00:05:27,280
one month or who didn't post tweets

135
00:05:27,280 --> 00:05:31,280
um at least like 10 tweets in the last

136
00:05:31,280 --> 00:05:34,800
month were excluding our survey because

137
00:05:34,800 --> 00:05:38,080
we decided um those people are not

138
00:05:38,080 --> 00:05:39,680
eligible to represent

139
00:05:39,680 --> 00:05:43,039
on the active tutor users um

140
00:05:43,039 --> 00:05:47,440
therefore 110 um users have completed

141
00:05:47,440 --> 00:05:48,240
all surveys

142
00:05:48,240 --> 00:05:51,840
with valid twitter handles who met

143
00:05:51,840 --> 00:05:55,198
the hidden criteria as well

144
00:05:56,880 --> 00:05:58,720
secondly we have to distribute our

145
00:05:58,720 --> 00:06:00,800
surveys other parts of the surveys to

146
00:06:00,800 --> 00:06:02,319
include more information

147
00:06:02,319 --> 00:06:05,600
about the authors um so for the entry

148
00:06:05,600 --> 00:06:06,000
survey

149
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:08,800
we mainly asked about their occupation

150
00:06:08,800 --> 00:06:10,160
information

151
00:06:10,160 --> 00:06:13,360
uh because this is we considered this

152
00:06:13,360 --> 00:06:14,880
information could be the key to

153
00:06:14,880 --> 00:06:16,919
determine on the

154
00:06:16,919 --> 00:06:19,759
socioeconomic status of the users apart

155
00:06:19,759 --> 00:06:20,000
from

156
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:22,800
the income level um so we decided to

157
00:06:22,800 --> 00:06:24,880
separate those questions into the entry

158
00:06:24,880 --> 00:06:25,680
survey

159
00:06:25,680 --> 00:06:27,440
and as a part of the exit survey we

160
00:06:27,440 --> 00:06:29,199
wanted to see what kind of posts they

161
00:06:29,199 --> 00:06:31,919
have deleted during the study period

162
00:06:31,919 --> 00:06:33,759
and whether if they use log in

163
00:06:33,759 --> 00:06:35,199
verification setting

164
00:06:35,199 --> 00:06:37,759
which is more related to two-way

165
00:06:37,759 --> 00:06:39,120
authentication

166
00:06:39,120 --> 00:06:42,479
um settings um they're normally known in

167
00:06:42,479 --> 00:06:45,520
other websites and

168
00:06:45,520 --> 00:06:47,440
also we asked if they recall sharing any

169
00:06:47,440 --> 00:06:48,639
of the followings

170
00:06:48,639 --> 00:06:51,360
such as the personal information types

171
00:06:51,360 --> 00:06:52,479
to compare

172
00:06:52,479 --> 00:06:53,919
their recollection and their actual

173
00:06:53,919 --> 00:06:57,919
behaviors in the later part of the study

174
00:06:58,639 --> 00:07:00,639
at the same time we decided to collect

175
00:07:00,639 --> 00:07:02,400
their real-time tweets

176
00:07:02,400 --> 00:07:05,039
so that we could look into what they're

177
00:07:05,039 --> 00:07:05,599
actually

178
00:07:05,599 --> 00:07:08,639
posting apart from their self-reported

179
00:07:08,639 --> 00:07:12,160
um answers so participants real-time

180
00:07:12,160 --> 00:07:13,199
tweets were collected

181
00:07:13,199 --> 00:07:16,319
at a single time point exactly one month

182
00:07:16,319 --> 00:07:18,880
after the entry survey completion and

183
00:07:18,880 --> 00:07:20,080
metadata

184
00:07:20,080 --> 00:07:23,039
for each tweet um including um profile

185
00:07:23,039 --> 00:07:24,479
description hashtags

186
00:07:24,479 --> 00:07:25,919
favorite counts and retweet accounts

187
00:07:25,919 --> 00:07:27,520
were also collected

188
00:07:27,520 --> 00:07:30,800
in total we had 21.68 public

189
00:07:30,800 --> 00:07:34,000
tweets um but we narrowed down to

190
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:38,240
15 727 tweets for our analysis

191
00:07:38,240 --> 00:07:40,240
because these were actually posted by

192
00:07:40,240 --> 00:07:41,360
the users

193
00:07:41,360 --> 00:07:45,840
as they were non-retweets

194
00:07:46,960 --> 00:07:49,280
um last but not least we wanted to make

195
00:07:49,280 --> 00:07:50,800
sure what kind of content they were

196
00:07:50,800 --> 00:07:51,680
sharing

197
00:07:51,680 --> 00:07:54,160
in their post so we manually and

198
00:07:54,160 --> 00:07:55,440
annotated

199
00:07:55,440 --> 00:07:57,520
um the person information types for each

200
00:07:57,520 --> 00:07:58,560
post

201
00:07:58,560 --> 00:08:01,840
so as i have mentioned earlier we have

202
00:08:01,840 --> 00:08:02,479
more than

203
00:08:02,479 --> 00:08:06,080
15 000 posts and for us it is impossible

204
00:08:06,080 --> 00:08:06,639
to

205
00:08:06,639 --> 00:08:08,560
label all of them without getting the

206
00:08:08,560 --> 00:08:10,160
help from like

207
00:08:10,160 --> 00:08:13,599
like the automated detection method um

208
00:08:13,599 --> 00:08:16,160
hence we just narrow it down to those

209
00:08:16,160 --> 00:08:16,879
posts

210
00:08:16,879 --> 00:08:19,680
that are original uh which is equivalent

211
00:08:19,680 --> 00:08:21,120
to non-retweets

212
00:08:21,120 --> 00:08:23,120
and those tweets that contain the first

213
00:08:23,120 --> 00:08:24,400
person pronouns such as

214
00:08:24,400 --> 00:08:28,000
i might need mine um

215
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:31,039
us hours and so forth um

216
00:08:31,039 --> 00:08:34,559
which narrated down to like 6962 tweets

217
00:08:34,559 --> 00:08:35,760
in total

218
00:08:35,760 --> 00:08:37,599
and we manually label them by going

219
00:08:37,599 --> 00:08:39,440
through each post

220
00:08:39,440 --> 00:08:42,719
deliberately if one post contain more

221
00:08:42,719 --> 00:08:44,080
than one of the information

222
00:08:44,080 --> 00:08:48,320
we consider that as a multi-label so

223
00:08:48,320 --> 00:08:51,360
we just check all of the followings and

224
00:08:51,360 --> 00:08:52,640
those three that contain

225
00:08:52,640 --> 00:08:55,040
any of the any of the categories were

226
00:08:55,040 --> 00:08:56,240
labeled as

227
00:08:56,240 --> 00:08:59,360
the post with no self-disclosing

228
00:08:59,360 --> 00:09:02,000
information

229
00:09:03,680 --> 00:09:06,800
as a part of the statistical analysis to

230
00:09:06,800 --> 00:09:07,279
answer

231
00:09:07,279 --> 00:09:10,880
the research questions we had

232
00:09:10,880 --> 00:09:12,800
um several independent variables

233
00:09:12,800 --> 00:09:13,920
including income

234
00:09:13,920 --> 00:09:16,640
gender age education level recent

235
00:09:16,640 --> 00:09:18,320
ethnicity and occupation

236
00:09:18,320 --> 00:09:20,480
which were closely related to the user

237
00:09:20,480 --> 00:09:22,480
social demographic information

238
00:09:22,480 --> 00:09:25,040
and for the dependent variables um all

239
00:09:25,040 --> 00:09:26,880
of them differ based on the research

240
00:09:26,880 --> 00:09:27,760
question

241
00:09:27,760 --> 00:09:30,320
and for the first research question the

242
00:09:30,320 --> 00:09:32,160
use of login verification setting

243
00:09:32,160 --> 00:09:34,240
which could be answered either yes no or

244
00:09:34,240 --> 00:09:36,240
i don't know were collected

245
00:09:36,240 --> 00:09:39,279
from on the survey and for the research

246
00:09:39,279 --> 00:09:40,480
question two

247
00:09:40,480 --> 00:09:44,320
we meant uh we calculated and quantified

248
00:09:44,320 --> 00:09:46,399
the amount of self-disclosure

249
00:09:46,399 --> 00:09:48,959
for each user by calculating the average

250
00:09:48,959 --> 00:09:51,519
percentage of self-disclosing tweets for

251
00:09:51,519 --> 00:09:52,880
each user

252
00:09:52,880 --> 00:09:56,240
um based on the collected tweets and

253
00:09:56,240 --> 00:09:58,240
lastly for the research question three

254
00:09:58,240 --> 00:09:59,760
is pretty similar to the

255
00:09:59,760 --> 00:10:02,000
uh research question tale but we did it

256
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:03,040
for each

257
00:10:03,040 --> 00:10:05,600
person information category and ran on

258
00:10:05,600 --> 00:10:10,000
statistical analysis for each category

259
00:10:12,079 --> 00:10:15,120
um yeah so now i'm going to talk about

260
00:10:15,120 --> 00:10:16,240
the results of our

261
00:10:16,240 --> 00:10:19,040
analysis so for the research question

262
00:10:19,040 --> 00:10:20,399
one we performed

263
00:10:20,399 --> 00:10:22,240
a chi-square test and logistic

264
00:10:22,240 --> 00:10:24,560
regression and results indicated that

265
00:10:24,560 --> 00:10:25,440
none of the sub

266
00:10:25,440 --> 00:10:27,519
none of the social demographic variable

267
00:10:27,519 --> 00:10:29,360
was associated with the use of login

268
00:10:29,360 --> 00:10:30,320
verification

269
00:10:30,320 --> 00:10:32,000
setting which was pretty interesting

270
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:34,079
because pretty previous findings have

271
00:10:34,079 --> 00:10:35,440
mentioned that

272
00:10:35,440 --> 00:10:38,560
um gender or age um

273
00:10:38,560 --> 00:10:42,000
differences were witnessed but in our

274
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:44,000
case we did not witness any of those

275
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:46,240
differences however for the research

276
00:10:46,240 --> 00:10:47,839
question 2 we perform

277
00:10:47,839 --> 00:10:50,240
linear regression model we found that

278
00:10:50,240 --> 00:10:51,920
gender and education

279
00:10:51,920 --> 00:10:54,640
variables were identified as

280
00:10:54,640 --> 00:10:57,200
statistically significant predictors

281
00:10:57,200 --> 00:11:00,399
meaning participants who are men or less

282
00:11:00,399 --> 00:11:01,200
associated with

283
00:11:01,200 --> 00:11:04,720
online self-disclosure by 11.5 percent

284
00:11:04,720 --> 00:11:06,399
than female participants

285
00:11:06,399 --> 00:11:09,120
and those who are in a college diploma

286
00:11:09,120 --> 00:11:09,519
were

287
00:11:09,519 --> 00:11:12,880
14.4 percent less likely to share

288
00:11:12,880 --> 00:11:14,800
their personal information online

289
00:11:14,800 --> 00:11:16,399
compared to those

290
00:11:16,399 --> 00:11:19,600
with less than high school diploma or

291
00:11:19,600 --> 00:11:21,440
equivalent

292
00:11:21,440 --> 00:11:24,160
the overall findings suggested that

293
00:11:24,160 --> 00:11:26,560
those who belong to

294
00:11:26,560 --> 00:11:29,040
low social demographic groups tend to

295
00:11:29,040 --> 00:11:30,399
disclose more

296
00:11:30,399 --> 00:11:34,240
however it cannot be just

297
00:11:34,240 --> 00:11:36,399
uh guaranteed for all of the other

298
00:11:36,399 --> 00:11:37,519
social demographic

299
00:11:37,519 --> 00:11:39,760
variables we only found the differences

300
00:11:39,760 --> 00:11:43,839
in gender and education level

301
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:46,880
and for research question three we ran

302
00:11:46,880 --> 00:11:49,040
on different types of one-way anova for

303
00:11:49,040 --> 00:11:49,920
each personal

304
00:11:49,920 --> 00:11:53,519
information category and we found that

305
00:11:53,519 --> 00:11:56,160
self-disclosing behavior to birthday and

306
00:11:56,160 --> 00:11:57,200
age or

307
00:11:57,200 --> 00:12:00,800
education and opinion categories differ

308
00:12:00,800 --> 00:12:02,560
within the gender groups

309
00:12:02,560 --> 00:12:05,440
if you want to check out how different

310
00:12:05,440 --> 00:12:07,920
they are you could go back to the paper

311
00:12:07,920 --> 00:12:10,000
um we're gonna have more detail in the

312
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:11,680
paper but due to time limitation i

313
00:12:11,680 --> 00:12:13,519
didn't include it in the slide

314
00:12:13,519 --> 00:12:15,040
um and for the second finding

315
00:12:15,040 --> 00:12:17,360
disclosures of birthday and age

316
00:12:17,360 --> 00:12:19,920
were um significantly correlated with

317
00:12:19,920 --> 00:12:21,760
the level of education

318
00:12:21,760 --> 00:12:23,920
and for the third finding in terms of

319
00:12:23,920 --> 00:12:25,120
ethnic group

320
00:12:25,120 --> 00:12:27,200
um disclosure of gender information

321
00:12:27,200 --> 00:12:28,800
differs significantly

322
00:12:28,800 --> 00:12:31,600
and for the last findings um differences

323
00:12:31,600 --> 00:12:32,720
in rates

324
00:12:32,720 --> 00:12:35,120
and ethnicity gender and location

325
00:12:35,120 --> 00:12:37,600
categories within different occupations

326
00:12:37,600 --> 00:12:41,519
were um significant as well

327
00:12:41,519 --> 00:12:43,440
again if you have more questions about

328
00:12:43,440 --> 00:12:44,880
this um

329
00:12:44,880 --> 00:12:47,279
detailed um description of this research

330
00:12:47,279 --> 00:12:48,079
question

331
00:12:48,079 --> 00:12:50,839
um you can visit me in the poster

332
00:12:50,839 --> 00:12:53,360
section

333
00:12:53,360 --> 00:12:55,519
and our additional findings were pretty

334
00:12:55,519 --> 00:12:56,399
interesting too

335
00:12:56,399 --> 00:12:58,959
because this was something different

336
00:12:58,959 --> 00:13:00,720
from our research questions

337
00:13:00,720 --> 00:13:03,760
and this findings have illustrated that

338
00:13:03,760 --> 00:13:06,959
people actually didn't

339
00:13:06,959 --> 00:13:08,399
share that much compared to their

340
00:13:08,399 --> 00:13:10,000
recollection

341
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:12,079
so as you can see for specific

342
00:13:12,079 --> 00:13:14,399
categories such as recent density

343
00:13:14,399 --> 00:13:17,200
and state information city information

344
00:13:17,200 --> 00:13:19,200
hobbies tv programs and leisure

345
00:13:19,200 --> 00:13:20,720
activities

346
00:13:20,720 --> 00:13:22,399
we found that people actually thought

347
00:13:22,399 --> 00:13:24,240
they have disclosed more

348
00:13:24,240 --> 00:13:26,880
but they didn't really disclose um in

349
00:13:26,880 --> 00:13:27,760
their tweets

350
00:13:27,760 --> 00:13:30,959
which was very interesting this

351
00:13:30,959 --> 00:13:32,800
sort of highlights that people don't

352
00:13:32,800 --> 00:13:34,000
really remember what they're

353
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:37,040
sharing online uh which can lead to a

354
00:13:37,040 --> 00:13:38,800
really serious privacy threat in the

355
00:13:38,800 --> 00:13:39,839
future

356
00:13:39,839 --> 00:13:42,800
um maybe this findings related to one of

357
00:13:42,800 --> 00:13:44,160
our limitations that

358
00:13:44,160 --> 00:13:46,800
we only annotated those tweets with

359
00:13:46,800 --> 00:13:49,120
first person pronouns so

360
00:13:49,120 --> 00:13:52,320
yeah this result can be misleading but

361
00:13:52,320 --> 00:13:54,160
as you can see we could witness like the

362
00:13:54,160 --> 00:13:56,240
hugest um disparities

363
00:13:56,240 --> 00:13:57,680
based on their recollection and their

364
00:13:57,680 --> 00:14:00,480
actual behaviors which also highlight

365
00:14:00,480 --> 00:14:02,880
um people have trouble remembering what

366
00:14:02,880 --> 00:14:05,439
they're sharing

367
00:14:05,920 --> 00:14:07,760
and then we also compare the privacy

368
00:14:07,760 --> 00:14:09,279
behavior and

369
00:14:09,279 --> 00:14:11,680
um their privacy concerns on the

370
00:14:11,680 --> 00:14:13,279
self-reported use of login and

371
00:14:13,279 --> 00:14:18,000
verification settings among our study um

372
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:22,560
highlighted that more than 57

373
00:14:22,560 --> 00:14:25,199
of people have answered no or i don't

374
00:14:25,199 --> 00:14:26,320
know

375
00:14:26,320 --> 00:14:29,360
which is also very interesting

376
00:14:29,360 --> 00:14:32,720
um yeah so even if

377
00:14:32,720 --> 00:14:34,560
majority of people said they are worried

378
00:14:34,560 --> 00:14:36,560
about um

379
00:14:36,560 --> 00:14:39,120
their account security they don't really

380
00:14:39,120 --> 00:14:40,560
know what kind of setting they were

381
00:14:40,560 --> 00:14:42,000
using in fact

382
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:43,839
because a lot of people have said

383
00:14:43,839 --> 00:14:45,199
they're not using it and they don't

384
00:14:45,199 --> 00:14:47,279
really know whether if they're using it

385
00:14:47,279 --> 00:14:50,480
um so maybe alarming them about their

386
00:14:50,480 --> 00:14:53,760
settings could be very beneficial um in

387
00:14:53,760 --> 00:14:56,800
the future work um we also

388
00:14:56,800 --> 00:14:58,639
found no correlation between your

389
00:14:58,639 --> 00:15:00,399
self-disclosure and the use

390
00:15:00,399 --> 00:15:03,440
of vlogging variation options which sort

391
00:15:03,440 --> 00:15:04,000
of

392
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:07,040
highlight um

393
00:15:07,120 --> 00:15:08,380
highlight um

394
00:15:08,380 --> 00:15:10,240
[Music]

395
00:15:10,240 --> 00:15:13,920
the privacy um divide that i have

396
00:15:13,920 --> 00:15:17,519
um demonstrated in the first part of the

397
00:15:17,519 --> 00:15:20,160
presentation

398
00:15:20,320 --> 00:15:22,639
so as a part of the conclusion uh we

399
00:15:22,639 --> 00:15:24,160
want to point out that on the contrary

400
00:15:24,160 --> 00:15:26,000
to our expected results

401
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:29,199
their logging vacation usage does not

402
00:15:29,199 --> 00:15:30,560
differ

403
00:15:30,560 --> 00:15:32,720
and not all social demographic

404
00:15:32,720 --> 00:15:33,920
predictors

405
00:15:33,920 --> 00:15:36,399
contribute to um differences in

406
00:15:36,399 --> 00:15:38,079
self-disclosing behaviors

407
00:15:38,079 --> 00:15:41,360
only gender and education level did um

408
00:15:41,360 --> 00:15:42,079
and also

409
00:15:42,079 --> 00:15:44,639
topics of discussion very notably among

410
00:15:44,639 --> 00:15:46,720
social demographic groups

411
00:15:46,720 --> 00:15:50,000
um and also as a part of the interesting

412
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:52,079
findings um

413
00:15:52,079 --> 00:15:53,759
participants recollection of sharing

414
00:15:53,759 --> 00:15:55,759
does not match their actual

415
00:15:55,759 --> 00:15:59,040
behaviors which really signals a huge

416
00:15:59,040 --> 00:16:02,240
uh privacy harms and

417
00:16:02,240 --> 00:16:05,440
um based on our analysis we've

418
00:16:05,440 --> 00:16:07,920
found that there's need for future work

419
00:16:07,920 --> 00:16:10,079
that's just users with keeping track of

420
00:16:10,079 --> 00:16:11,440
what kind of information they are

421
00:16:11,440 --> 00:16:13,759
sharing online and what kind of privacy

422
00:16:13,759 --> 00:16:16,000
settings they have as their default

423
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:17,920
because a lot of people have answered

424
00:16:17,920 --> 00:16:19,120
don't really know what kind of things

425
00:16:19,120 --> 00:16:20,079
they're using

426
00:16:20,079 --> 00:16:22,000
and we also witnessed a huge

427
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:23,600
discrepancies of their

428
00:16:23,600 --> 00:16:27,440
recollection and their active behaviors

429
00:16:28,320 --> 00:16:30,959
so this is all for the presentation um

430
00:16:30,959 --> 00:16:32,480
thank you for listening if you want to
