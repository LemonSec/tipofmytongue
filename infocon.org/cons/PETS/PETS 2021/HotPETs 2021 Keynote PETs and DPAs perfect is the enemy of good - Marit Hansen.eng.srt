00:00:32,079 --> 00:00:33,120
technologies

18
00:00:33,120 --> 00:00:36,559
um and is a real beacon of expertise

19
00:00:36,559 --> 00:00:37,360
within the

20
00:00:37,360 --> 00:00:39,120
the german data protection system and

21
00:00:39,120 --> 00:00:40,559
data protection uh

22
00:00:40,559 --> 00:00:43,760
more broadly so uh in hot pets we try to

23
00:00:43,760 --> 00:00:44,000
get

24
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:45,760
lots of different voices from different

25
00:00:45,760 --> 00:00:47,200
angles to the table and we're really

26
00:00:47,200 --> 00:00:48,960
pleased that maurice is able to join us

27
00:00:48,960 --> 00:00:49,600
to talk

28
00:00:49,600 --> 00:00:52,559
about pets and dpas perfect is the enemy

29
00:00:52,559 --> 00:00:54,160
of the good

30
00:00:54,160 --> 00:00:56,160
over to you married thank you very much

31
00:00:56,160 --> 00:00:58,719
michael very pleased to be invited of

32
00:00:58,719 --> 00:00:59,840
course also very

33
00:00:59,840 --> 00:01:02,480
nice introduction of my person and

34
00:01:02,480 --> 00:01:03,120
perhaps

35
00:01:03,120 --> 00:01:06,080
one one more important uh background

36
00:01:06,080 --> 00:01:08,159
information i'm computer scientist by

37
00:01:08,159 --> 00:01:11,040
my training but i have to work in this

38
00:01:11,040 --> 00:01:11,520
very

39
00:01:11,520 --> 00:01:14,880
legally influenced part and you will see

40
00:01:14,880 --> 00:01:16,640
what this is about and perhaps why

41
00:01:16,640 --> 00:01:18,000
sometimes there are their

42
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:19,520
misunderstandings or

43
00:01:19,520 --> 00:01:22,960
how we can can perhaps improve

44
00:01:22,960 --> 00:01:25,200
the dpas the pet community the

45
00:01:25,200 --> 00:01:26,560
collaboration

46
00:01:26,560 --> 00:01:29,439
in a way where we really strive for the

47
00:01:29,439 --> 00:01:30,000
better

48
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:33,360
and so i i

49
00:01:33,360 --> 00:01:35,840
think perfect is the enemy of good this

50
00:01:35,840 --> 00:01:36,720
is saying

51
00:01:36,720 --> 00:01:40,079
it was well perhaps by voltaire but also

52
00:01:40,079 --> 00:01:43,040
others are always doing that but let's

53
00:01:43,040 --> 00:01:43,920
see how it

54
00:01:43,920 --> 00:01:46,799
goes and if now i have my second slide

55
00:01:46,799 --> 00:01:48,240
here if you don't see it

56
00:01:48,240 --> 00:01:50,560
please fall in but otherwise so this is

57
00:01:50,560 --> 00:01:52,399
the setting of uld we are in the very

58
00:01:52,399 --> 00:01:53,200
north

59
00:01:53,200 --> 00:01:57,360
of germany and this means that

60
00:01:57,360 --> 00:02:00,799
the nice touristic angle with the north

61
00:02:00,799 --> 00:02:04,159
the baltic sea and the north sea at the

62
00:02:04,159 --> 00:02:06,560
the borders here and in the very north

63
00:02:06,560 --> 00:02:07,520
denmark

64
00:02:07,520 --> 00:02:10,720
and this means we are also very very

65
00:02:10,720 --> 00:02:11,920
much interested

66
00:02:11,920 --> 00:02:15,280
in uh cooperation probably because

67
00:02:15,280 --> 00:02:18,720
there were so many people

68
00:02:18,720 --> 00:02:22,480
relying on the sea and

69
00:02:22,480 --> 00:02:26,080
traveling uh and we'll see how this will

70
00:02:26,080 --> 00:02:29,680
work out here in germany it's now uh

71
00:02:29,680 --> 00:02:32,560
quarter past five and it's very hot uh

72
00:02:32,560 --> 00:02:34,080
especially because we are not used in

73
00:02:34,080 --> 00:02:35,840
the north of germany hot

74
00:02:35,840 --> 00:02:39,519
setting and i i'm looking forward to

75
00:02:39,519 --> 00:02:40,000
coming

76
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:43,519
and meeting you in person at some next

77
00:02:43,519 --> 00:02:45,519
uh events if it's possible again of

78
00:02:45,519 --> 00:02:47,280
course okay what am i

79
00:02:47,280 --> 00:02:49,040
talking about perfect is the enemy of

80
00:02:49,040 --> 00:02:50,480
good and

81
00:02:50,480 --> 00:02:53,120
i only learned recently that very many

82
00:02:53,120 --> 00:02:53,599
people

83
00:02:53,599 --> 00:02:56,640
interpret this saying in a different

84
00:02:56,640 --> 00:03:00,480
way so something something

85
00:03:00,480 --> 00:03:03,120
perfect is the enemy of good means let's

86
00:03:03,120 --> 00:03:05,040
strive for the perfect let's drive

87
00:03:05,040 --> 00:03:07,519
for the better because if we only have

88
00:03:07,519 --> 00:03:09,120
something which is okay

89
00:03:09,120 --> 00:03:11,440
perhaps this is not not good enough

90
00:03:11,440 --> 00:03:13,040
let's let's go for the perfect

91
00:03:13,040 --> 00:03:15,599
solution but then more and more it's

92
00:03:15,599 --> 00:03:17,519
being discussed at a bad thing that

93
00:03:17,519 --> 00:03:19,360
perfect is a bad thing because

94
00:03:19,360 --> 00:03:21,920
they are rarely achievable any anyhow

95
00:03:21,920 --> 00:03:22,800
and

96
00:03:22,800 --> 00:03:25,360
then you may stop already when it's

97
00:03:25,360 --> 00:03:26,319
sufficiently

98
00:03:26,319 --> 00:03:30,080
okay and what what is it

99
00:03:30,080 --> 00:03:32,080
what we are now discussing here with

100
00:03:32,080 --> 00:03:33,599
data protection

101
00:03:33,599 --> 00:03:36,799
and um well we will see uh after after

102
00:03:36,799 --> 00:03:37,200
my

103
00:03:37,200 --> 00:03:39,680
last slide uh whether you think it's

104
00:03:39,680 --> 00:03:40,239
more a

105
00:03:40,239 --> 00:03:42,799
or more b or we can combine it in some

106
00:03:42,799 --> 00:03:43,599
way

107
00:03:43,599 --> 00:03:46,239
um my overview is i want to tell you a

108
00:03:46,239 --> 00:03:47,680
little bit about data protection you

109
00:03:47,680 --> 00:03:49,680
know that already of course

110
00:03:49,680 --> 00:03:52,239
the gdpr the general data protection

111
00:03:52,239 --> 00:03:53,760
regulation which is

112
00:03:53,760 --> 00:03:57,360
our very big guidance

113
00:03:57,360 --> 00:04:01,519
very big legal reform

114
00:04:01,519 --> 00:04:05,920
result from 2016. it's available

115
00:04:05,920 --> 00:04:09,120
from 2018 now and

116
00:04:09,120 --> 00:04:12,159
i i don't think it's a success story yet

117
00:04:12,159 --> 00:04:12,799
but still

118
00:04:12,799 --> 00:04:15,120
it has some influence even outside

119
00:04:15,120 --> 00:04:16,959
europe and therefore it makes sense

120
00:04:16,959 --> 00:04:20,079
to have a look um i also want to

121
00:04:20,079 --> 00:04:21,680
point out and this is even not well

122
00:04:21,680 --> 00:04:23,440
known in germany and even not well known

123
00:04:23,440 --> 00:04:25,600
by citizens or lawyers

124
00:04:25,600 --> 00:04:29,040
how dpas are doing their daily work how

125
00:04:29,040 --> 00:04:32,000
they at least have to work perhaps they

126
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:32,720
don't work

127
00:04:32,720 --> 00:04:35,199
always in that way but this explains a

128
00:04:35,199 --> 00:04:36,240
bit how

129
00:04:36,240 --> 00:04:39,600
how it's um what what is not not working

130
00:04:39,600 --> 00:04:42,960
so well yet or how we can improve

131
00:04:42,960 --> 00:04:45,919
the perhaps also collaboration then data

132
00:04:45,919 --> 00:04:48,160
protection by design and by default is

133
00:04:48,160 --> 00:04:50,000
kind of a privacy by design and by

134
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:51,440
default i want to

135
00:04:51,440 --> 00:04:53,280
have a look together with you in one of

136
00:04:53,280 --> 00:04:55,440
the articles of the gdpr

137
00:04:55,440 --> 00:04:57,759
and then let's discuss together how to

138
00:04:57,759 --> 00:04:59,040
bring heads

139
00:04:59,040 --> 00:05:02,639
into a reality so um

140
00:05:02,639 --> 00:05:06,240
data protection is is more than

141
00:05:06,240 --> 00:05:08,639
only protecting your own data it's not

142
00:05:08,639 --> 00:05:10,560
about owning your data it's

143
00:05:10,560 --> 00:05:13,199
something which has been well motivated

144
00:05:13,199 --> 00:05:14,560
by an imbalance

145
00:05:14,560 --> 00:05:17,840
in power meaning that there are

146
00:05:17,840 --> 00:05:22,160
many companies also states

147
00:05:22,160 --> 00:05:25,280
processing data about persons personal

148
00:05:25,280 --> 00:05:26,080
data

149
00:05:26,080 --> 00:05:29,120
uh in a way that it's not known by

150
00:05:29,120 --> 00:05:30,800
people not transparent by them

151
00:05:30,800 --> 00:05:34,240
and they really well see that

152
00:05:34,240 --> 00:05:36,639
those who who own data or who can work

153
00:05:36,639 --> 00:05:38,560
with data they

154
00:05:38,560 --> 00:05:40,880
they also have some power and there's

155
00:05:40,880 --> 00:05:41,919
power imbalance

156
00:05:41,919 --> 00:05:45,360
this is motivating the main legal basic

157
00:05:45,360 --> 00:05:46,160
rights

158
00:05:46,160 --> 00:05:49,360
and for data protection but also

159
00:05:49,360 --> 00:05:51,520
that it's not only about of course

160
00:05:51,520 --> 00:05:53,280
looking at the organizations

161
00:05:53,280 --> 00:05:55,440
but taking the perspective of the

162
00:05:55,440 --> 00:05:56,639
individuals

163
00:05:56,639 --> 00:05:58,960
and um some people think with security

164
00:05:58,960 --> 00:06:00,479
everything is already explained

165
00:06:00,479 --> 00:06:01,919
obviously it's not

166
00:06:01,919 --> 00:06:05,039
uh so here we try to look

167
00:06:05,039 --> 00:06:07,360
at the perspective of the individuals

168
00:06:07,360 --> 00:06:08,720
and the risks

169
00:06:08,720 --> 00:06:11,680
and it's about the risks to the rights

170
00:06:11,680 --> 00:06:14,000
and freedoms that are defined and

171
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:18,479
specified in the european basic

172
00:06:18,479 --> 00:06:21,360
laws of the fundamental rights but this

173
00:06:21,360 --> 00:06:21,680
is

174
00:06:21,680 --> 00:06:24,639
i think something which in theory is uh

175
00:06:24,639 --> 00:06:25,520
quite agreed

176
00:06:25,520 --> 00:06:28,880
upon on throughout the world

177
00:06:28,880 --> 00:06:31,199
in practice um well it does not work

178
00:06:31,199 --> 00:06:32,880
that well

179
00:06:32,880 --> 00:06:35,360
the general data protection regulation

180
00:06:35,360 --> 00:06:36,080
um was

181
00:06:36,080 --> 00:06:39,840
set up in 2016

182
00:06:39,840 --> 00:06:43,120
as the successor of the general data

183
00:06:43,120 --> 00:06:44,240
protection on offline

184
00:06:44,240 --> 00:06:47,919
data protection directive a directive in

185
00:06:47,919 --> 00:06:49,759
european law means that

186
00:06:49,759 --> 00:06:53,599
each of the member states of the 27

187
00:06:53,599 --> 00:06:57,039
member states have to transpose the

188
00:06:57,039 --> 00:06:59,360
directive into their own national law

189
00:06:59,360 --> 00:07:01,280
and the regulation means they

190
00:07:01,280 --> 00:07:03,599
should use or they are the the

191
00:07:03,599 --> 00:07:05,599
regulation applies directly

192
00:07:05,599 --> 00:07:08,319
although we have here now a general

193
00:07:08,319 --> 00:07:09,759
regulation which means

194
00:07:09,759 --> 00:07:12,479
that most of the parts apply directly

195
00:07:12,479 --> 00:07:13,120
and some

196
00:07:13,120 --> 00:07:16,960
can be specified by the member states

197
00:07:16,960 --> 00:07:18,720
and the objective was a real

198
00:07:18,720 --> 00:07:20,800
harmonization a level playing field

199
00:07:20,800 --> 00:07:22,160
something where

200
00:07:22,160 --> 00:07:24,880
the full european union the entire union

201
00:07:24,880 --> 00:07:26,800
agrees on some standards and data

202
00:07:26,800 --> 00:07:27,680
protection

203
00:07:27,680 --> 00:07:29,840
but there are also opening clauses so

204
00:07:29,840 --> 00:07:31,599
specification possibilities

205
00:07:31,599 --> 00:07:34,479
and well it's already more than three

206
00:07:34,479 --> 00:07:36,880
years old

207
00:07:36,880 --> 00:07:40,800
and really lacking some enforcement so

208
00:07:40,800 --> 00:07:41,919
if you

209
00:07:41,919 --> 00:07:44,560
have a look how the big players on the

210
00:07:44,560 --> 00:07:46,000
internet have changed their data

211
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:47,039
processing yes they

212
00:07:47,039 --> 00:07:49,120
they did that but not necessarily

213
00:07:49,120 --> 00:07:50,240
because they

214
00:07:50,240 --> 00:07:52,879
wanted to uh do something in favor of

215
00:07:52,879 --> 00:07:54,000
data protection

216
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:57,120
sometimes it seems that it's

217
00:07:57,120 --> 00:08:00,720
something where they pick up or try to

218
00:08:00,720 --> 00:08:04,080
perhaps even sabotage some of the uh

219
00:08:04,080 --> 00:08:05,840
some of the regulations some of the

220
00:08:05,840 --> 00:08:08,400
requirements and interpret them in the

221
00:08:08,400 --> 00:08:11,599
the own way and right now we are still

222
00:08:11,599 --> 00:08:12,000
lacking

223
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:14,960
some enforcement but perhaps we can come

224
00:08:14,960 --> 00:08:15,759
to that as

225
00:08:15,759 --> 00:08:19,199
well the game changer idea

226
00:08:19,199 --> 00:08:21,919
this was the advertisement very for for

227
00:08:21,919 --> 00:08:22,960
several years

228
00:08:22,960 --> 00:08:26,400
uh i think um it may it may work out

229
00:08:26,400 --> 00:08:29,520
and there are several uh tools that are

230
00:08:29,520 --> 00:08:31,360
some of them are new some have been

231
00:08:31,360 --> 00:08:33,839
existing in national law already

232
00:08:33,839 --> 00:08:37,279
um and some are old concepts that now

233
00:08:37,279 --> 00:08:40,559
should should have some more effect

234
00:08:40,559 --> 00:08:42,080
something which is quite interesting is

235
00:08:42,080 --> 00:08:43,839
the market location principle

236
00:08:43,839 --> 00:08:48,320
this means even those companies

237
00:08:48,320 --> 00:08:51,040
that are not located in the european

238
00:08:51,040 --> 00:08:51,920
union but

239
00:08:51,920 --> 00:08:55,600
work and observe monitor behavior

240
00:08:55,600 --> 00:08:58,399
of citizens in the european union they

241
00:08:58,399 --> 00:08:58,720
are

242
00:08:58,720 --> 00:09:02,320
also bound to the law of the european

243
00:09:02,320 --> 00:09:04,480
uh the general data protection

244
00:09:04,480 --> 00:09:05,760
regulation

245
00:09:05,760 --> 00:09:08,320
because so and even if it's not about

246
00:09:08,320 --> 00:09:09,519
selling goods but

247
00:09:09,519 --> 00:09:11,920
working with data meaning tracking for

248
00:09:11,920 --> 00:09:12,800
example

249
00:09:12,800 --> 00:09:16,080
breaking of people monitoring online

250
00:09:16,080 --> 00:09:18,800
the online world this is something where

251
00:09:18,800 --> 00:09:21,600
it's not necessary to have

252
00:09:21,600 --> 00:09:23,920
the company located in the european

253
00:09:23,920 --> 00:09:26,720
union still the gdpr applies

254
00:09:26,720 --> 00:09:29,120
there's some difficulties with that but

255
00:09:29,120 --> 00:09:31,200
it's something that makes sense

256
00:09:31,200 --> 00:09:34,480
to have a look at if people are

257
00:09:34,480 --> 00:09:37,600
developing solutions for um

258
00:09:37,600 --> 00:09:39,760
but that should be used as well in

259
00:09:39,760 --> 00:09:40,640
europe or

260
00:09:40,640 --> 00:09:42,880
if the european market is being

261
00:09:42,880 --> 00:09:44,160
addressed

262
00:09:44,160 --> 00:09:46,080
um the data protection by design and by

263
00:09:46,080 --> 00:09:47,360
default uh

264
00:09:47,360 --> 00:09:50,240
provisions uh they were new to european

265
00:09:50,240 --> 00:09:51,279
law but

266
00:09:51,279 --> 00:09:53,920
obviously the pet community was aware of

267
00:09:53,920 --> 00:09:55,760
many of those things as well and

268
00:09:55,760 --> 00:09:58,160
i think if you have a look at the

269
00:09:58,160 --> 00:09:59,360
article 25

270
00:09:59,360 --> 00:10:02,480
we will do that together uh it may be

271
00:10:02,480 --> 00:10:03,360
disappointing

272
00:10:03,360 --> 00:10:07,839
it's not what you may expect um

273
00:10:07,839 --> 00:10:10,880
the gdpr has a basic concept of

274
00:10:10,880 --> 00:10:14,320
tackling risks and knowing the risk

275
00:10:14,320 --> 00:10:16,160
doing some impact assessment if there

276
00:10:16,160 --> 00:10:18,880
are high risks and having some some

277
00:10:18,880 --> 00:10:20,560
remedies and sufficient remedies of

278
00:10:20,560 --> 00:10:21,760
course

279
00:10:21,760 --> 00:10:25,040
and therefore this means that high risk

280
00:10:25,040 --> 00:10:26,160
data processing

281
00:10:26,160 --> 00:10:28,880
needs to be better safeguarded there are

282
00:10:28,880 --> 00:10:29,279
more

283
00:10:29,279 --> 00:10:32,399
guarantees necessary and low risk but

284
00:10:32,399 --> 00:10:34,560
where to draw the line how to define

285
00:10:34,560 --> 00:10:35,920
that and there's

286
00:10:35,920 --> 00:10:38,480
obviously something where the debates

287
00:10:38,480 --> 00:10:39,680
are ongoing

288
00:10:39,680 --> 00:10:42,399
um the most thing that got us awareness

289
00:10:42,399 --> 00:10:44,160
for data protection and it has changed

290
00:10:44,160 --> 00:10:46,800
for the last five years was the section

291
00:10:46,800 --> 00:10:47,839
on fines

292
00:10:47,839 --> 00:10:49,839
because they're very high fines some are

293
00:10:49,839 --> 00:10:50,959
so high they are very

294
00:10:50,959 --> 00:10:55,519
well maybe even unrealistic uh to get

295
00:10:55,519 --> 00:10:57,360
this kind of money but it can be

296
00:10:57,360 --> 00:10:59,680
millions of of euros

297
00:10:59,680 --> 00:11:02,079
as a fine um i will show you that the

298
00:11:02,079 --> 00:11:03,200
fines are

299
00:11:03,200 --> 00:11:06,240
not the strongest instrument to do

300
00:11:06,240 --> 00:11:08,000
something but the fines got us the

301
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:09,680
awareness but also

302
00:11:09,680 --> 00:11:14,480
um the way of everybody who doesn't want

303
00:11:14,480 --> 00:11:16,720
to pay a fine or want to

304
00:11:16,720 --> 00:11:19,519
protect their company they are hiring

305
00:11:19,519 --> 00:11:20,640
lawyers and then

306
00:11:20,640 --> 00:11:23,519
uh the next steps will be a proceeding

307
00:11:23,519 --> 00:11:24,320
for court

308
00:11:24,320 --> 00:11:28,560
and this is also something which yeah

309
00:11:28,560 --> 00:11:31,680
where we see that this will well will be

310
00:11:31,680 --> 00:11:32,640
something that

311
00:11:32,640 --> 00:11:36,560
won't change so so uh quickly

312
00:11:36,640 --> 00:11:38,240
there are data protection principles

313
00:11:38,240 --> 00:11:40,399
that they are defined in article five

314
00:11:40,399 --> 00:11:43,519
i only to mention them in a brief way

315
00:11:43,519 --> 00:11:45,440
um if you have worked with them i think

316
00:11:45,440 --> 00:11:46,880
they are quite okay if you

317
00:11:46,880 --> 00:11:49,519
want to understand them in this way um

318
00:11:49,519 --> 00:11:50,639
perhaps it's

319
00:11:50,639 --> 00:11:52,800
it's a little bit difficult with wording

320
00:11:52,800 --> 00:11:54,480
what about the difference between data

321
00:11:54,480 --> 00:11:56,639
minimization and storage limitation

322
00:11:56,639 --> 00:11:57,440
early

323
00:11:57,440 --> 00:11:59,839
also what about the security things

324
00:11:59,839 --> 00:12:01,200
together with accuracy

325
00:12:01,200 --> 00:12:04,959
and but let's skip that a little bit

326
00:12:04,959 --> 00:12:08,880
in principle it's about fairness a fair

327
00:12:08,880 --> 00:12:12,480
data processing and the

328
00:12:12,480 --> 00:12:15,519
principles are well a little bit more

329
00:12:15,519 --> 00:12:17,440
specific of course but they are not that

330
00:12:17,440 --> 00:12:18,480
specific

331
00:12:18,480 --> 00:12:21,920
and as always the principles are hardly

332
00:12:21,920 --> 00:12:22,320
met

333
00:12:22,320 --> 00:12:25,600
to 100 percent in each scenario

334
00:12:25,600 --> 00:12:27,040
often it's not possible because there

335
00:12:27,040 --> 00:12:29,600
are some some dependencies if you

336
00:12:29,600 --> 00:12:30,959
optimize something or

337
00:12:30,959 --> 00:12:34,880
enhance one

338
00:12:35,440 --> 00:12:37,680
principle then the implementation of

339
00:12:37,680 --> 00:12:39,680
others maybe

340
00:12:39,680 --> 00:12:42,079
okay so i i will show you how we are

341
00:12:42,079 --> 00:12:43,279
working and um

342
00:12:43,279 --> 00:12:45,839
first if you have a starting point the

343
00:12:45,839 --> 00:12:46,560
tasks

344
00:12:46,560 --> 00:12:50,320
in article 57 of the gdpr the 99

345
00:12:50,320 --> 00:12:51,519
articles by the way

346
00:12:51,519 --> 00:12:54,959
um there are very very many of

347
00:12:54,959 --> 00:12:58,880
the tasks and in principle is about

348
00:12:58,880 --> 00:13:01,360
monitoring and enforcing the application

349
00:13:01,360 --> 00:13:05,600
of this regulation we um

350
00:13:05,600 --> 00:13:07,839
um they're they're quite interesting

351
00:13:07,839 --> 00:13:09,680
because they're investigative powers

352
00:13:09,680 --> 00:13:10,880
corrective powers

353
00:13:10,880 --> 00:13:12,480
and it's uh also something on

354
00:13:12,480 --> 00:13:14,399
authorization and advisory powers

355
00:13:14,399 --> 00:13:16,880
but let's have a look at the corrective

356
00:13:16,880 --> 00:13:18,320
powers they are the

357
00:13:18,320 --> 00:13:22,000
real powers of a data protection

358
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:24,160
authority and if you want to understand

359
00:13:24,160 --> 00:13:25,200
how this works

360
00:13:25,200 --> 00:13:27,440
usually we are very much driven by a

361
00:13:27,440 --> 00:13:28,320
complaint

362
00:13:28,320 --> 00:13:31,600
the complaint will be

363
00:13:31,600 --> 00:13:34,320
filed by usually by an individual as

364
00:13:34,320 --> 00:13:36,079
saying my data has been

365
00:13:36,079 --> 00:13:39,120
misused or i i haven't gotten

366
00:13:39,120 --> 00:13:42,399
my uh the the full

367
00:13:42,399 --> 00:13:44,959
personal data when i ask that i wanted

368
00:13:44,959 --> 00:13:46,480
access to the personal data

369
00:13:46,480 --> 00:13:49,680
the data has not been deleted

370
00:13:49,680 --> 00:13:52,079
has not been rectified and there are

371
00:13:52,079 --> 00:13:52,800
some of those

372
00:13:52,800 --> 00:13:54,720
complaints or i didn't get sufficient

373
00:13:54,720 --> 00:13:56,000
information

374
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:59,920
um we receive this complaint as the dpa

375
00:13:59,920 --> 00:14:01,839
and then we examine whether this is a

376
00:14:01,839 --> 00:14:04,639
valid complaint or not and very often

377
00:14:04,639 --> 00:14:06,399
principle it's valid there are very very

378
00:14:06,399 --> 00:14:09,040
few uh where we already see that it's

379
00:14:09,040 --> 00:14:11,680
um it doesn't make sense but we also

380
00:14:11,680 --> 00:14:12,399
have to

381
00:14:12,399 --> 00:14:14,480
check whether this is something in our

382
00:14:14,480 --> 00:14:16,480
jurisdiction and you've seen

383
00:14:16,480 --> 00:14:19,600
first of all i'm german so some parts

384
00:14:19,600 --> 00:14:22,800
where the location of the company

385
00:14:22,800 --> 00:14:25,760
is not in germany we have to forward to

386
00:14:25,760 --> 00:14:27,279
the right

387
00:14:27,279 --> 00:14:30,480
member state dpa or if it's something

388
00:14:30,480 --> 00:14:31,199
where

389
00:14:31,199 --> 00:14:34,079
in other land understand the region of

390
00:14:34,079 --> 00:14:35,519
germany

391
00:14:35,519 --> 00:14:37,519
is affected then we have to forward it

392
00:14:37,519 --> 00:14:39,199
to them so the examination of the

393
00:14:39,199 --> 00:14:41,120
complaint means also checking

394
00:14:41,120 --> 00:14:43,440
how many of those are really our

395
00:14:43,440 --> 00:14:44,399
competitors

396
00:14:44,399 --> 00:14:46,800
in our jurisdiction that we can and have

397
00:14:46,800 --> 00:14:47,680
to

398
00:14:47,680 --> 00:14:50,720
work on and which is uh

399
00:14:50,720 --> 00:14:55,120
in the um competence of other

400
00:14:55,120 --> 00:14:58,480
member states or other german dpas

401
00:14:58,480 --> 00:15:00,800
in germany it's extra complicated

402
00:15:00,800 --> 00:15:02,519
because we have also something like

403
00:15:02,519 --> 00:15:04,720
telecommunication which is then

404
00:15:04,720 --> 00:15:07,440
put on the federal level but some parts

405
00:15:07,440 --> 00:15:08,000
are

406
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:11,120
lender levels schools police and

407
00:15:11,120 --> 00:15:14,399
so everything is very um regulated but

408
00:15:14,399 --> 00:15:16,320
sometimes in different ways and

409
00:15:16,320 --> 00:15:19,360
but in general um i think we

410
00:15:19,360 --> 00:15:20,880
it's uh it does make sense to

411
00:15:20,880 --> 00:15:23,199
overspecify but uh the handling of a

412
00:15:23,199 --> 00:15:24,240
complaint

413
00:15:24,240 --> 00:15:27,279
has to be of course with the right epa

414
00:15:27,279 --> 00:15:27,920
otherwise

415
00:15:27,920 --> 00:15:31,519
uh it's it's not helpful because uh it

416
00:15:31,519 --> 00:15:32,480
may not

417
00:15:32,480 --> 00:15:34,560
be enforceable and then the

418
00:15:34,560 --> 00:15:36,000
investigation of the case

419
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:39,680
starts and um this may take uh first

420
00:15:39,680 --> 00:15:41,360
months or longer and then

421
00:15:41,360 --> 00:15:43,680
uh the assessment uh will have a first

422
00:15:43,680 --> 00:15:44,399
solution

423
00:15:44,399 --> 00:15:47,600
what has happened we need a fair hearing

424
00:15:47,600 --> 00:15:49,519
this means if there is something where

425
00:15:49,519 --> 00:15:51,920
we see there's a breach or there has

426
00:15:51,920 --> 00:15:54,000
happened something which should not have

427
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:55,839
happened uh

428
00:15:55,839 --> 00:15:58,560
then we we have a preliminary

429
00:15:58,560 --> 00:16:00,639
preliminary assessment

430
00:16:00,639 --> 00:16:03,680
and asked the company the organization

431
00:16:03,680 --> 00:16:06,880
um what they say about it perhaps they

432
00:16:06,880 --> 00:16:09,920
they have another way of explaining why

433
00:16:09,920 --> 00:16:10,720
this happened

434
00:16:10,720 --> 00:16:13,759
perhaps it's a structural difficulty

435
00:16:13,759 --> 00:16:15,920
perhaps it's something where which

436
00:16:15,920 --> 00:16:18,800
has is based on a misunderstanding and

437
00:16:18,800 --> 00:16:20,160
there is no case

438
00:16:20,160 --> 00:16:23,519
um but this takes again um one or

439
00:16:23,519 --> 00:16:25,040
several months because usually

440
00:16:25,040 --> 00:16:26,959
usually it's a written hearing so we are

441
00:16:26,959 --> 00:16:28,720
sending letters they are answering or

442
00:16:28,720 --> 00:16:29,360
emails

443
00:16:29,360 --> 00:16:31,600
but they they are answering and then

444
00:16:31,600 --> 00:16:32,720
this may happen

445
00:16:32,720 --> 00:16:35,440
a few times there is a completion and i

446
00:16:35,440 --> 00:16:36,399
told you already

447
00:16:36,399 --> 00:16:39,440
that it's not only about fines um

448
00:16:39,440 --> 00:16:42,079
but also about other instruments i'll

449
00:16:42,079 --> 00:16:43,839
show you on the next slide

450
00:16:43,839 --> 00:16:47,040
and if the organizations are not

451
00:16:47,040 --> 00:16:49,680
uh believing what we our assessment they

452
00:16:49,680 --> 00:16:51,519
criticize that they can challenge it

453
00:16:51,519 --> 00:16:53,519
and there's legal remedy and they

454
00:16:53,519 --> 00:16:55,199
there's proceedings uh

455
00:16:55,199 --> 00:16:58,399
they can go before court

456
00:16:58,399 --> 00:17:00,240
so this is uh this is a list of the

457
00:17:00,240 --> 00:17:01,759
corrective powers and

458
00:17:01,759 --> 00:17:04,880
something is quite well not not so

459
00:17:04,880 --> 00:17:06,720
infringing in their

460
00:17:06,720 --> 00:17:09,760
uh business models um but some are

461
00:17:09,760 --> 00:17:13,280
are sometimes uh well they it means they

462
00:17:13,280 --> 00:17:14,160
they have to change

463
00:17:14,160 --> 00:17:16,799
something um i will tell you about each

464
00:17:16,799 --> 00:17:17,520
of them

465
00:17:17,520 --> 00:17:20,559
um issue a warning means if we

466
00:17:20,559 --> 00:17:23,199
have knowledge about something is going

467
00:17:23,199 --> 00:17:24,000
to happen

468
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:26,400
they explain to us they want to do some

469
00:17:26,400 --> 00:17:27,280
processing

470
00:17:27,280 --> 00:17:29,520
and we think this is not compliant we

471
00:17:29,520 --> 00:17:31,120
can issue a warning

472
00:17:31,120 --> 00:17:33,120
and so if you do that then there will be

473
00:17:33,120 --> 00:17:35,039
a breach and infringement of the law

474
00:17:35,039 --> 00:17:36,960
and you should not do that if they do it

475
00:17:36,960 --> 00:17:38,880
anyhow and we will find out then

476
00:17:38,880 --> 00:17:42,240
of course probably we will reassess the

477
00:17:42,240 --> 00:17:42,960
purpose but

478
00:17:42,960 --> 00:17:46,559
then we have to react issue represents a

479
00:17:46,559 --> 00:17:47,760
means exposed

480
00:17:47,760 --> 00:17:51,360
that if they the thing has already

481
00:17:51,360 --> 00:17:52,160
happened

482
00:17:52,160 --> 00:17:56,480
and can be people have sent an email to

483
00:17:56,480 --> 00:18:00,240
a list but they didn't put the

484
00:18:00,240 --> 00:18:03,760
recipients in the vcc blind carbon copy

485
00:18:03,760 --> 00:18:04,320
field

486
00:18:04,320 --> 00:18:08,240
but every email list every email address

487
00:18:08,240 --> 00:18:11,919
was accessible to the others

488
00:18:11,919 --> 00:18:14,320
the other recipients then usually if

489
00:18:14,320 --> 00:18:16,240
it's the first time and it

490
00:18:16,240 --> 00:18:19,120
happened on purpose and there's no high

491
00:18:19,120 --> 00:18:19,600
risk

492
00:18:19,600 --> 00:18:22,480
um content then it's only something

493
00:18:22,480 --> 00:18:23,039
where

494
00:18:23,039 --> 00:18:25,840
you have to take action that it does not

495
00:18:25,840 --> 00:18:27,600
happen again but there won't be

496
00:18:27,600 --> 00:18:30,799
anything more on that

497
00:18:30,799 --> 00:18:33,039
the the general the bottom line always

498
00:18:33,039 --> 00:18:34,880
is to order the controller

499
00:18:34,880 --> 00:18:37,200
or the responsible entity or the

500
00:18:37,200 --> 00:18:38,480
processors those

501
00:18:38,480 --> 00:18:40,080
who are doing the data processing on

502
00:18:40,080 --> 00:18:41,600
behalf of the controller

503
00:18:41,600 --> 00:18:44,799
to comply with the gdpr

504
00:18:44,799 --> 00:18:47,520
and this can also be the data subject's

505
00:18:47,520 --> 00:18:48,559
request

506
00:18:48,559 --> 00:18:50,480
access right for access replication

507
00:18:50,480 --> 00:18:51,840
erasure and so on

508
00:18:51,840 --> 00:18:54,240
and sometimes they did not do it at

509
00:18:54,240 --> 00:18:56,720
least not in a complete way or

510
00:18:56,720 --> 00:18:58,240
well there there have been some

511
00:18:58,240 --> 00:18:59,919
difficulties and this

512
00:18:59,919 --> 00:19:03,120
of course then has to has to change

513
00:19:03,120 --> 00:19:05,440
um also to bring processing operations

514
00:19:05,440 --> 00:19:06,240
fine so

515
00:19:06,240 --> 00:19:11,360
an order is an official letter and um

516
00:19:11,360 --> 00:19:14,559
it's at least if we issue

517
00:19:14,559 --> 00:19:18,400
an impose in a temporary or definitive

518
00:19:18,400 --> 00:19:21,200
limitation a ban on processing saying

519
00:19:21,200 --> 00:19:22,160
you must not

520
00:19:22,160 --> 00:19:25,440
do this kind of you cannot go on

521
00:19:25,440 --> 00:19:28,080
with your data processing in that way

522
00:19:28,080 --> 00:19:29,600
then it's something which

523
00:19:29,600 --> 00:19:33,440
stops their or has to stop their process

524
00:19:33,440 --> 00:19:35,760
and usually this is something where they

525
00:19:35,760 --> 00:19:37,600
in the hearing they say no of course we

526
00:19:37,600 --> 00:19:38,320
believe this

527
00:19:38,320 --> 00:19:41,520
is uh legally compliant and this means

528
00:19:41,520 --> 00:19:42,080
that they

529
00:19:42,080 --> 00:19:45,200
will go before god and stop our

530
00:19:45,200 --> 00:19:48,240
limitation order um

531
00:19:48,240 --> 00:19:50,640
the administrative fines for example uh

532
00:19:50,640 --> 00:19:51,360
they

533
00:19:51,360 --> 00:19:55,039
i already told you about that and so

534
00:19:55,039 --> 00:19:58,080
the legal remedies against our decisions

535
00:19:58,080 --> 00:20:00,880
are quite normal and i told you i'm a

536
00:20:00,880 --> 00:20:01,840
computer scientist

537
00:20:01,840 --> 00:20:04,080
i think courts are very valuable and we

538
00:20:04,080 --> 00:20:06,000
need them but this means we have

539
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:09,440
several cases right now the oldest one

540
00:20:09,440 --> 00:20:12,799
still that is still ongoing is already

541
00:20:12,799 --> 00:20:15,919
more than 10 years old because of so

542
00:20:15,919 --> 00:20:16,640
many

543
00:20:16,640 --> 00:20:20,000
cards being involved so many different

544
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:21,600
perspectives sometimes it takes two

545
00:20:21,600 --> 00:20:23,919
years between the first instance and the

546
00:20:23,919 --> 00:20:25,600
second instance and so on

547
00:20:25,600 --> 00:20:28,960
so it it's uh it stops um very often

548
00:20:28,960 --> 00:20:31,280
what we are doing there and uh that one

549
00:20:31,280 --> 00:20:32,960
one thing is about the video

550
00:20:32,960 --> 00:20:35,600
surveillance for example in a fitness

551
00:20:35,600 --> 00:20:36,559
studio

552
00:20:36,559 --> 00:20:39,679
and although we won the first

553
00:20:39,679 --> 00:20:43,039
uh our decision is has been confirmed

554
00:20:43,039 --> 00:20:45,760
by court they are now checking whether

555
00:20:45,760 --> 00:20:46,240
they

556
00:20:46,240 --> 00:20:48,320
want to have the next instance and this

557
00:20:48,320 --> 00:20:49,840
means it's not changed

558
00:20:49,840 --> 00:20:52,159
so the video surveillance is still going

559
00:20:52,159 --> 00:20:53,440
on and

560
00:20:53,440 --> 00:20:56,960
this also stops us and demotivates

561
00:20:56,960 --> 00:21:00,080
the data subjects demotivates us

562
00:21:00,080 --> 00:21:01,919
if we are doing investigations which is

563
00:21:01,919 --> 00:21:03,919
very necessary we see that

564
00:21:03,919 --> 00:21:06,159
usually the complaints only address the

565
00:21:06,159 --> 00:21:08,240
visible part so if you want access and

566
00:21:08,240 --> 00:21:09,440
you don't get access

567
00:21:09,440 --> 00:21:12,799
then you see you feel that this is

568
00:21:12,799 --> 00:21:14,720
not as you expect it's not the right

569
00:21:14,720 --> 00:21:16,159
thing but sometimes

570
00:21:16,159 --> 00:21:18,000
there are structural effects or

571
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:19,200
structural mistakes

572
00:21:19,200 --> 00:21:22,159
and you can hardly notice that some

573
00:21:22,159 --> 00:21:25,200
things are in the public area where

574
00:21:25,200 --> 00:21:28,640
for example the police control how does

575
00:21:28,640 --> 00:21:30,720
the police work

576
00:21:30,720 --> 00:21:32,960
do they take your data is there

577
00:21:32,960 --> 00:21:34,880
something happening where your

578
00:21:34,880 --> 00:21:37,120
ip address where your phone number plays

579
00:21:37,120 --> 00:21:37,919
a role

580
00:21:37,919 --> 00:21:40,000
and this is something where you hardly

581
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:40,960
notices

582
00:21:40,960 --> 00:21:43,840
notice or get the information beforehand

583
00:21:43,840 --> 00:21:44,320
and

584
00:21:44,320 --> 00:21:47,679
this means um the complaints are rare

585
00:21:47,679 --> 00:21:50,720
but this means for us that we have

586
00:21:50,720 --> 00:21:51,840
meanwhile mended

587
00:21:51,840 --> 00:21:54,240
mandatory investigations in the police

588
00:21:54,240 --> 00:21:54,960
sector

589
00:21:54,960 --> 00:21:56,880
and i think we needed also in other

590
00:21:56,880 --> 00:21:58,559
sectors where it's clear that we

591
00:21:58,559 --> 00:21:59,760
regularly

592
00:21:59,760 --> 00:22:02,960
have a check because otherwise it's not

593
00:22:02,960 --> 00:22:06,400
sufficient people won't notice what is

594
00:22:06,400 --> 00:22:07,520
what is happening so

595
00:22:07,520 --> 00:22:10,720
as a as this picture

596
00:22:10,720 --> 00:22:13,120
you only see the very top and perhaps

597
00:22:13,120 --> 00:22:14,960
the deficiencies

598
00:22:14,960 --> 00:22:19,280
are below sea level we we also have

599
00:22:19,280 --> 00:22:21,600
the problem of very often the data

600
00:22:21,600 --> 00:22:23,440
controllers cannot explain what is

601
00:22:23,440 --> 00:22:24,640
happening they don't know

602
00:22:24,640 --> 00:22:26,880
about their data processing and even if

603
00:22:26,880 --> 00:22:29,280
they ask their processors

604
00:22:29,280 --> 00:22:32,880
think of microsoft 365

605
00:22:32,880 --> 00:22:36,159
you still won't know exactly what is

606
00:22:36,159 --> 00:22:37,440
happening at least i

607
00:22:37,440 --> 00:22:39,200
i haven't understood everything and i

608
00:22:39,200 --> 00:22:40,960
haven't got all the information

609
00:22:40,960 --> 00:22:43,520
and perhaps you're better off but how

610
00:22:43,520 --> 00:22:45,280
does it work with an investigation

611
00:22:45,280 --> 00:22:47,679
can we stop uh data processing

612
00:22:47,679 --> 00:22:49,440
especially if it's something where

613
00:22:49,440 --> 00:22:51,039
people rely on that

614
00:22:51,039 --> 00:22:55,280
if it's in principle in non-audit

615
00:22:55,280 --> 00:22:58,000
the gdpr says they have to be

616
00:22:58,000 --> 00:22:59,679
accountable they have to

617
00:22:59,679 --> 00:23:02,000
give true they have to demonstrate the

618
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:03,440
compliance

619
00:23:03,440 --> 00:23:05,760
but this is something in reality which

620
00:23:05,760 --> 00:23:07,760
is often a problem

621
00:23:07,760 --> 00:23:09,840
also investigations are always happening

622
00:23:09,840 --> 00:23:10,880
after the fact

623
00:23:10,880 --> 00:23:13,360
um so that they are all already ongoing

624
00:23:13,360 --> 00:23:15,200
there is some other instrument like

625
00:23:15,200 --> 00:23:17,919
prior consultation then people think

626
00:23:17,919 --> 00:23:19,760
their organization thinks there may be a

627
00:23:19,760 --> 00:23:20,559
risk and then

628
00:23:20,559 --> 00:23:23,039
they can ask us beforehand but usually

629
00:23:23,039 --> 00:23:24,000
the data

630
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:27,039
processing um has started

631
00:23:27,039 --> 00:23:30,080
already and if we find out then if it's

632
00:23:30,080 --> 00:23:30,640
a breach

633
00:23:30,640 --> 00:23:31,679
then it's something where the

634
00:23:31,679 --> 00:23:33,760
organization also wants to correct it if

635
00:23:33,760 --> 00:23:34,799
it's something where they

636
00:23:34,799 --> 00:23:36,880
it's part of their business model they

637
00:23:36,880 --> 00:23:38,159
of course don't want to

638
00:23:38,159 --> 00:23:41,440
change what we also see uh one thing is

639
00:23:41,440 --> 00:23:41,919
the

640
00:23:41,919 --> 00:23:45,600
fan page uh case from facebook

641
00:23:45,600 --> 00:23:48,000
they are moving targets so if we find

642
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:49,120
out this is not

643
00:23:49,120 --> 00:23:52,320
legally compliant then there might be a

644
00:23:52,320 --> 00:23:53,600
small change

645
00:23:53,600 --> 00:23:56,880
and then we sometimes have to reassess

646
00:23:56,880 --> 00:23:59,039
everything not only the last pages of

647
00:23:59,039 --> 00:24:00,720
our assessment but perhaps

648
00:24:00,720 --> 00:24:03,760
the bottom line is thinking of something

649
00:24:03,760 --> 00:24:04,880
now which really

650
00:24:04,880 --> 00:24:06,960
made a change and if we find out no it's

651
00:24:06,960 --> 00:24:08,960
still or in another way

652
00:24:08,960 --> 00:24:12,080
and not legally compliant then again

653
00:24:12,080 --> 00:24:14,000
change can happen and it's very

654
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:15,200
difficult then

655
00:24:15,200 --> 00:24:18,480
to also to impose a ban

656
00:24:18,480 --> 00:24:21,919
or order something if the

657
00:24:21,919 --> 00:24:24,000
item of interest is changing all the

658
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:26,559
time and some organizations even

659
00:24:26,559 --> 00:24:29,679
don't change because they feel so secure

660
00:24:29,679 --> 00:24:32,080
and sometimes i feel like sisyphos so

661
00:24:32,080 --> 00:24:34,080
it's something where we always have to

662
00:24:34,080 --> 00:24:34,799
redo

663
00:24:34,799 --> 00:24:38,400
the work and um don't see a

664
00:24:38,400 --> 00:24:41,600
motivating result which does not mean

665
00:24:41,600 --> 00:24:43,600
that we we don't have any results it's

666
00:24:43,600 --> 00:24:44,799
only that some

667
00:24:44,799 --> 00:24:47,840
are have very professional means

668
00:24:47,840 --> 00:24:51,039
to evade evade the the well the

669
00:24:51,039 --> 00:24:52,320
compliance or the

670
00:24:52,320 --> 00:24:55,679
uh way to

671
00:24:55,679 --> 00:24:58,880
well that the dpas can really make a

672
00:24:58,880 --> 00:25:00,400
change

673
00:25:00,400 --> 00:25:03,279
but this also means that we are very

674
00:25:03,279 --> 00:25:04,320
often

675
00:25:04,320 --> 00:25:08,240
the target of attacks by by industry

676
00:25:08,240 --> 00:25:11,520
because our meanwhile our um

677
00:25:11,520 --> 00:25:14,320
if we have an assessment and publishing

678
00:25:14,320 --> 00:25:15,120
assessment

679
00:25:15,120 --> 00:25:17,120
about the processing is compliant or

680
00:25:17,120 --> 00:25:18,720
it's not compliant

681
00:25:18,720 --> 00:25:21,520
um then it can influence the market so

682
00:25:21,520 --> 00:25:23,679
this has changed a lot this means we are

683
00:25:23,679 --> 00:25:25,360
more powerful meanwhile

684
00:25:25,360 --> 00:25:26,960
on the other hand this means that it's

685
00:25:26,960 --> 00:25:28,720
always good to

686
00:25:28,720 --> 00:25:31,120
uh to go before court or to bash your

687
00:25:31,120 --> 00:25:31,840
dpa

688
00:25:31,840 --> 00:25:35,039
or to publicly uh attack

689
00:25:35,039 --> 00:25:38,159
dpas and privacy commissioners because

690
00:25:38,159 --> 00:25:41,760
um this may be another way of stopping

691
00:25:41,760 --> 00:25:42,559
their

692
00:25:42,559 --> 00:25:46,159
assessment or while trying to to silence

693
00:25:46,159 --> 00:25:47,520
them

694
00:25:47,520 --> 00:25:50,720
it's clear for us that a compliant thing

695
00:25:50,720 --> 00:25:52,640
of data processing is compliant only

696
00:25:52,640 --> 00:25:53,200
means

697
00:25:53,200 --> 00:25:56,320
at this second or when

698
00:25:56,320 --> 00:25:58,960
in the scope of our assessment the time

699
00:25:58,960 --> 00:25:59,520
and the

700
00:25:59,520 --> 00:26:01,440
time of our assessment and it can be

701
00:26:01,440 --> 00:26:03,440
based on our own investigation

702
00:26:03,440 --> 00:26:05,760
but um it can also be based on a

703
00:26:05,760 --> 00:26:07,039
non-existing but in

704
00:26:07,039 --> 00:26:10,080
our time will be existing certification

705
00:26:10,080 --> 00:26:12,480
or a court decision the final hot

706
00:26:12,480 --> 00:26:13,200
decision

707
00:26:13,200 --> 00:26:16,559
for most of the operations for most of

708
00:26:16,559 --> 00:26:17,760
the i.t systems

709
00:26:17,760 --> 00:26:21,200
is not the case so we don't

710
00:26:21,200 --> 00:26:24,000
know exactly have no internal

711
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:24,960
information

712
00:26:24,960 --> 00:26:27,200
sometimes we know it's not compliant

713
00:26:27,200 --> 00:26:28,720
again on the basis of

714
00:26:28,720 --> 00:26:31,520
basis of our own investigation and also

715
00:26:31,520 --> 00:26:32,480
with input

716
00:26:32,480 --> 00:26:34,640
of security researchers of privacy

717
00:26:34,640 --> 00:26:37,360
researchers so this is very important

718
00:26:37,360 --> 00:26:39,679
that and we at least my office is doing

719
00:26:39,679 --> 00:26:41,440
some monitoring on getting this

720
00:26:41,440 --> 00:26:43,120
information

721
00:26:43,120 --> 00:26:45,360
when there are problems when they are

722
00:26:45,360 --> 00:26:47,120
breaches but also when the

723
00:26:47,120 --> 00:26:49,760
business models rely on something which

724
00:26:49,760 --> 00:26:50,240
is not

725
00:26:50,240 --> 00:26:52,559
compliant but again if we want to

726
00:26:52,559 --> 00:26:53,279
publish

727
00:26:53,279 --> 00:26:55,679
this assessment we have to make sure

728
00:26:55,679 --> 00:26:56,480
this is

729
00:26:56,480 --> 00:27:00,159
in our jurisdiction or we are affected

730
00:27:00,159 --> 00:27:02,000
these we call stein citizens are

731
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:03,760
affected

732
00:27:03,760 --> 00:27:07,440
and otherwise the um competent

733
00:27:07,440 --> 00:27:10,240
uh competent data protection authority

734
00:27:10,240 --> 00:27:10,799
would

735
00:27:10,799 --> 00:27:13,440
would of course have the task to do that

736
00:27:13,440 --> 00:27:14,799
for some of them it's easy to

737
00:27:14,799 --> 00:27:15,520
collaborate

738
00:27:15,520 --> 00:27:18,240
and we will perhaps even share the

739
00:27:18,240 --> 00:27:20,480
investigation

740
00:27:20,480 --> 00:27:23,679
effort but sometimes it's clear that

741
00:27:23,679 --> 00:27:24,559
they

742
00:27:24,559 --> 00:27:26,720
they want to do their own investigation

743
00:27:26,720 --> 00:27:28,480
and

744
00:27:28,480 --> 00:27:30,240
it's not so much a collaboration and

745
00:27:30,240 --> 00:27:32,000
perhaps we even won't get

746
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:35,360
final results and very often we don't

747
00:27:35,360 --> 00:27:36,960
know exactly whether it's

748
00:27:36,960 --> 00:27:40,320
compliant or not but then again on a

749
00:27:40,320 --> 00:27:43,360
basis of a complaint we can go forward

750
00:27:43,360 --> 00:27:46,240
um because many people in the covert

751
00:27:46,240 --> 00:27:47,440
times wanted to know

752
00:27:47,440 --> 00:27:50,480
is this a good uh it's a good software

753
00:27:50,480 --> 00:27:52,640
or not please decide we want to

754
00:27:52,640 --> 00:27:55,840
be compliant but you have to to give us

755
00:27:55,840 --> 00:27:57,600
the information this is good this is not

756
00:27:57,600 --> 00:27:58,159
good

757
00:27:58,159 --> 00:28:00,559
and our berlin colleague did something

758
00:28:00,559 --> 00:28:02,399
like that and only on the

759
00:28:02,399 --> 00:28:04,640
or mainly on the basis of checking the

760
00:28:04,640 --> 00:28:05,919
data protection

761
00:28:05,919 --> 00:28:09,039
policies or contracts and

762
00:28:09,039 --> 00:28:11,600
seeing here with the traffic light model

763
00:28:11,600 --> 00:28:12,240
this is

764
00:28:12,240 --> 00:28:14,159
something which read in principle you

765
00:28:14,159 --> 00:28:16,000
can use it in a data protection

766
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:18,399
compliant way or it's red because there

767
00:28:18,399 --> 00:28:20,000
are some difficulties

768
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:22,480
can be belonging to shrimps too that

769
00:28:22,480 --> 00:28:23,200
means that

770
00:28:23,200 --> 00:28:25,840
data are being transferred from from

771
00:28:25,840 --> 00:28:27,760
europe without a legal

772
00:28:27,760 --> 00:28:31,919
um with the databases or without

773
00:28:31,919 --> 00:28:33,600
supplementary measures and so on

774
00:28:33,600 --> 00:28:36,640
so but they got very very much

775
00:28:36,640 --> 00:28:38,640
difficulties when they publish that and

776
00:28:38,640 --> 00:28:40,799
they they stopped publishing that for

777
00:28:40,799 --> 00:28:43,679
for some days i think only to check it

778
00:28:43,679 --> 00:28:44,399
again

779
00:28:44,399 --> 00:28:46,880
because big company said but you you

780
00:28:46,880 --> 00:28:48,320
mentioned our name here

781
00:28:48,320 --> 00:28:51,440
and we don't think that you should uh

782
00:28:51,440 --> 00:28:52,960
put us together with a red

783
00:28:52,960 --> 00:28:55,919
traffic light and then they they wanted

784
00:28:55,919 --> 00:28:57,360
to go before court or

785
00:28:57,360 --> 00:28:59,279
saying you must not publish this

786
00:28:59,279 --> 00:29:00,799
information anymore

787
00:29:00,799 --> 00:29:04,080
at least what we could agree uh in

788
00:29:04,080 --> 00:29:05,760
germany and i also know it from some

789
00:29:05,760 --> 00:29:07,120
other countries

790
00:29:07,120 --> 00:29:09,520
that we can provide checklists because i

791
00:29:09,520 --> 00:29:10,240
think i

792
00:29:10,240 --> 00:29:13,440
know about about 40 video conferencing

793
00:29:13,440 --> 00:29:15,520
tools not that i have used them perhaps

794
00:29:15,520 --> 00:29:16,399
10

795
00:29:16,399 --> 00:29:18,799
but that i know that so many are being

796
00:29:18,799 --> 00:29:20,159
offered and many people

797
00:29:20,159 --> 00:29:22,720
are writing emails for the dpa saying oh

798
00:29:22,720 --> 00:29:24,880
we have a good alternative please

799
00:29:24,880 --> 00:29:28,080
recommend our system which we cannot

800
00:29:28,080 --> 00:29:29,200
investigate

801
00:29:29,200 --> 00:29:33,279
so much because uh how much effort can

802
00:29:33,279 --> 00:29:34,960
do we have to put in something where we

803
00:29:34,960 --> 00:29:37,200
say it's now between light we can really

804
00:29:37,200 --> 00:29:38,080
be sure

805
00:29:38,080 --> 00:29:40,720
that this is something we can recommend

806
00:29:40,720 --> 00:29:42,159
um so usually we

807
00:29:42,159 --> 00:29:44,480
our our resources are bound already with

808
00:29:44,480 --> 00:29:46,080
handling complaints

809
00:29:46,080 --> 00:29:48,159
with this checklist here on data

810
00:29:48,159 --> 00:29:50,000
protection and video conferencing

811
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:53,279
the organizations the data controllers

812
00:29:53,279 --> 00:29:53,600
can

813
00:29:53,600 --> 00:29:56,640
check or also when they do procurement

814
00:29:56,640 --> 00:30:00,960
can ask the vendors

815
00:30:00,960 --> 00:30:03,679
whether they comply or not or how they

816
00:30:03,679 --> 00:30:04,720
interpret that and

817
00:30:04,720 --> 00:30:06,559
at least it's something where they have

818
00:30:06,559 --> 00:30:08,960
a discussion basis

819
00:30:08,960 --> 00:30:11,840
we also saw that some of the vendors use

820
00:30:11,840 --> 00:30:12,559
that

821
00:30:12,559 --> 00:30:14,320
checklist and say oh we've filled it in

822
00:30:14,320 --> 00:30:16,399
for you the data controller

823
00:30:16,399 --> 00:30:18,880
in the school sector for example please

824
00:30:18,880 --> 00:30:19,520
use now

825
00:30:19,520 --> 00:30:22,159
our system we have done everything the

826
00:30:22,159 --> 00:30:23,919
data protection commissioners in germany

827
00:30:23,919 --> 00:30:25,200
wanted us to do

828
00:30:25,200 --> 00:30:28,399
and not every field was properly filled

829
00:30:28,399 --> 00:30:28,720
in

830
00:30:28,720 --> 00:30:31,520
there are some misinterpretations but as

831
00:30:31,520 --> 00:30:33,440
a data controller it's sometimes very

832
00:30:33,440 --> 00:30:34,320
difficult

833
00:30:34,320 --> 00:30:37,679
inside it's very specific and again the

834
00:30:37,679 --> 00:30:41,120
moving target problems also we see that

835
00:30:41,120 --> 00:30:44,799
um some some problems are

836
00:30:44,799 --> 00:30:47,840
perhaps also a cultural thing

837
00:30:47,840 --> 00:30:50,880
and not everybody agrees whether they

838
00:30:50,880 --> 00:30:51,840
are

839
00:30:51,840 --> 00:30:54,960
a structural of structural value or not

840
00:30:54,960 --> 00:30:57,120
so you see on the left side a very old

841
00:30:57,120 --> 00:30:59,279
case a google street view you know

842
00:30:59,279 --> 00:31:01,760
the maps with some pictures in them

843
00:31:01,760 --> 00:31:02,880
there's some photos

844
00:31:02,880 --> 00:31:06,399
with these street view cars and here

845
00:31:06,399 --> 00:31:10,000
this is a headline from 2008

846
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:13,120
13 years old german towns is saying nine

847
00:31:13,120 --> 00:31:16,799
to google's review and they mention the

848
00:31:16,799 --> 00:31:19,760
very small town wolfsie this is about

849
00:31:19,760 --> 00:31:21,600
eight kilometers from here

850
00:31:21,600 --> 00:31:24,799
um and uh there are about 5000

851
00:31:24,799 --> 00:31:27,840
citizens and they said no we don't want

852
00:31:27,840 --> 00:31:30,960
a car a camera looking into

853
00:31:30,960 --> 00:31:33,600
our gardens and seeing whether we have

854
00:31:33,600 --> 00:31:35,519
cars there which kind of cars

855
00:31:35,519 --> 00:31:38,240
and even the last sentence of the mayor

856
00:31:38,240 --> 00:31:38,720
i think

857
00:31:38,720 --> 00:31:40,640
our leader of the city of the party in

858
00:31:40,640 --> 00:31:42,320
the town council said you can see

859
00:31:42,320 --> 00:31:43,840
everything in those photos that is

860
00:31:43,840 --> 00:31:45,120
opening house and home

861
00:31:45,120 --> 00:31:48,480
to criminals um

862
00:31:48,480 --> 00:31:51,600
obviously we um that there was a big

863
00:31:51,600 --> 00:31:54,880
debate uh especially in germany there

864
00:31:54,880 --> 00:31:56,559
were some debates in other countries but

865
00:31:56,559 --> 00:31:57,360
especially

866
00:31:57,360 --> 00:31:59,919
in germany and if you look now into

867
00:31:59,919 --> 00:32:01,519
google maps and see the

868
00:32:01,519 --> 00:32:05,679
new uh provisions um there are hardly

869
00:32:05,679 --> 00:32:08,320
any pictures there some from uh for for

870
00:32:08,320 --> 00:32:09,039
big cities

871
00:32:09,039 --> 00:32:11,200
in in germany but also there's an

872
00:32:11,200 --> 00:32:12,559
opt-out

873
00:32:12,559 --> 00:32:15,679
a way there's of course this blurring um

874
00:32:15,679 --> 00:32:16,320
so

875
00:32:16,320 --> 00:32:18,960
google changed their system they offered

876
00:32:18,960 --> 00:32:20,080
a lot

877
00:32:20,080 --> 00:32:22,480
because there were other problems as

878
00:32:22,480 --> 00:32:25,120
well perhaps you remember that

879
00:32:25,120 --> 00:32:28,399
wi-fi data was recorded and there were

880
00:32:28,399 --> 00:32:30,159
other problems as well

881
00:32:30,159 --> 00:32:32,399
um but i think it's rather a

882
00:32:32,399 --> 00:32:34,240
communication disaster from that

883
00:32:34,240 --> 00:32:37,519
time when apple look around came up a

884
00:32:37,519 --> 00:32:41,360
few years ago again several people

885
00:32:41,360 --> 00:32:43,360
did not agree that they should have

886
00:32:43,360 --> 00:32:45,200
looked via their cameras or published

887
00:32:45,200 --> 00:32:46,799
that information

888
00:32:46,799 --> 00:32:50,399
but i think the cultural uh

889
00:32:50,399 --> 00:32:53,840
um the cultural debate was more the old

890
00:32:53,840 --> 00:32:55,039
people did not like it

891
00:32:55,039 --> 00:32:57,440
and the younger people said let's let's

892
00:32:57,440 --> 00:32:58,480
have a look it's

893
00:32:58,480 --> 00:33:00,399
something we can have a look outside we

894
00:33:00,399 --> 00:33:02,240
can had always

895
00:33:02,240 --> 00:33:04,640
uh have our own photos and of course

896
00:33:04,640 --> 00:33:06,320
this is always difficult

897
00:33:06,320 --> 00:33:09,120
whereas now the line between what is uh

898
00:33:09,120 --> 00:33:10,159
public information

899
00:33:10,159 --> 00:33:12,320
and should be public information and

900
00:33:12,320 --> 00:33:13,600
what is something where

901
00:33:13,600 --> 00:33:16,960
private information affected the right

902
00:33:16,960 --> 00:33:17,679
uh

903
00:33:17,679 --> 00:33:20,320
news here is not so old it's from from

904
00:33:20,320 --> 00:33:22,159
last year and also this year

905
00:33:22,159 --> 00:33:24,320
it has been very much debated the tesla

906
00:33:24,320 --> 00:33:26,080
cars with their sentry

907
00:33:26,080 --> 00:33:29,039
mode because they are also doing some

908
00:33:29,039 --> 00:33:29,840
some

909
00:33:29,840 --> 00:33:32,880
um video surveillance of the public area

910
00:33:32,880 --> 00:33:33,360
the

911
00:33:33,360 --> 00:33:36,799
open um room there

912
00:33:36,799 --> 00:33:40,720
and um which meanwhile is very much

913
00:33:40,720 --> 00:33:42,640
debated whether this is illegal whether

914
00:33:42,640 --> 00:33:45,039
there are something like

915
00:33:45,039 --> 00:33:48,159
if you touch a tesla car and then the

916
00:33:48,159 --> 00:33:51,200
the sensors only begin recording that

917
00:33:51,200 --> 00:33:52,080
then it's different

918
00:33:52,080 --> 00:33:55,360
from doing that

919
00:33:55,360 --> 00:33:58,000
all over the time but in general we have

920
00:33:58,000 --> 00:33:58,960
to first see

921
00:33:58,960 --> 00:34:00,960
other complaints because then we are

922
00:34:00,960 --> 00:34:02,640
already in and we have to handle

923
00:34:02,640 --> 00:34:03,440
complaints

924
00:34:03,440 --> 00:34:06,880
all normal complaints have to be entered

925
00:34:06,880 --> 00:34:08,800
but very often it's not that a

926
00:34:08,800 --> 00:34:10,480
structural problem here i would agree

927
00:34:10,480 --> 00:34:11,119
that there

928
00:34:11,119 --> 00:34:13,599
are structural problems although and we

929
00:34:13,599 --> 00:34:14,320
we

930
00:34:14,320 --> 00:34:17,520
have video surveillance cases um

931
00:34:17,520 --> 00:34:20,719
more than 100 a year uh and

932
00:34:20,719 --> 00:34:22,879
one person works only on video

933
00:34:22,879 --> 00:34:23,839
surveillance

934
00:34:23,839 --> 00:34:27,440
cases but is this now something where we

935
00:34:27,440 --> 00:34:29,199
can also have a structural

936
00:34:29,199 --> 00:34:32,480
solution something where um

937
00:34:32,480 --> 00:34:35,199
it's much much easier uh perhaps for

938
00:34:35,199 --> 00:34:36,320
everybody to

939
00:34:36,320 --> 00:34:39,440
to apply uh to comply with the law

940
00:34:39,440 --> 00:34:41,280
because right now they uh people go to

941
00:34:41,280 --> 00:34:42,719
the this counter by

942
00:34:42,719 --> 00:34:44,560
their video surveillance their webcam

943
00:34:44,560 --> 00:34:45,918
their of course was

944
00:34:45,918 --> 00:34:48,639
we are now also using our webcams that

945
00:34:48,639 --> 00:34:49,520
the dash cam

946
00:34:49,520 --> 00:34:52,399
for their cars and very often it's at

947
00:34:52,399 --> 00:34:52,879
least

948
00:34:52,879 --> 00:34:55,599
the way it's being used not legally

949
00:34:55,599 --> 00:34:56,560
compliant

950
00:34:56,560 --> 00:34:58,640
and this means who to address is it

951
00:34:58,640 --> 00:35:00,079
really something where the private

952
00:35:00,079 --> 00:35:02,160
people the private persons should be

953
00:35:02,160 --> 00:35:03,760
applied or the vendors

954
00:35:03,760 --> 00:35:05,599
because both are not addressed by the

955
00:35:05,599 --> 00:35:07,200
gdpr

956
00:35:07,200 --> 00:35:10,160
but in this case the private people are

957
00:35:10,160 --> 00:35:11,760
not so private because they are using

958
00:35:11,760 --> 00:35:12,720
the public space

959
00:35:12,720 --> 00:35:16,480
but the vendors would not

960
00:35:16,480 --> 00:35:19,680
could try to sell their goods without

961
00:35:19,680 --> 00:35:22,000
being compliant and also here we see

962
00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:23,599
other member states perhaps

963
00:35:23,599 --> 00:35:26,800
have other cultural backgrounds

964
00:35:26,800 --> 00:35:29,760
let's go now to article 25 i told you

965
00:35:29,760 --> 00:35:30,640
already it may

966
00:35:30,640 --> 00:35:33,920
may not be so attractive to read and we

967
00:35:33,920 --> 00:35:34,640
see it here

968
00:35:34,640 --> 00:35:36,800
the first paragraph in an abbreviated

969
00:35:36,800 --> 00:35:38,800
way taking into account

970
00:35:38,800 --> 00:35:40,720
the state of the art the cost of

971
00:35:40,720 --> 00:35:42,480
implementation and so on

972
00:35:42,480 --> 00:35:45,599
um the well the risk of

973
00:35:45,599 --> 00:35:48,800
likely uh very likelihood and then the

974
00:35:48,800 --> 00:35:50,320
controller should implement

975
00:35:50,320 --> 00:35:52,720
appropriate technical and organization

976
00:35:52,720 --> 00:35:53,520
measures

977
00:35:53,520 --> 00:35:55,760
to implement the data protection

978
00:35:55,760 --> 00:35:56,960
principles

979
00:35:56,960 --> 00:36:00,000
um what i think everybody agrees it's

980
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:00,480
about

981
00:36:00,480 --> 00:36:03,359
the full life cycle it's something where

982
00:36:03,359 --> 00:36:05,040
data minimization

983
00:36:05,040 --> 00:36:07,920
uh should be applied very much and also

984
00:36:07,920 --> 00:36:08,400
that we

985
00:36:08,400 --> 00:36:11,440
next paragraph here or the second part

986
00:36:11,440 --> 00:36:12,400
of the article

987
00:36:12,400 --> 00:36:14,880
it's also about the defaults setting the

988
00:36:14,880 --> 00:36:17,119
right defaults or presettings

989
00:36:17,119 --> 00:36:19,520
in reality i hardly see any good

990
00:36:19,520 --> 00:36:20,240
defaults

991
00:36:20,240 --> 00:36:21,839
especially in the online world very

992
00:36:21,839 --> 00:36:24,560
often it's the other way around

993
00:36:24,560 --> 00:36:28,000
that the greedy business models and so

994
00:36:28,000 --> 00:36:28,960
it's

995
00:36:28,960 --> 00:36:31,920
it's more difficult for people to

996
00:36:31,920 --> 00:36:34,160
protect their personal data

997
00:36:34,160 --> 00:36:37,520
but um how to

998
00:36:37,520 --> 00:36:40,160
to bring it into reality um i think i

999
00:36:40,160 --> 00:36:40,560
will

1000
00:36:40,560 --> 00:36:42,720
rush a little bit through this part but

1001
00:36:42,720 --> 00:36:44,720
because it has been very much published

1002
00:36:44,720 --> 00:36:45,599
and go

1003
00:36:45,599 --> 00:36:48,560
um then into more detail after a few

1004
00:36:48,560 --> 00:36:49,280
slides

1005
00:36:49,280 --> 00:36:51,200
of course we can think about how to

1006
00:36:51,200 --> 00:36:53,359
apply those data protection principles

1007
00:36:53,359 --> 00:36:56,960
and meanwhile there has been some work

1008
00:36:56,960 --> 00:36:59,359
trying to do that but think of the whole

1009
00:36:59,359 --> 00:37:01,359
the entire system and not only

1010
00:37:01,359 --> 00:37:03,680
one principle um and it's about

1011
00:37:03,680 --> 00:37:04,480
technical

1012
00:37:04,480 --> 00:37:06,880
and organizational measures it's not

1013
00:37:06,880 --> 00:37:09,119
only about itc

1014
00:37:09,119 --> 00:37:11,440
um a standard data protection model is a

1015
00:37:11,440 --> 00:37:13,839
little bit older than the gdpr

1016
00:37:13,839 --> 00:37:16,800
and we also tried to and i was one of

1017
00:37:16,800 --> 00:37:17,440
those who

1018
00:37:17,440 --> 00:37:21,680
are and still are trying to give help

1019
00:37:21,680 --> 00:37:22,800
and

1020
00:37:22,800 --> 00:37:25,520
developers because it's an extension of

1021
00:37:25,520 --> 00:37:27,200
the confidentiality integrity

1022
00:37:27,200 --> 00:37:29,359
availability system of the it security

1023
00:37:29,359 --> 00:37:29,839
world

1024
00:37:29,839 --> 00:37:32,320
by unlinkability so splitting

1025
00:37:32,320 --> 00:37:33,280
information

1026
00:37:33,280 --> 00:37:36,880
transparency being able to inform about

1027
00:37:36,880 --> 00:37:37,800
that and also

1028
00:37:37,800 --> 00:37:40,640
intervenability the possibility for

1029
00:37:40,640 --> 00:37:42,720
people to react to

1030
00:37:42,720 --> 00:37:43,480
to

1031
00:37:43,480 --> 00:37:46,240
[Music]

1032
00:37:46,240 --> 00:37:48,560
perhaps also stop a processing to

1033
00:37:48,560 --> 00:37:50,880
intervene to get their rights

1034
00:37:50,880 --> 00:37:53,680
data minimization is something which is

1035
00:37:53,680 --> 00:37:54,400
always

1036
00:37:54,400 --> 00:37:56,880
necessary i personally think it's part

1037
00:37:56,880 --> 00:37:58,800
of the unlinkability debate but some

1038
00:37:58,800 --> 00:37:59,359
people

1039
00:37:59,359 --> 00:38:02,640
like it more well in an extra way

1040
00:38:02,640 --> 00:38:05,760
and um here we i i always already

1041
00:38:05,760 --> 00:38:07,839
explained it and you know that better

1042
00:38:07,839 --> 00:38:10,240
perhaps even better than me how to deal

1043
00:38:10,240 --> 00:38:11,760
with that

1044
00:38:11,760 --> 00:38:14,560
even um but but still it's about the

1045
00:38:14,560 --> 00:38:15,359
risks

1046
00:38:15,359 --> 00:38:16,880
and rights and freedoms of natural

1047
00:38:16,880 --> 00:38:18,560
persons not not

1048
00:38:18,560 --> 00:38:21,839
one size fits its own and one of the

1049
00:38:21,839 --> 00:38:22,720
criteria

1050
00:38:22,720 --> 00:38:25,119
was here state of the art so how

1051
00:38:25,119 --> 00:38:26,560
important is this state-of-the-art

1052
00:38:26,560 --> 00:38:28,240
because um

1053
00:38:28,240 --> 00:38:31,440
pet community is doing something you're

1054
00:38:31,440 --> 00:38:34,560
at the forefront of and research is

1055
00:38:34,560 --> 00:38:36,320
of course at the forefront where

1056
00:38:36,320 --> 00:38:37,680
something is

1057
00:38:37,680 --> 00:38:40,720
not yet state of the art does it have

1058
00:38:40,720 --> 00:38:41,200
now

1059
00:38:41,200 --> 00:38:44,240
some influence for the dpas and from

1060
00:38:44,240 --> 00:38:46,160
my perspective yes it should have and it

1061
00:38:46,160 --> 00:38:47,839
will have and it has to have

1062
00:38:47,839 --> 00:38:51,040
uh influence but still our controllers

1063
00:38:51,040 --> 00:38:53,359
so controllers in my area here they want

1064
00:38:53,359 --> 00:38:55,119
standard market solutions

1065
00:38:55,119 --> 00:38:57,280
therefore the big players offering

1066
00:38:57,280 --> 00:38:59,359
something where you don't have to care

1067
00:38:59,359 --> 00:39:01,960
where everything is already done this is

1068
00:39:01,960 --> 00:39:03,359
[Music]

1069
00:39:03,359 --> 00:39:05,520
usually something people go for some

1070
00:39:05,520 --> 00:39:07,280
develop their own solutions

1071
00:39:07,280 --> 00:39:11,440
and here i i really um

1072
00:39:11,599 --> 00:39:14,000
i think we have to pronounce the

1073
00:39:14,000 --> 00:39:15,839
research and development as well

1074
00:39:15,839 --> 00:39:20,160
because it's about having some solutions

1075
00:39:20,160 --> 00:39:22,640
open source code must not be

1076
00:39:22,640 --> 00:39:23,920
underestimated

1077
00:39:23,920 --> 00:39:27,119
because if it's there and if

1078
00:39:27,119 --> 00:39:29,920
of course at best maintained in a way

1079
00:39:29,920 --> 00:39:30,560
then

1080
00:39:30,560 --> 00:39:33,760
we can use as a dpa that for arguing

1081
00:39:33,760 --> 00:39:35,760
you have to consider this as an

1082
00:39:35,760 --> 00:39:36,800
alternative

1083
00:39:36,800 --> 00:39:42,400
as well but usually it's not our task

1084
00:39:42,400 --> 00:39:44,400
which alternatives exist so we don't

1085
00:39:44,400 --> 00:39:45,920
have a market overview

1086
00:39:45,920 --> 00:39:48,079
and we cannot have a market overview we

1087
00:39:48,079 --> 00:39:50,880
even must be independent uh usually from

1088
00:39:50,880 --> 00:39:51,920
from the market

1089
00:39:51,920 --> 00:39:55,119
but still if something has

1090
00:39:55,119 --> 00:39:58,240
failures or their risks then and they're

1091
00:39:58,240 --> 00:40:00,160
better solutions

1092
00:40:00,160 --> 00:40:01,760
if the risk is not bearable if the

1093
00:40:01,760 --> 00:40:03,599
remedies are not sufficient

1094
00:40:03,599 --> 00:40:06,640
then this may be a way out i want to

1095
00:40:06,640 --> 00:40:07,200
point you

1096
00:40:07,200 --> 00:40:10,480
also to kind of thinking of readiness

1097
00:40:10,480 --> 00:40:10,800
and

1098
00:40:10,800 --> 00:40:13,359
analysis for the adoption evolution we

1099
00:40:13,359 --> 00:40:13,920
um

1100
00:40:13,920 --> 00:40:17,119
use that as in a project i learned

1101
00:40:17,119 --> 00:40:19,920
from the technology maturity whale you

1102
00:40:19,920 --> 00:40:22,160
see here the shape of the whale

1103
00:40:22,160 --> 00:40:25,440
and um here um

1104
00:40:25,440 --> 00:40:27,520
of course there are some parts where we

1105
00:40:27,520 --> 00:40:29,119
see already crypto is

1106
00:40:29,119 --> 00:40:31,359
is not state of the art anymore or think

1107
00:40:31,359 --> 00:40:33,040
of windows xp or so

1108
00:40:33,040 --> 00:40:36,000
still if i have a look here in our

1109
00:40:36,000 --> 00:40:38,960
investigations there are sometimes

1110
00:40:38,960 --> 00:40:42,000
those techniques still existing

1111
00:40:42,000 --> 00:40:44,319
and there there might be even a way

1112
00:40:44,319 --> 00:40:45,520
where it's legally

1113
00:40:45,520 --> 00:40:48,880
okay to still use

1114
00:40:48,880 --> 00:40:50,720
those systems usually if they're not

1115
00:40:50,720 --> 00:40:52,240
connected to the internet and they are

1116
00:40:52,240 --> 00:40:53,520
very much secured

1117
00:40:53,520 --> 00:40:56,960
because sometimes um the migration for

1118
00:40:56,960 --> 00:40:59,920
very specific software which is not

1119
00:40:59,920 --> 00:41:03,280
maintained anymore um may be too

1120
00:41:03,280 --> 00:41:05,280
expensive or too difficult and per

1121
00:41:05,280 --> 00:41:07,839
person for some archiving purposes

1122
00:41:07,839 --> 00:41:10,240
even old systems are kept up but of

1123
00:41:10,240 --> 00:41:11,280
course not

1124
00:41:11,280 --> 00:41:13,040
if there are no updates anymore they

1125
00:41:13,040 --> 00:41:15,040
must not be used in a

1126
00:41:15,040 --> 00:41:19,200
network or not in that connected way

1127
00:41:19,200 --> 00:41:21,440
okay for a readiness scale we also

1128
00:41:21,440 --> 00:41:22,720
thought about and now

1129
00:41:22,720 --> 00:41:25,280
think again of about research the idea

1130
00:41:25,280 --> 00:41:27,599
the research the proof of concept

1131
00:41:27,599 --> 00:41:30,480
pilots the products and if it's outdated

1132
00:41:30,480 --> 00:41:31,920
and not maintained

1133
00:41:31,920 --> 00:41:34,720
anymore and um but we must not uh

1134
00:41:34,720 --> 00:41:35,920
discuss it

1135
00:41:35,920 --> 00:41:38,160
only from a maturity or readiness

1136
00:41:38,160 --> 00:41:39,520
perspective we need the

1137
00:41:39,520 --> 00:41:42,800
quality if it's bad bad

1138
00:41:42,800 --> 00:41:46,960
or risky technology then we don't want

1139
00:41:46,960 --> 00:41:48,640
to say it's state of the art because of

1140
00:41:48,640 --> 00:41:50,400
course the other right here are not

1141
00:41:50,400 --> 00:41:51,119
fulfilled

1142
00:41:51,119 --> 00:41:54,000
and we tried to have this very basic

1143
00:41:54,000 --> 00:41:55,359
schema with

1144
00:41:55,359 --> 00:41:58,720
minus minus two plus plus and

1145
00:41:58,720 --> 00:42:00,640
also thought about some some more

1146
00:42:00,640 --> 00:42:03,280
criteria about the protection the trust

1147
00:42:03,280 --> 00:42:04,240
assumptions

1148
00:42:04,240 --> 00:42:06,560
i think also about central centralized

1149
00:42:06,560 --> 00:42:07,520
decentralized

1150
00:42:07,520 --> 00:42:10,319
data processing side effects that are

1151
00:42:10,319 --> 00:42:11,839
possible or can be

1152
00:42:11,839 --> 00:42:14,880
excluded hopefully uh the reliability

1153
00:42:14,880 --> 00:42:16,800
and so on and um

1154
00:42:16,800 --> 00:42:19,920
have an overall total quality so

1155
00:42:19,920 --> 00:42:23,520
let's combine it now with article 25

1156
00:42:23,520 --> 00:42:26,800
so what does this article ask for

1157
00:42:26,800 --> 00:42:29,359
and i've one one proposal here it may be

1158
00:42:29,359 --> 00:42:30,000
something

1159
00:42:30,000 --> 00:42:33,280
you see in the middle line which is

1160
00:42:33,280 --> 00:42:36,800
legally okay of course if it's a product

1161
00:42:36,800 --> 00:42:40,000
then it may be sufficient but uh proof

1162
00:42:40,000 --> 00:42:41,119
of concepts

1163
00:42:41,119 --> 00:42:43,599
from that are very very good very very

1164
00:42:43,599 --> 00:42:44,400
mature

1165
00:42:44,400 --> 00:42:46,720
and have a good quality of pets

1166
00:42:46,720 --> 00:42:48,480
shouldn't they be considered

1167
00:42:48,480 --> 00:42:51,440
or should we even have a broader view

1168
00:42:51,440 --> 00:42:52,240
and think of

1169
00:42:52,240 --> 00:42:54,400
ideas so if there's a published idea in

1170
00:42:54,400 --> 00:42:55,760
the patch community

1171
00:42:55,760 --> 00:42:57,440
could this be now something where the

1172
00:42:57,440 --> 00:42:59,040
dpa said but

1173
00:42:59,040 --> 00:43:02,079
we should know that i agree we should

1174
00:43:02,079 --> 00:43:03,760
demand it

1175
00:43:03,760 --> 00:43:06,800
um well that's usually difficult or do

1176
00:43:06,800 --> 00:43:08,880
we step back and only have this which

1177
00:43:08,880 --> 00:43:10,240
probably is approved by

1178
00:43:10,240 --> 00:43:13,839
the courts if their products

1179
00:43:13,839 --> 00:43:16,880
and they are at least okay then article

1180
00:43:16,880 --> 00:43:18,400
25 would be

1181
00:43:18,400 --> 00:43:20,160
will fit this is a little bit

1182
00:43:20,160 --> 00:43:21,599
disappointing

1183
00:43:21,599 --> 00:43:24,319
so we we need some some parts where we

1184
00:43:24,319 --> 00:43:25,359
can advance

1185
00:43:25,359 --> 00:43:28,160
the state of the art and not only of

1186
00:43:28,160 --> 00:43:28,480
course

1187
00:43:28,480 --> 00:43:31,920
looking at one pet component but

1188
00:43:31,920 --> 00:43:35,599
i i like to to get more of the

1189
00:43:35,599 --> 00:43:38,240
good research the good systems the good

1190
00:43:38,240 --> 00:43:38,880
ideas

1191
00:43:38,880 --> 00:43:42,880
into reality and then there's a question

1192
00:43:42,880 --> 00:43:43,440
whether

1193
00:43:43,440 --> 00:43:46,160
the excellence counts anything um

1194
00:43:46,160 --> 00:43:47,599
perhaps not today

1195
00:43:47,599 --> 00:43:51,119
because usually record would prove

1196
00:43:51,119 --> 00:43:54,079
good enough but if we go ahead and look

1197
00:43:54,079 --> 00:43:55,280
into the future

1198
00:43:55,280 --> 00:43:57,680
uh perhaps three years time or so and

1199
00:43:57,680 --> 00:43:59,280
this is something where the dpas can

1200
00:43:59,280 --> 00:43:59,760
also

1201
00:43:59,760 --> 00:44:02,480
give some advice saying today it may be

1202
00:44:02,480 --> 00:44:04,640
sufficient with this kind of

1203
00:44:04,640 --> 00:44:08,160
let's say crypto but um be aware there

1204
00:44:08,160 --> 00:44:09,040
will be

1205
00:44:09,040 --> 00:44:10,880
changes there will be better ways to

1206
00:44:10,880 --> 00:44:12,960
attack a system but there will also

1207
00:44:12,960 --> 00:44:15,040
there is already uh perhaps proof of

1208
00:44:15,040 --> 00:44:16,640
concept of better

1209
00:44:16,640 --> 00:44:20,079
solutions you may be okay right now but

1210
00:44:20,079 --> 00:44:20,480
not

1211
00:44:20,480 --> 00:44:23,359
in three years time so kind of early

1212
00:44:23,359 --> 00:44:25,440
warning

1213
00:44:25,440 --> 00:44:28,000
so what what about now the conclusion um

1214
00:44:28,000 --> 00:44:29,440
of now i i can

1215
00:44:29,440 --> 00:44:31,359
show you the full picture building this

1216
00:44:31,359 --> 00:44:33,440
is sustainable and resilient systems

1217
00:44:33,440 --> 00:44:35,119
without undesired side effects is of

1218
00:44:35,119 --> 00:44:37,280
course not easy at all

1219
00:44:37,280 --> 00:44:39,680
and only doing some pet component

1220
00:44:39,680 --> 00:44:40,640
research is

1221
00:44:40,640 --> 00:44:44,800
sometimes not not the same but obviously

1222
00:44:44,800 --> 00:44:46,640
the community is very ambitious and

1223
00:44:46,640 --> 00:44:47,839
sometimes the

1224
00:44:47,839 --> 00:44:51,280
reality is less i want to

1225
00:44:51,280 --> 00:44:54,640
tell you now my findings

1226
00:44:54,640 --> 00:44:56,960
i think data protection by design and by

1227
00:44:56,960 --> 00:44:58,800
default is not only demanded

1228
00:44:58,800 --> 00:45:02,240
by article 25 and the gdpr but is to be

1229
00:45:02,240 --> 00:45:04,400
demanded by controllers and we

1230
00:45:04,400 --> 00:45:06,960
also check in their procurement whether

1231
00:45:06,960 --> 00:45:07,680
they

1232
00:45:07,680 --> 00:45:09,119
they ask for that whether there are some

1233
00:45:09,119 --> 00:45:11,520
guarantees whether this is

1234
00:45:11,520 --> 00:45:14,240
where the vendors the manufacturers have

1235
00:45:14,240 --> 00:45:15,440
to argue yes

1236
00:45:15,440 --> 00:45:17,520
they they did it they considered the

1237
00:45:17,520 --> 00:45:20,000
principles they have some way of

1238
00:45:20,000 --> 00:45:23,040
developing so if it's ignored then of

1239
00:45:23,040 --> 00:45:24,319
course

1240
00:45:24,319 --> 00:45:26,319
nothing happens but this is something

1241
00:45:26,319 --> 00:45:28,319
where we have some procedural ways to

1242
00:45:28,319 --> 00:45:29,440
answer

1243
00:45:29,440 --> 00:45:31,680
our investigations currently already

1244
00:45:31,680 --> 00:45:33,680
well driven by so many individual

1245
00:45:33,680 --> 00:45:35,920
complaints that the structural

1246
00:45:35,920 --> 00:45:39,200
problems can only be applied if they're

1247
00:45:39,200 --> 00:45:40,400
mandatory

1248
00:45:40,400 --> 00:45:42,800
uh investigations for example the police

1249
00:45:42,800 --> 00:45:45,040
sector where we have extra personal for

1250
00:45:45,040 --> 00:45:48,160
of staff for that or if there are very

1251
00:45:48,160 --> 00:45:51,440
interesting complaints and there's a 101

1252
00:45:51,440 --> 00:45:52,640
is 101

1253
00:45:52,640 --> 00:45:54,960
complaints by max schemes so this is

1254
00:45:54,960 --> 00:45:56,400
something where we see also

1255
00:45:56,400 --> 00:46:00,560
structural relevance and where

1256
00:46:00,560 --> 00:46:02,560
the indeed some individuals have

1257
00:46:02,560 --> 00:46:04,079
complaints that are very much of

1258
00:46:04,079 --> 00:46:04,800
structural

1259
00:46:04,800 --> 00:46:08,480
relevance but this is their well they're

1260
00:46:08,480 --> 00:46:12,800
they're outliers the decisions

1261
00:46:12,800 --> 00:46:14,880
especially those decisions with big

1262
00:46:14,880 --> 00:46:16,480
players concerning big players

1263
00:46:16,480 --> 00:46:19,440
they are always legally challenged and

1264
00:46:19,440 --> 00:46:20,800
it can cost us

1265
00:46:20,800 --> 00:46:23,359
years it slows down compliance and also

1266
00:46:23,359 --> 00:46:24,640
it demotivates

1267
00:46:24,640 --> 00:46:28,160
everybody involved well at least us

1268
00:46:28,160 --> 00:46:30,560
at least also those role models the

1269
00:46:30,560 --> 00:46:31,440
other the

1270
00:46:31,440 --> 00:46:35,119
smes for example who try to make it

1271
00:46:35,119 --> 00:46:37,200
right who are investing in data

1272
00:46:37,200 --> 00:46:38,480
protection compliance

1273
00:46:38,480 --> 00:46:41,520
and see that especially big players

1274
00:46:41,520 --> 00:46:44,640
are so much so hard to to grab and it

1275
00:46:44,640 --> 00:46:45,440
takes years

1276
00:46:45,440 --> 00:46:49,760
to have all the court uh rulings

1277
00:46:49,760 --> 00:46:51,920
we won't give up but still this is

1278
00:46:51,920 --> 00:46:53,920
really a problem also in motivation

1279
00:46:53,920 --> 00:46:55,839
and motivating people and also it's a

1280
00:46:55,839 --> 00:46:57,200
problem that there are so many

1281
00:46:57,200 --> 00:46:59,280
exceptions for the public sector

1282
00:46:59,280 --> 00:47:02,240
we also discuss it very much but still

1283
00:47:02,240 --> 00:47:02,800
um

1284
00:47:02,800 --> 00:47:06,160
it may be that well there are some ways

1285
00:47:06,160 --> 00:47:07,359
of

1286
00:47:07,359 --> 00:47:11,920
surveillance tools of some ideas of

1287
00:47:11,920 --> 00:47:15,280
beginning encryption um where it's so

1288
00:47:15,280 --> 00:47:16,800
hard for dpas

1289
00:47:16,800 --> 00:47:18,800
to do something because there's then a

1290
00:47:18,800 --> 00:47:20,079
law that

1291
00:47:20,079 --> 00:47:22,720
allows this kind of processing so the

1292
00:47:22,720 --> 00:47:24,640
law has to be legally challenged and

1293
00:47:24,640 --> 00:47:25,359
this is

1294
00:47:25,359 --> 00:47:28,160
nothing we can do so we have no right as

1295
00:47:28,160 --> 00:47:29,119
a dpa

1296
00:47:29,119 --> 00:47:31,440
to challenge a law we have to apply the

1297
00:47:31,440 --> 00:47:32,160
law

1298
00:47:32,160 --> 00:47:34,000
and this means there are also some

1299
00:47:34,000 --> 00:47:35,760
individuals that we going before a

1300
00:47:35,760 --> 00:47:37,359
constitutional court so this is

1301
00:47:37,359 --> 00:47:38,079
happening

1302
00:47:38,079 --> 00:47:41,200
but it means again that the civil

1303
00:47:41,200 --> 00:47:43,920
society has to take action and in

1304
00:47:43,920 --> 00:47:45,359
principle i think the

1305
00:47:45,359 --> 00:47:48,240
public sector should be role model and

1306
00:47:48,240 --> 00:47:51,040
there must not be exemptions

1307
00:47:51,040 --> 00:47:52,640
one thing with which i also when i

1308
00:47:52,640 --> 00:47:54,880
listen to the talks uh the gdpr

1309
00:47:54,880 --> 00:47:57,680
assumes always clear responsibilities

1310
00:47:57,680 --> 00:47:58,160
and

1311
00:47:58,160 --> 00:48:01,440
organizations but very many of the

1312
00:48:01,440 --> 00:48:03,839
solutions meanwhile have to have to do

1313
00:48:03,839 --> 00:48:06,240
with crowd activities by users

1314
00:48:06,240 --> 00:48:10,000
so people who who

1315
00:48:10,000 --> 00:48:12,640
are part of the processing and not the

1316
00:48:12,640 --> 00:48:14,480
the main not a central

1317
00:48:14,480 --> 00:48:16,720
organization and especially with

1318
00:48:16,720 --> 00:48:17,920
unlinkability

1319
00:48:17,920 --> 00:48:21,760
and some accommodation tools this is

1320
00:48:21,760 --> 00:48:24,079
i think a right way to go but it's

1321
00:48:24,079 --> 00:48:25,760
sometimes very difficult

1322
00:48:25,760 --> 00:48:28,800
then to have a legally

1323
00:48:28,800 --> 00:48:32,319
clarity illegal clarity there and

1324
00:48:32,319 --> 00:48:36,480
also to find out what is now the fair

1325
00:48:36,480 --> 00:48:39,599
way of of processing but um this is

1326
00:48:39,599 --> 00:48:40,960
probably something where we can have

1327
00:48:40,960 --> 00:48:42,880
another target some other

1328
00:48:42,880 --> 00:48:44,400
time and i want to learn from you as

1329
00:48:44,400 --> 00:48:47,040
well your work on risk is important so

1330
00:48:47,040 --> 00:48:48,000
not only you work

1331
00:48:48,000 --> 00:48:50,480
on development projects something where

1332
00:48:50,480 --> 00:48:52,720
we see that the idea is not only on the

1333
00:48:52,720 --> 00:48:53,839
idea level but

1334
00:48:53,839 --> 00:48:56,160
can be put into reality also you work on

1335
00:48:56,160 --> 00:48:57,680
risks because the

1336
00:48:57,680 --> 00:49:01,440
risks that are related with other

1337
00:49:01,440 --> 00:49:04,160
people perhaps with the market solutions

1338
00:49:04,160 --> 00:49:04,559
this

1339
00:49:04,559 --> 00:49:06,720
is something where we can also have a

1340
00:49:06,720 --> 00:49:07,839
leverage where we can

1341
00:49:07,839 --> 00:49:11,680
use that and say well but you have you

1342
00:49:11,680 --> 00:49:13,520
big vendors and manufacturers you have

1343
00:49:13,520 --> 00:49:15,680
to to solve that otherwise it's too

1344
00:49:15,680 --> 00:49:17,920
risky it does not solve

1345
00:49:17,920 --> 00:49:20,960
our problems it's not compliant

1346
00:49:20,960 --> 00:49:23,520
so perfect is the enemy of good uh what

1347
00:49:23,520 --> 00:49:25,200
does it mean now for researchers

1348
00:49:25,200 --> 00:49:28,079
and dpas it's not an either or a strive

1349
00:49:28,079 --> 00:49:29,359
for the better yes

1350
00:49:29,359 --> 00:49:31,119
publish communicate advance the

1351
00:49:31,119 --> 00:49:32,960
state-of-the-art don't give up on

1352
00:49:32,960 --> 00:49:36,240
being better but also if you

1353
00:49:36,240 --> 00:49:38,480
think we need only good enough and the

1354
00:49:38,480 --> 00:49:39,839
dpas have to

1355
00:49:39,839 --> 00:49:42,559
stop when it's good enough even then

1356
00:49:42,559 --> 00:49:44,000
publish and communicate

1357
00:49:44,000 --> 00:49:46,960
and go ahead with what about the risks

1358
00:49:46,960 --> 00:49:47,680
and what about

1359
00:49:47,680 --> 00:49:50,720
open questions also that sometimes

1360
00:49:50,720 --> 00:49:53,760
and this is how research works um that

1361
00:49:53,760 --> 00:49:55,200
this is now something

1362
00:49:55,200 --> 00:49:58,000
where dpas also should listen and at

1363
00:49:58,000 --> 00:49:59,599
least i will listen

1364
00:49:59,599 --> 00:50:02,400
and it's easier for us to listen to the

1365
00:50:02,400 --> 00:50:04,400
research community than to

1366
00:50:04,400 --> 00:50:07,839
those who are asking us almost every day

1367
00:50:07,839 --> 00:50:10,640
from the company side saying oh we want

1368
00:50:10,640 --> 00:50:12,240
you to improve

1369
00:50:12,240 --> 00:50:15,040
our system of course very often they

1370
00:50:15,040 --> 00:50:16,160
without any cause

1371
00:50:16,160 --> 00:50:19,200
but i think research neutral

1372
00:50:19,200 --> 00:50:22,720
checkable auditable research findings

1373
00:50:22,720 --> 00:50:25,680
and how to communicate that to people

1374
00:50:25,680 --> 00:50:26,480
such as me

1375
00:50:26,480 --> 00:50:28,960
or those who are not computer scientists

1376
00:50:28,960 --> 00:50:29,760
in the pet

1377
00:50:29,760 --> 00:50:32,720
community this is something where we

1378
00:50:32,720 --> 00:50:33,520
should also

1379
00:50:33,520 --> 00:50:36,559
go ahead perhaps together as

1380
00:50:36,559 --> 00:50:39,280
having a joint task bridging this gap

1381
00:50:39,280 --> 00:50:40,800
which is quite huge

1382
00:50:40,800 --> 00:50:45,520
in a very and perhaps the most important

1383
00:50:45,520 --> 00:50:49,200
digital a problem to have fair data

1384
00:50:49,200 --> 00:50:50,000
processing

1385
00:50:50,000 --> 00:50:55,839
also in the next very much

1386
00:50:56,559 --> 00:50:58,640
thank you so much for that a real

1387
00:50:58,640 --> 00:51:00,079
whirlwind talk through

1388
00:51:00,079 --> 00:51:03,200
so many areas of data protection law

1389
00:51:03,200 --> 00:51:03,839
practice

1390
00:51:03,839 --> 00:51:05,839
and the link between technologies we'll

1391
00:51:05,839 --> 00:51:09,599
go straight to questions
