00:00:00,609 --> 00:00:05,890
hi my name is matt deezie and welcome to

2
00:00:03,519 --> 00:00:08,379
my presentation about my recent work

3
00:00:05,890 --> 00:00:11,559
caused by car steering rebuilds your

4
00:00:08,380 --> 00:00:13,230
trip route have been getting

5
00:00:11,559 --> 00:00:15,849
increasingly connected in recent years

6
00:00:13,230 --> 00:00:19,210
the data connectivity that means

7
00:00:15,849 --> 00:00:24,849
vehicles equipped with some sort of LTE

8
00:00:19,210 --> 00:00:28,119
or 5g were standing at 20% and 2016-2020

9
00:00:24,849 --> 00:00:30,250
has jumped to 75% and by next year is

10
00:00:28,119 --> 00:00:32,019
expected that 98 percent of all new

11
00:00:30,250 --> 00:00:34,030
vehicles sold in North America and

12
00:00:32,020 --> 00:00:36,400
Europe are going to equipped with the

13
00:00:34,030 --> 00:00:38,500
data function with this increasing of

14
00:00:36,400 --> 00:00:42,010
connectivity this will also open the

15
00:00:38,500 --> 00:00:45,160
doors for car manufacturers or EMS to

16
00:00:42,010 --> 00:00:47,220
make revenue out of it this can be done

17
00:00:45,160 --> 00:00:50,379
in two ways they can sell the data to

18
00:00:47,220 --> 00:00:53,110
advertise advertisers or they can

19
00:00:50,380 --> 00:00:57,820
implement app store and share the data

20
00:00:53,110 --> 00:01:00,070
with interested third party apps in

21
00:00:57,820 --> 00:01:03,130
order to understand the this work we

22
00:01:00,070 --> 00:01:05,470
need to first start and discuss who

23
00:01:03,130 --> 00:01:07,210
collects beekler data and what be clear

24
00:01:05,470 --> 00:01:10,450
data they collect so let's start with

25
00:01:07,210 --> 00:01:13,479
who collects the data this these can be

26
00:01:10,450 --> 00:01:16,600
native platforms like native OEM

27
00:01:13,480 --> 00:01:19,090
platforms like BMW car data or Mercedes

28
00:01:16,600 --> 00:01:21,309
there's other companies like usage based

29
00:01:19,090 --> 00:01:23,140
insurance progressive State Farm and

30
00:01:21,310 --> 00:01:25,510
other companies that collect Buehler

31
00:01:23,140 --> 00:01:28,720
data and new in the game is Android

32
00:01:25,510 --> 00:01:31,600
automotive which is a native built in

33
00:01:28,720 --> 00:01:33,550
Android operating system inside the

34
00:01:31,600 --> 00:01:37,570
vehicle it's runs on an infotainment

35
00:01:33,550 --> 00:01:40,390
unit and what data can be collected

36
00:01:37,570 --> 00:01:41,919
there is a myriad of sensor data and

37
00:01:40,390 --> 00:01:44,800
other information that can be collected

38
00:01:41,920 --> 00:01:46,750
from vehicles it can range from poetry

39
00:01:44,800 --> 00:01:49,780
and related information such as vehicle

40
00:01:46,750 --> 00:01:51,640
speed or torque or steering wheel angle

41
00:01:49,780 --> 00:01:54,040
to body related information like

42
00:01:51,640 --> 00:01:57,610
seatbelt status or airbag status and

43
00:01:54,040 --> 00:01:59,560
many more and now we have to ask

44
00:01:57,610 --> 00:02:02,200
ourselves the question how is this data

45
00:01:59,560 --> 00:02:04,060
collected and in order to do that we are

46
00:02:02,200 --> 00:02:08,110
going to look at an example that's been

47
00:02:04,060 --> 00:02:11,020
derived from BMW car data so we have our

48
00:02:08,110 --> 00:02:14,530
third-party application provider Mallory

49
00:02:11,020 --> 00:02:17,680
and she offers a third-party app

50
00:02:14,530 --> 00:02:20,520
and Ellis is the customer office OEM and

51
00:02:17,680 --> 00:02:23,170
and she wants to install Valerie's

52
00:02:20,520 --> 00:02:25,480
third-party app from the OEMs app store

53
00:02:23,170 --> 00:02:28,420
and just like in mobile operating

54
00:02:25,480 --> 00:02:30,190
systems you will see a pop-up dialog

55
00:02:28,420 --> 00:02:32,559
these are the permissions that this app

56
00:02:30,190 --> 00:02:35,020
requires are you okay with it or not

57
00:02:32,560 --> 00:02:36,970
are you going to authorize it and if

58
00:02:35,020 --> 00:02:38,459
Ellis decides to authorize the app the

59
00:02:36,970 --> 00:02:41,830
data first will be transferred to

60
00:02:38,459 --> 00:02:44,800
back-end of the OEM and then the OEM

61
00:02:41,830 --> 00:02:48,130
will share a copy of this data for

62
00:02:44,800 --> 00:02:50,500
further processing to a third-party

63
00:02:48,130 --> 00:02:52,750
server over the OEMs business business

64
00:02:50,500 --> 00:02:54,580
in your face and we can already see like

65
00:02:52,750 --> 00:02:56,410
a huge problem here the data will be

66
00:02:54,580 --> 00:02:58,209
done in the hands of a third party and

67
00:02:56,410 --> 00:02:59,920
if the third parties malicious they can

68
00:02:58,209 --> 00:03:03,580
do whatever they want for the data once

69
00:02:59,920 --> 00:03:05,109
they have and as we can see the

70
00:03:03,580 --> 00:03:07,510
increased connectivity does come at a

71
00:03:05,110 --> 00:03:09,970
price so it opens doors for data

72
00:03:07,510 --> 00:03:13,019
monetization but it also opens the doors

73
00:03:09,970 --> 00:03:16,359
for privacy issues privacy concerns and

74
00:03:13,019 --> 00:03:18,489
the recent years these are unfortunately

75
00:03:16,360 --> 00:03:21,370
also on the rise like Facebook Cambridge

76
00:03:18,489 --> 00:03:23,320
analytic incident and the repeat

77
00:03:21,370 --> 00:03:25,920
European Union deciding to implement

78
00:03:23,320 --> 00:03:29,500
privacy protection laws called gdpr and

79
00:03:25,920 --> 00:03:31,929
the question now is of course we have

80
00:03:29,500 --> 00:03:33,610
more regulation and people are more

81
00:03:31,930 --> 00:03:35,530
aware of privacy in recent years but

82
00:03:33,610 --> 00:03:39,420
does this also apply to the Vic Euler

83
00:03:35,530 --> 00:03:43,180
context of the v/q learn ecosystem and

84
00:03:39,420 --> 00:03:44,768
are talking about the first part do we

85
00:03:43,180 --> 00:03:48,900
have more regulation in the VQ learner

86
00:03:44,769 --> 00:03:51,640
context GPR is fairly new and these

87
00:03:48,900 --> 00:03:54,489
novel data collection systems and cars

88
00:03:51,640 --> 00:03:56,170
telematic platforms are also very very

89
00:03:54,489 --> 00:03:59,380
new and they're just about it starts

90
00:03:56,170 --> 00:04:01,268
getting implemented in cars so there's

91
00:03:59,380 --> 00:04:03,810
not a lot of GDP our research on that

92
00:04:01,269 --> 00:04:07,180
unfortunately the only existing

93
00:04:03,810 --> 00:04:08,530
regulation documents by the time of the

94
00:04:07,180 --> 00:04:10,720
writing of this paper were some

95
00:04:08,530 --> 00:04:16,019
voluntary guidelines that were written

96
00:04:10,720 --> 00:04:20,228
in 2014 so none binding for OMS and

97
00:04:16,019 --> 00:04:22,810
besides other things OMS these documents

98
00:04:20,228 --> 00:04:25,450
stated that we only have to ask explicit

99
00:04:22,810 --> 00:04:28,120
constant for three categories of data

100
00:04:25,450 --> 00:04:30,010
which they define is driving behavior so

101
00:04:28,120 --> 00:04:32,470
is basically information about how a

102
00:04:30,010 --> 00:04:34,570
person drives a vehicle from critics

103
00:04:32,470 --> 00:04:37,120
examples of this data in this document

104
00:04:34,570 --> 00:04:39,210
are vehicle speed seat belt use and

105
00:04:37,120 --> 00:04:42,160
information about breaking habits

106
00:04:39,210 --> 00:04:45,989
geolocation and finally biometrics which

107
00:04:42,160 --> 00:04:45,990
Lee summarizes covered information

108
00:04:46,900 --> 00:04:54,280
so much regulation and whole lot P

109
00:04:50,090 --> 00:04:58,039
awareness in order to to assess the

110
00:04:54,280 --> 00:05:00,378
sentiment of part of custom of potential

111
00:04:58,039 --> 00:05:03,020
customers towards how sensitive Eclair

112
00:05:00,379 --> 00:05:05,210
data is conducted a survey and we ask

113
00:05:03,020 --> 00:05:06,530
them to very similar sounding questions

114
00:05:05,210 --> 00:05:09,198
how much do you agree to share the

115
00:05:06,530 --> 00:05:11,448
following data types with no am and will

116
00:05:09,199 --> 00:05:13,909
a third-party app provider and we also

117
00:05:11,449 --> 00:05:17,090
give them some examples about what these

118
00:05:13,909 --> 00:05:19,909
volumes and that providers could be so

119
00:05:17,090 --> 00:05:22,549
we use 20 data types and we introduced

120
00:05:19,909 --> 00:05:25,900
the five-point Likert scale ranging from

121
00:05:22,550 --> 00:05:30,490
strongly disagree to strongly agree and

122
00:05:25,900 --> 00:05:33,258
this is an overview of our setup so we

123
00:05:30,490 --> 00:05:34,970
recruited 100 participants from Amazon

124
00:05:33,259 --> 00:05:37,310
Mechanical Turk you can see some

125
00:05:34,970 --> 00:05:41,690
demographic information on slight and

126
00:05:37,310 --> 00:05:44,620
these are the results basically we can

127
00:05:41,690 --> 00:05:47,870
see that these are very sensitive

128
00:05:44,620 --> 00:05:50,030
sensors from the vehicle like location

129
00:05:47,870 --> 00:05:53,389
or speed whereas others like temperature

130
00:05:50,030 --> 00:05:59,989
make model year here are not super

131
00:05:53,389 --> 00:06:02,990
sensitive and from these results this is

132
00:05:59,990 --> 00:06:05,199
an ever result from both the answers to

133
00:06:02,990 --> 00:06:08,599
the OEM and the third-party but we can

134
00:06:05,199 --> 00:06:11,270
say from from what we've seen that the

135
00:06:08,599 --> 00:06:13,150
mean for the OEM is a bit higher than

136
00:06:11,270 --> 00:06:15,909
for the third-party which means that

137
00:06:13,150 --> 00:06:18,919
customers or the participants trust

138
00:06:15,909 --> 00:06:23,300
native om apps but more than third-party

139
00:06:18,919 --> 00:06:24,740
apps one particular sensor is this one

140
00:06:23,300 --> 00:06:26,960
that I indicated with a different

141
00:06:24,740 --> 00:06:28,729
indicator here as a steering Lionel and

142
00:06:26,960 --> 00:06:30,830
this is what we're going to be looking

143
00:06:28,729 --> 00:06:33,349
at during the rest of the presentation

144
00:06:30,830 --> 00:06:35,270
and we can see that the steering angle

145
00:06:33,349 --> 00:06:37,219
is pretty much in the middle so it's got

146
00:06:35,270 --> 00:06:39,349
an average response people are not super

147
00:06:37,219 --> 00:06:43,370
sensitive about it but they're also not

148
00:06:39,349 --> 00:06:45,529
reluctant about it and this is exactly

149
00:06:43,370 --> 00:06:47,870
what we're going to exploit and this

150
00:06:45,529 --> 00:06:50,419
work and the problem statement we can

151
00:06:47,870 --> 00:06:52,729
say that we want to infer the drivers

152
00:06:50,419 --> 00:06:55,279
location from the steering wheel angle

153
00:06:52,729 --> 00:06:57,169
and this is much more liable possibly

154
00:06:55,279 --> 00:07:00,310
than using a speed as you can see

155
00:06:57,169 --> 00:07:02,960
because the speed is much more sensitive

156
00:07:00,310 --> 00:07:04,340
relates us to why this attack is

157
00:07:02,960 --> 00:07:06,049
actually feasible it's not only the

158
00:07:04,340 --> 00:07:09,770
survey that we saw it's actually three

159
00:07:06,050 --> 00:07:11,690
reasons that contribute to this first of

160
00:07:09,770 --> 00:07:13,849
all it's the weak architecture design as

161
00:07:11,690 --> 00:07:15,830
we saw in the threat model the

162
00:07:13,849 --> 00:07:17,599
permission model can be very

163
00:07:15,830 --> 00:07:19,280
coarse-grained like people like

164
00:07:17,599 --> 00:07:22,490
researchers showed in Android automotive

165
00:07:19,280 --> 00:07:24,919
case and for the OEMs the review process

166
00:07:22,490 --> 00:07:27,560
is not standardized and it does not have

167
00:07:24,919 --> 00:07:30,469
to be very strict especially with the

168
00:07:27,560 --> 00:07:31,129
rising number of third-party apps for

169
00:07:30,470 --> 00:07:33,139
the more Lexx

170
00:07:31,129 --> 00:07:35,629
privacy regulations as we saw there's

171
00:07:33,139 --> 00:07:38,240
only some voluntary guidelines with some

172
00:07:35,629 --> 00:07:40,490
big recommendations and nobody really

173
00:07:38,240 --> 00:07:41,500
knows how to apply gdpr yet to this

174
00:07:40,490 --> 00:07:43,879
context

175
00:07:41,500 --> 00:07:46,009
finally the lacking user awareness and

176
00:07:43,879 --> 00:07:47,780
the survey basically showed very well

177
00:07:46,009 --> 00:07:50,690
that the steering wheel angle is not

178
00:07:47,780 --> 00:07:53,780
very sensitive enough stirrup sensor and

179
00:07:50,690 --> 00:07:56,479
all these three reasons contributes to

180
00:07:53,780 --> 00:07:59,960
this privacy attack that we're going to

181
00:07:56,479 --> 00:08:02,060
conduct the location inference or travel

182
00:07:59,960 --> 00:08:04,909
route reconstruction through steering

183
00:08:02,060 --> 00:08:08,300
wheel angle is extremely tempting and

184
00:08:04,909 --> 00:08:10,310
we're going to do this by introducing a

185
00:08:08,300 --> 00:08:12,199
novel technique called Rock Yuma which

186
00:08:10,310 --> 00:08:14,419
stands for road curvature matching and

187
00:08:12,199 --> 00:08:18,319
this is pretty much explained and the

188
00:08:14,419 --> 00:08:21,650
figure here the blue trace is a steering

189
00:08:18,319 --> 00:08:23,810
Langille well the orange trace is the

190
00:08:21,650 --> 00:08:25,880
road curvature as you can see they're

191
00:08:23,810 --> 00:08:29,479
highly correlated with each other in

192
00:08:25,880 --> 00:08:31,340
this case 0.93 an assumption we have to

193
00:08:29,479 --> 00:08:34,370
make in order to for ocular to work is

194
00:08:31,340 --> 00:08:36,559
that we have to know the roughly the

195
00:08:34,370 --> 00:08:37,909
geographical area we're conducting it so

196
00:08:36,559 --> 00:08:41,929
we need to know where the victim lives

197
00:08:37,909 --> 00:08:43,549
like in what city for example and this

198
00:08:41,929 --> 00:08:45,319
leads to our system designs so as and

199
00:08:43,549 --> 00:08:47,540
what we have the victim's steering wheel

200
00:08:45,320 --> 00:08:49,970
angle trace set got collected by these

201
00:08:47,540 --> 00:08:53,390
telematics platforms and we are also

202
00:08:49,970 --> 00:08:55,399
going to have a ground truth data based

203
00:08:53,390 --> 00:08:57,740
off road curvatures that we can drive

204
00:08:55,399 --> 00:09:00,410
very easily through publicly available

205
00:08:57,740 --> 00:09:02,959
map API is like Google Maps or open

206
00:09:00,410 --> 00:09:05,569
street maps which we're using and the

207
00:09:02,959 --> 00:09:08,510
experimental study of this work so this

208
00:09:05,570 --> 00:09:11,390
is one wrote and in our burn michigan

209
00:09:08,510 --> 00:09:13,290
and the red dots indicate intersections

210
00:09:11,390 --> 00:09:15,899
so where the driver can turn right

211
00:09:13,290 --> 00:09:17,910
left and the road portion between two of

212
00:09:15,899 --> 00:09:20,579
these red dots we're going to refer to

213
00:09:17,910 --> 00:09:25,589
that as Road segments and the following

214
00:09:20,579 --> 00:09:27,120
and the repairs are calculated for each

215
00:09:25,589 --> 00:09:31,529
of these Road segments and stored in a

216
00:09:27,120 --> 00:09:33,839
database then we're going then the the

217
00:09:31,529 --> 00:09:35,550
attacker is going to take the victims

218
00:09:33,839 --> 00:09:37,380
steering wheel steering wheel angle

219
00:09:35,550 --> 00:09:39,689
trace since the victim is not only going

220
00:09:37,380 --> 00:09:41,819
to go only on one road for their entire

221
00:09:39,690 --> 00:09:44,639
trip but turn at some point we have to

222
00:09:41,819 --> 00:09:47,279
split it into different unique sections

223
00:09:44,639 --> 00:09:51,060
and determine where it turns are like

224
00:09:47,279 --> 00:09:52,529
left turns right turns and u-turns after

225
00:09:51,060 --> 00:09:54,930
we have that after we split the entire

226
00:09:52,529 --> 00:09:56,430
trace into different sections we're

227
00:09:54,930 --> 00:09:57,750
going to calc for each of these sections

228
00:09:56,430 --> 00:09:59,758
we're going to calculate the road

229
00:09:57,750 --> 00:10:01,440
curvature and we're going to explore the

230
00:09:59,759 --> 00:10:03,240
correlation we're going to train a

231
00:10:01,440 --> 00:10:05,940
linear regression model with some

232
00:10:03,240 --> 00:10:08,579
training data that we have and then we

233
00:10:05,940 --> 00:10:13,589
will know how to calculate the road

234
00:10:08,579 --> 00:10:17,550
curvature for the attack data next we

235
00:10:13,589 --> 00:10:19,740
have to start can start matching the

236
00:10:17,550 --> 00:10:21,510
calculated road curvature with the

237
00:10:19,740 --> 00:10:23,490
derived road curvature from our run

238
00:10:21,510 --> 00:10:26,519
throughs database and we got to start

239
00:10:23,490 --> 00:10:29,459
with one section you define the salience

240
00:10:26,519 --> 00:10:31,500
action which is the initial section has

241
00:10:29,459 --> 00:10:34,739
the one with the average for the highest

242
00:10:31,500 --> 00:10:37,110
average curvature in that area which is

243
00:10:34,740 --> 00:10:39,870
basically depicted here and with a red

244
00:10:37,110 --> 00:10:43,980
circle so we're going to start matching

245
00:10:39,870 --> 00:10:45,480
this and a section is basically just

246
00:10:43,980 --> 00:10:50,940
nothing else in one road without any

247
00:10:45,480 --> 00:10:55,589
turnings and we're going to calculate

248
00:10:50,940 --> 00:10:59,130
the dynamic time warping score the dtw

249
00:10:55,589 --> 00:11:01,110
score for each of for each road segment

250
00:10:59,130 --> 00:11:03,930
individually and for combinations of it

251
00:11:01,110 --> 00:11:06,779
so in order to depict this we have a

252
00:11:03,930 --> 00:11:11,189
very easy example here with only five

253
00:11:06,779 --> 00:11:13,860
Road segments and we will have we will

254
00:11:11,189 --> 00:11:16,019
go through the entire search space of

255
00:11:13,860 --> 00:11:19,620
all the Road segments possible and then

256
00:11:16,019 --> 00:11:22,319
start matching the calculated road

257
00:11:19,620 --> 00:11:24,750
curvature for that section with first

258
00:11:22,319 --> 00:11:27,130
the first road segment so this would be

259
00:11:24,750 --> 00:11:29,590
in our case B this

260
00:11:27,130 --> 00:11:31,480
and then we're going to do it with a

261
00:11:29,590 --> 00:11:33,700
second the third segment the fourth

262
00:11:31,480 --> 00:11:36,700
segment of the fifth segment of course

263
00:11:33,700 --> 00:11:38,290
the driver is not going to turn at every

264
00:11:36,700 --> 00:11:41,350
intersection so we also have to consider

265
00:11:38,290 --> 00:11:44,709
it as I've said combinations of Road

266
00:11:41,350 --> 00:11:48,310
segments so because combinations of two

267
00:11:44,710 --> 00:11:51,280
and then we will look at three and so on

268
00:11:48,310 --> 00:11:53,140
you get the gist and then we will mix

269
00:11:51,280 --> 00:11:57,459
the remaining sections which is much

270
00:11:53,140 --> 00:12:00,640
easier since we already know where where

271
00:11:57,460 --> 00:12:02,520
the salience section starts and ends so

272
00:12:00,640 --> 00:12:05,650
we only have like a limited amount of

273
00:12:02,520 --> 00:12:07,810
possibilities to go through so this is a

274
00:12:05,650 --> 00:12:09,819
salient section and what we're going to

275
00:12:07,810 --> 00:12:14,040
do is we're going to match the preceding

276
00:12:09,820 --> 00:12:17,050
and succeeding section so these two and

277
00:12:14,040 --> 00:12:19,270
this goes on recursively until the

278
00:12:17,050 --> 00:12:22,329
entire traces process and then this ends

279
00:12:19,270 --> 00:12:23,740
and we will have the met route one thing

280
00:12:22,330 --> 00:12:25,240
I want to mention is that we have to

281
00:12:23,740 --> 00:12:27,160
have that we have to manually

282
00:12:25,240 --> 00:12:29,500
pre-process the steering wheel angle

283
00:12:27,160 --> 00:12:31,120
trace from the victim first by cutting

284
00:12:29,500 --> 00:12:33,640
the first couple seconds in the last

285
00:12:31,120 --> 00:12:35,770
couple seconds and this was because

286
00:12:33,640 --> 00:12:37,930
usually when the victim starts a trip

287
00:12:35,770 --> 00:12:41,020
they back out of the cryo way or they

288
00:12:37,930 --> 00:12:43,739
drive into a parking lot when they end

289
00:12:41,020 --> 00:12:45,790
their trip and this messes up with

290
00:12:43,740 --> 00:12:49,150
rakhumai and that's the reason we had to

291
00:12:45,790 --> 00:12:51,010
manually process it and cut it out so

292
00:12:49,150 --> 00:12:54,310
for experimental setup we used five

293
00:12:51,010 --> 00:12:57,040
different vehicles from the same OEM

294
00:12:54,310 --> 00:12:59,770
fort we collected 50 it traces a total

295
00:12:57,040 --> 00:13:01,719
by using the opening c platform which

296
00:12:59,770 --> 00:13:04,780
gave us access to a steering wheel angle

297
00:13:01,720 --> 00:13:06,850
parameter in these ford vehicles and for

298
00:13:04,780 --> 00:13:09,990
the road curvature we use OpenStreetMap

299
00:13:06,850 --> 00:13:12,930
api to derive

300
00:13:09,990 --> 00:13:16,320
here in the data set you can see some

301
00:13:12,930 --> 00:13:17,939
statistics about the 58 races so we

302
00:13:16,320 --> 00:13:19,649
couldn't ducted all our experiments in

303
00:13:17,940 --> 00:13:22,620
the city of Ann Arbor Michigan which

304
00:13:19,649 --> 00:13:26,160
consists of 236 roads and a little bit

305
00:13:22,620 --> 00:13:28,800
more about 2700 Road segments the

306
00:13:26,160 --> 00:13:32,519
maximum trip length was 20 miles and the

307
00:13:28,800 --> 00:13:36,510
average was around 4 months the most

308
00:13:32,519 --> 00:13:41,220
important thing is accuracy how did the

309
00:13:36,510 --> 00:13:43,170
rock Yuma do and in 41 out of 58 cases

310
00:13:41,220 --> 00:13:45,360
we could match the entire route from

311
00:13:43,170 --> 00:13:48,240
start to end which accounts 71 percent

312
00:13:45,360 --> 00:13:50,310
accuracy and we also wanted to see if it

313
00:13:48,240 --> 00:13:52,860
really depends on if it's a short trip

314
00:13:50,310 --> 00:13:55,140
or a long trip and we saw pretty much

315
00:13:52,860 --> 00:13:57,779
that it's independent of the attacked

316
00:13:55,140 --> 00:14:01,769
race line which is very good we also

317
00:13:57,779 --> 00:14:03,209
wanted to look at how it behaves just

318
00:14:01,769 --> 00:14:05,519
matching the initial section because

319
00:14:03,209 --> 00:14:08,579
we're doing this on the entire search

320
00:14:05,519 --> 00:14:11,300
space and in 44 cases we could match it

321
00:14:08,579 --> 00:14:14,420
so this means that only three cases

322
00:14:11,300 --> 00:14:16,469
after matching the initial section

323
00:14:14,420 --> 00:14:19,019
recommended could not match the

324
00:14:16,470 --> 00:14:21,180
remaining sections with a smaller search

325
00:14:19,019 --> 00:14:23,490
space and we wanted to explore and

326
00:14:21,180 --> 00:14:24,959
explain why this happened and this is

327
00:14:23,490 --> 00:14:29,670
basically the reason for all of these

328
00:14:24,959 --> 00:14:31,739
cases so it had to it had to find this

329
00:14:29,670 --> 00:14:36,660
correct intersection but it found the

330
00:14:31,740 --> 00:14:39,199
preceding intersection and the reason is

331
00:14:36,660 --> 00:14:41,579
this last final road segment is

332
00:14:39,199 --> 00:14:43,680
relatively straight and not curvy and

333
00:14:41,579 --> 00:14:46,920
this is where Rock UML runs into travels

334
00:14:43,680 --> 00:14:48,750
so we can see here the lessons learned

335
00:14:46,920 --> 00:14:51,990
are that the success heavily depends on

336
00:14:48,750 --> 00:14:54,800
the initial section and the straight

337
00:14:51,990 --> 00:14:57,209
final segments can cause issues with

338
00:14:54,800 --> 00:15:01,769
other metrics that we benchmarked are

339
00:14:57,209 --> 00:15:04,500
the memory footprint so how big is it to

340
00:15:01,769 --> 00:15:07,110
store the entire ground truth road

341
00:15:04,500 --> 00:15:09,990
curvature database for Ann Arbor it was

342
00:15:07,110 --> 00:15:12,180
around 30 megabytes which was 55

343
00:15:09,990 --> 00:15:14,579
kilobytes per mile and if he

344
00:15:12,180 --> 00:15:15,599
extrapolated for the Detroit metro area

345
00:15:14,579 --> 00:15:17,819
which has more than 5 million

346
00:15:15,600 --> 00:15:19,470
inhabitants it's around twenty six

347
00:15:17,819 --> 00:15:22,020
gigabytes which is not a lot for an

348
00:15:19,470 --> 00:15:23,250
attacker and in terms of computation

349
00:15:22,020 --> 00:15:24,780
time we conducted our

350
00:15:23,250 --> 00:15:27,600
experiments are not fairly low and set

351
00:15:24,780 --> 00:15:30,930
up and we found out that the maximum

352
00:15:27,600 --> 00:15:34,710
time to process broke uma to class 19

353
00:15:30,930 --> 00:15:38,250
minutes and so most of it was for

354
00:15:34,710 --> 00:15:42,300
running DTW and initial section matching

355
00:15:38,250 --> 00:15:45,420
took more than 99% of the entire time

356
00:15:42,300 --> 00:15:46,979
so my question is how is are these

357
00:15:45,420 --> 00:15:49,079
experiments really applicable to other

358
00:15:46,980 --> 00:15:51,990
cities we only use one city to conduct

359
00:15:49,080 --> 00:15:54,780
our experiments and and we wanted to

360
00:15:51,990 --> 00:15:57,660
first start with a theoretical analysis

361
00:15:54,780 --> 00:16:00,810
and we looked at other cities from North

362
00:15:57,660 --> 00:16:02,250
America and Europe of flooring size

363
00:16:00,810 --> 00:16:04,469
which you can see in the number of road

364
00:16:02,250 --> 00:16:06,680
segments it has and we calculated the

365
00:16:04,470 --> 00:16:09,810
average curvature index which is

366
00:16:06,680 --> 00:16:13,140
basically the questions here below and

367
00:16:09,810 --> 00:16:16,790
it's basically saying how curvy is a

368
00:16:13,140 --> 00:16:19,439
road on average in the given city and

369
00:16:16,790 --> 00:16:21,150
some cities are lower that these are in

370
00:16:19,440 --> 00:16:23,220
depicted rat in some cities have a

371
00:16:21,150 --> 00:16:25,500
higher average curvature index which is

372
00:16:23,220 --> 00:16:27,630
in green which basically would

373
00:16:25,500 --> 00:16:29,820
theoretically mean that higher curvature

374
00:16:27,630 --> 00:16:32,790
index that it's more likely to work and

375
00:16:29,820 --> 00:16:35,900
the ones in rats not as likely but a

376
00:16:32,790 --> 00:16:39,599
second factor is the similarity of the

377
00:16:35,900 --> 00:16:42,720
road of the curviest roads in a city

378
00:16:39,600 --> 00:16:44,130
because again the bottleneck is

379
00:16:42,720 --> 00:16:45,990
measuring the initial section and we're

380
00:16:44,130 --> 00:16:49,950
going over the entire search space here

381
00:16:45,990 --> 00:16:52,080
and the more the last similar the

382
00:16:49,950 --> 00:16:54,570
pervious segments are the better is our

383
00:16:52,080 --> 00:16:57,960
chances to actually get the right the

384
00:16:54,570 --> 00:17:00,240
right segments and similarity can be

385
00:16:57,960 --> 00:17:02,100
expressed by the standard deviation

386
00:17:00,240 --> 00:17:04,440
Sigma of curve rebellious a larger of

387
00:17:02,100 --> 00:17:06,150
Sigma results for more distinct and less

388
00:17:04,440 --> 00:17:08,610
similar Road segments whereas a smaller

389
00:17:06,150 --> 00:17:11,400
Sigma represents more similar Road

390
00:17:08,609 --> 00:17:12,929
segments so we can see that although for

391
00:17:11,400 --> 00:17:16,110
San Francisco we have a lower average

392
00:17:12,930 --> 00:17:20,339
curvature in the next here we have less

393
00:17:16,109 --> 00:17:23,219
similar curviest segments which might

394
00:17:20,339 --> 00:17:26,310
actually imply that Brock Yuma could

395
00:17:23,220 --> 00:17:29,610
work in San Francisco you also want to

396
00:17:26,310 --> 00:17:31,530
quantify this and see given on the data

397
00:17:29,610 --> 00:17:33,510
we had if we could run some experiments

398
00:17:31,530 --> 00:17:35,670
and get some conclusions out of it and

399
00:17:33,510 --> 00:17:38,250
so what we did is we define a new area

400
00:17:35,670 --> 00:17:40,320
with a higher Kircher average cursor

401
00:17:38,250 --> 00:17:43,530
index in Ann Arbor which you can see in

402
00:17:40,320 --> 00:17:45,389
the rectangular red box and we ran 15

403
00:17:43,530 --> 00:17:47,670
traces out of these 50 entries and there

404
00:17:45,390 --> 00:17:52,470
because simply 15 traces started and

405
00:17:47,670 --> 00:17:55,170
ended in this area and the accuracy was

406
00:17:52,470 --> 00:17:55,590
surprisingly relative high it was in

407
00:17:55,170 --> 00:17:59,159
third

408
00:17:55,590 --> 00:18:01,529
fifteen cases we could match the route

409
00:17:59,159 --> 00:18:05,000
completely from start to end which is

410
00:18:01,529 --> 00:18:07,650
87% and although this is a very limited

411
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:09,840
evaluation we can say that an area with

412
00:18:07,650 --> 00:18:11,570
a higher average curvature can yield

413
00:18:09,840 --> 00:18:14,399
higher accuracy

414
00:18:11,570 --> 00:18:16,428
we want to compare our work with

415
00:18:14,400 --> 00:18:20,790
relating work there is some work on

416
00:18:16,429 --> 00:18:24,210
phone sensors that are being used to

417
00:18:20,790 --> 00:18:26,159
drive the location of a car phone ímu

418
00:18:24,210 --> 00:18:27,809
sensors or even the power consumption

419
00:18:26,160 --> 00:18:29,580
our leverage and then there's other

420
00:18:27,809 --> 00:18:33,420
works that actually use the vehicle

421
00:18:29,580 --> 00:18:36,149
speed from inside the car and one big

422
00:18:33,420 --> 00:18:40,260
difference of these of these works are

423
00:18:36,150 --> 00:18:42,210
that most of them assume a starting

424
00:18:40,260 --> 00:18:44,160
point which basically means they need to

425
00:18:42,210 --> 00:18:45,929
know the initial point where the car

426
00:18:44,160 --> 00:18:48,900
started driving and they can reconstruct

427
00:18:45,929 --> 00:18:51,420
the rest which is a very very big

428
00:18:48,900 --> 00:18:54,330
assumption to make and spy doesn't do

429
00:18:51,420 --> 00:18:56,520
that furthermore our accuracy if you

430
00:18:54,330 --> 00:18:59,250
look at the last row is much higher than

431
00:18:56,520 --> 00:19:03,210
all these related of course we have

432
00:18:59,250 --> 00:19:06,000
limitations we saw that or we think that

433
00:19:03,210 --> 00:19:07,350
for most European cities it will work

434
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:09,450
because they're usually curvier than

435
00:19:07,350 --> 00:19:12,480
American cities that are usually on the

436
00:19:09,450 --> 00:19:14,220
grid just look at Manhattan it's

437
00:19:12,480 --> 00:19:15,809
impossible to distinguish the roads from

438
00:19:14,220 --> 00:19:18,570
each other because they have no

439
00:19:15,809 --> 00:19:21,030
curvature whatsoever we need to rough

440
00:19:18,570 --> 00:19:24,178
knowledge of the city in the area but no

441
00:19:21,030 --> 00:19:25,830
starting point assumption and what we

442
00:19:24,179 --> 00:19:28,170
also did not consider our lane changes

443
00:19:25,830 --> 00:19:31,199
you turns or roundabouts whereas the

444
00:19:28,170 --> 00:19:33,600
former lane changes are as you can read

445
00:19:31,200 --> 00:19:35,800
in the paper should not be a big problem

446
00:19:33,600 --> 00:19:37,929
for Roxanna

447
00:19:35,800 --> 00:19:43,780
and now let's finally conclude this work

448
00:19:37,930 --> 00:19:46,630
so in this work we we we showed that

449
00:19:43,780 --> 00:19:49,090
driver location can be liable inferred

450
00:19:46,630 --> 00:19:51,670
by steering Lionel data and we

451
00:19:49,090 --> 00:19:53,379
introduced a new threat model since

452
00:19:51,670 --> 00:19:56,230
vehicle or telematics systems are on the

453
00:19:53,380 --> 00:19:59,110
rise and they allow third party apps to

454
00:19:56,230 --> 00:20:01,330
access sensitive eclair data so threat

455
00:19:59,110 --> 00:20:03,310
is real conducted an awareness survey

456
00:20:01,330 --> 00:20:06,010
where we showed that drivers are not

457
00:20:03,310 --> 00:20:07,929
really aware of the sensitivity and

458
00:20:06,010 --> 00:20:10,240
privacy consequences of most automotive

459
00:20:07,930 --> 00:20:12,220
sensors' and finally we show that Rock

460
00:20:10,240 --> 00:20:15,940
Yuma offers better performance than all

461
00:20:12,220 --> 00:20:16,300
sir which related work I want to thank
