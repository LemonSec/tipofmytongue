1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,950
I'm delighted that dev second came to

2
00:00:02,550 --> 00:00:06,270
Boston we all can agree that software

3
00:00:04,950 --> 00:00:08,940
power is not only critical

4
00:00:06,270 --> 00:00:10,320
infrastructure but our daily lives we're

5
00:00:08,940 --> 00:00:12,540
trying to start the conversation about

6
00:00:10,320 --> 00:00:14,460
the next generation of problems security

7
00:00:12,540 --> 00:00:15,928
needs to spend as much time if not more

8
00:00:14,460 --> 00:00:23,400
understanding the business so they can

9
00:00:15,929 --> 00:00:24,210
integrate and be effective Francois and

10
00:00:23,400 --> 00:00:26,669
the team have brought together

11
00:00:24,210 --> 00:00:29,279
tremendous group of vendors with a lot

12
00:00:26,670 --> 00:00:31,019
of experience in helping to get

13
00:00:29,279 --> 00:00:32,579
enterprises and companies over the

14
00:00:31,019 --> 00:00:34,230
challenges of security in the DevOps

15
00:00:32,579 --> 00:00:36,540
pipeline and securing application

16
00:00:34,230 --> 00:00:39,269
security and now basically you have a

17
00:00:36,540 --> 00:00:41,579
form share ideas to share best practices

18
00:00:39,270 --> 00:00:43,110
to create new networks and communication

19
00:00:41,579 --> 00:00:45,480
lines and I think this is just fantastic

20
00:00:43,110 --> 00:00:48,840
venue for that Boston is it's a great

21
00:00:45,480 --> 00:00:50,218
hub that is that it's nice because we

22
00:00:48,840 --> 00:00:52,649
can bring in people from like the

23
00:00:50,219 --> 00:00:54,570
emerging technology seeing that Boston

24
00:00:52,649 --> 00:00:56,550
has it's an easy commute for pretty much

25
00:00:54,570 --> 00:00:59,820
anywhere within the Greater Boston area

26
00:00:56,550 --> 00:01:01,410
so we're seeing people who can take time

27
00:00:59,820 --> 00:01:04,049
out of their day job without having like

28
00:01:01,410 --> 00:01:06,360
a a major impact and what they learn and

29
00:01:04,049 --> 00:01:07,619
what they're able to get today is

30
00:01:06,360 --> 00:01:09,110
something that they can actually take

31
00:01:07,619 --> 00:01:10,970
back immediately

32
00:01:09,110 --> 00:01:13,130

37
00:01:20,210 --> 00:01:23,960
here at dev second given our early stage

38
00:01:22,280 --> 00:01:27,080
