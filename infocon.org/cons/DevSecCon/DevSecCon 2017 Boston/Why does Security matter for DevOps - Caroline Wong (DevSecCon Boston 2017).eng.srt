1
00:00:05,060 --> 00:00:11,100
there's a lot of why's that we're going

2
00:00:07,890 --> 00:00:13,290
to talk about today why DevOps why

3
00:00:11,100 --> 00:00:14,610
security what are we supposed to do

4
00:00:13,290 --> 00:00:17,849
about it

5
00:00:14,610 --> 00:00:20,609
so we'll just dive in first things first

6
00:00:17,849 --> 00:00:22,529
why does DevOps matter anything this is

7
00:00:20,609 --> 00:00:28,289
gonna be a very like interactive talk

8
00:00:22,529 --> 00:00:31,829
why does DevOps matter anyone doing

9
00:00:28,289 --> 00:00:34,669
things faster faster faster which means

10
00:00:31,829 --> 00:00:34,669
faster time-to-market

11
00:00:36,560 --> 00:00:39,630
[Music]

12
00:00:40,789 --> 00:00:52,739
making it easier to reproduce what you

13
00:00:42,989 --> 00:00:53,940
did responsibilities yes all of these

14
00:00:52,739 --> 00:01:00,480
things all these things these are

15
00:00:53,940 --> 00:01:02,129
business reasons right yes you gotta be

16
00:01:00,480 --> 00:01:06,420
faster in the competition policy you can

17
00:01:02,129 --> 00:01:09,289
survive yes better communication between

18
00:01:06,420 --> 00:01:12,180
teams yes very much so

19
00:01:09,290 --> 00:01:16,439
businesses do what they need to do in

20
00:01:12,180 --> 00:01:17,549
order to survive and succeed so DevOps

21
00:01:16,439 --> 00:01:19,350
companies I don't think they don't

22
00:01:17,549 --> 00:01:21,810
necessarily have all the answers but

23
00:01:19,350 --> 00:01:24,089
they are inherently flexible they can

24
00:01:21,810 --> 00:01:28,049
iterate according to market feedback and

25
00:01:24,090 --> 00:01:30,600
business needs as everyone has said the

26
00:01:28,049 --> 00:01:32,880
faster you can go the less you spend on

27
00:01:30,600 --> 00:01:35,250
product development the fewer person

28
00:01:32,880 --> 00:01:38,158
hours are required to deliver a complete

29
00:01:35,250 --> 00:01:40,500
solution every iteration is an

30
00:01:38,159 --> 00:01:46,710
opportunity to deliver greater business

31
00:01:40,500 --> 00:01:49,320
value so DevOps is great DevOps is gonna

32
00:01:46,710 --> 00:01:50,669
save all of our organization's DevOps is

33
00:01:49,320 --> 00:01:53,969
going to give us this tremendous

34
00:01:50,670 --> 00:01:58,259
competitive advantage I want to do a

35
00:01:53,969 --> 00:02:01,859
reality check and say let's be real

36
00:01:58,259 --> 00:02:04,229
about where we are DevOps is still the

37
00:02:01,859 --> 00:02:07,530
new cool thing which means it's not

38
00:02:04,229 --> 00:02:10,050
totally mainstream puppet has been

39
00:02:07,530 --> 00:02:13,680
publishing its state of DevOps report

40
00:02:10,050 --> 00:02:14,040
for three years now and the 2017 version

41
00:02:13,680 --> 00:02:16,709
of that

42
00:02:14,040 --> 00:02:20,459
port says that 20 27 percent of

43
00:02:16,709 --> 00:02:23,730
organizations have made the switch that

44
00:02:20,459 --> 00:02:30,060
means that there are not I'm not really

45
00:02:23,730 --> 00:02:31,738
good at math on the spot 73 percent that

46
00:02:30,060 --> 00:02:33,530
if not right so the vast majority of

47
00:02:31,739 --> 00:02:35,939
organizations have not made the switch

48
00:02:33,530 --> 00:02:38,519
Gartner also has published a number that

49
00:02:35,939 --> 00:02:44,010
says 25 percent of global 2000

50
00:02:38,519 --> 00:02:47,129
organizations have adopted DevOps so why

51
00:02:44,010 --> 00:02:48,540
is this word all over the place you

52
00:02:47,129 --> 00:02:51,149
might think that everyone is using a

53
00:02:48,540 --> 00:02:53,548
DevOps model except for you but even if

54
00:02:51,150 --> 00:02:56,700
most organizations are thinking about

55
00:02:53,549 --> 00:02:58,379
making the switch many haven't yet and

56
00:02:56,700 --> 00:03:01,168
in my experience working with devops

57
00:02:58,379 --> 00:03:02,459
teams they're either teams that were

58
00:03:01,169 --> 00:03:06,810
born in DevOps

59
00:03:02,459 --> 00:03:10,650
or an organization which has a component

60
00:03:06,810 --> 00:03:12,930
which is sort of trying DevOps out so I

61
00:03:10,650 --> 00:03:15,150
think it's great that we have meetings

62
00:03:12,930 --> 00:03:18,389
like this to talk about this stuff

63
00:03:15,150 --> 00:03:20,129
because there's still an awful lot that

64
00:03:18,389 --> 00:03:22,079
needs to be figured out I think that's

65
00:03:20,129 --> 00:03:26,728
that's what is very exciting about this

66
00:03:22,079 --> 00:03:29,329
space I also want to as part of this

67
00:03:26,729 --> 00:03:31,739
reality check talk about automation

68
00:03:29,329 --> 00:03:34,260
there's a lot of cool things that

69
00:03:31,739 --> 00:03:37,049
automation can do but let's not forget

70
00:03:34,260 --> 00:03:39,418
that the only things that can be

71
00:03:37,049 --> 00:03:43,650
automated are the things that we already

72
00:03:39,419 --> 00:03:46,409
know how to do and we've gotten to such

73
00:03:43,650 --> 00:03:48,000
a standard process that we can do the

74
00:03:46,409 --> 00:03:51,260
same thing over and over again and we

75
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:54,870
can teach a computer program to do it so

76
00:03:51,260 --> 00:03:58,019
we talk about automation the most

77
00:03:54,870 --> 00:04:00,090
commonly automated tests are integration

78
00:03:58,019 --> 00:04:05,310
tests component and unit tests

79
00:04:00,090 --> 00:04:08,579
performance tests that being said manual

80
00:04:05,310 --> 00:04:11,250
testing is still very popular for things

81
00:04:08,579 --> 00:04:13,069
like user acceptance test usability

82
00:04:11,250 --> 00:04:14,819
tests and story level tests

83
00:04:13,069 --> 00:04:17,039
organizations are having a tough time

84
00:04:14,819 --> 00:04:18,959
automating everything which makes

85
00:04:17,039 --> 00:04:23,530
perfect sense there there are some

86
00:04:18,959 --> 00:04:26,800
things which rely on a human opinion

87
00:04:23,530 --> 00:04:30,580
and and spending time and money trying

88
00:04:26,800 --> 00:04:34,630
to automate things that require a human

89
00:04:30,580 --> 00:04:35,590
opinion and a human brain does make

90
00:04:34,630 --> 00:04:36,700
sense so there are things that are gonna

91
00:04:35,590 --> 00:04:39,340
be automated and there are things that

92
00:04:36,700 --> 00:04:43,000
are not gonna be automated and guess

93
00:04:39,340 --> 00:04:44,830
what your customers are human so that's

94
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:47,350
why when we talk about user acceptance

95
00:04:44,830 --> 00:04:50,409
and story level tests these are the ones

96
00:04:47,350 --> 00:04:53,440
that are not automated and guess what

97
00:04:50,410 --> 00:04:57,210
the people who are interested in

98
00:04:53,440 --> 00:05:01,330
attacking your software are also human

99
00:04:57,210 --> 00:05:03,760
they're not they're not computers so how

100
00:05:01,330 --> 00:05:10,090
is the role of security changing you

101
00:05:03,760 --> 00:05:12,039
know perhaps the folks in this room who

102
00:05:10,090 --> 00:05:14,619
are the DevOps folks

103
00:05:12,040 --> 00:05:16,000
rather than the security folks have come

104
00:05:14,620 --> 00:05:18,010
from an engineering background and a

105
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:21,760
security background all those two are

106
00:05:18,010 --> 00:05:24,130
not entirely exclusive you know you

107
00:05:21,760 --> 00:05:25,570
might be asking the question well we

108
00:05:24,130 --> 00:05:28,570
have a security team why won't they just

109
00:05:25,570 --> 00:05:31,630
take care of it of course as we've

110
00:05:28,570 --> 00:05:33,940
discussed in DevOps developers have much

111
00:05:31,630 --> 00:05:35,919
more power and changes happen quickly

112
00:05:33,940 --> 00:05:38,230
which means there's not always time for

113
00:05:35,919 --> 00:05:40,780
a traditional large scale security

114
00:05:38,230 --> 00:05:42,310
review that means it's critical for

115
00:05:40,780 --> 00:05:44,320
security to be built in to the

116
00:05:42,310 --> 00:05:46,950
development culture and also into the

117
00:05:44,320 --> 00:05:52,180
development and the deployment processes

118
00:05:46,950 --> 00:05:54,700
so I want to talk about DevOps and how

119
00:05:52,180 --> 00:06:00,600
that's changed things for security

120
00:05:54,700 --> 00:06:03,130
people so ten years ago and you know

121
00:06:00,600 --> 00:06:04,360
it's all a spectrum right there's so

122
00:06:03,130 --> 00:06:05,830
many different organizations with so

123
00:06:04,360 --> 00:06:08,919
many different approaches but generally

124
00:06:05,830 --> 00:06:12,400
speaking there's an approach to security

125
00:06:08,919 --> 00:06:15,250
that said we're an M&M right we're soft

126
00:06:12,400 --> 00:06:18,190
and squishy on the inside melty and

127
00:06:15,250 --> 00:06:21,090
we've got this hard candy shell and it's

128
00:06:18,190 --> 00:06:24,460
all about protecting the perimeter

129
00:06:21,090 --> 00:06:26,169
security would insert itself at various

130
00:06:24,460 --> 00:06:28,630
steps throughout the software

131
00:06:26,169 --> 00:06:30,729
development lifecycle and have an

132
00:06:28,630 --> 00:06:32,950
opportunity to review and improve things

133
00:06:30,730 --> 00:06:34,960
before they went on to the next step

134
00:06:32,950 --> 00:06:35,780
that works great in a waterfall software

135
00:06:34,960 --> 00:06:39,609
development method all

136
00:06:35,780 --> 00:06:42,679
J another thing that we had was

137
00:06:39,610 --> 00:06:45,889
on-premise data centers on-premise

138
00:06:42,680 --> 00:06:48,440
workforces who were using Organization

139
00:06:45,889 --> 00:06:52,610
issued mobile devices to do their work

140
00:06:48,440 --> 00:06:54,830
so today things look really different

141
00:06:52,610 --> 00:06:58,030
than they did ten years ago when it

142
00:06:54,830 --> 00:07:01,880
comes to technology so now we've got a

143
00:06:58,030 --> 00:07:05,419
vendor situation right my organization

144
00:07:01,880 --> 00:07:09,680
does not develop all of the software

145
00:07:05,419 --> 00:07:12,440
that it uses we depend a lot on other

146
00:07:09,680 --> 00:07:14,780
organizations to help us build our

147
00:07:12,440 --> 00:07:19,669
product whether that means sending your

148
00:07:14,780 --> 00:07:22,940
code to github or code ship you depend

149
00:07:19,669 --> 00:07:25,340
on other organizations using open-source

150
00:07:22,940 --> 00:07:28,070
code I know Black Duck is here you

151
00:07:25,340 --> 00:07:30,169
depend on code that's been written by

152
00:07:28,070 --> 00:07:33,280
someone else and there's risk involved

153
00:07:30,169 --> 00:07:37,130
in that and I say it goes both ways

154
00:07:33,280 --> 00:07:40,549
because most of our organizations are

155
00:07:37,130 --> 00:07:42,229
also vendors of some sort if you're not

156
00:07:40,550 --> 00:07:46,040
a security vendor you're selling

157
00:07:42,229 --> 00:07:49,669
something if you're a business and so

158
00:07:46,040 --> 00:07:52,820
your customer is now also going to have

159
00:07:49,669 --> 00:07:55,760
additional questions about your security

160
00:07:52,820 --> 00:07:58,820
if you're hosted in the cloud if you're

161
00:07:55,760 --> 00:08:01,849
using a DevOps methodology why should i

162
00:07:58,820 --> 00:08:05,570
as your potential customer trust you how

163
00:08:01,850 --> 00:08:09,050
do I know that by incorporating your

164
00:08:05,570 --> 00:08:15,770
product into mine that it's going to be

165
00:08:09,050 --> 00:08:17,510
secure because cloud has really changed

166
00:08:15,770 --> 00:08:20,030
the way that network and system

167
00:08:17,510 --> 00:08:22,370
infrastructure works there's a bigger

168
00:08:20,030 --> 00:08:26,500
focus for security professionals on

169
00:08:22,370 --> 00:08:30,560
applications and particularly api's when

170
00:08:26,500 --> 00:08:33,650
infrastructure is code then it's code

171
00:08:30,560 --> 00:08:37,640
security that matters and finally we've

172
00:08:33,650 --> 00:08:42,409
got mobile workforce employees of

173
00:08:37,640 --> 00:08:45,800
organizations are everywhere and they're

174
00:08:42,409 --> 00:08:49,450
connecting with their own devices which

175
00:08:45,800 --> 00:08:52,740
are not always totally can

176
00:08:49,450 --> 00:08:57,130
rolled by the organization they work for

177
00:08:52,740 --> 00:08:59,890
so the landscape is changing here's the

178
00:08:57,130 --> 00:09:02,170
next question for you guys which is why

179
00:08:59,890 --> 00:09:09,460
do you think that security matters for

180
00:09:02,170 --> 00:09:13,079
DevOps it's too easy to ship back code

181
00:09:09,460 --> 00:09:13,080
and what happens when you ship bad code

182
00:09:13,140 --> 00:09:18,610
bad things happen bad things happen and

183
00:09:15,790 --> 00:09:21,250
maybe in like DevOps words unplanned

184
00:09:18,610 --> 00:09:23,290
work happens and rework happens which of

185
00:09:21,250 --> 00:09:25,450
course takes the place of planned work

186
00:09:23,290 --> 00:09:26,800
and then you don't get those benefits of

187
00:09:25,450 --> 00:09:30,370
DevOps that we talked about in the first

188
00:09:26,800 --> 00:09:32,939
place any other thoughts on why security

189
00:09:30,370 --> 00:09:32,940
matters for DevOps

190
00:09:35,280 --> 00:09:39,760
yes

191
00:09:36,550 --> 00:09:41,949
moving security left fixing security

192
00:09:39,760 --> 00:09:59,050
issues sooner rather than later is

193
00:09:41,950 --> 00:10:02,320
cheaper one more time yes security is a

194
00:09:59,050 --> 00:10:04,359
part of quality and it inspires people

195
00:10:02,320 --> 00:10:06,100
perhaps it encourages people or requires

196
00:10:04,360 --> 00:10:15,070
people to write better quality code

197
00:10:06,100 --> 00:10:16,720
including security yes when you want to

198
00:10:15,070 --> 00:10:19,240
go fast traditional security doesn't

199
00:10:16,720 --> 00:10:23,130
work as we just discussed the landscape

200
00:10:19,240 --> 00:10:23,130
is changing security needs to change too

201
00:10:23,280 --> 00:10:31,030
thank you so I'm I'm gonna actually talk

202
00:10:27,850 --> 00:10:35,020
about ten companies who are killing it

203
00:10:31,030 --> 00:10:38,709
at DevOps and for each one I googled it

204
00:10:35,020 --> 00:10:44,620
and I look to see where security

205
00:10:38,710 --> 00:10:47,590
featured on their web pages so Adobe has

206
00:10:44,620 --> 00:10:48,760
a public facing security statement Adobe

207
00:10:47,590 --> 00:10:50,290
is a company that may or may not have

208
00:10:48,760 --> 00:10:51,880
had some security issues in the past and

209
00:10:50,290 --> 00:10:53,740
they need to convince their customers

210
00:10:51,880 --> 00:10:56,200
and their users that indeed they are

211
00:10:53,740 --> 00:10:58,830
secure and security is a priority this

212
00:10:56,200 --> 00:11:01,860
is a business imperative for Adobe

213
00:10:58,830 --> 00:11:05,160
Facebook also has a security page

214
00:11:01,860 --> 00:11:09,610
similar reasons

215
00:11:05,160 --> 00:11:15,040
Amazon AWS cloud security because how

216
00:11:09,610 --> 00:11:20,290
could AWS run unless the users believed

217
00:11:15,040 --> 00:11:27,040
that it was secure fidelity has a

218
00:11:20,290 --> 00:11:28,719
public-facing security page Walmart who

219
00:11:27,040 --> 00:11:30,699
knew that Walmart was a DevOps shop but

220
00:11:28,720 --> 00:11:37,230
tech Deacon says that it's one of the 10

221
00:11:30,700 --> 00:11:40,149
companies killing in it DevOps Etsy is

222
00:11:37,230 --> 00:11:43,480
like a yarn shop right but they had

223
00:11:40,149 --> 00:11:45,360
Shayne Lackey and you know he did the

224
00:11:43,480 --> 00:11:50,110
whole DevOps security thing over there

225
00:11:45,360 --> 00:11:52,480
also public-facing website arguably

226
00:11:50,110 --> 00:11:54,850
marketing using security as a

227
00:11:52,480 --> 00:11:57,820
competitive differentiator use our

228
00:11:54,850 --> 00:12:00,160
service we want you to know that we're

229
00:11:57,820 --> 00:12:02,800
secure don't be afraid to use our

230
00:12:00,160 --> 00:12:13,390
service because you don't need to worry

231
00:12:02,800 --> 00:12:15,699
that we're not secure Netflix Target CEO

232
00:12:13,390 --> 00:12:17,589
got fired shortly after the security

233
00:12:15,700 --> 00:12:20,200
breach and this was a guy who had worked

234
00:12:17,589 --> 00:12:22,870
his way up right this is not like a new

235
00:12:20,200 --> 00:12:24,130
CEO who came in a breach occurred you

236
00:12:22,870 --> 00:12:26,440
know person has moved out this is

237
00:12:24,130 --> 00:12:28,990
someone who started out at like an

238
00:12:26,440 --> 00:12:31,020
entry-level made his way up established

239
00:12:28,990 --> 00:12:34,120
a history at the organization

240
00:12:31,020 --> 00:12:36,970
security breach is one of probably a few

241
00:12:34,120 --> 00:12:42,839
things that led to that person being

242
00:12:36,970 --> 00:12:42,839
asked to leave the company Sony

243
00:12:43,980 --> 00:12:53,709
Nordstrom so I'm awfully pragmatic when

244
00:12:52,029 --> 00:12:56,560
it comes to why security matters and

245
00:12:53,709 --> 00:12:58,949
there are really just three reasons and

246
00:12:56,560 --> 00:13:03,180
I really just think it's one reason so

247
00:12:58,949 --> 00:13:06,160
the first one sales support and

248
00:13:03,180 --> 00:13:08,500
acquisition if you're trying to sell a

249
00:13:06,160 --> 00:13:11,140
product and your customer or your

250
00:13:08,500 --> 00:13:13,180
require wants to know what your security

251
00:13:11,140 --> 00:13:17,500
situation is you better have a good

252
00:13:13,180 --> 00:13:19,150
answer number two

253
00:13:17,500 --> 00:13:20,890
the company wants to avoid negative

254
00:13:19,150 --> 00:13:23,800
press headlines we saw a few of those

255
00:13:20,890 --> 00:13:27,370
when we looked at the top ten companies

256
00:13:23,800 --> 00:13:29,589
killing in a DevOps the company wants to

257
00:13:27,370 --> 00:13:32,230
avoid negative press headlines resulting

258
00:13:29,590 --> 00:13:34,180
from a security breach but let's think

259
00:13:32,230 --> 00:13:37,030
about that for a moment because isn't

260
00:13:34,180 --> 00:13:40,689
the reason that any companies cares

261
00:13:37,030 --> 00:13:43,150
about press because it doesn't want bad

262
00:13:40,690 --> 00:13:46,990
press to affect their sales or their

263
00:13:43,150 --> 00:13:50,709
potential acquisitions Verizon and Yahoo

264
00:13:46,990 --> 00:13:52,330
I think Verizon got like a four hundred

265
00:13:50,710 --> 00:13:54,330
and eighty million dollar discount on

266
00:13:52,330 --> 00:13:57,040
their acquisition following the breach

267
00:13:54,330 --> 00:14:00,460
so I think that means we're really just

268
00:13:57,040 --> 00:14:04,120
back to one reason which is sales and

269
00:14:00,460 --> 00:14:08,800
acquisition and bad presses is perhaps a

270
00:14:04,120 --> 00:14:11,800
part of that compliance this is why I

271
00:14:08,800 --> 00:14:14,500
joined the ebay security team because

272
00:14:11,800 --> 00:14:17,589
the company needed to comply with PCI

273
00:14:14,500 --> 00:14:20,260
and Sox other organizations may need to

274
00:14:17,590 --> 00:14:22,870
comply with HIPAA gdpr is becoming a

275
00:14:20,260 --> 00:14:25,030
thing or another requirement in order to

276
00:14:22,870 --> 00:14:27,010
do business or meet a customer

277
00:14:25,030 --> 00:14:29,439
requirement I've actually heard of

278
00:14:27,010 --> 00:14:31,780
organizations that choose not to meet

279
00:14:29,440 --> 00:14:34,570
compliance requirements again as a

280
00:14:31,780 --> 00:14:37,839
business decision because it's business

281
00:14:34,570 --> 00:14:41,290
trade-off to say well we need to invest

282
00:14:37,840 --> 00:14:44,650
X amount in order to be compliant you

283
00:14:41,290 --> 00:14:47,439
know and if we're not the the the risk

284
00:14:44,650 --> 00:14:49,900
is gonna be Y amount and so we're just

285
00:14:47,440 --> 00:14:52,410
gonna take that business risk at the end

286
00:14:49,900 --> 00:14:58,150
of the day it's all about sales and

287
00:14:52,410 --> 00:15:00,579
survival and business so there is

288
00:14:58,150 --> 00:15:01,780
another reason okay so this is so this

289
00:15:00,580 --> 00:15:03,280
is weird when you google when you're

290
00:15:01,780 --> 00:15:06,400
trying to do a presentation and you're

291
00:15:03,280 --> 00:15:10,120
trying to find a slide that shows a C so

292
00:15:06,400 --> 00:15:13,870
sleeping at night you get all sorts of

293
00:15:10,120 --> 00:15:17,500
inappropriate images and so I chose this

294
00:15:13,870 --> 00:15:20,320
cat wine to show like what's another

295
00:15:17,500 --> 00:15:22,450
reason for security so your VP of

296
00:15:20,320 --> 00:15:25,870
engineering so you're director of DevOps

297
00:15:22,450 --> 00:15:29,920
so your seaso can sleep at night and I

298
00:15:25,870 --> 00:15:30,970
think again that's because ultimately of

299
00:15:29,920 --> 00:15:34,180
sales

300
00:15:30,970 --> 00:15:37,570
there's this idea that one should not

301
00:15:34,180 --> 00:15:38,819
put a 200 dollar fence around a five

302
00:15:37,570 --> 00:15:41,920
dollar asset

303
00:15:38,820 --> 00:15:44,500
the whole reason DevOps exists is to

304
00:15:41,920 --> 00:15:48,780
help the business the whole reason

305
00:15:44,500 --> 00:15:48,780
security exists is to help the business

306
00:15:49,200 --> 00:15:57,100
so in 2002 Bill Gates

307
00:15:54,160 --> 00:16:00,910
sent out this memo and it was about

308
00:15:57,100 --> 00:16:04,630
trustworthy computing and if you've read

309
00:16:00,910 --> 00:16:08,020
the media it seems like an awfully noble

310
00:16:04,630 --> 00:16:12,220
cause let's take a look at some of the

311
00:16:08,020 --> 00:16:15,520
specific text in his memo over the last

312
00:16:12,220 --> 00:16:17,920
year it has become clear that ensuring

313
00:16:15,520 --> 00:16:20,560
dotnet is a platform for trust where the

314
00:16:17,920 --> 00:16:23,890
computing is more important than any

315
00:16:20,560 --> 00:16:26,260
other part of our work if we don't do

316
00:16:23,890 --> 00:16:29,560
this people simply won't be willing or

317
00:16:26,260 --> 00:16:32,800
able to take advantage of all the other

318
00:16:29,560 --> 00:16:36,640
great work that we do so Bill Gates sent

319
00:16:32,800 --> 00:16:38,439
out this company-wide memo and it's

320
00:16:36,640 --> 00:16:41,140
because Microsoft was starting to get

321
00:16:38,440 --> 00:16:43,090
questions about its security and it

322
00:16:41,140 --> 00:16:49,650
didn't want security to get in the way

323
00:16:43,090 --> 00:16:49,650
of its sales it's all about the money

324
00:16:51,900 --> 00:16:58,480
I'm sorry it's all about the Benjamins

325
00:16:55,750 --> 00:17:02,050
there I wish I could figure out a way to

326
00:16:58,480 --> 00:17:03,820
have like you know one five second clip

327
00:17:02,050 --> 00:17:05,438
of a song play like right and I'm sure

328
00:17:03,820 --> 00:17:07,030
there's a way to do that I I'm sure I

329
00:17:05,439 --> 00:17:11,470
will figure it out for the next time

330
00:17:07,030 --> 00:17:16,209
that that I do this presentation so what

331
00:17:11,470 --> 00:17:18,310
is a person supposed to do so say you

332
00:17:16,209 --> 00:17:22,780
are a VP of engineering say you are a

333
00:17:18,310 --> 00:17:26,849
director of DevOps and you have to go

334
00:17:22,780 --> 00:17:29,639
and do security where do you start

335
00:17:26,849 --> 00:17:32,490
I've heard numbers like there's 8,000

336
00:17:29,639 --> 00:17:36,209
security vendors I've heard numbers like

337
00:17:32,490 --> 00:17:38,730
there's 14,000 security vendors even if

338
00:17:36,210 --> 00:17:40,169
you have an awfully open door policy

339
00:17:38,730 --> 00:17:43,320
when it comes to security vendors

340
00:17:40,169 --> 00:17:45,539
there's an impossible way that you could

341
00:17:43,320 --> 00:17:50,460
hear everyone's pitch and try and decide

342
00:17:45,539 --> 00:17:52,350
what it does it you need to do so maybe

343
00:17:50,460 --> 00:17:56,880
you would look to frameworks and

344
00:17:52,350 --> 00:18:00,629
standards there's a super cool framework

345
00:17:56,880 --> 00:18:02,940
called the besom besom was started about

346
00:18:00,629 --> 00:18:06,840
nine years ago it's a descriptive model

347
00:18:02,940 --> 00:18:09,659
of software security activities and it

348
00:18:06,840 --> 00:18:11,970
has a hundred and twelve controls that's

349
00:18:09,659 --> 00:18:13,710
a lot of things to be able to have to do

350
00:18:11,970 --> 00:18:17,009
that's a lot of things to even go

351
00:18:13,710 --> 00:18:20,429
through and decide which ones are we

352
00:18:17,009 --> 00:18:22,470
gonna do one hundred and twelve control

353
00:18:20,429 --> 00:18:25,370
elements this is an old slide I actually

354
00:18:22,470 --> 00:18:28,740
think there's a hundred and thirteen now

355
00:18:25,370 --> 00:18:31,500
so ISO ISO makes standards they make

356
00:18:28,740 --> 00:18:35,309
really good standards ISO 27001 ISO

357
00:18:31,500 --> 00:18:41,820
27000 - there's a cloud version which is

358
00:18:35,309 --> 00:18:44,370
ISO 2720 ISO 27001 seven and guess what

359
00:18:41,820 --> 00:18:47,490
it costs a hundred and fifty dollars to

360
00:18:44,370 --> 00:18:50,580
even get the standard besom is free I

361
00:18:47,490 --> 00:18:53,220
did the conversion on Google from Swiss

362
00:18:50,580 --> 00:18:56,279
francs and there are a hundred and

363
00:18:53,220 --> 00:19:00,529
twenty one control elements how are you

364
00:18:56,279 --> 00:19:02,700
supposed to do that so you could go to

365
00:19:00,529 --> 00:19:04,080
another organization called the Cloud

366
00:19:02,700 --> 00:19:08,190
Security Alliance and you could look at

367
00:19:04,080 --> 00:19:13,799
their cloud controls matrix 133 control

368
00:19:08,190 --> 00:19:20,159
elements this is the job of a security

369
00:19:13,799 --> 00:19:21,690
policy analyst and I think there are

370
00:19:20,159 --> 00:19:23,669
like some people in the world who like

371
00:19:21,690 --> 00:19:25,139
going through this stuff I'm not one of

372
00:19:23,669 --> 00:19:27,480
those people even though I did do that

373
00:19:25,139 --> 00:19:30,149
job for a while and so it's enough to

374
00:19:27,480 --> 00:19:32,129
make a person's brain explode right even

375
00:19:30,149 --> 00:19:34,529
if you are a security professional even

376
00:19:32,129 --> 00:19:38,428
if you do have security background and

377
00:19:34,529 --> 00:19:39,650
experience and if you are not then it's

378
00:19:38,429 --> 00:19:41,630
just like it's

379
00:19:39,650 --> 00:19:54,140
just too much it's too much so how can

380
00:19:41,630 --> 00:19:56,690
we simplify security for DevOps security

381
00:19:54,140 --> 00:20:00,020
is about preventing bad things from

382
00:19:56,690 --> 00:20:03,320
happening because if you release low

383
00:20:00,020 --> 00:20:06,200
quality insecure code bad things will

384
00:20:03,320 --> 00:20:07,939
happen what does it mean for a bad thing

385
00:20:06,200 --> 00:20:10,400
to happen it means you're doing

386
00:20:07,940 --> 00:20:12,260
unplanned work which means that you're

387
00:20:10,400 --> 00:20:13,640
taking time away from planned work and

388
00:20:12,260 --> 00:20:15,590
it means that you're doing rework which

389
00:20:13,640 --> 00:20:18,650
again means that you're taking time away

390
00:20:15,590 --> 00:20:22,370
from planned work it's also about trust

391
00:20:18,650 --> 00:20:27,380
so somebody had mentioned that culture

392
00:20:22,370 --> 00:20:31,909
is a big part of DevOps and I've been in

393
00:20:27,380 --> 00:20:37,820
enough organizations to see scenarios

394
00:20:31,910 --> 00:20:39,560
where the culture of a team works and

395
00:20:37,820 --> 00:20:42,919
people are actually working together and

396
00:20:39,560 --> 00:20:45,530
they actually trust each other and I've

397
00:20:42,920 --> 00:20:47,900
seen scenarios where people don't trust

398
00:20:45,530 --> 00:20:52,580
each other and what are some mistakes

399
00:20:47,900 --> 00:20:57,040
that security people make which results

400
00:20:52,580 --> 00:20:57,040
in other people not trusting security

401
00:20:58,210 --> 00:21:02,720
when the security person walks in and

402
00:21:00,890 --> 00:21:06,590
says look we need to do security here's

403
00:21:02,720 --> 00:21:09,290
a list of 133 things and then the dev

404
00:21:06,590 --> 00:21:11,810
ops person says clearly you don't

405
00:21:09,290 --> 00:21:13,310
understand how this works and the

406
00:21:11,810 --> 00:21:19,250
business person says clearly you don't

407
00:21:13,310 --> 00:21:21,710
understand how this works so it's

408
00:21:19,250 --> 00:21:24,650
important to again remember that DevOps

409
00:21:21,710 --> 00:21:27,950
exists to support the business security

410
00:21:24,650 --> 00:21:29,810
exists to support the business I think

411
00:21:27,950 --> 00:21:32,710
it's important for security

412
00:21:29,810 --> 00:21:35,419
professionals to spend as much time

413
00:21:32,710 --> 00:21:38,450
learning about the business and learning

414
00:21:35,420 --> 00:21:41,540
about their organizations flavor of

415
00:21:38,450 --> 00:21:43,310
DevOps just as much time as they spend

416
00:21:41,540 --> 00:21:47,200
learning about the latest security

417
00:21:43,310 --> 00:21:47,200
breach the latest security vulnerability

418
00:21:48,030 --> 00:21:54,570
so here's my simplification instead of a

419
00:21:51,750 --> 00:21:56,970
hundred plus controls there is this

420
00:21:54,570 --> 00:22:01,379
framework called the NIST cybersecurity

421
00:21:56,970 --> 00:22:03,240
framework and I like it because it's

422
00:22:01,380 --> 00:22:06,080
easy to understand and it's very

423
00:22:03,240 --> 00:22:09,180
pragmatic the approach is based on

424
00:22:06,080 --> 00:22:12,419
responding to an incident which is the

425
00:22:09,180 --> 00:22:16,230
way that security actually affects

426
00:22:12,420 --> 00:22:19,010
organizations in 2013 President Barack

427
00:22:16,230 --> 00:22:20,970
Obama issued an executive order titled

428
00:22:19,010 --> 00:22:23,460
improving critical infrastructure

429
00:22:20,970 --> 00:22:25,770
security and it was all about enhancing

430
00:22:23,460 --> 00:22:28,260
the security and the resilience of

431
00:22:25,770 --> 00:22:30,870
critical infrastructure and maintaining

432
00:22:28,260 --> 00:22:33,270
a cyber environment that encourages

433
00:22:30,870 --> 00:22:36,919
efficiency innovation and economic

434
00:22:33,270 --> 00:22:39,180
prosperity so whereas security

435
00:22:36,920 --> 00:22:43,670
traditionally perhaps has been seen as a

436
00:22:39,180 --> 00:22:47,120
blocker and a stopper and a weight for

437
00:22:43,670 --> 00:22:47,120
and a Delayer

438
00:22:48,410 --> 00:22:53,280
this approach is different this approach

439
00:22:51,210 --> 00:22:54,870
is saying look we need our critical

440
00:22:53,280 --> 00:22:57,379
infrastructure and it can be extended to

441
00:22:54,870 --> 00:23:01,560
other organizations and businesses to be

442
00:22:57,380 --> 00:23:03,060
efficient innovative and prosperous so

443
00:23:01,560 --> 00:23:04,740
this executive order calls to the

444
00:23:03,060 --> 00:23:06,470
development of a voluntary risk-based

445
00:23:04,740 --> 00:23:09,660
cybersecurity framework and here you go

446
00:23:06,470 --> 00:23:12,720
these are sort of the five components

447
00:23:09,660 --> 00:23:15,660
and I think it just makes sense right so

448
00:23:12,720 --> 00:23:17,550
I'm gonna even simplify it for you one

449
00:23:15,660 --> 00:23:22,080
step further and take it from five

450
00:23:17,550 --> 00:23:26,639
things to three so we've gone from 133

451
00:23:22,080 --> 00:23:29,790
120 113 down to five and I'm gonna say

452
00:23:26,640 --> 00:23:31,590
we're going down to three three steps to

453
00:23:29,790 --> 00:23:35,070
doing security for DevOps

454
00:23:31,590 --> 00:23:37,500
the first is to identify what's your

455
00:23:35,070 --> 00:23:42,000
business environment and what's your

456
00:23:37,500 --> 00:23:45,540
DevOps process the second is to prevent

457
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:48,750
and there's an analogy that's been used

458
00:23:45,540 --> 00:23:51,830
in security that says you know doing

459
00:23:48,750 --> 00:23:53,880
security it's like taking a multivitamin

460
00:23:51,830 --> 00:23:58,530
doing security it's like brushing your

461
00:23:53,880 --> 00:24:03,570
teeth and that's fine but

462
00:23:58,530 --> 00:24:06,780
the results of brushing your teeth you

463
00:24:03,570 --> 00:24:11,669
know they're not like so immediate so I

464
00:24:06,780 --> 00:24:16,050
I prefer an analogy that says if your

465
00:24:11,670 --> 00:24:17,960
business depends on cars to deliver

466
00:24:16,050 --> 00:24:20,580
product on time

467
00:24:17,960 --> 00:24:22,200
those cars need to have regularly

468
00:24:20,580 --> 00:24:24,570
scheduled maintenance they need to have

469
00:24:22,200 --> 00:24:27,210
oil changes because if you take the time

470
00:24:24,570 --> 00:24:29,100
to do all changes and regularly

471
00:24:27,210 --> 00:24:31,650
scheduled maintenance then you will

472
00:24:29,100 --> 00:24:34,080
prevent the car from breaking down and

473
00:24:31,650 --> 00:24:35,880
not being able to deliver whatever you

474
00:24:34,080 --> 00:24:38,879
need to deliver on time so is this

475
00:24:35,880 --> 00:24:41,370
concept of preventive maintenance and

476
00:24:38,880 --> 00:24:44,010
what I really like about the NIST

477
00:24:41,370 --> 00:24:49,139
cybersecurity framework is it puts it in

478
00:24:44,010 --> 00:24:52,590
the context of an incident so the the

479
00:24:49,140 --> 00:24:54,060
remaining three components of the NIST

480
00:24:52,590 --> 00:24:56,699
cybersecurity framework are detect

481
00:24:54,060 --> 00:24:59,040
respond and recover I've sort of bundled

482
00:24:56,700 --> 00:25:01,560
that together and said we're gonna call

483
00:24:59,040 --> 00:25:04,620
that react so we've got five minutes

484
00:25:01,560 --> 00:25:07,440
let's go through each of these number

485
00:25:04,620 --> 00:25:07,860
one identify learn about the business

486
00:25:07,440 --> 00:25:09,720
again

487
00:25:07,860 --> 00:25:11,939
DevOps exists to support the business

488
00:25:09,720 --> 00:25:15,420
security exists to support the business

489
00:25:11,940 --> 00:25:18,060
spend as much time learning about how

490
00:25:15,420 --> 00:25:20,040
your business works and about the DevOps

491
00:25:18,060 --> 00:25:21,480
process and toolchain as you spend

492
00:25:20,040 --> 00:25:24,960
learning about the latest security

493
00:25:21,480 --> 00:25:27,660
breach or vulnerability it destroys

494
00:25:24,960 --> 00:25:29,730
trust when a security person walks into

495
00:25:27,660 --> 00:25:33,830
the room and talks about something

496
00:25:29,730 --> 00:25:36,090
that's either irrelevant or theoretical

497
00:25:33,830 --> 00:25:38,040
that just that just that just doesn't

498
00:25:36,090 --> 00:25:41,250
that doesn't work for this trust thing

499
00:25:38,040 --> 00:25:42,930
right a DevOps professional has to

500
00:25:41,250 --> 00:25:45,210
believe that a security professional is

501
00:25:42,930 --> 00:25:47,340
actually there to help them not to get

502
00:25:45,210 --> 00:25:49,200
in their way not to slow them down not

503
00:25:47,340 --> 00:25:52,379
to prevent them from getting their work

504
00:25:49,200 --> 00:25:55,200
done so learn the business understand

505
00:25:52,380 --> 00:25:57,660
the business how do you do that go to

506
00:25:55,200 --> 00:26:01,320
your business process owners and ask

507
00:25:57,660 --> 00:26:03,090
them what their objectives are and then

508
00:26:01,320 --> 00:26:05,370
make a list of things that jeopardize

509
00:26:03,090 --> 00:26:08,760
those goals understand what the value

510
00:26:05,370 --> 00:26:11,000
chains are in your business link those

511
00:26:08,760 --> 00:26:12,499
business objectives to how technology

512
00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:16,039
jeopardizes

513
00:26:12,499 --> 00:26:18,269
make sure you consider your supply chain

514
00:26:16,039 --> 00:26:19,289
who are your vendors how are you

515
00:26:18,269 --> 00:26:21,659
connected to them what are your

516
00:26:19,289 --> 00:26:24,210
dependencies if your service code goes

517
00:26:21,659 --> 00:26:25,740
out to github encode chip you know

518
00:26:24,210 --> 00:26:27,090
potentially you're giving them secrets

519
00:26:25,740 --> 00:26:28,350
what secrets are you giving out how do

520
00:26:27,090 --> 00:26:30,299
you manage those secrets how do you

521
00:26:28,350 --> 00:26:31,649
connect to your back-end database how do

522
00:26:30,299 --> 00:26:33,149
you connect to your third-party api's

523
00:26:31,649 --> 00:26:35,399
this is threat modeling this is

524
00:26:33,149 --> 00:26:38,610
understanding how are your systems

525
00:26:35,399 --> 00:26:40,529
architected ask questions like why do we

526
00:26:38,610 --> 00:26:45,289
trust github why do we trust coaching

527
00:26:40,529 --> 00:26:49,320
why would our customer trust us and

528
00:26:45,289 --> 00:26:52,169
eliminate scope where you can so Y

529
00:26:49,320 --> 00:26:53,460
process credit cards if someone else

530
00:26:52,169 --> 00:26:55,980
that's like all they do and they're

531
00:26:53,460 --> 00:26:57,929
really good at it and then if you don't

532
00:26:55,980 --> 00:26:59,789
do it and they do it then you don't have

533
00:26:57,929 --> 00:27:03,330
to deal with the security part or if you

534
00:26:59,789 --> 00:27:06,480
do process credit card information other

535
00:27:03,330 --> 00:27:08,820
sensitive information you know keep it

536
00:27:06,480 --> 00:27:10,649
in one place so that you don't have to

537
00:27:08,820 --> 00:27:12,990
apply all your security controls all

538
00:27:10,649 --> 00:27:17,309
over the place you can just apply them

539
00:27:12,990 --> 00:27:21,149
to to that place where they are number

540
00:27:17,309 --> 00:27:23,570
two is prevent so awareness is really

541
00:27:21,149 --> 00:27:28,529
important culture

542
00:27:23,570 --> 00:27:32,460
what do devops people think about so I

543
00:27:28,529 --> 00:27:35,429
started my career at eBay I was there

544
00:27:32,460 --> 00:27:38,299
from 2005 to 2010 in 2014 there was a

545
00:27:35,429 --> 00:27:42,330
massive data breach what happened

546
00:27:38,299 --> 00:27:44,158
eBay employees were fished and how do

547
00:27:42,330 --> 00:27:45,840
you prevent something like that from

548
00:27:44,159 --> 00:27:47,610
happening because there's all this tech

549
00:27:45,840 --> 00:27:50,158
sols automation there's all these

550
00:27:47,610 --> 00:27:52,799
controls at the end of the day there are

551
00:27:50,159 --> 00:27:55,669
people who run your business and one of

552
00:27:52,799 --> 00:27:58,200
these people know about security and

553
00:27:55,669 --> 00:28:01,649
there are tons of organizations who will

554
00:27:58,200 --> 00:28:03,960
sell you try and sell you computer based

555
00:28:01,649 --> 00:28:05,459
training and there's some CBT that's

556
00:28:03,960 --> 00:28:07,830
great there's some CBT that's not great

557
00:28:05,460 --> 00:28:12,169
and instructor-led training and how much

558
00:28:07,830 --> 00:28:18,059
of that training is about those 130

559
00:28:12,169 --> 00:28:21,090
cloud controls that 120 ISO 27 2707 teen

560
00:28:18,059 --> 00:28:23,340
controls that 113 besom controls how

561
00:28:21,090 --> 00:28:26,189
much of that training is theoretical and

562
00:28:23,340 --> 00:28:29,730
not relevant why

563
00:28:26,190 --> 00:28:31,740
not build your training based on actual

564
00:28:29,730 --> 00:28:34,860
incidents that have occurred at your

565
00:28:31,740 --> 00:28:36,330
organization and every organization if

566
00:28:34,860 --> 00:28:40,379
you're doing some logging and monitoring

567
00:28:36,330 --> 00:28:43,289
and learning has had incidents and on

568
00:28:40,379 --> 00:28:46,259
top of that maybe you're doing something

569
00:28:43,289 --> 00:28:48,899
like on demand pen testing and you're

570
00:28:46,259 --> 00:28:53,039
finding out real ways that real people

571
00:28:48,899 --> 00:28:54,418
could exploit your systems policy and

572
00:28:53,039 --> 00:28:55,970
procedures you know there's a place for

573
00:28:54,419 --> 00:28:58,289
these things in both the traditional

574
00:28:55,970 --> 00:29:01,350
security world as well as the DevOps

575
00:28:58,289 --> 00:29:05,429
security world things that matter a lot

576
00:29:01,350 --> 00:29:07,049
in DevOps change management who's making

577
00:29:05,429 --> 00:29:09,059
what commits were those reviewed were

578
00:29:07,049 --> 00:29:12,360
those approved even if it's just by a

579
00:29:09,059 --> 00:29:16,259
peer and not you know some sort of ivory

580
00:29:12,360 --> 00:29:18,059
tower person even if there's a whole set

581
00:29:16,259 --> 00:29:19,440
of changes that can happen and get

582
00:29:18,059 --> 00:29:20,908
automatically approved you know but

583
00:29:19,440 --> 00:29:22,799
there are these high risk changes that

584
00:29:20,909 --> 00:29:24,600
need to go through a change review board

585
00:29:22,799 --> 00:29:26,340
not every change needs to go through a

586
00:29:24,600 --> 00:29:27,959
change review board but there are some

587
00:29:26,340 --> 00:29:28,889
that should and what are those for your

588
00:29:27,960 --> 00:29:31,049
business what are those critical

589
00:29:28,889 --> 00:29:35,158
critical components that could cause

590
00:29:31,049 --> 00:29:37,379
something to blow up reducing technical

591
00:29:35,159 --> 00:29:39,809
debt so this is where I get into like

592
00:29:37,379 --> 00:29:43,649
oil changes for your car I am out of

593
00:29:39,809 --> 00:29:45,178
time we're gonna go super quick update

594
00:29:43,649 --> 00:29:46,830
your software implement your vendor

595
00:29:45,179 --> 00:29:49,830
patches figure out a way to do that on

596
00:29:46,830 --> 00:29:52,019
demand security testing I talked to a

597
00:29:49,830 --> 00:29:53,490
director of DevOps and he says look we

598
00:29:52,019 --> 00:29:55,620
do a lot of cool stuff we work with

599
00:29:53,490 --> 00:29:57,899
vendors we'd like to work with vendors

600
00:29:55,620 --> 00:29:59,850
to tell us that what we're doing is

601
00:29:57,899 --> 00:30:04,110
actually what we think we're doing like

602
00:29:59,850 --> 00:30:08,309
writing secure code react this is about

603
00:30:04,110 --> 00:30:09,870
responding to an incident detecting do

604
00:30:08,309 --> 00:30:12,629
you know when an incident is gonna occur

605
00:30:09,870 --> 00:30:14,729
logging monitoring alerting responding

606
00:30:12,629 --> 00:30:17,418
do you have an incident response plan in

607
00:30:14,730 --> 00:30:20,490
place what about your supply chain and

608
00:30:17,419 --> 00:30:22,590
recovering when you have an incident how

609
00:30:20,490 --> 00:30:25,850
do you incorporate that into your

610
00:30:22,590 --> 00:30:28,230
prevention controls key takeaways

611
00:30:25,850 --> 00:30:30,240
security has to be business driven it

612
00:30:28,230 --> 00:30:33,629
has to be on demand it has to be built

613
00:30:30,240 --> 00:30:35,610
to fit a culture of trust in closing

614
00:30:33,629 --> 00:30:37,230
businesses will do what they need to do

615
00:30:35,610 --> 00:30:38,908
to survive and succeed if their

616
00:30:37,230 --> 00:30:40,080
customers need agility then they will

617
00:30:38,909 --> 00:30:42,149
evolve to accommodate

618
00:30:40,080 --> 00:30:43,889
that security needs to spend as much

619
00:30:42,149 --> 00:30:45,389
time if not more understanding the

620
00:30:43,890 --> 00:30:47,669
business so they can integrate and be

621
00:30:45,390 --> 00:30:49,590
effective the difference when it comes

622
00:30:47,669 --> 00:30:52,260
to cloud and DevOps is that security can

623
00:30:49,590 --> 00:30:53,639
be a business driver as customers need

624
00:30:52,260 --> 00:30:54,690
assurance that the products and

625
00:30:53,640 --> 00:30:56,570
solutions they are buying and

626
00:30:54,690 --> 00:30:59,130
integrating are trustworthy and secure

627
00:30:56,570 --> 00:31:00,480
sorry for running over time if you have

628
00:30:59,130 --> 00:31:01,880
questions we should talk about them

629
00:31:00,480 --> 00:31:09,189
thank you

630
00:31:01,880 --> 00:31:09,189
[Applause]
