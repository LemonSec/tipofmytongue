1
00:00:06,620 --> 00:00:10,860
so first you know what is shifting left

2
00:00:08,970 --> 00:00:14,130
I think you know it's it's a it's a

3
00:00:10,860 --> 00:00:17,009
phrase at least in this circle that is

4
00:00:14,130 --> 00:00:18,690
fairly well understood but I also have

5
00:00:17,010 --> 00:00:20,789
to explain what I do to my parents still

6
00:00:18,690 --> 00:00:23,430
and like shifting left what does this

7
00:00:20,789 --> 00:00:25,710
mean and what security I hear about

8
00:00:23,430 --> 00:00:28,439
breaches now we hear about the Equifax

9
00:00:25,710 --> 00:00:31,050
thing I heard something else you know

10
00:00:28,439 --> 00:00:33,660
what's going on what what do we do so

11
00:00:31,050 --> 00:00:35,880
shifting left is very simply like how do

12
00:00:33,660 --> 00:00:38,578
we bring security testing or testing in

13
00:00:35,880 --> 00:00:40,410
general and looking for defects earlier

14
00:00:38,579 --> 00:00:43,980
on in the development lifecycle

15
00:00:40,410 --> 00:00:45,379
and the analogy I have used is look if

16
00:00:43,980 --> 00:00:47,940
I'm writing a novel like war and peace

17
00:00:45,379 --> 00:00:49,949
wouldn't I rather do spell checking and

18
00:00:47,940 --> 00:00:51,959
grammatical checking while I'm writing

19
00:00:49,950 --> 00:00:54,300
each chapter instead of waiting til I

20
00:00:51,960 --> 00:00:56,160
have the whole novel done and then

21
00:00:54,300 --> 00:00:57,660
having to go back and proofread it and

22
00:00:56,160 --> 00:01:00,000
check for errors and do that I mean that

23
00:00:57,660 --> 00:01:02,160
that's the gate kind of like security

24
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:04,049
exists today and we want to remove that

25
00:01:02,160 --> 00:01:06,899
and make it as seamless and streamlined

26
00:01:04,049 --> 00:01:08,220
as possible so that's really you know

27
00:01:06,900 --> 00:01:10,290
what we talked about shifting left it's

28
00:01:08,220 --> 00:01:12,689
like okay let's bring security which is

29
00:01:10,290 --> 00:01:14,310
arguably always been to the far right of

30
00:01:12,689 --> 00:01:17,250
the process and kind of an outsider or

31
00:01:14,310 --> 00:01:19,560
gate how do we bring them in and once

32
00:01:17,250 --> 00:01:21,750
again create this culture of def sec ops

33
00:01:19,560 --> 00:01:25,229
this was just why we're here at Def Con

34
00:01:21,750 --> 00:01:28,259
and and really make collaboration key

35
00:01:25,229 --> 00:01:30,299
and and have security have more of an

36
00:01:28,259 --> 00:01:32,750
engineering centric mindset and have

37
00:01:30,299 --> 00:01:35,520
developers start building awareness of

38
00:01:32,750 --> 00:01:38,340
you know the sequel injection attacks

39
00:01:35,520 --> 00:01:39,899
kind of the OWASP top 10 like arguably

40
00:01:38,340 --> 00:01:41,939
developers haven't gotten that much

41
00:01:39,900 --> 00:01:44,189
better about writing Sahira code or we

42
00:01:41,939 --> 00:01:46,829
we still see the same vulnerabilities

43
00:01:44,189 --> 00:01:49,079
how do we start like measuring that to

44
00:01:46,829 --> 00:01:51,508
use a DevOps you know core tenet term

45
00:01:49,079 --> 00:01:53,880
and improving upon that versus beating

46
00:01:51,509 --> 00:01:59,070
people up or pointing fingers which is

47
00:01:53,880 --> 00:02:00,839
once again that that cultural chasm so I

48
00:01:59,070 --> 00:02:02,969
don't like to put a bunch of statistics

49
00:02:00,840 --> 00:02:05,189
in because we can all find different

50
00:02:02,969 --> 00:02:07,890
charts and in different numbers but you

51
00:02:05,189 --> 00:02:10,139
know the benefits of early testing by

52
00:02:07,890 --> 00:02:12,959
shifting left it is pretty well

53
00:02:10,139 --> 00:02:13,829
publicized and here's one from a study

54
00:02:12,959 --> 00:02:15,180
from IBM

55
00:02:13,830 --> 00:02:17,490
that really talks about the relative

56
00:02:15,180 --> 00:02:19,560
costs so if I think about building in

57
00:02:17,490 --> 00:02:22,200
security assurance at the divine design

58
00:02:19,560 --> 00:02:23,310
phase and implementation and I forgot

59
00:02:22,200 --> 00:02:25,019
the previous speaker talking about

60
00:02:23,310 --> 00:02:27,570
architecture and thinking about

61
00:02:25,020 --> 00:02:30,030
architectural design with respect to

62
00:02:27,570 --> 00:02:32,280
security like you gain a lot of benefit

63
00:02:30,030 --> 00:02:35,790
from that at the implementation side

64
00:02:32,280 --> 00:02:39,150
it's still relatively low cost testing

65
00:02:35,790 --> 00:02:41,100
you have some pain and some cost but you

66
00:02:39,150 --> 00:02:43,950
know once you're into production and

67
00:02:41,100 --> 00:02:47,040
maintenance getting security fixes and

68
00:02:43,950 --> 00:02:48,720
product defects to get prioritized over

69
00:02:47,040 --> 00:02:51,299
delivering new features is really

70
00:02:48,720 --> 00:02:53,820
difficult and I think that going back to

71
00:02:51,300 --> 00:02:56,100
what I said about inertia is really the

72
00:02:53,820 --> 00:02:58,530
problem we have in general with with a

73
00:02:56,100 --> 00:03:01,709
lot of systems whether they're quote

74
00:02:58,530 --> 00:03:05,220
unquote legacy or a greenfield it's

75
00:03:01,709 --> 00:03:06,660
still it's still not security is

76
00:03:05,220 --> 00:03:08,670
important but not a priorities

77
00:03:06,660 --> 00:03:11,370
unfortunate soundbite I've heard a lot

78
00:03:08,670 --> 00:03:13,140
from CIOs recently I'm sure that

79
00:03:11,370 --> 00:03:15,870
conversations probably shifting rapidly

80
00:03:13,140 --> 00:03:19,279
given the the massive breach that just

81
00:03:15,870 --> 00:03:21,150
happened but it still needs to be

82
00:03:19,280 --> 00:03:23,670
somewhere in the middle I don't think it

83
00:03:21,150 --> 00:03:25,170
has to be the one and only priority but

84
00:03:23,670 --> 00:03:30,720
it has to be thought of and thought of

85
00:03:25,170 --> 00:03:33,299
early and often and like I said like the

86
00:03:30,720 --> 00:03:35,730
same approach to this shift left testing

87
00:03:33,300 --> 00:03:39,360
versus QA and product defects really

88
00:03:35,730 --> 00:03:42,540
needs to be taken needed for security

89
00:03:39,360 --> 00:03:44,700
and taken into account so you know going

90
00:03:42,540 --> 00:03:47,100
through this a chart it's really like

91
00:03:44,700 --> 00:03:49,799
look what DevOps did for making

92
00:03:47,100 --> 00:03:52,680
development and operations much more

93
00:03:49,800 --> 00:03:54,510
seamless and you know there was a talk

94
00:03:52,680 --> 00:03:56,130
about like the ten top poster child from

95
00:03:54,510 --> 00:03:58,230
Caroline's talk earlier this morning

96
00:03:56,130 --> 00:04:00,570
like in Netflix we're deploying updates

97
00:03:58,230 --> 00:04:02,518
you know four hundred two thousand times

98
00:04:00,570 --> 00:04:04,980
a day so there's this continuous

99
00:04:02,519 --> 00:04:07,019
delivery model and security needs to be

100
00:04:04,980 --> 00:04:09,738
part of that instead of the after the

101
00:04:07,019 --> 00:04:12,840
fact because then you're always chasing

102
00:04:09,739 --> 00:04:14,810
and so you're always behind and then you

103
00:04:12,840 --> 00:04:17,668
have a very contentious conversation

104
00:04:14,810 --> 00:04:20,190
going back to culture again between

105
00:04:17,668 --> 00:04:22,079
security and development like series

106
00:04:20,190 --> 00:04:23,700
like you need to remediate this like no

107
00:04:22,079 --> 00:04:25,500
I need to get this feature out because

108
00:04:23,700 --> 00:04:29,430
we promised a customer or

109
00:04:25,500 --> 00:04:31,290
our consumers want it so we need to

110
00:04:29,430 --> 00:04:33,960
bring the two together and shift

111
00:04:31,290 --> 00:04:35,940
security left as you know as far left as

112
00:04:33,960 --> 00:04:38,489
possible it's part of our core thesis

113
00:04:35,940 --> 00:04:40,820
and make it part of that that feedback

114
00:04:38,490 --> 00:04:44,310
loop as well

115
00:04:40,820 --> 00:04:46,830
and I'll continue on I'm a big fan of

116
00:04:44,310 --> 00:04:49,170
Patrick Lencioni s work with things like

117
00:04:46,830 --> 00:04:52,890
the five dysfunctions of a team and the

118
00:04:49,170 --> 00:04:55,560
advantage and he talks about creating

119
00:04:52,890 --> 00:04:57,360
clarity communicating clarity and over

120
00:04:55,560 --> 00:04:59,250
communicating clarity so I'm going to

121
00:04:57,360 --> 00:05:02,550
over communicate the culture part of

122
00:04:59,250 --> 00:05:05,460
this and that culture is definitely the

123
00:05:02,550 --> 00:05:08,250
main barrier to change and I think the

124
00:05:05,460 --> 00:05:10,380
the the meme there is because that's the

125
00:05:08,250 --> 00:05:12,180
way we've always done things and that is

126
00:05:10,380 --> 00:05:14,250
the fastest route for your company to

127
00:05:12,180 --> 00:05:17,370
become an incumbent or have a major

128
00:05:14,250 --> 00:05:19,169
security breach or get disrupted by a

129
00:05:17,370 --> 00:05:21,870
new innovative company whether you think

130
00:05:19,169 --> 00:05:23,909
about blockbuster Netflix you think

131
00:05:21,870 --> 00:05:26,070
about what Amazon is doing to literally

132
00:05:23,910 --> 00:05:29,270
every part of the industries whether

133
00:05:26,070 --> 00:05:33,240
it's the the food industry shipping

134
00:05:29,270 --> 00:05:35,490
ecommerce etc so you really have to

135
00:05:33,240 --> 00:05:38,400
think about what do we need to do

136
00:05:35,490 --> 00:05:43,470
culturally to adopt new technology and

137
00:05:38,400 --> 00:05:45,960
keep continually evolving and the big

138
00:05:43,470 --> 00:05:49,560
cultural challenge between DevOps and

139
00:05:45,960 --> 00:05:51,150
and sec ops of old is you know like the

140
00:05:49,560 --> 00:05:53,310
phrase mind the gap which I think

141
00:05:51,150 --> 00:05:57,330
Francois will probably probably resonate

142
00:05:53,310 --> 00:05:59,550
with him most is like how do we how do

143
00:05:57,330 --> 00:06:01,169
we close that chasm between the two and

144
00:05:59,550 --> 00:06:04,169
get them communicating which is the

145
00:06:01,169 --> 00:06:06,390
cultural barrier once again and you know

146
00:06:04,169 --> 00:06:08,700
we we also talk a lot in the industry

147
00:06:06,390 --> 00:06:11,190
about the well known cyber security

148
00:06:08,700 --> 00:06:14,039
talent shortage and we can't keep trying

149
00:06:11,190 --> 00:06:15,690
to scale out human capital so so how do

150
00:06:14,040 --> 00:06:18,270
we do that how do we how do we buffer

151
00:06:15,690 --> 00:06:20,969
that and make up for that severe talent

152
00:06:18,270 --> 00:06:23,250
shortage and all these manual approaches

153
00:06:20,970 --> 00:06:25,530
and I think our core thesis again is

154
00:06:23,250 --> 00:06:27,419
automation and orchestration where

155
00:06:25,530 --> 00:06:30,150
automation handles the vertically

156
00:06:27,419 --> 00:06:32,190
focused tasks and orchestration takes

157
00:06:30,150 --> 00:06:34,380
the processes across those tasks and

158
00:06:32,190 --> 00:06:36,750
correlates it so if you think about the

159
00:06:34,380 --> 00:06:39,270
SDLC from code commit application

160
00:06:36,750 --> 00:06:41,160
delivery how do we bring security test

161
00:06:39,270 --> 00:06:43,890
into that instead of these one-off

162
00:06:41,160 --> 00:06:46,470
processes where we say like okay on

163
00:06:43,890 --> 00:06:49,680
Tuesday Nancy will run our static code

164
00:06:46,470 --> 00:06:51,540
analysis tool and every other Saturday

165
00:06:49,680 --> 00:06:54,270
night at 2:00 a.m. Bob will run some

166
00:06:51,540 --> 00:06:56,580
dynamic pen testing tool but neither of

167
00:06:54,270 --> 00:06:59,219
those results are typically not

168
00:06:56,580 --> 00:07:01,740
correlated and they're always behind so

169
00:06:59,220 --> 00:07:04,350
how do we get that into that DevOps see

170
00:07:01,740 --> 00:07:08,970
ICD pipeline and get that closed

171
00:07:04,350 --> 00:07:10,620
feedback model and so this the

172
00:07:08,970 --> 00:07:12,600
collaboration and the cultural change

173
00:07:10,620 --> 00:07:15,300
that I talked about really starts with

174
00:07:12,600 --> 00:07:17,910
why and like I said there's the this

175
00:07:15,300 --> 00:07:20,220
well-known we we can take we love and

176
00:07:17,910 --> 00:07:22,500
the press also love to talk about the

177
00:07:20,220 --> 00:07:24,120
shortage of cyber talent but we don't

178
00:07:22,500 --> 00:07:25,920
like to talk or we don't seem to like to

179
00:07:24,120 --> 00:07:29,100
talk about what are the solutions to

180
00:07:25,920 --> 00:07:31,800
that and then adding to that is the

181
00:07:29,100 --> 00:07:33,540
security tool sprawl for those of you

182
00:07:31,800 --> 00:07:35,550
that go to the RSA Conference for

183
00:07:33,540 --> 00:07:37,530
example and you walk the floor I mean

184
00:07:35,550 --> 00:07:39,090
there's literally thousands of different

185
00:07:37,530 --> 00:07:40,650
tools kind of all have the same

186
00:07:39,090 --> 00:07:43,169
description whether they do the same

187
00:07:40,650 --> 00:07:45,450
thing or not and they're really taking

188
00:07:43,170 --> 00:07:48,150
very vertically focused kind of myopic

189
00:07:45,450 --> 00:07:50,400
views approach this without the

190
00:07:48,150 --> 00:07:52,650
correlation and this comprehensive

191
00:07:50,400 --> 00:07:54,840
visibility which should I talk about in

192
00:07:52,650 --> 00:07:57,419
the lack of visibility and then layering

193
00:07:54,840 --> 00:08:00,510
on this is the changing regulations were

194
00:07:57,420 --> 00:08:02,670
on a minor front you have the the

195
00:08:00,510 --> 00:08:05,400
updated PCI the payment cards if you're

196
00:08:02,670 --> 00:08:07,830
processing credit cards you you used to

197
00:08:05,400 --> 00:08:10,500
have to do it a pen test scan once a

198
00:08:07,830 --> 00:08:12,359
year now it's twice but if you think

199
00:08:10,500 --> 00:08:14,970
about hackers are can attack in your

200
00:08:12,360 --> 00:08:17,100
billing and payment system continuously

201
00:08:14,970 --> 00:08:18,690
does that really move the needle like

202
00:08:17,100 --> 00:08:21,600
that Netflix I was responsible for

203
00:08:18,690 --> 00:08:24,600
roughly 50 million credit cards and we

204
00:08:21,600 --> 00:08:26,340
had to do the PCI scan once a year so we

205
00:08:24,600 --> 00:08:27,840
get the big report I'd go have a

206
00:08:26,340 --> 00:08:30,239
contentious conversation with

207
00:08:27,840 --> 00:08:33,030
development they would get upset they

208
00:08:30,240 --> 00:08:34,740
say we already remediated this I put

209
00:08:33,030 --> 00:08:38,669
some mitigating controls in a place we

210
00:08:34,740 --> 00:08:40,590
compromised I talked to the qsa and a

211
00:08:38,669 --> 00:08:43,559
you know a month goes by I write a large

212
00:08:40,590 --> 00:08:45,360
check to get the certification we get it

213
00:08:43,559 --> 00:08:45,810
all done and wrapped up I talk to the

214
00:08:45,360 --> 00:08:48,480
board

215
00:08:45,810 --> 00:08:50,339
meanwhile the developers are making like

216
00:08:48,480 --> 00:08:53,160
I said before hundreds of changes per

217
00:08:50,340 --> 00:08:55,920
day so now I've signed off on this my

218
00:08:53,160 --> 00:08:58,920
neck is on the line the company's neck

219
00:08:55,920 --> 00:09:00,389
is on the line and we can make a change

220
00:08:58,920 --> 00:09:03,149
that makes us vulnerable and it's good

221
00:09:00,389 --> 00:09:05,279
for a year like that that is mean to me

222
00:09:03,149 --> 00:09:08,279
that seems severely broken and I think

223
00:09:05,279 --> 00:09:10,610
we need to change some regulations last

224
00:09:08,279 --> 00:09:12,810
March there were some new financial ones

225
00:09:10,610 --> 00:09:15,569
regulations that want to effect in the

226
00:09:12,810 --> 00:09:18,660
state of New York that any significant

227
00:09:15,569 --> 00:09:20,069
change if you're handling if your assets

228
00:09:18,660 --> 00:09:22,620
were above a certain amount I think was

229
00:09:20,069 --> 00:09:24,870
ten billion that you had to do a scan or

230
00:09:22,620 --> 00:09:26,759
a pen test but there's no one really

231
00:09:24,870 --> 00:09:28,470
monitoring that there's no there's no

232
00:09:26,759 --> 00:09:31,589
solution on this this is kind of a

233
00:09:28,470 --> 00:09:33,870
arbitrary mandate and now with the

234
00:09:31,589 --> 00:09:35,939
forthcoming GDP are so the general data

235
00:09:33,870 --> 00:09:38,129
protection regulations going in effect

236
00:09:35,939 --> 00:09:40,050
in the EU I believe it's next May

237
00:09:38,129 --> 00:09:42,389
there's a lot of fear uncertainty and

238
00:09:40,050 --> 00:09:43,920
doubt around that or like okay now how

239
00:09:42,389 --> 00:09:46,500
do we manage our data do we give

240
00:09:43,920 --> 00:09:49,079
consumers more control over it you know

241
00:09:46,500 --> 00:09:51,540
how do we like put this hard perimeter

242
00:09:49,079 --> 00:09:54,479
around what is now a perimeter less

243
00:09:51,540 --> 00:09:58,189
world so I think the regulations are not

244
00:09:54,480 --> 00:10:00,420
helping this and then last but not least

245
00:09:58,189 --> 00:10:02,069
security Colette's again especially

246
00:10:00,420 --> 00:10:03,930
after last week is definitely going to

247
00:10:02,069 --> 00:10:06,750
be a board level or CEO level

248
00:10:03,930 --> 00:10:10,638
conversation and how do you go present

249
00:10:06,750 --> 00:10:14,279
what our true risk posture is to them in

250
00:10:10,639 --> 00:10:15,839
in terms that you know are that they can

251
00:10:14,279 --> 00:10:18,269
understand and relate to the business

252
00:10:15,839 --> 00:10:21,209
and how it affects the business without

253
00:10:18,269 --> 00:10:22,889
scaring them or without lying to them

254
00:10:21,209 --> 00:10:24,719
and saying everything's fun we have all

255
00:10:22,889 --> 00:10:27,480
this in place because we have a next-gen

256
00:10:24,720 --> 00:10:29,610
firewall for example like we have to

257
00:10:27,480 --> 00:10:31,199
have a common strategic framework to

258
00:10:29,610 --> 00:10:33,480
build upon and be able to communicate

259
00:10:31,199 --> 00:10:36,540
that which is back to the collaborative

260
00:10:33,480 --> 00:10:39,449
culture and security needs to to be

261
00:10:36,540 --> 00:10:41,189
involved early and be implicit in the

262
00:10:39,449 --> 00:10:42,719
development lifecycle and I think I can

263
00:10:41,189 --> 00:10:45,990
I don't think I can emphasize that

264
00:10:42,720 --> 00:10:49,199
enough like security is important and

265
00:10:45,990 --> 00:10:51,480
not a priority it should be both and and

266
00:10:49,199 --> 00:10:56,430
companies need to be accountable for

267
00:10:51,480 --> 00:10:59,399
this so like I mentioned it's it's

268
00:10:56,430 --> 00:11:02,219
really about how do we step back and

269
00:10:59,399 --> 00:11:03,930
outline a strategic framework and I

270
00:11:02,220 --> 00:11:05,939
think some of the ways I think about it

271
00:11:03,930 --> 00:11:06,839
I think you can't secure what you don't

272
00:11:05,939 --> 00:11:08,040
know about

273
00:11:06,840 --> 00:11:10,440
so you really have to take a

274
00:11:08,040 --> 00:11:12,420
comprehensive inventory and given

275
00:11:10,440 --> 00:11:14,220
today's kind of cloud first ephemeral

276
00:11:12,420 --> 00:11:16,829
nature that inventory is always going to

277
00:11:14,220 --> 00:11:18,300
be changing but you have to take someone

278
00:11:16,830 --> 00:11:21,000
you know you have to get some point in

279
00:11:18,300 --> 00:11:23,400
time copy of of where your code

280
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:26,100
repositories are I met with the CIO of a

281
00:11:23,400 --> 00:11:28,709
large firm recently and he's like look I

282
00:11:26,100 --> 00:11:31,650
have we have developers using github we

283
00:11:28,710 --> 00:11:33,930
have perforce we have some other on-prem

284
00:11:31,650 --> 00:11:35,400
one and I think we have some others that

285
00:11:33,930 --> 00:11:38,430
I don't know about like I don't even

286
00:11:35,400 --> 00:11:39,750
know where my code lives so if you don't

287
00:11:38,430 --> 00:11:41,939
know where your code repositories live

288
00:11:39,750 --> 00:11:44,010
you certainly can't start doing static

289
00:11:41,940 --> 00:11:49,080
code analysis or source code composition

290
00:11:44,010 --> 00:11:50,700
analysis and then often unless you're in

291
00:11:49,080 --> 00:11:53,279
this kind of DevOps first cloud first

292
00:11:50,700 --> 00:11:55,980
model you don't you don't have one build

293
00:11:53,279 --> 00:11:59,310
system you know you may have cloudBees

294
00:11:55,980 --> 00:12:00,750
or jenkins you may have some old put

295
00:11:59,310 --> 00:12:03,390
together a pipeline you may still use

296
00:12:00,750 --> 00:12:05,850
common make files and and the kabbalists

297
00:12:03,390 --> 00:12:08,430
together with with the old school system

298
00:12:05,850 --> 00:12:10,529
in but you really have to get a handle

299
00:12:08,430 --> 00:12:11,609
on what that is and then figure out like

300
00:12:10,529 --> 00:12:13,860
what's what's the current state and

301
00:12:11,610 --> 00:12:15,150
what's the future state and you really

302
00:12:13,860 --> 00:12:17,790
want to be able to converge those build

303
00:12:15,150 --> 00:12:22,199
systems over time onto one and so you

304
00:12:17,790 --> 00:12:23,490
have that that one barrier or or gates a

305
00:12:22,200 --> 00:12:26,580
deploy where you can provide the

306
00:12:23,490 --> 00:12:28,740
security assurance and then you know

307
00:12:26,580 --> 00:12:30,300
with what you know I call shadow cloud

308
00:12:28,740 --> 00:12:32,280
you have different application

309
00:12:30,300 --> 00:12:34,770
deployments once again I talked to a

310
00:12:32,280 --> 00:12:36,449
customer they have they have production

311
00:12:34,770 --> 00:12:38,970
applications or consumer facing

312
00:12:36,450 --> 00:12:42,830
applications in three public cloud

313
00:12:38,970 --> 00:12:45,300
providers to coalos and then an on-prem

314
00:12:42,830 --> 00:12:47,130
environment as well so like you think

315
00:12:45,300 --> 00:12:48,599
about the expansive nature of that and

316
00:12:47,130 --> 00:12:50,430
then you have different developers

317
00:12:48,600 --> 00:12:51,900
different build systems different code

318
00:12:50,430 --> 00:12:53,969
repositories and now different

319
00:12:51,900 --> 00:12:57,600
deployments that is a really hard

320
00:12:53,970 --> 00:13:00,540
perimeter to secure or just get a hold

321
00:12:57,600 --> 00:13:02,940
of so then it's okay once we have that

322
00:13:00,540 --> 00:13:04,349
assessment what do we do with it so now

323
00:13:02,940 --> 00:13:06,180
I've measured it how do I measure an

324
00:13:04,350 --> 00:13:08,339
improvement and what is the goal and get

325
00:13:06,180 --> 00:13:11,069
everybody in alignment with that which

326
00:13:08,339 --> 00:13:13,770
requires collaboration versus you know

327
00:13:11,070 --> 00:13:15,270
the contentious security team yelling at

328
00:13:13,770 --> 00:13:18,089
the development team or infrastructure

329
00:13:15,270 --> 00:13:20,010
teams or vice versa and nothing getting

330
00:13:18,089 --> 00:13:22,260
done

331
00:13:20,010 --> 00:13:25,140
and then once you have a handle on that

332
00:13:22,260 --> 00:13:26,730
and some sort of automated process how

333
00:13:25,140 --> 00:13:28,920
do you start performing your initial

334
00:13:26,730 --> 00:13:31,740
security tests and ideally you want to

335
00:13:28,920 --> 00:13:33,890
start at the far left with static code

336
00:13:31,740 --> 00:13:36,090
analysis and source code composition

337
00:13:33,890 --> 00:13:38,760
kind of in the middle of the artifact

338
00:13:36,090 --> 00:13:40,920
build with a open source and third-party

339
00:13:38,760 --> 00:13:43,260
library scanning and then at the far

340
00:13:40,920 --> 00:13:45,270
right doing dynamic pen testing a

341
00:13:43,260 --> 00:13:47,370
knapsack looking for the OWASP top ten

342
00:13:45,270 --> 00:13:49,980
and other common vulnerabilities and

343
00:13:47,370 --> 00:13:52,560
once you have that baseline how do you

344
00:13:49,980 --> 00:13:54,360
do that continuously so you're in sync

345
00:13:52,560 --> 00:13:56,579
with every every deployment that's

346
00:13:54,360 --> 00:13:58,620
significant or even every deployment how

347
00:13:56,580 --> 00:14:01,890
do we make sure we run the same battery

348
00:13:58,620 --> 00:14:04,640
of tests that is the same like if you

349
00:14:01,890 --> 00:14:07,230
rely on humans to do this continuously

350
00:14:04,640 --> 00:14:09,180
you will run into human configuration

351
00:14:07,230 --> 00:14:10,860
error like I I could be running a test

352
00:14:09,180 --> 00:14:12,359
and my wife calls me and says look you

353
00:14:10,860 --> 00:14:14,370
we have to go you have to pick up your

354
00:14:12,360 --> 00:14:16,200
son from soccer and so I stopped the

355
00:14:14,370 --> 00:14:19,140
test I figured I'll pick it up later I

356
00:14:16,200 --> 00:14:20,940
either don't or I skip a step there's

357
00:14:19,140 --> 00:14:22,080
just we're just always prone to human

358
00:14:20,940 --> 00:14:24,360
configuration their know-how

359
00:14:22,080 --> 00:14:26,460
no matter how smart anyone is we all

360
00:14:24,360 --> 00:14:28,290
make mistakes but if we can automate

361
00:14:26,460 --> 00:14:30,780
that and do it continuously and measure

362
00:14:28,290 --> 00:14:33,390
it it will move the needle significantly

363
00:14:30,780 --> 00:14:35,910
and this goes to what I stalk about

364
00:14:33,390 --> 00:14:39,060
automated testing and feedback loops so

365
00:14:35,910 --> 00:14:41,699
now you want to run this from if you

366
00:14:39,060 --> 00:14:43,890
think about the entire sdlc so now

367
00:14:41,700 --> 00:14:46,290
you've run the test at code commit build

368
00:14:43,890 --> 00:14:48,630
delivery and you have a feedback loop

369
00:14:46,290 --> 00:14:50,490
and there's this virtuous cycle of the

370
00:14:48,630 --> 00:14:52,380
correlated results versus like I

371
00:14:50,490 --> 00:14:54,630
mentioned before you know one person

372
00:14:52,380 --> 00:14:56,250
does the test here at this time another

373
00:14:54,630 --> 00:14:57,990
person does the test here at this time

374
00:14:56,250 --> 00:14:59,520
but they never talk to each other

375
00:14:57,990 --> 00:15:02,160
they're probably talking to different

376
00:14:59,520 --> 00:15:04,620
developers and they're not also driving

377
00:15:02,160 --> 00:15:06,480
developer awareness which goes back to

378
00:15:04,620 --> 00:15:08,040
the collaborative culture that we're

379
00:15:06,480 --> 00:15:13,980
trying to build with the notion of dev

380
00:15:08,040 --> 00:15:15,810
sec ops and you know you have to measure

381
00:15:13,980 --> 00:15:18,120
what is important I think there's a lot

382
00:15:15,810 --> 00:15:20,250
of metrics in every area that we can

383
00:15:18,120 --> 00:15:21,630
measure that they don't really matter to

384
00:15:20,250 --> 00:15:23,910
the business like you have to have a

385
00:15:21,630 --> 00:15:26,730
business first or revenue first mindset

386
00:15:23,910 --> 00:15:28,650
and in security a couple things we think

387
00:15:26,730 --> 00:15:31,830
about are what we call internal rate of

388
00:15:28,650 --> 00:15:33,699
detection so how soon or how quickly in

389
00:15:31,830 --> 00:15:35,829
the in the sdlc can we

390
00:15:33,699 --> 00:15:38,199
find a defect and then what's our

391
00:15:35,829 --> 00:15:41,439
internal rate of Romanian so how quickly

392
00:15:38,199 --> 00:15:43,660
can remediate that and if we don't we at

393
00:15:41,439 --> 00:15:46,059
least have time boxed our level of

394
00:15:43,660 --> 00:15:47,738
exposure so you know typically with a

395
00:15:46,059 --> 00:15:50,139
breach you're like well I think it would

396
00:15:47,739 --> 00:15:52,660
happened you know late last year early

397
00:15:50,139 --> 00:15:55,059
this year and now it you know we know

398
00:15:52,660 --> 00:15:56,259
what happened to here like like with if

399
00:15:55,059 --> 00:15:58,299
you keep track of this and measure

400
00:15:56,259 --> 00:16:00,519
properly you can definitely say look

401
00:15:58,299 --> 00:16:02,739
this vulnerability was exposed to

402
00:16:00,519 --> 00:16:04,299
production at this deployment and it was

403
00:16:02,739 --> 00:16:07,089
remediated to this one so you now know

404
00:16:04,299 --> 00:16:08,769
exactly the point in time were anything

405
00:16:07,089 --> 00:16:10,449
could happen and if you have proper

406
00:16:08,769 --> 00:16:13,540
logging and other metrics you can go

407
00:16:10,449 --> 00:16:15,699
back and and more definitively say what

408
00:16:13,540 --> 00:16:19,779
happened and what the potential exposure

409
00:16:15,699 --> 00:16:21,608
or risk to the company is and that

410
00:16:19,779 --> 00:16:24,279
visibility really should improve your

411
00:16:21,609 --> 00:16:26,589
overall resiliency where resiliency is

412
00:16:24,279 --> 00:16:29,230
how how quickly can you bounce back from

413
00:16:26,589 --> 00:16:31,569
from an adverse event to think about

414
00:16:29,230 --> 00:16:33,579
what Netflix has done with chaos monkey

415
00:16:31,569 --> 00:16:35,649
and security monkey they're constantly

416
00:16:33,579 --> 00:16:37,358
attacking their own infrastructure to

417
00:16:35,649 --> 00:16:39,669
make it more resilient so looking for

418
00:16:37,359 --> 00:16:41,169
those weak points and hackers are

419
00:16:39,669 --> 00:16:44,289
certainly doing this I mean whether

420
00:16:41,169 --> 00:16:46,689
they're sophisticated you know black

421
00:16:44,289 --> 00:16:49,689
hats or script kitties they're all using

422
00:16:46,689 --> 00:16:51,399
the same tools and unfortunately for us

423
00:16:49,689 --> 00:16:53,259
they only have to get this right once

424
00:16:51,399 --> 00:16:56,799
and we have to be right all of the time

425
00:16:53,259 --> 00:16:58,779
so and being right all the time it's not

426
00:16:56,799 --> 00:17:01,509
gonna happen if we're taking a periodic

427
00:16:58,779 --> 00:17:05,470
approach so we really have to as an

428
00:17:01,509 --> 00:17:08,620
industry or as a community of DevOps we

429
00:17:05,470 --> 00:17:10,480
have to take a continuous approach and

430
00:17:08,619 --> 00:17:12,309
we also want to start you know talking

431
00:17:10,480 --> 00:17:14,649
about measuring what matters let's start

432
00:17:12,309 --> 00:17:16,178
measuring improvement and over time

433
00:17:14,648 --> 00:17:18,219
hopefully we can start building

434
00:17:16,179 --> 00:17:21,089
developer awareness if we can provide

435
00:17:18,220 --> 00:17:23,409
better targeted remediation advice

436
00:17:21,089 --> 00:17:26,260
hopefully they start learning and say oh

437
00:17:23,409 --> 00:17:28,750
I know I'm writing this input balance

438
00:17:26,260 --> 00:17:31,720
checker for this web forum I made this

439
00:17:28,750 --> 00:17:34,570
mistake last time now I won't make that

440
00:17:31,720 --> 00:17:35,980
same mistake again and you're like I

441
00:17:34,570 --> 00:17:37,600
don't think that's happening today

442
00:17:35,980 --> 00:17:40,179
because there isn't a great feedback

443
00:17:37,600 --> 00:17:42,459
loop so we need to tighten that up and

444
00:17:40,179 --> 00:17:45,210
and that goes back to once again the

445
00:17:42,460 --> 00:17:45,210
collaborative culture

446
00:17:47,610 --> 00:17:50,740
[Music]

447
00:17:54,790 --> 00:18:02,539
half is here increasing

448
00:17:58,860 --> 00:18:02,539
in x-ray or

449
00:18:03,390 --> 00:18:07,510
there was a report called the state of

450
00:18:05,679 --> 00:18:08,950
the software supply chain and I cannot

451
00:18:07,510 --> 00:18:10,450
remember who published it but I think

452
00:18:08,950 --> 00:18:14,230
there's some really good metrics in that

453
00:18:10,450 --> 00:18:17,169
report that that that that talked about

454
00:18:14,230 --> 00:18:18,789
this and and as a company over time is

455
00:18:17,169 --> 00:18:20,559
you know given our early startup stage

456
00:18:18,789 --> 00:18:22,779
we hope that provide those metrics back

457
00:18:20,559 --> 00:18:27,639
to the community of what our customers

458
00:18:22,779 --> 00:18:29,049
are seeing but check out the state of

459
00:18:27,640 --> 00:18:34,539
software supply chain I think there's

460
00:18:29,049 --> 00:18:36,429
some good validation in that so I've

461
00:18:34,539 --> 00:18:38,080
talked a lot about the Y and culture and

462
00:18:36,429 --> 00:18:42,730
I'll go into a little bit about the how

463
00:18:38,080 --> 00:18:44,529
and what we talk about is you know you

464
00:18:42,730 --> 00:18:46,390
can't you can't do everything all at

465
00:18:44,529 --> 00:18:48,250
once like okay like I don't have a

466
00:18:46,390 --> 00:18:51,100
strategic framework in place where do I

467
00:18:48,250 --> 00:18:53,289
start like you can start at any point of

468
00:18:51,100 --> 00:18:55,990
the sdlc you want I think an easy places

469
00:18:53,289 --> 00:18:58,419
do is start right and then shift left

470
00:18:55,990 --> 00:19:00,159
over time like more more and more

471
00:18:58,419 --> 00:19:02,289
companies and security engineers are

472
00:19:00,159 --> 00:19:04,240
familiar with dynamic pen testing or app

473
00:19:02,289 --> 00:19:07,450
SEC testing and that's at the far right

474
00:19:04,240 --> 00:19:09,880
so start there and get that baseline of

475
00:19:07,450 --> 00:19:12,100
your application and then you know bring

476
00:19:09,880 --> 00:19:13,750
that in to maybe start then at whatever

477
00:19:12,100 --> 00:19:15,760
build system you're using whether it's

478
00:19:13,750 --> 00:19:18,250
Jenkins Travis you'll name your your

479
00:19:15,760 --> 00:19:20,260
favorite CI a-- tool like how do i look

480
00:19:18,250 --> 00:19:22,480
for open source and third-party library

481
00:19:20,260 --> 00:19:24,309
vulnerabilities at that stage and start

482
00:19:22,480 --> 00:19:26,529
correlating that with the dynamic the

483
00:19:24,309 --> 00:19:28,510
pen testing and then as you get

484
00:19:26,529 --> 00:19:31,690
sophisticated around then a good

485
00:19:28,510 --> 00:19:33,460
workflow go to the further left and at

486
00:19:31,690 --> 00:19:36,100
code commit now i can run a scan

487
00:19:33,460 --> 00:19:38,309
depending on the language and i can give

488
00:19:36,100 --> 00:19:41,139
developers more immediate feedback so

489
00:19:38,309 --> 00:19:43,450
literally anytime a commit happens to a

490
00:19:41,140 --> 00:19:45,549
repo you can give them you can run a

491
00:19:43,450 --> 00:19:49,870
tool and give them targeted remediation

492
00:19:45,549 --> 00:19:51,700
advice so they get interrupted but that

493
00:19:49,870 --> 00:19:53,110
those interrupts are hopefully quick

494
00:19:51,700 --> 00:19:56,230
hopefully they're learning from them and

495
00:19:53,110 --> 00:19:58,330
they have less to remediate versus like

496
00:19:56,230 --> 00:20:00,700
i talked about the yearly pci audit

497
00:19:58,330 --> 00:20:02,529
where you have literally a 50 page PDF

498
00:20:00,700 --> 00:20:04,539
report of a litany of issues to

499
00:20:02,529 --> 00:20:08,380
remediate which is not a fun

500
00:20:04,539 --> 00:20:10,299
conversation to have and that once again

501
00:20:08,380 --> 00:20:13,360
really the correlation and visibility

502
00:20:10,299 --> 00:20:16,418
like the visibility is I think always

503
00:20:13,360 --> 00:20:16,689
lacking in security it's not like a lot

504
00:20:16,419 --> 00:20:18,280
of

505
00:20:16,690 --> 00:20:20,200
companies think about it they think

506
00:20:18,280 --> 00:20:22,330
about like the little appointment time

507
00:20:20,200 --> 00:20:24,610
testing they've done versus the

508
00:20:22,330 --> 00:20:26,230
comprehensive visibility of the lineage

509
00:20:24,610 --> 00:20:29,830
of an application or suite of

510
00:20:26,230 --> 00:20:30,870
applications and you know as you shift

511
00:20:29,830 --> 00:20:33,730
left

512
00:20:30,870 --> 00:20:36,879
hopefully that increases collaboration

513
00:20:33,730 --> 00:20:40,870
between sac ops and DevOps and brings

514
00:20:36,880 --> 00:20:44,440
this concept or culture of dev suck-ups

515
00:20:40,870 --> 00:20:46,629
to reality and that dev sac ops B is the

516
00:20:44,440 --> 00:20:48,340
new DevOps and we don't ever talk about

517
00:20:46,630 --> 00:20:54,600
just DevOps again security is always

518
00:20:48,340 --> 00:20:57,639
part of that and so the what so this is

519
00:20:54,600 --> 00:20:59,620
getting to the culture of dev sec ops

520
00:20:57,640 --> 00:21:02,710
it's a continuous journey it's not a

521
00:20:59,620 --> 00:21:06,280
destination you can never say you know

522
00:21:02,710 --> 00:21:07,870
ok we did this we're done there you can

523
00:21:06,280 --> 00:21:10,510
always be improving you can always

524
00:21:07,870 --> 00:21:13,629
figure out like better ways to test how

525
00:21:10,510 --> 00:21:17,110
how to extract the signal from the noise

526
00:21:13,630 --> 00:21:19,180
better of the different tools how to get

527
00:21:17,110 --> 00:21:21,520
tighter feedback loops you learn what is

528
00:21:19,180 --> 00:21:24,070
important to measure and why and present

529
00:21:21,520 --> 00:21:26,320
that in a good dashboard that if you're

530
00:21:24,070 --> 00:21:29,169
the CIO or C so you can go to the CEO on

531
00:21:26,320 --> 00:21:31,870
board and much more confidently report

532
00:21:29,170 --> 00:21:34,530
like here's our true security and risk

533
00:21:31,870 --> 00:21:37,060
posture and how resilient we are and

534
00:21:34,530 --> 00:21:38,920
where we are on the risk profile if

535
00:21:37,060 --> 00:21:42,220
something does happen in the impact of

536
00:21:38,920 --> 00:21:44,830
the business and and it's really about

537
00:21:42,220 --> 00:21:47,680
delivering continuous security assurance

538
00:21:44,830 --> 00:21:50,679
I think if you look at cyber insurance

539
00:21:47,680 --> 00:21:53,560
premiums vs. what gets paid out during a

540
00:21:50,680 --> 00:21:55,240
breach personally not a fan of insurance

541
00:21:53,560 --> 00:21:57,909
in general but I don't think cyber

542
00:21:55,240 --> 00:22:01,330
insurance ever really covers the

543
00:21:57,910 --> 00:22:05,320
reputational hit let alone the financial

544
00:22:01,330 --> 00:22:08,379
hit of a major breach and it really has

545
00:22:05,320 --> 00:22:11,290
to be this this methodology overlay into

546
00:22:08,380 --> 00:22:12,820
the entire CIC D pipeline like you can't

547
00:22:11,290 --> 00:22:15,250
think about it as okay I'm gonna use

548
00:22:12,820 --> 00:22:17,290
this tool here this tool here it really

549
00:22:15,250 --> 00:22:19,240
has to be an implicit overlay or

550
00:22:17,290 --> 00:22:22,389
underlay depending on your view of the

551
00:22:19,240 --> 00:22:25,840
world or as we call sometimes a fabric

552
00:22:22,390 --> 00:22:28,690
but you have to not you have to not

553
00:22:25,840 --> 00:22:30,100
impede development and velocity but you

554
00:22:28,690 --> 00:22:31,780
have to be

555
00:22:30,100 --> 00:22:35,889
extremely additive to the security

556
00:22:31,780 --> 00:22:38,050
testing so like I said I really wanted

557
00:22:35,890 --> 00:22:41,020
to make this you know more of a Q&A

558
00:22:38,050 --> 00:22:43,090
session about what challenges people are

559
00:22:41,020 --> 00:22:46,120
having you know what's working what's

560
00:22:43,090 --> 00:22:50,080
not working like how do you think about

561
00:22:46,120 --> 00:23:21,489
starting any like how do the

562
00:22:50,080 --> 00:23:22,629
conversations go on I think the first

563
00:23:21,490 --> 00:23:23,770
thing you have to do when you do that

564
00:23:22,630 --> 00:23:27,400
what I talked about the initial

565
00:23:23,770 --> 00:23:29,860
inventory is a lot of these tools are

566
00:23:27,400 --> 00:23:31,120
really chatty and I especially like the

567
00:23:29,860 --> 00:23:33,310
open source stuff there's there's no

568
00:23:31,120 --> 00:23:34,959
bounds on it so you you can't just take

569
00:23:33,310 --> 00:23:36,909
that and give it to development expect

570
00:23:34,960 --> 00:23:38,890
them to extract that signal from the

571
00:23:36,910 --> 00:23:41,230
noise so you have to invest some time

572
00:23:38,890 --> 00:23:43,930
upfront to figure out like what is a

573
00:23:41,230 --> 00:23:46,930
true vulnerability and prioritize them

574
00:23:43,930 --> 00:23:50,110
and kind of game the system a little bit

575
00:23:46,930 --> 00:23:53,080
by giving them like better targeted

576
00:23:50,110 --> 00:23:54,580
remediation of ice to get them used to

577
00:23:53,080 --> 00:23:56,500
the process but I think that's that's

578
00:23:54,580 --> 00:24:00,790
like the the initial investment that

579
00:23:56,500 --> 00:24:05,020
needs to happen because if you just give

580
00:24:00,790 --> 00:24:06,580
them a big PDF or or text report that's

581
00:24:05,020 --> 00:24:10,050
not gonna move the needle it's not gonna

582
00:24:06,580 --> 00:24:10,050
start you on this journey

583
00:24:15,900 --> 00:24:23,699
[Music]

584
00:24:41,170 --> 00:24:46,850
so the approach we've taken is is really

585
00:24:44,150 --> 00:24:48,950
writing this normalization layer so each

586
00:24:46,850 --> 00:24:51,080
tool finds different vulnerabilities or

587
00:24:48,950 --> 00:24:53,990
presents them a different way so how do

588
00:24:51,080 --> 00:24:56,540
you take the strongest signal from that

589
00:24:53,990 --> 00:24:59,540
and normalize that and present a common

590
00:24:56,540 --> 00:25:01,340
output and in trying to hopefully come

591
00:24:59,540 --> 00:25:02,510
up with a standard I think Kevin

592
00:25:01,340 --> 00:25:04,909
mentioned that this morning that

593
00:25:02,510 --> 00:25:06,920
Microsoft's working on this but I think

594
00:25:04,910 --> 00:25:09,500
that's what needs to happen like you

595
00:25:06,920 --> 00:25:11,090
can't just say and now you cuz we can

596
00:25:09,500 --> 00:25:12,980
start comparing different tools and

597
00:25:11,090 --> 00:25:15,500
figure out in your environment given

598
00:25:12,980 --> 00:25:18,560
your language or your deployment which

599
00:25:15,500 --> 00:25:20,570
one finds better results or maybe the

600
00:25:18,560 --> 00:25:22,550
combination of these to work really well

601
00:25:20,570 --> 00:25:25,639
so there's some a B testing that goes

602
00:25:22,550 --> 00:25:27,830
into this also which you know hopefully

603
00:25:25,640 --> 00:25:29,900
the a/b testing once again creates more

604
00:25:27,830 --> 00:25:33,169
collaboration it gets people talking and

605
00:25:29,900 --> 00:25:34,550
getting input and that development feels

606
00:25:33,170 --> 00:25:37,250
like they're part of this decision

607
00:25:34,550 --> 00:25:39,610
process as well and they say look tool X

608
00:25:37,250 --> 00:25:42,260
is working better for us than tool Y and

609
00:25:39,610 --> 00:25:45,219
I feel like overall we have better

610
00:25:42,260 --> 00:25:45,220
security assurance

611
00:25:54,410 --> 00:25:58,620
good question so a mutable

612
00:25:56,490 --> 00:26:01,080
infrastructure the move to microservices

613
00:25:58,620 --> 00:26:04,949
containerized environment I think the

614
00:26:01,080 --> 00:26:06,570
way to started in inventory is do one

615
00:26:04,950 --> 00:26:08,340
deployment of that and take take a

616
00:26:06,570 --> 00:26:10,830
snapshot and that should give you a good

617
00:26:08,340 --> 00:26:12,899
baseline and then as that changes you

618
00:26:10,830 --> 00:26:15,210
want to monitor those changes and if

619
00:26:12,900 --> 00:26:17,280
there's extreme anomalies like ok

620
00:26:15,210 --> 00:26:19,170
typically I have you know an hundred

621
00:26:17,280 --> 00:26:21,899
containers running in this this

622
00:26:19,170 --> 00:26:24,030
environment and now I have you know 2x

623
00:26:21,900 --> 00:26:25,740
or 3x set there's something strange I

624
00:26:24,030 --> 00:26:27,420
should go look at that and I think you

625
00:26:25,740 --> 00:26:29,460
know that goes back to visibility so you

626
00:26:27,420 --> 00:26:32,040
know some CIOs are moving applications

627
00:26:29,460 --> 00:26:33,570
from on-prem to cloud they like oh yeah

628
00:26:32,040 --> 00:26:35,730
I think I had you know I whatever how

629
00:26:33,570 --> 00:26:38,909
many bare-metal servers I think I have

630
00:26:35,730 --> 00:26:41,760
40 ec2 instances in Amazon turns out

631
00:26:38,910 --> 00:26:44,220
they have 400 so outside of the

632
00:26:41,760 --> 00:26:45,990
potential cost implications of that like

633
00:26:44,220 --> 00:26:47,880
the likelihood of human configuration

634
00:26:45,990 --> 00:26:50,760
error messing up a security group for

635
00:26:47,880 --> 00:26:52,230
example is pretty high and so you can't

636
00:26:50,760 --> 00:26:54,180
secure what you don't know about and if

637
00:26:52,230 --> 00:26:57,540
you have 10x the instances that you

638
00:26:54,180 --> 00:27:00,240
think so then it's like okay how do I

639
00:26:57,540 --> 00:27:01,980
have a workflow engine around my micro

640
00:27:00,240 --> 00:27:04,260
service architecture and how do I deploy

641
00:27:01,980 --> 00:27:08,760
to that and making sure that I have some

642
00:27:04,260 --> 00:27:11,240
checks and balances in that without

643
00:27:08,760 --> 00:27:11,240
slowing it down

644
00:27:18,510 --> 00:27:23,290
does that leads and arrows to take

645
00:27:21,190 --> 00:27:28,360
ownership of all the security tools

646
00:27:23,290 --> 00:27:30,220
going into the pipeline so I think

647
00:27:28,360 --> 00:27:33,790
that's what I described as the overlay

648
00:27:30,220 --> 00:27:36,790
that security teams need to be overlaid

649
00:27:33,790 --> 00:27:38,649
into all of the these build pipelines so

650
00:27:36,790 --> 00:27:40,090
you if you have different application

651
00:27:38,650 --> 00:27:42,250
deployments security needs to be

652
00:27:40,090 --> 00:27:44,919
involved in all of those but you can't

653
00:27:42,250 --> 00:27:46,960
put the onus on those those existing

654
00:27:44,920 --> 00:27:49,000
teams they're not going to care about

655
00:27:46,960 --> 00:27:51,850
security so you have to have the right

656
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:53,470
overall security infrastructure team to

657
00:27:51,850 --> 00:27:55,600
handle that and be able to ski and have

658
00:27:53,470 --> 00:28:19,750
enough to scale out with leveraging

659
00:27:55,600 --> 00:28:22,000
automation and orchestration so without

660
00:28:19,750 --> 00:28:23,830
giving too much of a vendor pitch so the

661
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:27,280
platform we've architected if you're an

662
00:28:23,830 --> 00:28:28,990
Amazon as part of the pipeline before

663
00:28:27,280 --> 00:28:31,510
you do a production deployment we

664
00:28:28,990 --> 00:28:33,250
replicate your VPC and Amazon speak and

665
00:28:31,510 --> 00:28:34,990
spin up the application and deliver

666
00:28:33,250 --> 00:28:38,170
updates to that and aggressively scan

667
00:28:34,990 --> 00:28:39,850
against that ephemeral clone so now if

668
00:28:38,170 --> 00:28:42,580
we're successful with a sequel injection

669
00:28:39,850 --> 00:28:44,889
attack and corrupt your database it

670
00:28:42,580 --> 00:28:47,080
doesn't matter because it wasn't

671
00:28:44,890 --> 00:28:49,090
production so like that's like if you

672
00:28:47,080 --> 00:28:52,570
think about the old days of waterfall in

673
00:28:49,090 --> 00:28:54,730
a QA environment this is the the dev sec

674
00:28:52,570 --> 00:28:57,310
ops version of that just automated an

675
00:28:54,730 --> 00:28:59,500
orchestrated as part of the pipeline

676
00:28:57,310 --> 00:29:02,609
[Music]

677
00:28:59,500 --> 00:29:02,609
[Applause]

678
00:29:08,140 --> 00:29:12,620
so I think that goes back to what I

679
00:29:11,030 --> 00:29:14,930
talked a little bit about measuring and

680
00:29:12,620 --> 00:29:16,790
I think your your sock or suck ups needs

681
00:29:14,930 --> 00:29:21,080
to understand what you're measuring and

682
00:29:16,790 --> 00:29:22,730
why and be part of that so so loosely

683
00:29:21,080 --> 00:29:25,040
coupled but still it more deeply

684
00:29:22,730 --> 00:29:28,910
involved into the deployment process and

685
00:29:25,040 --> 00:29:31,129
and the sdlc but really like we also

686
00:29:28,910 --> 00:29:33,110
talked about okay this the sock or sack

687
00:29:31,130 --> 00:29:35,030
ops team or just they have alert fatigue

688
00:29:33,110 --> 00:29:36,409
and are flooded we don't want to add on

689
00:29:35,030 --> 00:29:38,899
to that we want to give them a

690
00:29:36,410 --> 00:30:00,230
comprehensive dashboard or graphs of

691
00:29:38,900 --> 00:30:01,850
actionable metrics like I'm in the

692
00:30:00,230 --> 00:30:03,470
opinion like it shouldn't be bespoke

693
00:30:01,850 --> 00:30:06,080
like I don't think anybody is that

694
00:30:03,470 --> 00:30:09,260
special their application is composed of

695
00:30:06,080 --> 00:30:11,449
very similar open source components like

696
00:30:09,260 --> 00:30:12,950
like even you know a unique company like

697
00:30:11,450 --> 00:30:14,720
Netflix they use I mean they publish

698
00:30:12,950 --> 00:30:16,430
what they use like I don't think any

699
00:30:14,720 --> 00:30:19,070
environment is that special that they

700
00:30:16,430 --> 00:30:21,320
need you know a different methodology or

701
00:30:19,070 --> 00:30:23,389
overall pipeline and I think going back

702
00:30:21,320 --> 00:30:25,010
to I said about a/b testing you figure

703
00:30:23,390 --> 00:30:28,550
out which open source or commercial

704
00:30:25,010 --> 00:30:30,230
tools work the best for you but like we

705
00:30:28,550 --> 00:30:32,000
I mean we all there's well known

706
00:30:30,230 --> 00:30:33,980
architectures just well known tools as

707
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:35,540
well no frameworks everybody kind of

708
00:30:33,980 --> 00:30:37,790
packages them differently but that

709
00:30:35,540 --> 00:30:39,820
doesn't require different testing like

710
00:30:37,790 --> 00:30:42,230
the testing methodology can be the same

711
00:30:39,820 --> 00:30:44,540
so I just love to call in somebody when

712
00:30:42,230 --> 00:30:46,280
they don't answer the question but I'll

713
00:30:44,540 --> 00:30:49,520
just ask a general question in closing

714
00:30:46,280 --> 00:30:51,139
like like deafs I mean everybody's here

715
00:30:49,520 --> 00:30:53,570
because it's def con so we all and

716
00:30:51,140 --> 00:30:55,520
presumably everybody believes that this

717
00:30:53,570 --> 00:30:57,950
this notion of deaf SEC ops culture is

718
00:30:55,520 --> 00:31:00,620
important do you feel in your respective

719
00:30:57,950 --> 00:31:02,960
companies like that that's becoming more

720
00:31:00,620 --> 00:31:07,189
prevalent or people still it's early

721
00:31:02,960 --> 00:31:08,690
days for the notion of DEP SEC ops like

722
00:31:07,190 --> 00:31:10,520
it feels like to me it feels like it's

723
00:31:08,690 --> 00:31:12,740
gaining momentum and it's being talked

724
00:31:10,520 --> 00:31:14,600
about more but there's still a lot of

725
00:31:12,740 --> 00:31:16,040
work and thanks to francois on his team

726
00:31:14,600 --> 00:31:18,760
like I think conferences like this

727
00:31:16,040 --> 00:31:18,760
really build a where

728
00:31:20,090 --> 00:31:27,418
the culture shifting cultivation may not

729
00:31:24,840 --> 00:31:31,668
be checked against path so I think the

730
00:31:27,419 --> 00:31:31,669
developer to really understand

731
00:31:31,970 --> 00:31:45,330
organization no I mean this it always

732
00:31:43,890 --> 00:31:48,210
has to come on the top down whether it's

733
00:31:45,330 --> 00:31:49,740
CIO ctoc so like they really have to

734
00:31:48,210 --> 00:31:51,750
drive that culture change and talk about

735
00:31:49,740 --> 00:31:55,159
why and I feel like there's the

736
00:31:51,750 --> 00:31:55,159
challenge we have in general

737
00:31:55,630 --> 00:31:58,769
[Music]

738
00:31:58,929 --> 00:32:01,889
kochenko's

739
00:32:09,970 --> 00:32:29,660
you put the carrot before the stick I

740
00:32:26,530 --> 00:32:31,070
think that's a good point I think you

741
00:32:29,660 --> 00:32:33,020
know one thing I've noticed and trying

742
00:32:31,070 --> 00:32:34,639
to do like I've got we've gotten the

743
00:32:33,020 --> 00:32:35,120
response of like okay we're not ready

744
00:32:34,640 --> 00:32:37,640
yet

745
00:32:35,120 --> 00:32:38,989
which like if I'm selling or not it

746
00:32:37,640 --> 00:32:40,490
doesn't really make sense to me like

747
00:32:38,990 --> 00:32:42,410
okay you're not ready for security like

748
00:32:40,490 --> 00:32:44,210
okay what what are you gonna be ready

749
00:32:42,410 --> 00:32:46,730
for security when's it gonna become

750
00:32:44,210 --> 00:32:48,230
important after you have a breach and

751
00:32:46,730 --> 00:32:49,430
you're in the news and perhaps you've

752
00:32:48,230 --> 00:32:52,310
lost your job is that when it's

753
00:32:49,430 --> 00:32:54,200
important so I mean like I don't and I

754
00:32:52,310 --> 00:32:55,730
don't want to over index that with fear

755
00:32:54,200 --> 00:32:58,190
uncertainty and doubt and like scare

756
00:32:55,730 --> 00:33:00,260
people but it has to be part of the the

757
00:32:58,190 --> 00:33:02,060
new reality and I think the attack

758
00:33:00,260 --> 00:33:05,000
vectors now with IOT I mean it's

759
00:33:02,060 --> 00:33:06,590
increasing at a high velocity so we we

760
00:33:05,000 --> 00:33:09,320
have to change what we're doing and

761
00:33:06,590 --> 00:33:11,149
going back to my regulatory rant like we

762
00:33:09,320 --> 00:33:13,629
need some like you l equivalent around

763
00:33:11,150 --> 00:33:13,630
IOT

764
00:33:14,060 --> 00:33:21,230
[Music]

765
00:33:16,380 --> 00:33:27,380
from my experience in counting testicles

766
00:33:21,230 --> 00:33:27,380
we deal from the numbers this morning

767
00:33:41,980 --> 00:33:45,980
I've actually thought about that a lot

768
00:33:44,120 --> 00:33:47,899
lately like talking to some firms that

769
00:33:45,980 --> 00:33:50,780
are still in waterfall or Wadge 'el I

770
00:33:47,900 --> 00:33:54,170
actually think you it's probably easier

771
00:33:50,780 --> 00:33:57,139
to bring dev SEC ops culture in before

772
00:33:54,170 --> 00:33:58,730
there's a DevOps culture just I think

773
00:33:57,140 --> 00:34:00,890
there's some contention that happens

774
00:33:58,730 --> 00:34:03,080
like oK we've already done this like why

775
00:34:00,890 --> 00:34:05,240
did we need security whereas you if you

776
00:34:03,080 --> 00:34:07,280
bring it in as one full package it might

777
00:34:05,240 --> 00:34:10,550
be easier depending once again on the

778
00:34:07,280 --> 00:34:13,759
leadership but I don't think you need to

779
00:34:10,550 --> 00:34:17,300
have adopted devs DevOps methodology or

780
00:34:13,760 --> 00:34:19,490
a full agile framework to do this like

781
00:34:17,300 --> 00:34:22,280
let's start doing security testing early

782
00:34:19,489 --> 00:34:24,709
on irrespective of the methodology and

783
00:34:22,280 --> 00:34:27,610
culture like let's start ingraining it

784
00:34:24,710 --> 00:34:27,610
quickly or early

785
00:34:30,899 --> 00:34:47,699
I think they should be done at the same

786
00:34:46,168 --> 00:34:49,558
time like if you if you think about

787
00:34:47,699 --> 00:34:52,109
security assurance and QA assurance like

788
00:34:49,559 --> 00:34:53,909
the way you test is the same you're

789
00:34:52,109 --> 00:34:56,460
using different tools but the framework

790
00:34:53,909 --> 00:34:58,140
is the same so like have that

791
00:34:56,460 --> 00:35:00,599
collaborate and measure both of those

792
00:34:58,140 --> 00:35:04,400
but do it at the same time I think you

793
00:35:00,599 --> 00:35:04,400
can paralyze this it doesn't have to be

794
00:35:16,400 --> 00:35:20,690
good we can do that

[Music]

797
00:35:54,859 --> 00:36:00,630
absolutely and I think no offense to any

798
00:35:57,170 --> 00:36:01,950
ethical hacker or pentester but like you

799
00:36:00,630 --> 00:36:03,869
can actually through automation

800
00:36:01,950 --> 00:36:05,759
orchestration you can actually become

801
00:36:03,869 --> 00:36:08,670
much more efficient so now you can

802
00:36:05,760 --> 00:36:10,800
paralyze your your scripts or however

803
00:36:08,670 --> 00:36:13,380
you do the pen testing and aggregate

804
00:36:10,800 --> 00:36:15,510
those results and then that gives you

805
00:36:13,380 --> 00:36:18,059
more time to focus on higher order

806
00:36:15,510 --> 00:36:20,790
things like increasing the resiliency of

807
00:36:18,059 --> 00:36:22,950
your custom consumer or customer facing

808
00:36:20,790 --> 00:36:25,319
application like that's the goal it's

809
00:36:22,950 --> 00:36:27,779
not look what I do is special and no one

810
00:36:25,319 --> 00:36:30,240
else can do this like making them more

811
00:36:27,780 --> 00:36:34,190
efficient is is the message I would give

812
00:36:30,240 --> 00:36:34,189
and I do give that

813
00:36:35,450 --> 00:36:38,509

[Music]

815
00:37:01,539 --> 00:37:08,660
I mean literally during my whole career

816
00:37:06,680 --> 00:37:10,578
every job I've ever had that role was

817
00:37:08,660 --> 00:37:12,200
going away like I started off as a UNIX

818
00:37:10,579 --> 00:37:15,020
system man back in the bare-metal

819
00:37:12,200 --> 00:37:17,328
big sun sparc server days and UNIX

820
00:37:15,020 --> 00:37:18,859
system ins were always going away no you

821
00:37:17,329 --> 00:37:20,720
just had to continually evolve and take

822
00:37:18,859 --> 00:37:23,720
some programmatic skills as his

823
00:37:20,720 --> 00:37:25,578
infrastructure scaled out and now as he

824
00:37:23,720 --> 00:37:27,140
moved to cloud use how to become a you

825
00:37:25,579 --> 00:37:29,329
had to know how to program cloud

826
00:37:27,140 --> 00:37:32,480
infrastructure and manage servers and

827
00:37:29,329 --> 00:37:34,819
instances you can't touch and you go on

828
00:37:32,480 --> 00:37:36,289
like the CIO of CIO the role is going

829
00:37:34,819 --> 00:37:37,819
away no you have to continually evolve

830
00:37:36,289 --> 00:37:40,250
and become both technical and

831
00:37:37,819 --> 00:37:41,750
businesslike so thank you you like if

832
00:37:40,250 --> 00:37:44,539
you stay stagnant in your role

833
00:37:41,750 --> 00:37:46,190
irrespective of what you're doing your

834
00:37:44,539 --> 00:37:47,869
job will go away because you will get

835
00:37:46,190 --> 00:37:50,150
left behind the world's moving faster

836
00:37:47,869 --> 00:37:52,220
and faster and you have to keep keep

837
00:37:50,150 --> 00:37:54,500
pace with that change and I think that's

838
00:37:52,220 --> 00:37:56,089
really what dev sack ops is about like

839
00:37:54,500 --> 00:37:58,309
let's not leave security you know

840
00:37:56,089 --> 00:38:00,740
falling further and further behind let's

841
00:37:58,309 --> 00:38:02,210
allow it to catch up and keep pace well

842
00:38:00,740 --> 00:38:03,790
thanks everyone I don't think anybody

843
00:38:02,210 --> 00:38:10,900
fell asleep so traditionally

844
00:38:03,790 --> 00:38:10,900
