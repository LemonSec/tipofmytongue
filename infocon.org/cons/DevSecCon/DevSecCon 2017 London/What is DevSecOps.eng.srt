1
00:00:04,490 --> 00:00:08,660
devstack ups what is it has a hard

2
00:00:06,470 --> 00:00:11,719
question to answer it's about shifting

3
00:00:08,660 --> 00:00:13,370
security left as far as possible and but

4
00:00:11,719 --> 00:00:15,980
more importantly that making it

5
00:00:13,370 --> 00:00:17,960
everyone's problem to solve and

6
00:00:15,980 --> 00:00:20,029
everyone's something to be part of

7
00:00:17,960 --> 00:00:22,099
everyone's behavior the idea of where

8
00:00:20,029 --> 00:00:24,230
people are now by embracing that more of

9
00:00:22,099 --> 00:00:26,750
a DevOps or deficit cops model is

10
00:00:24,230 --> 00:00:28,880
they're creating more participation from

11
00:00:26,750 --> 00:00:31,759
security teams with the people actually

12
00:00:28,880 --> 00:00:33,440
write code and have to deploy code and I

13
00:00:31,759 --> 00:00:34,940
think that's the if they take the idea

14
00:00:33,440 --> 00:00:37,218
of you know walk a mile in someone

15
00:00:34,940 --> 00:00:39,320
else's shoes security teams are now

16
00:00:37,219 --> 00:00:41,000
being part of that journey and they're

17
00:00:39,320 --> 00:00:43,429
also being part of that conversation too

18
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:47,059
many deaf sack ops is an important

19
00:00:43,429 --> 00:00:49,730
movement because it's about delivering

20
00:00:47,059 --> 00:00:53,539
business value it's about getting things

21
00:00:49,730 --> 00:00:55,879
done it's about D silos ation rather

22
00:00:53,539 --> 00:00:58,699
than a security team sitting from on

23
00:00:55,879 --> 00:01:00,710
high mandating thou shalt to do this or

24
00:00:58,699 --> 00:01:02,449
not do this and it's much more of an

25
00:01:00,710 --> 00:01:05,570
enabler now or it's at least trying to

26
00:01:02,449 --> 00:01:08,030
say the question or or change the answer

27
00:01:05,570 --> 00:01:10,130
from no don't do that to that sounds

28
00:01:08,030 --> 00:01:12,049
hard but here's maybe how we can try to

29
00:01:10,130 --> 00:01:13,789
do that in a secure way someone I was

30
00:01:12,049 --> 00:01:17,329
just talking to use the term the

31
00:01:13,790 --> 00:01:20,360
security ivory tower where people make

32
00:01:17,329 --> 00:01:26,059
proclamations and say we're gonna do

33
00:01:20,360 --> 00:01:28,219
this and if it's not accepted they say

34
00:01:26,060 --> 00:01:31,009
why aren't you listening to me when we

35
00:01:28,219 --> 00:01:33,500
get towards deaf sac ops we move from

36
00:01:31,009 --> 00:01:37,670
wired you listen to me to how can we

37
00:01:33,500 --> 00:01:40,759
work together how can we take the

38
00:01:37,670 --> 00:01:43,460
development activity the operational

39
00:01:40,759 --> 00:01:45,979
activity in integrate security so that

40
00:01:43,460 --> 00:01:48,020
we actually build security in dev

41
00:01:45,979 --> 00:01:49,369
suck-ups is it's difficult to quantify

42
00:01:48,020 --> 00:01:51,649
and it's difficult to know when you've

43
00:01:49,369 --> 00:01:53,210
got it right I think measure of success

44
00:01:51,649 --> 00:01:55,009
is when everyone's thinking about

45
00:01:53,210 --> 00:01:57,350
security and when you could pick any

46
00:01:55,009 --> 00:01:58,880
part of your build pipeline and be able

47
00:01:57,350 --> 00:02:01,070
to demonstrate that security is there

48
00:01:58,880 --> 00:02:02,658
there's always that pressure for

49
00:02:01,070 --> 00:02:04,070
developers and for the developing work

50
00:02:02,659 --> 00:02:05,659
to actually develop things quickly

51
00:02:04,070 --> 00:02:07,250
because at the end of the day we're

52
00:02:05,659 --> 00:02:10,100
running business and everybody's running

53
00:02:07,250 --> 00:02:12,470
a business and everybody has cut off

54
00:02:10,100 --> 00:02:15,109
date in order to get things done and the

55
00:02:12,470 --> 00:02:16,940
security is often overlooked

56
00:02:15,110 --> 00:02:19,640
we need to do things quickly so I think

57
00:02:16,940 --> 00:02:21,770
dev sir cops is about saying hey we need

58
00:02:19,640 --> 00:02:23,209
to build products we met to make sure

59
00:02:21,770 --> 00:02:25,430
that it's fast and quick and agile

60
00:02:23,210 --> 00:02:27,380
we've also to do it really securely so

61
00:02:25,430 --> 00:02:29,300
that at least when we're shipping code

62
00:02:27,380 --> 00:02:31,280
like it's secure people aren't gonna get

63
00:02:29,300 --> 00:02:33,260
owned Ephron Center I think this is

64
00:02:31,280 --> 00:02:35,330
where the Internet of Things is going

65
00:02:33,260 --> 00:02:36,829
and this is where the dev Wells going

66
00:02:35,330 --> 00:02:38,240
this is what everything is going saying

67
00:02:36,830 --> 00:02:40,430
they're secure it is part of everything

68
00:02:38,240 --> 00:02:44,560
we need to stop saying security for

69
00:02:40,430 --> 00:02:44,560
security people Security's for everyone
