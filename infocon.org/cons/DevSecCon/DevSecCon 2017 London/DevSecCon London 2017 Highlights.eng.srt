1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:09,000
I came to DEFCON four I guess well two

2
00:00:06,660 --> 00:00:10,620
reasons one the ulterior motive I always

3
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:13,290
loved London so it's a great place to be

4
00:00:10,620 --> 00:00:16,320
but also for that I love the idea of the

5
00:00:13,290 --> 00:00:18,359
devstack ops and wanted to come here to

6
00:00:16,320 --> 00:00:20,820
hear about people that are actually

7
00:00:18,359 --> 00:00:23,279
practitioners it's very much a building

8
00:00:20,820 --> 00:00:25,529
conference so people here want to fix

9
00:00:23,279 --> 00:00:27,990
problems they're all about building new

10
00:00:25,529 --> 00:00:29,609
stuff writing new code how do I make

11
00:00:27,990 --> 00:00:31,650
this secure and I think you can see that

12
00:00:29,609 --> 00:00:34,110
by just listening and watching people's

13
00:00:31,650 --> 00:00:35,670
interactions in the lobbies in the

14
00:00:34,110 --> 00:00:37,620
hallways at other talks and I think

15
00:00:35,670 --> 00:00:39,360
that's quite an exciting thing I think

16
00:00:37,620 --> 00:00:40,860
if we look at where we've come from an

17
00:00:39,360 --> 00:00:43,739
industry of people trying to hack a

18
00:00:40,860 --> 00:00:45,660
break stuff we're now in the design

19
00:00:43,739 --> 00:00:47,968
phase of the next generation of the web

20
00:00:45,660 --> 00:00:50,099
web 3 - oh and I think it's about time

21
00:00:47,969 --> 00:00:52,320
we all stopped with the egos saying

22
00:00:50,100 --> 00:00:53,820
security works over there and developers

23
00:00:52,320 --> 00:00:56,930
work over there I think we all need to

24
00:00:53,820 --> 00:00:56,930
stop working together

25
00:01:00,030 --> 00:01:04,690
their second is is different to a lot of

26
00:01:02,649 --> 00:01:06,520
conferences I've been to I think one of

27
00:01:04,690 --> 00:01:08,500
the main reasons it's not heavily

28
00:01:06,520 --> 00:01:10,210
vandalized which means that the

29
00:01:08,500 --> 00:01:12,159
information I'm getting the things I'm

30
00:01:10,210 --> 00:01:14,500
learning if things that are relevant to

31
00:01:12,159 --> 00:01:15,250
me in the business and a requirement

32
00:01:14,500 --> 00:01:17,170
lead

33
00:01:15,250 --> 00:01:18,729
rather than product met the threat

34
00:01:17,170 --> 00:01:21,790
modeling workshop led by Steven

35
00:01:18,729 --> 00:01:25,720
yesterday and the first day was really

36
00:01:21,790 --> 00:01:27,580
good we like to scrum and Kanban and how

37
00:01:25,720 --> 00:01:29,590
to integrate very mulling into the

38
00:01:27,580 --> 00:01:32,500
different stages but I've really been

39
00:01:29,590 --> 00:01:35,710
having a good time engaging with people

40
00:01:32,500 --> 00:01:40,119
here it's a great mix of different

41
00:01:35,710 --> 00:01:42,038
communities obviously dev Zack ops in a

42
00:01:40,119 --> 00:01:45,789
way that I don't see very often curing

43
00:01:42,039 --> 00:01:48,850
people say on stage I'm exploring this

44
00:01:45,789 --> 00:01:50,229
I'm experimenting with that not sure how

45
00:01:48,850 --> 00:01:52,630
it's all going to come together

46
00:01:50,229 --> 00:01:55,149
but collaborating and finding new ways

47
00:01:52,630 --> 00:01:58,869
to do things very exciting to me to be a

48
00:01:55,149 --> 00:02:01,600
part of is not overpowered by vendors

49
00:01:58,869 --> 00:02:04,330
and politics is really a community where

50
00:02:01,600 --> 00:02:06,788
you have real workshops you have talks

51
00:02:04,330 --> 00:02:10,030
and you get to meet people if you want

52
00:02:06,789 --> 00:02:14,709
to it's just fun and it's bobbing with

53
00:02:10,030 --> 00:02:18,010
ideas so it's a good place to be I think

54
00:02:14,709 --> 00:02:20,140
my favorite talk was done by Xavier and

55
00:02:18,010 --> 00:02:22,750
that was moving kind of security to left

56
00:02:20,140 --> 00:02:24,940
but then going beyond and I think his

57
00:02:22,750 --> 00:02:26,530
view was very much around producing a

58
00:02:24,940 --> 00:02:30,400
security wrap for the whole of the

59
00:02:26,530 --> 00:02:32,650
lifecycle model agile and episode ops

60
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:34,150
that was a yeah really interesting talk

61
00:02:32,650 --> 00:02:37,629
I think it's quite relates to what I do

62
00:02:34,150 --> 00:02:38,970
on a day to day basis I hope that more

63
00:02:37,629 --> 00:02:41,640
women will

64
00:02:38,970 --> 00:02:44,880
be inspired by my talk to not only

65
00:02:41,640 --> 00:02:48,660
become speakers but also to join the

66
00:02:44,880 --> 00:02:51,600
security and operations field too

67
00:02:48,660 --> 00:02:54,540
because here there are not only guys in

68
00:02:51,600 --> 00:02:56,960
hoodies I plan to come back next year

69
00:02:54,540 --> 00:03:02,600
and also to convince my colleagues to

70
00:02:56,960 --> 00:03:02,600
not only attend but also to submit talks

71
00:03:02,620 --> 00:03:05,770
