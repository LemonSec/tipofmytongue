1
00:00:00,890 --> 00:00:12,690
what is something that these identity

2
00:00:09,030 --> 00:00:15,149
topics because I found myself kind of

3
00:00:12,690 --> 00:00:17,730
recently I'll probably say maybe five or

4
00:00:15,150 --> 00:00:19,619
seven years does I realized that our

5
00:00:17,730 --> 00:00:23,070
speaking graphs for a long time it's

6
00:00:19,619 --> 00:00:25,080
just to never kill Eclipse so I'm going

7
00:00:23,070 --> 00:00:33,989
to show you how a lot of the things that

8
00:00:25,080 --> 00:00:37,739
we do automated organization approaching

9
00:00:33,989 --> 00:00:41,790
Allison wrap so this wraps HP presley's

10
00:00:37,739 --> 00:00:44,129
line but right so why watching of crafts

11
00:00:41,790 --> 00:00:46,620
and HTV part of the properties perhaps

12
00:00:44,129 --> 00:00:48,718
are a much better framework to look at

13
00:00:46,620 --> 00:00:51,180
the problem and one of things I liked

14
00:00:48,719 --> 00:00:53,789
about design these designs of balance a

15
00:00:51,180 --> 00:00:56,160
way where you refactor the problem until

16
00:00:53,789 --> 00:00:58,050
the solution becomes easy and so in a

17
00:00:56,160 --> 00:00:59,849
way you work the problem you keep

18
00:00:58,050 --> 00:01:01,890
working enough work in a torqueman until

19
00:00:59,850 --> 00:01:03,809
the solutions are easier solutions are

20
00:01:01,890 --> 00:01:05,850
not easy a lot of times because you

21
00:01:03,809 --> 00:01:08,789
haven't redefined the problem correctly

22
00:01:05,850 --> 00:01:10,259
so and grabs the niche the example of

23
00:01:08,790 --> 00:01:12,630
that because along doing a much more

24
00:01:10,260 --> 00:01:16,049
interactive and I would say real world

25
00:01:12,630 --> 00:01:18,089
where where you actually begin almost

26
00:01:16,049 --> 00:01:19,860
eight the messiness and complexity over

27
00:01:18,090 --> 00:01:22,200
the world and events and activities to

28
00:01:19,860 --> 00:01:23,729
actually make you part of the solution

29
00:01:22,200 --> 00:01:26,040
so let's just look at a bunch of

30
00:01:23,729 --> 00:01:27,330
examples of lots of rock right so I

31
00:01:26,040 --> 00:01:30,210
don't need to grab your stuff

32
00:01:27,330 --> 00:01:33,390
okay that's my sometimes go to the bra

33
00:01:30,210 --> 00:01:39,059
for representation you gotta remind that

34
00:01:33,390 --> 00:01:40,110
graph graphs are more abstract data

35
00:01:39,060 --> 00:01:44,430
structures

36
00:01:40,110 --> 00:01:46,380
objects and so basically nodes and edges

37
00:01:44,430 --> 00:01:47,760
that's how I think we're friends

38
00:01:46,380 --> 00:01:50,789
he's about finished connecting things

39
00:01:47,760 --> 00:01:52,470
it's about literally something that's

40
00:01:50,790 --> 00:01:54,780
connected to something else with

41
00:01:52,470 --> 00:02:00,630
attributes that space you might really

42
00:01:54,780 --> 00:02:02,520
crack right so three which is also a way

43
00:02:00,630 --> 00:02:04,289
that graph scales because once you can

44
00:02:02,520 --> 00:02:09,258
get Danny to graph format there's

45
00:02:04,290 --> 00:02:13,680
actually a lot of great math mathematics

46
00:02:09,258 --> 00:02:16,500
that already exists behind it so that's

47
00:02:13,680 --> 00:02:18,810
actually a really popular back so we

48
00:02:16,500 --> 00:02:20,250
feel lookin in security we have plenty

49
00:02:18,810 --> 00:02:22,020
of examples how you have perhaps a

50
00:02:20,250 --> 00:02:24,630
security app and even things like the

51
00:02:22,020 --> 00:02:26,100
factories which are very cushy and you

52
00:02:24,630 --> 00:02:29,609
can even visualize stuff like that

53
00:02:26,100 --> 00:02:30,630
Thanks so I did see some people might

54
00:02:29,610 --> 00:02:32,190
look you might look better than you see

55
00:02:30,630 --> 00:02:33,570
a lot of complexity or you might look at

56
00:02:32,190 --> 00:02:36,000
a and see a lot of simplicity

57
00:02:33,570 --> 00:02:37,709
you might depends what question you ask

58
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:40,920
them but then how you actually process

59
00:02:37,709 --> 00:02:42,840
the data threat models for example our

60
00:02:40,920 --> 00:02:44,100
graph if you look at what we do when you

61
00:02:42,840 --> 00:02:45,209
do a threat modeling you got your

62
00:02:44,100 --> 00:02:47,220
creating the graph you're creating

63
00:02:45,209 --> 00:02:49,019
connections you basically mapping things

64
00:02:47,220 --> 00:02:51,330
out we've got it from A to B and

65
00:02:49,019 --> 00:02:53,940
understanding what we don't do is we

66
00:02:51,330 --> 00:02:56,100
don't analyze this programmatically

67
00:02:53,940 --> 00:02:58,140
although do we are some tools are trying

68
00:02:56,100 --> 00:03:00,750
to do so the technology tools are trying

69
00:02:58,140 --> 00:03:03,690
to do that well reality is we actually

70
00:03:00,750 --> 00:03:05,070
need static announced technology so for

71
00:03:03,690 --> 00:03:07,440
the everybody years I'm working on

72
00:03:05,070 --> 00:03:09,329
telekinetic knowledge e1 is still being

73
00:03:07,440 --> 00:03:12,180
missing tricks that we have is we need

74
00:03:09,330 --> 00:03:14,010
to start using that kind of kind of

75
00:03:12,180 --> 00:03:15,810
techniques and capabilities even for

76
00:03:14,010 --> 00:03:18,269
more real-world stuff that we have

77
00:03:15,810 --> 00:03:21,030
because these gets very complex and very

78
00:03:18,269 --> 00:03:23,160
quickly so the key thing is some of the

79
00:03:21,030 --> 00:03:25,080
biggest covers in the world are graphs I

80
00:03:23,160 --> 00:03:27,720
would even argue that to come to work

81
00:03:25,080 --> 00:03:29,340
for is a graph itself because it's all

82
00:03:27,720 --> 00:03:31,170
about making connections is all about

83
00:03:29,340 --> 00:03:33,780
mapping things out so first of all clear

84
00:03:31,170 --> 00:03:35,130
it is google it clear is a graph if you

85
00:03:33,780 --> 00:03:37,230
look at specially the things they do now

86
00:03:35,130 --> 00:03:39,060
with a Google graph and how prohibitive

87
00:03:37,230 --> 00:03:41,518
search for a movie you actually get much

88
00:03:39,060 --> 00:03:44,400
better connections and also things like

89
00:03:41,519 --> 00:03:46,530
LinkedIn they are clearly graphs right

90
00:03:44,400 --> 00:03:48,240
and it's and it's an interesting thing

91
00:03:46,530 --> 00:03:50,250
that you if you look at some of the

92
00:03:48,240 --> 00:03:52,920
technology cameras in the planet and you

93
00:03:50,250 --> 00:03:54,150
look at their databases and how they

94
00:03:52,920 --> 00:03:56,040
structure most of them are actually

95
00:03:54,150 --> 00:03:59,340
brows right so clearly there's a nice

96
00:03:56,040 --> 00:04:01,109
kind of connection there right so the

97
00:03:59,340 --> 00:04:04,140
other part is about actually is ideas

98
00:04:01,110 --> 00:04:06,390
themselves across right ideas are these

99
00:04:04,140 --> 00:04:08,429
project little things that you have to

100
00:04:06,390 --> 00:04:11,579
basically be connecting and evolve and

101
00:04:08,430 --> 00:04:13,500
I'm definite for example this is my

102
00:04:11,580 --> 00:04:16,080
ideas for this talk literally this is

103
00:04:13,500 --> 00:04:18,510
how I create a talk I just do the math

104
00:04:16,079 --> 00:04:20,430
exam connected things draw broad lines

105
00:04:18,510 --> 00:04:23,810
this was my thinking process that

106
00:04:20,430 --> 00:04:25,980
actually got me to this so it's very

107
00:04:23,810 --> 00:04:28,110
powerful when you start to view ideas

108
00:04:25,980 --> 00:04:31,020
are something that you need to collect

109
00:04:28,110 --> 00:04:33,630
and process and allow to grow and you

110
00:04:31,020 --> 00:04:36,450
can visualize it as a graph and as the

111
00:04:33,630 --> 00:04:38,010
system now if you go to zero and for

112
00:04:36,450 --> 00:04:40,260
example and workflow so I'm gonna talk a

113
00:04:38,010 --> 00:04:41,520
bit about JIRA and confluence just

114
00:04:40,260 --> 00:04:43,469
because it happens to be the platform

115
00:04:41,520 --> 00:04:46,169
that I happen to land that was quite a

116
00:04:43,470 --> 00:04:47,820
chore so I end up using it and it kind

117
00:04:46,170 --> 00:04:50,190
of do this with some others although

118
00:04:47,820 --> 00:04:51,719
it's a bit more difficult so not I'm

119
00:04:50,190 --> 00:04:54,590
representing juror but it just happens

120
00:04:51,720 --> 00:04:57,570
to me that the platform I implemented in

121
00:04:54,590 --> 00:05:00,060
my mind and also the present actuality

122
00:04:57,570 --> 00:05:01,710
to do all the stuff so these for example

123
00:05:00,060 --> 00:05:04,080
I have better presentational it's how we

124
00:05:01,710 --> 00:05:05,280
manage risk all right since your HD

125
00:05:04,080 --> 00:05:07,469
because you could see it's actually

126
00:05:05,280 --> 00:05:08,820
graph is connected and you'll see how

127
00:05:07,470 --> 00:05:10,530
this is almost like now in three

128
00:05:08,820 --> 00:05:12,780
dimensions once you add the other parts

129
00:05:10,530 --> 00:05:15,390
to it so you've got allocate a big cigar

130
00:05:12,780 --> 00:05:17,010
do the beautiful except with button

131
00:05:15,390 --> 00:05:18,539
right which is what makes the whole

132
00:05:17,010 --> 00:05:19,800
difference so if you're looking for a

133
00:05:18,540 --> 00:05:21,900
way to solve your risk management

134
00:05:19,800 --> 00:05:23,570
problem you need a button that says

135
00:05:21,900 --> 00:05:26,340
except for it right once you do that

136
00:05:23,570 --> 00:05:28,170
right then things work until you have

137
00:05:26,340 --> 00:05:30,359
that button you are always fighting

138
00:05:28,170 --> 00:05:32,910
appeal and you get ignored or you get a

139
00:05:30,360 --> 00:05:34,980
lot of decisions made right but never

140
00:05:32,910 --> 00:05:36,900
kind of acknowledged or in the kind of

141
00:05:34,980 --> 00:05:38,820
ether right and emails and

142
00:05:36,900 --> 00:05:41,789
communications and meetings are not

143
00:05:38,820 --> 00:05:45,330
enough decision devices right and button

144
00:05:41,790 --> 00:05:48,270
to say I accept this risk is a decision

145
00:05:45,330 --> 00:05:50,820
device and then of course the security

146
00:05:48,270 --> 00:05:52,799
all the way to receive so has to accept

147
00:05:50,820 --> 00:05:54,990
and approve that website there is it's

148
00:05:52,800 --> 00:05:55,590
everything gets approved by both in

149
00:05:54,990 --> 00:05:57,030
setting

150
00:05:55,590 --> 00:05:59,849
tasks within the same thing from both

151
00:05:57,030 --> 00:06:01,200
items basically we go crazy and like we

152
00:05:59,850 --> 00:06:02,880
get you're creating work clothes after

153
00:06:01,200 --> 00:06:05,159
work without after work clothes now we

154
00:06:02,880 --> 00:06:07,530
keep redefining them because we now hear

155
00:06:05,160 --> 00:06:09,000
that everything we do becomes a kind of

156
00:06:07,530 --> 00:06:12,469
a graph becomes a workflow and you

157
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:15,900
connect the dots right hey of course

158
00:06:12,470 --> 00:06:18,000
source code is a grout can anybody happy

159
00:06:15,900 --> 00:06:19,500
to find what what I'm running here which

160
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:27,570
tool I'm running he doesn't giving me

161
00:06:19,500 --> 00:06:30,530
their the green does really who programs

162
00:06:27,570 --> 00:06:33,659
it who actually works in programmers

163
00:06:30,530 --> 00:06:37,138
alright who programs in JavaScript it

164
00:06:33,660 --> 00:06:39,750
may be okay so Nick so this is the tool

165
00:06:37,139 --> 00:06:42,690
right it's amazing right and I've got

166
00:06:39,750 --> 00:06:44,880
this spectacular how even sometimes

167
00:06:42,690 --> 00:06:46,290
great ideas and and really like

168
00:06:44,880 --> 00:06:49,020
something there you go and this is it

169
00:06:46,290 --> 00:06:50,760
right these guys have nail that yes you

170
00:06:49,020 --> 00:06:52,049
sucks it costs 200 bucks or whatever

171
00:06:50,760 --> 00:06:54,030
right because the freaking ID is

172
00:06:52,050 --> 00:06:56,880
honorific intelligent you know it's not

173
00:06:54,030 --> 00:06:57,929
free again but this is basically in

174
00:06:56,880 --> 00:06:59,820
essence language right

175
00:06:57,930 --> 00:07:01,320
this is vulnerable Jas right it's the

176
00:06:59,820 --> 00:07:04,080
only tool that will actually say that

177
00:07:01,320 --> 00:07:05,820
you have to use because is the only tool

178
00:07:04,080 --> 00:07:09,000
that gives you the correct environment

179
00:07:05,820 --> 00:07:10,710
to write tests what you're not here is I

180
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:13,470
have real-time code coverage and

181
00:07:10,710 --> 00:07:16,260
real-time test execution literally I

182
00:07:13,470 --> 00:07:19,200
come in here I change one of these

183
00:07:16,260 --> 00:07:20,940
properties in milliseconds my test will

184
00:07:19,200 --> 00:07:23,430
have run I would have struck me the

185
00:07:20,940 --> 00:07:26,160
results if you want to do test-driven

186
00:07:23,430 --> 00:07:27,570
development or any query any development

187
00:07:26,160 --> 00:07:29,760
meaning in the environment where

188
00:07:27,570 --> 00:07:31,349
literally you make something or you make

189
00:07:29,760 --> 00:07:33,750
a change you lift your hands and the

190
00:07:31,350 --> 00:07:35,340
test runs I musical some very powerful

191
00:07:33,750 --> 00:07:37,380
because he owes to me they can go I can

192
00:07:35,340 --> 00:07:39,810
go to the middle of the code I can make

193
00:07:37,380 --> 00:07:42,539
a change and you will run all the tests

194
00:07:39,810 --> 00:07:45,360
that are affected by that one change so

195
00:07:42,539 --> 00:07:48,330
this is it's crazily effective and I

196
00:07:45,360 --> 00:07:50,160
still killed me the fact that every idea

197
00:07:48,330 --> 00:07:52,320
has not jumped into the bandwagon

198
00:07:50,160 --> 00:07:53,490
right because you know you see a lot of

199
00:07:52,320 --> 00:07:55,050
talk a bit later are we talk about

200
00:07:53,490 --> 00:07:57,060
testing things like the cloud and other

201
00:07:55,050 --> 00:07:58,740
platforms like we are making the same

202
00:07:57,060 --> 00:08:00,510
mistakes again right we have we haven't

203
00:07:58,740 --> 00:08:01,780
even always got to the point where we

204
00:08:00,510 --> 00:08:03,190
get the great develop environment

205
00:08:01,780 --> 00:08:04,900
we're making the same problem a bit

206
00:08:03,190 --> 00:08:06,130
further on but you need to get this

207
00:08:04,900 --> 00:08:08,049
right you need to get me Bonnie where

208
00:08:06,130 --> 00:08:09,460
every every time you make something you

209
00:08:08,050 --> 00:08:11,350
need to get immediate feedback and

210
00:08:09,460 --> 00:08:13,510
immediate feedback is not on the screen

211
00:08:11,350 --> 00:08:15,370
right that's not immediate feedback that

212
00:08:13,510 --> 00:08:17,889
is using your eyeballs right and your

213
00:08:15,370 --> 00:08:19,810
brains as a text you need a repeatable

214
00:08:17,889 --> 00:08:21,970
way to verify what your stuff without

215
00:08:19,810 --> 00:08:23,620
that you you would never scare and

216
00:08:21,970 --> 00:08:25,330
security is important because this is

217
00:08:23,620 --> 00:08:27,370
how it should be texting security check

218
00:08:25,330 --> 00:08:28,780
out first onto the graph - again you can

219
00:08:27,370 --> 00:08:30,610
do this you can get even more

220
00:08:28,780 --> 00:08:32,289
interesting tasks you can sector I have

221
00:08:30,610 --> 00:08:35,229
things where you go into the AFC you

222
00:08:32,289 --> 00:08:37,330
master across right again I remember I

223
00:08:35,229 --> 00:08:39,070
was working for an slobs

224
00:08:37,330 --> 00:08:40,930
if anybody remember what that company

225
00:08:39,070 --> 00:08:41,890
was right they were bought by IBM you

226
00:08:40,929 --> 00:08:43,598
cannot stand

227
00:08:41,890 --> 00:08:45,730
I remember training a graph like this I

228
00:08:43,599 --> 00:08:47,650
was creating we don't do platform and I

229
00:08:45,730 --> 00:08:50,080
remember some guy saying that super

230
00:08:47,650 --> 00:08:51,910
complex right there was another dude who

231
00:08:50,080 --> 00:08:53,770
was actually doing these manually since

232
00:08:51,910 --> 00:08:54,790
that is the most simple thing I've seen

233
00:08:53,770 --> 00:08:56,530
right

234
00:08:54,790 --> 00:08:58,390
because exactly represented in fact

235
00:08:56,530 --> 00:09:01,000
surface for example you know he would

236
00:08:58,390 --> 00:09:03,490
spend literally a day or two to generate

237
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:05,530
you know a tenth of that the quality of

238
00:09:03,490 --> 00:09:07,000
that market right so it's very easy when

239
00:09:05,530 --> 00:09:09,069
you could start to program things so I

240
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:12,160
look these days at anything as an API

241
00:09:09,070 --> 00:09:14,080
right and and if there isn't API I'm you

242
00:09:12,160 --> 00:09:15,430
know I'm like one refactoring away from

243
00:09:14,080 --> 00:09:16,660
creating API on top of that thing

244
00:09:15,430 --> 00:09:17,859
because once again it yeah you can

245
00:09:16,660 --> 00:09:20,890
program right and then you build a graph

246
00:09:17,860 --> 00:09:22,810
then you're running right so give itself

247
00:09:20,890 --> 00:09:24,670
it's a graph right again I don't know

248
00:09:22,810 --> 00:09:26,140
how deep you guys going to get but it's

249
00:09:24,670 --> 00:09:28,900
very interesting you should try to get

250
00:09:26,140 --> 00:09:31,089
in there because the actual the way it

251
00:09:28,900 --> 00:09:33,160
works itself is a ground the really the

252
00:09:31,089 --> 00:09:34,960
reason I get scales is because the

253
00:09:33,160 --> 00:09:37,150
virtual file system that gets great this

254
00:09:34,960 --> 00:09:38,260
actual graph itself messing will make

255
00:09:37,150 --> 00:09:40,750
you understand better than getting and

256
00:09:38,260 --> 00:09:42,430
trying to get nothing to work right but

257
00:09:40,750 --> 00:09:43,780
it's really cool right I need mean if

258
00:09:42,430 --> 00:09:45,370
you look at darker the same thing I

259
00:09:43,780 --> 00:09:46,660
should have on that slide doctor itself

260
00:09:45,370 --> 00:09:47,589
is a graph the virtual file system

261
00:09:46,660 --> 00:09:49,930
docker

262
00:09:47,589 --> 00:09:52,330
he's also hyper connected right I like

263
00:09:49,930 --> 00:09:52,620
this I this is something I really want

264
00:09:52,330 --> 00:09:54,660
to

265
00:09:52,620 --> 00:09:56,670
you guys play with this thing I think is

266
00:09:54,660 --> 00:09:58,740
really freaking cool is this is where

267
00:09:56,670 --> 00:10:01,650
you start to apply machine learning to

268
00:09:58,740 --> 00:10:02,880
some of these draft things so and again

269
00:10:01,650 --> 00:10:03,810
you know for security there's a lot of

270
00:10:02,880 --> 00:10:06,450
interesting parts of it

271
00:10:03,810 --> 00:10:09,030
so finally right hypertensive brats like

272
00:10:06,450 --> 00:10:10,290
the way I describe but one thing that

273
00:10:09,030 --> 00:10:13,140
still doesn't happen enough either

274
00:10:10,290 --> 00:10:14,640
except we don't hyperlink enough so one

275
00:10:13,140 --> 00:10:16,170
of these I keep toys tell my team's I'm

276
00:10:14,640 --> 00:10:17,730
happening right can that make

277
00:10:16,170 --> 00:10:19,319
connections if you might go to a point

278
00:10:17,730 --> 00:10:21,690
me I should go to jump to the next one

279
00:10:19,320 --> 00:10:22,950
because every time we don't hyperlink

280
00:10:21,690 --> 00:10:25,050
something he means that you just break a

281
00:10:22,950 --> 00:10:27,440
chain it means is give less sufficient

282
00:10:25,050 --> 00:10:29,969
to actually do something like that right

283
00:10:27,440 --> 00:10:31,770
yeah so which think up there's no call

284
00:10:29,970 --> 00:10:33,510
me off for J you have an open source for

285
00:10:31,770 --> 00:10:34,829
anything but these guys are going to be

286
00:10:33,510 --> 00:10:37,650
doing a lot of great stuff in graphs

287
00:10:34,830 --> 00:10:40,110
it's fun I swear I have a really nice

288
00:10:37,650 --> 00:10:43,199
query language and the reason why this

289
00:10:40,110 --> 00:10:45,720
very language matters right is because

290
00:10:43,200 --> 00:10:47,340
we also you know if you look at what

291
00:10:45,720 --> 00:10:49,530
some of these you write you can say

292
00:10:47,340 --> 00:10:52,980
digit rate drops well it doesn't really

293
00:10:49,530 --> 00:10:55,050
write B so creates great snapshots of a

294
00:10:52,980 --> 00:10:56,850
graph and one of the problems you also

295
00:10:55,050 --> 00:10:57,959
have is you have to be able to dig your

296
00:10:56,850 --> 00:11:00,000
graph you have to be able to version

297
00:10:57,960 --> 00:11:02,640
control it you have to be able to see it

298
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:04,440
in time so one of the very important

299
00:11:02,640 --> 00:11:07,439
properties of the graph is that you also

300
00:11:04,440 --> 00:11:09,540
need to be able to capture it in a sort

301
00:11:07,440 --> 00:11:12,000
of language formats and that's why I

302
00:11:09,540 --> 00:11:13,860
like things like dot language like plant

303
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:15,120
or ml and some of the others because

304
00:11:13,860 --> 00:11:16,650
when you want to think about scaling

305
00:11:15,120 --> 00:11:18,960
your graph world

306
00:11:16,650 --> 00:11:21,870
if you cannot code it or you cannot

307
00:11:18,960 --> 00:11:24,510
represent it in a kind of a language

308
00:11:21,870 --> 00:11:27,090
like formats then again all you have the

309
00:11:24,510 --> 00:11:29,310
snapshots it's a bit like you is living

310
00:11:27,090 --> 00:11:30,510
between playing with an image versus

311
00:11:29,310 --> 00:11:32,939
being in Illustrator and playing with

312
00:11:30,510 --> 00:11:34,319
vector graphics right so it makes the

313
00:11:32,940 --> 00:11:36,180
difference so there's a lot of math

314
00:11:34,320 --> 00:11:38,130
books are there right the one I would

315
00:11:36,180 --> 00:11:39,569
sort of a commanded that guy right it's

316
00:11:38,130 --> 00:11:42,000
terrible again it's to be painted for

317
00:11:39,570 --> 00:11:43,380
now for J but it's the one that really

318
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:46,050
clicked is the one that read that you're

319
00:11:43,380 --> 00:11:47,700
going I'll be working in graphs for the

320
00:11:46,050 --> 00:11:49,979
last ten years right I never realized

321
00:11:47,700 --> 00:11:51,420
that right so it's really good right I

322
00:11:49,980 --> 00:11:53,620
think has a real good sort of

323
00:11:51,420 --> 00:11:56,620
explanation of graph theory and

324
00:11:53,620 --> 00:11:58,360
and other stuff so I'll do that I saw

325
00:11:56,620 --> 00:12:00,460
these great presentation a couple days

326
00:11:58,360 --> 00:12:02,410
ago brought these guys to talk about

327
00:12:00,460 --> 00:12:04,420
what Ellen must taught me about growing

328
00:12:02,410 --> 00:12:07,569
a business right and the thing that

329
00:12:04,420 --> 00:12:09,430
Ellen most said to him was every person

330
00:12:07,570 --> 00:12:11,320
in your come is a vector right and the

331
00:12:09,430 --> 00:12:14,560
progress is determined by the sum of

332
00:12:11,320 --> 00:12:16,060
those vectors so the way DUI cure if

333
00:12:14,560 --> 00:12:17,619
you're talking about a graph the

334
00:12:16,060 --> 00:12:19,569
direction on your graphs and the

335
00:12:17,620 --> 00:12:21,790
connections of your graphs and how they

336
00:12:19,570 --> 00:12:24,190
go down makes a big difference so the

337
00:12:21,790 --> 00:12:26,339
analogy here is that so you try that if

338
00:12:24,190 --> 00:12:28,630
you have four people may not even be

339
00:12:26,339 --> 00:12:30,160
seven tomorrow you'll never mind right

340
00:12:28,630 --> 00:12:32,410
they know that's a one to ten are they

341
00:12:30,160 --> 00:12:34,660
all brilliant people they are super you

342
00:12:32,410 --> 00:12:37,270
know effective in the real world but

343
00:12:34,660 --> 00:12:39,310
they align in their objectives so you

344
00:12:37,270 --> 00:12:41,140
have almost zero impact and sometimes

345
00:12:39,310 --> 00:12:43,599
this happens there's three people in one

346
00:12:41,140 --> 00:12:45,970
direction one is Amy backwards the other

347
00:12:43,600 --> 00:12:47,470
one's kind of going south right and and

348
00:12:45,970 --> 00:12:49,660
and eventually you don't have the

349
00:12:47,470 --> 00:12:51,339
possible team the best thing is when you

350
00:12:49,660 --> 00:12:54,160
have that when you have the alignment of

351
00:12:51,339 --> 00:12:55,900
your efforts your your activities and

352
00:12:54,160 --> 00:12:58,240
what you're doing right and again in in

353
00:12:55,900 --> 00:13:00,160
the team in half and this is Stephen

354
00:12:58,240 --> 00:13:01,600
grants right this is thinking about the

355
00:13:00,160 --> 00:13:05,680
vectors the connections to where you

356
00:13:01,600 --> 00:13:07,900
actually align your joint environment so

357
00:13:05,680 --> 00:13:09,400
I work please welcome to call security

358
00:13:07,900 --> 00:13:11,110
mention where I was developing a car

359
00:13:09,400 --> 00:13:13,300
called team mentor right and this is

360
00:13:11,110 --> 00:13:15,779
very interesting right because I was

361
00:13:13,300 --> 00:13:17,229
bleeding out an architect on this

362
00:13:15,779 --> 00:13:18,790
application

363
00:13:17,230 --> 00:13:21,730
who chair looks like this it's kind of a

364
00:13:18,790 --> 00:13:24,459
knowledge base and we asked cool it has

365
00:13:21,730 --> 00:13:26,260
like a structure here the left we got

366
00:13:24,459 --> 00:13:27,729
some filters and then you got some

367
00:13:26,260 --> 00:13:29,410
results and then he would pick some

368
00:13:27,730 --> 00:13:30,730
Sundays ago like that you cook today

369
00:13:29,410 --> 00:13:33,519
get some guidance in the middle right

370
00:13:30,730 --> 00:13:35,529
what thinking about this was that the

371
00:13:33,519 --> 00:13:36,279
first version was seeker base was

372
00:13:35,529 --> 00:13:38,740
database-driven

373
00:13:36,279 --> 00:13:40,600
and this is the irony right like this

374
00:13:38,740 --> 00:13:42,970
was on a relational database right but

375
00:13:40,600 --> 00:13:45,459
the problem is relational databases suck

376
00:13:42,970 --> 00:13:47,829
at relationships right they're not very

377
00:13:45,459 --> 00:13:49,479
good because once they get to some level

378
00:13:47,829 --> 00:13:51,430
complexity you can actually slow down

379
00:13:49,480 --> 00:13:53,110
right and then it gets interesting

380
00:13:51,430 --> 00:13:55,300
because related races sometimes are not

381
00:13:53,110 --> 00:13:56,949
that good and in the key indexing

382
00:13:55,300 --> 00:14:01,479
searches right then you have a nice hash

383
00:13:56,949 --> 00:14:03,910
place database so there you go so what

384
00:14:01,480 --> 00:14:06,790
we're teaching about this is that we

385
00:14:03,910 --> 00:14:09,730
when we develop a new version we took

386
00:14:06,790 --> 00:14:11,980
that model we had and we basically build

387
00:14:09,730 --> 00:14:15,129
a trap and the way we actually did it is

388
00:14:11,980 --> 00:14:17,110
we started we evolve the graph into this

389
00:14:15,129 --> 00:14:18,879
so what we actually did was and there

390
00:14:17,110 --> 00:14:20,410
you can certainly even the search was

391
00:14:18,879 --> 00:14:23,170
very invented because the previous

392
00:14:20,410 --> 00:14:24,610
search really sucked right and it was

393
00:14:23,170 --> 00:14:26,979
very interesting that when we would be

394
00:14:24,610 --> 00:14:29,920
back revisit the search having a graph

395
00:14:26,980 --> 00:14:31,660
we were to do very very steep stuff we

396
00:14:29,920 --> 00:14:34,329
able to do all sorts of weighted filters

397
00:14:31,660 --> 00:14:36,100
we able to gain the system be able to

398
00:14:34,329 --> 00:14:39,819
pick certain queries we were to make

399
00:14:36,100 --> 00:14:41,380
connections much simpler way then if you

400
00:14:39,819 --> 00:14:44,349
was a relational database or if the data

401
00:14:41,380 --> 00:14:46,269
was not properly normalized so what I

402
00:14:44,350 --> 00:14:50,769
did for that is I start to visualize it

403
00:14:46,269 --> 00:14:53,740
like this so that is what this looks

404
00:14:50,769 --> 00:14:56,439
like so actually these dots here are

405
00:14:53,740 --> 00:14:58,209
actually articles not be clear some of

406
00:14:56,439 --> 00:15:00,130
the air so even so this is an early

407
00:14:58,209 --> 00:15:02,138
picture but what you can already see is

408
00:15:00,130 --> 00:15:04,389
from temple here we had a whole bunch of

409
00:15:02,139 --> 00:15:06,730
areas that we had not a lot of articles

410
00:15:04,389 --> 00:15:09,029
so it was really interesting that we

411
00:15:06,730 --> 00:15:11,920
even found a lot of gaps in our own

412
00:15:09,029 --> 00:15:14,620
knowledge base for example that were not

413
00:15:11,920 --> 00:15:17,139
obvious at all once we were not viewing

414
00:15:14,620 --> 00:15:19,920
the content as a crowd so it was really

415
00:15:17,139 --> 00:15:21,060
extreme that presented that

416
00:15:19,920 --> 00:15:22,650
and this is a really cool way to do it

417
00:15:21,060 --> 00:15:24,810
right before you do is you use like a

418
00:15:22,650 --> 00:15:26,670
gravity so basically what it means is

419
00:15:24,810 --> 00:15:28,680
each of those now is pulling each other

420
00:15:26,670 --> 00:15:31,530
so they kind of have this sort of effect

421
00:15:28,680 --> 00:15:34,380
where it sort of visualizes quite nicely

422
00:15:31,530 --> 00:15:36,000
right so anything that resembles an

423
00:15:34,380 --> 00:15:36,630
example like here the tag to match to

424
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:38,340
check please

425
00:15:36,630 --> 00:15:40,560
I can org I got it maps too much

426
00:15:38,340 --> 00:15:42,120
particle price so this is a really

427
00:15:40,560 --> 00:15:44,459
interesting way to visualize it and

428
00:15:42,120 --> 00:15:46,950
these actually help us to design not on

429
00:15:44,460 --> 00:15:48,570
the application default schema and not

430
00:15:46,950 --> 00:15:50,670
you allowed to go into the server and

431
00:15:48,570 --> 00:15:53,820
I'm actually in serious but this is

432
00:15:50,670 --> 00:15:56,010
actually one article and all the

433
00:15:53,820 --> 00:15:59,280
existing connection between those

434
00:15:56,010 --> 00:16:02,000
articles right I think I really learned

435
00:15:59,280 --> 00:16:05,520
about this was that when you do a graph

436
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:07,350
the the one the mistakes sometimes I see

437
00:16:05,520 --> 00:16:08,579
is that you want to lower your name

438
00:16:07,350 --> 00:16:10,230
right it's almost like you want to build

439
00:16:08,580 --> 00:16:11,910
the uber graph right you want to like

440
00:16:10,230 --> 00:16:13,290
you want to have this thing especially

441
00:16:11,910 --> 00:16:15,390
now it sometimes you know it's quite

442
00:16:13,290 --> 00:16:17,430
cheap to create terabytes of stuff it's

443
00:16:15,390 --> 00:16:19,140
like you particularly rolling right and

444
00:16:17,430 --> 00:16:21,569
then you want to start creating action

445
00:16:19,140 --> 00:16:24,240
the problem is test too much noise so

446
00:16:21,570 --> 00:16:26,100
it's almost like the evolution of a

447
00:16:24,240 --> 00:16:29,160
graph is like even just a transformation

448
00:16:26,100 --> 00:16:30,960
of data into a graph like format it's

449
00:16:29,160 --> 00:16:32,969
already very valuable in fact that's a

450
00:16:30,960 --> 00:16:35,520
part of your design and what you can do

451
00:16:32,970 --> 00:16:37,230
is you create sometimes chain graphs is

452
00:16:35,520 --> 00:16:38,910
really the first one that allows you to

453
00:16:37,230 --> 00:16:40,140
get to a certain state didn't you you

454
00:16:38,910 --> 00:16:42,060
already can normalize that into another

455
00:16:40,140 --> 00:16:43,650
one and the power of graphs is they

456
00:16:42,060 --> 00:16:45,180
allow you to do that and they were so

457
00:16:43,650 --> 00:16:47,640
they allowed to hyperlink things so you

458
00:16:45,180 --> 00:16:49,650
can Sam a massive data store here that

459
00:16:47,640 --> 00:16:51,600
has some small connections to this other

460
00:16:49,650 --> 00:16:54,720
one but it's very easy to navigate

461
00:16:51,600 --> 00:16:56,430
because grab you can fly it to a graph

462
00:16:54,720 --> 00:16:59,460
very easily because almost like you're

463
00:16:56,430 --> 00:17:00,959
just doing key pair resolutions so it

464
00:16:59,460 --> 00:17:02,790
was very interesting when we do this so

465
00:17:00,960 --> 00:17:04,680
we actually can then think about how we

466
00:17:02,790 --> 00:17:06,510
want to see the data how he laughs how

467
00:17:04,680 --> 00:17:08,339
the structure connects to each other and

468
00:17:06,510 --> 00:17:10,500
how everything fits for this world is

469
00:17:08,339 --> 00:17:12,419
you guys know now we use this tool time

470
00:17:10,500 --> 00:17:14,699
called ever graph which is kind of based

471
00:17:12,420 --> 00:17:16,829
on triplets so again on on graph theory

472
00:17:14,699 --> 00:17:18,689
I really like this one so it means is

473
00:17:16,829 --> 00:17:20,220
for every node and edge you create a

474
00:17:18,689 --> 00:17:20,589
triplet which basically means that you

475
00:17:20,220 --> 00:17:22,990
make

476
00:17:20,589 --> 00:17:25,270
connection between these nodes and that

477
00:17:22,990 --> 00:17:27,640
nodes and actually that node and we

478
00:17:25,270 --> 00:17:30,129
sound and then the actual thing in the

479
00:17:27,640 --> 00:17:32,020
middle which is basically the edge right

480
00:17:30,130 --> 00:17:34,090
so he's very easy because the actually

481
00:17:32,020 --> 00:17:36,279
allows you for every entry that you

482
00:17:34,090 --> 00:17:38,529
create you can ask the question so you

483
00:17:36,279 --> 00:17:40,150
can say alright if I go from here

484
00:17:38,529 --> 00:17:41,500
where do I go to these guys or you can

485
00:17:40,150 --> 00:17:43,240
go to a node and say actually loop

486
00:17:41,500 --> 00:17:44,919
connects to this but you can also go on

487
00:17:43,240 --> 00:17:46,480
relationships okay who has this

488
00:17:44,919 --> 00:17:48,309
relationship and then give me all the

489
00:17:46,480 --> 00:17:50,320
nodes that map this relationship so it's

490
00:17:48,309 --> 00:17:52,149
a really cool way of doing it so it's

491
00:17:50,320 --> 00:17:53,350
basically and if one of those I feels

492
00:17:52,150 --> 00:17:55,779
inefficient because you're creating

493
00:17:53,350 --> 00:17:57,969
three connections per item that you out

494
00:17:55,779 --> 00:17:59,950
but that pays by itself every time

495
00:17:57,970 --> 00:18:01,240
you're gonna do repair it so it makes a

496
00:17:59,950 --> 00:18:03,100
massive massive different any scheme

497
00:18:01,240 --> 00:18:04,659
scale that is actually it's very cheap

498
00:18:03,100 --> 00:18:06,279
to store this kind of stuff right so

499
00:18:04,659 --> 00:18:08,049
yeah there's Tipler and for example

500
00:18:06,279 --> 00:18:09,789
there's results right so he did a

501
00:18:08,049 --> 00:18:11,139
national example of the kind of Celtic

502
00:18:09,789 --> 00:18:13,690
stuff it's very complex there's you

503
00:18:11,140 --> 00:18:15,909
goanna navigate by the tail leaving all

504
00:18:13,690 --> 00:18:17,380
the friends that are French that human

505
00:18:15,909 --> 00:18:20,110
and friends that are friends together

506
00:18:17,380 --> 00:18:21,399
then you get that stuff right so and you

507
00:18:20,110 --> 00:18:23,439
get to see the answer there right so

508
00:18:21,399 --> 00:18:24,820
that's basically that's so for the

509
00:18:23,440 --> 00:18:26,649
subject here of course now the

510
00:18:24,820 --> 00:18:28,570
predicates gonna be the very middle so

511
00:18:26,649 --> 00:18:30,699
will be friend of so in the day that you

512
00:18:28,570 --> 00:18:33,070
actually have since like the pair is

513
00:18:30,700 --> 00:18:37,299
friend of Danielle right just like that

514
00:18:33,070 --> 00:18:38,770
so very powerful I also use these desks

515
00:18:37,299 --> 00:18:40,600
to visualize this stuff which is really

516
00:18:38,770 --> 00:18:43,210
cool it today is it kind of element a

517
00:18:40,600 --> 00:18:44,980
JavaScript based framework well you

518
00:18:43,210 --> 00:18:46,270
can't see on valuations that you can

519
00:18:44,980 --> 00:18:48,190
actually move over the little things I

520
00:18:46,270 --> 00:18:49,330
need so then of those things make a

521
00:18:48,190 --> 00:18:51,880
little difference right the fact that

522
00:18:49,330 --> 00:18:53,770
you can actually zoom in zoom out move

523
00:18:51,880 --> 00:18:56,289
things around right actually many be

524
00:18:53,770 --> 00:18:58,480
different so um it's quite cool enough

525
00:18:56,289 --> 00:19:00,309
to JavaScript so again red super fast so

526
00:18:58,480 --> 00:19:01,480
the logic we need visualization is

527
00:19:00,309 --> 00:19:03,850
really the process saying now

528
00:19:01,480 --> 00:19:05,980
experimenter Jason visualize it on Vijay

529
00:19:03,850 --> 00:19:09,158
so now we're get into Jared conflict

530
00:19:05,980 --> 00:19:10,720
right now anyway this is so the first

531
00:19:09,159 --> 00:19:12,220
part is to kind of show that you know

532
00:19:10,720 --> 00:19:15,059
there's a lot of graphs around right so

533
00:19:12,220 --> 00:19:18,370
hopefully you get me that idea I mean

534
00:19:15,059 --> 00:19:22,570
one of the things that we do with JIRA

535
00:19:18,370 --> 00:19:25,570
and confluence is is we use JIRA as a

536
00:19:22,570 --> 00:19:27,820
graph database because you need to take

537
00:19:25,570 --> 00:19:29,649
a step back right so what do you want

538
00:19:27,820 --> 00:19:30,379
from a graph database right you want a

539
00:19:29,649 --> 00:19:32,270
place that you

540
00:19:30,380 --> 00:19:34,460
joke notes it like you we want something

541
00:19:32,270 --> 00:19:36,800
right let's say this guy right you you

542
00:19:34,460 --> 00:19:38,570
need to throw it something then you need

543
00:19:36,800 --> 00:19:40,700
to be able to idea in version control it

544
00:19:38,570 --> 00:19:41,300
so you can see the evolution and then in

545
00:19:40,700 --> 00:19:42,980
each one

546
00:19:41,300 --> 00:19:45,770
I nearly start to add some metadata to

547
00:19:42,980 --> 00:19:47,660
it and so you can say this are some

548
00:19:45,770 --> 00:19:49,010
property this has some stuff to it

549
00:19:47,660 --> 00:19:51,590
and you're going to be able to link to

550
00:19:49,010 --> 00:19:53,270
another one weed something that

551
00:19:51,590 --> 00:19:55,370
represents that linkage right so I can

552
00:19:53,270 --> 00:19:57,410
say this is related to that one or maybe

553
00:19:55,370 --> 00:19:58,699
this risk it's that one or this is a

554
00:19:57,410 --> 00:20:01,340
parent of that one

555
00:19:58,700 --> 00:20:03,650
so this that's basically what you want

556
00:20:01,340 --> 00:20:05,510
to graph their necks so you're spending

557
00:20:03,650 --> 00:20:06,740
that was using jira pylori there one day

558
00:20:05,510 --> 00:20:08,420
I realized actually this is interesting

559
00:20:06,740 --> 00:20:10,490
we're actually using it as a graph

560
00:20:08,420 --> 00:20:12,380
database because if you look at this we

561
00:20:10,490 --> 00:20:14,240
have our global key in this case that's

562
00:20:12,380 --> 00:20:15,650
the risk right that's three global key

563
00:20:14,240 --> 00:20:18,230
that's the unique identifier for this

564
00:20:15,650 --> 00:20:18,800
and then we start to add labels that's

565
00:20:18,230 --> 00:20:20,540
cool

566
00:20:18,800 --> 00:20:22,820
we have extra a community so this is

567
00:20:20,540 --> 00:20:25,190
already attributes that we particularly

568
00:20:22,820 --> 00:20:27,200
added you can then have the word clothes

569
00:20:25,190 --> 00:20:28,970
which already show the word clothes you

570
00:20:27,200 --> 00:20:31,340
can have assignments you can have the

571
00:20:28,970 --> 00:20:33,050
timestamps and you can in this case you

572
00:20:31,340 --> 00:20:34,909
have linked back to a particular epic so

573
00:20:33,050 --> 00:20:36,740
this is the case where we have some

574
00:20:34,910 --> 00:20:39,350
infected machine downloaded a virus

575
00:20:36,740 --> 00:20:40,370
right kind of typical sort of stuff that

576
00:20:39,350 --> 00:20:41,750
you get right

577
00:20:40,370 --> 00:20:44,600
so these thinking about this is that

578
00:20:41,750 --> 00:20:47,150
this is part of now an epic right and

579
00:20:44,600 --> 00:20:50,449
the epic now contains a pile of risks

580
00:20:47,150 --> 00:20:53,450
but it also contains all the tasks and

581
00:20:50,450 --> 00:20:54,920
done now some of you Maruyama heart

582
00:20:53,450 --> 00:20:58,070
attack by the number of tasks that we

583
00:20:54,920 --> 00:20:59,510
have right so this is this actually even

584
00:20:58,070 --> 00:21:01,129
all of it but we have more ugly just

585
00:20:59,510 --> 00:21:03,620
when I was pressed to the end right this

586
00:21:01,130 --> 00:21:05,450
is every many times that we create so

587
00:21:03,620 --> 00:21:08,810
we're getting to the point where we

588
00:21:05,450 --> 00:21:11,570
opening up tasks to questions because we

589
00:21:08,810 --> 00:21:13,909
are so efficient a hand on that right

590
00:21:11,570 --> 00:21:15,860
now the point of doing this is and

591
00:21:13,910 --> 00:21:18,290
that's the power of a graph right we go

592
00:21:15,860 --> 00:21:20,810
to the point where we have one incidence

593
00:21:18,290 --> 00:21:23,659
which spins off the epic who tracks that

594
00:21:20,810 --> 00:21:25,820
and there will create literally 20 tasks

595
00:21:23,660 --> 00:21:27,680
that come out of it but you know like

596
00:21:25,820 --> 00:21:29,450
you know the thing about this is you

597
00:21:27,680 --> 00:21:30,830
were all do it the problem is you and

598
00:21:29,450 --> 00:21:32,990
Ivan normalize those tasks

599
00:21:30,830 --> 00:21:34,970
they'll be on somebody's head right and

600
00:21:32,990 --> 00:21:35,430
then it's a problem because you go happy

601
00:21:34,970 --> 00:21:36,690
done

602
00:21:35,430 --> 00:21:38,430
have you done this where are you where's

603
00:21:36,690 --> 00:21:40,110
the status etc becomes a nightmare to

604
00:21:38,430 --> 00:21:43,260
them tank so because we actually have a

605
00:21:40,110 --> 00:21:45,419
team behind our business we get the

606
00:21:43,260 --> 00:21:48,240
point where we open Brazilians of tasks

607
00:21:45,420 --> 00:21:50,190
because we want to be very explicit with

608
00:21:48,240 --> 00:21:51,990
the questions that we ask have we done

609
00:21:50,190 --> 00:21:54,090
this have you checked this was there PII

610
00:21:51,990 --> 00:21:56,400
data there was that this where was it

611
00:21:54,090 --> 00:21:58,770
bah bah bah etc so we go very very

612
00:21:56,400 --> 00:22:00,060
distinct because what we then do and by

613
00:21:58,770 --> 00:22:04,920
the way this is where you understand a

614
00:22:00,060 --> 00:22:08,639
for example juror is great to hold data

615
00:22:04,920 --> 00:22:10,470
it sucks it's showing there right so you

616
00:22:08,640 --> 00:22:12,750
cannot use that like the problem with

617
00:22:10,470 --> 00:22:15,150
that epoch is once you have more than 10

618
00:22:12,750 --> 00:22:17,910
she becomes unusable because for some

619
00:22:15,150 --> 00:22:19,680
reason that nice thing I decided that

620
00:22:17,910 --> 00:22:22,080
filtering this thing is not a priority

621
00:22:19,680 --> 00:22:23,490
you know and I keep going myself to

622
00:22:22,080 --> 00:22:26,280
fighting a bargain and going through the

623
00:22:23,490 --> 00:22:28,110
question many listened and people asked

624
00:22:26,280 --> 00:22:30,660
me for the last 10 years and there's

625
00:22:28,110 --> 00:22:33,000
always an idea they are going really 10

626
00:22:30,660 --> 00:22:34,530
years to a DS feature right so there's a

627
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:37,560
policy like to this is one of them right

628
00:22:34,530 --> 00:22:38,850
so the point here is that you can't kill

629
00:22:37,560 --> 00:22:41,700
to this and you cannot do other stuff

630
00:22:38,850 --> 00:22:43,770
but what we do is we doing conflicts so

631
00:22:41,700 --> 00:22:46,080
what we do is we actually create what we

632
00:22:43,770 --> 00:22:47,910
call these fat pages and it's really

633
00:22:46,080 --> 00:22:49,590
this is quite spectacular because what

634
00:22:47,910 --> 00:22:52,920
we now have is we have a real-time

635
00:22:49,590 --> 00:22:55,050
update of an incident right and we do

636
00:22:52,920 --> 00:22:57,180
this now almost every day virtually for

637
00:22:55,050 --> 00:22:59,010
the ESA's that we have so and you can

638
00:22:57,180 --> 00:23:01,350
see that you got and we have separate

639
00:22:59,010 --> 00:23:03,750
executive summaries we map stuff to get

640
00:23:01,350 --> 00:23:05,580
the tasks and basically and there's all

641
00:23:03,750 --> 00:23:08,820
the mappings on here what is really

642
00:23:05,580 --> 00:23:11,070
powerful this is that this part here

643
00:23:08,820 --> 00:23:14,159
which is protects you that much is these

644
00:23:11,070 --> 00:23:20,550
are the questions that we want that tax

645
00:23:14,160 --> 00:23:22,260
response actually comes from I have

646
00:23:20,550 --> 00:23:24,000
another side of show that so that's why

647
00:23:22,260 --> 00:23:27,060
that response actually comes from the

648
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:29,520
ticket so when we open all those issues

649
00:23:27,060 --> 00:23:31,169
we we have a particular thread about a

650
00:23:29,520 --> 00:23:33,450
specific issue and then we have a

651
00:23:31,170 --> 00:23:34,620
specific field which the tax response so

652
00:23:33,450 --> 00:23:37,470
if we think about from another point of

653
00:23:34,620 --> 00:23:38,459
view who then not fear so on this page I

654
00:23:37,470 --> 00:23:40,529
can actually see

655
00:23:38,460 --> 00:23:43,259
so I want more details I can click in

656
00:23:40,529 --> 00:23:46,889
here I can go in today so basically you

657
00:23:43,259 --> 00:23:49,740
can see that you use your as a database

658
00:23:46,889 --> 00:23:51,209
and use comp as a way to view stuff so

659
00:23:49,740 --> 00:23:53,129
here's the page where you actually see

660
00:23:51,210 --> 00:23:55,019
who's assigned to what and who's posed

661
00:23:53,129 --> 00:23:57,449
to be doing on so not page for example

662
00:23:55,019 --> 00:23:59,399
will show all the tasks that are pending

663
00:23:57,450 --> 00:24:00,899
and who's been assigned to that task

664
00:23:59,399 --> 00:24:03,508
which win again when you have a

665
00:24:00,899 --> 00:24:06,178
distributed team sounds simple it gets

666
00:24:03,509 --> 00:24:07,139
very complex very quickly in fact I see

667
00:24:06,179 --> 00:24:08,970
a lot of places where you have these

668
00:24:07,139 --> 00:24:10,979
massive slash on all these everybody's

669
00:24:08,970 --> 00:24:12,720
for compiling on it and it's a freaking

670
00:24:10,980 --> 00:24:15,389
nightmare right do you even know where

671
00:24:12,720 --> 00:24:17,279
are we who is that more how can I help

672
00:24:15,389 --> 00:24:18,719
what's the latest facts what's the

673
00:24:17,279 --> 00:24:20,999
situation on this right there's always

674
00:24:18,720 --> 00:24:22,379
somebody arriving letting go hey what's

675
00:24:20,999 --> 00:24:24,629
going on right in the end the whole

676
00:24:22,379 --> 00:24:26,639
freaking thing starts right so this

677
00:24:24,629 --> 00:24:30,360
solves our problem the other thing that

678
00:24:26,639 --> 00:24:32,729
we do is we hyperlink arrests right so

679
00:24:30,360 --> 00:24:34,110
when we have a risk basically we have

680
00:24:32,730 --> 00:24:36,330
the high level rate so separately

681
00:24:34,110 --> 00:24:37,918
secured now access controls who leads to

682
00:24:36,330 --> 00:24:39,629
another level risk which is nice if your

683
00:24:37,919 --> 00:24:41,820
factory who links to another one

684
00:24:39,629 --> 00:24:43,980
specifically brands who actually links

685
00:24:41,820 --> 00:24:45,720
to the monitors themselves so what we

686
00:24:43,980 --> 00:24:48,809
have is we have this graph made

687
00:24:45,720 --> 00:24:51,149
structure that allows to go from one

688
00:24:48,809 --> 00:24:52,769
whore ability all the way to the height

689
00:24:51,149 --> 00:24:55,110
that the immediate level of rested I

690
00:24:52,769 --> 00:24:57,059
implies all the way to the business rest

691
00:24:55,110 --> 00:24:59,428
and all these business risks will have

692
00:24:57,059 --> 00:25:01,470
to be accepted or allocated for fixed by

693
00:24:59,429 --> 00:25:03,720
the business and the higher you go the

694
00:25:01,470 --> 00:25:06,269
higher in a way that the org chart

695
00:25:03,720 --> 00:25:08,309
you start to see them so the cool thing

696
00:25:06,269 --> 00:25:10,710
this is a high level risk are the ones

697
00:25:08,309 --> 00:25:12,690
that I will take to the board is the one

698
00:25:10,710 --> 00:25:14,759
that says this is our global level of

699
00:25:12,690 --> 00:25:17,580
risk on the organization and it's all

700
00:25:14,759 --> 00:25:19,799
fact dates but this is very powerful

701
00:25:17,580 --> 00:25:21,269
because he means that when something

702
00:25:19,799 --> 00:25:24,990
change the new variability something

703
00:25:21,269 --> 00:25:26,309
happens the entire tree gets affected so

704
00:25:24,990 --> 00:25:29,610
this is where you need to think about it

705
00:25:26,309 --> 00:25:32,610
you now have a graph based vulnerability

706
00:25:29,610 --> 00:25:36,840
and risk based management system which

707
00:25:32,610 --> 00:25:39,869
which is really really cool and any

708
00:25:36,840 --> 00:25:42,408
questions I know you guys trying to get

709
00:25:39,869 --> 00:25:42,408
ahead on it

710
00:25:42,630 --> 00:25:51,610
sorry what look everything I'm so now

711
00:25:48,600 --> 00:25:52,899
yeah because okay yes because this is

712
00:25:51,610 --> 00:25:54,939
releasing the Creative Commons so

713
00:25:52,900 --> 00:25:57,580
there's no idea here that you can use so

714
00:25:54,940 --> 00:25:59,920
there's nothing apart from needing

715
00:25:57,580 --> 00:26:02,590
conference in JIRA right there's nothing

716
00:25:59,920 --> 00:26:04,660
you need to do right Alice right because

717
00:26:02,590 --> 00:26:13,510
I put that now haven't show you anything

718
00:26:04,660 --> 00:26:17,950
that's proprietary no no this is this is

719
00:26:13,510 --> 00:26:19,750
just a view of unconference actually you

720
00:26:17,950 --> 00:26:24,280
can speak to this because we'll be shirt

721
00:26:19,750 --> 00:26:25,600
here right but we heard so but there's a

722
00:26:24,280 --> 00:26:29,110
bunch of people actual change and

723
00:26:25,600 --> 00:26:31,959
general there and general they talk to

724
00:26:29,110 --> 00:26:33,879
them they'll gladly show the well look

725
00:26:31,960 --> 00:26:35,500
is that you know they they have my

726
00:26:33,880 --> 00:26:39,130
permission to share all this stuff okay

727
00:26:35,500 --> 00:26:41,920
and such project I'm doing for the next

728
00:26:39,130 --> 00:26:44,230
week I'm going to show you so but I

729
00:26:41,920 --> 00:26:46,480
think we should be working us as a

730
00:26:44,230 --> 00:26:48,430
community right because I think there's

731
00:26:46,480 --> 00:26:50,230
a lot of cool ideas done but there's a

732
00:26:48,430 --> 00:26:52,000
lot of I sympathy for other and the guys

733
00:26:50,230 --> 00:26:53,380
who use are the teams using for simple

734
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:56,080
cheering with each new wife I think we

735
00:26:53,380 --> 00:26:57,490
need to share this a bit better and I've

736
00:26:56,080 --> 00:26:59,770
done that a birth of these using get

737
00:26:57,490 --> 00:27:02,410
help right which is also quite

738
00:26:59,770 --> 00:27:03,820
interesting to you have I liked somebody

739
00:27:02,410 --> 00:27:05,320
get up stuff doesn't have work clothes

740
00:27:03,820 --> 00:27:08,740
but you can do the same thing what you

741
00:27:05,320 --> 00:27:10,419
have for the other ones I gave up to be

742
00:27:08,740 --> 00:27:12,250
honest every time I see things like

743
00:27:10,420 --> 00:27:15,220
service now and some of the other ones

744
00:27:12,250 --> 00:27:19,560
you like I just open one ticket which is

745
00:27:15,220 --> 00:27:23,490
moved to github on move to joy

746
00:27:19,560 --> 00:27:25,379
because you know maybe the new verses do

747
00:27:23,490 --> 00:27:27,480
that but it's just like you know there's

748
00:27:25,380 --> 00:27:30,900
like a dead key feature that they just

749
00:27:27,480 --> 00:27:34,230
miss right so so okay so if you see that

750
00:27:30,900 --> 00:27:36,030
we use confluence to do today right so

751
00:27:34,230 --> 00:27:37,470
this is for example of status we might

752
00:27:36,030 --> 00:27:39,810
call the rest you can see where they are

753
00:27:37,470 --> 00:27:41,880
we can see the status their end and and

754
00:27:39,810 --> 00:27:44,370
this is kind of a nice picture to loose

755
00:27:41,880 --> 00:27:46,500
in here of how we kind of handle our

756
00:27:44,370 --> 00:27:48,629
events right so what we do is we have

757
00:27:46,500 --> 00:27:50,490
the event that comes in we create this

758
00:27:48,630 --> 00:27:52,170
isn't so this is already something that

759
00:27:50,490 --> 00:27:53,780
the business is already doing which is

760
00:27:52,170 --> 00:27:56,550
actually quite cool we actually get

761
00:27:53,780 --> 00:27:59,490
individual tabs on it individual team

762
00:27:56,550 --> 00:28:01,470
members outside secured open an incident

763
00:27:59,490 --> 00:28:03,180
right so which of the open ticket with

764
00:28:01,470 --> 00:28:05,070
the information even customer service is

765
00:28:03,180 --> 00:28:06,570
doing that which is really nice and then

766
00:28:05,070 --> 00:28:08,730
what we'll do is you have a dedicated

767
00:28:06,570 --> 00:28:09,929
team which are talking a second but they

768
00:28:08,730 --> 00:28:12,000
do it straightaway they will create

769
00:28:09,930 --> 00:28:13,950
actually epic that match the whole thing

770
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:15,360
and then we start to map all the issues

771
00:28:13,950 --> 00:28:18,660
and taxis are the ones that will create

772
00:28:15,360 --> 00:28:20,969
twenty thirty forty per event and again

773
00:28:18,660 --> 00:28:22,620
the more the better because actually the

774
00:28:20,970 --> 00:28:24,630
more granular you go with the questions

775
00:28:22,620 --> 00:28:26,879
the more objective and the more focus

776
00:28:24,630 --> 00:28:28,680
you are these together day and then we

777
00:28:26,880 --> 00:28:31,770
have our I believe version of risks and

778
00:28:28,680 --> 00:28:34,950
then the magic of all of this happens

779
00:28:31,770 --> 00:28:36,480
when you capture this in the flavor so

780
00:28:34,950 --> 00:28:38,250
the playbook which is something that for

781
00:28:36,480 --> 00:28:40,860
the guys who went to the last summit we

782
00:28:38,250 --> 00:28:42,750
start to work on it becomes this sort of

783
00:28:40,860 --> 00:28:44,129
what to do so the reason why it's

784
00:28:42,750 --> 00:28:46,110
worried it would have opened twenty

785
00:28:44,130 --> 00:28:48,450
tasks went away is where we already know

786
00:28:46,110 --> 00:28:50,879
we already done some of these exercises

787
00:28:48,450 --> 00:28:54,000
so we already know that the ten tasks or

788
00:28:50,880 --> 00:28:56,490
the 15 tasks that we want to do when

789
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:58,980
this incident occurred so this is where

790
00:28:56,490 --> 00:29:00,360
this becomes less of an art and becomes

791
00:28:58,980 --> 00:29:02,310
proper engineering becomes proper

792
00:29:00,360 --> 00:29:04,770
processes where in reality is that

793
00:29:02,310 --> 00:29:06,659
already be a situation where every

794
00:29:04,770 --> 00:29:08,550
Eastern that that hits us we already

795
00:29:06,660 --> 00:29:10,290
know the next ten questions and we

796
00:29:08,550 --> 00:29:12,389
already know depending on where it goes

797
00:29:10,290 --> 00:29:13,110
what are the next set of questions know

798
00:29:12,390 --> 00:29:15,150
we need to answer

799
00:29:13,110 --> 00:29:17,010
so the playbook which is again something

800
00:29:15,150 --> 00:29:18,370
that we should be working to get as a

801
00:29:17,010 --> 00:29:20,559
community and I'm happy

802
00:29:18,370 --> 00:29:22,149
share all these stuff is that knowing

803
00:29:20,559 --> 00:29:24,160
everyone allurement from everybody and

804
00:29:22,150 --> 00:29:26,890
you know we collectively are much more

805
00:29:24,160 --> 00:29:28,420
but strong and this is where the magic

806
00:29:26,890 --> 00:29:30,220
should be right this is should be

807
00:29:28,420 --> 00:29:33,190
normalize it and this also so that's how

808
00:29:30,220 --> 00:29:35,860
you use certain tools so and for example

809
00:29:33,190 --> 00:29:38,350
on the the recent endeavor PA the world

810
00:29:35,860 --> 00:29:40,840
is falling kind of you know stock right

811
00:29:38,350 --> 00:29:42,939
that happened recently this was a good

812
00:29:40,840 --> 00:29:44,949
example right we mapped it out we looked

813
00:29:42,940 --> 00:29:46,540
at some of the guys looked at us and we

814
00:29:44,950 --> 00:29:50,230
create a whole bunch of stuff so he's

815
00:29:46,540 --> 00:29:54,040
that example right of the talus playbook

816
00:29:50,230 --> 00:29:55,990
that comes from here right suppose mo

817
00:29:54,040 --> 00:29:57,309
he's a question asked we use doctrine so

818
00:29:55,990 --> 00:29:59,140
thank you guys who's not racist writing

819
00:29:57,309 --> 00:30:01,570
sneaks the technology the question that

820
00:29:59,140 --> 00:30:03,520
I asked was will he pick it up right

821
00:30:01,570 --> 00:30:05,980
that was one of my questions over ml

822
00:30:03,520 --> 00:30:09,309
like because doctors is one of our early

823
00:30:05,980 --> 00:30:11,980
warning signs I I want to know does

824
00:30:09,309 --> 00:30:14,200
doctors pick up this particular set of

825
00:30:11,980 --> 00:30:16,120
activities I created a strategy which

826
00:30:14,200 --> 00:30:18,940
was based on five pillars and you see

827
00:30:16,120 --> 00:30:20,770
again how this becomes a graph so um I

828
00:30:18,940 --> 00:30:22,510
have a neighbor filler here which is all

829
00:30:20,770 --> 00:30:24,429
about healing things have a preventive

830
00:30:22,510 --> 00:30:26,200
is about preventing things from

831
00:30:24,429 --> 00:30:28,240
happening and enable is actually the

832
00:30:26,200 --> 00:30:30,220
most important pillars because the way I

833
00:30:28,240 --> 00:30:32,110
look at it security has to be an enabler

834
00:30:30,220 --> 00:30:34,690
for the business everything we do

835
00:30:32,110 --> 00:30:36,820
eventually has to become an enable to

836
00:30:34,690 --> 00:30:38,200
allow either the death views or the Ops

837
00:30:36,820 --> 00:30:40,120
teams or the business things to make

838
00:30:38,200 --> 00:30:42,040
good decisions so that's where we put

839
00:30:40,120 --> 00:30:43,600
all those actors to do that

840
00:30:42,040 --> 00:30:45,070
we have a trust where you know we put

841
00:30:43,600 --> 00:30:48,159
customer trust for girls to put things

842
00:30:45,070 --> 00:30:49,960
like TV PR and my way gdpr doesn't mean

843
00:30:48,160 --> 00:30:52,840
anything to you you really need to take

844
00:30:49,960 --> 00:30:54,580
a look at it because it's going to be a

845
00:30:52,840 --> 00:30:56,379
major change right

846
00:30:54,580 --> 00:30:58,360
and it actually does it is actually a

847
00:30:56,380 --> 00:31:00,400
great way to also map below these things

848
00:30:58,360 --> 00:31:02,080
we have the detect which is all of our

849
00:31:00,400 --> 00:31:05,230
business response in the tech response

850
00:31:02,080 --> 00:31:09,639
so that's kind of our immune system and

851
00:31:05,230 --> 00:31:11,530
finally I dedicate which kind of and the

852
00:31:09,640 --> 00:31:13,480
things everything we do right so waivers

853
00:31:11,530 --> 00:31:15,340
becomes a graph is that we have these

854
00:31:13,480 --> 00:31:18,490
time killers and the villains we've

855
00:31:15,340 --> 00:31:21,399
mapped to capabilities right so so these

856
00:31:18,490 --> 00:31:25,180
are the capabilities and serve

857
00:31:21,400 --> 00:31:27,670
things came up very well and the

858
00:31:25,180 --> 00:31:30,970
capabilities are basically what we want

859
00:31:27,670 --> 00:31:33,220
to build for this Philips right and then

860
00:31:30,970 --> 00:31:35,170
what's interesting is that we also then

861
00:31:33,220 --> 00:31:36,730
have the capability mapped your program

862
00:31:35,170 --> 00:31:38,260
so that means that if you take the

863
00:31:36,730 --> 00:31:40,870
prevention you take the secure Network

864
00:31:38,260 --> 00:31:42,850
we have these programs of stuff that we

865
00:31:40,870 --> 00:31:44,800
do and the programs are mapped to

866
00:31:42,850 --> 00:31:46,929
projects so what you actually have is

867
00:31:44,800 --> 00:31:48,790
you have these really cool kind of world

868
00:31:46,930 --> 00:31:51,070
where you have a pillar collapse key

869
00:31:48,790 --> 00:31:53,409
capability who maps to a program who

870
00:31:51,070 --> 00:31:54,970
master project and then you know he's

871
00:31:53,410 --> 00:31:56,380
approaches right so for example

872
00:31:54,970 --> 00:31:58,570
something we do with the acetone guys

873
00:31:56,380 --> 00:32:01,540
except even here but you want to do some

874
00:31:58,570 --> 00:32:04,090
habit intelligence right we can select

875
00:32:01,540 --> 00:32:05,170
from the drop-down box which pillar you

876
00:32:04,090 --> 00:32:06,939
are which need for building these

877
00:32:05,170 --> 00:32:08,679
programs so you can see that we actually

878
00:32:06,940 --> 00:32:10,570
use JIRA to manage the projects

879
00:32:08,679 --> 00:32:13,420
themselves right and then we create

880
00:32:10,570 --> 00:32:16,450
sensing like this right now it's really

881
00:32:13,420 --> 00:32:17,740
cool about this is that this all comes

882
00:32:16,450 --> 00:32:19,420
from JIRA and you guys see how the

883
00:32:17,740 --> 00:32:21,040
pillars maps and there's the pillars

884
00:32:19,420 --> 00:32:24,309
there's the capabilities there's

885
00:32:21,040 --> 00:32:26,080
programs and then projects right what is

886
00:32:24,309 --> 00:32:27,970
very interesting is that is only one act

887
00:32:26,080 --> 00:32:30,159
where this view that I could actually

888
00:32:27,970 --> 00:32:33,400
understand what the hell we were trying

889
00:32:30,160 --> 00:32:35,590
to do right across the entire security

890
00:32:33,400 --> 00:32:37,330
group right because it's only one you

891
00:32:35,590 --> 00:32:39,639
can kind of visualize data like this

892
00:32:37,330 --> 00:32:42,428
that it becomes consumable like even

893
00:32:39,640 --> 00:32:42,970
this graph if you pick even this table

894
00:32:42,429 --> 00:32:45,000
here

895
00:32:42,970 --> 00:32:46,510
if you cannot normalize it like this

896
00:32:45,000 --> 00:32:48,370
becomes a readable

897
00:32:46,510 --> 00:32:50,350
you can't you have like you know 30

898
00:32:48,370 --> 00:32:52,360
prevent things right and then the

899
00:32:50,350 --> 00:32:54,580
probability to do this in Excel it would

900
00:32:52,360 --> 00:32:55,659
be out of date the moment you do that we

901
00:32:54,580 --> 00:32:57,730
did is we had a virtual easing

902
00:32:55,660 --> 00:33:00,370
compliments it was out of date within

903
00:32:57,730 --> 00:33:02,830
probably like five hours and within

904
00:33:00,370 --> 00:33:05,500
three days was already totally kind of

905
00:33:02,830 --> 00:33:07,059
you know fort so it doesn't work so and

906
00:33:05,500 --> 00:33:08,860
because he gave us a guarantee like this

907
00:33:07,059 --> 00:33:11,260
right so this is another view where

908
00:33:08,860 --> 00:33:13,209
again all the data comes from here but

909
00:33:11,260 --> 00:33:15,309
can you see how I was able to map the

910
00:33:13,210 --> 00:33:17,220
data in the way that I could see my past

911
00:33:15,309 --> 00:33:19,050
with her like a budget thing

912
00:33:17,220 --> 00:33:21,390
tonight ecstatic to be there that wanted

913
00:33:19,050 --> 00:33:24,240
to map this and you even map the risks

914
00:33:21,390 --> 00:33:25,830
that are mapped to that project so this

915
00:33:24,240 --> 00:33:27,420
is how the thing works you get a

916
00:33:25,830 --> 00:33:29,909
vulnerability that we found we map the

917
00:33:27,420 --> 00:33:31,080
risks the risk now map to projects you

918
00:33:29,910 --> 00:33:33,840
have some program capacity the ability

919
00:33:31,080 --> 00:33:35,460
much the pillar right but you didn't see

920
00:33:33,840 --> 00:33:36,780
the whole thing connected the reason why

921
00:33:35,460 --> 00:33:39,210
you do a project is where the project

922
00:33:36,780 --> 00:33:39,750
fixes risks that's why you fund the

923
00:33:39,210 --> 00:33:42,360
project

924
00:33:39,750 --> 00:33:44,100
it's that simple right and then when our

925
00:33:42,360 --> 00:33:46,139
new risk comes along the question is do

926
00:33:44,100 --> 00:33:48,240
we have a nice project to status in or

927
00:33:46,140 --> 00:33:50,640
is not even in a road map which is a

928
00:33:48,240 --> 00:33:52,860
much more boring cover so how do I hear

929
00:33:50,640 --> 00:33:55,500
this is the created you know this is

930
00:33:52,860 --> 00:33:59,010
what you do right so the way my do the

931
00:33:55,500 --> 00:34:00,780
world is I use whatever technology the

932
00:33:59,010 --> 00:34:03,480
company has and for everything else I

933
00:34:00,780 --> 00:34:04,980
use JIRA and confluence and and and

934
00:34:03,480 --> 00:34:06,870
themself at the moment I start to ask

935
00:34:04,980 --> 00:34:10,170
the question - Jared conference where

936
00:34:06,870 --> 00:34:12,029
I'm not unlike one of a bunch in the

937
00:34:10,170 --> 00:34:13,950
world that there's no answer for or

938
00:34:12,030 --> 00:34:15,690
there's no easy solution I write a

939
00:34:13,949 --> 00:34:17,129
script for it right I program it and

940
00:34:15,690 --> 00:34:19,980
that's what you have to do because

941
00:34:17,130 --> 00:34:21,480
there's a time where the tool just

942
00:34:19,980 --> 00:34:25,409
cannot handle like you don't think for

943
00:34:21,480 --> 00:34:27,810
example to to map this is really hard to

944
00:34:25,409 --> 00:34:30,569
do because you are one degree of

945
00:34:27,810 --> 00:34:31,889
separation away alright so you can have

946
00:34:30,570 --> 00:34:33,390
to talk to James you've been trying to

947
00:34:31,889 --> 00:34:34,560
do this with JIRA right I know it's

948
00:34:33,389 --> 00:34:37,529
heavy blow up a couple tears right

949
00:34:34,560 --> 00:34:40,440
because you just can't or if there's a

950
00:34:37,530 --> 00:34:42,120
scale right so the way you're ready to

951
00:34:40,440 --> 00:34:44,760
do this is that this means that I'm

952
00:34:42,120 --> 00:34:48,420
asked to give me over s the maps to this

953
00:34:44,760 --> 00:34:49,770
project I have a particular severity it

954
00:34:48,420 --> 00:34:51,990
doesn't work because you actually have

955
00:34:49,770 --> 00:34:53,670
things mapping into it right and you get

956
00:34:51,989 --> 00:34:55,379
zero money when you go show me the

957
00:34:53,670 --> 00:34:56,820
residual risks and then you can remove

958
00:34:55,380 --> 00:34:58,590
the one higher because I want to go to a

959
00:34:56,820 --> 00:35:00,660
killer and I want to see all the risks

960
00:34:58,590 --> 00:35:02,400
and mapped level because that's what I

961
00:35:00,660 --> 00:35:04,259
report to the board if you think about

962
00:35:02,400 --> 00:35:06,270
it right where the board was to see is

963
00:35:04,260 --> 00:35:08,400
the killers maybe the capabilities right

964
00:35:06,270 --> 00:35:10,560
and you want to know what is the status

965
00:35:08,400 --> 00:35:12,450
of each one of those and it has to be

966
00:35:10,560 --> 00:35:13,710
mapped by reality which basically B is

967
00:35:12,450 --> 00:35:17,279
the amount that needs to be mapped the

968
00:35:13,710 --> 00:35:20,640
project it needs to be mapped to drips

969
00:35:17,280 --> 00:35:21,540
so here you do so these two whatever

970
00:35:20,640 --> 00:35:24,390
back straight

971
00:35:21,540 --> 00:35:26,430
we need to create this right it is open

972
00:35:24,390 --> 00:35:28,799
source and that's get it from era please

973
00:35:26,430 --> 00:35:30,569
contribute right so what this tool does

974
00:35:28,800 --> 00:35:32,700
is pretty cool actually there's two

975
00:35:30,570 --> 00:35:34,950
melons one Modi dumps all the data from

976
00:35:32,700 --> 00:35:36,750
zero into a nice JSON file right and

977
00:35:34,950 --> 00:35:38,220
then do some processing and the other

978
00:35:36,750 --> 00:35:40,380
one is actually consuming JIRA in real

979
00:35:38,220 --> 00:35:42,660
time I haven't got the program actually

980
00:35:40,380 --> 00:35:44,700
updating gear because I want to do a bit

981
00:35:42,660 --> 00:35:46,589
slower because I I do have a fear of of

982
00:35:44,700 --> 00:35:48,089
basically you know fat fingering

983
00:35:46,590 --> 00:35:50,160
aquarium and deleting half of the

984
00:35:48,090 --> 00:35:51,030
friction JIRA stuff right so I'm about

985
00:35:50,160 --> 00:35:53,790
the point where I'm actually doing

986
00:35:51,030 --> 00:35:55,020
updates from the tool oh into JIRA but

987
00:35:53,790 --> 00:35:56,610
that's the me next right

988
00:35:55,020 --> 00:35:57,420
but you just need to create views like

989
00:35:56,610 --> 00:36:00,870
this makes a massive difference

990
00:35:57,420 --> 00:36:02,460
especially this one so again coming to

991
00:36:00,870 --> 00:36:04,170
Brad everybody's the neck to everybody

992
00:36:02,460 --> 00:36:06,390
you click an exit from the Mentos and we

993
00:36:04,170 --> 00:36:08,430
have a steep part part part of this

994
00:36:06,390 --> 00:36:09,000
right so that's that's how everything

995
00:36:08,430 --> 00:36:11,970
that's today

996
00:36:09,000 --> 00:36:13,410
so one of the interesting is that how

997
00:36:11,970 --> 00:36:16,049
they know your team's working right so

998
00:36:13,410 --> 00:36:17,910
one thing is very important is when the

999
00:36:16,050 --> 00:36:20,190
team is actually doing stuff tough like

1000
00:36:17,910 --> 00:36:22,170
well is that you know the note system is

1001
00:36:20,190 --> 00:36:24,600
working when new nodes are being created

1002
00:36:22,170 --> 00:36:27,090
without the main drives being pushing it

1003
00:36:24,600 --> 00:36:28,500
that's really no the systems work that's

1004
00:36:27,090 --> 00:36:29,970
where you know it's scary and you know

1005
00:36:28,500 --> 00:36:31,350
my you know when your team crash this is

1006
00:36:29,970 --> 00:36:33,689
when they blow up the ground and screw

1007
00:36:31,350 --> 00:36:35,700
it because that's part of the evolution

1008
00:36:33,690 --> 00:36:38,010
of it right so one thing that

1009
00:36:35,700 --> 00:36:39,210
interesting is that exact if you don't

1010
00:36:38,010 --> 00:36:41,580
use JIRA how the hell you keep tasks

1011
00:36:39,210 --> 00:36:43,170
right but and so one of the things that

1012
00:36:41,580 --> 00:36:44,670
we do with JIRA or what else like I

1013
00:36:43,170 --> 00:36:46,590
mentioned before you have to capture and

1014
00:36:44,670 --> 00:36:48,600
happening everything right if you don't

1015
00:36:46,590 --> 00:36:51,060
capture it a task you will lose it

1016
00:36:48,600 --> 00:36:53,370
that's why my default is put everything

1017
00:36:51,060 --> 00:36:56,310
in there and then we manage these in

1018
00:36:53,370 --> 00:37:00,180
question is that you need a team of

1019
00:36:56,310 --> 00:37:02,640
humans to manage this right i I think

1020
00:37:00,180 --> 00:37:04,230
the biggest mistake most users do even

1021
00:37:02,640 --> 00:37:07,140
development team is they don't allocate

1022
00:37:04,230 --> 00:37:10,380
enough resources for the maintenance of

1023
00:37:07,140 --> 00:37:14,430
these systems so we basically have and

1024
00:37:10,380 --> 00:37:16,200
to remote superstars right some of you

1025
00:37:14,430 --> 00:37:18,960
guys come at them from salmon under ian

1026
00:37:16,200 --> 00:37:21,330
robert their sole job is to maintain

1027
00:37:18,960 --> 00:37:24,660
JIRA and confluence that's all they do

1028
00:37:21,330 --> 00:37:27,720
that's why we scared right but without

1029
00:37:24,660 --> 00:37:28,460
that if there's a scare and the reality

1030
00:37:27,720 --> 00:37:30,020
is that when you look at the

1031
00:37:28,460 --> 00:37:31,220
cause of the resources compared to

1032
00:37:30,020 --> 00:37:34,070
sometimes you ever had you have on your

1033
00:37:31,220 --> 00:37:36,830
team it's very low but you need to have

1034
00:37:34,070 --> 00:37:39,290
that if you don't have that you actually

1035
00:37:36,830 --> 00:37:41,180
want not right so again what do you do

1036
00:37:39,290 --> 00:37:42,830
and what that means is you have a real

1037
00:37:41,180 --> 00:37:45,200
operation team because they much they

1038
00:37:42,830 --> 00:37:46,730
maintain the graph so do you think about

1039
00:37:45,200 --> 00:37:49,069
graphs or suicide if they have to be

1040
00:37:46,730 --> 00:37:52,640
obtained right that's that's the way

1041
00:37:49,070 --> 00:37:55,430
that's the key message here right and in

1042
00:37:52,640 --> 00:37:55,970
a way that's obviously a key element of

1043
00:37:55,430 --> 00:37:59,180
all this

1044
00:37:55,970 --> 00:38:03,230
so one money thinking about this is that

1045
00:37:59,180 --> 00:38:04,819
you know you should have when you have

1046
00:38:03,230 --> 00:38:06,410
an ops team make sure that you empower

1047
00:38:04,820 --> 00:38:08,030
them to show you give them a budget see

1048
00:38:06,410 --> 00:38:09,618
what the training or curse stuff you

1049
00:38:08,030 --> 00:38:11,150
know I just viewed as a graph right

1050
00:38:09,619 --> 00:38:12,260
again even the budget is just a graph

1051
00:38:11,150 --> 00:38:15,530
right you want to make sure you delegate

1052
00:38:12,260 --> 00:38:18,589
it to the right elements and basically

1053
00:38:15,530 --> 00:38:21,260
how and finally you know just to speed

1054
00:38:18,589 --> 00:38:23,720
up the final part right one of the

1055
00:38:21,260 --> 00:38:25,820
things that was also very important and

1056
00:38:23,720 --> 00:38:28,580
I find myself having a big allergy to

1057
00:38:25,820 --> 00:38:31,369
this these things that break a graph

1058
00:38:28,580 --> 00:38:33,529
right so and this is very important

1059
00:38:31,369 --> 00:38:35,420
because in the same way that sometimes

1060
00:38:33,530 --> 00:38:38,060
is very hard to predict the unintended

1061
00:38:35,420 --> 00:38:40,310
consequences of things I've learned that

1062
00:38:38,060 --> 00:38:42,230
if you create things that break graphs

1063
00:38:40,310 --> 00:38:44,570
you are preventing a lot of future

1064
00:38:42,230 --> 00:38:45,859
events to occur and sometimes the

1065
00:38:44,570 --> 00:38:47,960
immediate events might not be that

1066
00:38:45,859 --> 00:38:49,880
significant but there will be that line

1067
00:38:47,960 --> 00:38:51,890
that continuum that you might come back

1068
00:38:49,880 --> 00:38:53,180
here later going wow this happened

1069
00:38:51,890 --> 00:38:55,098
because of this because of this because

1070
00:38:53,180 --> 00:38:57,290
it is because of this though our summers

1071
00:38:55,099 --> 00:38:59,750
for the ones you guys went occur because

1072
00:38:57,290 --> 00:39:01,820
me first when Sebastian met at the same

1073
00:38:59,750 --> 00:39:03,800
place I made a connection I were able to

1074
00:39:01,820 --> 00:39:05,450
immediately spend you know with that

1075
00:39:03,800 --> 00:39:07,609
graph and make you scared

1076
00:39:05,450 --> 00:39:09,109
right so it's quite powerful that's why

1077
00:39:07,609 --> 00:39:11,630
I like your pants or start because we'd

1078
00:39:09,109 --> 00:39:12,920
stand and this and if you and unbroken

1079
00:39:11,630 --> 00:39:15,750
graphs can actually broke by the

1080
00:39:12,920 --> 00:39:17,910
pressure value so a become for exam

1081
00:39:15,750 --> 00:39:19,470
what about when example the open source

1082
00:39:17,910 --> 00:39:20,848
their engine right so they actually

1083
00:39:19,470 --> 00:39:23,640
visit summer

1084
00:39:20,849 --> 00:39:26,460
now the money situation where maybe not

1085
00:39:23,640 --> 00:39:29,250
that much has happened since but in

1086
00:39:26,460 --> 00:39:30,930
terms of maybe like big developments but

1087
00:39:29,250 --> 00:39:33,330
the the connections that have occurred

1088
00:39:30,930 --> 00:39:34,680
however going to be significant so this

1089
00:39:33,330 --> 00:39:36,270
is the thing if they have nonetheless

1090
00:39:34,680 --> 00:39:38,848
they were haven't broken the ground at

1091
00:39:36,270 --> 00:39:41,250
that moment in time right so but this is

1092
00:39:38,849 --> 00:39:43,859
hard right it took them a bit of little

1093
00:39:41,250 --> 00:39:46,830
convincing an energy right to do it but

1094
00:39:43,859 --> 00:39:48,630
it's I think it makes it much better in

1095
00:39:46,830 --> 00:39:50,910
the medium term right so again you give

1096
00:39:48,630 --> 00:39:52,560
up this guy actually right because we do

1097
00:39:50,910 --> 00:39:53,879
a look at is our what we do most times

1098
00:39:52,560 --> 00:39:55,170
you're actually pushing fast and fast

1099
00:39:53,880 --> 00:39:56,640
and stuff so that means we're pushing

1100
00:39:55,170 --> 00:39:59,070
problems faster and faster to production

1101
00:39:56,640 --> 00:40:00,868
right and and what we need to think of

1102
00:39:59,070 --> 00:40:03,420
you may think of the CIA pipeline as a

1103
00:40:00,869 --> 00:40:06,000
crap just need a week to start writing

1104
00:40:03,420 --> 00:40:09,150
rules for our CI right

1105
00:40:06,000 --> 00:40:12,690
our CI is an application itself right if

1106
00:40:09,150 --> 00:40:17,430
you don't test your your CI a field test

1107
00:40:12,690 --> 00:40:19,859
of CI with with rules and the tests you

1108
00:40:17,430 --> 00:40:21,960
don't have a repeatability right so your

1109
00:40:19,859 --> 00:40:23,310
CI is an application that you need to

1110
00:40:21,960 --> 00:40:25,290
have test unfortunate we don't have a

1111
00:40:23,310 --> 00:40:27,690
bit testy if you guys are environments

1112
00:40:25,290 --> 00:40:29,430
for it but you can create them is you

1113
00:40:27,690 --> 00:40:30,660
can create a DSL for it but this is

1114
00:40:29,430 --> 00:40:32,910
actually something very important or

1115
00:40:30,660 --> 00:40:34,980
else all you're doing is optimizing this

1116
00:40:32,910 --> 00:40:37,109
thing that is actually pushing coding

1117
00:40:34,980 --> 00:40:39,200
systems all the way faster we used to

1118
00:40:37,109 --> 00:40:41,250
have a lot of fragility in this system

1119
00:40:39,200 --> 00:40:43,470
finally visit recruiters here if you

1120
00:40:41,250 --> 00:40:45,510
guys thinking about this he's where look

1121
00:40:43,470 --> 00:40:47,250
at is that you need to find we need to

1122
00:40:45,510 --> 00:40:49,080
meet again team as a graph so whatever

1123
00:40:47,250 --> 00:40:50,880
collapsing for candidates is like you

1124
00:40:49,080 --> 00:40:53,279
have to the blogging contribution

1125
00:40:50,880 --> 00:40:55,950
conference open source collaborations is

1126
00:40:53,280 --> 00:40:58,500
a ground I want to see the graph of the

1127
00:40:55,950 --> 00:41:00,118
candidate right and you can even do each

1128
00:40:58,500 --> 00:41:00,829
new stuff right there's no reason why

1129
00:41:00,119 --> 00:41:02,479
they should be here

1130
00:41:00,829 --> 00:41:04,099
they work for the company this should be

1131
00:41:02,479 --> 00:41:06,348
able to happen penguin ability to

1132
00:41:04,099 --> 00:41:08,630
collaborate right and be involved right

1133
00:41:06,349 --> 00:41:10,700
that's how you get to work for a great

1134
00:41:08,630 --> 00:41:12,170
company right because you should be

1135
00:41:10,700 --> 00:41:13,999
there so he's up is about building that

1136
00:41:12,170 --> 00:41:15,769
black right so the first recruit that

1137
00:41:13,999 --> 00:41:18,019
sends me a graph of a person I guarantee

1138
00:41:15,769 --> 00:41:20,959
you they'll all go back right and

1139
00:41:18,019 --> 00:41:23,629
basically and that's right finally I

1140
00:41:20,959 --> 00:41:25,129
wanna give an idea how you can turn the

1141
00:41:23,630 --> 00:41:27,440
problem into a solution listen tonight

1142
00:41:25,130 --> 00:41:29,809
we working Chizik actually my wife is

1143
00:41:27,440 --> 00:41:31,130
working on this where they trying to fix

1144
00:41:29,809 --> 00:41:33,380
this right this is one of the bridges

1145
00:41:31,130 --> 00:41:35,239
this is the map of cheesy right where I

1146
00:41:33,380 --> 00:41:36,619
live so you can see that doesn't work

1147
00:41:35,239 --> 00:41:39,049
right so the problem is you have the

1148
00:41:36,619 --> 00:41:40,999
square to go to a rectangle doesn't

1149
00:41:39,049 --> 00:41:43,579
 work right the solution was to

1150
00:41:40,999 --> 00:41:45,680
turn this problem into the solution so

1151
00:41:43,579 --> 00:41:48,759
each square represents a time line so

1152
00:41:45,680 --> 00:41:51,859
you've got literally this is like you

1153
00:41:48,759 --> 00:41:54,109
1800 all the way to a tizzy right so

1154
00:41:51,859 --> 00:41:55,940
it's a cool example of using design to

1155
00:41:54,109 --> 00:41:58,190
take a problem and make that part of

1156
00:41:55,940 --> 00:41:59,869
solution right so there's a seventh

1157
00:41:58,190 --> 00:42:01,309
because you know if you want the air to

1158
00:41:59,869 --> 00:42:03,680
miss the trick right we doing another

1159
00:42:01,309 --> 00:42:05,900
one next year he's real outcomes there's

1160
00:42:03,680 --> 00:42:07,910
a great book you might have it the final

1161
00:42:05,900 --> 00:42:10,549
quarter this is that we need to start

1162
00:42:07,910 --> 00:42:12,649
working together because as the

1163
00:42:10,549 --> 00:42:13,969
criminals are hoping involved this is

1164
00:42:12,650 --> 00:42:16,369
gonna get much worse

1165
00:42:13,969 --> 00:42:18,049
right and we really need to start

1166
00:42:16,369 --> 00:42:20,539
collaborating and there's some really

1167
00:42:18,049 --> 00:42:22,579
cool ideas like our CDC which we connect

1168
00:42:20,539 --> 00:42:25,160
defense cluster and also things of

1169
00:42:22,579 --> 00:42:26,660
collaboration providing we as an

1170
00:42:25,160 --> 00:42:28,489
industry need to really start sharing

1171
00:42:26,660 --> 00:42:30,799
and covering a lot more of the ideas

1172
00:42:28,489 --> 00:42:32,209
that we're doing because things are

1173
00:42:30,799 --> 00:42:34,219
gonna get a lot more tricky right and

1174
00:42:32,209 --> 00:42:36,799
and I think there's an interesting move

1175
00:42:34,219 --> 00:42:37,819
of a lot of us who you know interesting

1176
00:42:36,799 --> 00:42:39,380
professionals who were talking to the

1177
00:42:37,819 --> 00:42:40,529
defense side of actually trying to solve

1178
00:42:39,380 --> 00:42:42,240
the problem that we

1179
00:42:40,530 --> 00:42:44,130
leverage that because that's that's

1180
00:42:42,240 --> 00:42:45,870
basic how do we stand

1181
00:42:44,130 --> 00:42:50,550
thank you

1182
00:42:45,870 --> 00:42:50,549
[Applause]
