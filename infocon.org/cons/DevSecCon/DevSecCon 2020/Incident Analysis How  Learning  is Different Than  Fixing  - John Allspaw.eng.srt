1
00:00:00,060 --> 00:00:05,970
hi John hi hello I can hear you now it's

2
00:00:05,970 --> 00:00:09,000
ooh all right so this is John auspi and

3
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:11,160
he's gonna be talking about incident

4
00:00:11,160 --> 00:00:13,889
analysis how learning is different and

5
00:00:13,889 --> 00:00:16,139
fixing and I'm super excited for it so

6
00:00:16,139 --> 00:00:18,810
I'll let you introduce yourself and kick

7
00:00:18,810 --> 00:00:21,570
it off all right thank you

8
00:00:21,570 --> 00:00:24,029
well hello everyone my name is John all

9
00:00:24,029 --> 00:00:27,660
spa I've spent most of my career trying

10
00:00:27,660 --> 00:00:29,640
to understand how engineers solve

11
00:00:29,640 --> 00:00:33,510
problems whether or not I can help with

12
00:00:33,510 --> 00:00:35,610
it or it's a different story

13
00:00:35,610 --> 00:00:37,440
I don't have much time in this talks I

14
00:00:37,440 --> 00:00:39,719
don't want to spend too much talking

15
00:00:39,719 --> 00:00:45,030
about myself so here's the the main gist

16
00:00:45,030 --> 00:00:47,879
the high-level points that I want to get

17
00:00:47,879 --> 00:00:53,550
across the first is I'm going to assert

18
00:00:53,550 --> 00:00:55,680
that current and typical sort of

19
00:00:55,680 --> 00:00:57,360
conventional approaches to learning from

20
00:00:57,360 --> 00:00:59,969
incidents have very little to do with

21
00:00:59,969 --> 00:01:05,670
actual learning from the title you can

22
00:01:05,670 --> 00:01:08,340
understand that my opinion is that that

23
00:01:08,340 --> 00:01:10,710
learning is not the same as fixing and

24
00:01:10,710 --> 00:01:12,090
it we'll talk a little bit about that

25
00:01:12,090 --> 00:01:16,380
and what I mean by them and also assert

26
00:01:16,380 --> 00:01:18,720
that most post incident review documents

27
00:01:18,720 --> 00:01:21,170
are documents that are written to be

28
00:01:21,170 --> 00:01:25,759
more often filed not written to be read

29
00:01:25,759 --> 00:01:29,670
that has maybe some obvious or not so

30
00:01:29,670 --> 00:01:31,740
obvious implications on what's learned

31
00:01:31,740 --> 00:01:35,040
from them I would also say that that

32
00:01:35,040 --> 00:01:37,020
changing the primary focus from fixing

33
00:01:37,020 --> 00:01:39,869
to learning will result in a significant

34
00:01:39,869 --> 00:01:42,540
competitive advantage now it's going to

35
00:01:42,540 --> 00:01:47,130
be quite difficult to sort of make a

36
00:01:47,130 --> 00:01:50,460
switch but let's see what I mean by

37
00:01:50,460 --> 00:01:52,470
fixing and learning and see see what you

38
00:01:52,470 --> 00:01:52,890
think

39
00:01:52,890 --> 00:01:55,939
we can talk about it later in Q&A so

40
00:01:55,939 --> 00:01:59,759
when as engineers are you know we're

41
00:01:59,759 --> 00:02:02,509
somewhat hardwired to some extent our

42
00:02:02,509 --> 00:02:06,659
core rationale for being is to fix

43
00:02:06,659 --> 00:02:08,580
things is to build things is to adjust

44
00:02:08,580 --> 00:02:11,520
things of that sort of thing I'm gonna

45
00:02:11,520 --> 00:02:13,500
say that when you focus on

46
00:02:13,500 --> 00:02:15,180
seeing things they tend to get fixed

47
00:02:15,180 --> 00:02:19,770
pretty quickly and and that is sort of

48
00:02:19,770 --> 00:02:22,260
expected right but I would also say this

49
00:02:22,260 --> 00:02:25,170
is that the quality and effectiveness of

50
00:02:25,170 --> 00:02:29,130
this fixing and otherwise preventing

51
00:02:29,130 --> 00:02:30,959
future issues is going to be

52
00:02:30,959 --> 00:02:33,420
proportional or certainly influenced on

53
00:02:33,420 --> 00:02:35,490
how well you understand how the thing

54
00:02:35,490 --> 00:02:38,610
works to begin with and this is a real

55
00:02:38,610 --> 00:02:42,390
this is a real distinction again the

56
00:02:42,390 --> 00:02:44,100
point I will keep sort of trying to

57
00:02:44,100 --> 00:02:46,400
hammer home is if your goal is to fix

58
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:49,770
you're gonna fix something whether or

59
00:02:49,770 --> 00:02:51,570
not it was the right thing to fix or

60
00:02:51,570 --> 00:02:56,100
fixing it in the way that that is it

61
00:02:56,100 --> 00:02:58,830
possible even if you were to take a step

62
00:02:58,830 --> 00:03:01,200
back a little bit to get a broader

63
00:03:01,200 --> 00:03:05,160
understanding is really up in the air

64
00:03:05,160 --> 00:03:06,959
another way of saying this is that

65
00:03:06,959 --> 00:03:10,050
attention paid to learning will always

66
00:03:10,050 --> 00:03:13,890
yield higher quality fixing that is that

67
00:03:13,890 --> 00:03:17,459
I'm feel very confident about if instead

68
00:03:17,459 --> 00:03:19,230
on the flip side you focus exclusively

69
00:03:19,230 --> 00:03:23,010
on fixing that can be a barrier for

70
00:03:23,010 --> 00:03:26,430
learning because you're you have you as

71
00:03:26,430 --> 00:03:29,870
soon as you have presented a plausible

72
00:03:29,870 --> 00:03:34,680
way to to fix something then it tends to

73
00:03:34,680 --> 00:03:37,739
shut down under the under sort of time

74
00:03:37,739 --> 00:03:39,690
and production pressure shut down any

75
00:03:39,690 --> 00:03:43,079
other options so I wanted to take a look

76
00:03:43,079 --> 00:03:44,910
at sort of the conventional view on

77
00:03:44,910 --> 00:03:47,850
where post-incident analysis how it

78
00:03:47,850 --> 00:03:49,799
usually goes it you know there's an

79
00:03:49,799 --> 00:03:52,680
incident and our sometime happens maybe

80
00:03:52,680 --> 00:03:54,690
somebody will do some work to make a

81
00:03:54,690 --> 00:03:58,170
timeline this is usually at least

82
00:03:58,170 --> 00:03:59,790
typically conventionally where the

83
00:03:59,790 --> 00:04:03,060
industry believes the work happens which

84
00:04:03,060 --> 00:04:04,860
is this meeting by the way it's a very

85
00:04:04,860 --> 00:04:07,140
expensive meeting the burden on this

86
00:04:07,140 --> 00:04:09,420
meeting to sort of solve all of the

87
00:04:09,420 --> 00:04:11,760
problems so that it never happens again

88
00:04:11,760 --> 00:04:16,858
is very very large maybe somebody will

89
00:04:16,858 --> 00:04:18,269
write a report hopefully somebody will

90
00:04:18,269 --> 00:04:19,589
write something up because there are

91
00:04:19,589 --> 00:04:21,690
people who will be in positions where

92
00:04:21,690 --> 00:04:24,080
they weren't there at the

93
00:04:24,080 --> 00:04:27,229
and they weren't at the meeting but the

94
00:04:27,229 --> 00:04:29,240
were the tendency to think that they're

95
00:04:29,240 --> 00:04:31,340
only our greatest value is here on these

96
00:04:31,340 --> 00:04:35,330
these action items now if the action

97
00:04:35,330 --> 00:04:38,479
lands are the only goal you've got then

98
00:04:38,479 --> 00:04:41,930
I would throw out go out on a limb and

99
00:04:41,930 --> 00:04:44,439
say that you're missing out on a

100
00:04:44,439 --> 00:04:47,900
significant amount of what you could be

101
00:04:47,900 --> 00:04:51,800
getting out of the incident so learning

102
00:04:51,800 --> 00:04:53,539
let's talk about learning for just a

103
00:04:53,539 --> 00:04:56,240
minute here I would say that learning is

104
00:04:56,240 --> 00:04:59,090
happening all of the time it's a core

105
00:04:59,090 --> 00:05:02,590
part of being human not just engineers

106
00:05:02,590 --> 00:05:05,060
the thing that I would say is there is

107
00:05:05,060 --> 00:05:07,969
no there's no world distinctions no

108
00:05:07,969 --> 00:05:09,919
crisp line up there's that people are

109
00:05:09,919 --> 00:05:11,960
not learning all we're not learning from

110
00:05:11,960 --> 00:05:13,969
incidents or we're learning for this is

111
00:05:13,969 --> 00:05:16,009
the fact is that learning is happening

112
00:05:16,009 --> 00:05:17,900
the question isn't whether learning is

113
00:05:17,900 --> 00:05:19,789
happening it is the question there's

114
00:05:19,789 --> 00:05:22,610
what is learned who is learning Leonard

115
00:05:22,610 --> 00:05:24,289
nerd a learning Howard and how they

116
00:05:24,289 --> 00:05:26,689
learn all of these depend on how well

117
00:05:26,689 --> 00:05:28,580
practices are set up to support it if

118
00:05:28,580 --> 00:05:32,900
there are conditions set up by peers and

119
00:05:32,900 --> 00:05:35,870
technology and leadership and all sorts

120
00:05:35,870 --> 00:05:37,520
of the sort of the business support that

121
00:05:37,520 --> 00:05:39,349
makes it a priority to learn from

122
00:05:39,349 --> 00:05:42,919
incidents but then then it's possible if

123
00:05:42,919 --> 00:05:49,069
it's not then it's not this might be

124
00:05:49,069 --> 00:05:52,610
reasonably obvious but I think it's

125
00:05:52,610 --> 00:05:55,669
definitely in the modern complex

126
00:05:55,669 --> 00:05:58,729
software applications no one can

127
00:05:58,729 --> 00:06:00,620
understand everything about everything

128
00:06:00,620 --> 00:06:05,330
no single person can do this we should

129
00:06:05,330 --> 00:06:08,330
be surprised given this that things work

130
00:06:08,330 --> 00:06:11,060
as the as well as they do you think

131
00:06:11,060 --> 00:06:14,180
about this for just a moment no one has

132
00:06:14,180 --> 00:06:16,639
an objectively comprehensive

133
00:06:16,639 --> 00:06:20,360
understanding of how everything is

134
00:06:20,360 --> 00:06:21,460
supposed to work

135
00:06:21,460 --> 00:06:27,159
they collectively with their peers

136
00:06:27,159 --> 00:06:30,229
recalibrate how they understand things

137
00:06:30,229 --> 00:06:32,569
work incidents are a big part of that

138
00:06:32,569 --> 00:06:35,190
and it's still

139
00:06:35,190 --> 00:06:38,130
comprehensive the fact is that they know

140
00:06:38,130 --> 00:06:41,100
enough about it to make it work as well

141
00:06:41,100 --> 00:06:45,510
as it does finally I would just throw

142
00:06:45,510 --> 00:06:47,820
here that the frequency of incidents has

143
00:06:47,820 --> 00:06:49,740
really nothing to do with how well an

144
00:06:49,740 --> 00:06:52,770
organization learns right it might be a

145
00:06:52,770 --> 00:06:56,130
signal of something but if the number of

146
00:06:56,130 --> 00:06:58,530
incidents the rate of incidents is going

147
00:06:58,530 --> 00:07:00,720
up that is not evidence that the

148
00:07:00,720 --> 00:07:04,200
organization is not learning if it's

149
00:07:04,200 --> 00:07:08,700
going down that is not evidence that the

150
00:07:08,700 --> 00:07:12,990
organization is learning a conventional

151
00:07:12,990 --> 00:07:15,780
myth is that we have an incident and

152
00:07:15,780 --> 00:07:18,030
we'll think of it as and this canonical

153
00:07:18,030 --> 00:07:19,710
set of lessons can then sort of

154
00:07:19,710 --> 00:07:22,260
extracted like a concentrated write from

155
00:07:22,260 --> 00:07:23,550
this incident that's the whole point

156
00:07:23,550 --> 00:07:26,100
right which is then sort of shared or

157
00:07:26,100 --> 00:07:30,590
sort of sort of transmitted to a group

158
00:07:30,590 --> 00:07:34,530
when we have this idea which is we've

159
00:07:34,530 --> 00:07:37,020
here's this incident here they are these

160
00:07:37,020 --> 00:07:39,360
beautiful delicious lessons they're

161
00:07:39,360 --> 00:07:42,090
concentrated so you know be careful now

162
00:07:42,090 --> 00:07:47,510
consume them this when we have this

163
00:07:47,510 --> 00:07:50,130
perspective the perceived problem to be

164
00:07:50,130 --> 00:07:51,630
solved then is how to somehow share

165
00:07:51,630 --> 00:07:53,370
better it must not be because of the

166
00:07:53,370 --> 00:07:56,280
lessons but because of the sharing now

167
00:07:56,280 --> 00:07:57,660
on say that sharing is a little bit

168
00:07:57,660 --> 00:08:00,270
funky here right because in in some

169
00:08:00,270 --> 00:08:02,669
contexts if I were to share something

170
00:08:02,669 --> 00:08:05,130
with you and you did take it or didn't

171
00:08:05,130 --> 00:08:07,230
even know it was there did I share it

172
00:08:07,230 --> 00:08:09,030
really or did really I just make it

173
00:08:09,030 --> 00:08:10,910
available to you

174
00:08:10,910 --> 00:08:13,770
that's a digression the reality is that

175
00:08:13,770 --> 00:08:15,720
different people will always have

176
00:08:15,720 --> 00:08:17,400
bearing understandings they have

177
00:08:17,400 --> 00:08:19,110
different perspective before and after

178
00:08:19,110 --> 00:08:22,410
an incident and what questions or

179
00:08:22,410 --> 00:08:24,150
mysteries remain for them can't be

180
00:08:24,150 --> 00:08:27,030
captured in some sort of one size that's

181
00:08:27,030 --> 00:08:30,660
all that that goes to sort of the masses

182
00:08:30,660 --> 00:08:32,940
if I tell you something that you already

183
00:08:32,940 --> 00:08:35,820
knew did you learn it did you learn it

184
00:08:35,820 --> 00:08:38,219
from that lesson I'm not entirely sure

185
00:08:38,219 --> 00:08:41,969
that's true what is important or notable

186
00:08:41,969 --> 00:08:43,979
or interesting - somebody will differ

187
00:08:43,979 --> 00:08:47,370
from person to person and can also be

188
00:08:47,370 --> 00:08:49,080
valuable to each

189
00:08:49,080 --> 00:08:51,810
those people you can know something that

190
00:08:51,810 --> 00:08:55,080
your peers knew and you still learned

191
00:08:55,080 --> 00:08:59,190
that this turns out what's important or

192
00:08:59,190 --> 00:09:01,200
notable or interesting is what they ask

193
00:09:01,200 --> 00:09:03,990
what actually remembered now this might

194
00:09:03,990 --> 00:09:06,210
be somewhat controversial I'm going to

195
00:09:06,210 --> 00:09:07,470
say this that if you can't remember

196
00:09:07,470 --> 00:09:08,760
something you can't say that you've

197
00:09:08,760 --> 00:09:09,420
learned it

198
00:09:09,420 --> 00:09:12,150
I'm feeling very strongly about this

199
00:09:12,150 --> 00:09:19,290
since my kids have been home learning if

200
00:09:19,290 --> 00:09:22,590
I asked you and we do my organization

201
00:09:22,590 --> 00:09:26,520
when we talk to organ teams we talk to

202
00:09:26,520 --> 00:09:28,020
engineers we always ask them about

203
00:09:28,020 --> 00:09:30,510
incidents we ask them we say can you

204
00:09:30,510 --> 00:09:32,540
tell us about an incident that was

205
00:09:32,540 --> 00:09:34,680
significant tell us a story about an

206
00:09:34,680 --> 00:09:37,830
incident well the first thing to come to

207
00:09:37,830 --> 00:09:41,610
mind is I think in the hundreds of times

208
00:09:41,610 --> 00:09:43,200
we've asked that there's not one

209
00:09:43,200 --> 00:09:45,150
engineer who has failed to come up with

210
00:09:45,150 --> 00:09:49,310
a story and here's the thing they're

211
00:09:49,310 --> 00:09:50,660
amazing

212
00:09:50,660 --> 00:09:58,140
not one story did I ever think that's ok

213
00:09:58,140 --> 00:10:01,650
that's fine they were all amazing when

214
00:10:01,650 --> 00:10:04,230
we asked people about incidents couple

215
00:10:04,230 --> 00:10:07,560
things are common one is they've become

216
00:10:07,560 --> 00:10:09,480
very animated when they tell the story

217
00:10:09,480 --> 00:10:11,460
oh yeah listen to this let me tell you

218
00:10:11,460 --> 00:10:13,020
here's this one I can tell you about

219
00:10:13,020 --> 00:10:14,250
this one story yeah let's tell you about

220
00:10:14,250 --> 00:10:17,910
this one story they also tend to include

221
00:10:17,910 --> 00:10:20,490
some sort of elements of suspense and

222
00:10:20,490 --> 00:10:23,130
how they say it right even engineers

223
00:10:23,130 --> 00:10:26,340
they wouldn't describe themselves as

224
00:10:26,340 --> 00:10:28,890
storytellers absolutely put a lot of

225
00:10:28,890 --> 00:10:31,920
effort whether they know it or not into

226
00:10:31,920 --> 00:10:34,170
how they tell it that's what makes for

227
00:10:34,170 --> 00:10:35,630
the story

228
00:10:35,630 --> 00:10:38,670
they include elements of surprise like

229
00:10:38,670 --> 00:10:41,460
for example what we didn't know so so we

230
00:10:41,460 --> 00:10:47,310
went to you know fire up memcache but we

231
00:10:47,310 --> 00:10:51,150
didn't know at the time was there also

232
00:10:51,150 --> 00:10:52,440
some sort of give us some sort of

233
00:10:52,440 --> 00:10:55,290
backstory right so so while this was

234
00:10:55,290 --> 00:10:58,170
going on remember we were streaming the

235
00:10:58,170 --> 00:10:59,610
Super Bowl and this is what was

236
00:10:59,610 --> 00:11:01,860
happening or remember we were

237
00:11:01,860 --> 00:11:04,230
you know we were two hours away from our

238
00:11:04,230 --> 00:11:06,120
company IP owing this is what was

239
00:11:06,120 --> 00:11:10,410
happening they recall it most amazingly

240
00:11:10,410 --> 00:11:14,250
in ridiculous really fine detail even if

241
00:11:14,250 --> 00:11:17,070
it's many years since and all of this

242
00:11:17,070 --> 00:11:20,130
fits with what we know about learning

243
00:11:20,130 --> 00:11:21,680
from incidents from other domains

244
00:11:21,680 --> 00:11:24,630
stories that people remember have

245
00:11:24,630 --> 00:11:26,520
elements of challenge struggle and

246
00:11:26,520 --> 00:11:29,130
difficulty so therefore if you want to

247
00:11:29,130 --> 00:11:33,420
broaden and deepen the the understanding

248
00:11:33,420 --> 00:11:37,980
of how things work that surround an

249
00:11:37,980 --> 00:11:40,470
incident in your organization you should

250
00:11:40,470 --> 00:11:44,850
consider doing that one way of saying

251
00:11:44,850 --> 00:11:46,590
this is that interesting incident

252
00:11:46,590 --> 00:11:49,800
analysis documents let's set aside the

253
00:11:49,800 --> 00:11:52,760
meeting interesting documents get read

254
00:11:52,760 --> 00:11:55,800
compelling incidents get read and they

255
00:11:55,800 --> 00:11:57,930
get shared with others you know you're

256
00:11:57,930 --> 00:11:59,400
on the right track when engineers say

257
00:11:59,400 --> 00:12:03,600
listen to their colleague you've got to

258
00:12:03,600 --> 00:12:05,370
you got to read this I don't care what

259
00:12:05,370 --> 00:12:07,320
you're doing just if you're not

260
00:12:07,320 --> 00:12:10,470
deploying to Prague just just and when

261
00:12:10,470 --> 00:12:11,910
you're done deploying it's five you got

262
00:12:11,910 --> 00:12:13,290
to read this gotta read this check this

263
00:12:13,290 --> 00:12:17,700
out fascinating documents get read they

264
00:12:17,700 --> 00:12:19,770
get shared with others commented on and

265
00:12:19,770 --> 00:12:22,170
asked about they get referenced in code

266
00:12:22,170 --> 00:12:24,690
comments and in pull requests you'll see

267
00:12:24,690 --> 00:12:27,080
them referencing architecture diagrams

268
00:12:27,080 --> 00:12:30,260
in other incidents will refer to them

269
00:12:30,260 --> 00:12:33,270
we've seen it we've seen compelling

270
00:12:33,270 --> 00:12:36,120
write-ups so demonstrative so

271
00:12:36,120 --> 00:12:39,450
illustrative of what's happening in the

272
00:12:39,450 --> 00:12:41,520
in the software in the end in the

273
00:12:41,520 --> 00:12:45,240
organization is in that it's been

274
00:12:45,240 --> 00:12:48,300
included in new hire onboarding here's

275
00:12:48,300 --> 00:12:50,310
what's important is that interest

276
00:12:50,310 --> 00:12:55,040
uninteresting documents don't any of it

277
00:12:55,040 --> 00:12:58,800
some of you may have seen or heard of a

278
00:12:58,800 --> 00:13:00,900
movie called green lantern the point I

279
00:13:00,900 --> 00:13:03,300
want to make here is that just because

280
00:13:03,300 --> 00:13:07,430
something's made available to open and

281
00:13:07,430 --> 00:13:10,140
everywhere doesn't mean it's any good

282
00:13:10,140 --> 00:13:12,450
the reason why nobody went to go see

283
00:13:12,450 --> 00:13:15,770
Green Lantern is cuz it's terrible

284
00:13:15,770 --> 00:13:20,130
incident write-ups are the same so

285
00:13:20,130 --> 00:13:22,230
making efforts to highlight the messy

286
00:13:22,230 --> 00:13:24,150
details the messy details are what makes

287
00:13:24,150 --> 00:13:27,030
people wants to read want to ask more

288
00:13:27,030 --> 00:13:29,220
questions what was difficult for people

289
00:13:29,220 --> 00:13:31,530
to understand during the incident what

290
00:13:31,530 --> 00:13:33,210
was surprising for people about the

291
00:13:33,210 --> 00:13:33,870
incident

292
00:13:33,870 --> 00:13:36,270
how do people understand the origins of

293
00:13:36,270 --> 00:13:38,130
the incident what mysteries still remain

294
00:13:38,130 --> 00:13:42,030
for people there are mysteries that

295
00:13:42,030 --> 00:13:44,910
always remain nobody has a comprehensive

296
00:13:44,910 --> 00:13:48,590
objectively true universally understood

297
00:13:48,590 --> 00:13:52,470
understanding of how an incident came to

298
00:13:52,470 --> 00:13:55,740
be and how it took place and what to do

299
00:13:55,740 --> 00:14:00,690
about it later I want to know what was

300
00:14:00,690 --> 00:14:03,030
difficult about an incident and I want

301
00:14:03,030 --> 00:14:05,330
to be able to ask questions about that

302
00:14:05,330 --> 00:14:08,690
this is something that all engineers

303
00:14:08,690 --> 00:14:14,580
could consider internalizing one point

304
00:14:14,580 --> 00:14:16,800
that I'd like to throw out which is

305
00:14:16,800 --> 00:14:19,230
because it's quite typical is that you

306
00:14:19,230 --> 00:14:22,920
only pay attention or pay deliberate

307
00:14:22,920 --> 00:14:25,800
effort to understand the incidents that

308
00:14:25,800 --> 00:14:27,810
have high severity or high customer

309
00:14:27,810 --> 00:14:30,150
impact but here's the thing customer

310
00:14:30,150 --> 00:14:32,100
impact is not equivalent to the

311
00:14:32,100 --> 00:14:34,380
difficulty of solving the issue they're

312
00:14:34,380 --> 00:14:38,130
orthogonal second point is that multiple

313
00:14:38,130 --> 00:14:39,600
difficulties can exist in the same

314
00:14:39,600 --> 00:14:42,990
incident and field and questions about

315
00:14:42,990 --> 00:14:45,540
was about what was or is still is

316
00:14:45,540 --> 00:14:50,100
difficult is that's the gold that is the

317
00:14:50,100 --> 00:14:54,120
critical in that is how lasting memories

318
00:14:54,120 --> 00:14:56,370
are formed and that is how people who

319
00:14:56,370 --> 00:15:00,890
weren't there and were at a meeting all

320
00:15:00,890 --> 00:15:05,430
sort of maintained throughout throughout

321
00:15:05,430 --> 00:15:09,870
time so multiple people have multiple

322
00:15:09,870 --> 00:15:11,700
stories we talk a lot about mental

323
00:15:11,700 --> 00:15:13,170
models but mental models are really

324
00:15:13,170 --> 00:15:15,120
stories they're not pictures they have

325
00:15:15,120 --> 00:15:19,290
there's a an understanding and people

326
00:15:19,290 --> 00:15:22,500
can quite often feel as though until an

327
00:15:22,500 --> 00:15:24,750
incident happens be pretty confident in

328
00:15:24,750 --> 00:15:28,230
there how it works is how how I think it

329
00:15:28,230 --> 00:15:29,280
works is how it works

330
00:15:29,280 --> 00:15:33,520
what incidents do is allow us to take

331
00:15:33,520 --> 00:15:38,860
what we have in our mind and superimpose

332
00:15:38,860 --> 00:15:41,080
it and come sort of contrast with others

333
00:15:41,080 --> 00:15:43,870
and a great deal of it overlaps with

334
00:15:43,870 --> 00:15:46,120
what other people think about how it

335
00:15:46,120 --> 00:15:49,750
works it has to overlap otherwise it

336
00:15:49,750 --> 00:15:51,820
wouldn't work to begin with but when we

337
00:15:51,820 --> 00:15:54,220
can contrast this and what we can do is

338
00:15:54,220 --> 00:15:57,160
use incidents to allow wait a minute so

339
00:15:57,160 --> 00:15:59,440
I I thought it was like this but it

340
00:15:59,440 --> 00:16:01,120
didn't it looked like there's this other

341
00:16:01,120 --> 00:16:04,240
little thing that I missed or orderly

342
00:16:04,240 --> 00:16:06,640
these things that I knew but my

343
00:16:06,640 --> 00:16:08,980
colleagues didn't know this and I

344
00:16:08,980 --> 00:16:11,350
thought they knew and because I thought

345
00:16:11,350 --> 00:16:13,360
they knew I never meant it never

346
00:16:13,360 --> 00:16:15,760
occurred to me to say what I know about

347
00:16:15,760 --> 00:16:17,760
this thing

348
00:16:17,760 --> 00:16:21,070
this is using this opportunity for

349
00:16:21,070 --> 00:16:25,420
actual learning so what are some fine

350
00:16:25,420 --> 00:16:28,840
goals for a post-incident meeting when

351
00:16:28,840 --> 00:16:31,420
participants in a group meeting this big

352
00:16:31,420 --> 00:16:33,400
expensive meeting when they leave the

353
00:16:33,400 --> 00:16:35,620
meeting knowing new things they didn't

354
00:16:35,620 --> 00:16:38,950
know when they entered and new things

355
00:16:38,950 --> 00:16:40,390
they didn't know about what their

356
00:16:40,390 --> 00:16:43,950
colleagues know about the incident

357
00:16:43,950 --> 00:16:49,060
things are going well ideally they'll

358
00:16:49,060 --> 00:16:50,970
also have an understanding of how to

359
00:16:50,970 --> 00:16:53,080
continue discussions and where to

360
00:16:53,080 --> 00:16:55,030
capture it if you think about it for a

361
00:16:55,030 --> 00:16:57,520
minute if the default is you've got an

362
00:16:57,520 --> 00:17:02,050
hour or two hours or some common regular

363
00:17:02,050 --> 00:17:04,720
cadence for how post mortem or post

364
00:17:04,720 --> 00:17:06,400
incident or after-action or learning

365
00:17:06,400 --> 00:17:07,599
review whatever you would like to call

366
00:17:07,599 --> 00:17:12,359
them what these meetings are that seems

367
00:17:12,359 --> 00:17:15,520
strange to spend the same amount of time

368
00:17:15,520 --> 00:17:18,849
in every incident despite the fact that

369
00:17:18,849 --> 00:17:21,280
the incidents can vary in so many

370
00:17:21,280 --> 00:17:24,609
different directions so continuing

371
00:17:24,609 --> 00:17:27,790
discussions and where it's all captured

372
00:17:27,790 --> 00:17:30,790
is significantly important the same

373
00:17:30,790 --> 00:17:35,290
thing happens for write-up when you're

374
00:17:35,290 --> 00:17:38,050
done reading a write-up if you know

375
00:17:38,050 --> 00:17:40,450
things now that you didn't know when you

376
00:17:40,450 --> 00:17:41,730
started

377
00:17:41,730 --> 00:17:44,100
and you know things that you didn't know

378
00:17:44,100 --> 00:17:47,580
about what your colleagues know and how

379
00:17:47,580 --> 00:17:49,320
to continue discussions and where to

380
00:17:49,320 --> 00:17:51,179
capture this is what makes and post

381
00:17:51,179 --> 00:17:53,010
incident review write up something worth

382
00:17:53,010 --> 00:17:53,760
reading

383
00:17:53,760 --> 00:17:55,649
now something worth sharing and

384
00:17:55,649 --> 00:17:57,779
something that could be valuable to

385
00:17:57,779 --> 00:17:59,309
people in the future because you're not

386
00:17:59,309 --> 00:18:02,610
writing it for now you're writing it for

387
00:18:02,610 --> 00:18:05,100
people who will want to read it and need

388
00:18:05,100 --> 00:18:08,730
to read it in the future so here are

389
00:18:08,730 --> 00:18:13,950
some things to experiment with separate

390
00:18:13,950 --> 00:18:15,750
the generation of follow-up action items

391
00:18:15,750 --> 00:18:19,080
from a group meeting right instead of

392
00:18:19,080 --> 00:18:21,149
having the whole goal of that meeting

393
00:18:21,149 --> 00:18:24,179
where people are rushing to get

394
00:18:24,179 --> 00:18:26,909
follow-up items separate it make that

395
00:18:26,909 --> 00:18:30,870
meeting about understanding record in

396
00:18:30,870 --> 00:18:32,309
the document who responded to the

397
00:18:32,309 --> 00:18:33,899
incident and who attended the group

398
00:18:33,899 --> 00:18:36,950
meeting this is supporting your reader

399
00:18:36,950 --> 00:18:39,419
capture things that were done after the

400
00:18:39,419 --> 00:18:41,490
incident but before the group meeting in

401
00:18:41,490 --> 00:18:45,450
the document give write-ups to brand-new

402
00:18:45,450 --> 00:18:47,669
engineers and ask them to record any and

403
00:18:47,669 --> 00:18:50,429
all questions after they've after having

404
00:18:50,429 --> 00:18:54,690
read it link this is an easy one link

405
00:18:54,690 --> 00:18:57,090
jargon terms to documents that describe

406
00:18:57,090 --> 00:19:00,630
them in the incident review document ask

407
00:19:00,630 --> 00:19:03,360
more people to talk diagrams visual

408
00:19:03,360 --> 00:19:06,029
representation can be really important

409
00:19:06,029 --> 00:19:08,760
and make it easier for people to read

410
00:19:08,760 --> 00:19:13,500
and understand have someone who is not

411
00:19:13,500 --> 00:19:14,850
involved in the event

412
00:19:14,850 --> 00:19:19,289
lead the analysis Brian kitchens wrote

413
00:19:19,289 --> 00:19:22,320
this for the blog post that I've linked

414
00:19:22,320 --> 00:19:24,179
to here he says this if the incident

415
00:19:24,179 --> 00:19:25,830
analyst participated in the incident

416
00:19:25,830 --> 00:19:28,139
they will inevitably have a deeper

417
00:19:28,139 --> 00:19:30,000
understanding and bias towards the

418
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:31,889
incident that will be impossible to

419
00:19:31,889 --> 00:19:34,320
remove in the process of analysis if you

420
00:19:34,320 --> 00:19:37,799
were there you're not necessarily going

421
00:19:37,799 --> 00:19:40,019
to investigate things that you are

422
00:19:40,019 --> 00:19:43,399
pretty sure you already know

423
00:19:44,659 --> 00:19:47,669
lastly resist focusing on reducing the

424
00:19:47,669 --> 00:19:51,240
number of incidents Ryan continues on he

425
00:19:51,240 --> 00:19:52,769
says the cliche idea that we would do

426
00:19:52,769 --> 00:19:54,210
this work to reduce the number of

427
00:19:54,210 --> 00:19:55,200
incidents or to

428
00:19:55,200 --> 00:19:56,850
lessen the time to remediate is too

429
00:19:56,850 --> 00:19:59,610
simplistic of course organizations want

430
00:19:59,610 --> 00:20:01,169
to have fewer incidents however stating

431
00:20:01,169 --> 00:20:02,909
this as an integral actually hurts our

432
00:20:02,909 --> 00:20:05,460
organization's indeed it will lead to a

433
00:20:05,460 --> 00:20:07,440
reduction in incident count not from

434
00:20:07,440 --> 00:20:08,760
actually reducing the number of

435
00:20:08,760 --> 00:20:11,789
incidents but rather lessening how and

436
00:20:11,789 --> 00:20:14,850
how often they are reported I would add

437
00:20:14,850 --> 00:20:17,240
to what Ryan says here and say instead

438
00:20:17,240 --> 00:20:19,889
focus on increasing the number of people

439
00:20:19,889 --> 00:20:23,340
who want to read these reports and

440
00:20:23,340 --> 00:20:25,830
attend this post incident review

441
00:20:25,830 --> 00:20:28,950
meetings so that's the talk that I've

442
00:20:28,950 --> 00:20:33,360
got I hope people have questions I'm not

443
00:20:33,360 --> 00:20:36,019
entirely sure if they do but that's the

444
00:20:36,019 --> 00:20:44,309
that is the talk as it stands all right

445
00:20:44,309 --> 00:20:46,260
I'm gonna come off mute I was not

446
00:20:46,260 --> 00:20:51,450
expecting this so um let me see I don't

447
00:20:51,450 --> 00:20:53,570
think there's any questions in the

448
00:20:53,570 --> 00:20:56,010
channels right now so if anybody has

449
00:20:56,010 --> 00:20:59,700
comes right now please share them this

450
00:20:59,700 --> 00:21:04,500
would be a good time um I'm gonna ask my

451
00:21:04,500 --> 00:21:05,909
own questions right now

452
00:21:05,909 --> 00:21:10,289
so one is so I know you've been talking

453
00:21:10,289 --> 00:21:13,710
about this for a while now right now but

454
00:21:13,710 --> 00:21:17,730
I I still see a lot of people handling

455
00:21:17,730 --> 00:21:20,399
incidents and in ways they're opposite

456
00:21:20,399 --> 00:21:26,639
of sort of the ideal way yeah it seems

457
00:21:26,639 --> 00:21:29,880
that no matter how much we talk about it

458
00:21:29,880 --> 00:21:32,460
it kind of doesn't trickle down so is

459
00:21:32,460 --> 00:21:36,149
there something we can do that is a good

460
00:21:36,149 --> 00:21:40,639
question I will be the first to say that

461
00:21:40,639 --> 00:21:43,289
that I would certainly it would be more

462
00:21:43,289 --> 00:21:45,659
satisfying to have seen progress in the

463
00:21:45,659 --> 00:21:50,309
in the industry I would say a couple

464
00:21:50,309 --> 00:21:56,029
things one is my guess is more

465
00:21:56,029 --> 00:21:59,309
organizations have much more leeway than

466
00:21:59,309 --> 00:22:04,860
they think they have in some cases how a

467
00:22:04,860 --> 00:22:08,820
there's nothing that that says that

468
00:22:08,820 --> 00:22:11,130
at least nothing that I've that I've

469
00:22:11,130 --> 00:22:16,740
seen you you know sort of has a

470
00:22:16,740 --> 00:22:18,810
procedure for how to run a post-mortem

471
00:22:18,810 --> 00:22:21,350
meeting on a minute-by-minute basis

472
00:22:21,350 --> 00:22:23,760
there are still as much as I'd like to

473
00:22:23,760 --> 00:22:29,850
rail on on constraining post-mortem

474
00:22:29,850 --> 00:22:32,600
templates to fill out

475
00:22:32,600 --> 00:22:37,110
most of them many of them have you open

476
00:22:37,110 --> 00:22:41,370
text fields right the here's the thing

477
00:22:41,370 --> 00:22:43,860
stories like I've described are

478
00:22:43,860 --> 00:22:47,720
happening they're just not seen as

479
00:22:47,720 --> 00:22:50,520
nothing right there's an official

480
00:22:50,520 --> 00:22:53,430
bookkeeping sort of accounting and you

481
00:22:53,430 --> 00:22:56,340
you know you fill up the form you do the

482
00:22:56,340 --> 00:22:59,070
thing you say don't you say why you know

483
00:22:59,070 --> 00:23:02,970
a certain number of times root cause and

484
00:23:02,970 --> 00:23:07,530
all of that I can say that I'm certainly

485
00:23:07,530 --> 00:23:10,470
not a fan of sort of declaring

486
00:23:10,470 --> 00:23:12,420
organization-wide that something new is

487
00:23:12,420 --> 00:23:15,300
different and and and you're flipping

488
00:23:15,300 --> 00:23:18,330
from some world to another world what we

489
00:23:18,330 --> 00:23:22,200
see more often is enthusiastic

490
00:23:22,200 --> 00:23:24,270
individuals inside the organization

491
00:23:24,270 --> 00:23:26,520
doing things just a little bit

492
00:23:26,520 --> 00:23:27,930
differently in addition to what they're

493
00:23:27,930 --> 00:23:33,630
already doing over time people will be

494
00:23:33,630 --> 00:23:38,370
engaging with that extra stuff moreso

495
00:23:38,370 --> 00:23:40,800
than the stuff that they had been

496
00:23:40,800 --> 00:23:42,900
previously doing because what they're

497
00:23:42,900 --> 00:23:46,080
previously been doing is terrible and

498
00:23:46,080 --> 00:23:49,080
and and you just have to you just have

499
00:23:49,080 --> 00:23:52,730
to give someone a post incident review

500
00:23:52,730 --> 00:23:55,830
you know I ask people all the time we

501
00:23:55,830 --> 00:23:57,900
say well do you have Jim post mortems

502
00:23:57,900 --> 00:24:01,110
and they say they say oh yes so you know

503
00:24:01,110 --> 00:24:03,420
of course we know you never won a good

504
00:24:03,420 --> 00:24:05,520
crisis go to waste and sort of insert

505
00:24:05,520 --> 00:24:08,550
some cliche there and then I say well I

506
00:24:08,550 --> 00:24:10,350
said oh that's excellent I say well who

507
00:24:10,350 --> 00:24:12,960
reads them and nobody has an answer for

508
00:24:12,960 --> 00:24:16,980
that but I can tell you that I well you

509
00:24:16,980 --> 00:24:19,200
know what we hear is that nobody reason

510
00:24:19,200 --> 00:24:20,490
because they're not there's nothing you

511
00:24:20,490 --> 00:24:22,170
can't get much out of it it's easier to

512
00:24:22,170 --> 00:24:22,559
go to your

513
00:24:22,559 --> 00:24:24,470
colleague and say what happened

514
00:24:24,470 --> 00:24:27,870
interesting I'm so another question is

515
00:24:27,870 --> 00:24:30,269
how do you convince upper management not

516
00:24:30,269 --> 00:24:33,149
to reduce number of incidents oh you

517
00:24:33,149 --> 00:24:36,870
probably can't I mean you probably can't

518
00:24:36,870 --> 00:24:37,799
that's what I'm saying

519
00:24:37,799 --> 00:24:42,059
a summary when we know someone we know

520
00:24:42,059 --> 00:24:44,850
quite well has done such a very good job

521
00:24:44,850 --> 00:24:47,519
of continuing to provide the reports the

522
00:24:47,519 --> 00:24:51,889
charts the graphs that management has

523
00:24:51,889 --> 00:24:54,720
continually asked for but what she's

524
00:24:54,720 --> 00:24:59,700
done is to add alongside it the deeper

525
00:24:59,700 --> 00:25:02,340
narrative of what is of what was

526
00:25:02,340 --> 00:25:03,899
important and what was difficult what

527
00:25:03,899 --> 00:25:08,490
was what was notable about a given

528
00:25:08,490 --> 00:25:11,369
incident and over time that they started

529
00:25:11,369 --> 00:25:13,379
looking more at that extra stuff asking

530
00:25:13,379 --> 00:25:15,389
questions more about that and less about

531
00:25:15,389 --> 00:25:19,139
you know is that why isn't that you know

532
00:25:19,139 --> 00:25:23,100
why the number going down and in that

533
00:25:23,100 --> 00:25:24,600
way I'd say it's a little bit of

534
00:25:24,600 --> 00:25:28,799
subterfuge a little bit of you know it's

535
00:25:28,799 --> 00:25:31,259
a little sneaky but it's it's it's

536
00:25:31,259 --> 00:25:36,029
effective another question is um do you

537
00:25:36,029 --> 00:25:38,190
have any recommendations for improving

538
00:25:38,190 --> 00:25:40,980
the quality of storytelling right so any

539
00:25:40,980 --> 00:25:43,649
reference has to read or something to

540
00:25:43,649 --> 00:25:53,039
learn from I mean so so yes here

541
00:25:53,039 --> 00:25:57,080
incidents are really are palpable events

542
00:25:57,080 --> 00:26:04,470
Engineers don't drop their you know

543
00:26:04,470 --> 00:26:06,389
their memories they don't drop their

544
00:26:06,389 --> 00:26:10,289
experiences of having been in the

545
00:26:10,289 --> 00:26:12,869
incident trying to work out what's

546
00:26:12,869 --> 00:26:15,360
happening what does it mean what can we

547
00:26:15,360 --> 00:26:16,399
do

548
00:26:16,399 --> 00:26:19,740
asking engineers who were there about

549
00:26:19,740 --> 00:26:22,080
what was difficult ask them ask them

550
00:26:22,080 --> 00:26:25,110
what what what was what stood out for

551
00:26:25,110 --> 00:26:31,190
them record that stick it in the in the

552
00:26:31,190 --> 00:26:34,799
we've never found an engineer who is shy

553
00:26:34,799 --> 00:26:36,120
about tell

554
00:26:36,120 --> 00:26:38,880
yes about what was hard and what was

555
00:26:38,880 --> 00:26:41,160
difficult the question isn't about

556
00:26:41,160 --> 00:26:42,840
whether or not you can persuade somebody

557
00:26:42,840 --> 00:26:44,370
to give more detail Oh

558
00:26:44,370 --> 00:26:46,620
although that is and if you can set up

559
00:26:46,620 --> 00:26:49,050
it is a challenge to do that if you can

560
00:26:49,050 --> 00:26:53,280
set up a situation where they're giving

561
00:26:53,280 --> 00:26:57,330
details about what it was like for them

562
00:26:57,330 --> 00:27:02,850
and that and that you can you can

563
00:27:02,850 --> 00:27:06,780
demonstrate that you are going to to

564
00:27:06,780 --> 00:27:11,010
keep those details in confidence you may

565
00:27:11,010 --> 00:27:15,690
ask them if you could if not perhaps

566
00:27:15,690 --> 00:27:18,110
quote them but certain paraphrase

567
00:27:18,110 --> 00:27:22,490
unattributed in an incident review but

568
00:27:22,490 --> 00:27:26,870
the the the content generators are there

569
00:27:26,870 --> 00:27:29,250
and and you know that they're there

570
00:27:29,250 --> 00:27:30,810
because these are the stories that you

571
00:27:30,810 --> 00:27:32,670
hear after work these the stories that

572
00:27:32,670 --> 00:27:33,930
you hear during lunch these are the

573
00:27:33,930 --> 00:27:35,970
stories that you hear over drinks these

574
00:27:35,970 --> 00:27:37,170
are the stories that you hear in the

575
00:27:37,170 --> 00:27:45,990
hallways of conferences and yes so when

576
00:27:45,990 --> 00:27:49,400
we find engineers telling stories about

577
00:27:49,400 --> 00:27:52,650
interesting outages every engineer in

578
00:27:52,650 --> 00:27:55,500
the room is quiet and wants to listen

579
00:27:55,500 --> 00:27:59,250
very carefully so that I believe the

580
00:27:59,250 --> 00:28:02,970
powers there I'm another question how do

581
00:28:02,970 --> 00:28:05,700
you encourage or introduce incident

582
00:28:05,700 --> 00:28:07,770
review meetings or a new team I'm a

583
00:28:07,770 --> 00:28:10,050
tester so it's hard to influence or of

584
00:28:10,050 --> 00:28:14,030
course I'm but they're really helpful

585
00:28:14,030 --> 00:28:17,910
you mean having I'm assuming that going

586
00:28:17,910 --> 00:28:19,800
from the world where they're either

587
00:28:19,800 --> 00:28:21,480
having that where they're not having a

588
00:28:21,480 --> 00:28:22,980
meeting can trying to convince them to

589
00:28:22,980 --> 00:28:25,230
have the meeting I'm a sermons note area

590
00:28:25,230 --> 00:28:29,420
yeah and I mean that's a great question

591
00:28:29,420 --> 00:28:36,300
if asking questions you don't have to

592
00:28:36,300 --> 00:28:38,370
have a meeting to ask questions and if

593
00:28:38,370 --> 00:28:46,560
you have if you have some if you don't

594
00:28:46,560 --> 00:28:48,570
have some way of gathering data from

595
00:28:48,570 --> 00:28:50,130
people

596
00:28:50,130 --> 00:28:52,730
qualitative sort of you know just

597
00:28:52,730 --> 00:28:56,490
reflections on what was hard what was

598
00:28:56,490 --> 00:29:00,660
surprising that sort of thing then you

599
00:29:00,660 --> 00:29:02,490
know if there's not a meaning you can't

600
00:29:02,490 --> 00:29:04,740
convince somebody to have meeting you

601
00:29:04,740 --> 00:29:05,970
might be able to convince somebody to

602
00:29:05,970 --> 00:29:08,010
talk to you for five or five or ten

603
00:29:08,010 --> 00:29:12,179
minutes at a time once you what we have

604
00:29:12,179 --> 00:29:15,570
seen is somebody doing that and then

605
00:29:15,570 --> 00:29:17,700
sort of synthesizing what they've heard

606
00:29:17,700 --> 00:29:20,789
into sort of the document at which point

607
00:29:20,789 --> 00:29:23,730
later people you can use that as well

608
00:29:23,730 --> 00:29:26,700
you know we could you know we could have

609
00:29:26,700 --> 00:29:28,830
a meeting we could you know just and we

610
00:29:28,830 --> 00:29:30,960
could experiment with it worst case is

611
00:29:30,960 --> 00:29:33,270
it's a terrible meeting but I'm sure we

612
00:29:33,270 --> 00:29:34,770
already have terrible meetings and we

613
00:29:34,770 --> 00:29:36,990
can't get rid of them so how about just

614
00:29:36,990 --> 00:29:40,500
adding trying one more and trying to

615
00:29:40,500 --> 00:29:44,309
make it a good meeting so I um I will

616
00:29:44,309 --> 00:29:45,870
sort of summarize I think a couple of

617
00:29:45,870 --> 00:29:47,250
questions because I have the same

618
00:29:47,250 --> 00:29:49,049
question is there like a framework for

619
00:29:49,049 --> 00:29:51,900
gathering this data right because um

620
00:29:51,900 --> 00:29:54,240
like there's good questions to ask and

621
00:29:54,240 --> 00:29:55,950
bad questions to ask very Jessica's

622
00:29:55,950 --> 00:29:57,600
gonna be telling you I would not to ask

623
00:29:57,600 --> 00:30:00,990
like one yes you know so um if I'm new

624
00:30:00,990 --> 00:30:02,730
to base I'm approaching this I would

625
00:30:02,730 --> 00:30:04,770
like to know how to even structure this

626
00:30:04,770 --> 00:30:07,530
data gathering point yeah I mean again

627
00:30:07,530 --> 00:30:10,200
if you were to go and I'll put the

628
00:30:10,200 --> 00:30:11,580
slides out there and there are a number

629
00:30:11,580 --> 00:30:14,280
of talks that that I've given that I

630
00:30:14,280 --> 00:30:16,559
could sort of include links the

631
00:30:16,559 --> 00:30:19,350
questions you ask are very important

632
00:30:19,350 --> 00:30:25,110
they are they are primary primary way

633
00:30:25,110 --> 00:30:28,520
that you can get you know really

634
00:30:28,520 --> 00:30:31,590
critical and important information and

635
00:30:31,590 --> 00:30:33,480
you certainly can do it poorly what I

636
00:30:33,480 --> 00:30:40,830
would say is there's there if you if you

637
00:30:40,830 --> 00:30:44,130
Center your questions on what was

638
00:30:44,130 --> 00:30:47,970
difficult what was straightforward what

639
00:30:47,970 --> 00:30:50,490
was surprising and what still sticks out

640
00:30:50,490 --> 00:30:53,669
for them as mysterious you can't really

641
00:30:53,669 --> 00:30:55,850
go wrong

642
00:30:56,070 --> 00:30:58,320
you'll hear you will hear more the

643
00:30:58,320 --> 00:31:01,320
better answer is watch Jessica's talk

644
00:31:01,320 --> 00:31:03,240
that's the kind of answer

645
00:31:03,240 --> 00:31:04,260
all right

646
00:31:04,260 --> 00:31:07,890
we really slightly vary on it same so um

647
00:31:07,890 --> 00:31:10,140
thank you so much for the awesome talk

648
00:31:10,140 --> 00:31:13,110
and I know people can't find you online

649
00:31:13,110 --> 00:31:15,030
and probably can find us slides online

650
00:31:15,030 --> 00:31:16,770
so thank you John

651
00:31:16,770 --> 00:31:20,960
Thank You Sasha thank you and thanks
