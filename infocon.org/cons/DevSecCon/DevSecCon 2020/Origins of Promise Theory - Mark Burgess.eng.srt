1
00:01:25,420 --> 00:01:28,090
but involved in setting up the networks

2
00:01:28,090 --> 00:01:31,930
at the time the early 1990s the ethernet

3
00:01:31,930 --> 00:01:34,960
was just becoming deployed and Sun

4
00:01:34,960 --> 00:01:37,360
Microsystems workstations were

5
00:01:37,360 --> 00:01:40,570
everywhere in specially in physics and I

6
00:01:40,570 --> 00:01:42,490
got interested in setting up this

7
00:01:42,490 --> 00:01:44,380
network and understanding how it worked

8
00:01:44,380 --> 00:01:47,350
and for me as a physicist it was

9
00:01:47,350 --> 00:01:49,479
interesting to to learn everything about

10
00:01:49,479 --> 00:01:52,900
how these computers worked and overtime

11
00:01:52,900 --> 00:01:55,479
get my hands dirty making little changes

12
00:01:55,479 --> 00:01:58,330
installing them changing them and

13
00:01:58,330 --> 00:01:59,880
understanding them

14
00:01:59,880 --> 00:02:02,410
but over time I decided I wanted to

15
00:02:02,410 --> 00:02:04,690
understand them as a natural phenomenon

16
00:02:04,690 --> 00:02:06,550
much as you would understand physics

17
00:02:06,550 --> 00:02:09,250
instead of figuring out how to program

18
00:02:09,250 --> 00:02:15,790
them I'm sorry we had a problem with you

19
00:02:15,790 --> 00:02:18,160
oh I was starting to the streaming now

20
00:02:18,160 --> 00:02:22,170
again all again sorry

21
00:02:24,209 --> 00:02:26,890
good morning everyone from around the

22
00:02:26,890 --> 00:02:29,350
world it's my honor to be able to open

23
00:02:29,350 --> 00:02:32,049
all the talks for Patrick this morning

24
00:02:32,049 --> 00:02:35,080
and wishing you all the best in these

25
00:02:35,080 --> 00:02:37,420
strange times my name is Mark Burgess

26
00:02:37,420 --> 00:02:41,680
and I probably best known for writing

27
00:02:41,680 --> 00:02:43,780
the open source tool way back in the

28
00:02:43,780 --> 00:02:45,670
beginning of open source known as

29
00:02:45,670 --> 00:02:46,410
cfengine

30
00:02:46,410 --> 00:02:50,200
and out of that story came something

31
00:02:50,200 --> 00:02:52,810
called promise theory which event he

32
00:02:52,810 --> 00:02:55,390
also became associated with cfengine I

33
00:02:55,390 --> 00:02:56,590
want to talk a little bit about the

34
00:02:56,590 --> 00:02:59,230
origins of that to you today because

35
00:02:59,230 --> 00:03:00,640
it's a story that's a little bit

36
00:03:00,640 --> 00:03:03,010
misunderstood let me tell you a bit

37
00:03:03,010 --> 00:03:04,690
about myself for those of you who don't

38
00:03:04,690 --> 00:03:08,260
know me I was trained as a physicist I

39
00:03:08,260 --> 00:03:11,620
went to university to do a doctorate in

40
00:03:11,620 --> 00:03:14,440
theoretical physics and when I finished

41
00:03:14,440 --> 00:03:18,070
I moved to Norway as a postdoc and I got

42
00:03:18,070 --> 00:03:20,470
interested in computers I was never in

43
00:03:20,470 --> 00:03:22,120
that interested in computers when I was

44
00:03:22,120 --> 00:03:25,060
younger unlike perhaps some of you my

45
00:03:25,060 --> 00:03:26,709
first computer program was a drum

46
00:03:26,709 --> 00:03:29,019
machine and then I got interested in

47
00:03:29,019 --> 00:03:32,320
6502 assembler adventure games I was

48
00:03:32,320 --> 00:03:34,930
never a gamer but I liked adventure

49
00:03:34,930 --> 00:03:37,060
games because I was interested in the

50
00:03:37,060 --> 00:03:38,830
understanding of language

51
00:03:38,830 --> 00:03:40,720
and machine intelligence and stories

52
00:03:40,720 --> 00:03:44,700
like that now when I went to Norway to

53
00:03:44,700 --> 00:03:47,890
become a postdoc in physics I got

54
00:03:47,890 --> 00:03:50,350
involved in setting up the networks at

55
00:03:50,350 --> 00:03:53,890
the time the early 1990s the ethernet

56
00:03:53,890 --> 00:03:56,890
was just becoming deployed and Sun

57
00:03:56,890 --> 00:03:59,350
Microsystems workstations were

58
00:03:59,350 --> 00:04:02,500
everywhere especially in physics and I

59
00:04:02,500 --> 00:04:04,390
got interested in setting up this

60
00:04:04,390 --> 00:04:06,520
network and understanding how I worked

61
00:04:06,520 --> 00:04:09,370
and for me as a physicist it was

62
00:04:09,370 --> 00:04:11,620
interesting to to learn everything about

63
00:04:11,620 --> 00:04:14,890
how these computers worked and over time

64
00:04:14,890 --> 00:04:17,470
get my hands dirty making little changes

65
00:04:17,470 --> 00:04:20,290
installing them changing them and

66
00:04:20,290 --> 00:04:21,750
understanding them

67
00:04:21,750 --> 00:04:24,280
but over time I decided I wanted to

68
00:04:24,280 --> 00:04:26,650
understand them as a natural phenomenon

69
00:04:26,650 --> 00:04:28,510
much as you would understand physics

70
00:04:28,510 --> 00:04:31,390
instead of figuring out how to program

71
00:04:31,390 --> 00:04:33,070
them and assuming they would do what we

72
00:04:33,070 --> 00:04:36,010
what we want them to because we all know

73
00:04:36,010 --> 00:04:38,830
that computers only do what we want them

74
00:04:38,830 --> 00:04:42,310
to some of the time rather I wanted to

75
00:04:42,310 --> 00:04:44,200
kind of observe them like animals in the

76
00:04:44,200 --> 00:04:48,160
wild see how they behaved understand if

77
00:04:48,160 --> 00:04:49,960
there were any natural phenomena

78
00:04:49,960 --> 00:04:51,910
associated with networks of computers

79
00:04:51,910 --> 00:04:54,460
and and get to grips with that problem

80
00:04:54,460 --> 00:04:57,790
so I started to automate the

81
00:04:57,790 --> 00:04:59,830
configuration and maintenance of these

82
00:04:59,830 --> 00:05:02,530
systems that sounds like a strange idea

83
00:05:02,530 --> 00:05:04,870
to maintain computer systems it wasn't

84
00:05:04,870 --> 00:05:07,750
an idea that people at the time it was

85
00:05:07,750 --> 00:05:09,040
pretty much assumed that you would

86
00:05:09,040 --> 00:05:11,830
install a computer and then it was done

87
00:05:11,830 --> 00:05:14,650
was finished everything would work you

88
00:05:14,650 --> 00:05:16,660
would do your programming your writing

89
00:05:16,660 --> 00:05:19,630
whatever it was and on you would go but

90
00:05:19,630 --> 00:05:22,180
as a physicist I knew that systems

91
00:05:22,180 --> 00:05:25,030
degrade over time and they become

92
00:05:25,030 --> 00:05:27,660
engaged in all kinds of interactions and

93
00:05:27,660 --> 00:05:31,570
come under load under pressure and they

94
00:05:31,570 --> 00:05:33,190
behave differently when they communicate

95
00:05:33,190 --> 00:05:37,540
with one another so I I really got

96
00:05:37,540 --> 00:05:39,280
interested in this idea of collecting

97
00:05:39,280 --> 00:05:42,700
data to study the system's the origins

98
00:05:42,700 --> 00:05:45,430
of cfengine came out of that 1993 I

99
00:05:45,430 --> 00:05:47,740
started programming the first version I

100
00:05:47,740 --> 00:05:50,440
decided to give it away as an open

101
00:05:50,440 --> 00:05:52,600
source canoe project

102
00:05:52,600 --> 00:05:56,020
it was adopted by CERN I gave some talks

103
00:05:56,020 --> 00:05:59,260
there and the new project really helped

104
00:05:59,260 --> 00:06:01,180
me to disseminate this around the world

105
00:06:01,180 --> 00:06:04,320
and many people started to use this I

106
00:06:04,320 --> 00:06:08,260
went to America in 1997 to share this at

107
00:06:08,260 --> 00:06:11,890
the U Sonic's Lisa conference and that

108
00:06:11,890 --> 00:06:14,050
was the first time I really tried to

109
00:06:14,050 --> 00:06:17,380
explain my thinking to manage the

110
00:06:17,380 --> 00:06:20,020
systems by making changes and

111
00:06:20,020 --> 00:06:22,060
corrections for example garbage

112
00:06:22,060 --> 00:06:25,690
collection or configuration of software

113
00:06:25,690 --> 00:06:28,210
now back in the beginning of Unix

114
00:06:28,210 --> 00:06:29,650
there were many different kinds of

115
00:06:29,650 --> 00:06:32,110
workstations there was the AIX Apollo

116
00:06:32,110 --> 00:06:39,430
hp-ux ultrix many others these unix

117
00:06:39,430 --> 00:06:41,470
versions were quite unlike the linux

118
00:06:41,470 --> 00:06:43,270
that we that dominates the scene today

119
00:06:43,270 --> 00:06:45,490
they were all very different from one

120
00:06:45,490 --> 00:06:47,800
another even the bourne shell was very

121
00:06:47,800 --> 00:06:50,260
different on each system sometimes it

122
00:06:50,260 --> 00:06:51,820
was being a sage sometimes it was the

123
00:06:51,820 --> 00:06:55,210
zed shell i think that was AI X and so

124
00:06:55,210 --> 00:06:57,190
you couldn't write one script would work

125
00:06:57,190 --> 00:06:59,350
everywhere the layouts of the systems

126
00:06:59,350 --> 00:07:00,610
were different everything was very very

127
00:07:00,610 --> 00:07:02,650
different so I realized you'd need a

128
00:07:02,650 --> 00:07:04,930
layer of abstraction on top of that to

129
00:07:04,930 --> 00:07:07,870
make those differences go away and this

130
00:07:07,870 --> 00:07:09,760
immediately introduced the notion of

131
00:07:09,760 --> 00:07:11,980
virtualization which is of course now

132
00:07:11,980 --> 00:07:15,670
very well understood thing but we needed

133
00:07:15,670 --> 00:07:18,010
to virtualize the concept of a machine

134
00:07:18,010 --> 00:07:20,860
create a model around it and then this

135
00:07:20,860 --> 00:07:23,650
notion of desired end state came about

136
00:07:23,650 --> 00:07:26,830
where we have some idea of how we want

137
00:07:26,830 --> 00:07:28,540
the system's to behave how they want

138
00:07:28,540 --> 00:07:29,910
them to be configured

139
00:07:29,910 --> 00:07:32,220
instead of making a lot of changes

140
00:07:32,220 --> 00:07:35,740
manually we would simply try to define

141
00:07:35,740 --> 00:07:37,390
the desired end State and make the

142
00:07:37,390 --> 00:07:40,000
Machine homed in on that state a bit

143
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:42,910
like driving with the GPS so the desired

144
00:07:42,910 --> 00:07:44,980
end state becomes your final destination

145
00:07:44,980 --> 00:07:47,050
and the Machine figures out how to get

146
00:07:47,050 --> 00:07:49,950
there this was in contrast to the

147
00:07:49,950 --> 00:07:52,780
preferred idea which was called

148
00:07:52,780 --> 00:07:56,290
congruence where you start the system in

149
00:07:56,290 --> 00:07:59,350
a unknown State a blank state a fresh

150
00:07:59,350 --> 00:08:01,840
installation and then you make a number

151
00:08:01,840 --> 00:08:04,210
of changes one after the other to try to

152
00:08:04,210 --> 00:08:06,350
bring it to the desired State

153
00:08:06,350 --> 00:08:09,050
the problem with that was that it's

154
00:08:09,050 --> 00:08:11,750
fragile to the smallest intervention and

155
00:08:11,750 --> 00:08:14,020
the smallest miscalculation and

156
00:08:14,020 --> 00:08:16,070
environmental influences often make it

157
00:08:16,070 --> 00:08:18,140
go wrong so you don't necessarily end up

158
00:08:18,140 --> 00:08:20,120
where you thought you would when I went

159
00:08:20,120 --> 00:08:22,730
to America to explain this nobody really

160
00:08:22,730 --> 00:08:24,610
understood where I was talking about and

161
00:08:24,610 --> 00:08:27,950
I got a bit depressed and on my way home

162
00:08:27,950 --> 00:08:31,340
I got on the plane and I started to

163
00:08:31,340 --> 00:08:33,650
think about it the idea of immune immune

164
00:08:33,650 --> 00:08:37,280
systems making us well after sickness

165
00:08:37,280 --> 00:08:39,799
and could I use that as an idea to

166
00:08:39,799 --> 00:08:42,140
explain this notion of desired end state

167
00:08:42,140 --> 00:08:44,990
computing so I went back the year

168
00:08:44,990 --> 00:08:47,390
afterwards and gave a talk which was

169
00:08:47,390 --> 00:08:52,840
computer immunology 1998 and this talk

170
00:08:52,840 --> 00:08:57,670
described a lot of the ideas of scale

171
00:08:57,670 --> 00:09:01,210
maintaining repairing a system over time

172
00:09:01,210 --> 00:09:04,070
from the single machine to networks of

173
00:09:04,070 --> 00:09:07,160
machines eventually imagined a day where

174
00:09:07,160 --> 00:09:09,350
there was so many machines that we could

175
00:09:09,350 --> 00:09:12,530
just scratch a few skin cells away as we

176
00:09:12,530 --> 00:09:15,740
do in our bodies and it wouldn't matter

177
00:09:15,740 --> 00:09:17,690
the system would be resilient to that

178
00:09:17,690 --> 00:09:20,150
change so we could lose a few systems

179
00:09:20,150 --> 00:09:22,550
and it would still carry on working back

180
00:09:22,550 --> 00:09:25,790
then 1998 this was a pipe dream today of

181
00:09:25,790 --> 00:09:28,520
course with the cloud this is the normal

182
00:09:28,520 --> 00:09:31,130
practice today we have this idea just

183
00:09:31,130 --> 00:09:33,440
show me the code just make it happen

184
00:09:33,440 --> 00:09:36,170
and we kind of reject the idea that we

185
00:09:36,170 --> 00:09:37,760
can we need to understand something

186
00:09:37,760 --> 00:09:40,010
deeply if we can make things happen if

187
00:09:40,010 --> 00:09:42,200
we can pull the strings to make a

188
00:09:42,200 --> 00:09:45,320
computer dance fine then we control it

189
00:09:45,320 --> 00:09:48,080
of course this is quite wrong but I

190
00:09:48,080 --> 00:09:49,870
wanted to get to the bottom of this

191
00:09:49,870 --> 00:09:51,920
problem and I started to study

192
00:09:51,920 --> 00:09:54,110
everything that I could as time went by

193
00:09:54,110 --> 00:09:56,900
I decided we needed data so to

194
00:09:56,900 --> 00:09:58,580
understand computers we needed to

195
00:09:58,580 --> 00:10:01,400
measure them I built into cfengine this

196
00:10:01,400 --> 00:10:03,890
capability of unsupervised machine

197
00:10:03,890 --> 00:10:06,470
learning a very simple way of collecting

198
00:10:06,470 --> 00:10:09,830
data and building it up over time I know

199
00:10:09,830 --> 00:10:12,260
and even though the original analyses

200
00:10:12,260 --> 00:10:14,360
were manual it could eventually automate

201
00:10:14,360 --> 00:10:16,790
some of that as well and turned it into

202
00:10:16,790 --> 00:10:19,430
a self-regulating

203
00:10:19,430 --> 00:10:22,850
almost the live machine living system

204
00:10:22,850 --> 00:10:25,580
this was my dream at the time to create

205
00:10:25,580 --> 00:10:29,750
a completely autonomous system of local

206
00:10:29,750 --> 00:10:33,080
agents that could learn and adapt over

207
00:10:33,080 --> 00:10:36,170
time but still maintain this desired end

208
00:10:36,170 --> 00:10:38,870
state policy most of the metrics that

209
00:10:38,870 --> 00:10:40,580
were able to measure about systems have

210
00:10:40,580 --> 00:10:42,290
almost nothing to do with the behavior

211
00:10:42,290 --> 00:10:45,080
of the system over time certainly not in

212
00:10:45,080 --> 00:10:46,970
a way that can be used to adapt or make

213
00:10:46,970 --> 00:10:50,420
changes and even today we measure almost

214
00:10:50,420 --> 00:10:53,360
nothing useful about the systems that we

215
00:10:53,360 --> 00:10:57,649
we use but around 2000 I was in America

216
00:10:57,649 --> 00:11:00,440
and was actually given an award the

217
00:11:00,440 --> 00:11:03,140
Sejal lifetime achievement award for

218
00:11:03,140 --> 00:11:07,070
contributions to area of systems and I

219
00:11:07,070 --> 00:11:08,720
felt a bit guilty because I didn't feel

220
00:11:08,720 --> 00:11:10,279
as though I understood these systems

221
00:11:10,279 --> 00:11:14,029
very well at all and I wanted to go back

222
00:11:14,029 --> 00:11:16,339
in and understand more for me a

223
00:11:16,339 --> 00:11:18,680
watershed moment happened when I started

224
00:11:18,680 --> 00:11:20,450
to work with some colleagues from

225
00:11:20,450 --> 00:11:22,880
Telenor here in Norway another physics

226
00:11:22,880 --> 00:11:25,100
friend of mine Geoffrey can write and

227
00:11:25,100 --> 00:11:27,860
his colleague Katanga Monson got

228
00:11:27,860 --> 00:11:29,990
interested in graph theory and we

229
00:11:29,990 --> 00:11:31,459
actually worked for a little bit on

230
00:11:31,459 --> 00:11:34,880
search algorithms like google's pagerank

231
00:11:34,880 --> 00:11:37,510
using notions like Network centrality

232
00:11:37,510 --> 00:11:40,279
from this I got a love of graph theory

233
00:11:40,279 --> 00:11:42,110
and understood how networks could be

234
00:11:42,110 --> 00:11:45,110
described and how different parts of a

235
00:11:45,110 --> 00:11:46,880
network play a different role in

236
00:11:46,880 --> 00:11:50,450
understanding the outcomes of a

237
00:11:50,450 --> 00:11:52,730
cooperation a key point here is how

238
00:11:52,730 --> 00:11:54,650
influencer gets transmitted through

239
00:11:54,650 --> 00:11:57,310
networks and I wanted to build this into

240
00:11:57,310 --> 00:12:00,230
management systems but didn't fully

241
00:12:00,230 --> 00:12:03,260
understand the mechanics of it so I went

242
00:12:03,260 --> 00:12:04,730
to the drawing board and I tried to

243
00:12:04,730 --> 00:12:06,610
really get to grips with the theory of

244
00:12:06,610 --> 00:12:09,800
cooperation and it's a surprisingly

245
00:12:09,800 --> 00:12:12,290
difficult thing to do because we imagine

246
00:12:12,290 --> 00:12:14,209
this is something that's been studied at

247
00:12:14,209 --> 00:12:16,250
length but in fact it hasn't there are

248
00:12:16,250 --> 00:12:18,829
theories like game theory this queueing

249
00:12:18,829 --> 00:12:22,550
theory there is the Axelrod's theory of

250
00:12:22,550 --> 00:12:24,709
the evolution of cooperation all of

251
00:12:24,709 --> 00:12:25,730
these things I spent a long time

252
00:12:25,730 --> 00:12:29,620
studying including the bioinformatics of

253
00:12:29,620 --> 00:12:32,690
DNA analysis thinking that perhaps

254
00:12:32,690 --> 00:12:35,570
somehow this might relate to the

255
00:12:35,570 --> 00:12:37,760
error-correction aspects of machines and

256
00:12:37,760 --> 00:12:40,160
so on eventually I came up with a simple

257
00:12:40,160 --> 00:12:42,380
understanding of what was missing and

258
00:12:42,380 --> 00:12:44,870
that was this notion of intent you know

259
00:12:44,870 --> 00:12:45,680
as a physicist

260
00:12:45,680 --> 00:12:48,040
we're very obsessed with measurable

261
00:12:48,040 --> 00:12:50,870
numerical quantitative results but

262
00:12:50,870 --> 00:12:52,790
quantitative is almost useless to

263
00:12:52,790 --> 00:12:55,640
describe intentional systems we need to

264
00:12:55,640 --> 00:12:57,860
understand the semantics so promis

265
00:12:57,860 --> 00:12:59,720
theory started as a graph theoretic

266
00:12:59,720 --> 00:13:03,140
language for measuring the intentional

267
00:13:03,140 --> 00:13:06,620
states of systems and describing their

268
00:13:06,620 --> 00:13:09,020
relationships to one another eventually

269
00:13:09,020 --> 00:13:11,170
this led to books which are now my

270
00:13:11,170 --> 00:13:14,240
treatise on systems you can take a look

271
00:13:14,240 --> 00:13:17,150
at some of those but in 2004 I

272
00:13:17,150 --> 00:13:19,520
eventually realized that I came up with

273
00:13:19,520 --> 00:13:22,220
a summary which which we now think of as

274
00:13:22,220 --> 00:13:25,010
promise theory as a kind of graph of

275
00:13:25,010 --> 00:13:27,860
intentions computers are not just

276
00:13:27,860 --> 00:13:29,630
dynamical systems as I'm used to

277
00:13:29,630 --> 00:13:31,760
describing in physics they are

278
00:13:31,760 --> 00:13:34,070
intentional systems they have a purpose

279
00:13:34,070 --> 00:13:36,380
purpose is not something we understand

280
00:13:36,380 --> 00:13:38,180
in physics but it's something was

281
00:13:38,180 --> 00:13:40,220
absolutely essential to understand in

282
00:13:40,220 --> 00:13:43,520
computer science so to baked intent into

283
00:13:43,520 --> 00:13:45,920
a network I needed an another idea and

284
00:13:45,920 --> 00:13:48,680
this concept of promises turned out to

285
00:13:48,680 --> 00:13:53,450
be an answer around this time I got to

286
00:13:53,450 --> 00:13:55,730
know another colleague yarn Bextra who

287
00:13:55,730 --> 00:13:58,100
eventually wrote the promis theory book

288
00:13:58,100 --> 00:14:01,310
with me 10 years later and he got

289
00:14:01,310 --> 00:14:03,140
interested in this his background was in

290
00:14:03,140 --> 00:14:06,650
the logic of processes and at first he

291
00:14:06,650 --> 00:14:08,600
was very skeptical of this notion of

292
00:14:08,600 --> 00:14:10,820
networks and promises and non

293
00:14:10,820 --> 00:14:12,890
determinism because the whole of

294
00:14:12,890 --> 00:14:14,660
computer science is built on the idea of

295
00:14:14,660 --> 00:14:18,800
deterministic change but that he got

296
00:14:18,800 --> 00:14:20,720
more interested in this idea he became

297
00:14:20,720 --> 00:14:23,089
converted towards the idea of promise

298
00:14:23,089 --> 00:14:26,540
theory and became a contributor and he

299
00:14:26,540 --> 00:14:28,010
pushed me to think about things like

300
00:14:28,010 --> 00:14:31,550
trust and the role of what I now call in

301
00:14:31,550 --> 00:14:34,700
the position in networks over many years

302
00:14:34,700 --> 00:14:36,860
we developed started develop develop

303
00:14:36,860 --> 00:14:41,089
this theory and I I realized I could

304
00:14:41,089 --> 00:14:43,610
rewrite cfengine entirely based on this

305
00:14:43,610 --> 00:14:45,170
promise theory given this new

306
00:14:45,170 --> 00:14:46,019
understanding

307
00:14:46,019 --> 00:14:49,110
how networks came together the

308
00:14:49,110 --> 00:14:50,610
interesting part of promise theory for

309
00:14:50,610 --> 00:14:53,399
me is that it exposed a simple algebra

310
00:14:53,399 --> 00:14:56,759
of cooperation that we can describe the

311
00:14:56,759 --> 00:14:59,369
basic ingredients of cooperation in a

312
00:14:59,369 --> 00:15:01,350
network independent of programming

313
00:15:01,350 --> 00:15:04,019
languages independent of tools it's

314
00:15:04,019 --> 00:15:07,769
simply about one party having something

315
00:15:07,769 --> 00:15:09,629
that can be offered something they can

316
00:15:09,629 --> 00:15:12,389
intend to do another party's been

317
00:15:12,389 --> 00:15:15,389
willing to make use of that intention to

318
00:15:15,389 --> 00:15:17,579
do something and the communication

319
00:15:17,579 --> 00:15:19,799
between them building up networks in

320
00:15:19,799 --> 00:15:23,639
this way revealed that both it's not

321
00:15:23,639 --> 00:15:27,179
like him it's not wasn't like the

322
00:15:27,179 --> 00:15:28,769
regular theory of networks where you

323
00:15:28,769 --> 00:15:30,619
push packets and packets are received

324
00:15:30,619 --> 00:15:33,839
automatically it's more like you for

325
00:15:33,839 --> 00:15:35,819
something and the other party has to

326
00:15:35,819 --> 00:15:36,540
accept it

327
00:15:36,540 --> 00:15:39,449
as we see more in cases of access

328
00:15:39,449 --> 00:15:42,360
control insecurity for example this

329
00:15:42,360 --> 00:15:44,790
meant that networks are actually more

330
00:15:44,790 --> 00:15:46,439
complicated than we'd given them credit

331
00:15:46,439 --> 00:15:49,949
for queuing theory and network analysis

332
00:15:49,949 --> 00:15:52,889
you had to understand the intentions the

333
00:15:52,889 --> 00:15:54,990
policies of both parties to understand

334
00:15:54,990 --> 00:15:57,269
how interactions would take place so all

335
00:15:57,269 --> 00:15:59,999
these ideas started to come together at

336
00:15:59,999 --> 00:16:02,579
the time I was an associate professor at

337
00:16:02,579 --> 00:16:06,389
the University of Oslo and so this is a

338
00:16:06,389 --> 00:16:08,519
hired but but I became I was nominated

339
00:16:08,519 --> 00:16:11,639
to become a full professor and for those

340
00:16:11,639 --> 00:16:13,199
of you don't know a full professor a

341
00:16:13,199 --> 00:16:17,100
fully unwanted professor is this strange

342
00:16:17,100 --> 00:16:20,519
animal which has to be appointed by an

343
00:16:20,519 --> 00:16:22,589
International Committee on my committee

344
00:16:22,589 --> 00:16:25,439
was Stephanie Forrest from Santa Fe

345
00:16:25,439 --> 00:16:26,100
Institute

346
00:16:26,100 --> 00:16:28,439
University of New Mexico who was also

347
00:16:28,439 --> 00:16:30,299
interested in this idea of computer

348
00:16:30,299 --> 00:16:32,959
immunology but for security purposes and

349
00:16:32,959 --> 00:16:35,639
I met some of her colleagues over time

350
00:16:35,639 --> 00:16:39,059
and this helped to develop the notion of

351
00:16:39,059 --> 00:16:42,179
immunology in interactions for security

352
00:16:42,179 --> 00:16:44,399
policy we can think of the maintenance

353
00:16:44,399 --> 00:16:47,040
of a system as the correction of errors

354
00:16:47,040 --> 00:16:49,679
relative to its policy a little bit like

355
00:16:49,679 --> 00:16:53,129
the copying of a tree so we began to

356
00:16:53,129 --> 00:16:56,819
develop this idea and over time began to

357
00:16:56,819 --> 00:16:58,850
see how these networks of

358
00:16:58,850 --> 00:17:00,980
connections between not only machines

359
00:17:00,980 --> 00:17:04,569
but different states could form a proper

360
00:17:04,569 --> 00:17:08,059
semi mathematical theory of intent it

361
00:17:08,059 --> 00:17:10,459
became clear from studying the machine

362
00:17:10,459 --> 00:17:12,919
learning traces that we couldn't

363
00:17:12,919 --> 00:17:16,039
understand computers simply by on the

364
00:17:16,039 --> 00:17:18,349
basis of what we wanted we also could

365
00:17:18,349 --> 00:17:21,709
see the influence of humans on the

366
00:17:21,709 --> 00:17:24,470
system in the traces in the graphs and

367
00:17:24,470 --> 00:17:28,309
the resource dependencies and this meant

368
00:17:28,309 --> 00:17:31,039
that computers will won't necessarily do

369
00:17:31,039 --> 00:17:32,539
what we want them to do as the

370
00:17:32,539 --> 00:17:34,850
programmers they will do something which

371
00:17:34,850 --> 00:17:36,799
is related to what everyone in the world

372
00:17:36,799 --> 00:17:39,049
is trying to get them to do and in the

373
00:17:39,049 --> 00:17:41,450
age of the internet influences come from

374
00:17:41,450 --> 00:17:43,340
all around the world at all times

375
00:17:43,340 --> 00:17:46,090
especially on very busy service

376
00:17:46,090 --> 00:17:49,970
performing services online so what do I

377
00:17:49,970 --> 00:17:52,820
want to say about promise theory for me

378
00:17:52,820 --> 00:17:55,789
this has been sometimes difficult

379
00:17:55,789 --> 00:17:58,280
personal journey the computer science

380
00:17:58,280 --> 00:18:00,380
community certainly tried to reject it

381
00:18:00,380 --> 00:18:02,690
in the beginning and still do today I

382
00:18:02,690 --> 00:18:05,600
still get hate mail from some some parts

383
00:18:05,600 --> 00:18:07,429
of the world what I want to get out of

384
00:18:07,429 --> 00:18:09,710
this is a sense of bringing computer

385
00:18:09,710 --> 00:18:12,710
science or computer technology into the

386
00:18:12,710 --> 00:18:14,720
realm of science in a way that it hasn't

387
00:18:14,720 --> 00:18:18,049
been in the past making things work is

388
00:18:18,049 --> 00:18:22,100
not science it's technology to do

389
00:18:22,100 --> 00:18:24,049
science we need to have an understanding

390
00:18:24,049 --> 00:18:29,299
a theory and we need to connect it to a

391
00:18:29,299 --> 00:18:31,909
bigger picture one of the interesting

392
00:18:31,909 --> 00:18:34,039
aspects to come out of promise theory is

393
00:18:34,039 --> 00:18:35,650
its connection to knowledge

394
00:18:35,650 --> 00:18:38,330
representations and now what we would

395
00:18:38,330 --> 00:18:41,299
think of as artificial intelligence from

396
00:18:41,299 --> 00:18:42,789
the simple machine learning that I

397
00:18:42,789 --> 00:18:46,789
implemented back in the mid 90s to deep

398
00:18:46,789 --> 00:18:49,780
learning tools that are available today

399
00:18:49,780 --> 00:18:51,950
machine learning has come a long way but

400
00:18:51,950 --> 00:18:53,929
artificial intelligence and knowledge

401
00:18:53,929 --> 00:18:55,909
representation goes far beyond things

402
00:18:55,909 --> 00:18:59,020
like that it goes to graphs of

403
00:18:59,020 --> 00:19:01,640
representations between concepts which

404
00:19:01,640 --> 00:19:03,890
connects processing to the theory of

405
00:19:03,890 --> 00:19:06,740
computation and beyond and this is an

406
00:19:06,740 --> 00:19:08,510
aspect of promise theory which I think

407
00:19:08,510 --> 00:19:10,820
can still be developed more in the

408
00:19:10,820 --> 00:19:11,879
future

409
00:19:11,879 --> 00:19:13,440
and it's going to be really important to

410
00:19:13,440 --> 00:19:16,499
understand how to build our future

411
00:19:16,499 --> 00:19:18,899
systems there are many lessons that come

412
00:19:18,899 --> 00:19:20,969
out of this and many general principles

413
00:19:20,969 --> 00:19:23,129
that come out of the basic elements of

414
00:19:23,129 --> 00:19:25,829
the algebra of cooperation another one

415
00:19:25,829 --> 00:19:27,979
that was very interesting for me was

416
00:19:27,979 --> 00:19:31,499
later I got to know my friend and

417
00:19:31,499 --> 00:19:33,569
collaborator daniel mezack who came out

418
00:19:33,569 --> 00:19:37,379
of the agile community and he got

419
00:19:37,379 --> 00:19:39,989
interested in applying promise theory to

420
00:19:39,989 --> 00:19:41,729
the notion of how humans work together

421
00:19:41,729 --> 00:19:45,919
and especially manage and lead teams in

422
00:19:45,919 --> 00:19:48,719
organizations to undergo change the

423
00:19:48,719 --> 00:19:50,489
notion of change in human systems quite

424
00:19:50,489 --> 00:19:52,379
interesting of course humans are very

425
00:19:52,379 --> 00:19:54,539
different kinds of agents to the kinds

426
00:19:54,539 --> 00:19:57,089
of machine agents that typically run

427
00:19:57,089 --> 00:19:59,099
computer networks but still the

428
00:19:59,099 --> 00:20:00,839
principles of cooperation are the same

429
00:20:00,839 --> 00:20:03,929
how one agent will make an offer or a

430
00:20:03,929 --> 00:20:06,690
promise to another another agent has to

431
00:20:06,690 --> 00:20:09,149
accept that and in order to make use of

432
00:20:09,149 --> 00:20:12,440
it that coordination and cooperation

433
00:20:12,440 --> 00:20:14,999
doesn't take care of itself it requires

434
00:20:14,999 --> 00:20:18,299
careful alignment of the kind that we

435
00:20:18,299 --> 00:20:21,089
tend to take for granted in IT and we

436
00:20:21,089 --> 00:20:23,339
absolutely shouldn't gradually over time

437
00:20:23,339 --> 00:20:25,829
as as IT systems came to study more

438
00:20:25,829 --> 00:20:27,479
complex networks of interaction

439
00:20:27,479 --> 00:20:29,849
especially in the case of services and

440
00:20:29,849 --> 00:20:33,419
so called micro services the algebra of

441
00:20:33,419 --> 00:20:36,269
cooperation between them has played an

442
00:20:36,269 --> 00:20:38,009
important role in how we understand the

443
00:20:38,009 --> 00:20:40,979
scaling of systems and those basic

444
00:20:40,979 --> 00:20:44,279
principles of self-healing desired end

445
00:20:44,279 --> 00:20:46,409
states automatic error correction that

446
00:20:46,409 --> 00:20:49,229
were built into cfengine became adopted

447
00:20:49,229 --> 00:20:52,799
in tools like kubernetes and the own and

448
00:20:52,799 --> 00:20:56,339
the auto scaling elastic scaling

449
00:20:56,339 --> 00:20:58,169
functions that we see in cloud today and

450
00:20:58,169 --> 00:21:01,409
take for granted today so I feel very

451
00:21:01,409 --> 00:21:04,309
much that those early studies although

452
00:21:04,309 --> 00:21:06,719
rejected by computer science some very

453
00:21:06,719 --> 00:21:08,509
much have indicated in the field of

454
00:21:08,509 --> 00:21:12,149
practical computer practical computing

455
00:21:12,149 --> 00:21:14,519
so with that I'm going to leave the

456
00:21:14,519 --> 00:21:17,849
origins of promise theory for now and I

457
00:21:17,849 --> 00:21:20,269
hope you will all have a fantastic day

458
00:21:20,269 --> 00:21:23,609
giving your own talks and perhaps some

459
00:21:23,609 --> 00:21:25,470
of you will revisit some of my

460
00:21:25,470 --> 00:21:27,870
books and I certainly hope to hear back

461
00:21:27,870 --> 00:21:30,840
from you in the future so have a great

462
00:21:30,840 --> 00:21:41,659
day and stay safe oh hello Mike

463
00:21:41,659 --> 00:21:49,159
hi how are you I'm doing fine okay

464
00:21:51,299 --> 00:21:55,799
okay we have some questions here so the

465
00:21:55,799 --> 00:21:58,950
first one is how do you see the

466
00:21:58,950 --> 00:22:01,590
relationship of that set-off and promise

467
00:22:01,590 --> 00:22:06,539
Terry this is a great question Patrick

468
00:22:06,539 --> 00:22:08,340
and I had a bit of a discussion about

469
00:22:08,340 --> 00:22:11,250
this online a couple of weeks back I

470
00:22:11,250 --> 00:22:13,049
think those are there's a lot of ways

471
00:22:13,049 --> 00:22:15,150
that it's promised theory can can

472
00:22:15,150 --> 00:22:18,870
contribute to death cycles even in

473
00:22:18,870 --> 00:22:22,380
DevOps of course DevOps became famous

474
00:22:22,380 --> 00:22:26,340
for being about cooperation between the

475
00:22:26,340 --> 00:22:28,230
dev teams and the operations team rather

476
00:22:28,230 --> 00:22:30,330
than simply throwing things over the

477
00:22:30,330 --> 00:22:33,750
wall imposing upon one another expected

478
00:22:33,750 --> 00:22:37,080
without really communicating so the idea

479
00:22:37,080 --> 00:22:39,570
that we can understand that more deeply

480
00:22:39,570 --> 00:22:41,940
with a theory of corporations obviously

481
00:22:41,940 --> 00:22:44,850
an advantage one of the things we talked

482
00:22:44,850 --> 00:22:46,940
about in that session was also where

483
00:22:46,940 --> 00:22:50,960
security fits in because whereas perhaps

484
00:22:50,960 --> 00:22:54,179
developers and operations folks have

485
00:22:54,179 --> 00:22:57,090
clear things to work on and can make

486
00:22:57,090 --> 00:22:59,580
changes for themselves security people

487
00:22:59,580 --> 00:23:01,919
often have to seek the cooperation of

488
00:23:01,919 --> 00:23:04,200
others to get their stuff done and not

489
00:23:04,200 --> 00:23:06,120
directly with a hand on a lead row

490
00:23:06,120 --> 00:23:07,980
pushing a button or something like that

491
00:23:07,980 --> 00:23:12,059
so it's I think there's a lot to me what

492
00:23:12,059 --> 00:23:15,570
a lot of places where cooperation of an

493
00:23:15,570 --> 00:23:18,750
idea plays a big role in in dev ops and

494
00:23:18,750 --> 00:23:25,770
dev seconds okay any advice to new

495
00:23:25,770 --> 00:23:32,010
people in the field you people in the

496
00:23:32,010 --> 00:23:33,929
field should definitely read as much as

497
00:23:33,929 --> 00:23:36,929
they can look back at old ideas because

498
00:23:36,929 --> 00:23:39,350
you know not everything is brand new

499
00:23:39,350 --> 00:23:41,999
don't believe that we just showed me the

500
00:23:41,999 --> 00:23:45,720
code is not the right answer to study up
