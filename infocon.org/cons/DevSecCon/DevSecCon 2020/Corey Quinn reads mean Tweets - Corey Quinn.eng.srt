1
00:00:00,160 --> 00:00:02,720
my man corey quinn corey how you doing

2
00:00:02,720 --> 00:00:03,120
not

3
00:00:03,120 --> 00:00:04,880
dead yet way to oversell it you always

4
00:00:04,880 --> 00:00:06,560
want to set expectations low

5
00:00:06,560 --> 00:00:08,240
and then people's surprises are all

6
00:00:08,240 --> 00:00:09,920
pleasant if you over promise you become

7
00:00:09,920 --> 00:00:11,599
an enterprise software vendor

8
00:00:11,599 --> 00:00:13,040
it's only because i love you baby but

9
00:00:13,040 --> 00:00:14,960
you know i'm uh i'm gonna kick it over

10
00:00:14,960 --> 00:00:16,320
to you i'm gonna sit here and try not to

11
00:00:16,320 --> 00:00:18,640
spit my coffee out

12
00:00:18,640 --> 00:00:20,800
sounds good to me uh i want to start off

13
00:00:20,800 --> 00:00:22,000
by apologizing to

14
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:23,519
basically everyone because there's been

15
00:00:23,519 --> 00:00:25,599
a misunderstanding when people heard i

16
00:00:25,599 --> 00:00:26,320
was going to be

17
00:00:26,320 --> 00:00:28,640
reading mean tweets they thought that i

18
00:00:28,640 --> 00:00:30,080
was going to be reading

19
00:00:30,080 --> 00:00:32,238
the nasty things that people had said to

20
00:00:32,238 --> 00:00:33,440
me on twitter

21
00:00:33,440 --> 00:00:35,600
but that's not what this talk is going

22
00:00:35,600 --> 00:00:36,480
to be about

23
00:00:36,480 --> 00:00:38,239
the reason behind that is that most of

24
00:00:38,239 --> 00:00:40,079
you aren't particularly creative

25
00:00:40,079 --> 00:00:42,239
and reading the nonsense that you folks

26
00:00:42,239 --> 00:00:43,920
send me when you're trying to be both

27
00:00:43,920 --> 00:00:44,399
mean

28
00:00:44,399 --> 00:00:47,280
and funny at the same time is both

29
00:00:47,280 --> 00:00:48,399
disappointing

30
00:00:48,399 --> 00:00:51,920
as well as kind of sad so if i spotlight

31
00:00:51,920 --> 00:00:54,160
the small handful of genuinely mean

32
00:00:54,160 --> 00:00:56,480
things that people have said to me i'll

33
00:00:56,480 --> 00:00:58,719
be reinforcing the exact wrong behavior

34
00:00:58,719 --> 00:01:00,879
plus giving some of the worst people in

35
00:01:00,879 --> 00:01:03,199
the world some unneeded publicity

36
00:01:03,199 --> 00:01:05,199
and i don't think we need more of larry

37
00:01:05,199 --> 00:01:07,439
ellison taking time to shitpost on my

38
00:01:07,439 --> 00:01:08,320
timeline

39
00:01:08,320 --> 00:01:10,240
so instead what i'm going to inflict

40
00:01:10,240 --> 00:01:12,880
upon you for the next yeah 15 minutes

41
00:01:12,880 --> 00:01:15,840
is mean tweets that i've written a few

42
00:01:15,840 --> 00:01:17,200
of them i've sent before

43
00:01:17,200 --> 00:01:18,560
but most of them have just been

44
00:01:18,560 --> 00:01:20,240
polluting my drafts holder

45
00:01:20,240 --> 00:01:22,320
because either the timing wasn't right

46
00:01:22,320 --> 00:01:23,920
or i thought at the time

47
00:01:23,920 --> 00:01:26,560
they were going to be far too mean now

48
00:01:26,560 --> 00:01:27,520
that the world is

49
00:01:27,520 --> 00:01:29,600
locked inside during an isolating

50
00:01:29,600 --> 00:01:30,640
pandemic

51
00:01:30,640 --> 00:01:32,880
it seemed like the right time for me to

52
00:01:32,880 --> 00:01:34,400
indulge my absolute

53
00:01:34,400 --> 00:01:37,439
worst instincts by lashing out now

54
00:01:37,439 --> 00:01:38,799
the reason that most of these didn't get

55
00:01:38,799 --> 00:01:40,960
sent is because contrary to what folks

56
00:01:40,960 --> 00:01:42,720
may believe there are rules to

57
00:01:42,720 --> 00:01:45,520
my snark i don't punch down i punch up

58
00:01:45,520 --> 00:01:47,119
so i only ever make fun of large

59
00:01:47,119 --> 00:01:47,840
companies

60
00:01:47,840 --> 00:01:50,720
it's why i own twitterforpets.com i

61
00:01:50,720 --> 00:01:52,399
needed a fake startup that i can make

62
00:01:52,399 --> 00:01:52,960
fun of

63
00:01:52,960 --> 00:01:54,479
instead of crapping on people's hard

64
00:01:54,479 --> 00:01:56,960
work i also don't make fun of people

65
00:01:56,960 --> 00:01:57,439
because

66
00:01:57,439 --> 00:01:59,040
even if the person themselves is a

67
00:01:59,040 --> 00:02:00,560
complete dumpster goblin

68
00:02:00,560 --> 00:02:03,360
they presumably have friends and family

69
00:02:03,360 --> 00:02:04,719
that care about them

70
00:02:04,719 --> 00:02:07,040
who would be hurt or take offense on

71
00:02:07,040 --> 00:02:08,239
their behalf

72
00:02:08,239 --> 00:02:10,160
that does of course mean that oracle

73
00:02:10,160 --> 00:02:12,319
co-founder larry ellison is fair game

74
00:02:12,319 --> 00:02:14,160
because he has no friends or family who

75
00:02:14,160 --> 00:02:15,360
care about him at all

76
00:02:15,360 --> 00:02:17,680
so who would be left to be offended uh

77
00:02:17,680 --> 00:02:19,440
one last thing before i dive in

78
00:02:19,440 --> 00:02:21,200
there aren't going to be any slides this

79
00:02:21,200 --> 00:02:23,120
time just my smiling face because video

80
00:02:23,120 --> 00:02:23,680
is hard

81
00:02:23,680 --> 00:02:25,200
and screen sharing isn't really that

82
00:02:25,200 --> 00:02:27,040
awesome on my computer just

83
00:02:27,040 --> 00:02:28,879
because of the truly excessive amounts

84
00:02:28,879 --> 00:02:30,879
of kubernetes erotic fan fiction that

85
00:02:30,879 --> 00:02:32,400
are scattered across all of my different

86
00:02:32,400 --> 00:02:33,519
browser tabs

87
00:02:33,519 --> 00:02:35,920
i also basically be reading my slides to

88
00:02:35,920 --> 00:02:37,440
you and frankly that sort of thing

89
00:02:37,440 --> 00:02:38,879
isn't appropriate for any kind of

90
00:02:38,879 --> 00:02:40,400
conference talk that isn't an oracle

91
00:02:40,400 --> 00:02:42,239
open world keynote

92
00:02:42,239 --> 00:02:44,000
but what i'm going to do instead in an

93
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:45,280
experimental test is

94
00:02:45,280 --> 00:02:47,599
live tweet my own talk as i go in a

95
00:02:47,599 --> 00:02:48,319
thread

96
00:02:48,319 --> 00:02:49,920
if you're on twitter you can follow

97
00:02:49,920 --> 00:02:55,120
along at quinnypig that's q-u-i-n-y-pig

98
00:02:55,120 --> 00:02:58,000
so now without further ado we begin with

99
00:02:58,000 --> 00:02:59,040
mean tweets

100
00:02:59,040 --> 00:03:01,920
that i have written

101
00:03:03,599 --> 00:03:06,319
ibm has had two brand name projects in

102
00:03:06,319 --> 00:03:07,599
the past century

103
00:03:07,599 --> 00:03:10,720
watson and the holocaust i don't think

104
00:03:10,720 --> 00:03:12,000
that ibm cloud

105
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:15,680
is shaping up to be the third

106
00:03:15,760 --> 00:03:18,159
kubernetes solves a bunch of different

107
00:03:18,159 --> 00:03:19,280
business problems

108
00:03:19,280 --> 00:03:20,879
according to folks who think which

109
00:03:20,879 --> 00:03:22,560
container runtime do i use

110
00:03:22,560 --> 00:03:25,599
is a business problem

111
00:03:25,920 --> 00:03:29,680
the aws partners sticking up for aws's

112
00:03:29,680 --> 00:03:30,400
behavior

113
00:03:30,400 --> 00:03:32,959
in the open source world feels kind of

114
00:03:32,959 --> 00:03:33,440
like

115
00:03:33,440 --> 00:03:36,080
aws trotting out hostages who are all

116
00:03:36,080 --> 00:03:36,799
currently

117
00:03:36,799 --> 00:03:38,720
severely suffering from stockholm

118
00:03:38,720 --> 00:03:41,200
syndrome

119
00:03:41,519 --> 00:03:44,319
they say that the best characters never

120
00:03:44,319 --> 00:03:45,840
truly develop

121
00:03:45,840 --> 00:03:47,920
if that were true then why do i have to

122
00:03:47,920 --> 00:03:49,680
instinctively mute the folks who keep

123
00:03:49,680 --> 00:03:51,519
telling me that serverless runs on

124
00:03:51,519 --> 00:03:54,000
servers

125
00:03:54,480 --> 00:03:57,120
if you bill yourself as a full stack

126
00:03:57,120 --> 00:03:58,879
developer in your resume

127
00:03:58,879 --> 00:04:00,560
you're going to hate the interview

128
00:04:00,560 --> 00:04:04,879
questions i ask you about device drivers

129
00:04:04,879 --> 00:04:07,040
if you think google is condescending

130
00:04:07,040 --> 00:04:08,799
wait until you see the bill you get when

131
00:04:08,799 --> 00:04:11,360
you exceed the aws free tier

132
00:04:11,360 --> 00:04:13,920
you should have been smarter some people

133
00:04:13,920 --> 00:04:15,760
tell me i'm condescending

134
00:04:15,760 --> 00:04:19,599
that means i talk down to people

135
00:04:20,160 --> 00:04:23,680
i'm so annoyed by the internal aws

136
00:04:23,680 --> 00:04:24,800
pronunciation

137
00:04:24,800 --> 00:04:27,440
of ami that i've started countering with

138
00:04:27,440 --> 00:04:27,840
my

139
00:04:27,840 --> 00:04:31,360
own pronunciations of postgresql opi

140
00:04:31,360 --> 00:04:34,400
and giraffe db

141
00:04:35,360 --> 00:04:37,520
ever notice that if you want to get

142
00:04:37,520 --> 00:04:38,880
hired at aws

143
00:04:38,880 --> 00:04:40,560
you've got to implement quicksort on the

144
00:04:40,560 --> 00:04:43,120
whiteboard but absolutely none of their

145
00:04:43,120 --> 00:04:44,000
services are

146
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:45,919
ever sorted in anything that even

147
00:04:45,919 --> 00:04:49,680
remotely approaches logical order

148
00:04:50,080 --> 00:04:52,800
given elastic's complete reversal on

149
00:04:52,800 --> 00:04:54,479
maintaining goodwill with their

150
00:04:54,479 --> 00:04:55,199
community

151
00:04:55,199 --> 00:04:57,759
via lawsuits i'm starting to view their

152
00:04:57,759 --> 00:05:00,320
ceo shea bannon as a dollar store brand

153
00:05:00,320 --> 00:05:01,199
larry ellison

154
00:05:01,199 --> 00:05:04,960
only without the redeeming parts

155
00:05:05,440 --> 00:05:07,919
slack sure does run their gums an awful

156
00:05:07,919 --> 00:05:09,840
lot about how to work remotely for a

157
00:05:09,840 --> 00:05:11,919
company that was entirely anti-remote

158
00:05:11,919 --> 00:05:12,639
themselves

159
00:05:12,639 --> 00:05:16,400
until they were forced to change that

160
00:05:17,039 --> 00:05:19,600
azure's had a lot of capacity shortfalls

161
00:05:19,600 --> 00:05:20,400
lately

162
00:05:20,400 --> 00:05:22,560
because they're as surprised as anyone

163
00:05:22,560 --> 00:05:23,680
that companies took

164
00:05:23,680 --> 00:05:27,919
the microsoft cloud seriously

165
00:05:28,160 --> 00:05:31,600
if all you ever do is pivot eventually

166
00:05:31,600 --> 00:05:33,680
all you're capable of doing is sitting

167
00:05:33,680 --> 00:05:36,240
and spinning it feels mean to tag

168
00:05:36,240 --> 00:05:37,520
pivotal in this tweet

169
00:05:37,520 --> 00:05:40,719
but i'm still going to do it

170
00:05:41,039 --> 00:05:43,759
covet 19 relief is great and all but i

171
00:05:43,759 --> 00:05:44,080
hope

172
00:05:44,080 --> 00:05:46,400
sneak or snike or snake embezzles at

173
00:05:46,400 --> 00:05:48,240
least a bit of money from the all

174
00:05:48,240 --> 00:05:50,320
from this conference and uses it to buy

175
00:05:50,320 --> 00:05:52,479
a vowel so i can figure out how the hell

176
00:05:52,479 --> 00:05:55,520
their name is pronounced

177
00:05:55,840 --> 00:05:58,240
you used to be able to win free drinks

178
00:05:58,240 --> 00:06:00,400
by answering ridiculous trivia questions

179
00:06:00,400 --> 00:06:01,199
correctly

180
00:06:01,199 --> 00:06:02,880
now if you answer the ridiculous trivia

181
00:06:02,880 --> 00:06:07,280
correctly you get a job offer at google

182
00:06:07,280 --> 00:06:10,479
it's called serverless because aws legal

183
00:06:10,479 --> 00:06:13,039
shot down its original name of screw you

184
00:06:13,039 --> 00:06:16,240
build it your damn self

185
00:06:16,400 --> 00:06:18,800
amazon chime is globally federated which

186
00:06:18,800 --> 00:06:19,520
means that

187
00:06:19,520 --> 00:06:21,360
amazon chime users can talk to other

188
00:06:21,360 --> 00:06:22,639
amazon chime users

189
00:06:22,639 --> 00:06:24,560
from different companies this is a

190
00:06:24,560 --> 00:06:26,560
forward-looking feature that anticipates

191
00:06:26,560 --> 00:06:27,120
a day

192
00:06:27,120 --> 00:06:29,039
when amazon chime gets a second paying

193
00:06:29,039 --> 00:06:31,520
customer

194
00:06:32,080 --> 00:06:34,800
watching aws and azure have benchmark

195
00:06:34,800 --> 00:06:35,600
wars

196
00:06:35,600 --> 00:06:37,120
is like watching two nerds have the

197
00:06:37,120 --> 00:06:38,880
world's most ineffective

198
00:06:38,880 --> 00:06:41,520
playground slap fight over which nerd is

199
00:06:41,520 --> 00:06:43,600
going to get to ask the teacher to the

200
00:06:43,600 --> 00:06:46,240
school dance

201
00:06:47,199 --> 00:06:50,160
the longer this pandemic drags on the

202
00:06:50,160 --> 00:06:51,919
better the technology decision

203
00:06:51,919 --> 00:06:53,759
companies are going to make this is

204
00:06:53,759 --> 00:06:56,160
entirely due to the lack of executive

205
00:06:56,160 --> 00:06:58,240
exposure to enterprise software ads and

206
00:06:58,240 --> 00:07:00,720
airports

207
00:07:01,440 --> 00:07:03,599
the folks at giant ad tech companies are

208
00:07:03,599 --> 00:07:05,840
going so stir crazy right now

209
00:07:05,840 --> 00:07:08,080
that they're volunteering to build and

210
00:07:08,080 --> 00:07:10,720
release location tracking technology

211
00:07:10,720 --> 00:07:14,960
for free junkie needs their fix

212
00:07:15,360 --> 00:07:18,560
the entire point of the aws marketplace

213
00:07:18,560 --> 00:07:20,400
is to do an end run around your

214
00:07:20,400 --> 00:07:22,639
company's shitty procurement department

215
00:07:22,639 --> 00:07:24,800
the best part is that any company name

216
00:07:24,800 --> 00:07:27,440
in the world could conceivably be an aws

217
00:07:27,440 --> 00:07:28,400
service name

218
00:07:28,400 --> 00:07:30,400
so procurement is never going to catch

219
00:07:30,400 --> 00:07:33,520
on to that particular trick

220
00:07:34,319 --> 00:07:37,360
aws ceo andy jassy didn't

221
00:07:37,360 --> 00:07:39,280
spring fully formed into this world from

222
00:07:39,280 --> 00:07:40,479
the forehead of some god

223
00:07:40,479 --> 00:07:42,560
in fact he started off in amazon

224
00:07:42,560 --> 00:07:44,080
marketing that's right

225
00:07:44,080 --> 00:07:46,080
he's the original systems manager

226
00:07:46,080 --> 00:07:49,039
marketing manager

227
00:07:49,599 --> 00:07:52,240
vmware remains the payday lender of

228
00:07:52,240 --> 00:07:55,039
technical debt

229
00:07:55,840 --> 00:07:59,039
there are kind empathetic warm and

230
00:07:59,039 --> 00:08:00,560
inspirational people

231
00:08:00,560 --> 00:08:03,440
who work at oracle hr is trying to root

232
00:08:03,440 --> 00:08:06,800
them out as fast as they can

233
00:08:07,440 --> 00:08:10,639
if you ever want to sabotage aws

234
00:08:10,639 --> 00:08:12,720
all you have to do is give them a puppy

235
00:08:12,720 --> 00:08:14,560
and then tell them to name it

236
00:08:14,560 --> 00:08:16,560
six more months of no feature releases

237
00:08:16,560 --> 00:08:19,120
coming up

238
00:08:19,759 --> 00:08:22,800
it's going to be a while before tech

239
00:08:22,800 --> 00:08:25,039
conferences come back in person as an

240
00:08:25,039 --> 00:08:26,400
event people go to

241
00:08:26,400 --> 00:08:28,240
other than pete cheslock's lightning

242
00:08:28,240 --> 00:08:29,680
talk about the vasa

243
00:08:29,680 --> 00:08:31,840
i can't think of any other talks i'd be

244
00:08:31,840 --> 00:08:33,839
willing to risk my life to attend in

245
00:08:33,839 --> 00:08:36,240
person

246
00:08:36,559 --> 00:08:39,039
ibm bought red hat because that's what

247
00:08:39,039 --> 00:08:41,120
all the cool kids are into these days

248
00:08:41,120 --> 00:08:42,799
someday we're going to have to find

249
00:08:42,799 --> 00:08:44,480
better phrasing for this than

250
00:08:44,480 --> 00:08:46,880
ibm found dead on the toilet straining

251
00:08:46,880 --> 00:08:49,519
for relevance

252
00:08:49,839 --> 00:08:52,640
maybe it's already happened ibm is one

253
00:08:52,640 --> 00:08:54,000
of those companies that could go out of

254
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:55,120
business tomorrow

255
00:08:55,120 --> 00:08:56,800
and some of its divisions wouldn't hear

256
00:08:56,800 --> 00:09:00,399
about it for another five years

257
00:09:00,959 --> 00:09:03,279
i'm reading microsoft's 10k filing with

258
00:09:03,279 --> 00:09:04,240
the sec

259
00:09:04,240 --> 00:09:06,399
and i can't find the risk factor of

260
00:09:06,399 --> 00:09:08,240
people might take us seriously when we

261
00:09:08,240 --> 00:09:10,480
call ourselves a hyperscale public cloud

262
00:09:10,480 --> 00:09:13,600
so azure gets full

263
00:09:14,560 --> 00:09:16,959
the first big in-person tech conference

264
00:09:16,959 --> 00:09:18,240
after this pandemic

265
00:09:18,240 --> 00:09:20,880
subsides will mostly be attended by

266
00:09:20,880 --> 00:09:23,040
staff that the c-suite deems

267
00:09:23,040 --> 00:09:25,760
the most expendable please prove me

268
00:09:25,760 --> 00:09:26,480
wrong

269
00:09:26,480 --> 00:09:28,800
sorry badge scanning attack interns

270
00:09:28,800 --> 00:09:31,599
you're the tribute

271
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:34,160
raise your hand if you have a friend who

272
00:09:34,160 --> 00:09:36,399
works for apple i

273
00:09:36,399 --> 00:09:39,279
obviously can't see you but that's okay

274
00:09:39,279 --> 00:09:40,880
because nobody has a friend who works

275
00:09:40,880 --> 00:09:41,680
for apple

276
00:09:41,680 --> 00:09:43,600
we instead used to have friends who went

277
00:09:43,600 --> 00:09:45,279
to go work for apple and then we just

278
00:09:45,279 --> 00:09:48,560
kind of lost touch with them

279
00:09:48,640 --> 00:09:51,279
amazon is fanatically devoted to

280
00:09:51,279 --> 00:09:52,480
diversity

281
00:09:52,480 --> 00:09:54,720
true their executive leadership or s

282
00:09:54,720 --> 00:09:56,080
team and this is true

283
00:09:56,080 --> 00:09:58,800
has fewer women on it than guys named

284
00:09:58,800 --> 00:09:59,519
jeff

285
00:09:59,519 --> 00:10:02,079
but at least their apis are incredibly

286
00:10:02,079 --> 00:10:02,720
diverse

287
00:10:02,720 --> 00:10:06,800
between different aws services

288
00:10:07,279 --> 00:10:09,600
if you think you're past your prime and

289
00:10:09,600 --> 00:10:11,680
no longer attractive to anyone

290
00:10:11,680 --> 00:10:14,640
try becoming an oracle customer nobody

291
00:10:14,640 --> 00:10:14,959
has

292
00:10:14,959 --> 00:10:17,120
ever been more interested in screwing

293
00:10:17,120 --> 00:10:19,440
you

294
00:10:19,440 --> 00:10:21,680
it's a mystery why zoom is what

295
00:10:21,680 --> 00:10:23,040
everyone's using to chat

296
00:10:23,040 --> 00:10:24,399
instead of google's offerings of

297
00:10:24,399 --> 00:10:26,320
hangouts chat hangouts meet

298
00:10:26,320 --> 00:10:29,760
google talk huddle aloe hangouts duo

299
00:10:29,760 --> 00:10:32,800
buzz wave google voice messages spaces

300
00:10:32,800 --> 00:10:33,920
or this year's version

301
00:10:33,920 --> 00:10:36,640
google chat

302
00:10:37,040 --> 00:10:39,519
the most savage attack ad i think i've

303
00:10:39,519 --> 00:10:40,320
ever seen

304
00:10:40,320 --> 00:10:42,320
was that time that zoom bought everyone

305
00:10:42,320 --> 00:10:43,839
a month of webex

306
00:10:43,839 --> 00:10:47,120
and suggested they use it

307
00:10:47,120 --> 00:10:49,519
it feels like we fell into a time warp

308
00:10:49,519 --> 00:10:50,880
into the distant past

309
00:10:50,880 --> 00:10:53,120
over the past year suddenly everyone's

310
00:10:53,120 --> 00:10:54,480
talking about cobol

311
00:10:54,480 --> 00:10:56,720
there's a global plague and matt

312
00:10:56,720 --> 00:11:01,200
stratton went to work for red hat

313
00:11:01,200 --> 00:11:03,920
one of the real victims of this pandemic

314
00:11:03,920 --> 00:11:04,240
is

315
00:11:04,240 --> 00:11:07,040
j paul reed because air travel is way

316
00:11:07,040 --> 00:11:07,680
down

317
00:11:07,680 --> 00:11:09,440
and now he's going to have nothing to

318
00:11:09,440 --> 00:11:12,640
give conference talks about

319
00:11:13,040 --> 00:11:15,839
i make an awful lot of jokes about using

320
00:11:15,839 --> 00:11:17,920
route 53 as a database

321
00:11:17,920 --> 00:11:20,880
for the record route 53 is not a

322
00:11:20,880 --> 00:11:21,680
database

323
00:11:21,680 --> 00:11:25,760
but then again neither is redis

324
00:11:25,839 --> 00:11:28,240
when i first started my company i was

325
00:11:28,240 --> 00:11:30,399
worried that aws would fix the bills and

326
00:11:30,399 --> 00:11:32,240
then drive me out of business super

327
00:11:32,240 --> 00:11:32,959
quickly

328
00:11:32,959 --> 00:11:35,200
four years in i'm now worried that they

329
00:11:35,200 --> 00:11:37,839
never will

330
00:11:38,399 --> 00:11:41,200
every day i check the list of cancelled

331
00:11:41,200 --> 00:11:41,760
things

332
00:11:41,760 --> 00:11:44,079
in the vain hope that kubernetes is on

333
00:11:44,079 --> 00:11:46,239
it

334
00:11:47,120 --> 00:11:49,600
at moments like this i wonder what world

335
00:11:49,600 --> 00:11:50,399
we live in

336
00:11:50,399 --> 00:11:52,480
if more of the greatest minds of our

337
00:11:52,480 --> 00:11:54,399
generation had gone into medicine

338
00:11:54,399 --> 00:11:56,160
instead of trying to figure out how to

339
00:11:56,160 --> 00:11:59,680
get people to click more ads

340
00:12:00,560 --> 00:12:02,800
where do you think you'll be when a

341
00:12:02,800 --> 00:12:05,600
covid19 vaccine is announced

342
00:12:05,600 --> 00:12:07,519
if you're a vc you'll probably be

343
00:12:07,519 --> 00:12:09,680
writing a self-congratulatory medium

344
00:12:09,680 --> 00:12:11,839
post

345
00:12:12,800 --> 00:12:15,279
an awful lot of folks are spending eight

346
00:12:15,279 --> 00:12:15,839
grand

347
00:12:15,839 --> 00:12:18,399
on video and audio equipment without

348
00:12:18,399 --> 00:12:20,560
stopping to think whether anyone cares

349
00:12:20,560 --> 00:12:21,760
what they have to say

350
00:12:21,760 --> 00:12:25,120
in the first place

351
00:12:25,120 --> 00:12:27,200
if i ever need to look busy in an office

352
00:12:27,200 --> 00:12:28,240
ever again

353
00:12:28,240 --> 00:12:30,160
i'm going to install a windows 95

354
00:12:30,160 --> 00:12:32,079
virtual machine fire up disk

355
00:12:32,079 --> 00:12:32,959
defragmenter

356
00:12:32,959 --> 00:12:34,800
and tell my boss i'm rebalancing

357
00:12:34,800 --> 00:12:39,600
kubernetes workloads in the data center

358
00:12:39,600 --> 00:12:41,920
i'm repurposing conference t-shirts to

359
00:12:41,920 --> 00:12:44,399
make masks but there are some exceptions

360
00:12:44,399 --> 00:12:46,720
look i'm not saying i'd rather die than

361
00:12:46,720 --> 00:12:48,160
wear a splunk mask

362
00:12:48,160 --> 00:12:49,839
just that i'd have to think about it for

363
00:12:49,839 --> 00:12:53,519
a minute first

364
00:12:53,519 --> 00:12:55,839
the climate right now is starting to

365
00:12:55,839 --> 00:12:57,760
recover as carbon emissions are

366
00:12:57,760 --> 00:13:00,000
way down across the board people aren't

367
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:00,800
driving

368
00:13:00,800 --> 00:13:02,959
plus softbank has stopped shoveling

369
00:13:02,959 --> 00:13:05,040
money into the dumpster volcano that is

370
00:13:05,040 --> 00:13:07,439
we work

371
00:13:07,839 --> 00:13:10,480
not to spoil things for anyone but if

372
00:13:10,480 --> 00:13:12,880
you watch until the end of netflix

373
00:13:12,880 --> 00:13:16,800
the boss is super hard

374
00:13:17,440 --> 00:13:19,519
to be very clear because i do get

375
00:13:19,519 --> 00:13:20,560
questions about this

376
00:13:20,560 --> 00:13:23,040
i'm not saying that larry ellison would

377
00:13:23,040 --> 00:13:24,639
strangle a puppy to death

378
00:13:24,639 --> 00:13:27,279
just to watch it suffer i'm saying he

379
00:13:27,279 --> 00:13:28,320
already did

380
00:13:28,320 --> 00:13:29,920
and that puppy's name was sun

381
00:13:29,920 --> 00:13:32,719
microsystems

382
00:13:33,040 --> 00:13:36,560
it says something really messed up

383
00:13:36,560 --> 00:13:38,560
at a profound level about our society

384
00:13:38,560 --> 00:13:40,079
that essential workers

385
00:13:40,079 --> 00:13:42,160
is just a rebranding of people without

386
00:13:42,160 --> 00:13:44,959
health insurance

387
00:13:45,120 --> 00:13:47,120
if you have no idea what either of these

388
00:13:47,120 --> 00:13:48,720
two things are you'd think that the

389
00:13:48,720 --> 00:13:50,480
amazon global accelerator

390
00:13:50,480 --> 00:13:52,639
and the microsoft reactor were in a race

391
00:13:52,639 --> 00:13:54,160
to see which could destroy the planet

392
00:13:54,160 --> 00:13:54,800
first

393
00:13:54,800 --> 00:13:57,120
also nobody knows what the hell either

394
00:13:57,120 --> 00:14:00,079
of those two things are

395
00:14:00,800 --> 00:14:02,720
burning man is canceled this year

396
00:14:02,720 --> 00:14:04,399
proving that if you look hard enough

397
00:14:04,399 --> 00:14:06,480
there really is a silver lining to

398
00:14:06,480 --> 00:14:08,959
everything

399
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:11,680
the nutters have started talking about

400
00:14:11,680 --> 00:14:14,160
how 5g is a conspiracy that's killing

401
00:14:14,160 --> 00:14:16,399
people and causing the coronavirus

402
00:14:16,399 --> 00:14:18,079
and the most ridiculous thing about that

403
00:14:18,079 --> 00:14:19,760
entire spiel is that the government

404
00:14:19,760 --> 00:14:21,040
would be that competent

405
00:14:21,040 --> 00:14:24,160
at doing anything

406
00:14:24,399 --> 00:14:27,839
the super bowl gdpr and kovid 19

407
00:14:27,839 --> 00:14:30,160
have one thing in common unfortunately

408
00:14:30,160 --> 00:14:31,519
that one thing is

409
00:14:31,519 --> 00:14:33,279
serve as an excuse for that company you

410
00:14:33,279 --> 00:14:35,279
bought a hinge from in 2008

411
00:14:35,279 --> 00:14:38,320
to email you again

412
00:14:39,199 --> 00:14:43,279
army versus ami json versus yaml

413
00:14:43,279 --> 00:14:46,320
serverless versus containers tabs versus

414
00:14:46,320 --> 00:14:46,880
spaces

415
00:14:46,880 --> 00:14:48,800
vim versus emacs no matter where you

416
00:14:48,800 --> 00:14:50,000
stand on these issues

417
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:52,160
we can all agree on one thing it's

418
00:14:52,160 --> 00:14:54,079
better to scream at strangers about them

419
00:14:54,079 --> 00:14:57,360
than it is to do our actual jobs

420
00:14:57,360 --> 00:14:59,199
that concludes me cleaning out my

421
00:14:59,199 --> 00:15:00,560
twitter drafts folder

422
00:15:00,560 --> 00:15:04,000
for the past quarter now perhaps

423
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:05,519
you didn't find any of those tweets

424
00:15:05,519 --> 00:15:07,120
funny perhaps

425
00:15:07,120 --> 00:15:09,360
you were a fool jeff do we have any

426
00:15:09,360 --> 00:15:11,600
questions

427
00:15:11,600 --> 00:15:14,240
we do have one question uh from a guy by

428
00:15:14,240 --> 00:15:14,959
the name of

429
00:15:14,959 --> 00:15:18,000
maddie my question for corey is what

430
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:20,240
advice do you have to be more funny on

431
00:15:20,240 --> 00:15:22,560
twitter

432
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:26,079
that is a great question uh because the

433
00:15:26,079 --> 00:15:27,440
problem honestly first

434
00:15:27,440 --> 00:15:29,759
uh step one matt you need this advice

435
00:15:29,759 --> 00:15:31,440
secondly

436
00:15:31,440 --> 00:15:32,480
in fairness you're pretty good at this

437
00:15:32,480 --> 00:15:34,639
one but a lot of folks conflate being

438
00:15:34,639 --> 00:15:36,079
funny with being mean

439
00:15:36,079 --> 00:15:38,480
and crapping on things and you can do

440
00:15:38,480 --> 00:15:40,160
that but it's not an either or

441
00:15:40,160 --> 00:15:41,920
uh the short answer is i don't know i

442
00:15:41,920 --> 00:15:43,759
have a personality defect that manifests

443
00:15:43,759 --> 00:15:45,839
itself this way

444
00:15:45,839 --> 00:15:47,360
was that the only question hopefully or

445
00:15:47,360 --> 00:15:48,959
were there actually uh useful ones in

446
00:15:48,959 --> 00:15:49,440
there

447
00:15:49,440 --> 00:15:50,959
yeah nope that's the only question we've

448
00:15:50,959 --> 00:15:52,800
got let me check the other uh

449
00:15:52,800 --> 00:15:56,160
the other channel but

450
00:15:56,160 --> 00:15:58,399
i enjoyed it i i have to say i think the

451
00:15:58,399 --> 00:16:00,160
most savage was of course the

452
00:16:00,160 --> 00:16:02,399
vmware the payday lenders of technical

453
00:16:02,399 --> 00:16:03,839
debt yeah of course it was

454
00:16:03,839 --> 00:16:05,279
but one thing i want to point out though

455
00:16:05,279 --> 00:16:06,959
too is that these these are rough times

456
00:16:06,959 --> 00:16:08,000
in seriousness uh please

457
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:10,399
take care of yourself and be kind to one

458
00:16:10,399 --> 00:16:11,199
another

459
00:16:11,199 --> 00:16:12,880
the fact is that one day we're going to

460
00:16:12,880 --> 00:16:14,560
talk to one another about how

461
00:16:14,560 --> 00:16:16,480
we all made this through this but that's

462
00:16:16,480 --> 00:16:17,759
only because the we

463
00:16:17,759 --> 00:16:19,680
is the people who did not the people who

464
00:16:19,680 --> 00:16:20,800
didn't so

465
00:16:20,800 --> 00:16:23,360
please stay safe i'm cory quinn and if

466
00:16:23,360 --> 00:16:25,040
you enjoyed this talk you can find me at

467
00:16:25,040 --> 00:16:26,959
last week in aws.com

468
00:16:26,959 --> 00:16:28,800
if you didn't enjoy this talk my name is

469
00:16:28,800 --> 00:16:30,399
matt stratton and because i work for red

470
00:16:30,399 --> 00:16:32,480
hat i'm now only reachable via telegram

471
00:16:32,480 --> 00:16:34,000
and fax

472
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:36,399
uh we did have one other last minute uh

473
00:16:36,399 --> 00:16:38,000
uh question come through so why does

474
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:39,680
twitter have draft you don't just tweet

475
00:16:39,680 --> 00:16:41,759
it as it pops into your head

476
00:16:41,759 --> 00:16:43,360
uh there are some things where ooh i

477
00:16:43,360 --> 00:16:45,040
could do that but that means if i send

478
00:16:45,040 --> 00:16:46,720
it i'm going to get letters

479
00:16:46,720 --> 00:16:49,519
so if i wind up discarding it for later

480
00:16:49,519 --> 00:16:51,680
the things that are too edgy or not

481
00:16:51,680 --> 00:16:54,320
quite appropriate well that's what i

482
00:16:54,320 --> 00:16:55,839
turns out you can basically ship post

483
00:16:55,839 --> 00:16:57,040
your way an entire talk

484
00:16:57,040 --> 00:17:00,160
just by reading the discard pile so a

485
00:17:00,160 --> 00:17:01,920
clarification of matt's question

486
00:17:01,920 --> 00:17:04,000
uh it was more about turning that

487
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:06,000
question around for you how do you get

488
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:09,039
more funny on twitter oh i see at that

489
00:17:09,039 --> 00:17:09,760
point uh

490
00:17:09,760 --> 00:17:11,599
yeah it's i understand my humor is not

491
00:17:11,599 --> 00:17:13,520
for everyone especially because i talk

492
00:17:13,520 --> 00:17:15,280
about technologies that have come out in

493
00:17:15,280 --> 00:17:17,039
the last 40 years but you know

494
00:17:17,039 --> 00:17:18,319
there's different strokes for different

495
00:17:18,319 --> 00:17:21,678
folks matt it happens

496
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:23,280
all right looks like that's the end of

497
00:17:23,280 --> 00:17:25,119
the questions corey good time really

498
00:17:25,119 --> 00:17:26,160
