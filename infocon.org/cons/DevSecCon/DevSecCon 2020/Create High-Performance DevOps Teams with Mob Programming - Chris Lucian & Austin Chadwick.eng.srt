1
00:00:14,920 --> 00:00:17,920
okay

2
00:00:39,120 --> 00:00:42,840
so i'm just waiting for folks to come on

3
00:00:42,840 --> 00:00:44,800
online

4
00:00:44,800 --> 00:00:49,199
hopefully any minute now

5
00:00:52,960 --> 00:00:55,440
all right

6
00:00:56,840 --> 00:00:59,440
yep

7
00:00:59,440 --> 00:01:03,839
all right so you all are live now

8
00:01:04,479 --> 00:01:08,159
hi everybody hi and so this is chris

9
00:01:08,159 --> 00:01:09,840
and austin and they're going to be

10
00:01:09,840 --> 00:01:12,560
leading a workshop slash talk on

11
00:01:12,560 --> 00:01:14,640
mob programming and i'm going to let you

12
00:01:14,640 --> 00:01:15,840
all introduce yourself

13
00:01:15,840 --> 00:01:19,360
and with that let's keep get going

14
00:01:19,360 --> 00:01:20,960
all right while chris is bringing up the

15
00:01:20,960 --> 00:01:22,720
slides i'll introduce us a little bit

16
00:01:22,720 --> 00:01:25,119
so my name is austin chadwick and

17
00:01:25,119 --> 00:01:27,040
co-presenting and hosting today is

18
00:01:27,040 --> 00:01:29,520
chris solution and we're both mob

19
00:01:29,520 --> 00:01:30,400
programmers

20
00:01:30,400 --> 00:01:32,799
and this session here at the conference

21
00:01:32,799 --> 00:01:33,759
we'll be

22
00:01:33,759 --> 00:01:36,159
sharing about mob programming and devops

23
00:01:36,159 --> 00:01:38,079
and how they work really well together

24
00:01:38,079 --> 00:01:39,280
and then following that we're going to

25
00:01:39,280 --> 00:01:41,280
be doing a workshop that's kind of going

26
00:01:41,280 --> 00:01:44,320
off of this official conference uh

27
00:01:44,320 --> 00:01:46,479
but uh that's already full but if you're

28
00:01:46,479 --> 00:01:48,000
interested please reach out to us

29
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:49,920
on our twitter candles which we'll show

30
00:01:49,920 --> 00:01:51,759
here in a minute uh when we start

31
00:01:51,759 --> 00:01:53,439
sharing screens and maybe we'll do

32
00:01:53,439 --> 00:01:54,960
something like it again

33
00:01:54,960 --> 00:01:58,079
yeah so uh to our

34
00:01:58,079 --> 00:02:01,280
facilitator uh i believe our slides are

35
00:02:01,280 --> 00:02:03,600
attempting to be shown but they're not

36
00:02:03,600 --> 00:02:05,840
currently on the stream

37
00:02:05,840 --> 00:02:07,759
we're gonna get some help with that

38
00:02:07,759 --> 00:02:10,318
gotta love remote live right

39
00:02:10,318 --> 00:02:13,680
technology hey there we go

40
00:02:13,680 --> 00:02:16,239
now we're live all right all right so i

41
00:02:16,239 --> 00:02:17,520
think i already kind of covered the

42
00:02:17,520 --> 00:02:18,959
intro chris you can go ahead and kick it

43
00:02:18,959 --> 00:02:20,400
off and uh get us going on the next

44
00:02:20,400 --> 00:02:21,200
slide

45
00:02:21,200 --> 00:02:23,040
okay uh we'll we'll introduce ourselves

46
00:02:23,040 --> 00:02:24,560
more and maybe our history a little bit

47
00:02:24,560 --> 00:02:27,440
uh in a later slide but we can kind of

48
00:02:27,440 --> 00:02:29,760
get right into the action a little bit

49
00:02:29,760 --> 00:02:32,720
um so i'll let uh austin kind of kick us

50
00:02:32,720 --> 00:02:33,840
off here with

51
00:02:33,840 --> 00:02:36,270
uh why experiment

52
00:02:36,270 --> 00:02:37,680
[Music]

53
00:02:37,680 --> 00:02:40,400
sure sure so uh as you see chris and i

54
00:02:40,400 --> 00:02:41,760
will kind of be having a conversation of

55
00:02:41,760 --> 00:02:43,599
slides here and so the first thing is

56
00:02:43,599 --> 00:02:45,040
we'll be explaining what mod programming

57
00:02:45,040 --> 00:02:46,720
is but why experiment with it

58
00:02:46,720 --> 00:02:50,480
uh from my experience from not doing mod

59
00:02:50,480 --> 00:02:51,760
programming and then doing mod

60
00:02:51,760 --> 00:02:52,800
programming i saw a

61
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:56,000
huge jump in the things you see here

62
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:58,640
continuous delivery low work in progress

63
00:02:58,640 --> 00:02:59,840
development joy

64
00:02:59,840 --> 00:03:02,959
clean code psychological safety and uh

65
00:03:02,959 --> 00:03:03,360
so

66
00:03:03,360 --> 00:03:05,519
many other teams around the world have

67
00:03:05,519 --> 00:03:07,680
uh tried out mob programming and found

68
00:03:07,680 --> 00:03:09,440
it's amplified many of these excellent

69
00:03:09,440 --> 00:03:11,519
things and while we can't

70
00:03:11,519 --> 00:03:14,400
uh uh seriously recommend anything to

71
00:03:14,400 --> 00:03:16,080
you we can share what's worked for us

72
00:03:16,080 --> 00:03:18,239
and for me that's why i think it's

73
00:03:18,239 --> 00:03:19,440
worthwhile experiment

74
00:03:19,440 --> 00:03:21,040
experimenting with mob programming with

75
00:03:21,040 --> 00:03:22,879
devops in particular

76
00:03:22,879 --> 00:03:25,440
yeah anything to add to that chris yeah

77
00:03:25,440 --> 00:03:26,159
um

78
00:03:26,159 --> 00:03:29,920
you know maybe some of these uh phrases

79
00:03:29,920 --> 00:03:31,519
have some explanation that can go along

80
00:03:31,519 --> 00:03:33,760
with them so low work in progress

81
00:03:33,760 --> 00:03:36,799
is like a lean concept so so we've seen

82
00:03:36,799 --> 00:03:39,680
a lot of the lean stuff uh happen quite

83
00:03:39,680 --> 00:03:40,640
a bit more

84
00:03:40,640 --> 00:03:42,560
talk a little bit more about that later

85
00:03:42,560 --> 00:03:44,080
continuous delivery is a big one in the

86
00:03:44,080 --> 00:03:44,959
devops

87
00:03:44,959 --> 00:03:48,879
space clean code bug zero we've seen

88
00:03:48,879 --> 00:03:52,480
the team that austin and i work on is

89
00:03:52,480 --> 00:03:54,799
uh has experienced a year and a half on

90
00:03:54,799 --> 00:03:55,519
a single

91
00:03:55,519 --> 00:03:58,000
mob with no bugs reported from

92
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:00,319
production releasing two times a day

93
00:04:00,319 --> 00:04:03,760
we use a lot of

94
00:04:03,760 --> 00:04:06,239
concepts like development joy to

95
00:04:06,239 --> 00:04:08,000
evaluate the things that

96
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:11,200
we have and it's been a

97
00:04:11,200 --> 00:04:16,318
pretty cool experience for sure um

98
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:21,040
right on so uh

99
00:04:21,040 --> 00:04:23,840
i can talk a little bit about just the

100
00:04:23,840 --> 00:04:25,680
technical aspects of it so

101
00:04:25,680 --> 00:04:27,280
you could probably take a screenshot of

102
00:04:27,280 --> 00:04:28,800
this but

103
00:04:28,800 --> 00:04:30,560
these are some of the practices that we

104
00:04:30,560 --> 00:04:32,880
use we have a core development process

105
00:04:32,880 --> 00:04:36,320
and and put together for this talk uh

106
00:04:36,320 --> 00:04:38,160
we've put together a little bit of a

107
00:04:38,160 --> 00:04:39,759
core devops process

108
00:04:39,759 --> 00:04:43,120
just talking about the every all all

109
00:04:43,120 --> 00:04:44,560
developments mobbed all

110
00:04:44,560 --> 00:04:47,680
devops are mobs we bring in

111
00:04:47,680 --> 00:04:49,600
uh people from the offside and things

112
00:04:49,600 --> 00:04:50,720
we'll talk about

113
00:04:50,720 --> 00:04:52,639
about that a little bit more but you'll

114
00:04:52,639 --> 00:04:55,280
notice here that we have a key focus on

115
00:04:55,280 --> 00:04:56,080
quality and so

116
00:04:56,080 --> 00:04:57,919
on the development side we have

117
00:04:57,919 --> 00:04:59,520
automated testing

118
00:04:59,520 --> 00:05:02,080
automated ui tests a lot of these key

119
00:05:02,080 --> 00:05:03,759
refactoring concepts to make things

120
00:05:03,759 --> 00:05:04,960
extensible

121
00:05:04,960 --> 00:05:08,479
on the core devops process you'll see a

122
00:05:08,479 --> 00:05:09,600
lot of the other things that are

123
00:05:09,600 --> 00:05:10,080
available

124
00:05:10,080 --> 00:05:13,600
too and maybe austin you can take this

125
00:05:13,600 --> 00:05:14,479
one

126
00:05:14,479 --> 00:05:15,919
yeah so as you saw in the last slide

127
00:05:15,919 --> 00:05:17,440
there was a lot of things in there like

128
00:05:17,440 --> 00:05:18,479
uh

129
00:05:18,479 --> 00:05:20,400
automated infrastructure as code you

130
00:05:20,400 --> 00:05:21,919
know automated tests

131
00:05:21,919 --> 00:05:24,960
uh feature development and often if you

132
00:05:24,960 --> 00:05:26,320
look at this slide here

133
00:05:26,320 --> 00:05:28,000
traditionally though each of those

134
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:29,360
functions are

135
00:05:29,360 --> 00:05:31,680
isolated and siloed and specialized

136
00:05:31,680 --> 00:05:32,800
right so you have a

137
00:05:32,800 --> 00:05:34,240
you know on the left part of the slide

138
00:05:34,240 --> 00:05:36,560
you have developments isolated from ops

139
00:05:36,560 --> 00:05:38,479
and ops is isolated from qa

140
00:05:38,479 --> 00:05:41,600
and qa is isolated from security and so

141
00:05:41,600 --> 00:05:44,400
how do you uh how do we do all those

142
00:05:44,400 --> 00:05:46,720
things for every card for every feature

143
00:05:46,720 --> 00:05:47,759
we're working on

144
00:05:47,759 --> 00:05:51,039
for software system and

145
00:05:51,039 --> 00:05:53,680
uh get all those things done all the way

146
00:05:53,680 --> 00:05:54,639
to production

147
00:05:54,639 --> 00:05:56,720
if everyone's distant and not talking to

148
00:05:56,720 --> 00:05:58,240
each other right and so i think one

149
00:05:58,240 --> 00:05:59,759
thing that was great with the devops

150
00:05:59,759 --> 00:06:00,160
movement

151
00:06:00,160 --> 00:06:02,880
is it put people on the same team but

152
00:06:02,880 --> 00:06:03,840
still

153
00:06:03,840 --> 00:06:05,919
you can especially remote maybe people

154
00:06:05,919 --> 00:06:06,880
aren't uh

155
00:06:06,880 --> 00:06:09,360
talking as much and so people are

156
00:06:09,360 --> 00:06:11,199
passing from what they'll do one part of

157
00:06:11,199 --> 00:06:12,400
a card and then they'll pass it to the

158
00:06:12,400 --> 00:06:14,319
next person the next person

159
00:06:14,319 --> 00:06:16,880
uh and so me working that way i seen a

160
00:06:16,880 --> 00:06:17,600
lot of

161
00:06:17,600 --> 00:06:20,400
lag or waste in the system from that way

162
00:06:20,400 --> 00:06:22,720
of operating and so

163
00:06:22,720 --> 00:06:24,080
you know that's what comes to mind to me

164
00:06:24,080 --> 00:06:25,840
with these pictures here is it's been

165
00:06:25,840 --> 00:06:26,880
difficult to achieve

166
00:06:26,880 --> 00:06:28,560
all those awesome things in that last

167
00:06:28,560 --> 00:06:30,960
diagram when we're not talking to each

168
00:06:30,960 --> 00:06:31,919
other

169
00:06:31,919 --> 00:06:33,520
in ways that could make it much more

170
00:06:33,520 --> 00:06:35,199
efficient uh

171
00:06:35,199 --> 00:06:36,319
yeah do you have anything to add to that

172
00:06:36,319 --> 00:06:38,400
one chris yeah so

173
00:06:38,400 --> 00:06:40,400
so there are fences in between

174
00:06:40,400 --> 00:06:41,759
everything uh

175
00:06:41,759 --> 00:06:43,280
there so when you when you hear the turn

176
00:06:43,280 --> 00:06:45,120
throw it over the fence we talk a lot

177
00:06:45,120 --> 00:06:45,759
about

178
00:06:45,759 --> 00:06:48,800
resource efficiency uh and

179
00:06:48,800 --> 00:06:52,240
flow efficiency so we we like this

180
00:06:52,240 --> 00:06:54,160
uh ted talk and we send it to a lot of

181
00:06:54,160 --> 00:06:55,360
people and

182
00:06:55,360 --> 00:06:57,759
it's called the efficiency paradox and

183
00:06:57,759 --> 00:07:00,000
he talks a lot about this idea that

184
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:02,880
you're going to individual resources and

185
00:07:02,880 --> 00:07:03,280
uh

186
00:07:03,280 --> 00:07:04,720
and he talks a lot about the healthcare

187
00:07:04,720 --> 00:07:07,039
system and when they're siloed it might

188
00:07:07,039 --> 00:07:07,759
be that they're in

189
00:07:07,759 --> 00:07:10,160
entirely different buildings and you

190
00:07:10,160 --> 00:07:11,599
know for

191
00:07:11,599 --> 00:07:14,000
for systems that i've seen in the past

192
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:15,440
ops and dev

193
00:07:15,440 --> 00:07:17,039
completely different building that

194
00:07:17,039 --> 00:07:18,639
they're in let alone

195
00:07:18,639 --> 00:07:21,280
walking up and talking to them and the

196
00:07:21,280 --> 00:07:22,720
closer that i've been

197
00:07:22,720 --> 00:07:25,039
while doing software development to

198
00:07:25,039 --> 00:07:26,479
somebody in an office site

199
00:07:26,479 --> 00:07:28,160
the more face-to-face collaboration we

200
00:07:28,160 --> 00:07:31,039
have so flow efficiency allows for

201
00:07:31,039 --> 00:07:34,639
this idea of uh um basically getting

202
00:07:34,639 --> 00:07:36,000
everybody in the same place and getting

203
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:37,599
an item all the way out so take a look

204
00:07:37,599 --> 00:07:38,960
at that

205
00:07:38,960 --> 00:07:41,440
yeah and so uh so lean is about

206
00:07:41,440 --> 00:07:42,560
eliminating waste

207
00:07:42,560 --> 00:07:44,879
and uh value streams map are great

208
00:07:44,879 --> 00:07:47,039
exercise to do and you can see uh one we

209
00:07:47,039 --> 00:07:47,840
drew here

210
00:07:47,840 --> 00:07:50,160
and it takes a it talks about each step

211
00:07:50,160 --> 00:07:51,120
it takes

212
00:07:51,120 --> 00:07:53,120
to go from an ideation all the way to

213
00:07:53,120 --> 00:07:55,199
production to the users right

214
00:07:55,199 --> 00:07:58,160
and what i've noticed is when a lot of

215
00:07:58,160 --> 00:07:59,680
companies and organizations focus on

216
00:07:59,680 --> 00:08:00,479
resource

217
00:08:00,479 --> 00:08:02,080
efficiency going back to the previous

218
00:08:02,080 --> 00:08:04,319
slide make everyone very busy

219
00:08:04,319 --> 00:08:06,800
in their specialization but then what it

220
00:08:06,800 --> 00:08:08,400
leads to is a lot of wait time in

221
00:08:08,400 --> 00:08:09,840
between each piece

222
00:08:09,840 --> 00:08:11,919
right and so drawing out a value stream

223
00:08:11,919 --> 00:08:12,960
map will help make this

224
00:08:12,960 --> 00:08:16,080
obvious right so specialist a does

225
00:08:16,080 --> 00:08:18,080
their you know development and then they

226
00:08:18,080 --> 00:08:19,280
pass it over the wall and then there's a

227
00:08:19,280 --> 00:08:20,720
wait time to the next thing

228
00:08:20,720 --> 00:08:23,120
and so mapping it all out helps you see

229
00:08:23,120 --> 00:08:24,879
where your issues are

230
00:08:24,879 --> 00:08:26,960
and uh so and i'll talk a little about

231
00:08:26,960 --> 00:08:28,400
this one so

232
00:08:28,400 --> 00:08:30,319
talking a little about devops and

233
00:08:30,319 --> 00:08:31,840
mobbing uh we want to

234
00:08:31,840 --> 00:08:32,958
talk a little about ourselves so you

235
00:08:32,958 --> 00:08:35,360
know where we're coming from uh so

236
00:08:35,360 --> 00:08:37,839
my name's austin chad as i said before

237
00:08:37,839 --> 00:08:39,440
uh i've been a software

238
00:08:39,440 --> 00:08:41,599
engineer for about 15 years and i've

239
00:08:41,599 --> 00:08:43,919
worn many many different hats you know

240
00:08:43,919 --> 00:08:46,000
from business analyst to developer to

241
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:47,920
tester to scrum master

242
00:08:47,920 --> 00:08:50,959
uh to writing continuous integration

243
00:08:50,959 --> 00:08:52,880
and continuous delivery for teams and

244
00:08:52,880 --> 00:08:55,279
that being my little silo

245
00:08:55,279 --> 00:08:57,040
and so i've been able to see it all over

246
00:08:57,040 --> 00:08:59,120
the map and all the different roles and

247
00:08:59,120 --> 00:09:01,360
different things that happened and so

248
00:09:01,360 --> 00:09:02,720
i'm actually pretty thankful for that

249
00:09:02,720 --> 00:09:04,880
broad experience how about you chris

250
00:09:04,880 --> 00:09:07,600
yeah um so i'm currently the director of

251
00:09:07,600 --> 00:09:08,720
software development at hunter

252
00:09:08,720 --> 00:09:09,360
industries

253
00:09:09,360 --> 00:09:12,560
and over the years

254
00:09:12,560 --> 00:09:15,040
i've experienced things like no longer

255
00:09:15,040 --> 00:09:17,040
estimating and

256
00:09:17,040 --> 00:09:20,800
also mob programming and

257
00:09:20,800 --> 00:09:23,600
scaling mob programming and now remote

258
00:09:23,600 --> 00:09:25,440
mod programming and

259
00:09:25,440 --> 00:09:28,720
and so a lot of a lot of experiences key

260
00:09:28,720 --> 00:09:30,080
experiences have come to me

261
00:09:30,080 --> 00:09:32,880
uh and i'm a big believer in continuous

262
00:09:32,880 --> 00:09:34,399
improvement continuous learning

263
00:09:34,399 --> 00:09:37,760
and so uh it has a lot to do with that

264
00:09:37,760 --> 00:09:38,320
and so

265
00:09:38,320 --> 00:09:40,399
both austin and i have have been mod

266
00:09:40,399 --> 00:09:42,560
programming for quite some time

267
00:09:42,560 --> 00:09:44,560
he had a previous company i'm a

268
00:09:44,560 --> 00:09:46,560
co-founder of mob programming on the

269
00:09:46,560 --> 00:09:47,680
team that

270
00:09:47,680 --> 00:09:50,480
woody zul was in as well as our other

271
00:09:50,480 --> 00:09:52,000
teammates at the time

272
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:54,320
and since then we've been mobbing all of

273
00:09:54,320 --> 00:09:56,000
our devops as well

274
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:57,760
and so maybe austin you want to talk a

275
00:09:57,760 --> 00:09:58,720
little bit about your history with

276
00:09:58,720 --> 00:10:00,640
mobbing

277
00:10:00,640 --> 00:10:04,160
sure i mean the one thing i'll say is uh

278
00:10:04,160 --> 00:10:05,120
i went from

279
00:10:05,120 --> 00:10:06,800
not mobbing to mobbing and then the

280
00:10:06,800 --> 00:10:08,320
first day of mobbing

281
00:10:08,320 --> 00:10:10,640
full time we pushed feature all the way

282
00:10:10,640 --> 00:10:12,079
to production and it blew me away

283
00:10:12,079 --> 00:10:14,399
i was freaking out i was like is this

284
00:10:14,399 --> 00:10:15,920
really happening so i really saw how

285
00:10:15,920 --> 00:10:17,440
mobbing helps

286
00:10:17,440 --> 00:10:20,399
those efficiencies happen and you know

287
00:10:20,399 --> 00:10:21,519
everything we're going to say today is

288
00:10:21,519 --> 00:10:23,040
going to sound a lot like advice and

289
00:10:23,040 --> 00:10:24,079
prescription

290
00:10:24,079 --> 00:10:25,519
and it's really not you know we can't

291
00:10:25,519 --> 00:10:27,760
really recommend uh anything

292
00:10:27,760 --> 00:10:29,600
uh software development and people in

293
00:10:29,600 --> 00:10:32,480
the connection framework are complicated

294
00:10:32,480 --> 00:10:33,200
complex

295
00:10:33,200 --> 00:10:36,720
chaotic uh and so really what we can do

296
00:10:36,720 --> 00:10:38,640
is share what's worked well for us and

297
00:10:38,640 --> 00:10:40,160
great things we've seen

298
00:10:40,160 --> 00:10:42,720
and then uh you can you know if you're

299
00:10:42,720 --> 00:10:43,920
inspired by that you can take an

300
00:10:43,920 --> 00:10:45,200
experiment with that there's

301
00:10:45,200 --> 00:10:46,800
people are always going to be sharing

302
00:10:46,800 --> 00:10:49,600
things and it's every context is

303
00:10:49,600 --> 00:10:51,279
different right and so

304
00:10:51,279 --> 00:10:54,160
uh you can take it inspect it adapt it

305
00:10:54,160 --> 00:10:55,600
and keep iterating on it

306
00:10:55,600 --> 00:10:57,920
and there's really no prescription one

307
00:10:57,920 --> 00:10:59,760
size fits all for everything

308
00:10:59,760 --> 00:11:01,680
and we just wanted to make that very

309
00:11:01,680 --> 00:11:02,800
clear before we

310
00:11:02,800 --> 00:11:04,160
say a bunch of stuff that sounds like

311
00:11:04,160 --> 00:11:07,279
you all should be doing this

312
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:12,160
yeah yeah definitely and uh

313
00:11:12,160 --> 00:11:13,760
yeah and so mobbing has definitely been

314
00:11:13,760 --> 00:11:15,279
a big part of that for me

315
00:11:15,279 --> 00:11:18,480
uh i've i've become a huge evangelist of

316
00:11:18,480 --> 00:11:18,800
it

317
00:11:18,800 --> 00:11:20,959
uh i can't stop sharing about it it's

318
00:11:20,959 --> 00:11:22,000
just uh

319
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:24,240
it's it's been really fun and i just the

320
00:11:24,240 --> 00:11:25,519
benefits have been so

321
00:11:25,519 --> 00:11:29,279
uh uh you know inspiring

322
00:11:29,279 --> 00:11:31,440
and uh i just love being a part of this

323
00:11:31,440 --> 00:11:32,880
community

324
00:11:32,880 --> 00:11:36,000
yeah all right so uh another another

325
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:37,760
piece of that is that

326
00:11:37,760 --> 00:11:40,800
when we share and

327
00:11:40,800 --> 00:11:44,320
talk about a lot of these things i get

328
00:11:44,320 --> 00:11:46,000
a lot of feedback that's like how how

329
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:47,760
could our organization ever get to where

330
00:11:47,760 --> 00:11:49,200
you are today

331
00:11:49,200 --> 00:11:52,399
and uh and so i think one thing that

332
00:11:52,399 --> 00:11:53,600
everybody needs to kind of come away

333
00:11:53,600 --> 00:11:55,360
from this is that everything can be

334
00:11:55,360 --> 00:11:57,120
iterative and we'll talk a lot about

335
00:11:57,120 --> 00:12:00,560
iteration uh going going forward

336
00:12:00,560 --> 00:12:04,000
on on devops but i i have this i have a

337
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:07,120
saying no practice nb so stop stop

338
00:12:07,120 --> 00:12:08,160
worrying about

339
00:12:08,160 --> 00:12:10,000
what other people are doing and how far

340
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:12,160
along they are just compare yourself

341
00:12:12,160 --> 00:12:15,680
to where you were uh previously and

342
00:12:15,680 --> 00:12:18,800
and work on that and we will

343
00:12:18,800 --> 00:12:21,600
uh and we're just here to provide you

344
00:12:21,600 --> 00:12:23,120
know just like austin's saying

345
00:12:23,120 --> 00:12:25,360
uh sharing and and things along those

346
00:12:25,360 --> 00:12:26,880
lines sharing the difference

347
00:12:26,880 --> 00:12:29,839
so um yeah austin you want to talk about

348
00:12:29,839 --> 00:12:31,839
the danger of complacency

349
00:12:31,839 --> 00:12:33,200
yeah so we're going to be talking about

350
00:12:33,200 --> 00:12:35,279
some meta stuff a little bit before we

351
00:12:35,279 --> 00:12:36,720
jump into

352
00:12:36,720 --> 00:12:39,200
uh specifically what mobbing is and how

353
00:12:39,200 --> 00:12:40,480
it works well with

354
00:12:40,480 --> 00:12:43,120
devops and uh one thing is the danger

355
00:12:43,120 --> 00:12:44,720
complacency and so as chris was talking

356
00:12:44,720 --> 00:12:46,079
about his story a little bit

357
00:12:46,079 --> 00:12:48,079
uh it's it's really you know he's really

358
00:12:48,079 --> 00:12:49,600
passionate about continuous improvement

359
00:12:49,600 --> 00:12:52,079
and i've seen it in many organizations

360
00:12:52,079 --> 00:12:52,800
where

361
00:12:52,800 --> 00:12:54,959
it's just always about getting the next

362
00:12:54,959 --> 00:12:56,160
thing done

363
00:12:56,160 --> 00:12:59,680
and uh it's it's kind of complacent on

364
00:12:59,680 --> 00:13:01,760
uh thinking about your process

365
00:13:01,760 --> 00:13:03,040
inspecting it and

366
00:13:03,040 --> 00:13:04,160
trying to think about how we can get

367
00:13:04,160 --> 00:13:06,399
better and you just start accepting all

368
00:13:06,399 --> 00:13:08,000
the pains that are there

369
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:11,279
uh and and you just kind of you know

370
00:13:11,279 --> 00:13:13,839
and for me i'm i i i like mob with

371
00:13:13,839 --> 00:13:14,880
people who

372
00:13:14,880 --> 00:13:16,320
bring up issues because it helps me not

373
00:13:16,320 --> 00:13:18,160
be complacent yeah

374
00:13:18,160 --> 00:13:19,440
so the way that you might not be

375
00:13:19,440 --> 00:13:21,279
complacent right is this idea of the

376
00:13:21,279 --> 00:13:23,120
virtuous loop so

377
00:13:23,120 --> 00:13:24,720
we talk a lot about this on the mob

378
00:13:24,720 --> 00:13:26,639
mentality show the podcast that austin

379
00:13:26,639 --> 00:13:27,279
and i run

380
00:13:27,279 --> 00:13:30,399
and uh this is uh basically this idea of

381
00:13:30,399 --> 00:13:32,000
dedicated learning time and then

382
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:33,440
retrospectives

383
00:13:33,440 --> 00:13:35,920
and leading to extreme ownership and so

384
00:13:35,920 --> 00:13:36,880
things that

385
00:13:36,880 --> 00:13:38,560
things that engineers don't typically

386
00:13:38,560 --> 00:13:40,160
get in organizations that are

387
00:13:40,160 --> 00:13:42,000
just feature factories for example is

388
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:43,680
dedicated learning time

389
00:13:43,680 --> 00:13:45,680
and they don't reflect on what's gone

390
00:13:45,680 --> 00:13:47,279
well and what's not poorly and so

391
00:13:47,279 --> 00:13:48,959
so the improvement so that's my

392
00:13:48,959 --> 00:13:50,399
definition of of

393
00:13:50,399 --> 00:13:53,199
complacency if you're not reflecting and

394
00:13:53,199 --> 00:13:54,160
changing

395
00:13:54,160 --> 00:13:55,600
and you're not learning then you're

396
00:13:55,600 --> 00:13:57,839
complacent and so that's just kind of my

397
00:13:57,839 --> 00:13:59,839
idea on it um austin do you want to talk

398
00:13:59,839 --> 00:14:00,800
about a little bit about extreme

399
00:14:00,800 --> 00:14:02,399
ownership in its relationship to the

400
00:14:02,399 --> 00:14:04,320
virtuous loop

401
00:14:04,320 --> 00:14:06,320
sure and that ties right into turn off

402
00:14:06,320 --> 00:14:08,079
the good as well is that

403
00:14:08,079 --> 00:14:11,120
if you are reflecting on your process of

404
00:14:11,120 --> 00:14:12,480
retrospectives

405
00:14:12,480 --> 00:14:14,240
and you have time to learn to make

406
00:14:14,240 --> 00:14:16,720
things better you can turn up the good

407
00:14:16,720 --> 00:14:18,320
right and uh this is a concept from

408
00:14:18,320 --> 00:14:19,760
woody zuul

409
00:14:19,760 --> 00:14:21,839
where you make every day you can make an

410
00:14:21,839 --> 00:14:23,120
incremental one percent

411
00:14:23,120 --> 00:14:24,800
improvement right and then over time

412
00:14:24,800 --> 00:14:26,800
that can build and build and build

413
00:14:26,800 --> 00:14:28,639
and you just focus on hey what well

414
00:14:28,639 --> 00:14:30,000
today and what can we turn up to make

415
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:32,480
it better for tomorrow and the way that

416
00:14:32,480 --> 00:14:33,760
extreme ownership plays in

417
00:14:33,760 --> 00:14:36,000
is you really want your teams to own

418
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:37,920
their process and own

419
00:14:37,920 --> 00:14:40,560
their workflows and they can decide and

420
00:14:40,560 --> 00:14:42,639
really change how it works and they can

421
00:14:42,639 --> 00:14:44,320
iterate on that and keep turning up the

422
00:14:44,320 --> 00:14:46,160
good and uh

423
00:14:46,160 --> 00:14:49,040
and mobbing was originally came from

424
00:14:49,040 --> 00:14:50,480
people just turning up the good they

425
00:14:50,480 --> 00:14:52,160
were in that virtuous loop we're talking

426
00:14:52,160 --> 00:14:52,800
about and they're

427
00:14:52,800 --> 00:14:54,240
hey what's working well well it works

428
00:14:54,240 --> 00:14:55,680
well when we do these training things

429
00:14:55,680 --> 00:14:57,040
together we're all together in the same

430
00:14:57,040 --> 00:14:59,040
room working on the same computer

431
00:14:59,040 --> 00:15:01,279
and they and then when they came in we

432
00:15:01,279 --> 00:15:02,160
an issue

433
00:15:02,160 --> 00:15:03,920
with production work they're like hey

434
00:15:03,920 --> 00:15:05,680
let's turn up that good again

435
00:15:05,680 --> 00:15:07,360
and someone asked for help and then they

436
00:15:07,360 --> 00:15:08,800
started working on production work that

437
00:15:08,800 --> 00:15:09,519
way

438
00:15:09,519 --> 00:15:12,000
and so this kind of meta cultural thing

439
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:13,519
of hey let's look for ways to turn up

440
00:15:13,519 --> 00:15:14,399
the good

441
00:15:14,399 --> 00:15:17,199
uh reflect often and then have dedicated

442
00:15:17,199 --> 00:15:18,399
time to learn

443
00:15:18,399 --> 00:15:20,639
to figure out how to do things better

444
00:15:20,639 --> 00:15:21,839
and uh

445
00:15:21,839 --> 00:15:24,399
yes that's what occurs to me for turn up

446
00:15:24,399 --> 00:15:25,120
the good

447
00:15:25,120 --> 00:15:27,279
and if you turn up the good even more

448
00:15:27,279 --> 00:15:29,440
what does that lead to

449
00:15:29,440 --> 00:15:31,519
yeah yeah so remember those silos and

450
00:15:31,519 --> 00:15:32,639
those walls that were talking about

451
00:15:32,639 --> 00:15:33,519
earlier

452
00:15:33,519 --> 00:15:37,279
the the idea is is that you know if

453
00:15:37,279 --> 00:15:39,440
we know that flow efficiency is good

454
00:15:39,440 --> 00:15:41,279
over resource efficiency and we know

455
00:15:41,279 --> 00:15:41,600
that

456
00:15:41,600 --> 00:15:43,839
cubicle cue balls separating everybody

457
00:15:43,839 --> 00:15:45,680
causes a resource efficiency style

458
00:15:45,680 --> 00:15:46,560
environment

459
00:15:46,560 --> 00:15:48,720
what would cause a flow efficiency style

460
00:15:48,720 --> 00:15:50,720
environment and we kind of discovered

461
00:15:50,720 --> 00:15:51,120
this

462
00:15:51,120 --> 00:15:53,920
through serendipity but mod programming

463
00:15:53,920 --> 00:15:56,800
emerged out of that serendipity and now

464
00:15:56,800 --> 00:15:59,199
it's some of the things that we we see

465
00:15:59,199 --> 00:16:00,880
and the results are

466
00:16:00,880 --> 00:16:02,959
sort of obvious when you talk about the

467
00:16:02,959 --> 00:16:05,040
efficiency paradox and you talk about

468
00:16:05,040 --> 00:16:05,600
lean

469
00:16:05,600 --> 00:16:07,040
it's the idea that we can get something

470
00:16:07,040 --> 00:16:09,600
from inception to production

471
00:16:09,600 --> 00:16:11,680
in the shortest amount of time possible

472
00:16:11,680 --> 00:16:12,880
that's different than

473
00:16:12,880 --> 00:16:14,560
fully utilizing every one of our

474
00:16:14,560 --> 00:16:16,720
resources

475
00:16:16,720 --> 00:16:19,279
all right and so uh turning up the good

476
00:16:19,279 --> 00:16:20,000
of having

477
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:22,000
all the different specialists working

478
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:23,759
together dev and ops and security and

479
00:16:23,759 --> 00:16:24,560
tests

480
00:16:24,560 --> 00:16:25,920
uh what does that look like so what is

481
00:16:25,920 --> 00:16:27,600
mo mod programming so we're gonna get a

482
00:16:27,600 --> 00:16:29,279
little bit specific here at least one

483
00:16:29,279 --> 00:16:30,800
way that mod programming is done it can

484
00:16:30,800 --> 00:16:32,320
be done several different ways

485
00:16:32,320 --> 00:16:35,600
but in in basic as woody says it's all

486
00:16:35,600 --> 00:16:37,199
the brilliant minds working on the same

487
00:16:37,199 --> 00:16:38,880
thing at the same time in the

488
00:16:38,880 --> 00:16:41,680
same space and on the same computer so

489
00:16:41,680 --> 00:16:43,600
here you see some pictures of some

490
00:16:43,600 --> 00:16:47,120
programming environments and this is uh

491
00:16:47,120 --> 00:16:49,040
non-remote mob programming there's also

492
00:16:49,040 --> 00:16:51,199
a mob remote version of mob programming

493
00:16:51,199 --> 00:16:52,880
but as you can see everybody is working

494
00:16:52,880 --> 00:16:54,800
on the same computer and collaborating

495
00:16:54,800 --> 00:16:57,360
on the same uh card or work item or

496
00:16:57,360 --> 00:16:57,839
feature

497
00:16:57,839 --> 00:17:01,680
at the same time and it seems radical

498
00:17:01,680 --> 00:17:04,640
and it seems how could it possibly work

499
00:17:04,640 --> 00:17:05,599
and so

500
00:17:05,599 --> 00:17:07,439
you know what here's one anti-pattern of

501
00:17:07,439 --> 00:17:09,119
how it could not work

502
00:17:09,119 --> 00:17:10,720
yeah what is it the driver and the

503
00:17:10,720 --> 00:17:13,119
watchers i actually i heard this uh

504
00:17:13,119 --> 00:17:15,839
from a visitor one day and they were

505
00:17:15,839 --> 00:17:17,679
kind of visiting our environment

506
00:17:17,679 --> 00:17:20,880
and uh and

507
00:17:20,880 --> 00:17:23,439
it came up that it's like okay well in

508
00:17:23,439 --> 00:17:25,439
pair programming i just watch when the

509
00:17:25,439 --> 00:17:27,039
other person's typing

510
00:17:27,039 --> 00:17:28,799
and then they watch me and so it's like

511
00:17:28,799 --> 00:17:30,559
a pair anti-pattern but then

512
00:17:30,559 --> 00:17:32,240
the you know their their next question

513
00:17:32,240 --> 00:17:33,840
was around well

514
00:17:33,840 --> 00:17:35,280
you know what is every so you're having

515
00:17:35,280 --> 00:17:37,360
three people watch instead of just one

516
00:17:37,360 --> 00:17:40,720
and uh so so we say well back up like

517
00:17:40,720 --> 00:17:41,679
that's a little bit different in the

518
00:17:41,679 --> 00:17:43,919
pair programming world even

519
00:17:43,919 --> 00:17:47,039
and uh and even going back to the

520
00:17:47,039 --> 00:17:50,480
uh uh into the mobbing and so

521
00:17:50,480 --> 00:17:53,440
we have a number of ideas or just kind

522
00:17:53,440 --> 00:17:55,600
of ways to anchor people when we're

523
00:17:55,600 --> 00:17:59,520
talking about um uh what people could be

524
00:17:59,520 --> 00:18:00,160
doing

525
00:18:00,160 --> 00:18:02,400
and it's definitely not just watching

526
00:18:02,400 --> 00:18:03,679
the screen

527
00:18:03,679 --> 00:18:06,240
and uh and while somebody else does the

528
00:18:06,240 --> 00:18:06,720
work

529
00:18:06,720 --> 00:18:09,840
um i i especially like the picture here

530
00:18:09,840 --> 00:18:11,919
because i'd probably be that nervous too

531
00:18:11,919 --> 00:18:13,520
if everybody was just watching in

532
00:18:13,520 --> 00:18:15,840
silence that'd be very uncomfortable

533
00:18:15,840 --> 00:18:19,440
for example um and so uh you know

534
00:18:19,440 --> 00:18:22,559
while willem larsen was working with us

535
00:18:22,559 --> 00:18:26,160
he basically had defined a game

536
00:18:26,160 --> 00:18:29,600
and it it had been uh super

537
00:18:29,600 --> 00:18:32,240
super useful so i handed off to austin

538
00:18:32,240 --> 00:18:33,440
yeah sure so he

539
00:18:33,440 --> 00:18:35,760
saw a lot of mobs working really well uh

540
00:18:35,760 --> 00:18:36,640
together

541
00:18:36,640 --> 00:18:39,840
and uh he observed all these different

542
00:18:39,840 --> 00:18:40,880
roles that people

543
00:18:40,880 --> 00:18:44,000
take on while mob programming and we'll

544
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:45,600
be jumping into each of these roles to

545
00:18:45,600 --> 00:18:46,880
kind of give you an idea of what it's

546
00:18:46,880 --> 00:18:47,600
like to

547
00:18:47,600 --> 00:18:50,720
mob program and uh what one example of

548
00:18:50,720 --> 00:18:52,799
what good can look like

549
00:18:52,799 --> 00:18:54,559
again inspect and adapt if you're trying

550
00:18:54,559 --> 00:18:55,919
out mobi and you'll probably come up

551
00:18:55,919 --> 00:18:57,440
with different roles or better ways to

552
00:18:57,440 --> 00:18:58,160
do it

553
00:18:58,160 --> 00:19:00,320
uh but he uh before we jump into

554
00:19:00,320 --> 00:19:02,080
nietzsche role so william larson made a

555
00:19:02,080 --> 00:19:03,760
mod programming rpg game

556
00:19:03,760 --> 00:19:06,160
uh and here's the link on github and you

557
00:19:06,160 --> 00:19:07,679
can play this game and it's a great way

558
00:19:07,679 --> 00:19:08,480
to introduce

559
00:19:08,480 --> 00:19:10,480
mob programming because it forces you to

560
00:19:10,480 --> 00:19:12,480
try on each of the different hats

561
00:19:12,480 --> 00:19:15,679
while you're working on a feature or on

562
00:19:15,679 --> 00:19:16,880
some code or on

563
00:19:16,880 --> 00:19:20,320
some devops work and it gives you and it

564
00:19:20,320 --> 00:19:21,280
gives you points

565
00:19:21,280 --> 00:19:24,640
as you do each of the roles yeah and

566
00:19:24,640 --> 00:19:26,720
uh another another thing kind of a key

567
00:19:26,720 --> 00:19:27,919
that happened um

568
00:19:27,919 --> 00:19:30,720
we first started modding a long time ago

569
00:19:30,720 --> 00:19:31,360
uh

570
00:19:31,360 --> 00:19:34,000
the we had a timer that was telling us

571
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:35,919
to rotate and it was so loud that when i

572
00:19:35,919 --> 00:19:36,960
was getting coffee

573
00:19:36,960 --> 00:19:39,200
on the other side of the office it uh

574
00:19:39,200 --> 00:19:40,000
actually

575
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:43,440
i heard people saying that h is that or

576
00:19:43,440 --> 00:19:45,440
expletives that you might think of

577
00:19:45,440 --> 00:19:47,520
and uh and so i realized that we were

578
00:19:47,520 --> 00:19:48,880
bringing everybody in the office with a

579
00:19:48,880 --> 00:19:50,400
super loud timer because people wouldn't

580
00:19:50,400 --> 00:19:51,840
release the keyboard unless we had a

581
00:19:51,840 --> 00:19:52,240
real

582
00:19:52,240 --> 00:19:55,039
timer i wrote the first version of the

583
00:19:55,039 --> 00:19:57,440
mob timer back then in order to silently

584
00:19:57,440 --> 00:19:59,280
get people to transition uh since then

585
00:19:59,280 --> 00:20:00,160
there have been

586
00:20:00,160 --> 00:20:03,120
tens if not hundreds of others written

587
00:20:03,120 --> 00:20:04,559
this one here is a

588
00:20:04,559 --> 00:20:07,760
worse mob timer from dylan kearns

589
00:20:07,760 --> 00:20:11,600
and uh which is which is quite good and

590
00:20:11,600 --> 00:20:13,120
all these mob timers help everybody

591
00:20:13,120 --> 00:20:15,440
switch and go tap task which

592
00:20:15,440 --> 00:20:18,559
might lead us to combat yeah and so you

593
00:20:18,559 --> 00:20:20,159
know the timer helps you switch who's at

594
00:20:20,159 --> 00:20:21,840
the keyboard whether remotely or in

595
00:20:21,840 --> 00:20:22,799
person

596
00:20:22,799 --> 00:20:25,200
um and uh so another thing that is a

597
00:20:25,200 --> 00:20:26,480
helpful tool while

598
00:20:26,480 --> 00:20:28,799
programming is kanban and so you can

599
00:20:28,799 --> 00:20:30,400
kind of see it behind me in the picture

600
00:20:30,400 --> 00:20:32,320
back there it's a whiteboard

601
00:20:32,320 --> 00:20:35,200
with cards on it and magnets and uh in

602
00:20:35,200 --> 00:20:36,799
the course of any work and especially in

603
00:20:36,799 --> 00:20:38,640
mob programming you have lots of ideas

604
00:20:38,640 --> 00:20:40,400
you know you have the mobbers

605
00:20:40,400 --> 00:20:42,240
uh everyone in the mob and their ideas

606
00:20:42,240 --> 00:20:43,600
and they come up as we're working on

607
00:20:43,600 --> 00:20:44,559
stuff or

608
00:20:44,559 --> 00:20:46,000
we'll be interacting with the customer

609
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:48,400
and they'll have ideas and we basically

610
00:20:48,400 --> 00:20:49,679
just need a place to help

611
00:20:49,679 --> 00:20:52,000
for me at least keep myself sane right

612
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:53,679
so it's good for me to write down the

613
00:20:53,679 --> 00:20:54,960
idea and say hey that's an excellent

614
00:20:54,960 --> 00:20:55,679
idea

615
00:20:55,679 --> 00:20:56,799
we're not working on it right now

616
00:20:56,799 --> 00:20:57,600
because we're in the middle of something

617
00:20:57,600 --> 00:20:59,120
else so let's put it on the wall and to

618
00:20:59,120 --> 00:20:59,840
do

619
00:20:59,840 --> 00:21:03,840
and then it just helps keep us focused

620
00:21:03,840 --> 00:21:05,120
apparently one of our slides got a

621
00:21:05,120 --> 00:21:07,120
little bit messed up here um

622
00:21:07,120 --> 00:21:11,200
the uh let's go back

623
00:21:11,200 --> 00:21:14,559
so uh behind the slide a driver roll

624
00:21:14,559 --> 00:21:17,679
for uh the mob programming roles

625
00:21:17,679 --> 00:21:20,799
and in here uh we

626
00:21:20,799 --> 00:21:23,600
we have um different patterns and you

627
00:21:23,600 --> 00:21:24,799
can go to the website to see

628
00:21:24,799 --> 00:21:26,159
everything that's there you'll see the

629
00:21:26,159 --> 00:21:27,840
driver badge

630
00:21:27,840 --> 00:21:30,159
there oh i i actually see the the racer

631
00:21:30,159 --> 00:21:32,080
helmet on the bar right here

632
00:21:32,080 --> 00:21:36,000
and uh so um what's really

633
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:37,280
interesting about this is this is the

634
00:21:37,280 --> 00:21:40,000
person that might think that they were

635
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:43,360
uh just being watched right um

636
00:21:43,360 --> 00:21:46,400
the the difference though is that uh you

637
00:21:46,400 --> 00:21:47,840
know this person has to be listening to

638
00:21:47,840 --> 00:21:48,880
somebody else so

639
00:21:48,880 --> 00:21:50,960
game uh typing something you disagree

640
00:21:50,960 --> 00:21:52,960
with gets you experience points

641
00:21:52,960 --> 00:21:55,520
using a new keyboard shortcut learning

642
00:21:55,520 --> 00:21:56,880
something new

643
00:21:56,880 --> 00:21:59,280
about the tooling and ignoring direct

644
00:21:59,280 --> 00:22:01,440
instructions who isn't the navigator

645
00:22:01,440 --> 00:22:03,520
um these are all kind of positive

646
00:22:03,520 --> 00:22:05,760
patterns that the driver follows

647
00:22:05,760 --> 00:22:08,320
and and what you don't want to see from

648
00:22:08,320 --> 00:22:10,320
a driver is basically

649
00:22:10,320 --> 00:22:12,320
writing the code that's in their head

650
00:22:12,320 --> 00:22:14,320
and and not verbalizing um

651
00:22:14,320 --> 00:22:17,280
in our department we actually have a

652
00:22:17,280 --> 00:22:18,720
requirement that all

653
00:22:18,720 --> 00:22:21,919
all code is verbalized and this includes

654
00:22:21,919 --> 00:22:22,799
infrastructure as

655
00:22:22,799 --> 00:22:25,520
code and this includes uh security and

656
00:22:25,520 --> 00:22:26,000
and

657
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:29,280
every aspect of devops actually is

658
00:22:29,280 --> 00:22:31,440
said out loud before it becomes

659
00:22:31,440 --> 00:22:32,400
automation

660
00:22:32,400 --> 00:22:34,640
and everything that we do repeatedly we

661
00:22:34,640 --> 00:22:35,520
attempt to

662
00:22:35,520 --> 00:22:39,200
turn into automation gradually um and so

663
00:22:39,200 --> 00:22:41,760
the driver is the one listening to those

664
00:22:41,760 --> 00:22:43,840
those verbalizations and entering them

665
00:22:43,840 --> 00:22:46,480
into the computer um this is this is a

666
00:22:46,480 --> 00:22:47,679
key aspect of this

667
00:22:47,679 --> 00:22:50,559
is that uh the driver should not move

668
00:22:50,559 --> 00:22:51,679
forward

669
00:22:51,679 --> 00:22:54,799
if they if code or or

670
00:22:54,799 --> 00:22:57,360
instruction hasn't been verbalized and

671
00:22:57,360 --> 00:22:58,080
so

672
00:22:58,080 --> 00:22:59,840
um there might also be different levels

673
00:22:59,840 --> 00:23:01,600
of navigation and we'll talk about that

674
00:23:01,600 --> 00:23:04,000
uh in different areas but you interpret

675
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:05,280
whatever's said out loud

676
00:23:05,280 --> 00:23:06,960
and then you ask for higher or lower

677
00:23:06,960 --> 00:23:08,559
levels of navigation so that

678
00:23:08,559 --> 00:23:11,600
you can optimize the amount of things

679
00:23:11,600 --> 00:23:13,039
that you can type in

680
00:23:13,039 --> 00:23:14,720
based on your understanding of what was

681
00:23:14,720 --> 00:23:16,240
navigated and

682
00:23:16,240 --> 00:23:19,200
that's a really important aspect of all

683
00:23:19,200 --> 00:23:21,120
of this

684
00:23:21,120 --> 00:23:23,679
another piece of it is uh you'll notice

685
00:23:23,679 --> 00:23:24,320
that in the

686
00:23:24,320 --> 00:23:26,559
in the picture on the bottom there um

687
00:23:26,559 --> 00:23:28,400
that we have multiple keyboards and mice

688
00:23:28,400 --> 00:23:28,960
and so

689
00:23:28,960 --> 00:23:31,120
kind of setting up your environment uh

690
00:23:31,120 --> 00:23:32,640
how you like it

691
00:23:32,640 --> 00:23:35,039
being remote right now it that's not as

692
00:23:35,039 --> 00:23:36,799
important as being in person but you can

693
00:23:36,799 --> 00:23:38,000
kind of see how

694
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:41,679
uh those things work out

695
00:23:42,080 --> 00:23:44,559
yeah and so uh while doing uh devops

696
00:23:44,559 --> 00:23:45,600
work uh so the

697
00:23:45,600 --> 00:23:47,120
the driver is the one taking the ideas

698
00:23:47,120 --> 00:23:48,640
from the mob and

699
00:23:48,640 --> 00:23:50,080
putting them into the computer so i can

700
00:23:50,080 --> 00:23:51,600
think of examples when i first started

701
00:23:51,600 --> 00:23:52,320
mobbing

702
00:23:52,320 --> 00:23:54,640
we started working on infrastructure as

703
00:23:54,640 --> 00:23:55,440
code

704
00:23:55,440 --> 00:23:58,559
uh to deploy things to production right

705
00:23:58,559 --> 00:24:02,159
and i had little to no idea what i was

706
00:24:02,159 --> 00:24:02,720
doing

707
00:24:02,720 --> 00:24:04,559
and so driving was a great way to learn

708
00:24:04,559 --> 00:24:06,240
and navigating also a great way to learn

709
00:24:06,240 --> 00:24:07,679
if you're the expert you know exactly

710
00:24:07,679 --> 00:24:08,960
what to do hey we're going to write this

711
00:24:08,960 --> 00:24:10,240
script it's going to do this thing we're

712
00:24:10,240 --> 00:24:11,760
going to put it in our pipeline

713
00:24:11,760 --> 00:24:13,279
you verbalize it and the driver will put

714
00:24:13,279 --> 00:24:14,799
it in but even if you don't know what to

715
00:24:14,799 --> 00:24:15,200
do

716
00:24:15,200 --> 00:24:16,960
the navigator can ask the mob say hey i

717
00:24:16,960 --> 00:24:18,320
don't know what to do can you help guide

718
00:24:18,320 --> 00:24:19,679
me here and then they'll explain it to

719
00:24:19,679 --> 00:24:21,039
me as the navigator

720
00:24:21,039 --> 00:24:22,880
and then i'm the funnel of the ideas of

721
00:24:22,880 --> 00:24:24,640
the mob into the driver and i say okay

722
00:24:24,640 --> 00:24:26,400
driver here's what we're going to do

723
00:24:26,400 --> 00:24:29,200
go to line 10 and type this and it's

724
00:24:29,200 --> 00:24:30,000
amazing

725
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:32,080
the rate at which you learn when you uh

726
00:24:32,080 --> 00:24:33,360
take on these roles

727
00:24:33,360 --> 00:24:35,840
of things you didn't know before yeah

728
00:24:35,840 --> 00:24:37,840
and um kind of to add on to that the

729
00:24:37,840 --> 00:24:38,400
mobber

730
00:24:38,400 --> 00:24:41,039
is the next role and and so the game is

731
00:24:41,039 --> 00:24:43,120
divided into levels and so

732
00:24:43,120 --> 00:24:44,880
uh currently just focusing on getting

733
00:24:44,880 --> 00:24:45,919
really good at the driver and the

734
00:24:45,919 --> 00:24:48,080
navigator is the most important thing

735
00:24:48,080 --> 00:24:51,039
and um i i to be a good mobber in

736
00:24:51,039 --> 00:24:51,760
general

737
00:24:51,760 --> 00:24:54,960
uh without going into the other roles

738
00:24:54,960 --> 00:24:57,200
you have this idea of uh yielding to the

739
00:24:57,200 --> 00:24:58,960
less privileged voice so this might mean

740
00:24:58,960 --> 00:25:00,159
that somebody is

741
00:25:00,159 --> 00:25:03,760
uh a junior developer or brand new

742
00:25:03,760 --> 00:25:06,880
and they have an idea uh and a senior

743
00:25:06,880 --> 00:25:08,960
developer has an idea or a senior devops

744
00:25:08,960 --> 00:25:10,320
engineer has an idea

745
00:25:10,320 --> 00:25:12,480
um who should you listen to a lot of

746
00:25:12,480 --> 00:25:13,440
people would say

747
00:25:13,440 --> 00:25:16,640
listen to the senior role um but

748
00:25:16,640 --> 00:25:18,799
we we kind of do the exact opposite if

749
00:25:18,799 --> 00:25:21,039
the senior can't explain their idea well

750
00:25:21,039 --> 00:25:21,600
enough

751
00:25:21,600 --> 00:25:24,159
then the junior role is going to be the

752
00:25:24,159 --> 00:25:25,120
one that

753
00:25:25,120 --> 00:25:27,039
um takes that on so i'll let you tell

754
00:25:27,039 --> 00:25:28,240
this story

755
00:25:28,240 --> 00:25:29,440
yeah and we'll be hitting some more

756
00:25:29,440 --> 00:25:31,679
rules but here's just a story uh from

757
00:25:31,679 --> 00:25:33,760
mob programming with devopses

758
00:25:33,760 --> 00:25:36,880
uh i was working on a mob where uh to

759
00:25:36,880 --> 00:25:39,200
deploy a mobile app to production took

760
00:25:39,200 --> 00:25:41,279
120 manual steps

761
00:25:41,279 --> 00:25:42,720
we wrote them all down and you had to

762
00:25:42,720 --> 00:25:44,480
click through this click through this

763
00:25:44,480 --> 00:25:45,760
and we knew it was painful we didn't

764
00:25:45,760 --> 00:25:47,760
know what to do about it but

765
00:25:47,760 --> 00:25:50,000
uh another mob had recently figured out

766
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:51,440
how to automate all of that

767
00:25:51,440 --> 00:25:55,039
and so that officer devops specialist uh

768
00:25:55,039 --> 00:25:57,520
we he was able to join our mob and then

769
00:25:57,520 --> 00:25:58,240
uh

770
00:25:58,240 --> 00:26:01,279
within a matter of a few iterations we

771
00:26:01,279 --> 00:26:02,559
were deploying to production

772
00:26:02,559 --> 00:26:04,480
instead of avoiding it like the plague

773
00:26:04,480 --> 00:26:05,840
because it took so long

774
00:26:05,840 --> 00:26:09,200
we were deploying to uh production daily

775
00:26:09,200 --> 00:26:10,559
uh through the app store and it's just

776
00:26:10,559 --> 00:26:12,640
such a thrilling experience to go from

777
00:26:12,640 --> 00:26:14,159
all the manual steps to having it all

778
00:26:14,159 --> 00:26:15,760
automated and

779
00:26:15,760 --> 00:26:17,760
i remember this story and one thing i

780
00:26:17,760 --> 00:26:18,960
witnessed is that

781
00:26:18,960 --> 00:26:21,360
this person did research on their own

782
00:26:21,360 --> 00:26:22,880
before bringing it to their mob and then

783
00:26:22,880 --> 00:26:23,279
that

784
00:26:23,279 --> 00:26:25,520
got was brought to everybody else's mob

785
00:26:25,520 --> 00:26:26,480
and so

786
00:26:26,480 --> 00:26:28,240
um this highlights the researcher role

787
00:26:28,240 --> 00:26:29,600
quite a bit because

788
00:26:29,600 --> 00:26:32,400
uh you know this is the idea that you're

789
00:26:32,400 --> 00:26:34,000
you're four people around the computer

790
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:34,559
or or

791
00:26:34,559 --> 00:26:36,159
any number of people around the computer

792
00:26:36,159 --> 00:26:37,600
and so when you

793
00:26:37,600 --> 00:26:40,799
when you uh reach something that is

794
00:26:40,799 --> 00:26:43,919
interesting or uh difficult it's it's

795
00:26:43,919 --> 00:26:45,120
the idea that

796
00:26:45,120 --> 00:26:46,799
any one of those people can open up a

797
00:26:46,799 --> 00:26:48,320
laptop on the side and

798
00:26:48,320 --> 00:26:50,880
start searching and search for relevant

799
00:26:50,880 --> 00:26:52,559
information and documentation

800
00:26:52,559 --> 00:26:55,679
uh blogs websites like stack overflow

801
00:26:55,679 --> 00:26:57,840
things along those lines but

802
00:26:57,840 --> 00:26:59,760
the researcher role is extremely

803
00:26:59,760 --> 00:27:00,960
important because

804
00:27:00,960 --> 00:27:02,799
one piece of flow efficiency is removing

805
00:27:02,799 --> 00:27:05,360
roadblocks as fast as possible

806
00:27:05,360 --> 00:27:08,559
then about this one yeah so uh

807
00:27:08,559 --> 00:27:10,960
there's also kind of interpersonal uh

808
00:27:10,960 --> 00:27:12,640
excellence that needs to happen in a mob

809
00:27:12,640 --> 00:27:15,120
and uh the sponsor is a great role to

810
00:27:15,120 --> 00:27:16,640
help that happen right uh

811
00:27:16,640 --> 00:27:17,919
chris was talking about amplifying the

812
00:27:17,919 --> 00:27:20,399
unheard voice before so it's easy

813
00:27:20,399 --> 00:27:22,080
if you're not careful if this role isn't

814
00:27:22,080 --> 00:27:23,679
activated or someone to

815
00:27:23,679 --> 00:27:25,279
dominate in the mob like they're just

816
00:27:25,279 --> 00:27:27,279
trying to navigate all day long

817
00:27:27,279 --> 00:27:28,880
and there's people who aren't

818
00:27:28,880 --> 00:27:31,279
contributing aren't learning

819
00:27:31,279 --> 00:27:33,679
and what happens often is diversity of

820
00:27:33,679 --> 00:27:35,679
ideas lead to the best uh results in my

821
00:27:35,679 --> 00:27:37,039
experience and so getting

822
00:27:37,039 --> 00:27:39,440
uh calling out you know asking people to

823
00:27:39,440 --> 00:27:40,640
share or

824
00:27:40,640 --> 00:27:42,880
uh picking the least privileged voice or

825
00:27:42,880 --> 00:27:44,559
you know helping boost the mood

826
00:27:44,559 --> 00:27:47,120
you know so uh you know when when we

827
00:27:47,120 --> 00:27:48,559
complete a card or we figured out a

828
00:27:48,559 --> 00:27:50,000
really difficult problem

829
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:52,559
uh to help celebrate that right uh can

830
00:27:52,559 --> 00:27:53,840
really help uh

831
00:27:53,840 --> 00:27:56,320
move the mob along and another another

832
00:27:56,320 --> 00:27:57,360
thing um so

833
00:27:57,360 --> 00:27:59,600
when i was first mobbing and uh i had a

834
00:27:59,600 --> 00:28:02,320
lot of technical expertise in an area

835
00:28:02,320 --> 00:28:04,640
uh i was navigating a lot and so this is

836
00:28:04,640 --> 00:28:06,240
another great advanced role

837
00:28:06,240 --> 00:28:07,600
and when i was navigating a lot i

838
00:28:07,600 --> 00:28:09,919
realized that my voice started to hurt

839
00:28:09,919 --> 00:28:11,760
and and we thought about it i brought it

840
00:28:11,760 --> 00:28:12,960
up in a retrospective and we thought

841
00:28:12,960 --> 00:28:13,919
about it a lot

842
00:28:13,919 --> 00:28:16,640
it was this idea that every person if

843
00:28:16,640 --> 00:28:17,600
you're in a four-person

844
00:28:17,600 --> 00:28:19,440
mob you probably should have everybody

845
00:28:19,440 --> 00:28:21,919
speaking about a quarter of the time

846
00:28:21,919 --> 00:28:25,200
and uh and and that's kind of a good

847
00:28:25,200 --> 00:28:28,240
loose metric on on how

848
00:28:28,240 --> 00:28:30,320
the equality of participation if you

849
00:28:30,320 --> 00:28:31,279
can't get that

850
00:28:31,279 --> 00:28:33,600
then the the rear admiral or navigating

851
00:28:33,600 --> 00:28:34,640
the navigator

852
00:28:34,640 --> 00:28:36,799
is a really great way to uh talk about

853
00:28:36,799 --> 00:28:38,880
it so maybe the rear admiral would

854
00:28:38,880 --> 00:28:40,480
quietly talk into the navigator's ear

855
00:28:40,480 --> 00:28:42,080
and tell them what to navigate

856
00:28:42,080 --> 00:28:44,960
things along those lines yeah and so

857
00:28:44,960 --> 00:28:46,080
another uh

858
00:28:46,080 --> 00:28:48,159
you know a fun story for me with uh

859
00:28:48,159 --> 00:28:50,320
devops mod programming is we were

860
00:28:50,320 --> 00:28:52,320
we had an app we had it basically

861
00:28:52,320 --> 00:28:53,600
working and we wanted to

862
00:28:53,600 --> 00:28:55,520
deploy it you know the smallest piece of

863
00:28:55,520 --> 00:28:56,799
it possible to production to get our

864
00:28:56,799 --> 00:28:58,159
pipeline working and moving

865
00:28:58,159 --> 00:28:59,440
and we were writing the infrastructure

866
00:28:59,440 --> 00:29:01,360
as code manually because we didn't know

867
00:29:01,360 --> 00:29:02,399
any better way

868
00:29:02,399 --> 00:29:05,200
and uh devops more specialist was

869
00:29:05,200 --> 00:29:06,399
walking by and heard what we were doing

870
00:29:06,399 --> 00:29:07,600
he's like oh can i join your mod for a

871
00:29:07,600 --> 00:29:08,000
little bit

872
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:09,679
oh great he's like i've been researching

873
00:29:09,679 --> 00:29:11,600
this tool during my learning time

874
00:29:11,600 --> 00:29:14,640
and within a matter of an hour uh

875
00:29:14,640 --> 00:29:16,880
it automated the infrastructure of code

876
00:29:16,880 --> 00:29:18,960
uh through some command line

877
00:29:18,960 --> 00:29:22,240
uh you know interfaces we did and we had

878
00:29:22,240 --> 00:29:24,399
deployed like six resources into the

879
00:29:24,399 --> 00:29:25,360
cloud

880
00:29:25,360 --> 00:29:26,960
all automatically and then it generated

881
00:29:26,960 --> 00:29:28,640
all the infrastructure as code and it

882
00:29:28,640 --> 00:29:30,399
took one of our mobbers i think a day or

883
00:29:30,399 --> 00:29:32,240
so to believe it really happened he kept

884
00:29:32,240 --> 00:29:33,760
questioning like is this real is this

885
00:29:33,760 --> 00:29:35,919
real and it's just the benefit of having

886
00:29:35,919 --> 00:29:37,679
someone uh come up with us who has the

887
00:29:37,679 --> 00:29:38,640
expertise

888
00:29:38,640 --> 00:29:40,880
yeah and and somebody walking by like

889
00:29:40,880 --> 00:29:41,679
that um

890
00:29:41,679 --> 00:29:44,640
is it the embodiment of the nose uh even

891
00:29:44,640 --> 00:29:45,520
is that

892
00:29:45,520 --> 00:29:47,600
if you see something that is redundant

893
00:29:47,600 --> 00:29:48,799
or could be automated

894
00:29:48,799 --> 00:29:52,640
or refactored and and you call it out

895
00:29:52,640 --> 00:29:54,000
that's kind of the responsibility

896
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:55,840
that knows this is the idea that you

897
00:29:55,840 --> 00:29:57,600
might point out long lines of code

898
00:29:57,600 --> 00:30:00,799
or complex conditionals duplication

899
00:30:00,799 --> 00:30:03,679
um automation that hasn't happened so

900
00:30:03,679 --> 00:30:05,279
this might be infrastructure as code

901
00:30:05,279 --> 00:30:07,279
this might be security checks this might

902
00:30:07,279 --> 00:30:08,000
be

903
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:11,200
a telemetry that then gets

904
00:30:11,200 --> 00:30:13,600
that has been overlooked the nose is

905
00:30:13,600 --> 00:30:14,880
there to kind of sniff out

906
00:30:14,880 --> 00:30:16,960
things that could be added into the

907
00:30:16,960 --> 00:30:18,159
stack that would

908
00:30:18,159 --> 00:30:19,919
ultimately save time and money going

909
00:30:19,919 --> 00:30:21,279
forward and

910
00:30:21,279 --> 00:30:22,799
uh that story is a really great example

911
00:30:22,799 --> 00:30:25,520
of that yeah now one difficult part

912
00:30:25,520 --> 00:30:26,080
about

913
00:30:26,080 --> 00:30:28,080
uh teams whether you're mom program or

914
00:30:28,080 --> 00:30:30,559
not is understanding each other and so

915
00:30:30,559 --> 00:30:31,679
it's easy to have a circular

916
00:30:31,679 --> 00:30:34,159
conversation where like i'm saying a

917
00:30:34,159 --> 00:30:35,760
and then the other person says b and

918
00:30:35,760 --> 00:30:37,360
then we just keep repeating ourselves a

919
00:30:37,360 --> 00:30:37,600
b

920
00:30:37,600 --> 00:30:39,360
a b and it's it's hard to just talk it

921
00:30:39,360 --> 00:30:41,120
through and so the archivist is the role

922
00:30:41,120 --> 00:30:42,480
in the mob who gets up

923
00:30:42,480 --> 00:30:43,919
on the whiteboard and starts drawing and

924
00:30:43,919 --> 00:30:45,679
so we had this recently we were

925
00:30:45,679 --> 00:30:47,600
trying to handle security in the cloud

926
00:30:47,600 --> 00:30:48,720
and write to the right

927
00:30:48,720 --> 00:30:50,080
write the correct infrastructure's code

928
00:30:50,080 --> 00:30:51,760
to set it up appropriately

929
00:30:51,760 --> 00:30:54,320
and uh the archivists many of them stood

930
00:30:54,320 --> 00:30:55,840
up and started drawing their ideas and

931
00:30:55,840 --> 00:30:57,120
we laid out different options with

932
00:30:57,120 --> 00:30:58,559
different diagrams

933
00:30:58,559 --> 00:31:00,159
and then we started to make progress in

934
00:31:00,159 --> 00:31:02,000
our conversation like oh that's what you

935
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:03,919
mean and it's much easier to talk to a

936
00:31:03,919 --> 00:31:04,880
picture

937
00:31:04,880 --> 00:31:08,320
uh than it is to uh just hearing each

938
00:31:08,320 --> 00:31:10,159
other verbally or texting each other in

939
00:31:10,159 --> 00:31:11,600
a slack like system

940
00:31:11,600 --> 00:31:13,360
and so that's a great role that really

941
00:31:13,360 --> 00:31:15,200
helps a ton in

942
00:31:15,200 --> 00:31:17,360
resolving issues this one is a

943
00:31:17,360 --> 00:31:18,720
relatively recent

944
00:31:18,720 --> 00:31:20,799
uh addition to the game and that's the

945
00:31:20,799 --> 00:31:22,640
traffic cop and and i thought about this

946
00:31:22,640 --> 00:31:23,440
when

947
00:31:23,440 --> 00:31:27,279
um when i saw that it's like oh hey

948
00:31:27,279 --> 00:31:29,679
we've kind of slipped on doing kanban or

949
00:31:29,679 --> 00:31:30,880
something along those lines and it's

950
00:31:30,880 --> 00:31:32,320
like oh well

951
00:31:32,320 --> 00:31:34,080
we reminding the team about kanban right

952
00:31:34,080 --> 00:31:35,519
now would be a really good idea and and

953
00:31:35,519 --> 00:31:36,240
so this is

954
00:31:36,240 --> 00:31:39,440
this eventually explicitly became

955
00:31:39,440 --> 00:31:41,600
the traffic cop which is you know point

956
00:31:41,600 --> 00:31:43,840
out uh when the team voices a process or

957
00:31:43,840 --> 00:31:45,679
working agreement

958
00:31:45,679 --> 00:31:47,919
suggest relative relevant new processes

959
00:31:47,919 --> 00:31:49,600
or working agreements articulate the

960
00:31:49,600 --> 00:31:51,120
current task

961
00:31:51,120 --> 00:31:52,960
at hand and make it visible to the

962
00:31:52,960 --> 00:31:54,240
entire mob

963
00:31:54,240 --> 00:31:56,399
capturing design decisions and other

964
00:31:56,399 --> 00:31:57,840
technical details for the team

965
00:31:57,840 --> 00:31:59,760
this is the idea that you want to keep

966
00:31:59,760 --> 00:32:01,120
everybody kind of on track

967
00:32:01,120 --> 00:32:04,240
to maintain that flow and this one we've

968
00:32:04,240 --> 00:32:05,760
been hitting on a lot all throughout

969
00:32:05,760 --> 00:32:07,279
because it's uh

970
00:32:07,279 --> 00:32:09,360
really part and parcel with devops type

971
00:32:09,360 --> 00:32:10,720
work is the automationists

972
00:32:10,720 --> 00:32:12,840
and i think it's one of the cornerstones

973
00:32:12,840 --> 00:32:13,840
of uh

974
00:32:13,840 --> 00:32:15,279
at least my experience in mod

975
00:32:15,279 --> 00:32:16,960
programming is

976
00:32:16,960 --> 00:32:20,159
uh for me uh automating things is not my

977
00:32:20,159 --> 00:32:21,200
first thought

978
00:32:21,200 --> 00:32:23,360
so for me i'm more like hey let's keep

979
00:32:23,360 --> 00:32:24,480
the code clean let's

980
00:32:24,480 --> 00:32:26,399
you know maybe more of a sponsor maybe

981
00:32:26,399 --> 00:32:27,679
more facilitator

982
00:32:27,679 --> 00:32:29,039
but in every mob i've been on there's

983
00:32:29,039 --> 00:32:30,480
always been an automationist who's

984
00:32:30,480 --> 00:32:31,519
focused on

985
00:32:31,519 --> 00:32:33,519
hey austin you seem fine doing that

986
00:32:33,519 --> 00:32:35,600
redundant task over and over again

987
00:32:35,600 --> 00:32:37,200
but you know we can automate that and

988
00:32:37,200 --> 00:32:38,480
then you never have to do it again and

989
00:32:38,480 --> 00:32:40,640
we can move on to more valuable work

990
00:32:40,640 --> 00:32:42,000
and i've seen this again with

991
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:44,000
boilerplate code with

992
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:45,760
uh things i didn't know could be

993
00:32:45,760 --> 00:32:47,679
automated as far as uh

994
00:32:47,679 --> 00:32:50,480
in the pipeline and continuous delivery

995
00:32:50,480 --> 00:32:50,960
and

996
00:32:50,960 --> 00:32:52,960
uh it's just been a phenomenal

997
00:32:52,960 --> 00:32:54,080
experience mobbing with

998
00:32:54,080 --> 00:32:56,559
these type people um yeah and uh

999
00:32:56,559 --> 00:32:58,880
recently we had uh zach rogers on uh

1000
00:32:58,880 --> 00:33:01,760
the uh the show and we talked about

1001
00:33:01,760 --> 00:33:03,840
devops mobbing and modding with devops

1002
00:33:03,840 --> 00:33:04,480
and

1003
00:33:04,480 --> 00:33:07,200
and learning um and so maybe austin you

1004
00:33:07,200 --> 00:33:09,039
can talk a little bit about this one too

1005
00:33:09,039 --> 00:33:11,919
yeah so i got to mob with zach and he uh

1006
00:33:11,919 --> 00:33:14,000
was new to software development and

1007
00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:17,440
uh new to uh continuous delivery and all

1008
00:33:17,440 --> 00:33:19,440
these things and so he joined our mob

1009
00:33:19,440 --> 00:33:21,519
and it was just really fun to see his

1010
00:33:21,519 --> 00:33:23,840
journey because uh he really latched on

1011
00:33:23,840 --> 00:33:24,720
to

1012
00:33:24,720 --> 00:33:27,919
devops type concepts and he went from

1013
00:33:27,919 --> 00:33:29,279
you know just being a driver and

1014
00:33:29,279 --> 00:33:31,360
learning uh how to do it and navi

1015
00:33:31,360 --> 00:33:32,880
starting to navigate in our mob

1016
00:33:32,880 --> 00:33:34,640
to now where he's more of a devops

1017
00:33:34,640 --> 00:33:36,240
champion in the in our

1018
00:33:36,240 --> 00:33:38,720
organization and he's just you know

1019
00:33:38,720 --> 00:33:40,080
sharing about it learning about all the

1020
00:33:40,080 --> 00:33:40,480
time

1021
00:33:40,480 --> 00:33:42,799
hosting little workshops on it it's just

1022
00:33:42,799 --> 00:33:44,720
fun to see mobbing help that grow

1023
00:33:44,720 --> 00:33:47,760
nice um so kind of moving back into a

1024
00:33:47,760 --> 00:33:48,880
little bit into the meta

1025
00:33:48,880 --> 00:33:52,080
space uh mobs for me have uh

1026
00:33:52,080 --> 00:33:53,840
this was another visitor had talked

1027
00:33:53,840 --> 00:33:55,360
about the steamroller effect and this is

1028
00:33:55,360 --> 00:33:57,360
the idea that nothing gets in a mob's

1029
00:33:57,360 --> 00:33:58,240
way

1030
00:33:58,240 --> 00:34:01,360
i've seen when working alone that

1031
00:34:01,360 --> 00:34:03,519
there will be times where myself or my

1032
00:34:03,519 --> 00:34:05,440
teammates would just get stuck for long

1033
00:34:05,440 --> 00:34:06,799
periods of time

1034
00:34:06,799 --> 00:34:09,520
and we would we would always see it like

1035
00:34:09,520 --> 00:34:11,440
oh why is it still taking that long and

1036
00:34:11,440 --> 00:34:12,000
it would be

1037
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:13,440
weeks before they asked for help because

1038
00:34:13,440 --> 00:34:15,280
there was a disincentive to ask for help

1039
00:34:15,280 --> 00:34:16,159
one

1040
00:34:16,159 --> 00:34:17,679
they they were worried that they

1041
00:34:17,679 --> 00:34:19,520
wouldn't get their stuff done and

1042
00:34:19,520 --> 00:34:22,719
to uh they the people that they were

1043
00:34:22,719 --> 00:34:23,679
asking for help

1044
00:34:23,679 --> 00:34:25,839
also were wearing the same thing and so

1045
00:34:25,839 --> 00:34:27,440
it was a really big deal somebody went

1046
00:34:27,440 --> 00:34:28,480
and helped you

1047
00:34:28,480 --> 00:34:31,440
in a mob you have four brains multiple

1048
00:34:31,440 --> 00:34:33,119
brains there to do those things and

1049
00:34:33,119 --> 00:34:37,040
nothing gets him all right so it looks

1050
00:34:37,040 --> 00:34:38,239
like we lost chris

1051
00:34:38,239 --> 00:34:40,239
but uh i'll keep rolling here hopefully

1052
00:34:40,239 --> 00:34:42,079
he'll come back online and bring the

1053
00:34:42,079 --> 00:34:43,040
slides

1054
00:34:43,040 --> 00:34:46,000
uh let me pull him up uh to my left so i

1055
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:47,359
can at least

1056
00:34:47,359 --> 00:34:49,520
start hitting some of the points so the

1057
00:34:49,520 --> 00:34:50,399
next one was

1058
00:34:50,399 --> 00:34:54,079
uh kindness consideration and respect

1059
00:34:54,079 --> 00:34:56,399
so as you'll as you would think you get

1060
00:34:56,399 --> 00:34:58,640
everyone mobbing together

1061
00:34:58,640 --> 00:35:00,400
everyone in the same space whether it's

1062
00:35:00,400 --> 00:35:02,400
remotely or in person and

1063
00:35:02,400 --> 00:35:04,160
interpersonal issues will probably start

1064
00:35:04,160 --> 00:35:05,839
to occur

1065
00:35:05,839 --> 00:35:08,480
and so a cornerstone of mobbing and

1066
00:35:08,480 --> 00:35:09,440
working together well

1067
00:35:09,440 --> 00:35:11,599
is kindness consideration respect and

1068
00:35:11,599 --> 00:35:13,119
this came out of one of the original mob

1069
00:35:13,119 --> 00:35:13,680
pro

1070
00:35:13,680 --> 00:35:15,680
programming teams is they said hey what

1071
00:35:15,680 --> 00:35:17,440
things do we value and what things do we

1072
00:35:17,440 --> 00:35:19,040
want to turn up the good

1073
00:35:19,040 --> 00:35:21,839
and kindness consideration respect uh

1074
00:35:21,839 --> 00:35:22,160
where

1075
00:35:22,160 --> 00:35:25,280
those top three things and uh

1076
00:35:25,280 --> 00:35:27,119
and it's really a ladder that helps you

1077
00:35:27,119 --> 00:35:30,000
build on to the next uh

1078
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:32,960
great things and that also includes uh

1079
00:35:32,960 --> 00:35:34,720
psychological safety

1080
00:35:34,720 --> 00:35:37,520
and so uh you know so chris is pulling

1081
00:35:37,520 --> 00:35:37,839
up

1082
00:35:37,839 --> 00:35:40,000
the slide here on psychological safety

1083
00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:41,359
and what psychological safety is and

1084
00:35:41,359 --> 00:35:42,560
there's a great book

1085
00:35:42,560 --> 00:35:44,880
many great books on it uh but it's the

1086
00:35:44,880 --> 00:35:46,000
idea to

1087
00:35:46,000 --> 00:35:48,240
articulate uh raise an issue or say what

1088
00:35:48,240 --> 00:35:49,440
you're thinking and be your real

1089
00:35:49,440 --> 00:35:51,760
true self and not hold back and bring

1090
00:35:51,760 --> 00:35:54,000
your full ideas to the mob

1091
00:35:54,000 --> 00:35:55,440
and uh look all right great we've got

1092
00:35:55,440 --> 00:35:56,880
the slides back up and did you want to

1093
00:35:56,880 --> 00:35:58,960
add anything on uh psychological safety

1094
00:35:58,960 --> 00:36:01,200
chris

1095
00:36:01,200 --> 00:36:04,720
oh he's also working on his audio so um

1096
00:36:04,720 --> 00:36:08,320
yeah so we did a recently did a a

1097
00:36:08,320 --> 00:36:10,800
book group on psychological safety it's

1098
00:36:10,800 --> 00:36:12,800
called the fearless organization

1099
00:36:12,800 --> 00:36:15,040
excellent book i highly recommend it it

1100
00:36:15,040 --> 00:36:16,400
talks about ways to

1101
00:36:16,400 --> 00:36:18,000
build towards psychological safety and

1102
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:19,760
one is being vulnerable about what you

1103
00:36:19,760 --> 00:36:20,720
don't know

1104
00:36:20,720 --> 00:36:22,800
and so that will inspire others to also

1105
00:36:22,800 --> 00:36:25,040
be vulnerable about what they don't know

1106
00:36:25,040 --> 00:36:28,000
and uh you know you you start by

1107
00:36:28,000 --> 00:36:29,920
assuming psychological safety and start

1108
00:36:29,920 --> 00:36:32,000
by sharing your ideas

1109
00:36:32,000 --> 00:36:34,400
uh so the next slide is that you can't

1110
00:36:34,400 --> 00:36:36,480
see is the tier change model

1111
00:36:36,480 --> 00:36:40,880
and the satire change model is uh

1112
00:36:40,880 --> 00:36:43,599
it's basically a way to think about how

1113
00:36:43,599 --> 00:36:44,160
teams

1114
00:36:44,160 --> 00:36:47,440
uh handle change and uh you'll see

1115
00:36:47,440 --> 00:36:50,560
this uh uh happen a lot in mob

1116
00:36:50,560 --> 00:36:51,920
programming probably in a much more

1117
00:36:51,920 --> 00:36:53,440
amplified way than when teams are

1118
00:36:53,440 --> 00:36:54,000
working

1119
00:36:54,000 --> 00:36:56,160
differently in cubicles or more isolated

1120
00:36:56,160 --> 00:36:57,680
and you have your status quo the way

1121
00:36:57,680 --> 00:36:58,720
things are working

1122
00:36:58,720 --> 00:37:00,800
someone new joins the team or a new idea

1123
00:37:00,800 --> 00:37:02,800
comes in and so there's this time

1124
00:37:02,800 --> 00:37:05,040
where the team kind of goes through

1125
00:37:05,040 --> 00:37:06,720
chaos

1126
00:37:06,720 --> 00:37:08,960
and it's totally natural uh it's gonna

1127
00:37:08,960 --> 00:37:10,320
happen with teams

1128
00:37:10,320 --> 00:37:12,079
and uh you get then you have a

1129
00:37:12,079 --> 00:37:13,520
transforming idea

1130
00:37:13,520 --> 00:37:14,720
and then you're able to integrate and

1131
00:37:14,720 --> 00:37:16,640
then kind of establish your new status

1132
00:37:16,640 --> 00:37:18,560
quo at a higher performing rate

1133
00:37:18,560 --> 00:37:21,440
and uh the thing is is you can't avoid

1134
00:37:21,440 --> 00:37:23,520
the satire change model from happening

1135
00:37:23,520 --> 00:37:26,000
but what you can do is get really good

1136
00:37:26,000 --> 00:37:27,119
at going through this

1137
00:37:27,119 --> 00:37:28,880
so we're going to be doing a workshop

1138
00:37:28,880 --> 00:37:30,960
later today where people are going to be

1139
00:37:30,960 --> 00:37:32,480
mob programmers people they never have

1140
00:37:32,480 --> 00:37:35,040
before and so when this

1141
00:37:35,040 --> 00:37:36,800
uh occurs it's good to know about this

1142
00:37:36,800 --> 00:37:38,320
model to say hey yes we're gonna go

1143
00:37:38,320 --> 00:37:39,440
through chaos

1144
00:37:39,440 --> 00:37:40,720
uh with mobbing it's gonna be a little

1145
00:37:40,720 --> 00:37:42,800
more amplified but we getting we're

1146
00:37:42,800 --> 00:37:43,920
gonna get good at

1147
00:37:43,920 --> 00:37:45,359
figuring out how to get out of it and

1148
00:37:45,359 --> 00:37:47,599
reach our new status quo

1149
00:37:47,599 --> 00:37:50,240
and uh the next slide after that while

1150
00:37:50,240 --> 00:37:51,359
chris is trying to bring that back

1151
00:37:51,359 --> 00:37:53,359
online is transparency metrics and

1152
00:37:53,359 --> 00:37:54,720
consistency

1153
00:37:54,720 --> 00:37:56,880
and uh so one thing another kind of meta

1154
00:37:56,880 --> 00:37:58,160
thing is

1155
00:37:58,160 --> 00:38:01,280
you know how do you uh measure uh mobs

1156
00:38:01,280 --> 00:38:02,560
and teams working this way

1157
00:38:02,560 --> 00:38:04,880
and just sharing from experience i've

1158
00:38:04,880 --> 00:38:07,599
seen a lot of anti-patterns with metrics

1159
00:38:07,599 --> 00:38:12,079
um but it is good to be transparent to

1160
00:38:12,079 --> 00:38:14,480
the other organizations um or your

1161
00:38:14,480 --> 00:38:16,400
customers whoever you're working with

1162
00:38:16,400 --> 00:38:18,079
and instead of measuring the internals

1163
00:38:18,079 --> 00:38:19,359
of the system you try to measure the

1164
00:38:19,359 --> 00:38:20,400
outcomes

1165
00:38:20,400 --> 00:38:22,480
and while it's not it's much harder to

1166
00:38:22,480 --> 00:38:23,839
measure the outcomes

1167
00:38:23,839 --> 00:38:26,000
uh one thing that's worked really well

1168
00:38:26,000 --> 00:38:28,000
for us is measurement

1169
00:38:28,000 --> 00:38:29,440
yes you're back all right it's good to

1170
00:38:29,440 --> 00:38:30,720
have you back all right everybody that

1171
00:38:30,720 --> 00:38:32,000
was really odd i don't know what

1172
00:38:32,000 --> 00:38:32,960
happened but let's

1173
00:38:32,960 --> 00:38:36,160
let's keep it up yes so you can skip uh

1174
00:38:36,160 --> 00:38:37,280
satire change

1175
00:38:37,280 --> 00:38:39,599
and uh why don't you talk about this one

1176
00:38:39,599 --> 00:38:40,960
chris a little bit more all right sounds

1177
00:38:40,960 --> 00:38:42,320
good sorry about that everybody

1178
00:38:42,320 --> 00:38:44,560
um so transparency metrics and

1179
00:38:44,560 --> 00:38:45,839
consistency so this is another thing

1180
00:38:45,839 --> 00:38:46,240
where

1181
00:38:46,240 --> 00:38:48,240
um you know just being in the leadership

1182
00:38:48,240 --> 00:38:49,839
role i have to explain mob programming

1183
00:38:49,839 --> 00:38:51,440
and the efficiencies a lot

1184
00:38:51,440 --> 00:38:54,880
um one thing that we use as

1185
00:38:54,880 --> 00:38:56,640
metrics key metrics key performance

1186
00:38:56,640 --> 00:38:59,280
indicators is this idea of

1187
00:38:59,280 --> 00:39:02,320
essentially using release frequency and

1188
00:39:02,320 --> 00:39:03,520
zero bugs

1189
00:39:03,520 --> 00:39:06,640
and then you know bugs being kind of

1190
00:39:06,640 --> 00:39:08,160
anything that surprises a human or

1191
00:39:08,160 --> 00:39:09,520
something along those lines

1192
00:39:09,520 --> 00:39:13,040
and so keeping bug counts low or at zero

1193
00:39:13,040 --> 00:39:15,839
and then also uh basically showing

1194
00:39:15,839 --> 00:39:17,280
metrics around release frequency

1195
00:39:17,280 --> 00:39:19,119
this stuff is much more important in my

1196
00:39:19,119 --> 00:39:20,320
opinion than say

1197
00:39:20,320 --> 00:39:23,359
velocity or anything along those lines

1198
00:39:23,359 --> 00:39:25,760
and uh and so just kind of outcome

1199
00:39:25,760 --> 00:39:28,240
driven i know devops talks a lot about

1200
00:39:28,240 --> 00:39:29,119
that um

1201
00:39:29,119 --> 00:39:31,440
and and so it's pretty interesting and

1202
00:39:31,440 --> 00:39:32,800
maybe austin can talk a little bit about

1203
00:39:32,800 --> 00:39:35,920
my slide from japan here

1204
00:39:36,160 --> 00:39:37,839
yeah so diffusion of innovation is a

1205
00:39:37,839 --> 00:39:39,839
great concept that has to do with

1206
00:39:39,839 --> 00:39:42,880
uh how innovative ideas start and how

1207
00:39:42,880 --> 00:39:43,839
they kind of

1208
00:39:43,839 --> 00:39:46,640
uh move through the system right and

1209
00:39:46,640 --> 00:39:47,440
it's a good

1210
00:39:47,440 --> 00:39:49,920
concept to have in mind because uh

1211
00:39:49,920 --> 00:39:51,359
change doesn't happen overnight there's

1212
00:39:51,359 --> 00:39:52,800
often stages of innovators early

1213
00:39:52,800 --> 00:39:54,480
adopters and then you got to cross this

1214
00:39:54,480 --> 00:39:55,599
big chasm

1215
00:39:55,599 --> 00:39:57,599
an early majority late majority and i've

1216
00:39:57,599 --> 00:39:58,640
seen this happen

1217
00:39:58,640 --> 00:40:00,960
uh really well with uh devops and

1218
00:40:00,960 --> 00:40:03,359
mobbing i think really helps amplify

1219
00:40:03,359 --> 00:40:05,680
uh the change but it's also good to

1220
00:40:05,680 --> 00:40:07,599
model to keep in mind because you you're

1221
00:40:07,599 --> 00:40:08,800
as you're thinking about like hey it'd

1222
00:40:08,800 --> 00:40:10,960
be great if we had automation and my

1223
00:40:10,960 --> 00:40:13,200
current team or mob is not open to it

1224
00:40:13,200 --> 00:40:14,720
you're looking to find your early

1225
00:40:14,720 --> 00:40:16,160
adopters or innovators who are willing

1226
00:40:16,160 --> 00:40:17,040
to try it out

1227
00:40:17,040 --> 00:40:19,119
and pour into those people and give them

1228
00:40:19,119 --> 00:40:21,280
the space and time they need

1229
00:40:21,280 --> 00:40:24,319
to grow the skills and then once the

1230
00:40:24,319 --> 00:40:25,040
early

1231
00:40:25,040 --> 00:40:26,960
early majority sees it working well for

1232
00:40:26,960 --> 00:40:29,119
those people then it has a chance to

1233
00:40:29,119 --> 00:40:30,240
cross the chasm

1234
00:40:30,240 --> 00:40:31,760
so it's just a great organizational

1235
00:40:31,760 --> 00:40:34,160
change tool uh to keep in mind

1236
00:40:34,160 --> 00:40:36,079
when you're trying to bring devops

1237
00:40:36,079 --> 00:40:37,599
concepts to your teams

1238
00:40:37,599 --> 00:40:39,280
and i've found it to work really well

1239
00:40:39,280 --> 00:40:40,960
with mobbing

1240
00:40:40,960 --> 00:40:43,920
and nice to see that the uh the practice

1241
00:40:43,920 --> 00:40:45,520
of mobbing across the pacific and not

1242
00:40:45,520 --> 00:40:48,319
only the chasm

1243
00:40:48,960 --> 00:40:53,280
oh that's why you had yes

1244
00:40:53,280 --> 00:40:56,400
is all around the world uh done in in

1245
00:40:56,400 --> 00:40:58,960
you know europe japan and many many

1246
00:40:58,960 --> 00:41:00,800
other places and so it's been fun to see

1247
00:41:00,800 --> 00:41:01,599
it grow

1248
00:41:01,599 --> 00:41:03,680
uh but it started just in a few places

1249
00:41:03,680 --> 00:41:07,839
with some early adopters and innovators

1250
00:41:07,839 --> 00:41:12,079
and so uh uh upcoming next will be

1251
00:41:12,079 --> 00:41:14,880
uh learning right yes so you wanna talk

1252
00:41:14,880 --> 00:41:15,280
about that

1253
00:41:15,280 --> 00:41:17,440
chris oh yeah learning has a competitive

1254
00:41:17,440 --> 00:41:18,880
advantage so um

1255
00:41:18,880 --> 00:41:22,400
this is the idea uh um richard sheridan

1256
00:41:22,400 --> 00:41:23,599
has a book joy inc

1257
00:41:23,599 --> 00:41:25,920
and uh he talks a lot about this concept

1258
00:41:25,920 --> 00:41:26,800
but um

1259
00:41:26,800 --> 00:41:30,160
any any team a lot of the time it's

1260
00:41:30,160 --> 00:41:31,680
you know in the technology world

1261
00:41:31,680 --> 00:41:34,079
especially it's how quickly can you

1262
00:41:34,079 --> 00:41:34,560
pivot

1263
00:41:34,560 --> 00:41:36,720
um and and what's what's nice about this

1264
00:41:36,720 --> 00:41:38,560
picture here actually is that

1265
00:41:38,560 --> 00:41:41,200
this is this was a kind of dedicated

1266
00:41:41,200 --> 00:41:43,200
devops team that was formed for a while

1267
00:41:43,200 --> 00:41:44,720
that was devops

1268
00:41:44,720 --> 00:41:47,440
uh security and development uh there

1269
00:41:47,440 --> 00:41:50,079
with with their core interests and so

1270
00:41:50,079 --> 00:41:51,520
um that was that was a pretty cool

1271
00:41:51,520 --> 00:41:53,280
picture when i found it but learning as

1272
00:41:53,280 --> 00:41:54,880
a competitive advantage is basically

1273
00:41:54,880 --> 00:41:57,040
you know how quickly can you learn

1274
00:41:57,040 --> 00:41:59,440
something to then automate those 120

1275
00:41:59,440 --> 00:42:01,040
steps like we talked about in that story

1276
00:42:01,040 --> 00:42:02,000
before

1277
00:42:02,000 --> 00:42:05,040
uh this idea that if we never sat down

1278
00:42:05,040 --> 00:42:06,960
to learn that technology we'd still be

1279
00:42:06,960 --> 00:42:08,960
doing those 120 steps every time we were

1280
00:42:08,960 --> 00:42:09,599
released

1281
00:42:09,599 --> 00:42:11,359
how likely would it have been that we

1282
00:42:11,359 --> 00:42:12,960
would have been doing daily releases if

1283
00:42:12,960 --> 00:42:14,480
we had to do 120

1284
00:42:14,480 --> 00:42:16,800
steps that we had to remember every time

1285
00:42:16,800 --> 00:42:18,400
every time we released

1286
00:42:18,400 --> 00:42:21,119
and uh so it's really important to keep

1287
00:42:21,119 --> 00:42:21,680
in mind

1288
00:42:21,680 --> 00:42:24,880
that um there there's definitely

1289
00:42:24,880 --> 00:42:28,079
a need for uh essentially continuous

1290
00:42:28,079 --> 00:42:28,960
learning

1291
00:42:28,960 --> 00:42:32,480
and uh and overcoming those things

1292
00:42:32,480 --> 00:42:33,760
especially to strike

1293
00:42:33,760 --> 00:42:37,280
flow efficiency for a team it's

1294
00:42:37,280 --> 00:42:39,359
the the main roadblocks is going to be

1295
00:42:39,359 --> 00:42:41,040
everything that the team doesn't know

1296
00:42:41,040 --> 00:42:41,359
yet

1297
00:42:41,359 --> 00:42:44,480
and so the speed at which you do

1298
00:42:44,480 --> 00:42:46,400
development is going to be directly tied

1299
00:42:46,400 --> 00:42:49,920
to how quickly you can remove known and

1300
00:42:49,920 --> 00:42:50,560
unknown

1301
00:42:50,560 --> 00:42:53,839
unknowns for the development process and

1302
00:42:53,839 --> 00:42:55,760
this includes devops

1303
00:42:55,760 --> 00:42:58,960
as well and so it is really important

1304
00:42:58,960 --> 00:43:01,760
to consider learning and having

1305
00:43:01,760 --> 00:43:03,520
dedicated learning time

1306
00:43:03,520 --> 00:43:05,680
and things along those lines to keep

1307
00:43:05,680 --> 00:43:07,119
that competitive advantage

1308
00:43:07,119 --> 00:43:10,880
alive and well

1309
00:43:11,280 --> 00:43:13,440
yeah and one thing that uh one thing i

1310
00:43:13,440 --> 00:43:14,800
learned about uh

1311
00:43:14,800 --> 00:43:16,960
that is great to have learning time for

1312
00:43:16,960 --> 00:43:18,720
is uh technical debt and i'm sure we've

1313
00:43:18,720 --> 00:43:19,040
all

1314
00:43:19,040 --> 00:43:20,960
experienced it and one thing that really

1315
00:43:20,960 --> 00:43:22,400
jumps out to me with technical

1316
00:43:22,400 --> 00:43:24,560
devops is something called the scout

1317
00:43:24,560 --> 00:43:26,480
rule uh it comes from

1318
00:43:26,480 --> 00:43:28,560
bob martin book clean code is at least

1319
00:43:28,560 --> 00:43:29,760
one place comes from

1320
00:43:29,760 --> 00:43:31,359
but it also applies to devops and the

1321
00:43:31,359 --> 00:43:33,119
idea is you always leave the camp

1322
00:43:33,119 --> 00:43:35,359
campground nicer than when you found it

1323
00:43:35,359 --> 00:43:37,200
or the code or the pipeline right

1324
00:43:37,200 --> 00:43:39,040
and so yeah i'm sure in any of your

1325
00:43:39,040 --> 00:43:40,800
processes and i know in mine

1326
00:43:40,800 --> 00:43:42,240
there's all these things we want to make

1327
00:43:42,240 --> 00:43:43,839
better right and so every time we're

1328
00:43:43,839 --> 00:43:45,200
doing something manual

1329
00:43:45,200 --> 00:43:46,880
instead of like stop everything we're

1330
00:43:46,880 --> 00:43:48,160
not going to develop any more features

1331
00:43:48,160 --> 00:43:49,119
until we

1332
00:43:49,119 --> 00:43:51,119
clean up all our technical debt you can

1333
00:43:51,119 --> 00:43:52,960
scout it right and you can say okay

1334
00:43:52,960 --> 00:43:55,920
it's 120 manual steps let's eliminate

1335
00:43:55,920 --> 00:43:57,440
the first five

1336
00:43:57,440 --> 00:43:59,200
uh and automate those and then we'll

1337
00:43:59,200 --> 00:44:01,280
finish on completing our card right

1338
00:44:01,280 --> 00:44:02,640
and so you can chip away at that

1339
00:44:02,640 --> 00:44:04,400
technical debt

1340
00:44:04,400 --> 00:44:07,040
um another thing that is uh really

1341
00:44:07,040 --> 00:44:08,079
important about

1342
00:44:08,079 --> 00:44:10,560
mobbing and just mobbing uh rules is

1343
00:44:10,560 --> 00:44:11,280
like

1344
00:44:11,280 --> 00:44:13,920
um people are people criticize mobbing

1345
00:44:13,920 --> 00:44:15,359
sometimes saying like okay well what if

1346
00:44:15,359 --> 00:44:16,880
somebody's bored or on their phone or

1347
00:44:16,880 --> 00:44:18,160
something along those lines

1348
00:44:18,160 --> 00:44:19,760
we maintain this idea of the law of

1349
00:44:19,760 --> 00:44:21,599
personal mobility

1350
00:44:21,599 --> 00:44:23,920
or the law of two feet from the uh from

1351
00:44:23,920 --> 00:44:25,119
the open spaces

1352
00:44:25,119 --> 00:44:26,480
and and if you haven't been to an open

1353
00:44:26,480 --> 00:44:28,000
space conference i highly recommend

1354
00:44:28,000 --> 00:44:29,359
going and there should be hopefully a

1355
00:44:29,359 --> 00:44:30,560
lot of online ones

1356
00:44:30,560 --> 00:44:33,599
starting up soon but um this idea that

1357
00:44:33,599 --> 00:44:34,880
if you're not contributing

1358
00:44:34,880 --> 00:44:36,880
and you're not learning then you should

1359
00:44:36,880 --> 00:44:38,400
go to a different mob

1360
00:44:38,400 --> 00:44:41,680
and uh and even recently

1361
00:44:41,680 --> 00:44:44,400
uh when a team was kind of moving too

1362
00:44:44,400 --> 00:44:45,040
fast

1363
00:44:45,040 --> 00:44:47,119
or something along those lines um

1364
00:44:47,119 --> 00:44:48,720
somebody basically said hey i'm gonna go

1365
00:44:48,720 --> 00:44:49,839
because i'm not learning and i'm not

1366
00:44:49,839 --> 00:44:51,280
contributing and it's like it was a good

1367
00:44:51,280 --> 00:44:52,640
retrospective point to say

1368
00:44:52,640 --> 00:44:54,000
well wait a minute why are you not

1369
00:44:54,000 --> 00:44:56,079
learning and not contributing and we

1370
00:44:56,079 --> 00:44:57,520
actually talked about it and they ended

1371
00:44:57,520 --> 00:44:58,880
up not leaving but it was

1372
00:44:58,880 --> 00:45:01,359
it was a really uh a really eye-opening

1373
00:45:01,359 --> 00:45:03,119
moment it's because we have that rule

1374
00:45:03,119 --> 00:45:05,280
that let us do that

1375
00:45:05,280 --> 00:45:07,839
yeah and uh you know often emergency is

1376
00:45:07,839 --> 00:45:09,359
a catalyst for good changes

1377
00:45:09,359 --> 00:45:11,760
um you know there's been several times

1378
00:45:11,760 --> 00:45:12,640
in my life

1379
00:45:12,640 --> 00:45:14,720
where you know bad things have happened

1380
00:45:14,720 --> 00:45:15,760
and it's

1381
00:45:15,760 --> 00:45:17,520
motivated me to try something different

1382
00:45:17,520 --> 00:45:19,680
and mobbing was part of that and

1383
00:45:19,680 --> 00:45:22,240
uh so some of my first experiences were

1384
00:45:22,240 --> 00:45:24,079
coming out of bad experiences and that

1385
00:45:24,079 --> 00:45:25,520
led to full-time mobbing

1386
00:45:25,520 --> 00:45:27,839
and leading to great changes uh chris

1387
00:45:27,839 --> 00:45:28,640
you have any

1388
00:45:28,640 --> 00:45:30,720
things to add i mean so so all through

1389
00:45:30,720 --> 00:45:32,480
my life as well this has been

1390
00:45:32,480 --> 00:45:34,800
the case so when i started doing no

1391
00:45:34,800 --> 00:45:36,400
estimates that's when the military had

1392
00:45:36,400 --> 00:45:38,079
an emergency and we couldn't estimate we

1393
00:45:38,079 --> 00:45:39,280
just had to deliver

1394
00:45:39,280 --> 00:45:40,800
when i started doing mobbing we had an

1395
00:45:40,800 --> 00:45:42,400
emergency and we did we needed

1396
00:45:42,400 --> 00:45:46,240
to be able to release uh something

1397
00:45:46,240 --> 00:45:48,560
quickly and get past hurdles and and we

1398
00:45:48,560 --> 00:45:49,599
did that

1399
00:45:49,599 --> 00:45:51,440
um when we started scaling the team

1400
00:45:51,440 --> 00:45:53,200
there was an emergency and we had to

1401
00:45:53,200 --> 00:45:54,800
start scaling the team because of that

1402
00:45:54,800 --> 00:45:55,920
emergency

1403
00:45:55,920 --> 00:45:58,240
and uh and we'll talk about a little bit

1404
00:45:58,240 --> 00:45:58,960
later but

1405
00:45:58,960 --> 00:46:01,280
even code 19 is changing a lot for us

1406
00:46:01,280 --> 00:46:03,040
and and we'll talk about

1407
00:46:03,040 --> 00:46:05,280
those changes and how you can turn those

1408
00:46:05,280 --> 00:46:08,240
things positive later

1409
00:46:08,240 --> 00:46:10,720
yeah and uh please continue on this one

1410
00:46:10,720 --> 00:46:11,440
as well yeah

1411
00:46:11,440 --> 00:46:15,040
yeah okay sorry um the uh

1412
00:46:15,040 --> 00:46:18,400
this slide um so there is a

1413
00:46:18,400 --> 00:46:21,440
uh a talk um basically about

1414
00:46:21,440 --> 00:46:24,079
uh being okay with failure and uh

1415
00:46:24,079 --> 00:46:25,839
comparing two pottery classes

1416
00:46:25,839 --> 00:46:28,000
one pottery class that is told that the

1417
00:46:28,000 --> 00:46:29,680
best pot at the end of the semester is

1418
00:46:29,680 --> 00:46:30,720
going to be

1419
00:46:30,720 --> 00:46:33,839
uh the one that we use and the

1420
00:46:33,839 --> 00:46:36,480
uh and the other one was just told that

1421
00:46:36,480 --> 00:46:37,599
they're gonna weigh their work

1422
00:46:37,599 --> 00:46:39,040
over the course of the semester that

1423
00:46:39,040 --> 00:46:41,200
picture was from my dad who also does

1424
00:46:41,200 --> 00:46:43,200
pottery and he has beautiful work but

1425
00:46:43,200 --> 00:46:44,160
it's because he made hundreds of

1426
00:46:44,160 --> 00:46:45,359
thousands of pots not just

1427
00:46:45,359 --> 00:46:47,359
trying to make the perfect one um so

1428
00:46:47,359 --> 00:46:48,800
check that out

1429
00:46:48,800 --> 00:46:50,400
yeah and uh one thing is about the

1430
00:46:50,400 --> 00:46:52,160
virtuous loop is having retrospectives

1431
00:46:52,160 --> 00:46:52,560
and

1432
00:46:52,560 --> 00:46:54,000
it's not only turning up the good but

1433
00:46:54,000 --> 00:46:55,760
also bad things right so we would keep

1434
00:46:55,760 --> 00:46:56,160
our

1435
00:46:56,160 --> 00:46:58,640
uh you know we'd run retrospectives

1436
00:46:58,640 --> 00:47:00,079
multiple times throughout the day small

1437
00:47:00,079 --> 00:47:00,720
ones

1438
00:47:00,720 --> 00:47:02,480
and we look through like hey here are

1439
00:47:02,480 --> 00:47:04,079
things we said we were gonna try or do

1440
00:47:04,079 --> 00:47:05,280
how are those going

1441
00:47:05,280 --> 00:47:08,000
should we stop trying this uh this is

1442
00:47:08,000 --> 00:47:10,160
not working for us and so to check in

1443
00:47:10,160 --> 00:47:12,640
using those retrospectives and in your

1444
00:47:12,640 --> 00:47:14,319
mobs or in your teams and saying

1445
00:47:14,319 --> 00:47:15,599
hey what things are we doing that we

1446
00:47:15,599 --> 00:47:17,920
should stop doing and so

1447
00:47:17,920 --> 00:47:20,319
basically for any experiment you run you

1448
00:47:20,319 --> 00:47:21,839
want to be able to see when it fails so

1449
00:47:21,839 --> 00:47:22,960
you can stop

1450
00:47:22,960 --> 00:47:25,280
yeah and so one thing that that might

1451
00:47:25,280 --> 00:47:26,000
lead into

1452
00:47:26,000 --> 00:47:28,400
is his estimation really providing value

1453
00:47:28,400 --> 00:47:29,119
to you

1454
00:47:29,119 --> 00:47:31,599
um i talk about this a lot in general in

1455
00:47:31,599 --> 00:47:33,200
other locations but um

1456
00:47:33,200 --> 00:47:35,359
and you can go and see a blog of mine

1457
00:47:35,359 --> 00:47:36,960
called the software estimation paradox

1458
00:47:36,960 --> 00:47:37,520
but

1459
00:47:37,520 --> 00:47:39,280
if we are paying people to automate

1460
00:47:39,280 --> 00:47:40,720
things um

1461
00:47:40,720 --> 00:47:43,359
and you you basically can only estimate

1462
00:47:43,359 --> 00:47:45,119
well things that you have done many

1463
00:47:45,119 --> 00:47:46,480
times before

1464
00:47:46,480 --> 00:47:48,480
then devops engineers and software

1465
00:47:48,480 --> 00:47:50,720
engineers we would be paying the

1466
00:47:50,720 --> 00:47:52,640
by estimate having them estimate we'd be

1467
00:47:52,640 --> 00:47:54,400
paying them to get good

1468
00:47:54,400 --> 00:47:57,040
at estimating uh or incentivizing in

1469
00:47:57,040 --> 00:47:57,839
some way

1470
00:47:57,839 --> 00:48:00,240
uh therefore why would we pay somebody

1471
00:48:00,240 --> 00:48:01,359
uh to

1472
00:48:01,359 --> 00:48:04,160
um to basically be doing something and

1473
00:48:04,160 --> 00:48:05,520
not automating it

1474
00:48:05,520 --> 00:48:08,880
and so because automation is a part of

1475
00:48:08,880 --> 00:48:10,640
our world every day

1476
00:48:10,640 --> 00:48:13,119
estimation is diametrically opposed to

1477
00:48:13,119 --> 00:48:14,800
that

1478
00:48:14,800 --> 00:48:17,280
yeah and uh now that your blood pressure

1479
00:48:17,280 --> 00:48:20,319
is higher about hearing no estimates

1480
00:48:20,319 --> 00:48:23,520
uh one thing we uh that helps uh

1481
00:48:23,520 --> 00:48:25,359
you know teams and mobs try out new

1482
00:48:25,359 --> 00:48:27,119
things are things called lofty goals and

1483
00:48:27,119 --> 00:48:27,760
so

1484
00:48:27,760 --> 00:48:30,800
these are things we aspire to and uh we

1485
00:48:30,800 --> 00:48:33,040
will do lean coffees and retrospectives

1486
00:48:33,040 --> 00:48:34,720
on these ideas

1487
00:48:34,720 --> 00:48:36,880
and in relation to devops one of them is

1488
00:48:36,880 --> 00:48:38,000
uh no one

1489
00:48:38,000 --> 00:48:41,200
uh between uh us and production right

1490
00:48:41,200 --> 00:48:42,000
and so

1491
00:48:42,000 --> 00:48:44,319
uh with any mob you have at least two

1492
00:48:44,319 --> 00:48:45,520
pairs of eyes

1493
00:48:45,520 --> 00:48:48,640
on the code and that means uh

1494
00:48:48,640 --> 00:48:52,960
you have a live qa live code review

1495
00:48:52,960 --> 00:48:54,640
and we should be able to go all the way

1496
00:48:54,640 --> 00:48:56,000
to production um

1497
00:48:56,000 --> 00:48:58,960
as often and as frequently as we can and

1498
00:48:58,960 --> 00:49:00,079
you know to be honest

1499
00:49:00,079 --> 00:49:02,079
our you know teams i've been on always

1500
00:49:02,079 --> 00:49:03,200
been there but it's great to have the

1501
00:49:03,200 --> 00:49:05,280
lofty goals to retrospect on and say hey

1502
00:49:05,280 --> 00:49:07,040
how can we get there how can we be

1503
00:49:07,040 --> 00:49:09,200
delivering frequently and that that

1504
00:49:09,200 --> 00:49:10,800
quote i think came from yahoo which is

1505
00:49:10,800 --> 00:49:12,640
no one between code and production

1506
00:49:12,640 --> 00:49:15,920
um and we we adopted that and and it's

1507
00:49:15,920 --> 00:49:17,599
been very useful for us

1508
00:49:17,599 --> 00:49:20,000
um i'm going to go back to the idea of

1509
00:49:20,000 --> 00:49:20,720
emergencies

1510
00:49:20,720 --> 00:49:22,720
leading to change just because we have

1511
00:49:22,720 --> 00:49:24,640
this relevant topic right now

1512
00:49:24,640 --> 00:49:27,520
it's this idea of um basically you know

1513
00:49:27,520 --> 00:49:28,800
covet 19's around

1514
00:49:28,800 --> 00:49:31,119
and we were basically you know had no

1515
00:49:31,119 --> 00:49:32,480
remote at all

1516
00:49:32,480 --> 00:49:34,559
and then we were kicked to being all

1517
00:49:34,559 --> 00:49:36,160
remote and so you'll notice from the

1518
00:49:36,160 --> 00:49:37,359
screens here

1519
00:49:37,359 --> 00:49:39,440
we have mobbers we have code we have the

1520
00:49:39,440 --> 00:49:40,720
kanban

1521
00:49:40,720 --> 00:49:43,200
we have our different setups here and so

1522
00:49:43,200 --> 00:49:45,200
yet again another emergency has led us

1523
00:49:45,200 --> 00:49:46,160
to remote mob

1524
00:49:46,160 --> 00:49:49,119
programming and the concepts there and

1525
00:49:49,119 --> 00:49:49,680
so

1526
00:49:49,680 --> 00:49:51,280
uh we wanted to talk a little bit about

1527
00:49:51,280 --> 00:49:53,119
that transition

1528
00:49:53,119 --> 00:49:56,400
yeah and uh i haven't done remote

1529
00:49:56,400 --> 00:49:58,000
uh work well i actually have done some

1530
00:49:58,000 --> 00:50:00,240
remote work uh without mob programming

1531
00:50:00,240 --> 00:50:02,640
and i've also been doing full-time so we

1532
00:50:02,640 --> 00:50:04,319
transitioned from full-time in-person

1533
00:50:04,319 --> 00:50:06,240
mob programming to full-time remote mod

1534
00:50:06,240 --> 00:50:07,040
programming

1535
00:50:07,040 --> 00:50:09,920
and it's been fascinating to feel the

1536
00:50:09,920 --> 00:50:11,839
experience and then talk with others who

1537
00:50:11,839 --> 00:50:13,520
aren't having that and so

1538
00:50:13,520 --> 00:50:15,839
with full-time remote mod programming

1539
00:50:15,839 --> 00:50:17,599
it's been incredible i mean the

1540
00:50:17,599 --> 00:50:19,760
interaction and the fun and the

1541
00:50:19,760 --> 00:50:20,960
productivity

1542
00:50:20,960 --> 00:50:22,800
has stayed through remote we just have

1543
00:50:22,800 --> 00:50:24,559
the video chat on all day

1544
00:50:24,559 --> 00:50:26,480
and it really helps with the isolation

1545
00:50:26,480 --> 00:50:28,000
problem and other people i've talked to

1546
00:50:28,000 --> 00:50:30,319
who have had to switch to full remote

1547
00:50:30,319 --> 00:50:32,319
is it's been emotionally a struggle and

1548
00:50:32,319 --> 00:50:33,599
i really like the quote

1549
00:50:33,599 --> 00:50:36,720
um from remote remote mob programming

1550
00:50:36,720 --> 00:50:38,240
dot org and it's that

1551
00:50:38,240 --> 00:50:40,000
with remote mod programming you're home

1552
00:50:40,000 --> 00:50:42,319
but you're never alone

1553
00:50:42,319 --> 00:50:44,319
and i'll just say i'll just attack on to

1554
00:50:44,319 --> 00:50:45,839
that that um

1555
00:50:45,839 --> 00:50:47,520
you know you can see our environment

1556
00:50:47,520 --> 00:50:49,280
here in the past and

1557
00:50:49,280 --> 00:50:51,760
uh you know everybody's in person at

1558
00:50:51,760 --> 00:50:52,720
large screens

1559
00:50:52,720 --> 00:50:54,880
and you're you know so this would be

1560
00:50:54,880 --> 00:50:56,160
like politically incorrect

1561
00:50:56,160 --> 00:50:59,359
to organize like this today right um and

1562
00:50:59,359 --> 00:51:00,000
so

1563
00:51:00,000 --> 00:51:02,720
uh you know what's interesting is that

1564
00:51:02,720 --> 00:51:04,240
uh since going remote

1565
00:51:04,240 --> 00:51:06,319
um i've been talking to people all day

1566
00:51:06,319 --> 00:51:08,640
every day i've been joining remote mobs

1567
00:51:08,640 --> 00:51:09,599
i

1568
00:51:09,599 --> 00:51:12,720
i have an abundance of social

1569
00:51:12,720 --> 00:51:13,520
interaction

1570
00:51:13,520 --> 00:51:17,280
during my work day um and and it's very

1571
00:51:17,280 --> 00:51:20,960
uh so going from from this to remote

1572
00:51:20,960 --> 00:51:23,520
has actually been a fairly light

1573
00:51:23,520 --> 00:51:24,640
transition

1574
00:51:24,640 --> 00:51:28,000
um where i think that uh it's

1575
00:51:28,000 --> 00:51:30,400
it's a little bit uh different for the

1576
00:51:30,400 --> 00:51:31,920
people that are experiencing for

1577
00:51:31,920 --> 00:51:35,680
this for the first time um

1578
00:51:35,680 --> 00:51:38,160
yeah and uh you know one one aspect to

1579
00:51:38,160 --> 00:51:39,839
uh switching to remote

1580
00:51:39,839 --> 00:51:42,880
is uh you know commute time so we've

1581
00:51:42,880 --> 00:51:45,520
seen it before that uh many you know

1582
00:51:45,520 --> 00:51:46,800
many have loved the mob programming

1583
00:51:46,800 --> 00:51:47,520
environments

1584
00:51:47,520 --> 00:51:48,880
but to all get together in the same

1585
00:51:48,880 --> 00:51:50,640
building some people have to commute

1586
00:51:50,640 --> 00:51:52,079
quite a ways because their roots are in

1587
00:51:52,079 --> 00:51:53,680
farther away places from the particular

1588
00:51:53,680 --> 00:51:54,720
building

1589
00:51:54,720 --> 00:51:57,440
and so one great thing about remote is a

1590
00:51:57,440 --> 00:51:59,440
lot of those pains went away

1591
00:51:59,440 --> 00:52:01,599
but yet people were still able to to get

1592
00:52:01,599 --> 00:52:04,079
together and remote mob program

1593
00:52:04,079 --> 00:52:06,640
and uh so this kind of you know leads to

1594
00:52:06,640 --> 00:52:08,240
maybe the sponsorship role in mob

1595
00:52:08,240 --> 00:52:09,280
programming or

1596
00:52:09,280 --> 00:52:11,520
uh kind of development joy is that when

1597
00:52:11,520 --> 00:52:12,480
you're working with people all day

1598
00:52:12,480 --> 00:52:14,160
together you're being kind considered

1599
00:52:14,160 --> 00:52:14,960
respectful

1600
00:52:14,960 --> 00:52:16,720
uh you can start having fun you know so

1601
00:52:16,720 --> 00:52:18,000
uh i think alex

1602
00:52:18,000 --> 00:52:19,920
here is wearing uh my christmas gift to

1603
00:52:19,920 --> 00:52:21,119
him and

1604
00:52:21,119 --> 00:52:25,359
uh yeah another efficiency that we saw

1605
00:52:25,359 --> 00:52:27,119
um it's kind of been a weird thing and

1606
00:52:27,119 --> 00:52:28,559
it uh is that

1607
00:52:28,559 --> 00:52:30,079
in the past we realized that our product

1608
00:52:30,079 --> 00:52:31,920
owner relationships directly dependent

1609
00:52:31,920 --> 00:52:33,760
on how and often we saw them

1610
00:52:33,760 --> 00:52:35,200
and so when going to remote i was

1611
00:52:35,200 --> 00:52:36,800
expecting to see a reduction of

1612
00:52:36,800 --> 00:52:38,319
efficiency because

1613
00:52:38,319 --> 00:52:41,119
um our product owners basically didn't

1614
00:52:41,119 --> 00:52:41,599
uh

1615
00:52:41,599 --> 00:52:44,720
you know they i was worried that

1616
00:52:44,720 --> 00:52:46,400
less interaction because we're remote

1617
00:52:46,400 --> 00:52:48,079
would be harder on us

1618
00:52:48,079 --> 00:52:49,920
um but what was interesting is that the

1619
00:52:49,920 --> 00:52:51,680
product owners uh a lot of times were in

1620
00:52:51,680 --> 00:52:52,480
other buildings

1621
00:52:52,480 --> 00:52:55,440
and so we saw the exact opposite effect

1622
00:52:55,440 --> 00:52:56,720
once we removed

1623
00:52:56,720 --> 00:52:59,280
the the actual barrier of walking from

1624
00:52:59,280 --> 00:53:00,000
their desk

1625
00:53:00,000 --> 00:53:03,760
to ours we saw them a lot more and so

1626
00:53:03,760 --> 00:53:06,640
we actually uh observed many new

1627
00:53:06,640 --> 00:53:08,000
efficiencies

1628
00:53:08,000 --> 00:53:10,160
around this which has been a really

1629
00:53:10,160 --> 00:53:11,040
strong

1630
00:53:11,040 --> 00:53:14,640
thing yeah and so just to

1631
00:53:14,640 --> 00:53:17,520
uh rapid fire share some tools that

1632
00:53:17,520 --> 00:53:18,880
we've helped if you want to experiment

1633
00:53:18,880 --> 00:53:19,920
with the

1634
00:53:19,920 --> 00:53:22,319
devops remote remote mob programming uh

1635
00:53:22,319 --> 00:53:23,040
so

1636
00:53:23,040 --> 00:53:24,880
uh one kind of in relation to the

1637
00:53:24,880 --> 00:53:27,280
product owners is uh having trello

1638
00:53:27,280 --> 00:53:30,960
or uh microsoft teams a planner board

1639
00:53:30,960 --> 00:53:32,400
which is basically a virtual kanban

1640
00:53:32,400 --> 00:53:33,760
board and share that with your product

1641
00:53:33,760 --> 00:53:34,319
owner

1642
00:53:34,319 --> 00:53:36,319
uh for me i've seen any desk work really

1643
00:53:36,319 --> 00:53:38,240
well teams video chat

1644
00:53:38,240 --> 00:53:40,960
uh and those are some of the tools that

1645
00:53:40,960 --> 00:53:43,040
occur to me how about you chris

1646
00:53:43,040 --> 00:53:46,400
yeah um so i really like just anything

1647
00:53:46,400 --> 00:53:47,920
like any desk so like team viewer as

1648
00:53:47,920 --> 00:53:48,319
well

1649
00:53:48,319 --> 00:53:49,839
basically multiple people controlling

1650
00:53:49,839 --> 00:53:51,440
the same machine i'll just

1651
00:53:51,440 --> 00:53:52,800
talk about the physical setup a little

1652
00:53:52,800 --> 00:53:54,559
bit which was really cool is that we

1653
00:53:54,559 --> 00:53:56,480
have all of our mobbing stations which

1654
00:53:56,480 --> 00:53:58,079
are pretty beefy computers

1655
00:53:58,079 --> 00:54:00,559
and uh they're kind of on site and we're

1656
00:54:00,559 --> 00:54:02,319
remoting into them and so everybody

1657
00:54:02,319 --> 00:54:03,839
being remote to that one machine has

1658
00:54:03,839 --> 00:54:05,280
been a really good thing

1659
00:54:05,280 --> 00:54:07,839
um you know slack-like systems microsoft

1660
00:54:07,839 --> 00:54:08,559
teams has a

1661
00:54:08,559 --> 00:54:10,319
cool feature as well of the the

1662
00:54:10,319 --> 00:54:11,599
basically being able to jump into

1663
00:54:11,599 --> 00:54:13,119
channels that have video chats

1664
00:54:13,119 --> 00:54:14,559
and so it's like walking around the

1665
00:54:14,559 --> 00:54:16,960
office has very little to do

1666
00:54:16,960 --> 00:54:18,960
mind mapping tools drawing tools are

1667
00:54:18,960 --> 00:54:20,800
also really great communication

1668
00:54:20,800 --> 00:54:24,480
systems um so i think we're pretty close

1669
00:54:24,480 --> 00:54:25,119
to

1670
00:54:25,119 --> 00:54:27,599
the time where we answer q a um so if

1671
00:54:27,599 --> 00:54:29,119
you have questions start queuing them up

1672
00:54:29,119 --> 00:54:29,680
but

1673
00:54:29,680 --> 00:54:31,520
uh maybe you can outro us austin while

1674
00:54:31,520 --> 00:54:33,440
we do that yeah so while you're queuing

1675
00:54:33,440 --> 00:54:35,040
up your questions uh we just want to say

1676
00:54:35,040 --> 00:54:35,520
thank you

1677
00:54:35,520 --> 00:54:38,160
this was a phenomenal opportunity uh we

1678
00:54:38,160 --> 00:54:39,599
love sharing about our experiences with

1679
00:54:39,599 --> 00:54:40,880
mod programming

1680
00:54:40,880 --> 00:54:42,480
if you want to hear more you can reach

1681
00:54:42,480 --> 00:54:44,319
out to us on youtube twitter

1682
00:54:44,319 --> 00:54:47,440
podcast and so on

1683
00:54:47,440 --> 00:54:49,760
on twitter it's mob underscore

1684
00:54:49,760 --> 00:54:51,359
underscore mentality

1685
00:54:51,359 --> 00:54:54,480
and we have uh you know over

1686
00:54:54,480 --> 00:54:56,720
50 videos on all these top many of the

1687
00:54:56,720 --> 00:54:58,480
topics we've covered today

1688
00:54:58,480 --> 00:55:01,119
we interview people from uh all around

1689
00:55:01,119 --> 00:55:02,559
the world who are doing mob programming

1690
00:55:02,559 --> 00:55:04,160
and remote mob programming

1691
00:55:04,160 --> 00:55:06,240
and they get to share their experiences

1692
00:55:06,240 --> 00:55:07,520
and what's working well and what's not

1693
00:55:07,520 --> 00:55:09,040
working for well for them

1694
00:55:09,040 --> 00:55:11,359
um and you'll see many times in these

1695
00:55:11,359 --> 00:55:12,960
episodes we also talk about

1696
00:55:12,960 --> 00:55:14,480
devops and how it relates to mob

1697
00:55:14,480 --> 00:55:16,960
programming and with that i guess i'll

1698
00:55:16,960 --> 00:55:19,280
i'll kick it over to the host to

1699
00:55:19,280 --> 00:55:21,280
facilitate the q a

1700
00:55:21,280 --> 00:55:24,000
right so we do have a couple minutes and

1701
00:55:24,000 --> 00:55:25,760
a couple questions so i'm going to start

1702
00:55:25,760 --> 00:55:27,359
with the last one so

1703
00:55:27,359 --> 00:55:30,079
um in practice how many mobbing hours a

1704
00:55:30,079 --> 00:55:31,520
day seems to work right now

1705
00:55:31,520 --> 00:55:34,640
during the lockdown how well does it uh

1706
00:55:34,640 --> 00:55:37,440
work to just leave the zoom online um

1707
00:55:37,440 --> 00:55:38,240
all day and

1708
00:55:38,240 --> 00:55:40,960
try to do mopping work yeah so um we're

1709
00:55:40,960 --> 00:55:42,720
using microsoft teams for communication

1710
00:55:42,720 --> 00:55:44,079
but this works for zoom as well the

1711
00:55:44,079 --> 00:55:45,359
workshop we're going to be doing that

1712
00:55:45,359 --> 00:55:46,240
with but

1713
00:55:46,240 --> 00:55:49,440
um we we mob for seven hours a day

1714
00:55:49,440 --> 00:55:50,960
and then we have an hour of learning

1715
00:55:50,960 --> 00:55:52,960
session and so um

1716
00:55:52,960 --> 00:55:55,040
but this has been the case even before

1717
00:55:55,040 --> 00:55:56,880
we were remote so for the last eight

1718
00:55:56,880 --> 00:55:57,920
years

1719
00:55:57,920 --> 00:56:01,040
um i have either been part of mobs or

1720
00:56:01,040 --> 00:56:03,680
managing mobs

1721
00:56:03,680 --> 00:56:05,839
that have been mobbing for seven hours a

1722
00:56:05,839 --> 00:56:07,200
day

1723
00:56:07,200 --> 00:56:08,720
and so woody zoell was the manager for

1724
00:56:08,720 --> 00:56:10,480
about the first four years and then i

1725
00:56:10,480 --> 00:56:10,960
started

1726
00:56:10,960 --> 00:56:14,079
managing it when he left wow that's

1727
00:56:14,079 --> 00:56:17,119
impressive so i'm sorry i'm sure

1728
00:56:17,119 --> 00:56:19,280
we can find more resources on on your

1729
00:56:19,280 --> 00:56:20,720
videos in terms of

1730
00:56:20,720 --> 00:56:23,599
mobbing um another question was does

1731
00:56:23,599 --> 00:56:25,520
everyone have to be at the same level of

1732
00:56:25,520 --> 00:56:27,040
knowledge to make it work and i think

1733
00:56:27,040 --> 00:56:27,920
you kind of

1734
00:56:27,920 --> 00:56:29,520
referred to it um during the

1735
00:56:29,520 --> 00:56:31,040
presentation but

1736
00:56:31,040 --> 00:56:33,680
um you know someone has different levels

1737
00:56:33,680 --> 00:56:36,160
seniors juniors tech leads on the team

1738
00:56:36,160 --> 00:56:38,880
how how do they make work yeah so a lot

1739
00:56:38,880 --> 00:56:39,280
of it

1740
00:56:39,280 --> 00:56:41,920
is so i think it's actually the opposite

1741
00:56:41,920 --> 00:56:43,520
the best way to do it is to have a

1742
00:56:43,520 --> 00:56:44,079
gradient

1743
00:56:44,079 --> 00:56:46,559
of knowledge so and we talk a lot about

1744
00:56:46,559 --> 00:56:47,599
if you're not learning and not

1745
00:56:47,599 --> 00:56:50,079
contributing then choose a different mob

1746
00:56:50,079 --> 00:56:53,599
um and so learning is definitely a good

1747
00:56:53,599 --> 00:56:55,040
activity especially for

1748
00:56:55,040 --> 00:56:57,280
de-siloing and bringing people up to

1749
00:56:57,280 --> 00:56:58,160
speed

1750
00:56:58,160 --> 00:57:00,960
um most of our developers we we don't

1751
00:57:00,960 --> 00:57:01,680
have any

1752
00:57:01,680 --> 00:57:03,680
uh device set up for them when they

1753
00:57:03,680 --> 00:57:05,359
first join us so many teams will have

1754
00:57:05,359 --> 00:57:07,520
like a two week to six month ramp up

1755
00:57:07,520 --> 00:57:08,799
time for a developer

1756
00:57:08,799 --> 00:57:10,079
a developer in our environment can

1757
00:57:10,079 --> 00:57:12,079
become productive within the first few

1758
00:57:12,079 --> 00:57:13,760
hours that they're there

1759
00:57:13,760 --> 00:57:16,559
and um and so what we see a lot of times

1760
00:57:16,559 --> 00:57:17,359
is our

1761
00:57:17,359 --> 00:57:20,799
most junior people end up starting and

1762
00:57:20,799 --> 00:57:22,960
creating unexpected contributions to the

1763
00:57:22,960 --> 00:57:24,079
code um

1764
00:57:24,079 --> 00:57:25,680
so the big piece of that is that the

1765
00:57:25,680 --> 00:57:27,119
senior developers have to table their

1766
00:57:27,119 --> 00:57:29,040
ego

1767
00:57:29,040 --> 00:57:32,640
so yeah yeah um so i think this is one

1768
00:57:32,640 --> 00:57:32,960
of

1769
00:57:32,960 --> 00:57:35,359
there's a couple of questions so uh

1770
00:57:35,359 --> 00:57:36,559
comments from people

1771
00:57:36,559 --> 00:57:38,160
saying that they've tried it and it was

1772
00:57:38,160 --> 00:57:39,760
amazing um

1773
00:57:39,760 --> 00:57:42,319
but also there's one last question about

1774
00:57:42,319 --> 00:57:43,200
um

1775
00:57:43,200 --> 00:57:46,400
is it a must-have uh sorry um is it

1776
00:57:46,400 --> 00:57:48,319
better approach to do mob programming

1777
00:57:48,319 --> 00:57:50,720
instead of pair programming by default

1778
00:57:50,720 --> 00:57:54,079
um how is it better all so i i

1779
00:57:54,079 --> 00:57:55,760
have opinions on this but like the first

1780
00:57:55,760 --> 00:57:57,520
thing is that we're just going back to

1781
00:57:57,520 --> 00:57:59,040
the just sharing slide

1782
00:57:59,040 --> 00:58:00,960
and and maybe our episode on just

1783
00:58:00,960 --> 00:58:03,280
sharing is this idea that we're

1784
00:58:03,280 --> 00:58:05,440
we're giving you ideas for experiments

1785
00:58:05,440 --> 00:58:07,200
to try in your environment

1786
00:58:07,200 --> 00:58:10,160
and it may or may not work for you um

1787
00:58:10,160 --> 00:58:12,240
now now my personal opinion is is that

1788
00:58:12,240 --> 00:58:13,119
when we go down

1789
00:58:13,119 --> 00:58:17,119
smaller from a mob of of more people

1790
00:58:17,119 --> 00:58:20,559
what i see is that the the tasks that we

1791
00:58:20,559 --> 00:58:21,119
work on

1792
00:58:21,119 --> 00:58:24,559
are typically more simple and so

1793
00:58:24,559 --> 00:58:27,520
an example of this is that once as a mob

1794
00:58:27,520 --> 00:58:29,200
we were working on another project that

1795
00:58:29,200 --> 00:58:30,880
we didn't have any decision making power

1796
00:58:30,880 --> 00:58:31,599
on

1797
00:58:31,599 --> 00:58:34,319
and the tasks we were working on were so

1798
00:58:34,319 --> 00:58:35,920
simple we wanted to automate them but

1799
00:58:35,920 --> 00:58:36,480
couldn't

1800
00:58:36,480 --> 00:58:38,799
so then we decided to work individually

1801
00:58:38,799 --> 00:58:41,359
on the project instead of mobbing

1802
00:58:41,359 --> 00:58:43,440
and so this pattern is pretty pretty

1803
00:58:43,440 --> 00:58:46,079
common if you feel like the tasks are

1804
00:58:46,079 --> 00:58:47,760
too simple to mob on

1805
00:58:47,760 --> 00:58:49,280
it probably means that you should have

1806
00:58:49,280 --> 00:58:51,200
automated it a long time ago

1807
00:58:51,200 --> 00:58:54,400
um and uh and so so uh

1808
00:58:54,400 --> 00:58:56,720
if you find yourself breaking away from

1809
00:58:56,720 --> 00:58:57,520
mobbing

1810
00:58:57,520 --> 00:59:00,960
um my suggestion is is to ask everyone

1811
00:59:00,960 --> 00:59:01,920
could we automate

1812
00:59:01,920 --> 00:59:04,640
these tasks instead of breaking up as a

1813
00:59:04,640 --> 00:59:07,040
mob so we never have to do them again

1814
00:59:07,040 --> 00:59:08,559
we have a couple more questions that

1815
00:59:08,559 --> 00:59:10,160
just came in so one is

1816
00:59:10,160 --> 00:59:13,119
how do you um facilitate remote mobiles

1817
00:59:13,119 --> 00:59:13,920
with different

1818
00:59:13,920 --> 00:59:15,920
schedules so for instance having

1819
00:59:15,920 --> 00:59:18,799
different time zones yeah so uh we're

1820
00:59:18,799 --> 00:59:20,079
currently on

1821
00:59:20,079 --> 00:59:23,359
all on the same time zone um i've seen

1822
00:59:23,359 --> 00:59:25,920
you know so uh at the height of

1823
00:59:25,920 --> 00:59:27,680
performance i i'd say like

1824
00:59:27,680 --> 00:59:30,319
a truly effective mob typically releases

1825
00:59:30,319 --> 00:59:30,880
every

1826
00:59:30,880 --> 00:59:33,680
um you know four hours or less to

1827
00:59:33,680 --> 00:59:34,640
production

1828
00:59:34,640 --> 00:59:38,000
and so um what what i typically will end

1829
00:59:38,000 --> 00:59:38,720
up seeing

1830
00:59:38,720 --> 00:59:41,200
uh or suggesting in those cases is if

1831
00:59:41,200 --> 00:59:43,440
you can find four hours of overlap

1832
00:59:43,440 --> 00:59:45,040
then you probably can have a good

1833
00:59:45,040 --> 00:59:47,280
productive mobbing session happen

1834
00:59:47,280 --> 00:59:48,880
and if you're yeah and so these are all

1835
00:59:48,880 --> 00:59:50,880
just experiments i would run i don't

1836
00:59:50,880 --> 00:59:51,440
have

1837
00:59:51,440 --> 00:59:54,160
the mobbers in other time zones right

1838
00:59:54,160 --> 00:59:54,799
now

1839
00:59:54,799 --> 00:59:56,720
but if you have four hours of overlap

1840
00:59:56,720 --> 00:59:58,480
try and capitalize as much as you can on

1841
00:59:58,480 --> 00:59:59,680
that four hours

1842
00:59:59,680 --> 01:00:02,079
and then um that would allow you to give

1843
01:00:02,079 --> 01:00:04,319
knowledge transfer to other teams and so

1844
01:00:04,319 --> 01:00:06,480
you might have two people from one time

1845
01:00:06,480 --> 01:00:07,839
zone and two people from another time

1846
01:00:07,839 --> 01:00:09,280
zone mobbed together

1847
01:00:09,280 --> 01:00:11,680
and then the two people that sign off

1848
01:00:11,680 --> 01:00:13,920
may then get another two people in the

1849
01:00:13,920 --> 01:00:15,839
other time zone to mob with those two

1850
01:00:15,839 --> 01:00:16,480
people

1851
01:00:16,480 --> 01:00:18,000
now you get this kind of temporal

1852
01:00:18,000 --> 01:00:20,319
transition of information as you go

1853
01:00:20,319 --> 01:00:22,240
and i think that that could be really

1854
01:00:22,240 --> 01:00:23,520
effective for

1855
01:00:23,520 --> 01:00:26,319
uh multiple time zone development cool

1856
01:00:26,319 --> 01:00:28,000
one last question is um is

1857
01:00:28,000 --> 01:00:31,040
mobbing different than swarming um

1858
01:00:31,040 --> 01:00:33,359
yeah so i would say that swarm the idea

1859
01:00:33,359 --> 01:00:34,079
of swarming

1860
01:00:34,079 --> 01:00:36,400
is that you are working on your own

1861
01:00:36,400 --> 01:00:37,760
stuff for a while and then you get

1862
01:00:37,760 --> 01:00:40,319
together in a war room and then swarm

1863
01:00:40,319 --> 01:00:42,400
um mobbing i think is a fundamentally

1864
01:00:42,400 --> 01:00:43,599
different concept you're kind of going

1865
01:00:43,599 --> 01:00:44,480
in with the agreement that you're going

1866
01:00:44,480 --> 01:00:46,240
to work like this all day every day

1867
01:00:46,240 --> 01:00:49,440
and only break apart uh briefly

1868
01:00:49,440 --> 01:00:52,480
in certain situations and so uh swarming

1869
01:00:52,480 --> 01:00:53,839
is where

1870
01:00:53,839 --> 01:00:56,240
everybody gets together as the exception

1871
01:00:56,240 --> 01:00:57,200
and mobbing

1872
01:00:57,200 --> 01:00:59,040
is everybody splits apart as the

1873
01:00:59,040 --> 01:01:00,880
exception

1874
01:01:00,880 --> 01:01:04,240
gotcha okay well i'm i think we're at

1875
01:01:04,240 --> 01:01:08,000
