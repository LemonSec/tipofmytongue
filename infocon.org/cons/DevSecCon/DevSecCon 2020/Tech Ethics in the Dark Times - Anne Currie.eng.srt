1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:08,240
and our next speaker is any curry so

2
00:00:08,240 --> 00:00:13,620
sure is you're all yours and hi oh right

3
00:00:13,620 --> 00:00:15,690
well I will need to share my screaming

4
00:00:15,690 --> 00:00:21,810
time okay just quickly let me do that

5
00:00:21,810 --> 00:00:27,260
you'll be able to see my slides okay

6
00:00:27,260 --> 00:00:31,380
right and I'll put them into present

7
00:00:31,380 --> 00:00:35,280
mode excellent

8
00:00:35,280 --> 00:00:40,290
so um my name is AB curry and I have

9
00:00:40,290 --> 00:00:44,309
been in the tech industry for 25 years

10
00:00:44,309 --> 00:00:49,950
now as an engineer and also as a I was

11
00:00:49,950 --> 00:00:51,420
involved in putting quite a few startups

12
00:00:51,420 --> 00:00:53,640
these days I am a science fiction writer

13
00:00:53,640 --> 00:00:57,270
and I also am a lecturer in technics at

14
00:00:57,270 --> 00:00:59,129
the University of Hartford just north of

15
00:00:59,129 --> 00:00:59,699
London

16
00:00:59,699 --> 00:01:03,180
and when I normally do I'm involved in a

17
00:01:03,180 --> 00:01:04,589
lot of conferences I organize a lot of

18
00:01:04,589 --> 00:01:06,689
conferences and I talk a lot at

19
00:01:06,689 --> 00:01:08,729
conferences about all the terrible

20
00:01:08,729 --> 00:01:11,159
things that Tech is doing and ethical

21
00:01:11,159 --> 00:01:12,450
behavior and what kind of stuff I'm

22
00:01:12,450 --> 00:01:14,340
actually going to do something a little

23
00:01:14,340 --> 00:01:16,890
different today because I think it's

24
00:01:16,890 --> 00:01:19,049
what you would talk about in terms of

25
00:01:19,049 --> 00:01:22,590
tech ethics in the good times and what

26
00:01:22,590 --> 00:01:25,080
might be necessary in the dark times are

27
00:01:25,080 --> 00:01:27,509
quite different and right now we are in

28
00:01:27,509 --> 00:01:29,820
the middle of an event a very serious

29
00:01:29,820 --> 00:01:31,049
event in which an awful lot of people

30
00:01:31,049 --> 00:01:33,990
die and that changes our perspective

31
00:01:33,990 --> 00:01:36,509
about what is the right thing to do with

32
00:01:36,509 --> 00:01:38,579
tech how we should use it the stakes

33
00:01:38,579 --> 00:01:41,689
have changed our perspective has changed

34
00:01:41,689 --> 00:01:44,369
so in this talk I'm going to do

35
00:01:44,369 --> 00:01:46,170
something a little bit odd which is I'm

36
00:01:46,170 --> 00:01:48,420
going to use the slides that I would

37
00:01:48,420 --> 00:01:50,970
have used to slag off a whole load of

38
00:01:50,970 --> 00:01:52,680
things that are going on in tech and

39
00:01:52,680 --> 00:01:55,290
instead use those those same slides to

40
00:01:55,290 --> 00:01:58,890
talk about how those technologies can be

41
00:01:58,890 --> 00:02:03,210
or are being used positively to combat

42
00:02:03,210 --> 00:02:07,409
the corona virus and even where they

43
00:02:07,409 --> 00:02:09,568
used being used positively we do have to

44
00:02:09,568 --> 00:02:11,459
think about it there are downsides to

45
00:02:11,459 --> 00:02:13,140
them as well as upsides so

46
00:02:13,140 --> 00:02:15,300
I'm singing their praises is fantastic

47
00:02:15,300 --> 00:02:16,590
good that we're using technology in the

48
00:02:16,590 --> 00:02:18,630
way we are but we also need to be a

49
00:02:18,630 --> 00:02:19,980
little bit difficult a little bit

50
00:02:19,980 --> 00:02:22,200
careful about it we need to remember

51
00:02:22,200 --> 00:02:23,790
that there are downsides to these

52
00:02:23,790 --> 00:02:25,800
technologies as well as the astonishing

53
00:02:25,800 --> 00:02:28,920
upsides that we're seeing right now so

54
00:02:28,920 --> 00:02:31,440
so why is it why is it that I'm having

55
00:02:31,440 --> 00:02:33,870
to give a different talk well it's

56
00:02:33,870 --> 00:02:37,620
because right now Humanity is at war

57
00:02:37,620 --> 00:02:41,780
with an implacable other this is not a

58
00:02:41,780 --> 00:02:45,239
competitor this is not a another country

59
00:02:45,239 --> 00:02:46,709
difficult as it would be if we were in

60
00:02:46,709 --> 00:02:49,080
competition with another country this is

61
00:02:49,080 --> 00:02:52,320
a virus it's something that essentially

62
00:02:52,320 --> 00:02:54,989
doesn't care about us it doesn't it

63
00:02:54,989 --> 00:02:56,790
doesn't want to kill us it's merely a

64
00:02:56,790 --> 00:02:59,310
side effect that we that large numbers

65
00:02:59,310 --> 00:03:03,900
of us will die if this virus if this

66
00:03:03,900 --> 00:03:06,660
virus continues if it spreads if it

67
00:03:06,660 --> 00:03:09,450
reproduces itself and therefore our

68
00:03:09,450 --> 00:03:12,030
primary goal at the moment is to stop it

69
00:03:12,030 --> 00:03:15,090
doing that and to maintain society while

70
00:03:15,090 --> 00:03:18,540
we do so so we need to save lives and we

71
00:03:18,540 --> 00:03:19,920
need to protect the society that we're

72
00:03:19,920 --> 00:03:23,160
in and that takes precedence that is now

73
00:03:23,160 --> 00:03:27,000
our number one goal and that changes how

74
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:28,680
we might be using technology and how we

75
00:03:28,680 --> 00:03:31,380
might perceive it and it really does

76
00:03:31,380 --> 00:03:32,760
change what's going to happen in the

77
00:03:32,760 --> 00:03:35,430
future because this is going to go on

78
00:03:35,430 --> 00:03:39,870
for a year two years and all work in

79
00:03:39,870 --> 00:03:42,239
psychology suggests that anything that

80
00:03:42,239 --> 00:03:44,489
happens over confer over an extended

81
00:03:44,489 --> 00:03:45,120
period of time

82
00:03:45,120 --> 00:03:47,190
we get used to it it's called

83
00:03:47,190 --> 00:03:49,380
habituation and it will be very

84
00:03:49,380 --> 00:03:51,150
difficult for us to turn off some of the

85
00:03:51,150 --> 00:03:53,070
behaviors that we've put in place now in

86
00:03:53,070 --> 00:03:55,920
two years time we might not want to it

87
00:03:55,920 --> 00:03:59,010
but that the situation is the reality is

88
00:03:59,010 --> 00:04:01,350
that it may just not occur to us to do

89
00:04:01,350 --> 00:04:03,810
so so we are going to have to make some

90
00:04:03,810 --> 00:04:05,400
difficult decisions now and remember

91
00:04:05,400 --> 00:04:08,280
that we did because in two years time it

92
00:04:08,280 --> 00:04:10,230
will just seem normal but maybe we don't

93
00:04:10,230 --> 00:04:13,590
want to stay that way so if we look at

94
00:04:13,590 --> 00:04:16,140
some of the very successful uses of

95
00:04:16,140 --> 00:04:18,539
technology in battling the corona virus

96
00:04:18,539 --> 00:04:20,370
we really need to look at Asia because

97
00:04:20,370 --> 00:04:22,260
they started early and they've also done

98
00:04:22,260 --> 00:04:24,060
some fantastic work if

99
00:04:24,060 --> 00:04:28,470
China they are using what I've certainly

100
00:04:28,470 --> 00:04:30,240
six months would have ago would have

101
00:04:30,240 --> 00:04:33,150
described as astonishingly dystopian

102
00:04:33,150 --> 00:04:35,750
technology but they're using it to save

103
00:04:35,750 --> 00:04:38,250
probably millions of their own lives you

104
00:04:38,250 --> 00:04:40,980
know certainly millions of lives within

105
00:04:40,980 --> 00:04:43,730
China they're using very heavy-handed

106
00:04:43,730 --> 00:04:46,680
surveillance mass surveillance so for

107
00:04:46,680 --> 00:04:50,100
example drones are hovering walk during

108
00:04:50,100 --> 00:04:52,680
lockdown were hovering over cities in

109
00:04:52,680 --> 00:04:56,040
China measuring people's temperatures

110
00:04:56,040 --> 00:04:58,139
identifying people who might be at risk

111
00:04:58,139 --> 00:05:00,540
of having but while spreading her own a

112
00:05:00,540 --> 00:05:02,280
virus using the facial recognition

113
00:05:02,280 --> 00:05:05,520
technology to identify them send the

114
00:05:05,520 --> 00:05:08,070
police to their houses to pull them out

115
00:05:08,070 --> 00:05:10,380
and put them in that compulsory

116
00:05:10,380 --> 00:05:12,870
quarantine now six months ago I would

117
00:05:12,870 --> 00:05:15,300
have described that as horrendously

118
00:05:15,300 --> 00:05:19,050
dystopian but we cannot argue that it

119
00:05:19,050 --> 00:05:22,110
didn't work it was very effective and it

120
00:05:22,110 --> 00:05:24,720
down undoubtedly saved a great deal of

121
00:05:24,720 --> 00:05:28,289
lives but it was very heavy-handed now

122
00:05:28,289 --> 00:05:32,280
there are two reasons why we might not

123
00:05:32,280 --> 00:05:35,100
want to use that approach in the West

124
00:05:35,100 --> 00:05:36,990
well this is very heavy-handed we might

125
00:05:36,990 --> 00:05:39,360
we might struggle to do it in in a

126
00:05:39,360 --> 00:05:41,640
democratic society but probably more

127
00:05:41,640 --> 00:05:44,370
importantly we couldn't do it but China

128
00:05:44,370 --> 00:05:46,979
have been spending as much on internal

129
00:05:46,979 --> 00:05:49,470
surveillance as their entire external

130
00:05:49,470 --> 00:05:52,530
defense budgets for several years now we

131
00:05:52,530 --> 00:05:54,450
just haven't we are not in that session

132
00:05:54,450 --> 00:05:57,110
although interestingly London is the

133
00:05:57,110 --> 00:06:00,389
sixth most surveilled city in the world

134
00:06:00,389 --> 00:06:03,810
almost most of the rest of the top ten

135
00:06:03,810 --> 00:06:07,289
are in China but the danger isn't isn't

136
00:06:07,289 --> 00:06:09,060
well integrated together so even if we

137
00:06:09,060 --> 00:06:12,930
wanted to use it we couldn't but there

138
00:06:12,930 --> 00:06:15,750
are other examples which are less

139
00:06:15,750 --> 00:06:17,490
heavy-handed and have been just as

140
00:06:17,490 --> 00:06:20,039
effective if we look at South Korea they

141
00:06:20,039 --> 00:06:22,110
really are the poster jar for using mass

142
00:06:22,110 --> 00:06:24,389
surveillance to control the coronavirus

143
00:06:24,389 --> 00:06:29,580
they it's well it's it's no more opt-in

144
00:06:29,580 --> 00:06:31,770
it's slightly more opt-in but they are a

145
00:06:31,770 --> 00:06:34,590
democratic country but it is much more

146
00:06:34,590 --> 00:06:37,620
public so they take data a lot of

147
00:06:37,620 --> 00:06:39,840
from phones people install apps on their

148
00:06:39,840 --> 00:06:44,160
phones a lot of it from mass testing of

149
00:06:44,160 --> 00:06:46,830
which the results are shared and the

150
00:06:46,830 --> 00:06:48,300
very interesting thing about South Korea

151
00:06:48,300 --> 00:06:51,120
versus China and versus I suspect the

152
00:06:51,120 --> 00:06:53,760
way the West will go is where that data

153
00:06:53,760 --> 00:06:58,610
goes so in China the data is often

154
00:06:58,610 --> 00:07:01,050
collected by commercial organizations

155
00:07:01,050 --> 00:07:03,419
but it goes to the government who use it

156
00:07:03,419 --> 00:07:05,310
very heavily I happen is not available

157
00:07:05,310 --> 00:07:07,860
to the ordinary citizen in South Korea

158
00:07:07,860 --> 00:07:10,520
there a lot of the data is collected by

159
00:07:10,520 --> 00:07:13,500
companies collected by the state but

160
00:07:13,500 --> 00:07:15,660
then it's published so that everyone can

161
00:07:15,660 --> 00:07:16,080
see it

162
00:07:16,080 --> 00:07:20,100
now you might say that has worse privacy

163
00:07:20,100 --> 00:07:22,350
implications but I would argue that it

164
00:07:22,350 --> 00:07:24,840
doesn't it has exactly the same privacy

165
00:07:24,840 --> 00:07:26,460
implications it's just that they're

166
00:07:26,460 --> 00:07:29,669
vastly more apparent to you

167
00:07:29,669 --> 00:07:32,220
so in South Korea if your neighbor has

168
00:07:32,220 --> 00:07:34,949
an a corona virus then you know about it

169
00:07:34,949 --> 00:07:37,710
and you can act on it it's more police

170
00:07:37,710 --> 00:07:40,830
able because you if your neighbor is

171
00:07:40,830 --> 00:07:42,780
behaving badly you can you couldn't do

172
00:07:42,780 --> 00:07:45,349
something about that which has its

173
00:07:45,349 --> 00:07:48,900
utopian and dystopian aspects to it but

174
00:07:48,900 --> 00:07:52,770
it is very clear so you know as a South

175
00:07:52,770 --> 00:07:54,720
Korean citizen that your data is being

176
00:07:54,720 --> 00:07:58,229
shared now I like that much better than

177
00:07:58,229 --> 00:08:00,830
I like the kind of pseudo fantasy

178
00:08:00,830 --> 00:08:04,680
privacy of a commercial company has the

179
00:08:04,680 --> 00:08:06,570
data which is actually already the cases

180
00:08:06,570 --> 00:08:08,280
it's very rare when we're looking at the

181
00:08:08,280 --> 00:08:10,800
West in in using mobile phone data that

182
00:08:10,800 --> 00:08:12,449
mobile phone data is already available

183
00:08:12,449 --> 00:08:16,800
to mobile phone companies so your

184
00:08:16,800 --> 00:08:18,449
privacy has already been breached you're

185
00:08:18,449 --> 00:08:19,949
just living in a little bit of a dream

186
00:08:19,949 --> 00:08:23,729
world that it hasn't been we're talking

187
00:08:23,729 --> 00:08:25,110
now about sharing that data with

188
00:08:25,110 --> 00:08:26,910
governments and that feels more

189
00:08:26,910 --> 00:08:28,410
dystopian but it isn't necessarily

190
00:08:28,410 --> 00:08:30,810
really but I like the way that South

191
00:08:30,810 --> 00:08:32,429
Korea have gone which is that it shared

192
00:08:32,429 --> 00:08:36,719
with everyone that way you it feels more

193
00:08:36,719 --> 00:08:39,120
uncomfortable but I think it is actually

194
00:08:39,120 --> 00:08:45,150
more it's it's more real you you know

195
00:08:45,150 --> 00:08:46,589
what the situation is you feel

196
00:08:46,589 --> 00:08:47,910
uncomfortable therefore you're more

197
00:08:47,910 --> 00:08:49,560
likely to turn it off later if you don't

198
00:08:49,560 --> 00:08:50,140
like it

199
00:08:50,140 --> 00:08:52,570
but if you try to choose to continue

200
00:08:52,570 --> 00:08:54,220
with it because you find it useful you

201
00:08:54,220 --> 00:08:55,600
will at least be making an informed

202
00:08:55,600 --> 00:08:58,990
decision about that I I worry that in

203
00:08:58,990 --> 00:09:02,230
the West we're going to go down the

204
00:09:02,230 --> 00:09:06,420
commercial and government routes and

205
00:09:06,420 --> 00:09:09,579
that will be so invisible to the

206
00:09:09,579 --> 00:09:12,430
populace that we won't turn it off again

207
00:09:12,430 --> 00:09:14,500
because we won't really be aware that

208
00:09:14,500 --> 00:09:17,019
it's happening I would rather that we

209
00:09:17,019 --> 00:09:19,089
were aware it's I think it's less

210
00:09:19,089 --> 00:09:21,700
infantilizing and it's potentially more

211
00:09:21,700 --> 00:09:27,370
useful so privacy but versus safety

212
00:09:27,370 --> 00:09:29,740
there's a lot more discussion to be had

213
00:09:29,740 --> 00:09:32,110
here than we currently are and I really

214
00:09:32,110 --> 00:09:33,760
would like us to be talking about who

215
00:09:33,760 --> 00:09:36,970
has that data and just because you feel

216
00:09:36,970 --> 00:09:38,380
good about it doesn't mean that actually

217
00:09:38,380 --> 00:09:40,630
it's a better situation it might be

218
00:09:40,630 --> 00:09:42,910
better for us to feel worse about it but

219
00:09:42,910 --> 00:09:47,290
be more aware so normally I'm slagging

220
00:09:47,290 --> 00:09:50,649
off drone surveillance and and mass

221
00:09:50,649 --> 00:09:52,690
surveillance in in all its forms and a

222
00:09:52,690 --> 00:09:54,640
warning about it but here it's

223
00:09:54,640 --> 00:09:57,970
undoubtedly extremely potentially useful

224
00:09:57,970 --> 00:10:00,100
for saving lives so we can't say we

225
00:10:00,100 --> 00:10:02,740
won't do it in fact we should do it we

226
00:10:02,740 --> 00:10:05,410
just need to be aware of it and do it

227
00:10:05,410 --> 00:10:09,220
deliberately so when I'm not slacking

228
00:10:09,220 --> 00:10:11,310
off mass surveillance I am often

229
00:10:11,310 --> 00:10:13,839
slacking off the even more frightening

230
00:10:13,839 --> 00:10:19,380
thing to me which is anthropomorphism it

231
00:10:19,380 --> 00:10:22,510
is an extraordinarily dangerous thing

232
00:10:22,510 --> 00:10:25,680
when it comes to robotics and AI so

233
00:10:25,680 --> 00:10:27,610
anthropomorphism is when you ascribe

234
00:10:27,610 --> 00:10:30,820
human emotions and human reactions to

235
00:10:30,820 --> 00:10:33,790
inanimate objects because they look a

236
00:10:33,790 --> 00:10:36,250
bit human or they seen a bit human and

237
00:10:36,250 --> 00:10:38,709
it's very dangerous when it comes to AI

238
00:10:38,709 --> 00:10:41,860
and robotics because anthropomorphism

239
00:10:41,860 --> 00:10:45,070
intends to causes two attributes greater

240
00:10:45,070 --> 00:10:48,880
accuracy two algorithms greater predicts

241
00:10:48,880 --> 00:10:52,870
ability to them and also greater mercy

242
00:10:52,870 --> 00:10:55,269
to them greater empathy to them and that

243
00:10:55,269 --> 00:10:57,010
can be extremely dangerous because it

244
00:10:57,010 --> 00:10:58,990
will mean that we underestimate their

245
00:10:58,990 --> 00:11:02,140
propensity to make mistakes for errors

246
00:11:02,140 --> 00:11:03,420
to arise so

247
00:11:03,420 --> 00:11:04,800
generally I warned about that and I

248
00:11:04,800 --> 00:11:07,230
would still warn about that but

249
00:11:07,230 --> 00:11:09,590
interestingly right now there is a

250
00:11:09,590 --> 00:11:12,770
positive aspect to anthropomorphism

251
00:11:12,770 --> 00:11:15,690
that's we may want to take to take

252
00:11:15,690 --> 00:11:20,730
advantage of and that is that if people

253
00:11:20,730 --> 00:11:26,130
believe that a chapel for example is his

254
00:11:26,130 --> 00:11:29,610
is really emotionally engaged with them

255
00:11:29,610 --> 00:11:32,130
then they they get an original hit off

256
00:11:32,130 --> 00:11:34,920
that and that can be useful if people

257
00:11:34,920 --> 00:11:37,800
are lonely and right now there are an

258
00:11:37,800 --> 00:11:40,910
awful lot of people who are lonely that

259
00:11:40,910 --> 00:11:44,940
generally speaking I never ever when I'm

260
00:11:44,940 --> 00:11:48,420
working with elderly groups or disabled

261
00:11:48,420 --> 00:11:50,520
groups I never suggested that they talk

262
00:11:50,520 --> 00:11:54,090
to a chatbot I always suggest they talk

263
00:11:54,090 --> 00:11:54,990
to a real person

264
00:11:54,990 --> 00:11:58,640
I do social media or whatever but

265
00:11:58,640 --> 00:12:01,440
sometimes biggest panel to be choosers

266
00:12:01,440 --> 00:12:04,740
and the very good chat bots are actually

267
00:12:04,740 --> 00:12:06,840
quite nice to talk to you do get an

268
00:12:06,840 --> 00:12:09,030
emotional hit of them even though they

269
00:12:09,030 --> 00:12:12,020
are just scripts they're just

270
00:12:12,020 --> 00:12:15,450
effectively literary characters and the

271
00:12:15,450 --> 00:12:16,290
best one out there

272
00:12:16,290 --> 00:12:18,390
is Mitsuki I don't know if you've run it

273
00:12:18,390 --> 00:12:20,790
across Mitsuki but Mitsuki chatbot is

274
00:12:20,790 --> 00:12:24,060
the current Loeb enterprise 25 times

275
00:12:24,060 --> 00:12:27,360
labor Loebner prize meaning I think chat

276
00:12:27,360 --> 00:12:30,300
poor winner of the best human emulating

277
00:12:30,300 --> 00:12:32,550
chat bot and it's very good to talk to

278
00:12:32,550 --> 00:12:36,150
written by an absolutely astonishingly

279
00:12:36,150 --> 00:12:37,500
impressive chap called

280
00:12:37,500 --> 00:12:42,180
Steve walls wick in Yorkshire and he

281
00:12:42,180 --> 00:12:44,310
doesn't he's very careful he's very

282
00:12:44,310 --> 00:12:46,290
antsy anthropomorphism he always makes

283
00:12:46,290 --> 00:12:48,540
it clear that Mitsuki is not even a I

284
00:12:48,540 --> 00:12:51,210
she is absolutely it is completely

285
00:12:51,210 --> 00:12:54,600
programmed it is a new form of literary

286
00:12:54,600 --> 00:12:57,750
character character but it does give you

287
00:12:57,750 --> 00:13:01,070
some highly scalable way to provide

288
00:13:01,070 --> 00:13:03,720
company to people who are lonely and

289
00:13:03,720 --> 00:13:06,710
again not something that I would ever

290
00:13:06,710 --> 00:13:09,890
normally recommend during the good times

291
00:13:09,890 --> 00:13:14,490
but it is a clear example of where I

292
00:13:14,490 --> 00:13:16,400
think that the world has changed

293
00:13:16,400 --> 00:13:19,040
that's I would now potentially recommend

294
00:13:19,040 --> 00:13:20,990
people talking to a chatbot if they were

295
00:13:20,990 --> 00:13:24,550
lonely that doesn't mean that through

296
00:13:24,550 --> 00:13:27,500
morphism isn't still hugely dangerous in

297
00:13:27,500 --> 00:13:34,970
every other context so now this would be

298
00:13:34,970 --> 00:13:37,310
the point in the deck where I slapped a

299
00:13:37,310 --> 00:13:39,620
slag off the big tech companies for what

300
00:13:39,620 --> 00:13:41,210
terrible stuff they're doing because you

301
00:13:41,210 --> 00:13:44,000
know generally in the good times we're

302
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:45,500
all rolling in cash in the tech industry

303
00:13:45,500 --> 00:13:48,500
or some people are but the big companies

304
00:13:48,500 --> 00:13:50,450
certainly are and they need to be held

305
00:13:50,450 --> 00:13:52,580
to account because they have a huge

306
00:13:52,580 --> 00:13:54,440
privilege to do good and they don't

307
00:13:54,440 --> 00:13:56,870
always live up to that but right now I

308
00:13:56,870 --> 00:13:59,300
am quite happy with a loss of what

309
00:13:59,300 --> 00:14:00,680
they're doing I think they're really

310
00:14:00,680 --> 00:14:02,630
trying quite hard and we've done a lot

311
00:14:02,630 --> 00:14:05,990
of excellent work so far so for example

312
00:14:05,990 --> 00:14:08,630
Twitter Microsoft and Google really led

313
00:14:08,630 --> 00:14:10,310
the way in working from home they were

314
00:14:10,310 --> 00:14:11,360
some of the biggest companies in the

315
00:14:11,360 --> 00:14:13,370
world that came out very early and said

316
00:14:13,370 --> 00:14:16,339
we're moving our workforce entirely to

317
00:14:16,339 --> 00:14:18,290
work from home and that made it much

318
00:14:18,290 --> 00:14:20,210
easier for other companies to follow

319
00:14:20,210 --> 00:14:21,589
suit

320
00:14:21,589 --> 00:14:24,170
they did I certainly found it easier

321
00:14:24,170 --> 00:14:26,120
easier to persuade companies that this

322
00:14:26,120 --> 00:14:27,350
was necessary and they were going to

323
00:14:27,350 --> 00:14:28,730
have to do it because I could point to

324
00:14:28,730 --> 00:14:31,370
companies like Microsoft and say they're

325
00:14:31,370 --> 00:14:33,470
already doing it this is just a matter

326
00:14:33,470 --> 00:14:36,020
of time so that was extremely useful now

327
00:14:36,020 --> 00:14:38,330
you might argue correctly but it was a

328
00:14:38,330 --> 00:14:40,550
lot easier for them to do it but for

329
00:14:40,550 --> 00:14:42,860
many other companies it's a lot easier

330
00:14:42,860 --> 00:14:44,630
if the text to work from home that it is

331
00:14:44,630 --> 00:14:47,630
for other sectors but just because it's

332
00:14:47,630 --> 00:14:49,970
easy and it's good doesn't necessarily

333
00:14:49,970 --> 00:14:51,800
mean that people do it and when they do

334
00:14:51,800 --> 00:14:54,170
do it I still think they need it there's

335
00:14:54,170 --> 00:14:56,600
some applause for that that certainly

336
00:14:56,600 --> 00:14:58,760
made my life easier social media

337
00:14:58,760 --> 00:15:00,589
obviously I'd be slacking that off

338
00:15:00,589 --> 00:15:01,940
massively under the normal circumstances

339
00:15:01,940 --> 00:15:04,400
for an awful lot of stuff that nonsense

340
00:15:04,400 --> 00:15:07,160
the government say oh it but right now

341
00:15:07,160 --> 00:15:09,290
incredibly helpful incredibly helpful at

342
00:15:09,290 --> 00:15:11,750
stabilizing society as this virtual

343
00:15:11,750 --> 00:15:13,190
conference sangwich I can't really ever

344
00:15:13,190 --> 00:15:14,990
I used to work in virtual conferencing

345
00:15:14,990 --> 00:15:17,330
can't really see any terrible problem

346
00:15:17,330 --> 00:15:21,790
with it but right now fantastically good

347
00:15:21,790 --> 00:15:24,530
Netflix now I'd normally be telling them

348
00:15:24,530 --> 00:15:27,079
off for the enormous amount of bandwidth

349
00:15:27,079 --> 00:15:29,860
they use and then an energy use

350
00:15:29,860 --> 00:15:34,779
with streamed media but right now we

351
00:15:34,779 --> 00:15:37,660
have to acknowledge the fact that the

352
00:15:37,660 --> 00:15:42,959
widespread adoption and rollout of high

353
00:15:42,959 --> 00:15:46,810
bandwidth connectivity across the West

354
00:15:46,810 --> 00:15:49,870
developed countries has been led by the

355
00:15:49,870 --> 00:15:53,260
desire for Game of Thrones house of

356
00:15:53,260 --> 00:15:56,860
cards all of these TV shows and films

357
00:15:56,860 --> 00:15:58,660
that have come out of streamed media

358
00:15:58,660 --> 00:16:00,399
without them we wouldn't have the

359
00:16:00,399 --> 00:16:02,170
broadband infrastructure we do now and

360
00:16:02,170 --> 00:16:06,850
and so I have to be quite grateful that

361
00:16:06,850 --> 00:16:08,140
we've got that because without that

362
00:16:08,140 --> 00:16:10,240
society would be a hell of a lot less

363
00:16:10,240 --> 00:16:13,120
stable right now online deliveries

364
00:16:13,120 --> 00:16:16,209
reduced slack off sometimes online

365
00:16:16,209 --> 00:16:18,880
deliveries but for the amount of for

366
00:16:18,880 --> 00:16:20,680
example in London the traffic they gem

367
00:16:20,680 --> 00:16:23,709
alright but fantastic right now they've

368
00:16:23,709 --> 00:16:24,519
save lives

369
00:16:24,519 --> 00:16:26,620
hundreds of thousands of lives across

370
00:16:26,620 --> 00:16:28,870
Asia and will do the same across the

371
00:16:28,870 --> 00:16:29,790
West

372
00:16:29,790 --> 00:16:32,769
fantastic work they're a real example of

373
00:16:32,769 --> 00:16:35,920
tech helping to stabilize society and

374
00:16:35,920 --> 00:16:43,720
acting in a way that is just good but

375
00:16:43,720 --> 00:16:45,850
but if most of us most of us don't work

376
00:16:45,850 --> 00:16:47,350
for those companies we don't work for

377
00:16:47,350 --> 00:16:48,730
those big companies and we're probably

378
00:16:48,730 --> 00:16:50,940
most of us already working from home so

379
00:16:50,940 --> 00:16:54,160
does that mean we're done the only thing

380
00:16:54,160 --> 00:16:55,779
that we have left to do is wash our

381
00:16:55,779 --> 00:16:59,980
hands and stay at home actually I would

382
00:16:59,980 --> 00:17:02,260
argue there is a great deal more that we

383
00:17:02,260 --> 00:17:06,130
can do now I'm gonna go out on a limb

384
00:17:06,130 --> 00:17:09,849
and say that very few people in this

385
00:17:09,849 --> 00:17:11,679
attending this virtual conference today

386
00:17:11,679 --> 00:17:16,449
will be key workers in tech and and by

387
00:17:16,449 --> 00:17:17,919
key workers I mean people who are

388
00:17:17,919 --> 00:17:21,250
actively supporting key infrastructure

389
00:17:21,250 --> 00:17:24,640
that is live in the field today so that

390
00:17:24,640 --> 00:17:27,400
might be that might be banks that might

391
00:17:27,400 --> 00:17:31,480
be telecom systems that'll live and

392
00:17:31,480 --> 00:17:35,470
operational it might be those ecommerce

393
00:17:35,470 --> 00:17:39,130
sites that are helping you to do food

394
00:17:39,130 --> 00:17:44,010
deliveries those systems are now

395
00:17:44,010 --> 00:17:47,100
phenomenally important to the stability

396
00:17:47,100 --> 00:17:49,750
society they have suddenly they may not

397
00:17:49,750 --> 00:17:54,460
have been ridiculously important in the

398
00:17:54,460 --> 00:17:57,340
past they are now utterly vital critical

399
00:17:57,340 --> 00:17:59,080
infrastructure and the people who are

400
00:17:59,080 --> 00:18:00,910
supporting them will be under a great

401
00:18:00,910 --> 00:18:03,940
deal of strain and pressure and they may

402
00:18:03,940 --> 00:18:05,380
not be people that you ever thought

403
00:18:05,380 --> 00:18:08,200
about that much before now if your

404
00:18:08,200 --> 00:18:11,620
company produces or supports maintain

405
00:18:11,620 --> 00:18:14,920
systems that are that critical to your

406
00:18:14,920 --> 00:18:17,770
users then your your ops teams your

407
00:18:17,770 --> 00:18:20,140
maintenance teams will be ridiculously

408
00:18:20,140 --> 00:18:21,790
stressed out right at this moment even

409
00:18:21,790 --> 00:18:25,210
if you don't if you but perhaps you

410
00:18:25,210 --> 00:18:28,360
supply software that is integrated into

411
00:18:28,360 --> 00:18:29,860
those systems and you supply and you

412
00:18:29,860 --> 00:18:32,500
support that software even if you don't

413
00:18:32,500 --> 00:18:35,410
provide the software at the end if you

414
00:18:35,410 --> 00:18:36,370
provide some of the intermediate

415
00:18:36,370 --> 00:18:39,010
software again your support staff are

416
00:18:39,010 --> 00:18:41,380
likely to be extremely stressed out and

417
00:18:41,380 --> 00:18:43,990
hopefully overloaded so the best thing

418
00:18:43,990 --> 00:18:45,610
you can do for them and society in

419
00:18:45,610 --> 00:18:47,950
general is to lighten the load on them

420
00:18:47,950 --> 00:18:50,260
as much as possible and the best way to

421
00:18:50,260 --> 00:18:54,220
do that is by doing your job well so try

422
00:18:54,220 --> 00:18:56,650
not to be a burden on them perhaps in

423
00:18:56,650 --> 00:18:57,880
the past you would have asked them for

424
00:18:57,880 --> 00:19:00,520
help with something that you could maybe

425
00:19:00,520 --> 00:19:02,650
find a way of doing yourself now if you

426
00:19:02,650 --> 00:19:03,820
can do it safely yourself without

427
00:19:03,820 --> 00:19:06,430
killing their life systems you should

428
00:19:06,430 --> 00:19:08,050
have a go obviously don't kill their

429
00:19:08,050 --> 00:19:10,120
life systems that would be

430
00:19:10,120 --> 00:19:12,700
counterproductive but if you can do if

431
00:19:12,700 --> 00:19:14,260
anything you could do to take work of

432
00:19:14,260 --> 00:19:16,990
them is a good thing to do you might be

433
00:19:16,990 --> 00:19:19,810
asked to help out in support and

434
00:19:19,810 --> 00:19:23,650
maintenance now I know I used to work on

435
00:19:23,650 --> 00:19:26,560
it I was a used to support key

436
00:19:26,560 --> 00:19:28,450
infrastructure about 20 years and it was

437
00:19:28,450 --> 00:19:31,450
it was extremely stressful but it was a

438
00:19:31,450 --> 00:19:32,650
walk in the park

439
00:19:32,650 --> 00:19:35,140
competitors doing it today but I do know

440
00:19:35,140 --> 00:19:37,690
how hard it was to get people to join us

441
00:19:37,690 --> 00:19:40,120
to work on those projects you might be

442
00:19:40,120 --> 00:19:42,700
asked to help out and you might feel a

443
00:19:42,700 --> 00:19:45,150
little uncomfortable about doing that

444
00:19:45,150 --> 00:19:49,210
because after admit it's bad for your

445
00:19:49,210 --> 00:19:50,890
career generally in the past it's always

446
00:19:50,890 --> 00:19:52,450
been bad for your career to work on key

447
00:19:52,450 --> 00:19:55,090
on live and infrastructure maintenance

448
00:19:55,090 --> 00:19:56,240
because main

449
00:19:56,240 --> 00:19:59,030
it tends to be lower value within a

450
00:19:59,030 --> 00:20:01,100
company than the development of new

451
00:20:01,100 --> 00:20:03,710
features if you or is perceived as a

452
00:20:03,710 --> 00:20:04,880
lower value it's not actually lower

453
00:20:04,880 --> 00:20:06,440
value but it's perceived as low value

454
00:20:06,440 --> 00:20:09,290
and it tends to be less associated with

455
00:20:09,290 --> 00:20:11,720
promotion because you promotion comes

456
00:20:11,720 --> 00:20:13,430
from working on exciting new projects

457
00:20:13,430 --> 00:20:15,740
but right now it is the most important

458
00:20:15,740 --> 00:20:17,030
thing your company's doing

459
00:20:17,030 --> 00:20:18,830
it's amongst the most important things

460
00:20:18,830 --> 00:20:21,740
that that society is doing in in general

461
00:20:21,740 --> 00:20:24,050
you really need to help if you're asked

462
00:20:24,050 --> 00:20:28,640
please do help now other ways if you

463
00:20:28,640 --> 00:20:30,920
aren't working on new technology put

464
00:20:30,920 --> 00:20:32,720
yourself in the shoes of your users they

465
00:20:32,720 --> 00:20:34,310
will be really scared at the moments

466
00:20:34,310 --> 00:20:36,140
that make sure that you give them plenty

467
00:20:36,140 --> 00:20:38,690
of information but not too much very

468
00:20:38,690 --> 00:20:40,970
difficult but try to imagine that you

469
00:20:40,970 --> 00:20:43,460
are a scared older probably than you are

470
00:20:43,460 --> 00:20:46,190
user of your technology now full

471
00:20:46,190 --> 00:20:48,680
disclosure I'm in the vulnerable group I

472
00:20:48,680 --> 00:20:52,340
have MS and I'm not in extremely

473
00:20:52,340 --> 00:20:54,230
vulnerable group so you think of this

474
00:20:54,230 --> 00:20:56,600
for that but it does mean that and I'm

475
00:20:56,600 --> 00:20:58,430
very limited in what I can do where I

476
00:20:58,430 --> 00:21:02,450
can go and I really really am very

477
00:21:02,450 --> 00:21:04,310
reliant on the information that I

478
00:21:04,310 --> 00:21:05,960
receive at home because I can't go out

479
00:21:05,960 --> 00:21:07,940
and I can't chase this it's a hard to go

480
00:21:07,940 --> 00:21:09,860
and get information at the moment so you

481
00:21:09,860 --> 00:21:11,540
need to put yourself in the shoes of

482
00:21:11,540 --> 00:21:15,200
people like me bandwidth issues now

483
00:21:15,200 --> 00:21:17,900
right now our backbone is coping

484
00:21:17,900 --> 00:21:19,910
extraordinarily well with a very very

485
00:21:19,910 --> 00:21:22,420
increased workload particularly that's

486
00:21:22,420 --> 00:21:26,240
only an hour every hour as people join

487
00:21:26,240 --> 00:21:30,770
video conferences it is coping but it

488
00:21:30,770 --> 00:21:32,810
has reduced the resilience of the

489
00:21:32,810 --> 00:21:36,260
systems if you can operate your software

490
00:21:36,260 --> 00:21:38,720
in a lower bandwidth mode as Netflix of

491
00:21:38,720 --> 00:21:41,870
darn moving back to SD from HD then it

492
00:21:41,870 --> 00:21:43,580
might be a time to do it sought to think

493
00:21:43,580 --> 00:21:45,830
about it at least have this thoughts in

494
00:21:45,830 --> 00:21:47,660
your back pocket the systems might not

495
00:21:47,660 --> 00:21:49,820
be failing now but they have eaten up an

496
00:21:49,820 --> 00:21:52,670
awful lot of their redundancy so they

497
00:21:52,670 --> 00:21:54,980
may fail in the future so just be aware

498
00:21:54,980 --> 00:21:57,740
of that and also try not it isn't your

499
00:21:57,740 --> 00:21:59,180
users are not in the same position that

500
00:21:59,180 --> 00:22:02,720
they were six months ago back then you

501
00:22:02,720 --> 00:22:05,420
know change is good now change is not

502
00:22:05,420 --> 00:22:07,700
necessarily so good people might prefer

503
00:22:07,700 --> 00:22:09,590
stability they might prefer

504
00:22:09,590 --> 00:22:12,440
familiarity they also might not have the

505
00:22:12,440 --> 00:22:15,440
friends and neighbors and family members

506
00:22:15,440 --> 00:22:18,110
who used to help them cope with changes

507
00:22:18,110 --> 00:22:21,890
like upgrades so be more sparing in the

508
00:22:21,890 --> 00:22:25,039
changes that you roll out so is there

509
00:22:25,039 --> 00:22:30,140
anything else actually I can talk very

510
00:22:30,140 --> 00:22:31,610
quickly and I have actually moved

511
00:22:31,610 --> 00:22:32,779
through this faster than I was expecting

512
00:22:32,779 --> 00:22:35,600
so I can talk a little bit more slowly

513
00:22:35,600 --> 00:22:39,350
about this which is probably at least as

514
00:22:39,350 --> 00:22:41,090
important as anything else that I've

515
00:22:41,090 --> 00:22:45,500
said which is that climate change has

516
00:22:45,500 --> 00:22:47,899
not gone away so we're going to be an

517
00:22:47,899 --> 00:22:50,330
elitist ovid crisis for probably two

518
00:22:50,330 --> 00:22:52,789
years but during that time climate

519
00:22:52,789 --> 00:22:56,720
change will not massively improve to the

520
00:22:56,720 --> 00:22:58,100
extent that we don't need to worry about

521
00:22:58,100 --> 00:23:00,320
it anymore I'm afraid it is still a

522
00:23:00,320 --> 00:23:04,279
long-term major problem now Kovach 19 is

523
00:23:04,279 --> 00:23:06,679
not the apocalypse thank goodness it

524
00:23:06,679 --> 00:23:08,510
will be extremely bad but it's not the

525
00:23:08,510 --> 00:23:09,890
apocalypse but it doesn't mean that

526
00:23:09,890 --> 00:23:11,809
there are no apocalypse is coming down

527
00:23:11,809 --> 00:23:14,090
the line and some of those might be

528
00:23:14,090 --> 00:23:16,370
associated with or one of those the

529
00:23:16,370 --> 00:23:18,169
bullets actually hits us next might be

530
00:23:18,169 --> 00:23:20,059
associated with climate change we cannot

531
00:23:20,059 --> 00:23:22,279
give up and the decisions that we make

532
00:23:22,279 --> 00:23:23,840
in tech around climate change are

533
00:23:23,840 --> 00:23:27,230
long-term decisions if we and so it

534
00:23:27,230 --> 00:23:30,380
needs to get more right now one of the

535
00:23:30,380 --> 00:23:32,360
changes that you might well be looking

536
00:23:32,360 --> 00:23:34,399
at at the moment he's moving more of

537
00:23:34,399 --> 00:23:36,020
your infrastructure or all of your

538
00:23:36,020 --> 00:23:37,190
infrastructure or sorry your

539
00:23:37,190 --> 00:23:38,870
infrastructure to the cloud and that

540
00:23:38,870 --> 00:23:40,820
would be a perfectly sensible change to

541
00:23:40,820 --> 00:23:44,990
make but the cloud vendors are not equal

542
00:23:44,990 --> 00:23:49,309
when it comes to how green they are how

543
00:23:49,309 --> 00:23:51,679
good they are climate change so if you

544
00:23:51,679 --> 00:23:52,940
want to me to the cloud and you want an

545
00:23:52,940 --> 00:23:54,710
incredibly green have a look at Google

546
00:23:54,710 --> 00:23:57,409
Google is fantastically good all of

547
00:23:57,409 --> 00:23:59,270
their resources that moments are offset

548
00:23:59,270 --> 00:24:00,620
and they're looking to improve that in

549
00:24:00,620 --> 00:24:01,820
the future

550
00:24:01,820 --> 00:24:05,990
so as your fantastically good so as your

551
00:24:05,990 --> 00:24:08,059
Google fantastically excellent places to

552
00:24:08,059 --> 00:24:11,360
hosts it's a host AWS is not so

553
00:24:11,360 --> 00:24:15,190
clear-cut they vary enormously by region

554
00:24:15,190 --> 00:24:17,659
some of their regions are absolutely

555
00:24:17,659 --> 00:24:19,640
awful and some of their regions are

556
00:24:19,640 --> 00:24:22,830
pretty good so parts probably

557
00:24:22,830 --> 00:24:26,100
most awful region is the default it's us

558
00:24:26,100 --> 00:24:29,760
East and that is overwhelmingly fossil

559
00:24:29,760 --> 00:24:33,000
fuel powered so if you can don't host

560
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:35,580
anything in USA's if you want a host

561
00:24:35,580 --> 00:24:38,880
label WS do try very hard to host in

562
00:24:38,880 --> 00:24:40,500
that three and therefore green regions

563
00:24:40,500 --> 00:24:44,490
which are Dublin Frankfurt Canada and

564
00:24:44,490 --> 00:24:47,880
Oregon now they're in those regions

565
00:24:47,880 --> 00:24:49,529
those reasons aren't quite as good as

566
00:24:49,529 --> 00:24:51,590
Google or as your to be honest but

567
00:24:51,590 --> 00:24:54,450
actually they really aren't anywhere

568
00:24:54,450 --> 00:24:55,919
near as good as Google or ashore but

569
00:24:55,919 --> 00:24:58,080
they're vastly better than the other AWS

570
00:24:58,080 --> 00:25:00,570
regions so if you have two five stay WS

571
00:25:00,570 --> 00:25:02,460
and I know most of us do and I know you

572
00:25:02,460 --> 00:25:04,830
all want to stay particular AWS try to

573
00:25:04,830 --> 00:25:06,779
keep to those regions they are at least

574
00:25:06,779 --> 00:25:15,419
offset so we're in a very interesting

575
00:25:15,419 --> 00:25:19,260
time at the moment things in two years

576
00:25:19,260 --> 00:25:21,120
time will be completely different to how

577
00:25:21,120 --> 00:25:24,870
we with to what we've bought so what we

578
00:25:24,870 --> 00:25:28,620
think is acceptable and good now we are

579
00:25:28,620 --> 00:25:31,740
likely to move in a direction that to

580
00:25:31,740 --> 00:25:35,190
our current thinking will seem extremely

581
00:25:35,190 --> 00:25:38,570
dystopian but by the time we get there

582
00:25:38,570 --> 00:25:41,909
on the one hand will be totally used to

583
00:25:41,909 --> 00:25:43,110
it and we wrote that it won't seem

584
00:25:43,110 --> 00:25:45,000
dystopian it anymore it will seem fine

585
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:47,970
but we need to be aware of the changes

586
00:25:47,970 --> 00:25:50,820
that we are making and whether and if we

587
00:25:50,820 --> 00:25:52,889
want to rule any of them back I think we

588
00:25:52,889 --> 00:25:55,429
need to be particularly careful about

589
00:25:55,429 --> 00:25:59,639
over empathizing with computers the

590
00:25:59,639 --> 00:26:01,529
dangers of anthropomorphism because

591
00:26:01,529 --> 00:26:03,720
computers will save as tech will save a

592
00:26:03,720 --> 00:26:05,519
source able huge number of lives and

593
00:26:05,519 --> 00:26:07,460
that's great but we have to be aware of

594
00:26:07,460 --> 00:26:09,690
whether that doesn't mean that it's

595
00:26:09,690 --> 00:26:12,870
human and we need to be very very

596
00:26:12,870 --> 00:26:14,490
careful about surveillance because

597
00:26:14,490 --> 00:26:16,320
unless we go down the South Korean

598
00:26:16,320 --> 00:26:18,659
routes where it's obvious to us it will

599
00:26:18,659 --> 00:26:21,240
just become a habit that we don't notice

600
00:26:21,240 --> 00:26:24,000
and we never think about we don't

601
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:26,309
challenge and and that would be a shame

602
00:26:26,309 --> 00:26:28,740
I must refer to if we made all the data

603
00:26:28,740 --> 00:26:32,190
that we were observing open to all so if

604
00:26:32,190 --> 00:26:33,299
you're interested in any of these

605
00:26:33,299 --> 00:26:34,889
thoughts you could read one of my

606
00:26:34,889 --> 00:26:36,540
science fiction novels so I'm

607
00:26:36,540 --> 00:26:37,880
science-fiction writer I write about

608
00:26:37,880 --> 00:26:40,350
post-apocalyptic sci-fi a lot of it

609
00:26:40,350 --> 00:26:41,940
covers the things that I've been talking

610
00:26:41,940 --> 00:26:44,460
about today and it's all available on

611
00:26:44,460 --> 00:26:47,280
Amazon where it's extremely reasonably

612
00:26:47,280 --> 00:26:49,590
priced 99p and it's a very good read

613
00:26:49,590 --> 00:26:53,700
so that is me done I think we can move

614
00:26:53,700 --> 00:26:58,920
over to the to the questions if there's

615
00:26:58,920 --> 00:27:06,140
anybody left if I haven't just put your

616
00:27:06,860 --> 00:27:13,800
you so much it was really inspiring we

617
00:27:13,800 --> 00:27:18,860
have a question not me on screen so

618
00:27:18,860 --> 00:27:24,090
everyone can read that so do you believe

619
00:27:24,090 --> 00:27:26,880
we can keep a positive mindset during

620
00:27:26,880 --> 00:27:31,470
these challenging times yes we good

621
00:27:31,470 --> 00:27:34,170
enough it's been a lot of us but I live

622
00:27:34,170 --> 00:27:38,910
a lot here writing dystopian cypher this

623
00:27:38,910 --> 00:27:42,510
in this is not the apocalypse it's

624
00:27:42,510 --> 00:27:49,800
terrible and it could be a lot worse I

625
00:27:49,800 --> 00:27:51,390
can assure you it could be a lot worse

626
00:27:51,390 --> 00:27:54,240
and there will be positive sides to it

627
00:27:54,240 --> 00:27:57,180
we will spend a lot more time will be it

628
00:27:57,180 --> 00:27:59,220
virtually with our friends and our

629
00:27:59,220 --> 00:28:02,490
neighbors and our family will think a

630
00:28:02,490 --> 00:28:04,410
lot more about others it will change us

631
00:28:04,410 --> 00:28:06,330
into people who think much more about

632
00:28:06,330 --> 00:28:09,480
others and much less about money and

633
00:28:09,480 --> 00:28:11,370
things that don't necessarily matter so

634
00:28:11,370 --> 00:28:15,510
much in the long run it's it's terrible

635
00:28:15,510 --> 00:28:17,520
to ever say that anything positive will

636
00:28:17,520 --> 00:28:19,890
come out of an awful lot of debt deaths

637
00:28:19,890 --> 00:28:23,250
but I it's somebody that I think when I

638
00:28:23,250 --> 00:28:25,740
first I thought we'd been a much worse

639
00:28:25,740 --> 00:28:28,110
position now than we are when I first

640
00:28:28,110 --> 00:28:31,320
started to see this happening in in in

641
00:28:31,320 --> 00:28:34,020
China because we're still in complete

642
00:28:34,020 --> 00:28:36,360
denial of its we were talking about herd

643
00:28:36,360 --> 00:28:39,480
immunity and if herd immunity if we'd

644
00:28:39,480 --> 00:28:42,210
pursued herd immunity in the UK we would

645
00:28:42,210 --> 00:28:44,610
have had half a million a million deaths

646
00:28:44,610 --> 00:28:50,190
easily I suspect and and that would him

647
00:28:50,190 --> 00:28:52,080
and what worried me most about that was

648
00:28:52,080 --> 00:28:54,240
actually not the deaths it was the good

649
00:28:54,240 --> 00:28:56,279
it was the kind of people that that

650
00:28:56,279 --> 00:28:59,580
would have turned us into instead we've

651
00:28:59,580 --> 00:29:04,169
engaged in the most in the largest piece

652
00:29:04,169 --> 00:29:06,539
of collective action to sleep others

653
00:29:06,539 --> 00:29:08,820
that the world has ever seen and that

654
00:29:08,820 --> 00:29:10,710
will turn this into a different kind of

655
00:29:10,710 --> 00:29:13,200
set of people and I'm very pleased that

656
00:29:13,200 --> 00:29:15,029
we're gonna be that second set not that

657
00:29:15,029 --> 00:29:20,580
versa okay thank you thank you again

658
00:29:20,580 --> 00:29:24,918
it was awesome TED talk and
