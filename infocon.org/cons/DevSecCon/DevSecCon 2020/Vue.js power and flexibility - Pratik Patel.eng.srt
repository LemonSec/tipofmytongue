1
00:00:01,360 --> 00:00:03,439
all right good afternoon everybody

2
00:00:03,439 --> 00:00:05,120
and thank you venkat for that nice

3
00:00:05,120 --> 00:00:08,160
introduction uh my name is pratik patel

4
00:00:08,160 --> 00:00:10,800
i am going to be talking about vue.js

5
00:00:10,800 --> 00:00:11,920
today

6
00:00:11,920 --> 00:00:14,559
and uh just to since we're a little bit

7
00:00:14,559 --> 00:00:15,120
early

8
00:00:15,120 --> 00:00:17,279
i will just give a quick introduction to

9
00:00:17,279 --> 00:00:18,240
myself

10
00:00:18,240 --> 00:00:20,800
i'm a java champion but i also do lots

11
00:00:20,800 --> 00:00:23,279
of stuff with javascript python

12
00:00:23,279 --> 00:00:25,840
and many other languages and our rough

13
00:00:25,840 --> 00:00:26,640
outline

14
00:00:26,640 --> 00:00:29,679
for today's session is what you see on

15
00:00:29,679 --> 00:00:30,640
the screen

16
00:00:30,640 --> 00:00:32,960
and of course i'll make the code

17
00:00:32,960 --> 00:00:34,160
available

18
00:00:34,160 --> 00:00:37,120
we're not going to really use the slide

19
00:00:37,120 --> 00:00:38,640
deck much today

20
00:00:38,640 --> 00:00:40,960
since this is an abbreviated 30 minute

21
00:00:40,960 --> 00:00:42,000
session but

22
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:44,719
what i do want to start off with is why

23
00:00:44,719 --> 00:00:45,600
do we want

24
00:00:45,600 --> 00:00:48,640
to consider using vue.js in our

25
00:00:48,640 --> 00:00:49,920
application

26
00:00:49,920 --> 00:00:52,800
all right so this is a great question

27
00:00:52,800 --> 00:00:54,000
because

28
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:57,039
as we've seen even just today with the

29
00:00:57,039 --> 00:00:58,640
number of different web frameworks

30
00:00:58,640 --> 00:01:01,840
discussed specifically angular and react

31
00:01:01,840 --> 00:01:04,559
there is plenty of choice out there for

32
00:01:04,559 --> 00:01:06,240
what to build your front end in

33
00:01:06,240 --> 00:01:07,600
we're not really going to talk about the

34
00:01:07,600 --> 00:01:09,119
back end that much we're going to focus

35
00:01:09,119 --> 00:01:10,320
on the front end today

36
00:01:10,320 --> 00:01:12,080
but why view vue.js and i'll tell you

37
00:01:12,080 --> 00:01:14,000
why i think vue.js is a wonderful

38
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:14,799
framework

39
00:01:14,799 --> 00:01:17,680
for building front-end applications for

40
00:01:17,680 --> 00:01:18,000
me

41
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:20,240
the first thing is that vue has a low

42
00:01:20,240 --> 00:01:21,280
learning curve

43
00:01:21,280 --> 00:01:23,520
and i think this is super important in

44
00:01:23,520 --> 00:01:24,560
today's world that

45
00:01:24,560 --> 00:01:27,520
you are able to get started and be

46
00:01:27,520 --> 00:01:28,320
productive

47
00:01:28,320 --> 00:01:31,600
as a developer very quickly okay

48
00:01:31,600 --> 00:01:35,280
now view is also known as a progressive

49
00:01:35,280 --> 00:01:37,600
framework so what that means is that

50
00:01:37,600 --> 00:01:40,320
we start simple and then we add in

51
00:01:40,320 --> 00:01:41,920
features as we need them

52
00:01:41,920 --> 00:01:45,119
so we don't have to go and learn a whole

53
00:01:45,119 --> 00:01:45,920
bunch of things

54
00:01:45,920 --> 00:01:48,159
all at once we can just learn a few

55
00:01:48,159 --> 00:01:50,399
simple things to get started with

56
00:01:50,399 --> 00:01:52,479
with vue.js and then we can add in

57
00:01:52,479 --> 00:01:54,000
features as we need them

58
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:56,640
if you need to have state management you

59
00:01:56,640 --> 00:01:58,079
can add in view wax

60
00:01:58,079 --> 00:02:00,399
if you need client-side routing you can

61
00:02:00,399 --> 00:02:02,000
go add-in view router

62
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:03,439
if you want to build a larger

63
00:02:03,439 --> 00:02:05,119
application that has lots of bells and

64
00:02:05,119 --> 00:02:06,320
whistles

65
00:02:06,320 --> 00:02:08,560
built-in with lots of features out of

66
00:02:08,560 --> 00:02:09,598
the box

67
00:02:09,598 --> 00:02:12,959
you can then use a platform like nux.js

68
00:02:12,959 --> 00:02:16,720
which is a nice framework for building

69
00:02:16,720 --> 00:02:17,360
vue.js

70
00:02:17,360 --> 00:02:19,840
applications the other thing about

71
00:02:19,840 --> 00:02:21,520
vue.js that i find really nice

72
00:02:21,520 --> 00:02:24,400
is that developing in view is intuitive

73
00:02:24,400 --> 00:02:26,239
and conventions are natural

74
00:02:26,239 --> 00:02:29,599
it's not much of an effort to

75
00:02:29,599 --> 00:02:32,319
learn some of the things that you need

76
00:02:32,319 --> 00:02:34,319
to know in vjs because they just kind of

77
00:02:34,319 --> 00:02:35,680
come naturally to you or

78
00:02:35,680 --> 00:02:37,440
you're just intuitive which i think is

79
00:02:37,440 --> 00:02:39,360
great and

80
00:02:39,360 --> 00:02:41,760
one interesting thing about vue is that

81
00:02:41,760 --> 00:02:42,640
it's not

82
00:02:42,640 --> 00:02:44,959
backed by company it's a hundred percent

83
00:02:44,959 --> 00:02:46,319
community driven

84
00:02:46,319 --> 00:02:48,480
so for example angular is backed by

85
00:02:48,480 --> 00:02:50,959
google of course react is backed by

86
00:02:50,959 --> 00:02:51,680
facebook

87
00:02:51,680 --> 00:02:54,879
the view is 100 community driven and

88
00:02:54,879 --> 00:02:57,120
they support themselves through

89
00:02:57,120 --> 00:02:59,280
donations and other things

90
00:02:59,280 --> 00:03:01,519
but they're very focused on what users

91
00:03:01,519 --> 00:03:02,800
actually want

92
00:03:02,800 --> 00:03:04,400
people like you and me developers who

93
00:03:04,400 --> 00:03:06,959
are building real world applications

94
00:03:06,959 --> 00:03:09,440
can be part of the process for enhancing

95
00:03:09,440 --> 00:03:10,480
the framework

96
00:03:10,480 --> 00:03:14,080
and adding new features etc etc

97
00:03:14,080 --> 00:03:16,800
alright so with that front matter out of

98
00:03:16,800 --> 00:03:17,599
the way

99
00:03:17,599 --> 00:03:20,239
in terms of why are we interested in vjs

100
00:03:20,239 --> 00:03:22,000
let's look at a super simple view

101
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:23,120
application

102
00:03:23,120 --> 00:03:26,799
right so what we'll do is we will go

103
00:03:26,799 --> 00:03:30,879
in and look at just a blank web page to

104
00:03:30,879 --> 00:03:32,319
start off with let's make this a little

105
00:03:32,319 --> 00:03:33,440
bit bigger

106
00:03:33,440 --> 00:03:35,200
and let's get our web browser up next to

107
00:03:35,200 --> 00:03:36,959
it okay so you can see this is a simple

108
00:03:36,959 --> 00:03:40,080
web page and the key part here is i have

109
00:03:40,080 --> 00:03:42,000
a script tag that points to the vue.js

110
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:42,879
library

111
00:03:42,879 --> 00:03:46,239
now for the first few examples

112
00:03:46,239 --> 00:03:49,360
we will just literally use a web page

113
00:03:49,360 --> 00:03:51,200
that imports the view library there's no

114
00:03:51,200 --> 00:03:52,000
web pack

115
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:54,400
there's no npm there's no other tooling

116
00:03:54,400 --> 00:03:55,760
or plumbing around it

117
00:03:55,760 --> 00:03:58,159
this is what i mean by you can start

118
00:03:58,159 --> 00:03:59,519
very very simply

119
00:03:59,519 --> 00:04:01,439
and then build up and add features as

120
00:04:01,439 --> 00:04:04,000
you need them

121
00:04:06,560 --> 00:04:08,239
okay it looks like someone is having

122
00:04:08,239 --> 00:04:11,360
trouble seeing my computer screen

123
00:04:11,360 --> 00:04:15,840
oh thank you okay

124
00:04:18,399 --> 00:04:20,639
can you do a share all right please

125
00:04:20,639 --> 00:04:21,519
there you go

126
00:04:21,519 --> 00:04:25,040
and we should here we go all right

127
00:04:25,040 --> 00:04:26,320
i thought it was already being shared

128
00:04:26,320 --> 00:04:28,800
okay don't worry you didn't miss much

129
00:04:28,800 --> 00:04:30,960
i was just showing some slides uh that i

130
00:04:30,960 --> 00:04:32,639
talked over anyway so

131
00:04:32,639 --> 00:04:35,520
let's talk about uh building a basic

132
00:04:35,520 --> 00:04:37,120
view application again

133
00:04:37,120 --> 00:04:39,600
what i have here is a very simple html

134
00:04:39,600 --> 00:04:40,479
page

135
00:04:40,479 --> 00:04:44,320
and then we have the script tag which

136
00:04:44,320 --> 00:04:46,560
imports the view library into it

137
00:04:46,560 --> 00:04:48,400
right and if we see here we just have a

138
00:04:48,400 --> 00:04:50,320
simple h1 with the hello in it

139
00:04:50,320 --> 00:04:52,639
and again this doesn't have any webpack

140
00:04:52,639 --> 00:04:54,720
or any tooling or live updating

141
00:04:54,720 --> 00:04:57,280
you can do all those things with vue.js

142
00:04:57,280 --> 00:04:58,720
but we're not going to do them

143
00:04:58,720 --> 00:05:00,320
just yet we're going to keep it as

144
00:05:00,320 --> 00:05:01,840
simple as possible and build something

145
00:05:01,840 --> 00:05:02,639
out okay

146
00:05:02,639 --> 00:05:06,160
so you can say hello from atlanta where

147
00:05:06,160 --> 00:05:07,280
i live

148
00:05:07,280 --> 00:05:09,520
and i'm going to save that reload and of

149
00:05:09,520 --> 00:05:10,960
course we're not doing any real view yet

150
00:05:10,960 --> 00:05:12,639
but we will in just a second

151
00:05:12,639 --> 00:05:14,479
right so now that we've imported the

152
00:05:14,479 --> 00:05:16,080
view library up here we

153
00:05:16,080 --> 00:05:18,240
go and initialize our view instance we

154
00:05:18,240 --> 00:05:19,360
say new view

155
00:05:19,360 --> 00:05:22,000
and we say mount our view application

156
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:23,919
into the app div which is right here

157
00:05:23,919 --> 00:05:25,919
okay and then i have a data portion here

158
00:05:25,919 --> 00:05:26,960
which we're going to use in just a

159
00:05:26,960 --> 00:05:27,840
second

160
00:05:27,840 --> 00:05:30,479
now our first bullet point was how do we

161
00:05:30,479 --> 00:05:31,440
work with data

162
00:05:31,440 --> 00:05:33,360
so i have this data block declared

163
00:05:33,360 --> 00:05:34,639
inside of

164
00:05:34,639 --> 00:05:36,639
my view instance and then i have this

165
00:05:36,639 --> 00:05:38,320
greeting object here how do i show this

166
00:05:38,320 --> 00:05:40,160
greeting which says hello all the talks

167
00:05:40,160 --> 00:05:42,720
let's get rid of this for now okay so

168
00:05:42,720 --> 00:05:44,240
get rid of this we'll reload it you'll

169
00:05:44,240 --> 00:05:45,600
see nothing shows up

170
00:05:45,600 --> 00:05:47,280
what i can do is i can use semantic

171
00:05:47,280 --> 00:05:49,840
syntax like this and simply grab that

172
00:05:49,840 --> 00:05:51,520
greeting variable that i declared in the

173
00:05:51,520 --> 00:05:53,199
data portion of this

174
00:05:53,199 --> 00:05:56,720
put it in like so reload and you'll see

175
00:05:56,720 --> 00:05:59,039
that it says hello all the talks

176
00:05:59,039 --> 00:06:02,639
but it has the uh i tag which is italics

177
00:06:02,639 --> 00:06:03,759
of course in html

178
00:06:03,759 --> 00:06:06,880
shown there what's going on there well

179
00:06:06,880 --> 00:06:10,240
when we use this semantic way to show

180
00:06:10,240 --> 00:06:12,000
this it literally shows exactly what we

181
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:13,520
have in the variable that's not exactly

182
00:06:13,520 --> 00:06:14,639
what we want here

183
00:06:14,639 --> 00:06:16,240
so let's get rid of this and let's use

184
00:06:16,240 --> 00:06:18,960
the declarative way to use this data

185
00:06:18,960 --> 00:06:22,400
so what we'll do here is we'll say

186
00:06:22,400 --> 00:06:25,840
v dash text right so this is

187
00:06:25,840 --> 00:06:29,199
a uh the declared way to get to this and

188
00:06:29,199 --> 00:06:32,639
uh it's also sometimes referred to as

189
00:06:32,639 --> 00:06:36,080
um the uh basically

190
00:06:36,080 --> 00:06:38,080
the tag wave we'll get to the tags in

191
00:06:38,080 --> 00:06:39,840
just a second so let's say

192
00:06:39,840 --> 00:06:43,520
greeting save and reload and we're still

193
00:06:43,520 --> 00:06:45,120
seeing the same thing so we still saw

194
00:06:45,120 --> 00:06:46,560
the same thing let's uh

195
00:06:46,560 --> 00:06:48,000
change this to make sure that this

196
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:49,759
worked right so you'll see that hello

197
00:06:49,759 --> 00:06:52,160
all the talks 2020 showed up which is

198
00:06:52,160 --> 00:06:54,639
what i just changed right here now what

199
00:06:54,639 --> 00:06:57,039
if we want to show this as html and not

200
00:06:57,039 --> 00:06:59,120
a straight text we can use

201
00:06:59,120 --> 00:07:02,000
v html now we'll reload this and now

202
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:04,080
you'll see that shows as we expected

203
00:07:04,080 --> 00:07:07,039
hello all the talks 2020 and italics

204
00:07:07,039 --> 00:07:07,840
right

205
00:07:07,840 --> 00:07:10,400
so i've used the directive here to go

206
00:07:10,400 --> 00:07:12,720
and grab this data and show that

207
00:07:12,720 --> 00:07:14,800
so pretty straightforward so working

208
00:07:14,800 --> 00:07:16,400
with html fragments

209
00:07:16,400 --> 00:07:19,199
using declarative and semantic syntax so

210
00:07:19,199 --> 00:07:20,319
again

211
00:07:20,319 --> 00:07:23,440
this is declarative when we use v dash

212
00:07:23,440 --> 00:07:24,240
html

213
00:07:24,240 --> 00:07:27,680
inside of almost like an attribute

214
00:07:27,680 --> 00:07:30,319
we could also do this which would of

215
00:07:30,319 --> 00:07:30,960
course

216
00:07:30,960 --> 00:07:34,160
not do the html but just show the street

217
00:07:34,160 --> 00:07:36,080
text now the difference between

218
00:07:36,080 --> 00:07:39,039
let's uh let's copy this line right here

219
00:07:39,039 --> 00:07:39,680
and

220
00:07:39,680 --> 00:07:42,720
let's say we did v dash text

221
00:07:42,720 --> 00:07:44,160
let's just show them next to each other

222
00:07:44,160 --> 00:07:46,080
real quick okay let's reload this

223
00:07:46,080 --> 00:07:47,840
now the difference between these two is

224
00:07:47,840 --> 00:07:50,160
the v text takes literally the text that

225
00:07:50,160 --> 00:07:52,080
we have in the data or the string

226
00:07:52,080 --> 00:07:55,680
and shows it in the html what b html

227
00:07:55,680 --> 00:07:56,560
does

228
00:07:56,560 --> 00:07:59,520
is that it goes and actually mounts it

229
00:07:59,520 --> 00:08:01,280
as inner html

230
00:08:01,280 --> 00:08:02,879
so we have to be a little bit careful

231
00:08:02,879 --> 00:08:05,039
when we do v html because we're

232
00:08:05,039 --> 00:08:06,639
literally mounting

233
00:08:06,639 --> 00:08:09,599
that whatever that data is in this case

234
00:08:09,599 --> 00:08:11,280
this fragment right here

235
00:08:11,280 --> 00:08:13,599
in as inner html so we just need to be a

236
00:08:13,599 --> 00:08:14,400
little bit careful

237
00:08:14,400 --> 00:08:17,280
that we do use that in the right way

238
00:08:17,280 --> 00:08:18,160
okay

239
00:08:18,160 --> 00:08:21,520
so we have

240
00:08:21,520 --> 00:08:24,000
shown the declarative and semantic way

241
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:26,000
use html fragments and

242
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:27,280
now let's do something else actually

243
00:08:27,280 --> 00:08:28,720
let's do a little bit uh something a

244
00:08:28,720 --> 00:08:30,639
little bit different let's say

245
00:08:30,639 --> 00:08:32,799
um how about let's show the time so

246
00:08:32,799 --> 00:08:33,679
we'll say time

247
00:08:33,679 --> 00:08:35,519
new date now we're using a javascript

248
00:08:35,519 --> 00:08:37,200
object date of course

249
00:08:37,200 --> 00:08:39,039
and then i'll come into here in the

250
00:08:39,039 --> 00:08:41,200
second v text and say instead of

251
00:08:41,200 --> 00:08:41,839
greeting

252
00:08:41,839 --> 00:08:43,919
let's show the time let's save it and

253
00:08:43,919 --> 00:08:46,160
reload it and here we go here's our time

254
00:08:46,160 --> 00:08:49,519
okay now what if we only want to show

255
00:08:49,519 --> 00:08:51,760
the time if it's after 12 o'clock how

256
00:08:51,760 --> 00:08:54,640
do we do something like that so let's go

257
00:08:54,640 --> 00:08:56,560
back into our data block here and we'll

258
00:08:56,560 --> 00:08:58,080
say time of day

259
00:08:58,080 --> 00:09:02,240
colon function and let's return

260
00:09:02,240 --> 00:09:05,440
12 for noon for example

261
00:09:05,440 --> 00:09:09,200
okay now let's create

262
00:09:09,200 --> 00:09:13,279
a another block here and let's say

263
00:09:13,279 --> 00:09:15,680
we'll just call this a div for now we'll

264
00:09:15,680 --> 00:09:16,720
say

265
00:09:16,720 --> 00:09:20,160
v dash if okay equals

266
00:09:20,160 --> 00:09:21,760
and let's put an expression inside of

267
00:09:21,760 --> 00:09:23,600
this we'll say

268
00:09:23,600 --> 00:09:26,399
if this is our variable or this is what

269
00:09:26,399 --> 00:09:29,040
we're going to use here that time

270
00:09:29,040 --> 00:09:32,320
right and i need to have this in the

271
00:09:32,320 --> 00:09:34,080
right place it needs to be inside

272
00:09:34,080 --> 00:09:36,880
the dip tag not outside because that is

273
00:09:36,880 --> 00:09:38,240
what's going to get toggled

274
00:09:38,240 --> 00:09:40,399
let's reformat this a little bit all

275
00:09:40,399 --> 00:09:41,279
right so we'll say

276
00:09:41,279 --> 00:09:44,800
if time of day is greater than 10

277
00:09:44,800 --> 00:09:47,440
then show the time okay so let's save

278
00:09:47,440 --> 00:09:48,080
that

279
00:09:48,080 --> 00:09:49,519
let's reload it and you can see it

280
00:09:49,519 --> 00:09:51,600
doesn't show anymore but if we say at

281
00:09:51,600 --> 00:09:52,720
the time of day

282
00:09:52,720 --> 00:09:54,240
which again time of day is down here

283
00:09:54,240 --> 00:09:56,480
function return 12. we just hard coded

284
00:09:56,480 --> 00:09:57,200
this

285
00:09:57,200 --> 00:09:59,760
for the time being let's make that 13

286
00:09:59,760 --> 00:10:00,480
save it

287
00:10:00,480 --> 00:10:05,839
and reload it and it still doesn't work

288
00:10:05,920 --> 00:10:09,120
what have we done wrong here

289
00:10:09,120 --> 00:10:12,399
okay let's actually say

290
00:10:12,399 --> 00:10:13,920
i did test this out earlier but

291
00:10:13,920 --> 00:10:16,480
obviously i don't know how to

292
00:10:16,480 --> 00:10:19,760
do this properly

293
00:10:19,760 --> 00:10:22,640
time of day

294
00:10:25,600 --> 00:10:27,600
b dash of time of day greater than 12

295
00:10:27,600 --> 00:10:29,279
yep that should be good

296
00:10:29,279 --> 00:10:31,600
what have we done wrong here let's come

297
00:10:31,600 --> 00:10:33,519
into here let's put a larger number in

298
00:10:33,519 --> 00:10:34,560
here

299
00:10:34,560 --> 00:10:36,079
and of course none of this is going to

300
00:10:36,079 --> 00:10:37,760
work because i'm doing a live demo

301
00:10:37,760 --> 00:10:40,640
okay so if we look at this let's examine

302
00:10:40,640 --> 00:10:42,320
this for just a second we said

303
00:10:42,320 --> 00:10:45,120
that we have this time of day function

304
00:10:45,120 --> 00:10:46,959
it returns the value 12. we could have

305
00:10:46,959 --> 00:10:49,279
just used a number i guess here

306
00:10:49,279 --> 00:10:52,560
and then we say uh maybe it's because we

307
00:10:52,560 --> 00:10:53,920
don't have this in the actual

308
00:10:53,920 --> 00:10:56,640
tag so let's change that to an h1 and

309
00:10:56,640 --> 00:11:00,800
let's reload that and none of this is

310
00:11:00,800 --> 00:11:02,480
working so we'll come back to v dash f

311
00:11:02,480 --> 00:11:03,920
in a bit right i have to think about

312
00:11:03,920 --> 00:11:04,640
what

313
00:11:04,640 --> 00:11:07,360
we have done wrong here right that

314
00:11:07,360 --> 00:11:09,519
should be working

315
00:11:09,519 --> 00:11:13,120
dash if equals 12.

316
00:11:13,120 --> 00:11:16,560
okay anyways we will come back to this

317
00:11:16,560 --> 00:11:20,000
in just a minute and we'll see what we

318
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:21,360
can do

319
00:11:21,360 --> 00:11:24,399
um what we

320
00:11:24,399 --> 00:11:26,079
uh what we can do with this let's get

321
00:11:26,079 --> 00:11:28,000
rid of this for now okay we've talked

322
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:30,399
about uh the conditional in just a

323
00:11:30,399 --> 00:11:31,680
second i'll figure out what's wrong with

324
00:11:31,680 --> 00:11:33,360
that

325
00:11:33,360 --> 00:11:36,160
but let's talk about properties and what

326
00:11:36,160 --> 00:11:37,680
we can do with them

327
00:11:37,680 --> 00:11:40,560
and other things around this first let's

328
00:11:40,560 --> 00:11:41,360
have a look

329
00:11:41,360 --> 00:11:45,279
at a v-4 so let's say

330
00:11:45,279 --> 00:11:50,079
h1 v-4

331
00:11:50,399 --> 00:11:53,120
and we'll create the data for this

332
00:11:53,120 --> 00:11:54,160
equals

333
00:11:54,160 --> 00:11:57,519
url and you in

334
00:11:57,519 --> 00:12:01,360
you you are els

335
00:12:01,360 --> 00:12:03,600
and then we'll just show the url here

336
00:12:03,600 --> 00:12:05,600
we'll create a list of urls here in just

337
00:12:05,600 --> 00:12:06,639
a second

338
00:12:06,639 --> 00:12:12,480
okay so there's our url comma urls

339
00:12:12,480 --> 00:12:15,120
colon and then let's create a simple

340
00:12:15,120 --> 00:12:16,399
list

341
00:12:16,399 --> 00:12:19,440
and we'll say url one right we'll fill

342
00:12:19,440 --> 00:12:21,600
this in with urls later if we have time

343
00:12:21,600 --> 00:12:24,800
url to let's save that and let's reload

344
00:12:24,800 --> 00:12:26,240
this and you can see we have

345
00:12:26,240 --> 00:12:29,680
a v 4 here and what this does is this is

346
00:12:29,680 --> 00:12:30,160
base

347
00:12:30,160 --> 00:12:33,440
a basic iterator around how we build

348
00:12:33,440 --> 00:12:35,680
this part out here right this is

349
00:12:35,680 --> 00:12:37,519
basically how we do

350
00:12:37,519 --> 00:12:40,320
looping so we say urls url one two three

351
00:12:40,320 --> 00:12:42,240
if i add a few more in here

352
00:12:42,240 --> 00:12:45,360
you'll see that they will also pop up

353
00:12:45,360 --> 00:12:47,040
right i'm gonna just be lazy and copy

354
00:12:47,040 --> 00:12:49,519
those again we're looking at how we do a

355
00:12:49,519 --> 00:12:50,399
for loop in this

356
00:12:50,399 --> 00:12:52,800
so let's reload that we got url one two

357
00:12:52,800 --> 00:12:54,000
three a bunch of times or

358
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:57,519
urls several times here

359
00:12:57,519 --> 00:12:59,839
okay so we'll save that you'll see that

360
00:12:59,839 --> 00:13:01,519
we're iterating over those different

361
00:13:01,519 --> 00:13:02,399
things

362
00:13:02,399 --> 00:13:05,040
all right so let's just do a quick check

363
00:13:05,040 --> 00:13:07,040
and see what we've done here

364
00:13:07,040 --> 00:13:10,800
we've done this looked at data a little

365
00:13:10,800 --> 00:13:12,720
bit

366
00:13:12,720 --> 00:13:18,320
we have also talked about html fragments

367
00:13:18,320 --> 00:13:21,360
and my mouse is not working properly uh

368
00:13:21,360 --> 00:13:23,440
we tried unsuccessfully to do v

369
00:13:23,440 --> 00:13:24,480
conditionals

370
00:13:24,480 --> 00:13:26,560
but we'll get to that in just a minute

371
00:13:26,560 --> 00:13:29,360
um now let's look at how we bind

372
00:13:29,360 --> 00:13:31,680
this into data properties and how we use

373
00:13:31,680 --> 00:13:32,839
some more tag

374
00:13:32,839 --> 00:13:36,480
attributes okay so let's go and create

375
00:13:36,480 --> 00:13:40,480
a input field so what we'll say here

376
00:13:40,480 --> 00:13:44,959
is let's just create a simple input

377
00:13:44,959 --> 00:13:49,040
and say input and the input

378
00:13:49,040 --> 00:13:52,800
type will be text

379
00:13:52,880 --> 00:13:56,160
okay and

380
00:13:56,160 --> 00:13:59,600
we will use another directive called v

381
00:13:59,600 --> 00:14:01,040
dash model

382
00:14:01,040 --> 00:14:04,240
equals talk title

383
00:14:04,240 --> 00:14:06,720
in here

384
00:14:07,279 --> 00:14:10,399
okay there's our input and

385
00:14:10,399 --> 00:14:13,839
let's go and see if this shows up first

386
00:14:13,839 --> 00:14:15,839
before we add the data okay so now we

387
00:14:15,839 --> 00:14:19,279
have our input here

388
00:14:20,160 --> 00:14:23,440
all right now

389
00:14:23,440 --> 00:14:26,880
let's go and create

390
00:14:26,880 --> 00:14:30,240
data that maps that

391
00:14:30,240 --> 00:14:34,880
input so we said this is talk title

392
00:14:34,880 --> 00:14:36,000
and again what we're doing is we're

393
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:38,560
building out a form talk title

394
00:14:38,560 --> 00:14:40,240
and we'll just give it some placeholder

395
00:14:40,240 --> 00:14:41,920
here some title

396
00:14:41,920 --> 00:14:45,279
okay save reload

397
00:14:45,279 --> 00:14:50,399
and it helps if you surround

398
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:56,160
okay and format your html properly okay

399
00:14:56,160 --> 00:14:57,519
so here's some title now

400
00:14:57,519 --> 00:14:59,360
okay so you can see that it says some

401
00:14:59,360 --> 00:15:00,959
title and

402
00:15:00,959 --> 00:15:04,399
uh this is no fun let's go and actually

403
00:15:04,399 --> 00:15:07,279
show that talk title next to it

404
00:15:07,279 --> 00:15:10,959
let's insert a break here vr okay

405
00:15:10,959 --> 00:15:12,639
let's reload that and there's some some

406
00:15:12,639 --> 00:15:14,240
title again

407
00:15:14,240 --> 00:15:17,360
let's add a little bit more space right

408
00:15:17,360 --> 00:15:19,519
now you'll see as i come into this input

409
00:15:19,519 --> 00:15:20,720
field and

410
00:15:20,720 --> 00:15:24,399
i type something that

411
00:15:24,399 --> 00:15:27,279
we immediately see it echoed back when

412
00:15:27,279 --> 00:15:28,320
we use

413
00:15:28,320 --> 00:15:30,079
this directive to show it and i'm using

414
00:15:30,079 --> 00:15:31,600
a semantic director here but

415
00:15:31,600 --> 00:15:32,959
it doesn't have to be like that we could

416
00:15:32,959 --> 00:15:35,519
also do an h1 and say v

417
00:15:35,519 --> 00:15:39,199
text equals talk title

418
00:15:39,199 --> 00:15:41,199
and it will show it also same thing

419
00:15:41,199 --> 00:15:43,120
right so there's some title

420
00:15:43,120 --> 00:15:46,639
and i'm going to type something now and

421
00:15:46,639 --> 00:15:49,680
it goes and shows that like so okay

422
00:15:49,680 --> 00:15:53,680
so um what we're looking at here

423
00:15:53,680 --> 00:15:57,279
is what we call two-way data binding

424
00:15:57,279 --> 00:16:00,160
using v-model so bindings are two-way in

425
00:16:00,160 --> 00:16:01,120
react

426
00:16:01,120 --> 00:16:03,199
and we have just used the v-dash model

427
00:16:03,199 --> 00:16:05,600
which gives us that two-way data binding

428
00:16:05,600 --> 00:16:06,880
okay the other thing that you may have

429
00:16:06,880 --> 00:16:08,720
noticed is that the data process we've

430
00:16:08,720 --> 00:16:10,160
been using so far have just been

431
00:16:10,160 --> 00:16:11,120
primitives

432
00:16:11,120 --> 00:16:14,079
and so things like numbers strings etc

433
00:16:14,079 --> 00:16:15,759
can be used you can also use

434
00:16:15,759 --> 00:16:18,240
arrays but arrays of primitives can be

435
00:16:18,240 --> 00:16:19,920
used as data properties

436
00:16:19,920 --> 00:16:21,920
okay we also covered p dash loops

437
00:16:21,920 --> 00:16:23,279
earlier so

438
00:16:23,279 --> 00:16:24,560
we've done that we're making some good

439
00:16:24,560 --> 00:16:26,720
headway here

440
00:16:26,720 --> 00:16:28,320
and let's go look at some more

441
00:16:28,320 --> 00:16:30,320
directives just a second

442
00:16:30,320 --> 00:16:32,800
okay so let's go and refactor this

443
00:16:32,800 --> 00:16:34,079
application

444
00:16:34,079 --> 00:16:37,360
and we have this right here

445
00:16:37,360 --> 00:16:39,199
and let's go and add a little bit of

446
00:16:39,199 --> 00:16:40,880
extra stuff around it and say

447
00:16:40,880 --> 00:16:46,079
h1 is

448
00:16:46,720 --> 00:16:50,160
talk title okay so we've said

449
00:16:50,160 --> 00:16:54,079
uh v dash uh we added talk title

450
00:16:54,079 --> 00:16:56,160
here and that's some title which is this

451
00:16:56,160 --> 00:16:57,839
thing right here

452
00:16:57,839 --> 00:17:00,880
right oops hit the wrong button here

453
00:17:00,880 --> 00:17:02,480
okay so let's see if we can use some

454
00:17:02,480 --> 00:17:04,640
more directives here

455
00:17:04,640 --> 00:17:06,319
what if there's a bit of data that we

456
00:17:06,319 --> 00:17:07,679
only want to render

457
00:17:07,679 --> 00:17:10,880
once okay let's save that

458
00:17:10,880 --> 00:17:14,480
let's reload it and let's go change this

459
00:17:14,480 --> 00:17:15,439
now

460
00:17:15,439 --> 00:17:18,720
and you'll see that this

461
00:17:18,720 --> 00:17:20,720
expression right here or let's actually

462
00:17:20,720 --> 00:17:23,119
simplify this let's use the same thing

463
00:17:23,119 --> 00:17:25,359
both with v dash once and without v dash

464
00:17:25,359 --> 00:17:27,599
once so that you can see

465
00:17:27,599 --> 00:17:29,440
exactly what's going on okay so let's

466
00:17:29,440 --> 00:17:30,799
save and reload that

467
00:17:30,799 --> 00:17:32,720
so you can see we have some title here

468
00:17:32,720 --> 00:17:34,160
and i'm going to say i'm going to

469
00:17:34,160 --> 00:17:37,200
change the title and only

470
00:17:37,200 --> 00:17:39,200
this one changes but not this one that

471
00:17:39,200 --> 00:17:40,880
has v dash once

472
00:17:40,880 --> 00:17:42,400
and the reason why that we want to use

473
00:17:42,400 --> 00:17:44,559
the v dash once in some places

474
00:17:44,559 --> 00:17:47,200
is that once we mark something as being

475
00:17:47,200 --> 00:17:48,000
only

476
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:51,679
able to be used once that means that

477
00:17:51,679 --> 00:17:54,960
it will not change again and what

478
00:17:54,960 --> 00:17:57,039
vue does underneath the hood is that it

479
00:17:57,039 --> 00:17:59,679
removes the reactivity portion

480
00:17:59,679 --> 00:18:03,280
for that specific data property to

481
00:18:03,280 --> 00:18:06,720
lower the overall overhead of that view

482
00:18:06,720 --> 00:18:09,120
application so that leads to faster

483
00:18:09,120 --> 00:18:10,880
overall runtime performance or if you

484
00:18:10,880 --> 00:18:12,240
just don't want something to change

485
00:18:12,240 --> 00:18:14,160
right so their main reason we want to

486
00:18:14,160 --> 00:18:15,760
use it is we never want this thing to

487
00:18:15,760 --> 00:18:16,160
change

488
00:18:16,160 --> 00:18:18,799
once it's been rendered and it helps us

489
00:18:18,799 --> 00:18:20,480
save a little bit of performance by

490
00:18:20,480 --> 00:18:22,240
using v dash once when we do something

491
00:18:22,240 --> 00:18:23,039
like that

492
00:18:23,039 --> 00:18:24,960
okay so we've looked at a couple of

493
00:18:24,960 --> 00:18:26,240
directives here

494
00:18:26,240 --> 00:18:29,600
now how do we go and actually

495
00:18:29,600 --> 00:18:32,080
uh capture events so that it does

496
00:18:32,080 --> 00:18:32,960
something

497
00:18:32,960 --> 00:18:36,400
okay let's go and uh let's create a

498
00:18:36,400 --> 00:18:39,679
quick button somewhere so um

499
00:18:39,679 --> 00:18:43,520
how about we say

500
00:18:43,520 --> 00:18:48,160
uh okay so let's go here and let's

501
00:18:48,160 --> 00:18:51,480
just create a input type

502
00:18:51,480 --> 00:18:55,679
input type of

503
00:18:55,679 --> 00:18:58,320
type equals maybe submit right some kind

504
00:18:58,320 --> 00:19:00,160
of submit button

505
00:19:00,160 --> 00:19:04,240
and then value equals submit

506
00:19:04,240 --> 00:19:06,559
okay oops i got my thing on the wrong

507
00:19:06,559 --> 00:19:08,240
side let's reload this

508
00:19:08,240 --> 00:19:09,840
there's our submit button doesn't do

509
00:19:09,840 --> 00:19:12,559
anything and then let's create

510
00:19:12,559 --> 00:19:15,679
a handler for this and we will say

511
00:19:15,679 --> 00:19:19,440
v dash on colon click

512
00:19:19,440 --> 00:19:23,280
equals submit

513
00:19:23,280 --> 00:19:27,039
clicked all right so now

514
00:19:27,039 --> 00:19:29,600
let's go and actually try to do

515
00:19:29,600 --> 00:19:31,039
something with this

516
00:19:31,039 --> 00:19:34,240
uh in some way so let's go

517
00:19:34,240 --> 00:19:38,160
and go into here

518
00:19:38,160 --> 00:19:41,679
and method

519
00:19:42,720 --> 00:19:46,080
cohen submit click

520
00:19:46,080 --> 00:19:49,840
function alert

521
00:19:49,840 --> 00:19:51,440
let's see if this works i haven't done

522
00:19:51,440 --> 00:19:53,200
this in a while but we'll find out if it

523
00:19:53,200 --> 00:19:55,520
works okay so let's reload that

524
00:19:55,520 --> 00:19:57,760
we hit submit and you can see that we

525
00:19:57,760 --> 00:19:59,600
get a little pop-up that says hello

526
00:19:59,600 --> 00:20:01,039
so what have we done here let's examine

527
00:20:01,039 --> 00:20:02,640
this a little bit closely

528
00:20:02,640 --> 00:20:06,000
we said v dash on click so when we get

529
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:08,799
a click on a click event invoke this

530
00:20:08,799 --> 00:20:09,840
submit click

531
00:20:09,840 --> 00:20:12,720
and as you see we added a new fragment

532
00:20:12,720 --> 00:20:13,520
here

533
00:20:13,520 --> 00:20:15,440
inside of our view app declaration

534
00:20:15,440 --> 00:20:17,120
called methods and we created a new

535
00:20:17,120 --> 00:20:18,000
function

536
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:21,440
called submit click which maps to this

537
00:20:21,440 --> 00:20:22,640
thing right here

538
00:20:22,640 --> 00:20:25,520
and we simply go and uh issued an alert

539
00:20:25,520 --> 00:20:27,120
so if i click this again you'll see that

540
00:20:27,120 --> 00:20:29,120
what that does but we can also go and

541
00:20:29,120 --> 00:20:30,159
change the data

542
00:20:30,159 --> 00:20:32,320
right so we have this data for talk

543
00:20:32,320 --> 00:20:34,000
title right which is this

544
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:36,880
thing right here and let's get rid of

545
00:20:36,880 --> 00:20:38,960
this for now

546
00:20:38,960 --> 00:20:42,000
all right let's simplify our application

547
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:43,919
okay so we have talk title let's see if

548
00:20:43,919 --> 00:20:46,000
we can go and manipulate this talk title

549
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:48,960
directly so we'll say

550
00:20:48,960 --> 00:20:52,400
this dot talk title equals you click

551
00:20:52,400 --> 00:20:54,400
the button let's see if this works let's

552
00:20:54,400 --> 00:20:55,600
reload this

553
00:20:55,600 --> 00:20:57,520
and then when we click the submit button

554
00:20:57,520 --> 00:20:59,200
you can see that we access the talk

555
00:20:59,200 --> 00:21:00,320
title

556
00:21:00,320 --> 00:21:03,919
and then we go and change the value of

557
00:21:03,919 --> 00:21:04,799
that

558
00:21:04,799 --> 00:21:07,200
to say you click the button right

559
00:21:07,200 --> 00:21:09,360
relatively straightforward

560
00:21:09,360 --> 00:21:11,360
so let's get back to our outline real

561
00:21:11,360 --> 00:21:13,520
quick so we captured some events

562
00:21:13,520 --> 00:21:17,039
with b click and we can

563
00:21:17,039 --> 00:21:18,480
also talk a little bit more about

564
00:21:18,480 --> 00:21:20,080
expressions which we tried to do let's

565
00:21:20,080 --> 00:21:21,520
see if we can fix

566
00:21:21,520 --> 00:21:24,559
um what we did wrong with

567
00:21:24,559 --> 00:21:27,919
the property here

568
00:21:27,919 --> 00:21:30,960
okay so let's go here

569
00:21:30,960 --> 00:21:33,440
and uh let's just say the time of day is

570
00:21:33,440 --> 00:21:34,080
just 12.

571
00:21:34,080 --> 00:21:35,840
okay instead of trying to return a

572
00:21:35,840 --> 00:21:38,480
function here

573
00:21:39,200 --> 00:21:41,600
okay so let's add in our v dash if we'll

574
00:21:41,600 --> 00:21:42,880
say

575
00:21:42,880 --> 00:21:47,200
h1 b dash if equals

576
00:21:47,200 --> 00:21:50,400
and we call this thing time of day time

577
00:21:50,400 --> 00:21:53,919
of day is greater than 12

578
00:21:54,559 --> 00:21:58,080
time of day time of

579
00:21:58,080 --> 00:22:02,400
time of day is greater

580
00:22:02,400 --> 00:22:06,080
than 12. you have to excuse my uh

581
00:22:06,080 --> 00:22:08,400
bad typing here okay so we didn't get

582
00:22:08,400 --> 00:22:09,280
there

583
00:22:09,280 --> 00:22:12,640
now if we go and say this time of days

584
00:22:12,640 --> 00:22:15,840
try 10. right there we go now we got to

585
00:22:15,840 --> 00:22:16,559
work

586
00:22:16,559 --> 00:22:19,679
okay so what we did

587
00:22:19,679 --> 00:22:21,520
is uh i had a function here previously

588
00:22:21,520 --> 00:22:22,880
that does work but i did something a

589
00:22:22,880 --> 00:22:24,240
little bit wrong but you can see

590
00:22:24,240 --> 00:22:26,640
how i fixed this i just said time of day

591
00:22:26,640 --> 00:22:28,080
is integer 12

592
00:22:28,080 --> 00:22:30,880
and then i say v dash if if time of day

593
00:22:30,880 --> 00:22:31,840
is greater than

594
00:22:31,840 --> 00:22:34,080
10 then go and show this thing and of

595
00:22:34,080 --> 00:22:36,320
course if i change this to 15

596
00:22:36,320 --> 00:22:38,559
i save and i hit reload you'll see that

597
00:22:38,559 --> 00:22:40,159
that thing is gone now okay so there's

598
00:22:40,159 --> 00:22:41,280
our v dash if

599
00:22:41,280 --> 00:22:42,880
and what we did here is we used an

600
00:22:42,880 --> 00:22:44,320
expression inside

601
00:22:44,320 --> 00:22:47,440
of our view template okay so a couple of

602
00:22:47,440 --> 00:22:48,559
different things that we

603
00:22:48,559 --> 00:22:50,559
haven't really covered in much detail in

604
00:22:50,559 --> 00:22:52,320
the overall structure of review

605
00:22:52,320 --> 00:22:55,200
application or view component is what we

606
00:22:55,200 --> 00:22:55,840
have here

607
00:22:55,840 --> 00:22:58,880
inside the html is our view template and

608
00:22:58,880 --> 00:23:01,200
inside of here is our view application

609
00:23:01,200 --> 00:23:02,880
with the sections for data

610
00:23:02,880 --> 00:23:04,880
and methods and other things like that

611
00:23:04,880 --> 00:23:06,000
all right so

612
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:09,360
we've covered some of the uh

613
00:23:09,360 --> 00:23:12,559
basic stuff here and

614
00:23:12,559 --> 00:23:16,799
what we can do is uh have a look at some

615
00:23:16,799 --> 00:23:18,240
something a little bit more elaborate

616
00:23:18,240 --> 00:23:19,679
let's just double check our outline to

617
00:23:19,679 --> 00:23:21,280
see if we've covered everything which we

618
00:23:21,280 --> 00:23:23,280
have very quickly of course since this

619
00:23:23,280 --> 00:23:23,760
is a

620
00:23:23,760 --> 00:23:26,240
short session let's see how we do a

621
00:23:26,240 --> 00:23:27,440
network call now

622
00:23:27,440 --> 00:23:28,720
so i'm going to switch to a separate

623
00:23:28,720 --> 00:23:30,480
project and

624
00:23:30,480 --> 00:23:33,440
look at this view application and this

625
00:23:33,440 --> 00:23:35,200
one is a more real world view

626
00:23:35,200 --> 00:23:36,320
application

627
00:23:36,320 --> 00:23:39,360
this has as you can see has a bunch of

628
00:23:39,360 --> 00:23:41,039
different folders it's got a components

629
00:23:41,039 --> 00:23:43,120
folder data layouts middleware et cetera

630
00:23:43,120 --> 00:23:44,000
pages

631
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:46,559
this is a nox.js application and next

632
00:23:46,559 --> 00:23:48,240
again is a framework

633
00:23:48,240 --> 00:23:51,520
that sits underneath view or i should

634
00:23:51,520 --> 00:23:52,640
say on top of you

635
00:23:52,640 --> 00:23:54,720
that allows you to build out a more

636
00:23:54,720 --> 00:23:56,559
comprehensive website and gives you lots

637
00:23:56,559 --> 00:23:57,520
of little

638
00:23:57,520 --> 00:23:59,760
tools to help you build out an app and

639
00:23:59,760 --> 00:24:01,279
the specific component that i'm looking

640
00:24:01,279 --> 00:24:03,039
at the show article here

641
00:24:03,039 --> 00:24:05,760
and you can see i have a v if and i have

642
00:24:05,760 --> 00:24:08,720
this separate article thing here

643
00:24:08,720 --> 00:24:12,720
which is a standard html tag

644
00:24:12,720 --> 00:24:15,919
and i say if this thing is not loading

645
00:24:15,919 --> 00:24:18,960
then basically don't uh

646
00:24:18,960 --> 00:24:21,760
don't show the content okay so right

647
00:24:21,760 --> 00:24:23,760
here i have loading set to true

648
00:24:23,760 --> 00:24:25,120
so that means this won't be shown

649
00:24:25,120 --> 00:24:27,200
initially and then my vhtml is this

650
00:24:27,200 --> 00:24:27,919
content

651
00:24:27,919 --> 00:24:29,520
now what i want to do is i want to make

652
00:24:29,520 --> 00:24:31,279
a network call and go and inject some

653
00:24:31,279 --> 00:24:32,960
content into here let's go and pull this

654
00:24:32,960 --> 00:24:34,000
up actually

655
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:35,440
so you can see what's going on this is a

656
00:24:35,440 --> 00:24:36,880
little website i've been working on for

657
00:24:36,880 --> 00:24:39,120
a little while called the java cafe

658
00:24:39,120 --> 00:24:42,080
written in bjs

659
00:24:42,240 --> 00:24:44,240
and what i'm going to do is i'm going to

660
00:24:44,240 --> 00:24:45,760
reload this page and if you watch right

661
00:24:45,760 --> 00:24:46,000
here

662
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:48,240
where my mouse is you'll see that for a

663
00:24:48,240 --> 00:24:49,039
split second

664
00:24:49,039 --> 00:24:51,360
it will say loading article please wait

665
00:24:51,360 --> 00:24:52,640
and then it will get filled in

666
00:24:52,640 --> 00:24:54,720
okay so let's reload that and you'll see

667
00:24:54,720 --> 00:24:56,320
it says loading article please wait and

668
00:24:56,320 --> 00:24:58,159
then boom our content shows up

669
00:24:58,159 --> 00:25:00,080
so where is that content coming from

670
00:25:00,080 --> 00:25:01,600
let's look at the network call that

671
00:25:01,600 --> 00:25:04,320
we're making here to make this happen

672
00:25:04,320 --> 00:25:07,840
all right so first thing

673
00:25:07,840 --> 00:25:09,679
i want to talk about quickly here is

674
00:25:09,679 --> 00:25:10,960
that i'm using a few

675
00:25:10,960 --> 00:25:14,080
of the view lifecycle hooks

676
00:25:14,080 --> 00:25:16,080
i'm not using created and i'm not using

677
00:25:16,080 --> 00:25:17,440
updated i just have those in for

678
00:25:17,440 --> 00:25:19,440
demonstration purposes i'm specifically

679
00:25:19,440 --> 00:25:20,080
using

680
00:25:20,080 --> 00:25:22,320
the mounted lifecycle hook which says

681
00:25:22,320 --> 00:25:24,240
when this view component

682
00:25:24,240 --> 00:25:26,559
and again i'm not not a single page view

683
00:25:26,559 --> 00:25:28,320
application or not a single component

684
00:25:28,320 --> 00:25:29,679
view app anymore like we were seeing

685
00:25:29,679 --> 00:25:30,480
before

686
00:25:30,480 --> 00:25:33,840
this is a multiple component with pages

687
00:25:33,840 --> 00:25:35,279
and other things like that so i'm using

688
00:25:35,279 --> 00:25:36,559
components in here

689
00:25:36,559 --> 00:25:38,640
and this is a single view component

690
00:25:38,640 --> 00:25:40,840
called show article

691
00:25:40,840 --> 00:25:45,279
okay and

692
00:25:45,279 --> 00:25:47,440
what i'm doing is i'm saying i'm going

693
00:25:47,440 --> 00:25:48,640
to call this thing

694
00:25:48,640 --> 00:25:52,960
which is the ascii.html converter

695
00:25:52,960 --> 00:25:56,000
and i'm using the axios library in

696
00:25:56,000 --> 00:25:59,600
here okay so you can see if we look at

697
00:25:59,600 --> 00:26:01,279
this specific part right here and again

698
00:26:01,279 --> 00:26:02,400
you can see we're using an

699
00:26:02,400 --> 00:26:05,520
async a weight so this mounted lifecycle

700
00:26:05,520 --> 00:26:06,000
hook

701
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:08,320
i have tagged with async and it will

702
00:26:08,320 --> 00:26:09,279
await

703
00:26:09,279 --> 00:26:12,720
for this axios call to

704
00:26:12,720 --> 00:26:14,960
execute and return axios is a library

705
00:26:14,960 --> 00:26:16,159
that you use to

706
00:26:16,159 --> 00:26:18,720
inside of javascript to go and make

707
00:26:18,720 --> 00:26:21,120
network calls and i say axios

708
00:26:21,120 --> 00:26:25,919
do a get call against this specific url

709
00:26:25,919 --> 00:26:28,080
or this specific variable that variable

710
00:26:28,080 --> 00:26:30,960
is essentially this cloud function

711
00:26:30,960 --> 00:26:33,760
right here that i've written which is a

712
00:26:33,760 --> 00:26:35,919
simple ascii.html

713
00:26:35,919 --> 00:26:38,159
converter okay so it's got a a doc

714
00:26:38,159 --> 00:26:39,039
source url

715
00:26:39,039 --> 00:26:40,880
at the end of it so basically you pass

716
00:26:40,880 --> 00:26:42,720
in some raw ascii dock and it converts

717
00:26:42,720 --> 00:26:44,000
it to html

718
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:45,840
let's have a quick look at that again

719
00:26:45,840 --> 00:26:47,360
all right so this is our ascii dock

720
00:26:47,360 --> 00:26:49,039
right here

721
00:26:49,039 --> 00:26:52,000
right so if i go and reload this again

722
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:53,039
you'll see it'll say

723
00:26:53,039 --> 00:26:56,080
loading article and then when it has

724
00:26:56,080 --> 00:26:57,440
gone and done the conversion

725
00:26:57,440 --> 00:26:59,520
using that serverless cloud function it

726
00:26:59,520 --> 00:27:01,279
goes and executes

727
00:27:01,279 --> 00:27:04,960
and i have the example of

728
00:27:04,960 --> 00:27:06,720
this cloud function right here so again

729
00:27:06,720 --> 00:27:08,640
this is a simple serverless cloud

730
00:27:08,640 --> 00:27:09,360
function

731
00:27:09,360 --> 00:27:11,679
running on ibm cloud functions which is

732
00:27:11,679 --> 00:27:14,000
based on apache openwhisk

733
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:16,880
and if we go look at the source code for

734
00:27:16,880 --> 00:27:19,120
that cloud function it's not

735
00:27:19,120 --> 00:27:21,120
not too terribly exciting i use the

736
00:27:21,120 --> 00:27:23,440
ascii doctor js library

737
00:27:23,440 --> 00:27:25,440
and then i use a request and request

738
00:27:25,440 --> 00:27:26,480
promise lib

739
00:27:26,480 --> 00:27:28,559
and i essentially call right here in the

740
00:27:28,559 --> 00:27:31,919
middle i say go and get

741
00:27:31,919 --> 00:27:35,360
the ascii doc library go and fetch the

742
00:27:35,360 --> 00:27:36,080
contents

743
00:27:36,080 --> 00:27:38,399
once you have them and then return the

744
00:27:38,399 --> 00:27:40,799
body as that converted html

745
00:27:40,799 --> 00:27:42,320
so what i've done is i've essentially

746
00:27:42,320 --> 00:27:44,559
used a cloud function to go

747
00:27:44,559 --> 00:27:47,279
and do this conversion from ascii doc

748
00:27:47,279 --> 00:27:48,399
into html

749
00:27:48,399 --> 00:27:51,440
and then injected it into my view

750
00:27:51,440 --> 00:27:55,200
application directly inside of

751
00:27:55,200 --> 00:27:58,320
this component okay all right so let's

752
00:27:58,320 --> 00:27:59,679
make sure that we've covered everything

753
00:27:59,679 --> 00:28:00,720
real quick

754
00:28:00,720 --> 00:28:03,760
and so we talked about going and

755
00:28:03,760 --> 00:28:06,559
running uh using axios i'll show that

756
00:28:06,559 --> 00:28:08,159
again in just a second

757
00:28:08,159 --> 00:28:10,159
how we hooked into a life cycle event to

758
00:28:10,159 --> 00:28:12,799
do an update after we fetched some data

759
00:28:12,799 --> 00:28:15,200
and calling a serverless backend we

760
00:28:15,200 --> 00:28:17,039
showed that very quickly

761
00:28:17,039 --> 00:28:19,039
so again let's go and look at our view

762
00:28:19,039 --> 00:28:21,279
application

763
00:28:21,279 --> 00:28:24,159
okay here's my template i say if it's

764
00:28:24,159 --> 00:28:25,200
not loading

765
00:28:25,200 --> 00:28:27,840
don't show anything when loading flips

766
00:28:27,840 --> 00:28:29,279
to false

767
00:28:29,279 --> 00:28:31,120
this will become true and we will show

768
00:28:31,120 --> 00:28:34,559
the v html which is in the content

769
00:28:34,559 --> 00:28:36,320
you can see i have my content variable

770
00:28:36,320 --> 00:28:39,200
and my loading variable both set here

771
00:28:39,200 --> 00:28:42,799
i use the view life cycle

772
00:28:42,799 --> 00:28:45,840
hook for mounted so when the component

773
00:28:45,840 --> 00:28:47,039
gets mounted

774
00:28:47,039 --> 00:28:49,120
this the stuff that's in here will get

775
00:28:49,120 --> 00:28:50,399
fired

776
00:28:50,399 --> 00:28:55,120
and i say go and use axios make a http

777
00:28:55,120 --> 00:28:59,520
get call to this ibm cloud function

778
00:28:59,520 --> 00:29:02,720
which has an ascii doc source url

779
00:29:02,720 --> 00:29:04,080
the cloud function which i briefly

780
00:29:04,080 --> 00:29:06,080
showed goes and grabs it converts it to

781
00:29:06,080 --> 00:29:07,039
html

782
00:29:07,039 --> 00:29:09,360
and returns it into this application

783
00:29:09,360 --> 00:29:12,080
then we set loading equal to false

784
00:29:12,080 --> 00:29:14,799
that triggers this b dash if to show

785
00:29:14,799 --> 00:29:15,760
this thing

786
00:29:15,760 --> 00:29:18,880
and of course we set the content as the

787
00:29:18,880 --> 00:29:20,320
raw html

788
00:29:20,320 --> 00:29:23,360
from that return source okay

789
00:29:23,360 --> 00:29:27,039
so um we have a couple of minutes

790
00:29:27,039 --> 00:29:30,159
left and i want to stop here and take

791
00:29:30,159 --> 00:29:33,520
any questions to make sure that i have

792
00:29:33,520 --> 00:29:34,480
at least given you

793
00:29:34,480 --> 00:29:37,520
a chance to ask some questions okay all

794
00:29:37,520 --> 00:29:40,320
right so first of all happy birthday

795
00:29:40,320 --> 00:29:44,480
oh thanks man um great to be 29 again

796
00:29:44,480 --> 00:29:46,240
all right there's a there's a couple

797
00:29:46,240 --> 00:29:48,159
questions one is

798
00:29:48,159 --> 00:29:50,320
uh let's the issue you couldn't figure

799
00:29:50,320 --> 00:29:51,760
out one of the people in slack actually

800
00:29:51,760 --> 00:29:52,960
figured out for you

801
00:29:52,960 --> 00:29:55,039
so the time of day call right when

802
00:29:55,039 --> 00:29:57,360
you're trying to get that from data

803
00:29:57,360 --> 00:29:59,360
if you yeah yeah yeah if you added

804
00:29:59,360 --> 00:30:01,200
parentheses on the end of it

805
00:30:01,200 --> 00:30:05,360
in the expression then it works

806
00:30:05,360 --> 00:30:07,360
right so what you're saying is if i did

807
00:30:07,360 --> 00:30:08,480
um

808
00:30:08,480 --> 00:30:11,120
basically that no no on the expression

809
00:30:11,120 --> 00:30:12,799
so leave that like it is take off the

810
00:30:12,799 --> 00:30:14,399
parentheses there

811
00:30:14,399 --> 00:30:16,240
all right right right right i got you

812
00:30:16,240 --> 00:30:17,760
yup yup you're right you're in there

813
00:30:17,760 --> 00:30:18,159
right

814
00:30:18,159 --> 00:30:21,039
like that okay that's right so so let me

815
00:30:21,039 --> 00:30:22,399
talk about that for just a second the

816
00:30:22,399 --> 00:30:24,480
reason why i modeled this initially as a

817
00:30:24,480 --> 00:30:25,360
function

818
00:30:25,360 --> 00:30:26,880
is because when you write this as

819
00:30:26,880 --> 00:30:29,360
components sometimes what you want to do

820
00:30:29,360 --> 00:30:30,799
is you want to get an instance

821
00:30:30,799 --> 00:30:32,880
of that data so that it's not stacked

822
00:30:32,880 --> 00:30:34,399
right so then it becomes basically

823
00:30:34,399 --> 00:30:36,559
unique to that component but anyways

824
00:30:36,559 --> 00:30:38,720
we can move on to the next question okay

825
00:30:38,720 --> 00:30:39,840
so the next question

826
00:30:39,840 --> 00:30:42,159
is does the view life cycle event tied

827
00:30:42,159 --> 00:30:44,159
to a specific component of view like

828
00:30:44,159 --> 00:30:46,640
in react if so how are components

829
00:30:46,640 --> 00:30:48,799
registered with view

830
00:30:48,799 --> 00:30:51,840
okay so so that's a great question um

831
00:30:51,840 --> 00:30:54,399
let's go back to that uh more complete

832
00:30:54,399 --> 00:30:55,679
example here

833
00:30:55,679 --> 00:30:58,880
and so so a view component uh

834
00:30:58,880 --> 00:31:00,480
when you create a view component

835
00:31:00,480 --> 00:31:02,559
instance you get a true instance

836
00:31:02,559 --> 00:31:07,039
and these life cycle hooks here are

837
00:31:07,039 --> 00:31:10,960
in in encased inside of that specific

838
00:31:10,960 --> 00:31:13,440
instance so these are if so every time

839
00:31:13,440 --> 00:31:14,960
you create a view component and

840
00:31:14,960 --> 00:31:16,960
it has its own unique created mounted

841
00:31:16,960 --> 00:31:19,360
updated etc hooks inside of it so the

842
00:31:19,360 --> 00:31:20,720
components are independent

843
00:31:20,720 --> 00:31:23,600
but if we go and look to see where this

844
00:31:23,600 --> 00:31:25,600
show article

845
00:31:25,600 --> 00:31:28,240
and i'm just going to do this because i

846
00:31:28,240 --> 00:31:29,600
want to

847
00:31:29,600 --> 00:31:32,720
make it a little bit clearer uh how that

848
00:31:32,720 --> 00:31:35,360
gets shown is like so right so you can

849
00:31:35,360 --> 00:31:36,480
see i have

850
00:31:36,480 --> 00:31:38,559
a vcard component and then that show

851
00:31:38,559 --> 00:31:40,559
article that we were just looking at

852
00:31:40,559 --> 00:31:42,720
is a component that gets created an

853
00:31:42,720 --> 00:31:44,720
instance of it gets created here

854
00:31:44,720 --> 00:31:46,159
you can see this is where i pass in the

855
00:31:46,159 --> 00:31:47,760
article source

856
00:31:47,760 --> 00:31:50,320
and then i import show article like so

857
00:31:50,320 --> 00:31:51,919
to use that component

858
00:31:51,919 --> 00:31:54,960
and then i basically list out those

859
00:31:54,960 --> 00:31:55,760
components

860
00:31:55,760 --> 00:31:58,799
inside of the parent component

861
00:31:58,799 --> 00:32:01,519
in this case the just the article um

862
00:32:01,519 --> 00:32:02,559
page

863
00:32:02,559 --> 00:32:05,120
uh which is modeled as a component also

864
00:32:05,120 --> 00:32:05,840
right so

865
00:32:05,840 --> 00:32:08,559
here's my article page component which

866
00:32:08,559 --> 00:32:10,799
uses the show article subcomponent

867
00:32:10,799 --> 00:32:12,559
like so okay i think i answered the

868
00:32:12,559 --> 00:32:14,240
question but i'm not sure yep

869
00:32:14,240 --> 00:32:15,919
and we're over time but we have a coffee

870
00:32:15,919 --> 00:32:17,679
break for 15 minutes so i'm just going

871
00:32:17,679 --> 00:32:18,480
to ask you

872
00:32:18,480 --> 00:32:20,559
lauren maybe we'll stop in like four

873
00:32:20,559 --> 00:32:22,640
minutes so uh what is the difference

874
00:32:22,640 --> 00:32:23,360
between

875
00:32:23,360 --> 00:32:25,600
the data and the methods properties of a

876
00:32:25,600 --> 00:32:27,679
view object

877
00:32:27,679 --> 00:32:29,279
right so that's a that's a great

878
00:32:29,279 --> 00:32:31,279
question too let's flip back to

879
00:32:31,279 --> 00:32:34,480
our uh sample app here right so some

880
00:32:34,480 --> 00:32:35,120
methods

881
00:32:35,120 --> 00:32:38,399
are where we put i'm going to state the

882
00:32:38,399 --> 00:32:39,440
obvious here first

883
00:32:39,440 --> 00:32:42,880
and then answer it in more detail the

884
00:32:42,880 --> 00:32:45,840
methods are where we put things that we

885
00:32:45,840 --> 00:32:47,600
want to execute inside

886
00:32:47,600 --> 00:32:50,159
of our view component right so that's

887
00:32:50,159 --> 00:32:53,039
like for example submit click

888
00:32:53,039 --> 00:32:56,480
data is a special container

889
00:32:56,480 --> 00:32:59,840
for where we put the properties for

890
00:32:59,840 --> 00:33:02,559
our components right essentially that's

891
00:33:02,559 --> 00:33:04,559
where we have the schema

892
00:33:04,559 --> 00:33:07,120
at build time for our component i

893
00:33:07,120 --> 00:33:08,480
actually have a nice slide on this so

894
00:33:08,480 --> 00:33:10,559
let me go find that real quick so

895
00:33:10,559 --> 00:33:13,760
as i'm talking over this it will become

896
00:33:13,760 --> 00:33:16,080
a little bit more apparent what i'm

897
00:33:16,080 --> 00:33:17,120
trying to get at

898
00:33:17,120 --> 00:33:20,159
if i can find it um

899
00:33:20,159 --> 00:33:22,399
maybe not there we go all right so we

900
00:33:22,399 --> 00:33:24,159
were talking about forms and models

901
00:33:24,159 --> 00:33:27,519
um so so the data essentially is

902
00:33:27,519 --> 00:33:31,279
how we go and model the schema for our

903
00:33:31,279 --> 00:33:34,240
for our application at dev time and then

904
00:33:34,240 --> 00:33:35,120
at runtime

905
00:33:35,120 --> 00:33:38,159
the data becomes our model so

906
00:33:38,159 --> 00:33:41,679
the the difference is that

907
00:33:41,679 --> 00:33:44,000
the methods only contain things which we

908
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:45,840
would refer to as things which are

909
00:33:45,840 --> 00:33:48,000
actions or functions that do things

910
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:51,519
and our data is locked into place

911
00:33:51,519 --> 00:33:53,919
when the component becomes instantiated

912
00:33:53,919 --> 00:33:55,039
so for example

913
00:33:55,039 --> 00:33:58,399
what that means is at runtime i can't do

914
00:33:58,399 --> 00:33:59,360
something like this

915
00:33:59,360 --> 00:34:01,200
i can't i'm just going to i'm just going

916
00:34:01,200 --> 00:34:02,799
to use this as in you know this is

917
00:34:02,799 --> 00:34:04,080
probably not the right place to put it

918
00:34:04,080 --> 00:34:06,320
but i'm just going to use this method

919
00:34:06,320 --> 00:34:07,279
here

920
00:34:07,279 --> 00:34:10,239
to show you what i mean okay so you can

921
00:34:10,239 --> 00:34:12,399
see i did this dot talk title

922
00:34:12,399 --> 00:34:14,560
and that's our data right if if we were

923
00:34:14,560 --> 00:34:16,239
able to get access

924
00:34:16,239 --> 00:34:19,199
into the um the overall data object

925
00:34:19,199 --> 00:34:20,560
which you can't do it like this again

926
00:34:20,560 --> 00:34:22,000
this is just like pseudocode for

927
00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:23,679
explanation purposes

928
00:34:23,679 --> 00:34:27,599
i can't go and say add new

929
00:34:27,599 --> 00:34:30,480
data property like so this is not

930
00:34:30,480 --> 00:34:32,399
allowed to do something like this

931
00:34:32,399 --> 00:34:36,000
so the data fragment or the data portion

932
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:37,440
of your view component gets

933
00:34:37,440 --> 00:34:39,760
locked when that component is

934
00:34:39,760 --> 00:34:42,079
instantiated and you cannot dynamically

935
00:34:42,079 --> 00:34:45,679
add or remove anything from the data

936
00:34:45,679 --> 00:34:48,239
you can change data components in here

937
00:34:48,239 --> 00:34:49,918
as you saw like you saw that we changed

938
00:34:49,918 --> 00:34:51,359
the talk title here

939
00:34:51,359 --> 00:34:52,879
and then you know we changed the

940
00:34:52,879 --> 00:34:54,320
greeting and things like that but the

941
00:34:54,320 --> 00:34:55,839
data basically

942
00:34:55,839 --> 00:34:58,640
as i showed in this slide is the schema

943
00:34:58,640 --> 00:35:00,079
and that runtime becomes the model and

944
00:35:00,079 --> 00:35:01,280
can't change

945
00:35:01,280 --> 00:35:02,640
and if that's not where you have the

946
00:35:02,640 --> 00:35:04,079
actions you put your actions into the

947
00:35:04,079 --> 00:35:04,640
methods

948
00:35:04,640 --> 00:35:07,440
so okay cool so there are a couple of

949
00:35:07,440 --> 00:35:08,640
other questions but i want to give

950
00:35:08,640 --> 00:35:09,200
people

951
00:35:09,200 --> 00:35:10,720
time to take a break so if you want to

952
00:35:10,720 --> 00:35:13,119
answer those and black under the track

953
00:35:13,119 --> 00:35:16,160
javascript channel then yep i'm in there

954
00:35:16,160 --> 00:35:18,240
all right well thanks for coming yep

955
00:35:18,240 --> 00:35:22,879
thanks y'all
