1
00:00:00,480 --> 00:00:03,040
uh everybody steve

2
00:00:03,040 --> 00:00:06,319
is gonna take it over from here steve

3
00:00:06,319 --> 00:00:09,200
learn us something

4
00:00:09,360 --> 00:00:11,200
thanks jeff for the great introduction

5
00:00:11,200 --> 00:00:12,960
um very uh

6
00:00:12,960 --> 00:00:15,440
very humbled to be following jessica i'm

7
00:00:15,440 --> 00:00:16,640
a huge fan

8
00:00:16,640 --> 00:00:18,640
i first saw her speak at devops

9
00:00:18,640 --> 00:00:20,000
enterprise in 2014

10
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:22,960
so it's been a long road since then but

11
00:00:22,960 --> 00:00:23,600
uh

12
00:00:23,600 --> 00:00:26,080
i i base a lot of what i do on those

13
00:00:26,080 --> 00:00:27,840
early experiences so

14
00:00:27,840 --> 00:00:30,000
she's a big hero of mine and the rest of

15
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,558
the lineup is just amazing so

16
00:00:32,558 --> 00:00:35,360
i'm going to share my screen and

17
00:00:35,360 --> 00:00:37,680
hopefully

18
00:00:37,680 --> 00:00:40,960
this goes off without a hitch

19
00:00:41,280 --> 00:00:45,520
all right um so

20
00:00:45,520 --> 00:00:47,200
this title of my talk is kind of

21
00:00:47,200 --> 00:00:48,559
tongue-in-cheek i know

22
00:00:48,559 --> 00:00:51,120
patrick asked me if i'd be interested in

23
00:00:51,120 --> 00:00:52,800
speaking and it looked like he was

24
00:00:52,800 --> 00:00:54,079
putting together

25
00:00:54,079 --> 00:00:56,000
uh a conference that was a little more

26
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:57,760
down to earth and

27
00:00:57,760 --> 00:00:59,760
so something that will grab some

28
00:00:59,760 --> 00:01:01,120
people's attention hopefully

29
00:01:01,120 --> 00:01:02,719
ruffle a few feathers and get some good

30
00:01:02,719 --> 00:01:04,239
q a going uh

31
00:01:04,239 --> 00:01:07,920
was was the goal and

32
00:01:07,920 --> 00:01:10,560
really for me value stream mapping has

33
00:01:10,560 --> 00:01:11,119
been

34
00:01:11,119 --> 00:01:14,880
a blessing and a curse it's

35
00:01:14,880 --> 00:01:16,720
it's something that's been tried and

36
00:01:16,720 --> 00:01:19,280
tested for many many decades now but i

37
00:01:19,280 --> 00:01:20,080
think

38
00:01:20,080 --> 00:01:22,400
the way that we've known it in the past

39
00:01:22,400 --> 00:01:24,400
is not really serving us

40
00:01:24,400 --> 00:01:27,040
in the future so going to walk through

41
00:01:27,040 --> 00:01:28,400
that with you

42
00:01:28,400 --> 00:01:31,520
and uh and hopefully share some some

43
00:01:31,520 --> 00:01:32,560
information

44
00:01:32,560 --> 00:01:34,720
that that you find valuable and and

45
00:01:34,720 --> 00:01:36,159
taking the 20

46
00:01:36,159 --> 00:01:38,159
of values through mapping that i find

47
00:01:38,159 --> 00:01:39,200
really important

48
00:01:39,200 --> 00:01:42,479
that gives you 80 of the value

49
00:01:42,479 --> 00:01:45,600
so to uh to start this off

50
00:01:45,600 --> 00:01:49,600
let me find my window again

51
00:01:49,600 --> 00:01:54,880
oh man moment moment

52
00:01:54,880 --> 00:01:56,799
i had all my monitors all set up and

53
00:01:56,799 --> 00:01:58,880
then it fell

54
00:01:58,880 --> 00:02:02,079
right through okay so

55
00:02:02,079 --> 00:02:05,759
um really to kick this off

56
00:02:06,479 --> 00:02:08,399
by now we've heard a lot of really great

57
00:02:08,399 --> 00:02:10,000
transformation stories

58
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:12,400
and i think one that that kind of nails

59
00:02:12,400 --> 00:02:13,200
it for me is

60
00:02:13,200 --> 00:02:17,040
is uh in the fall of 2019 i was at

61
00:02:17,040 --> 00:02:19,280
devops enterprise summit and uh

62
00:02:19,280 --> 00:02:22,000
nationwide was sharing a story about

63
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:24,400
their transformation and it was

64
00:02:24,400 --> 00:02:26,879
quite shocking i think these are stats

65
00:02:26,879 --> 00:02:28,480
that

66
00:02:28,480 --> 00:02:30,879
we would actually find in many many

67
00:02:30,879 --> 00:02:32,400
organizations but it took a lot of

68
00:02:32,400 --> 00:02:33,360
courage for

69
00:02:33,360 --> 00:02:36,000
nationwide to really dig in and look at

70
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:36,720
them

71
00:02:36,720 --> 00:02:38,879
and then confront them in order to

72
00:02:38,879 --> 00:02:40,879
improve and this 2.5 percent

73
00:02:40,879 --> 00:02:43,040
actually comes from the percentage of

74
00:02:43,040 --> 00:02:44,959
time that the average nationwide

75
00:02:44,959 --> 00:02:46,080
developer was

76
00:02:46,080 --> 00:02:49,519
spending on developing code

77
00:02:49,519 --> 00:02:51,840
uh you know that's the primary job

78
00:02:51,840 --> 00:02:53,120
function and yet

79
00:02:53,120 --> 00:02:55,760
having such a small portion of your time

80
00:02:55,760 --> 00:02:58,640
being focused on that activity

81
00:02:58,640 --> 00:03:00,879
really alludes to the level of waste and

82
00:03:00,879 --> 00:03:02,159
the level of frustration

83
00:03:02,159 --> 00:03:05,440
and the level of uh let's say

84
00:03:05,440 --> 00:03:09,920
um just just a problematic use of time

85
00:03:09,920 --> 00:03:10,720
in a

86
00:03:10,720 --> 00:03:12,319
giant organization and i think we see

87
00:03:12,319 --> 00:03:14,239
this in a lot of enterprises

88
00:03:14,239 --> 00:03:16,480
and uh and to tackle this you know

89
00:03:16,480 --> 00:03:17,680
they've been through

90
00:03:17,680 --> 00:03:19,280
a long transformation effort they tried

91
00:03:19,280 --> 00:03:20,800
a lot of things you know they're big

92
00:03:20,800 --> 00:03:22,319
fans of devops but

93
00:03:22,319 --> 00:03:24,959
what really uh caused them to turn a

94
00:03:24,959 --> 00:03:26,159
corner was

95
00:03:26,159 --> 00:03:29,120
adopting value stream mapping and um

96
00:03:29,120 --> 00:03:29,519
late

97
00:03:29,519 --> 00:03:32,239
in 2018 they started looking at value

98
00:03:32,239 --> 00:03:33,360
stream mapping as

99
00:03:33,360 --> 00:03:36,080
as a way of tackling this visibility

100
00:03:36,080 --> 00:03:36,640
problem

101
00:03:36,640 --> 00:03:39,599
this waste problem and uh and they

102
00:03:39,599 --> 00:03:41,280
brought their release cycle

103
00:03:41,280 --> 00:03:42,720
from three years down to three months

104
00:03:42,720 --> 00:03:44,640
and that that really hammered at home to

105
00:03:44,640 --> 00:03:45,280
me that this

106
00:03:45,280 --> 00:03:47,680
is kind of a practice that's ready for

107
00:03:47,680 --> 00:03:48,959
the enterprise that's ready for

108
00:03:48,959 --> 00:03:50,400
everybody

109
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:52,560
it really validated a lot of assumptions

110
00:03:52,560 --> 00:03:53,519
and and

111
00:03:53,519 --> 00:03:55,360
beliefs that i had about around the

112
00:03:55,360 --> 00:03:58,000
value stream

113
00:03:58,080 --> 00:04:01,439
so myself

114
00:04:01,439 --> 00:04:03,360
um what i'm going to do with this

115
00:04:03,360 --> 00:04:05,680
presentation is take us through

116
00:04:05,680 --> 00:04:09,120
some history some context compare value

117
00:04:09,120 --> 00:04:10,560
streams to pipelines i think a lot of

118
00:04:10,560 --> 00:04:13,280
people are focused on pipelines when

119
00:04:13,280 --> 00:04:15,680
the value stream is is a context that's

120
00:04:15,680 --> 00:04:17,279
extremely valuable

121
00:04:17,279 --> 00:04:20,560
and how we can look at value stream maps

122
00:04:20,560 --> 00:04:20,798
in

123
00:04:20,798 --> 00:04:23,759
in really lean terms and not the

124
00:04:23,759 --> 00:04:26,000
traditional models that we've seen

125
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:28,320
for a long time and then take you

126
00:04:28,320 --> 00:04:29,919
through an example of mapping a real

127
00:04:29,919 --> 00:04:30,720
value stream

128
00:04:30,720 --> 00:04:32,800
and uh and then adding some complexity

129
00:04:32,800 --> 00:04:34,920
where where it can be valuable

130
00:04:34,920 --> 00:04:36,800
[Music]

131
00:04:36,800 --> 00:04:39,840
so a quick intro about myself i've been

132
00:04:39,840 --> 00:04:41,600
in tech for about 20 years

133
00:04:41,600 --> 00:04:43,680
i've been through startup gigs

134
00:04:43,680 --> 00:04:45,759
enterprise gigs

135
00:04:45,759 --> 00:04:48,960
my previous job was cto of a fast

136
00:04:48,960 --> 00:04:50,320
growing startup

137
00:04:50,320 --> 00:04:53,759
and i've always been fascinated by

138
00:04:53,759 --> 00:04:54,960
automation

139
00:04:54,960 --> 00:04:58,080
process engineering flow

140
00:04:58,080 --> 00:05:00,320
when devops came around i was a big big

141
00:05:00,320 --> 00:05:01,440
fan of that

142
00:05:01,440 --> 00:05:04,560
i run the the toronto community here and

143
00:05:04,560 --> 00:05:05,039
i have

144
00:05:05,039 --> 00:05:08,800
since uh i think 2011.

145
00:05:08,800 --> 00:05:11,919
and devops days toronto of course um but

146
00:05:11,919 --> 00:05:13,759
uh

147
00:05:13,759 --> 00:05:17,120
really uh i've encountered uh value

148
00:05:17,120 --> 00:05:18,080
stream maps

149
00:05:18,080 --> 00:05:21,120
a long time ago um i went to uh

150
00:05:21,120 --> 00:05:23,600
business school for a bit uh before i

151
00:05:23,600 --> 00:05:24,560
got tired of it

152
00:05:24,560 --> 00:05:27,360
and part of that program was looking at

153
00:05:27,360 --> 00:05:28,240
traditional

154
00:05:28,240 --> 00:05:31,919
manufacturing traditional ways of

155
00:05:31,919 --> 00:05:35,360
lean enterprise activity optimizing

156
00:05:35,360 --> 00:05:37,600
businesses and workflows and

157
00:05:37,600 --> 00:05:40,160
and supply chains and so this idea of

158
00:05:40,160 --> 00:05:41,440
value stream mapping came up but i

159
00:05:41,440 --> 00:05:42,560
didn't pay too much

160
00:05:42,560 --> 00:05:45,759
attention to it at the time because uh

161
00:05:45,759 --> 00:05:48,240
look at it you know if you look at uh

162
00:05:48,240 --> 00:05:49,840
the definition of value stream mapping

163
00:05:49,840 --> 00:05:50,479
on

164
00:05:50,479 --> 00:05:52,240
wikipedia this is the image that comes

165
00:05:52,240 --> 00:05:54,160
up and it's not exactly

166
00:05:54,160 --> 00:05:56,479
readable right it's not exactly easily

167
00:05:56,479 --> 00:05:58,160
understood

168
00:05:58,160 --> 00:06:00,960
and so i mostly ignored it at the time

169
00:06:00,960 --> 00:06:01,600
even though

170
00:06:01,600 --> 00:06:04,880
it kind of echoed to me a few patterns

171
00:06:04,880 --> 00:06:06,720
that i'd seen in my past

172
00:06:06,720 --> 00:06:08,400
i'd always looked at processes i'd

173
00:06:08,400 --> 00:06:10,080
always been obsessed with kind of

174
00:06:10,080 --> 00:06:11,440
efficiency and

175
00:06:11,440 --> 00:06:14,800
trying to find the highest impact

176
00:06:14,800 --> 00:06:17,680
activities with the lowest effort right

177
00:06:17,680 --> 00:06:20,639
and targeting waste and optimizing

178
00:06:20,639 --> 00:06:22,240
but these kind of examples are all over

179
00:06:22,240 --> 00:06:24,000
value stream mapping you know

180
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:26,720
this is uh for instance a basic value

181
00:06:26,720 --> 00:06:27,520
stream app

182
00:06:27,520 --> 00:06:30,639
you know still unreadable right i mean

183
00:06:30,639 --> 00:06:32,080
you need to go to business school you

184
00:06:32,080 --> 00:06:33,759
need to have a six sigma

185
00:06:33,759 --> 00:06:35,440
certification to read a lot of this

186
00:06:35,440 --> 00:06:36,960
stuff

187
00:06:36,960 --> 00:06:38,639
and this is typically as simple as it

188
00:06:38,639 --> 00:06:41,600
gets but

189
00:06:41,680 --> 00:06:44,800
we have illustrations of lean value

190
00:06:44,800 --> 00:06:46,160
stream maps that are

191
00:06:46,160 --> 00:06:48,479
anything but you know in this case we're

192
00:06:48,479 --> 00:06:50,400
getting some highlights of

193
00:06:50,400 --> 00:06:52,400
you know let's let's look at the two

194
00:06:52,400 --> 00:06:54,000
days but then we have these floating

195
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:54,720
glasses

196
00:06:54,720 --> 00:06:57,840
which need a glossary to figure out and

197
00:06:57,840 --> 00:06:59,759
i think a lot of this is overly complex

198
00:06:59,759 --> 00:07:02,639
and it's not very valuable right

199
00:07:02,639 --> 00:07:06,080
this is the the glossary of uh

200
00:07:06,080 --> 00:07:09,039
icons that you have to memorize to to

201
00:07:09,039 --> 00:07:10,560
make sense of any of this stuff and i

202
00:07:10,560 --> 00:07:12,639
just find that

203
00:07:12,639 --> 00:07:14,720
in order for a value stream app to

204
00:07:14,720 --> 00:07:16,720
really be valuable

205
00:07:16,720 --> 00:07:18,800
and useful it has to resonate with

206
00:07:18,800 --> 00:07:21,199
people it has to be easily understood

207
00:07:21,199 --> 00:07:24,240
so i think all this gets in the way and

208
00:07:24,240 --> 00:07:27,280
it's largely unnecessary you know this

209
00:07:27,280 --> 00:07:28,080
comes from

210
00:07:28,080 --> 00:07:30,000
car manufacturing comes from traditional

211
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:31,599
manufacturing

212
00:07:31,599 --> 00:07:34,080
where we're dealing with a high level of

213
00:07:34,080 --> 00:07:36,240
automation a high level of precision

214
00:07:36,240 --> 00:07:38,880
a high level of iteration and repetition

215
00:07:38,880 --> 00:07:40,560
and so

216
00:07:40,560 --> 00:07:42,720
in some cases seconds matter minutes

217
00:07:42,720 --> 00:07:43,680
matter

218
00:07:43,680 --> 00:07:45,840
in software you know we're we're

219
00:07:45,840 --> 00:07:48,319
tackling new problems all the time

220
00:07:48,319 --> 00:07:50,560
things vary we don't have to have the

221
00:07:50,560 --> 00:07:51,919
level of detail that we have in

222
00:07:51,919 --> 00:07:53,520
traditional manufacturing and we don't

223
00:07:53,520 --> 00:07:53,919
need

224
00:07:53,919 --> 00:07:56,720
this level of detail because it actually

225
00:07:56,720 --> 00:07:58,319
gets in the way of understanding what's

226
00:07:58,319 --> 00:07:59,039
really

227
00:07:59,039 --> 00:08:02,560
going on so

228
00:08:02,560 --> 00:08:05,599
uh i kind of take this and come back to

229
00:08:05,599 --> 00:08:07,680
the idea of like where is the value that

230
00:08:07,680 --> 00:08:09,039
we're trying to get out of this

231
00:08:09,039 --> 00:08:11,759
right we we do an activity like value

232
00:08:11,759 --> 00:08:13,280
stream mapping to find waste

233
00:08:13,280 --> 00:08:14,639
and to find opportunities for

234
00:08:14,639 --> 00:08:16,879
improvement so

235
00:08:16,879 --> 00:08:19,360
where is where can we get that value

236
00:08:19,360 --> 00:08:21,360
where can we get that in

237
00:08:21,360 --> 00:08:24,080
a value stream app if we can't read it

238
00:08:24,080 --> 00:08:24,720
right

239
00:08:24,720 --> 00:08:26,479
and who's the audience for this like who

240
00:08:26,479 --> 00:08:28,080
are we going to be sharing this with

241
00:08:28,080 --> 00:08:29,759
because if they can't understand it

242
00:08:29,759 --> 00:08:32,719
then it's not valuable and that's kind

243
00:08:32,719 --> 00:08:34,479
of brought me to my approach

244
00:08:34,479 --> 00:08:36,559
to all this which is drastically

245
00:08:36,559 --> 00:08:37,599
simplified

246
00:08:37,599 --> 00:08:39,599
and i think very easy for people to take

247
00:08:39,599 --> 00:08:41,039
away from this presentation and do

248
00:08:41,039 --> 00:08:41,530
themselves

249
00:08:41,530 --> 00:08:43,360
[Music]

250
00:08:43,360 --> 00:08:47,200
so i mentioned

251
00:08:47,200 --> 00:08:49,920
the origins in business school but

252
00:08:49,920 --> 00:08:50,399
really

253
00:08:50,399 --> 00:08:52,839
it came to a head in my my previous

254
00:08:52,839 --> 00:08:54,640
position

255
00:08:54,640 --> 00:08:57,920
as cto and i look at our key

256
00:08:57,920 --> 00:09:00,240
processes like onboarding new customers

257
00:09:00,240 --> 00:09:01,600
or

258
00:09:01,600 --> 00:09:03,920
scaling up infrastructure bringing up

259
00:09:03,920 --> 00:09:05,360
test environments

260
00:09:05,360 --> 00:09:07,360
there was a lot of value streams a lot

261
00:09:07,360 --> 00:09:09,279
of processes where

262
00:09:09,279 --> 00:09:11,440
we didn't really have a great idea of

263
00:09:11,440 --> 00:09:13,040
what was going on

264
00:09:13,040 --> 00:09:15,200
some some cases there's a lot of

265
00:09:15,200 --> 00:09:16,320
handoffs

266
00:09:16,320 --> 00:09:17,600
there would be people in different

267
00:09:17,600 --> 00:09:20,160
continents working on things

268
00:09:20,160 --> 00:09:23,440
there would be um a lot of steps

269
00:09:23,440 --> 00:09:24,640
involved because

270
00:09:24,640 --> 00:09:27,040
these things just organically grow right

271
00:09:27,040 --> 00:09:28,080
when you're in a startup

272
00:09:28,080 --> 00:09:29,839
you just figure it out and then you

273
00:09:29,839 --> 00:09:31,600
clean it up later

274
00:09:31,600 --> 00:09:36,160
and so i kind of approach this by

275
00:09:36,160 --> 00:09:38,800
uh taking a step back and and saying to

276
00:09:38,800 --> 00:09:40,240
my team like let's

277
00:09:40,240 --> 00:09:42,320
figure out what the whole thing looks

278
00:09:42,320 --> 00:09:44,640
like and then dig into the details and

279
00:09:44,640 --> 00:09:46,560
and try and measure this

280
00:09:46,560 --> 00:09:48,080
and i didn't call it value stream

281
00:09:48,080 --> 00:09:50,160
mapping at the time

282
00:09:50,160 --> 00:09:51,920
it was just trying to look at the

283
00:09:51,920 --> 00:09:53,839
processes and we did it in

284
00:09:53,839 --> 00:09:57,040
google sheets we really just had a set

285
00:09:57,040 --> 00:09:58,800
of columns where we laid out every

286
00:09:58,800 --> 00:10:00,000
single step

287
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:01,600
and the measurement the timing for each

288
00:10:01,600 --> 00:10:03,040
step and then we would

289
00:10:03,040 --> 00:10:05,279
do multiple passes so every time we

290
00:10:05,279 --> 00:10:07,360
onboard a customer let's record

291
00:10:07,360 --> 00:10:09,440
and let's see where all the time is used

292
00:10:09,440 --> 00:10:11,120
and then we dug into it and

293
00:10:11,120 --> 00:10:12,640
since then i've kind of refined the

294
00:10:12,640 --> 00:10:14,480
technique

295
00:10:14,480 --> 00:10:18,160
um and i'm going to skip over

296
00:10:18,160 --> 00:10:21,839
a piece but um leaving

297
00:10:21,839 --> 00:10:24,800
that position and thinking of what am i

298
00:10:24,800 --> 00:10:27,440
gonna focus all my time on

299
00:10:27,440 --> 00:10:29,680
people started thinking more about value

300
00:10:29,680 --> 00:10:31,440
streams there was a lot of activity

301
00:10:31,440 --> 00:10:33,360
around this this idea that

302
00:10:33,360 --> 00:10:34,959
we really have to be maturing these

303
00:10:34,959 --> 00:10:37,279
processes we're not reinventing the

304
00:10:37,279 --> 00:10:38,800
wheel all the time

305
00:10:38,800 --> 00:10:40,880
and so it makes sense for us to kind of

306
00:10:40,880 --> 00:10:44,240
double down on improving and optimizing

307
00:10:44,240 --> 00:10:46,320
and that brought me to start this

308
00:10:46,320 --> 00:10:48,320
consulting company called visible

309
00:10:48,320 --> 00:10:50,959
focused on value streams because this is

310
00:10:50,959 --> 00:10:52,399
really something that i'm passionate

311
00:10:52,399 --> 00:10:53,440
about and i think

312
00:10:53,440 --> 00:10:55,120
everybody really needs to start doing

313
00:10:55,120 --> 00:10:56,800
this some more often

314
00:10:56,800 --> 00:10:58,640
and i kind of want to dedicate my time

315
00:10:58,640 --> 00:11:00,399
to making this easy and

316
00:11:00,399 --> 00:11:03,440
accessible to people

317
00:11:03,519 --> 00:11:05,279
so to give you a little bit more context

318
00:11:05,279 --> 00:11:06,640
of

319
00:11:06,640 --> 00:11:09,600
stepping back to what is the value from

320
00:11:09,600 --> 00:11:11,200
value stream mapping

321
00:11:11,200 --> 00:11:13,120
what are we really looking to get out of

322
00:11:13,120 --> 00:11:15,040
it right why are we doing the activity

323
00:11:15,040 --> 00:11:15,440
why

324
00:11:15,440 --> 00:11:18,720
even have a value stream map and it's

325
00:11:18,720 --> 00:11:22,640
comes down to trying to get

326
00:11:22,640 --> 00:11:24,480
really valuable information about our

327
00:11:24,480 --> 00:11:25,760
current ceramics

328
00:11:25,760 --> 00:11:27,360
so what are we dealing with what are we

329
00:11:27,360 --> 00:11:28,800
trying to do

330
00:11:28,800 --> 00:11:30,160
what's our current state so that would

331
00:11:30,160 --> 00:11:32,800
be our current state value stream map

332
00:11:32,800 --> 00:11:35,519
where should we go from here is really a

333
00:11:35,519 --> 00:11:37,440
question of what's holding us back

334
00:11:37,440 --> 00:11:39,600
what's in our way what's our current

335
00:11:39,600 --> 00:11:40,640
bottleneck

336
00:11:40,640 --> 00:11:42,240
that's where the measurement comes in

337
00:11:42,240 --> 00:11:44,000
super handy

338
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:47,040
and then how should we get there

339
00:11:47,040 --> 00:11:48,480
that's where the future state value

340
00:11:48,480 --> 00:11:50,320
stream out becomes really valuable

341
00:11:50,320 --> 00:11:53,600
when you can define how you want to

342
00:11:53,600 --> 00:11:54,320
operate

343
00:11:54,320 --> 00:11:55,839
and what you can do given your

344
00:11:55,839 --> 00:11:58,000
capabilities

345
00:11:58,000 --> 00:11:59,440
where should we spend our time where

346
00:11:59,440 --> 00:12:01,519
should we spend our money and a lot of

347
00:12:01,519 --> 00:12:02,079
teams

348
00:12:02,079 --> 00:12:03,839
will operate under the assumption that

349
00:12:03,839 --> 00:12:05,760
they need to invest in a specific area

350
00:12:05,760 --> 00:12:06,800
based on

351
00:12:06,800 --> 00:12:09,920
industry best practices or what other

352
00:12:09,920 --> 00:12:12,399
companies are doing

353
00:12:12,399 --> 00:12:15,920
benchmarks maturity models but really

354
00:12:15,920 --> 00:12:17,839
what's valuable to you and your

355
00:12:17,839 --> 00:12:19,200
organization

356
00:12:19,200 --> 00:12:22,079
is very unique and it changes over time

357
00:12:22,079 --> 00:12:24,000
and it's really about finding what is

358
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:25,360
your biggest bottleneck and you should

359
00:12:25,360 --> 00:12:26,480
focus there

360
00:12:26,480 --> 00:12:29,279
and then move on

361
00:12:29,680 --> 00:12:33,279
so i like to think of combining

362
00:12:33,279 --> 00:12:35,680
compasses and maps and and i see value

363
00:12:35,680 --> 00:12:37,440
stream mapping as one of the maps

364
00:12:37,440 --> 00:12:41,120
that's really critical and i find that

365
00:12:41,120 --> 00:12:43,600
the industry and a lot of people focus a

366
00:12:43,600 --> 00:12:44,560
lot

367
00:12:44,560 --> 00:12:48,480
on compasses things like north stars

368
00:12:48,480 --> 00:12:50,839
you know dora metrics which are

369
00:12:50,839 --> 00:12:52,160
fantastic

370
00:12:52,160 --> 00:12:54,880
using checklists using maturity models

371
00:12:54,880 --> 00:12:56,720
that's kind of analogous to me of like

372
00:12:56,720 --> 00:12:58,079
heading in a direction

373
00:12:58,079 --> 00:13:01,200
right if we're following uber's example

374
00:13:01,200 --> 00:13:02,720
we're just sort of heading towards some

375
00:13:02,720 --> 00:13:04,480
arbitrary criteria

376
00:13:04,480 --> 00:13:07,360
and it's not necessarily based on where

377
00:13:07,360 --> 00:13:08,160
we are

378
00:13:08,160 --> 00:13:11,279
right it's based on where they are and

379
00:13:11,279 --> 00:13:14,959
where we perceive ourselves to be

380
00:13:16,800 --> 00:13:19,599
when we think of

381
00:13:19,839 --> 00:13:22,079
where we get value from compasses is in

382
00:13:22,079 --> 00:13:23,680
combining them with a map so we

383
00:13:23,680 --> 00:13:24,720
understand

384
00:13:24,720 --> 00:13:26,720
not only where we're going but we we see

385
00:13:26,720 --> 00:13:28,160
what's between us and

386
00:13:28,160 --> 00:13:30,800
and where we're going and so things like

387
00:13:30,800 --> 00:13:33,519
value stream mapping

388
00:13:33,519 --> 00:13:35,839
value stream apps are super super

389
00:13:35,839 --> 00:13:37,440
valuable for that

390
00:13:37,440 --> 00:13:39,920
capability mapping to see what are we

391
00:13:39,920 --> 00:13:40,880
what are the core

392
00:13:40,880 --> 00:13:43,120
competencies that we need and that we

393
00:13:43,120 --> 00:13:43,920
have

394
00:13:43,920 --> 00:13:45,519
and how do we leverage our strengths and

395
00:13:45,519 --> 00:13:47,600
how do we fill the gaps that we have

396
00:13:47,600 --> 00:13:49,600
and when we combine them together we get

397
00:13:49,600 --> 00:13:52,000
something that's incredibly powerful

398
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:53,920
because if i'm taking a value stream map

399
00:13:53,920 --> 00:13:55,199
and i'm going to show an example

400
00:13:55,199 --> 00:13:57,360
of how you can combine something like a

401
00:13:57,360 --> 00:13:58,800
value stream app with

402
00:13:58,800 --> 00:14:01,839
dora metrics to really get a fantastic

403
00:14:01,839 --> 00:14:04,240
idea of not only where you are

404
00:14:04,240 --> 00:14:07,040
and where you want to go but how to get

405
00:14:07,040 --> 00:14:09,100
there and what's really in your way

406
00:14:09,100 --> 00:14:10,560
[Music]

407
00:14:10,560 --> 00:14:13,760
so in a lot of organizations this might

408
00:14:13,760 --> 00:14:16,160
look like a familiar picture

409
00:14:16,160 --> 00:14:19,519
i find that it's very common to have

410
00:14:19,519 --> 00:14:22,800
all kinds of activities

411
00:14:22,800 --> 00:14:26,399
and waste and bottlenecks

412
00:14:26,399 --> 00:14:29,519
that are beyond our ci cd pipelines

413
00:14:29,519 --> 00:14:31,440
outside of the automation that we have

414
00:14:31,440 --> 00:14:33,680
outside of our processes outside of

415
00:14:33,680 --> 00:14:35,600
anything that we're really keeping track

416
00:14:35,600 --> 00:14:37,360
of or paying attention to

417
00:14:37,360 --> 00:14:40,000
and it might show up in jira it might

418
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:40,880
not

419
00:14:40,880 --> 00:14:43,120
it probably doesn't right so when we

420
00:14:43,120 --> 00:14:44,000
look at the real

421
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:46,240
measurement of what's going on it

422
00:14:46,240 --> 00:14:48,000
captures a lot more of this

423
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:51,279
the things that are really painful and

424
00:14:51,279 --> 00:14:54,160
uh and that allows us to really tackle

425
00:14:54,160 --> 00:14:56,560
what's holding us back

426
00:14:56,560 --> 00:14:57,839
and i think it's really important you

427
00:14:57,839 --> 00:15:00,000
know it can be painful to acknowledge

428
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:02,399
you know this is what's really going on

429
00:15:02,399 --> 00:15:03,120
but i think

430
00:15:03,120 --> 00:15:05,360
in we see so much value from

431
00:15:05,360 --> 00:15:06,639
transparency we see

432
00:15:06,639 --> 00:15:09,680
so much value from acknowledging the

433
00:15:09,680 --> 00:15:11,519
real scenario that we're dealing with

434
00:15:11,519 --> 00:15:13,680
that it gives us an incredible starting

435
00:15:13,680 --> 00:15:15,760
point it puts us

436
00:15:15,760 --> 00:15:18,079
on the same page with our teams and it

437
00:15:18,079 --> 00:15:18,800
can be

438
00:15:18,800 --> 00:15:21,199
a really cathartic activity to look at

439
00:15:21,199 --> 00:15:22,639
what's actually happening

440
00:15:22,639 --> 00:15:24,240
because instead of throwing your time

441
00:15:24,240 --> 00:15:25,680
and money at something that you think is

442
00:15:25,680 --> 00:15:27,120
going to change

443
00:15:27,120 --> 00:15:29,519
and improve things you can actually

444
00:15:29,519 --> 00:15:31,279
tackle things that are really

445
00:15:31,279 --> 00:15:34,720
affecting you so

446
00:15:34,720 --> 00:15:37,040
a lot of teams spend a lot of time

447
00:15:37,040 --> 00:15:38,399
looking at pipelines

448
00:15:38,399 --> 00:15:40,959
and we as an industry are kind of

449
00:15:40,959 --> 00:15:41,759
obsessed

450
00:15:41,759 --> 00:15:45,279
with cice and automation

451
00:15:45,279 --> 00:15:46,880
and it's because we have a lot of

452
00:15:46,880 --> 00:15:49,040
vendors who are providing a lot of

453
00:15:49,040 --> 00:15:50,000
fantastic pro

454
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:52,560
products they're fun to play with uh

455
00:15:52,560 --> 00:15:54,000
automation is always

456
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:56,720
it always seems like a good idea and we

457
00:15:56,720 --> 00:15:59,199
have a lot of people talking still today

458
00:15:59,199 --> 00:16:01,120
i think i've read probably three times

459
00:16:01,120 --> 00:16:02,800
today scrolling through

460
00:16:02,800 --> 00:16:05,279
my various feeds to automate everything

461
00:16:05,279 --> 00:16:06,800
right people are talking about this all

462
00:16:06,800 --> 00:16:08,959
the time

463
00:16:08,959 --> 00:16:11,920
and it's not it's not true you know you

464
00:16:11,920 --> 00:16:12,639
should be

465
00:16:12,639 --> 00:16:15,360
automating what's really valuable and

466
00:16:15,360 --> 00:16:16,720
what that means is that

467
00:16:16,720 --> 00:16:18,959
we have to look outside of the pipeline

468
00:16:18,959 --> 00:16:20,160
you know the pipeline

469
00:16:20,160 --> 00:16:22,639
is already automated for the most part

470
00:16:22,639 --> 00:16:23,519
right

471
00:16:23,519 --> 00:16:25,600
it's the least of your worries because

472
00:16:25,600 --> 00:16:26,560
what really

473
00:16:26,560 --> 00:16:29,040
is probably holding you back is outside

474
00:16:29,040 --> 00:16:30,480
of your automation

475
00:16:30,480 --> 00:16:32,240
right the things like the approvals to

476
00:16:32,240 --> 00:16:34,160
take forever the meetings

477
00:16:34,160 --> 00:16:36,720
that happen for no reason uh the emails

478
00:16:36,720 --> 00:16:38,720
that sit in somebody's uh

479
00:16:38,720 --> 00:16:40,639
inbox for a week because they're on

480
00:16:40,639 --> 00:16:41,920
vacation

481
00:16:41,920 --> 00:16:43,440
that all makes everything that happens

482
00:16:43,440 --> 00:16:45,360
in the pipeline seem

483
00:16:45,360 --> 00:16:47,440
pretty insignificant right because if if

484
00:16:47,440 --> 00:16:49,759
we're wasting three days a week

485
00:16:49,759 --> 00:16:53,360
on handoffs then what is a four hour

486
00:16:53,360 --> 00:16:54,160
pipeline

487
00:16:54,160 --> 00:16:57,519
uh in comparison so i think it's really

488
00:16:57,519 --> 00:16:58,399
important to

489
00:16:58,399 --> 00:17:00,000
to look at this big picture and step

490
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:02,320
away from the pipeline and look at

491
00:17:02,320 --> 00:17:03,680
where are we starting the value stream

492
00:17:03,680 --> 00:17:04,959
where are we ending the value stream and

493
00:17:04,959 --> 00:17:06,319
what's really

494
00:17:06,319 --> 00:17:09,599
going on so

495
00:17:09,599 --> 00:17:14,160
uh to simplify this and in contrast with

496
00:17:14,160 --> 00:17:15,919
what we saw earlier in the presentation

497
00:17:15,919 --> 00:17:18,079
this example of super complex value

498
00:17:18,079 --> 00:17:19,199
streams

499
00:17:19,199 --> 00:17:20,959
just for anyone who's new or anyone

500
00:17:20,959 --> 00:17:22,240
who's wondering about

501
00:17:22,240 --> 00:17:24,559
the sort of elemental pieces that are

502
00:17:24,559 --> 00:17:26,400
incredibly valuable here

503
00:17:26,400 --> 00:17:28,240
we're talking about steps and we're

504
00:17:28,240 --> 00:17:30,840
talking about timing

505
00:17:30,840 --> 00:17:34,000
and what happens pretty often

506
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:36,720
if we compare this to just looking at a

507
00:17:36,720 --> 00:17:37,520
pipeline

508
00:17:37,520 --> 00:17:40,559
is that this pipeline is one step and

509
00:17:40,559 --> 00:17:41,440
this manual

510
00:17:41,440 --> 00:17:45,679
stuff upstream and the waiting time

511
00:17:45,679 --> 00:17:48,799
is really um oh you guys can see my

512
00:17:48,799 --> 00:17:50,559
cursor that's fantastic even though it's

513
00:17:50,559 --> 00:17:52,320
going to be slow but

514
00:17:52,320 --> 00:17:54,799
if we're looking at manual steps and

515
00:17:54,799 --> 00:17:56,080
we're looking at

516
00:17:56,080 --> 00:17:58,000
waiting time these are incredibly

517
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:00,000
valuable issues to tackle

518
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:02,080
and this automation piece is probably

519
00:18:02,080 --> 00:18:03,679
insignificant in comparison

520
00:18:03,679 --> 00:18:06,720
because we're probably tackling uh maybe

521
00:18:06,720 --> 00:18:08,480
hours maybe minutes

522
00:18:08,480 --> 00:18:10,880
with automation but the opportunity for

523
00:18:10,880 --> 00:18:11,919
improvement

524
00:18:11,919 --> 00:18:16,240
in the manual world is huge right

525
00:18:16,640 --> 00:18:19,440
so if we look at an example a high level

526
00:18:19,440 --> 00:18:22,000
example in abstract again

527
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:26,400
from ticket to enabling a feature

528
00:18:26,640 --> 00:18:29,280
what we have is this idea of measurement

529
00:18:29,280 --> 00:18:31,120
which is incredibly valuable a lot of

530
00:18:31,120 --> 00:18:32,320
teams

531
00:18:32,320 --> 00:18:36,000
build draw flow diagrams and

532
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:37,600
there's no concept of measurement

533
00:18:37,600 --> 00:18:39,840
incorporated in it and and it's

534
00:18:39,840 --> 00:18:42,160
of limited value we really get so much

535
00:18:42,160 --> 00:18:43,360
value by

536
00:18:43,360 --> 00:18:45,120
seeing the measurement involved in any

537
00:18:45,120 --> 00:18:47,120
of this

538
00:18:47,120 --> 00:18:50,400
so the primary measurement

539
00:18:50,400 --> 00:18:52,400
timing which is the step timing how long

540
00:18:52,400 --> 00:18:53,600
does it take us to

541
00:18:53,600 --> 00:18:56,880
create a ticket right the wait time

542
00:18:56,880 --> 00:18:59,280
how long does that ticket sit before

543
00:18:59,280 --> 00:19:01,039
someone actually starts to work on it

544
00:19:01,039 --> 00:19:03,600
for instance

545
00:19:03,600 --> 00:19:05,440
and our cicd pipeline is really

546
00:19:05,440 --> 00:19:07,760
concerned with this piece in the middle

547
00:19:07,760 --> 00:19:10,720
the code to deploy steps right so all

548
00:19:10,720 --> 00:19:12,160
that waiting time upfront all the

549
00:19:12,160 --> 00:19:13,360
frustration

550
00:19:13,360 --> 00:19:16,640
all the handoff all the misunderstanding

551
00:19:16,640 --> 00:19:19,200
that can cause a bunch of rework and a

552
00:19:19,200 --> 00:19:20,880
bunch of wasted effort

553
00:19:20,880 --> 00:19:23,840
is ignored by the cicd pipeline so it

554
00:19:23,840 --> 00:19:25,200
really helps to be

555
00:19:25,200 --> 00:19:26,799
zoomed out and looking at the whole

556
00:19:26,799 --> 00:19:28,559
process

557
00:19:28,559 --> 00:19:31,280
so i'm going to actually layer to put

558
00:19:31,280 --> 00:19:32,799
this more in context

559
00:19:32,799 --> 00:19:35,840
and share with you how we combine sort

560
00:19:35,840 --> 00:19:36,080
of

561
00:19:36,080 --> 00:19:40,799
this map with compass

562
00:19:40,799 --> 00:19:43,440
i'm going to layer on the dora metrics

563
00:19:43,440 --> 00:19:45,440
so that everyone can see like how

564
00:19:45,440 --> 00:19:47,679
you can use something like a value

565
00:19:47,679 --> 00:19:49,600
stream map to start measuring dora

566
00:19:49,600 --> 00:19:50,320
metrics

567
00:19:50,320 --> 00:19:52,000
without instrumenting all your tools

568
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:53,520
without a bunch of automation without

569
00:19:53,520 --> 00:19:54,400
waiting

570
00:19:54,400 --> 00:19:56,240
weeks or months to get those

571
00:19:56,240 --> 00:19:57,520
measurements

572
00:19:57,520 --> 00:19:59,200
you can literally walk through your

573
00:19:59,200 --> 00:20:00,720
process with a stopwatch

574
00:20:00,720 --> 00:20:03,440
or your phone in realistic terms and

575
00:20:03,440 --> 00:20:04,880
measure all of this and start getting

576
00:20:04,880 --> 00:20:05,600
data

577
00:20:05,600 --> 00:20:08,559
right it's really not that challenging

578
00:20:08,559 --> 00:20:10,320
so we'll see lead time

579
00:20:10,320 --> 00:20:12,400
start to finish we see deployment

580
00:20:12,400 --> 00:20:14,720
frequency echoing that

581
00:20:14,720 --> 00:20:18,640
cicd pipeline frame we see mean time to

582
00:20:18,640 --> 00:20:20,320
recover so once we deploy

583
00:20:20,320 --> 00:20:22,799
how long does it take for us to switch

584
00:20:22,799 --> 00:20:24,320
gears and redeploy

585
00:20:24,320 --> 00:20:27,520
and either ideally fail forward and

586
00:20:27,520 --> 00:20:30,400
and fix those issues and then change

587
00:20:30,400 --> 00:20:31,440
failed percentage how

588
00:20:31,440 --> 00:20:33,440
often are we deploying code that fails

589
00:20:33,440 --> 00:20:35,280
how often are we going into

590
00:20:35,280 --> 00:20:38,720
production with with code issues with

591
00:20:38,720 --> 00:20:40,880
with product issues

592
00:20:40,880 --> 00:20:43,440
so it becomes this really valuable

593
00:20:43,440 --> 00:20:45,600
framework that we can layer all kinds of

594
00:20:45,600 --> 00:20:47,120
measurements on top of

595
00:20:47,120 --> 00:20:49,120
and put them in a visual context of the

596
00:20:49,120 --> 00:20:50,720
entire process

597
00:20:50,720 --> 00:20:54,720
and really start to get rapid

598
00:20:54,720 --> 00:20:58,080
valuable measurement and that can

599
00:20:58,080 --> 00:21:00,240
speak to the business that can speak to

600
00:21:00,240 --> 00:21:01,840
the product teams that can speak to

601
00:21:01,840 --> 00:21:03,520
sales success

602
00:21:03,520 --> 00:21:05,600
people can start to see okay when when

603
00:21:05,600 --> 00:21:07,600
you say deployment frequency now

604
00:21:07,600 --> 00:21:09,440
i understand what it means because i can

605
00:21:09,440 --> 00:21:12,080
see the picture

606
00:21:12,960 --> 00:21:15,360
so if we're going to look at a more

607
00:21:15,360 --> 00:21:16,000
specific

608
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:18,960
example often what i'll do with teams is

609
00:21:18,960 --> 00:21:21,280
to start really really high with this

610
00:21:21,280 --> 00:21:23,760
and i think it's really valuable to get

611
00:21:23,760 --> 00:21:24,880
a high level

612
00:21:24,880 --> 00:21:27,760
starting point let me move my cursor out

613
00:21:27,760 --> 00:21:29,120
of the way

614
00:21:29,120 --> 00:21:32,640
because you can always

615
00:21:32,640 --> 00:21:35,280
drill down and decide where you want to

616
00:21:35,280 --> 00:21:36,320
focus your energy

617
00:21:36,320 --> 00:21:39,440
but starting high means that you're

618
00:21:39,440 --> 00:21:40,640
bringing people in

619
00:21:40,640 --> 00:21:42,720
based on a very very general

620
00:21:42,720 --> 00:21:44,320
understanding and then you can zoom in

621
00:21:44,320 --> 00:21:45,760
and zoom in

622
00:21:45,760 --> 00:21:49,120
so this is from a fortune 100 company a

623
00:21:49,120 --> 00:21:49,760
gigantic

624
00:21:49,760 --> 00:21:53,360
organization a very long

625
00:21:53,360 --> 00:21:56,480
release process they're running safe

626
00:21:56,480 --> 00:22:00,320
actually very complex uh physical

627
00:22:00,320 --> 00:22:04,400
and uh digital products combined

628
00:22:04,400 --> 00:22:06,880
and we decided we're going to focus on

629
00:22:06,880 --> 00:22:08,480
product development we're going to focus

630
00:22:08,480 --> 00:22:09,919
on execution we're going to

631
00:22:09,919 --> 00:22:13,919
focus on staging deployment and

632
00:22:13,919 --> 00:22:15,760
these are all sort of hypotheses we

633
00:22:15,760 --> 00:22:17,520
could actually measure these out if we

634
00:22:17,520 --> 00:22:19,360
wanted to but if we have a good idea

635
00:22:19,360 --> 00:22:21,919
we can just go ahead and dive in right

636
00:22:21,919 --> 00:22:22,559
and you can

637
00:22:22,559 --> 00:22:23,919
you can switch gears and look at

638
00:22:23,919 --> 00:22:26,159
different areas however you like

639
00:22:26,159 --> 00:22:29,120
but it can be valuable to kind of lay

640
00:22:29,120 --> 00:22:31,120
these out and then specifically dive in

641
00:22:31,120 --> 00:22:32,960
because anyone following the process if

642
00:22:32,960 --> 00:22:35,039
they weren't part of the exercise

643
00:22:35,039 --> 00:22:36,720
they can easily see okay here's how we

644
00:22:36,720 --> 00:22:39,679
got to where we're going

645
00:22:39,679 --> 00:22:41,440
so if we look at a specific software

646
00:22:41,440 --> 00:22:43,039
delivery value stream inside of

647
00:22:43,039 --> 00:22:46,400
staging deployment because we have a

648
00:22:46,400 --> 00:22:48,640
hypothesis that we can improve

649
00:22:48,640 --> 00:22:51,200
our staging deployment process maybe we

650
00:22:51,200 --> 00:22:51,840
that's

651
00:22:51,840 --> 00:22:53,760
incredibly painful people complain about

652
00:22:53,760 --> 00:22:55,520
it all the time it's failing it takes

653
00:22:55,520 --> 00:22:56,400
forever

654
00:22:56,400 --> 00:23:00,480
to spin up an environment for instance

655
00:23:00,480 --> 00:23:02,400
let's dig into it and look at a value

656
00:23:02,400 --> 00:23:03,600
stream map

657
00:23:03,600 --> 00:23:06,960
to measure exactly what's going on

658
00:23:06,960 --> 00:23:08,960
so if we look at our station deployment

659
00:23:08,960 --> 00:23:11,280
process we start with artifact creation

660
00:23:11,280 --> 00:23:13,200
we end with validation these specific

661
00:23:13,200 --> 00:23:15,280
steps don't really matter but

662
00:23:15,280 --> 00:23:19,440
for illustration purposes um

663
00:23:19,440 --> 00:23:22,000
what we were looking at initially was

664
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:23,919
the leadership on in the organization

665
00:23:23,919 --> 00:23:24,880
that said

666
00:23:24,880 --> 00:23:26,960
we have 20 million dollars we need to

667
00:23:26,960 --> 00:23:30,400
spend on devops initiatives

668
00:23:30,400 --> 00:23:33,440
we want to build automated deployment

669
00:23:33,440 --> 00:23:36,720
and this is based on something right

670
00:23:36,720 --> 00:23:38,640
they read some case study

671
00:23:38,640 --> 00:23:40,960
or they saw a talk or they talked to

672
00:23:40,960 --> 00:23:41,919
somebody

673
00:23:41,919 --> 00:23:44,400
and heard that automated deployment is

674
00:23:44,400 --> 00:23:46,080
the greatest thing in the world

675
00:23:46,080 --> 00:23:48,320
it's pretty great but is it your biggest

676
00:23:48,320 --> 00:23:49,840
bottleneck and that's what we wanted to

677
00:23:49,840 --> 00:23:50,640
figure out

678
00:23:50,640 --> 00:23:53,679
right maybe so maybe not

679
00:23:53,679 --> 00:23:56,320
so you get there by measuring and we

680
00:23:56,320 --> 00:23:57,440
looked at

681
00:23:57,440 --> 00:23:59,279
if we measure every step of the process

682
00:23:59,279 --> 00:24:01,039
we measure the wait time

683
00:24:01,039 --> 00:24:02,880
some interesting patterns start to pop

684
00:24:02,880 --> 00:24:04,880
out and you'll see these highlighted in

685
00:24:04,880 --> 00:24:06,480
red here

686
00:24:06,480 --> 00:24:09,440
so what happens is we get two hotspots

687
00:24:09,440 --> 00:24:10,320
and

688
00:24:10,320 --> 00:24:11,919
this is all the detail that we need to

689
00:24:11,919 --> 00:24:13,679
make a really good

690
00:24:13,679 --> 00:24:16,640
informed decision about where we should

691
00:24:16,640 --> 00:24:17,279
focus

692
00:24:17,279 --> 00:24:21,200
certainly we can decide that focusing on

693
00:24:21,200 --> 00:24:23,520
automated deployment and spending 20

694
00:24:23,520 --> 00:24:25,200
million dollars

695
00:24:25,200 --> 00:24:28,159
might only save us 12 minutes every time

696
00:24:28,159 --> 00:24:29,520
we run this process

697
00:24:29,520 --> 00:24:31,760
right so we've already saved a ton of

698
00:24:31,760 --> 00:24:33,360
time a ton of effort

699
00:24:33,360 --> 00:24:35,039
trying to do something that is not

700
00:24:35,039 --> 00:24:37,200
actually going to move the needle

701
00:24:37,200 --> 00:24:38,559
but if we're looking at environment

702
00:24:38,559 --> 00:24:41,840
creation and acceptance testing

703
00:24:41,840 --> 00:24:44,320
all of a sudden we've got 11 hours 20

704
00:24:44,320 --> 00:24:46,880
hours these are huge chunks

705
00:24:46,880 --> 00:24:49,440
of the value stream especially compared

706
00:24:49,440 --> 00:24:51,520
to everything else that's going on

707
00:24:51,520 --> 00:24:53,279
so something's going on in environment

708
00:24:53,279 --> 00:24:54,559
creation something's going on in

709
00:24:54,559 --> 00:24:55,840
acceptance testing

710
00:24:55,840 --> 00:24:57,360
maybe there's something we can improve

711
00:24:57,360 --> 00:24:58,880
maybe not but

712
00:24:58,880 --> 00:25:01,200
at least we know where to look further

713
00:25:01,200 --> 00:25:02,970
and that's incredibly valuable

714
00:25:02,970 --> 00:25:04,480
[Music]

715
00:25:04,480 --> 00:25:06,240
and by comparison we're looking at

716
00:25:06,240 --> 00:25:07,919
roughly 15 minutes with artifact

717
00:25:07,919 --> 00:25:09,679
deployment so we know

718
00:25:09,679 --> 00:25:11,520
any time we spend there is going to have

719
00:25:11,520 --> 00:25:14,400
a minor minor impact and that's going to

720
00:25:14,400 --> 00:25:16,640
save us a lot of effort frustration

721
00:25:16,640 --> 00:25:18,159
we're going to settle a lot of arguments

722
00:25:18,159 --> 00:25:20,080
with this for people who have different

723
00:25:20,080 --> 00:25:21,679
ideas about where we should spend our

724
00:25:21,679 --> 00:25:22,400
time

725
00:25:22,400 --> 00:25:24,559
and that's super super valuable to get

726
00:25:24,559 --> 00:25:25,919
us moving forward

727
00:25:25,919 --> 00:25:28,159
but we still have this difference in

728
00:25:28,159 --> 00:25:29,520
measurement so where should we be

729
00:25:29,520 --> 00:25:31,200
spending our energy

730
00:25:31,200 --> 00:25:34,159
20 hours is obviously more than 11. but

731
00:25:34,159 --> 00:25:34,720
what if

732
00:25:34,720 --> 00:25:37,840
uh smoke testing feels 60 of the time

733
00:25:37,840 --> 00:25:39,440
then all of a sudden environment

734
00:25:39,440 --> 00:25:41,279
creation bumps up a bit

735
00:25:41,279 --> 00:25:43,200
right it's happening more often because

736
00:25:43,200 --> 00:25:44,559
we're going back

737
00:25:44,559 --> 00:25:46,400
if we're going back from smoke testing

738
00:25:46,400 --> 00:25:48,000
to environment creation then all of a

739
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:49,200
sudden we're

740
00:25:49,200 --> 00:25:50,720
we're incurring these penalties we don't

741
00:25:50,720 --> 00:25:53,039
have this eight-hour wait time

742
00:25:53,039 --> 00:25:55,919
possibly every time but this starts to

743
00:25:55,919 --> 00:25:57,919
creep up towards 20 hours and because

744
00:25:57,919 --> 00:25:59,120
it's upstream

745
00:25:59,120 --> 00:26:01,600
it's a little bit more valuable so you

746
00:26:01,600 --> 00:26:03,279
can make these sort of

747
00:26:03,279 --> 00:26:05,520
decisions based on real data and that's

748
00:26:05,520 --> 00:26:06,680
incredibly powerful

749
00:26:06,680 --> 00:26:08,880
[Music]

750
00:26:08,880 --> 00:26:10,880
so there's a lot more detail that we can

751
00:26:10,880 --> 00:26:12,720
add to this um

752
00:26:12,720 --> 00:26:14,400
if you want you can start highlighting

753
00:26:14,400 --> 00:26:16,960
roles uh so who's actually performing

754
00:26:16,960 --> 00:26:18,400
each step that can be incredibly

755
00:26:18,400 --> 00:26:20,159
valuable because we've got

756
00:26:20,159 --> 00:26:22,000
a different owner in every step that's a

757
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:23,679
lot of handoffs

758
00:26:23,679 --> 00:26:26,799
and if we can streamline that and say

759
00:26:26,799 --> 00:26:29,760
instead of one person able to complete

760
00:26:29,760 --> 00:26:30,720
one task

761
00:26:30,720 --> 00:26:32,799
maybe one person can complete three and

762
00:26:32,799 --> 00:26:34,000
then they're just handing off to

763
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:35,679
themselves they can just

764
00:26:35,679 --> 00:26:38,880
fly through um we can look at the tools

765
00:26:38,880 --> 00:26:40,640
involved because if we have

766
00:26:40,640 --> 00:26:42,240
fragmented tools and they're not

767
00:26:42,240 --> 00:26:44,000
integrated that could be

768
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:46,320
a big cause away time we can look at the

769
00:26:46,320 --> 00:26:48,480
artifacts that are created every step

770
00:26:48,480 --> 00:26:52,000
so what is the uh what are we actually

771
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:54,000
building every single time you know

772
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:55,840
maybe we're just producing an email and

773
00:26:55,840 --> 00:26:57,279
then we can say okay well what's the

774
00:26:57,279 --> 00:26:59,200
value of that email

775
00:26:59,200 --> 00:27:02,400
and inside of the the steps themselves

776
00:27:02,400 --> 00:27:04,240
we can look at how much time is actually

777
00:27:04,240 --> 00:27:06,159
spent on adding value

778
00:27:06,159 --> 00:27:09,600
right out of artifact deploy are we

779
00:27:09,600 --> 00:27:10,559
waiting for

780
00:27:10,559 --> 00:27:12,559
machines to finish things or are they

781
00:27:12,559 --> 00:27:13,840
constantly working at

782
00:27:13,840 --> 00:27:17,360
peak efficiency

783
00:27:17,679 --> 00:27:19,360
percent complete and accurate is the

784
00:27:19,360 --> 00:27:21,279
last one that's kind of a measurement of

785
00:27:21,279 --> 00:27:22,399
quality but

786
00:27:22,399 --> 00:27:25,520
at each step what is the percentage of

787
00:27:25,520 --> 00:27:27,440
what we're producing that is complete

788
00:27:27,440 --> 00:27:28,480
and accurate

789
00:27:28,480 --> 00:27:31,679
which is how how much are we

790
00:27:31,679 --> 00:27:33,600
creating that's going to get thrown back

791
00:27:33,600 --> 00:27:35,360
because it's a poor quality or it's not

792
00:27:35,360 --> 00:27:37,039
up to spec or we're unclear on the

793
00:27:37,039 --> 00:27:38,320
requirements

794
00:27:38,320 --> 00:27:39,760
we can start to measure all kinds of

795
00:27:39,760 --> 00:27:41,919
things layered on top but this is

796
00:27:41,919 --> 00:27:44,240
graduated complexity right we're not

797
00:27:44,240 --> 00:27:46,880
demanding all this detail up front

798
00:27:46,880 --> 00:27:49,679
we're starting from a very clear picture

799
00:27:49,679 --> 00:27:51,840
and it's very easy to understand whether

800
00:27:51,840 --> 00:27:53,360
you're in sales whether you are in

801
00:27:53,360 --> 00:27:55,279
marketing whether you're in success

802
00:27:55,279 --> 00:27:56,960
whether you're in development

803
00:27:56,960 --> 00:27:58,399
whether you're in leadership at any

804
00:27:58,399 --> 00:28:00,559
level everybody can look at something

805
00:28:00,559 --> 00:28:01,360
like this

806
00:28:01,360 --> 00:28:05,200
and people don't have arguments over

807
00:28:05,200 --> 00:28:08,320
how to interpret 12 hours you know

808
00:28:08,320 --> 00:28:10,559
it doesn't have to be precise but when

809
00:28:10,559 --> 00:28:13,039
you have 12 hours versus 2 minutes

810
00:28:13,039 --> 00:28:17,120
it's hard to argue about those details

811
00:28:17,120 --> 00:28:19,840
so to kind of wrap up here um i know

812
00:28:19,840 --> 00:28:21,760
where we're getting to time

813
00:28:21,760 --> 00:28:25,360
where i see a lot of this value

814
00:28:25,360 --> 00:28:26,960
inside of value stream mapping is the

815
00:28:26,960 --> 00:28:30,080
idea of we're bringing visibility

816
00:28:30,080 --> 00:28:32,480
to people we're bringing measurements to

817
00:28:32,480 --> 00:28:33,600
settle arguments

818
00:28:33,600 --> 00:28:36,559
to prevent arguments to prevent opinion

819
00:28:36,559 --> 00:28:36,960
in

820
00:28:36,960 --> 00:28:39,279
in decisions to make very high quality

821
00:28:39,279 --> 00:28:40,240
decisions

822
00:28:40,240 --> 00:28:41,520
and it's all in the service of

823
00:28:41,520 --> 00:28:43,039
improvement you know we're going to

824
00:28:43,039 --> 00:28:43,520
drive

825
00:28:43,520 --> 00:28:45,360
real improvement by focusing on what's

826
00:28:45,360 --> 00:28:46,640
really holding us back

827
00:28:46,640 --> 00:28:48,500
and what's really impacting us

828
00:28:48,500 --> 00:28:49,840
[Music]

829
00:28:49,840 --> 00:28:53,120
and the other great news is that this

830
00:28:53,120 --> 00:28:54,799
is everywhere you know you can use the

831
00:28:54,799 --> 00:28:57,120
exact same practices to tackle your

832
00:28:57,120 --> 00:28:59,440
triage your incident response

833
00:28:59,440 --> 00:29:01,840
your data life cycle make your meetings

834
00:29:01,840 --> 00:29:02,799
more efficient

835
00:29:02,799 --> 00:29:05,440
you can improve your hiring process

836
00:29:05,440 --> 00:29:07,360
there's no process that isn't a value

837
00:29:07,360 --> 00:29:08,000
stream

838
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:10,399
and you can use the same practices to

839
00:29:10,399 --> 00:29:13,840
improve all of them

840
00:29:13,840 --> 00:29:16,799
to sum up the benefits that i see uh i

841
00:29:16,799 --> 00:29:17,279
think

842
00:29:17,279 --> 00:29:19,440
the relevance is really important we're

843
00:29:19,440 --> 00:29:21,279
not looking at industry benchmarks we're

844
00:29:21,279 --> 00:29:22,080
not looking at

845
00:29:22,080 --> 00:29:24,640
checklists that or arbitrary maturity

846
00:29:24,640 --> 00:29:26,480
models this is based on

847
00:29:26,480 --> 00:29:29,360
your team your organization right now as

848
00:29:29,360 --> 00:29:30,480
it is

849
00:29:30,480 --> 00:29:32,320
and that's incredibly powerful we're not

850
00:29:32,320 --> 00:29:34,320
talking about measuring against somebody

851
00:29:34,320 --> 00:29:36,799
else you're measuring against yourself

852
00:29:36,799 --> 00:29:39,840
and it's accessible it's easy to read

853
00:29:39,840 --> 00:29:41,600
the whole practice is really bringing

854
00:29:41,600 --> 00:29:43,840
people together whether they're

855
00:29:43,840 --> 00:29:46,000
uh distributed around the world and

856
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:46,960
we're doing this over

857
00:29:46,960 --> 00:29:49,279
zoom in in a digital whiteboard or for

858
00:29:49,279 --> 00:29:50,880
all in the same room

859
00:29:50,880 --> 00:29:53,039
it works the same you know it's it's the

860
00:29:53,039 --> 00:29:54,080
same um

861
00:29:54,080 --> 00:29:57,200
principles and the same value and it's

862
00:29:57,200 --> 00:29:58,399
actionable you know these are

863
00:29:58,399 --> 00:30:00,159
bottlenecks that are affecting you right

864
00:30:00,159 --> 00:30:00,960
now

865
00:30:00,960 --> 00:30:03,039
and the payoff when we're talking about

866
00:30:03,039 --> 00:30:05,440
some process that executes every week

867
00:30:05,440 --> 00:30:07,679
you get that benefit over and over and

868
00:30:07,679 --> 00:30:08,640
over again

869
00:30:08,640 --> 00:30:11,919
so uh you'll hear about

870
00:30:11,919 --> 00:30:15,760
like satya nadella talking about um

871
00:30:15,760 --> 00:30:17,679
he thinks one of the most important

872
00:30:17,679 --> 00:30:19,840
things that a company can work on is how

873
00:30:19,840 --> 00:30:20,720
they work

874
00:30:20,720 --> 00:30:23,840
and i agree and a company like uh

875
00:30:23,840 --> 00:30:27,120
microsoft i think they have 1500 people

876
00:30:27,120 --> 00:30:29,120
focused on just workflow

877
00:30:29,120 --> 00:30:32,720
and optimizing workflow google spends

878
00:30:32,720 --> 00:30:34,880
something like a billion dollars on it

879
00:30:34,880 --> 00:30:36,799
and uh and i think that you know the

880
00:30:36,799 --> 00:30:38,159
proof's in the pudding

881
00:30:38,159 --> 00:30:43,120
they all have excellent reputations for

882
00:30:43,120 --> 00:30:45,279
optimizing workflow and i think it's

883
00:30:45,279 --> 00:30:46,399
something that we don't spend enough

884
00:30:46,399 --> 00:30:47,240
time on

885
00:30:47,240 --> 00:30:48,480

where you are um i hope i've given you

889
00:30:55,520 --> 00:30:57,360

890
00:30:57,360 --> 00:30:58,000
