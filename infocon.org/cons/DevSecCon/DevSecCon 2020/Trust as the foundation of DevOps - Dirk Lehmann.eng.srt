1
00:00:00,160 --> 00:00:02,399
so

2
00:00:03,199 --> 00:00:07,040
okay um so good morning everyone for me

3
00:00:07,040 --> 00:00:07,919
it's morning

4
00:00:07,919 --> 00:00:10,000
maybe for you it's the evening a welcome

5
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:12,000
and thanks for tuning in into my talk

6
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:13,759
trust as the foundation

7
00:00:13,759 --> 00:00:16,800
of devops you might expect

8
00:00:16,800 --> 00:00:19,920
someone like a psychologist or phd in

9
00:00:19,920 --> 00:00:22,080
sociologists something like that to talk

10
00:00:22,080 --> 00:00:23,279
about trust

11
00:00:23,279 --> 00:00:26,160
actually i'm not i'm just an engineer i

12
00:00:26,160 --> 00:00:28,320
work for a company called sap

13
00:00:28,320 --> 00:00:30,640
and i used to work in teams that were

14
00:00:30,640 --> 00:00:31,439
doing good

15
00:00:31,439 --> 00:00:33,520
and i used to work in teams that were

16
00:00:33,520 --> 00:00:35,840
doing occasion and then i

17
00:00:35,840 --> 00:00:38,000
used to work in teams that are like high

18
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:39,520
performing you might say like

19
00:00:39,520 --> 00:00:41,760
really good and i was wondering why is

20
00:00:41,760 --> 00:00:43,360
that why do we have

21
00:00:43,360 --> 00:00:47,440
um such like gaps or differences in betw

22
00:00:47,440 --> 00:00:50,079
in performance between the teams and

23
00:00:50,079 --> 00:00:50,800
then i

24
00:00:50,800 --> 00:00:52,719
started chatting with my co-workers and

25
00:00:52,719 --> 00:00:54,879
that hey we are like really doing good

26
00:00:54,879 --> 00:00:55,360
in this

27
00:00:55,360 --> 00:00:56,960
like high performing team why do you

28
00:00:56,960 --> 00:00:59,120
think that is and we chatted and sooner

29
00:00:59,120 --> 00:01:00,800
or later like everyone talked about

30
00:01:00,800 --> 00:01:02,000
trust

31
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:04,080
and then i seeked out other teams that

32
00:01:04,080 --> 00:01:05,519
were claiming like yeah we are doing

33
00:01:05,519 --> 00:01:07,439
really good like we are really in a flow

34
00:01:07,439 --> 00:01:09,119
and we like high performing

35
00:01:09,119 --> 00:01:11,200
and i asked them why do you think that

36
00:01:11,200 --> 00:01:13,040
is and sooner or later they talked

37
00:01:13,040 --> 00:01:15,600
they'd use the word trust and i ran

38
00:01:15,600 --> 00:01:17,200
outside the company and i had the same

39
00:01:17,200 --> 00:01:18,320
experience like

40
00:01:18,320 --> 00:01:20,960
people that claimed to work in high

41
00:01:20,960 --> 00:01:22,000
performing teams

42
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:23,759
always sooner or later talked about

43
00:01:23,759 --> 00:01:25,280
trust and then i thought there must be

44
00:01:25,280 --> 00:01:26,159
something like

45
00:01:26,159 --> 00:01:27,840
maybe that's some kind of a secret

46
00:01:27,840 --> 00:01:29,920
source of high performing teams

47
00:01:29,920 --> 00:01:31,600
and then i just did some investigation

48
00:01:31,600 --> 00:01:33,600
on like what is trust and how can we

49
00:01:33,600 --> 00:01:35,439
foster it and such things and basically

50
00:01:35,439 --> 00:01:36,720
the result of that

51
00:01:36,720 --> 00:01:39,280
let's say private research is is what

52
00:01:39,280 --> 00:01:40,159
you will see in

53
00:01:40,159 --> 00:01:43,280
in this talk uh right now

54
00:01:43,280 --> 00:01:47,439
so um yeah let's let's start with like

55
00:01:47,439 --> 00:01:49,680
before we start like what is trust let's

56
00:01:49,680 --> 00:01:51,680
let's assume there is no trust

57
00:01:51,680 --> 00:01:54,240
right so completely the opposite what

58
00:01:54,240 --> 00:01:56,079
what happens if there is no trust in an

59
00:01:56,079 --> 00:01:58,240
organization in the team whatsoever

60
00:01:58,240 --> 00:02:00,000
and i would claim if you don't have

61
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:01,759
trust in in the team on

62
00:02:01,759 --> 00:02:03,840
your organization it's like having the

63
00:02:03,840 --> 00:02:05,920
root of all that's evil in in your team

64
00:02:05,920 --> 00:02:06,399
right

65
00:02:06,399 --> 00:02:09,119
you will see all kind of problems

66
00:02:09,119 --> 00:02:10,080
popping up

67
00:02:10,080 --> 00:02:12,480
that you might not relate directly to to

68
00:02:12,480 --> 00:02:13,840
trust issues

69
00:02:13,840 --> 00:02:15,599
but in fact they are so you get all

70
00:02:15,599 --> 00:02:17,200
kinds of problems for free

71
00:02:17,200 --> 00:02:19,840
on top of it if you just have an absence

72
00:02:19,840 --> 00:02:22,400
of trust or non-existence of trust

73
00:02:22,400 --> 00:02:25,200
in your team um actually that's that's

74
00:02:25,200 --> 00:02:26,959
not done by me i said i did a lot of

75
00:02:26,959 --> 00:02:28,879
like studying reading books and and

76
00:02:28,879 --> 00:02:30,000
talking to people

77
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:32,160
and that is one of the books um it's by

78
00:02:32,160 --> 00:02:33,920
patrick lynchone it's called the five

79
00:02:33,920 --> 00:02:35,519
dysfunctions of a team and

80
00:02:35,519 --> 00:02:39,120
and he pretty nicely pins out that

81
00:02:39,120 --> 00:02:41,760
if you investigate a lot of problems or

82
00:02:41,760 --> 00:02:44,080
dysfunctions as he says

83
00:02:44,080 --> 00:02:46,640
from teams sooner or later you in most

84
00:02:46,640 --> 00:02:48,319
cases you end up with well there's an

85
00:02:48,319 --> 00:02:50,239
absence of trust in the team right

86
00:02:50,239 --> 00:02:52,800
people that don't feel trust with others

87
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:54,319
in in their team

88
00:02:54,319 --> 00:02:58,319
um avoid going into um into hard

89
00:02:58,319 --> 00:03:01,360
conversations or arguments even um

90
00:03:01,360 --> 00:03:03,280
they they are fear of the conflict

91
00:03:03,280 --> 00:03:04,720
because they are

92
00:03:04,720 --> 00:03:08,000
afraid of that might have bad um

93
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:10,159
consequences for them so they don't go

94
00:03:10,159 --> 00:03:11,200
into conflicts

95
00:03:11,200 --> 00:03:13,519
then there are decisions made by the

96
00:03:13,519 --> 00:03:15,840
team that seemed to be consensual but

97
00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:17,599
actually some people didn't never spoke

98
00:03:17,599 --> 00:03:19,440
up because like you know they didn't

99
00:03:19,440 --> 00:03:21,360
feel trust and they didn't feel like um

100
00:03:21,360 --> 00:03:21,760
well

101
00:03:21,760 --> 00:03:24,799
in in speaking up so that the decision

102
00:03:24,799 --> 00:03:26,560
that is taken is not their decision

103
00:03:26,560 --> 00:03:28,560
which leads to they are not committing

104
00:03:28,560 --> 00:03:30,879
to that to that goal or not like 100

105
00:03:30,879 --> 00:03:32,319
percent committing to that goal

106
00:03:32,319 --> 00:03:33,840
so they are completely avoid any

107
00:03:33,840 --> 00:03:35,519
accountability of what has been

108
00:03:35,519 --> 00:03:37,200
discussed or decided there because like

109
00:03:37,200 --> 00:03:39,200
hey that that's something they decided

110
00:03:39,200 --> 00:03:40,959
right and it already starts like

111
00:03:40,959 --> 00:03:44,159
they and i so they decided something um

112
00:03:44,159 --> 00:03:46,159
they will see that it'll fail but they

113
00:03:46,159 --> 00:03:47,200
didn't hear me

114
00:03:47,200 --> 00:03:50,560
or they didn't go into my arguments and

115
00:03:50,560 --> 00:03:53,200
um so this avoidance of accountability

116
00:03:53,200 --> 00:03:53,760
and then

117
00:03:53,760 --> 00:03:56,000
the inattention to results the people do

118
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:58,000
have goals but they might not

119
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:01,360
um be um overlapping or uh um

120
00:04:01,360 --> 00:04:04,080
agree being the same goals that that the

121
00:04:04,080 --> 00:04:04,959
team has

122
00:04:04,959 --> 00:04:07,280
um so you need to to watch out here that

123
00:04:07,280 --> 00:04:09,040
a lot of things that you might

124
00:04:09,040 --> 00:04:12,080
see in in teams that are dysfunctional

125
00:04:12,080 --> 00:04:15,360
uh actually are just um come from from

126
00:04:15,360 --> 00:04:17,680
an absence of trust even though at first

127
00:04:17,680 --> 00:04:20,880
they might not look like that so

128
00:04:20,880 --> 00:04:22,720
trust is important and i'm speaking

129
00:04:22,720 --> 00:04:24,080
about trust already since

130
00:04:24,080 --> 00:04:26,800
since a few minutes so um i think we

131
00:04:26,800 --> 00:04:29,280
should start with defining what trust is

132
00:04:29,280 --> 00:04:31,120
and honestly i tried to do that when

133
00:04:31,120 --> 00:04:33,040
preparing the talk i was like okay let's

134
00:04:33,040 --> 00:04:34,479
let's have a one or two sentence

135
00:04:34,479 --> 00:04:36,000
descriptions of what trust is

136
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:37,680
like it should be easy like your

137
00:04:37,680 --> 00:04:39,600
experience everyone experiences

138
00:04:39,600 --> 00:04:42,000
trust every day in in someone or

139
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:43,360
something and then

140
00:04:43,360 --> 00:04:45,840
um i had really a hard time and like

141
00:04:45,840 --> 00:04:47,199
crunching this

142
00:04:47,199 --> 00:04:50,080
this this thing that i have like all day

143
00:04:50,080 --> 00:04:51,199
i feel it

144
00:04:51,199 --> 00:04:53,440
but putting that into words it's pretty

145
00:04:53,440 --> 00:04:55,600
hard then i looked up wikipedia and then

146
00:04:55,600 --> 00:04:58,240
then sooner or later and wikipedia an

147
00:04:58,240 --> 00:05:00,240
article is quite fine but but it's

148
00:05:00,240 --> 00:05:01,600
pretty comprehensive

149
00:05:01,600 --> 00:05:03,199
and then i came up with this very nice

150
00:05:03,199 --> 00:05:04,960
definition that that i think is it's

151
00:05:04,960 --> 00:05:06,479
pretty good to remember

152
00:05:06,479 --> 00:05:10,320
by dr tway which says trust is the state

153
00:05:10,320 --> 00:05:11,840
of readiness for an unguarded

154
00:05:11,840 --> 00:05:13,520
interaction with someone

155
00:05:13,520 --> 00:05:16,240
or something and and i liked it because

156
00:05:16,240 --> 00:05:16,560
it's

157
00:05:16,560 --> 00:05:19,440
you can trust you can feel trust um to

158
00:05:19,440 --> 00:05:21,440
to other people to someone

159
00:05:21,440 --> 00:05:23,600
and to some things like like like

160
00:05:23,600 --> 00:05:24,960
processes or

161
00:05:24,960 --> 00:05:28,240
very abstract virtual things and even

162
00:05:28,240 --> 00:05:30,720
more this this paper comes up with like

163
00:05:30,720 --> 00:05:33,360
the three elements that they think um

164
00:05:33,360 --> 00:05:34,160
trust is

165
00:05:34,160 --> 00:05:36,960
i'm constructed and the first one is a

166
00:05:36,960 --> 00:05:38,479
capacity for trusting

167
00:05:38,479 --> 00:05:41,039
this adds in this this like what is my

168
00:05:41,039 --> 00:05:43,199
experience my past experience like what

169
00:05:43,199 --> 00:05:44,560
is my history with

170
00:05:44,560 --> 00:05:46,479
someone or something so something that i

171
00:05:46,479 --> 00:05:47,759
need to to build

172
00:05:47,759 --> 00:05:50,720
trust um so i'll give you an example if

173
00:05:50,720 --> 00:05:52,400
if you've never flew before never

174
00:05:52,400 --> 00:05:53,680
entered an airplane

175
00:05:53,680 --> 00:05:55,680
um you might be a bit nervous like i'm

176
00:05:55,680 --> 00:05:58,160
you're uncertain like what's going on

177
00:05:58,160 --> 00:06:00,000
um you feel high acceleration and it

178
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:01,280
goes up into the air

179
00:06:01,280 --> 00:06:03,440
and things are just strange and you

180
00:06:03,440 --> 00:06:04,720
don't you're not used to it

181
00:06:04,720 --> 00:06:06,560
you don't have a history that was always

182
00:06:06,560 --> 00:06:09,039
that you your trust level might be not

183
00:06:09,039 --> 00:06:10,960
that high but if you have fluent 100

184
00:06:10,960 --> 00:06:11,680
times

185
00:06:11,680 --> 00:06:13,120
uh your trust level is pretty high

186
00:06:13,120 --> 00:06:15,600
because your history was always good

187
00:06:15,600 --> 00:06:17,759
with the system of aviation right so

188
00:06:17,759 --> 00:06:19,759
you're like yeah i'm trusting the system

189
00:06:19,759 --> 00:06:22,400
so that is one element but even if

190
00:06:22,400 --> 00:06:23,600
that's in place

191
00:06:23,600 --> 00:06:25,680
but you are not feeling competence into

192
00:06:25,680 --> 00:06:27,600
the system you might have an issue with

193
00:06:27,600 --> 00:06:28,479
trust again

194
00:06:28,479 --> 00:06:31,360
so um like when i'm not sure about you

195
00:06:31,360 --> 00:06:32,720
but when i enter your plane

196
00:06:32,720 --> 00:06:34,319
and i have to turn right to reach my

197
00:06:34,319 --> 00:06:35,919
seat i always have a look left where the

198
00:06:35,919 --> 00:06:37,199
cockpit is right and then

199
00:06:37,199 --> 00:06:39,919
i'm what if i would see the pilots there

200
00:06:39,919 --> 00:06:42,160
over a box of beer having a good time

201
00:06:42,160 --> 00:06:44,479
i would feel well maybe i have flown 100

202
00:06:44,479 --> 00:06:46,160
times before and everything was fine so

203
00:06:46,160 --> 00:06:47,120
basically i have

204
00:06:47,120 --> 00:06:49,520
trust in the system of aviation but i'm

205
00:06:49,520 --> 00:06:50,880
not sure whether the people in the

206
00:06:50,880 --> 00:06:52,639
cockpit are currently competent to fly

207
00:06:52,639 --> 00:06:54,240
the plane right and then my trust level

208
00:06:54,240 --> 00:06:55,759
goes down

209
00:06:55,759 --> 00:06:56,880
and the third one is like the

210
00:06:56,880 --> 00:06:58,880
perceptions of intention so i have flew

211
00:06:58,880 --> 00:07:00,960
in 100 times everything was fine

212
00:07:00,960 --> 00:07:03,120
i entered a plane i look left the pilots

213
00:07:03,120 --> 00:07:04,000
look like

214
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:06,080
ass pilots right like this tom cruise

215
00:07:06,080 --> 00:07:08,000
guys like sunglasses and like

216
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:10,240
really like they are capable of handling

217
00:07:10,240 --> 00:07:11,280
every situation

218
00:07:11,280 --> 00:07:13,520
i turn left i reach my seat and i

219
00:07:13,520 --> 00:07:15,280
scratch my head nana sings

220
00:07:15,280 --> 00:07:18,080
maybe they they look as being competent

221
00:07:18,080 --> 00:07:19,199
flying a plane

222
00:07:19,199 --> 00:07:22,000
but what if their intentions are not my

223
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:23,919
intentions what if they would like to

224
00:07:23,919 --> 00:07:26,479
do some loopings or zero g curves or

225
00:07:26,479 --> 00:07:27,199
whatever

226
00:07:27,199 --> 00:07:28,800
things that i don't want i just want to

227
00:07:28,800 --> 00:07:30,479
go safely from a to b

228
00:07:30,479 --> 00:07:32,240
so and then again my trust level would

229
00:07:32,240 --> 00:07:34,400
go down right so you have to have

230
00:07:34,400 --> 00:07:35,680
you have to come up with these three

231
00:07:35,680 --> 00:07:37,520
elements to to

232
00:07:37,520 --> 00:07:39,680
feel trust and i think with that we have

233
00:07:39,680 --> 00:07:41,759
a pretty good definition

234
00:07:41,759 --> 00:07:43,520
of what trust is how it could be

235
00:07:43,520 --> 00:07:45,440
described and how it's built and how

236
00:07:45,440 --> 00:07:46,879
it's made up

237
00:07:46,879 --> 00:07:50,160
um but as an engineer um and and that's

238
00:07:50,160 --> 00:07:53,039
what i am um i want to measure things

239
00:07:53,039 --> 00:07:54,479
you know that's that's still

240
00:07:54,479 --> 00:07:56,960
fluffy so how could we measure things

241
00:07:56,960 --> 00:07:58,080
how could we quantify

242
00:07:58,080 --> 00:08:01,440
that is that possible and i found that

243
00:08:01,440 --> 00:08:04,479
you could somehow measure trust

244
00:08:04,479 --> 00:08:07,759
in the unit of speed meaning um

245
00:08:07,759 --> 00:08:10,720
in our industry um fast deployment fi

246
00:08:10,720 --> 00:08:11,599
times fast

247
00:08:11,599 --> 00:08:14,080
mean time to recovery so everything that

248
00:08:14,080 --> 00:08:15,599
is fast decision making

249
00:08:15,599 --> 00:08:18,879
fast execution is in teams

250
00:08:18,879 --> 00:08:22,160
that goes back um to

251
00:08:22,160 --> 00:08:24,639
to trust command and control structures

252
00:08:24,639 --> 00:08:25,199
always

253
00:08:25,199 --> 00:08:27,840
take time and they can't come come up

254
00:08:27,840 --> 00:08:30,160
with that speed that trust can do

255
00:08:30,160 --> 00:08:32,080
and actually again there's another book

256
00:08:32,080 --> 00:08:34,159
um by stephen covey it's called the

257
00:08:34,159 --> 00:08:36,320
speed of trust um that is full of

258
00:08:36,320 --> 00:08:37,839
examples throughout

259
00:08:37,839 --> 00:08:40,958
industries and and and situations

260
00:08:40,958 --> 00:08:44,000
um contract negotiations and

261
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:47,839
whatnot um to just um

262
00:08:47,839 --> 00:08:50,959
prove that um if you add trust in a

263
00:08:50,959 --> 00:08:51,839
system

264
00:08:51,839 --> 00:08:54,480
things will go faster and i think this

265
00:08:54,480 --> 00:08:54,880
is

266
00:08:54,880 --> 00:08:58,480
this is crucial for for us talking about

267
00:08:58,480 --> 00:09:00,560
going into high frequent deployments

268
00:09:00,560 --> 00:09:02,399
talking about continuous delivery

269
00:09:02,399 --> 00:09:03,680
talking about a lot of what

270
00:09:03,680 --> 00:09:07,120
what devops um pardon me tries to do

271
00:09:07,120 --> 00:09:10,959
because um you need to have a culture

272
00:09:10,959 --> 00:09:11,839
that is

273
00:09:11,839 --> 00:09:14,080
that is that can deal with the speed

274
00:09:14,080 --> 00:09:14,959
technology gives

275
00:09:14,959 --> 00:09:16,800
us today we have we have deployment

276
00:09:16,800 --> 00:09:18,800
pipelines we have container container

277
00:09:18,800 --> 00:09:19,600
platforms

278
00:09:19,600 --> 00:09:21,360
a lot of things that help us

279
00:09:21,360 --> 00:09:23,440
accelerating things and doing things in

280
00:09:23,440 --> 00:09:24,480
a fast manner

281
00:09:24,480 --> 00:09:26,560
but at the end if our culture cannot

282
00:09:26,560 --> 00:09:29,120
come come up with that speed

283
00:09:29,120 --> 00:09:31,440
we have the tools and like be ready to

284
00:09:31,440 --> 00:09:33,040
ship that one light of code change

285
00:09:33,040 --> 00:09:34,959
within seconds or minutes to the

286
00:09:34,959 --> 00:09:36,640
productive system

287
00:09:36,640 --> 00:09:39,519
but as i had it when i was coaching a

288
00:09:39,519 --> 00:09:40,080
team

289
00:09:40,080 --> 00:09:41,760
we were squeezing out the minutes from

290
00:09:41,760 --> 00:09:43,360
the pipeline seeing okay how can we do

291
00:09:43,360 --> 00:09:44,720
the pipeline faster and at the end of

292
00:09:44,720 --> 00:09:46,480
the process when we had to when we when

293
00:09:46,480 --> 00:09:48,240
we created the artifact i said okay now

294
00:09:48,240 --> 00:09:49,760
let's deploy and they said no we can't i

295
00:09:49,760 --> 00:09:50,640
said why

296
00:09:50,640 --> 00:09:52,959
yeah we have to write a mail it to this

297
00:09:52,959 --> 00:09:54,480
guy and that guy

298
00:09:54,480 --> 00:09:55,680
and then we have to wait for the

299
00:09:55,680 --> 00:09:57,600
confirmation and then we measured that

300
00:09:57,600 --> 00:10:00,320
time and that in average took 46 hours

301
00:10:00,320 --> 00:10:02,240
and said like why we were squeezing out

302
00:10:02,240 --> 00:10:04,480
minutes in the pipeline when the process

303
00:10:04,480 --> 00:10:08,160
lacks in speed in speed so we need to

304
00:10:08,160 --> 00:10:10,240
establish a culture of trust here

305
00:10:10,240 --> 00:10:12,880
so that we can leverage that speed and

306
00:10:12,880 --> 00:10:14,160
that we can deal with the

307
00:10:14,160 --> 00:10:16,079
with the with the speed that the tools

308
00:10:16,079 --> 00:10:17,680
give us

309
00:10:17,680 --> 00:10:21,040
right so um trust is so important in our

310
00:10:21,040 --> 00:10:22,079
discussion here

311
00:10:22,079 --> 00:10:25,360
because it it is directly bound to speed

312
00:10:25,360 --> 00:10:26,240
and you want

313
00:10:26,240 --> 00:10:29,200
to go into um faster feedback cycles

314
00:10:29,200 --> 00:10:30,880
with your customers most likely and

315
00:10:30,880 --> 00:10:33,920
for that you need to you know optimize

316
00:10:33,920 --> 00:10:34,640
this

317
00:10:34,640 --> 00:10:37,920
um these processes and by using a

318
00:10:37,920 --> 00:10:39,600
culture of trust

319
00:10:39,600 --> 00:10:41,760
so if trust is that important if we and

320
00:10:41,760 --> 00:10:44,000
if we have defined trust now i think

321
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:45,920
the the main question is okay but how

322
00:10:45,920 --> 00:10:47,680
can we build trust right

323
00:10:47,680 --> 00:10:50,640
and here comes the point i have no clue

324
00:10:50,640 --> 00:10:51,279
i didn't

325
00:10:51,279 --> 00:10:52,959
i tell i told you i'm a software

326
00:10:52,959 --> 00:10:54,640
engineer i'm not a psychologist or

327
00:10:54,640 --> 00:10:56,240
anything so i can't tell you

328
00:10:56,240 --> 00:10:58,160
i can tell you how you destroy trust but

329
00:10:58,160 --> 00:11:00,399
maybe that's something you already know

330
00:11:00,399 --> 00:11:03,040
so what i can offer you is um talk a

331
00:11:03,040 --> 00:11:05,200
little about how you could foster trust

332
00:11:05,200 --> 00:11:07,920
and one of this the first like elements

333
00:11:07,920 --> 00:11:08,959
that i think

334
00:11:08,959 --> 00:11:10,880
that we need to foster trust is team

335
00:11:10,880 --> 00:11:12,720
size we need to have a look on team size

336
00:11:12,720 --> 00:11:14,079
and team size is so important

337
00:11:14,079 --> 00:11:16,160
because it directly relates to

338
00:11:16,160 --> 00:11:17,920
communication structures and again this

339
00:11:17,920 --> 00:11:19,440
is not new this is something

340
00:11:19,440 --> 00:11:21,920
that you can always also already find in

341
00:11:21,920 --> 00:11:23,279
in this book coming from the

342
00:11:23,279 --> 00:11:25,279
from the mid 70s by fred brooks the

343
00:11:25,279 --> 00:11:26,640
musical man months

344
00:11:26,640 --> 00:11:28,079
if you're into project management

345
00:11:28,079 --> 00:11:29,920
somehow you should read that book

346
00:11:29,920 --> 00:11:31,839
or maybe buy two copies of the book and

347
00:11:31,839 --> 00:11:34,240
you can retry it twice as fast

348
00:11:34,240 --> 00:11:36,720
but what the book actually says like the

349
00:11:36,720 --> 00:11:38,720
main line is if you add manpower to late

350
00:11:38,720 --> 00:11:40,800
software project it makes it even later

351
00:11:40,800 --> 00:11:42,000
which is like

352
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:44,320
i'm contradicting our natural experience

353
00:11:44,320 --> 00:11:46,240
right if you dig a hole it takes a whole

354
00:11:46,240 --> 00:11:46,720
day

355
00:11:46,720 --> 00:11:48,240
if you dig the hole with two people it

356
00:11:48,240 --> 00:11:50,560
takes half a day but why is that with

357
00:11:50,560 --> 00:11:51,600
software project

358
00:11:51,600 --> 00:11:53,839
that it's always like you add people and

359
00:11:53,839 --> 00:11:55,360
then it just goes later

360
00:11:55,360 --> 00:11:57,920
why is that and brook says well it all

361
00:11:57,920 --> 00:12:00,560
has to do with the communication

362
00:12:00,560 --> 00:12:01,600
and he comes up with this

363
00:12:01,600 --> 00:12:03,120
intercommunication formula that

364
00:12:03,120 --> 00:12:04,720
basically says the more people you have

365
00:12:04,720 --> 00:12:06,639
in the team the more communication lines

366
00:12:06,639 --> 00:12:07,279
you have

367
00:12:07,279 --> 00:12:09,279
and the more the communication overhead

368
00:12:09,279 --> 00:12:10,320
or the

369
00:12:10,320 --> 00:12:12,079
resources that you take to do have a

370
00:12:12,079 --> 00:12:13,519
good communication it goes up by this

371
00:12:13,519 --> 00:12:14,079
career

372
00:12:14,079 --> 00:12:15,519
so basically if you have three persons

373
00:12:15,519 --> 00:12:17,040
and you have three connections with four

374
00:12:17,040 --> 00:12:17,760
it's already six

375
00:12:17,760 --> 00:12:19,680
and with five you already have ten you

376
00:12:19,680 --> 00:12:20,959
see where that goes

377
00:12:20,959 --> 00:12:24,160
so there is some some limit some natural

378
00:12:24,160 --> 00:12:26,320
limit where just communication overlaps

379
00:12:26,320 --> 00:12:27,040
any

380
00:12:27,040 --> 00:12:29,839
um productivity improvers that you get

381
00:12:29,839 --> 00:12:31,519
by adding people to the project because

382
00:12:31,519 --> 00:12:32,240
they need to

383
00:12:32,240 --> 00:12:34,880
communicate more and the question now is

384
00:12:34,880 --> 00:12:35,519
okay

385
00:12:35,519 --> 00:12:37,760
where is that limit like what is a good

386
00:12:37,760 --> 00:12:40,000
size for a team and this is where

387
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:42,480
that gentleman can could help us out um

388
00:12:42,480 --> 00:12:43,839
robin dunbar who

389
00:12:43,839 --> 00:12:46,399
is a psychologist who did some

390
00:12:46,399 --> 00:12:47,760
investigations

391
00:12:47,760 --> 00:12:50,480
and found something that became famous

392
00:12:50,480 --> 00:12:52,000
as dunbar's number which is

393
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:54,160
a cognitive limit to the number of

394
00:12:54,160 --> 00:12:56,399
people with whom one can maintain

395
00:12:56,399 --> 00:12:59,440
stable social relationships uh and that

396
00:12:59,440 --> 00:13:02,240
number is at 150. and and basically what

397
00:13:02,240 --> 00:13:03,200
he did he

398
00:13:03,200 --> 00:13:05,519
investigated into social structures of

399
00:13:05,519 --> 00:13:06,240
people

400
00:13:06,240 --> 00:13:08,720
teams groups organizations and always

401
00:13:08,720 --> 00:13:09,519
found

402
00:13:09,519 --> 00:13:11,519
that there is a like a boundary of

403
00:13:11,519 --> 00:13:13,839
around 150 that seems to be the

404
00:13:13,839 --> 00:13:15,760
the limit for the average person that's

405
00:13:15,760 --> 00:13:17,360
important here like always the average

406
00:13:17,360 --> 00:13:17,839
person

407
00:13:17,839 --> 00:13:20,160
but the average person that could

408
00:13:20,160 --> 00:13:22,079
maintain stable social relationships for

409
00:13:22,079 --> 00:13:22,800
example

410
00:13:22,800 --> 00:13:25,920
the villages of stone-aged men they

411
00:13:25,920 --> 00:13:29,200
never had the size that they um exceeded

412
00:13:29,200 --> 00:13:31,760
more than roughly 150 persons so this

413
00:13:31,760 --> 00:13:34,079
village's stone age man could host 150

414
00:13:34,079 --> 00:13:36,399
persons and then it seems like you can't

415
00:13:36,399 --> 00:13:39,040
find larger villages of stone aged men

416
00:13:39,040 --> 00:13:41,120
also in in the military the smallest

417
00:13:41,120 --> 00:13:43,199
tactical unit in the roman army

418
00:13:43,199 --> 00:13:45,120
the so-called money pail had a size of

419
00:13:45,120 --> 00:13:46,560
150.

420
00:13:46,560 --> 00:13:49,519
and so and so he had a lot of um um

421
00:13:49,519 --> 00:13:51,120
proof points where he could always see

422
00:13:51,120 --> 00:13:52,880
it's always 150 where

423
00:13:52,880 --> 00:13:55,519
where stable social structures just

424
00:13:55,519 --> 00:13:56,800
split up

425
00:13:56,800 --> 00:13:58,959
and and interesting for us is this um

426
00:13:58,959 --> 00:14:00,720
what dunbar also says he says the

427
00:14:00,720 --> 00:14:02,720
average again the average person has

428
00:14:02,720 --> 00:14:04,320
five intimate friends then

429
00:14:04,320 --> 00:14:07,040
15 trusted friends 35 close friends and

430
00:14:07,040 --> 00:14:08,079
150

431
00:14:08,079 --> 00:14:11,120
casual friends to help to have stable

432
00:14:11,120 --> 00:14:12,800
social relationships with right

433
00:14:12,800 --> 00:14:14,560
everything beyond that is not considered

434
00:14:14,560 --> 00:14:17,040
according to dunbar not to be a stable

435
00:14:17,040 --> 00:14:18,480
social relationships and he even

436
00:14:18,480 --> 00:14:20,320
provided a paper some years back

437
00:14:20,320 --> 00:14:22,240
that was with the social networks and

438
00:14:22,240 --> 00:14:23,680
everything that we have today

439
00:14:23,680 --> 00:14:25,920
you can still find these numbers to be

440
00:14:25,920 --> 00:14:27,040
true

441
00:14:27,040 --> 00:14:28,399
interesting for our discussion here is

442
00:14:28,399 --> 00:14:30,240
these 50 trusted friends right and that

443
00:14:30,240 --> 00:14:31,760
already includes the five intimate

444
00:14:31,760 --> 00:14:32,800
friends that leaves

445
00:14:32,800 --> 00:14:35,360
us to additional 10 people that we could

446
00:14:35,360 --> 00:14:36,240
have stable

447
00:14:36,240 --> 00:14:39,839
trustful relationships to right 10. hey

448
00:14:39,839 --> 00:14:41,199
that's the that's basically the

449
00:14:41,199 --> 00:14:43,040
scientific proof why we always talk

450
00:14:43,040 --> 00:14:44,720
about teams of 10 while we talk about

451
00:14:44,720 --> 00:14:46,320
two pizza teams and all that

452
00:14:46,320 --> 00:14:49,519
this is like the reason for that this is

453
00:14:49,519 --> 00:14:52,560
the average person can maintain 10

454
00:14:52,560 --> 00:14:55,600
around 10 stable trustful relationships

455
00:14:55,600 --> 00:14:57,279
to other people and if you want to have

456
00:14:57,279 --> 00:14:58,079
stressful

457
00:14:58,079 --> 00:15:00,079
relationships then you can leverage the

458
00:15:00,079 --> 00:15:02,320
speed and have you know have a good

459
00:15:02,320 --> 00:15:05,760
uh culture in your team so if your team

460
00:15:05,760 --> 00:15:08,000
is not functioning that well have a look

461
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:10,000
into team size maybe communication that

462
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:11,120
cannot

463
00:15:11,120 --> 00:15:14,800
go as directly as optimal as it should

464
00:15:14,800 --> 00:15:15,600
be

465
00:15:15,600 --> 00:15:18,880
because your team is just too large

466
00:15:18,880 --> 00:15:21,760
the second element for me um how you

467
00:15:21,760 --> 00:15:24,160
could foster trust is diversity right

468
00:15:24,160 --> 00:15:26,000
believe it or not even the geekiest

469
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:27,680
nerdist person that you know

470
00:15:27,680 --> 00:15:30,959
is a social person like everyone is

471
00:15:30,959 --> 00:15:31,440
right

472
00:15:31,440 --> 00:15:34,399
that's just our human part of human

473
00:15:34,399 --> 00:15:35,279
being

474
00:15:35,279 --> 00:15:37,199
some people need more social

475
00:15:37,199 --> 00:15:39,360
interactions some are less

476
00:15:39,360 --> 00:15:42,720
but everyone needs it right and so never

477
00:15:42,720 --> 00:15:44,720
underestimate the power of an evening

478
00:15:44,720 --> 00:15:46,320
beer with your colleagues so

479
00:15:46,320 --> 00:15:48,480
i'm german for us it's the evening beer

480
00:15:48,480 --> 00:15:50,560
for you it might be the afternoon tea or

481
00:15:50,560 --> 00:15:52,079
what have you but i've never

482
00:15:52,079 --> 00:15:53,600
underestimate this

483
00:15:53,600 --> 00:15:56,000
social bindings that you create with

484
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:58,000
like especially out of the office

485
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:01,199
events with your colleagues that help

486
00:16:01,199 --> 00:16:02,880
um building trust and building

487
00:16:02,880 --> 00:16:04,560
relationships in general

488
00:16:04,560 --> 00:16:07,680
that much and if you see organizations

489
00:16:07,680 --> 00:16:10,000
like that you know like functional silos

490
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:11,600
spread around the world

491
00:16:11,600 --> 00:16:15,199
various time zones this is actually

492
00:16:15,199 --> 00:16:17,440
quite perfect if you want to foster

493
00:16:17,440 --> 00:16:19,839
stereotypes and biases

494
00:16:19,839 --> 00:16:22,399
and never underestimate the gaps in time

495
00:16:22,399 --> 00:16:23,839
and space that you create

496
00:16:23,839 --> 00:16:27,440
and create or that you put here between

497
00:16:27,440 --> 00:16:29,519
people and i know all the arguments of

498
00:16:29,519 --> 00:16:31,120
like yeah but we have all these new

499
00:16:31,120 --> 00:16:32,800
communication structures and especially

500
00:16:32,800 --> 00:16:34,240
these days everyone does video

501
00:16:34,240 --> 00:16:35,759
conferences and

502
00:16:35,759 --> 00:16:38,720
you know all these new ways of

503
00:16:38,720 --> 00:16:40,000
communication right

504
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:42,639
so we can solve it with that no because

505
00:16:42,639 --> 00:16:44,079
what you're talking about with these

506
00:16:44,079 --> 00:16:45,600
tools is communication

507
00:16:45,600 --> 00:16:46,959
what i'm talking about is social

508
00:16:46,959 --> 00:16:49,360
interaction and communication is a

509
00:16:49,360 --> 00:16:52,639
huge part of social interaction but um

510
00:16:52,639 --> 00:16:55,839
it's not it's not the whole um

511
00:16:55,839 --> 00:16:59,680
part of social interaction so again that

512
00:16:59,680 --> 00:17:01,600
setups organizational setups like this

513
00:17:01,600 --> 00:17:03,199
are perfect to foster biases and

514
00:17:03,199 --> 00:17:04,000
stereotypes

515
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:06,880
because basically any arbitrary

516
00:17:06,880 --> 00:17:07,599
virtually

517
00:17:07,599 --> 00:17:10,240
meaningless distinction between groups

518
00:17:10,240 --> 00:17:12,160
can can separate people and that's

519
00:17:12,160 --> 00:17:13,919
actually what you do with such an

520
00:17:13,919 --> 00:17:15,760
organization setup and that goes back to

521
00:17:15,760 --> 00:17:17,919
the work of of a gentleman called henry

522
00:17:17,919 --> 00:17:19,039
tafil

523
00:17:19,039 --> 00:17:22,000
um henry tafel um he developed a series

524
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:23,679
about social groups like how do

525
00:17:23,679 --> 00:17:25,679
people feel related to groups like

526
00:17:25,679 --> 00:17:27,439
formal groups like you sign a contract

527
00:17:27,439 --> 00:17:28,799
for example with the company

528
00:17:28,799 --> 00:17:30,799
then you are part of that group of the

529
00:17:30,799 --> 00:17:32,240
employers of that company

530
00:17:32,240 --> 00:17:34,320
or you have informal groups like you

531
00:17:34,320 --> 00:17:35,760
never signed a contract it's just a

532
00:17:35,760 --> 00:17:36,880
feeling something that

533
00:17:36,880 --> 00:17:38,960
you basically in your brain you relate

534
00:17:38,960 --> 00:17:40,960
to be part of that group if you cheer up

535
00:17:40,960 --> 00:17:41,440
for

536
00:17:41,440 --> 00:17:43,919
for a soccer club um most likely you

537
00:17:43,919 --> 00:17:46,000
didn't never sign a contract with any

538
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:47,760
fan club or anything you're just like

539
00:17:47,760 --> 00:17:49,600
yeah i'm feeling related to everyone who

540
00:17:49,600 --> 00:17:51,120
cheers up for the same football club

541
00:17:51,120 --> 00:17:52,080
right

542
00:17:52,080 --> 00:17:55,440
and um and and and one of his studies um

543
00:17:55,440 --> 00:17:57,120
revealed that as i said virtually

544
00:17:57,120 --> 00:17:58,960
meaningless um distinction between

545
00:17:58,960 --> 00:18:00,000
groups

546
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:02,080
such as preferences for paintings or

547
00:18:02,080 --> 00:18:04,480
colors of shirt can trigger a tendency

548
00:18:04,480 --> 00:18:06,960
to favor one owns group to the expense

549
00:18:06,960 --> 00:18:07,679
of others

550
00:18:07,679 --> 00:18:10,160
and that that experiment became or that

551
00:18:10,160 --> 00:18:12,000
siri became known as the minimal group

552
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:14,160
peridot i gave you an example on

553
00:18:14,160 --> 00:18:16,720
what i mean so the basic experiment and

554
00:18:16,720 --> 00:18:18,480
this has been conducted over and over

555
00:18:18,480 --> 00:18:20,640
again with slight modifications and

556
00:18:20,640 --> 00:18:23,760
but it always revealed the same truth so

557
00:18:23,760 --> 00:18:25,919
the experiment goes like that you have a

558
00:18:25,919 --> 00:18:27,840
group of random people that don't know

559
00:18:27,840 --> 00:18:28,640
each other

560
00:18:28,640 --> 00:18:31,440
um and you pass them red or queen shirts

561
00:18:31,440 --> 00:18:33,039
randomly you don't tell them that it's

562
00:18:33,039 --> 00:18:33,600
randomly

563
00:18:33,600 --> 00:18:35,760
just like you might flip a coin or

564
00:18:35,760 --> 00:18:36,640
something but

565
00:18:36,640 --> 00:18:39,200
um person one gets a red shirt red shirt

566
00:18:39,200 --> 00:18:40,559
green shirt green shirt red shirt

567
00:18:40,559 --> 00:18:42,160
whatever it's it's random

568
00:18:42,160 --> 00:18:45,440
um and you don't say anything further to

569
00:18:45,440 --> 00:18:46,799
the people just here you have a red

570
00:18:46,799 --> 00:18:48,640
shirt you will get a green shirt

571
00:18:48,640 --> 00:18:50,799
and then you then you um tell the people

572
00:18:50,799 --> 00:18:52,960
okay can they can distribute the reward

573
00:18:52,960 --> 00:18:55,760
um according to two methods method a is

574
00:18:55,760 --> 00:18:56,480
everyone

575
00:18:56,480 --> 00:18:58,640
gets a hundred euros whether they wear a

576
00:18:58,640 --> 00:19:00,160
green shirt or red shirts or the same

577
00:19:00,160 --> 00:19:01,679
shirt as you wear on a

578
00:19:01,679 --> 00:19:03,520
yeah a red shirt or maybe a green shirt

579
00:19:03,520 --> 00:19:05,600
doesn't matter everyone gets 100 euros

580
00:19:05,600 --> 00:19:06,160
or

581
00:19:06,160 --> 00:19:08,000
you say well everyone who has the same

582
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:10,160
colored shirt as you get 60 euros

583
00:19:10,160 --> 00:19:13,600
right and the other ones that don't wear

584
00:19:13,600 --> 00:19:15,520
the same color turret rescue they only

585
00:19:15,520 --> 00:19:17,200
get 40 euros

586
00:19:17,200 --> 00:19:19,039
and again and again it proves that

587
00:19:19,039 --> 00:19:21,120
people tend to go for option b

588
00:19:21,120 --> 00:19:23,039
even that means well you could get 100

589
00:19:23,039 --> 00:19:24,720
euros if you just distribute them evenly

590
00:19:24,720 --> 00:19:25,760
across everyone

591
00:19:25,760 --> 00:19:28,080
people say no i want to have you know my

592
00:19:28,080 --> 00:19:28,880
group

593
00:19:28,880 --> 00:19:31,120
a little favor and do them a little

594
00:19:31,120 --> 00:19:32,000
favor and

595
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:35,120
and give my group 60 euros um even if

596
00:19:35,120 --> 00:19:36,799
that's to the expense of my own group

597
00:19:36,799 --> 00:19:38,640
because we could have 100 years but 60

598
00:19:38,640 --> 00:19:40,400
years is fine as long as the

599
00:19:40,400 --> 00:19:44,640
others only have 40 euros right and

600
00:19:44,640 --> 00:19:47,679
this this this

601
00:19:47,679 --> 00:19:50,240
this means that that people without

602
00:19:50,240 --> 00:19:52,240
having a context of why they feel

603
00:19:52,240 --> 00:19:54,080
being part of that group and they didn't

604
00:19:54,080 --> 00:19:55,679
sign a contract and i said it's randomly

605
00:19:55,679 --> 00:19:56,799
whether they have read or green shirt

606
00:19:56,799 --> 00:19:58,240
and we didn't tell them what to do with

607
00:19:58,240 --> 00:19:59,200
the money or anything

608
00:19:59,200 --> 00:20:01,840
no they just want to bring their group

609
00:20:01,840 --> 00:20:02,559
um in a

610
00:20:02,559 --> 00:20:04,320
in a better position than people in

611
00:20:04,320 --> 00:20:06,159
their out groups or people that are not

612
00:20:06,159 --> 00:20:06,960
in their group

613
00:20:06,960 --> 00:20:09,039
and look what this could do in

614
00:20:09,039 --> 00:20:10,799
organizations like that right

615
00:20:10,799 --> 00:20:13,440
all these games of us versus them like

616
00:20:13,440 --> 00:20:14,320
development doesn't

617
00:20:14,320 --> 00:20:16,240
understand operations the ops does not

618
00:20:16,240 --> 00:20:17,919
understand what the business says and so

619
00:20:17,919 --> 00:20:19,760
on and so forth this all

620
00:20:19,760 --> 00:20:22,799
us versus them that's the explanation of

621
00:20:22,799 --> 00:20:23,200
that

622
00:20:23,200 --> 00:20:24,880
and that's just the trust killer so

623
00:20:24,880 --> 00:20:26,640
never put people

624
00:20:26,640 --> 00:20:28,720
that that work on the same product or

625
00:20:28,720 --> 00:20:30,640
service in functional silos

626
00:20:30,640 --> 00:20:33,520
um as this will start this tendency of

627
00:20:33,520 --> 00:20:34,080
like

628
00:20:34,080 --> 00:20:37,120
i'm rating my own group higher than

629
00:20:37,120 --> 00:20:39,200
than the overall goal that you're trying

630
00:20:39,200 --> 00:20:40,240
to achieve and that's

631
00:20:40,240 --> 00:20:43,039
why these um cross-functional autonomous

632
00:20:43,039 --> 00:20:45,120
teams are so successful because

633
00:20:45,120 --> 00:20:48,880
they bind themselves to not my role like

634
00:20:48,880 --> 00:20:49,919
hey i'm the ops

635
00:20:49,919 --> 00:20:53,120
guy or the dev guy no my role is like

636
00:20:53,120 --> 00:20:55,039
making that service making that software

637
00:20:55,039 --> 00:20:56,480
component what have you making that

638
00:20:56,480 --> 00:20:57,120
product

639
00:20:57,120 --> 00:21:00,559
making that good and work great

640
00:21:00,559 --> 00:21:02,240
and this is my aim and this is where i

641
00:21:02,240 --> 00:21:03,840
take my pride in

642
00:21:03,840 --> 00:21:06,159
um so so people that work on the same

643
00:21:06,159 --> 00:21:06,960
product

644
00:21:06,960 --> 00:21:09,840
should be part of the same team and in

645
00:21:09,840 --> 00:21:10,880
best cases

646
00:21:10,880 --> 00:21:12,640
in the same location so that they can

647
00:21:12,640 --> 00:21:14,400
really like get this

648
00:21:14,400 --> 00:21:16,640
this feeling of yeah this is what where

649
00:21:16,640 --> 00:21:18,400
we all take pride in that we

650
00:21:18,400 --> 00:21:21,120
all work on and another thing is from

651
00:21:21,120 --> 00:21:22,240
from that as i said

652
00:21:22,240 --> 00:21:24,640
it's it's it's heterogeneous people like

653
00:21:24,640 --> 00:21:26,240
all kind of people with all kind of

654
00:21:26,240 --> 00:21:28,080
background from the from the business to

655
00:21:28,080 --> 00:21:29,600
the deaf to the operations to the

656
00:21:29,600 --> 00:21:31,679
quality

657
00:21:31,679 --> 00:21:33,679
you know people from from the aha moment

658
00:21:33,679 --> 00:21:35,200
to the catching moment the moment where

659
00:21:35,200 --> 00:21:36,880
you have your idea your business service

660
00:21:36,880 --> 00:21:38,720
whatever idea the aha moment

661
00:21:38,720 --> 00:21:40,320
to the catching moment where your end

662
00:21:40,320 --> 00:21:42,000
user use your software

663
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:43,919
all of these people in that value stream

664
00:21:43,919 --> 00:21:45,600
you you you have to

665
00:21:45,600 --> 00:21:47,919
to to take along to take pride in what

666
00:21:47,919 --> 00:21:49,200
they are doing

667
00:21:49,200 --> 00:21:51,360
and and that means great teams are

668
00:21:51,360 --> 00:21:53,120
always heterogeneous right everyone can

669
00:21:53,120 --> 00:21:54,240
bring to the table

670
00:21:54,240 --> 00:21:58,000
what what they are good in um and

671
00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:00,640
there isn't it any successful team that

672
00:22:00,640 --> 00:22:01,919
isn't heterogeneous like

673
00:22:01,919 --> 00:22:04,720
look in sports look at a soccer football

674
00:22:04,720 --> 00:22:06,480
team only consisting of goalkeepers

675
00:22:06,480 --> 00:22:08,000
wouldn't be successful look at

676
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:10,000
rock and roll bands only consisting of

677
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:11,440
fast players

678
00:22:11,440 --> 00:22:14,480
strange music interesting but not very

679
00:22:14,480 --> 00:22:16,400
enjoyable to listen to at least for a

680
00:22:16,400 --> 00:22:17,280
long time

681
00:22:17,280 --> 00:22:21,120
so great teams are always heterogeneous

682
00:22:21,120 --> 00:22:25,520
um my third and last um

683
00:22:25,520 --> 00:22:29,200
advice on how you could foster trust

684
00:22:29,200 --> 00:22:32,320
is safety and safety comes in in various

685
00:22:32,320 --> 00:22:35,840
flavors the one is like a positive

686
00:22:35,840 --> 00:22:38,159
failure culture and i don't know about

687
00:22:38,159 --> 00:22:40,080
you but when i studied on

688
00:22:40,080 --> 00:22:42,159
engineering software engineering they

689
00:22:42,159 --> 00:22:43,600
showed me pictures like that that's a

690
00:22:43,600 --> 00:22:44,880
rate one system

691
00:22:44,880 --> 00:22:47,200
um so it's basically mirroring data

692
00:22:47,200 --> 00:22:48,720
between two disks why

693
00:22:48,720 --> 00:22:50,880
well because they told me at the very

694
00:22:50,880 --> 00:22:52,880
beginning if you have a hard

695
00:22:52,880 --> 00:22:54,960
hard hardware resources they will fail

696
00:22:54,960 --> 00:22:55,919
at some

697
00:22:55,919 --> 00:22:57,919
day your disk will fail your network

698
00:22:57,919 --> 00:22:59,440
card your switch whatever

699
00:22:59,440 --> 00:23:01,120
it will fail and you need to have like a

700
00:23:01,120 --> 00:23:03,039
failover right and then you need to do

701
00:23:03,039 --> 00:23:04,480
backups because it's like

702
00:23:04,480 --> 00:23:06,240
for the data it's business data it might

703
00:23:06,240 --> 00:23:07,840
be your family pictures you need to make

704
00:23:07,840 --> 00:23:08,880
sure that you

705
00:23:08,880 --> 00:23:11,360
be prepared that things are failing

706
00:23:11,360 --> 00:23:13,200
hardware resources will failing

707
00:23:13,200 --> 00:23:15,200
it will fail and they told me all kind

708
00:23:15,200 --> 00:23:17,520
of methods how to deal with that right

709
00:23:17,520 --> 00:23:20,720
that's what i what i've been told in

710
00:23:20,720 --> 00:23:23,039
in my studies what no one taught me in

711
00:23:23,039 --> 00:23:25,200
my studies is how do i deal with my very

712
00:23:25,200 --> 00:23:26,159
own failures

713
00:23:26,159 --> 00:23:28,080
like wrong decisions that i make actions

714
00:23:28,080 --> 00:23:30,080
that i do or how do i deal with

715
00:23:30,080 --> 00:23:32,559
the actions or the decisions that that

716
00:23:32,559 --> 00:23:33,360
might have been

717
00:23:33,360 --> 00:23:35,840
not going well from from others so how

718
00:23:35,840 --> 00:23:37,280
do i deal with the with the with the

719
00:23:37,280 --> 00:23:38,720
failures of people

720
00:23:38,720 --> 00:23:42,080
most people think like um success is

721
00:23:42,080 --> 00:23:44,720
is is a result of avoiding failures

722
00:23:44,720 --> 00:23:45,200
right

723
00:23:45,200 --> 00:23:47,360
it's like that it's often what project

724
00:23:47,360 --> 00:23:49,120
management tries to tell us right we are

725
00:23:49,120 --> 00:23:50,159
here we want to go

726
00:23:50,159 --> 00:23:52,400
there there's a straight line and we

727
00:23:52,400 --> 00:23:54,400
already crossed out all the possible

728
00:23:54,400 --> 00:23:56,080
traps and failures along the way you

729
00:23:56,080 --> 00:23:57,840
just need to go the straight line

730
00:23:57,840 --> 00:24:00,480
um as they could predict predict the

731
00:24:00,480 --> 00:24:01,679
future

732
00:24:01,679 --> 00:24:04,960
but that's not how success works

733
00:24:04,960 --> 00:24:07,600
at least not in complex in complex

734
00:24:07,600 --> 00:24:08,640
systems right

735
00:24:08,640 --> 00:24:11,039
in complex systems you don't know the

736
00:24:11,039 --> 00:24:12,799
solution already right you just

737
00:24:12,799 --> 00:24:15,039
might have a direction way to go but you

738
00:24:15,039 --> 00:24:16,880
don't have the solution so what you do

739
00:24:16,880 --> 00:24:19,279
is like this iterative approach of like

740
00:24:19,279 --> 00:24:22,480
um tiptoeing forward like okay is that

741
00:24:22,480 --> 00:24:24,320
right and then get the feedback okay we

742
00:24:24,320 --> 00:24:25,919
are in the right direction we go

743
00:24:25,919 --> 00:24:27,919
further in that direction on is that

744
00:24:27,919 --> 00:24:29,679
right oh no okay so we need to

745
00:24:29,679 --> 00:24:31,279
switch a little bit and then basically

746
00:24:31,279 --> 00:24:33,520
what you do is like you you stumble from

747
00:24:33,520 --> 00:24:36,159
from one failure to the other um at and

748
00:24:36,159 --> 00:24:37,520
then at the later point in time you

749
00:24:37,520 --> 00:24:38,640
reach something that you would call

750
00:24:38,640 --> 00:24:40,320
success right this is also important

751
00:24:40,320 --> 00:24:42,400
success and failures are always things

752
00:24:42,400 --> 00:24:45,520
that we judge by looking back past back

753
00:24:45,520 --> 00:24:46,000
in time

754
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:47,919
and saying that was a good decision or

755
00:24:47,919 --> 00:24:49,520
that was a bad decision so

756
00:24:49,520 --> 00:24:52,799
we can't know up front and this is i

757
00:24:52,799 --> 00:24:53,600
started to talk

758
00:24:53,600 --> 00:24:55,760
saying i was wondering why why do we

759
00:24:55,760 --> 00:24:57,200
have high performing teams and other

760
00:24:57,200 --> 00:24:59,200
teams that are doing like okay

761
00:24:59,200 --> 00:25:02,000
and that's why why i triggered my

762
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:03,039
interest in

763
00:25:03,039 --> 00:25:06,240
doing some research in in trust

764
00:25:06,240 --> 00:25:08,159
google did the same just with a bit more

765
00:25:08,159 --> 00:25:11,679
resources so they hired all kind of

766
00:25:11,679 --> 00:25:13,279
scientists to find out why do they have

767
00:25:13,279 --> 00:25:14,559
teams that are high performing and

768
00:25:14,559 --> 00:25:15,679
others that just do

769
00:25:15,679 --> 00:25:18,559
like well okay um that that's broken in

770
00:25:18,559 --> 00:25:20,559
a project called aristotles

771
00:25:20,559 --> 00:25:24,000
um and that was already 2012

772
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:26,799
and what this what they found out is

773
00:25:26,799 --> 00:25:28,000
that something that they called

774
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:30,480
psychological safety was the most

775
00:25:30,480 --> 00:25:33,279
critical parameter to successful teams

776
00:25:33,279 --> 00:25:35,760
what they mean is that that feeling of

777
00:25:35,760 --> 00:25:37,600
trust that feeling of safety

778
00:25:37,600 --> 00:25:41,120
within a group or within an organization

779
00:25:41,120 --> 00:25:43,600
and in order how to foster that they

780
00:25:43,600 --> 00:25:44,559
came up with

781
00:25:44,559 --> 00:25:47,440
well um you can foster that feeling by

782
00:25:47,440 --> 00:25:48,880
by sharing weaknesses

783
00:25:48,880 --> 00:25:51,679
and personal vulnerabilities um to gain

784
00:25:51,679 --> 00:25:53,200
psychological safety

785
00:25:53,200 --> 00:25:55,760
um so showing empathy especially to

786
00:25:55,760 --> 00:25:56,960
leaders

787
00:25:56,960 --> 00:25:58,400
saying things like hey i don't know we

788
00:25:58,400 --> 00:26:00,159
need to decide this together can you

789
00:26:00,159 --> 00:26:01,039
help me here

790
00:26:01,039 --> 00:26:02,880
i have a problem i'm really like i'm

791
00:26:02,880 --> 00:26:05,360
scared i don't know how to do that

792
00:26:05,360 --> 00:26:07,600
i'm having a bad day such things that

793
00:26:07,600 --> 00:26:09,440
that show vulnerabilities

794
00:26:09,440 --> 00:26:12,559
that open up the room for for creating

795
00:26:12,559 --> 00:26:14,000
trust or as they say

796
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:17,039
psychological safety so

797
00:26:17,039 --> 00:26:19,760
um i already come to my to my wrap up

798
00:26:19,760 --> 00:26:21,520
slides so think about team sizes and

799
00:26:21,520 --> 00:26:23,200
communications when you want to foster

800
00:26:23,200 --> 00:26:25,039
trust like how big is the team how with

801
00:26:25,039 --> 00:26:26,159
how many people do you have to

802
00:26:26,159 --> 00:26:27,520
communicate or do you have to have a

803
00:26:27,520 --> 00:26:28,240
stable

804
00:26:28,240 --> 00:26:30,960
social uh trustful relationship think

805
00:26:30,960 --> 00:26:32,000
about diversity

806
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:34,240
everyone needs to be the person that

807
00:26:34,240 --> 00:26:36,000
they are that they can bring their best

808
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:37,120
to the table

809
00:26:37,120 --> 00:26:39,760
um and think about psychological safety

810
00:26:39,760 --> 00:26:40,159
talk

811
00:26:40,159 --> 00:26:42,720
think about um failure culture positive

812
00:26:42,720 --> 00:26:43,840
failure culture

813
00:26:43,840 --> 00:26:46,320
um think about what what google research

814
00:26:46,320 --> 00:26:48,559
um showed up with psychological safety

815
00:26:48,559 --> 00:26:50,000
that you can build up with showing

816
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:51,919
vulnerabilities showing that you're not

817
00:26:51,919 --> 00:26:53,679
all knowing that

818
00:26:53,679 --> 00:26:56,960
you need help also by others and with

819
00:26:56,960 --> 00:26:57,360
that

820
00:26:57,360 --> 00:27:00,640
i hope i i made it somehow in

821
00:27:00,640 --> 00:27:04,240
time mike did i did i

822
00:27:04,240 --> 00:27:07,360
yes did i succeed yeah you succeeded

823
00:27:07,360 --> 00:27:10,480
okay definitely succeeded so

824
00:27:10,480 --> 00:27:13,760
let me let me check the

825
00:27:13,760 --> 00:27:17,919
cues to see who if we have any questions

826
00:27:17,919 --> 00:27:19,679
queued up here i don't see

827
00:27:19,679 --> 00:27:24,320
anything right now although we have

828
00:27:24,320 --> 00:27:28,080
we have approximately 128 people

829
00:27:28,080 --> 00:27:28,799
watching

830
00:27:28,799 --> 00:27:33,200
so i'm not sure where the questions are

831
00:27:33,200 --> 00:27:36,399
for but

832
00:27:36,399 --> 00:27:40,320
let's give it a few minutes here and uh

833
00:27:40,320 --> 00:27:43,200
we'll see before because we're after you

834
00:27:43,200 --> 00:27:44,640
we're just going on a break

835
00:27:44,640 --> 00:27:48,640
so um i'm just waiting to see if

836
00:27:48,640 --> 00:27:52,720
i already alerted in the in the track

837
00:27:52,720 --> 00:27:56,080
devsecops uh in slack to

838
00:27:56,080 --> 00:27:58,799
to post questions so i'm just waiting to

839
00:27:58,799 --> 00:27:59,520
see if

840
00:27:59,520 --> 00:28:05,360
we get anything listed there

841
00:28:06,399 --> 00:28:09,120
let me see

842
00:28:12,880 --> 00:28:15,440
uh we got a question here that says how

843
00:28:15,440 --> 00:28:16,720
would you advise

844
00:28:16,720 --> 00:28:20,320
trust for startups

845
00:28:20,799 --> 00:28:24,640
oh that's a good one um i think it with

846
00:28:24,640 --> 00:28:26,720
startups it should be actually easily

847
00:28:26,720 --> 00:28:29,120
easier than in in large multinational

848
00:28:29,120 --> 00:28:30,320
companies that

849
00:28:30,320 --> 00:28:33,039
that's simply the size and that's what

850
00:28:33,039 --> 00:28:34,799
where is whatever i spoke about

851
00:28:34,799 --> 00:28:36,880
look into the team size i mean having a

852
00:28:36,880 --> 00:28:38,559
hundred thousand employees

853
00:28:38,559 --> 00:28:40,799
like like my company you couldn't have a

854
00:28:40,799 --> 00:28:42,399
stable trustful relationship with

855
00:28:42,399 --> 00:28:44,080
everyone because it's just you can't

856
00:28:44,080 --> 00:28:44,720
even met

857
00:28:44,720 --> 00:28:47,200
everyone um because it's just too huge

858
00:28:47,200 --> 00:28:48,960
so you have to to find out like

859
00:28:48,960 --> 00:28:51,120
with whom do i need a trustful stable

860
00:28:51,120 --> 00:28:52,159
relationships and

861
00:28:52,159 --> 00:28:54,799
honestly i thought but maybe that the

862
00:28:54,799 --> 00:28:56,240
person who raised the question

863
00:28:56,240 --> 00:28:57,760
could could prove me wrong i thought

864
00:28:57,760 --> 00:28:59,520
that it's much easier for

865
00:28:59,520 --> 00:29:02,399
for startups that in most cases start

866
00:29:02,399 --> 00:29:02,960
small

867
00:29:02,960 --> 00:29:05,039
and then should have distrustful

868
00:29:05,039 --> 00:29:06,880
relationships at least at the first

869
00:29:06,880 --> 00:29:09,039
entrepreneurs and then the first people

870
00:29:09,039 --> 00:29:10,559
joining but i think

871
00:29:10,559 --> 00:29:13,120
um at least that's how i get that

872
00:29:13,120 --> 00:29:15,679
question already a few times is like

873
00:29:15,679 --> 00:29:18,080
when when these startups are successful

874
00:29:18,080 --> 00:29:20,320
then they they grew very very fast like

875
00:29:20,320 --> 00:29:21,279
exponentially

876
00:29:21,279 --> 00:29:23,039
and then they add up a lot of people and

877
00:29:23,039 --> 00:29:25,039
then the the things comes up

878
00:29:25,039 --> 00:29:27,120
come comes up with the trust because

879
00:29:27,120 --> 00:29:28,960
things go so fast that

880
00:29:28,960 --> 00:29:32,240
people um do not take um

881
00:29:32,240 --> 00:29:34,470
enough um

882
00:29:34,470 --> 00:29:35,840
[Music]

883
00:29:35,840 --> 00:29:38,000
attention to do not pay enough attention

884
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:39,039
on okay

885
00:29:39,039 --> 00:29:41,120
we need to think about how do we

886
00:29:41,120 --> 00:29:42,320
structure the whole

887
00:29:42,320 --> 00:29:44,880
um organizational setups like who who do

888
00:29:44,880 --> 00:29:45,760
we how do we

889
00:29:45,760 --> 00:29:47,679
make sure that the people with the same

890
00:29:47,679 --> 00:29:49,840
interests come can communicate and and

891
00:29:49,840 --> 00:29:50,799
be connected

892
00:29:50,799 --> 00:29:52,799
um in the in the right manner i think

893
00:29:52,799 --> 00:29:54,320
this is the challenge for

894
00:29:54,320 --> 00:29:56,720
for the most startups as long as they

895
00:29:56,720 --> 00:29:57,919
are small i think it

896
00:29:57,919 --> 00:29:59,919
naturally more or less works out but

897
00:29:59,919 --> 00:30:01,760
then if you go like in this

898
00:30:01,760 --> 00:30:05,440
um hopefully um exponential growth

899
00:30:05,440 --> 00:30:07,840
this thing takes off this is i think

900
00:30:07,840 --> 00:30:09,600
where where some

901
00:30:09,600 --> 00:30:11,679
startups stumble and i think here you

902
00:30:11,679 --> 00:30:14,240
really like um even though i know

903
00:30:14,240 --> 00:30:17,039
as an engineer and talking about trust

904
00:30:17,039 --> 00:30:17,520
is

905
00:30:17,520 --> 00:30:19,840
like this is a fluffy thing and you know

906
00:30:19,840 --> 00:30:22,880
we don't know and then um yeah but

907
00:30:22,880 --> 00:30:24,960
it doesn't help at the end you have to

908
00:30:24,960 --> 00:30:26,960
take that one step back and say okay hey

909
00:30:26,960 --> 00:30:28,720
we really have to scratch our head like

910
00:30:28,720 --> 00:30:30,559
how do we do this how do we align good

911
00:30:30,559 --> 00:30:32,080
communication structures and an

912
00:30:32,080 --> 00:30:33,360
organizational setup that

913
00:30:33,360 --> 00:30:35,679
can ensure this i know this at the very

914
00:30:35,679 --> 00:30:37,360
beginning feels odd especially when you

915
00:30:37,360 --> 00:30:39,279
come up with this to your manager or

916
00:30:39,279 --> 00:30:41,440
boss and saying hey we need to do that

917
00:30:41,440 --> 00:30:44,320
um but i think you have to right so let

918
00:30:44,320 --> 00:30:45,760
me let me ask you this

919
00:30:45,760 --> 00:30:49,360
as as uh it

920
00:30:49,360 --> 00:30:51,279
kind of to elaborate a little bit more

921
00:30:51,279 --> 00:30:52,799
on that last question

922
00:30:52,799 --> 00:30:56,159
um as

923
00:30:56,159 --> 00:30:59,760
as uh processes and devops has

924
00:30:59,760 --> 00:31:03,279
uh grown over the years um would that

925
00:31:03,279 --> 00:31:04,720
change your opinion

926
00:31:04,720 --> 00:31:08,240
on how you know that trust would would

927
00:31:08,240 --> 00:31:10,399
go for startups i mean because

928
00:31:10,399 --> 00:31:13,120
things have evolved new tools new

929
00:31:13,120 --> 00:31:14,320
processes

930
00:31:14,320 --> 00:31:17,679
i mean people have tried to improve

931
00:31:17,679 --> 00:31:20,000
you know how would you explain that over

932
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:22,320
the years

933
00:31:22,320 --> 00:31:25,279
i i think at least from from the time

934
00:31:25,279 --> 00:31:25,840
that i'm

935
00:31:25,840 --> 00:31:28,399
somehow involved in the devops community

936
00:31:28,399 --> 00:31:29,039
like

937
00:31:29,039 --> 00:31:31,440
four or five years back i think we

938
00:31:31,440 --> 00:31:32,880
talked a lot at the beginning we talked

939
00:31:32,880 --> 00:31:34,080
a lot about tools

940
00:31:34,080 --> 00:31:36,159
and processes and configuration

941
00:31:36,159 --> 00:31:37,919
management tools and then containers and

942
00:31:37,919 --> 00:31:38,799
security and

943
00:31:38,799 --> 00:31:41,279
and such things and i think um over the

944
00:31:41,279 --> 00:31:42,159
time we we

945
00:31:42,159 --> 00:31:45,679
we've spoken more and more about the the

946
00:31:45,679 --> 00:31:48,960
um things like like trust and how we

947
00:31:48,960 --> 00:31:51,360
how we could build great teams so i

948
00:31:51,360 --> 00:31:52,399
think um

949
00:31:52,399 --> 00:31:55,919
it has become aware of um

950
00:31:55,919 --> 00:31:58,399
yeah now we have reached a state with

951
00:31:58,399 --> 00:32:00,720
our tooling and our automation

952
00:32:00,720 --> 00:32:03,840
that is like as i said we can do these

953
00:32:03,840 --> 00:32:06,399
um these one-line code changes into

954
00:32:06,399 --> 00:32:08,080
production within minutes or even

955
00:32:08,080 --> 00:32:09,440
seconds what have you

956
00:32:09,440 --> 00:32:12,720
but um there is something that we still

957
00:32:12,720 --> 00:32:14,720
don't do it why is that and this is

958
00:32:14,720 --> 00:32:16,720
again we yeah we need to talk about

959
00:32:16,720 --> 00:32:18,399
these these things that

960
00:32:18,399 --> 00:32:21,840
um uh basically we all know them we are

961
00:32:21,840 --> 00:32:23,279
all humans but it's

962
00:32:23,279 --> 00:32:25,440
and we are intelligent people but then

963
00:32:25,440 --> 00:32:26,480
it felt

964
00:32:26,480 --> 00:32:28,480
so hard to address them with your

965
00:32:28,480 --> 00:32:30,240
co-workers with your boss

966
00:32:30,240 --> 00:32:32,559
to to talk about these things so i think

967
00:32:32,559 --> 00:32:34,159
these things have become in the last

968
00:32:34,159 --> 00:32:36,159
years more and more prominent and more

969
00:32:36,159 --> 00:32:37,200
and more

970
00:32:37,200 --> 00:32:38,559
important and more and more people

971
00:32:38,559 --> 00:32:40,480
realize yeah without

972
00:32:40,480 --> 00:32:43,360
looking into that we don't have it and

973
00:32:43,360 --> 00:32:44,000
you know

974
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:46,320
applying tools is the manageable part of

975
00:32:46,320 --> 00:32:48,559
of devops and automation and this is

976
00:32:48,559 --> 00:32:50,080
like the manageable part

977
00:32:50,080 --> 00:32:52,399
but the hard nut to crack is like this

978
00:32:52,399 --> 00:32:54,640
cultural part and i don't have you know

979
00:32:54,640 --> 00:32:57,679
the perfect plan how to to to to do to

980
00:32:57,679 --> 00:32:59,360
to do it or how to go there

981
00:32:59,360 --> 00:33:01,279
but at the end sooner or later you will

982
00:33:01,279 --> 00:33:03,039
end up with like yeah we have to

983
00:33:03,039 --> 00:33:04,559
we have to look into that even though

984
00:33:04,559 --> 00:33:06,399
it's the not manageable part no one can

985
00:33:06,399 --> 00:33:08,240
guarantee if you succeed with that

986
00:33:08,240 --> 00:33:10,640
because you know every company every

987
00:33:10,640 --> 00:33:12,240
team every organization then is

988
00:33:12,240 --> 00:33:13,919
is different again and you can look into

989
00:33:13,919 --> 00:33:15,840
what others do and you should do that

990
00:33:15,840 --> 00:33:18,399
but at the end you have you find your

991
00:33:18,399 --> 00:33:19,440
way in your

992
00:33:19,440 --> 00:33:22,480
company culture that mets your

993
00:33:22,480 --> 00:33:25,840
yeah you're people basically right right

994
00:33:25,840 --> 00:33:28,240
yeah so here's here's another

995
00:33:28,240 --> 00:33:30,320
interesting question that came in

996
00:33:30,320 --> 00:33:33,519
he says i have a plaguing question but

997
00:33:33,519 --> 00:33:34,240
haven't

998
00:33:34,240 --> 00:33:37,519
joined a team yet what do you do

999
00:33:37,519 --> 00:33:40,720
if you have foundational uh

1000
00:33:40,720 --> 00:33:43,679
world view and you worry you'll you'll

1001
00:33:43,679 --> 00:33:44,399
clash

1002
00:33:44,399 --> 00:33:47,360
with your team based on your beliefs

1003
00:33:47,360 --> 00:33:47,919
even

1004
00:33:47,919 --> 00:33:52,320
if you've worked with uh

1005
00:33:52,320 --> 00:33:55,519
people who are opposite than you

1006
00:33:55,519 --> 00:33:58,960
in a closed setting like devops

1007
00:33:58,960 --> 00:34:02,399
yeah i i mean this

1008
00:34:02,399 --> 00:34:04,480
the question sounds like there isn't

1009
00:34:04,480 --> 00:34:06,480
there isn't much trust in place right

1010
00:34:06,480 --> 00:34:07,039
you know

1011
00:34:07,039 --> 00:34:09,520
not coming up with with this question to

1012
00:34:09,520 --> 00:34:10,800
the team or not like

1013
00:34:10,800 --> 00:34:12,960
coming up with that i uh with the ideas

1014
00:34:12,960 --> 00:34:14,320
that you have

1015
00:34:14,320 --> 00:34:17,359
um i think you can't i mean you

1016
00:34:17,359 --> 00:34:20,000
it is hard to change people's behaviors

1017
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:21,679
or team culture and then

1018
00:34:21,679 --> 00:34:23,440
first behaviors and then it becomes a

1019
00:34:23,440 --> 00:34:25,119
culture i think

1020
00:34:25,119 --> 00:34:27,359
you can do it only in like baby steps

1021
00:34:27,359 --> 00:34:28,320
you have to go

1022
00:34:28,320 --> 00:34:31,199
one by one and you don't come up with

1023
00:34:31,199 --> 00:34:32,000
like ah

1024
00:34:32,000 --> 00:34:34,719
i i've read this book how do google does

1025
00:34:34,719 --> 00:34:36,399
sre we just have to do it

1026
00:34:36,399 --> 00:34:39,119
everything the same and this in most

1027
00:34:39,119 --> 00:34:40,879
cases will just overload

1028
00:34:40,879 --> 00:34:43,040
people and then they go like into no

1029
00:34:43,040 --> 00:34:45,359
this is not what we need to do and we

1030
00:34:45,359 --> 00:34:48,320
we did it like decades that way and we

1031
00:34:48,320 --> 00:34:48,800
don't

1032
00:34:48,800 --> 00:34:50,879
want to move it all around and with that

1033
00:34:50,879 --> 00:34:53,280
you you're like hitting a hard wall i

1034
00:34:53,280 --> 00:34:54,399
think you need to

1035
00:34:54,399 --> 00:34:57,040
you need to slowly do baby steps and

1036
00:34:57,040 --> 00:34:57,440
then

1037
00:34:57,440 --> 00:34:59,119
like really celebrate everything that

1038
00:34:59,119 --> 00:35:01,040
you have reached along the way it's like

1039
00:35:01,040 --> 00:35:01,599
really

1040
00:35:01,599 --> 00:35:04,000
okay let's let's start what i always

1041
00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:06,000
like is starting making work visible

1042
00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:08,400
monitoring like technically monitoring

1043
00:35:08,400 --> 00:35:10,160
your system your production

1044
00:35:10,160 --> 00:35:12,400
systems and so on but also making your

1045
00:35:12,400 --> 00:35:14,240
work visible in regards to

1046
00:35:14,240 --> 00:35:15,760
kanban boards whatever what what are

1047
00:35:15,760 --> 00:35:17,680
people actually doing that is

1048
00:35:17,680 --> 00:35:19,920
like like already something that that

1049
00:35:19,920 --> 00:35:20,960
people can digest

1050
00:35:20,960 --> 00:35:23,040
right okay yeah let's do it um okay now

1051
00:35:23,040 --> 00:35:25,760
i'm putting pushing cards around okay

1052
00:35:25,760 --> 00:35:27,599
doing that and then you know showing

1053
00:35:27,599 --> 00:35:29,359
them hey this this has a benefit right

1054
00:35:29,359 --> 00:35:30,960
since then since we do this and that

1055
00:35:30,960 --> 00:35:32,640
since we monitor the system since we

1056
00:35:32,640 --> 00:35:33,920
monitor what people do

1057
00:35:33,920 --> 00:35:36,160
we don't have this argumentations or

1058
00:35:36,160 --> 00:35:37,760
discussions anymore we just

1059
00:35:37,760 --> 00:35:39,920
being a bit more productive and then you

1060
00:35:39,920 --> 00:35:41,760
know you notch them more and more into

1061
00:35:41,760 --> 00:35:43,520
the direction you want to have them

1062
00:35:43,520 --> 00:35:45,839
but but be aware that this will take

1063
00:35:45,839 --> 00:35:47,040
years depending on

1064
00:35:47,040 --> 00:35:49,200
you know what state you are in and what

1065
00:35:49,200 --> 00:35:50,480
state you want to reach

1066
00:35:50,480 --> 00:35:52,960
that this really can can take years that

1067
00:35:52,960 --> 00:35:54,880
is not nothing that you just you know

1068
00:35:54,880 --> 00:35:56,480
hear everyone read this book and by

1069
00:35:56,480 --> 00:35:58,079
tomorrow we will do ex

1070
00:35:58,079 --> 00:36:00,640
as in this book i've never seen that

1071
00:36:00,640 --> 00:36:02,880
working you so it's really

1072
00:36:02,880 --> 00:36:06,000
it is hard work um and it always goes in

1073
00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:08,640
baby step at least from my experience

1074
00:36:08,640 --> 00:36:12,640
can can this be worked i guess

1075
00:36:12,640 --> 00:36:16,560
this this trust level from the ground

1076
00:36:16,560 --> 00:36:19,760
up or from the top down oh that's

1077
00:36:19,760 --> 00:36:23,359
that's a very good question i think um

1078
00:36:23,359 --> 00:36:25,440
i have it in the basically in the same

1079
00:36:25,440 --> 00:36:27,440
slide deck but in the longer version of

1080
00:36:27,440 --> 00:36:29,440
that talk at the very end

1081
00:36:29,440 --> 00:36:32,560
um there is a there's a book um

1082
00:36:32,560 --> 00:36:34,640
reinventing organizations by frederick

1083
00:36:34,640 --> 00:36:36,560
la liu and i have a one slide deck where

1084
00:36:36,560 --> 00:36:38,720
i quote him where he says

1085
00:36:38,720 --> 00:36:42,880
um the um the organizational

1086
00:36:42,880 --> 00:36:46,079
um um how is that

1087
00:36:46,079 --> 00:36:49,200
an organization cannot evolve beyond its

1088
00:36:49,200 --> 00:36:51,359
leadership state of mind

1089
00:36:51,359 --> 00:36:54,240
so i think in most cases like devops

1090
00:36:54,240 --> 00:36:55,920
initiatives are driven from

1091
00:36:55,920 --> 00:36:59,040
um technology people from like bottom up

1092
00:36:59,040 --> 00:37:01,520
like yeah there's something we do mostly

1093
00:37:01,520 --> 00:37:02,960
because of starting with tools and we

1094
00:37:02,960 --> 00:37:04,400
should work a little bit different and

1095
00:37:04,400 --> 00:37:05,599
how we do that

1096
00:37:05,599 --> 00:37:09,359
but if the leadership is not on that

1097
00:37:09,359 --> 00:37:11,760
state of mind that they can understand

1098
00:37:11,760 --> 00:37:13,280
like what problems are you trying to

1099
00:37:13,280 --> 00:37:14,079
solve

1100
00:37:14,079 --> 00:37:16,800
then i think you will hit a roof here so

1101
00:37:16,800 --> 00:37:17,200
i

1102
00:37:17,200 --> 00:37:19,440
think at least from the companies that i

1103
00:37:19,440 --> 00:37:20,720
know that

1104
00:37:20,720 --> 00:37:24,000
i would consider having a good devops

1105
00:37:24,000 --> 00:37:25,440
journey transformation whatever you want

1106
00:37:25,440 --> 00:37:27,280
to call that it was

1107
00:37:27,280 --> 00:37:29,520
always like coming from top down and

1108
00:37:29,520 --> 00:37:31,680
bottom up most likely it started bottom

1109
00:37:31,680 --> 00:37:32,000
up

1110
00:37:32,000 --> 00:37:34,480
but sooner or later top management

1111
00:37:34,480 --> 00:37:35,200
leadership

1112
00:37:35,200 --> 00:37:37,760
get you know got the notice and then it

1113
00:37:37,760 --> 00:37:38,320
was all

1114
00:37:38,320 --> 00:37:40,240
also coming from there and so you have

1115
00:37:40,240 --> 00:37:41,520
these two um

1116
00:37:41,520 --> 00:37:44,480
you have these two approaches um only

1117
00:37:44,480 --> 00:37:45,760
working bottom up

1118
00:37:45,760 --> 00:37:47,760
i think you will you will hit the roof

1119
00:37:47,760 --> 00:37:48,800
um

1120
00:37:48,800 --> 00:37:50,480
as la lu says and then if your

1121
00:37:50,480 --> 00:37:53,119
leadership state of mind is not

1122
00:37:53,119 --> 00:37:55,760
ready for this put it that way um as

1123
00:37:55,760 --> 00:37:56,160
then

1124
00:37:56,160 --> 00:37:59,599
at least i haven't seen it um um

1125
00:37:59,599 --> 00:38:02,640
like working out yeah that's a very good

1126
00:38:02,640 --> 00:38:03,599
point

1127
00:38:03,599 --> 00:38:06,720
well dirk thank you very much for taking
