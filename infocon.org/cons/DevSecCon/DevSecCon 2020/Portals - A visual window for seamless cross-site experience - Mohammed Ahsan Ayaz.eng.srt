is yours go ahead yes sir thank you so

9
00:00:20,189 --> 00:00:21,689
much for the opportunity to talk here

10
00:00:21,689 --> 00:00:23,760
and I'm pretty excited to share what I

11
00:00:23,760 --> 00:00:26,279
know about the community so here

12
00:00:26,279 --> 00:00:28,260
everyone I'm Mohammad Ahsan ayahs and

13
00:00:28,260 --> 00:00:30,359
I'm a senior software engineer at

14
00:00:30,359 --> 00:00:33,300
Cornell I am also a Google developers

15
00:00:33,300 --> 00:00:36,660
expert in web and angular and today I'm

16
00:00:36,660 --> 00:00:38,190
going to be talking about poodels

17
00:00:38,190 --> 00:00:41,190
which is kind of a new API recently

18
00:00:41,190 --> 00:00:43,469
shared by chrome team and it's very

19
00:00:43,469 --> 00:00:45,600
promising when it comes to how we

20
00:00:45,600 --> 00:00:48,899
percept user experience on the web so

21
00:00:48,899 --> 00:00:54,420
let's jump into it right now so first of

22
00:00:54,420 --> 00:00:57,690
all I think we can all acknowledge that

23
00:00:57,690 --> 00:01:00,870
we really love web apps we love building

24
00:01:00,870 --> 00:01:01,620
web apps

25
00:01:01,620 --> 00:01:03,329
we love the tools that we used to build

26
00:01:03,329 --> 00:01:07,010
it and we love our ideas and whatnot so

27
00:01:07,010 --> 00:01:10,110
if you talk about deadlines when

28
00:01:10,110 --> 00:01:11,760
building web apps how do you feel about

29
00:01:11,760 --> 00:01:15,150
that so for instance you have some

30
00:01:15,150 --> 00:01:16,860
feature in progress that you are working

31
00:01:16,860 --> 00:01:18,840
on day and night and you're pretty

32
00:01:18,840 --> 00:01:21,090
comfortable with that and it probably

33
00:01:21,090 --> 00:01:24,090
looks like this at this point and then

34
00:01:24,090 --> 00:01:26,670
the client says that you have to finish

35
00:01:26,670 --> 00:01:29,040
it like in 24 hours and you have spent

36
00:01:29,040 --> 00:01:31,860
like a week or so so what do you do in

37
00:01:31,860 --> 00:01:32,579
that case

38
00:01:32,579 --> 00:01:35,670
probably you finish it by something like

39
00:01:35,670 --> 00:01:39,900
this so instead of deadlines let's talk

40
00:01:39,900 --> 00:01:42,000
about the modern web and I think this is

41
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:44,430
a question that we have been asking

42
00:01:44,430 --> 00:01:47,189
ourselves for quite long and you know

43
00:01:47,189 --> 00:01:48,960
what the API is would look like how we

44
00:01:48,960 --> 00:01:51,329
would browse and if we look at the

45
00:01:51,329 --> 00:01:53,579
current state of the web right now and

46
00:01:53,579 --> 00:01:55,259
if you talk about how it works on mobile

47
00:01:55,259 --> 00:01:57,299
for instance you have a mobile app or a

48
00:01:57,299 --> 00:01:59,100
web app that you're running on mobile

49
00:01:59,100 --> 00:02:02,850
you perhaps click a link and then what

50
00:02:02,850 --> 00:02:06,149
you do is that you wait and then you

51
00:02:06,149 --> 00:02:09,270
wait more and then you are still waiting

52
00:02:09,270 --> 00:02:12,390
and and this is specifically if you are

53
00:02:12,390 --> 00:02:13,890
on a low

54
00:02:13,890 --> 00:02:15,780
and network condition for instance allo

55
00:02:15,780 --> 00:02:18,600
to G and for instance if I'm opening

56
00:02:18,600 --> 00:02:22,440
LinkedIn or any website it would start

57
00:02:22,440 --> 00:02:25,980
rendering but then finally it becomes

58
00:02:25,980 --> 00:02:28,200
interactive so it takes quite a while to

59
00:02:28,200 --> 00:02:30,600
be interactive for the user to jump in

60
00:02:30,600 --> 00:02:32,760
and by the time the user is just like

61
00:02:32,760 --> 00:02:34,890
man I don't know what's happening so

62
00:02:34,890 --> 00:02:39,210
let's talk about if we can improve this

63
00:02:39,210 --> 00:02:41,340
this whole scenario and if we can make

64
00:02:41,340 --> 00:02:43,440
the web better for instance if we talk

65
00:02:43,440 --> 00:02:46,260
about Android it's very fluent and

66
00:02:46,260 --> 00:02:48,570
there's something called scenes in

67
00:02:48,570 --> 00:02:50,640
Android and you can see that we click

68
00:02:50,640 --> 00:02:52,860
this clock or we tap on it and it

69
00:02:52,860 --> 00:02:55,860
becomes the new page for us and it's

70
00:02:55,860 --> 00:02:58,410
really seamless how it transitions from

71
00:02:58,410 --> 00:03:02,460
one page to another but the question is

72
00:03:02,460 --> 00:03:05,300
how do we do this on the web

73
00:03:05,300 --> 00:03:08,850
now there's something that chrome

74
00:03:08,850 --> 00:03:10,530
introduced and that's what we are

75
00:03:10,530 --> 00:03:14,010
talking about it's called portals and if

76
00:03:14,010 --> 00:03:16,680
you talk about portals how do we

77
00:03:16,680 --> 00:03:20,400
basically use that so portals are right

78
00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:23,880
now behind a flag in chrome and Chrome

79
00:03:23,880 --> 00:03:26,250
Canary and you can easily enable that

80
00:03:26,250 --> 00:03:27,720
and I'm gonna show you how you do that

81
00:03:27,720 --> 00:03:32,730
but if any browser doesn't support let's

82
00:03:32,730 --> 00:03:35,610
say portals you can quickly check it by

83
00:03:35,610 --> 00:03:37,770
this you can see if we have assumed a

84
00:03:37,770 --> 00:03:40,110
portal element in window and you could

85
00:03:40,110 --> 00:03:41,820
be using some other browser that doesn't

86
00:03:41,820 --> 00:03:45,000
support it or you can be using a prior

87
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:46,830
chrome version or maybe you don't have

88
00:03:46,830 --> 00:03:48,900
the flags enable so whatever the reason

89
00:03:48,900 --> 00:03:50,250
is you can quickly check if the browser

90
00:03:50,250 --> 00:03:53,010
is compatible and if you want to create

91
00:03:53,010 --> 00:03:56,100
portals there are quite a few ways so

92
00:03:56,100 --> 00:03:59,220
for instance for instance you can use

93
00:03:59,220 --> 00:04:01,260
the HTML portal element it's very easy

94
00:04:01,260 --> 00:04:03,150
you can see that it looks something like

95
00:04:03,150 --> 00:04:05,910
an iframe you use the portal element you

96
00:04:05,910 --> 00:04:07,920
provided a source and boom you're done

97
00:04:07,920 --> 00:04:09,930
if you want to create it using

98
00:04:09,930 --> 00:04:12,269
javascript this is how it would look you

99
00:04:12,269 --> 00:04:14,070
can create it by document or create

100
00:04:14,070 --> 00:04:16,140
element portal and then you can provide

101
00:04:16,140 --> 00:04:17,970
it a source you can provide it some

102
00:04:17,970 --> 00:04:21,120
styles also and then finally you append

103
00:04:21,120 --> 00:04:23,370
a child or this portal that you created

104
00:04:23,370 --> 00:04:26,650
on body and I'm showing this really good

105
00:04:26,650 --> 00:04:29,740
I'm gonna show later as well this small

106
00:04:29,740 --> 00:04:32,080
box is basically a portal and once

107
00:04:32,080 --> 00:04:34,270
you're ready to do the transition

108
00:04:34,270 --> 00:04:38,949
because poodle is used to to be used in

109
00:04:38,949 --> 00:04:40,900
different transition from one page to

110
00:04:40,900 --> 00:04:42,250
another it could be a single page

111
00:04:42,250 --> 00:04:44,290
application it could be a multi page

112
00:04:44,290 --> 00:04:46,300
application or in fact it could be

113
00:04:46,300 --> 00:04:48,610
multiple domains that are being switched

114
00:04:48,610 --> 00:04:51,010
for instance you are going from ABC com

115
00:04:51,010 --> 00:04:54,400
to de F dot o-r-g so when you're ready

116
00:04:54,400 --> 00:04:57,010
to do the transition you can use portal

117
00:04:57,010 --> 00:05:00,100
dot accurate and if you are using portal

118
00:05:00,100 --> 00:05:02,680
and if you are inspecting it you will be

119
00:05:02,680 --> 00:05:04,479
able to see that you get this portal

120
00:05:04,479 --> 00:05:06,520
HTML element it has all the properties

121
00:05:06,520 --> 00:05:08,830
you can see below that I have put some

122
00:05:08,830 --> 00:05:11,020
Styles on that so you can actually style

123
00:05:11,020 --> 00:05:13,330
how it looks where it will be positioned

124
00:05:13,330 --> 00:05:15,340
and what would happen when we actually

125
00:05:15,340 --> 00:05:18,070
activate so to activate a portal you use

126
00:05:18,070 --> 00:05:20,229
the portal dot activate method and then

127
00:05:20,229 --> 00:05:23,169
it becomes the top-level view so the

128
00:05:23,169 --> 00:05:26,169
difference between an iframe and a

129
00:05:26,169 --> 00:05:28,570
portal is that you basically have the

130
00:05:28,570 --> 00:05:30,310
iframe on your page but you can not

131
00:05:30,310 --> 00:05:32,500
actually navigate into it or make it the

132
00:05:32,500 --> 00:05:34,570
top-level page but with portals you

133
00:05:34,570 --> 00:05:36,250
actually can do that when you do put us

134
00:05:36,250 --> 00:05:39,310
to activate it becomes the new page so

135
00:05:39,310 --> 00:05:41,320
you do put elective 8 and then it

136
00:05:41,320 --> 00:05:45,490
becomes then your page for it but the

137
00:05:45,490 --> 00:05:47,470
question is what you've seen so far is

138
00:05:47,470 --> 00:05:49,840
this a really good experience we had a

139
00:05:49,840 --> 00:05:52,960
box being shown in a page we click it

140
00:05:52,960 --> 00:05:55,240
becomes the new page but where is the

141
00:05:55,240 --> 00:05:57,820
seamlessness in this because for the

142
00:05:57,820 --> 00:06:00,010
user it is still looks like a broken

143
00:06:00,010 --> 00:06:02,919
experience or I won't say broken but

144
00:06:02,919 --> 00:06:05,740
maybe a discrete experience so when we

145
00:06:05,740 --> 00:06:08,080
talk about seamlessness we probably

146
00:06:08,080 --> 00:06:11,110
imagine animations and portal actually

147
00:06:11,110 --> 00:06:13,300
has nothing to do with the animations so

148
00:06:13,300 --> 00:06:15,490
for animations there's something called

149
00:06:15,490 --> 00:06:18,849
BYO a or build your own animations and

150
00:06:18,849 --> 00:06:21,070
you can decide how the portal would look

151
00:06:21,070 --> 00:06:24,580
and what would happen when you are now

152
00:06:24,580 --> 00:06:26,680
you're ready to go into the portal or

153
00:06:26,680 --> 00:06:28,650
navigate to the new page how would the

154
00:06:28,650 --> 00:06:33,130
transition look like so the question is

155
00:06:33,130 --> 00:06:35,110
how do we make it smooth it's still

156
00:06:35,110 --> 00:06:38,260
discrete so what you can do is with this

157
00:06:38,260 --> 00:06:40,020
example that I showed you

158
00:06:40,020 --> 00:06:42,300
the box and then you start animating it

159
00:06:42,300 --> 00:06:44,940
so for instance it will expand a bit and

160
00:06:44,940 --> 00:06:47,789
then it will take the whole screen for

161
00:06:47,789 --> 00:06:50,069
you and then it will become the new page

162
00:06:50,069 --> 00:06:52,770
now if you notice in the images the

163
00:06:52,770 --> 00:06:55,440
first three images have the URL SNI

164
00:06:55,440 --> 00:07:00,030
ascom slash 404 but this one has s and

165
00:07:00,030 --> 00:07:02,310
is calm so it's a different URL so now

166
00:07:02,310 --> 00:07:04,379
we switch from one page to another

167
00:07:04,379 --> 00:07:07,259
within the same domain but it is not

168
00:07:07,259 --> 00:07:09,270
necessarily a single page application

169
00:07:09,270 --> 00:07:11,849
this could be multiple HTML pages but

170
00:07:11,849 --> 00:07:13,259
you can see that it is a seamless

171
00:07:13,259 --> 00:07:15,780
transition from one page to another by

172
00:07:15,780 --> 00:07:19,229
showing this really neat animation now

173
00:07:19,229 --> 00:07:22,139
now one thing that I always talk about

174
00:07:22,139 --> 00:07:24,449
when discussing portal is that you

175
00:07:24,449 --> 00:07:26,909
animate first and then you activate so

176
00:07:26,909 --> 00:07:29,250
this box will first animate and how it

177
00:07:29,250 --> 00:07:31,949
would admit is based on you so you will

178
00:07:31,949 --> 00:07:34,409
put the the kind of logic in your first

179
00:07:34,409 --> 00:07:37,889
page that if this portal is Clint then

180
00:07:37,889 --> 00:07:40,020
you do some fancy animation and it could

181
00:07:40,020 --> 00:07:41,310
look something like this this is what

182
00:07:41,310 --> 00:07:44,069
I've put in my example so this will this

183
00:07:44,069 --> 00:07:46,740
will first animate and you can see that

184
00:07:46,740 --> 00:07:48,960
I'm providing the style width 100% a

185
00:07:48,960 --> 00:07:51,000
solid style hide hundred-percent

186
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:54,180
also the transition is using some some

187
00:07:54,180 --> 00:07:58,110
passing animations as well now once you

188
00:07:58,110 --> 00:08:00,479
have animated it you can then activate

189
00:08:00,479 --> 00:08:03,900
it so the way I've done it and you can

190
00:08:03,900 --> 00:08:06,479
do it with your own logics or your own

191
00:08:06,479 --> 00:08:08,370
methods but what I've done is that I

192
00:08:08,370 --> 00:08:10,919
actually see the transition end method

193
00:08:10,919 --> 00:08:13,620
on the poodle that I created so I see if

194
00:08:13,620 --> 00:08:16,500
I have transitioned or if I have kind of

195
00:08:16,500 --> 00:08:18,509
started the animation and once the

196
00:08:18,509 --> 00:08:21,180
transition ends I will see what kind of

197
00:08:21,180 --> 00:08:24,539
property is is it right now in the event

198
00:08:24,539 --> 00:08:27,150
so if I go back you can see that I'm

199
00:08:27,150 --> 00:08:28,949
changing a lot of things I'm changing

200
00:08:28,949 --> 00:08:30,509
the width I'm changing the height and

201
00:08:30,509 --> 00:08:32,940
I'm also giving different aspects to

202
00:08:32,940 --> 00:08:34,559
this for instance bottom left right

203
00:08:34,559 --> 00:08:37,679
width but I'm making sure that whatever

204
00:08:37,679 --> 00:08:41,820
I'm using and whichever item has the

205
00:08:41,820 --> 00:08:43,919
maximum amount of number for instance

206
00:08:43,919 --> 00:08:47,610
bottom right now has 0.6 second while

207
00:08:47,610 --> 00:08:50,579
the other half 0.3 seconds so I will

208
00:08:50,579 --> 00:08:53,730
look for this bottom field for now

209
00:08:53,730 --> 00:08:56,040
I have used wit but I can use water and

210
00:08:56,040 --> 00:08:58,290
then once I see this property has

211
00:08:58,290 --> 00:09:00,779
finished transition I can basically

212
00:09:00,779 --> 00:09:02,760
activate the portal and that's how you

213
00:09:02,760 --> 00:09:04,730
can simply do that

214
00:09:04,730 --> 00:09:08,850
but one of the problems that users think

215
00:09:08,850 --> 00:09:11,820
about navigating to a new page for

216
00:09:11,820 --> 00:09:15,209
instance you have your own collection of

217
00:09:15,209 --> 00:09:17,970
stores for instance and now you have a

218
00:09:17,970 --> 00:09:20,130
portal which takes the user to another

219
00:09:20,130 --> 00:09:22,529
store which is a separate domain now the

220
00:09:22,529 --> 00:09:24,870
user has left your site and you might

221
00:09:24,870 --> 00:09:26,880
have functionality associated with that

222
00:09:26,880 --> 00:09:30,000
user so the user might not see it but

223
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:33,060
for your application it's like where did

224
00:09:33,060 --> 00:09:35,310
the user go and how to get the user back

225
00:09:35,310 --> 00:09:37,800
on track if there is a whole experience

226
00:09:37,800 --> 00:09:40,560
bound to it so in that case we have

227
00:09:40,560 --> 00:09:42,959
something called adopt predecessor and

228
00:09:42,959 --> 00:09:45,990
what it does is that from site a you

229
00:09:45,990 --> 00:09:47,670
activate the portal and navigate to site

230
00:09:47,670 --> 00:09:51,089
B and from site B you can actually go to

231
00:09:51,089 --> 00:09:54,149
site a but it won't be a back transition

232
00:09:54,149 --> 00:09:57,630
because it always moves forward and I'm

233
00:09:57,630 --> 00:09:59,130
gonna show you how that actually works

234
00:09:59,130 --> 00:10:02,040
so for instance I'm gonna show this

235
00:10:02,040 --> 00:10:04,110
example with two different domains one

236
00:10:04,110 --> 00:10:06,269
is s and is calm which is my website and

237
00:10:06,269 --> 00:10:10,260
the other is awesome github projects dot

238
00:10:10,260 --> 00:10:11,069
firebase.com

239
00:10:11,069 --> 00:10:13,050
so these are totally dudes separate

240
00:10:13,050 --> 00:10:15,569
domains hosted on different places and

241
00:10:15,569 --> 00:10:18,510
I'm actually appending a portal inside

242
00:10:18,510 --> 00:10:21,810
SNS calm so when I click on this this

243
00:10:21,810 --> 00:10:23,639
awesome Gator project becomes the main

244
00:10:23,639 --> 00:10:25,800
page and now it has transitioned to this

245
00:10:25,800 --> 00:10:29,550
but if I have to go back to s and is

246
00:10:29,550 --> 00:10:32,790
calm I can use the adopt predecessor

247
00:10:32,790 --> 00:10:36,300
from the event so I can get that on

248
00:10:36,300 --> 00:10:38,610
awesome geetam projects and then I will

249
00:10:38,610 --> 00:10:40,949
append that as a portal and then it will

250
00:10:40,949 --> 00:10:44,130
go back to s and I are calm and I'm not

251
00:10:44,130 --> 00:10:45,899
going to say back to SNS dot-com because

252
00:10:45,899 --> 00:10:47,970
the transition is all this forward it

253
00:10:47,970 --> 00:10:49,680
goes from s and I all start come to also

254
00:10:49,680 --> 00:10:51,540
get a projects and from awesome github

255
00:10:51,540 --> 00:10:53,490
projects to s and I are calm but it's

256
00:10:53,490 --> 00:10:55,079
always a forward transition there is no

257
00:10:55,079 --> 00:10:57,600
going back and if you think about this

258
00:10:57,600 --> 00:10:59,569
this this seems like some kind of

259
00:10:59,569 --> 00:11:01,350
inception that you are going from one

260
00:11:01,350 --> 00:11:03,089
place to another and then back to it and

261
00:11:03,089 --> 00:11:07,560
then it can go on like this always

262
00:11:07,560 --> 00:11:10,290
it's it's it's kind of a hard concept to

263
00:11:10,290 --> 00:11:12,450
grasp but if you see the examples

264
00:11:12,450 --> 00:11:16,320
obviously my website is also on github

265
00:11:16,320 --> 00:11:18,510
and also this awesome Gator projects is

266
00:11:18,510 --> 00:11:20,400
also on github so I can also share the

267
00:11:20,400 --> 00:11:23,400
links for you to have a peek and get now

268
00:11:23,400 --> 00:11:25,650
we can also use photos in shape of

269
00:11:25,650 --> 00:11:28,100
modal's and this is perhaps one of the

270
00:11:28,100 --> 00:11:31,170
one of the coolest use cases of portals

271
00:11:31,170 --> 00:11:34,770
that you can show a totally separate

272
00:11:34,770 --> 00:11:37,440
domain inside a modal on your website

273
00:11:37,440 --> 00:11:40,380
now this is the example that I'm going

274
00:11:40,380 --> 00:11:43,890
to show you so I have some projects that

275
00:11:43,890 --> 00:11:46,440
I have built on github and then I'm

276
00:11:46,440 --> 00:11:49,620
actually embedding them as portals in my

277
00:11:49,620 --> 00:11:52,830
own website so this whole page is

278
00:11:52,830 --> 00:11:55,830
actually SNS calm but when I click on

279
00:11:55,830 --> 00:11:58,470
this this goes to a new domain that you

280
00:11:58,470 --> 00:12:00,540
can see in this header you can see that

281
00:12:00,540 --> 00:12:03,330
the whole domain the URL changes but you

282
00:12:03,330 --> 00:12:04,589
can see that it is still looks the same

283
00:12:04,589 --> 00:12:06,120
so how does it happen

284
00:12:06,120 --> 00:12:08,580
first of all we animate the portal

285
00:12:08,580 --> 00:12:11,940
element then we activate the portal

286
00:12:11,940 --> 00:12:14,610
element so you can see that it goes up

287
00:12:14,610 --> 00:12:17,130
and then we are activating the portal

288
00:12:17,130 --> 00:12:19,800
now the fun part is when it goes to the

289
00:12:19,800 --> 00:12:22,800
new page this one is actually the main

290
00:12:22,800 --> 00:12:24,990
page this box that you see is actually

291
00:12:24,990 --> 00:12:27,960
on the second website awesome creative

292
00:12:27,960 --> 00:12:29,940
projects calm and what you see behind

293
00:12:29,940 --> 00:12:33,089
them is actually a portal of the first

294
00:12:33,089 --> 00:12:35,250
websites so it's kind of wrapping around

295
00:12:35,250 --> 00:12:37,950
this concept of how we use portal and

296
00:12:37,950 --> 00:12:41,610
then when you have to go back or go to

297
00:12:41,610 --> 00:12:44,040
the first website again what we do is

298
00:12:44,040 --> 00:12:45,750
that you can see that it starts with

299
00:12:45,750 --> 00:12:47,910
awesome guiter projects but then it

300
00:12:47,910 --> 00:12:50,160
animates back to its original position

301
00:12:50,160 --> 00:12:52,470
now this is where we are communicating

302
00:12:52,470 --> 00:12:55,470
between portals from sorry from the

303
00:12:55,470 --> 00:12:58,830
first website we animate from let's say

304
00:12:58,830 --> 00:13:01,320
position Y to a particular place and

305
00:13:01,320 --> 00:13:04,140
then when we reach the second website we

306
00:13:04,140 --> 00:13:06,150
are passing that value to the second

307
00:13:06,150 --> 00:13:08,220
page already that this was the initial

308
00:13:08,220 --> 00:13:10,529
position that we have to move back if we

309
00:13:10,529 --> 00:13:13,140
are going back to the first website so

310
00:13:13,140 --> 00:13:14,430
I'm going to show you the demo as well

311
00:13:14,430 --> 00:13:16,230
and then it will make it more clear for

312
00:13:16,230 --> 00:13:17,030
you

313
00:13:17,030 --> 00:13:20,220
now for going back again

314
00:13:20,220 --> 00:13:22,170
the concept is the same you animate

315
00:13:22,170 --> 00:13:23,970
first and then you activate the porter

316
00:13:23,970 --> 00:13:25,650
so you can see that it starts on the

317
00:13:25,650 --> 00:13:27,000
second website in the header

318
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:29,400
it animates and then by the time it

319
00:13:29,400 --> 00:13:32,220
activates it isn't back to s and is calm

320
00:13:32,220 --> 00:13:36,750
and as I said that portals can

321
00:13:36,750 --> 00:13:39,120
communicate to among themselves and how

322
00:13:39,120 --> 00:13:41,520
do you do that for this what I've done

323
00:13:41,520 --> 00:13:45,000
is that on SAS comm we have this code we

324
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:48,090
create the portal we do a post message

325
00:13:48,090 --> 00:13:52,290
to the portal with initial width or the

326
00:13:52,290 --> 00:13:54,360
Y position as well that where it is

327
00:13:54,360 --> 00:13:57,180
starting from and we are also providing

328
00:13:57,180 --> 00:14:00,420
the origin so this origin is necessary

329
00:14:00,420 --> 00:14:03,390
to be provided because of because of any

330
00:14:03,390 --> 00:14:06,000
security vulnerabilities so the next

331
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:08,700
website knows where this portal is being

332
00:14:08,700 --> 00:14:12,090
activated from and then on the next

333
00:14:12,090 --> 00:14:14,490
website or the second awesome github

334
00:14:14,490 --> 00:14:17,280
project where five is calm I'm listening

335
00:14:17,280 --> 00:14:19,110
for this message so from the first

336
00:14:19,110 --> 00:14:21,240
website we send this from the second one

337
00:14:21,240 --> 00:14:23,640
we get that message and then we take out

338
00:14:23,640 --> 00:14:25,710
the initial width that was passed from

339
00:14:25,710 --> 00:14:27,270
the first website and then we can do

340
00:14:27,270 --> 00:14:31,500
whatever we want with that now if I go

341
00:14:31,500 --> 00:14:33,870
forward this is one thing that I would

342
00:14:33,870 --> 00:14:35,880
like to share and this is really

343
00:14:35,880 --> 00:14:38,160
important to understand that poodle is

344
00:14:38,160 --> 00:14:40,710
not something that you can use for

345
00:14:40,710 --> 00:14:44,190
everything it also have has its caveats

346
00:14:44,190 --> 00:14:46,200
you have to be really careful when using

347
00:14:46,200 --> 00:14:48,180
it and you have to consider the security

348
00:14:48,180 --> 00:14:51,930
vulnerabilities as well sorry and also

349
00:14:51,930 --> 00:14:53,460
one thing that you need to consider is

350
00:14:53,460 --> 00:14:56,610
you cannot have a lot of portals in your

351
00:14:56,610 --> 00:14:58,410
page because what it does is that when

352
00:14:58,410 --> 00:15:00,630
you create a portal it loads the second

353
00:15:00,630 --> 00:15:03,390
website completely in that photo so if

354
00:15:03,390 --> 00:15:05,340
you have let's say a thousand list items

355
00:15:05,340 --> 00:15:08,430
and for all of those you have portals in

356
00:15:08,430 --> 00:15:10,950
there when the user opens your website

357
00:15:10,950 --> 00:15:13,170
it will start loading content for those

358
00:15:13,170 --> 00:15:15,870
thousand websites if they are different

359
00:15:15,870 --> 00:15:17,610
that's going to be a bigger problem but

360
00:15:17,610 --> 00:15:19,170
if they are same there might be some

361
00:15:19,170 --> 00:15:21,120
caching that might help it but again

362
00:15:21,120 --> 00:15:23,160
it's not a really good idea to put a lot

363
00:15:23,160 --> 00:15:25,710
of poodles in your website but you can

364
00:15:25,710 --> 00:15:28,020
put a single portal and then dynamically

365
00:15:28,020 --> 00:15:30,150
change its source and load it and then

366
00:15:30,150 --> 00:15:32,040
activate it and then you can optimize it

367
00:15:32,040 --> 00:15:33,790
as you

368
00:15:33,790 --> 00:15:37,490
now before going to question I'm just

369
00:15:37,490 --> 00:15:41,120
gonna show you a demo so this is my

370
00:15:41,120 --> 00:15:44,990
website and if I try to use this on a

371
00:15:44,990 --> 00:15:48,140
normal Chrome browser let me show you so

372
00:15:48,140 --> 00:15:52,130
if I go here and if I show you this one

373
00:15:52,130 --> 00:15:55,520
so this is with the flags disabled so

374
00:15:55,520 --> 00:15:56,900
you can see that it just says this

375
00:15:56,900 --> 00:15:59,300
project and if I like this it will

376
00:15:59,300 --> 00:16:01,100
basically take me to awesome github

377
00:16:01,100 --> 00:16:03,830
projects firebase.com and these are the

378
00:16:03,830 --> 00:16:06,920
projects as list items but if I go to

379
00:16:06,920 --> 00:16:10,070
Chrome cannery with the flag enable you

380
00:16:10,070 --> 00:16:11,690
can see that if I scroll down you see

381
00:16:11,690 --> 00:16:13,730
all of these portals right here and

382
00:16:13,730 --> 00:16:16,070
these are all different items that I

383
00:16:16,070 --> 00:16:18,740
have configured with the other app as

384
00:16:18,740 --> 00:16:22,370
well now I can click on any item and you

385
00:16:22,370 --> 00:16:24,770
can see that it goes up to this position

386
00:16:24,770 --> 00:16:27,080
and now we are on the second website and

387
00:16:27,080 --> 00:16:29,300
if I click back you can see that it

388
00:16:29,300 --> 00:16:31,580
navigates back to its original position

389
00:16:31,580 --> 00:16:33,830
so I'm actually communicating from the

390
00:16:33,830 --> 00:16:35,720
first side what is the initial position

391
00:16:35,720 --> 00:16:38,420
that I'm animating from and in the next

392
00:16:38,420 --> 00:16:41,120
website I'm actually going back to that

393
00:16:41,120 --> 00:16:43,070
position before it goes back to the

394
00:16:43,070 --> 00:16:44,900
first page so for instance for this one

395
00:16:44,900 --> 00:16:47,390
it will navigate to here it will go back

396
00:16:47,390 --> 00:16:50,060
to its position from here you can see it

397
00:16:50,060 --> 00:16:52,430
activates goes back to its position so

398
00:16:52,430 --> 00:16:53,960
this is how give it how you can provide

399
00:16:53,960 --> 00:16:56,450
a really neat you are and the user might

400
00:16:56,450 --> 00:16:58,730
not even know that they are different

401
00:16:58,730 --> 00:17:00,920
domains or you can do a lot of things

402
00:17:00,920 --> 00:17:06,290
with this this technique now before we

403
00:17:06,290 --> 00:17:11,079
wrap up I would actually like to have

404
00:17:11,079 --> 00:17:16,880
questions the most interesting part all

405
00:17:16,880 --> 00:17:18,170
right let me you'll let me be on the

406
00:17:18,170 --> 00:17:20,329
stream yes all right

407
00:17:20,329 --> 00:17:21,589
you can now you can hear me properly

408
00:17:21,589 --> 00:17:23,480
right yes I do

409
00:17:23,480 --> 00:17:26,170
okay I've got a one question up here and

410
00:17:26,170 --> 00:17:29,330
what is this portal stuff is this

411
00:17:29,330 --> 00:17:31,790
supported for every browser or just

412
00:17:31,790 --> 00:17:33,650
Chrome or can you tell me about

413
00:17:33,650 --> 00:17:35,900
something about that yes so it is

414
00:17:35,900 --> 00:17:38,090
actually introduced by the chrome team

415
00:17:38,090 --> 00:17:40,160
so this is only available for chrome now

416
00:17:40,160 --> 00:17:42,440
but there is a hope that this might be

417
00:17:42,440 --> 00:17:44,810
later on adopted by other browsers as

418
00:17:44,810 --> 00:17:46,050
well

419
00:17:46,050 --> 00:17:48,700
okay and what do you think is the

420
00:17:48,700 --> 00:17:50,710
biggest concern or the biggest mistake

421
00:17:50,710 --> 00:17:52,600
that people people make when using

422
00:17:52,600 --> 00:17:54,520
portals is that loading the whole page

423
00:17:54,520 --> 00:17:58,870
as you described into a portal or yes so

424
00:17:58,870 --> 00:18:01,060
for instance the elements that you see

425
00:18:01,060 --> 00:18:03,970
here there are lot of portals here like

426
00:18:03,970 --> 00:18:05,740
three four or five how many items they

427
00:18:05,740 --> 00:18:09,460
are so if you put a lot of photos with

428
00:18:09,460 --> 00:18:12,010
different URLs in a single page if a

429
00:18:12,010 --> 00:18:14,200
user is on a slow network or is using

430
00:18:14,200 --> 00:18:16,810
data this will cost a lot to the user

431
00:18:16,810 --> 00:18:18,550
because it will start loading all of the

432
00:18:18,550 --> 00:18:20,470
content and you cannot stop it so one

433
00:18:20,470 --> 00:18:22,600
thick would be using only one portal and

434
00:18:22,600 --> 00:18:24,790
kind of managing it dynamically with the

435
00:18:24,790 --> 00:18:26,500
source and then appending on the body

436
00:18:26,500 --> 00:18:29,050
and and yeah optimizing it and the other

437
00:18:29,050 --> 00:18:32,980
mistake that usually happens with

438
00:18:32,980 --> 00:18:38,110
portals is that yeah I think yeah that's

439
00:18:38,110 --> 00:18:40,060
that's probably the only idea that I can

440
00:18:40,060 --> 00:18:44,560
show how does this work when you do

441
00:18:44,560 --> 00:18:46,630
previous and next on navigation buttons

442
00:18:46,630 --> 00:18:48,430
does that make the portal and the

443
00:18:48,430 --> 00:18:50,980
animation go up again or can you tell me

444
00:18:50,980 --> 00:18:53,770
something about that yes so for instance

445
00:18:53,770 --> 00:18:57,010
if I'm going back here you can see that

446
00:18:57,010 --> 00:18:59,080
you can actually navigate to back and

447
00:18:59,080 --> 00:19:01,390
forth with the portals so this actually

448
00:19:01,390 --> 00:19:05,350
works pretty well when you are using

449
00:19:05,350 --> 00:19:07,600
history button so every time you go to

450
00:19:07,600 --> 00:19:08,920
portal it will push through your history

451
00:19:08,920 --> 00:19:11,310
and then you can navigate back and forth

452
00:19:11,310 --> 00:19:16,450
okay cool how much does this does this

453
00:19:16,450 --> 00:19:21,130
whole port thing impact performance as I

454
00:19:21,130 --> 00:19:23,710
said if it's quite similar to how you're

455
00:19:23,710 --> 00:19:27,520
using iframes so all the concerns that

456
00:19:27,520 --> 00:19:29,620
you might have for that also applies to

457
00:19:29,620 --> 00:19:32,410
portals for instance could there be any

458
00:19:32,410 --> 00:19:34,720
security flaws when using iframes or

459
00:19:34,720 --> 00:19:36,940
portals so all of that actually applies

460
00:19:36,940 --> 00:19:39,280
to photos as well and also again if

461
00:19:39,280 --> 00:19:40,990
you're using a lot of iframes it's also

462
00:19:40,990 --> 00:19:42,490
bad if you're using a lot of portals

463
00:19:42,490 --> 00:19:44,320
element it's also bad so you could

464
00:19:44,320 --> 00:19:45,820
probably show some images in the

465
00:19:45,820 --> 00:19:47,740
beginning and then just use one portal

466
00:19:47,740 --> 00:19:50,950
to do all the magic all right sounds

467
00:19:50,950 --> 00:19:52,630
sounds legit sounds interesting I have

468
00:19:52,630 --> 00:19:54,400
never tried it to be honest but I'm not

469
00:19:54,400 --> 00:19:56,200
a front a front-end engineer so that's

470
00:19:56,200 --> 00:19:59,200
but because because so far that are the

471
00:19:59,200 --> 00:19:59,740
questions

472
00:19:59,740 --> 00:20:02,320
I have four now we have a few minutes

473
00:20:02,320 --> 00:20:04,840
left and I know you have at least one

474
00:20:04,840 --> 00:20:07,300
slide if I'm not mistaken so yes I will

475
00:20:07,300 --> 00:20:09,910
put I will put the screen back up let's

476
00:20:09,910 --> 00:20:10,240
go

477
00:20:10,240 --> 00:20:14,230
awesome so yeah I think before we yeah

478
00:20:14,230 --> 00:20:17,730
it's just one silly slide but yeah if we

479
00:20:17,730 --> 00:20:19,929
go from here

480
00:20:19,929 --> 00:20:22,740
learning something if I try to go back

481
00:20:22,740 --> 00:20:24,390
yes

482
00:20:24,390 --> 00:20:28,840
oops now let's see so yeah this is one

483
00:20:28,840 --> 00:20:33,090
clip that I always gave to my viewers if

484
00:20:33,090 --> 00:20:36,790
this plays nope it doesn't for some

485
00:20:36,790 --> 00:20:40,179
reason Oh a place so yeah so the tip is

486
00:20:40,179 --> 00:20:42,010
never take your dog to snowboarding

487
00:20:42,010 --> 00:20:49,270
because yeah you might end it so I would

488
00:20:49,270 --> 00:20:50,830
say thank you for having me this was a

489
00:20:50,830 --> 00:20:53,950
really good good thing for me being at

490
00:20:53,950 --> 00:20:57,550
home so I really loved it thank you all

491
00:20:57,550 --> 00:21:00,370
right thank you Muhammad for for being
