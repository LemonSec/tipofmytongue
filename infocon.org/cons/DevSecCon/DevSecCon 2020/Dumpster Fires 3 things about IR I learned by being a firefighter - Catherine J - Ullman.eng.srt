1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,190
just jump to a different streaming stock

2
00:00:02,190 --> 00:00:04,490
for a second and I'm joined now by Kathy

3
00:00:04,490 --> 00:00:07,319
and Kathy Avicii on a race and an

4
00:00:07,319 --> 00:00:08,580
amazing introduction whilst we were

5
00:00:08,580 --> 00:00:09,540
trying to deal with the technical

6
00:00:09,540 --> 00:00:11,700
difficulties so yeah if you just want to

7
00:00:11,700 --> 00:00:13,920
pop onto screen share and jump straight

8
00:00:13,920 --> 00:00:17,789
into it alrighty thank you so much for

9
00:00:17,789 --> 00:00:23,519
having me give this a whirl hopefully

10
00:00:23,519 --> 00:00:25,050
you can see my presentation at this

11
00:00:25,050 --> 00:00:27,480
point perfect I can see you and your

12
00:00:27,480 --> 00:00:31,830
presentation outstanding okay well thank

13
00:00:31,830 --> 00:00:33,420
you so much again for having me and

14
00:00:33,420 --> 00:00:35,160
we'll talk a little bit about dumpster

15
00:00:35,160 --> 00:00:37,860
fires I know that in the security

16
00:00:37,860 --> 00:00:40,050
universe we often like to compare

17
00:00:40,050 --> 00:00:42,600
dumpster fires to incident response and

18
00:00:42,600 --> 00:00:45,450
other things in security and I thought

19
00:00:45,450 --> 00:00:47,399
gee you know I know a lot about dumpster

20
00:00:47,399 --> 00:00:49,079
fires because I've been a firefighter

21
00:00:49,079 --> 00:00:52,079
for a number of years and I thought

22
00:00:52,079 --> 00:00:53,699
perhaps I could bring some interesting

23
00:00:53,699 --> 00:00:55,860
thoughts about the comparison between

24
00:00:55,860 --> 00:00:59,910
incident response and firefighting so a

25
00:00:59,910 --> 00:01:01,739
little bit about what we're going to

26
00:01:01,739 --> 00:01:04,580
discuss we'll do a little bit about

27
00:01:04,580 --> 00:01:07,590
Incident Response firefighting a little

28
00:01:07,590 --> 00:01:10,650
bit about the comparison and then we'll

29
00:01:10,650 --> 00:01:12,210
talk about some opportunities and

30
00:01:12,210 --> 00:01:14,700
challenges that I've learned through

31
00:01:14,700 --> 00:01:16,740
seeing the two of these things together

32
00:01:16,740 --> 00:01:18,840
summarize some information and give you

33
00:01:18,840 --> 00:01:22,560
some final thoughts on that so here's a

34
00:01:22,560 --> 00:01:24,479
little bit about me this is me on the

35
00:01:24,479 --> 00:01:26,729
cyber side I've been at the University

36
00:01:26,729 --> 00:01:30,060
of Buffalo for over 20 years now doing a

37
00:01:30,060 --> 00:01:32,369
variety of forensics and other security

38
00:01:32,369 --> 00:01:34,590
stuff I'm involved in a lot of places

39
00:01:34,590 --> 00:01:36,799
done a lot of talks have a few certs

40
00:01:36,799 --> 00:01:39,060
this is the one that most people don't

41
00:01:39,060 --> 00:01:41,430
see I'm a state fire instructor with New

42
00:01:41,430 --> 00:01:42,960
York State Office of fire prevention and

43
00:01:42,960 --> 00:01:45,299
control I have a bunch of credits toward

44
00:01:45,299 --> 00:01:48,119
a community college degree which I never

45
00:01:48,119 --> 00:01:49,979
really had a reason to finish but

46
00:01:49,979 --> 00:01:52,470
learned a bunch of stuff and I used to

47
00:01:52,470 --> 00:01:55,020
be a fire investigator and was certified

48
00:01:55,020 --> 00:01:57,840
by New York State and involved in a

49
00:01:57,840 --> 00:02:00,869
bunch of other fire stuff so I have

50
00:02:00,869 --> 00:02:03,180
background in both places and that's why

51
00:02:03,180 --> 00:02:05,040
I thought I would have something to say

52
00:02:05,040 --> 00:02:08,098
about this so just in case you think I'm

53
00:02:08,098 --> 00:02:10,800
kidding that's me out of fire that my

54
00:02:10,800 --> 00:02:12,930
fire department recently had

55
00:02:12,930 --> 00:02:15,110
this was just before Christmas and

56
00:02:15,110 --> 00:02:18,060
that's me in the middle here and I am

57
00:02:18,060 --> 00:02:19,650
holding what is called a thermal camera

58
00:02:19,650 --> 00:02:22,230
which is a tool that we use when we are

59
00:02:22,230 --> 00:02:24,060
going to fires to have an idea of where

60
00:02:24,060 --> 00:02:26,849
those hotspots might be the heat

61
00:02:26,849 --> 00:02:30,000
indicators so just like I said in case

62
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:33,209
you were thinking I was joking I really

63
00:02:33,209 --> 00:02:34,530
am a firefighter this really is

64
00:02:34,530 --> 00:02:37,530
something I do in my spare time so let's

65
00:02:37,530 --> 00:02:39,120
talk a little bit about Incident

66
00:02:39,120 --> 00:02:42,360
Response Incident Response as you can

67
00:02:42,360 --> 00:02:44,819
see I like to define it pretty basic as

68
00:02:44,819 --> 00:02:46,650
this process of addressing Network

69
00:02:46,650 --> 00:02:48,739
events and I don't like to give any

70
00:02:48,739 --> 00:02:51,989
particular good or bad it just it's

71
00:02:51,989 --> 00:02:53,790
addressing Network events what those

72
00:02:53,790 --> 00:02:55,590
events are will determine good or bad

73
00:02:55,590 --> 00:02:58,620
but responding doesn't necessarily mean

74
00:02:58,620 --> 00:02:59,489
it's a bad thing

75
00:02:59,489 --> 00:03:02,250
and we can do some kinds of proactive

76
00:03:02,250 --> 00:03:04,470
and reactive responses if are maybe

77
00:03:04,470 --> 00:03:06,690
looking at logs and trying to do some

78
00:03:06,690 --> 00:03:08,819
preventative work but basically any

79
00:03:08,819 --> 00:03:11,129
event that potentially could affect the

80
00:03:11,129 --> 00:03:15,030
CI a triangle and you know obviously

81
00:03:15,030 --> 00:03:17,310
could potentially do some harm that's

82
00:03:17,310 --> 00:03:19,019
really what we're talking about here and

83
00:03:19,019 --> 00:03:20,940
it's going to be these technical

84
00:03:20,940 --> 00:03:22,769
components required to analyze and

85
00:03:22,769 --> 00:03:24,359
contain an incident and I'll mention

86
00:03:24,359 --> 00:03:26,940
you'll see why I mentioned the technical

87
00:03:26,940 --> 00:03:28,650
components when I talk a little bit

88
00:03:28,650 --> 00:03:30,799
about one other piece later

89
00:03:30,799 --> 00:03:35,910
so Incident Response in general these

90
00:03:35,910 --> 00:03:37,799
are the goals right we want to make sure

91
00:03:37,799 --> 00:03:40,709
that we stop the attacker we want to

92
00:03:40,709 --> 00:03:42,150
make sure we know that someone is

93
00:03:42,150 --> 00:03:44,010
obviously doing something we're going to

94
00:03:44,010 --> 00:03:45,959
minimize that damage and prevent any

95
00:03:45,959 --> 00:03:48,209
sort of future attacks or similar

96
00:03:48,209 --> 00:03:53,910
incidents these are your standard phases

97
00:03:53,910 --> 00:03:55,859
of Incident Response anybody who does

98
00:03:55,859 --> 00:03:57,599
Incident Response is probably familiar

99
00:03:57,599 --> 00:04:00,060
with the idea of preparing identifying

100
00:04:00,060 --> 00:04:02,010
what your incident is containing it

101
00:04:02,010 --> 00:04:03,949
trying to get rid of the bad guy

102
00:04:03,949 --> 00:04:07,169
recovering and learning some lessons so

103
00:04:07,169 --> 00:04:08,940
these are this is a pretty standard

104
00:04:08,940 --> 00:04:12,480
chart that we see now let's talk about

105
00:04:12,480 --> 00:04:15,090
what being a firefighter is should be

106
00:04:15,090 --> 00:04:16,769
fairly obvious we're gonna try to

107
00:04:16,769 --> 00:04:18,599
prevent the spread and extinguish

108
00:04:18,599 --> 00:04:20,659
unwanted fires in buildings vehicles

109
00:04:20,659 --> 00:04:23,430
woodlands whatever and I specifically

110
00:04:23,430 --> 00:04:26,670
mention unwanted fires because obviously

111
00:04:26,670 --> 00:04:28,260
people do have fires they want you have

112
00:04:28,260 --> 00:04:30,750
fires in your fireplace fires and fire

113
00:04:30,750 --> 00:04:33,210
pits some people live in the country and

114
00:04:33,210 --> 00:04:36,320
they do different kinds of burning of

115
00:04:36,320 --> 00:04:41,330
say wood or leaves things like that so

116
00:04:41,330 --> 00:04:44,490
these are our goals as firefighters we

117
00:04:44,490 --> 00:04:46,830
want to protect the safety and health of

118
00:04:46,830 --> 00:04:49,080
folks we want to make sure that property

119
00:04:49,080 --> 00:04:51,030
the public and private property in the

120
00:04:51,030 --> 00:04:53,190
environment are protected and minimize

121
00:04:53,190 --> 00:04:56,030
disruption of community activities

122
00:04:56,030 --> 00:04:58,440
you'll see that we in the fire service

123
00:04:58,440 --> 00:05:00,810
have a very similar preparedness cycle

124
00:05:00,810 --> 00:05:04,080
so we have this idea of preparation and

125
00:05:04,080 --> 00:05:06,540
usually that comes at some point before

126
00:05:06,540 --> 00:05:07,980
whatever the emergency that we're going

127
00:05:07,980 --> 00:05:10,170
to is and then we have a response to

128
00:05:10,170 --> 00:05:11,940
that emergency we have a recovery and

129
00:05:11,940 --> 00:05:14,180
mitigation and we're back to preparation

130
00:05:14,180 --> 00:05:18,980
this should start to seem very similar

131
00:05:19,760 --> 00:05:22,440
so I broke it down for you with some

132
00:05:22,440 --> 00:05:24,420
details but basically this is what we're

133
00:05:24,420 --> 00:05:26,010
talking about right so we want to

134
00:05:26,010 --> 00:05:28,800
prevent these future emergencies we use

135
00:05:28,800 --> 00:05:31,620
smoke detectors sprinklers we do various

136
00:05:31,620 --> 00:05:33,840
kinds of awareness just like we do in

137
00:05:33,840 --> 00:05:37,800
security we also prepare to handle the

138
00:05:37,800 --> 00:05:39,660
emergency by doing things like pre plans

139
00:05:39,660 --> 00:05:41,460
and making sure our gear is up to snuff

140
00:05:41,460 --> 00:05:44,370
and then when we respond we're gonna

141
00:05:44,370 --> 00:05:46,560
respond safely to an emergency we're

142
00:05:46,560 --> 00:05:48,120
gonna try to save those property and

143
00:05:48,120 --> 00:05:50,010
lives and our recovery is going to

144
00:05:50,010 --> 00:05:51,750
involve recovering from an emergency

145
00:05:51,750 --> 00:05:53,700
which means cleaning up restoring

146
00:05:53,700 --> 00:05:56,370
repairing which we don't necessarily do

147
00:05:56,370 --> 00:05:58,170
all of directly but it is part of the

148
00:05:58,170 --> 00:06:02,910
process so here's a picture that I'm

149
00:06:02,910 --> 00:06:04,920
actually going to come back to later but

150
00:06:04,920 --> 00:06:06,840
I want you to notice the picture on the

151
00:06:06,840 --> 00:06:10,170
left although you can't tell is me I am

152
00:06:10,170 --> 00:06:12,630
changing an air bottle on what's called

153
00:06:12,630 --> 00:06:15,660
an SCBA and SCBA is self-contained

154
00:06:15,660 --> 00:06:17,790
breathing apparatus much like a scuba

155
00:06:17,790 --> 00:06:20,010
tank is for somebody who does underwater

156
00:06:20,010 --> 00:06:22,050
diving but it's for firefighters to be

157
00:06:22,050 --> 00:06:25,140
able to breathe air inside a structure

158
00:06:25,140 --> 00:06:27,390
where the air has been compromised with

159
00:06:27,390 --> 00:06:30,660
all kinds of bad stuff what I didn't

160
00:06:30,660 --> 00:06:33,180
notice right away is that the tank

161
00:06:33,180 --> 00:06:36,060
actually had been compromised not the

162
00:06:36,060 --> 00:06:38,280
physical tank itself I'm sorry but the

163
00:06:38,280 --> 00:06:40,650
hoses that can tie that take

164
00:06:40,650 --> 00:06:43,110
the air from the tank to the individual

165
00:06:43,110 --> 00:06:45,660
wearing it you'll notice in the picture

166
00:06:45,660 --> 00:06:47,460
on the right there is significant damage

167
00:06:47,460 --> 00:06:50,010
on the shoulder of the firefighter

168
00:06:50,010 --> 00:06:52,800
wearing the pack so that's kind of a

169
00:06:52,800 --> 00:06:55,550
close-up of that particular individual

170
00:06:55,550 --> 00:06:59,040
this is not a good thing and we'll talk

171
00:06:59,040 --> 00:07:01,530
a little bit more about why this is a

172
00:07:01,530 --> 00:07:04,020
problem later but let's just say because

173
00:07:04,020 --> 00:07:06,720
I was in a hurry and wasn't necessarily

174
00:07:06,720 --> 00:07:08,729
paying attention to those signs

175
00:07:08,729 --> 00:07:10,620
I got a blast of air in the face that

176
00:07:10,620 --> 00:07:12,840
could have been a lot more dangerous so

177
00:07:12,840 --> 00:07:16,350
I will return to that idea another piece

178
00:07:16,350 --> 00:07:18,180
of terminology I want to make you

179
00:07:18,180 --> 00:07:19,620
familiar with which is going to be a

180
00:07:19,620 --> 00:07:21,300
little confusing to those of you who

181
00:07:21,300 --> 00:07:23,400
know ICS to be something very different

182
00:07:23,400 --> 00:07:25,080
but in the fire service we have

183
00:07:25,080 --> 00:07:26,460
something called the incident command

184
00:07:26,460 --> 00:07:28,830
system and really the whole idea with

185
00:07:28,830 --> 00:07:30,449
this you can read the detailed

186
00:07:30,449 --> 00:07:32,610
description here but it's an organized

187
00:07:32,610 --> 00:07:35,010
response to a problem we have a

188
00:07:35,010 --> 00:07:37,770
hierarchy that we go by in terms of who

189
00:07:37,770 --> 00:07:40,590
responds and who speaks to whom on the

190
00:07:40,590 --> 00:07:43,560
fire scene this is something that's very

191
00:07:43,560 --> 00:07:46,320
important for making sure that when we

192
00:07:46,320 --> 00:07:48,360
aren't on a fire scene that we stay

193
00:07:48,360 --> 00:07:50,940
organized both within our own units and

194
00:07:50,940 --> 00:07:52,889
when we're bringing in mutual aid this

195
00:07:52,889 --> 00:07:57,360
is incredibly helpful this is just a

196
00:07:57,360 --> 00:07:58,950
small picture of the incident command

197
00:07:58,950 --> 00:08:00,750
system and the idea behind this is that

198
00:08:00,750 --> 00:08:02,910
it can grow exponentially so if you have

199
00:08:02,910 --> 00:08:05,760
multiple units or different fire

200
00:08:05,760 --> 00:08:08,430
departments maybe people coming from far

201
00:08:08,430 --> 00:08:10,050
away they're going to follow this same

202
00:08:10,050 --> 00:08:13,320
structure so your incident commander and

203
00:08:13,320 --> 00:08:15,930
your operations section are probably the

204
00:08:15,930 --> 00:08:18,419
pieces that you would interact with the

205
00:08:18,419 --> 00:08:20,419
most as a regular firefighter

206
00:08:20,419 --> 00:08:23,910
you don't you might interface with the

207
00:08:23,910 --> 00:08:25,349
safety officer if there is something

208
00:08:25,349 --> 00:08:28,169
unsafe happening but we'll talk a little

209
00:08:28,169 --> 00:08:31,500
bit about those so your your eye see is

210
00:08:31,500 --> 00:08:33,390
going to define what the goal is and

211
00:08:33,390 --> 00:08:35,159
typically it's going to be somewhat

212
00:08:35,159 --> 00:08:37,320
obvious and the goal is to put the fire

213
00:08:37,320 --> 00:08:39,510
out if it's a fire or if we're going to

214
00:08:39,510 --> 00:08:41,729
something like a car accident it's to

215
00:08:41,729 --> 00:08:43,740
get the people out of the car or to make

216
00:08:43,740 --> 00:08:47,190
the scene safe so that folks can get by

217
00:08:47,190 --> 00:08:50,250
in their vehicles the operations people

218
00:08:50,250 --> 00:08:51,810
are going to figure out exactly how

219
00:08:51,810 --> 00:08:53,760
we're going to do that so they take

220
00:08:53,760 --> 00:08:56,340
strategy and tactics and using that

221
00:08:56,340 --> 00:08:58,470
those approach in those actions that's

222
00:08:58,470 --> 00:09:00,780
how we're going to go about it so the

223
00:09:00,780 --> 00:09:02,790
folks who are on the scene who are

224
00:09:02,790 --> 00:09:05,040
actually doing the responding they're

225
00:09:05,040 --> 00:09:06,900
going to report to the operations people

226
00:09:06,900 --> 00:09:09,990
who are getting their roles from the

227
00:09:09,990 --> 00:09:12,240
incident commander logistics planning

228
00:09:12,240 --> 00:09:15,300
and finding it really come more into

229
00:09:15,300 --> 00:09:18,720
play with a larger incident so logistics

230
00:09:18,720 --> 00:09:20,130
is going to be you know we need more

231
00:09:20,130 --> 00:09:21,960
people so our fire department can't

232
00:09:21,960 --> 00:09:23,490
handle it alone we now need to call in

233
00:09:23,490 --> 00:09:24,780
mutual aid so we might have somebody

234
00:09:24,780 --> 00:09:26,400
who's becomes in charge of all those

235
00:09:26,400 --> 00:09:28,980
logistics because it grows to be such an

236
00:09:28,980 --> 00:09:32,790
exponentially large situation planning

237
00:09:32,790 --> 00:09:34,680
if it's going to be something that's

238
00:09:34,680 --> 00:09:36,750
that's lengthy so let's say it's not

239
00:09:36,750 --> 00:09:39,810
just a single fire let's say it's a fire

240
00:09:39,810 --> 00:09:41,850
that's a part of something really big

241
00:09:41,850 --> 00:09:45,410
like an earthquake or a flood situation

242
00:09:45,410 --> 00:09:47,400
or something that's going to take

243
00:09:47,400 --> 00:09:49,980
multiple days and then you know so

244
00:09:49,980 --> 00:09:51,150
that's where this whole idea of

245
00:09:51,150 --> 00:09:53,060
long-range planning and then at the end

246
00:09:53,060 --> 00:09:55,860
demobilization comes in your admin and

247
00:09:55,860 --> 00:09:58,200
your finance that's going to be any kind

248
00:09:58,200 --> 00:10:00,750
of regulation compliance liens

249
00:10:00,750 --> 00:10:02,400
you know licenses if we need anything

250
00:10:02,400 --> 00:10:04,800
like that so let's compare the two a

251
00:10:04,800 --> 00:10:06,960
little bit we've already seen that these

252
00:10:06,960 --> 00:10:09,150
methodologies are really similar and

253
00:10:09,150 --> 00:10:11,310
while there isn't officially a lessons

254
00:10:11,310 --> 00:10:13,320
learned in the firefighting circle that

255
00:10:13,320 --> 00:10:15,930
we saw earlier realistically that is

256
00:10:15,930 --> 00:10:19,740
part of that same process a couple quick

257
00:10:19,740 --> 00:10:21,450
misconceptions because I think these are

258
00:10:21,450 --> 00:10:23,690
important to note

259
00:10:23,690 --> 00:10:26,730
really for ir a lot of people think

260
00:10:26,730 --> 00:10:28,530
every event is an incident and that we

261
00:10:28,530 --> 00:10:30,150
should handle them all the same way and

262
00:10:30,150 --> 00:10:32,400
that they can be solved really fast we

263
00:10:32,400 --> 00:10:34,530
all need to be rockstars and we always

264
00:10:34,530 --> 00:10:36,720
can tell exactly who did it and how and

265
00:10:36,720 --> 00:10:39,240
the reality is that those things are not

266
00:10:39,240 --> 00:10:39,770
true

267
00:10:39,770 --> 00:10:42,180
now many of you might know those things

268
00:10:42,180 --> 00:10:45,090
but I suspect not as many of you realize

269
00:10:45,090 --> 00:10:48,570
that firefighters are not always paid in

270
00:10:48,570 --> 00:10:50,640
fact I'm not paid I'm a volunteer

271
00:10:50,640 --> 00:10:52,260
firefighter I've been a volunteer

272
00:10:52,260 --> 00:10:55,950
firefighter for many years almost 24 now

273
00:10:55,950 --> 00:10:58,950
and I've never been paid a dime I I do

274
00:10:58,950 --> 00:11:00,630
this because it's something I love and

275
00:11:00,630 --> 00:11:02,460
if you hadn't noticed

276
00:11:02,460 --> 00:11:06,570
not a big tough dude that's not who I am

277
00:11:06,570 --> 00:11:08,579
we don't fight every fire the same way

278
00:11:08,579 --> 00:11:10,620
yes we typically put wet stuff on red

279
00:11:10,620 --> 00:11:13,380
stuff but we go about it very

280
00:11:13,380 --> 00:11:14,639
differently depending on the

281
00:11:14,639 --> 00:11:17,430
circumstances we don't extinguish every

282
00:11:17,430 --> 00:11:19,380
fire quickly because it depends on the

283
00:11:19,380 --> 00:11:22,320
situation and it's definitely not always

284
00:11:22,320 --> 00:11:24,089
a full-time job as I mentioned I'm a

285
00:11:24,089 --> 00:11:27,300
volunteer some similarities we've

286
00:11:27,300 --> 00:11:31,079
already seen some obviously we focus on

287
00:11:31,079 --> 00:11:33,029
whatever the immediate problem is right

288
00:11:33,029 --> 00:11:34,800
now and later we're gonna find the cause

289
00:11:34,800 --> 00:11:36,540
so as a fire investigator that was one

290
00:11:36,540 --> 00:11:37,920
of the things that I would do I would go

291
00:11:37,920 --> 00:11:39,720
in and I would determine or help to

292
00:11:39,720 --> 00:11:41,490
determine the origin and the cause of

293
00:11:41,490 --> 00:11:43,920
the fire we use some form of triage

294
00:11:43,920 --> 00:11:45,630
we're going to determine what the best

295
00:11:45,630 --> 00:11:48,529
course of action is based on how serious

296
00:11:48,529 --> 00:11:51,089
the perceived threat might be so

297
00:11:51,089 --> 00:11:52,260
regardless of whether we're talking

298
00:11:52,260 --> 00:11:54,300
incident response or firefighting same

299
00:11:54,300 --> 00:11:56,490
idea there cyclical in nature we've

300
00:11:56,490 --> 00:11:57,930
already seen that with the little

301
00:11:57,930 --> 00:12:00,269
diagrams I showed you they both require

302
00:12:00,269 --> 00:12:03,120
thinking outside the box sometimes you

303
00:12:03,120 --> 00:12:04,560
don't have the right tools you need

304
00:12:04,560 --> 00:12:06,690
sometimes you don't have the tools at

305
00:12:06,690 --> 00:12:07,560
all

306
00:12:07,560 --> 00:12:10,529
I had a friend who's a firefighter with

307
00:12:10,529 --> 00:12:12,720
a city department who had to move a

308
00:12:12,720 --> 00:12:14,970
600-pound person out of a very tiny

309
00:12:14,970 --> 00:12:16,230
third-floor apartment

310
00:12:16,230 --> 00:12:17,970
that wound up going to Home Depot and

311
00:12:17,970 --> 00:12:20,220
getting a bunch of wood and other tools

312
00:12:20,220 --> 00:12:21,810
and building something to get this

313
00:12:21,810 --> 00:12:24,899
individual out so that's not so

314
00:12:24,899 --> 00:12:27,389
different from what we do in IR where we

315
00:12:27,389 --> 00:12:29,310
don't necessarily have exactly the tools

316
00:12:29,310 --> 00:12:30,149
we need on hand

317
00:12:30,149 --> 00:12:31,829
so sometimes we cobble other things

318
00:12:31,829 --> 00:12:34,260
together and we punt we sometimes have

319
00:12:34,260 --> 00:12:35,910
to bring in outside entities sometimes

320
00:12:35,910 --> 00:12:37,470
you need mutual aid whether it's

321
00:12:37,470 --> 00:12:39,000
firefighting and you need another

322
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:41,010
department or whether you need to

323
00:12:41,010 --> 00:12:43,290
consult and bring another entity and to

324
00:12:43,290 --> 00:12:45,329
help you and sometimes there's inside

325
00:12:45,329 --> 00:12:47,730
teams so there are companies who have

326
00:12:47,730 --> 00:12:49,769
firefighting teams right as part of

327
00:12:49,769 --> 00:12:51,199
their organization they're usually

328
00:12:51,199 --> 00:12:53,490
places like factories will have

329
00:12:53,490 --> 00:12:55,949
firefighting teams and you know with

330
00:12:55,949 --> 00:12:57,089
sometimes you have Incident Response

331
00:12:57,089 --> 00:12:58,889
Teams in an organization and sometimes

332
00:12:58,889 --> 00:13:02,579
they hire from outside so now let's take

333
00:13:02,579 --> 00:13:03,720
a look at some of the things that I've

334
00:13:03,720 --> 00:13:05,490
learned so one of the opportunities that

335
00:13:05,490 --> 00:13:08,069
I've really learned from this from

336
00:13:08,069 --> 00:13:10,470
firefighting is how important patience

337
00:13:10,470 --> 00:13:15,050
is take a beat and by that I mean stop

338
00:13:15,050 --> 00:13:19,439
take a breath because sometimes it's not

339
00:13:19,439 --> 00:13:19,750
an

340
00:13:19,750 --> 00:13:22,690
incident and even with a fire situation

341
00:13:22,690 --> 00:13:25,030
which you'd think would be absolutely

342
00:13:25,030 --> 00:13:26,890
life and death and you should be going

343
00:13:26,890 --> 00:13:29,860
running straight in the reality is that

344
00:13:29,860 --> 00:13:33,490
that breath that moment could make the

345
00:13:33,490 --> 00:13:35,470
difference between literally life or

346
00:13:35,470 --> 00:13:39,190
death or even in an incident response in

347
00:13:39,190 --> 00:13:40,410
the computer science side of things

348
00:13:40,410 --> 00:13:43,440
could be successful or not successful

349
00:13:43,440 --> 00:13:46,660
what I like to say here is slow is fast

350
00:13:46,660 --> 00:13:48,940
and what I mean by that is be very

351
00:13:48,940 --> 00:13:51,910
deliberate in what you do so here's a

352
00:13:51,910 --> 00:13:54,010
great example so the picture I showed

353
00:13:54,010 --> 00:13:55,480
you in the very beginning of me with the

354
00:13:55,480 --> 00:13:58,000
camera was when we first showed up at

355
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:00,430
this house on the left side of the

356
00:14:00,430 --> 00:14:02,350
screen you will see there's a lot of

357
00:14:02,350 --> 00:14:03,880
smoke coming out of this house

358
00:14:03,880 --> 00:14:05,830
you can start to see little tiny bits of

359
00:14:05,830 --> 00:14:08,380
fire if you look around at this on the

360
00:14:08,380 --> 00:14:09,790
right side of the screen you will see

361
00:14:09,790 --> 00:14:11,830
flames shooting out of the side of this

362
00:14:11,830 --> 00:14:15,520
house so what happened between these two

363
00:14:15,520 --> 00:14:17,500
pictures well I can tell you what

364
00:14:17,500 --> 00:14:20,260
happened what happened was our guys did

365
00:14:20,260 --> 00:14:22,150
not get up inside and start knocking

366
00:14:22,150 --> 00:14:24,820
down the roof that's the reality I mean

367
00:14:24,820 --> 00:14:26,950
some guys did go in we had a bunch of

368
00:14:26,950 --> 00:14:28,780
water problems and we didn't open up the

369
00:14:28,780 --> 00:14:30,580
roof they knew right where the fire was

370
00:14:30,580 --> 00:14:32,710
they didn't get it opened up and as a

371
00:14:32,710 --> 00:14:35,050
result we were there for four hours and

372
00:14:35,050 --> 00:14:37,660
it wasn't anybody one person's fault it

373
00:14:37,660 --> 00:14:40,120
was just the nature of things we didn't

374
00:14:40,120 --> 00:14:43,690
take a beat and go this is what we need

375
00:14:43,690 --> 00:14:46,810
to focus on bring in lots of tools do

376
00:14:46,810 --> 00:14:48,180
what we had to do and put the fire out

377
00:14:48,180 --> 00:14:51,310
because we got so hyper-focused on that

378
00:14:51,310 --> 00:14:53,110
little fire that you start to see coming

379
00:14:53,110 --> 00:14:55,510
out on the right side that you wind up

380
00:14:55,510 --> 00:14:58,360
with it blowing out of the roof so this

381
00:14:58,360 --> 00:15:00,670
is what I mean by patience now in an IR

382
00:15:00,670 --> 00:15:03,280
response the response this is what I'm

383
00:15:03,280 --> 00:15:06,730
talking about so you get boss people who

384
00:15:06,730 --> 00:15:09,430
are freaking out oh my god it's the end

385
00:15:09,430 --> 00:15:11,620
of the world what are we gonna do and I

386
00:15:11,620 --> 00:15:13,480
bring up Chegg as a great example of

387
00:15:13,480 --> 00:15:13,930
this

388
00:15:13,930 --> 00:15:16,839
so cheque is a company that among other

389
00:15:16,839 --> 00:15:21,190
things does educational book lending or

390
00:15:21,190 --> 00:15:24,010
book renting and when they do textbook

391
00:15:24,010 --> 00:15:25,900
rentals they have a log in and that log

392
00:15:25,900 --> 00:15:27,970
in unfortunately is sometimes the same

393
00:15:27,970 --> 00:15:30,250
login is oh I don't know the educational

394
00:15:30,250 --> 00:15:33,220
institution so when forty million of

395
00:15:33,220 --> 00:15:34,720
their customers were breached in

396
00:15:34,720 --> 00:15:38,259
nineteen in 2019 you might expect there

397
00:15:38,259 --> 00:15:41,019
were a few compromised accounts right so

398
00:15:41,019 --> 00:15:43,930
this has brought to higher ed

399
00:15:43,930 --> 00:15:46,600
institutions everywhere and places had

400
00:15:46,600 --> 00:15:48,250
lots and lots and lots of accounts that

401
00:15:48,250 --> 00:15:50,079
were given to them and lots of boss

402
00:15:50,079 --> 00:15:52,420
people lost their minds because they

403
00:15:52,420 --> 00:15:53,970
thought oh no it's the end of the world

404
00:15:53,970 --> 00:15:57,519
wait a minute is it an incident is it

405
00:15:57,519 --> 00:16:00,430
really truly an incident in that context

406
00:16:00,430 --> 00:16:02,829
and the reality is well it's a bunch of

407
00:16:02,829 --> 00:16:05,439
compromised accounts but that compromise

408
00:16:05,439 --> 00:16:08,040
didn't start in your organization you

409
00:16:08,040 --> 00:16:10,689
aren't responsible for that yes you have

410
00:16:10,689 --> 00:16:12,009
to deal with the compromised accounts

411
00:16:12,009 --> 00:16:15,370
but is this really that serious the same

412
00:16:15,370 --> 00:16:17,769
really goes for you know any other

413
00:16:17,769 --> 00:16:19,629
incident I have friends that work in IR

414
00:16:19,629 --> 00:16:22,120
in law enforcement time is certainly of

415
00:16:22,120 --> 00:16:25,420
the essence but is it at the at the

416
00:16:25,420 --> 00:16:27,040
level of life safety can you take that

417
00:16:27,040 --> 00:16:29,199
beat and as you saw even with the fire

418
00:16:29,199 --> 00:16:31,389
service taking that beat could make

419
00:16:31,389 --> 00:16:34,689
things more successful take a second and

420
00:16:34,689 --> 00:16:36,639
think about what the real risk that

421
00:16:36,639 --> 00:16:41,230
you're facing is so a challenge one of

422
00:16:41,230 --> 00:16:42,790
the things that I've learned from the

423
00:16:42,790 --> 00:16:44,769
fire services you get very stuck on

424
00:16:44,769 --> 00:16:47,319
tunnel vision it's very easy to get

425
00:16:47,319 --> 00:16:49,300
focused on one thing in particular and

426
00:16:49,300 --> 00:16:52,930
sort of lose the rest of what you're

427
00:16:52,930 --> 00:16:55,540
trying to do so

428
00:16:55,540 --> 00:16:57,970
you don't see that bigger picture here's

429
00:16:57,970 --> 00:16:59,769
a great example of tunnel vision in the

430
00:16:59,769 --> 00:17:00,459
fire service

431
00:17:00,459 --> 00:17:03,129
what are those combs protecting it's

432
00:17:03,129 --> 00:17:07,750
really hard to tell but what those cones

433
00:17:07,750 --> 00:17:09,130
are actually protecting or we're

434
00:17:09,130 --> 00:17:11,619
protecting right just a few seconds

435
00:17:11,619 --> 00:17:14,140
after this or until excuse me a few

436
00:17:14,140 --> 00:17:16,839
seconds after this with a live wire as

437
00:17:16,839 --> 00:17:20,069
an electrical wire that had fallen down

438
00:17:20,069 --> 00:17:22,809
now when we showed up on the scene and

439
00:17:22,809 --> 00:17:24,280
those cones were there but we didn't

440
00:17:24,280 --> 00:17:26,439
know what they were how hard would it be

441
00:17:26,439 --> 00:17:28,299
to just go running in that front door

442
00:17:28,299 --> 00:17:31,330
trying to put that fire out you get so

443
00:17:31,330 --> 00:17:33,429
focused on what you're doing that you

444
00:17:33,429 --> 00:17:36,480
miss something that could be dangerous

445
00:17:36,480 --> 00:17:40,030
not unlike in Incident Response is the

446
00:17:40,030 --> 00:17:42,700
scene in fact safe yes and in many cases

447
00:17:42,700 --> 00:17:45,280
you know you're doing you're dealing

448
00:17:45,280 --> 00:17:47,020
with malware you're doing dealing with

449
00:17:47,020 --> 00:17:48,340
compromise but if you're in law

450
00:17:48,340 --> 00:17:50,710
enforcement or if your equipment is in a

451
00:17:50,710 --> 00:17:52,210
place that could be unsafe

452
00:17:52,210 --> 00:17:54,070
I give that Express this example in the

453
00:17:54,070 --> 00:17:57,340
bottom you know when you're going and

454
00:17:57,340 --> 00:18:00,190
you're looking at this incident are you

455
00:18:00,190 --> 00:18:01,690
making assumptions that it's malware

456
00:18:01,690 --> 00:18:04,140
could it just be a Mis configuration

457
00:18:04,140 --> 00:18:06,760
certainly you don't ever want to go into

458
00:18:06,760 --> 00:18:08,290
a forensic situation where you're doing

459
00:18:08,290 --> 00:18:09,940
blind hardware acquisition because

460
00:18:09,940 --> 00:18:12,040
you're so focused on on grabbing that

461
00:18:12,040 --> 00:18:12,640
hardware

462
00:18:12,640 --> 00:18:14,830
maybe it's encrypted and if you just

463
00:18:14,830 --> 00:18:16,540
shut it off now you've lost all that

464
00:18:16,540 --> 00:18:18,700
information another example would be

465
00:18:18,700 --> 00:18:22,360
something like an email that looks like

466
00:18:22,360 --> 00:18:24,010
it's something similar or a ransomware

467
00:18:24,010 --> 00:18:26,230
situation but maybe it's just a phishing

468
00:18:26,230 --> 00:18:28,180
message maybe it's just intended to get

469
00:18:28,180 --> 00:18:30,730
credentials so it's really important to

470
00:18:30,730 --> 00:18:33,580
take a moment and look at those things

471
00:18:33,580 --> 00:18:36,310
and not get tunnel vision so the last

472
00:18:36,310 --> 00:18:37,830
thing that I'll bring up here is

473
00:18:37,830 --> 00:18:41,020
accountability which doesn't necessarily

474
00:18:41,020 --> 00:18:43,450
seem like it fits Incident Response but

475
00:18:43,450 --> 00:18:45,820
it it really does and and again anybody

476
00:18:45,820 --> 00:18:47,110
who's done anything with law enforcement

477
00:18:47,110 --> 00:18:49,060
is probably a little more familiar with

478
00:18:49,060 --> 00:18:51,130
this but it really should be true in any

479
00:18:51,130 --> 00:18:52,630
K time you're doing Incident Response

480
00:18:52,630 --> 00:18:55,600
especially any sort of sensitive

481
00:18:55,600 --> 00:18:57,880
forensics case you need to know where

482
00:18:57,880 --> 00:19:00,430
everybody is and not just because you

483
00:19:00,430 --> 00:19:02,170
want to know where they are but there

484
00:19:02,170 --> 00:19:04,000
could be duplication of effort somebody

485
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:05,490
could be stepping on each other's toes

486
00:19:05,490 --> 00:19:08,260
literally figuratively that could be

487
00:19:08,260 --> 00:19:10,690
really serious so in the fire service we

488
00:19:10,690 --> 00:19:12,640
have what are called accountability tags

489
00:19:12,640 --> 00:19:14,200
which is what you're seeing on the Left

490
00:19:14,200 --> 00:19:17,230
we keep one of those on our helmets and

491
00:19:17,230 --> 00:19:19,450
another one usually hanging off some

492
00:19:19,450 --> 00:19:21,040
other part of our gear when we get on

493
00:19:21,040 --> 00:19:23,740
our fire trucks we hang that tag on the

494
00:19:23,740 --> 00:19:26,260
truck if we are going inside we have a

495
00:19:26,260 --> 00:19:28,300
second tag that we drop at the door and

496
00:19:28,300 --> 00:19:30,910
that tells us where we physically are on

497
00:19:30,910 --> 00:19:33,340
the right you see swipe card access so

498
00:19:33,340 --> 00:19:35,860
your Incident Response you might be

499
00:19:35,860 --> 00:19:37,870
logging physically with a log like what

500
00:19:37,870 --> 00:19:40,030
you're seeing there you might be logging

501
00:19:40,030 --> 00:19:42,250
in and out your swipe card access logs

502
00:19:42,250 --> 00:19:43,810
might provide some accountability

503
00:19:43,810 --> 00:19:49,240
information so what I didn't have a

504
00:19:49,240 --> 00:19:51,820
chance to really talk about specifically

505
00:19:51,820 --> 00:19:54,460
is the incident command system and I

506
00:19:54,460 --> 00:19:56,560
will get back to that in a second but in

507
00:19:56,560 --> 00:19:59,160
general think like a firefighter have

508
00:19:59,160 --> 00:20:01,350
patience take that beat before you

509
00:20:01,350 --> 00:20:04,650
continue avoid tunnel vision do what we

510
00:20:04,650 --> 00:20:06,990
call a 360 when you first pull up on the

511
00:20:06,990 --> 00:20:08,640
scene of a fire the idea is that you're

512
00:20:08,640 --> 00:20:11,610
supposed to pull just past the structure

513
00:20:11,610 --> 00:20:13,500
that is on fire because you want to see

514
00:20:13,500 --> 00:20:15,390
at least three sides and then once you

515
00:20:15,390 --> 00:20:18,390
are at the scene the incident commander

516
00:20:18,390 --> 00:20:20,190
does a 360 going all the way around the

517
00:20:20,190 --> 00:20:21,390
building because you never know what's

518
00:20:21,390 --> 00:20:22,910
behind you

519
00:20:22,910 --> 00:20:26,100
location document where people are know

520
00:20:26,100 --> 00:20:28,590
where your team is it'll prevent a lot

521
00:20:28,590 --> 00:20:30,690
of headaches in the end and back to the

522
00:20:30,690 --> 00:20:32,910
incident command system the reason I

523
00:20:32,910 --> 00:20:34,470
bring this up is that I think we could

524
00:20:34,470 --> 00:20:37,350
learn a lot from the way that this is

525
00:20:37,350 --> 00:20:39,690
organized because there is a structure

526
00:20:39,690 --> 00:20:41,640
of command here and there is a way to

527
00:20:41,640 --> 00:20:43,710
bring in other organizations without it

528
00:20:43,710 --> 00:20:45,720
being chaos and I know when I've done

529
00:20:45,720 --> 00:20:48,990
incidents before and your local team is

530
00:20:48,990 --> 00:20:50,580
doing some incident response and law

531
00:20:50,580 --> 00:20:51,900
enforcement gets involved and all these

532
00:20:51,900 --> 00:20:53,820
other groups get involved it can be very

533
00:20:53,820 --> 00:20:57,360
difficult to organize so some final

534
00:20:57,360 --> 00:21:00,600
thoughts this is going to seem very

535
00:21:00,600 --> 00:21:02,160
strange to those of you who've never

536
00:21:02,160 --> 00:21:04,500
been in the fire service and maybe pull

537
00:21:04,500 --> 00:21:06,230
you a little out of your comfort zone

538
00:21:06,230 --> 00:21:10,380
but as this says here I would say great

539
00:21:10,380 --> 00:21:13,710
things don't come from comfort zones so

540
00:21:13,710 --> 00:21:14,970
push yourself a little out of the

541
00:21:14,970 --> 00:21:16,680
comfort zone and see what you can learn

542
00:21:16,680 --> 00:21:21,110
from a firefighter thank you

543
00:21:30,770 --> 00:21:35,840
that an ELISA to join in on the Q&A so

544
00:21:35,840 --> 00:21:38,120
ELISA welcome and machiya the channel

545
00:21:38,120 --> 00:21:39,560
and what questions do you have for Kathy

546
00:21:39,560 --> 00:21:40,670
today yes

547
00:21:40,670 --> 00:21:43,220
so I appreciate it and Kathy well done

548
00:21:43,220 --> 00:21:45,230
first of all oh yeah

549
00:21:45,230 --> 00:21:46,820
Huffman we're trying to scramble through

550
00:21:46,820 --> 00:21:50,750
some last-minute technical difficulties

551
00:21:50,750 --> 00:21:53,300
but we got you here so one of the

552
00:21:53,300 --> 00:21:55,460
questions that was asked was you brought

553
00:21:55,460 --> 00:21:59,180
up the idea or kind of the I guess the

554
00:21:59,180 --> 00:22:02,390
metaphor of volunteer firefighters right

555
00:22:02,390 --> 00:22:05,450
is there is there an equivalent can

556
00:22:05,450 --> 00:22:07,580
there be an equivalent within our

557
00:22:07,580 --> 00:22:09,500
organizations because you also mentioned

558
00:22:09,500 --> 00:22:12,680
accountability but can we draw instant

559
00:22:12,680 --> 00:22:14,330
responders from other areas of the

560
00:22:14,330 --> 00:22:17,810
business I think so I mean I think that

561
00:22:17,810 --> 00:22:20,180
there are certain certain technical

562
00:22:20,180 --> 00:22:22,250
levels that you are only going to have

563
00:22:22,250 --> 00:22:24,050
perhaps in your organization in certain

564
00:22:24,050 --> 00:22:27,530
places but you absolutely can have

565
00:22:27,530 --> 00:22:30,340
people in your organization who are

566
00:22:30,340 --> 00:22:33,350
advocates as you always refer to

567
00:22:33,350 --> 00:22:35,990
yourself security advocates within other

568
00:22:35,990 --> 00:22:38,450
portions of the company who understand

569
00:22:38,450 --> 00:22:40,010
how some of these things work and

570
00:22:40,010 --> 00:22:42,050
ideally if you have an incident response

571
00:22:42,050 --> 00:22:45,560
team and those people are from various

572
00:22:45,560 --> 00:22:47,510
areas of the company that's certainly

573
00:22:47,510 --> 00:22:49,580
very similar to what we're talking about

574
00:22:49,580 --> 00:22:52,460
right so they may not be volunteers in

575
00:22:52,460 --> 00:22:53,780
sort of the traditional sense but

576
00:22:53,780 --> 00:22:56,420
ideally in a large incident you're going

577
00:22:56,420 --> 00:22:58,190
to be involving people from finance and

578
00:22:58,190 --> 00:23:03,200
HR and perhaps communications so I would

579
00:23:03,200 --> 00:23:05,440
say that's probably a good equivalent

580
00:23:05,440 --> 00:23:09,790
okay another question

581
00:23:09,790 --> 00:23:13,190
so you mentioned slowing down you know

582
00:23:13,190 --> 00:23:16,220
and taking that deep breath and I've

583
00:23:16,220 --> 00:23:18,500
also also often heard that referred to

584
00:23:18,500 --> 00:23:23,420
as don't create patient - is that I mean

585
00:23:23,420 --> 00:23:25,510
is there a danger there as well besides

586
00:23:25,510 --> 00:23:28,250
not just missing something that you kind

587
00:23:28,250 --> 00:23:30,050
of run past but is there actually danger

588
00:23:30,050 --> 00:23:31,430
that you could do damage to your

589
00:23:31,430 --> 00:23:34,970
responders if they don't take that and

590
00:23:34,970 --> 00:23:36,260
I'm talking in the incident response

591
00:23:36,260 --> 00:23:39,410
sense sure well I mean it depends

592
00:23:39,410 --> 00:23:41,150
greatly on the particular incident right

593
00:23:41,150 --> 00:23:44,359
so if you are responding to an incident

594
00:23:44,359 --> 00:23:46,639
in a physical situation that has some

595
00:23:46,639 --> 00:23:49,549
sort of damage damaging characteristics

596
00:23:49,549 --> 00:23:51,289
so you go running into a server room

597
00:23:51,289 --> 00:23:53,119
that you know has maybe been blocked off

598
00:23:53,119 --> 00:23:56,419
because there's wires down or maybe

599
00:23:56,419 --> 00:23:57,950
there's been a fire in the server room

600
00:23:57,950 --> 00:24:00,739
and the the old Halon system went off

601
00:24:00,739 --> 00:24:03,440
and it's a mess or you've had water

602
00:24:03,440 --> 00:24:05,929
dripping from the ceiling I mean there

603
00:24:05,929 --> 00:24:07,639
could be a million things that you're

604
00:24:07,639 --> 00:24:10,279
responding to within an incident that

605
00:24:10,279 --> 00:24:14,779
are physical you know dangers you also

606
00:24:14,779 --> 00:24:17,599
put your your folks in sort of an

607
00:24:17,599 --> 00:24:21,289
emotional risk if they are unprepared

608
00:24:21,289 --> 00:24:23,929
for maybe what they're going to see so

609
00:24:23,929 --> 00:24:26,299
depending on what kind of incident

610
00:24:26,299 --> 00:24:29,209
you're running into you know if you have

611
00:24:29,209 --> 00:24:31,429
a situation where you have an incident

612
00:24:31,429 --> 00:24:34,609
where a system has been inundated with

613
00:24:34,609 --> 00:24:36,589
malware that maybe involves child porn

614
00:24:36,589 --> 00:24:38,239
that could be horrible absolutely

615
00:24:38,239 --> 00:24:39,739
horrible and you don't know what you're

616
00:24:39,739 --> 00:24:43,849
gonna run into okay well awesome well I

617
00:24:43,849 --> 00:24:45,289
