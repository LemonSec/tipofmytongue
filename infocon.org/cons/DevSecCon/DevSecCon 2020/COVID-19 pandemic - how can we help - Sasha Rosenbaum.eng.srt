1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:04,429
I hope y'all can see me alright

2
00:00:08,660 --> 00:00:11,940
unfortunately I can't see anyone so I'm

3
00:00:11,940 --> 00:00:13,910
gonna hope that it all works

4
00:00:13,910 --> 00:00:16,859
alright some folks don't mean to say

5
00:00:16,859 --> 00:00:19,710
that's work so hopefully it's all good

6
00:00:19,710 --> 00:00:23,609
umm so I'm gonna surprisingly not be

7
00:00:23,609 --> 00:00:25,830
talking about technology today I'm going

8
00:00:25,830 --> 00:00:28,140
to be talking about how we can help with

9
00:00:28,140 --> 00:00:31,560
the covered 19 pandemic and what we

10
00:00:31,560 --> 00:00:34,860
could potentially do to help everybody

11
00:00:34,860 --> 00:00:38,940
who is facing issues right now I'm and I

12
00:00:38,940 --> 00:00:42,329
think this talk might be shorter than 30

13
00:00:42,329 --> 00:00:44,670
minutes but my goal here isn't to

14
00:00:44,670 --> 00:00:47,430
overload you with information it's to

15
00:00:47,430 --> 00:00:50,250
give you some ideas of what you could

16
00:00:50,250 --> 00:00:53,870
potentially do to make things better so

17
00:00:53,870 --> 00:00:57,360
I'm gonna get started by introducing

18
00:00:57,360 --> 00:01:00,870
myself so my name is Sasha Rosenbaum I'm

19
00:01:00,870 --> 00:01:04,019
a product manager at github I'm on

20
00:01:04,019 --> 00:01:06,950
Twitter as divine ops so feel free to

21
00:01:06,950 --> 00:01:10,439
give me feedback there as well I'm I've

22
00:01:10,439 --> 00:01:12,780
been using this picture for a while too

23
00:01:12,780 --> 00:01:15,509
in my sort of introduction slide and I

24
00:01:15,509 --> 00:01:17,880
considered changing it for a less happy

25
00:01:17,880 --> 00:01:21,049
picture um but I think it's important to

26
00:01:21,049 --> 00:01:24,540
sort of still have happy moments and

27
00:01:24,540 --> 00:01:26,790
this picture of by the way is from Dell

28
00:01:26,790 --> 00:01:30,509
obsession goggle which is going to

29
00:01:30,509 --> 00:01:34,500
happen on September 1st and 2nd whether

30
00:01:34,500 --> 00:01:37,200
it's live or virtual we don't know but

31
00:01:37,200 --> 00:01:41,280
it's going to UM happen so you can all

32
00:01:41,280 --> 00:01:46,759
join us there as well so I am NOT an

33
00:01:46,759 --> 00:01:49,829
epidemiologist or economists or a doctor

34
00:01:49,829 --> 00:01:53,220
or any type of person that you typically

35
00:01:53,220 --> 00:01:56,340
see on the you know pandemic response

36
00:01:56,340 --> 00:02:00,659
teams right I'm so what gives me

37
00:02:00,659 --> 00:02:03,030
credibility to talk to you today I guess

38
00:02:03,030 --> 00:02:05,579
is the biggest thing that I'm a human

39
00:02:05,579 --> 00:02:10,169
and I care and I think that's why we're

40
00:02:10,169 --> 00:02:12,629
having this conference which is hosted

41
00:02:12,629 --> 00:02:13,660
by snick

42
00:02:13,660 --> 00:02:16,870
community members um who want to

43
00:02:16,870 --> 00:02:19,450
contribute to the response to this

44
00:02:19,450 --> 00:02:23,380
pandemic to the efforts and just want to

45
00:02:23,380 --> 00:02:25,540
raise money or maybe just collaborate

46
00:02:25,540 --> 00:02:29,920
and um you know have helped other people

47
00:02:29,920 --> 00:02:32,710
in this tough situation that we're all

48
00:02:32,710 --> 00:02:37,030
in right now so to get us started I want

49
00:02:37,030 --> 00:02:39,640
to sort of talk a little bit about on

50
00:02:39,640 --> 00:02:43,510
what the pandemic is so we're just gonna

51
00:02:43,510 --> 00:02:46,540
look at data that again I think you

52
00:02:46,540 --> 00:02:50,260
probably have all seen before um but it

53
00:02:50,260 --> 00:02:52,660
might be sort of a useful refresher for

54
00:02:52,660 --> 00:02:54,130
some folks who might have missed some

55
00:02:54,130 --> 00:02:57,490
news or just a kind of a level setter

56
00:02:57,490 --> 00:03:02,710
for us so this is a map from the World

57
00:03:02,710 --> 00:03:05,170
Health Organization website I'm on a

58
00:03:05,170 --> 00:03:07,630
current situation and this is from

59
00:03:07,630 --> 00:03:09,970
yesterday so this data may have changed

60
00:03:09,970 --> 00:03:13,390
a little bit um but we have close to 2

61
00:03:13,390 --> 00:03:16,000
million confirmed cases and we have over

62
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:18,880
a hundred thousand deaths from the virus

63
00:03:18,880 --> 00:03:23,260
so basically we're in a very very bad

64
00:03:23,260 --> 00:03:25,840
global crisis right now and this is

65
00:03:25,840 --> 00:03:27,910
their first pandemic such as this one

66
00:03:27,910 --> 00:03:30,400
I'm in the last hundred years since the

67
00:03:30,400 --> 00:03:31,450
Spanish flu

68
00:03:31,450 --> 00:03:34,840
so basically we're facing a crisis that

69
00:03:34,840 --> 00:03:37,240
none of us probably have experienced in

70
00:03:37,240 --> 00:03:42,100
our lifetime um and one of the questions

71
00:03:42,100 --> 00:03:45,220
that I had in the beginning and that I

72
00:03:45,220 --> 00:03:46,959
heard from a lot of people is that

73
00:03:46,959 --> 00:03:49,930
what's different about this right we

74
00:03:49,930 --> 00:03:53,770
have flu every year and it kills many

75
00:03:53,770 --> 00:03:56,890
people and it also spreads globally you

76
00:03:56,890 --> 00:04:00,010
know and we have different versions of

77
00:04:00,010 --> 00:04:02,739
flu coming out and so basically in

78
00:04:02,739 --> 00:04:04,660
different strains so basically what's

79
00:04:04,660 --> 00:04:07,180
the difference so some of this data is

80
00:04:07,180 --> 00:04:09,190
still in research so we don't actually

81
00:04:09,190 --> 00:04:13,120
know some of these numbers on but first

82
00:04:13,120 --> 00:04:15,640
of all we talked about how you know

83
00:04:15,640 --> 00:04:17,738
potentially the number of infected

84
00:04:17,738 --> 00:04:21,970
people from haben 19 is higher I'm also

85
00:04:21,970 --> 00:04:25,120
that the fatality rate might be higher

86
00:04:25,120 --> 00:04:27,160
but again this is something that

87
00:04:27,160 --> 00:04:30,280
we potentially don't know because we

88
00:04:30,280 --> 00:04:32,110
might not be aware of all the cases of

89
00:04:32,110 --> 00:04:33,760
all the people who've been infected so

90
00:04:33,760 --> 00:04:35,440
that would affect the number for the

91
00:04:35,440 --> 00:04:38,230
total mortality rate I'm I think that

92
00:04:38,230 --> 00:04:43,000
one of the biggest numbers out here is

93
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:48,430
the 1 to 14 days incubation time so

94
00:04:48,430 --> 00:04:50,740
typically the flu has a much shorter

95
00:04:50,740 --> 00:04:52,690
incubation time so people are not

96
00:04:52,690 --> 00:04:54,670
contagious for an extended period of

97
00:04:54,670 --> 00:04:54,970
time

98
00:04:54,970 --> 00:05:01,390
whereas in the in the case of carbon 19

99
00:05:01,390 --> 00:05:04,000
people can be contagious for about 14

100
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:06,760
days without having any symptoms so

101
00:05:06,760 --> 00:05:09,700
that's a major problem when people get

102
00:05:09,700 --> 00:05:13,390
infected I'm and also some cases it's

103
00:05:13,390 --> 00:05:15,130
been reported that people don't

104
00:05:15,130 --> 00:05:17,580
experience sense of symptoms at all I'm

105
00:05:17,580 --> 00:05:20,230
so we might not even know that we're

106
00:05:20,230 --> 00:05:21,880
carrying and spreading the virus

107
00:05:21,880 --> 00:05:25,960
um and so basically we we are facing

108
00:05:25,960 --> 00:05:28,840
this highly spreading pandemic and the

109
00:05:28,840 --> 00:05:31,030
biggest thing that's the difference here

110
00:05:31,030 --> 00:05:33,190
is that none of us has immunity to this

111
00:05:33,190 --> 00:05:35,440
but as if we've never encountered this

112
00:05:35,440 --> 00:05:38,170
so in theory almost every one of us can

113
00:05:38,170 --> 00:05:40,630
contract this at this time and we have

114
00:05:40,630 --> 00:05:43,300
no vaccine and we have no or no medical

115
00:05:43,300 --> 00:05:47,169
treatment for this I'm and I think for a

116
00:05:47,169 --> 00:05:50,500
while there everybody was talking about

117
00:05:50,500 --> 00:05:53,169
how we were gonna you know develop her

118
00:05:53,169 --> 00:05:55,600
an immunity and everything is going to

119
00:05:55,600 --> 00:05:58,030
be okay we're just gonna sort of carry

120
00:05:58,030 --> 00:06:01,570
on but then like I think this was when

121
00:06:01,570 --> 00:06:04,050
the pivotal studies that came out on I

122
00:06:04,050 --> 00:06:11,110
believe March 16th and so basically this

123
00:06:11,110 --> 00:06:13,870
was a study from Imperial College and UK

124
00:06:13,870 --> 00:06:17,020
that modeled what different responses to

125
00:06:17,020 --> 00:06:20,230
this pandemic are going to cause and so

126
00:06:20,230 --> 00:06:23,190
we can see that the the black line is a

127
00:06:23,190 --> 00:06:26,230
significant surge is if we don't do

128
00:06:26,230 --> 00:06:30,600
anything to to address the pandemic the

129
00:06:30,600 --> 00:06:33,790
then we would overload so the number is

130
00:06:33,790 --> 00:06:37,450
30 times greater demand for ICU beds

131
00:06:37,450 --> 00:06:40,120
than capacity right which means that a

132
00:06:40,120 --> 00:06:41,020
lot more people

133
00:06:41,020 --> 00:06:43,599
died and a lot more health professionals

134
00:06:43,599 --> 00:06:46,629
get completely overloaded with this and

135
00:06:46,629 --> 00:06:49,900
then on there's a whole different models

136
00:06:49,900 --> 00:06:53,349
of different responses that we could

137
00:06:53,349 --> 00:06:55,479
have and mrs. mode this was modeled for

138
00:06:55,479 --> 00:06:58,449
UK in the u.s. in terms of response and

139
00:06:58,449 --> 00:07:02,139
both of them basically the only viable

140
00:07:02,139 --> 00:07:05,800
option was shown to be home quarantine

141
00:07:05,800 --> 00:07:08,889
and social distancing and basically most

142
00:07:08,889 --> 00:07:11,740
people staying offline I'm still okay

143
00:07:11,740 --> 00:07:17,020
and all the okay I think I'm okay on

144
00:07:17,020 --> 00:07:19,599
presentation so hopefully if not then

145
00:07:19,599 --> 00:07:24,039
people will let me know um so that's why

146
00:07:24,039 --> 00:07:26,289
people talk about flattening the curve

147
00:07:26,289 --> 00:07:28,960
right so if we embrace social distancing

148
00:07:28,960 --> 00:07:31,780
we fled in that curve which means not

149
00:07:31,780 --> 00:07:33,669
all infections come in at the same time

150
00:07:33,669 --> 00:07:36,250
which means that we don't overload our

151
00:07:36,250 --> 00:07:38,710
healthcare system which is also very

152
00:07:38,710 --> 00:07:43,780
important not just for on basically our

153
00:07:43,780 --> 00:07:46,419
response to this illness but also for

154
00:07:46,419 --> 00:07:48,819
other illnesses because we can be

155
00:07:48,819 --> 00:07:51,849
talking about I'm having you know

156
00:07:51,849 --> 00:07:53,979
someone having a car accident and if all

157
00:07:53,979 --> 00:07:56,860
the ICU beds are taken then there's no

158
00:07:56,860 --> 00:08:00,250
one to take care of them so we are

159
00:08:00,250 --> 00:08:02,020
social distancing right now in the

160
00:08:02,020 --> 00:08:04,270
social distancing in itself introduces

161
00:08:04,270 --> 00:08:06,639
some challenges right so basically I

162
00:08:06,639 --> 00:08:08,710
could talk for a year about this and

163
00:08:08,710 --> 00:08:10,569
this is part of it is already happening

164
00:08:10,569 --> 00:08:12,490
and part of it is projected but

165
00:08:12,490 --> 00:08:14,500
basically you were have we have people

166
00:08:14,500 --> 00:08:16,150
dying we have health care systems

167
00:08:16,150 --> 00:08:19,360
overloaded we have economic slowdown we

168
00:08:19,360 --> 00:08:21,279
have disruption of travel of course the

169
00:08:21,279 --> 00:08:24,880
u.s. borders hospitality industry lots

170
00:08:24,880 --> 00:08:27,310
of unemployment like of child care and

171
00:08:27,310 --> 00:08:28,840
school closure is it's very hard

172
00:08:28,840 --> 00:08:31,719
especially when we're talking about the

173
00:08:31,719 --> 00:08:33,969
fact that some people are essential

174
00:08:33,969 --> 00:08:37,149
workers and they can't get childcare so

175
00:08:37,149 --> 00:08:40,208
stuff like that and we also seen sort of

176
00:08:40,208 --> 00:08:42,610
Rises and a phobia and racism around the

177
00:08:42,610 --> 00:08:44,740
world because people are looking for

178
00:08:44,740 --> 00:08:47,800
someone to blame um and one other

179
00:08:47,800 --> 00:08:49,149
problem that I wanted to know is

180
00:08:49,149 --> 00:08:51,130
increase in domestic violence because

181
00:08:51,130 --> 00:08:53,020
there's lots of stressors in the

182
00:08:53,020 --> 00:08:54,730
pandemic and

183
00:08:54,730 --> 00:08:56,529
those people are in lockdown and it

184
00:08:56,529 --> 00:08:59,310
increases the cases and the response is

185
00:08:59,310 --> 00:09:01,959
limited at the moment so we have lots of

186
00:09:01,959 --> 00:09:05,350
problems I am noting also a potential

187
00:09:05,350 --> 00:09:07,990
positive so I you know we're seeing

188
00:09:07,990 --> 00:09:10,480
already like reduce air pollution so

189
00:09:10,480 --> 00:09:14,380
hopefully that kind of stays on and we

190
00:09:14,380 --> 00:09:16,630
don't you know start catching up and

191
00:09:16,630 --> 00:09:18,670
ramping up production so much that it

192
00:09:18,670 --> 00:09:20,949
all cancels out um we're seeing

193
00:09:20,949 --> 00:09:22,990
acceptance of remote work which I think

194
00:09:22,990 --> 00:09:25,029
enables a lot more people to participate

195
00:09:25,029 --> 00:09:27,459
in the economy that weren't able before

196
00:09:27,459 --> 00:09:30,010
I'm and we're seeing deregulation of

197
00:09:30,010 --> 00:09:31,690
certain services that previously

198
00:09:31,690 --> 00:09:34,660
required being on like on-site so that

199
00:09:34,660 --> 00:09:37,990
may be effective for like the long term

200
00:09:37,990 --> 00:09:39,730
because we've figured out how to give

201
00:09:39,730 --> 00:09:41,199
people health care or government

202
00:09:41,199 --> 00:09:44,230
services without them having to attend a

203
00:09:44,230 --> 00:09:46,510
certain facility I mean we're seeing a

204
00:09:46,510 --> 00:09:48,699
lot of response from people basically

205
00:09:48,699 --> 00:09:50,829
just coming together right and and so

206
00:09:50,829 --> 00:09:54,600
and talk about it later in the morning

207
00:09:54,600 --> 00:09:57,010
earlier in the morning about the fact

208
00:09:57,010 --> 00:10:00,069
that we are seeing this dramatic

209
00:10:00,069 --> 00:10:03,910
response and not being selfish about

210
00:10:03,910 --> 00:10:10,800
this so I want to play a video for y'all

211
00:10:13,360 --> 00:10:13,690
[Applause]

212
00:10:13,690 --> 00:10:17,870
[Music]

213
00:10:17,870 --> 00:10:22,320
heroes and heroes my motivation was just

214
00:10:22,320 --> 00:10:23,880
helping people someone that can't

215
00:10:23,880 --> 00:10:27,720
sacrifice his life to save someone's

216
00:10:27,720 --> 00:10:30,660
life I love my job

217
00:10:30,660 --> 00:10:33,209
my work we have Kovac patients -

218
00:10:33,209 --> 00:10:35,459
trickling in they saw this city that

219
00:10:35,459 --> 00:10:38,610
became silent and in these weeks it's so

220
00:10:38,610 --> 00:10:41,579
busy I think that I spot a trend we do

221
00:10:41,579 --> 00:10:46,589
not forgive ninety we measure to avoid

222
00:10:46,589 --> 00:10:49,769
the contact and unknown of a sudden I am

223
00:10:49,769 --> 00:10:53,570
infected the influence of patients and

224
00:10:53,570 --> 00:11:00,079
is really overwhelming to me I was

225
00:11:00,079 --> 00:11:05,250
waiting for my surgery words became call

226
00:11:05,250 --> 00:11:07,170
me the woods we have a clinic in the

227
00:11:07,170 --> 00:11:09,839
garage totally detached from the main

228
00:11:09,839 --> 00:11:12,180
hospitals one lesson for the mirrors

229
00:11:12,180 --> 00:11:14,720
let's just an asado or with this

230
00:11:14,720 --> 00:11:24,600
consider a video cameras informing us

231
00:11:24,600 --> 00:11:26,399
that they are slowly running out of

232
00:11:26,399 --> 00:11:29,730
chase kids working on making the videos

233
00:11:29,730 --> 00:11:31,889
for donning and doffing of PP how to

234
00:11:31,889 --> 00:11:34,010
wear a mask properly we still have a

235
00:11:34,010 --> 00:11:37,620
shortage of nurses if we can have enough

236
00:11:37,620 --> 00:11:40,620
staff and provide the right equipment

237
00:11:40,620 --> 00:11:43,589
you know I think it would be easier to

238
00:11:43,589 --> 00:11:46,769
care for the volume of patients take our

239
00:11:46,769 --> 00:11:48,750
own ideas into account and listen to us

240
00:11:48,750 --> 00:11:51,810
the care is stoner you can still say

241
00:11:51,810 --> 00:11:54,720
even this behind a mask to my colleague

242
00:11:54,720 --> 00:11:58,290
nurses I want to say you just inspired

243
00:11:58,290 --> 00:12:01,680
me yeah motivated because right now if

244
00:12:01,680 --> 00:12:03,690
we don't do it now I don't think that be

245
00:12:03,690 --> 00:12:06,089
another chance for us to do please stay

246
00:12:06,089 --> 00:12:08,790
home for us we've got this and we can do

247
00:12:08,790 --> 00:12:11,069
this it's the nursing with make such

248
00:12:11,069 --> 00:12:11,810
difference

249
00:12:11,810 --> 00:12:13,340
[Music]

250
00:12:13,340 --> 00:12:14,350
[Applause]

251
00:12:14,350 --> 00:12:18,899
[Music]

252
00:12:18,899 --> 00:12:23,529
so this was a video by WH oh the World

253
00:12:23,529 --> 00:12:26,890
Health Organization I mean so they are

254
00:12:26,890 --> 00:12:31,089
basically so they're basically doing

255
00:12:31,089 --> 00:12:33,880
this response and one of the main

256
00:12:33,880 --> 00:12:35,920
features of their response is helping

257
00:12:35,920 --> 00:12:37,540
health care professionals around the

258
00:12:37,540 --> 00:12:39,190
world and helping them wear protective

259
00:12:39,190 --> 00:12:42,579
equipment and other resources and so I

260
00:12:42,579 --> 00:12:45,490
think this is like a very very important

261
00:12:45,490 --> 00:12:47,320
effort because it helps people stay

262
00:12:47,320 --> 00:12:49,420
alive I'm both the health care

263
00:12:49,420 --> 00:12:51,010
professionals and the people who are

264
00:12:51,010 --> 00:12:53,950
sick and so it improves basically the

265
00:12:53,950 --> 00:12:57,850
situation for all of us so I want to I'm

266
00:12:57,850 --> 00:13:01,269
no switch Gary's into what you can

267
00:13:01,269 --> 00:13:02,800
actually do to help

268
00:13:02,800 --> 00:13:06,310
so I there's number of things that we

269
00:13:06,310 --> 00:13:10,149
can do and um let's get started by this

270
00:13:10,149 --> 00:13:13,899
one so like you should embrace taking

271
00:13:13,899 --> 00:13:15,730
care of yourself and if you have a

272
00:13:15,730 --> 00:13:18,459
family and pets and clothes you know

273
00:13:18,459 --> 00:13:20,800
friends who need help just taking care

274
00:13:20,800 --> 00:13:24,579
of them so it's actually is very very

275
00:13:24,579 --> 00:13:28,959
important and um self-care isn't selfish

276
00:13:28,959 --> 00:13:32,079
I and if all you can do right now is

277
00:13:32,079 --> 00:13:33,430
just take care of yourself make sure

278
00:13:33,430 --> 00:13:37,600
that your you know you properly um you

279
00:13:37,600 --> 00:13:40,060
know have the psychological care and the

280
00:13:40,060 --> 00:13:42,730
physical care that you need and taking

281
00:13:42,730 --> 00:13:45,310
care of you you know elderly relatives

282
00:13:45,310 --> 00:13:47,950
and children and stuff like that that is

283
00:13:47,950 --> 00:13:50,260
enough because you're part of humanity

284
00:13:50,260 --> 00:13:53,100
and you're helping the humanity by just

285
00:13:53,100 --> 00:13:55,810
basically taking care of you and your

286
00:13:55,810 --> 00:13:59,860
family um but then obviously we can

287
00:13:59,860 --> 00:14:03,760
embrace bigger things and I think every

288
00:14:03,760 --> 00:14:05,949
religion in the world has sort of some

289
00:14:05,949 --> 00:14:08,170
sort of saying that's similar to this

290
00:14:08,170 --> 00:14:10,089
one if you want to be happy practice

291
00:14:10,089 --> 00:14:13,360
compassion if I took this the full quote

292
00:14:13,360 --> 00:14:15,329
is if you want others to be happy

293
00:14:15,329 --> 00:14:18,250
practice compassion and if you want to

294
00:14:18,250 --> 00:14:20,560
be happy practice compassion and that's

295
00:14:20,560 --> 00:14:24,010
by Dalai Lama and I think we see a lot

296
00:14:24,010 --> 00:14:26,860
of times that when the circumstances are

297
00:14:26,860 --> 00:14:27,130
very

298
00:14:27,130 --> 00:14:30,820
bad we sort of closed up and we stopped

299
00:14:30,820 --> 00:14:32,560
paying attention to the world outside

300
00:14:32,560 --> 00:14:36,070
and we just basically focus on ourselves

301
00:14:36,070 --> 00:14:41,440
I had a fairly rough childhood and I

302
00:14:41,440 --> 00:14:44,440
remember my mom always saying hey we

303
00:14:44,440 --> 00:14:46,510
can't help other people we need help

304
00:14:46,510 --> 00:14:50,140
ourselves right and I it took me a few

305
00:14:50,140 --> 00:14:52,570
years but I found out that this wasn't

306
00:14:52,570 --> 00:14:55,180
true because when you help other people

307
00:14:55,180 --> 00:14:58,000
you kind of magically discover different

308
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:01,330
resources and you actually become

309
00:15:01,330 --> 00:15:04,090
happier and so there's actually lots of

310
00:15:04,090 --> 00:15:07,020
research on that I'm in terms of how

311
00:15:07,020 --> 00:15:10,570
helping others actually helps you so I

312
00:15:10,570 --> 00:15:13,180
also want to quote another like maybe a

313
00:15:13,180 --> 00:15:15,100
little more lighthearted quote but if

314
00:15:15,100 --> 00:15:16,630
you think you're too small to make a

315
00:15:16,630 --> 00:15:18,880
difference try sleeping with a mosquito

316
00:15:18,880 --> 00:15:22,600
and it's also bye-bye Dalai Lama but

317
00:15:22,600 --> 00:15:26,350
basically I have resourced slide in the

318
00:15:26,350 --> 00:15:29,560
end of this talk and there's some links

319
00:15:29,560 --> 00:15:32,500
on studies in terms of how volunteering

320
00:15:32,500 --> 00:15:36,090
and donating and giving in various ways

321
00:15:36,090 --> 00:15:38,590
basically just improves your health and

322
00:15:38,590 --> 00:15:40,600
it's like lowers your stress levels and

323
00:15:40,600 --> 00:15:42,100
blood pressure and stuff like that so

324
00:15:42,100 --> 00:15:45,430
even if you thought that you know you

325
00:15:45,430 --> 00:15:47,530
don't have the resources to help others

326
00:15:47,530 --> 00:15:50,890
that very help might be helping you as

327
00:15:50,890 --> 00:15:55,690
well and also it is nice and awesome to

328
00:15:55,690 --> 00:15:57,850
help others as well you know not just

329
00:15:57,850 --> 00:16:01,090
for yourself but yeah so you could

330
00:16:01,090 --> 00:16:05,620
donate money or time or resources and I

331
00:16:05,620 --> 00:16:07,750
think you know from the people who may

332
00:16:07,750 --> 00:16:10,180
be watching this video I think all of us

333
00:16:10,180 --> 00:16:13,750
have you know one or all three of these

334
00:16:13,750 --> 00:16:16,540
resources to donate and so we can always

335
00:16:16,540 --> 00:16:20,680
find some ways to give to give and

336
00:16:20,680 --> 00:16:23,410
donate to other people who have a harder

337
00:16:23,410 --> 00:16:24,940
situation than ourselves

338
00:16:24,940 --> 00:16:27,700
so I do have links at the end and I'm

339
00:16:27,700 --> 00:16:29,470
going to cover the things that you could

340
00:16:29,470 --> 00:16:32,920
be doing so you can volunteer in your

341
00:16:32,920 --> 00:16:35,560
community so communities right now need

342
00:16:35,560 --> 00:16:38,380
a lot of help so things like food banks

343
00:16:38,380 --> 00:16:40,690
and things like you know gross

344
00:16:40,690 --> 00:16:43,630
shopping for elderly neighbors I'm in

345
00:16:43,630 --> 00:16:47,070
volunteering at hospitals and you know

346
00:16:47,070 --> 00:16:50,080
volunteering on phone support lines for

347
00:16:50,080 --> 00:16:53,140
people in critical situations um blood

348
00:16:53,140 --> 00:16:55,450
banks need donations and stuff like that

349
00:16:55,450 --> 00:16:58,270
so we basically are talking about like

350
00:16:58,270 --> 00:17:00,460
lots because of social distancing and

351
00:17:00,460 --> 00:17:03,070
because of limited resources these

352
00:17:03,070 --> 00:17:04,689
organizations also have limited

353
00:17:04,689 --> 00:17:07,119
volunteers and so there's a lot of needs

354
00:17:07,119 --> 00:17:11,439
right now now I can't give you resources

355
00:17:11,439 --> 00:17:14,140
for your local volunteering options

356
00:17:14,140 --> 00:17:16,480
effectively I do have a link for

357
00:17:16,480 --> 00:17:19,599
volunteer match at the end for the US

358
00:17:19,599 --> 00:17:22,449
but basically just a simple search

359
00:17:22,449 --> 00:17:25,480
online search will give you tons of

360
00:17:25,480 --> 00:17:27,640
options on different things you could be

361
00:17:27,640 --> 00:17:29,650
doing for your community and that's a

362
00:17:29,650 --> 00:17:31,690
you know if you have time to volunteer

363
00:17:31,690 --> 00:17:34,030
that may be a good option and if you're

364
00:17:34,030 --> 00:17:36,010
not in the risk group and you can you

365
00:17:36,010 --> 00:17:39,720
know envision being around other people

366
00:17:39,720 --> 00:17:43,450
you can also volunteer online so I'm

367
00:17:43,450 --> 00:17:45,190
guessing most of us are technical

368
00:17:45,190 --> 00:17:47,740
professionals there's a lot of projects

369
00:17:47,740 --> 00:17:49,870
going on right now contributing to

370
00:17:49,870 --> 00:17:53,980
covered 19 efforts I'm so just to give

371
00:17:53,980 --> 00:17:55,720
you a couple of examples there's the

372
00:17:55,720 --> 00:17:58,390
like this is an open project for the

373
00:17:58,390 --> 00:18:02,170
global trend map the John Hopkins map is

374
00:18:02,170 --> 00:18:04,330
also not open project but there's also

375
00:18:04,330 --> 00:18:08,020
other things like the WTO is trying to

376
00:18:08,020 --> 00:18:11,020
develop a mobile application for that in

377
00:18:11,020 --> 00:18:13,420
there's self assessment trackers and

378
00:18:13,420 --> 00:18:15,970
lots of other things again I have a link

379
00:18:15,970 --> 00:18:21,130
at the end to some of the open source

380
00:18:21,130 --> 00:18:23,020
projects that we've been tracking at

381
00:18:23,020 --> 00:18:26,020
github that are basically focusing on

382
00:18:26,020 --> 00:18:28,870
the carbon 19 response so if you are at

383
00:18:28,870 --> 00:18:31,240
home and you're a technical professional

384
00:18:31,240 --> 00:18:32,920
and you can volunteer for one of these

385
00:18:32,920 --> 00:18:34,930
projects you are going to be making a

386
00:18:34,930 --> 00:18:35,710
difference here

387
00:18:35,710 --> 00:18:38,380
um there's another thing that you could

388
00:18:38,380 --> 00:18:40,990
do basically by clicking a button so

389
00:18:40,990 --> 00:18:43,870
folding at home uses people's personal

390
00:18:43,870 --> 00:18:46,180
computing resources when they're on idle

391
00:18:46,180 --> 00:18:50,440
I'm to do various projects various

392
00:18:50,440 --> 00:18:53,500
charity projects such as medical you

393
00:18:53,500 --> 00:18:54,140
know

394
00:18:54,140 --> 00:18:56,990
drug modeling and stuff like that they

395
00:18:56,990 --> 00:19:00,560
have a coffered 19 response track as

396
00:19:00,560 --> 00:19:03,050
well now so you can install it on your

397
00:19:03,050 --> 00:19:05,780
computers and basically be donating I

398
00:19:05,780 --> 00:19:08,000
should call the 19 response without

399
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:10,310
doing anything except for the 19 year

400
00:19:10,310 --> 00:19:14,390
CPU power you can donate obviously to

401
00:19:14,390 --> 00:19:17,600
charity focus on the Kovach 19 response

402
00:19:17,600 --> 00:19:20,870
this conference is donating to the World

403
00:19:20,870 --> 00:19:22,880
Health Organization which is

404
00:19:22,880 --> 00:19:25,580
contributing very very significantly to

405
00:19:25,580 --> 00:19:28,580
the world efforts to battle this

406
00:19:28,580 --> 00:19:33,260
emergency and I think I don't want to

407
00:19:33,260 --> 00:19:36,140
politicize things and lots of people are

408
00:19:36,140 --> 00:19:38,900
critical of every charity that we could

409
00:19:38,900 --> 00:19:43,070
think of but I think first of all we can

410
00:19:43,070 --> 00:19:45,680
see that you know just the levels of

411
00:19:45,680 --> 00:19:47,360
protective equipment that they shipped

412
00:19:47,360 --> 00:19:51,170
to various countries and especially to

413
00:19:51,170 --> 00:19:52,940
poor countries who can't afford this

414
00:19:52,940 --> 00:19:56,900
type of care is very major and also just

415
00:19:56,900 --> 00:19:58,910
coordinating response between countries

416
00:19:58,910 --> 00:20:02,300
like learning the things that are known

417
00:20:02,300 --> 00:20:04,430
already in China so they can help other

418
00:20:04,430 --> 00:20:06,350
countries that are facing that this

419
00:20:06,350 --> 00:20:08,300
emergency right now and things like that

420
00:20:08,300 --> 00:20:11,690
um if you don't like the World Health

421
00:20:11,690 --> 00:20:13,730
Organization there's other charities

422
00:20:13,730 --> 00:20:16,340
global and local so there's you know

423
00:20:16,340 --> 00:20:18,350
Doctors Without Borders and Red Cross

424
00:20:18,350 --> 00:20:21,140
and all sorts of things and again also

425
00:20:21,140 --> 00:20:23,330
local charities that are helping

426
00:20:23,330 --> 00:20:26,450
communities with this response um you

427
00:20:26,450 --> 00:20:28,970
have a donate button right here at the

428
00:20:28,970 --> 00:20:32,330
stream so you could obviously go and it

429
00:20:32,330 --> 00:20:34,490
shows up as a ticket but really this

430
00:20:34,490 --> 00:20:36,650
money is going towards the World Health

431
00:20:36,650 --> 00:20:40,310
Organization covered 19 response fund um

432
00:20:40,310 --> 00:20:42,620
and then you could donate to a charity

433
00:20:42,620 --> 00:20:46,100
that is not focused on covered 19 I know

434
00:20:46,100 --> 00:20:47,930
it may sound surprising but it's

435
00:20:47,930 --> 00:20:49,970
actually those charities are right now

436
00:20:49,970 --> 00:20:52,580
facing a very tough time finding

437
00:20:52,580 --> 00:20:55,490
donations because most of them get

438
00:20:55,490 --> 00:20:58,010
donations from fundraiser events so as

439
00:20:58,010 --> 00:20:59,690
an example of this from the gardening

440
00:20:59,690 --> 00:21:02,870
article there was a you know London

441
00:21:02,870 --> 00:21:05,450
Marathon that last year raised 66

442
00:21:05,450 --> 00:21:07,790
million pounds it's not happening

443
00:21:07,790 --> 00:21:11,260
years so obviously that's a problem for

444
00:21:11,260 --> 00:21:14,030
raising these donations and again most

445
00:21:14,030 --> 00:21:16,790
every charity I know has fundraisers

446
00:21:16,790 --> 00:21:19,010
that are now being canceled so if you

447
00:21:19,010 --> 00:21:21,230
have a favorite charity focusing on

448
00:21:21,230 --> 00:21:24,830
whatever it is education you know water

449
00:21:24,830 --> 00:21:26,780
supply around the world stuff like that

450
00:21:26,780 --> 00:21:29,030
you can obviously help them out by

451
00:21:29,030 --> 00:21:32,150
donating to them as well um and then if

452
00:21:32,150 --> 00:21:34,160
you were in a position to do this and I

453
00:21:34,160 --> 00:21:36,290
think most of us you know have some

454
00:21:36,290 --> 00:21:38,510
ability to influence our corporate

455
00:21:38,510 --> 00:21:41,270
leadership you can encourage the

456
00:21:41,270 --> 00:21:43,550
corporate support I am quite frankly

457
00:21:43,550 --> 00:21:45,880
humbled by the level of corporate

458
00:21:45,880 --> 00:21:49,150
contributions right now so for instance

459
00:21:49,150 --> 00:21:53,570
Microsoft on the March SiC makes much v

460
00:21:53,570 --> 00:21:55,850
announced that they will continue paying

461
00:21:55,850 --> 00:21:59,030
their vendors throughout this time even

462
00:21:59,030 --> 00:22:01,250
if the vendors are not clocking in hours

463
00:22:01,250 --> 00:22:05,150
so and then basic companies like Amazon

464
00:22:05,150 --> 00:22:07,370
Expedia Facebook Twitter Google and

465
00:22:07,370 --> 00:22:10,100
others followed suit as well so these

466
00:22:10,100 --> 00:22:11,630
people are getting paid and it's a

467
00:22:11,630 --> 00:22:14,660
choice by corporations to continue pay

468
00:22:14,660 --> 00:22:17,510
their hourly workers and vendors um it's

469
00:22:17,510 --> 00:22:21,140
also so the picture here is Microsoft is

470
00:22:21,140 --> 00:22:23,570
donating the lunches from the cafeteria

471
00:22:23,570 --> 00:22:26,480
that typically serves the rights of

472
00:22:26,480 --> 00:22:30,050
workers to local schools so local feed

473
00:22:30,050 --> 00:22:32,360
the school's program I'm sure they're

474
00:22:32,360 --> 00:22:34,970
collaborating with them I'm sure other

475
00:22:34,970 --> 00:22:36,440
companies are doing something like that

476
00:22:36,440 --> 00:22:37,880
as well

477
00:22:37,880 --> 00:22:40,370
uber eats in grub hub so grab hub is

478
00:22:40,370 --> 00:22:42,170
suspending delivery fees from

479
00:22:42,170 --> 00:22:44,300
independent restaurants ubereats as of

480
00:22:44,300 --> 00:22:46,130
waving delivery fee from independent

481
00:22:46,130 --> 00:22:48,470
restaurants to help them I'm sort of

482
00:22:48,470 --> 00:22:50,750
stay afloat in this time when people

483
00:22:50,750 --> 00:22:53,750
don't dine in um CBS is delivering

484
00:22:53,750 --> 00:22:56,110
prescriptions for free and they're also

485
00:22:56,110 --> 00:23:01,130
enabling people to get the prescriptions

486
00:23:01,130 --> 00:23:03,020
more than 30 days in advance where it's

487
00:23:03,020 --> 00:23:05,990
usually restricted so there's lots and

488
00:23:05,990 --> 00:23:07,850
lots of different examples of corporate

489
00:23:07,850 --> 00:23:10,190
responses where people are just choosing

490
00:23:10,190 --> 00:23:12,260
to donate massive amounts of money and

491
00:23:12,260 --> 00:23:15,290
work time to contribute to these efforts

492
00:23:15,290 --> 00:23:18,170
and you can read more about this so

493
00:23:18,170 --> 00:23:21,170
again if you have an ability to do this

494
00:23:21,170 --> 00:23:21,620
and

495
00:23:21,620 --> 00:23:24,410
employers also do match corporate match

496
00:23:24,410 --> 00:23:26,390
for donations so I would encourage you

497
00:23:26,390 --> 00:23:28,490
to check if your employer Serena as well

498
00:23:28,490 --> 00:23:32,300
I'm and then obviously staying home is

499
00:23:32,300 --> 00:23:35,030
important so I'm gonna play one more

500
00:23:35,030 --> 00:23:41,809
video if it starts or if it doesn't all

501
00:23:41,809 --> 00:23:45,220
right good

502
00:23:46,540 --> 00:23:49,490
throughout history humankind has

503
00:23:49,490 --> 00:23:52,700
prevailed in our darkest moments coming

504
00:23:52,700 --> 00:23:54,740
together to face the very thing that

505
00:23:54,740 --> 00:23:59,510
would extinguish our light this is not

506
00:23:59,510 --> 00:24:04,280
one of those moments at all this is a

507
00:24:04,280 --> 00:24:07,400
moment for pretty much the opposite for

508
00:24:07,400 --> 00:24:12,020
hiding for laying low napping is also

509
00:24:12,020 --> 00:24:16,760
good saving humankind by really really

510
00:24:16,760 --> 00:24:20,750
not getting near Z we're playing games

511
00:24:20,750 --> 00:24:25,030
staring at screens staring at anything

512
00:24:25,030 --> 00:24:30,050
all are the stuff of heroes every

513
00:24:30,050 --> 00:24:32,270
generation as its whelped where

514
00:24:32,270 --> 00:24:35,390
individuals sacrifice makes way for the

515
00:24:35,390 --> 00:24:37,450
good of those who will come after a

516
00:24:37,450 --> 00:24:49,820
higher purpose this one is ours so yeah

517
00:24:49,820 --> 00:24:52,490
I think this is our heroic moment here

518
00:24:52,490 --> 00:24:55,460
so these are their resource lights I

519
00:24:55,460 --> 00:24:57,559
will share the link to my presentation

520
00:24:57,559 --> 00:24:59,480
online so you can find these resources

521
00:24:59,480 --> 00:25:03,200
I'm so data sources and then they're

522
00:25:03,200 --> 00:25:05,450
resources for open source projects and

523
00:25:05,450 --> 00:25:08,990
links to volunteer or donate and thank

524
00:25:08,990 --> 00:25:11,750
you all so much and I'm gonna try to

525
00:25:11,750 --> 00:25:14,510
switch over to questions unless no one

526
00:25:14,510 --> 00:25:16,040
wants to read them for him if there any

527
00:25:16,040 --> 00:25:18,320
other item I jumped in just to see if

528
00:25:18,320 --> 00:25:21,080
there's a fianc doing asking the

529
00:25:21,080 --> 00:25:22,730
questions and an answering straight away

530
00:25:22,730 --> 00:25:24,980
so yeah if anyone does have any

531
00:25:24,980 --> 00:25:27,559
questions please do drop them straight

532
00:25:27,559 --> 00:25:32,090
into either the slider or if you prefer

533
00:25:32,090 --> 00:25:34,690
we also have we also have slack

534
00:25:34,690 --> 00:25:38,230
here as well so just looking through

535
00:25:38,230 --> 00:25:42,370
some of these we have too many questions

536
00:25:42,370 --> 00:25:44,939
yet

537
00:25:45,690 --> 00:25:49,300
how's it effected in terms of in terms

538
00:25:49,300 --> 00:25:52,360
of github yourselves and and and you

539
00:25:52,360 --> 00:25:54,550
know from a work point of view how have

540
00:25:54,550 --> 00:25:57,460
you seen the effect there in terms of

541
00:25:57,460 --> 00:25:59,260
you know most of those most of the

542
00:25:59,260 --> 00:26:01,120
company working from working remotely

543
00:26:01,120 --> 00:26:04,450
anyway or is it even despite that is it

544
00:26:04,450 --> 00:26:07,780
is affecting the dynamic too much yeah

545
00:26:07,780 --> 00:26:10,300
so I I kind of I get the corporate

546
00:26:10,300 --> 00:26:12,310
communication for a bill both github and

547
00:26:12,310 --> 00:26:14,350
Microsoft so that's an interesting when

548
00:26:14,350 --> 00:26:17,320
github used to be a remote company so

549
00:26:17,320 --> 00:26:20,380
this is not new but they this scale at

550
00:26:20,380 --> 00:26:22,990
which people are working from home is

551
00:26:22,990 --> 00:26:25,900
new and then Microsoft is kind of not a

552
00:26:25,900 --> 00:26:28,510
remote friendly company like only some

553
00:26:28,510 --> 00:26:30,460
teams are remote most teams are by

554
00:26:30,460 --> 00:26:33,040
design co-located and so this is kind of

555
00:26:33,040 --> 00:26:34,780
a new thing for people to be working

556
00:26:34,780 --> 00:26:37,630
from home I think the the important

557
00:26:37,630 --> 00:26:41,220
thing about this is that I see a lot of

558
00:26:41,220 --> 00:26:43,810
encouragement from leadership basically

559
00:26:43,810 --> 00:26:47,110
reiterating that hey we like understand

560
00:26:47,110 --> 00:26:50,500
that you're home with your kids and that

561
00:26:50,500 --> 00:26:53,560
you can be 100% productive and we can't

562
00:26:53,560 --> 00:26:55,920
be shipping as many features and maybe

563
00:26:55,920 --> 00:26:58,600
again reliability right now it's more

564
00:26:58,600 --> 00:27:00,460
important because we're seeing an uptick

565
00:27:00,460 --> 00:27:03,100
in all the online usage of all the

566
00:27:03,100 --> 00:27:05,260
services right so that's another thing

567
00:27:05,260 --> 00:27:08,740
that we're sometimes kind of focusing on

568
00:27:08,740 --> 00:27:10,630
reliability even more than pushing new

569
00:27:10,630 --> 00:27:13,480
features right now and I think if you're

570
00:27:13,480 --> 00:27:15,670
in a leadership position that's very

571
00:27:15,670 --> 00:27:18,100
important to not just say it once but

572
00:27:18,100 --> 00:27:20,980
keep sort of posting that communication

573
00:27:20,980 --> 00:27:23,620
hey we're with you it's okay it's going

574
00:27:23,620 --> 00:27:24,700
to be okay

575
00:27:24,700 --> 00:27:26,860
I you know we know this is a tough

576
00:27:26,860 --> 00:27:31,720
situation for everybody mmm sounds good

577
00:27:31,720 --> 00:27:33,850
there's no other questions I don't

578
00:27:33,850 --> 00:27:39,940
believe in either either slack or slider

579
00:27:39,940 --> 00:27:47,620
so we have a very very short time so

580
00:27:47,620 --> 00:27:48,480
I'll leave it

581
00:27:48,480 --> 00:27:51,559
opti such
