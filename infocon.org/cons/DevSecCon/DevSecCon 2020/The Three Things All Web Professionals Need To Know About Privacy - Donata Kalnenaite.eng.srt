00:00:41,940 --> 00:00:44,360
professionals need to know about privacy

14
00:00:44,360 --> 00:00:46,770
before we get started I would really

15
00:00:46,770 --> 00:00:48,930
like to thank the organizers of all the

16
00:00:48,930 --> 00:00:52,320
talks for having me on here I was

17
00:00:52,320 --> 00:00:54,149
supposed to speak at a bunch of events

18
00:00:54,149 --> 00:00:57,180
this year and unfortunately had to miss

19
00:00:57,180 --> 00:00:59,699
all of them but it's really great to be

20
00:00:59,699 --> 00:01:02,340
able to come together and especially do

21
00:01:02,340 --> 00:01:05,188
this as a fundraising event so this is

22
00:01:05,188 --> 00:01:07,560
really no small feat on behalf of the

23
00:01:07,560 --> 00:01:09,299
organizers and figuring out the

24
00:01:09,299 --> 00:01:10,979
technology and all the speakers and

25
00:01:10,979 --> 00:01:13,830
stuff so at first like to thank them for

26
00:01:13,830 --> 00:01:16,409
having me on here and I'd also like to

27
00:01:16,409 --> 00:01:19,799
thank everybody who is listening I can

28
00:01:19,799 --> 00:01:22,380
bet you anything that five years ago you

29
00:01:22,380 --> 00:01:23,970
would not have said that you're going to

30
00:01:23,970 --> 00:01:26,159
be watching a privacy talk in the middle

31
00:01:26,159 --> 00:01:29,130
of a pandemic so I really appreciate you

32
00:01:29,130 --> 00:01:30,900
joining me here as I know that I'm

33
00:01:30,900 --> 00:01:33,659
competing with Netflix and Amazon Prime

34
00:01:33,659 --> 00:01:38,250
so thank you so much so before we get

35
00:01:38,250 --> 00:01:41,610
started I would like to say that privacy

36
00:01:41,610 --> 00:01:44,490
is becoming more and more important in

37
00:01:44,490 --> 00:01:46,770
the eyes of consumers which is pushing

38
00:01:46,770 --> 00:01:49,829
privacy laws forward and these laws will

39
00:01:49,829 --> 00:01:51,720
affect you and your clients no matter

40
00:01:51,720 --> 00:01:54,270
where you're located and so privacy is

41
00:01:54,270 --> 00:01:58,439
something that is not going away so my

42
00:01:58,439 --> 00:02:00,960
goal today is to talk to you about that

43
00:02:00,960 --> 00:02:02,520
and hopefully by the end of today you'll

44
00:02:02,520 --> 00:02:05,729
feel more comfortable knowing stuff

45
00:02:05,729 --> 00:02:07,469
about privacy and even having this

46
00:02:07,469 --> 00:02:10,020
conversation with your clients so let's

47
00:02:10,020 --> 00:02:10,910
get started

48
00:02:10,910 --> 00:02:13,290
so my goal today is

49
00:02:13,290 --> 00:02:15,180
talk to you about three things which

50
00:02:15,180 --> 00:02:17,909
websites need a privacy policy why

51
00:02:17,909 --> 00:02:20,579
privacy policies are important and why

52
00:02:20,579 --> 00:02:22,530
you should be the ones to talk to your

53
00:02:22,530 --> 00:02:25,319
clients about privacy before I get

54
00:02:25,319 --> 00:02:27,689
started on all of this let me first tell

55
00:02:27,689 --> 00:02:30,060
you why I think that I am qualified to

56
00:02:30,060 --> 00:02:33,720
talk to you about privacy so I'm a data

00:02:47,519 --> 00:02:50,579
policy questions and the text and I also

00:02:50,579 --> 00:02:52,590
keep track of changes to privacy laws

65

and update our clients privacy policies

66
00:02:55,530 --> 00:02:59,040
whenever those lost change I'm also the

67

68
00:03:01,680 --> 00:03:03,870

00:03:03,870 --> 00:03:05,930
professionals which is the largest

70
00:03:05,930 --> 00:03:08,790
privacy organization in the world and

71
00:03:08,790 --> 00:03:11,010
most of the newsletter editor for the

72
00:03:11,010 --> 00:03:12,569

00:03:12,569 --> 00:03:16,500
privacy committee and I've taught gdpr

74
00:03:16,500 --> 00:03:18,900
to other attorneys at the Illinois State

75
00:03:18,900 --> 00:03:22,680
Bar and I'm also beekeeper I know that's

76
00:03:22,680 --> 00:03:24,659
really not relevant here but I thought

77
00:03:24,659 --> 00:03:26,879
that it would be fun to share I here's

78
00:03:26,879 --> 00:03:28,680
me and my bees and at the end if you

79
00:03:28,680 --> 00:03:30,269
have any questions about that let me

80
00:03:30,269 --> 00:03:32,790
know and also questions about privacy of

81
00:03:32,790 --> 00:03:37,590
course so let's start with part one what

82
00:03:37,590 --> 00:03:40,010
websites need to have a privacy policy

83
00:03:40,010 --> 00:03:43,229
now there are a lot of misconceptions

84
00:03:43,229 --> 00:03:45,419
with this one a lot of people think that

85
00:03:45,419 --> 00:03:48,479
only ecommerce websites need one or that

86
00:03:48,479 --> 00:03:50,790
only websites that sell or share

87
00:03:50,790 --> 00:03:53,400
personal information need one and that's

88
00:03:53,400 --> 00:03:57,510
really just not the case so let's start

89
00:03:57,510 --> 00:03:59,639
with the one and only definition that

90
00:03:59,639 --> 00:04:01,409
I'll have in here because I'm going to

91
00:04:01,409 --> 00:04:03,239
try to keep this the least amount of dry

92
00:04:03,239 --> 00:04:06,629
possible but personally identifiable

93
00:04:06,629 --> 00:04:09,840
information or PII is any data that

94
00:04:09,840 --> 00:04:13,199
could identify somebody so for example a

95
00:04:13,199 --> 00:04:15,780
name and email a phone number or

96
00:04:15,780 --> 00:04:18,539
physical address and any website that

97
00:04:18,539 --> 00:04:20,909
has a contact form collects personally

98
00:04:20,909 --> 00:04:24,479
identifiable information or PII and the

99
00:04:24,479 --> 00:04:26,700
same holds true for websites that have

100
00:04:26,700 --> 00:04:29,720
newsletter signup forms billing portals

101
00:04:29,720 --> 00:04:32,520
contact forms anything like that all of

102
00:04:32,520 --> 00:04:37,980
those are collecting PII now any website

103
00:04:37,980 --> 00:04:41,070
that collects PII needs to have a

104
00:04:41,070 --> 00:04:44,130
privacy policy and if really you don't

105
00:04:44,130 --> 00:04:45,960
remember anything else from this talk

106
00:04:45,960 --> 00:04:48,240
today it's that any website that

107
00:04:48,240 --> 00:04:50,520
collects PII needs to have a privacy

108
00:04:50,520 --> 00:04:52,800
policy so when you're building a website

109
00:04:52,800 --> 00:04:55,170
that has a contact form or an email

110
00:04:55,170 --> 00:04:57,270
newsletter signup form or a billing

111
00:04:57,270 --> 00:04:59,730
portal or anything like that that's

112
00:04:59,730 --> 00:05:01,950
really when the light bulb should go off

113
00:05:01,950 --> 00:05:04,410
in your head saying okay I'm building

114
00:05:04,410 --> 00:05:06,030
this website that has a contact form

115
00:05:06,030 --> 00:05:08,700
it's collecting PII that means that this

116
00:05:08,700 --> 00:05:10,410
website needs to have a privacy policy

117
00:05:10,410 --> 00:05:15,990
and it's really just that simple now why

118
00:05:15,990 --> 00:05:18,510
does PII collection and privacy matter

119
00:05:18,510 --> 00:05:21,390
why do websites that collect PII need to

120
00:05:21,390 --> 00:05:23,820
have a privacy policy that's going to be

121
00:05:23,820 --> 00:05:26,880
our part to here so at least for me I'm

122
00:05:26,880 --> 00:05:28,950
one of those people that I'm much more

123
00:05:28,950 --> 00:05:32,100
likely to do something if I know why if

124
00:05:32,100 --> 00:05:33,960
you explain to me if you tell me to do

125
00:05:33,960 --> 00:05:35,280
something and you don't tell me why

126
00:05:35,280 --> 00:05:38,070
chances are I won't do it so I think

127
00:05:38,070 --> 00:05:40,110
that that this is going to be a very

128
00:05:40,110 --> 00:05:43,320
important point to consider is why why

129
00:05:43,320 --> 00:05:47,070
does it matter so privacy laws regulate

130
00:05:47,070 --> 00:05:49,410
the collection and use of personally

131
00:05:49,410 --> 00:05:52,620
identifiable information so privacy laws

132
00:05:52,620 --> 00:05:55,500
require websites to disclose what PII is

133
00:05:55,500 --> 00:05:58,650
collected what is done with that PII and

134
00:05:58,650 --> 00:06:01,890
who that PII is shared with and those

135
00:06:01,890 --> 00:06:03,900
required disclosures are made in the

136
00:06:03,900 --> 00:06:06,270
privacy policy so that's what a privacy

137
00:06:06,270 --> 00:06:08,520
policy is it's a document that lets

138
00:06:08,520 --> 00:06:10,920
users or visitors of a particular

139
00:06:10,920 --> 00:06:13,830
website know what is happening with

140
00:06:13,830 --> 00:06:15,570
their personal information once they

141
00:06:15,570 --> 00:06:18,930
submit it to you now just to be clear

142
00:06:18,930 --> 00:06:21,570
there are a lot more disclosures that

143
00:06:21,570 --> 00:06:23,730
these laws require these are just the

144
00:06:23,730 --> 00:06:25,320
main ones they're kind of the meat and

145
00:06:25,320 --> 00:06:29,240
potatoes of what a privacy policy is and

146
00:06:29,240 --> 00:06:32,130
depending on what privacy laws apply to

147
00:06:32,130 --> 00:06:34,290
you you could have a privacy policy

148
00:06:34,290 --> 00:06:36,480
that's very long that makes you know ten

149
00:06:36,480 --> 00:06:38,790
twenty different disclosures you can

150
00:06:38,790 --> 00:06:40,230
have a privacy policy that's

151
00:06:40,230 --> 00:06:42,240
it's a short that has you know three or

152
00:06:42,240 --> 00:06:46,950
five disclosures so as of right now

153
00:06:46,950 --> 00:06:49,980
there are four main privacy laws in the

154
00:06:49,980 --> 00:06:51,900
United States and the European Union

155
00:06:51,900 --> 00:06:54,450
that governed the EU's collection and

156
00:06:54,450 --> 00:06:58,200
disclosure of PII by websites so the

157
00:06:58,200 --> 00:07:00,060
first one is the general data protection

158
00:07:00,060 --> 00:07:03,030
regulation or gdpr which is a privacy

159
00:07:03,030 --> 00:07:05,760
law that protects the privacy rights of

160
00:07:05,760 --> 00:07:08,370
European Union residents I am sure that

161
00:07:08,370 --> 00:07:10,530
a lot of you have heard of this one a

162
00:07:10,530 --> 00:07:12,300
lot of people were freaking out about

163
00:07:12,300 --> 00:07:15,210
this in 2018 and that freaking out

164
00:07:15,210 --> 00:07:19,050
unfortunately hasn't stopped but gdpr

165
00:07:19,050 --> 00:07:21,390
applies to businesses that are located

166
00:07:21,390 --> 00:07:23,820
in the European Union businesses that

167
00:07:23,820 --> 00:07:25,980
offer goods or services to European

168
00:07:25,980 --> 00:07:28,200
Union presidents regardless of that

169
00:07:28,200 --> 00:07:30,600
businesses location or businesses that

170
00:07:30,600 --> 00:07:33,090
monitored the behavior of European Union

171
00:07:33,090 --> 00:07:35,700
residents regardless of that businesses

172
00:07:35,700 --> 00:07:38,910
location so you can see how GPR can

173
00:07:38,910 --> 00:07:40,920
apply to businesses outside of the

174
00:07:40,920 --> 00:07:43,410
European Union if you're located in

175
00:07:43,410 --> 00:07:46,410
Chicago which is where I am and you're

176
00:07:46,410 --> 00:07:48,600
selling things to European Union

177
00:07:48,600 --> 00:07:50,340
residents you need to make sure that

178
00:07:50,340 --> 00:07:53,370
you're complying which you PR the next

179
00:07:53,370 --> 00:07:54,900
one that we have is the California

180
00:07:54,900 --> 00:07:58,350
Online Privacy Protection Act of 2003 or

181
00:07:58,350 --> 00:08:00,960
kelapa which applies to any website that

182
00:08:00,960 --> 00:08:03,090
collects the personal information of

183
00:08:03,090 --> 00:08:06,180
California residents which really could

184
00:08:06,180 --> 00:08:08,580
be pretty much any website with a

185
00:08:08,580 --> 00:08:12,270
contact form located anywhere because

186
00:08:12,270 --> 00:08:14,010
all you need to do is collect the

187
00:08:14,010 --> 00:08:15,630
personal information of California

188
00:08:15,630 --> 00:08:18,480
residents so if you have a contact form

189
00:08:18,480 --> 00:08:21,120
where California residents could submit

190
00:08:21,120 --> 00:08:23,100
their information that's when you need

191
00:08:23,100 --> 00:08:24,360
to make sure that you're caliper

192
00:08:24,360 --> 00:08:26,850
compliant the California consumer

193
00:08:26,850 --> 00:08:29,280
Privacy Act which is a relatively new

194
00:08:29,280 --> 00:08:32,549
law it went into effect January 1st and

195
00:08:32,549 --> 00:08:35,130
it's going to start becoming enforced

196
00:08:35,130 --> 00:08:38,220
July 1st now it's really interesting is

197
00:08:38,220 --> 00:08:40,409
that a lot of groups have asked the

198
00:08:40,409 --> 00:08:42,840
California Attorney General whether this

199
00:08:42,840 --> 00:08:45,450
law is still going to be enforced on

200
00:08:45,450 --> 00:08:49,170
time because of kovat 19 and he

201
00:08:49,170 --> 00:08:51,690
essentially responded that yes July 1st

202
00:08:51,690 --> 00:08:53,450
is the enforcement date

203
00:08:53,450 --> 00:08:55,400
then he also added potentially even

204
00:08:55,400 --> 00:08:58,820
earlier so even though the enforcement

205
00:08:58,820 --> 00:09:01,580
date is July 1st the Attorney General

206
00:09:01,580 --> 00:09:04,100
can prosecute violations going back to

207
00:09:04,100 --> 00:09:10,430
January 1st so a privacy policy that's

208
00:09:10,430 --> 00:09:12,560
compliant with the CCPA and a la place

209
00:09:12,560 --> 00:09:15,350
you need to make sure to do that now but

210
00:09:15,350 --> 00:09:17,780
the CCPA applies to any for-profit

211
00:09:17,780 --> 00:09:19,820
business that does business in

212
00:09:19,820 --> 00:09:22,340
California and that meets one of the

213
00:09:22,340 --> 00:09:24,950
following has annual revenues of twenty

214
00:09:24,950 --> 00:09:27,710
five million or more annually buys

215
00:09:27,710 --> 00:09:31,370
receive sells or shares the PII of 50

216
00:09:31,370 --> 00:09:33,410
thousand or more California residents

217
00:09:33,410 --> 00:09:36,590
households or devices or derives fifty

218
00:09:36,590 --> 00:09:38,450
percent or more of its annual revenue

219
00:09:38,450 --> 00:09:41,060
from selling the PII of California

220
00:09:41,060 --> 00:09:43,760
residents now what's important to note

221
00:09:43,760 --> 00:09:46,100
here as well is that if you don't meet

222
00:09:46,100 --> 00:09:48,740
these thresholds but you do work with

223
00:09:48,740 --> 00:09:50,870
businesses that do meet those thresholds

224
00:09:50,870 --> 00:09:53,690
they might require you to be CCPA

225
00:09:53,690 --> 00:09:56,810
compliant via contract because a big

226
00:09:56,810 --> 00:09:58,670
portion of compliance is offender

227
00:09:58,670 --> 00:10:01,310
management so you need to make sure and

228
00:10:01,310 --> 00:10:03,590
check your contracts to see whether or

229
00:10:03,590 --> 00:10:05,450
not that law would apply to you through

230
00:10:05,450 --> 00:10:07,610
contract even if it doesn't apply to you

231
00:10:07,610 --> 00:10:10,760
through the statute itself and then

232
00:10:10,760 --> 00:10:13,100
lastly we have Nevada Revised Statutes

233
00:10:13,100 --> 00:10:17,270
chapter 603 a and SB 220 which was

234
00:10:17,270 --> 00:10:19,850
amended late last year and that

235
00:10:19,850 --> 00:10:21,650
basically applies to any commercial

236
00:10:21,650 --> 00:10:24,140
website that collects the PII of Nevada

237
00:10:24,140 --> 00:10:27,320
residents and enters into transaction

238
00:10:27,320 --> 00:10:30,230
with a nevada consumer has nexus with

239
00:10:30,230 --> 00:10:32,540
nevada or purposefully directs its

240
00:10:32,540 --> 00:10:35,120
activities towards nevada what that

241
00:10:35,120 --> 00:10:37,130
means is that even if you're not located

242
00:10:37,130 --> 00:10:39,920
in nevada but you have customers out

243
00:10:39,920 --> 00:10:42,740
there you're entering the transactions

244
00:10:42,740 --> 00:10:44,870
with nevada customers you need to make

245
00:10:44,870 --> 00:10:46,340
sure that you have a privacy policy

246
00:10:46,340 --> 00:10:50,300
that's compliant with that law now the

247
00:10:50,300 --> 00:10:52,430
most important thing to remember with

248
00:10:52,430 --> 00:10:55,310
privacy laws is that they are created to

249
00:10:55,310 --> 00:10:57,830
protect the consumers of a particular

250
00:10:57,830 --> 00:11:00,530
state country or region not the

251
00:11:00,530 --> 00:11:03,710
businesses so these privacy laws are

252
00:11:03,710 --> 00:11:05,840
actually very broad and can apply to

253
00:11:05,840 --> 00:11:06,320
this

254
00:11:06,320 --> 00:11:09,620
outside of that state or country as I

255
00:11:09,620 --> 00:11:12,680
just explained so even if you're not

256
00:11:12,680 --> 00:11:15,079
located in California and Nevada or the

257
00:11:15,079 --> 00:11:17,269
European Union that doesn't mean that

258
00:11:17,269 --> 00:11:20,180
these privacy laws won't apply to you it

259
00:11:20,180 --> 00:11:21,500
does mean that you need to pay attention

260
00:11:21,500 --> 00:11:24,230
to what's going on and potentially have

261
00:11:24,230 --> 00:11:26,600
a privacy policy if the laws do apply

262
00:11:26,600 --> 00:11:29,810
and if you or your clients getting

263
00:11:29,810 --> 00:11:32,690
worries across state lines you need to

264
00:11:32,690 --> 00:11:34,639
seriously consider getting a privacy

265
00:11:34,639 --> 00:11:39,680
policy now other states are proposing

266
00:11:39,680 --> 00:11:42,290
privacy bills you know the European

267
00:11:42,290 --> 00:11:45,709
Union had gdpr which is one set of rules

268
00:11:45,709 --> 00:11:49,910
that applies to the entire country to

269
00:11:49,910 --> 00:11:52,100
the entire conglomeration of countries

270
00:11:52,100 --> 00:11:54,709
that is the European Union unfortunately

271
00:11:54,709 --> 00:11:57,350
in the United States we have not seen a

272
00:11:57,350 --> 00:12:00,199
federal privacy law that applies to just

273
00:12:00,199 --> 00:12:03,259
regular websites so we see a lot of

274
00:12:03,259 --> 00:12:05,720
states proposing and passing their own

275
00:12:05,720 --> 00:12:08,990
privacy laws all of which have their own

276
00:12:08,990 --> 00:12:12,560
specific requirements and penalties and

277
00:12:12,560 --> 00:12:15,110
you know privacy policy disclosures and

278
00:12:15,110 --> 00:12:18,079
things like that I won't go through all

279
00:12:18,079 --> 00:12:20,149
of these just because I don't want to

280
00:12:20,149 --> 00:12:22,670
bore you to death but you can find this

281
00:12:22,670 --> 00:12:25,370
tracker on the termagant blog it's term

282
00:12:25,370 --> 00:12:28,339
again and com slash blog and it's the

283
00:12:28,339 --> 00:12:30,920
privacy state privacy bill tracker and

284
00:12:30,920 --> 00:12:33,610
this gets updated pretty frequently

285
00:12:33,610 --> 00:12:36,860
because things change very quickly here

286
00:12:36,860 --> 00:12:40,670
but you know these laws have very

287
00:12:40,670 --> 00:12:42,199
different requirements but they also

288
00:12:42,199 --> 00:12:45,079
have some similarities so for example

289
00:12:45,079 --> 00:12:47,600
each privacy law would require websites

290
00:12:47,600 --> 00:12:50,899
to have a privacy policy and have that

291
00:12:50,899 --> 00:12:53,139
privacy policy make specific disclosures

292
00:12:53,139 --> 00:12:56,209
some of these bills would apply to large

293
00:12:56,209 --> 00:12:58,670
businesses only whereas others would

294
00:12:58,670 --> 00:13:01,790
apply to businesses of any size and then

295
00:13:01,790 --> 00:13:04,040
some of these would allow consumers to

296
00:13:04,040 --> 00:13:07,670
sue businesses directly so for example

297
00:13:07,670 --> 00:13:10,759
we have New York which is proposing a

298
00:13:10,759 --> 00:13:13,550
privacy bill which would allow New York

299
00:13:13,550 --> 00:13:16,490
residents to sue businesses anywhere in

300
00:13:16,490 --> 00:13:18,769
the world just for having a contact form

301
00:13:18,769 --> 00:13:19,350
without

302
00:13:19,350 --> 00:13:22,800
client privacy policy now I'm sure a lot

303
00:13:22,800 --> 00:13:25,320
of us here are keeping a close eye on

304
00:13:25,320 --> 00:13:27,240
the Americans with Disabilities Act

305
00:13:27,240 --> 00:13:30,930
lawsuits and since consumers have been

306
00:13:30,930 --> 00:13:34,140
able to sue businesses directly for 88

307
00:13:34,140 --> 00:13:36,840
violations we have seen a very large

308
00:13:36,840 --> 00:13:40,470
explosion of these these lawsuits with

309
00:13:40,470 --> 00:13:42,120
hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of

310
00:13:42,120 --> 00:13:45,180
them being filed every year and that's

311
00:13:45,180 --> 00:13:47,460
kind of what we are expecting to see

312
00:13:47,460 --> 00:13:51,390
here as well if consumers can sue for

313
00:13:51,390 --> 00:13:55,830
privacy violations but right now we have

314
00:13:55,830 --> 00:13:57,900
the state's attorneys general and the

315
00:13:57,900 --> 00:13:59,610
Federal Trade Commission enforcing these

316
00:13:59,610 --> 00:14:04,380
laws but things could change and you

317
00:14:04,380 --> 00:14:06,450
know another thing that's very important

318
00:14:06,450 --> 00:14:08,820
to note is that all of these bills are

319
00:14:08,820 --> 00:14:10,200
so broad that they could apply to

320
00:14:10,200 --> 00:14:12,690
businesses outside of that state so if

321
00:14:12,690 --> 00:14:14,010
you're located in one of these states

322
00:14:14,010 --> 00:14:16,290
obviously it would apply to you but even

323
00:14:16,290 --> 00:14:18,510
if you're not you know that's something

324
00:14:18,510 --> 00:14:20,340
to consider as well is that you need to

325
00:14:20,340 --> 00:14:21,900
make sure that you're keeping an eye on

326
00:14:21,900 --> 00:14:25,530
these to see what passes and what would

327
00:14:25,530 --> 00:14:30,870
apply to you and what would it now in

328
00:14:30,870 --> 00:14:33,120
terms of what happens if you don't

329
00:14:33,120 --> 00:14:35,550
comply with these penalties for not

330
00:14:35,550 --> 00:14:37,920
complying with privacy laws can range

331
00:14:37,920 --> 00:14:41,910
from 2,500 per violation to 20 million

332
00:14:41,910 --> 00:14:45,030
euros in total now per violation does

333
00:14:45,030 --> 00:14:48,930
not mean per website per policy or per

334
00:14:48,930 --> 00:14:51,660
day it actually means per website

335
00:14:51,660 --> 00:14:53,280
visitor whose privacy rights you

336
00:14:53,280 --> 00:14:56,040
infringed upon so for example if you

337
00:14:56,040 --> 00:14:57,690
have let's say you have a hundred

338
00:14:57,690 --> 00:14:59,940
visitors to your website per month which

339
00:14:59,940 --> 00:15:02,640
is really low and you know 10 of those

340
00:15:02,640 --> 00:15:05,570
are from California and the fine is

341
00:15:05,570 --> 00:15:08,220
$2,500 per person you could really see

342
00:15:08,220 --> 00:15:11,330
how that could translate into an

343
00:15:11,330 --> 00:15:15,270
extremely large fine even if you do only

344
00:15:15,270 --> 00:15:18,780
have a few dozen website visitors per

345
00:15:18,780 --> 00:15:24,240
month now some of you may still want to

346
00:15:24,240 --> 00:15:27,000
roll the dice on the fines so let me

347
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:29,190
tell you about a few other reasons as to

348
00:15:29,190 --> 00:15:32,940
why you your company your client care

349
00:15:32,940 --> 00:15:36,840
a privacy so recent study by Cisco found

350
00:15:36,840 --> 00:15:40,110
that 70% of organizations say that they

351
00:15:40,110 --> 00:15:42,270
received significant business benefits

352
00:15:42,270 --> 00:15:45,060
from privacy um in terms of significant

353
00:15:45,060 --> 00:15:46,700
business benefits what does that mean

354
00:15:46,700 --> 00:15:49,830
lower costs in terms of breaches lower

355
00:15:49,830 --> 00:15:53,130
likelihood of a breach and just better

356
00:15:53,130 --> 00:15:56,580
efficiency better sales a study by

357
00:15:56,580 --> 00:15:58,890
Amnesty International found that privacy

358
00:15:58,890 --> 00:16:01,290
concerns are having a major impact on

359
00:16:01,290 --> 00:16:04,110
people's online behavior that

360
00:16:04,110 --> 00:16:06,960
essentially means that people who are

361
00:16:06,960 --> 00:16:11,790
part of a platform that does not respect

362
00:16:11,790 --> 00:16:14,400
their privacy rights can actually end up

363
00:16:14,400 --> 00:16:17,070
leaving the platform and I know that a

364
00:16:17,070 --> 00:16:18,990
few years ago that really wasn't the

365
00:16:18,990 --> 00:16:22,410
case but after the whole Cambridge

366
00:16:22,410 --> 00:16:24,960
analytical scandal that's when really

367
00:16:24,960 --> 00:16:26,670
consumer started pushing for their

368
00:16:26,670 --> 00:16:29,040
privacy rights started looking for

369
00:16:29,040 --> 00:16:32,430
privacy policies on a website stopped

370
00:16:32,430 --> 00:16:35,010
using services that abuse their privacy

371
00:16:35,010 --> 00:16:37,290
rights and that's essentially what we've

372
00:16:37,290 --> 00:16:39,960
seen since then privacy concerns are

373
00:16:39,960 --> 00:16:42,300
having a major impact on people's online

374
00:16:42,300 --> 00:16:44,160
behavior and they will leave your

375
00:16:44,160 --> 00:16:46,470
platform if they feel like their privacy

376
00:16:46,470 --> 00:16:50,040
rights are not being respected and then

377
00:16:50,040 --> 00:16:52,050
a different study by Cisco found that

378
00:16:52,050 --> 00:16:54,060
privacy concerns can slow down the sales

379
00:16:54,060 --> 00:16:56,940
cycle by an average of seven point eight

380
00:16:56,940 --> 00:16:59,970
weeks now in a small business setting

381
00:16:59,970 --> 00:17:02,040
that's actually a really long time if

382
00:17:02,040 --> 00:17:04,790
you think about it you don't want to

383
00:17:04,790 --> 00:17:08,579
delay your sales by seven or eight weeks

384
00:17:08,579 --> 00:17:12,180
that's you know that's crazy over

385
00:17:12,180 --> 00:17:13,980
something as simple as not having a

386
00:17:13,980 --> 00:17:16,709
privacy policy that is a simple solution

387
00:17:16,709 --> 00:17:19,650
to get and all things being equal

388
00:17:19,650 --> 00:17:21,869
consumers will use the services and

389
00:17:21,869 --> 00:17:23,849
products that do not abuse their rights

390
00:17:23,849 --> 00:17:27,359
and lastly privacy is a fundamental

391
00:17:27,359 --> 00:17:30,510
human right caring about privacy is the

392
00:17:30,510 --> 00:17:33,740
right thing to do I think all of us as

393
00:17:33,740 --> 00:17:36,860
business owners might consider these

394
00:17:36,860 --> 00:17:41,220
requirements as big as onerous as you

395
00:17:41,220 --> 00:17:43,380
know pretty intense for a small business

396
00:17:43,380 --> 00:17:45,070
to have to do

397
00:17:45,070 --> 00:17:47,830
if we look at it from our perspective as

398
00:17:47,830 --> 00:17:50,950
consumers we can really see how we

399
00:17:50,950 --> 00:17:52,510
interact with websites that don't

400
00:17:52,510 --> 00:17:55,240
respect your privacy so for example a

401
00:17:55,240 --> 00:17:59,049
few years ago I put in my information to

402
00:17:59,049 --> 00:18:02,890
go to a conference and I put in my phone

403
00:18:02,890 --> 00:18:04,840
number and I wasn't sure about that but

404
00:18:04,840 --> 00:18:06,280
they asked for it and I was just like

405
00:18:06,280 --> 00:18:07,960
okay whatever I'll just put it in and

406
00:18:07,960 --> 00:18:09,880
then a few hours later is getting

407
00:18:09,880 --> 00:18:11,860
marketing texts from companies that I've

408
00:18:11,860 --> 00:18:13,929
never signed up to receive marketing

409
00:18:13,929 --> 00:18:16,480
text from so you know as a consumer I

410
00:18:16,480 --> 00:18:18,429
can tell right away when my personal

411
00:18:18,429 --> 00:18:20,470
information has been sold when it's

412
00:18:20,470 --> 00:18:21,880
being used for marketing without my

413
00:18:21,880 --> 00:18:24,790
permission and things like that and it's

414
00:18:24,790 --> 00:18:28,000
not a pleasant experience so I think as

415
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:30,100
consumers all of us can agree that

416
00:18:30,100 --> 00:18:32,799
privacy and caring about privacy is the

417
00:18:32,799 --> 00:18:36,010
right thing to do and you know we know

418
00:18:36,010 --> 00:18:37,809
that other consumers feel the same way

419
00:18:37,809 --> 00:18:39,929
as well

420
00:18:39,929 --> 00:18:43,750
all right so time to talk about our

421
00:18:43,750 --> 00:18:47,710
final topic why as a web professional

422
00:18:47,710 --> 00:18:49,750
you should be the one to talk to your

423
00:18:49,750 --> 00:18:54,790
clients about privacy so why does any of

424
00:18:54,790 --> 00:18:57,400
the his concern you as a web

425
00:18:57,400 --> 00:18:59,320
professional maybe you build websites

426
00:18:59,320 --> 00:19:01,860
you design websites you build software

427
00:19:01,860 --> 00:19:04,890
or you do marketing for your clients

428
00:19:04,890 --> 00:19:09,280
really for your clients you're kind of

429
00:19:09,280 --> 00:19:12,130
their guide to the things all things

430
00:19:12,130 --> 00:19:15,700
internet right so depending on the level

431
00:19:15,700 --> 00:19:18,370
of sophistication of your clients they

432
00:19:18,370 --> 00:19:19,390
might need your help

433
00:19:19,390 --> 00:19:21,580
opening an email or they might just be

434
00:19:21,580 --> 00:19:24,040
looking to you for her a good web design

435
00:19:24,040 --> 00:19:26,590
service or something like that

436
00:19:26,590 --> 00:19:29,260
and they might not necessarily know all

437
00:19:29,260 --> 00:19:31,960
of this privacy stuff I mean it is the

438
00:19:31,960 --> 00:19:34,630
business's responsibility to make sure

439
00:19:34,630 --> 00:19:37,600
that their website is compliant but you

440
00:19:37,600 --> 00:19:39,220
know if they're not that experienced

441
00:19:39,220 --> 00:19:40,809
with the Internet if they're not that

442
00:19:40,809 --> 00:19:43,600
experienced with things online and

443
00:19:43,600 --> 00:19:45,340
what's the cutting edge of our industry

444
00:19:45,340 --> 00:19:46,960
right now they might not know these

445
00:19:46,960 --> 00:19:48,730
requirements and they might be relying

446
00:19:48,730 --> 00:19:51,010
on you to tell you things that they

447
00:19:51,010 --> 00:19:53,020
don't know especially since you're

448
00:19:53,020 --> 00:19:55,059
building the contact forms building the

449
00:19:55,059 --> 00:19:58,360
newsletter signup forms so speaking of

450
00:19:58,360 --> 00:19:58,909
your

451
00:19:58,909 --> 00:20:01,369
about privacy makes you look proactive

452
00:20:01,369 --> 00:20:04,099
and professional this is privacy

453
00:20:04,099 --> 00:20:06,710
something new in our industry and it's

454
00:20:06,710 --> 00:20:08,539
really the cutting edge and there are a

455
00:20:08,539 --> 00:20:11,119
lot of things that are changing and you

456
00:20:11,119 --> 00:20:13,460
know privacy wasn't that important a few

457
00:20:13,460 --> 00:20:16,039
years ago to most people but the fact

458
00:20:16,039 --> 00:20:18,559
that you know now that it is really

459
00:20:18,559 --> 00:20:20,479
makes you a proactive and professional

460
00:20:20,479 --> 00:20:22,609
it helps you stand above the competition

461
00:20:22,609 --> 00:20:25,429
who may not be following these industry

462
00:20:25,429 --> 00:20:27,950
trends improves client retention and

463
00:20:27,950 --> 00:20:29,090
loyalty

464
00:20:29,090 --> 00:20:32,169
you know clients that see you more as a

465
00:20:32,169 --> 00:20:35,090
business advisor as somebody who can

466
00:20:35,090 --> 00:20:36,950
talk to them about more than just their

467
00:20:36,950 --> 00:20:39,950
website really helps retain those

468
00:20:39,950 --> 00:20:41,539
clients it really helps get their

469
00:20:41,539 --> 00:20:43,519
loyalty and their thankfulness

470
00:20:43,519 --> 00:20:46,220
for helping them be protected from fines

471
00:20:46,220 --> 00:20:48,889
and lawsuits and then can help document

472
00:20:48,889 --> 00:20:52,820
this and protect your agency so the

473
00:20:52,820 --> 00:20:54,289
truth is that people love to blame

474
00:20:54,289 --> 00:20:56,779
others for their own failings if you're

475
00:20:56,779 --> 00:21:00,379
designing websites that collect PII make

476
00:21:00,379 --> 00:21:01,669
sure you document the fact that a

477
00:21:01,669 --> 00:21:04,340
privacy policy is needed which can help

478
00:21:04,340 --> 00:21:06,590
you cover yourself and protect your

479
00:21:06,590 --> 00:21:09,409
agency in case your clients get sued or

480
00:21:09,409 --> 00:21:12,109
fined you know you don't want them to be

481
00:21:12,109 --> 00:21:13,639
coming back to you and saying oh you

482
00:21:13,639 --> 00:21:16,279
never told me this or oh you said that

483
00:21:16,279 --> 00:21:18,529
it didn't matter so that's something to

484
00:21:18,529 --> 00:21:22,009
keep in mind now if you do want to talk

485
00:21:22,009 --> 00:21:23,659
to your clients about this and I hope

486
00:21:23,659 --> 00:21:26,210
that you do the one main thing to

487
00:21:26,210 --> 00:21:28,789
remember is to tell them hey you know

488
00:21:28,789 --> 00:21:30,259
I'm building you a website with a

489
00:21:30,259 --> 00:21:32,869
contact form it's collecting personally

490
00:21:32,869 --> 00:21:35,299
identifiable information and there might

491
00:21:35,299 --> 00:21:37,369
be privacy laws that apply to you that

492
00:21:37,369 --> 00:21:39,190
require you to have a privacy policy

493
00:21:39,190 --> 00:21:42,470
that's really all you have to say to get

494
00:21:42,470 --> 00:21:45,379
that conversation started for them just

495
00:21:45,379 --> 00:21:47,840
providing that insight is actually

496
00:21:47,840 --> 00:21:49,609
should be immensely helpful to your

497
00:21:49,609 --> 00:21:52,940
clients because again they might just

498
00:21:52,940 --> 00:21:57,109
not know that so a couple places where

499
00:21:57,109 --> 00:21:59,239
you could tell your clients about this

500
00:21:59,239 --> 00:22:01,940
when coding new projects you can add

501
00:22:01,940 --> 00:22:03,889
this into your quote because you will

502
00:22:03,889 --> 00:22:05,599
need to be building out like privacy

503
00:22:05,599 --> 00:22:08,539
policy in terms of service pages before

504
00:22:08,539 --> 00:22:11,599
a launch of a website because once the

505
00:22:11,599 --> 00:22:12,470
website launch

506
00:22:12,470 --> 00:22:15,260
that's when it's collecting PII so

507
00:22:15,260 --> 00:22:17,539
before our launch for sure in

508
00:22:17,539 --> 00:22:19,130
maintenance plans it can be a great

509
00:22:19,130 --> 00:22:22,820
value ad for you you know if your

510
00:22:22,820 --> 00:22:24,710
maintenance plans include hosting and

511
00:22:24,710 --> 00:22:26,960
security and then they also include

512
00:22:26,960 --> 00:22:30,380
privacy if you have not talked to your

513
00:22:30,380 --> 00:22:32,390
clients about this before now is a great

514
00:22:32,390 --> 00:22:34,010
time to talk to them about it because

515
00:22:34,010 --> 00:22:35,659
right now is the time where it's

516
00:22:35,659 --> 00:22:38,360
becoming more and more important and the

517
00:22:38,360 --> 00:22:41,049
likelihood of fines and lawsuits is

518
00:22:41,049 --> 00:22:43,400
exponentially increasing for websites

519
00:22:43,400 --> 00:22:46,010
that collect PII so if you haven't

520
00:22:46,010 --> 00:22:47,659
talked to your clients about this before

521
00:22:47,659 --> 00:22:51,070
now is a great time to do so

522
00:22:51,070 --> 00:22:55,010
all right and then lastly before we go

523
00:22:55,010 --> 00:22:58,820
into questions let's talk about where to

524
00:22:58,820 --> 00:23:02,090
get privacy policies so a few different

525
00:23:02,090 --> 00:23:05,210
places privacy attorneys I would not

526
00:23:05,210 --> 00:23:08,299
recommend using a regular attorney to

527
00:23:08,299 --> 00:23:11,480
get a privacy policy privacy law is a

528
00:23:11,480 --> 00:23:14,390
very specialized field that has a lot of

529
00:23:14,390 --> 00:23:16,640
laws a lot of rules and a lot of cases

530
00:23:16,640 --> 00:23:19,490
and regular business attorneys just

531
00:23:19,490 --> 00:23:22,760
might not be aware of those so a privacy

532
00:23:22,760 --> 00:23:24,860
attorney can write a privacy policy for

533
00:23:24,860 --> 00:23:28,309
your clients it's not a cheap service by

534
00:23:28,309 --> 00:23:30,530
any means but it can be a really good

535
00:23:30,530 --> 00:23:33,110
option for your big clients or clients

536
00:23:33,110 --> 00:23:35,900
that need special compliance what I mean

537
00:23:35,900 --> 00:23:38,360
by that is anybody that needs HIPAA

538
00:23:38,360 --> 00:23:40,549
compliance that's collecting health care

539
00:23:40,549 --> 00:23:42,919
information or anybody that is

540
00:23:42,919 --> 00:23:45,320
collecting information from kids under

541
00:23:45,320 --> 00:23:49,850
the age of 13 those are kind of onerous

542
00:23:49,850 --> 00:23:52,940
requirements and they're very extensive

543
00:23:52,940 --> 00:23:54,679
requirements and having a privacy

544
00:23:54,679 --> 00:23:56,570
attorney right of privacy policy for a

545
00:23:56,570 --> 00:24:00,530
website like that is a good solution you

546
00:24:00,530 --> 00:24:02,059
know if you do end up going with an

547
00:24:02,059 --> 00:24:04,010
attorney make sure that you ask them

548
00:24:04,010 --> 00:24:06,260
what their strategy is for keeping your

549
00:24:06,260 --> 00:24:10,220
policy up to date so if they have no

550
00:24:10,220 --> 00:24:12,380
strategy or if they say we're going to

551
00:24:12,380 --> 00:24:13,970
charge you more each time we have to

552
00:24:13,970 --> 00:24:16,070
update it just know that could end up

553
00:24:16,070 --> 00:24:17,870
costing you tens of thousands of dollars

554
00:24:17,870 --> 00:24:20,830
because these laws change so frequently

555
00:24:20,830 --> 00:24:23,510
another option for getting a privacy

556
00:24:23,510 --> 00:24:25,100
policy is a generator

557
00:24:25,100 --> 00:24:28,340
a generator is a software that will ask

558
00:24:28,340 --> 00:24:30,110
you questions about your business and

559
00:24:30,110 --> 00:24:32,419
about your website and then we'll create

560
00:24:32,419 --> 00:24:35,660
a specialized custom privacy policy for

561
00:24:35,660 --> 00:24:38,059
you based on your answers and based on

562
00:24:38,059 --> 00:24:39,470
your needs

563
00:24:39,470 --> 00:24:42,470
usually generators are a faster and more

564
00:24:42,470 --> 00:24:45,049
cost effective solution and can work

565
00:24:45,049 --> 00:24:46,850
really well for the majority of your

566
00:24:46,850 --> 00:24:52,030
clients alright so that's the end of my

567
00:24:52,030 --> 00:24:56,600
presentation and would right now be a

568
00:24:56,600 --> 00:25:01,820
good time to go into questions I think

569
00:25:01,820 --> 00:25:06,230
no I'm looking to see if we have some

570
00:25:06,230 --> 00:25:08,120
questions in the pipeline thank you so

571
00:25:08,120 --> 00:25:11,870
much donata for your educational peek

572
00:25:11,870 --> 00:25:15,440
into privacy law let me see what we have

573
00:25:15,440 --> 00:25:25,039
so far I'm not seeing anything in our QA

574
00:25:25,039 --> 00:25:31,700
yet so before we get questions

575
00:25:31,700 --> 00:25:33,919
submissions I actually have some common

576
00:25:33,919 --> 00:25:36,620
questions that I get asked a lot maybe I

577
00:25:36,620 --> 00:25:38,299
could answer those we get those like

578
00:25:38,299 --> 00:25:41,990
every day ok and so the first question

579
00:25:41,990 --> 00:25:44,390
that I get all of the time is who's

580
00:25:44,390 --> 00:25:47,120
going to sue me for not having a privacy

581
00:25:47,120 --> 00:25:51,380
policy so as of right now if you are

582
00:25:51,380 --> 00:25:53,960
located in the European Union that would

583
00:25:53,960 --> 00:25:56,780
be a Data Protection Authority and if

584
00:25:56,780 --> 00:25:58,789
you're located in the United States it

585
00:25:58,789 --> 00:26:01,400
would be your state or another States

586
00:26:01,400 --> 00:26:03,770
Attorney General or the Federal Trade

587
00:26:03,770 --> 00:26:06,679
Commission and those are actually very

588
00:26:06,679 --> 00:26:09,590
active with privacy law infringement

589
00:26:09,590 --> 00:26:14,929
with JD PR we have seen over 200 fines

590
00:26:14,929 --> 00:26:18,350
right now being issued and I know that

591
00:26:18,350 --> 00:26:20,960
we hear a lot about the googles and the

592
00:26:20,960 --> 00:26:23,210
Facebook's getting fake getting fines

593
00:26:23,210 --> 00:26:25,100
you know billions and billions of

594
00:26:25,100 --> 00:26:29,390
dollars but so these cases don't

595
00:26:29,390 --> 00:26:32,390
actually make it into the news a lot but

596
00:26:32,390 --> 00:26:34,850
we have seen cases where like a single

597
00:26:34,850 --> 00:26:37,880
person marketing shop was fine 60,000

598
00:26:37,880 --> 00:26:38,660
euro

599
00:26:38,660 --> 00:26:41,540
for changing the email of one customer

600
00:26:41,540 --> 00:26:44,090
in their CRM so it's something that has

601
00:26:44,090 --> 00:26:46,970
happened quite a bit even one person

602
00:26:46,970 --> 00:26:48,890
companies or companies that have

603
00:26:48,890 --> 00:26:51,170
infringed on the privacy rights of one

604
00:26:51,170 --> 00:26:54,350
person if you don't believe me a Google

605
00:26:54,350 --> 00:26:57,020
search GDP our enforcement tracker and I

606
00:26:57,020 --> 00:26:58,280
think it's like one of the first search

607
00:26:58,280 --> 00:27:00,160
results and you'll see all of those

608
00:27:00,160 --> 00:27:03,980
which are very very interesting but if

609
00:27:03,980 --> 00:27:06,170
we sneeze some of these new proposed

610
00:27:06,170 --> 00:27:09,260
privacy bills being passed we will

611
00:27:09,260 --> 00:27:11,570
actually see consumers being able to sue

612
00:27:11,570 --> 00:27:15,590
businesses directly and at least in the

613
00:27:15,590 --> 00:27:17,360
u.s. we all know what that means that

614
00:27:17,360 --> 00:27:20,240
means a lot of lawsuits so that's

615
00:27:20,240 --> 00:27:22,310
something to keep in mind as well is if

616
00:27:22,310 --> 00:27:25,070
some of these privacy bills paths you

617
00:27:25,070 --> 00:27:26,570
know we could see concern you're suing

618
00:27:26,570 --> 00:27:32,960
businesses directly as well great yeah

619
00:27:32,960 --> 00:27:35,780
it looks like we have question here

620
00:27:35,780 --> 00:27:39,110
couple questions the first what are your

621
00:27:39,110 --> 00:27:41,300
common methods on reading privacy

622
00:27:41,300 --> 00:27:44,600
policies and what jumps out as a bad

623
00:27:44,600 --> 00:27:48,170
policy mmm that's actually a really good

624
00:27:48,170 --> 00:27:48,650
one

625
00:27:48,650 --> 00:27:51,260
um so I have read probably hundreds of

626
00:27:51,260 --> 00:27:56,330
these and you know a few things that I

627
00:27:56,330 --> 00:28:00,350
always look for is which laws apply to

628
00:28:00,350 --> 00:28:04,010
you so if I see somebody that is

629
00:28:04,010 --> 00:28:06,950
starting off with these are your privacy

630
00:28:06,950 --> 00:28:08,930
rights under the general data protection

631
00:28:08,930 --> 00:28:12,050
regulation and then they list like three

632
00:28:12,050 --> 00:28:14,750
of them and then miss the rest that's

633
00:28:14,750 --> 00:28:17,630
always a big issue for me a lot of

634
00:28:17,630 --> 00:28:20,030
privacy policies that I see that were

635
00:28:20,030 --> 00:28:24,980
written a longer time ago by somebody's

636
00:28:24,980 --> 00:28:27,410
not necessarily as experienced as they

637
00:28:27,410 --> 00:28:29,570
should be writing of the privacy policy

638
00:28:29,570 --> 00:28:33,730
is an explanation of what the law is

639
00:28:33,730 --> 00:28:36,800
like Kalpa is a law that protects the

640
00:28:36,800 --> 00:28:39,280
privacy rights of California residents

641
00:28:39,280 --> 00:28:42,530
that's usually a very good telltale sign

642
00:28:42,530 --> 00:28:44,480
of somebody who's not very experienced

643
00:28:44,480 --> 00:28:46,370
writing these because the consumer

644
00:28:46,370 --> 00:28:48,140
doesn't care what the law is we care

645
00:28:48,140 --> 00:28:50,270
about what their rights are

646
00:28:50,270 --> 00:28:52,010
and they care about what the disclosures

647
00:28:52,010 --> 00:28:55,100
are that need to be made I also see a

648
00:28:55,100 --> 00:28:58,280
lot of privacy policies that will have

649
00:28:58,280 --> 00:29:00,320
like half of the disclosures that they

650
00:29:00,320 --> 00:29:02,930
need to make or privacy policies that

651
00:29:02,930 --> 00:29:04,820
have conflicting statements like we

652
00:29:04,820 --> 00:29:07,120
don't sell your data and then you know

653
00:29:07,120 --> 00:29:09,920
ten paragraphs later we do sell your

654
00:29:09,920 --> 00:29:14,030
data one thing that I definitely would

655
00:29:14,030 --> 00:29:16,430
want to caution people against is

656
00:29:16,430 --> 00:29:18,410
copying and pasting somebody else's

657
00:29:18,410 --> 00:29:22,010
privacy policy for a few reasons one

658
00:29:22,010 --> 00:29:23,930
they might not have all of the required

659
00:29:23,930 --> 00:29:26,480
disclosures or the disclosures may be

660
00:29:26,480 --> 00:29:28,790
completely incorrect which I've seen a

661
00:29:28,790 --> 00:29:33,620
lot of and to those privacy policies

662
00:29:33,620 --> 00:29:35,840
don't update or they don't let you know

663
00:29:35,840 --> 00:29:38,390
when they update so you're kind of at

664
00:29:38,390 --> 00:29:40,670
their mercy to make sure that they

665
00:29:40,670 --> 00:29:43,100
updated their policy before the law went

666
00:29:43,100 --> 00:29:44,690
into effect and then you have to check

667
00:29:44,690 --> 00:29:46,730
back and bla bla bla and go back and

668
00:29:46,730 --> 00:29:48,830
forth which is a huge thing and then

669
00:29:48,830 --> 00:29:51,430
also you know if you're for example

670
00:29:51,430 --> 00:29:54,080
copying and pasting of GDP our privacy

671
00:29:54,080 --> 00:29:56,810
policy but you don't need to be gdpr

672
00:29:56,810 --> 00:29:57,650
compliant

673
00:29:57,650 --> 00:29:59,570
you're all of a sudden subjecting

674
00:29:59,570 --> 00:30:01,100
yourself to doing a bunch of things that

675
00:30:01,100 --> 00:30:03,500
you wouldn't normally have to do so for

676
00:30:03,500 --> 00:30:06,280
example one of the gdpr rights is to

677
00:30:06,280 --> 00:30:09,200
delete the personal information of a

678
00:30:09,200 --> 00:30:12,350
consumer who asks you to delete it if we

679
00:30:12,350 --> 00:30:14,060
don't have to provide that right but you

680
00:30:14,060 --> 00:30:16,220
copy and paste somebody else's policy

681
00:30:16,220 --> 00:30:18,680
you're you're gonna have to do that and

682
00:30:18,680 --> 00:30:19,910
you're going to have to figure out how

683
00:30:19,910 --> 00:30:21,710
to delete their information and figure

684
00:30:21,710 --> 00:30:23,450
out how to respond to them and do it in

685
00:30:23,450 --> 00:30:25,160
the right amount of time so you could

686
00:30:25,160 --> 00:30:27,140
really be subjecting yourself to a whole

687
00:30:27,140 --> 00:30:30,230
lot more work than then you would

688
00:30:30,230 --> 00:30:32,300
normally need to do from what applies to

689
00:30:32,300 --> 00:30:34,520
your business so definitely discourage

690
00:30:34,520 --> 00:30:37,480
cannot not being and pasting as well

691
00:30:37,480 --> 00:30:40,160
thank you so much for your insight you

692
00:30:40,160 --> 00:30:42,140
do have some other questions regarding

693
00:30:42,140 --> 00:30:44,660
GDP are we are out of time I would

694
00:30:44,660 --> 00:30:46,700
encourage folks to please jump into the

695
00:30:46,700 --> 00:30:48,350
slack and not I assume you will be there

696
00:30:48,350 --> 00:30:50,570
to answer some additional questions well

697
00:30:50,570 --> 00:30:54,050
yeah wonderful fantastic so thank you

698
00:30:54,050 --> 00:30:56,060
very much and then we're moving right

699
00:30:56,060 --> 00:30:59,230
along thank you
