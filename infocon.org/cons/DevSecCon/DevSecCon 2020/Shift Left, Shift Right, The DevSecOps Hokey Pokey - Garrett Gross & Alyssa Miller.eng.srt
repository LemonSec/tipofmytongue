1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,280
so um up next we have shift

2
00:00:03,280 --> 00:00:07,040
left shift right the devops hokey pokey

3
00:00:07,040 --> 00:00:10,000
uh i'm in love with the title alone so

4
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:12,240
i'm really excited to uh bring out our

5
00:00:12,240 --> 00:00:14,639
our speakers and i'll let you guys

6
00:00:14,639 --> 00:00:16,560
introduce and take it away

7
00:00:16,560 --> 00:00:19,600
sure so yeah i appreciate it so uh yeah

8
00:00:19,600 --> 00:00:20,640
like you said

9
00:00:20,640 --> 00:00:22,960
uh thanks jeff shift left shift right

10
00:00:22,960 --> 00:00:25,599
the devsec ops hokey pokey

11
00:00:25,599 --> 00:00:29,039
uh we are gonna talk today all about how

12
00:00:29,039 --> 00:00:32,558
we employ strategies to bring security

13
00:00:32,558 --> 00:00:34,559
into this devops picture devops has been

14
00:00:34,559 --> 00:00:36,640
around since 2008

15
00:00:36,640 --> 00:00:40,000
we've pretty well know what that animal

16
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:41,360
looks like at this point but we still

17
00:00:41,360 --> 00:00:43,600
struggle to make security a part of it

18
00:00:43,600 --> 00:00:45,360
so first and foremost couple

19
00:00:45,360 --> 00:00:47,760
introductions my name's alyssa miller

20
00:00:47,760 --> 00:00:50,000
i'm an application security advocate for

21
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:50,800
sneak

22
00:00:50,800 --> 00:00:54,000
i am a recovering developer for

23
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:56,640
i spent 10 years in financial services

24
00:00:56,640 --> 00:00:57,760
as a dev

25
00:00:57,760 --> 00:01:00,480
before i moved into security where i've

26
00:01:00,480 --> 00:01:02,000
been for the last

27
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:05,040
almost 15 years of my life so

28
00:01:05,040 --> 00:01:08,320
um i have the fortunate uh

29
00:01:08,320 --> 00:01:10,960
position of having seen both sides of

30
00:01:10,960 --> 00:01:11,439
this

31
00:01:11,439 --> 00:01:12,960
well at least two of the three sides of

32
00:01:12,960 --> 00:01:15,119
the equation and quite honestly i've

33
00:01:15,119 --> 00:01:15,840
seen the op

34
00:01:15,840 --> 00:01:17,360
side too but i've got someone really

35
00:01:17,360 --> 00:01:19,759
cool here with me as well

36
00:01:19,759 --> 00:01:21,280
hey there folks uh my name is garrett

37
00:01:21,280 --> 00:01:23,600
gross i work as a technical advisor

38
00:01:23,600 --> 00:01:24,799
doing application security at rapid

39
00:01:24,799 --> 00:01:27,439
rapid7 my background is

40
00:01:27,439 --> 00:01:29,680
your typical script kitty starting from

41
00:01:29,680 --> 00:01:31,040
a young age and

42
00:01:31,040 --> 00:01:34,560
somehow honed that uh that into a trade

43
00:01:34,560 --> 00:01:36,479
so happy to be here and i love speaking

44
00:01:36,479 --> 00:01:38,240
with alyssa what this is our what

45
00:01:38,240 --> 00:01:40,640
third time speaking together yeah we did

46
00:01:40,640 --> 00:01:41,280
a

47
00:01:41,280 --> 00:01:43,600
couple events at rsa earlier this year

48
00:01:43,600 --> 00:01:44,479
and

49
00:01:44,479 --> 00:01:46,079
who who knew those were going to be the

50
00:01:46,079 --> 00:01:48,399
better times right i'll go back in the

51
00:01:48,399 --> 00:01:49,520
old days right yeah

52
00:01:49,520 --> 00:01:52,720
right yeah so the long long ago um

53
00:01:52,720 --> 00:01:56,000
yeah it has definitely changed a lot but

54
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:59,600
um you know it's not just our world

55
00:01:59,600 --> 00:02:01,840
as we know it now that's changed a lot

56
00:02:01,840 --> 00:02:03,360
um software development

57
00:02:03,360 --> 00:02:07,520
has really changed a lot and

58
00:02:07,520 --> 00:02:09,440
our attitudes towards software

59
00:02:09,440 --> 00:02:12,000
development have changed quite a bit too

60
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:13,760
when we talk about security years and

61
00:02:13,760 --> 00:02:15,360
years ago we would

62
00:02:15,360 --> 00:02:19,040
have conversations about security and

63
00:02:19,040 --> 00:02:21,440
the message always was kind of you know

64
00:02:21,440 --> 00:02:23,200
the security team was responsible for

65
00:02:23,200 --> 00:02:23,680
that

66
00:02:23,680 --> 00:02:25,520
the security team they handle it all

67
00:02:25,520 --> 00:02:27,920
right um

68
00:02:27,920 --> 00:02:30,560
we've grown with this message for years

69
00:02:30,560 --> 00:02:31,280
now

70
00:02:31,280 --> 00:02:33,760
we've pushed out there this idea of okay

71
00:02:33,760 --> 00:02:35,440
security's got to push left we need to

72
00:02:35,440 --> 00:02:36,000
get

73
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:39,120
further into the sdlc and then devops

74
00:02:39,120 --> 00:02:40,879
throwed up about you know a little over

75
00:02:40,879 --> 00:02:42,480
a decade ago and then it was like oh my

76
00:02:42,480 --> 00:02:43,280
gosh

77
00:02:43,280 --> 00:02:44,800
these developers are moving faster and

78
00:02:44,800 --> 00:02:46,720
faster how are we going to keep up with

79
00:02:46,720 --> 00:02:47,840
security

80
00:02:47,840 --> 00:02:50,400
and so we've put more and more pressure

81
00:02:50,400 --> 00:02:51,599
on developers

82
00:02:51,599 --> 00:02:55,040
and indeed we see that in the attitudes

83
00:02:55,040 --> 00:02:58,080
across the industry sneak last year in

84
00:02:58,080 --> 00:03:00,720
our annual state of open source security

85
00:03:00,720 --> 00:03:02,000
report

86
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:05,360
we asked a question on our survey

87
00:03:05,360 --> 00:03:07,519
who should own application security in

88
00:03:07,519 --> 00:03:09,200
your organization as you can see the

89
00:03:09,200 --> 00:03:10,280
results

90
00:03:10,280 --> 00:03:13,760
overwhelmingly they picked developers

91
00:03:13,760 --> 00:03:16,480
so this wasn't a pick one this was a

92
00:03:16,480 --> 00:03:18,560
multi-select as you can see from the

93
00:03:18,560 --> 00:03:20,879
the percentages here and yet developers

94
00:03:20,879 --> 00:03:21,840
stood out

95
00:03:21,840 --> 00:03:24,560
far and away more than security or

96
00:03:24,560 --> 00:03:26,799
operations or anyone else

97
00:03:26,799 --> 00:03:29,519
garrett i assume you've heard this

98
00:03:29,519 --> 00:03:30,640
before too

99
00:03:30,640 --> 00:03:32,879
yeah i mean this is consistent with what

100
00:03:32,879 --> 00:03:34,720
we hear all the time i think every time

101
00:03:34,720 --> 00:03:36,000
you and i ask this question

102
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:38,640
it's about the same split and you know

103
00:03:38,640 --> 00:03:40,560
my experience was

104
00:03:40,560 --> 00:03:43,760
we only had so much influence you know

105
00:03:43,760 --> 00:03:46,959
you started to see how much multifaceted

106
00:03:46,959 --> 00:03:49,599
uh buy-in you needed from other parts of

107
00:03:49,599 --> 00:03:51,120
the business not only just the

108
00:03:51,120 --> 00:03:54,319
the technical stakeholders so we see

109
00:03:54,319 --> 00:03:54,799
this

110
00:03:54,799 --> 00:03:56,480
this you know trend shifting now to

111
00:03:56,480 --> 00:03:58,319
where developers are

112
00:03:58,319 --> 00:04:01,599
thought to own security but you know

113
00:04:01,599 --> 00:04:03,040
we're starting to see that it's uh it's

114
00:04:03,040 --> 00:04:05,920
kind of shared amongst the organizations

115
00:04:05,920 --> 00:04:08,480
so that's not the only thing that's

116
00:04:08,480 --> 00:04:10,640
changed about development

117
00:04:10,640 --> 00:04:13,360
you know i think back to when i was a

118
00:04:13,360 --> 00:04:14,000
developer

119
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:16,160
right and if i wrote an application i

120
00:04:16,160 --> 00:04:17,279
had an application that was a hundred

121
00:04:17,279 --> 00:04:18,639
thousand lines of code

122
00:04:18,639 --> 00:04:20,399
i pretty much wrote a hundred thousand

123
00:04:20,399 --> 00:04:22,720
lines of code yeah maybe i pulled in

124
00:04:22,720 --> 00:04:24,479
other redistributables and things that

125
00:04:24,479 --> 00:04:26,639
were in you know whether they're in dlls

126
00:04:26,639 --> 00:04:28,080
or other libraries or things

127
00:04:28,080 --> 00:04:29,919
however you know depending where we were

128
00:04:29,919 --> 00:04:32,080
programming at the time

129
00:04:32,080 --> 00:04:34,479
but that's all changed now and it's it's

130
00:04:34,479 --> 00:04:35,440
really

131
00:04:35,440 --> 00:04:38,240
become exacerbated by this devops

132
00:04:38,240 --> 00:04:39,360
approach

133
00:04:39,360 --> 00:04:43,440
and really that's led to this growth in

134
00:04:43,440 --> 00:04:45,040
open source packages

135
00:04:45,040 --> 00:04:47,600
so i can take an application like this

136
00:04:47,600 --> 00:04:48,160
example

137
00:04:48,160 --> 00:04:50,800
java pack or application three java

138
00:04:50,800 --> 00:04:52,800
files 80 lines of code this developer

139
00:04:52,800 --> 00:04:53,840
wrote

140
00:04:53,840 --> 00:04:57,280
but they included seven other packages

141
00:04:57,280 --> 00:04:57,919
you can see

142
00:04:57,919 --> 00:05:01,120
the the spring boot framework here and

143
00:05:01,120 --> 00:05:03,199
being included and what happens is now

144
00:05:03,199 --> 00:05:04,160
those seven

145
00:05:04,160 --> 00:05:05,759
dependencies that i have in my

146
00:05:05,759 --> 00:05:07,199
application

147
00:05:07,199 --> 00:05:08,320
well they've all got their own

148
00:05:08,320 --> 00:05:10,320
dependencies too so

149
00:05:10,320 --> 00:05:12,560
that turns into 59 additional

150
00:05:12,560 --> 00:05:14,400
dependencies that i may or may not even

151
00:05:14,400 --> 00:05:15,639
know about but that's

152
00:05:15,639 --> 00:05:18,560
713 000 lines of code

153
00:05:18,560 --> 00:05:22,880
my 80 lines turned into 713 000.

154
00:05:22,880 --> 00:05:26,000
that's almost a 1 000 increase in

155
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:29,120
application size and the worst part is i

156
00:05:29,120 --> 00:05:30,240
might not even know

157
00:05:30,240 --> 00:05:32,639
all of what's there well and you could

158
00:05:32,639 --> 00:05:34,479
say well okay why don't you just

159
00:05:34,479 --> 00:05:36,160
dig into it why don't you just check out

160
00:05:36,160 --> 00:05:37,919
what what that code base looks like of

161
00:05:37,919 --> 00:05:39,600
all these dependencies but

162
00:05:39,600 --> 00:05:42,080
you got to remember the nature of devops

163
00:05:42,080 --> 00:05:43,520
the speed at which we now

164
00:05:43,520 --> 00:05:45,759
operate uh prevents that it would be

165
00:05:45,759 --> 00:05:47,680
absolutely impossible and your your

166
00:05:47,680 --> 00:05:49,680
business would not support

167
00:05:49,680 --> 00:05:52,800
that level of manual introspection i

168
00:05:52,800 --> 00:05:53,120
guess

169
00:05:53,120 --> 00:05:56,479
you could call it that yeah i mean if

170
00:05:56,479 --> 00:05:58,319
for anybody that's ever see this is

171
00:05:58,319 --> 00:05:59,759
where if we were live i'd be asking you

172
00:05:59,759 --> 00:06:01,600
who's ever tried to like manually walk a

173
00:06:01,600 --> 00:06:04,319
dependency tree

174
00:06:04,319 --> 00:06:06,720
it's night marriage and so that that can

175
00:06:06,720 --> 00:06:09,039
be something that's truly difficult

176
00:06:09,039 --> 00:06:10,880
but it's not just developers who have a

177
00:06:10,880 --> 00:06:12,720
problem it's the op

178
00:06:12,720 --> 00:06:15,440
side so here's this is a great tweet

179
00:06:15,440 --> 00:06:17,280
from kelsey hightower i was debating how

180
00:06:17,280 --> 00:06:18,319
i was going to quote it

181
00:06:18,319 --> 00:06:20,400
and ultimately we just decided you know

182
00:06:20,400 --> 00:06:22,240
what we'll just take kelsey's

183
00:06:22,240 --> 00:06:25,360
tweet directly you know if this is the

184
00:06:25,360 --> 00:06:27,199
reality when you want to spin up an

185
00:06:27,199 --> 00:06:28,960
application environment

186
00:06:28,960 --> 00:06:31,120
you're going to roll that that new

187
00:06:31,120 --> 00:06:32,720
infrastructure

188
00:06:32,720 --> 00:06:34,880
this is everything that's involved but

189
00:06:34,880 --> 00:06:36,880
yet we're expecting the developers more

190
00:06:36,880 --> 00:06:39,120
and more as we move into

191
00:06:39,120 --> 00:06:42,720
this you know containers and

192
00:06:42,720 --> 00:06:45,520
cloud native environments all these new

193
00:06:45,520 --> 00:06:48,000
paradigms we're expecting developers to

194
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:48,880
be able to write

195
00:06:48,880 --> 00:06:51,599
code that defines all of these

196
00:06:51,599 --> 00:06:52,800
components

197
00:06:52,800 --> 00:06:54,880
to the infrastructure that their

198
00:06:54,880 --> 00:06:56,960
software is going to run in

199
00:06:56,960 --> 00:06:59,840
and so now we're saying okay devs you're

200
00:06:59,840 --> 00:07:01,759
responsible for developing code

201
00:07:01,759 --> 00:07:03,280
you're responsible for making sure it's

202
00:07:03,280 --> 00:07:05,199
secure and all by the way

203
00:07:05,199 --> 00:07:08,240
it's up to you devs to take care of this

204
00:07:08,240 --> 00:07:10,080
whole upside of it as well because

205
00:07:10,080 --> 00:07:12,319
hey we're doing a devops culture here we

206
00:07:12,319 --> 00:07:13,840
you know dev and ops you're all together

207
00:07:13,840 --> 00:07:16,000
so you all work this together

208
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:18,720
and this is just adding further

209
00:07:18,720 --> 00:07:20,639
complexity

210
00:07:20,639 --> 00:07:22,240
yeah and on the security side you almost

211
00:07:22,240 --> 00:07:24,160
have to be an expert in in

212
00:07:24,160 --> 00:07:26,560
how each of these interoperate and who's

213
00:07:26,560 --> 00:07:28,400
sharing which permissions and

214
00:07:28,400 --> 00:07:30,960
you know kelsey's talking about uh you

215
00:07:30,960 --> 00:07:31,440
need

216
00:07:31,440 --> 00:07:33,280
you know the rest of that as well bring

217
00:07:33,280 --> 00:07:35,280
servers people in glue

218
00:07:35,280 --> 00:07:37,120
well i mean i don't know what you think

219
00:07:37,120 --> 00:07:38,720
alyssa but that glue to me is

220
00:07:38,720 --> 00:07:39,680
communication

221
00:07:39,680 --> 00:07:42,080
and kind of like a a shared buy-in and

222
00:07:42,080 --> 00:07:42,880
that's uh

223
00:07:42,880 --> 00:07:44,560
that's quite the evolution in in that

224
00:07:44,560 --> 00:07:46,479
relationship i mean yeah we're seeing it

225
00:07:46,479 --> 00:07:48,160
today and and we're seeing folks that

226
00:07:48,160 --> 00:07:48,800
are

227
00:07:48,800 --> 00:07:50,400
really executing and firing on all

228
00:07:50,400 --> 00:07:52,400
cylinders but for those folks that are

229
00:07:52,400 --> 00:07:53,680
in that

230
00:07:53,680 --> 00:07:56,879
you know transition to a devops or

231
00:07:56,879 --> 00:07:59,360
you know in the security auspices a ci

232
00:07:59,360 --> 00:08:00,479
cd type

233
00:08:00,479 --> 00:08:03,520
uh integration uh it's it's tough and

234
00:08:03,520 --> 00:08:06,479
it's not uh it's not the easiest path

235
00:08:06,479 --> 00:08:08,080
yeah so you mentioned security right i

236
00:08:08,080 --> 00:08:08,560
mean

237
00:08:08,560 --> 00:08:12,479
oh my god talk about complexity

238
00:08:12,479 --> 00:08:14,240
we're adding more and more technology

239
00:08:14,240 --> 00:08:16,560
every day that security is now

240
00:08:16,560 --> 00:08:19,520
gotta be aware of we're adding all of

241
00:08:19,520 --> 00:08:21,120
these things in terms

242
00:08:21,120 --> 00:08:24,720
of compliance factors and

243
00:08:24,720 --> 00:08:27,039
audits and and all these layers of

244
00:08:27,039 --> 00:08:28,479
security that we're looking for

245
00:08:28,479 --> 00:08:31,440
so now add this on top and this is what

246
00:08:31,440 --> 00:08:33,120
we're talking about now when we say

247
00:08:33,120 --> 00:08:34,240
devsecops

248
00:08:34,240 --> 00:08:36,799
we're looking for people who run a

249
00:08:36,799 --> 00:08:38,320
shared responsibility

250
00:08:38,320 --> 00:08:41,839
across all these areas and indeed i mean

251
00:08:41,839 --> 00:08:43,839
you know you've got two security people

252
00:08:43,839 --> 00:08:46,800
here sitting in a devops track

253
00:08:46,800 --> 00:08:48,640
which should tell you something right

254
00:08:48,640 --> 00:08:50,000
away that

255
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:52,320
all right there's more work to be done

256
00:08:52,320 --> 00:08:53,519
here

257
00:08:53,519 --> 00:08:56,320
well and i mean again that relationship

258
00:08:56,320 --> 00:08:57,760
kind of getting this going

259
00:08:57,760 --> 00:09:00,000
not only relies on mastery and uh just

260
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:01,760
an awareness of all these technologies

261
00:09:01,760 --> 00:09:02,399
but

262
00:09:02,399 --> 00:09:05,839
also relies on your ability to execute

263
00:09:05,839 --> 00:09:08,160
uh in a time frame that you know you've

264
00:09:08,160 --> 00:09:09,680
already committed to and like alyssa

265
00:09:09,680 --> 00:09:10,240
said i

266
00:09:10,240 --> 00:09:12,080
i'm not a developer i've never done been

267
00:09:12,080 --> 00:09:13,519
a developer i have the utmost

268
00:09:13,519 --> 00:09:16,080
uh most respect for dev teams but that

269
00:09:16,080 --> 00:09:18,240
motivation of getting stuff out quickly

270
00:09:18,240 --> 00:09:19,920
is much different from

271
00:09:19,920 --> 00:09:23,279
my motivation which is i'm culpable for

272
00:09:23,279 --> 00:09:26,000
the security of this product so um

273
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:28,240
timing you know and and speed and stuff

274
00:09:28,240 --> 00:09:29,440
that's

275
00:09:29,440 --> 00:09:30,959
it's kind of a meeting in the middle and

276
00:09:30,959 --> 00:09:32,640
trying to understand each side and each

277
00:09:32,640 --> 00:09:33,920
other's motivations

278
00:09:33,920 --> 00:09:35,360
is also kind of what comes into play

279
00:09:35,360 --> 00:09:38,480
here yeah and and so

280
00:09:38,480 --> 00:09:41,120
you have kind of that what we've always

281
00:09:41,120 --> 00:09:41,760
felt

282
00:09:41,760 --> 00:09:45,920
in these silos is those conflicting

283
00:09:45,920 --> 00:09:48,160
priorities right so if we look at the

284
00:09:48,160 --> 00:09:50,320
reality of what's happening in devsecops

285
00:09:50,320 --> 00:09:51,120
today

286
00:09:51,120 --> 00:09:53,279
we've got developers trying to push

287
00:09:53,279 --> 00:09:55,360
right because we're telling them hey

288
00:09:55,360 --> 00:09:56,399
you've got more and more of the

289
00:09:56,399 --> 00:09:57,279
infrastructure

290
00:09:57,279 --> 00:10:00,080
you're writing code that's defining the

291
00:10:00,080 --> 00:10:00,720
very

292
00:10:00,720 --> 00:10:02,560
infrastructure on which your stuff's

293
00:10:02,560 --> 00:10:04,320
going to run whether it's in a cloud

294
00:10:04,320 --> 00:10:06,000
whether you're using some other

295
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:08,320
container environment whatever it is

296
00:10:08,320 --> 00:10:10,399
as a result of that we've got ops

297
00:10:10,399 --> 00:10:12,160
pushing up the stack

298
00:10:12,160 --> 00:10:15,680
because more and more this is now

299
00:10:15,680 --> 00:10:17,839
code defined less and less of the

300
00:10:17,839 --> 00:10:19,600
infrastructure is actually physical

301
00:10:19,600 --> 00:10:21,839
hardware that we're worrying about

302
00:10:21,839 --> 00:10:23,760
and then you've got security who have

303
00:10:23,760 --> 00:10:25,760
for the last two decades

304
00:10:25,760 --> 00:10:29,040
at least has been trying trying trying

305
00:10:29,040 --> 00:10:29,600
to push

306
00:10:29,600 --> 00:10:32,240
left and so the thing i really liked in

307
00:10:32,240 --> 00:10:33,040
kelsey's

308
00:10:33,040 --> 00:10:34,959
tweet i think we're gonna referencing

309
00:10:34,959 --> 00:10:36,320
back to that a few times

310
00:10:36,320 --> 00:10:39,519
is you know he mentions people

311
00:10:39,519 --> 00:10:42,480
so often when we talk devsecops we talk

312
00:10:42,480 --> 00:10:43,279
about

313
00:10:43,279 --> 00:10:45,760
we get hung up in technology and maybe

314
00:10:45,760 --> 00:10:47,760
we think about process right we think

315
00:10:47,760 --> 00:10:49,440
about a devops pipeline we think about

316
00:10:49,440 --> 00:10:51,040
ci cd and we think about how we can

317
00:10:51,040 --> 00:10:53,279
automate that and make it faster

318
00:10:53,279 --> 00:10:55,839
all too often we forget that devops and

319
00:10:55,839 --> 00:10:57,120
therefore dev sec

320
00:10:57,120 --> 00:11:00,240
ops is really all about the culture so

321
00:11:00,240 --> 00:11:02,800
how do we bring these people together

322
00:11:02,800 --> 00:11:04,800
yeah there's only so much that pizza and

323
00:11:04,800 --> 00:11:06,399
drinks can do to

324
00:11:06,399 --> 00:11:08,640
to heal that that relationship that you

325
00:11:08,640 --> 00:11:10,560
know it just traditionally has been

326
00:11:10,560 --> 00:11:13,279
tenuous um i know that what i've

327
00:11:13,279 --> 00:11:14,880
experienced in the past is

328
00:11:14,880 --> 00:11:16,720
something gets pushed out it's you know

329
00:11:16,720 --> 00:11:18,240
pushed out to production

330
00:11:18,240 --> 00:11:20,800
you run some sort of external scan you

331
00:11:20,800 --> 00:11:22,640
know pen test or a desk scan or

332
00:11:22,640 --> 00:11:23,760
something like that

333
00:11:23,760 --> 00:11:25,839
and then you communicate those results

334
00:11:25,839 --> 00:11:26,880
back to this

335
00:11:26,880 --> 00:11:29,440
somewhat voluminous format and just adds

336
00:11:29,440 --> 00:11:31,440
a bunch of work and you know oftentimes

337
00:11:31,440 --> 00:11:32,399
the dev teams

338
00:11:32,399 --> 00:11:34,000
spend a lot of time poking holes in the

339
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:36,320
tools and kind of proving why

340
00:11:36,320 --> 00:11:37,760
why they don't work that well is you

341
00:11:37,760 --> 00:11:39,360
know rather than then chewing through

342
00:11:39,360 --> 00:11:42,000
the results and kind of abiding by your

343
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:44,880
remediation guidance and it's that

344
00:11:44,880 --> 00:11:47,040
feedback loop right that slow feedback

345
00:11:47,040 --> 00:11:47,519
loop

346
00:11:47,519 --> 00:11:49,360
that makes this traditional approach

347
00:11:49,360 --> 00:11:51,279
that you see here not work anymore

348
00:11:51,279 --> 00:11:54,720
yeah this is why security is struggling

349
00:11:54,720 --> 00:11:57,839
so hard with devops still

350
00:11:57,839 --> 00:12:00,639
over a decade later it's because we've

351
00:12:00,639 --> 00:12:02,399
always thought of security as we're the

352
00:12:02,399 --> 00:12:03,360
gatekeepers

353
00:12:03,360 --> 00:12:05,040
we have these gates between the various

354
00:12:05,040 --> 00:12:07,680
phases of that delivery pipeline

355
00:12:07,680 --> 00:12:10,560
and there's this big feedback loop and

356
00:12:10,560 --> 00:12:12,000
like you said

357
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:15,279
we create these huge reports of here's

358
00:12:15,279 --> 00:12:16,720
all your vulnerabilities you got to fix

359
00:12:16,720 --> 00:12:17,200
them

360
00:12:17,200 --> 00:12:20,000
we don't enable developers to address

361
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:21,040
that as

362
00:12:21,040 --> 00:12:23,760
part of their processes and what we need

363
00:12:23,760 --> 00:12:25,680
to do is we need to give them

364
00:12:25,680 --> 00:12:27,680
the knowledge and the ability to make

365
00:12:27,680 --> 00:12:29,040
decisions

366
00:12:29,040 --> 00:12:31,200
so that they can do this as a part of

367
00:12:31,200 --> 00:12:33,600
those phases of their development

368
00:12:33,600 --> 00:12:36,160
so rather than having these gates

369
00:12:36,160 --> 00:12:36,720
between

370
00:12:36,720 --> 00:12:40,079
phases how do we make security practices

371
00:12:40,079 --> 00:12:43,519
a part of that phase how does threat

372
00:12:43,519 --> 00:12:46,399
modeling become part of the backlog how

373
00:12:46,399 --> 00:12:46,720
do

374
00:12:46,720 --> 00:12:48,480
sas and das tools become part of our

375
00:12:48,480 --> 00:12:50,480
build and test processes

376
00:12:50,480 --> 00:12:52,480
how does container security fit in with

377
00:12:52,480 --> 00:12:56,399
our deployment process and so forth

378
00:12:56,399 --> 00:12:58,959
yeah absolutely and again that

379
00:12:58,959 --> 00:12:59,839
relationship

380
00:12:59,839 --> 00:13:01,920
uh proving that you're there to augment

381
00:13:01,920 --> 00:13:03,120
it in a positive way

382
00:13:03,120 --> 00:13:05,440
rather than hinder it is key and you

383
00:13:05,440 --> 00:13:06,399
know

384
00:13:06,399 --> 00:13:08,160
what better way than to actually put

385
00:13:08,160 --> 00:13:09,680
this functionality

386
00:13:09,680 --> 00:13:11,360
uh in the hands of your development

387
00:13:11,360 --> 00:13:13,600
teams rather than abstracting and you

388
00:13:13,600 --> 00:13:14,240
know kind of

389
00:13:14,240 --> 00:13:16,480
kind of making them play by your rules

390
00:13:16,480 --> 00:13:18,240
offer that same functionality and that

391
00:13:18,240 --> 00:13:18,639
same

392
00:13:18,639 --> 00:13:21,440
reach and visibility through like you

393
00:13:21,440 --> 00:13:22,480
know the ide

394
00:13:22,480 --> 00:13:25,440
or uh deploying an automation framework

395
00:13:25,440 --> 00:13:26,639
like jenkins

396
00:13:26,639 --> 00:13:29,920
it goes a very long way and again it

397
00:13:29,920 --> 00:13:32,399
uh kind of in tandem builds a little bit

398
00:13:32,399 --> 00:13:34,160
of responsibility

399
00:13:34,160 --> 00:13:37,519
in the development team of security yep

400
00:13:37,519 --> 00:13:39,519
and that's that concept of frictionless

401
00:13:39,519 --> 00:13:40,800
enablement

402
00:13:40,800 --> 00:13:44,160
this is what makes devsecops work

403
00:13:44,160 --> 00:13:47,040
when i can enable my developers with

404
00:13:47,040 --> 00:13:48,720
security practices

405
00:13:48,720 --> 00:13:50,480
that bring them the tools and the

406
00:13:50,480 --> 00:13:53,120
decision making power that they need

407
00:13:53,120 --> 00:13:55,199
to be able to do this in a way that is

408
00:13:55,199 --> 00:13:56,320
frictionless

409
00:13:56,320 --> 00:13:59,040
to their existing development processes

410
00:13:59,040 --> 00:14:01,120
this is kind of the holy grail

411
00:14:01,120 --> 00:14:04,240
of devsecops so how do we chase this

412
00:14:04,240 --> 00:14:05,040
down

413
00:14:05,040 --> 00:14:06,720
well we need to start by just reducing

414
00:14:06,720 --> 00:14:08,480
the noise and fatigue we talked about

415
00:14:08,480 --> 00:14:10,160
these large reports

416
00:14:10,160 --> 00:14:12,560
and how getting that at the end of a

417
00:14:12,560 --> 00:14:14,240
development cycle when we're ready to go

418
00:14:14,240 --> 00:14:15,519
deploy

419
00:14:15,519 --> 00:14:17,440
you know if we're in a ci cd pipeline in

420
00:14:17,440 --> 00:14:19,040
particular we can't afford those long

421
00:14:19,040 --> 00:14:20,079
feedback loops

422
00:14:20,079 --> 00:14:22,800
so how can we start reducing that why

423
00:14:22,800 --> 00:14:24,160
mention threat modeling

424
00:14:24,160 --> 00:14:26,560
how do we bring threat modeling into the

425
00:14:26,560 --> 00:14:28,000
backlog

426
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:31,440
well make it part of the user story

427
00:14:31,440 --> 00:14:34,959
why doesn't the user story capture

428
00:14:34,959 --> 00:14:36,959
the threat model for that particular

429
00:14:36,959 --> 00:14:38,240
user story

430
00:14:38,240 --> 00:14:39,680
think about it this way if you've got

431
00:14:39,680 --> 00:14:41,120
business people you've got business

432
00:14:41,120 --> 00:14:42,480
analysts or

433
00:14:42,480 --> 00:14:44,320
whoever it is that's writing your user

434
00:14:44,320 --> 00:14:45,600
stories

435
00:14:45,600 --> 00:14:48,000
why are they aren't they the most

436
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:48,639
capable

437
00:14:48,639 --> 00:14:52,079
actually of being able to put context

438
00:14:52,079 --> 00:14:53,199
around what the threats

439
00:14:53,199 --> 00:14:55,519
are that that user story introduces to

440
00:14:55,519 --> 00:14:57,120
the application

441
00:14:57,120 --> 00:14:58,880
now with that information as part of the

442
00:14:58,880 --> 00:15:01,120
user story when i pull that user story

443
00:15:01,120 --> 00:15:02,240
into my sprint

444
00:15:02,240 --> 00:15:05,440
i know that okay i can prioritize how

445
00:15:05,440 --> 00:15:06,959
i'm going to design

446
00:15:06,959 --> 00:15:10,079
you know as i'm coding this like i can

447
00:15:10,079 --> 00:15:11,199
start to

448
00:15:11,199 --> 00:15:12,959
prioritize based on the risks that have

449
00:15:12,959 --> 00:15:14,240
been identified through that threat

450
00:15:14,240 --> 00:15:14,959
model

451
00:15:14,959 --> 00:15:18,639
and now as i'm designing for code

452
00:15:18,639 --> 00:15:21,440
i know what the requirements are the the

453
00:15:21,440 --> 00:15:24,399
security controls that i need to address

454
00:15:24,399 --> 00:15:27,279
that are gonna ultimately mitigate those

455
00:15:27,279 --> 00:15:28,160
threats

456
00:15:28,160 --> 00:15:30,560
to that user story that i'm now working

457
00:15:30,560 --> 00:15:34,079
to implement within my application

458
00:15:34,079 --> 00:15:36,399
and of course this continues flowing up

459
00:15:36,399 --> 00:15:38,240
up the line then through the pipeline

460
00:15:38,240 --> 00:15:41,199
it hits ci cd if i've got that

461
00:15:41,199 --> 00:15:42,959
information from the user's

462
00:15:42,959 --> 00:15:47,040
story onward and i'm constantly building

463
00:15:47,040 --> 00:15:48,480
off of that

464
00:15:48,480 --> 00:15:51,360
now i've already defined my unit test

465
00:15:51,360 --> 00:15:52,079
cases

466
00:15:52,079 --> 00:15:54,399
that are at that first level after

467
00:15:54,399 --> 00:15:57,199
commit within my ci cd pipeline

468
00:15:57,199 --> 00:15:59,839
so i've now enabled the ability to

469
00:15:59,839 --> 00:16:00,959
automate

470
00:16:00,959 --> 00:16:03,360
we've heard that term a lot and we it

471
00:16:03,360 --> 00:16:04,639
that's another one that feels like the

472
00:16:04,639 --> 00:16:07,199
holy grail that we never quite achieve

473
00:16:07,199 --> 00:16:09,199
i can automate those tests in a whole

474
00:16:09,199 --> 00:16:11,360
new way just by bringing that threat

475
00:16:11,360 --> 00:16:13,120
modeling information so early in the

476
00:16:13,120 --> 00:16:14,800
process

477
00:16:14,800 --> 00:16:16,480
yeah and that way it's not perceived as

478
00:16:16,480 --> 00:16:18,480
an interrupt again it's a

479
00:16:18,480 --> 00:16:22,480
positive augmentation of their process

480
00:16:22,480 --> 00:16:24,240
um and you know you talk about

481
00:16:24,240 --> 00:16:26,639
automation um that's thrown around a lot

482
00:16:26,639 --> 00:16:30,079
and uh oftentimes the the

483
00:16:30,079 --> 00:16:31,920
i don't know the process involved in

484
00:16:31,920 --> 00:16:33,759
getting automation going the process

485
00:16:33,759 --> 00:16:36,959
and i mean just getting a dev team uh

486
00:16:36,959 --> 00:16:39,120
aware that this automation is happening

487
00:16:39,120 --> 00:16:40,399
and you know used to

488
00:16:40,399 --> 00:16:43,040
the cadence of maybe receiving uh the

489
00:16:43,040 --> 00:16:44,240
vulnerability reports and then

490
00:16:44,240 --> 00:16:45,680
remediating them

491
00:16:45,680 --> 00:16:47,920
um just you know getting there again

492
00:16:47,920 --> 00:16:50,480
it's a process but once you get there

493
00:16:50,480 --> 00:16:53,120
that that trust of we're kind of we're

494
00:16:53,120 --> 00:16:55,120
all aligned in the same goal is a lot

495
00:16:55,120 --> 00:16:56,880
easier to elucidate than

496
00:16:56,880 --> 00:17:01,040
hey here's a 400 page report good luck

497
00:17:01,040 --> 00:17:03,360
so and that's a really good point right

498
00:17:03,360 --> 00:17:05,520
if i want developers to adopt

499
00:17:05,520 --> 00:17:09,199
my security initiatives my security

500
00:17:09,199 --> 00:17:11,199
practices and i say that as a security

501
00:17:11,199 --> 00:17:12,799
person that's the my my my

502
00:17:12,799 --> 00:17:17,280
right i need to come meet them

503
00:17:17,280 --> 00:17:19,679
where they live i need to be leveraging

504
00:17:19,679 --> 00:17:21,679
automation

505
00:17:21,679 --> 00:17:24,480
how do i you mentioned jenkins before

506
00:17:24,480 --> 00:17:25,839
how do i bring

507
00:17:25,839 --> 00:17:27,919
into that continuous integration

508
00:17:27,919 --> 00:17:29,280
environment

509
00:17:29,280 --> 00:17:32,799
these capabilities and it's looking at

510
00:17:32,799 --> 00:17:36,400
how do i select tools that are going to

511
00:17:36,400 --> 00:17:37,280
fit into this

512
00:17:37,280 --> 00:17:39,760
automated pipeline and so from a

513
00:17:39,760 --> 00:17:41,120
security perspective

514
00:17:41,120 --> 00:17:44,240
this needs to be part of our focus so

515
00:17:44,240 --> 00:17:47,360
as we're looking at this grand scheme of

516
00:17:47,360 --> 00:17:47,919
all right

517
00:17:47,919 --> 00:17:50,960
here's everything that's within

518
00:17:50,960 --> 00:17:54,240
a devops or devsecops pipeline

519
00:17:54,240 --> 00:17:57,120
i need to make sure that those elements

520
00:17:57,120 --> 00:17:57,760
that i'm

521
00:17:57,760 --> 00:17:59,919
asking my developers to implement

522
00:17:59,919 --> 00:18:01,440
integrate with these technologies that

523
00:18:01,440 --> 00:18:03,840
they're using

524
00:18:03,840 --> 00:18:06,640
yeah absolutely and again that's when

525
00:18:06,640 --> 00:18:08,160
you're looking for these tools look for

526
00:18:08,160 --> 00:18:10,799
extensibility look for the ability to

527
00:18:10,799 --> 00:18:13,840
you know drive these tools using api

528
00:18:13,840 --> 00:18:15,600
calls rather than having to

529
00:18:15,600 --> 00:18:18,400
to operate within a ui even if it's some

530
00:18:18,400 --> 00:18:20,080
kind of you know single pane of glass

531
00:18:20,080 --> 00:18:22,960
type pitch that we're all familiar with

532
00:18:22,960 --> 00:18:25,440
as developers you're used to you know

533
00:18:25,440 --> 00:18:26,480
interacting in a

534
00:18:26,480 --> 00:18:28,160
in a much different manner so things

535
00:18:28,160 --> 00:18:30,160
like you know these jenkins automation

536
00:18:30,160 --> 00:18:30,559
or

537
00:18:30,559 --> 00:18:32,720
integrations it's all api driven and so

538
00:18:32,720 --> 00:18:35,120
you can even roll your own automation if

539
00:18:35,120 --> 00:18:35,600
you're

540
00:18:35,600 --> 00:18:38,080
if you're savvy uh and then the the

541
00:18:38,080 --> 00:18:39,919
feasibility of using those tools is

542
00:18:39,919 --> 00:18:41,280
still the same

543
00:18:41,280 --> 00:18:43,360
and you even see the ecosystems up here

544
00:18:43,360 --> 00:18:44,799
so you know thinking

545
00:18:44,799 --> 00:18:46,400
again in terms of shortening these

546
00:18:46,400 --> 00:18:48,320
feedback cycles looking for

547
00:18:48,320 --> 00:18:51,440
tools that instead of providing

548
00:18:51,440 --> 00:18:53,520
a report at all what about having those

549
00:18:53,520 --> 00:18:55,520
tools integrated in the ide

550
00:18:55,520 --> 00:18:57,840
where i'm typing and in real time if i'm

551
00:18:57,840 --> 00:19:00,160
making a call to a vulnerable package

552
00:19:00,160 --> 00:19:02,480
why can't i have a tool that tells me

553
00:19:02,480 --> 00:19:03,840
right there in my id

554
00:19:03,840 --> 00:19:05,440
hey you're pulling in something here

555
00:19:05,440 --> 00:19:07,200
that's got a vulnerability are you sure

556
00:19:07,200 --> 00:19:09,039
you really want to do this

557
00:19:09,039 --> 00:19:11,440
and then give the developers that

558
00:19:11,440 --> 00:19:12,240
ability

559
00:19:12,240 --> 00:19:15,280
to react to that in real time now you're

560
00:19:15,280 --> 00:19:15,679
not

561
00:19:15,679 --> 00:19:18,240
saddling them with outside processes

562
00:19:18,240 --> 00:19:19,760
that create friction

563
00:19:19,760 --> 00:19:23,120
that create these slow feedback loops

564
00:19:23,120 --> 00:19:25,280
that ultimately at the end of the day

565
00:19:25,280 --> 00:19:27,120
cause developers not to adopt the

566
00:19:27,120 --> 00:19:29,120
practices we want to do

567
00:19:29,120 --> 00:19:32,720
so go ahead oh sorry i was just saying

568
00:19:32,720 --> 00:19:33,280
not to

569
00:19:33,280 --> 00:19:34,640
provide counterpoint here but i just

570
00:19:34,640 --> 00:19:36,559
want to you know bolster that with a

571
00:19:36,559 --> 00:19:38,160
healthy dose of

572
00:19:38,160 --> 00:19:39,919
you know don't put all your eggs in one

573
00:19:39,919 --> 00:19:41,600
basket and realize that these

574
00:19:41,600 --> 00:19:43,760
integrations and these tools still

575
00:19:43,760 --> 00:19:46,000
require some some hand holding for

576
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:47,280
especially when you're kind of getting

577
00:19:47,280 --> 00:19:48,640
off your your feet you're going to need

578
00:19:48,640 --> 00:19:49,760
to

579
00:19:49,760 --> 00:19:51,919
work with dev teams and then again i'm

580
00:19:51,919 --> 00:19:53,360
speaking to security folks because

581
00:19:53,360 --> 00:19:55,120
that's that's where i come from you need

582
00:19:55,120 --> 00:19:57,440
to work the dev teams to understand

583
00:19:57,440 --> 00:19:59,679
uh maybe what these what these

584
00:19:59,679 --> 00:20:01,600
exploitable vulnerabilities are and how

585
00:20:01,600 --> 00:20:02,960
they manifest and

586
00:20:02,960 --> 00:20:04,480
what they look like because something

587
00:20:04,480 --> 00:20:06,400
like a sas

588
00:20:06,400 --> 00:20:08,240
tool is going to show you a very

589
00:20:08,240 --> 00:20:10,480
explicit you know piece of

590
00:20:10,480 --> 00:20:12,640
uh of the code and how we've signature

591
00:20:12,640 --> 00:20:14,320
matched that to a known vulnerable

592
00:20:14,320 --> 00:20:15,360
database but

593
00:20:15,360 --> 00:20:17,360
something like a das tool is going to

594
00:20:17,360 --> 00:20:19,280
show you how that vulnerability is

595
00:20:19,280 --> 00:20:20,159
manifested

596
00:20:20,159 --> 00:20:24,240
in http so again you may have to do some

597
00:20:24,240 --> 00:20:26,640
uh some some enablement for for your dev

598
00:20:26,640 --> 00:20:28,159
teams to kind of get this going and vice

599
00:20:28,159 --> 00:20:29,600
versa for the dev teams

600
00:20:29,600 --> 00:20:31,039
you may have to do some enabling on the

601
00:20:31,039 --> 00:20:33,679
security side but i think the point is

602
00:20:33,679 --> 00:20:36,400
with these tools they really make that

603
00:20:36,400 --> 00:20:37,600
whole process that

604
00:20:37,600 --> 00:20:41,039
whole cohesion process a lot easier

605
00:20:41,039 --> 00:20:43,600
exactly and that feeds perfectly into

606
00:20:43,600 --> 00:20:44,799
the last point

607
00:20:44,799 --> 00:20:47,760
i mentioned before kelsey hightower's

608
00:20:47,760 --> 00:20:48,480
tweet and

609
00:20:48,480 --> 00:20:50,960
how much i like the idea of the people

610
00:20:50,960 --> 00:20:52,480
and i also mentioned this idea of

611
00:20:52,480 --> 00:20:54,240
meeting them where they live

612
00:20:54,240 --> 00:20:57,520
when we're building a devsecops culture

613
00:20:57,520 --> 00:20:59,799
that is a culture of shared

614
00:20:59,799 --> 00:21:01,280
responsibility

615
00:21:01,280 --> 00:21:04,159
where everybody is responsible for every

616
00:21:04,159 --> 00:21:04,799
element

617
00:21:04,799 --> 00:21:07,600
of the pipeline we've we've put it out

618
00:21:07,600 --> 00:21:08,480
there

619
00:21:08,480 --> 00:21:11,520
there's plenty of noise being made about

620
00:21:11,520 --> 00:21:13,440
oh security is everybody's

621
00:21:13,440 --> 00:21:14,880
responsibility

622
00:21:14,880 --> 00:21:17,600
well what about dev isn't delivering

623
00:21:17,600 --> 00:21:18,880
code quick

624
00:21:18,880 --> 00:21:21,919
just as much a responsibility of the

625
00:21:21,919 --> 00:21:23,120
security

626
00:21:23,120 --> 00:21:26,960
practices as it is the dev practices

627
00:21:26,960 --> 00:21:31,679
isn't delivering stable infrastructure

628
00:21:31,679 --> 00:21:33,440
that's on the developers and the

629
00:21:33,440 --> 00:21:35,200
security team as much as it is on

630
00:21:35,200 --> 00:21:37,600
anybody that has an ops discipline

631
00:21:37,600 --> 00:21:40,240
and so what we need to start creating is

632
00:21:40,240 --> 00:21:41,440
this culture where

633
00:21:41,440 --> 00:21:44,400
we all understand that devsec and ops

634
00:21:44,400 --> 00:21:46,000
are responsible for

635
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:49,120
devsecond ops that shared responsibility

636
00:21:49,120 --> 00:21:50,960
sure you've got people

637
00:21:50,960 --> 00:21:53,039
who are very specialized in development

638
00:21:53,039 --> 00:21:55,120
and that's their key focus you've got

639
00:21:55,120 --> 00:21:57,360
the security team who's very focused and

640
00:21:57,360 --> 00:21:58,960
has that niche knowledge

641
00:21:58,960 --> 00:22:01,919
and you've got the ops folks but how do

642
00:22:01,919 --> 00:22:03,440
we start to drive

643
00:22:03,440 --> 00:22:06,480
more of that mutual empathy not just

644
00:22:06,480 --> 00:22:08,240
not just the security team having

645
00:22:08,240 --> 00:22:10,000
empathy for developers which

646
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:13,679
is lacking for sure but how do we also

647
00:22:13,679 --> 00:22:16,960
get developers to have that same level

648
00:22:16,960 --> 00:22:18,960
of empathy for the security team

649
00:22:18,960 --> 00:22:21,200
so a couple ideas here the first is

650
00:22:21,200 --> 00:22:23,280
doing a walk a mile in their shoes

651
00:22:23,280 --> 00:22:24,080
program

652
00:22:24,080 --> 00:22:26,880
really tying your the various

653
00:22:26,880 --> 00:22:28,080
disciplines together

654
00:22:28,080 --> 00:22:30,720
and bringing them into a mutual

655
00:22:30,720 --> 00:22:32,000
engagement where

656
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:34,240
their daily activities are tied together

657
00:22:34,240 --> 00:22:35,679
they're in the same meetings they're

658
00:22:35,679 --> 00:22:38,080
going to the same stand-ups

659
00:22:38,080 --> 00:22:40,640
and then we've already mentioned from a

660
00:22:40,640 --> 00:22:42,000
tools perspective

661
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:45,440
paving that road make it easy to get

662
00:22:45,440 --> 00:22:49,520
code from the backlog to production

663
00:22:49,520 --> 00:22:52,640
but do it securely and stable yeah and

664
00:22:52,640 --> 00:22:54,799
you know some some operational tips here

665
00:22:54,799 --> 00:22:56,159
like it says up there

666
00:22:56,159 --> 00:22:58,559
um when you are selecting your security

667
00:22:58,559 --> 00:23:00,720
tools involve your dev department i mean

668
00:23:00,720 --> 00:23:02,480
again for some folks that's an obvious

669
00:23:02,480 --> 00:23:03,600
one but

670
00:23:03,600 --> 00:23:05,440
you should definitely have their buy-in

671
00:23:05,440 --> 00:23:07,520
you should uh at least help them

672
00:23:07,520 --> 00:23:08,480
understand

673
00:23:08,480 --> 00:23:11,520
um you know what these uh what these

674
00:23:11,520 --> 00:23:13,440
initiatives or approaches are gonna do

675
00:23:13,440 --> 00:23:15,200
how they're gonna augment or i mean

676
00:23:15,200 --> 00:23:16,799
let's face it change the development

677
00:23:16,799 --> 00:23:18,080
life cycle and

678
00:23:18,080 --> 00:23:21,120
um what the results are gonna be um

679
00:23:21,120 --> 00:23:24,400
security folks go to a dev stand-up just

680
00:23:24,400 --> 00:23:25,840
just start attending those meetings i

681
00:23:25,840 --> 00:23:28,000
mean you know maybe ask first but

682
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:30,320
you know show up and and and listen and

683
00:23:30,320 --> 00:23:31,760
and you know don't be a know-it-all

684
00:23:31,760 --> 00:23:33,039
don't try to be

685
00:23:33,039 --> 00:23:35,280
security you know person in the in in

686
00:23:35,280 --> 00:23:37,120
the the meeting but just sit there and

687
00:23:37,120 --> 00:23:38,480
try to understand and get used to the

688
00:23:38,480 --> 00:23:40,960
nomenclature and i and same thing for

689
00:23:40,960 --> 00:23:42,159
dev folks come and

690
00:23:42,159 --> 00:23:44,320
join our security stand-ups and and try

691
00:23:44,320 --> 00:23:45,520
to understand

692
00:23:45,520 --> 00:23:48,320
um maybe where we're coming from and and

693
00:23:48,320 --> 00:23:50,320
just a little bit of that uh you know

694
00:23:50,320 --> 00:23:52,400
bridges built from from both sides

695
00:23:52,400 --> 00:23:57,200
uh it helps out a ton absolutely

696
00:23:57,200 --> 00:24:00,320
so i know it's a short talk today not

697
00:24:00,320 --> 00:24:02,880
you know a little 25 minute slot here

698
00:24:02,880 --> 00:24:04,400
but definitely appreciate

699
00:24:04,400 --> 00:24:07,600
you all coming and joining us for this

700
00:24:07,600 --> 00:24:09,840
certainly open to continuing the

701
00:24:09,840 --> 00:24:12,000
conversation uh both of our contact

i'm always happy to have these

709
00:24:26,640 --> 00:24:29,440
conversations

710
00:24:31,120 --> 00:24:33,440
all right well thank you for that talk

711
00:24:33,440 --> 00:24:34,880
um we

712
00:24:34,880 --> 00:24:37,679
we do have a couple of questions a

713
00:24:37,679 --> 00:24:39,120
couple of them are by me because i was

714
00:24:39,120 --> 00:24:40,720
sitting there taking notes like yeah

715
00:24:40,720 --> 00:24:42,000
yeah

716
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:43,679
that's what i'm talking about um

717
00:24:43,679 --> 00:24:46,159
security people talking about devs

718
00:24:46,159 --> 00:24:49,600
fights yes let's do this

719
00:24:49,600 --> 00:24:52,159
right i'm pumped um first question do

720
00:24:52,159 --> 00:24:54,159
you have any recommendations on modern

721
00:24:54,159 --> 00:24:57,440
books about securing code

722
00:24:57,919 --> 00:25:00,960
boy oh that's a tough one um

723
00:25:00,960 --> 00:25:03,120
actually for modern books i can't say

724
00:25:03,120 --> 00:25:04,640
that i specifically do i know there's a

725
00:25:04,640 --> 00:25:05,919
number of them out there i can think of

726
00:25:05,919 --> 00:25:07,279
a few publishers

727
00:25:07,279 --> 00:25:10,480
who do really good work in that area um

728
00:25:10,480 --> 00:25:12,559
you know i mean manning and wiley are

729
00:25:12,559 --> 00:25:13,520
two that come

730
00:25:13,520 --> 00:25:16,400
right to mind who are doing a lot of

731
00:25:16,400 --> 00:25:18,559
books right now focused on

732
00:25:18,559 --> 00:25:20,960
uh not just learning code but learning

733
00:25:20,960 --> 00:25:23,039
code securely and so forth i don't i

734
00:25:23,039 --> 00:25:24,559
don't have a specific title though i

735
00:25:24,559 --> 00:25:26,000
apologize

736
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:28,159
um maybe not secure coding because again

737
00:25:28,159 --> 00:25:29,760
that's that's not the perspective i come

738
00:25:29,760 --> 00:25:30,640
from but

739
00:25:30,640 --> 00:25:33,120
uh definitely devsecops the phoenix

740
00:25:33,120 --> 00:25:33,760
project

741
00:25:33,760 --> 00:25:37,039
is a must-read uh it is awesome it is

742
00:25:37,039 --> 00:25:38,240
about a

743
00:25:38,240 --> 00:25:40,559
fictional company and if you uh read the

744
00:25:40,559 --> 00:25:41,919
book you'll you'll know what i'm talking

745
00:25:41,919 --> 00:25:43,120
about

746
00:25:43,120 --> 00:25:44,960
but it's awesome it really talks about

747
00:25:44,960 --> 00:25:46,559
um the evolution

748
00:25:46,559 --> 00:25:49,360
of integrating security into development

749
00:25:49,360 --> 00:25:50,799
kind of the trials and tribulations

750
00:25:50,799 --> 00:25:52,159
lessons learned because again

751
00:25:52,159 --> 00:25:54,400
that's the unfortunate side of it is

752
00:25:54,400 --> 00:25:55,440
it's a change

753
00:25:55,440 --> 00:25:58,559
and change is sometimes fraught with

754
00:25:58,559 --> 00:26:02,159
lessons learned yep absolutely

755
00:26:02,159 --> 00:26:04,960
um do you feel like the tooling has

756
00:26:04,960 --> 00:26:05,760
gotten better

757
00:26:05,760 --> 00:26:07,600
becoming more accessible and i think the

758
00:26:07,600 --> 00:26:09,039
quintessential example

759
00:26:09,039 --> 00:26:11,440
the question we gave was licensing costs

760
00:26:11,440 --> 00:26:12,880
prohibiting widespread usage and

761
00:26:12,880 --> 00:26:14,480
adoption right so it's like ah we can

762
00:26:14,480 --> 00:26:16,159
secure this pipeline but not this

763
00:26:16,159 --> 00:26:17,360
pipeline because

764
00:26:17,360 --> 00:26:20,240
we don't have the budget yeah so that

765
00:26:20,240 --> 00:26:21,600
that's a really good point right there's

766
00:26:21,600 --> 00:26:23,279
two questions that you actually asked in

767
00:26:23,279 --> 00:26:24,720
there one i think the

768
00:26:24,720 --> 00:26:26,320
the tooling is definitely becoming more

769
00:26:26,320 --> 00:26:28,240
accessible um

770
00:26:28,240 --> 00:26:31,679
you know but there's also a lot of

771
00:26:31,679 --> 00:26:33,919
niche point products out there and so

772
00:26:33,919 --> 00:26:35,600
figuring out you know which ones

773
00:26:35,600 --> 00:26:38,000
fit best into your pipeline what we're

774
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:39,360
really seeing though that's really nice

775
00:26:39,360 --> 00:26:40,400
is there's a lot

776
00:26:40,400 --> 00:26:43,120
of uh different vendors out there now

777
00:26:43,120 --> 00:26:45,039
who have community editions that are

778
00:26:45,039 --> 00:26:46,000
available

779
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:48,159
um you know not to toot any horns but i

780
00:26:48,159 --> 00:26:49,679
happen to work for one right

781
00:26:49,679 --> 00:26:53,039
um so you know

782
00:26:53,039 --> 00:26:55,120
there we're seeing more and more of that

783
00:26:55,120 --> 00:26:57,279
i think the other thing

784
00:26:57,279 --> 00:26:59,120
uh that we're going to start to see more

785
00:26:59,120 --> 00:27:01,520
of and it's really become a focus are

786
00:27:01,520 --> 00:27:03,039
these

787
00:27:03,039 --> 00:27:05,520
these devsecops tools that really come

788
00:27:05,520 --> 00:27:07,440
at it from a developer perspective

789
00:27:07,440 --> 00:27:09,520
again you know i can sit here and talk

790
00:27:09,520 --> 00:27:11,360
about sneak all day long of course but

791
00:27:11,360 --> 00:27:12,559
this isn't a sales

792
00:27:12,559 --> 00:27:14,799
pitch there are others too that we think

793
00:27:14,799 --> 00:27:16,559
about a lot of those logos you saw up

794
00:27:16,559 --> 00:27:17,760
there that are in those

795
00:27:17,760 --> 00:27:20,640
pipelines a lot of them are starting to

796
00:27:20,640 --> 00:27:22,240
address this now not just

797
00:27:22,240 --> 00:27:24,720
from a security perspective but from how

798
00:27:24,720 --> 00:27:25,440
do we create

799
00:27:25,440 --> 00:27:27,919
tools that developers actually want to

800
00:27:27,919 --> 00:27:29,200
use

801
00:27:29,200 --> 00:27:31,360
yeah and you know working for a vendor

802
00:27:31,360 --> 00:27:32,480
that also produces

803
00:27:32,480 --> 00:27:35,120
uh open source software metasploit right

804
00:27:35,120 --> 00:27:36,080
for that

805
00:27:36,080 --> 00:27:39,200
um you know it's it's kind of both sides

806
00:27:39,200 --> 00:27:39,840
of the coin

807
00:27:39,840 --> 00:27:43,840
um i would say to answer this question

808
00:27:43,840 --> 00:27:46,880
we see these kind of operations side of

809
00:27:46,880 --> 00:27:47,679
security

810
00:27:47,679 --> 00:27:50,480
moving to more of an operations team and

811
00:27:50,480 --> 00:27:52,320
maybe the

812
00:27:52,320 --> 00:27:55,760
security process enables and creation

813
00:27:55,760 --> 00:27:58,240
moving to more of a concentrated infosec

814
00:27:58,240 --> 00:28:00,640
team at least in these devsecops models

815
00:28:00,640 --> 00:28:01,440
where

816
00:28:01,440 --> 00:28:05,200
these tools can't be so security focused

817
00:28:05,200 --> 00:28:06,720
kind of like we're talking about meeting

818
00:28:06,720 --> 00:28:07,919
people in the middle and being just a

819
00:28:07,919 --> 00:28:08,559
little bit more

820
00:28:08,559 --> 00:28:11,840
usable across the board so um some folks

821
00:28:11,840 --> 00:28:13,440
would say they're becoming easier to use

822
00:28:13,440 --> 00:28:14,320
i don't think so i think they're

823
00:28:14,320 --> 00:28:16,320
becoming more streamlined because we're

824
00:28:16,320 --> 00:28:17,120
able to make

825
00:28:17,120 --> 00:28:18,880
maybe a little bit more assumptions with

826
00:28:18,880 --> 00:28:20,320
uh the configuration

827
00:28:20,320 --> 00:28:22,720
of things like you know integrations or

828
00:28:22,720 --> 00:28:24,240
you know app scans or something like

829
00:28:24,240 --> 00:28:25,760
that

830
00:28:25,760 --> 00:28:28,640
but i will say that some vendors aren't

831
00:28:28,640 --> 00:28:30,240
aren't thinking in the right

832
00:28:30,240 --> 00:28:31,840
way as far as how the products are

833
00:28:31,840 --> 00:28:34,320
licensed um but you know a good vendor

834
00:28:34,320 --> 00:28:37,200
will listen to their customer base and

835
00:28:37,200 --> 00:28:38,159
make changes

836
00:28:38,159 --> 00:28:41,200
to to better suit their use cases

837
00:28:41,200 --> 00:28:43,360
awesome all right well we're out of time

838
00:28:43,360 --> 00:28:44,799
but the next session's mine and the

839
00:28:44,799 --> 00:28:46,240
questions are mine so i'm going to go

840
00:28:46,240 --> 00:28:48,880
ahead and ask it

841
00:28:48,960 --> 00:28:50,880
uh does product own part of the security

842
00:28:50,880 --> 00:28:52,240
posture since they are typically

843
00:28:52,240 --> 00:28:55,760
prioritizing the backlog

844
00:28:55,760 --> 00:28:58,320
garrett knows that i love this question

845
00:28:58,320 --> 00:28:59,200
because yes

846
00:28:59,200 --> 00:29:01,200
i am all about threat modeling so i

847
00:29:01,200 --> 00:29:03,120
mentioned threat modeling in the backlog

848
00:29:03,120 --> 00:29:04,159
before

849
00:29:04,159 --> 00:29:06,399
that i've actually in other talks used

850
00:29:06,399 --> 00:29:07,919
the term and i hate myself for saying it

851
00:29:07,919 --> 00:29:09,559
but i'm going to say it again

852
00:29:09,559 --> 00:29:11,360
bizdevsecops i really don't want to get

853
00:29:11,360 --> 00:29:12,960
in the business of just continuing to

854
00:29:12,960 --> 00:29:15,120
grow that terminology but

855
00:29:15,120 --> 00:29:17,520
but really bringing business into this

856
00:29:17,520 --> 00:29:18,720
is crucial

857
00:29:18,720 --> 00:29:21,120
having the product team be a part of

858
00:29:21,120 --> 00:29:22,159
early on

859
00:29:22,159 --> 00:29:24,559
they're the ones writing that user story

860
00:29:24,559 --> 00:29:26,000
they're the ones that understand okay

861
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:27,919
what is actually most important in this

862
00:29:27,919 --> 00:29:29,279
application what are the

863
00:29:29,279 --> 00:29:30,720
critical assets the critical

864
00:29:30,720 --> 00:29:33,520
functionality and speak to that in terms

865
00:29:33,520 --> 00:29:34,720
of business impact

866
00:29:34,720 --> 00:29:36,880
you know you think about threat modeling

867
00:29:36,880 --> 00:29:39,440
with like stride and dread and all these

868
00:29:39,440 --> 00:29:41,039
frameworks they're great but they're so

869
00:29:41,039 --> 00:29:42,640
technically focused

870
00:29:42,640 --> 00:29:45,600
they lack context and so you know being

871
00:29:45,600 --> 00:29:46,399
able to bring

872
00:29:46,399 --> 00:29:49,919
that stronger context up this is what

873
00:29:49,919 --> 00:29:51,919
this threat means in terms of our

874
00:29:51,919 --> 00:29:53,279
business and in terms of this

875
00:29:53,279 --> 00:29:54,799
application

876
00:29:54,799 --> 00:29:57,120
and making that a part of the user story

877
00:29:57,120 --> 00:29:59,039
now you can rely on well-trained and

878
00:29:59,039 --> 00:30:00,480
especially your senior developers and

879
00:30:00,480 --> 00:30:02,320
architects to say all right because of

880
00:30:02,320 --> 00:30:04,960
that we have to have these controls

881
00:30:04,960 --> 00:30:06,640
well you can draw a parallel to just

882
00:30:06,640 --> 00:30:08,320
regular security i mean you need to have

883
00:30:08,320 --> 00:30:09,679
different perspectives to really make it

884
00:30:09,679 --> 00:30:11,360
work

885
00:30:11,360 --> 00:30:13,679
awesome all right well we got to cut it

886
00:30:13,679 --> 00:30:14,559
