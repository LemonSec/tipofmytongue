1
00:00:00,350 --> 00:00:05,160
so next up is a talk from Julie Anderson

2
00:00:05,160 --> 00:00:08,849
and it's a pre-recorded talk by Julie so

3
00:00:08,849 --> 00:00:30,210
I'm going to start that hi I'm Julie

4
00:00:30,210 --> 00:00:32,969
Gunderson and I'm here today to talk

5
00:00:32,969 --> 00:00:36,750
about how you can't buy DevOps just a

6
00:00:36,750 --> 00:00:38,879
little bit about me I'm from Boise Idaho

7
00:00:38,879 --> 00:00:41,520
I'm a DevOps advocate at pager duty an

8
00:00:41,520 --> 00:00:43,920
organizer of DevOps days Boise an

9
00:00:43,920 --> 00:00:46,440
organizer of delivery comm and the

10
00:00:46,440 --> 00:00:48,750
community correspondent at open source

11
00:00:48,750 --> 00:00:52,079
calm as I noted I live in Idaho which is

12
00:00:52,079 --> 00:00:55,110
not Ohio or Iowa which oftentimes gets

13
00:00:55,110 --> 00:00:59,640
confused and I'm very excited to be here

14
00:00:59,640 --> 00:01:02,190
with you today to talk about all of the

15
00:01:02,190 --> 00:01:05,549
reasons you can't buy DevOps so our

16
00:01:05,549 --> 00:01:07,770
systems are increasingly complex which

17
00:01:07,770 --> 00:01:10,110
drives the need for DevOps and digital

18
00:01:10,110 --> 00:01:12,420
businesses today they're always on and

19
00:01:12,420 --> 00:01:14,430
innovating but with innovation comes

20
00:01:14,430 --> 00:01:17,009
challenges and expectations and a

21
00:01:17,009 --> 00:01:19,020
digital transformation is the top of

22
00:01:19,020 --> 00:01:22,170
mind for most CEOs because it's

23
00:01:22,170 --> 00:01:24,659
imperative the organizations remain

24
00:01:24,659 --> 00:01:26,520
relevant today

25
00:01:26,520 --> 00:01:28,650
so in the beauty state of digital

26
00:01:28,650 --> 00:01:31,799
operations report in 2017 we showed that

27
00:01:31,799 --> 00:01:34,020
when a digital app or service is

28
00:01:34,020 --> 00:01:36,210
unresponsible unresponsive or slow

29
00:01:36,210 --> 00:01:38,430
eighty six point six percent of

30
00:01:38,430 --> 00:01:40,290
consumers said that they would likely

31
00:01:40,290 --> 00:01:43,170
temporarily switch to an alternative

32
00:01:43,170 --> 00:01:47,009
mobile app and with that sixty eight

33
00:01:47,009 --> 00:01:48,570
percent of respondents said that they

34
00:01:48,570 --> 00:01:50,880
would likely never use the app or

35
00:01:50,880 --> 00:01:53,640
website again because today connected

36
00:01:53,640 --> 00:01:56,700
customers expect a seamless digital

37
00:01:56,700 --> 00:01:59,939
experience all the time every time and

38
00:01:59,939 --> 00:02:02,490
systems will neva tably fail and when

39
00:02:02,490 --> 00:02:04,890
they do it takes you time to recover and

40
00:02:04,890 --> 00:02:05,700
that's the difference between

41
00:02:05,700 --> 00:02:08,610
competitive advantage and market failure

42
00:02:08,610 --> 00:02:11,220
so to survive in the digital world you

43
00:02:11,220 --> 00:02:13,120
must ensure the lowest

44
00:02:13,120 --> 00:02:15,069
well time to restoring services by

45
00:02:15,069 --> 00:02:17,470
empowering engineers to own the services

46
00:02:17,470 --> 00:02:20,080
and systems that they use in production

47
00:02:20,080 --> 00:02:22,239
and whether it's an individual

48
00:02:22,239 --> 00:02:24,480
contributor or an organizational shift

49
00:02:24,480 --> 00:02:26,470
introducing new practices and

50
00:02:26,470 --> 00:02:29,440
organizations it's hard and it's really

51
00:02:29,440 --> 00:02:31,690
key to understand how people and

52
00:02:31,690 --> 00:02:35,140
organizations process change as well as

53
00:02:35,140 --> 00:02:37,090
understanding that accepting change

54
00:02:37,090 --> 00:02:39,909
doesn't happen overnight and it's really

55
00:02:39,909 --> 00:02:42,489
important to align the business outcomes

56
00:02:42,489 --> 00:02:45,910
the key values and expectations along

57
00:02:45,910 --> 00:02:49,150
with frequent communication to see those

58
00:02:49,150 --> 00:02:51,840
changes occur so when we talk about

59
00:02:51,840 --> 00:02:54,700
DevOps a lot of people think that it has

60
00:02:54,700 --> 00:02:57,549
to be mandated from a top-down model but

61
00:02:57,549 --> 00:02:59,890
the bottoms up model really works

62
00:02:59,890 --> 00:03:02,680
because you have the buy-in and the

63
00:03:02,680 --> 00:03:04,870
investment from the people that are

64
00:03:04,870 --> 00:03:07,209
doing the work and when you see that

65
00:03:07,209 --> 00:03:09,250
happens it can infect the rest of your

66
00:03:09,250 --> 00:03:14,260
organization so a quick google search of

67
00:03:14,260 --> 00:03:16,569
the definition of DevOps who returned

68
00:03:16,569 --> 00:03:19,870
quite a few results and I had recently

69
00:03:19,870 --> 00:03:22,030
asked Patrick Dubois if he would give me

70
00:03:22,030 --> 00:03:24,430
a definition of DevOps when we heard a

71
00:03:24,430 --> 00:03:26,940
bob stays Kent and he said he wouldn't

72
00:03:26,940 --> 00:03:29,169
because DevOps is different to each

73
00:03:29,169 --> 00:03:31,780
organization so some of the definitions

74
00:03:31,780 --> 00:03:33,819
that I like to look at are that DevOps

75
00:03:33,819 --> 00:03:35,859
is a set of practices that combine

76
00:03:35,859 --> 00:03:38,190
software development and information

77
00:03:38,190 --> 00:03:40,510
technology operations which aims to

78
00:03:40,510 --> 00:03:42,160
shorten the systems development

79
00:03:42,160 --> 00:03:44,500
lifecycle and provide continuous

80
00:03:44,500 --> 00:03:47,280
delivery with high quality software

81
00:03:47,280 --> 00:03:50,349
there's other definitions of DevOps as

82
00:03:50,349 --> 00:03:53,560
well it's a word that's used to describe

83
00:03:53,560 --> 00:03:56,590
a saturday-night practices which seek to

84
00:03:56,590 --> 00:03:58,510
more closely bring together software

85
00:03:58,510 --> 00:04:01,030
developers and operation staff to work

86
00:04:01,030 --> 00:04:02,410
on the same project in the more

87
00:04:02,410 --> 00:04:04,870
collaborative manner or it's a

88
00:04:04,870 --> 00:04:06,970
combination of cultural philosophies

89
00:04:06,970 --> 00:04:09,040
practices and tools that increases an

90
00:04:09,040 --> 00:04:10,629
organization's ability to deliver

91
00:04:10,629 --> 00:04:13,000
applications and services at high

92
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:16,358
velocity evolving and improving products

93
00:04:16,358 --> 00:04:18,399
at a faster pace than organizations

94
00:04:18,399 --> 00:04:20,440
using traditional software development

95
00:04:20,440 --> 00:04:22,530
and infrastructure management practices

96
00:04:22,530 --> 00:04:25,599
the point is is that's collaborative

97
00:04:25,599 --> 00:04:27,280
it's

98
00:04:27,280 --> 00:04:31,360
it's people over processes so I recently

99
00:04:31,360 --> 00:04:34,449
took some DevOps self-assessments and I

100
00:04:34,449 --> 00:04:37,139
tried to answer as if I was the perfect

101
00:04:37,139 --> 00:04:40,330
organization and with the exception of

102
00:04:40,330 --> 00:04:43,060
the Microsoft DevOps self-assessment the

103
00:04:43,060 --> 00:04:44,680
rest of the ones that I took tried to

104
00:04:44,680 --> 00:04:48,009
push me to buy a product their product

105
00:04:48,009 --> 00:04:50,080
would solve all of my DevOps needs I

106
00:04:50,080 --> 00:04:51,789
just needed to talk to one of their

107
00:04:51,789 --> 00:04:54,520
sales person in just ten simple

108
00:04:54,520 --> 00:04:57,250
questions they could tell me where I was

109
00:04:57,250 --> 00:05:00,039
on my journey the assessment that I

110
00:05:00,039 --> 00:05:02,229
found that I really liked was a DevOps

111
00:05:02,229 --> 00:05:04,539
assessment dotnet one of the reasons

112
00:05:04,539 --> 00:05:06,699
that I liked this assessment was because

113
00:05:06,699 --> 00:05:11,050
it gave me links and resources and

114
00:05:11,050 --> 00:05:13,960
reading to really understand where my

115
00:05:13,960 --> 00:05:16,599
organization maybe fell short and what

116
00:05:16,599 --> 00:05:19,470
areas of improvement we could have

117
00:05:19,470 --> 00:05:22,360
because at the end of the day you can't

118
00:05:22,360 --> 00:05:25,419
purchase culture with a credit card you

119
00:05:25,419 --> 00:05:27,759
have to actually invest in people and

120
00:05:27,759 --> 00:05:30,909
processes and tools and you can't buy

121
00:05:30,909 --> 00:05:34,150
your way or label your way into DevOps

122
00:05:34,150 --> 00:05:38,110
so what is DevOps with all the options

123
00:05:38,110 --> 00:05:40,659
where do you start let's talk about what

124
00:05:40,659 --> 00:05:43,930
DevOps is not DevOps is not moving to

125
00:05:43,930 --> 00:05:46,210
the cloud yes being part of the cloud

126
00:05:46,210 --> 00:05:48,460
can be part of DevOps but just because

127
00:05:48,460 --> 00:05:49,930
you've moved to the cloud doesn't make

128
00:05:49,930 --> 00:05:52,539
you at the Bob scream is a ssin DevOps

129
00:05:52,539 --> 00:05:56,169
is not a team of siloed people way off

130
00:05:56,169 --> 00:05:58,659
on an island on their own away from the

131
00:05:58,659 --> 00:06:01,719
rest of the organization DevOps is not

132
00:06:01,719 --> 00:06:06,009
doing away with the ops team and DevOps

133
00:06:06,009 --> 00:06:09,669
is not a prescriptive checklist from the

134
00:06:09,669 --> 00:06:12,340
accelerate state of DevOps report one of

135
00:06:12,340 --> 00:06:13,419
the things that they say as many

136
00:06:13,419 --> 00:06:15,699
organizations wanting to adopt DevOps

137
00:06:15,699 --> 00:06:17,830
look for a set of prescriptive steps or

138
00:06:17,830 --> 00:06:19,630
best practices to guide their journey

139
00:06:19,630 --> 00:06:23,020
however every organization is different

140
00:06:23,020 --> 00:06:25,930
and which practices to adopt it depends

141
00:06:25,930 --> 00:06:28,050
on the current state of the organization

142
00:06:28,050 --> 00:06:30,069
including the state of its technology

143
00:06:30,069 --> 00:06:34,810
culture and processes and in short long

144
00:06:34,810 --> 00:06:36,419
term goals

145
00:06:36,419 --> 00:06:39,300
you can't just click a button

146
00:06:39,300 --> 00:06:41,849
DevOps isn't just downloadable it's not

147
00:06:41,849 --> 00:06:45,990
that easy but let's talk about some of

148
00:06:45,990 --> 00:06:47,879
the things that are behind DevOps and

149
00:06:47,879 --> 00:06:48,860
what it is

150
00:06:48,860 --> 00:06:52,530
DevOps is really people over processes

151
00:06:52,530 --> 00:06:54,930
and culture and there are many types of

152
00:06:54,930 --> 00:06:57,120
culture within DevOps we're going to

153
00:06:57,120 --> 00:07:00,389
reference the westrom cultural model the

154
00:07:00,389 --> 00:07:03,539
accelerate science of DevOps report by

155
00:07:03,539 --> 00:07:05,669
Nicole foras grand jazz humble and Jean

156
00:07:05,669 --> 00:07:08,250
Kent is a great place to start and one

157
00:07:08,250 --> 00:07:09,659
of the things that they talk about is

158
00:07:09,659 --> 00:07:11,849
the Western cultural model so Ron

159
00:07:11,849 --> 00:07:14,190
westrom was an American sociologist and

160
00:07:14,190 --> 00:07:15,690
he defines the culture within

161
00:07:15,690 --> 00:07:18,270
organizations as the patterned way that

162
00:07:18,270 --> 00:07:20,129
an organization responds to its

163
00:07:20,129 --> 00:07:22,740
challenges whether these are explicit or

164
00:07:22,740 --> 00:07:26,099
implicit so pathological is really a

165
00:07:26,099 --> 00:07:29,669
fear-based organization information is

166
00:07:29,669 --> 00:07:33,030
power it's held very closely whereas a

167
00:07:33,030 --> 00:07:35,780
bureaucratic model aligns more with

168
00:07:35,780 --> 00:07:39,990
department or role oriented so it's my

169
00:07:39,990 --> 00:07:42,960
turf and your turf my lane your lane

170
00:07:42,960 --> 00:07:45,330
very very process-oriented

171
00:07:45,330 --> 00:07:47,849
this is a culture you'll often times see

172
00:07:47,849 --> 00:07:49,620
in finance or government organizations

173
00:07:49,620 --> 00:07:52,409
due to regulation but then when we get

174
00:07:52,409 --> 00:07:54,569
to the generative model that's where

175
00:07:54,569 --> 00:07:56,279
we're talking about everybody being

176
00:07:56,279 --> 00:07:59,639
aligned to the mission or the outcome of

177
00:07:59,639 --> 00:08:01,680
the organization and those generative

178
00:08:01,680 --> 00:08:04,770
cultures they really empower people to

179
00:08:04,770 --> 00:08:08,550
ask questions to share ideas to think of

180
00:08:08,550 --> 00:08:11,310
new ways of doing things to learn from

181
00:08:11,310 --> 00:08:14,159
failure and so let's talk a little bit

182
00:08:14,159 --> 00:08:16,409
about how we get there

183
00:08:16,409 --> 00:08:19,279
Google did a two-year research study on

184
00:08:19,279 --> 00:08:21,529
high-performing teams and they found

185
00:08:21,529 --> 00:08:24,599
these five things that psychological

186
00:08:24,599 --> 00:08:27,960
safety was the number one element of

187
00:08:27,960 --> 00:08:30,270
high-performing teams where can we take

188
00:08:30,270 --> 00:08:32,070
risks on this team without feeling

189
00:08:32,070 --> 00:08:34,349
insecure embarrassed and dependability

190
00:08:34,349 --> 00:08:36,510
can we count on each other to do high

191
00:08:36,510 --> 00:08:38,940
quality work on time I'm is their

192
00:08:38,940 --> 00:08:41,309
structure and clarity our goals and

193
00:08:41,309 --> 00:08:44,640
bowls and execution plans to the team

194
00:08:44,640 --> 00:08:48,240
clear is there meaning of work is it

195
00:08:48,240 --> 00:08:50,160
something that's personally important to

196
00:08:50,160 --> 00:08:53,170
each of us and do we understand the M

197
00:08:53,170 --> 00:08:55,570
act of our work do we believe that the

198
00:08:55,570 --> 00:08:58,029
work that we're doing matters and so

199
00:08:58,029 --> 00:09:00,519
when you look at these findings on

200
00:09:00,519 --> 00:09:03,070
high-performing teams it's another area

201
00:09:03,070 --> 00:09:06,700
where you see DevOps thrive when we look

202
00:09:06,700 --> 00:09:08,470
at the generative model based on the

203
00:09:08,470 --> 00:09:10,180
mission the outcomes and the goals of

204
00:09:10,180 --> 00:09:12,459
the organization's when those missions

205
00:09:12,459 --> 00:09:15,279
are shared and individuals and teams

206
00:09:15,279 --> 00:09:18,670
work together you see the bridging you

207
00:09:18,670 --> 00:09:21,040
see that collaboration and that sharing

208
00:09:21,040 --> 00:09:23,320
of information and keeping that flowing

209
00:09:23,320 --> 00:09:26,470
which is considered critical to how

210
00:09:26,470 --> 00:09:28,180
organizations respond to problems

211
00:09:28,180 --> 00:09:30,370
including incidents and how quickly

212
00:09:30,370 --> 00:09:33,910
these incidents get resolved and you see

213
00:09:33,910 --> 00:09:36,339
them working together and innovating and

214
00:09:36,339 --> 00:09:37,899
what they're doing is they're putting

215
00:09:37,899 --> 00:09:40,510
that customer experience at the top of

216
00:09:40,510 --> 00:09:43,810
mind so that outcome or the mission of

217
00:09:43,810 --> 00:09:46,449
the company it's been communicated

218
00:09:46,449 --> 00:09:48,880
throughout the organization and people

219
00:09:48,880 --> 00:09:51,930
are bought into it

220
00:10:04,410 --> 00:10:06,469
you

221
00:10:24,030 --> 00:10:26,089
you

222
00:10:53,410 --> 00:10:55,469
you

223
00:11:25,040 --> 00:11:27,099
you

224
00:11:54,510 --> 00:11:56,569
you

225
00:11:57,830 --> 00:12:00,410
I'll Thunderbird pilot and when she

226
00:12:00,410 --> 00:12:02,630
talked about trust and psychological

227
00:12:02,630 --> 00:12:04,640
safety she talked about the fact that

228
00:12:04,640 --> 00:12:06,680
you have to have that trust and

229
00:12:06,680 --> 00:12:09,440
empowerment of your team to know that

230
00:12:09,440 --> 00:12:12,890
you have 300 feet of clearance on either

231
00:12:12,890 --> 00:12:15,290
side and up and down of your plane in

232
00:12:15,290 --> 00:12:17,230
order to make these formations work

233
00:12:17,230 --> 00:12:20,300
because psychological safety and not

234
00:12:20,300 --> 00:12:23,660
trust it extends to any organization and

235
00:12:23,660 --> 00:12:26,480
a culture that values psychological

236
00:12:26,480 --> 00:12:29,990
safety trust and respect contributes to

237
00:12:29,990 --> 00:12:32,660
productivity by letting employees focus

238
00:12:32,660 --> 00:12:35,120
on solving problems and getting their

239
00:12:35,120 --> 00:12:38,089
work done rather than politics and

240
00:12:38,089 --> 00:12:40,940
infighting which brings us back to that

241
00:12:40,940 --> 00:12:43,850
westrom model because fostering that

242
00:12:43,850 --> 00:12:46,339
blameless culture alleviates challenges

243
00:12:46,339 --> 00:12:49,510
associated with the ways of working

244
00:12:49,510 --> 00:12:52,940
again going back to the accelerate state

245
00:12:52,940 --> 00:12:56,209
of DevOps report Dora affirmed previous

246
00:12:56,209 --> 00:12:58,040
research done by Google on the effects

247
00:12:58,040 --> 00:12:59,690
of psychological and safety and

248
00:12:59,690 --> 00:13:02,000
performance they said that their

249
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:03,680
analysis found that this culture of

250
00:13:03,680 --> 00:13:06,410
psychological safety is predictive of

251
00:13:06,410 --> 00:13:08,620
software delivery performance

252
00:13:08,620 --> 00:13:10,399
organizational performance and

253
00:13:10,399 --> 00:13:12,920
productivity and these results indicate

254
00:13:12,920 --> 00:13:15,230
that teams of the culture of trust and

255
00:13:15,230 --> 00:13:17,870
psychological safety with meaningful

256
00:13:17,870 --> 00:13:20,660
work and clarity see significant

257
00:13:20,660 --> 00:13:24,740
benefits and you would want to embrace

258
00:13:24,740 --> 00:13:27,470
failure because being willing to fail

259
00:13:27,470 --> 00:13:30,740
and ask questions that's creating that

260
00:13:30,740 --> 00:13:34,459
learning organization Jay Paul Reid

261
00:13:34,459 --> 00:13:37,270
talks about

262
00:13:45,250 --> 00:13:47,310
you

263
00:14:06,380 --> 00:14:10,070
fraid they won't say anything they won't

264
00:14:10,070 --> 00:14:12,890
speak up and problems will get worse and

265
00:14:12,890 --> 00:14:15,320
let's talk a little bit about how words

266
00:14:15,320 --> 00:14:18,580
matter as well think of the words we use

267
00:14:18,580 --> 00:14:21,590
gonna get on my soapbox here when we

268
00:14:21,590 --> 00:14:23,780
talk about root cause versus

269
00:14:23,780 --> 00:14:26,420
contributing factors going back to the

270
00:14:26,420 --> 00:14:28,010
fact that systems are increasingly

271
00:14:28,010 --> 00:14:32,150
complex there is generally not one thing

272
00:14:32,150 --> 00:14:35,150
that causes failure it's a combination

273
00:14:35,150 --> 00:14:38,630
of things so if I was able to fat-finger

274
00:14:38,630 --> 00:14:42,290
code and take down a WS East was it just

275
00:14:42,290 --> 00:14:45,410
because I was able to do that or were

276
00:14:45,410 --> 00:14:47,780
there things not in place that prevented

277
00:14:47,780 --> 00:14:51,830
me from being able to take down all of a

278
00:14:51,830 --> 00:14:54,260
WS East we have to think of all of the

279
00:14:54,260 --> 00:14:56,360
contributing factors and just something

280
00:14:56,360 --> 00:14:58,100
to think about here if you're not

281
00:14:58,100 --> 00:15:00,350
currently practicing post-mortems in

282
00:15:00,350 --> 00:15:02,690
your organization that's one of the

283
00:15:02,690 --> 00:15:04,580
great ways to really delve deep into

284
00:15:04,580 --> 00:15:08,300
those contributing factors and that goes

285
00:15:08,300 --> 00:15:11,140
back to the failure leads to inquiry

286
00:15:11,140 --> 00:15:14,360
another thing that is really important

287
00:15:14,360 --> 00:15:17,920
are clear and simple defined processes

288
00:15:17,920 --> 00:15:21,770
make sure that you own your processes

289
00:15:21,770 --> 00:15:25,090
and that your processes don't own you

290
00:15:25,090 --> 00:15:28,130
understand why you have the processes in

291
00:15:28,130 --> 00:15:31,370
place that you have do they work are

292
00:15:31,370 --> 00:15:32,720
they too complex

293
00:15:32,720 --> 00:15:34,550
can there be things that are removed

294
00:15:34,550 --> 00:15:37,220
from these processes because long

295
00:15:37,220 --> 00:15:40,910
drawn-out processes do not help an

296
00:15:40,910 --> 00:15:44,180
organization from the accelerate state

297
00:15:44,180 --> 00:15:46,190
of DevOps report heavy weight change

298
00:15:46,190 --> 00:15:48,110
approval processes such as change

299
00:15:48,110 --> 00:15:50,870
approval boards negatively impact speed

300
00:15:50,870 --> 00:15:53,750
and stability in contrast having clearly

301
00:15:53,750 --> 00:15:55,970
understood processes for change

302
00:15:55,970 --> 00:15:59,540
it drives speed and stability as well as

303
00:15:59,540 --> 00:16:02,360
reductions in burnout and that's where

304
00:16:02,360 --> 00:16:06,680
you get that novelty implemented so when

305
00:16:06,680 --> 00:16:09,050
we talk about DevOps transformation I

306
00:16:09,050 --> 00:16:11,060
understand that this slide looks like a

307
00:16:11,060 --> 00:16:13,280
bit of a timeline and it's not intended

308
00:16:13,280 --> 00:16:16,640
to this can be really anywhere you are

309
00:16:16,640 --> 00:16:19,590
on your DevOps transformation journey

310
00:16:19,590 --> 00:16:21,330
but if your company says that a

311
00:16:21,330 --> 00:16:24,890
migration or a trip

312
00:16:44,320 --> 00:16:48,550
that 100% DevOps because it is a

313
00:16:48,550 --> 00:16:52,480
multi-year journey so there are

314
00:16:52,480 --> 00:16:54,280
different ways that we're thinking about

315
00:16:54,280 --> 00:16:56,740
DevOps you know is the release cycle a

316
00:16:56,740 --> 00:16:58,810
few times a year are you in a hybrid

317
00:16:58,810 --> 00:17:00,730
cycle where it's seven times several

318
00:17:00,730 --> 00:17:02,650
times a year or are you really in that

319
00:17:02,650 --> 00:17:05,920
release on demand if you're kind of in

320
00:17:05,920 --> 00:17:08,140
that thinking about DevOps model you may

321
00:17:08,140 --> 00:17:10,930
be very high ITIL heavy very NOC driven

322
00:17:10,930 --> 00:17:13,540
where we seed the hybrid model come in

323
00:17:13,540 --> 00:17:16,270
is we see that where organizations they

324
00:17:16,270 --> 00:17:18,609
essentially have two operating models

325
00:17:18,609 --> 00:17:20,410
within the same organization because

326
00:17:20,410 --> 00:17:22,839
they have some very ITIL heavy processes

327
00:17:22,839 --> 00:17:25,260
but they also have their DevOps

328
00:17:25,260 --> 00:17:27,220
processes as well that they've grown up

329
00:17:27,220 --> 00:17:28,930
with and now they're trying to function

330
00:17:28,930 --> 00:17:32,770
together and then some teams may be

331
00:17:32,770 --> 00:17:35,140
starting to adopt dev ops methodologies

332
00:17:35,140 --> 00:17:38,110
when you're thinking about it but your

333
00:17:38,110 --> 00:17:40,660
company DNA and primary operating model

334
00:17:40,660 --> 00:17:42,580
in that DevOps elite category that's

335
00:17:42,580 --> 00:17:46,510
where you really are and so again when

336
00:17:46,510 --> 00:17:47,890
we talk about continuous improvement

337
00:17:47,890 --> 00:17:50,260
when organizations that are really

338
00:17:50,260 --> 00:17:51,910
thinking about what does devops mean

339
00:17:51,910 --> 00:17:54,340
failure still leads to scapegoating I'm

340
00:17:54,340 --> 00:17:57,220
in those hybrid models failure leads to

341
00:17:57,220 --> 00:18:00,490
justice but in the DevOps elite models

342
00:18:00,490 --> 00:18:03,370
that failure that leads to inquiry and

343
00:18:03,370 --> 00:18:06,610
that leads to learning so let's talk

344
00:18:06,610 --> 00:18:09,700
about practices because discipline

345
00:18:09,700 --> 00:18:13,480
doesn't cost a dollar in configuration

346
00:18:13,480 --> 00:18:16,540
management you definitely want to have

347
00:18:16,540 --> 00:18:18,550
configuration management to properly

348
00:18:18,550 --> 00:18:20,800
Atum a configuration management it's

349
00:18:20,800 --> 00:18:23,170
important because it enables the ability

350
00:18:23,170 --> 00:18:24,820
to scale infrastructure and software

351
00:18:24,820 --> 00:18:28,120
systems configuration management it

352
00:18:28,120 --> 00:18:29,860
establishes and maintains the

353
00:18:29,860 --> 00:18:32,200
consistency of the system or the product

354
00:18:32,200 --> 00:18:34,360
throughout its lifetime and you can buy

355
00:18:34,360 --> 00:18:38,170
tools but if you don't implement config

356
00:18:38,170 --> 00:18:41,290
management across everything for the

357
00:18:41,290 --> 00:18:44,220
tools to be used correctly nothing is

358
00:18:44,220 --> 00:18:46,960
left to chance in these systems there's

359
00:18:46,960 --> 00:18:50,440
a lot that can go wrong and automate

360
00:18:50,440 --> 00:18:52,780
automate everything that can be

361
00:18:52,780 --> 00:18:55,870
automated because it enables the DevOps

362
00:18:55,870 --> 00:18:57,730
objective of that delivering

363
00:18:57,730 --> 00:19:00,970
that high-quality frequently releases

364
00:19:00,970 --> 00:19:04,180
fast releases it is investment its

365
00:19:04,180 --> 00:19:07,720
investment in the right tools anything

366
00:19:07,720 --> 00:19:10,690
that you can automate build test deploys

367
00:19:10,690 --> 00:19:12,700
all of that should be automated and you

368
00:19:12,700 --> 00:19:15,540
want to orchestrate these processes and

369
00:19:15,540 --> 00:19:19,000
tooling tooling is really important we

370
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:21,400
do have to have tools but it's about

371
00:19:21,400 --> 00:19:24,700
having useful tools and letting the

372
00:19:24,700 --> 00:19:28,360
teams who are using the tools decide on

373
00:19:28,360 --> 00:19:29,920
the tools that are being purchased

374
00:19:29,920 --> 00:19:33,030
because there isn't a one-size-fits-all

375
00:19:33,030 --> 00:19:36,220
here there's a lot of tools out there

376
00:19:36,220 --> 00:19:39,250
this is one of my favorite charts the

377
00:19:39,250 --> 00:19:42,790
periodic chart of tools by z-bo labs and

378
00:19:42,790 --> 00:19:44,950
I was recently speaking at a conference

379
00:19:44,950 --> 00:19:47,350
in New Zealand where somebody came up to

380
00:19:47,350 --> 00:19:49,540
me afterwards and says you know what we

381
00:19:49,540 --> 00:19:51,880
just if there's a tool we buy it we buy

382
00:19:51,880 --> 00:19:55,900
all the tools that doesn't actually help

383
00:19:55,900 --> 00:19:58,000
in your journey if the tools are not

384
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:01,810
being implemented in the right way by

385
00:20:01,810 --> 00:20:04,150
the right teams to their fullest

386
00:20:04,150 --> 00:20:08,710
capability also continuous integration

387
00:20:08,710 --> 00:20:11,650
you don't want to spend days or weeks

388
00:20:11,650 --> 00:20:14,110
which takes forever to integrate and

389
00:20:14,110 --> 00:20:17,110
make rollbacks hard deploys small chunks

390
00:20:17,110 --> 00:20:20,140
of code tests along the way live in

391
00:20:20,140 --> 00:20:22,540
short small branches where you can build

392
00:20:22,540 --> 00:20:25,120
the quality end because that allows for

393
00:20:25,120 --> 00:20:28,960
the continuous feedback loops and use

394
00:20:28,960 --> 00:20:31,090
the test-driven deployment methodology

395
00:20:31,090 --> 00:20:32,950
it's a software development process that

396
00:20:32,950 --> 00:20:35,200
relies on the repetition a very short

397
00:20:35,200 --> 00:20:38,230
development cycle requirements are

398
00:20:38,230 --> 00:20:41,110
turned into very specific test cases and

399
00:20:41,110 --> 00:20:42,760
then the software is improved to pass

400
00:20:42,760 --> 00:20:46,560
new tests only this is a great

401
00:20:46,560 --> 00:20:49,470
methodology for testing tests often

402
00:20:49,470 --> 00:20:52,110
automate your testing automate your

403
00:20:52,110 --> 00:20:55,120
regression testing testing should be run

404
00:20:55,120 --> 00:20:57,370
against every commit and because that

405
00:20:57,370 --> 00:21:00,760
ensures your reliability and your

406
00:21:00,760 --> 00:21:05,260
quality and also star small if you're in

407
00:21:05,260 --> 00:21:07,750
an organization that's considering

408
00:21:07,750 --> 00:21:10,540
adopting DevOps or really looking to

409
00:21:10,540 --> 00:21:11,320
move towards the

410
00:21:11,320 --> 00:21:14,200
they don't know where to go start with a

411
00:21:14,200 --> 00:21:17,020
small team start with the team who's

412
00:21:17,020 --> 00:21:20,260
working on a greenfield project start

413
00:21:20,260 --> 00:21:22,870
where you can show and prove out success

414
00:21:22,870 --> 00:21:25,240
because once you've shown the success on

415
00:21:25,240 --> 00:21:28,420
your team and how that works other

416
00:21:28,420 --> 00:21:30,430
people are going to want to be part of

417
00:21:30,430 --> 00:21:33,150
that and then you want to be able to

418
00:21:33,150 --> 00:21:36,070
mentor those other teams and to share

419
00:21:36,070 --> 00:21:37,960
the learnings with the other teams

420
00:21:37,960 --> 00:21:40,810
because for DevOps to work we've got to

421
00:21:40,810 --> 00:21:42,670
have that collaboration and that

422
00:21:42,670 --> 00:21:45,430
continuous communication because that

423
00:21:45,430 --> 00:21:47,380
all leads to our continuous improvement

424
00:21:47,380 --> 00:21:51,190
and then I just want to kind of leave

425
00:21:51,190 --> 00:21:52,870
with this which we already talked about

426
00:21:52,870 --> 00:21:55,750
but many organizations wanting to adopt

427
00:21:55,750 --> 00:21:58,360
DevOps look for a prescriptive set of

428
00:21:58,360 --> 00:22:00,820
steps or best practices to guide their

429
00:22:00,820 --> 00:22:03,340
journey but it's important to remember

430
00:22:03,340 --> 00:22:06,880
that every organization is different and

431
00:22:06,880 --> 00:22:09,220
it depends on where you are in your

432
00:22:09,220 --> 00:22:12,400
journey where you are with your tools

433
00:22:12,400 --> 00:22:15,970
your people your processes and your

434
00:22:15,970 --> 00:22:19,330
culture and with that I want to thank

435
00:22:19,330 --> 00:22:21,880
you all for taking the time to listen to

436
00:22:21,880 --> 00:22:24,910
this talk today we are still hiring at

437
00:22:24,910 --> 00:22:27,070
pager duty uh if you have any questions

438
