1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,259
ask our AJ are you great how are you I

2
00:00:04,259 --> 00:00:08,580
am doing wonderful so with that I am

3
00:00:08,580 --> 00:00:10,710
going to turn it over to you folks just

4
00:00:10,710 --> 00:00:13,110
a quick reminder before I do put your

5
00:00:13,110 --> 00:00:16,020
questions in the Q&A panel next to the

6
00:00:16,020 --> 00:00:19,080
stream and at the end of JJ's talk we'll

7
00:00:19,080 --> 00:00:21,109
get to your questions and make sure that

8
00:00:21,109 --> 00:00:24,600
you can get those answered so JJ with

9
00:00:24,600 --> 00:00:26,990
that I will turn it over to you

10
00:00:26,990 --> 00:00:30,150
sounds great thank you so much hi yes

11
00:00:30,150 --> 00:00:34,020
I'm JJ I work for IBM as you can see I'm

12
00:00:34,020 --> 00:00:35,460
wearing an IBM t-shirt that's how you

13
00:00:35,460 --> 00:00:39,239
know but I am going to today talk about

14
00:00:39,239 --> 00:00:42,180
using inspect to validate VMware

15
00:00:42,180 --> 00:00:44,520
templates if you don't know VMware

16
00:00:44,520 --> 00:00:47,010
templates are a way to create clothes

17
00:00:47,010 --> 00:00:51,480
machines to stamp out VMs basing this

18
00:00:51,480 --> 00:00:53,850
out of VMware now I was originally going

19
00:00:53,850 --> 00:00:55,559
to send some slides and all but due to

20
00:00:55,559 --> 00:00:57,750
the time restrictions I'm just going to

21
00:00:57,750 --> 00:01:00,390
jump right in and show some some code

22
00:01:00,390 --> 00:01:02,399
and hopefully that's what people want to

23
00:01:02,399 --> 00:01:04,799
see and then you can take my repo if you

24
00:01:04,799 --> 00:01:07,560
so choose and play around with it and

25
00:01:07,560 --> 00:01:09,390
then maybe even edit it to make

26
00:01:09,390 --> 00:01:11,040
yourselves a little bit easier the goal

27
00:01:11,040 --> 00:01:15,420
of this talk is just basically make sure

28
00:01:15,420 --> 00:01:16,830
that you have something to start with

29
00:01:16,830 --> 00:01:18,360
there's so many people out there who

30
00:01:18,360 --> 00:01:19,860
have no idea where to start when it

31
00:01:19,860 --> 00:01:21,420
comes to this and this is just a simple

32
00:01:21,420 --> 00:01:23,970
example to get that done so let me start

33
00:01:23,970 --> 00:01:27,119
sharing my screen and we'll share in the

34
00:01:27,119 --> 00:01:35,820
screen now let's see oops there we go so

35
00:01:35,820 --> 00:01:38,250
I would be remiss by first not

36
00:01:38,250 --> 00:01:41,430
mentioning call for code IBM gives me a

37
00:01:41,430 --> 00:01:43,439
lot of leeway to be able to speak at

38
00:01:43,439 --> 00:01:45,000
different conferences and and and

39
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:46,350
supports me and being able to tell the

40
00:01:46,350 --> 00:01:48,119
tell the story one of our big pushes

41
00:01:48,119 --> 00:01:49,439
right now is something called for code

42
00:01:49,439 --> 00:01:52,950
which allows you to help use software to

43
00:01:52,950 --> 00:01:56,880
fight including many other disasters and

44
00:01:56,880 --> 00:01:58,290
issues around the world but we are

45
00:01:58,290 --> 00:02:01,469
focusing this year on kovat 19 so just

46
00:02:01,469 --> 00:02:05,909
humor me go to call for code.org and I

47
00:02:05,909 --> 00:02:07,740
kind of just poke around that would help

48
00:02:07,740 --> 00:02:10,348
me there validate me being able to come

49
00:02:10,348 --> 00:02:12,599
and speak at things like this

50
00:02:12,599 --> 00:02:16,469
okay so now let's talk about the tools

51
00:02:16,469 --> 00:02:18,659
we're going to be using well your boss

52
00:02:18,659 --> 00:02:22,079
or your your company is decided we are

53
00:02:22,079 --> 00:02:24,900
we need to have some way to start

54
00:02:24,900 --> 00:02:26,430
validating our templates in a an

55
00:02:26,430 --> 00:02:28,230
efficient and efficient manner

56
00:02:28,230 --> 00:02:30,780
well I'm gonna put together something

57
00:02:30,780 --> 00:02:32,370
called using something called ansible

58
00:02:32,370 --> 00:02:34,109
which will do some automation for you

59
00:02:34,109 --> 00:02:36,810
something called Packer specifically

60
00:02:36,810 --> 00:02:38,700
which will actually automate and build

61
00:02:38,700 --> 00:02:40,739
the templates for us I'm going to use

62
00:02:40,739 --> 00:02:44,819
the VMware plug-in for for Packer which

63
00:02:44,819 --> 00:02:46,439
will actually build the ISO for us and

64
00:02:46,439 --> 00:02:48,389
then at the very end I'm going to use

65
00:02:48,389 --> 00:02:50,579
something called chef inspect which will

66
00:02:50,579 --> 00:02:52,079
validate the templates to make sure it's

67
00:02:52,079 --> 00:02:55,019
what I expect it to be if you've ever

68
00:02:55,019 --> 00:02:57,480
seen this is actually a VMware console

69
00:02:57,480 --> 00:02:59,669
on the IBM cloud because you can get

70
00:02:59,669 --> 00:03:02,189
VMware on IBM and we are going to play

71
00:03:02,189 --> 00:03:04,500
around in some of the templates I have

72
00:03:04,500 --> 00:03:06,599
this repo here which I can give out

73
00:03:06,599 --> 00:03:08,699
after the talk inside of slack if so if

74
00:03:08,699 --> 00:03:11,010
you so choose where it has all the code

75
00:03:11,010 --> 00:03:12,120
that we're going to be playing with and

76
00:03:12,120 --> 00:03:14,129
the beauty of this is that it really is

77
00:03:14,129 --> 00:03:17,220
just stripped down so we you see the

78
00:03:17,220 --> 00:03:19,049
there bare minimum to get the things

79
00:03:19,049 --> 00:03:22,139
done which is nice and then finally

80
00:03:22,139 --> 00:03:23,699
we're going to be using Jenkins because

81
00:03:23,699 --> 00:03:25,859
everyone uses Jenkins at some point in

82
00:03:25,859 --> 00:03:27,479
their career and it's kind of just a

83
00:03:27,479 --> 00:03:29,609
nice universal way of explaining all

84
00:03:29,609 --> 00:03:31,019
this you can either ollie different

85
00:03:31,019 --> 00:03:35,400
other CDs CI CD systems out there but

86
00:03:35,400 --> 00:03:37,019
specifically I'm going to be using

87
00:03:37,019 --> 00:03:38,400
Jenkins because I thought was more

88
00:03:38,400 --> 00:03:43,049
Universal okay so I am going to minimize

89
00:03:43,049 --> 00:03:46,229
that to make sure I have my notes so the

90
00:03:46,229 --> 00:03:49,799
first thing first I truly believe that

91
00:03:49,799 --> 00:03:53,250
the templates you should have and use

92
00:03:53,250 --> 00:03:54,959
configuration management to build up

93
00:03:54,959 --> 00:03:57,959
from the ground up is so we're going to

94
00:03:57,959 --> 00:03:59,819
take this golden image which is just a

95
00:03:59,819 --> 00:04:02,040
base install of Debian I'm going to

96
00:04:02,040 --> 00:04:03,569
create a new template for it and I'll

97
00:04:03,569 --> 00:04:05,340
just in called AoE you because I'm a

98
00:04:05,340 --> 00:04:08,370
nerd and type in Dvorak and I'm going to

99
00:04:08,370 --> 00:04:10,859
build this this template very simply and

100
00:04:10,859 --> 00:04:13,109
power it on it'll take a second to do

101
00:04:13,109 --> 00:04:15,780
because you know computers but as this

102
00:04:15,780 --> 00:04:17,430
comes up I want to prove to you that it

103
00:04:17,430 --> 00:04:19,680
is a blank template with nothing on it

104
00:04:19,680 --> 00:04:22,529
and what we're going to do is I am going

105
00:04:22,529 --> 00:04:26,330
to first install

106
00:04:26,520 --> 00:04:29,979
using this playbook right here I'm going

107
00:04:29,979 --> 00:04:33,009
to install nginx so we're just going to

108
00:04:33,009 --> 00:04:35,289
run the run the the pipeline to make

109
00:04:35,289 --> 00:04:37,509
sure it all works and get nginx on that

110
00:04:37,509 --> 00:04:38,680
but first I'm gonna prove to you that

111
00:04:38,680 --> 00:04:43,060
there is nothing there so bring this up

112
00:04:43,060 --> 00:04:48,190
and then is this up and running are you

113
00:04:48,190 --> 00:04:49,440
there

114
00:04:49,440 --> 00:04:57,460
refresh tu-tu-tu-tu-tu-tu waiting for

115
00:04:57,460 --> 00:05:00,509
VMware tools like you always do

116
00:05:00,509 --> 00:05:04,449
come on VMware tools or open-vm-tools I

117
00:05:04,449 --> 00:05:09,240
think it is now because open-source

118
00:05:09,240 --> 00:05:15,479
singing a long wait another thing -

119
00:05:16,169 --> 00:05:20,800
there we go so it's a 225 alright so I'm

120
00:05:20,800 --> 00:05:26,409
going to do SSH admin E or Metheny it's

121
00:05:26,409 --> 00:05:39,639
a 216 and 225 here we go so if you don't

122
00:05:39,639 --> 00:05:42,159
know the first thing that nginx does is

123
00:05:42,159 --> 00:05:44,229
creates an engine X directory and as you

124
00:05:44,229 --> 00:05:48,729
can see here Oh sh oh and Gen X it is

125
00:05:48,729 --> 00:05:51,370
not that cool cool we all agree that

126
00:05:51,370 --> 00:05:53,560
this is a blank blank type like very

127
00:05:53,560 --> 00:05:56,440
very basic debian 10 and it's all it's

128
00:05:56,440 --> 00:05:57,849
going to show there but now what I'm

129
00:05:57,849 --> 00:06:00,550
going to do is this is going I am going

130
00:06:00,550 --> 00:06:03,969
to kick off this build and I'm going to

131
00:06:03,969 --> 00:06:07,409
build master because that is what I want

132
00:06:07,409 --> 00:06:10,449
master so I'm gonna build him after here

133
00:06:10,449 --> 00:06:12,879
and with that run well that's running

134
00:06:12,879 --> 00:06:13,949
I'm going to talk a little bit about

135
00:06:13,949 --> 00:06:18,190
inspire ansible if you don't know as you

136
00:06:18,190 --> 00:06:21,669
can see it's written in yellow you'll be

137
00:06:21,669 --> 00:06:24,099
able to make sure that using the after

138
00:06:24,099 --> 00:06:27,009
resource that it'll pull in and jex and

139
00:06:27,009 --> 00:06:29,919
make sure it's the latest version and it

140
00:06:29,919 --> 00:06:31,240
updates the cache to make sure that we

141
00:06:31,240 --> 00:06:34,240
have yep get repo there also as you

142
00:06:34,240 --> 00:06:36,460
notice very importantly it starts engine

143
00:06:36,460 --> 00:06:39,889
X on there this is very vital for later

144
00:06:39,889 --> 00:06:42,259
the this narrative where what I'll end

145
00:06:42,259 --> 00:06:44,229
up doing is island of creating a PR

146
00:06:44,229 --> 00:06:46,370
where I'll actually end up adding a user

147
00:06:46,370 --> 00:06:49,490
and then I'm going to show the actual

148
00:06:49,490 --> 00:06:51,560
security portion of it which is the

149
00:06:51,560 --> 00:06:53,389
inspect making sure is how it expected

150
00:06:53,389 --> 00:06:55,969
to be so as you can see here we are

151
00:06:55,969 --> 00:06:59,150
actually building the main Packer image

152
00:06:59,150 --> 00:07:02,659
now and there we go it's calling the VM

153
00:07:02,659 --> 00:07:08,080
again waiting for VM tools to come up as

154
00:07:08,080 --> 00:07:12,590
this goes in spec is basically a

155
00:07:12,590 --> 00:07:14,750
compliance language where you can write

156
00:07:14,750 --> 00:07:16,849
in very simple English like language to

157
00:07:16,849 --> 00:07:18,710
make sure that things are the state this

158
00:07:18,710 --> 00:07:20,289
states you expect it to be in

159
00:07:20,289 --> 00:07:22,039
specifically what we're going to be

160
00:07:22,039 --> 00:07:24,860
doing is very validating very simple

161
00:07:24,860 --> 00:07:29,779
profile which is making sure in nginx is

162
00:07:29,779 --> 00:07:31,819
the state we expect it to be in which I

163
00:07:31,819 --> 00:07:32,960
will show you here in a moment

164
00:07:32,960 --> 00:07:35,229
and then also you can pull in other

165
00:07:35,229 --> 00:07:37,759
profiles from other other people or

166
00:07:37,759 --> 00:07:39,589
other companies or good straight

167
00:07:39,589 --> 00:07:41,539
defaults which we'll do here in just a

168
00:07:41,539 --> 00:07:44,229
second to make sure that for instance

169
00:07:44,229 --> 00:07:46,789
Etsy host isn't set to seven seven seven

170
00:07:46,789 --> 00:07:48,710
for instance that's usually a bad thing

171
00:07:48,710 --> 00:07:50,779
as you can see some sanity checks there

172
00:07:50,779 --> 00:07:53,509
is a Linux baseline right here to make

173
00:07:53,509 --> 00:07:56,389
sure that Etsy shadow exists and the

174
00:07:56,389 --> 00:07:58,490
states we expect if you look here

175
00:07:58,490 --> 00:08:02,300
there's a bunch of good open-source dev

176
00:08:02,300 --> 00:08:04,580
SEC Linux baselines so you can just

177
00:08:04,580 --> 00:08:08,360
swoop in to make sure that your your

178
00:08:08,360 --> 00:08:11,750
profile is that pause to saying defaults

179
00:08:11,750 --> 00:08:13,789
again this is one of those things that

180
00:08:13,789 --> 00:08:15,439
if you just put it inside if your

181
00:08:15,439 --> 00:08:17,930
pipeline instance in this case my Jacobs

182
00:08:17,930 --> 00:08:20,210
pipeline this will always run this will

183
00:08:20,210 --> 00:08:24,620
always make sure that my my repo or my

184
00:08:24,620 --> 00:08:27,560
template is exactly as secure as it can

185
00:08:27,560 --> 00:08:30,560
be by these open source standards and it

186
00:08:30,560 --> 00:08:33,019
as you can see it took no time at all

187
00:08:33,019 --> 00:08:36,078
which in turn allows for you know one

188
00:08:36,078 --> 00:08:38,679
less thing to worry about

189
00:08:40,889 --> 00:08:42,389
and then as you can see it's pulled in

190
00:08:42,389 --> 00:08:44,009
the nginx profile here and I'll bring up

191
00:08:44,009 --> 00:08:46,790
nginx well as going just one last time

192
00:08:46,790 --> 00:08:49,049
we are going to validate that every

193
00:08:49,049 --> 00:08:51,209
single time that this directory should

194
00:08:51,209 --> 00:08:55,819
exist here this the actual nginx

195
00:08:55,819 --> 00:08:57,959
application is up and running and has

196
00:08:57,959 --> 00:08:59,999
various permissions and most importantly

197
00:08:59,999 --> 00:09:02,429
that nginx should be actually running

198
00:09:02,429 --> 00:09:06,569
this is due to later on the narrative

199
00:09:06,569 --> 00:09:09,149
here and as you can see we do some

200
00:09:09,149 --> 00:09:11,309
PowerShell and make sure everything's

201
00:09:11,309 --> 00:09:14,309
built and we see that we have a green

202
00:09:14,309 --> 00:09:19,559
pipeline yay all good ok cool so what

203
00:09:19,559 --> 00:09:22,350
we're going to do now is I'm going to go

204
00:09:22,350 --> 00:09:25,139
back to that exact same file here and

205
00:09:25,139 --> 00:09:30,600
I'm going to put in a PR here where we

206
00:09:30,600 --> 00:09:34,679
are going to it's going to add an ops

207
00:09:34,679 --> 00:09:36,629
user so as you can see it's the exact

208
00:09:36,629 --> 00:09:39,149
same code nginx and now we're on top of

209
00:09:39,149 --> 00:09:40,709
the same code we're going to put inside

210
00:09:40,709 --> 00:09:43,079
of this PR user so I'm going to come

211
00:09:43,079 --> 00:09:46,019
over here and go back here get checked

212
00:09:46,019 --> 00:09:51,779
out that's pjj a good PR ok oops

213
00:09:51,779 --> 00:09:56,629
PR too because I'm lazy ok git status

214
00:09:56,629 --> 00:10:06,709
get good comments I'm a good a good PR

215
00:10:06,709 --> 00:10:15,989
push origin PR q ok because I have

216
00:10:15,989 --> 00:10:19,319
ancient or my Jenkins instance tied up

217
00:10:19,319 --> 00:10:21,929
against the repo no we will take it but

218
00:10:21,929 --> 00:10:23,939
took about a minute or so for the actual

219
00:10:23,939 --> 00:10:25,980
kickoff to happen but again this is just

220
00:10:25,980 --> 00:10:29,009
making sure the pipeline is doing what I

221
00:10:29,009 --> 00:10:32,009
expect it to do which is you know at

222
00:10:32,009 --> 00:10:35,220
this new user the beauty of it is as

223
00:10:35,220 --> 00:10:37,350
you'll see here in a moment when this

224
00:10:37,350 --> 00:10:39,049
kicks off I actually have two different

225
00:10:39,049 --> 00:10:42,899
JSON files to tell the and to sell

226
00:10:42,899 --> 00:10:46,470
specifically Jenkins what to do what

227
00:10:46,470 --> 00:10:47,970
we're going to create is actually

228
00:10:47,970 --> 00:10:51,360
another template with the name of the

229
00:10:51,360 --> 00:10:53,579
machine Debian - PR which you'll see

230
00:10:53,579 --> 00:10:54,480
here in a moment

231
00:10:54,480 --> 00:10:56,490
so I can actually go validate it myself

232
00:10:56,490 --> 00:10:58,170
even though I have all the automate

233
00:10:58,170 --> 00:11:00,600
automate occation but if the PR breaks

234
00:11:00,600 --> 00:11:02,699
for instance it'll put it into a state

235
00:11:02,699 --> 00:11:06,000
where it'll be broken but I can only see

236
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:08,010
why it broke so instead of blowing away

237
00:11:08,010 --> 00:11:10,260
the template after the fact I can

238
00:11:10,260 --> 00:11:12,990
actually go do the investigation on the

239
00:11:12,990 --> 00:11:14,310
machine to make sure it's what I expect

240
00:11:14,310 --> 00:11:18,149
it to be which is wonderful okay it

241
00:11:18,149 --> 00:11:19,680
should be happening any minute and of

242
00:11:19,680 --> 00:11:22,680
course there we go as you see it's

243
00:11:22,680 --> 00:11:24,120
pending and it's going to pull this in

244
00:11:24,120 --> 00:11:27,449
just a moment we will see here it takes

245
00:11:27,449 --> 00:11:28,800
about two minutes as you can see which

246
00:11:28,800 --> 00:11:33,260
isn't too bad again this is just a demo

247
00:11:33,260 --> 00:11:37,829
so as we'll go and we're installing no

248
00:11:37,829 --> 00:11:39,060
you don't actually to install a lot of

249
00:11:39,060 --> 00:11:40,649
this stuff every single time if you

250
00:11:40,649 --> 00:11:44,940
don't want you can I make this quicker

251
00:11:44,940 --> 00:11:49,190
um oh no what happened here

252
00:11:49,850 --> 00:11:52,940
Debian gold not found that's not good oh

253
00:11:52,940 --> 00:11:56,329
it's because I didn't actually create it

254
00:11:56,329 --> 00:11:59,670
okay I need to change the name one of

255
00:11:59,670 --> 00:12:01,769
the beauties of the the thing I do is I

256
00:12:01,769 --> 00:12:03,899
actually you notice I take a steam stamp

257
00:12:03,899 --> 00:12:06,240
and create the gold image so I can

258
00:12:06,240 --> 00:12:08,670
always roll it back every time I push

259
00:12:08,670 --> 00:12:11,339
out master I create a new stamp of the

260
00:12:11,339 --> 00:12:13,440
original gold image so if something goes

261
00:12:13,440 --> 00:12:15,630
horribly horribly wrong I have that

262
00:12:15,630 --> 00:12:17,040
actual template there to run run

263
00:12:17,040 --> 00:12:18,899
backwards so what I'll do is I will

264
00:12:18,899 --> 00:12:22,380
delete this first and I was actually in

265
00:12:22,380 --> 00:12:25,170
my notes - story of hope I've demos I

266
00:12:25,170 --> 00:12:28,440
guess and then I will take this delete

267
00:12:28,440 --> 00:12:34,079
that okay okay if you haven't noticed if

268
00:12:34,079 --> 00:12:35,519
you are VMware user you're probably

269
00:12:35,519 --> 00:12:37,199
wondering JJ that should all happen like

270
00:12:37,199 --> 00:12:38,819
automatically why you keep refreshing it

271
00:12:38,819 --> 00:12:40,380
turns I have to go through a proxy but

272
00:12:40,380 --> 00:12:41,850
that's a different conversation for

273
00:12:41,850 --> 00:12:45,750
another day okay let's try that again so

274
00:12:45,750 --> 00:12:49,709
I will go ahead and come over here and I

275
00:12:49,709 --> 00:12:53,459
will because I am paranoid I am going to

276
00:12:53,459 --> 00:12:57,720
do this because I have actually seen

277
00:12:57,720 --> 00:13:04,730
that go awry before stage commits oh man

278
00:13:04,730 --> 00:13:06,769
because like all good hops guys deep

279
00:13:06,769 --> 00:13:11,930
down inside I write the best the best

280
00:13:11,930 --> 00:13:14,480
comments I'll try to make a joke I'm

281
00:13:14,480 --> 00:13:16,690
thinking now yeah

282
00:13:16,690 --> 00:13:25,399
urging PRQ now i'm kagaz of the time i'm

283
00:13:25,399 --> 00:13:26,990
trying to shoot past this stuff as

284
00:13:26,990 --> 00:13:28,490
quickly as i can to make sure that we

285
00:13:28,490 --> 00:13:30,290
have some time for questions of if so we

286
00:13:30,290 --> 00:13:39,199
so desire come back over here show me

287
00:13:39,199 --> 00:13:43,160
some come on come on so let me go ahead

288
00:13:43,160 --> 00:13:45,350
and while this is running I will show

289
00:13:45,350 --> 00:13:47,360
the actual Jenkins file that I have is

290
00:13:47,360 --> 00:13:49,750
an example here

291
00:13:49,750 --> 00:13:52,370
Jenkins files are running in groovy if

292
00:13:52,370 --> 00:13:55,250
you didn't know as you can see I this is

293
00:13:55,250 --> 00:13:58,250
very honestly kind of hacky but it does

294
00:13:58,250 --> 00:14:00,079
it does what we're expecting you to do

295
00:14:00,079 --> 00:14:03,290
which as we saw in installs Packer it

296
00:14:03,290 --> 00:14:05,959
makes sure and sees what branch it's on

297
00:14:05,959 --> 00:14:08,060
if it's anything other than master it

298
00:14:08,060 --> 00:14:12,410
grabs in a variables file and then sorry

299
00:14:12,410 --> 00:14:15,199
if it is if it is master it grabs in my

300
00:14:15,199 --> 00:14:17,420
default variables file which has the

301
00:14:17,420 --> 00:14:19,399
names that I'm expected to be and then

302
00:14:19,399 --> 00:14:22,459
the PRS and then if it is anything other

303
00:14:22,459 --> 00:14:24,620
than master it pulls in the not master

304
00:14:24,620 --> 00:14:27,069
one which I'm again naming his heart

305
00:14:27,069 --> 00:14:31,100
then it runs Packer as we've seen and

306
00:14:31,100 --> 00:14:33,980
then it goes ahead and builds the other

307
00:14:33,980 --> 00:14:36,250
version and then it runs a very simple

308
00:14:36,250 --> 00:14:40,040
power power COI script to make sure it

309
00:14:40,040 --> 00:14:42,110
changes the names force which as this is

310
00:14:42,110 --> 00:14:44,810
going as we can see as we see we're pet

311
00:14:44,810 --> 00:14:45,980
building the Packer image right now

312
00:14:45,980 --> 00:14:48,949
because it's starting to be nice to me

313
00:14:48,949 --> 00:14:52,389
oops starting to be nice to me while

314
00:14:52,389 --> 00:14:54,709
that is running I will show you the

315
00:14:54,709 --> 00:14:57,260
convert to cold machine police don't pay

316
00:14:57,260 --> 00:14:59,990
attention to that password as you can

317
00:14:59,990 --> 00:15:01,940
see it does just some very basic power

318
00:15:01,940 --> 00:15:03,920
COI things again you can't actually get

319
00:15:03,920 --> 00:15:06,980
to this V V center so you know I'm okay

320
00:15:06,980 --> 00:15:09,170
we're showing that please don't steal

321
00:15:09,170 --> 00:15:11,320
that password

322
00:15:11,320 --> 00:15:17,630
let's see here and the next goal which

323
00:15:17,630 --> 00:15:21,020
if I have my timing down properly we

324
00:15:21,020 --> 00:15:25,220
will be going ahead and you know what I

325
00:15:25,220 --> 00:15:28,010
will just go ahead and prep that now um

326
00:15:28,010 --> 00:15:29,360
we're going to go ahead and say that

327
00:15:29,360 --> 00:15:31,760
that was successful but it turns out

328
00:15:31,760 --> 00:15:33,800
because the world is an evil place

329
00:15:33,800 --> 00:15:37,610
sometimes we've had someone decided

330
00:15:37,610 --> 00:15:41,450
oops beep decide someone has decided to

331
00:15:41,450 --> 00:15:46,430
move from nginx to Apache and they went

332
00:15:46,430 --> 00:15:51,140
ahead and changed the the playbook here

333
00:15:51,140 --> 00:15:55,760
to stop nginx of remove nginx and then

334
00:15:55,760 --> 00:15:59,060
ensure that Apache 2 was installed and

335
00:15:59,060 --> 00:16:02,390
then make sure we start apache 2 now if

336
00:16:02,390 --> 00:16:04,970
you notice this system just changing the

337
00:16:04,970 --> 00:16:07,250
playbook so they went along and push

338
00:16:07,250 --> 00:16:09,860
this in and we're like hey wait a second

339
00:16:09,860 --> 00:16:12,140
that's enough that's not great but okay

340
00:16:12,140 --> 00:16:14,779
go ahead and do that cook and as you can

341
00:16:14,779 --> 00:16:17,150
see we've had our inspect we've

342
00:16:17,150 --> 00:16:18,529
everything everything he's built up how

343
00:16:18,529 --> 00:16:22,480
we expect it to be and then gift master

344
00:16:22,480 --> 00:16:33,080
hip check out let's be bad dr2 so come

345
00:16:33,080 --> 00:16:38,990
back over here they come along and

346
00:16:38,990 --> 00:16:53,830
decided to push this in yes yes I'm a

347
00:16:53,830 --> 00:16:57,670
bad actor

348
00:16:57,670 --> 00:17:04,730
it's Bush organ your to somebody's come

349
00:17:04,730 --> 00:17:06,500
along and decided that they really

350
00:17:06,500 --> 00:17:09,130
really wanted Apache instead of nginx

351
00:17:09,130 --> 00:17:13,329
but as you'll notice here in a moment

352
00:17:13,329 --> 00:17:15,740
it'll actually push everything out build

353
00:17:15,740 --> 00:17:17,150
it exactly how we expect it to

354
00:17:17,150 --> 00:17:19,730
and double check that we still have that

355
00:17:19,730 --> 00:17:23,880
debian gold here we go good

356
00:17:23,880 --> 00:17:38,630
I just lost the repo copy-paste and go

357
00:17:38,630 --> 00:17:42,360
so we'll create this repo again I'm a

358
00:17:42,360 --> 00:17:47,340
bad actor and I again I apologize for

359
00:17:47,340 --> 00:17:48,750
shooting past shooting through this so

360
00:17:48,750 --> 00:17:50,970
quickly but hopefully your signs see how

361
00:17:50,970 --> 00:17:51,870
all the different pieces to come

362
00:17:51,870 --> 00:17:53,760
together where we'll have the actual

363
00:17:53,760 --> 00:17:56,490
good good process with the inspect

364
00:17:56,490 --> 00:17:58,140
checking to make sure that it does what

365
00:17:58,140 --> 00:18:00,690
we expect but now when we have someone

366
00:18:00,690 --> 00:18:04,200
who has not updated the inspect profile

367
00:18:04,200 --> 00:18:06,750
because we're already just running it we

368
00:18:06,750 --> 00:18:08,370
make sure that the status is there and

369
00:18:08,370 --> 00:18:12,510
everything will happen we should keyword

370
00:18:12,510 --> 00:18:17,130
should good PR as you saw it was

371
00:18:17,130 --> 00:18:21,060
successful which is what we wanted we're

372
00:18:21,060 --> 00:18:26,730
finishing and come on so we're gonna go

373
00:18:26,730 --> 00:18:28,380
ahead and just pulling off that same

374
00:18:28,380 --> 00:18:30,600
golden image where you're going to make

375
00:18:30,600 --> 00:18:31,890
the changes to attempt to make the

376
00:18:31,890 --> 00:18:35,550
changes we're going I see this run and

377
00:18:35,550 --> 00:18:38,370
it's gonna fail not that I'm spoiling

378
00:18:38,370 --> 00:18:41,190
this or anything but you know gotta

379
00:18:41,190 --> 00:18:48,810
gotta tell that story to do oh no what

380
00:18:48,810 --> 00:18:49,500
happened there

381
00:18:49,500 --> 00:18:56,640
oh come on come on JJ the template one

382
00:18:56,640 --> 00:18:59,700
already existed so obviously you need to

383
00:18:59,700 --> 00:19:01,320
write some better clean up around this I

384
00:19:01,320 --> 00:19:03,680
had better clean up I will admit but

385
00:19:03,680 --> 00:19:05,790
computers they're not always the nicest

386
00:19:05,790 --> 00:19:08,520
things in the world but with a little

387
00:19:08,520 --> 00:19:09,390
bit of work and a little bit of

388
00:19:09,390 --> 00:19:11,010
robustness everything kind of works a

389
00:19:11,010 --> 00:19:18,440
little bit better and make this modified

390
00:19:20,179 --> 00:19:28,090
you do push origin let's try that again

391
00:19:28,210 --> 00:19:33,919
go back over here we should see 44 going

392
00:19:33,919 --> 00:19:43,460
come on 44 44 I got 42 it's been 19

393
00:19:43,460 --> 00:19:46,820
minutes and 45 seconds so I want to want

394
00:19:46,820 --> 00:19:47,960
to make sure people have time to ask

395
00:19:47,960 --> 00:19:49,789
questions we'll say so choose but I want

396
00:19:49,789 --> 00:19:51,499
to show them it actually does what I say

397
00:19:51,499 --> 00:19:53,799
it does come on

398
00:19:53,799 --> 00:19:57,289
maybe me me

399
00:19:57,289 --> 00:20:08,360
maybe computers do your work maybe we've

400
00:20:08,360 --> 00:20:13,100
seen it kick off a couple times now I'm

401
00:20:13,100 --> 00:20:16,730
a bad actor there we go pretty good

402
00:20:16,730 --> 00:20:18,710
triggered triggered there we go

403
00:20:18,710 --> 00:20:22,220
I call him Kiko by the way if you didn't

404
00:20:22,220 --> 00:20:26,990
notice Piko Piko but but you know i have

405
00:20:26,990 --> 00:20:29,259
kids

406
00:20:29,470 --> 00:20:32,269
he goes very helpful if you ever seen

407
00:20:32,269 --> 00:20:34,129
Dora the Explorer here we go

408
00:20:34,129 --> 00:20:42,769
bad actor we're quoting the VM and we're

409
00:20:42,769 --> 00:20:49,690
powering on the VM oops

410
00:20:49,749 --> 00:20:51,909
we're waiting for that IP because

411
00:20:51,909 --> 00:20:55,519
open-vm-tools is fast um well this is

412
00:20:55,519 --> 00:20:57,470
going I strongly suggest taking a look

413
00:20:57,470 --> 00:20:59,929
at the tutorials for a chef in spec it

414
00:20:59,929 --> 00:21:02,960
is unbelievably powerful and because of

415
00:21:02,960 --> 00:21:05,960
the there's many many plugins to run

416
00:21:05,960 --> 00:21:08,990
inspect with other things it will make

417
00:21:08,990 --> 00:21:10,639
your life significantly easier

418
00:21:10,639 --> 00:21:13,460
especially for security and validating

419
00:21:13,460 --> 00:21:15,740
things that you need to you write it

420
00:21:15,740 --> 00:21:18,409
once and it we can just run and you

421
00:21:18,409 --> 00:21:21,080
never have to worry about the checks

422
00:21:21,080 --> 00:21:23,539
again as long as you put it inside of

423
00:21:23,539 --> 00:21:26,509
some type of pipeline to validate things

424
00:21:26,509 --> 00:21:30,109
and I will show here because we have

425
00:21:30,109 --> 00:21:33,939
decided to install

426
00:21:36,230 --> 00:21:39,740
playbook come on - Nikolai our enemy

427
00:21:39,740 --> 00:21:41,160
here we go

428
00:21:41,160 --> 00:21:43,170
ensure nginx so it's installing because

429
00:21:43,170 --> 00:21:44,360
it's inside impotant

430
00:21:44,360 --> 00:21:47,420
it's installing it's making sure I'd

431
00:21:47,420 --> 00:21:51,630
nginx is that and then we install our

432
00:21:51,630 --> 00:21:54,870
ops user which I never actually showed I

433
00:21:54,870 --> 00:21:57,630
mean I guess I could now but that ops

434
00:21:57,630 --> 00:22:00,390
user is there so I could actually SSH in

435
00:22:00,390 --> 00:22:04,440
as it that's my public key now it's

436
00:22:04,440 --> 00:22:07,980
installing Apache - and then it's going

437
00:22:07,980 --> 00:22:13,530
to run our sanity checks because sanity

438
00:22:13,530 --> 00:22:16,020
checks because we have policies there we

439
00:22:16,020 --> 00:22:20,730
go now running in spec and then ah wait

440
00:22:20,730 --> 00:22:23,750
a second did you see this ha ha ha

441
00:22:23,750 --> 00:22:27,720
because we did not change our our

442
00:22:27,720 --> 00:22:30,600
profile at the same time and because we

443
00:22:30,600 --> 00:22:32,070
had stopped engine X and due to that

444
00:22:32,070 --> 00:22:34,560
they pipeline stops and then blows

445
00:22:34,560 --> 00:22:36,120
everything up which is exactly what

446
00:22:36,120 --> 00:22:38,880
we're hoping to see right it gives us

447
00:22:38,880 --> 00:22:41,910
that opportunity I guess I missed a flag

448
00:22:41,910 --> 00:22:43,950
that's not supposed to destroy the VM

449
00:22:43,950 --> 00:22:47,580
but I guess it did this time again this

450
00:22:47,580 --> 00:22:49,020
is exactly what we're hoping for so you

451
00:22:49,020 --> 00:22:51,380
don't sneak in things you don't expect

452
00:22:51,380 --> 00:22:53,730
inspectors your validator and make sure

453
00:22:53,730 --> 00:22:55,640
that things are what you hope they are

454
00:22:55,640 --> 00:22:58,580
so hopefully hopefully that was

455
00:22:58,580 --> 00:23:02,040
educational and maybe as you saw it was

456
00:23:02,040 --> 00:23:03,420
just a bunch of code flying back and

457
00:23:03,420 --> 00:23:06,720
forth but my Reis what my access our

458
00:23:06,720 --> 00:23:08,340
police never hesitate to reach out to me

459
00:23:08,340 --> 00:23:12,510
I literally do have the email address of

460
00:23:12,510 --> 00:23:16,500
Awesome at IBM calm and I just lost the

461
00:23:16,500 --> 00:23:22,200
screen uh where did it go when I stole

462
00:23:22,200 --> 00:23:26,400
here hello nope you're still here but

463
00:23:26,400 --> 00:23:28,620
yeah we looks like you stopped sharing

464
00:23:28,620 --> 00:23:31,020
your screen yes that's what I meant um

465
00:23:31,020 --> 00:23:33,840
so I'm one to be cognizant people to see

466
00:23:33,840 --> 00:23:34,800
if they have any questions or thoughts

467
00:23:34,800 --> 00:23:37,590
um we have eight minutes left is that

468
00:23:37,590 --> 00:23:39,900
right yeah a little less cos we'll

469
00:23:39,900 --> 00:23:41,400
switch over to the next speaker but

470
00:23:41,400 --> 00:23:42,870
before we do yeah if you've got

471
00:23:42,870 --> 00:23:45,630
questions folks again Q&A tab to the

472
00:23:45,630 --> 00:23:46,650
rates

473
00:23:46,650 --> 00:23:48,790
and I know I just pointed the wrong

474
00:23:48,790 --> 00:23:51,610
direction cuz everything's backwards to

475
00:23:51,610 --> 00:23:55,059
the right side of the the stream go

476
00:23:55,059 --> 00:23:57,400
ahead ask your questions or are you

477
00:23:57,400 --> 00:23:58,840
gonna be JJ are you gonna be around in

478
00:23:58,840 --> 00:24:00,309
slack for a little bit too that people

479
00:24:00,309 --> 00:24:02,530
can connect with you absolutely

480
00:24:02,530 --> 00:24:05,740
III again said I'm sorry that it was so

481
00:24:05,740 --> 00:24:07,630
quick and there was a lot of information

482
00:24:07,630 --> 00:24:09,669
there but hopefully it got the point

483
00:24:09,669 --> 00:24:12,309
across of using inspect to validate your

484
00:24:12,309 --> 00:24:14,890
templates which is if you in the VMware

485
00:24:14,890 --> 00:24:16,570
world normally configuration management

486
00:24:16,570 --> 00:24:18,429
the building up these templates aren't

487
00:24:18,429 --> 00:24:20,350
something you do you don't write the

488
00:24:20,350 --> 00:24:22,809
code to get the template to be done well

489
00:24:22,809 --> 00:24:24,820
people are starting to do that but

490
00:24:24,820 --> 00:24:26,080
they're not doing the second side of the

491
00:24:26,080 --> 00:24:28,419
coin which is validating they are just

492
00:24:28,419 --> 00:24:29,980
writing the code and saying yeah it's

493
00:24:29,980 --> 00:24:33,280
done I'm cool it's all good yeah but no

494
00:24:33,280 --> 00:24:35,710
no you need to have some validation you

495
00:24:35,710 --> 00:24:37,510
need to make sure because in six months

496
00:24:37,510 --> 00:24:39,790
time that person's going to change nginx

497
00:24:39,790 --> 00:24:41,650
to Apache and then when you get that

498
00:24:41,650 --> 00:24:43,090
template out to production because you

499
00:24:43,090 --> 00:24:44,799
just cloned it out because honestly

500
00:24:44,799 --> 00:24:47,830
that's what you're gonna do you're gonna

501
00:24:47,830 --> 00:24:49,540
be like you're gonna have a production

502
00:24:49,540 --> 00:24:51,250
outage and that's usually not a good

503
00:24:51,250 --> 00:24:54,720
thing for your boss to find out about

504
00:24:55,470 --> 00:24:58,210
all right well I don't have any

505
00:24:58,210 --> 00:25:00,130
questions for you showing up in either

506
00:25:00,130 --> 00:25:02,890
the chats but we will let people connect

507
00:25:02,890 --> 00:25:04,390

508
00:25:04,390 --> 00:25:05,470
