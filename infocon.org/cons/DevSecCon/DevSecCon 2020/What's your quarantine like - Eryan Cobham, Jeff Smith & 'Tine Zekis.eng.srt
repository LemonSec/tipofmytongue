1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,560
with covet 19 sort of changing this the

2
00:00:02,560 --> 00:00:03,679
very fact that we're having this

3
00:00:03,679 --> 00:00:04,319
virtually

4
00:00:04,319 --> 00:00:07,359
as a result of covet 19. um and i

5
00:00:07,359 --> 00:00:08,800
thought it would be good for us to sort

6
00:00:08,800 --> 00:00:09,679
of just like

7
00:00:09,679 --> 00:00:11,360
you know pull away the curtain and stop

8
00:00:11,360 --> 00:00:13,519
pretending like everything is normal

9
00:00:13,519 --> 00:00:15,280
because everything is not normal uh

10
00:00:15,280 --> 00:00:16,800
things are radically different

11
00:00:16,800 --> 00:00:18,400
and people are coping with it

12
00:00:18,400 --> 00:00:20,000
differently people are dealing with it

13
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:20,800
differently so

14
00:00:20,800 --> 00:00:21,840
i thought it would be fun to have a

15
00:00:21,840 --> 00:00:24,160
little segment on here about how we're

16
00:00:24,160 --> 00:00:25,760
sort of handling quarantine

17
00:00:25,760 --> 00:00:29,119
so i'd love to see uh questions comments

18
00:00:29,119 --> 00:00:31,519
feedbacks both in the slack and in the

19
00:00:31,519 --> 00:00:33,760
slido session but uh before we get

20
00:00:33,760 --> 00:00:35,120
started i'm going to go ahead and bring

21
00:00:35,120 --> 00:00:36,239
on my guests

22
00:00:36,239 --> 00:00:38,640
uh i'll allow team and aryan to

23
00:00:38,640 --> 00:00:40,000
introduce themselves

24
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:44,320
uh team welcome to the program hello

25
00:00:44,320 --> 00:00:47,600
um so yeah i'm teen zikas teen is short

26
00:00:47,600 --> 00:00:49,280
for christine i think that usually

27
00:00:49,280 --> 00:00:52,480
helps people um in my

28
00:00:52,480 --> 00:00:54,399
former life i was a high school math

29
00:00:54,399 --> 00:00:55,760
teacher

30
00:00:55,760 --> 00:00:59,199
and uh a while back i was subbing for um

31
00:00:59,199 --> 00:01:01,520
a teacher who was also teaching ap

32
00:01:01,520 --> 00:01:02,800
computer science

33
00:01:02,800 --> 00:01:04,879
and it was basically like a java one

34
00:01:04,879 --> 00:01:06,720
class and i realized i really liked

35
00:01:06,720 --> 00:01:07,360
coding

36
00:01:07,360 --> 00:01:10,400
um and i didn't like forcing a bunch of

37
00:01:10,400 --> 00:01:12,000
high schoolers to

38
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:13,840
be in a room listening to me talk about

39
00:01:13,840 --> 00:01:15,040
math so

40
00:01:15,040 --> 00:01:18,159
um about five years ago i i did a boot

41
00:01:18,159 --> 00:01:18,960
camp

42
00:01:18,960 --> 00:01:22,159
i was in dev boot camp and been

43
00:01:22,159 --> 00:01:24,400
a software engineer ever since now i'm a

44
00:01:24,400 --> 00:01:26,159
software engineer working at

45
00:01:26,159 --> 00:01:29,280

an educational uh software application

55
00:01:52,479 --> 00:01:54,960
um that uh so as you can imagine we're

56
00:01:54,960 --> 00:01:56,320
kind of busy right now

57
00:01:56,320 --> 00:01:59,200
um like team i'm actually a career

58
00:01:59,200 --> 00:02:00,479
switcher also

59
00:02:00,479 --> 00:02:04,000
um about 10 years ago um

60
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:07,040
i was practicing law uh here in chicago

61
00:02:07,040 --> 00:02:08,878
um i was miserable

62
00:02:08,878 --> 00:02:11,440
and i had already done some computer

63
00:02:11,440 --> 00:02:12,560
programming

64
00:02:12,560 --> 00:02:14,239
taking some computer science classes and

65
00:02:14,239 --> 00:02:16,720
stuff like that in undergrad and so

66
00:02:16,720 --> 00:02:19,520
i decided to mix make the switch started

67
00:02:19,520 --> 00:02:21,520
doing some

68
00:02:21,520 --> 00:02:23,200
started doing some consulting some

69
00:02:23,200 --> 00:02:24,720
freelance work and

70
00:02:24,720 --> 00:02:26,640
that was enough to kind of get me in the

71
00:02:26,640 --> 00:02:27,760
door uh

72
00:02:27,760 --> 00:02:29,200
started at sears worked there for a

73
00:02:29,200 --> 00:02:31,760
couple years uh worked for the 2012

74
00:02:31,760 --> 00:02:33,920
obama campaign here in chicago

75
00:02:33,920 --> 00:02:36,000
and after that i was at a consulting

76
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:37,280
company also here

77
00:02:37,280 --> 00:02:40,160
um for about six years uh and then i

78
00:02:40,160 --> 00:02:41,840
started last year as the director of

79
00:02:41,840 --> 00:02:43,920
engineering at think circa

80
00:02:43,920 --> 00:02:46,400
all right so i you know we'll start with

81
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:48,160
the easy question like how's quarantine

82
00:02:48,160 --> 00:02:51,120
going so far like is everyone completely

83
00:02:51,120 --> 00:02:52,000
stir crazy

84
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:54,959
yet or what i mean i guess that's an

85
00:02:54,959 --> 00:02:56,879
easy question

86
00:02:56,879 --> 00:03:00,720
um yeah so um i'm in a bit of a unique

87
00:03:00,720 --> 00:03:02,159
situation i'm actually on maternity

88
00:03:02,159 --> 00:03:03,519
leave

89
00:03:03,519 --> 00:03:06,800
i have a nine-week-old son um

90
00:03:06,800 --> 00:03:09,840
and a two-year-old daughter so we

91
00:03:09,840 --> 00:03:13,519
are just getting through

92
00:03:13,519 --> 00:03:16,080
but pretty soon i'll have to start

93
00:03:16,080 --> 00:03:17,840
balancing that with working from home

94
00:03:17,840 --> 00:03:18,879
and that will be

95
00:03:18,879 --> 00:03:21,360
an interesting picture as well but um

96
00:03:21,360 --> 00:03:22,560
yeah trying to uh

97
00:03:22,560 --> 00:03:24,480
get a two-year-old's energy out for the

98
00:03:24,480 --> 00:03:26,400
day has been rough

99
00:03:26,400 --> 00:03:28,879
um and her not understanding why we

100
00:03:28,879 --> 00:03:30,720
can't go see grandma and grandpa or

101
00:03:30,720 --> 00:03:33,680
her cousins so um yeah we're definitely

102
00:03:33,680 --> 00:03:34,959
feeling being stuck

103
00:03:34,959 --> 00:03:38,560
inside for sure yeah same here

104
00:03:38,560 --> 00:03:40,879
same here um i have a five five-year-old

105
00:03:40,879 --> 00:03:42,080
and a three-year-old

106
00:03:42,080 --> 00:03:43,920
uh and so they're just like at least

107
00:03:43,920 --> 00:03:44,959
they have each other to play with but

108
00:03:44,959 --> 00:03:46,799
they're just bouncing off the walls

109
00:03:46,799 --> 00:03:48,959
uh every day trying to make sure that we

110
00:03:48,959 --> 00:03:50,480
keep them entertained

111
00:03:50,480 --> 00:03:52,400
uh they have like assignments and

112
00:03:52,400 --> 00:03:53,519
everything that they're getting from

113
00:03:53,519 --> 00:03:54,799
school that we're trying to help them

114
00:03:54,799 --> 00:03:56,080
with but

115
00:03:56,080 --> 00:03:57,760
my wife and i are kind of alternating

116
00:03:57,760 --> 00:03:59,200
where i'll

117
00:03:59,200 --> 00:04:00,799
i'll be working in the morning and she's

118
00:04:00,799 --> 00:04:02,640
watching them and then in the afternoon

119
00:04:02,640 --> 00:04:03,519
she's working and

120
00:04:03,519 --> 00:04:06,319
and i'm watching them and so uh there's

121
00:04:06,319 --> 00:04:06,879
always that

122
00:04:06,879 --> 00:04:08,159
that you know kids there's always that

123
00:04:08,159 --> 00:04:10,959
competition for who gets the attention

124
00:04:10,959 --> 00:04:12,480
yeah we're sort of in a similar boat and

125
00:04:12,480 --> 00:04:13,920
i think one of the things that sort of

126
00:04:13,920 --> 00:04:15,599
like uh drove me to

127
00:04:15,599 --> 00:04:17,759
sort of think about this was uh so i've

128
00:04:17,759 --> 00:04:19,279
got a uh eight-year-old and a

129
00:04:19,279 --> 00:04:20,160
five-year-old

130
00:04:20,160 --> 00:04:22,240
and uh they're doing the homeschooling

131
00:04:22,240 --> 00:04:23,199
thing now

132
00:04:23,199 --> 00:04:26,880
and uh it's amazing but at work

133
00:04:26,880 --> 00:04:29,680
there there's clearly like you know two

134
00:04:29,680 --> 00:04:31,759
sides of the equation right there's

135
00:04:31,759 --> 00:04:34,880
um people that have kids right and

136
00:04:34,880 --> 00:04:36,479
uh the people that have kids are really

137
00:04:36,479 --> 00:04:38,240
struggling because

138
00:04:38,240 --> 00:04:40,720
they're not able to keep up because all

139
00:04:40,720 --> 00:04:42,400
of these different facets of life right

140
00:04:42,400 --> 00:04:42,880
so

141
00:04:42,880 --> 00:04:45,040
you know now at home i have this sort of

142
00:04:45,040 --> 00:04:46,400
intersectionality that never really

143
00:04:46,400 --> 00:04:48,000
existed before i have to be

144
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:50,880
a parent i have to be a teacher i have

145
00:04:50,880 --> 00:04:52,240
to be a manager

146
00:04:52,240 --> 00:04:54,560
i have to be an employee i have to be a

147
00:04:54,560 --> 00:04:55,280
spouse

148
00:04:55,280 --> 00:04:56,800
and i have to do it all within this

149
00:04:56,800 --> 00:04:58,479
little home office here

150
00:04:58,479 --> 00:05:01,759
right like i used to be able to uh

151
00:05:01,759 --> 00:05:03,520
you know get on a train and leave one

152
00:05:03,520 --> 00:05:04,800
persona and

153
00:05:04,800 --> 00:05:08,000
adopt the other and i've been really

154
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:10,720
really struggling with that transition

155
00:05:10,720 --> 00:05:11,440
um

156
00:05:11,440 --> 00:05:14,000
so you know i'm curious how you're

157
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:15,840
handling sort of moving through these

158
00:05:15,840 --> 00:05:16,479
spaces

159
00:05:16,479 --> 00:05:20,159
really quickly throughout the day

160
00:05:21,280 --> 00:05:23,280
yeah that's a that's a great question i

161
00:05:23,280 --> 00:05:24,479
i think um

162
00:05:24,479 --> 00:05:26,800
you know for me even even during the the

163
00:05:26,800 --> 00:05:28,479
times when i'm supposed to be

164
00:05:28,479 --> 00:05:30,160
working if i had come downstairs for

165
00:05:30,160 --> 00:05:32,080
something and i see that both kids are

166
00:05:32,080 --> 00:05:32,720
like

167
00:05:32,720 --> 00:05:34,320
fighting for my wife's attention then

168
00:05:34,320 --> 00:05:35,759
i'll usually have to like

169
00:05:35,759 --> 00:05:37,840
take a break stop work with one of them

170
00:05:37,840 --> 00:05:39,440
to kind of get them settled

171
00:05:39,440 --> 00:05:41,120
and working on something and then go

172
00:05:41,120 --> 00:05:42,720
back um

173
00:05:42,720 --> 00:05:45,680
and so and i like you i really used to

174
00:05:45,680 --> 00:05:47,759
enjoy having that division

175
00:05:47,759 --> 00:05:49,280
between like when i'm doing stuff at

176
00:05:49,280 --> 00:05:51,039
work when i'm home and can kind of

177
00:05:51,039 --> 00:05:53,440
focus on on the family and everything

178
00:05:53,440 --> 00:05:55,199
else that needs to be done

179
00:05:55,199 --> 00:05:57,759
um because even though we were even

180
00:05:57,759 --> 00:05:59,120
though most of the company works

181
00:05:59,120 --> 00:06:00,000
remotely

182
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:02,639
uh we have an office and so i was always

183
00:06:02,639 --> 00:06:03,680
going into the office

184
00:06:03,680 --> 00:06:05,280
because that just that was just an

185
00:06:05,280 --> 00:06:07,440
easier easier division for me even

186
00:06:07,440 --> 00:06:08,960
though the kids were at school it still

187
00:06:08,960 --> 00:06:10,160
helped me to kind of

188
00:06:10,160 --> 00:06:12,720
get away from the house uh do stuff

189
00:06:12,720 --> 00:06:14,240
there and then go home

190
00:06:14,240 --> 00:06:17,120
uh and so it there just isn't that that

191
00:06:17,120 --> 00:06:17,600
same

192
00:06:17,600 --> 00:06:21,039
ability to create that space anymore

193
00:06:21,039 --> 00:06:22,720
right and i'm even having trouble just

194
00:06:22,720 --> 00:06:24,639
distinguishing between the days right

195
00:06:24,639 --> 00:06:26,000
you know like

196
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:27,840
um you know did i wear this shirt

197
00:06:27,840 --> 00:06:29,440
yesterday like i'm trying to remember

198
00:06:29,440 --> 00:06:32,720
like did i shower today

199
00:06:32,720 --> 00:06:35,680
right i mean that stuff is is real um

200
00:06:35,680 --> 00:06:36,720
and also you know

201
00:06:36,720 --> 00:06:39,199
my kids are at an age so my my spouse um

202
00:06:39,199 --> 00:06:40,800
is a stay-at-home dad

203
00:06:40,800 --> 00:06:43,039
um so my child care actually is in the

204
00:06:43,039 --> 00:06:44,160
house which is

205
00:06:44,160 --> 00:06:47,680
uh amazing but um you know both of our

206
00:06:47,680 --> 00:06:48,080
children

207
00:06:48,080 --> 00:06:49,759
are kind of at an age where they need

208
00:06:49,759 --> 00:06:52,000
attention 24 7.

209
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:55,599
you know like there has to be someone

210
00:06:55,599 --> 00:06:57,120
with one of them all the time so we're

211
00:06:57,120 --> 00:06:59,039
kind of both on

212
00:06:59,039 --> 00:07:01,520
24 7 on parenting duties and we have to

213
00:07:01,520 --> 00:07:03,440
remember to be spouses sometimes and we

214
00:07:03,440 --> 00:07:05,759
have to remember to be alone sometimes

215
00:07:05,759 --> 00:07:08,400
um and that can be hard in a in a small

216
00:07:08,400 --> 00:07:09,599
space so

217
00:07:09,599 --> 00:07:11,120
you know we're trying to work on that

218
00:07:11,120 --> 00:07:12,560
before i have to go back to work and

219
00:07:12,560 --> 00:07:14,160
then start throwing in that

220
00:07:14,160 --> 00:07:17,120
that co-worker plea piece as well so

221
00:07:17,120 --> 00:07:18,080
we'll see

222
00:07:18,080 --> 00:07:19,759
it's funny how the grass is always a

223
00:07:19,759 --> 00:07:21,120
little greener right because i have

224
00:07:21,120 --> 00:07:22,240
friends that are single

225
00:07:22,240 --> 00:07:24,000
and and they're quarantined alone and

226
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:26,319
they're like desperate they're starving

227
00:07:26,319 --> 00:07:26,639
for

228
00:07:26,639 --> 00:07:28,720
human contact right where i'm on the

229
00:07:28,720 --> 00:07:30,880
other side of that and i'm like man

230
00:07:30,880 --> 00:07:33,280
what i would give to be at home just for

231
00:07:33,280 --> 00:07:34,639
a little bit

232
00:07:34,639 --> 00:07:37,840
right what's funny is that i find that

233
00:07:37,840 --> 00:07:39,840
my social calendar is almost

234
00:07:39,840 --> 00:07:42,960
more loaded now than it was previously

235
00:07:42,960 --> 00:07:43,680
between

236
00:07:43,680 --> 00:07:45,680
zoom meetings to hang out like video

237
00:07:45,680 --> 00:07:47,759
game sessions sometimes i really do just

238
00:07:47,759 --> 00:07:49,199
have to stop and say like you know what

239
00:07:49,199 --> 00:07:50,879
i need to be alone in my feelings for a

240
00:07:50,879 --> 00:07:51,360
little bit

241
00:07:51,360 --> 00:07:53,280
i need to be able to process this

242
00:07:53,280 --> 00:07:54,479
because one

243
00:07:54,479 --> 00:07:56,400
as a as a parent you know i mean you're

244
00:07:56,400 --> 00:07:58,240
trying to put up the good face

245
00:07:58,240 --> 00:08:01,840
um but that gets a little bit exhausting

246
00:08:01,840 --> 00:08:02,960
after a bit of time

247
00:08:02,960 --> 00:08:05,360
so um you know what what are you guys

248
00:08:05,360 --> 00:08:06,160
doing or

249
00:08:06,160 --> 00:08:07,599
do you guys have like a routine where

250
00:08:07,599 --> 00:08:09,199
you're sort of decompressing on a daily

251
00:08:09,199 --> 00:08:09,680
basis

252
00:08:09,680 --> 00:08:12,080
do you guys have a strategy for coping

253
00:08:12,080 --> 00:08:13,520
with it because right now i'm i'm

254
00:08:13,520 --> 00:08:15,199
literally just like you know what

255
00:08:15,199 --> 00:08:16,639
i'm going to go play some video games

256
00:08:16,639 --> 00:08:19,680
and my wife's just like okay

257
00:08:19,680 --> 00:08:23,199
okay yeah i mean i think my current

258
00:08:23,199 --> 00:08:24,960
strategy is going to need some adjusting

259
00:08:24,960 --> 00:08:26,080
soon um

260
00:08:26,080 --> 00:08:28,080
right now we're kind of my spouse and i

261
00:08:28,080 --> 00:08:30,240
are sort of splitting the

262
00:08:30,240 --> 00:08:32,000
the late night shift and the early

263
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:34,479
morning shift where like one of us is

264
00:08:34,479 --> 00:08:36,080
asleep while the other one's kind of

265
00:08:36,080 --> 00:08:36,719
just

266
00:08:36,719 --> 00:08:39,440
alone and like enjoying the quiet with

267
00:08:39,440 --> 00:08:40,799
no kids

268
00:08:40,799 --> 00:08:44,000
um but that's not gonna be sustainable

269
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:45,360
when i have to start

270
00:08:45,360 --> 00:08:48,480
you know having slept and and uh talking

271
00:08:48,480 --> 00:08:49,839
to people at 9am

272
00:08:49,839 --> 00:08:51,040
because right now i'm on the late night

273
00:08:51,040 --> 00:08:54,320
shift so i'm up until

274
00:08:54,320 --> 00:08:57,200
maybe like three or four a.m and i'm

275
00:08:57,200 --> 00:08:58,000
there if

276
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:00,640
well when the different kids wake up and

277
00:09:00,640 --> 00:09:02,399
then i go to bed and sleep late and then

278
00:09:02,399 --> 00:09:04,399
my spouse has a quiet morning

279
00:09:04,399 --> 00:09:06,880
um but we're gonna have to we're gonna

280
00:09:06,880 --> 00:09:08,240
figure something out

281
00:09:08,240 --> 00:09:10,399
otherwise my the infant is actually

282
00:09:10,399 --> 00:09:11,440
sleeping through the night which is

283
00:09:11,440 --> 00:09:14,480
amazing but nobody told the two-year-old

284
00:09:14,480 --> 00:09:17,040
that that would be a nice thing to do so

285
00:09:17,040 --> 00:09:18,240
we're working on it

286
00:09:18,240 --> 00:09:20,240
so we got a few questions coming in uh

287
00:09:20,240 --> 00:09:21,680
one will we take the opportunity to make

288
00:09:21,680 --> 00:09:22,640
the kind of change to

289
00:09:22,640 --> 00:09:24,320
modern work we all know it's necessary

290
00:09:24,320 --> 00:09:25,920
and only now possible or are we gonna

291
00:09:25,920 --> 00:09:27,519
fall back into the familiar and the

292
00:09:27,519 --> 00:09:28,399
broken

293
00:09:28,399 --> 00:09:31,120
um and i think such a strong question

294
00:09:31,120 --> 00:09:32,000
because

295
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:35,279
um we

296
00:09:35,279 --> 00:09:37,440
we're starting to recognize how some of

297
00:09:37,440 --> 00:09:39,440
this is sort of unsustainable right and

298
00:09:39,440 --> 00:09:40,959
i don't know that anyone is openly

299
00:09:40,959 --> 00:09:42,080
saying it like we

300
00:09:42,080 --> 00:09:43,600
we talk about it in our little circles

301
00:09:43,600 --> 00:09:45,279
but i don't know that anyone's up front

302
00:09:45,279 --> 00:09:47,120
and forward and saying like listen this

303
00:09:47,120 --> 00:09:49,519
this can't be done because everyone is

304
00:09:49,519 --> 00:09:50,560
expecting that

305
00:09:50,560 --> 00:09:52,160
i'm not doing anything about this other

306
00:09:52,160 --> 00:09:54,800
thing right my schools think like oh

307
00:09:54,800 --> 00:09:56,320
you know you're at home not doing

308
00:09:56,320 --> 00:09:58,399
anything so i can change the school

309
00:09:58,399 --> 00:10:00,240
schedule 15 minutes before class and

310
00:10:00,240 --> 00:10:01,600
it's not going to be a problem

311
00:10:01,600 --> 00:10:04,399
um so i i think you know there's going

312
00:10:04,399 --> 00:10:06,160
to be a deep examination in some

313
00:10:06,160 --> 00:10:07,440
companies other companies it'll be

314
00:10:07,440 --> 00:10:08,800
business as usual but the really good

315
00:10:08,800 --> 00:10:10,079
ones i think are going to take this time

316
00:10:10,079 --> 00:10:11,120
to sort of reflect

317
00:10:11,120 --> 00:10:13,360
and figure out what they can do to to

318
00:10:13,360 --> 00:10:14,720
support people a bit better what are

319
00:10:14,720 --> 00:10:16,720
your thoughts

320
00:10:16,720 --> 00:10:19,040
uh i would hope that there's some kind

321
00:10:19,040 --> 00:10:20,320
of re-examination

322
00:10:20,320 --> 00:10:22,480
of of that sort i i'm kind of

323
00:10:22,480 --> 00:10:23,680
pessimistic about it i

324
00:10:23,680 --> 00:10:24,959
don't know that a lot of companies are

325
00:10:24,959 --> 00:10:26,720
really going to uh

326
00:10:26,720 --> 00:10:29,040
want to want to stay like this where

327
00:10:29,040 --> 00:10:30,160
they kind of give the

328
00:10:30,160 --> 00:10:32,160
employees the kind of freedom that they

329
00:10:32,160 --> 00:10:33,760
they know they might need to work at

330
00:10:33,760 --> 00:10:35,680
home or to have these like more flexible

331
00:10:35,680 --> 00:10:36,800
schedules

332
00:10:36,800 --> 00:10:40,480
um but i do i do think there's going to

333
00:10:40,480 --> 00:10:43,760
be a whole lot more appreciation for

334
00:10:44,839 --> 00:10:46,000
teachers

335
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:49,279
um i i would pay my teachers i would pay

336
00:10:49,279 --> 00:10:51,200
my kids teachers as much as they want at

337
00:10:51,200 --> 00:10:52,160
this point

338
00:10:52,160 --> 00:10:55,360
um because it is a lot um and

339
00:10:55,360 --> 00:10:57,279
you know it's been three four weeks now

340
00:10:57,279 --> 00:10:58,959
that they've been home and doing

341
00:10:58,959 --> 00:11:00,480
assignments and you know my daughter is

342
00:11:00,480 --> 00:11:01,920
in kindergarten so it's not

343
00:11:01,920 --> 00:11:03,120
it's not like they're doing anything

344
00:11:03,120 --> 00:11:05,200
super difficult um it's not like she's

345
00:11:05,200 --> 00:11:06,880
missing anything that's you know

346
00:11:06,880 --> 00:11:08,800
so crucial that i think that can't be

347
00:11:08,800 --> 00:11:10,480
made up um

348
00:11:10,480 --> 00:11:13,040
but it's still you kind of see you you

349
00:11:13,040 --> 00:11:15,360
appreciate how much work goes into it

350
00:11:15,360 --> 00:11:18,880
a little bit more um and so

351
00:11:18,880 --> 00:11:21,760
you know i i saw i saw some tweet um a

352
00:11:21,760 --> 00:11:22,880
couple weeks ago

353
00:11:22,880 --> 00:11:25,200
where it kind of showed how so many

354
00:11:25,200 --> 00:11:27,279
things that we take for granted as these

355
00:11:27,279 --> 00:11:29,440
like really important rules

356
00:11:29,440 --> 00:11:32,079
of society are are just made up

357
00:11:32,079 --> 00:11:33,040
essentially

358
00:11:33,040 --> 00:11:37,279
um and and they do deserve to be

359
00:11:37,279 --> 00:11:40,240
to be reassessed um because i think they

360
00:11:40,240 --> 00:11:41,760
even in good times they don't work for a

361
00:11:41,760 --> 00:11:43,760
lot of people and so i think now really

362
00:11:43,760 --> 00:11:47,279
helps help show that yeah i think i'm

363
00:11:47,279 --> 00:11:48,160
i'm having a

364
00:11:48,160 --> 00:11:49,920
sort of a daily struggle between the

365
00:11:49,920 --> 00:11:51,839
optimist and pessimist in me i really

366
00:11:51,839 --> 00:11:52,720
hope

367
00:11:52,720 --> 00:11:54,399
that people are re-examining some of

368
00:11:54,399 --> 00:11:56,880
these um sort of arbitrary

369
00:11:56,880 --> 00:11:59,680
structures we have in place and um

370
00:11:59,680 --> 00:12:01,120
another part of me thinks that people

371
00:12:01,120 --> 00:12:02,480
have a really short memory you know

372
00:12:02,480 --> 00:12:04,000
everyone's saying they appreciate their

373
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:05,360
teachers but when we come

374
00:12:05,360 --> 00:12:07,040
time to say okay let's raise taxes and

375
00:12:07,040 --> 00:12:08,639
pay them more i don't know how many

376
00:12:08,639 --> 00:12:10,079
people are gonna

377
00:12:10,079 --> 00:12:12,800
you know remember um you know what they

378
00:12:12,800 --> 00:12:14,399
were saying so

379
00:12:14,399 --> 00:12:16,240
you know i i am hopeful that there are

380
00:12:16,240 --> 00:12:17,680
some companies that can at least

381
00:12:17,680 --> 00:12:19,839
see like oh man you know we saved a lot

382
00:12:19,839 --> 00:12:21,200
of money not putting uh

383
00:12:21,200 --> 00:12:23,120
electricity in that building every day

384
00:12:23,120 --> 00:12:24,399
so maybe

385
00:12:24,399 --> 00:12:26,079
once a week we have everybody work from

386
00:12:26,079 --> 00:12:27,600
home or something but

387
00:12:27,600 --> 00:12:29,600
you know i'm hoping that the people

388
00:12:29,600 --> 00:12:31,200
start to realize that

389
00:12:31,200 --> 00:12:35,040
you know 40 hours nine to five is um

390
00:12:35,040 --> 00:12:37,680
is is arbitrary and that that maybe

391
00:12:37,680 --> 00:12:39,440
there can be more flexibility especially

392
00:12:39,440 --> 00:12:40,480
for

393
00:12:40,480 --> 00:12:43,519
um you know folks who are trying to

394
00:12:43,519 --> 00:12:45,760
balance other things in their life you

395
00:12:45,760 --> 00:12:47,200
know one of the things we always talk

396
00:12:47,200 --> 00:12:48,160
about with

397
00:12:48,160 --> 00:12:51,279
diversity in tech is you know

398
00:12:51,279 --> 00:12:54,800
making things accessible for parents um

399
00:12:54,800 --> 00:12:56,720
you know if you want to have people who

400
00:12:56,720 --> 00:12:58,399
are are working parents

401
00:12:58,399 --> 00:13:01,839
uh also staying in in the space then

402
00:13:01,839 --> 00:13:03,920
they need some some flexibility for

403
00:13:03,920 --> 00:13:05,200
things like

404
00:13:05,200 --> 00:13:07,760
you know my school gets out at three or

405
00:13:07,760 --> 00:13:09,920
or whatever it is

406
00:13:09,920 --> 00:13:13,279
right absolutely um this was more of a

407
00:13:13,279 --> 00:13:14,160
comment

408
00:13:14,160 --> 00:13:16,639
but i thought it was uh something

409
00:13:16,639 --> 00:13:17,920
worthwhile to talk about with work from

410
00:13:17,920 --> 00:13:19,440
home context switching takes on new

411
00:13:19,440 --> 00:13:20,959
meaning we need to set boundaries let

412
00:13:20,959 --> 00:13:22,639
others know what they are

413
00:13:22,639 --> 00:13:24,639
and i think the the key point of that

414
00:13:24,639 --> 00:13:26,079
statement is and let others know what

415
00:13:26,079 --> 00:13:27,680
they are because let's be clear right

416
00:13:27,680 --> 00:13:29,680
your slack status don't mean anything to

417
00:13:29,680 --> 00:13:30,959
anybody

418
00:13:30,959 --> 00:13:33,600
right like like oh you're busy like

419
00:13:33,600 --> 00:13:35,440
starving a fire yeah well i just need to

420
00:13:35,440 --> 00:13:36,000
know the

421
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:38,000
the build failed and i need help with

422
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:39,760
that right um

423
00:13:39,760 --> 00:13:42,240
so you know i think it's important that

424
00:13:42,240 --> 00:13:44,160
we sort of let folks know what the

425
00:13:44,160 --> 00:13:45,040
boundaries are

426
00:13:45,040 --> 00:13:47,920
right like you know we see these uh

427
00:13:47,920 --> 00:13:49,839
signals sort of get eroded over time and

428
00:13:49,839 --> 00:13:51,440
we never really push back on it remember

429
00:13:51,440 --> 00:13:53,040
when the headphones was a thing

430
00:13:53,040 --> 00:13:57,360
right again no i don't remember

431
00:13:57,360 --> 00:13:58,800
now that you tap you on your headphones

432
00:13:58,800 --> 00:14:02,160
like hey you busy

433
00:14:02,160 --> 00:14:03,680
i hope nobody ever taps me on my

434
00:14:03,680 --> 00:14:05,680
headphones that would be that same that

435
00:14:05,680 --> 00:14:08,638
seems disrespectful

436
00:14:09,279 --> 00:14:10,560
so what are some ways that we can sort

437
00:14:10,560 --> 00:14:12,079
of communicate our boundaries in a way

438
00:14:12,079 --> 00:14:13,760
that's like firm but at the same time

439
00:14:13,760 --> 00:14:14,079
not

440
00:14:14,079 --> 00:14:17,839
uh aggressive that's a that's a really

441
00:14:17,839 --> 00:14:18,800
good question i think

442
00:14:18,800 --> 00:14:21,440
um you know part of that is at an

443
00:14:21,440 --> 00:14:22,959
individual level and part of that's

444
00:14:22,959 --> 00:14:23,680
going to have to

445
00:14:23,680 --> 00:14:26,880
be at a a culture level uh for for each

446
00:14:26,880 --> 00:14:27,760
company

447
00:14:27,760 --> 00:14:30,000
um you know i think that individuals can

448
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:31,760
advocate for themselves and say

449
00:14:31,760 --> 00:14:34,720
you know hey these are my structures and

450
00:14:34,720 --> 00:14:35,120
so

451
00:14:35,120 --> 00:14:37,760
it depending on what works best for you

452
00:14:37,760 --> 00:14:38,399
it could be

453
00:14:38,399 --> 00:14:40,079
hey i'm going to be really serious about

454
00:14:40,079 --> 00:14:42,079
my slack status or

455
00:14:42,079 --> 00:14:44,320
hey these are my hours that i'm you know

456
00:14:44,320 --> 00:14:46,240
on kid duty and these are my hours that

457
00:14:46,240 --> 00:14:46,639
i'm

458
00:14:46,639 --> 00:14:49,040
available um you know it will be

459
00:14:49,040 --> 00:14:50,399
different for everyone what that looks

460
00:14:50,399 --> 00:14:51,279
like

461
00:14:51,279 --> 00:14:54,560
um but then i think it's also up to

462
00:14:54,560 --> 00:14:58,000
the the company culture to kind of step

463
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:00,240
up and and respect those boundaries

464
00:15:00,240 --> 00:15:01,279
right like there's not going to be

465
00:15:01,279 --> 00:15:03,600
anyone who's like enforcing it

466
00:15:03,600 --> 00:15:06,480
um except for each other right so the

467
00:15:06,480 --> 00:15:07,760
hope is that

468
00:15:07,760 --> 00:15:10,560
that people can um be clear with their

469
00:15:10,560 --> 00:15:11,440
colleagues and then

470
00:15:11,440 --> 00:15:15,120
also respect each other's boundaries but

471
00:15:15,120 --> 00:15:18,480
i don't know i don't know the uh

472
00:15:18,480 --> 00:15:21,519
the larger answer to that right yeah i

473
00:15:21,519 --> 00:15:21,839
think

474
00:15:21,839 --> 00:15:23,680
um one thing that i think that my my

475
00:15:23,680 --> 00:15:25,600
company did really well early on

476
00:15:25,600 --> 00:15:28,160
was that they the the chief of staff

477
00:15:28,160 --> 00:15:28,800
there

478
00:15:28,800 --> 00:15:30,639
made it really clear a lot of people

479
00:15:30,639 --> 00:15:32,000
that work there are parents

480
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:35,360
um and they're going to have uh they're

481
00:15:35,360 --> 00:15:36,399
going to have times when they're just

482
00:15:36,399 --> 00:15:37,759
unavailable

483
00:15:37,759 --> 00:15:40,079
and i think a lot of a lot of us have

484
00:15:40,079 --> 00:15:42,079
tried really hard to make it clear to

485
00:15:42,079 --> 00:15:43,120
everybody else

486
00:15:43,120 --> 00:15:44,880
when we're going to be watching the kids

487
00:15:44,880 --> 00:15:46,320
we're not going to be able to respond

488
00:15:46,320 --> 00:15:47,360
very quickly

489
00:15:47,360 --> 00:15:50,560
um you know we'll try to as we get uh

490
00:15:50,560 --> 00:15:53,720
but there may be a period of four hours

491
00:15:53,720 --> 00:15:55,120
foreign so

492
00:15:55,120 --> 00:15:57,040
if you need something then you need to

493
00:15:57,040 --> 00:15:58,160
ask it before

494
00:15:58,160 --> 00:15:59,759
that time or you need to ask it after

495
00:15:59,759 --> 00:16:01,519
that time because um

496
00:16:01,519 --> 00:16:05,279
kids don't care about your boundaries

497
00:16:05,279 --> 00:16:08,880
and so one thing i i tried to do with uh

498
00:16:08,880 --> 00:16:10,959
my team uh the people that i'm managing

499
00:16:10,959 --> 00:16:12,000
is make sure

500
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:13,759
every morning i was trying to put it in

501
00:16:13,759 --> 00:16:15,759
the slacks in my slack status which

502
00:16:15,759 --> 00:16:17,360
hours i'd be available like

503
00:16:17,360 --> 00:16:19,040
you know i'll be online until one and

504
00:16:19,040 --> 00:16:21,120
then after that i won't be available or

505
00:16:21,120 --> 00:16:22,560
i'm out in the morning and i'll be

506
00:16:22,560 --> 00:16:24,959
available between like one and four

507
00:16:24,959 --> 00:16:28,399
um and also uh put that same message

508
00:16:28,399 --> 00:16:28,800
like

509
00:16:28,800 --> 00:16:30,639
in the in the main slack channel so that

510
00:16:30,639 --> 00:16:32,639
people would know um

511
00:16:32,639 --> 00:16:34,800
and just try to try to stick to that as

512
00:16:34,800 --> 00:16:36,720
much as possible like if i if i can help

513
00:16:36,720 --> 00:16:37,600
out with something

514
00:16:37,600 --> 00:16:40,399
then i will but um you know people kind

515
00:16:40,399 --> 00:16:40,720
of

516
00:16:40,720 --> 00:16:44,000
need to know that other things are

517
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:47,040
going to take the precedence over them

518
00:16:47,040 --> 00:16:49,680
yeah i think it's also oh sorry i'm just

519
00:16:49,680 --> 00:16:50,959
gonna say i think it's also good to

520
00:16:50,959 --> 00:16:52,639
establish kind of amongst the team like

521
00:16:52,639 --> 00:16:54,480
what constitutes an emergency and what

522
00:16:54,480 --> 00:16:55,440
doesn't

523
00:16:55,440 --> 00:16:58,079
just so people kind of know like when is

524
00:16:58,079 --> 00:16:59,519
even an okay time to

525
00:16:59,519 --> 00:17:00,880
to send me a message even though you

526
00:17:00,880 --> 00:17:03,199
know i'm not on

527
00:17:03,199 --> 00:17:05,119
like whether to even be asking me to try

528
00:17:05,119 --> 00:17:07,119
to come to it at some point

529
00:17:07,119 --> 00:17:10,160
right yep um another question came in

530
00:17:10,160 --> 00:17:11,280
have you seen good practices

531
00:17:11,280 --> 00:17:13,039
companies help employees cope with the

532
00:17:13,039 --> 00:17:14,720
quarantine um

533
00:17:14,720 --> 00:17:16,480
so you know it's interesting because i

534
00:17:16,480 --> 00:17:18,000
i've been talking with people about this

535
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:19,760
specifically to try to get ideas that

536
00:17:19,760 --> 00:17:21,039
that i could you know leverage and

537
00:17:21,039 --> 00:17:22,400
utilize with my team and

538
00:17:22,400 --> 00:17:24,160
what i've noticed is that there is never

539
00:17:24,160 --> 00:17:26,160
really been a company-wide strategy it's

540
00:17:26,160 --> 00:17:27,919
really been leader by leader

541
00:17:27,919 --> 00:17:30,400
um and different leaders have different

542
00:17:30,400 --> 00:17:31,600
expectations

543
00:17:31,600 --> 00:17:34,640
so um like you know my wife had an

544
00:17:34,640 --> 00:17:35,840
exchange with a leader in her

545
00:17:35,840 --> 00:17:37,440
organization that was

546
00:17:37,440 --> 00:17:39,120
that and the statement was basically

547
00:17:39,120 --> 00:17:40,559
like you know well it's a business as

548
00:17:40,559 --> 00:17:41,280
usual

549
00:17:41,280 --> 00:17:43,840
right and she's like uh no it ain't

550
00:17:43,840 --> 00:17:44,640
right

551
00:17:44,640 --> 00:17:47,280
um but at the same time you know i've

552
00:17:47,280 --> 00:17:48,480
talked with other leaders where they're

553
00:17:48,480 --> 00:17:49,280
going to

554
00:17:49,280 --> 00:17:50,880
through great pains to make sure that

555
00:17:50,880 --> 00:17:52,720
their staff feels comfortable

556
00:17:52,720 --> 00:17:54,480
you know saying like hey i just need to

557
00:17:54,480 --> 00:17:55,760
get away for a little bit

558
00:17:55,760 --> 00:17:58,559
or you know uh being extra flexible with

559
00:17:58,559 --> 00:17:59,280
the schedule

560
00:17:59,280 --> 00:18:01,200
so that's the only thing i've really

561
00:18:01,200 --> 00:18:02,799
been able to do as a leader myself is

562
00:18:02,799 --> 00:18:04,000
just like you know

563
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:05,919
make sure that it's flexible uh make

564
00:18:05,919 --> 00:18:07,120
sure that people know

565
00:18:07,120 --> 00:18:09,520
like this is not normal and it's okay

566
00:18:09,520 --> 00:18:11,039
for it to not be normal

567
00:18:11,039 --> 00:18:12,960
um you know sometimes we need a mental

568
00:18:12,960 --> 00:18:14,160
health day right some

569
00:18:14,160 --> 00:18:15,840
you know depending on your situation you

570
00:18:15,840 --> 00:18:17,840
just need to be able to step away

571
00:18:17,840 --> 00:18:19,280
so i think one thing that i've tried to

572
00:18:19,280 --> 00:18:21,120
do is be as open and honest about my

573
00:18:21,120 --> 00:18:22,799
situation as possible

574
00:18:22,799 --> 00:18:24,559
just to sort of set an example where

575
00:18:24,559 --> 00:18:26,559
it's like well if jeff

576
00:18:26,559 --> 00:18:28,320
said it was okay for him to walk with

577
00:18:28,320 --> 00:18:30,320
his kids from 3 30 to 4 30 around the

578
00:18:30,320 --> 00:18:31,200
block

579
00:18:31,200 --> 00:18:33,919
you know maybe i can take that time too

580
00:18:33,919 --> 00:18:35,120
yeah absolutely i think

581
00:18:35,120 --> 00:18:37,760
um you know leaders demonstrating the

582
00:18:37,760 --> 00:18:38,559
need for that

583
00:18:38,559 --> 00:18:40,840
flexibility i think is huge you know if

584
00:18:40,840 --> 00:18:42,880
your boss is always

585
00:18:42,880 --> 00:18:46,000
um you know working at midnight

586
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:47,760
it doesn't make it seem like it's okay

587
00:18:47,760 --> 00:18:49,360
for you to you know

588
00:18:49,360 --> 00:18:52,240
go to sleep um but in terms of

589
00:18:52,240 --> 00:18:54,320
company-wide things i think

590
00:18:54,320 --> 00:18:56,400
you know there are at least some

591
00:18:56,400 --> 00:18:58,480
resources that can be made available

592
00:18:58,480 --> 00:19:01,520
i know um you know at uh at central we

593
00:19:01,520 --> 00:19:02,880
have um

594
00:19:02,880 --> 00:19:06,080
uh access to uh a meditation app

595
00:19:06,080 --> 00:19:08,799
and um there's a there's a resource for

596
00:19:08,799 --> 00:19:09,360
parents

597
00:19:09,360 --> 00:19:13,360
where there's all kinds of free

598
00:19:13,360 --> 00:19:14,960
like doctor's appointments you can have

599
00:19:14,960 --> 00:19:17,679
so you can meet with

600
00:19:17,679 --> 00:19:19,760
you know a physical therapist after

601
00:19:19,760 --> 00:19:21,840
you've given birth or you can meet with

602
00:19:21,840 --> 00:19:23,600
someone about

603
00:19:23,600 --> 00:19:25,600
transitioning into going back to work

604
00:19:25,600 --> 00:19:27,679
and things like that and they're all

605
00:19:27,679 --> 00:19:29,200
online things that you can have for free

606
00:19:29,200 --> 00:19:32,400
so it's more having those resources and

607
00:19:32,400 --> 00:19:34,960
encouraging people to use them but you

608
00:19:34,960 --> 00:19:36,559
know in terms of uh

609
00:19:36,559 --> 00:19:38,240
overall i think you're right that that

610
00:19:38,240 --> 00:19:40,240
the leadership example is going to be

611
00:19:40,240 --> 00:19:42,160
the biggest thing

612
00:19:42,160 --> 00:19:45,760
yeah totally agree all right uh next one

613
00:19:45,760 --> 00:19:47,039
we uh

614
00:19:47,039 --> 00:19:48,559
we all seem to be working harder as

615
00:19:48,559 --> 00:19:51,200
before time shifting how do we constrain

616
00:19:51,200 --> 00:19:52,000
ourselves and

617
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:53,919
you know this is this is a really good

618
00:19:53,919 --> 00:19:55,200
one because i

619
00:19:55,200 --> 00:19:58,240
i know for myself um for some reason

620
00:19:58,240 --> 00:20:01,919
i have this myth that i was working uh

621
00:20:01,919 --> 00:20:04,559
eight hours a day every day at the

622
00:20:04,559 --> 00:20:06,240
office right like oh yeah just eight

623
00:20:06,240 --> 00:20:08,000
hours of straight productivity right

624
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:11,520
and then i go home um so at home

625
00:20:11,520 --> 00:20:13,440
when i don't have those drive-bys and

626
00:20:13,440 --> 00:20:14,960
things like that um

627
00:20:14,960 --> 00:20:16,799
for some reason if i don't feel like

628
00:20:16,799 --> 00:20:18,159
i've been chained to my desk for eight

629
00:20:18,159 --> 00:20:20,640
hours i feel like i didn't do a full day

630
00:20:20,640 --> 00:20:22,159
and i feel guilty about that so i think

631
00:20:22,159 --> 00:20:23,760
part of it is being realistic about you

632
00:20:23,760 --> 00:20:24,960
know what it is that you were getting

633
00:20:24,960 --> 00:20:26,720
done before the pandemic

634
00:20:26,720 --> 00:20:29,120
with the drive-bys with the water cooler

635
00:20:29,120 --> 00:20:30,080
talk

636
00:20:30,080 --> 00:20:31,280
and then just setting realistic

637
00:20:31,280 --> 00:20:33,280
expectations like i love to

638
00:20:33,280 --> 00:20:35,200
start the morning off with a small

639
00:20:35,200 --> 00:20:36,640
checklist of things like hey

640
00:20:36,640 --> 00:20:39,120
if i get these three things done uh it's

641
00:20:39,120 --> 00:20:41,039
a gravy day now as soon as the day

642
00:20:41,039 --> 00:20:42,640
starts someone comes and craps all over

643
00:20:42,640 --> 00:20:45,120
that list

644
00:20:45,600 --> 00:20:49,760
but it's a goal right

645
00:20:49,760 --> 00:20:51,200
what are you guys doing to try to you

646
00:20:51,200 --> 00:20:53,760
know keep yourselves in check

647
00:20:53,760 --> 00:20:57,360
uh i think for for me i i've always felt

648
00:20:57,360 --> 00:20:58,080
like

649
00:20:58,080 --> 00:20:59,919
even even when i was doing more now it's

650
00:20:59,919 --> 00:21:01,360
mostly meetings that i'm in but

651
00:21:01,360 --> 00:21:03,360
even when i was able to be kind of in

652
00:21:03,360 --> 00:21:04,880
front of computer programming more i

653
00:21:04,880 --> 00:21:06,080
always felt like

654
00:21:06,080 --> 00:21:09,039
if i get like three three solid hours

655
00:21:09,039 --> 00:21:09,600
where i was

656
00:21:09,600 --> 00:21:11,120
actually you know in front of my

657
00:21:11,120 --> 00:21:12,960
computer typing then that was

658
00:21:12,960 --> 00:21:15,039
probably a good day um and i probably

659
00:21:15,039 --> 00:21:16,880
got like i was focused enough to get

660
00:21:16,880 --> 00:21:17,760
stuff done

661
00:21:17,760 --> 00:21:20,880
um and now it's mostly about it's

662
00:21:20,880 --> 00:21:22,880
similar to what you said trying to get

663
00:21:22,880 --> 00:21:25,039
a few things that i i know that i need

664
00:21:25,039 --> 00:21:26,480
to get accomplished and it's a lot of

665
00:21:26,480 --> 00:21:27,760
prioritization

666
00:21:27,760 --> 00:21:30,159
um there are some things that you know

667
00:21:30,159 --> 00:21:32,080
seemed important a few weeks ago that

668
00:21:32,080 --> 00:21:32,480
now

669
00:21:32,480 --> 00:21:35,280
i could not care less about um and so

670
00:21:35,280 --> 00:21:36,080
that's been

671
00:21:36,080 --> 00:21:37,679
that's been a really big part of it for

672
00:21:37,679 --> 00:21:39,520
me

673
00:21:39,520 --> 00:21:42,320
so getting on a a bit of a more personal

674
00:21:42,320 --> 00:21:42,720
note

675
00:21:42,720 --> 00:21:44,240
right like you know because we you know

676
00:21:44,240 --> 00:21:45,520
we've got the work side of things but

677
00:21:45,520 --> 00:21:46,960
there's also our personal lives that we

678
00:21:46,960 --> 00:21:47,760
sort of have to keep

679
00:21:47,760 --> 00:21:50,559
uh together how are you guys you know so

680
00:21:50,559 --> 00:21:52,080
let's assume that this thing goes on

681
00:21:52,080 --> 00:21:53,120
till july

682
00:21:53,120 --> 00:21:54,799
august right what are you guys doing

683
00:21:54,799 --> 00:21:56,559
with your partners to

684
00:21:56,559 --> 00:21:59,520
make a day special of any sort right

685
00:21:59,520 --> 00:22:00,080
like

686
00:22:00,080 --> 00:22:01,679
like how do you go about saying like you

687
00:22:01,679 --> 00:22:03,760
know oh we need a date night

688
00:22:03,760 --> 00:22:06,240
right and it's like okay ain't going

689
00:22:06,240 --> 00:22:07,360
nowhere so

690
00:22:07,360 --> 00:22:10,719
how are we gonna make the special

691
00:22:11,120 --> 00:22:14,000
that's a really heavy question yeah we

692
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:15,360
haven't had any uh

693
00:22:15,360 --> 00:22:17,440
we haven't had any special special

694
00:22:17,440 --> 00:22:18,640
occasions that have come up

695
00:22:18,640 --> 00:22:20,400
yet uh there's probably a couple there's

696
00:22:20,400 --> 00:22:21,520
a couple coming up in the next few

697
00:22:21,520 --> 00:22:22,320
months

698
00:22:22,320 --> 00:22:24,880
um and i think the basement is going to

699
00:22:24,880 --> 00:22:26,320
get a lot of usage

700
00:22:26,320 --> 00:22:29,280
uh once the kids go to bed on any on a

701
00:22:29,280 --> 00:22:29,919
given night

702
00:22:29,919 --> 00:22:32,400
um hanging out down there maybe playing

703
00:22:32,400 --> 00:22:34,080
some video games maybe

704
00:22:34,080 --> 00:22:37,520
movie um stuff like that um usually if

705
00:22:37,520 --> 00:22:38,480
we have like

706
00:22:38,480 --> 00:22:40,799
some quiet moments before both of us

707
00:22:40,799 --> 00:22:42,640
start falling

708
00:22:42,640 --> 00:22:46,080
pretty good it's going to be a lot more

709
00:22:46,080 --> 00:22:48,480
purposeful effort to try and make sure

710
00:22:48,480 --> 00:22:50,559
that we we save enough of the energy

711
00:22:50,559 --> 00:22:52,720
from during the day for each other

712
00:22:52,720 --> 00:22:54,240
because that's always that's always

713
00:22:54,240 --> 00:22:55,200
difficult

714
00:22:55,200 --> 00:22:58,400
right yeah i think for us it's

715
00:22:58,400 --> 00:23:01,360
um you know kind of remembering to to

716
00:23:01,360 --> 00:23:02,720
take time each

717
00:23:02,720 --> 00:23:05,679
each evening sort of after the the kids

718
00:23:05,679 --> 00:23:07,600
are asleep to um

719
00:23:07,600 --> 00:23:10,159
you know just be together and to you

720
00:23:10,159 --> 00:23:11,600
know ask each other

721
00:23:11,600 --> 00:23:14,799
where we're at mentally and check in

722
00:23:14,799 --> 00:23:16,480
but in turn we also are trying to do

723
00:23:16,480 --> 00:23:18,080
some fun stuff you know we

724
00:23:18,080 --> 00:23:19,360
we decided recently we're going to

725
00:23:19,360 --> 00:23:22,480
re-watch every episode of uh star trek

726
00:23:22,480 --> 00:23:23,200
next gen

727
00:23:23,200 --> 00:23:26,640
right so we've got like like it's like a

728
00:23:26,640 --> 00:23:28,000
it's like a task

729
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:30,080
but you know occasionally we'll be like

730
00:23:30,080 --> 00:23:31,360
oh hey you want to throw in an episode

731
00:23:31,360 --> 00:23:32,400
and it like feels like a

732
00:23:32,400 --> 00:23:35,360
you know a fun treat even though it's

733
00:23:35,360 --> 00:23:36,640
nonsense right

734
00:23:36,640 --> 00:23:40,240
um and then you know we're trying to

735
00:23:40,240 --> 00:23:43,039
to also just sort of have um just some

736
00:23:43,039 --> 00:23:44,640
little moments like we try to turn

737
00:23:44,640 --> 00:23:46,159
things into a date right

738
00:23:46,159 --> 00:23:48,720
um you know my my spouse shaved this

739
00:23:48,720 --> 00:23:50,559
morning and was like hey i shaved my

740
00:23:50,559 --> 00:23:51,360
beard like

741
00:23:51,360 --> 00:23:53,840
i'm silky smooth and so we're like oh

742
00:23:53,840 --> 00:23:55,919
it's like a date you know you just gotta

743
00:23:55,919 --> 00:23:59,039
you just gotta make it up yeah yeah

744
00:23:59,039 --> 00:24:00,080
totally

745
00:24:00,080 --> 00:24:01,520
i just started star trek the original

746
00:24:01,520 --> 00:24:04,640
series today so that's funny um

747
00:24:04,640 --> 00:24:06,240
yeah you know we're we're you know

748
00:24:06,240 --> 00:24:07,440
trying to do the same thing trying to

749
00:24:07,440 --> 00:24:07,840
make

750
00:24:07,840 --> 00:24:10,880
uh special things so like we'll we'll

751
00:24:10,880 --> 00:24:12,480
order some wine have it delivered and

752
00:24:12,480 --> 00:24:14,000
we'll do like a board game night

753
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:15,919
and uh just you know two player game or

754
00:24:15,919 --> 00:24:17,520
something have some music playing and

755
00:24:17,520 --> 00:24:18,159
then

756
00:24:18,159 --> 00:24:19,919
fall asleep to john oliver or something

757
00:24:19,919 --> 00:24:22,000
like that right uh but you know just

758
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:23,360
some little things or we won't have

759
00:24:23,360 --> 00:24:25,279
dinner we'll we'll you know like

760
00:24:25,279 --> 00:24:27,039
uh when we go grocery shopping we'll get

761
00:24:27,039 --> 00:24:28,720
like a charcuterie board or something

762
00:24:28,720 --> 00:24:30,320
like oh we're having fancy wine and

763
00:24:30,320 --> 00:24:32,000
cheese and then we'll

764
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:33,440
fall asleep on the couch and complain

765
00:24:33,440 --> 00:24:35,679
that our back hurts um

766
00:24:35,679 --> 00:24:38,960
but you know that's that's real talk

767
00:24:38,960 --> 00:24:40,559
um so what are some of the things you

768
00:24:40,559 --> 00:24:42,400
guys really miss like if there was one

769
00:24:42,400 --> 00:24:43,600
thing that you really missed so

770
00:24:43,600 --> 00:24:44,960
i think the thing that this time has

771
00:24:44,960 --> 00:24:46,480
given me an opportunity to sort of

772
00:24:46,480 --> 00:24:47,600
reflect on is like

773
00:24:47,600 --> 00:24:49,760
all the little things that now that i'm

774
00:24:49,760 --> 00:24:51,279
deprived of them how much i miss them

775
00:24:51,279 --> 00:24:52,720
and one of them

776
00:24:52,720 --> 00:24:55,520
is that commute time right like as much

777
00:24:55,520 --> 00:24:57,120
as i used to complain about like ah and

778
00:24:57,120 --> 00:24:58,240
then i gotta do this and i got

779
00:24:58,240 --> 00:25:00,799
i really miss like getting up leaving

780
00:25:00,799 --> 00:25:02,880
getting on the train and having that 25

781
00:25:02,880 --> 00:25:04,400
or 30 minutes to myself

782
00:25:04,400 --> 00:25:05,760
i've noticed that i'm not reading as

783
00:25:05,760 --> 00:25:07,840
much as i used to um because that's

784
00:25:07,840 --> 00:25:09,440
predominantly where i did most of my

785
00:25:09,440 --> 00:25:10,000
reading

786
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:12,080
so now i've been trying to simulate my

787
00:25:12,080 --> 00:25:13,200
commute where

788
00:25:13,200 --> 00:25:15,600
i'll try to be out the door by eight

789
00:25:15,600 --> 00:25:17,279
o'clock and i'll come into the office

790
00:25:17,279 --> 00:25:19,200
and i'll just read for 30 minutes and

791
00:25:19,200 --> 00:25:19,760
then

792
00:25:19,760 --> 00:25:21,360
after that i'll turn around and log into

793
00:25:21,360 --> 00:25:22,720
work and say all right guys i'm here

794
00:25:22,720 --> 00:25:23,679
let's let's get

795
00:25:23,679 --> 00:25:26,559
let's get it started um but you know

796
00:25:26,559 --> 00:25:28,480
that that sort of like decompression and

797
00:25:28,480 --> 00:25:29,760
transition time

798
00:25:29,760 --> 00:25:31,840
um i didn't realize how important it was

799
00:25:31,840 --> 00:25:33,120
to me and now i'm realizing

800
00:25:33,120 --> 00:25:35,440
even more so now because i don't have

801
00:25:35,440 --> 00:25:37,360
any transition time whatsoever

802
00:25:37,360 --> 00:25:39,679
um but uh for you guys what are you guys

803
00:25:39,679 --> 00:25:41,760
sort of missing

804
00:25:41,760 --> 00:25:45,360
in this whole thing man that that's real

805
00:25:45,360 --> 00:25:47,440
i realized i don't have any of those

806
00:25:47,440 --> 00:25:49,279
podcasts i used to listen to or any of

807
00:25:49,279 --> 00:25:50,559
those things that uh

808
00:25:50,559 --> 00:25:52,640
that came up in the in the commute time

809
00:25:52,640 --> 00:25:53,679
but uh

810
00:25:53,679 --> 00:25:57,600
yeah for me i think it's mostly um

811
00:25:57,600 --> 00:26:00,799
you know just um my family you know my

812
00:26:00,799 --> 00:26:02,720
extended family we

813
00:26:02,720 --> 00:26:05,840
we purposely live pretty close to uh

814
00:26:05,840 --> 00:26:08,000
my parents then my in-laws and my

815
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:10,320
brother and his family um and with a

816
00:26:10,320 --> 00:26:12,880
two-year-old it's really not the same to

817
00:26:12,880 --> 00:26:14,640
to zoom with them like she's she's

818
00:26:14,640 --> 00:26:16,159
really missing

819
00:26:16,159 --> 00:26:19,200
chasing her cousins around and um

820
00:26:19,200 --> 00:26:22,799
and those things but um you know yes i

821
00:26:22,799 --> 00:26:24,720
think for me it's it's uh

822
00:26:24,720 --> 00:26:28,240
the the actual physical

823
00:26:28,240 --> 00:26:30,240
closeness to other people is the thing i

824
00:26:30,240 --> 00:26:31,840
miss the most

825
00:26:31,840 --> 00:26:34,960
um but uh but i think that that

826
00:26:34,960 --> 00:26:36,840
transition time is probably a close

827
00:26:36,840 --> 00:26:39,360
second

828
00:26:39,360 --> 00:26:42,000
i did recently take up uh crocheting

829
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:44,000
which i hadn't done in years actually

830
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:45,600
i finished the blanket that i started

831
00:26:45,600 --> 00:26:46,400
when i was pregnant with the

832
00:26:46,400 --> 00:26:47,840
two-year-old so

833
00:26:47,840 --> 00:26:49,679
it had been so to say how long it had

834
00:26:49,679 --> 00:26:51,360
been

835
00:26:51,360 --> 00:26:53,520
so um that's been something i've been

836
00:26:53,520 --> 00:26:55,760
trying to to make time for to at least

837
00:26:55,760 --> 00:26:56,880
have some

838
00:26:56,880 --> 00:27:00,559
something i'm i'm doing yeah i don't i

839
00:27:00,559 --> 00:27:00,880
don't

840
00:27:00,880 --> 00:27:02,559
think i missed the commute quite as much

841
00:27:02,559 --> 00:27:03,840
because we were i was doing a lot of

842
00:27:03,840 --> 00:27:04,480
driving

843
00:27:04,480 --> 00:27:07,279
um just because of having to drop the

844
00:27:07,279 --> 00:27:08,960
kids off but i do miss

845
00:27:08,960 --> 00:27:12,720
like having that really firm schedule um

846
00:27:12,720 --> 00:27:15,279
because you know i knew that i we had to

847
00:27:15,279 --> 00:27:17,039
be out the house with the kids by like 7

848
00:27:17,039 --> 00:27:17,840
45

849
00:27:17,840 --> 00:27:20,000
to get them to school on time i knew i

850
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:21,600
was going to get into work at about 8

851
00:27:21,600 --> 00:27:22,480
30.

852
00:27:22,480 --> 00:27:24,640
um i knew that i'd have to leave work

853
00:27:24,640 --> 00:27:25,520
right at five

854
00:27:25,520 --> 00:27:27,919
to go pick them up because nobody wants

855
00:27:27,919 --> 00:27:29,840
to have their kids be the last kids

856
00:27:29,840 --> 00:27:32,640
waiting to get picked up at school um

857
00:27:32,640 --> 00:27:34,480
and then getting home

858
00:27:34,480 --> 00:27:36,559
eating dinner getting them to bed and

859
00:27:36,559 --> 00:27:37,600
knowing like

860
00:27:37,600 --> 00:27:40,559
i i do miss i do miss having that a

861
00:27:40,559 --> 00:27:41,679
little bit more set

862
00:27:41,679 --> 00:27:44,720
um you know as time has gone on i think

863
00:27:44,720 --> 00:27:46,960
it's kind of just been like waking up

864
00:27:46,960 --> 00:27:48,480
closer to whenever

865
00:27:48,480 --> 00:27:50,480
um getting them downstairs and fed

866
00:27:50,480 --> 00:27:51,679
closer to

867
00:27:51,679 --> 00:27:53,600
you know a little bit closer to eight

868
00:27:53,600 --> 00:27:55,279
o'clock or 8 30

869
00:27:55,279 --> 00:27:56,880
and like that time just keeps slipping

870
00:27:56,880 --> 00:27:58,799
and getting them to bed later and then

871
00:27:58,799 --> 00:28:00,559
you know when that happens we don't have

872
00:28:00,559 --> 00:28:02,559
as much time to talk with each other

873
00:28:02,559 --> 00:28:03,279
before

874
00:28:03,279 --> 00:28:06,480
we start getting tired and um

875
00:28:06,480 --> 00:28:08,640
so i do miss having something a little

876
00:28:08,640 --> 00:28:09,679
bit more

877
00:28:09,679 --> 00:28:12,399
a little bit more like clean cut when

878
00:28:12,399 --> 00:28:13,760
when things are happening during the day

879
00:28:13,760 --> 00:28:14,159
and

880
00:28:14,159 --> 00:28:16,000
even on the weekends because we had a we

881
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:17,600
had a lot of activities that we took

882
00:28:17,600 --> 00:28:18,480
them to

883
00:28:18,480 --> 00:28:21,200
um that we were used to doing and we we

884
00:28:21,200 --> 00:28:22,080
kind of liked

885
00:28:22,080 --> 00:28:24,640
um and you know the kids obviously liked

886
00:28:24,640 --> 00:28:25,360
them too

887
00:28:25,360 --> 00:28:27,679
uh so i definitely missed that uh i miss

888
00:28:27,679 --> 00:28:28,559
getting a hangout

889
00:28:28,559 --> 00:28:30,640
uh with my friends at least you know

890
00:28:30,640 --> 00:28:32,240
it's not something that you get to do

891
00:28:32,240 --> 00:28:34,480
a ton but you know on a monthly basis at

892
00:28:34,480 --> 00:28:36,240
least getting together and being able to

893
00:28:36,240 --> 00:28:37,279
see people

894
00:28:37,279 --> 00:28:39,600
uh and it hasn't happened yet but once

895
00:28:39,600 --> 00:28:41,279
it starts getting warm i'm really gonna

896
00:28:41,279 --> 00:28:44,399
miss being able to like walk around

897
00:28:44,399 --> 00:28:47,440
just walk around and uh

898
00:28:47,440 --> 00:28:49,679
you know kind of get on a hop on a hop

899
00:28:49,679 --> 00:28:51,279
on a divi bike and

900
00:28:51,279 --> 00:28:54,000
and ride somewhere uh ride to work or or

901
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:55,039
whatever i can

902
00:28:55,039 --> 00:28:57,600
um definitely gonna miss that stuff all

903
00:28:57,600 --> 00:28:59,120
right well we're out of time i want to

904
00:28:59,120 --> 00:29:00,559
leave it on uh uh

905
00:29:00,559 --> 00:29:02,640
two two positive notes really quick one

906
00:29:02,640 --> 00:29:04,399
there was a comment in the channel about

907
00:29:04,399 --> 00:29:07,760
uh people experiencing uh you know

908
00:29:07,760 --> 00:29:09,520
the positivity of their relationships

909
00:29:09,520 --> 00:29:10,880
right spending this much time with your

910
00:29:10,880 --> 00:29:12,720
partners and realizing like you know wow

911
00:29:12,720 --> 00:29:14,720
we're a great team we can do this

912
00:29:14,720 --> 00:29:16,799
uh so you know that's that's been really

913
00:29:16,799 --> 00:29:18,159
rewarding um

914
00:29:18,159 --> 00:29:20,399
and then uh the second one since the

915
00:29:20,399 --> 00:29:22,240
panel is predominantly is all chicago

916
00:29:22,240 --> 00:29:23,200
representation

917
00:29:23,200 --> 00:29:24,320
how do you deal with the fact that when

918
00:29:24,320 --> 00:29:25,840
you get your italian beef sandwich

919
00:29:25,840 --> 00:29:27,360
delivered if you ordered it dipped it's

920
00:29:27,360 --> 00:29:28,559
way too soggy

921
00:29:28,559 --> 00:29:30,159
like i just can't even get it dipped

922
00:29:30,159 --> 00:29:31,360
anymore i'm just like yo can i get the

923
00:29:31,360 --> 00:29:33,600
sauce on the side

924
00:29:33,600 --> 00:29:36,720
we got beef last night we got a beef

925
00:29:36,720 --> 00:29:38,880
last night and we both specifically

926
00:29:38,880 --> 00:29:40,320
didn't order it dipped

927
00:29:40,320 --> 00:29:41,600
so that it would come the right amount

928
00:29:41,600 --> 00:29:43,760
of soggy we we figured it out

929
00:29:43,760 --> 00:29:46,559
all right cool i can't understand why

930
00:29:46,559 --> 00:29:48,240
anybody would order it

931
00:29:48,240 --> 00:29:51,360
oh you're wrong i mean right now

932
00:29:51,360 --> 00:29:52,559
you just can't get it delivered like

933
00:29:52,559 --> 00:29:54,799
that right the the

934
00:29:54,799 --> 00:29:58,320
the shelf life on that is pretty short

935
00:29:58,320 --> 00:30:00,000
all right all right erin team it's been

936
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:01,679
great chatting with you guys thanks

937
