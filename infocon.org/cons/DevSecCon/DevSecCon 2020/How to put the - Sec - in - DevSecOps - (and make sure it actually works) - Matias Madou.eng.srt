1
00:00:00,060 --> 00:00:01,800
I am gonna sneak out of here and I'm

2
00:00:01,800 --> 00:00:04,100
gonna turn it over to you

3
00:00:04,100 --> 00:00:10,428
sounds good I'll quickly share my screen

4
00:00:10,969 --> 00:00:15,660
can you see my presentation did I go

5
00:00:15,660 --> 00:00:18,300
well yep we got you're good to go

6
00:00:18,300 --> 00:00:20,279
perfect thank you very much really

7
00:00:20,279 --> 00:00:22,020
appreciated thank you thanks for having

8
00:00:22,020 --> 00:00:26,840
me in this in this presentation webcast

9
00:00:26,840 --> 00:00:29,279
so thank you very much I'm Matthias

10
00:00:29,279 --> 00:00:32,610
Madhu and for the next 20 25 minutes I

11
00:00:32,610 --> 00:00:34,920
would like to talk about how to put the

12
00:00:34,920 --> 00:00:37,500
security and DevOps and make it actually

13
00:00:37,500 --> 00:00:40,950
work my background I'm the CTO and

14
00:00:40,950 --> 00:00:42,840
co-founder of secure code warrior I

15
00:00:42,840 --> 00:00:44,940
actually started my career back in

16
00:00:44,940 --> 00:00:47,370
Belgium at Ghent University pursuing a

17
00:00:47,370 --> 00:00:50,280
PhD in application security I was

18
00:00:50,280 --> 00:00:52,199
working on static analysis solutions

19
00:00:52,199 --> 00:00:54,809
trying to obfuscate stuff and with my

20
00:00:54,809 --> 00:00:56,670
PhD I actually moved to a company called

21
00:00:56,670 --> 00:00:59,100
fortify and what they were doing they

22
00:00:59,100 --> 00:01:01,289
were trying to find problems in code the

23
00:01:01,289 --> 00:01:02,640
sequin Jackson's the cross-site

24
00:01:02,640 --> 00:01:04,290
scripting and I think they were actually

25
00:01:04,290 --> 00:01:06,030
doing really good trying to find these

26
00:01:06,030 --> 00:01:09,960
problems in code although at the end of

27
00:01:09,960 --> 00:01:11,369
the seven years that are spent at

28
00:01:11,369 --> 00:01:13,409
fortify I realized that it is actually

29
00:01:13,409 --> 00:01:16,290
very easy to find problems in codes if

30
00:01:16,290 --> 00:01:18,360
you never tell a developer how to code

31
00:01:18,360 --> 00:01:21,240
securely so with that knowledge we

32
00:01:21,240 --> 00:01:23,610
actually started this we started secure

33
00:01:23,610 --> 00:01:25,470
code warrior and you wanted to make sure

34
00:01:25,470 --> 00:01:27,810
that we can actually bring that

35
00:01:27,810 --> 00:01:29,579
knowledge to the developer and make sure

36
00:01:29,579 --> 00:01:32,369
that he can Scout securely so what I

37
00:01:32,369 --> 00:01:34,590
would like to talk about today is on two

38
00:01:34,590 --> 00:01:37,979
things I would like to look back in the

39
00:01:37,979 --> 00:01:40,020
past and I would like to look at the

40
00:01:40,020 --> 00:01:42,119
impossibility of writing secure code why

41
00:01:42,119 --> 00:01:44,100
are we still talking about writing

42
00:01:44,100 --> 00:01:45,990
secure code isn't that problem sold

43
00:01:45,990 --> 00:01:47,790
already and then I would like to do a

44
00:01:47,790 --> 00:01:50,340
forward-looking thing on how to create

45
00:01:50,340 --> 00:01:52,770
secure code and and how to mingle that

46
00:01:52,770 --> 00:01:54,990
into the new way of working into DevOps

47
00:01:54,990 --> 00:01:57,149
and I would like to focus on culture

48
00:01:57,149 --> 00:02:00,869
automation measurement and sharing so

49
00:02:00,869 --> 00:02:02,850
going back in the past on the

50
00:02:02,850 --> 00:02:04,680
impossibility of writing secure codes

51
00:02:04,680 --> 00:02:06,869
when I was creating these flights I was

52
00:02:06,869 --> 00:02:08,399
trying to figure out like hey what is

53
00:02:08,399 --> 00:02:10,739
the most expensive failure that ever

54
00:02:10,739 --> 00:02:11,610
happened

55
00:02:11,610 --> 00:02:14,610
came back to the Ariana five rocket were

56
00:02:14,610 --> 00:02:17,940
less than a minute in the launch they

57
00:02:17,940 --> 00:02:20,840
had to self detonate the rocket because

58
00:02:20,840 --> 00:02:24,090
they actually tried to cram a 64 bit

59
00:02:24,090 --> 00:02:27,390
float into a 16-bit integer and that was

60
00:02:27,390 --> 00:02:29,130
for velocity and actually that didn't

61
00:02:29,130 --> 00:02:31,530
work for very well it caused an overflow

62
00:02:31,530 --> 00:02:33,930
and for performance reasons they

63
00:02:33,930 --> 00:02:35,490
actually suppressed the error handling

64
00:02:35,490 --> 00:02:38,520
so instead of going up the rocket was

65
00:02:38,520 --> 00:02:40,440
suddenly trying to go down that didn't

66
00:02:40,440 --> 00:02:42,300
really work well so they they self that

67
00:02:42,300 --> 00:02:45,630
mated the rocket with that seven billion

68
00:02:45,630 --> 00:02:47,940
was lost ten years of research was lost

69
00:02:47,940 --> 00:02:51,810
so a huge huge loss imagine being a

70
00:02:51,810 --> 00:02:54,900
developer that has has written this very

71
00:02:54,900 --> 00:02:57,660
nice piece of code that led to this

72
00:02:57,660 --> 00:03:00,989
particular loss well NASA learned it's

73
00:03:00,989 --> 00:03:02,640
lesson from this particular piece of

74
00:03:02,640 --> 00:03:06,090
code and because what they've done after

75
00:03:06,090 --> 00:03:08,459
the Ariane 5 rocket is they try to make

76
00:03:08,459 --> 00:03:11,040
sure that mistakes like these would not

77
00:03:11,040 --> 00:03:13,080
happen and what they essentially done

78
00:03:13,080 --> 00:03:15,239
they install the process and yes it's

79
00:03:15,239 --> 00:03:17,549
very costly and they install a process

80
00:03:17,549 --> 00:03:20,250
where every line of code within NASA is

81
00:03:20,250 --> 00:03:22,769
saying she now costs almost a two

82
00:03:22,769 --> 00:03:25,080
thousand one cost a thousand dollars to

83
00:03:25,080 --> 00:03:27,840
get that into production into a rocket

84
00:03:27,840 --> 00:03:30,540
and at that same time the average cost

85
00:03:30,540 --> 00:03:33,840
of a line of code was 50 bucks so so

86
00:03:33,840 --> 00:03:36,660
they figured out like hey it is better

87
00:03:36,660 --> 00:03:39,840
to invest in in producing secure code in

88
00:03:39,840 --> 00:03:42,600
producing code that works that will

89
00:03:42,600 --> 00:03:46,470
prevent huge losses in the future and

90
00:03:46,470 --> 00:03:48,390
and so they they made they had their

91
00:03:48,390 --> 00:03:53,690
lessons learned or as bob ross would say

92
00:03:55,340 --> 00:03:57,930
paint you'll see all kind of things

93
00:03:57,930 --> 00:03:59,820
happening on your canvas and very soon

94
00:03:59,820 --> 00:04:01,019
you've learned to use all these

95
00:04:01,019 --> 00:04:03,590
beautiful little things that happened i

96
00:04:03,590 --> 00:04:05,700
think in one of their earlier shows i

97
00:04:05,700 --> 00:04:08,430
mentioned we don't we don't make

98
00:04:08,430 --> 00:04:12,420
mistakes we have happy accidents well i

99
00:04:12,420 --> 00:04:14,310
don't think it was a happy accident for

100
00:04:14,310 --> 00:04:16,709
the ariana 5 rocket but sometimes there

101
00:04:16,709 --> 00:04:18,899
are actually happy accidents on street

102
00:04:18,899 --> 00:04:20,820
fighter ii for example it would not be

103
00:04:20,820 --> 00:04:23,700
that popular if it wasn't for the combo

104
00:04:23,700 --> 00:04:25,800
and the combo was actually a glitch so

105
00:04:25,800 --> 00:04:27,540
when they were developing the game and

106
00:04:27,540 --> 00:04:30,030
they figured out in a certain level that

107
00:04:30,030 --> 00:04:32,880
two punches were counted as one and that

108
00:04:32,880 --> 00:04:35,610
eventually became the combo so this this

109
00:04:35,610 --> 00:04:38,010
nice this this glitch actually became a

110
00:04:38,010 --> 00:04:41,010
nice little feature into Street Fighter

111
00:04:41,010 --> 00:04:43,800
2 another very interesting feature that

112
00:04:43,800 --> 00:04:46,380
we see quite often in our applications

113
00:04:46,380 --> 00:04:49,410
these days are sequel injection the

114
00:04:49,410 --> 00:04:51,570
feature it's of course another feature

115
00:04:51,570 --> 00:04:54,720
it is a massive problem where the

116
00:04:54,720 --> 00:04:56,880
outsider can essentially change the data

117
00:04:56,880 --> 00:04:58,770
in the database it can update the data

118
00:04:58,770 --> 00:05:01,050
in the database it can remove data in

119
00:05:01,050 --> 00:05:02,670
the database or we can read the data in

120
00:05:02,670 --> 00:05:05,580
the database but outside of its own

121
00:05:05,580 --> 00:05:07,680
control it's doing more than what it is

122
00:05:07,680 --> 00:05:12,060
allowed to do so this is still a problem

123
00:05:12,060 --> 00:05:13,740
and you would think like hey is this is

124
00:05:13,740 --> 00:05:16,230
this something new is this is this the

125
00:05:16,230 --> 00:05:18,750
new and hot problem in software security

126
00:05:18,750 --> 00:05:20,910
well unfortunately is not because when

127
00:05:20,910 --> 00:05:23,640
we were actually decorating our secure

128
00:05:23,640 --> 00:05:25,770
code warrior office here in Bruges I

129
00:05:25,770 --> 00:05:30,000
found this very nice and signed xkcd and

130
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:32,760
that was given by my manager ten years

131
00:05:32,760 --> 00:05:35,010
ago because at the back and even more 12

132
00:05:35,010 --> 00:05:36,960
years know by now at the back it

133
00:05:36,960 --> 00:05:38,700
actually says Merry Christmas and it was

134
00:05:38,700 --> 00:05:41,520
signed by my manager at the time so and

135
00:05:41,520 --> 00:05:43,860
even then we were already like talking

136
00:05:43,860 --> 00:05:45,300
about sequel injection and it was

137
00:05:45,300 --> 00:05:47,460
already ten years old by the time this

138
00:05:47,460 --> 00:05:50,880
xkcd came came to life and so we're

139
00:05:50,880 --> 00:05:53,280
still talking about the problem which is

140
00:05:53,280 --> 00:05:55,650
20 plus years old and we're still you

141
00:05:55,650 --> 00:05:59,010
know not able to get this right is it

142
00:05:59,010 --> 00:06:00,900
still a problem well let's let's have a

143
00:06:00,900 --> 00:06:04,470
look at some data and a really good

144
00:06:04,470 --> 00:06:06,630
quote that I like all office by Jim

145
00:06:06,630 --> 00:06:09,330
Barksdale former CEO of Netscape he you

146
00:06:09,330 --> 00:06:11,340
once said like if we have data let's

147
00:06:11,340 --> 00:06:12,960
look at the data if you all have our

148
00:06:12,960 --> 00:06:15,060
opinions let's go with mine so luckily

149
00:06:15,060 --> 00:06:17,040
today we have some data to look at so

150
00:06:17,040 --> 00:06:19,140
that I don't have to broadcast my

151
00:06:19,140 --> 00:06:21,660
opinion here and one and three newly

152
00:06:21,660 --> 00:06:24,180
scan applications still contain sequin

153
00:06:24,180 --> 00:06:26,280
Jackson in the last five years the joke

154
00:06:26,280 --> 00:06:28,020
goes that two out of three do not have a

155
00:06:28,020 --> 00:06:32,250
database 111 billion lines of code are

156
00:06:32,250 --> 00:06:35,670
written every year we all have a

157
00:06:35,670 --> 00:06:37,770
software developer in

158
00:06:37,770 --> 00:06:39,750
there's nobody the software deleter in

159
00:06:39,750 --> 00:06:42,420
your organization there's nobody that

160
00:06:42,420 --> 00:06:44,760
goes around and it's sole job is to

161
00:06:44,760 --> 00:06:48,510
remove codes well that's that's the

162
00:06:48,510 --> 00:06:50,310
thing we're still producing new code

163
00:06:50,310 --> 00:06:52,230
day by day we only want to have more

164
00:06:52,230 --> 00:06:55,230
features and better things nicer things

165
00:06:55,230 --> 00:06:57,060
so we're all we only producing more

166
00:06:57,060 --> 00:07:01,410
codes it's 30 more more 30 times more

167
00:07:01,410 --> 00:07:03,090
expensive to fix

168
00:07:03,090 --> 00:07:05,700
vulnerability late in the cycle then all

169
00:07:05,700 --> 00:07:07,080
the way at the beginning it's it's

170
00:07:07,080 --> 00:07:08,580
obvious because if you fix it late you

171
00:07:08,580 --> 00:07:09,900
know you have to go through all these

172
00:07:09,900 --> 00:07:12,630
additional cycles any average cost of a

173
00:07:12,630 --> 00:07:14,780
breach almost 4,000,000

174
00:07:14,780 --> 00:07:19,100
so what is the problem how do we tackle

175
00:07:19,100 --> 00:07:22,350
software security today and and why are

176
00:07:22,350 --> 00:07:25,050
we still not able to get rid of that

177
00:07:25,050 --> 00:07:27,600
particular problem so this is how we

178
00:07:27,600 --> 00:07:29,910
tackle like for example sequel injection

179
00:07:29,910 --> 00:07:33,930
today if you concatenate some parameters

180
00:07:33,930 --> 00:07:36,360
into a query and your pen testers come

181
00:07:36,360 --> 00:07:38,040
back and say hey you know what parameter

182
00:07:38,040 --> 00:07:40,650
1 parameter 2 they are vulnerable to CQ

183
00:07:40,650 --> 00:07:42,480
injection people can actually steal our

184
00:07:42,480 --> 00:07:44,280
database we have to fix it

185
00:07:44,280 --> 00:07:47,280
that immediately well it's gonna happen

186
00:07:47,280 --> 00:07:49,560
immediately you go back you go to your

187
00:07:49,560 --> 00:07:52,470
developers and it's going to be fixed

188
00:07:52,470 --> 00:07:53,760
because you're open you're vulnerable

189
00:07:53,760 --> 00:07:56,760
it's a real real problem if your static

190
00:07:56,760 --> 00:07:58,590
analysis solution comes back with

191
00:07:58,590 --> 00:08:01,410
parameter 3 hypothetically being a

192
00:08:01,410 --> 00:08:04,050
problem because if all the stars align

193
00:08:04,050 --> 00:08:07,800
well then most likely somebody will be

194
00:08:07,800 --> 00:08:10,050
able to exploit this particular problem

195
00:08:10,050 --> 00:08:12,870
well then what actually happens is you

196
00:08:12,870 --> 00:08:15,300
go back to your QA people and to your

197
00:08:15,300 --> 00:08:16,770
developers and you actually start a

198
00:08:16,770 --> 00:08:18,930
fight between QA security and developers

199
00:08:18,930 --> 00:08:21,330
to figure out if this is really a

200
00:08:21,330 --> 00:08:23,010
problem and if it's really a problem

201
00:08:23,010 --> 00:08:26,820
then we may or maynot some man we fix it

202
00:08:26,820 --> 00:08:28,470
if it's not a problem we will not fix it

203
00:08:28,470 --> 00:08:30,600
but first give us some more evidence

204
00:08:30,600 --> 00:08:33,809
give us an attack vector quite often

205
00:08:33,809 --> 00:08:35,820
it's easier to just fix the problem then

206
00:08:35,820 --> 00:08:38,070
and start this whole whole fight and

207
00:08:38,070 --> 00:08:40,890
last but not least if parameter 4 if

208
00:08:40,890 --> 00:08:43,229
none of our tools and none of our white

209
00:08:43,229 --> 00:08:45,180
hat hackers or consulting firms come

210
00:08:45,180 --> 00:08:46,320
back and they say you know what it's

211
00:08:46,320 --> 00:08:48,930
vulnerable well we're not gonna fix it

212
00:08:48,930 --> 00:08:51,120
today you know and this is how you Pro

213
00:08:51,120 --> 00:08:53,760
which applications security or software

214
00:08:53,760 --> 00:08:55,650
security today we do it one by one

215
00:08:55,650 --> 00:08:58,680
little by little very reactive but we're

216
00:08:58,680 --> 00:09:00,810
not taking a holistic approach where we

217
00:09:00,810 --> 00:09:02,610
say hey you know what from today on we

218
00:09:02,610 --> 00:09:04,350
got a code in a secure manner we're

219
00:09:04,350 --> 00:09:06,180
gonna make sure that it is always

220
00:09:06,180 --> 00:09:10,650
correct and let me elaborate a little

221
00:09:10,650 --> 00:09:12,510
bit further on that one if you have an

222
00:09:12,510 --> 00:09:14,880
organization quite often you know about

223
00:09:14,880 --> 00:09:17,250
security issues I've never been to an

224
00:09:17,250 --> 00:09:19,320
organization where there's a birth

225
00:09:19,320 --> 00:09:21,900
tracking Xero system with zero issues in

226
00:09:21,900 --> 00:09:24,180
there so you know about problems in your

227
00:09:24,180 --> 00:09:26,339
code and you're asking a developer to

228
00:09:26,339 --> 00:09:28,500
fix these particular problems quite

229
00:09:28,500 --> 00:09:32,400
often the help is fairly minimal why is

230
00:09:32,400 --> 00:09:35,130
help fairly minimal well you know what

231
00:09:35,130 --> 00:09:38,420
how big is your security team internally

232
00:09:38,420 --> 00:09:41,270
well normally what we see statistic

233
00:09:41,270 --> 00:09:43,350
statistically one in a hundred

234
00:09:43,350 --> 00:09:47,220
developers is responsible for security

235
00:09:47,220 --> 00:09:49,500
so one application security person per

236
00:09:49,500 --> 00:09:52,440
100 developers there are studies that

237
00:09:52,440 --> 00:09:54,180
say hey you know what we're almost at

238
00:09:54,180 --> 00:09:56,700
two different - software security people

239
00:09:56,700 --> 00:09:59,459
per hundred developers but these studies

240
00:09:59,459 --> 00:10:02,220
actually and target companies that

241
00:10:02,220 --> 00:10:04,440
already think about security I'm quite

242
00:10:04,440 --> 00:10:06,420
often there is simply zero for

243
00:10:06,420 --> 00:10:07,800
organizations that do not even think

244
00:10:07,800 --> 00:10:10,250
about security so we might imagine

245
00:10:10,250 --> 00:10:12,600
having to guide a hundred people that's

246
00:10:12,600 --> 00:10:14,640
that's an astronomic amount of people

247
00:10:14,640 --> 00:10:16,500
and think about a hundred people in

248
00:10:16,500 --> 00:10:19,560
around you and you have to guide them

249
00:10:19,560 --> 00:10:23,790
all on a day-by-day xx 24/7 they can be

250
00:10:23,790 --> 00:10:25,800
around the world all day long you have

251
00:10:25,800 --> 00:10:27,450
to guide them 100 developers for every

252
00:10:27,450 --> 00:10:28,890
line of code that they write you are

253
00:10:28,890 --> 00:10:31,320
responsible so it's it's obvious that

254
00:10:31,320 --> 00:10:33,420
these developers do not get enough help

255
00:10:33,420 --> 00:10:39,330
by the security people and also the

256
00:10:39,330 --> 00:10:41,700
developers you know and the security

257
00:10:41,700 --> 00:10:43,800
people quite often they are not really

258
00:10:43,800 --> 00:10:46,860
aligned if you ask that security person

259
00:10:46,860 --> 00:10:47,520
for help

260
00:10:47,520 --> 00:10:49,650
quite often he comes back with a

261
00:10:49,650 --> 00:10:53,430
response or with a suggestion which

262
00:10:53,430 --> 00:10:55,320
doesn't make sense for your code for

263
00:10:55,320 --> 00:10:57,900
your technology for your stack and and

264
00:10:57,900 --> 00:11:00,150
the reason why is quite often that that

265
00:11:00,150 --> 00:11:02,610
application security person is really

266
00:11:02,610 --> 00:11:04,800
focused on finding the problem

267
00:11:04,800 --> 00:11:07,410
and and and showing that the code is

268
00:11:07,410 --> 00:11:09,569
broken quite often that person is not

269
00:11:09,569 --> 00:11:11,850
really you know trying to make sure and

270
00:11:11,850 --> 00:11:13,499
help you in fixing that particular

271
00:11:13,499 --> 00:11:15,779
problem showing that it is broken is is

272
00:11:15,779 --> 00:11:17,869
quite often more than enough

273
00:11:17,869 --> 00:11:20,999
in addition fixing issues we all know

274
00:11:20,999 --> 00:11:22,769
it's causing a ton of overhead you have

275
00:11:22,769 --> 00:11:25,679
to find the problem in the code you have

276
00:11:25,679 --> 00:11:26,910
to find the solution you have to

277
00:11:26,910 --> 00:11:28,290
research the solution you have to

278
00:11:28,290 --> 00:11:30,119
implement it you have to test it you

279
00:11:30,119 --> 00:11:32,279
have to QA it and so on and so forth so

280
00:11:32,279 --> 00:11:34,499
every fix in your code takes a ton of

281
00:11:34,499 --> 00:11:37,259
overhead so what happened quite often in

282
00:11:37,259 --> 00:11:38,910
our organisations is hey you know what

283
00:11:38,910 --> 00:11:41,249
we make a rank and we fix a couple of

284
00:11:41,249 --> 00:11:43,619
issues but the left the others are still

285
00:11:43,619 --> 00:11:47,309
there as I've just mentioned we keep on

286
00:11:47,309 --> 00:11:50,670
writing codes 111 billion lines of code

287
00:11:50,670 --> 00:11:53,220
every year there are solutions there are

288
00:11:53,220 --> 00:11:55,559
security solutions that find 700

289
00:11:55,559 --> 00:11:57,329
different category of problems so it's

290
00:11:57,329 --> 00:12:00,389
almost impossible for a developer to to

291
00:12:00,389 --> 00:12:03,259
not introduce problems into the code and

292
00:12:03,259 --> 00:12:06,029
last but not least there are even more

293
00:12:06,029 --> 00:12:08,399
problems in code that nobody is aware of

294
00:12:08,399 --> 00:12:11,730
that we can't find that or or white hat

295
00:12:11,730 --> 00:12:14,549
hackers or penetration testers or tools

296
00:12:14,549 --> 00:12:17,970
are not finding because quite often it's

297
00:12:17,970 --> 00:12:21,299
it's the analysis is incomplete so this

298
00:12:21,299 --> 00:12:23,610
actually leads to a never ending story

299
00:12:23,610 --> 00:12:26,220
the way we fix our problems and the way

300
00:12:26,220 --> 00:12:29,309
we operate today leads us to this this

301
00:12:29,309 --> 00:12:32,970
endless never you know we have to break

302
00:12:32,970 --> 00:12:35,009
that cycle somehow we have to get out of

303
00:12:35,009 --> 00:12:36,959
it we have to recognize our problems we

304
00:12:36,959 --> 00:12:38,970
have to figure out hey what are the key

305
00:12:38,970 --> 00:12:40,829
problems in here and we have to try and

306
00:12:40,829 --> 00:12:45,119
address them so how can we create secure

307
00:12:45,119 --> 00:12:48,929
code today so first of all what we can

308
00:12:48,929 --> 00:12:51,889
do is we can ask our developers to type

309
00:12:51,889 --> 00:12:55,379
harder faster but that is not what we

310
00:12:55,379 --> 00:12:58,799
want to do our developers are already

311
00:12:58,799 --> 00:13:01,319
under a lot of stress and they already

312
00:13:01,319 --> 00:13:03,149
work day and night to get the features

313
00:13:03,149 --> 00:13:06,029
out we have to work smarter we have to

314
00:13:06,029 --> 00:13:08,839
address the problems that I just

315
00:13:08,839 --> 00:13:11,790
recognized in how we did things in the

316
00:13:11,790 --> 00:13:15,779
old days so there's an evolution from

317
00:13:15,779 --> 00:13:18,120
from waterfall to agile and DevOps

318
00:13:18,120 --> 00:13:21,450
and how can we make sure that our

319
00:13:21,450 --> 00:13:24,150
security solutions that the way we

320
00:13:24,150 --> 00:13:26,400
approach security also fits this new

321
00:13:26,400 --> 00:13:28,980
particular trend and by the way we quite

322
00:13:28,980 --> 00:13:30,930
often say hey we're all doing agile and

323
00:13:30,930 --> 00:13:33,260
DevOps and and we're way past waterfall

324
00:13:33,260 --> 00:13:35,310
unfortunately that is not entirely the

325
00:13:35,310 --> 00:13:36,810
truth you know we're still in this

326
00:13:36,810 --> 00:13:39,330
movement to words and new ways of

327
00:13:39,330 --> 00:13:41,160
working to address the problems that we

328
00:13:41,160 --> 00:13:43,920
saw in the past and but we're not quite

329
00:13:43,920 --> 00:13:48,089
there yet so how can we adopt our our

330
00:13:48,089 --> 00:13:50,700
security principles or software security

331
00:13:50,700 --> 00:13:53,160
producing mechanisms to this new way of

332
00:13:53,160 --> 00:13:57,060
world just an example of DevOps there's

333
00:13:57,060 --> 00:13:59,400
plenty of tools over there how can we

334
00:13:59,400 --> 00:14:02,160
embed security in there well I think

335
00:14:02,160 --> 00:14:06,120
there's a real opportunity to overlay

336
00:14:06,120 --> 00:14:09,720
the DevOps cycle with writing secure

337
00:14:09,720 --> 00:14:11,940
code through each of these phases I

338
00:14:11,940 --> 00:14:15,330
think we should be able to give the

339
00:14:15,330 --> 00:14:17,880
right information to give the right

340
00:14:17,880 --> 00:14:20,670
hints to a developer to tell them what

341
00:14:20,670 --> 00:14:24,930
to do during the building the coding and

342
00:14:24,930 --> 00:14:29,779
and and and the releasing of the code in

343
00:14:29,779 --> 00:14:32,480
addition I think we should be able to

344
00:14:32,480 --> 00:14:36,900
get some points into the operation site

345
00:14:36,900 --> 00:14:38,640
so that we get the interesting

346
00:14:38,640 --> 00:14:41,250
information to do better to do better

347
00:14:41,250 --> 00:14:43,830
while we're coding so on a day to day

348
00:14:43,830 --> 00:14:46,770
basis we should be guided in real time

349
00:14:46,770 --> 00:14:50,670
so we should embed more processes in

350
00:14:50,670 --> 00:14:53,160
there so that when we're coding we're

351
00:14:53,160 --> 00:14:55,110
getting the right information and it's

352
00:14:55,110 --> 00:14:56,790
technology-based it's not always a

353
00:14:56,790 --> 00:14:58,740
person it's not that one person four

354
00:14:58,740 --> 00:15:00,779
hundred developers that shortage is

355
00:15:00,779 --> 00:15:03,540
there and that shortage is gonna stay so

356
00:15:03,540 --> 00:15:05,940
what we what we should do is we should

357
00:15:05,940 --> 00:15:08,430
collectively take the knowledge of that

358
00:15:08,430 --> 00:15:10,830
one particular person and make sure that

359
00:15:10,830 --> 00:15:13,080
we embed that throughout our cycle and

360
00:15:13,080 --> 00:15:16,410
that we can in a very efficient way this

361
00:15:16,410 --> 00:15:18,000
review that knowledge to the other

362
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:21,660
developers so let's take one step back

363
00:15:21,660 --> 00:15:23,820
and I was actually looking for the

364
00:15:23,820 --> 00:15:26,339
pillars of success in DevOps and I did a

365
00:15:26,339 --> 00:15:28,740
quick google search and it seems to be

366
00:15:28,740 --> 00:15:30,730
between three and nine

367
00:15:30,730 --> 00:15:32,350
you know that is that seems to be like

368
00:15:32,350 --> 00:15:34,150
the magic there's between three and nine

369
00:15:34,150 --> 00:15:37,480
pillars on how to be successful with

370
00:15:37,480 --> 00:15:40,990
with DevOps so that gave me that gave me

371
00:15:40,990 --> 00:15:43,480
actually the Liberty to just take one to

372
00:15:43,480 --> 00:15:45,850
pick one that I liked and one that I

373
00:15:45,850 --> 00:15:48,760
came across I found very interesting

374
00:15:48,760 --> 00:15:51,700
it started with cams culture automation

375
00:15:51,700 --> 00:15:53,740
measurement and sharing and it evolved

376
00:15:53,740 --> 00:15:57,310
to columns where lean came into the mix

377
00:15:57,310 --> 00:15:59,380
to so culture automation lean

378
00:15:59,380 --> 00:16:02,500
measurement and sharing and I was taking

379
00:16:02,500 --> 00:16:04,270
that one and I was trying to figure out

380
00:16:04,270 --> 00:16:06,790
like hey how can we also put security

381
00:16:06,790 --> 00:16:08,590
into the culture security into

382
00:16:08,590 --> 00:16:10,180
automation how should we approach

383
00:16:10,180 --> 00:16:12,460
security when we measure stuff and how

384
00:16:12,460 --> 00:16:14,860
should we approach security when we're

385
00:16:14,860 --> 00:16:17,590
sharing information and and that's

386
00:16:17,590 --> 00:16:18,910
actually what I will try to do in the

387
00:16:18,910 --> 00:16:21,190
next couple slides I'll try to figure

388
00:16:21,190 --> 00:16:24,640
out how we can in that whole a DevOps

389
00:16:24,640 --> 00:16:27,400
cycle in these for not the five I'll

390
00:16:27,400 --> 00:16:30,370
take the four in in in those four

391
00:16:30,370 --> 00:16:32,230
pillars how can we actually approach

392
00:16:32,230 --> 00:16:35,920
security in them so let's start with

393
00:16:35,920 --> 00:16:41,470
culture culture is is everybody's thing

394
00:16:41,470 --> 00:16:43,330
everybody should be rallying around

395
00:16:43,330 --> 00:16:45,880
culture if you're building a house if

396
00:16:45,880 --> 00:16:47,500
you have a lot of constructors in there

397
00:16:47,500 --> 00:16:50,110
well they should talk to each other and

398
00:16:50,110 --> 00:16:51,790
everybody should rally around like hey

399
00:16:51,790 --> 00:16:53,770
we really want to make this and build

400
00:16:53,770 --> 00:16:56,560
this house and and not fix things

401
00:16:56,560 --> 00:16:58,480
afterwards you know we should be very

402
00:16:58,480 --> 00:17:00,730
proactive and not reactive in building

403
00:17:00,730 --> 00:17:02,740
this house so you should not be the case

404
00:17:02,740 --> 00:17:05,410
if you're all done that you say T we

405
00:17:05,410 --> 00:17:06,910
need electricity and there's no wiring

406
00:17:06,910 --> 00:17:10,119
in there you know so we should all rally

407
00:17:10,119 --> 00:17:12,069
around the same thing and and it should

408
00:17:12,069 --> 00:17:13,810
be throughout everybody in the

409
00:17:13,810 --> 00:17:16,150
organization that you also think about

410
00:17:16,150 --> 00:17:18,880
security okay and if you tickle that

411
00:17:18,880 --> 00:17:21,880
down to developers well I think for

412
00:17:21,880 --> 00:17:24,400
developers it also has to fit their

413
00:17:24,400 --> 00:17:27,099
culture okay so security has to fit

414
00:17:27,099 --> 00:17:29,410
their culture quite often the way

415
00:17:29,410 --> 00:17:32,170
developers want want to do something is

416
00:17:32,170 --> 00:17:34,180
you know what it has to be fun it has to

417
00:17:34,180 --> 00:17:37,510
be online it has to be games gamified

418
00:17:37,510 --> 00:17:39,670
and it has to be tailored through their

419
00:17:39,670 --> 00:17:42,490
technology the way that we have to give

420
00:17:42,490 --> 00:17:44,090
information to develop

421
00:17:44,090 --> 00:17:47,450
has to suit their natural habitat I made

422
00:17:47,450 --> 00:17:50,810
on their day to day basis okay so when

423
00:17:50,810 --> 00:17:52,820
when you're working on tools when you're

424
00:17:52,820 --> 00:17:54,950
trying to give something to developers

425
00:17:54,950 --> 00:17:57,470
you really have to make sure that it

426
00:17:57,470 --> 00:18:00,710
fits what and how developer thinks how a

427
00:18:00,710 --> 00:18:04,460
developer operates what he's using on a

428
00:18:04,460 --> 00:18:06,650
day to day basis that is what we need to

429
00:18:06,650 --> 00:18:09,530
take into consideration when we develop

430
00:18:09,530 --> 00:18:13,340
solutions to help a developer at the

431
00:18:13,340 --> 00:18:15,590
same time the developer should also see

432
00:18:15,590 --> 00:18:19,240
the benefit of of using these solutions

433
00:18:19,240 --> 00:18:23,030
he should understand that when he's

434
00:18:23,030 --> 00:18:26,120
producing secure code when he is really

435
00:18:26,120 --> 00:18:29,180
rallying around secure code well he

436
00:18:29,180 --> 00:18:33,170
actually his value goes up a lot of

437
00:18:33,170 --> 00:18:35,150
people will be interested in people that

438
00:18:35,150 --> 00:18:38,000
can write secure code and what we see in

439
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:40,730
our organization is we see actually a

440
00:18:40,730 --> 00:18:44,300
very strong correlation between a good

441
00:18:44,300 --> 00:18:47,210
developer and a security savvy developer

442
00:18:47,210 --> 00:18:50,000
and I think my own personal reasoning

443
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:52,910
for that one is a security savvy

444
00:18:52,910 --> 00:18:55,100
developer you only become security savvy

445
00:18:55,100 --> 00:18:58,280
if you have the basics right if you want

446
00:18:58,280 --> 00:19:00,080
to learn more if you want to understand

447
00:19:00,080 --> 00:19:02,240
more about something why is something

448
00:19:02,240 --> 00:19:04,550
breaking that's when you move into the

449
00:19:04,550 --> 00:19:07,760
field of software security and building

450
00:19:07,760 --> 00:19:10,760
secure systems so if a developer can

451
00:19:10,760 --> 00:19:12,530
understand that I think he will be more

452
00:19:12,530 --> 00:19:15,290
willing to learn about writing secure

453
00:19:15,290 --> 00:19:18,560
code quite often there's there's a lot

454
00:19:18,560 --> 00:19:20,590
of job opportunities if your

455
00:19:20,590 --> 00:19:23,180
organization really cares about secure

456
00:19:23,180 --> 00:19:25,840
code well it should be obvious that

457
00:19:25,840 --> 00:19:28,700
working on the critical piece of code in

458
00:19:28,700 --> 00:19:31,010
your organization will require certain

459
00:19:31,010 --> 00:19:34,160
skill so and it's quite often the the

460
00:19:34,160 --> 00:19:37,340
most interesting projects so if if

461
00:19:37,340 --> 00:19:39,650
you're rallying around writing secure

462
00:19:39,650 --> 00:19:41,990
code well it will give you opportunity

463
00:19:41,990 --> 00:19:43,880
within your own organization to work on

464
00:19:43,880 --> 00:19:48,890
more interesting systems ultimately I

465
00:19:48,890 --> 00:19:51,980
think it should be clear for a developer

466
00:19:51,980 --> 00:19:55,040
that writing secure code is the only way

467
00:19:55,040 --> 00:19:55,980
we should do it

468
00:19:55,980 --> 00:19:59,010
organization I really hope you're in an

469
00:19:59,010 --> 00:20:02,179
organization where you the the the top

470
00:20:02,179 --> 00:20:04,650
management cares about writing secure

471
00:20:04,650 --> 00:20:06,179
code and everybody is rallying around

472
00:20:06,179 --> 00:20:08,580
secure code and that will make it easier

473
00:20:08,580 --> 00:20:12,020
for you as an experienced person to also

474
00:20:12,020 --> 00:20:15,809
show you the experience that you have in

475
00:20:15,809 --> 00:20:20,640
your code this is just an example of a

476
00:20:20,640 --> 00:20:23,940
cultural fit I think the way we learn

477
00:20:23,940 --> 00:20:28,290
about things has moved on from the past

478
00:20:28,290 --> 00:20:30,780
old-school training the way we want to

479
00:20:30,780 --> 00:20:33,330
learn a language is is no longer in

480
00:20:33,330 --> 00:20:37,650
school it's it's no longer with with a

481
00:20:37,650 --> 00:20:39,150
particular style I think it's more

482
00:20:39,150 --> 00:20:42,030
duolingo style and if you if you look at

483
00:20:42,030 --> 00:20:44,640
the number of people trying to learn a

484
00:20:44,640 --> 00:20:46,770
language through different systems well

485
00:20:46,770 --> 00:20:49,049
then it is clear that systems like

486
00:20:49,049 --> 00:20:52,230
duolingo and and similar systems get a

487
00:20:52,230 --> 00:20:54,299
lot of ratings get a lot of attention

488
00:20:54,299 --> 00:20:56,490
and get a lot of people going through

489
00:20:56,490 --> 00:21:02,040
their systems automation I was thinking

490
00:21:02,040 --> 00:21:05,940
like hey on in DevOps and how can we

491
00:21:05,940 --> 00:21:11,100
make sure that we get security embedded

492
00:21:11,100 --> 00:21:13,350
in there and there's a lot of automation

493
00:21:13,350 --> 00:21:18,150
going in in there's a lot of automation

494
00:21:18,150 --> 00:21:20,250
going on but how can we make sure that

495
00:21:20,250 --> 00:21:22,860
we do not stop the developer because

496
00:21:22,860 --> 00:21:25,350
quite often I think security is

497
00:21:25,350 --> 00:21:27,840
considered as the blocker in the whole

498
00:21:27,840 --> 00:21:31,559
system you know people say man they're

499
00:21:31,559 --> 00:21:33,510
the guys from security or they're we did

500
00:21:33,510 --> 00:21:34,919
something wrong they're gonna stop us

501
00:21:34,919 --> 00:21:37,679
again and if we're doing automation if

502
00:21:37,679 --> 00:21:39,480
we're trying to automate us as much as

503
00:21:39,480 --> 00:21:42,510
we can and security is going to embed

504
00:21:42,510 --> 00:21:44,460
their things in there we have to make

505
00:21:44,460 --> 00:21:46,830
sure that we do not annoy the developers

506
00:21:46,830 --> 00:21:49,590
right so first of all a couple of hints

507
00:21:49,590 --> 00:21:53,700
how to approach software security and

508
00:21:53,700 --> 00:21:56,010
automation first of all I think and it

509
00:21:56,010 --> 00:21:58,080
and I'm saying the obvious here but take

510
00:21:58,080 --> 00:22:00,030
some tools that work for your technology

511
00:22:00,030 --> 00:22:03,570
and your company culture it's it's a

512
00:22:03,570 --> 00:22:05,790
pretty obvious one but but all too often

513
00:22:05,790 --> 00:22:09,360
I see companies picking a tool

514
00:22:09,360 --> 00:22:11,429
a solution that doesn't really fit the

515
00:22:11,429 --> 00:22:14,010
technology stack or not the technology

516
00:22:14,010 --> 00:22:15,780
stack across the organization

517
00:22:15,780 --> 00:22:17,580
pick something that really works for

518
00:22:17,580 --> 00:22:19,880
your organization for your culture

519
00:22:19,880 --> 00:22:24,030
second don't slow down the developers

520
00:22:24,030 --> 00:22:26,700
and I've once heard about the coffee

521
00:22:26,700 --> 00:22:29,520
test which is hey if you're going away

522
00:22:29,520 --> 00:22:31,799
from your desk and you come back you

523
00:22:31,799 --> 00:22:33,210
know if you take a coffee and you come

524
00:22:33,210 --> 00:22:35,549
back within five minutes your test

525
00:22:35,549 --> 00:22:37,650
should be run which means that

526
00:22:37,650 --> 00:22:39,390
everything that you can cram in these

527
00:22:39,390 --> 00:22:42,090
five minutes as many security tests as

528
00:22:42,090 --> 00:22:45,179
possible get them in there but not more

529
00:22:45,179 --> 00:22:47,970
if it's more than five minutes well take

530
00:22:47,970 --> 00:22:50,700
out the tests that are more than five

531
00:22:50,700 --> 00:22:53,429
minutes and either paralyze the rest or

532
00:22:53,429 --> 00:22:56,100
move that to a nightly build or do

533
00:22:56,100 --> 00:22:58,380
whatever but do not stop the developer

534
00:22:58,380 --> 00:23:00,690
don't go over these this this coffee

535
00:23:00,690 --> 00:23:03,390
test which is five minutes maybe seven

536
00:23:03,390 --> 00:23:05,370
minutes maybe three pick a number

537
00:23:05,370 --> 00:23:08,450
but you know do not annoy the developer

538
00:23:08,450 --> 00:23:11,450
third point is it is very similar

539
00:23:11,450 --> 00:23:14,630
you should only as a security person

540
00:23:14,630 --> 00:23:17,669
break the release or stop the release if

541
00:23:17,669 --> 00:23:20,580
you're really really really sure again

542
00:23:20,580 --> 00:23:22,950
do not annoy the developer you know if

543
00:23:22,950 --> 00:23:26,100
you're not sure flag it make sure it

544
00:23:26,100 --> 00:23:28,230
goes to security for review or whatever

545
00:23:28,230 --> 00:23:30,210
but if you're not sure do not blade

546
00:23:30,210 --> 00:23:31,919
break do the release but if you are sure

547
00:23:31,919 --> 00:23:33,450
you have to break it of course if there

548
00:23:33,450 --> 00:23:35,549
are security grain chills going into

549
00:23:35,549 --> 00:23:40,350
production well you should stop it for

550
00:23:40,350 --> 00:23:43,320
fun integrate with the way developers

551
00:23:43,320 --> 00:23:45,660
work these days if I look at our

552
00:23:45,660 --> 00:23:48,330
organization developers do not read

553
00:23:48,330 --> 00:23:51,450
email in our organization they no longer

554
00:23:51,450 --> 00:23:54,179
read email it's it's slack it's all

555
00:23:54,179 --> 00:23:56,520
sorts of things but it's not email so

556
00:23:56,520 --> 00:23:58,679
the way we communicate with them it has

557
00:23:58,679 --> 00:24:01,410
to integrate and also for for security

558
00:24:01,410 --> 00:24:03,150
systems we have to integrate with their

559
00:24:03,150 --> 00:24:06,150
way of working sending a nightly email

560
00:24:06,150 --> 00:24:09,750
with updates or whatever it may be that

561
00:24:09,750 --> 00:24:11,100
two weeks from now they're gonna read

562
00:24:11,100 --> 00:24:15,150
that email and last but not least just

563
00:24:15,150 --> 00:24:16,470
like and everything that we do

564
00:24:16,470 --> 00:24:18,360
everything has to be in standalone

565
00:24:18,360 --> 00:24:20,730
containers for tests and no dependencies

566
00:24:20,730 --> 00:24:22,050
it should run our search

567
00:24:22,050 --> 00:24:24,390
you can spin something up or take

568
00:24:24,390 --> 00:24:25,830
something down without breaking

569
00:24:25,830 --> 00:24:31,800
everything measurements I thought about

570
00:24:31,800 --> 00:24:35,670
measurement the same way you know again

571
00:24:35,670 --> 00:24:37,920
we're always seen as blockers security

572
00:24:37,920 --> 00:24:39,930
is always seen as blockers not as

573
00:24:39,930 --> 00:24:42,720
enablers and and quite often that has to

574
00:24:42,720 --> 00:24:45,690
do with how we measure thing things if

575
00:24:45,690 --> 00:24:48,300
an okay are for security is how many

576
00:24:48,300 --> 00:24:50,280
vulnerabilities can you find in a year

577
00:24:50,280 --> 00:24:52,950
well obviously you will be seen as a

578
00:24:52,950 --> 00:24:55,560
blocker so we should again move away

579
00:24:55,560 --> 00:24:58,920
from these old school things these old

580
00:24:58,920 --> 00:25:00,780
school measurements like number of

581
00:25:00,780 --> 00:25:03,600
vulnerabilities that a security person

582
00:25:03,600 --> 00:25:06,390
can find but we should go into a mode

583
00:25:06,390 --> 00:25:08,400
where we help the developer and we

584
00:25:08,400 --> 00:25:10,950
actually enable them and we try to get

585
00:25:10,950 --> 00:25:13,860
something in production by helping them

586
00:25:13,860 --> 00:25:15,630
fixing the problem not by just saying

587
00:25:15,630 --> 00:25:18,960
yes whatever ship it no no by by making

588
00:25:18,960 --> 00:25:20,940
sure that we help the developer getting

589
00:25:20,940 --> 00:25:23,660
something in production and it's hard

590
00:25:23,660 --> 00:25:26,670
but for sure there are ways to measure

591
00:25:26,670 --> 00:25:29,670
it the right way and to help the

592
00:25:29,670 --> 00:25:32,640
developer and there are ways to measure

593
00:25:32,640 --> 00:25:34,920
the wrong way for example one way to

594
00:25:34,920 --> 00:25:37,440
measure in an incorrect way is for

595
00:25:37,440 --> 00:25:40,980
example mean time to failure we

596
00:25:40,980 --> 00:25:42,810
essentially want to fail we want to fail

597
00:25:42,810 --> 00:25:45,810
fast we do not want to lengthen that

598
00:25:45,810 --> 00:25:49,020
period of not failing because that

599
00:25:49,020 --> 00:25:50,520
that's artificial and that's actually

600
00:25:50,520 --> 00:25:52,590
pushing the problems out what you want

601
00:25:52,590 --> 00:25:55,350
to do is you want to fail fast but you

602
00:25:55,350 --> 00:25:57,960
want to recover fast so it is better to

603
00:25:57,960 --> 00:26:00,630
figure out how can we recover very fast

604
00:26:00,630 --> 00:26:03,120
and put some metrics around hey let's

605
00:26:03,120 --> 00:26:05,100
make sure there's something in place so

606
00:26:05,100 --> 00:26:07,560
that we can recover very fast instead of

607
00:26:07,560 --> 00:26:09,810
trying to lengthen the time by which we

608
00:26:09,810 --> 00:26:15,210
are failing last but not least the fifth

609
00:26:15,210 --> 00:26:18,600
one sharing what it is not and I think

610
00:26:18,600 --> 00:26:20,760
the app SEC days where we write

611
00:26:20,760 --> 00:26:22,950
documents and we send that to developers

612
00:26:22,950 --> 00:26:25,380
or over I think and if you're still an

613
00:26:25,380 --> 00:26:27,600
application security person that is

614
00:26:27,600 --> 00:26:29,760
writing countless documents to ship it

615
00:26:29,760 --> 00:26:33,540
to a developer well I I have bad news

616
00:26:33,540 --> 00:26:36,040
for you I think it's not gonna work

617
00:26:36,040 --> 00:26:39,880
I think today a security person an

618
00:26:39,880 --> 00:26:42,010
application security person should be

619
00:26:42,010 --> 00:26:44,230
able to code should be unable to

620
00:26:44,230 --> 00:26:47,140
understand technology should be able to

621
00:26:47,140 --> 00:26:48,660
help the developer and have a meaningful

622
00:26:48,660 --> 00:26:51,400
conversation with the developer and not

623
00:26:51,400 --> 00:26:54,220
only about how broken the system is but

624
00:26:54,220 --> 00:26:56,830
how can he help to make sure that the

625
00:26:56,830 --> 00:27:00,520
system is secure how can we do that well

626
00:27:00,520 --> 00:27:03,130
I think we need to break the cycle of

627
00:27:03,130 --> 00:27:04,570
recurring vulnerabilities what does that

628
00:27:04,570 --> 00:27:07,570
mean today a lot of information in the

629
00:27:07,570 --> 00:27:10,840
sharing at the left-hand side is lost if

630
00:27:10,840 --> 00:27:13,600
you're fixing a problem in your code if

631
00:27:13,600 --> 00:27:16,630
you're fixing a vulnerability the moment

632
00:27:16,630 --> 00:27:18,400
you close it in your bird tracking

633
00:27:18,400 --> 00:27:21,370
system that information is lost that

634
00:27:21,370 --> 00:27:23,950
information is just gone and when your

635
00:27:23,950 --> 00:27:25,360
developer actually leaves the

636
00:27:25,360 --> 00:27:27,400
organization that information is

637
00:27:27,400 --> 00:27:31,020
entirely gone so what we need to do as

638
00:27:31,020 --> 00:27:35,890
security is we have to find a very nifty

639
00:27:35,890 --> 00:27:38,620
technology in a way that we can share

640
00:27:38,620 --> 00:27:41,920
information amongst developers if you're

641
00:27:41,920 --> 00:27:44,230
fixing a problem if you're closing that

642
00:27:44,230 --> 00:27:46,540
bug in your bird tracking system you

643
00:27:46,540 --> 00:27:48,220
should be able to share through

644
00:27:48,220 --> 00:27:50,920
technology and inform your your peer

645
00:27:50,920 --> 00:27:53,170
developers about how you fix something

646
00:27:53,170 --> 00:27:56,770
so that they do not make that same

647
00:27:56,770 --> 00:27:59,380
mistake or if that mistake is made that

648
00:27:59,380 --> 00:28:01,450
they know how to fix it and again it's

649
00:28:01,450 --> 00:28:03,550
not by writing endless documents and PDF

650
00:28:03,550 --> 00:28:06,040
pages and wiki pages no we should do

651
00:28:06,040 --> 00:28:08,170
that through our IDE and through

652
00:28:08,170 --> 00:28:11,590
technology through or our CI CD we

653
00:28:11,590 --> 00:28:13,270
should be able to make sure that that

654
00:28:13,270 --> 00:28:16,600
information flows to other developers

655
00:28:16,600 --> 00:28:19,390
and that they are informed as quick as

656
00:28:19,390 --> 00:28:21,370
possible if that's possible in their IDE

657
00:28:21,370 --> 00:28:23,830
then we do it in the IDE if it's in some

658
00:28:23,830 --> 00:28:27,640
testing we do it in some testing in

659
00:28:27,640 --> 00:28:30,400
conclusion I hope I was able to give you

660
00:28:30,400 --> 00:28:33,730
a couple of the blockers of the past

661
00:28:33,730 --> 00:28:36,990
where we think while we're still in this

662
00:28:36,990 --> 00:28:40,630
scenario a problem that was found 22

663
00:28:40,630 --> 00:28:43,030
years ago is still a problem today why

664
00:28:43,030 --> 00:28:45,370
was that we identified a couple blockers

665
00:28:45,370 --> 00:28:48,340
in there and in the second half of the

666
00:28:48,340 --> 00:28:49,570
of this talk I

667
00:28:49,570 --> 00:28:51,970
she tried to figure out how to put

668
00:28:51,970 --> 00:28:54,220
security and application security into

669
00:28:54,220 --> 00:28:56,410
the culture into the automation into the

670
00:28:56,410 --> 00:28:58,120
measurement and into the sharing and

671
00:28:58,120 --> 00:29:01,600
with a big focus of not annoying the

672
00:29:01,600 --> 00:29:09,970
developer any questions all right

673
00:29:09,970 --> 00:29:12,940

675
00:29:15,580 --> 00:29:17,530
topics that I know you know we've been

676
00:29:17,530 --> 00:29:20,350
struggling with for plenty of years and

677
00:29:20,350 --> 00:29:22,060
security how do we get security tied

678
00:29:22,060 --> 00:29:26,920
into these DevOps processes um let's see

679
00:29:26,920 --> 00:29:28,870
