doing this it's not just

11
00:00:23,840 --> 00:00:26,960
for another technology conference

12
00:00:26,960 --> 00:00:30,000
it's to help raise money for uh

13
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:33,360
the who um and we're really really

14
00:00:33,360 --> 00:00:35,440
thankful that you're one of the people

15
00:00:35,440 --> 00:00:39,520
that just joined us in helping not only

16
00:00:39,520 --> 00:00:41,680
gain attention to the technology we want

17
00:00:41,680 --> 00:00:42,719
to talk about

18
00:00:42,719 --> 00:00:45,120
uh or or the other things but just

19
00:00:45,120 --> 00:00:46,399

given money

35
00:01:18,080 --> 00:01:21,200
and um i know that patrick and everyone

50
00:01:56,799 --> 00:01:57,439
everyone

51
00:01:57,439 --> 00:01:59,200
thank you so much for tuning in at the

52
00:01:59,200 --> 00:02:00,640
late hour if you're on the

53
00:02:00,640 --> 00:02:03,119
west coast or the east coast my name is

54
00:02:03,119 --> 00:02:04,000
alana brown

55
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:06,719
and i work for a company called puppet a

56
00:02:06,719 --> 00:02:08,639
little known fact about me you may have

57
00:02:08,639 --> 00:02:10,479
caught gene's talk and you mentioned the

58
00:02:10,479 --> 00:02:11,760
state of devops report

59
00:02:11,760 --> 00:02:13,040
well i actually started the state of

60
00:02:13,040 --> 00:02:15,440
devops report um eight years ago

61
00:02:15,440 --> 00:02:17,920
and today it is the longest standing

62
00:02:17,920 --> 00:02:19,599
most widely referenced

63
00:02:19,599 --> 00:02:22,319
piece of research on the topic of devops

64
00:02:22,319 --> 00:02:23,040
today

65
00:02:23,040 --> 00:02:26,560
so very proud of that i have spent the

66
00:02:26,560 --> 00:02:26,959
past

67
00:02:26,959 --> 00:02:29,520
eight years serving over 33 000

68
00:02:29,520 --> 00:02:31,120
technical professionals from

69
00:02:31,120 --> 00:02:32,959
all around the world thank you if you've

70
00:02:32,959 --> 00:02:34,319
taken the survey

71
00:02:34,319 --> 00:02:36,319
i've also worked very closely with many

72
00:02:36,319 --> 00:02:38,480
of you in the devops community

73
00:02:38,480 --> 00:02:40,800
and with our puppet customers which

74
00:02:40,800 --> 00:02:42,879
comprise some of the largest

75
00:02:42,879 --> 00:02:45,360
most complex organizations in the world

76
00:02:45,360 --> 00:02:46,400
so i've really seen

77
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:49,280
firsthand how organizations adopt and

78
00:02:49,280 --> 00:02:51,200
scale devops practices

79
00:02:51,200 --> 00:02:53,519
where they get stuck and the outcomes

80
00:02:53,519 --> 00:02:55,040
they see when they're able to move

81
00:02:55,040 --> 00:02:57,519
beyond some of the barriers

82
00:02:57,519 --> 00:02:59,840
so our last report is the 2019 state of

83
00:02:59,840 --> 00:03:02,000
devops report and it focuses

84
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:04,400
on what i think is one of the most

85
00:03:04,400 --> 00:03:06,239
challenging aspects

86
00:03:06,239 --> 00:03:09,040
of security of devops which is

87
00:03:09,040 --> 00:03:10,959
integrating security

88
00:03:10,959 --> 00:03:13,599
practices and policies into the software

89
00:03:13,599 --> 00:03:15,440
delivery life cycle

90
00:03:15,440 --> 00:03:18,319
and security is often seen as a

91
00:03:18,319 --> 00:03:19,200
bottleneck

92
00:03:19,200 --> 00:03:22,159
in the devops initiative but our

93
00:03:22,159 --> 00:03:23,760
research really shows

94
00:03:23,760 --> 00:03:26,159
that integrating security early and

95
00:03:26,159 --> 00:03:28,080
often actually delivers real

96
00:03:28,080 --> 00:03:31,040
results even if the path to get there

97
00:03:31,040 --> 00:03:33,840
isn't straightforward

98
00:03:33,840 --> 00:03:36,560
so why is it so hard to integrate

99
00:03:36,560 --> 00:03:39,200
security into the software delivery life

100
00:03:39,200 --> 00:03:40,159
cycle

101
00:03:40,159 --> 00:03:43,120
i really truly believe that devops is

102
00:03:43,120 --> 00:03:44,560
first and foremost

103
00:03:44,560 --> 00:03:48,319
about people and culture and culture is

104
00:03:48,319 --> 00:03:51,360
largely defined by how you incentivize

105
00:03:51,360 --> 00:03:54,159
people to do their work and if you think

106
00:03:54,159 --> 00:03:54,959
about it

107
00:03:54,959 --> 00:03:57,760
devops teams are incentivized to build

108
00:03:57,760 --> 00:03:59,680
and deliver new features as jay was

109
00:03:59,680 --> 00:04:00,080
saying

110
00:04:00,080 --> 00:04:02,879
earlier so they can get to market faster

111
00:04:02,879 --> 00:04:04,080
and this is the thing that gives

112
00:04:04,080 --> 00:04:06,239
companies their competitive edge in this

113
00:04:06,239 --> 00:04:07,280
day and age

114
00:04:07,280 --> 00:04:09,519
security on the other hand isn't a

115
00:04:09,519 --> 00:04:11,599
competitive differentiator for most

116
00:04:11,599 --> 00:04:14,959
companies so the bottom line is that

117
00:04:14,959 --> 00:04:17,279
good security doesn't pay the bills and

118
00:04:17,279 --> 00:04:19,120
so it doesn't get prioritized by the

119
00:04:19,120 --> 00:04:21,279
business

120
00:04:21,279 --> 00:04:23,280
but why should we care about this in the

121
00:04:23,280 --> 00:04:24,560
first place well

122
00:04:24,560 --> 00:04:27,120
from a business perspective integrating

123
00:04:27,120 --> 00:04:29,440
quality and security earlier in the

124
00:04:29,440 --> 00:04:31,360
software delivery life cycle

125
00:04:31,360 --> 00:04:33,840
is so much cheaper than the waterfall

126
00:04:33,840 --> 00:04:34,880
alternative

127
00:04:34,880 --> 00:04:37,520
according to this study by ibm systems

128
00:04:37,520 --> 00:04:38,960
science institute that was done a little

129
00:04:38,960 --> 00:04:40,479
while ago but

130
00:04:40,479 --> 00:04:42,160
i've seen it validated across other

131
00:04:42,160 --> 00:04:43,600
studies it costs

132
00:04:43,600 --> 00:04:46,240
six times more to fix a bug found during

133
00:04:46,240 --> 00:04:47,600
implementation

134
00:04:47,600 --> 00:04:50,000
15 times more to fix that same bug in

135
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:50,720
testing

136
00:04:50,720 --> 00:04:53,280
and 100 times more once the code is

137
00:04:53,280 --> 00:04:53,759
running

138
00:04:53,759 --> 00:04:56,960
in production so as you can see building

139
00:04:56,960 --> 00:04:58,000
security in

140
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:00,880
from the start is simply a good business

141
00:05:00,880 --> 00:05:02,960
practice

142
00:05:02,960 --> 00:05:06,240
but like i get it this is not easy

143
00:05:06,240 --> 00:05:08,320
we actually recently collaborated with

144
00:05:08,320 --> 00:05:09,520
sneak

145
00:05:09,520 --> 00:05:12,639
on their devsecops report which is based

146
00:05:12,639 --> 00:05:14,479
on the state of devops report

147
00:05:14,479 --> 00:05:16,960
and their 2019 state of open source

148
00:05:16,960 --> 00:05:18,080
security report

149
00:05:18,080 --> 00:05:20,240
it is a fantastic read so i highly

150
00:05:20,240 --> 00:05:22,080
recommend it if you haven't taken a look

151
00:05:22,080 --> 00:05:22,720
yet

152
00:05:22,720 --> 00:05:25,600
but they found that not only are the

153
00:05:25,600 --> 00:05:28,080
number of vulnerabilities exponentially

154
00:05:28,080 --> 00:05:29,199
increasing year

155
00:05:29,199 --> 00:05:31,840
after year but the majority of those

156
00:05:31,840 --> 00:05:33,600
vulnerabilities are actually found in

157
00:05:33,600 --> 00:05:35,600
indirect dependencies

158
00:05:35,600 --> 00:05:38,639
furthermore most developers aren't

159
00:05:38,639 --> 00:05:41,039
implementing sufficient testing to catch

160
00:05:41,039 --> 00:05:42,560
those vulnerabilities

161
00:05:42,560 --> 00:05:44,639
and even if they are aware that the

162
00:05:44,639 --> 00:05:47,039
vulnerabilities exist it can take years

163
00:05:47,039 --> 00:05:49,680
for them to actually fix them

164
00:05:49,680 --> 00:05:51,520
and you know this is so common i was

165
00:05:51,520 --> 00:05:54,560
talking to one of our customers recently

166
00:05:54,560 --> 00:05:56,400
and he was telling me that they can only

167
00:05:56,400 --> 00:05:57,759
fix about 10

168
00:05:57,759 --> 00:05:59,919
of their vulnerabilities today because

169
00:05:59,919 --> 00:06:02,400
they have a ton of heavy manual process

170
00:06:02,400 --> 00:06:05,280
and a lot of bureaucracy in general and

171
00:06:05,280 --> 00:06:06,000
the business

172
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:07,520
really never wants to take down a

173
00:06:07,520 --> 00:06:09,600
revenue generating app ever

174
00:06:09,600 --> 00:06:13,199
so it can take 90 to 180 days to get an

175
00:06:13,199 --> 00:06:14,160
open window

176
00:06:14,160 --> 00:06:17,199
to do the patching

177
00:06:17,360 --> 00:06:19,759
so i just want to jump in to some of the

178
00:06:19,759 --> 00:06:20,960
key findings from the

179
00:06:20,960 --> 00:06:23,759
report and the first finding may seem

180
00:06:23,759 --> 00:06:24,880
obvious but

181
00:06:24,880 --> 00:06:26,880
we found that if you're doing devops

182
00:06:26,880 --> 00:06:29,600
well you're probably doing security well

183
00:06:29,600 --> 00:06:31,360
and if you're doing security well you're

184
00:06:31,360 --> 00:06:34,080
probably already doing devops well

185
00:06:34,080 --> 00:06:36,880
let's talk about what that means in our

186
00:06:36,880 --> 00:06:37,919
2018

187
00:06:37,919 --> 00:06:41,120
state of devops report we looked at the

188
00:06:41,120 --> 00:06:42,479
evolution

189
00:06:42,479 --> 00:06:45,520
of devops as organizations adopt and

190
00:06:45,520 --> 00:06:47,680
scale their devops practices

191
00:06:47,680 --> 00:06:49,360
and we found that there are actually

192
00:06:49,360 --> 00:06:50,720
five distinct

193
00:06:50,720 --> 00:06:53,919
stages in the devops evolution and at

194
00:06:53,919 --> 00:06:54,560
the most

195
00:06:54,560 --> 00:06:57,440
advanced stages it's really interesting

196
00:06:57,440 --> 00:06:58,400
because firms

197
00:06:58,400 --> 00:07:01,039
are starting to apply more automation to

198
00:07:01,039 --> 00:07:01,520
cons

199
00:07:01,520 --> 00:07:04,639
to security considerations so the teams

200
00:07:04,639 --> 00:07:06,960
are automating their security policy

201
00:07:06,960 --> 00:07:08,319
configurations

202
00:07:08,319 --> 00:07:09,919
they've automated their incident

203
00:07:09,919 --> 00:07:11,360
response and

204
00:07:11,360 --> 00:07:14,000
the security teams are deeply involved

205
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:17,840
in the technology design and deployment

206
00:07:17,840 --> 00:07:19,520
and this makes a ton of sense if you

207
00:07:19,520 --> 00:07:21,199
already have all of these

208
00:07:21,199 --> 00:07:24,479
foundational devops practices in place

209
00:07:24,479 --> 00:07:26,720
then your application like you know your

210
00:07:26,720 --> 00:07:28,800
application and infrastructure code

211
00:07:28,800 --> 00:07:30,800
are already in version control you're

212
00:07:30,800 --> 00:07:32,639
doing continuous integration with

213
00:07:32,639 --> 00:07:34,080
automated testing

214
00:07:34,080 --> 00:07:36,240
you've automated your deployments then

215
00:07:36,240 --> 00:07:38,960
really making a security related change

216
00:07:38,960 --> 00:07:41,199
is no different than making any other

217
00:07:41,199 --> 00:07:42,000
change

218
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:45,039
in your system so our 2018 report has a

219
00:07:45,039 --> 00:07:47,360
lot more prescriptive guidance on each

220
00:07:47,360 --> 00:07:49,120
of these stages so i recommend checking

221
00:07:49,120 --> 00:07:49,919
that out

222
00:07:49,919 --> 00:07:51,440
if you're interested in learning more

223
00:07:51,440 --> 00:07:55,120
about the devops evolution model

224
00:07:55,280 --> 00:07:57,360
all right so this chart it's a little

225
00:07:57,360 --> 00:07:59,120
hard to read but it shows how

226
00:07:59,120 --> 00:08:01,599
the percentage of orgs that are highly

227
00:08:01,599 --> 00:08:03,520
evolved in terms of their devops

228
00:08:03,520 --> 00:08:04,479
practices

229
00:08:04,479 --> 00:08:07,199
it actually increases at each level of

230
00:08:07,199 --> 00:08:08,160
security

231
00:08:08,160 --> 00:08:09,840
integration so we overlaid those two

232
00:08:09,840 --> 00:08:12,400
things and as you can see from level

233
00:08:12,400 --> 00:08:12,960
five

234
00:08:12,960 --> 00:08:16,319
the highest level of integration 22

235
00:08:16,319 --> 00:08:17,599
of firms at the highest level of

236
00:08:17,599 --> 00:08:20,080
security integration are also at a very

237
00:08:20,080 --> 00:08:24,240
advanced stage of devops evolution

238
00:08:24,400 --> 00:08:26,319
so our second finding is that we also

239
00:08:26,319 --> 00:08:28,400
found that as security becomes

240
00:08:28,400 --> 00:08:31,520
more integrated confidence in security

241
00:08:31,520 --> 00:08:32,240
posture

242
00:08:32,240 --> 00:08:34,719
actually improves again this should be

243
00:08:34,719 --> 00:08:36,559
pretty obvious to anyone who's been

244
00:08:36,559 --> 00:08:38,080
paying attention to devops

245
00:08:38,080 --> 00:08:40,559
in the last couple of years there's a

246
00:08:40,559 --> 00:08:42,320
reason why collaboration

247
00:08:42,320 --> 00:08:44,240
is one of the pillars of devops it's

248
00:08:44,240 --> 00:08:46,240
because collaboration builds

249
00:08:46,240 --> 00:08:49,760
trust and trust builds confidence

250
00:08:49,760 --> 00:08:53,040
so what this is showing us is that 81

251
00:08:53,040 --> 00:08:55,920
if you are 82 if you look at the far

252
00:08:55,920 --> 00:08:57,760
right of the blue bar

253
00:08:57,760 --> 00:09:00,959
82 of the respondents at firms with

254
00:09:00,959 --> 00:09:03,600
high levels of integration felt that

255
00:09:03,600 --> 00:09:05,760
their security policies and practices

256
00:09:05,760 --> 00:09:08,080
actually significantly improve their

257
00:09:08,080 --> 00:09:09,680
security posture

258
00:09:09,680 --> 00:09:12,480
compare that with respondents at firms

259
00:09:12,480 --> 00:09:13,120
with no

260
00:09:13,120 --> 00:09:15,040
security integration which is that red

261
00:09:15,040 --> 00:09:16,160
bar

262
00:09:16,160 --> 00:09:19,920
level one just 38 had that level of

263
00:09:19,920 --> 00:09:21,200
confidence

264
00:09:21,200 --> 00:09:23,760
now that doesn't necessarily mean that

265
00:09:23,760 --> 00:09:25,120
they are actually

266
00:09:25,120 --> 00:09:26,399
more secure because that's something

267
00:09:26,399 --> 00:09:28,240
that's very hard to measure

268
00:09:28,240 --> 00:09:30,480
but what's more important here i think

269
00:09:30,480 --> 00:09:31,440
is the

270
00:09:31,440 --> 00:09:34,640
the shift in mindset when there

271
00:09:34,640 --> 00:09:37,680
is no integration there's usually a lack

272
00:09:37,680 --> 00:09:40,720
of understanding of the work involved in

273
00:09:40,720 --> 00:09:42,240
security and also

274
00:09:42,240 --> 00:09:44,959
to be frank a lot of cynicism around it

275
00:09:44,959 --> 00:09:45,519
but

276
00:09:45,519 --> 00:09:48,480
when teams are fully integrated there's

277
00:09:48,480 --> 00:09:49,200
a mutual

278
00:09:49,200 --> 00:09:51,519
understanding people feel like the

279
00:09:51,519 --> 00:09:53,120
things they're being asked to do

280
00:09:53,120 --> 00:09:55,519
really do matter which makes them more

281
00:09:55,519 --> 00:09:58,560
likely to do them

282
00:09:58,959 --> 00:10:01,519
so we wanted to know which practices

283
00:10:01,519 --> 00:10:03,040
actually had the greatest

284
00:10:03,040 --> 00:10:06,560
impact on the team's confidence and

285
00:10:06,560 --> 00:10:08,720
surprisingly or maybe not surprisingly

286
00:10:08,720 --> 00:10:09,839
interestingly

287
00:10:09,839 --> 00:10:12,320
the practices that require really strong

288
00:10:12,320 --> 00:10:13,200
collaboration

289
00:10:13,200 --> 00:10:15,760
up front we're actually the top

290
00:10:15,760 --> 00:10:16,959
confidence builders

291
00:10:16,959 --> 00:10:20,480
so it's not just about shifting security

292
00:10:20,480 --> 00:10:22,640
checks to the left it's about

293
00:10:22,640 --> 00:10:23,760
fundamentally

294
00:10:23,760 --> 00:10:26,240
changing how everyone works together at

295
00:10:26,240 --> 00:10:26,959
the beginning

296
00:10:26,959 --> 00:10:29,600
of the pipeline so the top five

297
00:10:29,600 --> 00:10:31,760
practices that improve security posture

298
00:10:31,760 --> 00:10:34,320
our security and development teams

299
00:10:34,320 --> 00:10:36,079
collaborate on threat models

300
00:10:36,079 --> 00:10:38,720
and threat models are a great exercise

301
00:10:38,720 --> 00:10:39,200
so

302
00:10:39,200 --> 00:10:41,279
uh for anyone who's doing that today

303
00:10:41,279 --> 00:10:42,560
kudos to you

304
00:10:42,560 --> 00:10:45,040
um it can be awkward at first but i've

305
00:10:45,040 --> 00:10:46,480
heard from a lot of people that once

306
00:10:46,480 --> 00:10:47,519
they get into it

307
00:10:47,519 --> 00:10:49,040
it's actually a really meaningful

308
00:10:49,040 --> 00:10:51,120
exercise for the whole team

309
00:10:51,120 --> 00:10:53,279
security tools are integrated in the

310
00:10:53,279 --> 00:10:55,279
development integration pipeline

311
00:10:55,279 --> 00:10:57,360
and that's so engineers can be confident

312
00:10:57,360 --> 00:10:59,440
that they're not actually inadvertently

313
00:10:59,440 --> 00:11:00,720
introducing

314
00:11:00,720 --> 00:11:02,640
known security problems into their code

315
00:11:02,640 --> 00:11:03,839
bases

316
00:11:03,839 --> 00:11:06,480
security requirements are prioritized as

317
00:11:06,480 --> 00:11:06,880
part

318
00:11:06,880 --> 00:11:09,279
of the product backlog which both

319
00:11:09,279 --> 00:11:10,000
assumes an

320
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:12,880
agile way of working and includes both

321
00:11:12,880 --> 00:11:14,480
functional and non-functional

322
00:11:14,480 --> 00:11:16,240
requirements as well

323
00:11:16,240 --> 00:11:18,320
infrastructure related security policies

324
00:11:18,320 --> 00:11:20,000
are reviewed before deployment

325
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:22,240
again there is the assumption that the

326
00:11:22,240 --> 00:11:24,160
infrastructure teams

327
00:11:24,160 --> 00:11:25,519
are working really closely with the

328
00:11:25,519 --> 00:11:27,120
security teams to make sure that those

329
00:11:27,120 --> 00:11:28,720
reviews are happening

330
00:11:28,720 --> 00:11:31,600
and security tests evaluate automated

331
00:11:31,600 --> 00:11:33,279
our security experts evaluate

332
00:11:33,279 --> 00:11:36,560
automated tests and this means that they

333
00:11:36,560 --> 00:11:37,200
are able

334
00:11:37,200 --> 00:11:40,640
to review the tests and

335
00:11:40,640 --> 00:11:43,120
then they're called to manually review

336
00:11:43,120 --> 00:11:44,720
things that are high risk

337
00:11:44,720 --> 00:11:46,560
such as authentication systems

338
00:11:46,560 --> 00:11:48,240
cryptography etc

339
00:11:48,240 --> 00:11:50,959
versus reviewing all the minutiae so

340
00:11:50,959 --> 00:11:52,160
i'll say it again

341
00:11:52,160 --> 00:11:54,320
collaboration builds trust and trust

342
00:11:54,320 --> 00:11:57,279
builds confidence

343
00:11:57,279 --> 00:11:59,839
okay so our third key finding is that

344
00:11:59,839 --> 00:12:02,079
integrating security actually leads to

345
00:12:02,079 --> 00:12:05,760
positive business outcomes

346
00:12:05,760 --> 00:12:08,000
so i know this is a lot to look at but

347
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:09,839
at the highest level of security

348
00:12:09,839 --> 00:12:10,560
integration

349
00:12:10,560 --> 00:12:12,880
firms are actually able to deploy on

350
00:12:12,880 --> 00:12:15,839
demand more frequently than their peers

351
00:12:15,839 --> 00:12:18,160
now we have always asked about

352
00:12:18,160 --> 00:12:19,680
deployment frequency

353
00:12:19,680 --> 00:12:21,920
but this year we asked two questions

354
00:12:21,920 --> 00:12:22,959
about deployment

355
00:12:22,959 --> 00:12:26,240
frequency how often can you deploy

356
00:12:26,240 --> 00:12:29,360
versus how often do you actually deploy

357
00:12:29,360 --> 00:12:31,680
because nowadays we know of enough

358
00:12:31,680 --> 00:12:32,880
organizations

359
00:12:32,880 --> 00:12:34,880
that can deploy more frequently than the

360
00:12:34,880 --> 00:12:37,440
business or their customers even require

361
00:12:37,440 --> 00:12:40,240
so oftentimes they're told to hold on

362
00:12:40,240 --> 00:12:41,680
that deployment

363
00:12:41,680 --> 00:12:44,639
so if you just focus on that teal bar on

364
00:12:44,639 --> 00:12:45,040
the

365
00:12:45,040 --> 00:12:49,040
far left you can see that 61

366
00:12:49,040 --> 00:12:51,920
of the highly integrated organizations

367
00:12:51,920 --> 00:12:54,800
are able to deploy on demand compared to

368
00:12:54,800 --> 00:12:56,240
49

369
00:12:56,240 --> 00:12:59,200
of organizations with no integration and

370
00:12:59,200 --> 00:13:00,800
that is significantly

371
00:13:00,800 --> 00:13:04,839
higher than firms at all other levels of

372
00:13:04,839 --> 00:13:07,760
integration

373
00:13:07,760 --> 00:13:09,360
so the highest levels of security

374
00:13:09,360 --> 00:13:11,279
integration firms are also able to

375
00:13:11,279 --> 00:13:12,800
remediate critical for

376
00:13:12,800 --> 00:13:15,279
vulnerabilities faster there are a

377
00:13:15,279 --> 00:13:15,839
couple of

378
00:13:15,839 --> 00:13:17,839
interesting things that i want to point

379
00:13:17,839 --> 00:13:19,200
out here the first

380
00:13:19,200 --> 00:13:21,920
is that only about seven percent of the

381
00:13:21,920 --> 00:13:24,079
total population are actually able to

382
00:13:24,079 --> 00:13:26,079
remediate vulnerabilities within

383
00:13:26,079 --> 00:13:28,880
in less than one hour the majority of

384
00:13:28,880 --> 00:13:30,480
the respondents where you can see the

385
00:13:30,480 --> 00:13:32,160
bars go up quite a bit

386
00:13:32,160 --> 00:13:34,000
are able to remediate a critical

387
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:35,440
vulnerability in

388
00:13:35,440 --> 00:13:38,240
less than uh one week but the main

389
00:13:38,240 --> 00:13:38,959
takeaway

390
00:13:38,959 --> 00:13:41,440
for me looking at this chart is that it

391
00:13:41,440 --> 00:13:43,519
is actually very hard

392
00:13:43,519 --> 00:13:45,680
to reduce the time it takes to remediate

393
00:13:45,680 --> 00:13:46,720
vulnerabilities

394
00:13:46,720 --> 00:13:49,199
because there are just so many uh

395
00:13:49,199 --> 00:13:50,800
roadblocks

396
00:13:50,800 --> 00:13:52,399
involved in too many factors too many

397
00:13:52,399 --> 00:13:55,040
stakeholders handoffs approvals etc

398
00:13:55,040 --> 00:13:57,360
so it is really difficult to shrink that

399
00:13:57,360 --> 00:13:58,240
time

400
00:13:58,240 --> 00:14:01,680
however you know the any reduction

401
00:14:01,680 --> 00:14:04,800
is considered to be good because it does

402
00:14:04,800 --> 00:14:06,959
reduce your company's risk for

403
00:14:06,959 --> 00:14:09,600
exposure and so the differences that you

404
00:14:09,600 --> 00:14:10,480
are seeing here

405
00:14:10,480 --> 00:14:12,560
though they aren't as dramatic as we

406
00:14:12,560 --> 00:14:13,760
would like to see

407
00:14:13,760 --> 00:14:17,839
they are statistically significant

408
00:14:18,240 --> 00:14:21,519
okay so if you caught the last talk

409
00:14:21,519 --> 00:14:23,199
jay brought up a really good point about

410
00:14:23,199 --> 00:14:24,800
feature delivery

411
00:14:24,800 --> 00:14:27,040
and at the highest levels of security

412
00:14:27,040 --> 00:14:28,000
integration

413
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:30,639
firms are actually able to prioritize

414
00:14:30,639 --> 00:14:32,000
feature delivery

415
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:33,839
or security improvements over feature

416
00:14:33,839 --> 00:14:35,680
delivery so just

417
00:14:35,680 --> 00:14:38,320
take a minute and imagine that you're

418
00:14:38,320 --> 00:14:40,000
asked to choose between

419
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:42,399
making some sort of security improvement

420
00:14:42,399 --> 00:14:44,639
versus shipping a brand new feature that

421
00:14:44,639 --> 00:14:46,480
your customers have been asking for

422
00:14:46,480 --> 00:14:48,959
and that will help you make your quarter

423
00:14:48,959 --> 00:14:49,920
i think it's

424
00:14:49,920 --> 00:14:52,399
pretty obvious that most businesses

425
00:14:52,399 --> 00:14:54,160
would choose the latter

426
00:14:54,160 --> 00:14:56,320
but we asked a series of questions like

427
00:14:56,320 --> 00:14:58,560
this and we found that firms that have

428
00:14:58,560 --> 00:15:00,880
deeper security integration are actually

429
00:15:00,880 --> 00:15:03,440
more likely to prioritize security

430
00:15:03,440 --> 00:15:04,320
improvements

431
00:15:04,320 --> 00:15:07,440
over future delivery

432
00:15:07,440 --> 00:15:10,240
and additionally they're also able to

433
00:15:10,240 --> 00:15:11,040
stop

434
00:15:11,040 --> 00:15:13,519
a push to production more effectively if

435
00:15:13,519 --> 00:15:14,079
they do

436
00:15:14,079 --> 00:15:17,120
find a critical security vulnerability

437
00:15:17,120 --> 00:15:18,880
so imagine again you're about to push

438
00:15:18,880 --> 00:15:21,199
this new feature the money-making one

439
00:15:21,199 --> 00:15:22,800
to production and you discover a

440
00:15:22,800 --> 00:15:24,240
critical vulnerability

441
00:15:24,240 --> 00:15:26,639
at that point what would you do well

442
00:15:26,639 --> 00:15:27,600
hopefully

443
00:15:27,600 --> 00:15:29,839
most people would stop the train but the

444
00:15:29,839 --> 00:15:31,600
organizations at the highest

445
00:15:31,600 --> 00:15:34,320
level of integration are much more

446
00:15:34,320 --> 00:15:36,000
likely to do that

447
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:38,000
for all types of security issues which i

448
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:41,759
thought was interesting

449
00:15:41,759 --> 00:15:44,560
so so far i've painted a pretty rosy

450
00:15:44,560 --> 00:15:45,839
picture here but

451
00:15:45,839 --> 00:15:49,120
the reality is that security integrating

452
00:15:49,120 --> 00:15:50,000
security

453
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:52,000
into the software delivery life cycle

454
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:54,000
especially when teams are so deeply

455
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:57,120
siloed and processes have

456
00:15:57,120 --> 00:15:59,680
been ingrained for so long it's actually

457
00:15:59,680 --> 00:16:00,880
really messy

458
00:16:00,880 --> 00:16:04,160
especially during the middle stages so

459
00:16:04,160 --> 00:16:05,360
what's happening here

460
00:16:05,360 --> 00:16:07,279
is when you're just starting out you

461
00:16:07,279 --> 00:16:09,519
don't really know what you don't know

462
00:16:09,519 --> 00:16:11,360
and as you start to dig a little bit

463
00:16:11,360 --> 00:16:13,839
deeper for a lot of organizations it

464
00:16:13,839 --> 00:16:15,680
feels like they're opening up pandora's

465
00:16:15,680 --> 00:16:16,320
box

466
00:16:16,320 --> 00:16:18,800
and all like the process the duct tape

467
00:16:18,800 --> 00:16:19,680
the glue

468
00:16:19,680 --> 00:16:22,639
that's been holding all of this together

469
00:16:22,639 --> 00:16:24,639
is suddenly way out in the open

470
00:16:24,639 --> 00:16:26,639
and we've seen this in past reports as

471
00:16:26,639 --> 00:16:28,240
well it's called the j

472
00:16:28,240 --> 00:16:31,040
curve if you imagine like a j or nike

473
00:16:31,040 --> 00:16:31,920
swoosh

474
00:16:31,920 --> 00:16:34,399
and it means that at first things start

475
00:16:34,399 --> 00:16:36,000
out well because you're starting to see

476
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:38,079
some quick wins but then they start to

477
00:16:38,079 --> 00:16:40,079
take a turn for the worse

478
00:16:40,079 --> 00:16:43,360
before they start to get better again

479
00:16:43,360 --> 00:16:45,759
so one of the questions we asked was if

480
00:16:45,759 --> 00:16:47,440
security teams encounter

481
00:16:47,440 --> 00:16:49,759
friction when collaborating with

482
00:16:49,759 --> 00:16:50,880
delivery teams

483
00:16:50,880 --> 00:16:53,040
and as you can see from this chart

484
00:16:53,040 --> 00:16:54,399
friction is higher

485
00:16:54,399 --> 00:16:57,600
in the middle and it never really fully

486
00:16:57,600 --> 00:16:58,720
goes away

487
00:16:58,720 --> 00:17:01,279
um even when the teams are fully

488
00:17:01,279 --> 00:17:02,320
integrated

489
00:17:02,320 --> 00:17:05,039
but when we compare the security rules

490
00:17:05,039 --> 00:17:07,280
versus the non-security rules

491
00:17:07,280 --> 00:17:08,959
it was really interesting that's that

492
00:17:08,959 --> 00:17:10,880
the friction was even higher

493
00:17:10,880 --> 00:17:13,039
for security teams in those middle

494
00:17:13,039 --> 00:17:14,160
stages

495
00:17:14,160 --> 00:17:17,199
and understanding that devops is really

496
00:17:17,199 --> 00:17:18,079
fundamentally

497
00:17:18,079 --> 00:17:20,559
about cultural change it's so important

498
00:17:20,559 --> 00:17:21,599
to remember that

499
00:17:21,599 --> 00:17:23,679
different teams will experience this

500
00:17:23,679 --> 00:17:26,640
change differently

501
00:17:27,839 --> 00:17:30,880
one of the big reasons we hear for not

502
00:17:30,880 --> 00:17:33,200
integrating security is that it'll slow

503
00:17:33,200 --> 00:17:34,080
things down

504
00:17:34,080 --> 00:17:36,559
and again we see here that at level

505
00:17:36,559 --> 00:17:38,000
three

506
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:40,799
people really do feel like security is a

507
00:17:40,799 --> 00:17:41,520
constraint

508
00:17:41,520 --> 00:17:44,480
on delivering their software quicker so

509
00:17:44,480 --> 00:17:44,960
yes

510
00:17:44,960 --> 00:17:47,360
maybe it does slow things down for a bit

511
00:17:47,360 --> 00:17:49,039
because you're trying to figure things

512
00:17:49,039 --> 00:17:51,039
out and trying to build your pipelines

513
00:17:51,039 --> 00:17:52,320
and things like that

514
00:17:52,320 --> 00:17:54,960
but ultimately once you get past that

515
00:17:54,960 --> 00:17:57,360
it's really not any more or less slow

516
00:17:57,360 --> 00:17:58,960
than no integration

517
00:17:58,960 --> 00:18:00,880
and ultimately the outcome should be

518
00:18:00,880 --> 00:18:04,480
better when security is built in

519
00:18:05,600 --> 00:18:08,240
so increasing security integration also

520
00:18:08,240 --> 00:18:10,640
doesn't reduce the number of issues that

521
00:18:10,640 --> 00:18:12,720
require immediate correction that arise

522
00:18:12,720 --> 00:18:13,039
from

523
00:18:13,039 --> 00:18:16,480
audits um the path is again hardest at

524
00:18:16,480 --> 00:18:17,919
levels two and three

525
00:18:17,919 --> 00:18:20,880
but when we look at the number of audits

526
00:18:20,880 --> 00:18:21,760
firms

527
00:18:21,760 --> 00:18:24,000
uh are performing at each of these

528
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:24,880
different levels

529
00:18:24,880 --> 00:18:26,640
it actually turns out that at the very

530
00:18:26,640 --> 00:18:28,400
highest levels

531
00:18:28,400 --> 00:18:30,400
firms are actually doing more audits per

532
00:18:30,400 --> 00:18:31,679
year since oftentimes

533
00:18:31,679 --> 00:18:34,960
audits can be elective and the degree of

534
00:18:34,960 --> 00:18:36,720
difficulty for some audits is also

535
00:18:36,720 --> 00:18:39,280
selective

536
00:18:40,160 --> 00:18:43,520
so to wrap up security integration

537
00:18:43,520 --> 00:18:46,400
into devops practices actually does

538
00:18:46,400 --> 00:18:47,039
result

539
00:18:47,039 --> 00:18:50,160
in better business outcomes and can

540
00:18:50,160 --> 00:18:52,640
transition you away from security

541
00:18:52,640 --> 00:18:53,360
theater

542
00:18:53,360 --> 00:18:55,520
to actually having a stronger security

543
00:18:55,520 --> 00:18:56,640
posture

544
00:18:56,640 --> 00:18:58,640
unfortunately the research also shows

545
00:18:58,640 --> 00:19:00,559
that most organizations are stuck

546
00:19:00,559 --> 00:19:02,799
in the middle so the question is how do

547
00:19:02,799 --> 00:19:04,080
you get unstuck

548
00:19:04,080 --> 00:19:06,320
well there's lots of great details in

549
00:19:06,320 --> 00:19:08,880
the report which you can download online

550
00:19:08,880 --> 00:19:12,240
but to summarize it's about dev security

551
00:19:12,240 --> 00:19:14,799
and ops teams collaborating deeply

552
00:19:14,799 --> 00:19:17,120
from the start and automating across the

553
00:19:17,120 --> 00:19:19,280
entire delivery pipeline

554
00:19:19,280 --> 00:19:21,840
this is a cultural and process change

555
00:19:21,840 --> 00:19:24,240
which can be facilitated with better

556
00:19:24,240 --> 00:19:25,440
tool integration

557
00:19:25,440 --> 00:19:28,000
and collaboration across devsec and ops

558
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:29,360
teams

559
00:19:29,360 --> 00:19:31,039
so i'll leave you with that thank you

560
00:19:31,039 --> 00:19:39,840
very much

561
00:19:40,640 --> 00:19:43,760
and we are so thankful for you

562
00:19:43,760 --> 00:19:47,440
and uh q a won't start in five minutes

563
00:19:47,440 --> 00:19:50,559
q and a will start right now um so

564
00:19:50,559 --> 00:19:52,080
we'll let me just change this little

565
00:19:52,080 --> 00:19:53,919
banner uh so

566
00:19:53,919 --> 00:19:57,360
first let me just say that um

567
00:19:57,360 --> 00:20:00,080
always interesting from hearing about

568
00:20:00,080 --> 00:20:02,480
the um the state of devops report

569
00:20:02,480 --> 00:20:06,320
i think that's a really really huge

570
00:20:06,320 --> 00:20:09,840
huge part of some interesting

571
00:20:09,840 --> 00:20:11,919
data that comes out of our interest our

572
00:20:11,919 --> 00:20:13,120
industry uh

573
00:20:13,120 --> 00:20:16,300
really really really big um

574
00:20:16,300 --> 00:20:18,240
[Music]

575
00:20:18,240 --> 00:20:20,880
so uh first let's uh let's see what's

576
00:20:20,880 --> 00:20:22,400
going on with the questions

577
00:20:22,400 --> 00:20:24,320
all right so far no question so i want

578
00:20:24,320 --> 00:20:25,840
to ask a few more

579
00:20:25,840 --> 00:20:28,799
sure go for it so first of all one of

580
00:20:28,799 --> 00:20:31,200
the cool things that i know about

581
00:20:31,200 --> 00:20:34,240
the way i guess motivated teams are

582
00:20:34,240 --> 00:20:35,600
working now is that they

583
00:20:35,600 --> 00:20:39,039
are really um motivated via

584
00:20:39,039 --> 00:20:41,200
communication

585
00:20:41,200 --> 00:20:43,520
do you feel like that's really uh

586
00:20:43,520 --> 00:20:44,640
reflected enough

587
00:20:44,640 --> 00:20:46,480
in some of the data that's collected

588
00:20:46,480 --> 00:20:48,400
that communication is a real

589
00:20:48,400 --> 00:20:52,080
uh driver of of of this improvement of

590
00:20:52,080 --> 00:20:55,039
teams that adopt devops

591
00:20:55,039 --> 00:20:58,000
um i think traditionally in the systems

592
00:20:58,000 --> 00:20:59,520
world there hasn't been a lot of

593
00:20:59,520 --> 00:21:00,720
communication

594
00:21:00,720 --> 00:21:04,400
outbound um to the other teams because

595
00:21:04,400 --> 00:21:06,159
you know traditionally it has been seen

596
00:21:06,159 --> 00:21:08,159
as a cost center versus a center of

597
00:21:08,159 --> 00:21:08,880
value

598
00:21:08,880 --> 00:21:10,960
but i think that's really changing a lot

599
00:21:10,960 --> 00:21:12,400
and the places that i

600
00:21:12,400 --> 00:21:14,000
see it that are really interesting are

601
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:16,000
things like job descriptions

602
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:18,799
where you know communication skills is

603
00:21:18,799 --> 00:21:20,080
really important

604
00:21:20,080 --> 00:21:23,440
or when i talk to cios or

605
00:21:23,440 --> 00:21:26,080
vps they all want people who can

606
00:21:26,080 --> 00:21:27,679
communicate the value

607
00:21:27,679 --> 00:21:30,080
of the technology versus talking about

608
00:21:30,080 --> 00:21:31,760
the technology itself

609
00:21:31,760 --> 00:21:34,880
so i think there's a real realization

610
00:21:34,880 --> 00:21:36,960
in the industry that communication is

611
00:21:36,960 --> 00:21:38,159
really key

612
00:21:38,159 --> 00:21:40,480
and it's one of the core tenets of

613
00:21:40,480 --> 00:21:42,400
collaboration

614
00:21:42,400 --> 00:21:44,400
thank you that that's a that's a great

615
00:21:44,400 --> 00:21:46,320
thing to hear um

616
00:21:46,320 --> 00:21:49,919
if i've learned anything in working in

617
00:21:49,919 --> 00:21:53,600
uh operations teams especially around

618
00:21:53,600 --> 00:21:56,720
um uh high

619
00:21:56,720 --> 00:22:00,000
you know uh expected

620
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:02,720
uptime um it's it's one of those things

621
00:22:02,720 --> 00:22:03,360
that

622
00:22:03,360 --> 00:22:05,600
if you're not communicating as a team

623
00:22:05,600 --> 00:22:07,200
you're you're not winning

624
00:22:07,200 --> 00:22:10,720
because you're going to um simply just

625
00:22:10,720 --> 00:22:14,080
miss out on on the the important things

626
00:22:14,080 --> 00:22:15,039
that get lost

627
00:22:15,039 --> 00:22:17,679
in the sauce is the only way to describe

628
00:22:17,679 --> 00:22:18,720
it and without

629
00:22:18,720 --> 00:22:21,679
uh teams having great communication

630
00:22:21,679 --> 00:22:22,880
you're simply going to

631
00:22:22,880 --> 00:22:25,520
i think lose out totally agree with that

632
00:22:25,520 --> 00:22:26,400
and you know

633
00:22:26,400 --> 00:22:29,200
we've seen the chat ops movement blow up

634
00:22:29,200 --> 00:22:30,720
over the past couple of years and i

635
00:22:30,720 --> 00:22:32,720
think that's just another indicator

636
00:22:32,720 --> 00:22:34,880
but automating that communication making

637
00:22:34,880 --> 00:22:36,080
it super easy

638
00:22:36,080 --> 00:22:39,600
and um current you know and

639
00:22:39,600 --> 00:22:42,000
uh contextual i think is also important

640
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:43,520
and i think that's why chat ops has

641
00:22:43,520 --> 00:22:45,039
gotten so big

642
00:22:45,039 --> 00:22:47,840
yeah my buddy um my buddy jason hand has

643
00:22:47,840 --> 00:22:50,159
written a lot around that i'm very lucky

644
00:22:50,159 --> 00:22:51,360
that he and i

645
00:22:51,360 --> 00:22:54,559
um have uh traveled the world together

646
00:22:54,559 --> 00:22:56,320
and have talked a lot about

647
00:22:56,320 --> 00:22:59,440
um the benefits of reducing

648
00:22:59,440 --> 00:23:02,240
the amount of minutiae that goes into

649
00:23:02,240 --> 00:23:03,520
executing

650
00:23:03,520 --> 00:23:06,320
something that's very important whether

651
00:23:06,320 --> 00:23:06,880
it's

652
00:23:06,880 --> 00:23:10,640
you know a new deploy or a modification

653
00:23:10,640 --> 00:23:12,400
of an application

654
00:23:12,400 --> 00:23:15,760
chat ops uh responsiveness through

655
00:23:15,760 --> 00:23:19,120
automation i think has really improved

656
00:23:19,120 --> 00:23:22,480
um the lives of people at ops there's no

657
00:23:22,480 --> 00:23:23,760
other way to put it

658
00:23:23,760 --> 00:23:25,919
yeah i think it's a huge uh force

659
00:23:25,919 --> 00:23:27,600
multiplier for a lot of people and it's

660
00:23:27,600 --> 00:23:28,400
contextual

661
00:23:28,400 --> 00:23:32,080
that's the most important thing well

662
00:23:32,080 --> 00:23:34,799
what i want to do is thank you um i

663
