1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,040
hi Susan I'm gonna add you to the stream

2
00:00:02,040 --> 00:00:08,280
so we can Chad now how are you good meet

3
00:00:08,280 --> 00:00:09,150
you finally

4
00:00:09,150 --> 00:00:12,030
yeah it's nice to meet you also as two

5
00:00:12,030 --> 00:00:13,590
people with the same last name within

6
00:00:13,590 --> 00:00:15,360
two hours it's interesting yeah you know

7
00:00:15,360 --> 00:00:21,660
how how fortuitous does that name mean

8
00:00:21,660 --> 00:00:24,029
something cause like I don't know what

9
00:00:24,029 --> 00:00:27,060
that would mean their last name um it

10
00:00:27,060 --> 00:00:28,439
we're brother and sister

11
00:00:28,439 --> 00:00:30,449
and this is the first conference that

12
00:00:30,449 --> 00:00:31,859
we've ever done together so it's sort of

13
00:00:31,859 --> 00:00:35,730
a Wow big milestone that for me anyway

14
00:00:35,730 --> 00:00:39,239
he's done a lot yes so we're super happy

15
00:00:39,239 --> 00:00:44,040
to have you I'm and I guess we can get

16
00:00:44,040 --> 00:00:44,640
started

17
00:00:44,640 --> 00:00:47,550
maybe yeah I'm going you wanna yeah

18
00:00:47,550 --> 00:00:58,680
share your screen um alright so I'm

19
00:00:58,680 --> 00:01:02,430
gonna share it now and so it's my

20
00:01:02,430 --> 00:01:04,920
pleasure to introduce Susan who's gonna

21
00:01:04,920 --> 00:01:07,799
be talking about how did GRC your DevOps

22
00:01:07,799 --> 00:01:13,619
thank you get started sure um so yeah I

23
00:01:13,619 --> 00:01:16,200
gave a talk similar to this at RSA

24
00:01:16,200 --> 00:01:18,210
earlier this year this one's a little

25
00:01:18,210 --> 00:01:20,130
bit shorter and hopefully a little bit

26
00:01:20,130 --> 00:01:23,490
more focused for the audience but like

27
00:01:23,490 --> 00:01:27,479
Sasha said I'm su la la Pomeroy I am the

28
00:01:27,479 --> 00:01:29,280
senior manager for the compliance team

29
00:01:29,280 --> 00:01:33,060
at fastly and I've been doing security

30
00:01:33,060 --> 00:01:37,079
and compliance for over 15 years now and

31
00:01:37,079 --> 00:01:39,150
some people think I'm crazy for that

32
00:01:39,150 --> 00:01:41,850
before that I taught at University and

33
00:01:41,850 --> 00:01:46,100
I'm a published poet so I bring a lot of

34
00:01:46,100 --> 00:01:50,549
different skills I guess to this to this

35
00:01:50,549 --> 00:01:54,060
space so today I want to talk about

36
00:01:54,060 --> 00:01:56,969
DevOps and GRC collaboration but to

37
00:01:56,969 --> 00:01:58,799
understand sort of where I've come from

38
00:01:58,799 --> 00:02:02,090
I want to start with a little story I

39
00:02:02,090 --> 00:02:06,689
left a doc of audit job and entered into

40
00:02:06,689 --> 00:02:08,639
a tech startup and when I did I had a

41
00:02:08,639 --> 00:02:10,619
very lively conversation with an ops

42
00:02:10,619 --> 00:02:12,510
person that I know about change

43
00:02:12,510 --> 00:02:13,650
management and it went

44
00:02:13,650 --> 00:02:16,799
like this I said you can't have change

45
00:02:16,799 --> 00:02:18,209
control that's effective if you don't

46
00:02:18,209 --> 00:02:21,569
have manager approval and a meeting with

47
00:02:21,569 --> 00:02:23,579
all of your stakeholders so they can you

48
00:02:23,579 --> 00:02:25,890
know of course tell you what's wrong to

49
00:02:25,890 --> 00:02:29,549
which he replied what's better is if you

50
00:02:29,549 --> 00:02:32,819
have peer review and automated tests and

51
00:02:32,819 --> 00:02:34,709
I said yeah but all of the frameworks

52
00:02:34,709 --> 00:02:36,239
say that you have to have manager

53
00:02:36,239 --> 00:02:37,890
approval and he said but the managers

54
00:02:37,890 --> 00:02:41,540
aren't really close to the changes that

55
00:02:41,540 --> 00:02:44,430
that you're wanting and it's safer to

56
00:02:44,430 --> 00:02:46,500
have engineers who are closer to that

57
00:02:46,500 --> 00:02:49,109
code to do reviews and to have those

58
00:02:49,109 --> 00:02:51,769
automated tests well we've continued to

59
00:02:51,769 --> 00:02:54,150
have this conversation on and on we

60
00:02:54,150 --> 00:02:56,340
continue to learn from each other to

61
00:02:56,340 --> 00:02:58,950
this day and that's the key that I want

62
00:02:58,950 --> 00:03:02,430
for us today is to stir this

63
00:03:02,430 --> 00:03:06,420
conversation and to continue to have it

64
00:03:06,420 --> 00:03:08,010
between those folks who end up doing

65
00:03:08,010 --> 00:03:10,680
audit and those folks who build the

66
00:03:10,680 --> 00:03:14,129
systems that we are auditing so all of

67
00:03:14,129 --> 00:03:16,230
this started when James Wickett asked

68
00:03:16,230 --> 00:03:17,879
this question on Twitter a little while

69
00:03:17,879 --> 00:03:20,910
ago and I sort of kind of shook my head

70
00:03:20,910 --> 00:03:22,079
because I've been working in tech for a

71
00:03:22,079 --> 00:03:24,470
while I've been sitting next to my

72
00:03:24,470 --> 00:03:26,730
engineering and operations departments

73
00:03:26,730 --> 00:03:28,650
in meetings with them pretty much every

74
00:03:28,650 --> 00:03:30,810
day and I thought everybody was doing

75
00:03:30,810 --> 00:03:34,169
this and it turns out not so much right

76
00:03:34,169 --> 00:03:36,900
gr C's bin next to DevOps through the

77
00:03:36,900 --> 00:03:39,180
past decade of evolution of DevOps

78
00:03:39,180 --> 00:03:43,310
practices but GRC has been very busy

79
00:03:43,310 --> 00:03:46,409
adapting and evolving on their own based

80
00:03:46,409 --> 00:03:49,049
on data breaches and lots of new

81
00:03:49,049 --> 00:03:52,019
legislation and GRC has been sort of

82
00:03:52,019 --> 00:03:54,560
more reactive instead of being able to

83
00:03:54,560 --> 00:03:58,889
look at and evolve with the positive

84
00:03:58,889 --> 00:04:00,629
change that DevOps has brought to the

85
00:04:00,629 --> 00:04:04,799
industry so this short version of what

86
00:04:04,799 --> 00:04:06,659
I'm here to tell you today is that

87
00:04:06,659 --> 00:04:09,329
DevOps and GRC collaboration is going to

88
00:04:09,329 --> 00:04:12,030
make audits smoother for your auditors

89
00:04:12,030 --> 00:04:14,459
and your engineers and everybody will

90
00:04:14,459 --> 00:04:16,649
end up happier in the end I want to

91
00:04:16,649 --> 00:04:18,120
challenge any auditors in the audience

92
00:04:18,120 --> 00:04:21,269
to think about how they're viewing those

93
00:04:21,269 --> 00:04:23,669
traditional controls and that we have to

94
00:04:23,669 --> 00:04:25,560
change those views and we should change

95
00:04:25,560 --> 00:04:27,060
those views

96
00:04:27,060 --> 00:04:28,650
but the key that I really want us to get

97
00:04:28,650 --> 00:04:30,900
a come away with is that when we

98
00:04:30,900 --> 00:04:33,660
calibrate how things work between our

99
00:04:33,660 --> 00:04:36,120
ops and our dev and our security and our

100
00:04:36,120 --> 00:04:39,810
audit organizations that is going to be

101
00:04:39,810 --> 00:04:44,210
the foundation of more resilient systems

102
00:04:44,210 --> 00:04:46,919
so let's start with why I think security

103
00:04:46,919 --> 00:04:49,200
frameworks are your friends they're

104
00:04:49,200 --> 00:04:52,620
built on very sound security measures

105
00:04:52,620 --> 00:04:54,870
and tenets that everybody wants and

106
00:04:54,870 --> 00:04:57,780
they're meant to be and they're written

107
00:04:57,780 --> 00:05:00,360
to be flexible to your business based on

108
00:05:00,360 --> 00:05:03,750
the risk profile of what you do for your

109
00:05:03,750 --> 00:05:06,240
business they're also there they also

110
00:05:06,240 --> 00:05:07,710
enable engineering teams to get what

111
00:05:07,710 --> 00:05:10,080
they want which is visibility and

112
00:05:10,080 --> 00:05:12,360
tooling that they need to do their jobs

113
00:05:12,360 --> 00:05:15,360
better security frameworks also give

114
00:05:15,360 --> 00:05:19,350
your business the reason to put in the

115
00:05:19,350 --> 00:05:21,360
security programs that you want to do

116
00:05:21,360 --> 00:05:24,630
anyway as you know security usually cost

117
00:05:24,630 --> 00:05:27,150
a lot of money so having a framework

118
00:05:27,150 --> 00:05:28,979
that you're audited against sort of

119
00:05:28,979 --> 00:05:30,590
gives you that reason

120
00:05:30,590 --> 00:05:33,030
however framers have also been

121
00:05:33,030 --> 00:05:36,330
advertently been very unclear on how to

122
00:05:36,330 --> 00:05:40,760
implement the very sort of nonspecific

123
00:05:40,760 --> 00:05:43,320
requirements that that they have and and

124
00:05:43,320 --> 00:05:45,900
if they're implemented in a way that's

125
00:05:45,900 --> 00:05:48,300
super complex or in a way that's at a

126
00:05:48,300 --> 00:05:50,430
risk level that's maybe higher than what

127
00:05:50,430 --> 00:05:52,110
the business needs that has the

128
00:05:52,110 --> 00:05:54,150
capability to create some some serious

129
00:05:54,150 --> 00:05:56,400
business slowdowns security frameworks

130
00:05:56,400 --> 00:05:58,530
can also be interpreted as being super

131
00:05:58,530 --> 00:06:01,500
rigid and when you implement a lot of

132
00:06:01,500 --> 00:06:05,520
rigidity in those controls it makes

133
00:06:05,520 --> 00:06:07,410
folks do things in a way that's contrary

134
00:06:07,410 --> 00:06:09,300
to the way that they would work

135
00:06:09,300 --> 00:06:11,820
naturally I want Anna caveat here some

136
00:06:11,820 --> 00:06:13,890
security controls have rigidity to them

137
00:06:13,890 --> 00:06:15,780
so this is an entirely misplaced and

138
00:06:15,780 --> 00:06:18,210
then security frameworks also make a

139
00:06:18,210 --> 00:06:21,000
whole lot of paperwork and as a as an

140
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:24,419
auditor I this is very true and this is

141
00:06:24,419 --> 00:06:26,850
the part of my job that I hate I think

142
00:06:26,850 --> 00:06:28,289
everybody remembers what cab meetings

143
00:06:28,289 --> 00:06:32,280
were like right so let's get down to the

144
00:06:32,280 --> 00:06:35,340
basics of what we want auditors we want

145
00:06:35,340 --> 00:06:37,470
something super simple we want effective

146
00:06:37,470 --> 00:06:39,190
security controls that can

147
00:06:39,190 --> 00:06:42,300
evidence and that are repeatable and

148
00:06:42,300 --> 00:06:45,310
engineers well they want stable systems

149
00:06:45,310 --> 00:06:47,380
and when the systems aren't stable they

150
00:06:47,380 --> 00:06:48,970
want to be able to improve and respond

151
00:06:48,970 --> 00:06:51,460
to super quickly they also want to have

152
00:06:51,460 --> 00:06:53,500
a common systems understanding across

153
00:06:53,500 --> 00:06:56,500
all of their teams across engineering

154
00:06:56,500 --> 00:06:58,990
and operations and they want to have as

155
00:06:58,990 --> 00:07:00,750
much visibility into the systems as

156
00:07:00,750 --> 00:07:02,950
possible so that they can see how

157
00:07:02,950 --> 00:07:06,310
they're operating your security teams

158
00:07:06,310 --> 00:07:08,830
want well they want secure enough

159
00:07:08,830 --> 00:07:13,120
systems they want a tested code that

160
00:07:13,120 --> 00:07:15,340
includes testing to the OIC top ten they

161
00:07:15,340 --> 00:07:19,000
want visibility to unusual activity but

162
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:20,580
they want to be able to define that

163
00:07:20,580 --> 00:07:22,600
specifically so they're not woken up at

164
00:07:22,600 --> 00:07:24,730
2:00 a.m. when someone's pseudos into

165
00:07:24,730 --> 00:07:28,000
production and they want rule-following

166
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:31,630
with systems and with people so that

167
00:07:31,630 --> 00:07:34,060
when somebody does sudo into a box at

168
00:07:34,060 --> 00:07:36,340
2:00 a.m. because of an incident or an

169
00:07:36,340 --> 00:07:38,950
outage they're not necessarily broken up

170
00:07:38,950 --> 00:07:40,750
because that might be that's considered

171
00:07:40,750 --> 00:07:44,230
maybe normal behavior this list of what

172
00:07:44,230 --> 00:07:46,780
we want for all of these different

173
00:07:46,780 --> 00:07:49,560
organizations isn't a full list of

174
00:07:49,560 --> 00:07:51,490
everything that we want but it does

175
00:07:51,490 --> 00:07:55,000
highlight some areas of similarity we

176
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:57,310
all want resiliency we all like

177
00:07:57,310 --> 00:07:59,560
visibility and an ability to respond

178
00:07:59,560 --> 00:08:02,470
quickly and we all want quality in the

179
00:08:02,470 --> 00:08:04,990
systems that we run but how we want it

180
00:08:04,990 --> 00:08:10,840
is super different engineers don't care

181
00:08:10,840 --> 00:08:13,660
that they can evidence that they've done

182
00:08:13,660 --> 00:08:15,400
their job they just want to be able to

183
00:08:15,400 --> 00:08:17,740
do their jobs and auditors don't care

184
00:08:17,740 --> 00:08:19,870
how fast we fix things or do things we

185
00:08:19,870 --> 00:08:21,850
just want them to be super methodical

186
00:08:21,850 --> 00:08:27,220
and documented remember perfect is often

187
00:08:27,220 --> 00:08:28,870
the enemy of good enough except for when

188
00:08:28,870 --> 00:08:31,150
you have to explain an exception on your

189
00:08:31,150 --> 00:08:33,370
sock to report to your customers and

190
00:08:33,370 --> 00:08:37,510
your executive leadership the key here

191
00:08:37,510 --> 00:08:38,979
is that we all want to make our jobs

192
00:08:38,979 --> 00:08:43,330
easier and our goals are to force our

193
00:08:43,330 --> 00:08:45,490
methods so when I say our I mean

194
00:08:45,490 --> 00:08:47,980
auditors and engineers and security

195
00:08:47,980 --> 00:08:51,910
folks we don't want to impose the way we

196
00:08:51,910 --> 00:08:52,870
think on other

197
00:08:52,870 --> 00:08:55,320
the business our goal is to calibrate

198
00:08:55,320 --> 00:08:57,760
with the other areas of the business so

199
00:08:57,760 --> 00:08:59,620
that our common goals right we're all

200
00:08:59,620 --> 00:09:02,260
working toward the same business goals

201
00:09:02,260 --> 00:09:04,480
which includes risk reduction we want to

202
00:09:04,480 --> 00:09:06,190
be able to reach those and that's really

203
00:09:06,190 --> 00:09:09,160
the goal of any compliance framework in

204
00:09:09,160 --> 00:09:11,770
order to do that though we have to start

205
00:09:11,770 --> 00:09:14,500
minimizing the gap between work is

206
00:09:14,500 --> 00:09:17,010
imagined which is how security controls

207
00:09:17,010 --> 00:09:20,710
and frameworks are designed and work is

208
00:09:20,710 --> 00:09:22,600
done which is how security is actually

209
00:09:22,600 --> 00:09:26,170
accomplished so where we position

210
00:09:26,170 --> 00:09:28,330
ourselves within these mental models of

211
00:09:28,330 --> 00:09:30,700
how things work is going to be the key

212
00:09:30,700 --> 00:09:34,480
to how we get the DevOps principles in

213
00:09:34,480 --> 00:09:37,540
the GRC principles calibrated and

214
00:09:37,540 --> 00:09:40,510
aligned if you haven't read the

215
00:09:40,510 --> 00:09:42,310
varieties of human work by Stephen Shrek

216
00:09:42,310 --> 00:09:44,500
and I've put a link here please go do so

217
00:09:44,500 --> 00:09:49,540
this is it's super seminal and and I'm

218
00:09:49,540 --> 00:09:51,610
mostly going to focus on work as

219
00:09:51,610 --> 00:09:55,110
imagined and work as done today so

220
00:09:55,110 --> 00:09:58,420
workers imagined starts with how we

221
00:09:58,420 --> 00:10:01,900
design frameworks and controls it's

222
00:10:01,900 --> 00:10:03,910
usually starts with in a perfect world I

223
00:10:03,910 --> 00:10:08,730
would do something this way and then we

224
00:10:08,730 --> 00:10:12,100
draw a process flow diagram and we write

225
00:10:12,100 --> 00:10:14,170
a wiki page on how to do this and then

226
00:10:14,170 --> 00:10:15,940
as auditors were like this is great

227
00:10:15,940 --> 00:10:20,070
it'll work all the time this way right

228
00:10:20,070 --> 00:10:23,080
unfortunately the way work is actually

229
00:10:23,080 --> 00:10:26,380
done is like this it's super messy we

230
00:10:26,380 --> 00:10:29,050
may start with a process flow and a

231
00:10:29,050 --> 00:10:32,290
process document and then an operator

232
00:10:32,290 --> 00:10:35,890
will start seeing some getting some

233
00:10:35,890 --> 00:10:38,050
other indicators or getting additional

234
00:10:38,050 --> 00:10:40,540
information and then they'll start

235
00:10:40,540 --> 00:10:42,550
deviating from that process in order to

236
00:10:42,550 --> 00:10:43,600
meet their goals

237
00:10:43,600 --> 00:10:46,570
remember it's visibility into the system

238
00:10:46,570 --> 00:10:48,850
it's keeping the system's stable it's

239
00:10:48,850 --> 00:10:51,640
understanding what's going on in the

240
00:10:51,640 --> 00:10:54,610
system and those things meeting those

241
00:10:54,610 --> 00:10:56,650
goals may or may not actually follow

242
00:10:56,650 --> 00:11:00,930
procedure so you all may remember in

243
00:11:00,930 --> 00:11:05,860
2009 when Captain Sullenberger landed

244
00:11:05,860 --> 00:11:08,470
sorry US Airways flight 1549 in the

245
00:11:08,470 --> 00:11:11,230
Hudson after two bird strikes this is a

246
00:11:11,230 --> 00:11:13,570
prime example that I always like to use

247
00:11:13,570 --> 00:11:16,240
about an operator using their expertise

248
00:11:16,240 --> 00:11:18,790
in their adaptive capacity to keep a

249
00:11:18,790 --> 00:11:20,860
system safe in this case the system was

250
00:11:20,860 --> 00:11:24,070
the aircraft and the passengers and crew

251
00:11:24,070 --> 00:11:27,130
on board this isn't something you can

252
00:11:27,130 --> 00:11:29,890
write into a procedure right how this

253
00:11:29,890 --> 00:11:32,890
crew was able to land this plane and and

254
00:11:32,890 --> 00:11:37,870
not have any any fatalities is testament

255
00:11:37,870 --> 00:11:40,060
to their adaptive capacity it's not

256
00:11:40,060 --> 00:11:42,730
something that we should react to like

257
00:11:42,730 --> 00:11:45,280
we have with certain data breaches etc

258
00:11:45,280 --> 00:11:50,430
and adapt it into a framework either

259
00:11:50,430 --> 00:11:53,080
Sydney Decker says procedures are an

260
00:11:53,080 --> 00:11:55,800
investment in safety but not always

261
00:11:55,800 --> 00:11:58,330
procedures are thought to be required to

262
00:11:58,330 --> 00:12:00,400
achieve safe practice yet they are not

263
00:12:00,400 --> 00:12:03,250
always necessary nor likely ever

264
00:12:03,250 --> 00:12:05,650
sufficient for creating safety and

265
00:12:05,650 --> 00:12:07,930
that's the key here nor likely ever

266
00:12:07,930 --> 00:12:11,650
sufficient for creating safety but we

267
00:12:11,650 --> 00:12:14,020
seem to want as auditors is for

268
00:12:14,020 --> 00:12:16,240
processes to be performed accurately and

269
00:12:16,240 --> 00:12:19,150
consistently all the time but that's

270
00:12:19,150 --> 00:12:23,800
antithetical to keeping a system safe if

271
00:12:23,800 --> 00:12:25,630
the question is dealing with whether you

272
00:12:25,630 --> 00:12:27,550
have an exception on an audit report or

273
00:12:27,550 --> 00:12:30,490
you have an extended outage that's going

274
00:12:30,490 --> 00:12:32,410
to affect your customers in your Avenue

275
00:12:32,410 --> 00:12:34,240
I promise you procedures and controls

276
00:12:34,240 --> 00:12:36,070
are going to change because reality is

277
00:12:36,070 --> 00:12:41,830
always going to trump procedure so when

278
00:12:41,830 --> 00:12:44,410
you're designing a security control or

279
00:12:44,410 --> 00:12:48,280
process ask yourselves and by yourselves

280
00:12:48,280 --> 00:12:50,590
I mean auditors and engineers what is

281
00:12:50,590 --> 00:12:54,220
the risk you're trying to mitigate what

282
00:12:54,220 --> 00:12:56,170
are the goals for this process or

283
00:12:56,170 --> 00:12:59,200
control I promise you what's in your

284
00:12:59,200 --> 00:13:01,270
head as an auditor isn't the same thing

285
00:13:01,270 --> 00:13:03,160
that's in the head of yourself as an

286
00:13:03,160 --> 00:13:06,460
engineer and is also different from

287
00:13:06,460 --> 00:13:08,530
what's in the head of your product

288
00:13:08,530 --> 00:13:11,340
manager and your security engineer so

289
00:13:11,340 --> 00:13:15,490
once you explicitly answer this question

290
00:13:15,490 --> 00:13:17,620
across those across those boundaries

291
00:13:17,620 --> 00:13:18,730
you're going to start a

292
00:13:18,730 --> 00:13:20,380
Publishing that common ground you need

293
00:13:20,380 --> 00:13:22,750
to reach the same goal which is that

294
00:13:22,750 --> 00:13:24,550
risk reduction and more resilient

295
00:13:24,550 --> 00:13:27,610
systems so these are the two things

296
00:13:27,610 --> 00:13:29,350
we're talking about reasonable assurance

297
00:13:29,350 --> 00:13:31,720
that a control is in place and timely

298
00:13:31,720 --> 00:13:34,420
detection when that control can't be in

299
00:13:34,420 --> 00:13:37,209
place now reasonable and timely our

300
00:13:37,209 --> 00:13:40,240
normative terms so you're going to want

301
00:13:40,240 --> 00:13:41,920
to define this because what's reasonable

302
00:13:41,920 --> 00:13:43,750
for one company is not going to be

303
00:13:43,750 --> 00:13:46,060
reasonable for another and what's timely

304
00:13:46,060 --> 00:13:47,800
for one security control isn't going to

305
00:13:47,800 --> 00:13:53,079
be timely for another either back in the

306
00:13:53,079 --> 00:13:55,839
day when I started in security the cloud

307
00:13:55,839 --> 00:13:57,760
was a super scary place and no one

308
00:13:57,760 --> 00:13:59,320
wanted to go there especially the

309
00:13:59,320 --> 00:14:02,050
government and so this was one of the

310
00:14:02,050 --> 00:14:03,730
funny things people would post on their

311
00:14:03,730 --> 00:14:05,470
cubicle walls right the best security

312
00:14:05,470 --> 00:14:08,649
control is the is the one that keeps us

313
00:14:08,649 --> 00:14:11,079
disconnected right especially from the

314
00:14:11,079 --> 00:14:14,320
cloud so reasonable assurance isn't

315
00:14:14,320 --> 00:14:16,389
looking for a control that works a

316
00:14:16,389 --> 00:14:19,060
hundred percent of the time but we do

317
00:14:19,060 --> 00:14:23,470
want to know when things go wrong I love

318
00:14:23,470 --> 00:14:25,120
this tweet by Jessica divita who's

319
00:14:25,120 --> 00:14:28,180
speaking later today the safest aircraft

320
00:14:28,180 --> 00:14:30,550
never flies the safest anesthesia is

321
00:14:30,550 --> 00:14:33,190
never given all operators and risky

322
00:14:33,190 --> 00:14:35,470
domains must find and adjust the balance

323
00:14:35,470 --> 00:14:37,480
between acute faster better cheaper

324
00:14:37,480 --> 00:14:41,010
goals and chronic goals such as safety

325
00:14:41,010 --> 00:14:43,690
this is where we as auditors have to

326
00:14:43,690 --> 00:14:46,420
realize the adaptive capacity of our

327
00:14:46,420 --> 00:14:48,610
engineers are one of the best security

328
00:14:48,610 --> 00:14:53,019
controls that we can have in place so

329
00:14:53,019 --> 00:14:54,459
let's talk about one of my favorite

330
00:14:54,459 --> 00:14:57,399
security controls and my favorite I

331
00:14:57,399 --> 00:14:59,769
don't mean favourite separation of

332
00:14:59,769 --> 00:15:02,230
duties so according to nest separation

333
00:15:02,230 --> 00:15:04,089
of duties addresses the potential for

334
00:15:04,089 --> 00:15:06,550
abuse of authorized privileges and helps

335
00:15:06,550 --> 00:15:08,319
reduce the risk of malevolent activity

336
00:15:08,319 --> 00:15:09,970
without collusion sort of the key there

337
00:15:09,970 --> 00:15:13,720
is without collusion this can this

338
00:15:13,720 --> 00:15:17,560
control typically has been used in terms

339
00:15:17,560 --> 00:15:19,660
of financial systems and fraud right you

340
00:15:19,660 --> 00:15:21,670
don't want the person who requested the

341
00:15:21,670 --> 00:15:24,190
check to process the check or sign that

342
00:15:24,190 --> 00:15:26,010
check but it doesn't really all

343
00:15:26,010 --> 00:15:29,709
translate that well into our IT systems

344
00:15:29,709 --> 00:15:32,050
which we have traditionally translated

345
00:15:32,050 --> 00:15:32,680
it

346
00:15:32,680 --> 00:15:36,370
- so in the past we've seen this

347
00:15:36,370 --> 00:15:38,290
cardinal rule right of Deb's write the

348
00:15:38,290 --> 00:15:40,779
code and Ops deploys and maintains the

349
00:15:40,779 --> 00:15:43,149
code in it you know the past decade has

350
00:15:43,149 --> 00:15:44,770
shown us that it hasn't worked so well

351
00:15:44,770 --> 00:15:46,960
in DevOps has worked really hard to sort

352
00:15:46,960 --> 00:15:49,600
of change that paradigm and yet GRC

353
00:15:49,600 --> 00:15:51,910
still insists on imposing this as a

354
00:15:51,910 --> 00:15:55,149
security control so what's happened is

355
00:15:55,149 --> 00:15:58,480
we while trying to implement this

356
00:15:58,480 --> 00:15:59,980
security controller separation of duties

357
00:15:59,980 --> 00:16:02,380
were enabling and enforcing more risk on

358
00:16:02,380 --> 00:16:07,029
our systems so the problem has always

359
00:16:07,029 --> 00:16:09,430
been that separation of duties is

360
00:16:09,430 --> 00:16:11,620
assumed to require multiple humans as

361
00:16:11,620 --> 00:16:14,680
primary operators of different functions

362
00:16:14,680 --> 00:16:17,980
and this causes this conflict between

363
00:16:17,980 --> 00:16:20,380
audit and engineering right one reduces

364
00:16:20,380 --> 00:16:24,240
risk and the other ends up reducing

365
00:16:24,240 --> 00:16:26,920
productivity right it's a slowdown and a

366
00:16:26,920 --> 00:16:30,630
risk potentially two systems resiliency

367
00:16:30,630 --> 00:16:33,370
so there's a whole lot of complexity

368
00:16:33,370 --> 00:16:35,470
that's associated with separation of

369
00:16:35,470 --> 00:16:38,260
duties and oftentimes we don't end up

370
00:16:38,260 --> 00:16:41,339
telling each other the stories that we

371
00:16:41,339 --> 00:16:43,720
the stories of what we need out of that

372
00:16:43,720 --> 00:16:46,810
work so you may have an engineer who's

373
00:16:46,810 --> 00:16:49,029
who's saying in an outage I have to be

374
00:16:49,029 --> 00:16:50,709
able to fix the system without a whole

375
00:16:50,709 --> 00:16:52,300
lot of people I have to be able to be

376
00:16:52,300 --> 00:16:54,580
fast this is important for the business

377
00:16:54,580 --> 00:16:57,940
is important for my goals and then you

378
00:16:57,940 --> 00:16:59,860
know your internal audit team is saying

379
00:16:59,860 --> 00:17:01,420
but we have to have separate people to

380
00:17:01,420 --> 00:17:02,770
develop and deploy because the

381
00:17:02,770 --> 00:17:07,059
regulations say so your product people

382
00:17:07,059 --> 00:17:08,650
are saying but if we can't move quickly

383
00:17:08,650 --> 00:17:10,569
we can't beat our competition to solve

384
00:17:10,569 --> 00:17:13,150
that customer problem then the meantime

385
00:17:13,150 --> 00:17:14,619
your CEO is sort of stuck in the middle

386
00:17:14,619 --> 00:17:16,449
right if we get a finding on our audit

387
00:17:16,449 --> 00:17:17,800
we'll lose the trust of our customers

388
00:17:17,800 --> 00:17:20,170
but if the systems are down we're going

389
00:17:20,170 --> 00:17:24,130
to lose that to a couple of other

390
00:17:24,130 --> 00:17:26,380
challenges that we see related to

391
00:17:26,380 --> 00:17:28,540
separation of duties is when a control

392
00:17:28,540 --> 00:17:32,890
or process activity is written for its

393
00:17:32,890 --> 00:17:35,740
process for process sake right and

394
00:17:35,740 --> 00:17:37,630
Decker refers to the systems as

395
00:17:37,630 --> 00:17:40,360
malicious compliance that means that if

396
00:17:40,360 --> 00:17:42,880
when you're following a process to the

397
00:17:42,880 --> 00:17:44,919
letter it removes that capability to

398
00:17:44,919 --> 00:17:45,850
adapt it

399
00:17:45,850 --> 00:17:48,360
really causes more of it to your systems

400
00:17:48,360 --> 00:17:51,429
it reduces the capability to adapt to

401
00:17:51,429 --> 00:17:53,890
situations that the process wasn't even

402
00:17:53,890 --> 00:17:56,289
designed to cover and it couldn't even

403
00:17:56,289 --> 00:17:57,610
consider it because they because they

404
00:17:57,610 --> 00:17:59,470
didn't know when they were developing

405
00:17:59,470 --> 00:18:02,799
that process to begin with close behind

406
00:18:02,799 --> 00:18:05,260
that is the idea of checkbox compliance

407
00:18:05,260 --> 00:18:09,039
which is when you've got controls that

408
00:18:09,039 --> 00:18:10,720
are in place and procedures that are in

409
00:18:10,720 --> 00:18:12,580
place and the only benefit that they

410
00:18:12,580 --> 00:18:15,400
give to the business is that you pass an

411
00:18:15,400 --> 00:18:17,350
audit is that it's it's only for past

412
00:18:17,350 --> 00:18:19,780
well it's only for audit eventually

413
00:18:19,780 --> 00:18:21,880
you're going to have situations where

414
00:18:21,880 --> 00:18:25,030
the reasons and the context behind why

415
00:18:25,030 --> 00:18:27,700
you do that thing is completely lost and

416
00:18:27,700 --> 00:18:31,380
when that is lost and that sort of

417
00:18:31,380 --> 00:18:34,150
communal knowledge isn't passed on from

418
00:18:34,150 --> 00:18:36,190
one team or one engineer to another that

419
00:18:36,190 --> 00:18:39,070
thing that seems meaningless just

420
00:18:39,070 --> 00:18:40,990
doesn't happen anymore and that will

421
00:18:40,990 --> 00:18:43,470
cause some visibility issues and

422
00:18:43,470 --> 00:18:46,900
additional risk right both of these

423
00:18:46,900 --> 00:18:50,620
equal hire business risk so ask

424
00:18:50,620 --> 00:18:52,240
yourselves when you're trying to

425
00:18:52,240 --> 00:18:56,860
implement separation of duties what is

426
00:18:56,860 --> 00:18:58,059
the risk that you're trying to mitigate

427
00:18:58,059 --> 00:19:02,620
is it fraud is it authorized access for

428
00:19:02,620 --> 00:19:04,780
unauthorized activities are you trying

429
00:19:04,780 --> 00:19:07,360
to sort of mitigate that insider threat

430
00:19:07,360 --> 00:19:10,929
how how likely is that insider threat

431
00:19:10,929 --> 00:19:12,220
considering everything else that you

432
00:19:12,220 --> 00:19:15,309
have in place you're never going to have

433
00:19:15,309 --> 00:19:17,380
the same answer especially depending on

434
00:19:17,380 --> 00:19:18,850
what you're applying separation of

435
00:19:18,850 --> 00:19:22,090
duties to but you want to dig in and ask

436
00:19:22,090 --> 00:19:23,919
those specific questions what systems

437
00:19:23,919 --> 00:19:27,730
what data what teams what business

438
00:19:27,730 --> 00:19:31,240
drivers are the security control trying

439
00:19:31,240 --> 00:19:35,140
to answer for it may be financial risk

440
00:19:35,140 --> 00:19:37,650
it may be availability risk sometimes

441
00:19:37,650 --> 00:19:40,450
human separation is really the answer

442
00:19:40,450 --> 00:19:42,880
and I've you know sort of but grudgingly

443
00:19:42,880 --> 00:19:45,789
you know accepted this over the past few

444
00:19:45,789 --> 00:19:49,240
years but it's not always the only

445
00:19:49,240 --> 00:19:54,130
answer so how can we be okay with

446
00:19:54,130 --> 00:19:56,650
engineers deploying their own code I I

447
00:19:56,650 --> 00:19:58,240
get this question a lot from other

448
00:19:58,240 --> 00:19:59,559
auditors who seem

449
00:19:59,559 --> 00:20:02,080
really scared about allowing engineers

450
00:20:02,080 --> 00:20:03,669
to deploy their own code well first we

451
00:20:03,669 --> 00:20:06,370
trust engineers use their expertise to

452
00:20:06,370 --> 00:20:08,409
adapt right there we actually have

453
00:20:08,409 --> 00:20:10,210
controls in all of our security

454
00:20:10,210 --> 00:20:12,429
frameworks for this we ask for

455
00:20:12,429 --> 00:20:14,529
background checks we ask for performance

456
00:20:14,529 --> 00:20:16,330
reviews we want to make sure that though

457
00:20:16,330 --> 00:20:18,570
that folks with the right qualifications

458
00:20:18,570 --> 00:20:22,320
are hired to do this work that is

459
00:20:22,320 --> 00:20:24,610
allowing folks to use their expertise to

460
00:20:24,610 --> 00:20:27,220
adapt the other thing that we can do is

461
00:20:27,220 --> 00:20:28,960
make sure that we have a safe and

462
00:20:28,960 --> 00:20:31,749
transparent environment so that when a

463
00:20:31,749 --> 00:20:34,659
procedure has to be deviated from in

464
00:20:34,659 --> 00:20:37,600
order to meet those goals folks can come

465
00:20:37,600 --> 00:20:40,090
forward and talk about those deviations

466
00:20:40,090 --> 00:20:42,549
in order to change those processes to

467
00:20:42,549 --> 00:20:45,269
become more efficient but more efficient

468
00:20:45,269 --> 00:20:47,919
the psychological safety is super

469
00:20:47,919 --> 00:20:50,440
important because otherwise you won't

470
00:20:50,440 --> 00:20:54,460
know when folks have deviated from a

471
00:20:54,460 --> 00:20:58,360
particular process and again that causes

472
00:20:58,360 --> 00:21:01,299
more risk this is putting in place some

473
00:21:01,299 --> 00:21:06,399
guardrails for folks not speed bumps but

474
00:21:06,399 --> 00:21:12,610
you can't audit trust right so so we do

475
00:21:12,610 --> 00:21:15,070
have ways in which we can make sure that

476
00:21:15,070 --> 00:21:18,639
we verify that things are okay for audit

477
00:21:18,639 --> 00:21:20,379
we can do that through transparency

478
00:21:20,379 --> 00:21:22,809
right we have lots of logs we have lots

479
00:21:22,809 --> 00:21:24,610
of evidence and artifacts and we have

480
00:21:24,610 --> 00:21:28,389
visibility into how this how our DevOps

481
00:21:28,389 --> 00:21:31,090
practices work we can also make sure

482
00:21:31,090 --> 00:21:33,879
that we understand as auditors our tools

483
00:21:33,879 --> 00:21:36,429
and our our people involved in these

484
00:21:36,429 --> 00:21:39,549
processes so we can utilize the CI city

485
00:21:39,549 --> 00:21:41,379
pipeline for deployments right and

486
00:21:41,379 --> 00:21:43,629
thereby have lots of logs to show

487
00:21:43,629 --> 00:21:46,690
exactly what happened we can also make

488
00:21:46,690 --> 00:21:50,379
sure that we put in place the knowledge

489
00:21:50,379 --> 00:21:52,929
share of people and tools doing code

490
00:21:52,929 --> 00:21:55,570
review we can also invite our security

491
00:21:55,570 --> 00:21:57,159
friends to make sure that they're in on

492
00:21:57,159 --> 00:22:00,519
the story by reviewing anomalies sharing

493
00:22:00,519 --> 00:22:02,470
that information with our engineering

494
00:22:02,470 --> 00:22:06,899
and ops departments and audit as well

495
00:22:06,899 --> 00:22:13,330
and so how do we get there we get here

496
00:22:13,330 --> 00:22:15,940
by having effective communication and I

497
00:22:15,940 --> 00:22:17,560
know that sometimes communication can be

498
00:22:17,560 --> 00:22:20,530
super difficult your compliance team or

499
00:22:20,530 --> 00:22:23,410
internal audit may sit it makes it under

500
00:22:23,410 --> 00:22:25,330
your finance team or your law team

501
00:22:25,330 --> 00:22:27,610
sometimes compliance sits within the

502
00:22:27,610 --> 00:22:29,800
security team which is nice sometimes

503
00:22:29,800 --> 00:22:32,110
security sits under engineering and so

504
00:22:32,110 --> 00:22:34,690
there aren't that those silos is to

505
00:22:34,690 --> 00:22:36,070
create sometimes you have an internal

506
00:22:36,070 --> 00:22:38,230
tools team sometimes you're small enough

507
00:22:38,230 --> 00:22:42,910
you don't have a tool like that so we

508
00:22:42,910 --> 00:22:45,550
want to make sure that we try to break

509
00:22:45,550 --> 00:22:47,680
down these silos and I'm going to talk

510
00:22:47,680 --> 00:22:49,180
about a couple of ways that we can do

511
00:22:49,180 --> 00:22:52,270
that so yeah communication is hard

512
00:22:52,270 --> 00:22:55,090
typically some of the challenges that we

513
00:22:55,090 --> 00:22:57,010
have are when information is shared it's

514
00:22:57,010 --> 00:23:00,010
shared among a sort of managerial level

515
00:23:00,010 --> 00:23:04,180
and it doesn't filter down the same way

516
00:23:04,180 --> 00:23:06,070
depending on who that manager is right

517
00:23:06,070 --> 00:23:09,010
that horrible game of telephone we also

518
00:23:09,010 --> 00:23:12,550
have worked for audits is usually

519
00:23:12,550 --> 00:23:15,550
requested in haste during an audit very

520
00:23:15,550 --> 00:23:16,930
short audit timeframe and it's without

521
00:23:16,930 --> 00:23:18,520
context please give me that screen

522
00:23:18,520 --> 00:23:20,680
capture from that config tool and

523
00:23:20,680 --> 00:23:23,080
because I need it for the external

524
00:23:23,080 --> 00:23:24,760
auditors but that engineer probably

525
00:23:24,760 --> 00:23:27,670
hasn't done that in a year if it's even

526
00:23:27,670 --> 00:23:29,050
the same engineer who did it for you

527
00:23:29,050 --> 00:23:31,360
last year the other challenge that we

528
00:23:31,360 --> 00:23:34,270
have is a time right we're all busy at a

529
00:23:34,270 --> 00:23:37,150
hundred percent or 110 percent doing the

530
00:23:37,150 --> 00:23:40,300
job that we're there to do so how can I

531
00:23:40,300 --> 00:23:42,370
make more time to meet with folks of

532
00:23:42,370 --> 00:23:44,050
these other organizations that I maybe

533
00:23:44,050 --> 00:23:48,100
have an idea of what they're going to

534
00:23:48,100 --> 00:23:52,000
ask me to do right so I beg of you make

535
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:54,490
friends with your compliance teams and

536
00:23:54,490 --> 00:23:56,790
do this by not inviting them out for

537
00:23:56,790 --> 00:23:58,960
beverages but invite them to your

538
00:23:58,960 --> 00:24:01,150
meetings put them on your engineering

539
00:24:01,150 --> 00:24:04,870
distribution lists this way they learn

540
00:24:04,870 --> 00:24:07,030
and understand more about how you work

541
00:24:07,030 --> 00:24:10,620
which makes them more empathetic to

542
00:24:10,620 --> 00:24:12,820
designing those security controls and

543
00:24:12,820 --> 00:24:14,920
processes to match how you work right

544
00:24:14,920 --> 00:24:17,170
and hey auditors make sure you go to

545
00:24:17,170 --> 00:24:19,150
those read those emails go to those

546
00:24:19,150 --> 00:24:21,730
all-hands meetings and talk to folks in

547
00:24:21,730 --> 00:24:24,280
those organizations the next thing is we

548
00:24:24,280 --> 00:24:26,260
want to establish common ground right so

549
00:24:26,260 --> 00:24:26,950
what

550
00:24:26,950 --> 00:24:28,300
Engineers know about your security

551
00:24:28,300 --> 00:24:31,000
controls and frameworks sometimes it's

552
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:32,650
only what you've you know what they've

553
00:24:32,650 --> 00:24:35,230
gleaned from those audit requests

554
00:24:35,230 --> 00:24:37,480
what do auditors know about the systems

555
00:24:37,480 --> 00:24:39,340
and engineering and tools that your

556
00:24:39,340 --> 00:24:41,680
business supports make sure that you as

557
00:24:41,680 --> 00:24:43,360
an auditor know what your tech stack

558
00:24:43,360 --> 00:24:45,820
looks like you don't have to code it you

559
00:24:45,820 --> 00:24:48,310
just have to know it and ask each other

560
00:24:48,310 --> 00:24:50,170
what's going to make your job easier and

561
00:24:50,170 --> 00:24:53,140
this way we can design those processes

562
00:24:53,140 --> 00:24:55,900
better the other thing that you can do

563
00:24:55,900 --> 00:24:58,240
is establish workable internal checks so

564
00:24:58,240 --> 00:25:01,420
this means and monthly or quarterly

565
00:25:01,420 --> 00:25:04,390
recurring activities make sure that you

566
00:25:04,390 --> 00:25:06,700
work together when those when those are

567
00:25:06,700 --> 00:25:15,880
there so so that you can oh so sorry so

568
00:25:15,880 --> 00:25:19,060
that you can find ways that those

569
00:25:19,060 --> 00:25:21,520
processes are maybe not working so well

570
00:25:21,520 --> 00:25:23,890
for folks but the key with this one is

571
00:25:23,890 --> 00:25:25,420
make sure that psychological safety is

572
00:25:25,420 --> 00:25:26,770
there internal checks aren't to get

573
00:25:26,770 --> 00:25:29,200
people in trouble they are to help

574
00:25:29,200 --> 00:25:32,770
improve those processes if you have an

575
00:25:32,770 --> 00:25:34,600
infrastructure product manager make sure

576
00:25:34,600 --> 00:25:35,830
they're in your audit planning meetings

577
00:25:35,830 --> 00:25:37,060
because they're going to be able to take

578
00:25:37,060 --> 00:25:39,430
a whole lot of information back to your

579
00:25:39,430 --> 00:25:43,240
organization and share your controls

580
00:25:43,240 --> 00:25:45,820
matrix with engineering publicize it if

581
00:25:45,820 --> 00:25:47,530
you get a lot of questions about it it

582
00:25:47,530 --> 00:25:49,390
means they don't know a lot about it and

583
00:25:49,390 --> 00:25:51,340
you have got some work to do right and

584
00:25:51,340 --> 00:25:52,810
then go to product meetings the best

585
00:25:52,810 --> 00:25:55,960
thing you can do is understand what's in

586
00:25:55,960 --> 00:25:57,910
the planning process so that you can

587
00:25:57,910 --> 00:26:00,250
feed those security controls in at the

588
00:26:00,250 --> 00:26:03,400
front end of your development so I'll

589
00:26:03,400 --> 00:26:06,180
leave you with this systems break

590
00:26:06,180 --> 00:26:09,100
processes are deviated from this is

591
00:26:09,100 --> 00:26:13,480
normal work what we have to understand

592
00:26:13,480 --> 00:26:15,850
and rely on is that people's ability to

593
00:26:15,850 --> 00:26:18,640
adapt to adverse situations is going to

594
00:26:18,640 --> 00:26:20,920
be the strongest security control that

595
00:26:20,920 --> 00:26:25,500
we can have I have a lot of references

596
00:26:25,500 --> 00:26:27,550
at the end I will make these slides

597
00:26:27,550 --> 00:26:31,450
available online and I'm happy to talk

598
00:26:31,450 --> 00:26:35,400
about any questions that you have

599
00:26:35,610 --> 00:26:38,190
so we're we don't have a lot of

600
00:26:38,190 --> 00:26:40,410
questions coming in right now but we you

601
00:26:40,410 --> 00:26:42,270
have a couple comments saying that

602
00:26:42,270 --> 00:26:45,090
people love this talk well thank you I

603
00:26:45,090 --> 00:26:48,210
will say so for now I want to ask about

604
00:26:48,210 --> 00:26:51,510
my own question so I've seen like I've

605
00:26:51,510 --> 00:26:53,429
seen organizations where people just

606
00:26:53,429 --> 00:26:55,380
don't trust each other and so there's a

607
00:26:55,380 --> 00:26:58,230
lot of this like okay I can't let my you

608
00:26:58,230 --> 00:27:00,540
know engineers push to production and my

609
00:27:00,540 --> 00:27:02,429
usual answer is like you you hire these

610
00:27:02,429 --> 00:27:04,470
people like what why would you hire them

611
00:27:04,470 --> 00:27:06,210
if you don't trust them right but

612
00:27:06,210 --> 00:27:09,390
there's also like the non-biological

613
00:27:09,390 --> 00:27:12,059
state where people are required by some

614
00:27:12,059 --> 00:27:14,540
type of government regulation to follow

615
00:27:14,540 --> 00:27:16,770
procedures that don't make sense anymore

616
00:27:16,770 --> 00:27:19,860
like how do you how to get over that um

617
00:27:19,860 --> 00:27:24,900
so typically the way that I've addressed

618
00:27:24,900 --> 00:27:28,440
this is to ask typically our security

619
00:27:28,440 --> 00:27:30,840
frameworks to say they don't say how you

620
00:27:30,840 --> 00:27:32,520
do something they say that you have to

621
00:27:32,520 --> 00:27:36,720
do a thing to achieve an end right some

622
00:27:36,720 --> 00:27:38,220
of them again are pretty prescriptive

623
00:27:38,220 --> 00:27:42,000
but you know you can you can have

624
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:43,650
separation of duties with machines and

625
00:27:43,650 --> 00:27:46,980
not people and so you know DevOps is

626
00:27:46,980 --> 00:27:48,900
sort of built on some of that automation

627
00:27:48,900 --> 00:27:51,870
and stuff and so the more visibility you

628
00:27:51,870 --> 00:27:53,360
give to auditors the better they feel

629
00:27:53,360 --> 00:27:56,250
about the security controls that they

630
00:27:56,250 --> 00:27:59,250
think are supposed to be in place and so

631
00:27:59,250 --> 00:28:02,480
I it's kind of like I changed my mind

632
00:28:02,480 --> 00:28:05,640
moment right and so I've had long

633
00:28:05,640 --> 00:28:07,559
conversations with external auditors to

634
00:28:07,559 --> 00:28:10,380
kind of show them we've remembered

635
00:28:10,380 --> 00:28:12,090
what's the risk that we're trying to

636
00:28:12,090 --> 00:28:13,950
mitigate why are you asking me to have

637
00:28:13,950 --> 00:28:16,590
this thing in place if we've reduced the

638
00:28:16,590 --> 00:28:19,730
risk that this thing was intended to

639
00:28:19,730 --> 00:28:22,410
mitigate I want to show you that we've

640
00:28:22,410 --> 00:28:24,540
mitigated it it may not be the way that

641
00:28:24,540 --> 00:28:26,100
you thought that I should mitigate it

642
00:28:26,100 --> 00:28:29,730
but we've mitigated it so another

643
00:28:29,730 --> 00:28:32,429
question great talk um any

644
00:28:32,429 --> 00:28:34,890
recommendations for the first steps on

645
00:28:34,890 --> 00:28:38,850
this path to follow lots and lots of

646
00:28:38,850 --> 00:28:42,600
talking and lots of listening so I think

647
00:28:42,600 --> 00:28:44,460
that the best thing that ever happens to

648
00:28:44,460 --> 00:28:48,030
me was to make a lot of friends and

649
00:28:48,030 --> 00:28:49,040
listen a

650
00:28:49,040 --> 00:28:51,770
in to our operations group who told me

651
00:28:51,770 --> 00:28:57,590
how our platform worked and so just as

652
00:28:57,590 --> 00:29:00,320
an audit if I'm if if the person who's

653
00:29:00,320 --> 00:29:02,270
asking the question is an auditor go to

654
00:29:02,270 --> 00:29:04,850
your engine areas and just listen to

655
00:29:04,850 --> 00:29:07,190
understand how what is their day like

656
00:29:07,190 --> 00:29:10,520
how do they do their jobs right and if

657
00:29:10,520 --> 00:29:12,500
you are an engineer or like really go

658
00:29:12,500 --> 00:29:16,550
ask your auditor folks how what how do

659
00:29:16,550 --> 00:29:19,340
you do this job every day what is this

660
00:29:19,340 --> 00:29:22,220
you know why are you asking me to do

661
00:29:22,220 --> 00:29:24,620
this right and and have those just

662
00:29:24,620 --> 00:29:26,720
honest conversations they're not a lot

663
00:29:26,720 --> 00:29:28,490
of the challenges that we have are that

664
00:29:28,490 --> 00:29:31,900
people bring assumptions right about

665
00:29:31,900 --> 00:29:34,610
like you said about trust right I don't

666
00:29:34,610 --> 00:29:36,140
trust auditors to know what I should be

667
00:29:36,140 --> 00:29:36,620
doing

668
00:29:36,620 --> 00:29:38,420
I don't trust engineers to do the right

669
00:29:38,420 --> 00:29:41,030
thing I mean if we if we start with a

670
00:29:41,030 --> 00:29:46,190
basis of of trust and develop that sort

671
00:29:46,190 --> 00:29:47,900
of that common ground right that

672
00:29:47,900 --> 00:29:50,570
understanding then we're gonna come a

673
00:29:50,570 --> 00:29:54,650
lot closer I so another question that

674
00:29:54,650 --> 00:29:56,510
you kind of like saying to what you just

675
00:29:56,510 --> 00:29:59,210
said um do you think auditors and

676
00:29:59,210 --> 00:30:01,970
security should be members of the to

677
00:30:01,970 --> 00:30:05,690
pizza team um so I have had the

678
00:30:05,690 --> 00:30:08,300
privilege to work with as on as a

679
00:30:08,300 --> 00:30:10,480
compliance person within a security team

680
00:30:10,480 --> 00:30:14,450
and I have had the privilege of working

681
00:30:14,450 --> 00:30:17,660
on a compliance team that does not

682
00:30:17,660 --> 00:30:20,600
report in directly have direct reporting

683
00:30:20,600 --> 00:30:22,670
structure into the security team I

684
00:30:22,670 --> 00:30:26,150
absolutely do you think that it's very

685
00:30:26,150 --> 00:30:28,370
effective it's more effective to be sort

686
00:30:28,370 --> 00:30:29,840
of embedded in that security team I know

687
00:30:29,840 --> 00:30:31,220
some folks think that there's a

688
00:30:31,220 --> 00:30:32,810
separation of duties issue and

689
00:30:32,810 --> 00:30:34,910
especially with some frameworks that's

690
00:30:34,910 --> 00:30:37,550
absolutely true so it's really going to

691
00:30:37,550 --> 00:30:40,820
depend on what the need is of your

692
00:30:40,820 --> 00:30:45,440
business but there is the question if

693
00:30:45,440 --> 00:30:47,990
you and John got along growing up and

694
00:30:47,990 --> 00:30:50,090
also a request for you to finish with a

695
00:30:50,090 --> 00:30:56,990
poem oh my goodness yes we we got along

696
00:30:56,990 --> 00:30:59,180
some day you can ask him about his

697
00:30:59,180 --> 00:31:02,720
breakdancing capabilities and

698
00:31:02,720 --> 00:31:05,390
short Wow I wasn't actually prepared for

699
00:31:05,390 --> 00:31:09,500
this but sure uh do we have we have one

700
00:31:09,500 --> 00:31:13,940
minute okay how does this appropriate to

701
00:31:13,940 --> 00:31:17,090
read on that so this is a poem called

702
00:31:17,090 --> 00:31:20,630
swallowing Antarctica it's a sonnet when

703
00:31:20,630 --> 00:31:23,260
we round the bend in Charlotte's Bay

704
00:31:23,260 --> 00:31:26,000
when the bough breaks through ice like

705
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:29,000
sugar candy in a child's hand when light

706
00:31:29,000 --> 00:31:30,950
breaks over snow-capped mountains like a

707
00:31:30,950 --> 00:31:33,730
heaven or a miracle I prefer this side

708
00:31:33,730 --> 00:31:34,970
starboard

709
00:31:34,970 --> 00:31:37,250
where the Sun licks first and where if I

710
00:31:37,250 --> 00:31:39,620
were to jump I would not be missed for

711
00:31:39,620 --> 00:31:43,400
hours and if I were to jump catch an ice

712
00:31:43,400 --> 00:31:45,740
floe and right at North or sink into

713
00:31:45,740 --> 00:31:47,809
that sky where penguins fly I would

714
00:31:47,809 --> 00:31:50,990
swallow all Antarctic relics men and

715
00:31:50,990 --> 00:31:53,929
science alike embody ancient ice and

716
00:31:53,929 --> 00:31:56,570
waters teeming with life caught in

717
00:31:56,570 --> 00:31:59,809
evolution and frozen a blueprint a map

718
00:31:59,809 --> 00:32:04,039
on which to chart a course Wow it's

719
00:32:04,039 --> 00:32:06,919
beautiful and thank you so much this is

720
