10
00:00:19,890 --> 00:00:21,029
the pone school

okay can you see my slides okay okay so

15
00:00:56,879 --> 00:00:59,820
welcome everyone to my talk it's titled

16
00:00:59,820 --> 00:01:01,320
the pen tester blueprint a guide to

17
00:01:01,320 --> 00:01:06,810
becoming a pen tester to kind of tell

18
00:01:06,810 --> 00:01:11,580
you a little bit about myself I work as

19
00:01:11,580 --> 00:01:16,200
a red teamer for a large global consumer

20
00:01:16,200 --> 00:01:18,600
product company I am also the adjunct

21
00:01:18,600 --> 00:01:20,549
professor at Richland College I teach

22
00:01:20,549 --> 00:01:22,799
web application hack web application pin

23
00:01:22,799 --> 00:01:25,409
testing as well as ethical hacking I'm

24
00:01:25,409 --> 00:01:26,880
the founder of the pone school project

25
00:01:26,880 --> 00:01:30,619
which is a monthly meetup based on

26
00:01:30,619 --> 00:01:33,150
topics of cybersecurity and ethical

27
00:01:33,150 --> 00:01:36,030
hacking I've been an IT and InfoSec for

28
00:01:36,030 --> 00:01:39,270
a little over 22 years I got my start as

29
00:01:39,270 --> 00:01:42,210
a system administrator spent the past 16

30
00:01:42,210 --> 00:01:44,909
years in security and app sec and then

31
00:01:44,909 --> 00:01:47,880
eight years the past eight years as a

32
00:01:47,880 --> 00:01:50,549
pen tester five years of consulting and

33
00:01:50,549 --> 00:01:53,130
I'm also a co-host of the uncommon

34
00:01:53,130 --> 00:01:55,590
journey podcast with Chloe Muskogee and

35
00:01:55,590 --> 00:01:58,920
Alyssa Miller I'd like to share this

36
00:01:58,920 --> 00:02:00,420
slide to let people know about my

37
00:02:00,420 --> 00:02:03,719
background because you know you can do

38
00:02:03,719 --> 00:02:04,829
anything you want to if you put your

39
00:02:04,829 --> 00:02:06,390
mind to it if you learn I thought I

40
00:02:06,390 --> 00:02:08,550
never thought I'd ever used my mind for

41
00:02:08,550 --> 00:02:10,830
a living back in my younger days because

42
00:02:10,830 --> 00:02:11,720
of my is a

43
00:02:11,720 --> 00:02:14,090
strengths and so I started out as a pro

44
00:02:14,090 --> 00:02:16,550
wrestler moved into CAD draftsman and

45
00:02:16,550 --> 00:02:18,890
then sysadmin InfoSec and then in

46
00:02:18,890 --> 00:02:20,860
depending

47
00:02:20,860 --> 00:02:25,040
so this talk evolved out of a talk that

48
00:02:25,040 --> 00:02:28,850
I do at the first first-class school for

49
00:02:28,850 --> 00:02:32,030
each of my classes to share with

50
00:02:32,030 --> 00:02:33,800
students that you only hack if you have

51
00:02:33,800 --> 00:02:36,140
permission otherwise it's illegal so I

52
00:02:36,140 --> 00:02:38,360
like this quote that I like to share

53
00:02:38,360 --> 00:02:39,830
with students it kind of keeps that in

54
00:02:39,830 --> 00:02:41,750
your mind with great power comes great

55
00:02:41,750 --> 00:02:43,700
responsibility

56
00:02:43,700 --> 00:02:45,680
so always make sure you have permission

57
00:02:45,680 --> 00:02:50,330
and even better yet make sure that you

58
00:02:50,330 --> 00:02:52,390
have a written permission

59
00:02:52,390 --> 00:02:55,600
what is pen testing its pen testing is

60
00:02:55,600 --> 00:02:58,310
you know often you heard referred to as

61
00:02:58,310 --> 00:03:00,050
ethical hacking so you're actually

62
00:03:00,050 --> 00:03:02,450
assessing security from an adversarial

63
00:03:02,450 --> 00:03:08,930
perspective so you go in and see what

64
00:03:08,930 --> 00:03:13,160
you can see if you can actually exploit

65
00:03:13,160 --> 00:03:14,570
the vulnerabilities you find and that

66
00:03:14,570 --> 00:03:18,010
just kind of gives you more of a idea of

67
00:03:18,010 --> 00:03:21,800
the the risk level if it's exploitable

68
00:03:21,800 --> 00:03:23,810
then it's a higher risk and more of a

69
00:03:23,810 --> 00:03:26,180
justification to budget to fix the

70
00:03:26,180 --> 00:03:27,860
vulnerability sometimes vulnerabilities

71
00:03:27,860 --> 00:03:30,769
are kind of expensive and the companies

72
00:03:30,769 --> 00:03:33,440
may not have the budget to fix it and so

73
00:03:33,440 --> 00:03:35,690
you have to weigh the risk so pen

74
00:03:35,690 --> 00:03:37,400
testing is a way to justify those

75
00:03:37,400 --> 00:03:41,360
vulnerabilities being remediated some of

76
00:03:41,360 --> 00:03:43,280
the reasons for pen testing a big driver

77
00:03:43,280 --> 00:03:45,140
for a lot of companies is regulatory

78
00:03:45,140 --> 00:03:46,070
compliance

79
00:03:46,070 --> 00:03:48,950
payment card industry is a big one it's

80
00:03:48,950 --> 00:03:50,239
a fun job and there's a lot of

81
00:03:50,239 --> 00:03:52,010
opportunities pen testing has been

82
00:03:52,010 --> 00:03:53,930
around for a while but when I was

83
00:03:53,930 --> 00:03:55,459
getting getting started back eight years

84
00:03:55,459 --> 00:03:58,010
ago most of the pen testers were

85
00:03:58,010 --> 00:04:00,470
consultants or contractors and so a lot

86
00:04:00,470 --> 00:04:01,760
of companies are starting to hire more

87
00:04:01,760 --> 00:04:04,670
of their internal pen testers it's rare

88
00:04:04,670 --> 00:04:06,260
nowadays that you see companies that

89
00:04:06,260 --> 00:04:07,459
don't have pen testers so there's an

90
00:04:07,459 --> 00:04:09,739
opportunity as people ramp up and build

91
00:04:09,739 --> 00:04:13,150
their offensive security departments

92
00:04:13,360 --> 00:04:14,830
different pen tested when you're looking

93
00:04:14,830 --> 00:04:16,120
for a job some of the things that keep

94
00:04:16,120 --> 00:04:17,920
in mind is the professional term is

95
00:04:17,920 --> 00:04:19,540
penetration tester or pen tester for

96
00:04:19,540 --> 00:04:22,000
short you may see ethical hacking in

97
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:24,190
there security consultants analysts and

98
00:04:24,190 --> 00:04:25,660
engineers you just have to look at those

99
00:04:25,660 --> 00:04:28,210
job descriptions looking for keywords

100
00:04:28,210 --> 00:04:30,040
related to pen testing or some of the

101
00:04:30,040 --> 00:04:33,400
pen testing tools other synonymous terms

102
00:04:33,400 --> 00:04:36,010
with pen testing ethical hacking

103
00:04:36,010 --> 00:04:38,590
offensive security adversarial security

104
00:04:38,590 --> 00:04:40,120
threat and vulnerability management is

105
00:04:40,120 --> 00:04:42,150
one of the departments that usually

106
00:04:42,150 --> 00:04:47,590
employs pen testers skills use in other

107
00:04:47,590 --> 00:04:50,230
areas so it's very helpful for sock

108
00:04:50,230 --> 00:04:52,810
engineers digital forensics Incident

109
00:04:52,810 --> 00:04:54,460
Response network security analyst

110
00:04:54,460 --> 00:04:56,530
engineers purple teams where you're

111
00:04:56,530 --> 00:04:58,750
actually working together with the red

112
00:04:58,750 --> 00:05:00,520
team the pen testers to improve the

113
00:05:00,520 --> 00:05:02,650
defenses and applications security

114
00:05:02,650 --> 00:05:04,750
applications security is an area where

115
00:05:04,750 --> 00:05:07,240
pen testing is widely used and you'll

116
00:05:07,240 --> 00:05:10,330
see a lot of times your bug hunters come

117
00:05:10,330 --> 00:05:12,160
from a webapp pen testing background or

118
00:05:12,160 --> 00:05:14,830
a development background different types

119
00:05:14,830 --> 00:05:16,060
of targets so when you're doing your

120
00:05:16,060 --> 00:05:17,710
tests you'll be testing different

121
00:05:17,710 --> 00:05:19,390
targets and here of us - some of the

122
00:05:19,390 --> 00:05:22,410
targets and that works applications

123
00:05:22,410 --> 00:05:25,990
hardware transportation people as in

124
00:05:25,990 --> 00:05:27,280
social engineering in the building

125
00:05:27,280 --> 00:05:30,310
buildings for physical security and the

126
00:05:30,310 --> 00:05:32,050
vehicles are becoming more popular a

127
00:05:32,050 --> 00:05:34,300
more common area that needs to be tested

128
00:05:34,300 --> 00:05:38,100
because with the the autonomous vehicles

129
00:05:38,100 --> 00:05:40,570
coming you want to make sure that this

130
00:05:40,570 --> 00:05:43,530
vehicles are saved and not weaponized

131
00:05:43,530 --> 00:05:46,630
and types of knowledge of your target is

132
00:05:46,630 --> 00:05:48,490
you know if you have limited knowledge

133
00:05:48,490 --> 00:05:51,940
of the target maybe just IP address then

134
00:05:51,940 --> 00:05:54,430
it's a black box limited information so

135
00:05:54,430 --> 00:05:57,160
it's more simulating what a real-world

136
00:05:57,160 --> 00:05:59,979
attacker would would be viewing the

137
00:05:59,979 --> 00:06:03,490
application or target as and white box

138
00:06:03,490 --> 00:06:05,740
also known as Crystal boxes detailed

139
00:06:05,740 --> 00:06:08,800
system info accounts web app pentesting

140
00:06:08,800 --> 00:06:10,810
this is a good way to test because

141
00:06:10,810 --> 00:06:11,919
you're able to test what an

142
00:06:11,919 --> 00:06:14,380
authenticated user can do so sometimes

143
00:06:14,380 --> 00:06:15,640
the more information you have the more

144
00:06:15,640 --> 00:06:18,160
thorough you can test the target and the

145
00:06:18,160 --> 00:06:20,380
most common type of pen test is usually

146
00:06:20,380 --> 00:06:22,419
gray box because this partial knowledge

147
00:06:22,419 --> 00:06:25,210
not as in-depth as white box but gives

148
00:06:25,210 --> 00:06:26,950
you a lot more information in black box

149
00:06:26,950 --> 00:06:28,540
okay a lot of times it's a time

150
00:06:28,540 --> 00:06:31,090
sensitive the pen tests and so you don't

151
00:06:31,090 --> 00:06:32,920
have a lot of time to go through and do

152
00:06:32,920 --> 00:06:34,810
all the extensive recon that a

153
00:06:34,810 --> 00:06:37,870
real-world or malicious actor would do

154
00:06:37,870 --> 00:06:40,810
so you need some information and all

155
00:06:40,810 --> 00:06:42,430
this is based on the amount of time you

156
00:06:42,430 --> 00:06:45,760
have for the test different types of

157
00:06:45,760 --> 00:06:48,490
testing in the testing depth kind of one

158
00:06:48,490 --> 00:06:50,050
of the some of the starting areas is the

159
00:06:50,050 --> 00:06:51,400
pen testing and these all kind of build

160
00:06:51,400 --> 00:06:52,630
on each other is your vulnerability

161
00:06:52,630 --> 00:06:54,820
scans running your necess cams or your

162
00:06:54,820 --> 00:06:56,800
next post scans define the

163
00:06:56,800 --> 00:06:58,390
vulnerabilities and typically there's

164
00:06:58,390 --> 00:07:00,690
groups within companies that perform

165
00:07:00,690 --> 00:07:02,920
vulnerability scanning this is not a pen

166
00:07:02,920 --> 00:07:04,450
test this is just like one of the first

167
00:07:04,450 --> 00:07:07,120
steps in a pen test and then the next

168
00:07:07,120 --> 00:07:08,650
level of depth is vulnerability

169
00:07:08,650 --> 00:07:10,090
assessments this is where you go through

170
00:07:10,090 --> 00:07:11,830
you do your vulnerability scanning and

171
00:07:11,830 --> 00:07:13,840
you validate the vulnerabilities and

172
00:07:13,840 --> 00:07:16,210
make sure they're not false positives so

173
00:07:16,210 --> 00:07:17,590
you check that so that way you're going

174
00:07:17,590 --> 00:07:19,060
to step above the vulnerability scan

175
00:07:19,060 --> 00:07:20,680
vulnerability scans there could be false

176
00:07:20,680 --> 00:07:22,480
positives with the vulnerability

177
00:07:22,480 --> 00:07:24,730
assessment you're trying to rule out the

178
00:07:24,730 --> 00:07:26,740
false positives and only identifying the

179
00:07:26,740 --> 00:07:29,140
actual vulnerabilities we get the pen

180
00:07:29,140 --> 00:07:30,490
testing we're taking that one step

181
00:07:30,490 --> 00:07:32,770
further we're taking those two steps we

182
00:07:32,770 --> 00:07:35,230
validated that vulnerability so next

183
00:07:35,230 --> 00:07:36,610
thing we're doing is we're going to see

184
00:07:36,610 --> 00:07:38,110
if we can exploit that see if we can

185
00:07:38,110 --> 00:07:40,900
hack in to those vulnerabilities now

186
00:07:40,900 --> 00:07:43,090
then you get into adversarial testing or

187
00:07:43,090 --> 00:07:45,340
red teaming and sometimes generically

188
00:07:45,340 --> 00:07:48,070
you hear Red Team Blue Team Blue Team

189
00:07:48,070 --> 00:07:49,390
four for defense

190
00:07:49,390 --> 00:07:51,490
red team for offense but in the true

191
00:07:51,490 --> 00:07:53,380
professional term red teaming is more

192
00:07:53,380 --> 00:07:56,140
adversarial simulation so this you're

193
00:07:56,140 --> 00:07:57,880
testing the blue team you're testing the

194
00:07:57,880 --> 00:08:03,400
response time the technology and the

195
00:08:03,400 --> 00:08:06,820
just testing the defenses in general so

196
00:08:06,820 --> 00:08:12,310
it's usually a less restrictive scope in

197
00:08:12,310 --> 00:08:14,020
different specializations most people

198
00:08:14,020 --> 00:08:15,970
will start out as a generalist unless

199
00:08:15,970 --> 00:08:18,640
you have a background application so

200
00:08:18,640 --> 00:08:20,520
typically someone that's assist admin

201
00:08:20,520 --> 00:08:23,020
has a sysadmin background will start out

202
00:08:23,020 --> 00:08:25,960
as a is a generalist in someone with a

203
00:08:25,960 --> 00:08:27,400
web application development background

204
00:08:27,400 --> 00:08:30,970
may start out is in application pen

205
00:08:30,970 --> 00:08:33,909
testing social engineering is this big

206
00:08:33,909 --> 00:08:35,679
specialization there's some people such

207
00:08:35,679 --> 00:08:38,380
as Jason Street that specializes in

208
00:08:38,380 --> 00:08:39,900
social engineering

209
00:08:39,900 --> 00:08:42,870
and physical security testing the

210
00:08:42,870 --> 00:08:45,030
security of the buildings so you also

211
00:08:45,030 --> 00:08:47,070
have transportation people that are

212
00:08:47,070 --> 00:08:49,950
specialized in vehicles and then Red

213
00:08:49,950 --> 00:08:51,390
Team as we mentioned adversarial

214
00:08:51,390 --> 00:08:54,240
simulation some people mainly do the

215
00:08:54,240 --> 00:08:55,980
adversarial simulation and this will

216
00:08:55,980 --> 00:08:58,590
combine your social engineering and your

217
00:08:58,590 --> 00:09:00,840
physical pen testing along with some of

218
00:09:00,840 --> 00:09:02,930
the other pen testing and hacking skills

219
00:09:02,930 --> 00:09:07,140
and how to become a pen tester so when

220
00:09:07,140 --> 00:09:08,370
you become a pen tester in part the

221
00:09:08,370 --> 00:09:09,840
reason I like to share my background

222
00:09:09,840 --> 00:09:11,580
with people let them see where I started

223
00:09:11,580 --> 00:09:14,280
is you have to understand your targets

224
00:09:14,280 --> 00:09:17,850
you have to understand the technology so

225
00:09:17,850 --> 00:09:19,080
you have to understand networking

226
00:09:19,080 --> 00:09:23,190
operating systems security applications

227
00:09:23,190 --> 00:09:24,450
and hardware you have to understand that

228
00:09:24,450 --> 00:09:26,400
technology before you can secure it or

229
00:09:26,400 --> 00:09:29,160
even break into it because if you get a

230
00:09:29,160 --> 00:09:33,120
shell to a system a windows box and you

231
00:09:33,120 --> 00:09:34,080
don't know the Windows command line

232
00:09:34,080 --> 00:09:35,280
you're gonna be doing a lot of googling

233
00:09:35,280 --> 00:09:36,390
or it's going to take you a long time

234
00:09:36,390 --> 00:09:37,470
with pen tests so you need this

235
00:09:37,470 --> 00:09:41,250
knowledge going into it and how to

236
00:09:41,250 --> 00:09:43,680
become a pen tester so after you have

237
00:09:43,680 --> 00:09:45,690
the technology knowledge you need the

238
00:09:45,690 --> 00:09:47,040
hacking knowledge and you can get this

239
00:09:47,040 --> 00:09:51,060
through classes conferences meetups and

240
00:09:51,060 --> 00:09:53,550
you can also self studies a good way to

241
00:09:53,550 --> 00:09:56,730
learn most cases that's people are

242
00:09:56,730 --> 00:09:57,960
funding this out of their own pocket

243
00:09:57,960 --> 00:09:59,250
unless their company's paying for it so

244
00:09:59,250 --> 00:10:02,130
home labs videos you can find on YouTube

245
00:10:02,130 --> 00:10:03,630
there's a lot of good streams out there

246
00:10:03,630 --> 00:10:06,330
in YouTube channels different tutorials

247
00:10:06,330 --> 00:10:09,840
online blog blogs and articles as well

248
00:10:09,840 --> 00:10:12,470
as Twitter Twitter's one my go-to

249
00:10:12,470 --> 00:10:15,030
resources for security information a lot

250
00:10:15,030 --> 00:10:17,790
of exploits are posted there and a lot

251
00:10:17,790 --> 00:10:20,580
of good researchers and pen testers red

252
00:10:20,580 --> 00:10:22,830
teamers and such are out there and post

253
00:10:22,830 --> 00:10:23,940
their information so it's a good place

254
00:10:23,940 --> 00:10:28,230
to learn and kind of continued on that

255
00:10:28,230 --> 00:10:31,290
topic and what you have the skills you

256
00:10:31,290 --> 00:10:33,180
you once you've got you know you're

257
00:10:33,180 --> 00:10:34,680
learning you have the technology skills

258
00:10:34,680 --> 00:10:37,110
down security you need to develop that

259
00:10:37,110 --> 00:10:38,760
hacker mindset and this is the ability

260
00:10:38,760 --> 00:10:41,610
to think like a hacker to be able

261
00:10:41,610 --> 00:10:43,290
exploit vulnerabilities the hacker

262
00:10:43,290 --> 00:10:47,100
mindset is a combination of creative and

263
00:10:47,100 --> 00:10:48,960
analytical thinking it's one of the

264
00:10:48,960 --> 00:10:51,330
areas of security cybersecurity that

265
00:10:51,330 --> 00:10:53,699
requires a lot of creativity

266
00:10:53,699 --> 00:10:55,199
you learn the different vulnerabilities

267
00:10:55,199 --> 00:10:56,699
and exploits and how to chain those

268
00:10:56,699 --> 00:10:59,609
gather in ways you can exploit things in

269
00:10:59,609 --> 00:11:02,489
the true more meaning of the hacker term

270
00:11:02,489 --> 00:11:04,709
where hackers originally people that

271
00:11:04,709 --> 00:11:07,439
were experimenters they work with

272
00:11:07,439 --> 00:11:10,079
different technologies and tried to

273
00:11:10,079 --> 00:11:11,669
enhance technologies and do things that

274
00:11:11,669 --> 00:11:13,410
it wasn't equipped to do or even build

275
00:11:13,410 --> 00:11:16,529
technology and so this is where you kind

276
00:11:16,529 --> 00:11:19,049
of get the creativity use the creativity

277
00:11:19,049 --> 00:11:22,049
as such of the original hackers and the

278
00:11:22,049 --> 00:11:23,999
hacker mindset takes time and repetition

279
00:11:23,999 --> 00:11:26,040
to develop and it's best developed with

280
00:11:26,040 --> 00:11:29,999
hands-on hacking experience so the pen

281
00:11:29,999 --> 00:11:32,429
tester blueprint formula is kind of

282
00:11:32,429 --> 00:11:34,470
common a high level you're combining the

283
00:11:34,470 --> 00:11:36,269
technology knowledge security knowledge

284
00:11:36,269 --> 00:11:38,579
in the hacker mindset these three areas

285
00:11:38,579 --> 00:11:40,559
you need to know to be successful in

286
00:11:40,559 --> 00:11:44,249
becoming a pen tester and where do you

287
00:11:44,249 --> 00:11:47,579
start so where you're gonna start is you

288
00:11:47,579 --> 00:11:49,199
got to develop a paint plan you got

289
00:11:49,199 --> 00:11:51,239
we're going to do a gap analysis you're

290
00:11:51,239 --> 00:11:52,529
gonna fill those gaps if you don't have

291
00:11:52,529 --> 00:11:54,989
IT experience those technologies you'll

292
00:11:54,989 --> 00:11:56,600
have experience and learn those

293
00:11:56,600 --> 00:11:58,289
understanding different upper state

294
00:11:58,289 --> 00:12:01,169
operating systems like Linux and Windows

295
00:12:01,169 --> 00:12:02,699
is very important since those the two

296
00:12:02,699 --> 00:12:03,959
most popular ones you're gonna see

297
00:12:03,959 --> 00:12:07,319
hardware and networking if you have IT

298
00:12:07,319 --> 00:12:10,679
experience then learn Linux and security

299
00:12:10,679 --> 00:12:12,480
and the networking and if you have

300
00:12:12,480 --> 00:12:14,100
InfoSec experience to fill in the gaps

301
00:12:14,100 --> 00:12:15,959
you know that you may have missing you

302
00:12:15,959 --> 00:12:17,609
may work in an area that does a lot of

303
00:12:17,609 --> 00:12:20,189
Linux and maybe you don't so learn those

304
00:12:20,189 --> 00:12:22,850
those areas that you're weak in

305
00:12:22,850 --> 00:12:25,049
participating in bug bounties and

306
00:12:25,049 --> 00:12:26,759
capture the flags are a good way to get

307
00:12:26,759 --> 00:12:28,919
experience this is a way to get some

308
00:12:28,919 --> 00:12:31,439
hands-on hacking experience and the bug

309
00:12:31,439 --> 00:12:32,639
bounty is actually let you get

310
00:12:32,639 --> 00:12:34,470
real-world experience so you're hacking

311
00:12:34,470 --> 00:12:36,660
in production environments and be able

312
00:12:36,660 --> 00:12:38,879
to describe how you found these

313
00:12:38,879 --> 00:12:40,619
vulnerabilities or hacked into these

314
00:12:40,619 --> 00:12:42,149
certain vulnerabilities were able to

315
00:12:42,149 --> 00:12:46,459
exploit those or a good way to uh

316
00:12:46,459 --> 00:12:48,989
explained on during an interview and

317
00:12:48,989 --> 00:12:50,789
what employer knows what your background

318
00:12:50,789 --> 00:12:52,859
is if you don't have the pen testing

319
00:12:52,859 --> 00:12:54,959
experience and then they will see that

320
00:12:54,959 --> 00:12:56,850
you know the concepts and you could be

321
00:12:56,850 --> 00:12:59,389
you know brought in as an entry-level

322
00:12:59,389 --> 00:13:02,399
pen tester and everyone no matter what

323
00:13:02,399 --> 00:13:05,150
level build a lab

324
00:13:05,150 --> 00:13:06,710
and the different labs so you need your

325
00:13:06,710 --> 00:13:09,230
lab setup the men list laughs is one of

326
00:13:09,230 --> 00:13:11,570
the more common ones and I like because

327
00:13:11,570 --> 00:13:13,160
it's portable this is where you have

328
00:13:13,160 --> 00:13:16,490
your your attack operating system as

329
00:13:16,490 --> 00:13:19,160
well as your target hosts and then you

330
00:13:19,160 --> 00:13:20,630
have a dedicated lab where you can have

331
00:13:20,630 --> 00:13:22,640
a separate computer with your vulnerable

332
00:13:22,640 --> 00:13:25,930
VMs on it and a separate attack machine

333
00:13:25,930 --> 00:13:28,280
and then you can even get more advanced

334
00:13:28,280 --> 00:13:29,480
you can break it down to separate

335
00:13:29,480 --> 00:13:32,450
individual pieces of hardware and not as

336
00:13:32,450 --> 00:13:36,320
much on the the virtualization but a

337
00:13:36,320 --> 00:13:37,910
word of caution here is if you're trying

338
00:13:37,910 --> 00:13:40,960
to learn the pen testing piece of this

339
00:13:40,960 --> 00:13:44,270
you may go with more of a minimalist lab

340
00:13:44,270 --> 00:13:46,610
because you're gonna have problems with

341
00:13:46,610 --> 00:13:49,100
networks communicating and well that's

342
00:13:49,100 --> 00:13:50,900
good experience it may be slow down

343
00:13:50,900 --> 00:13:52,280
you're learning as far as trying to

344
00:13:52,280 --> 00:13:54,110
learn the pen testing and hacking piece

345
00:13:54,110 --> 00:13:56,930
of it so kind of keep that in mind when

346
00:13:56,930 --> 00:13:58,700
you're going you're you're deciding on

347
00:13:58,700 --> 00:14:03,830
the complexity that you want and you're

348
00:14:03,830 --> 00:14:05,540
gonna need your attack platform Kali

349
00:14:05,540 --> 00:14:08,210
Linux is the one I recommend the most

350
00:14:08,210 --> 00:14:10,850
parrot OS is good it's another Linux

351
00:14:10,850 --> 00:14:13,610
distribution in the new bun to you with

352
00:14:13,610 --> 00:14:16,820
the pen tester framework it's a project

353
00:14:16,820 --> 00:14:18,620
from trusted SEC that's a script that

354
00:14:18,620 --> 00:14:20,330
you can run on a bun too and it installs

355
00:14:20,330 --> 00:14:22,580
the pen testing and hacking tools that

356
00:14:22,580 --> 00:14:25,040
you use for pen testing and you can also

357
00:14:25,040 --> 00:14:28,070
use commando VM whether it's a set of

358
00:14:28,070 --> 00:14:29,900
scripts by fireEye that runs on Windows

359
00:14:29,900 --> 00:14:33,080
10 and windows still has still important

360
00:14:33,080 --> 00:14:35,510
use for pen testing when some of the

361
00:14:35,510 --> 00:14:38,270
earlier distributions of predecessors to

362
00:14:38,270 --> 00:14:40,820
Kali Linux like backtrack came out a lot

363
00:14:40,820 --> 00:14:41,780
of people started getting away from

364
00:14:41,780 --> 00:14:43,550
Windows but Windows is still valuable to

365
00:14:43,550 --> 00:14:45,890
have since most Windows networks are

366
00:14:45,890 --> 00:14:47,810
running active directory some of the

367
00:14:47,810 --> 00:14:49,340
native tools like your administrative

368
00:14:49,340 --> 00:14:51,350
tools are helpful to have so having a

369
00:14:51,350 --> 00:14:54,680
Windows VM as good as well and

370
00:14:54,680 --> 00:14:57,500
understanding how to use both the

371
00:14:57,500 --> 00:14:59,930
Windows and Linux platform is important

372
00:14:59,930 --> 00:15:03,320
even from the attack platform as well as

373
00:15:03,320 --> 00:15:06,020
the attack targets then your home lab

374
00:15:06,020 --> 00:15:07,970
targets so you can create vulturo

375
00:15:07,970 --> 00:15:11,270
different virtual machines using ball

376
00:15:11,270 --> 00:15:13,430
hub Metasploit able to and three I

377
00:15:13,430 --> 00:15:15,560
highly recommend the advantage to

378
00:15:15,560 --> 00:15:18,780
Metasploit able to and three

379
00:15:18,780 --> 00:15:20,910
is that you have a lot of

380
00:15:20,910 --> 00:15:22,740
vulnerabilities on there to exploit

381
00:15:22,740 --> 00:15:25,490
whereas if you build individual apps

382
00:15:25,490 --> 00:15:27,300
vulnerable apps you may have a lot more

383
00:15:27,300 --> 00:15:30,180
targets taking up more resources on your

384
00:15:30,180 --> 00:15:32,760
your lab so you might want to keep that

385
00:15:32,760 --> 00:15:34,140
in mining these are really great to

386
00:15:34,140 --> 00:15:36,930
start out with and OWASP webgoat is

387
00:15:36,930 --> 00:15:39,390
another one for web app pen testing you

388
00:15:39,390 --> 00:15:41,430
have buggy web app there's like and you

389
00:15:41,430 --> 00:15:43,350
shop a lot of other vulnerable apps that

390
00:15:43,350 --> 00:15:44,910
you can use you can create your own

391
00:15:44,910 --> 00:15:46,650
vulnerable targets from downloading

392
00:15:46,650 --> 00:15:49,710
vulnerable software from exploit DB so

393
00:15:49,710 --> 00:15:50,640
you can go out there find the

394
00:15:50,640 --> 00:15:52,800
vulnerabilities and download the

395
00:15:52,800 --> 00:15:55,410
vulnerable version of the software and

396
00:15:55,410 --> 00:15:57,780
set that up to build your own lab and

397
00:15:57,780 --> 00:16:00,180
you can build like a CTF if you want as

398
00:16:00,180 --> 00:16:01,830
well you could get together friends and

399
00:16:01,830 --> 00:16:04,920
build your own virtual vm's and and have

400
00:16:04,920 --> 00:16:08,940
your own CTF s-- and recommended reading

401
00:16:08,940 --> 00:16:12,630
some reading that i recommend for this

402
00:16:12,630 --> 00:16:15,150
in georgia Weidman x' book a hands-on

403
00:16:15,150 --> 00:16:17,790
introduction to hacking this is a great

404
00:16:17,790 --> 00:16:18,960
book and this is the one I recommend

405
00:16:18,960 --> 00:16:21,210
starting out with because this takes you

406
00:16:21,210 --> 00:16:23,430
through all the basics takes you through

407
00:16:23,430 --> 00:16:25,830
setting up your own home lab I actually

408
00:16:25,830 --> 00:16:27,930
was using this for my ethical hacking

409
00:16:27,930 --> 00:16:31,380
class the first year and we moved on to

410
00:16:31,380 --> 00:16:33,120
the pen test plus to give students an

411
00:16:33,120 --> 00:16:35,850
opportunity to get a certification along

412
00:16:35,850 --> 00:16:37,740
the way but this is a really great book

413
00:16:37,740 --> 00:16:40,580
to start with and I would move on from

414
00:16:40,580 --> 00:16:42,870
George's book to the the hackers

415
00:16:42,870 --> 00:16:46,860
playbook version 2 & 3 version 2 is more

416
00:16:46,860 --> 00:16:49,410
pen testing centric with version 3

417
00:16:49,410 --> 00:16:54,810
having more Red Team items in there so

418
00:16:54,810 --> 00:16:55,770
if you want to learn more about red

419
00:16:55,770 --> 00:16:57,270
teaming that's a good one to progress to

420
00:16:57,270 --> 00:16:59,190
but I would definitely go with the

421
00:16:59,190 --> 00:17:01,200
version 2 of the book first web

422
00:17:01,200 --> 00:17:03,000
application hacker's handbook is really

423
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:04,410
good for web app pen testing and I

424
00:17:04,410 --> 00:17:06,960
highly recommend that that book it's a

425
00:17:06,960 --> 00:17:08,490
really good one to learn I use that from

426
00:17:08,490 --> 00:17:11,040
a web app pen testing class and it's

427
00:17:11,040 --> 00:17:14,910
created by one of the writers of ports

428
00:17:14,910 --> 00:17:16,829
wiggers burp suite which is very popular

429
00:17:16,829 --> 00:17:18,990
web application pen testing tool so

430
00:17:18,990 --> 00:17:20,250
that's a really good book to start out

431
00:17:20,250 --> 00:17:22,380
with and then the Red Team filled manual

432
00:17:22,380 --> 00:17:24,540
just a good general manual for pen

433
00:17:24,540 --> 00:17:28,280
testers they've got different syntax for

434
00:17:28,280 --> 00:17:31,480
Cisco in map syntax

435
00:17:31,480 --> 00:17:33,760
PowerShell it's a lot of quick a quick

436
00:17:33,760 --> 00:17:35,410
reference guide that you can find stuff

437
00:17:35,410 --> 00:17:38,410
without having to go search around the

438
00:17:38,410 --> 00:17:39,640
internet to find it so it's a really

439
00:17:39,640 --> 00:17:43,059
quick quick easy to access resource

440
00:17:43,059 --> 00:17:45,610
lightweight if you have to travel and

441
00:17:45,610 --> 00:17:46,780
carried around this is a really small

442
00:17:46,780 --> 00:17:48,940
book so it's really doesn't take up much

443
00:17:48,940 --> 00:17:56,830
space awaked in your your travel kit and

444
00:17:56,830 --> 00:17:58,390
here are some learning resources here

445
00:17:58,390 --> 00:18:00,850
that and actually if you don't

446
00:18:00,850 --> 00:18:02,559
screenshot this if you want to get the

447
00:18:02,559 --> 00:18:04,330
actual links if you go to my website the

448
00:18:04,330 --> 00:18:07,600
hacker maker com4 slash learning -

449
00:18:07,600 --> 00:18:10,929
resources then you can download these

450
00:18:10,929 --> 00:18:13,630
resources there and I have these

451
00:18:13,630 --> 00:18:18,429
resources listed from from free to lower

452
00:18:18,429 --> 00:18:25,049
cost and also some different range of

453
00:18:25,049 --> 00:18:28,150
courses like your sans courses these are

454
00:18:28,150 --> 00:18:30,059
going to be some of your very

455
00:18:30,059 --> 00:18:32,290
well-written courses by industry

456
00:18:32,290 --> 00:18:34,780
professionals and that's these they have

457
00:18:34,780 --> 00:18:36,580
really great courses there I've taking

458
00:18:36,580 --> 00:18:39,520
their web a pen testing course their

459
00:18:39,520 --> 00:18:41,980
advanced pen testing course good stuff

460
00:18:41,980 --> 00:18:45,220
and II learned security is less

461
00:18:45,220 --> 00:18:47,169
expensive than sans and they've got like

462
00:18:47,169 --> 00:18:49,120
a wide range of courses from web app pen

463
00:18:49,120 --> 00:18:52,330
testing to Network pen testing thread

464
00:18:52,330 --> 00:18:53,500
hunting they've got a lot of different

465
00:18:53,500 --> 00:18:55,750
good courses there is we'll have some

466
00:18:55,750 --> 00:18:57,940
advanced pen testing courses in virtual

467
00:18:57,940 --> 00:18:59,890
hacking labs if you're wanting to get

468
00:18:59,890 --> 00:19:02,830
certified in OSC P this is a good one to

469
00:19:02,830 --> 00:19:05,950
use to kind of prep before you start the

470
00:19:05,950 --> 00:19:08,290
osep course because unless you're ready

471
00:19:08,290 --> 00:19:11,200
you really need to have a little bit of

472
00:19:11,200 --> 00:19:12,309
a background before you start that

473
00:19:12,309 --> 00:19:16,720
course it's kind of one of the more some

474
00:19:16,720 --> 00:19:18,429
people consider entry-level it's a

475
00:19:18,429 --> 00:19:20,320
entry-level pentesting certification but

476
00:19:20,320 --> 00:19:22,540
entry-level in certain fields like

477
00:19:22,540 --> 00:19:24,790
digital forensics so pen testing doesn't

478
00:19:24,790 --> 00:19:27,160
mean it's easy it's wouldn't you when

479
00:19:27,160 --> 00:19:30,160
compared to an entry-level IT course but

480
00:19:30,160 --> 00:19:31,660
that's a good place to get in there and

481
00:19:31,660 --> 00:19:34,150
hack around there's even like an Android

482
00:19:34,150 --> 00:19:36,250
device in there to hack they have a

483
00:19:36,250 --> 00:19:38,980
short course in and one of the things I

484
00:19:38,980 --> 00:19:41,070
like about it is each one of the systems

485
00:19:41,070 --> 00:19:43,540
shows you the difficulty and it'll give

486
00:19:43,540 --> 00:19:44,500
you hints as

487
00:19:44,500 --> 00:19:46,360
you get to the more advanced boxes that

488
00:19:46,360 --> 00:19:48,340
give you less information it's up to you

489
00:19:48,340 --> 00:19:51,180
to hack that with your own research

490
00:19:51,180 --> 00:19:53,890
without all the help but it helps kind

491
00:19:53,890 --> 00:19:55,510
of build you up and ramp you up to the

492
00:19:55,510 --> 00:19:57,880
more difficult boxes and then pentester

493
00:19:57,880 --> 00:19:59,940
academy they've got a really great

494
00:19:59,940 --> 00:20:02,730
online lab called attack and defense lab

495
00:20:02,730 --> 00:20:05,620
so they have some really good resources

496
00:20:05,620 --> 00:20:09,880
there the labs are great as well as the

497
00:20:09,880 --> 00:20:11,440
different courses videos are the courses

498
00:20:11,440 --> 00:20:14,740
this is one of the first resources I'll

499
00:20:14,740 --> 00:20:15,820
learn about when I was getting into pen

500
00:20:15,820 --> 00:20:18,010
testing it was originally security tube

501
00:20:18,010 --> 00:20:20,800
and then practical pen test labs this is

502
00:20:20,800 --> 00:20:24,730
a 64 64 dollar course for lifetime

503
00:20:24,730 --> 00:20:27,130
access last time I saw so this is a good

504
00:20:27,130 --> 00:20:28,990
cheap inexpensive way to get some

505
00:20:28,990 --> 00:20:31,480
hacking experience and then on to the

506
00:20:31,480 --> 00:20:33,100
free resources you get blood crab

507
00:20:33,100 --> 00:20:35,370
University so if you're wanting to be a

508
00:20:35,370 --> 00:20:38,290
bug hunter then this is a really good

509
00:20:38,290 --> 00:20:42,040
resource there as well tacker one these

510
00:20:42,040 --> 00:20:43,360
are both of those are really good

511
00:20:43,360 --> 00:20:46,600
resources to learn bug hunting and then

512
00:20:46,600 --> 00:20:49,510
Sam's pin testing blog which has a lot

513
00:20:49,510 --> 00:20:52,240
of cheat sheets on in map different pen

514
00:20:52,240 --> 00:20:54,910
testing tools and Metasploit and then

515
00:20:54,910 --> 00:20:56,890
hacking tutorials org the creators of

516
00:20:56,890 --> 00:20:59,590
virtual hacking labs has this free site

517
00:20:59,590 --> 00:21:01,240
and it has tutorials on the different

518
00:21:01,240 --> 00:21:04,360
hacking tools and then cyber AI key they

519
00:21:04,360 --> 00:21:07,690
have some good free courses on there the

520
00:21:07,690 --> 00:21:09,520
advanced pen testing course is based on

521
00:21:09,520 --> 00:21:11,830
is written by Georgia Weidman and it's

522
00:21:11,830 --> 00:21:14,260
based on the her book and so it's a

523
00:21:14,260 --> 00:21:16,500
really good place it's got videos and

524
00:21:16,500 --> 00:21:19,360
slides for the course it's highly

525
00:21:19,360 --> 00:21:21,010
recommend that I actually used to use

526
00:21:21,010 --> 00:21:23,260
that as a resource on my web and my

527
00:21:23,260 --> 00:21:25,750
ethical hacking class and web security

528
00:21:25,750 --> 00:21:27,940
Academy by ports where the creators at

529
00:21:27,940 --> 00:21:30,700
burp suite instead of updating the web

530
00:21:30,700 --> 00:21:32,860
application hacker's handbook they

531
00:21:32,860 --> 00:21:35,050
create online labs and learning content

532
00:21:35,050 --> 00:21:36,940
so this is really extensive if you want

533
00:21:36,940 --> 00:21:38,860
to learn web app pen testing or bug

534
00:21:38,860 --> 00:21:40,390
hunting this is a good place to start

535
00:21:40,390 --> 00:21:43,170
because it takes you through all the

536
00:21:43,170 --> 00:21:44,950
different web application

537
00:21:44,950 --> 00:21:46,480
vulnerabilities and it has associated

538
00:21:46,480 --> 00:21:49,480
labs with those and then a wasp don't

539
00:21:49,480 --> 00:21:51,400
work because you have the OWASP testing

540
00:21:51,400 --> 00:21:54,220
guy in the West taught top ten links to

541
00:21:54,220 --> 00:21:55,660
different vulnerable vm's

542
00:21:55,660 --> 00:21:57,470
in vulnerable application

543
00:21:57,470 --> 00:22:00,289
like Jew shop or listed there and then

544
00:22:00,289 --> 00:22:02,270
hacked the box dot edu this is a really

545
00:22:02,270 --> 00:22:06,080
good place to to prepare for the OS CP

546
00:22:06,080 --> 00:22:08,659
and just get that hacking experience in

547
00:22:08,659 --> 00:22:11,049
and then the over the wire CTF wargames

548
00:22:11,049 --> 00:22:12,740
they have some different online

549
00:22:12,740 --> 00:22:14,780
challenges there and you it's a really

550
00:22:14,780 --> 00:22:17,270
good place to learn Linux security so

551
00:22:17,270 --> 00:22:19,190
understanding the different operating

552
00:22:19,190 --> 00:22:21,559
systems security makes it easier to to

553
00:22:21,559 --> 00:22:22,760
hack so this is a really good place to

554
00:22:22,760 --> 00:22:25,220
learn Linux security there and those can

555
00:22:25,220 --> 00:22:30,700
be found that that URL below and

556
00:22:30,700 --> 00:22:32,690
certifications counter your entry level

557
00:22:32,690 --> 00:22:35,120
pen test certifications is ceh by

558
00:22:35,120 --> 00:22:37,510
ec-council and pen test plus by CompTIA

559
00:22:37,510 --> 00:22:41,299
ec-council is a DoD cert and so there's

560
00:22:41,299 --> 00:22:44,780
a lot of government jobs that they

561
00:22:44,780 --> 00:22:47,750
require a ceh so that's one of the good

562
00:22:47,750 --> 00:22:49,460
reasons they have that their pen test

563
00:22:49,460 --> 00:22:51,110
plus is fairly new but it's really heavy

564
00:22:51,110 --> 00:22:53,840
on methodology I use the pen test blue

565
00:22:53,840 --> 00:22:57,400
pen test plus book for my class and

566
00:22:57,400 --> 00:22:59,990
intermediate certs here are your G pen

567
00:22:59,990 --> 00:23:03,559
from sans and the OS CP from offensive

568
00:23:03,559 --> 00:23:07,690
security and the offensive security

569
00:23:07,690 --> 00:23:09,890
certs are really great to have because

570
00:23:09,890 --> 00:23:10,940
you actually have to go through a lab

571
00:23:10,940 --> 00:23:14,090
and hack into different servers to get

572
00:23:14,090 --> 00:23:15,620
your certification so you actually have

573
00:23:15,620 --> 00:23:17,870
to go through the process of a pen test

574
00:23:17,870 --> 00:23:19,669
to earn your certification but then you

575
00:23:19,669 --> 00:23:22,039
have your advanced certs the G XP n by

576
00:23:22,039 --> 00:23:23,870
sans which is our advanced pen test and

577
00:23:23,870 --> 00:23:26,450
exploit the Vilma course in OSC is

578
00:23:26,450 --> 00:23:28,730
offensive securities course which is a

579
00:23:28,730 --> 00:23:31,490
similar type course these last four

580
00:23:31,490 --> 00:23:33,919
certs you'll see a lot in pen testing

581
00:23:33,919 --> 00:23:36,440
jobs at different levels usually these

582
00:23:36,440 --> 00:23:39,049
are requirements one of these four along

583
00:23:39,049 --> 00:23:40,700
with the sans web application pen

584
00:23:40,700 --> 00:23:42,710
testing course those will be the five

585
00:23:42,710 --> 00:23:46,190
most sought after certifications for

586
00:23:46,190 --> 00:23:48,549
people that want to be pen testers

587
00:23:48,549 --> 00:23:51,080
improve in job tips professional network

588
00:23:51,080 --> 00:23:52,669
and get out there and get involved your

589
00:23:52,669 --> 00:23:54,679
local community here in Dallas we're

590
00:23:54,679 --> 00:23:55,909
fortunate to have Dallas hackers

591
00:23:55,909 --> 00:23:58,789
association a lot of the great groups a

592
00:23:58,789 --> 00:24:00,770
community just different groups clubs

593
00:24:00,770 --> 00:24:02,809
and conferences just get out there

594
00:24:02,809 --> 00:24:04,220
network because you get to know people

595
00:24:04,220 --> 00:24:06,950
and they find out of jobs and they know

596
00:24:06,950 --> 00:24:08,419
you they can refer you I've referred

597
00:24:08,419 --> 00:24:10,460
people in the community as well as my

598
00:24:10,460 --> 00:24:11,280
last three

599
00:24:11,280 --> 00:24:13,230
time jobs I've been have been referrals

600
00:24:13,230 --> 00:24:15,480
so once you get out there community and

601
00:24:15,480 --> 00:24:17,400
get to know people and they know you

602
00:24:17,400 --> 00:24:18,960
then it makes looking for a job a lot

603
00:24:18,960 --> 00:24:19,350
easier

604
00:24:19,350 --> 00:24:21,630
and then LinkedIn your Linkedin is your

605
00:24:21,630 --> 00:24:23,670
online resume so make sure you have it

606
00:24:23,670 --> 00:24:26,670
as detailed as your resume keep her

607
00:24:26,670 --> 00:24:28,260
professional on LinkedIn it's a

608
00:24:28,260 --> 00:24:30,540
professional side it's not Facebook so

609
00:24:30,540 --> 00:24:31,890
you want to keep that professional

610
00:24:31,890 --> 00:24:34,800
interview tips make sure you prepare for

611
00:24:34,800 --> 00:24:36,930
your interviews know the OWASP top ten

612
00:24:36,930 --> 00:24:38,250
even though it's if it's a network

613
00:24:38,250 --> 00:24:40,680
pentesting course i mean a network

614
00:24:40,680 --> 00:24:42,030
pentesting job they're still gonna ask

615
00:24:42,030 --> 00:24:43,740
you gulnur abilities from the a wasp

616
00:24:43,740 --> 00:24:46,740
atop ten to describe the vulnerabilities

617
00:24:46,740 --> 00:24:48,900
the different variations of the

618
00:24:48,900 --> 00:24:50,550
vulnerabilities and how to remediate

619
00:24:50,550 --> 00:24:52,380
those vulnerabilities so you see that a

620
00:24:52,380 --> 00:24:54,870
lot be able to explain the basics like

621
00:24:54,870 --> 00:24:57,000
through a TCP handshake in OSI model

622
00:24:57,000 --> 00:24:58,950
these you'll get a lot from management

623
00:24:58,950 --> 00:25:01,430
because they may be a little more

624
00:25:01,430 --> 00:25:03,720
withdrawn from the actual pen testing

625
00:25:03,720 --> 00:25:05,250
technology been away for a while but the

626
00:25:05,250 --> 00:25:07,440
basics like that you're always gonna get

627
00:25:07,440 --> 00:25:10,140
asked that to see what your level of

628
00:25:10,140 --> 00:25:12,270
knowledge is in any resume make sure

629
00:25:12,270 --> 00:25:15,480
you're putting on your resume what you

630
00:25:15,480 --> 00:25:19,640
know make sure you know the the the

631
00:25:19,640 --> 00:25:21,660
subjects because you don't want to get

632
00:25:21,660 --> 00:25:25,110
in there and look like you're being

633
00:25:25,110 --> 00:25:27,210
dishonest on your resume because if you

634
00:25:27,210 --> 00:25:28,410
get in there they're going to ask you

635
00:25:28,410 --> 00:25:30,090
questions so your resume you're kind of

636
00:25:30,090 --> 00:25:33,300
out laying out lining your interview so

637
00:25:33,300 --> 00:25:35,100
if you've got items on there that you

638
00:25:35,100 --> 00:25:37,230
don't know that well you know make sure

639
00:25:37,230 --> 00:25:38,940
you clarify that you the amount of

640
00:25:38,940 --> 00:25:41,370
experience you have with that and don't

641
00:25:41,370 --> 00:25:42,540
put things on there you haven't worked

642
00:25:42,540 --> 00:25:44,040
with because when I'm interviewing

643
00:25:44,040 --> 00:25:45,990
someone I'll go through and that's how

644
00:25:45,990 --> 00:25:47,820
any most interviewers you know look at

645
00:25:47,820 --> 00:25:49,950
your resume they're gonna tell their to

646
00:25:49,950 --> 00:25:52,770
ask you the questions so make sure that

647
00:25:52,770 --> 00:25:54,600
you explain things well and then during

648
00:25:54,600 --> 00:25:57,360
the interview if you don't have much

649
00:25:57,360 --> 00:25:58,740
experience in certain area tell them the

650
00:25:58,740 --> 00:26:00,210
education background you have in that

651
00:26:00,210 --> 00:26:04,230
way you've been doing to learn that and

652
00:26:04,230 --> 00:26:06,420

sessions and we're streaming those so

663
00:26:31,830 --> 00:26:36,420
during this social isolation period that

664
00:26:36,420 --> 00:26:38,820
gives people a way to continue to learn

665
00:26:38,820 --> 00:26:41,400
and we have a chat so people can talk

666
00:26:41,400 --> 00:26:44,340
during the meetups communicate with each

667
00:26:44,340 --> 00:26:47,450
other and still get that interaction and

668
00:26:47,450 --> 00:26:50,070
you should check out our podcast the

669
00:26:50,070 --> 00:26:52,050
uncommon journey it's available to the

670
00:26:52,050 --> 00:26:52,680
IPPS

671
00:26:52,680 --> 00:26:55,560
IT SP magazine we've got a lot of great

672
00:26:55,560 --> 00:26:59,030
content on there you should check out

673
00:27:00,440 --> 00:27:02,580
well thank you very much but we got

674
00:27:02,580 --> 00:27:04,800
questions in the slack we had questions

675
00:27:04,800 --> 00:27:07,200
in the Q&A panel we got questions on

676
00:27:07,200 --> 00:27:09,330
Twitter we got questions over SMS even

677
00:27:09,330 --> 00:27:11,580
so some of them are serious questions

678
00:27:11,580 --> 00:27:13,470
and a couple are not so serious so if we

679
00:27:13,470 --> 00:27:14,700
get the web time we'll get to the nuts

680
00:27:14,700 --> 00:27:16,650
as usual but the first one is I've

681
00:27:16,650 --> 00:27:18,180
always wanted to be a pen tester but I

682
00:27:18,180 --> 00:27:20,310
just didn't know where to start I have a

683
00:27:20,310 --> 00:27:22,560
lab and I will watch every video I can

684
00:27:22,560 --> 00:27:24,780
but who would ever let me do my first

685
00:27:24,780 --> 00:27:27,870
pen test well that's where that's where

686
00:27:27,870 --> 00:27:30,570
you go out and do your the bug bounties

687
00:27:30,570 --> 00:27:31,740
so you can get some experience doing

688
00:27:31,740 --> 00:27:34,080
webapp pen tests also something else to

689
00:27:34,080 --> 00:27:36,360
consider is doing pro bono work find

690
00:27:36,360 --> 00:27:39,210
some nonprofits that may need pen tests

691
00:27:39,210 --> 00:27:41,730
done and go through there and be careful

692
00:27:41,730 --> 00:27:43,050
what you're doing you don't want to get

693
00:27:43,050 --> 00:27:45,630
out there and break someone's Network so

694
00:27:45,630 --> 00:27:47,310
maybe even do some vulnerability scans

695
00:27:47,310 --> 00:27:48,090
okay

696
00:27:48,090 --> 00:27:50,160
vulnerability assessment and progress on

697
00:27:50,160 --> 00:27:51,960
from there you know as you build that

698
00:27:51,960 --> 00:27:55,170
lab I got into pen testing because I had

699
00:27:55,170 --> 00:27:57,720
experience with vulnerability scanners

700
00:27:57,720 --> 00:27:59,400
but I had pen tests but I had a home lab

701
00:27:59,400 --> 00:28:01,290
I was passionate and willing to learn

702
00:28:01,290 --> 00:28:03,150
and they took a chance on me I really

703
00:28:03,150 --> 00:28:05,220
wasn't didn't have everything I needed

704
00:28:05,220 --> 00:28:09,060
for the job what do you think is gonna

705
00:28:09,060 --> 00:28:11,190
happen to penetration testing once the

706
00:28:11,190 --> 00:28:16,290
pandemic is over I think it's probably

707
00:28:16,290 --> 00:28:17,940
going to improve I think some people

708
00:28:17,940 --> 00:28:20,790
that may have not planned and tested

709
00:28:20,790 --> 00:28:22,830
properly I think it's gonna ramp up

710
00:28:22,830 --> 00:28:24,320
people are gonna take advantage of

711
00:28:24,320 --> 00:28:27,150
consultants being able to be on-site so

712
00:28:27,150 --> 00:28:28,050
I think it's a good thing you know

713
00:28:28,050 --> 00:28:29,420
because some companies are kind of

714
00:28:29,420 --> 00:28:32,400
putting things on hold because their IT

715
00:28:32,400 --> 00:28:34,470
freezes so I think you'll kind of pick

716
00:28:34,470 --> 00:28:35,820
back up and then some people are gonna

717
00:28:35,820 --> 00:28:37,230
see the need for it you see all these

718
00:28:37,230 --> 00:28:38,980
vulnerabilities out there

719
00:28:38,980 --> 00:28:41,890
and they say that exploits are up since

720
00:28:41,890 --> 00:28:44,169
the pandemic so I think people are gonna

721
00:28:44,169 --> 00:28:46,330
see the need for that and it's and with

722
00:28:46,330 --> 00:28:48,520
all the online streaming content out

723
00:28:48,520 --> 00:28:52,139
there I think it's providing awareness

724
00:28:52,530 --> 00:28:54,400
somebody this isn't really a question

725
00:28:54,400 --> 00:28:55,600
but somebody said I really like that

726
00:28:55,600 --> 00:28:56,980
hacker mindset the creative and

727
00:28:56,980 --> 00:28:58,720
analytical thinking I really like that I

728
00:28:58,720 --> 00:29:00,429
like that so that's just good feedback

729
00:29:00,429 --> 00:29:02,740
from a tiger mindset I guess is it more

730
00:29:02,740 --> 00:29:04,360
important to learn Windows 10 or Kali

731
00:29:04,360 --> 00:29:11,230
Linux okay I would say probably Windows

732
00:29:11,230 --> 00:29:12,820
10 if you do that if you use the hacking

733
00:29:12,820 --> 00:29:14,080
tools because what I'll say there is

734
00:29:14,080 --> 00:29:16,600
most of your targets are going to be

735
00:29:16,600 --> 00:29:19,630
Windows so I'd say it's a priority I

736
00:29:19,630 --> 00:29:21,580
would prioritize Windows 10 with the

737
00:29:21,580 --> 00:29:22,990
hacking tools you have to know what

738
00:29:22,990 --> 00:29:24,730
cracking tools but you know when you get

739
00:29:24,730 --> 00:29:26,049
in environments you're hacking you need

740
00:29:26,049 --> 00:29:27,640
to understand pen testing you need to

741
00:29:27,640 --> 00:29:29,799
understand Windows so I think that's a

742
00:29:29,799 --> 00:29:31,600
priority but it's good to know both of

743
00:29:31,600 --> 00:29:33,429
them but I prioritize Windows 10 if you

744
00:29:33,429 --> 00:29:36,580
don't know Linux yet could you tell us a

745
00:29:36,580 --> 00:29:39,460
little bit about a good setup for a lab

746
00:29:39,460 --> 00:29:41,650
that is VM only that I guess I would be

747
00:29:41,650 --> 00:29:43,900
virtual machine only for in a lab

748
00:29:43,900 --> 00:29:45,580
environment could you describe a good

749
00:29:45,580 --> 00:29:47,230
setup for that yeah a good setup for

750
00:29:47,230 --> 00:29:50,440
that VMware or VirtualBox works well but

751
00:29:50,440 --> 00:29:53,080
for the longest time before you know I

752
00:29:53,080 --> 00:29:54,610
started spending money to get my own

753
00:29:54,610 --> 00:29:56,980
version of VMware I was using VirtualBox

754
00:29:56,980 --> 00:29:59,169
mm-hmm in VirtualBox is nice because

755
00:29:59,169 --> 00:30:01,090
there's only like two or three things

756
00:30:01,090 --> 00:30:02,919
that typically go wrong with VirtualBox

757
00:30:02,919 --> 00:30:04,960
if you don't have a virtualization set

758
00:30:04,960 --> 00:30:07,390
up on your laptop of your computer it's

759
00:30:07,390 --> 00:30:08,470
not gonna work and it's gonna be the

760
00:30:08,470 --> 00:30:12,610
same thing for VMware if the VM was

761
00:30:12,610 --> 00:30:14,470
built with newer versions of the USB you

762
00:30:14,470 --> 00:30:16,210
have to make sure to install the guest

763
00:30:16,210 --> 00:30:17,980
additions to get it to work properly so

764
00:30:17,980 --> 00:30:21,340
she's it's mine it's free and works

765
00:30:21,340 --> 00:30:23,230
pretty solid and I use that as a

766
00:30:23,230 --> 00:30:26,350
recognition of my class and workshops

767
00:30:26,350 --> 00:30:28,120
then they get out there and it's

768
00:30:28,120 --> 00:30:29,980
installed Metasploit able to a

769
00:30:29,980 --> 00:30:32,950
Metasploit able 3 and the good thing is

770
00:30:32,950 --> 00:30:34,540
there's walkthroughs out there too so

771
00:30:34,540 --> 00:30:35,740
you can go through the walkthroughs if

772
00:30:35,740 --> 00:30:37,660
you get stumped you can go through the

773
00:30:37,660 --> 00:30:39,940
walkthrough and also just as a way to

774
00:30:39,940 --> 00:30:42,130
learn going through those walkthroughs

775
00:30:42,130 --> 00:30:43,120
will show you how different people

776
00:30:43,120 --> 00:30:44,860
hacked and they may do something

777
00:30:44,860 --> 00:30:47,200
different so going through those so

778
00:30:47,200 --> 00:30:48,700
let's say Metasploit will 2 & 3 to start

779
00:30:48,700 --> 00:30:50,230
with because they're loaded with a lot

780
00:30:50,230 --> 00:30:52,210
of vulnerabilities mm-hmm and so I'd

781
00:30:52,210 --> 00:30:52,950
start out with that

782
00:30:52,950 --> 00:30:55,110
and then whatever used for your you're

783
00:30:55,110 --> 00:30:57,389
hacking platform and on your your

784
00:30:57,389 --> 00:30:59,130
machine that you're testing with if

785
00:30:59,130 --> 00:31:01,380
you're kind of little resources you can

786
00:31:01,380 --> 00:31:02,820
make your host OS you're hacking

787
00:31:02,820 --> 00:31:04,649
platform and then just install the VMS

788
00:31:04,649 --> 00:31:06,870
on there because virtualbox runs on on

789
00:31:06,870 --> 00:31:10,110
Linux so you can install a different and

790
00:31:10,110 --> 00:31:11,789
VirtualBox is free is that right it's is

791
00:31:11,789 --> 00:31:14,639
it ok yeah so that's definitely less

792
00:31:14,639 --> 00:31:15,889
supportive I'm much more affordable

793
00:31:15,889 --> 00:31:18,269
interesting yes to a lot of the

794
00:31:18,269 --> 00:31:20,610
vulnerable VMS out there mostly are on

795
00:31:20,610 --> 00:31:23,519
VirtualBox they'll work vmware but a lot

796
00:31:23,519 --> 00:31:24,659
of think a lot of people realize most

797
00:31:24,659 --> 00:31:27,120
people are using the cheaper option of

798
00:31:27,120 --> 00:31:30,240
the tea so you have a lot of these

799
00:31:30,240 --> 00:31:31,919
resources that are online both phone

800
00:31:31,919 --> 00:31:34,409
school and your own websites there's a

801
00:31:34,409 --> 00:31:36,090
lot of recordings of these for if people

802
00:31:36,090 --> 00:31:36,960
want a lot more additional information

803
00:31:36,960 --> 00:31:39,419
and what would your twitter handle is

804
00:31:39,419 --> 00:31:43,080
philip wiley oh one word all right we

805
00:31:43,080 --> 00:31:44,340
did get a couple questions about

806
00:31:44,340 --> 00:31:45,779
professional wrestling but i'm not quite

807
00:31:45,779 --> 00:31:47,820
sure if i can ask those or not but i

808
00:31:47,820 --> 00:31:52,649
just has one were you a heel or a face i

809
00:31:52,649 --> 00:31:57,059
was a face did you generate heat I don't

810
00:31:57,059 --> 00:31:58,350
even know what these things mean when

811
00:31:58,350 --> 00:32:04,980
somebody is heckling from the Dallas

812
00:32:04,980 --> 00:32:06,000
community maybe if they know the

813
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:08,909
terminology that well ok I just figured

814
00:32:08,909 --> 00:32:10,679
it was some friendly some friendly faces

815
00:32:10,679 --> 00:32:13,019
well Phillip we really appreciate you

816
00:32:13,019 --> 00:32:15,240
joining us tonight and enlightening us

817
00:32:15,240 --> 00:32:17,279
on the the blueprint for becoming a

818
00:32:17,279 --> 00:32:20,279
penetration tester thank you very much

819
00:32:20,279 --> 00:32:21,750
for sharing your slides these are also

820
00:32:21,750 --> 00:32:23,730
recorded for those of you that are

821
00:32:23,730 --> 00:32:25,320
tuning in relatively late these are also

822
00:32:25,320 --> 00:32:27,029
recorded and this is all for a good

823
00:32:27,029 --> 00:32:28,710
cause and so thank you very much helpful

824
00:32:28,710 --> 00:32:30,330
you do appreciate you thanks for

825
00:32:30,330 --> 00:32:31,679
