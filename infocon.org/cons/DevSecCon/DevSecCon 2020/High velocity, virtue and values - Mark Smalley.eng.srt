2
00:00:04,319 --> 00:00:08,429
a technical issue yeah I was just I was

3
00:00:08,429 --> 00:00:09,960
just chatting to Jamie in the

4
00:00:09,960 --> 00:00:12,719

6
00:00:16,890 --> 00:00:19,770
was the first like a good idea you just

7
00:00:19,770 --> 00:00:24,900
closed the browser again it's another I

8
00:00:24,900 --> 00:00:29,330
love the Panda by the way on the top

9
00:00:29,940 --> 00:00:31,219
[Music]

10
00:00:31,219 --> 00:00:33,809
yeah and I've got something similar here

11
00:00:33,809 --> 00:00:35,460
on the top of my cupboard here I've got

12
00:00:35,460 --> 00:00:39,239
a Purple Cow and and for anybody who's

13
00:00:39,239 --> 00:00:41,969
interested in marketing that has that

14
00:00:41,969 --> 00:00:44,460
has significance of Purple Cow for the

15
00:00:44,460 --> 00:00:46,770
ha I leave that is something to think

16
00:00:46,770 --> 00:00:49,050
about are we uh

17
00:00:49,050 --> 00:00:51,270
I did not business because I see you

18
00:00:51,270 --> 00:00:53,969
have this two meters t-shirt yeah that's

19
00:00:53,969 --> 00:00:58,020
right I was I was I was agonizing a bit

20
00:00:58,020 --> 00:01:00,510
about what what t-shirt to wear today I

21
00:01:00,510 --> 00:01:02,940
thought I had a choice I thought I could

22
00:01:02,940 --> 00:01:07,710
I could wear the weather DevOps days so

23
00:01:07,710 --> 00:01:10,080
look a little quicker I am area that

24
00:01:10,080 --> 00:01:11,040
yeah that's right

25
00:01:11,040 --> 00:01:12,869
but I I thought I thought that might be

26
00:01:12,869 --> 00:01:14,939
a bit patronizing because because

27
00:01:14,939 --> 00:01:17,250
Patrick's organizing it and I thought I

28
00:01:17,250 --> 00:01:19,350
could I could wear the t-shirt that I

29
00:01:19,350 --> 00:01:22,860
got made to to promote my new book but I

30
00:01:22,860 --> 00:01:24,780
thought that was a bit too commercial so

31
00:01:24,780 --> 00:01:26,759
let's do something topical so if you

32
00:01:26,759 --> 00:01:28,560
just remember keep it tap ears length

33
00:01:28,560 --> 00:01:30,900
from each other you know one and a half

34
00:01:30,900 --> 00:01:32,700
meters 2 meters just to play it safe

35
00:01:32,700 --> 00:01:37,320
then we should we should be good so your

36
00:01:37,320 --> 00:01:39,780
talk is going to be about five velocity

37
00:01:39,780 --> 00:01:41,869
first you and values and it's a

38
00:01:41,869 --> 00:01:44,939
pre-recorded talk and you will be here

39
00:01:44,939 --> 00:01:50,909
for a life Q&A so and yeah and just just

40
00:01:50,909 --> 00:01:53,070
for the for the audience see the talk is

41
00:01:53,070 --> 00:01:55,200
20 minutes so we've got we got plenty of

42
00:01:55,200 --> 00:01:58,049
time for questions and answers so shoot

43
00:01:58,049 --> 00:02:02,490
yeah I'm going to start the screen share

44
00:02:02,490 --> 00:02:05,460
and hopefully if there are no technical

45
00:02:05,460 --> 00:02:11,690
glitches that will work

46
00:02:15,650 --> 00:02:18,689
last year I wrote a book called high

47
00:02:18,689 --> 00:02:23,099
velocity IT this year I wrote a book

48
00:02:23,099 --> 00:02:26,340
about that book called reflections on

49
00:02:26,340 --> 00:02:30,840
high velocity IT this month I wrote an

50
00:02:30,840 --> 00:02:33,719
article about the book about the book

51
00:02:33,719 --> 00:02:37,590
and this is a presentation about well

52
00:02:37,590 --> 00:02:38,760
it's not that bad

53
00:02:38,760 --> 00:02:40,680
but it is something that you would

54
00:02:40,680 --> 00:02:43,079
expect from the IT paradigm ologist

55
00:02:43,079 --> 00:02:46,019
wouldn't you now I'm not a writer a

56
00:02:46,019 --> 00:02:48,720
speaker a trainer I do the the Phoenix

57
00:02:48,720 --> 00:02:51,090
project game which you might be familiar

58
00:02:51,090 --> 00:02:54,060
with which is great fun and I'm a bit of

59
00:02:54,060 --> 00:02:56,549
a bridge builder because I I'm Engle

60
00:02:56,549 --> 00:02:58,620
with with several communities and like

61
00:02:58,620 --> 00:03:01,290
to connect them together feel free to

62
00:03:01,290 --> 00:03:04,650
get in touch with me I'm pretty active

63
00:03:04,650 --> 00:03:06,780
on LinkedIn you'll find lots of my

64
00:03:06,780 --> 00:03:08,819
content there and fairly active on

65
00:03:08,819 --> 00:03:10,969
Twitter as well

66
00:03:10,969 --> 00:03:14,959
now before I add to your cognitive load

67
00:03:14,959 --> 00:03:19,379
I'd like to check in with you on your

68
00:03:19,379 --> 00:03:22,079
emotions so how are you feeling and I

69
00:03:22,079 --> 00:03:23,879
have two questions for you the first one

70
00:03:23,879 --> 00:03:26,609
being what's your energy level high

71
00:03:26,609 --> 00:03:29,459
energy low energy where are you on this

72
00:03:29,459 --> 00:03:34,229
on the spectrum and then second question

73
00:03:34,229 --> 00:03:38,549
is is that positive energy or negative

74
00:03:38,549 --> 00:03:41,609
energy if I manage to annoy you

75
00:03:41,609 --> 00:03:45,090
for instance already because where you

76
00:03:45,090 --> 00:03:47,280
are on these axes that will determine

77
00:03:47,280 --> 00:03:50,129
how you how you view things and this is

78
00:03:50,129 --> 00:03:52,409
this is a nice little exercise I

79
00:03:52,409 --> 00:03:54,449
borrowed it from Simone Jerome or

80
00:03:54,449 --> 00:03:56,849
there's something you can take take back

81
00:03:56,849 --> 00:03:58,500
and do at work either in physical

82
00:03:58,500 --> 00:04:00,599
meetings or virtual meetings just check

83
00:04:00,599 --> 00:04:03,299
in with people's humanity acknowledge

84
00:04:03,299 --> 00:04:04,650
that they're people than them

85
00:04:04,650 --> 00:04:06,329
it's great little thing to know I think

86
00:04:06,329 --> 00:04:08,370
people appreciate that that's just

87
00:04:08,370 --> 00:04:11,220
reflecting on where am i today how can I

88
00:04:11,220 --> 00:04:16,349
contribute now I've been to more

89
00:04:16,349 --> 00:04:18,649
conferences and I can remember and

90
00:04:18,649 --> 00:04:22,770
there's always a pattern that I come

91
00:04:22,770 --> 00:04:24,690
across you might recognize it as well

92
00:04:24,690 --> 00:04:26,550
there's somebody droning

93
00:04:26,550 --> 00:04:27,870
about something that they're passionate

94
00:04:27,870 --> 00:04:31,319
about like I'll be in a minute and you

95
00:04:31,319 --> 00:04:33,470
will be asking yourself three questions

96
00:04:33,470 --> 00:04:37,349
the first button one being huh what on

97
00:04:37,349 --> 00:04:39,629
earth are they talking about because I'm

98
00:04:39,629 --> 00:04:42,090
talking from my frame of reference and

99
00:04:42,090 --> 00:04:43,860
you're listening from your frame of

100
00:04:43,860 --> 00:04:46,050
reference and it would be a miracle if

101
00:04:46,050 --> 00:04:48,419
we were on the same page so that's the

102
00:04:48,419 --> 00:04:51,860
first hurdle to take the second one is

103
00:04:51,860 --> 00:04:55,729
really is there any evidence for that

104
00:04:55,729 --> 00:04:58,710
what's that based on and then the the

105
00:04:58,710 --> 00:05:00,539
final question that you'll find yourself

106
00:05:00,539 --> 00:05:03,169
asking is that you're asking yourself is

107
00:05:03,169 --> 00:05:06,750
so what when I get back to work what's

108
00:05:06,750 --> 00:05:09,030
the relevance of this these questions

109
00:05:09,030 --> 00:05:12,449
hurt really so I think that's that's

110
00:05:12,449 --> 00:05:14,300
something that you're recognized through

111
00:05:14,300 --> 00:05:18,960
throughout conferences now in order to

112
00:05:18,960 --> 00:05:21,810
preempt that that last question the sole

113
00:05:21,810 --> 00:05:25,050
question here are four statements that I

114
00:05:25,050 --> 00:05:28,259
think pretty much summarized the the

115
00:05:28,259 --> 00:05:31,919
talk and which are also the structure of

116
00:05:31,919 --> 00:05:35,009
the talk they're talking about value

117
00:05:35,009 --> 00:05:37,020
particularly from a business perspective

118
00:05:37,020 --> 00:05:39,750
how to sell the great stuff that we do

119
00:05:39,750 --> 00:05:43,770
to business executives values and their

120
00:05:43,770 --> 00:05:46,409
role for a meaningful and rewarding

121
00:05:46,409 --> 00:05:50,880
employee experience from the talks of

122
00:05:50,880 --> 00:05:52,680
the concept of velocity that it's not

123
00:05:52,680 --> 00:05:55,319
just about speed what about trade-offs

124
00:05:55,319 --> 00:05:57,270
and doing the right things quickly and

125
00:05:57,270 --> 00:06:02,719
finally virtue or ethics which is about

126
00:06:02,719 --> 00:06:06,000
deciding which is the least worse course

127
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:08,150
of action as always a compromise with

128
00:06:08,150 --> 00:06:13,889
with ethics so starting with value I'm

129
00:06:13,889 --> 00:06:17,069
sure many of you have seen the movie the

130
00:06:17,069 --> 00:06:19,680
wolf of Wall Street but may remember the

131
00:06:19,680 --> 00:06:23,310
scene that sell me this pen where the

132
00:06:23,310 --> 00:06:27,090
aspiring set builds people try to sell a

133
00:06:27,090 --> 00:06:31,190
pen to the presenter and they

134
00:06:31,190 --> 00:06:34,670
because their their faith focusing more

135
00:06:34,670 --> 00:06:36,620
on the features of the pen than the

136
00:06:36,620 --> 00:06:38,720
benefits and that's something that we

137
00:06:38,720 --> 00:06:42,080
often have in IT so here's a case that

138
00:06:42,080 --> 00:06:45,890
you might recognize there's a CIO and

139
00:06:45,890 --> 00:06:48,200
this on the left hand side here and the

140
00:06:48,200 --> 00:06:50,270
speaking with the CEO and he's trying to

141
00:06:50,270 --> 00:06:52,250
get funding for a DevOps improvement

142
00:06:52,250 --> 00:06:54,530
initiative because we know DevOps is

143
00:06:54,530 --> 00:06:57,920
serious but before he could make

144
00:06:57,920 --> 00:07:02,810
his case the CEO interjects and says now

145
00:07:02,810 --> 00:07:04,760
why should we be investing in this

146
00:07:04,760 --> 00:07:06,580
DevOps instead of in other things like

147
00:07:06,580 --> 00:07:10,400
like acquisitions for instance and the

148
00:07:10,400 --> 00:07:12,860
only thing the poor for CIO can come up

149
00:07:12,860 --> 00:07:14,900
with this is nonsense like continuous

150
00:07:14,900 --> 00:07:18,170
containers immutable micro services and

151
00:07:18,170 --> 00:07:20,840
culture as code which of course is

152
00:07:20,840 --> 00:07:24,080
complete techno babble so we get sent

153
00:07:24,080 --> 00:07:25,820
away and he says come back when you when

154
00:07:25,820 --> 00:07:29,330
you learn to speak my language I hope to

155
00:07:29,330 --> 00:07:32,600
cut a long story short because I could

156
00:07:32,600 --> 00:07:34,340
spend quite a while talking about this

157
00:07:34,340 --> 00:07:36,710
this topic and if in fact I wrote that

158
00:07:36,710 --> 00:07:38,540
paper on the right hand side the

159
00:07:38,540 --> 00:07:41,330
business value of DevOps for Dazza I'm

160
00:07:41,330 --> 00:07:43,100
quite pleased with how that came out

161
00:07:43,100 --> 00:07:47,270
but the various sources on this topic it

162
00:07:47,270 --> 00:07:50,300
tended to say it's about faster delivery

163
00:07:50,300 --> 00:07:53,419
of more resilient and cheap IT with a

164
00:07:53,419 --> 00:07:55,010
happier workforce I don't think you'll

165
00:07:55,010 --> 00:07:57,680
have much argument about her about those

166
00:07:57,680 --> 00:08:01,280
terms but there's still IT term so how

167
00:08:01,280 --> 00:08:03,230
do you translate that into into business

168
00:08:03,230 --> 00:08:06,440
terminology well let's take a look at

169
00:08:06,440 --> 00:08:09,410
faster IT services you don't say that

170
00:08:09,410 --> 00:08:11,660
you say a quicker time to market quicker

171
00:08:11,660 --> 00:08:14,270
time to customer which of course

172
00:08:14,270 --> 00:08:16,730
generates more sales because you get

173
00:08:16,730 --> 00:08:20,090
into the market earlier what quicker

174
00:08:20,090 --> 00:08:21,890
business change if it's an internal

175
00:08:21,890 --> 00:08:25,669
initiative you don't talk about more

176
00:08:25,669 --> 00:08:28,730
resilient IT services but instead you

177
00:08:28,730 --> 00:08:31,010
talk about fewer costly disruptions to

178
00:08:31,010 --> 00:08:33,979
business operations you talk about

179
00:08:33,979 --> 00:08:37,370
better customer experience which leads

180
00:08:37,370 --> 00:08:39,710
of course to more satisfied customers

181
00:08:39,710 --> 00:08:42,770
that become more loyal customers the

182
00:08:42,770 --> 00:08:44,300
loyal customers

183
00:08:44,300 --> 00:08:46,550
are prepared to pay a higher price for

184
00:08:46,550 --> 00:08:48,560
your products and services because they

185
00:08:48,560 --> 00:08:51,230
value you so that so suddenly we've

186
00:08:51,230 --> 00:08:53,930
maybe made the switch from resilience to

187
00:08:53,930 --> 00:08:56,270
higher prices which is quite so quite

188
00:08:56,270 --> 00:09:00,530
significant now don't talk about cheap

189
00:09:00,530 --> 00:09:02,930
IT services but expressed in terms of

190
00:09:02,930 --> 00:09:04,790
capital expenditure and operational

191
00:09:04,790 --> 00:09:08,270
expenditure but ask yourself the

192
00:09:08,270 --> 00:09:10,220
question first whether you should be

193
00:09:10,220 --> 00:09:13,700
talking about IT costs because sometimes

194
00:09:13,700 --> 00:09:17,120
IT costs are just a fraction of total

195
00:09:17,120 --> 00:09:20,780
business costs and aren't really high on

196
00:09:20,780 --> 00:09:23,570
the agenda of the CEO so try and

197
00:09:23,570 --> 00:09:25,250
discover how what proportion of your

198
00:09:25,250 --> 00:09:28,910
costs are related to IT that's quite an

199
00:09:28,910 --> 00:09:30,470
interesting exercise and not many people

200
00:09:30,470 --> 00:09:33,830
know it and finally whatever you do

201
00:09:33,830 --> 00:09:36,860
don't talk about happier IT people it's

202
00:09:36,860 --> 00:09:38,750
bad enough that you have them talk

203
00:09:38,750 --> 00:09:40,390
instead about high performance

204
00:09:40,390 --> 00:09:42,800
organizations because that's the kind of

205
00:09:42,800 --> 00:09:45,650
language that will appeal to the CEO

206
00:09:45,650 --> 00:09:47,990
then we'll get you the funding because

207
00:09:47,990 --> 00:09:49,340
you fix you haven't you you're not doing

208
00:09:49,340 --> 00:09:51,320
anything different you've just expressed

209
00:09:51,320 --> 00:09:54,500
it in a different way so think along

210
00:09:54,500 --> 00:09:57,310
those lines find that very interesting

211
00:09:57,310 --> 00:10:02,570
myself moving from the business

212
00:10:02,570 --> 00:10:05,120
perspective to the employee perspective

213
00:10:05,120 --> 00:10:07,210
you see in this diagram here

214
00:10:07,210 --> 00:10:10,580
organizations co-create value with and

215
00:10:10,580 --> 00:10:15,200
for many parties we just explore the

216
00:10:15,200 --> 00:10:17,540
shareholder axis the business value and

217
00:10:17,540 --> 00:10:21,520
are now looking at the employee access

218
00:10:21,520 --> 00:10:23,900
thinking about an employee experience

219
00:10:23,900 --> 00:10:27,500
what's um what's a meaningful and

220
00:10:27,500 --> 00:10:35,459
rewarding employee experience and

221
00:10:35,459 --> 00:10:36,889
I've been thinking about recently is

222
00:10:36,889 --> 00:10:41,279
when you aren't talking about money

223
00:10:41,279 --> 00:10:44,749
anymore you move into the area of

224
00:10:44,749 --> 00:10:47,610
fulfillment of aspirations it's a bit

225
00:10:47,610 --> 00:10:50,009
like the mass loft period a pyramid in a

226
00:10:50,009 --> 00:10:53,459
sense you can read them for yourself but

227
00:10:53,459 --> 00:10:56,519
I'll just give a voice over to a couple

228
00:10:56,519 --> 00:10:58,920
of them help them get customers jobs

229
00:10:58,920 --> 00:11:02,579
done I think is the crucial arm it's

230
00:11:02,579 --> 00:11:05,850
really when you think about it we many

231
00:11:05,850 --> 00:11:09,209
of us have the privilege of contributing

232
00:11:09,209 --> 00:11:12,259
to the well-being and prosperity of

233
00:11:12,259 --> 00:11:16,319
digital service consumers and that is

234
00:11:16,319 --> 00:11:17,779
you know it's a great source of

235
00:11:17,779 --> 00:11:20,100
satisfaction that you're doing something

236
00:11:20,100 --> 00:11:22,050
meaningful I think that's a sense of

237
00:11:22,050 --> 00:11:22,649
purpose

238
00:11:22,649 --> 00:11:26,429
you might recall 10 Pink's autonomy

239
00:11:26,429 --> 00:11:28,800
mastery and purpose which I think makes

240
00:11:28,800 --> 00:11:31,800
good sense that's really the key thing

241
00:11:31,800 --> 00:11:35,939
for me but also being able to trust and

242
00:11:35,939 --> 00:11:38,819
be trusted in an organization and the

243
00:11:38,819 --> 00:11:42,119
last one I'll highlight is working in

244
00:11:42,119 --> 00:11:44,670
complex environments where things are

245
00:11:44,670 --> 00:11:47,970
ambiguous and uncertain just recognizing

246
00:11:47,970 --> 00:11:50,970
that and dealing with it I think they

247
00:11:50,970 --> 00:11:53,220
they are that they are if you can

248
00:11:53,220 --> 00:11:55,709
fulfill these kind of aspirations you've

249
00:11:55,709 --> 00:11:58,040
got a pretty decent employee experience

250
00:11:58,040 --> 00:12:01,110
now it was interesting awhile ago I was

251
00:12:01,110 --> 00:12:03,809
asked to review gene Kim's new book the

252
00:12:03,809 --> 00:12:07,379
unicorn project I think I wrote a little

253
00:12:07,379 --> 00:12:10,529
article on LinkedIn the called the fina

254
00:12:10,529 --> 00:12:13,649
corn project because the unicorn project

255
00:12:13,649 --> 00:12:15,209
is certain this equals the Phoenix

256
00:12:15,209 --> 00:12:18,929
project and he talks about the five

257
00:12:18,929 --> 00:12:22,980
ideals in the unicorn project depicted

258
00:12:22,980 --> 00:12:26,339
them here in orange and I saw pretty

259
00:12:26,339 --> 00:12:29,069
quickly that there was there was a great

260
00:12:29,069 --> 00:12:31,559
similarity with the five aspirations

261
00:12:31,559 --> 00:12:33,600
that I was developing in a parallel

262
00:12:33,600 --> 00:12:34,410
universe

263
00:12:34,410 --> 00:12:37,559
when I was writing my book so it was

264
00:12:37,559 --> 00:12:40,410
somewhat reassuring that that these are

265
00:12:40,410 --> 00:12:42,029
the kind of things that people like us

266
00:12:42,029 --> 00:12:44,999
seemed to value how that was quite neat

267
00:12:44,999 --> 00:12:46,660
and at this cron

268
00:12:46,660 --> 00:12:50,080
gene is doing his own talk on the on

269
00:12:50,080 --> 00:12:52,210
five values so I certainly encourage you

270
00:12:52,210 --> 00:12:57,550
to to attend that as well thanks for

271
00:12:57,550 --> 00:13:00,610
attending this one by the way final

272
00:13:00,610 --> 00:13:04,120
comments on values some organizations

273
00:13:04,120 --> 00:13:07,240
tend to impose their corporate values on

274
00:13:07,240 --> 00:13:11,230
their employees when you think about it

275
00:13:11,230 --> 00:13:14,200
it might even be morally dubious whether

276
00:13:14,200 --> 00:13:16,690
you should do that impose values on

277
00:13:16,690 --> 00:13:19,630
individuals and I think it's not very

278
00:13:19,630 --> 00:13:21,940
affected either because if everybody

279
00:13:21,940 --> 00:13:23,530
thinks the same way you're going to get

280
00:13:23,530 --> 00:13:24,390
groupthink

281
00:13:24,390 --> 00:13:29,260
which is notoriously ineffective do you

282
00:13:29,260 --> 00:13:31,210
need diversity but you don't you don't

283
00:13:31,210 --> 00:13:33,100
want too much diversity because on the

284
00:13:33,100 --> 00:13:34,660
other end of the spectrum if people are

285
00:13:34,660 --> 00:13:36,520
constantly arguing with each other

286
00:13:36,520 --> 00:13:40,300
negotiating the differences in in values

287
00:13:40,300 --> 00:13:42,610
in beliefs in opinions then that's not

288
00:13:42,610 --> 00:13:44,740
very productive either so you want

289
00:13:44,740 --> 00:13:46,390
something in the middle and I like to

290
00:13:46,390 --> 00:13:49,510
call it coherent diversity enough

291
00:13:49,510 --> 00:13:55,240
diversity to generate new ideas but not

292
00:13:55,240 --> 00:13:58,030
enough to make it unproductive because

293
00:13:58,030 --> 00:13:59,250
you're having too many arguments

294
00:13:59,250 --> 00:14:03,370
coherent diversity and a bit on the

295
00:14:03,370 --> 00:14:07,270
theme of evolution and then on us we

296
00:14:07,270 --> 00:14:09,250
like to stick to our kind of people but

297
00:14:09,250 --> 00:14:11,680
if we do that too much far from that

298
00:14:11,680 --> 00:14:14,440
group thing you you know you you you in

299
00:14:14,440 --> 00:14:16,240
breed and you go extinct on an

300
00:14:16,240 --> 00:14:20,650
evolutionary axis so you need those

301
00:14:20,650 --> 00:14:22,900
strangers at them and ask you need the

302
00:14:22,900 --> 00:14:25,270
strangers if we need a bit of them for

303
00:14:25,270 --> 00:14:28,750
us to become a better us which I thought

304
00:14:28,750 --> 00:14:30,820
was a quite quite a nice way of putting

305
00:14:30,820 --> 00:14:32,500
it so if you like to tweak that to feel

306
00:14:32,500 --> 00:14:35,770
free final comments here is delightful

307
00:14:35,770 --> 00:14:38,020
to see that organizations are being more

308
00:14:38,020 --> 00:14:40,690
mindful of the need for psychological

309
00:14:40,690 --> 00:14:43,750
safety in the workplace and being

310
00:14:43,750 --> 00:14:47,410
attentive to stress levels psychological

311
00:14:47,410 --> 00:14:50,680
safety is when you feel able to express

312
00:14:50,680 --> 00:14:53,470
yourself without fear for your

313
00:14:53,470 --> 00:14:56,860
reputation or your position and as far

314
00:14:56,860 --> 00:14:58,330
as stress is concerned again it's

315
00:14:58,330 --> 00:15:01,470
balance like with

316
00:15:01,600 --> 00:15:04,220
you need enough resilience to deal with

317
00:15:04,220 --> 00:15:06,079
the the functional tension that you

318
00:15:06,079 --> 00:15:08,089
always have in organizations and you

319
00:15:08,089 --> 00:15:09,980
know things happen sometimes you have to

320
00:15:09,980 --> 00:15:12,649
things escalate a bit have to be able to

321
00:15:12,649 --> 00:15:14,509
deal with that but if the stress is

322
00:15:14,509 --> 00:15:17,300
constantly at an unhealthy level that is

323
00:15:17,300 --> 00:15:20,980
not acceptable as dr. Christina Maslach

324
00:15:20,980 --> 00:15:25,009
who's specialized in burnout says we

325
00:15:25,009 --> 00:15:28,579
need less toxic workplaces not more

326
00:15:28,579 --> 00:15:31,129
resilient Canaries which is a great

327
00:15:31,129 --> 00:15:34,249
another thing you can quote not from me

328
00:15:34,249 --> 00:15:39,769
but from her third topic velocity if you

329
00:15:39,769 --> 00:15:41,329
have a bit of a scientific background

330
00:15:41,329 --> 00:15:43,309
you might recall that velocity is not

331
00:15:43,309 --> 00:15:45,170
only about speed but also about

332
00:15:45,170 --> 00:15:47,930
direction if you translate that into the

333
00:15:47,930 --> 00:15:49,550
organizational context that we're

334
00:15:49,550 --> 00:15:51,290
speaking about now that's about doing

335
00:15:51,290 --> 00:15:55,550
the right thing quickly and it's it's a

336
00:15:55,550 --> 00:15:56,389
balancing act

337
00:15:56,389 --> 00:15:58,910
it's the you might might have seen this

338
00:15:58,910 --> 00:16:02,149
sign we have three kinds of service good

339
00:16:02,149 --> 00:16:05,120
cheap and fast you can pick any two it's

340
00:16:05,120 --> 00:16:09,379
a bit like the the Iron Triangle that

341
00:16:09,379 --> 00:16:11,379
that you come across quite often

342
00:16:11,379 --> 00:16:14,689
balancing between these these aspects

343
00:16:14,689 --> 00:16:18,379
and crucially it's a dynamic balancing

344
00:16:18,379 --> 00:16:21,439
act because things changed often on a

345
00:16:21,439 --> 00:16:23,120
daily basis you know things happen you

346
00:16:23,120 --> 00:16:27,500
have to react quickly either to deal

347
00:16:27,500 --> 00:16:30,470
with an incident or grasp on market

348
00:16:30,470 --> 00:16:32,120
opportunity which means you have to act

349
00:16:32,120 --> 00:16:34,579
quickly which means that you might take

350
00:16:34,579 --> 00:16:36,970
short cuts resulting in technical debt

351
00:16:36,970 --> 00:16:40,089
now that isn't necessarily a bad thing

352
00:16:40,089 --> 00:16:43,040
as long as you are willing and able to

353
00:16:43,040 --> 00:16:45,860
pay the interest on the debt which

354
00:16:45,860 --> 00:16:48,589
manifests itself in the form of

355
00:16:48,589 --> 00:16:51,589
incidents that occur you get collateral

356
00:16:51,589 --> 00:16:54,139
damage and have to deal with that repair

357
00:16:54,139 --> 00:16:57,589
they repair the damage but also it

358
00:16:57,589 --> 00:16:59,449
manifests itself as in inefficiencies

359
00:16:59,449 --> 00:17:01,639
because the next time you want to change

360
00:17:01,639 --> 00:17:03,679
the software that's been badly coded

361
00:17:03,679 --> 00:17:06,919
it's going to take you more time now if

362
00:17:06,919 --> 00:17:08,839
you're happy to pay that interest

363
00:17:08,839 --> 00:17:11,089
there's nothing bad with having having

364
00:17:11,089 --> 00:17:12,839
debt

365
00:17:12,839 --> 00:17:14,940
but you probably need to repay it from

366
00:17:14,940 --> 00:17:16,410
time to time to get it down to an

367
00:17:16,410 --> 00:17:18,990
acceptable level which means refactoring

368
00:17:18,990 --> 00:17:20,900
software and stuff like that

369
00:17:20,900 --> 00:17:25,260
so pay attention to technical debt get

370
00:17:25,260 --> 00:17:28,470
it to an acceptable level final point

371
00:17:28,470 --> 00:17:30,450
here doing the right thing often implies

372
00:17:30,450 --> 00:17:33,600
that the organization acts beyond its

373
00:17:33,600 --> 00:17:36,870
direct economic interests which is a

374
00:17:36,870 --> 00:17:38,940
nice segue into the final topic about

375
00:17:38,940 --> 00:17:44,190
the virtue or ethics you might recognize

376
00:17:44,190 --> 00:17:47,910
this gentleman here Dave Snowden the guy

377
00:17:47,910 --> 00:17:49,680
who strongly associated with the

378
00:17:49,680 --> 00:17:52,440
Commission since making framework that

379
00:17:52,440 --> 00:17:54,780
I've depicted here I'm not going to talk

380
00:17:54,780 --> 00:17:56,790
about the framework it is in the in both

381
00:17:56,790 --> 00:17:59,970
of the books if you haven't heard of the

382
00:17:59,970 --> 00:18:02,220
Keynesian framework please look it up

383
00:18:02,220 --> 00:18:04,500
it'll give you a headache but it's worth

384
00:18:04,500 --> 00:18:07,800
it now for the first book I wrote I

385
00:18:07,800 --> 00:18:10,260
asked Dave to write a piece about ethics

386
00:18:10,260 --> 00:18:12,410
and it's an absolutely delightful piece

387
00:18:12,410 --> 00:18:16,620
one of the best pieces in the in the

388
00:18:16,620 --> 00:18:20,340
book in fact it's and indeed I'm

389
00:18:20,340 --> 00:18:22,890
summarizing his piece in in some simple

390
00:18:22,890 --> 00:18:25,440
statements technology has an

391
00:18:25,440 --> 00:18:28,110
unprecedented impact on society in the

392
00:18:28,110 --> 00:18:31,890
economy and even to the degree that

393
00:18:31,890 --> 00:18:33,390
lives depend on it

394
00:18:33,390 --> 00:18:35,580
if you think about the the Boeing 737

395
00:18:35,580 --> 00:18:39,510
max tragedy for instance where software

396
00:18:39,510 --> 00:18:42,510
and software engineering seemed to play

397
00:18:42,510 --> 00:18:44,940
a crucial role their lives depend on

398
00:18:44,940 --> 00:18:49,350
this kind of stuff the second statement

399
00:18:49,350 --> 00:18:51,060
is that our actions have unintended

400
00:18:51,060 --> 00:18:53,190
consequences sometimes positive

401
00:18:53,190 --> 00:18:59,070
sometimes negative and that painfully we

402
00:18:59,070 --> 00:19:02,390
are morally responsible for our actions

403
00:19:02,390 --> 00:19:05,310
including the including the consequences

404
00:19:05,310 --> 00:19:08,460
now that means that organizations have

405
00:19:08,460 --> 00:19:13,440
to monitor ethical behavior that really

406
00:19:13,440 --> 00:19:15,780
means that that ethics draws drawing to

407
00:19:15,780 --> 00:19:17,730
the conclusion that ethics belongs in

408
00:19:17,730 --> 00:19:19,920
the core of Education which I don't

409
00:19:19,920 --> 00:19:24,590
think is is he's done to that just for

410
00:19:24,590 --> 00:19:26,659
degree at the moment so that's something

411
00:19:26,659 --> 00:19:29,059
to pay attention to because of course

412
00:19:29,059 --> 00:19:31,220
it's not only about education it's also

413
00:19:31,220 --> 00:19:33,650
about the the values that people have

414
00:19:33,650 --> 00:19:36,200
the character they have which is

415
00:19:36,200 --> 00:19:39,110
partially genetically determined but

416
00:19:39,110 --> 00:19:43,880
also by by their upbringing but whatever

417
00:19:43,880 --> 00:19:48,100
it's um it's a difficult topic this it's

418
00:19:48,100 --> 00:19:51,650
ethical decisions are aren't black or

419
00:19:51,650 --> 00:19:53,570
white this is all you're always

420
00:19:53,570 --> 00:19:56,000
discussing the least worst course of

421
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:58,820
action you have to talk about this stuff

422
00:19:58,820 --> 00:20:00,460
that's the that's the main message here

423
00:20:00,460 --> 00:20:02,990
that this picture by the way was taken

424
00:20:02,990 --> 00:20:05,390
that the 10th that DevOps days in Ghent

425
00:20:05,390 --> 00:20:09,320
in Belgium last year where I organized

426
00:20:09,320 --> 00:20:12,080
an open space for everybody to look

427
00:20:12,080 --> 00:20:15,529
miserable talking about ethics I did a

428
00:20:15,529 --> 00:20:18,740
little write-up on the on the talk

429
00:20:18,740 --> 00:20:21,590
devops days and Obama agreed that it's

430
00:20:21,590 --> 00:20:24,860
messy out there thing that's what messy

431
00:20:24,860 --> 00:20:26,960
characterizes ethical decisions and

432
00:20:26,960 --> 00:20:29,149
didn't did another article as well the

433
00:20:29,149 --> 00:20:32,299
only way is ethics now you find those

434
00:20:32,299 --> 00:20:35,960
easily enough I think so that so this

435
00:20:35,960 --> 00:20:37,730
gives you something to think about so

436
00:20:37,730 --> 00:20:39,950
these these were the topics I run

437
00:20:39,950 --> 00:20:43,820
through pretty quickly I have all

438
00:20:43,820 --> 00:20:47,120
covered in me in the two books to to a

439
00:20:47,120 --> 00:20:49,159
greater degree along with other topics

440
00:20:49,159 --> 00:20:53,179
as well now when I mentioned that this

441
00:20:53,179 --> 00:20:56,149
book the first book is entitled book you

442
00:20:56,149 --> 00:21:00,590
might have the have the idea of throwing

443
00:21:00,590 --> 00:21:03,110
that Rotten Tomatoes don't they but I've

444
00:21:03,110 --> 00:21:05,899
been reassured in the code of conduct of

445
00:21:05,899 --> 00:21:07,610
this conference that there's no

446
00:21:07,610 --> 00:21:10,190
discrimination against people of service

447
00:21:10,190 --> 00:21:14,570
like me so I now feel the love flowing

448
00:21:14,570 --> 00:21:16,730
out to maybe which is very generous of

449
00:21:16,730 --> 00:21:21,289
you must say is it's a weird book it

450
00:21:21,289 --> 00:21:24,380
says I think the weirdest title book

451
00:21:24,380 --> 00:21:28,159
that's ever been published which is why

452
00:21:28,159 --> 00:21:31,010
I let spock say it's I told Jim but not

453
00:21:31,010 --> 00:21:34,010
as we know it it's getting a nice

454
00:21:34,010 --> 00:21:35,740
reception in

455
00:21:35,740 --> 00:21:39,299
the recent DevOps meetup in in Amsterdam

456
00:21:39,299 --> 00:21:42,610
people say nice things about it not you

457
00:21:42,610 --> 00:21:44,860
never thought this was about itíll cool

458
00:21:44,860 --> 00:21:46,870
universal touches the subjects I'm

459
00:21:46,870 --> 00:21:49,179
passionate about that's very very

460
00:21:49,179 --> 00:21:54,940
gratifying so finally now pointing you

461
00:21:54,940 --> 00:21:57,549
in the direction of the book with

462
00:21:57,549 --> 00:22:00,340
discount the book about the book that I

463
00:22:00,340 --> 00:22:02,919
self-published on Amazon which was great

464
00:22:02,919 --> 00:22:06,520
fun can recommend that and some free

465
00:22:06,520 --> 00:22:10,059
content in the weekly excerpts I've just

466
00:22:10,059 --> 00:22:13,360
started putting on a LinkedIn article

467
00:22:13,360 --> 00:22:16,270
here I wrote this that's the name of the

468
00:22:16,270 --> 00:22:18,220
article I think you'll find that easily

469
00:22:18,220 --> 00:22:22,270
enough so I'm leaving you with the with

470
00:22:22,270 --> 00:22:24,580
my belief that this is guidance that

471
00:22:24,580 --> 00:22:30,210
matters for people like us who care

472
00:22:30,210 --> 00:22:36,940
thanks a lot thanks mark for that

473
00:22:36,940 --> 00:22:41,230
presentation it was really nice I see we

474
00:22:41,230 --> 00:22:43,720
have also a question on slack but if you

475
00:22:43,720 --> 00:22:46,720
do if you don't mind I started the

476
00:22:46,720 --> 00:22:50,620
question of my own sure you mentioned

477
00:22:50,620 --> 00:22:54,370
that we as I tears we talk too much and

478
00:22:54,370 --> 00:22:55,899
we talk too much

479
00:22:55,899 --> 00:22:58,870
techno babble when we want to sell our

480
00:22:58,870 --> 00:23:02,590
ID do you think it's getting better over

481
00:23:02,590 --> 00:23:05,340
the years because I've seen this shift

482
00:23:05,340 --> 00:23:10,720
during the last ten years of DevOps it

483
00:23:10,720 --> 00:23:12,190
seems to me it's getting better

484
00:23:12,190 --> 00:23:16,500
otherwise the DevOps ID wouldn't be held

485
00:23:16,500 --> 00:23:20,350
accountable around the table do do you

486
00:23:20,350 --> 00:23:24,940
agree with that yes bill dark no no well

487
00:23:24,940 --> 00:23:26,799
there's always room for improvement but

488
00:23:26,799 --> 00:23:28,600
I I agree we're moving in the right

489
00:23:28,600 --> 00:23:29,409
direction

490
00:23:29,409 --> 00:23:33,360
is interesting by the way slight slight

491
00:23:33,360 --> 00:23:37,510
technical time I've got plenty time five

492
00:23:37,510 --> 00:23:41,730
minute nice nice little little detour

493
00:23:41,730 --> 00:23:45,850
thinking about the how DevOps came about

494
00:23:45,850 --> 00:23:47,800
ten years ago now

495
00:23:47,800 --> 00:23:50,680
and the the fact that the name was was

496
00:23:50,680 --> 00:23:53,710
coined I believe more or less by

497
00:23:53,710 --> 00:23:56,140
accident to give a conference a name we

498
00:23:56,140 --> 00:23:58,060
had to Patrick had to give give the

499
00:23:58,060 --> 00:23:59,800
conference name so it's called DevOps

500
00:23:59,800 --> 00:24:02,020
but I'd be believe he played around with

501
00:24:02,020 --> 00:24:04,080
the with the term agile system

502
00:24:04,080 --> 00:24:07,900
administration around that now if you go

503
00:24:07,900 --> 00:24:10,510
back to agile when they were writing the

504
00:24:10,510 --> 00:24:13,000
agile manifesto back around the turn of

505
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:16,330
the century somebody suggested instead

506
00:24:16,330 --> 00:24:19,710
of the name agile conversational

507
00:24:19,710 --> 00:24:22,540
software development so we could have

508
00:24:22,540 --> 00:24:24,880
been talking about the conversational

509
00:24:24,880 --> 00:24:27,370
software development manifesto and

510
00:24:27,370 --> 00:24:28,900
Patrick could have been talking about

511
00:24:28,900 --> 00:24:31,390
the conversational system administration

512
00:24:31,390 --> 00:24:33,760
but the point the point I wanted to make

513
00:24:33,760 --> 00:24:35,290
was that that their thing about

514
00:24:35,290 --> 00:24:37,870
conversation that is one of I think one

515
00:24:37,870 --> 00:24:41,140
of the key key things that people are

516
00:24:41,140 --> 00:24:42,640
working on getting people closer

517
00:24:42,640 --> 00:24:45,700
together where we often talk in some

518
00:24:45,700 --> 00:24:48,870
circles about business and IT alignment

519
00:24:48,870 --> 00:24:51,130
which implies that there are two

520
00:24:51,130 --> 00:24:54,970
entities that have to be aligned I think

521
00:24:54,970 --> 00:24:56,530
now people are talking more about

522
00:24:56,530 --> 00:25:00,550
convergence of the two entities so we

523
00:25:00,550 --> 00:25:02,350
don't no longer talk about business and

524
00:25:02,350 --> 00:25:04,360
IT as separate organizational entities

525
00:25:04,360 --> 00:25:06,970
but they're part of the same often

526
00:25:06,970 --> 00:25:10,810
product-based team so I think it's I

527
00:25:10,810 --> 00:25:12,610
think we're moving in the right

528
00:25:12,610 --> 00:25:14,290
direction and it's like it's like

529
00:25:14,290 --> 00:25:16,570
somebody said that the future is already

530
00:25:16,570 --> 00:25:21,720
here it's not just evenly distributed so

531
00:25:21,720 --> 00:25:24,160
maybe we'll need to add another ten

532
00:25:24,160 --> 00:25:25,660
years through the DevOps

533
00:25:25,660 --> 00:25:30,120
days movement well you know the thing is

534
00:25:30,120 --> 00:25:32,710
real only recently I realized that I'm

535
00:25:32,710 --> 00:25:36,010
I'm now experiencing my sixth decade in

536
00:25:36,010 --> 00:25:38,200
professional IT because I started off at

537
00:25:38,200 --> 00:25:40,360
the end of the 70s I'd have 70s 80s 90s

538
00:25:40,360 --> 00:25:43,270
now we're in the 20s and I've seen

539
00:25:43,270 --> 00:25:45,040
various movements happened like the

540
00:25:45,040 --> 00:25:47,110
first project project management

541
00:25:47,110 --> 00:25:49,030
movement in the 70s 80s when we were

542
00:25:49,030 --> 00:25:51,490
building systems that ended up in

543
00:25:51,490 --> 00:25:54,130
dictatorship then you had the IT Service

544
00:25:54,130 --> 00:25:57,520
Management movement which ended up in

545
00:25:57,520 --> 00:25:59,470
bureaucracy in some circles then you had

546
00:25:59,470 --> 00:26:01,720
the agile movement which ended up in

547
00:26:01,720 --> 00:26:03,850
in people arguing about how to stick

548
00:26:03,850 --> 00:26:07,539
post-it notes on the board and so be

549
00:26:07,539 --> 00:26:10,210
interesting to look in look back in 10

550
00:26:10,210 --> 00:26:14,289
years time and see see these things

551
00:26:14,289 --> 00:26:16,990
always go wrong in the end they always

552
00:26:16,990 --> 00:26:19,899
end up end up in tears there's always

553
00:26:19,899 --> 00:26:22,840
the new idea we have a questioner on

554
00:26:22,840 --> 00:26:27,330
flex rubber Chris Conte he quotes you

555
00:26:27,330 --> 00:26:30,789
immoral to impose corporate values on

556
00:26:30,789 --> 00:26:35,259
people so and he says he asks what his

557
00:26:35,259 --> 00:26:36,909
company values were defined by a

558
00:26:36,909 --> 00:26:38,679
committee of Spears and does that

559
00:26:38,679 --> 00:26:41,500
support coherent diversity or still

560
00:26:41,500 --> 00:26:43,090
promote groupthink

561
00:26:43,090 --> 00:26:46,179
actually I also wrote this down as a as

562
00:26:46,179 --> 00:26:50,919
like a possible question like you see

563
00:26:50,919 --> 00:26:54,220
all these startups also like divining

564
00:26:54,220 --> 00:26:58,360
their their values it's like you can't

565
00:26:58,360 --> 00:27:00,610
find the startup without any any values

566
00:27:00,610 --> 00:27:03,970
but then what does it really mean so but

567
00:27:03,970 --> 00:27:06,399
maybe first comments on a grid is the

568
00:27:06,399 --> 00:27:08,830
question so or whether the committee of

569
00:27:08,830 --> 00:27:09,570
peers

570
00:27:09,570 --> 00:27:12,460
yeah I think if the if the committee of

571
00:27:12,460 --> 00:27:15,580
peers is as a good distribution across

572
00:27:15,580 --> 00:27:17,259
the company that you don't have group

573
00:27:17,259 --> 00:27:20,159
you know so it represents various

574
00:27:20,159 --> 00:27:24,129
opinions I think that's pretty good the

575
00:27:24,129 --> 00:27:25,779
thing you got to watch out for and we

576
00:27:25,779 --> 00:27:27,460
could you know if we if we had to start

577
00:27:27,460 --> 00:27:29,110
up just the two of us we could agree on

578
00:27:29,110 --> 00:27:32,440
stuff but if we just keep to our own

579
00:27:32,440 --> 00:27:36,929
little circle will will start inbreeding

580
00:27:36,929 --> 00:27:39,370
cognitively I hope just cognitively

581
00:27:39,370 --> 00:27:42,789
inbreeding and go extinct so we need

582
00:27:42,789 --> 00:27:45,820
diversity we need that's the paradox of

583
00:27:45,820 --> 00:27:48,250
a paradoxical thing about life we need

584
00:27:48,250 --> 00:27:50,379
to mingle with strangers who we don't

585
00:27:50,379 --> 00:27:53,950
like by definition in order to survive

586
00:27:53,950 --> 00:27:55,840
on the longer term so we need to

587
00:27:55,840 --> 00:27:58,210
strengthen the gene pool I think that

588
00:27:58,210 --> 00:27:59,740
just playing around with that topic of

589
00:27:59,740 --> 00:28:02,259
values being aware of the values that

590
00:28:02,259 --> 00:28:07,299
you have and having strong opinions but

591
00:28:07,299 --> 00:28:10,570
holding them weekly so being prepared to

592
00:28:10,570 --> 00:28:12,929
revise the opinions that you have I

593
00:28:12,929 --> 00:28:15,010
think and I think that's

594
00:28:15,010 --> 00:28:16,660
that's the basis of the scientific

595
00:28:16,660 --> 00:28:19,540
method anyway believing in something in

596
00:28:19,540 --> 00:28:22,210
the hypothesis until you discover

597
00:28:22,210 --> 00:28:25,500
there's better the better hypothesis

598
00:28:25,500 --> 00:28:29,020
okay thank you and that unfortunately

599
00:28:29,020 --> 00:28:33,370
wraps up our time it's time for a break

600
00:28:33,370 --> 00:28:35,980
now thank you for your time art may be

601
00:28:35,980 --> 00:28:37,960
honored question where are you located

602
00:28:37,960 --> 00:28:40,990
I know you're worried then yeah just

603

outside Amsterdam roughly or live in the

604
00:28:44,380 --> 00:28:45,970
Netherlands lived in your Netherlands
