Werner and we are talking a health and

3
00:00:09,450 --> 00:00:12,809
eat government security with Java so

4
00:00:12,809 --> 00:00:16,190
this has me intrigued to say the least

5
00:00:16,190 --> 00:00:23,400
so guys thanks for joining us the doors

livestream we're gonna talk about say

23
00:01:17,430 --> 00:01:19,680
during a health and eat government with

24
00:01:19,680 --> 00:01:23,150
Java right but first of all let's meet

25
00:01:23,150 --> 00:01:28,170
Lerner who are you yeah I'm Donna Kyle

eclipse kappa éé specification committee

30
00:01:43,369 --> 00:01:45,840
after having done several other things

31
00:01:45,840 --> 00:01:47,520
including the HACCP Executive Committee

32
00:01:47,520 --> 00:01:51,479
for some time okay

33
00:01:51,479 --> 00:01:54,930
hello as well my name is Marie's bias or

motivation in career life via my own

41
00:02:12,690 --> 00:02:13,710
company

42
00:02:13,710 --> 00:02:17,100
leaders enough about us that have a

43
00:02:17,100 --> 00:02:21,330
short look at the agenda for today we're

44
00:02:21,330 --> 00:02:23,720
gonna talk I'm gonna walk you through

45
00:02:23,720 --> 00:02:26,160
the definition story health and in

46
00:02:26,160 --> 00:02:28,070
government we're gonna talk a bit about

47
00:02:28,070 --> 00:02:31,020
signatures the DSS framework and how

48
00:02:31,020 --> 00:02:33,870
this is standardized across Europe and a

49
00:02:33,870 --> 00:02:37,340
short demo with links and Q&A in the end

50
00:02:37,340 --> 00:02:42,060
so what is a health actually and given

51
00:02:42,060 --> 00:02:44,870
that we are talking about the Health

52
00:02:44,870 --> 00:02:46,020
Organization

53
00:02:46,020 --> 00:02:48,870
it is good to provide a definition from

54
00:02:48,870 --> 00:02:51,870
there as well so when we are talking

55
00:02:51,870 --> 00:02:54,780
about we basically respect to the use of

56
00:02:54,780 --> 00:02:57,210
information and communications

57
00:02:57,210 --> 00:02:59,820
technologies in healthcare quite

58
00:02:59,820 --> 00:03:03,120
straightforward right what about the

59
00:03:03,120 --> 00:03:05,970
government the government is of course

60
00:03:05,970 --> 00:03:08,130
the opening up and adaptation of the

61
00:03:08,130 --> 00:03:10,310
public sector through information and

62
00:03:10,310 --> 00:03:14,430
communication technologies that's pretty

63
00:03:14,430 --> 00:03:15,120
cool right

64
00:03:15,120 --> 00:03:19,890
however one could wonder I could start

65
00:03:19,890 --> 00:03:22,230
wondering at this moment why should we

66
00:03:22,230 --> 00:03:24,990
really use the health for example what

67
00:03:24,990 --> 00:03:28,770
are the benefits nowadays so ah there

68
00:03:28,770 --> 00:03:31,500
are quite some benefits we understand

69
00:03:31,500 --> 00:03:34,290
first of all one of the most important

70
00:03:34,290 --> 00:03:37,320
or the most important stone important

71
00:03:37,320 --> 00:03:40,640
all sorry is the time saving right

72
00:03:40,640 --> 00:03:43,260
patients can now add a schedule their

73
00:03:43,260 --> 00:03:44,910
own appointment with your health care

74
00:03:44,910 --> 00:03:48,780
provider of life there is no need to

75
00:03:48,780 --> 00:03:50,610
leave their home if they can arrange an

76
00:03:50,610 --> 00:03:54,750
online consultation for example by using

77
00:03:54,750 --> 00:03:58,350
a video link right second of all is also

78
00:03:58,350 --> 00:04:01,020
a cool arm we are getting some more

79
00:04:01,020 --> 00:04:03,720
insights into our own health and what

80
00:04:03,720 --> 00:04:05,900
does that actually mean it means that

81
00:04:05,900 --> 00:04:08,490
patients can now they share their data

82
00:04:08,490 --> 00:04:11,100
with a health care provider so that they

83
00:04:11,100 --> 00:04:13,230
do not have to repeatedly relate their

84
00:04:13,230 --> 00:04:16,680
entire medical history and yeah you know

85
00:04:16,680 --> 00:04:18,930
this basically allows the healthcare

86
00:04:18,930 --> 00:04:21,120
provider to work more effectively

87
00:04:21,120 --> 00:04:23,340
determine the right treatment more

88
00:04:23,340 --> 00:04:25,530
quickly and of course to also avoid

89
00:04:25,530 --> 00:04:26,800
mistakes

90
00:04:26,800 --> 00:04:30,789
thus patients can gain more control over

91
00:04:30,789 --> 00:04:33,130
their own health thanks to a greater

92
00:04:33,130 --> 00:04:35,620
understanding in the health situation in

93
00:04:35,620 --> 00:04:40,000
their health situation to benefits so

94
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:43,240
far right we're not done though there is

95
00:04:43,240 --> 00:04:46,900
the most important one of course lower

96
00:04:46,900 --> 00:04:51,160
administrative burden which is one of

97
00:04:51,160 --> 00:04:53,860
the biggest problems over has been one

98
00:04:53,860 --> 00:04:56,669
of the biggest problems or drawbacks of

99
00:04:56,669 --> 00:05:00,509
what we've been used to hearing or

100
00:05:00,509 --> 00:05:04,169
experiencing as health nowadays so

101
00:05:04,169 --> 00:05:07,930
doctors as of now have less paperwork

102
00:05:07,930 --> 00:05:11,050
and can share information securely and

103
00:05:11,050 --> 00:05:12,840
easily with their colleagues

104
00:05:12,840 --> 00:05:17,440
okay so that was about about it more or

105
00:05:17,440 --> 00:05:20,340
less regarding the benefits of health

106
00:05:20,340 --> 00:05:24,729
however I'm quite doubtful at the moment

107
00:05:24,729 --> 00:05:29,500
how could we really transmit documents

108
00:05:29,500 --> 00:05:32,800
securely over some network some internet

109
00:05:32,800 --> 00:05:36,090
network right there are definitely some

110
00:05:36,090 --> 00:05:38,820
requirements for secure transmission as

111
00:05:38,820 --> 00:05:41,759
most of you might already be thinking

112
00:05:41,759 --> 00:05:45,070
what are those requirements first of all

113
00:05:45,070 --> 00:05:47,789
we are talking about integrity right and

114
00:05:47,789 --> 00:05:52,120
by integrity we mean that messages

115
00:05:52,120 --> 00:05:54,460
should not be able to be falsified

116
00:05:54,460 --> 00:05:58,690
unnoticed seventh requirement for secure

117
00:05:58,690 --> 00:06:01,000
transmission is identity we're a

118
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:04,150
measured should be clearly assigned to

119
00:06:04,150 --> 00:06:06,880
the center third one is of course

120
00:06:06,880 --> 00:06:10,479
authenticity where the identity of the

121
00:06:10,479 --> 00:06:13,960
sender should be verifiable and of

122
00:06:13,960 --> 00:06:17,610
course fourth and most important one is

123
00:06:17,610 --> 00:06:22,389
confidentiality where messages should

124
00:06:22,389 --> 00:06:26,699
not be read by unfairest persons okay

125
00:06:26,699 --> 00:06:30,520
four main requirements for secure

126
00:06:30,520 --> 00:06:34,060
transmission so far let's touch a bit

127
00:06:34,060 --> 00:06:38,139
upon of authenticity of both offer but

128
00:06:38,139 --> 00:06:40,569
also of data right

129
00:06:40,569 --> 00:06:42,479
we are definitely talking about

130
00:06:42,479 --> 00:06:45,819
assignment of data to the signer where

131
00:06:45,819 --> 00:06:48,490
we need to have some basic protection

132
00:06:48,490 --> 00:06:51,759
against the denial by signatory but also

133
00:06:51,759 --> 00:06:55,569
against but also some protection of data

134
00:06:55,569 --> 00:06:56,860
against manipulation

135
00:06:56,860 --> 00:06:59,469
what kind of manipulation of the

136
00:06:59,469 --> 00:07:02,289
transmission path but also through the

137
00:07:02,289 --> 00:07:09,580
receiver and I'm pretty sure so far

138
00:07:09,580 --> 00:07:12,429
there are more questions because we are

139
00:07:12,429 --> 00:07:15,309
talking about security so what are the

140
00:07:15,309 --> 00:07:18,279
risks here and the solutions are of

141
00:07:18,279 --> 00:07:21,669
course so one could definitely start

142
00:07:21,669 --> 00:07:25,449
wondering okay you're talking you're

143
00:07:25,449 --> 00:07:29,199
telling us we can transmit or send files

144
00:07:29,199 --> 00:07:32,919
over the network but there are more

145
00:07:32,919 --> 00:07:35,529
questions coming up our way like God who

146
00:07:35,529 --> 00:07:38,169
is my counterpart or who is reading or

147
00:07:38,169 --> 00:07:43,029
has any on changed something well pretty

148
00:07:43,029 --> 00:07:44,499
much understandable but there are

149
00:07:44,499 --> 00:07:47,589
solutions as well the solutions are a

150
00:07:47,589 --> 00:07:52,209
signature and encryption and by that we

151
00:07:52,209 --> 00:07:54,279
mean that first of all unauthorized

152
00:07:54,279 --> 00:07:57,219
parties cannot read an encrypted message

153
00:07:57,219 --> 00:08:00,759
second of all electronically signed

154
00:08:00,759 --> 00:08:04,389
documents cannot be changed unnoticed as

155
00:08:04,389 --> 00:08:07,539
we said neither during transmission nor

156
00:08:07,539 --> 00:08:09,869
throughout the receiver and third of all

157
00:08:09,869 --> 00:08:14,139
that sender cannot deny text for example

158
00:08:14,139 --> 00:08:19,360
a via a binding Hoffler so are we

159
00:08:19,360 --> 00:08:21,519
already talking about electronic

160
00:08:21,519 --> 00:08:24,639
signatures is it isn't there already a

161
00:08:24,639 --> 00:08:27,879
need to have some basic signature while

162
00:08:27,879 --> 00:08:30,509
transmitting a document over the network

163
00:08:30,509 --> 00:08:33,729
yes we are talking about electronic

164
00:08:33,729 --> 00:08:35,828
signatures and what is the functionality

165
00:08:35,828 --> 00:08:38,169
of an electronic signature

166
00:08:38,169 --> 00:08:41,679
first of all an electronic signature is

167
00:08:41,679 --> 00:08:44,589
a cryptographic method that uses to a

168
00:08:44,589 --> 00:08:46,509
symmetric keys as we know them from

169
00:08:46,509 --> 00:08:50,110
cryptography a private key and the

170
00:08:50,110 --> 00:08:52,449
public key of course what about those

171
00:08:52,449 --> 00:08:53,250
two

172
00:08:53,250 --> 00:08:55,740
different kinds of kids first of all

173
00:08:55,740 --> 00:08:58,710
first of all the private key to be kept

174
00:08:58,710 --> 00:09:01,410
secret is used to encrypt the hash value

175
00:09:01,410 --> 00:09:04,890
of the document and by hash value of the

176
00:09:04,890 --> 00:09:06,900
document we basically mean the

177
00:09:06,900 --> 00:09:10,680
compressed text consisting of a sequence

178
00:09:10,680 --> 00:09:14,610
of binary values okay that's cool what

179
00:09:14,610 --> 00:09:17,370
about the public key the public key can

180
00:09:17,370 --> 00:09:19,740
only be used for decryption and much is

181
00:09:19,740 --> 00:09:23,780
only one private key it can be publicly

182
00:09:23,780 --> 00:09:27,090
retrieved and is often sent with the

183
00:09:27,090 --> 00:09:30,600
measures okay cool so private is to be

184
00:09:30,600 --> 00:09:34,200
kept secret and public key knowledge is

185
00:09:34,200 --> 00:09:36,330
used for encryption and March is only

186
00:09:36,330 --> 00:09:40,710
one private key let's have a short look

187
00:09:40,710 --> 00:09:44,220
at this semantic right which is

188
00:09:44,220 --> 00:09:47,850
basically walking us through a sample of

189
00:09:47,850 --> 00:09:49,710
a signature process so what do we have

190
00:09:49,710 --> 00:09:53,700
here I can see a document I can see a

191
00:09:53,700 --> 00:09:56,490
signer and I can also see a verifier and

192
00:09:56,490 --> 00:09:58,950
a network of course which is the basic

193
00:09:58,950 --> 00:09:59,940
requirements right

194
00:09:59,940 --> 00:10:06,300
so from top left to right bottom let me

195
00:10:06,300 --> 00:10:09,839
walk you through this a signer has some

196
00:10:09,839 --> 00:10:13,800
basic document consisting of data right

197
00:10:13,800 --> 00:10:18,300
so the huge the signer uses the hash

198
00:10:18,300 --> 00:10:22,050
algorithm to create a hash value which

199
00:10:22,050 --> 00:10:27,589
is then used via an a private key to be

200
00:10:27,589 --> 00:10:30,560
encrypting to encrypt the document so

201
00:10:30,560 --> 00:10:34,440
after using a hash algorithm we create a

202
00:10:34,440 --> 00:10:37,230
hash and on top of the hash we encrypt

203
00:10:37,230 --> 00:10:40,170
the hash using the private key once or

204
00:10:40,170 --> 00:10:43,050
the result of this encryption is called

205
00:10:43,050 --> 00:10:47,160
a digitally signed document okay cool so

206
00:10:47,160 --> 00:10:50,880
we have the hash we encrypt the house we

207
00:10:50,880 --> 00:10:53,220
using the private key and that results

208
00:10:53,220 --> 00:10:55,830
in a digitally signed document how are

209
00:10:55,830 --> 00:10:57,839
we able to transmit that securely over

210
00:10:57,839 --> 00:11:01,200
the network so basically as you can see

211
00:11:01,200 --> 00:11:03,810
we send this over the network and once

212
00:11:03,810 --> 00:11:07,170
this has arrived to the very fires

213
00:11:07,170 --> 00:11:10,910
and basically they need to do two things

214
00:11:10,910 --> 00:11:14,790
use the hassleberry from the verifiers

215
00:11:14,790 --> 00:11:17,910
and to produce or to generate the hash

216
00:11:17,910 --> 00:11:22,529
value and then also use a poly key for

217
00:11:22,529 --> 00:11:26,549
decryption to generate one more hash

218
00:11:26,549 --> 00:11:29,579
value in the end those two hash values

219
00:11:29,579 --> 00:11:35,399
should match in order to realize a valid

220
00:11:35,399 --> 00:11:39,029
signature otherwise the document is not

221
00:11:39,029 --> 00:11:39,799
secure

222
00:11:39,799 --> 00:11:44,279
well that would build our so far about

223
00:11:44,279 --> 00:11:47,399
the signature process and of course

224
00:11:47,399 --> 00:11:50,759
Vernor is gonna walk you through the

225
00:11:50,759 --> 00:11:52,129
signature types

226
00:11:52,129 --> 00:12:01,769
Vernor I will stop sharing okay can you

227
00:12:01,769 --> 00:12:06,600
see my screen yes yes so the signature

228
00:12:06,600 --> 00:12:10,769
types there are four signature types one

229
00:12:10,769 --> 00:12:12,299
is the simple electronic signature that

230
00:12:12,299 --> 00:12:16,199
you might know from signing things in

231
00:12:16,199 --> 00:12:19,079
your email for example then there's

232
00:12:19,079 --> 00:12:22,589
advanced electronic signature and on top

233
00:12:22,589 --> 00:12:23,759
of that there is the qualified

234
00:12:23,759 --> 00:12:27,290
electronic signature and there's another

235
00:12:27,290 --> 00:12:30,899
layer of security which is the qualified

236
00:12:30,899 --> 00:12:32,819
electronic signature which will provide

237
00:12:32,819 --> 00:12:35,220
an accreditation we will briefly see

238
00:12:35,220 --> 00:12:37,709
that in the DSS demo app what it is but

239
00:12:37,709 --> 00:12:40,230
it basically means that there is a trust

240
00:12:40,230 --> 00:12:44,480
Center that guarantees that the

241
00:12:44,480 --> 00:12:49,019
certificate used to sign it is authentic

242
00:12:49,019 --> 00:12:53,519
and has not been altered with so here

243
00:12:53,519 --> 00:12:56,249
you see the level of security obviously

244
00:12:56,249 --> 00:12:59,069
from simple which is a relatively low

245
00:12:59,069 --> 00:13:02,100
level but usually enough for basic

246
00:13:02,100 --> 00:13:06,379
things like sending emails to qualified

247
00:13:06,379 --> 00:13:08,819
which is necessary especially when you

248
00:13:08,819 --> 00:13:12,119
communicate with your bank or with your

249
00:13:12,119 --> 00:13:15,269
text office or also when health care

250
00:13:15,269 --> 00:13:17,339
providers which obviously nowadays is

251
00:13:17,339 --> 00:13:20,850
also a important thing exchange

252
00:13:20,850 --> 00:13:25,889
data over the Internet the advanced

253
00:13:25,889 --> 00:13:28,709
electronic signature has an owner that

254
00:13:28,709 --> 00:13:31,050
can be uniquely identified and assigned

255
00:13:31,050 --> 00:13:33,870
to that signature the signature is

256
00:13:33,870 --> 00:13:36,060
generated by the means which only can

257
00:13:36,060 --> 00:13:38,940
keep under their own control and it's

258
00:13:38,940 --> 00:13:42,389
capable of identifying that the data has

259
00:13:42,389 --> 00:13:45,290
not changed after the message was signed

260
00:13:45,290 --> 00:13:49,860
and at the later point the signature can

261
00:13:49,860 --> 00:13:52,170
also be invalidated for example after a

262
00:13:52,170 --> 00:13:53,850
certain time when it's no longer

263
00:13:53,850 --> 00:13:59,069
supposed to be valid the scope of an

264
00:13:59,069 --> 00:14:01,500
advanced electronic signature can be

265
00:14:01,500 --> 00:14:05,130
either a company but the signature

266
00:14:05,130 --> 00:14:07,800
holder can also be a service or an

267
00:14:07,800 --> 00:14:11,310
individual therefore the advanced

268
00:14:11,310 --> 00:14:13,019
electronic signature can be used to sign

269
00:14:13,019 --> 00:14:16,730
documents for your own personal needs

270
00:14:16,730 --> 00:14:20,970
for example your text declarations or

271
00:14:20,970 --> 00:14:24,899
other things with a government but it

272
00:14:24,899 --> 00:14:27,509
can also be a functional signature

273
00:14:27,509 --> 00:14:32,120
that's used for invoicing for example

274
00:14:32,120 --> 00:14:35,100
when an application or bot generates

275
00:14:35,100 --> 00:14:39,509
those signatures the qualified

276
00:14:39,509 --> 00:14:42,000
electronic signature has several

277
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:46,529
additional attributes it has a serial

278
00:14:46,529 --> 00:14:50,310
number it is a reference to the

279
00:14:50,310 --> 00:14:52,920
qualified certificate the name of the

280
00:14:52,920 --> 00:14:57,229
owner which is usually a natural person

281
00:14:57,680 --> 00:14:59,819
then the signature verification is

282
00:14:59,819 --> 00:15:02,540
necessary a period how long it is valid

283
00:15:02,540 --> 00:15:05,370
the certification service that issued

284
00:15:05,370 --> 00:15:08,009
the certificate and any possible usage

285
00:15:08,009 --> 00:15:10,170
restrictions for example the qualified

286
00:15:10,170 --> 00:15:11,699
electronic signature may only be valid

287
00:15:11,699 --> 00:15:13,920
in a certain country or a particular

288
00:15:13,920 --> 00:15:17,610
area it's a little bit like what you may

289
00:15:17,610 --> 00:15:20,100
remember from DVDs that were only valid

290
00:15:20,100 --> 00:15:25,290
in particular countries if you have a

291
00:15:25,290 --> 00:15:28,860
trust Center then you have the highest

292
00:15:28,860 --> 00:15:31,230
level which is to qualify the electronic

293
00:15:31,230 --> 00:15:35,040
signature with accreditation by a trust

294
00:15:35,040 --> 00:15:38,399
Center in this case the certificate

295
00:15:38,399 --> 00:15:42,149
providers also have to be compliant and

296
00:15:42,149 --> 00:15:47,420
they have to be verified in their

297
00:15:47,420 --> 00:15:50,870
countries to be trusted

298
00:15:50,870 --> 00:15:54,540
so in Germany for example the bathroom

299
00:15:54,540 --> 00:15:58,680
would be such an place where banking

300
00:15:58,680 --> 00:16:00,630
service providers and financial service

301
00:16:00,630 --> 00:16:06,440
providers have to register their

302
00:16:06,440 --> 00:16:09,029
certificates in order to take place in

303
00:16:09,029 --> 00:16:14,750
PSC to compliant financial transactions

304
00:16:15,199 --> 00:16:21,600
what are certificates a certificate is

305
00:16:21,600 --> 00:16:25,949
basically an electronic document linking

306
00:16:25,949 --> 00:16:28,079
the public signature verification key to

307
00:16:28,079 --> 00:16:29,579
the name of a holder which can either be

308
00:16:29,579 --> 00:16:32,910
a natural or a legal person the most

309
00:16:32,910 --> 00:16:35,490
common form of public key certificate is

310
00:16:35,490 --> 00:16:42,029
the x.509 standard there are various

311
00:16:42,029 --> 00:16:45,589
signature formats one is called cedis

312
00:16:45,589 --> 00:16:49,589
it's based on XML documents see this

313
00:16:49,589 --> 00:16:53,790
with C naught X which are all common

314
00:16:53,790 --> 00:16:55,860
binary documents of any kind so that can

315
00:16:55,860 --> 00:16:59,339
also be pictures for example x-ray

316
00:16:59,339 --> 00:17:03,389
images and similar documents if we talk

317
00:17:03,389 --> 00:17:06,630
about eye health again Paytas is based

318
00:17:06,630 --> 00:17:09,449
on PDF documents and then there's a

319
00:17:09,449 --> 00:17:12,809
so-called ASIC which is an Associated

320
00:17:12,809 --> 00:17:17,849
signature container there are various

321
00:17:17,849 --> 00:17:21,990
ways of packing the signature not every

322
00:17:21,990 --> 00:17:25,380
format allows all of them we will

323
00:17:25,380 --> 00:17:27,929
briefly see that in the demo one is

324
00:17:27,929 --> 00:17:33,320
called enveloped where the information

325
00:17:33,320 --> 00:17:39,190
is usually readable as it would be

326
00:17:39,190 --> 00:17:42,790
the signature is enveloped inside that's

327
00:17:42,790 --> 00:17:47,260
document for example in XML it's in a

328
00:17:47,260 --> 00:17:50,470
special tag enveloping is the other way

329
00:17:50,470 --> 00:17:54,580
around where the signed information is

330
00:17:54,580 --> 00:17:58,030
usually not readable and the document is

331
00:17:58,030 --> 00:18:03,280
inside the signed information detach is

332
00:18:03,280 --> 00:18:05,410
having them separately and internally

333
00:18:05,410 --> 00:18:08,320
detach is also a specific variation of

334
00:18:08,320 --> 00:18:15,250
that here we have the signature creation

335
00:18:15,250 --> 00:18:20,380
and validation process in detail a hash

336
00:18:20,380 --> 00:18:24,400
code is calculated then with that hash

337
00:18:24,400 --> 00:18:34,900
code the document is signed and then on

338
00:18:34,900 --> 00:18:37,390
the verification side the hash code is

339
00:18:37,390 --> 00:18:41,380
calculated again used to decrypt the

340
00:18:41,380 --> 00:18:42,820
signature with the public key of the

341
00:18:42,820 --> 00:18:47,110
sender and verify whether the document

342
00:18:47,110 --> 00:18:49,660
has been manipulated or whether it's

343
00:18:49,660 --> 00:19:00,910
correct the alias digital signature

344
00:19:00,910 --> 00:19:07,510
format is an EU initiative although in

345
00:19:07,510 --> 00:19:12,280
some cases especially a PSD to and other

346
00:19:12,280 --> 00:19:14,320
transactions it can also be used

347
00:19:14,320 --> 00:19:19,470
elsewhere but it's been pushed by the EU

348
00:19:19,470 --> 00:19:22,750
so there are some example use cases of

349
00:19:22,750 --> 00:19:25,780
course hospitals nowadays are very

350
00:19:25,780 --> 00:19:28,360
popular that for example one Hospital

351
00:19:28,360 --> 00:19:31,570
shares some data either they do research

352
00:19:31,570 --> 00:19:36,660
trying to find a new co with 19 drug

353
00:19:36,660 --> 00:19:39,460
pharmacies also can exchange data and

354
00:19:39,460 --> 00:19:41,590
make sure that the prescriptions have

355
00:19:41,590 --> 00:19:45,670
not been falsified and of course

356
00:19:45,670 --> 00:19:48,250
companies can exchange data with public

357
00:19:48,250 --> 00:19:52,570
administrations or individual citizens

358
00:19:52,570 --> 00:19:55,870
also exchange data with public so civil

359
00:19:55,870 --> 00:20:01,779
servants and public administrations the

360
00:20:01,779 --> 00:20:04,720
TSS framework is also like the EDA's

361
00:20:04,720 --> 00:20:08,289
initiative sponsored and supported by

362
00:20:08,289 --> 00:20:14,139
the European Union it's an open source

363
00:20:14,139 --> 00:20:15,759
of the library everything can be found

364
00:20:15,759 --> 00:20:20,769
on github to support electronic

365
00:20:20,769 --> 00:20:23,769
signature creation and validation the

366
00:20:23,769 --> 00:20:25,809
TSS framework supports the creation and

367
00:20:25,809 --> 00:20:27,539
verification of interoperable

368
00:20:27,539 --> 00:20:29,379
interoperable and secure electronic

369
00:20:29,379 --> 00:20:33,549
signatures in line with legislation by

370
00:20:33,549 --> 00:20:36,580
the European Union the free major

371
00:20:36,580 --> 00:20:38,259
features are the creation of a digital

372
00:20:38,259 --> 00:20:40,779
signature extension of a digital

373
00:20:40,779 --> 00:20:43,330
signature and validation of a digital

374
00:20:43,330 --> 00:20:47,259
signature it supports all the major

375
00:20:47,259 --> 00:20:52,450
formats like XML PDF Word and other

376
00:20:52,450 --> 00:20:56,110
documents plaintext or archives using

377
00:20:56,110 --> 00:21:01,059
the Sada's format all the various

378
00:21:01,059 --> 00:21:03,129
packaging structures that were I

379
00:21:03,129 --> 00:21:06,730
mentioned already and the different

380
00:21:06,730 --> 00:21:08,309
signatures being either

381
00:21:08,309 --> 00:21:13,570
Sada's Sada's peters and the variations

382
00:21:13,570 --> 00:21:19,620
of basic containers that if are profiles

383
00:21:19,620 --> 00:21:22,120
associated to each form of the digital

384
00:21:22,120 --> 00:21:25,899
signature and trust management with a

385
00:21:25,899 --> 00:21:28,929
chain of trust that also spreads across

386
00:21:28,929 --> 00:21:32,950
different countries the verification

387
00:21:32,950 --> 00:21:37,720
data when a signature can be revoked at

388
00:21:37,720 --> 00:21:42,269
some point the certificate chain and

389
00:21:42,269 --> 00:21:43,870
validation based on a particular

390
00:21:43,870 --> 00:21:48,610
validation policy to validate both the

391
00:21:48,610 --> 00:21:52,559
signature and the signing certificate

392
00:21:52,830 --> 00:21:54,400
now let's look

393
00:21:54,400 --> 00:22:03,990
the live demo okay you see my browser

394
00:22:04,680 --> 00:22:10,810
yes okay so for the sake of time we

395
00:22:10,810 --> 00:22:14,380
skipped the creation of the signature so

396
00:22:14,380 --> 00:22:17,560
I've already prepared something and this

397
00:22:17,560 --> 00:22:19,930
as you see it's life so it's not running

398
00:22:19,930 --> 00:22:22,600
on my system everybody can access this

399
00:22:22,600 --> 00:22:26,830
on this particular URL it's the most

400
00:22:26,830 --> 00:22:30,160
recent version of the live demo web app

401
00:22:30,160 --> 00:22:33,270
of the TSS framework so it's running

402
00:22:33,270 --> 00:22:36,090
Java EE basically it runs on every

403
00:22:36,090 --> 00:22:41,530
Tomcat or compatible web container so

404
00:22:41,530 --> 00:22:43,510
here we have the part of signing the

405
00:22:43,510 --> 00:22:46,570
document which for the sake of time

406
00:22:46,570 --> 00:22:53,370
saving we'll skip there's also lots of

407
00:22:53,370 --> 00:22:55,510
documentation here you have a link to

408
00:22:55,510 --> 00:22:56,790
the github repository

409
00:22:56,790 --> 00:22:59,410
there's also standalone application

410
00:22:59,410 --> 00:23:02,340
which is based on Java FX again please

411
00:23:02,340 --> 00:23:04,780
feel free to try this yourself

412
00:23:04,780 --> 00:23:09,760
there are standalone bundles either one

413
00:23:09,760 --> 00:23:11,620
that already comes with everything

414
00:23:11,620 --> 00:23:14,260
including the right JDK and channel FX

415
00:23:14,260 --> 00:23:16,390
or if you have all of that on your

416
00:23:16,390 --> 00:23:17,710
machine already if you're a Java

417
00:23:17,710 --> 00:23:20,380
developer you usually should then you

418
00:23:20,380 --> 00:23:21,940
can use the minimal zip that only

419
00:23:21,940 --> 00:23:26,320
contains a fetch our and a patch file or

420
00:23:26,320 --> 00:23:28,660
you can also create a shell script to

421
00:23:28,660 --> 00:23:31,690
start it and that's how how you would

422
00:23:31,690 --> 00:23:35,050
sign it so again we've already done that

423
00:23:35,050 --> 00:23:38,500
for you so let's go over to the

424
00:23:38,500 --> 00:23:42,760
validation part but let's briefly have a

425
00:23:42,760 --> 00:23:44,980
look at what I mentioned about the

426
00:23:44,980 --> 00:23:47,620
trusted signatures so I'm going to show

427
00:23:47,620 --> 00:23:53,280
you two different examples one is an hl7

428
00:23:53,280 --> 00:23:59,380
FH IR XML that's a very recent new

429
00:23:59,380 --> 00:24:02,200
updated format of hl7 to exchange

430
00:24:02,200 --> 00:24:04,240
medical data and especially in the

431
00:24:04,240 --> 00:24:07,330
current corona situation that's used

432
00:24:07,330 --> 00:24:07,900
quite

433
00:24:07,900 --> 00:24:10,350
to exchange all sorts of data including

434
00:24:10,350 --> 00:24:12,790
how many people have died or how many

435
00:24:12,790 --> 00:24:16,080
people have recovered and other things

436
00:24:16,080 --> 00:24:20,020
but it it may also be used to exchange

437
00:24:20,020 --> 00:24:23,260
research data for example this is the

438
00:24:23,260 --> 00:24:28,420
list of trusted sites for the highest

439
00:24:28,420 --> 00:24:31,630
level you can see it almost every

440
00:24:31,630 --> 00:24:45,970
country in the EU has such a site okay

441
00:24:45,970 --> 00:24:51,690
and now let's let's look at the two

442
00:24:51,690 --> 00:24:55,150
mentioned signatures so the first one is

443
00:24:55,150 --> 00:24:57,100
is an observation

444
00:24:57,100 --> 00:25:02,170
it's an enveloped XML data so you can

445
00:25:02,170 --> 00:25:04,240
actually reach the data here in the

446
00:25:04,240 --> 00:25:11,200
preview as mentioned it's hl7 following

447
00:25:11,200 --> 00:25:20,350
the new hl7 F H AI R format and this is

448
00:25:20,350 --> 00:25:23,760
the part where the signature itself is

449
00:25:23,760 --> 00:25:27,160
digitally encoded and enveloped inside

450
00:25:27,160 --> 00:25:30,910
the XML in case of the enveloping a

451
00:25:30,910 --> 00:25:32,470
group with the aura around but then you

452
00:25:32,470 --> 00:25:35,080
would usually not be able to read it

453
00:25:35,080 --> 00:25:38,790
except with a special powder

454
00:25:43,760 --> 00:25:47,580
this one I have signed myself with the

455
00:25:47,580 --> 00:25:49,830
standalone app so don't be scared that

456
00:25:49,830 --> 00:25:52,230
there's a lot of yellow and red here

457
00:25:52,230 --> 00:25:54,210
that's for a reason

458
00:25:54,210 --> 00:25:57,660
what's important is that the format in

459
00:25:57,660 --> 00:25:59,670
the basic building block is perfectly

460
00:25:59,670 --> 00:26:02,430
valid everything is green down here so

461
00:26:02,430 --> 00:26:05,550
that's the important part this means

462
00:26:05,550 --> 00:26:07,440
there is no certificate chain so it's

463
00:26:07,440 --> 00:26:11,760
it's a damaged self certificate that you

464
00:26:11,760 --> 00:26:14,760
can use yourself when you run this app

465
00:26:14,760 --> 00:26:17,340
so it's not that's why it's not trusted

466
00:26:17,340 --> 00:26:20,810
and as it also means that all the other

467
00:26:20,810 --> 00:26:24,600
criteria up here are usually not met

468
00:26:24,600 --> 00:26:27,540
because there's no proper certificate

469
00:26:27,540 --> 00:26:35,070
chain so if we now look at at the other

470
00:26:35,070 --> 00:26:39,960
example which comes from the ESS test

471
00:26:39,960 --> 00:26:44,070
pad as you already see a qes here means

472
00:26:44,070 --> 00:26:45,930
it's a qualified electronic signature

473
00:26:45,930 --> 00:26:49,860
again in in Paris I think this is

474
00:26:49,860 --> 00:26:52,920
actually amber lopping and not enveloped

475
00:26:52,920 --> 00:26:57,750
but it's still a PDF that you can read

476
00:26:57,750 --> 00:27:01,290
and the signature is embedded using the

477
00:27:01,290 --> 00:27:05,910
pedis format inside the PDF in special

478
00:27:05,910 --> 00:27:10,140
hidden attributes so you will also see

479
00:27:10,140 --> 00:27:14,310
the signature in your a taupe or another

480
00:27:14,310 --> 00:27:20,730
PDF reader and here you see this has

481
00:27:20,730 --> 00:27:25,500
been created by somebody from the TSS

482
00:27:25,500 --> 00:27:28,190
framework or inside the U and it's a

483
00:27:28,190 --> 00:27:35,090
trusted 8a PS QAS certificate and

484
00:27:35,090 --> 00:27:39,330
therefore almost everything is green

485
00:27:39,330 --> 00:27:42,420
here and passes I believe that's just

486
00:27:42,420 --> 00:27:46,620
one particular item that's this one has

487
00:27:46,620 --> 00:27:48,690
no revocation data that's the only thing

488
00:27:48,690 --> 00:27:50,640
that this means that there's no

489
00:27:50,640 --> 00:27:52,530
revocation data it's a test certificate

490
00:27:52,530 --> 00:27:54,660
again so it wouldn't make sense to

491
00:27:54,660 --> 00:27:55,620
revoke it

492
00:27:55,620 --> 00:27:57,809
but in real life you may also set the

493
00:27:57,809 --> 00:28:00,570
revocation deadlines claim that this

494
00:28:00,570 --> 00:28:03,000
expires at a certain point for test

495
00:28:03,000 --> 00:28:05,340
purposes it makes little sense and

496
00:28:05,340 --> 00:28:09,020
everything else in this particular QAS

497
00:28:09,020 --> 00:28:21,900
example is green and has passed here are

498
00:28:21,900 --> 00:28:26,299
the links to the ESS framework and the

499
00:28:26,299 --> 00:28:31,289
relevant organizations and departments

500
00:28:31,289 --> 00:28:34,730
of the European Union

501
00:28:35,360 --> 00:28:41,220
the DSS framework on github you can find

502
00:28:41,220 --> 00:28:45,299
it I also have a little bit of improving

503
00:28:45,299 --> 00:28:47,850
it especially when it comes to Java 9

504
00:28:47,850 --> 00:28:51,799
cheeks or modularity so if you are

505
00:28:51,799 --> 00:28:55,230
specialized in this area or you have

506
00:28:55,230 --> 00:28:58,649
some general Java knowledge like

507
00:28:58,649 --> 00:29:02,039
upgrading it to Java 15 or 16 then feel

508
00:29:02,039 --> 00:29:06,539
free to fork it and provide pull

509
00:29:06,539 --> 00:29:09,919
requests the guys are usually quite

510
00:29:09,919 --> 00:29:14,720
thankful for improvements and again

511
00:29:14,720 --> 00:29:17,220
since this is something that's used at

512
00:29:17,220 --> 00:29:20,159
least across the EU and also American

513
00:29:20,159 --> 00:29:22,169
and other contributors to the DSS

514
00:29:22,169 --> 00:29:26,340
framework you will then have a chance to

515
00:29:26,340 --> 00:29:28,919
contribute back to something that's

516
00:29:28,919 --> 00:29:31,860
really used in in health care and eat

517
00:29:31,860 --> 00:29:33,899
government in real life and you may

518
00:29:33,899 --> 00:29:36,330
actually end up saving the lives of

519
00:29:36,330 --> 00:29:39,659
people or making lives better greater

520
00:29:39,659 --> 00:29:45,380
right here are some additional

521
00:29:45,380 --> 00:29:48,210
frameworks underneath the hood so a lot

522
00:29:48,210 --> 00:29:52,039
of Apache projects are used especially

523
00:29:52,039 --> 00:29:57,630
sanctuary o for XML Security's PDF box

524
00:29:57,630 --> 00:30:00,960
for pedis and the bouncy castle

525
00:30:00,960 --> 00:30:07,720
framework ok not sure I guess the

526
00:30:07,720 --> 00:30:11,710
a would work by a slack or mr. Q&A here

527
00:30:11,710 --> 00:30:15,639
oh I guess there is a cure nice but so

528
00:30:15,639 --> 00:30:17,500
far we are John thanks a lot for your

529
00:30:17,500 --> 00:30:18,370
attention

530
00:30:18,370 --> 00:30:20,230
feel free to follow both of us on

531
00:30:20,230 --> 00:30:22,509
Twitter and do have some time for

532
00:30:22,509 --> 00:30:28,509
questions Alicia I think you're a mute

533
00:30:28,509 --> 00:30:32,049
Alicia that's what happens when you have

534
00:30:32,049 --> 00:30:34,929
two mutes and you use both of them so

535
00:30:34,929 --> 00:30:36,549
the question I'll throw at you right

536
00:30:36,549 --> 00:30:39,610
away is obviously this talk is focused

537
00:30:39,610 --> 00:30:43,659
very much on health and the ego so I do

538
00:30:43,659 --> 00:30:45,429
these frameworks have applicability

539
00:30:45,429 --> 00:30:48,159
beyond that though we're perhaps moving

540
00:30:48,159 --> 00:30:50,860
into financial services or some other

541
00:30:50,860 --> 00:30:55,960
areas too I briefly mentioned the PDS

542
00:30:55,960 --> 00:30:59,580
two initiative by the European Union and

543
00:30:59,580 --> 00:31:03,820
they're the ADA's certificates also play

544
00:31:03,820 --> 00:31:06,460
a very important role so you can

545
00:31:06,460 --> 00:31:10,389
obviously create certificates using a

546
00:31:10,389 --> 00:31:13,299
DSS framework and then also use it in

547
00:31:13,299 --> 00:31:15,340
the financial sector so the underlying

548
00:31:15,340 --> 00:31:18,610
standards leaving the pages and say this

549
00:31:18,610 --> 00:31:22,360
part aside but everything else that's

550
00:31:22,360 --> 00:31:25,980
below especially the ADA compliant

551
00:31:25,980 --> 00:31:30,970
digital certificate is relevant far

552
00:31:30,970 --> 00:31:32,710
beyond that and especially in PSC - and

553
00:31:32,710 --> 00:31:35,649
oh and I guess both the doors and I have

554
00:31:35,649 --> 00:31:38,110
worked for multiple banks so we know

555
00:31:38,110 --> 00:31:41,259
that this is really used in real life by

556
00:31:41,259 --> 00:31:43,269
banks and financial service providers

557
00:31:43,269 --> 00:31:46,539
financial service providers as well or

558
00:31:46,539 --> 00:31:51,100
also in common is acquiring let me put

559
00:31:51,100 --> 00:31:54,610
it that way public sector projects like

560
00:31:54,610 --> 00:31:58,090
for example any customs related software

561
00:31:58,090 --> 00:31:59,980
and all this kind of stuff where you

562
00:31:59,980 --> 00:32:02,500
really have to comply to specific

563
00:32:02,500 --> 00:32:04,570
regulations there are specific rules

564
00:32:04,570 --> 00:32:07,899
when it comes to Goods and customs so

565
00:32:07,899 --> 00:32:10,360
yes we've seen that also in real life

566
00:32:10,360 --> 00:32:14,139
also in other areas other than health

567
00:32:14,139 --> 00:32:18,190
itself well very good well thank you

568
00:32:18,190 --> 00:32:21,230
gentlemen for everything and yeah if yes

569
00:32:21,230 --> 00:32:22,580
to hang out and slack and just see if

570
00:32:22,580 --> 00:32:23,990
there's any other questions that come up

571
00:32:23,990 --> 00:32:26,240
I know people have been in and out of

572
00:32:26,240 --> 00:32:29,720
there so yeah a lot of people are waking

573
