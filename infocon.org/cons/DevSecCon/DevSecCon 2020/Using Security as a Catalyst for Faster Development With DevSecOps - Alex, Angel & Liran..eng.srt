47
00:02:00,810 --> 00:02:04,170
here angel and leerin and for everyone

48
00:02:04,170 --> 00:02:06,210
out there it's so nice to have a

49
00:02:06,210 --> 00:02:09,119
discussion here I have been very

50
00:02:09,119 --> 00:02:11,550
interested in the whole topic around

51
00:02:11,550 --> 00:02:13,800
DevOps for a long time

52
00:02:13,800 --> 00:02:17,100
and one of the learnings that we have

53
00:02:17,100 --> 00:02:19,860
had and studying DevOps from a cloud

54
00:02:19,860 --> 00:02:21,870
native perspective is the iterative

55
00:02:21,870 --> 00:02:24,780
development and how that really helped

56
00:02:24,780 --> 00:02:27,210
really propel our native technologies

57
00:02:27,210 --> 00:02:29,190
and through the process of that

58
00:02:29,190 --> 00:02:31,200
continuous learning that continuous

59
00:02:31,200 --> 00:02:33,150
iteration there's been more and more

60
00:02:33,150 --> 00:02:35,520
finely granular ways to really improve

61
00:02:35,520 --> 00:02:37,440
processes people in technology and

62
00:02:37,440 --> 00:02:39,540
that's really why I want to focus on are

63
00:02:39,540 --> 00:02:41,100
the processes that people in technology

64
00:02:41,100 --> 00:02:44,730
and I love to look at it from a spectrum

65
00:02:44,730 --> 00:02:46,740
perspective and what I mean by that is

66
00:02:46,740 --> 00:02:49,410
thinking about the spectrum from from

67
00:02:49,410 --> 00:02:52,170
left to right and I'd love to talk with

68
00:02:52,170 --> 00:02:54,990
you a little bit about how security is a

69
00:02:54,990 --> 00:02:58,590
catalyst at different phases of that

70
00:02:58,590 --> 00:03:00,210
spectrum and starting way over on the

71
00:03:00,210 --> 00:03:04,710
left with the people who have been

72
00:03:04,710 --> 00:03:07,110
really on the cutting edge maybe they

73
00:03:07,110 --> 00:03:09,360
work for internet scale companies that

74
00:03:09,360 --> 00:03:10,950
they're working in you know in

75
00:03:10,950 --> 00:03:12,630
environments where DevOps has been

76
00:03:12,630 --> 00:03:13,950
something that they've maybe been done

77
00:03:13,950 --> 00:03:15,570
for a few years at least

78
00:03:15,570 --> 00:03:18,390
how is security catalyst for them and

79
00:03:18,390 --> 00:03:19,590
then I'd like to kind of move it to the

80
00:03:19,590 --> 00:03:21,600
right and in the process I'd like to

81
00:03:21,600 --> 00:03:23,220
hear you talk about the people the

82
00:03:23,220 --> 00:03:25,020
processes and the technology so there

83
00:03:25,020 --> 00:03:27,570
maybe we can get started with you sure

84
00:03:27,570 --> 00:03:29,340
so I think it's it's an interesting

85
00:03:29,340 --> 00:03:31,500
point on understanding at first to guess

86
00:03:31,500 --> 00:03:35,160
on what kind of teams are we looking at

87
00:03:35,160 --> 00:03:37,590
I think like what are we looking a

88
00:03:37,590 --> 00:03:39,180
looking at open source project you know

89
00:03:39,180 --> 00:03:42,750
very dev dev owning their projects or

90
00:03:42,750 --> 00:03:44,700
you know enterprises where you have no

91
00:03:44,700 --> 00:03:46,800
more structured organizations you know

92
00:03:46,800 --> 00:03:48,300
more structured teams you know owning

93
00:03:48,300 --> 00:03:50,370
some of some of these things so I think

94
00:03:50,370 --> 00:03:52,080
I can probably discuss a bit a bit about

95
00:03:52,080 --> 00:03:53,760
both but I'll start showing the

96
00:03:53,760 --> 00:03:55,140
enterprise I guess that's kind of like

97
00:03:55,140 --> 00:03:57,840
maybe what is appealing to the crowd

98
00:03:57,840 --> 00:03:59,670
here and I think what I've seen before

99
00:03:59,670 --> 00:04:03,000
is I've seen I've seen this being owned

100
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:07,350
by by DevOps security /dev stock ops

101
00:04:07,350 --> 00:04:08,880
walls which is what I've seen on

102
00:04:08,880 --> 00:04:11,010
customers as well for those you know

103
00:04:11,010 --> 00:04:12,660
using other product and what I'm

104
00:04:12,660 --> 00:04:14,880
thinking is they are the catalyst in

105
00:04:14,880 --> 00:04:16,529
terms of they want to make sure they are

106
00:04:16,529 --> 00:04:20,010
up in terms of compliance in terms of

107
00:04:20,010 --> 00:04:21,510
you know scanning the apps making sure

108
00:04:21,510 --> 00:04:24,000
no one you know does anything that is

109
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:25,380
kind of like you know out of bounds

110
00:04:25,380 --> 00:04:27,090
that's like an easy win

111
00:04:27,090 --> 00:04:28,530
I think that's that's been a lot of like

112
00:04:28,530 --> 00:04:30,060
the catalyst that's kind of like drives

113
00:04:30,060 --> 00:04:31,440
things like you know finding the

114
00:04:31,440 --> 00:04:33,740
solutions you know as they go off

115
00:04:33,740 --> 00:04:36,419
finding the solutions as they go as they

116
00:04:36,419 --> 00:04:38,820
go off and so angel when you look at

117
00:04:38,820 --> 00:04:40,740
these very advanced teams what do you

118
00:04:40,740 --> 00:04:43,590
see as what they're still trying to

119
00:04:43,590 --> 00:04:45,210
achieve what are they still looking for

120
00:04:45,210 --> 00:04:48,960
and what are they achieved already yeah

121
00:04:48,960 --> 00:04:52,410
I think I'm actually you know to kind of

122
00:04:52,410 --> 00:04:55,169
define I think a catalyst I'd I think

123
00:04:55,169 --> 00:04:57,060
I'd like to talk about where things

124
00:04:57,060 --> 00:04:59,700
started a couple years ago right like

125
00:04:59,700 --> 00:05:05,040
before you had this nice relationship

126
00:05:05,040 --> 00:05:07,800
between Devon ops and then where did the

127
00:05:07,800 --> 00:05:09,560
security sit in that in that

128
00:05:09,560 --> 00:05:12,150
relationship right I mean it was always

129
00:05:12,150 --> 00:05:14,220
and you know not to disparage anyone but

130
00:05:14,220 --> 00:05:16,800
the security weenies are like you know

131
00:05:16,800 --> 00:05:18,479
sometimes on a different level on a

132
00:05:18,479 --> 00:05:21,150
floor or something in the building and

133
00:05:21,150 --> 00:05:22,919
and those those barriers were already

134
00:05:22,919 --> 00:05:25,530
there and it's really impressive to see

135
00:05:25,530 --> 00:05:29,789
how those you know barriers that existed

136
00:05:29,789 --> 00:05:33,030
before are kind of being knocked down

137
00:05:33,030 --> 00:05:36,630
with with the onset of DevOps and and

138
00:05:36,630 --> 00:05:39,600
how that's all moving forward so I think

139
00:05:39,600 --> 00:05:41,789
the catalyst for me or at least you know

140
00:05:41,789 --> 00:05:43,650
defining a catalyst today and then these

141
00:05:43,650 --> 00:05:46,229
advanced folks how they're operating and

142
00:05:46,229 --> 00:05:47,789
implementing security and everything

143
00:05:47,789 --> 00:05:51,000
they do has to stem from how it used to

144
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:52,919
be back in the day right I remember when

145
00:05:52,919 --> 00:05:55,440
you know security always came from a

146
00:05:55,440 --> 00:05:58,590
place of no and it's again for me it's

147
00:05:58,590 --> 00:06:00,330
really amazing to see how it's you know

148
00:06:00,330 --> 00:06:03,510
flipped for the most part the security

149
00:06:03,510 --> 00:06:04,919
people are now coming from a place of

150
00:06:04,919 --> 00:06:07,380
yes because they have better

151
00:06:07,380 --> 00:06:09,570
relationships across the board right not

152
00:06:09,570 --> 00:06:11,400
only with developers with the operators

153
00:06:11,400 --> 00:06:14,580
with the stakeholders in the business

154
00:06:14,580 --> 00:06:18,020
right so I think once you have that nice

155
00:06:18,020 --> 00:06:22,110
culture you know percolating that lends

156
00:06:22,110 --> 00:06:25,050
itself to to then be able to operate and

157
00:06:25,050 --> 00:06:29,010
I'm almost like a seamless processes

158
00:06:29,010 --> 00:06:31,320
right so how did those more advanced

159
00:06:31,320 --> 00:06:34,500
teams then find their way to be on the

160
00:06:34,500 --> 00:06:37,080
same floor I I mean you know we hear a

161
00:06:37,080 --> 00:06:40,229
lot about the cultural value that comes

162
00:06:40,229 --> 00:06:40,850
when

163
00:06:40,850 --> 00:06:43,730
you have developer teams working

164
00:06:43,730 --> 00:06:46,670
together with operations teams now with

165
00:06:46,670 --> 00:06:49,820
security teams how have you seen this

166
00:06:49,820 --> 00:06:52,160
happen and what is still where's still

167
00:06:52,160 --> 00:06:53,720
these advanced teams trying to achieve

168
00:06:53,720 --> 00:06:55,430
what is it that they're looking for

169
00:06:55,430 --> 00:06:59,030
what's their quest yeah so developers

170
00:06:59,030 --> 00:07:01,820
you know it's a funny for me at least

171
00:07:01,820 --> 00:07:03,800
when I was a developer I didn't really

172
00:07:03,800 --> 00:07:05,750
think about security to be fair like you

173
00:07:05,750 --> 00:07:07,160
know back in the day I'm talking you

174
00:07:07,160 --> 00:07:10,610
know 25 years ago security was the last

175
00:07:10,610 --> 00:07:13,130
thing on my mind you know honestly and

176
00:07:13,130 --> 00:07:15,440
it took you know an external like I said

177
00:07:15,440 --> 00:07:18,380
office security office to kind of make

178
00:07:18,380 --> 00:07:20,390
sure that this stuff we were producing

179
00:07:20,390 --> 00:07:23,120
it was compliant but by that time it was

180
00:07:23,120 --> 00:07:25,550
already too late in my mind's right we

181
00:07:25,550 --> 00:07:27,110
were doing things they developing

182
00:07:27,110 --> 00:07:29,060
software for about a month two months

183
00:07:29,060 --> 00:07:31,700
and then oh by the way you need to make

184
00:07:31,700 --> 00:07:34,940
it operate in this in a lockdown fashion

185
00:07:34,940 --> 00:07:38,300
or whatever but so I think the there's a

186
00:07:38,300 --> 00:07:40,910
few elements that change that at least

187
00:07:40,910 --> 00:07:43,130
for me was the and one of the biggest

188
00:07:43,130 --> 00:07:45,800
ones was open source right so a lot when

189
00:07:45,800 --> 00:07:47,090
I was developing software a lot of the

190
00:07:47,090 --> 00:07:48,370
libraries who were using we're like

191
00:07:48,370 --> 00:07:50,840
proprietary you had to pay for it right

192
00:07:50,840 --> 00:07:54,500
so most of the time even if you had a

193
00:07:54,500 --> 00:07:56,390
security vulnerability you couldn't do

194
00:07:56,390 --> 00:07:58,100
anything with it because you had to have

195
00:07:58,100 --> 00:08:00,260
the parent company that sold you that

196
00:08:00,260 --> 00:08:02,720
software to fix it right when open

197
00:08:02,720 --> 00:08:04,550
source came around now right everybody

198
00:08:04,550 --> 00:08:08,780
had access to this code now you know you

199
00:08:08,780 --> 00:08:10,880
could actually patch whatever was broken

200
00:08:10,880 --> 00:08:12,950
and then you know submit that out to to

201
00:08:12,950 --> 00:08:15,500
upstream so that it could be implemented

202
00:08:15,500 --> 00:08:18,710
across the board but now open source has

203
00:08:18,710 --> 00:08:20,210
also opened up a couple of other

204
00:08:20,210 --> 00:08:23,300
Pandora's boxes with dependencies right

205
00:08:23,300 --> 00:08:26,060
so it's kind of same problem with the

206
00:08:26,060 --> 00:08:28,370
proprietary software but now you know

207
00:08:28,370 --> 00:08:29,990
you have to have deep knowledge of the

208
00:08:29,990 --> 00:08:32,299
project that you're using and even you

209
00:08:32,299 --> 00:08:33,700
know the different layers that are

210
00:08:33,700 --> 00:08:36,830
included in other projects right so you

211
00:08:36,830 --> 00:08:38,960
could have like a chain of you know 10

212
00:08:38,960 --> 00:08:42,080
different dependencies upstream that you

213
00:08:42,080 --> 00:08:44,450
know if you're if you're not really deep

214
00:08:44,450 --> 00:08:46,160
in the code you don't know where where

215
00:08:46,160 --> 00:08:47,750
those things are right and how to fix

216
00:08:47,750 --> 00:08:50,060
them so I think you know my my answer is

217
00:08:50,060 --> 00:08:53,450
the open source has changed how we used

218
00:08:53,450 --> 00:08:54,720
to operate and

219
00:08:54,720 --> 00:08:57,389
so you know enabled developers to be a

220
00:08:57,389 --> 00:08:59,250
lot more knowledgeable and have a little

221
00:08:59,250 --> 00:09:01,730
bit of an investment in making sure that

222
00:09:01,730 --> 00:09:04,050
this stuff they're producing is secure

223
00:09:04,050 --> 00:09:07,410
right from the start how would you list

224
00:09:07,410 --> 00:09:08,910
rate that leerin I'm curious in your

225
00:09:08,910 --> 00:09:11,100
perspective an open source because one

226
00:09:11,100 --> 00:09:12,810
of the issues we're running across now

227
00:09:12,810 --> 00:09:15,660
as open source security platforms become

228
00:09:15,660 --> 00:09:19,709
more more widely recognized there are

229
00:09:19,709 --> 00:09:21,959
some conflicts still with security

230
00:09:21,959 --> 00:09:24,959
professionals we're saying yeah we use

231
00:09:24,959 --> 00:09:27,120
your platform but we can't talk about

232
00:09:27,120 --> 00:09:29,610
that we're not going to discuss that you

233
00:09:29,610 --> 00:09:31,769
know or they might say you know why are

234
00:09:31,769 --> 00:09:33,930
you developing this out in the open are

235
00:09:33,930 --> 00:09:35,639
those challenges that these more

236
00:09:35,639 --> 00:09:37,110
advanced teams face when they're

237
00:09:37,110 --> 00:09:38,759
thinking when they're trying to embrace

238
00:09:38,759 --> 00:09:40,199
open source yet they're still seeing

239
00:09:40,199 --> 00:09:41,850
some of these tensions that come from

240
00:09:41,850 --> 00:09:44,250
historical the circle mini edge of the

241
00:09:44,250 --> 00:09:46,529
relationship between dev and developers

242
00:09:46,529 --> 00:09:50,610
option security well I have seen that in

243
00:09:50,610 --> 00:09:53,399
a way in terms of like I've seen like

244
00:09:53,399 --> 00:09:56,519
Tim's in largely you know big

245
00:09:56,519 --> 00:09:58,709
organizations where they would wither

246
00:09:58,709 --> 00:10:00,540
with like strict specific open source

247
00:10:00,540 --> 00:10:02,639
packages so they would like they would

248
00:10:02,639 --> 00:10:04,319
have a process where there's like an

249
00:10:04,319 --> 00:10:06,089
internal proxy inside organizations and

250
00:10:06,089 --> 00:10:07,470
they would they would have to kind of

251
00:10:07,470 --> 00:10:11,879
like you like define a very small or

252
00:10:11,879 --> 00:10:13,889
like a wide list of supported packages

253
00:10:13,889 --> 00:10:15,480
so like there is some kind of like

254
00:10:15,480 --> 00:10:17,490
tension in terms of you know from one

255
00:10:17,490 --> 00:10:19,019
hand especially I think in JavaScript

256
00:10:19,019 --> 00:10:20,339
with a plethora of you know wolf is

257
00:10:20,339 --> 00:10:22,290
first package is you can't just go off

258
00:10:22,290 --> 00:10:23,850
you know if you if you do like an NPM

259
00:10:23,850 --> 00:10:25,199
ISO on some like create direct project

260
00:10:25,199 --> 00:10:26,879
or something like that you get

261
00:10:26,879 --> 00:10:28,790
immediately like you know broke broken

262
00:10:28,790 --> 00:10:31,649
builds because like those packages are

263
00:10:31,649 --> 00:10:33,300
not widely Saturday they would have to

264
00:10:33,300 --> 00:10:34,589
go back to security team and say you

265
00:10:34,589 --> 00:10:36,389
know and it is this this and that you

266
00:10:36,389 --> 00:10:38,129
know and it will it will be a process in

267
00:10:38,129 --> 00:10:39,750
terms of the amount of time in tool it

268
00:10:39,750 --> 00:10:41,339
will take you know a security team to

269
00:10:41,339 --> 00:10:43,110
actually fed them to to lease them out

270
00:10:43,110 --> 00:10:45,089
to allow them so I mean that's one

271
00:10:45,089 --> 00:10:46,709
challenge I've actually seen it in you

272
00:10:46,709 --> 00:10:48,240
know in one company in a pretty large

273
00:10:48,240 --> 00:10:50,430
organization but they do it's not like

274
00:10:50,430 --> 00:10:51,569
you know you can use the bleeding edge

275
00:10:51,569 --> 00:10:53,209
of open source and do whatever he wants

276
00:10:53,209 --> 00:10:56,189
yeah I could see that I and will be more

277
00:10:56,189 --> 00:10:58,050
doubt to you know to the right a little

278
00:10:58,050 --> 00:11:00,029
bit I mean I wanted to look at this in

279
00:11:00,029 --> 00:11:01,259
three phases you don't have a ton of

280
00:11:01,259 --> 00:11:03,839
time but you know kind of like maybe

281
00:11:03,839 --> 00:11:05,819
it's the the middle of the spectrum here

282
00:11:05,819 --> 00:11:06,540
where

283
00:11:06,540 --> 00:11:08,880
companies are starting to adopt order

284
00:11:08,880 --> 00:11:10,890
there they've established a DevOps

285
00:11:10,890 --> 00:11:13,830
practice internally but they're still

286
00:11:13,830 --> 00:11:16,170
learning the different you know ways

287
00:11:16,170 --> 00:11:17,580
that their teams need to work together

288
00:11:17,580 --> 00:11:19,500
they're they're learning more about

289
00:11:19,500 --> 00:11:22,680
Microsoft by micro-services I as you

290
00:11:22,680 --> 00:11:25,080
know as the days and weeks go by they

291
00:11:25,080 --> 00:11:26,550
might be thinking about cloud native

292
00:11:26,550 --> 00:11:28,200
architectures you know such as

293
00:11:28,200 --> 00:11:31,560
kubernetes they're there they're in it

294
00:11:31,560 --> 00:11:34,950
but they're still trying to find that

295
00:11:34,950 --> 00:11:37,290
catalyst and how are they finding

296
00:11:37,290 --> 00:11:39,750
security how a security catalyst for

297
00:11:39,750 --> 00:11:41,250
this group because these are the you

298
00:11:41,250 --> 00:11:42,900
seem to be like you know that the middle

299
00:11:42,900 --> 00:11:47,910
market right here yes I think one of

300
00:11:47,910 --> 00:11:50,520
these things is like a catalyst is a

301
00:11:50,520 --> 00:11:53,040
thing first of all when you have those

302
00:11:53,040 --> 00:11:54,750
tools that are like you know you can

303
00:11:54,750 --> 00:11:56,700
just embed them in the CI city and like

304
00:11:56,700 --> 00:11:58,470
dev psych ops is you know I don't know

305
00:11:58,470 --> 00:12:00,120
if today like that's the new buzzword or

306
00:12:00,120 --> 00:12:01,770
the old buzzword but that's definitely a

307
00:12:01,770 --> 00:12:03,120
buzzword and people are trying to

308
00:12:03,120 --> 00:12:05,520
integrate that and do more of it

309
00:12:05,520 --> 00:12:07,110
and like push you know whatever is

310
00:12:07,110 --> 00:12:09,150
security into the into the ops so I

311
00:12:09,150 --> 00:12:10,440
think we're seeing that more and more

312
00:12:10,440 --> 00:12:12,150
and with the fact that you know

313
00:12:12,150 --> 00:12:13,650
everything is kind of like centered

314
00:12:13,650 --> 00:12:15,390
centered around like you know repository

315
00:12:15,390 --> 00:12:17,280
kind of like workflows you'll you'll

316
00:12:17,280 --> 00:12:19,110
also see more of those so I think that's

317
00:12:19,110 --> 00:12:20,640
definitely a catalyst and like you I

318
00:12:20,640 --> 00:12:22,110
think you'll end up saying you know and

319
00:12:22,110 --> 00:12:25,320
like any any any person on the spectrum

320
00:12:25,320 --> 00:12:27,120
adding those kind of integrations

321
00:12:27,120 --> 00:12:28,890
whether they are devs or DevOps you know

322
00:12:28,890 --> 00:12:30,660
trying to just add more you know of

323
00:12:30,660 --> 00:12:33,270
those CI checks and stuff like that so

324
00:12:33,270 --> 00:12:35,550
so angel we've seen you know we've been

325
00:12:35,550 --> 00:12:39,000
discussing how security plays a role in

326
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:41,490
these more advanced subset Ops teams and

327
00:12:41,490 --> 00:12:44,100
and I would expect that they just find

328
00:12:44,100 --> 00:12:48,920
it more efficient as they may be able to

329
00:12:48,920 --> 00:12:52,800
just get through the security process a

330
00:12:52,800 --> 00:12:55,140
little bit faster perhaps now these

331
00:12:55,140 --> 00:12:56,760
people who are in this middle section

332
00:12:56,760 --> 00:12:58,290
where the u n-- you see the door opening

333
00:12:58,290 --> 00:13:00,030
they can see the light to some extent

334
00:13:00,030 --> 00:13:03,540
right what is the catalyst for them well

335
00:13:03,540 --> 00:13:09,000
and why is it security right so just

336
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:12,270
going back to and actually go back a

337
00:13:12,270 --> 00:13:14,820
little left right so now the waste offer

338
00:13:14,820 --> 00:13:17,100
is being developed and the tooling so

339
00:13:17,100 --> 00:13:20,610
like you know github right they're using

340
00:13:20,610 --> 00:13:23,549
they bought a company to actually

341
00:13:23,549 --> 00:13:26,009
implement security and and basically you

342
00:13:26,009 --> 00:13:28,429
know in their platform right so so

343
00:13:28,429 --> 00:13:31,589
security is actually being implemented

344
00:13:31,589 --> 00:13:35,339
with weight left right and even in going

345
00:13:35,339 --> 00:13:38,999
more and more left and and to get to the

346
00:13:38,999 --> 00:13:40,559
middle so so it's already kind of pre

347
00:13:40,559 --> 00:13:43,319
baked right when we're talking about of

348
00:13:43,319 --> 00:13:46,139
the middle section so it's becoming more

349
00:13:46,139 --> 00:13:49,410
and more prevalent in the in the

350
00:13:49,410 --> 00:13:50,850
beginning stages of like Stephen

351
00:13:50,850 --> 00:13:53,879
designing software now there's so many

352
00:13:53,879 --> 00:13:56,939
tools out there but they weren't that

353
00:13:56,939 --> 00:13:58,920
great and now that the tools are getting

354
00:13:58,920 --> 00:13:59,910
better and they're getting more

355
00:13:59,910 --> 00:14:02,100
integrated right and there's a lot more

356
00:14:02,100 --> 00:14:05,369
databases out there now so you know when

357
00:14:05,369 --> 00:14:07,290
I was coming up in the government you

358
00:14:07,290 --> 00:14:09,059
know we were using NIST was a big one

359
00:14:09,059 --> 00:14:10,889
with with their database and then mitre

360
00:14:10,889 --> 00:14:12,989
I combined together now you have

361
00:14:12,989 --> 00:14:15,299
companies like sneak who actually have I

362
00:14:15,299 --> 00:14:16,920
believe you you you're all doing your

363
00:14:16,920 --> 00:14:18,959
own right on top of all of that stuff

364
00:14:18,959 --> 00:14:21,299
you're doing some some assessments right

365
00:14:21,299 --> 00:14:24,720
and in providing information so the

366
00:14:24,720 --> 00:14:28,319
middle of this you know catalysts are

367
00:14:28,319 --> 00:14:29,879
the cows for the for the middle of the

368
00:14:29,879 --> 00:14:32,579
people in the middle it's already kind

369
00:14:32,579 --> 00:14:34,470
of pre baked for them right so they're

370
00:14:34,470 --> 00:14:36,059
there are just accepting what's already

371
00:14:36,059 --> 00:14:38,189
there and what I like to call their

372
00:14:38,189 --> 00:14:40,470
grepping it through the process right so

373
00:14:40,470 --> 00:14:43,230
if you've already started on the far

374
00:14:43,230 --> 00:14:45,749
left and you've got a really solid you

375
00:14:45,749 --> 00:14:48,449
know security kind of process you just

376
00:14:48,449 --> 00:14:50,459
grep it on through into ops right and

377
00:14:50,459 --> 00:14:52,290
then Ops is already sitting there and

378
00:14:52,290 --> 00:14:53,970
they're just validating making sure

379
00:14:53,970 --> 00:14:55,769
things in compliance maybe in that stage

380
00:14:55,769 --> 00:14:58,169
and then when you did to do the deploys

381
00:14:58,169 --> 00:15:01,169
again you know you have probably some QA

382
00:15:01,169 --> 00:15:02,730
folks and then maybe your your actual

383
00:15:02,730 --> 00:15:05,429
security people are vetting to make sure

384
00:15:05,429 --> 00:15:08,040
that hey this stuff is in compliance and

385
00:15:08,040 --> 00:15:11,419
it's you know it within acceptable

386
00:15:11,419 --> 00:15:15,179
realms of you know status for their

387
00:15:15,179 --> 00:15:17,100
their security checks if that makes

388
00:15:17,100 --> 00:15:17,369
sense

389
00:15:17,369 --> 00:15:20,790
mmm-hmm I'd like to maybe throw it throw

390
00:15:20,790 --> 00:15:23,639
the the left part here and I think if

391
00:15:23,639 --> 00:15:25,319
you look at it and like maybe throw it

392
00:15:25,319 --> 00:15:26,610
back to the left I think we can talk

393
00:15:26,610 --> 00:15:28,230
about maybe a couple of things so one of

394
00:15:28,230 --> 00:15:31,049
them is I think we'd open-source

395
00:15:31,049 --> 00:15:32,879
specifically again what we're saying

396
00:15:32,879 --> 00:15:33,720
I've at least

397
00:15:33,720 --> 00:15:35,459
the npm ecosystem which i think is

398
00:15:35,459 --> 00:15:36,839
amazing for us is you know by default

399
00:15:36,839 --> 00:15:38,879
when you install something you know npm

400
00:15:38,879 --> 00:15:40,529
will give you you know a specific report

401
00:15:40,529 --> 00:15:42,389
of vulnerabilities and i think this is

402
00:15:42,389 --> 00:15:44,339
this is like a really good example of

403
00:15:44,339 --> 00:15:46,050
like educating the community in terms of

404
00:15:46,050 --> 00:15:47,850
you know it hasn't been there before but

405
00:15:47,850 --> 00:15:49,259
now when you install something you know

406
00:15:49,259 --> 00:15:50,850
when you do it just you know as your

407
00:15:50,850 --> 00:15:52,740
regular you know not related security

408
00:15:52,740 --> 00:15:53,970
like you just said before until right

409
00:15:53,970 --> 00:15:54,930
you we're not thinking about security

410
00:15:54,930 --> 00:15:56,850
but now when you add a package when you

411
00:15:56,850 --> 00:15:58,920
add something as a dependency you'll get

412
00:15:58,920 --> 00:16:01,050
a report and i think like that's already

413
00:16:01,050 --> 00:16:03,089
an amazing step in terms of you know we

414
00:16:03,089 --> 00:16:04,829
are now creating awareness that happens

415
00:16:04,829 --> 00:16:06,509
by default so people now understand that

416
00:16:06,509 --> 00:16:08,009
you know there's some vulnerabilities

417
00:16:08,009 --> 00:16:09,569
maybe i need to take some actions so

418
00:16:09,569 --> 00:16:11,100
these tribes you know this for me is a

419
00:16:11,100 --> 00:16:13,019
catalyst I'm seeing you know devs you

420
00:16:13,019 --> 00:16:14,250
know now saying well I have you know

421
00:16:14,250 --> 00:16:16,230
15,000 vulnerabilities what do I do

422
00:16:16,230 --> 00:16:17,879
about it now so now they are creating

423
00:16:17,879 --> 00:16:19,620
the conversation in terms of going to

424
00:16:19,620 --> 00:16:21,540
DevOps going to security now asking you

425
00:16:21,540 --> 00:16:23,850
know watered right proper like

426
00:16:23,850 --> 00:16:25,529
processors what should we do about it

427
00:16:25,529 --> 00:16:28,560
etc on the other hand it adds this

428
00:16:28,560 --> 00:16:31,439
challenge were now fingers I know I've

429
00:16:31,439 --> 00:16:33,180
definitely seen a cynic that personally

430
00:16:33,180 --> 00:16:35,370
as well experience this with a community

431
00:16:35,370 --> 00:16:37,680
and that is this challenge or maybe we

432
00:16:37,680 --> 00:16:39,269
are creating a lot of noise as well so

433
00:16:39,269 --> 00:16:41,550
you know we didn't want to have this you

434
00:16:41,550 --> 00:16:43,199
know how you have with like end to end

435
00:16:43,199 --> 00:16:45,209
you know regular testing builds were if

436
00:16:45,209 --> 00:16:47,910
it just fails all the time at one point

437
00:16:47,910 --> 00:16:49,649
developers will start to ignore it right

438
00:16:49,649 --> 00:16:51,420
they'll they'll just deploy to

439
00:16:51,420 --> 00:16:53,309
production whatever if all the time they

440
00:16:53,309 --> 00:16:56,009
get is like failures and if every time

441
00:16:56,009 --> 00:16:57,509
they install a package or they do

442
00:16:57,509 --> 00:16:58,949
something they just get more and more

443
00:16:58,949 --> 00:17:01,470
vulnerabilities at some point they will

444
00:17:01,470 --> 00:17:02,850
you know get go ahead and ignore it and

445
00:17:02,850 --> 00:17:06,119
that's no bad for us so I think it's a

446
00:17:06,119 --> 00:17:07,530
good driver a good catalyst but at the

447
00:17:07,530 --> 00:17:09,900
same time we are seeing this challenge

448
00:17:09,900 --> 00:17:11,369
where you know we might be adding a lot

449
00:17:11,369 --> 00:17:13,199
of noise and this is I think where

450
00:17:13,199 --> 00:17:15,390
there's now an opportunity as well to

451
00:17:15,390 --> 00:17:17,490
figure out you know can we give them you

452
00:17:17,490 --> 00:17:19,949
know more specifically fine-grained

453
00:17:19,949 --> 00:17:21,390
information like where is this

454
00:17:21,390 --> 00:17:23,459
vulnerability coming from is it actually

455
00:17:23,459 --> 00:17:25,530
exploitable is there a way to prioritize

456
00:17:25,530 --> 00:17:28,470
these vulnerabilities a lot of things

457
00:17:28,470 --> 00:17:29,970
that I think you know there's like a lot

458
00:17:29,970 --> 00:17:32,039
of room that we can improve on that part

459
00:17:32,039 --> 00:17:33,780
from the left and then [ __ ] you know and

460
00:17:33,780 --> 00:17:35,520
then create that catalyst as like a

461
00:17:35,520 --> 00:17:37,890
really good you know discussion maker in

462
00:17:37,890 --> 00:17:40,440
your organization so it sounds like from

463
00:17:40,440 --> 00:17:44,490
the both of you that it's it's not

464
00:17:44,490 --> 00:17:46,350
necessarily fact that things are not

465
00:17:46,350 --> 00:17:47,460
baked in we're seeing thing

466
00:17:47,460 --> 00:17:51,149
that are more baked and so we're seeing

467
00:17:51,149 --> 00:17:53,399
more ways to discover vulnerabilities

468
00:17:53,399 --> 00:17:56,399
for example and there's more ways to

469
00:17:56,399 --> 00:17:59,309
remediate the ball abilities but the

470
00:17:59,309 --> 00:18:02,549
challenge is in prioritization for

471
00:18:02,549 --> 00:18:06,659
example and data and adaptation to some

472
00:18:06,659 --> 00:18:09,750
other I would expect to well like I said

473
00:18:09,750 --> 00:18:11,940
when I was coming up Mary we I didn't

474
00:18:11,940 --> 00:18:13,559
even if I had a security tool that was

475
00:18:13,559 --> 00:18:16,169
telling me hey you have a broken you

476
00:18:16,169 --> 00:18:18,270
know or a vulnerable piece of software

477
00:18:18,270 --> 00:18:19,980
that you're you know is within your

478
00:18:19,980 --> 00:18:24,200
stack and it gave me mitigation you know

479
00:18:24,200 --> 00:18:27,360
information or a way to you know to fix

480
00:18:27,360 --> 00:18:29,340
it yeah hell yeah I'm gonna fix that

481
00:18:29,340 --> 00:18:32,120
right and and you gotta remember as well

482
00:18:32,120 --> 00:18:34,890
back then we didn't really have the kind

483
00:18:34,890 --> 00:18:37,919
of interactions that company have today

484
00:18:37,919 --> 00:18:41,610
right like so b2b right when you're when

485
00:18:41,610 --> 00:18:42,990
you're a small start-up and you're

486
00:18:42,990 --> 00:18:44,730
working with I tell this to source all

487
00:18:44,730 --> 00:18:46,950
the time you know document everything

488
00:18:46,950 --> 00:18:49,289
you can document while you're doing it

489
00:18:49,289 --> 00:18:51,029
and getting that mode of starting to

490
00:18:51,029 --> 00:18:52,679
produce documents because when you start

491
00:18:52,679 --> 00:18:54,720
working with a big company you know a

492
00:18:54,720 --> 00:18:56,429
big customer they're gonna want those

493
00:18:56,429 --> 00:18:58,049
documents they want to know your dr

494
00:18:58,049 --> 00:18:59,490
plans your security plans they want to

495
00:18:59,490 --> 00:19:01,770
know all these things that that and how

496
00:19:01,770 --> 00:19:05,370
you handle you know incidents and with

497
00:19:05,370 --> 00:19:06,600
with the interactions that are happening

498
00:19:06,600 --> 00:19:09,029
you know in business i think that those

499
00:19:09,029 --> 00:19:10,740
are also drivers and catalyst as well

500
00:19:10,740 --> 00:19:13,559
for the change right this mindset of hey

501
00:19:13,559 --> 00:19:15,179
i'm even though you're a developer you

502
00:19:15,179 --> 00:19:17,190
still should have this and like I said

503
00:19:17,190 --> 00:19:19,409
the tools now today are way more

504
00:19:19,409 --> 00:19:21,500
advanced right so they'll give you

505
00:19:21,500 --> 00:19:24,990
exactly what you need to see in order

506
00:19:24,990 --> 00:19:26,760
for you to go ahead and you know patch

507
00:19:26,760 --> 00:19:30,179
along so that when the when in your

508
00:19:30,179 --> 00:19:31,649
process is your software development

509
00:19:31,649 --> 00:19:33,779
process move into the middle tier that

510
00:19:33,779 --> 00:19:35,429
we're talking about right now which is

511
00:19:35,429 --> 00:19:37,860
usually I'm assuming operations right

512
00:19:37,860 --> 00:19:40,110
those folks are just gonna validate that

513
00:19:40,110 --> 00:19:42,419
ok those builds maybe you know you have

514
00:19:42,419 --> 00:19:45,480
a security type of step in your builds

515
00:19:45,480 --> 00:19:47,010
in the beginning as a developer right

516
00:19:47,010 --> 00:19:49,770
with doing CI one of the things I always

517
00:19:49,770 --> 00:19:52,230
tell people to use a sneak right just go

518
00:19:52,230 --> 00:19:53,490
ahead and pump it in there because it's

519
00:19:53,490 --> 00:19:56,490
really compatible with circle CI and you

520
00:19:56,490 --> 00:19:58,289
know the first step in your build should

521
00:19:58,289 --> 00:19:59,910
be a securities game

522
00:19:59,910 --> 00:20:04,590
and and fail it right so in in if it

523
00:20:04,590 --> 00:20:06,600
fails you need to do an assessment and

524
00:20:06,600 --> 00:20:07,800
then say all right well these are

525
00:20:07,800 --> 00:20:09,150
acceptable and then you can tweak the

526
00:20:09,150 --> 00:20:12,000
the pipeline to you know continue moving

527
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:13,500
forward or not

528
00:20:13,500 --> 00:20:15,570
into that middle middle section for the

529
00:20:15,570 --> 00:20:16,980
for the more advanced folks who are

530
00:20:16,980 --> 00:20:18,600
going to about to deploy that software

531
00:20:18,600 --> 00:20:20,880
and that's how I'm at least viewing the

532
00:20:20,880 --> 00:20:25,770
question Alex so then I don't know it's

533
00:20:25,770 --> 00:20:27,990
great and one of the questions I have a

534
00:20:27,990 --> 00:20:29,940
follow-up on that is what are the tools

535
00:20:29,940 --> 00:20:31,980
that you're seeing that are really

536
00:20:31,980 --> 00:20:33,660
needed that we're not seeing yet like

537
00:20:33,660 --> 00:20:37,230
what what categories of advancements in

538
00:20:37,230 --> 00:20:40,890
terms of tools development are people

539
00:20:40,890 --> 00:20:44,820
really needing now it I think it all

540
00:20:44,820 --> 00:20:50,820
depends on the the the a few things that

541
00:20:50,820 --> 00:20:52,620
some of the elements are like what type

542
00:20:52,620 --> 00:20:53,730
of business are you in are you in a

543
00:20:53,730 --> 00:20:56,280
regulated space are you in you know an

544
00:20:56,280 --> 00:20:58,740
internet space you know depending on on

545
00:20:58,740 --> 00:21:02,100
what kind of business you're in will

546
00:21:02,100 --> 00:21:03,690
dictate you know if you're in the health

547
00:21:03,690 --> 00:21:06,330
healthcare industry you have probably

548
00:21:06,330 --> 00:21:08,220
you know it's regulated so you'd have

549
00:21:08,220 --> 00:21:12,450
more stringent security policies versus

550
00:21:12,450 --> 00:21:14,640
maybe you know a start-up that's doing

551
00:21:14,640 --> 00:21:17,460
API as a service or something they may

552
00:21:17,460 --> 00:21:19,290
be a little bit less they're more laxed

553
00:21:19,290 --> 00:21:19,620
right

554
00:21:19,620 --> 00:21:21,660
so I there's there's a couple elements

555
00:21:21,660 --> 00:21:23,520
like what what kind of industry or your

556
00:21:23,520 --> 00:21:25,530
you're producing software and the data

557
00:21:25,530 --> 00:21:29,850
that you're producing and and also yeah

558
00:21:29,850 --> 00:21:31,740
and then the tools you would have to

559
00:21:31,740 --> 00:21:33,390
obviously write you find a tool that

560
00:21:33,390 --> 00:21:36,600
would give you the capabilities that you

561
00:21:36,600 --> 00:21:39,210
need to identify vulnerabilities and all

562
00:21:39,210 --> 00:21:41,940
the other types of bone information so

563
00:21:41,940 --> 00:21:43,620
like you could run sneak and you can

564
00:21:43,620 --> 00:21:46,350
also run maybe chef's inspect right

565
00:21:46,350 --> 00:21:48,780
which is a nice combination yeah or for

566
00:21:48,780 --> 00:21:51,060
compliance right so you know and audits

567
00:21:51,060 --> 00:21:53,730
and things like that so yeah you know it

568
00:21:53,730 --> 00:21:57,810
depends everyone's you know different in

569
00:21:57,810 --> 00:21:59,240
that aspect

570
00:21:59,240 --> 00:22:02,340
so go ahead learn and then I'll have a

571
00:22:02,340 --> 00:22:03,990
last question no the question would go

572
00:22:03,990 --> 00:22:06,060
ahead yeah and I was gonna I was gonna

573
00:22:06,060 --> 00:22:08,310
just I guess talk more about

574
00:22:08,310 --> 00:22:09,720
prioritization because I think that's

575
00:22:09,720 --> 00:22:11,640
that's that's one key I was like a

576
00:22:11,640 --> 00:22:13,720
really good and fast enabler as well

577
00:22:13,720 --> 00:22:15,550
like Tim's you know get bombarded with a

578
00:22:15,550 --> 00:22:17,020
lot of information these days especially

579
00:22:17,020 --> 00:22:18,730
around open source dependencies I think

580
00:22:18,730 --> 00:22:20,950
why they need help with its prioritize

581
00:22:20,950 --> 00:22:23,170
like you know they get 100 you know more

582
00:22:23,170 --> 00:22:24,700
vulnerabilities using open source

583
00:22:24,700 --> 00:22:26,950
project now which one they should start

584
00:22:26,950 --> 00:22:29,680
first what is you know generally you

585
00:22:29,680 --> 00:22:31,150
know just a library just being you know

586
00:22:31,150 --> 00:22:33,670
used in the in the tree of you know open

587
00:22:33,670 --> 00:22:35,110
source packages

588
00:22:35,110 --> 00:22:37,330
you know just installed but not actually

589
00:22:37,330 --> 00:22:39,160
use right what if is that vulnerable

590
00:22:39,160 --> 00:22:40,930
metal is being you know invoked or is it

591
00:22:40,930 --> 00:22:43,120
not so to be able to like prioritize it

592
00:22:43,120 --> 00:22:45,130
right I think that is an area where

593
00:22:45,130 --> 00:22:46,750
we're going to see a lot of improvement

594
00:22:46,750 --> 00:22:48,490
coming up I think in in the in the

595
00:22:48,490 --> 00:22:51,280
following years for sure fascinating

596
00:22:51,280 --> 00:22:53,170
okay so we're going to move a little bit

597
00:22:53,170 --> 00:22:54,700
further over to the right and this is a

598
00:22:54,700 --> 00:22:56,860
group that I expect we're seeing a lot

599
00:22:56,860 --> 00:22:59,740
of these days unfortunately we're in a

600
00:22:59,740 --> 00:23:01,120
situation around the world where

601
00:23:01,120 --> 00:23:02,860
everyone has to stay home and it's

602
00:23:02,860 --> 00:23:04,270
changing business everywhere it's

603
00:23:04,270 --> 00:23:05,710
changing our lives is changing

604
00:23:05,710 --> 00:23:08,200
everything and we see it here in the

605
00:23:08,200 --> 00:23:09,910
United States in particular for instance

606
00:23:09,910 --> 00:23:12,010
with how the federal government is

607
00:23:12,010 --> 00:23:15,100
keeping it up with unemployment with or

608
00:23:15,100 --> 00:23:16,150
with others with their unemployment

609
00:23:16,150 --> 00:23:18,670
systems right there they're quite

610
00:23:18,670 --> 00:23:21,490
outdated and it's and it's very true I

611
00:23:21,490 --> 00:23:24,220
think as well for for large

612
00:23:24,220 --> 00:23:26,680
organizations and in the mean time we're

613
00:23:26,680 --> 00:23:28,480
facing almost like this wrinkle in time

614
00:23:28,480 --> 00:23:30,430
is the way we think of it let's you know

615
00:23:30,430 --> 00:23:32,350
it's almost like it's it's almost like

616
00:23:32,350 --> 00:23:34,150
I'm it's kind of hyperspeed overnight

617
00:23:34,150 --> 00:23:36,670
yeah you know in many industries and so

618
00:23:36,670 --> 00:23:38,440
now the question is how do they close

619
00:23:38,440 --> 00:23:41,050
that gap but all at the main time

620
00:23:41,050 --> 00:23:43,630
thinking of security and making sure

621
00:23:43,630 --> 00:23:45,760
that you know that they don't get burned

622
00:23:45,760 --> 00:23:47,920
right they don't get in a lot of trouble

623
00:23:47,920 --> 00:23:50,080
from a legal perspective from all kinds

624
00:23:50,080 --> 00:23:51,460
of respects as you can possibly think of

625
00:23:51,460 --> 00:23:54,640
so how is security catalyst for the

626
00:23:54,640 --> 00:23:56,200
people in these groups and where they're

627
00:23:56,200 --> 00:23:58,780
really having to act fast but we have to

628
00:23:58,780 --> 00:24:00,670
do it in a manner or they have to still

629
00:24:00,670 --> 00:24:02,290
think about those staple systems because

630
00:24:02,290 --> 00:24:03,640
they're probably most of them have that

631
00:24:03,640 --> 00:24:05,710
and but they just can't create it

632
00:24:05,710 --> 00:24:07,600
overnight so I'm really I'm really

633
00:24:07,600 --> 00:24:09,640
fascinated hear from your perspective on

634
00:24:09,640 --> 00:24:11,830
this particular group and how cats here

635
00:24:11,830 --> 00:24:13,630
he can be a callous for them as they

636
00:24:13,630 --> 00:24:16,540
move further to the left it sounds

637
00:24:16,540 --> 00:24:18,100
almost like you're asking for resources

638
00:24:18,100 --> 00:24:20,030
on cobble security right now

639
00:24:20,030 --> 00:24:23,179
[Laughter]

640
00:24:23,179 --> 00:24:25,820
yeah that's I guess that's really the

641
00:24:25,820 --> 00:24:27,399
tricky part weight security right like

642
00:24:27,399 --> 00:24:30,200
people will not see it as a viable

643
00:24:30,200 --> 00:24:32,330
option to invest because you know

644
00:24:32,330 --> 00:24:35,330
amazing security is not always visible

645
00:24:35,330 --> 00:24:37,669
and so on you know until that time where

646
00:24:37,669 --> 00:24:39,169
you get you know breached or issues you

647
00:24:39,169 --> 00:24:41,269
know you don't see it as something

648
00:24:41,269 --> 00:24:42,619
important I guess that's treat your part

649
00:24:42,619 --> 00:24:45,409
to its security but I think you know if

650
00:24:45,409 --> 00:24:47,179
I had if I had to imagine some of the

651
00:24:47,179 --> 00:24:48,639
things that you know they we do I think

652
00:24:48,639 --> 00:24:53,119
for some of these organizations what I

653
00:24:53,119 --> 00:24:56,210
what I would do is is go on like like a

654
00:24:56,210 --> 00:24:58,039
bug bounty system like a security bug

655
00:24:58,039 --> 00:25:00,440
bounty and you know just open a program

656
00:25:00,440 --> 00:25:03,229
because you know well I mean you like

657
00:25:03,229 --> 00:25:06,200
you created a system for like who know

658
00:25:06,200 --> 00:25:08,599
how long here's you're not gonna like

659
00:25:08,599 --> 00:25:10,609
there's not gonna be any magic wand now

660
00:25:10,609 --> 00:25:13,249
to wave off and say you know let's make

661
00:25:13,249 --> 00:25:15,019
sure that you know now everything is you

662
00:25:15,019 --> 00:25:16,580
know crystal clear amazing security

663
00:25:16,580 --> 00:25:18,499
baked in that's not gonna happen

664
00:25:18,499 --> 00:25:20,779
but you can do some like proactive

665
00:25:20,779 --> 00:25:23,989
things on your end which is you know be

666
00:25:23,989 --> 00:25:25,489
you know have a security team around

667
00:25:25,489 --> 00:25:26,839
like you know if you haven't done hunt

668
00:25:26,839 --> 00:25:28,909
that before you know it seems like you

669
00:25:28,909 --> 00:25:30,169
know that's organization did not have

670
00:25:30,169 --> 00:25:31,969
security you know as the top of its fine

671
00:25:31,969 --> 00:25:33,469
have a security contact have a security

672
00:25:33,469 --> 00:25:35,869
team have someone being you know able to

673
00:25:35,869 --> 00:25:37,519
like get those security reports from

674
00:25:37,519 --> 00:25:40,249
individuals and process them go off you

675
00:25:40,249 --> 00:25:41,839
know create also like a bug bounty

676
00:25:41,839 --> 00:25:43,549
program for security to make sure that

677
00:25:43,549 --> 00:25:44,749
you know hackers you know white hat

678
00:25:44,749 --> 00:25:47,089
hackers can go find issues report them

679
00:25:47,089 --> 00:25:49,009
safely and securely and you'll have time

680
00:25:49,009 --> 00:25:51,139
to remediate it as well so I think both

681
00:25:51,139 --> 00:25:54,710
of these tools are like good low-hanging

682
00:25:54,710 --> 00:25:56,149
fruit for like those kind of

683
00:25:56,149 --> 00:25:57,889
organizations to at least you know hit

684
00:25:57,889 --> 00:26:03,679
the ground running in a sense and to add

685
00:26:03,679 --> 00:26:06,979
to that and my thoughts on it are

686
00:26:06,979 --> 00:26:12,379
basically continuous surveillance right

687
00:26:12,379 --> 00:26:15,999
like right now you know having systems

688
00:26:15,999 --> 00:26:18,229
security systems that are actually

689
00:26:18,229 --> 00:26:21,139
watching surveilling detecting changes

690
00:26:21,139 --> 00:26:28,609
right and also having a a good

691
00:26:28,609 --> 00:26:30,889
understanding of how you're going to

692
00:26:30,889 --> 00:26:32,629
manage your incidents because at the end

693
00:26:32,629 --> 00:26:34,820
of the day we're all gonna get exposed

694
00:26:34,820 --> 00:26:36,890
as very compromised

695
00:26:36,890 --> 00:26:40,160
and I learned over time working in the

696
00:26:40,160 --> 00:26:43,010
federal government that it's not how you

697
00:26:43,010 --> 00:26:45,110
protect the system it's how you react to

698
00:26:45,110 --> 00:26:47,930
it right so tons of auditing make sure

699
00:26:47,930 --> 00:26:49,760
that you have the ability to log

700
00:26:49,760 --> 00:26:52,310
everything that's happened and then also

701
00:26:52,310 --> 00:26:53,750
have the ability to sift through that

702
00:26:53,750 --> 00:26:56,450
that data and figure out the important

703
00:26:56,450 --> 00:26:59,840
bits right one of the ways I I see it

704
00:26:59,840 --> 00:27:02,860
happening already I mean sneaked again

705
00:27:02,860 --> 00:27:05,360
it's just happening because it's I've

706
00:27:05,360 --> 00:27:07,550
noticed they have services right so like

707
00:27:07,550 --> 00:27:09,770
when I run again

708
00:27:09,770 --> 00:27:11,750
you know I hate to go left again on you

709
00:27:11,750 --> 00:27:14,240
but when you're running as a developer

710
00:27:14,240 --> 00:27:16,370
and you implement a tool like sneak on

711
00:27:16,370 --> 00:27:18,770
the back end right there they're storing

712
00:27:18,770 --> 00:27:20,330
that data and they have a monitoring

713
00:27:20,330 --> 00:27:23,230
service so I get an email every day

714
00:27:23,230 --> 00:27:26,150
telling me hey you still have a package

715
00:27:26,150 --> 00:27:28,100
that has been identified as vulnerable

716
00:27:28,100 --> 00:27:31,100
in this stack and they're reading right

717
00:27:31,100 --> 00:27:34,550
maybe the package.json file whatever if

718
00:27:34,550 --> 00:27:36,140
you're using a node app and they're

719
00:27:36,140 --> 00:27:38,540
alerting you right so so that's a great

720
00:27:38,540 --> 00:27:42,230
I would say you know catalyst for those

721
00:27:42,230 --> 00:27:44,000
folks that we're talking about on the

722
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:45,770
far right implementing those kind of

723
00:27:45,770 --> 00:27:48,080
services and tools that are constantly

724
00:27:48,080 --> 00:27:50,690
monitoring and giving you status right

725
00:27:50,690 --> 00:27:54,290
so if if you have that on it you may get

726
00:27:54,290 --> 00:27:56,360
that alert fatigue that lead on was

727
00:27:56,360 --> 00:27:58,610
talking about earlier but I'm the same

728
00:27:58,610 --> 00:28:01,430
token a security as professional won't

729
00:28:01,430 --> 00:28:03,200
be right I'm gonna be looking at that

730
00:28:03,200 --> 00:28:05,780
and they're gonna be bugging the

731
00:28:05,780 --> 00:28:07,430
developers the Ops teams whoever's

732
00:28:07,430 --> 00:28:10,070
involved for like hey why is this

733
00:28:10,070 --> 00:28:12,200
happening and this can't go on any

734
00:28:12,200 --> 00:28:15,350
longer right we're open here so you know

735
00:28:15,350 --> 00:28:18,440
again for me I think for the folks on

736
00:28:18,440 --> 00:28:20,030
the far right they they should

737
00:28:20,030 --> 00:28:22,790
definitely look into tooling to keep at

738
00:28:22,790 --> 00:28:24,860
constant surveillance of what's going on

739
00:28:24,860 --> 00:28:27,080
in their systems and I'm talking you

740
00:28:27,080 --> 00:28:28,880
know from scratch those source code all

741
00:28:28,880 --> 00:28:31,360
the way through that process and then

742
00:28:31,360 --> 00:28:35,480
also focus on you know mitigation

743
00:28:35,480 --> 00:28:38,210
strategies and and Incident Response and

744
00:28:38,210 --> 00:28:40,250
and and and those kind of tactics right

745
00:28:40,250 --> 00:28:42,860
strategies because that's how you're

746
00:28:42,860 --> 00:28:46,970
actually going to defeat the hacker they

747
00:28:46,970 --> 00:28:48,620
may get you for a little bit but if you

748
00:28:48,620 --> 00:28:50,750
have you know good surveillance you'll

749
00:28:50,750 --> 00:28:51,049
be able

750
00:28:51,049 --> 00:28:53,450
to detect what's going on figure it out

751
00:28:53,450 --> 00:28:55,519
and then shut them down and then go back

752
00:28:55,519 --> 00:28:57,320
and do your post mortems in a really

753
00:28:57,320 --> 00:28:59,960
really detailed away writes it to figure

754
00:28:59,960 --> 00:29:01,639
out how that happened and then try to

755
00:29:01,639 --> 00:29:04,220
prevent that then the question I have is

756
00:29:04,220 --> 00:29:07,549
in how can you make that hey ray how can

757
00:29:07,549 --> 00:29:11,360
you make that a way to be a catalyst for

758
00:29:11,360 --> 00:29:14,659
for DevOps then learn how how do these

759
00:29:14,659 --> 00:29:19,369
practices you know help enable DevOps so

760
00:29:19,369 --> 00:29:21,200
I think anything that you know would be

761
00:29:21,200 --> 00:29:23,239
able to get automated would it would end

762
00:29:23,239 --> 00:29:25,190
up ting that Bing dot and so that's why

763
00:29:25,190 --> 00:29:26,929
we're seeing you know all of those tools

764
00:29:26,929 --> 00:29:30,499
you know being embedded in you know fire

765
00:29:30,499 --> 00:29:32,929
off a circle you know build and you know

766
00:29:32,929 --> 00:29:37,009
security is is baked in great hey ray

767
00:29:37,009 --> 00:29:39,399
hey guys well we had some fantastic

768
00:29:39,399 --> 00:29:41,779
commentary in the slack and on Twitter

769
00:29:41,779 --> 00:29:44,330
we heard from the COBOL enthusiasm

770
00:29:44,330 --> 00:29:47,720
community first of us who is hearty all

771
00:29:47,720 --> 00:29:49,789
the way baby wants to remind you that

772
00:29:49,789 --> 00:29:51,769
there are co-heirs COBOL active

773
00:29:51,769 --> 00:29:53,779
development there's even capture the

774
00:29:53,779 --> 00:29:56,840
flags going on involving COBOL so it's

775
00:29:56,840 --> 00:29:59,029
not just unemployment systems in order

776
00:29:59,029 --> 00:30:02,480
to determine that we also heard from

777
00:30:02,480 --> 00:30:05,179
that angel we your fans certainly

778
00:30:05,179 --> 00:30:06,919
appreciate the optimism that we can

779
00:30:06,919 --> 00:30:08,480
actually defeat the hackers that's a

780
00:30:08,480 --> 00:30:10,639
that's a fantastic message to hear it

781
00:30:10,639 --> 00:30:13,789
admit that Eastern that we can win that

782
00:30:13,789 --> 00:30:18,350
we yeah we got this but mostly we well

783
00:30:18,350 --> 00:30:19,309
we heard from a lot of folks that

784
00:30:19,309 --> 00:30:20,869
basically really appreciated the

785
00:30:20,869 --> 00:30:23,269
interaction and the discussion and we

786
00:30:23,269 --> 00:30:24,619
would really like to thank you guys for

787
00:30:24,619 --> 00:30:25,999
staying up with us and for keeping

788
00:30:25,999 --> 00:30:28,279
everyone else so intrigued by a

789
00:30:28,279 --> 00:30:30,470
fantastic panel discussion so thank you

790
00:30:30,470 --> 00:30:37,309
all here let's do it again and for those

791
00:30:37,309 --> 00:30:38,720
of you they're still watching that on

792
00:30:38,720 --> 00:30:41,710
the talks online we are
