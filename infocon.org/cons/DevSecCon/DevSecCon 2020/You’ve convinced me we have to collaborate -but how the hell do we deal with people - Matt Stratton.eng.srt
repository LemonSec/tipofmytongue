uh you've convinced me we have

7
00:00:15,200 --> 00:00:18,640

9
00:00:20,320 --> 00:00:21,680

that's what everybody wants to know

12
00:00:24,400 --> 00:00:25,920
right like at the end of the day it's

13
00:00:25,920 --> 00:00:26,800
it's people

14
00:00:26,800 --> 00:00:29,920
and we talk a lot about theory but but

15
00:00:29,920 --> 00:00:31,599
but how do we actually do these things

16
00:00:31,599 --> 00:00:32,800
that we keep talking about so

17
00:00:32,800 --> 00:00:34,239

18
00:00:34,239 --> 00:00:37,680

27
00:00:59,280 --> 00:01:02,559
about you've convinced me we have to

28
00:01:02,559 --> 00:01:04,239
collaborate

29
00:01:04,239 --> 00:01:08,159
but how the hell do we deal with

30
00:01:08,159 --> 00:01:11,360
people so just a little bit uh

31
00:01:11,360 --> 00:01:13,200
about myself not too much i don't feel

32
00:01:13,200 --> 00:01:15,040
like i do a big resume slide also i know

33
00:01:15,040 --> 00:01:17,200
corey quinn is coming up in a couple and

34
00:01:17,200 --> 00:01:18,640
if he's watching this he would make fun

35
00:01:18,640 --> 00:01:20,640
of me for for doing this but that being

36
00:01:20,640 --> 00:01:21,200
said

37
00:01:21,200 --> 00:01:23,119
like i said my name is may stratton i'm

38
00:01:23,119 --> 00:01:25,280
primarily known in the devops industry

39
00:01:25,280 --> 00:01:25,759
for

40
00:01:25,759 --> 00:01:29,600
liking diet coke i guess uh but

41
00:01:29,600 --> 00:01:31,840
more relevant i am a transformation

42
00:01:31,840 --> 00:01:33,439
specialist at red hat

43
00:01:33,439 --> 00:01:35,840
is where i'm working currently i'm

44
00:01:35,840 --> 00:01:38,000
helping organizations with

45
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:40,880
their digital and devops transformation

46
00:01:40,880 --> 00:01:42,240
and all that fun stuff

47
00:01:42,240 --> 00:01:43,840
but probably the most important

48
00:01:43,840 --> 00:01:45,920
credential i have is this one from ryan

49
00:01:45,920 --> 00:01:47,600
kitchens at netflix

50
00:01:47,600 --> 00:01:49,360
who has gone on record to say that i

51
00:01:49,360 --> 00:01:51,119
have the best hair out of everybody and

52
00:01:51,119 --> 00:01:52,840
developer advocacy

53
00:01:52,840 --> 00:01:56,000
so what more could you could you ask for

54
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:59,600
in terms of legitimacy i i will say it's

55
00:01:59,600 --> 00:02:01,119
been it's very interesting to move into

56
00:02:01,119 --> 00:02:01,520
this

57
00:02:01,520 --> 00:02:04,799
uh virtual conference the

58
00:02:04,799 --> 00:02:06,320
i've been given a lot of conference

59
00:02:06,320 --> 00:02:08,479
talks over the years and

60
00:02:08,479 --> 00:02:10,560
my style we'll see how well it

61
00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:13,200
translates to the online experience

62
00:02:13,200 --> 00:02:16,080
so i appreciate you all being uh kind of

63
00:02:16,080 --> 00:02:16,400
uh

64
00:02:16,400 --> 00:02:18,480
use cases and test cases for this and

65
00:02:18,480 --> 00:02:20,319
lisa just talked to us all about testing

66
00:02:20,319 --> 00:02:20,800
so

67
00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:22,400
hey we're testing we're doing it live

68
00:02:22,400 --> 00:02:24,000
it's probably fine

69
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:26,560
fantastic all right so here's the thing

70
00:02:26,560 --> 00:02:27,760
right

71
00:02:27,760 --> 00:02:29,599
when you're talking about devops we've

72
00:02:29,599 --> 00:02:31,200
been talking about this devops thing

73
00:02:31,200 --> 00:02:35,120
for a very long time some might even say

74
00:02:35,120 --> 00:02:38,720
10 years or maybe more and

75
00:02:38,720 --> 00:02:41,360
at its core we're always been talking

76
00:02:41,360 --> 00:02:43,280
about collaboration it's in the name

77
00:02:43,280 --> 00:02:44,080
it's dev

78
00:02:44,080 --> 00:02:47,120
and ops and security and database and

79
00:02:47,120 --> 00:02:48,400
all the other stuff

80
00:02:48,400 --> 00:02:51,440
so we know collaboration is a thing we

81
00:02:51,440 --> 00:02:52,080
hear about it

82
00:02:52,080 --> 00:02:54,400
all the time right like how many talks

83
00:02:54,400 --> 00:02:55,440
have you been to

84
00:02:55,440 --> 00:02:58,239
that talk about why it's so important

85
00:02:58,239 --> 00:03:00,000
that we have to work together

86
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:02,640
we have to bring down the walls we hear

87
00:03:02,640 --> 00:03:03,120
this

88
00:03:03,120 --> 00:03:06,239
all the time and then we also hear a lot

89
00:03:06,239 --> 00:03:07,120
about

90
00:03:07,120 --> 00:03:10,239
empathy right this is

91
00:03:10,239 --> 00:03:13,519
this is such a key idea and

92
00:03:13,519 --> 00:03:15,920
it's true right like it makes sense we

93
00:03:15,920 --> 00:03:16,720
understand

94
00:03:16,720 --> 00:03:18,319
why it matters and that's the thing i'm

95
00:03:18,319 --> 00:03:19,920
not here to talk to you i'm not here to

96
00:03:19,920 --> 00:03:21,599
sell you on why it matters

97
00:03:21,599 --> 00:03:23,280
hopefully you've seen this before

98
00:03:23,280 --> 00:03:25,360
hopefully if not there's 10 years worth

99
00:03:25,360 --> 00:03:26,799
of devops days talks

100
00:03:26,799 --> 00:03:28,799
that will tell you all about it all

101
00:03:28,799 --> 00:03:31,200
about why empathy matters

102
00:03:31,200 --> 00:03:34,480
but at a certain point that feels like

103
00:03:34,480 --> 00:03:35,120
just

104
00:03:35,120 --> 00:03:38,239
so much blah blah blah you're like i got

105
00:03:38,239 --> 00:03:38,720
it

106
00:03:38,720 --> 00:03:42,879
i get it i'm on board this super matters

107
00:03:42,879 --> 00:03:45,200
this is the thing i want we we know it's

108
00:03:45,200 --> 00:03:46,959
important

109
00:03:46,959 --> 00:03:49,360
that's great enough with the theory

110
00:03:49,360 --> 00:03:52,480
because the reality is

111
00:03:52,560 --> 00:03:55,200
people muddy everything up right i don't

112
00:03:55,200 --> 00:03:55,599
know

113
00:03:55,599 --> 00:03:58,000
how many of you are working on teams of

114
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:00,000
one in a company of one

115
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:01,599
where you don't have to collaborate you

116
00:04:01,599 --> 00:04:03,439
don't have to work with people

117
00:04:03,439 --> 00:04:05,680
and the thing that you have no control

118
00:04:05,680 --> 00:04:07,360
over is everybody

119
00:04:07,360 --> 00:04:09,760
else that's that's where it gets really

120
00:04:09,760 --> 00:04:10,640
really hard

121
00:04:10,640 --> 00:04:12,239
and when it becomes time to say like

122
00:04:12,239 --> 00:04:15,040
okay cool i want to collaborate

123
00:04:15,040 --> 00:04:16,720
okay but now but people are fighting

124
00:04:16,720 --> 00:04:18,160
with me and people are

125
00:04:18,160 --> 00:04:21,279
blaming and people are arguing and

126
00:04:21,279 --> 00:04:23,280
i feel like i'm always bumping my head

127
00:04:23,280 --> 00:04:24,560
against the wall when i'm trying to

128
00:04:24,560 --> 00:04:25,680
reach out to these people

129
00:04:25,680 --> 00:04:27,199
and you maddy you've told me to have

130
00:04:27,199 --> 00:04:28,560
empathy you've told me to see where

131
00:04:28,560 --> 00:04:29,520
they're coming from

132
00:04:29,520 --> 00:04:32,240
and i'm trying man i am trying so hard

133
00:04:32,240 --> 00:04:32,800
but

134
00:04:32,800 --> 00:04:35,919
damn it these humans they keep messing

135
00:04:35,919 --> 00:04:37,360
it up

136
00:04:37,360 --> 00:04:38,400
so i'm going to take a little bit of

137
00:04:38,400 --> 00:04:40,479
time today to talk about some

138
00:04:40,479 --> 00:04:43,840
active things that we can do when we

139
00:04:43,840 --> 00:04:45,360
have to deal with this

140
00:04:45,360 --> 00:04:47,280
right when we have to deal with people

141
00:04:47,280 --> 00:04:48,560
because you know what

142
00:04:48,560 --> 00:04:51,520
you just do in all kinds of ways maybe

143
00:04:51,520 --> 00:04:53,600
there are people directly on your team

144
00:04:53,600 --> 00:04:55,360
maybe they're in an ancillary team that

145
00:04:55,360 --> 00:04:57,120
you interact with maybe they're your

146
00:04:57,120 --> 00:04:58,080
customers

147
00:04:58,080 --> 00:04:59,680
whether they're internal or external

148
00:04:59,680 --> 00:05:01,120
maybe they're people in an open source

149
00:05:01,120 --> 00:05:03,039
community that you're collaborating with

150
00:05:03,039 --> 00:05:04,400
that you're building something with

151
00:05:04,400 --> 00:05:06,160
together you know

152
00:05:06,160 --> 00:05:07,520
maybe it's your family we're not going

153
00:05:07,520 --> 00:05:08,800
to that as much but all these things

154
00:05:08,800 --> 00:05:09,520
apply

155
00:05:09,520 --> 00:05:12,320
when dealing with other humans who

156
00:05:12,320 --> 00:05:13,440
strangely enough

157
00:05:13,440 --> 00:05:16,400
do not know exactly what we mean all the

158
00:05:16,400 --> 00:05:18,240
time

159
00:05:18,240 --> 00:05:21,600
now just to hammer the point home

160
00:05:21,600 --> 00:05:24,639
this is backed up with science right so

161
00:05:24,639 --> 00:05:25,440
we look at

162
00:05:25,440 --> 00:05:27,120
the accelerate state of devops report in

163
00:05:27,120 --> 00:05:28,800
2019 and

164
00:05:28,800 --> 00:05:29,840
one of the things that was really

165
00:05:29,840 --> 00:05:32,000
interesting is in this report they took

166
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:33,600
things from project aristotle which was

167
00:05:33,600 --> 00:05:35,440
a re which was research that google did

168
00:05:35,440 --> 00:05:36,240
around

169
00:05:36,240 --> 00:05:38,960
psychological safety in teams at google

170
00:05:38,960 --> 00:05:39,520
and

171
00:05:39,520 --> 00:05:41,520
kind of wondered if this applied outside

172
00:05:41,520 --> 00:05:42,639
of google as well

173
00:05:42,639 --> 00:05:44,639
and spoiler alert or it's not a spoiler

174
00:05:44,639 --> 00:05:46,560
if you've been reading this slide

175
00:05:46,560 --> 00:05:48,960
it absolutely does not just apply within

176
00:05:48,960 --> 00:05:51,199
there this was consistent across all of

177
00:05:51,199 --> 00:05:52,400
the research right

178
00:05:52,400 --> 00:05:54,720
so a culture of psychological safety is

179
00:05:54,720 --> 00:05:55,840
predictive

180
00:05:55,840 --> 00:05:57,840
of software delivery performance

181
00:05:57,840 --> 00:05:59,360
organizational performance and

182
00:05:59,360 --> 00:06:00,400
productivity

183
00:06:00,400 --> 00:06:02,639
so in terms of your organization and

184
00:06:02,639 --> 00:06:04,880
your team actually functioning well and

185
00:06:04,880 --> 00:06:06,319
being able to deliver

186
00:06:06,319 --> 00:06:09,280
value this matters it also matters

187
00:06:09,280 --> 00:06:10,800
because you kind of don't want your life

188
00:06:10,800 --> 00:06:11,680
to suck

189
00:06:11,680 --> 00:06:14,000
but that's sometimes a little harder to

190
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:15,840
to prove the point so thank you

191
00:06:15,840 --> 00:06:17,840
state of devops report for putting some

192
00:06:17,840 --> 00:06:19,360
some numbers around this so we can talk

193
00:06:19,360 --> 00:06:20,000
business with

194
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:24,000
people cool cool cool cool

195
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:27,919
this is important we get it fine how

196
00:06:27,919 --> 00:06:30,319
how do we do this and specifically we're

197
00:06:30,319 --> 00:06:31,680
going to talk about a couple different

198
00:06:31,680 --> 00:06:32,639
things we're going to talk

199
00:06:32,639 --> 00:06:35,759
about this idea of psychological safety

200
00:06:35,759 --> 00:06:39,520
and what we can do to encourage

201
00:06:39,520 --> 00:06:42,400
psychological safety in teams if you've

202
00:06:42,400 --> 00:06:44,319
been watching this track

203
00:06:44,319 --> 00:06:47,280
this came up in various conference talks

204
00:06:47,280 --> 00:06:49,280
earlier about why psychological safety

205
00:06:49,280 --> 00:06:49,919
mattered

206
00:06:49,919 --> 00:06:52,000
sue talked about it uh we're going to

207
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:53,280
talk a little bit about

208
00:06:53,280 --> 00:06:54,800
and when we think about being in a

209
00:06:54,800 --> 00:06:56,639
learning organization that's that's also

210
00:06:56,639 --> 00:06:58,400
come up in previous talks

211
00:06:58,400 --> 00:07:00,000
having that psychological safety is

212
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:03,199
really key we've talked a lot

213
00:07:03,199 --> 00:07:06,319
about the need uh to be blamed

214
00:07:06,319 --> 00:07:07,520
we think we talk a lot about

215
00:07:07,520 --> 00:07:10,160
blamelessness right okay cool

216
00:07:10,160 --> 00:07:13,520
that's super hard but what can we do

217
00:07:13,520 --> 00:07:15,039
we've we also maybe have talked a lot

218
00:07:15,039 --> 00:07:17,280
about what we can do as individuals

219
00:07:17,280 --> 00:07:20,080
to help ourselves blame be more blame

220
00:07:20,080 --> 00:07:20,560
aware

221
00:07:20,560 --> 00:07:23,680
and blame free but that's just us

222
00:07:23,680 --> 00:07:25,440
what can we do to help the other people

223
00:07:25,440 --> 00:07:26,560
what can we do so we're going to talk a

224
00:07:26,560 --> 00:07:27,599
little bit about

225
00:07:27,599 --> 00:07:30,240
some facilitation tips when you're in a

226
00:07:30,240 --> 00:07:32,319
meeting and you're trying to keep

227
00:07:32,319 --> 00:07:34,960
things from getting blamey uh some

228
00:07:34,960 --> 00:07:35,599
things you can

229
00:07:35,599 --> 00:07:37,599
can do if you're facilitating a meeting

230
00:07:37,599 --> 00:07:39,440
like that

231
00:07:39,440 --> 00:07:42,840
and we're gonna talk uh also

232
00:07:42,840 --> 00:07:45,440
about conflict and how you can

233
00:07:45,440 --> 00:07:46,479
de-escalate

234
00:07:46,479 --> 00:07:50,400
conflict because that really conflict

235
00:07:50,400 --> 00:07:52,160
conflict is a thing that happens because

236
00:07:52,160 --> 00:07:53,759
strangely enough not everybody agrees

237
00:07:53,759 --> 00:07:54,960
with you all the time

238
00:07:54,960 --> 00:07:56,160
sometimes just because they don't have

239
00:07:56,160 --> 00:07:58,000
the same information that you do

240
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:00,400
so when conflict escalates it can be an

241
00:08:00,400 --> 00:08:01,360
impediment

242
00:08:01,360 --> 00:08:03,039
to accomplishing everything or

243
00:08:03,039 --> 00:08:05,199
accomplishing anything for that matter

244
00:08:05,199 --> 00:08:07,280
so what are some things we can do

245
00:08:07,280 --> 00:08:09,039
whether it's to de-escalate

246
00:08:09,039 --> 00:08:11,440
or to be able to have more productive

247
00:08:11,440 --> 00:08:12,240
work

248
00:08:12,240 --> 00:08:15,520
when we are in conflict and hopefully

249
00:08:15,520 --> 00:08:17,039
these are things that might be helpful

250
00:08:17,039 --> 00:08:19,039
in personal conflict as well but that's

251
00:08:19,039 --> 00:08:22,000
maybe a different conference track

252
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:25,840
so back to this idea of psychological

253
00:08:25,840 --> 00:08:26,639
safety

254
00:08:26,639 --> 00:08:28,639
you hear about this a lot maybe maybe

255
00:08:28,639 --> 00:08:30,319
you don't necessarily know what it means

256
00:08:30,319 --> 00:08:33,200
so let's find out right so amy edmondson

257
00:08:33,200 --> 00:08:34,880
from harvard business school

258
00:08:34,880 --> 00:08:36,640
this is basically what psychological

259
00:08:36,640 --> 00:08:38,479
safety is

260
00:08:38,479 --> 00:08:41,440
it's a sense of confidence that your

261
00:08:41,440 --> 00:08:42,640
team will not

262
00:08:42,640 --> 00:08:45,920
embarrass reject or

263
00:08:45,920 --> 00:08:49,040
punish someone for speaking up

264
00:08:49,040 --> 00:08:51,519
that's psychological safety right that i

265
00:08:51,519 --> 00:08:53,440
understand

266
00:08:53,440 --> 00:08:54,959
i have not even though i understand i

267
00:08:54,959 --> 00:08:57,600
have confidence that if i speak up

268
00:08:57,600 --> 00:08:59,680
if i bring something up within my group

269
00:08:59,680 --> 00:09:01,760
and within my team

270
00:09:01,760 --> 00:09:04,080
they're not going to make me feel dumb

271
00:09:04,080 --> 00:09:05,440
they're not going to make me embarrassed

272
00:09:05,440 --> 00:09:06,320
they're not going to tell

273
00:09:06,320 --> 00:09:08,320
they're not going to reject me and make

274
00:09:08,320 --> 00:09:09,680
me feel excluded

275
00:09:09,680 --> 00:09:11,040
and also that i'm not going to be

276
00:09:11,040 --> 00:09:12,880
punished and this

277
00:09:12,880 --> 00:09:15,839
is so important for so many reasons

278
00:09:15,839 --> 00:09:16,720
right

279
00:09:16,720 --> 00:09:18,480
because the thing is when people i've

280
00:09:18,480 --> 00:09:19,839
said this before

281
00:09:19,839 --> 00:09:21,519
you know if people are afraid of being

282
00:09:21,519 --> 00:09:23,279
punished for making mistakes that is not

283
00:09:23,279 --> 00:09:24,800
going to make them

284
00:09:24,800 --> 00:09:27,519
make fewer mistakes it makes them become

285
00:09:27,519 --> 00:09:29,200
subject matter experts in hiding their

286
00:09:29,200 --> 00:09:30,240
mistakes

287
00:09:30,240 --> 00:09:32,880
and if people are in a in a situation

288
00:09:32,880 --> 00:09:34,160
where they feel like they have to hide

289
00:09:34,160 --> 00:09:36,320
their mistakes it's because there is

290
00:09:36,320 --> 00:09:38,959
no or a low low low level of

291
00:09:38,959 --> 00:09:40,399
psychological safety

292
00:09:40,399 --> 00:09:42,160
and when people feel that they need to

293
00:09:42,160 --> 00:09:43,760
hide their mistakes you are well and

294
00:09:43,760 --> 00:09:45,040
truly screwed

295
00:09:45,040 --> 00:09:47,120
because you have no idea what is going

296
00:09:47,120 --> 00:09:48,839
on in your environment

297
00:09:48,839 --> 00:09:51,519
anymore so here's a couple things that

298
00:09:51,519 --> 00:09:53,040
you can do

299
00:09:53,040 --> 00:09:54,800
that we can do i shouldn't just say you

300
00:09:54,800 --> 00:09:56,480
we can all do these things

301
00:09:56,480 --> 00:09:59,760
to help foster more psychological safety

302
00:09:59,760 --> 00:10:02,640
within a team so the first one is

303
00:10:02,640 --> 00:10:03,200
approach

304
00:10:03,200 --> 00:10:06,000
conflict as a collaborator not as an

305
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:07,200
adversary

306
00:10:07,200 --> 00:10:10,320
the point when we when within a group if

307
00:10:10,320 --> 00:10:11,040
we are having

308
00:10:11,040 --> 00:10:13,680
a difference of some kind it's not about

309
00:10:13,680 --> 00:10:15,200
me trying to win

310
00:10:15,200 --> 00:10:17,600
and prove myself right and that's really

311
00:10:17,600 --> 00:10:19,279
hard especially for me

312
00:10:19,279 --> 00:10:21,600
i like to be right we kind of all like

313
00:10:21,600 --> 00:10:22,640
to be right

314
00:10:22,640 --> 00:10:25,120
so we want to reframe this to start

315
00:10:25,120 --> 00:10:26,560
thinking about how

316
00:10:26,560 --> 00:10:28,480
we're collaborating with the person that

317
00:10:28,480 --> 00:10:30,640
we maybe are having a conflict with

318
00:10:30,640 --> 00:10:32,560
it's not about proving that i'm right

319
00:10:32,560 --> 00:10:34,480
it's not about getting my way

320
00:10:34,480 --> 00:10:35,839
it's taking a step back and

321
00:10:35,839 --> 00:10:37,200
understanding what we're trying to

322
00:10:37,200 --> 00:10:38,160
accomplish

323
00:10:38,160 --> 00:10:40,160
and say hey you know what this person

324
00:10:40,160 --> 00:10:42,320
that i actually feel like i'm

325
00:10:42,320 --> 00:10:45,120
at loggerheads with i need to remember

326
00:10:45,120 --> 00:10:45,760
that

327
00:10:45,760 --> 00:10:48,160
we're probably teammates we actually

328
00:10:48,160 --> 00:10:50,000
want the same things

329
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:52,560
and even if we don't we're supposed to

330
00:10:52,560 --> 00:10:53,200
so

331
00:10:53,200 --> 00:10:56,720
how do we how do i look at this person

332
00:10:56,720 --> 00:10:57,839
and you want to reframe to start

333
00:10:57,839 --> 00:10:59,200
thinking about this is a collaborator

334
00:10:59,200 --> 00:11:00,640
we're working together

335
00:11:00,640 --> 00:11:03,680
right this is not my enemy this is not

336
00:11:03,680 --> 00:11:04,399
someone

337
00:11:04,399 --> 00:11:06,959
to win

338
00:11:07,600 --> 00:11:09,839
we want to speak human to human so

339
00:11:09,839 --> 00:11:10,880
here's this is the

340
00:11:10,880 --> 00:11:12,800
at the end of the day these are people

341
00:11:12,800 --> 00:11:14,000
right i can't believe how many times

342
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:15,200
i've said at the end of the day this is

343
00:11:15,200 --> 00:11:16,399
ridiculous

344
00:11:16,399 --> 00:11:18,800
but the people that we're working with

345
00:11:18,800 --> 00:11:20,160
are other humans and we want to

346
00:11:20,160 --> 00:11:21,760
interface with them as

347
00:11:21,760 --> 00:11:24,720
humans they're not just the in just the

348
00:11:24,720 --> 00:11:26,320
thing that i'm hearing

349
00:11:26,320 --> 00:11:28,720
and a phrase that's great for this to to

350
00:11:28,720 --> 00:11:31,200
do mentally is just like me

351
00:11:31,200 --> 00:11:33,120
right so if i'm having conflict with

352
00:11:33,120 --> 00:11:34,399
someone else or i'm talking to someone

353
00:11:34,399 --> 00:11:35,920
else remember this is someone

354
00:11:35,920 --> 00:11:40,160
who wants to be successful just like me

355
00:11:40,160 --> 00:11:42,560
this is someone who doesn't understand

356
00:11:42,560 --> 00:11:44,320
what happened in this incident

357
00:11:44,320 --> 00:11:48,160
just like me this is someone who is

358
00:11:48,160 --> 00:11:50,160
maybe a little uneasy about what's going

359
00:11:50,160 --> 00:11:52,560
on in the world around us right now

360
00:11:52,560 --> 00:11:55,519
just like me you don't necessarily have

361
00:11:55,519 --> 00:11:56,000
to say it

362
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:58,079
out loud but when you're when you're

363
00:11:58,079 --> 00:11:59,680
trying to understand

364
00:11:59,680 --> 00:12:01,839
where someone else is coming from use

365
00:12:01,839 --> 00:12:03,440
that mental phrase

366
00:12:03,440 --> 00:12:06,639
just like me that helps us think about

367
00:12:06,639 --> 00:12:09,040
this as a human to human interaction

368
00:12:09,040 --> 00:12:14,160
this is another person just like me

369
00:12:14,720 --> 00:12:16,800
replacing blame with curiosity remember

370
00:12:16,800 --> 00:12:19,519
this you don't have all the facts

371
00:12:19,519 --> 00:12:21,200
you never do even when you think you do

372
00:12:21,200 --> 00:12:22,399
you really don't there's always

373
00:12:22,399 --> 00:12:23,680
something we don't know

374
00:12:23,680 --> 00:12:24,800
there's the things we don't know we

375
00:12:24,800 --> 00:12:27,040
don't know but so

376
00:12:27,040 --> 00:12:29,519
instead of having our approach to the

377
00:12:29,519 --> 00:12:31,040
interaction being about

378
00:12:31,040 --> 00:12:34,240
blame or fault it's curiosity because

379
00:12:34,240 --> 00:12:34,880
the more

380
00:12:34,880 --> 00:12:37,200
facts that we gather the better we

381
00:12:37,200 --> 00:12:38,320
understand

382
00:12:38,320 --> 00:12:41,519
so if we're pivoting to say my my point

383
00:12:41,519 --> 00:12:42,959
here is not to go find

384
00:12:42,959 --> 00:12:46,240
out why this happened right

385
00:12:46,240 --> 00:12:49,120
but how john allspot that we heard from

386
00:12:49,120 --> 00:12:51,040
before he's got a great blog post called

387
00:12:51,040 --> 00:12:52,480
the infinite house

388
00:12:52,480 --> 00:12:55,200
and how questions are fantastic so think

389
00:12:55,200 --> 00:12:56,639
about but what that what what the

390
00:12:56,639 --> 00:12:58,079
difference from switching between

391
00:12:58,079 --> 00:13:00,399
why and how is really about replacing

392
00:13:00,399 --> 00:13:02,560
blame with curiosity

393
00:13:02,560 --> 00:13:05,440
i'm really interested to understand this

394
00:13:05,440 --> 00:13:07,519
because i'm curious

395
00:13:07,519 --> 00:13:11,600
also that cat is adorable and

396
00:13:11,600 --> 00:13:14,920
how can we do this well we can modeling

397
00:13:14,920 --> 00:13:17,120
vulnerability

398
00:13:17,120 --> 00:13:19,680
and we lead by example whether you're

399
00:13:19,680 --> 00:13:21,920
the official leader of the team or not

400
00:13:21,920 --> 00:13:23,519
everybody whether you're a manager or

401
00:13:23,519 --> 00:13:25,360
not you can be a leader

402
00:13:25,360 --> 00:13:27,839
and how do you lead you lead by example

403
00:13:27,839 --> 00:13:29,839
so creating emotional bonds

404
00:13:29,839 --> 00:13:31,839
does this mean that we have to do like

405
00:13:31,839 --> 00:13:34,000
funky team building exercises and have

406
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:35,519
virtual happy hours

407
00:13:35,519 --> 00:13:37,440
and do all those things not necessarily

408
00:13:37,440 --> 00:13:40,079
but on the other side

409
00:13:40,079 --> 00:13:41,440
sometimes things that might seem a

410
00:13:41,440 --> 00:13:44,399
little silly like icebreakers

411
00:13:44,399 --> 00:13:47,600
getting to know your your teammates

412
00:13:47,600 --> 00:13:50,959
makes them people right and that

413
00:13:50,959 --> 00:13:53,199
and then so so creating those emotional

414
00:13:53,199 --> 00:13:54,720
bonds but another way

415
00:13:54,720 --> 00:13:58,320
is by being vulnerable sharing things

416
00:13:58,320 --> 00:14:00,079
that you're uneasy about

417
00:14:00,079 --> 00:14:02,880
and you start that in a non-stressful

418
00:14:02,880 --> 00:14:03,360
time

419
00:14:03,360 --> 00:14:05,600
right the time to model vulnerability is

420
00:14:05,600 --> 00:14:07,199
not when there's a lot of conflict

421
00:14:07,199 --> 00:14:08,720
but maybe when everything is kind of

422
00:14:08,720 --> 00:14:10,959
going chill that's a good time to kind

423
00:14:10,959 --> 00:14:12,800
of share some things about yourself and

424
00:14:12,800 --> 00:14:13,839
that doesn't mean

425
00:14:13,839 --> 00:14:15,519
your co-workers have to know every

426
00:14:15,519 --> 00:14:16,800
single thing you did and you have to

427
00:14:16,800 --> 00:14:17,760
tell them about

428
00:14:17,760 --> 00:14:19,440
all the things you did over the weekend

429
00:14:19,440 --> 00:14:21,040
and and all this stuff and your

430
00:14:21,040 --> 00:14:22,560
co-workers don't need to know all your

431
00:14:22,560 --> 00:14:23,680
kids names

432
00:14:23,680 --> 00:14:25,279
there's actually a bunch of really

433
00:14:25,279 --> 00:14:26,959
interesting things happening around this

434
00:14:26,959 --> 00:14:30,800
in today's kind of now times

435
00:14:30,800 --> 00:14:32,560
with quarantining and everything a lot

436
00:14:32,560 --> 00:14:34,639
of people working working at home

437
00:14:34,639 --> 00:14:37,279
that aren't used to it we're starting to

438
00:14:37,279 --> 00:14:37,839
actually

439
00:14:37,839 --> 00:14:41,760
learn more about our teammates because

440
00:14:41,760 --> 00:14:43,839
they're kind of having to show the

441
00:14:43,839 --> 00:14:46,399
vulnerability of their home life

442
00:14:46,399 --> 00:14:48,800
we're meeting each other's pets uh our

443
00:14:48,800 --> 00:14:50,320
co-workers kids are running around

444
00:14:50,320 --> 00:14:51,199
behind them we're

445
00:14:51,199 --> 00:14:52,800
we're seeing what their house looks like

446
00:14:52,800 --> 00:14:54,800
maybe and that's actually making people

447
00:14:54,800 --> 00:14:56,800
feel very vulnerable sometimes

448
00:14:56,800 --> 00:14:58,720
but showing that vulnerability shows

449
00:14:58,720 --> 00:15:00,240
that it's okay

450
00:15:00,240 --> 00:15:01,760
and if you are in any kind of a position

451
00:15:01,760 --> 00:15:04,399
of authority it is incumbent upon you to

452
00:15:04,399 --> 00:15:06,639
do this even more because that shows

453
00:15:06,639 --> 00:15:08,959
that it's all right and what happens is

454
00:15:08,959 --> 00:15:10,720
people see this vulnerability

455
00:15:10,720 --> 00:15:14,079
and they see that it doesn't result in

456
00:15:14,079 --> 00:15:15,680
terrible things happening right it's

457
00:15:15,680 --> 00:15:18,320
like hey i told people my cat's name and

458
00:15:18,320 --> 00:15:19,839
it turns out they didn't make fun of me

459
00:15:19,839 --> 00:15:21,519
for the fact that my cat's name

460
00:15:21,519 --> 00:15:24,800
is kubernetes maybe you should

461
00:15:24,800 --> 00:15:27,920
um but that's another story right so now

462
00:15:27,920 --> 00:15:28,639
let's think about

463
00:15:28,639 --> 00:15:30,240
when we're in we've talked about wanting

464
00:15:30,240 --> 00:15:32,639
to replace blame with curiosity

465
00:15:32,639 --> 00:15:34,320
and blamelessness is not just for

466
00:15:34,320 --> 00:15:36,320
postmortems it's not just for that it's

467
00:15:36,320 --> 00:15:38,320
it's always we're always doing this

468
00:15:38,320 --> 00:15:40,079
this kind of learning so i want to be

469
00:15:40,079 --> 00:15:42,800
one be really clear about one thing here

470
00:15:42,800 --> 00:15:44,639
i'm talking about facilitation i'm not

471
00:15:44,639 --> 00:15:47,120
talking about investigation and analysis

472
00:15:47,120 --> 00:15:48,959
so these are some tips about if you're

473
00:15:48,959 --> 00:15:50,800
helping run a meeting

474
00:15:50,800 --> 00:15:52,880
that you want to encourage blamelessness

475
00:15:52,880 --> 00:15:55,360
in so these are not necessarily

476
00:15:55,360 --> 00:15:57,759
directly connected to incident analysis

477
00:15:57,759 --> 00:15:59,120
and the person doing that but this is

478
00:15:59,120 --> 00:16:00,800
maybe someone who's trying to facilitate

479
00:16:00,800 --> 00:16:01,759
the meeting

480
00:16:01,759 --> 00:16:04,000
um whether it's related to a postmortem

481
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:05,360
or just

482
00:16:05,360 --> 00:16:08,800
to a retrospective to anything where you

483
00:16:08,800 --> 00:16:10,560
feel like there's potential risk

484
00:16:10,560 --> 00:16:13,120
for blame right so here's the thing we

485
00:16:13,120 --> 00:16:14,399
talk about blameless a lot and i'm going

486
00:16:14,399 --> 00:16:15,759
to turn it on its ear

487
00:16:15,759 --> 00:16:18,800
so j paul reed kind of has said in his

488
00:16:18,800 --> 00:16:19,680
opinion

489
00:16:19,680 --> 00:16:22,880
that removing blame is almost impossible

490
00:16:22,880 --> 00:16:25,279
because we have millions of years of

491
00:16:25,279 --> 00:16:27,680
evolutionary neurobiology and then

492
00:16:27,680 --> 00:16:30,480
thousands years of social conditioning

493
00:16:30,480 --> 00:16:34,079
that that wire us to use blame

494
00:16:34,079 --> 00:16:36,399
to give voice to these painful and

495
00:16:36,399 --> 00:16:38,079
uncomfortable feelings

496
00:16:38,079 --> 00:16:39,920
so instead we want to think paul will

497
00:16:39,920 --> 00:16:41,680
tell us we want to think about being

498
00:16:41,680 --> 00:16:44,880
blame aware so if we're aware of this

499
00:16:44,880 --> 00:16:46,240
tendency

500
00:16:46,240 --> 00:16:48,480
we know it's something people want to do

501
00:16:48,480 --> 00:16:50,639
first of all don't blame people for for

502
00:16:50,639 --> 00:16:51,360
blaming

503
00:16:51,360 --> 00:16:53,440
because that's not only is it meta it's

504
00:16:53,440 --> 00:16:54,720
also terrible

505
00:16:54,720 --> 00:16:56,639
but uh but if you blame people for

506
00:16:56,639 --> 00:16:58,320
blaming i'm not blaming you

507
00:16:58,320 --> 00:17:00,800
and we could i could do this all day but

508
00:17:00,800 --> 00:17:02,000
if we're aware of it there's things we

509
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:03,199
want to think about because

510
00:17:03,199 --> 00:17:05,359
our tendency even if you have a great

511
00:17:05,359 --> 00:17:06,880
culture in your organization even if

512
00:17:06,880 --> 00:17:07,839
everybody

513
00:17:07,839 --> 00:17:10,079
has like watched all the talks and read

514
00:17:10,079 --> 00:17:11,839
all the blog posts and listen to all the

515
00:17:11,839 --> 00:17:12,959
podcasts

516
00:17:12,959 --> 00:17:15,520
we still always want to go in this place

517
00:17:15,520 --> 00:17:16,880
so it's really helpful

518
00:17:16,880 --> 00:17:19,599
to have someone actively thinking about

519
00:17:19,599 --> 00:17:22,640
helping facilitate this

520
00:17:22,640 --> 00:17:24,720
so what's the role of a facilitator

521
00:17:24,720 --> 00:17:26,480
right so in a conversation if you're

522
00:17:26,480 --> 00:17:28,160
helping facilitate

523
00:17:28,160 --> 00:17:30,000
it's a specific role and it's different

524
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:32,080
than a participant

525
00:17:32,080 --> 00:17:35,360
so one thing is uh one one things to

526
00:17:35,360 --> 00:17:37,840
remember in the role of the facilitator

527
00:17:37,840 --> 00:17:40,240
is encouraging people to speak up and

528
00:17:40,240 --> 00:17:43,440
also making sure that everyone is heard

529
00:17:43,440 --> 00:17:45,200
this can be a little tricky because some

530
00:17:45,200 --> 00:17:46,799
people are not comfortable so going

531
00:17:46,799 --> 00:17:47,760
around and

532
00:17:47,760 --> 00:17:50,080
and calling on people they may have a

533
00:17:50,080 --> 00:17:51,679
reason they didn't speak up

534
00:17:51,679 --> 00:17:53,679
but you want to be observant if there

535
00:17:53,679 --> 00:17:55,200
are folks who have been trying

536
00:17:55,200 --> 00:17:56,880
whether through verbal or nonverbal

537
00:17:56,880 --> 00:17:59,679
signals to get their word in edgewise

538
00:17:59,679 --> 00:18:01,520
and be able to facilitate and maybe say

539
00:18:01,520 --> 00:18:03,679
hey you know what joe

540
00:18:03,679 --> 00:18:06,400
i think that that sally is trying to to

541
00:18:06,400 --> 00:18:08,080
make a point here can we hear from her

542
00:18:08,080 --> 00:18:08,880
now

543
00:18:08,880 --> 00:18:13,440
and one of the key indicators of a team

544
00:18:13,440 --> 00:18:15,840
with high psychological safety

545
00:18:15,840 --> 00:18:18,320
is that team members all tend to speak

546
00:18:18,320 --> 00:18:18,880
in

547
00:18:18,880 --> 00:18:21,440
roughly equal increments in equal

548
00:18:21,440 --> 00:18:23,280
amounts it's evenly distributed you

549
00:18:23,280 --> 00:18:24,880
don't have this one person

550
00:18:24,880 --> 00:18:27,919
that's talking all the time the

551
00:18:27,919 --> 00:18:29,679
facilitator helps clarify

552
00:18:29,679 --> 00:18:31,840
insights and can challenge the team with

553
00:18:31,840 --> 00:18:32,720
questions

554
00:18:32,720 --> 00:18:34,240
right so when it when something is

555
00:18:34,240 --> 00:18:36,720
brought up the facility can help

556
00:18:36,720 --> 00:18:39,600
repeat it maybe clarify it if it if it

557
00:18:39,600 --> 00:18:41,840
seems

558
00:18:41,840 --> 00:18:44,880
and then also ask questions right ask

559
00:18:44,880 --> 00:18:46,080
follow-up questions

560
00:18:46,080 --> 00:18:47,440
i i like to think about being a

561
00:18:47,440 --> 00:18:49,679
facilitator it's a little bit like being

562
00:18:49,679 --> 00:18:51,280
a podcast host i have a little bit of

563
00:18:51,280 --> 00:18:52,160
experience in this

564
00:18:52,160 --> 00:18:54,840
and one of the things i find uh is

565
00:18:54,840 --> 00:18:57,200
essential uh in my role as a podcast

566
00:18:57,200 --> 00:18:59,520
host is to be the audience proxy

567
00:18:59,520 --> 00:19:01,039
to ask questions on behalf of the

568
00:19:01,039 --> 00:19:02,640
audience even though i might know the

569
00:19:02,640 --> 00:19:03,520
answer

570
00:19:03,520 --> 00:19:05,840
so as a facilitator you can proxy other

571
00:19:05,840 --> 00:19:07,120
people in the room

572
00:19:07,120 --> 00:19:09,360
who may not feel comfortable asking the

573
00:19:09,360 --> 00:19:10,400
question

574
00:19:10,400 --> 00:19:12,240
so questions you think people might have

575
00:19:12,240 --> 00:19:13,840
even if you feel like you know the

576
00:19:13,840 --> 00:19:15,600
answer

577
00:19:15,600 --> 00:19:19,120
you can bring those up a facilitator

578
00:19:19,120 --> 00:19:21,360
also helps the team see different angles

579
00:19:21,360 --> 00:19:22,720
and different options

580
00:19:22,720 --> 00:19:25,120
so as a facilitator you can again it's

581
00:19:25,120 --> 00:19:26,559
partially it's different questions but

582
00:19:26,559 --> 00:19:27,840
being able to say hey

583
00:19:27,840 --> 00:19:30,880
this doesn't quite sound like

584
00:19:30,880 --> 00:19:32,160
like we're seeing this from all the

585
00:19:32,160 --> 00:19:33,679
different angles where it might happen

586
00:19:33,679 --> 00:19:35,360
so being able to kind of ask those

587
00:19:35,360 --> 00:19:36,320
questions

588
00:19:36,320 --> 00:19:39,520
or ask things to be reframed and then

589
00:19:39,520 --> 00:19:41,440
again part of it is a little bit of

590
00:19:41,440 --> 00:19:42,400
housekeeping

591
00:19:42,400 --> 00:19:44,640
so keeping everyone on time and on track

592
00:19:44,640 --> 00:19:46,559
it's really easy to go off on tangents

593
00:19:46,559 --> 00:19:47,919
and sometimes tangents are really

594
00:19:47,919 --> 00:19:48,799
interesting

595
00:19:48,799 --> 00:19:50,160
and sometimes they help us discover

596
00:19:50,160 --> 00:19:52,720
things we didn't know otherwise but

597
00:19:52,720 --> 00:19:54,880
keep an eye on where that's going and

598
00:19:54,880 --> 00:19:55,840
really again

599
00:19:55,840 --> 00:19:57,360
keeping things on track and trying to

600
00:19:57,360 --> 00:19:59,039
keep people from dominating the entire

601
00:19:59,039 --> 00:20:00,640
meeting

602
00:20:00,640 --> 00:20:02,320
a couple things to keep in mind about

603
00:20:02,320 --> 00:20:04,480
being a facilitator the facilitator

604
00:20:04,480 --> 00:20:05,840
if you're the facilitator you're not

605
00:20:05,840 --> 00:20:07,919
there to make decisions

606
00:20:07,919 --> 00:20:10,320
right you're not the boss of the meeting

607
00:20:10,320 --> 00:20:11,120
uh

608
00:20:11,120 --> 00:20:14,000
also try to not take sides this is hard

609
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:14,720
because you're

610
00:20:14,720 --> 00:20:15,919
you're still a human you're not a

611
00:20:15,919 --> 00:20:18,080
facilitator but right you're gonna have

612
00:20:18,080 --> 00:20:19,679
opinions you're gonna have things

613
00:20:19,679 --> 00:20:21,919
but really try to be as impartial as you

614
00:20:21,919 --> 00:20:22,880
can

615
00:20:22,880 --> 00:20:25,440
um when it comes to that and again that

616
00:20:25,440 --> 00:20:27,039
being said try to speak as little as

617
00:20:27,039 --> 00:20:29,200
possible you may be surprised

618
00:20:29,200 --> 00:20:31,520
to hear that i don't like facilitating

619
00:20:31,520 --> 00:20:32,880
meetings because it means i don't get to

620
00:20:32,880 --> 00:20:33,760
talk a lot

621
00:20:33,760 --> 00:20:35,200
so i'm a lot better in this kind of a

622
00:20:35,200 --> 00:20:36,480
role but that's the thing as a

623
00:20:36,480 --> 00:20:38,559
facilitator you're not there

624
00:20:38,559 --> 00:20:40,880
to opine you're there to help guide the

625
00:20:40,880 --> 00:20:42,159
meeting

626
00:20:42,159 --> 00:20:44,320
and again that means you're a shadow

627
00:20:44,320 --> 00:20:46,159
that's guiding the discussions

628
00:20:46,159 --> 00:20:48,240
you're not a presenter who takes over

629
00:20:48,240 --> 00:20:50,480
the meeting in so many ways if you think

630
00:20:50,480 --> 00:20:52,400
about podcast hosts that you really like

631
00:20:52,400 --> 00:20:53,919
you'll find they almost are like

632
00:20:53,919 --> 00:20:57,200
facilitators in the episode

633
00:20:57,200 --> 00:20:59,360
and now let's talk finally about

634
00:20:59,360 --> 00:21:00,960
de-escalating conflict

635
00:21:00,960 --> 00:21:04,080
when conflict arises what do we want to

636
00:21:04,080 --> 00:21:06,480
do to help keep this from being

637
00:21:06,480 --> 00:21:09,360
adversarial from being conflict is

638
00:21:09,360 --> 00:21:10,640
incredibly stressful

639
00:21:10,640 --> 00:21:12,640
this is what gets us riled up into our

640
00:21:12,640 --> 00:21:13,679
fight or flight

641
00:21:13,679 --> 00:21:15,760
right and we have a physiological

642
00:21:15,760 --> 00:21:17,440
response to conflict that's

643
00:21:17,440 --> 00:21:20,559
hardwired into us from again all those

644
00:21:20,559 --> 00:21:23,600
eons of evolution right so

645
00:21:23,600 --> 00:21:25,600
how do we help diffuse it so that we can

646
00:21:25,600 --> 00:21:27,440
be productive and we can apply all these

647
00:21:27,440 --> 00:21:30,720
other ideas when we're collaborating

648
00:21:30,720 --> 00:21:32,799
so marshall rosenberg who created the

649
00:21:32,799 --> 00:21:33,840
idea of non-violent

650
00:21:33,840 --> 00:21:37,440
um uh conflict is

651
00:21:37,440 --> 00:21:39,440
has said this says you know we do not

652
00:21:39,440 --> 00:21:41,039
look for compromise

653
00:21:41,039 --> 00:21:43,039
rather we seek to resolve the conflict

654
00:21:43,039 --> 00:21:45,679
to everyone's complete satisfaction

655
00:21:45,679 --> 00:21:47,840
i've i've told my kids before that a

656
00:21:47,840 --> 00:21:49,120
compromise

657
00:21:49,120 --> 00:21:50,960
is what happens when none of us are

658
00:21:50,960 --> 00:21:52,480
happy uh

659
00:21:52,480 --> 00:21:54,480
we that's what we're trying to do we're

660
00:21:54,480 --> 00:21:56,400
actually trying to resolve this and make

661
00:21:56,400 --> 00:21:58,320
sure everybody is happy and believe it

662
00:21:58,320 --> 00:21:59,120
or not

663
00:21:59,120 --> 00:22:02,240
that is possible if that's the way we're

664
00:22:02,240 --> 00:22:04,159
approaching the problem and approaching

665
00:22:04,159 --> 00:22:05,520
the conflicts is to say

666
00:22:05,520 --> 00:22:07,679
how can we resolve this and have

667
00:22:07,679 --> 00:22:09,600
everybody be completely satisfied

668
00:22:09,600 --> 00:22:11,440
and being completely satisfied does not

669
00:22:11,440 --> 00:22:13,120
mean you get what you want

670
00:22:13,120 --> 00:22:15,360
or get what you asked for at first but

671
00:22:15,360 --> 00:22:16,799
when we're done we are completely

672
00:22:16,799 --> 00:22:17,919
satisfied

673
00:22:17,919 --> 00:22:22,080
with the resolution dave shackleford

674
00:22:22,080 --> 00:22:24,080
has i really like this idea too from a

675
00:22:24,080 --> 00:22:25,679
de-escalation perspective

676
00:22:25,679 --> 00:22:27,679
says you know you can pause things with

677
00:22:27,679 --> 00:22:28,720
force

678
00:22:28,720 --> 00:22:30,960
you know you can just say hey look

679
00:22:30,960 --> 00:22:31,919
everybody

680
00:22:31,919 --> 00:22:34,320
take a break take a breath and you can

681
00:22:34,320 --> 00:22:36,400
be really really active

682
00:22:36,400 --> 00:22:37,919
in shutting things down when things get

683
00:22:37,919 --> 00:22:40,400
heated but you really can't make

684
00:22:40,400 --> 00:22:42,080
meaningful progress until people

685
00:22:42,080 --> 00:22:46,240
feel heard so when someone believes that

686
00:22:46,240 --> 00:22:47,919
their point of view has been understood

687
00:22:47,919 --> 00:22:49,440
and acknowledged and that doesn't mean

688
00:22:49,440 --> 00:22:50,480
they've been agreed with but they've

689
00:22:50,480 --> 00:22:52,000
been acknowledged

690
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:54,159
there is this like visceral response

691
00:22:54,159 --> 00:22:55,520
that happens

692
00:22:55,520 --> 00:22:59,280
we want to be heard so even though you

693
00:22:59,280 --> 00:23:01,200
may have to sometimes just say hey

694
00:23:01,200 --> 00:23:04,240
hang on we got to take a step

695
00:23:04,240 --> 00:23:07,039
i got a little wound up there you want

696
00:23:07,039 --> 00:23:08,400
to make sure everyone has

697
00:23:08,400 --> 00:23:10,000
an involved in the conflict has that

698
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:11,919
opportunity to be heard

699
00:23:11,919 --> 00:23:15,520
and acknowledged so when you think about

700
00:23:15,520 --> 00:23:17,360
i referenced non-violent communication

701
00:23:17,360 --> 00:23:19,919
before and i'll post some links at the

702
00:23:19,919 --> 00:23:20,880
end of this

703
00:23:20,880 --> 00:23:22,320
uh which which you'll be able to find

704
00:23:22,320 --> 00:23:24,400
out a little bit more about these things

705
00:23:24,400 --> 00:23:26,480
but when you look at the the model of

706
00:23:26,480 --> 00:23:29,200
non-violent communication it breaks down

707
00:23:29,200 --> 00:23:30,880
to four things that kind of happen in

708
00:23:30,880 --> 00:23:33,760
this order we start with observations

709
00:23:33,760 --> 00:23:37,039
we move on to feelings uh we we then

710
00:23:37,039 --> 00:23:38,480
there are needs and there are requests

711
00:23:38,480 --> 00:23:39,840
we're going to kind of talk about all of

712
00:23:39,840 --> 00:23:40,559
these

713
00:23:40,559 --> 00:23:41,760
and you're going to see a little bit of

714
00:23:41,760 --> 00:23:44,080
a pattern when it comes to what makes

715
00:23:44,080 --> 00:23:45,840
this work

716
00:23:45,840 --> 00:23:48,080
so when we think about observations what

717
00:23:48,080 --> 00:23:50,480
what does that mean and

718
00:23:50,480 --> 00:23:53,760
it's it's what i observe what do i

719
00:23:53,760 --> 00:23:56,880
see what do i hear what do i remember

720
00:23:56,880 --> 00:24:00,480
free from evaluations so just the facts

721
00:24:00,480 --> 00:24:03,520
right the facts of observation i'm not

722
00:24:03,520 --> 00:24:05,760
evaluating them i'm not trying to

723
00:24:05,760 --> 00:24:07,440
understand them i'm just saying what is

724
00:24:07,440 --> 00:24:07,840
the

725
00:24:07,840 --> 00:24:10,880
data what am i observing that

726
00:24:10,880 --> 00:24:14,000
does or does not contribute to my

727
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:15,039
well-being

728
00:24:15,039 --> 00:24:18,640
so for example when i see this happen

729
00:24:18,640 --> 00:24:21,679
when i hear these words but the flip

730
00:24:21,679 --> 00:24:22,480
side of that

731
00:24:22,480 --> 00:24:24,000
that we want to understand we want to

732
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:25,760
think about that

733
00:24:25,760 --> 00:24:28,960
and then what do you observe

734
00:24:28,960 --> 00:24:30,640
that does not contribute to your

735
00:24:30,640 --> 00:24:33,279
well-being and this isn't necessarily me

736
00:24:33,279 --> 00:24:36,400
asking you this because empathy

737
00:24:36,400 --> 00:24:39,200
may make this non-verbal and unsaid but

738
00:24:39,200 --> 00:24:41,760
because i'm trying to be empathetic

739
00:24:41,760 --> 00:24:45,200
i want to say i want to try to evaluate

740
00:24:45,200 --> 00:24:48,400
not evaluate i want to try to observe

741
00:24:48,400 --> 00:24:50,640
the things that do or do not contribute

742
00:24:50,640 --> 00:24:51,760
to your

743
00:24:51,760 --> 00:24:54,880
well-being and then when we think about

744
00:24:54,880 --> 00:24:55,520
the feeling

745
00:24:55,520 --> 00:24:57,520
about feelings right so feelings are how

746
00:24:57,520 --> 00:25:00,240
i feel an emotion or a sensation

747
00:25:00,240 --> 00:25:02,960
rather than thought in relation to what

748
00:25:02,960 --> 00:25:03,279
obs

749
00:25:03,279 --> 00:25:06,400
i observe so it's like i feel scared i

750
00:25:06,400 --> 00:25:08,000
feel threatened i feel

751
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:12,240
angry i feel prickly right like i mean

752
00:25:12,240 --> 00:25:13,360
you know you kind of get that pins and

753
00:25:13,360 --> 00:25:14,080
needles thing

754
00:25:14,080 --> 00:25:17,440
that's a feeling right related to

755
00:25:17,440 --> 00:25:19,840
that observation that just came in and

756
00:25:19,840 --> 00:25:20,960
then likewise

757
00:25:20,960 --> 00:25:22,960
on the person that you're having the

758
00:25:22,960 --> 00:25:24,080
conflict with

759
00:25:24,080 --> 00:25:27,520
how do they feel in relation to what

760
00:25:27,520 --> 00:25:30,880
you observe right so it's i feel and you

761
00:25:30,880 --> 00:25:31,440
feel

762
00:25:31,440 --> 00:25:32,799
and you're not telling someone how they

763
00:25:32,799 --> 00:25:36,080
feel you're wanting to understand that

764
00:25:36,080 --> 00:25:39,520
and then the needs right so needs are

765
00:25:39,520 --> 00:25:43,679
what do i need or value that causes my

766
00:25:43,679 --> 00:25:45,760
feelings right and this is not a

767
00:25:45,760 --> 00:25:47,679
preference it's not even necessarily a

768
00:25:47,679 --> 00:25:49,120
specific action

769
00:25:49,120 --> 00:25:53,439
right it could but it could be i need

770
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:56,799
you to to to let me finish my sentence

771
00:25:56,799 --> 00:25:57,760
right i need to

772
00:25:57,760 --> 00:26:00,400
i need you i it's not even what i need i

773
00:26:00,400 --> 00:26:01,919
need to be heard

774
00:26:01,919 --> 00:26:05,360
right i value because because

775
00:26:05,360 --> 00:26:08,960
i value being acknowledged

776
00:26:08,960 --> 00:26:12,000
and then likewise what do what what do

777
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:12,640
they need

778
00:26:12,640 --> 00:26:15,840
or value and then this comes all the way

779
00:26:15,840 --> 00:26:17,600
back down to request this is when the

780
00:26:17,600 --> 00:26:19,360
actionable stuff happens

781
00:26:19,360 --> 00:26:21,360
but you can't get here if you haven't

782
00:26:21,360 --> 00:26:23,120
led yourself up to it

783
00:26:23,120 --> 00:26:25,600
with the observations the feelings and

784
00:26:25,600 --> 00:26:26,880
the needs

785
00:26:26,880 --> 00:26:30,080
so requests are clearly requesting that

786
00:26:30,080 --> 00:26:31,120
which would enrich

787
00:26:31,120 --> 00:26:34,159
my life without demanding notice a

788
00:26:34,159 --> 00:26:35,919
difference it is a request that is not a

789
00:26:35,919 --> 00:26:37,200
demand it is not

790
00:26:37,200 --> 00:26:40,799
mike i need mike do this mike please do

791
00:26:40,799 --> 00:26:42,720
that it is a request i'm saying i'm

792
00:26:42,720 --> 00:26:43,760
asking you

793
00:26:43,760 --> 00:26:46,240
to do this and then likewise i need to

794
00:26:46,240 --> 00:26:47,279
empathetically

795
00:26:47,279 --> 00:26:49,919
empathetically receive what would enrich

796
00:26:49,919 --> 00:26:50,799
your life

797
00:26:50,799 --> 00:26:52,640
without hearing it as a demand and

798
00:26:52,640 --> 00:26:54,000
that's that's

799
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:56,720
really hard right but if we're if we're

800
00:26:56,720 --> 00:26:58,640
focusing on it and saying this is this

801
00:26:58,640 --> 00:27:01,200
is not a demand it is a request

802
00:27:01,200 --> 00:27:03,679
even maybe if it's phrased as a demand

803
00:27:03,679 --> 00:27:05,520
i'm going to receive it

804
00:27:05,520 --> 00:27:09,279
as a request and these are basically

805
00:27:09,279 --> 00:27:11,120
requests are concrete actions that i

806
00:27:11,120 --> 00:27:12,159
would like taken

807
00:27:12,159 --> 00:27:14,159
and again it's a request so it's would

808
00:27:14,159 --> 00:27:16,320
you be willing

809
00:27:16,320 --> 00:27:19,440
to write this up would you be willing

810
00:27:19,440 --> 00:27:22,480
to rephrase that question and ask it

811
00:27:22,480 --> 00:27:24,080
slightly differently

812
00:27:24,080 --> 00:27:27,840
and then i want the same thing right

813
00:27:27,840 --> 00:27:30,480
i and again i may need to kind of

814
00:27:30,480 --> 00:27:32,240
empathetically receive these you may not

815
00:27:32,240 --> 00:27:34,559
be explicit with them but what are the

816
00:27:34,559 --> 00:27:35,600
concrete actions

817
00:27:35,600 --> 00:27:38,799
you would like taken as well so

818
00:27:38,799 --> 00:27:42,240
i may ask this and say would you like

819
00:27:42,240 --> 00:27:46,399
this to happen or it may have to go

820
00:27:46,840 --> 00:27:49,840
unstated

821
00:27:50,399 --> 00:27:52,399
here here's what it's all about and uh

822
00:27:52,399 --> 00:27:54,799
it's a co it's it's an often quoted

823
00:27:54,799 --> 00:27:56,720
african proverb but hey if you want to

824
00:27:56,720 --> 00:27:57,840
go fast

825
00:27:57,840 --> 00:28:02,159
go alone if you want to go far

826
00:28:02,159 --> 00:28:04,880
go together

827
00:28:05,200 --> 00:28:08,240
i will have this deck available probably

828
00:28:08,240 --> 00:28:10,240
in about in a few minutes after we're

829
00:28:10,240 --> 00:28:11,760
done with q a uh

830

00:28:36,559 --> 00:28:38,960
couple of questions cued up here

843
00:28:38,960 --> 00:28:42,080
uh one of them is uh how do you

844
00:28:42,080 --> 00:28:45,039
return against the trust and

845
00:28:45,039 --> 00:28:46,640
psychological safety

846
00:28:46,640 --> 00:28:49,600
in a team after several conflicts how do

847
00:28:49,600 --> 00:28:51,840
you return to having it i guess as

848
00:28:51,840 --> 00:28:54,640
if you've had several conflicts right

849
00:28:54,640 --> 00:28:56,080
well that's the thing it's a continuum

850
00:28:56,080 --> 00:28:58,240
right and so this is not an end state

851
00:28:58,240 --> 00:28:59,600
that you've achieved psychological

852
00:28:59,600 --> 00:29:01,200
safety we've done all the things now

853
00:29:01,200 --> 00:29:02,799
we're done take the box and it will

854
00:29:02,799 --> 00:29:03,200
never

855
00:29:03,200 --> 00:29:05,600
disappear it's something we have to

856
00:29:05,600 --> 00:29:06,720
continue to work at

857
00:29:06,720 --> 00:29:09,919
so i think if the same steps

858
00:29:09,919 --> 00:29:12,559
and and things that are important for

859
00:29:12,559 --> 00:29:14,240
trying to foster it when it doesn't

860
00:29:14,240 --> 00:29:16,480
originally exist but part of that is

861
00:29:16,480 --> 00:29:18,000
also going to be about acknowledgement

862
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:20,080
so if you go back and you think about

863
00:29:20,080 --> 00:29:23,919
the non-violent um communication

864
00:29:23,919 --> 00:29:26,960
we want to say okay what was the thing

865
00:29:26,960 --> 00:29:27,919
that happened

866
00:29:27,919 --> 00:29:30,240
and doing it in a blame-free way but we

867
00:29:30,240 --> 00:29:31,840
need to acknowledge it

868
00:29:31,840 --> 00:29:33,360
right and and say this was a thing that

869
00:29:33,360 --> 00:29:36,000
happened it's not a thing that you did

870
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:38,880
or a thing that you are but we had this

871
00:29:38,880 --> 00:29:41,520
conflict and it did not resolve well

872
00:29:41,520 --> 00:29:43,840
so hey you know we can do retros and

873
00:29:43,840 --> 00:29:45,919
post-mortems not just about when

874
00:29:45,919 --> 00:29:48,399
our technical systems fail so being able

875
00:29:48,399 --> 00:29:49,279
to continually

876
00:29:49,279 --> 00:29:51,360
look at that and and if if it's if you

877
00:29:51,360 --> 00:29:52,720
in a team where you feel like this has

878
00:29:52,720 --> 00:29:54,640
been going really well

879
00:29:54,640 --> 00:29:56,880
and then it deviates you kind of have to

880
00:29:56,880 --> 00:29:58,399
double down on it a little bit and make

881
00:29:58,399 --> 00:30:01,039
it a more important focus

882
00:30:01,039 --> 00:30:05,200
gotcha then another question is

883
00:30:05,200 --> 00:30:08,720
what uh let's see here what should be

884
00:30:08,720 --> 00:30:11,919
changed first in

885
00:30:11,919 --> 00:30:16,080
first of all in a team uh with low

886
00:30:16,080 --> 00:30:19,279
psychological safety i

887
00:30:19,279 --> 00:30:22,480
i think one of the most powerful ones to

888
00:30:22,480 --> 00:30:23,200
start with

889
00:30:23,200 --> 00:30:26,159
is someone in a leadership role modeling

890
00:30:26,159 --> 00:30:27,039
vulnerability

891
00:30:27,039 --> 00:30:30,879
that's that's very very effective

892
00:30:31,039 --> 00:30:34,720
it's it's also important to agree as a

893
00:30:34,720 --> 00:30:36,320
team that this is something that is

894
00:30:36,320 --> 00:30:39,360
important to you uh a lot of team if it

895
00:30:39,360 --> 00:30:41,440
especially if it's a team that is not ad

896
00:30:41,440 --> 00:30:42,399
hoc

897
00:30:42,399 --> 00:30:45,440
um having some type of a charter

898
00:30:45,440 --> 00:30:47,200
that says we we believe this to be

899
00:30:47,200 --> 00:30:49,120
important and we're going to continue to

900
00:30:49,120 --> 00:30:50,480
talk about so i think the very first

901
00:30:50,480 --> 00:30:52,480
thing is to agree that you want to make

902
00:30:52,480 --> 00:30:53,840
it happen

903
00:30:53,840 --> 00:30:55,919
and and and come to and and and have

904
00:30:55,919 --> 00:30:57,679
everybody be on board with that

905
00:30:57,679 --> 00:30:59,519
um or at least as many people as

906
00:30:59,519 --> 00:31:01,039
possible right

907
00:31:01,039 --> 00:31:03,279
so then we have another one that says

908
00:31:03,279 --> 00:31:04,399
here

909
00:31:04,399 --> 00:31:06,799
uh how do you foster productivity

910
00:31:06,799 --> 00:31:08,640
friction

911
00:31:08,640 --> 00:31:11,600
how do you foster productivity friction

912
00:31:11,600 --> 00:31:13,039
uh i'm not 100

913
00:31:13,039 --> 00:31:15,360
sure i know what productivity friction

914
00:31:15,360 --> 00:31:16,159
is

915
00:31:16,159 --> 00:31:19,600
i i also not knowing it fostering it

916
00:31:19,600 --> 00:31:20,880
seems like it seems like a thing you

917
00:31:20,880 --> 00:31:22,000
wouldn't want

918
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:24,399
uh i do think that one of the key things

919
00:31:24,399 --> 00:31:25,519
and we don't have the time to go into

920
00:31:25,519 --> 00:31:26,080
this but

921
00:31:26,080 --> 00:31:28,559
going back to state of devops report

922
00:31:28,559 --> 00:31:30,640
productivity is a very interesting

923
00:31:30,640 --> 00:31:32,000
measure and we usually measure

924
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:35,200
it incorrectly right so so i don't i

925
00:31:35,200 --> 00:31:36,480
don't really know the question hey pop

926
00:31:36,480 --> 00:31:38,159
into if you're in the slack um

927
00:31:38,159 --> 00:31:40,080
after after i'm done here give me a

928
00:31:40,080 --> 00:31:41,360
little bit more framing on what you're

929
00:31:41,360 --> 00:31:42,799
talking about and i'm happy to

930
00:31:42,799 --> 00:31:45,360
to help with that um and then today i

931
00:31:45,360 --> 00:31:46,000
learned a thing

932
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:48,880
or i'm about to learn a thing and then

933
00:31:48,880 --> 00:31:50,159
one last question

934
00:31:50,159 --> 00:31:53,760
is uh do you have any tips uh

935
00:31:53,760 --> 00:31:56,960
to let's see for me to get

936
00:31:56,960 --> 00:31:58,880
other team members to engage in a

937
00:31:58,880 --> 00:32:01,039
meeting

938
00:32:01,039 --> 00:32:02,960
so that's a really hard one because

939
00:32:02,960 --> 00:32:04,399
people have different preferences right

940
00:32:04,399 --> 00:32:06,000
so sometimes if people aren't speaking

941
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:07,760
up and they're not engaging it's because

942
00:32:07,760 --> 00:32:09,840
they're just not necessarily comfortable

943
00:32:09,840 --> 00:32:11,519
with that and calling on them is really

944
00:32:11,519 --> 00:32:13,360
hard

945
00:32:13,360 --> 00:32:15,600
so you you need to use a little bit of

946
00:32:15,600 --> 00:32:17,039
your of your judgment

947
00:32:17,039 --> 00:32:21,360
um sometimes it is a matter of

948
00:32:21,360 --> 00:32:23,600
reinforcing the behavior that you want

949
00:32:23,600 --> 00:32:25,279
as well because even people that don't

950
00:32:25,279 --> 00:32:27,039
contribute a lot

951
00:32:27,039 --> 00:32:28,960
will contribute sometimes and when they

952
00:32:28,960 --> 00:32:31,200
do i don't want to say so you don't have

953
00:32:31,200 --> 00:32:33,840
to be like oh yay mike said something

954
00:32:33,840 --> 00:32:35,440
yay let's have a you know do a lot of

955
00:32:35,440 --> 00:32:37,519
slack emojis or whatever

956
00:32:37,519 --> 00:32:40,720
but recognize it you know sometimes all

957
00:32:40,720 --> 00:32:42,159
it takes is just saying wow that's a

958
00:32:42,159 --> 00:32:42,960
really good

959
00:32:42,960 --> 00:32:46,559
point like those are easy to do

960
00:32:46,559 --> 00:32:48,320
and they make a huge difference and we

961
00:32:48,320 --> 00:32:50,080
all think so i just told you that and

962
00:32:50,080 --> 00:32:51,360
you everybody just

963
00:32:51,360 --> 00:32:53,679
was like oh that wouldn't work on me i

964
00:32:53,679 --> 00:32:55,039
would see right through that and you

965
00:32:55,039 --> 00:32:56,799
know what you're all liars

966
00:32:56,799 --> 00:32:58,640
it would 100 work and you wouldn't even

967
00:32:58,640 --> 00:33:00,080
know it was happening so

968
00:33:00,080 --> 00:33:02,480
little things like that because re it's

969
00:33:02,480 --> 00:33:04,559
easier to reinforce

970
00:33:04,559 --> 00:33:07,360
positive the behavior that you want than

971
00:33:07,360 --> 00:33:08,080
it is to

972
00:33:08,080 --> 00:33:09,840
um but it but you have to it has to

973
00:33:09,840 --> 00:33:11,360
happen and so you have to really have

974
00:33:11,360 --> 00:33:13,360
your eyes open for it

975
00:33:13,360 --> 00:33:15,440
gotcha thank you well thank you very

976
00:33:15,440 --> 00:33:17,600
