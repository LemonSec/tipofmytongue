1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:04,650
is and immediately anyway so let's

2
00:00:04,650 --> 00:00:07,350
simply like I'll put in start with my

3
00:00:07,350 --> 00:00:12,799
statutory and then go from there

4
00:00:12,799 --> 00:00:15,870
first of all thanks lamp and the factory

5
00:00:15,870 --> 00:00:17,910
and all the organized with volunteers

6
00:00:17,910 --> 00:00:20,010
twelve all the docks only it's so

7
00:00:20,010 --> 00:00:23,430
amazing to see amazing speakers speaking

8
00:00:23,430 --> 00:00:25,590
different being at different angles and

9
00:00:25,590 --> 00:00:28,410
speak about interesting puppets

10
00:00:28,410 --> 00:00:31,610
then we are talk more about how to build

11
00:00:31,610 --> 00:00:35,309
scalable and more beginner really bad

12
00:00:35,309 --> 00:00:40,140
echo so I think you need to just like

13
00:00:40,140 --> 00:00:43,800
your might speak of it okay let me try

14
00:00:43,800 --> 00:00:51,840
bringing that closer is it it's better

15
00:00:51,840 --> 00:01:05,610
but there's still an echo like you need

16
00:01:05,610 --> 00:01:07,470
to turn off your speaker volume so you

17
00:01:07,470 --> 00:01:17,909
don't hear yourself I really think I'm

18
00:01:17,909 --> 00:01:20,420
good I mean think everything's off

19
00:01:20,420 --> 00:01:26,640
are you think huh no right okay great so

20
00:01:26,640 --> 00:01:29,939
all that we can to get started with

21
00:01:29,939 --> 00:01:33,659
decision right right now there's turn

22
00:01:33,659 --> 00:01:35,990
echo

23
00:01:41,690 --> 00:01:44,759
[Music]

24
00:01:56,090 --> 00:01:58,380
well it's gone but you're also muted

25
00:01:58,380 --> 00:02:14,000
it's kinda cool they just did the

26
00:02:14,480 --> 00:02:20,000
everybody can sing clear speakers maybe

27
00:02:20,630 --> 00:02:33,650
is it better now still here on me Venkat

28
00:02:33,650 --> 00:02:40,020
I think Venkat suggesting you put in

29
00:02:40,020 --> 00:02:43,970
some earbuds or headphones or something

30
00:02:43,970 --> 00:02:48,530
and put your speaker to that

31
00:03:17,840 --> 00:03:30,740
now can you try and meeting and still

32
00:03:30,740 --> 00:03:40,370
trying to act okay I waited in this

33
00:03:40,370 --> 00:03:42,980
house but it did work fine

34
00:03:42,980 --> 00:03:46,880
in the middle man I gotta be a chicken

35
00:03:46,880 --> 00:03:53,109
victim instead you still hear that echo

36
00:03:53,680 --> 00:03:58,300
no tears to begun no here's to be gone

37
00:03:58,300 --> 00:04:00,980
okay okay we should be good to

38
00:04:00,980 --> 00:04:03,860

41
00:04:29,110 --> 00:04:39,960
oh good I believe a good uh okay

42
00:04:41,040 --> 00:04:54,100
not much still there maybe if you just

43
00:04:54,100 --> 00:04:58,090
use like the same microphone from your

44
00:04:58,090 --> 00:05:04,650
headphones yeah I'm just playing that

45
00:05:42,430 --> 00:05:44,949
but is this fine enough this is fine I

46
00:05:44,949 --> 00:05:48,729
mean you never see my screen and like is

47
00:05:48,729 --> 00:05:51,130
Nico still there is you're still not

48
00:05:51,130 --> 00:06:00,120
going I think surprising to me really I

49
00:06:02,639 --> 00:06:12,160
only find it surprising why did I change

50
00:06:12,160 --> 00:06:20,110
I didn't change the audio can you turn

51
00:06:20,110 --> 00:06:27,820
off the speaker like in those settings

52
00:06:27,820 --> 00:06:29,260
right there you see Mike and then their

53
00:06:29,260 --> 00:06:33,460
speaker the possible just disable the

54
00:06:33,460 --> 00:06:39,160
speaker yeah and have you done all these

55
00:06:39,160 --> 00:06:41,229
people is it is it is it knocking not

56
00:06:41,229 --> 00:06:50,070
echoing now if you can show me it yeah

57
00:06:50,070 --> 00:06:54,060
now I mean still

58
00:06:55,850 --> 00:06:58,910
[Music]

59
00:07:39,050 --> 00:07:47,719
is it good you are able to come wait no

60
00:07:47,719 --> 00:07:50,509
I come okay

61
00:07:50,509 --> 00:07:55,219
Oh finally so we'll get quickly started

62
00:07:55,219 --> 00:07:57,680
with the session I don't know what's

63
00:07:57,680 --> 00:08:01,039
like who it was but then I did they say

64
00:08:01,039 --> 00:08:06,139
please let me know man okay so so that's

65
00:08:06,139 --> 00:08:08,029
great I'll quickly get started with the

66
00:08:08,029 --> 00:08:09,740
session and then like I think the

67
00:08:09,740 --> 00:08:12,860
ultimate so take questions in the end so

68
00:08:12,860 --> 00:08:14,689
basically like when it gets that when

69
00:08:14,689 --> 00:08:16,430
you are looking at stuff a deal search

70
00:08:16,430 --> 00:08:18,499
there are various ways to look at doing

71
00:08:18,499 --> 00:08:21,439
search when you are looking to put up

72
00:08:21,439 --> 00:08:23,960
point a in point P and trying to go to

73
00:08:23,960 --> 00:08:26,270
the near Starbucks or any case you're

74
00:08:26,270 --> 00:08:28,879
literally searching on your you

75
00:08:28,879 --> 00:08:30,469
literally searching on a force of tea

76
00:08:30,469 --> 00:08:33,708
that time if I can't pay it with driver

77
00:08:33,708 --> 00:08:36,740
so on uber whenever you try to do this

78
00:08:36,740 --> 00:08:38,958
it's literally a search it was similarly

79
00:08:38,958 --> 00:08:41,299
valuable to something like yell and then

80
00:08:41,299 --> 00:08:43,219
find search for your favorite fish and

81
00:08:43,219 --> 00:08:45,740
order is on like to a take-off or a

82
00:08:45,740 --> 00:08:47,930
holiday or something like that then

83
00:08:47,930 --> 00:08:49,339
you're literally searching for your

84
00:08:49,339 --> 00:08:51,829
fabric food so it's also like a salty

85
00:08:51,829 --> 00:08:53,480
purse which goes to a specific server

86
00:08:53,480 --> 00:08:55,430
and then like you can't get so so search

87
00:08:55,430 --> 00:08:58,190
place very primal and very important a

88
00:08:58,190 --> 00:09:00,500
role in all of these and like helps you

89
00:09:00,500 --> 00:09:03,949
to get that experience of final thing

90
00:09:03,949 --> 00:09:06,050
that you want in at that moment of time

91
00:09:06,050 --> 00:09:09,649
and doing a lot of these things so not

92
00:09:09,649 --> 00:09:11,569
just for search there are many many

93
00:09:11,569 --> 00:09:14,060
other use cases that that search place

94
00:09:14,060 --> 00:09:16,970
are very common and very the Department

95
00:09:16,970 --> 00:09:19,130
will say when you're bright rusty is

96
00:09:19,130 --> 00:09:20,600
more importantly now when you're going

97
00:09:20,600 --> 00:09:23,089
somewhere back in stock or when you're

98
00:09:23,089 --> 00:09:26,660
talking on directs and then to find out

99
00:09:26,660 --> 00:09:28,310
the operational issues from specific

100
00:09:28,310 --> 00:09:30,980
service or even when you are looking at

101
00:09:30,980 --> 00:09:33,440
a PDF document on something like Adobe

102
00:09:33,440 --> 00:09:35,870
so there are many many use cases many

103
00:09:35,870 --> 00:09:38,750
many things that this a common tool so

104
00:09:38,750 --> 00:09:41,089
do you may like sharing your screen I

105
00:09:41,089 --> 00:09:48,319
think maybe you should be okay so so

106
00:09:48,319 --> 00:09:49,340
baby maybe

107
00:09:49,340 --> 00:09:51,590
like you might have searched for you

108
00:09:51,590 --> 00:09:53,810
might have looked into elasticsearch in

109
00:09:53,810 --> 00:09:54,950
the last 24 hours

110
00:09:54,950 --> 00:09:57,610
so elasticsearch is a very very popular

111
00:09:57,610 --> 00:10:01,280
open-source search engine where you can

112
00:10:01,280 --> 00:10:03,320
look at you can look at building the

113
00:10:03,320 --> 00:10:06,170
search cluster and any cloud platform or

114
00:10:06,170 --> 00:10:09,050
in any platform agnostic please and then

115
00:10:09,050 --> 00:10:10,940
they get started and ingest the data

116
00:10:10,940 --> 00:10:13,790
anything and you would get a search

117
00:10:13,790 --> 00:10:17,300
experience so basically the entire stack

118
00:10:17,300 --> 00:10:20,660
is called elastic Stan and then elastic

119
00:10:20,660 --> 00:10:22,430
search is a heart and soul of this that

120
00:10:22,430 --> 00:10:24,800
for the entire stack where it is a

121
00:10:24,800 --> 00:10:27,320
distributed no sequel search based the

122
00:10:27,320 --> 00:10:30,410
rest base search engine it can also be

123
00:10:30,410 --> 00:10:32,480
used like a take a story but then you

124
00:10:32,480 --> 00:10:34,760
also have Cabana you just let your

125
00:10:34,760 --> 00:10:36,680
window into elastic search and through

126
00:10:36,680 --> 00:10:38,450
which you will be able to like kind of

127
00:10:38,450 --> 00:10:41,180
get theta and look at the data which

128
00:10:41,180 --> 00:10:43,400
allies the DEA guy and look at a lot of

129
00:10:43,400 --> 00:10:46,340
these stocks etc beats and logstash

130
00:10:46,340 --> 00:10:48,890
are the other ingestion volumes to which

131
00:10:48,890 --> 00:10:50,900
you be able to push data into elastic

132
00:10:50,900 --> 00:10:53,780
search and then like and then it does a

133
00:10:53,780 --> 00:10:55,580
host of other things now today we are

134
00:10:55,580 --> 00:10:56,900
not going to look more into the

135
00:10:56,900 --> 00:10:59,000
unsuitability part of it we are local

136
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:01,820
much more gonna look at what about the

137
00:11:01,820 --> 00:11:03,800
surf spot but like how to search things

138
00:11:03,800 --> 00:11:06,140
how do you build a search experience on

139
00:11:06,140 --> 00:11:08,060
whatever baby space that people easily

140
00:11:08,060 --> 00:11:11,930
get started so like I said we do three

141
00:11:11,930 --> 00:11:14,300
specific things web search observability

142
00:11:14,300 --> 00:11:15,740
and security which also call this

143
00:11:15,740 --> 00:11:18,110
product so three things three different

144
00:11:18,110 --> 00:11:19,840
areas per search base a very common

145
00:11:19,840 --> 00:11:22,640
constant and foundational road

146
00:11:22,640 --> 00:11:24,320
yeah three different solutions all

147
00:11:24,320 --> 00:11:27,410
powered by single stand I spoke about

148
00:11:27,410 --> 00:11:29,150
this as well like wherein you can deploy

149
00:11:29,150 --> 00:11:32,000
it run and do things we also have a

150
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:33,530
kubernetes operator through which you

151
00:11:33,530 --> 00:11:36,500
would be able to run committees and run

152
00:11:36,500 --> 00:11:39,590
elasticsearch of abilities and and do a

153
00:11:39,590 --> 00:11:42,560
lot of automatic updates and several

154
00:11:42,560 --> 00:11:47,240
other management so stop right now

155
00:11:47,240 --> 00:11:50,060
I'm sorry I think you have a

156
00:11:50,060 --> 00:11:52,850
presentation during you yeah I do have a

157
00:11:52,850 --> 00:11:54,800
presentation and it's mb and we don't

158
00:11:54,800 --> 00:12:00,819
say it okay there it is

159
00:12:00,910 --> 00:12:04,340
okay so a lot of hiccups I am really

160
00:12:04,340 --> 00:12:06,470
sorry and I think a lot of things

161
00:12:06,470 --> 00:12:09,620
getting started so so specifically like

162
00:12:09,620 --> 00:12:12,710
I really shared about how do you get

163
00:12:12,710 --> 00:12:15,980
started with elasticsearch and various

164
00:12:15,980 --> 00:12:19,760
ways to get things so elastic has a

165
00:12:19,760 --> 00:12:22,370
specific search related solution called

166
00:12:22,370 --> 00:12:24,620
elastic and research through which you

167
00:12:24,620 --> 00:12:26,390
will be able to build search legged

168
00:12:26,390 --> 00:12:29,480
experiences within minutes alright to

169
00:12:29,480 --> 00:12:31,190
get started about elastic search before

170
00:12:31,190 --> 00:12:34,010
we go in to look at Hawaiian assets such

171
00:12:34,010 --> 00:12:36,860
as so popular and also like one biggest

172
00:12:36,860 --> 00:12:37,730
use cases

173
00:12:37,730 --> 00:12:40,550
now I said it's stipulated no sequel

174
00:12:40,550 --> 00:12:42,890
that has problems just a being able you

175
00:12:42,890 --> 00:12:45,140
could build this faster you could people

176
00:12:45,140 --> 00:12:47,960
go onto this API and do a lot of these

177
00:12:47,960 --> 00:12:51,410
things but in the same point time there

178
00:12:51,410 --> 00:12:53,420
are a lot of other other related things

179
00:12:53,420 --> 00:12:55,160
like building when you're building

180
00:12:55,160 --> 00:12:57,770
search you want to be faster you want to

181
00:12:57,770 --> 00:12:59,750
get features like auto complete type of

182
00:12:59,750 --> 00:13:02,660
Correction preferably analytics from

183
00:13:02,660 --> 00:13:04,880
what's happening in the search looking

184
00:13:04,880 --> 00:13:07,310
at the logs of API is I mean what people

185
00:13:07,310 --> 00:13:09,440
are waiting for and very many other

186
00:13:09,440 --> 00:13:11,750
things that you really don't want mer

187
00:13:11,750 --> 00:13:16,520
bit more of course mostly off so

188
00:13:16,520 --> 00:13:17,810
specifically when you're building search

189
00:13:17,810 --> 00:13:19,550
experience you you literally want to

190
00:13:19,550 --> 00:13:21,350
build a silver bullet experience like

191
00:13:21,350 --> 00:13:23,030
when you want to simulate you want

192
00:13:23,030 --> 00:13:25,300
something that is so easy to build and

193
00:13:25,300 --> 00:13:28,640
something that adds value so that's what

194
00:13:28,640 --> 00:13:30,860
we're gonna see today so quickly move on

195
00:13:30,860 --> 00:13:32,660
that they move because anyway law school

196
00:13:32,660 --> 00:13:33,950
about the pipe so I just want to like

197
00:13:33,950 --> 00:13:36,740
introduce absurd acts such is another

198
00:13:36,740 --> 00:13:39,200
downloadable free to use product that

199
00:13:39,200 --> 00:13:40,790
you would deploy it of any cloud

200
00:13:40,790 --> 00:13:43,850
platform and run it from anywhere I have

201
00:13:43,850 --> 00:13:45,770
or the latest sometime I have sped up

202
00:13:45,770 --> 00:13:50,840
already you know the deployment in the

203
00:13:50,840 --> 00:13:52,700
browser service it could also get

204
00:13:52,700 --> 00:13:55,850
started by downloaded it from elastic

205
00:13:55,850 --> 00:13:58,100
that was last hour loads say acts such

206
00:13:58,100 --> 00:14:00,310
and then you would simply run it anyway

207
00:14:00,310 --> 00:14:03,440
but I have just deployed it in a cloud

208
00:14:03,440 --> 00:14:07,550
platform so when I deployed this I got I

209
00:14:07,550 --> 00:14:10,790
got a username and password and I have

210
00:14:10,790 --> 00:14:12,440
just gone to like

211
00:14:12,440 --> 00:14:15,500
log into this and let's see show you the

212
00:14:15,500 --> 00:14:17,420
console so that we can get in this some

213
00:14:17,420 --> 00:14:20,209
data and speech the subjects begins

214
00:14:20,209 --> 00:14:25,579
right right here like life so when it is

215
00:14:25,579 --> 00:14:26,839
started with the console you will be

216
00:14:26,839 --> 00:14:28,699
shown a non coding experience will be

217
00:14:28,699 --> 00:14:31,279
shown an engine will be asked to build a

218
00:14:31,279 --> 00:14:34,610
search engine say today that we have a

219
00:14:34,610 --> 00:14:37,060
movie state asset so in this we build

220
00:14:37,060 --> 00:14:39,740
saving briefs and we prosecute the

221
00:14:39,740 --> 00:14:41,959
language of shiffman's say English but

222
00:14:41,959 --> 00:14:43,879
I'll keep it universal and then like I

223
00:14:43,879 --> 00:14:45,470
will click continue so you would get

224
00:14:45,470 --> 00:14:47,779
started with the search engine there are

225
00:14:47,779 --> 00:14:50,120
various ways to ingest data let's say

226
00:14:50,120 --> 00:14:52,579
you can use API like the regular API

227
00:14:52,579 --> 00:14:55,879
where you would be given now I mean an

228
00:14:55,879 --> 00:15:00,230
API key or token and then you can ingest

229
00:15:00,230 --> 00:15:01,730
data using that talking through the API

230
00:15:01,730 --> 00:15:04,939
but you can also upload a JSON file or

231
00:15:04,939 --> 00:15:06,680
even a system so what I do is let us

232
00:15:06,680 --> 00:15:10,220
simply face some basic documents so that

233
00:15:10,220 --> 00:15:13,730
so that like we can get started so it's

234
00:15:13,730 --> 00:15:17,449
very interesting to easy to get started

235
00:15:17,449 --> 00:15:19,880
with these respects this specific tool

236
00:15:19,880 --> 00:15:21,860
there is no need of building that

237
00:15:21,860 --> 00:15:25,069
regular elasticsearch faster or there is

238
00:15:25,069 --> 00:15:27,050
no need of doing seven other ticket

239
00:15:27,050 --> 00:15:29,199
arrangement certainly to do in case of

240
00:15:29,199 --> 00:15:31,970
let us say in case of my building this

241
00:15:31,970 --> 00:15:34,370
own open source solution so this is like

242
00:15:34,370 --> 00:15:37,550
a layer on top of your elasticsearch and

243
00:15:37,550 --> 00:15:39,709
then now this helps you to do many

244
00:15:39,709 --> 00:15:42,649
things so a 10x successfully and it also

245
00:15:42,649 --> 00:15:43,970
showed how many documents we haven't

246
00:15:43,970 --> 00:15:46,490
just fit IPTC core visit dashboard part

247
00:15:46,490 --> 00:15:47,930
and so that like you will be able to

248
00:15:47,930 --> 00:15:50,959
kind of like take a look at it so this

249
00:15:50,959 --> 00:15:53,449
is the overall console and then there

250
00:15:53,449 --> 00:15:57,259
are say my tangents financials multiple

251
00:15:57,259 --> 00:15:59,870
tools etcetera so what I will do is like

252
00:15:59,870 --> 00:16:03,170
a quickly both the movie spot and that

253
00:16:03,170 --> 00:16:04,850
the engine that we just created and the

254
00:16:04,850 --> 00:16:06,589
documents are interested and we also see

255
00:16:06,589 --> 00:16:09,230
that there are two parties and I mean

256
00:16:09,230 --> 00:16:12,230
total operational slots etcetera so you

257
00:16:12,230 --> 00:16:14,209
also be presented with the host of

258
00:16:14,209 --> 00:16:16,639
options like say very dust reference UI

259
00:16:16,639 --> 00:16:19,160
documents so documents is nothing but

260
00:16:19,160 --> 00:16:21,319
nothing but of these documents that you

261
00:16:21,319 --> 00:16:22,670
are interested if you want to index more

262
00:16:22,670 --> 00:16:24,800
documents you can go and do that then

263
00:16:24,800 --> 00:16:26,030
you also

264
00:16:26,030 --> 00:16:28,340
have something like very distant

265
00:16:28,340 --> 00:16:30,200
supposing to if you have ingested some

266
00:16:30,200 --> 00:16:34,190
specific movie and let's say like some

267
00:16:34,190 --> 00:16:36,230
data that you want to wake up and test

268
00:16:36,230 --> 00:16:38,360
how the really Lancer you want to see

269
00:16:38,360 --> 00:16:40,430
that way the details you could simply go

270
00:16:40,430 --> 00:16:43,820
and look open up the ear of lilies and

271
00:16:43,820 --> 00:16:46,430
see how the rest body is going on what's

272
00:16:46,430 --> 00:16:47,840
the result that is coming in and like

273
00:16:47,840 --> 00:16:50,990
with this rage of the score of this do

274
00:16:50,990 --> 00:16:52,670
the relevance tuning part as well let's

275
00:16:52,670 --> 00:16:54,350
change that now that's very interesting

276
00:16:54,350 --> 00:16:57,680
to me as well that because major art if

277
00:16:57,680 --> 00:16:59,060
it ends before I can't figure a search

278
00:16:59,060 --> 00:17:00,560
engine I want to see how the results are

279
00:17:00,560 --> 00:17:02,930
and it when I type something now that

280
00:17:02,930 --> 00:17:04,970
brings us to an interesting point of

281
00:17:04,970 --> 00:17:08,180
search but we're in now you can also

282
00:17:08,180 --> 00:17:10,550
contact the synonyms let us in on any

283
00:17:10,550 --> 00:17:12,829
file like we do it in the same classic

284
00:17:12,829 --> 00:17:15,740
search and create synonyms the search

285
00:17:15,740 --> 00:17:17,630
part that you want say if you have a

286
00:17:17,630 --> 00:17:20,569
specific mean that you want to try out

287
00:17:20,569 --> 00:17:23,930
and then let's say or say if you want to

288
00:17:23,930 --> 00:17:25,670
say eg I dropped amount and we just like

289
00:17:25,670 --> 00:17:28,310
very very weird but still I just try to

290
00:17:28,310 --> 00:17:30,260
say this in on it and see whenever I

291
00:17:30,260 --> 00:17:33,080
type for Rocky Mountain I should be

292
00:17:33,080 --> 00:17:36,200
getting the results that we have seen

293
00:17:36,200 --> 00:17:38,410
for English so I'll just simply say

294
00:17:38,410 --> 00:17:43,600
mountain so I still be able to like see

295
00:17:43,600 --> 00:17:47,360
the same results at the same sort of

296
00:17:47,360 --> 00:17:48,620
like you know the movies that we have

297
00:17:48,620 --> 00:17:51,380
seen previously so it takes them a bit

298
00:17:51,380 --> 00:17:53,060
of time to pack the link all the way all

299
00:17:53,060 --> 00:17:56,150
the state but it does get all it takes

300
00:17:56,150 --> 00:17:58,640
so you could also see the details of the

301
00:17:58,640 --> 00:18:01,490
movie and a lot of these informational

302
00:18:01,490 --> 00:18:03,800
details so more important things here

303
00:18:03,800 --> 00:18:06,530
like the document schema and a lot of

304
00:18:06,530 --> 00:18:09,490
these informational details like say a

305
00:18:09,490 --> 00:18:12,080
specific field has a specific type say

306
00:18:12,080 --> 00:18:14,930
that it is it is on text and if you want

307
00:18:14,930 --> 00:18:16,460
to change it to an end but you could

308
00:18:16,460 --> 00:18:18,170
simply click on change the type and

309
00:18:18,170 --> 00:18:19,940
click on the update part and like it

310
00:18:19,940 --> 00:18:22,190
will automatically leave that 'mentally

311
00:18:22,190 --> 00:18:24,020
change the type of that particular thing

312
00:18:24,020 --> 00:18:28,280
later played upon or the feed so talking

313
00:18:28,280 --> 00:18:31,220
about search again let you also have a

314
00:18:31,220 --> 00:18:33,590
lot of other details that comes in and

315
00:18:33,590 --> 00:18:35,450
you're going to search on s watching and

316
00:18:35,450 --> 00:18:37,880
say more importantly relevance to me how

317
00:18:37,880 --> 00:18:40,250
relevant relevant

318
00:18:40,250 --> 00:18:42,430
to be when you're trying to search on a

319
00:18:42,430 --> 00:18:45,710
on a date hour but you want to give more

320
00:18:45,710 --> 00:18:47,480
priority or you want to give more

321
00:18:47,480 --> 00:18:49,610
importance to a specific sort of you say

322
00:18:49,610 --> 00:18:51,680
in this case the movie name say if I

323
00:18:51,680 --> 00:18:54,410
want to search for original title in the

324
00:18:54,410 --> 00:18:57,920
title of the movie and I say that okay

325
00:18:57,920 --> 00:18:59,600
but of this feeling should be searchable

326
00:18:59,600 --> 00:19:01,520
not searchable because in some cases

327
00:19:01,520 --> 00:19:04,940
wherein you are building a HR system or

328
00:19:04,940 --> 00:19:07,400
you are building the system where just

329
00:19:07,400 --> 00:19:09,500
contain PII data and you don't want

330
00:19:09,500 --> 00:19:12,170
users or the planets to search on the

331
00:19:12,170 --> 00:19:14,090
data set you can disable the search from

332
00:19:14,090 --> 00:19:15,710
this field but the same point of time

333
00:19:15,710 --> 00:19:18,020
you will also be able to arrange the

334
00:19:18,020 --> 00:19:19,970
weight you will also be able to change

335
00:19:19,970 --> 00:19:22,550
the weight of this data for example let

336
00:19:22,550 --> 00:19:25,070
me go and look at the same thing by

337
00:19:25,070 --> 00:19:29,150
cropping and you see a bunch of search

338
00:19:29,150 --> 00:19:31,490
results right and and then like you

339
00:19:31,490 --> 00:19:33,320
could you could improve increase and

340
00:19:33,320 --> 00:19:35,480
decrease the waves of this particular

341
00:19:35,480 --> 00:19:38,780
title with respect to the entire realm

342
00:19:38,780 --> 00:19:40,640
when selecting optimize and change it

343
00:19:40,640 --> 00:19:42,680
accordingly you would also add things

344
00:19:42,680 --> 00:19:45,170
like moves to a specific value so but it

345
00:19:45,170 --> 00:19:47,000
gets bubbled up in your entire search

346
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:49,640
results now this is so this is a sort of

347
00:19:49,640 --> 00:19:52,100
like a relevance tuning that pit you can

348
00:19:52,100 --> 00:19:55,040
save and you can preserve it so that

349
00:19:55,040 --> 00:19:57,140
like you can retain it throughout the

350
00:19:57,140 --> 00:19:59,180
search and then through which you be

351
00:19:59,180 --> 00:20:01,880
able to like do more interesting or

352
00:20:01,880 --> 00:20:04,010
present present interesting data in the

353
00:20:04,010 --> 00:20:06,470
right format to the users so at the same

354
00:20:06,470 --> 00:20:09,080
time like I also like sorry I'm going

355
00:20:09,080 --> 00:20:11,300
really fast but I think like and show

356
00:20:11,300 --> 00:20:12,710
some more features and then like we can

357
00:20:12,710 --> 00:20:14,180
come to a conclusion and I could also

358
00:20:14,180 --> 00:20:17,180
take questions so at the same point like

359
00:20:17,180 --> 00:20:19,700
you also have a curation queries so

360
00:20:19,700 --> 00:20:21,320
these these are queries where if you

361
00:20:21,320 --> 00:20:24,110
want to say I am going ahead and sale

362
00:20:24,110 --> 00:20:26,750
same solanum that we have baby

363
00:20:26,750 --> 00:20:29,720
so suppose say if I have done specific

364
00:20:29,720 --> 00:20:32,300
sort of search results and I listen with

365
00:20:32,300 --> 00:20:34,610
a bunch of documents but I always want a

366
00:20:34,610 --> 00:20:37,820
specific document to be on top of my

367
00:20:37,820 --> 00:20:41,390
result set and not not the other way so

368
00:20:41,390 --> 00:20:43,280
on what I knew is that I'll just pull

369
00:20:43,280 --> 00:20:45,650
one of the document to the promoted

370
00:20:45,650 --> 00:20:47,540
document said and it creates a curation

371
00:20:47,540 --> 00:20:50,870
form and then whenever I search for this

372
00:20:50,870 --> 00:20:53,520
specific word this particular

373
00:20:53,520 --> 00:20:55,950
this particular document comes on so you

374
00:20:55,950 --> 00:20:59,280
could also say say something like so if

375
00:20:59,280 --> 00:21:00,870
you have a specific sort of restaurant

376
00:21:00,870 --> 00:21:02,760
or a dish that you want to show whenever

377
00:21:02,760 --> 00:21:05,250
you somebody says a sandwich and then

378
00:21:05,250 --> 00:21:06,929
you want to present a specification of

379
00:21:06,929 --> 00:21:09,870
somebody says a specific car you know

380
00:21:09,870 --> 00:21:12,770
restaurant name or a specific type of

381
00:21:12,770 --> 00:21:15,900
restaurant johner that they want to pull

382
00:21:15,900 --> 00:21:17,280
it and you want to present with the

383
00:21:17,280 --> 00:21:18,750
specific option say promote it or

384
00:21:18,750 --> 00:21:19,559
something like that

385
00:21:19,559 --> 00:21:22,080
and then you could do that easy so you

386
00:21:22,080 --> 00:21:23,580
could also do more this visit at the

387
00:21:23,580 --> 00:21:24,960
same time if you don't want to show

388
00:21:24,960 --> 00:21:27,090
specific results to the users are

389
00:21:27,090 --> 00:21:30,780
treated use the specific organic results

390
00:21:30,780 --> 00:21:32,190
that are coming in you could also do

391
00:21:32,190 --> 00:21:34,410
more the descent and I make sure that

392
00:21:34,410 --> 00:21:36,120
the document doesn't show in your search

393
00:21:36,120 --> 00:21:37,770
result even though organically it is

394
00:21:37,770 --> 00:21:39,780
coming into the first result so these

395
00:21:39,780 --> 00:21:41,929
are the various things at the same time

396
00:21:41,929 --> 00:21:44,630
like you also have result settings

397
00:21:44,630 --> 00:21:49,320
say to improve the twenty performance

398
00:21:49,320 --> 00:21:50,700
like what are the biggest things that

399
00:21:50,700 --> 00:21:52,770
you could show what is the size that you

400
00:21:52,770 --> 00:21:55,169
could show how can you display and a lot

401
00:21:55,169 --> 00:21:56,730
of these play or valuable though and you

402
00:21:56,730 --> 00:21:59,340
like you're getting or might win so you

403
00:21:59,340 --> 00:22:01,440
could tune that and do all of this so

404
00:22:01,440 --> 00:22:03,510
time and experience again comes to the

405
00:22:03,510 --> 00:22:06,000
credential so that means like you can

406
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:09,059
you get an option to do the API key like

407
00:22:09,059 --> 00:22:10,799
people take us Tony today is happening

408
00:22:10,799 --> 00:22:12,660
better search key and you could also get

409
00:22:12,660 --> 00:22:14,400
a private key to do all the operations

410
00:22:14,400 --> 00:22:16,650
the credential related operations will

411
00:22:16,650 --> 00:22:19,919
be destroyed and delete amenities for

412
00:22:19,919 --> 00:22:22,410
and update it is updated documents and a

413
00:22:22,410 --> 00:22:25,110
lot of these details so quickly going to

414
00:22:25,110 --> 00:22:27,330
the last part so not just the we believe

415
00:22:27,330 --> 00:22:29,549
not just like creating this entire

416
00:22:29,549 --> 00:22:32,130
experience but also we also thinking

417
00:22:32,130 --> 00:22:33,570
like that about the end user so whenever

418
00:22:33,570 --> 00:22:34,980
you try to build a search and there you

419
00:22:34,980 --> 00:22:36,210
are looking at a search box you're not

420
00:22:36,210 --> 00:22:39,059
looking at a server or endpoint that is

421
00:22:39,059 --> 00:22:40,530
there somewhere you still need to put

422
00:22:40,530 --> 00:22:43,110
and user experience so suppose if you

423
00:22:43,110 --> 00:22:46,320
see we have another open source project

424
00:22:46,320 --> 00:22:48,120
called search UI again you can explore

425
00:22:48,120 --> 00:22:51,210
the source code here but what this

426
00:22:51,210 --> 00:22:53,970
exactly is gives your reference here so

427
00:22:53,970 --> 00:22:56,340
suppose if you see there is a disappear

428
00:22:56,340 --> 00:22:59,910
then in the search bar sort by filter by

429
00:22:59,910 --> 00:23:01,980
and we saw the beacon so I will just

430
00:23:01,980 --> 00:23:03,990
sell it what are the fields that I want

431
00:23:03,990 --> 00:23:05,440
to see here and there

432
00:23:05,440 --> 00:23:07,600
and I will be able to do a lot of

433
00:23:07,600 --> 00:23:09,399
interesting today so let let me go and

434
00:23:09,399 --> 00:23:13,419
look at original title say filters are

435
00:23:13,419 --> 00:23:18,789
chosen us and then say IMDb rateing

436
00:23:18,789 --> 00:23:23,289
right and then short fields are say they

437
00:23:23,289 --> 00:23:26,620
mean not means combinations and then URL

438
00:23:26,620 --> 00:23:29,559
field is the postal path that I want to

439
00:23:29,559 --> 00:23:31,179
look at this week the data is from

440
00:23:31,179 --> 00:23:32,799
Wikipedia so I will be redirected to a

441
00:23:32,799 --> 00:23:34,419
posture so when if you can generate it

442
00:23:34,419 --> 00:23:38,440
review it generates a ad from the I mean

443
00:23:38,440 --> 00:23:41,139
a react react act so basically which you

444
00:23:41,139 --> 00:23:43,240
get download and get started this is

445
00:23:43,240 --> 00:23:45,580
from again being reactive I take you

446
00:23:45,580 --> 00:23:48,490
react UI app so which is the open source

447
00:23:48,490 --> 00:23:50,980
app to get started oh it's a kind of a

448
00:23:50,980 --> 00:23:53,200
hollow void but changed to adapt or the

449
00:23:53,200 --> 00:23:55,840
difference UI part so this n time in

450
00:23:55,840 --> 00:23:57,759
that search bar with all this experience

451
00:23:57,759 --> 00:23:59,860
it has come in and you just need to

452
00:23:59,860 --> 00:24:02,019
apply your own CSS or your own branding

453
00:24:02,019 --> 00:24:05,649
that you want so if I might say the same

454
00:24:05,649 --> 00:24:09,879
document and search for the results and

455
00:24:09,879 --> 00:24:13,779
it changes things even a click say fact

456
00:24:13,779 --> 00:24:17,679
if I have so if i have kicked this

457
00:24:17,679 --> 00:24:19,179
particular posture if you take me to the

458
00:24:19,179 --> 00:24:21,639
place that i want so you so you could

459
00:24:21,639 --> 00:24:23,169
also choose the results you could do

460
00:24:23,169 --> 00:24:24,940
everything that you want to do more

461
00:24:24,940 --> 00:24:27,700
importantly so so this is a this is the

462
00:24:27,700 --> 00:24:30,039
configuration and you can download this

463
00:24:30,039 --> 00:24:32,190
as ease and start building your own

464
00:24:32,190 --> 00:24:35,620
interesting thing not just this when you

465
00:24:35,620 --> 00:24:37,899
search all of this and you want to

466
00:24:37,899 --> 00:24:39,370
create a complete experience you will

467
00:24:39,370 --> 00:24:41,620
also go back to the analytics and see

468
00:24:41,620 --> 00:24:44,440
how everybody is fair and like ammonia

469
00:24:44,440 --> 00:24:46,509
mount of queries and then what are the

470
00:24:46,509 --> 00:24:48,129
very top queries that you have and

471
00:24:48,129 --> 00:24:51,009
queries with no results let's say

472
00:24:51,009 --> 00:24:52,779
sometimes when somebody has search for a

473
00:24:52,779 --> 00:24:55,990
specific product or a specific say a

474
00:24:55,990 --> 00:24:58,480
term that you then it has a different

475
00:24:58,480 --> 00:25:01,269
linguistic meaning or the pronunciation

476
00:25:01,269 --> 00:25:03,190
is quite different and you don't have

477
00:25:03,190 --> 00:25:05,320
data input quantity written on em but if

478
00:25:05,320 --> 00:25:07,690
you know so at the same time like the

479
00:25:07,690 --> 00:25:10,330
top queries with no lessons like gonna

480
00:25:10,330 --> 00:25:12,340
give that and then it would show the

481
00:25:12,340 --> 00:25:14,500
related information so so you would also

482
00:25:14,500 --> 00:25:16,659
see where people have think through the

483
00:25:16,659 --> 00:25:18,970
nimpah let's say how

484
00:25:18,970 --> 00:25:20,950
I have that document and I clicked on

485
00:25:20,950 --> 00:25:23,919
the link and went into it and looked at

486
00:25:23,919 --> 00:25:25,840
the product details view of the part so

487
00:25:25,840 --> 00:25:27,250
likewise there are many many things that

488
00:25:27,250 --> 00:25:28,539
you could do you could also collect the

489
00:25:28,539 --> 00:25:31,870
API log of this entire thing and analyze

490
00:25:31,870 --> 00:25:33,490
it in a different platform all together

491
00:25:33,490 --> 00:25:35,860
if you want so this is the overall view

492
00:25:35,860 --> 00:25:38,530
of how do you build a search how do you

493
00:25:38,530 --> 00:25:40,539
build an important search we can talk

494
00:25:40,539 --> 00:25:43,630
about anything about elasticsearch the

495
00:25:43,630 --> 00:25:45,429
operational things like how do you put

496
00:25:45,429 --> 00:25:48,159
up what what OS to use and many of these

497
00:25:48,159 --> 00:25:50,950
right so we just clicked on the easy

498
00:25:50,950 --> 00:25:53,049
part now at the same time I will quickly

499
00:25:53,049 --> 00:25:55,630
go back to the presentation and I'll

500
00:25:55,630 --> 00:25:57,370
show you some more slides how it is

501
00:25:57,370 --> 00:25:58,419
quite different from the regular

502
00:25:58,419 --> 00:26:02,140
elasticsearch experience say when you

503
00:26:02,140 --> 00:26:03,429
are talking about architecture because

504
00:26:03,429 --> 00:26:05,890
absence your application directly off to

505
00:26:05,890 --> 00:26:07,870
the classic search first to do all the

506
00:26:07,870 --> 00:26:10,510
queries and give you results but if you

507
00:26:10,510 --> 00:26:13,299
are looking at the absurd server which

508
00:26:13,299 --> 00:26:15,429
interacts there are six of it which does

509
00:26:15,429 --> 00:26:17,740
all the management all the tickets case

510
00:26:17,740 --> 00:26:19,780
of every feature in elastic search but

511
00:26:19,780 --> 00:26:21,809
gives you a nice UI and I search console

512
00:26:21,809 --> 00:26:24,070
builds you a lot of these details and

513
00:26:24,070 --> 00:26:25,980
you would also speed see you know

514
00:26:25,980 --> 00:26:28,210
application we are also looking to build

515
00:26:28,210 --> 00:26:30,730
a crawler we also have a problem to

516
00:26:30,730 --> 00:26:32,110
which you would be able to crawl from an

517
00:26:32,110 --> 00:26:34,330
HTTP endpoint we are trying to bring

518
00:26:34,330 --> 00:26:36,520
that into a search so that all the data

519
00:26:36,520 --> 00:26:38,740
that you want rather than calling in EPA

520
00:26:38,740 --> 00:26:41,409
I can just again say that column will

521
00:26:41,409 --> 00:26:43,179
automatically pull data from what sort

522
00:26:43,179 --> 00:26:44,350
of the table source and let try to

523
00:26:44,350 --> 00:26:48,250
optimize it for the user so so we time I

524
00:26:48,250 --> 00:26:50,679
would like to showcase some length the

525
00:26:50,679 --> 00:26:52,690
URL so if you want to join us let people

526
00:26:52,690 --> 00:26:54,880
go and join the elastic stacks community

527
00:26:54,880 --> 00:26:57,610
but you also have search URL like where

528
00:26:57,610 --> 00:26:59,650
you get all the resources downloadable

529
00:26:59,650 --> 00:27:02,500
stuff or presentation that we have that

530
00:27:02,500 --> 00:27:05,110
being said and thank you heavy are

531
00:27:05,110 --> 00:27:10,570
questions and have to take thank you

532
00:27:10,570 --> 00:27:13,929
very much we use elastic search in J

533
00:27:13,929 --> 00:27:15,730
hipster and I love it and I really liked

534
00:27:15,730 --> 00:27:17,470
the the part of the demo where you

535
00:27:17,470 --> 00:27:19,179
generate a react app that was pretty

536
00:27:19,179 --> 00:27:25,440
cool yeah so we don't have any questions

537
00:27:25,440 --> 00:27:29,799
on the Q&A or in slack so part of that's

538
00:27:29,799 --> 00:27:31,419
probably my fault with the audio in the

539
00:27:31,419 --> 00:27:32,500
beginning

540
00:27:32,500 --> 00:27:35,800
but I would ask you what's what's a new

541
00:27:35,800 --> 00:27:37,810
feature that's that's coming in elastic

542
00:27:37,810 --> 00:27:42,340
that you're excited about things are

543
00:27:42,340 --> 00:27:44,680
happening at this point so if you are

544
00:27:44,680 --> 00:27:47,860
thinking about building a we're thinking

545
00:27:47,860 --> 00:27:51,970
it will be a lot of ml in search like

546
00:27:51,970 --> 00:27:53,620
you also have something called vectors

547
00:27:53,620 --> 00:27:55,990
through which you will be able to do say

548
00:27:55,990 --> 00:27:59,710
something like email search like you'll

549
00:27:59,710 --> 00:28:03,550
be able to like kind of do in just a lot

550
00:28:03,550 --> 00:28:07,330
of binary data and kind of kind of like

551
00:28:07,330 --> 00:28:10,570
try to do a lot of other ML related

552
00:28:10,570 --> 00:28:12,010
stuff that's one interesting thing in

553
00:28:12,010 --> 00:28:14,200
the search part but then now there are

554
00:28:14,200 --> 00:28:16,330
many other stuff like optimizes

555
00:28:16,330 --> 00:28:18,910
optimizations in the you see through

556
00:28:18,910 --> 00:28:20,910
which should be able to like do more

557
00:28:20,910 --> 00:28:24,040
interesting stuff like optimize for

558
00:28:24,040 --> 00:28:25,630
thousands of users doing different

559
00:28:25,630 --> 00:28:27,130
different use cases in elastic search

560
00:28:27,130 --> 00:28:31,060
and to which if a bit of heat is being

561
00:28:31,060 --> 00:28:33,970
reduced then it's a lot of any benefit

562
00:28:33,970 --> 00:28:35,410
to a lot of users who are doing

563
00:28:35,410 --> 00:28:39,160
analytics search thousand other things

564
00:28:39,160 --> 00:28:43,600
so yeah nice alright thanks for joining

565
00:28:43,600 --> 00:28:45,580

566
00:28:45,580 --> 00:28:46,360
wonderful day
