1
00:00:09,519 --> 00:00:10,880
hello everybody

2
00:00:10,880 --> 00:00:13,440
i'm melissa miller and i am an

3
00:00:13,440 --> 00:00:15,440
application security advocate here at

4
00:00:15,440 --> 00:00:16,320
sneak

5
00:00:16,320 --> 00:00:18,880
and we are all set for our next speaker

6
00:00:18,880 --> 00:00:20,320
we're going to jump over now from

7
00:00:20,320 --> 00:00:21,760
javascript and we're going to

8
00:00:21,760 --> 00:00:25,199
hop into the security track

9
00:00:25,199 --> 00:00:27,439
and so our first speaker comes to us

10
00:00:27,439 --> 00:00:29,039
from auth0

11
00:00:29,039 --> 00:00:31,920
her name is anna sidre and she's here

12
00:00:31,920 --> 00:00:33,760
today she's going to tell us all about

13
00:00:33,760 --> 00:00:36,399
web components and how we can leverage

14
00:00:36,399 --> 00:00:38,160
them for authentication in our

15
00:00:38,160 --> 00:00:39,360
applications

16
00:00:39,360 --> 00:00:41,120
so with that i'm going to turn it over

17
00:00:41,120 --> 00:00:45,839
to you anna

18
00:00:49,440 --> 00:00:52,000
welcome to my talk about web components

19
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:53,360
for authentication

20
00:00:53,360 --> 00:00:56,079
the what the why and the how just before

21
00:00:56,079 --> 00:00:57,600
i dive into my talk

22
00:00:57,600 --> 00:01:00,879
let me introduce myself a little bit so

23
00:01:00,879 --> 00:01:03,039
i'm anna sidri and i'm a developer

24
00:01:03,039 --> 00:01:05,199
advocate for all sierra

25
00:01:05,199 --> 00:01:07,439
or xero is a flexible drop-in solution

26
00:01:07,439 --> 00:01:08,880
to add authentication

27
00:01:08,880 --> 00:01:10,880
and authorization services to your

28
00:01:10,880 --> 00:01:12,080
applications

29
00:01:12,080 --> 00:01:13,920
so if you have any questions about all

30
00:01:13,920 --> 00:01:16,159
xero about implementation

31
00:01:16,159 --> 00:01:18,479
about this talk or just want to say hi

32
00:01:18,479 --> 00:01:19,920
feel free to reach out

33
00:01:19,920 --> 00:01:22,600
on twitter my twitter handle is at

34
00:01:22,600 --> 00:01:25,600
anesthesia

35
00:01:25,680 --> 00:01:28,960
outside of work i'm pretty um active

36
00:01:28,960 --> 00:01:30,560
with community

37
00:01:30,560 --> 00:01:33,920
so i organized several events

38
00:01:33,920 --> 00:01:36,640
and meetups one of those is ng spain

39
00:01:36,640 --> 00:01:38,640
it's an angular conference

40
00:01:38,640 --> 00:01:41,200
in spain but because of the current

41
00:01:41,200 --> 00:01:43,040
situation this year we don't have a

42
00:01:43,040 --> 00:01:44,399
conference

43
00:01:44,399 --> 00:01:45,759
but hopefully next year we'll be able to

44
00:01:45,759 --> 00:01:47,920
run with them again

45
00:01:47,920 --> 00:01:49,600
and i'm very passionate about women in

46
00:01:49,600 --> 00:01:51,680
tech therefore i help a lot

47
00:01:51,680 --> 00:01:54,640
in this sector and i organize events

48
00:01:54,640 --> 00:01:56,159
locally with my

49
00:01:56,159 --> 00:01:59,280
gauss tech group and also on a more

50
00:01:59,280 --> 00:02:01,360
international scale with the google

51
00:02:01,360 --> 00:02:05,119
admission initiative women techmakers

52
00:02:05,119 --> 00:02:06,880
so that's enough about me let's get

53
00:02:06,880 --> 00:02:09,038
started and like i said

54
00:02:09,038 --> 00:02:11,680
um this talk is about web components for

55
00:02:11,680 --> 00:02:12,879
authentication

56
00:02:12,879 --> 00:02:15,360
so i think a good starting point is to

57
00:02:15,360 --> 00:02:16,480
ask ourselves

58
00:02:16,480 --> 00:02:19,599
what is a web component so a web

59
00:02:19,599 --> 00:02:20,400
component

60
00:02:20,400 --> 00:02:22,239
is a component that is completely

61
00:02:22,239 --> 00:02:23,840
platform agnostic

62
00:02:23,840 --> 00:02:25,480
this allows us to have maximum

63
00:02:25,480 --> 00:02:26,879
interoperability because

64
00:02:26,879 --> 00:02:28,640
we have to share it across themes and we

65
00:02:28,640 --> 00:02:31,599
can use it as many times as we need to

66
00:02:31,599 --> 00:02:32,720
another cool thing about world

67
00:02:32,720 --> 00:02:35,040
components is that they allow us to

68
00:02:35,040 --> 00:02:38,400
be encapsulated right so this

69
00:02:38,400 --> 00:02:40,480
prevents any styling or behavioral

70
00:02:40,480 --> 00:02:43,200
leakages in or out

71
00:02:43,200 --> 00:02:45,040
when we think about web components we

72
00:02:45,040 --> 00:02:47,599
tend to think about dumb components

73
00:02:47,599 --> 00:02:49,760
but that is totally not true and we're

74
00:02:49,760 --> 00:02:51,440
going to see later on in this talk but

75
00:02:51,440 --> 00:02:53,599
we can also create smart components with

76
00:02:53,599 --> 00:02:54,720
them

77
00:02:54,720 --> 00:02:57,200
so what do these web components actually

78
00:02:57,200 --> 00:02:58,480
consist of

79
00:02:58,480 --> 00:03:00,080
well they consist of three main

80
00:03:00,080 --> 00:03:02,560
technologies html template

81
00:03:02,560 --> 00:03:05,599
custom elements and shadow dom html

82
00:03:05,599 --> 00:03:07,920
template is just the html tag called

83
00:03:07,920 --> 00:03:08,560
template

84
00:03:08,560 --> 00:03:10,879
in which we place the template of our

85
00:03:10,879 --> 00:03:12,480
web component

86
00:03:12,480 --> 00:03:14,560
and then with custom elements what we do

87
00:03:14,560 --> 00:03:16,640
is actually create the html

88
00:03:16,640 --> 00:03:19,519
tag or we can extend or improve an

89
00:03:19,519 --> 00:03:22,000
already existing one

90
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:24,159
but we do have to be careful when we're

91
00:03:24,159 --> 00:03:27,040
creating html tag with the naming

92
00:03:27,040 --> 00:03:30,799
like best practices in all languages we

93
00:03:30,799 --> 00:03:31,599
should

94
00:03:31,599 --> 00:03:34,239
probably keep the naming understandable

95
00:03:34,239 --> 00:03:35,360
so we know what we're

96
00:03:35,360 --> 00:03:37,440
dealing with and also when we're writing

97
00:03:37,440 --> 00:03:39,599
our code we would want to know

98
00:03:39,599 --> 00:03:41,519
um for our future cells and for other

99
00:03:41,519 --> 00:03:44,239
people what this component actually does

100
00:03:44,239 --> 00:03:45,760
right

101
00:03:45,760 --> 00:03:47,200
also when you're naming you have to

102
00:03:47,200 --> 00:03:49,519
remember to add a dash so it has to be

103
00:03:49,519 --> 00:03:52,959
web dash component for example

104
00:03:52,959 --> 00:03:55,439
and last but not least shadow dom so

105
00:03:55,439 --> 00:03:57,040
shadow dom is what's going to allow us

106
00:03:57,040 --> 00:03:58,480
to have that encapsulation that i was

107
00:03:58,480 --> 00:03:59,360
talking about

108
00:03:59,360 --> 00:04:02,799
earlier okay so to get a better

109
00:04:02,799 --> 00:04:04,480
understanding of what our component

110
00:04:04,480 --> 00:04:06,959
is we will start by building a dumb

111
00:04:06,959 --> 00:04:08,560
component

112
00:04:08,560 --> 00:04:10,080
and what we're going to build is a

113
00:04:10,080 --> 00:04:12,319
simple login button which we can style

114
00:04:12,319 --> 00:04:13,760
from the outside

115
00:04:13,760 --> 00:04:16,720
so let's dive right in first of all what

116
00:04:16,720 --> 00:04:18,320
we're doing is we're creating our

117
00:04:18,320 --> 00:04:20,478
template tag here

118
00:04:20,478 --> 00:04:23,919
and we have a simple button with an id

119
00:04:23,919 --> 00:04:27,600
login button which will relate to staff

120
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:29,840
then we are creating our custom element

121
00:04:29,840 --> 00:04:31,919
and we are extending html element

122
00:04:31,919 --> 00:04:32,720
because it

123
00:04:32,720 --> 00:04:34,720
allows us to inherit all of the features

124
00:04:34,720 --> 00:04:36,800
of this html element obviously

125
00:04:36,800 --> 00:04:39,919
and also it will be recognized as a dom

126
00:04:39,919 --> 00:04:42,080
element then we're calling our

127
00:04:42,080 --> 00:04:44,160
constructor and in there we have super

128
00:04:44,160 --> 00:04:48,400
so we have access to all of the apis

129
00:04:48,479 --> 00:04:50,240
next what we need to do is add our

130
00:04:50,240 --> 00:04:51,520
shared domain here

131
00:04:51,520 --> 00:04:54,080
and this is a very simple process all we

132
00:04:54,080 --> 00:04:56,080
need to do is add two lines of codes

133
00:04:56,080 --> 00:04:58,720
so we're attaching the shadow and we're

134
00:04:58,720 --> 00:04:59,199
calling

135
00:04:59,199 --> 00:05:02,479
mode open we call mode open

136
00:05:02,479 --> 00:05:05,199
because we want to um give the

137
00:05:05,199 --> 00:05:06,240
possibility

138
00:05:06,240 --> 00:05:08,880
to the users to manipulate the structure

139
00:05:08,880 --> 00:05:11,120
of the component via javascript

140
00:05:11,120 --> 00:05:12,800
now if you didn't want to do this you

141
00:05:12,800 --> 00:05:14,800
could put closed here

142
00:05:14,800 --> 00:05:17,740
where where my cursor is and um

143
00:05:17,740 --> 00:05:19,120
[Music]

144
00:05:19,120 --> 00:05:21,360
this in general i wouldn't recommend

145
00:05:21,360 --> 00:05:23,199
closing it because

146
00:05:23,199 --> 00:05:25,039
even though you have intentions for your

147
00:05:25,039 --> 00:05:27,520
web component to be a certain way

148
00:05:27,520 --> 00:05:29,039
developers might want to use them in

149
00:05:29,039 --> 00:05:30,400
different ways and have different

150
00:05:30,400 --> 00:05:31,440
structures

151
00:05:31,440 --> 00:05:33,759
so in general i would advise to keep it

152
00:05:33,759 --> 00:05:35,199
open

153
00:05:35,199 --> 00:05:37,440
and then what we're doing is we're just

154
00:05:37,440 --> 00:05:39,360
cleaning our template and instead of

155
00:05:39,360 --> 00:05:41,039
adding it to the dom we're adding it to

156
00:05:41,039 --> 00:05:43,199
the shadow dom

157
00:05:43,199 --> 00:05:45,919
cool and last but not least we need to

158
00:05:45,919 --> 00:05:47,759
define our custom element

159
00:05:47,759 --> 00:05:49,280
i remember how i said that we should

160
00:05:49,280 --> 00:05:51,440
give it a name that's legible

161
00:05:51,440 --> 00:05:53,360
well in this case we're going to call it

162
00:05:53,360 --> 00:05:55,280
login button

163
00:05:55,280 --> 00:05:57,199
and then we just call the property login

164
00:05:57,199 --> 00:05:58,639
by saying element

165
00:05:58,639 --> 00:06:00,960
so we're basically done but right at the

166
00:06:00,960 --> 00:06:03,280
beginning when we created the template

167
00:06:03,280 --> 00:06:06,160
i didn't show you how we could style it

168
00:06:06,160 --> 00:06:06,880
now

169
00:06:06,880 --> 00:06:09,039
i wanted this pause here on the styling

170
00:06:09,039 --> 00:06:09,919
a bit because

171
00:06:09,919 --> 00:06:12,720
it's a very very important aspect when

172
00:06:12,720 --> 00:06:14,800
we create a web component people will be

173
00:06:14,800 --> 00:06:16,880
using it and implementing it into their

174
00:06:16,880 --> 00:06:18,479
own applications

175
00:06:18,479 --> 00:06:20,720
so we need to think about use cases as

176
00:06:20,720 --> 00:06:23,039
how they're going to be styling these

177
00:06:23,039 --> 00:06:25,360
they should have the possibility to

178
00:06:25,360 --> 00:06:26,960
style them accordingly

179
00:06:26,960 --> 00:06:28,560
to their application whether it's

180
00:06:28,560 --> 00:06:31,120
because of corporate identity design

181
00:06:31,120 --> 00:06:32,479
or whether it's just personal

182
00:06:32,479 --> 00:06:35,039
preferences i think styling is something

183
00:06:35,039 --> 00:06:35,840
that

184
00:06:35,840 --> 00:06:39,759
really needs to be thought about so

185
00:06:39,759 --> 00:06:42,400
there's two ways to go about styling the

186
00:06:42,400 --> 00:06:42,880
first

187
00:06:42,880 --> 00:06:46,000
is called css custom properties and this

188
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:47,840
is the preferred way just because the

189
00:06:47,840 --> 00:06:49,199
browsers

190
00:06:49,199 --> 00:06:52,400
are almost fully stable

191
00:06:52,400 --> 00:06:56,080
so what we do here is we to allow

192
00:06:56,080 --> 00:06:58,479
css custom properties we call css

193
00:06:58,479 --> 00:07:01,360
variables on rcss properties

194
00:07:01,360 --> 00:07:04,160
so you can see within our login button

195
00:07:04,160 --> 00:07:06,080
we have a background color

196
00:07:06,080 --> 00:07:07,680
and then on the background color

197
00:07:07,680 --> 00:07:09,680
property we're calling bar

198
00:07:09,680 --> 00:07:11,840
and then within the parenthesis we give

199
00:07:11,840 --> 00:07:13,039
it a variable name

200
00:07:13,039 --> 00:07:16,240
and a default color and then

201
00:07:16,240 --> 00:07:18,639
the user from the outside what they can

202
00:07:18,639 --> 00:07:21,199
do is then style the web component

203
00:07:21,199 --> 00:07:23,520
through the style attribute the html

204
00:07:23,520 --> 00:07:25,120
style attribute

205
00:07:25,120 --> 00:07:27,840
and they are calling the variable name

206
00:07:27,840 --> 00:07:29,759
and then the color of their choice

207
00:07:29,759 --> 00:07:31,360
that way they can change the background

208
00:07:31,360 --> 00:07:32,800
color to

209
00:07:32,800 --> 00:07:35,440
fit their application and this can go

210
00:07:35,440 --> 00:07:38,080
for as many variables as you want to

211
00:07:38,080 --> 00:07:40,880
but as you can imagine this can tend to

212
00:07:40,880 --> 00:07:42,240
be a bit buggy

213
00:07:42,240 --> 00:07:45,759
because you can always have a typo um

214
00:07:45,759 --> 00:07:48,879
also it's a bit tedious because you have

215
00:07:48,879 --> 00:07:50,479
to add so many different variables there

216
00:07:50,479 --> 00:07:52,560
and start attributes

217
00:07:52,560 --> 00:07:54,879
so there is another way to go about this

218
00:07:54,879 --> 00:07:57,039
and it's called css shadow paths with

219
00:07:57,039 --> 00:07:57,840
the part

220
00:07:57,840 --> 00:08:00,639
pseudo class um i'm going to briefly go

221
00:08:00,639 --> 00:08:02,319
over it but if you do want to have a

222
00:08:02,319 --> 00:08:03,680
better understanding of this

223
00:08:03,680 --> 00:08:05,840
i really recommend that you check out

224
00:08:05,840 --> 00:08:06,720
the article

225
00:08:06,720 --> 00:08:10,000
that you see there below that source um

226
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:12,560
because this is an article by monica

227
00:08:12,560 --> 00:08:14,240
from the polymer team and she explains

228
00:08:14,240 --> 00:08:17,360
it really and does them really well

229
00:08:17,360 --> 00:08:20,800
one problem with css shadow parts

230
00:08:20,800 --> 00:08:22,960
is that the browsers aren't stable i

231
00:08:22,960 --> 00:08:24,800
know supplier is working on it so that

232
00:08:24,800 --> 00:08:27,280
will hopefully turn green soon

233
00:08:27,280 --> 00:08:30,160
but you can see that um css custom

234
00:08:30,160 --> 00:08:33,679
properties are a lot more stable

235
00:08:33,679 --> 00:08:37,679
so the cool thing about the um

236
00:08:37,679 --> 00:08:40,559
css parts pseudo class is that we can

237
00:08:40,559 --> 00:08:41,839
allow

238
00:08:41,839 --> 00:08:44,959
developers to just we can decide what

239
00:08:44,959 --> 00:08:47,200
parts of our web component developers

240
00:08:47,200 --> 00:08:47,600
can

241
00:08:47,600 --> 00:08:50,000
style now i know in a button there

242
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:50,800
aren't very many

243
00:08:50,800 --> 00:08:53,920
different parts but say for example in a

244
00:08:53,920 --> 00:08:55,040
form

245
00:08:55,040 --> 00:08:57,360
or in a card you might have separate

246
00:08:57,360 --> 00:08:58,800
sections and you might want

247
00:08:58,800 --> 00:09:02,000
the users to just start for example

248
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:04,959
a div or an input however you don't want

249
00:09:04,959 --> 00:09:06,399
them to start a different dip for

250
00:09:06,399 --> 00:09:07,600
whatever reason

251
00:09:07,600 --> 00:09:09,360
now you can give them access through the

252
00:09:09,360 --> 00:09:12,240
part attribute and then give it a name

253
00:09:12,240 --> 00:09:15,200
and then the user when they decide that

254
00:09:15,200 --> 00:09:17,120
they want to style their component

255
00:09:17,120 --> 00:09:19,600
all they have to do is in their css add

256
00:09:19,600 --> 00:09:21,440
the web component name

257
00:09:21,440 --> 00:09:24,240
uses the part cedar class and then give

258
00:09:24,240 --> 00:09:25,600
it a name

259
00:09:25,600 --> 00:09:27,360
and then they can just change whatever

260
00:09:27,360 --> 00:09:28,800
properties they want to so

261
00:09:28,800 --> 00:09:31,360
it's a lot nicer a lot neater it's a lot

262
00:09:31,360 --> 00:09:32,560
more readable

263
00:09:32,560 --> 00:09:37,040
and it's also a lot easier so

264
00:09:37,040 --> 00:09:38,800
how would we implement it into our

265
00:09:38,800 --> 00:09:40,240
button well we can

266
00:09:40,240 --> 00:09:42,480
and all we need to do is cause a part

267
00:09:42,480 --> 00:09:43,680
here

268
00:09:43,680 --> 00:09:46,720
and then the user would

269
00:09:46,720 --> 00:09:48,720
call the web component which is the

270
00:09:48,720 --> 00:09:51,120
login button the password class

271
00:09:51,120 --> 00:09:53,200
and then the name of the part which is

272
00:09:53,200 --> 00:09:55,040
custom button

273
00:09:55,040 --> 00:09:57,440
right and that's how we allow how that's

274
00:09:57,440 --> 00:09:58,720
how we create

275
00:09:58,720 --> 00:10:02,079
a login button and we create

276
00:10:02,079 --> 00:10:05,360
that star attribute from which people

277
00:10:05,360 --> 00:10:06,399
can

278
00:10:06,399 --> 00:10:09,440
style however they want to

279
00:10:09,440 --> 00:10:10,959
so now that we have a basic

280
00:10:10,959 --> 00:10:13,120
understanding of what web components

281
00:10:13,120 --> 00:10:16,320
are let's move on to authentication

282
00:10:16,320 --> 00:10:19,279
so what is authentication authentication

283
00:10:19,279 --> 00:10:21,839
is the process of confirming identity

284
00:10:21,839 --> 00:10:24,399
it's when a user or an application or an

285
00:10:24,399 --> 00:10:25,440
application

286
00:10:25,440 --> 00:10:27,519
proves that they say who they say they

287
00:10:27,519 --> 00:10:28,800
are by

288
00:10:28,800 --> 00:10:31,519
providing valid credentials which tend

289
00:10:31,519 --> 00:10:32,800
to be a username

290
00:10:32,800 --> 00:10:35,839
or a password however there are many

291
00:10:35,839 --> 00:10:37,360
factors we can use

292
00:10:37,360 --> 00:10:40,640
to validate these credentials and if you

293
00:10:40,640 --> 00:10:41,040
have

294
00:10:41,040 --> 00:10:44,560
more than one um process

295
00:10:44,560 --> 00:10:47,120
one factor authentication say you have

296
00:10:47,120 --> 00:10:48,399
two-factor authentication

297
00:10:48,399 --> 00:10:50,480
what multi-factor authentication this is

298
00:10:50,480 --> 00:10:51,839
going to make your application

299
00:10:51,839 --> 00:10:54,880
more secure and these factors

300
00:10:54,880 --> 00:10:57,519
tend to rely on they fall into like

301
00:10:57,519 --> 00:11:00,160
three categories which are what you know

302
00:11:00,160 --> 00:11:04,079
what you have or what you are

303
00:11:04,079 --> 00:11:07,760
now um authentication and authorization

304
00:11:07,760 --> 00:11:10,720
tend to be used interchangeably however

305
00:11:10,720 --> 00:11:11,839
they are very different

306
00:11:11,839 --> 00:11:14,720
so whereas authentication is the process

307
00:11:14,720 --> 00:11:15,760
of

308
00:11:15,760 --> 00:11:19,079
validating a user well

309
00:11:19,079 --> 00:11:21,040
authorization is the process of

310
00:11:21,040 --> 00:11:24,720
verifying what a user has access to

311
00:11:24,720 --> 00:11:27,600
so in authentication in authorization

312
00:11:27,600 --> 00:11:28,640
sorry

313
00:11:28,640 --> 00:11:31,200
a user or an application is granted

314
00:11:31,200 --> 00:11:32,800
access to an api

315
00:11:32,800 --> 00:11:36,800
and after the api determines what extent

316
00:11:36,800 --> 00:11:39,519
like what permissions it should assign

317
00:11:39,519 --> 00:11:41,200
to that user

318
00:11:41,200 --> 00:11:43,360
so this is the part that comes after

319
00:11:43,360 --> 00:11:45,120
authentication

320
00:11:45,120 --> 00:11:48,000
and um yes it's true that access to a

321
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:49,760
resource is protected by both

322
00:11:49,760 --> 00:11:50,720
authentication

323
00:11:50,720 --> 00:11:53,839
and authorization however for

324
00:11:53,839 --> 00:11:56,160
this talk we are just going to focus on

325
00:11:56,160 --> 00:11:58,560
authentication

326
00:11:58,560 --> 00:12:00,240
so now we've got a basic understanding

327
00:12:00,240 --> 00:12:01,760
of what a web component is what

328
00:12:01,760 --> 00:12:03,519
authentication is

329
00:12:03,519 --> 00:12:05,760
how can a web component-based ecosystem

330
00:12:05,760 --> 00:12:08,959
help when approaching

331
00:12:09,279 --> 00:12:10,160
well i'm authentication to talk to you

332
00:12:10,160 --> 00:12:12,800
about several things that i think

333
00:12:12,800 --> 00:12:14,720
that where i think her web components

334
00:12:14,720 --> 00:12:15,839
can help

335
00:12:15,839 --> 00:12:17,279
and we will start with maximum

336
00:12:17,279 --> 00:12:18,880
interoperability which is something that

337
00:12:18,880 --> 00:12:19,680
i talked about

338
00:12:19,680 --> 00:12:22,639
at the very beginning of the talk now

339
00:12:22,639 --> 00:12:24,000
let's put a use case say like

340
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:26,800
for example there is a big company and

341
00:12:26,800 --> 00:12:28,560
there are several products within the

342
00:12:28,560 --> 00:12:29,440
company

343
00:12:29,440 --> 00:12:32,079
and each product has their own team and

344
00:12:32,079 --> 00:12:34,000
each team uses a different framework

345
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:36,079
maybe one team uses the angular another

346
00:12:36,079 --> 00:12:37,360
team that uses view

347
00:12:37,360 --> 00:12:38,880
and last but not least we have a team

348
00:12:38,880 --> 00:12:42,000
that uses polymer

349
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:45,440
now they all need this login process

350
00:12:45,440 --> 00:12:48,160
and it has to have the same feel even

351
00:12:48,160 --> 00:12:49,279
though the design

352
00:12:49,279 --> 00:12:51,839
isn't necessarily the same because

353
00:12:51,839 --> 00:12:53,040
different products can have different

354
00:12:53,040 --> 00:12:54,639
designs

355
00:12:54,639 --> 00:12:57,040
the user experience should more or less

356
00:12:57,040 --> 00:12:58,720
be the same because it is the same

357
00:12:58,720 --> 00:13:00,079
company

358
00:13:00,079 --> 00:13:03,120
so how could we go about this well

359
00:13:03,120 --> 00:13:06,160
instead of having each team to build the

360
00:13:06,160 --> 00:13:08,079
same login process

361
00:13:08,079 --> 00:13:10,639
like three times in this case we could

362
00:13:10,639 --> 00:13:12,720
create one web component

363
00:13:12,720 --> 00:13:15,040
and then share it across teams or

364
00:13:15,040 --> 00:13:15,920
however many

365
00:13:15,920 --> 00:13:17,440
web components we may need for this

366
00:13:17,440 --> 00:13:19,680
login process but then share it across

367
00:13:19,680 --> 00:13:21,120
teams and we're not starting from

368
00:13:21,120 --> 00:13:21,600
scratch

369
00:13:21,600 --> 00:13:24,639
every single time so this will save a

370
00:13:24,639 --> 00:13:25,519
lot of time

371
00:13:25,519 --> 00:13:28,560
and a lot of headaches now if you want

372
00:13:28,560 --> 00:13:28,959
to know

373
00:13:28,959 --> 00:13:31,440
if your framework the framework you're

374
00:13:31,440 --> 00:13:32,880
working with

375
00:13:32,880 --> 00:13:35,279
allows you to use web components well um

376
00:13:35,279 --> 00:13:36,959
i would go check out this

377
00:13:36,959 --> 00:13:38,639
website custom elements everywhere by

378
00:13:38,639 --> 00:13:40,639
rob dodson who's on the part of the team

379
00:13:40,639 --> 00:13:42,959
he created this to show you how web

380
00:13:42,959 --> 00:13:44,079
component friendly

381
00:13:44,079 --> 00:13:47,839
frameworks are next web components are

382
00:13:47,839 --> 00:13:50,240
very very easy to implement

383
00:13:50,240 --> 00:13:52,399
now normally when we have to do some

384
00:13:52,399 --> 00:13:54,480
sort of implementation it comes with a

385
00:13:54,480 --> 00:13:55,600
very long and

386
00:13:55,600 --> 00:13:58,800
tedious way of doing so we have to copy

387
00:13:58,800 --> 00:14:00,079
code we have to paste so we have to

388
00:14:00,079 --> 00:14:01,600
change we have to do this we have to do

389
00:14:01,600 --> 00:14:02,480
that

390
00:14:02,480 --> 00:14:05,920
and sometimes things don't go as planned

391
00:14:05,920 --> 00:14:06,160
and

392
00:14:06,160 --> 00:14:07,920
we have to look for another way of doing

393
00:14:07,920 --> 00:14:09,600
it and it can cause a lot of time and

394
00:14:09,600 --> 00:14:10,160
headaches

395
00:14:10,160 --> 00:14:13,279
like i said before so

396
00:14:13,279 --> 00:14:15,519
with web components all we need to do is

397
00:14:15,519 --> 00:14:17,440
use the code that's on the right

398
00:14:17,440 --> 00:14:20,639
the login button for example

399
00:14:20,639 --> 00:14:23,360
and then we do an mp install we have to

400
00:14:23,360 --> 00:14:24,880
also add the attribute attributes

401
00:14:24,880 --> 00:14:25,920
obviously

402
00:14:25,920 --> 00:14:28,399
and then you save it and that's it

403
00:14:28,399 --> 00:14:29,519
you're good to go

404
00:14:29,519 --> 00:14:34,160
so it's a pretty pretty simple process

405
00:14:34,160 --> 00:14:36,639
another cool thing is that we can have

406
00:14:36,639 --> 00:14:38,320
as much flexibility

407
00:14:38,320 --> 00:14:40,000
as we want whether it's through the head

408
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:41,920
through the html attributes

409
00:14:41,920 --> 00:14:44,880
oh sorry a little bit faster um here we

410
00:14:44,880 --> 00:14:46,480
have the domain and the client id

411
00:14:46,480 --> 00:14:48,560
attributes however you can add or remove

412
00:14:48,560 --> 00:14:50,000
whichever ones you want

413
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:52,160
and gives the user as much flexibility

414
00:14:52,160 --> 00:14:53,440
as you want to

415
00:14:53,440 --> 00:14:56,000
so that's pretty cool and talking about

416
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:57,600
flexibility we've already talked about

417
00:14:57,600 --> 00:14:58,800
styling

418
00:14:58,800 --> 00:15:00,000
i'm just going to mention the two

419
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:02,160
stylings that we have but again

420
00:15:02,160 --> 00:15:05,680
the user can design and change the web

421
00:15:05,680 --> 00:15:07,199
component however they

422
00:15:07,199 --> 00:15:09,600
want to because there's css custom

423
00:15:09,600 --> 00:15:12,880
properties and here's the shadow part

424
00:15:12,880 --> 00:15:15,920
and last but not least we have slots

425
00:15:15,920 --> 00:15:18,959
so slots act like a placeholder in which

426
00:15:18,959 --> 00:15:20,800
the user can then decide whether they

427
00:15:20,800 --> 00:15:23,519
want to actually add a piece of html

428
00:15:23,519 --> 00:15:26,560
within their web component or not let's

429
00:15:26,560 --> 00:15:28,079
see what i'm talking about here

430
00:15:28,079 --> 00:15:31,199
so as you can see we have two buttons

431
00:15:31,199 --> 00:15:33,839
a login one a log out and then we have a

432
00:15:33,839 --> 00:15:34,639
slot

433
00:15:34,639 --> 00:15:37,360
which might be for example to allow the

434
00:15:37,360 --> 00:15:39,199
user to add a description if they want

435
00:15:39,199 --> 00:15:39,680
to

436
00:15:39,680 --> 00:15:42,880
or a name or a role or whatever they may

437
00:15:42,880 --> 00:15:45,199
want to hear

438
00:15:45,199 --> 00:15:46,959
when you're dealing with slots it's

439
00:15:46,959 --> 00:15:48,800
important and always good practice to

440
00:15:48,800 --> 00:15:50,800
add a name because if you have more than

441
00:15:50,800 --> 00:15:52,720
one slot then the dom needs to know

442
00:15:52,720 --> 00:15:53,360
watch

443
00:15:53,360 --> 00:15:55,519
which slot you're talking about and what

444
00:15:55,519 --> 00:15:57,440
where to add it basically

445
00:15:57,440 --> 00:15:59,199
so remember to always name your slots

446
00:15:59,199 --> 00:16:02,399
even if you just have the one

447
00:16:02,560 --> 00:16:05,440
and then the user would then through the

448
00:16:05,440 --> 00:16:07,839
auth element

449
00:16:07,839 --> 00:16:11,600
after adding the attributes whatever

450
00:16:11,600 --> 00:16:13,920
it can just add a div for example and

451
00:16:13,920 --> 00:16:15,120
then add the slot

452
00:16:15,120 --> 00:16:18,320
and um the name of the slot and then

453
00:16:18,320 --> 00:16:20,000
whatever

454
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:22,079
they need to there so that's a pretty

455
00:16:22,079 --> 00:16:24,638
cool feature

456
00:16:25,199 --> 00:16:28,240
next web components we could create to

457
00:16:28,240 --> 00:16:30,639
make authentication simple

458
00:16:30,639 --> 00:16:33,759
now here are a few ideas that i have

459
00:16:33,759 --> 00:16:36,399
to make this authentication process a

460
00:16:36,399 --> 00:16:37,360
bit more simple

461
00:16:37,360 --> 00:16:40,320
through just using web components one of

462
00:16:40,320 --> 00:16:40,639
them

463
00:16:40,639 --> 00:16:43,120
could be a login screen and we have

464
00:16:43,120 --> 00:16:45,759
social buttons here

465
00:16:45,759 --> 00:16:49,199
it's just an idea it could be

466
00:16:49,199 --> 00:16:52,320
maybe the name of the logged in user

467
00:16:52,320 --> 00:16:54,240
and then maybe when the name is clicked

468
00:16:54,240 --> 00:16:56,399
or the images clicks

469
00:16:56,399 --> 00:16:58,399
it takes the user to the profile or

470
00:16:58,399 --> 00:17:00,320
maybe we want to add the user's roles

471
00:17:00,320 --> 00:17:01,360
here

472
00:17:01,360 --> 00:17:02,959
or it really depends on what you're

473
00:17:02,959 --> 00:17:05,679
looking for

474
00:17:05,679 --> 00:17:08,079
and then this is what we're going to be

475
00:17:08,079 --> 00:17:09,760
building in just a second

476
00:17:09,760 --> 00:17:11,760
it's a web component that is a login

477
00:17:11,760 --> 00:17:13,839
button which we've already seen

478
00:17:13,839 --> 00:17:15,359
however it's going to deal with the

479
00:17:15,359 --> 00:17:17,439
whole authentication process

480
00:17:17,439 --> 00:17:21,599
and to do so we're going to use all zera

481
00:17:21,599 --> 00:17:23,919
now remember how i said at the beginning

482
00:17:23,919 --> 00:17:25,199
we were building a

483
00:17:25,199 --> 00:17:27,199
dumb component where we built this some

484
00:17:27,199 --> 00:17:29,919
component had no logic to it

485
00:17:29,919 --> 00:17:33,520
so let's make that dumb component smart

486
00:17:33,520 --> 00:17:35,840
now to make the the dumb component smart

487
00:17:35,840 --> 00:17:39,360
i have used an all serial sdk to help me

488
00:17:39,360 --> 00:17:42,799
so let's see what i did first of all

489
00:17:42,799 --> 00:17:45,919
i imp i installed the all zero sdk

490
00:17:45,919 --> 00:17:48,400
spar.js because for this example we will

491
00:17:48,400 --> 00:17:50,160
be using vanilla.js

492
00:17:50,160 --> 00:17:51,840
later on i'll show you other options we

493
00:17:51,840 --> 00:17:54,080
can use to build web components but just

494
00:17:54,080 --> 00:17:54,880
for

495
00:17:54,880 --> 00:17:57,280
simplicity of the talk i have built

496
00:17:57,280 --> 00:18:00,320
within airjs um

497
00:18:00,320 --> 00:18:02,400
then we're going to import it like you

498
00:18:02,400 --> 00:18:04,240
see here

499
00:18:04,240 --> 00:18:07,280
and then when we created our

500
00:18:07,280 --> 00:18:09,679
login button element previously we're

501
00:18:09,679 --> 00:18:11,600
going to add the domain and client id

502
00:18:11,600 --> 00:18:13,039
properties which are going to be the

503
00:18:13,039 --> 00:18:14,799
attributes that we are going to allow

504
00:18:14,799 --> 00:18:17,039
the user to add

505
00:18:17,039 --> 00:18:19,280
so here we keep them empty because this

506
00:18:19,280 --> 00:18:20,720
is what we want to allow the users to

507
00:18:20,720 --> 00:18:21,120
add

508
00:18:21,120 --> 00:18:23,600
the information we want to add and then

509
00:18:23,600 --> 00:18:26,080
we have some getters and setters

510
00:18:26,080 --> 00:18:29,600
so um we have these on both the

511
00:18:29,600 --> 00:18:32,880
domain and the client id and as you can

512
00:18:32,880 --> 00:18:33,520
see

513
00:18:33,520 --> 00:18:36,080
i have a build or xero client method

514
00:18:36,080 --> 00:18:37,679
there at the bottom

515
00:18:37,679 --> 00:18:40,559
and this is so that um because we need

516
00:18:40,559 --> 00:18:43,360
to rebuild the all zero client whenever

517
00:18:43,360 --> 00:18:44,320
the values

518
00:18:44,320 --> 00:18:46,559
of the domain or the client id

519
00:18:46,559 --> 00:18:48,160
properties change

520
00:18:48,160 --> 00:18:50,640
so we need to invoke this method and we

521
00:18:50,640 --> 00:18:53,440
need to do it last

522
00:18:53,440 --> 00:18:57,600
we then have the get observed attributes

523
00:18:57,600 --> 00:19:00,160
so the get observed attributes is a

524
00:19:00,160 --> 00:19:02,080
static property that returns an array as

525
00:19:02,080 --> 00:19:03,200
you can see

526
00:19:03,200 --> 00:19:05,120
and it has the names of the components

527
00:19:05,120 --> 00:19:07,280
attributes which in this case the domain

528
00:19:07,280 --> 00:19:09,360
and client id

529
00:19:09,360 --> 00:19:11,760
the property is asking the browser to be

530
00:19:11,760 --> 00:19:13,280
notified when the value of

531
00:19:13,280 --> 00:19:16,880
any of these attributes change

532
00:19:16,880 --> 00:19:19,000
and then you can catch capture these

533
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:21,200
notifications from the browser by

534
00:19:21,200 --> 00:19:22,480
implementing

535
00:19:22,480 --> 00:19:24,880
the attribute change callback now the

536
00:19:24,880 --> 00:19:26,559
attribute change callback

537
00:19:26,559 --> 00:19:29,760
is a custom element reaction and

538
00:19:29,760 --> 00:19:31,840
you can implement it to handle some

539
00:19:31,840 --> 00:19:34,080
events in the lifecycle of the

540
00:19:34,080 --> 00:19:36,880
component and what what we're doing here

541
00:19:36,880 --> 00:19:38,320
is what i just said previously we're

542
00:19:38,320 --> 00:19:39,039
just

543
00:19:39,039 --> 00:19:41,280
capturing the notifications from the

544
00:19:41,280 --> 00:19:43,280
browser

545
00:19:43,280 --> 00:19:45,200
next we have a connected callback so

546
00:19:45,200 --> 00:19:47,440
this connected callback is also a custom

547
00:19:47,440 --> 00:19:49,200
element reaction

548
00:19:49,200 --> 00:19:51,120
and it's called when the component is

549
00:19:51,120 --> 00:19:54,000
added to the pages dom

550
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:55,919
now here what we're doing is we're

551
00:19:55,919 --> 00:19:59,120
creating an instance of the osiri client

552
00:19:59,120 --> 00:20:01,440
we're adding in a listener for the click

553
00:20:01,440 --> 00:20:03,200
event which we'll go into

554
00:20:03,200 --> 00:20:05,520
this in just a second we're then

555
00:20:05,520 --> 00:20:06,720
managing the result of the

556
00:20:06,720 --> 00:20:09,919
authentication and updating the ud

557
00:20:09,919 --> 00:20:13,120
ui based on the current authentication

558
00:20:13,120 --> 00:20:15,280
status

559
00:20:15,280 --> 00:20:17,120
so let's take a look at our event

560
00:20:17,120 --> 00:20:19,039
listener and here

561
00:20:19,039 --> 00:20:22,799
we have that it's just getting the um

562
00:20:22,799 --> 00:20:25,840
current authentication status of the

563
00:20:25,840 --> 00:20:26,880
user

564
00:20:26,880 --> 00:20:30,159
calls the login or logout method and

565
00:20:30,159 --> 00:20:30,799
then

566
00:20:30,799 --> 00:20:32,880
let's look at to see what these login

567
00:20:32,880 --> 00:20:35,120
and logout methods actually have

568
00:20:35,120 --> 00:20:39,600
so these have a login with direct

569
00:20:39,600 --> 00:20:42,320
and a logout method of the your serial

570
00:20:42,320 --> 00:20:42,799
client

571
00:20:42,799 --> 00:20:45,919
that's pretty straightforward here and

572
00:20:45,919 --> 00:20:46,320
then

573
00:20:46,320 --> 00:20:48,480
we have that handle redirect callback

574
00:20:48,480 --> 00:20:49,919
and the update ui

575
00:20:49,919 --> 00:20:52,640
so let's take a look at the update ui

576
00:20:52,640 --> 00:20:53,919
it's just

577
00:20:53,919 --> 00:20:56,320
displaying the correct text on the login

578
00:20:56,320 --> 00:20:57,120
button

579
00:20:57,120 --> 00:20:58,720
based on the current authentication

580
00:20:58,720 --> 00:21:00,159
status and

581
00:21:00,159 --> 00:21:03,120
handle redirect callback is managing the

582
00:21:03,120 --> 00:21:06,159
response coming from the all serial

583
00:21:06,159 --> 00:21:09,679
server after authentication right

584
00:21:09,679 --> 00:21:13,600
so we're basically done um

585
00:21:13,600 --> 00:21:16,799
as you can see we did a very

586
00:21:16,799 --> 00:21:19,360
simple process um it's just a login

587
00:21:19,360 --> 00:21:19,919
button

588
00:21:19,919 --> 00:21:21,919
that we have two that has two attributes

589
00:21:21,919 --> 00:21:24,320
the domain and client id

590
00:21:24,320 --> 00:21:26,720
um these you will find in your austere

591
00:21:26,720 --> 00:21:28,880
dashboard on your application

592
00:21:28,880 --> 00:21:31,520
so you can add those there if you want

593
00:21:31,520 --> 00:21:33,200
to take a closer look into my

594
00:21:33,200 --> 00:21:39,200
code feel free to it's on github.com

595
00:21:39,200 --> 00:21:41,919
i'm constantly working on it so there

596
00:21:41,919 --> 00:21:43,360
might be changes when you go check it

597
00:21:43,360 --> 00:21:45,280
out and i know that

598
00:21:45,280 --> 00:21:48,799
um a friend of mine is also helping out

599
00:21:48,799 --> 00:21:50,559
and sending in some pr's

600
00:21:50,559 --> 00:21:52,159
so if you have any suggestions please

601
00:21:52,159 --> 00:21:54,480
feel free to do so too

602
00:21:54,480 --> 00:21:58,240
so let's take a look at our login

603
00:21:58,240 --> 00:22:01,760
button so our login button

604
00:22:01,760 --> 00:22:05,760
is this and it's then going to take you

605
00:22:05,760 --> 00:22:07,520
to this login screen so let's see if

606
00:22:07,520 --> 00:22:09,360
that works

607
00:22:09,360 --> 00:22:13,520
going to our code this is basically

608
00:22:13,520 --> 00:22:15,679
the same as we just saw but instead of

609
00:22:15,679 --> 00:22:17,840
being on slides it's in an ide

610
00:22:17,840 --> 00:22:21,360
i did an npm mpn start sorry

611
00:22:21,360 --> 00:22:23,760
and then this is what it'll take you to

612
00:22:23,760 --> 00:22:24,880
you click in your

613
00:22:24,880 --> 00:22:27,919
you click on the login you continue with

614
00:22:27,919 --> 00:22:29,120
google in this case

615
00:22:29,120 --> 00:22:32,400
i choose my xero account and

616
00:22:32,400 --> 00:22:34,720
there we go and we get the update ui

617
00:22:34,720 --> 00:22:36,880
working nicely

618
00:22:36,880 --> 00:22:40,270
cool so this all works pretty nicely and

619
00:22:40,270 --> 00:22:41,919
[Music]

620
00:22:41,919 --> 00:22:44,480
remember how i said that i had actually

621
00:22:44,480 --> 00:22:45,840
built that

622
00:22:45,840 --> 00:22:50,400
with vanilla javascript sorry

623
00:22:50,400 --> 00:22:53,360
well there are other frameworks and

624
00:22:53,360 --> 00:22:55,440
libraries that we can actually use to

625
00:22:55,440 --> 00:22:55,919
create

626
00:22:55,919 --> 00:22:57,679
web components so let's just take a

627
00:22:57,679 --> 00:22:59,840
quick look at these because i'm running

628
00:22:59,840 --> 00:23:02,400
i'm running for that time so we have the

629
00:23:02,400 --> 00:23:04,480
lit element

630
00:23:04,480 --> 00:23:07,360
library which is my favorite but then

631
00:23:07,360 --> 00:23:09,840
they're skate.js there's hybridges

632
00:23:09,840 --> 00:23:13,280
lens stencil angular elements and

633
00:23:13,280 --> 00:23:16,320
so forth now it all depends on what you

634
00:23:16,320 --> 00:23:16,720
like

635
00:23:16,720 --> 00:23:18,480
you can test out different ones they're

636
00:23:18,480 --> 00:23:20,559
all very special and there's been a lot

637
00:23:20,559 --> 00:23:22,640
of work put into each and every one of

638
00:23:22,640 --> 00:23:23,679
them

639
00:23:23,679 --> 00:23:25,600
so that's pretty cool and that we don't

640
00:23:25,600 --> 00:23:26,799
have to

641
00:23:26,799 --> 00:23:30,559
build everything with just vanilla js

642
00:23:30,559 --> 00:23:33,840
so one thing that tends to worry

643
00:23:33,840 --> 00:23:37,360
us developers is the browser

644
00:23:37,360 --> 00:23:39,760
and i know that years ago when web

645
00:23:39,760 --> 00:23:41,360
components first came out browsers

646
00:23:41,360 --> 00:23:42,320
weren't ready

647
00:23:42,320 --> 00:23:43,840
which really put people off web

648
00:23:43,840 --> 00:23:45,600
components because they had to add loads

649
00:23:45,600 --> 00:23:47,279
of polyfill some of those polyfills

650
00:23:47,279 --> 00:23:48,960
weren't great

651
00:23:48,960 --> 00:23:52,000
um but i have news here and good news

652
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:54,799
uh the browser is fully stable as you

653
00:23:54,799 --> 00:23:56,320
can see

654
00:23:56,320 --> 00:23:59,919
um and also if we want to use older

655
00:23:59,919 --> 00:24:02,320
versions of the browsers then we do have

656
00:24:02,320 --> 00:24:05,039
really good polyfills so

657
00:24:05,039 --> 00:24:07,600
go ahead browsers are not excuse go

658
00:24:07,600 --> 00:24:08,640
experiment

659
00:24:08,640 --> 00:24:10,480
i'm very excited about web components

660
00:24:10,480 --> 00:24:12,080
because i can see they have a lot of

661
00:24:12,080 --> 00:24:13,200
potential

662
00:24:13,200 --> 00:24:15,760
and i hope you are as excited as i am

663
00:24:15,760 --> 00:24:17,360
after my talk

664
00:24:17,360 --> 00:24:20,720
so just before i go into questions i
