00:03:30,930 --> 00:03:33,930
the winner and capital in our crease we

50
00:03:33,930 --> 00:03:37,140
are going to have four categories the

51
00:03:37,140 --> 00:03:40,890
first category is about devil days all

52
00:03:40,890 --> 00:03:43,170
of the participants here in the live

53
00:03:43,170 --> 00:03:46,139
stream then over their hope day basis

54
00:03:46,139 --> 00:03:49,410
because they are also called organizers

55
00:03:49,410 --> 00:03:51,870
from different era blazes we're gonna

56
00:03:51,870 --> 00:03:54,690
talk about tooling because yeah any type

57
00:03:54,690 --> 00:03:57,000
of days quiz needs to be about tooling

58
00:03:57,000 --> 00:04:00,510
huh and then because we are going to

59
00:04:00,510 --> 00:04:02,459
pull it in a later we are going to talk

60
00:04:02,459 --> 00:04:05,310
about security and then a lot of sorry a

61
00:04:05,310 --> 00:04:08,160
question that didn't really fit in one

62
00:04:08,160 --> 00:04:14,549
of the other topics really yeah don't

63
00:04:14,549 --> 00:04:17,850
think you need to know the faster

64
00:04:17,850 --> 00:04:21,000
answers get more points the quiz will

65
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:24,990
last about 20 minutes sometimes there is

66
00:04:24,990 --> 00:04:26,550
more than one answer

67
00:04:26,550 --> 00:04:31,650
so read very carefully and unclick as

68
00:04:31,650 --> 00:04:33,389
much as possible if you think it's

69
00:04:33,389 --> 00:04:36,300
necessary and you get 20 seconds per

70
00:04:36,300 --> 00:04:39,259

74
00:04:59,940 --> 00:05:04,669

226
00:22:31,590 --> 00:22:33,990
little bit over time if your software

00:22:44,580 --> 00:22:51,840
licensing or human error that's what I

232
00:22:51,840 --> 00:22:56,820
was thinking of this is the important

233
00:22:56,820 --> 00:22:59,460
bit then we need to memorize the hpid 10

234
00:22:59,460 --> 00:23:03,900
Tierra right as long as we know who to

235
00:23:03,900 --> 00:23:05,880
blame then we're okay you know it's all

236
00:23:05,880 --> 00:23:08,510
about to blame Oh

when it's a combination of both DNS and

239
00:23:23,679 --> 00:23:30,970
Wi-Fi yeah yeah the human error trying

240
00:23:30,970 --> 00:23:32,380
to shift to different wireless access

241
00:23:32,380 --> 00:23:34,230
points trying to get it to work that's

242
00:23:34,230 --> 00:23:40,030
yeah okay watch it the oldest is it CBS

243

244
00:23:45,160 --> 00:23:55,690

249
00:24:17,799 --> 00:24:22,179
points low indeed or yet the somewhat

250
00:24:22,179 --> 00:24:26,020
older than PVA yeah I remember that

251
00:24:26,020 --> 00:24:28,900
because I remember a bunch of CVS when I

252
00:24:28,900 --> 00:24:30,880
was merging with CVS a bunch of RCS

253
00:24:30,880 --> 00:24:32,650
files being present in there so he knows

254
00:24:32,650 --> 00:24:39,820
my grades the CVS okay number 16 and get

255
00:24:39,820 --> 00:24:43,000

you do realize I'm over 20 25 percent

258
00:25:00,600 --> 00:25:05,700
chance of getting this stuff right to do

259
00:25:05,700 --> 00:25:07,440
it very quickly and I hope it gives me

260
00:25:07,440 --> 00:25:14,880
some advantage no culture question no

261
00:25:14,880 --> 00:25:17,100
edge out questions nothing

262
00:25:17,100 --> 00:25:18,900
whenever I get something right I feel

263
00:25:18,900 --> 00:25:21,630
really really badly about you people

264

266
00:25:27,060 --> 00:25:29,340
and you have two types of comments

267
00:25:29,340 --> 00:25:32,100
floating in porcelaine comments and want

268
00:25:32,100 --> 00:25:33,480
to use most of the time on the

269
00:25:33,480 --> 00:25:35,640
porcelaine comment but maybe some people

270
00:25:35,640 --> 00:25:39,480

00:30:50,600 --> 00:30:56,749
they have been putting me it is they

333
00:30:56,749 --> 00:31:01,549
were good unless the ticker symbol there

334
00:31:01,549 --> 00:31:08,659
you go okay I do appreciate that the

335
00:31:08,659 --> 00:31:10,700
axial zoom ticker symbol they're seeing

336
00:31:10,700 --> 00:31:13,940
a spike in and purchases as well keep

337
00:31:13,940 --> 00:31:14,960
forgetting it

338
00:31:14,960 --> 00:31:19,250
[Laughter]

339
00:31:20,110 --> 00:31:24,860
okay question 22 who said a

340
00:31:24,860 --> 00:31:27,710
cryptographic system should be secure

341
00:31:27,710 --> 00:31:29,480
even if everything about the system

342
00:31:29,480 --> 00:31:32,269
except the key is public knowledge was

343
00:31:32,269 --> 00:31:35,409
that Alan Turing Julius Caesar

344
00:31:35,409 --> 00:31:40,460
Auguste Jericho or word rose riders Adi

345
00:31:40,460 --> 00:31:41,990
Shamir and lair

346
00:31:41,990 --> 00:31:46,759
Layana Adelman so who said this which

347
00:31:46,759 --> 00:31:57,590
one of them is frontier and actually a

348
00:31:57,590 --> 00:32:03,470
good scarecrow he's a Dutchman finally

349
00:32:03,470 --> 00:32:04,820
someone we can be proud of

350
00:32:04,820 --> 00:32:21,909
right again like ten minutes overtime

351
00:32:21,909 --> 00:32:27,529
GDP our stands for global data

352
00:32:27,529 --> 00:32:30,440
protection rules general data protection

353
00:32:30,440 --> 00:32:33,919
regulation general data privacy rules or

354
00:32:33,919 --> 00:32:46,100
a global directive of privacy rule so

355
00:32:46,100 --> 00:32:47,149
you got three of them that you have to

356
00:32:47,149 --> 00:32:49,850
make up the forest one global or global

357
00:32:49,850 --> 00:32:52,240
we could do that

358
00:33:01,460 --> 00:33:03,649
I mean sometimes Europeans like thinking

359
00:33:03,649 --> 00:33:05,600
that you know they're global but like it

360
00:33:05,600 --> 00:33:11,570
just applies the test disk the American

361
00:33:11,570 --> 00:33:21,529
in you were playing up playing up next

362
00:33:21,529 --> 00:33:26,169
category the what

363
00:33:27,009 --> 00:33:29,509
The Devil's handbook talks about the

364
00:33:29,509 --> 00:33:32,389
three-way switch principles are the

365
00:33:32,389 --> 00:33:38,269
second crystals are flow with of

366
00:33:38,269 --> 00:33:40,429
continual learning or the principles of

367
00:33:40,429 --> 00:33:49,249
feedback so who didn't read that book I

368
00:33:49,249 --> 00:33:52,149
think we're stuck again and I bought it

369
00:33:52,149 --> 00:33:55,389
you bought it

370
00:33:55,690 --> 00:34:11,780
it's not stuck for me my kid so bus this

371
00:34:11,780 --> 00:34:15,050
is the one I expect you idiot right I

372
00:34:15,050 --> 00:34:26,418
think my screen froze right Mike day

373
00:34:26,418 --> 00:34:29,599
number 25 how many pages does the

374
00:34:29,599 --> 00:34:38,020
devil's handbook count for 65 2485 10

375
00:34:38,020 --> 00:34:41,589
now it is time to take a book cover and

376
00:34:41,589 --> 00:34:47,409
yeah and so it's on my Kindle and more

377
00:34:47,409 --> 00:34:49,550
there's your concept of pages when we

378
00:34:49,550 --> 00:34:51,889
can go yeah yeah there you go

379
00:34:51,889 --> 00:34:53,839
I've done a very good eyesight so

380
00:34:53,839 --> 00:35:05,450
thousands of pages for me this is a

381
00:35:05,450 --> 00:35:08,920
completely random answer again yeah I

382
00:35:08,920 --> 00:35:15,290
gotta read though yes nice 480 oh I

383
00:35:15,290 --> 00:35:18,400
think many people have a little bit

384
00:35:18,400 --> 00:35:24,280
further than 80 next one

385
00:35:28,029 --> 00:35:30,529
we won't be able to do all the question

386
00:35:30,529 --> 00:35:34,279
yeah who did not go author the DevOps

387
00:35:34,279 --> 00:35:39,289
handbook Jeff humble John Oscar Patrick

388
00:35:39,289 --> 00:35:41,960
Dubois or John Wallace which one of them

389
00:35:41,960 --> 00:35:47,020
was not a co-author of the devil

390
00:36:01,280 --> 00:36:04,419
[Music]

391
00:36:07,210 --> 00:36:09,230
actually three the speeches looked like

392
00:36:09,230 --> 00:36:10,880
they could have been lifted straight off

393
00:36:10,880 --> 00:36:13,990
the book that should have been a clue

394
00:36:17,619 --> 00:36:19,400
mr. Allspark

395
00:36:19,400 --> 00:36:24,069
yeah but he wrote the foreword reduction

396
00:36:24,069 --> 00:36:37,039
but you another and maybe need one wrong

397
00:36:37,039 --> 00:36:44,569
answer from Sauron let's make this the

398
00:36:44,569 --> 00:36:47,900
last question hard yeah you want to make

399
00:36:47,900 --> 00:36:50,349
this last one yeah

400
00:36:50,349 --> 00:36:53,750
muda is a Japanese term in liens that

401
00:36:53,750 --> 00:36:58,480
means radical change wasteful activity

402
00:36:58,480 --> 00:37:04,309
self-reflection or imbalance we are

403
00:37:04,309 --> 00:37:06,380
certainly in a period of self-reflection

404
00:37:06,380 --> 00:37:14,710
at the moment your mother sorry Buddha

405
