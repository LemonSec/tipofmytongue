uh joining us now is scott gerlack

2
00:00:03,679 --> 00:00:06,960
he is the co-founder of stackhawk and

3
00:00:06,960 --> 00:00:08,960
scott's going to talk to us today

4
00:00:08,960 --> 00:00:10,800
about some of the challenges that

5
00:00:10,800 --> 00:00:12,160
developers have

6
00:00:12,160 --> 00:00:15,200
when it comes to application security a

7
00:00:15,200 --> 00:00:17,119
reminder throw your questions

8
00:00:17,119 --> 00:00:20,160
into the q a panel and we will cover

9
00:00:20,160 --> 00:00:20,960
those with scott

10
00:00:20,960 --> 00:00:23,920
at the end of his talk with that scott i

11
00:00:23,920 --> 00:00:26,960
am going to turn it over to you

12
00:00:26,960 --> 00:00:30,080
awesome thanks melissa

13
00:00:30,080 --> 00:00:32,479
everybody what's up all the talks

14
00:00:32,479 --> 00:00:34,239
everyone that's participating

15
00:00:34,239 --> 00:00:36,160
uh i'm scott gerlach we're talking about

16
00:00:36,160 --> 00:00:37,840
three reasons developers struggle with

17
00:00:37,840 --> 00:00:38,719
absec

18
00:00:38,719 --> 00:00:41,760
and how to make it easier today uh like

19
00:00:41,760 --> 00:00:43,360
i said i'm scott gerlock this is my

20
00:00:43,360 --> 00:00:44,399
quarantine here

21
00:00:44,399 --> 00:00:46,000
i hope everyone enjoys that because it

22
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:47,440
makes me feel great

23
00:00:47,440 --> 00:00:50,640
uh i'm the cso as alyssa mentioned cso

24
00:00:50,640 --> 00:00:52,320
co-founder of stackhawk

25
00:00:52,320 --> 00:00:54,559
uh i was the ciso at cengrid for three

26
00:00:54,559 --> 00:00:56,559
years a senior security architect at

27
00:00:56,559 --> 00:00:58,480
godaddy for

28
00:00:58,480 --> 00:01:01,760
a long long time nine years um husband

29
00:01:01,760 --> 00:01:02,480
brewer

30
00:01:02,480 --> 00:01:05,680
dad golfer etc etc you can see my

31
00:01:05,680 --> 00:01:07,520
twitter and linkedin handles there if

32
00:01:07,520 --> 00:01:08,799
you need to get a hold of me at some

33
00:01:08,799 --> 00:01:11,040
point

34
00:01:11,040 --> 00:01:13,040
brief warning before we get started some

35
00:01:13,040 --> 00:01:14,799
of the things i'm going to say in this

36
00:01:14,799 --> 00:01:17,920
uh in this talk maybe uh may

37
00:01:17,920 --> 00:01:19,600
may attack you on a personal level but

38
00:01:19,600 --> 00:01:20,960
that's not what they're intended to do

39
00:01:20,960 --> 00:01:22,720
we're trying to point out some of the

40
00:01:22,720 --> 00:01:24,479
some of the things and the flaws and

41
00:01:24,479 --> 00:01:25,759
thinking that are preventing us from

42
00:01:25,759 --> 00:01:26,080
being

43
00:01:26,080 --> 00:01:30,400
successful in our appsec programs

44
00:01:30,880 --> 00:01:33,600
uh real quickly appsec problem overview

45
00:01:33,600 --> 00:01:34,240
appsec

46
00:01:34,240 --> 00:01:37,759
is good in theory uh just covering some

47
00:01:37,759 --> 00:01:39,040
of the tools that are out there right

48
00:01:39,040 --> 00:01:41,119
now some of the categories of tools

49
00:01:41,119 --> 00:01:44,320
static code analysis uh looking at

50
00:01:44,320 --> 00:01:45,439
source code

51
00:01:45,439 --> 00:01:48,479
dependency libraries etc these are

52
00:01:48,479 --> 00:01:51,040
sometimes noisy and often lack

53
00:01:51,040 --> 00:01:52,880
application context how is this code

54
00:01:52,880 --> 00:01:54,000
being used what is it

55
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:56,320
actually doing is it only being used in

56
00:01:56,320 --> 00:01:57,840
dev etc

57
00:01:57,840 --> 00:02:01,119
uh and then language dependent so um

58
00:02:01,119 --> 00:02:03,360
obviously if you've got some languages

59
00:02:03,360 --> 00:02:04,479
that are not supported

60
00:02:04,479 --> 00:02:06,640
go being one of my favorites uh sigrid

61
00:02:06,640 --> 00:02:08,399
was a big go uh

62
00:02:08,399 --> 00:02:10,239
shop and there's not a lot of great

63
00:02:10,239 --> 00:02:13,599
tools for go out there right now

64
00:02:13,599 --> 00:02:16,319
uh dynamic code analysis or dast uh

65
00:02:16,319 --> 00:02:17,200
these are better at

66
00:02:17,200 --> 00:02:19,120
actual app and context but they're still

67
00:02:19,120 --> 00:02:20,560
somewhat noisy right and they're tough

68
00:02:20,560 --> 00:02:22,879
to configure sort of tough to configure

69
00:02:22,879 --> 00:02:24,160
to be able to scan

70
00:02:24,160 --> 00:02:26,560
an application in context and they're

71
00:02:26,560 --> 00:02:28,480
hard to use they're built for security

72
00:02:28,480 --> 00:02:29,599
people

73
00:02:29,599 --> 00:02:32,239
and then rasp i asked waff this is all

74
00:02:32,239 --> 00:02:33,680
kind of the

75
00:02:33,680 --> 00:02:36,480
wait till someone finds it in prod type

76
00:02:36,480 --> 00:02:37,680
of scenario

77
00:02:37,680 --> 00:02:40,000
and these are great as a backstopping

78
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:40,800
tool so

79
00:02:40,800 --> 00:02:42,959
as you do your appsec lifecycle and

80
00:02:42,959 --> 00:02:45,760
you've made your way through

81
00:02:45,760 --> 00:02:48,000
design and development and then you've

82
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:49,360
you've got what you think is a pretty

83
00:02:49,360 --> 00:02:51,200
solid thing out in production these are

84
00:02:51,200 --> 00:02:53,360
the thing that can help back you up from

85
00:02:53,360 --> 00:02:55,760
actual attacks

86
00:02:55,760 --> 00:02:58,319
appsec is super hard to scale all these

87
00:02:58,319 --> 00:02:59,280
solutions need

88
00:02:59,280 --> 00:03:01,440
people specifically security people to

89
00:03:01,440 --> 00:03:03,680
be super effective

90
00:03:03,680 --> 00:03:05,519
maybe sas doesn't necessarily and

91
00:03:05,519 --> 00:03:06,800
there's some good tools that are trying

92
00:03:06,800 --> 00:03:08,560
to change that

93
00:03:08,560 --> 00:03:10,879
but there's no real try and buy

94
00:03:10,879 --> 00:03:12,640
everything's hidden behind the contact

95
00:03:12,640 --> 00:03:13,599
us for a demo

96
00:03:13,599 --> 00:03:16,959
sales cycle it's really tough to kind of

97
00:03:16,959 --> 00:03:17,599
figure out

98
00:03:17,599 --> 00:03:20,640
really quickly are these things good for

99
00:03:20,640 --> 00:03:25,040
our company and our appsec program

100
00:03:25,120 --> 00:03:27,280
and they're really really expensive so

101
00:03:27,280 --> 00:03:28,640
all these tools are

102
00:03:28,640 --> 00:03:31,840
most of these tools are six figure five

103
00:03:31,840 --> 00:03:32,640
high five

104
00:03:32,640 --> 00:03:35,200
six-figure contract type tools that

105
00:03:35,200 --> 00:03:36,799
you're locked into

106
00:03:36,799 --> 00:03:40,560
a one-year at least type of a contract

107
00:03:40,560 --> 00:03:42,400
uh and so i took a picture of the actual

108
00:03:42,400 --> 00:03:43,920
amount of money i've spent trying to

109
00:03:43,920 --> 00:03:46,159
build appsec programs over the years

110
00:03:46,159 --> 00:03:49,519
um this is for real money no it's not

111
00:03:49,519 --> 00:03:50,319
for real money

112
00:03:50,319 --> 00:03:53,519
anyway really really hard to to

113
00:03:53,519 --> 00:03:56,159
buy and you get you get all these great

114
00:03:56,159 --> 00:03:57,840
tools and you try them out and you go

115
00:03:57,840 --> 00:03:58,319
and

116
00:03:58,319 --> 00:04:01,040
man this can really make my appsec

117
00:04:01,040 --> 00:04:03,360
program really really strong and good

118
00:04:03,360 --> 00:04:05,120
and i'm going to bring it in house i've

119
00:04:05,120 --> 00:04:07,439
run some demos on some of our apps

120
00:04:07,439 --> 00:04:09,280
getting good results i want the

121
00:04:09,280 --> 00:04:12,799
developer community to run these tools

122
00:04:12,799 --> 00:04:14,480
and then we start doing security things

123
00:04:14,480 --> 00:04:16,238
to it and we start going okay

124
00:04:16,238 --> 00:04:19,600
no one can be admin except for me uh i'm

125
00:04:19,600 --> 00:04:22,160
our security department is gonna be the

126
00:04:22,160 --> 00:04:22,960
champion

127
00:04:22,960 --> 00:04:25,280
of uh we are the only ones that can

128
00:04:25,280 --> 00:04:27,199
approve things and let things go

129
00:04:27,199 --> 00:04:28,880
through the development cycle or

130
00:04:28,880 --> 00:04:30,479
blocking builds or

131
00:04:30,479 --> 00:04:34,400
deciding what is actually risky um

132
00:04:34,400 --> 00:04:36,240
and then what we end up with doing is is

133
00:04:36,240 --> 00:04:38,160
taking that awesome security tool and it

134
00:04:38,160 --> 00:04:39,520
dies on the vine because we

135
00:04:39,520 --> 00:04:43,360
kill it we just we we tommy boyed up a

136
00:04:43,360 --> 00:04:45,040
little bit

137
00:04:45,040 --> 00:04:47,840
uh and then we wonder three four five

138
00:04:47,840 --> 00:04:48,960
months in

139
00:04:48,960 --> 00:04:50,639
man why is this tool not being

140
00:04:50,639 --> 00:04:52,639
successful when i demoed it and we tried

141
00:04:52,639 --> 00:04:53,040
it

142
00:04:53,040 --> 00:04:55,360
we were getting good results out of it

143
00:04:55,360 --> 00:04:57,440
we had a couple developers try it out

144
00:04:57,440 --> 00:04:58,560
and they were like yes

145
00:04:58,560 --> 00:05:01,919
it's okay uh and and we

146
00:05:01,919 --> 00:05:05,120
we wonder how come that's happening and

147
00:05:05,120 --> 00:05:06,479
we're gonna get into some of that stuff

148
00:05:06,479 --> 00:05:09,199
but i think part of that is because of

149
00:05:09,199 --> 00:05:12,639
our trust issues we have issues trusting

150
00:05:12,639 --> 00:05:14,240
the people that we've hired throughout

151
00:05:14,240 --> 00:05:16,080
the company to be able to do their jobs

152
00:05:16,080 --> 00:05:18,160
and do their jobs effectively

153
00:05:18,160 --> 00:05:21,360
i was at b-sides rsa earlier this year

154
00:05:21,360 --> 00:05:22,960
and this is a tweet that charlie sent

155
00:05:22,960 --> 00:05:25,199
out and if charlie's watching or people

156
00:05:25,199 --> 00:05:27,039
know charlie i hope no one gets angry at

157
00:05:27,039 --> 00:05:28,880
me for this but

158
00:05:28,880 --> 00:05:30,639
he said i'm not sure i'm not sure if a

159
00:05:30,639 --> 00:05:32,479
new hire dev is in a position to

160
00:05:32,479 --> 00:05:33,759
evaluate risk

161
00:05:33,759 --> 00:05:36,080
for a feature product or company i think

162
00:05:36,080 --> 00:05:37,680
professional security people can do this

163
00:05:37,680 --> 00:05:39,120
better

164
00:05:39,120 --> 00:05:42,479
and it strikes me that this has um

165
00:05:42,479 --> 00:05:47,199
so much non-how developers work

166
00:05:47,199 --> 00:05:50,400
cooked into it a new hire developer

167
00:05:50,400 --> 00:05:53,039
also isn't in the position probably to

168
00:05:53,039 --> 00:05:54,639
in a silo

169
00:05:54,639 --> 00:05:57,280
push code to production or understand

170
00:05:57,280 --> 00:05:57,919
how the

171
00:05:57,919 --> 00:06:00,000
code that he's working on he or she is

172
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:01,039
working on

173
00:06:01,039 --> 00:06:02,800
affects the other code bases that you're

174
00:06:02,800 --> 00:06:05,039
interacting with so

175
00:06:05,039 --> 00:06:07,600
this this tweet kind of says you know

176
00:06:07,600 --> 00:06:09,440
i'm going to bring on a new hire dev

177
00:06:09,440 --> 00:06:11,759
and they're instantly going to be uh

178
00:06:11,759 --> 00:06:13,199
making

179
00:06:13,199 --> 00:06:15,120
huge decisions within the organization

180
00:06:15,120 --> 00:06:17,280
and i i think that's

181
00:06:17,280 --> 00:06:19,120
i'm not sure that's his intent but

182
00:06:19,120 --> 00:06:20,800
that's what i read that as

183
00:06:20,800 --> 00:06:23,039
and and i like to think of this as more

184
00:06:23,039 --> 00:06:24,400
of uh

185
00:06:24,400 --> 00:06:25,840
i wouldn't want to put a new hired

186
00:06:25,840 --> 00:06:27,520
developer in the position of making an

187
00:06:27,520 --> 00:06:28,400
uninformed

188
00:06:28,400 --> 00:06:32,000
risk decision i don't so much mind that

189
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:33,199
a developer makes

190
00:06:33,199 --> 00:06:36,880
a risk decision as long as they document

191
00:06:36,880 --> 00:06:38,400
it for me somewhere

192
00:06:38,400 --> 00:06:40,240
or they write something down or make a

193
00:06:40,240 --> 00:06:41,520
note in a repo or

194
00:06:41,520 --> 00:06:42,800
something so that i can have a

195
00:06:42,800 --> 00:06:45,039
conversation about you know why was that

196
00:06:45,039 --> 00:06:46,800
decision made

197
00:06:46,800 --> 00:06:48,800
so i think that's a better way to kind

198
00:06:48,800 --> 00:06:50,880
of tackle that and and get through that

199
00:06:50,880 --> 00:06:51,520
trust

200
00:06:51,520 --> 00:06:53,680
trust and support thing but really this

201
00:06:53,680 --> 00:06:55,680
is one of the keys to how we

202
00:06:55,680 --> 00:06:57,599
silo the security and engineering

203
00:06:57,599 --> 00:06:59,680
departments is we kind of build that

204
00:06:59,680 --> 00:07:01,520
animosity in between those

205
00:07:01,520 --> 00:07:05,360
departments by not saying hey we trust

206
00:07:05,360 --> 00:07:07,440
you know the company hired you

207
00:07:07,440 --> 00:07:09,120
engineering leadership hired you and

208
00:07:09,120 --> 00:07:10,160
they trust you

209
00:07:10,160 --> 00:07:12,080
but i don't because i'm a security guy

210
00:07:12,080 --> 00:07:14,400
and i don't trust anybody

211
00:07:14,400 --> 00:07:15,919
but we're all in the same place trying

212
00:07:15,919 --> 00:07:17,440
to make the same thing happen for the

213
00:07:17,440 --> 00:07:19,840
company

214
00:07:19,919 --> 00:07:21,840
ultimately we care differently as

215
00:07:21,840 --> 00:07:24,000
security people and developers

216
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:26,319
uh devs tend to care about in this

217
00:07:26,319 --> 00:07:27,759
specific order

218
00:07:27,759 --> 00:07:31,360
performance quality ease of use

219
00:07:31,360 --> 00:07:34,000
efficiency and security and next to

220
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:35,440
those things i've put some of the tools

221
00:07:35,440 --> 00:07:35,840
that

222
00:07:35,840 --> 00:07:38,639
that help them instrument those things

223
00:07:38,639 --> 00:07:40,720
so performance we've got the time tool

224
00:07:40,720 --> 00:07:42,560
and some load test

225
00:07:42,560 --> 00:07:44,560
under quality we've got unit tests and

226
00:07:44,560 --> 00:07:46,240
integration tests

227
00:07:46,240 --> 00:07:48,080
ease of use you've got linters so people

228
00:07:48,080 --> 00:07:49,599
can look at code and they understand how

229
00:07:49,599 --> 00:07:50,319
that works

230
00:07:50,319 --> 00:07:53,520
and user user experience efficiency we

231
00:07:53,520 --> 00:07:54,800
can look at how the

232
00:07:54,800 --> 00:07:57,840
application is using memory heap and

233
00:07:57,840 --> 00:07:59,520
then that last one security

234
00:07:59,520 --> 00:08:01,919
i guess they use google to understand

235
00:08:01,919 --> 00:08:05,120
stack overflow to understand security

236
00:08:05,120 --> 00:08:07,840
um and really they care about those

237
00:08:07,840 --> 00:08:08,800
things in

238
00:08:08,800 --> 00:08:11,680
specific order that they can easily know

239
00:08:11,680 --> 00:08:12,960
and make decisions on

240
00:08:12,960 --> 00:08:15,520
so the easier it is for them to go yep i

241
00:08:15,520 --> 00:08:16,800
understand this i can move on to the

242
00:08:16,800 --> 00:08:18,160
next thing yep i understand this i can

243
00:08:18,160 --> 00:08:19,360
move on to the next thing

244
00:08:19,360 --> 00:08:21,120
the more they'll make those decisions

245
00:08:21,120 --> 00:08:22,560
and then

246
00:08:22,560 --> 00:08:24,800
infosec teams we tend to care about in

247
00:08:24,800 --> 00:08:27,840
this order security security security

248
00:08:27,840 --> 00:08:29,360
and then maybe some feelings down at the

249
00:08:29,360 --> 00:08:31,120
bottom occasionally

250
00:08:31,120 --> 00:08:34,320
uh people are taking all of those

251
00:08:34,320 --> 00:08:36,399
bits and bytes and code that they write

252
00:08:36,399 --> 00:08:38,159
and they feel really passionate about

253
00:08:38,159 --> 00:08:39,039
them that it's

254
00:08:39,039 --> 00:08:42,159
art to them right it's artwork and when

255
00:08:42,159 --> 00:08:42,958
we get to

256
00:08:42,958 --> 00:08:46,240
do our job we don't take the we don't

257
00:08:46,240 --> 00:08:47,920
take that fact into account while we're

258
00:08:47,920 --> 00:08:50,800
talking to people about these things

259
00:08:50,800 --> 00:08:52,560
uh real quickly i want to talk about the

260
00:08:52,560 --> 00:08:54,720
evolution of linting

261
00:08:54,720 --> 00:08:57,200
way back in days of old we had code

262
00:08:57,200 --> 00:08:59,120
standards documentation

263
00:08:59,120 --> 00:09:01,279
and corporate they would read something

264
00:09:01,279 --> 00:09:02,800
like corporate hath deemed thou

265
00:09:02,800 --> 00:09:05,200
shalt use spaces not tabs thine

266
00:09:05,200 --> 00:09:07,040
indentation shalt be three and a half

267
00:09:07,040 --> 00:09:08,080
spaces

268
00:09:08,080 --> 00:09:12,000
etc etc etc and that it was the

269
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:13,680
developer's job to read

270
00:09:13,680 --> 00:09:15,440
that code standards documentation and

271
00:09:15,440 --> 00:09:16,800
implement it in their code

272
00:09:16,800 --> 00:09:19,279
which is ridiculous like how are you

273
00:09:19,279 --> 00:09:20,240
gonna

274
00:09:20,240 --> 00:09:23,760
remember a 30-page documentation book

275
00:09:23,760 --> 00:09:26,720
and then write code so developers do

276
00:09:26,720 --> 00:09:27,839
what developers do

277
00:09:27,839 --> 00:09:29,440
they said look this is a job for

278
00:09:29,440 --> 00:09:31,360
computers computers can do this super

279
00:09:31,360 --> 00:09:32,320
effectively

280
00:09:32,320 --> 00:09:35,120
we can write our linting rules uh

281
00:09:35,120 --> 00:09:36,560
someone's done the heavy linting and

282
00:09:36,560 --> 00:09:38,320
documenting for us

283
00:09:38,320 --> 00:09:40,399
and then we add little tiny rules on top

284
00:09:40,399 --> 00:09:42,160
of that to make code more readable

285
00:09:42,160 --> 00:09:45,279
more reliable across the organization we

286
00:09:45,279 --> 00:09:47,040
can check it while we're writing code so

287
00:09:47,040 --> 00:09:48,720
it shows up in our ide

288
00:09:48,720 --> 00:09:51,279
we can run a lint uh on our local code

289
00:09:51,279 --> 00:09:52,800
base before we commit it

290
00:09:52,800 --> 00:09:54,560
and then ci pipeline can back that up

291
00:09:54,560 --> 00:09:56,240
for us so as other people are committing

292
00:09:56,240 --> 00:09:56,880
code

293
00:09:56,880 --> 00:09:58,880
they're held to the same same coding

294
00:09:58,880 --> 00:10:02,000
standards that we've instrumented

295
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:04,399
which is awesome that's how devs want to

296
00:10:04,399 --> 00:10:06,079
work

297
00:10:06,079 --> 00:10:08,320
so problem number one uh problem number

298
00:10:08,320 --> 00:10:10,720
one is about knowing absec

299
00:10:10,720 --> 00:10:14,399
or at least being able to make decisions

300
00:10:15,440 --> 00:10:18,079
probably in one of these talks somewhere

301
00:10:18,079 --> 00:10:20,000
and i know matthias was talking about it

302
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:20,959
earlier

303
00:10:20,959 --> 00:10:22,959
we go let's teach developers how to

304
00:10:22,959 --> 00:10:26,079
write secure code

305
00:10:26,560 --> 00:10:29,040
and we if we we think that if they know

306
00:10:29,040 --> 00:10:30,560
how attackers think they'll be able to

307
00:10:30,560 --> 00:10:32,320
test like an attacker and we say hack

308
00:10:32,320 --> 00:10:32,880
yourself

309
00:10:32,880 --> 00:10:36,000
and and all these good things but we put

310
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:37,519
all these roadblocks in the way to make

311
00:10:37,519 --> 00:10:39,440
this really really effective there's

312
00:10:39,440 --> 00:10:41,440
a ton of new acronyms that you have to

313
00:10:41,440 --> 00:10:43,519
learn to be able to understand

314
00:10:43,519 --> 00:10:46,959
uh how to do application security

315
00:10:46,959 --> 00:10:49,279
in fact there's two for one thing csrf

316
00:10:49,279 --> 00:10:50,240
xsrf

317
00:10:50,240 --> 00:10:52,480
that's even confusing for me and i work

318
00:10:52,480 --> 00:10:53,279
in the industry

319
00:10:53,279 --> 00:10:55,440
um but then before we do that let's talk

320
00:10:55,440 --> 00:10:56,399
about risk so

321
00:10:56,399 --> 00:10:58,160
we should know how to calculate risk and

322
00:10:58,160 --> 00:11:00,240
we should know that uh

323
00:11:00,240 --> 00:11:03,440
likelihood and impact equals risk and

324
00:11:03,440 --> 00:11:04,880
you guys should know that because

325
00:11:04,880 --> 00:11:06,880
developers also should know understand

326
00:11:06,880 --> 00:11:07,440
that for

327
00:11:07,440 --> 00:11:09,360
but wait also did you know the internet

328
00:11:09,360 --> 00:11:12,240
is bad bad things happen on the internet

329
00:11:12,240 --> 00:11:15,040
um and then so we get into this loop of

330
00:11:15,040 --> 00:11:17,440
like hey we want to teach you stuff

331
00:11:17,440 --> 00:11:18,880
that's not your job we want to teach you

332
00:11:18,880 --> 00:11:20,560
to be us as

333
00:11:20,560 --> 00:11:23,920
absec pros um and no one and everyone's

334
00:11:23,920 --> 00:11:24,399
like

335
00:11:24,399 --> 00:11:27,200
okay i guess a little extra knowledge

336
00:11:27,200 --> 00:11:29,120
can't hurt and then

337
00:11:29,120 --> 00:11:31,040
if you've ever done an apsec training

338
00:11:31,040 --> 00:11:32,160
program

339
00:11:32,160 --> 00:11:34,560
i've done a couple of them and here's

340
00:11:34,560 --> 00:11:36,399
how it usually goes

341
00:11:36,399 --> 00:11:39,760
hey engineering leadership i need five

342
00:11:39,760 --> 00:11:41,760
of your best people

343
00:11:41,760 --> 00:11:43,920
best engineers to send to a security

344
00:11:43,920 --> 00:11:45,040
training program

345
00:11:45,040 --> 00:11:46,480
i want to teach them how to think like

346
00:11:46,480 --> 00:11:49,600
attackers thinking teach them how to see

347
00:11:49,600 --> 00:11:53,360
vulnerable code in an in codebase

348
00:11:53,360 --> 00:11:55,920
and be able to fix those things and so

349
00:11:55,920 --> 00:11:56,720
then the

350
00:11:56,720 --> 00:11:58,320
engineering leadership goes yeah

351
00:11:58,320 --> 00:11:59,839
absolutely here's my five

352
00:11:59,839 --> 00:12:02,959
best people who are likely not going to

353
00:12:02,959 --> 00:12:05,040
make these mistakes in the first place

354
00:12:05,040 --> 00:12:07,040
uh they're way too busy shipping

355
00:12:07,040 --> 00:12:08,160
features because we really

356
00:12:08,160 --> 00:12:10,320
rely on them heavily to be the leaders

357
00:12:10,320 --> 00:12:12,079
of the engineering organization

358
00:12:12,079 --> 00:12:14,880
to go out and train other developers in

359
00:12:14,880 --> 00:12:17,120
the absence ways

360
00:12:17,120 --> 00:12:20,399
uh and in fact i've asked the uh some of

361
00:12:20,399 --> 00:12:22,320
my engineers that i've sent to training

362
00:12:22,320 --> 00:12:25,040
hey when you come back from this program

363
00:12:25,040 --> 00:12:27,040
if you see something in a code base that

364
00:12:27,040 --> 00:12:28,399
you're working on

365
00:12:28,399 --> 00:12:31,440
that you learned from and fix

366
00:12:31,440 --> 00:12:33,200
from this appsec program that you went

367
00:12:33,200 --> 00:12:35,680
to can you tag that for me

368
00:12:35,680 --> 00:12:38,320
in a in a pr or something so i can track

369
00:12:38,320 --> 00:12:39,200
that

370
00:12:39,200 --> 00:12:41,279
and put together you know we learned

371
00:12:41,279 --> 00:12:42,800
something out of this appsec program

372
00:12:42,800 --> 00:12:45,279
and we've implemented it in code and i

373
00:12:45,279 --> 00:12:47,040
don't think i've ever seen someone tag

374
00:12:47,040 --> 00:12:47,519
something

375
00:12:47,519 --> 00:12:50,560
in the code base uh for an organization

376
00:12:50,560 --> 00:12:54,160
that they learned from an apsec program

377
00:12:56,639 --> 00:13:01,440
and so the next thing we do is is we go

378
00:13:01,440 --> 00:13:05,760
hey when we want to teach you how to be

379
00:13:05,760 --> 00:13:07,920
us it's really important that you really

380
00:13:07,920 --> 00:13:09,200
learn how to be us

381
00:13:09,200 --> 00:13:12,000
how to be appsec professionals which is

382
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:13,360
weird to me

383
00:13:13,360 --> 00:13:15,120
because you never see the accountants do

384
00:13:15,120 --> 00:13:16,720
this to an executive when the exec

385
00:13:16,720 --> 00:13:18,560
exec team goes hey we need to model a

386
00:13:18,560 --> 00:13:20,320
price increase

387
00:13:20,320 --> 00:13:23,360
or change the cost structure for one of

388
00:13:23,360 --> 00:13:23,680
these

389
00:13:23,680 --> 00:13:26,240
products that we have dear accounting

390
00:13:26,240 --> 00:13:27,600
can you help us understand that the

391
00:13:27,600 --> 00:13:28,800
accountants don't go

392
00:13:28,800 --> 00:13:31,120
sweet we'd be happy to help you with

393
00:13:31,120 --> 00:13:33,519
that but let's teach you about the gl

394
00:13:33,519 --> 00:13:37,680
first so the gl is debits and credits

395
00:13:37,680 --> 00:13:38,959
and what you're going to do on this

396
00:13:38,959 --> 00:13:41,199
that's not what they do right it's

397
00:13:41,199 --> 00:13:44,000
they provide tooling and information for

398
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:44,399
those

399
00:13:44,399 --> 00:13:46,320
exec teams to be able to make decisions

400
00:13:46,320 --> 00:13:48,079
quickly based on

401
00:13:48,079 --> 00:13:50,560
cooked in models huge giant spreadsheets

402
00:13:50,560 --> 00:13:51,760
or whatever

403
00:13:51,760 --> 00:13:54,639
modeling tool that they're using so that

404
00:13:54,639 --> 00:13:56,800
exact teams can plug in top line numbers

405
00:13:56,800 --> 00:13:57,760
bottom line numbers

406
00:13:57,760 --> 00:14:00,560
see what that flows through to be and

407
00:14:00,560 --> 00:14:03,199
they don't have to understand

408
00:14:03,199 --> 00:14:05,839
to the nth degree how accounting works

409
00:14:05,839 --> 00:14:06,480
how

410
00:14:06,480 --> 00:14:08,959
the gl is set up in that organization

411
00:14:08,959 --> 00:14:10,880
all the details of what the accountants

412
00:14:10,880 --> 00:14:12,079
are doing

413
00:14:12,079 --> 00:14:14,800
they can just quickly decide plug in

414
00:14:14,800 --> 00:14:15,519
information

415
00:14:15,519 --> 00:14:18,560
make decisions and we should do more of

416
00:14:18,560 --> 00:14:21,760
that as security teams we should provide

417
00:14:21,760 --> 00:14:24,160
the organization specifically when we're

418
00:14:24,160 --> 00:14:25,440
talking about appsec

419
00:14:25,440 --> 00:14:27,600
the engineering team with tools and

420
00:14:27,600 --> 00:14:29,920
information so they can make decisions

421
00:14:29,920 --> 00:14:32,399
so they can decide quickly and get on

422
00:14:32,399 --> 00:14:33,199
the

423
00:14:33,199 --> 00:14:35,120
get on the path of getting that product

424
00:14:35,120 --> 00:14:37,120
out into productions because it benefits

425
00:14:37,120 --> 00:14:38,079
the company in some

426
00:14:38,079 --> 00:14:42,160
form or fashion now there are good

427
00:14:42,160 --> 00:14:45,600
apsec tools out there absec dev tools uh

428
00:14:45,600 --> 00:14:47,600
kind of developer native tools that work

429
00:14:47,600 --> 00:14:49,279
the way that developers work

430
00:14:49,279 --> 00:14:51,120
in the context of how they work

431
00:14:51,120 --> 00:14:53,120
obviously sneak sponsor of

432
00:14:53,120 --> 00:14:56,880
all the talks uh fossa npm audit

433
00:14:56,880 --> 00:14:59,680
is a good one uh github and their new

434
00:14:59,680 --> 00:15:00,800
package inspection

435
00:15:00,800 --> 00:15:04,160
pr bot stuff and there's at least one

436
00:15:04,160 --> 00:15:05,279
more coming that

437
00:15:05,279 --> 00:15:08,959
has a logo that looks similar to this

438
00:15:09,040 --> 00:15:11,920
name stackhawk anyway those those tools

439
00:15:11,920 --> 00:15:12,160
are

440
00:15:12,160 --> 00:15:13,839
are gaining a lot of ground with

441
00:15:13,839 --> 00:15:15,279
developer communities because they

442
00:15:15,279 --> 00:15:17,839
enable them to make decisions quickly

443
00:15:17,839 --> 00:15:19,680
they enable them in the context of what

444
00:15:19,680 --> 00:15:21,360
they're doing to be able to go

445
00:15:21,360 --> 00:15:23,839
i understand that there's some risk or

446
00:15:23,839 --> 00:15:25,279
no risk or a lot of risk

447
00:15:25,279 --> 00:15:27,440
in the code base that i've got because

448
00:15:27,440 --> 00:15:30,240
these tools have informed me of my

449
00:15:30,240 --> 00:15:32,639
library vulnerabilities the package

450
00:15:32,639 --> 00:15:34,399
dependency tree that i have

451
00:15:34,399 --> 00:15:37,920
or the npm audit is

452
00:15:37,920 --> 00:15:40,480
is a good one npm audit fix is always a

453
00:15:40,480 --> 00:15:42,079
fun one to watch happen

454
00:15:42,079 --> 00:15:44,639
uh things tend to break there but you

455
00:15:44,639 --> 00:15:45,360
know it's it's

456
00:15:45,360 --> 00:15:47,360
those are good tools that are empowering

457
00:15:47,360 --> 00:15:49,199
developers to be able to say

458
00:15:49,199 --> 00:15:52,240
yes i can make decisions here in

459
00:15:52,240 --> 00:15:55,839
in the in my own timeline

460
00:15:57,920 --> 00:16:00,959
job roles we're just sort of misaligned

461
00:16:00,959 --> 00:16:05,279
uh as engineers and security teams

462
00:16:05,279 --> 00:16:07,920
when security teams approach their job

463
00:16:07,920 --> 00:16:10,160
excuse me

464
00:16:10,160 --> 00:16:12,880
they kind of come at it like hey my job

465
00:16:12,880 --> 00:16:13,680
specifically

466
00:16:13,680 --> 00:16:15,120
kind of app stack and infrastructure

467
00:16:15,120 --> 00:16:17,920
security teams my job is to break things

468
00:16:17,920 --> 00:16:22,000
and and understand why they broke and

469
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:24,560
and really get to the meat of how can

470
00:16:24,560 --> 00:16:26,000
someone leverage the

471
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:28,959
threat surface in my company to escalate

472
00:16:28,959 --> 00:16:30,720
and we look at it like this

473
00:16:30,720 --> 00:16:33,279
everything is broken and i've broken all

474
00:16:33,279 --> 00:16:34,959
the things i'm so happy about

475
00:16:34,959 --> 00:16:38,639
the super hard attacks that i made um

476
00:16:38,639 --> 00:16:41,040
and the super hard chaining of requests

477
00:16:41,040 --> 00:16:42,320
that i had to do

478
00:16:42,320 --> 00:16:45,279
and the interesting pivot i made inside

479
00:16:45,279 --> 00:16:46,320
the company from a

480
00:16:46,320 --> 00:16:48,720
from a vulnerability standpoint and

481
00:16:48,720 --> 00:16:50,079
that's great

482
00:16:50,079 --> 00:16:51,440
we really should be proud of those

483
00:16:51,440 --> 00:16:52,800
things because they're hard right

484
00:16:52,800 --> 00:16:53,839
they're hard as

485
00:16:53,839 --> 00:16:57,040
as an apsec pro to be able to go

486
00:16:57,040 --> 00:16:59,360
uh if i take this token from here and i

487
00:16:59,360 --> 00:17:00,959
pipe it through this other application

488
00:17:00,959 --> 00:17:02,720
and i can get myself into

489
00:17:02,720 --> 00:17:05,520
this third thing i can actually leverage

490
00:17:05,520 --> 00:17:06,240
some kind of

491
00:17:06,240 --> 00:17:09,760
um escalation

492
00:17:10,640 --> 00:17:12,880
but we approach the end part of that the

493
00:17:12,880 --> 00:17:14,000
wrong way we come

494
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:15,439
we come back to engineering go hey i

495
00:17:15,439 --> 00:17:17,280
broke the crap out of your thing isn't

496
00:17:17,280 --> 00:17:18,400
that awesome

497
00:17:18,400 --> 00:17:21,039
and no one thinks that's awesome no one

498
00:17:21,039 --> 00:17:22,640
thinks that the hard work that they put

499
00:17:22,640 --> 00:17:23,439
in

500
00:17:23,439 --> 00:17:27,439
uh needs to be demonized in the way that

501
00:17:27,439 --> 00:17:27,919
we

502
00:17:27,919 --> 00:17:30,240
we tend to do it because we're so proud

503
00:17:30,240 --> 00:17:32,799
of the thing that we did

504
00:17:32,799 --> 00:17:34,640
and and building that's another one of

505
00:17:34,640 --> 00:17:36,880
those bridge building functions where we

506
00:17:36,880 --> 00:17:37,600
can

507
00:17:37,600 --> 00:17:40,080
partner with engineering teams to say

508
00:17:40,080 --> 00:17:41,600
hey

509
00:17:41,600 --> 00:17:43,440
let's get together and talk about how

510
00:17:43,440 --> 00:17:46,000
this attack worked or how this

511
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:48,480
thing worked that i found with

512
00:17:48,480 --> 00:17:50,080
engineering and product because product

513
00:17:50,080 --> 00:17:51,600
is the one that's out there

514
00:17:51,600 --> 00:17:55,520
helping us prioritize this work

515
00:17:55,520 --> 00:17:58,799
um and so being able to being able to

516
00:17:58,799 --> 00:18:00,640
partner with engineering teams on stuff

517
00:18:00,640 --> 00:18:01,760
that we found

518
00:18:01,760 --> 00:18:04,799
is super important

519
00:18:05,039 --> 00:18:07,120
and then we talk about the apsec expense

520
00:18:07,120 --> 00:18:09,200
and and why it's really expensive to

521
00:18:09,200 --> 00:18:12,320
not only find and but fix stuff

522
00:18:12,320 --> 00:18:15,520
way out of this develop and deploy cycle

523
00:18:15,520 --> 00:18:18,640
so often we get into

524
00:18:18,640 --> 00:18:20,720
let's test an application after the

525
00:18:20,720 --> 00:18:23,440
deploy cycle the deploy

526
00:18:23,440 --> 00:18:26,160
piece of the cycle has happened so we've

527
00:18:26,160 --> 00:18:28,240
put something out into prod it's been

528
00:18:28,240 --> 00:18:30,000
one to six months or something like that

529
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:32,240
we're like hey we should test this thing

530
00:18:32,240 --> 00:18:34,720
um when did you deploy that okay so it's

531
00:18:34,720 --> 00:18:36,160
been out in the wild for

532
00:18:36,160 --> 00:18:38,160
three months four months five months six

533
00:18:38,160 --> 00:18:39,360
months

534
00:18:39,360 --> 00:18:42,559
two years whatever uh and so we find our

535
00:18:42,559 --> 00:18:44,080
cool things we break stuff and we're

536
00:18:44,080 --> 00:18:44,559
like

537
00:18:44,559 --> 00:18:47,200
sweet hey engineering here's a bunch of

538
00:18:47,200 --> 00:18:48,320
tickets

539
00:18:48,320 --> 00:18:51,360
um and so we try to

540
00:18:51,360 --> 00:18:53,360
jam that right back in the develop cycle

541
00:18:53,360 --> 00:18:54,720
and once again

542
00:18:54,720 --> 00:18:57,280
not talk to the product managers to tell

543
00:18:57,280 --> 00:18:59,039
them why it's important

544
00:18:59,039 --> 00:19:01,440
really talk about why that's a risk why

545
00:19:01,440 --> 00:19:02,640
it should be fixed

546
00:19:02,640 --> 00:19:06,160
or why it could wait um and so

547
00:19:06,160 --> 00:19:08,160
and we hope that engineers are just like

548
00:19:08,160 --> 00:19:09,679
okay i believe you

549
00:19:09,679 --> 00:19:11,120
and we'll go ahead and fix all this

550
00:19:11,120 --> 00:19:14,080
stuff and not ship features

551
00:19:14,080 --> 00:19:15,440
the other thing that's important there

552
00:19:15,440 --> 00:19:17,120
is we don't

553
00:19:17,120 --> 00:19:20,320
we sometimes don't take the context of

554
00:19:20,320 --> 00:19:20,960
the risk

555
00:19:20,960 --> 00:19:24,480
into account and we we think

556
00:19:24,480 --> 00:19:26,559
you know if this internal directory that

557
00:19:26,559 --> 00:19:27,919
we've built

558
00:19:27,919 --> 00:19:30,640
has a vulnerability in it then we should

559
00:19:30,640 --> 00:19:31,919
really focus on that

560
00:19:31,919 --> 00:19:34,640
and maybe you should if that's the only

561
00:19:34,640 --> 00:19:37,039
thing left in the entire organization

562
00:19:37,039 --> 00:19:40,080
and only then that's a maybe

563
00:19:40,080 --> 00:19:42,720
if your internal directory which by the

564
00:19:42,720 --> 00:19:44,320
way there's an external directory called

565
00:19:44,320 --> 00:19:45,200
linkedin

566
00:19:45,200 --> 00:19:48,000
has some vulnerabilities in it and

567
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:49,039
you've got

568
00:19:49,039 --> 00:19:51,039
the crown jewels you should definitely

569
00:19:51,039 --> 00:19:52,720
not be focused on the internal directory

570
00:19:52,720 --> 00:19:54,720
you should be focused on

571
00:19:54,720 --> 00:19:56,559
taking care of the main asset of the

572
00:19:56,559 --> 00:19:58,160
company the thing that makes the company

573
00:19:58,160 --> 00:19:58,640
work

574
00:19:58,640 --> 00:20:00,559
the thing that makes the company revenue

575
00:20:00,559 --> 00:20:01,760
you should be working on that

576
00:20:01,760 --> 00:20:05,919
definitely for sure and so often we

577
00:20:05,919 --> 00:20:07,520
struggle saying should i even have been

578
00:20:07,520 --> 00:20:09,200
testing this in the first place

579
00:20:09,200 --> 00:20:10,960
is this the right place to be spending

580
00:20:10,960 --> 00:20:12,880
my energy as an abstract professional or

581
00:20:12,880 --> 00:20:15,200
a security team

582
00:20:15,200 --> 00:20:17,200
and then we do that and then we do the

583
00:20:17,200 --> 00:20:18,480
anti-over

584
00:20:18,480 --> 00:20:21,440
game with engineering we file we take

585
00:20:21,440 --> 00:20:23,520
that big long appsec report that we get

586
00:20:23,520 --> 00:20:25,120
and we file tickets for all the things

587
00:20:25,120 --> 00:20:25,760
we say

588
00:20:25,760 --> 00:20:28,000
hey guys found a lot of cool stuff here

589
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:28,960
hit me up if you got

590
00:20:28,960 --> 00:20:31,120
any questions and then we hope that the

591
00:20:31,120 --> 00:20:32,320
engineers are like

592
00:20:32,320 --> 00:20:34,799
yes i totally want to know all about

593
00:20:34,799 --> 00:20:35,440
this stuff

594
00:20:35,440 --> 00:20:38,480
let me talk to those security people

595
00:20:38,480 --> 00:20:42,000
again no prioritization no importance

596
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:44,080
of why this thing is risky what the

597
00:20:44,080 --> 00:20:47,840
impact to the assets that it controls

598
00:20:47,840 --> 00:20:49,120
kinds of things that are happening in

599
00:20:49,120 --> 00:20:51,200
the organization

600
00:20:51,200 --> 00:20:55,760
again building silos between those teams

601
00:20:56,559 --> 00:21:00,559
lastly just say yes

602
00:21:01,440 --> 00:21:04,480
we like to we like to our security teams

603
00:21:04,480 --> 00:21:04,799
get

604
00:21:04,799 --> 00:21:06,559
branded as the department of no and

605
00:21:06,559 --> 00:21:09,120
that's because of how we approach

606
00:21:09,120 --> 00:21:11,200
partnership that's because of how we

607
00:21:11,200 --> 00:21:12,240
approach

608
00:21:12,240 --> 00:21:14,240
answering questions that engineers and

609
00:21:14,240 --> 00:21:15,360
accounting and i

610
00:21:15,360 --> 00:21:18,159
t and and all those teams have about

611
00:21:18,159 --> 00:21:20,880
problem solving

612
00:21:21,120 --> 00:21:23,200
uh i swear to you i built this deck

613
00:21:23,200 --> 00:21:24,400
before all the talks

614
00:21:24,400 --> 00:21:27,200
was a thing uh i hate this guy in this

615
00:21:27,200 --> 00:21:28,159
context

616
00:21:28,159 --> 00:21:30,400
i hate to fix all the things guy all the

617
00:21:30,400 --> 00:21:32,640
talks guy he's good i like him

618
00:21:32,640 --> 00:21:35,840
fix all the things guy i hate him being

619
00:21:35,840 --> 00:21:38,320
for us to say everything that we find

620
00:21:38,320 --> 00:21:39,280
should be fixed

621
00:21:39,280 --> 00:21:41,039
is just disingenuous we're not in the

622
00:21:41,039 --> 00:21:43,039
business of of

623
00:21:43,039 --> 00:21:46,159
um fixing patching

624
00:21:46,159 --> 00:21:47,520
we're in the business of providing a

625
00:21:47,520 --> 00:21:49,520
service to a customer and we should be

626
00:21:49,520 --> 00:21:51,679
prioritizing heavily

627
00:21:51,679 --> 00:21:52,960
the things that are really really

628
00:21:52,960 --> 00:21:54,880
important and understanding

629
00:21:54,880 --> 00:21:56,400
being able to understand in the context

630
00:21:56,400 --> 00:21:58,000
of the organization what are those

631
00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:01,280
things that are really really important

632
00:22:01,280 --> 00:22:04,880
so instead of the fix all the things guy

633
00:22:04,880 --> 00:22:06,080
which

634
00:22:06,080 --> 00:22:08,720
again i think he's i think he's the

635
00:22:08,720 --> 00:22:09,760
wrong

636
00:22:09,760 --> 00:22:11,919
thing for what we should do with things

637
00:22:11,919 --> 00:22:13,600
we find as security teams

638
00:22:13,600 --> 00:22:16,640
we should do the fix the right things be

639
00:22:16,640 --> 00:22:17,760
able to say

640
00:22:17,760 --> 00:22:19,760
hey this is something that we should fix

641
00:22:19,760 --> 00:22:20,960
because it's

642
00:22:20,960 --> 00:22:23,440
maybe it's low likelihood but it has

643
00:22:23,440 --> 00:22:24,480
impact on

644
00:22:24,480 --> 00:22:26,159
one of the most critical assets in the

645
00:22:26,159 --> 00:22:27,919
organization or the thing that we're

646
00:22:27,919 --> 00:22:28,880
going to use to

647
00:22:28,880 --> 00:22:32,559
to provide service to a customer

648
00:22:32,559 --> 00:22:35,919
and provide value it might not even be a

649
00:22:35,919 --> 00:22:36,480
critical

650
00:22:36,480 --> 00:22:39,520
or high or any of those things often so

651
00:22:39,520 --> 00:22:42,320
often we get into

652
00:22:42,320 --> 00:22:44,000
this thing says critical so we have to

653
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:45,360
fix it

654
00:22:45,360 --> 00:22:48,320
well it says critical sure but is it in

655
00:22:48,320 --> 00:22:49,039
the right

656
00:22:49,039 --> 00:22:50,400
does it affect the right things that we

657
00:22:50,400 --> 00:22:52,159
need to be talking about and should we

658
00:22:52,159 --> 00:22:53,280
be addressing

659
00:22:53,280 --> 00:22:55,280
some of the lows on the critical assets

660
00:22:55,280 --> 00:22:58,320
critical components of the system

661
00:22:58,320 --> 00:22:59,919
talking about those things and what that

662
00:22:59,919 --> 00:23:01,919
leads to is the chase

663
00:23:01,919 --> 00:23:05,440
to perfection we we find a ton of issues

664
00:23:05,440 --> 00:23:06,880
and then we say we have to fix all of

665
00:23:06,880 --> 00:23:08,240
these things and we

666
00:23:08,240 --> 00:23:11,360
and we chase the hundred percent

667
00:23:11,360 --> 00:23:13,600
but why what's the actual risk to the

668
00:23:13,600 --> 00:23:14,799
business

669
00:23:14,799 --> 00:23:18,880
um and i liken this to uh actually

670
00:23:18,880 --> 00:23:21,120
my product manager has likened this to

671
00:23:21,120 --> 00:23:22,080
what if your qa

672
00:23:22,080 --> 00:23:24,400
filed a thousand tickets for bugs that

673
00:23:24,400 --> 00:23:25,520
are unlikely to

674
00:23:25,520 --> 00:23:28,240
degrade user experience like they're

675
00:23:28,240 --> 00:23:29,840
technically doing their job right

676
00:23:29,840 --> 00:23:30,159
they're

677
00:23:30,159 --> 00:23:32,400
finding bugs but are they really

678
00:23:32,400 --> 00:23:33,840
providing value for

679
00:23:33,840 --> 00:23:36,480
the business and for the customer and

680
00:23:36,480 --> 00:23:37,679
probably not

681
00:23:37,679 --> 00:23:41,039
probably uh they're

682
00:23:41,039 --> 00:23:42,640
they're saying look at all the work that

683
00:23:42,640 --> 00:23:44,880
i've generated that's my value

684
00:23:44,880 --> 00:23:47,679
as opposed to look at how good we

685
00:23:47,679 --> 00:23:50,240
provided customer experience

686
00:23:50,240 --> 00:23:52,799
um look at how good we provided this

687
00:23:52,799 --> 00:23:53,279
product

688
00:23:53,279 --> 00:23:54,960
customer experience to the customers so

689
00:23:54,960 --> 00:23:56,640
they they love what we're doing

690
00:23:56,640 --> 00:23:57,760
and this is a little different because

691
00:23:57,760 --> 00:23:59,440
attackers think a different a little bit

692
00:23:59,440 --> 00:24:00,720
differently but

693
00:24:00,720 --> 00:24:02,640
i think this still holds a lot of water

694
00:24:02,640 --> 00:24:04,480
in how to

695
00:24:04,480 --> 00:24:06,240
think about what we're finding and what

696
00:24:06,240 --> 00:24:08,799
we're surfacing to the organization

697
00:24:08,799 --> 00:24:12,159
and my favorite quote here is from the

698
00:24:12,159 --> 00:24:13,520
product of ep that i talked

699
00:24:13,520 --> 00:24:16,640
to i never had a satisfying conversation

700
00:24:16,640 --> 00:24:18,080
on why a security issue is

701
00:24:18,080 --> 00:24:22,400
ever more important than a feature ever

702
00:24:22,400 --> 00:24:24,000
mostly that's because they didn't work

703
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:26,159
with me at the time

704
00:24:26,159 --> 00:24:28,320
i'm bad at this too but we forget that

705
00:24:28,320 --> 00:24:29,679
the product team needs to know this

706
00:24:29,679 --> 00:24:31,360
stuff too we're just like hey engineers

707
00:24:31,360 --> 00:24:33,840
fix things

708
00:24:34,640 --> 00:24:38,080
uh be a good improv partner so i love

709
00:24:38,080 --> 00:24:40,000
improv i love improv comedy

710
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:41,440
and one of the things they teach you in

711
00:24:41,440 --> 00:24:44,159
improv is when someone says something

712
00:24:44,159 --> 00:24:46,080
your next line should be yes and

713
00:24:46,080 --> 00:24:47,520
and that is something that we struggle

714
00:24:47,520 --> 00:24:50,159
with as security teams a ton

715
00:24:50,159 --> 00:24:51,600
an engineering team comes to us and goes

716
00:24:51,600 --> 00:24:53,760
hey we want to deploy some

717
00:24:53,760 --> 00:24:57,360
super new hotness in kubernetes or aws

718
00:24:57,360 --> 00:25:00,240
or gcp or something and we're like nah

719
00:25:00,240 --> 00:25:02,000
that's not a good idea

720
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:03,919
instead of nah that's not a good idea

721
00:25:03,919 --> 00:25:05,360
let's try yes

722
00:25:05,360 --> 00:25:07,120
and i would love to partner with you to

723
00:25:07,120 --> 00:25:08,799
understand that technology so we can do

724
00:25:08,799 --> 00:25:10,799
it safely

725
00:25:10,799 --> 00:25:14,400
hey we wanna we wanna run all kinds of

726
00:25:14,400 --> 00:25:16,559
linux laptops in the organization

727
00:25:16,559 --> 00:25:18,720
yeah sure cool let's work together so we

728
00:25:18,720 --> 00:25:19,840
can make that work and make it

729
00:25:19,840 --> 00:25:21,600
successful

730
00:25:21,600 --> 00:25:24,159
the business is there to take risks

731
00:25:24,159 --> 00:25:26,000
aside from security risk the business is

732
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:26,480
taking

733
00:25:26,480 --> 00:25:29,440
tons of risks all over the place and we

734
00:25:29,440 --> 00:25:30,559
need to get into the

735
00:25:30,559 --> 00:25:33,360
habit of going we should be taking risks

736
00:25:33,360 --> 00:25:35,679
what are the right risks to take

737
00:25:35,679 --> 00:25:37,360
and how can everyone know that those are

738
00:25:37,360 --> 00:25:39,039
the right risks to take

739
00:25:39,039 --> 00:25:41,440
so again being able to provide that

740
00:25:41,440 --> 00:25:44,799
information back to everyone

741
00:25:45,120 --> 00:25:47,440
closing closing thoughts here uh and

742
00:25:47,440 --> 00:25:48,960
getting to q a

743
00:25:48,960 --> 00:25:50,480
democratize security through the

744
00:25:50,480 --> 00:25:52,240
organization uh with

745
00:25:52,240 --> 00:25:54,799
easy-to-use tools and information so

746
00:25:54,799 --> 00:25:56,559
being able to consume that quickly and

747
00:25:56,559 --> 00:25:58,080
easily to be able to know that you're

748
00:25:58,080 --> 00:25:58,960
making

749
00:25:58,960 --> 00:26:01,200
sane decisions what things you should be

750
00:26:01,200 --> 00:26:03,120
doing what things you

751
00:26:03,120 --> 00:26:05,200
should do alternate ways if they're not

752
00:26:05,200 --> 00:26:07,360
the safest way

753
00:26:07,360 --> 00:26:10,159
i don't particularly like when people

754
00:26:10,159 --> 00:26:11,440
say security is everyone's

755
00:26:11,440 --> 00:26:12,880
responsibility

756
00:26:12,880 --> 00:26:15,760
uh it feels like security teams struggle

757
00:26:15,760 --> 00:26:17,279
with we can't get everything done so

758
00:26:17,279 --> 00:26:18,720
everyone has to help us

759
00:26:18,720 --> 00:26:20,720
and that's just not how it really works

760
00:26:20,720 --> 00:26:21,840
um

761
00:26:21,840 --> 00:26:24,880
accounting is not everyone's job pieces

762
00:26:24,880 --> 00:26:26,720
of accounting are everyone's job turn in

763
00:26:26,720 --> 00:26:28,480
your expense reports but accounting is

764
00:26:28,480 --> 00:26:29,679
the responsibility of the accounting

765
00:26:29,679 --> 00:26:30,720
department

766
00:26:30,720 --> 00:26:33,200
uh janitor everyone is not responsible

767
00:26:33,200 --> 00:26:34,400
for cleaning the

768
00:26:34,400 --> 00:26:36,559
restrooms at a company janitors are

769
00:26:36,559 --> 00:26:37,440
responsible

770
00:26:37,440 --> 00:26:39,120
we are responsible for picking up our

771
00:26:39,120 --> 00:26:41,440
little pieces of trash so

772
00:26:41,440 --> 00:26:42,640
saying security is everyone's

773
00:26:42,640 --> 00:26:44,480
responsibility is probably

774
00:26:44,480 --> 00:26:47,760
just way too broad generally um

775
00:26:47,760 --> 00:26:49,440
and we don't do a good job of informing

776
00:26:49,440 --> 00:26:51,840
what that means uh security equals

777
00:26:51,840 --> 00:26:53,279
quality

778
00:26:53,279 --> 00:26:54,960
engineers really care about the code

779
00:26:54,960 --> 00:26:56,799
that they write they really do

780
00:26:56,799 --> 00:26:58,799
uh and it's it's becoming more and more

781
00:26:58,799 --> 00:27:00,559
obvious that they care about

782
00:27:00,559 --> 00:27:02,880
performance and quality and and

783
00:27:02,880 --> 00:27:05,039
reliability

784
00:27:05,039 --> 00:27:07,520
and being able to give them tools so

785
00:27:07,520 --> 00:27:09,200
that they can know security

786
00:27:09,200 --> 00:27:10,720
and make decisions on it is super

787
00:27:10,720 --> 00:27:13,279
important uh just say no to your inner

788
00:27:13,279 --> 00:27:14,799
if anything is wrong at all

789
00:27:14,799 --> 00:27:17,279
it's all wrong uh that that inner

790
00:27:17,279 --> 00:27:18,159
security guy

791
00:27:18,159 --> 00:27:19,679
that our inner security thing that

792
00:27:19,679 --> 00:27:21,279
happens where you're like

793
00:27:21,279 --> 00:27:23,440
uh we've got almost all of this stuff

794
00:27:23,440 --> 00:27:25,200
taken care of but there's this one thing

795
00:27:25,200 --> 00:27:26,720
and it's going to root sync the whole

796
00:27:26,720 --> 00:27:27,520
company

797
00:27:27,520 --> 00:27:30,799
just say no to that inner voice and then

798
00:27:30,799 --> 00:27:33,840
support your dev teams go buy them some

799
00:27:33,840 --> 00:27:35,360
tacos go sit in their

800
00:27:35,360 --> 00:27:37,200
stand-ups go sit in their scrums when

801
00:27:37,200 --> 00:27:38,399
they're talking about

802
00:27:38,399 --> 00:27:41,840
things just listen listen listen listen

803
00:27:41,840 --> 00:27:43,679
understand what their what their

804
00:27:43,679 --> 00:27:45,039
features they're trying to roll out what

805
00:27:45,039 --> 00:27:46,559
bugs they're trying to fix what problems

806
00:27:46,559 --> 00:27:48,559
they're trying to solve listen listen

807
00:27:48,559 --> 00:27:50,320
listen and then come back and say hey

808
00:27:50,320 --> 00:27:52,159
i'd like to help you with this thing

809
00:27:52,159 --> 00:27:53,919
that i've heard you guys heard you talk

810
00:27:53,919 --> 00:27:55,679
about over and over and over again

811
00:27:55,679 --> 00:27:57,840
because i think it's related to security

812
00:27:57,840 --> 00:28:00,000
buying some tacos one of my favorite

813
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:01,600
uh one of my favorite people that i

814
00:28:01,600 --> 00:28:03,200
talked to he used to

815
00:28:03,200 --> 00:28:05,440
he used to hand out tacos for good deeds

816
00:28:05,440 --> 00:28:07,919
and it was really great

817
00:28:07,919 --> 00:28:12,159
um lastly some useful links for

818
00:28:12,159 --> 00:28:15,120
everybody out there uh that first one is

819
00:28:15,120 --> 00:28:17,360
a shameless plug and not even shameless

820
00:28:17,360 --> 00:28:20,559
we think the dynamic code analysis tool

821
00:28:20,559 --> 00:28:22,960
that a dev can use is super important

822
00:28:22,960 --> 00:28:24,960
uh there's a secure code example here

823
00:28:24,960 --> 00:28:26,880
for anybody who's looking for

824
00:28:26,880 --> 00:28:28,880
an example of what super secure code

825
00:28:28,880 --> 00:28:31,039
looks like and then obviously some links

826
00:28:31,039 --> 00:28:33,600
to those library analysis tools

827
00:28:33,600 --> 00:28:37,360
npm audit sneak fossa etc

828
00:28:37,360 --> 00:28:39,520
that's all the time i have for today

829
00:28:39,520 --> 00:28:41,039
i'll be hanging out in slack and there's

830
00:28:41,039 --> 00:28:42,480
my twitter handle if you want to talk to

831
00:28:42,480 --> 00:28:43,360
me later

832
00:28:43,360 --> 00:28:45,120
uh i know there's some people in slack

833
00:28:45,120 --> 00:28:46,399
chatting already

834
00:28:46,399 --> 00:28:49,919
and alyssa's back to outro me

835
00:28:49,919 --> 00:28:52,480
yep um so excellent thank you for

836
00:28:52,480 --> 00:28:53,039
sharing

837
00:28:53,039 --> 00:28:55,279
uh the only question we had i'll let you

838
00:28:55,279 --> 00:28:57,200
address it in slack later because

839
00:28:57,200 --> 00:28:58,960
we're up against time here but uh

840
00:28:58,960 --> 00:29:01,520
someone wants to know why tacos

841
00:29:01,520 --> 00:29:04,000
i mean because tacos it seems like a

842
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:05,120
pretty easy answer

843
00:29:05,120 --> 00:29:07,679
um yes the talks are recorded uh those

844
00:29:07,679 --> 00:29:08,799
registered will get
