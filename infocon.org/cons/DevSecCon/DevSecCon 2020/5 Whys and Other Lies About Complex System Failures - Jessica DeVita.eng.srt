00:00:07,529 --> 00:00:09,210
guys to move over to the Q&A section as

5
00:00:09,210 --> 00:00:12,450
well so get your questions ready but

6
00:00:12,450 --> 00:00:14,849
with that being said I'm just going to

7
00:00:14,849 --> 00:00:16,260
hand it over to Jessica and let her take

8
00:00:16,260 --> 00:00:21,720
it away well hi thank you so much Jeff I

let me know if you can there we go well

12
00:00:33,690 --> 00:00:36,690
so hello there I'm so excited about this

13
00:00:36,690 --> 00:00:39,059
conference and just so appreciate

14
00:00:39,059 --> 00:00:41,700
Patrick and Jeff and all of the

15
00:00:41,700 --> 00:00:44,399
wonderful folks working together to make

16
00:00:44,399 --> 00:00:47,430
this conference happen I wanted to ask

17
00:00:47,430 --> 00:00:50,340
if all of you if you feel so moved if

18
00:00:50,340 --> 00:00:53,550
you are able to donate to this wonderful

19
00:00:53,550 --> 00:00:55,739
cause all of the funds are going to help

20
00:00:55,739 --> 00:00:59,129
various charities to focus on helping

21
00:00:59,129 --> 00:01:01,920
the köppen night team victims and I know

22
00:01:01,920 --> 00:01:04,530
that this number is probably very out of

23
00:01:04,530 --> 00:01:06,000
date but I know that we've already

24
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:10,170
raised at the time I took this note was

25
00:01:10,170 --> 00:01:11,729
seventy thousand dollars there's a

26
00:01:11,729 --> 00:01:13,439
number of folks that are matching your

27
00:01:13,439 --> 00:01:17,070
donations so I would just ask if you are

28
00:01:17,070 --> 00:01:19,560
able and if you feel so moved to please

29
00:01:19,560 --> 00:01:21,689
go ahead and donate there's a link on

30
00:01:21,689 --> 00:01:26,310
the screen uh I hope that this talk will

31
00:01:26,310 --> 00:01:29,310
spark some interesting conversations for

32
00:01:29,310 --> 00:01:32,340
you going forward the talk is never

33
00:01:32,340 --> 00:01:34,740
about me it's never about the speaker

34
00:01:34,740 --> 00:01:37,070
it's about you and what happens for you

35
00:01:37,070 --> 00:01:39,840
after and what happens for you tomorrow

36
00:01:39,840 --> 00:01:42,299
so that's my goal for today is that this

37
00:01:42,299 --> 00:01:44,189
would spark some very interesting

38
00:01:44,189 --> 00:01:48,570
conversations for you the bottom line up

39
00:01:48,570 --> 00:01:51,689
front is that people I care about are

40
00:01:51,689 --> 00:01:54,299
suffering from the lie that the five

41
00:01:54,299 --> 00:01:56,700
whys are appropriate for complex systems

42
00:01:56,700 --> 00:01:59,909
failures and analysis of these types of

43
00:01:59,909 --> 00:02:02,610
failures and I'm hoping to debunk some

44
00:02:02,610 --> 00:02:06,030
of those myths and help you think about

45
00:02:06,030 --> 00:02:11,670
some better ways to move forward so I

46
00:02:11,670 --> 00:02:13,890
generally like to avoid blame

47
00:02:13,890 --> 00:02:16,430
in this case I do think that Eric Ries

48
00:02:16,430 --> 00:02:20,640
bears a lot of the burden of sort of

49
00:02:20,640 --> 00:02:22,710
promoting and propagating the five wives

50
00:02:22,710 --> 00:02:25,350
and it's super frustrating so Eric this

51
00:02:25,350 --> 00:02:30,990
talk is for you this article a medium is

52
00:02:30,990 --> 00:02:33,840
just one example of the countless

53
00:02:33,840 --> 00:02:36,630
articles that are peddling this approach

54
00:02:36,630 --> 00:02:39,620
to finding the root cause of a problem

55
00:02:39,620 --> 00:02:43,190
and this this are you know this article

56
00:02:43,190 --> 00:02:46,140
proposes that there's just some very

57
00:02:46,140 --> 00:02:50,190
simple steps and they say you know ask

58
00:02:50,190 --> 00:02:52,770
why the problem happens and write down

59
00:02:52,770 --> 00:02:55,590
the answer to their problem and if the

60
00:02:55,590 --> 00:02:57,720
answer you just provided doesn't

61
00:02:57,720 --> 00:03:00,270
identify the root cause that you wrote

62
00:03:00,270 --> 00:03:02,670
down and step one well maybe you should

63
00:03:02,670 --> 00:03:05,690
ask why again and write that answer down

64
00:03:05,690 --> 00:03:08,130
they hopefully warned that in the

65
00:03:08,130 --> 00:03:10,110
beginning you usually won't find the

66
00:03:10,110 --> 00:03:12,090
root cause of the problem

67
00:03:12,090 --> 00:03:13,709
so they encourage you to loop back to

68
00:03:13,709 --> 00:03:17,340
step three until the team agrees that

69
00:03:17,340 --> 00:03:20,430
the probable cause of the problem has

70
00:03:20,430 --> 00:03:25,650
been identified now if you listen to

71
00:03:25,650 --> 00:03:27,150
advice from random people on the

72
00:03:27,150 --> 00:03:30,660
internet you're gonna have a bad time so

73
00:03:30,660 --> 00:03:33,800
let's take a step back away from these

74
00:03:33,800 --> 00:03:36,630
simplified methods and explore what's

75
00:03:36,630 --> 00:03:39,810
really going on here but wait a second

76
00:03:39,810 --> 00:03:42,690
there's a template in Excel surely it's

77
00:03:42,690 --> 00:03:46,290
got to have some legitimacy for us look

78
00:03:46,290 --> 00:03:48,660
it's right under the improvement tools

79
00:03:48,660 --> 00:03:52,170
drop down and and it looks like you can

80
00:03:52,170 --> 00:03:54,420
have the three-legged five why's what is

81
00:03:54,420 --> 00:03:59,850
that I gotta find out but the basis of

82
00:03:59,850 --> 00:04:03,000
the five why's comes from the Toyota

83
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:05,760
Production system and again this

84
00:04:05,760 --> 00:04:08,130
simplified method this talks about by

85
00:04:08,130 --> 00:04:10,470
repeating these questions the question

86
00:04:10,470 --> 00:04:13,470
why just five times not seven not twelve

87
00:04:13,470 --> 00:04:17,130
but five the nature of the problem and

88
00:04:17,130 --> 00:04:19,048
it's solution is just going to become

89
00:04:19,048 --> 00:04:20,700
clearer

90
00:04:20,700 --> 00:04:25,020
thus five the solution is one H and so

91
00:04:25,020 --> 00:04:28,830
five wise equals one-half

92
00:04:28,830 --> 00:04:34,150
well isn't that convenient so convenient

93
00:04:34,150 --> 00:04:39,069
right I think that that starts to to get

94
00:04:39,069 --> 00:04:42,629
to that problem is that this is a very

95
00:04:42,629 --> 00:04:47,229
seductive lie we've been sold and human

96
00:04:47,229 --> 00:04:49,150
factors and system safety and safety

97
00:04:49,150 --> 00:04:52,659
scientists have reasonably rejected this

98
00:04:52,659 --> 00:04:56,490
approach but it is so seductive

99
00:04:56,490 --> 00:05:00,669
leadership is so looking for something

100
00:05:00,669 --> 00:05:04,060
simple they want an answer that that

101
00:05:04,060 --> 00:05:07,389
will somehow soothe this you know issues

102
00:05:07,389 --> 00:05:09,699
that we feel inside when there has been

103
00:05:09,699 --> 00:05:13,449
an incident or an outage but this

104
00:05:13,449 --> 00:05:17,650
seductive trap is just that a trap and

105
00:05:17,650 --> 00:05:20,849
it's not going to lead to a happy place

106
00:05:20,849 --> 00:05:23,590
so let's talk about the traps and what

107
00:05:23,590 --> 00:05:25,629
what problems you're going to run into

108
00:05:25,629 --> 00:05:29,530
and I think the first most important one

109
00:05:29,530 --> 00:05:33,130
is that these can lead to attribution

110
00:05:33,130 --> 00:05:36,360
the attribution of to human error and

111
00:05:36,360 --> 00:05:40,979
and human error is just another lie that

112
00:05:40,979 --> 00:05:44,110
we've been told about about complex

113
00:05:44,110 --> 00:05:48,460
systems failures it is a lie we can look

114
00:05:48,460 --> 00:05:50,710
to David dr. David woods and Richard

115
00:05:50,710 --> 00:05:53,080
cook they have a great paper called

116
00:05:53,080 --> 00:05:55,930
perspectives on human error hindsight

117
00:05:55,930 --> 00:05:58,479
biases and local rationality which I'll

118
00:05:58,479 --> 00:06:02,590
tell you a little bit more about five

119
00:06:02,590 --> 00:06:06,789
wise and RCA don't require psychological

120
00:06:06,789 --> 00:06:09,849
safety this is a quote from I repeat I

121
00:06:09,849 --> 00:06:10,360
repeat

122
00:06:10,360 --> 00:06:14,050
double-o eight on Twitter you can deploy

123
00:06:14,050 --> 00:06:16,150
them at any time and anywhere without

124
00:06:16,150 --> 00:06:19,870
any preparation on any vulnerable soul

125
00:06:19,870 --> 00:06:22,389
you can do it with people who trust you

126
00:06:22,389 --> 00:06:23,919
or who don't

127
00:06:23,919 --> 00:06:26,050
it's more of an exploit than it is

128
00:06:26,050 --> 00:06:29,259
anything to do with learning and that I

129
00:06:29,259 --> 00:06:33,789
thought was so perfectly describes the

130
00:06:33,789 --> 00:06:38,740
problem you see the five why's Richard

131
00:06:38,740 --> 00:06:40,810
tenets on Twitter says it's

132
00:06:40,810 --> 00:06:43,540
all about asking why until you get an

133
00:06:43,540 --> 00:06:46,450
answer that you like and it's ideally

134
00:06:46,450 --> 00:06:49,150
one that shifts the blame to someone who

135
00:06:49,150 --> 00:06:53,169
cannot defend themself and or is very

136
00:06:53,169 --> 00:06:58,530
cheap to remediate trap number two

137
00:06:58,530 --> 00:07:01,419
counterfactual reasoning now you may

138
00:07:01,419 --> 00:07:03,070
have heard that term or not but I

139
00:07:03,070 --> 00:07:05,889
guarantee you that you know when it is

140
00:07:05,889 --> 00:07:09,820
at play whenever you hear and you will

141
00:07:09,820 --> 00:07:12,190
hear this if you are participating in

142
00:07:12,190 --> 00:07:14,800
any type of five wise exercise as you

143
00:07:14,800 --> 00:07:17,470
will hear the word should have could

144
00:07:17,470 --> 00:07:22,800
have would have failed too did not

145
00:07:22,800 --> 00:07:25,479
that's counterfactual reasoning and

146
00:07:25,479 --> 00:07:27,130
you're describing an incident that

147
00:07:27,130 --> 00:07:29,919
didn't happen as some sort of way of

148
00:07:29,919 --> 00:07:34,650
explaining what did happen it's crazy

149
00:07:34,740 --> 00:07:37,780
trap number three is the use of

150
00:07:37,780 --> 00:07:41,610
normative language normative language is

151
00:07:41,610 --> 00:07:45,430
uh you might hear people describing well

152
00:07:45,430 --> 00:07:47,740
they did something carelessly or hastily

153
00:07:47,740 --> 00:07:49,750
or inadequately

154
00:07:49,750 --> 00:07:53,289
and the problem with normative language

155
00:07:53,289 --> 00:07:56,410
is that it's the you're judging outcomes

156
00:07:56,410 --> 00:07:58,630
based on a one piece of information that

157
00:07:58,630 --> 00:08:01,690
was unavailable to the humans involved

158
00:08:01,690 --> 00:08:03,990
at the time they made their decisions

159
00:08:03,990 --> 00:08:07,150
and to be clear like normative language

160
00:08:07,150 --> 00:08:09,220
can also be used in the opposite

161
00:08:09,220 --> 00:08:11,800
opposite sense people might praise

162
00:08:11,800 --> 00:08:13,900
operators for acting having acted

163
00:08:13,900 --> 00:08:17,410
appropriately for example this judgement

164
00:08:17,410 --> 00:08:19,210
again is made with the benefit of

165
00:08:19,210 --> 00:08:21,280
hindsight and it's made with the benefit

166
00:08:21,280 --> 00:08:22,900
of information that the people in the

167
00:08:22,900 --> 00:08:28,630
question did not have mark Johnson says

168
00:08:28,630 --> 00:08:30,520
that the five wise and the problem with

169
00:08:30,520 --> 00:08:33,339
root cause analysis is that whose five

170
00:08:33,339 --> 00:08:36,610
whys will take precedent we know that in

171
00:08:36,610 --> 00:08:39,429
a blame culture higher type of

172
00:08:39,429 --> 00:08:42,250
environment the probably whoever's got

173
00:08:42,250 --> 00:08:45,070
the power is going to they're there five

174
00:08:45,070 --> 00:08:47,860
wise will take precedent that is not

175
00:08:47,860 --> 00:08:50,850
learning

176
00:08:51,250 --> 00:08:54,070
my favorite trap that you'll fall into

177
00:08:54,070 --> 00:08:56,230
with the five wisest mechanistic

178
00:08:56,230 --> 00:08:58,810
reasoning this mechanistic reasoning

179
00:08:58,810 --> 00:09:00,760
says that our system would have been

180
00:09:00,760 --> 00:09:02,950
just fine if it hadn't been for those

181
00:09:02,950 --> 00:09:08,080
meddling and kids this is built on this

182
00:09:08,080 --> 00:09:10,590
idea that we work in systems that are

183
00:09:10,590 --> 00:09:12,730
basically great they're working just

184
00:09:12,730 --> 00:09:16,240
fine and that failure can be explained

185
00:09:16,240 --> 00:09:18,400
by a component with the system that

186
00:09:18,400 --> 00:09:21,580
wasn't functioning as expected and if

187
00:09:21,580 --> 00:09:23,470
only those meddling kids had gone and

188
00:09:23,470 --> 00:09:25,480
deployed that broken configuration

189
00:09:25,480 --> 00:09:29,830
everything would have been just fine now

190
00:09:29,830 --> 00:09:33,250
the problem here that I probably don't

191
00:09:33,250 --> 00:09:35,560
need to tell you but that this is simply

192
00:09:35,560 --> 00:09:38,440
not how our systems work it's just not

193
00:09:38,440 --> 00:09:39,820
it

194
00:09:39,820 --> 00:09:42,700
you know this leads us down a path where

195
00:09:42,700 --> 00:09:44,680
we think that finding the faulty human

196
00:09:44,680 --> 00:09:46,930
we're back to the human error issue is

197
00:09:46,930 --> 00:09:49,420
equivalent to finding the problem but

198
00:09:49,420 --> 00:09:52,090
you know that same faulty human has been

199
00:09:52,090 --> 00:09:54,970
improvising and adapting to keep the

200
00:09:54,970 --> 00:09:57,370
system running for weeks and months and

201
00:09:57,370 --> 00:10:00,070
Sue I'll spot spoke to this in her

202
00:10:00,070 --> 00:10:01,690
earlier talk hopefully you'll get a

203
00:10:01,690 --> 00:10:04,270
chance to watch that when the recordings

204
00:10:04,270 --> 00:10:07,030
come out she talks about working to rule

205
00:10:07,030 --> 00:10:08,950
where you're following the steps

206
00:10:08,950 --> 00:10:13,560
precisely but we know that that is not

207
00:10:13,560 --> 00:10:14,890
safe

208
00:10:14,890 --> 00:10:18,040
we know that human humans adapting to

209
00:10:18,040 --> 00:10:20,170
keep the systems running is what saves

210
00:10:20,170 --> 00:10:23,710
our bacon every time so I think there's

211
00:10:23,710 --> 00:10:27,400
probably more to look at here Allen card

212
00:10:27,400 --> 00:10:29,320
has a wonderful article called the

213
00:10:29,320 --> 00:10:32,230
problem with the five whys and he pulls

214
00:10:32,230 --> 00:10:35,260
no punches and says the real problem

215
00:10:35,260 --> 00:10:38,130
with the five whys is that it so grossly

216
00:10:38,130 --> 00:10:40,720
oversimplified the process of problem

217
00:10:40,720 --> 00:10:46,470
exploration it should not be used at all

218
00:10:46,890 --> 00:10:49,020
dr. Bob Lear's

219
00:10:49,020 --> 00:10:52,720
who is no longer with us and dr.

220
00:10:52,720 --> 00:10:54,580
Christopher Christopher Nemeth have a

221
00:10:54,580 --> 00:10:57,339
terrific article called replacing

222
00:10:57,339 --> 00:10:59,200
hindsight with insight and I encourage

223
00:10:59,200 --> 00:11:01,850
you to check out the link

224
00:11:01,850 --> 00:11:04,190
it's a very very good paper it's very

225
00:11:04,190 --> 00:11:07,089
easy to read they talk about this

226
00:11:07,089 --> 00:11:10,639
delusional clarity and that hindsight is

227
00:11:10,639 --> 00:11:14,029
is you know powerful to help us organize

228
00:11:14,029 --> 00:11:18,319
and put structure and impose our this

229
00:11:18,319 --> 00:11:21,589
kind of structure on past events they

230
00:11:21,589 --> 00:11:24,680
they talk about converting confusing and

231
00:11:24,680 --> 00:11:27,170
complex histories and to meet linear

232
00:11:27,170 --> 00:11:29,810
more certain and less ambiguous

233
00:11:29,810 --> 00:11:32,930
narratives that provide a sort of

234
00:11:32,930 --> 00:11:37,490
delusional clarity terrific article

235
00:11:37,490 --> 00:11:39,319
please take a look at it

236
00:11:39,319 --> 00:11:44,019
and again the problem is is that these

237
00:11:44,019 --> 00:11:47,569
techniques do not apply to the systems

238
00:11:47,569 --> 00:11:50,300
you work in maybe this applies if you're

239
00:11:50,300 --> 00:11:52,730
trying to figure out why your your new

240
00:11:52,730 --> 00:11:55,490
sourdough recipe for bread didn't work

241
00:11:55,490 --> 00:11:58,069
out but you're not making bread here

242
00:11:58,069 --> 00:12:01,269
where we're making systems that humans

243
00:12:01,269 --> 00:12:04,940
rely on and need to rely on and they're

244
00:12:04,940 --> 00:12:08,509
messy make no mistake about it John also

245
00:12:08,509 --> 00:12:12,759
talks about this these systemic causes

246
00:12:12,759 --> 00:12:16,910
factors that you know your five why's is

247
00:12:16,910 --> 00:12:19,220
never gonna give you these answers but

248
00:12:19,220 --> 00:12:20,870
if you really dig in you're gonna

249
00:12:20,870 --> 00:12:26,000
discover a whole messy system that is

250
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:28,850
just it just can't be covered by these

251
00:12:28,850 --> 00:12:34,579
five whys I would be remiss if I did not

252
00:12:34,579 --> 00:12:37,910
make sure that you know about dr.

253
00:12:37,910 --> 00:12:40,730
Richard crook who has a fabulous paper

254
00:12:40,730 --> 00:12:44,509
called how complex systems fail and I

255
00:12:44,509 --> 00:12:46,250
think it's required reading for anyone

256
00:12:46,250 --> 00:12:50,540
working in in DevOps or you know any

257
00:12:50,540 --> 00:12:53,149
type of web operations tooling

258
00:12:53,149 --> 00:12:56,689
leadership should read this I when we

259
00:12:56,689 --> 00:12:59,240
get back out back to normal whatever

260
00:12:59,240 --> 00:13:02,779
that is the next talk I gave I I'm

261
00:13:02,779 --> 00:13:04,579
waiting for the talk that I can go and

262
00:13:04,579 --> 00:13:06,410
like put this under everybody's chairs

263
00:13:06,410 --> 00:13:09,380
and you can discover it because I think

264
00:13:09,380 --> 00:13:12,709
it's that important but he describes a

265
00:13:12,709 --> 00:13:15,279
number of X of

266
00:13:15,279 --> 00:13:18,380
nuance is about how complex systems fail

267
00:13:18,380 --> 00:13:20,870
and I just really encourage you to take

268
00:13:20,870 --> 00:13:24,440
a look at that but let's go for more

269
00:13:24,440 --> 00:13:27,260
science we have dr. Nancy Leveson and

270
00:13:27,260 --> 00:13:30,710
she is from MIT she has a terrific paper

271
00:13:30,710 --> 00:13:34,490
also very easy to digest and read and

272
00:13:34,490 --> 00:13:36,589
it's applying systems-thinking to

273
00:13:36,589 --> 00:13:39,440
analyze and learn from events now I'm

274
00:13:39,440 --> 00:13:42,560
just gonna pull a couple of points out

275
00:13:42,560 --> 00:13:44,230
of her paper

276
00:13:44,230 --> 00:13:47,930
she says again pulling no punches that

277
00:13:47,930 --> 00:13:49,690
five why's is perhaps the most

278
00:13:49,690 --> 00:13:52,850
simplistic and it leads to the least

279
00:13:52,850 --> 00:13:57,710
amount of learning from events she

280
00:13:57,710 --> 00:14:00,230
describes a big issue is that the

281
00:14:00,230 --> 00:14:03,320
results are not reproducible you can go

282
00:14:03,320 --> 00:14:05,270
into one room and do five whys and you

283
00:14:05,270 --> 00:14:07,160
can be and your colleague can go into

284
00:14:07,160 --> 00:14:08,870
another and you will never come up with

285
00:14:08,870 --> 00:14:13,089
the same answers because again the

286
00:14:13,089 --> 00:14:15,860
results are not reproducible it's it's

287
00:14:15,860 --> 00:14:19,160
really problematic and people will come

288
00:14:19,160 --> 00:14:20,540
up with these different solutions for

289
00:14:20,540 --> 00:14:26,630
the same problem and finally this is

290
00:14:26,630 --> 00:14:28,310
again the article is really worth

291
00:14:28,310 --> 00:14:31,040
reading in its entirety but a single

292
00:14:31,040 --> 00:14:33,650
root cause is assumed along with one

293
00:14:33,650 --> 00:14:36,430
neat linear path to this to the event

294
00:14:36,430 --> 00:14:40,070
and we have heard time and time again

295
00:14:40,070 --> 00:14:43,310
from Jay Paul read from John all spa

296
00:14:43,310 --> 00:14:46,520
from numerous practitioners in the field

297
00:14:46,520 --> 00:14:50,480
that this is just just it's it's wrong

298
00:14:50,480 --> 00:14:52,750
it's not going to help you in any way

299
00:14:52,750 --> 00:14:58,400
that's just not how events unfold it is

300
00:14:58,400 --> 00:15:01,850
this act of separating important or

301
00:15:01,850 --> 00:15:05,180
contributory events from unimportant

302
00:15:05,180 --> 00:15:08,870
ones by a few key decision-makers and it

303
00:15:08,870 --> 00:15:11,540
is then to quote Sidney Dekker an act of

304
00:15:11,540 --> 00:15:14,420
construction it is the creation of a

305
00:15:14,420 --> 00:15:19,070
story we we do not find cause we

306
00:15:19,070 --> 00:15:22,370
construct it it is not the construction

307
00:15:22,370 --> 00:15:24,050
reconstruction of a story that is just

308
00:15:24,050 --> 00:15:26,120
sitting there waiting for you to uncover

309
00:15:26,120 --> 00:15:28,640
it you're making it up

310
00:15:28,640 --> 00:15:31,310
it is not objective it is completely

311
00:15:31,310 --> 00:15:33,800
subjective to what you choose to include

312
00:15:33,800 --> 00:15:40,220
and not include from John's mouth to

313
00:15:40,220 --> 00:15:44,690
your ears why is the wrong question he

314
00:15:44,690 --> 00:15:47,649
has a terrific article which I think

315
00:15:47,649 --> 00:15:51,380
Matt spoke to earlier the infinite house

316
00:15:51,380 --> 00:15:54,970
and he talks about how asking how

317
00:15:54,970 --> 00:15:58,579
actually will help you get people to

318
00:15:58,579 --> 00:16:01,070
describe some at least some of the

319
00:16:01,070 --> 00:16:03,230
conditions that allow an event to take

320
00:16:03,230 --> 00:16:04,970
place and will give you a lot more rich

321
00:16:04,970 --> 00:16:07,579
operational data about how how things

322
00:16:07,579 --> 00:16:08,720
really work and how they can really

323
00:16:08,720 --> 00:16:12,170
break so definitely take a look at this

324
00:16:12,170 --> 00:16:16,399
article I think it just very very

325
00:16:16,399 --> 00:16:21,410
detailed explanations about the problems

326
00:16:21,410 --> 00:16:26,420
with the questions why my answer is that

327
00:16:26,420 --> 00:16:30,230
five whys only have the same five

328
00:16:30,230 --> 00:16:32,450
answers and it's because local

329
00:16:32,450 --> 00:16:35,779
rationality so I replied to my colleague

330
00:16:35,779 --> 00:16:37,339
and extent my former colleague from

331
00:16:37,339 --> 00:16:40,370
Microsoft extending wonderful human

332
00:16:40,370 --> 00:16:43,100
thank you Nick for all you all you do

333
00:16:43,100 --> 00:16:45,350
and all you are appreciate you

334
00:16:45,350 --> 00:16:48,199
it is this local rationality that I

335
00:16:48,199 --> 00:16:51,350
think is at the heart of what I'm trying

336
00:16:51,350 --> 00:16:55,370
to share with you people are doing the

337
00:16:55,370 --> 00:16:58,040
best that they can with the things that

338
00:16:58,040 --> 00:17:01,060
they know and can see at the time and

339
00:17:01,060 --> 00:17:03,560
remember a few minutes ago I talked

340
00:17:03,560 --> 00:17:05,449
about hindsight bias and the problems

341
00:17:05,449 --> 00:17:06,020
with it

342
00:17:06,020 --> 00:17:09,890
so dr. Richard Crick has drawn this this

343
00:17:09,890 --> 00:17:12,679
illustration that is in Sidney Decker's

344
00:17:12,679 --> 00:17:15,980
book the field guide to human error and

345
00:17:15,980 --> 00:17:18,770
they described it in the moments you

346
00:17:18,770 --> 00:17:20,630
know we need to look at what the world

347
00:17:20,630 --> 00:17:22,970
looked like to people at the time

348
00:17:22,970 --> 00:17:25,699
remember you have hindsight they don't

349
00:17:25,699 --> 00:17:28,790
have that yet right they don't know what

350
00:17:28,790 --> 00:17:31,790
you you now know so you have to only

351
00:17:31,790 --> 00:17:34,730
look at what they saw as best as you can

352
00:17:34,730 --> 00:17:36,950
is to try to understand what the world

353
00:17:36,950 --> 00:17:38,990
looks like at the time otherwise you're

354
00:17:38,990 --> 00:17:40,940
just falling into these traps that I've

355
00:17:40,940 --> 00:17:43,030
warned you

356
00:17:43,030 --> 00:17:47,090
so listen I could talk all day about you

357
00:17:47,090 --> 00:17:49,100
know how wrong this is and how like

358
00:17:49,100 --> 00:17:53,720
damaging this is but let's be real if

359
00:17:53,720 --> 00:17:55,880
you have an addiction to the five wiser

360
00:17:55,880 --> 00:17:59,240
or any addiction we need to offer some

361
00:17:59,240 --> 00:18:01,429
replacement behaviors and and this is

362
00:18:01,429 --> 00:18:03,890
where I think we can really help our

363
00:18:03,890 --> 00:18:07,429
colleagues is you know when you see

364
00:18:07,429 --> 00:18:10,520
these types of things going on it's not

365
00:18:10,520 --> 00:18:12,410
that helpful they say you're doing it

366
00:18:12,410 --> 00:18:16,309
wrong instead you know you want to look

367
00:18:16,309 --> 00:18:18,980
at like how does it make sense for them

368
00:18:18,980 --> 00:18:21,650
you have to see that seductive lies that

369
00:18:21,650 --> 00:18:26,690
they have been told to even hope to like

370
00:18:26,690 --> 00:18:29,510
shift or change that behavior so I want

371
00:18:29,510 --> 00:18:31,520
to offer some replacement behaviors that

372
00:18:31,520 --> 00:18:34,760
you might think about and lean into if

373
00:18:34,760 --> 00:18:38,210
you get a chance the best thing that we

374
00:18:38,210 --> 00:18:40,660
have in our toolkit today is to run

375
00:18:40,660 --> 00:18:44,360
facilitated post incident reviews John

376
00:18:44,360 --> 00:18:46,610
also spoke about this this morning when

377
00:18:46,610 --> 00:18:49,160
he described that this should be a

378
00:18:49,160 --> 00:18:51,410
neutral facilitator you should not be

379
00:18:51,410 --> 00:18:53,740
the person who was running the incident

380
00:18:53,740 --> 00:18:56,620
but that having these facilitated

381
00:18:56,620 --> 00:19:00,110
discussions can really help you on earth

382
00:19:00,110 --> 00:19:03,020
and learn so much more you know a single

383
00:19:03,020 --> 00:19:05,270
engineer writing a post mortem probably

384
00:19:05,270 --> 00:19:07,419
isn't going to learn that much an

385
00:19:07,419 --> 00:19:09,620
organizational learning will will suffer

386
00:19:09,620 --> 00:19:13,610
as a result to John's point you know we

387
00:19:13,610 --> 00:19:16,910
need to ask better questions at how

388
00:19:16,910 --> 00:19:21,820
instead of why just shift that one thing

389
00:19:21,820 --> 00:19:25,370
ask how things went right as well you

390
00:19:25,370 --> 00:19:29,090
know there's things go wrong for many of

391
00:19:29,090 --> 00:19:31,400
the same reasons that they go right you

392
00:19:31,400 --> 00:19:34,580
know this all flows from the same mental

393
00:19:34,580 --> 00:19:36,950
processes so we need to look at like

394
00:19:36,950 --> 00:19:40,070
what went right for people because

395
00:19:40,070 --> 00:19:42,020
things could have always been worse I

396
00:19:42,020 --> 00:19:45,110
promise you now I just use the

397
00:19:45,110 --> 00:19:45,770
counterfactual

398
00:19:45,770 --> 00:19:48,080
could have helped you to help you caught

399
00:19:48,080 --> 00:19:51,140
that finally I want you to think about

400
00:19:51,140 --> 00:19:53,590
keeping your review and planning

401
00:19:53,590 --> 00:19:57,370
Brett citron also spoke about this as

402
00:19:57,370 --> 00:20:01,000
well when you shift into discussions

403
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:04,240
about action items you're done with the

404
00:20:04,240 --> 00:20:06,220
learning part you've moved on how could

405
00:20:06,220 --> 00:20:10,330
those repairs stand the test of time you

406
00:20:10,330 --> 00:20:11,679
need to keep those separate I would

407
00:20:11,679 --> 00:20:13,419
suggest holding that meeting a day or

408
00:20:13,419 --> 00:20:15,880
two later and hold it with people who

409
00:20:15,880 --> 00:20:19,120
can actually move the backlog around

410
00:20:19,120 --> 00:20:22,150
stop playing backlog bingo when you when

411
00:20:22,150 --> 00:20:23,770
you don't have the right people in the

412
00:20:23,770 --> 00:20:28,090
room to make those decisions so again

413
00:20:28,090 --> 00:20:30,460
those are some replacement behaviors but

414
00:20:30,460 --> 00:20:32,980
I think might be useful for you to try

415
00:20:32,980 --> 00:20:35,409
to just noodle on and think about how

416
00:20:35,409 --> 00:20:37,840
you might try those things out if you

417
00:20:37,840 --> 00:20:41,590
think it's worth doing but I want to

418
00:20:41,590 --> 00:20:45,220
give you a couple of things to sort of

419
00:20:45,220 --> 00:20:49,450
begin to wrap our time together you

420
00:20:49,450 --> 00:20:50,919
probably know because I won't shut up

421
00:20:50,919 --> 00:20:53,230
about it but I'm in the masters and

422
00:20:53,230 --> 00:20:55,390
human factors and system safety at loons

423
00:20:55,390 --> 00:20:59,020
University and one of the students in my

424
00:20:59,020 --> 00:21:02,950
program who's a pilot tweeted or he he

425
00:21:02,950 --> 00:21:06,520
shared this and I just wanted you to

426
00:21:06,520 --> 00:21:08,620
know that great things can happen when

427
00:21:08,620 --> 00:21:10,960
you try other things so this other

428
00:21:10,960 --> 00:21:13,149
toolkit you should know about is the

429
00:21:13,149 --> 00:21:17,100
action map so he said his authority

430
00:21:17,100 --> 00:21:21,640
referring to the the leadership and in

431
00:21:21,640 --> 00:21:24,159
the airline's they just accepted an

432
00:21:24,159 --> 00:21:26,950
accent map to close a problem close out

433
00:21:26,950 --> 00:21:29,799
a accident that occurred screw you five

434
00:21:29,799 --> 00:21:33,730
wise so these are really exciting to me

435
00:21:33,730 --> 00:21:37,360
to know that that these other outcomes

436
00:21:37,360 --> 00:21:41,620
are possible and you can try this too

437
00:21:41,620 --> 00:21:44,590
yeah this isn't special you you can

438
00:21:44,590 --> 00:21:46,090
learn these things you could try them as

439
00:21:46,090 --> 00:21:52,899
well as I promised some parting thoughts

440
00:21:52,899 --> 00:22:02,290
as we as I close my rant all credit to

441
00:22:02,290 --> 00:22:07,420
but when you hear RCA henceforth you

442
00:22:07,420 --> 00:22:09,880
shall thank respective cover of ass and

443
00:22:09,880 --> 00:22:13,710
silently or not you can laugh and your

444
00:22:13,710 --> 00:22:18,550
these meetings maybe maybe that won't

445
00:22:18,550 --> 00:22:22,180
have the best outcome but it is it's

446
00:22:22,180 --> 00:22:24,520
it's how can we retrospectively cover

447
00:22:24,520 --> 00:22:27,040
our ass this is the defense mechanism

448
00:22:27,040 --> 00:22:29,560
that get invoked when you go with the

449
00:22:29,560 --> 00:22:32,320
old methods of five wise and root cause

450
00:22:32,320 --> 00:22:37,540
analysis what are most root cause

451
00:22:37,540 --> 00:22:40,390
analysis if not a lie that everyone

452
00:22:40,390 --> 00:22:45,430
agrees on just one of the many lies that

453
00:22:45,430 --> 00:22:51,070
I hope to hope to debunk with you gonna

454
00:22:51,070 --> 00:22:55,450
get punchy here when you start to

455
00:22:55,450 --> 00:22:57,340
question these practices in your

456
00:22:57,340 --> 00:23:01,860
workplace I how you do that

457
00:23:01,860 --> 00:23:04,600
can be dangerous it can be career

458
00:23:04,600 --> 00:23:09,010
limiting move but I assert that any

459
00:23:09,010 --> 00:23:11,910
place that you're working that does not

460
00:23:11,910 --> 00:23:15,430
allow you to deeply question previous

461
00:23:15,430 --> 00:23:17,890
practices again how you approach it

462
00:23:17,890 --> 00:23:20,920
matters if you come in there you know

463
00:23:20,920 --> 00:23:23,230
waving the big flag of you're doing it

464
00:23:23,230 --> 00:23:24,730
wrong like you're not gonna have a great

465
00:23:24,730 --> 00:23:28,390
result but if you can you know explore

466
00:23:28,390 --> 00:23:31,540
with a colleague or two and 93 and then

467
00:23:31,540 --> 00:23:34,380
five and start to talk with people about

468
00:23:34,380 --> 00:23:36,640
you know what they hope to get out of

469
00:23:36,640 --> 00:23:39,220
these practices you might have a better

470
00:23:39,220 --> 00:23:43,660
result but listen if if that is not

471
00:23:43,660 --> 00:23:45,750
tolerated

472
00:23:45,750 --> 00:23:50,080
you know Jam talks about being you know

473
00:23:50,080 --> 00:23:53,440
she was told to basically be quiet you

474
00:23:53,440 --> 00:23:56,590
know and then not talk about it that is

475
00:23:56,590 --> 00:23:59,230
not safe it's not a safe workspace

476
00:23:59,230 --> 00:24:02,590
there's zero psychological safety -

477
00:24:02,590 --> 00:24:05,290
Matt's talked earlier and you need to

478
00:24:05,290 --> 00:24:08,620
get out now that maybe that's a very

479
00:24:08,620 --> 00:24:11,470
privileged thing to say and and but

480
00:24:11,470 --> 00:24:13,030
there were days that I really did have

481
00:24:13,030 --> 00:24:15,970
to be willing to to

482
00:24:15,970 --> 00:24:18,520
to leave to stand for what I believe in

483
00:24:18,520 --> 00:24:21,460
which is to try to help people and to

484
00:24:21,460 --> 00:24:24,070
try to help engineers learn more from

485
00:24:24,070 --> 00:24:29,340
these incidents so think deeply about

486
00:24:29,340 --> 00:24:31,990
you know your safety and that of your

487
00:24:31,990 --> 00:24:34,420
colleagues as you start to question

488
00:24:34,420 --> 00:24:40,060
these practices okay our words matter

489
00:24:40,060 --> 00:24:45,790
our words have consequences when I talk

490
00:24:45,790 --> 00:24:49,240
about shifting from how to from Y to how

491
00:24:49,240 --> 00:24:53,170
it matters there's a reason that I'm

492
00:24:53,170 --> 00:24:55,740
proposing that I've tried to offer some

493
00:24:55,740 --> 00:24:59,680
background on why you know how it is

494
00:24:59,680 --> 00:25:02,410
that these word shifts really matter but

495
00:25:02,410 --> 00:25:05,410
they do matter it's they matter a lot

496
00:25:05,410 --> 00:25:09,700
and I hope that some of these things

497
00:25:09,700 --> 00:25:13,120
I've talked with you today about will

498
00:25:13,120 --> 00:25:15,310
give you some food for thought and to

499
00:25:15,310 --> 00:25:17,920
help you perk up your ears when you

500
00:25:17,920 --> 00:25:20,610
start to hear those counterfactuals

501
00:25:20,610 --> 00:25:26,200
think deeply about what you know of

502
00:25:26,200 --> 00:25:29,260
course intention matters and B I don't

503
00:25:29,260 --> 00:25:31,240
think people ought mean to be harmful

504
00:25:31,240 --> 00:25:32,230
with these things

505
00:25:32,230 --> 00:25:35,650
I think they simply don't know the

506
00:25:35,650 --> 00:25:39,670
damage that they might be doing so try

507
00:25:39,670 --> 00:25:42,100
to carry a lot of kindness in your heart

508
00:25:42,100 --> 00:25:43,620
for when you're trying to approach

509
00:25:43,620 --> 00:25:46,030
making these kind of shifts in language

510
00:25:46,030 --> 00:25:50,800
and changes I'm very grateful to be a

511
00:25:50,800 --> 00:25:53,200

512
00:25:53,200 --> 00:25:55,780
practitioners some of their names I've

513
00:25:55,780 --> 00:25:58,630

517
00:26:06,130 --> 00:26:10,480

their nations so we can really make a

531
00:26:48,850 --> 00:26:51,940
big difference for people with your

532
00:26:51,940 --> 00:26:54,490

534
00:26:57,460 --> 00:27:00,940
and with that I would like to take any

535
00:27:00,940 --> 00:27:02,820
questions that you might have

536
00:27:02,820 --> 00:27:05,860
hey Jessica great talk we do have a few

537
00:27:05,860 --> 00:27:08,650
questions here so we'll just go right

538
00:27:08,650 --> 00:27:12,310
into those from Steve how does the NTSB

539
00:27:12,310 --> 00:27:14,260
process compared to these concerns that

540
00:27:14,260 --> 00:27:18,640
you and John have laid out and this be

541
00:27:18,640 --> 00:27:23,800
so I so there's um there's been a number

542
00:27:23,800 --> 00:27:25,840
of mornings where I argue with the NTSB

543
00:27:25,840 --> 00:27:30,850
on Twitter because you know from time to

544
00:27:30,850 --> 00:27:33,940
time they you know do talk about you

545
00:27:33,940 --> 00:27:38,260
know trying to use more of these more

546
00:27:38,260 --> 00:27:40,630
modern approaches that are backed by

547
00:27:40,630 --> 00:27:44,010
decades of research and human factors

548
00:27:44,010 --> 00:27:47,650
but I continue to see them talk about

549
00:27:47,650 --> 00:27:50,320
causes I do continue to see them use

550
00:27:50,320 --> 00:27:54,100
counterfactual language it's really

551
00:27:54,100 --> 00:27:56,350
problematic so I I think we still have

552
00:27:56,350 --> 00:27:58,870
work to do I don't know if the guy who

553
00:27:58,870 --> 00:28:02,200
wrote the guy or gal who runs the NTSB

554
00:28:02,200 --> 00:28:04,090
Twitter account you know I just I don't

555
00:28:04,090 --> 00:28:06,910
know them but I do you know that we

556
00:28:06,910 --> 00:28:08,470
continue to have work to do you know

557
00:28:08,470 --> 00:28:10,480
this isn't a thing we're just going to

558
00:28:10,480 --> 00:28:13,180
solve tonight and like now we solve that

559
00:28:13,180 --> 00:28:15,670
but you know so I guess to try to answer

560
00:28:15,670 --> 00:28:17,470
that question is we really do need to

561
00:28:17,470 --> 00:28:21,700
continue to you know hope that they they

562
00:28:21,700 --> 00:28:25,030
will get the message and work to use a

563
00:28:25,030 --> 00:28:28,210
better less harmful language in their

564
00:28:28,210 --> 00:28:30,760
public and hopefully in their

565
00:28:30,760 --> 00:28:34,450
investigations okay great next question

566
00:28:34,450 --> 00:28:36,340
is there still any value in the five

567
00:28:36,340 --> 00:28:37,940
why's left

568
00:28:37,940 --> 00:28:42,920
no no no yeah I mean again you're not

569
00:28:42,920 --> 00:28:46,490
working in systems that would in any way

570
00:28:46,490 --> 00:28:49,610
be appropriate for this method I want to

571
00:28:49,610 --> 00:28:54,920
be clear that there's nothing there's

572
00:28:54,920 --> 00:28:56,180
nothing you're gonna learn that you

573
00:28:56,180 --> 00:28:58,310
don't already know the five whys don't

574
00:28:58,310 --> 00:29:00,710
you don't ask question anything it

575
00:29:00,710 --> 00:29:02,060
doesn't give you any answers that you

576
00:29:02,060 --> 00:29:05,030
don't already know I don't think there's

577
00:29:05,030 --> 00:29:07,580
any value left there just why I'm trying

578
00:29:07,580 --> 00:29:09,740
to give this talk and you know offer

579
00:29:09,740 --> 00:29:12,140
some some alternatives I do think it

580
00:29:12,140 --> 00:29:15,950
should absolutely never be used I just

581
00:29:15,950 --> 00:29:18,050
love the unequivocal no that's that's a

582
00:29:18,050 --> 00:29:20,990
beautiful last question actually for me

583
00:29:20,990 --> 00:29:22,520
when we talk about neutral facilitators

584
00:29:22,520 --> 00:29:24,110
are we talking about people just

585
00:29:24,110 --> 00:29:25,820
avoiding like the incident commander or

586
00:29:25,820 --> 00:29:27,290
are we saying anyone that was involved

587
00:29:27,290 --> 00:29:28,700
with the incident shouldn't be

588
00:29:28,700 --> 00:29:33,620
facilitator so yeah so let me try to

589
00:29:33,620 --> 00:29:36,950
clarify what I mean there if you were

590
00:29:36,950 --> 00:29:39,290
responding to the incident if you were

591
00:29:39,290 --> 00:29:43,520
the incident commander if you were one

592
00:29:43,520 --> 00:29:45,260
of one of the people involved with

593
00:29:45,260 --> 00:29:48,770
mitigation if you then serve and try to

594
00:29:48,770 --> 00:29:52,280
serve as a facilitator you will carry a

595
00:29:52,280 --> 00:29:56,540
bias into that meeting and you you can't

596
00:29:56,540 --> 00:29:59,330
you can't not have a bias who were

597
00:29:59,330 --> 00:30:01,970
deeply involved you need to ask one of

598
00:30:01,970 --> 00:30:03,860
your colleagues if they would serve as a

599
00:30:03,860 --> 00:30:07,250
facilitator for you so that you can you

600
00:30:07,250 --> 00:30:11,060
can respond in the meeting as as the

601
00:30:11,060 --> 00:30:13,730
role you serve like we need to hear from

602
00:30:13,730 --> 00:30:15,980
you about what you experienced what was

603
00:30:15,980 --> 00:30:18,800
hard for you if you're the facilitator

604
00:30:18,800 --> 00:30:21,080
you can you do those things and you

605
00:30:21,080 --> 00:30:22,940
can't like neatly take off your

606
00:30:22,940 --> 00:30:26,630
facilitator hat and and then respond you

607
00:30:26,630 --> 00:30:31,430
I just think you really lose so much and

608
00:30:31,430 --> 00:30:36,860
mostly we lose or your experience as as

609
00:30:36,860 --> 00:30:38,540
the person who's deeply involved at the

610
00:30:38,540 --> 00:30:41,690
Indians event thank you yeah that makes

611
00:30:41,690 --> 00:30:43,340
a lot of sense unfortunately we got to

612
00:30:43,340 --> 00:30:44,480
leave it there we do still have some

613
00:30:44,480 --> 00:30:46,370
