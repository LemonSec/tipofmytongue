1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,319
Nate maybe if you can share your camera

2
00:00:04,319 --> 00:00:07,020
please you're you are and I see you're

3
00:00:07,020 --> 00:00:10,260
already sharing your screen cool correct

4
00:00:10,260 --> 00:00:14,340
I don't see no camera I do have roll-off

5
00:00:14,340 --> 00:00:20,340
cuz my office is regularly lit dad is no

6
00:00:20,340 --> 00:00:23,460
problem so then I will I will just full

7
00:00:23,460 --> 00:00:25,670
focus on your on your screen in this

8
00:00:25,670 --> 00:00:29,189
matter I would say this the stage is

9
00:00:29,189 --> 00:00:31,140
yours let's not waste any time because

10
00:00:31,140 --> 00:00:33,690
we only have have basically 25 minutes

11
00:00:33,690 --> 00:00:36,600
of talks and five minutes of Q&A well

12
00:00:36,600 --> 00:00:37,410
let's give it a go

13
00:00:37,410 --> 00:00:39,719
I'm on it thank you very much and good

14
00:00:39,719 --> 00:00:40,739
morning good afternoon good evening

15
00:00:40,739 --> 00:00:42,390
depending on your timezone my name is

16
00:00:42,390 --> 00:00:44,579
nate judah best way to describe me as

17
00:00:44,579 --> 00:00:47,579
architect as a service I go places at

18
00:00:47,579 --> 00:00:49,890
least I used to before global pandemic

19
00:00:49,890 --> 00:00:50,399
struck

20
00:00:50,399 --> 00:00:52,020
maybe I'll go places again in the future

21
00:00:52,020 --> 00:00:53,789
I work for VMware I'm part of the

22
00:00:53,789 --> 00:00:56,129
advocacy group so I'm mostly architect

23
00:00:56,129 --> 00:00:58,289
guy have spent a lot of years doing

24
00:00:58,289 --> 00:01:00,120
various things and software engineering

25
00:01:00,120 --> 00:01:02,219
mostly at a big Enterprise II companies

26
00:01:02,219 --> 00:01:04,379
and so I've seen this shift over my

27
00:01:04,379 --> 00:01:06,330
career you know this used to be so easy

28
00:01:06,330 --> 00:01:09,240
we had a monolith or two or three and we

29
00:01:09,240 --> 00:01:11,760
released versions semi-annually we all

30
00:01:11,760 --> 00:01:13,799
worked on the same floor or at least

31
00:01:13,799 --> 00:01:16,170
pretty close to one another but looking

32
00:01:16,170 --> 00:01:17,909
around now that's just not the reality

33
00:01:17,909 --> 00:01:20,310
for us you've probably got dozens or

34
00:01:20,310 --> 00:01:22,650
hundreds or thousands of services and

35
00:01:22,650 --> 00:01:24,750
some of those versions are changing

36
00:01:24,750 --> 00:01:27,810
every day multiple times a day your team

37
00:01:27,810 --> 00:01:30,270
isn't all co-located in one office

38
00:01:30,270 --> 00:01:32,189
you've got folks all over the world and

39
00:01:32,189 --> 00:01:35,790
to be clear architect job of this role

40
00:01:35,790 --> 00:01:38,759
has never been easy but now we have to

41
00:01:38,759 --> 00:01:40,229
deal with massively distributed

42
00:01:40,229 --> 00:01:42,600
applications with teams that are also

43
00:01:42,600 --> 00:01:45,060
themselves dispersed all around the

44
00:01:45,060 --> 00:01:47,790
world and how do we handle that the

45
00:01:47,790 --> 00:01:50,070
first step in any of these situations is

46
00:01:50,070 --> 00:01:52,470
just acknowledge reality I mean we're

47
00:01:52,470 --> 00:01:55,380
not all in the same project room anymore

48
00:01:55,380 --> 00:01:57,630
and in fact we're probably not even all

49
00:01:57,630 --> 00:02:00,149
on the same continent it's been pretty

50
00:02:00,149 --> 00:02:02,579
clear to me that remote remote work is

51
00:02:02,579 --> 00:02:04,649
more normalized and this is certainly

52
00:02:04,649 --> 00:02:06,810
before we've gotten into the coronavirus

53
00:02:06,810 --> 00:02:08,489
but you know there's been a series of

54
00:02:08,489 --> 00:02:11,160
articles over the last few years talking

55
00:02:11,160 --> 00:02:13,150
about how remote work is becoming

56
00:02:13,150 --> 00:02:15,340
more common and more people are asking

57
00:02:15,340 --> 00:02:17,799
for this remote work statistics are

58
00:02:17,799 --> 00:02:19,329
frankly pretty mind-blowing when you see

59
00:02:19,329 --> 00:02:20,890
how many people are actually doing it

60
00:02:20,890 --> 00:02:23,049
you know the thought works folks have

61
00:02:23,049 --> 00:02:25,299
talked quite a bit about this and you

62
00:02:25,299 --> 00:02:27,250
know this began during the recession of

63
00:02:27,250 --> 00:02:29,349
kind of a 809 as a way for companies to

64
00:02:29,349 --> 00:02:31,540
save money on office space and then many

65
00:02:31,540 --> 00:02:33,040
of us now looked at it said hey this is

66
00:02:33,040 --> 00:02:35,500
strategic I actually view it personally

67
00:02:35,500 --> 00:02:36,730
as a requirement I've been working

68
00:02:36,730 --> 00:02:38,250
full-time from home now for three years

69
00:02:38,250 --> 00:02:40,780
and a lot of this boils down to the

70
00:02:40,780 --> 00:02:42,879
desire for flexibility the desire to

71
00:02:42,879 --> 00:02:45,940
have more family time to deal with house

72
00:02:45,940 --> 00:02:48,099
prices that are out of control to not

73
00:02:48,099 --> 00:02:50,109
want to have multiple hour-long commutes

74
00:02:50,109 --> 00:02:51,760
and of course this is all before what

75
00:02:51,760 --> 00:02:52,900
many of us are dealing with right now

76
00:02:52,900 --> 00:02:55,269
with coronavirus and so I do you think

77
00:02:55,269 --> 00:02:56,400
this is gonna have a pretty substantial

78
00:02:56,400 --> 00:02:58,840
effect on this whole work from home

79
00:02:58,840 --> 00:03:01,180
movement as well I know Martin has

80
00:03:01,180 --> 00:03:02,409
posted a couple of different pieces

81
00:03:02,409 --> 00:03:04,299
about how thought Works is handling this

82
00:03:04,299 --> 00:03:05,709
has been very interesting to see the

83
00:03:05,709 --> 00:03:07,000
kind of challenges that they've been

84
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:09,099
dealing with and I ran into this article

85
00:03:09,099 --> 00:03:10,900
actually today talking about how this is

86
00:03:10,900 --> 00:03:13,239
probably going to accelerate the future

87
00:03:13,239 --> 00:03:15,519
of work what we look at as the norm now

88
00:03:15,519 --> 00:03:17,709
and how that's going to change over the

89
00:03:17,709 --> 00:03:22,419
course of the next next few months I saw

90
00:03:22,419 --> 00:03:23,949
this tweet and I thought you know it's

91
00:03:23,949 --> 00:03:25,510
gonna be interesting to see how people

92
00:03:25,510 --> 00:03:27,970
react once we do start loosening up some

93
00:03:27,970 --> 00:03:29,470
of these social distancing guidelines

94
00:03:29,470 --> 00:03:31,299
you know I know my wife has been working

95
00:03:31,299 --> 00:03:32,949
full-time from home now for about a

96
00:03:32,949 --> 00:03:34,269
month and it's gonna be interesting to

97
00:03:34,269 --> 00:03:37,060
see how she shifts back and it's gonna

98
00:03:37,060 --> 00:03:38,530
be really interesting to see what kind

99
00:03:38,530 --> 00:03:41,019
of offices we even go back to when this

100
00:03:41,019 --> 00:03:43,000
is all over you know I think the pretty

101
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:44,949
decent chance these open office spaces

102
00:03:44,949 --> 00:03:48,159
might be doomed in this new world and so

103
00:03:48,159 --> 00:03:50,169
putting aside pandemics and natural

104
00:03:50,169 --> 00:03:52,359
disasters you know let's be honest

105
00:03:52,359 --> 00:03:53,859
there's a pretty good chance that most

106
00:03:53,859 --> 00:03:55,389
of the best talent in the world is not

107
00:03:55,389 --> 00:03:58,870
located within a generous distance from

108
00:03:58,870 --> 00:04:01,090
your headquarters and more and more of

109
00:04:01,090 --> 00:04:02,919
us frankly want to work remotely I know

110
00:04:02,919 --> 00:04:04,599
a good friend of mine was doing a job

111
00:04:04,599 --> 00:04:06,970
search about a year ago and there were a

112
00:04:06,970 --> 00:04:08,500
couple companies like all yeah great

113
00:04:08,500 --> 00:04:10,060
let's let's get you on board and I'm

114
00:04:10,060 --> 00:04:11,199
like okay we're gonna need to relocate

115
00:04:11,199 --> 00:04:13,629
and he was like lol no you know this is

116
00:04:13,629 --> 00:04:15,250
where I live this is where my family is

117
00:04:15,250 --> 00:04:16,930
I'm not gonna uproot them just for this

118
00:04:16,930 --> 00:04:18,668
job and so he turned down two or three

119
00:04:18,668 --> 00:04:20,349
jobs because he you know some of these

120
00:04:20,349 --> 00:04:21,668
companies just weren't interested in

121
00:04:21,668 --> 00:04:24,550
that a lot of us find much increased job

122
00:04:24,550 --> 00:04:26,320
satisfaction out of this I don't think

123
00:04:26,320 --> 00:04:27,010
that's too much

124
00:04:27,010 --> 00:04:28,840
surprised I think many of us are more

125
00:04:28,840 --> 00:04:30,610
productive when we're working from home

126
00:04:30,610 --> 00:04:33,370
although it is hard sometimes to keep

127
00:04:33,370 --> 00:04:35,770
that balance in place it's very easy for

128
00:04:35,770 --> 00:04:37,990
work to bleed into life more than we

129
00:04:37,990 --> 00:04:41,350
would like a lot of us are working from

130
00:04:41,350 --> 00:04:43,150
home more often this again is

131
00:04:43,150 --> 00:04:44,770
interesting as CF statistics on this

132
00:04:44,770 --> 00:04:46,150
have changed which I don't think it's

133
00:04:46,150 --> 00:04:48,430
too much of a surprise now I don't have

134
00:04:48,430 --> 00:04:50,140
an office in any of our buildings least

135
00:04:50,140 --> 00:04:52,510
not that I'm aware of my entire team is

136
00:04:52,510 --> 00:04:55,300
distributed around the world a huge

137
00:04:55,300 --> 00:04:56,830
chunk of people in the u.s. work from

138
00:04:56,830 --> 00:04:58,240
home at least some of the time and

139
00:04:58,240 --> 00:04:59,890
that's not to say it's all of the time

140
00:04:59,890 --> 00:05:01,300
it might be one day a week it might be

141
00:05:01,300 --> 00:05:03,850
periodically and for many people it's a

142
00:05:03,850 --> 00:05:05,320
bit of an adjustment there's no getting

143
00:05:05,320 --> 00:05:06,670
around it it's been interesting to see

144
00:05:06,670 --> 00:05:09,100
how with my wife working in the other

145
00:05:09,100 --> 00:05:11,080
room and my son now doing learning from

146
00:05:11,080 --> 00:05:12,940
home to see how we've all kind of

147
00:05:12,940 --> 00:05:14,860
adjusted to all of us being around each

148
00:05:14,860 --> 00:05:16,990
other all of the time and how do we sort

149
00:05:16,990 --> 00:05:19,390
of have some of these separations I know

150
00:05:19,390 --> 00:05:21,070
a number of people who actually have a

151
00:05:21,070 --> 00:05:23,230
routine to signal the start or the end

152
00:05:23,230 --> 00:05:25,420
of their day it's got Hanselman tweeted

153
00:05:25,420 --> 00:05:27,700
this out at one point saying hey go

154
00:05:27,700 --> 00:05:29,500
commute quote unquote to your home

155
00:05:29,500 --> 00:05:31,150
office and what he meant was just walk

156
00:05:31,150 --> 00:05:32,980
around the block basically and I had

157
00:05:32,980 --> 00:05:35,350
friends who would walk out the back door

158
00:05:35,350 --> 00:05:36,670
of their house walk around the front

159
00:05:36,670 --> 00:05:37,960
door of their house to signal the

160
00:05:37,960 --> 00:05:39,310
beginning of the day and then walk out

161
00:05:39,310 --> 00:05:40,390
the front door of their house and then

162
00:05:40,390 --> 00:05:42,010
back into the back door as a way of

163
00:05:42,010 --> 00:05:44,350
ending their day I tend to do this by

164
00:05:44,350 --> 00:05:46,330
what I'm wearing now my wife jokes that

165
00:05:46,330 --> 00:05:48,160
I wear work from home pajamas she's not

166
00:05:48,160 --> 00:05:50,830
wrong but I have sort of in my head this

167
00:05:50,830 --> 00:05:52,870
is sort of work attire versus this is

168
00:05:52,870 --> 00:05:55,930
lounge attire if you will now what's

169
00:05:55,930 --> 00:05:58,150
fascinating to me is even when I have

170
00:05:58,150 --> 00:05:59,710
been in a physical office with other

171
00:05:59,710 --> 00:06:01,570
people it's a pretty good chance you

172
00:06:01,570 --> 00:06:02,770
were using some kind of remote

173
00:06:02,770 --> 00:06:05,440
communication technology anyway when I

174
00:06:05,440 --> 00:06:07,380
was an architect at an enterprise

175
00:06:07,380 --> 00:06:09,790
financial company not too long ago I

176
00:06:09,790 --> 00:06:11,470
took almost all of my meetings from my

177
00:06:11,470 --> 00:06:13,240
desk because it was the only way I could

178
00:06:13,240 --> 00:06:14,680
get to all my meetings and so even

179
00:06:14,680 --> 00:06:16,030
though there were meeting rooms

180
00:06:16,030 --> 00:06:17,740
somewhere I was never in them because it

181
00:06:17,740 --> 00:06:19,720
was easier to do it while sitting in my

182
00:06:19,720 --> 00:06:21,610
desk and I realized one day we don't

183
00:06:21,610 --> 00:06:23,620
whether I'm at home or in my office in

184
00:06:23,620 --> 00:06:25,690
st. Paul doesn't really changed much

185
00:06:25,690 --> 00:06:28,570
frankly and of course whether you're

186
00:06:28,570 --> 00:06:30,490
nine feet or nine floors or nine miles

187
00:06:30,490 --> 00:06:31,750
away there's a pretty good chance that

188
00:06:31,750 --> 00:06:33,580
you're working with people over slack

189
00:06:33,580 --> 00:06:36,090
and over other types of communication

190
00:06:36,090 --> 00:06:37,720
technologies there's a pretty good

191
00:06:37,720 --> 00:06:38,710
chance everyone

192
00:06:38,710 --> 00:06:41,289
this this this stream has messaged

193
00:06:41,289 --> 00:06:43,300
someone that's next to them across the

194
00:06:43,300 --> 00:06:44,889
hall from them you know we don't have to

195
00:06:44,889 --> 00:06:46,300
be around the world in order to use

196
00:06:46,300 --> 00:06:48,070
these it's been really interesting to

197
00:06:48,070 --> 00:06:49,810
see how these tools have improved

198
00:06:49,810 --> 00:06:51,910
I mean maybe slack hasn't been a huge

199
00:06:51,910 --> 00:06:53,440
improvement I don't know we could argue

200
00:06:53,440 --> 00:06:56,020
about that around the edges but I can

201
00:06:56,020 --> 00:06:57,520
basically do my entire job for my laptop

202
00:06:57,520 --> 00:06:59,350
where my laptop is that's what my office

203
00:06:59,350 --> 00:07:01,479
is you know we've all got soft phones or

204
00:07:01,479 --> 00:07:02,830
cell phones and there's an awful lot

205
00:07:02,830 --> 00:07:04,570
that we can accomplish without needing

206
00:07:04,570 --> 00:07:05,949
some of the tools that we used to have

207
00:07:05,949 --> 00:07:08,800
back in the old days video conferencing

208
00:07:08,800 --> 00:07:11,770
helps I was on one remote project many

209
00:07:11,770 --> 00:07:13,479
years ago where we had one group of

210
00:07:13,479 --> 00:07:14,740
people in st. Paul one group of people

211
00:07:14,740 --> 00:07:16,630
in Hartford and it wasn't working real

212
00:07:16,630 --> 00:07:18,520
well until we installed video

213
00:07:18,520 --> 00:07:20,979
conferencing in both rooms and it was a

214
00:07:20,979 --> 00:07:22,389
little weird at first because the

215
00:07:22,389 --> 00:07:23,919
expectation was that the video

216
00:07:23,919 --> 00:07:25,690
conferencing would be on the entire time

217
00:07:25,690 --> 00:07:27,820
and so it was a little strange you know

218
00:07:27,820 --> 00:07:28,870
you'd walk in in the morning first

219
00:07:28,870 --> 00:07:30,610
person would turn the computer would

220
00:07:30,610 --> 00:07:32,050
turn the video conferencing system on

221
00:07:32,050 --> 00:07:33,280
and then the last person that would shut

222
00:07:33,280 --> 00:07:34,840
it down and so there's always a little

223
00:07:34,840 --> 00:07:37,449
bit of this is kind of strange but we

224
00:07:37,449 --> 00:07:39,160
gradually adjusted to the fact that when

225
00:07:39,160 --> 00:07:40,599
we'd start to communicate with somebody

226
00:07:40,599 --> 00:07:42,669
over email or over messaging you'd be

227
00:07:42,669 --> 00:07:43,870
like hey let's just go to the window

228
00:07:43,870 --> 00:07:45,400
that's what a lot of us refer to it as

229
00:07:45,400 --> 00:07:46,900
and he'd walk over and you'd have

230
00:07:46,900 --> 00:07:48,789
essentially a face-to-face conversation

231
00:07:48,789 --> 00:07:50,560
and it greatly simplified things in many

232
00:07:50,560 --> 00:07:53,020
ways now of course keep in mind that

233
00:07:53,020 --> 00:07:55,270
conference lines often have just enough

234
00:07:55,270 --> 00:07:57,099
of a lag to be annoying it's very easy

235
00:07:57,099 --> 00:07:59,139
to talk over people you need to be very

236
00:07:59,139 --> 00:08:01,030
respectful of your remote staff and be

237
00:08:01,030 --> 00:08:04,000
very very aware of time zones the

238
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:05,680
hardest part about remote teams is

239
00:08:05,680 --> 00:08:07,270
tribal knowledge kind of goes out the

240
00:08:07,270 --> 00:08:09,940
window although to be blunt tribal

241
00:08:09,940 --> 00:08:11,320
knowledge isn't really great to begin

242
00:08:11,320 --> 00:08:12,940
with so there's gonna be a little more

243
00:08:12,940 --> 00:08:14,530
ceremony than we might have in a

244
00:08:14,530 --> 00:08:16,389
traditional project room it can't just

245
00:08:16,389 --> 00:08:19,180
be the whiteboard but I want to stress

246
00:08:19,180 --> 00:08:21,310
you shouldn't be overly prescriptive and

247
00:08:21,310 --> 00:08:23,289
how you approach these things different

248
00:08:23,289 --> 00:08:24,849
teams will work in different ways and

249
00:08:24,849 --> 00:08:26,919
that's perfectly fine you just need to

250
00:08:26,919 --> 00:08:28,810
do what's right you need to experiment

251
00:08:28,810 --> 00:08:31,210
you need to adapt and you need to be

252
00:08:31,210 --> 00:08:31,840
patient

253
00:08:31,840 --> 00:08:33,729
we've seen a lot of that and frankly as

254
00:08:33,729 --> 00:08:36,219
people have adjusted to this you should

255
00:08:36,219 --> 00:08:37,899
also be willing to learn from people

256
00:08:37,899 --> 00:08:39,669
who've done this before or you know the

257
00:08:39,669 --> 00:08:41,200
base camp folks have been doing this for

258
00:08:41,200 --> 00:08:42,490
a long time they've got various

259
00:08:42,490 --> 00:08:44,820
information on their website about this

260
00:08:44,820 --> 00:08:46,959
we've been doing this for quite a long

261
00:08:46,959 --> 00:08:48,760
time as well we've done quite a bit of

262
00:08:48,760 --> 00:08:50,930
remote pairing over the years

263
00:08:50,930 --> 00:08:53,149
so you know it can be done you know

264
00:08:53,149 --> 00:08:54,620
don't don't feel like this is impossible

265
00:08:54,620 --> 00:08:57,140
by any stretch imagination now

266
00:08:57,140 --> 00:08:59,510
distributed teams are part of the

267
00:08:59,510 --> 00:09:01,430
challenge one of the things that I

268
00:09:01,430 --> 00:09:03,620
realized pretty early on in my architect

269
00:09:03,620 --> 00:09:06,380
career was we're spread pretty thin I

270
00:09:06,380 --> 00:09:08,300
used to think that we didn't have great

271
00:09:08,300 --> 00:09:10,190
architects because I hardly ever talked

272
00:09:10,190 --> 00:09:11,660
to mine and then as soon as I became an

273
00:09:11,660 --> 00:09:13,399
architect I had like 40 projects dropped

274
00:09:13,399 --> 00:09:15,680
in my head the next morning and that's a

275
00:09:15,680 --> 00:09:17,240
lot for you to juggle you know you got

276
00:09:17,240 --> 00:09:19,220
to prioritize all these things to try to

277
00:09:19,220 --> 00:09:20,720
figure out you know which projects need

278
00:09:20,720 --> 00:09:23,630
me and which ones can I let kind of work

279
00:09:23,630 --> 00:09:25,250
on their own and so there's a couple

280
00:09:25,250 --> 00:09:27,230
ways to think about this I mean one is

281
00:09:27,230 --> 00:09:29,330
cost complexity and risk in other words

282
00:09:29,330 --> 00:09:31,790
what's the impact of failure obviously

283
00:09:31,790 --> 00:09:33,560
those projects that are more costly

284
00:09:33,560 --> 00:09:35,029
where the impact of failure is a bigger

285
00:09:35,029 --> 00:09:36,200
deal we'll probably need more of your

286
00:09:36,200 --> 00:09:38,540
time and attention it's also important

287
00:09:38,540 --> 00:09:40,279
to let your teams judge to this a little

288
00:09:40,279 --> 00:09:41,959
bit too you know you look at some teams

289
00:09:41,959 --> 00:09:43,760
they're more mature they might not need

290
00:09:43,760 --> 00:09:45,709
as much help if you've got teams that

291
00:09:45,709 --> 00:09:47,000
are struggling they might need a little

292
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:49,940
more help especially early on it's also

293
00:09:49,940 --> 00:09:51,680
important to realize that some projects

294
00:09:51,680 --> 00:09:53,690
are doing more novel work they might

295
00:09:53,690 --> 00:09:55,400
require a bit more hand-holding and of

296
00:09:55,400 --> 00:09:57,320
course any projects that are on the

297
00:09:57,320 --> 00:09:59,360
c-suites radar probably are ones that

298
00:09:59,360 --> 00:10:01,040
need to be higher up in our priority

299
00:10:01,040 --> 00:10:03,020
list now if you're not sure what you

300
00:10:03,020 --> 00:10:04,370
should do well talk to your management

301
00:10:04,370 --> 00:10:06,740
try to figure it out help them guide you

302
00:10:06,740 --> 00:10:09,470
on the prioritization but no matter how

303
00:10:09,470 --> 00:10:11,270
you prioritize your projects you realize

304
00:10:11,270 --> 00:10:12,440
pretty quickly that you can't be

305
00:10:12,440 --> 00:10:14,600
everywhere at once which is why it's so

306
00:10:14,600 --> 00:10:15,650
vitally important that we establish

307
00:10:15,650 --> 00:10:18,470
principles so unless you've got one of

308
00:10:18,470 --> 00:10:20,300
those crazy time-turner things the

309
00:10:20,300 --> 00:10:21,560
reality is you're not going to be

310
00:10:21,560 --> 00:10:23,180
involved in every single decision that's

311
00:10:23,180 --> 00:10:23,959
okay

312
00:10:23,959 --> 00:10:26,450
we absolutely must empower our teams we

313
00:10:26,450 --> 00:10:28,430
don't want to be the bottleneck it's

314
00:10:28,430 --> 00:10:30,110
important for us to distribute

315
00:10:30,110 --> 00:10:33,200
decision-making across our teams now the

316
00:10:33,200 --> 00:10:34,910
scary part here is you've got to let

317
00:10:34,910 --> 00:10:37,670
them do their thing and so how do we

318
00:10:37,670 --> 00:10:38,990
make sure they're making good decisions

319
00:10:38,990 --> 00:10:41,990
well we have to establish principles or

320
00:10:41,990 --> 00:10:44,480
guardrails or guideposts or more stars

321
00:10:44,480 --> 00:10:46,370
whatever you want to call them or

322
00:10:46,370 --> 00:10:48,860
ultimately trying to do is create an

323
00:10:48,860 --> 00:10:50,750
environment within which our projects

324
00:10:50,750 --> 00:10:53,390
can thrive now how do I know if people

325
00:10:53,390 --> 00:10:55,070
are actually doing what I'm asking them

326
00:10:55,070 --> 00:10:57,440
to do well that's where this concept of

327
00:10:57,440 --> 00:11:00,200
fitness functions comes from at some

328
00:11:00,200 --> 00:11:03,350
point in your educational career someone

329
00:11:03,350 --> 00:11:05,089
taught you the second

330
00:11:05,089 --> 00:11:07,579
of thermodynamics which I refer to as

331
00:11:07,579 --> 00:11:10,399
the teenagers bedroom the universe for

332
00:11:10,399 --> 00:11:12,439
better or worse wants to be disordered

333
00:11:12,439 --> 00:11:14,959
sadly software is not immune from this

334
00:11:14,959 --> 00:11:16,489
everyone of you at some point in your

335
00:11:16,489 --> 00:11:18,649
career has started on a new project

336
00:11:18,649 --> 00:11:21,049
you're like oh thank god this time we're

337
00:11:21,049 --> 00:11:23,569
gonna do it right and six months later

338
00:11:23,569 --> 00:11:24,829
you're tearing out your hair going why

339
00:11:24,829 --> 00:11:26,509
did we cross the streams how did we end

340
00:11:26,509 --> 00:11:28,219
up in the same place we were before it's

341
00:11:28,219 --> 00:11:29,839
it's just the inevitable reality of

342
00:11:29,839 --> 00:11:32,359
software as architects we go through

343
00:11:32,359 --> 00:11:34,399
this effort to establish an architecture

344
00:11:34,399 --> 00:11:35,809
and we don't spend enough time thinking

345
00:11:35,809 --> 00:11:38,149
about how to maintain it and this is

346
00:11:38,149 --> 00:11:39,679
especially important because you can't

347
00:11:39,679 --> 00:11:41,269
spend every minute of every day with

348
00:11:41,269 --> 00:11:43,129
every single one of your projects so how

349
00:11:43,129 --> 00:11:44,569
do I make sure teams are making good

350
00:11:44,569 --> 00:11:47,269
decisions realizing of course that my

351
00:11:47,269 --> 00:11:48,739
ability to predict the future is not

352
00:11:48,739 --> 00:11:49,609
good

353
00:11:49,609 --> 00:11:52,429
now the best we can do frankly is study

354
00:11:52,429 --> 00:11:53,839
history there's no getting around that

355
00:11:53,839 --> 00:11:55,069
that's an important part of this

356
00:11:55,069 --> 00:11:57,919
equation now I will argue around the

357
00:11:57,919 --> 00:11:59,389
edges on this we can't predict the

358
00:11:59,389 --> 00:12:00,829
future because there is one thing I feel

359
00:12:00,829 --> 00:12:02,499
pretty confident in and that's change

360
00:12:02,499 --> 00:12:04,819
pretty comfortable saying that a few

361
00:12:04,819 --> 00:12:05,779
years from now things are going to be

362
00:12:05,779 --> 00:12:08,479
different than they are today which is a

363
00:12:08,479 --> 00:12:10,249
bit of a conundrum because we typically

364
00:12:10,249 --> 00:12:12,139
define architecture as the decisions

365
00:12:12,139 --> 00:12:13,879
that are hard to change the decisions we

366
00:12:13,879 --> 00:12:16,249
wish we got right but I know things are

367
00:12:16,249 --> 00:12:18,049
going to change and isn't this

368
00:12:18,049 --> 00:12:22,129
ultimately anti agile which is why a lot

369
00:12:22,129 --> 00:12:23,569
of companies have said well you know

370
00:12:23,569 --> 00:12:25,159
we're agile we don't have architects

371
00:12:25,159 --> 00:12:26,959
every time I hear this and I've heard

372
00:12:26,959 --> 00:12:29,059
this a lot I have to kind of bite my

373
00:12:29,059 --> 00:12:31,309
tongue because the reality is it doesn't

374
00:12:31,309 --> 00:12:33,019
matter what you've got for titles or

375
00:12:33,019 --> 00:12:35,209
roles you've certainly got people making

376
00:12:35,209 --> 00:12:38,239
architectural decisions I hope for your

377
00:12:38,239 --> 00:12:40,249
sake they're making good ones don't

378
00:12:40,249 --> 00:12:43,369
worry you'll know in a year or two I had

379
00:12:43,369 --> 00:12:44,809
a student a couple years ago who told me

380
00:12:44,809 --> 00:12:46,189
that her application had four different

381
00:12:46,189 --> 00:12:47,749
UI frameworks baked into it at this

382
00:12:47,749 --> 00:12:49,909
point in its career and she said yeah

383
00:12:49,909 --> 00:12:51,349
you know we don't have any architects in

384
00:12:51,349 --> 00:12:52,639
my company no that's kind of why I'm

385
00:12:52,639 --> 00:12:53,719
here I'm actually trying to learn how to

386
00:12:53,719 --> 00:12:55,609
be an architect and what that means and

387
00:12:55,609 --> 00:12:57,139
and you know but we don't have any

388
00:12:57,139 --> 00:12:59,209
architects and yeah well that's part of

389
00:12:59,209 --> 00:13:00,649
the problem here and you kind of need to

390
00:13:00,649 --> 00:13:01,939
have an adult in the room willing to

391
00:13:01,939 --> 00:13:03,319
stand up and say hang on guys I don't

392
00:13:03,319 --> 00:13:04,999
think we need a third framework and

393
00:13:04,999 --> 00:13:06,439
please the fourth one is when someone

394
00:13:06,439 --> 00:13:08,659
should have flipped a table so what do

395
00:13:08,659 --> 00:13:10,939
we do about that well we could change

396
00:13:10,939 --> 00:13:13,159
our assumptions now it turns out Martin

397
00:13:13,159 --> 00:13:14,569
is a pretty smart guy I think this is

398
00:13:14,569 --> 00:13:16,069
pretty good advice build for what's in

399
00:13:16,069 --> 00:13:16,879
front of you today

400
00:13:16,879 --> 00:13:19,350
choose technologies that can evolve

401
00:13:19,350 --> 00:13:21,630
if all of one use cases time that makes

402
00:13:21,630 --> 00:13:25,230
sense and so this is part of this theory

403
00:13:25,230 --> 00:13:27,420
now behind evolutionary architectures

404
00:13:27,420 --> 00:13:29,339
which says let's design architectures

405
00:13:29,339 --> 00:13:32,160
that expect change you know and this

406
00:13:32,160 --> 00:13:33,870
this book has been in pretty influential

407
00:13:33,870 --> 00:13:36,060
for me and I'm sure for many others and

408
00:13:36,060 --> 00:13:37,680
one of the bits I love in here is this

409
00:13:37,680 --> 00:13:39,149
evolutionary architecture supports

410
00:13:39,149 --> 00:13:41,940
guided incremental change guided

411
00:13:41,940 --> 00:13:43,529
incremental change that's we're shooting

412
00:13:43,529 --> 00:13:45,540
for here now to be clear some

413
00:13:45,540 --> 00:13:47,399
architectures are more evolvable than

414
00:13:47,399 --> 00:13:48,959
others a lot of people have gone down

415
00:13:48,959 --> 00:13:51,209
the microservices path and went oh my

416
00:13:51,209 --> 00:13:54,149
gosh my call tree looks really bad you

417
00:13:54,149 --> 00:13:55,620
know there's a reason these are called

418
00:13:55,620 --> 00:13:58,170
Deathstar architectures but maybe we can

419
00:13:58,170 --> 00:13:59,940
change our approach a little bit and we

420
00:13:59,940 --> 00:14:02,160
can deploy components and turn features

421
00:14:02,160 --> 00:14:04,170
on and off with toggles and we can

422
00:14:04,170 --> 00:14:05,970
change more incrementally we can

423
00:14:05,970 --> 00:14:08,130
actually use hypothesis driven

424
00:14:08,130 --> 00:14:10,740
development but that again puts us as

425
00:14:10,740 --> 00:14:12,480
architects in this conundrum of how do

426
00:14:12,480 --> 00:14:14,339
we know that this architecture as it

427
00:14:14,339 --> 00:14:15,990
evolves as it changes is still meeting

428
00:14:15,990 --> 00:14:17,850
our needs how do we know if some

429
00:14:17,850 --> 00:14:19,470
refactoring some new feature hasn't

430
00:14:19,470 --> 00:14:21,089
violated some important part of our

431
00:14:21,089 --> 00:14:23,310
architecture that's where the idea of

432
00:14:23,310 --> 00:14:25,380
fitness functions comes from now this

433
00:14:25,380 --> 00:14:26,430
comes right out of evolutionary

434
00:14:26,430 --> 00:14:28,200
computing which says fundamentally is

435
00:14:28,200 --> 00:14:30,329
this mutation a success are we closer to

436
00:14:30,329 --> 00:14:32,940
or further from our goal for us as

437
00:14:32,940 --> 00:14:34,350
architects this is all about protecting

438
00:14:34,350 --> 00:14:36,149
the illah T's and balancing these

439
00:14:36,149 --> 00:14:38,610
trade-offs and one of the things I love

440
00:14:38,610 --> 00:14:40,560
about thinking of through Fitness

441
00:14:40,560 --> 00:14:42,240
function is it gives you an opportunity

442
00:14:42,240 --> 00:14:43,860
to capture and preserve these key

443
00:14:43,860 --> 00:14:45,810
architectural characteristics that are

444
00:14:45,810 --> 00:14:47,970
important now you can look at this

445
00:14:47,970 --> 00:14:49,860
ultimately as a set of tests that we

446
00:14:49,860 --> 00:14:50,970
execute to make sure that our

447
00:14:50,970 --> 00:14:52,290
architecture is still meeting our needs

448
00:14:52,290 --> 00:14:54,720
as the application evolves and grows and

449
00:14:54,720 --> 00:14:57,870
changes so as we refactor as we add new

450
00:14:57,870 --> 00:15:00,300
pieces are we closer to or further from

451
00:15:00,300 --> 00:15:02,250
our goals are we still aligned to our

452
00:15:02,250 --> 00:15:04,350
objectives now in a perfect world this

453
00:15:04,350 --> 00:15:06,450
is all automated but there's still gonna

454
00:15:06,450 --> 00:15:08,730
be some manual verifications sorry I'll

455
00:15:08,730 --> 00:15:10,560
run you through some examples very

456
00:15:10,560 --> 00:15:12,839
quickly it might decide performance

457
00:15:12,839 --> 00:15:15,029
matter so all service calls must respond

458
00:15:15,029 --> 00:15:16,760
within an average of 100 milliseconds

459
00:15:16,760 --> 00:15:18,839
you might want your code base to be

460
00:15:18,839 --> 00:15:20,190
relatively simple so you want to keep

461
00:15:20,190 --> 00:15:21,990
your cyclomatic complexity below a low

462
00:15:21,990 --> 00:15:24,300
single-digit number you probably don't

463
00:15:24,300 --> 00:15:25,980
want to have cyclic dependencies you

464
00:15:25,980 --> 00:15:27,449
might care about directionality of

465
00:15:27,449 --> 00:15:28,589
importance maybe you've got a fairly

466
00:15:28,589 --> 00:15:30,630
young staff and some of them haven't

467
00:15:30,630 --> 00:15:31,920
quite figured this out and so you know

468
00:15:31,920 --> 00:15:33,100
it's totally

469
00:15:33,100 --> 00:15:36,100
if persistence and web include util but

470
00:15:36,100 --> 00:15:37,570
if we happen to go the other way and

471
00:15:37,570 --> 00:15:39,400
someone pulls web into util we'd like to

472
00:15:39,400 --> 00:15:41,860
break the build on that we can use

473
00:15:41,860 --> 00:15:44,500
consumer-driven contracts as a way of

474
00:15:44,500 --> 00:15:47,529
maintaining the contract that we are

475
00:15:47,529 --> 00:15:49,779
giving to our consumers so that when we

476
00:15:49,779 --> 00:15:54,100
make changes we don't under

477
00:15:54,100 --> 00:15:57,070
unintentionally break a consumer spring

478
00:15:57,070 --> 00:15:58,480
cloud contract helps with a lot of this

479
00:15:58,480 --> 00:15:59,890
there are actually testing tools now

480
00:15:59,890 --> 00:16:01,270
that we can apply to architecture

481
00:16:01,270 --> 00:16:03,130
there's our qunit there's also a dotnet

482
00:16:03,130 --> 00:16:05,529
variant of this there scientist from the

483
00:16:05,529 --> 00:16:06,670
github folks there's all sorts of

484
00:16:06,670 --> 00:16:07,930
interesting tools that are starting to

485
00:16:07,930 --> 00:16:10,870
appear in this space we might look at

486
00:16:10,870 --> 00:16:12,970
average and maximum response times we

487
00:16:12,970 --> 00:16:15,910
might look at scalability across number

488
00:16:15,910 --> 00:16:17,770
of users number of requests we might

489
00:16:17,770 --> 00:16:19,390
look at number of timeouts number of

490
00:16:19,390 --> 00:16:21,700
application faults I teach a graduate

491
00:16:21,700 --> 00:16:23,980
school class and last semester one of my

492
00:16:23,980 --> 00:16:25,390
students said hey I want to look at what

493
00:16:25,390 --> 00:16:27,040
happens when we get closer to the next

494
00:16:27,040 --> 00:16:29,500
pricing tier with our cloud provider you

495
00:16:29,500 --> 00:16:30,940
might decide that if I have a hard

496
00:16:30,940 --> 00:16:33,010
failure of an application a new instance

497
00:16:33,010 --> 00:16:35,230
will spin up now the challenge in a lot

498
00:16:35,230 --> 00:16:36,640
of these situations is we want to alert

499
00:16:36,640 --> 00:16:38,020
when something goes out AB and we need

500
00:16:38,020 --> 00:16:39,220
to have some good monitoring in place

501
00:16:39,220 --> 00:16:41,770
that's a topic for another day we're

502
00:16:41,770 --> 00:16:43,089
probably going to need to introduce a

503
00:16:43,089 --> 00:16:44,920
certain amount of chaos into the system

504
00:16:44,920 --> 00:16:46,600
as well because we're not gonna think of

505
00:16:46,600 --> 00:16:48,130
everything so we're gonna need a little

506
00:16:48,130 --> 00:16:49,890
bit of this to help keep us on our toes

507
00:16:49,890 --> 00:16:51,910
what are things I absolutely love about

508
00:16:51,910 --> 00:16:54,220
fitness functions is they remind us of

509
00:16:54,220 --> 00:16:56,050
what's important in our architecture and

510
00:16:56,050 --> 00:16:58,420
they inform us about the trade-offs that

511
00:16:58,420 --> 00:17:00,610
we're making now obviously you want to

512
00:17:00,610 --> 00:17:03,070
identify as many of these as early in

513
00:17:03,070 --> 00:17:05,650
the process as you can the discussion

514
00:17:05,650 --> 00:17:06,869
around them is just invaluable

515
00:17:06,869 --> 00:17:08,410
understanding the system and

516
00:17:08,410 --> 00:17:09,819
understanding what matters they help you

517
00:17:09,819 --> 00:17:10,810
prioritize

518
00:17:10,810 --> 00:17:12,550
they might change how you actually

519
00:17:12,550 --> 00:17:14,290
architect the system how you break

520
00:17:14,290 --> 00:17:16,270
things up now obviously you're not going

521
00:17:16,270 --> 00:17:18,220
to know everything up front an awful lot

522
00:17:18,220 --> 00:17:19,929
of things will emerge as the system

523
00:17:19,929 --> 00:17:22,420
grows and evolves we want to do as good

524
00:17:22,420 --> 00:17:24,339
a job as we can a figure this out as

525
00:17:24,339 --> 00:17:26,890
early as we can this is a great thing to

526
00:17:26,890 --> 00:17:28,810
have visible as much as possible in the

527
00:17:28,810 --> 00:17:31,240
proverbial project room you need to

528
00:17:31,240 --> 00:17:33,190
review them on a regular basis and ask

529
00:17:33,190 --> 00:17:35,860
yourself is it still relevant are there

530
00:17:35,860 --> 00:17:37,679
new dimensions that we need to track

531
00:17:37,679 --> 00:17:40,540
other better ways of us actually

532
00:17:40,540 --> 00:17:41,950
tracking and measuring these things I

533
00:17:41,950 --> 00:17:44,290
would do that at least annually if not

534
00:17:44,290 --> 00:17:45,080
you know

535
00:17:45,080 --> 00:17:46,429
more frequently it just sort of depends

536
00:17:46,429 --> 00:17:48,620
an awful lot on where you're at in your

537
00:17:48,620 --> 00:17:50,269
company you know where you're at in the

538
00:17:50,269 --> 00:17:53,299
project's lifecycle so I'm gonna shift

539
00:17:53,299 --> 00:17:55,070
gears a little bit here and talk about

540
00:17:55,070 --> 00:17:57,019
how we deal with distributor to

541
00:17:57,019 --> 00:18:00,230
expertise in these organizations nobody

542
00:18:00,230 --> 00:18:03,409
has a monopoly on the knowledge and one

543
00:18:03,409 --> 00:18:05,510
of the challenges we face as we grow and

544
00:18:05,510 --> 00:18:06,799
expand and have people spread all over

545
00:18:06,799 --> 00:18:08,990
the place how do you recognize it how do

546
00:18:08,990 --> 00:18:11,690
you encourage it one of the approaches

547
00:18:11,690 --> 00:18:13,519
that I've seen is a center of excellence

548
00:18:13,519 --> 00:18:16,399
or a community of practice it's same

549
00:18:16,399 --> 00:18:18,679
basic concept you know phrasing you know

550
00:18:18,679 --> 00:18:20,059
however you want to call it's fine

551
00:18:20,059 --> 00:18:22,100
this could be built around a fairly

552
00:18:22,100 --> 00:18:24,320
broad topic it can also be more narrow

553
00:18:24,320 --> 00:18:25,880
it just depends on what you're trying to

554
00:18:25,880 --> 00:18:27,620
do you know there's there's no limit how

555
00:18:27,620 --> 00:18:29,720
many of these you can have in the ones

556
00:18:29,720 --> 00:18:30,980
that I've been a part of they typically

557
00:18:30,980 --> 00:18:33,049
meet monthly and ultimately what they do

558
00:18:33,049 --> 00:18:35,210
is give you a forum where a group of

559
00:18:35,210 --> 00:18:36,679
interested people can come together and

560
00:18:36,679 --> 00:18:38,870
talk around what's happening in our

561
00:18:38,870 --> 00:18:40,850
organization about this thing whether

562
00:18:40,850 --> 00:18:43,639
that's cloud computing or you know

563
00:18:43,639 --> 00:18:45,500
mobile development or JavaScript

564
00:18:45,500 --> 00:18:46,929
frameworks or whatever makes you happy

565
00:18:46,929 --> 00:18:50,809
it's a fantastic venue to have 15 20 30

566
00:18:50,809 --> 00:18:52,789
minute presentations 45 minute

567
00:18:52,789 --> 00:18:54,769
presentations I've seen everything from

568
00:18:54,769 --> 00:18:57,260
just a real quick 5 minute overview to

569
00:18:57,260 --> 00:18:59,269
you know what this is an entire meeting

570
00:18:59,269 --> 00:19:01,490
devoted to a presentation on this topic

571
00:19:01,490 --> 00:19:04,100
I would strongly advise you to make sure

572
00:19:04,100 --> 00:19:05,990
that you have time for people to talk to

573
00:19:05,990 --> 00:19:07,909
one another to give people a chance to

574
00:19:07,909 --> 00:19:09,529
bounce ideas off one another get

575
00:19:09,529 --> 00:19:11,929
feedback get advice share lessons

576
00:19:11,929 --> 00:19:14,480
learned this is where we start to build

577
00:19:14,480 --> 00:19:17,330
these relationships when I first became

578
00:19:17,330 --> 00:19:18,620
an architect one of the things that I

579
00:19:18,620 --> 00:19:21,500
was concerned about was there's so much

580
00:19:21,500 --> 00:19:23,419
breadth in our space I can't possibly

581
00:19:23,419 --> 00:19:25,610
know the answer to everything and one of

582
00:19:25,610 --> 00:19:27,110
my peers took me aside one day and said

583
00:19:27,110 --> 00:19:28,159
you know Nate you can't know everything

584
00:19:28,159 --> 00:19:30,950
that's impossible the key thing to being

585
00:19:30,950 --> 00:19:32,179
a good architect is knowing where to go

586
00:19:32,179 --> 00:19:34,580
to get the your questions answered and

587
00:19:34,580 --> 00:19:37,100
that's around building relationships you

588
00:19:37,100 --> 00:19:38,840
know so who in this organization can

589
00:19:38,840 --> 00:19:41,389
help me with this I was talking to a

590
00:19:41,389 --> 00:19:44,750
gentleman from another company and he

591
00:19:44,750 --> 00:19:45,980
told me that in their organization they

592
00:19:45,980 --> 00:19:47,899
have a guild model where they

593
00:19:47,899 --> 00:19:50,149
essentially form groups around various

594
00:19:50,149 --> 00:19:52,639
topic areas and it's the recognized

595
00:19:52,639 --> 00:19:55,039
experts within the organization about

596
00:19:55,039 --> 00:19:56,100
that topic

597
00:19:56,100 --> 00:19:58,730
now these are sort of organic

598
00:19:58,730 --> 00:20:02,130
self-organizing kinds of things seem to

599
00:20:02,130 --> 00:20:04,320
imply there's kind of a nomination phase

600
00:20:04,320 --> 00:20:06,390
or else people are like tapping other

601
00:20:06,390 --> 00:20:07,290
people on the shoulders saying hey I'd

602
00:20:07,290 --> 00:20:08,670
like you to join our guild I know you

603
00:20:08,670 --> 00:20:11,430
know a lot about this meet on whatever

604
00:20:11,430 --> 00:20:13,950
cadence works maybe that's every other

605
00:20:13,950 --> 00:20:15,630
week maybe that's every other month it

606
00:20:15,630 --> 00:20:18,300
just depends again in the organizations

607
00:20:18,300 --> 00:20:19,380
I've talked to about this particular

608
00:20:19,380 --> 00:20:21,360
concept there's usually some kind of an

609
00:20:21,360 --> 00:20:23,310
email list slack channel where they can

610
00:20:23,310 --> 00:20:25,650
talk to one another get advice feedback

611
00:20:25,650 --> 00:20:27,930
etc you know and then there's also

612
00:20:27,930 --> 00:20:30,510
usually kind of a guild specific

613
00:20:30,510 --> 00:20:32,250
discussion mechanism where the guild

614
00:20:32,250 --> 00:20:35,430
members can chat you know plan hey we

615
00:20:35,430 --> 00:20:36,960
should put out a presentation on this

616
00:20:36,960 --> 00:20:38,280
thing I'm getting a lot of questions

617
00:20:38,280 --> 00:20:41,220
about this a lot of benefits that come

618
00:20:41,220 --> 00:20:42,960
out of this concept again regardless of

619
00:20:42,960 --> 00:20:44,520
whether you call it guild or community

620
00:20:44,520 --> 00:20:46,140
practice or a Senate center of

621
00:20:46,140 --> 00:20:48,420
excellence when I was a part of these in

622
00:20:48,420 --> 00:20:50,640
my previous organization this is where a

623
00:20:50,640 --> 00:20:52,410
lot of our best practices and standards

624
00:20:52,410 --> 00:20:54,750
would grow from our reference

625
00:20:54,750 --> 00:20:56,190
implementations would usually come out

626
00:20:56,190 --> 00:20:57,990
of these groups this is where we did a

627
00:20:57,990 --> 00:21:00,660
lot of internal evangelism so cloud

628
00:21:00,660 --> 00:21:02,550
architect was my my last gig in my

629
00:21:02,550 --> 00:21:03,840
previous company and that was a huge

630
00:21:03,840 --> 00:21:05,880
part of my job was basically just doing

631
00:21:05,880 --> 00:21:08,700
these cloud 101 201 301 presentations

632
00:21:08,700 --> 00:21:11,250
and a fair amount of internal consulting

633
00:21:11,250 --> 00:21:14,160
to help people adjust to this new

634
00:21:14,160 --> 00:21:15,120
reality

635
00:21:15,120 --> 00:21:17,160
there also tends to be a fair amount of

636
00:21:17,160 --> 00:21:19,410
developer and Nabal MIT like activities

637
00:21:19,410 --> 00:21:21,600
Wow we've got all these new tools and

638
00:21:21,600 --> 00:21:23,730
technologies and software and approaches

639
00:21:23,730 --> 00:21:25,350
you know somebody has to kind of wade

640
00:21:25,350 --> 00:21:26,730
through that and figure out what makes

641
00:21:26,730 --> 00:21:29,520
sense for us it's a fantastic way of

642
00:21:29,520 --> 00:21:31,950
influencing the organization as well by

643
00:21:31,950 --> 00:21:34,650
the way speaking of that I'm a huge fan

644
00:21:34,650 --> 00:21:36,150
of the technology radar this is an

645
00:21:36,150 --> 00:21:37,440
artifact that comes out of thought works

646
00:21:37,440 --> 00:21:40,170
a few times a year I love it as one of

647
00:21:40,170 --> 00:21:42,900
the most powerful visuals we have and it

648
00:21:42,900 --> 00:21:45,630
gives you a grill I think a very easy

649
00:21:45,630 --> 00:21:47,760
way of seeing the trends in technology

650
00:21:47,760 --> 00:21:50,760
what's coming what's dying ultimately

651
00:21:50,760 --> 00:21:52,800
where should we be investing our time

652
00:21:52,800 --> 00:21:55,230
and energy and so I just pull this out

653
00:21:55,230 --> 00:21:57,450
of one of the recent radars and kind of

654
00:21:57,450 --> 00:21:59,790
see where things are landing inside of

655
00:21:59,790 --> 00:22:02,190
these various rings a huge fan of these

656
00:22:02,190 --> 00:22:03,600
you know their basic concept here is

657
00:22:03,600 --> 00:22:05,850
hold assess trial adopt on the way out

658
00:22:05,850 --> 00:22:09,240
on the way in and so a hold technology

659
00:22:09,240 --> 00:22:09,960
something that's fair

660
00:22:09,960 --> 00:22:11,880
early it's either something that's very

661
00:22:11,880 --> 00:22:15,149
new or it's kind of on its way out so

662
00:22:15,149 --> 00:22:17,279
don't start a new project their next

663
00:22:17,279 --> 00:22:19,620
level in we're doing demos we're kind of

664
00:22:19,620 --> 00:22:22,140
figure wearing it suitable next level

665
00:22:22,140 --> 00:22:23,610
and we're gonna do some pilot projects

666
00:22:23,610 --> 00:22:25,770
and once we get to the adopt ring you

667
00:22:25,770 --> 00:22:27,870
should be using this now for more

668
00:22:27,870 --> 00:22:29,309
thought worker told me the whole goal of

669
00:22:29,309 --> 00:22:30,720
that ring is if you're not using this at

670
00:22:30,720 --> 00:22:31,890
the pub if you're not using this

671
00:22:31,890 --> 00:22:33,149
technology I'm gonna make fun of you at

672
00:22:33,149 --> 00:22:35,970
the pub tonight modify the language for

673
00:22:35,970 --> 00:22:37,200
your company I actually built one of

674
00:22:37,200 --> 00:22:39,200
these at one of my previous

675
00:22:39,200 --> 00:22:41,340
organizations and we actually changed

676
00:22:41,340 --> 00:22:43,289
the language to contain assess early

677
00:22:43,289 --> 00:22:44,940
adopter generally available because that

678
00:22:44,940 --> 00:22:46,380
just fit better with a lot of our

679
00:22:46,380 --> 00:22:48,090
roadmaps you know the language is

680
00:22:48,090 --> 00:22:50,640
fungible quadrants we're looking at

681
00:22:50,640 --> 00:22:52,440
techniques tools platforms languages

682
00:22:52,440 --> 00:22:54,779
again modify for your needs

683
00:22:54,779 --> 00:22:57,360
I'm a huge fan of doing one of these for

684
00:22:57,360 --> 00:22:58,529
your company I know this is something

685
00:22:58,529 --> 00:23:00,690
neil has talked about for years it's not

686
00:23:00,690 --> 00:23:02,940
that complicated now it's very

687
00:23:02,940 --> 00:23:04,980
straightforward thing to do I strongly

688
00:23:04,980 --> 00:23:06,390
recommend it you just get the right

689
00:23:06,390 --> 00:23:07,409
people in the room with some sticky

690
00:23:07,409 --> 00:23:09,210
notes you've probably got some existing

691
00:23:09,210 --> 00:23:10,649
documentation it's probably not very

692
00:23:10,649 --> 00:23:13,830
good make a rough pass circulate it get

693
00:23:13,830 --> 00:23:15,840
some feedback iterate once you feel

694
00:23:15,840 --> 00:23:17,669
pretty comfortable start sharing it with

695
00:23:17,669 --> 00:23:18,990
people and then eventually you can

696
00:23:18,990 --> 00:23:21,059
formalize it you can actually get the

697
00:23:21,059 --> 00:23:25,169
the radar code from thought works if you

698
00:23:25,169 --> 00:23:26,640
actually want to use that I know a

699
00:23:26,640 --> 00:23:27,990
couple organizations back to help one

700
00:23:27,990 --> 00:23:29,309
organization with this a couple years

701
00:23:29,309 --> 00:23:31,350
ago they have their own internal radar

702
00:23:31,350 --> 00:23:33,360
that they use built off of the thought

703
00:23:33,360 --> 00:23:35,760
works codebase what I love about it is

704
00:23:35,760 --> 00:23:37,770
it works up down and across you know

705
00:23:37,770 --> 00:23:39,390
there's not a lot in our organization

706
00:23:39,390 --> 00:23:41,340
that works with business folks IT folks

707
00:23:41,340 --> 00:23:43,770
in different levels it's not just an

708
00:23:43,770 --> 00:23:45,179
artifact for developers it's just an

709
00:23:45,179 --> 00:23:47,580
artifact for for management it works for

710
00:23:47,580 --> 00:23:49,169
pretty much everybody in the company and

711
00:23:49,169 --> 00:23:50,610
that's a very powerful thing for us to

712
00:23:50,610 --> 00:23:51,539
have a tool kit

713
00:23:51,539 --> 00:23:53,789
I also recommend doing this for yourself

714
00:23:53,789 --> 00:23:55,350
by the way you know when you're trying

715
00:23:55,350 --> 00:23:56,760
to figure out you know what what stuff

716
00:23:56,760 --> 00:23:58,080
should I play with this year where do I

717
00:23:58,080 --> 00:24:00,779
want to spend my development time use

718
00:24:00,779 --> 00:24:02,640
this as a way of guiding you and and

719
00:24:02,640 --> 00:24:04,110
ultimately what you try to do here is

720
00:24:04,110 --> 00:24:05,520
portfolio theory you know if you think

721
00:24:05,520 --> 00:24:06,750
about the way most of us have our

722
00:24:06,750 --> 00:24:09,690
retirement investment invested it's all

723
00:24:09,690 --> 00:24:10,950
about trying to get as much money as

724
00:24:10,950 --> 00:24:12,090
possible into something that's pretty

725
00:24:12,090 --> 00:24:14,210
solid and returns nothing super

726
00:24:14,210 --> 00:24:15,840
extravagant but you know it's going to

727
00:24:15,840 --> 00:24:17,820
be be dependable and then some of your

728
00:24:17,820 --> 00:24:19,320
money might be a little more high

729
00:24:19,320 --> 00:24:20,850
high reward it's the same with tech

730
00:24:20,850 --> 00:24:22,440
skills you know there's certain tech

731
00:24:22,440 --> 00:24:24,030
skills that we all know are valuable and

732
00:24:24,030 --> 00:24:25,650
some yeah this could be a flyer maybe

733
00:24:25,650 --> 00:24:27,930
I'll play with it the other thing I'd

734
00:24:27,930 --> 00:24:29,340
like to say is a lot of companies do

735
00:24:29,340 --> 00:24:30,690
internal conferences I've helped out

736
00:24:30,690 --> 00:24:32,340
with several E's over the last few years

737
00:24:32,340 --> 00:24:34,530
I know a lot of organizations have their

738
00:24:34,530 --> 00:24:36,060
own internal events that can go from

739
00:24:36,060 --> 00:24:38,070
anything just from a few hours all the

740
00:24:38,070 --> 00:24:40,230
way to a few days it just depends on how

741
00:24:40,230 --> 00:24:42,000
much you want to bite off having

742
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:44,250
organized a few of these for my previous

743
00:24:44,250 --> 00:24:46,560
company a lot of effort goes into it to

744
00:24:46,560 --> 00:24:48,000
say the least so don't don't think this

745
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:49,410
is going to happen in spare cycles it's

746
00:24:49,410 --> 00:24:51,570
gonna take some serious investment in

747
00:24:51,570 --> 00:24:53,970
time I'm also a fan of this sort of

748
00:24:53,970 --> 00:24:56,460
architectural Roundtable concept

749
00:24:56,460 --> 00:24:57,960
someone was telling me about the way

750
00:24:57,960 --> 00:24:58,980
they do it in their company and

751
00:24:58,980 --> 00:25:00,510
basically what they do is I have a group

752
00:25:00,510 --> 00:25:02,730
of people that gets together weekly they

753
00:25:02,730 --> 00:25:04,800
sort of propose ideas over slack you

754
00:25:04,800 --> 00:25:05,700
know hey what do you guys want us to

755
00:25:05,700 --> 00:25:07,410
talk about are there any presentations

756
00:25:07,410 --> 00:25:09,000
you want us to do and then they go ahead

757
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:11,580
and share that out so take advantage of

758
00:25:11,580 --> 00:25:13,560
that existing expertise don't be afraid

759
00:25:13,560 --> 00:25:15,450
to crowdsource you know use github pull

760
00:25:15,450 --> 00:25:17,640
request whatever works for you you know

761
00:25:17,640 --> 00:25:19,650
the beauty of this is experiment try it

762
00:25:19,650 --> 00:25:22,860
out see what works all right I'm gonna

763
00:25:22,860 --> 00:25:26,130
go ahead and stop that and see if I have

764
00:25:26,130 --> 00:25:28,530
any questions hiding in the channel here

765
00:25:28,530 --> 00:25:32,130
and Brian forgive me I'm not sure where

766
00:25:32,130 --> 00:25:33,990
to look for questions no there's no

767
00:25:33,990 --> 00:25:36,360
problem I I have you covered already I

768
00:25:36,360 --> 00:25:38,550
mean and there there are not many

769
00:25:38,550 --> 00:25:40,320
questions at this point I've got one

770
00:25:40,320 --> 00:25:42,930
question in what is the best way for

771
00:25:42,930 --> 00:25:47,490
architects to keep sorry to keep in the

772
00:25:47,490 --> 00:25:50,420
know I think this gentleman is not

773
00:25:50,420 --> 00:25:53,520
natively English but sustained with

774
00:25:53,520 --> 00:25:56,790
technology yeah about about them about

775
00:25:56,790 --> 00:26:00,060
the breed computing it seems like

776
00:26:00,060 --> 00:26:03,630
drinking from a firehose these days well

777
00:26:03,630 --> 00:26:06,330
I would say that's true of technology in

778
00:26:06,330 --> 00:26:08,160
general you know I mean every time you

779
00:26:08,160 --> 00:26:10,530
turn around these new languages new

780
00:26:10,530 --> 00:26:12,210
techniques new technologies this is

781
00:26:12,210 --> 00:26:13,350
something I've spent a fair amount of

782
00:26:13,350 --> 00:26:15,720
time thinking about you know it's it's

783
00:26:15,720 --> 00:26:17,100
hard you know you can't keep up with

784
00:26:17,100 --> 00:26:19,260
everything and you have to sort of pick

785
00:26:19,260 --> 00:26:20,850
and choose the areas that are

786
00:26:20,850 --> 00:26:22,800
interesting to you know what are what

787
00:26:22,800 --> 00:26:23,940
are the things you're passionate about

788
00:26:23,940 --> 00:26:25,800
is if you don't have passion for it

789
00:26:25,800 --> 00:26:27,090
you're not gonna take the time out of

790
00:26:27,090 --> 00:26:28,500
your day you're you're gonna find other

791
00:26:28,500 --> 00:26:29,640
things so I'll give you a perfect

792
00:26:29,640 --> 00:26:31,650
example for myself I am NOT a database

793
00:26:31,650 --> 00:26:33,510
person all right I I know just

794
00:26:33,510 --> 00:26:35,580
enough sequel that they don't let me

795
00:26:35,580 --> 00:26:38,190
write sequel okay and you know my most

796
00:26:38,190 --> 00:26:39,810
of my career has been front-end work you

797
00:26:39,810 --> 00:26:41,460
know I get the data to the server and

798
00:26:41,460 --> 00:26:43,020
then I don't know squirrels put it in

799
00:26:43,020 --> 00:26:45,540
trees or something happens and there's

800
00:26:45,540 --> 00:26:46,980
one in like I should really learn more

801
00:26:46,980 --> 00:26:48,600
about these know sequel databases and I

802
00:26:48,600 --> 00:26:50,370
sat down with like I think it was no

803
00:26:50,370 --> 00:26:51,870
sequel distilled or whatever and I was

804
00:26:51,870 --> 00:26:53,100
gonna like okay this is it I've got a

805
00:26:53,100 --> 00:26:54,990
Saturday I'm gonna work on this and I

806
00:26:54,990 --> 00:26:56,690
literally went and organized my soccer

807
00:26:56,690 --> 00:26:59,880
right because I'm like I just wasn't

808
00:26:59,880 --> 00:27:01,830
passionate about it and so you have to

809
00:27:01,830 --> 00:27:03,450
let your passion guide you and direct

810
00:27:03,450 --> 00:27:05,790
you these are not full-time decisions

811
00:27:05,790 --> 00:27:07,110
you know you can spend you know for the

812
00:27:07,110 --> 00:27:08,490
next two months I'm gonna go deep dive

813
00:27:08,490 --> 00:27:11,160
on JavaScript frameworks and then two

814
00:27:11,160 --> 00:27:13,290
months I'm gonna go deep dive on Kafka

815
00:27:13,290 --> 00:27:14,520
and then two months I'm gonna go deep

816
00:27:14,520 --> 00:27:15,990
dive on something and that's perfectly

817
00:27:15,990 --> 00:27:17,220
fine you know these these are not

818
00:27:17,220 --> 00:27:19,320
permanent decisions let your passion

819
00:27:19,320 --> 00:27:21,360
guide you and and remember if something

820
00:27:21,360 --> 00:27:22,770
is a big enough deal you're gonna hear

821
00:27:22,770 --> 00:27:25,050
about it's gonna bubble up and again I

822
00:27:25,050 --> 00:27:26,460
think the most important part of this

823
00:27:26,460 --> 00:27:28,290
for us as architects for Technion

824
00:27:28,290 --> 00:27:29,250
whether you're an architect or a

825
00:27:29,250 --> 00:27:31,290
principal engineer or a senior engineer

826
00:27:31,290 --> 00:27:33,210
doesn't really matter you know how do

827
00:27:33,210 --> 00:27:34,890
you keep up with the industry and then

828
00:27:34,890 --> 00:27:37,020
having some kind of a network of people

829
00:27:37,020 --> 00:27:39,510
that you can reach out to to ask about

830
00:27:39,510 --> 00:27:41,010
these more specific questions that

831
00:27:41,010 --> 00:27:42,660
you're inevitably gonna gonna run into

832
00:27:42,660 --> 00:27:44,190
you're never gonna know all the answers

833
00:27:44,190 --> 00:27:46,710
are like I completely agree very good

834
00:27:46,710 --> 00:27:48,510
very good question great question Quran

835
00:27:48,510 --> 00:27:51,390
and I've got one question for you like

836
00:27:51,390 --> 00:27:53,310
you started with the remote working

837
00:27:53,310 --> 00:27:54,810
stuff a and at the beginning of your

838
00:27:54,810 --> 00:27:56,820
presentation what do you think is the

839
00:27:56,820 --> 00:27:59,280
most difficult part of it because if I

840
00:27:59,280 --> 00:28:01,140
look at me personally I work remotely

841
00:28:01,140 --> 00:28:03,660
but I think time zones is the most

842
00:28:03,660 --> 00:28:06,330
difficult thing within remote working

843
00:28:06,330 --> 00:28:08,820
and remote disabilities yeah I would

844
00:28:08,820 --> 00:28:10,650
agree with that the time zone pieces is

845
00:28:10,650 --> 00:28:12,930
hard we I just had a meeting earlier

846
00:28:12,930 --> 00:28:15,120
this week the person who proposed it

847
00:28:15,120 --> 00:28:17,370
camera what time she originally proposed

848
00:28:17,370 --> 00:28:18,450
it for and then someone on the West

849
00:28:18,450 --> 00:28:19,920
Coast like could we please avoid West

850
00:28:19,920 --> 00:28:22,470
Coast lunch and it's like well we've got

851
00:28:22,470 --> 00:28:23,910
people in the West Coast we've got

852
00:28:23,910 --> 00:28:25,620
people in central we've got people in

853
00:28:25,620 --> 00:28:27,120
Eastern there's no way we're gonna avoid

854
00:28:27,120 --> 00:28:30,090
everyone's lunch hour and you know part

855
00:28:30,090 --> 00:28:32,460
of that's flexibility of okay I might

856
00:28:32,460 --> 00:28:34,290
have to you know quote unquote meet over

857
00:28:34,290 --> 00:28:36,780
lunch or whatever and being willing to

858
00:28:36,780 --> 00:28:39,750
spread the pain around you know so the

859
00:28:39,750 --> 00:28:41,700
tab the technology advisory board from

860
00:28:41,700 --> 00:28:44,550
flat works their global and so basically

861
00:28:44,550 --> 00:28:46,350
every third meeting or whatever it is is

862
00:28:46,350 --> 00:28:47,309
going to be you know

863
00:28:47,309 --> 00:28:48,659
a time zone that doesn't work for you

864
00:28:48,659 --> 00:28:50,970
because you can't always have one group

865
00:28:50,970 --> 00:28:52,049
of people being the ones that have to

866
00:28:52,049 --> 00:28:53,669
get up at 2:00 in the morning you know

867
00:28:53,669 --> 00:28:55,649
so distribute the pain understand that

868
00:28:55,649 --> 00:28:57,570
this part of the deal you know and just

869
00:28:57,570 --> 00:28:59,879
do your best to be be flexible with that

870
00:28:59,879 --> 00:29:01,980
and understanding of other people that

871
00:29:01,980 --> 00:29:04,320
yeah I'm not I'm not on the same clock

872
00:29:04,320 --> 00:29:06,389
as you are yeah and we're not all in the

873
00:29:06,389 --> 00:29:07,710
same body clock you know you might work

874
00:29:07,710 --> 00:29:09,179
best at 7:00 in the morning I might work

875
00:29:09,179 --> 00:29:10,799
best at 7:00 at night and you know

876
00:29:10,799 --> 00:29:13,799
that's cool yeah yeah and we do have to

877
00:29:13,799 --> 00:29:16,230
understand that things like my end of

878
00:29:16,230 --> 00:29:18,210
day is not your end of day right we need

879
00:29:18,210 --> 00:29:20,009
to did need to be you need to do it

880
00:29:20,009 --> 00:29:23,340
today and well and if we get along but

881
00:29:23,340 --> 00:29:25,080
that's that's getting used to things I

882
00:29:25,080 --> 00:29:27,049
mean if you work in the same

883
00:29:27,049 --> 00:29:29,730
geographically in the geographic area

884
00:29:29,730 --> 00:29:31,740
that you used to work like in an office

885
00:29:31,740 --> 00:29:35,190
it's it's kind of natural to work from

886
00:29:35,190 --> 00:29:38,009
4:00 it's 9:00 to 5:00 right right if

887
00:29:38,009 --> 00:29:39,419
you fall into that because you're around

888
00:29:39,419 --> 00:29:41,009
them everybody and so you all kind of

889
00:29:41,009 --> 00:29:43,470
fall into that same sort of rhythm you

890
00:29:43,470 --> 00:29:44,940
don't have that rhythm one year at home

891
00:29:44,940 --> 00:29:46,499
I would say the hardest thing about

892
00:29:46,499 --> 00:29:48,330
being at home is is making sure you have

893
00:29:48,330 --> 00:29:50,190
that separation it's so easy to get

894
00:29:50,190 --> 00:29:51,659
pulled into something and look up and go

895
00:29:51,659 --> 00:29:54,749
oh it's 7 p.m. I should probably you

896
00:29:54,749 --> 00:29:56,100
know go say hi to my family or whatever

897
00:29:56,100 --> 00:29:58,230
it's very easy to get sucked into that

898
00:29:58,230 --> 00:29:59,639
and so I think it's important to make

899
00:29:59,639 --> 00:30:01,169
sure you do have some divider lines

900
00:30:01,169 --> 00:30:01,830
there too

901
00:30:01,830 --> 00:30:05,240
I agree
