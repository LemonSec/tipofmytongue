1
00:00:00,350 --> 00:00:05,839
hey there hey doing welcome Jeffrey and

2
00:00:05,839 --> 00:00:09,179
Douglas squirrel we're gonna tell us

3
00:00:09,179 --> 00:00:12,840
about when we're frustrated how do we

4
00:00:12,840 --> 00:00:15,809
transform conversations and improve our

5
00:00:15,809 --> 00:00:19,380
culture so I'm guessing you guys have

6
00:00:19,380 --> 00:00:21,630
some slides to share that was a good

7
00:00:21,630 --> 00:00:23,760
guess now we also though we do typically

8
00:00:23,760 --> 00:00:25,140
when we do this live we have an

9
00:00:25,140 --> 00:00:27,420
interactive bit that we do with an

10
00:00:27,420 --> 00:00:30,869
audience oh we've never met sure own

11
00:00:30,869 --> 00:00:35,640
yeah okay so we were wondering if you'd

12
00:00:35,640 --> 00:00:38,280
be willing to at some point in our talk

13
00:00:38,280 --> 00:00:40,079
when we have that live interaction that

14
00:00:40,079 --> 00:00:47,460
we could ask you a couple questions some

15
00:00:47,460 --> 00:00:49,680
of the answers yes absolutely

16
00:00:49,680 --> 00:00:53,940
okay so feel free to start that Sharon

17
00:00:53,940 --> 00:00:57,449
and we'll get your slide set up yep so I

18
00:00:57,449 --> 00:00:59,280
think I should have the slide shared now

19
00:00:59,280 --> 00:01:01,739
is that are you able to see that just

20
00:01:01,739 --> 00:01:04,129
appearing there they are fantastic and

21
00:01:04,129 --> 00:01:07,110
I'm gonna have I'm gonna opt out of the

22
00:01:07,110 --> 00:01:09,119
stream and let you guys take it away

23
00:01:09,119 --> 00:01:11,430
from here but I will remind folks that

24
00:01:11,430 --> 00:01:14,220
there's a donate button and the founder

25
00:01:14,220 --> 00:01:16,140
of snick will be matching all of the

26
00:01:16,140 --> 00:01:18,080
donations until the end of the show so

27
00:01:18,080 --> 00:01:20,460
you will have definitely more impact

28
00:01:20,460 --> 00:01:22,080
with your donation from now until the

29
00:01:22,080 --> 00:01:25,590
end of the event so please do keep

00:01:25,590 --> 00:01:27,950
donating we need to find a cure for

31
00:01:27,950 --> 00:01:31,890
Kovan so I take it away folks all right

36
00:01:40,140 --> 00:01:43,350
this point I'm not one of those people I

37
00:01:43,350 --> 00:01:46,049

just a bit about who we are so my name's

45
00:01:59,840 --> 00:02:04,159
Geoff Frederick and I'm a longtime

46
00:02:04,159 --> 00:02:07,530
software executive I've spoken at DevOps

47
00:02:07,530 --> 00:02:08,910
days a few times so Peter talk in the

48
00:02:08,910 --> 00:02:10,649
DevOps track isn't minim I'm excited

49
00:02:10,649 --> 00:02:13,830
about and we're here in part because we

50
00:02:13,830 --> 00:02:14,410
were

51
00:02:14,410 --> 00:02:18,280
invited by Patrick Dubois he had we've

52
00:02:18,280 --> 00:02:21,760
known Patrick since 2008 when we met at

53
00:02:21,760 --> 00:02:24,340
Kip Kahn and scribe known each other

54
00:02:24,340 --> 00:02:27,220
since 2006 something like that we met

55
00:02:27,220 --> 00:02:28,690
kick on to if you don't know what take

56
00:02:28,690 --> 00:02:30,790
on is coming like what will tell you

57
00:02:30,790 --> 00:02:32,830
about that but that to introduce myself

58
00:02:32,830 --> 00:02:35,680
I'm squirrel that is my name but you can

59
00:02:35,680 --> 00:02:37,180
also call me douglas if you'd rather and

60
00:02:37,180 --> 00:02:40,090
i live in england i'm a consulting CTO

61
00:02:40,090 --> 00:02:41,920
which means I work with lots and lots of

62
00:02:41,920 --> 00:02:43,120
different companies without eighty in

63
00:02:43,120 --> 00:02:46,450
the last five years and for all kinds of

64
00:02:46,450 --> 00:02:47,680
conclusions from them which we're gonna

65
00:02:47,680 --> 00:02:50,050
try to share yeah and we're gonna talk

66
00:02:50,050 --> 00:02:52,510
about stuff that unites us grow up we've

67
00:02:52,510 --> 00:02:53,710
been sitting for about eight years and

68
00:02:53,710 --> 00:02:57,070
we're exciting because we've been able

69
00:02:57,070 --> 00:02:59,050
to distill this into a book that we have

70
00:02:59,050 --> 00:03:01,810
this committee coming out in May which

71
00:03:01,810 --> 00:03:03,820
is which is just shockingly just next

72
00:03:03,820 --> 00:03:06,990
month after a couple of years journey

73
00:03:06,990 --> 00:03:10,510
we're almost there and and it's really

74
00:03:10,510 --> 00:03:12,130
the lessons from that book that we're

75
00:03:12,130 --> 00:03:15,400
going to be highlighting here today and

76
00:03:15,400 --> 00:03:17,980
in particular if we kind of go from the

77
00:03:17,980 --> 00:03:20,410
the the high-level version like the

78
00:03:20,410 --> 00:03:23,320
major message that I want people to get

79
00:03:23,320 --> 00:03:25,270
away from this is that there is if

80
00:03:25,270 --> 00:03:27,459
they're frustrated that's a very

81
00:03:27,459 --> 00:03:29,770
valuable signal that there's something

82
00:03:29,770 --> 00:03:31,390
that you that you could be doing

83
00:03:31,390 --> 00:03:33,820
differently and in the key word in that

84
00:03:33,820 --> 00:03:38,140
sentence is you yes exactly and and and

85
00:03:38,140 --> 00:03:40,000
that's our hope is we want to give you

86
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:41,830
something that you could do differently

87
00:03:41,830 --> 00:03:44,050
today that this is something you could

88
00:03:44,050 --> 00:03:45,610
apply today

89
00:03:45,610 --> 00:03:47,800
I suppose unless for those people who've

90
00:03:47,800 --> 00:03:49,300
in a different time zone and you're just

91
00:03:49,300 --> 00:03:50,650
about getting close to midnight

92
00:03:50,650 --> 00:03:52,330
maybe that's tomorrow would be okay

93
00:03:52,330 --> 00:03:54,220
tomorrow's fine but you shouldn't have

94
00:03:54,220 --> 00:03:55,930
to wait this is not a long-term plan

95
00:03:55,930 --> 00:03:57,060
this is something they can get results

96
00:03:57,060 --> 00:03:59,680
very quickly and it may not be obvious

97
00:03:59,680 --> 00:04:01,480
exactly how this is linked to DevOps

98
00:04:01,480 --> 00:04:02,680
although if you were paying attention to

99
00:04:02,680 --> 00:04:04,780
the last speakers that actually should

100
00:04:04,780 --> 00:04:06,970
be pinging in your brain right now but

101
00:04:06,970 --> 00:04:08,709
we'll explain as we go how this is

102
00:04:08,709 --> 00:04:10,239
linked to DevOps agile those sorts of

103
00:04:10,239 --> 00:04:11,770
things because may not be obvious

104
00:04:11,770 --> 00:04:15,040
immediately yeah one of the ways I think

105
00:04:15,040 --> 00:04:17,769
that maybe some people who are listening

106
00:04:17,769 --> 00:04:19,418
with would understand that the

107
00:04:19,418 --> 00:04:20,470
connection is if they understand that

108
00:04:20,470 --> 00:04:21,880
they're in a religion that's going to

109
00:04:21,880 --> 00:04:24,490
under-eye DevOps transformation now I

110
00:04:24,490 --> 00:04:25,660
know that people have been do that

111
00:04:25,660 --> 00:04:27,220
DevOps for a long time that might seem

112
00:04:27,220 --> 00:04:27,790
like a

113
00:04:27,790 --> 00:04:30,070
a strange idea but there's one thing I

114
00:04:30,070 --> 00:04:32,440
can guarantee you that no matter how

115
00:04:32,440 --> 00:04:34,960
familiar that DevOps might be to you

116
00:04:34,960 --> 00:04:36,610
that there's other people who it's just

117
00:04:36,610 --> 00:04:38,560
brand new - and who it's just there it's

118
00:04:38,560 --> 00:04:40,420
just blowing their mind and this may be

119
00:04:40,420 --> 00:04:43,510
why hire a DevOps I need a DevOps what

120
00:04:43,510 --> 00:04:45,010
does one look like you know how do I

121
00:04:45,010 --> 00:04:47,460
write the job description for a dev ops

122
00:04:47,460 --> 00:04:49,720
yes exactly

123
00:04:49,720 --> 00:04:51,130
it said so there are people there who

124
00:04:51,130 --> 00:04:54,820
are just at the beginning of the

125
00:04:54,820 --> 00:04:57,370
transformation and if you've already

126
00:04:57,370 --> 00:04:58,420
come through it and you've come through

127
00:04:58,420 --> 00:05:00,760
successfully well in a sense you know

128
00:05:00,760 --> 00:05:02,200
kind of why are you here maybe you're

129
00:05:02,200 --> 00:05:03,670
not frustrated maybe you're like no

130
00:05:03,670 --> 00:05:04,570
everything's great

131
00:05:04,570 --> 00:05:06,100
I'm just worried about why those other

132
00:05:06,100 --> 00:05:07,810
people are frustrated which that's fine

133
00:05:07,810 --> 00:05:10,450
but we'll say this for usually when what

134
00:05:10,450 --> 00:05:11,650
I've seen when people come in to do

135
00:05:11,650 --> 00:05:13,420
their DevOps transformation it doesn't

136
00:05:13,420 --> 00:05:15,370
have to be DevOps it could be an agile

137
00:05:15,370 --> 00:05:18,340
conversation it could be a natural

138
00:05:18,340 --> 00:05:20,230
transformation it could be a definite

139
00:05:20,230 --> 00:05:21,400
summation these days you heard a lot

140
00:05:21,400 --> 00:05:24,310
about a digital transformation they

141
00:05:24,310 --> 00:05:27,760
people often it frustrating and the one

142
00:05:27,760 --> 00:05:30,430
of the key reasons that they end up

143
00:05:30,430 --> 00:05:32,380
frustrated is they come in thinking that

144
00:05:32,380 --> 00:05:33,820
it's about different practices and

145
00:05:33,820 --> 00:05:35,740
different processes and it turns out

146
00:05:35,740 --> 00:05:37,720
that's actually around about people and

147
00:05:37,720 --> 00:05:41,230
it's about changing the culture and and

148
00:05:41,230 --> 00:05:42,250
that ends what do I need I need

149
00:05:42,250 --> 00:05:45,520
kubernetes and one of the stand up

150
00:05:45,520 --> 00:05:48,430
things and yeah good we're all set we're

151
00:05:48,430 --> 00:05:50,250
all we're all ready everything's good

152
00:05:50,250 --> 00:05:54,550
this leads to disaster and I know one of

153
00:05:54,550 --> 00:05:58,810
our motivations here about writing our

154
00:05:58,810 --> 00:06:00,760
book and dealing with his issue around

155
00:06:00,760 --> 00:06:04,540
transformations was a book called five

156
00:06:04,540 --> 00:06:07,450
dysfunctions of a team and where they

157
00:06:07,450 --> 00:06:09,130
said something very similar which is

158
00:06:09,130 --> 00:06:11,920
it's really important that you have if

159
00:06:11,920 --> 00:06:13,270
you want to change the dynamics and your

160
00:06:13,270 --> 00:06:15,280
team that you're addressing the culture

161
00:06:15,280 --> 00:06:19,210
and in fact they they talk about the

162
00:06:19,210 --> 00:06:20,710
very first dysfunction do you recall

163
00:06:20,710 --> 00:06:23,230
what that is squirrels certainly yeah I

164
00:06:23,230 --> 00:06:24,520
talk about it all the time so that's

165
00:06:24,520 --> 00:06:25,510
trust

166
00:06:25,510 --> 00:06:27,340
so the first destruction is to not have

167
00:06:27,340 --> 00:06:29,410
trust and I was very excited when I read

168
00:06:29,410 --> 00:06:30,790
the book because and you probably read

169
00:06:30,790 --> 00:06:31,930
books like this or you haven't read this

170
00:06:31,930 --> 00:06:33,880
one it says oh yeah so you're supposed

171
00:06:33,880 --> 00:06:35,230
to fix trust and here's what trust is

172
00:06:35,230 --> 00:06:36,580
and here's how bad it can be if you

173
00:06:36,580 --> 00:06:38,169
don't have trust so definitely have

174
00:06:38,169 --> 00:06:40,570
trust and then I was like where's the

175
00:06:40,570 --> 00:06:41,770
part where I learn how

176
00:06:41,770 --> 00:06:44,979
to create trust it wasn't there actually

177
00:06:44,979 --> 00:06:46,120
it turned out there's this thing way in

178
00:06:46,120 --> 00:06:47,530
the back that I found years later and

179
00:06:47,530 --> 00:06:49,629
and it describes like going on a ropes

180
00:06:49,629 --> 00:06:51,909
course and I didn't convince me that

181
00:06:51,909 --> 00:06:53,620
that was a good way to create trust so I

182
00:06:53,620 --> 00:06:54,729
threw the book across the room I was

183
00:06:54,729 --> 00:06:56,080
really frustrated I wanted my money back

184
00:06:56,080 --> 00:06:58,509
so I was definitely frustrated you know

185
00:06:58,509 --> 00:07:01,930
so we're gonna try to link that that

186
00:07:01,930 --> 00:07:04,150
frustration that you had and the

187
00:07:04,150 --> 00:07:05,050
frustration other people might be

188
00:07:05,050 --> 00:07:06,699
feeling with this larger question of

189
00:07:06,699 --> 00:07:08,349
culture a lot times people are saying

190
00:07:08,349 --> 00:07:09,389
yeah we want our culture to change

191
00:07:09,389 --> 00:07:11,349
because the problem is those other

192
00:07:11,349 --> 00:07:13,629
people you know they they have they have

193
00:07:13,629 --> 00:07:15,190
the wrong culture I just have to

194
00:07:15,190 --> 00:07:17,080
convince them to do the right thing and

195
00:07:17,080 --> 00:07:19,750
then it'll be fine that's right now one

196
00:07:19,750 --> 00:07:20,740
of the things that's interesting thing

197
00:07:20,740 --> 00:07:21,819
is you can start with like what's the

198
00:07:21,819 --> 00:07:24,030
culture that you're starting with and

199
00:07:24,030 --> 00:07:27,340
we're using here the model of Ron

200
00:07:27,340 --> 00:07:29,650
westrom and the three cultures which I

201
00:07:29,650 --> 00:07:33,840
mean I first came across in accelerate

202
00:07:33,840 --> 00:07:37,650
with Jean King Noel front enou Cal ha

203
00:07:37,650 --> 00:07:40,900
Nicole Fras Greene and another in this

204
00:07:40,900 --> 00:07:44,560
model of the three cultures is really

205
00:07:44,560 --> 00:07:45,520
interesting it to me

206
00:07:45,520 --> 00:07:47,949
and now there's a bit of a tell about

207
00:07:47,949 --> 00:07:49,300
which one's the good one in which one's

208
00:07:49,300 --> 00:07:51,219
the bad one it kind of the choices your

209
00:07:51,219 --> 00:07:54,639
culture is pathological bureaucratic or

210
00:07:54,639 --> 00:07:56,229
generative now

211
00:07:56,229 --> 00:07:57,759
yeah with if you know nothing else or

212
00:07:57,759 --> 00:07:59,050
than the names which of the three do you

213
00:07:59,050 --> 00:08:00,669
think you'd want to be part of oh I

214
00:08:00,669 --> 00:08:02,770
guess I gotta be pathological Jeffery I

215
00:08:02,770 --> 00:08:05,800
love being pathological so great know

216
00:08:05,800 --> 00:08:07,509
you always know that the first two are

217
00:08:07,509 --> 00:08:08,680
the ones you don't want to be and the

218
00:08:08,680 --> 00:08:10,360
third one is the one you want to be this

219
00:08:10,360 --> 00:08:12,430
is the classic plot of any talk like

220
00:08:12,430 --> 00:08:16,419
this yeah exactly and the thing is you

221
00:08:16,419 --> 00:08:18,520
whatever company you're in right now you

222
00:08:18,520 --> 00:08:22,500
you are within some sort of culture and

223
00:08:22,500 --> 00:08:24,460
when people are frustrated it's usually

224
00:08:24,460 --> 00:08:28,719
perceive other people as behaving is one

225
00:08:28,719 --> 00:08:30,430
of the first to they say you know people

226
00:08:30,430 --> 00:08:33,370
are either pathological this is a

227
00:08:33,370 --> 00:08:36,089
top-down hierarchical organization or

228
00:08:36,089 --> 00:08:38,409
it's just bureaucratic and all that

229
00:08:38,409 --> 00:08:40,899
matters are rules and and and people

230
00:08:40,899 --> 00:08:42,729
protecting their turf that why aren't

231
00:08:42,729 --> 00:08:44,020
people focus on the mission why don't

232
00:08:44,020 --> 00:08:45,940
people focus on being better and that's

233
00:08:45,940 --> 00:08:47,230
kind of the source of their frustration

234
00:08:47,230 --> 00:08:50,079
now the thing is I stuck a pole in the

235
00:08:50,079 --> 00:08:53,850
tap in the tractive suck-ups channel

236
00:08:53,850 --> 00:08:55,480
appreciate it if any

237
00:08:55,480 --> 00:08:57,550
who would like to we would respond to

238
00:08:57,550 --> 00:08:58,839
the poll which one do you think you're

239
00:08:58,839 --> 00:09:01,870
in now excellent so will well have you

240
00:09:01,870 --> 00:09:03,639
good if you switch over to slack you can

241
00:09:03,639 --> 00:09:05,680
go ahead and fill that in now and and

242
00:09:05,680 --> 00:09:07,149
we'll check he doesn't go up it's okay

243
00:09:07,149 --> 00:09:09,459
we don't mind but we like interacting

244
00:09:09,459 --> 00:09:10,750
with our audience so we'd like a sense

245
00:09:10,750 --> 00:09:12,699
of where you guys feel you are hopefully

246
00:09:12,699 --> 00:09:14,800
you can do both you can you can still

247
00:09:14,800 --> 00:09:17,769
listen to us while there if you if

248
00:09:17,769 --> 00:09:18,940
you're quick you won't even miss the

249
00:09:18,940 --> 00:09:21,839
slight change but let's say that

250
00:09:21,839 --> 00:09:25,750
whatever culture you're part of when you

251
00:09:25,750 --> 00:09:27,730
go to transform when you go to make this

252
00:09:27,730 --> 00:09:30,790
change odds are you saying we want to

253
00:09:30,790 --> 00:09:32,470
end up with a generative culture however

254
00:09:32,470 --> 00:09:34,230
your approach to that transformation

255
00:09:34,230 --> 00:09:37,120
will probably reflect the culture you're

256
00:09:37,120 --> 00:09:39,220
part of so on a pathological

257
00:09:39,220 --> 00:09:41,440
pathological organization the

258
00:09:41,440 --> 00:09:42,820
transformation is typically directed

259
00:09:42,820 --> 00:09:45,820
top-down and just you know imposed and

260
00:09:45,820 --> 00:09:46,810
you're just going to be writing

261
00:09:46,810 --> 00:09:48,639
roughshod over the bodies you know this

262
00:09:48,639 --> 00:09:49,329
is what we're doing

263
00:09:49,329 --> 00:09:52,720
and if you don't like it too bad and

264
00:09:52,720 --> 00:09:54,370
then at the end of it turns out that

265
00:09:54,370 --> 00:09:56,019
that doesn't generate that doesn't

266
00:09:56,019 --> 00:09:59,290
create a generative culture a

267
00:09:59,290 --> 00:10:02,440
bureaucratic culture is one that I've

268
00:10:02,440 --> 00:10:04,569
come across more and more frequently and

269
00:10:04,569 --> 00:10:06,519
I think it might be something that has

270
00:10:06,519 --> 00:10:08,079
to do with people who are later coming

271
00:10:08,079 --> 00:10:10,839
in being people who are sort of at go

272
00:10:10,839 --> 00:10:12,010
saying like well this is the standard

273
00:10:12,010 --> 00:10:13,209
now we're supposed to do the DevOps

274
00:10:13,209 --> 00:10:15,850
standard thing so you know where are the

275
00:10:15,850 --> 00:10:18,040
forms where our DevOps forms do we do

276
00:10:18,040 --> 00:10:21,100
you know how we is this in the scrum you

277
00:10:21,100 --> 00:10:23,170
know rulebook that's the you know 72 or

278
00:10:23,170 --> 00:10:25,240
page 79 they don't seem to match that's

279
00:10:25,240 --> 00:10:28,720
right I have my ITIL guide to DevOps so

280
00:10:28,720 --> 00:10:30,010
it's all going to be okay as long as you

281
00:10:30,010 --> 00:10:31,779
just follow these forms and go through

282
00:10:31,779 --> 00:10:34,839
this process and and again following the

283
00:10:34,839 --> 00:10:37,779
rules isn't a great way to end up with a

284
00:10:37,779 --> 00:10:43,720
generative culture so ideally you want

285
00:10:43,720 --> 00:10:45,100
to be approaching your transformation

286
00:10:45,100 --> 00:10:47,889
the same way that you want to end up so

287
00:10:47,889 --> 00:10:49,990
if you you may be in a pathological or

288
00:10:49,990 --> 00:10:52,300
bureaucratic environment but if you try

289
00:10:52,300 --> 00:10:54,639
leading your transformation that way

290
00:10:54,639 --> 00:10:56,649
it's unlikely to end up in a generative

291
00:10:56,649 --> 00:11:02,069
result and this is where this connects

292
00:11:02,069 --> 00:11:04,990
to you because you might be saying well

293
00:11:04,990 --> 00:11:07,520
what is it that I can do

294
00:11:07,520 --> 00:11:09,500
to change the type of culture I mean if

295
00:11:09,500 --> 00:11:11,000
I want to move from pathological and

296
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:14,420
bureaucratic what is it I need to do to

297
00:11:14,420 --> 00:11:17,810
end up at the generative culture that

298
00:11:17,810 --> 00:11:22,310
I'm aiming for and our claim is that you

299
00:11:22,310 --> 00:11:24,380
can do that by changing the

300
00:11:24,380 --> 00:11:26,810
conversations if you change your

301
00:11:26,810 --> 00:11:29,720
conversations you change your culture so

302
00:11:29,720 --> 00:11:31,940
you place if you type the poll correctly

303
00:11:31,940 --> 00:11:33,230
you get the right poll so I just

304
00:11:33,230 --> 00:11:34,550
realized I did the poll wrong so

305
00:11:34,550 --> 00:11:36,440
apologies I redid the poll if you want

306
00:11:36,440 --> 00:11:39,050
to go in I'm gonna vote for one choice

307
00:11:39,050 --> 00:11:40,310
that was not a very huh there's gonna

308
00:11:40,310 --> 00:11:44,300
pathological with me apologies right to

309
00:11:44,300 --> 00:11:46,130
choose from this list and there's one

310
00:11:46,130 --> 00:11:48,110
yeah that wasn't very good let's try

311
00:11:48,110 --> 00:11:52,850
right again keep going okay so so here's

312
00:11:52,850 --> 00:11:56,180
the thing is is it you are part of your

313
00:11:56,180 --> 00:11:58,070
culture and your behavior will change it

314
00:11:58,070 --> 00:11:59,930
now what we're gonna be talking about is

315
00:11:59,930 --> 00:12:02,029
some theory that goes back into this

316
00:12:02,029 --> 00:12:04,640
into the 70s so this is not in a sense

317
00:12:04,640 --> 00:12:08,300
new that what's what's new what I think

318
00:12:08,300 --> 00:12:10,760
is is it being brought into we're hoping

319
00:12:10,760 --> 00:12:13,550
is to bringing it mainstream into the

320
00:12:13,550 --> 00:12:15,380
way organizations work today for people

321
00:12:15,380 --> 00:12:17,660
to understand that that they can

322
00:12:17,660 --> 00:12:20,240
personally start changing the

323
00:12:20,240 --> 00:12:22,579
conversations and generating that

324
00:12:22,579 --> 00:12:24,430
generative culture that they want and

325
00:12:24,430 --> 00:12:28,130
the good news here is that you don't

326
00:12:28,130 --> 00:12:31,399
need to learn a new philosophy in a

327
00:12:31,399 --> 00:12:34,610
sense you you already know what the

328
00:12:34,610 --> 00:12:38,029
results look like you you know how to

329
00:12:38,029 --> 00:12:40,760
have a conversation that's one of these

330
00:12:40,760 --> 00:12:42,709
positive generative conversations that

331
00:12:42,709 --> 00:12:44,839
lead to good results and this is the

332
00:12:44,839 --> 00:12:47,779
point where you know we'd really like to

333
00:12:47,779 --> 00:12:51,649
be interactive so if Shirin was

334
00:12:51,649 --> 00:12:57,770
available this would be all right so we

335
00:12:57,770 --> 00:13:01,459
have a question for you yeah you are

336
00:13:01,459 --> 00:13:05,270
going to be deciding the date of next

337
00:13:05,270 --> 00:13:07,670
year's all the talks conference it's

338
00:13:07,670 --> 00:13:09,709
it's up to you to decide the process we

339
00:13:09,709 --> 00:13:11,120
should use and we're gonna use everyone

340
00:13:11,120 --> 00:13:13,399
on who's listening right now to the

341
00:13:13,399 --> 00:13:15,980
stream to males animation decision that

342
00:13:15,980 --> 00:13:17,449
sure owns in charge of how we make the

343
00:13:17,449 --> 00:13:20,930
decision yes have to be super

344
00:13:20,930 --> 00:13:24,640
corporate can I use a doodle hey Elle

345
00:13:24,640 --> 00:13:26,900
it's up to you alright I would probably

346
00:13:26,900 --> 00:13:28,910
crowdsource it I would see who the

347
00:13:28,910 --> 00:13:30,410
organizers are I got a general

348
00:13:30,410 --> 00:13:31,700
understanding of who would be on board

349
00:13:31,700 --> 00:13:33,410
with the logistics and things of that

350
00:13:33,410 --> 00:13:35,270
nature and I would try and understand

351
00:13:35,270 --> 00:13:39,350
engage you know the best dates by giving

352
00:13:39,350 --> 00:13:43,040
a few options possibly if we were

353
00:13:43,040 --> 00:13:46,400
targeting a few like keynote speakers or

354
00:13:46,400 --> 00:13:47,750
folks who would want to target probably

355
00:13:47,750 --> 00:13:49,970
check with them also and to see that we

356
00:13:49,970 --> 00:13:53,150
can have an intelligent mix of you know

357
00:13:53,150 --> 00:13:54,650
the people that would need to organize

358
00:13:54,650 --> 00:13:56,029
and folks that we would want to have

359
00:13:56,029 --> 00:13:58,910
speaking available on specific great

360
00:13:58,910 --> 00:14:00,710
make sense but if I can check that then

361
00:14:00,710 --> 00:14:03,020
you'd share your own opinion like your

362
00:14:03,020 --> 00:14:04,370
opinion about who the keynote speakers

363
00:14:04,370 --> 00:14:05,900
might be and who their keepo people were

364
00:14:05,900 --> 00:14:08,120
to talk to and so you'd be transparent

365
00:14:08,120 --> 00:14:09,920
about what you're gonna do and you'd be

366
00:14:09,920 --> 00:14:11,480
curious about what everybody thought

367
00:14:11,480 --> 00:14:12,950
because somebody might know like a

368
00:14:12,950 --> 00:14:16,790
conflicting date right yeah you win the

369
00:14:16,790 --> 00:14:19,839
award you're like everybody we talked to

370
00:14:19,839 --> 00:14:22,580
answers on the next so I'm no I'm

371
00:14:22,580 --> 00:14:28,580
special because that's a very human

372
00:14:28,580 --> 00:14:31,250
answer to say that's how you like things

373
00:14:31,250 --> 00:14:32,779
to be that's how you would like today

374
00:14:32,779 --> 00:14:35,089
yep and according to Patrick you you

375
00:14:35,089 --> 00:14:36,529
have the job he'd like she likes your

376
00:14:36,529 --> 00:14:40,640
approach so the thing is a and I think

377
00:14:40,640 --> 00:14:42,260
you should that was interactiveness that

378
00:14:42,260 --> 00:14:43,730
we needed and I think is it when

379
00:14:43,730 --> 00:14:45,440
scrolling I've asked this question of

380
00:14:45,440 --> 00:14:47,120
lots of people and I mean not always you

381
00:14:47,120 --> 00:14:48,650
know where we're gonna you know the date

382
00:14:48,650 --> 00:14:50,240
for next year's all the talks but it's

383
00:14:50,240 --> 00:14:52,040
something usually we ask people like

384
00:14:52,040 --> 00:14:53,510
we're gonna go to lunch or something

385
00:14:53,510 --> 00:14:57,440
some much more important but but the

386
00:14:57,440 --> 00:14:58,790
thing is we always get this answer about

387
00:14:58,790 --> 00:15:00,680
well I would be curious and I be

388
00:15:00,680 --> 00:15:03,410
transparent so everyone already agrees

389
00:15:03,410 --> 00:15:04,700
that that's the best way to make a

390
00:15:04,700 --> 00:15:07,910
decision and because everyone

391
00:15:07,910 --> 00:15:11,089
understands that well guess what if we

392
00:15:11,089 --> 00:15:14,089
want a diversity of opinions and that

393
00:15:14,089 --> 00:15:16,610
strength the if we want to be able to

394
00:15:16,610 --> 00:15:18,140
share their ideas we want to have them

395
00:15:18,140 --> 00:15:19,820
to share how they got to those ideas

396
00:15:19,820 --> 00:15:21,440
share their reasoning and that you know

397
00:15:21,440 --> 00:15:22,400
that we should have some back and forth

398
00:15:22,400 --> 00:15:24,650
some some productive collaborative

399
00:15:24,650 --> 00:15:27,380
conflict and that's the best way to get

400
00:15:27,380 --> 00:15:29,780
to the best possible answer now everyone

401
00:15:29,780 --> 00:15:32,750
says that the thing is that this is not

402
00:15:32,750 --> 00:15:34,400
how humans behave

403
00:15:34,400 --> 00:15:35,990
when there's something that they care

404
00:15:35,990 --> 00:15:38,600
about but another way you actually do

405
00:15:38,600 --> 00:15:39,920
behave that way when it's something that

406
00:15:39,920 --> 00:15:42,260
you don't care about if you get brought

407
00:15:42,260 --> 00:15:44,270
in to mediate for other people on a

408
00:15:44,270 --> 00:15:45,740
topic that's not rangin to you you'll

409
00:15:45,740 --> 00:15:48,050
you'll recommend that but if it's your

410
00:15:48,050 --> 00:15:50,570
own decision that you're part of and

411
00:15:50,570 --> 00:15:53,780
you're really concerned that you get the

412
00:15:53,780 --> 00:15:55,400
right answer and you have an opinion on

413
00:15:55,400 --> 00:15:57,320
what the right answer is then suddenly

414
00:15:57,320 --> 00:16:00,350
you're your mindset changes I think you

415
00:16:00,350 --> 00:16:02,240
imagine could we ajan that you were

416
00:16:02,240 --> 00:16:04,100
going to come in and advocate a

417
00:16:04,100 --> 00:16:05,540
particular soft piece of software and

418
00:16:05,540 --> 00:16:06,980
I'm not going to touch the debate but it

419
00:16:06,980 --> 00:16:08,810
might be kubernetes or it might be your

420
00:16:08,810 --> 00:16:10,850
favorite after tool or whatever it is

421
00:16:10,850 --> 00:16:12,320
I'm not gonna get myself in trouble by

422
00:16:12,320 --> 00:16:14,240
picking one because I know what people

423
00:16:14,240 --> 00:16:15,230
would say is well I just have to

424
00:16:15,230 --> 00:16:16,460
convince people I just have to give them

425
00:16:16,460 --> 00:16:18,200
all the information and then once they

426
00:16:18,200 --> 00:16:19,460
have all the information then of course

427
00:16:19,460 --> 00:16:20,840
they will choose the obvious correct

428
00:16:20,840 --> 00:16:23,530
choice which is still in technology X

429
00:16:23,530 --> 00:16:26,510
right and in that's and so that that's

430
00:16:26,510 --> 00:16:27,980
the problem is that when we would we've

431
00:16:27,980 --> 00:16:30,140
have a decision we care about and we've

432
00:16:30,140 --> 00:16:31,910
invested time energy to come to position

433
00:16:31,910 --> 00:16:33,770
we're now attached to that position

434
00:16:33,770 --> 00:16:36,440
we're no longer seeking the best answer

435
00:16:36,440 --> 00:16:38,630
we're seeking to have our answer win and

436
00:16:38,630 --> 00:16:39,950
now instead of diversity being a

437
00:16:39,950 --> 00:16:41,980
strength differences are a threat and

438
00:16:41,980 --> 00:16:44,960
and as a result we no longer behave in

439
00:16:44,960 --> 00:16:46,730
that generative fashion we no longer are

440
00:16:46,730 --> 00:16:48,920
transparent and said we don't share

441
00:16:48,920 --> 00:16:50,780
everything that we know we don't share

442
00:16:50,780 --> 00:16:53,000
how we got to our decision because we're

443
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:54,680
just looking to say no this is obviously

444
00:16:54,680 --> 00:16:56,120
the right thing to do and we don't

445
00:16:56,120 --> 00:16:57,860
listen others we're no longer curious

446
00:16:57,860 --> 00:17:00,770
about what they believe what what's

447
00:17:00,770 --> 00:17:02,900
going on here we're gonna give you a

448
00:17:02,900 --> 00:17:04,280
very simple model again this is not

449
00:17:04,280 --> 00:17:05,810
something we created and it's something

450
00:17:05,810 --> 00:17:08,720
called the ladder of inference and it

451
00:17:08,720 --> 00:17:10,069
could be that many of you've heard of

452
00:17:10,069 --> 00:17:11,420
this before or just might be your first

453
00:17:11,420 --> 00:17:12,770
time coming to it if you were to go

454
00:17:12,770 --> 00:17:14,780
search on the googles and look for a

455
00:17:14,780 --> 00:17:16,130
ladder of inference you'll find lots of

456
00:17:16,130 --> 00:17:17,300
pictures of ladders with lots of

457
00:17:17,300 --> 00:17:18,250
different rungs

458
00:17:18,250 --> 00:17:21,849
the details of every single step here

459
00:17:21,849 --> 00:17:25,069
isn't really the important part the the

460
00:17:25,069 --> 00:17:28,010
key elements of this and why we the this

461
00:17:28,010 --> 00:17:29,240
model and what we like about this

462
00:17:29,240 --> 00:17:31,910
particular picture is that it makes it

463
00:17:31,910 --> 00:17:34,820
clear that most the ladder is inside of

464
00:17:34,820 --> 00:17:37,340
your head that there are some parts that

465
00:17:37,340 --> 00:17:39,710
exist in the real world like things

466
00:17:39,710 --> 00:17:42,830
happen and then we take action in the

467
00:17:42,830 --> 00:17:45,440
real world but between stimulus in the

468
00:17:45,440 --> 00:17:47,410
world and our response in the world

469
00:17:47,410 --> 00:17:49,690
we go through this instantaneous step

470
00:17:49,690 --> 00:17:52,990
from selecting data assigning meetings

471
00:17:52,990 --> 00:17:54,820
making assumptions come any conclusions

472
00:17:54,820 --> 00:17:56,650
and beliefs and guess what the beliefs

473
00:17:56,650 --> 00:18:00,520
we have go back and influence even the

474
00:18:00,520 --> 00:18:02,410
data we see at the beginning and at

475
00:18:02,410 --> 00:18:03,730
people who are familiar with that sort

476
00:18:03,730 --> 00:18:04,750
of feedback loop II that sort of

477
00:18:04,750 --> 00:18:06,700
selection bias they can er send there's

478
00:18:06,700 --> 00:18:09,340
cognitive biases at work here so we have

479
00:18:09,340 --> 00:18:12,070
this process going on in our head but it

480
00:18:12,070 --> 00:18:13,630
it's we're not aware that it's happening

481
00:18:13,630 --> 00:18:16,360
and said it feels like there's something

482
00:18:16,360 --> 00:18:17,950
that happens in the world and then we

483
00:18:17,950 --> 00:18:20,110
have the right answer and it's just

484
00:18:20,110 --> 00:18:22,120
objectively correct that this is the

485
00:18:22,120 --> 00:18:23,440
right answer that there's only one way

486
00:18:23,440 --> 00:18:26,740
to interpret it so Jeffrey I observe

487
00:18:26,740 --> 00:18:28,240
that we have about eight minutes left

488
00:18:28,240 --> 00:18:30,910
before Q&A and the meaning that that has

489
00:18:30,910 --> 00:18:33,180
for me is that we might need to

490
00:18:33,180 --> 00:18:35,320
accelerate it a little bit and I assume

491
00:18:35,320 --> 00:18:36,520
that you agree with me and that you

492
00:18:36,520 --> 00:18:38,260
conclude that we should move on to the

493
00:18:38,260 --> 00:18:40,930
next slide is that is that right that

494
00:18:40,930 --> 00:18:43,150
assured by water effectively that was

495
00:18:43,150 --> 00:18:44,650
what I didn't do was say we should move

496
00:18:44,650 --> 00:18:46,780
to the next slide that's right because

497
00:18:46,780 --> 00:18:48,910
then if you had just said that that I

498
00:18:48,910 --> 00:18:52,720
might say well no I you know I'm I I

499
00:18:52,720 --> 00:18:54,670
think we should stay here but you had

500
00:18:54,670 --> 00:18:56,140
some other way of reasoning to with it

501
00:18:56,140 --> 00:18:57,310
that we would not have shared and that's

502
00:18:57,310 --> 00:18:59,170
what winds up happening you're on this

503
00:18:59,170 --> 00:19:00,820
slide you see this on chat shows all the

504
00:19:00,820 --> 00:19:02,770
time where you have one person who says

505
00:19:02,770 --> 00:19:04,360
we should close the borders and somebody

506
00:19:04,360 --> 00:19:05,740
else says immigration is great and they

507
00:19:05,740 --> 00:19:07,570
just argue about it and what they never

508
00:19:07,570 --> 00:19:09,460
do is come down the ladder and try to

509
00:19:09,460 --> 00:19:10,720
understand the other person's position

510
00:19:10,720 --> 00:19:12,850
and the latter gives you a nice guide

511
00:19:12,850 --> 00:19:14,380
I've had people even write it down on

512
00:19:14,380 --> 00:19:16,060
their hands so they can refer to it and

513
00:19:16,060 --> 00:19:17,770
say which we rely on assumptions of my

514
00:19:17,770 --> 00:19:20,320
own meaning where am I in the middle of

515
00:19:20,320 --> 00:19:22,630
the discussion and so and this slide

516
00:19:22,630 --> 00:19:24,610
essentially caps encapsulating back to

517
00:19:24,610 --> 00:19:27,720
our title here if you're frustrated our

518
00:19:27,720 --> 00:19:29,620
expectation our belief is that you're

519
00:19:29,620 --> 00:19:31,120
probably in a situation with dueling

520
00:19:31,120 --> 00:19:33,370
ladders where you have some opinions

521
00:19:33,370 --> 00:19:35,470
someone else has other opinions but you

522
00:19:35,470 --> 00:19:37,180
haven't shared all of the steps of your

523
00:19:37,180 --> 00:19:40,120
ladder and you haven't inquired into all

524
00:19:40,120 --> 00:19:41,200
the subs there so you haven't been

525
00:19:41,200 --> 00:19:42,700
curious and you haven't been transparent

526
00:19:42,700 --> 00:19:46,470
you haven't been behaving the way they

527
00:19:46,470 --> 00:19:49,150
showed it earlier in you know how we

528
00:19:49,150 --> 00:19:51,160
should approach making a decision how

529
00:19:51,160 --> 00:19:53,470
any of you would espouse other people

530
00:19:53,470 --> 00:19:56,530
make decisions so that's the the paradox

531
00:19:56,530 --> 00:19:58,600
here what we're gonna talk about next is

532
00:19:58,600 --> 00:20:00,850
what you can do about it and we're going

533
00:20:00,850 --> 00:20:01,779
to give you a very simple

534
00:20:01,779 --> 00:20:04,389
model you can apply called the four R's

535
00:20:04,389 --> 00:20:06,639
whatever we forgot something we forgot

536
00:20:06,639 --> 00:20:08,440
to tell people to bring equipment I feel

537
00:20:08,440 --> 00:20:08,979
terrible

538
00:20:08,979 --> 00:20:10,479
there's this important equipment that

539
00:20:10,479 --> 00:20:12,399
you need but I hope our listeners will

540
00:20:12,399 --> 00:20:14,950
flip it around it's a piece of paper and

541
00:20:14,950 --> 00:20:19,419
a pen so I hope everybody is because

542
00:20:19,419 --> 00:20:21,479
that's those rare pieces of equipment

543
00:20:21,479 --> 00:20:23,889
that's right it's it's it's very it's

544
00:20:23,889 --> 00:20:26,139
very very high-tech and we're gonna walk

545
00:20:26,139 --> 00:20:27,909
you through now the steps we're gonna

546
00:20:27,909 --> 00:20:29,889
that it takes and again this is me you

547
00:20:29,889 --> 00:20:31,599
should be able to do today so when

548
00:20:31,599 --> 00:20:33,309
you're gonna look at your conversations

549
00:20:33,309 --> 00:20:35,950
to understand where you can improve them

550
00:20:35,950 --> 00:20:37,389
you're going to go through these four

551
00:20:37,389 --> 00:20:40,419
steps there's a the record step and this

552
00:20:40,419 --> 00:20:42,549
is why you need the paper and pencil you

553
00:20:42,549 --> 00:20:45,820
need to reflect and we're gonna walk you

554
00:20:45,820 --> 00:20:47,200
through how to do that there's different

555
00:20:47,200 --> 00:20:48,249
ways to reflect we're going to talk

556
00:20:48,249 --> 00:20:49,389
about something very simple which is

557
00:20:49,389 --> 00:20:51,339
just this issue of are you curious and

558
00:20:51,339 --> 00:20:54,159
are you transparent then having

559
00:20:54,159 --> 00:20:56,200
discovered where you fell short and

560
00:20:56,200 --> 00:20:58,769
you're going to revise what you've done

561
00:20:58,769 --> 00:21:01,479
and then ideally you're in a situation

562
00:21:01,479 --> 00:21:03,159
where you have someone you can talk to

563
00:21:03,159 --> 00:21:05,200
and you can roleplay your alternative

564
00:21:05,200 --> 00:21:07,749
dialogue and by the way along the way

565
00:21:07,749 --> 00:21:10,419
you might discover that once you've

566
00:21:10,419 --> 00:21:12,219
revised that you can repeat and reflect

567
00:21:12,219 --> 00:21:13,570
again to say did you actually improve it

568
00:21:13,570 --> 00:21:15,219
and did I roleplay could I make it

569
00:21:15,219 --> 00:21:15,700
better

570
00:21:15,700 --> 00:21:17,320
oh and then if I do role reversal and

571
00:21:17,320 --> 00:21:19,149
hear what it sounds like okay so there's

572
00:21:19,149 --> 00:21:21,969
six four R's okay yeah yes just counting

573
00:21:21,969 --> 00:21:25,499
I think somehow our master isn't good

574
00:21:27,659 --> 00:21:33,460
right so let's go first three chord you

575
00:21:33,460 --> 00:21:35,349
need some origami need to fold your

576
00:21:35,349 --> 00:21:37,830
paper in half

577
00:21:37,830 --> 00:21:42,249
all right you can do that now on the

578
00:21:42,249 --> 00:21:44,619
right hand side you'll write the

579
00:21:44,619 --> 00:21:46,479
conversation that would have shown up

580
00:21:46,479 --> 00:21:50,049
like on a video recorder so they said I

581
00:21:50,049 --> 00:21:52,869
said they said I said maybe they stood

582
00:21:52,869 --> 00:21:54,669
up left the room I pounded the table

583
00:21:54,669 --> 00:21:56,080
whatever things that would show up on

584
00:21:56,080 --> 00:21:58,029
the left hand you're gonna write down

585
00:21:58,029 --> 00:22:00,039
the invisible the thoughts and feelings

586
00:22:00,039 --> 00:22:03,129
in your head right and then normally

587
00:22:03,129 --> 00:22:05,019
would give you five minutes but we don't

588
00:22:05,019 --> 00:22:07,359
have time for that so you can be doing

589
00:22:07,359 --> 00:22:09,519
it now and I think scroll you're doing

590
00:22:09,519 --> 00:22:11,499
this real time I certainly am and I'm

591
00:22:11,499 --> 00:22:13,649
already done

592
00:22:13,649 --> 00:22:16,210
great there we go I just finished so

593
00:22:16,210 --> 00:22:17,980
that's how long it should take you right

594
00:22:17,980 --> 00:22:19,330
after write down a little bit of what

595
00:22:19,330 --> 00:22:20,679
they said a little bit of what you said

596
00:22:20,679 --> 00:22:22,389
and that's only the things that you

597
00:22:22,389 --> 00:22:24,190
heard and then what the thoughts were on

598
00:22:24,190 --> 00:22:25,600
the left-hand side that's right so you

599
00:22:25,600 --> 00:22:27,190
get those elements are frustrating and

600
00:22:27,190 --> 00:22:29,799
then you reflect on what you've done so

601
00:22:29,799 --> 00:22:31,480
you go back and just if there's real

602
00:22:31,480 --> 00:22:33,610
simple we're gonna look for curiosity

603
00:22:33,610 --> 00:22:35,919
how many questions did you ask on the

604
00:22:35,919 --> 00:22:37,389
right hand side to circle the question

605
00:22:37,389 --> 00:22:39,850
marks and then ask yourself were those

606
00:22:39,850 --> 00:22:42,639
genuine questions for me I didn't ask

607
00:22:42,639 --> 00:22:44,999
any questions that's normally that's

608
00:22:44,999 --> 00:22:48,129
very curious in this conversation now

609
00:22:48,129 --> 00:22:49,720
sometimes people who ask questions but

610
00:22:49,720 --> 00:22:51,279
they're they're not very genuine

611
00:22:51,279 --> 00:22:51,909
questions

612
00:22:51,909 --> 00:22:53,409
Jeffrey should we finish in two minutes

613
00:22:53,409 --> 00:22:55,480
we've got the Q&A right that's nothing

614
00:22:55,480 --> 00:22:56,889
more new in question that's more of a

615
00:22:56,889 --> 00:22:59,169
there's only one answer that's right and

616
00:22:59,169 --> 00:23:02,230
then on the left you'll say what was I

617
00:23:02,230 --> 00:23:03,850
thinking and feeling that I didn't share

618
00:23:03,850 --> 00:23:06,249
and this is where we often find okay so

619
00:23:06,249 --> 00:23:07,600
I'm not being curious about asking

620
00:23:07,600 --> 00:23:08,919
questions about their letter inference

621
00:23:08,919 --> 00:23:10,480
and I'm not sharing my letter I'm not

622
00:23:10,480 --> 00:23:11,950
sure what I know how I got there I'm not

623
00:23:11,950 --> 00:23:16,960
sure how I'm feeling exactly and if as

624
00:23:16,960 --> 00:23:18,789
you do this over time you'll tend to

625
00:23:18,789 --> 00:23:19,720
find triggers you'll tend to find

626
00:23:19,720 --> 00:23:22,059
repeated patterns of you know this seems

627
00:23:22,059 --> 00:23:24,879
to happen again and again and so that's

628
00:23:24,879 --> 00:23:26,649
really that's what you find in your

629
00:23:26,649 --> 00:23:29,409
reflection so then you go to revise and

630
00:23:29,409 --> 00:23:31,509
when you revise you now say well how

631
00:23:31,509 --> 00:23:33,399
could I be more curious how can it be

632
00:23:33,399 --> 00:23:35,710
more transparent is there a way I can

633
00:23:35,710 --> 00:23:38,080
ask a genuine question meaning a

634
00:23:38,080 --> 00:23:40,389
question where the answer might actually

635
00:23:40,389 --> 00:23:42,999
change my mind yeah so I might ask

636
00:23:42,999 --> 00:23:44,710
Jeffrey I'm curious do we want to go

637
00:23:44,710 --> 00:23:46,539
into the QA or do we want to continue

638
00:23:46,539 --> 00:23:48,700
now I'm open to either that would be a

639
00:23:48,700 --> 00:23:51,340
probably a more genuine question yep

640
00:23:51,340 --> 00:23:54,970
well I'm very keen to get to the QA but

641
00:23:54,970 --> 00:23:56,559
I do want to similarly given you are

642
00:23:56,559 --> 00:23:58,570
done no that's no that's great that's

643
00:23:58,570 --> 00:24:00,279
fantastic is it but it's good for us to

644
00:24:00,279 --> 00:24:01,659
get to the last of the four hours would

645
00:24:01,659 --> 00:24:03,580
be a shame to give them three of the

646
00:24:03,580 --> 00:24:07,179
four I agree so you so I says if you

647
00:24:07,179 --> 00:24:08,259
look for the questions and then you look

648
00:24:08,259 --> 00:24:10,299
on the left to say was I able to bring

649
00:24:10,299 --> 00:24:12,999
some of the thoughts I had and some of

650
00:24:12,999 --> 00:24:14,619
my feelings into the dialogue on the

651
00:24:14,619 --> 00:24:17,919
right so a key tip here if you're

652
00:24:17,919 --> 00:24:20,529
frustrated very often you can start

653
00:24:20,529 --> 00:24:22,000
being more transparent by using the

654
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:25,240
words I'm afraid as in I'm afraid if we

655
00:24:25,240 --> 00:24:26,850
were good on this route that we might be

656
00:24:26,850 --> 00:24:29,610
missing XYZ so I'm afraid our vision

657
00:24:29,610 --> 00:24:31,590
could say I'm afraid that I haven't

658
00:24:31,590 --> 00:24:33,060
answered that question before that was

659
00:24:33,060 --> 00:24:35,370
how I was rising my particular

660
00:24:35,370 --> 00:24:38,970
conversation right and so then last if

661
00:24:38,970 --> 00:24:42,510
you have been able to unless you got

662
00:24:42,510 --> 00:24:43,890
through you created a script and you've

663
00:24:43,890 --> 00:24:46,200
you've revised now maybe you've gone

664
00:24:46,200 --> 00:24:48,350
back around the sort of the revise and

665
00:24:48,350 --> 00:24:50,790
reflect cycle multiple times until you

666
00:24:50,790 --> 00:24:52,010
have something in writing that you like

667
00:24:52,010 --> 00:24:54,480
then you try role-playing with someone

668
00:24:54,480 --> 00:24:56,760
and say how does it sound oh I am I

669
00:24:56,760 --> 00:24:58,290
happy saying this now it's grow you just

670
00:24:58,290 --> 00:25:00,600
got to roleplay yours yep

671
00:25:00,600 --> 00:25:02,820
so how did that feel to you you felt

672
00:25:02,820 --> 00:25:04,740
okay I'm not sure I had the freezing

673
00:25:04,740 --> 00:25:05,880
quite right so I think there's some more

674
00:25:05,880 --> 00:25:08,040
to improve there but it was helpful to

675
00:25:08,040 --> 00:25:09,210
share the feeling I had which was

676
00:25:09,210 --> 00:25:10,800
horrible any idea how they answer for

677
00:25:10,800 --> 00:25:13,080
this and and and this is where the real

678
00:25:13,080 --> 00:25:14,640
reversal is if you have a friend you're

679
00:25:14,640 --> 00:25:15,990
practicing with you might have them say

680
00:25:15,990 --> 00:25:17,970
it back to you because sometimes things

681
00:25:17,970 --> 00:25:19,950
that you find just totally natural

682
00:25:19,950 --> 00:25:21,570
saying when you hear them you go oh I

683
00:25:21,570 --> 00:25:22,830
don't like the way that sounds I

684
00:25:22,830 --> 00:25:24,150
wouldn't want someone saying that to me

685
00:25:24,150 --> 00:25:26,550
so you have another chance to revise so

686
00:25:26,550 --> 00:25:28,950
that's it that's the four R's record

687
00:25:28,950 --> 00:25:33,060
reflect revives and role play and the

688
00:25:33,060 --> 00:25:35,070
thing is the outcome of this is very

689
00:25:35,070 --> 00:25:36,690
predictable this is that this is

690
00:25:36,690 --> 00:25:38,370
something that was is there in the

691
00:25:38,370 --> 00:25:40,710
theory that squirrel and I picked up the

692
00:25:40,710 --> 00:25:43,170
from Chris our juris and it's something

693
00:25:43,170 --> 00:25:45,090
that we've seen in our own practice over

694
00:25:45,090 --> 00:25:47,580
the past eight years has made a huge

695
00:25:47,580 --> 00:25:49,800
difference for us now it's not something

696
00:25:49,800 --> 00:25:52,260
that comes instantly this is a skill

697
00:25:52,260 --> 00:25:54,360
you're developing Chris Archer said it

698
00:25:54,360 --> 00:25:55,680
takes you about as long as it takes to

699
00:25:55,680 --> 00:25:58,530
play a passable game of tennis the good

700
00:25:58,530 --> 00:26:00,390
news is that unlike tennis unless you're

701
00:26:00,390 --> 00:26:02,130
a tennis pro this is something you

702
00:26:02,130 --> 00:26:04,500
couldn't practice every day every every

703
00:26:04,500 --> 00:26:05,730
time you're in conversations of time

704
00:26:05,730 --> 00:26:07,200
you're in meetings at work and rhythm

705
00:26:07,200 --> 00:26:09,240
you're frustrated you can think oh this

706
00:26:09,240 --> 00:26:10,650
is a way for me to go back and say how

707
00:26:10,650 --> 00:26:12,510
am i contributing how could I be more

708
00:26:12,510 --> 00:26:13,920
transparent how could it be more curious

709
00:26:13,920 --> 00:26:16,890
and we think you'll get better outcomes

710
00:26:16,890 --> 00:26:19,680
as a result so this is one of the

711
00:26:19,680 --> 00:26:21,360
elements for a book in our book we go

712
00:26:21,360 --> 00:26:22,350
through five other types of

713
00:26:22,350 --> 00:26:23,760
conversations will reply this same

714
00:26:23,760 --> 00:26:25,860
theory where we reflect in different

715
00:26:25,860 --> 00:26:27,150
ways and revise to different outcomes

716
00:26:27,150 --> 00:26:29,160
and you've got up these slides so you

717
00:26:29,160 --> 00:26:30,810
can have a look at this in more depth

718
00:26:30,810 --> 00:26:32,670
and detail then we have time for today

719
00:26:32,670 --> 00:26:35,010
right and and so with that I think we

720
00:26:35,010 --> 00:26:38,350
should go over to took you a

721
00:26:38,350 --> 00:26:40,270
so that was fantastic first of all you

722
00:26:40,270 --> 00:26:43,720
guys are a dynamic duo it's really fun

723
00:26:43,720 --> 00:26:46,210
so a few questions how do you convince

724
00:26:46,210 --> 00:26:47,830
your colleagues to be open about your

725
00:26:47,830 --> 00:26:48,700
sloppy right there

726
00:26:48,700 --> 00:26:50,650
so the problem the problem I've already

727
00:26:50,650 --> 00:26:53,500
defected inward number four so when you

728
00:26:53,500 --> 00:26:54,669
start a sentence with how do you

729
00:26:54,669 --> 00:26:56,620
convince the problem is it's your fault

730
00:26:56,620 --> 00:26:58,539
that's good news so you're frustrated by

731
00:26:58,539 --> 00:27:00,309
something and it's your fault so you're

732
00:27:00,309 --> 00:27:02,309
what you should do what you should do is

733
00:27:02,309 --> 00:27:05,650
recast your question so instead of

734
00:27:05,650 --> 00:27:08,350
trying to convince them to be open what

735
00:27:08,350 --> 00:27:09,910
you might do is have a conversation with

736
00:27:09,910 --> 00:27:11,409
them in which you share your reasoning I

737
00:27:11,409 --> 00:27:13,059
have been through this crazy talk at

738
00:27:13,059 --> 00:27:15,130
some crazy time in the morning and these

739
00:27:15,130 --> 00:27:16,870
insane people told me that I should talk

740
00:27:16,870 --> 00:27:18,580
to you more would that be helpful what

741
00:27:18,580 --> 00:27:20,620
do you think about that my reasoning for

742
00:27:20,620 --> 00:27:21,909
that is that I think we don't have very

743
00:27:21,909 --> 00:27:23,980
good conversations and here's an example

744
00:27:23,980 --> 00:27:26,080
from last week if you have that kind of

745
00:27:26,080 --> 00:27:26,710
conversation

746
00:27:26,710 --> 00:27:28,990
the result is likely to be better they

747
00:27:28,990 --> 00:27:31,120
may not be convinced so it may be that

748
00:27:31,120 --> 00:27:32,679
you get convinced that's the whole point

749
00:27:32,679 --> 00:27:34,570
of the dueling ladders is that on the

750
00:27:34,570 --> 00:27:36,039
track shows you never see somebody say

751
00:27:36,039 --> 00:27:38,110
you know you're right actually we should

752
00:27:38,110 --> 00:27:39,610
close the borders I understand that can

753
00:27:39,610 --> 00:27:41,140
I join your party that just never

754
00:27:41,140 --> 00:27:43,690
happens so we are looking at where the

755
00:27:43,690 --> 00:27:45,580
option of having that kind of change of

756
00:27:45,580 --> 00:27:47,020
mindset and when you do that you're more

757
00:27:47,020 --> 00:27:48,190
likely to get a better result

758
00:27:48,190 --> 00:27:50,289
so words matter your nod to the right

759
00:27:50,289 --> 00:27:52,419
words and in your own mind so this is

760
00:27:52,419 --> 00:27:53,980
your own mind how do I convince so you'd

761
00:27:53,980 --> 00:27:57,400
stop thinking that okay so as a manager

762
00:27:57,400 --> 00:27:59,230
how can I foster this open culture and

763
00:27:59,230 --> 00:28:01,059
what if what benefits is given me as

764
00:28:01,059 --> 00:28:06,700
manager also I guess to the team yeah so

765
00:28:06,700 --> 00:28:08,500
I think that the benefits are better

766
00:28:08,500 --> 00:28:11,350
decision-making as a group also that

767
00:28:11,350 --> 00:28:13,120
that people are are happier the result

768
00:28:13,120 --> 00:28:14,590
because they feel that they're part of

769
00:28:14,590 --> 00:28:16,570
it it's like adding your own egg you

770
00:28:16,570 --> 00:28:19,179
know the people are its if people

771
00:28:19,179 --> 00:28:21,520
usually are happy not just if they get

772
00:28:21,520 --> 00:28:23,020
their away but if they feel like they've

773
00:28:23,020 --> 00:28:25,630
been heard so they're quite happy to go

774
00:28:25,630 --> 00:28:27,159
along and commit to things that they

775
00:28:27,159 --> 00:28:29,470
weren't there idea as long as they feel

776
00:28:29,470 --> 00:28:30,880
that people have heard them out so

777
00:28:30,880 --> 00:28:31,809
that's I think one of the big benefits

778
00:28:31,809 --> 00:28:34,299
here both transparency and curiosity you

779
00:28:34,299 --> 00:28:37,539
get more ideas from people and and it's

780
00:28:37,539 --> 00:28:38,799
so therefore you're better decisions and

781
00:28:38,799 --> 00:28:40,000
people are more committed to the result

782
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:42,520
because they've been heard and how do

783
00:28:42,520 --> 00:28:44,530
you foster it is the main reason the

784
00:28:44,530 --> 00:28:46,150
main thing is to be transparent and

785
00:28:46,150 --> 00:28:48,190
curious yourself much look like you

786
00:28:48,190 --> 00:28:49,929
modeled for us earlier on the question

787
00:28:49,929 --> 00:28:52,270
of where we we when would we host the

788
00:28:52,270 --> 00:28:52,560
calm

789
00:28:52,560 --> 00:28:54,480
if you go with it that idea like we're

790
00:28:54,480 --> 00:28:55,740
here to get all the possible information

791
00:28:55,740 --> 00:28:58,860
people generally I find are quite happy

792
00:28:58,860 --> 00:29:03,300
to take you up on that invitation and

793
00:29:03,300 --> 00:29:06,210
let's say that your manager isn't you

794
00:29:06,210 --> 00:29:07,470
know the type that would be as

795
00:29:07,470 --> 00:29:11,460
transparent or you know so so well yeah

796
00:29:11,460 --> 00:29:13,680
we're not the trip that the manager now

797
00:29:13,680 --> 00:29:15,390
we're going with somebody matches us is

798
00:29:15,390 --> 00:29:16,920
that right so if you're in that

799
00:29:16,920 --> 00:29:19,530
situation I claim that you're gonna be

800
00:29:19,530 --> 00:29:21,870
net better off if you you don't go to

801
00:29:21,870 --> 00:29:23,400
the top of your ladder if you don't

802
00:29:23,400 --> 00:29:26,610
start dueling and the reason is that if

803
00:29:26,610 --> 00:29:29,280
you just join the other person at the

804
00:29:29,280 --> 00:29:30,480
top of the ladder and just argue there's

805
00:29:30,480 --> 00:29:32,970
no chance whatsoever that anyone will

806
00:29:32,970 --> 00:29:34,140
find out what your reasoning was that

807
00:29:34,140 --> 00:29:35,700
you'll be transparent or that you'll

808
00:29:35,700 --> 00:29:37,050
have any chance of finding out what the

809
00:29:37,050 --> 00:29:39,660
other person thinks if you ask questions

810
00:29:39,660 --> 00:29:41,430
and you're open to them and you might

811
00:29:41,430 --> 00:29:42,570
like for example find out their

812
00:29:42,570 --> 00:29:43,740
reasoning they're really interested in

813
00:29:43,740 --> 00:29:44,790
telling you their reason they aren't

814
00:29:44,790 --> 00:29:46,710
much interested in hearing yours but

815
00:29:46,710 --> 00:29:48,240
that's still hopeful to you that's still

816
00:29:48,240 --> 00:29:49,830
ahead you've got half of it you've got

817
00:29:49,830 --> 00:29:50,970
the curiosity haven't got the

818
00:29:50,970 --> 00:29:54,450
transparency and and that's still a net

819
00:29:54,450 --> 00:29:57,300
win I've never heard anyone of to hear

820
00:29:57,300 --> 00:30:00,060
an argument for why it could be better

821
00:30:00,060 --> 00:30:03,480
to simply not share anything for have no

822
00:30:03,480 --> 00:30:05,310
sharing either direction for arguing

823
00:30:05,310 --> 00:30:07,830
that that simply presents the dueling

824
00:30:07,830 --> 00:30:09,960
matters problems I'll say this is this

825
00:30:09,960 --> 00:30:12,330
is a common question we get in our we

826
00:30:12,330 --> 00:30:14,400
tell people is if you if you start this

827
00:30:14,400 --> 00:30:15,810
way you'll change the way other people

828
00:30:15,810 --> 00:30:18,000
behave they will react differently when

829
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:19,800
you act differently they're not

830
00:30:19,800 --> 00:30:21,360
guaranteed but it's more likely and

831
00:30:21,360 --> 00:30:22,650
there's there's no other we don't know

832
00:30:22,650 --> 00:30:24,300
another way to get to that change

833
00:30:24,300 --> 00:30:24,900
behavior

834
00:30:24,900 --> 00:30:29,400
so exactly and the theory is called

835
00:30:29,400 --> 00:30:30,870
action science that means you can go

836
00:30:30,870 --> 00:30:32,880
experiment so go do an experiment try

837
00:30:32,880 --> 00:30:34,830
this out we're right if we're wrong

838
00:30:34,830 --> 00:30:36,360
please get in touch with us and tell us

839
00:30:36,360 --> 00:30:38,010
we're wrong it went by very quickly

840
00:30:38,010 --> 00:30:39,780
we're on conversational transformation

841
00:30:39,780 --> 00:30:41,610
calm so you can come and find this lots

842
00:30:41,610 --> 00:30:44,220
of place they're awesome and very last

843
00:30:44,220 --> 00:30:46,860
one how would you see this improving

844
00:30:46,860 --> 00:30:49,560
team stand up Geoffrey can you take that

845
00:30:49,560 --> 00:30:51,540
one I thought that you would jump on is

846
00:30:51,540 --> 00:30:57,720
your first one says here okay I think

847
00:30:57,720 --> 00:30:59,730
the the stand ups a lot of it would

848
00:30:59,730 --> 00:31:01,740
probably be in the retrospective re

849
00:31:01,740 --> 00:31:02,940
describe your stand ups because this

850
00:31:02,940 --> 00:31:06,170
question is are your stamps already okay

851
00:31:06,170 --> 00:31:08,840
yeah the real thing question is are

852
00:31:08,840 --> 00:31:10,940
people sharing the relevant information

853
00:31:10,940 --> 00:31:12,290
and are they curious about what do

854
00:31:12,290 --> 00:31:13,790
people are saying if people are showing

855
00:31:13,790 --> 00:31:15,140
up to stand up just to say that a bit

856
00:31:15,140 --> 00:31:16,640
and they're not listening then you're

857
00:31:16,640 --> 00:31:18,860
you're missing that on that you're on

858
00:31:18,860 --> 00:31:20,900
that front of curiosity you can also say

859
00:31:20,900 --> 00:31:22,430
well are there important elements that

860
00:31:22,430 --> 00:31:24,470
you're not sharing in the stand up then

861
00:31:24,470 --> 00:31:25,760
you might be missing transparency so

862
00:31:25,760 --> 00:31:28,070
it's a good test there and a fun game to

863
00:31:28,070 --> 00:31:30,020
play is to think gosh if we had some

864
00:31:30,020 --> 00:31:31,670
secret information somebody's holding a

865
00:31:31,670 --> 00:31:33,920
secret key and you've got an award if

866
00:31:33,920 --> 00:31:35,750
you found out what it was imagine that

867
00:31:35,750 --> 00:31:37,310
during the standoff your goal is to find

868
00:31:37,310 --> 00:31:39,020
out what that is and that's a fun game

869
00:31:39,020 --> 00:31:41,000
because it makes you be very curious

870
00:31:41,000 --> 00:31:43,040
about the other person and in fact it's

871
00:31:43,040 --> 00:31:45,020
usually true that there's some piece of

872
00:31:45,020 --> 00:31:46,730
information in the group that you don't

873
00:31:46,730 --> 00:31:47,870
know it's just that you don't know about

874
00:31:47,870 --> 00:31:52,010
it neither does the person I was

875
00:31:52,010 --> 00:31:53,780
fantastic thank you both so much for

876
00:31:53,780 --> 00:31:57,290
