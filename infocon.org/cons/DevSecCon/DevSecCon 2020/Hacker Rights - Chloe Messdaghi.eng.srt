all right everyone so we're going to

36
00:01:47,880 --> 00:01:49,740
talk about hacker rights today I'm very

37
00:01:49,740 --> 00:01:53,790
excited to do this with you so Who am I

38
00:01:53,790 --> 00:01:55,590
I am the VP of strategy over at point

39
00:01:55,590 --> 00:01:57,780
three security and when I'm not that I'm

40
00:01:57,780 --> 00:01:59,939
an ethical hacker advocate I'm meaning

41
00:01:59,939 --> 00:02:01,770
that I'm trying to fight for rights for

42
00:02:01,770 --> 00:02:04,619
all of us but also to try to bring

43
00:02:04,619 --> 00:02:07,260
rights to those they're underrepresented

44
00:02:07,260 --> 00:02:09,449
other than that I am the president

45
00:02:09,449 --> 00:02:12,810
co-founder of women of security what we

46
00:02:12,810 --> 00:02:14,640
said and also the founder woman hackers

47
00:02:14,640 --> 00:02:16,320
and when I'm not doing that I'm just a

48
00:02:16,320 --> 00:02:18,360
pirate to Sherlock and also you've

49
00:02:18,360 --> 00:02:19,890
probably heard of the hacker book club

50
00:02:19,890 --> 00:02:23,550
and as Ray said a little bit earlier I

51
00:02:23,550 --> 00:02:25,980
also run a podcast with itsc magazine

52
00:02:25,980 --> 00:02:28,740
alongside Alyssa Miller and Phil my late

53
00:02:28,740 --> 00:02:31,380
on the uncommon journey so let's dive

54
00:02:31,380 --> 00:02:35,670
into the depths now so this is a little

55
00:02:35,670 --> 00:02:37,320
picture of Sherlock I know she's

56
00:02:37,320 --> 00:02:38,730
adorable and she was about four months

57
00:02:38,730 --> 00:02:41,280
old in that photo we're gonna dive a

58
00:02:41,280 --> 00:02:42,690
little bit on the background of what's

59
00:02:42,690 --> 00:02:46,160
going on right now I'm also how why

60
00:02:46,160 --> 00:02:49,080
influencing the public I'll talk a

61
00:02:49,080 --> 00:02:50,850
little bit about the brain because I'm

62
00:02:50,850 --> 00:02:53,220
obsessed with the brain and we're gonna

63
00:02:53,220 --> 00:02:54,780
go into the role that the media plays

64
00:02:54,780 --> 00:02:57,870
the role organisations play and the role

65
00:02:57,870 --> 00:02:59,880
legislation place and what are the next

66
00:02:59,880 --> 00:03:03,930
steps that we can all do so what is the

67
00:03:03,930 --> 00:03:05,850
hacker usually we get this image right

68
00:03:05,850 --> 00:03:07,770
you know that person with the dark

69
00:03:07,770 --> 00:03:10,530
hoodie in the basement basically has

70
00:03:10,530 --> 00:03:12,900
like some sort of I don't know I want to

71
00:03:12,900 --> 00:03:15,030
say a superpower that they can see in

72
00:03:15,030 --> 00:03:18,390
the dark and sometimes we get this

73
00:03:18,390 --> 00:03:21,570
person you know because one cannot cover

74
00:03:21,570 --> 00:03:24,090
their camera on their computer so it

75
00:03:24,090 --> 00:03:25,530
must wear a ski mask

76
00:03:25,530 --> 00:03:27,450
and if you born a ski mask before it's

77
00:03:27,450 --> 00:03:29,489
super itchy it's not comfortable when

78
00:03:29,489 --> 00:03:32,310
you're looking for something but in

79
00:03:32,310 --> 00:03:34,830
reality hackers come in all shapes and

80
00:03:34,830 --> 00:03:38,790
size and hackers do wear different

81
00:03:38,790 --> 00:03:41,580
shades and I mean mostly you guys are

82
00:03:41,580 --> 00:03:43,530
aware of this of course but in case you

83
00:03:43,530 --> 00:03:45,870
don't overall hackers usually we're

84
00:03:45,870 --> 00:03:49,110
about three main type of hats usually

85
00:03:49,110 --> 00:03:51,540
you'll have a black hat a grey hat and a

86
00:03:51,540 --> 00:03:53,489
white hat but when I'm usually saying

87
00:03:53,489 --> 00:03:55,440
hacker I'm referring to the white hats

88
00:03:55,440 --> 00:03:58,170
you know the ethical hackers in general

89
00:03:58,170 --> 00:04:00,420
black hats commit malicious acts and are

90
00:04:00,420 --> 00:04:02,400
considered criminals and we probably

91
00:04:02,400 --> 00:04:03,600
should start calling them cyber

92
00:04:03,600 --> 00:04:07,140
criminals not hackers gray hats well

93
00:04:07,140 --> 00:04:10,709
there's too many shades to cover but in

94
00:04:10,709 --> 00:04:12,180
general there are people who are

95
00:04:12,180 --> 00:04:14,250
passionate about technology finding

96
00:04:14,250 --> 00:04:16,858
bones fixing bones and as such is it's

97
00:04:16,858 --> 00:04:19,260
what made them want to be a hacker

98
00:04:19,260 --> 00:04:21,329
and they just didn't know epical hacking

99
00:04:21,329 --> 00:04:24,600
existed sometimes and but most of the

100
00:04:24,600 --> 00:04:26,340
time when they do discover the ethical

101
00:04:26,340 --> 00:04:28,620
hacking does exist sometimes their hats

102
00:04:28,620 --> 00:04:31,470
do change from a shade of a gray to a

103
00:04:31,470 --> 00:04:33,420
white if they were previously a black

104
00:04:33,420 --> 00:04:38,150
hat so what are official hackers

105
00:04:38,150 --> 00:04:40,800
basically they are the hackers who work

106
00:04:40,800 --> 00:04:42,750
to keep data safe from attackers by

107
00:04:42,750 --> 00:04:44,370
finding system vulnerabilities that can

108
00:04:44,370 --> 00:04:46,530
be mitigated white hats are usually

109
00:04:46,530 --> 00:04:48,240
employed by a target systems owner and

110
00:04:48,240 --> 00:04:50,520
are typically paid sometimes quite well

111
00:04:50,520 --> 00:04:53,550
or sometimes they just good thank you so

112
00:04:53,550 --> 00:04:55,170
sphere rail but their work is not yet

113
00:04:55,170 --> 00:04:56,640
illegal because it's done with the

114
00:04:56,640 --> 00:05:02,900
system utters consent but even though

115
00:05:02,900 --> 00:05:07,230
they're if you see on this page I know

116
00:05:07,230 --> 00:05:09,330
it's a little bit hard to make out but

117
00:05:09,330 --> 00:05:11,430
on the left side is if you type into

118
00:05:11,430 --> 00:05:14,280
Google criminal hackers and then on the

119
00:05:14,280 --> 00:05:16,770
right side you see ethical hackers on

120
00:05:16,770 --> 00:05:18,930
the other side you kind of see the exact

121
00:05:18,930 --> 00:05:23,910
same images and this is bad thing for us

122
00:05:23,910 --> 00:05:28,470
and it's not just the pictures

123
00:05:28,470 --> 00:05:30,780
themselves but it's also the language

124
00:05:30,780 --> 00:05:33,030
that's being used in the media and by

125
00:05:33,030 --> 00:05:33,600
the media

126
00:05:33,600 --> 00:05:39,960
I made marketing and press and how does

127
00:05:39,960 --> 00:05:44,250
this imagery probably impact us well no

128
00:05:44,250 --> 00:05:45,900
I mean I'm going to dive into your brain

129
00:05:45,900 --> 00:05:49,410
now so how does imagery of impact us

130
00:05:49,410 --> 00:05:52,260
well let's just say that you've brought

131
00:05:52,260 --> 00:05:54,780
online your family your friends have

132
00:05:54,780 --> 00:05:57,450
read things about hackers and usually

133
00:05:57,450 --> 00:05:59,220
they see those images of someone in a

134
00:05:59,220 --> 00:06:01,590
dark hoodie maybe with a ski mask on top

135
00:06:01,590 --> 00:06:04,770
of it and just using the term hacker all

136
00:06:04,770 --> 00:06:08,220
the time for a criminal activity now

137
00:06:08,220 --> 00:06:10,530
this now turns into a socially

138
00:06:10,530 --> 00:06:13,620
constructed belief something that you

139
00:06:13,620 --> 00:06:16,380
basically were told by now someone who

140
00:06:16,380 --> 00:06:18,900
you look up to or someone that you know

141
00:06:18,900 --> 00:06:21,120
is well-respected so this could be the

142
00:06:21,120 --> 00:06:24,150
press this can be a teacher this could

143
00:06:24,150 --> 00:06:26,160
be an apparent or anything like that at

144
00:06:26,160 --> 00:06:29,160
any age but usually it's something found

145
00:06:29,160 --> 00:06:32,610
in the media we've noticed so what that

146
00:06:32,610 --> 00:06:33,360
does is

147
00:06:33,360 --> 00:06:36,180
that internalize putting people in

148
00:06:36,180 --> 00:06:38,789
categories of like us who's not like us

149
00:06:38,789 --> 00:06:42,360
so now what happens is that what we

150
00:06:42,360 --> 00:06:44,639
think of criminal we don't associate

151
00:06:44,639 --> 00:06:45,960
ourselves as criminals

152
00:06:45,960 --> 00:06:49,229
most of us hopefully and because of that

153
00:06:49,229 --> 00:06:52,139
we have now programmed that anyone who

154
00:06:52,139 --> 00:06:54,330
looks like a criminal is someone that's

155
00:06:54,330 --> 00:06:55,319
not safe

156
00:06:55,319 --> 00:06:57,689
and by not being safe meaning you go in

157
00:06:57,689 --> 00:07:00,180
a survival mode and this is found in the

158
00:07:00,180 --> 00:07:02,550
unconscious part of the amygdala which

159
00:07:02,550 --> 00:07:05,129
is the almond shape space that you see

160
00:07:05,129 --> 00:07:08,099
in this image that's lit up in a small

161
00:07:08,099 --> 00:07:09,930
little circle the amygdala is in there

162
00:07:09,930 --> 00:07:11,580
and within it is the temp

163
00:07:11,580 --> 00:07:13,199
I mean outside of it is the temporal

164
00:07:13,199 --> 00:07:15,599
lobe so the Magdala is our survival

165
00:07:15,599 --> 00:07:18,090
mechanism it's also known as the fight

166
00:07:18,090 --> 00:07:21,360
versus flight and this is really

167
00:07:21,360 --> 00:07:22,800
important to know because it's

168
00:07:22,800 --> 00:07:24,689
unconscious it's stuff that has been

169
00:07:24,689 --> 00:07:26,159
stored in your temporal lobe which

170
00:07:26,159 --> 00:07:28,590
stores your memory that you now are

171
00:07:28,590 --> 00:07:33,120
applying it as a fear tactic but the gun

172
00:07:33,120 --> 00:07:35,430
is that it has to check-in in the

173
00:07:35,430 --> 00:07:38,639
prefrontal cortex of your brain so when

174
00:07:38,639 --> 00:07:40,949
the megaliths I mean a warning warning

175
00:07:40,949 --> 00:07:44,099
distress signal to the prefrontal cortex

176
00:07:44,099 --> 00:07:46,620
it's basically checking in to say do I

177
00:07:46,620 --> 00:07:49,949
act on this does my body act on this do

178
00:07:49,949 --> 00:07:52,680
I do some sort of action and the

179
00:07:52,680 --> 00:07:54,599
prefrontal cortex kind of acts like the

180
00:07:54,599 --> 00:07:56,729
CEO of your brain it basically tells it

181
00:07:56,729 --> 00:08:02,400
to act or to calm down and so it is a

182
00:08:02,400 --> 00:08:05,939
very consciously aware process and

183
00:08:05,939 --> 00:08:07,860
that's the thing we all need to

184
00:08:07,860 --> 00:08:10,710
understand is that this is the time when

185
00:08:10,710 --> 00:08:13,830
you can question stereotypes and beliefs

186
00:08:13,830 --> 00:08:16,169
so anything that's socially constructed

187
00:08:16,169 --> 00:08:18,599
that is ingrained in your brain can be

188
00:08:18,599 --> 00:08:20,909
questioned and this is the most

189
00:08:20,909 --> 00:08:23,430
important thing to note because if

190
00:08:23,430 --> 00:08:27,120
someone tells you a story a story about

191
00:08:27,120 --> 00:08:29,849
someone who is an ethical hacker who's

192
00:08:29,849 --> 00:08:31,650
doing an incredible work that's

193
00:08:31,650 --> 00:08:34,260
protecting everyone every single day by

194
00:08:34,260 --> 00:08:36,719
finding a vulnerability that changes

195
00:08:36,719 --> 00:08:39,719
that message that changes everything

196
00:08:39,719 --> 00:08:41,969
so those that were fearing people that

197
00:08:41,969 --> 00:08:46,180
were hackers are are hackers it changes

198
00:08:46,180 --> 00:08:51,820
for them so just know that is that this

199
00:08:51,820 --> 00:08:53,620
is something very important for us to

200
00:08:53,620 --> 00:08:56,080
note if we want to change the way people

201
00:08:56,080 --> 00:08:59,530
look at the hacker community we need to

202
00:08:59,530 --> 00:09:02,170
share our stories we need people to

203
00:09:02,170 --> 00:09:04,360
understand there's a difference between

204
00:09:04,360 --> 00:09:07,920
a cyber criminal and ethical hacker and

205
00:09:07,920 --> 00:09:11,410
to note that it is a challenging road to

206
00:09:11,410 --> 00:09:14,200
do so but you yourself are able to

207
00:09:14,200 --> 00:09:17,470
question your biases and yes it's very

208
00:09:17,470 --> 00:09:19,360
hard to do that because it makes us feel

209
00:09:19,360 --> 00:09:21,010
very uncomfortable while we're looking

210
00:09:21,010 --> 00:09:23,260
at ourself that we are abroad especially

211
00:09:23,260 --> 00:09:25,150
if something is very much ingrained in

212
00:09:25,150 --> 00:09:27,460
everywhere you see I mean many of us

213
00:09:27,460 --> 00:09:30,130
that have a 10-block hat or our I say we

214
00:09:30,130 --> 00:09:32,530
look at the sales floor we see all these

215
00:09:32,530 --> 00:09:34,780
images of hackers as someone who's

216
00:09:34,780 --> 00:09:38,050
terrible and that's not what we want our

217
00:09:38,050 --> 00:09:41,470
image to be there's there's a huge

218
00:09:41,470 --> 00:09:44,350
difference between the two and we need

219
00:09:44,350 --> 00:09:49,360
to change that so the reason why we have

220
00:09:49,360 --> 00:09:51,640
this fear and what this is doing because

221
00:09:51,640 --> 00:09:53,730
we're not changing public awareness

222
00:09:53,730 --> 00:09:57,340
enough is that 93% of the Forbes Global

223
00:09:57,340 --> 00:10:00,340
2000 still don't have a Bonner ability

224
00:10:00,340 --> 00:10:03,850
disclosure program or a policy and 60%

225
00:10:03,850 --> 00:10:05,680
of hackers today do not report

226
00:10:05,680 --> 00:10:07,270
vulnerabilities and this is research

227
00:10:07,270 --> 00:10:09,400
that I've seen through I mean al sorry's

228
00:10:09,400 --> 00:10:12,700
work and the laws that we have all

229
00:10:12,700 --> 00:10:14,440
around the world are preventing good

230
00:10:14,440 --> 00:10:17,740
hacking and prosecuting ethical hackers

231
00:10:17,740 --> 00:10:20,440
and what's also happy is that we're

232
00:10:20,440 --> 00:10:21,910
seeing an increase in number of

233
00:10:21,910 --> 00:10:24,010
malicious hackers and you're probably

234
00:10:24,010 --> 00:10:27,090
wondering wait what let me explain

235
00:10:27,090 --> 00:10:29,410
sometimes people come into the field as

236
00:10:29,410 --> 00:10:31,690
ethical hacker or say they're more like

237
00:10:31,690 --> 00:10:33,910
great hats and what ends up happening is

238
00:10:33,910 --> 00:10:37,030
they submit a vulnerability and then

239
00:10:37,030 --> 00:10:38,290
they have to go through some sort of

240
00:10:38,290 --> 00:10:40,180
prosecution even though if it was within

241
00:10:40,180 --> 00:10:43,750
scope the amount of being basically

242
00:10:43,750 --> 00:10:46,810
having a high anxiety and also insomnia

243
00:10:46,810 --> 00:10:48,460
that's associated with that I could be

244
00:10:48,460 --> 00:10:50,740
prosecuted for doing something good it

245
00:10:50,740 --> 00:10:53,530
usually asks them the question which is

246
00:10:53,530 --> 00:10:56,250
then why am I still doing this and why

247
00:10:56,250 --> 00:10:58,170
not a black hat where I could get paid

248
00:10:58,170 --> 00:11:00,600
more if I'm just gonna have the exact

249
00:11:00,600 --> 00:11:03,420
same fears and this is something that

250
00:11:03,420 --> 00:11:05,400
I've seen when interviewing and

251
00:11:05,400 --> 00:11:09,240
researching black hat and gray hats so

252
00:11:09,240 --> 00:11:10,530
this is why it's really important that

253
00:11:10,530 --> 00:11:14,460
we start acting on this way and let me

254
00:11:14,460 --> 00:11:16,500
tell you a little bit about legislation

255
00:11:16,500 --> 00:11:18,810
now laws are very important for us to

256
00:11:18,810 --> 00:11:21,660
have anything changed and the thing to

257
00:11:21,660 --> 00:11:24,120
note about this is that all around the

258
00:11:24,120 --> 00:11:26,760
world we see these three things which is

259
00:11:26,760 --> 00:11:28,890
there's anti-hacking laws which in the

260
00:11:28,890 --> 00:11:32,880
u.s. we call it the CFAA on and then we

261
00:11:32,880 --> 00:11:34,890
have the anti-circumvention laws in

262
00:11:34,890 --> 00:11:36,570
Canada it's called the Copyright Act and

263
00:11:36,570 --> 00:11:38,100
the u.s. is called the Digital

264
00:11:38,100 --> 00:11:39,960
Millennium Copyright Act then we have

265
00:11:39,960 --> 00:11:43,110
acceptable use policy now what does an

266
00:11:43,110 --> 00:11:46,020
anti hacking law this is basically used

267
00:11:46,020 --> 00:11:50,250
when when someone access a computer

268
00:11:50,250 --> 00:11:53,180
without authorization or an excess of

269
00:11:53,180 --> 00:11:55,530
authorization and this is usually used

270
00:11:55,530 --> 00:11:57,450
when a researcher goes out of scope it

271
00:11:57,450 --> 00:12:02,180
is the Act used to prosecute hacking and

272
00:12:02,180 --> 00:12:05,910
a random fact but CFAA the reason it

273
00:12:05,910 --> 00:12:07,890
came about those Ronald Reagan's saw

274
00:12:07,890 --> 00:12:10,680
wargames and freaked out and decided we

275
00:12:10,680 --> 00:12:11,910
need to do something about this and

276
00:12:11,910 --> 00:12:13,380
provide stuff like this from happening

277
00:12:13,380 --> 00:12:15,480
and then you created an act and as we

278
00:12:15,480 --> 00:12:18,960
know overall creating anything out of

279
00:12:18,960 --> 00:12:21,089
fear base is never going to be a

280
00:12:21,089 --> 00:12:23,760
balanced item so let's go to

281
00:12:23,760 --> 00:12:26,010
anti-circumvention laws the Copyright

282
00:12:26,010 --> 00:12:28,350
Act so what our copyright acts is

283
00:12:28,350 --> 00:12:30,030
basically the right to repair that

284
00:12:30,030 --> 00:12:32,370
reverse engineering is seen as a breach

285
00:12:32,370 --> 00:12:36,560
of property acceptable use policy well

286
00:12:36,560 --> 00:12:39,240
let's just put this thing I know I know

287
00:12:39,240 --> 00:12:41,010
I want to ask the question but let's

288
00:12:41,010 --> 00:12:42,210
just pretend we're all in a room

289
00:12:42,210 --> 00:12:44,970
together how many guys in the room have

290
00:12:44,970 --> 00:12:47,040
ever read your terms and condition if

291
00:12:47,040 --> 00:12:50,910
you have an Apple product yeah I tried I

292
00:12:50,910 --> 00:12:52,680
got bored I decided to watch a movie

293
00:12:52,680 --> 00:12:55,230
instead but in general they can be very

294
00:12:55,230 --> 00:12:57,210
long too much verbage it can confuse

295
00:12:57,210 --> 00:12:59,550
anyone especially if English is not your

296
00:12:59,550 --> 00:13:01,200
first language and especially because

297
00:13:01,200 --> 00:13:03,810
none of us are pretty much attorneys and

298
00:13:03,810 --> 00:13:05,030
this can lead to some serious

299
00:13:05,030 --> 00:13:07,020
miscommunication the issues for ethical

300
00:13:07,020 --> 00:13:08,540
hackers that don't really speak

301
00:13:08,540 --> 00:13:11,540
English clearly these laws are very old

302
00:13:11,540 --> 00:13:13,370
and out-of-date and honestly we're

303
00:13:13,370 --> 00:13:16,250
creative fear not empathy by taking the

304
00:13:16,250 --> 00:13:18,080
time to understand what is needed while

305
00:13:18,080 --> 00:13:20,540
are should only prosecute malicious acts

306
00:13:20,540 --> 00:13:23,900
there's such as criminals and not good

307
00:13:23,900 --> 00:13:27,830
hackers and with improvements of

308
00:13:27,830 --> 00:13:30,830
legislation what we can see is a huge

309
00:13:30,830 --> 00:13:33,470
change overall with improvements

310
00:13:33,470 --> 00:13:35,330
legislation we can have all the Forbes

311
00:13:35,330 --> 00:13:36,530
Global 2000 have a vulnerability

312
00:13:36,530 --> 00:13:39,320
disclosure policy we can have a 100% of

313
00:13:39,320 --> 00:13:41,120
hackers can report vulnerabilities

314
00:13:41,120 --> 00:13:43,550
without having to worry about being

315
00:13:43,550 --> 00:13:46,460
prosecuted and having laws that

316
00:13:46,460 --> 00:13:48,800
encourage good hacking while prosecuting

317
00:13:48,800 --> 00:13:51,530
those that are are cyber criminals

318
00:13:51,530 --> 00:13:53,420
that's what we need and that's what we

319
00:13:53,420 --> 00:13:56,990
deserve and it's been since 1984 since

320
00:13:56,990 --> 00:13:59,300
we've been dealing with this and it's

321
00:13:59,300 --> 00:14:01,480
not just that boat it's just overall

322
00:14:01,480 --> 00:14:04,340
think about it if we start having all

323
00:14:04,340 --> 00:14:06,920
these laws that help people that want to

324
00:14:06,920 --> 00:14:09,290
be ethical hackers then maybe we might

325
00:14:09,290 --> 00:14:11,990
have less cyber criminals in the end and

326
00:14:11,990 --> 00:14:14,390
by cyber criminals that I'm talking to

327
00:14:14,390 --> 00:14:16,330
you are the ones that asked the question

328
00:14:16,330 --> 00:14:20,360
do I feel guilty if you feel guilt it

329
00:14:20,360 --> 00:14:22,580
will keep you up at night and that's the

330
00:14:22,580 --> 00:14:24,800
thing to always remember if you feel

331
00:14:24,800 --> 00:14:27,350
guilty at all if you have a conscious I

332
00:14:27,350 --> 00:14:32,090
want to work with you so if it's the

333
00:14:32,090 --> 00:14:32,960
public cycle

334
00:14:32,960 --> 00:14:35,150
so we've already dived into the brain so

335
00:14:35,150 --> 00:14:36,770
you know that they McDonough you know

336
00:14:36,770 --> 00:14:39,710
that we have this situation now you know

337
00:14:39,710 --> 00:14:42,290
the landscape but to be able to

338
00:14:42,290 --> 00:14:44,120
influence the public cycle we need to

339
00:14:44,120 --> 00:14:46,820
make sure we have the media organization

340
00:14:46,820 --> 00:14:50,270
and legislation involved because all in

341
00:14:50,270 --> 00:14:53,450
all they actually work with each other

342
00:14:53,450 --> 00:14:57,230
we need to push the press to be more

343
00:14:57,230 --> 00:14:59,300
aware of the words that they use

344
00:14:59,300 --> 00:15:01,250
we need them to change the language and

345
00:15:01,250 --> 00:15:03,380
imagery of what is a hacker and start

346
00:15:03,380 --> 00:15:06,740
having them use the term cyber criminals

347
00:15:06,740 --> 00:15:09,470
to those who commit unethical hacking

348
00:15:09,470 --> 00:15:11,120
overall we really need to separate the

349
00:15:11,120 --> 00:15:16,850
two and when it comes to organization we

350
00:15:16,850 --> 00:15:18,950
need to have the public opinion and for

351
00:15:18,950 --> 00:15:20,570
them to step up with

352
00:15:20,570 --> 00:15:22,490
the media right when they talked to the

353
00:15:22,490 --> 00:15:24,920
media to let them know that they need to

354
00:15:24,920 --> 00:15:27,230
change the way that they stand and that

355
00:15:27,230 --> 00:15:29,270
this is incorrect language incorrect

356
00:15:29,270 --> 00:15:32,150
imageries but also because organizations

357
00:15:32,150 --> 00:15:36,050
are the usually the the pushers to get

358
00:15:36,050 --> 00:15:38,150
new legislation in and we need a

359
00:15:38,150 --> 00:15:40,700
motivate Capitol Hill in the u.s. to get

360
00:15:40,700 --> 00:15:42,530
on board and to update our current

361
00:15:42,530 --> 00:15:44,540
legislation that will protect the

362
00:15:44,540 --> 00:15:48,260
community and overall we need all three

363
00:15:48,260 --> 00:15:49,940
of them to be able to support hacker

364
00:15:49,940 --> 00:15:54,500
rights to become a reality so the five

365
00:15:54,500 --> 00:15:56,720
needs overall we need to change our

366
00:15:56,720 --> 00:15:58,520
language and imagery and InfoSec we need

367
00:15:58,520 --> 00:15:59,960
to work with the media we need to say to

368
00:15:59,960 --> 00:16:01,940
notice that everyday heroes you need

369
00:16:01,940 --> 00:16:03,350
organizations to have a vulnerability

370
00:16:03,350 --> 00:16:06,320
disclosure program and we definitely be

371
00:16:06,320 --> 00:16:08,150
representatives to update today's

372
00:16:08,150 --> 00:16:12,530
legislation and the first step together

373
00:16:12,530 --> 00:16:15,200
them asking for everyone here right now

374
00:16:15,200 --> 00:16:17,630
is to help me by signing this petition

375
00:16:17,630 --> 00:16:20,510
this petition was created in the very

376
00:16:20,510 --> 00:16:23,510
last week of February and it breaks it

377
00:16:23,510 --> 00:16:25,880
down from what I have shown you it talks

378
00:16:25,880 --> 00:16:28,010
about organizations and asking from to

379
00:16:28,010 --> 00:16:29,990
implement policies that clearly define

380
00:16:29,990 --> 00:16:33,020
scope what kind of any rewards contact

381
00:16:33,020 --> 00:16:35,330
information communicate updates on

382
00:16:35,330 --> 00:16:36,860
submission and the extension of a

383
00:16:36,860 --> 00:16:38,810
bilateral trust to include non

384
00:16:38,810 --> 00:16:40,940
retribution this is very important

385
00:16:40,940 --> 00:16:41,810
because I don't know about you but

386
00:16:41,810 --> 00:16:43,160
there's times where you want to submit a

387
00:16:43,160 --> 00:16:45,770
vulnerability it takes hours to find the

388
00:16:45,770 --> 00:16:47,930
contact information not just that

389
00:16:47,930 --> 00:16:49,730
sometimes it actually takes some days

390
00:16:49,730 --> 00:16:51,140
and then you get to a point where is

391
00:16:51,140 --> 00:16:53,270
like do I even want to take this risk

392
00:16:53,270 --> 00:16:57,230
and then we break into politicians we

393
00:16:57,230 --> 00:16:59,920
want to have politicians get to know us

394
00:16:59,920 --> 00:17:02,390
instead of seeing us as a cyber no

395
00:17:02,390 --> 00:17:05,390
there's an important in the media we

396
00:17:05,390 --> 00:17:07,699
need them to see and understand us and

397
00:17:07,699 --> 00:17:08,900
the only way they're going to be able to

398
00:17:08,900 --> 00:17:10,910
do that is by hearing our stories and

399
00:17:10,910 --> 00:17:13,099
for us and to get our family and friends

400
00:17:13,099 --> 00:17:16,280
to push to support us too as well and

401
00:17:16,280 --> 00:17:18,829
then we ask for the media of course to

402
00:17:18,829 --> 00:17:20,390
stop returning ethical hackers as

403
00:17:20,390 --> 00:17:22,849
malicious actors change the imagery and

404
00:17:22,849 --> 00:17:24,530
when reporting on malicious act of

405
00:17:24,530 --> 00:17:25,160
hacking

406
00:17:25,160 --> 00:17:27,079
please refer them as separate criminals

407
00:17:27,079 --> 00:17:30,200
and not hackers and then of course I had

408
00:17:30,200 --> 00:17:31,190
to add something about the hacker

409
00:17:31,190 --> 00:17:33,720
community and I want to please

410
00:17:33,720 --> 00:17:35,700
say this over and over please think

411
00:17:35,700 --> 00:17:38,220
within scope and please don't exploit

412
00:17:38,220 --> 00:17:40,529
because when you do that you break a

413
00:17:40,529 --> 00:17:44,639
trust with everyone in the end and there

414
00:17:44,639 --> 00:17:46,470
is a couple of other details at the

415
00:17:46,470 --> 00:17:47,039
bottom

416
00:17:47,039 --> 00:17:49,649
check out disclose that I owe to see

417
00:17:49,649 --> 00:17:51,690
what are some programs that are trying

418
00:17:51,690 --> 00:17:55,529
to do as much as possible by coming up

419
00:17:55,529 --> 00:17:57,450
with things that can actually have

420
00:17:57,450 --> 00:18:00,179
protection for you and then last but at

421
00:18:00,179 --> 00:18:01,950
least I also put a line in there the

422
00:18:01,950 --> 00:18:03,690
black hoodie and like cut out ski mask

423
00:18:03,690 --> 00:18:05,580
because it's starting at your TV I don't

424
00:18:05,580 --> 00:18:06,929
know about you guys but definitely your

425
00:18:06,929 --> 00:18:09,899
tasting now so the main takeaways

426
00:18:09,899 --> 00:18:12,120
ethical hacker deserve protection and

427
00:18:12,120 --> 00:18:15,149
rights we do and the current imagery and

428
00:18:15,149 --> 00:18:16,710
language has been misleading the public

429
00:18:16,710 --> 00:18:20,399
and is still making them fear us and we

430
00:18:20,399 --> 00:18:22,649
made a change that fear-based thinking

431
00:18:22,649 --> 00:18:24,750
we need them to have their prefrontal

432
00:18:24,750 --> 00:18:26,789
cortex to be able to cushion their and

433
00:18:26,789 --> 00:18:30,090
migdal a subconscious thoughts and we

434
00:18:30,090 --> 00:18:31,529
need to work together to change the

435
00:18:31,529 --> 00:18:33,090
public's perception by acting

436
00:18:33,090 --> 00:18:36,600
legislation media and organizations but

437
00:18:36,600 --> 00:18:38,759
most importantly also sign and share the

438
00:18:38,759 --> 00:18:40,590
petition because when I get a thousand

439
00:18:40,590 --> 00:18:42,659
signatures I could then go and take it

440
00:18:42,659 --> 00:18:44,580
to government I could then take it to

441
00:18:44,580 --> 00:18:46,710
organizations I could do a lot of work

442
00:18:46,710 --> 00:18:48,539
but I needed get at least a thousand

443
00:18:48,539 --> 00:18:50,879
signatures a most important you could

444
00:18:50,879 --> 00:18:55,320
always share this talk but I really do

445
00:18:55,320 --> 00:18:56,700
want to say that the change really

446
00:18:56,700 --> 00:18:58,950
starts with you and me so after this

447
00:18:58,950 --> 00:19:01,320
talk if you can look at what you're

448
00:19:01,320 --> 00:19:04,259
doing that can help the community out by

449
00:19:04,259 --> 00:19:06,210
looking at what you can do at this very

450
00:19:06,210 --> 00:19:08,730
moment to try to change the situation

451
00:19:08,730 --> 00:19:11,220
because it's going to take all of us to

452
00:19:11,220 --> 00:19:13,320
push for a change and it's going to take

453
00:19:13,320 --> 00:19:16,500
people besides us that means we need to

454
00:19:16,500 --> 00:19:18,600
even go outside of InfoSec to bring

455
00:19:18,600 --> 00:19:22,529
about that I want to list some resources

456
00:19:22,529 --> 00:19:26,190
for you so the itsp magazine podcast is

457

the top and then there is a program that

472
00:20:10,890 --> 00:20:13,289
I do with mental health hackers which is

473
00:20:13,289 --> 00:20:16,140
providing a forum for people to

474
00:20:16,140 --> 00:20:19,080
volunteer to basically be connected with

475
00:20:19,080 --> 00:20:21,299
other people that are feeling like they

476
00:20:21,299 --> 00:20:22,770
want to talk to someone or make a new

477
00:20:22,770 --> 00:20:24,690
friends so they give a penpal during

478
00:20:24,690 --> 00:20:27,659

479
00:20:27,659 --> 00:20:28,710
there's a lot of people that are feeling

480
00:20:28,710 --> 00:20:30,480
and isolated in the lone and could

481
00:20:30,480 --> 00:20:33,240

00:21:06,450 --> 00:21:08,100
may have ignored everything that I just

496
00:21:08,100 --> 00:21:11,010
talked about but those last four right

497
00:21:11,010 --> 00:21:13,799

everyone you know that's gonna be the

500
00:21:18,299 --> 00:21:19,919
most beneficial thing that you could do

501
00:21:19,919 --> 00:21:22,740
from this talk because at the NA if you

502
00:21:22,740 --> 00:21:24,000
don't want to believe in the petition

503
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:25,289
it's okay if you don't believe in

504
00:21:25,289 --> 00:21:27,210
ethical rights that's okay but right now

505
00:21:27,210 --> 00:21:30,240
we're in Cove in nineteen and those four

506
00:21:30,240 --> 00:21:31,890
things can actually save someone's life

507
00:21:31,890 --> 00:21:35,549

526
00:22:20,019 --> 00:22:21,610
hours congratulations

527

this is so awesome I'm going to stop

528
00:22:25,029 --> 00:22:26,980
sharing my screen and I'm gonna bring

529
00:22:26,980 --> 00:22:28,899
Sherlock over on my lap and I'm gonna

530
00:22:28,899 --> 00:22:31,179
answer any questions that you guys may

531
00:22:31,179 --> 00:22:33,039
have all right so Chloe we're gonna

532
00:22:33,039 --> 00:22:34,779
start with mine because I get to I get

533
00:22:34,779 --> 00:22:36,070
to be in charge of this until the break

534
00:22:36,070 --> 00:22:39,820
okay first and foremost the laws look a

535
00:22:39,820 --> 00:22:41,580
little creaky they look a little old

536
00:22:41,580 --> 00:22:44,769
long in the tooth if you will right and

537
00:22:44,769 --> 00:22:48,539
I've noticed that there's been a lot of

538
00:22:48,539 --> 00:22:51,130
news around cybersecurity in the last

539
00:22:51,130 --> 00:22:52,720
few weeks right as since the post

540
00:22:52,720 --> 00:22:55,480
Dimmick or post pandemic world the news

541
00:22:55,480 --> 00:22:57,159
media is really harping on people that

542
00:22:57,159 --> 00:22:58,269
are taking advantage of it for

543
00:22:58,269 --> 00:23:01,659
ransomware or for scams are we in danger

544
00:23:01,659 --> 00:23:04,450
of any rushed legislation being kind of

545
00:23:04,450 --> 00:23:06,789
crammed through to address some of those

546
00:23:06,789 --> 00:23:09,549
um so talk to a few politicians about

547
00:23:09,549 --> 00:23:11,110
this and this is a concern that they

548
00:23:11,110 --> 00:23:13,659
have and the other concern that they

549
00:23:13,659 --> 00:23:15,760
also have is people are dropping 0 days

550
00:23:15,760 --> 00:23:18,549
like never before and which is great for

551
00:23:18,549 --> 00:23:20,019
us because we're like hey you need to

552
00:23:20,019 --> 00:23:21,399
know about this you gotta take security

553
00:23:21,399 --> 00:23:23,559
seriously and I'm hoping that pushes

554
00:23:23,559 --> 00:23:25,779
those Forbes 2000 companies to be like

555
00:23:25,779 --> 00:23:27,309
you know what maybe wishes look into a

556
00:23:27,309 --> 00:23:31,779
VDP program but overall we have to be

557
00:23:31,779 --> 00:23:36,549
very I think overall take away on this

558
00:23:36,549 --> 00:23:39,490
one is start doing activities if us the

559
00:23:39,490 --> 00:23:41,200
hacker community can do anything to help

560
00:23:41,200 --> 00:23:44,830
outside InfoSec and within InfoSec for

561
00:23:44,830 --> 00:23:46,720
anyone around the world to be able to

562
00:23:46,720 --> 00:23:49,029
see that we're there we're supporting

563
00:23:49,029 --> 00:23:50,950
and we're good people and we're just

564
00:23:50,950 --> 00:23:53,200
trying to help I think that changes the

565
00:23:53,200 --> 00:23:54,909
narrative of what people are thinking or

566
00:23:54,909 --> 00:23:57,309
what we are like do you think there's

567
00:23:57,309 --> 00:23:59,110
any major lessons that we could learn

568
00:23:59,110 --> 00:24:00,909
from the fact that most of our parents

569
00:24:00,909 --> 00:24:02,679
and cousins and brother-in-law's all

570
00:24:02,679 --> 00:24:04,929
started using zoom last week right when

571
00:24:04,929 --> 00:24:07,090
the zoom vulnerabilities were coming out

572
00:24:07,090 --> 00:24:09,610
oh it's great because now you're having

573
00:24:09,610 --> 00:24:12,400
that conversation I stood you up

574
00:24:12,400 --> 00:24:14,480
it's funny because you'll always have

575
00:24:14,480 --> 00:24:16,250
like did the parents or the family loans

576
00:24:16,250 --> 00:24:18,350
like oh I'm like what was last time you

577
00:24:18,350 --> 00:24:22,940
updated your phone no like okay Oh or

578
00:24:22,940 --> 00:24:25,309
they're like oh yeah oh there's updates

579
00:24:25,309 --> 00:24:27,710
oh yeah I never I always forget about

580
00:24:27,710 --> 00:24:30,830
this but now they're like Oh zoom that

581
00:24:30,830 --> 00:24:33,740
and I use that every day I actually I'm

582
00:24:33,740 --> 00:24:35,380
going to start paying attention to it

583
00:24:35,380 --> 00:24:37,309
now we are getting quite a few questions

584
00:24:37,309 --> 00:24:39,740
for Sherlock but I don't have any means

585
00:24:39,740 --> 00:24:42,170
of asking sure like the questions so I'm

586
00:24:42,170 --> 00:24:44,120
just gonna ignore those there is a

587
00:24:44,120 --> 00:24:46,550
question from the slide Oh could

588
00:24:46,550 --> 00:24:50,330
something like see eh authorised and

589
00:24:50,330 --> 00:24:52,220
that's a certified ethical hacker the

590
00:24:52,220 --> 00:24:54,920
program could that authorize a hacker

591
00:24:54,920 --> 00:24:57,470
could it protect the hacker from

592
00:24:57,470 --> 00:25:01,570
prosecution I'm not an attorney myself

593
00:25:01,570 --> 00:25:06,890
but just note that it's always

594
00:25:06,890 --> 00:25:08,360
challenging because it depends on the

595
00:25:08,360 --> 00:25:10,160
organization it depends on their legal

596
00:25:10,160 --> 00:25:12,980
team we have actually seen people that

597
00:25:12,980 --> 00:25:16,040
stayed within scope game prosecuted so

598
00:25:16,040 --> 00:25:18,410
even if you are ethical hacker you have

599
00:25:18,410 --> 00:25:20,450
a certification of it or you're part of

600
00:25:20,450 --> 00:25:22,460
an organization of it and as well and

601
00:25:22,460 --> 00:25:23,450
recognized or whatnot

602
00:25:23,450 --> 00:25:26,660
you're still endangered so just always

603
00:25:26,660 --> 00:25:29,540
keep that in mind I always tell people

604
00:25:29,540 --> 00:25:31,970
if someone has like a bug bounty public

605
00:25:31,970 --> 00:25:35,660
program or a VDP program or Alice on

606
00:25:35,660 --> 00:25:37,550
disclose that I oh I feel like that's a

607
00:25:37,550 --> 00:25:39,260
little bit safer for you usually to

608
00:25:39,260 --> 00:25:42,470
report something if not I feel like ask

609
00:25:42,470 --> 00:25:44,960
around and see what people say when

610
00:25:44,960 --> 00:25:47,080
you're reporting any vulnerability

611
00:25:47,080 --> 00:25:51,350
honestly stay safe in other words and we

612
00:25:51,350 --> 00:25:52,940
did also have quite a few people asking

613
00:25:52,940 --> 00:25:55,010
about the petition on change.org that is

614
00:25:55,010 --> 00:25:57,590
linked now in the in the all the talks

615
00:25:57,590 --> 00:26:00,200
slack so you can get to it there we also

616
00:26:00,200 --> 00:26:02,660
have a screenshot of some of the

617
00:26:02,660 --> 00:26:05,330
