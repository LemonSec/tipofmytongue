the time my name is Nicole Hoffman I'm

18
00:00:56,250 --> 00:00:58,230
giving a presentation on applying fraud

19
00:00:58,230 --> 00:01:00,469
detection techniques to hunt adversaries

20
00:01:00,469 --> 00:01:02,969
just to introduce the topic a little bit

21
00:01:02,969 --> 00:01:05,549
more it I am going to be speaking a lot

22
00:01:05,549 --> 00:01:07,470
about financial crimes and fraud

23
00:01:07,470 --> 00:01:10,049
detection but it is first and foremost a

24
00:01:10,049 --> 00:01:12,420
hunting story so if you're interested in

25
00:01:12,420 --> 00:01:14,729
threat hunting or you're interested in

26
00:01:14,729 --> 00:01:17,250
getting into the field stick around

27
00:01:17,250 --> 00:01:18,780
because it's it's going to be a great

28
00:01:18,780 --> 00:01:25,020
story so just a little bit of background

29
00:01:25,020 --> 00:01:28,470
on myself I am a threat research analyst

30
00:01:28,470 --> 00:01:31,829
colonel currently at shadow scape I've

31
00:01:31,829 --> 00:01:33,799
been in the field for about two years

32
00:01:33,799 --> 00:01:36,170
I'm currently a senior in college

33
00:01:36,170 --> 00:01:38,070
pursuing a bachelor's in information

34
00:01:38,070 --> 00:01:42,810
technology early in my college career I

35
00:01:42,810 --> 00:01:44,909
was a fraud analyst for a financial

36
00:01:44,909 --> 00:01:47,820
institution when I'm not working I am

37
00:01:47,820 --> 00:01:50,909
usually doing Crossfit or kayaking or

38
00:01:50,909 --> 00:01:55,049
spending time with my family so just to

39
00:01:55,049 --> 00:01:57,659
go over the agenda I am going to give

40
00:01:57,659 --> 00:02:00,500
some background on Financial Crimes and

41
00:02:00,500 --> 00:02:04,710
the life of a fraud analyst and then I'm

42
00:02:04,710 --> 00:02:09,030
going to be going over some pain points

43
00:02:09,030 --> 00:02:11,760
that led me to a more proactive approach

44
00:02:11,760 --> 00:02:13,810
in the hunt and

45
00:02:13,810 --> 00:02:15,060
I'm going to be applying those

46
00:02:15,060 --> 00:02:17,650
methodologies to the cyber domain and

47
00:02:17,650 --> 00:02:21,190
just as a note any time I mention the

48
00:02:21,190 --> 00:02:23,110
name Carol just know that she's the

49
00:02:23,110 --> 00:02:25,900
adversary it was just easier to give her

50
00:02:25,900 --> 00:02:30,250
a name for this scenario so there's a

51
00:02:30,250 --> 00:02:31,569
lot of different types of financial

52
00:02:31,569 --> 00:02:33,400
crimes that fraud analysts are

53
00:02:33,400 --> 00:02:35,470
responsible for detecting in their

54
00:02:35,470 --> 00:02:38,110
environment credit card fraud typically

55
00:02:38,110 --> 00:02:43,569
occurs when there's a card skimmer onic

56
00:02:43,569 --> 00:02:45,220
you know it's typically on a gas station

57
00:02:45,220 --> 00:02:49,989
or people steal credit card numbers from

58
00:02:49,989 --> 00:02:51,730
a POS system and sell them on the dark

59
00:02:51,730 --> 00:02:54,220
web all that is included in credit card

60
00:02:54,220 --> 00:02:56,670
fraud check fraud could be anywhere from

61
00:02:56,670 --> 00:03:00,209
stealing checks forging signatures

62
00:03:00,209 --> 00:03:03,069
printing your own checks check kiting

63
00:03:03,069 --> 00:03:04,510
which we're going to get into in a

64
00:03:04,510 --> 00:03:07,080
little bit or writing a check on a

65
00:03:07,080 --> 00:03:10,630
closed account is considered check fraud

66
00:03:10,630 --> 00:03:13,569
money laundering is considered cleaning

67
00:03:13,569 --> 00:03:16,120
dirty money which is essentially taking

68
00:03:16,120 --> 00:03:17,890
money that has been obtained illegally

69
00:03:17,890 --> 00:03:20,290
and trying to make it seem like it has a

70
00:03:20,290 --> 00:03:22,299
legal origin like through a legitimate

71
00:03:22,299 --> 00:03:24,940
business terrorist finding is pretty

72
00:03:24,940 --> 00:03:28,959
straightforward any terrorist funding is

73
00:03:28,959 --> 00:03:30,720
considered a crime and it is a

74
00:03:30,720 --> 00:03:33,970
fraudulent act embezzlement

75
00:03:33,970 --> 00:03:36,160
anytime someone is put into a place of

76
00:03:36,160 --> 00:03:39,700
trust with foreign organizations funds

77
00:03:39,700 --> 00:03:42,760
such an such as an accountant a chief

78
00:03:42,760 --> 00:03:45,280
financial officer if they miss use those

79
00:03:45,280 --> 00:03:47,019
funds or steal those funds it's

80
00:03:47,019 --> 00:03:49,720
considered embezzlement when I was a

81
00:03:49,720 --> 00:03:52,810
fraud analyst while I did try to detect

82
00:03:52,810 --> 00:03:54,910
all of these different types of crimes I

83
00:03:54,910 --> 00:03:59,350
mainly focused on check fraud and a lot

84
00:03:59,350 --> 00:04:00,880
of people don't know the path that a

85
00:04:00,880 --> 00:04:03,400
check takes after it's deposited so I

86
00:04:03,400 --> 00:04:05,200
wanted to go over that because a lot of

87
00:04:05,200 --> 00:04:06,940
out of series like to take advantage of

88
00:04:06,940 --> 00:04:09,250
that so it's kind of important for the

89
00:04:09,250 --> 00:04:11,739
presentation so I don't know about you

90
00:04:11,739 --> 00:04:14,290
but when I was little my grandma used to

91
00:04:14,290 --> 00:04:15,670
give me a check every Christmas for

92
00:04:15,670 --> 00:04:19,450
$5.00 since she would stick it in my my

93
00:04:19,450 --> 00:04:23,470
stocking and so in this scenario I'm the

94
00:04:23,470 --> 00:04:25,060
receiver of the check so I would be the

95
00:04:25,060 --> 00:04:27,550
payee and my grandma would be the payer

96
00:04:27,550 --> 00:04:29,710
who wrote the check so I would deposit

97
00:04:29,710 --> 00:04:32,349
the check into my bank my bank would

98
00:04:32,349 --> 00:04:33,849
process the cheque and send it to the

99
00:04:33,849 --> 00:04:35,949
Federal Reserve the Federal Reserve

100
00:04:35,949 --> 00:04:38,379
would then send it to my grandma the

101
00:04:38,379 --> 00:04:41,440
payers bank and request the funds if her

102
00:04:41,440 --> 00:04:43,509
the funds are available her account

103
00:04:43,509 --> 00:04:45,370
would be debited and if the funds were

104
00:04:45,370 --> 00:04:47,199
not available then they would send a

105
00:04:47,199 --> 00:04:49,270
response back through the Federal

106
00:04:49,270 --> 00:04:51,669
Reserve and then the Federal Reserve

107
00:04:51,669 --> 00:04:53,800
would process those funds and send it to

108
00:04:53,800 --> 00:04:56,440
my bank account and the amount of time

109
00:04:56,440 --> 00:04:58,389
it takes for me to deposit the checks

110
00:04:58,389 --> 00:05:00,039
and either receive the funds or the

111
00:05:00,039 --> 00:05:02,319
message that there's no funds available

112
00:05:02,319 --> 00:05:05,139
that's known as the float and it's the

113
00:05:05,139 --> 00:05:07,300
time period and a lot of adversaries

114
00:05:07,300 --> 00:05:09,219
take advantage of this time period that

115
00:05:09,219 --> 00:05:12,520
we'll get into in a little bit so my

116
00:05:12,520 --> 00:05:15,219
department in fraud was very

117
00:05:15,219 --> 00:05:16,060
understaffed

118
00:05:16,060 --> 00:05:19,449
we had very little resources we didn't

119
00:05:19,449 --> 00:05:20,979
have a lot of tools it was a smaller

120
00:05:20,979 --> 00:05:24,400
organization and half my day was spent

121
00:05:24,400 --> 00:05:27,039
reviewing hundreds of check deposits

122
00:05:27,039 --> 00:05:28,719
every check that was deposited into the

123
00:05:28,719 --> 00:05:30,909
organization had to be checked manually

124
00:05:30,909 --> 00:05:34,029
for fraud and I had to make sure I

125
00:05:34,029 --> 00:05:36,430
didn't need to place a check on hold to

126
00:05:36,430 --> 00:05:38,409
cover the float time if say they didn't

127
00:05:38,409 --> 00:05:40,569
have the funds to cover the check if the

128
00:05:40,569 --> 00:05:42,340
check I had to ensure the check was a

129
00:05:42,340 --> 00:05:43,990
legitimate check and not a fraudulent

130
00:05:43,990 --> 00:05:46,090
check I also had to make sure there

131
00:05:46,090 --> 00:05:49,000
wasn't a forged signature and so it

132
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:51,430
could be a very daunting task manually

133
00:05:51,430 --> 00:05:53,620
staring at thousands of checks and you

134
00:05:53,620 --> 00:05:55,389
really only have a certain time period

135
00:05:55,389 --> 00:05:57,310
that you can spend on each check and

136
00:05:57,310 --> 00:05:59,590
when I was done with that task then I

137
00:05:59,590 --> 00:06:01,629
went into reviewing potential fraud

138
00:06:01,629 --> 00:06:05,080
alerts and fraud alerts are very similar

139
00:06:05,080 --> 00:06:07,569
to the alerts that you would see as like

140
00:06:07,569 --> 00:06:10,449
a sock analyst there's a lot of false

141
00:06:10,449 --> 00:06:12,400
positives and it could quickly lead to

142
00:06:12,400 --> 00:06:14,469
fatigue or excuse me

143
00:06:14,469 --> 00:06:19,060
alert fatigue and the reason being is

144
00:06:19,060 --> 00:06:21,639
because you know you're spending so much

145
00:06:21,639 --> 00:06:23,860
time chasing these false positives when

146
00:06:23,860 --> 00:06:26,080
you really want to be spending time

147
00:06:26,080 --> 00:06:27,879
doing your job that you were trying to

148
00:06:27,879 --> 00:06:30,370
do and it could get really defeating so

149
00:06:30,370 --> 00:06:33,159
I really wanted to start doing something

150
00:06:33,159 --> 00:06:34,629
different something had to change

151
00:06:34,629 --> 00:06:37,630
because you know my mind was already

152
00:06:37,630 --> 00:06:39,490
going crazy reviewing all these checks

153
00:06:39,490 --> 00:06:41,200
and then to go into alerts with this

154
00:06:41,200 --> 00:06:43,660
amount of due diligence it was just I

155
00:06:43,660 --> 00:06:45,640
felt like I wasn't getting anywhere so

156
00:06:45,640 --> 00:06:48,970
the first thing I did was review our

157
00:06:48,970 --> 00:06:51,460
current toolset I was a little bit more

158
00:06:51,460 --> 00:06:53,680
technical than the other people in my

159
00:06:53,680 --> 00:06:57,310
team and so I knew there was a lot in

160
00:06:57,310 --> 00:06:59,770
the tool that we weren't using so one of

161
00:06:59,770 --> 00:07:01,510
the things that I noticed that had been

162
00:07:01,510 --> 00:07:03,130
turned on already for a while and I

163
00:07:03,130 --> 00:07:05,380
think maybe they had forgot about it

164
00:07:05,380 --> 00:07:08,440
was a machine learning feature that

165
00:07:08,440 --> 00:07:10,750
tried to make a baseline of normal user

166
00:07:10,750 --> 00:07:15,250
activity and I started reviewing those

167
00:07:15,250 --> 00:07:17,680
alerts and it was great I was actually

168
00:07:17,680 --> 00:07:21,100
able to identify a few fraud activities

169
00:07:21,100 --> 00:07:25,210
but then I realized after informing my

170
00:07:25,210 --> 00:07:27,490
team about this new feature I increased

171
00:07:27,490 --> 00:07:29,590
my workload which then increased my

172
00:07:29,590 --> 00:07:31,750
false positives so now it was like I was

173
00:07:31,750 --> 00:07:35,890
reviewing three alert sets and it just

174
00:07:35,890 --> 00:07:38,020
wasn't enough I still felt like we could

175
00:07:38,020 --> 00:07:40,120
be bit more proactive so I decided to

176
00:07:40,120 --> 00:07:44,320
narrow our focus and focus just on one

177
00:07:44,320 --> 00:07:46,960
specific crime which is check hiding

178
00:07:46,960 --> 00:07:48,970
because we are very familiar with this

179
00:07:48,970 --> 00:07:52,720
crime and it happened quite often so

180
00:07:52,720 --> 00:07:54,940
bringing Carol into the story to discuss

181
00:07:54,940 --> 00:07:58,630
what check kiting is let's say Carol has

182
00:07:58,630 --> 00:07:59,620
two bank accounts

183
00:07:59,620 --> 00:08:01,840
she has an account at Bank a and an

184
00:08:01,840 --> 00:08:04,840
account at Bank B both accounts have $0

185
00:08:04,840 --> 00:08:07,060
however Carol decides she's going to

186
00:08:07,060 --> 00:08:11,350
write a check from Bank a for $200 she's

187
00:08:11,350 --> 00:08:12,730
then going to deposit the check

188
00:08:12,730 --> 00:08:15,370
typically into the ATM making the

189
00:08:15,370 --> 00:08:18,010
balance now $200 and then she's going to

190
00:08:18,010 --> 00:08:20,770
take the funds immediately out and then

191
00:08:20,770 --> 00:08:22,870
she'll get away with the money the

192
00:08:22,870 --> 00:08:24,610
reason she's able to do that is two

193
00:08:24,610 --> 00:08:26,350
reasons she's taking advantage of the

194
00:08:26,350 --> 00:08:28,300
float and the reason she's immediately

195
00:08:28,300 --> 00:08:30,940
allowed to take the cash out is because

196
00:08:30,940 --> 00:08:33,070
of the expedited funds availability act

197
00:08:33,070 --> 00:08:36,370
which says that the the first $200 of

198
00:08:36,370 --> 00:08:38,409
checks have to be made available the

199
00:08:38,409 --> 00:08:41,200
next day or typically most institutions

200
00:08:41,200 --> 00:08:46,000
will make it right away and so when you

201
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:48,220
see check kiting it's typically in $200

202
00:08:48,220 --> 00:08:51,250
increments because of that and the best

203
00:08:51,250 --> 00:08:54,850
example of check ID that I've ever seen

204
00:08:54,850 --> 00:08:56,560
if you've ever heard of the movie catch

205
00:08:56,560 --> 00:08:59,680
me if you can it's a true story has

206
00:08:59,680 --> 00:09:01,360
Leonardo DiCaprio and he plays a

207
00:09:01,360 --> 00:09:05,019
character Frank Abagnale jr. and he was

208
00:09:05,019 --> 00:09:08,050
a master of deception he's he's still

209
00:09:08,050 --> 00:09:10,630
he's 71 today and he's still an

210
00:09:10,630 --> 00:09:13,420
informant for the FBI but he started as

211
00:09:13,420 --> 00:09:15,970
a check hider when he was a teenager and

212
00:09:15,970 --> 00:09:18,130
then he progressed into printing his own

213
00:09:18,130 --> 00:09:20,620
checks and then he progressed into

214
00:09:20,620 --> 00:09:22,569
creating identities to go with the

215
00:09:22,569 --> 00:09:25,810
checks and it was very exciting he at

216
00:09:25,810 --> 00:09:27,819
one point he pretended to be a doctor a

217
00:09:27,819 --> 00:09:32,410
pilot a prison guard he ended up serving

218
00:09:32,410 --> 00:09:34,720
about five years when he was caught out

219
00:09:34,720 --> 00:09:37,000
of a 12-year sentence and they made him

220
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:39,430
work for the FBI for free identifying

221
00:09:39,430 --> 00:09:42,160
fraud to get him out of it so if you

222
00:09:42,160 --> 00:09:43,509
haven't seen the movie I highly

223
00:09:43,509 --> 00:09:45,730
recommend it or he has a lot of books

224
00:09:45,730 --> 00:09:48,040
out he still talks about fraud to this

225
00:09:48,040 --> 00:09:54,759
day great great guy so thinking like a

226
00:09:54,759 --> 00:09:57,100
fraudster you know I first wanted to

227
00:09:57,100 --> 00:09:58,899
make sure I wanted to write down we're

228
00:09:58,899 --> 00:10:00,310
focusing on check kiting

229
00:10:00,310 --> 00:10:02,410
what do we know I wanted to talk about

230
00:10:02,410 --> 00:10:04,360
everything we know about check kiting

231
00:10:04,360 --> 00:10:06,970
all the techniques we know that they

232
00:10:06,970 --> 00:10:09,689
typically use the ATM we know that they

233
00:10:09,689 --> 00:10:11,680
typically do it in two hundred dollar

234
00:10:11,680 --> 00:10:16,509
increments and we know that usually it

235
00:10:16,509 --> 00:10:20,019
is a newer account so these are all

236
00:10:20,019 --> 00:10:24,430
things that we have we saw from previous

237
00:10:24,430 --> 00:10:25,959
incidents so I wanted to start asking

238
00:10:25,959 --> 00:10:28,899
you know how would I do it like I have a

239
00:10:28,899 --> 00:10:30,399
note of knowledge about the inner

240
00:10:30,399 --> 00:10:33,279
workings of the organization and I

241
00:10:33,279 --> 00:10:34,899
wanted to start thinking how would how

242
00:10:34,899 --> 00:10:36,399
would I commit this crime and get away

243
00:10:36,399 --> 00:10:38,319
with it and then I started asking my

244
00:10:38,319 --> 00:10:40,029
co-workers you know how would you do it

245
00:10:40,029 --> 00:10:42,910
if it was you and they'd say yeah I mean

246
00:10:42,910 --> 00:10:44,800
I would do it that way but like Carol's

247
00:10:44,800 --> 00:10:46,329
not going to know to do it this way

248
00:10:46,329 --> 00:10:47,589
because she doesn't know about her inner

249
00:10:47,589 --> 00:10:50,709
workings but if you think about it what

250
00:10:50,709 --> 00:10:53,019
if someone inside the organization is

251
00:10:53,019 --> 00:10:55,540
committing this crime so I think it's

252
00:10:55,540 --> 00:10:58,240
just as important to think about how you

253
00:10:58,240 --> 00:11:00,189
would do it with your knowledge set as

254
00:11:00,189 --> 00:11:02,769
well as how would Carol do it how has

255
00:11:02,769 --> 00:11:04,990
Carol been doing it and so it's

256
00:11:04,990 --> 00:11:07,029
important to not only know what she's

257
00:11:07,029 --> 00:11:08,080
doing in the wild

258
00:11:08,080 --> 00:11:10,630
you know look at previous incidents and

259
00:11:10,630 --> 00:11:12,090
take that information under

260
00:11:12,090 --> 00:11:17,770
consideration so we started our hunt we

261
00:11:17,770 --> 00:11:19,870
had some common characteristics that we

262
00:11:19,870 --> 00:11:21,880
found from our own knowledge and from

263
00:11:21,880 --> 00:11:23,890
previous incidents in the organization

264
00:11:23,890 --> 00:11:26,950
and we found a ton of check kiting

265
00:11:26,950 --> 00:11:30,100
activities and so we had all this data

266
00:11:30,100 --> 00:11:33,150
but we have to analyze it because I

267
00:11:33,150 --> 00:11:36,340
wanted to make sure if you know I saw a

268
00:11:36,340 --> 00:11:38,320
lot of connections between Carroll and

269
00:11:38,320 --> 00:11:40,030
other people I didn't know if she's

270
00:11:40,030 --> 00:11:42,430
working with a group of people as if

271
00:11:42,430 --> 00:11:44,560
there is their lone Wolf's or is it a

272
00:11:44,560 --> 00:11:47,590
combination so I've decided to make an

273
00:11:47,590 --> 00:11:50,170
adversary profile on each individual

274
00:11:50,170 --> 00:11:52,840
person that we saw in our results from

275
00:11:52,840 --> 00:11:55,330
the hunt and what I did was I basically

276
00:11:55,330 --> 00:11:58,000
just made an Excel spreadsheet with

277
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:00,700
every single person that was involved

278
00:12:00,700 --> 00:12:02,380
all the checks that they had written all

279
00:12:02,380 --> 00:12:04,210
of the ATM activity who were they're

280
00:12:04,210 --> 00:12:06,790
writing checks to and each person that

281
00:12:06,790 --> 00:12:08,350
they wrote a check to that was a check

282
00:12:08,350 --> 00:12:10,750
hiding activity I documented everything

283
00:12:10,750 --> 00:12:13,720
and then I started doing a little bit

284
00:12:13,720 --> 00:12:16,050
analysis on the behaviors leading up to

285
00:12:16,050 --> 00:12:19,030
the event that we were able to find was

286
00:12:19,030 --> 00:12:20,920
there any red flags anything that could

287
00:12:20,920 --> 00:12:23,470
lead us to earlier detection and what I

288
00:12:23,470 --> 00:12:26,160
found out was a lot of these people were

289
00:12:26,160 --> 00:12:28,960
repeat offenders they started out with

290
00:12:28,960 --> 00:12:31,240
smaller amounts and then they increased

291
00:12:31,240 --> 00:12:33,760
their amount to through the 200 and some

292
00:12:33,760 --> 00:12:37,330
of they even got up to 500 so we looked

293
00:12:37,330 --> 00:12:39,190
at all of that but it was becoming too

294
00:12:39,190 --> 00:12:41,770
much in Excel so we decided to just

295
00:12:41,770 --> 00:12:44,230
start visualizing it with with

296
00:12:44,230 --> 00:12:46,480
connections and there's a lot of data

297
00:12:46,480 --> 00:12:48,400
visualizations tools available that I'm

298
00:12:48,400 --> 00:12:51,310
aware of now but we were you know thick

299
00:12:51,310 --> 00:12:52,510
in the hunt I didn't want to lose

300
00:12:52,510 --> 00:12:54,670
traction so we literally just took out a

301
00:12:54,670 --> 00:12:56,350
piece of paper and started writing it

302
00:12:56,350 --> 00:12:58,870
down and it looked a lot like this we

303
00:12:58,870 --> 00:13:01,480
soon realized Carroll was at the the

304
00:13:01,480 --> 00:13:02,740
middle of this she was definitely

305
00:13:02,740 --> 00:13:04,570
leading everyone and showing everyone

306
00:13:04,570 --> 00:13:06,820
how to do it I wasn't sure if she was

307
00:13:06,820 --> 00:13:08,800
taking advantage of people or if they

308
00:13:08,800 --> 00:13:10,630
were willing that wasn't something we

309
00:13:10,630 --> 00:13:14,140
were able to find out but at the end of

310
00:13:14,140 --> 00:13:16,720
it we did discover a group of about 40

311
00:13:16,720 --> 00:13:20,500
people 35 to 40 people who were a part

312
00:13:20,500 --> 00:13:21,520
of this

313
00:13:21,520 --> 00:13:23,500
robbery and we were able to give that

314
00:13:23,500 --> 00:13:25,930
information over to the authorities and

315
00:13:25,930 --> 00:13:28,150
then we found out that we weren't the

316
00:13:28,150 --> 00:13:30,490
only ones involved there were other

317
00:13:30,490 --> 00:13:32,230
financial institutions that were victims

318
00:13:32,230 --> 00:13:34,630
to the same group of people and so I

319
00:13:34,630 --> 00:13:36,880
realized you know had we had some kind

320
00:13:36,880 --> 00:13:39,820
of communication setup or you know an

321
00:13:39,820 --> 00:13:41,860
open line of communication to share

322
00:13:41,860 --> 00:13:46,030
fraud indicators or advice or these are

323
00:13:46,030 --> 00:13:48,280
the names that we're seeing you know it

324
00:13:48,280 --> 00:13:49,990
we could have saved the organization a

325
00:13:49,990 --> 00:13:52,030
lot of money or even prevented a lot of

326
00:13:52,030 --> 00:13:55,720
the fraud that happened so when I moved

327
00:13:55,720 --> 00:13:58,960
into cybersecurity I realized that a lot

328
00:13:58,960 --> 00:14:01,600
of this of the methodologies that I used

329
00:14:01,600 --> 00:14:03,700
as a fraud analyst could be applied to

330
00:14:03,700 --> 00:14:05,530
the cyber domain and specifically

331
00:14:05,530 --> 00:14:07,720
hunting adversaries because at the end

332
00:14:07,720 --> 00:14:10,480
of the day you know we're both hunting a

333
00:14:10,480 --> 00:14:13,690
person with behaviors and patterns that

334
00:14:13,690 --> 00:14:16,900
you can identify so the first thing you

335
00:14:16,900 --> 00:14:19,750
know I found was the most useful as a

336
00:14:19,750 --> 00:14:24,010
financial fraud analyst was knowing in

337
00:14:24,010 --> 00:14:26,830
my environment being aware of all the

338
00:14:26,830 --> 00:14:28,510
policies and procedures that people take

339
00:14:28,510 --> 00:14:30,340
advantage of knowing where they're gonna

340
00:14:30,340 --> 00:14:33,100
do it and in cybersecurity that means

341
00:14:33,100 --> 00:14:35,380
mapping your network knowing what your

342
00:14:35,380 --> 00:14:37,960
assets are knowing where the path that

343
00:14:37,960 --> 00:14:39,550
they're going to take what are they

344
00:14:39,550 --> 00:14:42,160
after and that goes into cultivating an

345
00:14:42,160 --> 00:14:44,620
adversarial mindset you know you want to

346
00:14:44,620 --> 00:14:47,950
be aware of how someone's gonna do it

347
00:14:47,950 --> 00:14:51,910
and in financial fraud the motive is its

348
00:14:51,910 --> 00:14:53,950
financial gain but in cybersecurity

349
00:14:53,950 --> 00:14:57,000
there could be a load of different

350
00:14:57,000 --> 00:14:59,110
motives it could you know it could be a

351
00:14:59,110 --> 00:15:01,900
hacktivist it could be someone that's

352
00:15:01,900 --> 00:15:03,490
you know looking for financial gain

353
00:15:03,490 --> 00:15:05,350
there could be a lot of different

354
00:15:05,350 --> 00:15:07,840
scenarios that happen so it's really

355
00:15:07,840 --> 00:15:11,110
important to be aware of the techniques

356
00:15:11,110 --> 00:15:13,060
and the tactics and procedures of

357
00:15:13,060 --> 00:15:15,010
adversaries in the wild remember we

358
00:15:15,010 --> 00:15:16,690
talked about I think it's just as

359
00:15:16,690 --> 00:15:19,300
important to take your knowledge of how

360
00:15:19,300 --> 00:15:21,460
you would do it and and build your

361
00:15:21,460 --> 00:15:23,880
adversary profiles that way as well and

362
00:15:23,880 --> 00:15:29,800
then the number one thing that I learned

363
00:15:29,800 --> 00:15:32,260
that really helped me and our specific

364
00:15:32,260 --> 00:15:35,260
hunting scenarios was having a process

365
00:15:35,260 --> 00:15:38,350
and documenting everything when you're

366
00:15:38,350 --> 00:15:40,660
in the hunt you're gonna think that

367
00:15:40,660 --> 00:15:42,160
you're gonna remember that guy oh

368
00:15:42,160 --> 00:15:43,750
there's that one guy who was connected

369
00:15:43,750 --> 00:15:45,490
and he did that thing but you're not

370
00:15:45,490 --> 00:15:46,870
going to remember you have to document

371
00:15:46,870 --> 00:15:48,790
everything and if you're working with

372
00:15:48,790 --> 00:15:50,530
law enforcement that really comes in

373
00:15:50,530 --> 00:15:53,670
handy to be able to provide that to them

374
00:15:53,670 --> 00:15:56,890
you know and without the processes you

375
00:15:56,890 --> 00:15:59,590
know you can't just go looking for apt

376
00:15:59,590 --> 00:16:01,150
28 and think that they're going to be

377
00:16:01,150 --> 00:16:02,650
hiding under a rock in your network

378
00:16:02,650 --> 00:16:04,240
somewhere you know you've got to have

379
00:16:04,240 --> 00:16:06,310
the right processes to be able to

380
00:16:06,310 --> 00:16:08,620
identify all all the things that are

381
00:16:08,620 --> 00:16:10,510
going on because you know a single

382
00:16:10,510 --> 00:16:13,360
indicator of compromise is just one

383
00:16:13,360 --> 00:16:15,760
tentacle of a larger campaign and

384
00:16:15,760 --> 00:16:17,890
without the processes and documentation

385
00:16:17,890 --> 00:16:20,410
- you know reign in the chaos you're not

386
00:16:20,410 --> 00:16:22,060
going to be able to find all the

387
00:16:22,060 --> 00:16:23,530
tentacles you're not gonna be able to

388
00:16:23,530 --> 00:16:25,900
find what it means who it's connected to

389
00:16:25,900 --> 00:16:29,290
so that is really important and post

390
00:16:29,290 --> 00:16:31,000
incident activities what I mean by that

391
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:34,900
is the after a security incident happens

392
00:16:34,900 --> 00:16:38,500
you know start analyzing the behaviors

393
00:16:38,500 --> 00:16:40,750
if you can find them that led up to the

394
00:16:40,750 --> 00:16:42,730
point of detection look for red flags

395
00:16:42,730 --> 00:16:44,560
anything that could have led to earlier

396
00:16:44,560 --> 00:16:46,600
detection and then also you know

397
00:16:46,600 --> 00:16:48,340
document those lessons that you learned

398
00:16:48,340 --> 00:16:51,400
the document the techniques that you're

399
00:16:51,400 --> 00:16:53,410
seeing in your environment because that

400
00:16:53,410 --> 00:16:55,920
information is extremely important and

401
00:16:55,920 --> 00:16:59,620
then start small you know start hunting

402
00:16:59,620 --> 00:17:01,360
with adversarial or with known

403
00:17:01,360 --> 00:17:03,820
indicators of compromise you don't you

404
00:17:03,820 --> 00:17:05,290
know you don't want to go looking

405
00:17:05,290 --> 00:17:06,609
willy-nilly because you're going to go

406
00:17:06,609 --> 00:17:08,619
down a rabbit hole you know you want to

407
00:17:08,619 --> 00:17:12,130
stay focused and automation is just an

408
00:17:12,130 --> 00:17:15,069
aid you know there is no substitute for

409
00:17:15,069 --> 00:17:17,199
human driven analysis and that's

410
00:17:17,199 --> 00:17:18,520
something that I've learned as a fraud

411
00:17:18,520 --> 00:17:20,349
analyst and as well as a cyber security

412
00:17:20,349 --> 00:17:24,099
analyst you know automation has its good

413
00:17:24,099 --> 00:17:26,709
parts but you know when when you're

414
00:17:26,709 --> 00:17:28,420
thick in the hunt and you know a

415
00:17:28,420 --> 00:17:29,920
computer's not going to see those gray

416
00:17:29,920 --> 00:17:32,530
areas and see that lateral thinking that

417
00:17:32,530 --> 00:17:35,470
my team is able to make and then the

418
00:17:35,470 --> 00:17:37,570
visualization really helps me be able to

419
00:17:37,570 --> 00:17:40,000
you know see that I see the connections

420
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:42,180
and make correlations between events and

421
00:17:42,180 --> 00:17:46,300
indicators of compromise and then like I

422
00:17:46,300 --> 00:17:48,640
said if we would have had that open line

423
00:17:48,640 --> 00:17:49,440
of communication

424
00:17:49,440 --> 00:17:52,929
with other financial institutions we

425
00:17:52,929 --> 00:17:55,510
would have been able to either prevent

426
00:17:55,510 --> 00:17:58,750
the fraud from happening or just detect

427
00:17:58,750 --> 00:18:01,030
it earlier which saves the organization

428
00:18:01,030 --> 00:18:02,620
you know hundreds of thousands of

429
00:18:02,620 --> 00:18:07,000
dollars so I think all of that can can

430
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:08,920
definitely be applied to the cyber

431
00:18:08,920 --> 00:18:10,510
domain and you can have a successful

432
00:18:10,510 --> 00:18:14,350
hunt so I know this is a lot to look at

433
00:18:14,350 --> 00:18:16,510
but I wanted to inspire anyone that's

434
00:18:16,510 --> 00:18:19,090
currently in threat hunting or anyone

435
00:18:19,090 --> 00:18:20,500
that's thinking about making any of this

436
00:18:20,500 --> 00:18:22,450
actionable so I'm going to make these

437
00:18:22,450 --> 00:18:25,900
slides available for download after so

438
00:18:25,900 --> 00:18:29,470
you can go ahead and see that later so

439
00:18:29,470 --> 00:18:31,360
you don't have to jot it all down now so

440
00:18:31,360 --> 00:18:34,480
in conclusion you know I wanted to shine

441
00:18:34,480 --> 00:18:36,190
light with this presentation on how

442
00:18:36,190 --> 00:18:39,460
similar the two fields are you know with

443
00:18:39,460 --> 00:18:43,530
with fraud detection and cyber security

444
00:18:43,530 --> 00:18:45,880
you know the two fields can really learn

445
00:18:45,880 --> 00:18:47,320
from each other because at the end of

446
00:18:47,320 --> 00:18:49,090
the day you know you're both hunting

447
00:18:49,090 --> 00:18:51,730
people and they both they all they both

448
00:18:51,730 --> 00:18:55,179
have patterns and behaviors that you can

449
00:18:55,179 --> 00:19:00,040
identify and I really hope that it can

450
00:19:00,040 --> 00:19:02,350
inspire other people to get into threat

451
00:19:02,350 --> 00:19:04,210
hunting it doesn't have to be super

452
00:19:04,210 --> 00:19:06,730
complicated you'd be surprised how much

453
00:19:06,730 --> 00:19:08,230
you already know about your environment

454
00:19:08,230 --> 00:19:10,720
and how that information can really tie

455
00:19:10,720 --> 00:19:14,620
into your hunts so don't take that

456
00:19:14,620 --> 00:19:17,530
information for granted and you know

457
00:19:17,530 --> 00:19:19,840
don't forget that you know you don't

458
00:19:19,840 --> 00:19:23,260
just want to look at what is happening

459
00:19:23,260 --> 00:19:25,690
in your environment and what's happening

460
00:19:25,690 --> 00:19:27,040
in the world you also want to take your

461
00:19:27,040 --> 00:19:28,660
own knowledge into consideration because

462
00:19:28,660 --> 00:19:30,970
you might be able to identify an insider

463
00:19:30,970 --> 00:19:33,940
threat with that information so it's

464
00:19:33,940 --> 00:19:35,410
important to document all that

465
00:19:35,410 --> 00:19:38,919
information so I hope you like my

466
00:19:38,919 --> 00:19:42,040
presentation and thank you so much for

467
00:19:42,040 --> 00:19:48,490
watching thank you very much Nicole for

468
00:19:48,490 --> 00:19:51,370
this wonderful one so let me see if we

469
00:19:51,370 --> 00:19:57,640
have any question going on so what do

470
00:19:57,640 --> 00:20:00,070
you have any anecdote or any anything so

471
00:20:00,070 --> 00:20:02,010
how did you decide to move

472
00:20:02,010 --> 00:20:04,950
of a sudden from you know a traditional

473
00:20:04,950 --> 00:20:07,710
financial fraud to the security field

474
00:20:07,710 --> 00:20:11,850
what was the the real driver sure so I

475
00:20:11,850 --> 00:20:14,550
was actually already in my degree I had

476
00:20:14,550 --> 00:20:19,230
already picked information security so

477
00:20:19,230 --> 00:20:21,570
when I I was already working in the

478
00:20:21,570 --> 00:20:23,850
financial institution and then there was

479
00:20:23,850 --> 00:20:25,770
a position that opened up as a Friday

480
00:20:25,770 --> 00:20:28,530
analyst and I thought you know it kind

481
00:20:28,530 --> 00:20:30,330
of hopefully would give me ready for

482
00:20:30,330 --> 00:20:31,980
cyber security because they're both you

483
00:20:31,980 --> 00:20:34,230
know hunting adversaries and and I just

484
00:20:34,230 --> 00:20:35,850
thought it would be really fun to try to

485
00:20:35,850 --> 00:20:38,160
identify a different fraud because I saw

486
00:20:38,160 --> 00:20:40,560
it in the position that I was already in

487
00:20:40,560 --> 00:20:43,410
with the organization I've been in that

488
00:20:43,410 --> 00:20:45,360
position so I know I know what you mean

489
00:20:45,360 --> 00:20:47,700
for being is really close and I've been

490
00:20:47,700 --> 00:20:49,440
working with investigators on both sides

491
00:20:49,440 --> 00:20:53,160
so it's kind of similar field and really

492
00:20:53,160 --> 00:20:56,040
different field aside but the technique

493
00:20:56,040 --> 00:21:01,590
a kind of Samia and but it excites you

494
00:21:01,590 --> 00:21:04,200
and won't open the other what did you

495
00:21:04,200 --> 00:21:06,450
like and what didn't you like in one

496
00:21:06,450 --> 00:21:07,860
side of the fence of the other side of

497
00:21:07,860 --> 00:21:08,750
the fence

498
00:21:08,750 --> 00:21:12,090
well what one specific thing is I

499
00:21:12,090 --> 00:21:14,730
noticed in cyber security it's a lot

500
00:21:14,730 --> 00:21:18,180
easier to shut things down you know when

501
00:21:18,180 --> 00:21:19,860
it's someone's bank account you can't

502
00:21:19,860 --> 00:21:23,400
just well let's just shut it down you

503
00:21:23,400 --> 00:21:25,560
could be wrong and then they don't pay

504
00:21:25,560 --> 00:21:27,950
their mortgage and then you get fired so

505
00:21:27,950 --> 00:21:30,210
that's one of the and then you know

506
00:21:30,210 --> 00:21:32,100
people use like you know the expedited

507
00:21:32,100 --> 00:21:34,050
funds availability Act that's that's not

508
00:21:34,050 --> 00:21:35,550
something we have the power to change

509
00:21:35,550 --> 00:21:37,500
you know and certain things in cyber

510
00:21:37,500 --> 00:21:39,120
security you can't change but you know

511
00:21:39,120 --> 00:21:41,220
ultimately you know there's a lot of

512
00:21:41,220 --> 00:21:42,510
things you can there's a lot of rule

513
00:21:42,510 --> 00:21:44,130
sets that you can put in place and

514
00:21:44,130 --> 00:21:47,340
there's a lot more flexibility and

515
00:21:47,340 --> 00:21:50,400
anything you will take from one one area

516
00:21:50,400 --> 00:21:52,580
to the other and the other way around

517
00:21:52,580 --> 00:21:57,060
so from traditional fraud investigation

518
00:21:57,060 --> 00:21:59,250
to cyber security in term of regulation

519
00:21:59,250 --> 00:22:00,420
or the other way around

520
00:22:00,420 --> 00:22:04,620
oh I I actually think both fields can

521
00:22:04,620 --> 00:22:05,910
really learn from each other and I think

522
00:22:05,910 --> 00:22:08,960
they should learn from each other more I

523
00:22:08,960 --> 00:22:11,430
haven't been in the fraud industry in a

524
00:22:11,430 --> 00:22:12,750
little while so I don't know how far

525
00:22:12,750 --> 00:22:14,490
they've come but I know there's a lot

526
00:22:14,490 --> 00:22:15,630
more fancy tools and

527
00:22:15,630 --> 00:22:19,620
I had access to and that's one of the

528
00:22:19,620 --> 00:22:23,040
the reason that we earned the fact that

529
00:22:23,040 --> 00:22:25,680
I didn't have a lot of resources I'm

530
00:22:25,680 --> 00:22:27,480
actually grateful for because I actually

531
00:22:27,480 --> 00:22:30,840
have a lot more analysis and now I'm a

532
00:22:30,840 --> 00:22:33,900
huge analytics nerd I understand you

533
00:22:33,900 --> 00:22:36,420
know life without automation and fancy

534
00:22:36,420 --> 00:22:38,130
tools and you know getting down in the

535
00:22:38,130 --> 00:22:39,720
weeds and just you know doing it myself

536
00:22:39,720 --> 00:22:43,820
and that's something I'm grateful for

537
00:22:43,820 --> 00:22:45,870
know that that's amazing

538
00:22:45,870 --> 00:22:48,660
so we have we have the next period

539
00:22:48,660 --> 00:22:51,630
coming up in a few minutes but any any

540
00:22:51,630 --> 00:22:53,280
kind of advice you want to give to

541
00:22:53,280 --> 00:22:55,710
people I mean like you that they came

542
00:22:55,710 --> 00:22:57,870
from one field and decided all of a

543
00:22:57,870 --> 00:22:59,310
sudden to say oh there is an opportunity

544
00:22:59,310 --> 00:23:01,920
in security like a developer it is kind

545
00:23:01,920 --> 00:23:04,560
of the traditional path but other people

546
00:23:04,560 --> 00:23:09,360
might might be whom I find not as easy

547
00:23:09,360 --> 00:23:11,580
to France to transition to security

548
00:23:11,580 --> 00:23:15,170
field so any last I need a suggestion

549
00:23:15,170 --> 00:23:17,280
well the great thing about cybersecurity

550
00:23:17,280 --> 00:23:21,210
and all the all its sectors is a lot of

551
00:23:21,210 --> 00:23:23,220
the information is readily available and

552
00:23:23,220 --> 00:23:25,890
open to the public so if you have the

553
00:23:25,890 --> 00:23:28,680
drive to learn you know most of it is

554
00:23:28,680 --> 00:23:31,260
freely available and I've found that the

555
00:23:31,260 --> 00:23:36,990
community is extremely inviting and most

556
00:23:36,990 --> 00:23:40,230
of you know my learning has been from

557
00:23:40,230 --> 00:23:42,390
mentors in the field and just you know

558
00:23:42,390 --> 00:23:45,210
it's just my own personal drive to learn

559
00:23:45,210 --> 00:23:47,820
and get my hands dirty with different

560
00:23:47,820 --> 00:23:50,310
tools and it's great how many

561
00:23:50,310 --> 00:23:52,950
open-source tools are available for the

562
00:23:52,950 --> 00:23:59,040
community to learn and and grow thank

563
00:23:59,040 --> 00:24:02,240
you very much for sharing and can I

564
00:24:02,240 --> 00:24:06,570
