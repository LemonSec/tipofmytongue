1
00:00:00,080 --> 00:00:03,040
i'm so happy to have the board

2
00:00:03,040 --> 00:00:05,440
how you doing gee i did great jeff it's

3
00:00:05,440 --> 00:00:07,040
uh we've never actually met before but

4
00:00:07,040 --> 00:00:09,599
i've seen all your talks i loved uh your

5
00:00:09,599 --> 00:00:11,200
devops day's chicago talk and i'm

6
00:00:11,200 --> 00:00:12,799
delighted that uh we're doing this

7
00:00:12,799 --> 00:00:13,519
together

8
00:00:13,519 --> 00:00:15,280
yeah yeah it's great it's funny my i

9
00:00:15,280 --> 00:00:16,560
have a book club and we just finished

10
00:00:16,560 --> 00:00:18,960
the unicorn project

11
00:00:18,960 --> 00:00:21,680
well it's uh it's that timing um so you

12
00:00:21,680 --> 00:00:23,039
know we're just gonna roll right into it

13
00:00:23,039 --> 00:00:24,480
because i imagine we're gonna get a

14
00:00:24,480 --> 00:00:27,039
a ton of questions i'm gonna selfishly

15
00:00:27,039 --> 00:00:28,480
take the first question

16
00:00:28,480 --> 00:00:31,760
uh so i'm always curious when people

17
00:00:31,760 --> 00:00:33,040
make the move from like

18
00:00:33,040 --> 00:00:35,840
engineering to to more of a management

19
00:00:35,840 --> 00:00:36,320
you know

20
00:00:36,320 --> 00:00:38,559
um organizational perspective so just

21
00:00:38,559 --> 00:00:40,160
curious what piqued your interest about

22
00:00:40,160 --> 00:00:41,760
organizational performance after years

23
00:00:41,760 --> 00:00:43,920
of being technical at tripwire and

24
00:00:43,920 --> 00:00:45,840
being in the nitty-gritty there yeah you

25
00:00:45,840 --> 00:00:47,039
know that's interesting i mean i

26
00:00:47,039 --> 00:00:49,120
for uh yes i was the technical founder

27
00:00:49,120 --> 00:00:50,239
of a company called tripwire in the

28
00:00:50,239 --> 00:00:51,680
information security space and that was

29
00:00:51,680 --> 00:00:53,199
in 1997.

30
00:00:53,199 --> 00:00:56,640
uh but what uh a journey i stumbled into

31
00:00:56,640 --> 00:00:59,920
was in 1999 when i got to

32
00:00:59,920 --> 00:01:02,000
study what we call now the high

33
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:03,840
performing technology organizations that

34
00:01:03,840 --> 00:01:04,959
had the best

35
00:01:04,959 --> 00:01:06,080
due date performance and development

36
00:01:06,080 --> 00:01:07,439
they had the best operational stability

37
00:01:07,439 --> 00:01:08,560
and the best possible security

38
00:01:08,560 --> 00:01:09,680
compliance

39
00:01:09,680 --> 00:01:12,240
and so yeah they had great technical

40
00:01:12,240 --> 00:01:14,240
acumen and technical excellence

41
00:01:14,240 --> 00:01:15,920
uh but they're also you know without

42
00:01:15,920 --> 00:01:17,280
question they had you know something was

43
00:01:17,280 --> 00:01:18,159
different about the way those

44
00:01:18,159 --> 00:01:19,360
organizations were led

45
00:01:19,360 --> 00:01:20,799
and so it was really that quest

46
00:01:20,799 --> 00:01:22,080
understand what were those organizations

47
00:01:22,080 --> 00:01:23,280
doing differently

48
00:01:23,280 --> 00:01:24,880
uh that really set them apart from

49
00:01:24,880 --> 00:01:26,880
everybody else and so

50
00:01:26,880 --> 00:01:29,119
yeah and uh yeah i would be remiss if i

51
00:01:29,119 --> 00:01:30,799
didn't uh

52
00:01:30,799 --> 00:01:32,560
mention a book that really changed my

53
00:01:32,560 --> 00:01:35,040
life called the goal uh by dr elijah

54
00:01:35,040 --> 00:01:35,840
goldratt

55
00:01:35,840 --> 00:01:38,079
and that was a book uh there was a novel

56
00:01:38,079 --> 00:01:39,840
about a plant manager who had to fix his

57
00:01:39,840 --> 00:01:41,360
cost and due date issues in 90 days

58
00:01:41,360 --> 00:01:42,960
otherwise they shut the plant down

59
00:01:42,960 --> 00:01:46,000
and you know uh you know

60
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:48,560
my co-workers i studied that book for

61
00:01:48,560 --> 00:01:49,840
over a decade getting ready to write the

62
00:01:49,840 --> 00:01:50,960
phoenix project and uh

63
00:01:50,960 --> 00:01:52,640
so much of my fascination about

64
00:01:52,640 --> 00:01:54,159
leadership styles and problem solving

65
00:01:54,159 --> 00:01:55,680
behaviors and the cultural norms they

66
00:01:55,680 --> 00:01:57,200
set and the behaviors they model

67
00:01:57,200 --> 00:01:59,600
really came from pouring through that

68
00:01:59,600 --> 00:02:01,040
book really well you know we're

69
00:02:01,040 --> 00:02:03,119
trying to tease apart almost every scene

70
00:02:03,119 --> 00:02:04,079
about you know

71
00:02:04,079 --> 00:02:05,840
what enabled them to do such great

72
00:02:05,840 --> 00:02:07,439
things and solve problems and

73
00:02:07,439 --> 00:02:09,199
uh spread greatness uh within

74
00:02:09,199 --> 00:02:10,959
organizations so uh

75
00:02:10,959 --> 00:02:13,360
uh yeah it almost goes back uh 20 years

76
00:02:13,360 --> 00:02:14,080
wow yeah

77
00:02:14,080 --> 00:02:15,599
and you know you talk about this a

78
00:02:15,599 --> 00:02:16,720
little bit too but you know you can

79
00:02:16,720 --> 00:02:18,080
definitely see the influence from the

80
00:02:18,080 --> 00:02:18,640
goal

81
00:02:18,640 --> 00:02:19,760
in the phoenix project and i think

82
00:02:19,760 --> 00:02:21,120
that's what makes it so approachable

83
00:02:21,120 --> 00:02:22,160
right is because

84
00:02:22,160 --> 00:02:23,680
you know we're taking these these

85
00:02:23,680 --> 00:02:25,280
concepts and we're laying them out in

86
00:02:25,280 --> 00:02:26,319
this sort of uh

87
00:02:26,319 --> 00:02:28,800
story-like format that makes it really

88
00:02:28,800 --> 00:02:30,000
uh relatable

89
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:32,720
and you know just a uh run-of-the-mill

90
00:02:32,720 --> 00:02:33,680
business book probably

91
00:02:33,680 --> 00:02:35,120
yeah what's really uh what's interesting

92
00:02:35,120 --> 00:02:36,720
to me is that the the

93
00:02:36,720 --> 00:02:38,560
uh phoenix projects were written really

94
00:02:38,560 --> 00:02:40,480
from the perspective of ops leadership

95
00:02:40,480 --> 00:02:42,400
and i know from your background right

96
00:02:42,400 --> 00:02:44,319
like me right that's where

97
00:02:44,319 --> 00:02:46,080
uh that's always what i gravitated

98
00:02:46,080 --> 00:02:47,760
towards right uh ops because it was my

99
00:02:47,760 --> 00:02:49,200
observation that ops is where the saves

100
00:02:49,200 --> 00:02:50,080
were made

101
00:02:50,080 --> 00:02:51,920
it was ops that saved us from you know

102
00:02:51,920 --> 00:02:53,760
sloppy developers from flowing up

103
00:02:53,760 --> 00:02:54,800
everything in production

104
00:02:54,800 --> 00:02:56,400
it was actually ops that actually

105
00:02:56,400 --> 00:02:58,480
allowed us to protect applications and

106
00:02:58,480 --> 00:02:59,360
our data

107
00:02:59,360 --> 00:03:01,440
because of sloppy security people right

108
00:03:01,440 --> 00:03:02,640
um and

109
00:03:02,640 --> 00:03:05,040
so uh uh in some ways you know the

110
00:03:05,040 --> 00:03:06,800
protagonist in that book was

111
00:03:06,800 --> 00:03:09,519
uh the vp of operations um in the

112
00:03:09,519 --> 00:03:10,400
phoenix project and

113
00:03:10,400 --> 00:03:11,760
you know for me uh to go back to your

114
00:03:11,760 --> 00:03:13,360
question uh it was actually really

115
00:03:13,360 --> 00:03:14,560
interesting to sort of tell the

116
00:03:14,560 --> 00:03:16,560
phoenix project from a developer's

117
00:03:16,560 --> 00:03:18,720
perspective so maxine is a leader

118
00:03:18,720 --> 00:03:20,319
but uh i think a leader of a different

119
00:03:20,319 --> 00:03:22,000
sort right she's not that the

120
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:24,080
uh the top of the org chart uh but but

121
00:03:24,080 --> 00:03:25,360
without a doubt right she is one of the

122
00:03:25,360 --> 00:03:26,879
leaders of the rebellion bringing

123
00:03:26,879 --> 00:03:28,959
great technical practices and excellence

124
00:03:28,959 --> 00:03:30,480
back into the organization

125
00:03:30,480 --> 00:03:32,720
uh so i love the notion that leaders

126
00:03:32,720 --> 00:03:34,959
come in all shape size forms and

127
00:03:34,959 --> 00:03:36,480
it's not just the person with the

128
00:03:36,480 --> 00:03:38,400
fanciest title it really is uh

129
00:03:38,400 --> 00:03:39,840
you know comes from everywhere and

130
00:03:39,840 --> 00:03:40,959
that's what's really great about it too

131
00:03:40,959 --> 00:03:42,239
because there's so many people that i

132
00:03:42,239 --> 00:03:43,680
run into that are reading it that are in

133
00:03:43,680 --> 00:03:44,879
leadership but they're not at that

134
00:03:44,879 --> 00:03:46,879
senior level yet so it's good to

135
00:03:46,879 --> 00:03:48,480
you know sort of highlight that you know

136
00:03:48,480 --> 00:03:50,000
we can still make an impact

137
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:51,599
at different levels of the organization

138
00:03:51,599 --> 00:03:53,200
it doesn't have to come directly from

139
00:03:53,200 --> 00:03:54,000
the top

140
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:55,760
in fact i mean i think what maxine the

141
00:03:55,760 --> 00:03:57,280
protagonist in unicorn project shows

142
00:03:57,280 --> 00:03:58,400
that you know there's some things that

143
00:03:58,400 --> 00:04:00,000
cannot come to the top they're too far

144
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:02,239
away from the work right and it's only

145
00:04:02,239 --> 00:04:03,519
you know the people at the very

146
00:04:03,519 --> 00:04:06,000
pointy end of the stick that can uh say

147
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:06,720
hey look

148
00:04:06,720 --> 00:04:09,439
nobody nobody can get anything done

149
00:04:09,439 --> 00:04:10,319
right then

150
00:04:10,319 --> 00:04:12,480
you know we need those people with their

151
00:04:12,480 --> 00:04:13,680
positional power the authority their

152
00:04:13,680 --> 00:04:14,480
relationships

153
00:04:14,480 --> 00:04:15,760
right here you know you need to enable

154
00:04:15,760 --> 00:04:17,918
us to get our work done uh so i really

155
00:04:17,918 --> 00:04:19,839
love that duality that uh

156
00:04:19,839 --> 00:04:22,639
uh you know uh it's not power just at

157
00:04:22,639 --> 00:04:24,240
the top of your chart it really does

158
00:04:24,240 --> 00:04:25,280
take uh

159
00:04:25,280 --> 00:04:27,120
everybody especially in the teams where

160
00:04:27,120 --> 00:04:28,880
the work is performed when the mission

161
00:04:28,880 --> 00:04:30,800
is owned at the teams right uh you know

162
00:04:30,800 --> 00:04:34,160
that uh leadership has to be there too

163
00:04:34,160 --> 00:04:36,479
oh all right sweet so we're gonna move

164
00:04:36,479 --> 00:04:38,000
into uh some questions now

165
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:39,759
i apologize i was able to get some early

166
00:04:39,759 --> 00:04:41,120
questions and type them up and have this

167
00:04:41,120 --> 00:04:43,840
nice cool banner and that's wow

168
00:04:43,840 --> 00:04:47,199
fall off real fast they come flowing but

169
00:04:47,199 --> 00:04:48,479
uh i really love this question the

170
00:04:48,479 --> 00:04:50,160
advent community pushes in person over

171
00:04:50,160 --> 00:04:51,840
remote interactions do you see that

172
00:04:51,840 --> 00:04:54,000
changing when things go back to normal

173
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:55,280
you know because we've obviously had to

174
00:04:55,280 --> 00:04:56,720
make a lot of changes in our working

175
00:04:56,720 --> 00:04:57,840
style amidst the

176
00:04:57,840 --> 00:05:01,280
kovic 19 pandemic hmm that's interesting

177
00:05:01,280 --> 00:05:02,560
yeah in fact um

178
00:05:02,560 --> 00:05:04,960
i don't know um i'll tell you this seems

179
00:05:04,960 --> 00:05:06,560
like a bit of a non-sequitur but

180
00:05:06,560 --> 00:05:07,759
here's something that i was actually

181
00:05:07,759 --> 00:05:09,759
talking about john allspa uh two weeks

182
00:05:09,759 --> 00:05:10,000
ago

183
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:12,080
a week ago and i was i was telling him i

184
00:05:12,080 --> 00:05:13,440
remember this workshop that he

185
00:05:13,440 --> 00:05:16,880
uh gave in 2014 at the velocity london

186
00:05:16,880 --> 00:05:17,520
conference

187
00:05:17,520 --> 00:05:19,440
and uh it was just a simple improv

188
00:05:19,440 --> 00:05:21,120
exercise so imagine you're in the front

189
00:05:21,120 --> 00:05:22,639
of a room he takes the first row and i'm

190
00:05:22,639 --> 00:05:23,759
sitting in the first row and they said

191
00:05:23,759 --> 00:05:24,400
all right

192
00:05:24,400 --> 00:05:26,320
first exercise everyone is uh you know i

193
00:05:26,320 --> 00:05:27,600
can go uh

194
00:05:27,600 --> 00:05:28,960
you know through the front row and all

195
00:05:28,960 --> 00:05:30,639
you have to do is say a word and the

196
00:05:30,639 --> 00:05:32,479
only goal is to make a grammatically

197
00:05:32,479 --> 00:05:34,000
complete sentence that's correct

198
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:36,320
right and uh you know he timed it right

199
00:05:36,320 --> 00:05:37,120
it was like you know

200
00:05:37,120 --> 00:05:38,400
six seconds right to get through eight

201
00:05:38,400 --> 00:05:40,479
people uh and then he said all right

202
00:05:40,479 --> 00:05:42,000
repeat the exercise but you're now doing

203
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:43,039
it through irc

204
00:05:43,039 --> 00:05:47,280
right and uh um you know i'll just uh

205
00:05:47,280 --> 00:05:49,120
uh i won't dwell too much on how long it

206
00:05:49,120 --> 00:05:51,120
took me to get an irc account set up

207
00:05:51,120 --> 00:05:53,520
again but uh yeah once we're all in irc

208
00:05:53,520 --> 00:05:56,479
um uh it was amazing right it took 18

209
00:05:56,479 --> 00:05:57,360
seconds

210
00:05:57,360 --> 00:05:59,680
uh and the sentence wasn't even correct

211
00:05:59,680 --> 00:06:01,280
right you you stitch all the words

212
00:06:01,280 --> 00:06:02,400
together and it didn't make

213
00:06:02,400 --> 00:06:04,479
sense um so you know i think there's a

214
00:06:04,479 --> 00:06:05,759
lot of basis to say that

215
00:06:05,759 --> 00:06:09,360
when we are uh physically uh approximate

216
00:06:09,360 --> 00:06:10,000
to someone

217
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:11,520
right uh you know there is better

218
00:06:11,520 --> 00:06:13,199
communication but um

219
00:06:13,199 --> 00:06:16,080
you know i would say that is um you know

220
00:06:16,080 --> 00:06:17,600
a lot of great relationships

221
00:06:17,600 --> 00:06:20,639
uh in fact my relationship with so many

222
00:06:20,639 --> 00:06:21,840
people in the devops community are

223
00:06:21,840 --> 00:06:23,199
primarily remote uh they've been

224
00:06:23,199 --> 00:06:24,880
primarily through video calls so

225
00:06:24,880 --> 00:06:26,800
you know i think um i would i would even

226
00:06:26,800 --> 00:06:28,639
challenge a notion of uh you know how

227
00:06:28,639 --> 00:06:30,000
important it is to be

228
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:32,720
uh face to face um you know

229
00:06:32,720 --> 00:06:34,080
acknowledging all the research that's

230
00:06:34,080 --> 00:06:35,360
been done that says

231
00:06:35,360 --> 00:06:38,960
you know uh uh the uh face-to-face is

232
00:06:38,960 --> 00:06:40,240
better than a video call which is better

233
00:06:40,240 --> 00:06:40,880
than the irc

234
00:06:40,880 --> 00:06:42,240
chat which is better than a text message

235
00:06:42,240 --> 00:06:44,880
and so forth um i think the real lesson

236
00:06:44,880 --> 00:06:45,440
to learn

237
00:06:45,440 --> 00:06:47,120
when things go back to normal is i think

238
00:06:47,120 --> 00:06:49,039
we're seeing in every organization

239
00:06:49,039 --> 00:06:51,680
uh people breaking rules to get things

240
00:06:51,680 --> 00:06:53,759
done for survival or to do what's right

241
00:06:53,759 --> 00:06:54,319
you know these

242
00:06:54,319 --> 00:06:56,639
organizational imperatives and you know

243
00:06:56,639 --> 00:06:57,759
uh suddenly

244
00:06:57,759 --> 00:06:59,680
you know security reviews and you know

245
00:06:59,680 --> 00:07:01,840
uh the organizational policies right

246
00:07:01,840 --> 00:07:02,319
yeah

247
00:07:02,319 --> 00:07:03,680
sort of went out the window right when

248
00:07:03,680 --> 00:07:06,240
survival was at stake right

249
00:07:06,240 --> 00:07:08,000
i'm hoping that same sort of courage and

250
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:09,599
bravery uh

251
00:07:09,599 --> 00:07:11,919
you know is preserved uh to show you

252
00:07:11,919 --> 00:07:12,960
know when it really matters

253
00:07:12,960 --> 00:07:15,360
you know we can do what it takes and uh

254
00:07:15,360 --> 00:07:16,960
you know rules written 20 years ago

255
00:07:16,960 --> 00:07:20,080
won't stop us right right um all right

256
00:07:20,080 --> 00:07:20,960
the next question

257
00:07:20,960 --> 00:07:22,479
uh highlights a point that i should have

258
00:07:22,479 --> 00:07:24,560
brought up this i this has been

259
00:07:24,560 --> 00:07:26,800
posed as an ama with gene but i guess

260
00:07:26,800 --> 00:07:28,840
you can ask me anything as well

261
00:07:28,840 --> 00:07:31,919
yes so uh for those that don't know my

262
00:07:31,919 --> 00:07:34,240
jams are uh dungeons and dragons

263
00:07:34,240 --> 00:07:36,800
devops comic books and video games over

264
00:07:36,800 --> 00:07:37,599
40.

265
00:07:37,599 --> 00:07:40,639
um so the question came in which robin

266
00:07:40,639 --> 00:07:42,160
was the best

267
00:07:42,160 --> 00:07:45,919
as in batman and robin now for me

268
00:07:45,919 --> 00:07:47,840
right i've got to go with dick grayson

269
00:07:47,840 --> 00:07:49,440
the original robin oh my

270
00:07:49,440 --> 00:07:50,960
mainly just because he has the most

271
00:07:50,960 --> 00:07:53,440
interesting arc right he becomes a man

272
00:07:53,440 --> 00:07:55,520
he realizes that the relationship he had

273
00:07:55,520 --> 00:07:58,879
with bruce wayne was a little abusive

274
00:07:58,879 --> 00:08:00,800
mental way right so he says you know

275
00:08:00,800 --> 00:08:02,400
what i'm gonna step out and do my own

276
00:08:02,400 --> 00:08:03,039
thing so

277
00:08:03,039 --> 00:08:06,400
for me it's it's definitely uh degrayson

278
00:08:06,400 --> 00:08:08,879
in fact can you critique uh my answer

279
00:08:08,879 --> 00:08:10,800
because i don't actually have uh

280
00:08:10,800 --> 00:08:12,720
i'm not convinced that i have the corpus

281
00:08:12,720 --> 00:08:14,080
of knowledge to actually just you know

282
00:08:14,080 --> 00:08:16,080
defend this claim but uh from all the

283
00:08:16,080 --> 00:08:17,360
ones i've seen i think i like the one on

284
00:08:17,360 --> 00:08:19,120
teen titans the best because robin is a

285
00:08:19,120 --> 00:08:20,240
leader

286
00:08:20,240 --> 00:08:23,759
and uh is uh you know clearly um

287
00:08:23,759 --> 00:08:24,879
doing the things that we want leaders to

288
00:08:24,879 --> 00:08:27,199
do right keeping the gang together

289
00:08:27,199 --> 00:08:29,919
considering cultural norms establishing

290
00:08:29,919 --> 00:08:30,240
uh

291
00:08:30,240 --> 00:08:31,919
displaying behaviors that he wants to be

292
00:08:31,919 --> 00:08:33,679
exhibited by the rest of the group

293
00:08:33,679 --> 00:08:35,839
um i i hope i'm uh i haven't totally

294
00:08:35,839 --> 00:08:36,719
misinterpreted

295
00:08:36,719 --> 00:08:38,479
uh i think you're on there i think

296
00:08:38,479 --> 00:08:40,000
you're out and uh

297
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:41,590
matt stratton agrees with you as well

298
00:08:41,590 --> 00:08:43,599
[Laughter]

299
00:08:43,599 --> 00:08:45,040
where where are you seeing the chats

300
00:08:45,040 --> 00:08:47,120
from matt stratton we are in track

301
00:08:47,120 --> 00:08:49,760
devsecops uh in the slack channels ah

302
00:08:49,760 --> 00:08:50,560
right on

303
00:08:50,560 --> 00:08:55,200
hello all right awesome uh question for

304
00:08:55,200 --> 00:08:56,320
jean how do you stop

305
00:08:56,320 --> 00:08:58,080
guild from turning into design by

306
00:08:58,080 --> 00:08:59,440
committee boards which do

307
00:08:59,440 --> 00:09:02,640
nothing oh

308
00:09:02,640 --> 00:09:05,680
ah that is interesting i i don't know

309
00:09:05,680 --> 00:09:08,880
uh but i'll tell you what i do

310
00:09:08,880 --> 00:09:11,519
know um or or what i i have some

311
00:09:11,519 --> 00:09:13,120
opinions i do hold

312
00:09:13,120 --> 00:09:14,959
so i i've been studying over and over

313
00:09:14,959 --> 00:09:16,320
this book called team of teams by

314
00:09:16,320 --> 00:09:18,320
general stanley crystal

315
00:09:18,320 --> 00:09:20,399
and uh with my mentor dr steven speer

316
00:09:20,399 --> 00:09:22,720
who wrote the high velocity edge he

317
00:09:22,720 --> 00:09:25,440
wrote the most widely downloaded paper

318
00:09:25,440 --> 00:09:26,000
from

319
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:27,040
that came out of the harvard business

320
00:09:27,040 --> 00:09:29,120
review he studied the toyota production

321
00:09:29,120 --> 00:09:30,000
process

322
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:31,360
he worked on the assembly line of a

323
00:09:31,360 --> 00:09:33,360
toyota tier 1 supplier for six months as

324
00:09:33,360 --> 00:09:34,000
part of his

325
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:37,120
doctoral dissertation right so that's uh

326
00:09:37,120 --> 00:09:38,320
it's just phenomenal to see the world

327
00:09:38,320 --> 00:09:40,800
through his eyes and um

328
00:09:40,800 --> 00:09:44,160
uh here uh sorry for this kind of

329
00:09:44,160 --> 00:09:45,040
digression but i'll

330
00:09:45,040 --> 00:09:46,800
get back to guild so the story of team

331
00:09:46,800 --> 00:09:48,000
of teams is interesting right because

332
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:49,519
it's about the joint uh special task

333
00:09:49,519 --> 00:09:50,399
forces in iraq

334
00:09:50,399 --> 00:09:52,320
uh it's you know the army rangers and

335
00:09:52,320 --> 00:09:54,320
navy seals uh delta force right so

336
00:09:54,320 --> 00:09:55,920
it's a bit it's the elite units across

337
00:09:55,920 --> 00:09:57,440
all the armed forces

338
00:09:57,440 --> 00:09:58,640
and uh you know there are a couple

339
00:09:58,640 --> 00:09:59,920
dynamics there right is that there's

340
00:09:59,920 --> 00:10:00,880
being soundly

341
00:10:00,880 --> 00:10:02,320
you know their goal is to capture

342
00:10:02,320 --> 00:10:04,000
al-qaeda iraq leaders right then there

343
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:04,399
was

344
00:10:04,399 --> 00:10:07,040
sound of being beaten could not site

345
00:10:07,040 --> 00:10:08,320
could not capture

346
00:10:08,320 --> 00:10:10,000
and one of the problems that they uh he

347
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:11,680
says in the book is that the

348
00:10:11,680 --> 00:10:14,079
team was the boundary of which everyone

349
00:10:14,079 --> 00:10:14,800
else sucks

350
00:10:14,800 --> 00:10:16,160
right so when you're part of an elite

351
00:10:16,160 --> 00:10:18,720
unit right you're better than every

352
00:10:18,720 --> 00:10:19,120
other

353
00:10:19,120 --> 00:10:20,480
army ranger unit and you're certainly

354
00:10:20,480 --> 00:10:21,680
better than navy seals and you're

355
00:10:21,680 --> 00:10:22,959
certainly better than the intelligence

356
00:10:22,959 --> 00:10:23,760
analysts

357
00:10:23,760 --> 00:10:26,160
uh and so what this caused is um you

358
00:10:26,160 --> 00:10:27,680
know essentially just a massively

359
00:10:27,680 --> 00:10:28,480
paraphrase

360
00:10:28,480 --> 00:10:29,680
they would you know the army rangers go

361
00:10:29,680 --> 00:10:31,519
on raids they would put all the uh

362
00:10:31,519 --> 00:10:33,200
captured intelligence into garbage bags

363
00:10:33,200 --> 00:10:34,240
right give them to the intelligence

364
00:10:34,240 --> 00:10:35,760
agents right the navy seals go off on

365
00:10:35,760 --> 00:10:36,959
their own mission right they're

366
00:10:36,959 --> 00:10:38,720
not really working towards a common

367
00:10:38,720 --> 00:10:40,240
objective um

368
00:10:40,240 --> 00:10:42,079
and and so part of the structural

369
00:10:42,079 --> 00:10:43,440
changes was really

370
00:10:43,440 --> 00:10:46,640
to go from functional silos uh you know

371
00:10:46,640 --> 00:10:49,920
uh to kind of these more shorter medium

372
00:10:49,920 --> 00:10:53,040
term mission teams right so uh so the

373
00:10:53,040 --> 00:10:54,399
army rangers still report up to the

374
00:10:54,399 --> 00:10:56,079
secretary of the army right navy seal

375
00:10:56,079 --> 00:10:57,440
still reports the secretary of the navy

376
00:10:57,440 --> 00:10:58,160
right um

377
00:10:58,160 --> 00:11:00,560
but they can integrate together right to

378
00:11:00,560 --> 00:11:01,279
uh

379
00:11:01,279 --> 00:11:03,519
um you know defeat the adversary so

380
00:11:03,519 --> 00:11:04,640
there's a great story that they went

381
00:11:04,640 --> 00:11:06,320
from sighting to capture in 40 minutes

382
00:11:06,320 --> 00:11:07,839
which was incredible

383
00:11:07,839 --> 00:11:11,120
so um uh so you could call that a matrix

384
00:11:11,120 --> 00:11:12,640
organization and you call those guilds

385
00:11:12,640 --> 00:11:14,320
right you have the army guild the navy

386
00:11:14,320 --> 00:11:15,600
guild and so forth

387
00:11:15,600 --> 00:11:17,600
right and so they are responsible for

388
00:11:17,600 --> 00:11:18,959
you know preparedness

389
00:11:18,959 --> 00:11:21,360
uh training standards right you know

390
00:11:21,360 --> 00:11:22,000
equipment

391
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:23,600
right they're all responsible for

392
00:11:23,600 --> 00:11:25,279
equipping their own but then they get

393
00:11:25,279 --> 00:11:26,880
assembled kind of at the unit level

394
00:11:26,880 --> 00:11:27,600
towards

395
00:11:27,600 --> 00:11:30,000
a certain mission so i think um guilds

396
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:30,880
really do

397
00:11:30,880 --> 00:11:33,040
i would say that's a great example where

398
00:11:33,040 --> 00:11:34,480
navy seals may now have a lot to say

399
00:11:34,480 --> 00:11:36,000
about like how army rangers should or

400
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:36,480
shouldn't

401
00:11:36,480 --> 00:11:39,040
do something right um but then so

402
00:11:39,040 --> 00:11:40,320
they're responsible for their own and

403
00:11:40,320 --> 00:11:40,800
yet

404
00:11:40,800 --> 00:11:43,120
um you know they must integrate together

405
00:11:43,120 --> 00:11:44,240
uh to solve

406
00:11:44,240 --> 00:11:47,519
mission objectives so um you know i

407
00:11:47,519 --> 00:11:49,519
i think it's uh to me that's a

408
00:11:49,519 --> 00:11:51,040
demonstration that can be done

409
00:11:51,040 --> 00:11:52,560
uh and i would propose that that's a

410
00:11:52,560 --> 00:11:54,399
great model and you know i'll be honest

411
00:11:54,399 --> 00:11:55,040
i'm sort of

412
00:11:55,040 --> 00:11:56,880
uh not connecting the dots all the way

413
00:11:56,880 --> 00:11:58,399
down to say how you do it

414
00:11:58,399 --> 00:12:01,519
uh but i am confident that um

415
00:12:01,519 --> 00:12:04,480
like qa infosec right uh become great

416
00:12:04,480 --> 00:12:05,680
not by hanging out with developers all

417
00:12:05,680 --> 00:12:06,399
day they

418
00:12:06,399 --> 00:12:07,600
they become great by hanging out with

419
00:12:07,600 --> 00:12:09,760
the best security and qa people

420
00:12:09,760 --> 00:12:13,600
right uh and so uh clearly guilds

421
00:12:13,600 --> 00:12:15,519
have a lot uh you know functional

422
00:12:15,519 --> 00:12:17,360
expertise must be

423
00:12:17,360 --> 00:12:20,959
uh grown standards must be created um

424
00:12:20,959 --> 00:12:22,560
and yet it doesn't mean that we're all

425
00:12:22,560 --> 00:12:24,000
siloed right

426
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:25,440
does that resonate with you yeah it

427
00:12:25,440 --> 00:12:27,120
resonates with me especially the

428
00:12:27,120 --> 00:12:28,639
the area that you're talking about when

429
00:12:28,639 --> 00:12:30,240
it comes to um

430
00:12:30,240 --> 00:12:31,839
common objectives right because i feel

431
00:12:31,839 --> 00:12:33,440
like when you have this sort of design

432
00:12:33,440 --> 00:12:34,800
by committee that goes nowhere

433
00:12:34,800 --> 00:12:36,000
it's because everyone's looking out for

434
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:37,440
their own interests or their own little

435
00:12:37,440 --> 00:12:38,160
vertical

436
00:12:38,160 --> 00:12:40,079
so because we don't have these sort of

437
00:12:40,079 --> 00:12:41,519
common objectives these common

438
00:12:41,519 --> 00:12:42,240
priorities

439
00:12:42,240 --> 00:12:43,920
everyone's protecting themselves the

440
00:12:43,920 --> 00:12:45,279
minute we're all sort of

441
00:12:45,279 --> 00:12:47,600
uh marching in the same direction it's

442
00:12:47,600 --> 00:12:48,639
very easy to say

443
00:12:48,639 --> 00:12:50,480
well i really don't have to have a

444
00:12:50,480 --> 00:12:52,959
comment on that right

445
00:12:52,959 --> 00:12:54,720
right i don't i don't have to you know

446
00:12:54,720 --> 00:12:56,320
uh really fight you

447
00:12:56,320 --> 00:13:00,399
on you know java versus node.js

448
00:13:00,399 --> 00:13:02,560
as a security person i have some really

449
00:13:02,560 --> 00:13:04,240
you know uh at what point does that

450
00:13:04,240 --> 00:13:05,760
my opinion really matter for mission

451
00:13:05,760 --> 00:13:07,200
achievement right let the developers

452
00:13:07,200 --> 00:13:08,399
choose what they need to achieve the

453
00:13:08,399 --> 00:13:09,519
mission right the

454
00:13:09,519 --> 00:13:11,519
uh and the ops people infrastructure

455
00:13:11,519 --> 00:13:12,880
people so forth so

456
00:13:12,880 --> 00:13:16,000
right um another question uh

457
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:17,680
what is the one question that you get

458
00:13:17,680 --> 00:13:20,720
asked the most

459
00:13:20,720 --> 00:13:24,320
question that i get asked uh the most um

460
00:13:24,320 --> 00:13:26,959
what goes wrong uh uh you know what what

461
00:13:26,959 --> 00:13:28,079
almost often goes wrong when

462
00:13:28,079 --> 00:13:30,000
organizations try to transform

463
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:33,440
and um uh you know the answer to that uh

464
00:13:33,440 --> 00:13:34,720
you know is you know i think it's about

465
00:13:34,720 --> 00:13:36,079
scoping my area of passion really has

466
00:13:36,079 --> 00:13:37,120
been studying

467
00:13:37,120 --> 00:13:39,360
you know how large complex organizations

468
00:13:39,360 --> 00:13:41,040
uh adopt every

469
00:13:41,040 --> 00:13:43,360
lesson you know everything that the tech

470
00:13:43,360 --> 00:13:44,079
giants

471
00:13:44,079 --> 00:13:46,079
pioneered facebook amazon netflix google

472
00:13:46,079 --> 00:13:47,440
all right and now being incorporated to

473
00:13:47,440 --> 00:13:48,079
every

474
00:13:48,079 --> 00:13:50,320
modern organization across every

475
00:13:50,320 --> 00:13:51,519
industry vertical

476
00:13:51,519 --> 00:13:54,160
and that we use the devops enterprise

477
00:13:54,160 --> 00:13:54,959
summit as a way

478
00:13:54,959 --> 00:13:56,160
for these organizations to share

479
00:13:56,160 --> 00:13:57,600
experiences and what i find so

480
00:13:57,600 --> 00:13:58,880
interesting are the ones that succeed

481
00:13:58,880 --> 00:14:00,240
are the ones that scope it

482
00:14:00,240 --> 00:14:02,079
just right the ones that fail in my

483
00:14:02,079 --> 00:14:03,600
opinion are the ones that are

484
00:14:03,600 --> 00:14:05,040
you know these big bang approaches they

485
00:14:05,040 --> 00:14:07,040
try to boil the ocean uh

486
00:14:07,040 --> 00:14:08,480
uh you know there's no need for

487
00:14:08,480 --> 00:14:10,480
immediate urgent wins uh

488
00:14:10,480 --> 00:14:12,880
or the scope's so small that like when

489
00:14:12,880 --> 00:14:14,079
you show off what you did everyone

490
00:14:14,079 --> 00:14:15,120
laughs at you

491
00:14:15,120 --> 00:14:16,639
because they're like that's that looks

492
00:14:16,639 --> 00:14:18,560
like a hospital right yeah

493
00:14:18,560 --> 00:14:22,719
exactly like like uh you know

494
00:14:22,959 --> 00:14:26,079
whatever you're doing stop right so

495
00:14:26,079 --> 00:14:27,600
so uh you know to me that really is

496
00:14:27,600 --> 00:14:29,120
about like picking the right problem and

497
00:14:29,120 --> 00:14:30,480
scoping it so that you know you have a

498
00:14:30,480 --> 00:14:31,760
reasonable shot for success and you're

499
00:14:31,760 --> 00:14:33,040
using it to build a business case to do

500
00:14:33,040 --> 00:14:34,320
more of it

501
00:14:34,320 --> 00:14:36,880
awesome um question for gene what's the

502
00:14:36,880 --> 00:14:38,480
coolest book you read in the last year

503
00:14:38,480 --> 00:14:39,199
and why

504
00:14:39,199 --> 00:14:42,639
oh yeah um uh so i mentioned one of them

505
00:14:42,639 --> 00:14:43,440
team of teams

506
00:14:43,440 --> 00:14:44,880
uh which i it did read technically more

507
00:14:44,880 --> 00:14:46,880
than a year ago but uh uh

508
00:14:46,880 --> 00:14:49,440
you know i i studied that book

509
00:14:49,440 --> 00:14:50,079
especially

510
00:14:50,079 --> 00:14:52,079
uh in the makings of the unicorn project

511
00:14:52,079 --> 00:14:54,000
i just thought it was such a great

512
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:57,519
um metaphor it was a great analog of uh

513
00:14:57,519 --> 00:14:58,880
solving a devops like problem and

514
00:14:58,880 --> 00:15:00,720
something that looks nothing like devops

515
00:15:00,720 --> 00:15:03,760
uh another book that i love um that uh

516
00:15:03,760 --> 00:15:05,440
shows up in the book very prominently

517
00:15:05,440 --> 00:15:06,880
i i think i'm gonna have to defend a

518
00:15:06,880 --> 00:15:08,480
little bit because people laugh at me

519
00:15:08,480 --> 00:15:10,399
uh which is a transforming nokia book by

520
00:15:10,399 --> 00:15:12,079
aristo salasma

521
00:15:12,079 --> 00:15:13,760
incredible book right and you know i'll

522
00:15:13,760 --> 00:15:15,199
just say it right why would you read a

523
00:15:15,199 --> 00:15:15,920
book

524
00:15:15,920 --> 00:15:18,320
by the person who oversaw the decimation

525
00:15:18,320 --> 00:15:19,600
of the 93

526
00:15:19,600 --> 00:15:21,600
of the market cap of nokia right i mean

527
00:15:21,600 --> 00:15:23,040
as a board member

528
00:15:23,040 --> 00:15:25,440
yeah right right so i had the same

529
00:15:25,440 --> 00:15:26,720
reaction but it was incredible

530
00:15:26,720 --> 00:15:30,000
i mean um i i'll give like four reasons

531
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:30,399
one

532
00:15:30,399 --> 00:15:33,600
is here's a person who just he was so

533
00:15:33,600 --> 00:15:35,839
um honest right he said it was his dream

534
00:15:35,839 --> 00:15:37,440
job right they'd be invited of this on

535
00:15:37,440 --> 00:15:38,800
the board of nokia

536
00:15:38,800 --> 00:15:40,800
and then he said like uh it was this

537
00:15:40,800 --> 00:15:42,240
unflinching look of

538
00:15:42,240 --> 00:15:44,800
how he was not effective uh not listened

539
00:15:44,800 --> 00:15:46,560
to not couldn't persuade people

540
00:15:46,560 --> 00:15:48,240
because of an overly domineering

541
00:15:48,240 --> 00:15:50,160
chairperson right that was also the ceo

542
00:15:50,160 --> 00:15:51,040
i mean it's like oh

543
00:15:51,040 --> 00:15:54,160
unflinching it was awesome two is um it

544
00:15:54,160 --> 00:15:55,120
describes

545
00:15:55,120 --> 00:15:58,320
um how oh yeah the famous quote like

546
00:15:58,320 --> 00:16:00,639
he said in 2010 when he learned from the

547
00:16:00,639 --> 00:16:01,680
vp of strategy

548
00:16:01,680 --> 00:16:04,720
that to the build times for the nokia as

549
00:16:04,720 --> 00:16:06,160
for the symbian os

550
00:16:06,160 --> 00:16:08,399
of which everything hinged upon was two

551
00:16:08,399 --> 00:16:09,839
days he said it felt like being hit in

552
00:16:09,839 --> 00:16:11,360
the head with a sledgehammer

553
00:16:11,360 --> 00:16:13,920
and he said if it if any developer needs

554
00:16:13,920 --> 00:16:14,880
two days to

555
00:16:14,880 --> 00:16:16,720
learn if their change worked or would

556
00:16:16,720 --> 00:16:18,160
have to be redone that's like

557
00:16:18,160 --> 00:16:19,759
this is an illusion this is never gonna

558
00:16:19,759 --> 00:16:21,120
work right and so they switch to windows

559
00:16:21,120 --> 00:16:22,560
mobile which was not so good for them

560
00:16:22,560 --> 00:16:24,880
either but it was a better bet than

561
00:16:24,880 --> 00:16:26,079
staying on uh

562
00:16:26,079 --> 00:16:28,639
on symbian os and you know third it was

563
00:16:28,639 --> 00:16:30,079
this incredible inside story of like how

564
00:16:30,079 --> 00:16:31,120
they got acquired

565
00:16:31,120 --> 00:16:34,480
uh by microsoft for 7.8 billion dollars

566
00:16:34,480 --> 00:16:35,839
when there were probably about 60 days

567
00:16:35,839 --> 00:16:37,040
from running out of money and going out

568
00:16:37,040 --> 00:16:37,600
of business

569
00:16:37,600 --> 00:16:39,360
right it was just incredible that's

570
00:16:39,360 --> 00:16:41,199
awesome right there oh yeah

571
00:16:41,199 --> 00:16:42,399
it was a great book i would recommend

572
00:16:42,399 --> 00:16:43,680
everyone and plus there's a really great

573
00:16:43,680 --> 00:16:44,720
angle about culture

574
00:16:44,720 --> 00:16:47,040
and data anyway so it's just a

575
00:16:47,040 --> 00:16:48,240
hands-down probably the best book i've

576
00:16:48,240 --> 00:16:48,959
read in last

577
00:16:48,959 --> 00:16:51,199
two years you know it's ironic because

578
00:16:51,199 --> 00:16:53,199
when you said when you said nokia i kind

579
00:16:53,199 --> 00:16:54,959
of giggled to myself

580
00:16:54,959 --> 00:16:56,639
but it's ironic that we don't we don't

581
00:16:56,639 --> 00:16:58,240
apply that same logic to everything we

582
00:16:58,240 --> 00:16:59,360
do right we talk about learning from

583
00:16:59,360 --> 00:17:01,199
failure all the time right and here is a

584
00:17:01,199 --> 00:17:03,040
book that is laying bare

585
00:17:03,040 --> 00:17:04,799
a pretty massive failure and it's like

586
00:17:04,799 --> 00:17:07,359
why would you read that

587
00:17:07,359 --> 00:17:09,280
learn anything from those doesn't it

588
00:17:09,280 --> 00:17:11,599
right yeah it was just uh oh man

589
00:17:11,599 --> 00:17:12,640
i remember texting people in the middle

590
00:17:12,640 --> 00:17:14,480
of life like you know page after page

591
00:17:14,480 --> 00:17:16,000
like oh my gosh

592
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:18,559
it was just a brilliant brilliant book

593
00:17:18,559 --> 00:17:19,280
awesome

594
00:17:19,280 --> 00:17:22,319
all right uh next one uh when

595
00:17:22,319 --> 00:17:24,880
speaking to one who is not familiar or

596
00:17:24,880 --> 00:17:26,400
incorrectly familiar with devops what

597
00:17:26,400 --> 00:17:27,679
would be your three-minute elevator

598
00:17:27,679 --> 00:17:29,600
pitch to help them achieve enlightenment

599
00:17:29,600 --> 00:17:30,960
oh yeah i don't even need three minutes

600
00:17:30,960 --> 00:17:32,720
i'm gonna quote my friend uh

601
00:17:32,720 --> 00:17:36,640
uh jonathan um

602
00:17:36,640 --> 00:17:40,080
uh john smart uh who for many years led

603
00:17:40,080 --> 00:17:42,000
the better ways of working at barclays

604
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:44,720
founded in the year 1634 which predates

605
00:17:44,720 --> 00:17:46,400
the invention of paper cash by you know

606
00:17:46,400 --> 00:17:48,080
uh at least 50 years

607
00:17:48,080 --> 00:17:51,120
and he said uh you know devops is just

608
00:17:51,120 --> 00:17:53,919
better value sooner safer happier right

609
00:17:53,919 --> 00:17:54,160
and

610
00:17:54,160 --> 00:17:57,440
i just love that because you know in

611
00:17:57,440 --> 00:18:00,080
better sooner safer happier four words

612
00:18:00,080 --> 00:18:01,280
maybe five

613
00:18:01,280 --> 00:18:03,760
um he summed up essentially what we

614
00:18:03,760 --> 00:18:05,200
found in the state of devops research

615
00:18:05,200 --> 00:18:06,640
right uh you know

616
00:18:06,640 --> 00:18:08,480
deploy more frequently some more safely

617
00:18:08,480 --> 00:18:09,679
you know a higher playing

618
00:18:09,679 --> 00:18:12,320
promoter scores right it's just a uh i

619
00:18:12,320 --> 00:18:13,840
couldn't imagine a better way to land

620
00:18:13,840 --> 00:18:15,280
the punch more succinctly and you know

621
00:18:15,280 --> 00:18:16,400
what i love about it is

622
00:18:16,400 --> 00:18:19,039
who can argue that we shouldn't have uh

623
00:18:19,039 --> 00:18:19,520
way

624
00:18:19,520 --> 00:18:20,880
shouldn't be creating ways of working

625
00:18:20,880 --> 00:18:22,640
that make us better

626
00:18:22,640 --> 00:18:25,440
sooner safer and happier right uh it'll

627
00:18:25,440 --> 00:18:27,440
take a very peculiar person to object to

628
00:18:27,440 --> 00:18:29,840
any or all of those right so we'd like

629
00:18:29,840 --> 00:18:31,280
to stand on right like yeah we don't

630
00:18:31,280 --> 00:18:32,400
need any of that

631
00:18:32,400 --> 00:18:36,480
yeah everybody's like happier right

632
00:18:36,480 --> 00:18:40,000
so it makes a great case yeah absolutely

633
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:41,120
all right with the recognition that

634
00:18:41,120 --> 00:18:43,280
silos are inevitable even necessary how

635
00:18:43,280 --> 00:18:45,120
can we make space for leaders in each

636
00:18:45,120 --> 00:18:46,320
silo

637
00:18:46,320 --> 00:18:48,080
by the way uh jeff you are amazing to

638
00:18:48,080 --> 00:18:49,440
watch from afar and then from

639
00:18:49,440 --> 00:18:50,960
up close seeing you actually typing

640
00:18:50,960 --> 00:18:52,480
these questions into this thing i

641
00:18:52,480 --> 00:18:53,760
don't know how you're doing it but it is

642
00:18:53,760 --> 00:18:56,160
amazing i got back up my buddy

643
00:18:56,160 --> 00:18:57,679
our man mike hopped in the channel he's

644
00:18:57,679 --> 00:19:01,600
handling questions nice job mike

645
00:19:02,480 --> 00:19:04,160
that's incredible from from this

646
00:19:04,160 --> 00:19:05,520
perspective just like you wheeled it

647
00:19:05,520 --> 00:19:06,160
into being

648
00:19:06,160 --> 00:19:08,400
you know using only your brain uh thank

649
00:19:08,400 --> 00:19:10,960
you mike and thank you jeff uh

650
00:19:10,960 --> 00:19:13,440
um

651
00:19:15,919 --> 00:19:18,799
that's a great question um yeah we need

652
00:19:18,799 --> 00:19:19,679
leaders right i mean

653
00:19:19,679 --> 00:19:22,000
just let me like without leaders we're a

654
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:23,280
mob right uh

655
00:19:23,280 --> 00:19:24,559
i think we've all been in situations

656
00:19:24,559 --> 00:19:26,400
where you know we want to

657
00:19:26,400 --> 00:19:27,919
we have a big problem and we need to

658
00:19:27,919 --> 00:19:29,520
decompose the work so that teams can

659
00:19:29,520 --> 00:19:30,960
actually meet independently because we

660
00:19:30,960 --> 00:19:32,000
can't have

661
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:35,919
meetings of 50 people all the time

662
00:19:35,919 --> 00:19:37,200
and then in the beginning you probably

663
00:19:37,200 --> 00:19:38,799
do right you know we keep uh keep

664
00:19:38,799 --> 00:19:39,919
everyone in the same room so that we can

665
00:19:39,919 --> 00:19:41,440
sort of understand how to organize a

666
00:19:41,440 --> 00:19:42,799
problem and how we can make it so that

667
00:19:42,799 --> 00:19:43,200
we can

668
00:19:43,200 --> 00:19:44,799
you know small solve small pieces of the

669
00:19:44,799 --> 00:19:46,240
problem without having to communicate

670
00:19:46,240 --> 00:19:47,679
coordinate martial sequence get

671
00:19:47,679 --> 00:19:48,480
permission

672
00:19:48,480 --> 00:19:51,120
etc so you know i agree right this uh

673
00:19:51,120 --> 00:19:52,960
leaders emerge not just because of silos

674
00:19:52,960 --> 00:19:53,679
but you you

675
00:19:53,679 --> 00:19:56,559
it's part of the decomposition of uh how

676
00:19:56,559 --> 00:19:58,000
we solve problems

677
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:01,360
um and we also need experts right i

678
00:20:01,360 --> 00:20:02,400
think if you look in the healthcare

679
00:20:02,400 --> 00:20:03,120
field

680
00:20:03,120 --> 00:20:05,039
um you know there used to be kind of two

681
00:20:05,039 --> 00:20:06,640
specialties like the doctors and the

682
00:20:06,640 --> 00:20:07,200
nurses

683
00:20:07,200 --> 00:20:09,039
but now you have like you know look in

684
00:20:09,039 --> 00:20:11,280
the modern hospital like uh

685
00:20:11,280 --> 00:20:13,919
you know pre-covid right i mean that was

686
00:20:13,919 --> 00:20:14,559
uh

687
00:20:14,559 --> 00:20:16,960
you know to help a major patient you

688
00:20:16,960 --> 00:20:18,640
probably need 50 specialties right you

689
00:20:18,640 --> 00:20:20,960
need radiology you need uh

690
00:20:20,960 --> 00:20:24,080
the uh you know pharmacy transportation

691
00:20:24,080 --> 00:20:25,360
you need uh

692
00:20:25,360 --> 00:20:27,760
anesthesia yeah exactly and um you know

693
00:20:27,760 --> 00:20:29,679
just the amount of handoffs right um

694
00:20:29,679 --> 00:20:32,799
oh and in fact because uh people

695
00:20:32,799 --> 00:20:34,559
the general practitioner the personal

696
00:20:34,559 --> 00:20:35,919
doctor doesn't come to the hospital

697
00:20:35,919 --> 00:20:36,559
anymore right

698
00:20:36,559 --> 00:20:40,000
there's a new role called the the the

699
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:41,600
knock turn uh that's i can't remember

700
00:20:41,600 --> 00:20:43,440
this is basically the proxy for the

701
00:20:43,440 --> 00:20:44,480
general care

702
00:20:44,480 --> 00:20:46,799
practitioner so you need functional you

703
00:20:46,799 --> 00:20:48,640
you do need those silos because you have

704
00:20:48,640 --> 00:20:49,600
uh more and more

705
00:20:49,600 --> 00:20:51,600
uh functional experts so how do we make

706
00:20:51,600 --> 00:20:53,280
space for leaders yeah i just uh i think

707
00:20:53,280 --> 00:20:54,880
that it really is about

708
00:20:54,880 --> 00:20:56,880
um i would almost turn it the other way

709
00:20:56,880 --> 00:20:58,640
around what do we need from leaders

710
00:20:58,640 --> 00:21:00,400
we need leaders to help the team solve

711
00:21:00,400 --> 00:21:03,360
problems to eliminate obstacles

712
00:21:03,360 --> 00:21:05,840
to enable right everything that the the

713
00:21:05,840 --> 00:21:07,440
people on the front lines need in order

714
00:21:07,440 --> 00:21:08,640
to achieve the goals right

715
00:21:08,640 --> 00:21:10,480
you know all those obstacles those are

716
00:21:10,480 --> 00:21:11,840
things that we need to task our leaders

717
00:21:11,840 --> 00:21:12,799
to do

718
00:21:12,799 --> 00:21:16,000
um and and so in the magic world

719
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:18,080
right the teams can get sort of like an

720
00:21:18,080 --> 00:21:19,200
animal farm

721
00:21:19,200 --> 00:21:21,120
right everyone take only takes what they

722
00:21:21,120 --> 00:21:23,360
need and does always what that

723
00:21:23,360 --> 00:21:26,000
is best right in a total selfless world

724
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:27,360
i think we you know in

725
00:21:27,360 --> 00:21:28,880
if we haven't achieved that utopian

726
00:21:28,880 --> 00:21:30,320
ideal then we do need leaders to help

727
00:21:30,320 --> 00:21:31,440
expedite and help

728
00:21:31,440 --> 00:21:33,520
prioritize you know play politics and

729
00:21:33,520 --> 00:21:35,039
help marshall and sequence

730
00:21:35,039 --> 00:21:36,880
things right so that we can achieve the

731
00:21:36,880 --> 00:21:39,360
grandest goals of the organization

732
00:21:39,360 --> 00:21:41,360
all right what are your recommendations

733
00:21:41,360 --> 00:21:43,360
accelerate both success and failure

734
00:21:43,360 --> 00:21:44,880
how can we make sure they're both

735
00:21:44,880 --> 00:21:46,559
recognized as essential to growth

736
00:21:46,559 --> 00:21:47,840
another great question

737
00:21:47,840 --> 00:21:50,400
yeah you know um so i mentioned i've

738
00:21:50,400 --> 00:21:52,159
been having these uh calls with uh dr

739
00:21:52,159 --> 00:21:52,880
steven speer

740
00:21:52,880 --> 00:21:54,640
and studying team team studying uh

741
00:21:54,640 --> 00:21:56,480
whatever i'll tell you like

742
00:21:56,480 --> 00:21:59,200
what's making me one thing that's kind

743
00:21:59,200 --> 00:22:01,600
of becoming clear to me is that

744
00:22:01,600 --> 00:22:04,559
uh is that there's a way does it we can

745
00:22:04,559 --> 00:22:06,080
kind of create

746
00:22:06,080 --> 00:22:08,640
this hyper kind of mechanistic imagine

747
00:22:08,640 --> 00:22:09,840
if you can sort of explain the world

748
00:22:09,840 --> 00:22:11,360
using only just a couple of constructs

749
00:22:11,360 --> 00:22:12,799
you have structure

750
00:22:12,799 --> 00:22:14,960
dynamics well structural dynamics

751
00:22:14,960 --> 00:22:16,400
structure is like the way we organize

752
00:22:16,400 --> 00:22:17,919
our teams and the architecture we work

753
00:22:17,919 --> 00:22:18,640
within

754
00:22:18,640 --> 00:22:20,640
and dynamics is almost everything else

755
00:22:20,640 --> 00:22:22,799
it's like the culture norms you set

756
00:22:22,799 --> 00:22:25,280
but dynamics also kind of are about how

757
00:22:25,280 --> 00:22:27,039
do we emit signals and how do we receive

758
00:22:27,039 --> 00:22:28,080
signals and i think

759
00:22:28,080 --> 00:22:31,520
to this one to your question is like

760
00:22:31,520 --> 00:22:33,039
are we creating an environment where

761
00:22:33,039 --> 00:22:34,640
signals are amplified

762
00:22:34,640 --> 00:22:37,919
or are we creating a uh an organization

763
00:22:37,919 --> 00:22:40,000
or dynamic where signals are suppressed

764
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:41,120
or extinguished

765
00:22:41,120 --> 00:22:43,039
right so there's a narrative that says

766
00:22:43,039 --> 00:22:44,320
you know the space shuttle

767
00:22:44,320 --> 00:22:47,840
uh you know launched and uh uh you know

768
00:22:47,840 --> 00:22:49,840
one uh was the challenger was lost

769
00:22:49,840 --> 00:22:51,360
because of uh you know

770
00:22:51,360 --> 00:22:53,280
phone breakage and so forth right and

771
00:22:53,280 --> 00:22:54,559
there's an argument to be made that

772
00:22:54,559 --> 00:22:55,840
we suppressed a signal that should have

773
00:22:55,840 --> 00:22:57,600
been amplified right that when it's not

774
00:22:57,600 --> 00:22:58,880
safe to tell bad news

775
00:22:58,880 --> 00:23:00,880
right we're suppressing signals and you

776
00:23:00,880 --> 00:23:02,480
know i think when there's a culture of

777
00:23:02,480 --> 00:23:02,799
uh

778
00:23:02,799 --> 00:23:07,120
safety like in the unicorn project uh uh

779
00:23:07,120 --> 00:23:09,280
paul o'neil the ceo of alcoa right he

780
00:23:09,280 --> 00:23:11,039
would talk at every town hall about

781
00:23:11,039 --> 00:23:11,440
every

782
00:23:11,440 --> 00:23:14,080
injury uh uh to an alcohol and what was

783
00:23:14,080 --> 00:23:14,720
done

784
00:23:14,720 --> 00:23:16,559
to as a result to make sure that they

785
00:23:16,559 --> 00:23:18,320
could achieve their goal of no workplace

786
00:23:18,320 --> 00:23:18,880
injuries

787
00:23:18,880 --> 00:23:21,280
ever right um yeah i think those are the

788
00:23:21,280 --> 00:23:22,320
things that

789
00:23:22,320 --> 00:23:24,320
amplify signals right and and so i

790
00:23:24,320 --> 00:23:25,520
believe that uh

791
00:23:25,520 --> 00:23:26,799
you know even though it does seem very

792
00:23:26,799 --> 00:23:28,960
simplistic um you know

793
00:23:28,960 --> 00:23:31,440
uh this question is all about how do we

794
00:23:31,440 --> 00:23:32,960
sort of amplify signals and we do that

795
00:23:32,960 --> 00:23:34,559
by celebrating successes

796
00:23:34,559 --> 00:23:36,559
we also celebrate failures we um you

797
00:23:36,559 --> 00:23:38,000
know we uh

798
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:40,240
you know we celebrate when projects end

799
00:23:40,240 --> 00:23:41,679
right because we don't want projects to

800
00:23:41,679 --> 00:23:42,480
go on

801
00:23:42,480 --> 00:23:44,400
forever even though the you know

802
00:23:44,400 --> 00:23:45,679
everyone knows it's going to die we need

803
00:23:45,679 --> 00:23:46,799
to

804
00:23:46,799 --> 00:23:50,080
encourage people not to to kill it early

805
00:23:50,080 --> 00:23:53,120
and not hide bad news right and you know

806
00:23:53,120 --> 00:23:54,559
your point about you know referencing

807
00:23:54,559 --> 00:23:56,480
the the paul o'neill and that particular

808
00:23:56,480 --> 00:23:57,360
scene i remember

809
00:23:57,360 --> 00:23:58,720
talking about that at book club because

810
00:23:58,720 --> 00:24:00,400
it was like imagine what it would be

811
00:24:00,400 --> 00:24:00,960
like if

812
00:24:00,960 --> 00:24:02,640
every incident was talked about at the

813
00:24:02,640 --> 00:24:04,720
town hall right like like if every major

814
00:24:04,720 --> 00:24:07,039
outage and the ceo was talking about it

815
00:24:07,039 --> 00:24:08,720
now you're not you're not forced to

816
00:24:08,720 --> 00:24:10,400
wrangle people into these post-mortems

817
00:24:10,400 --> 00:24:11,440
right like come on we got

818
00:24:11,440 --> 00:24:12,799
we got to do this thing you know we need

819
00:24:12,799 --> 00:24:14,799
to prioritize this work when the ceo's

820
00:24:14,799 --> 00:24:16,000
up there taking accountability and

821
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:16,880
talking about it

822
00:24:16,880 --> 00:24:18,320
at a at the top level of the

823
00:24:18,320 --> 00:24:20,159
organization it's just it's a beautiful

824
00:24:20,159 --> 00:24:20,880
thing

825
00:24:20,880 --> 00:24:22,880
and when the true north is stated right

826
00:24:22,880 --> 00:24:24,960
our goal is right zero injuries or our

827
00:24:24,960 --> 00:24:25,919
goal is uh

828
00:24:25,919 --> 00:24:28,080
you know um uh you know the equivalent

829
00:24:28,080 --> 00:24:29,760
like we don't want um

830
00:24:29,760 --> 00:24:31,840
uh you know technology issues to cause

831
00:24:31,840 --> 00:24:33,440
our customers harm what does it take

832
00:24:33,440 --> 00:24:35,760
right and yeah and my job is to help

833
00:24:35,760 --> 00:24:36,559
enable that

834
00:24:36,559 --> 00:24:38,320
to happen you tell me what you need my

835
00:24:38,320 --> 00:24:39,679
job is to get it for you

836
00:24:39,679 --> 00:24:41,120
all right we got about four minutes left

837
00:24:41,120 --> 00:24:42,400
we're gonna go on the lightning round

838
00:24:42,400 --> 00:24:43,279
here all right

839
00:24:43,279 --> 00:24:45,840
uh i think the devops cultures bring i.t

840
00:24:45,840 --> 00:24:46,640
life again

841
00:24:46,640 --> 00:24:48,559
quality of life empathy collaboration i

842
00:24:48,559 --> 00:24:50,000
worked a lot of time with ops do you

843
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:50,960
think to write

844
00:24:50,960 --> 00:24:53,919
another book um it says questions do you

845
00:24:53,919 --> 00:24:54,640
guys think

846
00:24:54,640 --> 00:24:57,120
yeah um

847
00:24:57,919 --> 00:25:00,880
yes maybe in about a year i might be in

848
00:25:00,880 --> 00:25:01,760
a position where

849
00:25:01,760 --> 00:25:04,799
uh uh i might have some being about

850
00:25:04,799 --> 00:25:05,840
where i could actually talk about but

851
00:25:05,840 --> 00:25:06,559
yeah

852
00:25:06,559 --> 00:25:07,760
and maybe just to answer the question

853
00:25:07,760 --> 00:25:08,880
right you know for me i really

854
00:25:08,880 --> 00:25:09,840
self-identify

855
00:25:09,840 --> 00:25:11,679
primarily as a writer right and a

856
00:25:11,679 --> 00:25:14,400
programmer but uh um you know it's for

857
00:25:14,400 --> 00:25:15,679
me it really is about researching

858
00:25:15,679 --> 00:25:17,360
hanging out with the best in game and

859
00:25:17,360 --> 00:25:19,200
um you know getting those on paper

860
00:25:19,200 --> 00:25:20,960
that's that's the work i love most

861
00:25:20,960 --> 00:25:22,400
and by the way congratulations on your

862
00:25:22,400 --> 00:25:24,559
upcoming book jeff that is uh

863
00:25:24,559 --> 00:25:27,279
in fact i look forward to uh getting a

864
00:25:27,279 --> 00:25:28,080
review draft

865
00:25:28,080 --> 00:25:30,159
uh so that i can uh see what your genius

866
00:25:30,159 --> 00:25:31,440
would come up with i'm literally

867
00:25:31,440 --> 00:25:33,279
dropping the last two chapters

868
00:25:33,279 --> 00:25:37,279
uh to the editor today so i'm excited

869
00:25:37,279 --> 00:25:40,400
congratulations drop me a dm when you're

870
00:25:40,400 --> 00:25:42,159
finished by the way we'll uh have a

871
00:25:42,159 --> 00:25:46,000
uh how do you see your role uh

872
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:47,360
how do you see role of senior tech

873
00:25:47,360 --> 00:25:49,039
managers evolving now that agile devops

874
00:25:49,039 --> 00:25:50,720
promotes self-organization are they just

875
00:25:50,720 --> 00:25:54,320
enablers cultural guards for teams

876
00:25:55,039 --> 00:25:57,919
no uh they're not just that although

877
00:25:57,919 --> 00:25:59,360
they certainly are that right uh the

878
00:25:59,360 --> 00:26:00,159
best leaders

879
00:26:00,159 --> 00:26:01,679
probably are the best enablers right

880
00:26:01,679 --> 00:26:03,279
they're the ones that best at busting

881
00:26:03,279 --> 00:26:04,720
down the biggest obstacles but uh

882
00:26:04,720 --> 00:26:05,840
ultimately i mean i think they're the

883
00:26:05,840 --> 00:26:08,000
best problem solvers right as you go get

884
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:09,360
higher in the organization

885
00:26:09,360 --> 00:26:10,480
you're being given more and more

886
00:26:10,480 --> 00:26:12,320
responsibility and more and more bigger

887
00:26:12,320 --> 00:26:13,600
problems to solve

888
00:26:13,600 --> 00:26:16,400
so um you know i'd like to think that

889
00:26:16,400 --> 00:26:17,679
the ones that

890
00:26:17,679 --> 00:26:20,880
rise to the top are the ones that are

891
00:26:20,880 --> 00:26:23,120
delivering the most impact positive

892
00:26:23,120 --> 00:26:24,960
impact to the organization and the

893
00:26:24,960 --> 00:26:26,640
reward for that is we give them

894
00:26:26,640 --> 00:26:28,159
bigger problems to solve that we care

895
00:26:28,159 --> 00:26:31,600
about whether our customers or us

896
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:35,440
all right how would you approach someone

897
00:26:35,440 --> 00:26:36,960
who hears for example the unicorn

898
00:26:36,960 --> 00:26:38,640
project and now's their head about the

899
00:26:38,640 --> 00:26:40,320
transformations that happen there but

900
00:26:40,320 --> 00:26:41,840
then are empathetic but

901
00:26:41,840 --> 00:26:45,120
uh emphatic that their industry

902
00:26:45,120 --> 00:26:48,400
is immune special or indifferent

903
00:26:48,400 --> 00:26:49,760
i was like where's the rest of the oh

904
00:26:49,760 --> 00:26:51,520
there it is we know how that ends

905
00:26:51,520 --> 00:26:54,880
thanks thanks dave um

906
00:26:54,880 --> 00:26:58,400
um yeah so

907
00:26:58,400 --> 00:27:00,720
i would say go look at all the devops

908
00:27:00,720 --> 00:27:02,320
enterprise plenary talks right and they

909
00:27:02,320 --> 00:27:04,159
are in probably more obscure

910
00:27:04,159 --> 00:27:06,320
more unlikely organizations uh than

911
00:27:06,320 --> 00:27:07,360
whatever industry

912
00:27:07,360 --> 00:27:09,360
you know this as a person might hail

913
00:27:09,360 --> 00:27:10,880
from and um

914
00:27:10,880 --> 00:27:12,400
you know i think even the unicorn

915
00:27:12,400 --> 00:27:14,240
project is a very unlikely place for

916
00:27:14,240 --> 00:27:16,960
a story like this right it's a it's a

917
00:27:16,960 --> 00:27:17,520
parts

918
00:27:17,520 --> 00:27:20,080
manufacturer it's a retailer right and

919
00:27:20,080 --> 00:27:20,799
so uh

920
00:27:20,799 --> 00:27:22,480
it was really meant to be the backwaters

921
00:27:22,480 --> 00:27:24,640
of uh technology and yet

922
00:27:24,640 --> 00:27:25,919
you know they created a culture of

923
00:27:25,919 --> 00:27:27,760
engineering greatness and uh

924
00:27:27,760 --> 00:27:29,360
you know in the unicorn project really

925
00:27:29,360 --> 00:27:31,279
kind of gave um

926
00:27:31,279 --> 00:27:32,880
you know flushing the details of like

927
00:27:32,880 --> 00:27:34,159
you know how they are leading the

928
00:27:34,159 --> 00:27:36,559
industry

929
00:27:36,720 --> 00:27:39,440
all right uh do you foresee a time in

930
00:27:39,440 --> 00:27:40,880
the next few decades when the

931
00:27:40,880 --> 00:27:42,640
when the more capable corporate forum

932
00:27:42,640 --> 00:27:44,799
replaces the shareholder board c-suite

933
00:27:44,799 --> 00:27:48,399
form we have today

934
00:27:48,399 --> 00:27:50,320
gosh i don't know i'm not i guess maybe

935
00:27:50,320 --> 00:27:52,000
i'm not smart enough to do that

936
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:54,320
i mean i do think that technologists

937
00:27:54,320 --> 00:27:55,679
will be

938
00:27:55,679 --> 00:27:57,120
uh you know if you look at the devil's

939
00:27:57,120 --> 00:27:58,000
enterprise community these are people

940
00:27:58,000 --> 00:27:59,760
who are being promoted at a rate

941
00:27:59,760 --> 00:28:01,840
so much higher than uh the population at

942
00:28:01,840 --> 00:28:03,520
large right and so to me it just

943
00:28:03,520 --> 00:28:06,480
is inexorable inevitable right that

944
00:28:06,480 --> 00:28:07,440
these people will be

945
00:28:07,440 --> 00:28:09,360
uh leading the most strategic important

946
00:28:09,360 --> 00:28:11,600
initiatives um and probably not just the

947
00:28:11,600 --> 00:28:12,720
technology side but you know the

948
00:28:12,720 --> 00:28:14,080
business side as well

949
00:28:14,080 --> 00:28:18,240
um so i i will uh that i do believe and

950
00:28:18,240 --> 00:28:19,679
i do think kind of in the age of digital

951
00:28:19,679 --> 00:28:21,120
disruption and so forth just like

952
00:28:21,120 --> 00:28:23,200
after enron and worldcom they need a

953
00:28:23,200 --> 00:28:24,880
financial expert on the board

954
00:28:24,880 --> 00:28:26,320
right yeah i think we're going to get to

955
00:28:26,320 --> 00:28:27,440
a point where you know you need a

956
00:28:27,440 --> 00:28:28,720
digital expert

957
00:28:28,720 --> 00:28:31,520
a technologist who actually can uh you

958
00:28:31,520 --> 00:28:32,320
know give good

959
00:28:32,320 --> 00:28:34,880
advice and opinions on you know these

960
00:28:34,880 --> 00:28:36,880
digital initiatives that are being

961
00:28:36,880 --> 00:28:38,000
put forward as you know what's going to

962
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:40,399
save the company from extinction

963
00:28:40,399 --> 00:28:42,559
all right and last one before we head

964
00:28:42,559 --> 00:28:44,640
out you're so good at this jeff

965
00:28:44,640 --> 00:28:46,240
joe thanks if he had a magic way if you

966
00:28:46,240 --> 00:28:47,520
had a magic wand how would you change

967
00:28:47,520 --> 00:28:49,039
the industry

968
00:28:49,039 --> 00:28:51,600
oh man that's really good uh i don't

969
00:28:51,600 --> 00:28:53,440
know how it is uh

970
00:28:53,440 --> 00:28:54,799
yeah i think that everyone who's leading

971
00:28:54,799 --> 00:28:56,559
a devops initiative uh gets

972
00:28:56,559 --> 00:28:59,600
credit uh uses i have the savviness

973
00:28:59,600 --> 00:29:03,039
uh and sophistication and uh to

974
00:29:03,039 --> 00:29:03,600
basically

975
00:29:03,600 --> 00:29:06,480
get the recognition that they deserve

976
00:29:06,480 --> 00:29:06,880
and

977
00:29:06,880 --> 00:29:09,360
our uh the reaction is you clearly have

978
00:29:09,360 --> 00:29:10,559
the best long-term objectives of the

979
00:29:10,559 --> 00:29:11,520
organization heart

980
00:29:11,520 --> 00:29:12,799
and here's a bigger problem that we go

981
00:29:12,799 --> 00:29:14,720
solve yes

982
00:29:14,720 --> 00:29:16,480
yes all right that's a great place oh

983
00:29:16,480 --> 00:29:17,679
and one final one are you wearing your

984
00:29:17,679 --> 00:29:18,880
unicorn socks

985
00:29:18,880 --> 00:29:22,399
i got in fact um i was

986
00:29:22,399 --> 00:29:23,840
but then i i stepped in a puddle of

987
00:29:23,840 --> 00:29:25,039
water and i had to change them and i'm

988
00:29:25,039 --> 00:29:28,399
wearing like white tube socks

989
00:29:28,960 --> 00:29:30,080
all right well unfortunately we got to

990
00:29:30,080 --> 00:29:31,919
cut it there i didn't get to my long

991
00:29:31,919 --> 00:29:33,520
list of questions but i'm glad we got

992
00:29:33,520 --> 00:29:35,039
