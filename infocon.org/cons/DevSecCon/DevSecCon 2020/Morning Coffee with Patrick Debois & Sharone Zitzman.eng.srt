1
00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:02,399
actually prepared a a batman mask

2
00:00:02,399 --> 00:00:03,439
because uh

3
00:00:03,439 --> 00:00:05,440
when you're uh speaking to a superhero

4
00:00:05,440 --> 00:00:06,720
you should probably uh

5
00:00:06,720 --> 00:00:10,160
wear your own uh superhero gear

6
00:00:10,160 --> 00:00:13,759
um patrick patrick has um

7
00:00:13,759 --> 00:00:16,960
has really uh changed the industry but i

8
00:00:16,960 --> 00:00:18,480
think the very first question

9
00:00:18,480 --> 00:00:22,080
on all of our minds uh at this hour is

10
00:00:22,080 --> 00:00:25,599
how long have you been up patrick

11
00:00:25,840 --> 00:00:29,599
um can you hear me okay yep

12
00:00:29,599 --> 00:00:33,200
okay so uh i think i got up around

13
00:00:33,200 --> 00:00:36,320
eight in the morning yesterday so uh

14
00:00:36,320 --> 00:00:39,840
that's 24 hour plus two hours around

15
00:00:39,840 --> 00:00:43,040
so going strong you can see by my eyes

16
00:00:43,040 --> 00:00:46,879
i'm getting sleepy so definitely

17
00:00:46,879 --> 00:00:50,239
but yeah yeah so make sure to make this

18
00:00:50,239 --> 00:00:52,000

19
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:55,440

22
00:01:00,079 --> 00:01:01,039
fantastic

23
00:01:01,039 --> 00:01:05,519
okay so uh plenty of work uh went into

24
00:01:05,519 --> 00:01:06,799
putting together this event it's an

25
00:01:06,799 --> 00:01:08,799
extraordinary event with amazing

26
00:01:08,799 --> 00:01:10,400
speakers from around the globe so many

27
00:01:10,400 --> 00:01:11,439
moving parts

28
00:01:11,439 --> 00:01:12,720
how do you even start pulling something

29
00:01:12,720 --> 00:01:15,119
like this together

30
00:01:15,119 --> 00:01:17,280
well it all starts with the you know in

31
00:01:17,280 --> 00:01:19,920
this case with a simple tweet

32
00:01:19,920 --> 00:01:22,640
and then somebody believes in the id

33
00:01:22,640 --> 00:01:23,040
let's

34
00:01:23,040 --> 00:01:25,680
let's do this and then more people of

35
00:01:25,680 --> 00:01:27,280
the team started believing it

36
00:01:27,280 --> 00:01:30,400
like think big let's do this and uh

37
00:01:30,400 --> 00:01:32,240
you know the more people that came on

38
00:01:32,240 --> 00:01:33,680
board uh

39
00:01:33,680 --> 00:01:35,680
you know the more it grew and the more

40
00:01:35,680 --> 00:01:36,880
the connections

41
00:01:36,880 --> 00:01:39,280
the human connections you know worked

42
00:01:39,280 --> 00:01:40,640
their magic

43
00:01:40,640 --> 00:01:43,520
pulling people in uh i'm i'm not gonna

44
00:01:43,520 --> 00:01:44,799
say it wasn't the struggle

45
00:01:44,799 --> 00:01:47,040
because you know we had to kind of find

46
00:01:47,040 --> 00:01:48,799
replacement for people

47
00:01:48,799 --> 00:01:51,119
uh in these times and kind of have

48
00:01:51,119 --> 00:01:54,479
backups for backups for backups

49
00:01:54,479 --> 00:01:57,200
but we managed right so you know there's

50
00:01:57,200 --> 00:01:58,320
no real

51
00:01:58,320 --> 00:02:01,040
exact planning although there is like

52
00:02:01,040 --> 00:02:01,920
execution

53
00:02:01,920 --> 00:02:04,159
in a way that you know you prepare for

54
00:02:04,159 --> 00:02:05,360
you know the worst

55
00:02:05,360 --> 00:02:07,840
and i think part of my alps background

56
00:02:07,840 --> 00:02:08,720
is like

57
00:02:08,720 --> 00:02:11,038
having failure modes and making sure

58
00:02:11,038 --> 00:02:13,200
that you look at the failure modes of

59
00:02:13,200 --> 00:02:15,760
whatever we're doing and you find a way

60
00:02:15,760 --> 00:02:18,160
or an alternative so that's what we did

61
00:02:18,160 --> 00:02:21,120
that's awesome um are you able or would

62
00:02:21,120 --> 00:02:23,599
you like to share the final tally of uh

63
00:02:23,599 --> 00:02:26,480
funds that were raised towards charity

64
00:02:26,480 --> 00:02:27,360
sorry

65
00:02:27,360 --> 00:02:30,319
can you repeat that i said are you able

66
00:02:30,319 --> 00:02:30,720
or

67
00:02:30,720 --> 00:02:33,200
um is it possible for you to share the

68
00:02:33,200 --> 00:02:35,200
an estimate of the final funds raised

69
00:02:35,200 --> 00:02:36,640
towards charity

70
00:02:36,640 --> 00:02:38,959
i'm going to leave that to the owner of

71
00:02:38,959 --> 00:02:40,319
the closing

72
00:02:40,319 --> 00:02:42,959
kind of not steal the thunder of the

73
00:02:42,959 --> 00:02:43,920
team

74
00:02:43,920 --> 00:02:48,080
so but you know the hint is obviously

75
00:02:48,080 --> 00:02:48,480
it's

76
00:02:48,480 --> 00:02:51,920
looking great fantastic so that

77
00:02:51,920 --> 00:02:55,200
that's kind of uh you know it it went

78
00:02:55,200 --> 00:02:58,640
way more beyond my imagination of what

79
00:02:58,640 --> 00:02:58,959
we

80
00:02:58,959 --> 00:03:02,319
could have so uh we're having like a

81
00:03:02,319 --> 00:03:03,280
slow start

82
00:03:03,280 --> 00:03:05,360
and then all of a sudden is like boom

83
00:03:05,360 --> 00:03:07,040
and just people

84
00:03:07,040 --> 00:03:08,560
started like getting tickets and

85
00:03:08,560 --> 00:03:10,239
donations and

86
00:03:10,239 --> 00:03:12,959
that was uh really amazing so that's

87
00:03:12,959 --> 00:03:14,400
fantastic

88
00:03:14,400 --> 00:03:16,239
way to go to the entire team that's

89
00:03:16,239 --> 00:03:18,800
really tremendous um so before all this

90
00:03:18,800 --> 00:03:19,440
uh

91
00:03:19,440 --> 00:03:22,640
coveted 19 madness broke out i

92
00:03:22,640 --> 00:03:24,080
had the distinct opportunity and

93
00:03:24,080 --> 00:03:25,519
pleasure to participate in the 10-year

94
00:03:25,519 --> 00:03:26,400
reunion

95
00:03:26,400 --> 00:03:28,080
celebration we can call it of devops

96
00:03:28,080 --> 00:03:29,440
days in ghent

97
00:03:29,440 --> 00:03:31,120
as one of the organizers of devopsees

98
00:03:31,120 --> 00:03:32,959
tel aviv

99
00:03:32,959 --> 00:03:34,799
tell us a little bit about how you felt

100
00:03:34,799 --> 00:03:36,080
when you saw all these dozens of

101
00:03:36,080 --> 00:03:37,519
communities come together from around

102
00:03:37,519 --> 00:03:39,440
the globe

103
00:03:39,440 --> 00:03:41,200
around a concept that you literally

104
00:03:41,200 --> 00:03:43,599
created

105
00:03:44,080 --> 00:03:47,840
it is weird just to say the least

106
00:03:47,840 --> 00:03:51,120
uh but um i think we had a

107
00:03:51,120 --> 00:03:54,400
the first day was um we call it day zero

108
00:03:54,400 --> 00:03:55,040
i guess

109
00:03:55,040 --> 00:03:56,959
was all the organizers around the world

110
00:03:56,959 --> 00:03:58,400
coming together

111
00:03:58,400 --> 00:04:00,879
so you know i think we were closing

112
00:04:00,879 --> 00:04:01,439
about

113
00:04:01,439 --> 00:04:04,640
65 events a year you know and then

114
00:04:04,640 --> 00:04:06,560
all people flew in so that was like a

115
00:04:06,560 --> 00:04:08,799
magic moment when they all get to know

116
00:04:08,799 --> 00:04:09,280
each other

117
00:04:09,280 --> 00:04:11,439
get to see each other and you started

118
00:04:11,439 --> 00:04:13,840
feeling the kind of the vibe of you know

119
00:04:13,840 --> 00:04:14,239
this

120
00:04:14,239 --> 00:04:16,798
this community and then all the the

121
00:04:16,798 --> 00:04:18,079
attendees

122
00:04:18,079 --> 00:04:20,560
like i was back in my hometown in kent

123
00:04:20,560 --> 00:04:21,440
and then

124
00:04:21,440 --> 00:04:24,000
it was like at a place like where like

125
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:24,720
oh

126
00:04:24,720 --> 00:04:26,560
this would be awesome like you know an

127
00:04:26,560 --> 00:04:28,160
old theater

128
00:04:28,160 --> 00:04:30,960
and uh yeah the fact that there's like i

129
00:04:30,960 --> 00:04:32,639
was looking in the audience like i know

130
00:04:32,639 --> 00:04:34,160
that person i know that person i know

131
00:04:34,160 --> 00:04:35,919
his story i know her story

132
00:04:35,919 --> 00:04:38,479
and and a lot of it were just like

133
00:04:38,479 --> 00:04:40,840
amazing stories that i've seen over the

134
00:04:40,840 --> 00:04:42,240
years

135
00:04:42,240 --> 00:04:44,479
of people growing in the community

136
00:04:44,479 --> 00:04:46,000
helping others

137
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:47,840
uh you know when they grow they they

138
00:04:47,840 --> 00:04:49,600
started like helping others and it just

139
00:04:49,600 --> 00:04:50,080
like

140
00:04:50,080 --> 00:04:52,240
is this chain reaction of things

141
00:04:52,240 --> 00:04:53,919
happening and it's like

142
00:04:53,919 --> 00:04:57,840
it's like super unrealistic in a way

143
00:04:57,840 --> 00:05:00,800
that this is happening but this is like

144
00:05:00,800 --> 00:05:01,680
a

145
00:05:01,680 --> 00:05:04,000
privilege to witness uh you know people

146
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:05,039
you know do that

147
00:05:05,039 --> 00:05:08,080
uh so that yeah it was heartwarming

148
00:05:08,080 --> 00:05:10,639
yeah i can tell you that for me um i've

149
00:05:10,639 --> 00:05:12,560
been in this since 2013

150
00:05:12,560 --> 00:05:14,960
and i hadn't i mean aside from the those

151
00:05:14,960 --> 00:05:16,720
who came to the tel aviv event i never

152
00:05:16,720 --> 00:05:18,880
had the opportunity of really meeting uh

153
00:05:18,880 --> 00:05:20,560
all the organizers and it was just such

154
00:05:20,560 --> 00:05:21,919
a wonderful experience to

155
00:05:21,919 --> 00:05:23,520
to be a part of something that's greater

156
00:05:23,520 --> 00:05:25,520
than yourself so

157
00:05:25,520 --> 00:05:28,240
on that very note um what's it like to

158
00:05:28,240 --> 00:05:29,520
know that you coined a phrase that

159
00:05:29,520 --> 00:05:31,039
spurred an entire movement

160
00:05:31,039 --> 00:05:32,880
around like a complete transformation of

161
00:05:32,880 --> 00:05:35,280
an industry i think that's a really big

162
00:05:35,280 --> 00:05:37,520
achievement

163
00:05:37,520 --> 00:05:41,199
so um let me phrase it like this

164
00:05:41,199 --> 00:05:44,000
my my son who would say like daddy why

165
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:45,840
didn't you trademark devops and

166
00:05:45,840 --> 00:05:48,960
it's like it kind of you know whatever

167
00:05:48,960 --> 00:05:49,840
you do

168
00:05:49,840 --> 00:05:52,479
a family puts things in perspective and

169
00:05:52,479 --> 00:05:54,479
uh like there was never a plan

170
00:05:54,479 --> 00:05:56,880
and the fact that this has grown it's

171
00:05:56,880 --> 00:05:57,520
it's

172
00:05:57,520 --> 00:05:59,759
it's given me a lot of opportunities and

173
00:05:59,759 --> 00:06:00,880
a lot of you know

174
00:06:00,880 --> 00:06:04,080
people i talked to and things that i

175
00:06:04,080 --> 00:06:06,560
you know witnessed and and and

176
00:06:06,560 --> 00:06:08,479
especially things that i learned

177
00:06:08,479 --> 00:06:11,840
um i think a lot of people will

178
00:06:11,840 --> 00:06:14,479
like would try to put me somewhere in

179
00:06:14,479 --> 00:06:16,400
the center but i keep saying it's it's

180
00:06:16,400 --> 00:06:16,720
like

181
00:06:16,720 --> 00:06:18,479
something that happened over time it's

182
00:06:18,479 --> 00:06:19,759
it's like the

183
00:06:19,759 --> 00:06:22,720
like the industry was ripe for new ideas

184
00:06:22,720 --> 00:06:23,199
and

185
00:06:23,199 --> 00:06:26,639
um and that was just like i keep saying

186
00:06:26,639 --> 00:06:27,440
it's it's

187
00:06:27,440 --> 00:06:30,720
it's by accident that we got started so

188
00:06:30,720 --> 00:06:32,639
it wasn't something that came out of my

189
00:06:32,639 --> 00:06:34,960
brain it's just like

190
00:06:34,960 --> 00:06:38,160
different threads that cross parts what

191
00:06:38,160 --> 00:06:40,479
i usually say is that i do

192
00:06:40,479 --> 00:06:42,800
like give myself the credit that i i

193
00:06:42,800 --> 00:06:44,080
promoted a lot of it

194
00:06:44,080 --> 00:06:46,000
so it's not that i thought about it but

195
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:47,199
the fact that

196
00:06:47,199 --> 00:06:50,479
that kind of energy cut things rolling

197
00:06:50,479 --> 00:06:51,680
and i think one of the nicest

198
00:06:51,680 --> 00:06:54,080
compliments i got is that

199
00:06:54,080 --> 00:06:56,639
somebody said part of the openness and

200
00:06:56,639 --> 00:06:58,080
the willingness of the

201
00:06:58,080 --> 00:07:01,120
devops community

202
00:07:01,120 --> 00:07:04,720
is a reflection from um kind of my

203
00:07:04,720 --> 00:07:05,759
character

204
00:07:05,759 --> 00:07:07,599
and and and that's like one of the

205
00:07:07,599 --> 00:07:09,680
hugest compliments i could get

206
00:07:09,680 --> 00:07:12,160
and then people sending me emails are

207
00:07:12,160 --> 00:07:13,039
coming up to me

208
00:07:13,039 --> 00:07:15,199
like you changed my life you changed my

209
00:07:15,199 --> 00:07:16,720
things for the better

210
00:07:16,720 --> 00:07:20,000
that is like so rewarding i i can't even

211
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:22,000
describe that so

212
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:24,800
it's amazing they say that the highest

213
00:07:24,800 --> 00:07:26,479
form of flattery is uh

214
00:07:26,479 --> 00:07:28,000
is when somebody like mimics doing so

215
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:30,319
the cncf only just recently 10 years

216
00:07:30,319 --> 00:07:32,319
after you launched devops days

217
00:07:32,319 --> 00:07:35,360
uh is now trying to replicate that for

218
00:07:35,360 --> 00:07:37,520
uh kubernetes and their kubernetes

219
00:07:37,520 --> 00:07:39,199
community um

220
00:07:39,199 --> 00:07:41,440
do you think these grassroots style of

221
00:07:41,440 --> 00:07:42,560
events well i know now that

222
00:07:42,560 --> 00:07:45,120
we're in you know covet 19 and it's a

223
00:07:45,120 --> 00:07:46,000
little bit different

224
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:48,319
um but do you think that that's going to

225
00:07:48,319 --> 00:07:49,599
be the new face of how

226
00:07:49,599 --> 00:07:51,199
you know technology events happen not

227
00:07:51,199 --> 00:07:52,639
those like large-scale

228
00:07:52,639 --> 00:07:54,000
kind of industry events but more like

229
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:57,199
grassroots developer type events

230
00:07:57,199 --> 00:07:59,280
so what's interesting is the way that

231
00:07:59,280 --> 00:08:00,479
the initial years of

232
00:08:00,479 --> 00:08:03,759
organizing develops days event was

233
00:08:03,759 --> 00:08:05,440
actually getting

234
00:08:05,440 --> 00:08:07,199
kind of random people on twitter not

235
00:08:07,199 --> 00:08:09,120
really random because you you can see

236
00:08:09,120 --> 00:08:11,199
them from afar from their communication

237
00:08:11,199 --> 00:08:12,560
what they're interested in

238
00:08:12,560 --> 00:08:15,520
like the way they their language works

239
00:08:15,520 --> 00:08:15,840
and

240
00:08:15,840 --> 00:08:18,319
i never met those people and yet i was

241
00:08:18,319 --> 00:08:19,360
able to say

242
00:08:19,360 --> 00:08:21,280
let's do a conference in new york let's

243
00:08:21,280 --> 00:08:23,919
do one in israel let's do one there

244
00:08:23,919 --> 00:08:27,120
and and that was like i never met them

245
00:08:27,120 --> 00:08:30,639
but so the fact that we i i i wasn't

246
00:08:30,639 --> 00:08:31,280
like

247
00:08:31,280 --> 00:08:34,080
having day-to-day meeting them in person

248
00:08:34,080 --> 00:08:35,440
was kind of irrelevant

249
00:08:35,440 --> 00:08:37,120
in that perspective and then and you

250
00:08:37,120 --> 00:08:38,719
know people hang out

251
00:08:38,719 --> 00:08:42,080
on slack or chat and like

252
00:08:42,080 --> 00:08:45,440
creating the github web repository or

253
00:08:45,440 --> 00:08:48,560
like describing documents and

254
00:08:48,560 --> 00:08:51,839
i think it's it

255
00:08:51,839 --> 00:08:54,240
i think now we would appreciate it more

256
00:08:54,240 --> 00:08:54,880
more

257
00:08:54,880 --> 00:08:58,480
and it feel less erratic when

258
00:08:58,480 --> 00:09:00,560
i i would reach out to a random person

259
00:09:00,560 --> 00:09:02,640
saying hey let's do a conferences like

260
00:09:02,640 --> 00:09:04,240
what

261
00:09:04,240 --> 00:09:06,800
but but now they they would kind of be

262
00:09:06,800 --> 00:09:09,920
more open that like a remote person

263
00:09:09,920 --> 00:09:12,000
uh you know is just a regular person

264
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:12,959
that would listen to

265
00:09:12,959 --> 00:09:14,880
instead of just being a person from

266
00:09:14,880 --> 00:09:16,399
their inner circle or

267
00:09:16,399 --> 00:09:18,480
the people that they used to hang out so

268
00:09:18,480 --> 00:09:21,600
in that way i i think it's a positive

269
00:09:21,600 --> 00:09:24,560
movement that it opens things up uh

270
00:09:24,560 --> 00:09:27,200
frequent for bad like

271
00:09:27,200 --> 00:09:29,360
the number of zoom calls and remote

272
00:09:29,360 --> 00:09:31,120
conferences we're doing is obviously

273
00:09:31,120 --> 00:09:31,920
increasing

274
00:09:31,920 --> 00:09:34,959
so but but that's just uh yeah something

275
00:09:34,959 --> 00:09:37,839
else

276
00:09:38,480 --> 00:09:40,640
i like that well we scale i think mike

277
00:09:40,640 --> 00:09:42,210
is so busy on us right

278
00:09:42,210 --> 00:09:45,279
[Laughter]

279
00:09:45,279 --> 00:09:48,560
we want to see how long you can hold up

280
00:09:48,560 --> 00:09:52,080
well yeah it's like it can break my

281
00:09:52,080 --> 00:09:52,560
record

282
00:09:52,560 --> 00:09:56,719
i have no problem you can do that

283
00:09:57,120 --> 00:10:01,279
all right the fun fact of the uh 2399

284
00:10:01,279 --> 00:10:04,720
is that uh so initially it was kind of

285
00:10:04,720 --> 00:10:06,000
like a

286
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:08,720
running joke for the marathon i think

287
00:10:08,720 --> 00:10:09,920
there was like uh

288
00:10:09,920 --> 00:10:11,920
the marathon would that was gonna be

289
00:10:11,920 --> 00:10:13,120
held like virtually

290
00:10:13,120 --> 00:10:15,360
and they they put like uh i i don't know

291
00:10:15,360 --> 00:10:17,040
what it's like 24 hours

292
00:10:17,040 --> 00:10:20,320
or something um and then like people

293
00:10:20,320 --> 00:10:23,600
started speculating what's the 0.99 for

294
00:10:23,600 --> 00:10:27,120
is it like a rounding error is it like

295
00:10:27,120 --> 00:10:29,680
like a lot of like different twists uh i

296
00:10:29,680 --> 00:10:31,040
think reality now

297
00:10:31,040 --> 00:10:34,240
like close to having the 24 hours uh

298
00:10:34,240 --> 00:10:37,519
we actually went down that like dot

299
00:10:37,519 --> 00:10:40,880
uh 0.001

300
00:10:40,880 --> 00:10:43,040
of the conference nobody noticed it but

301
00:10:43,040 --> 00:10:44,959
it was one stream that kicked in

302
00:10:44,959 --> 00:10:48,160
i closed the stream unexpected error

303
00:10:48,160 --> 00:10:50,240
i just hit the button again and there we

304
00:10:50,240 --> 00:10:52,560
were rolling again so

305
00:10:52,560 --> 00:10:53,760
i have to say this was like an

306
00:10:53,760 --> 00:10:56,160
operational it's like amazing

307
00:10:56,160 --> 00:10:57,920
um all right i'm gonna ask a bit of a

308
00:10:57,920 --> 00:11:00,160
controversial question uh

309
00:11:00,160 --> 00:11:02,560
so you've been pretty vocal about your

310
00:11:02,560 --> 00:11:06,640
opinion on devsecops

311
00:11:07,200 --> 00:11:09,279
what's next for devops uh some would

312
00:11:09,279 --> 00:11:11,440
already say that devops as a concept is

313
00:11:11,440 --> 00:11:13,279
becoming legacy

314
00:11:13,279 --> 00:11:14,800
where is it all going some say that

315
00:11:14,800 --> 00:11:16,880
there's overlap between devops sre

316
00:11:16,880 --> 00:11:18,399
production engineering platform

317
00:11:18,399 --> 00:11:19,519
engineering et cetera et cetera et

318
00:11:19,519 --> 00:11:20,959
cetera

319
00:11:20,959 --> 00:11:22,800
looking ahead where do you see all this

320
00:11:22,800 --> 00:11:25,199
going

321
00:11:25,600 --> 00:11:30,160
yeah it's i think it's a question i

322
00:11:30,160 --> 00:11:31,839
kind of get a lot like what's the future

323
00:11:31,839 --> 00:11:33,200
of devops and i

324
00:11:33,200 --> 00:11:36,480
i kind of taken my piece in a way that i

325
00:11:36,480 --> 00:11:38,800
i don't care about it too much and when

326
00:11:38,800 --> 00:11:41,279
you say devops has become like a legacy

327
00:11:41,279 --> 00:11:44,720
i would say it's become more embedded

328
00:11:44,720 --> 00:11:46,720
the way of thinking so it's a you know

329
00:11:46,720 --> 00:11:48,560
it's a different way of like rephrasing

330
00:11:48,560 --> 00:11:49,519
the same thing or

331
00:11:49,519 --> 00:11:52,639
um and

332
00:11:52,639 --> 00:11:56,480
there will be a like in a new phrase or

333
00:11:56,480 --> 00:11:58,320
something new you know we've seen now

334
00:11:58,320 --> 00:12:00,720
sre and then observability

335
00:12:00,720 --> 00:12:03,360
and then serverless and and then you

336
00:12:03,360 --> 00:12:04,880
know many trends

337
00:12:04,880 --> 00:12:08,160
i think there's it's been gonna be some

338
00:12:08,160 --> 00:12:08,480
time

339
00:12:08,480 --> 00:12:11,519
until we see like a new human trend

340
00:12:11,519 --> 00:12:13,760
you know i think resilience is kind of

341
00:12:13,760 --> 00:12:16,720
going that direction

342
00:12:16,720 --> 00:12:20,000
but i would hope somehow that we again

343
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:22,839
kind of get closer to the agile people

344
00:12:22,839 --> 00:12:24,079
again uh

345
00:12:24,079 --> 00:12:26,480
which you know if you track the two

346
00:12:26,480 --> 00:12:27,680
groups

347
00:12:27,680 --> 00:12:29,839
uh separately like the let's say the

348
00:12:29,839 --> 00:12:32,320
devops or and the ops community

349
00:12:32,320 --> 00:12:35,279
and then the idle community they're kind

350
00:12:35,279 --> 00:12:37,120
of talking about the same things but

351
00:12:37,120 --> 00:12:39,120
they're going at different conferences

352
00:12:39,120 --> 00:12:40,160
there's you know

353
00:12:40,160 --> 00:12:43,440
speaking of like different models

354
00:12:43,440 --> 00:12:46,240
uh and i would hope to you know that

355
00:12:46,240 --> 00:12:48,800
that comes closer again together

356
00:12:48,800 --> 00:12:51,519
uh but besides that you're like i

357
00:12:51,519 --> 00:12:52,000
learned that

358
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:54,079
you you cannot predict where things are

359
00:12:54,079 --> 00:12:55,360
going and i

360
00:12:55,360 --> 00:12:58,240
i'm i have like lots of gray hair so i

361
00:12:58,240 --> 00:12:59,360
live through agile

362
00:12:59,360 --> 00:13:03,200
i live to itil and like

363
00:13:03,200 --> 00:13:05,440
they all start with the you know good

364
00:13:05,440 --> 00:13:06,320
intentions

365
00:13:06,320 --> 00:13:09,440
people really like uh

366
00:13:09,440 --> 00:13:12,160
working on it and improving things and

367
00:13:12,160 --> 00:13:13,760
then somehow it gets

368
00:13:13,760 --> 00:13:17,360
lost uh in a in like a wider majority

369
00:13:17,360 --> 00:13:19,600
and i think that's happening with kind

370
00:13:19,600 --> 00:13:20,959
of devops in general

371
00:13:20,959 --> 00:13:23,600
right oh it was like cool the new thing

372
00:13:23,600 --> 00:13:24,480
we tried it

373
00:13:24,480 --> 00:13:26,800
the work so we're looking for the next

374
00:13:26,800 --> 00:13:27,760
thing

375
00:13:27,760 --> 00:13:31,279
and um i once gave a presentation

376
00:13:31,279 --> 00:13:34,240
that where i said like devops is like a

377
00:13:34,240 --> 00:13:35,120
meme

378
00:13:35,120 --> 00:13:37,600
so it will just keep repeating and it

379
00:13:37,600 --> 00:13:38,160
will

380
00:13:38,160 --> 00:13:40,959
like meme is actually uh the smallest

381
00:13:40,959 --> 00:13:41,440
unit

382
00:13:41,440 --> 00:13:44,560
from a cultural

383
00:13:44,560 --> 00:13:48,000
uh thing so a meme devops as a meme will

384
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:51,279
just keep being there forever uh where

385
00:13:51,279 --> 00:13:52,959
that's gonna be like

386
00:13:52,959 --> 00:13:54,959
continuously talked about or somewhere

387
00:13:54,959 --> 00:13:56,800
in the corner it doesn't really matter

388
00:13:56,800 --> 00:13:57,440
but it

389
00:13:57,440 --> 00:14:00,079
like people will build ideas on top of

390
00:14:00,079 --> 00:14:00,480
that

391
00:14:00,480 --> 00:14:03,120
and that way like i i take in my piece

392
00:14:03,120 --> 00:14:05,040
or whatever it will come so

393
00:14:05,040 --> 00:14:07,279
and anyway i never control it i will

394
00:14:07,279 --> 00:14:08,240
never will

395
00:14:08,240 --> 00:14:11,120
and i never want to so you know the more

396
00:14:11,120 --> 00:14:12,160
ideas they're coming

397
00:14:12,160 --> 00:14:14,079
the better because then you know we can

398
00:14:14,079 --> 00:14:15,760
expand and learn new things

399
00:14:15,760 --> 00:14:19,199
that's important for me so uh a question

400
00:14:19,199 --> 00:14:21,600
that i have a personal question uh now

401
00:14:21,600 --> 00:14:23,760
that i have you live and you have to

402
00:14:23,760 --> 00:14:27,120
when are we getting you to tel aviv

403
00:14:27,150 --> 00:14:29,199
[Laughter]

404
00:14:29,199 --> 00:14:31,440
i've been there but not long enough so

405
00:14:31,440 --> 00:14:32,639
i've been there in the beginning of the

406
00:14:32,639 --> 00:14:33,519
year

407
00:14:33,519 --> 00:14:36,480
i like uh i mean for devops today no but

408
00:14:36,480 --> 00:14:38,399
it was pleasantly surprised so

409
00:14:38,399 --> 00:14:40,560
you know if that opportunity comes again

410
00:14:40,560 --> 00:14:42,959
i'll definitely come over sharon so

411
00:14:42,959 --> 00:14:44,240
appreciate all the work you're doing

412
00:14:44,240 --> 00:14:46,959
there i don't know of course um

413
00:14:46,959 --> 00:14:48,880
do you have a github repo for do

414
00:14:48,880 --> 00:14:51,600
yourself online conferencing

415
00:14:51,600 --> 00:14:54,560
uh i do but it's private i will clean it

416
00:14:54,560 --> 00:14:56,800
up but not today

417
00:14:56,800 --> 00:14:59,760
but it's basically crappy html and css i

418
00:14:59,760 --> 00:15:01,360
threw it together in the last couple of

419
00:15:01,360 --> 00:15:02,160
days

420
00:15:02,160 --> 00:15:04,399
uh and then for the rest i lose a lot of

421
00:15:04,399 --> 00:15:05,360
services but

422
00:15:05,360 --> 00:15:07,360
i think the trick was like choosing the

423
00:15:07,360 --> 00:15:08,800
right services

424
00:15:08,800 --> 00:15:12,399
uh in a way that they were compatible

425
00:15:12,399 --> 00:15:14,639
simple enough to operate by all the

426
00:15:14,639 --> 00:15:15,920
people um

427
00:15:15,920 --> 00:15:18,000
and that so i'll i'll be working and

428
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:19,519
sharing that because that was part of

429
00:15:19,519 --> 00:15:21,600
the exercise

430
00:15:21,600 --> 00:15:25,199
we could have gone for a full-fledged

431
00:15:25,199 --> 00:15:28,240
platform which would have cost us

432
00:15:28,240 --> 00:15:30,800
quite some money uh and given that it's

433
00:15:30,800 --> 00:15:32,000
community we just like

434
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:34,560
wanted to give that back to you know the

435
00:15:34,560 --> 00:15:35,360
charity

436
00:15:35,360 --> 00:15:38,160
yeah uh and no offense but a lot of the

437
00:15:38,160 --> 00:15:38,720
platform

438
00:15:38,720 --> 00:15:40,399
just looked like they were built in the

439
00:15:40,399 --> 00:15:41,920
80s

440
00:15:41,920 --> 00:15:45,279
and they're like they're like this kind

441
00:15:45,279 --> 00:15:48,320
of transformation of

442
00:15:48,320 --> 00:15:51,519
a local you know booth to

443
00:15:51,519 --> 00:15:54,079
like a virtual booth in 3d and i'm i'm

444
00:15:54,079 --> 00:15:56,079
not a big fan of those concepts so

445
00:15:56,079 --> 00:15:58,079
you know i like simplicity and even

446
00:15:58,079 --> 00:15:59,440
though it didn't achieve all the

447
00:15:59,440 --> 00:16:00,880
interactivity that i

448
00:16:00,880 --> 00:16:03,360
like i was hoping or aiming for we had

449
00:16:03,360 --> 00:16:04,320
to cut down

450
00:16:04,320 --> 00:16:06,399
you know a lot of the options but we did

451
00:16:06,399 --> 00:16:08,399
quite some experiments so i i'm happy

452
00:16:08,399 --> 00:16:09,759
about that how that went

453
00:16:09,759 --> 00:16:11,199
yeah i think the internet that's like

454
00:16:11,199 --> 00:16:13,360
the long answer to say yes it will be

455
00:16:13,360 --> 00:16:13,920
available

456
00:16:13,920 --> 00:16:17,600
so um okay so you did say that you have

457
00:16:17,600 --> 00:16:18,800
uh the gray hair

458
00:16:18,800 --> 00:16:21,120
and gray hair uh is obviously a sign of

459
00:16:21,120 --> 00:16:23,199
many years of experience

460
00:16:23,199 --> 00:16:25,279
avishai shalom one of my community

461
00:16:25,279 --> 00:16:26,880
favorites from our area

462
00:16:26,880 --> 00:16:29,120
likes to say that real expertise takes

463
00:16:29,120 --> 00:16:31,199
about 20 years to cultivate

464
00:16:31,199 --> 00:16:33,440
so as someone who i would consider an

465
00:16:33,440 --> 00:16:34,959
expert in this area

466
00:16:34,959 --> 00:16:37,600
give us a few tips uh you know your

467
00:16:37,600 --> 00:16:38,880
takeaways from the

468
00:16:38,880 --> 00:16:40,560
years that you've been in the industry

469
00:16:40,560 --> 00:16:42,240
um the most important achievements the

470
00:16:42,240 --> 00:16:43,279
devops uh

471
00:16:43,279 --> 00:16:47,440
accomplishments has been possible

472
00:16:47,440 --> 00:16:48,880
so i think the most important

473
00:16:48,880 --> 00:16:50,880
achievement is the fact that

474
00:16:50,880 --> 00:16:53,839
we we brought the groups together and

475
00:16:53,839 --> 00:16:55,519
then

476
00:16:55,519 --> 00:16:57,680
like agile kind of brought the devs and

477
00:16:57,680 --> 00:16:59,279
the testers closer together in the

478
00:16:59,279 --> 00:17:00,160
business but

479
00:17:00,160 --> 00:17:02,639
the bringing the ops and now i think the

480
00:17:02,639 --> 00:17:04,720
devsecops is an extension of that

481
00:17:04,720 --> 00:17:07,199
that the fact that this collaboration is

482
00:17:07,199 --> 00:17:09,679
happening on the on a human level

483
00:17:09,679 --> 00:17:12,079
uh for me that's that is still the

484
00:17:12,079 --> 00:17:14,640
important part of of devops and i know a

485
00:17:14,640 --> 00:17:16,640
lot of people see it in the pipeline but

486
00:17:16,640 --> 00:17:18,240
the fact that

487
00:17:18,240 --> 00:17:21,199
i i can have like a normal day-to-day

488
00:17:21,199 --> 00:17:22,000
conversation

489
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:24,880
without having you know overly stressed

490
00:17:24,880 --> 00:17:25,280
and

491
00:17:25,280 --> 00:17:29,919
doing a good job uh you know i

492
00:17:29,919 --> 00:17:31,520
some would say it's just an extension of

493
00:17:31,520 --> 00:17:33,360
agile and they're right so

494
00:17:33,360 --> 00:17:35,760
it took like a new term to kind of you

495
00:17:35,760 --> 00:17:37,200
know get some minds

496
00:17:37,200 --> 00:17:40,240
in a new direction which is fine uh

497
00:17:40,240 --> 00:17:42,960
but i like the fact that it's and

498
00:17:42,960 --> 00:17:43,679
hopefully

499
00:17:43,679 --> 00:17:46,000
it kind of humanized a little bit of the

500
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:48,480
discussions that were happening in

501
00:17:48,480 --> 00:17:51,760
kind of companies i could obviously give

502
00:17:51,760 --> 00:17:53,840
the polite answer and say you know we

503
00:17:53,840 --> 00:17:56,960
got better for the business but i may

504
00:17:56,960 --> 00:17:59,120
not be that business person i

505
00:17:59,120 --> 00:18:01,679
may like be closer to the human person

506
00:18:01,679 --> 00:18:04,160
than the fact that people are

507
00:18:04,160 --> 00:18:06,400
having a better life at their jobs

508
00:18:06,400 --> 00:18:08,240
they're like working well together

509
00:18:08,240 --> 00:18:10,960
they have less stress uh for me that is

510
00:18:10,960 --> 00:18:11,520
like a

511
00:18:11,520 --> 00:18:14,559
you know a more important part of of the

512
00:18:14,559 --> 00:18:17,200
achievement i guess

513
00:18:17,200 --> 00:18:19,440
um that's amazing i really do think that

514
00:18:19,440 --> 00:18:20,320
um

515
00:18:20,320 --> 00:18:22,960
the whole devops concept uh brought the

516
00:18:22,960 --> 00:18:24,799
human element into it made people

517
00:18:24,799 --> 00:18:26,000
understand

518
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:27,600
about a little bit more about the people

519
00:18:27,600 --> 00:18:29,280
behind these roles and i think that

520
00:18:29,280 --> 00:18:31,280
that's a great achievement of yours

521
00:18:31,280 --> 00:18:33,440
um one last uh question from the crowd

522
00:18:33,440 --> 00:18:35,120
um in your do-it-yourself

523
00:18:35,120 --> 00:18:37,840
kind of open conference uh uh github

524
00:18:37,840 --> 00:18:38,960
repo that you're gonna share is there

525
00:18:38,960 --> 00:18:39,360
any

526
00:18:39,360 --> 00:18:40,880
recommended hardware or anything that

527
00:18:40,880 --> 00:18:42,559
you would recommend for people to use in

528
00:18:42,559 --> 00:18:45,360
order to get started

529
00:18:45,440 --> 00:18:47,840
so i i can like quickly say what we use

530
00:18:47,840 --> 00:18:48,640
here so

531
00:18:48,640 --> 00:18:53,360
that like for further reference we used

532
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:56,000
stream yard which is a kind of easy

533
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:57,840
streaming solution

534
00:18:57,840 --> 00:19:01,280
for streaming a room um

535
00:19:01,280 --> 00:19:03,200
much like hangouts but a little bit more

536
00:19:03,200 --> 00:19:04,320
fancier like you see

537
00:19:04,320 --> 00:19:05,840
you know all the scrolling titles the

538
00:19:05,840 --> 00:19:07,600
logos and stuff

539
00:19:07,600 --> 00:19:09,200
i think the reason why we chose it was

540
00:19:09,200 --> 00:19:12,080
it because it was easy to operate

541
00:19:12,080 --> 00:19:13,919
then we had a backup streaming system

542
00:19:13,919 --> 00:19:16,160
called go live stream

543
00:19:16,160 --> 00:19:18,160
and that the reason why is that you know

544
00:19:18,160 --> 00:19:19,600
if this

545
00:19:19,600 --> 00:19:21,280
streamer didn't work we could still like

546
00:19:21,280 --> 00:19:23,360
switch to zoom as a backup plan

547
00:19:23,360 --> 00:19:25,520
if the stream failed we could like you

548
00:19:25,520 --> 00:19:27,200
know keep the stream running

549
00:19:27,200 --> 00:19:29,360
if youtube failed and we could go to

550
00:19:29,360 --> 00:19:30,240
mixer so

551
00:19:30,240 --> 00:19:33,120
it like provided a lot of backup options

552
00:19:33,120 --> 00:19:34,559
for doing that

553
00:19:34,559 --> 00:19:36,400
uh i want to give a shout out to

554
00:19:36,400 --> 00:19:38,080
sessioneyes which is the tool

555
00:19:38,080 --> 00:19:41,600
that like we used for putting the whole

556
00:19:41,600 --> 00:19:44,400
uh planning of the schedule which they

557
00:19:44,400 --> 00:19:44,720
like

558
00:19:44,720 --> 00:19:46,559
donated because we're doing this for a

559
00:19:46,559 --> 00:19:50,080
good cause so that was cool

560
00:19:50,080 --> 00:19:53,840
what did i forget uh so the streaming

561
00:19:53,840 --> 00:19:55,200
that was on mixer

562
00:19:55,200 --> 00:19:57,440
and we chose mixer because it has like

563
00:19:57,440 --> 00:19:58,559
only a couple of

564
00:19:58,559 --> 00:20:01,440
seconds of latency which is cool for

565
00:20:01,440 --> 00:20:03,120
doing interactions

566
00:20:03,120 --> 00:20:05,120
uh and otherwise you know you'll have to

567
00:20:05,120 --> 00:20:07,679
wait like 10 or 15 seconds until

568
00:20:07,679 --> 00:20:09,200
you see something happening on stream

569
00:20:09,200 --> 00:20:10,880
while you're already done it which is

570
00:20:10,880 --> 00:20:12,240
awkward for a presenter

571
00:20:12,240 --> 00:20:15,360
so that's like one of the reasons why we

572
00:20:15,360 --> 00:20:17,918
chose that

573
00:20:18,799 --> 00:20:21,919
what else i think that uh

574
00:20:21,919 --> 00:20:24,320
it's there aren't that many moving parts

575
00:20:24,320 --> 00:20:25,760
that we used

576
00:20:25,760 --> 00:20:27,600
but the fact that it you know there's so

577
00:20:27,600 --> 00:20:29,760
many options out there

578
00:20:29,760 --> 00:20:32,320
and then choosing wisely depending on

579
00:20:32,320 --> 00:20:34,400
the options depending on the costs

580
00:20:34,400 --> 00:20:37,120
that was kind of our choice uh where we

581
00:20:37,120 --> 00:20:38,320
went for so

582
00:20:38,320 --> 00:20:41,679
that's in a nutshell wow so

583
00:20:41,679 --> 00:20:44,240
yeah as uh you can tell that an

584
00:20:44,240 --> 00:20:46,159
operations person said

585
00:20:46,159 --> 00:20:48,080
redundancy and more redundancy and more

586
00:20:48,080 --> 00:20:49,360
than see that's really cool

587
00:20:49,360 --> 00:20:52,240
yeah we did use it live so somebody

588
00:20:52,240 --> 00:20:52,720
couldn't

589
00:20:52,720 --> 00:20:54,960
go on a tool so we switched to zoom

590
00:20:54,960 --> 00:20:55,919
patch them in

591
00:20:55,919 --> 00:20:58,799
so you know we had that covered uh you

592
00:20:58,799 --> 00:21:00,159
know the things happen

593
00:21:00,159 --> 00:21:02,720
and a live stream is all like predicting

594
00:21:02,720 --> 00:21:03,919
like what's gonna happen

595
00:21:03,919 --> 00:21:07,919
so um so i think we're coming to the

596
00:21:07,919 --> 00:21:09,360
tail end of this awesome

597
00:21:09,360 --> 00:21:11,440
ama uh for me it was a pleasure and an

598
00:21:11,440 --> 00:21:12,720
honor to be able to do this

599
00:21:12,720 --> 00:21:16,159
uh to participate in all the talks um

600
00:21:16,159 --> 00:21:18,080
i think i take this opportunity to wrap

601
00:21:18,080 --> 00:21:21,520
it up and say a few thoughts uh

602
00:21:21,840 --> 00:21:25,039
you'd like yeah i think it's um

603
00:21:25,039 --> 00:21:28,080
it was a an amazing team and you know

604
00:21:28,080 --> 00:21:31,600
you have to stay up for 24 hours but

605
00:21:31,600 --> 00:21:33,600
you know the the fun the jokes

606
00:21:33,600 --> 00:21:36,240
everything happening on the on the slack

607
00:21:36,240 --> 00:21:39,200
uh just people were so open a big shout

608
00:21:39,200 --> 00:21:41,280
out for the people in the green room

609
00:21:41,280 --> 00:21:43,200
uh you know that wasn't visible for a

610
00:21:43,200 --> 00:21:44,400
lot of the folks

611
00:21:44,400 --> 00:21:47,039
obviously the presenters uh there as

612
00:21:47,039 --> 00:21:47,440
well

613
00:21:47,440 --> 00:21:48,799
you know the people in the company

614
00:21:48,799 --> 00:21:50,400
supporting it with their volunteering

615
00:21:50,400 --> 00:21:51,200
time

616
00:21:51,200 --> 00:21:54,000
uh the sponsors who kicked in like quite

617
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:54,880
like uh

618
00:21:54,880 --> 00:21:57,440
generously you know for a handful of

619
00:21:57,440 --> 00:21:58,720
showing on the screen

620
00:21:58,720 --> 00:22:00,880
they all kicked like some money in uh

621
00:22:00,880 --> 00:22:02,320
was amazing

622
00:22:02,320 --> 00:22:04,799
uh and then the audience that was there

623
00:22:04,799 --> 00:22:06,799
uh that was like also a surprise

624
00:22:06,799 --> 00:22:11,360
uh i think we got close to 880

625
00:22:11,360 --> 00:22:14,320
people watching simultaneously which is

626
00:22:14,320 --> 00:22:16,240
kind of insane you know if you look that

627
00:22:16,240 --> 00:22:18,159
across 24 hours

628
00:22:18,159 --> 00:22:20,640
so that was like beyond my expectations

629
00:22:20,640 --> 00:22:22,480
of an event so you know

630
00:22:22,480 --> 00:22:25,039

00:23:18,080 --> 00:23:21,120
everybody gets to write stream okay so

655
00:23:21,120 --> 00:23:23,600
it's all going to be in the same stream

656
00:23:23,600 --> 00:23:24,400
no no so

657
00:23:24,400 --> 00:23:26,080
somebody's going to do the closing

659
00:23:28,080 --> 00:23:30,159
