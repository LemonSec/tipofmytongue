1
00:00:00,399 --> 00:00:02,320
hi welcome back after the break to all

2
00:00:02,320 --> 00:00:03,679
the talks

3
00:00:03,679 --> 00:00:07,680
online uh next up is casey rosenthal

4
00:00:07,680 --> 00:00:09,760
who's going to speak about continuous

5
00:00:09,760 --> 00:00:10,960
verification

6
00:00:10,960 --> 00:00:13,920
and the midst of reliability i'm very

7
00:00:13,920 --> 00:00:15,360
interested to uh

8
00:00:15,360 --> 00:00:17,279
to hear your talk casey because i've

9
00:00:17,279 --> 00:00:19,920
heard about continuous delivery

10
00:00:19,920 --> 00:00:23,119
continuous integration but

11
00:00:23,119 --> 00:00:26,400
never about continuous verification i do

12
00:00:26,400 --> 00:00:27,599
have heard about the myths of

13
00:00:27,599 --> 00:00:28,640
reliability but

14
00:00:28,640 --> 00:00:31,599
i'm really interested to see your points

15
00:00:31,599 --> 00:00:32,159
on that

16
00:00:32,159 --> 00:00:35,520
so please take the floor

17
00:00:35,520 --> 00:00:37,680
cool thanks a lot uh see can you hear me

18
00:00:37,680 --> 00:00:38,559
all right

19
00:00:38,559 --> 00:00:42,840
yeah your setup if i just share your

20
00:00:42,840 --> 00:00:44,719
screen

21
00:00:44,719 --> 00:00:47,039
yep

22
00:00:48,879 --> 00:00:50,960
okay you should be able to see uh the

23
00:00:50,960 --> 00:00:52,559
words continuous verification

24
00:00:52,559 --> 00:00:56,640
and the middle reliability now yeah

25
00:00:56,640 --> 00:00:59,920
great cool um and hopefully um

26
00:00:59,920 --> 00:01:02,719
uh we have a good uh q a session at the

27
00:01:02,719 --> 00:01:03,359
end here

28
00:01:03,359 --> 00:01:06,240
i i hope to uh uh not just introduce the

29
00:01:06,240 --> 00:01:08,640
topic of continuous verification but

30
00:01:08,640 --> 00:01:10,720
say some things that are um hopefully

31
00:01:10,720 --> 00:01:13,040
controversial to some audiences

32
00:01:13,040 --> 00:01:16,080
so uh my name is casey rosenthal

33
00:01:16,080 --> 00:01:19,200
um i wanna make sure that slides advance

34
00:01:19,200 --> 00:01:19,600
here

35
00:01:19,600 --> 00:01:21,520
i work for a company called varica but

36
00:01:21,520 --> 00:01:23,200
i'm not really gonna talk about

37
00:01:23,200 --> 00:01:27,200
that um so i'm just gonna dive into it

38
00:01:27,200 --> 00:01:31,200
in the 1480s uh i was a port carpenter

39
00:01:31,200 --> 00:01:34,159
and uh occasional uh boswing in the port

40
00:01:34,159 --> 00:01:35,280
of palos

41
00:01:35,280 --> 00:01:37,600
i worked for a gentleman named juan de

42
00:01:37,600 --> 00:01:38,479
la coza

43
00:01:38,479 --> 00:01:41,360
southern coast of uh spain and i got to

44
00:01:41,360 --> 00:01:41,840
work on

45
00:01:41,840 --> 00:01:44,000
on this ship um well i couldn't find a

46
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:45,360
photo of it but you know here's a

47
00:01:45,360 --> 00:01:46,560
painting of the ship

48
00:01:46,560 --> 00:01:50,159
uh and now uh called the uh la gallega

49
00:01:50,159 --> 00:01:54,720
and um uh one day in the late 1480s

50
00:01:54,720 --> 00:01:58,560
a vc-backed startup came into town

51
00:01:58,560 --> 00:02:01,200
and back then vc was was a little bit

52
00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:02,079
different

53
00:02:02,079 --> 00:02:04,880
uh the way it worked um this particular

54
00:02:04,880 --> 00:02:06,880
startup because of his backers

55
00:02:06,880 --> 00:02:09,520
was uh had a different legal structure

56
00:02:09,520 --> 00:02:11,360
behind him so he was allowed to impress

57
00:02:11,360 --> 00:02:12,480
three ships into

58
00:02:12,480 --> 00:02:14,959
his service for uh this new startup

59
00:02:14,959 --> 00:02:16,239
venture

60
00:02:16,239 --> 00:02:19,360
that he was undertaking and

61
00:02:19,360 --> 00:02:21,840
like most startups he wanted to be

62
00:02:21,840 --> 00:02:23,680
data-driven about which

63
00:02:23,680 --> 00:02:26,800
ships he he took so

64
00:02:26,800 --> 00:02:29,040
um so they ran a study and they looked

65
00:02:29,040 --> 00:02:31,519
at a couple different factors

66
00:02:31,519 --> 00:02:33,760
for uh all of the ships and the ports

67
00:02:33,760 --> 00:02:35,760
and all along the southern coasts and

68
00:02:35,760 --> 00:02:36,160
even

69
00:02:36,160 --> 00:02:38,400
into parts of portugal and so they

70
00:02:38,400 --> 00:02:40,480
looked at three things for these ships

71
00:02:40,480 --> 00:02:42,959
um a lot of things but three things in

72
00:02:42,959 --> 00:02:43,840
particular

73
00:02:43,840 --> 00:02:45,599
how successful the ships were with their

74
00:02:45,599 --> 00:02:47,040
captains

75
00:02:47,040 --> 00:02:50,480
uh how risky the captains were and

76
00:02:50,480 --> 00:02:53,840
what the mortality rate was uh on

77
00:02:53,840 --> 00:02:56,000
on their ships essentially looking at

78
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:57,200
how safe

79
00:02:57,200 --> 00:03:00,480
the ships ships were and

80
00:03:00,480 --> 00:03:02,959
uh and just just to paint a little bit

81
00:03:02,959 --> 00:03:04,800
of background at the time

82
00:03:04,800 --> 00:03:08,159
um there was a a lot of

83
00:03:08,159 --> 00:03:09,920
a lot of wealth to be made a lot of

84
00:03:09,920 --> 00:03:11,440
success to be had

85
00:03:11,440 --> 00:03:14,560
um at the time fishing

86
00:03:14,560 --> 00:03:17,680
uh you know cod in particular off of

87
00:03:17,680 --> 00:03:22,159
the uh the northwestern atlantic off the

88
00:03:22,159 --> 00:03:22,640
coast

89
00:03:22,640 --> 00:03:26,560
of what's now the the united states

90
00:03:26,560 --> 00:03:28,239
but it was very risky particularly even

91
00:03:28,239 --> 00:03:30,000
just going around portugal

92
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:33,760
was was a very uh a risky place to

93
00:03:33,760 --> 00:03:36,959
um go fishing um and of course the

94
00:03:36,959 --> 00:03:40,480
the the the maps back then that

95
00:03:40,480 --> 00:03:42,799
identified where the the cod was

96
00:03:42,799 --> 00:03:44,640
uh those were all uh proprietary they

97
00:03:44,640 --> 00:03:46,480
hadn't yet really

98
00:03:46,480 --> 00:03:48,159
figured out the benefits of open source

99
00:03:48,159 --> 00:03:50,080
at that time

100
00:03:50,080 --> 00:03:52,000
so uh so there were there was a lot of

101
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:53,120
data to go through

102
00:03:53,120 --> 00:03:56,720
and um found some interesting results

103
00:03:56,720 --> 00:03:57,599
first of all the

104
00:03:57,599 --> 00:04:00,159
you know big success uh comes with big

105
00:04:00,159 --> 00:04:01,920
risks so it wasn't surprising that the

106
00:04:01,920 --> 00:04:02,959
captains

107
00:04:02,959 --> 00:04:06,319
uh who were a little bit riskier had

108
00:04:06,319 --> 00:04:08,319
better success and now everybody was

109
00:04:08,319 --> 00:04:10,319
starting off essentially from

110
00:04:10,319 --> 00:04:11,840
from the level playing field you know

111
00:04:11,840 --> 00:04:13,439
the typical life of the captain

112
00:04:13,439 --> 00:04:15,120
you'd wake up in the morning check a

113
00:04:15,120 --> 00:04:16,639
smartphone look at the weather report

114
00:04:16,639 --> 00:04:17,759
and everybody was getting the same

115
00:04:17,759 --> 00:04:19,279
weather report right

116
00:04:19,279 --> 00:04:22,960
so some of those captains you know saw a

117
00:04:22,960 --> 00:04:24,560
foggy weather report thought oh

118
00:04:24,560 --> 00:04:27,759
you know it'll we'll be fine and others

119
00:04:27,759 --> 00:04:29,199
thought oh okay that looks like

120
00:04:29,199 --> 00:04:30,160
inclement weather

121
00:04:30,160 --> 00:04:32,800
we'll stay home sit this one out so it

122
00:04:32,800 --> 00:04:34,320
makes sense that the ones that took more

123
00:04:34,320 --> 00:04:34,720
risk

124
00:04:34,720 --> 00:04:38,080
were more successful what was surprising

125
00:04:38,080 --> 00:04:39,360
is that the ones who took

126
00:04:39,360 --> 00:04:44,240
more risk also had lower mortality rates

127
00:04:44,240 --> 00:04:47,759
the ones who took more risk were safer

128
00:04:47,759 --> 00:04:49,520
they had safer they had better safety

129
00:04:49,520 --> 00:04:50,880
records

130
00:04:50,880 --> 00:04:52,639
and this was really fascinating to me so

131
00:04:52,639 --> 00:04:54,400
this this kind of kicked off my interest

132
00:04:54,400 --> 00:04:56,479
in in resilience engineering

133
00:04:56,479 --> 00:04:59,600
and uh and reliable systems

134
00:04:59,600 --> 00:05:01,199
and so how do we explain that result

135
00:05:01,199 --> 00:05:03,759
well the the captains and the crews

136
00:05:03,759 --> 00:05:06,400
that experienced increment weather that

137
00:05:06,400 --> 00:05:07,520
experienced

138
00:05:07,520 --> 00:05:10,320
uh bad fishing conditions basically

139
00:05:10,320 --> 00:05:11,039
build up

140
00:05:11,039 --> 00:05:13,680
built up over time levels of experience

141
00:05:13,680 --> 00:05:14,080
and

142
00:05:14,080 --> 00:05:16,720
ways of coping and adapting to

143
00:05:16,720 --> 00:05:18,400
unpredictable circumstances

144
00:05:18,400 --> 00:05:21,039
that when a really bad storm came in

145
00:05:21,039 --> 00:05:23,360
which was usually a surprise

146
00:05:23,360 --> 00:05:25,919
they had the skills to to know how to

147
00:05:25,919 --> 00:05:27,120
navigate it

148
00:05:27,120 --> 00:05:30,320
and and successfully deal with that

149
00:05:30,320 --> 00:05:31,199
situation

150
00:05:31,199 --> 00:05:34,240
whereas the ones who avoided that

151
00:05:34,240 --> 00:05:36,320
experience

152
00:05:36,320 --> 00:05:37,759
basically when they got caught by

153
00:05:37,759 --> 00:05:39,759
surprise uh there was nothing

154
00:05:39,759 --> 00:05:42,000
that they could uh that they could do

155
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:43,440
about it they didn't have the skills to

156
00:05:43,440 --> 00:05:46,560
handle that kind of situation um if you

157
00:05:46,560 --> 00:05:48,000
look closely i don't know how this

158
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:49,680
carries over screencasting you can see

159
00:05:49,680 --> 00:05:51,280
me in the painting there that's

160
00:05:51,280 --> 00:05:54,720
where i am so a few years later i got

161
00:05:54,720 --> 00:05:55,280
into

162
00:05:55,280 --> 00:05:58,240
um many years later i got into shoe

163
00:05:58,240 --> 00:05:59,120
cobbling

164
00:05:59,120 --> 00:06:00,720
uh which was a really great business

165
00:06:00,720 --> 00:06:03,280
this was my my mentor for a while so

166
00:06:03,280 --> 00:06:03,840
this is

167
00:06:03,840 --> 00:06:07,520
in the 1850s i was in chillicothe which

168
00:06:07,520 --> 00:06:09,840
was a big metropolis in

169
00:06:09,840 --> 00:06:13,360
ohio at the time and

170
00:06:13,360 --> 00:06:15,600
uh yeah shoes were a really great

171
00:06:15,600 --> 00:06:18,479
business to be in in the 1850s

172
00:06:18,479 --> 00:06:21,600
because uh cities back then were were

173
00:06:21,600 --> 00:06:23,600
filthy it wasn't like a modern city like

174
00:06:23,600 --> 00:06:24,960
san francisco if you walk down the

175
00:06:24,960 --> 00:06:26,240
street today you know it's

176
00:06:26,240 --> 00:06:28,720
super clean uh back then that the

177
00:06:28,720 --> 00:06:29,520
streets were

178
00:06:29,520 --> 00:06:32,560
were just uh well frankly disgusting so

179
00:06:32,560 --> 00:06:34,000
if you were in the shoe business people

180
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:36,960
had to go through shoes uh really uh

181
00:06:36,960 --> 00:06:38,319
really often

182
00:06:38,319 --> 00:06:40,240
um so being in the shoe business you

183
00:06:40,240 --> 00:06:41,919
know you know you had a steady

184
00:06:41,919 --> 00:06:45,280
clientele so i worked for this this uh

185
00:06:45,280 --> 00:06:48,800
shoe manufacturing retail store

186
00:06:48,800 --> 00:06:52,080
and uh it got so popular uh that

187
00:06:52,080 --> 00:06:53,840
you know they would hit these peaks

188
00:06:53,840 --> 00:06:55,520
where they would have like thousands of

189
00:06:55,520 --> 00:06:57,120
orders per second

190
00:06:57,120 --> 00:06:59,599
um you know really good really good

191
00:06:59,599 --> 00:07:00,479
business really

192
00:07:00,479 --> 00:07:02,080
filthy city so people had to change

193
00:07:02,080 --> 00:07:04,720
their shoes really often

194
00:07:04,720 --> 00:07:07,840
and in order to handle that kind of load

195
00:07:07,840 --> 00:07:09,520
they had to you know we had to change

196
00:07:09,520 --> 00:07:11,039
the retail experience so basically

197
00:07:11,039 --> 00:07:12,400
people would come up and

198
00:07:12,400 --> 00:07:15,199
and place orders and then we would have

199
00:07:15,199 --> 00:07:16,639
people we call them racers

200
00:07:16,639 --> 00:07:19,280
who would uh race back to a blackboard

201
00:07:19,280 --> 00:07:20,000
and put

202
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:22,880
chalk marks next to the kind of shoe

203
00:07:22,880 --> 00:07:23,919
that was

204
00:07:23,919 --> 00:07:25,919
being requested that was being bought

205
00:07:25,919 --> 00:07:27,520
and we would have other racers

206
00:07:27,520 --> 00:07:30,720
who would run back to the warehouse to

207
00:07:30,720 --> 00:07:31,599
get it and

208
00:07:31,599 --> 00:07:34,160
come back and hand it off um so it could

209
00:07:34,160 --> 00:07:34,720
be run

210
00:07:34,720 --> 00:07:38,240
up to the the front of the store and uh

211
00:07:38,240 --> 00:07:40,000
when we had this much traffic sometimes

212
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:41,360
things would get a little out of hand

213
00:07:41,360 --> 00:07:44,160
in fact they called the uh the the

214
00:07:44,160 --> 00:07:44,879
blackboard

215
00:07:44,879 --> 00:07:47,680
um the zoo um and they're you know there

216
00:07:47,680 --> 00:07:49,360
was a keeper of the zoo and things would

217
00:07:49,360 --> 00:07:50,080
get kind of

218
00:07:50,080 --> 00:07:52,639
uh hectic uh there and sometimes they

219
00:07:52,639 --> 00:07:54,240
would get so hectic that people would

220
00:07:54,240 --> 00:07:55,199
get impatient

221
00:07:55,199 --> 00:07:58,080
and put an extra put another line uh of

222
00:07:58,080 --> 00:07:59,520
chalk next to the product

223
00:07:59,520 --> 00:08:00,800
uh because they would assume the first

224
00:08:00,800 --> 00:08:03,280
one wasn't seen um and then

225
00:08:03,280 --> 00:08:04,800
you know when they got their shoes they

226
00:08:04,800 --> 00:08:06,319
would they would go up and some people

227
00:08:06,319 --> 00:08:07,599
would be standing there left

228
00:08:07,599 --> 00:08:10,479
with an extra pair of shoes so things

229
00:08:10,479 --> 00:08:12,720
got out of hand and eventually that

230
00:08:12,720 --> 00:08:14,240
blackboard got so

231
00:08:14,240 --> 00:08:17,599
uh bad so out of out of alignment with

232
00:08:17,599 --> 00:08:19,759
uh reality that the the shoe store that

233
00:08:19,759 --> 00:08:20,479
the whole

234
00:08:20,479 --> 00:08:23,120
operation had to be shut down so that

235
00:08:23,120 --> 00:08:24,479
they could

236
00:08:24,479 --> 00:08:27,520
retake inventory um you know of the

237
00:08:27,520 --> 00:08:29,039
stock of shoes that they had

238
00:08:29,039 --> 00:08:31,919
basically clear that uh chalkboard off

239
00:08:31,919 --> 00:08:32,479
and

240
00:08:32,479 --> 00:08:35,919
uh start over took um it took

241
00:08:35,919 --> 00:08:38,640
over 24 hours and the problem was

242
00:08:38,640 --> 00:08:39,679
without without

243
00:08:39,679 --> 00:08:42,159
having access to shoes um nobody wanted

244
00:08:42,159 --> 00:08:43,919
to go outside

245
00:08:43,919 --> 00:08:46,640
so uh basically all of the businesses on

246
00:08:46,640 --> 00:08:47,680
main street uh

247
00:08:47,680 --> 00:08:49,839
shut down uh for a day you know it's

248
00:08:49,839 --> 00:08:51,120
kind of hard to imagine now

249
00:08:51,120 --> 00:08:53,200
but um you know every like business was

250
00:08:53,200 --> 00:08:54,399
just shut down

251
00:08:54,399 --> 00:08:57,279
everybody was stuck at home and so

252
00:08:57,279 --> 00:08:58,480
because of that

253
00:08:58,480 --> 00:09:00,240
everybody started pulling on their

254
00:09:00,240 --> 00:09:02,320
insurance policies

255
00:09:02,320 --> 00:09:04,320
and the ohio life insurance and trust

256
00:09:04,320 --> 00:09:05,600
company

257
00:09:05,600 --> 00:09:08,320
didn't have enough money to to cover all

258
00:09:08,320 --> 00:09:08,880
of these

259
00:09:08,880 --> 00:09:11,200
uh businesses it was overextended and it

260
00:09:11,200 --> 00:09:12,000
wasn't really

261
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:13,760
uh there wasn't really a government

262
00:09:13,760 --> 00:09:15,760
entity in place to to back up that

263
00:09:15,760 --> 00:09:16,959
insurance

264
00:09:16,959 --> 00:09:18,880
and so the ohio life insurance and trust

265
00:09:18,880 --> 00:09:21,519
company uh went bankrupt

266
00:09:21,519 --> 00:09:24,720
and that kicked off the

267
00:09:24,720 --> 00:09:28,720
uh the global depression of 1857.

268
00:09:28,720 --> 00:09:30,320
so what's interesting here is you can

269
00:09:30,320 --> 00:09:32,399
see like you know even a localized

270
00:09:32,399 --> 00:09:35,440
effect can have a vast

271
00:09:35,440 --> 00:09:38,640
global impact

272
00:09:39,760 --> 00:09:41,440
and and so that's a that's an

273
00:09:41,440 --> 00:09:43,120
interesting takeaway for

274
00:09:43,120 --> 00:09:45,760
uh safety and reliability in complex

275
00:09:45,760 --> 00:09:46,640
systems

276
00:09:46,640 --> 00:09:48,480
um and it kind of gets into a little bit

277
00:09:48,480 --> 00:09:49,680
of

278
00:09:49,680 --> 00:09:50,959
you know chaos theory i'm sure

279
00:09:50,959 --> 00:09:53,040
everybody's familiar with that

280
00:09:53,040 --> 00:09:55,680
that old expression um if uh if a

281
00:09:55,680 --> 00:09:56,399
butterfly

282
00:09:56,399 --> 00:09:59,360
flaps its wings in china and that causes

283
00:09:59,360 --> 00:10:01,040
somebody to sneeze that can cause a

284
00:10:01,040 --> 00:10:02,800
pandemic and an economic collapse

285
00:10:02,800 --> 00:10:04,160
halfway around the world

286
00:10:04,160 --> 00:10:07,279
i think that's how that goes anyway

287
00:10:07,279 --> 00:10:11,680
um so yeah the recession was caused uh

288
00:10:11,680 --> 00:10:14,959
by the success of this store uh there's

289
00:10:14,959 --> 00:10:17,920
me in the photo by the way a few years

290
00:10:17,920 --> 00:10:18,720
later

291
00:10:18,720 --> 00:10:21,920
i was out in hayward

292
00:10:21,920 --> 00:10:23,360
which is in the bay area for those of

293
00:10:23,360 --> 00:10:26,720
you not familiar with california

294
00:10:26,800 --> 00:10:30,000
and at the time hayward was

295
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:32,240
you know bustling up and coming city in

296
00:10:32,240 --> 00:10:33,760
fact the whole bay area

297
00:10:33,760 --> 00:10:36,800
in california uh is you know had the

298
00:10:36,800 --> 00:10:38,800
nickname garden of eden it had some of

299
00:10:38,800 --> 00:10:39,200
the

300
00:10:39,200 --> 00:10:42,160
the most productive most fertile soil uh

301
00:10:42,160 --> 00:10:44,079
in the world at the time

302
00:10:44,079 --> 00:10:46,560
um and so a lot of farming going on uh

303
00:10:46,560 --> 00:10:49,440
you know californians were prescient uh

304
00:10:49,440 --> 00:10:51,360
eventually they they learned to pave

305
00:10:51,360 --> 00:10:53,519
that over to seal the nutrients in the

306
00:10:53,519 --> 00:10:54,800
ground

307
00:10:54,800 --> 00:10:56,320
uh but at the time a lot of farming

308
00:10:56,320 --> 00:10:58,480
going on and a friend of mine this this

309
00:10:58,480 --> 00:11:00,079
wasn't me but a friend of mine worked

310
00:11:00,079 --> 00:11:03,360
for a fruit company

311
00:11:03,360 --> 00:11:07,120
this fruit company sold apricots

312
00:11:07,120 --> 00:11:11,040
and it was just a massive massive

313
00:11:11,040 --> 00:11:13,360
operation they would essentially bring

314
00:11:13,360 --> 00:11:14,880
these uh

315
00:11:14,880 --> 00:11:18,320
apricot trees in on uh in crates in

316
00:11:18,320 --> 00:11:20,399
like containers and then they had this

317
00:11:20,399 --> 00:11:22,560
whole uh

318
00:11:22,560 --> 00:11:24,800
again massive operation to clear land

319
00:11:24,800 --> 00:11:26,399
and figure out the best

320
00:11:26,399 --> 00:11:29,200
place to place these containers for

321
00:11:29,200 --> 00:11:30,880
sunlight and water and all of that

322
00:11:30,880 --> 00:11:32,480
and they had infrastructure to bring

323
00:11:32,480 --> 00:11:34,880
water in to water

324
00:11:34,880 --> 00:11:38,720
the trees and one day

325
00:11:38,800 --> 00:11:42,000
an engineer was hired to figure out a a

326
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:46,160
better way to to more compactly

327
00:11:46,160 --> 00:11:49,360
placed the the containers

328
00:11:49,360 --> 00:11:51,120
and and he did and he wrote that

329
00:11:51,120 --> 00:11:54,839
algorithm and put it into production

330
00:11:54,839 --> 00:11:58,000
unfortunately the uh the way that

331
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:00,160
algorithm worked it required

332
00:12:00,160 --> 00:12:03,360
the people digging the holes to come

333
00:12:03,360 --> 00:12:06,639
to a centralized table and scan a whole

334
00:12:06,639 --> 00:12:07,519
table

335
00:12:07,519 --> 00:12:10,560
every time they needed to to move any of

336
00:12:10,560 --> 00:12:11,440
the containers

337
00:12:11,440 --> 00:12:14,880
anywhere which basically caused the uh

338
00:12:14,880 --> 00:12:18,160
too much traffic at this one um you know

339
00:12:18,160 --> 00:12:19,920
base of data where they had this table

340
00:12:19,920 --> 00:12:21,760
everybody had to have to read the same

341
00:12:21,760 --> 00:12:22,959
table to make any of these

342
00:12:22,959 --> 00:12:26,079
these moves and uh

343
00:12:26,079 --> 00:12:29,600
that caused other things to to queue up

344
00:12:29,600 --> 00:12:31,440
and stop and slow down crawl

345
00:12:31,440 --> 00:12:33,519
and for example even backing out this

346
00:12:33,519 --> 00:12:34,639
algorithm

347
00:12:34,639 --> 00:12:36,560
required people coming to the table to

348
00:12:36,560 --> 00:12:37,920
undo that and they couldn't get to the

349
00:12:37,920 --> 00:12:39,600
table because it's crowded with too many

350
00:12:39,600 --> 00:12:40,639
people

351
00:12:40,639 --> 00:12:44,639
so the whole operation ground to a halt

352
00:12:44,639 --> 00:12:46,079
and unfortunately

353
00:12:46,079 --> 00:12:47,279
they had already built the

354
00:12:47,279 --> 00:12:50,079
infrastructure to pump water into this

355
00:12:50,079 --> 00:12:52,639
land the the land got saturated with

356
00:12:52,639 --> 00:12:53,839
water

357
00:12:53,839 --> 00:12:55,839
it got uh too heavy and the trees

358
00:12:55,839 --> 00:12:56,959
weren't there to soak it up and

359
00:12:56,959 --> 00:12:58,079
distribute it

360
00:12:58,079 --> 00:13:04,160
so that caused the uh earthquake of 1868

361
00:13:04,480 --> 00:13:06,959
and uh what's interesting about about

362
00:13:06,959 --> 00:13:08,800
this example about this this failure

363
00:13:08,800 --> 00:13:09,600
this lack of

364
00:13:09,600 --> 00:13:12,880
uh safety here is uh whereas previously

365
00:13:12,880 --> 00:13:14,639
we were seeing like okay there's there's

366
00:13:14,639 --> 00:13:18,000
these unanticipated consequences now we

367
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:18,800
start to see like

368
00:13:18,800 --> 00:13:20,639
even in a system that's planned and

369
00:13:20,639 --> 00:13:21,920
fully engineered

370
00:13:21,920 --> 00:13:23,680
we can have these unanticipated

371
00:13:23,680 --> 00:13:24,959
consequences

372
00:13:24,959 --> 00:13:27,839
that reverberate and impact at a system

373
00:13:27,839 --> 00:13:29,920
level at a holistic level

374
00:13:29,920 --> 00:13:33,200
and cause undesirable systemic effects

375
00:13:33,200 --> 00:13:35,680
so the the you know in line with uh the

376
00:13:35,680 --> 00:13:36,959
experiences at the time

377
00:13:36,959 --> 00:13:38,639
you know the one person who made that

378
00:13:38,639 --> 00:13:40,320
algorithm they basically ran him out of

379
00:13:40,320 --> 00:13:42,000
town

380
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:44,000
i think i think he fled to japan or

381
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:45,839
something to

382
00:13:45,839 --> 00:13:48,079
be someplace where they didn't

383
00:13:48,079 --> 00:13:50,240
experience earthquakes

384
00:13:50,240 --> 00:13:51,760
we didn't know a lot about geography

385
00:13:51,760 --> 00:13:53,440
back then uh

386
00:13:53,440 --> 00:13:56,720
and um and they considered the problem

387
00:13:56,720 --> 00:13:58,480
solved right they got rid of the person

388
00:13:58,480 --> 00:14:01,279
who had written the band algorithm and

389
00:14:01,279 --> 00:14:02,240
they figured

390
00:14:02,240 --> 00:14:05,040
that made the system more reliable going

391
00:14:05,040 --> 00:14:06,399
forward

392
00:14:06,399 --> 00:14:08,399
narrator's voice that did not make the

393
00:14:08,399 --> 00:14:10,320
system more reliable

394
00:14:10,320 --> 00:14:11,920
uh hard to see but there's me in the

395
00:14:11,920 --> 00:14:14,319
photo

396
00:14:14,560 --> 00:14:17,839
so um

397
00:14:17,920 --> 00:14:21,120
in the 1890s um i was

398
00:14:21,120 --> 00:14:24,240
uh managing uh a couple teams

399
00:14:24,240 --> 00:14:28,160
in uh in a helium mine situation

400
00:14:28,160 --> 00:14:30,399
and you know i've got these things in

401
00:14:30,399 --> 00:14:31,839
the back of my mind of you know our

402
00:14:31,839 --> 00:14:34,480
intuition about you know more risk like

403
00:14:34,480 --> 00:14:37,519
you know feels like it's less safe and

404
00:14:37,519 --> 00:14:40,560
you know how do we how do we uh uh

405
00:14:40,560 --> 00:14:43,199
think about you know the chaos theory

406
00:14:43,199 --> 00:14:44,800
where there's unanticipated

407
00:14:44,800 --> 00:14:46,560
consequences to the decisions that we

408
00:14:46,560 --> 00:14:48,560
make how do we actually make systems

409
00:14:48,560 --> 00:14:49,440
safer

410
00:14:49,440 --> 00:14:51,680
well we had an experience where we we

411
00:14:51,680 --> 00:14:53,120
ran short at a couple

412
00:14:53,120 --> 00:14:55,279
of these mines and this healing mind was

413
00:14:55,279 --> 00:14:56,959
you know we were cash strapped healing

414
00:14:56,959 --> 00:14:59,440
mining turned out not to be a great

415
00:14:59,440 --> 00:15:01,680
thing to try to mine for

416
00:15:01,680 --> 00:15:04,959
and uh we had some engineers at sub

417
00:15:04,959 --> 00:15:05,440
mines

418
00:15:05,440 --> 00:15:08,560
who would basically find places where

419
00:15:08,560 --> 00:15:10,160
the cave collapsed and they would spend

420
00:15:10,160 --> 00:15:11,120
all of their time

421
00:15:11,120 --> 00:15:13,760
getting really good at reinforcing those

422
00:15:13,760 --> 00:15:16,560
and reinforcing their defenses

423
00:15:16,560 --> 00:15:19,199
and at uh some other mines where we had

424
00:15:19,199 --> 00:15:20,800
fewer resources

425
00:15:20,800 --> 00:15:23,279
we basically had people who got really

426
00:15:23,279 --> 00:15:23,920
good at

427
00:15:23,920 --> 00:15:26,959
figuring out how to educate the

428
00:15:26,959 --> 00:15:28,160
engineers

429
00:15:28,160 --> 00:15:31,279
to uh as to as to whether the

430
00:15:31,279 --> 00:15:33,120
the walls that they were digging into

431
00:15:33,120 --> 00:15:34,399
that the material that

432
00:15:34,399 --> 00:15:37,680
they were digging into uh was soft or

433
00:15:37,680 --> 00:15:41,120
or prone to failure and we found

434
00:15:41,120 --> 00:15:44,880
that um in the the latter case

435
00:15:44,880 --> 00:15:48,240
actually had a better safety record so

436
00:15:48,240 --> 00:15:50,000
uh even though they were working in

437
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:52,480
minds that weren't being reinforced as

438
00:15:52,480 --> 00:15:53,040
often

439
00:15:53,040 --> 00:15:56,880
or as well the engineers we found were

440
00:15:56,880 --> 00:15:59,759
actually implicitly making decisions

441
00:15:59,759 --> 00:16:02,959
that led to better outcomes

442
00:16:02,959 --> 00:16:06,000
here's me in that photo

443
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:09,199
and so this plays into a model um

444
00:16:09,199 --> 00:16:11,600
uh later formalized by uh yansa

445
00:16:11,600 --> 00:16:13,199
rasmussen

446
00:16:13,199 --> 00:16:17,199
that uh is kind of a foundation

447
00:16:17,199 --> 00:16:19,839
for a proactive approach to making

448
00:16:19,839 --> 00:16:20,480
systems

449
00:16:20,480 --> 00:16:23,600
more reliable so

450
00:16:23,600 --> 00:16:25,360
in this model there's there's you know

451
00:16:25,360 --> 00:16:27,600
these three pillars economics workload

452
00:16:27,600 --> 00:16:30,639
and safety and the model says that

453
00:16:30,639 --> 00:16:31,360
engineers

454
00:16:31,360 --> 00:16:33,680
basically implicitly change their

455
00:16:33,680 --> 00:16:35,519
behavior to optimize for these

456
00:16:35,519 --> 00:16:37,279
three things you don't have to tell them

457
00:16:37,279 --> 00:16:39,839
to do this and i'll give i'll give a

458
00:16:39,839 --> 00:16:43,759
software example um

459
00:16:43,920 --> 00:16:46,079
you you probably don't have a rule at

460
00:16:46,079 --> 00:16:46,959
your company or

461
00:16:46,959 --> 00:16:48,720
or wherever you work or at a company

462
00:16:48,720 --> 00:16:50,079
that you even know about

463
00:16:50,079 --> 00:16:51,920
there probably is not a rule that you're

464
00:16:51,920 --> 00:16:53,519
not allowed

465
00:16:53,519 --> 00:16:56,880
to spin up a million

466
00:16:56,880 --> 00:17:01,199
ec2 instances on aws for example

467
00:17:01,199 --> 00:17:02,959
why don't we have those obviously that's

468
00:17:02,959 --> 00:17:04,400
a bad thing to do

469
00:17:04,400 --> 00:17:06,559
and that's kind of the point engineers

470
00:17:06,559 --> 00:17:07,919
implicitly know

471
00:17:07,919 --> 00:17:10,480
that things cost money and that if you

472
00:17:10,480 --> 00:17:12,240
run out of money you're out of business

473
00:17:12,240 --> 00:17:13,760
game over

474
00:17:13,760 --> 00:17:16,160
so you don't stray too far from this

475
00:17:16,160 --> 00:17:18,160
economics pillar you can kind of imagine

476
00:17:18,160 --> 00:17:19,679
that you're in the middle here

477
00:17:19,679 --> 00:17:20,880
and that you're attached to each of

478
00:17:20,880 --> 00:17:22,799
these three pillars by a rubber band and

479
00:17:22,799 --> 00:17:23,439
if you stretch

480
00:17:23,439 --> 00:17:26,240
too far the rubber band will snap and

481
00:17:26,240 --> 00:17:28,000
it's game over

482
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:29,840
so everybody implicitly knows there's

483
00:17:29,840 --> 00:17:31,520
there's an economic

484
00:17:31,520 --> 00:17:33,840
poll and that there's a safety margin

485
00:17:33,840 --> 00:17:35,840
there the same is true of workload

486
00:17:35,840 --> 00:17:37,039
everybody knows that

487
00:17:37,039 --> 00:17:38,400
their servers can handle a certain

488
00:17:38,400 --> 00:17:40,160
amount of workload

489
00:17:40,160 --> 00:17:42,320
and people can handle a certain amount

490
00:17:42,320 --> 00:17:43,280
of workload

491
00:17:43,280 --> 00:17:46,000
and if you try to do too much it's that

492
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:47,600
that rubber band is going to snap here

493
00:17:47,600 --> 00:17:48,720
it's just going to fail and it's going

494
00:17:48,720 --> 00:17:51,520
to be game over and the same is true

495
00:17:51,520 --> 00:17:54,400
with safety the difference with safety

496
00:17:54,400 --> 00:17:55,679
and the other two

497
00:17:55,679 --> 00:17:57,760
is that most engineers don't have an

498
00:17:57,760 --> 00:17:58,960
intuition

499
00:17:58,960 --> 00:18:01,440
of how far they're stretching that

500
00:18:01,440 --> 00:18:02,640
rubber band

501
00:18:02,640 --> 00:18:04,000
from safety they don't know what their

502
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:06,000
safety margin is

503
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:07,679
and i'm comfortable saying that because

504
00:18:07,679 --> 00:18:09,600
we still have incidents

505
00:18:09,600 --> 00:18:12,640
and we have incidents mostly because

506
00:18:12,640 --> 00:18:15,120
they're surprises

507
00:18:15,120 --> 00:18:16,960
be it an availability incident or a

508
00:18:16,960 --> 00:18:19,919
security incident

509
00:18:20,240 --> 00:18:21,919
usually they're they're surprised

510
00:18:21,919 --> 00:18:23,520
because the engineers have no idea if

511
00:18:23,520 --> 00:18:24,960
you knew that you were about to have an

512
00:18:24,960 --> 00:18:27,679
outage for example

513
00:18:27,679 --> 00:18:29,679
as an engineer you would stop what you

514
00:18:29,679 --> 00:18:30,960
were doing and

515
00:18:30,960 --> 00:18:32,640
uh change something about the

516
00:18:32,640 --> 00:18:34,559
architecture so that

517
00:18:34,559 --> 00:18:37,600
the outage didn't happen same is true

518
00:18:37,600 --> 00:18:40,400
with the security incident

519
00:18:40,400 --> 00:18:43,760
so uh if you're able to build up an

520
00:18:43,760 --> 00:18:45,520
intuition for engineers for what the

521
00:18:45,520 --> 00:18:46,799
safety margin is

522
00:18:46,799 --> 00:18:48,320
they will implicitly change their

523
00:18:48,320 --> 00:18:50,960
behavior and make a more reliable system

524
00:18:50,960 --> 00:18:53,840
and this is one of the foundational uh

525
00:18:53,840 --> 00:18:54,720
theories behind

526
00:18:54,720 --> 00:18:57,840
chaos engineering which is something

527
00:18:57,840 --> 00:19:00,559
that we defined at netflix when i was

528
00:19:00,559 --> 00:19:01,600
there

529
00:19:01,600 --> 00:19:04,080
managed the chaos engineering team there

530
00:19:04,080 --> 00:19:04,720
uh

531
00:19:04,720 --> 00:19:06,240
we have a manifesto of sorts that

532
00:19:06,240 --> 00:19:07,919
principles of chaos that are defining

533
00:19:07,919 --> 00:19:10,559
chaos engineering as a proactive

534
00:19:10,559 --> 00:19:13,280
discipline to improve the reliability of

535
00:19:13,280 --> 00:19:14,720
systems

536
00:19:14,720 --> 00:19:16,960
my favorite definition is this one chaos

537
00:19:16,960 --> 00:19:18,160
engineering is the first

538
00:19:18,160 --> 00:19:20,559
facilitation of experiments to uncover

539
00:19:20,559 --> 00:19:22,080
systemic weaknesses

540
00:19:22,080 --> 00:19:24,640
so we basically create experiments to

541
00:19:24,640 --> 00:19:26,480
identify the safety margin

542
00:19:26,480 --> 00:19:28,640
and feed that information back to

543
00:19:28,640 --> 00:19:30,480
software engineers which implicitly

544
00:19:30,480 --> 00:19:31,280
changes

545
00:19:31,280 --> 00:19:36,879
their behavior to to be more reliable

546
00:19:36,960 --> 00:19:39,120
uh so one one other point uh i want to

547
00:19:39,120 --> 00:19:40,320
mention with

548
00:19:40,320 --> 00:19:42,880
you know the uh switching over to

549
00:19:42,880 --> 00:19:43,840
software

550
00:19:43,840 --> 00:19:48,000
uh with um historical um significance

551
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:50,720
uh here's here's generally how we see

552
00:19:50,720 --> 00:19:51,520
software

553
00:19:51,520 --> 00:19:53,679
or how how the world sees software well

554
00:19:53,679 --> 00:19:55,039
how software sees itself

555
00:19:55,039 --> 00:19:56,640
the chief merit of software engineering

556
00:19:56,640 --> 00:19:58,160
is this technical efficiency with the

557
00:19:58,160 --> 00:20:00,080
premium placed on precision speed expert

558
00:20:00,080 --> 00:20:02,080
control continuity discretion optimal

559
00:20:02,080 --> 00:20:04,400
returns on input

560
00:20:04,400 --> 00:20:08,080
i actually um accidentally did this

561
00:20:08,080 --> 00:20:09,520
so that's that's actually a description

562
00:20:09,520 --> 00:20:12,480
of bureaucracy

563
00:20:14,559 --> 00:20:16,640
but from a sociological perspective

564
00:20:16,640 --> 00:20:18,000
that's that's true

565
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:20,080
software engineering is the bureaucratic

566
00:20:20,080 --> 00:20:21,679
profession and i

567
00:20:21,679 --> 00:20:23,200
recognize this probably won't make it

568
00:20:23,200 --> 00:20:25,039
onto too many t-shirts

569
00:20:25,039 --> 00:20:27,600
but it's true no other industry in

570
00:20:27,600 --> 00:20:28,159
general

571
00:20:28,159 --> 00:20:30,559
does a better job of separating who

572
00:20:30,559 --> 00:20:31,200
decides

573
00:20:31,200 --> 00:20:33,919
what gets done from who decides how it's

574
00:20:33,919 --> 00:20:34,799
going to be done

575
00:20:34,799 --> 00:20:38,640
from the people doing the actual work

576
00:20:38,640 --> 00:20:40,400
and the problem with that is that this

577
00:20:40,400 --> 00:20:42,159
is a model

578
00:20:42,159 --> 00:20:45,919
based on uh scientific management and

579
00:20:45,919 --> 00:20:48,799
taylorism going back to you know the the

580
00:20:48,799 --> 00:20:50,960
19 teens

581
00:20:50,960 --> 00:20:54,640
it's the wrong model for knowledge work

582
00:20:54,640 --> 00:20:56,240
and if we think of ourselves as

583
00:20:56,240 --> 00:20:58,000
knowledge workers and i

584
00:20:58,000 --> 00:20:59,280
tend to think software engineering

585
00:20:59,280 --> 00:21:01,200
should be knowledge work then we

586
00:21:01,200 --> 00:21:02,960
essentially have the wrong model right

587
00:21:02,960 --> 00:21:03,840
so this would be

588
00:21:03,840 --> 00:21:05,679
uh better for a t-shirt software

589
00:21:05,679 --> 00:21:08,960
engineer doing it wrong since 1913.

590
00:21:08,960 --> 00:21:12,159
um and most of the industry

591
00:21:12,159 --> 00:21:13,520
thinks that that's a good thing if you

592
00:21:13,520 --> 00:21:15,679
think of you know

593
00:21:15,679 --> 00:21:17,840
a typical team structure of a larger

594
00:21:17,840 --> 00:21:19,200
company you've got

595
00:21:19,200 --> 00:21:21,840
people managers product managers project

596
00:21:21,840 --> 00:21:22,880
managers

597
00:21:22,880 --> 00:21:26,000
uh tech leads architects all of those

598
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:27,440
roles are designed to take

599
00:21:27,440 --> 00:21:29,760
responsibility for engineering decisions

600
00:21:29,760 --> 00:21:32,480
away from the engineers

601
00:21:32,480 --> 00:21:34,320
in a knowledge work that's the wrong

602
00:21:34,320 --> 00:21:36,880
that's the wrong model so we end up with

603
00:21:36,880 --> 00:21:39,440
a bunch of myths about reliability

604
00:21:39,440 --> 00:21:40,480
things that seem

605
00:21:40,480 --> 00:21:43,120
intuitive but the data tells us is wrong

606
00:21:43,120 --> 00:21:44,400
so for example

607
00:21:44,400 --> 00:21:47,120
remove the people who cause accidents

608
00:21:47,120 --> 00:21:48,240
and you'll make your system more

609
00:21:48,240 --> 00:21:50,400
reliable this is called the bad apples

610
00:21:50,400 --> 00:21:53,760
model of management unfortunately this

611
00:21:53,760 --> 00:21:54,480
was

612
00:21:54,480 --> 00:21:56,240
tried in some hospitals in the united

613
00:21:56,240 --> 00:21:59,120
states a while back you know we'll just

614
00:21:59,120 --> 00:21:59,760
get rid of

615
00:21:59,760 --> 00:22:03,200
the doctors who have uh the worst uh

616
00:22:03,200 --> 00:22:03,919
rates

617
00:22:03,919 --> 00:22:05,919
but it turns out some people are

618
00:22:05,919 --> 00:22:08,480
attracted to the the hardest problems

619
00:22:08,480 --> 00:22:10,240
and have the most experience dealing

620
00:22:10,240 --> 00:22:12,400
with the hardest problems

621
00:22:12,400 --> 00:22:14,400
and so if you get rid of them you could

622
00:22:14,400 --> 00:22:16,000
end up with worse outcomes because

623
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:17,440
you're getting rid of the people

624
00:22:17,440 --> 00:22:18,960
who have the most experience dealing

625
00:22:18,960 --> 00:22:20,640
with the stuff nobody else wants to deal

626
00:22:20,640 --> 00:22:21,440
with

627
00:22:21,440 --> 00:22:25,039
so that doesn't work second myth

628
00:22:25,039 --> 00:22:26,720
you can make your system more reliable

629
00:22:26,720 --> 00:22:28,799
if you document best practices and run

630
00:22:28,799 --> 00:22:29,600
books

631
00:22:29,600 --> 00:22:31,280
so i'm not saying you shouldn't document

632
00:22:31,280 --> 00:22:33,760
things however if you invest in this as

633
00:22:33,760 --> 00:22:34,000
a

634
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:35,600
practice you're not going to move the

635
00:22:35,600 --> 00:22:37,600
needle on making your system more

636
00:22:37,600 --> 00:22:38,880
reliable

637
00:22:38,880 --> 00:22:40,720
and that's because making your system

638
00:22:40,720 --> 00:22:42,400
more reliable requires

639
00:22:42,400 --> 00:22:44,880
improvisation and adaptability to unique

640
00:22:44,880 --> 00:22:46,400
circumstances

641
00:22:46,400 --> 00:22:48,960
and documenting best practices and run

642
00:22:48,960 --> 00:22:49,440
books

643
00:22:49,440 --> 00:22:53,440
just doesn't give you that myth three

644
00:22:53,440 --> 00:22:55,039
you can make your system more reliable

645
00:22:55,039 --> 00:22:57,840
if you defend against prior root causes

646
00:22:57,840 --> 00:22:58,799
this is like

647
00:22:58,799 --> 00:23:00,799
defense and death this is like going in

648
00:23:00,799 --> 00:23:02,799
and um

649
00:23:02,799 --> 00:23:07,280
making the known holes uh sturdier

650
00:23:07,280 --> 00:23:09,440
not not saying you shouldn't do that you

651
00:23:09,440 --> 00:23:10,960
shouldn't i'm not saying you shouldn't

652
00:23:10,960 --> 00:23:12,880
patch things that you know are broken

653
00:23:12,880 --> 00:23:14,559
however that's not going to move the

654
00:23:14,559 --> 00:23:16,480
needle on reliability that's not going

655
00:23:16,480 --> 00:23:18,720
to make your system more reliable

656
00:23:18,720 --> 00:23:22,240
because uh um well for one thing

657
00:23:22,240 --> 00:23:24,799
let's pick apart this prior route causes

658
00:23:24,799 --> 00:23:26,720
in a complex system

659
00:23:26,720 --> 00:23:28,320
and most of us in software are now

660
00:23:28,320 --> 00:23:30,559
dealing with with complex systems

661
00:23:30,559 --> 00:23:32,799
in a complex system there is no root

662
00:23:32,799 --> 00:23:35,200
cause

663
00:23:35,200 --> 00:23:37,360
uh and i'm really looking forward to the

664
00:23:37,360 --> 00:23:39,280
q a part so i'll i'll go

665
00:23:39,280 --> 00:23:43,200
a little bit further and i'll say um

666
00:23:43,200 --> 00:23:45,200
if you're currently doing root cause

667
00:23:45,200 --> 00:23:47,520
analysis

668
00:23:47,520 --> 00:23:52,400
at best you are wasting your time

669
00:23:52,480 --> 00:23:54,240
hopefully that kicks off some some

670
00:23:54,240 --> 00:23:56,799
interesting questions

671
00:23:56,799 --> 00:23:59,440
um you know in the example of of the

672
00:23:59,440 --> 00:24:01,279
apricot farm

673
00:24:01,279 --> 00:24:02,880
it was very clear to say okay that one

674
00:24:02,880 --> 00:24:05,279
person changed the algorithm

675
00:24:05,279 --> 00:24:08,320
that was the root cause of the outage

676
00:24:08,320 --> 00:24:10,880
but there's another narrative there you

677
00:24:10,880 --> 00:24:12,720
know removing that one person saying

678
00:24:12,720 --> 00:24:14,080
that the algorithm was the cause it was

679
00:24:14,080 --> 00:24:15,200
the root cause

680
00:24:15,200 --> 00:24:17,440
fixing that doesn't make the system

681
00:24:17,440 --> 00:24:18,559
safer at all

682
00:24:18,559 --> 00:24:20,559
an alternative narrative narrative could

683
00:24:20,559 --> 00:24:21,840
be

684
00:24:21,840 --> 00:24:23,440
uh you know why didn't the people who

685
00:24:23,440 --> 00:24:24,960
designed the table

686
00:24:24,960 --> 00:24:27,039
uh where that algorithm was implemented

687
00:24:27,039 --> 00:24:28,799
why didn't they design that better

688
00:24:28,799 --> 00:24:31,039
maybe the root cause was you know the

689
00:24:31,039 --> 00:24:32,559
people who designed that

690
00:24:32,559 --> 00:24:35,679
base of data or that table or

691
00:24:35,679 --> 00:24:38,400
maybe it was whoever organized whoever

692
00:24:38,400 --> 00:24:40,240
was managing those groups who didn't

693
00:24:40,240 --> 00:24:41,520
have them communicate

694
00:24:41,520 --> 00:24:44,159
so they didn't figure out how those

695
00:24:44,159 --> 00:24:45,679
things could have impacted each other or

696
00:24:45,679 --> 00:24:47,279
the director above them

697
00:24:47,279 --> 00:24:49,760
who didn't understand or place enough

698
00:24:49,760 --> 00:24:51,760
emphasis on safety

699
00:24:51,760 --> 00:24:54,720
to figure out the implications of that

700
00:24:54,720 --> 00:24:55,039
thing

701
00:24:55,039 --> 00:24:58,080
failing or the vp above them who you

702
00:24:58,080 --> 00:24:59,679
know understood that the infrastructure

703
00:24:59,679 --> 00:25:01,440
was built to bring the water and or at

704
00:25:01,440 --> 00:25:04,240
the sea level maybe it was the the cto

705
00:25:04,240 --> 00:25:06,640
uh uh it was their fault for not

706
00:25:06,640 --> 00:25:08,000
prioritizing

707
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:10,480
uh all of that or investing in staging

708
00:25:10,480 --> 00:25:11,440
environments

709
00:25:11,440 --> 00:25:13,440
uh so that they could have uh tried some

710
00:25:13,440 --> 00:25:14,880
of these things out before they put the

711
00:25:14,880 --> 00:25:16,159
algorithm directly into

712
00:25:16,159 --> 00:25:19,279
production so maybe it's the ceo's cto's

713
00:25:19,279 --> 00:25:19,679
fault

714
00:25:19,679 --> 00:25:23,360
their ceo's fault right root cause

715
00:25:23,360 --> 00:25:26,480
is designed to find fault

716
00:25:26,480 --> 00:25:28,799
and in particular it's defined it's it's

717
00:25:28,799 --> 00:25:30,960
designed to find fault

718
00:25:30,960 --> 00:25:35,279
as low in the hierarchy as possible

719
00:25:35,360 --> 00:25:38,559
so basically root cause analysis is uh

720
00:25:38,559 --> 00:25:40,880
is a method by the hierarchy to

721
00:25:40,880 --> 00:25:42,000
reinforce the hierarchy

722
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:45,679
at the expense of the workers um so

723
00:25:45,679 --> 00:25:47,679
again which of those is going to have a

724
00:25:47,679 --> 00:25:49,679
bigger impact on reliability

725
00:25:49,679 --> 00:25:52,960
changing the cto's mind or and their

726
00:25:52,960 --> 00:25:54,000
behavior or

727
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:55,520
you know getting rid of the person who

728
00:25:55,520 --> 00:25:57,520
changed the algorithm obviously changing

729
00:25:57,520 --> 00:25:59,120
the the system as a whole is going to

730
00:25:59,120 --> 00:26:00,640
have a bigger impact

731
00:26:00,640 --> 00:26:03,520
enforcing procedures will not make your

732
00:26:03,520 --> 00:26:05,279
system more reliable

733
00:26:05,279 --> 00:26:07,200
avoiding risk the example i gave with

734
00:26:07,200 --> 00:26:08,640
the ships doesn't work

735
00:26:08,640 --> 00:26:11,279
simplifying a complex system actually

736
00:26:11,279 --> 00:26:13,200
takes the business value out because

737
00:26:13,200 --> 00:26:15,039
your business value is defined by

738
00:26:15,039 --> 00:26:18,080
complexity adding redundancy also does

739
00:26:18,080 --> 00:26:19,760
not make your system more reliable we

740
00:26:19,760 --> 00:26:21,600
have as many cases of

741
00:26:21,600 --> 00:26:24,880
redundancy contributing to

742
00:26:24,880 --> 00:26:27,200
system failures as we have of it

743
00:26:27,200 --> 00:26:30,000
preventing system failures

744
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:31,679
so the theme here is don't fight

745
00:26:31,679 --> 00:26:34,159
complexity you can't but you can learn

746
00:26:34,159 --> 00:26:35,520
to navigate it better

747
00:26:35,520 --> 00:26:38,480
so there's this evolution of ci to cd to

748
00:26:38,480 --> 00:26:39,360
cv

749
00:26:39,360 --> 00:26:42,640
ci helped us make code faster and

750
00:26:42,640 --> 00:26:44,320
you know limit the rate of bugs being

751
00:26:44,320 --> 00:26:45,679
produced by getting the code to

752
00:26:45,679 --> 00:26:48,720
together merged faster cd helped us put

753
00:26:48,720 --> 00:26:50,960
that code into production faster

754
00:26:50,960 --> 00:26:52,400
by giving you know automating that

755
00:26:52,400 --> 00:26:54,799
process that we can change our minds

756
00:26:54,799 --> 00:26:56,559
uh when the code is in production and

757
00:26:56,559 --> 00:26:59,120
roll forward quicker things like that

758
00:26:59,120 --> 00:27:02,080
and now cv says okay now that we can

759
00:27:02,080 --> 00:27:04,000
make code faster get into production

760
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:05,360
faster

761
00:27:05,360 --> 00:27:07,279
how do we make sure that we still get

762
00:27:07,279 --> 00:27:09,200
the properties out of the system

763
00:27:09,200 --> 00:27:10,960
that we want given all of that

764
00:27:10,960 --> 00:27:13,039
complexity that's quickly changing

765
00:27:13,039 --> 00:27:15,520
underneath

766
00:27:15,600 --> 00:27:17,279
just reading across the top you'll start

767
00:27:17,279 --> 00:27:18,880
to see tooling

768
00:27:18,880 --> 00:27:22,640
coming out well already in 2019 but

769
00:27:22,640 --> 00:27:24,080
you'll see enterprises picking

770
00:27:24,080 --> 00:27:25,440
continuous verification

771
00:27:25,440 --> 00:27:26,799
up because it's a proactive

772
00:27:26,799 --> 00:27:29,200
experimentation tooling discipline that

773
00:27:29,200 --> 00:27:30,880
verifies system behaviors

774
00:27:30,880 --> 00:27:32,559
whereas most of the stuff we currently

775
00:27:32,559 --> 00:27:34,960
have in the industry is reactive testing

776
00:27:34,960 --> 00:27:36,480
methodologies that validates

777
00:27:36,480 --> 00:27:38,640
known properties of systems which is

778
00:27:38,640 --> 00:27:39,679
still good

779
00:27:39,679 --> 00:27:42,080
it's just not helpful in navigating

780
00:27:42,080 --> 00:27:43,600
complex systems

781
00:27:43,600 --> 00:27:45,760
so tools don't create a lot reliability

782
00:27:45,760 --> 00:27:47,360
humans do

783
00:27:47,360 --> 00:27:50,720
but tools can help um if you want a

784
00:27:50,720 --> 00:27:53,360
free copy of this book chaos engineering

785
00:27:53,360 --> 00:27:54,559
that i co-wrote with

786
00:27:54,559 --> 00:27:57,120
nora jones an o'reilly book you can go

787
00:27:57,120 --> 00:27:58,240
to this link here

788
00:27:58,240 --> 00:28:00,840
and hopefully we have some time for our

789
00:28:00,840 --> 00:28:03,840
questions

790
00:28:04,880 --> 00:28:07,760
thank you casey

791
00:28:08,640 --> 00:28:12,080
very interesting presentation

792
00:28:12,080 --> 00:28:15,200
and also some eye openers

793
00:28:15,200 --> 00:28:18,480
for me very uh your mid

794
00:28:18,480 --> 00:28:21,840
uh really uh hit uh

795
00:28:21,840 --> 00:28:25,120
are controversial i can say

796
00:28:25,120 --> 00:28:28,320
uh like i have a one i have question

797
00:28:28,320 --> 00:28:30,640
uh you one of the myths it's the second

798
00:28:30,640 --> 00:28:32,000
one i think says like

799
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:35,840
uh if you focus your effort

800
00:28:35,840 --> 00:28:39,200
on implementing uh best practices

801
00:28:39,200 --> 00:28:44,320
and uh and run books you're not uh

802
00:28:44,320 --> 00:28:47,919
helping making the system more reliable

803
00:28:47,919 --> 00:28:50,880
but uh in my experience uh if you have

804
00:28:50,880 --> 00:28:51,520
these uh

805
00:28:51,520 --> 00:28:55,600
run books and best practices it also

806
00:28:55,600 --> 00:28:59,039
makes it easier for a junior engineers

807
00:28:59,039 --> 00:29:00,950
to get onto the team

808
00:29:00,950 --> 00:29:02,080
[Music]

809
00:29:02,080 --> 00:29:05,440
so isn't it really like not really a

810
00:29:05,440 --> 00:29:06,880
black and white

811
00:29:06,880 --> 00:29:09,440
situation that you still need to have

812
00:29:09,440 --> 00:29:10,480
some of them

813
00:29:10,480 --> 00:29:13,360
but it should not be the main goal of

814
00:29:13,360 --> 00:29:14,159
the

815
00:29:14,159 --> 00:29:17,600
of the team sure so like i said it's

816
00:29:17,600 --> 00:29:20,640
i'm not saying don't document things um

817
00:29:20,640 --> 00:29:23,120
and it's a great way to communicate to

818
00:29:23,120 --> 00:29:24,720
other people how to come on the team

819
00:29:24,720 --> 00:29:26,080
sure that's part of their their

820
00:29:26,080 --> 00:29:28,080
education but as a

821
00:29:28,080 --> 00:29:30,480
as a an effort to improve the

822
00:29:30,480 --> 00:29:32,640
reliability of your system

823
00:29:32,640 --> 00:29:34,720
if you see somebody say you know what we

824
00:29:34,720 --> 00:29:37,120
keep having outages we need to really

825
00:29:37,120 --> 00:29:40,159
uh invest double down on run books

826
00:29:40,159 --> 00:29:43,520
um and and our documentation that's not

827
00:29:43,520 --> 00:29:44,399
going to move

828
00:29:44,399 --> 00:29:47,520
the needle uh there's there's if you're

829
00:29:47,520 --> 00:29:49,279
if you have that kind of time

830
00:29:49,279 --> 00:29:52,640
and energy to invest in uh

831
00:29:52,640 --> 00:29:55,600
in resources to improve availability to

832
00:29:55,600 --> 00:29:57,600
improve the reliability of the system to

833
00:29:57,600 --> 00:29:59,360
improve security

834
00:29:59,360 --> 00:30:02,320
don't spend that energy on run books and

835
00:30:02,320 --> 00:30:03,440
and

836
00:30:03,440 --> 00:30:06,880
and documentation instead spend it on

837
00:30:06,880 --> 00:30:10,399
collaborative exercises to

838
00:30:10,399 --> 00:30:12,640
to figure out what the safety margin of

839
00:30:12,640 --> 00:30:13,840
the system actually

840
00:30:13,840 --> 00:30:17,120
is there are much much better ways to

841
00:30:17,120 --> 00:30:18,399
educate people

842
00:30:18,399 --> 00:30:22,320
and the skill sets required to be

843
00:30:22,320 --> 00:30:25,520
to improvise during an incident are

844
00:30:25,520 --> 00:30:27,039
skill sets that can't be

845
00:30:27,039 --> 00:30:29,039
translated that can't be transferred to

846
00:30:29,039 --> 00:30:31,760
another human through documentation

847
00:30:31,760 --> 00:30:35,039
they have to be experienced so

848
00:30:35,039 --> 00:30:38,080
whether in a simulation or in in uh

849
00:30:38,080 --> 00:30:39,760
in conversation or some other

850
00:30:39,760 --> 00:30:41,520
interaction with humans you have to

851
00:30:41,520 --> 00:30:44,559
