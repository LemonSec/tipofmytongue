1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:02,970
there we go hey how you doing today get

2
00:00:02,970 --> 00:00:06,450
my carry out then great so I take it you

3
00:00:06,450 --> 00:00:08,340
you're gonna come on and talk to us

4
00:00:08,340 --> 00:00:11,550
about this of ops insecurity and chaos

5
00:00:11,550 --> 00:00:15,000
engineering you got it okay well I'll

6
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:17,850
let you take the floor and all bow and

7
00:00:17,850 --> 00:00:21,410
go ahead if you want to share the screen

8
00:00:27,920 --> 00:00:30,359
yeah we go

9
00:00:30,359 --> 00:00:35,040
all right great thanks it started thank

10
00:00:35,040 --> 00:00:36,239
you everyone for having me I'd like to

11
00:00:36,239 --> 00:00:41,070
thank Patrick Dubois and all the crew at

12
00:00:41,070 --> 00:00:45,809
all the talks online the super 8 events

13
00:00:45,809 --> 00:00:46,920
I've never seen it I don't think I've

14
00:00:46,920 --> 00:00:48,629
ever seen a greater byte of speakers

15
00:00:48,629 --> 00:00:52,550
then now and make sure to stay tuned to

16
00:00:52,550 --> 00:00:56,190
Cooney pigs talk after mine as well as

17
00:00:56,190 --> 00:00:57,360
just gonna be there just gonna be this

18
00:00:57,360 --> 00:00:59,730
will be more uh more in depth of mine a

19
00:00:59,730 --> 00:01:01,590
lot of these concepts well that's I'll

20
00:01:01,590 --> 00:01:03,750
be I'll be there watching that talk so I

21
00:01:03,750 --> 00:01:05,430
would that probably do I'll get started

22
00:01:05,430 --> 00:01:09,780
on my concepts of applying deficit cops

23
00:01:09,780 --> 00:01:13,260
to chaos engineering on this session I

24
00:01:13,260 --> 00:01:14,760
will cover a lot of things pretty

25
00:01:14,760 --> 00:01:16,710
quickly I've given this talk in the

26
00:01:16,710 --> 00:01:18,479
shorter amount of time but I think we'll

27
00:01:18,479 --> 00:01:20,520
be able to cover the material this

28
00:01:20,520 --> 00:01:23,220
amount of time so areas I'm going to

29
00:01:23,220 --> 00:01:24,150
talk about I'm gonna talk about

30
00:01:24,150 --> 00:01:26,430
combating complexity and software I'm

31
00:01:26,430 --> 00:01:27,570
gonna talk a little bit about chaos

32
00:01:27,570 --> 00:01:29,670
engineering I'm gonna briefly touch on

33
00:01:29,670 --> 00:01:31,110
resilience engineering which is what

34
00:01:31,110 --> 00:01:34,110
chaos engineering is a part of terms of

35
00:01:34,110 --> 00:01:35,520
software I'm gonna talk about how both

36
00:01:35,520 --> 00:01:38,759
things apply to cybersecurity I'm also

37
00:01:38,759 --> 00:01:40,740
going to talk about what is security

38
00:01:40,740 --> 00:01:44,040
chaos engineering little bit about me I

39
00:01:44,040 --> 00:01:47,299
am the CTO and co-founder of Erika Erika

40
00:01:47,299 --> 00:01:49,229
I co-founded

41
00:01:49,229 --> 00:01:51,210
Erika with Casey Rosenthal the creator

42
00:01:51,210 --> 00:01:54,180
of PS engineering and Netflix prior to

43
00:01:54,180 --> 00:01:56,640
that I was the former chief security

44
00:01:56,640 --> 00:01:58,740
architect at United Health Group former

45
00:01:58,740 --> 00:02:03,630
DoD and NASA as well as well as I'm a

46
00:02:03,630 --> 00:02:04,950
frequent speaker on the chaos

47
00:02:04,950 --> 00:02:06,600
engineering space

48
00:02:06,600 --> 00:02:09,628
I'm the o'reilly author of the security

49
00:02:09,628 --> 00:02:11,910
chaos engineering chapter or in this

50
00:02:11,910 --> 00:02:12,900
book

51
00:02:12,900 --> 00:02:17,069
a little bit as well as I'm I will be

52
00:02:17,069 --> 00:02:19,470
releasing a Riley book on security chaos

53
00:02:19,470 --> 00:02:23,040
engineering in June um so yeah let's get

54
00:02:23,040 --> 00:02:25,709
started here oh I'd also led the chaos

55
00:02:25,709 --> 00:02:27,269
linearity meet United Health Group which

56
00:02:27,269 --> 00:02:28,799
I'm gonna talk about in my slides

57
00:02:28,799 --> 00:02:31,140
Kessinger was the first-ever application

58
00:02:31,140 --> 00:02:33,360
of Netflix's chaos engineering to cyber

59
00:02:33,360 --> 00:02:36,900
security and will give in to that so

60
00:02:36,900 --> 00:02:38,790
what is the crux of the problem the crux

61
00:02:38,790 --> 00:02:40,230
of the problem is that incident outages

62
00:02:40,230 --> 00:02:42,510
and breaches are costly and they seem to

63
00:02:42,510 --> 00:02:44,280
be happening more often it's kind of the

64
00:02:44,280 --> 00:02:47,879
the crux of the issue here it's you know

65
00:02:47,879 --> 00:02:50,700
it's just about any day you can you can

66
00:02:50,700 --> 00:02:52,680
pull up the news and find a massive

67
00:02:52,680 --> 00:02:54,840
outages especially and you know we're

68
00:02:54,840 --> 00:02:56,340
currently with this Cove it's a

69
00:02:56,340 --> 00:02:58,590
situation we've never seen technology

70
00:02:58,590 --> 00:03:01,079
being stretched a little bit Siddhas

71
00:03:01,079 --> 00:03:03,540
being stressed at now so outages are

72
00:03:03,540 --> 00:03:05,159
becoming in norm and they were already

73
00:03:05,159 --> 00:03:08,459
becoming a norm before that so why is it

74
00:03:08,459 --> 00:03:10,379
do they seem to be happy more often I'm

75
00:03:10,379 --> 00:03:13,349
gonna give a few opinionated answers to

76
00:03:13,349 --> 00:03:15,930
this problem I believe but also they're

77
00:03:15,930 --> 00:03:19,859
grounded in research that I've done it

78
00:03:19,859 --> 00:03:21,419
all starts with combating complexity and

79
00:03:21,419 --> 00:03:23,370
software the complexity and weirdness

80
00:03:23,370 --> 00:03:26,519
flexing come from in software so Sidney

81
00:03:26,519 --> 00:03:28,410
Dekker is will the foremost authorities

82
00:03:28,410 --> 00:03:30,930
in the world on safety engineering

83
00:03:30,930 --> 00:03:32,579
especially in terms of accident

84
00:03:32,579 --> 00:03:34,620
mitigations I wrote a couple great book

85
00:03:34,620 --> 00:03:36,569
script in a failure feel guide the

86
00:03:36,569 --> 00:03:37,859
investigative human error those are

87
00:03:37,859 --> 00:03:39,419
great books to read

88
00:03:39,419 --> 00:03:41,669
it'll fundamentally blow your mind and

89
00:03:41,669 --> 00:03:43,319
what's funny is they're not even written

90
00:03:43,319 --> 00:03:45,510
about software but like you can directly

91
00:03:45,510 --> 00:03:48,000
apply them to what we do but he likes to

92
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:49,620
say that the growth of complexity in

93
00:03:49,620 --> 00:03:51,690
society has gotten ahead of our

94
00:03:51,690 --> 00:03:53,730
understanding of how complex systems

95
00:03:53,730 --> 00:03:56,129
work and fail so complex systems are a

96
00:03:56,129 --> 00:03:57,810
term and Applied Sciences right it

97
00:03:57,810 --> 00:03:59,280
doesn't mean a complicated or complex

98
00:03:59,280 --> 00:04:01,889
system as our system that's complex

99
00:04:01,889 --> 00:04:03,750
right it's it had may have certain

100
00:04:03,750 --> 00:04:06,500
characteristics meaning out of the

101
00:04:06,500 --> 00:04:08,699
operations of a complex system you have

102
00:04:08,699 --> 00:04:10,590
emergent behavior unpredictable behavior

103
00:04:10,590 --> 00:04:13,019
a human cannot mentally model its

104
00:04:13,019 --> 00:04:15,840
behavior it's impossible to diagram a

105
00:04:15,840 --> 00:04:17,699
model a complex system the way you

106
00:04:17,699 --> 00:04:19,289
understand it is by interacting with it

107
00:04:19,289 --> 00:04:23,209
I'll expand on these concepts so further

108
00:04:23,930 --> 00:04:26,010
so if you haven't never seen these

109
00:04:26,010 --> 00:04:26,639
diagrams

110
00:04:26,639 --> 00:04:27,840
for here these are called the death star

111
00:04:27,840 --> 00:04:30,509
diagrams but it used to be those just

112
00:04:30,509 --> 00:04:32,189
Netflix Amazon Facebook the fame

113
00:04:32,189 --> 00:04:34,050
companies that were developing systems

114
00:04:34,050 --> 00:04:36,479
that look like this meaning that every

115
00:04:36,479 --> 00:04:39,689
dot you see in the best star diagrams

116
00:04:39,689 --> 00:04:44,699
here are micro services but the problem

117
00:04:44,699 --> 00:04:45,840
with this is that our systems have

118
00:04:45,840 --> 00:04:48,270
evolved beyond our human ability to

119
00:04:48,270 --> 00:04:51,539
mentally model their behavior and what's

120
00:04:51,539 --> 00:04:52,830
happening now is everyone is now

121
00:04:52,830 --> 00:04:54,810
building systems that look like this

122
00:04:54,810 --> 00:04:56,939
and what this brings a whole new kind of

123
00:04:56,939 --> 00:04:59,879
problem ok I love showing this is

124
00:04:59,879 --> 00:05:01,020
actually a piece of software from

125
00:05:01,020 --> 00:05:03,210
Netflix called visceral the originally

126
00:05:03,210 --> 00:05:05,610
called like flux I think but I love

127
00:05:05,610 --> 00:05:07,439
showing it because it shows this is a

128
00:05:07,439 --> 00:05:09,389
brief snippet of micro service

129
00:05:09,389 --> 00:05:11,490
transactions from Netflix well what it

130
00:05:11,490 --> 00:05:14,699
does is it shows kind of like the the

131
00:05:14,699 --> 00:05:17,400
inherit complexity in operating systems

132
00:05:17,400 --> 00:05:21,449
that are are so disparate and how they

133
00:05:21,449 --> 00:05:24,900
communicate in complex and the complex

134
00:05:24,900 --> 00:05:26,550
patterns of which they're they interact

135
00:05:26,550 --> 00:05:29,249
and it's very difficult for a human even

136
00:05:29,249 --> 00:05:31,879
with this small couple of microseconds

137
00:05:31,879 --> 00:05:34,259
snapshot here it's very difficult for a

138
00:05:34,259 --> 00:05:35,969
human to understand what's going on in

139
00:05:35,969 --> 00:05:39,270
any given point of this you know this

140
00:05:39,270 --> 00:05:41,460
the system and that's the nature of the

141
00:05:41,460 --> 00:05:43,139
problem is that the speed scale

142
00:05:43,139 --> 00:05:44,969
complexity of our modern systems are

143
00:05:44,969 --> 00:05:47,879
make it very difficult to to understand

144
00:05:47,879 --> 00:05:50,069
them let alone continuously change and

145
00:05:50,069 --> 00:05:52,889
operate them so what is its complexity

146
00:05:52,889 --> 00:05:55,589
come from right I mean so we are now um

147
00:05:55,589 --> 00:05:57,779
so I'll talk a bit about what the nature

148
00:05:57,779 --> 00:06:00,089
of complexity of software but the all

149
00:06:00,089 --> 00:06:01,589
these techniques you see up on the

150
00:06:01,589 --> 00:06:03,210
screen here are for everything from

151
00:06:03,210 --> 00:06:04,649
micro service architectures cloud

152
00:06:04,649 --> 00:06:07,259
computing immutable infrastructure like

153
00:06:07,259 --> 00:06:08,939
your die distributed mutable and

154
00:06:08,939 --> 00:06:11,370
ephemeral are your Auto Canaries all

155
00:06:11,370 --> 00:06:13,199
these technologies are directly related

156
00:06:13,199 --> 00:06:15,210
to delivering value faster to customer

157
00:06:15,210 --> 00:06:17,250
but what if they're also directly

158
00:06:17,250 --> 00:06:19,800
contributing to making our systems more

159
00:06:19,800 --> 00:06:24,180
complex for humans to understand but the

160
00:06:24,180 --> 00:06:26,099
state of security is still mostly how we

161
00:06:26,099 --> 00:06:28,050
security mostly approaches engineering

162
00:06:28,050 --> 00:06:29,789
is still we're still mostly want to lift

163
00:06:29,789 --> 00:06:31,099
think and how we approach solutioning

164
00:06:31,099 --> 00:06:33,509
we're pulling poorly line in terms of

165
00:06:33,509 --> 00:06:35,759
how we address solutions and software a

166
00:06:35,759 --> 00:06:38,190
lot of the the approach to security is

167
00:06:38,190 --> 00:06:40,370
still staple in nature

168
00:06:40,370 --> 00:06:43,250
and requires it's in what I mean by

169
00:06:43,250 --> 00:06:46,100
expert systems is that they require

170
00:06:46,100 --> 00:06:49,400
domain knowledge is that you can't just

171
00:06:49,400 --> 00:06:51,080
pick up a pile out the firewall and

172
00:06:51,080 --> 00:06:52,790
start working with it I mean it's not

173
00:06:52,790 --> 00:06:54,830
like it's a lot though it's just like

174
00:06:54,830 --> 00:06:56,960
it's requires some kind of training or

175
00:06:56,960 --> 00:07:00,410
expertise or you know to work with it

176
00:07:00,410 --> 00:07:02,900
versus word I software generic can

177
00:07:02,900 --> 00:07:04,820
easily pick up something from get up and

178
00:07:04,820 --> 00:07:06,680
start working with new tools and

179
00:07:06,680 --> 00:07:10,070
capabilities so what is the answer to

180
00:07:10,070 --> 00:07:12,290
complexity I mean the most logical

181
00:07:12,290 --> 00:07:14,000
common-sense response would be to

182
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:17,330
simplify well unfortunately software is

183
00:07:17,330 --> 00:07:19,510
officially taken over the stack and

184
00:07:19,510 --> 00:07:22,790
complexity complexity is inherent in how

185
00:07:22,790 --> 00:07:24,139
we build software

186
00:07:24,139 --> 00:07:27,910
yeah that's newest I stack you see

187
00:07:27,910 --> 00:07:30,620
software only ever increases a complete

188
00:07:30,620 --> 00:07:33,380
complexity there is an old saying in

189
00:07:33,380 --> 00:07:35,360
software that there's no no problem and

190
00:07:35,360 --> 00:07:36,710
software that can't be solved - another

191
00:07:36,710 --> 00:07:38,510
way of abstraction but at some point

192
00:07:38,510 --> 00:07:42,080
that abstraction starts to break and I'm

193
00:07:42,080 --> 00:07:43,850
gonna experience on that so software

194
00:07:43,850 --> 00:07:45,260
complexity we're just complexity and

195
00:07:45,260 --> 00:07:46,580
software coming from there's well

196
00:07:46,580 --> 00:07:47,930
there's a there's a paper written I

197
00:07:47,930 --> 00:07:50,630
think it was in the 1980s called no

198
00:07:50,630 --> 00:07:52,550
silver bullet it explains the different

199
00:07:52,550 --> 00:07:54,190
work complexity comes from in software

200
00:07:54,190 --> 00:07:56,240
there's a central complexity in

201
00:07:56,240 --> 00:07:58,130
accidental complexity essential

202
00:07:58,130 --> 00:08:01,070
complexity comes from you know things

203
00:08:01,070 --> 00:08:02,539
like Conway's law the states that

204
00:08:02,539 --> 00:08:04,190
organizations are destined to design

205
00:08:04,190 --> 00:08:05,960
computer system to reflect the way they

206
00:08:05,960 --> 00:08:07,639
communicate well you know a certain

207
00:08:07,639 --> 00:08:09,050
company can really see certain

208
00:08:09,050 --> 00:08:10,310
communities a certain way because that's

209
00:08:10,310 --> 00:08:13,250
a reflection of how they operate and

210
00:08:13,250 --> 00:08:15,139
deliver value to customers so it's hard

211
00:08:15,139 --> 00:08:17,090
to change a software with that change in

212
00:08:17,090 --> 00:08:19,160
the nature of the business so we kind of

213
00:08:19,160 --> 00:08:20,270
inherited that through through the

214
00:08:20,270 --> 00:08:22,150
systems and software that you built

215
00:08:22,150 --> 00:08:24,169
accidental there's just two theories on

216
00:08:24,169 --> 00:08:26,060
accidental complexity but Excel

217
00:08:26,060 --> 00:08:28,039
complexity comes through how we choose

218
00:08:28,039 --> 00:08:30,650
to build the software and there's

219
00:08:30,650 --> 00:08:32,360
certain two camps on this some people

220
00:08:32,360 --> 00:08:34,370
believe you can you can reduce accent

221
00:08:34,370 --> 00:08:36,440
okay plexus II other folks believe

222
00:08:36,440 --> 00:08:38,240
you're just moving it around but really

223
00:08:38,240 --> 00:08:39,770
the answer is not reducing it it's

224
00:08:39,770 --> 00:08:41,990
actually navigating and I'm like I'm

225
00:08:41,990 --> 00:08:43,339
explaining how PS engineering helps us

226
00:08:43,339 --> 00:08:46,400
with that dr. David woods is one of the

227
00:08:46,400 --> 00:08:47,300
world's foremost authorities on

228
00:08:47,300 --> 00:08:50,089
resilience engineering in medicine I'd I

229
00:08:50,089 --> 00:08:52,190
love reading all dr. David Wood stuff as

230
00:08:52,190 --> 00:08:53,870
well as Richard cook and

231
00:08:53,870 --> 00:08:56,330
other folks in the space is that you

232
00:08:56,330 --> 00:08:57,860
could actually just take the look you

233
00:08:57,860 --> 00:09:00,350
didn't actually just read it and it kind

234
00:09:00,350 --> 00:09:01,850
of makes sense in terms of software so

235
00:09:01,850 --> 00:09:04,070
Woods theorem is that as the complexity

236
00:09:04,070 --> 00:09:06,440
system increases the accuracy of any

237
00:09:06,440 --> 00:09:08,900
single agent meaning our human humans

238
00:09:08,900 --> 00:09:11,360
own model of that system decreases so as

239
00:09:11,360 --> 00:09:13,490
it sub becomes more more complex it's

240
00:09:13,490 --> 00:09:16,130
more difficult for us to model how it

241
00:09:16,130 --> 00:09:19,190
works in our head so what does all this

242
00:09:19,190 --> 00:09:20,720
have to do with our systems and how we

243
00:09:20,720 --> 00:09:23,839
build things well how well I mean how

244
00:09:23,839 --> 00:09:25,730
well do you really understand the

245
00:09:25,730 --> 00:09:27,920
systems that you built I'm going to

246
00:09:27,920 --> 00:09:31,700
posit that question okay the John Ellis

247
00:09:31,700 --> 00:09:35,089
ball likes to say that real work is

248
00:09:35,089 --> 00:09:37,070
messy right it's just an engineering

249
00:09:37,070 --> 00:09:38,660
it's really messy we kind of forget that

250
00:09:38,660 --> 00:09:40,190
you know I'm gonna explain kind of what

251
00:09:40,190 --> 00:09:43,400
I mean by that but so individual so I

252
00:09:43,400 --> 00:09:45,110
used to be I've spent a good portion of

253
00:09:45,110 --> 00:09:47,000
my career as an architect after I got in

254
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:48,860
security and then you know we love to

255
00:09:48,860 --> 00:09:51,230
think that I care the way we approach

256
00:09:51,230 --> 00:09:52,640
building things is like oh that's

257
00:09:52,640 --> 00:09:54,230
niiiiice plan we've got resources but

258
00:09:54,230 --> 00:09:55,850
you know we're gonna you know we got

259
00:09:55,850 --> 00:09:57,500
three steps and we're gonna be there and

260
00:09:57,500 --> 00:10:00,710
we got a nice 3d diagram you know that

261
00:10:00,710 --> 00:10:03,740
looks pretty cool right we got code we

262
00:10:03,740 --> 00:10:05,570
do kind of think we know what's going on

263
00:10:05,570 --> 00:10:07,640
right so we go forth we build and we

264
00:10:07,640 --> 00:10:10,370
deliver right but what happens so what

265
00:10:10,370 --> 00:10:12,440
happens is after a few months right is

266
00:10:12,440 --> 00:10:15,320
that our systems our systems slowly

267
00:10:15,320 --> 00:10:17,630
evolved to a state of unknown and what

268
00:10:17,630 --> 00:10:19,130
do I mean with it but I mean by that is

269
00:10:19,130 --> 00:10:20,690
so after a few months are you sometimes

270
00:10:20,690 --> 00:10:22,580
after new weeks have to be that we go

271
00:10:22,580 --> 00:10:24,980
live is that you know there's a there's

272
00:10:24,980 --> 00:10:26,780
a there's an outage on the payments API

273
00:10:26,780 --> 00:10:28,520
we have to hard code of token or our

274
00:10:28,520 --> 00:10:30,680
Google hires are of no offense to Google

275
00:10:30,680 --> 00:10:32,660
but let's say if somebody hires your

276
00:10:32,660 --> 00:10:34,280
best self for engineering if somebody

277
00:10:34,280 --> 00:10:36,110
else new comes in or you have an expired

278
00:10:36,110 --> 00:10:38,209
certificate or marketing comes down and

279
00:10:38,209 --> 00:10:40,520
says we got the pricing model wrong we

280
00:10:40,520 --> 00:10:42,950
got a refactor right it's it's our

281
00:10:42,950 --> 00:10:44,900
system slowly through a series of

282
00:10:44,900 --> 00:10:47,620
unforeseen events our system slowly

283
00:10:47,620 --> 00:10:50,839
drift beyond our understanding and this

284
00:10:50,839 --> 00:10:53,390
is what I mean by that this I believe is

285
00:10:53,390 --> 00:10:57,260
also part of what contributes to the

286
00:10:57,260 --> 00:10:59,000
number of outages and instance we're

287
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:00,740
seeing is that you know with the

288
00:11:00,740 --> 00:11:02,570
complexity size and scale and speed

289
00:11:02,570 --> 00:11:04,640
they're now delivering it these kind of

290
00:11:04,640 --> 00:11:06,440
unforeseen events are more more

291
00:11:06,440 --> 00:11:07,550
difficult to navigate

292
00:11:07,550 --> 00:11:10,760
eat and understand after years it just

293
00:11:10,760 --> 00:11:13,990
kind of grows and grows and grows and

294
00:11:13,990 --> 00:11:16,760
that each of the the point I'm trying to

295
00:11:16,760 --> 00:11:18,290
make here is that our systems become

296
00:11:18,290 --> 00:11:20,690
more have become more complex that we

297
00:11:20,690 --> 00:11:23,690
remember that remember this is very

298
00:11:23,690 --> 00:11:26,390
difficult for a human to mentally model

299
00:11:26,390 --> 00:11:30,370
any any point in this operational state

300
00:11:30,370 --> 00:11:32,810
so what does all this stuff have to do

301
00:11:32,810 --> 00:11:35,029
with security okay like this is security

302
00:11:35,029 --> 00:11:38,839
talk right well the finger happens a lot

303
00:11:38,839 --> 00:11:42,410
right you know and it's a bigger is the

304
00:11:42,410 --> 00:11:46,250
normal state of a system it's nice I

305
00:11:46,250 --> 00:11:49,579
didn't hear the says that that no system

306
00:11:49,579 --> 00:11:51,440
is safe for secure by default it takes a

307
00:11:51,440 --> 00:11:53,450
human to create it and it's like you

308
00:11:53,450 --> 00:11:55,700
know we we have a responsibility you

309
00:11:55,700 --> 00:11:57,829
know the level that society depends on

310
00:11:57,829 --> 00:12:01,010
technology it's never been more more

311
00:12:01,010 --> 00:12:02,810
apparent than the given situation right

312
00:12:02,810 --> 00:12:05,720
now but um we have responsibilities

313
00:12:05,720 --> 00:12:08,600
engineers to ensure that you know we

314
00:12:08,600 --> 00:12:10,910
build highly reliable secure performance

315
00:12:10,910 --> 00:12:14,959
systems so that we won't depend on so

316
00:12:14,959 --> 00:12:17,120
the normal condition is to fail okay

317
00:12:17,120 --> 00:12:18,860
that is the normal condition it's humans

318
00:12:18,860 --> 00:12:22,610
it's our ability to improvisation it's

319
00:12:22,610 --> 00:12:25,339
our ability to respond and keep the

320
00:12:25,339 --> 00:12:26,990
system's going is what creates

321
00:12:26,990 --> 00:12:31,430
resilience we we as humans we need

322
00:12:31,430 --> 00:12:34,040
failure to learn and grow the things we

323
00:12:34,040 --> 00:12:37,579
build are no different things that was

324
00:12:37,579 --> 00:12:39,230
so I love this scope from Scott Sagan I

325
00:12:39,230 --> 00:12:41,630
got this one it's almost ball slides is

326
00:12:41,630 --> 00:12:44,750
that what we think would never would've

327
00:12:44,750 --> 00:12:46,190
never happen seems to happen all the

328
00:12:46,190 --> 00:12:49,220
time and you know that's it's very it's

329
00:12:49,220 --> 00:12:51,620
it's kind of the truth is that like if

330
00:12:51,620 --> 00:12:54,529
you would have thought that you know an

331
00:12:54,529 --> 00:12:57,050
ounce are sometimes really up so now

332
00:12:57,050 --> 00:12:58,459
this was gonna happen you would have

333
00:12:58,459 --> 00:12:59,930
fixed it before it caused the outage

334
00:12:59,930 --> 00:13:03,620
right so how do we typically discover

335
00:13:03,620 --> 00:13:05,980
what security measures fail well

336
00:13:05,980 --> 00:13:08,149
unfortunately it's typically through

337
00:13:08,149 --> 00:13:10,519
security incidents is that we that's

338
00:13:10,519 --> 00:13:12,589
kind of how we found out oh wow it

339
00:13:12,589 --> 00:13:15,589
didn't work but the problem with this is

340
00:13:15,589 --> 00:13:18,140
it's too late about its timely why we

341
00:13:18,140 --> 00:13:19,640
timely detect it and we launched an

342
00:13:19,640 --> 00:13:20,660
incident

343
00:13:20,660 --> 00:13:23,170
the damage might have already been that

344
00:13:23,170 --> 00:13:26,420
so a lot of times security incidents are

345
00:13:26,420 --> 00:13:29,930
driven through a bit what I put a lot of

346
00:13:29,930 --> 00:13:31,699
all John I'll spa but I learned a lot

347
00:13:31,699 --> 00:13:33,050
about resilience engineering through a

348
00:13:33,050 --> 00:13:35,389
lot of the things that he taught me but

349
00:13:35,389 --> 00:13:37,790
um is that Bennett what I mean by

350
00:13:37,790 --> 00:13:39,410
banishing traces is a lot of it students

351
00:13:39,410 --> 00:13:41,060
are launched through like log events

352
00:13:41,060 --> 00:13:43,939
alerts and you know but those are just

353
00:13:43,939 --> 00:13:47,000
footsteps in the sand right like what

354
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:48,769
about all the log event I love there's a

355
00:13:48,769 --> 00:13:49,910
lot there's a lot of security vendors

356
00:13:49,910 --> 00:13:51,079
out there will tell you that they could

357
00:13:51,079 --> 00:13:53,120
ingest all your all your long data and

358
00:13:53,120 --> 00:13:54,470
then they can predict what's going to

359
00:13:54,470 --> 00:13:56,660
happen in the future well what about all

360
00:13:56,660 --> 00:13:59,180
the log data was never written I mean so

361
00:13:59,180 --> 00:14:01,730
software engineers are required it's in

362
00:14:01,730 --> 00:14:03,860
order to have a log event it takes a

363
00:14:03,860 --> 00:14:05,420
software engineer to write it to throw

364
00:14:05,420 --> 00:14:08,209
them throw their back and but what about

365
00:14:08,209 --> 00:14:09,740
all the log events that were never

366
00:14:09,740 --> 00:14:11,329
written I mean as a software engineer

367
00:14:11,329 --> 00:14:13,310
I never a prioritized prioritize

368
00:14:13,310 --> 00:14:14,990
features of functions over arguments

369
00:14:14,990 --> 00:14:17,060
right so it's important understand about

370
00:14:17,060 --> 00:14:18,829
all the events that we don't have and

371
00:14:18,829 --> 00:14:20,060
that's really what the observability

372
00:14:20,060 --> 00:14:21,860
moment movement is sort of about it's

373
00:14:21,860 --> 00:14:23,750
about you know it's it's about really

374
00:14:23,750 --> 00:14:24,980
trying to better understand how our

375
00:14:24,980 --> 00:14:26,329
system for internally through their

376
00:14:26,329 --> 00:14:31,610
external outputs so security the point

377
00:14:31,610 --> 00:14:32,899
here is that's kriti incidents are not

378
00:14:32,899 --> 00:14:34,550
an effective measure detection because

379
00:14:34,550 --> 00:14:37,699
that point is too late I think I already

380
00:14:37,699 --> 00:14:40,759
mentioned this but a lot of times in

381
00:14:40,759 --> 00:14:42,829
security we see the name blame shame

382
00:14:42,829 --> 00:14:46,189
game around human error and the humans

383
00:14:46,189 --> 00:14:47,000
are the fault

384
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:50,720
fishing has been a huge boon to that to

385
00:14:50,720 --> 00:14:53,930
that that angle on things but it's it's

386
00:14:53,930 --> 00:14:55,189
actually humans they're the ones that

387
00:14:55,189 --> 00:14:57,380
create the security so to point to

388
00:14:57,380 --> 00:14:59,779
humans is the problem is is is never

389
00:14:59,779 --> 00:15:02,350
going to solve anything

390
00:15:02,350 --> 00:15:05,600
so it's important to recognize this

391
00:15:05,600 --> 00:15:06,649
we're sort of getting the chaos

392
00:15:06,649 --> 00:15:07,819
engineering stuff here is important to

393
00:15:07,819 --> 00:15:09,050
recognize that people operate

394
00:15:09,050 --> 00:15:11,720
differently when they expect things in

395
00:15:11,720 --> 00:15:14,240
the film okay so learn normally during

396
00:15:14,240 --> 00:15:15,920
this intern outage this is what happens

397
00:15:15,920 --> 00:15:18,769
people freak out okay and you know us

398
00:15:18,769 --> 00:15:20,089
maybe the security incident response

399
00:15:20,089 --> 00:15:22,550
team may not be freaking out because

400
00:15:22,550 --> 00:15:23,990
they're used to dealing with it but if

401
00:15:23,990 --> 00:15:25,459
your software's you know you're worried

402
00:15:25,459 --> 00:15:26,990
that like oh man I know I should have

403
00:15:26,990 --> 00:15:28,790
pushed that code or you're concerned

404
00:15:28,790 --> 00:15:31,160
that this could be you're gonna get

405
00:15:31,160 --> 00:15:32,499
blamed for for what

406
00:15:32,499 --> 00:15:34,509
this could be the breach and this is

407
00:15:34,509 --> 00:15:36,909
this here is not a very good learning

408
00:15:36,909 --> 00:15:39,219
environment like when people because it

409
00:15:39,219 --> 00:15:40,779
means within 15 to 20 minutes of

410
00:15:40,779 --> 00:15:43,569
administer knowledge CEO is the call

411
00:15:43,569 --> 00:15:45,519
centers overloaded CEO is asking

412
00:15:45,519 --> 00:15:46,929
questions I get that thing back up and

413
00:15:46,929 --> 00:15:48,939
running we're losing money as a company

414
00:15:48,939 --> 00:15:53,979
and anyway that's that's it's not a very

415
00:15:53,979 --> 00:15:58,239
good environment for learning but so we

416
00:15:58,239 --> 00:16:00,189
don't do chaos engineering here okay

417
00:16:00,189 --> 00:16:02,439
this is this is we do chaos engineering

418
00:16:02,439 --> 00:16:04,209
here and what I mean by that is that

419
00:16:04,209 --> 00:16:06,069
like there is no outage nothing's

420
00:16:06,069 --> 00:16:08,889
burning the there's no outages of these

421
00:16:08,889 --> 00:16:10,659
burning the things nobody's freaking out

422
00:16:10,659 --> 00:16:13,749
we proactively learn about our system

423
00:16:13,749 --> 00:16:16,979
and its failure before it causes pain

424
00:16:16,979 --> 00:16:19,929
I'm gonna expand on this so what is

425
00:16:19,929 --> 00:16:22,149
chaos engineering and a lot of people

426
00:16:22,149 --> 00:16:23,199
will be talking about this today and

427
00:16:23,199 --> 00:16:24,639
different angles and I'm just gonna

428
00:16:24,639 --> 00:16:27,099
cover it again as that chaos engineering

429
00:16:27,099 --> 00:16:28,779
is the discipline of experimentation

430
00:16:28,779 --> 00:16:31,239
honest tributed systems order build

431
00:16:31,239 --> 00:16:33,309
build confidence in the system's ability

432
00:16:33,309 --> 00:16:35,439
withstand turbulent conditions another

433
00:16:35,439 --> 00:16:36,879
way I like to describe it is it's the

434
00:16:36,879 --> 00:16:38,470
idea of proactively introducing

435
00:16:38,470 --> 00:16:40,749
turbulent conditions into a system or

436
00:16:40,749 --> 00:16:42,489
service to try to determine the

437
00:16:42,489 --> 00:16:44,919
conditions by which it will fail before

438
00:16:44,919 --> 00:16:46,869
it actually does it's it's a learning

439
00:16:46,869 --> 00:16:48,759
exercise way for us to surface failure

440
00:16:48,759 --> 00:16:51,099
fix things in production it's not about

441
00:16:51,099 --> 00:16:52,329
breaking things to production is about

442
00:16:52,329 --> 00:16:55,389
fixing them so there are a number of

443
00:16:55,389 --> 00:16:57,459
companies I've tracking about fifteen

444
00:16:57,459 --> 00:16:58,720
hundred companies now doing chaos

445
00:16:58,720 --> 00:17:02,139
engineering it's this is wide wide

446
00:17:02,139 --> 00:17:05,559
varieties of maturity but it really

447
00:17:05,559 --> 00:17:08,529
began a Netflix I almost began a other

448
00:17:08,529 --> 00:17:10,269
other fame companies but Netflix is

449
00:17:10,269 --> 00:17:13,559
really the place where it became a thing

450
00:17:13,559 --> 00:17:16,089
Prince principles of chaos that work is

451
00:17:16,089 --> 00:17:17,799
very very important to take this down

452
00:17:17,799 --> 00:17:20,049
all these slides will be sure later but

453
00:17:20,049 --> 00:17:22,569
this is sort of the rulebook through the

454
00:17:22,569 --> 00:17:26,019
guidelines that you follow so there are

455
00:17:26,019 --> 00:17:27,789
now two books on chaos engineering okay

456
00:17:27,789 --> 00:17:29,320
I mentioned before I've been to briefly

457
00:17:29,320 --> 00:17:32,320
mentioned a Netflix wrote original cast

458
00:17:32,320 --> 00:17:34,869
engineering report for O'Reilly there

459
00:17:34,869 --> 00:17:36,580
was about 70 pages now we've just

460
00:17:36,580 --> 00:17:40,360
released a full book honorable book on

461
00:17:40,360 --> 00:17:42,580
PS engineering you find it on Amazon as

462
00:17:42,580 --> 00:17:45,159
well as I've got a slide at the end here

463
00:17:45,159 --> 00:17:45,800
that has of Lee

464
00:17:45,800 --> 00:17:51,980
to get a copy of a free one mil - so

465
00:17:51,980 --> 00:17:54,350
chaos is used to establish order it's

466
00:17:54,350 --> 00:17:56,770
not it's not about the you know

467
00:17:56,770 --> 00:17:59,420
increasing chaos are just causing

468
00:17:59,420 --> 00:18:01,580
problems in the system we already have

469
00:18:01,580 --> 00:18:04,130
enough of that so I like to break down

470
00:18:04,130 --> 00:18:05,750
chaos engineering I guess

471
00:18:05,750 --> 00:18:08,060
instrumentation into two domains testing

472
00:18:08,060 --> 00:18:10,550
versus experimentation so testing is the

473
00:18:10,550 --> 00:18:11,840
verification or validation of something

474
00:18:11,840 --> 00:18:13,850
already know to be true or false meaning

475
00:18:13,850 --> 00:18:15,830
you know what you looking for before you

476
00:18:15,830 --> 00:18:17,360
go looking for it in our kitchen

477
00:18:17,360 --> 00:18:19,400
security would be a cassini or an attack

478
00:18:19,400 --> 00:18:21,220
pattern our signature whereas

479
00:18:21,220 --> 00:18:22,940
experimentation we're trying to derive

480
00:18:22,940 --> 00:18:24,980
new information and previously did not

481
00:18:24,980 --> 00:18:28,850
know and that's where chaos and generic

482
00:18:28,850 --> 00:18:30,290
shirt fits and we're experimenting on

483
00:18:30,290 --> 00:18:32,300
the system proactively to learn about

484
00:18:32,300 --> 00:18:35,540
its behavior so the chaos monkey story

485
00:18:35,540 --> 00:18:37,070
I'm gonna try to share a few different

486
00:18:37,070 --> 00:18:39,050
things about chaos monkey story so it's

487
00:18:39,050 --> 00:18:41,000
important to recognize here that gas

488
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:43,340
monkeys as a little over 12 years old

489
00:18:43,340 --> 00:18:46,340
now and but gas monkey came out of

490
00:18:46,340 --> 00:18:48,830
Netflix's cloud transformation a lot of

491
00:18:48,830 --> 00:18:51,440
people talk about how okay engineering I

492
00:18:51,440 --> 00:18:53,210
can't even do the DevOps we can't even

493
00:18:53,210 --> 00:18:55,550
you know we can barely get in the cloud

494
00:18:55,550 --> 00:18:57,800
and you know that's just way too

495
00:18:57,800 --> 00:19:00,410
advanced for us well it was I mean

496
00:19:00,410 --> 00:19:02,060
Netflix it was the beginning of their

497
00:19:02,060 --> 00:19:03,800
cloud transformation when they when they

498
00:19:03,800 --> 00:19:06,350
when they spawn the need for chaos

499
00:19:06,350 --> 00:19:10,430
monkey so it's a key way to sort of it

500
00:19:10,430 --> 00:19:12,230
so it's not it's not odd to find

501
00:19:12,230 --> 00:19:14,780
yourself wanting to experiment with us

502
00:19:14,780 --> 00:19:15,830
engineering during a cloud

503
00:19:15,830 --> 00:19:19,010
transformation effort chaos monkey if

504
00:19:19,010 --> 00:19:20,330
you're not familiar with what it is what

505
00:19:20,330 --> 00:19:21,920
it does is proactively during business

506
00:19:21,920 --> 00:19:25,730
hours it will bring down pseudorandomly

507
00:19:25,730 --> 00:19:29,360
bring down an ami in Amazon what that

508
00:19:29,360 --> 00:19:31,730
did was a lot of people think sir just

509
00:19:31,730 --> 00:19:33,380
causing chaos right well what it said

510
00:19:33,380 --> 00:19:35,690
what's what it's really about is Netflix

511
00:19:35,690 --> 00:19:38,230
has no chief architect no no

512
00:19:38,230 --> 00:19:40,880
authoritative arm to force engineers to

513
00:19:40,880 --> 00:19:43,010
do things at least at the time that I

514
00:19:43,010 --> 00:19:45,980
know Casey was there is that it's about

515
00:19:45,980 --> 00:19:47,510
putting a well-defined problem for him

516
00:19:47,510 --> 00:19:50,480
an engineer is that my service can be

517
00:19:50,480 --> 00:19:52,460
exposed to this chaos monkey or it can

518
00:19:52,460 --> 00:19:54,140
be exposed to these kind of problems I

519
00:19:54,140 --> 00:19:56,030
want to design my service to be

520
00:19:56,030 --> 00:19:58,700
resilient to that sort of problem

521
00:19:58,700 --> 00:20:01,100
it was actually the am i superior was

522
00:20:01,100 --> 00:20:02,779
actually a problem Netflix was having

523
00:20:02,779 --> 00:20:05,450
early on with Amazon at the time am i

524
00:20:05,450 --> 00:20:07,970
sir just disappearing

525
00:20:07,970 --> 00:20:10,700
so Casey likes to say that the purpose

526
00:20:10,700 --> 00:20:12,440
of a GPS engineering is not to break

527
00:20:12,440 --> 00:20:14,960
things on purpose if we if we are trying

528
00:20:14,960 --> 00:20:17,619
we're trying to fix them on purpose and

529
00:20:17,619 --> 00:20:19,940
it's also if you also likes to say that

530
00:20:19,940 --> 00:20:21,739
I'm pretty sure I wouldn't have a job or

531
00:20:21,739 --> 00:20:22,999
long if I want to want breaking things

532
00:20:22,999 --> 00:20:26,480
all day so what a security Cass

533
00:20:26,480 --> 00:20:31,039
engineering okay so so I like to refer

534
00:20:31,039 --> 00:20:34,879
to security chaos engineering as secure

535
00:20:34,879 --> 00:20:36,669
as a continuous security verification

536
00:20:36,669 --> 00:20:39,289
okay it's about proactively managing and

537
00:20:39,289 --> 00:20:41,419
measuring how effective our security is

538
00:20:41,419 --> 00:20:42,950
so it's about correcting our mental

539
00:20:42,950 --> 00:20:44,960
model of how we believe our security

540
00:20:44,960 --> 00:20:46,970
works versus how it works in reality and

541
00:20:46,970 --> 00:20:49,129
part because of some of the problems

542
00:20:49,129 --> 00:20:51,730
from a complexity speed and scale and

543
00:20:51,730 --> 00:20:56,690
this caused a bit of difficult for us as

544
00:20:56,690 --> 00:20:59,389
engineers to ensure that security is

545
00:20:59,389 --> 00:21:01,879
always working the way we intended it to

546
00:21:01,879 --> 00:21:03,649
especially when software engineers are

547
00:21:03,649 --> 00:21:06,679
delivering code so fast right and things

548
00:21:06,679 --> 00:21:08,809
are auto-scaling and changing a constant

549
00:21:08,809 --> 00:21:11,029
basis is very difficult to ensure that

550
00:21:11,029 --> 00:21:13,519
our security works the way we needed to

551
00:21:13,519 --> 00:21:16,129
when we needed to without some kind of

552
00:21:16,129 --> 00:21:18,759
constant instrumentation post deployment

553
00:21:18,759 --> 00:21:21,409
so it's about reducing uncertainty by

554
00:21:21,409 --> 00:21:23,899
building confidence have actually

555
00:21:23,899 --> 00:21:26,619
functions versus how we expect it to

556
00:21:26,619 --> 00:21:30,289
expecting it is is is basing your your

557
00:21:30,289 --> 00:21:34,429
engineering on hope versus versus solid

558
00:21:34,429 --> 00:21:36,590
instrumentation and that's what this is

559
00:21:36,590 --> 00:21:42,559
really about mmm use cases for chaos

560
00:21:42,559 --> 00:21:45,109
engineering there are more here i I was

561
00:21:45,109 --> 00:21:46,460
only the beginning of this that doesn't

562
00:21:46,460 --> 00:21:48,230
mean I I know all the ways can be

563
00:21:48,230 --> 00:21:50,059
applied and if anyone ever applies it in

564
00:21:50,059 --> 00:21:51,590
other ways I'd love to hear about the

565
00:21:51,590 --> 00:21:53,749
stories and how you're applying it here

566
00:21:53,749 --> 00:21:55,940
are the ways that I've used it in the

567
00:21:55,940 --> 00:21:58,879
past and the ways I believe it can be

568
00:21:58,879 --> 00:22:01,249
used is it's very valuable in this

569
00:22:01,249 --> 00:22:03,619
response is that see I'm gonna talk

570
00:22:03,619 --> 00:22:05,210
about that here in a second it's great

571
00:22:05,210 --> 00:22:06,679
to validate run books ensure that you

572
00:22:06,679 --> 00:22:09,649
have the right log data ensure that you

573
00:22:09,649 --> 00:22:12,530
know to validate if so to about

574
00:22:12,530 --> 00:22:14,060
so you could he controls fire when in

575
00:22:14,060 --> 00:22:18,350
certain conditions it's it's good to to

576
00:22:18,350 --> 00:22:19,670
validate solutions architecture whether

577
00:22:19,670 --> 00:22:21,650
that be in sort of your staging

578
00:22:21,650 --> 00:22:23,240
environments it's okay to do chaos

579
00:22:23,240 --> 00:22:24,710
engineering and staging and not in

580
00:22:24,710 --> 00:22:27,350
production some some people some a lot

581
00:22:27,350 --> 00:22:29,270
of folks always talk about online if you

582
00:22:29,270 --> 00:22:31,850
google do the Google's people talk about

583
00:22:31,850 --> 00:22:34,130
do chaos engineering production well

584
00:22:34,130 --> 00:22:35,600
there's a lot about you still in staging

585
00:22:35,600 --> 00:22:38,120
okay still learn a lot but the goal is

586
00:22:38,120 --> 00:22:40,460
to take the leap of faith is what I like

587
00:22:40,460 --> 00:22:42,500
to call it to to production it's also

588
00:22:42,500 --> 00:22:44,540
read for compliance chaos engineering it

589
00:22:44,540 --> 00:22:45,980
basically proves whether or not at a

590
00:22:45,980 --> 00:22:47,960
kiss engineering experiment proves

591
00:22:47,960 --> 00:22:51,290
whether the technology that you that you

592
00:22:51,290 --> 00:22:53,180
built either works the way you figured

593
00:22:53,180 --> 00:22:56,300
it or not if I met up with a compliance

594
00:22:56,300 --> 00:22:58,280
framework and you have every cast

595
00:22:58,280 --> 00:22:59,720
basically every cast experiment has

596
00:22:59,720 --> 00:23:02,450
compliance value it's also a prima

597
00:23:02,450 --> 00:23:03,890
virani app in which user pinterest

598
00:23:03,890 --> 00:23:05,690
started doing some experiments around

599
00:23:05,690 --> 00:23:08,030
improving log data by proactively

600
00:23:08,030 --> 00:23:10,190
introducing failure conditions security

601
00:23:10,190 --> 00:23:11,750
failure conditions we try to determine

602
00:23:11,750 --> 00:23:13,970
whether or not the log data that during

603
00:23:13,970 --> 00:23:16,250
those events generated of the controls

604
00:23:16,250 --> 00:23:18,380
iterated I was actually valuable his

605
00:23:18,380 --> 00:23:20,240
during a net active incidents you're not

606
00:23:20,240 --> 00:23:21,530
looking at the value of log data you're

607
00:23:21,530 --> 00:23:22,280
trying to figure out what the heck

608
00:23:22,280 --> 00:23:25,130
happened stopping it and getting the

609
00:23:25,130 --> 00:23:27,430
system back to a point of continuity

610
00:23:27,430 --> 00:23:29,930
it's a response so i'm cover is

611
00:23:29,930 --> 00:23:32,150
responsible bit so it's gonna be pretty

612
00:23:32,150 --> 00:23:33,500
and since are somewhat subjective in

613
00:23:33,500 --> 00:23:35,000
nature no matter how much money you

614
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:36,470
spend no matter how many people you have

615
00:23:36,470 --> 00:23:38,030
you still don't know when it's gonna

616
00:23:38,030 --> 00:23:38,450
happen

617
00:23:38,450 --> 00:23:40,070
where it's gonna happen why they're

618
00:23:40,070 --> 00:23:42,620
doing it who's doing it and how they're

619
00:23:42,620 --> 00:23:44,120
how they got in or how they're trying to

620
00:23:44,120 --> 00:23:44,900
get it right

621
00:23:44,900 --> 00:23:47,990
you hope that what you put in place can

622
00:23:47,990 --> 00:23:49,880
tell you those things but still you

623
00:23:49,880 --> 00:23:51,410
don't know until it actually happened

624
00:23:51,410 --> 00:23:54,830
right so what so you're and you're

625
00:23:54,830 --> 00:23:56,390
hoping that what you put in place can

626
00:23:56,390 --> 00:23:58,400
tell you whether these questions are

627
00:23:58,400 --> 00:24:00,740
true or false but chaos engineering does

628
00:24:00,740 --> 00:24:02,210
it allows you to proactively introduce

629
00:24:02,210 --> 00:24:03,560
the failure came to failure conditions

630
00:24:03,560 --> 00:24:05,900
into the system and you can you can now

631
00:24:05,900 --> 00:24:07,670
know the point of which an incident

632
00:24:07,670 --> 00:24:09,110
started and to measure how effective was

633
00:24:09,110 --> 00:24:10,550
the team do we have the right skills

634
00:24:10,550 --> 00:24:12,530
does the technology work did the

635
00:24:12,530 --> 00:24:14,840
controls fire into that condition but

636
00:24:14,840 --> 00:24:17,060
there is no there is no active incident

637
00:24:17,060 --> 00:24:18,680
remember chaos engineering there's no

638
00:24:18,680 --> 00:24:20,120
active it's that nobody's freaking out

639
00:24:20,120 --> 00:24:22,190
right people are learning you can learn

640
00:24:22,190 --> 00:24:23,390
that if things aren't working the way

641
00:24:23,390 --> 00:24:25,429
they are and fix them so there is no

642
00:24:25,429 --> 00:24:26,890
pain

643
00:24:26,890 --> 00:24:29,640
and the nature of the issue is that this

644
00:24:29,640 --> 00:24:31,780
response to the problem since response

645
00:24:31,780 --> 00:24:34,120
we can be proactive through these new

646
00:24:34,120 --> 00:24:37,390
techniques like I said when this

647
00:24:37,390 --> 00:24:38,560
happened people freaked out

648
00:24:38,560 --> 00:24:41,770
it's not a good learning environment in

649
00:24:41,770 --> 00:24:43,840
chaos in Syria like I said we're going

650
00:24:43,840 --> 00:24:45,430
to articulating here it's about making

651
00:24:45,430 --> 00:24:46,900
the post mortem your preparation

652
00:24:46,900 --> 00:24:49,710
exercise instead of the after the fact

653
00:24:49,710 --> 00:24:53,530
exercise I talked a little bit about

654
00:24:53,530 --> 00:24:54,370
chaos singer

655
00:24:54,370 --> 00:24:55,900
Kessinger was a project that we built

656
00:24:55,900 --> 00:24:57,820
United Health Group when I was there I

657
00:24:57,820 --> 00:25:00,370
was a little over a half ago but it was

658
00:25:00,370 --> 00:25:01,990
the first ever application of Netflix's

659
00:25:01,990 --> 00:25:04,660
chaos engineering to cyber security it's

660
00:25:04,660 --> 00:25:06,790
it's still valuable tool and open source

661
00:25:06,790 --> 00:25:09,160
project on github it there's a you can

662
00:25:09,160 --> 00:25:10,990
basically it gives you the framework on

663
00:25:10,990 --> 00:25:13,150
how to write experiments in terms of

664
00:25:13,150 --> 00:25:16,300
Python and lambda it's so if you go out

665
00:25:16,300 --> 00:25:18,160
there to github you look for chaos

666
00:25:18,160 --> 00:25:21,580
Slayer I there's an opt-in app that

667
00:25:21,580 --> 00:25:23,170
motto you'd get more of the example code

668
00:25:23,170 --> 00:25:25,450
and framework and and there were quite a

669
00:25:25,450 --> 00:25:26,830
few people using this how people what

670
00:25:26,830 --> 00:25:28,330
they do is they fork it so write their

671
00:25:28,330 --> 00:25:30,280
own piggy ok they get the idea this is

672
00:25:30,280 --> 00:25:31,720
how you write it and start writing their

673
00:25:31,720 --> 00:25:34,420
own I'm gonna give a brief example of

674
00:25:34,420 --> 00:25:35,380
how chaos singer works

675
00:25:35,380 --> 00:25:36,940
just sort of understand so you can give

676
00:25:36,940 --> 00:25:38,620
it frame it up in your head on how a

677
00:25:38,620 --> 00:25:41,860
security caste experiment works ok so

678
00:25:41,860 --> 00:25:43,810
the primary example we chose with chaos

679
00:25:43,810 --> 00:25:46,290
singer well as we want an example that

680
00:25:46,290 --> 00:25:48,400
when we open sourced it because the

681
00:25:48,400 --> 00:25:49,570
first open source tree UnitedHealth

682
00:25:49,570 --> 00:25:52,390
first open source tool for United Health

683
00:25:52,390 --> 00:25:56,140
Group we wanted a a an experiment that a

684
00:25:56,140 --> 00:25:58,180
wide body of engineers could understand

685
00:25:58,180 --> 00:26:00,550
and for some other reason you know

686
00:26:00,550 --> 00:26:04,810
firewall misconfigured ports Muscovy

687
00:26:04,810 --> 00:26:07,330
reports kind of seem to be happening all

688
00:26:07,330 --> 00:26:07,930
the time

689
00:26:07,930 --> 00:26:09,910
still you think that'd be a soul problem

690
00:26:09,910 --> 00:26:13,060
but it's not and so we figured kind of

691
00:26:13,060 --> 00:26:14,470
everybody knows what a firewall is

692
00:26:14,470 --> 00:26:15,790
everybody kind of understands what it

693
00:26:15,790 --> 00:26:16,240
does

694
00:26:16,240 --> 00:26:17,740
whether you're a software engineer or

695
00:26:17,740 --> 00:26:20,200
your security engineer network or QA or

696
00:26:20,200 --> 00:26:22,720
so our example was ports later so well

697
00:26:22,720 --> 00:26:24,070
port CEO dies it was proactively

698
00:26:24,070 --> 00:26:26,380
introduced a misconfigured offer I

699
00:26:26,380 --> 00:26:28,570
support change in Amazon and what we did

700
00:26:28,570 --> 00:26:31,210
was we started doing this or an Amazon

701
00:26:31,210 --> 00:26:33,820
instances we found our expectation was

702
00:26:33,820 --> 00:26:35,320
is that the firewall would immediately

703
00:26:35,320 --> 00:26:37,930
detect the block it to be a non-issue we

704
00:26:37,930 --> 00:26:39,140
found out was about six

705
00:26:39,140 --> 00:26:41,690
she said the time that was true 60% of

706
00:26:41,690 --> 00:26:46,100
the time but about 100% of the time the

707
00:26:46,100 --> 00:26:48,830
the commodity cow config club

708
00:26:48,830 --> 00:26:50,240
configuration minutes will caught it

709
00:26:50,240 --> 00:26:51,320
every time and blocked it

710
00:26:51,320 --> 00:26:53,930
so proactively when there was no instant

711
00:26:53,930 --> 00:26:55,430
no outage we learned some of these

712
00:26:55,430 --> 00:26:57,020
things weren't working the way we needed

713
00:26:57,020 --> 00:26:59,330
them to it was actually the issue was a

714
00:26:59,330 --> 00:27:02,480
configuration drift issue that we fixed

715
00:27:02,480 --> 00:27:04,730
because there was no a digital pain no

716
00:27:04,730 --> 00:27:06,560
downtime they fixed it okay

717
00:27:06,560 --> 00:27:09,320
whoops move on right so after both

718
00:27:09,320 --> 00:27:11,870
controls fired we expected enough data

719
00:27:11,870 --> 00:27:13,670
to generate an alert to the security

720
00:27:13,670 --> 00:27:16,990
operation center the sock that happened

721
00:27:16,990 --> 00:27:19,370
successfully but the data what's in the

722
00:27:19,370 --> 00:27:21,080
sock the sake analyst didn't know what

723
00:27:21,080 --> 00:27:23,600
Amazon is since it came from now as an

724
00:27:23,600 --> 00:27:25,250
engineer you can say we can Mack back

725
00:27:25,250 --> 00:27:27,140
the IP address well I'm betting back

726
00:27:27,140 --> 00:27:28,640
there you go Peters could take a few

727
00:27:28,640 --> 00:27:30,200
minutes not to mention if there's

728
00:27:30,200 --> 00:27:31,640
something called s naught s naught is a

729
00:27:31,640 --> 00:27:33,380
thing that's that intentionally hides

730
00:27:33,380 --> 00:27:36,260
the real IP address so it could be 30 it

731
00:27:36,260 --> 00:27:38,000
could be any work for 30 minutes three

732
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:41,000
hours if if it's a million dollars a

733
00:27:41,000 --> 00:27:43,190
minute that's a lot of money but we

734
00:27:43,190 --> 00:27:44,540
proactively learned all we had to do is

735
00:27:44,540 --> 00:27:48,650
that a pointer and a pointer and it was

736
00:27:48,650 --> 00:27:53,630
fixed so anyway so we were proactive we

737
00:27:53,630 --> 00:27:54,830
were able to proactively learn about all

738
00:27:54,830 --> 00:27:56,780
these things that could have caused not

739
00:27:56,780 --> 00:27:58,850
to mention not not not to mention cost

740
00:27:58,850 --> 00:28:00,680
the company money the customers pain

741
00:28:00,680 --> 00:28:02,360
especially talking about some people's

742
00:28:02,360 --> 00:28:05,450
healthcare they they it's very important

743
00:28:05,450 --> 00:28:07,310
for them that that we healthcare people

744
00:28:07,310 --> 00:28:09,980
get that right so I'm gonna leave you

745
00:28:09,980 --> 00:28:13,490
with two things I feel like I've put a

746
00:28:13,490 --> 00:28:15,740
lot of jump on this presentation but you

747
00:28:15,740 --> 00:28:17,750
got a lot from him but it's about it's

748
00:28:17,750 --> 00:28:19,580
it's about we did stop looking for

749
00:28:19,580 --> 00:28:21,350
better answers and start asking better

750
00:28:21,350 --> 00:28:24,200
questions so here right here is a link

751
00:28:24,200 --> 00:28:25,970
to the new book that just came out

752
00:28:25,970 --> 00:28:28,460
literally we just got our copies of the

753
00:28:28,460 --> 00:28:29,600
book today in the mail

754
00:28:29,600 --> 00:28:32,660
the the authors did actually the core

755
00:28:32,660 --> 00:28:33,470
authors didn't get up with the

756
00:28:33,470 --> 00:28:36,020
contributing authors did some reason but

757
00:28:36,020 --> 00:28:39,220
anyway um yeah here's a link to the book

758
00:28:39,220 --> 00:28:41,900
and I'll open up for questions Thank You

759
00:28:41,900 --> 00:28:45,680
Erin okay so let's see we got a couple

760
00:28:45,680 --> 00:28:47,330
of questions here we're kind of running

761
00:28:47,330 --> 00:28:49,250
out of time too so I'll try to be quick

762
00:28:49,250 --> 00:28:51,240
on them okay

763
00:28:51,240 --> 00:28:56,340
okay let's see here so the first

764
00:28:56,340 --> 00:28:59,760
question is talked about confidence it's

765
00:28:59,760 --> 00:29:02,400
only as good as the previous practice

766
00:29:02,400 --> 00:29:06,510
isn't it like mental crap oh you say

767
00:29:06,510 --> 00:29:08,010
that again

768
00:29:08,010 --> 00:29:12,960
confidence is only as good as a check

769
00:29:12,960 --> 00:29:16,790
here they seem to be scrolling up

770
00:29:16,790 --> 00:29:19,530
confidence is only as good as a previous

771
00:29:19,530 --> 00:29:23,960
practice isn't it like a mental trap

772
00:29:23,960 --> 00:29:27,780
well um so yes I think I know that

773
00:29:27,780 --> 00:29:29,160
coming from we can expand on this in the

774
00:29:29,160 --> 00:29:32,100
slack bug but the confidence like see

775
00:29:32,100 --> 00:29:33,360
the conferences you're getting yourself

776
00:29:33,360 --> 00:29:35,670
trying to say I believe when X occurs of

777
00:29:35,670 --> 00:29:38,340
my system my assumption is when X occurs

778
00:29:38,340 --> 00:29:41,070
y is a response right how often you

779
00:29:41,070 --> 00:29:42,990
actually ever instrument that so what we

780
00:29:42,990 --> 00:29:44,640
do is we actually it will actually

781
00:29:44,640 --> 00:29:46,679
instrument that it's a post employment

782
00:29:46,679 --> 00:29:49,530
thing not a CI not a CD thing it's post

783
00:29:49,530 --> 00:29:51,809
deployment where these these sort of our

784
00:29:51,809 --> 00:29:55,440
resource art to occur and we're building

785
00:29:55,440 --> 00:29:56,820
confidence that the system is still

786
00:29:56,820 --> 00:29:58,650
functioning as it was designed and or

787
00:29:58,650 --> 00:30:00,750
coded or intended to and that's where

788
00:30:00,750 --> 00:30:02,700
the confidence comes from and but you

789
00:30:02,700 --> 00:30:04,170
are I think if I the ship we're coming

790
00:30:04,170 --> 00:30:05,700
from it's really kind of lonely as good

791
00:30:05,700 --> 00:30:07,679
as the experiments right and the number

792
00:30:07,679 --> 00:30:09,750
of experiments you run how often you run

793
00:30:09,750 --> 00:30:12,540
them and I that that's very true but

794
00:30:12,540 --> 00:30:14,460
that but what it also I think this might

795
00:30:14,460 --> 00:30:16,620
be another issue another piece you

796
00:30:16,620 --> 00:30:18,059
brought up is that it helps us

797
00:30:18,059 --> 00:30:19,500
understand how effective some of our

798
00:30:19,500 --> 00:30:21,540
other measures might have been or not on

799
00:30:21,540 --> 00:30:23,640
the controls or testing methodologies

800
00:30:23,640 --> 00:30:26,040
it's another way of providing a feedback

801
00:30:26,040 --> 00:30:28,020
loop to those mechanisms and improving

802
00:30:28,020 --> 00:30:30,000
them that's what I hope is that question

803
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:31,650
we can expand on that in the motor and

804
00:30:31,650 --> 00:30:34,950
fire okay then the other one says here

805
00:30:34,950 --> 00:30:38,670
what could cover 19 handling and learn

806
00:30:38,670 --> 00:30:44,460
from chaos engineering that is a good

807
00:30:44,460 --> 00:30:46,110
one I will tell you the CAF's

808
00:30:46,110 --> 00:30:47,610
engineering and the practice of

809
00:30:47,610 --> 00:30:48,990
resilience engineering is a larger

810
00:30:48,990 --> 00:30:52,050
domain has never been more at a higher

811
00:30:52,050 --> 00:30:55,530
point of concern then right now just

812
00:30:55,530 --> 00:30:57,059
because technologies are being stretched

813
00:30:57,059 --> 00:30:58,550
like they've never been stressed before

814
00:30:58,550 --> 00:31:03,320
and chaos engineering really is a

815
00:31:03,320 --> 00:31:05,010
security or it's available

816
00:31:05,010 --> 00:31:06,960
Lily but availability I mean like this

817
00:31:06,960 --> 00:31:08,570
is really a stability of our systems

818
00:31:08,570 --> 00:31:11,580
it's one way to proactively identify if

819
00:31:11,580 --> 00:31:13,140
a failure is gonna happen before it does

820
00:31:13,140 --> 00:31:14,910
because the issue is is that you don't

821
00:31:14,910 --> 00:31:16,260
know where the edge is in your system

822
00:31:16,260 --> 00:31:17,880
until you fall off of it

823
00:31:17,880 --> 00:31:19,740
okay engineering you can identify where

824
00:31:19,740 --> 00:31:21,390
the edges and the points that lead up to

825
00:31:21,390 --> 00:31:23,250
it and know hey if that only gives you

826
00:31:23,250 --> 00:31:25,890
15 minutes like to know that at least

827
00:31:25,890 --> 00:31:27,540
you have 15 minutes to notify the call

828
00:31:27,540 --> 00:31:28,950
center put up put a stable on the

829
00:31:28,950 --> 00:31:30,840
website that hey are notified key

830
00:31:30,840 --> 00:31:32,820
customers that hey we're about to

831
00:31:32,820 --> 00:31:34,830
experience a major outage it shows you

832
00:31:34,830 --> 00:31:36,510
your control the situation not you're

833
00:31:36,510 --> 00:31:38,550
just responding to a fire drill this

834
00:31:38,550 --> 00:31:40,920
other question is probably similar to -

835
00:31:40,920 --> 00:31:42,480
would you just responded

836
00:31:42,480 --> 00:31:44,940
is there any relations between chaos

837
00:31:44,940 --> 00:31:47,640
engine earing between chaos theory and

838
00:31:47,640 --> 00:31:51,960
immunes immune systems so complex

839
00:31:51,960 --> 00:31:53,840
systems is where chaos theory comes from

840
00:31:53,840 --> 00:31:56,670
and Patricia tably they've been mostly

841
00:31:56,670 --> 00:31:58,380
studied in the fields in the fields of

842
00:31:58,380 --> 00:32:02,040
medicine and nuclear nuclear nuclear

843
00:32:02,040 --> 00:32:05,640
power the military and really it was

844
00:32:05,640 --> 00:32:08,490
John all spa and David woods and Klein

845
00:32:08,490 --> 00:32:10,860
and and Richard cook that brought the

846
00:32:10,860 --> 00:32:12,810
brought the craft in to what we do in

847
00:32:12,810 --> 00:32:14,370
technology because of the rule

848
00:32:14,370 --> 00:32:16,380
technology is now playing in society but

849
00:32:16,380 --> 00:32:17,460
it's actually if you doin either

850
00:32:17,460 --> 00:32:19,530
research do the reading and you think

851
00:32:19,530 --> 00:32:21,420
about what you do when you're reading it

852
00:32:21,420 --> 00:32:24,120
it's it's remarkable how similar and how

853
00:32:24,120 --> 00:32:27,330
much it relates it's what we do and then

854
00:32:27,330 --> 00:32:29,610
the last question is have you seen any

855
00:32:29,610 --> 00:32:31,260
companies actually doing chaos

856
00:32:31,260 --> 00:32:32,640
engineering for security

857
00:32:32,640 --> 00:32:35,640
I have there'll be several those are

858
00:32:35,640 --> 00:32:38,280
companies are sort of documenting their

859
00:32:38,280 --> 00:32:39,660
case studies and use cases in the

860
00:32:39,660 --> 00:32:41,600
O'Reilly book that's coming out in June

861
00:32:41,600 --> 00:32:43,830
yeah but I ought to feel a lot of people

862
00:32:43,830 --> 00:32:46,830
focusing around cloud and sort of be in

863
00:32:46,830 --> 00:32:48,930
miss a lot of its it's not like about

864
00:32:48,930 --> 00:32:50,700
it's not pen testing it's not read to me

865
00:32:50,700 --> 00:32:52,260
it's not purple to me it's failure

866
00:32:52,260 --> 00:32:54,150
injection okay so it's a little

867
00:32:54,150 --> 00:32:56,970
different but it's it's but it's still

868
00:32:56,970 --> 00:32:58,170
the same concept you're trying to

869
00:32:58,170 --> 00:33:00,180
validate that that that all that money

870
00:33:00,180 --> 00:33:02,160
you spent on security is still working

871
00:33:02,160 --> 00:33:05,550
day one day ten 208,000 the way it was

872
00:33:05,550 --> 00:33:07,680
supposed to be working and that's a lot

873
00:33:07,680 --> 00:33:09,030
of people focused on either container

874
00:33:09,030 --> 00:33:11,340
solutions or the focus on sort of cloud

875
00:33:11,340 --> 00:33:13,290
miss configuration but it's about

876
00:33:13,290 --> 00:33:15,030
accidents and mistakes that happen as a

877
00:33:15,030 --> 00:33:18,600
result of the complexity good

878
00:33:18,600 --> 00:33:20,730
well thank you very much Aaron for

879
00:33:20,730 --> 00:33:23,070
joining us today and we'll see you over

880
00:33:23,070 --> 00:33:24,240
there on the slack Channel

881
00:33:24,240 --> 00:33:28,010
thanks for having me hey thank you
