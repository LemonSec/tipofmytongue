1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,340
into the stream as well look at this

2
00:00:02,340 --> 00:00:03,270
this is amazing

3
00:00:03,270 --> 00:00:05,460
amazing technology we're done how are

4
00:00:05,460 --> 00:00:08,189
you hi I'm great thanks for having me

00:00:20,010 --> 00:00:24,990
a yeah but we're on the same boat here

12
00:00:24,990 --> 00:00:27,650
so I'm guessing you can relate yeah

13
00:00:27,650 --> 00:00:30,960
usually I work in a a really cool

14
00:00:30,960 --> 00:00:33,360
startup called UVI we do vehicle

15
00:00:33,360 --> 00:00:35,309
inspection contactless vehicle

16
00:00:35,309 --> 00:00:37,590
inspection which is in the style right

17
00:00:37,590 --> 00:00:41,280
now and they I really really love

18
00:00:41,280 --> 00:00:43,739
angular I really love the firebase and I

19
00:00:43,739 --> 00:00:45,719
want to share this love with you well

20
00:00:45,719 --> 00:00:47,460

ask for people to add questions and

25
00:00:58,379 --> 00:01:01,230
things like that into either slack or

26
00:01:01,230 --> 00:01:04,199
into slide oh and we'll we'll pass them

27

excellent okay let's see what we've got

32
00:01:31,480 --> 00:01:32,140

Dan and thank you for having me eh

35
00:01:42,280 --> 00:01:45,220
one of my biggest passions in life is

36
00:01:45,220 --> 00:01:48,070
creating things and I'll tell you the

37
00:01:48,070 --> 00:01:50,620
truth I'm not that good at it I mean I'm

38
00:01:50,620 --> 00:01:52,720
good at the UI part but I'm really bad

39
00:01:52,720 --> 00:01:55,960
at the backend part that's why I was so

40
00:01:55,960 --> 00:01:58,510
happy when I found out about firebase it

41
00:01:58,510 --> 00:02:04,110
allows me to hand over all the tedious a

42
00:02:04,770 --> 00:02:07,869
parts of the development of the back-end

43
00:02:07,869 --> 00:02:10,750
development to a wonderful a solution

44
00:02:10,750 --> 00:02:12,790
called firebase and I want to show it to

45
00:02:12,790 --> 00:02:16,090
you in second a down here you can see my

46
00:02:16,090 --> 00:02:16,900
Twitter handle

47
00:02:16,900 --> 00:02:21,280
I recommend a follow me I'm about to

48
00:02:21,280 --> 00:02:24,459
share a very important link for the for

49
00:02:24,459 --> 00:02:26,650
this presentation I think it's gonna be

50
00:02:26,650 --> 00:02:30,400
a nice surprise but first thing first

51
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:33,940
let's start so a what I want to show you

52
00:02:33,940 --> 00:02:36,340
is first a couple of projects I did with

53
00:02:36,340 --> 00:02:38,110
firebase because many people think that

54
00:02:38,110 --> 00:02:40,000
firebase isn't mature enough for real

55
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:42,010
world application and I want to show you

56
00:02:42,010 --> 00:02:47,709
it is a really a mature so as I said I'm

57
00:02:47,709 --> 00:02:49,900
working at UVI UVI is a vehicle

58
00:02:49,900 --> 00:02:53,049
inspection company and what we do is

59
00:02:53,049 --> 00:02:57,190
scan vehicles take the images a pass

60
00:02:57,190 --> 00:03:02,370
them through a algorithm that traces

61
00:03:02,370 --> 00:03:04,870
abnormalities threads things like that

62
00:03:04,870 --> 00:03:09,459
as you can see we scan a the exterior

63
00:03:09,459 --> 00:03:15,760
scan the wilt and a firebase is a really

64
00:03:15,760 --> 00:03:18,970
big part of our project a basically one

65
00:03:18,970 --> 00:03:21,670
of the most amazing features we use here

66
00:03:21,670 --> 00:03:25,170
is a fabric storage they allow you to

67
00:03:25,170 --> 00:03:28,360
store files huge files huge amounts of

68
00:03:28,360 --> 00:03:31,510
data really easily and to retrieve them

69
00:03:31,510 --> 00:03:34,510
whenever you want them very efficient

70
00:03:34,510 --> 00:03:37,260
and easy to use permission and

71
00:03:37,260 --> 00:03:42,540
system and a another thing that I think

72
00:03:42,540 --> 00:03:44,849
it's important to mention is that if

73
00:03:44,849 --> 00:03:47,159
firebase is only a part of our product

74
00:03:47,159 --> 00:03:49,920
of our solution because firebase do have

75
00:03:49,920 --> 00:03:52,620
disadvantages in our cakes for example

76
00:03:52,620 --> 00:03:57,090
for example excuse me FedEx don't have

77
00:03:57,090 --> 00:04:01,440
an on-premise solution and we do so not

78
00:04:01,440 --> 00:04:03,480
everything isn't in their firebase a

79
00:04:03,480 --> 00:04:06,569
here's a CRM system I've built a what's

80
00:04:06,569 --> 00:04:09,900
special about this system that serves

81
00:04:09,900 --> 00:04:13,769
tens of thousands of end-users and not

82
00:04:13,769 --> 00:04:16,978
just the administration and an important

83
00:04:16,978 --> 00:04:19,139
thing to mention about a system is that

84
00:04:19,139 --> 00:04:24,300
it a prefer performs transactions of

85
00:04:24,300 --> 00:04:27,260
over three million dollars a year is

86
00:04:27,260 --> 00:04:30,840
made by tens of thousands of the users

87
00:04:30,840 --> 00:04:33,030
and everything as you can see works

88
00:04:33,030 --> 00:04:36,600
seamlessly and one last thing I really

89
00:04:36,600 --> 00:04:39,960
enjoy I'm not sure you all know likely

90
00:04:39,960 --> 00:04:42,180
we have the a Pesach Seder the

91
00:04:42,180 --> 00:04:44,849
traditional Seder dinner and during the

92
00:04:44,849 --> 00:04:48,000
Seder dinner we usually it's a custom

93
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:49,979
it's a tradition we hide them at SAP we

94
00:04:49,979 --> 00:04:53,460
call it an African man and as you know

95
00:04:53,460 --> 00:04:57,479
we did our Seder is here alone and we

96
00:04:57,479 --> 00:05:00,300
could hide the afikoman to let people

97
00:05:00,300 --> 00:05:03,120
know that it actually exists if so I

98
00:05:03,120 --> 00:05:06,210
created this a cool little game that can

99
00:05:06,210 --> 00:05:08,400
search for the African Mango itself I

100
00:05:08,400 --> 00:05:10,919
urge you to go in there I think it's a

101
00:05:10,919 --> 00:05:13,650
lot of fun a few command.com

102
00:05:13,650 --> 00:05:18,510
but a linking here to see what wonderful

103
00:05:18,510 --> 00:05:21,300
things i'm doing you wanna see how you

104
00:05:21,300 --> 00:05:24,389
can use it to create wonderful things so

105
00:05:24,389 --> 00:05:28,130
let's start okay one second

106
00:05:28,130 --> 00:05:32,970
Seder dinner a so as I said angular and

107
00:05:32,970 --> 00:05:33,810
firebase

108
00:05:33,810 --> 00:05:37,409
first of all it's very important to make

109
00:05:37,409 --> 00:05:39,150
it clear that angular and firebase are

110
00:05:39,150 --> 00:05:41,490
two completely separate products you can

111
00:05:41,490 --> 00:05:43,380
use one without the other you can use

112
00:05:43,380 --> 00:05:46,800
the angular with a Java back-end or a

113
00:05:46,800 --> 00:05:49,320
PHP back and if you're unlucky and you

114
00:05:49,320 --> 00:05:50,969
can use firebase with react

115
00:05:50,969 --> 00:05:55,589
you what have you but I think they work

116
00:05:55,589 --> 00:05:58,229
amazing together I really do it first of

117
00:05:58,229 --> 00:05:59,819
all because they both come from Google

118
00:05:59,819 --> 00:06:03,299
and no one said it officially but I do

119
00:06:03,299 --> 00:06:05,819
believe that their combination angular

120
00:06:05,819 --> 00:06:08,879
with firebase represent a Google's

121
00:06:08,879 --> 00:06:11,939
vision of CPC back-end fronting the

122
00:06:11,939 --> 00:06:14,189
architecture they work amazing together

123
00:06:14,189 --> 00:06:16,969
I'll show you I'll soon show you how a

124
00:06:16,969 --> 00:06:19,079
second reason they work amazing together

125
00:06:19,079 --> 00:06:21,539
is their that they're both a JavaScript

126
00:06:21,539 --> 00:06:23,999
type script to be exact which is even

127
00:06:23,999 --> 00:06:27,649
better and that allows you to share a

128
00:06:27,649 --> 00:06:31,739
code to share a types it expedites the

129
00:06:31,739 --> 00:06:35,669
development by great deal and it's an

130
00:06:35,669 --> 00:06:37,649
amazing experience and last but not

131
00:06:37,649 --> 00:06:42,360
least they both use a rxjs observables

132
00:06:42,360 --> 00:06:45,029
this is wonderful if you don't know it

133
00:06:45,029 --> 00:06:47,009
it's a wonderful and amazing way to pass

134
00:06:47,009 --> 00:06:49,819
data and to handle changing data

135
00:06:49,819 --> 00:06:54,029
mutating data a umbrella is very

136
00:06:54,029 --> 00:06:57,599
strongly entangled with observables and

137
00:06:57,599 --> 00:07:00,629
firebase is very strongly a entangled

138
00:07:00,629 --> 00:07:03,360
with a WebSockets and they're both great

139
00:07:03,360 --> 00:07:05,999
ways to pass changing information a long

140
00:07:05,999 --> 00:07:08,399
time and soon I'll show you how they

141
00:07:08,399 --> 00:07:10,259
work amazing together it makes your life

142
00:07:10,259 --> 00:07:14,639
so much more easier okay so step into

143
00:07:14,639 --> 00:07:16,849
the fire what does firebase actually

144
00:07:16,849 --> 00:07:19,439
offers us so first of all it's a

145
00:07:19,439 --> 00:07:22,019
database it's a known SQL database that

146
00:07:22,019 --> 00:07:23,999
is really easy and fun to use

147
00:07:23,999 --> 00:07:26,429
it's hosting and hosting is not that a

148
00:07:26,429 --> 00:07:28,889
big deal you know that but oh my god

149
00:07:28,889 --> 00:07:31,739
it's so easy you love it also in a

150
00:07:31,739 --> 00:07:34,619
second a authentication user management

151
00:07:34,619 --> 00:07:38,579
it's it's always the same but it's

152
00:07:38,579 --> 00:07:41,369
always such a big deal to develop and to

153
00:07:41,369 --> 00:07:44,669
handle and firebase just makes it it's

154
00:07:44,669 --> 00:07:47,189
so easy like a breeze file storage which

155
00:07:47,189 --> 00:07:49,709
is like database it's unlike hosting

156
00:07:49,709 --> 00:07:54,059
because it's not static the assets it's

157
00:07:54,059 --> 00:07:57,539
changing that as its uploads images what

158
00:07:57,539 --> 00:08:00,449
have you and again it works great you've

159
00:08:00,449 --> 00:08:03,269
seen it earlier in the VI presentation

160
00:08:03,269 --> 00:08:04,830
cloud functions

161
00:08:04,830 --> 00:08:06,720
amazing after all you do need some

162
00:08:06,720 --> 00:08:11,070
back-end a some back-end logic and cloud

163
00:08:11,070 --> 00:08:12,990
function is a really easy and fun way to

164
00:08:12,990 --> 00:08:16,200
apply this logic analytics which is

165
00:08:16,200 --> 00:08:19,320
again not that hard but when it comes

166
00:08:19,320 --> 00:08:22,080
out of the box like that it's so much

167
00:08:22,080 --> 00:08:24,570
more fun and messaging you wanna send

168
00:08:24,570 --> 00:08:26,910
push messages on send SMS images you

169
00:08:26,910 --> 00:08:29,910
only send making firebase handles

170
00:08:29,910 --> 00:08:33,360
everything for you so let's start with a

171
00:08:33,360 --> 00:08:36,870
small example think of a basic update

172
00:08:36,870 --> 00:08:38,909
flow okay you all know this I'm not

173
00:08:38,909 --> 00:08:40,710
inventing anything here this is like

174
00:08:40,710 --> 00:08:45,090
they a generic a update flow the UI

175
00:08:45,090 --> 00:08:47,610
makes a request to the back end and the

176
00:08:47,610 --> 00:08:52,230
back end a returns a response but you've

177
00:08:52,230 --> 00:08:54,780
been to enough meetups and conference

178
00:08:54,780 --> 00:08:56,370
like this to know that this is a

179
00:08:56,370 --> 00:08:59,670
complete lie this never really exists

180
00:08:59,670 --> 00:09:03,030
this is in a fantasy pink bunny land

181
00:09:03,030 --> 00:09:05,220
world where you have this basic flow a

182
00:09:05,220 --> 00:09:08,550
more realistic basic flow is the UI a

183
00:09:08,550 --> 00:09:10,980
making a request to an endpoint you need

184
00:09:10,980 --> 00:09:14,340
to create in advance like rest slash a

185
00:09:14,340 --> 00:09:17,250
adds left something which invokes a

186
00:09:17,250 --> 00:09:18,930
controller that queries the database

187
00:09:18,930 --> 00:09:21,270
which returns the result the controller

188
00:09:21,270 --> 00:09:24,210
packs them in a data object and sends

189
00:09:24,210 --> 00:09:28,170
them back today to I and know now the

190
00:09:28,170 --> 00:09:32,400
bunny isn't so happy and even now I'm

191
00:09:32,400 --> 00:09:35,580
still being a bit optimistic because our

192
00:09:35,580 --> 00:09:39,660
real life a flow looks more like this

193
00:09:39,660 --> 00:09:41,760
this you'll have the user management

194
00:09:41,760 --> 00:09:45,720
here in the middle and every time the UI

195
00:09:45,720 --> 00:09:47,190
makes a request to the end but the end

196
00:09:47,190 --> 00:09:49,770
would have to ask the user management is

197
00:09:49,770 --> 00:09:53,000
the allowed and not allowed to that and

198
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:56,400
I'm not even mentioning ever handling

199
00:09:56,400 --> 00:09:59,850
and tests and see ICD and scaling and

200
00:09:59,850 --> 00:10:02,760
security and you end up with a dead

201
00:10:02,760 --> 00:10:06,330
bundle because it took the life the joy

202
00:10:06,330 --> 00:10:08,700
out of you and instead of enjoying your

203
00:10:08,700 --> 00:10:11,040
development process you find yourself

204
00:10:11,040 --> 00:10:13,800
handling tons of issues that are pretty

205
00:10:13,800 --> 00:10:16,560
much generic it's the same issues every

206
00:10:16,560 --> 00:10:18,420
time with each project

207
00:10:18,420 --> 00:10:21,709
they're a generic solution but there is

208
00:10:21,709 --> 00:10:24,480
so I want to show you how to make the

209
00:10:24,480 --> 00:10:28,589
sad bunny happy bunny I want to show you

210
00:10:28,589 --> 00:10:33,230
how to take this nightmare of a flow and

211
00:10:33,230 --> 00:10:38,579
really enjoyed this utopian a simplified

212
00:10:38,579 --> 00:10:41,940
flow so let me show you how firebase

213
00:10:41,940 --> 00:10:43,680
does that okay I'm gonna show you a

214
00:10:43,680 --> 00:10:45,779
little piece of code bear with me for a

215
00:10:45,779 --> 00:10:46,790
second

216
00:10:46,790 --> 00:10:49,470
okay what do we have here

217
00:10:49,470 --> 00:10:51,959
this is an example of a file-based code

218
00:10:51,959 --> 00:10:54,000
a JavaScript file based code by the way

219
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:56,760
firebase gives you a lot of other

220
00:10:56,760 --> 00:11:00,269
libraries to use a Python in c-sharp a

221
00:11:00,269 --> 00:11:03,389
iOS what-have-you but this is the

222
00:11:03,389 --> 00:11:07,170
JavaScript version and firebase provides

223
00:11:07,170 --> 00:11:10,440
you with these objects the DB object now

224
00:11:10,440 --> 00:11:12,000
I'll show to in a second how you

225
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:14,220
configure it it's really really easy but

226
00:11:14,220 --> 00:11:16,740
once you configure it your Superman when

227
00:11:16,740 --> 00:11:20,670
you have this DB check this out so using

228
00:11:20,670 --> 00:11:24,480
this I make a request to the collection

229
00:11:24,480 --> 00:11:29,970
users and they add it's that object if

230
00:11:29,970 --> 00:11:33,140
it succeeds document written if it fails

231
00:11:33,140 --> 00:11:38,970
console.log arrow arrow now what is the

232
00:11:38,970 --> 00:11:41,880
end point does the user's collection

233
00:11:41,880 --> 00:11:45,959
exist do I have permission I don't care

234
00:11:45,959 --> 00:11:48,449
I want to do an ad action I don't care

235
00:11:48,449 --> 00:11:50,250
about all the rest I just want to do it

236
00:11:50,250 --> 00:11:52,949
and believe it or not this piece of code

237
00:11:52,949 --> 00:11:56,250
is actually a working I'll show you in a

238
00:11:56,250 --> 00:11:58,470
second how I want to do a live demo but

239
00:11:58,470 --> 00:12:00,870
I want to talk to you for a second about

240
00:12:00,870 --> 00:12:03,329
the things I didn't do here notice what

241
00:12:03,329 --> 00:12:05,339
I didn't do here I didn't create an

242
00:12:05,339 --> 00:12:06,450
endpoint I don't know

243
00:12:06,450 --> 00:12:09,579
[Music]

244
00:12:53,810 --> 00:12:57,840
it looks like Alana's frozen on just

245
00:12:57,840 --> 00:12:59,460
please bear with me and I'm just going

246
00:12:59,460 --> 00:13:01,860
to try and see if we can get I down to

247
00:13:01,860 --> 00:13:04,400
rejoin

248
00:14:53,579 --> 00:14:55,769
sorry guys

249
00:14:55,769 --> 00:14:58,499
you there eh I'll just repeat the last

250
00:14:58,499 --> 00:15:01,230
few sentences these are all the things I

251
00:15:01,230 --> 00:15:03,660
didn't do I didn't create an endpoint

252
00:15:03,660 --> 00:15:05,189
and in create a controller I didn't do

253
00:15:05,189 --> 00:15:07,559
anything this comes out of the box and

254
00:15:07,559 --> 00:15:10,709
it's just working it's amazing and I

255
00:15:10,709 --> 00:15:15,299
want to show you a live demo so you can

256
00:15:15,299 --> 00:15:17,459
all see how simple it is to know that

257
00:15:17,459 --> 00:15:22,259
I'm not fooling you okay so what I did I

258
00:15:22,259 --> 00:15:25,079
created an angular project for those of

259
00:15:25,079 --> 00:15:27,360
you who don't know it's really easy all

260
00:15:27,360 --> 00:15:29,910
you need to do is install the angular

261
00:15:29,910 --> 00:15:33,809
CLI and do ng new when you write and

262
00:15:33,809 --> 00:15:37,649
renew you get the entire a wonderful

263
00:15:37,649 --> 00:15:40,949
world of development environment as well

264
00:15:40,949 --> 00:15:43,350
as the deployment tools to create your

265
00:15:43,350 --> 00:15:45,509
project right away without worrying

266
00:15:45,509 --> 00:15:48,029
about all the boring stuff so I did an

267
00:15:48,029 --> 00:15:51,959
ingénue and I got this basic a folder

268
00:15:51,959 --> 00:15:55,079
structure I hope you can see it and a as

269
00:15:55,079 --> 00:15:57,959
all other programs this also have an

270
00:15:57,959 --> 00:16:01,499
entry point and it's app module now this

271
00:16:01,499 --> 00:16:04,170
app module looks exactly as it is when I

272
00:16:04,170 --> 00:16:08,689
did engineer this is a completely new

273
00:16:08,689 --> 00:16:11,220
project you can see my a github later

274
00:16:11,220 --> 00:16:14,369
send your link all I did here was add

275
00:16:14,369 --> 00:16:18,720
the imported the angular modules and I

276
00:16:18,720 --> 00:16:22,139
also initialized this a firebase module

277
00:16:22,139 --> 00:16:25,529
they I'm sorry I added the firebase

278
00:16:25,529 --> 00:16:27,869
module I also initialize this one with

279
00:16:27,869 --> 00:16:30,689
this environment configs you can see

280
00:16:30,689 --> 00:16:32,850
here now where did I got these things

281
00:16:32,850 --> 00:16:35,939
it's really easy I recommend you all

282
00:16:35,939 --> 00:16:38,669
take a visit today a file-based console

283
00:16:38,669 --> 00:16:42,059
I'm sure some of you at least have some

284
00:16:42,059 --> 00:16:45,029
experience with AWS and you know how the

285
00:16:45,029 --> 00:16:48,269
AWS console look like now take a look at

286
00:16:48,269 --> 00:16:50,850
this this is easy this is fun this is

287
00:16:50,850 --> 00:16:53,160
something that you want to go into and

288
00:16:53,160 --> 00:16:55,470
one of the things I have here is an app

289
00:16:55,470 --> 00:17:01,619
I created earlier and it has this config

290
00:17:01,619 --> 00:17:03,959
settings which you just copy and paste

291
00:17:03,959 --> 00:17:06,959
there right here so I copy and paste it

292
00:17:06,959 --> 00:17:09,480
by the way this has nothing confid

293
00:17:09,480 --> 00:17:11,638
in it you can copy it I don't mind

294
00:17:11,638 --> 00:17:14,369
because this is just basically the

295
00:17:14,369 --> 00:17:19,349
endpoint of a day firebase you your

296
00:17:19,349 --> 00:17:21,388
application is talking to it doesn't

297
00:17:21,388 --> 00:17:24,329
have anything to do with permissions so

298
00:17:24,329 --> 00:17:26,909
you might have zero permissions but you

299
00:17:26,909 --> 00:17:29,970
can still talk to the firebase a service

300
00:17:29,970 --> 00:17:31,919
it won't answer you but you can still

301
00:17:31,919 --> 00:17:33,960
talk to it so this is completely

302
00:17:33,960 --> 00:17:38,130
unconfident shil and if I go back to the

303
00:17:38,130 --> 00:17:40,019
app module you can see I initialized and

304
00:17:40,019 --> 00:17:42,870
added a few other modules that's all

305
00:17:42,870 --> 00:17:44,519
nice and well but let's see how I

306
00:17:44,519 --> 00:17:47,100
actually use it so we'll start with the

307
00:17:47,100 --> 00:17:51,840
HTML part a the HTML here I think it's I

308
00:17:51,840 --> 00:17:54,450
hope it's pretty self-explanatory this

309
00:17:54,450 --> 00:17:57,110
is a title the angular way of

310
00:17:57,110 --> 00:17:59,820
interpolating if I click here you can

311
00:17:59,820 --> 00:18:03,179
see that on the app component TS I'm

312
00:18:03,179 --> 00:18:05,519
populating the title I'm initializing it

313
00:18:05,519 --> 00:18:09,840
and then I have this input field hey I

314
00:18:09,840 --> 00:18:12,210
called it my input this is the angular

315
00:18:12,210 --> 00:18:14,940
way of referring to elements in your

316
00:18:14,940 --> 00:18:18,450
markup and I have this button that does

317
00:18:18,450 --> 00:18:23,399
something when you click it exactly a it

318
00:18:23,399 --> 00:18:25,139
does on send we'll go into this a

319
00:18:25,139 --> 00:18:27,149
function in a second but let's save it

320
00:18:27,149 --> 00:18:31,049
and see how it looks here is the demo

321
00:18:31,049 --> 00:18:34,139
let's refresh it there we go and by the

322
00:18:34,139 --> 00:18:37,289
way a one little thing about the angular

323
00:18:37,289 --> 00:18:39,539
development environment it's really easy

324
00:18:39,539 --> 00:18:41,730
it's Auto refreshing you can see it here

325
00:18:41,730 --> 00:18:45,690
it's really nice so you can see I have

326
00:18:45,690 --> 00:18:47,580
all the elements here but what does this

327
00:18:47,580 --> 00:18:52,110
button does do when I look at the on

328
00:18:52,110 --> 00:18:55,649
send a function you can see it has

329
00:18:55,649 --> 00:18:58,019
something that is amazingly similar to

330
00:18:58,019 --> 00:18:59,789
other if you've shown you just a second

331
00:18:59,789 --> 00:19:01,740
ago it's really similar to this one but

332
00:19:01,740 --> 00:19:04,340
this is the angular way of seeing of a

333
00:19:04,340 --> 00:19:08,340
using it so first of all I inject the DB

334
00:19:08,340 --> 00:19:11,429
service if you remember I a set it up

335
00:19:11,429 --> 00:19:15,269
earlier in the ng model in the app

336
00:19:15,269 --> 00:19:18,210
module and one thing I initialize it

337
00:19:18,210 --> 00:19:21,870
again I'm Superman now so with this DB I

338
00:19:21,870 --> 00:19:23,010
refer to date

339
00:19:23,010 --> 00:19:24,990
collection messages by the way this is

340
00:19:24,990 --> 00:19:28,130
the angular way of setting a type I

341
00:19:28,130 --> 00:19:31,800
defined a type for the message interface

342
00:19:31,800 --> 00:19:33,720
and now everything will be much easier

343
00:19:33,720 --> 00:19:37,500
because I know what to expect so I refer

344
00:19:37,500 --> 00:19:41,460
to day a messages collection add this

345
00:19:41,460 --> 00:19:44,040
data is that is from here the text is

346
00:19:44,040 --> 00:19:48,330
the input of the input is the value of

347
00:19:48,330 --> 00:19:49,980
the input and the date is just the date

348
00:19:49,980 --> 00:19:53,010
and if it succeeds do this if it fails

349
00:19:53,010 --> 00:19:56,340
do that okay let's now see it in action

350
00:19:56,340 --> 00:20:02,610
I'll start inspector okay I hope you can

351
00:20:02,610 --> 00:20:07,530
all see it and if I do one two three

352
00:20:07,530 --> 00:20:10,680
I'll send it this is not the control

353
00:20:10,680 --> 00:20:13,050
gray document written with the ID now

354
00:20:13,050 --> 00:20:16,530
let's go visit the console we'll go to

355
00:20:16,530 --> 00:20:23,110
the database and you can

356
00:20:23,110 --> 00:20:24,940
I have a messages collection oh there's

357
00:20:24,940 --> 00:20:27,280
a few other ones I did earlier sorry

358
00:20:27,280 --> 00:20:31,540
but you can see it's here so okay this

359
00:20:31,540 --> 00:20:33,940
is nice but I want to make things a bit

360
00:20:33,940 --> 00:20:36,790
more interesting let's make things a bit

361
00:20:36,790 --> 00:20:40,870
more interesting okay so putting data in

362
00:20:40,870 --> 00:20:43,030
the database that I didn't created it's

363
00:20:43,030 --> 00:20:45,490
super fun super easy but let's take it

364
00:20:45,490 --> 00:20:48,190
to the next level I'll go back to the

365
00:20:48,190 --> 00:20:51,549
HTML and I'll add a list here now this

366
00:20:51,549 --> 00:20:53,440
is the angular way of iterating over

367
00:20:53,440 --> 00:20:56,620
object usually arrays but what I'm

368
00:20:56,620 --> 00:20:58,900
iterating over right now is not an error

369
00:20:58,900 --> 00:21:01,419
you see the dollar sign this is a

370
00:21:01,419 --> 00:21:03,250
convention meaning that this is an

371
00:21:03,250 --> 00:21:05,620
observable and observable is a contract

372
00:21:05,620 --> 00:21:07,870
between the back end and the front end

373
00:21:07,870 --> 00:21:13,000
that keeps the fronton updated with any

374
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:14,919
changes that happened on the back end

375
00:21:14,919 --> 00:21:17,110
let's see how I set it up so I'll click

376
00:21:17,110 --> 00:21:20,950
it and you can see I first I just say

377
00:21:20,950 --> 00:21:22,750
it's an observable type I'm not

378
00:21:22,750 --> 00:21:24,640
initializing it I'm just saying this is

379
00:21:24,640 --> 00:21:27,340
of a type observable that carries the

380
00:21:27,340 --> 00:21:29,950
payload of the observable is an array of

381
00:21:29,950 --> 00:21:32,590
message you remember I a setup message

382
00:21:32,590 --> 00:21:35,740
earlier now let's see how I initialize

383
00:21:35,740 --> 00:21:39,360
this message I say this message is equal

384
00:21:39,360 --> 00:21:42,970
this DB you remember the DB object you

385
00:21:42,970 --> 00:21:45,190
remember the collection method again I'm

386
00:21:45,190 --> 00:21:46,630
referring to the same collection

387
00:21:46,630 --> 00:21:48,730
messages now I'm passing a query

388
00:21:48,730 --> 00:21:50,559
function I'll talk it in a second but

389
00:21:50,559 --> 00:21:54,490
earlier if you remember I used the add

390
00:21:54,490 --> 00:21:57,070
method now for the collection I'm using

391
00:21:57,070 --> 00:21:59,140
the value changes method what the value

392
00:21:59,140 --> 00:22:01,419
changes method does it returns an

393
00:22:01,419 --> 00:22:05,290
observable which I can later use in my

394
00:22:05,290 --> 00:22:08,559
HTML using the a sync pipe I think type

395
00:22:08,559 --> 00:22:11,290
in vs. enforces that contract I told you

396
00:22:11,290 --> 00:22:13,570
which means any changes that happens

397
00:22:13,570 --> 00:22:16,480
here a implement them on the UI

398
00:22:16,480 --> 00:22:18,220
immediately now let's see it in action

399
00:22:18,220 --> 00:22:21,630
I'll save it I'll go back to here and

400
00:22:21,630 --> 00:22:28,059
here are the messages hello and I'll

401
00:22:28,059 --> 00:22:31,000
send it down and you can see it here

402
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:34,300
okay this is a

403
00:22:34,300 --> 00:22:36,580
better but now everyone I want your

404
00:22:36,580 --> 00:22:38,140
attention please I want your attention

405
00:22:38,140 --> 00:22:41,320
and close the clash Royale of a candy

406
00:22:41,320 --> 00:22:44,800
crush I need you here right now I want

407
00:22:44,800 --> 00:22:49,060
you all if you be so kind to go into

408
00:22:49,060 --> 00:22:51,790
this a URL I'll also share it on my

409
00:22:51,790 --> 00:22:58,060
Twitter one second there you go but

410
00:22:58,060 --> 00:23:01,090
please I'm asking you all to a open your

411
00:23:01,090 --> 00:23:03,730
browser or take out your iPhones or

412
00:23:03,730 --> 00:23:06,340
whatever else you have and going into

413
00:23:06,340 --> 00:23:09,310
this a URL cos then you can see the real

414
00:23:09,310 --> 00:23:13,980
magic that firebase say allows you to do

415
00:23:13,980 --> 00:23:15,390
okay

416
00:23:15,390 --> 00:23:18,280
it's hard without any feedback but I'm

417
00:23:18,280 --> 00:23:22,900
assuming you're all inside all the talks

418
00:23:22,900 --> 00:23:26,620
that web apps and here's the QR code if

419
00:23:26,620 --> 00:23:33,610
you want and let's see ah there you go

420
00:23:33,610 --> 00:23:36,370
ding ding dong attention please hello

421
00:23:36,370 --> 00:23:40,090
BAM this is my lose all your base

422
00:23:40,090 --> 00:23:44,640
are belong to us so sad hey how are you

423
00:23:44,640 --> 00:23:47,670
right electric gun thank you listening

424
00:23:47,670 --> 00:23:50,470
ok I'll let you all enjoy it and I'll

425
00:23:50,470 --> 00:23:53,020
talk for a second on what we did here we

426
00:23:53,020 --> 00:23:56,230
it was like what six seven lines of code

427
00:23:56,230 --> 00:23:59,110
and we created a live chat without

428
00:23:59,110 --> 00:24:02,320
worrying about all the unbelievably hard

429
00:24:02,320 --> 00:24:06,460
things that usually are connected to

430
00:24:06,460 --> 00:24:08,770
such a project what about security

431
00:24:08,770 --> 00:24:11,350
okay first of all if you'll try to do am

432
00:24:11,350 --> 00:24:15,250
a XSS hack you won't be able because

433
00:24:15,250 --> 00:24:18,490
angular sanitizes hacking nice but this

434
00:24:18,490 --> 00:24:20,800
is not on a script but Ambrose sanitizes

435
00:24:20,800 --> 00:24:22,930
all the HTML so you don't need to worry

436
00:24:22,930 --> 00:24:26,110
about it eh but who's allowed to write

437
00:24:26,110 --> 00:24:29,080
things here that's another a permission

438
00:24:29,080 --> 00:24:30,820
or authorization issue I'll talk to

439
00:24:30,820 --> 00:24:35,320
about it in a second um but look how I

440
00:24:35,320 --> 00:24:38,500
created a live chat that as far as I

441
00:24:38,500 --> 00:24:41,410
care a thousand people can go inside

442
00:24:41,410 --> 00:24:42,970
right now and it doesn't really matter

443
00:24:42,970 --> 00:24:46,580
everything works with zero a

444
00:24:46,580 --> 00:24:49,940
effort in my part also another reuniting

445
00:24:49,940 --> 00:24:53,210
you should take a look at a I if you

446
00:24:53,210 --> 00:24:57,350
remember I earlier said I injected a few

447
00:24:57,350 --> 00:25:01,160
way I imported a few modules so in a not

448
00:25:01,160 --> 00:25:05,930
only then a the the big module the a

449
00:25:05,930 --> 00:25:08,720
home module of the angular file base but

450
00:25:08,720 --> 00:25:10,820
also the analytics module I just

451
00:25:10,820 --> 00:25:13,460
imported it I didn't set up anything and

452
00:25:13,460 --> 00:25:15,200
before take a look at the analytics

453
00:25:15,200 --> 00:25:22,970
real-time okay what only two people know

454
00:25:22,970 --> 00:25:31,000
that can be right trying refresh that as

455
00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:34,550
I said what but I see so many points

456
00:25:34,550 --> 00:25:36,710
here how well do they say it - okay I

457
00:25:36,710 --> 00:25:40,280
see we have people from Atlanta and they

458
00:25:40,280 --> 00:25:47,720
from London what's that Kent okay Paris

459
00:25:47,720 --> 00:25:50,060
hi Paris and this is so much I hope I

460
00:25:50,060 --> 00:25:52,160
can visit soon okay I'm not sure what

461
00:25:52,160 --> 00:25:55,100
white says only two but obviously it

462
00:25:55,100 --> 00:25:58,280
does work and we have statistics amazing

463
00:25:58,280 --> 00:26:00,200
laughing it what's your Twitter account

464
00:26:00,200 --> 00:26:07,610
to follow you my Twitter is done from

465
00:26:07,610 --> 00:26:10,070
Paris right that's my Twitter account

466
00:26:10,070 --> 00:26:19,310
hope so aim yeah okay so where were we

467
00:26:19,310 --> 00:26:21,950
and we don't have a lot of time left of

468
00:26:21,950 --> 00:26:24,200
course I always do that let's go over

469
00:26:24,200 --> 00:26:26,300
the rest of the presentation really fast

470
00:26:26,300 --> 00:26:29,240
I loved you saying in mode okay we're

471
00:26:29,240 --> 00:26:37,400
back on guys so here are a few resources

472
00:26:37,400 --> 00:26:38,930
I'll send you the link today a

473
00:26:38,930 --> 00:26:41,810
presentation later so you can use it but

474
00:26:41,810 --> 00:26:44,390
I really recommend you not just

475
00:26:44,390 --> 00:26:46,370
listening to me talk about it that's

476
00:26:46,370 --> 00:26:48,440
nice and everything but I really think

477
00:26:48,440 --> 00:26:50,450
you should find a project something you

478
00:26:50,450 --> 00:26:52,370
like and dig into it it's really fun

479
00:26:52,370 --> 00:26:55,390
it's easy to create it's easy to make a

480
00:26:55,390 --> 00:26:59,510
data structure as I said it's a noise

481
00:26:59,510 --> 00:27:00,350
it's a

482
00:27:00,350 --> 00:27:02,630
north qlae database so it's based on

483
00:27:02,630 --> 00:27:04,669
documents documents are a simple

484
00:27:04,669 --> 00:27:06,350
javascript object it could be a flat

485
00:27:06,350 --> 00:27:08,720
object it could be a nested object and

486
00:27:08,720 --> 00:27:10,460
you can refer to it either by the way

487
00:27:10,460 --> 00:27:12,769
you've seen earlier collections and a

488
00:27:12,769 --> 00:27:17,360
doc inside the collection or just a just

489
00:27:17,360 --> 00:27:20,029
a go directly to the doc but see how I

490
00:27:20,029 --> 00:27:22,820
can also use it to pass variables so it

491
00:27:22,820 --> 00:27:25,460
makes it really powerful and strong you

492
00:27:25,460 --> 00:27:26,960
can also refer to an entire collection

493
00:27:26,960 --> 00:27:29,509
like I did earlier with the messages you

494
00:27:29,509 --> 00:27:31,549
can also use sub collection which is

495
00:27:31,549 --> 00:27:33,919
really really useful when you do for

496
00:27:33,919 --> 00:27:37,309
example multi-tenant a a product like us

497
00:27:37,309 --> 00:27:40,580
in UVI a queries you can make really

498
00:27:40,580 --> 00:27:42,740
complex queries they do have some

499
00:27:42,740 --> 00:27:44,629
limitation I don't have time to get into

500
00:27:44,629 --> 00:27:47,629
it but believe me you can overcome it on

501
00:27:47,629 --> 00:27:51,019
the UI you can order and limit you can

502
00:27:51,019 --> 00:27:52,309
create paginations

503
00:27:52,309 --> 00:27:54,379
again really nice and easy authorization

504
00:27:54,379 --> 00:27:57,440
oh give me one more second I want to

505
00:27:57,440 --> 00:27:58,970
show you something really cool I almost

506
00:27:58,970 --> 00:28:02,419
forgot ok let's go back to the code for

507
00:28:02,419 --> 00:28:05,000
a second I also created this really nice

508
00:28:05,000 --> 00:28:07,330
little a component called after login

509
00:28:07,330 --> 00:28:09,889
let's see it in action for a second -

510
00:28:09,889 --> 00:28:13,580
Brazil hello anonymous let me just log

511
00:28:13,580 --> 00:28:15,789
out for a second okay now I'm anonymous

512
00:28:15,789 --> 00:28:22,960
let's sign in and it opens day a Google

513
00:28:22,960 --> 00:28:27,889
authorization login and it says hi Dan

514
00:28:27,889 --> 00:28:31,690
Qin now I'm logged into my application

515
00:28:31,690 --> 00:28:34,970
how did I create the face the Facebook

516
00:28:34,970 --> 00:28:37,399
or Google what have you login so easily

517
00:28:37,399 --> 00:28:39,679
it's amazing let's just take a sneak

518
00:28:39,679 --> 00:28:43,490
peek at this component the HTML has two

519
00:28:43,490 --> 00:28:45,529
parts this is the angular way of doing

520
00:28:45,529 --> 00:28:48,169
if if the user is logged in then show

521
00:28:48,169 --> 00:28:50,570
this if not show hello anonymous and

522
00:28:50,570 --> 00:28:53,120
allow the user to click and sign in

523
00:28:53,120 --> 00:28:56,029
let's see this sign-in method it's one

524
00:28:56,029 --> 00:28:58,850
line people it's one line I signed into

525
00:28:58,850 --> 00:29:00,710
this application with a single line of

526
00:29:00,710 --> 00:29:03,200
code this is how it should be it's

527
00:29:03,200 --> 00:29:06,679
really a nice really easy a I really

528
00:29:06,679 --> 00:29:08,269
recommend the same thing goes with the

529
00:29:08,269 --> 00:29:11,809
sign out method hey let's go back to the

530
00:29:11,809 --> 00:29:13,779
presentation okay

531
00:29:13,779 --> 00:29:18,269
we have the authorization you can also a

532
00:29:18,269 --> 00:29:21,129
granulate the authorization to read and

533
00:29:21,129 --> 00:29:24,190
writes and even more complex to create

534
00:29:24,190 --> 00:29:26,739
or update or delete each could have its

535
00:29:26,739 --> 00:29:29,049
own permission you can use permission

536
00:29:29,049 --> 00:29:35,889
and to check to check the user ID if it

537
00:29:35,889 --> 00:29:38,369
even logged in or not you can use it a

538
00:29:38,369 --> 00:29:41,349
based on properties of the object the

539
00:29:41,349 --> 00:29:46,839
user tries to a-ok

540
00:29:46,839 --> 00:29:50,109
and I say we're out of time I didn't

541
00:29:50,109 --> 00:29:51,759
show you functions ok functions are the

542
00:29:51,759 --> 00:29:54,190
best part you see you see how each and

543
00:29:54,190 --> 00:29:56,200
every messages ends with the exclamation

544
00:29:56,200 --> 00:29:58,450
point it's not just because we're also

545
00:29:58,450 --> 00:30:01,059
happy it's also because I've created a

546
00:30:01,059 --> 00:30:04,719
really powerful tool I used a really

547
00:30:04,719 --> 00:30:06,669
powerful tool called functions cloud

548
00:30:06,669 --> 00:30:08,830
functions let's take a quick look at it

549
00:30:08,830 --> 00:30:11,799
I have a add exclamation function this

550
00:30:11,799 --> 00:30:15,669
all is boilerplate not really important

551
00:30:15,669 --> 00:30:17,589
this what it means that when this

552
00:30:17,589 --> 00:30:19,749
document the messages documents a

553
00:30:19,749 --> 00:30:22,929
collection is a when you create a new

554
00:30:22,929 --> 00:30:25,419
document in the messages collection run

555
00:30:25,419 --> 00:30:28,210
this code now this code takes the value

556
00:30:28,210 --> 00:30:31,210
it takes the text property and simply

557
00:30:31,210 --> 00:30:33,549
adds the exclamation and writes it back

558
00:30:33,549 --> 00:30:35,859
that's it but it gives you a hint of how

559
00:30:35,859 --> 00:30:41,109
powerful a functions can be you can have

560
00:30:41,109 --> 00:30:43,330
all kinds of a triggers you can use it

561
00:30:43,330 --> 00:30:47,109
to notify people of messages once check

562
00:30:47,109 --> 00:30:50,200
messages for example mentions them you

563
00:30:50,200 --> 00:30:52,539
can use it to sanitize messages you can

564
00:30:52,539 --> 00:30:55,239
use it to a process images like we do it

565
00:30:55,239 --> 00:30:59,889
in UVI or the afikoman you can use it to

566
00:30:59,889 --> 00:31:02,529
a pushing messages to slack there's a

567
00:31:02,529 --> 00:31:06,669
lot of cool items and again I'm sorry

568
00:31:06,669 --> 00:31:09,759
we're out of time but I'll share this

569
00:31:09,759 --> 00:31:11,710
entire presentation and the code base to

570
00:31:11,710 --> 00:31:13,749
it the check you've just seen

571
00:31:13,749 --> 00:31:16,809
I was dunking thank you so much I hope

572
00:31:16,809 --> 00:31:18,909
we have some time for questions thank

573
00:31:18,909 --> 00:31:20,830
you yeah we can we can do we did a

574
00:31:20,830 --> 00:31:22,149
couple of questions already through the

575
00:31:22,149 --> 00:31:24,339
three through your demo which is pretty

576
00:31:24,339 --> 00:31:26,649
pretty sweet so we can do since since we

577
00:31:26,649 --> 00:31:27,640
dropped a little bit

578
00:31:27,640 --> 00:31:29,800
midway through or we can we can do some

579
00:31:29,800 --> 00:31:32,410
extra questions so please since it's a

580
00:31:32,410 --> 00:31:34,270
meal time after that anyway so if you

581
00:31:34,270 --> 00:31:35,560
have questions please do ping them now

582
00:31:35,560 --> 00:31:37,810
there's one question in your demo as

583
00:31:37,810 --> 00:31:40,990
well which is didi to find a domain in

584
00:31:40,990 --> 00:31:42,700
firebase how do you get the link all the

585
00:31:42,700 --> 00:31:45,490
talk store web app can you believe it's

586
00:31:45,490 --> 00:31:47,350
free it's it's unbelievable let's take a

587
00:31:47,350 --> 00:31:49,990
quick look at the console and if I'll go

588
00:31:49,990 --> 00:31:54,310
to hosting you can see that you get the

589
00:31:54,310 --> 00:31:58,510
a basic a native URL and you can also

590
00:31:58,510 --> 00:32:01,420
create your very own you're sorry

591
00:32:01,420 --> 00:32:03,880
create your very own URLs it's really

592
00:32:03,880 --> 00:32:06,730
easy and you can also attach your very

593
00:32:06,730 --> 00:32:10,870
own website I'm on the free plan so I

594
00:32:10,870 --> 00:32:13,810
can't but for the afikomen for example I

595
00:32:13,810 --> 00:32:18,190
used it on coin comm so yeah you can

596
00:32:18,190 --> 00:32:22,770
attach a new all else really really easy

597
00:32:22,770 --> 00:32:26,620
looks good a question from your on the

598
00:32:26,620 --> 00:32:29,440
BA how does angular observe the changes

599
00:32:29,440 --> 00:32:32,350
in the collection in real time I'll tell

600
00:32:32,350 --> 00:32:36,190
you the truth I don't know I'm sure they

601
00:32:36,190 --> 00:32:38,650
have some kind of a socket logic behind

602
00:32:38,650 --> 00:32:43,780
the scenes with a caching and they also

603
00:32:43,780 --> 00:32:46,870
have an offline mode to keep your

604
00:32:46,870 --> 00:32:49,210
changes and push them once you log in

605
00:32:49,210 --> 00:32:51,910
but basically I don't care it and

606
00:32:51,910 --> 00:32:54,130
neither should you that's the amazing

607
00:32:54,130 --> 00:32:56,170
thing about that's why I like it so much

608
00:32:56,170 --> 00:33:00,670
I want an object to a reflect the

609
00:33:00,670 --> 00:33:02,950
changes I have in my database how it

610
00:33:02,950 --> 00:33:05,350
creates the object how it reflects the

611
00:33:05,350 --> 00:33:08,430
it changes I honestly don't care and

612
00:33:08,430 --> 00:33:10,090
neither should you

613
00:33:10,090 --> 00:33:12,820
look how easy it is I'm saying populate

614
00:33:12,820 --> 00:33:16,090
this message observable with this

615
00:33:16,090 --> 00:33:18,640
enigmatic value changes I don't even

616
00:33:18,640 --> 00:33:20,530
know why they call it very change what I

617
00:33:20,530 --> 00:33:22,900
do know it returns an observable that I

618
00:33:22,900 --> 00:33:25,360
can put in my HTML and using this I

619
00:33:25,360 --> 00:33:28,420
think pipe create a contract that every

620
00:33:28,420 --> 00:33:30,700
time something changes in the backend it

621
00:33:30,700 --> 00:33:34,060
changes in my UI so answering your

622
00:33:34,060 --> 00:33:36,720
questions I don't know but I don't care

623
00:33:36,720 --> 00:33:40,420
good answer good answer yeah really

624
00:33:40,420 --> 00:33:41,500
