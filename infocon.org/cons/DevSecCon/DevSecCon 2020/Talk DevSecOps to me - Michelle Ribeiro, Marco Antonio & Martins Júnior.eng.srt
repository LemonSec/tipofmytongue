1
00:00:00,320 --> 00:00:03,520
hi everyone how are you today

2
00:00:03,520 --> 00:00:06,080
it's around 6 00 a.m here in brazil and

3
00:00:06,080 --> 00:00:08,480
i am super excited to be here

4
00:00:08,480 --> 00:00:10,080
introducing you to the world of

5
00:00:10,080 --> 00:00:12,000
devsecops

6
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:15,280
but first i want to thank all the

7
00:00:15,280 --> 00:00:18,720
organizers the sponsors and speakers for

8
00:00:18,720 --> 00:00:19,039
the

9
00:00:19,039 --> 00:00:21,359
hard work they have put in in the last

10
00:00:21,359 --> 00:00:22,480
days to bring

11
00:00:22,480 --> 00:00:25,840
all the talks alive to me it's

12
00:00:25,840 --> 00:00:28,560
an honor to be around so many incredible

13
00:00:28,560 --> 00:00:29,439
names

14
00:00:29,439 --> 00:00:32,000
and i don't know if i even have the

15
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:34,640
right clothes to be around them

16
00:00:34,640 --> 00:00:37,280
but i guess that's who are current

17
00:00:37,280 --> 00:00:38,239
situations

18
00:00:38,239 --> 00:00:42,399
pajamas are okay right

19
00:00:42,800 --> 00:00:45,840
i also want to show my appreciation to

20
00:00:45,840 --> 00:00:49,200
all the essential workers

21
00:00:49,200 --> 00:00:51,680
working and risking their lives to save

22
00:00:51,680 --> 00:00:52,320
so many of

23
00:00:52,320 --> 00:00:57,440
us uh thank you so much we appreciate

24
00:00:57,440 --> 00:01:00,239
please be a hero as well and stay at

25
00:01:00,239 --> 00:01:00,719
home

26
00:01:00,719 --> 00:01:03,840
for us and for them

27
00:01:03,840 --> 00:01:06,799
uh finally i want to remember you that

28
00:01:06,799 --> 00:01:08,400
other talks are free

29
00:01:08,400 --> 00:01:11,280
but all the sponsorship we received

30
00:01:11,280 --> 00:01:12,640
thank you so much

31
00:01:12,640 --> 00:01:14,640
and all the voluntary donations you are

32
00:01:14,640 --> 00:01:16,720
going to do during this day

33
00:01:16,720 --> 00:01:18,880
are going straight to the world health

34
00:01:18,880 --> 00:01:21,439
organization to help the fight against

35
00:01:21,439 --> 00:01:24,880
convict 19. okay

36
00:01:24,880 --> 00:01:28,720
let's start first a little bit about me

37
00:01:28,720 --> 00:01:32,240
i am the cio of spiritseki a brazilian

38
00:01:32,240 --> 00:01:35,360
security council and i work as

39
00:01:35,360 --> 00:01:39,360
an infrasec pro since so much time

40
00:01:39,360 --> 00:01:41,920
i am also a member of the devops days

41
00:01:41,920 --> 00:01:42,640
community

42
00:01:42,640 --> 00:01:44,880
the linux professional institute and the

43
00:01:44,880 --> 00:01:46,399
dublin project

44
00:01:46,399 --> 00:01:48,240
where i start to learn about security

45
00:01:48,240 --> 00:01:50,479
translating the diamond security manual

46
00:01:50,479 --> 00:01:52,880
to portuguese

47
00:01:52,880 --> 00:01:56,000
i also have a b site where i

48
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:57,600
advise governments concerning

49
00:01:57,600 --> 00:01:59,119
international security

50
00:01:59,119 --> 00:02:03,280
and technologies but enough about me

51
00:02:03,280 --> 00:02:06,320
what is devsecops

52
00:02:06,320 --> 00:02:09,440
well 10 years into the devsa

53
00:02:09,440 --> 00:02:13,040
devops uh movement and i am just

54
00:02:13,040 --> 00:02:15,200
got and i just got on board on the

55
00:02:15,200 --> 00:02:16,879
devsecops one

56
00:02:16,879 --> 00:02:20,160
i'm sure i am not the only one out there

57
00:02:20,160 --> 00:02:22,239
and you believe i could share my

58
00:02:22,239 --> 00:02:23,440
learning experience

59
00:02:23,440 --> 00:02:25,920
so you could better enjoy all the

60
00:02:25,920 --> 00:02:27,840
amazing talks we are going to have in

61
00:02:27,840 --> 00:02:29,440
the next hour such as

62
00:02:29,440 --> 00:02:32,959
the box and security cows engineer

63
00:02:32,959 --> 00:02:35,599
and believe me they are doing devops

64
00:02:35,599 --> 00:02:36,720
website cops

65
00:02:36,720 --> 00:02:40,000
with patrick dubois so

66
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:43,440
what is devsecops

67
00:02:45,200 --> 00:02:47,519
a really straightforward explanation of

68
00:02:47,519 --> 00:02:49,120
this term came from

69
00:02:49,120 --> 00:02:52,319
guy pejani he's the cio of

70
00:02:52,319 --> 00:02:55,680
snake and on a talk he delivered

71
00:02:55,680 --> 00:02:58,000
last year he showed us the three phase

72
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:01,280
of devs a cops

73
00:03:01,840 --> 00:03:05,440
if devops can be divided into three

74
00:03:05,440 --> 00:03:08,640
main principles devops culture

75
00:03:08,640 --> 00:03:12,480
rapid change sharing ownership

76
00:03:12,480 --> 00:03:14,640
devops methodologies such as

77
00:03:14,640 --> 00:03:16,080
microservice

78
00:03:16,080 --> 00:03:19,280
apis cicg pipelines

79
00:03:19,280 --> 00:03:21,680
and devops technologies such as

80
00:03:21,680 --> 00:03:23,840
containers clouds

81
00:03:23,840 --> 00:03:26,879
then somehow devsecops

82
00:03:26,879 --> 00:03:30,720
has to mean to include security into

83
00:03:30,720 --> 00:03:34,000
the diverse future secure devops

84
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:35,120
methodologies

85
00:03:35,120 --> 00:03:38,799
and secure devops tools

86
00:03:38,799 --> 00:03:44,159
very straightforward right okay but how

87
00:03:45,120 --> 00:03:48,000
to better understand his this he has to

88
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:49,840
go back to

89
00:03:49,840 --> 00:03:53,760
the way he used to think about security

90
00:03:53,760 --> 00:03:57,439
during the waterfall days uh infosec

91
00:03:57,439 --> 00:04:00,239
the infosection were like the gate

92
00:04:00,239 --> 00:04:00,879
keepers

93
00:04:00,879 --> 00:04:03,599
before a role is related to the final

94
00:04:03,599 --> 00:04:04,879
stages of the

95
00:04:04,879 --> 00:04:08,799
development you can see this on the

96
00:04:08,799 --> 00:04:12,159
pipeline in the top

97
00:04:12,159 --> 00:04:14,159
he used to have a scheduled security

98
00:04:14,159 --> 00:04:16,079
audit that revealed

99
00:04:16,079 --> 00:04:18,880
the code but only after everything was

100
00:04:18,880 --> 00:04:19,839
finished

101
00:04:19,839 --> 00:04:22,160
uh the substitution was against some

102
00:04:22,160 --> 00:04:22,960
predefined

103
00:04:22,960 --> 00:04:26,479
list of requirements uh later

104
00:04:26,479 --> 00:04:30,080
days or weeks a pdf report with hundreds

105
00:04:30,080 --> 00:04:32,160
of pages that people only read the

106
00:04:32,160 --> 00:04:33,600
conclusion

107
00:04:33,600 --> 00:04:36,479
went to the sea level executives take

108
00:04:36,479 --> 00:04:38,000
another pair of

109
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:40,720
days or weeks to reach the developers

110
00:04:40,720 --> 00:04:42,800
and the rest of the two

111
00:04:42,800 --> 00:04:45,520
in this scenario the two failed to

112
00:04:45,520 --> 00:04:47,840
implement the necessary educations

113
00:04:47,840 --> 00:04:50,880
making the company lose time and money

114
00:04:50,880 --> 00:04:53,680
but not separating the security code

115
00:04:53,680 --> 00:04:54,400
from the

116
00:04:54,400 --> 00:04:57,759
unapproved one or sometimes the software

117
00:04:57,759 --> 00:04:58,880
was launched

118
00:04:58,880 --> 00:05:01,840
a even with other venerabilities and

119
00:05:01,840 --> 00:05:03,600
when the corrections reached the

120
00:05:03,600 --> 00:05:07,120
roadmap the coders arrived

121
00:05:07,120 --> 00:05:12,560
old or maybe even was explored

122
00:05:12,960 --> 00:05:15,680
there's so many aspects of the devops

123
00:05:15,680 --> 00:05:16,560
culture that is

124
00:05:16,560 --> 00:05:19,600
important to secured but due to your

125
00:05:19,600 --> 00:05:21,520
time let's concentrate in

126
00:05:21,520 --> 00:05:25,360
children there are really important

127
00:05:25,360 --> 00:05:28,160
the concept of shift left and shared

128
00:05:28,160 --> 00:05:30,639
ownership

129
00:05:31,039 --> 00:05:33,680
the philosophy behind shift left is to

130
00:05:33,680 --> 00:05:34,320
introduce

131
00:05:34,320 --> 00:05:37,360
security scans into the beginning

132
00:05:37,360 --> 00:05:41,120
of the workflow into the end so

133
00:05:41,120 --> 00:05:43,520
he could find and fix vulnerability

134
00:05:43,520 --> 00:05:44,800
before the code

135
00:05:44,800 --> 00:05:48,080
is accepted into a build or into

136
00:05:48,080 --> 00:05:49,600
productions

137
00:05:49,600 --> 00:05:53,120
given feedback to developers so

138
00:05:53,120 --> 00:05:56,160
this professional can uh analyze

139
00:05:56,160 --> 00:05:59,919
the code or analyze the the container

140
00:05:59,919 --> 00:06:03,600
and fix the other vulnerabilities

141
00:06:03,600 --> 00:06:06,720
let's take a look on

142
00:06:06,720 --> 00:06:09,919
devsecops pipeline so

143
00:06:09,919 --> 00:06:13,039
usually a devops pipeline you

144
00:06:13,039 --> 00:06:17,360
make the test and when there is a

145
00:06:18,639 --> 00:06:21,680
failure on the process you shift left

146
00:06:21,680 --> 00:06:24,319
this means that you return to the person

147
00:06:24,319 --> 00:06:24,960
that

148
00:06:24,960 --> 00:06:28,000
uh made the

149
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:31,520
the pr right and from a secured

150
00:06:31,520 --> 00:06:33,360
standpoint of you

151
00:06:33,360 --> 00:06:36,720
it's the same belief if there is

152
00:06:36,720 --> 00:06:41,600
a security problem vulnerability

153
00:06:41,600 --> 00:06:46,080
the developer has to be able to

154
00:06:46,240 --> 00:06:49,520
announce make the analysis and fix it

155
00:06:49,520 --> 00:06:53,280
by itself another important

156
00:06:53,280 --> 00:06:56,479
uh cuter aspect is

157
00:06:56,479 --> 00:07:00,319
about shared ownership from the security

158
00:07:00,319 --> 00:07:02,080
standard point of view

159
00:07:02,080 --> 00:07:06,880
he her losing the world

160
00:07:07,120 --> 00:07:10,880
usually a dev option has a hundred labs

161
00:07:10,880 --> 00:07:13,599
10 knobs and just one security

162
00:07:13,599 --> 00:07:15,360
professional

163
00:07:15,360 --> 00:07:18,080
so he have to engage all the gym to work

164
00:07:18,080 --> 00:07:20,080
with the same mentality

165
00:07:20,080 --> 00:07:23,680
and to this to do this you have to be

166
00:07:23,680 --> 00:07:26,880
enablers and allow the

167
00:07:26,880 --> 00:07:29,680
dev and options to introduce security

168
00:07:29,680 --> 00:07:30,479
develop

169
00:07:30,479 --> 00:07:33,759
practices you can do that by

170
00:07:33,759 --> 00:07:37,280
for example creating a shared security

171
00:07:37,280 --> 00:07:40,479
library with mechanisms

172
00:07:40,479 --> 00:07:43,199
and tools

173
00:07:43,759 --> 00:07:47,120
such as authentication and incorporation

174
00:07:47,120 --> 00:07:48,080
service

175
00:07:48,080 --> 00:07:50,560
that are reads checked by the security

176
00:07:50,560 --> 00:07:51,520
team

177
00:07:51,520 --> 00:07:54,639
with everything available and easily say

178
00:07:54,639 --> 00:07:57,840
easily be searchable it's easier for

179
00:07:57,840 --> 00:08:00,879
developers and operators to reuse

180
00:08:00,879 --> 00:08:04,160
secure code so make their lives

181
00:08:04,160 --> 00:08:07,840
easier you can also curate

182
00:08:07,840 --> 00:08:10,800
a standard container image with the most

183
00:08:10,800 --> 00:08:11,280
used

184
00:08:11,280 --> 00:08:14,879
systems like a passion your database for

185
00:08:14,879 --> 00:08:17,120
example

186
00:08:17,120 --> 00:08:19,680
it's also a good practice to use the

187
00:08:19,680 --> 00:08:20,639
same devops

188
00:08:20,639 --> 00:08:23,520
tools to manage security shoes and

189
00:08:23,520 --> 00:08:24,400
events

190
00:08:24,400 --> 00:08:27,759
so everyone can see uh can have

191
00:08:27,759 --> 00:08:31,039
the visibility of what's going

192
00:08:31,039 --> 00:08:33,120
on around with the code and with the

193
00:08:33,120 --> 00:08:34,080
pipeline

194
00:08:34,080 --> 00:08:36,159
again from the security point standard

195
00:08:36,159 --> 00:08:38,000
of you

196
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:41,679
and finally uh the cuter of

197
00:08:41,679 --> 00:08:45,440
boss martin the infosec pros

198
00:08:45,440 --> 00:08:49,600
are really uh into postmortem

199
00:08:49,600 --> 00:08:52,839
this is something that he do all the

200
00:08:52,839 --> 00:08:54,000
time

201
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:59,519
so you can join the two chance together

202
00:08:59,519 --> 00:09:03,600
and check with the if the all the

203
00:09:03,600 --> 00:09:06,800
actions are been thinking

204
00:09:06,800 --> 00:09:11,440
to avoid the event to happen again

205
00:09:11,440 --> 00:09:13,839
are is everyone informed but then is the

206
00:09:13,839 --> 00:09:14,640
plan placed

207
00:09:14,640 --> 00:09:19,040
on the roadmap for the infosec

208
00:09:19,040 --> 00:09:21,120
professionals out there it's time for

209
00:09:21,120 --> 00:09:24,240
you to get on board with the program

210
00:09:24,240 --> 00:09:27,760
an easy way to do that is to adopt

211
00:09:27,760 --> 00:09:31,519
a securities code okay but isn't devs

212
00:09:31,519 --> 00:09:33,680
equal to the same thing as securities

213
00:09:33,680 --> 00:09:34,959
code

214
00:09:34,959 --> 00:09:38,000
i like to to make a separation between

215
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:38,959
the two terms

216
00:09:38,959 --> 00:09:42,160
because you can have security as code

217
00:09:42,160 --> 00:09:44,880
outside of a security file a devops

218
00:09:44,880 --> 00:09:46,320
pipeline right

219
00:09:46,320 --> 00:09:48,640
you can have securities code to do

220
00:09:48,640 --> 00:09:50,160
automations with

221
00:09:50,160 --> 00:09:53,680
ansible and chef to manage security

222
00:09:53,680 --> 00:09:55,760
appliances

223
00:09:55,760 --> 00:09:59,519
so devsecops is everything that

224
00:09:59,519 --> 00:10:03,839
makes devops everything that is related

225
00:10:03,839 --> 00:10:05,040
to your

226
00:10:05,040 --> 00:10:08,880
cicg platform for example

227
00:10:08,880 --> 00:10:12,320
to do this uh infosec plus have to learn

228
00:10:12,320 --> 00:10:13,279
how to program

229
00:10:13,279 --> 00:10:15,600
in python for example and see your

230
00:10:15,600 --> 00:10:17,680
configurations files as codes

231
00:10:17,680 --> 00:10:20,560
manage and then with a repository such

232
00:10:20,560 --> 00:10:20,880
as

233
00:10:20,880 --> 00:10:24,640
gitlab or github and in no time you'll

234
00:10:24,640 --> 00:10:26,800
be able to collaborate with the devops

235
00:10:26,800 --> 00:10:28,399
channels

236
00:10:28,399 --> 00:10:31,920
but remember devsecops is not only about

237
00:10:31,920 --> 00:10:32,560
tools but

238
00:10:32,560 --> 00:10:35,920
mainly about culture it's a about time

239
00:10:35,920 --> 00:10:38,480
infrastruct professionals to dive deep

240
00:10:38,480 --> 00:10:40,640
into the develop scooter and in its

241
00:10:40,640 --> 00:10:42,640
goals

242
00:10:42,640 --> 00:10:44,880
and if you are getting on board or

243
00:10:44,880 --> 00:10:47,120
helping someone to get on board

244
00:10:47,120 --> 00:10:49,200
give special attention to the concept of

245
00:10:49,200 --> 00:10:52,000
cict and continuous feedback

246
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:55,440
this is a challenge for us because pros

247
00:10:55,440 --> 00:10:58,880
uh because we are used to the mindset

248
00:10:58,880 --> 00:11:02,160
to have one vendor solution that

249
00:11:02,160 --> 00:11:05,519
would solve our security problems

250
00:11:05,519 --> 00:11:09,040
but it never did

251
00:11:11,279 --> 00:11:14,000
concern security how to secure develops

252
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:15,760
methodologies

253
00:11:15,760 --> 00:11:18,079
the agile and devops movements

254
00:11:18,079 --> 00:11:19,200
transformed

255
00:11:19,200 --> 00:11:22,079
developments methodologies and brought a

256
00:11:22,079 --> 00:11:24,399
whole new set of concepts such as

257
00:11:24,399 --> 00:11:28,240
microservice apis continuous pipelines

258
00:11:28,240 --> 00:11:31,360
containers and when the organizations

259
00:11:31,360 --> 00:11:32,399
decide

260
00:11:32,399 --> 00:11:35,839
also the cloud this of course is not an

261
00:11:35,839 --> 00:11:37,440
extensive list

262
00:11:37,440 --> 00:11:39,680
but i like to start to think about

263
00:11:39,680 --> 00:11:40,720
security

264
00:11:40,720 --> 00:11:43,360
concerning the forces because you have

265
00:11:43,360 --> 00:11:45,120
too many things to think about

266
00:11:45,120 --> 00:11:47,040
security when you are talking about

267
00:11:47,040 --> 00:11:48,399
devops so

268
00:11:48,399 --> 00:11:50,720
let's start small with the forces

269
00:11:50,720 --> 00:11:53,360
defined by the cloud native security

270
00:11:53,360 --> 00:11:58,560
code container cluster and cloud

271
00:11:58,959 --> 00:12:01,040
as you can see from the figure below

272
00:12:01,040 --> 00:12:03,040
each one of the forces

273
00:12:03,040 --> 00:12:05,600
depends on the security of the squares

274
00:12:05,600 --> 00:12:08,560
in which they fit

275
00:12:08,560 --> 00:12:11,600
if you secure only your code

276
00:12:11,600 --> 00:12:13,360
it's nearly impossible to think that you

277
00:12:13,360 --> 00:12:16,480
are secured enough

278
00:12:16,639 --> 00:12:19,600
it's possible to bring more security to

279
00:12:19,600 --> 00:12:21,360
the cicg

280
00:12:21,360 --> 00:12:24,320
methodology for example by automating

281
00:12:24,320 --> 00:12:25,839
code scanners

282
00:12:25,839 --> 00:12:28,959
in the preview phase you can use static

283
00:12:28,959 --> 00:12:32,320
analysis is a test that he performed

284
00:12:32,320 --> 00:12:36,399
in a known production environment a sas

285
00:12:36,399 --> 00:12:39,120
inspects the application code searching

286
00:12:39,120 --> 00:12:39,519
for

287
00:12:39,519 --> 00:12:43,680
flowers uh back doors and malwares

288
00:12:43,680 --> 00:12:46,959
uh some examples are siane curb

289
00:12:46,959 --> 00:12:50,399
it's uh industry standards and varicose

290
00:12:50,399 --> 00:12:51,120
as well

291
00:12:51,120 --> 00:12:55,040
and snake is a tool that's going

292
00:12:55,040 --> 00:12:58,399
that's growing in the market at this

293
00:12:58,399 --> 00:13:00,079
stage you can also check

294
00:13:00,079 --> 00:13:03,600
yeah some of your dependents

295
00:13:03,600 --> 00:13:08,560
you can check if they have any kind of

296
00:13:08,560 --> 00:13:13,120
uh vulnerabilities or malicious vinaires

297
00:13:13,120 --> 00:13:15,600
because these days most of the

298
00:13:15,600 --> 00:13:17,200
developers

299
00:13:17,200 --> 00:13:19,680
use helios code that they find on the

300
00:13:19,680 --> 00:13:21,680
internet or some of the libraries

301
00:13:21,680 --> 00:13:25,120
and apis are

302
00:13:25,360 --> 00:13:27,920
delivered by a vendor so it's a good

303
00:13:27,920 --> 00:13:31,120
practice to check them as well

304
00:13:31,120 --> 00:13:34,160
my industry uh standard tool is

305
00:13:34,160 --> 00:13:38,160
there was a dependence check um

306
00:13:38,160 --> 00:13:42,800
that you can integrate into your pi

307
00:13:42,800 --> 00:13:46,079
cic pipeline platform uh for example

308
00:13:46,079 --> 00:13:49,279
github which slab and the wasp

309
00:13:49,279 --> 00:13:50,720
independence check

310
00:13:50,720 --> 00:13:53,839
will uh through an api make all the

311
00:13:53,839 --> 00:13:55,120
tasks and

312
00:13:55,120 --> 00:13:57,920
if there is a failure you can uh

313
00:13:57,920 --> 00:13:59,120
configure it

314
00:13:59,120 --> 00:14:02,240
to open an issue on your

315
00:14:02,240 --> 00:14:06,240
github for example after deployment

316
00:14:06,240 --> 00:14:10,160
he can resort to a dynamic analysis test

317
00:14:10,160 --> 00:14:14,079
using a tool uh usually called dust

318
00:14:14,079 --> 00:14:17,360
and it emulates a type of

319
00:14:17,360 --> 00:14:21,040
penetration test from an outsider's

320
00:14:21,040 --> 00:14:24,079
stand point of view um

321
00:14:24,079 --> 00:14:27,600
it will make the same um scans

322
00:14:27,600 --> 00:14:31,199
that i invader will do

323
00:14:31,199 --> 00:14:34,639
and examples of those are the wasps

324
00:14:34,639 --> 00:14:40,560
aspie uh apathy scan or the matrix quite

325
00:14:40,560 --> 00:14:44,560
so again when you input security test

326
00:14:44,560 --> 00:14:46,480
inside the rcg

327
00:14:46,480 --> 00:14:50,240
cicg pipeline you

328
00:14:50,240 --> 00:14:53,600
automate this security test and you can

329
00:14:53,600 --> 00:14:58,480
if there is a failure shift left and ask

330
00:14:58,480 --> 00:15:01,760
the developers to fix them

331
00:15:01,760 --> 00:15:05,600
and i hope this may makes more clear

332
00:15:05,600 --> 00:15:09,920
what is adapts lack of pipeline

333
00:15:10,639 --> 00:15:14,240
is to concern code um for many

334
00:15:14,240 --> 00:15:17,680
organizations the cicg platform

335
00:15:17,680 --> 00:15:20,160
are the cornerstones of their devops

336
00:15:20,160 --> 00:15:21,199
strategies

337
00:15:21,199 --> 00:15:24,800
and security securing the two

338
00:15:24,800 --> 00:15:27,360
it's a essential it's essential and

339
00:15:27,360 --> 00:15:30,880
security code that hosts us

340
00:15:30,880 --> 00:15:33,920
it's also a great starting point uh to

341
00:15:33,920 --> 00:15:37,440
start adopting the culture of secure to

342
00:15:37,440 --> 00:15:40,000
share ownerships ownership with

343
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:42,160
developers

344
00:15:42,160 --> 00:15:45,279
since they are the primary users of a

345
00:15:45,279 --> 00:15:48,079
cicg platform

346
00:15:48,079 --> 00:15:51,279
together the sac gym and

347
00:15:51,279 --> 00:15:54,399
the dev option can create a story of the

348
00:15:54,399 --> 00:15:56,399
platform and how

349
00:15:56,399 --> 00:15:59,440
map how users could abuse the two

350
00:15:59,440 --> 00:16:04,480
and plan actions to minimize these risks

351
00:16:04,480 --> 00:16:06,800
then you can include these activities on

352
00:16:06,800 --> 00:16:08,639
the roadmap and

353
00:16:08,639 --> 00:16:10,639
when possible assign security

354
00:16:10,639 --> 00:16:11,920
responsibilities to

355
00:16:11,920 --> 00:16:15,920
the developers and operators

356
00:16:15,920 --> 00:16:19,040
and remember even if you use a

357
00:16:19,040 --> 00:16:22,480
sas a software as a service platform

358
00:16:22,480 --> 00:16:25,279
the provider is only responsible for the

359
00:16:25,279 --> 00:16:27,759
security of the environment

360
00:16:27,759 --> 00:16:31,199
the configuration of your instance

361
00:16:31,199 --> 00:16:33,600
is up to the administration you

362
00:16:33,600 --> 00:16:36,480
administrator you

363
00:16:36,480 --> 00:16:38,880
booked its lab in github and i'm sure

364
00:16:38,880 --> 00:16:39,920
all the other

365
00:16:39,920 --> 00:16:43,440
major uh platforms have secured centers

366
00:16:43,440 --> 00:16:46,160
with detailed uh documentation some

367
00:16:46,160 --> 00:16:46,959
trainings

368
00:16:46,959 --> 00:16:49,680
and how to reach the security channels

369
00:16:49,680 --> 00:16:50,160
so

370
00:16:50,160 --> 00:16:53,040
make sure you use and check them

371
00:16:53,040 --> 00:16:55,440
constantly

372
00:16:55,440 --> 00:16:58,399
okay let's go to our second see

373
00:16:58,399 --> 00:16:59,440
containers

374
00:16:59,440 --> 00:17:01,600
they are really important steps to

375
00:17:01,600 --> 00:17:04,240
improve the efficiency of application

376
00:17:04,240 --> 00:17:04,959
delivery

377
00:17:04,959 --> 00:17:08,480
and deployment a container in itself is

378
00:17:08,480 --> 00:17:09,359
considered

379
00:17:09,359 --> 00:17:12,240
a lighter form and a great alternative

380
00:17:12,240 --> 00:17:14,640
to creating a virtual machine

381
00:17:14,640 --> 00:17:18,640
okay i know this is over simplification

382
00:17:18,640 --> 00:17:21,599
due to the nature of containers

383
00:17:21,599 --> 00:17:22,559
developers can

384
00:17:22,559 --> 00:17:25,520
easily share images and all the

385
00:17:25,520 --> 00:17:27,039
dependencies

386
00:17:27,039 --> 00:17:29,760
of an application making it easy to to

387
00:17:29,760 --> 00:17:30,640
deploy

388
00:17:30,640 --> 00:17:33,919
and share with their uh operation teams

389
00:17:33,919 --> 00:17:35,360
for example

390
00:17:35,360 --> 00:17:38,160
eliminating smaller heroes around the

391
00:17:38,160 --> 00:17:39,200
famous phrase

392
00:17:39,200 --> 00:17:42,880
uh words on my computer containers

393
00:17:42,880 --> 00:17:45,440
in itself they are powerful security

394
00:17:45,440 --> 00:17:46,799
tools

395
00:17:46,799 --> 00:17:50,240
they are by design running with

396
00:17:50,240 --> 00:17:53,520
low levels of permissions and they also

397
00:17:53,520 --> 00:17:54,160
allow

398
00:17:54,160 --> 00:17:56,559
the standardizations of images on the

399
00:17:56,559 --> 00:17:59,679
state as i said

400
00:17:59,679 --> 00:18:02,880
but they will lose their power if the

401
00:18:02,880 --> 00:18:04,559
host operations

402
00:18:04,559 --> 00:18:08,080
system is not secure so remember

403
00:18:08,080 --> 00:18:11,200
the codes are so secure as the container

404
00:18:11,200 --> 00:18:13,280
and the container is so secure it's

405
00:18:13,280 --> 00:18:15,919
the cluster of the cloud where it's

406
00:18:15,919 --> 00:18:18,000
hosted

407
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:20,640
there is many images that are available

408
00:18:20,640 --> 00:18:21,440
there

409
00:18:21,440 --> 00:18:24,640
and it has become a security cliche

410
00:18:24,640 --> 00:18:28,080
to ask for moderation in news now of

411
00:18:28,080 --> 00:18:29,919
public images

412
00:18:29,919 --> 00:18:33,200
but and easily your channel should

413
00:18:33,200 --> 00:18:35,120
create their own images

414
00:18:35,120 --> 00:18:39,200
follow some safety recommendations

415
00:18:39,200 --> 00:18:42,840
at the center for internet security

416
00:18:42,840 --> 00:18:46,880
cis has a document called

417
00:18:46,880 --> 00:18:49,200
docker benchmark it's a reference

418
00:18:49,200 --> 00:18:51,600
document that can be used

419
00:18:51,600 --> 00:18:54,640
by system administration security and

420
00:18:54,640 --> 00:18:58,000
other ig professionals

421
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:00,320
to establish a security configuration

422
00:19:00,320 --> 00:19:01,440
baseline for

423
00:19:01,440 --> 00:19:04,960
docker containers and if you are going

424
00:19:04,960 --> 00:19:05,600
to use

425
00:19:05,600 --> 00:19:08,880
a docker available publicly

426
00:19:08,880 --> 00:19:11,360
you can record your tools like clary

427
00:19:11,360 --> 00:19:12,080
scanner

428
00:19:12,080 --> 00:19:15,679
that stands for vulnerability

429
00:19:15,679 --> 00:19:20,000
and docker bench for security

430
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:23,200
okay and to know if you have seen

431
00:19:23,200 --> 00:19:26,160
what is that cyclops how to introduce

432
00:19:26,160 --> 00:19:26,960
security

433
00:19:26,960 --> 00:19:30,240
to devops culture

434
00:19:30,240 --> 00:19:33,760
how to introduce secure into

435
00:19:33,760 --> 00:19:37,520
devops methodologies and we are going to

436
00:19:37,520 --> 00:19:39,760
concentrate on the courses

437
00:19:39,760 --> 00:19:43,200
code uh container

438
00:19:43,200 --> 00:19:45,840
cloud the clustering cloud until now we

439
00:19:45,840 --> 00:19:47,600
have seen

440
00:19:47,600 --> 00:19:51,120
how to make your code and your

441
00:19:51,120 --> 00:19:54,160
container more secure let's now go to

442
00:19:54,160 --> 00:19:58,559
the four or five the two final seas

443
00:19:58,559 --> 00:20:01,760
cluster and cloud

444
00:20:05,360 --> 00:20:08,159
devops culture and methodologies vary

445
00:20:08,159 --> 00:20:08,720
from

446
00:20:08,720 --> 00:20:12,080
company to company right but we can say

447
00:20:12,080 --> 00:20:17,120
about tools there if you only include

448
00:20:17,120 --> 00:20:20,799
the college options here the cognitive

449
00:20:20,799 --> 00:20:23,600
computing information for example it's

450
00:20:23,600 --> 00:20:24,880
so many projects

451
00:20:24,880 --> 00:20:27,679
that is virtually impossible to be a

452
00:20:27,679 --> 00:20:30,080
devop a devsecops engineer

453
00:20:30,080 --> 00:20:32,880
and know all the security configurations

454
00:20:32,880 --> 00:20:34,000
that you must do

455
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:38,480
for this project so

456
00:20:38,480 --> 00:20:41,039
let's go back to the cognitive security

457
00:20:41,039 --> 00:20:42,240
process

458
00:20:42,240 --> 00:20:48,480
code container close to an account

459
00:20:48,480 --> 00:20:51,600
so you can i i

460
00:20:51,600 --> 00:20:54,640
always do that i talk and forget to pass

461
00:20:54,640 --> 00:20:55,520
these lights

462
00:20:55,520 --> 00:20:58,720
so a simple uh pipeline

463
00:20:58,720 --> 00:21:01,039
a simple developed questionnaire line

464
00:21:01,039 --> 00:21:02,400
usually have this

465
00:21:02,400 --> 00:21:05,760
set of tools regarding the standards of

466
00:21:05,760 --> 00:21:09,120
devops but you can

467
00:21:09,120 --> 00:21:13,120
have all these options

468
00:21:13,120 --> 00:21:15,679
you have all these options in the market

469
00:21:15,679 --> 00:21:16,159
and

470
00:21:16,159 --> 00:21:20,720
then you can move to all the cognitive

471
00:21:20,720 --> 00:21:23,600
computing relations options here it's

472
00:21:23,600 --> 00:21:24,400
too many

473
00:21:24,400 --> 00:21:27,280
uh so many options we don't need others

474
00:21:27,280 --> 00:21:28,880
right

475
00:21:28,880 --> 00:21:31,360
but it's good because you can choose

476
00:21:31,360 --> 00:21:32,159
what it's

477
00:21:32,159 --> 00:21:35,919
right but what fits best for your

478
00:21:35,919 --> 00:21:38,480
company

479
00:21:39,440 --> 00:21:42,480
again in the situation of your cluster

480
00:21:42,480 --> 00:21:44,799
you have to remember once again that

481
00:21:44,799 --> 00:21:45,600
this will

482
00:21:45,600 --> 00:21:48,480
it will be as secure as your code your

483
00:21:48,480 --> 00:21:49,280
container

484
00:21:49,280 --> 00:21:51,919
and your cloud the cloud that posts look

485
00:21:51,919 --> 00:21:54,960
at the closer your coordinates

486
00:21:54,960 --> 00:21:57,200
the kubernetes security documentation

487
00:21:57,200 --> 00:21:59,280
please important sections such as

488
00:21:59,280 --> 00:22:02,880
controlling access to the colonizing api

489
00:22:02,880 --> 00:22:05,919
alloying restriction by users by network

490
00:22:05,919 --> 00:22:07,120
for example

491
00:22:07,120 --> 00:22:09,760
and controlling access to capability

492
00:22:09,760 --> 00:22:12,159
software workload

493
00:22:12,159 --> 00:22:15,280
or user at one time such as memory used

494
00:22:15,280 --> 00:22:16,640
to prevent

495
00:22:16,640 --> 00:22:20,480
an attack so make sure you check the

496
00:22:20,480 --> 00:22:22,320
security documentation

497
00:22:22,320 --> 00:22:28,000
and follow the procedures recommended

498
00:22:31,840 --> 00:22:35,200
so regarding our final sleep uh

499
00:22:35,200 --> 00:22:38,799
the card i think the

500
00:22:38,799 --> 00:22:41,840
best people to talk about their security

501
00:22:41,840 --> 00:22:44,880
is the providers and one

502
00:22:44,880 --> 00:22:46,960
thing that is really important to keep

503
00:22:46,960 --> 00:22:48,240
in mind is that

504
00:22:48,240 --> 00:22:51,840
uh security in the cloud is the same as

505
00:22:51,840 --> 00:22:56,559
security or data center um

506
00:22:56,559 --> 00:22:59,280
this is something that i copied copy and

507
00:22:59,280 --> 00:23:00,320
pasted

508
00:23:00,320 --> 00:23:04,720
from the aws future center

509
00:23:04,720 --> 00:23:07,600
make sure to check them and it says

510
00:23:07,600 --> 00:23:08,640
something

511
00:23:08,640 --> 00:23:11,600
very uh

512
00:23:11,760 --> 00:23:15,200
central to keep in mind

513
00:23:15,440 --> 00:23:18,400
customers you are responsible for

514
00:23:18,400 --> 00:23:19,280
security

515
00:23:19,280 --> 00:23:22,559
in the cloud and aws

516
00:23:22,559 --> 00:23:26,159
is responsible for security of the cloud

517
00:23:26,159 --> 00:23:30,000
uh is the same for google cloud

518
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:33,360
and other providers such as

519
00:23:33,360 --> 00:23:37,840
azure and so many others

520
00:23:37,919 --> 00:23:42,880
so make sure you check their security uh

521
00:23:42,880 --> 00:23:46,880
documentation scientists there is a

522
00:23:46,880 --> 00:23:50,159
good amount as usual of uh

523
00:23:50,159 --> 00:23:54,159
articles and phd practices and some have

524
00:23:54,159 --> 00:23:57,200
uh training i have to do uh

525
00:23:57,200 --> 00:23:59,600
in google institute training is all my

526
00:23:59,600 --> 00:24:00,799
tv list

527
00:24:00,799 --> 00:24:04,720
is the same for google cloud

528
00:24:04,720 --> 00:24:08,000
and of course you can also use a third

529
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:09,840
part

530
00:24:09,840 --> 00:24:12,799
tools to check with your tool if your

531
00:24:12,799 --> 00:24:13,840
cloud is

532
00:24:13,840 --> 00:24:17,279
a security map we have

533
00:24:17,279 --> 00:24:20,400
of course the magicfix gym

534
00:24:20,400 --> 00:24:23,360
the security monkey they have a very

535
00:24:23,360 --> 00:24:24,480
serious

536
00:24:24,480 --> 00:24:27,520
uh tools that they develop

537
00:24:27,520 --> 00:24:31,840
for interviews and that you can check

538
00:24:31,840 --> 00:24:35,120
also have a set to uh protected future

539
00:24:35,120 --> 00:24:35,520
and

540
00:24:35,520 --> 00:24:39,039
cloud exploit so i think

541
00:24:39,039 --> 00:24:41,919
i believe the main messages here is you

542
00:24:41,919 --> 00:24:42,159
are

543
00:24:42,159 --> 00:24:44,480
responsible for this issue of your

544
00:24:44,480 --> 00:24:46,480
thought of your

545
00:24:46,480 --> 00:24:49,120
the instance of your cloud for your data

546
00:24:49,120 --> 00:24:50,720
your users and

547
00:24:50,720 --> 00:24:54,000
their um your clinicians

548
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:57,600
and so many other things which tools

549
00:24:57,600 --> 00:24:59,679
connect to your cloud so

550
00:24:59,679 --> 00:25:02,880
keep this concerning in mind and engage

551
00:25:02,880 --> 00:25:03,520
your channel

552
00:25:03,520 --> 00:25:06,240
not just the security uh professional

553
00:25:06,240 --> 00:25:06,720
but

554
00:25:06,720 --> 00:25:10,320
other the development ops professionals

555
00:25:10,320 --> 00:25:11,120
as well

556
00:25:11,120 --> 00:25:13,840
and mapping this possible

557
00:25:13,840 --> 00:25:16,080
vulnerabilities

558
00:25:16,080 --> 00:25:18,720
and now i have reached the conclusion uh

559
00:25:18,720 --> 00:25:21,039
session of my talk

560
00:25:21,039 --> 00:25:24,240
i hope you have enjoyed as much as i did

561
00:25:24,240 --> 00:25:27,120
so uh to finish let's see our main

562
00:25:27,120 --> 00:25:29,840
takeaways from our sessions

563
00:25:29,840 --> 00:25:32,159
we have discovered what his website

564
00:25:32,159 --> 00:25:32,960
calls

565
00:25:32,960 --> 00:25:36,640
he also uh learned about the concept of

566
00:25:36,640 --> 00:25:39,360
shift left and that the security

567
00:25:39,360 --> 00:25:40,640
devsecops

568
00:25:40,640 --> 00:25:44,080
main goal should be to empower dev

569
00:25:44,080 --> 00:25:47,600
enops uh professionals to

570
00:25:47,600 --> 00:25:51,440
analyze and take security measures

571
00:25:51,440 --> 00:25:54,000
automation into the pipeline is also

572
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:55,039
important but

573
00:25:55,039 --> 00:25:58,320
the main goal should be empire uh your

574
00:25:58,320 --> 00:25:58,799
team

575
00:25:58,799 --> 00:26:01,360
because he are losing here just one and

576
00:26:01,360 --> 00:26:02,480
not enough

577
00:26:02,480 --> 00:26:05,760
a hundred for example uh he also learned

578
00:26:05,760 --> 00:26:06,880
about the concepts of

579
00:26:06,880 --> 00:26:10,159
rc's there is too much thing too much

580
00:26:10,159 --> 00:26:14,080
tools and methodologies to take care

581
00:26:14,080 --> 00:26:17,600
if you have to uh select a

582
00:26:17,600 --> 00:26:20,720
point of start a starting point go

583
00:26:20,720 --> 00:26:24,000
for the forces code and your

584
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:27,360
cicg platform as well that i

585
00:26:27,360 --> 00:26:29,440
believe is the same as your code

586
00:26:29,440 --> 00:26:30,559
container

587
00:26:30,559 --> 00:26:33,919
cluster and cloud

588
00:26:33,919 --> 00:26:37,440
and remember devs he really need your

589
00:26:37,440 --> 00:26:38,159
help

590
00:26:38,159 --> 00:26:41,600
uh so learn about secure development

591
00:26:41,600 --> 00:26:42,880
practices because

592
00:26:42,880 --> 00:26:46,320
this is going to be your concern

593
00:26:46,320 --> 00:26:49,760
from now on as well and

594
00:26:49,760 --> 00:26:52,720
for ops and sac it's time for us to get

595
00:26:52,720 --> 00:26:54,159
on board

596
00:26:54,159 --> 00:26:56,320

00:27:31,760 --> 00:27:35,360
let's see we have three minutes

611
00:27:35,360 --> 00:27:38,399
so i i saw that there are

612
00:27:38,399 --> 00:27:42,880

613
00:27:42,880 --> 00:27:47,200

614
00:27:47,520 --> 00:27:50,720

uh it's like okay uh

619
00:28:00,320 --> 00:28:03,520
i understand that culture is the key

620
00:28:03,520 --> 00:28:04,240
with the

621
00:28:04,240 --> 00:28:07,600
tafsir cups which is very hard to foster

622
00:28:07,600 --> 00:28:08,320
especially if

623
00:28:08,320 --> 00:28:10,559
your company has just started practicing

624
00:28:10,559 --> 00:28:11,520
devops

625
00:28:11,520 --> 00:28:13,279
do you have any suggestions that

626
00:28:13,279 --> 00:28:15,039
encourages this culture

627
00:28:15,039 --> 00:28:17,679
through some trainings or are some sort

628
00:28:17,679 --> 00:28:20,720
of themed activities

629
00:28:20,720 --> 00:28:24,720
um i believe the most important thing is

630
00:28:24,720 --> 00:28:25,760
to

631
00:28:25,760 --> 00:28:28,799
