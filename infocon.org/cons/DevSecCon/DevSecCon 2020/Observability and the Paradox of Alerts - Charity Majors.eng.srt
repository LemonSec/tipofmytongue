mango mouth dude from Staten Island New

21
00:01:11,729 --> 00:01:15,060
York and one of the hardest things

22
00:01:15,060 --> 00:01:17,700
sometimes for someone like me is to say

23
00:01:17,700 --> 00:01:20,790
things it did not sound like garbage

24
00:01:20,790 --> 00:01:24,479
because of just my accent me and so I

25
00:01:24,479 --> 00:01:28,439
try my hardest and so Maya was nice

26
00:01:28,439 --> 00:01:30,170
enough to send me a phonetic

27
00:01:30,170 --> 00:01:32,700
pronunciation of her name and I still

28
00:01:32,700 --> 00:01:36,780
screwed it up so Maya while you get your

29
00:01:36,780 --> 00:01:39,210

gonna do first while I sit here and vibe

34
00:01:50,850 --> 00:01:53,490
a little bit of Drake is remind you how

35
00:01:53,490 --> 00:01:56,250
if we had all these sponsors and what if

36
00:01:56,250 --> 00:01:58,350
these sponsors do they donated money to

37
00:01:58,350 --> 00:02:00,590
make sure that we can do this really

38
00:02:00,590 --> 00:02:03,040
super awesome event

39
00:02:03,040 --> 00:02:06,580
oh if you haven't given a dollar or two

40
00:02:06,580 --> 00:02:12,910
or more I really think you should and so

41
00:02:12,910 --> 00:02:16,000
like I mentioned earlier give it to your

42
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:19,480

44
00:02:22,960 --> 00:02:25,300
to do this really super dope talk why

45
00:02:25,300 --> 00:02:28,990
aren't you on all the talk stream and

46
00:02:28,990 --> 00:02:32,050
like I already bought you a ticket don't

47
00:02:32,050 --> 00:02:34,960
be a jerk just go on this at least

48
00:02:34,960 --> 00:02:36,280
that's how I would handle the situation

49
00:02:36,280 --> 00:02:39,040
oh but that's just me I'm a bit

50
00:02:39,040 --> 00:02:40,630
aggressive at times when it comes to

51
00:02:40,630 --> 00:02:46,630
raising money um anyhow we got a few

52
00:02:46,630 --> 00:02:50,590
more things going on tonight and I want

53
00:02:50,590 --> 00:02:52,750
to want to go through some of the

54
00:02:52,750 --> 00:02:55,959
schedule if that's cool with you all but

55
00:02:55,959 --> 00:02:58,930
once again thank you to our wonderful

56
00:02:58,930 --> 00:03:01,630
sponsors you are all beautiful wonderful

57
00:03:01,630 --> 00:03:04,770
lovely gorgeous people that gave money

58
00:03:04,770 --> 00:03:07,780
and in the end right now I think money

59
00:03:07,780 --> 00:03:10,090
is one of the most important things in

60
00:03:10,090 --> 00:03:12,340
this community that we can really give

61
00:03:12,340 --> 00:03:16,989
to what's been going on right right

62
00:03:16,989 --> 00:03:19,000
that's what I think so let's let's go

63
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:20,590
over the schedule let me bring it up for

64

00:03:45,130 --> 00:03:47,110
coming up it's called the threat is real

71
00:03:47,110 --> 00:03:49,540
soft clear supply chain vulnerabilities

72
00:03:49,540 --> 00:03:51,910
we're gonna have that here on the East

73
00:03:51,910 --> 00:03:55,650

98
00:05:06,190 --> 00:05:08,590
awesome thing yeah let's bring you part

99
00:05:08,590 --> 00:05:12,220
what are you I am in New York City where

100
00:05:12,220 --> 00:05:17,950
it's least oh it's it's so weird but you

101
00:05:17,950 --> 00:05:22,000
know I'm glad to be here and to be able

102
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:23,950
to do something like this with yourself

103
00:05:23,950 --> 00:05:28,240
I'm very very lucky that we are a part

104
00:05:28,240 --> 00:05:30,940
of kind of a community that um you know

105
00:05:30,940 --> 00:05:33,910
we got a lot to talk about and we we

106
00:05:33,910 --> 00:05:38,200
tend to talk a lot but if we can take

107
00:05:38,200 --> 00:05:40,090
all that talking and produce it into

108
00:05:40,090 --> 00:05:41,890
something that's beneficial to someone

109
00:05:41,890 --> 00:05:43,870
other than ourselves or the places with

110
00:05:43,870 --> 00:05:46,960
it we work for it then I think you know

111
00:05:46,960 --> 00:05:48,520
me and you being part of the big

112
00:05:48,520 --> 00:05:51,490
Microsoft umbrella we can feel a little

113
00:05:51,490 --> 00:05:55,540
bit better about ourselves so for you

114
00:05:55,540 --> 00:05:58,360
and the rest of my my Microsoft family I

115
00:05:58,360 --> 00:06:01,480
say thank you for being in a way whether

116
00:06:01,480 --> 00:06:02,920
it's get out of Microsoft or whatever

117
00:06:02,920 --> 00:06:04,720
we're doing we're all kind of been

118
00:06:04,720 --> 00:06:06,850

the country and and so thanks for giving

120
00:06:10,120 --> 00:06:14,860

you will the virtual room and we'll

125
00:06:26,169 --> 00:06:27,880
hopefully get some questions and we'll

126
00:06:27,880 --> 00:06:29,380
talk a little bit in a few minutes all

127

right so please

128
00:06:30,370 --> 00:06:38,590
uh enjoy okay great so it sounds like I

129
00:06:38,590 --> 00:06:40,900
will just get started so today we'll be

130
00:06:40,900 --> 00:06:42,370
talking about software supply chain

131
00:06:42,370 --> 00:06:45,250
vulnerabilities and they are real that's

132
00:06:45,250 --> 00:06:46,330
the whole point of this talk they are

133
00:06:46,330 --> 00:06:47,800
actually things that we have seen happen

134
00:06:47,800 --> 00:06:50,800
in the wild and that can exist so I'm

135
00:06:50,800 --> 00:06:53,380
Maya I'm a product manager at github I

136
00:06:53,380 --> 00:06:54,699
work on software supply chain security

137
00:06:54,699 --> 00:06:56,650
no wonder I'm talking with this topic

138
00:06:56,650 --> 00:06:57,370
right now

139
00:06:57,370 --> 00:06:58,810
something I find really interesting and

140
00:06:58,810 --> 00:07:01,510
really exciting and because it's a big

141
00:07:01,510 --> 00:07:03,160
real threat that we know we need to go

142
00:07:03,160 --> 00:07:05,949
solve in the industry so we'll be

143
00:07:05,949 --> 00:07:07,330
covering software supply chains

144
00:07:07,330 --> 00:07:08,889
vulnerabilities well first talk about

145
00:07:08,889 --> 00:07:11,740
what a software supply chain is if you

146
00:07:11,740 --> 00:07:12,760
haven't heard that term before

147
00:07:12,760 --> 00:07:15,310
unfamiliar with that term we'll dive

148
00:07:15,310 --> 00:07:17,530
right in and cover specific compromises

149
00:07:17,530 --> 00:07:19,210
that we've seen and we'll cover common

150
00:07:19,210 --> 00:07:21,070
kinds of attacks and when they're likely

151
00:07:21,070 --> 00:07:24,669
to happen and how and why these attacks

152
00:07:24,669 --> 00:07:26,260
are happening and we'll close up by

153
00:07:26,260 --> 00:07:28,300
discussing what as developers you can do

154
00:07:28,300 --> 00:07:30,130
today to avoid these kinds of situations

155
00:07:30,130 --> 00:07:34,960
so let's get started so the reality is

156
00:07:34,960 --> 00:07:37,150
today that it's extremely common to not

157
00:07:37,150 --> 00:07:39,160
actually really know what's running in

158
00:07:39,160 --> 00:07:40,630
your environment right as a developer a

159
00:07:40,630 --> 00:07:42,070
large amount of code that a typical

160
00:07:42,070 --> 00:07:44,200
organization uses is open source I've

161
00:07:44,200 --> 00:07:46,479
heard anything from 80% to no more than

162
00:07:46,479 --> 00:07:49,270
99% and you don't necessarily know what

163
00:07:49,270 --> 00:07:51,400
that actually includes so though you

164
00:07:51,400 --> 00:07:53,470
decide to pull in dependency a for your

165
00:07:53,470 --> 00:07:55,270
project it's possible but a has other

166
00:07:55,270 --> 00:07:57,400
dependencies B&C known as transitive

167
00:07:57,400 --> 00:07:59,110
dependencies and sometimes you even know

168
00:07:59,110 --> 00:08:00,130
that you have dependency at all

169
00:08:00,130 --> 00:08:01,720
so you're faced with a situation where

170
00:08:01,720 --> 00:08:02,590
you don't actually know what you're

171
00:08:02,590 --> 00:08:04,479
running in your environment and you just

172
00:08:04,479 --> 00:08:06,190
can't verify all of that code it's

173
00:08:06,190 --> 00:08:08,800
simply impossible today so what we've

174
00:08:08,800 --> 00:08:11,260
landed as an industry so far is that you

175
00:08:11,260 --> 00:08:12,340
need to be able to get some information

176
00:08:12,340 --> 00:08:15,310
and manage risk for the dependencies

177
00:08:15,310 --> 00:08:16,990
that you do have in your code and the

178
00:08:16,990 --> 00:08:18,250
potential vulnerabilities that these

179
00:08:18,250 --> 00:08:20,139
dependencies are introducing and that's

180
00:08:20,139 --> 00:08:21,370
where the concept of this software a

181
00:08:21,370 --> 00:08:22,870
supply chain comes into play just like

182
00:08:22,870 --> 00:08:24,370
you might have a hardware supply chain

183
00:08:24,370 --> 00:08:26,380
or a food supply chain understanding

184
00:08:26,380 --> 00:08:27,849
what ends up in that end product that

185
00:08:27,849 --> 00:08:30,849
you consume software dependencies are

186
00:08:30,849 --> 00:08:33,190
pervasive it's normal for your projects

187
00:08:33,190 --> 00:08:34,779
to use hundreds or even thousands of

188
00:08:34,779 --> 00:08:37,240
open-source dependencies if one of these

189
00:08:37,240 --> 00:08:40,089
dependencies has a vulnerability then

190
00:08:40,089 --> 00:08:41,380
chances are that you have a

191
00:08:41,380 --> 00:08:43,960
vulnerability as well being able to

192
00:08:43,960 --> 00:08:45,760
the work of thousands of open-source

193
00:08:45,760 --> 00:08:48,340
developers means also that thousands of

194
00:08:48,340 --> 00:08:50,560
strangers effectively have commit access

195
00:08:50,560 --> 00:08:52,690
to your production code so an innocent

196
00:08:52,690 --> 00:08:54,880
mistake or a malicious attack

197
00:08:54,880 --> 00:08:56,770
it's your supply chain will affect you

198
00:08:56,770 --> 00:09:01,000
deeply and so to kind of think about

199
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:02,800
what that really means a software supply

200
00:09:02,800 --> 00:09:04,330
chain is then anything that you depend

201
00:09:04,330 --> 00:09:06,010
on still a bigger product right for a

202
00:09:06,010 --> 00:09:07,000
pharmaceutical company

203
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:08,830
it's the provenance and the verification

204
00:09:08,830 --> 00:09:12,190
of ingredients that go into each drug to

205
00:09:12,190 --> 00:09:14,050
ensure high quality you know for a

206
00:09:14,050 --> 00:09:15,130
chocolate bar that you buy at the store

207
00:09:15,130 --> 00:09:16,960
it's the list of ingredients and some

208
00:09:16,960 --> 00:09:18,520
information on nutritional contents

209
00:09:18,520 --> 00:09:20,770
maybe organic ingredients and production

210
00:09:20,770 --> 00:09:21,820
facilities that you might have the

211
00:09:21,820 --> 00:09:23,350
package you know if it doesn't produce

212
00:09:23,350 --> 00:09:24,640
in a facility that doesn't you know

213
00:09:24,640 --> 00:09:25,990
process peanuts whatever it happens to

214
00:09:25,990 --> 00:09:28,960
be so then the software supply chain is

215
00:09:28,960 --> 00:09:30,760
everything that goes into your software

216
00:09:30,760 --> 00:09:33,250
and where it comes from who wrote it

217
00:09:33,250 --> 00:09:35,920
when it was contributed how it's been

218
00:09:35,920 --> 00:09:38,170
reviewed including reviews for security

219
00:09:38,170 --> 00:09:40,210
issues any known vulnerabilities

220
00:09:40,210 --> 00:09:42,310
supported versions license information

221
00:09:42,310 --> 00:09:44,440
about the flick a bowl just everything

222
00:09:44,440 --> 00:09:46,420
it's everything that you could could

223
00:09:46,420 --> 00:09:47,920
want to know about the software that

224
00:09:47,920 --> 00:09:49,090
you're running to help you determine

225
00:09:49,090 --> 00:09:51,610
your risk profile a software supply

226
00:09:51,610 --> 00:09:53,260
chain is anything that goes into or

227
00:09:53,260 --> 00:09:55,260
affects your code from development

228
00:09:55,260 --> 00:09:58,300
through your CI CD pipeline until it

229
00:09:58,300 --> 00:10:01,090
gets deployed into production now when

230
00:10:01,090 --> 00:10:03,010
you talk about dependencies as I as you

231
00:10:03,010 --> 00:10:04,960
know alluding to earlier it's what's

232
00:10:04,960 --> 00:10:06,220
scary isn't as much as what you're

233
00:10:06,220 --> 00:10:07,630
developing internally because hopefully

234
00:10:07,630 --> 00:10:09,670
you have some controls to say prevent

235
00:10:09,670 --> 00:10:10,990
developers from pushing code from their

236
00:10:10,990 --> 00:10:13,450
bathtub or maybe not during you know

237
00:10:13,450 --> 00:10:15,760
today's times or or you restricted who

238
00:10:15,760 --> 00:10:16,810
has super admin rights in your

239
00:10:16,810 --> 00:10:18,850
environment but what's scary with open

240
00:10:18,850 --> 00:10:21,580
source code is that you are allowing

241
00:10:21,580 --> 00:10:24,430
open source developers to the code that

242
00:10:24,430 --> 00:10:25,480
you're allowing your developers to fund

243
00:10:25,480 --> 00:10:28,870
from open source you don't know what's

244
00:10:28,870 --> 00:10:30,280
actually there right because open source

245
00:10:30,280 --> 00:10:31,870
is easy for developers it means it's

246
00:10:31,870 --> 00:10:34,300
also easy for attackers I don't want to

247
00:10:34,300 --> 00:10:35,890
scare you I want you to keep using open

248
00:10:35,890 --> 00:10:37,300
source code and contributing to it and

249
00:10:37,300 --> 00:10:39,100
and working on it I just want you to do

250
00:10:39,100 --> 00:10:40,540
it thoughtfully from a security point of

251
00:10:40,540 --> 00:10:42,610
view what's attractive from an attacker

252
00:10:42,610 --> 00:10:44,140
in a supply chain attack is that a

253
00:10:44,140 --> 00:10:45,850
single compromised vector can actually

254
00:10:45,850 --> 00:10:47,590
give them access to multiple targets

255
00:10:47,590 --> 00:10:50,110
so what developers are purposefully

256
00:10:50,110 --> 00:10:52,690
pulling into their code isn't you know

257
00:10:52,690 --> 00:10:54,610
actually in reality as as closely

258
00:10:54,610 --> 00:10:56,290
examined to say like network intrusions

259
00:10:56,290 --> 00:10:57,700
into your into your environment so

260
00:10:57,700 --> 00:11:00,190
it's a very attractive way of attacking

261
00:11:00,190 --> 00:11:04,090
your rear end okay so you might have

262
00:11:04,090 --> 00:11:06,100
heard security attacks broken down into

263
00:11:06,100 --> 00:11:07,720
kind of three components who the

264
00:11:07,720 --> 00:11:09,760
attacker is like a script kitty or a

265
00:11:09,760 --> 00:11:11,250
competitor or a nation-state

266
00:11:11,250 --> 00:11:15,580
how the attack is conducted and what the

267
00:11:15,580 --> 00:11:17,980
attack is attempting to do a supply

268
00:11:17,980 --> 00:11:20,050
chain attack in and of itself isn't

269
00:11:20,050 --> 00:11:21,880
usually the end goal right it's usually

270
00:11:21,880 --> 00:11:23,500
a step towards something else and

271
00:11:23,500 --> 00:11:26,020
unfortunately or fortunately almost

272
00:11:26,020 --> 00:11:28,000
anyone can conduct such an attack so

273
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:31,060
instead of focusing on the who will

274
00:11:31,060 --> 00:11:32,710
focus on the how which is of what

275
00:11:32,710 --> 00:11:34,570
happens to infiltrate or supply chain

276
00:11:34,570 --> 00:11:36,010
and the what what the attacker is

277
00:11:36,010 --> 00:11:38,530
actually trying to get up there are a

278
00:11:38,530 --> 00:11:39,730
couple of different methods to attack

279
00:11:39,730 --> 00:11:41,520
your supply chain the Hat the Hat

280
00:11:41,520 --> 00:11:43,720
inserting malicious code directly into

281
00:11:43,720 --> 00:11:45,580
dependency this could be a purposeful

282
00:11:45,580 --> 00:11:47,920
backdoor known malware or a known

283
00:11:47,920 --> 00:11:49,930
vulnerability or even introducing a new

284
00:11:49,930 --> 00:11:51,850
dependency this is like walking through

285
00:11:51,850 --> 00:11:54,780
the front door to introduce a back door

286
00:11:54,780 --> 00:11:57,040
compromising a build tool infrastructure

287
00:11:57,040 --> 00:11:58,480
to lure another piece of the CIC

288
00:11:58,480 --> 00:12:00,610
development pipeline which again could

289
00:12:00,610 --> 00:12:02,830
be yet another supply chain attack so a

290
00:12:02,830 --> 00:12:04,090
supply chain attack for supply chain

291
00:12:04,090 --> 00:12:06,270
attack it can get a bit meta

292
00:12:06,270 --> 00:12:08,290
compromising signing keys to make it

293
00:12:08,290 --> 00:12:10,120
seem like an unknown package came from a

294
00:12:10,120 --> 00:12:11,860
known trusted source right because who

295
00:12:11,860 --> 00:12:14,520
verifies those signatures anyways

296
00:12:14,520 --> 00:12:16,990
compromising a package manager or any

297
00:12:16,990 --> 00:12:20,320
kind of other distribution tool for for

298
00:12:20,320 --> 00:12:22,420
packages to affect several artifacts

299
00:12:22,420 --> 00:12:24,100
being distributed in the supply chain it

300
00:12:24,100 --> 00:12:25,570
could be a website used for software

301
00:12:25,570 --> 00:12:27,940
updates like an update server it could

302
00:12:27,940 --> 00:12:30,450
be anything

303
00:12:30,450 --> 00:12:32,980
compromised vulnerability reporting so

304
00:12:32,980 --> 00:12:34,630
this is basically man in the middling or

305
00:12:34,630 --> 00:12:36,190
man on the personing there's a person in

306
00:12:36,190 --> 00:12:37,750
the middle line getting myself confused

307
00:12:37,750 --> 00:12:40,020
like a security at reporting address

308
00:12:40,020 --> 00:12:42,340
getting into bug reports for example on

309
00:12:42,340 --> 00:12:45,550
a bug down a site or even getting on a

310
00:12:45,550 --> 00:12:47,200
fix or disclosure mailing list for a

311
00:12:47,200 --> 00:12:49,300
project that would allow a malicious

312
00:12:49,300 --> 00:12:50,470
actor to find out about a known

313
00:12:50,470 --> 00:12:51,850
vulnerability before it's widely

314
00:12:51,850 --> 00:12:54,280
announced and patched sometimes you've

315
00:12:54,280 --> 00:12:57,700
heard of this term called a bug door the

316
00:12:57,700 --> 00:13:00,100
idea is you know about a bug and you can

317
00:13:00,100 --> 00:13:01,720
use as a backdoor and then you just

318
00:13:01,720 --> 00:13:02,920
choose not to fix it so you can keep

319
00:13:02,920 --> 00:13:04,900
using it as at the bug door into into an

320
00:13:04,900 --> 00:13:07,750
environment account takeover of a

321
00:13:07,750 --> 00:13:09,730
maintainer so this could be the fake

322
00:13:09,730 --> 00:13:10,840
commits and

323
00:13:10,840 --> 00:13:12,520
how signing keys are managed this might

324
00:13:12,520 --> 00:13:14,050
be you know one in the same attack if

325
00:13:14,050 --> 00:13:15,130
they can get access to those keys as

326
00:13:15,130 --> 00:13:17,770
well in addition to compromising what a

327
00:13:17,770 --> 00:13:19,540
maintainer can publish without even

328
00:13:19,540 --> 00:13:21,040
going that far this could also include

329
00:13:21,040 --> 00:13:22,600
something like compromising a Mariners

330
00:13:22,600 --> 00:13:23,920
email again to get something like the

331
00:13:23,920 --> 00:13:27,070
security at bug reports a project

332
00:13:27,070 --> 00:13:28,510
takeover especially of an abandoned

333
00:13:28,510 --> 00:13:31,720
project accidental attacks like typos

334
00:13:31,720 --> 00:13:33,280
squatting to get users to accidentally

335
00:13:33,280 --> 00:13:34,720
pull in your project as a dependency

336
00:13:34,720 --> 00:13:36,480
when they miss type something and

337
00:13:36,480 --> 00:13:38,860
deletion just getting rid of whatever

338
00:13:38,860 --> 00:13:40,570
that dependency or that or that piece of

339
00:13:40,570 --> 00:13:43,120
code was in these have a few different

340
00:13:43,120 --> 00:13:44,800
aims or goals you know spoiler alert as

341
00:13:44,800 --> 00:13:46,750
like other attacks and security the

342
00:13:46,750 --> 00:13:48,070
ultimate motivation is almost always

343
00:13:48,070 --> 00:13:50,590
money so introducing a backdoor into

344
00:13:50,590 --> 00:13:52,180
your environment it's gonna be targeted

345
00:13:52,180 --> 00:13:53,320
for you because of only a particular

346
00:13:53,320 --> 00:13:55,480
piece of software or operating system or

347
00:13:55,480 --> 00:13:57,970
region or it might just be a wide swath

348
00:13:57,970 --> 00:13:59,340
to see what they can get access to

349
00:13:59,340 --> 00:14:01,510
introducing malware for example to cut

350
00:14:01,510 --> 00:14:04,120
select login information but really the

351
00:14:04,120 --> 00:14:06,400
easiest way to make malware to to make

352
00:14:06,400 --> 00:14:08,230
money these days is from currency mining

353
00:14:08,230 --> 00:14:11,080
so abusing any extra compute to mine the

354
00:14:11,080 --> 00:14:13,210
trinny currency of the day or setting up

355
00:14:13,210 --> 00:14:14,890
a botnet also falls in this in this in

356
00:14:14,890 --> 00:14:17,230
this spot and lastly service disruption

357
00:14:17,230 --> 00:14:18,460
right this could be for example taking a

358
00:14:18,460 --> 00:14:20,680
service offline so let's get into some

359
00:14:20,680 --> 00:14:21,760
of the examples because this is the part

360
00:14:21,760 --> 00:14:23,260
that I find really really fascinating

361
00:14:23,260 --> 00:14:25,750
here so first let's look at event stream

362
00:14:25,750 --> 00:14:27,580
this is probably the one that if you've

363
00:14:27,580 --> 00:14:28,930
heard of us a punching attack you

364
00:14:28,930 --> 00:14:31,270
probably heard of event stream it's a

365
00:14:31,270 --> 00:14:32,830
widely used node.js library available

366
00:14:32,830 --> 00:14:35,020
via NPM and when I say widely use I'm

367
00:14:35,020 --> 00:14:36,730
talking you know two million plus weekly

368
00:14:36,730 --> 00:14:39,760
downloads so what happened in the fall

369
00:14:39,760 --> 00:14:42,520
of 2018 a user right in nine control

370
00:14:42,520 --> 00:14:43,990
volunteer to take over event stream on

371
00:14:43,990 --> 00:14:46,240
github against a wily use package but

372
00:14:46,240 --> 00:14:48,010
not super low supporting so the author

373
00:14:48,010 --> 00:14:49,570
welcomed the extra help and even gave

374
00:14:49,570 --> 00:14:52,150
the newcomer publishing rights I want to

375
00:14:52,150 --> 00:14:53,410
emphasize that the author is not to

376
00:14:53,410 --> 00:14:54,700
blame here because we should have better

377
00:14:54,700 --> 00:14:56,140
ways to support these developers and

378
00:14:56,140 --> 00:14:59,320
also verify trust of our ecosystem the

379
00:14:59,320 --> 00:15:00,910
the author literally wrote in a github

380
00:15:00,910 --> 00:15:02,650
issue he emailed me and he said he

381
00:15:02,650 --> 00:15:04,210
wanted to maintain a module so I gave it

382
00:15:04,210 --> 00:15:05,860
to him I don't get anything from

383
00:15:05,860 --> 00:15:07,360
maintaining this module and I don't even

384
00:15:07,360 --> 00:15:09,760
use it anymore and have you for years so

385
00:15:09,760 --> 00:15:12,790
very much in the unsupported category on

386
00:15:12,790 --> 00:15:15,880
September 9th right nine control added a

387
00:15:15,880 --> 00:15:17,650
new dependency to event stream flatmap

388
00:15:17,650 --> 00:15:19,330
stream and then a week later on

389
00:15:19,330 --> 00:15:21,370
september 16th they rewrote the code to

390
00:15:21,370 --> 00:15:22,840
no longer require that dependency and

391
00:15:22,840 --> 00:15:24,570
try to remove it that change

392
00:15:24,570 --> 00:15:26,310
made in the codebase but wasn't actually

393
00:15:26,310 --> 00:15:27,420
pushed through where the library is

394
00:15:27,420 --> 00:15:30,000
being hosted on NPM and then on October

395
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:32,190
5th another user huge glass added

396
00:15:32,190 --> 00:15:35,010
malware to flatmap stream so then anyone

397
00:15:35,010 --> 00:15:36,360
who would have used event stream and

398
00:15:36,360 --> 00:15:37,710
pulled in the latest version of flatmap

399
00:15:37,710 --> 00:15:40,650
stream would receive that malware this

400
00:15:40,650 --> 00:15:42,330
was discovered in late November 2018

401
00:15:42,330 --> 00:15:44,370
meaning the dependency and malware were

402
00:15:44,370 --> 00:15:45,840
running for almost two months before it

403
00:15:45,840 --> 00:15:48,150
was discovered now fortunately this

404
00:15:48,150 --> 00:15:50,790
wasn't actually that bad um it was bad

405
00:15:50,790 --> 00:15:52,800
at that we didn't find it sooner but it

406
00:15:52,800 --> 00:15:54,540
was extremely targeted the malware

407
00:15:54,540 --> 00:15:56,160
looked to see if the host was a

408
00:15:56,160 --> 00:15:57,930
developer for a particular kind of

409
00:15:57,930 --> 00:15:59,700
cryptocurrency wallet the - co-pay

410
00:15:59,700 --> 00:16:02,130
wallet and if the host was a developer

411
00:16:02,130 --> 00:16:03,450
for that that piece of software it

412
00:16:03,450 --> 00:16:05,160
inserted an additional code to be

413
00:16:05,160 --> 00:16:08,310
distributed into the - co-pay wallet the

414
00:16:08,310 --> 00:16:10,110
code would scan user deposits to see if

415
00:16:10,110 --> 00:16:11,190
they're a Bitcoin or Bitcoin cash

416
00:16:11,190 --> 00:16:12,810
deposits for over a certain amount and

417
00:16:12,810 --> 00:16:15,150
if so capture passwords and sent those

418
00:16:15,150 --> 00:16:17,850
to remote address the malware did in

419
00:16:17,850 --> 00:16:19,650
fact make it into a handful of releases

420
00:16:19,650 --> 00:16:20,820
of - codebase so they it was a

421
00:16:20,820 --> 00:16:23,520
successful insertion into the supply

422
00:16:23,520 --> 00:16:25,020
chain there's no information that I

423
00:16:25,020 --> 00:16:26,280
could find as to whether or not they

424
00:16:26,280 --> 00:16:27,630
were actually able to get me the coin

425
00:16:27,630 --> 00:16:32,430
from this attack next up es lint I love

426
00:16:32,430 --> 00:16:34,230
this example as it's a again a software

427
00:16:34,230 --> 00:16:36,570
supply chain attack to try to make more

428
00:16:36,570 --> 00:16:38,130
software supply chain attacks happen so

429
00:16:38,130 --> 00:16:39,480
a meta a meta software supply chain

430
00:16:39,480 --> 00:16:42,950
attack in the morning of July 12 2018

431
00:16:42,950 --> 00:16:45,390
new versions of - the components of es

432
00:16:45,390 --> 00:16:47,820
lint were published on p.m. within an

433
00:16:47,820 --> 00:16:49,920
hour of publication a user filed a bug

434
00:16:49,920 --> 00:16:51,330
against a project and the malicious

435
00:16:51,330 --> 00:16:54,510
packages were unpublished Alto Alto

436
00:16:54,510 --> 00:16:57,060
those packages were up for less than

437
00:16:57,060 --> 00:17:00,660
four hours and and a few hours later

438
00:17:00,660 --> 00:17:02,430
fully remediated with new uncompromised

439
00:17:02,430 --> 00:17:04,380
versions being published so what

440
00:17:04,380 --> 00:17:06,300
actually happened in that you know four

441
00:17:06,300 --> 00:17:07,740
hour time frame went when those packages

442
00:17:07,740 --> 00:17:09,569
were upper we know how did this how did

443
00:17:09,569 --> 00:17:11,220
the delicious packages get published

444
00:17:11,220 --> 00:17:14,010
well the maintainer of es lint reuse

445
00:17:14,010 --> 00:17:16,079
their password elsewhere and didn't have

446
00:17:16,079 --> 00:17:18,180
to if they enabled so attackers used

447
00:17:18,180 --> 00:17:19,800
credential stuffing to generate off

448
00:17:19,800 --> 00:17:21,089
tokens for their account and start

449
00:17:21,089 --> 00:17:23,520
publishing new packages the malicious

450
00:17:23,520 --> 00:17:25,079
versions of es lint would try to connect

451
00:17:25,079 --> 00:17:27,990
to and download an execute code found on

452
00:17:27,990 --> 00:17:30,870
paste bin that captured the npm RFC file

453
00:17:30,870 --> 00:17:33,210
which is typically where npm auth tokens

454
00:17:33,210 --> 00:17:35,460
for publishing packages are stored so

455
00:17:35,460 --> 00:17:36,870
the goal here in polishing in

456
00:17:36,870 --> 00:17:38,460
compromising one and

457
00:17:38,460 --> 00:17:39,600
packages that they were hoping to get

458
00:17:39,600 --> 00:17:43,200
credentials for lots more NPM packages

459
00:17:43,200 --> 00:17:44,450
that they could use and go compromise

460
00:17:44,450 --> 00:17:46,740
since is malware was trying to capture

461
00:17:46,740 --> 00:17:48,990
and Kim credentials the response this

462
00:17:48,990 --> 00:17:50,730
issue had to be wider than just a single

463
00:17:50,730 --> 00:17:52,770
package right and in fact NPM took

464
00:17:52,770 --> 00:17:55,260
action to revoke all the access tokens

465
00:17:55,260 --> 00:17:57,780
generated before the incident that

466
00:17:57,780 --> 00:17:59,250
includes private packages if you think

467
00:17:59,250 --> 00:18:00,540
of the impact of that that's huge

468
00:18:00,540 --> 00:18:03,120
that's a lot of potential users affected

469
00:18:03,120 --> 00:18:05,040
by the cleanup of a single incident even

470
00:18:05,040 --> 00:18:07,230
though the the post-mortem determined

471
00:18:07,230 --> 00:18:08,970
that only a very small number of

472
00:18:08,970 --> 00:18:12,180
packages and users were affected so as

473
00:18:12,180 --> 00:18:13,380
much as I want you to also you know

474
00:18:13,380 --> 00:18:15,390
automate and automatically update all

475
00:18:15,390 --> 00:18:16,620
your dependencies this is a great

476
00:18:16,620 --> 00:18:17,610
example of where this would actually

477
00:18:17,610 --> 00:18:19,830
have been bad so for the downstream

478
00:18:19,830 --> 00:18:21,480
packages you should make it as easy as

479
00:18:21,480 --> 00:18:23,760
possible to upgrade but ideally a human

480
00:18:23,760 --> 00:18:24,930
is still in the loop especially if

481
00:18:24,930 --> 00:18:27,060
you're publishing a new version using a

482
00:18:27,060 --> 00:18:29,070
log file is another great way of forcing

483
00:18:29,070 --> 00:18:30,840
the explicit acknowledgment of any new

484
00:18:30,840 --> 00:18:32,220
versions of a dependency that you're

485
00:18:32,220 --> 00:18:34,400
using

486
00:18:34,670 --> 00:18:37,680
next up Kingslayer no I'm not talking

487
00:18:37,680 --> 00:18:39,330
about Jaime Lannister this is an

488
00:18:39,330 --> 00:18:41,490
interesting one this supply chain attack

489
00:18:41,490 --> 00:18:43,860
dubbed Kingslayer was presented on at

490
00:18:43,860 --> 00:18:46,830
RSA without initially disclosing which

491
00:18:46,830 --> 00:18:49,110
software had been attacked Brian Krebs

492
00:18:49,110 --> 00:18:51,000
then wrote a piece shortly afterwards to

493
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:52,650
draw attention to the fact there wasn't

494
00:18:52,650 --> 00:18:54,750
a sufficient disclosure identifying the

495
00:18:54,750 --> 00:18:56,700
software as easy log help which is

496
00:18:56,700 --> 00:18:59,850
produced by altair technologies this is

497
00:18:59,850 --> 00:19:01,710
also one of the OG supply chain attacks

498
00:19:01,710 --> 00:19:04,800
right this happened way back in March on

499
00:19:04,800 --> 00:19:08,730
2015 on March 31st 2015 a website used

500
00:19:08,730 --> 00:19:10,560
for distributing the windows log minute

501
00:19:10,560 --> 00:19:14,070
and software eb log was compromised with

502
00:19:14,070 --> 00:19:16,380
attackers publishing new signed software

503
00:19:16,380 --> 00:19:18,510
with the Kingslayer backdoor in that

504
00:19:18,510 --> 00:19:21,210
software a few days later on April 9 so

505
00:19:21,210 --> 00:19:22,470
it's literally ten days later the

506
00:19:22,470 --> 00:19:24,120
attackers also compromised the updated

507
00:19:24,120 --> 00:19:25,680
website so that versions that were

508
00:19:25,680 --> 00:19:26,970
automating that we're updating

509
00:19:26,970 --> 00:19:28,920
themselves automatically would also

510
00:19:28,920 --> 00:19:31,050
update and pull in the they compromised

511
00:19:31,050 --> 00:19:33,600
software version this is suspected of

512
00:19:33,600 --> 00:19:35,670
being an attack connected by an apt I

513
00:19:35,670 --> 00:19:38,040
couldn't easily find details on what the

514
00:19:38,040 --> 00:19:40,110
King Slayer malware did but it seems

515
00:19:40,110 --> 00:19:41,430
like it was meant to seal some sort of

516
00:19:41,430 --> 00:19:45,270
credentials so although the the vendor

517
00:19:45,270 --> 00:19:47,550
actually found the issue and fixed it on

518
00:19:47,550 --> 00:19:50,340
April 26 of 2015 so again all of this

519
00:19:50,340 --> 00:19:51,840
taking place within within a month and

520
00:19:51,840 --> 00:19:52,120
being

521
00:19:52,120 --> 00:19:54,250
within a month with a republish version

522
00:19:54,250 --> 00:19:56,200
they didn't do a very good job here in

523
00:19:56,200 --> 00:19:57,430
terms of incident response and

524
00:19:57,430 --> 00:20:00,100
communications so a defense contractor

525
00:20:00,100 --> 00:20:02,290
kept running the backdoored software

526
00:20:02,290 --> 00:20:03,820
until it was discovered in August of

527
00:20:03,820 --> 00:20:06,270
2016 so that's more than a year later

528
00:20:06,270 --> 00:20:08,980
before they've been ahead and found and

529
00:20:08,980 --> 00:20:10,480
identified other parties that were also

530
00:20:10,480 --> 00:20:12,430
at risk and wouldn't help them

531
00:20:12,430 --> 00:20:15,540
remediating according to the talk at RSA

532
00:20:15,540 --> 00:20:18,130
based on which ideas were contacting the

533
00:20:18,130 --> 00:20:20,650
update server the victims could have

534
00:20:20,650 --> 00:20:22,270
included so not confirmed could have

535
00:20:22,270 --> 00:20:24,520
included five defense contractors for

536
00:20:24,520 --> 00:20:26,590
telcos more than ten military

537
00:20:26,590 --> 00:20:29,740
organizations 24 banks or other

538
00:20:29,740 --> 00:20:31,390
financial institutions and a handful of

539
00:20:31,390 --> 00:20:33,310
other fortune 500 companies so a huge

540
00:20:33,310 --> 00:20:36,280
potential attack for some of these these

541
00:20:36,280 --> 00:20:38,020
large conglomerates large large

542
00:20:38,020 --> 00:20:42,030
organizations all right next up webmin

543
00:20:42,030 --> 00:20:44,380
webmin is a web app for managing unit

544
00:20:44,380 --> 00:20:46,210
servers like those running Linux or open

545
00:20:46,210 --> 00:20:50,530
BSD in August of 2019 it was revealed by

546
00:20:50,530 --> 00:20:52,120
a researcher at DEFCON that women had

547
00:20:52,120 --> 00:20:54,190
had a back door allowing for an

548
00:20:54,190 --> 00:20:57,820
authenticated remote code execution this

549
00:20:57,820 --> 00:21:00,970
allowed in some earlier versions any on

550
00:21:00,970 --> 00:21:02,410
ethic hitted access and in later

551
00:21:02,410 --> 00:21:04,690
versions only on earth I came to access

552
00:21:04,690 --> 00:21:06,220
if the Installer had changed the

553
00:21:06,220 --> 00:21:08,410
authentication to allow for users with

554
00:21:08,410 --> 00:21:10,000
expired passwords to then reset their

555
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:11,590
password so it was a flag that they need

556
00:21:11,590 --> 00:21:15,730
to to enable the attackers actually

557
00:21:15,730 --> 00:21:18,880
enabled that flag by default this was

558
00:21:18,880 --> 00:21:21,130
disclosed as a researcher as a zero-day

559
00:21:21,130 --> 00:21:22,960
without previously notifying the project

560
00:21:22,960 --> 00:21:25,780
of the vulnerability the backdoor was

561
00:21:25,780 --> 00:21:27,330
inserted as part of the build process

562
00:21:27,330 --> 00:21:29,950
interestingly the attackers only

563
00:21:29,950 --> 00:21:31,300
compromised some of the distribution

564
00:21:31,300 --> 00:21:33,790
with valid women and user min code on

565
00:21:33,790 --> 00:21:36,040
github but backdoor packages only on

566
00:21:36,040 --> 00:21:38,800
SourceForge so it's not clear to me

567
00:21:38,800 --> 00:21:40,360
exactly what part of the bill process is

568
00:21:40,360 --> 00:21:41,440
compromised and the maintainer has

569
00:21:41,440 --> 00:21:42,640
didn't clarify how this could have

570
00:21:42,640 --> 00:21:45,400
happened this remained from multiple

571
00:21:45,400 --> 00:21:46,960
versions of webmin with backdoor adverse

572
00:21:46,960 --> 00:21:48,780
ones being distributed for over a year

573
00:21:48,780 --> 00:21:51,340
likely the build servers were first

574
00:21:51,340 --> 00:21:54,220
compromised in April 2018 what's really

575
00:21:54,220 --> 00:21:55,600
sad here is that the maintainer has even

576
00:21:55,600 --> 00:21:57,550
moved to a new building for structure in

577
00:21:57,550 --> 00:22:00,430
September of 2018 and just copied over

578
00:22:00,430 --> 00:22:02,140
the backups that had the backdoor on it

579
00:22:02,140 --> 00:22:04,660
so instead of rebuilding from source

580
00:22:04,660 --> 00:22:06,040
which is a great practice

581
00:22:06,040 --> 00:22:08,170
to try here please don't copy over your

582
00:22:08,170 --> 00:22:09,690
malware and keep distributing it

583
00:22:09,690 --> 00:22:11,590
thankfully they were able to fix the

584
00:22:11,590 --> 00:22:13,300
issue by in fact to the building from

585
00:22:13,300 --> 00:22:16,960
source and that is that is a lesson here

586
00:22:16,960 --> 00:22:18,160
building from check didn't source code

587
00:22:18,160 --> 00:22:20,050
on github not a local directory that

588
00:22:20,050 --> 00:22:24,490
you're using another great example here

589
00:22:24,490 --> 00:22:26,110
docker one two three three two one

590
00:22:26,110 --> 00:22:29,260
in May of 2018 several malicious images

591
00:22:29,260 --> 00:22:31,120
were discovered on docker hub Chrome

592
00:22:31,120 --> 00:22:32,710
Tech which is the resource company that

593
00:22:32,710 --> 00:22:35,020
found this found 17 images with play

594
00:22:35,020 --> 00:22:37,480
names like docker 133 2-1 and those

595
00:22:37,480 --> 00:22:40,480
contain malware the darker one two three

596
00:22:40,480 --> 00:22:41,950
three two one registry was created in

597
00:22:41,950 --> 00:22:44,980
May of 2017 so year earlier and malware

598
00:22:44,980 --> 00:22:47,350
was added in the summer of 2017 the

599
00:22:47,350 --> 00:22:48,700
community was actually pretty good at

600
00:22:48,700 --> 00:22:50,770
discovering this and these identifying

601
00:22:50,770 --> 00:22:52,390
these issues with complaints made to

602
00:22:52,390 --> 00:22:55,210
docker hub in the fall of 2017 however

603
00:22:55,210 --> 00:22:56,380
nothing actually happened in these

604
00:22:56,380 --> 00:22:57,640
images stayed up publishing it

605
00:22:57,640 --> 00:22:59,440
publishing even new versions including

606
00:22:59,440 --> 00:23:03,670
the same malware Fortinet was able to

607
00:23:03,670 --> 00:23:05,080
link these images to a cryptocurrency

608
00:23:05,080 --> 00:23:08,080
mining botnet definitively in an early

609
00:23:08,080 --> 00:23:10,270
May of 2018 and then docker hub promptly

610
00:23:10,270 --> 00:23:12,400
removed the images nonetheless in that

611
00:23:12,400 --> 00:23:13,600
time period that one-year time period

612
00:23:13,600 --> 00:23:16,240
when this is online the 17 images in the

613
00:23:16,240 --> 00:23:17,620
registry were downloaded over five

614
00:23:17,620 --> 00:23:19,720
million times that matter that they

615
00:23:19,720 --> 00:23:21,310
contained was for mining cryptocurrency

616
00:23:21,310 --> 00:23:23,260
locally in this case Manero

617
00:23:23,260 --> 00:23:24,880
and then sending it to a remote server

618
00:23:24,880 --> 00:23:27,670
it's estimated that over ninety thousand

619
00:23:27,670 --> 00:23:29,440
US dollars worth of manera was mined by

620
00:23:29,440 --> 00:23:31,930
these images in that time period so I

621
00:23:31,930 --> 00:23:33,580
was a little bit surprised by that I was

622
00:23:33,580 --> 00:23:34,870
like 5 million downloads that's terrible

623
00:23:34,870 --> 00:23:35,980
and I was like oh ninety thousand

624
00:23:35,980 --> 00:23:37,210
dollars a minute that doesn't seem like

625
00:23:37,210 --> 00:23:40,270
that much um this was basically like a

626
00:23:40,270 --> 00:23:41,980
toy library like they were just

627
00:23:41,980 --> 00:23:43,990
depending on users testing random images

628
00:23:43,990 --> 00:23:46,510
and like messing around to see what they

629
00:23:46,510 --> 00:23:48,280
could do or accidentally downloading

630
00:23:48,280 --> 00:23:49,480
them so I think for you know an

631
00:23:49,480 --> 00:23:51,310
accidental download taking home a 90k

632
00:23:51,310 --> 00:23:54,670
paycheck is pretty good and then if

633
00:23:54,670 --> 00:23:55,900
anything this just gives attackers an

634
00:23:55,900 --> 00:23:57,190
idea of how quickly their malware could

635
00:23:57,190 --> 00:23:58,690
be detected and how it be handled this

636
00:23:58,690 --> 00:24:00,670
was a great test example if that was an

637
00:24:00,670 --> 00:24:02,230
attacker to see what I could get away

638
00:24:02,230 --> 00:24:03,660
with and over how much time

639
00:24:03,660 --> 00:24:08,650
and lastly left pad this is this main

640
00:24:08,650 --> 00:24:09,790
quit the headlines and you might not

641
00:24:09,790 --> 00:24:11,200
think of this as a supply chain attack

642
00:24:11,200 --> 00:24:12,820
and you've probably heard of it but I

643
00:24:12,820 --> 00:24:14,110
want to point out that it is still a

644
00:24:14,110 --> 00:24:17,050
service disruption so on me sorry on

645
00:24:17,050 --> 00:24:19,420
March 11th 2016 a developer who

646
00:24:19,420 --> 00:24:19,870
maintained

647
00:24:19,870 --> 00:24:22,420
small library called kik ki k on npm was

648
00:24:22,420 --> 00:24:23,950
approached by capcom which is the

649
00:24:23,950 --> 00:24:26,140
canadian messaging app to change the

650
00:24:26,140 --> 00:24:28,960
name of his package he refused and they

651
00:24:28,960 --> 00:24:30,010
didn't want to pay the amount that he

652
00:24:30,010 --> 00:24:33,400
proposed to take over that that name a

653
00:24:33,400 --> 00:24:35,500
week later on March 18th kicked Kampf

654
00:24:35,500 --> 00:24:37,540
lawyers went to NPM who agree that this

655
00:24:37,540 --> 00:24:39,010
could create confusion and handed the

656
00:24:39,010 --> 00:24:41,980
kik library name over to kake.com just a

657
00:24:41,980 --> 00:24:43,690
few days later on March 20th to the

658
00:24:43,690 --> 00:24:45,490
developer sent an angry email 10 p.m.

659
00:24:45,490 --> 00:24:47,980
about this decision he wrote I think I

660
00:24:47,980 --> 00:24:49,840
have the right of deleting all my stuff

661
00:24:49,840 --> 00:24:51,820
and that's exactly what he did

662
00:24:51,820 --> 00:24:54,790
removing 273 of his packages on March

663
00:24:54,790 --> 00:24:57,700
22nd millions of developers experienced

664
00:24:57,700 --> 00:24:59,890
exactly that when their packages would

665
00:24:59,890 --> 00:25:01,360
no longer run because they were missing

666
00:25:01,360 --> 00:25:03,760
a left pan library which most of them

667
00:25:03,760 --> 00:25:05,320
didn't even know they needed that the

668
00:25:05,320 --> 00:25:07,110
same developer had owned and deleted

669
00:25:07,110 --> 00:25:09,429
it's a tiny function that you could

670
00:25:09,429 --> 00:25:11,590
write yourself 11 lines of code to add

671
00:25:11,590 --> 00:25:12,850
characters at the beginning with string

672
00:25:12,850 --> 00:25:15,100
but so many other packages depend on

673
00:25:15,100 --> 00:25:16,300
that to be able to function

674
00:25:16,300 --> 00:25:18,580
two hours later NPM made the

675
00:25:18,580 --> 00:25:20,020
controversial decision to republish the

676
00:25:20,020 --> 00:25:22,720
deleted package this wasn't a malicious

677
00:25:22,720 --> 00:25:24,280
attacker like I said and so it's weird

678
00:25:24,280 --> 00:25:25,750
to think about about this as a supply

679
00:25:25,750 --> 00:25:28,450
chain attack but but I do the developer

680
00:25:28,450 --> 00:25:30,280
himself was mad I don't think he

681
00:25:30,280 --> 00:25:31,620
understood the impact this would have

682
00:25:31,620 --> 00:25:33,550
it's more about just showing how

683
00:25:33,550 --> 00:25:35,170
interconnected all of our software is

684
00:25:35,170 --> 00:25:37,330
and how few know that depends you that

685
00:25:37,330 --> 00:25:39,580
they truly depend on right like the

686
00:25:39,580 --> 00:25:40,660
developer didn't know it's gonna have

687
00:25:40,660 --> 00:25:42,700
the effect that it did users didn't know

688
00:25:42,700 --> 00:25:43,960
that they were using this package it

689
00:25:43,960 --> 00:25:45,940
caused major service disruption right

690
00:25:45,940 --> 00:25:47,140
that's still something that I would be

691
00:25:47,140 --> 00:25:48,250
worried about happening in my

692
00:25:48,250 --> 00:25:51,160
environment so looking at some of these

693
00:25:51,160 --> 00:25:53,670
together right I only picked six attacks

694
00:25:53,670 --> 00:25:56,050
this isn't a complete overview but more

695
00:25:56,050 --> 00:25:57,610
of a reminder in case you didn't realize

696
00:25:57,610 --> 00:25:58,870
like we've been seeing the attacks for a

697
00:25:58,870 --> 00:26:02,440
long time since at least 2015 supply

698
00:26:02,440 --> 00:26:04,120
chain attacks affect server software

699
00:26:04,120 --> 00:26:05,650
have been it have been occurring in in

700
00:26:05,650 --> 00:26:08,200
our name in our world and there's a lot

701
00:26:08,200 --> 00:26:09,340
more examples that I could have listed

702
00:26:09,340 --> 00:26:10,840
this is just six of the examples that I

703
00:26:10,840 --> 00:26:13,540
chose to focus on today so now that I've

704
00:26:13,540 --> 00:26:15,820
sufficiently scared you all and you know

705
00:26:15,820 --> 00:26:17,620
told the great story that I find very

706
00:26:17,620 --> 00:26:19,270
interesting what should we be doing

707
00:26:19,270 --> 00:26:22,059
right as much as we want to think that

708
00:26:22,059 --> 00:26:23,110
we're all gonna be dealing with the next

709
00:26:23,110 --> 00:26:25,090
super scary crazy supply chain

710
00:26:25,090 --> 00:26:25,809
compromised

711
00:26:25,809 --> 00:26:27,460
if you have a software supply chain

712
00:26:27,460 --> 00:26:29,520
security issue it's probably your fault

713
00:26:29,520 --> 00:26:31,270
did you forget to update your

714
00:26:31,270 --> 00:26:33,670
dependencies again this is about basic

715
00:26:33,670 --> 00:26:35,290
hygiene right reviewing and patching

716
00:26:35,290 --> 00:26:37,810
your dependencies boring super boring

717
00:26:37,810 --> 00:26:39,400
but that's it right

718
00:26:39,400 --> 00:26:41,140
white source found in the latest state

719
00:26:41,140 --> 00:26:42,910
of open source vulnerabilities report

720
00:26:42,910 --> 00:26:45,220
that 85% of open source vulnerabilities

721
00:26:45,220 --> 00:26:47,320
have a fix available like disclosure all

722
00:26:47,320 --> 00:26:50,230
you need to do is apply them and that's

723
00:26:50,230 --> 00:26:51,520
why this is boring advice that people

724
00:26:51,520 --> 00:26:52,510
don't want to follow it's like brushing

725
00:26:52,510 --> 00:26:53,950
your teeth and washing your hands for 20

726
00:26:53,950 --> 00:26:55,570
seconds right we all know that we should

727
00:26:55,570 --> 00:26:56,980
we should be doing this we should be

728
00:26:56,980 --> 00:26:58,810
falling the what our dentists and

729
00:26:58,810 --> 00:27:02,260
doctors tell us and our security teams

730
00:27:02,260 --> 00:27:03,970
tell us but it's still it's still hard

731
00:27:03,970 --> 00:27:04,690
to kind of wrap your head around

732
00:27:04,690 --> 00:27:08,710
sometimes so let's talk about we can do

733
00:27:08,710 --> 00:27:10,920
as a developer like I said boring advice

734
00:27:10,920 --> 00:27:13,120
but you know you should really be doing

735
00:27:13,120 --> 00:27:15,310
it first figure out what your

736
00:27:15,310 --> 00:27:17,260
dependencies are now that can be kind of

737
00:27:17,260 --> 00:27:19,000
hard if you're running on github there's

738
00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:20,530
a feature called it dependency graph

739
00:27:20,530 --> 00:27:22,330
lets you see these things if you're a

740
00:27:22,330 --> 00:27:23,830
developer of a package explicitly

741
00:27:23,830 --> 00:27:26,110
declare a dependencies consider using a

742
00:27:26,110 --> 00:27:29,110
lock file and keeping it updated next

743
00:27:29,110 --> 00:27:30,370
and this is the step that everyone's too

744
00:27:30,370 --> 00:27:32,710
lazy to do but remove your unnecessary

745
00:27:32,710 --> 00:27:34,750
dependencies right you don't have to

746
00:27:34,750 --> 00:27:35,950
patch something that you don't have

747
00:27:35,950 --> 00:27:39,490
that's like the like Zen Zen art of

748
00:27:39,490 --> 00:27:41,350
patching don't patch things that are not

749
00:27:41,350 --> 00:27:42,730
in your environment

750
00:27:42,730 --> 00:27:43,690
so for example if you're using

751
00:27:43,690 --> 00:27:45,400
containers use a scratch image or a

752
00:27:45,400 --> 00:27:46,630
minimal base image that's a great way of

753
00:27:46,630 --> 00:27:47,920
getting rid of things that you don't

754
00:27:47,920 --> 00:27:49,920
actually need in your environment

755
00:27:49,920 --> 00:27:53,350
automate security updates if you can

756
00:27:53,350 --> 00:27:55,120
automatically pull in security fixes for

757
00:27:55,120 --> 00:27:56,590
your code right I know and I know is

758
00:27:56,590 --> 00:27:58,420
that earlier in one of the examples

759
00:27:58,420 --> 00:28:00,220
there are some cases where you might not

760
00:28:00,220 --> 00:28:01,270
want to do that for example if you're

761
00:28:01,270 --> 00:28:02,710
automatically then publishing or not

762
00:28:02,710 --> 00:28:04,450
having a human review anything that goes

763
00:28:04,450 --> 00:28:07,180
on but this is so so so important and if

764
00:28:07,180 --> 00:28:08,500
you take one to do away from those talk

765
00:28:08,500 --> 00:28:10,900
it's do this if you're testing isn't

766
00:28:10,900 --> 00:28:12,550
good enough that you feel ok

767
00:28:12,550 --> 00:28:14,590
automatically pushing security updates

768
00:28:14,590 --> 00:28:16,390
then please click hos attention to

769
00:28:16,390 --> 00:28:19,960
security advisories a security advisory

770
00:28:19,960 --> 00:28:21,880
emails or alerts or Twitter or however

771
00:28:21,880 --> 00:28:22,900
you get your latest vulnerability

772
00:28:22,900 --> 00:28:25,240
information and know that you can patch

773
00:28:25,240 --> 00:28:27,580
right just because you're you're not

774
00:28:27,580 --> 00:28:29,320
passionate on a really regular basis you

775
00:28:29,320 --> 00:28:30,460
want to make sure that you're actually

776
00:28:30,460 --> 00:28:32,410
using a recent enough version that you

777
00:28:32,410 --> 00:28:34,000
can apply a patch like the patch will

778
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:35,680
come out for that version and then it's

779
00:28:35,680 --> 00:28:36,790
not disruptive to your environment to

780
00:28:36,790 --> 00:28:38,050
actually apply that patch because if you

781
00:28:38,050 --> 00:28:39,580
have to do something urgently you want

782
00:28:39,580 --> 00:28:41,500
to be able to do it testing on your

783
00:28:41,500 --> 00:28:45,670
patching and deployment pipeline great

784
00:28:45,670 --> 00:28:47,080
activity to do in

785
00:28:47,080 --> 00:28:49,269
great great thing you do spend a couple

786
00:28:49,269 --> 00:28:50,590
hours on and see if you can patch with

787
00:28:50,590 --> 00:28:53,860
it and lastly verify if and where you

788
00:28:53,860 --> 00:28:55,269
can what your dependencies are that

789
00:28:55,269 --> 00:28:56,620
you're using if you're part of a big

790
00:28:56,620 --> 00:28:58,960
company conduct your own audit publish

791
00:28:58,960 --> 00:29:00,490
the results in a way that's respectful

792
00:29:00,490 --> 00:29:02,890
to the maintainer run tools like NPM

793
00:29:02,890 --> 00:29:04,690
audit to verify your packages before you

794
00:29:04,690 --> 00:29:06,909
pull them scan your code and packages

795
00:29:06,909 --> 00:29:08,590
for new and vulnerabilities check the

796
00:29:08,590 --> 00:29:09,909
check sums of what you actually pulled

797
00:29:09,909 --> 00:29:11,080
to verify that that that's what you

798
00:29:11,080 --> 00:29:13,330
expected check the signatures like do do

799
00:29:13,330 --> 00:29:15,640
that check that you you would want to be

800
00:29:15,640 --> 00:29:17,289
able to do to have trust in your in your

801
00:29:17,289 --> 00:29:18,490
environment in your dependencies in your

802
00:29:18,490 --> 00:29:21,639
code so it's really boring advice remove

803
00:29:21,639 --> 00:29:22,330
what you don't need

804
00:29:22,330 --> 00:29:24,070
touch what you do and do it regularly

805
00:29:24,070 --> 00:29:28,750
patch patch patch and if you're using

806
00:29:28,750 --> 00:29:30,220
github there's a couple features here

807
00:29:30,220 --> 00:29:32,200
that you can use to address some of

808
00:29:32,200 --> 00:29:33,850
these things security alerts notify you

809
00:29:33,850 --> 00:29:35,950
of vulnerabilities in code dependencies

810
00:29:35,950 --> 00:29:38,200
that you have automated security updates

811
00:29:38,200 --> 00:29:40,149
generate a PR to actually move you to a

812
00:29:40,149 --> 00:29:42,549
fixed version those are generated

813
00:29:42,549 --> 00:29:44,380
automatically when a new vulnerable no

814
00:29:44,380 --> 00:29:46,809
sorry vulnerable dependency is found and

815
00:29:46,809 --> 00:29:48,940
these work for various environments

816
00:29:48,940 --> 00:29:50,289
including cert various ecosystems

817
00:29:50,289 --> 00:29:52,779
including composer maven and PM nougat

818
00:29:52,779 --> 00:29:55,149
hip and rubygems those features are on

819
00:29:55,149 --> 00:29:57,490
by default on public repos go turn it on

820
00:29:57,490 --> 00:30:00,789
for your private repos please and then

821
00:30:00,789 --> 00:30:03,340
lastly to learn more because I lost my

822
00:30:03,340 --> 00:30:08,740
screen to learn more there's a list here

823
00:30:08,740 --> 00:30:10,720
of someone so you can go check out one

824
00:30:10,720 --> 00:30:12,159
the first one there is a list of supply

825
00:30:12,159 --> 00:30:14,559
chain compromises published by the cloud

826
00:30:14,559 --> 00:30:16,960
native compute foundation and then I

827
00:30:16,960 --> 00:30:18,130
have some links to some features you

828
00:30:18,130 --> 00:30:20,639
should be enabling in your environment

829
00:30:20,639 --> 00:30:29,110
that's it hey sorry about that was

830
00:30:29,110 --> 00:30:31,779
trying to reshare on it my screen to

831
00:30:31,779 --> 00:30:33,880
come back in and made a little silly

832
00:30:33,880 --> 00:30:37,510
mistake so thank you so much I thought

833
00:30:37,510 --> 00:30:40,679
that was really interesting to listen to

834
00:30:40,679 --> 00:30:45,490
security remains so important to all

835
00:30:45,490 --> 00:30:49,590
this and and one of the things that I I

836
00:30:49,590 --> 00:30:54,070
really enjoy hearing were about the

837
00:30:54,070 --> 00:30:57,159
supply chain attacks specifically one of

838
00:30:57,159 --> 00:31:01,000
my favorite ones obviously is left bad

839
00:31:01,000 --> 00:31:03,850
and it's not really even a supply chain

840
00:31:03,850 --> 00:31:07,650
attack if you think about it it's simply

841
00:31:07,650 --> 00:31:12,930
almost in the same way that Seth from

842
00:31:12,930 --> 00:31:20,590
Google when he removed his chef I had

843
00:31:20,590 --> 00:31:22,570
issues with who was using his a package

844
00:31:22,570 --> 00:31:26,890
downstream he was like yeah right and

845
00:31:26,890 --> 00:31:28,210
change and change licensing and things

846
00:31:28,210 --> 00:31:30,850
like that like that's developers can do

847
00:31:30,850 --> 00:31:32,290
these things for various reasons right

848
00:31:32,290 --> 00:31:35,920
yeah I love Seth and I think one of the

849
00:31:35,920 --> 00:31:37,780
things that I got the most out of it is

850
00:31:37,780 --> 00:31:42,250
that sometimes you make decisions about

851
00:31:42,250 --> 00:31:45,450
the code that's used that you create and

852
00:31:45,450 --> 00:31:50,620
and and and it has repercussions and

853
00:31:50,620 --> 00:31:53,550
sometimes those repercussions are are to

854
00:31:53,550 --> 00:31:57,670
some benefit substance it's not quite as

855
00:31:57,670 --> 00:32:01,420
much and so that's something that um you

856
00:32:01,420 --> 00:32:04,330
know it's really interesting to learn

857
00:32:04,330 --> 00:32:08,650
about through how you you can't just

858
00:32:08,650 --> 00:32:12,880
always prepared for the obvious

859
00:32:12,880 --> 00:32:16,570
intrusion agreed and I think it's been

860
00:32:16,570 --> 00:32:17,830
really interesting I've been looking at

861
00:32:17,830 --> 00:32:19,750
a lot of different supply chain attacks

862
00:32:19,750 --> 00:32:21,400
focused on the server attacks I should

863
00:32:21,400 --> 00:32:23,770
say not there's also attacks to like put

864
00:32:23,770 --> 00:32:26,140
things in and you know Apple App Store

865
00:32:26,140 --> 00:32:30,220
app or like into you know some piece of

866
00:32:30,220 --> 00:32:32,830
remote software that you use to like you

867
00:32:32,830 --> 00:32:34,840
know anyways I'm looking at most on the

868
00:32:34,840 --> 00:32:37,320
server side and it's interesting to see

869
00:32:37,320 --> 00:32:41,530
how I mean one how often this is just

870
00:32:41,530 --> 00:32:42,910
caught by the community like the people

871
00:32:42,910 --> 00:32:43,990
who are finding this are people who are

872
00:32:43,990 --> 00:32:46,690
going huh that looks weird and we're

873
00:32:46,690 --> 00:32:48,250
really lucky when that happens within an

874
00:32:48,250 --> 00:32:50,200
hour or two hours or four hours of

875
00:32:50,200 --> 00:32:53,590
something weird happening right a lot of

876
00:32:53,590 --> 00:32:56,470
the time though it's people people

877
00:32:56,470 --> 00:32:58,570
aren't paying attention because you know

878
00:32:58,570 --> 00:33:00,880
everybody has too much going on so

879
00:33:00,880 --> 00:33:02,650
so it's good to see people step up and

880
00:33:02,650 --> 00:33:05,200
and and pay attention where they they

881
00:33:05,200 --> 00:33:06,730
can be paying attention but we can't

882
00:33:06,730 --> 00:33:08,950
expect that dab right we need people we

883
00:33:08,950 --> 00:33:10,210
need to be able to verify this stuff

884
00:33:10,210 --> 00:33:11,500
automate this stuff so that we don't

885
00:33:11,500 --> 00:33:13,630
have to rely on humans to be doing this

886
00:33:13,630 --> 00:33:14,640
work for

887
00:33:14,640 --> 00:33:18,880
that that's really a great point and I

888
00:33:18,880 --> 00:33:22,260
think that we don't sometimes think

889
00:33:22,260 --> 00:33:25,900
quite as deep when we start prepping we

890
00:33:25,900 --> 00:33:28,930
think you know a couple levels but we

891
00:33:28,930 --> 00:33:33,460
like yeah like how many OSI layers we

892
00:33:33,460 --> 00:33:36,610
have in the stack we sometimes have to

893
00:33:36,610 --> 00:33:39,040
think about all layers and when you

894
00:33:39,040 --> 00:33:40,870
think about security sometimes you have

895
00:33:40,870 --> 00:33:43,930
to peel it like like an onion to get

896
00:33:43,930 --> 00:33:45,340
through all the layers to make sure that

897
00:33:45,340 --> 00:33:48,190
you've really secured all aspects of not

898
00:33:48,190 --> 00:33:49,810
only your business but the applications

899
00:33:49,810 --> 00:33:54,370
that come along with it so hey Maya you

900
00:33:54,370 --> 00:33:57,430
want to help me close the section of the

901
00:33:57,430 --> 00:34:01,150
evening sorry I'm gonna put on

902

991
00:53:41,240 --> 00:53:44,150
happy to hear that charity is one of I

992
00:53:44,150 --> 00:53:48,320
think text o coolest speakers um and

993
00:53:48,320 --> 00:53:52,160
obviously we are super lucky to have

994
00:53:52,160 --> 00:53:55,400
charity part of a what's going on and

995
00:53:55,400 --> 00:53:59,180
ironic so I am sorry to all of our folks

996
00:53:59,180 --> 00:54:00,920
I had my drink already

997
00:54:00,920 --> 00:54:05,360
I won't be able to share it with you but

998
00:54:05,360 --> 00:54:10,270
I will put on a track I like this one

999
00:54:10,270 --> 00:54:18,410
it's a lovely song it is by jay-z saw

1000
00:54:18,410 --> 00:54:22,270
Psalm cry by jay-z

1001
00:54:22,270 --> 00:54:29,930
unplugged live so I think what we're

1002
00:54:29,930 --> 00:54:31,370
gonna do Mike

1003
00:54:31,370 --> 00:54:33,860
you know um charities run a little late

1004
00:54:33,860 --> 00:54:36,670
and that gives you an idle time to talk

1005
00:54:36,670 --> 00:54:39,500
about some of the things that have been

1006
00:54:39,500 --> 00:54:40,490
going on today

1007
00:54:40,490 --> 00:54:45,670
um obviously this has been an amazing

1008
00:54:45,670 --> 00:54:50,060
session uh I should say Conference of

1009
00:54:50,060 --> 00:54:54,290
talks there's so many of them and a lot

1010
00:54:54,290 --> 00:54:57,080
of really smart people have you seen

1011
00:54:57,080 --> 00:54:59,630
anything over the day the human like

1012
00:54:59,630 --> 00:55:03,890
thought was just kick ass oh man what I

1013
00:55:03,890 --> 00:55:08,020
thought was kick-ass was this guy called

1014
00:55:08,020 --> 00:55:13,490
Hannam um on the Java channel and he was

1015
00:55:13,490 --> 00:55:16,610
he was playing a guitar at the same time

1016
00:55:16,610 --> 00:55:20,740
all that oh my cell that implements a

1017
00:55:20,740 --> 00:55:23,810
whole like musical code like I remember

1018
00:55:23,810 --> 00:55:26,510
one of the things and you would go from

1019
00:55:26,510 --> 00:55:29,590
one to two it along break into it

1020
00:55:29,590 --> 00:55:32,360
do you remember this part so let me show

1021
00:55:32,360 --> 00:55:36,200
you this there was this and I guess that

1022
00:55:36,200 --> 00:55:37,970
it's it's cool that we can do this with

1023
00:55:37,970 --> 00:55:42,890
some music so hold on one sec so there

1024
00:55:42,890 --> 00:55:45,710
was a part where he said you either a

1025
00:55:45,710 --> 00:55:52,700
person that says this let's see it yeah

1026
00:55:52,700 --> 00:55:57,290
so when you hear this you only think of

1027
00:55:57,290 --> 00:55:59,630
one or two things and it determines who

1028
00:55:59,630 --> 00:56:14,320
you are so there's that or there is this

1029
00:56:15,910 --> 00:56:19,160
and I got a kick out of that part like

1030
00:56:19,160 --> 00:56:23,450
you said we hear that particular start

1031
00:56:23,450 --> 00:56:26,360
of the song you're one of two people did

1032
00:56:26,360 --> 00:56:28,760
see than you think under pressure or you

1033
00:56:28,760 --> 00:56:31,760
think I been on ice so I thought that

1034
00:56:31,760 --> 00:56:34,640
was really really cute it was a great

1035
00:56:34,640 --> 00:56:36,980
talk I was lucky enough to catch that

1036
00:56:36,980 --> 00:56:39,980
one but his ability just to just he

1037
00:56:39,980 --> 00:56:42,920
picked up a guitar just just 30 damn it

1038
00:56:42,920 --> 00:56:46,310
I mean it was amazing yeah it was it was

1039
00:56:46,310 --> 00:56:48,560

1094
01:00:19,030 --> 01:00:21,550
most incredibly brilliant people that we

1095
01:00:21,550 --> 01:00:24,610
have ever got to speak to in this few

1096
01:00:24,610 --> 01:00:28,140
seconds right now but it probably is

1097
01:00:28,140 --> 01:00:31,720
most incredible presenters and people in

1098
01:00:31,720 --> 01:00:33,610
this business that I've had an

1099
01:00:33,610 --> 01:00:35,770

1104
01:00:46,720 --> 01:00:48,460
side of the planet just want to make

1105
01:00:48,460 --> 01:00:50,560
sure that you're doing well as well as

1106
01:00:50,560 --> 01:00:55,480
doing well with tech we're still alive

1107
01:00:55,480 --> 01:00:59,800
you know going a little stir-crazy hate

1108
01:00:59,800 --> 01:01:04,900
the people we love the most the most you

1109
01:01:04,900 --> 01:01:07,510
know but like I can't complain I it's

1110
01:01:07,510 --> 01:01:11,860
it's it's um you know I was raised

1111
01:01:11,860 --> 01:01:13,330
fundamentalist I've been expecting this

1112
01:01:13,330 --> 01:01:14,830
to happen my entire life like I was

1113
01:01:14,830 --> 01:01:17,080
home-schooled so I sat in a house with

1114
01:01:17,080 --> 01:01:20,020
my family every day for like day in day

1115
01:01:20,020 --> 01:01:21,820
out and so this is kind of normal for me

1116
01:01:21,820 --> 01:01:24,820
and a really terrifying way and I've

1117
01:01:24,820 --> 01:01:26,560
been upend that mix nerd ever since I

1118
01:01:26,560 --> 01:01:29,170
like was in my early twenties so I've

1119
01:01:29,170 --> 01:01:31,060
just been like what's taking so long and

1120
01:01:31,060 --> 01:01:33,070
this doesn't seem very lethal so but my

1121
01:01:33,070 --> 01:01:34,240
thoughts are mostly not helpful to

1122
01:01:34,240 --> 01:01:38,069
people so I don't really talk about them

1123
01:01:38,550 --> 01:01:40,750
it seemed like every other year there's

1124
01:01:40,750 --> 01:01:43,720
something there was always something I

1125
01:01:43,720 --> 01:01:45,490
mean this one is more contagious than

1126
01:01:45,490 --> 01:01:47,770
most but way less deadly than your

1127
01:01:47,770 --> 01:01:50,860
average pandemic I think we just don't

1128
01:01:50,860 --> 01:01:53,440
find a way to keep ourselves safe

1129
01:01:53,440 --> 01:01:55,480
through being stuck inside

1130
01:01:55,480 --> 01:01:56,830
and I think that's what we're all trying

1131
01:01:56,830 --> 01:01:59,590
to carry on right humans humans are

1132
01:01:59,590 --> 01:02:02,650
incredibly adaptable if they just give

1133
01:02:02,650 --> 01:02:07,420

01:02:55,120 --> 01:03:08,860
wherever you are you to take care it's

1149
01:03:08,860 --> 01:03:10,930
the best way get me slides the show and

1150
01:03:10,930 --> 01:03:13,890
full screen of fun

1151
01:03:17,610 --> 01:03:28,480
Richard what we'll do it's I mean I can

1152
01:03:28,480 --> 01:03:29,950
I can I can just do it like this it just

1153
01:03:29,950 --> 01:03:32,890
looks really crappy that's fine let's

1154
01:03:32,890 --> 01:03:34,000
just go ahead and get going over he's

1155
01:03:34,000 --> 01:03:39,330
like half my time so okay let's see here

1156
01:03:39,330 --> 01:03:46,690
we go ahead ed you again there maybe you

1157
01:03:46,690 --> 01:03:52,300
can minimize that that thing that's yeah

1158
01:03:52,300 --> 01:03:55,710
I'm trying to I don't know how

1159
01:04:03,640 --> 01:04:10,730
about that that helped push let's just

1160
01:04:10,730 --> 01:04:13,369
get going I I don't know how I get any

1161
01:04:13,369 --> 01:04:15,440
better that's fine I slide that super

1162
01:04:15,440 --> 01:04:20,210
complicated well you want you want it

1163
01:04:20,210 --> 01:04:22,099
all I can do is hide this head the

1164
01:04:22,099 --> 01:04:24,530
screen and you could just you could just

1165
01:04:24,530 --> 01:04:25,820
start through it or you could just start

1166
01:04:25,820 --> 01:04:41,359
there no it's it's really fine yeah well

1167
01:04:41,359 --> 01:04:42,410
I'm ready to start whenever you guys are

1168
01:04:42,410 --> 01:04:50,510
go ahead go for it hi in my life yeah

1169
01:04:50,510 --> 01:04:53,480
your life oh sweet okay

1170
01:04:53,480 --> 01:04:58,490
welcome to the the show of charities

1171
01:04:58,490 --> 01:05:07,849
very confused by graphical technology in

1172
01:05:07,849 --> 01:05:10,579
the screens even work doesn't run i it's

1173
01:05:10,579 --> 01:05:16,660
pretty basic so see you Sarah Lee its

1174
01:05:16,660 --> 01:05:19,099
haha that's what we wanted

1175
01:05:19,099 --> 01:05:26,810
it's I'd wait hi welcome everybody to

1176
01:05:26,810 --> 01:05:31,460
the second half of the talk about

1177
01:05:31,460 --> 01:05:34,040
alerting this is the first time I've

1178
01:05:34,040 --> 01:05:36,859
given a talk about this but it is not

1179
01:05:36,859 --> 01:05:39,280
the first time that I am ranted about it

1180
01:05:39,280 --> 01:05:41,990
it's very strange to be talking out into

1181
01:05:41,990 --> 01:05:43,010
the void like this and getting

1182
01:05:43,010 --> 01:05:45,250
absolutely no response from anyone but

1183
01:05:45,250 --> 01:05:49,910
here we are so the paradox of alert is

1184
01:05:49,910 --> 01:05:54,290
that the more you add the less useful

1185
01:05:54,290 --> 01:05:59,390
they are after a certain boundary and so

1186
01:05:59,390 --> 01:06:01,700
that's what I'm going to talk about now

1187
01:06:01,700 --> 01:06:03,920
most of you if you're familiar with

1188
01:06:03,920 --> 01:06:06,800
alerts you've probably encountered some

1189
01:06:06,800 --> 01:06:10,690
best practices list or we written the

1190
01:06:10,690 --> 01:06:14,589
ball and play it looks something like

1191
01:06:14,589 --> 01:06:16,339
this okay

1192
01:06:16,339 --> 01:06:17,210
first I did have a slide about

1193
01:06:17,210 --> 01:06:20,719
introducing myself you can tell them

1194
01:06:20,719 --> 01:06:21,799
from ops this is my standard joke

1195
01:06:21,799 --> 01:06:24,259
because that's my quote about diffs the

1196
01:06:24,259 --> 01:06:27,170
only good dif is the red disc firmly

1197
01:06:27,170 --> 01:06:32,930
believe that um and this is part of what

1198
01:06:32,930 --> 01:06:36,140
I was just working on a target it's like

1199
01:06:36,140 --> 01:06:39,369
how to have high-performing teams and

1200
01:06:39,369 --> 01:06:43,160
here's the alerting best practices yeah

1201
01:06:43,160 --> 01:06:44,690
so do these something familiar probably

1202
01:06:44,690 --> 01:06:46,400
the most people plan and can figure out

1203
01:06:46,400 --> 01:06:49,339
your alerts set priorities on them every

1204
01:06:49,339 --> 01:06:51,049
alert must be actionable this is like

1205
01:06:51,049 --> 01:06:53,390
the golden rule right this is cardinal

1206
01:06:53,390 --> 01:06:55,519
rule of learning every alert let's be

1207
01:06:55,519 --> 01:06:59,599
actionable almost nobody every everyone

1208
01:06:59,599 --> 01:07:01,460
knows that they should right if

1209
01:07:01,460 --> 01:07:03,099
something is quiet something's wrong

1210
01:07:03,099 --> 01:07:06,589
right a runbook document a process for

1211
01:07:06,589 --> 01:07:08,479
every single alert oh this is just the

1212
01:07:08,479 --> 01:07:17,089
first half keep going level up build

1213
01:07:17,089 --> 01:07:20,180
dashboards monitor server house you

1214
01:07:20,180 --> 01:07:21,829
shouldn't have to watch your monitoring

1215
01:07:21,829 --> 01:07:23,569
system your system should just inform

1216
01:07:23,569 --> 01:07:24,769
you when something is wrong and you need

1217
01:07:24,769 --> 01:07:26,839
to go look at it you really only need to

1218
01:07:26,839 --> 01:07:27,890
look at your monitoring systems when

1219
01:07:27,890 --> 01:07:33,200
there is a problem raise your hand

1220
01:07:33,200 --> 01:07:36,589
well except I can't see you but here's

1221
01:07:36,589 --> 01:07:37,130
the reality

1222
01:07:37,130 --> 01:07:40,729
like monitoring's best practices are to

1223
01:07:40,729 --> 01:07:44,930
a surprising degree the nearer and

1224
01:07:44,930 --> 01:07:48,700
future anti-patterns

1225
01:07:49,599 --> 01:07:51,319
for those of you who aren't familiar

1226
01:07:51,319 --> 01:07:53,779
familiar with observability and how I

1227
01:07:53,779 --> 01:07:55,099
defined it I suppose I should back up

1228
01:07:55,099 --> 01:07:58,700
just a little bit I I think the best

1229
01:07:58,700 --> 01:08:00,680
that definition for observability is the

1230
01:08:00,680 --> 01:08:03,529
one that is you know derived descended

1231
01:08:03,529 --> 01:08:06,469
from our our cousins the mechanical

1232
01:08:06,469 --> 01:08:09,319
engineers control systems engineers who

1233
01:08:09,319 --> 01:08:10,849
for whom this is like an actual

1234
01:08:10,849 --> 01:08:12,950
mathematical thing like your your

1235
01:08:12,950 --> 01:08:14,809
observability is a mathematical dual of

1236
01:08:14,809 --> 01:08:20,810
your control ability and to the extent

1237
01:08:20,810 --> 01:08:22,759
that you can understand the internals of

1238
01:08:22,759 --> 01:08:24,649
your system just by looking at it from

1239
01:08:24,649 --> 01:08:26,899
the outside any state no matter what

1240
01:08:26,899 --> 01:08:29,540
it's doing can you analyze it the

1241
01:08:29,540 --> 01:08:30,109
outside

1242
01:08:30,109 --> 01:08:33,200
and I think this is incredibly powerful

1243
01:08:33,200 --> 01:08:37,490
you can say it is is it dovetails with

1244
01:08:37,490 --> 01:08:41,210
all of the hard interesting problems in

1245
01:08:41,210 --> 01:08:43,910
technology that are causing people so

1246
01:08:43,910 --> 01:08:45,290
much pain and suffering in ways that

1247
01:08:45,290 --> 01:08:47,149
aren't always immediately intuitively

1248
01:08:47,149 --> 01:08:50,240
obvious but it's kind of like the more

1249
01:08:50,240 --> 01:08:51,830
you start to pick up the thread and

1250
01:08:51,830 --> 01:08:53,990
understand it and notice implications in

1251
01:08:53,990 --> 01:08:56,540
your own daily work the more profound it

1252
01:08:56,540 --> 01:08:57,890
becomes which is why I get really pissed

1253
01:08:57,890 --> 01:08:59,089
off with people trying to water it down

1254
01:08:59,089 --> 01:09:02,029
to just like a couple of pillars in a

1255
01:09:02,029 --> 01:09:07,670
tabletop or whatever the it is but

1256
01:09:07,670 --> 01:09:08,630
the difference between monitoring

1257
01:09:08,630 --> 01:09:12,130
observability is that you know

1258
01:09:12,130 --> 01:09:15,740
monitoring has to be pretty post hoc you

1259
01:09:15,740 --> 01:09:17,359
know if I build my system I can probably

1260
01:09:17,359 --> 01:09:24,080
look at it size it up tree cover fire

1261
01:09:24,080 --> 01:09:25,819
right database is gonna route of

1262
01:09:25,819 --> 01:09:28,010
connection it's something to fill up

1263
01:09:28,010 --> 01:09:30,140
right on and on you can get some by

1264
01:09:30,140 --> 01:09:31,370
eighty percent of them and then over the

1265
01:09:31,370 --> 01:09:33,620
next over the first couple months of

1266
01:09:33,620 --> 01:09:36,439
running the system I will encounter the

1267
01:09:36,439 --> 01:09:40,460
rest face first and add fir been running

1268
01:09:40,460 --> 01:09:41,899
it for a few months I will have amassed

1269
01:09:41,899 --> 01:09:45,620
a big library of checks that fire off

1270
01:09:45,620 --> 01:09:46,850
and tell me things about how the system

1271
01:09:46,850 --> 01:09:53,960
is performing and so you like monitoring

1272
01:09:53,960 --> 01:09:55,820
is very much it's it's focused around

1273
01:09:55,820 --> 01:10:00,110
you know what have I seen before and

1274
01:10:00,110 --> 01:10:01,640
creating thresholds for good systems

1275
01:10:01,640 --> 01:10:04,100
that resemble those things which for a

1276
01:10:04,100 --> 01:10:06,680
long time was great it was all you

1277
01:10:06,680 --> 01:10:08,810
needed right like I mean how many times

1278
01:10:08,810 --> 01:10:11,810
a year would you really truly encounter

1279
01:10:11,810 --> 01:10:14,930
something brand new five years ago ten

1280
01:10:14,930 --> 01:10:17,450
years ago you know I happened like twice

1281
01:10:17,450 --> 01:10:19,160
a year you know we're just be like all

1282
01:10:19,160 --> 01:10:21,590
hands on deck we have no idea what's

1283
01:10:21,590 --> 01:10:28,340
going on and if you'll find out like the

1284
01:10:28,340 --> 01:10:30,980
way we quote debugged was by getting

1285
01:10:30,980 --> 01:10:34,850
alert looking at it applying like our

1286
01:10:34,850 --> 01:10:37,220
superhuman you know pattern matching

1287
01:10:37,220 --> 01:10:39,740
skills to the library of past outages

1288
01:10:39,740 --> 01:10:41,210
that we had encountered and going it

1289
01:10:41,210 --> 01:10:43,040
looks like that one boom and going and

1290
01:10:43,040 --> 01:10:43,770
testing

1291
01:10:43,770 --> 01:10:45,390
bah this is by looking for that symptom

1292
01:10:45,390 --> 01:10:47,940
right and if it wasn't that back to the

1293
01:10:47,940 --> 01:10:50,760
database looks like that would know and

1294
01:10:50,760 --> 01:10:52,470
I love this like I love being that

1295
01:10:52,470 --> 01:10:54,870
wizard I loved like walking into a room

1296
01:10:54,870 --> 01:10:57,330
look in the dashboards going it's read

1297
01:10:57,330 --> 01:10:59,130
as his fault you know what it said

1298
01:10:59,130 --> 01:11:00,540
nothing about right is there just like

1299
01:11:00,540 --> 01:11:03,540
pad Iraq it was super fun it was also

1300
01:11:03,540 --> 01:11:06,450
super bad for the team mm-hmm they

1301
01:11:06,450 --> 01:11:08,220
couldn't you know follow that intuitive

1302
01:11:08,220 --> 01:11:11,370
leap that was scar tissue speaking and

1303
01:11:11,370 --> 01:11:16,710
and observability gets us back to if

1304
01:11:16,710 --> 01:11:19,920
older and I think more dependable way of

1305
01:11:19,920 --> 01:11:23,310
working through problems which is you

1306
01:11:23,310 --> 01:11:25,110
start at the top or at the edge of some

1307
01:11:25,110 --> 01:11:30,900
place and you just steadily tick just

1308
01:11:30,900 --> 01:11:35,250
and yeah you know so like you know okay

1309
01:11:35,250 --> 01:11:37,620
example and I recognized this pen a lot

1310
01:11:37,620 --> 01:11:38,520
of time this but I think is actually

1311
01:11:38,520 --> 01:11:42,330
important example being you might go

1312
01:11:42,330 --> 01:11:44,430
let's write us jump to the untested is

1313
01:11:44,430 --> 01:11:46,380
it look at Redis is it up is it down is

1314
01:11:46,380 --> 01:11:47,990
it slow at high connections that are and

1315
01:11:47,990 --> 01:11:52,380
yep it was right as with observability I

1316
01:11:52,380 --> 01:11:54,150
might have started the edge and gone

1317
01:11:54,150 --> 01:11:56,850
there's a lot of errors where are they

1318
01:11:56,850 --> 01:12:00,510
coming from uh you know breakdown by end

1319
01:12:00,510 --> 01:12:03,330
point Oh seems because it seems to be

1320
01:12:03,330 --> 01:12:05,640
mostly these three end points these are

1321
01:12:05,640 --> 01:12:07,980
the push notification endpoints what do

1322
01:12:07,980 --> 01:12:09,690
they do or what do they talk to it is it

1323
01:12:09,690 --> 01:12:12,570
all of them yes it seems to be all of

1324
01:12:12,570 --> 01:12:14,640
them is evenly spread across all is it

1325
01:12:14,640 --> 01:12:17,040
all users yes it seems evenly spread all

1326
01:12:17,040 --> 01:12:21,120
users is it you know or maybe no it's

1327
01:12:21,120 --> 01:12:23,070
not all of them maybe um

1328
01:12:23,070 --> 01:12:25,230
it only taught it maybe it's only the

1329
01:12:25,230 --> 01:12:29,760
subset of users um well you know are

1330
01:12:29,760 --> 01:12:36,840
those things we just the set what did

1331
01:12:36,840 --> 01:12:38,160
they have in common you know maybe it's

1332
01:12:38,160 --> 01:12:41,130
all the ones in u.s. East a so it's all

1333
01:12:41,130 --> 01:12:42,660
the ones in u.s. East one a then is it

1334
01:12:42,660 --> 01:12:44,310
all of them no it's just the ones in

1335
01:12:44,310 --> 01:12:46,560
this instance type is it all of them yes

1336
01:12:46,560 --> 01:12:48,030
right and you brought your answer and

1337
01:12:48,030 --> 01:12:49,890
it's it's one step after the other and

1338
01:12:49,890 --> 01:12:52,140
they're know intuitively subpoenas but

1339
01:12:52,140 --> 01:12:54,150
you start knowing nothing and knowing

1340
01:12:54,150 --> 01:12:55,860
the answer and if this is more reliable

1341
01:12:55,860 --> 01:12:56,680
because

1342
01:12:56,680 --> 01:12:59,470
as you know often you know maybe I went

1343
01:12:59,470 --> 01:13:01,510
in a stret acidic jump straight to Redis

1344
01:13:01,510 --> 01:13:04,900
maybe it was Redis and something else or

1345
01:13:04,900 --> 01:13:07,600
maybe it's you know Redis was symptom of

1346
01:13:07,600 --> 01:13:10,000
yet another thing you know upstream from

1347
01:13:10,000 --> 01:13:14,260
it that was overflowing okay so my rings

1348
01:13:14,260 --> 01:13:16,450
my practices are observability see anti

1349
01:13:16,450 --> 01:13:25,050
patterns so let's start with actionable

1350
01:13:25,050 --> 01:13:27,990
yes my slides are fitting i will i

1351
01:13:27,990 --> 01:13:30,550
hereby commit to you i will write and

1352
01:13:30,550 --> 01:13:35,430
post a better set of slides tonight

1353
01:13:37,830 --> 01:13:42,460
monitoring inherently onin ones you have

1354
01:13:42,460 --> 01:13:44,860
to know that a problem is going to

1355
01:13:44,860 --> 01:13:46,780
happen before you monitor its you have

1356
01:13:46,780 --> 01:13:48,400
to be able to predict that this scenario

1357
01:13:48,400 --> 01:13:50,410
would have would be able to happen it in

1358
01:13:50,410 --> 01:13:52,750
order to monitor it as so and you can

1359
01:13:52,750 --> 01:13:54,460
see why like modern software was

1360
01:13:54,460 --> 01:13:56,290
generally sufficient for so long you

1361
01:13:56,290 --> 01:14:00,310
know but increasingly and the systems

1362
01:14:00,310 --> 01:14:01,800
that we run these days especially

1363
01:14:01,800 --> 01:14:04,630
microservices was within this curve

1364
01:14:04,630 --> 01:14:09,790
really you shouldn't be getting paged

1365
01:14:09,790 --> 01:14:12,040
about things that are commonplace and

1366
01:14:12,040 --> 01:14:13,330
know about and that you know about right

1367
01:14:13,330 --> 01:14:16,030
because like the only way to even keep

1368
01:14:16,030 --> 01:14:17,620
up with systems of this complexity that

1369
01:14:17,620 --> 01:14:19,510
have beat all these many different

1370
01:14:19,510 --> 01:14:22,420
things breaking all at once is by you

1371
01:14:22,420 --> 01:14:24,340
know applying a sorry best practices to

1372
01:14:24,340 --> 01:14:26,260
pay down that debt so that you don't get

1373
01:14:26,260 --> 01:14:27,790
paged about the ones you know about they

1374
01:14:27,790 --> 01:14:29,590
get remediated they get sent to a

1375
01:14:29,590 --> 01:14:31,990
different tier like you even have a cute

1376
01:14:31,990 --> 01:14:33,790
you can have a cute you have some other

1377
01:14:33,790 --> 01:14:36,670
form of notifications that are for not

1378
01:14:36,670 --> 01:14:39,010
waking up in milna right right

1379
01:14:39,010 --> 01:14:43,630
but like it's about you things that you

1380
01:14:43,630 --> 01:14:45,940
used to paid you and now you don't paid

1381
01:14:45,940 --> 01:14:49,800
you write with observability the goal is

1382
01:14:49,800 --> 01:14:52,600
it's very treatable is that you never

1383
01:14:52,600 --> 01:14:56,620
get paged about a thing that you

1384
01:14:56,620 --> 01:14:59,440
understand right every time it should be

1385
01:14:59,440 --> 01:15:03,760
like ah not like oh that again oh that

1386
01:15:03,760 --> 01:15:05,369
again

1387
01:15:05,369 --> 01:15:08,099
again look there it is those pages will

1388
01:15:08,099 --> 01:15:09,840
burn your team out they will make

1389
01:15:09,840 --> 01:15:11,670
everyone not want to be on call they're

1390
01:15:11,670 --> 01:15:13,770
incredibly costly to them around to

1391
01:15:13,770 --> 01:15:17,639
attention and you can't keep up with

1392
01:15:17,639 --> 01:15:19,170
them like you can't hire your way out of

1393
01:15:19,170 --> 01:15:22,110
this you can't get a tier one set of

1394
01:15:22,110 --> 01:15:25,949
folks to just like be your buffer you

1395
01:15:25,949 --> 01:15:30,599
actually have to fix things monitoring's

1396
01:15:30,599 --> 01:15:31,920
not known unknowns durability is about

1397
01:15:31,920 --> 01:15:37,050
the unknown unknowns and that means we

1398
01:15:37,050 --> 01:15:38,400
have to kind of radically shift toys

1399
01:15:38,400 --> 01:15:46,770
even alerts instead of you have Alert

1400
01:15:46,770 --> 01:15:48,270
only when you know your users are being

1401
01:15:48,270 --> 01:15:50,340
impacted when they are feeling a pain

1402
01:15:50,340 --> 01:15:53,310
like your operational pain should be so

1403
01:15:53,310 --> 01:15:54,960
closely aligned with your user pain it's

1404
01:15:54,960 --> 01:15:56,639
not even funny everybody always pipes up

1405
01:15:56,639 --> 01:15:59,010
yeah but actually I want to get paid for

1406
01:15:59,010 --> 01:16:00,989
right right before they start to feel a

1407
01:16:00,989 --> 01:16:04,800
problem no give up on that goal it's a

1408
01:16:04,800 --> 01:16:07,260
bad goal will drive you crazy it's not

1409
01:16:07,260 --> 01:16:11,639
achievable you can say is that

1410
01:16:11,639 --> 01:16:15,630
universally true yeah so caveat I am

1411
01:16:15,630 --> 01:16:17,369
speaking primarily to software

1412
01:16:17,369 --> 01:16:18,989
engineering software dinner's here and

1413
01:16:18,989 --> 01:16:21,210
software engineering type you know

1414
01:16:21,210 --> 01:16:23,699
operations absolutely if the disk is

1415
01:16:23,699 --> 01:16:25,130
filling up at a certain rate

1416
01:16:25,130 --> 01:16:28,830
you should paid yourself before they

1417
01:16:28,830 --> 01:16:30,150
fill us up and starts affecting your

1418
01:16:30,150 --> 01:16:33,570
users in my mind I kind of clearly

1419
01:16:33,570 --> 01:16:37,980
delineate between it's not as clear-cut

1420
01:16:37,980 --> 01:16:40,530
as this but like you use monitoring to

1421
01:16:40,530 --> 01:16:43,199
monitor infrastructure stuff and you

1422
01:16:43,199 --> 01:16:46,489
lose observability you use observer

1423
01:16:47,360 --> 01:16:51,020
mmm-hmm the stuff that you're writing

1424
01:16:51,020 --> 01:16:53,639
monitoring has four things is chipping

1425
01:16:53,639 --> 01:16:54,840
Cheddar's for things as a slow have a

1426
01:16:54,840 --> 01:16:56,820
slow rate of change and increasingly

1427
01:16:56,820 --> 01:16:58,080
they're just things could be outsourced

1428
01:16:58,080 --> 01:16:59,550
to a list with third-party provider of

1429
01:16:59,550 --> 01:17:01,860
some sort and observability stuff is

1430
01:17:01,860 --> 01:17:04,199
stuff that you cannot outsource because

1431
01:17:04,199 --> 01:17:07,230
it is your business's reason for

1432
01:17:07,230 --> 01:17:09,630
existing yeah right it has a high rate

1433
01:17:09,630 --> 01:17:12,980
of change high degree of complexity uh

1434
01:17:12,980 --> 01:17:15,960
and a very low degree of predictability

1435
01:17:15,960 --> 01:17:19,169
and so for

1436
01:17:19,169 --> 01:17:21,209
I'm glad I'm talking this through I

1437
01:17:21,209 --> 01:17:22,499
hadn't actually really tease that out in

1438
01:17:22,499 --> 01:17:25,139
my own instruction moment and so in the

1439
01:17:25,139 --> 01:17:31,530
context of you know writing software I'm

1440
01:17:31,530 --> 01:17:32,969
not gonna tell you you should adopt SLO

1441
01:17:32,969 --> 01:17:34,349
speech adopts you should do I suppose

1442
01:17:34,349 --> 01:17:36,389
there are ways to do it without going

1443
01:17:36,389 --> 01:17:38,610
whole hog Ennis lows but really you have

1444
01:17:38,610 --> 01:17:40,050
to tightly constrain the alerts that

1445
01:17:40,050 --> 01:17:41,999
you're willing to send to all my users

1446
01:17:41,999 --> 01:17:54,749
in pain you just do policy doc it's a

1447
01:17:54,749 --> 01:17:58,579
great idea uh but I really think of

1448
01:17:58,579 --> 01:18:00,209
we're behind when it comes

1449
01:18:00,209 --> 01:18:01,050
instrumentations I think of

1450
01:18:01,050 --> 01:18:03,479
instrumentation as your documentation

1451
01:18:03,479 --> 01:18:05,130
your run books for your code yeah you

1452
01:18:05,130 --> 01:18:08,550
come at your code that's that is the

1453
01:18:08,550 --> 01:18:10,559
humans who are like talking to each

1454
01:18:10,559 --> 01:18:14,519
other in the code and this is for the

1455
01:18:14,519 --> 01:18:17,579
people who are running your systems like

1456
01:18:17,579 --> 01:18:19,909
instrumentation is your codes self

1457
01:18:19,909 --> 01:18:23,519
documenting function for future you at

1458
01:18:23,519 --> 01:18:25,729
2:00 a.m. who's had a couple beers and

1459
01:18:25,729 --> 01:18:31,860
has to figure out so be kind of

1460
01:18:31,860 --> 01:18:36,239
future you document by instrumentation

1461
01:18:36,239 --> 01:18:37,889
yeah am i succeeding a 10-minute warning

1462
01:18:37,889 --> 01:18:40,709
cuz it's like four minutes left

1463
01:18:40,709 --> 01:18:42,239
according to my clock but I thought I

1464
01:18:42,239 --> 01:18:44,010
was getting a warning am I gonna cut off

1465
01:18:44,010 --> 01:18:47,939
it mmm I don't know okay I'm just gonna

1466
01:18:47,939 --> 01:18:54,050
keep talking till somebody tells me um

1467
01:18:57,860 --> 01:19:00,570
they're lovely ideal but in fact your

1468
01:19:00,570 --> 01:19:02,840
code is changing too fast for you to

1469
01:19:02,840 --> 01:19:05,459
document it's like somebody assigned you

1470
01:19:05,459 --> 01:19:07,619
a bug in the tracker right what are you

1471
01:19:07,619 --> 01:19:09,959
gonna go do go right and alert and some

1472
01:19:09,959 --> 01:19:11,669
documentation for it or are you going to

1473
01:19:11,669 --> 01:19:13,919
go fix it I assume you're gonna go fix

1474
01:19:13,919 --> 01:19:16,530
it again it's like getting back to that

1475
01:19:16,530 --> 01:19:18,840
hole each time you get alerted it should

1476
01:19:18,840 --> 01:19:21,749
probably be for something new because

1477
01:19:21,749 --> 01:19:23,010
things are changing all the time now I

1478
01:19:23,010 --> 01:19:25,469
do think that one form of documentation

1479
01:19:25,469 --> 01:19:27,179
and microservices environment is

1480
01:19:27,179 --> 01:19:30,030
non-negotiable and that is almost like

1481
01:19:30,030 --> 01:19:32,300
dating profiles for each service

1482
01:19:32,300 --> 01:19:35,270
here's my name here's what I do

1483
01:19:35,270 --> 01:19:37,220
here's my point of contact all right

1484
01:19:37,220 --> 01:19:39,460
that that's less useful that metaphor

1485
01:19:39,460 --> 01:19:42,080
but like here's a good starting point

1486
01:19:42,080 --> 01:19:44,270
here's who I interact with here is the

1487
01:19:44,270 --> 01:19:45,800
data sources that I depend on all right

1488
01:19:45,800 --> 01:19:48,230
this stuff is not changing frequently

1489
01:19:48,230 --> 01:19:51,590
it's incredibly important everyone needs

1490
01:19:51,590 --> 01:19:55,600
to know five minutes thank you

1491
01:20:00,670 --> 01:20:02,900
documentation don't get too hung up on

1492
01:20:02,900 --> 01:20:07,700
it um let's see high-level checks not

1493
01:20:07,700 --> 01:20:11,150
hyper specific checks you know like it

1494
01:20:11,150 --> 01:20:12,650
is a waste of time to write a bunch of

1495
01:20:12,650 --> 01:20:13,880
hyper specific manner checks and I think

1496
01:20:13,880 --> 01:20:16,150
I understand why we've done this I

1497
01:20:16,150 --> 01:20:18,710
really really do we have done this

1498
01:20:18,710 --> 01:20:20,930
because it was the only way that we had

1499
01:20:20,930 --> 01:20:25,040
to debug things was like yeah page

1500
01:20:25,040 --> 01:20:26,570
bottom yourself basically with like

1501
01:20:26,570 --> 01:20:28,460
alerts firing from all over the statue

1502
01:20:28,460 --> 01:20:31,070
like this and you could just sit back

1503
01:20:31,070 --> 01:20:33,830
and serve it and go ah the shape of that

1504
01:20:33,830 --> 01:20:36,050
all of these alerts looks like you know

1505
01:20:36,050 --> 01:20:38,180
the last time that I saw that is this

1506
01:20:38,180 --> 01:20:39,860
you know we're relying it because our

1507
01:20:39,860 --> 01:20:42,190
systems gotten way too complex for us to

1508
01:20:42,190 --> 01:20:45,380
use simple metric but like dad it's not

1509
01:20:45,380 --> 01:20:48,140
debugging that it's not debugging that

1510
01:20:48,140 --> 01:20:50,660
is a crutch it will screw you and your

1511
01:20:50,660 --> 01:20:54,710
team over again there is a place for

1512
01:20:54,710 --> 01:21:07,690
hyper specific checks but it's not um

1513
01:21:07,690 --> 01:21:11,300
it's not like like bottom line skipping

1514
01:21:11,300 --> 01:21:12,200
through to the end

1515
01:21:12,200 --> 01:21:15,250
really it's not about preventing failure

1516
01:21:15,250 --> 01:21:17,360
because you're you're already gonna do

1517
01:21:17,360 --> 01:21:19,310
that I'm madly right like you're gonna

1518
01:21:19,310 --> 01:21:20,750
try and prevent feel like it's about

1519
01:21:20,750 --> 01:21:22,850
absorbing failures its reliability it's

1520
01:21:22,850 --> 01:21:24,380
not not about making a system to not

1521
01:21:24,380 --> 01:21:26,600
fail it's not making it so that it could

1522
01:21:26,600 --> 01:21:29,090
absorb as many failures as possible

1523
01:21:29,090 --> 01:21:34,430
without your users noticing static

1524
01:21:34,430 --> 01:21:36,110
dashboards are where debugging goes to

1525
01:21:36,110 --> 01:21:42,950
die and and if you can't like your goal

1526
01:21:42,950 --> 01:21:44,630
should be to have a way to alert

1527
01:21:44,630 --> 01:21:45,889
yourself

1528
01:21:45,889 --> 01:21:48,020
with a link relevant link because it

1529
01:21:48,020 --> 01:21:49,550
drops you into the high level you know

1530
01:21:49,550 --> 01:21:51,469
the SLO type saying you're violating

1531
01:21:51,469 --> 01:21:53,179
this out SLO or you are on track to

1532
01:21:53,179 --> 01:21:54,860
violate this SLO within this amount of

1533
01:21:54,860 --> 01:21:57,560
time right you should be able to click

1534
01:21:57,560 --> 01:21:59,119
on that and slicing dicing go all the

1535
01:21:59,119 --> 01:22:01,070
way down to the raw results you should

1536
01:22:01,070 --> 01:22:05,360
not you know get paged by Nagios after

1537
01:22:05,360 --> 01:22:10,520
Jo okay like that's just every time you

1538
01:22:10,520 --> 01:22:11,750
have a specific question you think of

1539
01:22:11,750 --> 01:22:13,489
you would go grab your logs for that

1540
01:22:13,489 --> 01:22:15,440
thing happening it loves ya not

1541
01:22:15,440 --> 01:22:17,000
navigable if you don't know you're

1542
01:22:17,000 --> 01:22:19,489
looking for if you can't go from top to

1543
01:22:19,489 --> 01:22:23,270
bottom every single - tracing every

1544
01:22:23,270 --> 01:22:25,179
single hop that you make people take

1545
01:22:25,179 --> 01:22:27,320
copy pasting IDs when sitting together

1546
01:22:27,320 --> 01:22:29,420
you're gonna lose like 90 percent of

1547
01:22:29,420 --> 01:22:30,920
your engineers they're just not gonna be

1548
01:22:30,920 --> 01:22:32,080
willing to learn more than one system

1549
01:22:32,080 --> 01:22:34,639
the human being the glue between all

1550
01:22:34,639 --> 01:22:37,580
these systems is it is lossy it is

1551
01:22:37,580 --> 01:22:40,270
confusing it is terrible and unnecessary

1552
01:22:40,270 --> 01:22:49,340
um and I think racing here you should

1553
01:22:49,340 --> 01:22:51,199
lastly Leslie you shouldn't alert the

1554
01:22:51,199 --> 01:22:52,520
light you shouldn't have to look at the

1555
01:22:52,520 --> 01:22:55,429
dash words unless they alert you no no

1556
01:22:55,429 --> 01:23:00,800
no no no no no no no no every single day

1557
01:23:00,800 --> 01:23:02,540
like up to your knees in your own

1558
01:23:02,540 --> 01:23:04,699
production systems if you're not looking

1559
01:23:04,699 --> 01:23:05,840
at your systems while they're healthy

1560
01:23:05,840 --> 01:23:09,260
you are not going to know what's wrong

1561
01:23:09,260 --> 01:23:13,130
they're wrong Oh your gut think this

1562
01:23:13,130 --> 01:23:15,350
something seems fishy here you should be

1563
01:23:15,350 --> 01:23:17,510
so familiar with your productions you

1564
01:23:17,510 --> 01:23:19,880
should have one window open with your

1565
01:23:19,880 --> 01:23:22,489
IDE editing code you know shipping it

1566
01:23:22,489 --> 01:23:25,219
whatever and another open right next to

1567
01:23:25,219 --> 01:23:27,139
it watching your code run in production

1568
01:23:27,139 --> 01:23:29,360
you should be muscle memory for you that

1569
01:23:29,360 --> 01:23:31,610
once you ship you ship something you go

1570
01:23:31,610 --> 01:23:33,440
and look at it this is why you should

1571
01:23:33,440 --> 01:23:35,570
only ship one disk instead of just at a

1572
01:23:35,570 --> 01:23:37,699
time so you can isolate yours you should

1573
01:23:37,699 --> 01:23:39,710
be writing instrumentation so that you

1574
01:23:39,710 --> 01:23:41,449
can look at it look at your code through

1575
01:23:41,449 --> 01:23:42,770
the lens of your own instrumentation

1576
01:23:42,770 --> 01:23:45,860
after you've deployed it and then you

1577
01:23:45,860 --> 01:23:47,330
need to close the loop and go and look

1578
01:23:47,330 --> 01:23:49,760
at it I swear to god you will catch 80

1579
01:23:49,760 --> 01:23:52,880
90 percent of all problems before your

1580
01:23:52,880 --> 01:23:54,770
users even have the chance to notice if

1581
01:23:54,770 --> 01:23:57,560
you just build that habit of going and

1582
01:23:57,560 --> 01:23:59,210
looking at it

1583
01:23:59,210 --> 01:24:02,270
the alternative is you're gonna delete

1584
01:24:02,270 --> 01:24:05,090
all of your pages and they go we have to

1585
01:24:05,090 --> 01:24:07,160
look at it and and your systems will get

1586
01:24:07,160 --> 01:24:09,440
worse so we worse and they do not have

1587
01:24:09,440 --> 01:24:12,590
to you should not be looking yeah I

1588
01:24:12,590 --> 01:24:16,580
don't like it because you're not looking

1589
01:24:16,580 --> 01:24:18,950
at it your job is not done job's not

1590
01:24:18,950 --> 01:24:20,030
done until you have looked at your own

1591
01:24:20,030 --> 01:24:22,880
code running pod and I think that I'm a

1592
01:24:22,880 --> 01:24:24,710
minute and a half over right Mike

1593
01:24:24,710 --> 01:24:26,660
sorry I didn't get to have enough time

1594
01:24:26,660 --> 01:24:29,480
for a question that was that was my bad

1595
01:24:29,480 --> 01:24:32,660
no worries no worries charity but I

1596
01:24:32,660 --> 01:24:34,670
appreciate you coming on I mean it's

1597
01:24:34,670 --> 01:24:38,180
it's really late I know all the

1598
01:24:38,180 --> 01:24:41,710
technical difficulties we're having but

1599
01:24:41,710 --> 01:24:44,150
you make some great points about

1600
01:24:44,150 --> 01:24:46,520
observer ability I mean about looking at

1601
01:24:46,520 --> 01:24:48,230
the dashboards I'm not the only one

1602
01:24:48,230 --> 01:24:49,460
who's saying it our customers have

1603
01:24:49,460 --> 01:24:51,440
started tweeting and going oh my god

1604
01:24:51,440 --> 01:24:53,150
like I moved to a salute based learning

1605
01:24:53,150 --> 01:24:55,100
observability and deleted any percent of

1606
01:24:55,100 --> 01:25:01,700
my alerts so now I'm not right

1607
01:25:01,700 --> 01:25:07,310
now we don't have any questions yeah if

1608
01:25:07,310 --> 01:25:11,000
you want to yeah but that I know there

1609
01:25:11,000 --> 01:25:12,620
they were there are some people that

1610
01:25:12,620 --> 01:25:15,830
will be posting it in the slag Channel

1611
01:25:15,830 --> 01:25:20,870
so if you have maybe fathers around yeah

1612
01:25:20,870 --> 01:25:22,910
they'll be very literally happy

1613
01:25:22,910 --> 01:25:25,190
yep yeah they were asking for the slides

1614
01:25:25,190 --> 01:25:27,590
so if I don't know if you have any to

1615
01:25:27,590 --> 01:25:29,480
share you can share them out there to

1616
01:25:29,480 --> 01:25:33,740
share the link sure will do okay sounds

1617
01:25:33,740 --> 01:25:36,340
great thank you very much for coming on

1618
01:25:36,340 --> 01:25:44,140
thank you I just
