2
00:00:01,920 --> 00:00:03,040
will work well

3
00:00:03,040 --> 00:00:05,920

cheryl's going to be talking to us a

43
00:01:33,439 --> 00:01:35,520
little bit about how cloud native

44
00:01:35,520 --> 00:01:38,560
is being adopted and what is coming next

45
00:01:38,560 --> 00:01:42,159

50
00:01:50,479 --> 00:01:51,280
the trends over

51
00:01:51,280 --> 00:01:54,320
the last few years so so cheryl i'll

52
00:01:54,320 --> 00:01:56,240
pass over to you

53
00:01:56,240 --> 00:02:01,520
great thank you simon so i will share my

54
00:02:06,840 --> 00:02:09,840
screen

55
00:02:21,760 --> 00:02:24,000
so today i'm going to talk about how

56
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:24,800
cloud native

57
00:02:24,800 --> 00:02:27,040
is being adopted and look at some of the

58
00:02:27,040 --> 00:02:28,720
trends over the last few years

59
00:02:28,720 --> 00:02:32,160
and what is happening next

60
00:02:32,160 --> 00:02:34,720
so today i'm going to talk about three

61
00:02:34,720 --> 00:02:36,160
things in particular i'm going

62
00:02:36,160 --> 00:02:40,959
to talk about the infrastructure dilemma

63
00:02:40,959 --> 00:02:42,800
and then we're going to use some of the

64
00:02:42,800 --> 00:02:44,959
cncf survey results

65
00:02:44,959 --> 00:02:47,920
from the end of 2019 to explore how

66
00:02:47,920 --> 00:02:51,040
organizations are adopting cloud native

67
00:02:51,040 --> 00:02:52,800
and then we're going to do some live

68
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:54,720
polling as well because i'm

69
00:02:54,720 --> 00:02:57,200
interested to hear what you're doing and

70
00:02:57,200 --> 00:02:59,440
how you're using cloud native

71
00:02:59,440 --> 00:03:05,840
so if you have a phone or a laptop handy

72
00:03:13,920 --> 00:03:15,920
so a little bit about me i'm an

73
00:03:15,920 --> 00:03:18,000
ex-google software engineer

74
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:20,879
and i worked on google maps for about

75
00:03:20,879 --> 00:03:21,680
five years

76
00:03:21,680 --> 00:03:24,000
mainly writing c plus and deploying it

77
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:25,519
to borg

78
00:03:25,519 --> 00:03:27,840
so you could say that i've been thinking

79
00:03:27,840 --> 00:03:29,040
in containers

80
00:03:29,040 --> 00:03:32,720
for about a decade at this point

81
00:03:32,720 --> 00:03:36,480
and after google i went to a

82
00:03:36,480 --> 00:03:38,959
startup to be a developer advocate and

83
00:03:38,959 --> 00:03:40,799
then a devops manager

84
00:03:40,799 --> 00:03:43,440
and then now at the cncf my mission is

85
00:03:43,440 --> 00:03:45,920
to drive the adoption of cloud native

86
00:03:45,920 --> 00:03:47,760
and of open source

87
00:03:47,760 --> 00:03:49,920
i also run the cloud native london

88
00:03:49,920 --> 00:03:51,200
meetup group

89
00:03:51,200 --> 00:03:53,599
i talk to a lot of startups a lot of

90
00:03:53,599 --> 00:03:57,200
companies and i do a lot of talks

91
00:03:58,400 --> 00:04:01,040
so cloud native computing foundation is

92
00:04:01,040 --> 00:04:02,480
the non-profit

93
00:04:02,480 --> 00:04:05,920
that hosts about more than 40

94
00:04:05,920 --> 00:04:08,239
open source projects at this point but

95
00:04:08,239 --> 00:04:10,000
really it was founded as a home

96
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:13,360
for kubernetes initially so it's part of

97
00:04:13,360 --> 00:04:15,280
the linux foundation

98
00:04:15,280 --> 00:04:19,358
and since 2015 we've really grown to

99
00:04:19,358 --> 00:04:20,639
encompass not just

100
00:04:20,639 --> 00:04:23,520
orchestration but monitoring with

101
00:04:23,520 --> 00:04:24,560
prometheus

102
00:04:24,560 --> 00:04:27,360
logging the container runtimes different

103
00:04:27,360 --> 00:04:28,639
standards

104
00:04:28,639 --> 00:04:30,240
and lots and lots of other projects

105
00:04:30,240 --> 00:04:32,400
around cloud native

106
00:04:32,400 --> 00:04:35,040
and we have as a foundation it's a

107
00:04:35,040 --> 00:04:35,840
non-profit

108
00:04:35,840 --> 00:04:38,080
and of course this is all open source so

109
00:04:38,080 --> 00:04:39,040
we're primarily

110
00:04:39,040 --> 00:04:41,520
funded and supported through membership

111
00:04:41,520 --> 00:04:42,960
through companies who join

112
00:04:42,960 --> 00:04:45,758
the cncf

113
00:04:46,400 --> 00:04:49,440
so out of the more than 500 members

114
00:04:49,440 --> 00:04:51,680
i spend most of my time with the end

115
00:04:51,680 --> 00:04:53,120
user community

116
00:04:53,120 --> 00:04:55,600
which is about a quarter of all the

117
00:04:55,600 --> 00:04:56,960
companies

118
00:04:56,960 --> 00:04:59,840
so these are companies that range from

119
00:04:59,840 --> 00:05:00,720
finance

120
00:05:00,720 --> 00:05:04,639
retail banking

121
00:05:04,639 --> 00:05:10,320
startups huge companies a real mix

122
00:05:10,320 --> 00:05:13,680
so that is enough about me i told you

123
00:05:13,680 --> 00:05:15,360
about me so now i'm interested in

124
00:05:15,360 --> 00:05:17,120
hearing about you

125
00:05:17,120 --> 00:05:19,600
so if you have your phone or your laptop

126
00:05:19,600 --> 00:05:20,320

127
00:05:20,320 --> 00:05:23,600

cheryl dot com slash p

129
00:05:27,199 --> 00:05:28,880
and then i'm going to ask three

130
00:05:28,880 --> 00:05:30,639
questions about you

131
00:05:30,639 --> 00:05:32,960
and then later on i'm going to ask five

132
00:05:32,960 --> 00:05:34,720
questions about how you're using

133
00:05:34,720 --> 00:05:38,080
cloud native if you miss

134
00:05:38,080 --> 00:05:41,759
this link this uh oi shell.com

135
00:05:41,759 --> 00:05:44,880
p this is a redirect to a longer

136
00:05:44,880 --> 00:05:49,039
url so you can get that later

137
00:05:49,199 --> 00:05:52,320
okay so

138
00:05:52,320 --> 00:05:55,680
we're going to begin

139
00:05:56,400 --> 00:05:58,638
now

140
00:05:59,440 --> 00:06:02,800
okay so this poll is now live

141
00:06:02,800 --> 00:06:06,080
so if you missed that url before

142
00:06:06,080 --> 00:06:09,758
you can use this longer one

143
00:06:10,520 --> 00:06:12,240
pollf.comhung278

144
00:06:12,240 --> 00:06:14,560
and i can see that someone has already

145
00:06:14,560 --> 00:06:15,680
voted for

146
00:06:15,680 --> 00:06:17,120
no this is not their first time at a

147
00:06:17,120 --> 00:06:19,039
virtual conference

148
00:06:19,039 --> 00:06:22,080
so i'm going to wait for about 20

149
00:06:22,080 --> 00:06:22,720
seconds

150
00:06:22,720 --> 00:06:26,880
to see if anybody else wants to vote

151
00:06:30,080 --> 00:06:34,479
cool we've got a yes

152
00:06:34,479 --> 00:06:38,560
and if it's your first time then welcome

153
00:06:46,560 --> 00:06:50,160
okay feels like we're going to

154
00:06:50,319 --> 00:06:52,960
probably help still a couple more votes

155
00:06:52,960 --> 00:06:54,479

161
00:07:12,160 --> 00:07:14,880

00:07:35,680 --> 00:07:36,240
europe

173
00:07:36,240 --> 00:07:38,080
oh new zealand and australia a couple of

174
00:07:38,080 --> 00:07:41,919
people a couple of folks down there

175
00:07:42,840 --> 00:07:45,840
awesome

176
00:07:48,879 --> 00:07:52,000
nice i think somebody here is uh in the

177
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:52,960
bottom left

178
00:07:52,960 --> 00:07:56,160
landing in the ocean a couple of times

179
00:07:56,160 --> 00:07:57,360
but

180
00:07:57,360 --> 00:07:59,840
you

181
00:08:24,840 --> 00:08:27,840
you

182
00:08:33,679 --> 00:08:36,240
so apologies uh i think we're losing

183
00:08:36,240 --> 00:08:37,039
cheryl

184
00:08:37,039 --> 00:08:41,120
um so oh there we go cheryl's back

185
00:08:41,120 --> 00:08:42,320
we're just gonna make the question out

186
00:08:42,320 --> 00:08:44,640
but you're back might be it might be uh

187
00:08:44,640 --> 00:08:46,560
better connection cheryl if you drop the

188
00:08:46,560 --> 00:08:47,600
video on your

189
00:08:47,600 --> 00:08:50,720
uh on the feed sure i can do that

190
00:08:50,720 --> 00:08:52,720
but just drop the video let's see how

191
00:08:52,720 --> 00:08:54,959
that goes cool

192
00:08:54,959 --> 00:08:57,200
so what is your job title so we've got

193
00:08:57,200 --> 00:08:59,200
architect application developer

194
00:08:59,200 --> 00:09:02,640
backend developer engineering manager

195
00:09:02,640 --> 00:09:07,040
sre devops security or something else

196
00:09:07,040 --> 00:09:10,080
and if it's something else if if you can

197
00:09:10,080 --> 00:09:11,760
choose the closest one to what you're

198
00:09:11,760 --> 00:09:14,959
doing then that would be great

199
00:09:17,120 --> 00:09:19,839
cool so it seems like back-end developer

200
00:09:19,839 --> 00:09:20,320
and

201
00:09:20,320 --> 00:09:23,279
sres are most well represented

202
00:09:23,279 --> 00:09:24,560
application developer

203
00:09:24,560 --> 00:09:27,599
actually about even now

204
00:09:31,760 --> 00:09:34,839
very cool back end developer taking the

205
00:09:34,839 --> 00:09:37,839
lead

206
00:09:38,320 --> 00:09:40,720
awesome it is very very great very nice

207
00:09:40,720 --> 00:09:42,320
to meet all of you

208
00:09:42,320 --> 00:09:44,640
even if virtually from around the world

209
00:09:44,640 --> 00:09:45,680
and

210
00:09:45,680 --> 00:09:47,279
for the moment i'll pause on the

211
00:09:47,279 --> 00:09:49,519
questions keep going with the slides and

212
00:09:49,519 --> 00:09:50,880
then i'll come back to

213
00:09:50,880 --> 00:09:52,240
asking you about how you're running

214
00:09:52,240 --> 00:09:55,760
kubernetes and cloud native

215
00:10:00,800 --> 00:10:04,720
so what is the infrastructure dilemma

216
00:10:04,720 --> 00:10:08,399
so infrastructure has to do three things

217
00:10:08,399 --> 00:10:10,800
but really what it has to do is it has

218
00:10:10,800 --> 00:10:11,600
to remain

219
00:10:11,600 --> 00:10:14,959
both rock solid both absolutely stable

220
00:10:14,959 --> 00:10:17,519
and also handle massive rapid immediate

221
00:10:17,519 --> 00:10:18,880
change

222
00:10:18,880 --> 00:10:21,519
so infrastructure needs to be highly

223
00:10:21,519 --> 00:10:23,920
available

224
00:10:23,920 --> 00:10:25,680
it needs to be scalable so that if the

225
00:10:25,680 --> 00:10:27,600
demand goes up and down

226
00:10:27,600 --> 00:10:30,839
then the infrastructure can support that

227
00:10:30,839 --> 00:10:32,480
elasticity

228
00:10:32,480 --> 00:10:35,440
and it has to also scale on the supply

229
00:10:35,440 --> 00:10:36,160
side

230
00:10:36,160 --> 00:10:39,279
so as features come in you have to be

231
00:10:39,279 --> 00:10:41,040
able to do frequent deployment so you

232
00:10:41,040 --> 00:10:42,560
need to be able to roll back

233
00:10:42,560 --> 00:10:46,399
if something's going wrong so what does

234
00:10:46,399 --> 00:10:49,200
this actually look like

235
00:10:49,200 --> 00:10:51,279
so obviously we're in the middle of a

236
00:10:51,279 --> 00:10:52,720
really interesting and

237
00:10:52,720 --> 00:10:54,800
unprecedented situation right now which

238
00:10:54,800 --> 00:10:57,279
is the corona virus

239
00:10:57,279 --> 00:11:00,000
and slack everybody's working from home

240
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:01,040
now who can do

241
00:11:01,040 --> 00:11:03,279
so slack has been one of the companies

242
00:11:03,279 --> 00:11:05,839
who's really seen the demand

243
00:11:05,839 --> 00:11:08,640
so these stats are a couple of weeks old

244
00:11:08,640 --> 00:11:10,720
now they're from the middle of march

245
00:11:10,720 --> 00:11:14,720
but this uh graph in the top

246
00:11:14,720 --> 00:11:18,480
right hand corner the dotted blue line

247
00:11:18,480 --> 00:11:21,600
shows what they call the the cwt's

248
00:11:21,600 --> 00:11:22,320
connected

249
00:11:22,320 --> 00:11:24,959
workspace teams basically how many

250
00:11:24,959 --> 00:11:27,200
businesses are on slack

251
00:11:27,200 --> 00:11:30,000
and the dotted blue line shows what they

252
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:31,440
expected

253
00:11:31,440 --> 00:11:34,720
to get and the red line shows the

254
00:11:34,720 --> 00:11:36,000
massive jump

255
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:38,720
when the corona virus hit and therefore

256
00:11:38,720 --> 00:11:40,399
how many new businesses signed up to

257
00:11:40,399 --> 00:11:41,279
join slack

258
00:11:41,279 --> 00:11:44,480
in that short space of time and on march

259
00:11:44,480 --> 00:11:45,120
16th

260
00:11:45,120 --> 00:11:49,279
this is a screenshot from their internal

261
00:11:49,279 --> 00:11:52,560
slack teams and you can see that every

262
00:11:52,560 --> 00:11:54,560
15 minutes

263
00:11:54,560 --> 00:11:57,680
they would record a new another 100 000

264
00:11:57,680 --> 00:11:58,240
users

265
00:11:58,240 --> 00:12:01,600
joining every single 15 minutes from 7

266
00:12:01,600 --> 00:12:06,079
7 15 7 30 7 45 8 o'clock 8 15.

267
00:12:06,079 --> 00:12:08,240
and just imagine that's another 100 000

268
00:12:08,240 --> 00:12:10,880
people every single 15 minutes

269
00:12:10,880 --> 00:12:14,000
so the infrastructure needs to be able

270
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:15,120
to cope with this

271
00:12:15,120 --> 00:12:17,760
completely unexpected and unprecedented

272
00:12:17,760 --> 00:12:20,639
level of scale

273
00:12:22,320 --> 00:12:24,320
so you've heard about this cloud native

274
00:12:24,320 --> 00:12:25,600
thing right

275
00:12:25,600 --> 00:12:27,600
and actually this is something that

276
00:12:27,600 --> 00:12:29,040
cloud native is

277
00:12:29,040 --> 00:12:32,480
can help with so in the

278
00:12:32,480 --> 00:12:35,360
2019 survey we found that people valued

279
00:12:35,360 --> 00:12:36,720
the fact that you can get faster

280
00:12:36,720 --> 00:12:38,320
deployment times

281
00:12:38,320 --> 00:12:40,800
you can improve scalability and you can

282
00:12:40,800 --> 00:12:42,160
improve availability

283
00:12:42,160 --> 00:12:46,480
with cloud native but interestingly

284
00:12:46,480 --> 00:12:48,560
when google originally came up with the

285
00:12:48,560 --> 00:12:49,839
idea of borg

286
00:12:49,839 --> 00:12:53,200
and borg inspired kubernetes

287
00:12:53,200 --> 00:12:56,320
the reason was more for resource

288
00:12:56,320 --> 00:12:58,399
efficiency the ability to pack

289
00:12:58,399 --> 00:12:59,680
applications closer

290
00:12:59,680 --> 00:13:02,240
and therefore make better use of server

291
00:13:02,240 --> 00:13:05,440
and utilize servers more

292
00:13:05,440 --> 00:13:08,639
more usefully more

293
00:13:08,639 --> 00:13:11,360
efficiently

294
00:13:16,320 --> 00:13:21,839
we found is actually the least important

295
00:13:22,480 --> 00:13:24,399
companies and people getting from cloud

296
00:13:24,399 --> 00:13:27,760
native which i think is

297
00:13:30,720 --> 00:13:35,839
included is really easy

298
00:13:38,480 --> 00:13:40,160
open source projects and some of the

299
00:13:40,160 --> 00:13:41,519
companies and products that

300
00:13:41,519 --> 00:13:44,320
are available out there so where do you

301
00:13:44,320 --> 00:13:49,839
even get started

302
00:13:49,920 --> 00:13:51,680
well i think a good place to get started

303
00:13:51,680 --> 00:13:53,360
is to look at what other people are

304
00:13:53,360 --> 00:13:54,639
doing

305
00:13:54,639 --> 00:13:56,800
and as i said to look at what you're

306
00:13:56,800 --> 00:13:57,680
doing

307
00:13:57,680 --> 00:13:59,360
so get ready with your phones and

308
00:13:59,360 --> 00:14:01,040
laptops again because i'm going to start

309
00:14:01,040 --> 00:14:03,040
asking a couple of questions

310
00:14:03,040 --> 00:14:06,320
and then we're going to compare what

311
00:14:06,320 --> 00:14:07,839
the group of people who are listening

312
00:14:07,839 --> 00:14:09,600
right now are doing with

313
00:14:09,600 --> 00:14:13,600
what the cncf survey said from 2019

314
00:14:13,600 --> 00:14:17,839
and the last couple of years

315
00:14:18,079 --> 00:14:20,399
so the first question is how many

316
00:14:20,399 --> 00:14:21,199
containers

317
00:14:21,199 --> 00:14:25,120
do you run in production

318
00:14:28,560 --> 00:14:31,440
so if you only run it in development and

319
00:14:31,440 --> 00:14:31,839
test

320
00:14:31,839 --> 00:14:34,560
then please choose the first option not

321
00:14:34,560 --> 00:14:35,600
applicable

322
00:14:35,600 --> 00:14:37,760
otherwise you can choose from less than

323
00:14:37,760 --> 00:14:40,079
50 50 to 249

324
00:14:40,079 --> 00:14:43,279
250 to 999

325
00:14:43,279 --> 00:14:45,040
thousand to four thousand nine hundred

326
00:14:45,040 --> 00:14:46,639
ninety nine or more than

327
00:14:46,639 --> 00:14:49,279
five thousand

328
00:14:51,279 --> 00:14:53,760
also about forty percent of people say

329
00:14:53,760 --> 00:14:55,199
they're not running

330
00:14:55,199 --> 00:14:58,560
containers in production most of the

331
00:14:58,560 --> 00:15:00,079
people who are seem to be running

332
00:15:00,079 --> 00:15:01,440
between

333
00:15:01,440 --> 00:15:04,560
50 and a thousand maybe a

334
00:15:04,560 --> 00:15:06,880
slightly more towards the higher side

335
00:15:06,880 --> 00:15:09,199
nobody's running more than 5000 which i

336
00:15:09,199 --> 00:15:09,519
find

337
00:15:09,519 --> 00:15:11,519
interesting or even more than one

338
00:15:11,519 --> 00:15:13,920
thousand

339
00:15:20,160 --> 00:15:23,120
cool so the answers seem to have settled

340
00:15:23,120 --> 00:15:23,519
so

341
00:15:23,519 --> 00:15:26,000
i'm going to now ask the same question

342
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:27,279
to you

343
00:15:27,279 --> 00:15:30,800
on how many kubernetes production

344
00:15:30,800 --> 00:15:33,839
clusters do you run

345
00:15:33,839 --> 00:15:36,240
so if you don't run any kubernetes

346
00:15:36,240 --> 00:15:38,000
production clusters at all or if you

347
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:38,959
only run

348
00:15:38,959 --> 00:15:41,680
if you run kubernetes but not in

349
00:15:41,680 --> 00:15:42,720
production

350
00:15:42,720 --> 00:15:45,040
then you can choose not applicable

351
00:15:45,040 --> 00:15:47,600
otherwise you can choose from

352
00:15:47,600 --> 00:15:55,839
anywhere between one to more than 50.

353
00:15:57,040 --> 00:16:00,079
okay so 50 roughly you're not running

354
00:16:00,079 --> 00:16:03,839
kubernetes production clusters

355
00:16:04,480 --> 00:16:06,560
i'm guessing most people running two to

356
00:16:06,560 --> 00:16:08,000
five because i might have a

357
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:10,560
production cluster and a development

358
00:16:10,560 --> 00:16:13,040
cluster

359
00:16:13,279 --> 00:16:15,120
a handful of people are running up to

360
00:16:15,120 --> 00:16:16,720
20.

361
00:16:16,720 --> 00:16:20,079
i would be interested to hear why

362
00:16:20,079 --> 00:16:21,279
how you're actually splitting these

363
00:16:21,279 --> 00:16:23,600
across clusters whether it's across

364
00:16:23,600 --> 00:16:25,279
like availability zones or whether you

365
00:16:25,279 --> 00:16:29,519
do it across teams or something else

366
00:16:30,320 --> 00:16:32,880
of course about 40 are not running

367
00:16:32,880 --> 00:16:33,920
kubernetes

368
00:16:33,920 --> 00:16:37,040
production clusters and then

369
00:16:37,040 --> 00:16:40,320
two to five seems like the

370
00:16:40,320 --> 00:16:44,240
the biggest uh grouping

371
00:16:44,240 --> 00:16:47,360
for the people who are listening right

372
00:16:48,839 --> 00:16:50,240
now

373
00:16:50,240 --> 00:16:53,920
okay so let's compare that to what the

374
00:16:53,920 --> 00:16:58,160
survey results showed us so

375
00:16:58,160 --> 00:17:01,279
what we've seen so this 2019 survey was

376
00:17:01,279 --> 00:17:03,040
the seventh time that we've won

377
00:17:03,040 --> 00:17:05,439
this survey so we can look back over the

378
00:17:05,439 --> 00:17:08,559
last few years from 2016 onwards

379
00:17:08,559 --> 00:17:11,599
so the pink bar on the left is 2016

380
00:17:11,599 --> 00:17:15,039
and the purple bar is the is last year

381
00:17:15,039 --> 00:17:17,599
so what we've seen is that over time the

382
00:17:17,599 --> 00:17:18,559
number of

383
00:17:18,559 --> 00:17:21,599
containers running production has has

384
00:17:21,599 --> 00:17:23,599
increased right so there are a few

385
00:17:23,599 --> 00:17:25,039
respondents who are running

386
00:17:25,039 --> 00:17:27,679
less than 50 and more and more who are

387
00:17:27,679 --> 00:17:28,960
running

388
00:17:28,960 --> 00:17:31,840
you know more than 250 more than a

389
00:17:31,840 --> 00:17:34,559
thousand and more than five thousand

390
00:17:34,559 --> 00:17:37,600
and the same is true for the

391
00:17:37,600 --> 00:17:39,840
number of production clusters of

392
00:17:39,840 --> 00:17:41,760
kubernetes

393
00:17:41,760 --> 00:17:44,720
so there are slightly fewer running one

394
00:17:44,720 --> 00:17:45,760
and slightly more

395
00:17:45,760 --> 00:17:49,600
running i think two to five as

396
00:17:49,600 --> 00:17:52,000
what we saw just now in our survey is

397
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:52,640
the

398
00:17:52,640 --> 00:17:55,840
most popular answer and then

399
00:17:55,840 --> 00:17:58,080
going from sort of 11 onwards there's a

400
00:17:58,080 --> 00:17:59,840
there's a small number of companies who

401
00:17:59,840 --> 00:18:00,480
are running

402
00:18:00,480 --> 00:18:03,760
more than 50 clusters but mostly running

403
00:18:03,760 --> 00:18:04,400
in the

404
00:18:04,400 --> 00:18:07,840
you know one to 10 range

405
00:18:10,640 --> 00:18:13,039
and for the companies who are using

406
00:18:13,039 --> 00:18:14,480
kubernetes

407
00:18:14,480 --> 00:18:16,480
the most popular option is still the

408
00:18:16,480 --> 00:18:18,559
public cloud more than 60

409
00:18:18,559 --> 00:18:23,200
running in public cloud and right now

410
00:18:23,200 --> 00:18:26,400
managed kubernetes services are

411
00:18:26,400 --> 00:18:29,440
increasingly popular so eks

412
00:18:29,440 --> 00:18:33,840
gke and aks from the

413
00:18:33,840 --> 00:18:36,240
big three cloud providers and then

414
00:18:36,240 --> 00:18:37,760
there's a handful of people who are

415
00:18:37,760 --> 00:18:40,000
still who are running their own

416
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:41,280
kubernetes clusters

417
00:18:41,280 --> 00:18:43,440
either on-prem or in the cloud but not

418
00:18:43,440 --> 00:18:45,039
using a managed service

419
00:18:45,039 --> 00:18:46,480
sort of deploying and operating

420
00:18:46,480 --> 00:18:50,000
kubernetes themselves

421
00:18:54,400 --> 00:18:57,120
so what about what developer tools are

422
00:18:57,120 --> 00:18:58,559
using

423
00:18:58,559 --> 00:19:03,360
so developers are using minicube to

424
00:19:03,360 --> 00:19:05,840
deploy to develop contain that develop

425
00:19:05,840 --> 00:19:07,760
their applications

426
00:19:07,760 --> 00:19:11,679
locally and then packaging it using helm

427
00:19:11,679 --> 00:19:15,120
and using helm to deploy it as well

428
00:19:15,120 --> 00:19:18,799
so helm has consistently stayed

429
00:19:18,799 --> 00:19:22,160
very popular and the same is true

430
00:19:22,160 --> 00:19:24,400
of mini cube so these numbers haven't

431
00:19:24,400 --> 00:19:26,400
changed too much from the last

432
00:19:26,400 --> 00:19:28,880
two years

433
00:19:30,080 --> 00:19:33,120
on the operational side

434
00:19:33,120 --> 00:19:36,320
there's different ways that you can

435
00:19:36,320 --> 00:19:38,720
separate kubernetes applications

436
00:19:38,720 --> 00:19:41,200
so you can place applications in their

437
00:19:41,200 --> 00:19:42,559
own

438
00:19:42,559 --> 00:19:47,120
namespaces you can place them in labels

439
00:19:47,120 --> 00:19:50,000
separate clusters this is a quite

440
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:53,679
surprising result to me that

441
00:19:53,679 --> 00:19:59,120
more i use those occasions

442
00:20:00,080 --> 00:20:03,679
faster or if there's different clusters

443
00:20:03,679 --> 00:20:04,840
of running different kinds of

444
00:20:04,840 --> 00:20:06,159
applications

445
00:20:06,159 --> 00:20:08,159
but still we see that and people can

446
00:20:08,159 --> 00:20:09,200
choose more than one

447
00:20:09,200 --> 00:20:11,120
could choose more than one option here

448
00:20:11,120 --> 00:20:12,559
so a very very large number use

449
00:20:12,559 --> 00:20:14,640
namespaces to separate kubernetes

450
00:20:14,640 --> 00:20:15,760
applications

451
00:20:15,760 --> 00:20:18,400
and then a smaller number use clusters

452
00:20:18,400 --> 00:20:18,840
and

453
00:20:18,840 --> 00:20:22,000
labels and

454
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:24,080
we said before that one of the dilemmas

455
00:20:24,080 --> 00:20:25,120
of infrastructure

456
00:20:25,120 --> 00:20:28,640
is how do you scale applications

457
00:20:28,640 --> 00:20:30,640
to match the demands of something like

458
00:20:30,640 --> 00:20:32,400
the coronavirus

459
00:20:32,400 --> 00:20:35,440
so scaling auto scaling stateless

460
00:20:35,440 --> 00:20:36,480
applications

461
00:20:36,480 --> 00:20:40,000
is relatively trivial now about 70

462
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:42,240
of of companies auto scale their

463
00:20:42,240 --> 00:20:44,320
workloads either horizontally or

464
00:20:44,320 --> 00:20:48,559
vertically um stateful applications

465
00:20:48,559 --> 00:20:52,320
are significantly less databases even

466
00:20:52,320 --> 00:20:54,960
less than that

467
00:20:57,679 --> 00:21:00,159
and on the serverless side we kind of

468
00:21:00,159 --> 00:21:00,799
see some

469
00:21:00,799 --> 00:21:04,320
steady growth in interest so

470
00:21:04,320 --> 00:21:06,640
there are several options here hosted

471
00:21:06,640 --> 00:21:08,640
means something like aws lambda

472
00:21:08,640 --> 00:21:11,679
or google cloud functions or one of the

473
00:21:11,679 --> 00:21:14,000
ones provided by cloud provider

474
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:16,159
installable software is more like you're

475
00:21:16,159 --> 00:21:17,600
running your own

476
00:21:17,600 --> 00:21:20,799
clusters could be cloud could be on-prem

477
00:21:20,799 --> 00:21:22,960
and you're running kubernetes on them

478
00:21:22,960 --> 00:21:24,240
and then you run a layer

479
00:21:24,240 --> 00:21:26,880
on top of that for your serverless

480
00:21:26,880 --> 00:21:28,240
functions

481
00:21:28,240 --> 00:21:31,280
so aws out of the people who

482
00:21:31,280 --> 00:21:33,840
responded that they preferred to use a

483
00:21:33,840 --> 00:21:34,880
hosted platform

484
00:21:34,880 --> 00:21:37,919
aws lambda was the most popular and

485
00:21:37,919 --> 00:21:40,799
out of the people who said that they

486
00:21:40,799 --> 00:21:42,159
installed and

487
00:21:42,159 --> 00:21:45,120
run a framework themselves k native was

488
00:21:45,120 --> 00:21:47,120
the most popular

489
00:21:47,120 --> 00:21:48,960
and there's a slight drop in the number

490
00:21:48,960 --> 00:21:50,799
of people who said that they were

491
00:21:50,799 --> 00:21:54,080
planning to use it in 2018 and then

492
00:21:54,080 --> 00:21:56,799
those who are saying that now and

493
00:21:56,799 --> 00:21:58,720
increasing the ones who are using it

494
00:21:58,720 --> 00:22:00,400
so that means that serverless is

495
00:22:00,400 --> 00:22:02,640
maturing because there are

496
00:22:02,640 --> 00:22:05,039
previously people were investigating now

497
00:22:05,039 --> 00:22:08,320
they're actually using something

498
00:22:09,760 --> 00:22:11,919
and the overall result of this is more

499
00:22:11,919 --> 00:22:12,880
automation

500
00:22:12,880 --> 00:22:16,159
more frequent releases so the number of

501
00:22:16,159 --> 00:22:16,960
manual

502
00:22:16,960 --> 00:22:19,360
number of people doing manual releases

503
00:22:19,360 --> 00:22:21,440
has dropped steadily

504
00:22:21,440 --> 00:22:24,080
and the number of people who the number

505
00:22:24,080 --> 00:22:25,840
automated is roughly the same but

506
00:22:25,840 --> 00:22:29,200
this is quite interesting so

507
00:22:29,200 --> 00:22:32,320
companies are doing more hybrid

508
00:22:32,320 --> 00:22:34,159
sort of automating parts of what they

509
00:22:34,159 --> 00:22:36,559
can and then using their manual process

510
00:22:36,559 --> 00:22:38,240
for everything else

511
00:22:38,240 --> 00:22:40,320
so this is a trend that i expect to see

512
00:22:40,320 --> 00:22:41,600
more and more over time

513
00:22:41,600 --> 00:22:44,400
that fewer releases will be done

514
00:22:44,400 --> 00:22:45,919
manually and more will be

515
00:22:45,919 --> 00:22:49,120
automated and

516
00:22:49,120 --> 00:22:51,679
again this this comes back to that

517
00:22:51,679 --> 00:22:52,960
infrastructure dilemma

518
00:22:52,960 --> 00:22:55,200
of how do you do rapid deployment at the

519
00:22:55,200 --> 00:22:56,880
same time as

520
00:22:56,880 --> 00:22:59,600
keeping everything stable and we're

521
00:22:59,600 --> 00:23:00,960
really pleased that

522
00:23:00,960 --> 00:23:03,039
to see that the number of companies

523
00:23:03,039 --> 00:23:04,000
doing daily

524
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:09,840
and weekly releases

525
00:23:15,760 --> 00:23:18,240
because instead of doing monthly year

526
00:23:18,240 --> 00:23:19,919
quarterly or yearly

527
00:23:19,919 --> 00:23:22,559
these release cycles are smaller shorter

528
00:23:22,559 --> 00:23:23,360
and faster

529
00:23:23,360 --> 00:23:25,600
so that means they're less risky because

530
00:23:25,600 --> 00:23:26,559
people can deploy

531
00:23:26,559 --> 00:23:29,919
smaller units of work and be able to

532
00:23:29,919 --> 00:23:30,559
roll back

533
00:23:30,559 --> 00:23:33,520
more easily as well

534
00:23:34,559 --> 00:23:37,600
but of course not everything is

535
00:23:37,600 --> 00:23:40,799
perfect so i'm going to hand back to you

536
00:23:40,799 --> 00:23:42,720
and ask you what are some of the

537
00:23:42,720 --> 00:23:44,400
challenges that you've seen if you're

538
00:23:44,400 --> 00:23:44,880
running

539
00:23:44,880 --> 00:23:46,640
containers or if you're running cloud

540
00:23:46,640 --> 00:23:48,320
native uh

541
00:23:48,320 --> 00:23:50,640
if you're looking at it what other

542
00:23:50,640 --> 00:23:51,600
challenges so

543
00:23:51,600 --> 00:23:55,200
this one is like a reddits poll

544
00:23:55,200 --> 00:23:57,360
so you can add in some responses and

545
00:23:57,360 --> 00:23:59,440
then you can upvote and downvote

546
00:23:59,440 --> 00:24:02,799
other people's responses

547
00:24:02,799 --> 00:24:04,320
so i'm going to give a few seconds for

548
00:24:04,320 --> 00:24:07,360
you to think about it

549
00:24:17,200 --> 00:24:19,360
i don't have any responses yet but i

550
00:24:19,360 --> 00:24:21,360
find it okay we got one so

551
00:24:21,360 --> 00:24:25,840
lack of infrastructure and devops mostly

552
00:24:25,840 --> 00:24:29,039
proper full get ops process git ops is

553
00:24:29,039 --> 00:24:30,799
really interesting to me i think gitops

554
00:24:30,799 --> 00:24:33,039
can definitely

555
00:24:33,039 --> 00:24:34,559
i think it's the way to go but i think

556
00:24:34,559 --> 00:24:36,799
it's easier to say than it is to

557
00:24:36,799 --> 00:24:41,200
do there are a lot of good resources out

558
00:24:41,200 --> 00:24:41,600
there

559
00:24:41,600 --> 00:24:43,600
in terms of get ups but actually

560
00:24:43,600 --> 00:24:45,279
applying it is

561
00:24:45,279 --> 00:24:47,760
is a big change a big cultural change as

562
00:24:47,760 --> 00:24:49,679
well

563
00:24:49,679 --> 00:24:51,520
um learning curve is always a problem

564
00:24:51,520 --> 00:24:52,799
always always a problem

565
00:24:52,799 --> 00:24:56,080
i think this space moves so fast

566
00:24:56,080 --> 00:24:59,120
that even trying to stay on top of

567
00:24:59,120 --> 00:25:00,640
what's happening

568
00:25:00,640 --> 00:25:02,559
is kind of a full-time job never mind

569
00:25:02,559 --> 00:25:04,240
trying to adopt and actually build

570
00:25:04,240 --> 00:25:06,559
things

571
00:25:06,799 --> 00:25:10,320
so adoption across the team and dev pod

572
00:25:10,320 --> 00:25:13,440
parity yep again this comes

573
00:25:13,440 --> 00:25:15,840
down to the cultural changes across the

574
00:25:15,840 --> 00:25:16,559
team

575
00:25:16,559 --> 00:25:19,919
right it's quite easy now to add uh

576
00:25:19,919 --> 00:25:22,320
you know to spin up a cluster spinning

577
00:25:22,320 --> 00:25:23,039
up

578
00:25:23,039 --> 00:25:25,279
running in cluster running container is

579
00:25:25,279 --> 00:25:27,360
not a big deal

580
00:25:27,360 --> 00:25:29,679
getting lots of teams and lots of people

581
00:25:29,679 --> 00:25:30,720
to adopt that

582
00:25:30,720 --> 00:25:33,279
especially where you have a large

583
00:25:33,279 --> 00:25:34,159
organization

584
00:25:34,159 --> 00:25:37,039
and a lot of a lot of legacy that can be

585
00:25:37,039 --> 00:25:39,600
really hard

586
00:25:41,039 --> 00:25:42,799
lack of sufficient knowledge yeah i

587
00:25:42,799 --> 00:25:44,720
think this is kind of similar

588
00:25:44,720 --> 00:25:47,279
same as the learning curve managing

589
00:25:47,279 --> 00:25:48,720
databases

590
00:25:48,720 --> 00:25:52,480
um i come from a storage background so i

591
00:25:52,480 --> 00:25:54,240
absolutely agree that running stateful

592
00:25:54,240 --> 00:25:57,840
applications is really really hard

593
00:25:59,279 --> 00:26:02,080
so yeah learning curve education

594
00:26:02,080 --> 00:26:03,840
adoption

595
00:26:03,840 --> 00:26:07,760
yeah i agree with all of these

596
00:26:09,039 --> 00:26:12,320
okay so i think there's still a few more

597
00:26:12,320 --> 00:26:13,919
votes coming in so i'm going to give it

598
00:26:13,919 --> 00:26:18,880
give you another 10 seconds to keep

599
00:26:22,840 --> 00:26:25,840
voting

600
00:26:35,520 --> 00:26:38,559
cool seems like the the

601
00:26:38,559 --> 00:26:42,559
numbers have settled okay

602
00:26:42,799 --> 00:26:45,760
we're gonna keep going

603
00:26:46,559 --> 00:26:48,799
so this is actually quite similar to

604
00:26:48,799 --> 00:26:50,000
what we've seen

605
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:53,120
from the cncf survey as well

606
00:26:53,120 --> 00:26:56,480
so the so the cultural changes across

607
00:26:56,480 --> 00:26:57,760
the development team

608
00:26:57,760 --> 00:26:59,840
pretty much everybody is facing this

609
00:26:59,840 --> 00:27:01,520
same right now

610
00:27:01,520 --> 00:27:04,080
security and the complexity of the

611
00:27:04,080 --> 00:27:05,360
overall solution

612
00:27:05,360 --> 00:27:08,720
were also very common responses lack of

613
00:27:08,720 --> 00:27:09,440
training

614
00:27:09,440 --> 00:27:12,640
again that comes to the educational

615
00:27:12,640 --> 00:27:14,799
opportunities and the adoption across

616
00:27:14,799 --> 00:27:16,080
the team

617
00:27:16,080 --> 00:27:18,720
we found a drop from 2018 in this one

618
00:27:18,720 --> 00:27:19,760
the lack of training

619
00:27:19,760 --> 00:27:22,640
because more and more there are more

620
00:27:22,640 --> 00:27:23,440
options now

621
00:27:23,440 --> 00:27:26,159
out there now for training for example

622
00:27:26,159 --> 00:27:26,720
the

623
00:27:26,720 --> 00:27:28,880
the certified kubernetes administrator

624
00:27:28,880 --> 00:27:29,840
exam

625
00:27:29,840 --> 00:27:33,440
which the linux foundation runs all the

626
00:27:33,440 --> 00:27:35,440
the curriculum is open source so there's

627
00:27:35,440 --> 00:27:38,320
a lot of good content out there already

628
00:27:38,320 --> 00:27:41,520
on the technical side um compared to

629
00:27:41,520 --> 00:27:43,679
2018 we actually saw these numbers drop

630
00:27:43,679 --> 00:27:44,640
a little bit

631
00:27:44,640 --> 00:27:46,960
so particularly monitoring and

632
00:27:46,960 --> 00:27:49,039
networking used to be much greater

633
00:27:49,039 --> 00:27:49,600
problems

634
00:27:49,600 --> 00:27:51,600
used to be more than 50 of people ran

635
00:27:51,600 --> 00:27:52,640
into these problems

636
00:27:52,640 --> 00:27:57,200
and over time these are now dropping

637
00:27:58,240 --> 00:28:01,919
and in terms of service mesh and storage

638
00:28:01,919 --> 00:28:03,840
both of these have pink

639
00:28:03,840 --> 00:28:06,240
pink means evaluating purple means using

640
00:28:06,240 --> 00:28:08,159
it in production

641
00:28:08,159 --> 00:28:10,000
so you can see that although there is a

642
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:11,279
lot of interest

643
00:28:11,279 --> 00:28:12,880
the actual number of people using this

644
00:28:12,880 --> 00:28:15,360
in production is

645
00:28:15,360 --> 00:28:19,918
relatively small i would say

646
00:28:22,320 --> 00:28:26,159
okay so last two questions for you

647
00:28:26,159 --> 00:28:29,520
because these are always hot topics so

648
00:28:29,520 --> 00:28:31,919
if you're using a service mesh which

649
00:28:31,919 --> 00:28:34,080
ones are you using

650
00:28:34,080 --> 00:28:37,039
you have the option of envoy istio

651
00:28:37,039 --> 00:28:37,919
linker d

652
00:28:37,919 --> 00:28:41,440
conduit anything else

653
00:28:41,440 --> 00:28:44,640
not yet but we're considering maybe

654
00:28:44,640 --> 00:28:46,240
the next six months or a year or

655
00:28:46,240 --> 00:28:48,720
whatever or we have no plans at the

656
00:28:48,720 --> 00:28:49,200
moment

657
00:28:49,200 --> 00:28:58,000
to use a surface mesh

658
00:28:58,000 --> 00:29:00,240
so istio is looking like the most

659
00:29:00,240 --> 00:29:02,720
popular answer from those who are using

660
00:29:02,720 --> 00:29:04,000
it

661
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:07,760
but same as what we just saw in that

662
00:29:07,760 --> 00:29:08,799
survey

663
00:29:08,799 --> 00:29:11,120
so a large percentage of people are

664
00:29:11,120 --> 00:29:12,159
currently evaluating

665
00:29:12,159 --> 00:29:14,880
service meshes but have not yet actually

666
00:29:14,880 --> 00:29:15,679
deployed those

667
00:29:15,679 --> 00:29:18,799
into production

668
00:29:21,919 --> 00:29:25,440
and last last question

669
00:29:25,440 --> 00:29:29,520
for you so do you run

670
00:29:29,520 --> 00:29:32,720
stateful applications within kubernetes

671
00:29:32,720 --> 00:29:35,120
in other words are you using some kind

672
00:29:35,120 --> 00:29:36,240
of storage

673
00:29:36,240 --> 00:29:38,799
or are you just focusing on the

674
00:29:38,799 --> 00:29:42,158
stateless applications

675
00:29:47,279 --> 00:29:49,760
i should have yeah so you can say you

676
00:29:49,760 --> 00:29:51,440
don't run kubernetes or you're only

677
00:29:51,440 --> 00:29:52,000
running

678
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:54,880
kubernetes in devon test i'm interested

679
00:29:54,880 --> 00:29:55,360
in the

680
00:29:55,360 --> 00:30:00,240
stateless or stateful applications here

681
00:30:06,080 --> 00:30:08,000
so i i kind of like this as i said

682
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:09,360
storage is my

683
00:30:09,360 --> 00:30:11,440
is where i come from my background so

684
00:30:11,440 --> 00:30:13,440
i'm actually quite pleased to see that

685
00:30:13,440 --> 00:30:15,520
a third of people are running stateful

686
00:30:15,520 --> 00:30:18,080
applications within kubernetes

687
00:30:18,080 --> 00:30:19,679
i think this is a good sign and this is

688
00:30:19,679 --> 00:30:21,600
something that was much harder a few

689
00:30:21,600 --> 00:30:22,399
years ago

690
00:30:22,399 --> 00:30:25,039
compared to today but this said there's

691
00:30:25,039 --> 00:30:25,600
still

692
00:30:25,600 --> 00:30:29,840
space to grow and for this to mature

693
00:30:32,240 --> 00:30:33,440
and there's a lot of the questions for

694
00:30:33,440 --> 00:30:36,080
you so we're going to wrap up but i

695
00:30:36,080 --> 00:30:38,080

back to

703
00:30:52,159 --> 00:30:55,600
originally that slack how slack um

704
00:30:55,600 --> 00:30:58,000
dealt with the corona virus situation

705
00:30:58,000 --> 00:30:59,440
there's a full

706
00:30:59,440 --> 00:31:02,799
serv a full uh case study written about

707
00:31:02,799 --> 00:31:03,519
this

708
00:31:03,519 --> 00:31:05,519
which you should read and it's

709
00:31:05,519 --> 00:31:07,200
incredibly interesting goes into a lot

710
00:31:07,200 --> 00:31:08,399
more detail about

711
00:31:08,399 --> 00:31:11,360
how slack is using in particular storage

712
00:31:11,360 --> 00:31:14,080
uh vtest this storage product

713
00:31:14,080 --> 00:31:17,600
but this is the ceo of slack

714
00:31:17,600 --> 00:31:19,120
and he gave a shout out to the

715
00:31:19,120 --> 00:31:21,279
infrastructure engineers for keeping

716
00:31:21,279 --> 00:31:24,159
slack running through these crazy times

717
00:31:24,159 --> 00:31:26,880
and slack also contribute back to the

718
00:31:26,880 --> 00:31:28,480
community and contribute back to open

719
00:31:28,480 --> 00:31:29,360
source

720
00:31:29,360 --> 00:31:31,760
