1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,429
dream so welcome how great to having it

2
00:00:02,429 --> 00:00:03,540
hi

3
00:00:03,540 --> 00:00:06,540
I'm really excited so you're gonna be

4
00:00:06,540 --> 00:00:09,150
doing essentially a mini concert if I'm

5
00:00:09,150 --> 00:00:12,540
not wrong around how music and softly

6
00:00:12,540 --> 00:00:14,280
come together and where they cross parts

7
00:00:14,280 --> 00:00:18,029
that's correct yeah no I cannot wait do

8
00:00:18,029 --> 00:00:19,770
you want fries and share or was it just

9
00:00:19,770 --> 00:00:22,289
you yeah I've had screen to share I'll

10
00:00:22,289 --> 00:00:24,570
start right now thank you and then I'll

11
00:00:24,570 --> 00:00:27,590
add that in and we can get started

12
00:00:30,109 --> 00:00:31,309
perfect

13
00:00:31,309 --> 00:00:37,110
here we go take it away so welcome to

14
00:00:37,110 --> 00:00:40,680
this talk my name is Hana Lambert I'm an

15
00:00:40,680 --> 00:00:44,129
IT consultant at Infosys pours but when

16
00:00:44,129 --> 00:00:46,079
I'm not developing software I try to

17
00:00:46,079 --> 00:00:48,750
create as many musical moments for

18
00:00:48,750 --> 00:00:49,800
myself as possible

19
00:00:49,800 --> 00:00:52,530
so this talk essentially is about two of

20
00:00:52,530 --> 00:00:54,210
my most favorite things in the world and

21
00:00:54,210 --> 00:00:57,000
the first one is making music the second

22
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:59,219
one is developing software and although

23
00:00:59,219 --> 00:01:01,680
these two fields seem like two very

24
00:01:01,680 --> 00:01:04,650
different things they are actually more

25
00:01:04,650 --> 00:01:06,619
alike than you might think

26
00:01:06,619 --> 00:01:09,240
consider this list of verbs for example

27
00:01:09,240 --> 00:01:12,479
I can associate each one of them with

28
00:01:12,479 --> 00:01:15,479
software quite easily I can create

29
00:01:15,479 --> 00:01:17,460
software I can develop software I can

30
00:01:17,460 --> 00:01:20,100
program software craft software I can

31
00:01:20,100 --> 00:01:22,439
write software published software

32
00:01:22,439 --> 00:01:24,720
produced software and I can run my

33
00:01:24,720 --> 00:01:27,060
software but all these verbs also go

34
00:01:27,060 --> 00:01:29,820
very well with music I can create music

35
00:01:29,820 --> 00:01:32,390
develop music I can program my music

36
00:01:32,390 --> 00:01:34,799
DJ's are essentially programming their

37
00:01:34,799 --> 00:01:37,530
music right I can crop music writes

38
00:01:37,530 --> 00:01:39,600
music publish it produce it and of

39
00:01:39,600 --> 00:01:42,899
course everyone needs running music when

40
00:01:42,899 --> 00:01:44,670
we go out for our morning runs well

41
00:01:44,670 --> 00:01:46,200
maybe not so much in this time of

42
00:01:46,200 --> 00:01:48,689
pandemic but we used to do this and then

43
00:01:48,689 --> 00:01:51,720
we needed running music or 165 beats per

44
00:01:51,720 --> 00:01:54,630
minute mix and I think this example

45
00:01:54,630 --> 00:01:56,280
shows that music and software are very

46
00:01:56,280 --> 00:01:57,869
much alike because in order to produce

47
00:01:57,869 --> 00:02:01,320
it creativity is needed musicians and

48
00:02:01,320 --> 00:02:03,450
software developers they are not factory

49
00:02:03,450 --> 00:02:05,520
workers they don't just do a tiny part

50
00:02:05,520 --> 00:02:07,860
of a conveyor belt process or do the

51
00:02:07,860 --> 00:02:10,440
same task over and over again on the

52
00:02:10,440 --> 00:02:12,720
contrary they are craftspeople they

53
00:02:12,720 --> 00:02:13,800
shape and they

54
00:02:13,800 --> 00:02:15,750
hope their products until they are happy

55
00:02:15,750 --> 00:02:18,600
with it and you only allow yourself to

56
00:02:18,600 --> 00:02:21,530
stop working once you're happy with it

57
00:02:21,530 --> 00:02:24,090
now I think I've mentioned already that

58
00:02:24,090 --> 00:02:25,590
music and so far are two favorite

59
00:02:25,590 --> 00:02:27,930
hobbies of mine now I have managed to

60
00:02:27,930 --> 00:02:29,730
turn one of these hobbies into a career

61
00:02:29,730 --> 00:02:31,920
and during the stop you can make up your

62
00:02:31,920 --> 00:02:34,380
mind about which hobbies my career and

63
00:02:34,380 --> 00:02:36,450
which is not you know after you've heard

64
00:02:36,450 --> 00:02:40,080
music and seen the software I guess the

65
00:02:40,080 --> 00:02:43,200
bottom line is I love it when music and

66
00:02:43,200 --> 00:02:45,589
software

67
00:02:45,950 --> 00:02:54,900
come together over me and each time it

68
00:02:54,900 --> 00:02:58,470
happens I feel the happiest person on

69
00:02:58,470 --> 00:03:02,730
earth so in what ways do music and

70
00:03:02,730 --> 00:03:04,890
software come together well I can think

71
00:03:04,890 --> 00:03:06,990
of a number of ways let's demonstrate

72
00:03:06,990 --> 00:03:10,380
one possible way with a code example now

73
00:03:10,380 --> 00:03:12,120
I came across this code example on

74
00:03:12,120 --> 00:03:14,250
Twitter some time ago and it immediately

75
00:03:14,250 --> 00:03:18,090
made me very happy in fact being a

76
00:03:18,090 --> 00:03:20,940
musician I literally can't stop myself

77
00:03:20,940 --> 00:03:26,960
from singing along is this the real life

78
00:03:26,960 --> 00:03:38,000
is this just fantasy from reality

79
00:03:38,930 --> 00:03:42,139
[Music]

80
00:03:46,290 --> 00:03:51,429
[Music]

81
00:03:52,100 --> 00:03:59,420
sympathy because I'm easy come easy to

82
00:04:00,060 --> 00:04:12,440
[Music]

83
00:04:12,440 --> 00:04:15,330
me

84
00:04:15,330 --> 00:04:21,220
[Music]

85
00:04:21,220 --> 00:04:24,050
now this conference all the talks make

86
00:04:24,050 --> 00:04:27,020
all this talk as session but other

87
00:04:27,020 --> 00:04:29,080
conferences call this a lightning talk

88
00:04:29,080 --> 00:04:31,610
which is another reason why the COO in

89
00:04:31,610 --> 00:04:33,770
some is appropriate because of this far

90
00:04:33,770 --> 00:04:37,190
[Music]

91
00:04:39,740 --> 00:04:42,809
[Music]

92
00:04:44,949 --> 00:04:49,789
on that note here is another classic

93
00:04:49,789 --> 00:04:57,510
Switzer hits hate you you make is bad

94
00:04:57,510 --> 00:04:58,660
[Applause]

95
00:04:58,660 --> 00:05:05,199
you should fix that compiler error

96
00:05:05,440 --> 00:05:10,400
remember to let it search to pass then

97
00:05:10,400 --> 00:05:21,080
you can start to make it well maybe this

98
00:05:21,080 --> 00:05:23,570
is your doctoral Gianna at all so if you

99
00:05:23,570 --> 00:05:25,729
prefer a different from here's one for

100
00:05:25,729 --> 00:05:27,880
you

101
00:05:35,220 --> 00:05:39,730
[Music]

102
00:05:51,660 --> 00:05:54,789
[Music]

103
00:05:59,470 --> 00:06:13,280
why why it's MIT right wait this is a

104
00:06:13,280 --> 00:06:16,940
very deep perhaps even a little bit over

105
00:06:16,940 --> 00:06:19,340
the top because why should we mess with

106
00:06:19,340 --> 00:06:21,620
these original lyrics at all

107
00:06:21,620 --> 00:06:24,590
surely tons of popular songs can be

108
00:06:24,590 --> 00:06:26,510
applied to software engineering already

109
00:06:26,510 --> 00:06:28,460
without altering anything

110
00:06:28,460 --> 00:06:31,790
so let's embark on a small musical

111
00:06:31,790 --> 00:06:33,860
journey throughout a typical software

112
00:06:33,860 --> 00:06:36,440
development process why I guess because

113
00:06:36,440 --> 00:06:37,190
it will be fun

114
00:06:37,190 --> 00:06:39,590
because we're here anyway and it because

115
00:06:39,590 --> 00:06:42,260
me very happy and who knows maybe we

116
00:06:42,260 --> 00:06:44,270
will we will discover loads of songs

117
00:06:44,270 --> 00:06:47,390
that have been misinterpreted by the

118
00:06:47,390 --> 00:06:50,900
masses for years because everyone seems

119
00:06:50,900 --> 00:06:53,450
to think that in the end all songs are

120
00:06:53,450 --> 00:06:57,289
about love ill you know what these

121
00:06:57,289 --> 00:07:01,669
people are all wrong because all songs

122
00:07:01,669 --> 00:07:05,180
are actually about software developments

123
00:07:05,180 --> 00:07:10,669
yes all of them so all let's start out

124
00:07:10,669 --> 00:07:12,470
with our self redevelopment process and

125
00:07:12,470 --> 00:07:14,840
of course a typical one starts with

126
00:07:14,840 --> 00:07:17,419
gathering requirements now whenever a

127
00:07:17,419 --> 00:07:19,820
product owner comes to me with some

128
00:07:19,820 --> 00:07:21,560
requirements there was a product owner

129
00:07:21,560 --> 00:07:24,440
coming to me just this morning my music

130
00:07:24,440 --> 00:07:28,630
addicted brain immediately goes

131
00:07:28,700 --> 00:07:31,270
slow it down

132
00:07:31,270 --> 00:07:45,090
[Music]

133
00:07:45,090 --> 00:07:47,139
[Applause]

134
00:07:47,139 --> 00:07:49,840
my requirements are very rarely

135
00:07:49,840 --> 00:07:52,300
immediately clear I mean not off that a

136
00:07:52,300 --> 00:07:53,949
product owner has explained them just

137
00:07:53,949 --> 00:07:57,189
once so in a lot of cases requirements

138
00:07:57,189 --> 00:08:00,550
need to be refined right and in general

139
00:08:00,550 --> 00:08:02,710
I'm really eager for some refinement

140
00:08:02,710 --> 00:08:06,449
work why because it makes me very happy

141
00:08:06,449 --> 00:08:19,779
just to sing to my product owner so now

142
00:08:19,779 --> 00:08:21,250
suppose during the process

143
00:08:21,250 --> 00:08:23,529
the requirements very fine the story was

144
00:08:23,529 --> 00:08:25,270
made ready it's placed on the Sprint

145
00:08:25,270 --> 00:08:27,310
backlog now this means we can start

146
00:08:27,310 --> 00:08:29,979
implementing the requirements now when

147
00:08:29,979 --> 00:08:33,070
I'm coding numerous songs just happen to

148
00:08:33,070 --> 00:08:35,440
pop up inside my head for example when

149
00:08:35,440 --> 00:08:38,078
I'm calling a method called stuff my

150
00:08:38,078 --> 00:08:40,690
brain immediately fills up with hammer

151
00:08:40,690 --> 00:08:46,870
time can touch this no my head does this

152
00:08:46,870 --> 00:08:50,230
every single time it's a bit like a

153
00:08:50,230 --> 00:08:55,500
reflex because it happens instantly

154
00:09:00,260 --> 00:09:02,709
[Music]

155
00:09:02,709 --> 00:09:13,220
yeah it's real it's real don't you feel

156
00:09:13,220 --> 00:09:14,120
sorry for me

157
00:09:14,120 --> 00:09:20,029
I can't even turn it off now every time

158
00:09:20,029 --> 00:09:22,820
I'm doing some conditional logic this

159
00:09:22,820 --> 00:09:27,079
happens pain I just met you and this is

160
00:09:27,079 --> 00:09:31,459
crazy but here's my number so call me

161
00:09:31,459 --> 00:09:35,899
maybe you never know if that one's going

162
00:09:35,899 --> 00:09:37,390
to be cold

163
00:09:37,390 --> 00:09:39,769
or for example when I'm handling

164
00:09:39,769 --> 00:09:42,730
exceptions

165
00:09:51,690 --> 00:09:55,180
what you gotta do it's a handle that

166
00:09:55,180 --> 00:09:57,610
accepts and you silly and do it properly

167
00:09:57,610 --> 00:09:58,440
this time

168
00:09:58,440 --> 00:10:03,970
this is dreadful stuff so my brain is

169
00:10:03,970 --> 00:10:05,860
addicted to music now this didn't happen

170
00:10:05,860 --> 00:10:07,690
overnight it's been that way for as long

171
00:10:07,690 --> 00:10:09,820
as I can remember and the majority of

172
00:10:09,820 --> 00:10:11,380
things that happen to me immediately

173
00:10:11,380 --> 00:10:13,690
remind me of a song and when that

174
00:10:13,690 --> 00:10:15,250
happens I just can't stop myself from

175
00:10:15,250 --> 00:10:17,350
playing singing in lung though I suspect

176
00:10:17,350 --> 00:10:19,720
this was clear to you already now the

177
00:10:19,720 --> 00:10:21,130
question is should I be worried

178
00:10:21,130 --> 00:10:27,220
does this make me crazy does that make

179
00:10:27,220 --> 00:10:29,700
me crazy

180
00:10:31,830 --> 00:10:35,539
[Applause]

181
00:10:36,980 --> 00:10:43,920
[Music]

182
00:10:43,920 --> 00:10:46,629
now I've looked into it I've researched

183
00:10:46,629 --> 00:10:50,170
this song inception thing a bit and as

184
00:10:50,170 --> 00:10:53,980
it turns out everyone has disability in

185
00:10:53,980 --> 00:10:57,129
some way for example what does your

186
00:10:57,129 --> 00:11:07,930
brain tell you after hearing this you

187
00:11:07,930 --> 00:11:09,579
know when I'm doing this one during

188
00:11:09,579 --> 00:11:12,069
conferences I see the whole room go Ice

189
00:11:12,069 --> 00:11:14,920
Ice Baby I can't I can't hear you guys

190
00:11:14,920 --> 00:11:16,779
and girls right now but I'm assuming

191
00:11:16,779 --> 00:11:19,990
you're all going Ice Ice Baby it turns

192
00:11:19,990 --> 00:11:21,519
out there are two types of people in the

193
00:11:21,519 --> 00:11:23,680
world the ones who go is baby and the

194
00:11:23,680 --> 00:11:28,709
other ones and they will go pushing

195
00:11:31,440 --> 00:11:33,649
[Music]

196
00:11:33,649 --> 00:11:37,019
see you have it too so if you were

197
00:11:37,019 --> 00:11:39,300
laughing at me before just stop laughing

198
00:11:39,300 --> 00:11:42,269
at me or any at least start laughing at

199
00:11:42,269 --> 00:11:44,899
yourself because we have it to all so

200
00:11:44,899 --> 00:11:46,889
now you know what to do

201
00:11:46,889 --> 00:11:48,899
when asked during a job interview if you

202
00:11:48,899 --> 00:11:50,690
can perform under pressure

203
00:11:50,690 --> 00:11:54,120
you know this interviewer would go great

204
00:11:54,120 --> 00:11:57,300
so you can do Java Cobo Python Lisp and

205
00:11:57,300 --> 00:12:00,389
Haskell that's so great we use all five

206
00:12:00,389 --> 00:12:03,060
of them here also can you perform under

207
00:12:03,060 --> 00:12:05,040
pressure and you would just push back

208
00:12:05,040 --> 00:12:09,060
your chair get up and and go I mean they

209
00:12:09,060 --> 00:12:13,730
simply won't be able to assist you I

210
00:12:13,730 --> 00:12:15,839
think it's time for a little code

211
00:12:15,839 --> 00:12:17,760
example again now whenever I write a

212
00:12:17,760 --> 00:12:21,649
switch statement this often happens

213
00:12:28,960 --> 00:12:34,240
[Music]

214
00:12:37,569 --> 00:12:41,319
don't forget your break statements folks

215
00:12:41,319 --> 00:12:44,120
let's assume at this point in time your

216
00:12:44,120 --> 00:12:46,519
code is pretty much done and the next

217
00:12:46,519 --> 00:12:49,069
step is version control that the lyrics

218
00:12:49,069 --> 00:12:52,610
to the last song we did this contains

219
00:12:52,610 --> 00:12:55,459
really inspiring stuff in fact I think

220
00:12:55,459 --> 00:12:58,220
it's perfectly fine to use as commit

221
00:12:58,220 --> 00:13:03,550
messages haven't I told you make a wish

222
00:13:03,550 --> 00:13:07,639
take a chance make a change that last

223
00:13:07,639 --> 00:13:11,149
one is fantastic it's generic you can

224
00:13:11,149 --> 00:13:14,870
use it anywhere and of course after this

225
00:13:14,870 --> 00:13:17,810
amazing commit has been created we need

226
00:13:17,810 --> 00:13:20,000
to push it unless you're really into

227
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:22,790
merge conflicts of course but before we

228
00:13:22,790 --> 00:13:24,709
push our comments let's have a brief

229
00:13:24,709 --> 00:13:27,439
moment of honesty here search yourself

230
00:13:27,439 --> 00:13:28,939
for a moment and ask yourself the

231
00:13:28,939 --> 00:13:32,060
question do I have a song for this

232
00:13:32,060 --> 00:13:35,449
because I am quite sure everyone in this

233
00:13:35,449 --> 00:13:39,860
be it virtual room has this one song

234
00:13:39,860 --> 00:13:42,740
that you secretly hum to yourself each

235
00:13:42,740 --> 00:13:46,910
time you type get pushed for a lot of

236
00:13:46,910 --> 00:13:59,839
people it could be a push it push it and

237
00:13:59,839 --> 00:14:03,699
for others it might be this one

238
00:14:15,710 --> 00:14:21,410
[Music]

239
00:14:21,410 --> 00:14:24,300
State v is debugging let's face it

240
00:14:24,300 --> 00:14:27,270
nobody's perfect right so bugs will be

241
00:14:27,270 --> 00:14:29,310
found in your code and of course the

242
00:14:29,310 --> 00:14:31,230
most important question is when this

243
00:14:31,230 --> 00:14:33,810
happens well what do you think the most

244
00:14:33,810 --> 00:14:36,090
important question is is it how many

245
00:14:36,090 --> 00:14:38,430
books are there how will you fix them or

246
00:14:38,430 --> 00:14:42,780
how will you represent I think these

247
00:14:42,780 --> 00:14:44,190
questions are all wrong because when

248
00:14:44,190 --> 00:14:46,200
bugs are found in your code the most

249
00:14:46,200 --> 00:14:48,690
important question is what song will

250
00:14:48,690 --> 00:14:51,750
play inside your head when it happens

251
00:14:51,750 --> 00:14:53,880
well when the user files a defect in

252
00:14:53,880 --> 00:14:55,440
your ticketing system what would your

253
00:14:55,440 --> 00:14:59,300
most mature a responsible response be

254
00:14:59,300 --> 00:15:02,670
denial of course the first step of any

255
00:15:02,670 --> 00:15:05,580
healthy bug fixing process and to be

256
00:15:05,580 --> 00:15:07,440
fair also a bit of determination but

257
00:15:07,440 --> 00:15:09,840
both responses are addressed by this

258
00:15:09,840 --> 00:15:12,620
next song

[Music]

263
00:15:52,209 --> 00:15:55,180
now when this bug is persistent and

264
00:15:55,180 --> 00:15:57,620
denial no longer works we need a special

265
00:15:57,620 --> 00:15:59,720
bugs on to start the bug fixing so

266
00:15:59,720 --> 00:16:02,689
without further ado here it is the Box

267
00:16:02,689 --> 00:16:06,949
song when you tell you this but you

268
00:16:06,949 --> 00:16:13,129
don't succeed when you get what you want

269
00:16:13,129 --> 00:16:19,970
but you feel so tired

270
00:16:19,970 --> 00:16:35,559
if you can't see light

271
00:16:39,330 --> 00:16:47,950
[Music]

272
00:16:49,580 --> 00:16:53,240
to fix you

273
00:16:54,740 --> 00:16:58,560
now if fix you by coldplay is the debug

274
00:16:58,560 --> 00:17:00,660
so and then what would be a good

275
00:17:00,660 --> 00:17:03,530
debugging song mmm funny coincidence

276
00:17:03,530 --> 00:17:06,180
it's by the same band and the song is

277
00:17:06,180 --> 00:17:09,390
called the scientist now these following

278
00:17:09,390 --> 00:17:13,170
lyrics are so accurate I think in a past

279
00:17:13,170 --> 00:17:16,020
life Chris Martin was a software

280
00:17:16,020 --> 00:17:17,730
developer there simply is no other

281
00:17:17,730 --> 00:17:21,240
explanation because everyone's typical

282
00:17:21,240 --> 00:17:27,510
debugging session written I was just

283
00:17:27,510 --> 00:18:24,600
guessing your this I'm going back to the

284
00:18:24,600 --> 00:18:29,430
stuff and that happens a lot in a

285
00:18:29,430 --> 00:18:33,450
debugging session right now after fixing

286
00:18:33,450 --> 00:18:34,890
this bug we need another good commit

287
00:18:34,890 --> 00:18:36,960
message so I usually use the bridge from

288
00:18:36,960 --> 00:18:39,870
fix you to come up with one here it is

289
00:18:39,870 --> 00:18:44,450
tears stream down he goes

290
00:18:44,450 --> 00:18:49,710
I promise you I will learn from my

291
00:18:49,710 --> 00:18:55,200
mistakes now if you're doing DevOps

292
00:18:55,200 --> 00:18:58,020
or death check ups the final states in

293
00:18:58,020 --> 00:19:00,210
any case is UPS so imagine this software

294
00:19:00,210 --> 00:19:01,529
we created has been deployed to

295
00:19:01,529 --> 00:19:03,510
production and you've applied some

296
00:19:03,510 --> 00:19:05,760
monitoring tools now when you discover a

297
00:19:05,760 --> 00:19:07,440
process is stuck somehow you need to

298
00:19:07,440 --> 00:19:09,840
restart it right maybe even want this to

299
00:19:09,840 --> 00:19:11,880
be done automatically this for the sake

300
00:19:11,880 --> 00:19:14,250
of this talk let's assume you have to do

301
00:19:14,250 --> 00:19:15,710
it manually

302
00:19:15,710 --> 00:19:18,029
so what do you do you just end this

303
00:19:18,029 --> 00:19:20,450
faulty process and start a new one right

304
00:19:20,450 --> 00:19:39,659
like this in the name killing in the

305
00:19:39,659 --> 00:19:47,070
name map funny thing sometimes ending a

306
00:19:47,070 --> 00:19:49,230
process is not permitted or some some

307
00:19:49,230 --> 00:19:51,720
thing has been run while trying not sure

308
00:19:51,720 --> 00:19:54,240
why but this happens a lot of times so

309
00:19:54,240 --> 00:19:56,870
what do you do when the operation fails

310
00:19:56,870 --> 00:20:00,299
so you do you use pseudo kill - 9 right

311
00:20:00,299 --> 00:20:02,850
which is to me is also known as the Rage

312
00:20:02,850 --> 00:20:05,190
command because because of the psuedo

313
00:20:05,190 --> 00:20:08,010
because of the - 9 because it feels

314
00:20:08,010 --> 00:20:10,799
really good while listening to hard rock

315
00:20:10,799 --> 00:20:13,440
or metal because when I mean this come

316
00:20:13,440 --> 00:20:16,049
on I really get angry at people per se

317
00:20:16,049 --> 00:20:18,510
but but at my machine but my stupid

318
00:20:18,510 --> 00:20:21,240
laptop just like man named I've raged

319
00:20:21,240 --> 00:20:24,419
against my machine and and it also fits

320
00:20:24,419 --> 00:20:25,860
the following lyrics perfectly this

321
00:20:25,860 --> 00:20:28,279
command

322
00:20:28,960 --> 00:20:32,509
and how you do what they told ya and now

323
00:20:32,509 --> 00:20:35,629
you do what they told ya and now you do

324
00:20:35,629 --> 00:20:41,450
what they told ya no that's why it's

325
00:20:41,450 --> 00:20:45,649
called the rage come on okay

326
00:20:45,649 --> 00:20:48,379
so we're nearing the finish line now and

327
00:20:48,379 --> 00:20:50,629
I feel like you folks deserve a word of

328
00:20:50,629 --> 00:20:53,119
appreciation because you've stuck with

329
00:20:53,119 --> 00:20:56,179
me for the last 20 minutes or so which

330
00:20:56,179 --> 00:20:59,090
had some unconventional content in it to

331
00:20:59,090 --> 00:20:59,929
say the least

332
00:20:59,929 --> 00:21:03,379
so as a token of my appreciation please

333
00:21:03,379 --> 00:21:07,099
accept the following musical poem and I

334
00:21:07,099 --> 00:21:12,019
call it for the brave souls not for the

round of applause this was amazing I was

353
00:22:57,430 --> 00:22:59,530
I was actually wondering because I saw a

354
00:22:59,530 --> 00:23:02,350
version of this earlier like on J fall

355
00:23:02,350 --> 00:23:03,430
if I'm not mistaken

356
00:23:03,430 --> 00:23:05,560
like two years ago and it was like how

357
00:23:05,560 --> 00:23:09,340
are you going to do this on stream but

358
00:23:09,340 --> 00:23:11,620
you nailed it brother I just bought

359
00:23:11,620 --> 00:23:13,660
myself a ton of equipment and managed to

360
00:23:13,660 --> 00:23:18,340
do it this this this session was a lot

361
00:23:18,340 --> 00:23:22,120
of fun smile on everyone's faces and

362
00:23:22,120 --> 00:23:23,170
we've got loads of comments in the

363
00:23:23,170 --> 00:23:25,000

364
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:27,280

367

really enjoyed myself to myself musical

00:23:39,820 --> 00:23:42,400
ability or anything he's done here stick

369

Hanna will be on there in a minute to

371
00:23:46,210 --> 00:23:48,100
answer any questions you guys know how

372
00:23:48,100 --> 00:23:49,900
did you how did you came up with this

373
00:23:49,900 --> 00:23:52,420
talk I mean if your brain works as you

374
00:23:52,420 --> 00:23:55,960
say it does you but it must only take

375
00:23:55,960 --> 00:23:57,820
five minutes right or is it just a

376
00:23:57,820 --> 00:24:01,210
little while so I I hummed these songs

377
00:24:01,210 --> 00:24:04,120
already for years and my my really my my

378
00:24:04,120 --> 00:24:06,400
fellow developers I drove them insane

379
00:24:06,400 --> 00:24:17,860
you know by yeah and then I I came

380
00:24:17,860 --> 00:24:19,570
across this Stack Overflow thread there

381
00:24:19,570 --> 00:24:20,800
so there's a brilliant Stack Overflow

382
00:24:20,800 --> 00:24:23,470
thread on the most funny comments

383
00:24:23,470 --> 00:24:25,630
encountered in software code ever I

384
00:24:25,630 --> 00:24:27,400
think it's good for archiving purposes

385
00:24:27,400 --> 00:24:30,010
because it doesn't really address the

386
00:24:30,010 --> 00:24:31,660
meta stackoverflow rules if you know

387
00:24:31,660 --> 00:24:34,720
what I mean and there are a few golden

388
00:24:34,720 --> 00:24:36,220
ones up there and I immediately thought

389
00:24:36,220 --> 00:24:38,020
of songs and and well then the first

390
00:24:38,020 --> 00:24:40,870
version of the talk was for I guess just

391
00:24:40,870 --> 00:24:43,600
just for the record I'm an

392
00:24:43,600 --> 00:24:45,340
under-pressure person and not a nice

393
00:24:45,340 --> 00:24:48,040
yeah me also and the funny thing is

394
00:24:48,040 --> 00:24:50,470
while this talk existed

395
00:24:50,470 --> 00:24:51,570
a lot of colleagues of my just just

396
00:24:51,570 --> 00:24:54,700
slack or what set me new ideas for new

397
00:24:54,700 --> 00:24:57,669
song so I the work is done by my

398
00:24:57,669 --> 00:24:58,870
colleagues right now they just ha I

399
00:24:58,870 --> 00:25:00,280
listen to this song you should add it to

400
00:25:00,280 --> 00:25:02,640
your slide excel so it grows and grows

401
00:25:02,640 --> 00:25:05,530
basically if we're doing this next year

402
00:25:05,530 --> 00:25:07,990
for another another event we can have a

403
00:25:07,990 --> 00:25:10,270
version to version 3 different for

404
00:25:10,270 --> 00:25:18,490
different yeah sure yeah yeah yeah no if

405
00:25:18,490 --> 00:25:22,980

406
