1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,650
yes we've heard about a lot of great

2
00:00:01,650 --> 00:00:03,330
things today and some good knowledge has

3
00:00:03,330 --> 00:00:05,490
been shared and what we're going to do

4
00:00:05,490 --> 00:00:09,059
now is just sort of a a raw honest panel

5
00:00:09,059 --> 00:00:10,679
from people who've worked at a number of

6
00:00:10,679 --> 00:00:12,450
different companies saying hey this is

7
00:00:12,450 --> 00:00:14,580
what worked for us this is what didn't

8
00:00:14,580 --> 00:00:17,100
and we're gonna allow plenty of time for

9
00:00:17,100 --> 00:00:19,710
questions so one thing that I wanted to

10
00:00:19,710 --> 00:00:22,439
mention at the beginning is we're all

11
00:00:22,439 --> 00:00:24,210
friends we get along really well

12
00:00:24,210 --> 00:00:25,859
but we're purposefully going to try to

13
00:00:25,859 --> 00:00:27,119
find some opportunities where we

14
00:00:27,119 --> 00:00:29,640
disagree about things because I think

15
00:00:29,640 --> 00:00:31,260
that when everyone agrees it's not very

16
00:00:31,260 --> 00:00:33,180
interesting and also hopefully that will

17
00:00:33,180 --> 00:00:35,489
show us some of the edges around

18
00:00:35,489 --> 00:00:38,579
different concepts and principles you

19
00:00:38,579 --> 00:00:40,309
know how culture perhaps at a company or

20
00:00:40,309 --> 00:00:42,420
specific technologies may make something

21
00:00:42,420 --> 00:00:45,660
work in one case and not in another yeah

22
00:00:45,660 --> 00:00:48,510
so first let's just go down the line and

23
00:00:48,510 --> 00:00:51,149
have people introduce themselves so yeah

24
00:00:51,149 --> 00:00:53,940
I'm Doug de berry I'm the currently the

25
00:00:53,940 --> 00:00:56,820
director of defense at data dog data

26
00:00:56,820 --> 00:01:00,570
dogs a cloud-based SAS monitoring

27
00:01:00,570 --> 00:01:03,420
solution application traces logs host

28
00:01:03,420 --> 00:01:04,979
metrics all that sort of thing and I'm

29
00:01:04,979 --> 00:01:06,510
gonna present it to the user in a single

30
00:01:06,510 --> 00:01:08,430
plain pane of glass providing unmatched

31
00:01:08,430 --> 00:01:11,310
visibility across your entire install

32
00:01:11,310 --> 00:01:14,010
this yeah I've been with a dog for about

33
00:01:14,010 --> 00:01:15,450
three years I've done I've worn many

34
00:01:15,450 --> 00:01:17,130
hats there I was recently director of

35
00:01:17,130 --> 00:01:18,360
product security I did a lot of

36
00:01:18,360 --> 00:01:19,650
infrastructure security work there as

37
00:01:19,650 --> 00:01:21,270
well and prior to that I worked for

38
00:01:21,270 --> 00:01:23,400
various consulting firms doing kind of

39
00:01:23,400 --> 00:01:25,259
offensive security type of stuff so but

40
00:01:25,259 --> 00:01:30,659
I'm soundly in the defensive category hi

41
00:01:30,659 --> 00:01:31,079
everyone

42
00:01:31,079 --> 00:01:39,390
my name is Jesse and all I am I'm the

43
00:01:39,390 --> 00:01:41,130
chief security officer of a company

44
00:01:41,130 --> 00:01:43,890
called fleet Smith and we're basically a

45
00:01:43,890 --> 00:01:47,399
modern Apple device management SAS

46
00:01:47,399 --> 00:01:50,250
product so your if you're familiar with

47
00:01:50,250 --> 00:01:53,070
that space we're kind of a newer entry

48
00:01:53,070 --> 00:01:56,250
so the product has a bunch of things

49
00:01:56,250 --> 00:01:57,750
probably one of the coolest things we do

50
00:01:57,750 --> 00:02:00,149
is we automate the new hire device setup

51
00:02:00,149 --> 00:02:02,280
process but that's kind of just the

52
00:02:02,280 --> 00:02:03,439
coolest part

53
00:02:03,439 --> 00:02:07,189
the part that I find even cooler is

54
00:02:07,189 --> 00:02:08,598
actually the ongoing like patch

55
00:02:08,598 --> 00:02:10,008
management stuff that we completely

56
00:02:10,008 --> 00:02:12,260
automated which is very unique

57
00:02:12,260 --> 00:02:15,739
before fleet Smith I was at Dropbox as

58
00:02:15,739 --> 00:02:17,620
an infrastructure security engineer and

59
00:02:17,620 --> 00:02:22,150
did a bunch of different projects there

60
00:02:22,150 --> 00:02:23,380
monitoring

61
00:02:23,380 --> 00:02:26,690
detection log aggregation and alerting a

62
00:02:26,690 --> 00:02:29,769
bunch of stuff so that's my background

63
00:02:29,769 --> 00:02:34,340
awesome Sam Lackey just started the

64
00:02:34,340 --> 00:02:35,750
beginning I started out in security

65
00:02:35,750 --> 00:02:37,519
consulting and pentesting so was that

66
00:02:37,519 --> 00:02:40,130
ISEC partners and then NCC group for a

67
00:02:40,130 --> 00:02:43,489
long time after that got given a unique

68
00:02:43,489 --> 00:02:45,739
opportunity to go be the first see so at

69
00:02:45,739 --> 00:02:48,830
Etsy about ten years ago when there was

70
00:02:48,830 --> 00:02:51,849
FC and Netflix pioneering a lot of

71
00:02:51,849 --> 00:02:55,250
DevOps and cloud to be one the first he

72
00:02:55,250 --> 00:02:56,840
says they live through that shift to

73
00:02:56,840 --> 00:02:59,269
DevOps and cloud and build a whole

74
00:02:59,269 --> 00:03:00,620
application security infrastructure

75
00:03:00,620 --> 00:03:02,569
security security engineering groups

76
00:03:02,569 --> 00:03:05,209
around that and then took a bunch of

77
00:03:05,209 --> 00:03:07,069
those lessons learned when we needed

78
00:03:07,069 --> 00:03:09,650
kind of a more modern way to defend our

79
00:03:09,650 --> 00:03:11,510
applications and our api's and

80
00:03:11,510 --> 00:03:13,310
everything there we got very fed up with

81
00:03:13,310 --> 00:03:15,500
legacy where about firewalls and we took

82
00:03:15,500 --> 00:03:16,790
our lessons learned and turn that into

83
00:03:16,790 --> 00:03:18,709
signal Sciences which is where I am

84
00:03:18,709 --> 00:03:21,709
today which is that what the marketing

85
00:03:21,709 --> 00:03:23,510
folks would call a next-gen laughs and a

86
00:03:23,510 --> 00:03:25,730
rasp so protecting apps and protecting

87
00:03:25,730 --> 00:03:30,980
api's and I am head of credit security

88
00:03:30,980 --> 00:03:33,170
for moon Pig if there's one thing to

89
00:03:33,170 --> 00:03:34,609
take away from today it's to have that

90
00:03:34,609 --> 00:03:36,920
awful time in your head for the rest of

91
00:03:36,920 --> 00:03:39,109
this session and I'm previously

92
00:03:39,109 --> 00:03:41,239
financial services so I came from about

93
00:03:41,239 --> 00:03:47,630
five and a half years and then moved to

94
00:03:47,630 --> 00:03:49,910
a much smaller more agile environment

95
00:03:49,910 --> 00:03:52,130
which I love and I would solidly put

96
00:03:52,130 --> 00:03:55,359
myself in that blue team camp like Doug

97
00:03:55,359 --> 00:03:58,190
okay great and just lastly a little bit

98
00:03:58,190 --> 00:04:00,859
me so I'm a technical director and

99
00:04:00,859 --> 00:04:03,139
research director at NCC group we do pen

100
00:04:03,139 --> 00:04:05,569
testing of all the things web app mobile

101
00:04:05,569 --> 00:04:07,370
network as well as Hardware reviews

102
00:04:07,370 --> 00:04:10,220
crypto reviews me in particular I've

103
00:04:10,220 --> 00:04:13,340
been focusing on helping companies like

104
00:04:13,340 --> 00:04:14,940
scale their security what

105
00:04:14,940 --> 00:04:17,310
that's building like epic programs or

106
00:04:17,310 --> 00:04:19,380
integrating static analysis dynamic

107
00:04:19,380 --> 00:04:21,269
analysis I'm just trying to have like

108
00:04:21,269 --> 00:04:23,670
systematic scalable security wins so

109
00:04:23,670 --> 00:04:25,430
that's something I'm very excited about

110
00:04:25,430 --> 00:04:27,360
one thing I just wanted to quickly

111
00:04:27,360 --> 00:04:30,960
mention there's so many conferences

112
00:04:30,960 --> 00:04:32,790
these days with so many great talks it's

113
00:04:32,790 --> 00:04:34,770
sort of hard to keep up so I started a

114
00:04:34,770 --> 00:04:36,540
free newsletter it's linked at the

115
00:04:36,540 --> 00:04:39,030
bottom it's called a tldr sec but

116
00:04:39,030 --> 00:04:41,520
basically it's like once a week ish I'll

117
00:04:41,520 --> 00:04:43,920
say hey here's a cool talk detailed

118
00:04:43,920 --> 00:04:45,000
summary of it that you may not have

119
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:46,740
heard of here are some cool tools and

120
00:04:46,740 --> 00:04:48,510
things like that so if you want to check

121
00:04:48,510 --> 00:04:48,900
it out

122
00:04:48,900 --> 00:04:53,070
feel free ok great so we're gonna start

123
00:04:53,070 --> 00:04:54,930
off with some specific prompts that we

124
00:04:54,930 --> 00:04:56,580
think are useful and interesting and

125
00:04:56,580 --> 00:04:58,230
then we're going to allocate a bunch of

126
00:04:58,230 --> 00:05:00,090
time for your questions

127
00:05:00,090 --> 00:05:03,350
so start noodling about them now

128
00:05:03,350 --> 00:05:05,310
otherwise we'll just like awkwardly

129
00:05:05,310 --> 00:05:07,050
stare at you and make eye contact with

130
00:05:07,050 --> 00:05:12,300
everyone one at a time ok so one thing

131
00:05:12,300 --> 00:05:14,820
that we've heard from a couple of

132
00:05:14,820 --> 00:05:16,350
different talks today is the importance

133
00:05:16,350 --> 00:05:18,240
of security culture like how do you

134
00:05:18,240 --> 00:05:20,130
build a good security culture how do you

135
00:05:20,130 --> 00:05:22,050
get developers and management to care

136
00:05:22,050 --> 00:05:24,150
about security as well as you know sort

137
00:05:24,150 --> 00:05:25,800
of the downsides obviously of having bad

138
00:05:25,800 --> 00:05:29,100
culture so I guess one thing I'm curious

139
00:05:29,100 --> 00:05:30,900
about is can anyone provide some like

140
00:05:30,900 --> 00:05:33,300
specific actionable things that they did

141
00:05:33,300 --> 00:05:35,970
that measurably improved the security

142
00:05:35,970 --> 00:05:41,820
culture in your organization so one of

143
00:05:41,820 --> 00:05:43,940
the things that we focus on a lot is

144
00:05:43,940 --> 00:05:46,669
comes back to kind of core education and

145
00:05:46,669 --> 00:05:49,919
capturing people's interests so and I

146
00:05:49,919 --> 00:05:51,900
think that we see a lot which I imagine

147
00:05:51,900 --> 00:05:53,669
a lot of people do our phishing attempts

148
00:05:53,669 --> 00:05:57,150
people pretending to be CFO CEOs I must

149
00:05:57,150 --> 00:05:58,620
update my bank details now but don't

150
00:05:58,620 --> 00:06:01,980
call me those types of things so we do a

151
00:06:01,980 --> 00:06:04,230
lot around infographics short sweet

152
00:06:04,230 --> 00:06:06,300
pieces of data just to remind people of

153
00:06:06,300 --> 00:06:08,490
kind of key security terms they've been

154
00:06:08,490 --> 00:06:09,840
really good to kind of start to build

155
00:06:09,840 --> 00:06:11,550
those foundations up but the biggest

156
00:06:11,550 --> 00:06:12,960
piece for us is around building

157
00:06:12,960 --> 00:06:15,330
relationships with teams and not just

158
00:06:15,330 --> 00:06:17,700
engineering things but marketing teams

159
00:06:17,700 --> 00:06:20,790
HR teams and just being present so

160
00:06:20,790 --> 00:06:22,050
making sure that they know who this

161
00:06:22,050 --> 00:06:23,610
security team I that they feel like they

162
00:06:23,610 --> 00:06:26,340
can talk to us and being accessible has

163
00:06:26,340 --> 00:06:27,930
been really important and building those

164
00:06:27,930 --> 00:06:29,970
relationships up is then how test to

165
00:06:29,970 --> 00:06:32,400
start to make security just part of who

166
00:06:32,400 --> 00:06:34,139
we are and what we do rather than

167
00:06:34,139 --> 00:06:37,409
something that's at the end and so

168
00:06:37,409 --> 00:06:39,210
that's helped us to make sure that we're

169
00:06:39,210 --> 00:06:41,099
embedded within our operating principles

170
00:06:41,099 --> 00:06:42,750
for our engineering teams and within

171
00:06:42,750 --> 00:06:45,539
their objectives as well and that's

172
00:06:45,539 --> 00:06:47,490
allowed us to start to expand more and

173
00:06:47,490 --> 00:06:48,750
more and then how do we do they're kind

174
00:06:48,750 --> 00:06:51,750
of sexy or cool stuff around culture and

175
00:06:51,750 --> 00:06:53,819
innovation to increase that security

176
00:06:53,819 --> 00:06:57,870
awareness so I'm curious how how exactly

177
00:06:57,870 --> 00:06:59,520
do you you seem so you mentioned like

178
00:06:59,520 --> 00:07:01,349
building those relationships with

179
00:07:01,349 --> 00:07:02,840
various teams and like I totally agree

180
00:07:02,840 --> 00:07:06,659
so like how I guess so things I've heard

181
00:07:06,659 --> 00:07:07,979
from a number of companies is like hey

182
00:07:07,979 --> 00:07:10,020
just like grabbing lunch with different

183
00:07:10,020 --> 00:07:13,860
teams or one technique someone mentioned

184
00:07:13,860 --> 00:07:17,400
maybe as a nerd ugh like hey you just

185
00:07:17,400 --> 00:07:18,960
like show up to work with a bunch of

186
00:07:18,960 --> 00:07:21,270
cupcakes and you know invite people to

187
00:07:21,270 --> 00:07:22,979
come by the security teams desks and

188
00:07:22,979 --> 00:07:25,530
then like as they're talking like oh hey

189
00:07:25,530 --> 00:07:27,779
by the way there was this question I had

190
00:07:27,779 --> 00:07:29,219
for you and and because like you're

191
00:07:29,219 --> 00:07:31,710
nearby because they came for cupcakes so

192
00:07:31,710 --> 00:07:33,120
yeah I guess yeah oh you can't

193
00:07:33,120 --> 00:07:39,539
underestimate the power of food she's

194
00:07:39,539 --> 00:07:40,949
been a huge part of it I'd like to say

195
00:07:40,949 --> 00:07:42,750
that I'm actually quite persistent and

196
00:07:42,750 --> 00:07:45,240
making sure that I'm inclusive but not

197
00:07:45,240 --> 00:07:47,430
in a bad way so why I tried to do and

198
00:07:47,430 --> 00:07:49,110
have been really cognizant of doing I'm

199
00:07:49,110 --> 00:07:50,400
still quite early on in my journey

200
00:07:50,400 --> 00:07:51,690
Olympic I've been working with their

201
00:07:51,690 --> 00:07:54,569
parent company for about a year and one

202
00:07:54,569 --> 00:07:56,129
thing I've been really cognizant of not

203
00:07:56,129 --> 00:07:57,870
doing is creating loads of brand new

204
00:07:57,870 --> 00:07:59,460
meetings or forums that people have to

205
00:07:59,460 --> 00:08:01,409
go to as soon as I land and what I've

206
00:08:01,409 --> 00:08:03,060
been doing is going along to existing

207
00:08:03,060 --> 00:08:07,229
forums guilds and just being present and

208
00:08:07,229 --> 00:08:08,879
absorbing what they're doing interesting

209
00:08:08,879 --> 00:08:10,949
hey there's another way to do that have

210
00:08:10,949 --> 00:08:13,440
you thought about this rather than no

211
00:08:13,440 --> 00:08:16,289
and stop in so just being present

212
00:08:16,289 --> 00:08:17,789
turning up to things that they already

213
00:08:17,789 --> 00:08:19,349
do and be a part of their team and

214
00:08:19,349 --> 00:08:21,270
sometimes that means doing things that I

215
00:08:21,270 --> 00:08:22,889
would say aren't part of my core role

216
00:08:22,889 --> 00:08:26,039
but just being a an extra an extra cog

217
00:08:26,039 --> 00:08:28,229
and just being supportive has helped

218
00:08:28,229 --> 00:08:30,029
them to realize oh we can talk to - and

219
00:08:30,029 --> 00:08:31,690
she's there and but I

220
00:08:31,690 --> 00:08:33,760
you joke about cupcakes about my first

221
00:08:33,760 --> 00:08:35,919
day at man-pig I did bring on that of

222
00:08:35,919 --> 00:08:38,200
donuts and I was like I'm sure she's my

223
00:08:38,200 --> 00:08:40,120
first day come and say hi and that

224
00:08:40,120 --> 00:08:43,240
worked really well really well and she's

225
00:08:43,240 --> 00:08:45,850
my South two people Zayn's been luring

226
00:08:45,850 --> 00:08:47,320
developers to his desk for like ten

227
00:08:47,320 --> 00:08:52,690
years now two of the dumbest things that

228
00:08:52,690 --> 00:08:54,310
we did at Etsy that ended up being

229
00:08:54,310 --> 00:08:58,120
wildly successful were a big we would

230
00:08:58,120 --> 00:09:00,700
genuinely set a big bowl of candy out in

231
00:09:00,700 --> 00:09:03,310
the area that was kind of on one of the

232
00:09:03,310 --> 00:09:05,050
main engineering floors so that whatever

233
00:09:05,050 --> 00:09:07,270
engineer's would walk by folks would

234
00:09:07,270 --> 00:09:08,710
just grab some candy because it was it

235
00:09:08,710 --> 00:09:10,960
was out inevitably what that would lead

236
00:09:10,960 --> 00:09:13,150
to is folks grabbing some candy and you

237
00:09:13,150 --> 00:09:14,410
know just saying hello and everything

238
00:09:14,410 --> 00:09:17,020
and then the magic sentence would start

239
00:09:17,020 --> 00:09:19,390
which is oh hey you know bow I'm here

240
00:09:19,390 --> 00:09:21,460
actually we have a question about

241
00:09:21,460 --> 00:09:23,560
something and it that bowl of candy just

242
00:09:23,560 --> 00:09:25,600
paid for itself that was in times over

243
00:09:25,600 --> 00:09:27,460
the minute that you heard that sentence

244
00:09:27,460 --> 00:09:29,710
because it was a conversation with

245
00:09:29,710 --> 00:09:32,140
security that was otherwise in reality

246
00:09:32,140 --> 00:09:33,730
almost never going to happen

247
00:09:33,730 --> 00:09:36,700
and so incentivizing interaction with

248
00:09:36,700 --> 00:09:38,470
the security team which is a small

249
00:09:38,470 --> 00:09:40,240
subset of the overall culture question

250
00:09:40,240 --> 00:09:42,760
but the other one that we did that was

251
00:09:42,760 --> 00:09:44,470
also we kind of rolled our eyes at when

252
00:09:44,470 --> 00:09:45,610
we did it because we thought it was just

253
00:09:45,610 --> 00:09:47,830
gonna be a dumb thing and end up being

254
00:09:47,830 --> 00:09:51,190
super successful is we made different

255
00:09:51,190 --> 00:09:53,680
swag for the security team so t-shirts

256
00:09:53,680 --> 00:09:56,290
and stuff like that and we would give

257
00:09:56,290 --> 00:09:58,960
them out to anyone who came by that

258
00:09:58,960 --> 00:10:00,670
asked a question about security whether

259
00:10:00,670 --> 00:10:02,530
that was they reported a phishing email

260
00:10:02,530 --> 00:10:05,680
to us or a lead architect asking you

261
00:10:05,680 --> 00:10:07,000
know hey can you have a quick look at

262
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:08,200
the service that were actually used to

263
00:10:08,200 --> 00:10:09,250
starting to think about doing or

264
00:10:09,250 --> 00:10:11,890
anything like that and we'd give it to

265
00:10:11,890 --> 00:10:12,690
the people that asked those questions

266
00:10:12,690 --> 00:10:15,750
they would inevitably within the next

267
00:10:15,750 --> 00:10:19,480
days or a few weeks or so wear that or

268
00:10:19,480 --> 00:10:21,130
have a coffee mug or anything like that

269
00:10:21,130 --> 00:10:24,460
and their teams would then ask them like

270
00:10:24,460 --> 00:10:25,990
Oh where'd you get that shirt from Jose

271
00:10:25,990 --> 00:10:28,270
oh because the security team gave it to

272
00:10:28,270 --> 00:10:30,640
me because I asked a question and it

273
00:10:30,640 --> 00:10:33,760
would they would basically do 90% of the

274
00:10:33,760 --> 00:10:36,940
branding and cultural awareness work for

275
00:10:36,940 --> 00:10:37,810
us in that

276
00:10:37,810 --> 00:10:40,330
internally because then we'd get a bunch

277
00:10:40,330 --> 00:10:41,620
of folks who think oh well I want a

278
00:10:41,620 --> 00:10:43,600
coffee mug or a t-shirt or they just

279
00:10:43,600 --> 00:10:45,070
can't either anyway so I got nothing to

280
00:10:45,070 --> 00:10:47,830
lose and go engage with the security

281
00:10:47,830 --> 00:10:50,320
team and it was really we started to

282
00:10:50,320 --> 00:10:52,990
think about the interaction piece of

283
00:10:52,990 --> 00:10:55,420
culture in the sense of your if you're

284
00:10:55,420 --> 00:10:56,980
building a security team or scaling a

285
00:10:56,980 --> 00:10:58,510
security team or anything there you're

286
00:10:58,510 --> 00:11:00,070
basically running a company inside a

287
00:11:00,070 --> 00:11:01,180
company and you need to be thinking

288
00:11:01,180 --> 00:11:02,860
about how are you doing marketing and

289
00:11:02,860 --> 00:11:04,810
outreach to what are your customers

290
00:11:04,810 --> 00:11:06,850
which is the rest of the business yeah

291
00:11:06,850 --> 00:11:08,529
and I totally agree that did a very

292
00:11:08,529 --> 00:11:10,360
similar thing a dead dog I branded the

293
00:11:10,360 --> 00:11:12,279
team right like I had a logo made up and

294
00:11:12,279 --> 00:11:14,110
worked with our design team to do we did

295
00:11:14,110 --> 00:11:16,120
koozies we did two kinds of stickers we

296
00:11:16,120 --> 00:11:18,130
did t-shirts and you know people love it

297
00:11:18,130 --> 00:11:20,410
went over great you know it's and it

298
00:11:20,410 --> 00:11:23,170
started more as a thing with I used to

299
00:11:23,170 --> 00:11:24,970
work at Yahoo in you know their security

300
00:11:24,970 --> 00:11:26,950
team was branded the paranoids and it

301
00:11:26,950 --> 00:11:28,660
was it was really helpful to have that

302
00:11:28,660 --> 00:11:30,580
like brand especially at a company that

303
00:11:30,580 --> 00:11:32,500
was so large and so widespread but um

304
00:11:32,500 --> 00:11:34,000
you know I kinda just took that in that

305
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:36,070
way like every everything that you send

306
00:11:36,070 --> 00:11:37,750
out or every like presentation you make

307
00:11:37,750 --> 00:11:39,430
internally you have you have your logo

308
00:11:39,430 --> 00:11:40,810
you have your brand we have a bunch of

309
00:11:40,810 --> 00:11:44,410
like slack emojis for safety bits bits

310
00:11:44,410 --> 00:11:47,260
the data dog mascot and we took safety

311
00:11:47,260 --> 00:11:49,240
bits and put them within a like a life

312
00:11:49,240 --> 00:11:50,890
guard life-saving ring and that kind of

313
00:11:50,890 --> 00:11:52,300
you know show that we're the Life Guards

314
00:11:52,300 --> 00:11:54,220
we're here to you know have fun but you

315
00:11:54,220 --> 00:11:55,360
know help you when you're when you're

316
00:11:55,360 --> 00:11:57,820
when you're drowning sort of thing and

317
00:11:57,820 --> 00:11:58,630
the other thing that worked really well

318
00:11:58,630 --> 00:12:00,970
for us too is embedding engineers

319
00:12:00,970 --> 00:12:02,980
embedding security engineers with

320
00:12:02,980 --> 00:12:06,310
development teams and so like the roles

321
00:12:06,310 --> 00:12:07,930
and like the time period is it was

322
00:12:07,930 --> 00:12:11,790
varied we did a couple things we're at a

323
00:12:11,790 --> 00:12:13,810
someone who I used to work with that

324
00:12:13,810 --> 00:12:15,970
ISEC partners when he came on board and

325
00:12:15,970 --> 00:12:17,980
I just put him directly right with our

326
00:12:17,980 --> 00:12:20,140
web development team and he just got to

327
00:12:20,140 --> 00:12:21,820
know everybody on the team he sat with

328
00:12:21,820 --> 00:12:23,740
them and and even if they didn't ask him

329
00:12:23,740 --> 00:12:24,820
any questions on that day or whatever

330
00:12:24,820 --> 00:12:26,170
but every time they walked into work

331
00:12:26,170 --> 00:12:28,209
they'd walk right by boutique's desk and

332
00:12:28,209 --> 00:12:29,950
and and you know they would know like oh

333
00:12:29,950 --> 00:12:31,450
there's a security guy I know who to go

334
00:12:31,450 --> 00:12:33,970
to if I have any any problems we've also

335
00:12:33,970 --> 00:12:35,470
done like temporary things where we

336
00:12:35,470 --> 00:12:37,270
would just embed someone for a period of

337
00:12:37,270 --> 00:12:38,709
like two weeks or a month and they would

338
00:12:38,709 --> 00:12:40,270
just go and either fix a few security

339
00:12:40,270 --> 00:12:42,310
bugs for them or just like work on a

340
00:12:42,310 --> 00:12:44,140
particular like thorny situation but

341
00:12:44,140 --> 00:12:45,580
just like being there being visible

342
00:12:45,580 --> 00:12:47,170
being aware and then they create

343
00:12:47,170 --> 00:12:48,210
relationships with those

344
00:12:48,210 --> 00:12:49,500
oops and now you've got that kind of

345
00:12:49,500 --> 00:12:52,560
bond for her life so to speak so though

346
00:12:52,560 --> 00:12:53,940
some things that were successful for us

347
00:12:53,940 --> 00:12:59,190
I have a an interesting one I your

348
00:12:59,190 --> 00:13:00,839
comment actually about the the donuts

349
00:13:00,839 --> 00:13:03,210
reminded me of this oddly enough because

350
00:13:03,210 --> 00:13:05,130
I think what's so powerful about that is

351
00:13:05,130 --> 00:13:07,170
that it was a very foundational kind of

352
00:13:07,170 --> 00:13:10,680
first impression moment and I guess on a

353
00:13:10,680 --> 00:13:14,010
similar note I think security onboarding

354
00:13:14,010 --> 00:13:16,620
is a kind of overlooked place where you

355
00:13:16,620 --> 00:13:18,450
can really set the tone and foundation

356
00:13:18,450 --> 00:13:20,820
for that relationship between every

357
00:13:20,820 --> 00:13:22,290
employee that gets hired at the company

358
00:13:22,290 --> 00:13:25,410
and the security org and I think that's

359
00:13:25,410 --> 00:13:27,630
probably the most important thing that

360
00:13:27,630 --> 00:13:29,580
should be in a security onboarding

361
00:13:29,580 --> 00:13:31,770
rather than like I mean yes of course

362
00:13:31,770 --> 00:13:33,120
cover the phishing attacks and all that

363
00:13:33,120 --> 00:13:35,399
stuff but like culturally that's so

364
00:13:35,399 --> 00:13:37,560
powerful if if you reset people's

365
00:13:37,560 --> 00:13:39,450
expectations because oftentimes people

366
00:13:39,450 --> 00:13:42,330
come into a company and they've had some

367
00:13:42,330 --> 00:13:43,890
negative experiences in their past with

368
00:13:43,890 --> 00:13:45,959
other security orcs that have maybe a

369
00:13:45,959 --> 00:13:49,529
more toxic kind of culture and so

370
00:13:49,529 --> 00:13:51,810
telling them hey look the way that we

371
00:13:51,810 --> 00:13:55,230
view our role at this company is to help

372
00:13:55,230 --> 00:13:58,020
you achieve your business goals and

373
00:13:58,020 --> 00:13:59,910
accelerate your work and not be a

374
00:13:59,910 --> 00:14:04,500
blocker people are like with what and

375
00:14:04,500 --> 00:14:06,270
then if you follow through on that and

376
00:14:06,270 --> 00:14:08,209
you actually do you know help people

377
00:14:08,209 --> 00:14:10,940
with their architecture decisions with

378
00:14:10,940 --> 00:14:14,040
code reviews whatever it may be they

379
00:14:14,040 --> 00:14:16,589
will that trust will be built up and

380
00:14:16,589 --> 00:14:19,740
it'll just really snowball in a positive

381
00:14:19,740 --> 00:14:22,290
way over time so that's that's what

382
00:14:22,290 --> 00:14:24,750
we've done yeah actually

383
00:14:24,750 --> 00:14:26,610
along those lines I've heard from a

384
00:14:26,610 --> 00:14:28,230
couple of other companies sort of the

385
00:14:28,230 --> 00:14:32,010
dual value of like onboarding and it's

386
00:14:32,010 --> 00:14:33,390
like yeah here's some security things

387
00:14:33,390 --> 00:14:36,839
but also setting the tone and also just

388
00:14:36,839 --> 00:14:39,750
like here here's our faces we're your

389
00:14:39,750 --> 00:14:41,910
friends like when you have security

390
00:14:41,910 --> 00:14:43,560
questions like here's who you can come

391
00:14:43,560 --> 00:14:45,540
to and it's sort of like rather than

392
00:14:45,540 --> 00:14:48,149
this like abstract like scary Security

393
00:14:48,149 --> 00:14:50,760
org it's like oh like I know Josie or

394
00:14:50,760 --> 00:14:52,620
Alex or whatever yeah like they gave my

395
00:14:52,620 --> 00:14:53,850
onboarding thing and they were super - I

396
00:14:53,850 --> 00:14:56,070
should go chat with them and also saying

397
00:14:56,070 --> 00:14:58,290
explicitly like we will never make you

398
00:14:58,290 --> 00:14:58,710
feel

399
00:14:58,710 --> 00:15:00,390
if you ask us a question about security

400
00:15:00,390 --> 00:15:01,980
we will thank you a hundred percent

401
00:15:01,980 --> 00:15:04,410
literally every single time there's no

402
00:15:04,410 --> 00:15:06,020
such thing as a dumb security question

403
00:15:06,020 --> 00:15:08,700
yeah definitely and then just like

404
00:15:08,700 --> 00:15:10,440
finally some other things that I've

405
00:15:10,440 --> 00:15:13,649
heard running internal CTFs like

406
00:15:13,649 --> 00:15:15,120
especially if you can choose a

407
00:15:15,120 --> 00:15:17,070
vulnerable application that uses like

408
00:15:17,070 --> 00:15:18,510
the same tech stack so if you're using

409
00:15:18,510 --> 00:15:20,700
like a node.js application use like node

410
00:15:20,700 --> 00:15:22,529
goat or if you can even build like a

411
00:15:22,529 --> 00:15:25,140
mini CTF that uses some of the same like

412
00:15:25,140 --> 00:15:27,209
company's specific frameworks that you

413
00:15:27,209 --> 00:15:29,700
use and use maybe a pen test or bug

414
00:15:29,700 --> 00:15:32,190
bounty examples to say like oh look for

415
00:15:32,190 --> 00:15:34,230
bugs in this application by the way it's

416
00:15:34,230 --> 00:15:36,180
almost exactly like ours and it's even

417
00:15:36,180 --> 00:15:37,580
based on bugs we've had in the past

418
00:15:37,580 --> 00:15:39,660
developers tend to love that it's a bit

419
00:15:39,660 --> 00:15:41,430
more work but I think the ROI can be

420
00:15:41,430 --> 00:15:45,120
super high another company has this is

421
00:15:45,120 --> 00:15:48,060
segment has an internal leader board for

422
00:15:48,060 --> 00:15:50,640
security where basically they can dole

423
00:15:50,640 --> 00:15:52,649
out points where like hey you

424
00:15:52,649 --> 00:15:55,770
proactively found a bug or you fixed it

425
00:15:55,770 --> 00:15:57,779
or you really went above and beyond

426
00:15:57,779 --> 00:16:00,330
building secure by defaults into this

427
00:16:00,330 --> 00:16:02,550
new micro service or something and

428
00:16:02,550 --> 00:16:04,650
basically anyone in the company can see

429
00:16:04,650 --> 00:16:06,440
like where their ranking is

430
00:16:06,440 --> 00:16:09,000
participating in the CTF gives you some

431
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:11,940
points and I think the CTO or one of the

432
00:16:11,940 --> 00:16:13,980
senior leadership is very active in it

433
00:16:13,980 --> 00:16:16,020
and so there's like some competition

434
00:16:16,020 --> 00:16:18,029
between senior people and there's just a

435
00:16:18,029 --> 00:16:20,970
lot of like seen senior leadership

436
00:16:20,970 --> 00:16:22,950
really buy into it is very powerful as

437
00:16:22,950 --> 00:16:27,120
well so cool so I think something a

438
00:16:27,120 --> 00:16:30,690
couple of talks I mentioned today is the

439
00:16:30,690 --> 00:16:33,180
competing priorities of security and

440
00:16:33,180 --> 00:16:35,400
developers right so security wants

441
00:16:35,400 --> 00:16:36,930
things to be safe developers obviously

442
00:16:36,930 --> 00:16:38,610
need to get new features to market to

443
00:16:38,610 --> 00:16:39,959
hit business goals and business

444
00:16:39,959 --> 00:16:41,339
requirements and there's there can be

445
00:16:41,339 --> 00:16:45,000
some differences in incentives there and

446
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:46,980
I think like we often think about like

447
00:16:46,980 --> 00:16:51,150
metrics and KPIs or okay ours or

448
00:16:51,150 --> 00:16:52,500
objectives and key results and things

449
00:16:52,500 --> 00:16:54,540
like that so in terms of security

450
00:16:54,540 --> 00:16:57,810
metrics I'm curious like what are some

451
00:16:57,810 --> 00:17:00,899
good ones and what are some bad ones cuz

452
00:17:00,899 --> 00:17:03,260
I think it's

453
00:17:06,059 --> 00:17:09,400
so I working across a few different

454
00:17:09,400 --> 00:17:11,920
companies and working quite closely with

455
00:17:11,920 --> 00:17:14,079
like London has got a great security

456
00:17:14,079 --> 00:17:17,439
community and if you're not engaged I'd

457
00:17:17,439 --> 00:17:19,150
encourage you to engage with your your

458
00:17:19,150 --> 00:17:20,829
peers because there's a lot of knowledge

459
00:17:20,829 --> 00:17:22,359
sharing that happens and so that you get

460
00:17:22,359 --> 00:17:23,740
to kind of hear what some people doing

461
00:17:23,740 --> 00:17:24,609
for their metrics and it's really

462
00:17:24,609 --> 00:17:25,179
interesting

463
00:17:25,179 --> 00:17:27,910
my pet peeve is people that want a

464
00:17:27,910 --> 00:17:31,390
report on the number of bugs found and

465
00:17:31,390 --> 00:17:33,340
when I say hey we found zero

466
00:17:33,340 --> 00:17:35,530
vulnerabilities this week that's amazing

467
00:17:35,530 --> 00:17:37,540
because it encourages the wrong behavior

468
00:17:37,540 --> 00:17:40,090
right like you don't report or you you

469
00:17:40,090 --> 00:17:42,730
wait until the next week or you over

470
00:17:42,730 --> 00:17:44,740
report whatever it is and what happens

471
00:17:44,740 --> 00:17:46,210
is what they don't report on which i

472
00:17:46,210 --> 00:17:47,710
think is probably more powerful it's

473
00:17:47,710 --> 00:17:52,030
time to fix or like the engagement that

474
00:17:52,030 --> 00:17:54,280
we have of engineering teams and a thing

475
00:17:54,280 --> 00:17:55,630
that I think is really easy for us to

476
00:17:55,630 --> 00:17:57,490
forget is security people is that if

477
00:17:57,490 --> 00:17:59,380
your company doesn't make money then you

478
00:17:59,380 --> 00:18:06,309
won't have a job and so ultimately the

479
00:18:06,309 --> 00:18:08,860
bottom line is that you do have a common

480
00:18:08,860 --> 00:18:10,870
goal it's just that your customer is

481
00:18:10,870 --> 00:18:12,309
your engineering teams and their

482
00:18:12,309 --> 00:18:15,549
customer is being customer but that

483
00:18:15,549 --> 00:18:17,650
means that you have to work together but

484
00:18:17,650 --> 00:18:20,080
it's so important and people kind of

485
00:18:20,080 --> 00:18:21,910
push this whole having you know security

486
00:18:21,910 --> 00:18:23,860
and the main engineer objectives and I

487
00:18:23,860 --> 00:18:25,750
get that but what you don't want to do

488
00:18:25,750 --> 00:18:27,669
is start saying okay well we're gonna

489
00:18:27,669 --> 00:18:30,280
reward you if you report 50 bugs this

490
00:18:30,280 --> 00:18:31,630
week or whatever because that just

491
00:18:31,630 --> 00:18:34,059
drives me mental when actually it should

492
00:18:34,059 --> 00:18:36,880
be about how quick are we to fix it or

493
00:18:36,880 --> 00:18:39,720
are we fixing the right things and I

494
00:18:39,720 --> 00:18:41,890
really should be fixed universities

495
00:18:41,890 --> 00:18:43,929
actually is it the right thing to accept

496
00:18:43,929 --> 00:18:46,540
something or to have a conversation

497
00:18:46,540 --> 00:18:51,460
around prioritization yeah I'll jump in

498
00:18:51,460 --> 00:18:53,200
on that too that I I'm with you that I

499
00:18:53,200 --> 00:18:57,000
could talk for hours on this one alone

500
00:18:57,390 --> 00:19:00,910
could not agree more on the I think one

501
00:19:00,910 --> 00:19:02,530
of the single worst metrics that we kind

502
00:19:02,530 --> 00:19:03,940
of came up with as an industry is bug

503
00:19:03,940 --> 00:19:06,130
count I think it will lie to you every

504
00:19:06,130 --> 00:19:08,350
time because you don't know if you're

505
00:19:08,350 --> 00:19:09,700
getting better at bug discovery you

506
00:19:09,700 --> 00:19:10,500
don't know if axe

507
00:19:10,500 --> 00:19:12,659
Cam's going down as new technologies are

508
00:19:12,659 --> 00:19:14,460
coming in are you missing whole phone

509
00:19:14,460 --> 00:19:16,020
classes are you actually detecting new

510
00:19:16,020 --> 00:19:17,940
Volm classes like it will just that

511
00:19:17,940 --> 00:19:20,850
metric will lie to you every time we did

512
00:19:20,850 --> 00:19:22,740
a bunch of experimentation on different

513
00:19:22,740 --> 00:19:24,780
metrics and we there's always gonna be

514
00:19:24,780 --> 00:19:25,740
ones that are unique to your business

515
00:19:25,740 --> 00:19:28,350
but ones that we netted out on as being

516
00:19:28,350 --> 00:19:32,039
very useful across not only a big chunk

517
00:19:32,039 --> 00:19:35,309
of speaking Etsy in particular across a

518
00:19:35,309 --> 00:19:36,659
big chunk of Etsy but then across all

519
00:19:36,659 --> 00:19:37,919
different kind of business units and

520
00:19:37,919 --> 00:19:40,260
acquisitions as well would be certainly

521
00:19:40,260 --> 00:19:43,260
time to remediation is one another one

522
00:19:43,260 --> 00:19:46,020
that was very useful for us was actually

523
00:19:46,020 --> 00:19:48,990
just average engagement like just

524
00:19:48,990 --> 00:19:50,580
tracking engagement from the particular

525
00:19:50,580 --> 00:19:53,789
teams how often do different product

526
00:19:53,789 --> 00:19:54,870
teams or devops

527
00:19:54,870 --> 00:19:57,330
teams proactively engage with security

528
00:19:57,330 --> 00:19:58,919
because you'll notice once you start

529
00:19:58,919 --> 00:20:00,929
tracking that a whole bunch of those

530
00:20:00,929 --> 00:20:02,880
teams are at a zero and so those are

531
00:20:02,880 --> 00:20:04,620
your ones to go work on of getting their

532
00:20:04,620 --> 00:20:08,159
engagement higher the other ones that we

533
00:20:08,159 --> 00:20:12,230
did there's two more one other one was

534
00:20:12,230 --> 00:20:15,510
this one gets a bit fuzzy at a high

535
00:20:15,510 --> 00:20:17,970
level but basically time to detect or a

536
00:20:17,970 --> 00:20:19,880
likelihood of detection for a given

537
00:20:19,880 --> 00:20:23,309
vulnerability for exploitation of that

538
00:20:23,309 --> 00:20:25,350
so if it was a sequel injection how

539
00:20:25,350 --> 00:20:27,299
likely were we to detect that sequel

540
00:20:27,299 --> 00:20:30,000
injection in the API that it was in of

541
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:31,470
someone actually exploiting it and

542
00:20:31,470 --> 00:20:33,419
that's usually a very low number at

543
00:20:33,419 --> 00:20:37,110
first and then finally how quickly what

544
00:20:37,110 --> 00:20:39,210
do you mean by how likely how do you

545
00:20:39,210 --> 00:20:41,309
measure how likely yeah it gets really

546
00:20:41,309 --> 00:20:43,169
fuzzy I realize I tossed that one out

547
00:20:43,169 --> 00:20:45,650
there and that's never long talk it up

548
00:20:45,650 --> 00:20:49,919
yeah you can confess the our version at

549
00:20:49,919 --> 00:20:52,950
the party but yeah or two-sentence yeah

550
00:20:52,950 --> 00:20:55,020
it's it's usually when you start with

551
00:20:55,020 --> 00:20:57,210
its kind of binary of would we have been

552
00:20:57,210 --> 00:21:01,080
able to detect this in logs or in any

553
00:21:01,080 --> 00:21:03,480
other system that we had and then was

554
00:21:03,480 --> 00:21:05,010
there anything actually proactively

555
00:21:05,010 --> 00:21:06,780
alerting off of that so usually the

556
00:21:06,780 --> 00:21:10,890
answer is no and very much know when you

557
00:21:10,890 --> 00:21:12,990
and then you start to actually build up

558
00:21:12,990 --> 00:21:17,340
from there again outlawing just that one

559
00:21:17,340 --> 00:21:21,630
so I'll be at the final one was just

560
00:21:21,630 --> 00:21:23,669
number of times you say no just to wrap

561
00:21:23,669 --> 00:21:26,820
it up so like track how often you try to

562
00:21:26,820 --> 00:21:28,380
block something or say no as a security

563
00:21:28,380 --> 00:21:29,850
organization and you want that to trend

564
00:21:29,850 --> 00:21:35,490
down over time a bunch give myself two

565
00:21:35,490 --> 00:21:37,590
foot stomps a year yeah and I would save

566
00:21:37,590 --> 00:21:45,299
them all for WordPress we've been

567
00:21:45,299 --> 00:21:47,279
starting to think about is when we do

568
00:21:47,279 --> 00:21:49,440
detect it how and I'm sorry to use the

569
00:21:49,440 --> 00:21:50,940
phrase shifting list for like how far

570
00:21:50,940 --> 00:21:52,740
right where we when we detected it and

571
00:21:52,740 --> 00:21:54,630
actually should we have detected it

572
00:21:54,630 --> 00:21:56,370
earlier and then kind of bring it in

573
00:21:56,370 --> 00:21:58,889
your likelihood which is could we have

574
00:21:58,889 --> 00:22:01,139
detected it earlier and if so how would

575
00:22:01,139 --> 00:22:02,519
we have done that and that's something

576
00:22:02,519 --> 00:22:03,779
that's been really interesting to

577
00:22:03,779 --> 00:22:07,350
explore as well I want to take it back

578
00:22:07,350 --> 00:22:09,240
to rob bug count and tell you why you're

579
00:22:09,240 --> 00:22:16,289
both wrong a lot of it so I do agree

580
00:22:16,289 --> 00:22:18,450
that that like Rob bug count is you're

581
00:22:18,450 --> 00:22:20,250
both actually exactly right on that it

582
00:22:20,250 --> 00:22:21,570
does like kind of incentivize the wrong

583
00:22:21,570 --> 00:22:23,370
things but I do think that you can glean

584
00:22:23,370 --> 00:22:26,669
signal from types of bugs and where

585
00:22:26,669 --> 00:22:29,039
those bugs are found and like categories

586
00:22:29,039 --> 00:22:31,950
and severity and stuff like that so part

587
00:22:31,950 --> 00:22:34,409
of so I did read team work at Yahoo and

588
00:22:34,409 --> 00:22:36,120
I also ran the bug bounty program at

589
00:22:36,120 --> 00:22:37,590
Yahoo and one of the things that I that

590
00:22:37,590 --> 00:22:38,880
I did was collect all the metrics that

591
00:22:38,880 --> 00:22:40,740
we had and kind of like combine the bug

592
00:22:40,740 --> 00:22:42,929
bounty metrics with the JIRA ticket

593
00:22:42,929 --> 00:22:44,309
metrics and kind of like smash them all

594
00:22:44,309 --> 00:22:45,330
together and from there I could

595
00:22:45,330 --> 00:22:47,700
determine how many bugs and what type of

596
00:22:47,700 --> 00:22:49,320
bugs were being reported on what

597
00:22:49,320 --> 00:22:51,120
property he's like yeah like how much

598
00:22:51,120 --> 00:22:53,000
did Yahoo Mail cost us last quarter

599
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:55,409
right and so like you can look at all

600
00:22:55,409 --> 00:22:57,179
those types of they're great guys over

601
00:22:57,179 --> 00:23:02,100
there but you can look at that you can

602
00:23:02,100 --> 00:23:03,779
look at the types of bugs and where

603
00:23:03,779 --> 00:23:05,700
they're occurring and then target those

604
00:23:05,700 --> 00:23:07,980
areas you know the awful lot of XSS over

605
00:23:07,980 --> 00:23:09,240
here why is that oh well they're not

606
00:23:09,240 --> 00:23:11,370
using a framework or they could be doing

607
00:23:11,370 --> 00:23:12,870
it wrong or there's a new developer that

608
00:23:12,870 --> 00:23:14,159
came in they might need some more

609
00:23:14,159 --> 00:23:15,600
targeted education or something like

610
00:23:15,600 --> 00:23:17,150
that so

611
00:23:17,150 --> 00:23:19,430
I agree that like robber count is bad

612
00:23:19,430 --> 00:23:21,200
but I think you can still gain some

613
00:23:21,200 --> 00:23:23,360
signal from it to help you at least at

614
00:23:23,360 --> 00:23:29,180
least in the very beginning yeah going

615
00:23:29,180 --> 00:23:31,700
off but count so there was actually a

616
00:23:31,700 --> 00:23:34,700
neat talk from our Katie a security

617
00:23:34,700 --> 00:23:36,770
engineer at Airbnb one or two years ago

618
00:23:36,770 --> 00:23:38,960
at b-sides SF it's called a data-driven

619
00:23:38,960 --> 00:23:42,020
bug bounty and but I think it applies to

620
00:23:42,020 --> 00:23:44,030
any bug regardless of how you find it

621
00:23:44,030 --> 00:23:46,040
and and the idea is basically if you

622
00:23:46,040 --> 00:23:49,520
keep track of say you keep track of

623
00:23:49,520 --> 00:23:51,710
security bugs in JIRA you give it like a

624
00:23:51,710 --> 00:23:54,140
security label and also you say like

625
00:23:54,140 --> 00:23:55,730
what type of vulnerability is this is

626
00:23:55,730 --> 00:23:57,590
this like access control XSS and so

627
00:23:57,590 --> 00:24:01,190
forth how was it found you know did he

628
00:24:01,190 --> 00:24:03,290
find it via SAS tasked bug bounty

629
00:24:03,290 --> 00:24:05,680
pentest how severe is it is this like a

630
00:24:05,680 --> 00:24:08,150
critical issue versus like low severity

631
00:24:08,150 --> 00:24:10,640
and a couple of other different sort of

632
00:24:10,640 --> 00:24:12,770
like meta attributes maybe like how it

633
00:24:12,770 --> 00:24:14,090
was fixed or the root cause things like

634
00:24:14,090 --> 00:24:16,730
that and once you do that systematically

635
00:24:16,730 --> 00:24:19,280
over say six months or a year or two

636
00:24:19,280 --> 00:24:21,910
years you can start saying like hey

637
00:24:21,910 --> 00:24:24,730
every critical issue we found has been

638
00:24:24,730 --> 00:24:27,470
through this one tool or through pen

639
00:24:27,470 --> 00:24:29,420
testing so like maybe we double down on

640
00:24:29,420 --> 00:24:31,610
that versus we're spending you know 100

641
00:24:31,610 --> 00:24:33,560
grand this every year for this tool

642
00:24:33,560 --> 00:24:36,050
that's found like one low like why are

643
00:24:36,050 --> 00:24:38,600
we doing that or maybe just having a

644
00:24:38,600 --> 00:24:40,310
security engineer do like a manual code

645
00:24:40,310 --> 00:24:42,080
audit of our most critical services has

646
00:24:42,080 --> 00:24:45,320
given us a huge more ROI or if you're

647
00:24:45,320 --> 00:24:47,110
okay we you systemically have XSS in

648
00:24:47,110 --> 00:24:50,510
these like for micro services well what

649
00:24:50,510 --> 00:24:52,130
languages did they use oh they're all

650
00:24:52,130 --> 00:24:53,450
using the same ole and maybe let's build

651
00:24:53,450 --> 00:24:55,580
like a secure wrapper library to sort of

652
00:24:55,580 --> 00:24:57,020
systematically kill this class of bugs

653
00:24:57,020 --> 00:25:00,470
so I totally agree measuring only bugs

654
00:25:00,470 --> 00:25:02,780
like my counts can incentivize the wrong

655
00:25:02,780 --> 00:25:04,880
behavior but if you keep track of

656
00:25:04,880 --> 00:25:06,410
various meta information about it it

657
00:25:06,410 --> 00:25:08,840
lets you make data-driven decisions

658
00:25:08,840 --> 00:25:12,080
which then allows you to prove to

659
00:25:12,080 --> 00:25:14,870
yourself as well as management we're

660
00:25:14,870 --> 00:25:16,340
spending our time on things that are

661
00:25:16,340 --> 00:25:17,690
impactful and to make a difference

662
00:25:17,690 --> 00:25:19,070
because you're measuring things so you

663
00:25:19,070 --> 00:25:20,660
can say oh we just spent a quarter

664
00:25:20,660 --> 00:25:23,210
making this better and look we like

665
00:25:23,210 --> 00:25:24,560
don't have this issue anymore or it's

666
00:25:24,560 --> 00:25:26,540
like 30 percent less rather than like

667
00:25:26,540 --> 00:25:28,410
trying to do 100 things and then be like

668
00:25:28,410 --> 00:25:31,010
I kind of feel better maybe I don't know

669
00:25:31,010 --> 00:25:33,750
so yeah good for you good for management

670
00:25:33,750 --> 00:25:37,950
- yeah I think I think well it could be

671
00:25:37,950 --> 00:25:40,320
really interesting just kind of

672
00:25:40,320 --> 00:25:42,420
following that train of thought where

673
00:25:42,420 --> 00:25:43,860
you would track you know the different

674
00:25:43,860 --> 00:25:46,740
categories that you find from bug

675
00:25:46,740 --> 00:25:47,940
management has all these different

676
00:25:47,940 --> 00:25:51,330
sources would be the two then kind of go

677
00:25:51,330 --> 00:25:53,820
back and reevaluate your design phase

678
00:25:53,820 --> 00:25:55,200
decisions that you actually made

679
00:25:55,200 --> 00:25:57,660
originally because those tend to just be

680
00:25:57,660 --> 00:25:59,400
made one time and then never ever

681
00:25:59,400 --> 00:26:02,850
revisit it and then you can just end up

682
00:26:02,850 --> 00:26:04,500
doing whack-a-mole fixing all these bugs

683
00:26:04,500 --> 00:26:06,630
that would have been solved if you just

684
00:26:06,630 --> 00:26:10,200
kind of you know redesign the surface

685
00:26:10,200 --> 00:26:12,650
right but I don't necessarily mean like

686
00:26:12,650 --> 00:26:15,990
it's a thoughtful refactor right like go

687
00:26:15,990 --> 00:26:18,750
back to the design phase and and and do

688
00:26:18,750 --> 00:26:21,120
it again I don't think that's I haven't

689
00:26:21,120 --> 00:26:24,870
really seen that as a model anywhere and

690
00:26:24,870 --> 00:26:26,190
like learn from it for the future or

691
00:26:26,190 --> 00:26:27,930
actually like try to redesign that sort

692
00:26:27,930 --> 00:26:29,040
of like actually try to design it and

693
00:26:29,040 --> 00:26:30,390
then maybe you know if you want to be

694
00:26:30,390 --> 00:26:31,860
really data-driven like maybe set some

695
00:26:31,860 --> 00:26:33,330
thresholds where you say if we start

696
00:26:33,330 --> 00:26:37,380
seeing you know a number of critical

697
00:26:37,380 --> 00:26:40,050
bugs from this from any category that

698
00:26:40,050 --> 00:26:42,360
should trigger a re review of the design

699
00:26:42,360 --> 00:26:44,610
right or something like that do you

700
00:26:44,610 --> 00:26:48,360
worry that they would specifically hide

701
00:26:48,360 --> 00:26:52,560
or maybe not hide but omit information

702
00:26:52,560 --> 00:26:53,970
it might need to finding critical bugs

703
00:26:53,970 --> 00:26:56,420
so they don't have to go for a redesign

704
00:26:56,420 --> 00:27:01,410
maybe but I think I think if you frame

705
00:27:01,410 --> 00:27:03,720
it like hey do you like your Sprint's

706
00:27:03,720 --> 00:27:05,220
being interrupted fixing like two or

707
00:27:05,220 --> 00:27:07,320
three bugs all you know every day every

708
00:27:07,320 --> 00:27:08,850
two or three sprints or would you rather

709
00:27:08,850 --> 00:27:10,440
like just fix this once and then never

710
00:27:10,440 --> 00:27:12,270
have to deal with it again I think that

711
00:27:12,270 --> 00:27:16,190
might help with that you know issue

712
00:27:16,190 --> 00:27:21,030
maybe yeah I like that idea a lot I

713
00:27:21,030 --> 00:27:23,430
guess to continue at one last little bit

714
00:27:23,430 --> 00:27:24,810
of time so let's say you have some

715
00:27:24,810 --> 00:27:26,760
systemic trends in terms of this

716
00:27:26,760 --> 00:27:28,440
vulnerability class or maybe all your

717
00:27:28,440 --> 00:27:30,300
bugs are in this and all your job

718
00:27:30,300 --> 00:27:32,010
applications where your Ruby ones are

719
00:27:32,010 --> 00:27:33,110
fine or something like that

720
00:27:33,110 --> 00:27:35,270
one thing that

721
00:27:35,270 --> 00:27:37,400
so we've done projects like this with a

722
00:27:37,400 --> 00:27:38,480
couple of companies that's why I'm

723
00:27:38,480 --> 00:27:41,809
talking about it is basically yeah like

724
00:27:41,809 --> 00:27:43,610
looking at a specific vulnerability

725
00:27:43,610 --> 00:27:45,530
class or type of things and think like

726
00:27:45,530 --> 00:27:47,750
how can we either prevent this

727
00:27:47,750 --> 00:27:50,420
categorically or how can we build

728
00:27:50,420 --> 00:27:53,360
tooling to detect it either in the

729
00:27:53,360 --> 00:27:55,040
source code or in a running system or

730
00:27:55,040 --> 00:27:58,820
via monitoring and logs like

731
00:27:58,820 --> 00:28:00,590
systematically like so how can we either

732
00:28:00,590 --> 00:28:03,500
crush this prevent it from happening or

733
00:28:03,500 --> 00:28:05,720
like find them with high signal and low

734
00:28:05,720 --> 00:28:08,090
noise ideally right because triaging is

735
00:28:08,090 --> 00:28:10,610
obviously requires precious abstract

736
00:28:10,610 --> 00:28:13,400
time okay so we're gonna do like one

737
00:28:13,400 --> 00:28:16,910
more prompt so if you don't have

738
00:28:16,910 --> 00:28:20,540
questions yet please do otherwise we'll

739
00:28:20,540 --> 00:28:23,420
just all sit in silence and ponder the

740
00:28:23,420 --> 00:28:27,200
meaning of life so speaking of not

741
00:28:27,200 --> 00:28:29,600
having enough time I think one thing all

742
00:28:29,600 --> 00:28:32,150
of us probably have in common is that we

743
00:28:32,150 --> 00:28:33,590
have not enough people of not enough

744
00:28:33,590 --> 00:28:35,360
time and probably not enough budget so

745
00:28:35,360 --> 00:28:38,240
there's near infinite things you could

746
00:28:38,240 --> 00:28:41,030
work on so how do you prioritize what to

747
00:28:41,030 --> 00:28:43,309
do given limited time given limited

748
00:28:43,309 --> 00:29:04,910
money that's the real team effort look I

749
00:29:04,910 --> 00:29:08,030
think from from a kind of strategic view

750
00:29:08,030 --> 00:29:11,090
there what you focus on most and the

751
00:29:11,090 --> 00:29:12,800
only way that we scale and survive the

752
00:29:12,800 --> 00:29:15,440
shift into cloud DevOps digital

753
00:29:15,440 --> 00:29:17,210
transformation whatever dev cycles

754
00:29:17,210 --> 00:29:19,720
whatever you want to call it whatever is

755
00:29:19,720 --> 00:29:22,670
focusing on delivering security

756
00:29:22,670 --> 00:29:24,290
capabilities in a way that the

757
00:29:24,290 --> 00:29:26,030
development teams and DevOps teams can

758
00:29:26,030 --> 00:29:28,070
consume them themselves right because I

759
00:29:28,070 --> 00:29:31,370
think the very root of that question the

760
00:29:31,370 --> 00:29:33,170
kind of pressure behind it is the fact

761
00:29:33,170 --> 00:29:35,770
that the velocity is increasing

762
00:29:35,770 --> 00:29:38,870
exponentially and so though I mean for

763
00:29:38,870 --> 00:29:40,910
the last 20 30 years the entire security

764
00:29:40,910 --> 00:29:42,470
industry has been built on this kind of

765
00:29:42,470 --> 00:29:44,300
gatekeeper blocker model that tries to

766
00:29:44,300 --> 00:29:46,550
review everything before a change gets

767
00:29:46,550 --> 00:29:48,830
made or code gets deployed and that just

768
00:29:48,830 --> 00:29:51,470
scale it just falls over completely my

769
00:29:51,470 --> 00:29:55,100
my favorite story actually on that which

770
00:29:55,100 --> 00:29:56,779
is horrifying to security people and

771
00:29:56,779 --> 00:29:59,090
hilarious to development and DevOps

772
00:29:59,090 --> 00:30:03,649
folks was I met about a year ago for

773
00:30:03,649 --> 00:30:05,840
coffee with a CEO of a fortune 100 that

774
00:30:05,840 --> 00:30:08,450
we all know very well and the sisa I

775
00:30:08,450 --> 00:30:10,340
asked them like hey how's your shift to

776
00:30:10,340 --> 00:30:12,049
DevOps and cloud and all of that like

777
00:30:12,049 --> 00:30:13,820
I'm curious your your take on it like

778
00:30:13,820 --> 00:30:15,260
how is that going for you and he

779
00:30:15,260 --> 00:30:17,390
point-blank looked at me and said oh I'm

780
00:30:17,390 --> 00:30:19,370
not allowing that to happen here it's

781
00:30:19,370 --> 00:30:21,260
not secure I don't believe in it it's

782
00:30:21,260 --> 00:30:24,470
not gonna happen here okay that's a bold

783
00:30:24,470 --> 00:30:27,010
career choice would usually be the term

784
00:30:27,010 --> 00:30:30,500
and I went for coffee with the CIO

785
00:30:30,500 --> 00:30:34,850
immediately afterwards we know where

786
00:30:34,850 --> 00:30:37,820
this pump is going hey how do you think

787
00:30:37,820 --> 00:30:39,500
about cloud and DevOps and everything is

788
00:30:39,500 --> 00:30:40,429
that that's a little different like oh

789
00:30:40,429 --> 00:30:42,049
yeah we've got 50 apps in the cloud

790
00:30:42,049 --> 00:30:44,000
today we're gonna have 200 by the end of

791
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:45,049
the year and we're gonna have a few

792
00:30:45,049 --> 00:30:46,970
thousand next year and I looked at them

793
00:30:46,970 --> 00:30:48,470
like oh you talked to the seat in the

794
00:30:48,470 --> 00:30:49,909
sea so yeah we just don't tell them

795
00:30:49,909 --> 00:30:52,730
anymore they just tried to say no to

796
00:30:52,730 --> 00:30:54,620
that and so they're at the kids table

797
00:30:54,620 --> 00:30:56,779
and the adults are making decisions over

798
00:30:56,779 --> 00:30:59,389
here and the reason and they're welcome

799
00:30:59,389 --> 00:31:01,190
back any time but we're gonna make our

800
00:31:01,190 --> 00:31:02,600
own security decisions and we're pushing

801
00:31:02,600 --> 00:31:05,330
forward and the reason I tell that story

802
00:31:05,330 --> 00:31:08,450
not just because it deeply amuses me but

803
00:31:08,450 --> 00:31:11,000
I think it's the perfect example of

804
00:31:11,000 --> 00:31:13,100
where we are as an industry right now

805
00:31:13,100 --> 00:31:15,649
which is that if security tries to hold

806
00:31:15,649 --> 00:31:17,480
on to the old model of being the blocker

807
00:31:17,480 --> 00:31:19,700
in the gatekeeper it just gets routed

808
00:31:19,700 --> 00:31:22,370
around and so back to kind of the

809
00:31:22,370 --> 00:31:23,960
question and the the root of it and I

810
00:31:23,960 --> 00:31:26,389
hope I bought everybody some time it's

811
00:31:26,389 --> 00:31:29,929
really it becomes how does security stop

812
00:31:29,929 --> 00:31:31,970
functioning like that and focus its

813
00:31:31,970 --> 00:31:34,360
highest priority efforts on bringing

814
00:31:34,360 --> 00:31:36,769
capabilities that it had to do in a

815
00:31:36,769 --> 00:31:39,019
highly specialized way to where the

816
00:31:39,019 --> 00:31:40,669
development teams and the DevOps teams

817
00:31:40,669 --> 00:31:43,549
can actually consume security

818
00:31:43,549 --> 00:31:44,929
capabilities themselves because it's the

819
00:31:44,929 --> 00:31:46,429
only way we scale and that has to be the

820
00:31:46,429 --> 00:31:50,480
highest priority I think one thing that

821
00:31:50,480 --> 00:31:52,610
I've learned from security vendors and I

822
00:31:52,610 --> 00:31:54,110
say this would love

823
00:31:54,110 --> 00:31:58,750
is that what they often can be

824
00:31:58,750 --> 00:32:01,700
consistent in their communication they

825
00:32:01,700 --> 00:32:03,409
do often go out to their customers for

826
00:32:03,409 --> 00:32:04,429
their roadmap and I think that's

827
00:32:04,429 --> 00:32:06,559
something that's security myths is when

828
00:32:06,559 --> 00:32:07,820
you're thinking about your roadmap and

829
00:32:07,820 --> 00:32:09,110
everything you've got to do it's really

830
00:32:09,110 --> 00:32:10,490
easy to think about all the things that

831
00:32:10,490 --> 00:32:12,350
you want to do and you feel you need to

832
00:32:12,350 --> 00:32:14,720
do and I've said it it's all very well

833
00:32:14,720 --> 00:32:16,220
providing all these capabilities but

834
00:32:16,220 --> 00:32:17,840
they don't provide value to engineers

835
00:32:17,840 --> 00:32:20,210
then the prospective is going to be that

836
00:32:20,210 --> 00:32:23,059
you didn't provide any value and so um

837
00:32:23,059 --> 00:32:25,429
at the moment I am I say I'm ahead of

838
00:32:25,429 --> 00:32:27,950
predator which is a great title that I'm

839
00:32:27,950 --> 00:32:30,799
a team of one and I'm one of the first

840
00:32:30,799 --> 00:32:32,720
security hires for a Maine pig because

841
00:32:32,720 --> 00:32:34,250
they are added some separations

842
00:32:34,250 --> 00:32:35,720
happening there and so there's a lot to

843
00:32:35,720 --> 00:32:37,130
do and there's a lot of moments where

844
00:32:37,130 --> 00:32:38,840
I'm like there's so much I could do it

845
00:32:38,840 --> 00:32:41,269
once what do I go after and so the first

846
00:32:41,269 --> 00:32:42,470
thing I've done is think about what

847
00:32:42,470 --> 00:32:44,090
value can I provide to the business

848
00:32:44,090 --> 00:32:47,090
immediately there has a an immediate

849
00:32:47,090 --> 00:32:49,250
return on that investment that helps to

850
00:32:49,250 --> 00:32:50,899
increase our value than the other and

851
00:32:50,899 --> 00:32:52,460
this is a spoiler and a shameless plug

852
00:32:52,460 --> 00:32:53,330
for my talk tomorrow

853
00:32:53,330 --> 00:32:55,340
is I've started to create my moon pigs

854
00:32:55,340 --> 00:32:58,760
security Ponzi scheme which is basically

855
00:32:58,760 --> 00:33:00,730
it's a pyramid scheme for security teams

856
00:33:00,730 --> 00:33:03,559
and it's that I don't scale and that as

857
00:33:03,559 --> 00:33:05,149
much as we are hiring and we're trying

858
00:33:05,149 --> 00:33:07,460
to do all these great things what I need

859
00:33:07,460 --> 00:33:11,000
is everyone to do security for me which

860
00:33:11,000 --> 00:33:13,580
makes my job easier and so it's all

861
00:33:13,580 --> 00:33:15,289
about those little increments or pieces

862
00:33:15,289 --> 00:33:17,299
of value that I can deliver whilst

863
00:33:17,299 --> 00:33:19,070
building my own roadmap of the things

864
00:33:19,070 --> 00:33:21,260
that I think are important as an SME but

865
00:33:21,260 --> 00:33:22,760
then also making sure that I'm speaking

866
00:33:22,760 --> 00:33:25,010
to product owners and getting ideas of

867
00:33:25,010 --> 00:33:26,720
what they think is valuable because it's

868
00:33:26,720 --> 00:33:28,070
all very well me coming back to them in

869
00:33:28,070 --> 00:33:29,779
six months time and say I'm ready to

870
00:33:29,779 --> 00:33:31,370
engage now and then they say well we've

871
00:33:31,370 --> 00:33:33,470
already put 200 apps in the cloud so

872
00:33:33,470 --> 00:33:34,130
you're too late

873
00:33:34,130 --> 00:33:37,039
you have to have that conversation and

874
00:33:37,039 --> 00:33:38,750
then that allows you to shape what you

875
00:33:38,750 --> 00:33:40,340
need to go after and for me it's been

876
00:33:40,340 --> 00:33:43,159
really important not one to solely go

877
00:33:43,159 --> 00:33:44,840
after what they want me to go after but

878
00:33:44,840 --> 00:33:46,940
two to be ready to compromise and what I

879
00:33:46,940 --> 00:33:49,159
think is impactful versus what the

880
00:33:49,159 --> 00:33:51,380
business needs and while still being

881
00:33:51,380 --> 00:33:54,620
mindful of regulations not becoming the

882
00:33:54,620 --> 00:33:58,639
next equifax or whoever and still

883
00:33:58,639 --> 00:34:00,080
maintaining my integrity and the

884
00:34:00,080 --> 00:34:02,850
integrity of the business

885
00:34:02,850 --> 00:34:06,790
okay I thought of something so yeah the

886
00:34:06,790 --> 00:34:09,340
best the best thing I've heard on this

887
00:34:09,340 --> 00:34:12,130
actually I swear we didn't talk about

888
00:34:12,130 --> 00:34:13,570
this beforehand it's actually one of the

889
00:34:13,570 --> 00:34:16,389
same stocks from years ago called attack

890
00:34:16,389 --> 00:34:18,040
driven defense and it's a really simple

891
00:34:18,040 --> 00:34:22,120
concept but for some weird reason most

892
00:34:22,120 --> 00:34:23,739
of the security industry doesn't follow

893
00:34:23,739 --> 00:34:27,550
this it's very simple you look at what

894
00:34:27,550 --> 00:34:29,679
real-world attack you know attack

895
00:34:29,679 --> 00:34:31,929
activity looks like and you look at the

896
00:34:31,929 --> 00:34:33,850
attack chain right like what are each of

897
00:34:33,850 --> 00:34:35,320
the steps that unable that attack to

898
00:34:35,320 --> 00:34:39,280
occur and which ones are happening like

899
00:34:39,280 --> 00:34:41,590
at scale right like there's a there's

900
00:34:41,590 --> 00:34:43,540
actually a list it's a known thing

901
00:34:43,540 --> 00:34:45,310
there's a great report that Verizon puts

902
00:34:45,310 --> 00:34:47,889
out every year the dbi are if you aren't

903
00:34:47,889 --> 00:34:49,239
familiar check it out it's amazing I

904
00:34:49,239 --> 00:34:52,270
think it's like 40 pages but it's a very

905
00:34:52,270 --> 00:34:55,270
digestible a lot of beautiful charts and

906
00:34:55,270 --> 00:34:59,320
graphs and that that really is like a

907
00:34:59,320 --> 00:35:01,240
pretty clear roadmap for like what

908
00:35:01,240 --> 00:35:05,050
should be top of top of mind because

909
00:35:05,050 --> 00:35:07,540
that's literally what how companies are

910
00:35:07,540 --> 00:35:10,660
getting hacked like right now so I think

911
00:35:10,660 --> 00:35:12,250
that's probably the number one that I

912
00:35:12,250 --> 00:35:15,550
would personally rely on yeah yeah I

913
00:35:15,550 --> 00:35:18,250
think like having that visibility the

914
00:35:18,250 --> 00:35:19,240
same thing right like you need that

915
00:35:19,240 --> 00:35:21,730
visibility to understand not only like

916
00:35:21,730 --> 00:35:23,830
if and how you're being attacked but

917
00:35:23,830 --> 00:35:25,480
also like to understand your get the

918
00:35:25,480 --> 00:35:27,550
gaps in your defenses that you know that

919
00:35:27,550 --> 00:35:29,800
you recognize as a professional and as

920
00:35:29,800 --> 00:35:31,720
someone who understands you know the

921
00:35:31,720 --> 00:35:34,510
environment that you're operating in and

922
00:35:34,510 --> 00:35:36,610
so like the prioritization thing it's

923
00:35:36,610 --> 00:35:38,590
just it's like the top thing I complain

924
00:35:38,590 --> 00:35:40,450
about it's one of the hardest things you

925
00:35:40,450 --> 00:35:41,980
know that I have to do right it's just

926
00:35:41,980 --> 00:35:43,420
there's competing priorities there's the

927
00:35:43,420 --> 00:35:46,060
business there's CTO had an idea there's

928
00:35:46,060 --> 00:35:49,540
VP had an idea or read a read an article

929
00:35:49,540 --> 00:35:51,910
or something and as well that's not it

930
00:35:51,910 --> 00:35:53,980
doesn't mean it's invalid right and then

931
00:35:53,980 --> 00:35:55,990
there's just like the current status

932
00:35:55,990 --> 00:35:59,290
status of the the industry or you know

933
00:35:59,290 --> 00:36:00,760
like the just what what is being

934
00:36:00,760 --> 00:36:04,510
attacked and wins so yeah I'd to like

935
00:36:04,510 --> 00:36:06,130
think about the priorities every single

936
00:36:06,130 --> 00:36:08,050
day I don't you know it's not as far as

937
00:36:08,050 --> 00:36:09,550
setting a timer what's an hour but it

938
00:36:09,550 --> 00:36:10,900
almost feels like that sometimes to

939
00:36:10,900 --> 00:36:11,920
started thinking about reshuffling the

940
00:36:11,920 --> 00:36:12,540
priority

941
00:36:12,540 --> 00:36:14,880
but really try to focus on honestly the

942
00:36:14,880 --> 00:36:16,860
basics and where you'll be you know

943
00:36:16,860 --> 00:36:19,380
attacked first the the odds of you being

944
00:36:19,380 --> 00:36:21,630
hacked by O'Day or a very targeted

945
00:36:21,630 --> 00:36:23,940
attack are actually pretty low and it's

946
00:36:23,940 --> 00:36:25,530
kind of hard to prove that sort of prove

947
00:36:25,530 --> 00:36:29,130
attack likelihood but I mean most of the

948
00:36:29,130 --> 00:36:30,960
stuff that you read about is open s3

949
00:36:30,960 --> 00:36:33,210
buckets or systems not patched and

950
00:36:33,210 --> 00:36:35,640
patching is hard and at any kind of

951
00:36:35,640 --> 00:36:36,960
scale patching is hard

952
00:36:36,960 --> 00:36:39,060
understanding the inventory of your

953
00:36:39,060 --> 00:36:42,060
asset is difficult you know you got a

954
00:36:42,060 --> 00:36:43,470
hundred servers all right that's fine

955
00:36:43,470 --> 00:36:45,330
easy you have ten thousand twenty

956
00:36:45,330 --> 00:36:48,540
thousand patching is hard and that's

957
00:36:48,540 --> 00:36:49,880
just one of the things that I would just

958
00:36:49,880 --> 00:36:51,960
that an action for management is

959
00:36:51,960 --> 00:36:55,590
difficult as well I just like knowing

960
00:36:55,590 --> 00:36:57,990
about a ulnar ability and not yet doing

961
00:36:57,990 --> 00:36:59,430
something about it and then having that

962
00:36:59,430 --> 00:37:01,830
be the cause of an issue is just like

963
00:37:01,830 --> 00:37:04,080
that's just inexcusable for me but

964
00:37:04,080 --> 00:37:08,070
that's the state of the industry if you

965
00:37:08,070 --> 00:37:09,930
go to any delivery scheme I bet in any

966
00:37:09,930 --> 00:37:12,090
company and you run like a frat molding

967
00:37:12,090 --> 00:37:14,520
session or just like an AMA on security

968
00:37:14,520 --> 00:37:16,050
or whatever there's always going to be

969
00:37:16,050 --> 00:37:17,250
someone that says oh yeah but we all

970
00:37:17,250 --> 00:37:19,050
know that there is X and you'll be like

971
00:37:19,050 --> 00:37:22,170
what but that's common and you're

972
00:37:22,170 --> 00:37:24,270
absolutely right in there there are so

973
00:37:24,270 --> 00:37:26,250
many teams that don't know how to raise

974
00:37:26,250 --> 00:37:28,050
a vulnerability and how to tell you

975
00:37:28,050 --> 00:37:30,150
there's this thing and I don't know how

976
00:37:30,150 --> 00:37:31,620
to do it and this is really key and I

977
00:37:31,620 --> 00:37:33,390
know we've we've all kind of mentioned

978
00:37:33,390 --> 00:37:34,500
you know you should be able to talk to

979
00:37:34,500 --> 00:37:36,180
your security teams but in many

980
00:37:36,180 --> 00:37:38,190
companies there's still a stigma of an

981
00:37:38,190 --> 00:37:39,570
engineer saying and there's this big

982
00:37:39,570 --> 00:37:41,100
vulnerability and feeling like they're

983
00:37:41,100 --> 00:37:44,720
gonna get told off for ashamed or

984
00:37:44,720 --> 00:37:46,980
whatever because they're trying to tell

985
00:37:46,980 --> 00:37:47,940
you there's something wrong with their

986
00:37:47,940 --> 00:37:51,240
application I've also seen recently and

987
00:37:51,240 --> 00:37:52,260
I don't and this is something that other

988
00:37:52,260 --> 00:37:54,120
people have seen but over the last

989
00:37:54,120 --> 00:37:56,940
couple of years I've seen teams almost

990
00:37:56,940 --> 00:37:59,100
be swayed by product owners to not talk

991
00:37:59,100 --> 00:38:01,590
about vulnerabilities because they want

992
00:38:01,590 --> 00:38:03,690
to push for features I see some laughs

993
00:38:03,690 --> 00:38:05,400
so everything it sounds like I've known

994
00:38:05,400 --> 00:38:08,040
by myself yeah but it's just really

995
00:38:08,040 --> 00:38:09,780
interesting and how this push for a

996
00:38:09,780 --> 00:38:11,910
feature and ultimately that kind of

997
00:38:11,910 --> 00:38:14,790
bottom line return on investment as a

998
00:38:14,790 --> 00:38:17,070
company level is that you know let's

999
00:38:17,070 --> 00:38:18,630
just kind of sweep over the fact that

1000
00:38:18,630 --> 00:38:20,940
we're maybe I don't know 1az and

1001
00:38:20,940 --> 00:38:24,599
ws or we're all running off of one ec2

1002
00:38:24,599 --> 00:38:26,910
it's and so whatever it is but I just

1003
00:38:26,910 --> 00:38:29,310
find it really interesting that as a

1004
00:38:29,310 --> 00:38:31,550
product owner the push to them is

1005
00:38:31,550 --> 00:38:34,440
features because that's ultimately if

1006
00:38:34,440 --> 00:38:35,430
you look at a lot of company's

1007
00:38:35,430 --> 00:38:38,160
objectives its I don't know increase

1008
00:38:38,160 --> 00:38:41,579
purchases of X by X or whatever and so

1009
00:38:41,579 --> 00:38:43,140
that's that push on feature and not

1010
00:38:43,140 --> 00:38:45,390
optimization or resiliency and security

1011
00:38:45,390 --> 00:38:46,880
answers

1012
00:38:46,880 --> 00:38:49,560
it's almost implied but not like there's

1013
00:38:49,560 --> 00:38:51,450
no like okay are there's no like

1014
00:38:51,450 --> 00:38:52,859
quarterly gold that says don't get

1015
00:38:52,859 --> 00:38:56,910
hacked implied right yeah they don't

1016
00:38:56,910 --> 00:38:58,140
want the security don't necessarily want

1017
00:38:58,140 --> 00:39:01,230
to invest all the time and I think again

1018
00:39:01,230 --> 00:39:03,720
I'll air quote shift left but like that

1019
00:39:03,720 --> 00:39:05,250
finding the vulnerabilities earlier or

1020
00:39:05,250 --> 00:39:06,780
preventing them from being created in

1021
00:39:06,780 --> 00:39:07,470
the first place

1022
00:39:07,470 --> 00:39:09,119
is important just because it prevents

1023
00:39:09,119 --> 00:39:11,880
this like tech debt of of security bugs

1024
00:39:11,880 --> 00:39:13,170
from piling up and then they have to

1025
00:39:13,170 --> 00:39:15,060
stop what they're doing concentrate on

1026
00:39:15,060 --> 00:39:16,829
fixing a bunch of bugs rather than

1027
00:39:16,829 --> 00:39:18,960
shipping features and as you said you

1028
00:39:18,960 --> 00:39:20,670
know the company if the business is

1029
00:39:20,670 --> 00:39:22,290
making money we don't have a job so it's

1030
00:39:22,290 --> 00:39:24,180
it's it's hard when it gets to that

1031
00:39:24,180 --> 00:39:26,160
point it's it's a huge trade-off at that

1032
00:39:26,160 --> 00:39:27,839
point that's I think that's why both

1033
00:39:27,839 --> 00:39:31,829
management is really difficult but all

1034
00:39:31,829 --> 00:39:34,349
right very cool we are open for

1035
00:39:34,349 --> 00:39:38,280
questions so what a yes and please be

1036
00:39:38,280 --> 00:39:40,500
loud unfortunately we're using all the

1037
00:39:40,500 --> 00:39:42,650
mics

1038
00:40:25,150 --> 00:40:28,299
yeah that's a really great question so

1039
00:40:28,299 --> 00:40:30,670
have we made any attempts to quantify

1040
00:40:30,670 --> 00:40:34,119
risk and like if so how do you do that

1041
00:40:34,119 --> 00:40:35,890
effectively and then how do you

1042
00:40:35,890 --> 00:40:38,259
communicate that to say upper management

1043
00:40:38,259 --> 00:40:41,200
is that a reasonable yeah that's an

1044
00:40:41,200 --> 00:40:42,519
excellent question I love it yeah that

1045
00:40:42,519 --> 00:40:44,710
is a really good question um up

1046
00:40:44,710 --> 00:40:47,319
I'll start it's and it's not a great

1047
00:40:47,319 --> 00:40:49,720
answer but it is I I agree like it's

1048
00:40:49,720 --> 00:40:51,730
it's important to me and I think a lot

1049
00:40:51,730 --> 00:40:53,619
of the stuff that Ryan McGinness has

1050
00:40:53,619 --> 00:40:54,940
blogged about in the past about

1051
00:40:54,940 --> 00:40:58,059
forecasting is really important we have

1052
00:40:58,059 --> 00:41:00,490
we have that as a we do we do

1053
00:41:00,490 --> 00:41:02,619
okay ours objective and key results and

1054
00:41:02,619 --> 00:41:05,440
it's like these two or three like goals

1055
00:41:05,440 --> 00:41:07,690
I guess for the quarter and that's one

1056
00:41:07,690 --> 00:41:10,119
of our okay ours for this quarter is to

1057
00:41:10,119 --> 00:41:12,549
really dig into and we've dabbled in the

1058
00:41:12,549 --> 00:41:14,319
past but it's like you have to kind of

1059
00:41:14,319 --> 00:41:16,150
train yourself to or you have to learn

1060
00:41:16,150 --> 00:41:18,700
how to forecast before you can start

1061
00:41:18,700 --> 00:41:20,650
forecasting things like like risk and

1062
00:41:20,650 --> 00:41:22,299
and like doing more threat modeling and

1063
00:41:22,299 --> 00:41:24,420
things of that nature to try to find out

1064
00:41:24,420 --> 00:41:27,730
in some scientific manner what is going

1065
00:41:27,730 --> 00:41:30,519
to bite us first and focus on that how

1066
00:41:30,519 --> 00:41:38,049
do you forecast but I mean it is

1067
00:41:38,049 --> 00:41:39,249
essentially you take like a kind of a

1068
00:41:39,249 --> 00:41:42,789
concrete thing and then based on you

1069
00:41:42,789 --> 00:41:43,989
know your knowledge of the system in

1070
00:41:43,989 --> 00:41:46,390
which you're operating in your knowledge

1071
00:41:46,390 --> 00:41:48,099
or experiences security professional or

1072
00:41:48,099 --> 00:41:50,170
development professional or like so some

1073
00:41:50,170 --> 00:41:52,089
sort of you need some knowledge in that

1074
00:41:52,089 --> 00:41:54,640
general area you can you attempt to

1075
00:41:54,640 --> 00:41:57,279
predict you know the likelihood of that

1076
00:41:57,279 --> 00:42:00,249
thing happening but yeah Ryan begin at

1077
00:42:00,249 --> 00:42:01,989
Magoo has done a lot of work around here

1078
00:42:01,989 --> 00:42:03,789
and I think it's really something worth

1079
00:42:03,789 --> 00:42:05,950
trying really like digging into I don't

1080
00:42:05,950 --> 00:42:08,619
know if it'll work for data dog in 2020

1081
00:42:08,619 --> 00:42:11,019
but that's some work over I'm also

1082
00:42:11,019 --> 00:42:13,630
looking at those as well I think how it

1083
00:42:13,630 --> 00:42:16,569
works is something something like a

1084
00:42:16,569 --> 00:42:18,220
little bit of like wisdom of the crowds

1085
00:42:18,220 --> 00:42:20,319
thing but at us obviously a smaller

1086
00:42:20,319 --> 00:42:21,460
scale like the scale of your security

1087
00:42:21,460 --> 00:42:24,160
team and yeah I guess there's a lot of

1088
00:42:24,160 --> 00:42:26,650
research I again I read these posts a

1089
00:42:26,650 --> 00:42:28,210
probably like two three months ago I

1090
00:42:28,210 --> 00:42:31,119
need to reread them but I think it was

1091
00:42:31,119 --> 00:42:34,660
like that

1092
00:42:34,660 --> 00:42:38,859
X teams of experts tend to actually get

1093
00:42:38,859 --> 00:42:41,140
pretty close to predicting accurately

1094
00:42:41,140 --> 00:42:43,630
the risk of hypotheticals in the future

1095
00:42:43,630 --> 00:42:45,880
as long as they're like fairly similar

1096
00:42:45,880 --> 00:42:47,849
to events that have occurred in the past

1097
00:42:47,849 --> 00:42:50,109
and so I think that's roughly the

1098
00:42:50,109 --> 00:42:52,509
concept which then allows you to make a

1099
00:42:52,509 --> 00:42:56,559
forecast of risk projection and then you

1100
00:42:56,559 --> 00:42:58,269
know at least quasi scientifically

1101
00:42:58,269 --> 00:43:00,609
measure a reduction of that risk after

1102
00:43:00,609 --> 00:43:02,230
you've finished you know whatever you

1103
00:43:02,230 --> 00:43:03,880
know security project or a security

1104
00:43:03,880 --> 00:43:05,920
engineering REO architecture of a

1105
00:43:05,920 --> 00:43:08,019
service whatever it may be you can say

1106
00:43:08,019 --> 00:43:10,690
okay you know we have reduced the risk

1107
00:43:10,690 --> 00:43:13,630
in this area by + % now that this is

1108
00:43:13,630 --> 00:43:15,940
done so I believe that's roughly the

1109
00:43:15,940 --> 00:43:17,349
concept and it's something that I'm also

1110
00:43:17,349 --> 00:43:19,630
looking at cool I don't disagree with

1111
00:43:19,630 --> 00:43:21,339
anything that you both have said but I

1112
00:43:21,339 --> 00:43:23,349
want something more actionable it's

1113
00:43:23,349 --> 00:43:24,490
supposed to think there are two things

1114
00:43:24,490 --> 00:43:26,589
that really annoy me about management

1115
00:43:26,589 --> 00:43:28,930
right what is that there are so many

1116
00:43:28,930 --> 00:43:30,369
frameworks and none of them are written

1117
00:43:30,369 --> 00:43:33,519
for credit donors so like the whole idea

1118
00:43:33,519 --> 00:43:35,109
is that you have like ease of

1119
00:43:35,109 --> 00:43:37,150
exploitation likelihood to exploit all

1120
00:43:37,150 --> 00:43:38,859
of these different levels and yet as a

1121
00:43:38,859 --> 00:43:41,829
product owner this is me in life they

1122
00:43:41,829 --> 00:43:43,690
don't understand that and yet they're

1123
00:43:43,690 --> 00:43:45,309
expected to make a decision based on

1124
00:43:45,309 --> 00:43:47,500
those frameworks and the second is we

1125
00:43:47,500 --> 00:43:49,450
never give them data points right so if

1126
00:43:49,450 --> 00:43:51,430
your product owner or whoever accept the

1127
00:43:51,430 --> 00:43:53,920
risk and you say it's medium how many

1128
00:43:53,920 --> 00:43:56,259
people if they see that exploit it or

1129
00:43:56,259 --> 00:43:57,789
they see an attack actually loop all the

1130
00:43:57,789 --> 00:44:00,190
way back to that predator you know even

1131
00:44:00,190 --> 00:44:01,420
if they're no longer the owner of that

1132
00:44:01,420 --> 00:44:03,430
product and say hey that actually

1133
00:44:03,430 --> 00:44:06,670
happened and so we don't complete that

1134
00:44:06,670 --> 00:44:08,200
feedback loop and I've seen it in

1135
00:44:08,200 --> 00:44:10,569
previous companies where a product owner

1136
00:44:10,569 --> 00:44:12,130
you know we've come back in and we said

1137
00:44:12,130 --> 00:44:13,539
that's a that's a critic or that's a

1138
00:44:13,539 --> 00:44:15,490
high and they said well we're coming up

1139
00:44:15,490 --> 00:44:17,920
to our peak season or Christmas and so

1140
00:44:17,920 --> 00:44:20,380
we're gonna accept it anyway and yeah we

1141
00:44:20,380 --> 00:44:22,750
see I don't know a significant amount of

1142
00:44:22,750 --> 00:44:24,460
fraud or whatever it might be as an

1143
00:44:24,460 --> 00:44:28,180
output and yet there's never that comes

1144
00:44:28,180 --> 00:44:29,529
through the security team as an incident

1145
00:44:29,529 --> 00:44:30,970
or a fraud team as an incident and that

1146
00:44:30,970 --> 00:44:32,740
doesn't make its way to the product

1147
00:44:32,740 --> 00:44:34,089
owner because they're not part of the

1148
00:44:34,089 --> 00:44:36,430
operational response and so they have no

1149
00:44:36,430 --> 00:44:38,490
idea that there was actually an

1150
00:44:38,490 --> 00:44:39,810
Siddhant off the back of that and so

1151
00:44:39,810 --> 00:44:41,130
they've made that decision thinking well

1152
00:44:41,130 --> 00:44:42,300
I accepted a critical and nothing

1153
00:44:42,300 --> 00:44:44,550
happened so let's carry on and at the

1154
00:44:44,550 --> 00:44:46,530
end of the day that amount of money lost

1155
00:44:46,530 --> 00:44:48,540
in operational overhead or response or

1156
00:44:48,540 --> 00:44:51,090
overtime or whatever never goes back to

1157
00:44:51,090 --> 00:44:52,410
the effects of their budget or their

1158
00:44:52,410 --> 00:44:54,750
bottom line so they've got no reason to

1159
00:44:54,750 --> 00:44:57,290
care about accepting that or not and so

1160
00:44:57,290 --> 00:45:00,000
one thing and and I'm this might not

1161
00:45:00,000 --> 00:45:01,500
work for everyone it works for me is I

1162
00:45:01,500 --> 00:45:03,510
still I still refer to things like that

1163
00:45:03,510 --> 00:45:06,960
I was risk ratings matrix and things

1164
00:45:06,960 --> 00:45:09,119
like that to help me quantify risk for

1165
00:45:09,119 --> 00:45:10,560
an audit perspective right because it's

1166
00:45:10,560 --> 00:45:11,760
still important to be able to say this

1167
00:45:11,760 --> 00:45:13,050
is critical high medium or low so you

1168
00:45:13,050 --> 00:45:14,250
can follow your risk management very

1169
00:45:14,250 --> 00:45:16,230
much but my credit owner does not give a

1170
00:45:16,230 --> 00:45:18,720
 about any of that and so what I

1171
00:45:18,720 --> 00:45:21,060
started to do and mostly to keep myself

1172
00:45:21,060 --> 00:45:23,010
entertained is to actually demonstrate

1173
00:45:23,010 --> 00:45:25,080
the vulnerability or the exploit to the

1174
00:45:25,080 --> 00:45:27,450
product team and often in real times

1175
00:45:27,450 --> 00:45:30,420
it's really fun and my favorite is a

1176
00:45:30,420 --> 00:45:32,670
script that I run it just brings back a

1177
00:45:32,670 --> 00:45:34,350
load of public buckets with Prudential

1178
00:45:34,350 --> 00:45:38,220
text file dot CSV and milla native

1179
00:45:38,220 --> 00:45:40,800
access keys or and it's all about that

1180
00:45:40,800 --> 00:45:42,330
demo right and then I show them how

1181
00:45:42,330 --> 00:45:44,520
really is in how easy avec I don't have

1182
00:45:44,520 --> 00:45:46,460
to then say okay use of exploiters five

1183
00:45:46,460 --> 00:45:48,750
or whatever I'm just actually showing

1184
00:45:48,750 --> 00:45:50,340
them and then it makes it so much more

1185
00:45:50,340 --> 00:45:52,350
real or I give them I've shown before

1186
00:45:52,350 --> 00:45:54,119
like even news articles of other

1187
00:45:54,119 --> 00:45:55,560
companies breaches and just said that's

1188
00:45:55,560 --> 00:45:57,750
that's the same thing or I've shown them

1189
00:45:57,750 --> 00:45:59,640
might bug bounty reports and the number

1190
00:45:59,640 --> 00:46:00,780
of bouncey submissions we've had

1191
00:46:00,780 --> 00:46:02,430
historically for a similar bug

1192
00:46:02,430 --> 00:46:04,410
classification and then that's showing

1193
00:46:04,410 --> 00:46:07,230
them okay they're found really easy but

1194
00:46:07,230 --> 00:46:08,369
it's just made it a little bit more real

1195
00:46:08,369 --> 00:46:09,480
or sometimes I've said actually it's

1196
00:46:09,480 --> 00:46:11,310
really hard to see that or it's really

1197
00:46:11,310 --> 00:46:13,590
hard to to cover it and so it's made it

1198
00:46:13,590 --> 00:46:14,790
a bit more real so then when they do

1199
00:46:14,790 --> 00:46:16,440
risk accept or when they're looking at

1200
00:46:16,440 --> 00:46:18,869
quantification of risk it's a little bit

1201
00:46:18,869 --> 00:46:20,220
more translatable to them but then I

1202
00:46:20,220 --> 00:46:22,590
still have my framework version from an

1203
00:46:22,590 --> 00:46:24,420
audit perspective so I kind of hid my

1204
00:46:24,420 --> 00:46:28,290
PCI DSS or I say 27001 or whatever it is

1205
00:46:28,290 --> 00:46:31,770
I'm going after and I get so frustrated

1206
00:46:31,770 --> 00:46:34,200
I kind of like how annoyed I get about

1207
00:46:34,200 --> 00:46:35,880
the number of times the security people

1208
00:46:35,880 --> 00:46:37,590
we deal with incidents and we never go

1209
00:46:37,590 --> 00:46:39,480
back to the person that risk except or

1210
00:46:39,480 --> 00:46:42,150
chose not to fix or deprioritize as a

1211
00:46:42,150 --> 00:46:44,280
product and I really feel quite

1212
00:46:44,280 --> 00:46:46,440
passionately that that's something that

1213
00:46:46,440 --> 00:46:48,890
we're really missing in security is that

1214
00:46:48,890 --> 00:46:50,570
full feedback loop and I'm not necessary

1215
00:46:50,570 --> 00:46:51,890
talking about purple teaming because

1216
00:46:51,890 --> 00:46:53,900
this could be six months after the

1217
00:46:53,900 --> 00:46:55,280
factory year after the fact but there

1218
00:46:55,280 --> 00:46:57,260
should be a way of us saying that

1219
00:46:57,260 --> 00:47:00,080
decision cost us X amount of money and

1220
00:47:00,080 --> 00:47:02,360
this is the impact of resource and time

1221
00:47:02,360 --> 00:47:05,000
and actually how would that change and

1222
00:47:05,000 --> 00:47:06,200
how do we start holding people

1223
00:47:06,200 --> 00:47:08,300
accountable in a way where we can then

1224
00:47:08,300 --> 00:47:11,000
change KPIs and objectives today you

1225
00:47:11,000 --> 00:47:12,830
know one of our objectives is not to

1226
00:47:12,830 --> 00:47:14,690
lose X amount of money in bug bounty

1227
00:47:14,690 --> 00:47:18,590
payments or on call time for incidents

1228
00:47:18,590 --> 00:47:22,460
or I don't know breaches or whatever it

1229
00:47:22,460 --> 00:47:24,700
might be

1230
00:47:26,800 --> 00:47:29,200
Zane do you want to say anything

1231
00:47:29,200 --> 00:47:31,460
yeah I'll pass one in just for the

1232
00:47:31,460 --> 00:47:34,190
communicating to kind of the board into

1233
00:47:34,190 --> 00:47:35,660
executive leadership and that side of

1234
00:47:35,660 --> 00:47:38,450
the risk question which was we tried a

1235
00:47:38,450 --> 00:47:40,070
lot of different things there and the

1236
00:47:40,070 --> 00:47:42,110
stuff that really stuck was we'd say

1237
00:47:42,110 --> 00:47:44,000
okay as far as risks to the business

1238
00:47:44,000 --> 00:47:47,390
here here's the kind of top ten ones

1239
00:47:47,390 --> 00:47:49,250
that we're that we as a security program

1240
00:47:49,250 --> 00:47:50,810
are gonna be working on this year and

1241
00:47:50,810 --> 00:47:53,240
map each one of those to something you

1242
00:47:53,240 --> 00:47:55,970
said which spot-on map each one of those

1243
00:47:55,970 --> 00:47:57,740
to a breach that they had heard about so

1244
00:47:57,740 --> 00:47:59,660
they could easily very easily digest it

1245
00:47:59,660 --> 00:48:02,540
and in those risks by the way it was

1246
00:48:02,540 --> 00:48:04,190
very important to put all of those in

1247
00:48:04,190 --> 00:48:05,870
business terms so it's not we're gonna

1248
00:48:05,870 --> 00:48:09,500
work on cross-site scripting great that

1249
00:48:09,500 --> 00:48:11,270
sounds exciting or terrible I don't know

1250
00:48:11,270 --> 00:48:13,250
I'm a board member right it's we are

1251
00:48:13,250 --> 00:48:15,410
going to be working on protecting user

1252
00:48:15,410 --> 00:48:18,410
data for the API or for the mobile app

1253
00:48:18,410 --> 00:48:20,570
or the main site or something in kind of

1254
00:48:20,570 --> 00:48:23,210
business terms there map it to breaches

1255
00:48:23,210 --> 00:48:24,800
that they knew about and then we'd say

1256
00:48:24,800 --> 00:48:26,930
the two kind of axes that were measuring

1257
00:48:26,930 --> 00:48:30,710
on are our ability to detect someone

1258
00:48:30,710 --> 00:48:32,180
attacking us there and our ability to

1259
00:48:32,180 --> 00:48:34,430
make it much more difficult for them and

1260
00:48:34,430 --> 00:48:36,800
so for these ten kind of top-level

1261
00:48:36,800 --> 00:48:39,860
strategic risks we there's a lot of 0 is

1262
00:48:39,860 --> 00:48:41,810
on that list right now and we'd be

1263
00:48:41,810 --> 00:48:43,400
impacted by a lot of those same style of

1264
00:48:43,400 --> 00:48:46,940
breaches so our goal was to get ability

1265
00:48:46,940 --> 00:48:49,220
to detect to like kind of ballpark it

1266
00:48:49,220 --> 00:48:51,230
let's say 50% for a bunch of these and

1267
00:48:51,230 --> 00:48:54,140
for a bunch of them make it 80% that

1268
00:48:54,140 --> 00:48:55,520
we've made it much more difficult for

1269
00:48:55,520 --> 00:48:56,310
somebody to do

1270
00:48:56,310 --> 00:48:58,710
so like a risk just to kind of tie it

1271
00:48:58,710 --> 00:49:02,820
together a risk might be this is less

1272
00:49:02,820 --> 00:49:04,730
today than it certainly was 10 years ago

1273
00:49:04,730 --> 00:49:07,080
we're gonna reduce the risks that of

1274
00:49:07,080 --> 00:49:10,860
lost or stolen customer data based on

1275
00:49:10,860 --> 00:49:12,990
employee devices so what we're gonna do

1276
00:49:12,990 --> 00:49:14,370
from there we're gonna get all of our

1277
00:49:14,370 --> 00:49:17,700
employee laptops encrypted and we're

1278
00:49:17,700 --> 00:49:19,560
going to have that control in place okay

1279
00:49:19,560 --> 00:49:21,060
now here's what we've done against that

1280
00:49:21,060 --> 00:49:23,190
because here's 50 news articles about

1281
00:49:23,190 --> 00:49:25,560
somebody leaving their laptop at the pub

1282
00:49:25,560 --> 00:49:27,360
or in a taxi or something like that and

1283
00:49:27,360 --> 00:49:28,680
there was a massive breach as a result

1284
00:49:28,680 --> 00:49:31,500
and so mapping it like that to the board

1285
00:49:31,500 --> 00:49:33,300
and to the executive leadership in terms

1286
00:49:33,300 --> 00:49:35,190
they can understand what you're doing to

1287
00:49:35,190 --> 00:49:37,110
get the job done and then you later on

1288
00:49:37,110 --> 00:49:39,630
to really kind of build a effective

1289
00:49:39,630 --> 00:49:41,220
program you map all of your resource

1290
00:49:41,220 --> 00:49:43,920
requests back to that's you say I'm

1291
00:49:43,920 --> 00:49:45,390
asking for headcount here and budget

1292
00:49:45,390 --> 00:49:47,250
here to be able to move this from zero

1293
00:49:47,250 --> 00:49:49,350
to 50 percent you don't want to give me

1294
00:49:49,350 --> 00:49:50,580
a head count okay we can leave that

1295
00:49:50,580 --> 00:49:53,010
massive headline breach at zero percent

1296
00:49:53,010 --> 00:49:55,530
but that's in terms that you very much

1297
00:49:55,530 --> 00:49:58,830
understand now yeah I like that

1298
00:49:58,830 --> 00:50:01,440
I also heard so there's a book called

1299
00:50:01,440 --> 00:50:03,300
how to measure anything in cybersecurity

1300
00:50:03,300 --> 00:50:05,190
risk I haven't read it but I've heard

1301
00:50:05,190 --> 00:50:08,580
good things there's a new new ish model

1302
00:50:08,580 --> 00:50:12,030
for quantifying risk called a fair fa ir

1303
00:50:12,030 --> 00:50:14,670
i know a couple of people who are into

1304
00:50:14,670 --> 00:50:16,620
it I haven't looked at it too much in

1305
00:50:16,620 --> 00:50:19,530
detail and then some friends of mine on

1306
00:50:19,530 --> 00:50:20,970
the Netflix security team have been

1307
00:50:20,970 --> 00:50:21,990
doing some pretty interesting things

1308
00:50:21,990 --> 00:50:25,410
where basically they're trying to build

1309
00:50:25,410 --> 00:50:29,790
this like real-time data driven model of

1310
00:50:29,790 --> 00:50:33,870
how risky are given services so let's

1311
00:50:33,870 --> 00:50:35,400
say you have all of your applications

1312
00:50:35,400 --> 00:50:37,260
going through the same CI CD pipeline

1313
00:50:37,260 --> 00:50:40,650
you have real-time data of all the

1314
00:50:40,650 --> 00:50:42,780
systems running in production basically

1315
00:50:42,780 --> 00:50:45,660
what they can do is they have built a

1316
00:50:45,660 --> 00:50:48,390
number of security controls such as a

1317
00:50:48,390 --> 00:50:50,460
service that makes it easy to do mutual

1318
00:50:50,460 --> 00:50:53,310
TLS between services they have like a

1319
00:50:53,310 --> 00:50:56,520
nice hardened like access control

1320
00:50:56,520 --> 00:50:58,080
library that everything is supposed to

1321
00:50:58,080 --> 00:51:00,300
use do I talk to each other

1322
00:51:00,300 --> 00:51:02,340
and various other like security controls

1323
00:51:02,340 --> 00:51:04,770
so they can sort of in a lightweight

1324
00:51:04,770 --> 00:51:06,990
automatic way say what out of all the

1325
00:51:06,990 --> 00:51:09,000
different code bases who is using the

1326
00:51:09,000 --> 00:51:10,590
security controls we built and who isn't

1327
00:51:10,590 --> 00:51:14,340
and then also based on like live AWS

1328
00:51:14,340 --> 00:51:17,280
data for a given service like how many

1329
00:51:17,280 --> 00:51:19,080
instances are running right so like is

1330
00:51:19,080 --> 00:51:20,850
this code base running on one ec2

1331
00:51:20,850 --> 00:51:23,580
instance versus like a thousand you have

1332
00:51:23,580 --> 00:51:25,860
other meta information like is this edge

1333
00:51:25,860 --> 00:51:28,230
facing like is this directly connected

1334
00:51:28,230 --> 00:51:30,030
to the Internet versus internal only

1335
00:51:30,030 --> 00:51:31,740
obviously something that anyone can talk

1336
00:51:31,740 --> 00:51:33,840
to is more risky and then also how

1337
00:51:33,840 --> 00:51:35,580
important is a service to the business

1338
00:51:35,580 --> 00:51:39,380
so you know is this like our core

1339
00:51:39,380 --> 00:51:41,640
streaming or payments processing or is

1340
00:51:41,640 --> 00:51:43,560
it some like internal thing that like we

1341
00:51:43,560 --> 00:51:44,760
kind of don't want it to go down but

1342
00:51:44,760 --> 00:51:46,560
it's fine if it does so so there's many

1343
00:51:46,560 --> 00:51:49,860
axes of types of things that make

1344
00:51:49,860 --> 00:51:51,750
something more or less important or

1345
00:51:51,750 --> 00:51:53,490
risky to the business and if you can

1346
00:51:53,490 --> 00:51:55,620
like programmatically automatically

1347
00:51:55,620 --> 00:51:58,680
determine sort of the security settings

1348
00:51:58,680 --> 00:52:00,840
either of the code and the controls as

1349
00:52:00,840 --> 00:52:04,320
well as how it's running live in

1350
00:52:04,320 --> 00:52:06,000
production you can basically build this

1351
00:52:06,000 --> 00:52:09,600
a continuous model of like hey we you

1352
00:52:09,600 --> 00:52:11,790
know and also like what are the

1353
00:52:11,790 --> 00:52:14,790
vulnerabilities that are currently in an

1354
00:52:14,790 --> 00:52:16,500
application weather was found by like

1355
00:52:16,500 --> 00:52:18,660
pen tests or out of date dependencies or

1356
00:52:18,660 --> 00:52:20,820
things like that so collecting all of

1357
00:52:20,820 --> 00:52:22,830
these things you can say oh hey we have

1358
00:52:22,830 --> 00:52:24,990
this one service that has like a high

1359
00:52:24,990 --> 00:52:27,210
vulnerability that hasn't been fixed it

1360
00:52:27,210 --> 00:52:28,800
doesn't have this one security control

1361
00:52:28,800 --> 00:52:31,860
also it's in production on like 10,000

1362
00:52:31,860 --> 00:52:33,900
ec2 instances we should probably fix

1363
00:52:33,900 --> 00:52:36,570
this like right now versus yeah this one

1364
00:52:36,570 --> 00:52:38,280
has a critical issue but its internal

1365
00:52:38,280 --> 00:52:41,010
only and it's running on like one server

1366
00:52:41,010 --> 00:52:43,050
and it doesn't have access to any PII so

1367
00:52:43,050 --> 00:52:44,550
like maybe we'll get to it eventually

1368
00:52:44,550 --> 00:52:47,880
but yeah basically I thought that was a

1369
00:52:47,880 --> 00:52:49,980
very clever way to programmatically try

1370
00:52:49,980 --> 00:52:52,800
to infer risk based on where you should

1371
00:52:52,800 --> 00:52:55,500
prioritize time yeah we can talk more

1372
00:52:55,500 --> 00:53:00,240
about that later so more questions you

1373
00:53:00,240 --> 00:53:02,479
sir

1374
00:53:13,440 --> 00:53:16,550
[Music]

1375
00:53:21,280 --> 00:53:25,100
not in next-gen was it a next-gen it's

1376
00:53:25,100 --> 00:53:28,299
friends like these

1377
00:53:47,410 --> 00:53:50,690
yeah yeah that's a good question so I

1378
00:53:50,690 --> 00:53:53,630
believe that to summarize historically

1379
00:53:53,630 --> 00:53:55,280
security wasn't very technical it was

1380
00:53:55,280 --> 00:53:58,910
very like policy driven now there's a

1381
00:53:58,910 --> 00:54:01,400
more emphasis on understanding the

1382
00:54:01,400 --> 00:54:03,200
technical details of platforms and sort

1383
00:54:03,200 --> 00:54:04,820
of the inherent risks there and being

1384
00:54:04,820 --> 00:54:07,130
able to either contribute directly in an

1385
00:54:07,130 --> 00:54:10,130
engineering capacity or just I guess

1386
00:54:10,130 --> 00:54:11,900
offer more detailed actionable guidance

1387
00:54:11,900 --> 00:54:15,200
is that reasonable cool thank you I like

1388
00:54:15,200 --> 00:54:18,290
yeah I think it's the same conduct it's

1389
00:54:18,290 --> 00:54:20,630
a little bit one I've seen a lot more

1390
00:54:20,630 --> 00:54:22,340
companies but I do think that for the

1391
00:54:22,340 --> 00:54:23,930
most part I think you still have that

1392
00:54:23,930 --> 00:54:25,280
divide I think it just depends on the

1393
00:54:25,280 --> 00:54:27,470
type of company and whether they really

1394
00:54:27,470 --> 00:54:29,140
value that sort of like technical work

1395
00:54:29,140 --> 00:54:31,970
like it just from my own experience data

1396
00:54:31,970 --> 00:54:33,290
dogs a highly technical company the

1397
00:54:33,290 --> 00:54:35,720
cofounders are are our engineers by

1398
00:54:35,720 --> 00:54:37,400
trade these they're still very technical

1399
00:54:37,400 --> 00:54:38,570
that still keep up on that stuff and so

1400
00:54:38,570 --> 00:54:40,220
they they understand the need for a

1401
00:54:40,220 --> 00:54:42,200
technical team Lee they won't happen any

1402
00:54:42,200 --> 00:54:44,030
other way right and I think the other

1403
00:54:44,030 --> 00:54:46,640
thing as well with modern development

1404
00:54:46,640 --> 00:54:49,490
methodologies the way you interact with

1405
00:54:49,490 --> 00:54:51,800
those that like everyone writes code

1406
00:54:51,800 --> 00:54:53,330
everyone we hire on the security team

1407
00:54:53,330 --> 00:54:55,670
writes code some do it like that's their

1408
00:54:55,670 --> 00:54:57,440
job we have we hired developers that

1409
00:54:57,440 --> 00:54:58,910
also happen to be pretty good with

1410
00:54:58,910 --> 00:55:00,859
security or just developers who are

1411
00:55:00,859 --> 00:55:02,960
interested in security and literally

1412
00:55:02,960 --> 00:55:04,339
their job is to write tools application

1413
00:55:04,339 --> 00:55:07,940
services to either you know allow the

1414
00:55:07,940 --> 00:55:10,040
security team to do things or to you

1415
00:55:10,040 --> 00:55:11,330
know for the benefit of developers to

1416
00:55:11,330 --> 00:55:13,460
make things easier for them and and and

1417
00:55:13,460 --> 00:55:17,000
create you know libraries and things

1418
00:55:17,000 --> 00:55:18,109
like that

1419
00:55:18,109 --> 00:55:20,690
and so I think that's that is pushing

1420
00:55:20,690 --> 00:55:22,910
that but it but I mean there's kind of a

1421
00:55:22,910 --> 00:55:24,230
tech company right or a software company

1422
00:55:24,230 --> 00:55:26,960
right so that's that is is is important

1423
00:55:26,960 --> 00:55:28,820
for us other companies larger financial

1424
00:55:28,820 --> 00:55:30,020
institutions for the most right year

1425
00:55:30,020 --> 00:55:32,180
focus more on policy and compliance and

1426
00:55:32,180 --> 00:55:34,910
and may not be as technical I think I'd

1427
00:55:34,910 --> 00:55:36,710
argue against that but you know there's

1428
00:55:36,710 --> 00:55:38,450
there's a finite number of folks that

1429
00:55:38,450 --> 00:55:41,000
have the skills but I think hiring of

1430
00:55:41,000 --> 00:55:43,970
developers specifically for security has

1431
00:55:43,970 --> 00:55:47,550
exploded of late for sure

1432
00:55:47,550 --> 00:55:49,770
I totally agree with all that I think

1433
00:55:49,770 --> 00:55:51,930
another thing in terms of just if you

1434
00:55:51,930 --> 00:55:53,340
already have a company with an existing

1435
00:55:53,340 --> 00:55:56,190
team and the existing team I doesn't

1436
00:55:56,190 --> 00:55:57,630
have that technical background I think

1437
00:55:57,630 --> 00:55:59,910
you can do things to try to change the

1438
00:55:59,910 --> 00:56:02,310
culture of the team where maybe you can

1439
00:56:02,310 --> 00:56:04,230
get approval that people are allowed to

1440
00:56:04,230 --> 00:56:06,270
attend you know one or two conferences a

1441
00:56:06,270 --> 00:56:09,620
year you know buy a number of books

1442
00:56:09,620 --> 00:56:12,440
maybe that are shared amongst the team

1443
00:56:12,440 --> 00:56:17,880
or you know have like a like a reading

1444
00:56:17,880 --> 00:56:18,900
group or something you know a study

1445
00:56:18,900 --> 00:56:20,580
group where you actually say hey we're

1446
00:56:20,580 --> 00:56:23,370
all gonna you know learn about the

1447
00:56:23,370 --> 00:56:25,710
latest in web app security this month

1448
00:56:25,710 --> 00:56:27,930
right and do kind of themes like that

1449
00:56:27,930 --> 00:56:30,540
just having that culture of learning in

1450
00:56:30,540 --> 00:56:32,580
your team I think can go a really long

1451
00:56:32,580 --> 00:56:34,320
way over time like of course it'll take

1452
00:56:34,320 --> 00:56:36,420
some time to see those returns but it's

1453
00:56:36,420 --> 00:56:39,500
gonna have a huge impact I think it's

1454
00:56:39,500 --> 00:56:42,660
important to remember that as security

1455
00:56:42,660 --> 00:56:44,970
teams we almost have to be an expert in

1456
00:56:44,970 --> 00:56:47,280
such a wide range of topics as a

1457
00:56:47,280 --> 00:56:49,110
software engineer you might be front-end

1458
00:56:49,110 --> 00:56:51,840
back-end or historically you would have

1459
00:56:51,840 --> 00:56:54,600
DBAs or in linux engineers or window

1460
00:56:54,600 --> 00:56:56,610
engineer whatever and I think as a

1461
00:56:56,610 --> 00:56:58,500
security team sometimes the perspective

1462
00:56:58,500 --> 00:57:00,690
of your team is that especially for app

1463
00:57:00,690 --> 00:57:02,190
set people right you need to be able to

1464
00:57:02,190 --> 00:57:03,780
answer a question on such a wide range

1465
00:57:03,780 --> 00:57:06,330
of topics and your engineers expect you

1466
00:57:06,330 --> 00:57:10,230
to be like not like a mile wide and an

1467
00:57:10,230 --> 00:57:11,550
inch deep right they expect you to be a

1468
00:57:11,550 --> 00:57:13,200
mile wide and a mile deep Ennis it's

1469
00:57:13,200 --> 00:57:14,760
incredibly challenging and so I think

1470
00:57:14,760 --> 00:57:17,760
has leaders in your security teams you

1471
00:57:17,760 --> 00:57:19,590
should recognize the amount of pressure

1472
00:57:19,590 --> 00:57:21,300
there might be on your people and

1473
00:57:21,300 --> 00:57:23,460
investing in training and having that

1474
00:57:23,460 --> 00:57:25,110
support is really important but I also

1475
00:57:25,110 --> 00:57:27,810
think it's fine to to make sure that

1476
00:57:27,810 --> 00:57:31,500
that culture is is more pervasive over

1477
00:57:31,500 --> 00:57:33,120
the whole of your environment so that

1478
00:57:33,120 --> 00:57:36,480
it's okay for people to say and I don't

1479
00:57:36,480 --> 00:57:40,050
know but I'll find out how or one of my

1480
00:57:40,050 --> 00:57:42,210
favorites there and in my old team I had

1481
00:57:42,210 --> 00:57:44,160
had a career switcher who came from

1482
00:57:44,160 --> 00:57:46,890
Nestle it sold coffee great because she

1483
00:57:46,890 --> 00:57:49,210
brought in coffee samples all the time

1484
00:57:49,210 --> 00:57:50,829
switched into security engineering

1485
00:57:50,829 --> 00:57:52,710
because that's what she wanted to do and

1486
00:57:52,710 --> 00:57:56,200
she used to say let me take that away

1487
00:57:56,200 --> 00:57:59,290
for you and you know I mean it's little

1488
00:57:59,290 --> 00:58:00,460
things of empowering people with these

1489
00:58:00,460 --> 00:58:02,130
lines to say but what it meant was that

1490
00:58:02,130 --> 00:58:04,569
we then took time to say okay how do we

1491
00:58:04,569 --> 00:58:07,089
kind of upskill in the right areas and

1492
00:58:07,089 --> 00:58:09,040
how do we know what to go after so that

1493
00:58:09,040 --> 00:58:11,079
kind of my dream was we would then be

1494
00:58:11,079 --> 00:58:13,359
the team that when tech come along or a

1495
00:58:13,359 --> 00:58:15,640
CIO come along and say we want to do X

1496
00:58:15,640 --> 00:58:17,740
this crazy thing we believe that's great

1497
00:58:17,740 --> 00:58:19,089
we've already done some research and

1498
00:58:19,089 --> 00:58:20,950
we've been playing around and so

1499
00:58:20,950 --> 00:58:23,920
actually it's been about teaching pre

1500
00:58:23,920 --> 00:58:25,359
and I've been very lucky to have

1501
00:58:25,359 --> 00:58:26,710
previously says that were all about

1502
00:58:26,710 --> 00:58:29,170
engineering and learning but it's been

1503
00:58:29,170 --> 00:58:30,819
about kind of bringing other leaders on

1504
00:58:30,819 --> 00:58:33,099
the journey they say actually 10% time

1505
00:58:33,099 --> 00:58:34,750
or an afternoon time to build stuff is

1506
00:58:34,750 --> 00:58:37,030
actually hugely powerful and in the

1507
00:58:37,030 --> 00:58:38,500
robots team with our career switcher

1508
00:58:38,500 --> 00:58:40,089
we've been working on building a Python

1509
00:58:40,089 --> 00:58:42,220
flash web app that ultimately it's gonna

1510
00:58:42,220 --> 00:58:44,589
and just be a one-stop shop for

1511
00:58:44,589 --> 00:58:46,119
engineers to come to so if something

1512
00:58:46,119 --> 00:58:47,710
could provide value but helps us bring

1513
00:58:47,710 --> 00:58:49,540
up his engineering skills she built her

1514
00:58:49,540 --> 00:58:52,329
first API last week and but when we were

1515
00:58:52,329 --> 00:58:54,160
in a threat model with another team she

1516
00:58:54,160 --> 00:58:55,540
started asking questions around the

1517
00:58:55,540 --> 00:58:57,339
security of certain features that API

1518
00:58:57,339 --> 00:58:59,049
and it's things that she wouldn't have

1519
00:58:59,049 --> 00:59:00,579
easily been able to pick up from just

1520
00:59:00,579 --> 00:59:01,930
listening to a talk it's only from

1521
00:59:01,930 --> 00:59:04,450
building and so empowering and giving

1522
00:59:04,450 --> 00:59:05,980
people confidence to say first of all I

1523
00:59:05,980 --> 00:59:07,450
don't know how to do something it's fine

1524
00:59:07,450 --> 00:59:09,460
but also then giving them the freedom

1525
00:59:09,460 --> 00:59:11,710
and time to explore knowing that it

1526
00:59:11,710 --> 00:59:13,180
makes them a better security engineer is

1527
00:59:13,180 --> 00:59:15,670
really important it's hard to do that

1528
00:59:15,670 --> 00:59:17,589
like at the moment we're Ennis there's a

1529
00:59:17,589 --> 00:59:19,240
team of one but previously I with the

1530
00:59:19,240 --> 00:59:21,040
team of three with a much bigger company

1531
00:59:21,040 --> 00:59:25,059
and it was hard to justify to my boss of

1532
00:59:25,059 --> 00:59:27,190
why we needed to take like it really did

1533
00:59:27,190 --> 00:59:28,480
like we did before T five minutes a day

1534
00:59:28,480 --> 00:59:30,490
every day for three months which is a

1535
00:59:30,490 --> 00:59:32,530
lot and we did at the end of day and it

1536
00:59:32,530 --> 00:59:34,569
was it was a big deal to the to my

1537
00:59:34,569 --> 00:59:36,720
bottom of VP to say we need that time

1538
00:59:36,720 --> 00:59:40,059
but the growth that he saw in his team

1539
00:59:40,059 --> 00:59:41,920
because of that was really powerful and

1540
00:59:41,920 --> 00:59:44,230
now she is an exceptional engineer and

1541
00:59:44,230 --> 00:59:47,619
is for me it's hard to justify that

1542
00:59:47,619 --> 00:59:49,569
career switch is really powerful and for

1543
00:59:49,569 --> 00:59:51,099
her but because we allow her to invest

1544
00:59:51,099 --> 00:59:52,869
that time but I think we also have to be

1545
00:59:52,869 --> 00:59:53,210
kind

1546
00:59:53,210 --> 00:59:55,070
to ourselves right we're expected to be

1547
00:59:55,070 --> 00:59:58,610
a master of many things and security the

1548
00:59:58,610 --> 01:00:00,620
technology itself moves so fast and just

1549
01:00:00,620 --> 01:00:02,570
being kind to ourselves on each other is

1550
01:00:02,570 --> 01:00:05,570
really important but you have to bite

1551
01:00:05,570 --> 01:00:07,010
the bullet and invest that time whether

1552
01:00:07,010 --> 01:00:08,720
it's on free stuff or paid stuff you

1553
01:00:08,720 --> 01:00:11,930
just got to do it I'd say one quick

1554
01:00:11,930 --> 01:00:13,550
twist on on some of this too especially

1555
01:00:13,550 --> 01:00:17,750
in injecting kind of technology

1556
01:00:17,750 --> 01:00:19,910
understanding into the security team is

1557
01:00:19,910 --> 01:00:22,370
make internal hires from here so

1558
01:00:22,370 --> 01:00:24,830
absolutely in addition to all of this

1559
01:00:24,830 --> 01:00:26,900
bit of training up folks very switching

1560
01:00:26,900 --> 01:00:28,970
like all that the best hires I've ever

1561
01:00:28,970 --> 01:00:30,770
made in any of my security groups or

1562
01:00:30,770 --> 01:00:33,140
internal engineers and DevOps folks

1563
01:00:33,140 --> 01:00:36,530
because you can teach them security and

1564
01:00:36,530 --> 01:00:37,970
the amount of time you have to invest

1565
01:00:37,970 --> 01:00:41,030
that is way lower than having to do the

1566
01:00:41,030 --> 01:00:44,120
reverse and most importantly they

1567
01:00:44,120 --> 01:00:46,970
already have the kind of platform and

1568
01:00:46,970 --> 01:00:48,740
technology understanding of what's used

1569
01:00:48,740 --> 01:00:50,630
there but actually most importantly is

1570
01:00:50,630 --> 01:00:51,350
they already have the political

1571
01:00:51,350 --> 01:00:53,720
relationships with the technology and so

1572
01:00:53,720 --> 01:00:57,530
run internal hiring campaigns from your

1573
01:00:57,530 --> 01:00:59,240
technology teams to bring them onto the

1574
01:00:59,240 --> 01:01:01,220
story team if you want to ask anyone

1575
01:01:01,220 --> 01:01:04,700
about that but down on the front row we

1576
01:01:04,700 --> 01:01:07,070
hired him from developing a software

1577
01:01:07,070 --> 01:01:08,930
engineering team when I was in financial

1578
01:01:08,930 --> 01:01:11,030
services I'm honestly one of the best

1579
01:01:11,030 --> 01:01:12,950
upset choirs we've had because he knew

1580
01:01:12,950 --> 01:01:14,690
really well how teams works there's the

1581
01:01:14,690 --> 01:01:16,220
ICD pipelines he had that relationship

1582
01:01:16,220 --> 01:01:19,340
up but ultimately like we can teach a

1583
01:01:19,340 --> 01:01:20,870
lot of this security stuff but knowing

1584
01:01:20,870 --> 01:01:23,120
that technical knowledge deepen that's

1585
01:01:23,120 --> 01:01:25,580
really hard I want to throw one more

1586
01:01:25,580 --> 01:01:28,550
thing on this I think one thing that can

1587
01:01:28,550 --> 01:01:30,290
also be tricky for a less technical team

1588
01:01:30,290 --> 01:01:33,260
is to even you know know what you don't

1589
01:01:33,260 --> 01:01:36,920
know and to help yourself like force

1590
01:01:36,920 --> 01:01:38,990
it's like a forcing function to answer

1591
01:01:38,990 --> 01:01:43,310
that question is to do what I don't see

1592
01:01:43,310 --> 01:01:45,080
this done very often but I really love

1593
01:01:45,080 --> 01:01:46,790
it as a framework which is like a root

1594
01:01:46,790 --> 01:01:48,650
of trust analysis which is really

1595
01:01:48,650 --> 01:01:49,790
starting from the point of like asking

1596
01:01:49,790 --> 01:01:51,590
yourself a question for this thing or

1597
01:01:51,590 --> 01:01:54,260
whatever it is you know server feature

1598
01:01:54,260 --> 01:01:56,270
or whatever what are all the things that

1599
01:01:56,270 --> 01:01:58,880
have to be secured in order for like for

1600
01:01:58,880 --> 01:02:01,430
it to actually be secure like all what

1601
01:02:01,430 --> 01:02:03,630
are all the layers of the stack right

1602
01:02:03,630 --> 01:02:06,900
that this thing is relying on and that

1603
01:02:06,900 --> 01:02:09,299
will quickly surface things that you

1604
01:02:09,299 --> 01:02:11,819
might not really know how it works but

1605
01:02:11,819 --> 01:02:12,839
you'll know that you don't know how it

1606
01:02:12,839 --> 01:02:15,569
works and then now you have a map of oh

1607
01:02:15,569 --> 01:02:17,549
I know how these you know these upper

1608
01:02:17,549 --> 01:02:19,140
layers work I oh I don't really

1609
01:02:19,140 --> 01:02:23,220
understand how the the OS boots up and

1610
01:02:23,220 --> 01:02:25,950
you know that layer of the security but

1611
01:02:25,950 --> 01:02:27,180
at least you'll know what you don't know

1612
01:02:27,180 --> 01:02:28,470
and you'll have kind of a roadmap for

1613
01:02:28,470 --> 01:02:31,799
yourself that way yeah another potential

1614
01:02:31,799 --> 01:02:34,109
idea maybe let one of the people like

1615
01:02:34,109 --> 01:02:35,940
pair program with a developer for a day

1616
01:02:35,940 --> 01:02:37,460
or for a sprint or to just like

1617
01:02:37,460 --> 01:02:40,950
literally sit next to them and do the

1618
01:02:40,950 --> 01:02:42,119
same sort of programming they do and

1619
01:02:42,119 --> 01:02:43,859
then you can be picking things up

1620
01:02:43,859 --> 01:02:47,339
through osmosis one thing I will note is

1621
01:02:47,339 --> 01:02:50,630
I feel like a lot of the very successful

1622
01:02:50,630 --> 01:02:53,099
modern security teams we're really

1623
01:02:53,099 --> 01:02:55,499
pushing things at the forefront tend to

1624
01:02:55,499 --> 01:02:57,029
have significant development expertise

1625
01:02:57,029 --> 01:02:58,319
as well and are very familiar with the

1626
01:02:58,319 --> 01:03:01,079
technology so that as Doug said you're

1627
01:03:01,079 --> 01:03:03,479
building you know services that

1628
01:03:03,479 --> 01:03:04,979
developers can use secure wrapper

1629
01:03:04,979 --> 01:03:08,329
libraries infrastructure I think that

1630
01:03:08,329 --> 01:03:11,759
you know no offense to the vendors

1631
01:03:11,759 --> 01:03:14,339
externally or internally but I don't

1632
01:03:14,339 --> 01:03:15,479
think you're gonna buy your way to

1633
01:03:15,479 --> 01:03:16,920
security I think there's many things

1634
01:03:16,920 --> 01:03:18,690
that certainly will help but I think

1635
01:03:18,690 --> 01:03:21,599
fundamentally to do a great job at

1636
01:03:21,599 --> 01:03:23,219
eliminating classes of vulnerabilities

1637
01:03:23,219 --> 01:03:27,359
you need internal development experience

1638
01:03:27,359 --> 01:03:29,969
as well cool yeah and I think we had a

1639
01:03:29,969 --> 01:03:32,509
question

1640
01:03:36,850 --> 01:03:39,770
[Music]

1641
01:03:39,770 --> 01:03:43,590
I love this question how do you know

1642
01:03:43,590 --> 01:03:46,800
when you've done enough security and I

1643
01:03:46,800 --> 01:03:48,150
think this is really great because right

1644
01:03:48,150 --> 01:03:51,930
in any suitably complex system you can

1645
01:03:51,930 --> 01:03:54,870
there's always bugs right as long as

1646
01:03:54,870 --> 01:03:56,760
it's not a trivial application then you

1647
01:03:56,760 --> 01:03:58,350
know you could keep investing more

1648
01:03:58,350 --> 01:04:00,480
people more time and you get this point

1649
01:04:00,480 --> 01:04:01,830
of diminishing returns as with anything

1650
01:04:01,830 --> 01:04:05,970
so yeah so in that graph of a security

1651
01:04:05,970 --> 01:04:09,150
investment by ROI what we're done we're

1652
01:04:09,150 --> 01:04:15,990
all good let's go I can start I think a

1653
01:04:15,990 --> 01:04:18,150
big piece of it for me it depends on

1654
01:04:18,150 --> 01:04:20,040
like what is it that your company is

1655
01:04:20,040 --> 01:04:22,140
protecting and then what's the like

1656
01:04:22,140 --> 01:04:24,990
worst case scenario for the company like

1657
01:04:24,990 --> 01:04:26,940
that's a good starting point and then

1658
01:04:26,940 --> 01:04:28,380
there's there's gonna be like helpful

1659
01:04:28,380 --> 01:04:30,390
long discussions and prioritization that

1660
01:04:30,390 --> 01:04:32,670
comes out of that but as a foundational

1661
01:04:32,670 --> 01:04:36,090
thing I think one of the things I

1662
01:04:36,090 --> 01:04:38,430
actually really like about GDP are you

1663
01:04:38,430 --> 01:04:41,070
know regulation is the fact that it puts

1664
01:04:41,070 --> 01:04:42,570
things in the format of I know

1665
01:04:42,570 --> 01:04:47,550
controverts we know please get data and

1666
01:04:47,550 --> 01:04:49,230
the data that you're processing instead

1667
01:04:49,230 --> 01:04:53,630
of like some hypothetical like like

1668
01:04:53,630 --> 01:04:55,980
binary thing black and white like this

1669
01:04:55,980 --> 01:04:57,690
is secure this is not secure it's more

1670
01:04:57,690 --> 01:04:59,430
like it's much more granular right it's

1671
01:04:59,430 --> 01:05:01,890
so big it's like okay this is the most

1672
01:05:01,890 --> 01:05:03,660
important data to protect and it should

1673
01:05:03,660 --> 01:05:05,100
only be lit you know living in these

1674
01:05:05,100 --> 01:05:07,140
places and processes in this way right

1675
01:05:07,140 --> 01:05:10,290
and then this other data over here is it

1676
01:05:10,290 --> 01:05:11,730
still needs to be secure but it's

1677
01:05:11,730 --> 01:05:14,580
literally less important it's you know

1678
01:05:14,580 --> 01:05:16,650
the worst case scenario where that data

1679
01:05:16,650 --> 01:05:19,320
ends up public is not as bad as if this

1680
01:05:19,320 --> 01:05:20,910
other data ends on public on the

1681
01:05:20,910 --> 01:05:22,770
Internet right and so I think that is a

1682
01:05:22,770 --> 01:05:24,300
great starting point for any company to

1683
01:05:24,300 --> 01:05:26,150
have that discussion is to start with a

1684
01:05:26,150 --> 01:05:28,650
data classification framework and put

1685
01:05:28,650 --> 01:05:30,180
things into buckets and it should be

1686
01:05:30,180 --> 01:05:32,040
very simple and easy for literally every

1687
01:05:32,040 --> 01:05:33,330
single employee to understand and it

1688
01:05:33,330 --> 01:05:34,470
should be in your security onboarding

1689
01:05:34,470 --> 01:05:37,830
and that way it's a natural hook into

1690
01:05:37,830 --> 01:05:41,100
those hopefully productive and frequent

1691
01:05:41,100 --> 01:05:42,870
conversations between adding random

1692
01:05:42,870 --> 01:05:44,640
employee in the company engaging with

1693
01:05:44,640 --> 01:05:46,800
the security team saying hey

1694
01:05:46,800 --> 01:05:49,500
I'm doing this project and you know

1695
01:05:49,500 --> 01:05:51,060
could be someone in engineering sales

1696
01:05:51,060 --> 01:05:52,560
design doesn't matter they say hey I

1697
01:05:52,560 --> 01:05:54,540
noticed that this thing we're working on

1698
01:05:54,540 --> 01:05:57,780
deals with you know level three data

1699
01:05:57,780 --> 01:06:00,750
level two data level one data so you

1700
01:06:00,750 --> 01:06:02,250
know I remember from my onboarding I'm

1701
01:06:02,250 --> 01:06:03,720
supposed to talk to you and that's just

1702
01:06:03,720 --> 01:06:05,850
the hook into that conversation so

1703
01:06:05,850 --> 01:06:10,080
doesn't I know that's not like a black

1704
01:06:10,080 --> 01:06:11,430
and white answer to the question but I

1705
01:06:11,430 --> 01:06:14,490
think that's how I would start you know

1706
01:06:14,490 --> 01:06:16,740
I find the first security hire at some

1707
01:06:16,740 --> 01:06:18,840
company in this room that's probably how

1708
01:06:18,840 --> 01:06:21,330
I would start start the whole discussion

1709
01:06:21,330 --> 01:06:23,640
with what people internally I mean take

1710
01:06:23,640 --> 01:06:24,570
you through my train of thought there

1711
01:06:24,570 --> 01:06:26,520
happen really quickly after your your

1712
01:06:26,520 --> 01:06:27,810
questionnaire which was first of all was

1713
01:06:27,810 --> 01:06:29,520
never and then I was like well obviously

1714
01:06:29,520 --> 01:06:31,740
then I would just you'd always be

1715
01:06:31,740 --> 01:06:33,210
focusing on bugs and then I was like

1716
01:06:33,210 --> 01:06:35,700
well if the developers can sleep and

1717
01:06:35,700 --> 01:06:37,860
then I remembered about one time when a

1718
01:06:37,860 --> 01:06:40,560
developer happily told me that GDP I

1719
01:06:40,560 --> 01:06:41,970
wasn't going to affect them because they

1720
01:06:41,970 --> 01:06:43,410
weren't gonna taking any more customer

1721
01:06:43,410 --> 01:06:45,450
data after may 2018 and of course it

1722
01:06:45,450 --> 01:06:50,390
only applies data captured from a 20-18

1723
01:06:50,690 --> 01:06:54,740
[Laughter]

1724
01:06:54,740 --> 01:06:57,630
verse a shion's like that and then kind

1725
01:06:57,630 --> 01:06:59,160
of come back to when things that we're

1726
01:06:59,160 --> 01:07:00,210
doing know which is really similar to

1727
01:07:00,210 --> 01:07:02,400
what Jesse said which is we came up with

1728
01:07:02,400 --> 01:07:05,490
like six or seven questions which was

1729
01:07:05,490 --> 01:07:08,100
are you internet facing what's the type

1730
01:07:08,100 --> 01:07:09,870
of data you're handling are you business

1731
01:07:09,870 --> 01:07:11,130
critical like some really simple

1732
01:07:11,130 --> 01:07:12,840
classification questions and then

1733
01:07:12,840 --> 01:07:14,460
depending on what they answered

1734
01:07:14,460 --> 01:07:17,070
ultimately partially dictates how much I

1735
01:07:17,070 --> 01:07:20,190
care to be really brutally honest about

1736
01:07:20,190 --> 01:07:23,130
it and so then that helps drive for me

1737
01:07:23,130 --> 01:07:25,020
how much time I spend which ultimately

1738
01:07:25,020 --> 01:07:26,940
depends on how many resources I have

1739
01:07:26,940 --> 01:07:29,340
available which could be almost almost

1740
01:07:29,340 --> 01:07:31,410
nothing which is just a hey follow these

1741
01:07:31,410 --> 01:07:34,590
steps our normal sdlc process all the

1742
01:07:34,590 --> 01:07:35,850
way through to we're going to threat

1743
01:07:35,850 --> 01:07:37,710
model we're gonna pen test I want to sit

1744
01:07:37,710 --> 01:07:39,180
and be a part of your sessions or

1745
01:07:39,180 --> 01:07:41,580
whatever it is but I think you have to

1746
01:07:41,580 --> 01:07:44,460
be able to give yourself that release

1747
01:07:44,460 --> 01:07:45,930
and I'm people might disagree and that's

1748
01:07:45,930 --> 01:07:46,380
fine

1749
01:07:46,380 --> 01:07:49,140
so sometimes say I don't care about that

1750
01:07:49,140 --> 01:07:51,090
piece of data right you know do your

1751
01:07:51,090 --> 01:07:53,670
thing just to follow like our policies

1752
01:07:53,670 --> 01:07:56,310
or whatever it is but you go in go

1753
01:07:56,310 --> 01:07:58,410
and make sure you engage on the right

1754
01:07:58,410 --> 01:07:59,610
things because ultimately otherwise

1755
01:07:59,610 --> 01:08:00,600
you're just gonna piss all your

1756
01:08:00,600 --> 01:08:02,280
engineering teams off if you insist

1757
01:08:02,280 --> 01:08:03,570
you're involved in every cop's

1758
01:08:03,570 --> 01:08:08,340
deployment I think I would say my

1759
01:08:08,340 --> 01:08:11,190
official answer would be within without

1760
01:08:11,190 --> 01:08:12,810
coming across like a jerk is that you

1761
01:08:12,810 --> 01:08:14,370
know secure process it's not an end

1762
01:08:14,370 --> 01:08:16,830
state right and that's kind of like yeah

1763
01:08:16,830 --> 01:08:18,450
you you were kind of touching on that as

1764
01:08:18,450 --> 01:08:20,939
well but internally like in my head the

1765
01:08:20,939 --> 01:08:22,529
way I look at it is you know we don't

1766
01:08:22,529 --> 01:08:25,140
get owned by accident you know it's not

1767
01:08:25,140 --> 01:08:27,689
something stupid and preventable s3

1768
01:08:27,689 --> 01:08:29,009
bucket open to the world

1769
01:08:29,009 --> 01:08:32,040
accidentally exposed build machine a

1770
01:08:32,040 --> 01:08:33,450
security group open to the world

1771
01:08:33,450 --> 01:08:35,689
something like that like very easy

1772
01:08:35,689 --> 01:08:38,520
relatively easy things to prevent in

1773
01:08:38,520 --> 01:08:40,529
that and that gets sucked up by

1774
01:08:40,529 --> 01:08:45,000
automated scanners or malicious actors

1775
01:08:45,000 --> 01:08:47,490
of very low sophistication right like

1776
01:08:47,490 --> 01:08:49,649
that's that's how I kind of internalized

1777
01:08:49,649 --> 01:08:58,040
it cool next question yes

1778
01:09:18,569 --> 01:09:20,529
okay that I like that

1779
01:09:20,529 --> 01:09:22,990
so frameworks are getting better

1780
01:09:22,990 --> 01:09:25,240
especially modern ones do a ton of

1781
01:09:25,240 --> 01:09:26,770
security things by default which is

1782
01:09:26,770 --> 01:09:30,359
great but as developers are using them

1783
01:09:30,359 --> 01:09:33,850
just by using the frameworks built in

1784
01:09:33,850 --> 01:09:35,350
features how you're supposed to they're

1785
01:09:35,350 --> 01:09:36,460
getting all these security wins that

1786
01:09:36,460 --> 01:09:38,020
they may not even have to think about

1787
01:09:38,020 --> 01:09:40,210
security anymore do you think that's a

1788
01:09:40,210 --> 01:09:41,859
good thing a bad thing

1789
01:09:41,859 --> 01:09:46,270
neutral yeah that's that's a tough yeah

1790
01:09:46,270 --> 01:09:48,250
I've thought about this a lot as well I

1791
01:09:48,250 --> 01:09:50,770
agree like we have done a lot of work to

1792
01:09:50,770 --> 01:09:52,720
abstract certain security concepts away

1793
01:09:52,720 --> 01:09:54,250
from developers they don't have to think

1794
01:09:54,250 --> 01:09:58,360
about it but you know are we kind of

1795
01:09:58,360 --> 01:10:00,310
training or recent advising kind of the

1796
01:10:00,310 --> 01:10:01,870
bad behavior for not thinking about

1797
01:10:01,870 --> 01:10:05,110
security I think one thing that we have

1798
01:10:05,110 --> 01:10:06,940
had some we have had some success with

1799
01:10:06,940 --> 01:10:08,560
that and that they're using it but one

1800
01:10:08,560 --> 01:10:10,240
thing that I have learned as well is

1801
01:10:10,240 --> 01:10:12,640
that you're dealing with highly

1802
01:10:12,640 --> 01:10:14,440
technical individuals people who are

1803
01:10:14,440 --> 01:10:17,050
like who are creative who are interested

1804
01:10:17,050 --> 01:10:19,210
in how things work and that you know

1805
01:10:19,210 --> 01:10:20,560
very much like security folks except

1806
01:10:20,560 --> 01:10:22,480
they're just focused on on slightly

1807
01:10:22,480 --> 01:10:24,610
different objectives like they don't

1808
01:10:24,610 --> 01:10:26,170
necessarily want a black box like they

1809
01:10:26,170 --> 01:10:27,700
want to know what's work what how it's

1810
01:10:27,700 --> 01:10:30,580
working underneath some may not but some

1811
01:10:30,580 --> 01:10:32,800
you know I think it's been pretty 50/50

1812
01:10:32,800 --> 01:10:34,360
from the developers that we've worked

1813
01:10:34,360 --> 01:10:36,640
with where they're like no well why am i

1814
01:10:36,640 --> 01:10:38,530
calling this one this this function

1815
01:10:38,530 --> 01:10:41,380
instead they want to know and I mean I

1816
01:10:41,380 --> 01:10:43,480
think that's kind of conversation sort

1817
01:10:43,480 --> 01:10:45,640
of thing you have but that's a good

1818
01:10:45,640 --> 01:10:49,900
question I think it's mostly a very good

1819
01:10:49,900 --> 01:10:51,550
thing I would say I think a lot of a

1820
01:10:51,550 --> 01:10:53,830
common pattern that I think all of us

1821
01:10:53,830 --> 01:10:56,170
have seen across companies that are

1822
01:10:56,170 --> 01:10:58,150
doing this well and everybody calls it

1823
01:10:58,150 --> 01:10:59,620
something different it's kind of a paved

1824
01:10:59,620 --> 01:11:01,570
road or a golden path or whatever you

1825
01:11:01,570 --> 01:11:04,720
want to call it of hey if you write code

1826
01:11:04,720 --> 01:11:06,220
or deploy a service or something like

1827
01:11:06,220 --> 01:11:07,930
this following the standard pattern

1828
01:11:07,930 --> 01:11:09,750
there's whole classes of vulnerabilities

1829
01:11:09,750 --> 01:11:12,640
you no longer have to worry about and I

1830
01:11:12,640 --> 01:11:14,530
think that it's I mean that obviously is

1831
01:11:14,530 --> 01:11:17,830
I think really good I think kind of at

1832
01:11:17,830 --> 01:11:19,240
the root of your question of oh do they

1833
01:11:19,240 --> 01:11:21,460
now is them not knowing about those

1834
01:11:21,460 --> 01:11:23,200
vulnerability classes kind of bad should

1835
01:11:23,200 --> 01:11:24,090
they still be away

1836
01:11:24,090 --> 01:11:27,570
of it I think the I'd say in a vacuum I

1837
01:11:27,570 --> 01:11:30,000
think that's that's a totally fair point

1838
01:11:30,000 --> 01:11:31,560
to kind of see back and forth I think in

1839
01:11:31,560 --> 01:11:33,900
reality there's not anyone on the planet

1840
01:11:33,900 --> 01:11:35,640
and who says man there's just a shortage

1841
01:11:35,640 --> 01:11:36,990
of security things to be thinking about

1842
01:11:36,990 --> 01:11:39,000
and to be worried about right there's a

1843
01:11:39,000 --> 01:11:40,950
backlog that everyone in this room could

1844
01:11:40,950 --> 01:11:42,240
work on for the rest of their careers

1845
01:11:42,240 --> 01:11:44,280
and so the more that you can wipe out

1846
01:11:44,280 --> 01:11:46,980
individual vulnerability classes and

1847
01:11:46,980 --> 01:11:49,200
patterns and make things safe by default

1848
01:11:49,200 --> 01:11:52,050
so then you can look for what's opting

1849
01:11:52,050 --> 01:11:54,180
out of those patterns and treat those as

1850
01:11:54,180 --> 01:11:56,340
issues to triage very quickly or other

1851
01:11:56,340 --> 01:11:57,690
things that you can't wipe out with the

1852
01:11:57,690 --> 01:11:58,920
framework that you're gonna need folks

1853
01:11:58,920 --> 01:12:01,950
to be cognizant of and focus on it frees

1854
01:12:01,950 --> 01:12:04,770
up the dangerously few resources that

1855
01:12:04,770 --> 01:12:06,900
you have to focus on more important

1856
01:12:06,900 --> 01:12:07,830
things and that's why I think it's a

1857
01:12:07,830 --> 01:12:10,700
really good thing that's it in general

1858
01:12:10,700 --> 01:12:13,800
yeah I totally agree I think in an ideal

1859
01:12:13,800 --> 01:12:16,320
world developers just going about their

1860
01:12:16,320 --> 01:12:18,420
job using the tools that are provided in

1861
01:12:18,420 --> 01:12:20,700
libraries and everything just like they

1862
01:12:20,700 --> 01:12:22,410
don't think about security it's secure

1863
01:12:22,410 --> 01:12:24,630
they it happens transparency

1864
01:12:24,630 --> 01:12:27,030
transparently right you don't like get

1865
01:12:27,030 --> 01:12:28,590
on an airplane and think like okay I

1866
01:12:28,590 --> 01:12:29,850
need to make sure the wings working

1867
01:12:29,850 --> 01:12:31,920
exactly this way else will crash I need

1868
01:12:31,920 --> 01:12:33,000
to make sure the windows don't blow up

1869
01:12:33,000 --> 01:12:36,510
it like like it just happens yeah so I

1870
01:12:36,510 --> 01:12:38,790
think really what I think we should all

1871
01:12:38,790 --> 01:12:41,280
be fighting for in my opinion is like a

1872
01:12:41,280 --> 01:12:43,200
world where developers can build

1873
01:12:43,200 --> 01:12:45,240
features very quickly and efficiently

1874
01:12:45,240 --> 01:12:47,700
and they don't even think about security

1875
01:12:47,700 --> 01:12:49,200
or even have to know about it but

1876
01:12:49,200 --> 01:12:52,110
because of the as like Netflix so the

1877
01:12:52,110 --> 01:12:53,010
paved road

1878
01:12:53,010 --> 01:12:55,920
everything is just secure and I think to

1879
01:12:55,920 --> 01:13:00,930
get buy-in and to get like adoption of

1880
01:13:00,930 --> 01:13:02,640
all these nice things you build if you

1881
01:13:02,640 --> 01:13:05,160
can build in like useful features like

1882
01:13:05,160 --> 01:13:07,530
perhaps logging monitoring telemetry

1883
01:13:07,530 --> 01:13:09,930
into the security primitives you build

1884
01:13:09,930 --> 01:13:12,270
for development teams then they'll use

1885
01:13:12,270 --> 01:13:14,040
it not just because it's more secure

1886
01:13:14,040 --> 01:13:15,900
which they may be ambivalent about but

1887
01:13:15,900 --> 01:13:17,160
because it gives them things for free

1888
01:13:17,160 --> 01:13:18,840
like oh I was gonna have to spend a

1889
01:13:18,840 --> 01:13:20,040
couple of days building some nice

1890
01:13:20,040 --> 01:13:21,270
logging and monitoring or like

1891
01:13:21,270 --> 01:13:23,250
performance metrics oh but if I use your

1892
01:13:23,250 --> 01:13:26,340
secure XML parsing library I get that

1893
01:13:26,340 --> 01:13:28,710
for free and also xxe is prevented by

1894
01:13:28,710 --> 01:13:31,380
default right I think it's important not

1895
01:13:31,380 --> 01:13:31,950
to allow

1896
01:13:31,950 --> 01:13:34,830
frameworks to breed apathy which is that

1897
01:13:34,830 --> 01:13:38,220
because it's everyone says it's a secure

1898
01:13:38,220 --> 01:13:40,050
rapper I don't have to care about it or

1899
01:13:40,050 --> 01:13:42,360
like all of us I don't no one looks at

1900
01:13:42,360 --> 01:13:43,620
it anymore and I think has secured it

1901
01:13:43,620 --> 01:13:45,600
seems it's easy for us to say they're

1902
01:13:45,600 --> 01:13:48,090
using the secure episode out either and

1903
01:13:48,090 --> 01:13:49,710
so what happens is you end up with a

1904
01:13:49,710 --> 01:13:53,190
system that ages and you know we heard

1905
01:13:53,190 --> 01:13:56,160
from some of our speakers earlier that

1906
01:13:56,160 --> 01:13:59,250
you know as a malicious attacker

1907
01:13:59,250 --> 01:14:02,310
I might go for us an attacker you might

1908
01:14:02,310 --> 01:14:04,050
go for some of these frameworks or some

1909
01:14:04,050 --> 01:14:05,850
of these platforms because then it's a

1910
01:14:05,850 --> 01:14:08,130
great point of compromise right so I

1911
01:14:08,130 --> 01:14:09,960
just you know the one thing I would say

1912
01:14:09,960 --> 01:14:11,220
with that you want engineers to feel

1913
01:14:11,220 --> 01:14:13,740
like they can develop securely by

1914
01:14:13,740 --> 01:14:15,660
default and have those guidance but you

1915
01:14:15,660 --> 01:14:18,690
don't want it to breed apathy and so you

1916
01:14:18,690 --> 01:14:20,370
know at the same time I'm not going to

1917
01:14:20,370 --> 01:14:21,360
say they have to learn about all the

1918
01:14:21,360 --> 01:14:22,860
things that could go wrong but I do want

1919
01:14:22,860 --> 01:14:24,270
them to care that things could go wrong

1920
01:14:24,270 --> 01:14:27,930
and still kind of look at whatever it is

1921
01:14:27,930 --> 01:14:29,430
that they're using that framework with

1922
01:14:29,430 --> 01:14:32,340
just that teeny bit of paranoia and

1923
01:14:32,340 --> 01:14:33,900
putting in case something might go wrong

1924
01:14:33,900 --> 01:14:38,820
I like it more questions maybe from the

1925
01:14:38,820 --> 01:14:40,920
back I don't think we've had questions

1926
01:14:40,920 --> 01:14:43,590
from back there yet you can see back I

1927
01:14:43,590 --> 01:14:49,770
can't but we can pretend or from

1928
01:14:49,770 --> 01:14:52,220
anywhere

1929
01:15:27,030 --> 01:15:31,800
I can repeat that just to make sure do

1930
01:15:31,800 --> 01:15:34,320
you think incentives are important for

1931
01:15:34,320 --> 01:15:37,320
upper and middle management so that they

1932
01:15:37,320 --> 01:15:44,970
don't ignore things and okay for making

1933
01:15:44,970 --> 01:15:46,980
impactful organizational change for the

1934
01:15:46,980 --> 01:15:51,780
better for security I guess yeah our

1935
01:15:51,780 --> 01:15:53,610
incentives important for those middle

1936
01:15:53,610 --> 01:15:56,220
and upper management and it's so what

1937
01:15:56,220 --> 01:15:58,440
are some good ones or how do we how do

1938
01:15:58,440 --> 01:16:00,600
we make it happen they they they are

1939
01:16:00,600 --> 01:16:03,150
they shouldn't be that should just be

1940
01:16:03,150 --> 01:16:05,490
part of their own ways of working right

1941
01:16:05,490 --> 01:16:08,880
but they are I'm their most powerful

1942
01:16:08,880 --> 01:16:11,190
when and the right this is such a soft

1943
01:16:11,190 --> 01:16:13,500
skill thing to say I don't really want

1944
01:16:13,500 --> 01:16:15,540
to be the one to say it and feedback is

1945
01:16:15,540 --> 01:16:18,750
really important but actually feedback

1946
01:16:18,750 --> 01:16:21,480
really is and I found that written

1947
01:16:21,480 --> 01:16:23,340
feedback but like time in a place for

1948
01:16:23,340 --> 01:16:25,800
your back bit and and rel well-written

1949
01:16:25,800 --> 01:16:28,260
with like examples it's been it's

1950
01:16:28,260 --> 01:16:29,550
actually been really powerful and not

1951
01:16:29,550 --> 01:16:31,740
just to the individual but like I don't

1952
01:16:31,740 --> 01:16:33,240
wanna be like I make examples of people

1953
01:16:33,240 --> 01:16:40,890
but you crossed me it's very good giving

1954
01:16:40,890 --> 01:16:43,830
example as a feedback in and really

1955
01:16:43,830 --> 01:16:45,000
taking the time to have that

1956
01:16:45,000 --> 01:16:46,380
conversation with people I found has

1957
01:16:46,380 --> 01:16:48,510
been really helpful and kind of giving

1958
01:16:48,510 --> 01:16:50,490
that incentive especially when you have

1959
01:16:50,490 --> 01:16:52,140
big corporate organizations they want to

1960
01:16:52,140 --> 01:16:55,410
do 365 feedback or end of year mid-year

1961
01:16:55,410 --> 01:16:57,120
actually it becomes really powerful

1962
01:16:57,120 --> 01:17:00,150
especially if you can get your senior

1963
01:17:00,150 --> 01:17:01,950
leadership and security to do it for you

1964
01:17:01,950 --> 01:17:03,990
if you say hey we are gonna commit to

1965
01:17:03,990 --> 01:17:06,120
giving you feedback in return for being

1966
01:17:06,120 --> 01:17:09,060
a security champion or whatever and I

1967
01:17:09,060 --> 01:17:10,770
found that to actually work surprisingly

1968
01:17:10,770 --> 01:17:12,840
and it doesn't cost me anything from a

1969
01:17:12,840 --> 01:17:16,020
budget perspective yeah I know what you

1970
01:17:16,020 --> 01:17:18,690
guys think yeah I'd say you know our is

1971
01:17:18,690 --> 01:17:22,410
our incentives important absolutely like

1972
01:17:22,410 --> 01:17:25,650
100 percent yes but it's just that when

1973
01:17:25,650 --> 01:17:27,120
you say the word incentives people's

1974
01:17:27,120 --> 01:17:29,310
mind tends to go to financial right and

1975
01:17:29,310 --> 01:17:31,320
so our incentives important absolutely

1976
01:17:31,320 --> 01:17:33,920
as a bucket term it's just that

1977
01:17:33,920 --> 01:17:36,630
incentive an actual incentive is going

1978
01:17:36,630 --> 01:17:37,810
to be context dependent on

1979
01:17:37,810 --> 01:17:41,110
organization now in some companies I can

1980
01:17:41,110 --> 01:17:42,520
think of like a few different super

1981
01:17:42,520 --> 01:17:44,470
bleeding-edge tech ones it's someone

1982
01:17:44,470 --> 01:17:46,210
will get a shout out in the company

1983
01:17:46,210 --> 01:17:47,590
slack channel when they've done

1984
01:17:47,590 --> 01:17:49,690
something you know very mindful about

1985
01:17:49,690 --> 01:17:51,700
security and that's the incentive right

1986
01:17:51,700 --> 01:17:54,460
in others seen seen certainly ones where

1987
01:17:54,460 --> 01:17:56,950
financial performance you know end of

1988
01:17:56,950 --> 01:17:59,500
your bonus really financial services for

1989
01:17:59,500 --> 01:18:01,360
the most part like part of your bonus

1990
01:18:01,360 --> 01:18:03,790
multiplier might get tied to some sort

1991
01:18:03,790 --> 01:18:05,410
of security thing so it I think I've

1992
01:18:05,410 --> 01:18:07,780
seen it every end of the spectrum there

1993
01:18:07,780 --> 01:18:10,840
from financial to just social and I

1994
01:18:10,840 --> 01:18:12,670
think the reality is for organizations

1995
01:18:12,670 --> 01:18:14,920
it's gonna it falls somewhere in the

1996
01:18:14,920 --> 01:18:17,650
middle and finding the right one for

1997
01:18:17,650 --> 01:18:18,910
your organization I think it's a super

1998
01:18:18,910 --> 01:18:22,690
important then the right menu for your

1999
01:18:22,690 --> 01:18:26,440
organization okay so I think we are

2000
01:18:26,440 --> 01:18:28,840
close to wrapping up time so just

2001
01:18:28,840 --> 01:18:31,240
quickly and perhaps like one or two

2002
01:18:31,240 --> 01:18:34,510
sentences if there is one thing you

2003
01:18:34,510 --> 01:18:35,980
would like to leave people with or

2004
01:18:35,980 --> 01:18:38,470
perhaps like a most impactful lesson

2005
01:18:38,470 --> 01:18:40,120
learn or something like that you would

2006
01:18:40,120 --> 01:18:42,430
like to leave everyone with I leave you

2007
01:18:42,430 --> 01:18:49,720
that opportunity now discriminate would

2008
01:18:49,720 --> 01:18:51,220
be the one thing that I've learned it

2009
01:18:51,220 --> 01:18:52,690
doesn't matter what size of business you

2010
01:18:52,690 --> 01:18:54,550
are how experienced do you think you are

2011
01:18:54,550 --> 01:18:57,520
your team is or how much money you spend

2012
01:18:57,520 --> 01:18:58,830
or how big your budget is

2013
01:18:58,830 --> 01:19:00,820
vulnerabilities don't discriminate and

2014
01:19:00,820 --> 01:19:02,770
you could be vulnerable to this anything

2015
01:19:02,770 --> 01:19:04,420
a big financial services could be or you

2016
01:19:04,420 --> 01:19:05,980
could be much better at protecting

2017
01:19:05,980 --> 01:19:07,690
against it and so you have to be really

2018
01:19:07,690 --> 01:19:10,330
mindful of what your your risk landscape

2019
01:19:10,330 --> 01:19:12,400
is not what everyone else's risk

2020
01:19:12,400 --> 01:19:16,270
landscape this it's a the one thing that

2021
01:19:16,270 --> 01:19:18,300
the one lesson I had to learn very

2022
01:19:18,300 --> 01:19:20,410
painfully early on from Etsy is that

2023
01:19:20,410 --> 01:19:23,320
this shift to DevOps cloud def Cyclops

2024
01:19:23,320 --> 01:19:25,090
all this the number one theme of this is

2025
01:19:25,090 --> 01:19:27,880
security focuses and it's very cliche

2026
01:19:27,880 --> 01:19:29,350
when you you say now but I think it's

2027
01:19:29,350 --> 01:19:31,300
the single most important theme security

2028
01:19:31,300 --> 01:19:33,580
has to focus on enabling the rest of the

2029
01:19:33,580 --> 01:19:34,960
business to move at the speed that it

2030
01:19:34,960 --> 01:19:36,700
wants to I think that the story from

2031
01:19:36,700 --> 01:19:39,100
before is kind of the painful example of

2032
01:19:39,100 --> 01:19:40,420
well then scary just gets routed around

2033
01:19:40,420 --> 01:19:42,130
and they don't tell security about the

2034
01:19:42,130 --> 01:19:45,190
50 apps in the cloud but I'd say the one

2035
01:19:45,190 --> 01:19:47,140
theme to guide your work whether you're

2036
01:19:47,140 --> 01:19:48,570
on the scary side whether on the demo

2037
01:19:48,570 --> 01:19:51,360
Elmen side is don't be thinking about

2038
01:19:51,360 --> 01:19:52,890
security as that old sort of gatekeeping

2039
01:19:52,890 --> 01:19:55,140
mentality if it is it's not gonna be

2040
01:19:55,140 --> 01:19:57,090
successful focus on how it can enable

2041
01:19:57,090 --> 01:19:59,310
you to move at the speed that you want

2042
01:19:59,310 --> 01:20:01,050
to move at and that shakes out a lot of

2043
01:20:01,050 --> 01:20:02,640
cultural stuff and shakes out a lot of

2044
01:20:02,640 --> 01:20:07,140
technical stuff I think something that

2045
01:20:07,140 --> 01:20:08,520
actually dovetails really nicely on that

2046
01:20:08,520 --> 01:20:11,370
is making things secure by design as

2047
01:20:11,370 --> 01:20:15,030
much as possible across the stack will

2048
01:20:15,030 --> 01:20:17,070
enable that it will enable a faster you

2049
01:20:17,070 --> 01:20:18,330
know business velocity faster

2050
01:20:18,330 --> 01:20:20,640
engineering velocity everyone will be

2051
01:20:20,640 --> 01:20:22,050
happier and you'll be more secure so

2052
01:20:22,050 --> 01:20:24,050
like any time you have that opportunity

2053
01:20:24,050 --> 01:20:28,380
take it yeah I would say don't be a

2054
01:20:28,380 --> 01:20:30,360
blend of dump - exactly you know like

2055
01:20:30,360 --> 01:20:33,450
don't be a blocker the build versus buy

2056
01:20:33,450 --> 01:20:34,980
argument I think is a strong one you

2057
01:20:34,980 --> 01:20:37,470
know don't you know delude yourself

2058
01:20:37,470 --> 01:20:39,450
there right like I'm I'm not gonna build

2059
01:20:39,450 --> 01:20:44,070
a laugh right I'm gonna buy it one if it

2060
01:20:44,070 --> 01:20:46,200
might be a next-generation if I were to

2061
01:20:46,200 --> 01:20:51,960
do very basic example but that it's the

2062
01:20:51,960 --> 01:20:54,150
build versus buys is is a very important

2063
01:20:54,150 --> 01:20:55,980
thing especially you know again to your

2064
01:20:55,980 --> 01:20:57,420
point about having developers on the on

2065
01:20:57,420 --> 01:20:59,790
the staff like you you have to stop

2066
01:20:59,790 --> 01:21:01,110
yourself from taking on too many

2067
01:21:01,110 --> 01:21:04,950
projects sometimes and also I don't like

2068
01:21:04,950 --> 01:21:06,570
using the word like people problem but

2069
01:21:06,570 --> 01:21:08,160
like you know it's about relationships

2070
01:21:08,160 --> 01:21:10,140
it's about working with people in other

2071
01:21:10,140 --> 01:21:13,110
teams and that's you know we've been

2072
01:21:13,110 --> 01:21:14,460
like peaks and valleys with that you

2073
01:21:14,460 --> 01:21:15,840
know learned our lesson a few few

2074
01:21:15,840 --> 01:21:17,610
different times as far as interacting

2075
01:21:17,610 --> 01:21:19,710
with other teams and listening to their

2076
01:21:19,710 --> 01:21:21,270
needs and communicating with them

2077
01:21:21,270 --> 01:21:22,920
properly and there's a big difference

2078
01:21:22,920 --> 01:21:24,540
I've learned that there between

2079
01:21:24,540 --> 01:21:26,910
communication and understanding you

2080
01:21:26,910 --> 01:21:28,710
communicate quite a bit but if they're

2081
01:21:28,710 --> 01:21:29,760
not picking up what you're putting down

2082
01:21:29,760 --> 01:21:34,010
it you know can can create issues so I

2083
01:21:34,010 --> 01:21:37,320
think all right well thank you so much

2084
01:21:37,320 --> 01:21:39,510
for your time if you like content like

2085
01:21:39,510 --> 01:21:41,760
this and want to care about other modern

2086
01:21:41,760 --> 01:21:44,370
security research that's going on feel

2087
01:21:44,370 --> 01:21:46,280
free to check out the free newsletter

2088
01:21:46,280 --> 01:21:48,440
but yeah thank you so much for attending

2089
01:21:48,440 --> 01:21:50,310

2090
01:21:50,310 --> 01:21:51,960
conference will be around tonight and
