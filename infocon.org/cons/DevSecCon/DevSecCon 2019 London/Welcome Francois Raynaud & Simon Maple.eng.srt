amount of work in the last in the last

23
00:00:56,730 --> 00:01:00,030
week or so it's what I invite Tami up on

24
00:01:00,030 --> 00:01:01,829
stage just to give let's give time a

25
00:01:01,829 --> 00:01:09,409
massive round of applause because thanks

26
00:01:09,409 --> 00:01:11,719
because if it wasn't for Tammy then then

27
00:01:11,719 --> 00:01:13,369
we literally wouldn't be here today so

28
00:01:13,369 --> 00:01:14,240
yeah

29
00:01:14,240 --> 00:01:21,380
massive Tammy cool has been a long way

30
00:01:21,380 --> 00:01:24,469
so there's a few of you that we're here

31
00:01:24,469 --> 00:01:28,000
in London in when was it was in October

32
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:31,970
2015 the restart it was just like 120 of

33
00:01:31,970 --> 00:01:39,439
us and then we've grown we started

34
00:01:39,439 --> 00:01:41,270
putting review committee together

35
00:01:41,270 --> 00:01:43,179
increasing the quality of the line

36
00:01:43,179 --> 00:01:45,649
basically just making sure it's not me

37
00:01:45,649 --> 00:01:47,630
deciding what is the best tool so now

38
00:01:47,630 --> 00:01:49,880
we've got so there is - which is here

39
00:01:49,880 --> 00:01:52,520
there's seven over the other ones they

40
00:01:52,520 --> 00:01:53,810
spread around the world so we could not

41
00:01:53,810 --> 00:01:56,149
actually get them today but without them

42
00:01:56,149 --> 00:02:00,049
we wouldn't be here today they we kept

43
00:02:00,049 --> 00:02:02,810
growing we went to Singapore we went to

44
00:02:02,810 --> 00:02:04,759
Seattle went to Boston we went to Tel

45
00:02:04,759 --> 00:02:07,369
Aviv there's more locations to be

46
00:02:07,369 --> 00:02:09,860
announced this year and we got acquired

47
00:02:09,860 --> 00:02:13,040
by snick which is really good saying if

48
00:02:13,040 --> 00:02:14,900
you think about it this conference today

49
00:02:14,900 --> 00:02:17,209
wouldn't have happened if snick wasn't

50
00:02:17,209 --> 00:02:18,650
here to provide all the logistical

51
00:02:18,650 --> 00:02:21,290
support so I'd like to personally say

52
00:02:21,290 --> 00:02:22,760
thank you just Nick Thank You Simon

53
00:02:22,760 --> 00:02:24,829
Thank You Tammy thank you everybody

54
00:02:24,829 --> 00:02:27,700
this is the reason why we're here today

55
00:02:27,700 --> 00:02:32,600
so thank you so so yeah in terms of what

56
00:02:32,600 --> 00:02:34,609
you know one of the what we will kind of

57
00:02:34,609 --> 00:02:36,470
want to do with with deficit Cohn in

58
00:02:36,470 --> 00:02:38,989
terms of snick being stewards first of

59
00:02:38,989 --> 00:02:40,549
all the first and foremost we want to

60
00:02:40,549 --> 00:02:42,440
maintain the vendor neutrality so you'll

61
00:02:42,440 --> 00:02:46,130
see Snickers here as a vendor it as a

62
00:02:46,130 --> 00:02:48,049
sponsor but you won't see snick anywhere

63
00:02:48,049 --> 00:02:50,389
else we won't see you actually snip lots

64
00:02:50,389 --> 00:02:52,819
of sneak people on the on the committee

65
00:02:52,819 --> 00:02:54,590
for the CFP or anything like that we're

66
00:02:54,590 --> 00:02:56,269
maintaining a vendor neutral feel to the

67
00:02:56,269 --> 00:02:57,859
whole conference what we do want to do

68
00:02:57,859 --> 00:03:00,319
though is its continued the great work

69
00:03:00,319 --> 00:03:02,359
that Francois has done in making

70
00:03:02,359 --> 00:03:03,739

111
00:04:35,840 --> 00:04:37,759
a workshop track which is located in the

112
00:04:37,759 --> 00:04:40,280
mezzanine so in years room you can

113
00:04:40,280 --> 00:04:41,690
actually just take the stairs and that's

114
00:04:41,690 --> 00:04:43,070
where the workshops will take place and

115
00:04:43,070 --> 00:04:45,410
all the to speaker track is going to

116
00:04:45,410 --> 00:04:48,169
take place here one thing not to forget

117
00:04:48,169 --> 00:04:52,340
is we've got our 5th birthday party this

118
00:04:52,340 --> 00:04:54,199
year and I had something to say that I

119
00:04:54,199 --> 00:04:56,979
completely forgot we wanted to call out

120
00:04:56,979 --> 00:05:00,229
yes there's two people in the room there

121
00:05:00,229 --> 00:05:02,300
was one person that bought the first

122
00:05:02,300 --> 00:05:04,580
ticket for every conference and as Tony

123
00:05:04,580 --> 00:05:08,270

00:05:13,130 --> 00:05:16,699
aunty Ghulam but and those two people

127
00:05:16,699 --> 00:05:18,680
actually always make me feel really

128
00:05:18,680 --> 00:05:20,210
great about the conference because I

129
00:05:20,210 --> 00:05:21,319

130
00:05:21,319 --> 00:05:22,970

without our sponsors so we've got at

245
00:10:04,750 --> 00:10:06,700

bringing the seven together and we also

253
00:10:21,100 --> 00:10:23,230
have everyone should have a sponsor

254
00:10:23,230 --> 00:10:25,030
passport and the idea the sponsor

255
00:10:25,030 --> 00:10:26,710
passport is when you go to see either

256
00:10:26,710 --> 00:10:29,170
the platinum sponsors which is f5 and

257
00:10:29,170 --> 00:10:31,870
snick or our gold sponsors J frog Stoker

258
00:10:31,870 --> 00:10:33,370
code where a hacker warren vera code and

259
00:10:33,370 --> 00:10:35,830
sona tight they can stamp your passport

260
00:10:35,830 --> 00:10:38,470
so they'll stamp the relevant box once

261
00:10:38,470 --> 00:10:40,720
you have all of those boxes stamped make

262
00:10:40,720 --> 00:10:42,340
sure you fill in your name and give that

263
00:10:42,340 --> 00:10:44,890
passport back to the registration desk

264
00:10:44,890 --> 00:10:48,100
on the closing of the conference we will

265
00:10:48,100 --> 00:10:50,560

266
00:10:50,560 --> 00:10:52,720
and you have to be here to win one of

267
00:10:52,720 --> 00:10:56,830
three ipads so that's a nice a nice kind

268
00:10:56,830 --> 00:10:58,540
of encouragement to go to the sponsors

269
00:10:58,540 --> 00:11:01,420
you don't have any QR codes so we no one

270
00:11:01,420 --> 00:11:02,800
can scan your badges

271
00:11:02,800 --> 00:11:04,390
but if you have a good conversation with

272
00:11:04,390 --> 00:11:05,590
one of the sponsors and you want to

273
00:11:05,590 --> 00:11:07,900

00:11:16,180 --> 00:11:19,090
the code of conduct so that's been in

278
00:11:19,090 --> 00:11:20,860
place since the first deaf sitcom we

279
