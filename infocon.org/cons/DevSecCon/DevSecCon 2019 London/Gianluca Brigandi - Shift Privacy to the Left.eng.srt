1
00:00:09,660 --> 00:00:14,460
everyone if you want to start making

2
00:00:14,460 --> 00:00:16,410
questions and you feel more comfortable

3
00:00:16,410 --> 00:00:19,980
using a mobile so you can you can use

4
00:00:19,980 --> 00:00:22,980
slider which is pretty cool so just feel

5
00:00:22,980 --> 00:00:27,239
free to to do any questions or you know

6
00:00:27,239 --> 00:00:28,650
we're gonna have a Q&A session

7
00:00:28,650 --> 00:00:31,230
afterwards but if you feel more

8
00:00:31,230 --> 00:00:33,270
comfortable just you know you have to

9
00:00:33,270 --> 00:00:36,140
just connect to the website slider comm

10
00:00:36,140 --> 00:00:39,530
pbd which is privacy by design is the

11
00:00:39,530 --> 00:00:45,030
the key word for accessing the the this

12
00:00:45,030 --> 00:00:50,630
specific talk okay okay so let me switch

13
00:00:50,630 --> 00:00:53,900
let's go

14
00:00:55,430 --> 00:00:58,330
okay now

15
00:00:59,160 --> 00:01:02,550
this is gonna be interesting think talk

16
00:01:02,550 --> 00:01:08,170
I'm gonna kind of introduce somehow what

17
00:01:08,170 --> 00:01:12,340
machine learning can do for privacy

18
00:01:12,340 --> 00:01:17,250
I see privacy as a sort of extension of

19
00:01:17,250 --> 00:01:21,490
security I think they're not different

20
00:01:21,490 --> 00:01:24,310
concepts are very related so I'm gonna

21
00:01:24,310 --> 00:01:28,210
try to you know explore pretty much what

22
00:01:28,210 --> 00:01:30,670
what is privacy from the applications

23
00:01:30,670 --> 00:01:33,970
SEC perspective so which is typically

24
00:01:33,970 --> 00:01:35,290
called privacy by design

25
00:01:35,290 --> 00:01:37,479
okay so just if you feel free to

26
00:01:37,479 --> 00:01:39,490
interrupt me just raise your hand you

27
00:01:39,490 --> 00:01:41,259
know let's let's make it you know kind

28
00:01:41,259 --> 00:01:46,300
of to weigh as much as possible okay so

29
00:01:46,300 --> 00:01:49,090
let me see if this works I'm gonna try

30
00:01:49,090 --> 00:01:55,770
using this device just one sec okay okay

31
00:01:55,770 --> 00:01:58,229
okay

32
00:01:58,229 --> 00:02:01,399
so that's pretty much what I'm gonna do

33
00:02:01,399 --> 00:02:04,320
this is not an awareness call talk you

34
00:02:04,320 --> 00:02:07,649
know there are many many there have been

35
00:02:07,649 --> 00:02:12,420
a lot of sessions about privacy

36
00:02:12,420 --> 00:02:14,610
awareness like what should you do with

37
00:02:14,610 --> 00:02:17,580
privacy but there's very little at least

38
00:02:17,580 --> 00:02:21,300
to me very little content about what can

39
00:02:21,300 --> 00:02:23,550
you do now okay so I'm gonna try to

40
00:02:23,550 --> 00:02:25,680
introduce at least what I've been

41
00:02:25,680 --> 00:02:27,599
researching in pass in the past couple

42
00:02:27,599 --> 00:02:31,819
of years second thing I believe in a

43
00:02:31,819 --> 00:02:34,830
certainly development centric approach

44
00:02:34,830 --> 00:02:38,010
towards privacy right now privacy is

45
00:02:38,010 --> 00:02:42,269
more like kind of top-down you have

46
00:02:42,269 --> 00:02:44,190
compliance people saying this is what

47
00:02:44,190 --> 00:02:47,130
you have to do and it's it's not even

48
00:02:47,130 --> 00:02:50,640
very very let's say specific so I

49
00:02:50,640 --> 00:02:52,700
believe in what I call you know

50
00:02:52,700 --> 00:02:55,230
grassroots approach we're gonna win X

51
00:02:55,230 --> 00:03:00,480
Pro that a little bit more and and then

52
00:03:00,480 --> 00:03:02,609
yeah we're gonna see just see one way

53
00:03:02,609 --> 00:03:06,209
you know privacy it's a huge huge space

54
00:03:06,209 --> 00:03:09,480
so we're gonna you know I'm gonna kind

55
00:03:09,480 --> 00:03:12,209
of share with you guys what you know

56
00:03:12,209 --> 00:03:15,359
what AI can do for you and it's not so

57
00:03:15,359 --> 00:03:19,549
let's call it AI can seem like very

58
00:03:19,549 --> 00:03:21,810
challenging to approach but right now

59
00:03:21,810 --> 00:03:24,750
there technologies kind of picked up and

60
00:03:24,750 --> 00:03:27,389
it's more let's call it it's easier to

61
00:03:27,389 --> 00:03:30,180
implement solution on top of that so you

62
00:03:30,180 --> 00:03:31,980
can do a lot without having to you know

63
00:03:31,980 --> 00:03:34,739
to build or to buy you know the latest

64
00:03:34,739 --> 00:03:42,930
product so let me keep going so I'm kind

65
00:03:42,930 --> 00:03:47,790
of you know pretty much I I see myself

66
00:03:47,790 --> 00:03:50,190
as a developer I start as a developer

67
00:03:50,190 --> 00:03:53,250
and even if I I ran my my company I

68
00:03:53,250 --> 00:03:56,010
still keep development ok so that's the

69
00:03:56,010 --> 00:03:59,880
way we typically do research and I'm

70
00:03:59,880 --> 00:04:02,849
still very hands-on ok so that my my

71
00:04:02,849 --> 00:04:04,739
heart I'm still a software developer

72
00:04:04,739 --> 00:04:07,470
which is you know love security and

73
00:04:07,470 --> 00:04:10,950
privacy just as a something even to me

74
00:04:10,950 --> 00:04:13,350
that I feel it's very important at least

75
00:04:13,350 --> 00:04:15,090
it's something that is affecting our

76
00:04:15,090 --> 00:04:17,339
personal lives so I if I can contribute

77
00:04:17,339 --> 00:04:21,358
something you know that's that's that's

78
00:04:21,358 --> 00:04:25,890
great so well my first computer was

79
00:04:25,890 --> 00:04:29,790
coming 64 so I'm old I'm not sure if

80
00:04:29,790 --> 00:04:32,520
anyone here a comer 64 you know you had

81
00:04:32,520 --> 00:04:34,920
a prompt and you had to just write basic

82
00:04:34,920 --> 00:04:40,890
that's it so let's let's keep going well

83
00:04:40,890 --> 00:04:43,170
this actually you know I have no

84
00:04:43,170 --> 00:04:45,540
comments on that it's it's a very same

85
00:04:45,540 --> 00:04:51,560
vague very generic but it still applies

86
00:04:51,680 --> 00:04:54,330
for instance where I live in in San

87
00:04:54,330 --> 00:04:58,260
Francisco I I've just once looked up my

88
00:04:58,260 --> 00:05:01,440
name in Google and I found that there

89
00:05:01,440 --> 00:05:04,140
was information about my my house so my

90
00:05:04,140 --> 00:05:06,360
house it was linked with with my

91
00:05:06,360 --> 00:05:09,330
identity so I know I never share that

92
00:05:09,330 --> 00:05:12,720
information okay so I feel you know very

93
00:05:12,720 --> 00:05:14,550
annoyed when these things happen you

94
00:05:14,550 --> 00:05:17,100
find really personal information online

95
00:05:17,100 --> 00:05:22,979
okay so it's not a just easy to fix that

96
00:05:22,979 --> 00:05:27,620
now we're gonna see why it's not so easy

97
00:05:28,310 --> 00:05:31,310
so

98
00:05:31,580 --> 00:05:33,770
few years ago there's this professor

99
00:05:33,770 --> 00:05:35,900
Carol can introduce a concept called

100
00:05:35,900 --> 00:05:39,620
privacy by design so let me I mean start

101
00:05:39,620 --> 00:05:44,270
using this okay which is I think those

102
00:05:44,270 --> 00:05:46,400
principles apply to security too right

103
00:05:46,400 --> 00:05:48,379
you want to anticipate yourself to any

104
00:05:48,379 --> 00:05:54,289
privacy issue so that that's that it has

105
00:05:54,289 --> 00:05:57,639
to be prevent preventative not reactive

106
00:05:57,639 --> 00:06:02,030
prices default means that it's actually

107
00:06:02,030 --> 00:06:05,720
more the the consumer side you know it's

108
00:06:05,720 --> 00:06:09,620
basically you know by default enabling

109
00:06:09,620 --> 00:06:12,650
disabling I mean all the features that

110
00:06:12,650 --> 00:06:14,690
can compromise the consumer privacy you

111
00:06:14,690 --> 00:06:16,610
know for instance if you download an app

112
00:06:16,610 --> 00:06:18,680
typically all the privacy settings are

113
00:06:18,680 --> 00:06:21,530
against you and you have to go to the

114
00:06:21,530 --> 00:06:22,969
settings and say no I don't want to

115
00:06:22,969 --> 00:06:24,800
share this information and so so that's

116
00:06:24,800 --> 00:06:26,870
privacy by default okay so that I think

117
00:06:26,870 --> 00:06:29,319
is really important but my focus today

118
00:06:29,319 --> 00:06:32,770
sorry my focus today is going to be on

119
00:06:32,770 --> 00:06:35,419
the privacy embedded into the design

120
00:06:35,419 --> 00:06:40,270
looks like I lost my see if it works so

121
00:06:40,270 --> 00:06:43,550
and the other concept is that full

122
00:06:43,550 --> 00:06:45,889
functionality that means that if if you

123
00:06:45,889 --> 00:06:48,259
for instance are using a VPN or let's

124
00:06:48,259 --> 00:06:50,870
say an anonymous browser session you

125
00:06:50,870 --> 00:06:53,300
don't want to lose any you know you want

126
00:06:53,300 --> 00:06:55,310
to just stick to the same user

127
00:06:55,310 --> 00:06:57,409
experience you know sometimes you know

128
00:06:57,409 --> 00:06:59,240
when web sites or application detect

129
00:06:59,240 --> 00:07:01,370
that you are whatever trying to protect

130
00:07:01,370 --> 00:07:03,919
your identity somehow they you know the

131
00:07:03,919 --> 00:07:05,719
whole user experience changes against

132
00:07:05,719 --> 00:07:08,020
you so that's that's pretty much what

133
00:07:08,020 --> 00:07:10,699
what do we mean by full functionality

134
00:07:10,699 --> 00:07:14,270
and true and it means that yeah you have

135
00:07:14,270 --> 00:07:18,340
privacy has to be bundled into the whole

136
00:07:18,340 --> 00:07:21,050
sdlc the whole software of the lifecycle

137
00:07:21,050 --> 00:07:24,800
and not only your your your your own but

138
00:07:24,800 --> 00:07:26,719
also beyond the perimeter that's that's

139
00:07:26,719 --> 00:07:29,120
very challenging right and I think be

140
00:07:29,120 --> 00:07:30,979
stability in transparency it's pretty

141
00:07:30,979 --> 00:07:34,580
much respectful user privacy it's it's

142
00:07:34,580 --> 00:07:37,610
the same thing to me okay so if you if

143
00:07:37,610 --> 00:07:39,560
you consider privacy as first-class

144
00:07:39,560 --> 00:07:42,130
citizen you going you're going to

145
00:07:42,130 --> 00:07:43,950
you know you're gonna get all these

146
00:07:43,950 --> 00:07:46,900
attributes quality attributes so let's

147
00:07:46,900 --> 00:07:50,740
see if atleast this works so this is

148
00:07:50,740 --> 00:07:53,710
data at least I have fun 2017 so this is

149
00:07:53,710 --> 00:07:56,950
all I think has been even worse okay so

150
00:07:56,950 --> 00:07:59,500
but this is just an idea of what is the

151
00:07:59,500 --> 00:08:01,420
financial impact then probably see I

152
00:08:01,420 --> 00:08:03,730
don't want to get too much into this

153
00:08:03,730 --> 00:08:07,060
because a lot of has you know there's a

154
00:08:07,060 --> 00:08:09,430
lot of information about this and there

155
00:08:09,430 --> 00:08:14,070
have been few a few significant breaches

156
00:08:14,070 --> 00:08:17,260
you know the past couple of years

157
00:08:17,260 --> 00:08:19,240
you know like Equifax and have been a

158
00:08:19,240 --> 00:08:23,440
couple more so we can uh you know but

159
00:08:23,440 --> 00:08:25,150
this is an idea they financially but I

160
00:08:25,150 --> 00:08:26,770
think it's even more significant it's

161
00:08:26,770 --> 00:08:28,780
very difficult to measure what is the

162
00:08:28,780 --> 00:08:30,490
business impact when when you get your

163
00:08:30,490 --> 00:08:32,530
personal records leak or some sort of

164
00:08:32,530 --> 00:08:40,210
leak in terms of personal data so and

165
00:08:40,210 --> 00:08:42,400
and this we go back to the same constant

166
00:08:42,400 --> 00:08:44,920
to the original concept I was trying to

167
00:08:44,920 --> 00:08:48,430
explain before why is it difficult

168
00:08:48,430 --> 00:08:51,460
because it's it's totally bigfooters

169
00:08:51,460 --> 00:08:53,650
it's not all infrastructure you have to

170
00:08:53,650 --> 00:08:59,560
do it end-to-end as I said before it's

171
00:08:59,560 --> 00:09:02,320
you have to you have to actually it's

172
00:09:02,320 --> 00:09:03,610
not only what happens within the

173
00:09:03,610 --> 00:09:05,140
perimeter but also outside with your

174
00:09:05,140 --> 00:09:07,120
service providers you don't really know

175
00:09:07,120 --> 00:09:09,700
what happens when you send personal

176
00:09:09,700 --> 00:09:12,130
information of your users to I don't

177
00:09:12,130 --> 00:09:13,120
know a service provider like Google

178
00:09:13,120 --> 00:09:15,700
Amazon whatever how do you make sure

179
00:09:15,700 --> 00:09:17,800
that they're they're protecting this

180
00:09:17,800 --> 00:09:20,410
data okay so that's that's very very

181
00:09:20,410 --> 00:09:22,060
challenge and even if you do a really

182
00:09:22,060 --> 00:09:24,940
good job in a protected data you you

183
00:09:24,940 --> 00:09:26,500
know you will never be sure about that

184
00:09:26,500 --> 00:09:29,680
of course there are legal things you can

185
00:09:29,680 --> 00:09:31,570
do you know for that but it's just a

186
00:09:31,570 --> 00:09:34,060
legal framework okay it's not a

187
00:09:34,060 --> 00:09:38,710
technical you know countermeasure and

188
00:09:38,710 --> 00:09:40,440
the other thing is that I think that

189
00:09:40,440 --> 00:09:43,780
privacy itself at all pretty much all

190
00:09:43,780 --> 00:09:45,910
the the Condit I see is very high level

191
00:09:45,910 --> 00:09:48,850
it's difficult to put that into

192
00:09:48,850 --> 00:09:51,370
you know something that works you know

193
00:09:51,370 --> 00:09:53,650
it's just say this is what we should do

194
00:09:53,650 --> 00:09:56,650
and you get some many vendors providing

195
00:09:56,650 --> 00:09:59,170
some very neat solutions but what can I

196
00:09:59,170 --> 00:10:01,930
do now and right and and that's that's

197
00:10:01,930 --> 00:10:04,060
what I feel it's it's just crafted by

198
00:10:04,060 --> 00:10:06,250
design how many people know the term

199
00:10:06,250 --> 00:10:11,380
privacy by design or pbd here cool okay

200
00:10:11,380 --> 00:10:12,970
oh we got a few people okay that's

201
00:10:12,970 --> 00:10:19,390
that's great so the other thing is uh I

202
00:10:19,390 --> 00:10:21,280
mean the other thing is lack of okay

203
00:10:21,280 --> 00:10:23,320
there are no tools very little tools and

204
00:10:23,320 --> 00:10:25,420
if you want to I mean there are some

205
00:10:25,420 --> 00:10:28,060
tools but are coming from startups or

206
00:10:28,060 --> 00:10:30,220
large corporations summer bases Silicon

207
00:10:30,220 --> 00:10:32,830
Valley but I believe that that's you

208
00:10:32,830 --> 00:10:34,960
know the mindset that the tool will be

209
00:10:34,960 --> 00:10:38,140
the solution is very dangerous okay I

210
00:10:38,140 --> 00:10:39,970
think security there is no perfect tool

211
00:10:39,970 --> 00:10:41,470
you actually it's a combination of tools

212
00:10:41,470 --> 00:10:44,380
plus your know-how and plus the you know

213
00:10:44,380 --> 00:10:47,290
kind of your expertise about what you

214
00:10:47,290 --> 00:10:48,940
have to protect in terms of how your

215
00:10:48,940 --> 00:10:51,370
business works so I honestly believe

216
00:10:51,370 --> 00:10:54,490
even if I you know I work and try to

217
00:10:54,490 --> 00:10:57,390
create technologies with my company with

218
00:10:57,390 --> 00:10:59,050
terms of privacy

219
00:10:59,050 --> 00:11:01,870
I don't believe tool is the tooling is

220
00:11:01,870 --> 00:11:04,300
is the problem okay it's just part of

221
00:11:04,300 --> 00:11:07,750
the solution just part and I think this

222
00:11:07,750 --> 00:11:10,120
this is also applies to security and

223
00:11:10,120 --> 00:11:12,510
typically management is it's you know

224
00:11:12,510 --> 00:11:15,790
application of security it's some

225
00:11:15,790 --> 00:11:19,120
somehow it's more known because it's

226
00:11:19,120 --> 00:11:21,880
older but privacy application security

227
00:11:21,880 --> 00:11:24,130
is a very new subject a new topic so

228
00:11:24,130 --> 00:11:27,070
there's not a lot of information and so

229
00:11:27,070 --> 00:11:28,870
it's difficult to get funding cific

230
00:11:28,870 --> 00:11:30,880
difficult to you know kind of there's an

231
00:11:30,880 --> 00:11:32,470
effort in to evangelize and do the

232
00:11:32,470 --> 00:11:37,870
management so I'm going to do something

233
00:11:37,870 --> 00:11:40,840
a little bit controversial here so what

234
00:11:40,840 --> 00:11:42,700
do I mean by grassroot adoption I mean

235
00:11:42,700 --> 00:11:45,400
that as security guys okay there are a

236
00:11:45,400 --> 00:11:47,020
lot of I've heard that a lot of cyber

237
00:11:47,020 --> 00:11:51,790
security people here you want to you

238
00:11:51,790 --> 00:11:54,640
know you can actually start bundling

239
00:11:54,640 --> 00:11:56,800
privacy capabilities into your

240
00:11:56,800 --> 00:11:59,800
infrastructure right now that and I

241
00:11:59,800 --> 00:12:01,570
believe that you don't have to wait for

242
00:12:01,570 --> 00:12:02,290
you

243
00:12:02,290 --> 00:12:04,749
permit me to tell you this is what we

244
00:12:04,749 --> 00:12:06,699
should do and you know that's gonna be

245
00:12:06,699 --> 00:12:11,109
probably too late okay you so my my what

246
00:12:11,109 --> 00:12:13,869
I'm proposing here it's more like what

247
00:12:13,869 --> 00:12:15,459
is called a you know the cathedral and

248
00:12:15,459 --> 00:12:18,970
the bazaar that's a typical book paper

249
00:12:18,970 --> 00:12:22,059
that pretty much explains how the linear

250
00:12:22,059 --> 00:12:25,350
soft development process worked and

251
00:12:25,350 --> 00:12:27,789
agreement is actually when you know

252
00:12:27,789 --> 00:12:30,309
contributed to the one of the core

253
00:12:30,309 --> 00:12:32,350
pieces of another kernel but the

254
00:12:32,350 --> 00:12:33,939
sentiment but he he pretty much

255
00:12:33,939 --> 00:12:35,139
explained how that works

256
00:12:35,139 --> 00:12:37,779
I believe that bringing that all that

257
00:12:37,779 --> 00:12:43,149
risque model to to privacy at least in

258
00:12:43,149 --> 00:12:46,539
protecting you know personal data from

259
00:12:46,539 --> 00:12:49,089
in the application I think it's a it's a

260
00:12:49,089 --> 00:12:55,929
it's a very healthy approach and as you

261
00:12:55,929 --> 00:12:58,809
can see here it's a you know you can you

262
00:12:58,809 --> 00:13:01,029
can pretty much use techniques that are

263
00:13:01,029 --> 00:13:04,869
available in existing software security

264
00:13:04,869 --> 00:13:06,819
testing okay so static code analysis

265
00:13:06,819 --> 00:13:09,609
that I'm a code analysis it's it's not

266
00:13:09,609 --> 00:13:11,889
very different so what I believe in is

267
00:13:11,889 --> 00:13:13,720
that you can you can start introducing

268
00:13:13,720 --> 00:13:16,149
those capabilities incrementally because

269
00:13:16,149 --> 00:13:18,459
to me I mean privacy security so if

270
00:13:18,459 --> 00:13:19,989
you're responsible security you know you

271
00:13:19,989 --> 00:13:22,419
can you can also and you should I think

272
00:13:22,419 --> 00:13:24,189
that what I believe

273
00:13:24,189 --> 00:13:26,079
start you know caring about about

274
00:13:26,079 --> 00:13:28,569
privacy to how the application is pretty

275
00:13:28,569 --> 00:13:30,459
much handling personal data flowing

276
00:13:30,459 --> 00:13:33,429
through it that's that when I say that's

277
00:13:33,429 --> 00:13:36,720
privacy by design pretty much

278
00:13:38,530 --> 00:13:41,320
so here this is a kind of head-to-head

279
00:13:41,320 --> 00:13:44,370
comparison okay

280
00:13:44,370 --> 00:13:48,670
right now pretty much the process that

281
00:13:48,670 --> 00:13:51,520
is described people you know promote

282
00:13:51,520 --> 00:13:54,280
these is the first one policies what I

283
00:13:54,280 --> 00:13:57,700
kind of call policy driven so there's

284
00:13:57,700 --> 00:13:59,950
just a change to security policy or a

285
00:13:59,950 --> 00:14:02,500
security architecture or something you

286
00:14:02,500 --> 00:14:05,470
know that kind of goes top-down to

287
00:14:05,470 --> 00:14:07,690
developers or security architects and

288
00:14:07,690 --> 00:14:10,480
that process can take a lot of time okay

289
00:14:10,480 --> 00:14:13,900
and I'm not saying to discard that but

290
00:14:13,900 --> 00:14:15,520
what I'm saying is that kind of to start

291
00:14:15,520 --> 00:14:17,260
doing something right away as part of

292
00:14:17,260 --> 00:14:20,050
the security efforts okay so that's why

293
00:14:20,050 --> 00:14:21,910
the main difference engineering dreaming

294
00:14:21,910 --> 00:14:25,000
you know versus policy driven these are

295
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:27,400
all concepts coming from from the you

296
00:14:27,400 --> 00:14:30,010
know these cathedral and the bazaar you

297
00:14:30,010 --> 00:14:34,840
know kind of approach the other thing as

298
00:14:34,840 --> 00:14:36,880
much before you can build on top of your

299
00:14:36,880 --> 00:14:39,640
existing capabilities so the techniques

300
00:14:39,640 --> 00:14:43,870
used for doing PII detection so techie

301
00:14:43,870 --> 00:14:45,190
personal day they are not very very

302
00:14:45,190 --> 00:14:48,280
different so it will take some time you

303
00:14:48,280 --> 00:14:49,990
know to kind of walk these the learning

304
00:14:49,990 --> 00:14:52,480
curve but at least I mean it's the

305
00:14:52,480 --> 00:14:54,160
techniques are not very very very

306
00:14:54,160 --> 00:14:58,030
different and the other difference is

307
00:14:58,030 --> 00:15:01,630
you know typically all pretty much all

308
00:15:01,630 --> 00:15:04,360
most vendors they approach the problem

309
00:15:04,360 --> 00:15:06,190
from the data perspective that means

310
00:15:06,190 --> 00:15:07,600
that you know they scan your

311
00:15:07,600 --> 00:15:10,240
repositories and look for PII you know

312
00:15:10,240 --> 00:15:12,060
personal data and they kind of flag that

313
00:15:12,060 --> 00:15:15,910
I think that's that's very limited

314
00:15:15,910 --> 00:15:18,040
because you know before you have the

315
00:15:18,040 --> 00:15:20,380
actual data goes to the database of some

316
00:15:20,380 --> 00:15:23,140
repository a lot happened and typically

317
00:15:23,140 --> 00:15:25,720
the application is in front of that okay

318
00:15:25,720 --> 00:15:29,110
so if for some reason personal data is

319
00:15:29,110 --> 00:15:31,750
being leaked for some whatever bug or on

320
00:15:31,750 --> 00:15:33,760
purpose who knows you know you're not

321
00:15:33,760 --> 00:15:36,010
gonna know so I believe you do have to

322
00:15:36,010 --> 00:15:37,540
protect you know your infrastructure

323
00:15:37,540 --> 00:15:39,610
your databases whatever but you also

324
00:15:39,610 --> 00:15:41,650
have to protect your software as much as

325
00:15:41,650 --> 00:15:43,870
possible and make sure that the software

326
00:15:43,870 --> 00:15:45,430
using the cloud which is something very

327
00:15:45,430 --> 00:15:45,880
different

328
00:15:45,880 --> 00:15:47,470
it's also

329
00:15:47,470 --> 00:15:49,930
some privacy quality standards so it's

330
00:15:49,930 --> 00:15:51,430
it's very difficult to know that

331
00:15:51,430 --> 00:15:55,300
actually the other thing I'm suggesting

332
00:15:55,300 --> 00:15:57,220
which kind of goes against my interest a

333
00:15:57,220 --> 00:16:00,370
little bit is try to build your own

334
00:16:00,370 --> 00:16:02,920
stuff you can make third-party tools but

335
00:16:02,920 --> 00:16:05,350
try to build your own stack because

336
00:16:05,350 --> 00:16:07,090
every company is different there is no

337
00:16:07,090 --> 00:16:09,910
silver bullet okay this same thing I

338
00:16:09,910 --> 00:16:12,250
think applies to security at least the

339
00:16:12,250 --> 00:16:14,110
companies I know I work with they all

340
00:16:14,110 --> 00:16:18,100
have their their own stack you know to

341
00:16:18,100 --> 00:16:20,140
deal with security I think same thing

342
00:16:20,140 --> 00:16:25,240
should happen with with privacy so this

343
00:16:25,240 --> 00:16:28,030
is a kind of instead just we were I was

344
00:16:28,030 --> 00:16:31,330
kind of I was a like ten ten thousand

345
00:16:31,330 --> 00:16:33,070
feet okay so let's let's go a little bit

346
00:16:33,070 --> 00:16:33,640
deeper

347
00:16:33,640 --> 00:16:36,820
okay so let's you know this is one of

348
00:16:36,820 --> 00:16:38,860
the concepts we've explored I've worked

349
00:16:38,860 --> 00:16:40,570
directly with that but it's just one of

350
00:16:40,570 --> 00:16:43,080
the experiments okay that we eventually

351
00:16:43,080 --> 00:16:46,240
experienced from all these prototypes

352
00:16:46,240 --> 00:16:47,890
eventually gets into the product or

353
00:16:47,890 --> 00:16:49,990
whatever but this is something we've

354
00:16:49,990 --> 00:16:52,300
open sourced and something out there you

355
00:16:52,300 --> 00:16:54,010
can play with kick tires to whatever we

356
00:16:54,010 --> 00:16:57,190
want it's just something as an example

357
00:16:57,190 --> 00:16:58,960
that there are things you can do with

358
00:16:58,960 --> 00:17:05,710
not so much effort so the main things

359
00:17:05,710 --> 00:17:07,540
you know with privateer what is privy I

360
00:17:07,540 --> 00:17:12,160
try VIH is basically geared towards

361
00:17:12,160 --> 00:17:14,730
trying to detect personal data flowing

362
00:17:14,730 --> 00:17:19,450
throughout your API endpoints okay so

363
00:17:19,450 --> 00:17:21,940
any personal data flowing from from

364
00:17:21,940 --> 00:17:25,210
let's say a web service yeah okay should

365
00:17:25,210 --> 00:17:28,480
be and can be detected okay and at least

366
00:17:28,480 --> 00:17:31,120
you should you should know and this what

367
00:17:31,120 --> 00:17:32,920
I believe in is kind of to apply this

368
00:17:32,920 --> 00:17:35,680
strategy while the application are being

369
00:17:35,680 --> 00:17:37,780
developed now not only applications in

370
00:17:37,780 --> 00:17:39,250
production so as your developer

371
00:17:39,250 --> 00:17:40,930
application you can start checking

372
00:17:40,930 --> 00:17:43,000
whether there are applications that are

373
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:45,850
just transmitting personal data into

374
00:17:45,850 --> 00:17:48,790
your text okay for instance so as soon

375
00:17:48,790 --> 00:17:50,290
as you start with the with your

376
00:17:50,290 --> 00:17:52,060
development cycle you can introduce this

377
00:17:52,060 --> 00:17:57,700
kind of practices so the the other so

378
00:17:57,700 --> 00:17:59,170
these are kind of the challenges there

379
00:17:59,170 --> 00:18:00,470
was no data set when you have

380
00:18:00,470 --> 00:18:02,030
machine learning model you need the data

381
00:18:02,030 --> 00:18:05,240
data is kind of the key thing at least

382
00:18:05,240 --> 00:18:08,450
this is what I has been my experience so

383
00:18:08,450 --> 00:18:11,060
if you don't how can you teach the

384
00:18:11,060 --> 00:18:13,730
machine to pretty much know what is

385
00:18:13,730 --> 00:18:15,830
personal data and what it's not right so

386
00:18:15,830 --> 00:18:18,080
this was one of the one of the issues of

387
00:18:18,080 --> 00:18:21,560
course there are no standards I didn't I

388
00:18:21,560 --> 00:18:22,700
didn't want to into an approach where

389
00:18:22,700 --> 00:18:25,070
you have a human being kind of labeling

390
00:18:25,070 --> 00:18:26,750
and say yeah this is probably this it's

391
00:18:26,750 --> 00:18:28,610
not that that's a lot of money that's

392
00:18:28,610 --> 00:18:33,230
too expensive and of course PII is not

393
00:18:33,230 --> 00:18:34,970
out there online right you cannot find

394
00:18:34,970 --> 00:18:36,920
easily Social Security numbers I mean

395
00:18:36,920 --> 00:18:39,830
you can if you want but I mean it's it's

396
00:18:39,830 --> 00:18:42,320
not it's not legal right so that that's

397
00:18:42,320 --> 00:18:45,800
pretty that's pretty tough so of course

398
00:18:45,800 --> 00:18:48,080
there is they're practically I at least

399
00:18:48,080 --> 00:18:50,780
I'm gonna have a very little very few

400
00:18:50,780 --> 00:18:52,850
projects dealing with PII okay or

401
00:18:52,850 --> 00:18:54,620
something that's related with privacy

402
00:18:54,620 --> 00:18:57,740
you know kind of that works so it's kind

403
00:18:57,740 --> 00:18:59,540
of you're pretty much alone okay there's

404
00:18:59,540 --> 00:19:02,960
not much on that from just many several

405
00:19:02,960 --> 00:19:05,210
commercial products but you know you

406
00:19:05,210 --> 00:19:06,560
don't have the source code to to learn

407
00:19:06,560 --> 00:19:09,350
from that okay so this is high level

408
00:19:09,350 --> 00:19:11,480
architecture but we're gonna kind of

409
00:19:11,480 --> 00:19:12,170
split it

410
00:19:12,170 --> 00:19:15,230
okay I'm gonna I'm gonna it's going to

411
00:19:15,230 --> 00:19:19,420
be clear as we kind of split it here so

412
00:19:19,420 --> 00:19:22,220
so let me let me check the time and I

413
00:19:22,220 --> 00:19:29,510
want to run okay so pretty much so since

414
00:19:29,510 --> 00:19:31,130
we don't have the data there is a

415
00:19:31,130 --> 00:19:32,480
technique in machine learning it's

416
00:19:32,480 --> 00:19:35,240
called a which is basically generating

417
00:19:35,240 --> 00:19:36,950
your own data set okay

418
00:19:36,950 --> 00:19:40,220
the problem with that is that the data

419
00:19:40,220 --> 00:19:42,640
set will be probably biased will be

420
00:19:42,640 --> 00:19:46,190
artificial and will not match real-world

421
00:19:46,190 --> 00:19:50,780
data okay so that's it's a very you have

422
00:19:50,780 --> 00:19:52,460
to be very careful with that because if

423
00:19:52,460 --> 00:19:54,230
not you know it's not gonna work you

424
00:19:54,230 --> 00:19:56,780
know maybe it works in with your test

425
00:19:56,780 --> 00:19:58,130
data but then when you run it with

426
00:19:58,130 --> 00:20:00,590
real-world data it's just not going to

427
00:20:00,590 --> 00:20:03,680
classify correctly you know any any any

428
00:20:03,680 --> 00:20:07,560
restful api message so

429
00:20:07,560 --> 00:20:10,050
so this works very much in the in the

430
00:20:10,050 --> 00:20:13,290
following way so what we what we

431
00:20:13,290 --> 00:20:17,130
essentially did is you know you know we

432
00:20:17,130 --> 00:20:20,400
we wanted to generate the example API

433
00:20:20,400 --> 00:20:22,650
request restful api requests so pretty

434
00:20:22,650 --> 00:20:27,300
much Jason payloads okay so the way to

435
00:20:27,300 --> 00:20:31,020
do that dream easily was to kind of tap

436
00:20:31,020 --> 00:20:36,360
into existing restful api infrastructure

437
00:20:36,360 --> 00:20:38,190
so instead of sending the message

438
00:20:38,190 --> 00:20:40,290
through out the wire we can just save it

439
00:20:40,290 --> 00:20:43,190
right we can tap into the into the

440
00:20:43,190 --> 00:20:45,510
request generation process and we can

441
00:20:45,510 --> 00:20:47,640
just say okay we're not gonna send it

442
00:20:47,640 --> 00:20:49,050
for otherwise we're just gonna save it

443
00:20:49,050 --> 00:20:53,430
okay so that's that's pretty much the

444
00:20:53,430 --> 00:20:55,470
approach now with the data it's not

445
00:20:55,470 --> 00:20:58,020
graph you have to tell you have to

446
00:20:58,020 --> 00:21:02,280
actually define what kind of one or

447
00:21:02,280 --> 00:21:04,800
whether that's it has PII or doesn't

448
00:21:04,800 --> 00:21:07,350
have PII oh okay personal data promote

449
00:21:07,350 --> 00:21:11,670
PII is personally identifying data so

450
00:21:11,670 --> 00:21:14,100
that's why you have you know we use a

451
00:21:14,100 --> 00:21:17,040
very basic approach and there's a lot

452
00:21:17,040 --> 00:21:19,070
you can do in terms of improving the

453
00:21:19,070 --> 00:21:22,020
labeling so Lebanese that is saying okay

454
00:21:22,020 --> 00:21:25,050
this is VI this is not and for now it's

455
00:21:25,050 --> 00:21:26,580
just binary but you can have many

456
00:21:26,580 --> 00:21:28,710
different labels like this is PII this

457
00:21:28,710 --> 00:21:30,960
is financial information this is health

458
00:21:30,960 --> 00:21:33,780
care related information and there's a

459
00:21:33,780 --> 00:21:35,610
lot you can do on that front okay we're

460
00:21:35,610 --> 00:21:37,860
gonna explore a few few strategies at

461
00:21:37,860 --> 00:21:43,440
the end so bottom line we have we have

462
00:21:43,440 --> 00:21:45,930
these requests we can we label this

463
00:21:45,930 --> 00:21:47,820
request and then there was the challenge

464
00:21:47,820 --> 00:21:50,580
here I mean let me go I explain the flow

465
00:21:50,580 --> 00:21:55,650
here the problem was that what we used

466
00:21:55,650 --> 00:21:58,350
as an input we're open API descriptors

467
00:21:58,350 --> 00:22:01,860
so how do we know how requests look like

468
00:22:01,860 --> 00:22:06,240
so the good news is that opening FeLV

469
00:22:06,240 --> 00:22:10,260
API descriptors are actually available

470
00:22:10,260 --> 00:22:12,960
online they're pretty good quality so

471
00:22:12,960 --> 00:22:15,180
with that we can actually we can build

472
00:22:15,180 --> 00:22:17,309
pretty real world looking API

473
00:22:17,309 --> 00:22:19,200
messages okay in terms of structure

474
00:22:19,200 --> 00:22:22,740
think about you know how Jason messages

475
00:22:22,740 --> 00:22:24,179
are tipping structure in API

476
00:22:24,179 --> 00:22:28,889
communication okay so that that's what

477
00:22:28,889 --> 00:22:31,379
we use and and this is what pretty much

478
00:22:31,379 --> 00:22:36,179
I've I've explained okay one important

479
00:22:36,179 --> 00:22:38,370
note it's this is just a baseline for

480
00:22:38,370 --> 00:22:41,249
you to get started then you you know

481
00:22:41,249 --> 00:22:43,529
ideally you want to to get some

482
00:22:43,529 --> 00:22:45,779
real-world data you know into the into

483
00:22:45,779 --> 00:22:48,029
the model because it's you know it's

484
00:22:48,029 --> 00:22:50,309
gonna be it's gonna be very

485
00:22:50,309 --> 00:22:52,259
domain-specific you know if you're a

486
00:22:52,259 --> 00:22:56,490
financial institution your API payloads

487
00:22:56,490 --> 00:22:58,619
will look pretty different from you know

488
00:22:58,619 --> 00:23:00,809
healthcare you know service provider

489
00:23:00,809 --> 00:23:03,690
okay so it's for now open API

490
00:23:03,690 --> 00:23:05,850
descriptors is pretty much you know you

491
00:23:05,850 --> 00:23:08,159
have a lot of descriptor from online

492
00:23:08,159 --> 00:23:11,700
banks from Google Amazon Microsoft

493
00:23:11,700 --> 00:23:15,389
whatever so it's it's kind of generic

494
00:23:15,389 --> 00:23:18,179
but if you if you wanna you probably

495
00:23:18,179 --> 00:23:21,450
have here you know your own formats that

496
00:23:21,450 --> 00:23:27,269
you wanna you want to build on so the

497
00:23:27,269 --> 00:23:31,980
training is pretty much easy so once

498
00:23:31,980 --> 00:23:34,379
again there's something very interesting

499
00:23:34,379 --> 00:23:36,929
you want to look which is called Tara's

500
00:23:36,929 --> 00:23:38,789
it's a Google framework which pretty

501
00:23:38,789 --> 00:23:40,830
much abstracts you from the complexity

502
00:23:40,830 --> 00:23:43,320
of deep neural networks I mean you still

503
00:23:43,320 --> 00:23:46,320
have to know what you're doing but this

504
00:23:46,320 --> 00:23:49,499
the whole heavy lifting of creating a

505
00:23:49,499 --> 00:23:51,659
deep neural network is pretty much you

506
00:23:51,659 --> 00:23:54,299
know kind of solved by by carrots okay

507
00:23:54,299 --> 00:23:56,879
so instead of implementing whatever your

508
00:23:56,879 --> 00:23:59,249
your code will be instead of being 300

509
00:23:59,249 --> 00:24:01,619
lines it's gonna be probably 10 or 15

510
00:24:01,619 --> 00:24:03,960
lines okay so it's a it's more concise

511
00:24:03,960 --> 00:24:05,940
mortars but at the same time you still

512
00:24:05,940 --> 00:24:08,730
want to know what what you're doing but

513
00:24:08,730 --> 00:24:12,450
it's it's much easier so that's why I'm

514
00:24:12,450 --> 00:24:14,940
and kind of you know using Harris it's

515
00:24:14,940 --> 00:24:18,779
also obstructs me from the specific deep

516
00:24:18,779 --> 00:24:20,759
neural network framework so I can I can

517
00:24:20,759 --> 00:24:23,879
I can use Microsoft I can use I can use

518
00:24:23,879 --> 00:24:25,619
tensor flow like in this case so you can

519
00:24:25,619 --> 00:24:27,090
you know whatever it's supported by

520
00:24:27,090 --> 00:24:28,500
carriers you can you can use it's not

521
00:24:28,500 --> 00:24:29,380
really like

522
00:24:29,380 --> 00:24:30,790
but there are some features with

523
00:24:30,790 --> 00:24:34,870
downward as expected so this is an LST M

524
00:24:34,870 --> 00:24:36,940
there's a whole discussion about why you

525
00:24:36,940 --> 00:24:40,540
know I'm using Alice TM but it's it's a

526
00:24:40,540 --> 00:24:42,580
type of you know within neural networks

527
00:24:42,580 --> 00:24:44,130
you have many many different topologies

528
00:24:44,130 --> 00:24:46,720
lsdm happens to be really good at

529
00:24:46,720 --> 00:24:51,430
processing at a kind of natural language

530
00:24:51,430 --> 00:24:55,030
processing tasks okay so it's a it's

531
00:24:55,030 --> 00:24:58,720
pretty much the main I think feature is

532
00:24:58,720 --> 00:25:03,010
that it's able to remember kind of facts

533
00:25:03,010 --> 00:25:04,930
that happen before so when you're

534
00:25:04,930 --> 00:25:07,090
processing a Jason message it's a

535
00:25:07,090 --> 00:25:09,460
sequence right you want to know when you

536
00:25:09,460 --> 00:25:11,500
find the social to your number what you

537
00:25:11,500 --> 00:25:12,970
know what happened before you know

538
00:25:12,970 --> 00:25:15,460
because you have other Jason objects

539
00:25:15,460 --> 00:25:17,650
before that right and that that is is

540
00:25:17,650 --> 00:25:19,870
relevant okay because it pretty much

541
00:25:19,870 --> 00:25:21,640
tells you whether that's you know a

542
00:25:21,640 --> 00:25:24,940
typical Jason paler or not okay so

543
00:25:24,940 --> 00:25:27,790
that's that's what we're using with with

544
00:25:27,790 --> 00:25:29,970
this

545
00:25:31,750 --> 00:25:34,210
so the training works as much before

546
00:25:34,210 --> 00:25:37,539
it's here it's a little bit more detail

547
00:25:37,539 --> 00:25:40,650
but it's vector headings is pretty much

548
00:25:40,650 --> 00:25:44,400
let's call it the it's like the native

549
00:25:44,400 --> 00:25:47,880
language of any machine learning

550
00:25:47,880 --> 00:25:51,130
framework that that's the that's kind of

551
00:25:51,130 --> 00:25:53,020
the the main representation the core

552
00:25:53,020 --> 00:25:55,090
representation because you will you

553
00:25:55,090 --> 00:25:57,700
cannot just paste our inject text just

554
00:25:57,700 --> 00:25:58,929
like that you have to create something

555
00:25:58,929 --> 00:26:01,870
that pretty much is all you know numbers

556
00:26:01,870 --> 00:26:05,169
digits okay so the model doesn't really

557
00:26:05,169 --> 00:26:06,490
know that it's dealing with text so you

558
00:26:06,490 --> 00:26:09,220
have to pretty much map the text to

559
00:26:09,220 --> 00:26:11,860
something that is that can be processed

560
00:26:11,860 --> 00:26:14,380
by a deep neural network okay and

561
00:26:14,380 --> 00:26:15,580
there's of course the mineral networks

562
00:26:15,580 --> 00:26:17,020
you know you can invest if you want ten

563
00:26:17,020 --> 00:26:18,520
years you know investigating that

564
00:26:18,520 --> 00:26:20,980
there's so much but I do believe that

565
00:26:20,980 --> 00:26:24,130
with with not significant knowledge you

566
00:26:24,130 --> 00:26:26,200
can you can start experimenting and kind

567
00:26:26,200 --> 00:26:29,049
of empirically you know and and and then

568
00:26:29,049 --> 00:26:30,400
eventually you know whatever is missing

569
00:26:30,400 --> 00:26:33,370
you know you can you can focus on that

570
00:26:33,370 --> 00:26:36,070
or get training on that whatever or you

571
00:26:36,070 --> 00:26:37,809
can just learn him by by yourself okay

572
00:26:37,809 --> 00:26:40,150
so it's I think we are leaving a very

573
00:26:40,150 --> 00:26:41,770
interesting times in terms of that it's

574
00:26:41,770 --> 00:26:43,330
it's new technologies more approachable

575
00:26:43,330 --> 00:26:45,580
and I believe security people are

576
00:26:45,580 --> 00:26:47,950
typically the curious type of people and

577
00:26:47,950 --> 00:26:49,720
I think if you're couriers and you're

578
00:26:49,720 --> 00:26:50,950
willing to spend some time you know you

579
00:26:50,950 --> 00:26:53,260
can perfectly if you look at the code

580
00:26:53,260 --> 00:26:55,000
you'll see that the training piece is

581
00:26:55,000 --> 00:26:56,980
like it's like pretty much the core is

582
00:26:56,980 --> 00:26:59,860
like ten lines 15 lines of code okay of

583
00:26:59,860 --> 00:27:02,799
course it's very basic it's it's it can

584
00:27:02,799 --> 00:27:04,960
be improved significantly but still you

585
00:27:04,960 --> 00:27:09,640
know it's a way to get started so so

586
00:27:09,640 --> 00:27:11,830
once you have the model right you need

587
00:27:11,830 --> 00:27:14,140
to do predictions with pretty much ease

588
00:27:14,140 --> 00:27:17,830
you know you get a JSON payload and you

589
00:27:17,830 --> 00:27:19,720
want to you want to make sure you want

590
00:27:19,720 --> 00:27:21,850
to know whether that contains or not PII

591
00:27:21,850 --> 00:27:25,000
of course not gonna be a one boolean

592
00:27:25,000 --> 00:27:26,919
response it's not binary it's gonna give

593
00:27:26,919 --> 00:27:30,039
you a kind of probability say well

594
00:27:30,039 --> 00:27:34,000
there's a 70% chance that this is PII so

595
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:35,919
it will depend a lot what kind of data

596
00:27:35,919 --> 00:27:39,580
you feed you know into the model so it's

597
00:27:39,580 --> 00:27:41,860
very sensitive to that and the other

598
00:27:41,860 --> 00:27:42,800
channel

599
00:27:42,800 --> 00:27:46,340
is that you need a lot of data okay it's

600
00:27:46,340 --> 00:27:50,450
not just a few few requests and curious

601
00:27:50,450 --> 00:27:53,210
I think I was able to generate about a

602
00:27:53,210 --> 00:27:57,110
30k you know data points so it's just

603
00:27:57,110 --> 00:27:59,300
enough I you can you can generate much

604
00:27:59,300 --> 00:28:00,740
more you know there are different

605
00:28:00,740 --> 00:28:02,540
techniques to generate you know more

606
00:28:02,540 --> 00:28:05,780
more entries eventually you can use add

607
00:28:05,780 --> 00:28:08,420
other API so whatever so the prediction

608
00:28:08,420 --> 00:28:12,380
works in this way you get the let's

609
00:28:12,380 --> 00:28:15,020
assume you're in live system you get the

610
00:28:15,020 --> 00:28:17,780
JSON request message you then you have

611
00:28:17,780 --> 00:28:20,240
to vectorize this so transform it to

612
00:28:20,240 --> 00:28:22,760
this representation that is AI friendly

613
00:28:22,760 --> 00:28:24,560
let's call like that and then you say

614
00:28:24,560 --> 00:28:27,440
well now tell me if this contains a PRI

615
00:28:27,440 --> 00:28:29,330
or not and then you get you get this

616
00:28:29,330 --> 00:28:32,480
probability okay so it's you know SPI I

617
00:28:32,480 --> 00:28:38,300
here so this is pretty much why I

618
00:28:38,300 --> 00:28:40,700
explain you know I I'm trying to I also

619
00:28:40,700 --> 00:28:42,950
describe that so for the record so that

620
00:28:42,950 --> 00:28:44,780
you know this presentation will be

621
00:28:44,780 --> 00:28:47,360
available for download so you can still

622
00:28:47,360 --> 00:28:50,140
still there okay

623
00:28:50,140 --> 00:28:55,070
things to consider I said before and I

624
00:28:55,070 --> 00:28:57,050
you know this is just a baseline

625
00:28:57,050 --> 00:28:59,360
something you can use to start with it's

626
00:28:59,360 --> 00:29:02,510
not you know depending on the data and

627
00:29:02,510 --> 00:29:04,550
how you generate and how is how the

628
00:29:04,550 --> 00:29:06,050
tools configure you you're gonna get

629
00:29:06,050 --> 00:29:06,700
better

630
00:29:06,700 --> 00:29:12,230
output or worse output okay so and one

631
00:29:12,230 --> 00:29:14,300
of the key things here and I believe is

632
00:29:14,300 --> 00:29:16,940
how you generate these synthetic data

633
00:29:16,940 --> 00:29:18,950
this kind of fake data and the other

634
00:29:18,950 --> 00:29:21,020
thing is labeling how do you know

635
00:29:21,020 --> 00:29:23,270
whether that request is really PII or

636
00:29:23,270 --> 00:29:25,790
not for now we you know we're using a

637
00:29:25,790 --> 00:29:27,560
pretty basic techniques with trigger

638
00:29:27,560 --> 00:29:28,820
words I'll say you know when we find

639
00:29:28,820 --> 00:29:31,310
some some hint in terms of this could be

640
00:29:31,310 --> 00:29:33,440
yeah yeah you know we just label a it'll

641
00:29:33,440 --> 00:29:36,140
say well this is PII okay but there are

642
00:29:36,140 --> 00:29:38,240
many more sophisticated techniques you

643
00:29:38,240 --> 00:29:40,580
can use typically with natural language

644
00:29:40,580 --> 00:29:43,850
processing it's it's a way you know you

645
00:29:43,850 --> 00:29:46,310
can analyze kind of the JSON pail and

646
00:29:46,310 --> 00:29:49,310
say well this this might be this might

647
00:29:49,310 --> 00:29:52,970
be a PII contain PA you can label that

648
00:29:52,970 --> 00:29:53,639
as PA

649
00:29:53,639 --> 00:29:57,179
or not of course the other thing is that

650
00:29:57,179 --> 00:30:00,029
of course you know a completely

651
00:30:00,029 --> 00:30:01,649
automated approach doesn't work you

652
00:30:01,649 --> 00:30:04,440
typically want to make sure that any any

653
00:30:04,440 --> 00:30:07,859
labeling action has been taken or at

654
00:30:07,859 --> 00:30:09,479
least the ones you're not you don't have

655
00:30:09,479 --> 00:30:11,639
a lot of confidence it's actually

656
00:30:11,639 --> 00:30:13,499
validated by a human being okay and say

657
00:30:13,499 --> 00:30:15,329
well this is actually wrong so you can

658
00:30:15,329 --> 00:30:17,549
improve or the person can say this is

659
00:30:17,549 --> 00:30:20,039
okay and this or this is not okay so

660
00:30:20,039 --> 00:30:21,209
you're going to improve the quality of

661
00:30:21,209 --> 00:30:24,599
the model and the other thing once you

662
00:30:24,599 --> 00:30:26,099
get the mobile online you want to make

663
00:30:26,099 --> 00:30:28,200
sure that you know that model is updated

664
00:30:28,200 --> 00:30:30,359
you know kind of a real-time not

665
00:30:30,359 --> 00:30:31,709
real-time bad at least you know

666
00:30:31,709 --> 00:30:35,339
continuously and and that that I think

667
00:30:35,339 --> 00:30:38,339
applies not only for to pry API applies

668
00:30:38,339 --> 00:30:41,459
to any 20 model but the the challenge

669
00:30:41,459 --> 00:30:43,469
here is I think the synthetic data set

670
00:30:43,469 --> 00:30:45,450
if you have a real-world data set I will

671
00:30:45,450 --> 00:30:48,450
go ahead and use that instead or combine

672
00:30:48,450 --> 00:30:53,099
it you know so let's see how much time

673
00:30:53,099 --> 00:30:55,428
do we have

674
00:30:55,789 --> 00:30:59,459
okay any questions so far I mean okay

675
00:30:59,459 --> 00:31:07,679
yeah go ahead sorry I have the defense's

676
00:31:07,679 --> 00:31:10,700
like yeah

677
00:31:17,780 --> 00:31:21,830
I cannot hear it you have a make or I'm

678
00:31:21,830 --> 00:31:24,100
sorry

679
00:31:25,470 --> 00:31:28,590
yeah thank you yeah that's good okay so

680
00:31:28,590 --> 00:31:30,870
yes so far like this is actually helping

681
00:31:30,870 --> 00:31:33,090
go like as far as understood like food

682
00:31:33,090 --> 00:31:35,430
like the linking of the API itself so

683
00:31:35,430 --> 00:31:37,590
like if if the area is leaking some

684
00:31:37,590 --> 00:31:41,430
other information back but maybe there

685
00:31:41,430 --> 00:31:43,530
is like another use case where there is

686
00:31:43,530 --> 00:31:46,080
for example like I have like my API is

687
00:31:46,080 --> 00:31:49,140
not leaking any PII band it's probably

688
00:31:49,140 --> 00:31:50,670
like I have like a developer the just

689
00:31:50,670 --> 00:31:52,650
put the print statement and like that

690
00:31:52,650 --> 00:31:54,750
print statement is just like login PII

691
00:31:54,750 --> 00:31:56,910
in an elastic search cluster or whatever

692
00:31:56,910 --> 00:31:57,810
mhm

693
00:31:57,810 --> 00:31:59,400
that is actually like a login this

694
00:31:59,400 --> 00:32:01,080
information in a place where it's not

695
00:32:01,080 --> 00:32:03,000
supposed to be right like in an insecure

696
00:32:03,000 --> 00:32:05,160
place that likely just like somewhere

697
00:32:05,160 --> 00:32:07,590
else from the API but like based on this

698
00:32:07,590 --> 00:32:09,510
model do you think that it would be

699
00:32:09,510 --> 00:32:11,160
possible to actually set up like some

700
00:32:11,160 --> 00:32:13,710
integration to actually check like if

701
00:32:13,710 --> 00:32:15,750
there is because I know that like my

702
00:32:15,750 --> 00:32:17,970
macro service or whatever like my API is

703
00:32:17,970 --> 00:32:19,680
actually connected to an asset search

704
00:32:19,680 --> 00:32:21,870
cluster right so like do you think it

705
00:32:21,870 --> 00:32:24,030
will be possible to integrate this with

706
00:32:24,030 --> 00:32:25,860
that elastic search class that I'm just

707
00:32:25,860 --> 00:32:28,020
like make like the same kind of request

708
00:32:28,020 --> 00:32:30,270
like whatever like like and just like

709
00:32:30,270 --> 00:32:32,850
check if my PII is ending up in places

710
00:32:32,850 --> 00:32:35,580
where it's not supposed to end up so you

711
00:32:35,580 --> 00:32:37,220
mean in terms of for instance just

712
00:32:37,220 --> 00:32:40,020
checking or classifying maybe Jason

713
00:32:40,020 --> 00:32:42,600
messages that are not necessarily API

714
00:32:42,600 --> 00:32:45,390
requests or responses could be documents

715
00:32:45,390 --> 00:32:47,040
or a story in the file server or

716
00:32:47,040 --> 00:32:47,850
something like that

717
00:32:47,850 --> 00:32:50,040
anylock really maybe I'm logging this

718
00:32:50,040 --> 00:32:52,140
kind of stuff it actually the demo I'm

719
00:32:52,140 --> 00:32:54,330
gonna provide it it's not you know it's

720
00:32:54,330 --> 00:32:57,390
not going to use live API requests it's

721
00:32:57,390 --> 00:32:59,640
just pulling API requests from there

722
00:32:59,640 --> 00:33:02,400
from a folder so you can actually you

723
00:33:02,400 --> 00:33:05,160
can actually use pull these you know

724
00:33:05,160 --> 00:33:07,920
it's just JSON payloads so as long as

725
00:33:07,920 --> 00:33:10,980
using JSON it's fine if you want to for

726
00:33:10,980 --> 00:33:12,990
it if you have XML you have to implement

727
00:33:12,990 --> 00:33:15,960
your own parser okay because right now

728
00:33:15,960 --> 00:33:18,600
we the only constraint says that it has

729
00:33:18,600 --> 00:33:21,990
to be Jason okay but this Jason can be

730
00:33:21,990 --> 00:33:24,600
any work store anywhere and you can use

731
00:33:24,600 --> 00:33:26,280
just an API if you don't want to use the

732
00:33:26,280 --> 00:33:28,200
command line interface you can just use

733
00:33:28,200 --> 00:33:32,010
it as a sort of library you can just

734
00:33:32,010 --> 00:33:34,380
grab the model and just use cameras if

735
00:33:34,380 --> 00:33:36,150
you want to run the prediction whatever

736
00:33:36,150 --> 00:33:37,070
you want how

737
00:33:37,070 --> 00:33:40,970
it's it's there's no there's no

738
00:33:40,970 --> 00:33:43,340
restriction in terms of how you can run

739
00:33:43,340 --> 00:33:44,840
this classification process

740
00:33:44,840 --> 00:33:52,149
alright thanks boys yeah

741
00:33:52,470 --> 00:33:56,520
yeah yeah I have another question so in

742
00:33:56,520 --> 00:33:58,500
terms of the model itself how does it

743
00:33:58,500 --> 00:34:00,960
deal with outliers and how would you

744
00:34:00,960 --> 00:34:03,140
handle for example changes on the

745
00:34:03,140 --> 00:34:06,540
definition of the personal data if

746
00:34:06,540 --> 00:34:09,510
something like in terms of policy

747
00:34:09,510 --> 00:34:12,960
changes to a little more fields yeah

748
00:34:12,960 --> 00:34:15,480
that's a good question as I mentioned

749
00:34:15,480 --> 00:34:21,120
before go back here you can there's

750
00:34:21,120 --> 00:34:23,159
there's a configuration descriptor for

751
00:34:23,159 --> 00:34:25,080
now where you can you can configure your

752
00:34:25,080 --> 00:34:28,139
what what is known is we know using

753
00:34:28,139 --> 00:34:30,210
Python it's called faker so it's pretty

754
00:34:30,210 --> 00:34:32,400
much those are like components building

755
00:34:32,400 --> 00:34:33,870
blocks that you can use to generate fake

756
00:34:33,870 --> 00:34:36,239
data and this can be customized so if

757
00:34:36,239 --> 00:34:37,530
you want to generate social security

758
00:34:37,530 --> 00:34:39,360
number you can use the social security

759
00:34:39,360 --> 00:34:41,219
number faker or whatever so if you have

760
00:34:41,219 --> 00:34:43,980
a specific data type that you want to

761
00:34:43,980 --> 00:34:45,960
handle like let's say maybe health

762
00:34:45,960 --> 00:34:48,389
record ID or something like that you can

763
00:34:48,389 --> 00:34:50,699
build your own faker that's in terms of

764
00:34:50,699 --> 00:34:53,639
the synthetic data set okay and then if

765
00:34:53,639 --> 00:34:56,190
you have your own let's say open API

766
00:34:56,190 --> 00:34:58,170
format and you wanna you wanna add the

767
00:34:58,170 --> 00:35:00,770
model to know that you can just you know

768
00:35:00,770 --> 00:35:03,870
injected into the catalogue so pretty

769
00:35:03,870 --> 00:35:06,720
much the the data saturation process is

770
00:35:06,720 --> 00:35:09,210
pulling it's pulling all the all these

771
00:35:09,210 --> 00:35:11,340
descriptors you know from from this

772
00:35:11,340 --> 00:35:13,290
category so just you can just add it to

773
00:35:13,290 --> 00:35:15,570
the color and that way it will learn how

774
00:35:15,570 --> 00:35:19,440
your your your specific Jason message or

775
00:35:19,440 --> 00:35:23,280
payloads look like okay so so it's a and

776
00:35:23,280 --> 00:35:24,990
then if you want to remove you know kind

777
00:35:24,990 --> 00:35:26,340
of be do something more sophisticated

778
00:35:26,340 --> 00:35:29,490
you can just work at the labeling phase

779
00:35:29,490 --> 00:35:31,430
and you can use

780
00:35:31,430 --> 00:35:32,569
you know natural language processing

781
00:35:32,569 --> 00:35:34,999
capabilities and and also introduced the

782
00:35:34,999 --> 00:35:38,359
you know human okay so that you make

783
00:35:38,359 --> 00:35:40,190
sure that the model there you know has a

784
00:35:40,190 --> 00:35:42,200
you know improves in terms of quality

785
00:35:42,200 --> 00:35:45,589
you know the prediction okay thanks so

786
00:35:45,589 --> 00:35:48,440
that's let me see if I have some time I

787
00:35:48,440 --> 00:35:51,920
just don't want to it's gotta be yeah I

788
00:35:51,920 --> 00:35:57,140
have three more minutes so let me see if

789
00:35:57,140 --> 00:35:59,890
I can switch

790
00:36:04,140 --> 00:36:08,660
actually interesting let me see if I can

791
00:36:15,420 --> 00:36:19,880
okay now I'm seeing while you're seeing

792
00:36:20,330 --> 00:36:23,590
okay now let's

793
00:36:24,029 --> 00:36:28,660
okay this is just you know there's

794
00:36:28,660 --> 00:36:31,059
there's a comment which is a shell

795
00:36:31,059 --> 00:36:35,529
common I'm gonna you know it's Python so

796
00:36:35,529 --> 00:36:38,019
what I'm gonna do I'm gonna run the

797
00:36:38,019 --> 00:36:40,539
prediction task on top of a bunch of

798
00:36:40,539 --> 00:36:43,719
JSON requests that I have okay

799
00:36:43,719 --> 00:36:46,119
and I let me let me try to expand this a

800
00:36:46,119 --> 00:36:52,809
little bit okay it's not that bad so I'm

801
00:36:52,809 --> 00:36:56,410
gonna run this then I can show you don't

802
00:36:56,410 --> 00:36:58,079
worry about about the the warnings

803
00:36:58,079 --> 00:37:02,829
typical impotence of things so the

804
00:37:02,829 --> 00:37:05,140
important thing is here the model is

805
00:37:05,140 --> 00:37:07,390
generated is loaded you know this has

806
00:37:07,390 --> 00:37:09,160
already been trained with generating

807
00:37:09,160 --> 00:37:11,140
predictions and then they put you know

808
00:37:11,140 --> 00:37:13,479
and the prediction of story in a CSV

809
00:37:13,479 --> 00:37:18,489
file okay so predictions are here okay

810
00:37:18,489 --> 00:37:21,729
so we're gonna we're going to type these

811
00:37:21,729 --> 00:37:26,019
predictions we can we can see an you

812
00:37:26,019 --> 00:37:28,359
know D JSON payload but what is this

813
00:37:28,359 --> 00:37:30,430
saying this is magenta which has a lot

814
00:37:30,430 --> 00:37:33,130
of PII actually is consider P is costly

815
00:37:33,130 --> 00:37:35,529
PII you see this one it's actually flag

816
00:37:35,529 --> 00:37:37,779
saying yeah it's PII and this is the

817
00:37:37,779 --> 00:37:41,619
probability 92 percent that is PII and

818
00:37:41,619 --> 00:37:43,479
then there's an Atlassian Jason which is

819
00:37:43,479 --> 00:37:46,809
just a random in Atlassian Jireh you

820
00:37:46,809 --> 00:37:49,569
know confluence is just just kind of

821
00:37:49,569 --> 00:37:52,599
standard Jason with no personal data and

822
00:37:52,599 --> 00:37:54,489
you can see that it says that it's not

823
00:37:54,489 --> 00:37:59,559
PII okay it's zero and and and then the

824
00:37:59,559 --> 00:38:01,479
other this is other it's just a misc

825
00:38:01,479 --> 00:38:03,969
also J so we can we can see as some of

826
00:38:03,969 --> 00:38:06,309
these Rob this also makes an Alexa as

827
00:38:06,309 --> 00:38:08,739
you can see it's labeled as one ninety

828
00:38:08,739 --> 00:38:10,119
two percent that is has PII

829
00:38:10,119 --> 00:38:12,609
let me let's see for instance Magento

830
00:38:12,609 --> 00:38:14,650
okay this is where where this is coming

831
00:38:14,650 --> 00:38:16,859
from

832
00:38:17,880 --> 00:38:21,670
see has a lot of information by your

833
00:38:21,670 --> 00:38:25,290
first name last name region California

834
00:38:25,290 --> 00:38:28,210
so it's pretty much saying this looks

835
00:38:28,210 --> 00:38:31,089
pretty much as as PII okay and then we

836
00:38:31,089 --> 00:38:34,750
can see for instance let's see route you

837
00:38:34,750 --> 00:38:37,660
know so kind of going going back to to

838
00:38:37,660 --> 00:38:39,550
your one of the questions I think the

839
00:38:39,550 --> 00:38:41,980
first question was was whether you know

840
00:38:41,980 --> 00:38:44,920
you could you could use these for for a

841
00:38:44,920 --> 00:38:47,109
general purpose task yeah you can you

842
00:38:47,109 --> 00:38:49,480
can't this is just a route definition

843
00:38:49,480 --> 00:38:52,270
it's not even it's not even if this is

844
00:38:52,270 --> 00:38:53,800
like a descriptor and you can still run

845
00:38:53,800 --> 00:38:57,510
the PIAA process on top of that okay and

846
00:38:57,510 --> 00:39:04,210
let's see an X is also Jason and well

847
00:39:04,210 --> 00:39:06,490
it's singles here that this has PII its

848
00:39:06,490 --> 00:39:08,710
can be questionable but it's seen that

849
00:39:08,710 --> 00:39:12,099
there is a user user ID it's technically

850
00:39:12,099 --> 00:39:15,700
you know it's its sequence its little

851
00:39:15,700 --> 00:39:17,830
bit and anonymize but still they thinks

852
00:39:17,830 --> 00:39:20,980
that that this is kind of a confidential

853
00:39:20,980 --> 00:39:22,450
which it just selects so it's not that

854
00:39:22,450 --> 00:39:26,140
bad that is saying that but answering

855
00:39:26,140 --> 00:39:28,750
the second question here's here's how

856
00:39:28,750 --> 00:39:32,700
you can you can actually define all the

857
00:39:32,700 --> 00:39:35,440
all the fakers you know I mentioned

858
00:39:35,440 --> 00:39:37,359
before you can say for instance you know

859
00:39:37,359 --> 00:39:39,609
full name you want to use the full name

860
00:39:39,609 --> 00:39:41,470
faker but if you want to use a different

861
00:39:41,470 --> 00:39:43,630
one you can implement your own on top of

862
00:39:43,630 --> 00:39:44,859
the fakers library

863
00:39:44,859 --> 00:39:46,330
you know figures it's a it's a very

864
00:39:46,330 --> 00:39:48,580
known pie in our library so if you're

865
00:39:48,580 --> 00:39:50,650
not happy with the default ones you know

866
00:39:50,650 --> 00:39:52,540
and as you can see this is really really

867
00:39:52,540 --> 00:39:56,320
really basic you know I just enter you

868
00:39:56,320 --> 00:39:58,240
know like credit card just basic basic

869
00:39:58,240 --> 00:40:01,240
stuff but this is you should you know

870
00:40:01,240 --> 00:40:03,670
this should be much more complex in case

871
00:40:03,670 --> 00:40:05,290
you want to make it you know real world

872
00:40:05,290 --> 00:40:08,230
and you know it can pretty much also

873
00:40:08,230 --> 00:40:11,710
detect types so you can you can you can

874
00:40:11,710 --> 00:40:14,109
also based on time you can have your own

875
00:40:14,109 --> 00:40:17,170
generators and and that's that's that's

876
00:40:17,170 --> 00:40:18,520
how it works there's much more but you

877
00:40:18,520 --> 00:40:20,830
can you can just go to the website and

878
00:40:20,830 --> 00:40:23,500
there's more documentation on on that

879
00:40:23,500 --> 00:40:25,869
and and then I you know open source the

880
00:40:25,869 --> 00:40:27,190
whole thing so you can also generate

881
00:40:27,190 --> 00:40:28,180
data

882
00:40:28,180 --> 00:40:30,400
called the whole data set generator is

883
00:40:30,400 --> 00:40:33,490
also open source it's everything it's

884
00:40:33,490 --> 00:40:36,190
you know with an apache license so you

885
00:40:36,190 --> 00:40:37,359
can do pretty much whatever you want you

886
00:40:37,359 --> 00:40:39,250
can sell a do whatever you form with it

887
00:40:39,250 --> 00:40:43,240
okay I think I'm done let's see if we

888
00:40:43,240 --> 00:40:45,880
have any question but I think I have to

889
00:40:45,880 --> 00:40:50,079
leave room for the other speaker we have

890
00:40:50,079 --> 00:40:54,369
a couple of more minutes or yeah let's

891
00:40:54,369 --> 00:41:00,970
see if if we can if we have any any any

892
00:41:00,970 --> 00:41:09,400
question already hello

893
00:41:09,400 --> 00:41:14,109
yeah how's it going you and other other

894
00:41:14,109 --> 00:41:16,920
tools like they seem to be focused on

895
00:41:16,920 --> 00:41:20,500
focused on like feels like names or post

896
00:41:20,500 --> 00:41:23,290
codes or social security numbers like

897
00:41:23,290 --> 00:41:25,630
dependent fields can also be personal

898
00:41:25,630 --> 00:41:27,819
data so where I have like a collection

899
00:41:27,819 --> 00:41:29,440
of information on its own that isn't

900
00:41:29,440 --> 00:41:32,200
like personal data the combination can

901
00:41:32,200 --> 00:41:35,740
be identifiable yeah do you consider

902
00:41:35,740 --> 00:41:40,150
that in your product this is this is yet

903
00:41:40,150 --> 00:41:42,099
pretty simple you think about like a

904
00:41:42,099 --> 00:41:44,619
sort of I would say it's still like a

905
00:41:44,619 --> 00:41:46,450
prototype but if you want to implement

906
00:41:46,450 --> 00:41:49,540
that it's part I would say it's part of

907
00:41:49,540 --> 00:41:51,790
the labeling process so you can you can

908
00:41:51,790 --> 00:41:53,140
actually say for instance social

909
00:41:53,140 --> 00:41:55,270
security number it's linked to this

910
00:41:55,270 --> 00:41:56,859
other field let's say it could be

911
00:41:56,859 --> 00:42:01,299
information about your whatever your

912
00:42:01,299 --> 00:42:04,390
maybe you know the account the bank

913
00:42:04,390 --> 00:42:05,859
account or something related with your

914
00:42:05,859 --> 00:42:07,569
you know where you want your your

915
00:42:07,569 --> 00:42:11,170
security you know your money to go for

916
00:42:11,170 --> 00:42:12,700
instance so you could eventually link

917
00:42:12,700 --> 00:42:15,490
that I would what I would work there's a

918
00:42:15,490 --> 00:42:18,609
toolkit called called snorkel it's

919
00:42:18,609 --> 00:42:20,799
there's a whole branch in machine

920
00:42:20,799 --> 00:42:22,420
learning which is called data

921
00:42:22,420 --> 00:42:24,520
programming okay so their problem is

922
00:42:24,520 --> 00:42:27,069
pretty much creating synthetic data sets

923
00:42:27,069 --> 00:42:30,369
you know and and this this is this very

924
00:42:30,369 --> 00:42:33,430
popular toolkits called snorkel I would

925
00:42:33,430 --> 00:42:37,089
really check it out and then with that

926
00:42:37,089 --> 00:42:39,250
you can actually do even something more

927
00:42:39,250 --> 00:42:40,339
interesting you can

928
00:42:40,339 --> 00:42:41,690
can apply natural language processing

929
00:42:41,690 --> 00:42:43,969
techniques so it can be a little bit

930
00:42:43,969 --> 00:42:46,729
more fuzzy than just connecting you know

931
00:42:46,729 --> 00:42:49,369
dependent fields so you can say well I

932
00:42:49,369 --> 00:42:51,140
find a social security number and these

933
00:42:51,140 --> 00:42:55,069
also term is close okay it's closer it's

934
00:42:55,069 --> 00:42:57,259
closer maybe it doesn't match SSN

935
00:42:57,259 --> 00:42:58,999
specifically maybe it's match social

936
00:42:58,999 --> 00:43:00,739
security number and you can extract more

937
00:43:00,739 --> 00:43:02,479
semantics we then I'll be in techniques

938
00:43:02,479 --> 00:43:04,940
and once you extract more semantics you

939
00:43:04,940 --> 00:43:08,210
can level label your datasets better

940
00:43:08,210 --> 00:43:10,880
okay so that's that's what I would

941
00:43:10,880 --> 00:43:12,619
strongly suggest if you want to go kind

942
00:43:12,619 --> 00:43:14,930
of real war you want to you want to make

943
00:43:14,930 --> 00:43:17,089
sure that the labeling means very

944
00:43:17,089 --> 00:43:19,969
specific to your domain your business so

945
00:43:19,969 --> 00:43:22,130
and I would strongly suggest using LLP

946
00:43:22,130 --> 00:43:24,259
and snorkel it's a great way to start

947
00:43:24,259 --> 00:43:25,969
without snorkel it works really good

948
00:43:25,969 --> 00:43:27,920
it's one of the upgrades we are thinking

949
00:43:27,920 --> 00:43:30,319
of but right now this is just when a

950
00:43:30,319 --> 00:43:32,719
prototype we're working on a kind of on

951
00:43:32,719 --> 00:43:35,269
a product on a different area connected

952
00:43:35,269 --> 00:43:36,979
but quite different but I would I would

953
00:43:36,979 --> 00:43:39,650
check that it's called snorkel it's just

954
00:43:39,650 --> 00:43:41,839
really simple source on get have a great

955
00:43:41,839 --> 00:43:45,589
great product so I think the questions

956
00:43:45,589 --> 00:43:47,989
are open but I have to leave so I will I

957
00:43:47,989 --> 00:43:49,700
will keep answering questions so you can

958
00:43:49,700 --> 00:43:52,279
you know leave it open until tomorrow so

959
00:43:52,279 --> 00:43:56,660
you know just log into slider and PBDEs

960
00:43:56,660 --> 00:43:59,569
the the keyboard okay I'll try to follow

961
00:43:59,569 --> 00:44:01,549
up you know with everything any question

962
00:44:01,549 --> 00:44:10,309
you have okay thank you so much for

963
00:44:10,309 --> 00:44:11,569
anyone that likes to join us we are

964
00:44:11,569 --> 00:44:14,089
doing an AMA with Alisa the keynote

965
00:44:14,089 --> 00:44:15,890
speaker in the community corner but

966
00:44:15,890 --> 00:44:19,118
there is a coffee break now
