00:00:24,960 --> 00:00:27,439
dev second in London really memorable

7
00:00:27,439 --> 00:00:30,840
and obviously it was definitely

8
00:00:30,840 --> 00:00:33,510
memorable for some of us who had to cram

9
00:00:33,510 --> 00:00:35,460
a lot of late evenings in the last week

10
00:00:35,460 --> 00:00:38,640
but what's next well you've seen this

11
00:00:38,640 --> 00:00:41,100
slide with plenty of dates that where

12
00:00:41,100 --> 00:00:43,860
we're going to be doing dev SEC on next

13
00:00:43,860 --> 00:00:46,559
year the penultimate one there dev SEC

14
00:00:46,559 --> 00:00:49,020
on London September 30th to October 1st

15
00:00:49,020 --> 00:00:52,289
the news already booked in it's going to

16
00:00:52,289 --> 00:00:54,780
be the design no was at the BDC the

17
00:00:54,780 --> 00:00:57,890
business design centre in angel we have

18
00:00:57,890 --> 00:01:01,920
we have under under good get information

19
00:01:01,920 --> 00:01:04,319
that their their accounts seem

20
00:01:04,319 --> 00:01:07,080
reasonable so hopefully we won't have a

21
00:01:07,080 --> 00:01:10,850
late shock like last time one big

22
00:01:10,850 --> 00:01:14,070
important thing for us is that is that

23
00:01:14,070 --> 00:01:16,439
you know we want people to provide us

24
00:01:16,439 --> 00:01:19,080
with feedback and the feedback that we

25
00:01:19,080 --> 00:01:21,360
want is really about a sessions about

26
00:01:21,360 --> 00:01:23,909
the the way that the day's been

27
00:01:23,909 --> 00:01:26,729
structured about the content about the

28
00:01:26,729 --> 00:01:29,340
speakers about the food about the venue

29
00:01:29,340 --> 00:01:31,500
about the accessibility what would you

30
00:01:31,500 --> 00:01:33,509
change to make the conference better

31
00:01:33,509 --> 00:01:37,079
also from from my personal snick point

32
00:01:37,079 --> 00:01:39,930
of view I really want to know what you

33
00:01:39,930 --> 00:01:42,390
thought about the snick acquisition as

34
00:01:42,390 --> 00:01:45,450
well as whether you felt like you know

35
00:01:45,450 --> 00:01:47,610
the conference was too sneaky or not

36
00:01:47,610 --> 00:01:50,220
sneaky enough or just right so please do

37
00:01:50,220 --> 00:01:52,799
give us that feedback and keep us keep

38
00:01:52,799 --> 00:01:54,600

in and around the world and we've got

45
00:02:15,990 --> 00:02:18,240
some awards that we want to give out to

46
00:02:18,240 --> 00:02:20,340
individuals and I'm gonna go through

47
00:02:20,340 --> 00:02:22,080
each one and we're going to give them

48
00:02:22,080 --> 00:02:25,410
out - well I believe one of them is here

49
00:02:25,410 --> 00:02:27,390
others maybe around the globe but the

50
00:02:27,390 --> 00:02:29,430
first one is the outstanding deaf

51
00:02:29,430 --> 00:02:32,340

54
00:02:35,550 --> 00:02:38,400
around London and virtually as well and

55
00:02:38,400 --> 00:02:41,070
I know how hard it is to run these

56
00:02:41,070 --> 00:02:43,470
communities firsthand how much how much

57
00:02:43,470 --> 00:02:45,720
time it takes and you know it's very

58
00:02:45,720 --> 00:02:48,000
very rare that we find people who run

59
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:49,320
these communities actually do it as

60
00:02:49,320 --> 00:02:50,880
their roles a lot of people are doing it

61
00:02:50,880 --> 00:02:52,710

109
00:05:10,090 --> 00:05:12,790
MongoDB and Telstra and the most

110
00:05:12,790 --> 00:05:14,710
