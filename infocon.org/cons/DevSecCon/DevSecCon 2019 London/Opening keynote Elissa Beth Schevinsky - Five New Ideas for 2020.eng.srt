1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:06,740

right I'm so pleased to be here today at

4
00:00:15,780 --> 00:00:18,720
Def Con which is I think really one of

5
00:00:18,720 --> 00:00:20,369
the coolest security conferences

6
00:00:20,369 --> 00:00:23,609
developer conferences Jeff's a cop's all

7
00:00:23,609 --> 00:00:27,119
of it together very special what we've

8
00:00:27,119 --> 00:00:28,680
built or what they've built here over

9
00:00:28,680 --> 00:00:31,439
the last few years and since it is

10
00:00:31,439 --> 00:00:34,739

13
00:00:44,309 --> 00:00:45,149
the stage

14
00:00:45,149 --> 00:00:48,090
I've abdicated that privacy and also um

15
00:00:48,090 --> 00:00:50,399
I don't want it right like please quote

20
00:01:00,719 --> 00:01:03,510
to attack my company as well but for the

21
00:01:03,510 --> 00:01:06,659
other attendees if someone says

22
00:01:06,659 --> 00:01:10,170
something during this talk just get

23
00:01:10,170 --> 00:01:11,970
their permission before you take a photo

24
00:01:11,970 --> 00:01:14,250
or quote them just so people feel so

25
00:01:14,250 --> 00:01:16,140
you'll feel comfortable to share a

26
00:01:16,140 --> 00:01:18,030
little bit so the extent that it gets

27
00:01:18,030 --> 00:01:22,549
interactive so we're at a birthday party

28
00:01:22,549 --> 00:01:25,229
like a grown-up adult nerd birthday

29
00:01:25,229 --> 00:01:28,790
party and that's I think something

30
00:01:28,790 --> 00:01:34,380
special and I took a look back into

31
00:01:34,380 --> 00:01:38,250
DEFCON over the years and you can see

32
00:01:38,250 --> 00:01:40,259
the growth but a lot of things are still

33
00:01:40,259 --> 00:01:43,229
the same we're still happy to be here

34
00:01:43,229 --> 00:01:45,840
hanging out I think some of them were in

35
00:01:45,840 --> 00:01:49,320
warmer venues I brought my coat I almost

36
00:01:49,320 --> 00:01:51,229
thought I would wear it on stage

37
00:01:51,229 --> 00:01:54,630
and there's a lot that's still the same

38
00:01:54,630 --> 00:01:57,600
in terms of messaging def ii was really

39
00:01:57,600 --> 00:02:00,810
like one of the first places and events

40
00:02:00,810 --> 00:02:03,390
talking about like continuous security

41
00:02:03,390 --> 00:02:07,110
and shifting laughed the logos still the

42
00:02:07,110 --> 00:02:08,550
same I thought that's cool

43
00:02:08,550 --> 00:02:12,000
although the t-shirts have changed

44
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:16,239
and of course deficit con is about to do

45
00:02:16,239 --> 00:02:18,610
a lot so it's really cool to be here

46
00:02:18,610 --> 00:02:20,680
like at this moment where we're watching

47
00:02:20,680 --> 00:02:24,099
that happen so a round of applause right

48
00:02:24,099 --> 00:02:28,079
late for Def Con on the fifth birthday

49
00:02:30,160 --> 00:02:33,310
I'm not going to sing that I considered

50
00:02:33,310 --> 00:02:36,850
it so maybe later we sing happy birthday

51
00:02:36,850 --> 00:02:40,900
song for deaf second but not me

52
00:02:40,900 --> 00:02:43,390
you you sing if someone wants to

53
00:02:43,390 --> 00:02:45,940
volunteer to sing as we get if we have

54
00:02:45,940 --> 00:02:49,630
more time I think maybe Francois would

55
00:02:49,630 --> 00:02:53,560
appreciate it I did want to highlight

56
00:02:53,560 --> 00:02:57,550
I've got this AMA at 11:00 you can ask

57
00:02:57,550 --> 00:03:00,070
me anything anything I don't have to

58
00:03:00,070 --> 00:03:02,800
answer but you can ask anything so as we

59
00:03:02,800 --> 00:03:04,240
go through the talk think about what you

60
00:03:04,240 --> 00:03:07,840
might want to ask and then just like a

61
00:03:07,840 --> 00:03:11,050
lot of other cool AMAs so stick around

62
00:03:11,050 --> 00:03:15,810
and in case you didn't get the URL

63
00:03:15,810 --> 00:03:18,520
here's actually a moment if you want to

64
00:03:18,520 --> 00:03:21,160
take out your phones right now I will

65
00:03:21,160 --> 00:03:23,830
not be offended and sign up for the

66
00:03:23,830 --> 00:03:26,500
community and that way you know we can

67
00:03:26,500 --> 00:03:28,480
all connect with each other over that

68
00:03:28,480 --> 00:03:30,700
over the next two days and it seems

69
00:03:30,700 --> 00:03:35,080
pretty cool so we have free Wi-Fi no

70
00:03:35,080 --> 00:03:37,090
security you can take your phone out and

71
00:03:37,090 --> 00:03:41,340
get signed up all right all of that

72
00:03:41,340 --> 00:03:44,520
administrative deficit con stuff done I

73
00:03:44,520 --> 00:03:47,980
think the first thing I want to know

74
00:03:47,980 --> 00:03:50,530
when I come to an event like this is who

75
00:03:50,530 --> 00:03:53,700
else is here right like who are you

76
00:03:53,700 --> 00:03:57,700
especially because it's not like this is

77
00:03:57,700 --> 00:04:00,670
Python con or like PyCon you know it's a

78
00:04:00,670 --> 00:04:04,480
mix of people so if you identify as a

79
00:04:04,480 --> 00:04:07,120
security engineer if that's you raise

80
00:04:07,120 --> 00:04:09,700
your hand that's not me I should put my

81
00:04:09,700 --> 00:04:12,700
hand down a little bit higher I've got

82
00:04:12,700 --> 00:04:16,420
all these lights cool and slightly

83
00:04:16,420 --> 00:04:20,260
different if you identify as hacker so I

84
00:04:20,260 --> 00:04:23,500
love how bad these images are I go

85
00:04:23,500 --> 00:04:26,830
looking for different like images of

86
00:04:26,830 --> 00:04:30,310
different types of like people or

87
00:04:30,310 --> 00:04:32,770
stereotypes and then I find graphics

88
00:04:32,770 --> 00:04:34,330
that are so bad that I don't want to

89
00:04:34,330 --> 00:04:35,830
include them I shouldn't share with you

90
00:04:35,830 --> 00:04:37,840
but I can't hold it this is it's

91
00:04:37,840 --> 00:04:39,590
terrible

92
00:04:39,590 --> 00:04:43,349
so yeah not a lot of people identifying

93
00:04:43,349 --> 00:04:47,060
as hacker the images for lady hacker in

94
00:04:47,060 --> 00:04:50,970
contrast are amazing if you go to a

95
00:04:50,970 --> 00:04:53,490
search for lady hacker it's great

96
00:04:53,490 --> 00:04:56,099
and these are actual like real hackers

97
00:04:56,099 --> 00:04:59,280
not just people posing so these are some

98
00:04:59,280 --> 00:05:01,169
less bad hacker graphics if you identify

99
00:05:01,169 --> 00:05:05,009
his lady hacker anyone here think maybe

100
00:05:05,009 --> 00:05:07,470
me a little bit I'll raise my hand this

101
00:05:07,470 --> 00:05:13,979
much if you're in DevOps yeah right this

102
00:05:13,979 --> 00:05:16,379
is kind of a DevOps conference can I see

103
00:05:16,379 --> 00:05:20,099
that again so if you're in DevOps and

104
00:05:20,099 --> 00:05:22,139
you're happy and you know it can you

105
00:05:22,139 --> 00:05:25,680
raise your hand according to this recent

106
00:05:25,680 --> 00:05:28,740
survey DevOps people are the happiest

107
00:05:28,740 --> 00:05:32,310
people they're really happy really

108
00:05:32,310 --> 00:05:34,020
really content don't want to leave their

109
00:05:34,020 --> 00:05:36,840
jobs so that's cold

110
00:05:36,840 --> 00:05:40,530
I just thought it was worth sharing now

111
00:05:40,530 --> 00:05:43,080
if you identify as a developer who here

112
00:05:43,080 --> 00:05:47,940
identifies as a developer this is my

113
00:05:47,940 --> 00:05:51,810
favorite image of a developer and I

114
00:05:51,810 --> 00:05:53,639
found it when I was looking for junior

115
00:05:53,639 --> 00:05:57,719
developer images but then I decided this

116
00:05:57,719 --> 00:06:00,840
is like senior developer cuz she's home

117
00:06:00,840 --> 00:06:03,210
she's got a cab on her head I think

118
00:06:03,210 --> 00:06:05,340
that's great that's like to me the

119
00:06:05,340 --> 00:06:08,969
highest level of what I aspire to in

120
00:06:08,969 --> 00:06:13,469
terms of my lifestyle all right so now I

121
00:06:13,469 --> 00:06:16,379
have a sense of who's here and we can

122
00:06:16,379 --> 00:06:21,360
get into some thoughts for 2020 to quote

123
00:06:21,360 --> 00:06:22,409
the good place

124
00:06:22,409 --> 00:06:25,379
everyone here has seen the good place or

125
00:06:25,379 --> 00:06:28,740
you know of it raise your hand if you

126
00:06:28,740 --> 00:06:30,770
have

127
00:06:30,879 --> 00:06:34,869
so the good place is a television show

128
00:06:34,869 --> 00:06:36,699
that actually dives pretty deep into

129
00:06:36,699 --> 00:06:39,369
philosophy and one of the questions they

130
00:06:39,369 --> 00:06:42,879
posed are what are our obligations to

131
00:06:42,879 --> 00:06:46,209
each other seems relevant to DevOps

132
00:06:46,209 --> 00:06:50,439
right relevant to working together but

133
00:06:50,439 --> 00:06:56,259
better yet better than is this better

134
00:06:56,259 --> 00:07:02,800
sound better now better yet what are the

135
00:07:02,800 --> 00:07:05,919
obligations of individual developers

136
00:07:05,919 --> 00:07:09,610
when it comes to security so I throw

137
00:07:09,610 --> 00:07:11,800
this question out at a lot of events and

138
00:07:11,800 --> 00:07:15,219
I get very different responses based on

139
00:07:15,219 --> 00:07:18,939
the composition of the room so if you

140
00:07:18,939 --> 00:07:20,619
believe that developers are responsible

141
00:07:20,619 --> 00:07:24,519
for security raise your hand is that

142
00:07:24,519 --> 00:07:26,800
everyone here yeah right like a lot of

143
00:07:26,800 --> 00:07:29,800
the room feels that that's part of what

144
00:07:29,800 --> 00:07:32,550
we're doing here

145
00:07:32,550 --> 00:07:36,219
and how does this change when you're

146
00:07:36,219 --> 00:07:39,119
part of a team does anyone have a

147
00:07:39,119 --> 00:07:41,110
perspective on this can I get some

148
00:07:41,110 --> 00:07:48,039
volunteers anyone what do you think if

149
00:07:48,039 --> 00:07:49,479
you're part of a team are you still

150
00:07:49,479 --> 00:07:51,249
responsible for security if you're a

151
00:07:51,249 --> 00:07:55,110
developer yeah

152
00:07:56,380 --> 00:07:59,470
ah it's so noisy with the heaters this

153
00:07:59,470 --> 00:08:01,720
may not work it may have to be just me

154
00:08:01,720 --> 00:08:05,860
talking the whole time okay so when I've

155
00:08:05,860 --> 00:08:08,800
given this talk the people who believe

156
00:08:08,800 --> 00:08:11,080
that maybe developers shouldn't be

157
00:08:11,080 --> 00:08:13,600
responsible for security the reason

158
00:08:13,600 --> 00:08:15,970
would be because there are other people

159
00:08:15,970 --> 00:08:18,400
on the team were assigned those tasks or

160
00:08:18,400 --> 00:08:21,340
they're relying on QA they're relying on

161
00:08:21,340 --> 00:08:27,570
you know security members I think that

162
00:08:27,570 --> 00:08:31,030
developers are responsible for security

163
00:08:31,030 --> 00:08:34,020
but I can hear the other point of view

164
00:08:34,020 --> 00:08:36,849
and you run into these questions and

165
00:08:36,849 --> 00:08:39,849
these challenges right like for those of

166
00:08:39,849 --> 00:08:42,460
you who follow Tania's talk in Seattle

167
00:08:42,460 --> 00:08:46,080
at Def Con in Seattle her thesis was

168
00:08:46,080 --> 00:08:49,990
security is everyone's tongue and so if

169
00:08:49,990 --> 00:08:52,690
we agree security is everyone's job what

170
00:08:52,690 --> 00:08:55,810
do we do next you know what do we do how

171
00:08:55,810 --> 00:08:59,110
do we actually solve that how do we make

172
00:08:59,110 --> 00:09:02,200
these collaborations work these are one

173
00:09:02,200 --> 00:09:04,150
of the hardest problems like we can get

174
00:09:04,150 --> 00:09:07,860
to where we agree that it's important

175
00:09:07,860 --> 00:09:12,550
but then why it's kind of an unsolved

176
00:09:12,550 --> 00:09:15,970
problem we're still figuring out what

177
00:09:15,970 --> 00:09:18,970
are the best practices and so I went to

178
00:09:18,970 --> 00:09:22,510
unsolved problems on Google I found this

179
00:09:22,510 --> 00:09:27,790
Wikipedia page cold cases violent major

180
00:09:27,790 --> 00:09:29,650
crimes you end up going down this little

181
00:09:29,650 --> 00:09:32,250
rabbit hole I had to pull myself back

182
00:09:32,250 --> 00:09:35,980
unfortunately we have Tosh Norris here

183
00:09:35,980 --> 00:09:38,560
who's actually going to be helpful and

184
00:09:38,560 --> 00:09:41,010
provide hopefully some more solutions

185
00:09:41,010 --> 00:09:43,240
asking not only are we turning our

186
00:09:43,240 --> 00:09:46,870
engineers blue but in this talk we're

187
00:09:46,870 --> 00:09:48,820
going to cover how we turn these

188
00:09:48,820 --> 00:09:51,340
engineers blue and so I've come to this

189
00:09:51,340 --> 00:09:54,130
particular dev second a little bit

190
00:09:54,130 --> 00:09:56,860
worried about how difficult it is for us

191
00:09:56,860 --> 00:09:59,980
to all work together but I'm excited

192
00:09:59,980 --> 00:10:02,020
that maybe after some of the sessions

193
00:10:02,020 --> 00:10:04,910
I'll come out with some more answers

194
00:10:04,910 --> 00:10:09,170
so hopefully I'll see you there and for

195
00:10:09,170 --> 00:10:12,310
number three if you're keeping track

196
00:10:12,310 --> 00:10:16,250
this has been a really big issue how do

197
00:10:16,250 --> 00:10:20,710
we make open source security scalable

198
00:10:20,710 --> 00:10:23,510
there was a huge conference recently in

199
00:10:23,510 --> 00:10:26,480
San Francisco dealing with the

200
00:10:26,480 --> 00:10:28,670
relationship between corporations and

201
00:10:28,670 --> 00:10:31,790
open source and a lot of that

202
00:10:31,790 --> 00:10:34,640
conversation is about how open source is

203
00:10:34,640 --> 00:10:37,040
cool now for companies like ok we

204
00:10:37,040 --> 00:10:40,400
understand that but what our company is

205
00:10:40,400 --> 00:10:43,820
going to do for our open source is is

206
00:10:43,820 --> 00:10:47,630
this debate new to people anyone here

207
00:10:47,630 --> 00:10:49,580
who's learning this or getting into this

208
00:10:49,580 --> 00:10:52,340
for the first time anyone here who could

209
00:10:52,340 --> 00:10:56,170
summarize what what this issue has been

210
00:10:56,170 --> 00:10:58,400
around supporting open-source maintainer

211
00:10:58,400 --> 00:11:05,680
--zz do I know volunteers

212
00:11:07,100 --> 00:11:10,020
all right then I'll summarize basically

213
00:11:10,020 --> 00:11:12,600
we want open-source maintainer x' to be

214
00:11:12,600 --> 00:11:15,210
doing security but they don't

215
00:11:15,210 --> 00:11:16,800
necessarily have the money or the

216
00:11:16,800 --> 00:11:19,830
resources it's really hard that's part

217
00:11:19,830 --> 00:11:21,450
of why snake is doing everything that

218
00:11:21,450 --> 00:11:23,700
they're doing but if you get to the root

219
00:11:23,700 --> 00:11:27,360
cause we'd really like to support for

220
00:11:27,360 --> 00:11:29,070
individual maintainer x' to do it

221
00:11:29,070 --> 00:11:34,050
themselves and so my radical are

222
00:11:34,050 --> 00:11:36,690
hopefully not so a radical idea is that

223
00:11:36,690 --> 00:11:38,520
corporation should be taking on this

224
00:11:38,520 --> 00:11:40,680
responsibility and we're really not

225
00:11:40,680 --> 00:11:43,680
seeing it that companies are using these

226
00:11:43,680 --> 00:11:45,870
open-source tools they're benefiting

227
00:11:45,870 --> 00:11:48,000
from these open-source tools Facebook

228
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:50,190
Google Microsoft they have you know

229
00:11:50,190 --> 00:11:52,140
millions of dollars that could be

230
00:11:52,140 --> 00:11:55,290
allocated and it's just it hasn't

231
00:11:55,290 --> 00:11:57,570
happened yet why not

232
00:11:57,570 --> 00:11:59,400
one reason is there hasn't been

233
00:11:59,400 --> 00:12:03,090
community or collective pressure and so

234
00:12:03,090 --> 00:12:06,120
if those of you who are here think that

235
00:12:06,120 --> 00:12:08,040
this is important if you care about

236
00:12:08,040 --> 00:12:09,960
open-source security and you'd like to

237
00:12:09,960 --> 00:12:13,170
see companies doing more thing get in

238
00:12:13,170 --> 00:12:15,000
touch with me and we can figure out what

239
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:18,930
are some interesting next steps before I

240
00:12:18,930 --> 00:12:20,490
move on I think this is actually a

241
00:12:20,490 --> 00:12:24,210
really like juicy topic does anyone have

242
00:12:24,210 --> 00:12:26,190
any anecdote any story you'd want to

243
00:12:26,190 --> 00:12:31,610
share on this all right

244
00:12:34,080 --> 00:12:36,800
is open-source the new attack surface

245
00:12:36,800 --> 00:12:40,920
what did people think is there something

246
00:12:40,920 --> 00:12:42,570
that's a bigger attack surface right now

247
00:12:42,570 --> 00:12:50,430
than open-source can it's not new that's

248
00:12:50,430 --> 00:12:52,230
a good point it's not me right

249
00:12:52,230 --> 00:12:55,800
it's an old attack surface according to

250
00:12:55,800 --> 00:12:57,300
some reports that might be on the rise

251
00:12:57,300 --> 00:12:59,730
do you think that there's more more

252
00:12:59,730 --> 00:13:01,260
attack surface there than there used to

253
00:13:01,260 --> 00:13:05,070
be so old attack surface but maybe

254
00:13:05,070 --> 00:13:09,360
problem is escalating what do people

255
00:13:09,360 --> 00:13:13,110
think I see some nods any suggestions

256
00:13:13,110 --> 00:13:18,300
what can we do about it you're like not

257
00:13:18,300 --> 00:13:24,540
me anyone else part of my job here as a

258
00:13:24,540 --> 00:13:26,430
keynote is to like get us all excited

259
00:13:26,430 --> 00:13:29,220
for the two days we have ahead which was

260
00:13:29,220 --> 00:13:32,010
one reason I like this question our

261
00:13:32,010 --> 00:13:34,680
open-source developers Security's new

262
00:13:34,680 --> 00:13:38,430
front line today at 11:20 a.m. so you

263
00:13:38,430 --> 00:13:41,640
can go to my AMA and then you can go and

264
00:13:41,640 --> 00:13:45,810
see this talk before I move on to any

265
00:13:45,810 --> 00:13:47,930
other

266
00:13:51,900 --> 00:13:54,900
all right this one I am gonna insist on

267
00:13:54,900 --> 00:13:57,029
at least one volunteer what are your

268
00:13:57,029 --> 00:13:59,370
most difficult challenges in dev

269
00:13:59,370 --> 00:14:01,820
suck-ups

270
00:14:07,770 --> 00:14:10,050
mine is everyone working together I

271
00:14:10,050 --> 00:14:15,780
think that is just unsolved we've really

272
00:14:15,780 --> 00:14:17,430
figured out made so many advances

273
00:14:17,430 --> 00:14:19,650
technically and the human element just

274
00:14:19,650 --> 00:14:30,920
remains this frontier anyone else yes

275
00:14:32,030 --> 00:14:34,930
shout it

276
00:14:35,580 --> 00:14:41,910
the resistance wow it's so noisy say

277
00:14:41,910 --> 00:14:48,920
that one more time what does that mean

278
00:14:52,960 --> 00:14:57,250
ah we really would have needed another

279
00:14:57,250 --> 00:15:04,390
microphone I didn't catch that what

280
00:15:04,390 --> 00:15:06,130
we're trying to do and they fight it

281
00:15:06,130 --> 00:15:08,230
back because they don't comprehend it or

282
00:15:08,230 --> 00:15:10,960
they are just very comfortable with what

283
00:15:10,960 --> 00:15:13,060
is being done at the moment right

284
00:15:13,060 --> 00:15:15,190
there's resistance because people are

285
00:15:15,190 --> 00:15:18,070
comfortable yep and so how do we solve

286
00:15:18,070 --> 00:15:22,390
that that's education Mary right what do

287
00:15:22,390 --> 00:15:23,950
we do though if people don't want to be

288
00:15:23,950 --> 00:15:31,420
educated oh great question show them

289
00:15:31,420 --> 00:15:34,500
that that things actually work by

290
00:15:34,500 --> 00:15:37,090
measurements and show them how that

291
00:15:37,090 --> 00:15:38,830
things are gonna change and make their

292
00:15:38,830 --> 00:15:41,680
life easier right because if people

293
00:15:41,680 --> 00:15:44,590
already have an emotional feeling you

294
00:15:44,590 --> 00:15:46,900
can bring them along with the emotions

295
00:15:46,900 --> 00:15:49,210
they have but if not you can use data

296
00:15:49,210 --> 00:15:51,250
you can use data to show how it's

297
00:15:51,250 --> 00:15:55,810
relevant to them anyone else what are

298
00:15:55,810 --> 00:15:59,170
your most difficult challenges in dev

299
00:15:59,170 --> 00:16:05,130
suck-ups yes

300
00:16:08,320 --> 00:16:12,339
so we can give up so so we can give time

301
00:16:12,339 --> 00:16:14,410
to the developers to actually care about

302
00:16:14,410 --> 00:16:15,970
security because most developers include

303
00:16:15,970 --> 00:16:17,410
myself put hand up when we see huge

304
00:16:17,410 --> 00:16:20,560
developer that's me they they it's just

305
00:16:20,560 --> 00:16:22,660
not taught at university and

306
00:16:22,660 --> 00:16:24,160
historically it's something that you

307
00:16:24,160 --> 00:16:25,870
have to pick up an organization's expect

308
00:16:25,870 --> 00:16:28,269
you to just know and the security people

309
00:16:28,269 --> 00:16:30,310
often sometimes forget what it's like

310
00:16:30,310 --> 00:16:33,190
when you don't know so actually getting

311
00:16:33,190 --> 00:16:35,440
management to cut time out where people

312
00:16:35,440 --> 00:16:37,149
aren't doing features to actually learn

313
00:16:37,149 --> 00:16:38,769
about security to make the organization

314
00:16:38,769 --> 00:16:40,839
better from the ground up that's that's

315
00:16:40,839 --> 00:16:42,459
my biggest problem at the moment Wow

316
00:16:42,459 --> 00:16:45,339
well and developers need the time to do

317
00:16:45,339 --> 00:16:47,860
the testing and fix the issues too right

318
00:16:47,860 --> 00:16:50,290
so like even if you do know the security

319
00:16:50,290 --> 00:16:55,089
if you're rushed it store to do it so

320
00:16:55,089 --> 00:16:58,560
what are you going to do about it

321
00:16:58,560 --> 00:17:03,100
well it's ended up being my job so I I

322
00:17:03,100 --> 00:17:05,079
do security threat modeling with teams

323
00:17:05,079 --> 00:17:07,089
so I've got 40 developer teams that I've

324
00:17:07,089 --> 00:17:09,150
got to do stripe threat modeling with

325
00:17:09,150 --> 00:17:11,829
that geographically dispersed than at

326
00:17:11,829 --> 00:17:13,059
the moment I'm doing about we'll be

327
00:17:13,059 --> 00:17:16,890
doing about 46 Nate's helping me

328
00:17:16,890 --> 00:17:19,419
together with the security and we're

329
00:17:19,419 --> 00:17:21,040
trying to build that bridge between the

330
00:17:21,040 --> 00:17:22,839
developer community and the security

331
00:17:22,839 --> 00:17:27,099
people and it's hard because we're

332
00:17:27,099 --> 00:17:28,960
transitioning at the moment from from

333
00:17:28,960 --> 00:17:30,280
one space which is more of a sort of

334
00:17:30,280 --> 00:17:32,080
startup view to a more sustainable

335
00:17:32,080 --> 00:17:34,570
organization we've got a big deluge of

336
00:17:34,570 --> 00:17:37,540
open source library issues that we're

337
00:17:37,540 --> 00:17:39,130
trying to fix and we're trying to

338
00:17:39,130 --> 00:17:40,630
educate the development community and

339
00:17:40,630 --> 00:17:42,340
getting that reach into management so

340
00:17:42,340 --> 00:17:43,900
you need to care about this you're gonna

341
00:17:43,900 --> 00:17:45,370
have a long-term sustainable platform

342
00:17:45,370 --> 00:17:48,880
it's quite a challenge well well find me

343
00:17:48,880 --> 00:17:50,820
later I think that's really interesting

344
00:17:50,820 --> 00:17:54,040
and I have management point of view so

345
00:17:54,040 --> 00:17:57,880
maybe I can be helpful and I guess I'm

346
00:17:57,880 --> 00:17:59,530
inspired by you trying to do this that

347
00:17:59,530 --> 00:18:01,179
makes me happy that's like a great start

348
00:18:01,179 --> 00:18:01,890
to the day

349
00:18:01,890 --> 00:18:03,760
hopefully maybe some of you will be

350
00:18:03,760 --> 00:18:06,130
inspired as well to try to do this

351
00:18:06,130 --> 00:18:08,440
inside your organisations and thank you

352
00:18:08,440 --> 00:18:10,929
for sharing anyone else one more story

353
00:18:10,929 --> 00:18:13,490
from this side of the room over there

354
00:18:13,490 --> 00:18:15,710
I don't actually see anyone I'm just

355
00:18:15,710 --> 00:18:17,270
like calling on the general part of the

356
00:18:17,270 --> 00:18:21,320
room putting pressure it's a very bright

357
00:18:21,320 --> 00:18:26,840
light yes I guess for the most difficult

358
00:18:26,840 --> 00:18:28,549
challenges that I have right now as I

359
00:18:28,549 --> 00:18:31,700
see security validation being very

360
00:18:31,700 --> 00:18:34,340
waterfall why because when you talk

361
00:18:34,340 --> 00:18:37,700
about early validation or in either

362
00:18:37,700 --> 00:18:39,830
functional or non-functional with

363
00:18:39,830 --> 00:18:41,450
respect to security we're really you

364
00:18:41,450 --> 00:18:43,610
know looking at open source cans or you

365
00:18:43,610 --> 00:18:45,980
know static code scanning dynamic code

366
00:18:45,980 --> 00:18:48,529
scanning etc etc but if you say for

367
00:18:48,529 --> 00:18:50,149
example a SAS company and you're talking

368
00:18:50,149 --> 00:18:51,470
about the service going out in the

369
00:18:51,470 --> 00:18:54,559
market that parameter services how your

370
00:18:54,559 --> 00:18:56,390
application interacts from a service

371
00:18:56,390 --> 00:18:59,299
point of view that is all validated

372
00:18:59,299 --> 00:19:01,190
really at the end stages you know when

373
00:19:01,190 --> 00:19:03,169
you start talking about well you know

374
00:19:03,169 --> 00:19:04,909
we're a company we want to go from an

375
00:19:04,909 --> 00:19:07,220
on-prem to a sales organization let's

376
00:19:07,220 --> 00:19:08,899
build a service strategy now let's build

377
00:19:08,899 --> 00:19:11,299
the the cloud architecture the

378
00:19:11,299 --> 00:19:13,309
application somewhere fits you know in

379
00:19:13,309 --> 00:19:14,450
the middle of the architecture there's

380
00:19:14,450 --> 00:19:16,490
so many perfect you know periphery

381
00:19:16,490 --> 00:19:18,380
services that is talked to so it's a

382
00:19:18,380 --> 00:19:20,299
testing problem is what you're having

383
00:19:20,299 --> 00:19:23,510
it's not know I would say the whole

384
00:19:23,510 --> 00:19:25,309
security validation right I mean

385
00:19:25,309 --> 00:19:27,620
initially at the code level obviously

386
00:19:27,620 --> 00:19:29,840
the development teams are involved in

387
00:19:29,840 --> 00:19:32,809
things like early code scanning but

388
00:19:32,809 --> 00:19:34,730
there is a separate security team like a

389
00:19:34,730 --> 00:19:36,559
cloud security team for example who

390
00:19:36,559 --> 00:19:38,570
validates the overall security at the

391
00:19:38,570 --> 00:19:40,130
end stages of the service strategy

392
00:19:40,130 --> 00:19:41,990
wherein you figure out oh you know what

393
00:19:41,990 --> 00:19:44,059
there's a major problem we got PII in

394
00:19:44,059 --> 00:19:47,059
the application log data yeah so it kind

395
00:19:47,059 --> 00:19:49,130
of feels very waterfall you know in

396
00:19:49,130 --> 00:19:51,320
order to come back to a product which

397
00:19:51,320 --> 00:19:53,899
has been built 20 years ago and start

398
00:19:53,899 --> 00:19:56,960
talking about security refinements you

399
00:19:56,960 --> 00:19:58,530
know from my perspective

400
00:19:58,530 --> 00:20:02,039
interesting well find me later I'd be

401
00:20:02,039 --> 00:20:04,230
happy to dive into that a little bit

402
00:20:04,230 --> 00:20:05,760
more she's certainly an interesting

403
00:20:05,760 --> 00:20:09,120
challenge and good luck with that

404
00:20:09,120 --> 00:20:13,409
it's not easy yeah it is it is it's a

405
00:20:13,409 --> 00:20:15,690
lot of work it's just new things come

406
00:20:15,690 --> 00:20:17,940
you know round the circle you have to

407
00:20:17,940 --> 00:20:20,220
again start working on a Ryoka texture

408
00:20:20,220 --> 00:20:21,600
of your product which has been in the

409
00:20:21,600 --> 00:20:23,760
market for twenty years is just you know

410
00:20:23,760 --> 00:20:27,770
the time to market increases yeah so

411
00:20:28,340 --> 00:20:31,020
it's very hard when you have older

412
00:20:31,020 --> 00:20:33,570
applications legacy applications older

413
00:20:33,570 --> 00:20:36,990
companies I I do a lot of work around

414
00:20:36,990 --> 00:20:39,780
that and I think that's where devstack

415
00:20:39,780 --> 00:20:42,059
ops gets really interesting is you have

416
00:20:42,059 --> 00:20:44,429
these legacy companies legacy tacking

417
00:20:44,429 --> 00:20:46,890
like we're trying to now do continuous

418
00:20:46,890 --> 00:20:48,419
integration or trying to do continuous

419
00:20:48,419 --> 00:20:50,010
security we're trying to move into new

420
00:20:50,010 --> 00:20:52,890
things so I think Jeff's a cop's is an

421
00:20:52,890 --> 00:20:55,200
important movement for that but it's

422
00:20:55,200 --> 00:20:56,789
hard it's hard when you have really old

423
00:20:56,789 --> 00:20:59,700
stuff anyone one last story and then

424
00:20:59,700 --> 00:21:04,130
I'll move on I think that we got it okay

425
00:21:04,130 --> 00:21:07,140
yeah sorry I was in the process of

426
00:21:07,140 --> 00:21:09,390
standing I'm sorry please and so the

427
00:21:09,390 --> 00:21:11,130
biggest challenge I find of DevOps is a

428
00:21:11,130 --> 00:21:13,860
cultural issue so I work for a security

429
00:21:13,860 --> 00:21:15,809
team traditional banking infrastructure

430
00:21:15,809 --> 00:21:18,240
but I also act as a mediator with the

431
00:21:18,240 --> 00:21:20,610
DevOps community and I was brought in to

432
00:21:20,610 --> 00:21:23,070
do that mediation and the security team

433
00:21:23,070 --> 00:21:24,630
are continually saying you know we need

434
00:21:24,630 --> 00:21:26,610
to break down these silos and create a

435
00:21:26,610 --> 00:21:29,370
positive security culture which is what

436
00:21:29,370 --> 00:21:31,049
I've gone out and done and I've embedded

437
00:21:31,049 --> 00:21:32,760
myself within the DevOps team I've lived

438
00:21:32,760 --> 00:21:34,110
and breathed the pain and they've gone

439
00:21:34,110 --> 00:21:36,270
through but going back to the security

440
00:21:36,270 --> 00:21:37,919
team it's still very oh it's us and them

441
00:21:37,919 --> 00:21:40,020
and this is what I have into trouble

442
00:21:40,020 --> 00:21:41,100
with is actually going back to the

443
00:21:41,100 --> 00:21:42,809
security and say no we can't do these

444
00:21:42,809 --> 00:21:44,280
things if you want to implement these

445
00:21:44,280 --> 00:21:46,710
policies and these rules at least given

446
00:21:46,710 --> 00:21:47,970
alternative solutions that the

447
00:21:47,970 --> 00:21:51,010
developers don't get back look

448
00:21:51,010 --> 00:21:55,270
right so what do you think how do you

449
00:21:55,270 --> 00:21:57,340
solve that I'll just carry on doing what

450
00:21:57,340 --> 00:22:00,669
I'm doing and I was hired my manager my

451
00:22:00,669 --> 00:22:02,140
senior manager said to me don't go broke

452
00:22:02,140 --> 00:22:03,850
you can be my eyes and ears in the

453
00:22:03,850 --> 00:22:05,260
ground just don't go rogue and within

454
00:22:05,260 --> 00:22:07,059
three months had already gone rogue in

455
00:22:07,059 --> 00:22:09,429
her eyes because I started circumventing

456
00:22:09,429 --> 00:22:11,500
policies and circumventing rules that we

457
00:22:11,500 --> 00:22:13,510
had in place to get things through the

458
00:22:13,510 --> 00:22:15,730
pipeline but not putting security risk

459
00:22:15,730 --> 00:22:16,990
obviously that's what I'm there to do

460
00:22:16,990 --> 00:22:19,299
but I've driven a positive culture

461
00:22:19,299 --> 00:22:21,160
within deaf community and they're

462
00:22:21,160 --> 00:22:23,140
actually coming back to me saying

463
00:22:23,140 --> 00:22:24,040
they're getting better return of

464
00:22:24,040 --> 00:22:25,690
investment by the policies that I've

465
00:22:25,690 --> 00:22:28,059
changed so it's just about creating a

466
00:22:28,059 --> 00:22:30,160
more positive security awareness within

467
00:22:30,160 --> 00:22:33,669
the dev teams security themselves seem

468
00:22:33,669 --> 00:22:35,320
to think that developers are stupid and

469
00:22:35,320 --> 00:22:37,030
they're people they're not stupid

470
00:22:37,030 --> 00:22:38,500
they're just not aware as we've spoke

471
00:22:38,500 --> 00:22:40,030
already the of the security there needs

472
00:22:40,030 --> 00:22:41,980
to be embedded and if we can get that

473
00:22:41,980 --> 00:22:43,780
embedded and into their mindsets then we

474
00:22:43,780 --> 00:22:45,130
can actually create a more positive

475
00:22:45,130 --> 00:22:47,830
culture right well then people aren't

476
00:22:47,830 --> 00:22:49,720
stupid they're good at what they do and

477
00:22:49,720 --> 00:22:50,799
they're trained in what they do

478
00:22:50,799 --> 00:22:53,290
exactly Security's not a return on

479
00:22:53,290 --> 00:22:54,520
investment it's just something that has

480
00:22:54,520 --> 00:22:56,350
to be done right so security doesn't

481
00:22:56,350 --> 00:22:59,610
traditionally make money applications do

482
00:22:59,610 --> 00:23:02,890
well in developers have what you know

483
00:23:02,890 --> 00:23:04,660
they see as their jobs and sometimes

484
00:23:04,660 --> 00:23:07,840
what management is asking them to do so

485
00:23:07,840 --> 00:23:11,020
yeah I think it's I it's inspiring for

486
00:23:11,020 --> 00:23:12,460
me to hear people like you who are doing

487
00:23:12,460 --> 00:23:15,760
this one reason why I'm a founder and

488
00:23:15,760 --> 00:23:17,620
not an employee is it's really hard for

489
00:23:17,620 --> 00:23:23,110
me to not go rogue so I understand good

490
00:23:23,110 --> 00:23:26,650
kind of threading that needle and come

491
00:23:26,650 --> 00:23:28,210
find me later I'd be interested in

492
00:23:28,210 --> 00:23:29,500
hearing that story in a little more

493
00:23:29,500 --> 00:23:32,169
detail does anyone have any any thoughts

494
00:23:32,169 --> 00:23:34,630
on that well the problem exactly that

495
00:23:34,630 --> 00:23:35,980
you have is trying to figure out how to

496
00:23:35,980 --> 00:23:40,450
make the positive culture right but

497
00:23:40,450 --> 00:23:41,740
that's the thing you're trying to figure

498
00:23:41,740 --> 00:23:43,299
out how to make the positive culture

499
00:23:43,299 --> 00:23:45,880
yeah pretty much is like I'm doing the

500
00:23:45,880 --> 00:23:48,280
best I can as a one-man band but it's a

501
00:23:48,280 --> 00:23:50,200
case of I'm just treating everyone like

502
00:23:50,200 --> 00:23:52,480
humans and just creating that positive

503
00:23:52,480 --> 00:23:53,710
culture by saying look I need to achieve

504
00:23:53,710 --> 00:23:55,929
this goal let's work together and get it

505
00:23:55,929 --> 00:23:57,760
done you know I'll take on a lot of the

506
00:23:57,760 --> 00:23:59,350
work myself which could cause me to be a

507
00:23:59,350 --> 00:24:01,059
bottleneck but the devs are actually

508
00:24:01,059 --> 00:24:02,050
seeing the work I'm doing

509
00:24:02,050 --> 00:24:03,910
and they're actually reaching out to

510
00:24:03,910 --> 00:24:06,460
help so it's it's just that positive

511
00:24:06,460 --> 00:24:08,230
community that'sthat's what I find I've

512
00:24:08,230 --> 00:24:09,880
got the most traction from you know

513
00:24:09,880 --> 00:24:11,170
rather than going in and saying hey I've

514
00:24:11,170 --> 00:24:12,580
found a bunch of problems in your source

515
00:24:12,580 --> 00:24:14,470
code I'm going to stop development it's

516
00:24:14,470 --> 00:24:16,150
kind of like well let's carry on

517
00:24:16,150 --> 00:24:18,430
developing let's audit it and let's try

518
00:24:18,430 --> 00:24:21,870
and work on a way to make things better

519
00:24:21,990 --> 00:24:25,300
now pretty much niceness also niceness

520
00:24:25,300 --> 00:24:27,730
insecurity right I wish that that wasn't

521
00:24:27,730 --> 00:24:31,900
such a radical concept so for the last

522
00:24:31,900 --> 00:24:34,000
one I have some in my back pocket but

523
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:36,820
does anyone want number five to come

524
00:24:36,820 --> 00:24:40,450
from you you have a radical idea in dev

525
00:24:40,450 --> 00:24:47,100
stick ops for 2020 from the back

526
00:24:52,220 --> 00:24:54,409
I'm jeanna week everyone wake up wake up

527

00:25:04,570 --> 00:25:12,370

awake I'll be awake for these amazing

537
00:25:29,389 --> 00:25:35,509
speakers coming up so if if no one here

538
00:25:35,509 --> 00:25:37,250
wants to take the stage and put in

539
00:25:37,250 --> 00:25:40,340
number five my number five and the

540
00:25:40,340 --> 00:25:42,019
reason why I like being here at Def Con

541
00:25:42,019 --> 00:25:45,559
so much my the deficit ops community

542
00:25:45,559 --> 00:25:47,870
means so much to me is just like

543
00:25:47,870 --> 00:25:51,409
niceness in information security I have

544
00:25:51,409 --> 00:25:53,059
a good friends who posted on Twitter

545
00:25:53,059 --> 00:25:56,269
about the hacker conferences in Vegas

546
00:25:56,269 --> 00:26:00,440
that for new people they should go and

547
00:26:00,440 --> 00:26:02,659
they should be part of it and they

548
00:26:02,659 --> 00:26:04,909
should know that people are gonna Punk

549
00:26:04,909 --> 00:26:08,000
them and troll them and hack them and

550
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:10,789
steal their stuff and that's okay now

551
00:26:10,789 --> 00:26:13,940
you're part of the community and I just

552
00:26:13,940 --> 00:26:16,970
think that that's like not what I want

553
00:26:16,970 --> 00:26:19,309
to be part of the not you know where I

554
00:26:19,309 --> 00:26:21,649
want to be and I wish I weren't a

555
00:26:21,649 --> 00:26:23,929
radical idea but it is still kind of a

556
00:26:23,929 --> 00:26:27,320
radical idea the concept that we should

557
00:26:27,320 --> 00:26:29,450
do niceness and professionalism be nice

558
00:26:29,450 --> 00:26:32,149
and be professional in the security

559
00:26:32,149 --> 00:26:34,399
space and I think devstack ops is

560
00:26:34,399 --> 00:26:37,340
already really like on the front line of

561
00:26:37,340 --> 00:26:41,330
that but following up on some of these

562
00:26:41,330 --> 00:26:44,720
stories that just came out that's what I

563
00:26:44,720 --> 00:26:47,090
would want to leave you with that I'm

564
00:26:47,090 --> 00:26:48,590
grateful to be part of a community that

565
00:26:48,590 --> 00:26:50,899
cares about that and I think we should

566
00:26:50,899 --> 00:26:54,230
keep having that like really top of mind

567
00:26:54,230 --> 00:26:55,970
it's going to be what's going to help

568
00:26:55,970 --> 00:26:58,700
bring developers along

569
00:26:58,700 --> 00:27:01,669
and like listen to us and trust us and

570
00:27:01,669 --> 00:27:05,419
to not you know people aren't educated

571
00:27:05,419 --> 00:27:07,399
on security but it doesn't mean they're

572
00:27:07,399 --> 00:27:08,779
stupid and it doesn't mean that we

573
00:27:08,779 --> 00:27:12,830
should Punk them and I encourage you all

574
00:27:12,830 --> 00:27:15,200
to stay in touch I think we have a few

575
00:27:15,200 --> 00:27:16,369
more minutes we're a little behind

576
00:27:16,369 --> 00:27:18,799
schedule so I'm going to try and keep us

577
00:27:18,799 --> 00:27:19,700
on schedule

578
00:27:19,700 --> 00:27:22,009
does anyone have any questions before I

579
00:27:22,009 --> 00:27:24,679
jump off the stage you can save them for

580
00:27:24,679 --> 00:27:26,690
the ma a-- but you can do it here as

581
00:27:26,690 --> 00:27:32,239
well does anyone want to sing our

582
00:27:32,239 --> 00:27:33,259
birthday song

583
00:27:33,259 --> 00:27:38,389
to deaf second I actually had a question

584
00:27:38,389 --> 00:27:41,899
please what would you say is actually

585
00:27:41,899 --> 00:27:44,600
the hardest barrier to creating a

586
00:27:44,600 --> 00:27:46,669
culture shift within development teams

587
00:27:46,669 --> 00:27:51,200
of having a security focus because as

588
00:27:51,200 --> 00:27:53,080
the previous speaker was talking about

589
00:27:53,080 --> 00:27:55,639
having the security team coming and

590
00:27:55,639 --> 00:27:57,679
pointing out essentially flaws within

591
00:27:57,679 --> 00:28:00,259
their system isn't exactly looked upon

592
00:28:00,259 --> 00:28:04,519
right right it's so hard so I think

593
00:28:04,519 --> 00:28:07,190
there's two ways to do it one is if

594
00:28:07,190 --> 00:28:09,470
you're building a team from scratch you

595
00:28:09,470 --> 00:28:11,239
can hire people who are already kind of

596
00:28:11,239 --> 00:28:12,919
security people and that makes it easy

597
00:28:12,919 --> 00:28:16,129
when I was a brave everyone there was

598
00:28:16,129 --> 00:28:17,869
like a security and privacy person so

599
00:28:17,869 --> 00:28:19,759
that's like a cheat right if you're

600
00:28:19,759 --> 00:28:22,580
starting from scratch but if you already

601
00:28:22,580 --> 00:28:25,249
have a community I think you have to

602
00:28:25,249 --> 00:28:29,509
figure out how to integrate it into like

603
00:28:29,509 --> 00:28:31,730
the KPIs and to things that developers

604
00:28:31,730 --> 00:28:33,830
are accountable for and how to do the

605
00:28:33,830 --> 00:28:37,220
education in ways that are warm and

606
00:28:37,220 --> 00:28:40,460
friendly and are you know for people to

607
00:28:40,460 --> 00:28:43,609
level up and not for them to feel bad

608
00:28:43,609 --> 00:28:46,700
and that differs from organization to

609
00:28:46,700 --> 00:28:48,769
organization right you know the way you

610
00:28:48,769 --> 00:28:50,690
do training at a start-up is different

611
00:28:50,690 --> 00:28:52,609
from how you do training at an

612
00:28:52,609 --> 00:28:54,950
enterprise and so it ends up being very

613
00:28:54,950 --> 00:28:58,720
personal to the culture but ultimately

614
00:28:58,720 --> 00:29:02,269
it does have to be about respecting

615
00:29:02,269 --> 00:29:03,529
where developers are coming from

616
00:29:03,529 --> 00:29:05,720
respecting that they're in a rush to

617
00:29:05,720 --> 00:29:07,580
ship code they may not care about

618
00:29:07,580 --> 00:29:08,710
security

619
00:29:08,710 --> 00:29:10,420
you have to show them and walk them

620
00:29:10,420 --> 00:29:12,100
through what are the impacts the

621
00:29:12,100 --> 00:29:14,230
organization and what are the reasons

622
00:29:14,230 --> 00:29:15,970
why they have a responsibility now that

623
00:29:15,970 --> 00:29:17,920
they never had before right like how

624
00:29:17,920 --> 00:29:19,300
does it feel and you suddenly have a

625
00:29:19,300 --> 00:29:22,000
whole set of new tasks feels like hard

626
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:25,000
and kind of weird and like how come I

627
00:29:25,000 --> 00:29:27,280
didn't have to do this before does

628
00:29:27,280 --> 00:29:29,830
anyone have any any suggestions someone

629
00:29:29,830 --> 00:29:31,060
who's made this work in their

630
00:29:31,060 --> 00:29:34,780
organization basically I think this is

631
00:29:34,780 --> 00:29:36,730
like the hardest problem it's really

632
00:29:36,730 --> 00:29:40,870
hard to change culture and so we see

633
00:29:40,870 --> 00:29:42,640
this in diversity and inclusion we see

634
00:29:42,640 --> 00:29:45,040
this in every aspect of culture then you

635
00:29:45,040 --> 00:29:46,570
have culture it's so hard to change it

636
00:29:46,570 --> 00:29:48,670
and so it's the same thing to hear

637
00:29:48,670 --> 00:29:50,920
insecurity the easiest thing is to start

638
00:29:50,920 --> 00:29:53,230
from day one and if you can start from

639
00:29:53,230 --> 00:29:56,350
day one people tend to follow management

640
00:29:56,350 --> 00:29:59,350
and tend to follow like the leaders like

641
00:29:59,350 --> 00:30:01,360
the popular kids the cool kids in an

642
00:30:01,360 --> 00:30:03,310
organization and so you can leverage

643
00:30:03,310 --> 00:30:08,230
that to shift culture any other I'm here

644
00:30:08,230 --> 00:30:11,170
you can ask me anything people have lots

645
00:30:11,170 --> 00:30:12,550
of things they want to ask me but

646
00:30:12,550 --> 00:30:16,660
they're polite especially we're in

647
00:30:16,660 --> 00:30:21,420
London and we're very polite anyone else

648
00:30:21,420 --> 00:30:23,800
all right you'll save it for the 11:00

649
00:30:23,800 --> 00:30:24,130
o'clock

650
00:30:24,130 --> 00:30:28,480
ma I'm so thrilled to be here and on

651
00:30:28,480 --> 00:30:31,350
this anniversary wish me once again

652
00:30:31,350 --> 00:30:35,320
happy birthday DEFCON round of applause
