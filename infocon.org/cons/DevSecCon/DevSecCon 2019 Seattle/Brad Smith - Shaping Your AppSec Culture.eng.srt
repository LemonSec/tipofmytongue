00:00:00,480 --> 00:00:04,220
[Applause]

2
00:00:04,490 --> 00:00:07,200
well good morning it's good to see some

3
00:00:07,200 --> 00:00:08,970
familiar faces I talked to some of you

4
00:00:08,970 --> 00:00:13,980
yesterday downstairs and good morning

5
00:00:13,980 --> 00:00:15,690
good afternoon you guys have your

6
00:00:15,690 --> 00:00:18,420
cookies your coffee so let's let's do

7
00:00:18,420 --> 00:00:20,310
this I want to tell you this tale of the

8
00:00:20,310 --> 00:00:24,090
developer who had a zero flaw deploy

9
00:00:24,090 --> 00:00:27,420
that is deployed an application with no

10
00:00:27,420 --> 00:00:29,580
known first party or third party code

11
00:00:29,580 --> 00:00:31,529
now think about the burden that's lifted

12
00:00:31,529 --> 00:00:34,440
off when you don't have a backlog of

13
00:00:34,440 --> 00:00:38,340
known issues out in production and today

14
00:00:38,340 --> 00:00:39,899
we're going to talk about how can we

15
00:00:39,899 --> 00:00:42,059
create that type of momentum in our

16
00:00:42,059 --> 00:00:43,219
organizations

17
00:00:43,219 --> 00:00:46,829
so I've titled this shaping the app SEC

18
00:00:46,829 --> 00:00:49,410
culture shaping your OPSEC culture and I

19
00:00:49,410 --> 00:00:51,780
use that word intentionally shaping it

20
00:00:51,780 --> 00:00:55,160
means you know moulding to influence I

21
00:00:55,160 --> 00:00:57,870
could have used the word change in your

22
00:00:57,870 --> 00:01:00,359
culture but cultures aren't static

23
00:01:00,359 --> 00:01:01,920
they're always they're always changing

24
00:01:01,920 --> 00:01:04,830
by default I could have said building

25
00:01:04,830 --> 00:01:07,110
the culture but I don't know how to

26
00:01:07,110 --> 00:01:11,490
build a culture and creating a culture I

27
00:01:11,490 --> 00:01:12,900
know I I don't think that's something

28
00:01:12,900 --> 00:01:14,790
one person can do so I want to give you

29
00:01:14,790 --> 00:01:18,030
some ideas into your head that you can

30
00:01:18,030 --> 00:01:22,049
take back to maybe influence the

31
00:01:22,049 --> 00:01:24,180
discussion of application security at

32
00:01:24,180 --> 00:01:27,689
your organization's so I got an email a

33
00:01:27,689 --> 00:01:29,610
few weeks ago from an Operations lead

34
00:01:29,610 --> 00:01:32,549
and the company think of this person is

35
00:01:32,549 --> 00:01:35,340
like a JIRA administrator or gitlab

36
00:01:35,340 --> 00:01:38,159
administrator and he said the rollout of

37
00:01:38,159 --> 00:01:41,820
the app sect tool in our CIC CDs stages

38
00:01:41,820 --> 00:01:44,189
is going well so right there that tells

39
00:01:44,189 --> 00:01:48,210
me this organization has some momentum

40
00:01:48,210 --> 00:01:50,040
they've got a rollout plan they've

41
00:01:50,040 --> 00:01:52,229
they've rolled this out in some teams

42
00:01:52,229 --> 00:01:54,390
they're working on it on the current

43
00:01:54,390 --> 00:01:55,770
team and they've got a plan to move

44
00:01:55,770 --> 00:01:58,530
forward this week we also had our first

45
00:01:58,530 --> 00:02:00,750
instance of the tool acting as a gate

46
00:02:00,750 --> 00:02:03,960
for dev deployment so that also tells me

47
00:02:03,960 --> 00:02:06,509
this organization has a man executive

48
00:02:06,509 --> 00:02:08,310
mandate they have the ability to put a

49
00:02:08,310 --> 00:02:10,550
gate on whatever pipeline this is

50
00:02:10,550 --> 00:02:13,379
someone in the company is saying yes we

51
00:02:13,379 --> 00:02:13,830
will

52
00:02:13,830 --> 00:02:15,720
stop this from going to production if

53
00:02:15,720 --> 00:02:17,820
there's you know a vulnerability that

54
00:02:17,820 --> 00:02:19,830
meets our policy and the the scan

55
00:02:19,830 --> 00:02:23,880
detected an instance of cwe 611 a recent

56
00:02:23,880 --> 00:02:26,610
addition to the OWASP top 10 I believe

57
00:02:26,610 --> 00:02:29,910
and this is awesome coming from someone

58
00:02:29,910 --> 00:02:31,590
who's not on the security team not a

59
00:02:31,590 --> 00:02:33,750
developer the operations team is using

60
00:02:33,750 --> 00:02:37,620
the cwe flaw categories to refer to a

61
00:02:37,620 --> 00:02:40,740
vulnerability that was stopped in this

62
00:02:40,740 --> 00:02:43,950
automatic you know SDLC integration with

63
00:02:43,950 --> 00:02:45,600
their security to him the gate triggered

64
00:02:45,600 --> 00:02:48,630
the right discussions with InfoSec which

65
00:02:48,630 --> 00:02:53,450
was pleasing so right there you have it

66
00:02:53,450 --> 00:02:55,650
developer introduced of vulnerability

67
00:02:55,650 --> 00:03:00,930
cwe 611 into their application and what

68
00:03:00,930 --> 00:03:03,600
happened well you know security didn't

69
00:03:03,600 --> 00:03:05,190
come down and just hammer on that

70
00:03:05,190 --> 00:03:07,080
developer the developer didn't get fired

71
00:03:07,080 --> 00:03:10,920
they just had a discussion with the

72
00:03:10,920 --> 00:03:13,140
development team the operations team and

73
00:03:13,140 --> 00:03:15,060
the security team now if that sounds

74
00:03:15,060 --> 00:03:16,560
like a mouthful we could just call it

75
00:03:16,560 --> 00:03:19,830
dev ii ops all working together to have

76
00:03:19,830 --> 00:03:23,370
that continuous feedback loop where you

77
00:03:23,370 --> 00:03:25,260
know that developer is now learning what

78
00:03:25,260 --> 00:03:27,510
that flaw is and by the way if you don't

79
00:03:27,510 --> 00:03:32,550
know a cwe 6:11 is that's x XE xml

80
00:03:32,550 --> 00:03:35,580
external entity injection and we're

81
00:03:35,580 --> 00:03:37,530
going to be talking about this more but

82
00:03:37,530 --> 00:03:39,810
I think that's something you know my

83
00:03:39,810 --> 00:03:41,220
goal on this talk is you walk away if

84
00:03:41,220 --> 00:03:44,400
you don't know what X XE is you're gonna

85
00:03:44,400 --> 00:03:45,120
know about it

86
00:03:45,120 --> 00:03:46,680
you're gonna be able to talk about it

87
00:03:46,680 --> 00:03:48,120
with other people on your team and

88
00:03:48,120 --> 00:03:51,360
really if you've worked with XML or

89
00:03:51,360 --> 00:03:54,030
you're working with anyone who does work

90
00:03:54,030 --> 00:03:56,670
with XML and this is something that we

91
00:03:56,670 --> 00:04:00,630
want to be talking about so not every

92
00:04:00,630 --> 00:04:03,150
company's at that stage yet and I kind

93
00:04:03,150 --> 00:04:05,880
of see three mindsets that organizations

94
00:04:05,880 --> 00:04:07,620
typically have when it comes to

95
00:04:07,620 --> 00:04:09,720
application security and the first is

96
00:04:09,720 --> 00:04:14,880
the reactive mode this is where you know

97
00:04:14,880 --> 00:04:17,160
we're doing some type of application

98
00:04:17,160 --> 00:04:19,350
security but the codes already in

99
00:04:19,350 --> 00:04:22,340
production so we might have a backlog of

100
00:04:22,340 --> 00:04:25,080
as I've seen before a hundred thousand

101
00:04:25,080 --> 00:04:27,280
vulnerabilities that we

102
00:04:27,280 --> 00:04:29,920
they're in production but we don't have

103
00:04:29,920 --> 00:04:31,480
anyone working on them because there's

104
00:04:31,480 --> 00:04:33,730
competing priorities or there's no

105
00:04:33,730 --> 00:04:36,160
developers and these are companies that

106
00:04:36,160 --> 00:04:38,650
typically are doing some manual pen

107
00:04:38,650 --> 00:04:40,090
testing maybe there's a two-week period

108
00:04:40,090 --> 00:04:42,250
at the end of development where a

109
00:04:42,250 --> 00:04:45,190
cybersecurity team has some authority to

110
00:04:45,190 --> 00:04:48,940
do pen testing or you've got your you

111
00:04:48,940 --> 00:04:51,400
know your your bug bounty programs

112
00:04:51,400 --> 00:04:53,200
things that are already in production

113
00:04:53,200 --> 00:04:55,930
the proactive approach is where we're

114
00:04:55,930 --> 00:04:58,180
trying to get integrated into the SDLC

115
00:04:58,180 --> 00:05:00,490
shifting left as you say so you might

116
00:05:00,490 --> 00:05:03,520
have different stages threat modeling

117
00:05:03,520 --> 00:05:06,520
over here then while the developer's

118
00:05:06,520 --> 00:05:08,140
coding than their IDE they're maybe

119
00:05:08,140 --> 00:05:10,510
getting security notices if they're

120
00:05:10,510 --> 00:05:12,490
using insecure functions and their IDE

121
00:05:12,490 --> 00:05:15,850
then when they commit it to their code

122
00:05:15,850 --> 00:05:17,950
repository they're doing a post build a

123
00:05:17,950 --> 00:05:22,810
post commit step to analyze that code

124
00:05:22,810 --> 00:05:24,700
look at their first party third party

125
00:05:24,700 --> 00:05:27,280
code then you have a you know Jenkins or

126
00:05:27,280 --> 00:05:29,320
a CI server that's maybe uploading it to

127
00:05:29,320 --> 00:05:31,169
a sandbox test area

128
00:05:31,169 --> 00:05:33,340
analyzing all the code from all the

129
00:05:33,340 --> 00:05:35,530
developers integrated and then by the

130
00:05:35,530 --> 00:05:37,419
time you're going to production you've

131
00:05:37,419 --> 00:05:39,750
already got a clean policy scan there

132
00:05:39,750 --> 00:05:42,310
for whatever tools you're doing so

133
00:05:42,310 --> 00:05:43,720
that's more of a proactive approach

134
00:05:43,720 --> 00:05:45,790
where you're trying to fix the flaws

135
00:05:45,790 --> 00:05:50,530
when it's cheaper and then the exposed

136
00:05:50,530 --> 00:05:53,590
mindset that's really when you know

137
00:05:53,590 --> 00:05:56,040
there's been a breach your companies on

138
00:05:56,040 --> 00:05:59,110
you know Brian Krebs or there's a PR

139
00:05:59,110 --> 00:06:02,620
there's a legal approach and now you're

140
00:06:02,620 --> 00:06:04,270
still putting all the work in but you're

141
00:06:04,270 --> 00:06:08,110
doing it in a reactive way there and so

142
00:06:08,110 --> 00:06:10,660
in all three cases it comes down to

143
00:06:10,660 --> 00:06:12,700
building trust either you're restoring

144
00:06:12,700 --> 00:06:16,750
trust you're building trust or and the

145
00:06:16,750 --> 00:06:19,240
reactive approach you know you I could

146
00:06:19,240 --> 00:06:22,810
argue you're just kind of you've got

147
00:06:22,810 --> 00:06:24,970
that that capital there that trusted but

148
00:06:24,970 --> 00:06:26,020
you don't know when it's going to run

149
00:06:26,020 --> 00:06:31,930
out so 20 years ago there was a story

150
00:06:31,930 --> 00:06:34,450
and a well-known political magazine

151
00:06:34,450 --> 00:06:37,960
about a 15 year old hacker who had

152
00:06:37,960 --> 00:06:40,030
broken into a Palo Alto company called

153
00:06:40,030 --> 00:06:41,350
jukt micronics

154
00:06:41,350 --> 00:06:45,070
changed their webpage and then hired an

155
00:06:45,070 --> 00:06:47,200
agent to represent him to the company

156
00:06:47,200 --> 00:06:49,720
that they so he could go in and fix it

157
00:06:49,720 --> 00:06:53,110
when they couldn't fix it has anyone

158
00:06:53,110 --> 00:06:56,620
heard of the story hack heaven so this

159
00:06:56,620 --> 00:07:00,460
is mean I have it anyway look let me

160
00:07:00,460 --> 00:07:01,300
tell you more about it

161
00:07:01,300 --> 00:07:05,920
this guy fifteen year old said I'll fix

162
00:07:05,920 --> 00:07:08,170
the vulnerability but I wanted Miata I

163
00:07:08,170 --> 00:07:10,360
wanted to pass the Disneyworld and just

164
00:07:10,360 --> 00:07:11,770
show me the money and the company was

165
00:07:11,770 --> 00:07:14,500
like yeah we'll do it turns out the

166
00:07:14,500 --> 00:07:16,750
whole story was fabricated the writer

167
00:07:16,750 --> 00:07:19,090
made the whole thing up and this was in

168
00:07:19,090 --> 00:07:21,940
the magazine that was on Air Force One

169
00:07:21,940 --> 00:07:25,060
well-known and there's a good movie that

170
00:07:25,060 --> 00:07:28,330
was filmed about it that I believe

171
00:07:28,330 --> 00:07:30,150
should be on you know the top

172
00:07:30,150 --> 00:07:31,990
cybersecurity films it's called

173
00:07:31,990 --> 00:07:33,910
shattered glass so I'd recommend

174
00:07:33,910 --> 00:07:36,610
checking that out if you want to there's

175
00:07:36,610 --> 00:07:38,740
more journalism in it but it's it's an

176
00:07:38,740 --> 00:07:41,050
interesting story to see 20 years ago

177
00:07:41,050 --> 00:07:45,070
there's this idea of hackers breaking

178
00:07:45,070 --> 00:07:47,320
into companies and then then scrambling

179
00:07:47,320 --> 00:07:50,290
to fix the vulnerabilities and we see

180
00:07:50,290 --> 00:07:51,910
today something that was fictitious 20

181
00:07:51,910 --> 00:07:54,160
years ago you know that's the place a

182
00:07:54,160 --> 00:07:55,810
lot of companies are in there just

183
00:07:55,810 --> 00:07:59,800
waiting to see what comes in right and

184
00:07:59,800 --> 00:08:02,170
kind of responding to it so we want to

185
00:08:02,170 --> 00:08:05,680
reduce the risk by remediating software

186
00:08:05,680 --> 00:08:07,750
flaws earlier on and how can we in this

187
00:08:07,750 --> 00:08:10,450
room kind of get some momentum in our

188
00:08:10,450 --> 00:08:12,550
organizations for that so companies are

189
00:08:12,550 --> 00:08:14,400
trying to get in front of the problem I

190
00:08:14,400 --> 00:08:20,230
just pulled up the most recent survey in

191
00:08:20,230 --> 00:08:22,450
the top 10 highest paying cybersecurity

192
00:08:22,450 --> 00:08:25,230
jobs in the top five three of them are

193
00:08:25,230 --> 00:08:28,060
applications security related so if

194
00:08:28,060 --> 00:08:31,480
you're a developer and you just start

195
00:08:31,480 --> 00:08:33,610
talking about security with people in

196
00:08:33,610 --> 00:08:34,990
your company even if you don't have an

197
00:08:34,990 --> 00:08:37,059
official security role you're gonna

198
00:08:37,059 --> 00:08:39,099
start filling that need there's

199
00:08:39,099 --> 00:08:41,289
vacancies there there's not enough

200
00:08:41,289 --> 00:08:43,270
people to fill these jobs and companies

201
00:08:43,270 --> 00:08:46,060
you know they're expensive jobs to fill

202
00:08:46,060 --> 00:08:48,820
and so there's a need for people who are

203
00:08:48,820 --> 00:08:51,910
already working on tools developers to

204
00:08:51,910 --> 00:08:54,420
be having these applications to

205
00:08:54,420 --> 00:08:57,180
conversations talking about xxe when

206
00:08:57,180 --> 00:09:00,180
you're doing xml work and parsers and

207
00:09:00,180 --> 00:09:03,810
things like that and there's a little

208
00:09:03,810 --> 00:09:07,500
bit goes a long way just by you know

209
00:09:07,500 --> 00:09:09,720
becoming that you don't even need to be

210
00:09:09,720 --> 00:09:12,510
that official security champion but just

211
00:09:12,510 --> 00:09:15,269
have having those conversations is going

212
00:09:15,269 --> 00:09:19,560
to show that expertise and help put you

213
00:09:19,560 --> 00:09:22,290
in a position to shape the culture even

214
00:09:22,290 --> 00:09:23,970
if you don't have an official mandator

215
00:09:23,970 --> 00:09:28,320
or title or role you can make a big

216
00:09:28,320 --> 00:09:32,519
difference so when i look at companies

217
00:09:32,519 --> 00:09:35,160
and my role is a program manager i go in

218
00:09:35,160 --> 00:09:38,070
and consulting role and help companies

219
00:09:38,070 --> 00:09:40,610
set up applications security programs i

220
00:09:40,610 --> 00:09:42,660
can kind of put them into four buckets

221
00:09:42,660 --> 00:09:44,610
in terms of maturity and we talked about

222
00:09:44,610 --> 00:09:46,350
the reactive approach that's where

223
00:09:46,350 --> 00:09:47,699
you're doing that kind of ad hoc

224
00:09:47,699 --> 00:09:53,190
application security and so typically

225
00:09:53,190 --> 00:09:55,949
manual penetration testing you're just

226
00:09:55,949 --> 00:09:57,839
looking at your critical applications

227
00:09:57,839 --> 00:10:01,350
you don't have a lot of time and it's

228
00:10:01,350 --> 00:10:03,300
it's very manual it doesn't scale the

229
00:10:03,300 --> 00:10:05,130
baseline approach is when companies

230
00:10:05,130 --> 00:10:07,380
start realizing we don't know what our

231
00:10:07,380 --> 00:10:09,480
risk is we don't know what the threat

232
00:10:09,480 --> 00:10:12,089
landscape of of our applications are

233
00:10:12,089 --> 00:10:14,250
what our parameters whether inventory is

234
00:10:14,250 --> 00:10:16,500
we just want to start baseline in

235
00:10:16,500 --> 00:10:18,000
everything to see what we have

236
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:20,579
that typically starts with your business

237
00:10:20,579 --> 00:10:22,589
critical apps you know you might look at

238
00:10:22,589 --> 00:10:25,170
your your disaster recovery list of what

239
00:10:25,170 --> 00:10:27,300
order do we bring our apps back online

240
00:10:27,300 --> 00:10:29,760
if there's a disaster and just start

241
00:10:29,760 --> 00:10:32,850
going through do we have a clear view of

242
00:10:32,850 --> 00:10:34,589
the applications vulnerabilities in

243
00:10:34,589 --> 00:10:37,319
those applications and that might

244
00:10:37,319 --> 00:10:39,750
include more testing you might be

245
00:10:39,750 --> 00:10:41,399
looking at your first party code as well

246
00:10:41,399 --> 00:10:48,000
as your third party code the expanded

247
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:50,100
approach that's really when you start

248
00:10:50,100 --> 00:10:51,510
getting the moment and you see the

249
00:10:51,510 --> 00:10:54,089
culture changing and perhaps this starts

250
00:10:54,089 --> 00:10:56,279
with looking at your inventory of your

251
00:10:56,279 --> 00:10:58,709
applications and then putting a plan in

252
00:10:58,709 --> 00:11:01,260
place if you have 1,200 applications or

253
00:11:01,260 --> 00:11:05,160
if you have 150 micro services or you

254
00:11:05,160 --> 00:11:06,899
know whatever how are we going to get

255
00:11:06,899 --> 00:11:07,860
out that in an

256
00:11:07,860 --> 00:11:09,959
automated way that's gonna scale where

257
00:11:09,959 --> 00:11:11,910
we don't have to hire more people and

258
00:11:11,910 --> 00:11:16,019
where we don't have to you know spin up

259
00:11:16,019 --> 00:11:19,200
a large infrastructure but where how can

260
00:11:19,200 --> 00:11:22,410
we bring you know solutions and tools to

261
00:11:22,410 --> 00:11:24,839
the problems that to bear that the

262
00:11:24,839 --> 00:11:27,300
developers can use to make sure they're

263
00:11:27,300 --> 00:11:29,339
writing secure code so that's the

264
00:11:29,339 --> 00:11:30,990
expanded approach we're starting to get

265
00:11:30,990 --> 00:11:32,940
a three five year plan going and the

266
00:11:32,940 --> 00:11:35,700
advanced approaches really we've got a

267
00:11:35,700 --> 00:11:37,680
track record of application security

268
00:11:37,680 --> 00:11:39,959
things are going well we've got

269
00:11:39,959 --> 00:11:42,180
framework we've got governance we've got

270
00:11:42,180 --> 00:11:46,769
funding and and I'm going from there so

271
00:11:46,769 --> 00:11:49,740
general general buckets but it's helpful

272
00:11:49,740 --> 00:11:50,970
because if you know where your

273
00:11:50,970 --> 00:11:53,519
organization falls then you can start

274
00:11:53,519 --> 00:11:57,170
thinking how do I get to the next level

275
00:11:57,890 --> 00:12:01,440
so an analogy in the equestrian analogy

276
00:12:01,440 --> 00:12:03,570
here here we are city slickers in

277
00:12:03,570 --> 00:12:05,640
Seattle in the rain

278
00:12:05,640 --> 00:12:09,690
but a lot of times I go and talk to a

279
00:12:09,690 --> 00:12:13,589
company and they have applications you

280
00:12:13,589 --> 00:12:15,360
know all over the place they've got

281
00:12:15,360 --> 00:12:18,079
legacy applications they've got

282
00:12:18,079 --> 00:12:20,970
next-generation development application

283
00:12:20,970 --> 00:12:24,300
cloud applications you name it and a lot

284
00:12:24,300 --> 00:12:26,550
of the times I look at that and it

285
00:12:26,550 --> 00:12:29,160
reminds me of the Kentucky Derby game at

286
00:12:29,160 --> 00:12:32,040
the local fair and that's the game with

287
00:12:32,040 --> 00:12:34,440
all the horses lined up and usually you

288
00:12:34,440 --> 00:12:36,060
have a little like ball that you you

289
00:12:36,060 --> 00:12:38,310
roll and if it gets in a hole your your

290
00:12:38,310 --> 00:12:40,470
horse goes I had three clicks and you're

291
00:12:40,470 --> 00:12:42,060
trying to get to the end we've all seen

292
00:12:42,060 --> 00:12:44,880
that game and teams will say we've got

293
00:12:44,880 --> 00:12:47,459
so many applications we've got hundreds

294
00:12:47,459 --> 00:12:48,899
of different pipelines they're all

295
00:12:48,899 --> 00:12:50,970
following and they'll give push back

296
00:12:50,970 --> 00:12:53,000
they'll say my application is different

297
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:56,670
it's not going to AB SEC team you know

298
00:12:56,670 --> 00:12:58,290
don't bother it's not going to fit in

299
00:12:58,290 --> 00:13:01,680
there or there's too many pipelines so

300
00:13:01,680 --> 00:13:05,070
in analogy let's think about horses if

301
00:13:05,070 --> 00:13:08,250
you're an equestrian person and you

302
00:13:08,250 --> 00:13:09,570
think about the different breeds of

303
00:13:09,570 --> 00:13:14,190
horses you've got big Clydesdales you've

304
00:13:14,190 --> 00:13:17,730
got you know Shetland ponies in Scotland

305
00:13:17,730 --> 00:13:19,620
you've got thoroughbred racing horses

306
00:13:19,620 --> 00:13:21,410
there's a

307
00:13:21,410 --> 00:13:23,629
team that has a string of polo ponies

308
00:13:23,629 --> 00:13:25,429
playing in the US Open you've got a

309
00:13:25,429 --> 00:13:28,369
donkey and you've got a mule right those

310
00:13:28,369 --> 00:13:31,579
are all representative of the different

311
00:13:31,579 --> 00:13:33,949
applications in our organization and

312
00:13:33,949 --> 00:13:35,239
then you've got the horse that's out the

313
00:13:35,239 --> 00:13:38,029
pasture may be blind in one eye and we

314
00:13:38,029 --> 00:13:39,529
all can think of that application in our

315
00:13:39,529 --> 00:13:42,559
organization that fits like that that no

316
00:13:42,559 --> 00:13:45,079
one wants to touch no one has touched it

317
00:13:45,079 --> 00:13:48,319
but it's generating some revenue so it's

318
00:13:48,319 --> 00:13:50,569
it's it's still running over there now

319
00:13:50,569 --> 00:13:52,569
what do all these horses have in common

320
00:13:52,569 --> 00:13:54,889
well you know they've got different

321
00:13:54,889 --> 00:13:57,039
riders different writing styles

322
00:13:57,039 --> 00:14:00,049
different tack bridles bits that they're

323
00:14:00,049 --> 00:14:02,599
all wearing but they all have horseshoes

324
00:14:02,599 --> 00:14:06,199
on and in Tania's presentation yesterday

325
00:14:06,199 --> 00:14:08,869
she showed that slide of the rainbow

326
00:14:08,869 --> 00:14:10,429
unicorn and one of the pictures was

327
00:14:10,429 --> 00:14:15,319
security putting on the shoes of the on

328
00:14:15,319 --> 00:14:18,109
the unicorn I guess unicorns wear those

329
00:14:18,109 --> 00:14:20,239
and so that's that's this guy on the on

330
00:14:20,239 --> 00:14:22,639
the slide here this is the farrier he's

331
00:14:22,639 --> 00:14:26,109
in someone who specialized in equine

332
00:14:26,109 --> 00:14:29,600
hoof welfare so he's putting horse shoes

333
00:14:29,600 --> 00:14:32,179
on the horse he's he's shot in the hoods

334
00:14:32,179 --> 00:14:34,609
of those horses and that's what you know

335
00:14:34,609 --> 00:14:37,699
this analogy the security team is going

336
00:14:37,699 --> 00:14:39,470
to all the applications and all the

337
00:14:39,470 --> 00:14:40,939
different pipelines with all the

338
00:14:40,939 --> 00:14:43,569
different languages maturity levels and

339
00:14:43,569 --> 00:14:46,669
you're providing that security piece

340
00:14:46,669 --> 00:14:48,799
every five to seven weeks I guess they

341
00:14:48,799 --> 00:14:51,799
have to have to put that on so I've had

342
00:14:51,799 --> 00:14:54,470
teams that have given push back for all

343
00:14:54,470 --> 00:14:57,649
sorts of reasons they've said oh we're

344
00:14:57,649 --> 00:14:59,179
developing an application that gets

345
00:14:59,179 --> 00:15:01,970
deployed on a cd-rom and we mail it out

346
00:15:01,970 --> 00:15:04,009
to our customers so we don't need to fix

347
00:15:04,009 --> 00:15:07,009
these application vulnerabilities that

348
00:15:07,009 --> 00:15:10,970
were found and you start talking to me

349
00:15:10,970 --> 00:15:12,350
or I was like alright so it's getting

350
00:15:12,350 --> 00:15:13,789
shipped out and where's it getting

351
00:15:13,789 --> 00:15:15,229
installed oh it's getting installed in

352
00:15:15,229 --> 00:15:17,209
the bank and what happens if that Bank

353
00:15:17,209 --> 00:15:19,939
was breached and your application

354
00:15:19,939 --> 00:15:22,429
becomes part of the the breach chain

355
00:15:22,429 --> 00:15:23,809
there and you know about these

356
00:15:23,809 --> 00:15:25,519
vulnerabilities is that a position you

357
00:15:25,519 --> 00:15:27,229
want to be in and you start having those

358
00:15:27,229 --> 00:15:30,049
discussions and the the developers

359
00:15:30,049 --> 00:15:32,299
realize all right there is a risk here

360
00:15:32,299 --> 00:15:34,850
we do want to have secure code

361
00:15:34,850 --> 00:15:41,389
we do want to fix it so how do you how

362
00:15:41,389 --> 00:15:43,329
do you measure that how do you show

363
00:15:43,329 --> 00:15:47,629
progress from that you can look at the

364
00:15:47,629 --> 00:15:50,029
percentage of applications on-boarded so

365
00:15:50,029 --> 00:15:52,879
if you're looking across your company

366
00:15:52,879 --> 00:15:54,529
how many applications there are how many

367
00:15:54,529 --> 00:15:55,910
of those are going through some type of

368
00:15:55,910 --> 00:15:58,009
application security program if you're

369
00:15:58,009 --> 00:15:59,509
just thinking about your team perhaps

370
00:15:59,509 --> 00:16:02,089
there's a handful of applications but

371
00:16:02,089 --> 00:16:03,619
what we do is we look at flaw

372
00:16:03,619 --> 00:16:04,220
burned-down

373
00:16:04,220 --> 00:16:07,609
so we want to show remediation and a

374
00:16:07,609 --> 00:16:09,859
good metric there is flaw aging how many

375
00:16:09,859 --> 00:16:11,329
days does it take from the time of

376
00:16:11,329 --> 00:16:13,249
vulnerabilities found to the time that

377
00:16:13,249 --> 00:16:17,299
it's fixed by a team we also look at

378
00:16:17,299 --> 00:16:19,699
scan aging so how often are these

379
00:16:19,699 --> 00:16:23,869
applications being scanned and what are

380
00:16:23,869 --> 00:16:25,459
the different analysis types if you're

381
00:16:25,459 --> 00:16:27,679
doing static testing dynamic testing

382
00:16:27,679 --> 00:16:29,660
software composition analysis manual

383
00:16:29,660 --> 00:16:33,350
penetration testing you know how

384
00:16:33,350 --> 00:16:35,539
frequently are those happening and then

385
00:16:35,539 --> 00:16:37,579
what is the paper policy at the company

386
00:16:37,579 --> 00:16:40,819
that states what the requirements are so

387
00:16:40,819 --> 00:16:42,709
with those three things you can you can

388
00:16:42,709 --> 00:16:44,779
look at say you have 12 different teams

389
00:16:44,779 --> 00:16:48,470
you could look at the ones that you know

390
00:16:48,470 --> 00:16:49,220
which ones

391
00:16:49,220 --> 00:16:52,429
this team has scanned 50% of their apps

392
00:16:52,429 --> 00:16:55,159
and the average data fix a high severity

393
00:16:55,159 --> 00:16:58,279
vulnerability is 12 days and this team

394
00:16:58,279 --> 00:17:01,850
over here you know whatever and you can

395
00:17:01,850 --> 00:17:03,829
quickly see where the pockets of

396
00:17:03,829 --> 00:17:06,138
resistance are in the company when it

397
00:17:06,138 --> 00:17:07,970
comes to applications security

398
00:17:07,970 --> 00:17:10,539
development and those give you

399
00:17:10,539 --> 00:17:12,888
forward-looking actionable metrics that

400
00:17:12,888 --> 00:17:15,589
you can then use to engage the teams

401
00:17:15,589 --> 00:17:18,529
that have the highest risk that have are

402
00:17:18,529 --> 00:17:20,089
their most stuck and you can start to

403
00:17:20,089 --> 00:17:22,519
see what the competing priorities are

404
00:17:22,519 --> 00:17:24,138
that are preventing those up those

405
00:17:24,138 --> 00:17:27,220
vulnerabilities from getting fixed and

406
00:17:27,220 --> 00:17:29,299
you know why aren't the developers

407
00:17:29,299 --> 00:17:32,629
fixing them maybe you need you know so

408
00:17:32,629 --> 00:17:34,429
I've seen companies where they're

409
00:17:34,429 --> 00:17:36,200
they're trying to move from reactive to

410
00:17:36,200 --> 00:17:39,500
proactive they've hired extra developers

411
00:17:39,500 --> 00:17:41,299
just from remediation work to get them

412
00:17:41,299 --> 00:17:45,860
back - out of that backlog and I mean

413
00:17:45,860 --> 00:17:47,690
this is just an example of

414
00:17:47,690 --> 00:17:50,090
a dashboard where you could show every

415
00:17:50,090 --> 00:17:53,030
business unit flaw aging by severity the

416
00:17:53,030 --> 00:17:55,430
percentage of flaws that are within the

417
00:17:55,430 --> 00:17:59,390
company SLA and policy and you could

418
00:17:59,390 --> 00:18:01,790
start looking for ways to get the most

419
00:18:01,790 --> 00:18:04,370
value out of the least amount of work

420
00:18:04,370 --> 00:18:06,200
essentially by targeting those apps

421
00:18:06,200 --> 00:18:07,760
where they've got a lot of

422
00:18:07,760 --> 00:18:11,750
vulnerabilities on the breaches so I

423
00:18:11,750 --> 00:18:14,570
thought I could you know kind of rehash

424
00:18:14,570 --> 00:18:17,200
some of the recent breaches in the news

425
00:18:17,200 --> 00:18:19,210
trying to drive a sense of urgency

426
00:18:19,210 --> 00:18:22,640
application secured is important but we

427
00:18:22,640 --> 00:18:24,110
all know what those are some of us have

428
00:18:24,110 --> 00:18:26,570
gone through those so I thought I would

429
00:18:26,570 --> 00:18:28,610
take a different angle to try to show

430
00:18:28,610 --> 00:18:32,390
the timelessness of breaches so I want

431
00:18:32,390 --> 00:18:34,790
to go back 2000 years ago if you

432
00:18:34,790 --> 00:18:36,650
remember back in your history class or

433
00:18:36,650 --> 00:18:41,290
your English class the this first one is

434
00:18:41,290 --> 00:18:45,020
a story of a breach of the city of

435
00:18:45,020 --> 00:18:47,270
Alexandria and I'm gonna just read the

436
00:18:47,270 --> 00:18:49,280
paragraph from David Duncan's book

437
00:18:49,280 --> 00:18:52,790
calendar it says as night fell a small

438
00:18:52,790 --> 00:18:54,800
ship slipped under the sea chain

439
00:18:54,800 --> 00:18:57,410
defending alexandria's harbor it was

440
00:18:57,410 --> 00:18:59,330
raised by the guard who bribed the let

441
00:18:59,330 --> 00:19:01,970
pass in the boat on this balmy October

442
00:19:01,970 --> 00:19:04,640
evening in 48 BC stoled quietly through

443
00:19:04,640 --> 00:19:07,130
the black waters pathways and warehouses

444
00:19:07,130 --> 00:19:08,920
full of grain and pleasure treasure

445
00:19:08,920 --> 00:19:11,330
skirting the fleet's of Egyptian and

446
00:19:11,330 --> 00:19:13,700
Roman warships the boat carried a cargo

447
00:19:13,700 --> 00:19:15,290
that would not only transform two great

448
00:19:15,290 --> 00:19:17,660
empires but lead to a revolution in

449
00:19:17,660 --> 00:19:19,610
measuring time that's directly

450
00:19:19,610 --> 00:19:22,190
responsible for our calendar today after

451
00:19:22,190 --> 00:19:24,140
the boat landed unnoticed on the stone

452
00:19:24,140 --> 00:19:26,720
Wharf a Sicilian named Apollodorus slept

453
00:19:26,720 --> 00:19:28,880
ashore carefully lifting onto his back a

454
00:19:28,880 --> 00:19:32,120
rolled-up coverlet basically a bed linen

455
00:19:32,120 --> 00:19:34,790
or carpet that was tied at each and an

456
00:19:34,790 --> 00:19:37,670
Apollodorus carried his load past the

457
00:19:37,670 --> 00:19:39,800
Roman sentinels explaining by the light

458
00:19:39,800 --> 00:19:41,930
of torches that he bore gift for the

459
00:19:41,930 --> 00:19:44,360
recently arrived Julius Caesar dictator

460
00:19:44,360 --> 00:19:46,970
of Rome led to the generals apartment in

461
00:19:46,970 --> 00:19:49,010
Alexandria as royal palace Apollodorus

462
00:19:49,010 --> 00:19:50,930
greeted Caesar by unfurling in the

463
00:19:50,930 --> 00:19:53,090
carpet and out rolled a woman and this

464
00:19:53,090 --> 00:19:54,940
is if you remember from history

465
00:19:54,940 --> 00:19:58,250
Cleopatra infiltrating kind of the

466
00:19:58,250 --> 00:20:00,870
defenses of the city of Alexandria

467
00:20:00,870 --> 00:20:04,170
were held by her half-brother Ptolemy

468
00:20:04,170 --> 00:20:07,140
and and getting an audience with Julius

469
00:20:07,140 --> 00:20:09,090
Caesar and she was rolled up in the

470
00:20:09,090 --> 00:20:12,380
blanket so he had an external entity

471
00:20:12,380 --> 00:20:15,690
infiltrating the security measures not

472
00:20:15,690 --> 00:20:20,100
quite xxe but you know that same idea

473
00:20:20,100 --> 00:20:22,650
there and then going back to your

474
00:20:22,650 --> 00:20:25,350
English class you guys remember this the

475
00:20:25,350 --> 00:20:29,010
Trojan horse even that phrase Trojan

476
00:20:29,010 --> 00:20:31,140
Trojan horse has entered the cyber

477
00:20:31,140 --> 00:20:34,440
security lexicon as is something we see

478
00:20:34,440 --> 00:20:36,840
but how many of us have have kind of

479
00:20:36,840 --> 00:20:38,880
read that read the story of that and so

480
00:20:38,880 --> 00:20:41,179
this is from Virgil's Aeneid

481
00:20:41,179 --> 00:20:44,010
it's just a couple paragraphs says we

482
00:20:44,010 --> 00:20:45,809
cut the walls up and we open the city

483
00:20:45,809 --> 00:20:48,710
and we put rollers underneath the the

484
00:20:48,710 --> 00:20:51,179
horses feet and we tighten ropes around

485
00:20:51,179 --> 00:20:53,460
its neck and a great machine that climbs

486
00:20:53,460 --> 00:20:55,500
up to the fortress pregnant with arms

487
00:20:55,500 --> 00:20:58,170
full of soldiers young boys and girls

488
00:20:58,170 --> 00:21:00,540
around it sang hymns and touched the

489
00:21:00,540 --> 00:21:03,330
ropes in their joy as it loomed into the

490
00:21:03,330 --> 00:21:05,130
middle of a town the heroic walls of

491
00:21:05,130 --> 00:21:07,740
Troy the God's home my country four

492
00:21:07,740 --> 00:21:09,540
times in the gate itself it halted

493
00:21:09,540 --> 00:21:11,460
weapons clattered in its belly and we

494
00:21:11,460 --> 00:21:13,800
pushed on blind with passion distracted

495
00:21:13,800 --> 00:21:15,840
and it set the monster and our sacred

496
00:21:15,840 --> 00:21:16,850
stronghold

497
00:21:16,850 --> 00:21:19,350
Cassandra spoke then echoing the future

498
00:21:19,350 --> 00:21:21,929
but by the gods will Troy will never

499
00:21:21,929 --> 00:21:24,510
listen Greek ships signaled with flame

500
00:21:24,510 --> 00:21:26,190
men in the shelter of the horse slipped

501
00:21:26,190 --> 00:21:27,660
the pine bolts and birthed the Greeks

502
00:21:27,660 --> 00:21:29,910
and the horse gaped up into the sky from

503
00:21:29,910 --> 00:21:32,550
its wooden case the eager chieftain slid

504
00:21:32,550 --> 00:21:34,830
down the rope including Ulysses and they

505
00:21:34,830 --> 00:21:36,660
swarmed the city sunken wine asleep

506
00:21:36,660 --> 00:21:38,550
slaughter the guards open the gates and

507
00:21:38,550 --> 00:21:41,520
let their comrades and uniting ranks as

508
00:21:41,520 --> 00:21:45,960
planned and so don't be like those

509
00:21:45,960 --> 00:21:48,420
cities but we want to proactively shaped

510
00:21:48,420 --> 00:21:51,210
your app set culture rather than

511
00:21:51,210 --> 00:21:53,730
reactively rebuilding you know the brand

512
00:21:53,730 --> 00:21:55,590
reputation the trust after a breach

513
00:21:55,590 --> 00:22:01,470
happens so how do we do this you shape

514
00:22:01,470 --> 00:22:03,690
the culture by turning the ship slowly

515
00:22:03,690 --> 00:22:06,270
you know large ship turns slowly there's

516
00:22:06,270 --> 00:22:08,210
a lot of mass there

517
00:22:08,210 --> 00:22:10,580
identifying the goal getting that

518
00:22:10,580 --> 00:22:12,290
top-down support that bottom-up

519
00:22:12,290 --> 00:22:14,900
grassroots momentum and the process in

520
00:22:14,900 --> 00:22:18,620
place and you can take it from a lot of

521
00:22:18,620 --> 00:22:19,940
different angles I've talked about

522
00:22:19,940 --> 00:22:21,890
starting with your application inventory

523
00:22:21,890 --> 00:22:24,110
and just looking at what percentage of

524
00:22:24,110 --> 00:22:27,170
that has been tested for vulnerabilities

525
00:22:27,170 --> 00:22:29,480
and you'll find that you probably don't

526
00:22:29,480 --> 00:22:32,420
have a master application inventory so

527
00:22:32,420 --> 00:22:35,810
that's something that an application

528
00:22:35,810 --> 00:22:37,850
security program can a project that it

529
00:22:37,850 --> 00:22:42,230
could attach on to look at lead

530
00:22:42,230 --> 00:22:43,550
developers so if you have 500

531
00:22:43,550 --> 00:22:46,280
applications that's a lot to get through

532
00:22:46,280 --> 00:22:47,900
and it's gonna be a bottleneck for one

533
00:22:47,900 --> 00:22:50,360
person trying to manage all that but if

534
00:22:50,360 --> 00:22:52,520
you have ten lead developers across that

535
00:22:52,520 --> 00:22:55,070
who each oversee 50 apps and that's a

536
00:22:55,070 --> 00:22:57,980
lot but you know you could just work

537
00:22:57,980 --> 00:23:00,890
chase those 10 lead developers or you

538
00:23:00,890 --> 00:23:02,510
can work to become that lead developer

539
00:23:02,510 --> 00:23:04,910
who's gonna be proactive about the apps

540
00:23:04,910 --> 00:23:07,280
in your purview there and then you want

541
00:23:07,280 --> 00:23:09,200
to engage the emphasis information

542
00:23:09,200 --> 00:23:10,640
security management team so you're

543
00:23:10,640 --> 00:23:13,520
always going to run into the scenario

544
00:23:13,520 --> 00:23:16,100
where whatever tool you have that's

545
00:23:16,100 --> 00:23:18,430
reporting on your code vulnerabilities

546
00:23:18,430 --> 00:23:22,820
is gonna come into conflict with what

547
00:23:22,820 --> 00:23:24,470
that developer thinks needs to be done

548
00:23:24,470 --> 00:23:26,270
or with the risk appetite of that

549
00:23:26,270 --> 00:23:27,800
company and you need someone at your

550
00:23:27,800 --> 00:23:30,620
company who can lead and make those

551
00:23:30,620 --> 00:23:33,320
risk-based decisions so that's gonna be

552
00:23:33,320 --> 00:23:35,810
an example where we have a vulnerability

553
00:23:35,810 --> 00:23:37,850
but maybe there's a compensating control

554
00:23:37,850 --> 00:23:40,280
in place and so instead of fixing this

555
00:23:40,280 --> 00:23:41,990
with a code level corrective we're going

556
00:23:41,990 --> 00:23:43,610
to put it through a mitigation process

557
00:23:43,610 --> 00:23:48,200
because that risk is mitigated and then

558
00:23:48,200 --> 00:23:50,960
you want to attach this on to the

559
00:23:50,960 --> 00:23:53,420
projects or the problems that your

560
00:23:53,420 --> 00:23:55,790
organization is facing identifying what

561
00:23:55,790 --> 00:23:59,000
the business goals are so if you're

562
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:01,150
going into the you know digital

563
00:24:01,150 --> 00:24:03,440
transformation or if you have a cloud

564
00:24:03,440 --> 00:24:05,840
migration you haven't seen companies as

565
00:24:05,840 --> 00:24:08,660
part of their data center migration ad

566
00:24:08,660 --> 00:24:10,670
application security on as part of the

567
00:24:10,670 --> 00:24:12,800
checklist so an application isn't

568
00:24:12,800 --> 00:24:15,440
consider migrated until it goes through

569
00:24:15,440 --> 00:24:17,570
the application security onboarding is

570
00:24:17,570 --> 00:24:19,640
part of that process because it's it's

571
00:24:19,640 --> 00:24:21,120
too hard to try to do

572
00:24:21,120 --> 00:24:23,400
as a standalone project on top of

573
00:24:23,400 --> 00:24:25,920
everything else you're doing we see it

574
00:24:25,920 --> 00:24:27,960
with the micro service you know REO

575
00:24:27,960 --> 00:24:31,500
architecture and then key part is making

576
00:24:31,500 --> 00:24:33,990
sure that developers have the resources

577
00:24:33,990 --> 00:24:36,120
not only to identify the vulnerabilities

578
00:24:36,120 --> 00:24:38,280
in their code but to fix it that's where

579
00:24:38,280 --> 00:24:42,450
having developer coaches is is key

580
00:24:42,450 --> 00:24:45,960
remediation advice you don't just want

581
00:24:45,960 --> 00:24:48,690
to throw a PDF of vulnerabilities into

582
00:24:48,690 --> 00:24:52,290
someone's email box and and I mean think

583
00:24:52,290 --> 00:24:54,030
about that if I'm writing code and I'm

584
00:24:54,030 --> 00:24:55,680
introducing vulnerabilities the reason

585
00:24:55,680 --> 00:24:56,970
I'm doing that is because I don't know

586
00:24:56,970 --> 00:24:58,560
how to fix those or I don't know about

587
00:24:58,560 --> 00:25:01,740
it and otherwise that would fixed it so

588
00:25:01,740 --> 00:25:03,120
a lot of times I'm gonna want to get

589
00:25:03,120 --> 00:25:05,010
someone to show me on my code what's the

590
00:25:05,010 --> 00:25:06,540
least amount of effort I need to do to

591
00:25:06,540 --> 00:25:11,610
fix this to understand it and so you

592
00:25:11,610 --> 00:25:13,950
know that security training fits in

593
00:25:13,950 --> 00:25:16,020
there one of the things some of you guys

594
00:25:16,020 --> 00:25:18,150
were doing downstairs before this was

595
00:25:18,150 --> 00:25:21,120
you know code training right xxe is one

596
00:25:21,120 --> 00:25:22,980
of those vulnerabilities top ten

597
00:25:22,980 --> 00:25:26,340
category a four and so making sure that

598
00:25:26,340 --> 00:25:30,300
you've got those people who can be

599
00:25:30,300 --> 00:25:33,870
resources to help that case and you want

600
00:25:33,870 --> 00:25:35,670
to start advancing your application

601
00:25:35,670 --> 00:25:37,740
security program to the next stage and

602
00:25:37,740 --> 00:25:39,840
if you want to take a picture of this

603
00:25:39,840 --> 00:25:41,910
I'm not going to read it all but the

604
00:25:41,910 --> 00:25:44,070
idea is whatever stage you're in you

605
00:25:44,070 --> 00:25:46,200
want to put a plan in place to go to the

606
00:25:46,200 --> 00:25:49,950
next stage 30 60 90 day goals whether

607
00:25:49,950 --> 00:25:53,190
that what's the organization then that

608
00:25:53,190 --> 00:25:56,820
needs to be involved who do we need you

609
00:25:56,820 --> 00:25:58,590
know that support from what's the

610
00:25:58,590 --> 00:26:00,390
escalation process going to be how are

611
00:26:00,390 --> 00:26:04,410
we going to engage these teams and I've

612
00:26:04,410 --> 00:26:06,600
seen companies where they've they've

613
00:26:06,600 --> 00:26:08,520
wanted to go all-in and so they spent a

614
00:26:08,520 --> 00:26:10,680
quarter just putting an application

615
00:26:10,680 --> 00:26:12,780
security program in place lining up the

616
00:26:12,780 --> 00:26:14,430
teams like they were airplanes on a

617
00:26:14,430 --> 00:26:16,830
runway and then they they hit it and

618
00:26:16,830 --> 00:26:19,200
everything took off and and it launched

619
00:26:19,200 --> 00:26:20,370
and I've seen other teams where they've

620
00:26:20,370 --> 00:26:22,620
said look we're gonna start with these

621
00:26:22,620 --> 00:26:24,510
guys because we're friends and they're a

622
00:26:24,510 --> 00:26:27,990
friendly team and they go through a four

623
00:26:27,990 --> 00:26:31,020
month period of greenfield code

624
00:26:31,020 --> 00:26:32,790
development releasing their brand-new

625
00:26:32,790 --> 00:26:34,240
app no vulnerabilities and they

626
00:26:34,240 --> 00:26:36,400
do an internal press release saying you

627
00:26:36,400 --> 00:26:39,070
know so entomb had an on-time deployment

628
00:26:39,070 --> 00:26:40,240
of their application with zero

629
00:26:40,240 --> 00:26:41,920
vulnerabilities here's how they did it

630
00:26:41,920 --> 00:26:44,590
start lining up so we can help you as

631
00:26:44,590 --> 00:26:47,410
well you want to you want to get that

632
00:26:47,410 --> 00:26:49,660
integration that automation going and

633
00:26:49,660 --> 00:26:51,460
you want to start talking about

634
00:26:51,460 --> 00:26:54,970
application security daily with with

635
00:26:54,970 --> 00:26:59,020
developers and then you know for each

636
00:26:59,020 --> 00:27:02,110
one of those stages we can have you know

637
00:27:02,110 --> 00:27:05,110
checklist of things that you can work on

638
00:27:05,110 --> 00:27:09,100
and you could put easily put a plan in

639
00:27:09,100 --> 00:27:13,059
place there I'll leave that up for a

640
00:27:13,059 --> 00:27:19,830
second at that point so again it's

641
00:27:19,830 --> 00:27:22,900
developers its security its operation

642
00:27:22,900 --> 00:27:26,400
it's sometimes you want that third-party

643
00:27:26,400 --> 00:27:29,830
independent kind of auditing of what the

644
00:27:29,830 --> 00:27:31,840
paper policy says and what the actual

645
00:27:31,840 --> 00:27:34,240
process looks like in reality and and

646
00:27:34,240 --> 00:27:36,580
where are the gaps and why are those

647
00:27:36,580 --> 00:27:39,880
failing so let's get clued with another

648
00:27:39,880 --> 00:27:43,559
look at cwe 611 maybe you're not writing

649
00:27:43,559 --> 00:27:47,650
applications that are using XML so why

650
00:27:47,650 --> 00:27:53,460
do I need to know about this but you do

651
00:27:53,460 --> 00:27:57,220
one of one of the ideas that's out there

652
00:27:57,220 --> 00:27:58,630
that probably some of these people some

653
00:27:58,630 --> 00:28:00,370
of you in the room are using hopefully

654
00:28:00,370 --> 00:28:02,050
you have a patched version but one of

655
00:28:02,050 --> 00:28:05,590
the ideas that's out there had a cwe 611

656
00:28:05,590 --> 00:28:09,510
vulnerability it was vulnerable to XML

657
00:28:09,510 --> 00:28:12,550
external entity injection so what that

658
00:28:12,550 --> 00:28:14,550
meant is if you went to github and you

659
00:28:14,550 --> 00:28:17,890
cloned an application that had an XML

660
00:28:17,890 --> 00:28:20,920
file in it so let's say you cloned an

661
00:28:20,920 --> 00:28:23,320
app for an Android application that's

662
00:28:23,320 --> 00:28:25,840
using the apk tool and it has an Android

663
00:28:25,840 --> 00:28:28,420
manifest XML and you open that up in

664
00:28:28,420 --> 00:28:31,420
your IDE if there was malicious code in

665
00:28:31,420 --> 00:28:34,240
that XML file it would exploit that

666
00:28:34,240 --> 00:28:36,160
vulnerability on your machine as a

667
00:28:36,160 --> 00:28:39,580
developer so what that means is local

668
00:28:39,580 --> 00:28:42,679
files in your system can be read

669
00:28:42,679 --> 00:28:44,850
access to servers on your internal

670
00:28:44,850 --> 00:28:46,650
network could be accessed you could do

671
00:28:46,650 --> 00:28:49,980
internal port scanning you know a number

672
00:28:49,980 --> 00:28:52,230
of things basically could be run under

673
00:28:52,230 --> 00:28:56,010
whatever privileges your developer

674
00:28:56,010 --> 00:28:57,840
machine has and this is the same thing

675
00:28:57,840 --> 00:28:59,130
if you have the vulnerability on the web

676
00:28:59,130 --> 00:29:01,799
server someone's going to interject

677
00:29:01,799 --> 00:29:03,929
inject some code that's going to read

678
00:29:03,929 --> 00:29:06,570
that C password file or or do something

679
00:29:06,570 --> 00:29:09,750
else and send it out just all by opening

680
00:29:09,750 --> 00:29:12,360
up an XML file and so that was something

681
00:29:12,360 --> 00:29:14,190
that you know if you just clone

682
00:29:14,190 --> 00:29:15,960
something on github as a developer

683
00:29:15,960 --> 00:29:19,409
you're now being exposed to and so even

684
00:29:19,409 --> 00:29:21,480
if you're not writing in XML knowing

685
00:29:21,480 --> 00:29:23,700
what the Olas top 10 are knowing what

686
00:29:23,700 --> 00:29:25,740
these vulnerabilities are and talking to

687
00:29:25,740 --> 00:29:27,390
the people at your organization is going

688
00:29:27,390 --> 00:29:29,549
to create that momentum create that

689
00:29:29,549 --> 00:29:32,039
culture change and so that's that's my

690
00:29:32,039 --> 00:29:33,419
action to start discussing the

691
00:29:33,419 --> 00:29:36,179
application security daily with your

692
00:29:36,179 --> 00:29:38,580
teams and you'll you'll have examples

693
00:29:38,580 --> 00:29:40,710
where you're you're now getting the

694
00:29:40,710 --> 00:29:43,169
front and that that goal of that having

695
00:29:43,169 --> 00:29:46,080
that zero flaw deployment is going to be

696
00:29:46,080 --> 00:29:47,460
something teams are going to start to

697
00:29:47,460 --> 00:29:49,799
get excited about and it's not going to

698
00:29:49,799 --> 00:29:51,090
mean there's no vulnerabilities in the

699
00:29:51,090 --> 00:29:52,289
application but it means you're doing

700
00:29:52,289 --> 00:29:54,240
your due diligence and the

701
00:29:54,240 --> 00:29:56,700
vulnerabilities that you have you know

702
00:29:56,700 --> 00:29:58,409
about they're not just sitting in a

703
00:29:58,409 --> 00:29:59,789
backlog but they've actually been

704
00:29:59,789 --> 00:30:04,169
addressed when it's cheapest and you

705
00:30:04,169 --> 00:30:06,929
know you'll hear the one example of a

706
00:30:06,929 --> 00:30:08,970
team that I was on a conference call

707
00:30:08,970 --> 00:30:11,220
with last week they were sharing with 50

708
00:30:11,220 --> 00:30:13,409
other developers their experience of

709
00:30:13,409 --> 00:30:15,299
going for months

710
00:30:15,299 --> 00:30:17,909
Brent from starting their project to

711
00:30:17,909 --> 00:30:19,620
deploying with zero vulnerabilities and

712
00:30:19,620 --> 00:30:21,120
they said it took about an extra maybe

713
00:30:21,120 --> 00:30:24,299
2% of their time to do all the

714
00:30:24,299 --> 00:30:26,220
applications security pieces for the

715
00:30:26,220 --> 00:30:27,630
first time and that's you know the

716
00:30:27,630 --> 00:30:29,640
one-time steps of integrating with the

717
00:30:29,640 --> 00:30:32,850
CI CD process and going from there so

718
00:30:32,850 --> 00:30:36,360
they they felt very much like the the

719
00:30:36,360 --> 00:30:38,220
burden that was lifted off of them from

720
00:30:38,220 --> 00:30:40,049
not having known vulnerabilities in

721
00:30:40,049 --> 00:30:42,539
their codes was well worth you know it's

722
00:30:42,539 --> 00:30:45,720
an extra few hours of time to get that

723
00:30:45,720 --> 00:30:50,250
set up and so that's how that's one way

724
00:30:50,250 --> 00:30:53,059
you can start changing the culture

725
00:30:53,059 --> 00:30:55,399
and and hopefully that's something that

726
00:30:55,399 --> 00:30:59,990
we can all take back from there so we've

727
00:30:59,990 --> 00:31:01,999
got some time for any questions if you

728
00:31:01,999 --> 00:31:05,240
guys happen otherwise I'm I'll be

729
00:31:05,240 --> 00:31:06,789
downstairs and feel free to stop by

730
00:31:06,789 --> 00:31:09,999
thank you yes

731
00:31:10,350 --> 00:31:16,889
[Applause]

732
00:31:22,060 --> 00:31:24,120
you
