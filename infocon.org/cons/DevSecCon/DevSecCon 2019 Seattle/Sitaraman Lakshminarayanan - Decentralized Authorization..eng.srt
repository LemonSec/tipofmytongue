00:00:03,820 --> 00:00:06,869
[Music]

2
00:00:20,510 --> 00:00:26,620
[Applause]

3
00:00:28,519 --> 00:00:33,690
shop where you will be talking about

4
00:00:33,690 --> 00:00:41,579
recent responsibilities no blockchain so

5
00:00:41,579 --> 00:00:44,430
the first question is authorized to talk

6
00:00:44,430 --> 00:00:47,390
about this topic right so in this case

7
00:00:47,390 --> 00:00:51,000
subject it's meat prom the research

8
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:53,520
we're going to talk about is in this

9
00:00:53,520 --> 00:00:55,860
context is I work for different as a

10
00:00:55,860 --> 00:01:02,690
senior security architect actions

11
00:01:02,950 --> 00:01:07,000
cerissa security Honea security of our

12
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:12,180
group few other attributes about myself

13
00:01:13,350 --> 00:01:16,000
yeah I can speak about rule is never

14
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:18,490
controlled find your next to trouble and

15
00:01:18,490 --> 00:01:22,360
any other things around security sit

16
00:01:22,360 --> 00:01:24,850
but the bigger question is why should we

17
00:01:24,850 --> 00:01:27,450
talk about transition here in this

18
00:01:27,450 --> 00:01:31,300
conference almost all the talk but

19
00:01:31,300 --> 00:01:34,090
majority kept up water on finding level

20
00:01:34,090 --> 00:01:43,900
1315 almost acted as security people we

21
00:01:43,900 --> 00:01:46,770
are in the mix between developers

22
00:01:46,770 --> 00:01:51,580
customers managers living since our goal

23
00:01:51,580 --> 00:01:53,920
to help development team to find the

24
00:01:53,920 --> 00:01:56,470
answers instead of being the team that

25
00:01:56,470 --> 00:01:59,960
says why are you not doing this

26
00:01:59,960 --> 00:02:03,140
authorization instead guide on the right

27
00:02:03,140 --> 00:02:07,070
direction and just pointing someone the

28
00:02:07,070 --> 00:02:15,860
right directions so let's talk about

29
00:02:15,860 --> 00:02:19,820
what is authorization right it's about

30
00:02:19,820 --> 00:02:22,880
the subject user or an application or a

31
00:02:22,880 --> 00:02:26,480
service which is trying to access a

32
00:02:26,480 --> 00:02:30,140
resource it can be API the application

33
00:02:30,140 --> 00:02:33,410
or anything else and you're trying to do

34
00:02:33,410 --> 00:02:36,500
an action actually can be read update

35
00:02:36,500 --> 00:02:41,570
delete approve deny so what is the

36
00:02:41,570 --> 00:02:44,959
subject is allowed to do or actions on

37
00:02:44,959 --> 00:02:47,770
that particular research that's

38
00:02:47,770 --> 00:02:50,590
authorization in a nutshell but then

39
00:02:50,590 --> 00:02:54,680
there are different flavors of it you

40
00:02:54,680 --> 00:02:55,970
can talk about role based access control

41
00:02:55,970 --> 00:02:57,680
find reactors that will attribute

42
00:02:57,680 --> 00:03:00,050
rejected control and you can go on and

43
00:03:00,050 --> 00:03:03,380
on so if you talk but role based access

44
00:03:03,380 --> 00:03:06,019
control is constant to district you have

45
00:03:06,019 --> 00:03:08,930
set up users you are signed up to a

46
00:03:08,930 --> 00:03:15,080
group of likely to begin a tu you assign

47
00:03:15,080 --> 00:03:17,450
those leads to a row and then those

48
00:03:17,450 --> 00:03:20,290
roles are assigned to resources enacted

49
00:03:20,290 --> 00:03:23,660
so this is what role based access

50
00:03:23,660 --> 00:03:26,930
control works and this is what people

51
00:03:26,930 --> 00:03:29,480
have been doing for mmm it's continues

52
00:03:29,480 --> 00:03:34,519
to be the case so if I were to ask any

53
00:03:34,519 --> 00:03:37,989
double to any developer here

54
00:03:38,510 --> 00:03:41,450
if I ask any doctor to implement

55
00:03:41,450 --> 00:03:43,459
role-based access control most likely

56
00:03:43,459 --> 00:03:45,590
would you agree with this you would

57
00:03:45,590 --> 00:03:51,680
heart could if rolling pulse whatever

58
00:03:51,680 --> 00:03:53,150
that all you want for your application

59
00:03:53,150 --> 00:03:56,330
and then if it's there you can return

60
00:03:56,330 --> 00:03:58,730
true or false so this would most likely

61
00:03:58,730 --> 00:04:00,920
be the case there the authorization

62
00:04:00,920 --> 00:04:04,040
rules are are put into the code and then

63
00:04:04,040 --> 00:04:06,140
you make your decision as good gets

64
00:04:06,140 --> 00:04:10,040
complex you bury yourself deeper by

65
00:04:10,040 --> 00:04:19,820
adding more conditions the operation is

66
00:04:19,820 --> 00:04:21,889
Deborah girls and rights their

67
00:04:21,889 --> 00:04:26,360
authorization body and the security team

68
00:04:26,360 --> 00:04:29,030
will say are you doing the right thing

69
00:04:29,030 --> 00:04:30,919
do you have controls in place or are you

70
00:04:30,919 --> 00:04:34,250
doing the need-to-know basis type of

71
00:04:34,250 --> 00:04:37,550
access control and operation team was

72
00:04:37,550 --> 00:04:40,490
left running those applications

73
00:04:40,490 --> 00:04:44,210
monitoring and everything else so what

74
00:04:44,210 --> 00:04:48,800
happens is when a security can go to

75
00:04:48,800 --> 00:04:52,330
reviews those code we ask the question

76
00:04:52,330 --> 00:04:55,460
can I change the stroke oui madame

77
00:04:55,460 --> 00:04:57,830
parametric you're buying a product and

78
00:04:57,830 --> 00:05:00,650
it has come to rob a successful polling

79
00:05:00,650 --> 00:05:03,590
place and you are the security team the

80
00:05:03,590 --> 00:05:05,630
other thing I want to change what the

81
00:05:05,630 --> 00:05:07,099
role means because I don't want to give

82
00:05:07,099 --> 00:05:08,060
so much permissions

83
00:05:08,060 --> 00:05:10,900
I don't want manage it

84
00:05:10,900 --> 00:05:15,469
certainly sir it's because your policy

85
00:05:15,469 --> 00:05:17,740
because suppression duties it's because

86
00:05:17,740 --> 00:05:20,270
better security control for every nation

87
00:05:20,270 --> 00:05:24,289
back in those things happens the answer

88
00:05:24,289 --> 00:05:29,180
is don't know they have to go back and

89
00:05:29,180 --> 00:05:32,389
rewrite the code or the abscess question

90
00:05:32,389 --> 00:05:34,249
in the beginning different a magazine I

91
00:05:34,249 --> 00:05:36,770
can redesign my role based access

92
00:05:36,770 --> 00:05:41,449
control in a way it is flexible now can

93
00:05:41,449 --> 00:05:42,650
I ask the same question to the same

94
00:05:42,650 --> 00:05:45,469
dollar rate and how would you redesign

95
00:05:45,469 --> 00:05:48,139
your access control there what are the

96
00:05:48,139 --> 00:05:58,969
role means and change after the fun this

97
00:05:58,969 --> 00:06:01,909
is one version I have done this instead

98
00:06:01,909 --> 00:06:04,370
of our 20 year olds within the code that

99
00:06:04,370 --> 00:06:06,639
you're writing you tend to have sign

100
00:06:06,639 --> 00:06:08,990
literal strings where are called

101
00:06:08,990 --> 00:06:11,629
permissions so you map control through

102
00:06:11,629 --> 00:06:14,149
certain permissions and permission that

103
00:06:14,149 --> 00:06:18,020
really means it's edit something delete

104
00:06:18,020 --> 00:06:21,740
something created approve workflow

105
00:06:21,740 --> 00:06:25,399
whatever those actions are so now we go

106
00:06:25,399 --> 00:06:28,310
from rose to resource rich games in the

107
00:06:28,310 --> 00:06:31,789
code we have a separation there robots

108
00:06:31,789 --> 00:06:34,189
to set up permissions and then the

109
00:06:34,189 --> 00:06:35,990
groups are assigned to the rows in this

110
00:06:35,990 --> 00:06:37,510
case now we have master to the

111
00:06:37,510 --> 00:06:39,700
customer or the security team to say so

112
00:06:39,700 --> 00:06:41,320
if you don't like what you having to go

113
00:06:41,320 --> 00:06:42,010
back in

114
00:06:42,010 --> 00:06:45,340
mana fit what the rule means I've

115
00:06:45,340 --> 00:06:47,850
disliked this I've done this before

116
00:06:47,850 --> 00:06:50,320
because before I started doing this and

117
00:06:50,320 --> 00:06:52,260
I've done this many times before excited

118
00:06:52,260 --> 00:06:54,970
until it is partly deployed in the

119
00:06:54,970 --> 00:06:58,660
direction so what happens is when you do

120
00:06:58,660 --> 00:07:00,700
plans and prejudices back to the

121
00:07:00,700 --> 00:07:03,520
Infinity rumor Julian's keen on this

122
00:07:03,520 --> 00:07:06,130
morning we're like 10 15 years ago

123
00:07:06,130 --> 00:07:09,040
design develop test review security

124
00:07:09,040 --> 00:07:12,010
comes and stops you from doing it so so

125
00:07:12,010 --> 00:07:14,350
in this case their development is

126
00:07:14,350 --> 00:07:15,910
complete you turn it over to the

127
00:07:15,910 --> 00:07:19,450
operations team they are dealt with

128
00:07:19,450 --> 00:07:21,270
adding resources and permissions

129
00:07:21,270 --> 00:07:24,130
creating new roles mapping dues what

130
00:07:24,130 --> 00:07:25,570
those roles means to the personnel

131
00:07:25,570 --> 00:07:29,830
permissions and this is insane because

132
00:07:29,830 --> 00:07:33,160
this is where the development and

133
00:07:33,160 --> 00:07:35,050
security and operations teams are not

134
00:07:35,050 --> 00:07:40,120
working together to solve a problem if

135
00:07:40,120 --> 00:07:41,410
you don't know what this means

136
00:07:41,410 --> 00:07:43,900
you might want to listen to this water

137
00:07:43,900 --> 00:07:47,680
spot when besides Noah which is really

138
00:07:47,680 --> 00:07:50,520
good presentation that talks about how

139
00:07:50,520 --> 00:07:53,860
them and say hawks kind of need to work

140
00:07:53,860 --> 00:07:57,190
together see it's your operations guy

141
00:07:57,190 --> 00:07:59,710
this is what it is it because you've

142
00:07:59,710 --> 00:08:02,470
given the pages pages of information

143
00:08:02,470 --> 00:08:04,990
that I have go back and edit what max

144
00:08:04,990 --> 00:08:07,240
control should look like for every

145
00:08:07,240 --> 00:08:08,950
combination of

146
00:08:08,950 --> 00:08:13,210
yes 4 1 5 10 15 30 that are running in

147
00:08:13,210 --> 00:08:19,330
my network so the event from hard-coded

148
00:08:19,330 --> 00:08:21,490
to centralized authorizations the

149
00:08:21,490 --> 00:08:23,160
simplest authorization was pushed

150
00:08:23,160 --> 00:08:28,480
because then it was in individual put in

151
00:08:28,480 --> 00:08:30,910
the code nobody know exactly who has

152
00:08:30,910 --> 00:08:33,909
permissions to what sarbanes-oxley King

153
00:08:33,909 --> 00:08:36,640
then you had the vendor which came in

154
00:08:36,640 --> 00:08:38,830
and said single sign-on will solve every

155
00:08:38,830 --> 00:08:41,320
problem the Vatican will solve every

156
00:08:41,320 --> 00:08:41,890
problem

157
00:08:41,890 --> 00:08:43,450
so everybody centralized the

158
00:08:43,450 --> 00:08:45,820
authorization either customer products

159
00:08:45,820 --> 00:08:49,800
or homegrown solutions whatever it is

160
00:08:49,800 --> 00:08:52,300
but the challenge is that if you are

161
00:08:52,300 --> 00:08:54,100
building a new application that has to

162
00:08:54,100 --> 00:08:56,380
fill into your centralized authorization

163
00:08:56,380 --> 00:08:58,570
model as a double / you need to

164
00:08:58,570 --> 00:09:00,430
understand Hardware configure how's this

165
00:09:00,430 --> 00:09:02,260
going to work how do I design my

166
00:09:02,260 --> 00:09:03,640
resources in Scituate

167
00:09:03,640 --> 00:09:06,850
I have hierarchy of resources by his own

168
00:09:06,850 --> 00:09:09,460
your application panels or UI and

169
00:09:09,460 --> 00:09:11,680
whatever it is you have to know all of

170
00:09:11,680 --> 00:09:13,810
them in your designing your of the

171
00:09:13,810 --> 00:09:16,690
carrandi I develop this application can

172
00:09:16,690 --> 00:09:18,400
I go configure access control no it

173
00:09:18,400 --> 00:09:22,780
doesn't work that way now when you want

174
00:09:22,780 --> 00:09:25,150
to change policies and permissions

175
00:09:25,150 --> 00:09:29,080
again it gets complicated because when

176
00:09:29,080 --> 00:09:30,640
the administrator goes through changes

177
00:09:30,640 --> 00:09:34,060
the policy role for permission if that's

178
00:09:34,060 --> 00:09:37,870
not what you meant in your code your

179
00:09:37,870 --> 00:09:39,399
if you are not done the hierarchy

180
00:09:39,399 --> 00:09:42,670
correct your routine as a man and

181
00:09:42,670 --> 00:09:45,279
apparently can do your direct reports

182
00:09:45,279 --> 00:09:48,100
salary commission and if the hierarchy

183
00:09:48,100 --> 00:09:50,890
is not done right the code is not in

184
00:09:50,890 --> 00:09:52,829
permissions are done in different ways

185
00:09:52,829 --> 00:09:56,050
and it slows down the time that's why

186
00:09:56,050 --> 00:10:01,360
time to go higher so we serve Hartford

187
00:10:01,360 --> 00:10:03,970
it does not work because every time we

188
00:10:03,970 --> 00:10:06,160
need a change you have to go back in and

189
00:10:06,160 --> 00:10:10,269
change the code and the centralized

190
00:10:10,269 --> 00:10:13,149
model is not what work because it's

191
00:10:13,149 --> 00:10:14,980
slowing down things you have to

192
00:10:14,980 --> 00:10:16,870
understand how is improvisation system

193
00:10:16,870 --> 00:10:19,930
works how you design your service and

194
00:10:19,930 --> 00:10:22,480
everybody is asked to stick to a

195
00:10:22,480 --> 00:10:25,000
specific contract as how its how you

196
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:27,790
design your service

197
00:10:27,790 --> 00:10:32,350
what if you externalize your

198
00:10:32,350 --> 00:10:34,750
authorization they go again nothing you

199
00:10:34,750 --> 00:10:37,380
cannot do that

200
00:10:39,040 --> 00:10:41,990
but this is the key different provide

201
00:10:41,990 --> 00:10:44,270
developers with full control over how

202
00:10:44,270 --> 00:10:45,529
they can actually write the

203
00:10:45,529 --> 00:10:46,610
authorization code

204
00:10:46,610 --> 00:10:48,500
you don't have to duty there's no one

205
00:10:48,500 --> 00:10:50,510
security team that says here is my

206
00:10:50,510 --> 00:10:52,520
authorization service these are the

207
00:10:52,520 --> 00:10:55,790
10-15 parameters here in pass and this

208
00:10:55,790 --> 00:10:57,290
authorization will do the lodging for

209
00:10:57,290 --> 00:11:00,380
you how to enforce the rules if you have

210
00:11:00,380 --> 00:11:02,480
your parameters 30 it will work if you

211
00:11:02,480 --> 00:11:05,560
don't it's not going to work

212
00:11:05,560 --> 00:11:07,640
do you don't have to say that right so

213
00:11:07,640 --> 00:11:11,720
what if we can write the authorization

214
00:11:11,720 --> 00:11:14,150
to look everyone and then the same thing

215
00:11:14,150 --> 00:11:16,220
once it's deploy is there it is your

216
00:11:16,220 --> 00:11:17,750
product that you're deploying for your

217
00:11:17,750 --> 00:11:19,520
customers or your security team come to

218
00:11:19,520 --> 00:11:22,040
look for an internal project and then

219
00:11:22,040 --> 00:11:25,190
they say oh this authorization policy is

220
00:11:25,190 --> 00:11:27,110
the violate separation of duty or

221
00:11:27,110 --> 00:11:29,270
compliance or something they can go back

222
00:11:29,270 --> 00:11:31,550
and change it without having anyone

223
00:11:31,550 --> 00:11:35,480
rewriting the code again and it does not

224
00:11:35,480 --> 00:11:37,700
involve an opera from here so if you

225
00:11:37,700 --> 00:11:39,920
repeat in a scenario where you can

226
00:11:39,920 --> 00:11:42,170
figure bunch of rules and yet migrate

227
00:11:42,170 --> 00:11:44,450
and all this far from devastating

228
00:11:44,450 --> 00:11:47,540
depression or stress that might needs

229
00:11:47,540 --> 00:11:50,420
from one database to another its opinion

230
00:11:50,420 --> 00:11:56,210
doesn't normally go smooth so and you

231
00:11:56,210 --> 00:11:57,980
get that quantitative

232
00:11:57,980 --> 00:12:01,010
time to deploy it's faster you go along

233
00:12:01,010 --> 00:12:04,490
with the team of CICE process or the

234
00:12:04,490 --> 00:12:10,100
buzzword is false and the other thing is

235
00:12:10,100 --> 00:12:11,870
what if we also give the same

236
00:12:11,870 --> 00:12:15,770
in a way that the authorization policies

237
00:12:15,770 --> 00:12:17,690
are written in a consistent manner

238
00:12:17,690 --> 00:12:19,970
think of it like when you look at any

239
00:12:19,970 --> 00:12:23,390
database code today it's all simple if

240
00:12:23,390 --> 00:12:26,150
you understand what's SQL means you can

241
00:12:26,150 --> 00:12:29,210
write putting these articles single

242
00:12:29,210 --> 00:12:33,710
server and what if you give them a tool

243
00:12:33,710 --> 00:12:35,630
that rights policies innovates

244
00:12:35,630 --> 00:12:38,900
consistent across any development stack

245
00:12:38,900 --> 00:12:42,920
that is going to work with so this is

246
00:12:42,920 --> 00:12:45,440
what I'm talking about is called open

247
00:12:45,440 --> 00:12:47,960
policy so for those who are being

248
00:12:47,960 --> 00:12:49,820
working in this industry for a while and

249
00:12:49,820 --> 00:12:52,400
know about the pain points of our back

250
00:12:52,400 --> 00:12:54,920
find an access control before oppa

251
00:12:54,920 --> 00:12:59,150
became this concept of these predators

252
00:12:59,150 --> 00:13:00,920
in between the roaster console called

253
00:13:00,920 --> 00:13:03,110
zaqqum extensible access control markup

254
00:13:03,110 --> 00:13:06,380
language which did not go well the

255
00:13:06,380 --> 00:13:08,480
adoption because of our commercial

256
00:13:08,480 --> 00:13:11,960
production from vendors so this is not

257
00:13:11,960 --> 00:13:13,330
the first time

258
00:13:13,330 --> 00:13:16,930
this was right before yeah so what is

259
00:13:16,930 --> 00:13:20,470
open policy agent so if you separate out

260
00:13:20,470 --> 00:13:22,630
the application logic that's your

261
00:13:22,630 --> 00:13:24,790
business funding and externalize the

262
00:13:24,790 --> 00:13:27,779
authorization into a separate service

263
00:13:27,779 --> 00:13:30,760
that's the natural world or does to the

264
00:13:30,760 --> 00:13:35,920
service receive directness and forces

265
00:13:35,920 --> 00:13:37,540
the policy because you're offering this

266
00:13:37,540 --> 00:13:41,769
money and these policy files are outside

267
00:13:41,769 --> 00:13:44,140
of their code which means I can go back

268
00:13:44,140 --> 00:13:46,300
and modify my authorization policies

269
00:13:46,300 --> 00:13:49,720
after the development is done after the

270
00:13:49,720 --> 00:13:52,540
department is done because there is a

271
00:13:52,540 --> 00:13:54,940
compliance violation or you found out

272
00:13:54,940 --> 00:13:58,690
that you give it more minutes it's

273
00:13:58,690 --> 00:14:01,390
returned Rodrigo brigov and reflected

274
00:14:01,390 --> 00:14:04,990
came from j-rok it's a crazy language

275
00:14:04,990 --> 00:14:08,170
the way equipped they go and open policy

276
00:14:08,170 --> 00:14:11,410
it in context is it's like sequel for

277
00:14:11,410 --> 00:14:13,630
Jesus when you look at when you love

278
00:14:13,630 --> 00:14:15,670
rego you're actually learning I've been

279
00:14:15,670 --> 00:14:18,870
doing right Australasian rules across

280
00:14:18,870 --> 00:14:26,670
education system so again this is a very

281
00:14:26,670 --> 00:14:30,750
brief example I copy from the other side

282
00:14:30,750 --> 00:14:35,320
it's already some point you should write

283
00:14:35,320 --> 00:14:37,240
a package you have the rainbow which is

284
00:14:37,240 --> 00:14:39,590
in the hardware in here or you can refer

285
00:14:39,590 --> 00:14:42,890
a viable site and this is the main block

286
00:14:42,890 --> 00:14:45,050
where you're just saying because the

287
00:14:45,050 --> 00:14:47,510
material world right as I didn't matter

288
00:14:47,510 --> 00:14:49,730
the condition that the input method

289
00:14:49,730 --> 00:14:52,130
whose get you have two different axes is

290
00:14:52,130 --> 00:14:54,529
one on this part and the usually matches

291
00:14:54,529 --> 00:14:58,520
then you have the user turn in Access so

292
00:14:58,520 --> 00:15:00,380
this is algorithm once it's written it's

293
00:15:00,380 --> 00:15:02,300
actually made available for you as an

294
00:15:02,300 --> 00:15:04,790
HTTP it guides from a developer's

295
00:15:04,790 --> 00:15:09,860
context it's all API interactions the

296
00:15:09,860 --> 00:15:12,620
other you get with hope as a framework

297
00:15:12,620 --> 00:15:15,860
can actually provide me the decision

298
00:15:15,860 --> 00:15:17,750
loss so if you read right there all

299
00:15:17,750 --> 00:15:19,940
centralized authorization service you

300
00:15:19,940 --> 00:15:23,540
have tried the framework to log all the

301
00:15:23,540 --> 00:15:25,279
evolved into night decisions and

302
00:15:25,279 --> 00:15:27,860
anything else oppa has a framework for

303
00:15:27,860 --> 00:15:30,740
it so you can write it can't go to spa

304
00:15:30,740 --> 00:15:33,860
or any other system that you're using it

305
00:15:33,860 --> 00:15:35,960
has an option to the tournament free

306
00:15:35,960 --> 00:15:39,920
certificate for this reason now the

307
00:15:39,920 --> 00:15:42,020
policy file the activities can be

308
00:15:42,020 --> 00:15:44,120
individual files can be seen bundle all

309
00:15:44,120 --> 00:15:47,060
of them into one bundle like a toughie

310
00:15:47,060 --> 00:15:50,180
and that can be distributed so the

311
00:15:50,180 --> 00:15:53,000
Mirador perhaps it has a

312
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:56,600
new policy it building up those apology

313
00:15:56,600 --> 00:16:01,070
every five 10 15 minutes so now you have

314
00:16:01,070 --> 00:16:04,580
option there as developer rights

315
00:16:04,580 --> 00:16:07,100
you could replace them the policies in

316
00:16:07,100 --> 00:16:11,480
the opinion without having to go and

317
00:16:11,480 --> 00:16:13,130
give you your authorization innocent

318
00:16:13,130 --> 00:16:17,510
register let's look at it from a

319
00:16:17,510 --> 00:16:19,310
developer standpoint what does it go

320
00:16:19,310 --> 00:16:22,520
colloquial it's a new language it's

321
00:16:22,520 --> 00:16:25,310
something's cutting once you return to

322
00:16:25,310 --> 00:16:27,560
the original policy other does is I'm

323
00:16:27,560 --> 00:16:29,600
using an API services in example so you

324
00:16:29,600 --> 00:16:31,880
have an API client rather than looking

325
00:16:31,880 --> 00:16:35,030
at regular HTTP yeah so now when you

326
00:16:35,030 --> 00:16:37,970
look at EBI everybody was written API

327
00:16:37,970 --> 00:16:40,000
has petitioned before I've done this

328
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:43,520
either Spring Framework or custom

329
00:16:43,520 --> 00:16:46,490
machine HEPA filters you've written this

330
00:16:46,490 --> 00:16:51,080
where you look at the incoming pillow or

331
00:16:51,080 --> 00:16:54,140
head and based on that you make decision

332
00:16:54,140 --> 00:16:56,090
to either you write to the library chat

333
00:16:56,090 --> 00:16:58,610
library so in this week we can write a

334
00:16:58,610 --> 00:17:00,740
filter or it can be in the canary

335
00:17:00,740 --> 00:17:04,150
happiness to go proxy

336
00:17:06,959 --> 00:17:10,378
yeah intercessor it makes me sleepy call

337
00:17:10,378 --> 00:17:13,169
to the local service passing the input

338
00:17:13,169 --> 00:17:15,539
test occasional the input can be here is

339
00:17:15,539 --> 00:17:17,099
the resource somebody's paying taxes

340
00:17:17,099 --> 00:17:20,249
Kennedy used to me he'll do the actions

341
00:17:20,249 --> 00:17:23,128
and get and you can send any of the fuel

342
00:17:23,128 --> 00:17:27,388
that is our ability drivers that's it

343
00:17:27,388 --> 00:17:30,809
that's all the rest now since they know

344
00:17:30,809 --> 00:17:32,340
the business product better they know

345
00:17:32,340 --> 00:17:34,799
they are closer to the product they can

346
00:17:34,799 --> 00:17:37,080
write the authorization rules externally

347
00:17:37,080 --> 00:17:39,869
code same as they used right before

348
00:17:39,869 --> 00:17:41,369
which is mark where they can have to

349
00:17:41,369 --> 00:17:43,799
simple role based access control five

350
00:17:43,799 --> 00:17:46,200
minutes is control however they want

351
00:17:46,200 --> 00:17:49,110
it's her business project her Department

352
00:17:49,110 --> 00:17:54,749
it's very and introduce back and yes or

353
00:17:54,749 --> 00:17:55,139
no

354
00:17:55,139 --> 00:17:56,700
we can also written by traditional

355
00:17:56,700 --> 00:18:01,710
behavior and then you access the again

356
00:18:01,710 --> 00:18:07,139
it's completely transparent so now if

357
00:18:07,139 --> 00:18:12,980
you have an extra mites policy you

358
00:18:12,980 --> 00:18:15,269
application pocket the object is

359
00:18:15,269 --> 00:18:16,740
basically saying okay I'm going to use

360
00:18:16,740 --> 00:18:20,279
the pockets to go my external policy

361
00:18:20,279 --> 00:18:23,920
stories and that's it gives me a bath

362
00:18:23,920 --> 00:18:26,470
policy service can be the policy files

363
00:18:26,470 --> 00:18:29,770
can be updated independent of your

364
00:18:29,770 --> 00:18:32,140
publication contract so the policy

365
00:18:32,140 --> 00:18:34,150
pockets are better on a daily basis our

366
00:18:34,150 --> 00:18:36,820
weekly basis were learn based on how you

367
00:18:36,820 --> 00:18:38,740
want to fine-tune your authorization

368
00:18:38,740 --> 00:18:41,620
parameters and that does not affect it

369
00:18:41,620 --> 00:18:44,310
for it all right now

370
00:18:45,420 --> 00:18:48,180
freedom what I can't relate this back

371
00:18:48,180 --> 00:18:50,110
responsive particularly you know the

372
00:18:50,110 --> 00:18:51,940
concept is not be involved if you only

373
00:18:51,940 --> 00:18:54,010
can use it about writing your of

374
00:18:54,010 --> 00:18:57,210
revelation groups and freedom and the

375
00:18:57,210 --> 00:19:06,250
open policy agent of the framework as if

376
00:19:06,250 --> 00:19:07,480
you're familiar with communities

377
00:19:07,480 --> 00:19:14,380
authorization model it's the cumulative

378
00:19:14,380 --> 00:19:16,510
autism or we look at it it comes with

379
00:19:16,510 --> 00:19:19,230
any for all these access control it has

380
00:19:19,230 --> 00:19:22,540
extensions for doing absolutely slices

381
00:19:22,540 --> 00:19:25,480
people but the best thing is it has I

382
00:19:25,480 --> 00:19:33,870
think if you don't buy these in every

383
00:19:33,870 --> 00:19:36,949
[Applause]

384
00:19:37,230 --> 00:19:38,910
you can write this in Python Java

385
00:19:38,910 --> 00:19:42,150
everyone that API can do all the

386
00:19:42,150 --> 00:19:44,730
authorization right now you can do

387
00:19:44,730 --> 00:19:47,670
custom authorizations with your own

388
00:19:47,670 --> 00:19:48,960
language that you're familiar with or

389
00:19:48,960 --> 00:19:54,960
you can use of the authorization model

390
00:19:54,960 --> 00:19:57,570
is externalize your ability testing

391
00:19:57,570 --> 00:20:10,700
about 30 million which is

392
00:20:26,580 --> 00:20:31,000
that's the highlights of you you have

393
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:33,780
the continually from this would be is

394
00:20:33,780 --> 00:20:36,370
that's externalized oscillation

395
00:20:36,370 --> 00:20:40,780
difficulties keep it outside of it so

396
00:20:40,780 --> 00:20:42,970
that we the policies can change without

397
00:20:42,970 --> 00:20:48,700
having to rewrite their food and if you

398
00:20:48,700 --> 00:20:56,890
can so whatever you want to calculate

399
00:20:56,890 --> 00:21:04,090
the cost and the thing is when you have

400
00:21:04,090 --> 00:21:05,620
an extra nice for if you want to know

401
00:21:05,620 --> 00:21:07,900
who is about to lose tonight because

402
00:21:07,900 --> 00:21:09,580
that is the security matrix for your

403
00:21:09,580 --> 00:21:19,000
security operation see you can and if

404
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:22,030
you establish your pattern for something

405
00:21:22,030 --> 00:21:24,640
that you're building and also if you

406
00:21:24,640 --> 00:21:26,080
start asking the same question from the

407
00:21:26,080 --> 00:21:26,950
vendor that you're buying

408
00:21:26,950 --> 00:21:30,910
then the from the comfort of your

409
00:21:30,910 --> 00:21:32,920
amplifier usually your authorization

410
00:21:32,920 --> 00:21:35,980
looks the same no matter that it's from

411
00:21:35,980 --> 00:21:42,179
your product or 35 did you buy the the

412
00:21:42,179 --> 00:21:45,490
authorization and haha is relatively new

413
00:21:45,490 --> 00:21:48,880
refrain I am saying encryption without

414
00:21:48,880 --> 00:21:49,870
authorization is

415
00:21:49,870 --> 00:21:55,270
if you have a panini press release

416
00:21:55,270 --> 00:21:58,360
encryption products if this need to be

417
00:21:58,360 --> 00:22:00,970
encrypted if you're not doing

418
00:22:00,970 --> 00:22:03,400
authorization we we built it out

419
00:22:03,400 --> 00:22:05,290
so encryption is our physical universe

420
00:22:05,290 --> 00:22:08,190
so same thing an authorization without

421
00:22:08,190 --> 00:22:10,809
strong identity so multiplication is

422
00:22:10,809 --> 00:22:13,990
also good meaningless if everybody with

423
00:22:13,990 --> 00:22:15,910
the same username and password it

424
00:22:15,910 --> 00:22:18,670
doesn't make any sense as we go into the

425
00:22:18,670 --> 00:22:22,179
server's Hilary's deployments you want

426
00:22:22,179 --> 00:22:24,370
to look at how do you get identities

427
00:22:24,370 --> 00:22:27,040
however others your service is

428
00:22:27,040 --> 00:22:29,200
authenticated so one thing to look at is

429
00:22:29,200 --> 00:22:31,210
speaking expire at the same time as

430
00:22:31,210 --> 00:22:35,100
they're both or the combination

431
00:22:41,050 --> 00:22:48,930
[Applause]

432
00:22:56,760 --> 00:22:59,280
actually morning's was based on Zach

433
00:22:59,280 --> 00:23:07,380
before the stitching since I guess Sudan

434
00:23:07,380 --> 00:23:20,100
was referring this actually Maddox dr.

435
00:23:20,100 --> 00:23:27,060
Lee de Verde 1900 experts Zach mal was

436
00:23:27,060 --> 00:23:30,900
the y-axis standard for access the

437
00:23:30,900 --> 00:23:33,660
approach was that we define an XML

438
00:23:33,660 --> 00:23:37,200
schema and you have the policy is

439
00:23:37,200 --> 00:23:39,480
defined in XML and every policy

440
00:23:39,480 --> 00:23:41,310
enforcement points that every of the

441
00:23:41,310 --> 00:23:44,070
kitchen or API service they would

442
00:23:44,070 --> 00:23:46,620
understand what the XML looks like and

443
00:23:46,620 --> 00:23:49,080
it would give the witness the challenge

444
00:23:49,080 --> 00:23:51,030
with our approach was there was no other

445
00:23:51,030 --> 00:23:58,740
adoption available and studying this

446
00:23:58,740 --> 00:24:01,890
product and it was very hot for it was

447
00:24:01,890 --> 00:24:03,810
security central as a security person we

448
00:24:03,810 --> 00:24:05,190
can understand where it is it is for the

449
00:24:05,190 --> 00:24:09,260
time developers typically have Angela

450
00:24:09,260 --> 00:24:12,480
what these things are not on fighting in

451
00:24:12,480 --> 00:24:15,120
business sir a I was down the per the

452
00:24:15,120 --> 00:24:20,330
time moving a semester so that I can

453
00:24:22,280 --> 00:24:25,920
yeah so get the nothing to blame the

454
00:24:25,920 --> 00:24:27,510
productivity I've never used a

455
00:24:27,510 --> 00:24:30,240
commercial product but the standards it

456
00:24:30,240 --> 00:24:31,890
would be drawn to that much higher but I

457
00:24:31,890 --> 00:24:34,680
believe they have the similar version of

458
00:24:34,680 --> 00:24:38,460
it increasingly they have a similar team

459
00:24:38,460 --> 00:24:42,390
as all the policy agent right now to do

460
00:24:42,390 --> 00:24:44,670
the same thing it's not use examples and

461
00:24:44,670 --> 00:24:46,590
because they were trying to push it with

462
00:24:46,590 --> 00:24:49,490
the Standards Committee

463
00:24:52,640 --> 00:24:53,860
[Applause]

464
00:24:53,860 --> 00:24:59,960
yeah mom so you spoke about moving the

465
00:24:59,960 --> 00:25:03,620
authorization to an external service or

466
00:25:03,620 --> 00:25:06,350
an external party code base so once that

467
00:25:06,350 --> 00:25:08,990
happens up what are your guidelines for

468
00:25:08,990 --> 00:25:11,179
making sure - there's no test coverage

469
00:25:11,179 --> 00:25:13,400
because once you remove the

470
00:25:13,400 --> 00:25:17,679
authorization from the quarries itself

471
00:25:18,940 --> 00:25:22,820
soon the decisions API from Moulton

472
00:25:22,820 --> 00:25:24,770
policy in this case gives you the

473
00:25:24,770 --> 00:25:26,720
current range of bicha patterns are

474
00:25:26,720 --> 00:25:29,000
getting so if you return your you can

475
00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:30,679
take multiple unit test piece of if you

476
00:25:30,679 --> 00:25:32,179
have five different and a lot of

477
00:25:32,179 --> 00:25:34,370
conditions and denied conditions you can

478
00:25:34,370 --> 00:25:36,110
make sure that every endpoint versus if

479
00:25:36,110 --> 00:25:38,540
you have 1080 I am pointing to run for

480
00:25:38,540 --> 00:25:40,250
your test cases look at the decision bar

481
00:25:40,250 --> 00:25:42,440
and they say did all this ten goes to

482
00:25:42,440 --> 00:25:44,480
the condition and then I can s and

483
00:25:44,480 --> 00:25:47,270
became goes with the misuse piece just

484
00:25:47,270 --> 00:26:13,100
pieces yes the pressure in wrong and you

485
00:26:13,100 --> 00:26:15,440
you want me to the policies are deployed

486
00:26:15,440 --> 00:26:16,420
in that control

487
00:26:16,420 --> 00:26:19,090
and once it's deployed you want to be

488
00:26:19,090 --> 00:26:23,020
about monitoring for the right business

489
00:26:23,020 --> 00:26:25,570
about taxes is accessing that source are

490
00:26:25,570 --> 00:26:28,180
working if you design in such a way that

491
00:26:28,180 --> 00:26:30,880
this problem is the same as a policy on

492
00:26:30,880 --> 00:26:35,740
Hardware you use 70 decision locks this

493
00:26:35,740 --> 00:26:37,420
quantum yield monitoring this and your

494
00:26:37,420 --> 00:26:39,880
secure history panel control how many

495
00:26:39,880 --> 00:26:41,590
hours I'm getting are you getting a

496
00:26:41,590 --> 00:26:42,850
strong member of the Knights

497
00:26:42,850 --> 00:26:48,030
those are your indicators thank you

498
00:27:07,280 --> 00:27:10,339
[Music]

499
00:27:28,700 --> 00:27:44,870
is this possible and also wad well

500
00:27:44,870 --> 00:27:50,960
something it was initially written for

501
00:27:50,960 --> 00:27:53,960
end-user customers were freezing

502
00:27:53,960 --> 00:27:57,210
you're actually granting access using

503
00:27:57,210 --> 00:28:00,990
the love my name and notice if you share

504
00:28:00,990 --> 00:28:04,860
that type of thing what people started

505
00:28:04,860 --> 00:28:06,770
doing it was I start exposing this

506
00:28:06,770 --> 00:28:08,929
by two spaces so now when you're

507
00:28:08,929 --> 00:28:12,110
building and revised me to be used when

508
00:28:12,110 --> 00:28:13,730
you go to the penal system you don't

509
00:28:13,730 --> 00:28:16,400
crack accessing yes I want my kid all to

510
00:28:16,400 --> 00:28:19,460
go to this back baby business because

511
00:28:19,460 --> 00:28:22,190
it's your contract your company on the

512
00:28:22,190 --> 00:28:25,850
table as people start exposing anybody

513
00:28:25,850 --> 00:28:30,830
actually that the dog authorization

514
00:28:30,830 --> 00:28:34,640
model the number of the scope treat the

515
00:28:34,640 --> 00:28:36,590
number of scopes increases now if you

516
00:28:36,590 --> 00:28:38,929
are a developer trying to write

517
00:28:38,929 --> 00:28:40,850
something against a particular API or if

518
00:28:40,850 --> 00:28:43,340
you're a developer exposing the API and

519
00:28:43,340 --> 00:28:45,500
giving us further control you have to

520
00:28:45,500 --> 00:28:47,360
tell them where elevation is course

521
00:28:47,360 --> 00:28:49,520
available and you have been turning map

522
00:28:49,520 --> 00:28:54,730
or the scope means to research and so

523
00:28:54,730 --> 00:28:56,840
that's going to be a pawn in this game

524
00:28:56,840 --> 00:28:58,370
where you can do the kind of leverage

525
00:28:58,370 --> 00:29:00,290
you can still work through it already

526
00:29:00,290 --> 00:29:02,750
connect fool and get a sharp-looking

527
00:29:02,750 --> 00:29:05,260
and you can pass the token to

528
00:29:05,260 --> 00:29:07,850
authorization for this year and then say

529
00:29:07,850 --> 00:29:11,330
is this about a journey so now if you

530
00:29:11,330 --> 00:29:14,750
are experimenting this so you have the

531
00:29:14,750 --> 00:29:19,330
same semantics of which

532
00:29:20,690 --> 00:29:22,820
the particular user and roll track

533
00:29:22,820 --> 00:29:25,099
seducers you can you give the customers

534
00:29:25,099 --> 00:29:27,019
a complete control ethical is an

535
00:29:27,019 --> 00:29:29,179
endpoint and you can configure and they

536
00:29:29,179 --> 00:29:31,429
can start up a service they can and for

537
00:29:31,429 --> 00:29:32,690
longer routes they don't have to

538
00:29:32,690 --> 00:29:36,169
understand your meaning of the disco

539
00:29:36,169 --> 00:29:38,570
pass the budget resources instead they

540
00:29:38,570 --> 00:29:40,009
can say okay these are another candy

541
00:29:40,009 --> 00:29:42,590
cane partner if you would let me figure

542
00:29:42,590 --> 00:29:45,139
out who can access the API and I will

543
00:29:45,139 --> 00:29:48,259
start at 0.1 but the third factor

544
00:29:48,259 --> 00:29:55,779
changes to the service but it's

545
00:30:21,669 --> 00:30:29,359
information damages the application it's

546
00:30:29,359 --> 00:30:32,560
kind of answering

547
00:30:32,560 --> 00:30:35,120
the application first receives the

548
00:30:35,120 --> 00:30:38,510
request it's receiving to the train user

549
00:30:38,510 --> 00:30:40,820
with the obligation that problem is the

550
00:30:40,820 --> 00:30:44,470
same the you know hardware your end user

551
00:30:44,470 --> 00:30:46,880
goes through already tonight type of

552
00:30:46,880 --> 00:30:48,620
goal you have a chart or individual

553
00:30:48,620 --> 00:30:50,930
right now you're making the rest 58

554
00:30:50,930 --> 00:30:52,580
cause you're passing the doctor up in

555
00:30:52,580 --> 00:30:53,780
the header

556
00:30:53,780 --> 00:30:56,750
now the rest api ability remote

557
00:30:56,750 --> 00:30:59,480
investigate you have the either the jaw

558
00:30:59,480 --> 00:31:02,810
broken or any other semantics is mutual

559
00:31:02,810 --> 00:31:04,370
killed as your certificate information

560
00:31:04,370 --> 00:31:06,740
you have those information available of

561
00:31:06,740 --> 00:31:09,770
the head and your filter basically

562
00:31:09,770 --> 00:31:11,990
grasses information and the puzzles are

563
00:31:11,990 --> 00:31:14,060
all are dancing getting the information

564
00:31:14,060 --> 00:31:16,910
available either the token are the

565
00:31:16,910 --> 00:31:19,730
actual user and and then it's up to the

566
00:31:19,730 --> 00:31:23,980
policy you write to say that you want
