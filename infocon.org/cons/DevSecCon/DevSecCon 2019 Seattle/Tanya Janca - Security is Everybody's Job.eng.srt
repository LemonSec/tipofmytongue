do you agree no he's like no don't do

12
00:00:46,200 --> 00:00:49,829
that we're fiddling around with it and

13
00:00:49,829 --> 00:00:51,270
you wanted me to keep it open the whole

14
00:00:51,270 --> 00:00:52,920
time so I had to walk away from my

15
00:00:52,920 --> 00:00:58,260
laptop with it unlocked right so you all

16
00:00:58,260 --> 00:01:01,609
know and it was so it would work but

17
00:01:01,609 --> 00:01:08,430
don't worry we got this except for I

18
00:01:08,430 --> 00:01:09,689
don't want it like that I want it to be

19
00:01:09,689 --> 00:01:17,360
like this Chris I'm gonna fiddle with it

20
00:01:18,890 --> 00:01:21,180
okay well you fiddle with my laptop and

21
00:01:21,180 --> 00:01:24,990
I'm gonna talk to everyone so who here

22
00:01:24,990 --> 00:01:29,220
works in IT somewhere yeah okay who here

23
00:01:29,220 --> 00:01:35,299
does ops okay who here is a developer

24
00:01:35,299 --> 00:01:38,729
okay who here might not be a developer

25
00:01:38,729 --> 00:01:41,329
but writes code is part of their job

26
00:01:41,329 --> 00:01:44,130
okay who here does support as part of

27
00:01:44,130 --> 00:01:48,270
their job who here does security as part

28
00:01:48,270 --> 00:01:51,500
of their job every hand every hand

29
00:01:51,500 --> 00:01:54,060
by the end of this talk I expect all of

30
00:01:54,060 --> 00:01:55,439
your hands to go up because I am not

31
00:01:55,439 --> 00:01:56,850
kidding when I say security is actually

32
00:01:56,850 --> 00:02:02,299
everybody's job he's gonna do some stuff

33
00:02:02,299 --> 00:02:04,590
but what I'm gonna talk about today is

34
00:02:04,590 --> 00:02:06,840
basically I'm gonna start with what is

35
00:02:06,840 --> 00:02:08,669
AB SEC just so we're all on the same

36
00:02:08,669 --> 00:02:11,280
page because I have some opinions then

37
00:02:11,280 --> 00:02:12,540
we're going to talk about what I feel

38
00:02:12,540 --> 00:02:14,520
that SEC OPS's cuz a lot of people are

39
00:02:14,520 --> 00:02:16,650
like no devs dipsticks opps isn't a

40
00:02:16,650 --> 00:02:18,000
thing you're just supposed to do devops

41
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:19,920
properly and then it should be secure

42
00:02:19,920 --> 00:02:22,709
and I promise the moment that everyone

43
00:02:22,709 --> 00:02:25,200
doing DevOps releases secure apps every

44
00:02:25,200 --> 00:02:27,690
time I will shut up and stop saying dev

45
00:02:27,690 --> 00:02:29,489
set-offs but until then I feel like we

46
00:02:29,489 --> 00:02:31,319
still need to say that it is a thing and

47
00:02:31,319 --> 00:02:33,630
it's important after that I'm going to

48
00:02:33,630 --> 00:02:35,040
talk about what the three ways are of

49
00:02:35,040 --> 00:02:36,690
DevOps because everyone seems to have a

50
00:02:36,690 --> 00:02:38,519
different definition and then I'm gonna

51
00:02:38,519 --> 00:02:40,019
talk just basically the whole rest of

52
00:02:40,019 --> 00:02:41,940
the talk of just examples of how we can

53
00:02:41,940 --> 00:02:44,940
weave security into DevOps to every

54
00:02:44,940 --> 00:02:47,910
single part of the way I have like a

55
00:02:47,910 --> 00:02:49,500
bunch of interesting ideas I'm gonna

56
00:02:49,500 --> 00:02:50,670
quote a bunch of the other speakers

57
00:02:50,670 --> 00:02:54,030
because well that's where I learned a

58
00:02:54,030 --> 00:02:56,190
lot of this stuff who here's been to Def

59
00:02:56,190 --> 00:03:02,400
Con before I've been a few times so I'm

60
00:03:02,400 --> 00:03:03,660
tempted to ask how you heard about it

61
00:03:03,660 --> 00:03:05,160
but then no one's gonna talk and it's

62
00:03:05,160 --> 00:03:08,820
gonna be awkward but anyway we totally

63
00:03:08,820 --> 00:03:11,609
had this working early I I swear I got

64
00:03:11,609 --> 00:03:13,590
here really early and obsessively

65
00:03:13,590 --> 00:03:15,750
checked because I don't know if you know

66
00:03:15,750 --> 00:03:18,480
but when you speak at conferences this

67
00:03:18,480 --> 00:03:21,299
is the most most nerve-wracking part

68
00:03:21,299 --> 00:03:23,250
like as soon as the things are so I'm

69
00:03:23,250 --> 00:03:24,359
like everything will be fine

70
00:03:24,359 --> 00:03:26,010
I'm never worried about like scary

71
00:03:26,010 --> 00:03:28,380
questions or anyone being mean I'm like

72
00:03:28,380 --> 00:03:29,609
everyone here is gonna have a good time

73
00:03:29,609 --> 00:03:31,680
it's gonna be great I'm just like gosh I

74
00:03:31,680 --> 00:03:38,690
hope my laptop works so part of my thing

75
00:03:38,690 --> 00:03:40,980
when I do a talk as if you ask a

76
00:03:40,980 --> 00:03:42,239
question or you participate you get a

77
00:03:42,239 --> 00:03:44,160
candy so who here has ever been to

78
00:03:44,160 --> 00:03:47,340
Canada before okay good job good job the

79
00:03:47,340 --> 00:03:50,370
rest of you let me know so in Canada

80
00:03:50,370 --> 00:03:51,630
we're big into this thing called maple

81
00:03:51,630 --> 00:03:53,400
syrup so the maple tree you know like

82
00:03:53,400 --> 00:03:54,930
that leaf on our flag we're very excited

83
00:03:54,930 --> 00:03:57,720
about it and they basically they leak

84
00:03:57,720 --> 00:04:00,209
sugar and so we take the sugar we boil

85
00:04:00,209 --> 00:04:02,250
it down and it makes maple syrup and so

86
00:04:02,250 --> 00:04:03,930
I brought maple candies so oh they are

87
00:04:03,930 --> 00:04:04,560
made of is

88
00:04:04,560 --> 00:04:07,470
tree sap if you ask a question you get a

89
00:04:07,470 --> 00:04:09,900
candy now I'm not kidding I'm like a

90
00:04:09,900 --> 00:04:11,340
kindergarten teacher just waiting to

91
00:04:11,340 --> 00:04:14,790
happen so I hope that that helps you'll

92
00:04:14,790 --> 00:04:17,040
be a little bit less shy for this talk

93
00:04:17,040 --> 00:04:19,440
but for all the talks participation is

94
00:04:19,440 --> 00:04:21,690
key for me I question period is where

95
00:04:21,690 --> 00:04:24,419
you can teach me things that are new is

96
00:04:24,419 --> 00:04:26,970
sometimes I don't understand things that

97
00:04:26,970 --> 00:04:29,310
like you have like a specific situation

98
00:04:29,310 --> 00:04:31,380
I've never heard of before and I can

99
00:04:31,380 --> 00:04:33,150
learn something new sometimes you ask a

100
00:04:33,150 --> 00:04:35,010
question am i great so apparently I

101
00:04:35,010 --> 00:04:36,540
didn't explain that clearly at all like

102
00:04:36,540 --> 00:04:38,460
I need to update my sides or like change

103
00:04:38,460 --> 00:04:39,750
the way I'm explaining things so it's

104
00:04:39,750 --> 00:04:43,440
more clear and I'm ridiculously

105
00:04:43,440 --> 00:04:45,860
extroverted so for the entire conference

106
00:04:45,860 --> 00:04:48,540
please come say hi if you want to like

107
00:04:48,540 --> 00:04:50,250
you don't have to but I really like to

108
00:04:50,250 --> 00:04:58,220
talk so I'm really friendly I'm nice and

109
00:04:58,220 --> 00:05:00,870
so I kind of wanted to do like presenter

110
00:05:00,870 --> 00:05:04,669
view so I can see my my notes

111
00:05:08,090 --> 00:05:10,740
it looks like it's seeing stuff did you

112
00:05:10,740 --> 00:05:12,210
try unplugging and plugging it back in

113
00:05:12,210 --> 00:05:17,430
again I have I have another adapter

114
00:05:17,430 --> 00:05:18,660
because that adapters sometimes

115
00:05:18,660 --> 00:05:22,350
misbehaves like it did in earlier but

116
00:05:22,350 --> 00:05:26,240
sometimes you want try the brand-new one

117
00:05:29,270 --> 00:05:33,720
really I love PowerPoint has anyone used

118
00:05:33,720 --> 00:05:35,639
things that are PowerPoint because I

119
00:05:35,639 --> 00:05:39,410
have and then I bought powerpoints I

120
00:05:39,410 --> 00:05:43,919
know I'm biased because you know but I

121
00:05:43,919 --> 00:05:46,289
bought it before I worked there I paid

122
00:05:46,289 --> 00:05:51,150
for my copy of Microsoft Office but my

123
00:05:51,150 --> 00:05:52,740
boss told me he'd give me a free one if

124
00:05:52,740 --> 00:05:53,340
I wanted

125
00:05:53,340 --> 00:05:56,810
[Laughter]

126
00:05:56,810 --> 00:05:58,860
fingers crossed all right

127
00:05:58,860 --> 00:06:04,590
let's hope you're wet

128
00:06:04,590 --> 00:06:08,010
I didn't hear that but it looked really

129
00:06:08,010 --> 00:06:23,190
positive I promised him I wouldn't jump

130
00:06:23,190 --> 00:06:26,730
up it down already broken

131
00:06:26,730 --> 00:06:30,960

133
00:06:33,300 --> 00:06:35,040

134
00:06:35,040 --> 00:06:37,440
I mean that wait wait wait let's turn

135
00:06:37,440 --> 00:06:38,820

kidding I mean it so let's talk so where

138
00:06:46,290 --> 00:06:47,760
are we going to talk about today we are

139
00:06:47,760 --> 00:06:50,970
going to talk about DevOps what I mean

140
00:06:50,970 --> 00:06:52,830
by def sec ops and then we're going to

141
00:06:52,830 --> 00:06:54,810
talk about how you can make security a

142
00:06:54,810 --> 00:06:58,020
part of your daily work and not go crazy

143
00:06:58,020 --> 00:07:02,790
not be not feel like it's like this big

144
00:07:02,790 --> 00:07:05,340
huge extra thing I want security to seem

145
00:07:05,340 --> 00:07:07,290
like it's doable and possible and it

146
00:07:07,290 --> 00:07:10,320
really is okay who here seen the slide

147
00:07:10,320 --> 00:07:15,000
before some security people feel you

148
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:16,880
know DevOps is this amazing wonderful

149
00:07:16,880 --> 00:07:19,620
unicorn that's so amazing at poops

150
00:07:19,620 --> 00:07:21,060
rainbows and that we clean up the mess

151
00:07:21,060 --> 00:07:23,160
but that's not how I view it so when I

152
00:07:23,160 --> 00:07:25,560
met Francois he made this slide this is

153
00:07:25,560 --> 00:07:28,200
how he and I and I hope by the end of

154
00:07:28,200 --> 00:07:30,600
this conference you see DevOps it's it's

155
00:07:30,600 --> 00:07:35,389
security enabling teaching helping

156
00:07:35,389 --> 00:07:38,820

157
00:07:38,820 --> 00:07:41,610

165
00:08:00,780 --> 00:08:03,389
advocate or a developer avocado as some

166
00:08:03,389 --> 00:08:05,830
of us call it

167
00:08:05,830 --> 00:08:08,440
I'm totally obsessed with a wasp I talk

168
00:08:08,440 --> 00:08:09,970
about all husband like every single talk

169
00:08:09,970 --> 00:08:11,889
even if it doesn't always relate because

170
00:08:11,889 --> 00:08:14,590
I'm a huge huge fan I'm one of the

171
00:08:14,590 --> 00:08:16,270
founders of something called whoa sec so

172
00:08:16,270 --> 00:08:17,080
if you are a woman

173
00:08:17,080 --> 00:08:18,820
we're opening a chapter in Seattle

174
00:08:18,820 --> 00:08:20,350
really soon and it's basically a place

175
00:08:20,350 --> 00:08:22,660
for you to come meet lots of friends who

176
00:08:22,660 --> 00:08:26,770
are women that work in security and I am

177
00:08:26,770 --> 00:08:28,990
one of the project leaders for an OS

178
00:08:28,990 --> 00:08:31,900
project of course called devlop sloppy

179
00:08:31,900 --> 00:08:34,929
DevOps that's us okay so let's learn

180
00:08:34,929 --> 00:08:37,360
stuff um okay so first I want to do a

181
00:08:37,360 --> 00:08:39,909
couple just a couple definitions and I

182
00:08:39,909 --> 00:08:41,110
know you're all like I'm an expert in

183
00:08:41,110 --> 00:08:43,150
that I already know this but not every

184
00:08:43,150 --> 00:08:44,680
single person in the audience is so this

185
00:08:44,680 --> 00:08:46,720
will be like two minutes and it won't

186
00:08:46,720 --> 00:08:50,890
hurt okay so what is AB sec anything

187
00:08:50,890 --> 00:08:52,870
that you do to make your software more

188
00:08:52,870 --> 00:08:56,200
secure is how I define app sec so I said

189
00:08:56,200 --> 00:08:57,550
that because I couldn't find someone

190
00:08:57,550 --> 00:09:00,730
else to say it but if you were doing

191
00:09:00,730 --> 00:09:02,740
like a code review and looking for

192
00:09:02,740 --> 00:09:04,420
security book specifically and you have

193
00:09:04,420 --> 00:09:06,160
like this formal process that's app sec

194
00:09:06,160 --> 00:09:08,260
but if you are grepping through your

195
00:09:08,260 --> 00:09:10,150
source control like all through your

196
00:09:10,150 --> 00:09:12,100
cool library looking for like something

197
00:09:12,100 --> 00:09:13,270
that you've just found out like oh that

198
00:09:13,270 --> 00:09:14,620
functions really insecure we need to

199
00:09:14,620 --> 00:09:16,060
like update and use this other one

200
00:09:16,060 --> 00:09:17,980
that's app sec it doesn't have to be

201
00:09:17,980 --> 00:09:20,530
super formal it just has to have the

202
00:09:20,530 --> 00:09:22,300
purpose of trying to make your software

203
00:09:22,300 --> 00:09:25,390
more secure okay so why do I want to

204
00:09:25,390 --> 00:09:26,980
talk about app sec so app sec

205
00:09:26,980 --> 00:09:29,320
unfortunately is the number one reason

206
00:09:29,320 --> 00:09:31,540
for data breaches the past three years

207
00:09:31,540 --> 00:09:33,760
we are the winner according to the

208
00:09:33,760 --> 00:09:35,440
Verizon breach report I want to not win

209
00:09:35,440 --> 00:09:40,960
this Nobel Prize anymore and you can see

210
00:09:40,960 --> 00:09:42,940
like 29 to 40 percent of breaches like

211
00:09:42,940 --> 00:09:46,360
each year is 29 to 40 percent of your

212
00:09:46,360 --> 00:09:47,860
security budget going towards making

213
00:09:47,860 --> 00:09:49,210
your software secure because I bet it's

214
00:09:49,210 --> 00:09:52,870
not right um okay so another thing is

215
00:09:52,870 --> 00:09:54,780
that we're not really teaching in school

216
00:09:54,780 --> 00:09:57,339
like who here took computer science or

217
00:09:57,339 --> 00:10:00,070
soft edge or something in school okay so

218
00:10:00,070 --> 00:10:01,960
how many of you feel you got taught how

219
00:10:01,960 --> 00:10:04,450
to make secure software in school okay

220
00:10:04,450 --> 00:10:06,690
one hand definitely I want to talk after

221
00:10:06,690 --> 00:10:10,000
and you okay awesome thank you I'm so

222
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:11,440
glad because usually I've never seen a

223
00:10:11,440 --> 00:10:14,200
hand before yes getting better okay so

224
00:10:14,200 --> 00:10:15,700
another reason is that Security's

225
00:10:15,700 --> 00:10:16,980
outnumbered do you see how lonely

226
00:10:16,980 --> 00:10:18,060
she looks she's a little sad the

227
00:10:18,060 --> 00:10:19,680
datacentre by yourself that's me being

228
00:10:19,680 --> 00:10:22,380
security so this is the numbers

229
00:10:22,380 --> 00:10:25,230
apparently for every hundred developers

230
00:10:25,230 --> 00:10:27,149
are ten people doing ops and there's one

231
00:10:27,149 --> 00:10:29,940
doing security and I've worked places

232
00:10:29,940 --> 00:10:30,990
where there's like two thousand

233
00:10:30,990 --> 00:10:34,949
developers and I am the app SEC team am

234
00:10:34,949 --> 00:10:36,660
i doing like a glass of water and

235
00:10:36,660 --> 00:10:38,310
someone has a fire hose and they're

236
00:10:38,310 --> 00:10:40,079
aiming it at it and then you go away for

237
00:10:40,079 --> 00:10:42,120
a few months and you come back and

238
00:10:42,120 --> 00:10:44,250
that's what my inbox looked like every

239
00:10:44,250 --> 00:10:48,449
day and this is an image my friend made

240
00:10:48,449 --> 00:10:50,670
me it's dinosaurs frolicking and a

241
00:10:50,670 --> 00:10:56,430
waterfall is its old I found like

242
00:10:56,430 --> 00:10:58,230
developing code and waterfall didn't

243
00:10:58,230 --> 00:10:59,850
always work but that the security model

244
00:10:59,850 --> 00:11:02,250
was just brutal like stop just like code

245
00:11:02,250 --> 00:11:03,540
freeze for a few weeks while we do a

246
00:11:03,540 --> 00:11:06,209
code review no we'll just continue to

247
00:11:06,209 --> 00:11:09,120
release code and ignore you things okay

248
00:11:09,120 --> 00:11:11,310
so let's talk about what DevOps is so I

249
00:11:11,310 --> 00:11:13,860
want to talk about the business goals

250
00:11:13,860 --> 00:11:15,600
for DevOps and then I'm going to talk

251
00:11:15,600 --> 00:11:18,089
about like our view as the tech people

252
00:11:18,089 --> 00:11:21,120
of DevOps so main goals you know we want

253
00:11:21,120 --> 00:11:23,279
to get to market faster we want to have

254
00:11:23,279 --> 00:11:25,199
better resilience and we want to be able

255
00:11:25,199 --> 00:11:27,060
to like release fixes faster are you

256
00:11:27,060 --> 00:11:29,220
like those are the main goals we want we

257
00:11:29,220 --> 00:11:30,540
want to make the money and have an

258
00:11:30,540 --> 00:11:33,990
awesome product right okay so I believe

259
00:11:33,990 --> 00:11:36,630
that these goals intersect very nicely

260
00:11:36,630 --> 00:11:38,490
with Security's goals so I'm gonna

261
00:11:38,490 --> 00:11:41,040
briefly let's talk about that so if you

262
00:11:41,040 --> 00:11:43,139
can improve to improve deployment

263
00:11:43,139 --> 00:11:45,209
frequency so it's happening you know all

264
00:11:45,209 --> 00:11:46,769
the time like three times a day instead

265
00:11:46,769 --> 00:11:49,260
of three times a year that means if I

266
00:11:49,260 --> 00:11:51,060
find a security vulnerability you can

267
00:11:51,060 --> 00:11:53,610
fix it for me now I worked somewhere

268
00:11:53,610 --> 00:11:56,990
once an hour release cycle was 16 months

269
00:11:56,990 --> 00:12:01,680
our emergency release cycle when I found

270
00:12:01,680 --> 00:12:07,050
something nasty was four months mmm okay

271
00:12:07,050 --> 00:12:09,199
so the next thing is lower failure rates

272
00:12:09,199 --> 00:12:12,510
some people call this resiliency who

273
00:12:12,510 --> 00:12:14,910
here has seen this before the CIA triad

274
00:12:14,910 --> 00:12:18,389
yes this is the mandate of security it

275
00:12:18,389 --> 00:12:20,459
is our job like this is why we get paid

276
00:12:20,459 --> 00:12:22,709
to protect the confidentiality the

277
00:12:22,709 --> 00:12:25,529
integrity the availability of the

278
00:12:25,529 --> 00:12:28,320
systems that you create

279
00:12:28,320 --> 00:12:30,150
and the data in those systems like

280
00:12:30,150 --> 00:12:32,190
that's that's our job if those are in

281
00:12:32,190 --> 00:12:33,330
line we get paid

282
00:12:33,330 --> 00:12:37,200
no one gets fired life is good so when

283
00:12:37,200 --> 00:12:38,610
we look at resiliency and then we look

284
00:12:38,610 --> 00:12:40,260
at the CI a see how availability

285
00:12:40,260 --> 00:12:42,890
slightly bigger if it's always available

286
00:12:42,890 --> 00:12:45,540
then Security's happy and if it's

287
00:12:45,540 --> 00:12:46,890
resilient it's likely to always be

288
00:12:46,890 --> 00:12:48,450
available so this is great

289
00:12:48,450 --> 00:12:50,070
okay so security team totally on board

290
00:12:50,070 --> 00:12:51,570
for the goals so what about the last

291
00:12:51,570 --> 00:12:54,390
goal faster time-to-market why is this

292
00:12:54,390 --> 00:12:56,910
security team care about this because

293
00:12:56,910 --> 00:12:58,320
there's no security team if there's no

294
00:12:58,320 --> 00:13:02,760
business we don't win if the business

295
00:13:02,760 --> 00:13:05,310
doesn't win right it's our job to enable

296
00:13:05,310 --> 00:13:07,230
everyone in the business to get whatever

297
00:13:07,230 --> 00:13:09,120
they're done whatever they need to get

298
00:13:09,120 --> 00:13:12,750
done doing securely that's our job so if

299
00:13:12,750 --> 00:13:15,000
we are the ones in the way of them

300
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:15,870
getting the work done

301
00:13:15,870 --> 00:13:19,550
we are the threat okay

302
00:13:19,550 --> 00:13:22,080
so there's another thing that I said I

303
00:13:22,080 --> 00:13:24,270
feel so I'm obsessed with Oh Aspen

304
00:13:24,270 --> 00:13:26,640
considering how obsessed I am me thing

305
00:13:26,640 --> 00:13:28,440
DevOps is the best thing to happen to

306
00:13:28,440 --> 00:13:31,050
apps tech since OHA's is the highest

307
00:13:31,050 --> 00:13:33,090
compliment I can pay I really believe

308
00:13:33,090 --> 00:13:35,790
that if we're going to do IT right then

309
00:13:35,790 --> 00:13:37,140
we have a really good chance of doing

310
00:13:37,140 --> 00:13:41,760
security right so DevOps and the three

311
00:13:41,760 --> 00:13:44,130
ways I know there are several different

312
00:13:44,130 --> 00:13:47,310
definitions of what DevOps is so I'm

313
00:13:47,310 --> 00:13:49,230
gonna give you my definition and by my

314
00:13:49,230 --> 00:13:49,890
definition

315
00:13:49,890 --> 00:13:51,600
I mean I've memorized the DevOps

316
00:13:51,600 --> 00:13:53,610
handbook I read the Phoenix project and

317
00:13:53,610 --> 00:13:55,860
accelerate I love all of those books and

318
00:13:55,860 --> 00:13:58,230
I feel you should all read them too but

319
00:13:58,230 --> 00:13:59,730
basically you can't have to have ops

320
00:13:59,730 --> 00:14:02,430
unless you have the three ways so the

321
00:14:02,430 --> 00:14:04,560
first way is we need to emphasize the

322
00:14:04,560 --> 00:14:06,600
speed of the entire system so I can't

323
00:14:06,600 --> 00:14:08,340
just work really hard to get my part to

324
00:14:08,340 --> 00:14:10,500
go faster if everything still takes just

325
00:14:10,500 --> 00:14:12,450
as long right instead I should work with

326
00:14:12,450 --> 00:14:14,040
another team because theirs is a rope

327
00:14:14,040 --> 00:14:17,340
Walker right so you want speed the next

328
00:14:17,340 --> 00:14:19,260
thing is you want feedback I want to

329
00:14:19,260 --> 00:14:21,180
know right away I want to feel fast if

330
00:14:21,180 --> 00:14:22,830
I'm gonna fail please let me fail in a

331
00:14:22,830 --> 00:14:26,430
week not a year right and then the third

332
00:14:26,430 --> 00:14:29,760
way is continuous learning you can't

333
00:14:29,760 --> 00:14:31,410
really go very far if you don't learn

334
00:14:31,410 --> 00:14:33,930
who here has has worked somewhere where

335
00:14:33,930 --> 00:14:35,940
there's this person maybe it's you where

336
00:14:35,940 --> 00:14:37,770
they're like I can't leave for one

337
00:14:37,770 --> 00:14:38,940
minute because everything in the entire

338
00:14:38,940 --> 00:14:41,160
building will fall apart everything will

339
00:14:41,160 --> 00:14:41,710
fall with

340
00:14:41,710 --> 00:14:43,630
me yeah you need to go on training the

341
00:14:43,630 --> 00:14:45,940
most because you haven't got it in a

342
00:14:45,940 --> 00:14:47,620
long time and there might be newer more

343
00:14:47,620 --> 00:14:49,330
exciting ways and things that you can do

344
00:14:49,330 --> 00:14:51,220
that you can't do because you're

345
00:14:51,220 --> 00:14:52,480
constantly just trying to hold together

346
00:14:52,480 --> 00:14:55,410
this like crumbling system right and

347
00:14:55,410 --> 00:14:57,580
when we update things and we change

348
00:14:57,580 --> 00:14:58,990
things then all of a sudden life gets

349
00:14:58,990 --> 00:15:00,520
better and we're going to talk a little

350
00:15:00,520 --> 00:15:02,530
bit about heroics because I would like

351
00:15:02,530 --> 00:15:04,090
you to not have to do heroics Network

352
00:15:04,090 --> 00:15:09,820
everyday okay so how do we do these how

353
00:15:09,820 --> 00:15:11,560
do we emphasize the efficiency of the

354
00:15:11,560 --> 00:15:14,380
entire system and add security right so

355
00:15:14,380 --> 00:15:15,760
what I'm gonna do is just go through the

356
00:15:15,760 --> 00:15:17,050
three ways and give you a ton of ideas

357
00:15:17,050 --> 00:15:18,880
that I hope you want to take some of

358
00:15:18,880 --> 00:15:21,040
them back how's everyone doing did

359
00:15:21,040 --> 00:15:22,390
everyone have breakfast this morning

360
00:15:22,390 --> 00:15:24,240
yeah did everyone have coffee we're good

361
00:15:24,240 --> 00:15:26,440
okay cuz I'm gonna put like a lot of

362
00:15:26,440 --> 00:15:27,760
stuff in your brain and I have to go

363
00:15:27,760 --> 00:15:31,630
kind of fast so I got 40 minutes good

364
00:15:31,630 --> 00:15:32,560
caffeine's good

365
00:15:32,560 --> 00:15:35,710
okay so emphasizing the speed of the

366
00:15:35,710 --> 00:15:37,570
entire system so I call this left to

367
00:15:37,570 --> 00:15:40,180
right and here's my amazing animation I

368
00:15:40,180 --> 00:15:42,190
know right

369
00:15:42,190 --> 00:15:47,110
amazing so what this means is we need

370
00:15:47,110 --> 00:15:49,390
everything to go fast so security can't

371
00:15:49,390 --> 00:15:51,040
be a big bottleneck anymore

372
00:15:51,040 --> 00:15:52,780
who here has worked in security and felt

373
00:15:52,780 --> 00:15:54,460
sometimes like you are a bottleneck I

374
00:15:54,460 --> 00:15:56,200
definitely have unfortunately not on

375
00:15:56,200 --> 00:15:59,620
purpose I have been that person so the

376
00:15:59,620 --> 00:16:01,720
big thing for security and regards to

377
00:16:01,720 --> 00:16:04,300
making the entire system is efficient is

378
00:16:04,300 --> 00:16:07,840
we can't be a bottleneck anymore and we

379
00:16:07,840 --> 00:16:10,030
cannot break the build unless there's

380
00:16:10,030 --> 00:16:12,970
something actually bad happening right

381
00:16:12,970 --> 00:16:15,160
so we can't say oh well we're not ready

382
00:16:15,160 --> 00:16:16,810
for that so you have to go away way

383
00:16:16,810 --> 00:16:18,400
slower and stop everything you're doing

384
00:16:18,400 --> 00:16:23,080
and wait on us we should break the build

385
00:16:23,080 --> 00:16:24,760
if we find something serious though and

386
00:16:24,760 --> 00:16:26,290
a lot of developers don't like that when

387
00:16:26,290 --> 00:16:28,450
you break the build you are unpopular so

388
00:16:28,450 --> 00:16:30,580
you want to make sure that you only stop

389
00:16:30,580 --> 00:16:32,470
the pipeline for real like pull the and

390
00:16:32,470 --> 00:16:35,110
on cord on the assembly line if you

391
00:16:35,110 --> 00:16:36,430
actually actually found something

392
00:16:36,430 --> 00:16:37,990
serious so that's what it means for

393
00:16:37,990 --> 00:16:40,360
security but what does it mean for Devon

394
00:16:40,360 --> 00:16:42,010
ops how do they make this a part of

395
00:16:42,010 --> 00:16:45,310
their daily life so first of all we need

396
00:16:45,310 --> 00:16:47,410
help from all of you so as security

397
00:16:47,410 --> 00:16:49,210
people we need help from you tuning and

398
00:16:49,210 --> 00:16:51,700
installing our tools in your pipeline we

399
00:16:51,700 --> 00:16:53,130
need to actually collaborate with

400
00:16:53,130 --> 00:16:54,300
not just tell you guess what I'm gonna

401
00:16:54,300 --> 00:16:56,970
do to you I don't want to add something

402
00:16:56,970 --> 00:16:58,170
to your pipeline that takes eight hours

403
00:16:58,170 --> 00:17:00,030
because I can figure it incorrectly so I

404
00:17:00,030 --> 00:17:01,740
need feedback from you to make sure I

405
00:17:01,740 --> 00:17:04,500
don't mess things up and it also means

406
00:17:04,500 --> 00:17:07,470
that when your pipeline finds bugs that

407
00:17:07,470 --> 00:17:09,709
are serious enough to break the build

408
00:17:09,709 --> 00:17:12,150
they still have to go into your backlog

409
00:17:12,150 --> 00:17:13,530
in your bug tracker and you still have

410
00:17:13,530 --> 00:17:15,630
to fix them just it's not breaking the

411
00:17:15,630 --> 00:17:17,099
build right just because something's a

412
00:17:17,099 --> 00:17:18,720
low doesn't mean it doesn't matter

413
00:17:18,720 --> 00:17:20,730
I've worked places where they're like oh

414
00:17:20,730 --> 00:17:25,170
if it's medium we just delete those okay

415
00:17:25,170 --> 00:17:27,000
so what else does it mean it means if

416
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:29,160
you can reuse things don't reinvent the

417
00:17:29,160 --> 00:17:31,770
wheel right so if you can use code

418
00:17:31,770 --> 00:17:33,540
samples if you can have a secure coding

419
00:17:33,540 --> 00:17:35,670
library with good code samples if

420
00:17:35,670 --> 00:17:37,830
something has already been like

421
00:17:37,830 --> 00:17:40,560
contested into oblivion like reuse that

422
00:17:40,560 --> 00:17:42,990
code if you can I've worked places where

423
00:17:42,990 --> 00:17:44,640
we like create this awesome template and

424
00:17:44,640 --> 00:17:46,080
then we just test the crap out of the

425
00:17:46,080 --> 00:17:47,670
template and then we all just update

426
00:17:47,670 --> 00:17:50,310
from the template right like you'll be

427
00:17:50,310 --> 00:17:52,140
surprised how many people don't do this

428
00:17:52,140 --> 00:17:54,900
like like you know oh we have lots of

429
00:17:54,900 --> 00:17:56,070
pride you know I could do it better

430
00:17:56,070 --> 00:17:56,550
myself

431
00:17:56,550 --> 00:17:59,280
no don't do it be lazy reuse if it's

432
00:17:59,280 --> 00:18:02,250
good okay yeah and we also of course

433
00:18:02,250 --> 00:18:04,470
want to just deploy up-to-date images

434
00:18:04,470 --> 00:18:06,660
and containers you're not believe how

435
00:18:06,660 --> 00:18:07,980
many places I've worked where they have

436
00:18:07,980 --> 00:18:09,900
like the golden image for a month

437
00:18:09,900 --> 00:18:11,760
it doesn't change I'm like but patch

438
00:18:11,760 --> 00:18:13,590
Tuesdays happened so many times since

439
00:18:13,590 --> 00:18:15,900
you know the first of the month why are

440
00:18:15,900 --> 00:18:18,500
we deploying that come on okay

441
00:18:18,500 --> 00:18:20,640
throughout this talk I'm gonna have five

442
00:18:20,640 --> 00:18:24,060
photos slides I have images instead of

443
00:18:24,060 --> 00:18:25,380
words on the screen so that you listen

444
00:18:25,380 --> 00:18:27,660
to me talk because I know when I see

445
00:18:27,660 --> 00:18:30,420
words I have to read them and so if you

446
00:18:30,420 --> 00:18:32,010
like to take notes I took the notes for

447
00:18:32,010 --> 00:18:33,540
you so just take an image of his picture

448
00:18:33,540 --> 00:18:34,860
there's gonna be five of them I

449
00:18:34,860 --> 00:18:37,260
personally don't like to write things

450
00:18:37,260 --> 00:18:38,880
down and I lose them and stuff so you

451
00:18:38,880 --> 00:18:40,260
could just take a picture and I did the

452
00:18:40,260 --> 00:18:42,210
work for you so there will be five this

453
00:18:42,210 --> 00:18:44,850
is number one so this is the was this

454
00:18:44,850 --> 00:18:48,300
mean for Devon ops and just gonna give

455
00:18:48,300 --> 00:18:49,620
everyone a second with their cameras

456
00:18:49,620 --> 00:18:50,520
because I don't wanna be that person

457
00:18:50,520 --> 00:18:51,930
that asks you to take a picture and then

458
00:18:51,930 --> 00:18:57,330
it's like no too late okay everyone good

459
00:18:57,330 --> 00:19:00,980
okay next slide

460
00:19:01,260 --> 00:19:03,720
yes okay so what else does this mean for

461
00:19:03,720 --> 00:19:04,320
Devin opps

462
00:19:04,320 --> 00:19:07,560
so it means that if we create a security

463
00:19:07,560 --> 00:19:10,410
pipeline we want you to use it so

464
00:19:10,410 --> 00:19:11,580
sometimes you know like you have the

465
00:19:11,580 --> 00:19:13,170
regular pipeline that goes out and then

466
00:19:13,170 --> 00:19:14,610
publishes to this environment this

467
00:19:14,610 --> 00:19:16,950
environment this environment but maybe

468
00:19:16,950 --> 00:19:18,840
the security team will create a parallel

469
00:19:18,840 --> 00:19:20,670
security pipeline for you so it goes to

470
00:19:20,670 --> 00:19:23,070
nowhere but it runs all the deep tools

471
00:19:23,070 --> 00:19:25,380
that take a long time and we don't need

472
00:19:25,380 --> 00:19:26,550
you to look at the results just like

473
00:19:26,550 --> 00:19:28,950
press the button Friday so I could come

474
00:19:28,950 --> 00:19:30,510
in Monday and look at the results

475
00:19:30,510 --> 00:19:32,490
if you always carried a team that's so

476
00:19:32,490 --> 00:19:34,850
nice to make one for you please use it

477
00:19:34,850 --> 00:19:39,480
also another thing which sneaked might

478
00:19:39,480 --> 00:19:40,950
want to tell you about but like you want

479
00:19:40,950 --> 00:19:42,090
to check your third-party components

480
00:19:42,090 --> 00:19:44,970
right you like almost all apps right now

481
00:19:44,970 --> 00:19:48,210
like 50 60 70 80 % of each app is

482
00:19:48,210 --> 00:19:49,920
actually like all your libraries and

483
00:19:49,920 --> 00:19:51,480
it's your framework and your third-party

484
00:19:51,480 --> 00:19:53,460
little components that you don't even

485
00:19:53,460 --> 00:19:55,110
think about like oh it's just that fancy

486
00:19:55,110 --> 00:19:56,820
front-end we put in yes that is the

487
00:19:56,820 --> 00:19:59,190
thing that is wildly vulnerable so there

488
00:19:59,190 --> 00:20:00,780
are many many tools that you can put in

489
00:20:00,780 --> 00:20:01,980
your pipeline that are really really

490
00:20:01,980 --> 00:20:04,140
fast and you can just have it scan your

491
00:20:04,140 --> 00:20:06,330
repository just like weekly or something

492
00:20:06,330 --> 00:20:08,130
and tell you like oh that's the danger

493
00:20:08,130 --> 00:20:11,490
zone right like this is an easy check

494
00:20:11,490 --> 00:20:14,520
that's pretty fast and I highly

495
00:20:14,520 --> 00:20:15,210
recommend it

496
00:20:15,210 --> 00:20:17,490
oh there you go yes please help us tune

497
00:20:17,490 --> 00:20:19,020
our tools because we don't want to annoy

498
00:20:19,020 --> 00:20:20,580
you it's really important we don't annoy

499
00:20:20,580 --> 00:20:22,830
you we want to help you we want to be

500
00:20:22,830 --> 00:20:24,210
that person that you are happy to see

501
00:20:24,210 --> 00:20:28,410
not that person you like oh okay so the

502
00:20:28,410 --> 00:20:30,480
next one is and so my friend Morgan

503
00:20:30,480 --> 00:20:34,770
who's here he taught me this so who here

504
00:20:34,770 --> 00:20:37,020
has first let's talk about what positive

505
00:20:37,020 --> 00:20:38,790
testing is so positive testing you're

506
00:20:38,790 --> 00:20:40,200
making sure it does the thing it's

507
00:20:40,200 --> 00:20:42,750
supposed to do negative testing is

508
00:20:42,750 --> 00:20:44,700
making sure it doesn't do anything it

509
00:20:44,700 --> 00:20:47,940
should not do so let's say Tonya is

510
00:20:47,940 --> 00:20:49,650
gonna use your app and she's in a bad

511
00:20:49,650 --> 00:20:51,300
mood and she's like I'm gonna put in

512
00:20:51,300 --> 00:20:53,010
payloads and other things it's making

513
00:20:53,010 --> 00:20:55,500
sure it fails properly so the thing that

514
00:20:55,500 --> 00:20:57,990
you can do with this is so who here who

515
00:20:57,990 --> 00:20:59,970
here at work has complete coverage with

516
00:20:59,970 --> 00:21:01,560
unit tests for all their code just

517
00:21:01,560 --> 00:21:03,409
kidding I can't put on my head

518
00:21:03,409 --> 00:21:05,549
if anyone puts up their hand I'm always

519
00:21:05,549 --> 00:21:06,929
like you are not telling the truth

520
00:21:06,929 --> 00:21:09,389
um but who here has like some unit test

521
00:21:09,389 --> 00:21:11,369
right so you can take all of those unit

522
00:21:11,369 --> 00:21:12,509
tests and you can kind of change them

523
00:21:12,509 --> 00:21:14,429
around and then you all of a sudden have

524
00:21:14,429 --> 00:21:16,320
regressive security testing it's a

525
00:21:16,320 --> 00:21:18,539
pretty exciting idea and Roman has a

526
00:21:18,539 --> 00:21:21,509
cool video about it so this is photos

527
00:21:21,509 --> 00:21:24,690
too there are a bunch of really cool

528
00:21:24,690 --> 00:21:28,289
tools that do the checking of your

529
00:21:28,289 --> 00:21:30,059
third-party dependencies I often

530
00:21:30,059 --> 00:21:32,789
recommend doing two if you can in case

531
00:21:32,789 --> 00:21:34,320
one of them missed one of them we'll

532
00:21:34,320 --> 00:21:35,639
have them do it in a bunch of different

533
00:21:35,639 --> 00:21:38,009
ways especially if you're going to use a

534
00:21:38,009 --> 00:21:39,720
free one use another one because there's

535
00:21:39,720 --> 00:21:41,909
varying qualities to everything okay

536
00:21:41,909 --> 00:21:43,259
everyone was much faster at the photos

537
00:21:43,259 --> 00:21:45,389
this time thank you everyone okay so up

538
00:21:45,389 --> 00:21:46,979
next we're gonna talk about faster

539
00:21:46,979 --> 00:21:50,090
feedback and so that's right to left or

540
00:21:50,090 --> 00:21:55,679
amazing animations pushing left right so

541
00:21:55,679 --> 00:21:57,090
I'm a big fan of the idea of shifting

542
00:21:57,090 --> 00:21:59,700
security left or if they're not inviting

543
00:21:59,700 --> 00:22:02,700
you you push it left please hi you're

544
00:22:02,700 --> 00:22:04,409
having a requirement I didn't see my

545
00:22:04,409 --> 00:22:06,629
invite but I'm here now let's talk about

546
00:22:06,629 --> 00:22:09,869
the requirements for your project um the

547
00:22:09,869 --> 00:22:11,309
idea of pushing left is if we start

548
00:22:11,309 --> 00:22:13,409
security earlier we will get better

549
00:22:13,409 --> 00:22:15,179
results but don't trust me

550
00:22:15,179 --> 00:22:17,489
the Ponemon Institute came up with these

551
00:22:17,489 --> 00:22:19,979
great stats so the later you fix a

552
00:22:19,979 --> 00:22:22,320
security bug or any bug the more costs

553
00:22:22,320 --> 00:22:25,289
and a crappy er job you do so these are

554
00:22:25,289 --> 00:22:27,149
the stats according to them of exactly

555
00:22:27,149 --> 00:22:28,619
how much but basically it's

556
00:22:28,619 --> 00:22:30,840
exponentially more this as you go on

557
00:22:30,840 --> 00:22:33,210
it's just more and what's not on this is

558
00:22:33,210 --> 00:22:35,009
so it says like you know if you notice

559
00:22:35,009 --> 00:22:37,259
it in prod it doesn't have a number for

560
00:22:37,259 --> 00:22:39,960
if a bad person notices it improv and

561
00:22:39,960 --> 00:22:41,399
there's an incident and you have to call

562
00:22:41,399 --> 00:22:43,169
me in the middle of the night and I'm

563
00:22:43,169 --> 00:22:47,009
not nice I'm very grumpy

564
00:22:47,009 --> 00:22:49,679
I'm so glad my current job I don't have

565
00:22:49,679 --> 00:22:50,820
to do instant response

566
00:22:50,820 --> 00:22:55,529
I made them write that in okay so what

567
00:22:55,529 --> 00:22:56,940
does faster for you back me for security

568
00:22:56,940 --> 00:22:59,729
well for us it's awesome so if we can

569
00:22:59,729 --> 00:23:01,979
give you security feedback faster that

570
00:23:01,979 --> 00:23:02,759
is awesome

571
00:23:02,759 --> 00:23:04,799
I want you to know like great at the

572
00:23:04,799 --> 00:23:05,940
beginning of the things that you're

573
00:23:05,940 --> 00:23:09,269
doing like oh you know that you know

574
00:23:09,269 --> 00:23:11,609
that library that you're using for no

575
00:23:11,609 --> 00:23:13,440
dodgy guys like

576
00:23:13,440 --> 00:23:15,930
I would love to know that the beginning

577
00:23:15,930 --> 00:23:17,940
instead of like way down the line after

578
00:23:17,940 --> 00:23:20,930
I've been coding on it forever right

579
00:23:20,930 --> 00:23:26,880
okay and yes and the other thing like is

580
00:23:26,880 --> 00:23:29,070
what it means for Devon ops right so

581
00:23:29,070 --> 00:23:30,330
there's like a lot of things they can

582
00:23:30,330 --> 00:23:34,500
change so tell us if there's something

583
00:23:34,500 --> 00:23:36,870
that bothers you you the security team

584
00:23:36,870 --> 00:23:39,900
might not be as friendly as I seem but

585
00:23:39,900 --> 00:23:41,910
they have good intentions I promise you

586
00:23:41,910 --> 00:23:43,890
even when they yell no what you in a

587
00:23:43,890 --> 00:23:45,090
meeting because they're upset

588
00:23:45,090 --> 00:23:47,750
just kidding yelling is not allowed but

589
00:23:47,750 --> 00:23:50,070
but if you don't tell us what's wrong

590
00:23:50,070 --> 00:23:51,930
and we don't know when we can't fix it

591
00:23:51,930 --> 00:23:53,790
right like I've worked places where I'm

592
00:23:53,790 --> 00:23:55,500
like don't gossip behind my back and

593
00:23:55,500 --> 00:23:57,870
tell me how this your new rule I came

594
00:23:57,870 --> 00:23:59,940
out with his stupid tell me it's stupid

595
00:23:59,940 --> 00:24:02,280
so I can fix it and maybe say something

596
00:24:02,280 --> 00:24:03,720
instead of stupid use a nicer word

597
00:24:03,720 --> 00:24:06,780
that's professional but like feedback

598
00:24:06,780 --> 00:24:08,130
goes both ways so we're giving you

599
00:24:08,130 --> 00:24:09,990
feedback about security concerns we see

600
00:24:09,990 --> 00:24:11,760
please give us feedback about like hey

601
00:24:11,760 --> 00:24:13,290
Tanya you added this thing to our

602
00:24:13,290 --> 00:24:15,810
pipeline and now nothing publishes and

603
00:24:15,810 --> 00:24:17,370
we don't know what any of it means and

604
00:24:17,370 --> 00:24:19,050
we're pretty upset because we can't get

605
00:24:19,050 --> 00:24:20,610
our deadlines done thank you thanks for

606
00:24:20,610 --> 00:24:21,840
telling me instead of everyone else in

607
00:24:21,840 --> 00:24:24,360
the office Oh actually wait no there is

608
00:24:24,360 --> 00:24:28,650
more on this side actually no I am going

609
00:24:28,650 --> 00:24:30,570
to save that for this slide so and this

610
00:24:30,570 --> 00:24:32,670
is my friend Clint quince here where are

611
00:24:32,670 --> 00:24:35,370
you wave yeah hi so um

612
00:24:35,370 --> 00:24:36,780
Clint's really cool and he's speaking

613
00:24:36,780 --> 00:24:39,090
here too so he told this awesome story

614
00:24:39,090 --> 00:24:41,160
at upset California where he worked

615
00:24:41,160 --> 00:24:43,850
somewhere and there is this really old

616
00:24:43,850 --> 00:24:46,380
md5 hash function and they just did not

617
00:24:46,380 --> 00:24:48,330
want anyone using it anymore md5 is

618
00:24:48,330 --> 00:24:50,250
broken right but they didn't want to

619
00:24:50,250 --> 00:24:52,470
just like make it unusable right away so

620
00:24:52,470 --> 00:24:54,840
that like all these things broke right

621
00:24:54,840 --> 00:24:55,800
because there's all those backwards

622
00:24:55,800 --> 00:24:57,210
compatibility so instead they put this

623
00:24:57,210 --> 00:24:59,820
wrapper around it so people are coding

624
00:24:59,820 --> 00:25:00,930
and they would use it and then it would

625
00:25:00,930 --> 00:25:02,850
change in the ID and say non

626
00:25:02,850 --> 00:25:06,720
cryptographically secure md5 pretty good

627
00:25:06,720 --> 00:25:08,340
yeah and then usage went down basically

628
00:25:08,340 --> 00:25:11,370
to nothing immediately and so like it

629
00:25:11,370 --> 00:25:13,380
was like instant feedback like instant

630
00:25:13,380 --> 00:25:15,300
it could not get faster than that so you

631
00:25:15,300 --> 00:25:16,740
can be creative and come up with any

632
00:25:16,740 --> 00:25:17,330
idea

633
00:25:17,330 --> 00:25:20,420
you want but like doing this and telling

634
00:25:20,420 --> 00:25:22,340
the developer immediately is a lot

635
00:25:22,340 --> 00:25:23,450
better than like well we're just gonna

636
00:25:23,450 --> 00:25:24,890
make it not work anymore and then all

637
00:25:24,890 --> 00:25:26,390
these legacy apps don't work and then

638
00:25:26,390 --> 00:25:27,920
you better believe it everyone's pissed

639
00:25:27,920 --> 00:25:32,660
at you other things if the security team

640
00:25:32,660 --> 00:25:35,180
invites you to participate in activities

641
00:25:35,180 --> 00:25:37,670
please participate we need you they're

642
00:25:37,670 --> 00:25:38,840
very boring without you

643
00:25:38,840 --> 00:25:40,730
for instance if there's an incident and

644
00:25:40,730 --> 00:25:42,320
you are the person there's the lead of

645
00:25:42,320 --> 00:25:44,000
that app and you go home at 3:00 and you

646
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:45,500
don't tell us and the incidents

647
00:25:45,500 --> 00:25:47,240
happening and you're like I'll just see

648
00:25:47,240 --> 00:25:48,950
you tomorrow that makes a very bad night

649
00:25:48,950 --> 00:25:52,010
for me if there's threat modeling we

650
00:25:52,010 --> 00:25:54,590
should invite developers who here does

651
00:25:54,590 --> 00:25:56,540
threat modeling and invites developers

652
00:25:56,540 --> 00:25:59,750
yes yes if you do threat modeling you

653
00:25:59,750 --> 00:26:01,520
don't invite you felt like a developer

654
00:26:01,520 --> 00:26:03,740
trust me you're missing out there so

655
00:26:03,740 --> 00:26:05,900
evil they have so many great ideas they

656
00:26:05,900 --> 00:26:07,310
come up with so much tough ik I've never

657
00:26:07,310 --> 00:26:08,660
thought if they're like oh but then

658
00:26:08,660 --> 00:26:11,180
there's that admin to stuff from home

659
00:26:11,180 --> 00:26:13,760
that's not on the design plan but why

660
00:26:13,760 --> 00:26:15,650
are you telling me this now security

661
00:26:15,650 --> 00:26:18,320
Sprint's so I am a believer of begging

662
00:26:18,320 --> 00:26:20,450
project managers to put a security spray

663
00:26:20,450 --> 00:26:23,570
in the schedule and anything else that

664
00:26:23,570 --> 00:26:25,340
you need them to do so the more that we

665
00:26:25,340 --> 00:26:26,240
interact with them the more

666
00:26:26,240 --> 00:26:28,760
opportunities they have to learn and get

667
00:26:28,760 --> 00:26:31,100
to know us and trust us hopefully and I

668
00:26:31,100 --> 00:26:33,440
have one more thing on this slide and it

669
00:26:33,440 --> 00:26:38,150
is the start of if if you find a serious

670
00:26:38,150 --> 00:26:40,820
vulnerability in your pipeline you have

671
00:26:40,820 --> 00:26:43,700
to break the build and this is going to

672
00:26:43,700 --> 00:26:46,220
be a thing that makes you not popular

673
00:26:46,220 --> 00:26:47,960
right like I've worked a lot of places

674
00:26:47,960 --> 00:26:49,010
and they're like yeah you can do as much

675
00:26:49,010 --> 00:26:50,390
security testing as you want but like

676
00:26:50,390 --> 00:26:52,820
you like we're still going to prod but

677
00:26:52,820 --> 00:26:54,980
with a pipeline like you can now stop

678
00:26:54,980 --> 00:26:57,350
that and we should not take that

679
00:26:57,350 --> 00:26:59,660
responsibility lightly and only do it if

680
00:26:59,660 --> 00:27:02,720
for sure okay next slide oh and this is

681
00:27:02,720 --> 00:27:05,800
the photo side yes

682
00:27:12,630 --> 00:27:14,850
faster feedback is the key for so many

683
00:27:14,850 --> 00:27:17,250
things I'm sure none of you would want

684
00:27:17,250 --> 00:27:19,409
to hear what your boss wants from you at

685
00:27:19,409 --> 00:27:21,269
your year-end review do you want to hear

686
00:27:21,269 --> 00:27:22,470
at the beginning right so you can go

687
00:27:22,470 --> 00:27:24,990
knock all of those all of those goals

688
00:27:24,990 --> 00:27:27,960
into the Sun and so it definitely faster

689
00:27:27,960 --> 00:27:30,269
feedback all right next slide so the

690
00:27:30,269 --> 00:27:32,370
next one is continuous learning and

691
00:27:32,370 --> 00:27:36,960
continuous integrate continuous so you

692
00:27:36,960 --> 00:27:39,210
have feedback and that's great but I

693
00:27:39,210 --> 00:27:40,860
mean actually like learning so I don't

694
00:27:40,860 --> 00:27:43,169
have a cute you don't have like a cute

695
00:27:43,169 --> 00:27:45,870
little ASCII animation however basically

696
00:27:45,870 --> 00:27:47,730
this is culture change because a lot of

697
00:27:47,730 --> 00:27:49,559
places they don't value learning they

698
00:27:49,559 --> 00:27:51,929
say they do and they give you absolutely

699
00:27:51,929 --> 00:27:54,450
zero time to do it they don't

700
00:27:54,450 --> 00:27:56,009
financially support you and doing it in

701
00:27:56,009 --> 00:27:58,379
any way and you're kind of left to your

702
00:27:58,379 --> 00:27:59,789
own devices and a lot of people don't

703
00:27:59,789 --> 00:28:00,659
know where to start

704
00:28:00,659 --> 00:28:03,570
so let's talk about how we can weave

705
00:28:03,570 --> 00:28:07,320
some learning into our days so for the

706
00:28:07,320 --> 00:28:09,330
security team it means we have to

707
00:28:09,330 --> 00:28:12,929
allocate time to teach developers and

708
00:28:12,929 --> 00:28:15,750
ops folks and anyone else in it--he how

709
00:28:15,750 --> 00:28:17,539
to weave security into their daily work

710
00:28:17,539 --> 00:28:20,100
so where I used to work they're like oh

711
00:28:20,100 --> 00:28:21,299
we want you to do security awareness

712
00:28:21,299 --> 00:28:24,299
training and silly me I didn't tell

713
00:28:24,299 --> 00:28:26,100
people not to click on links like I did

714
00:28:26,100 --> 00:28:28,590
but I actually did in-depth training for

715
00:28:28,590 --> 00:28:30,539
like each different group so oh you're a

716
00:28:30,539 --> 00:28:33,179
sysadmin great you're a hackers favorite

717
00:28:33,179 --> 00:28:35,639
person and I went on about like the risk

718
00:28:35,639 --> 00:28:37,679
specific to their jobs and like what

719
00:28:37,679 --> 00:28:39,090
software developers I was teaching them

720
00:28:39,090 --> 00:28:40,409
how to do scanning and all of these

721
00:28:40,409 --> 00:28:43,080
things so we need to enable developers

722
00:28:43,080 --> 00:28:45,000
and ops we need to teach them like we

723
00:28:45,000 --> 00:28:46,740
have a lot of stuff in there in our

724
00:28:46,740 --> 00:28:48,509
heads that they wish was in their head

725
00:28:48,509 --> 00:28:50,720
so you need to share it with them

726
00:28:50,720 --> 00:28:54,450
another thing is if we have a pen test

727
00:28:54,450 --> 00:28:56,309
done or a security testing thing or

728
00:28:56,309 --> 00:28:58,259
anything like that done we need to share

729
00:28:58,259 --> 00:29:00,120
the results once we fix the things I

730
00:29:00,120 --> 00:29:02,070
know that's scary I really don't like

731
00:29:02,070 --> 00:29:04,110
admitting flaws ever a bit of a

732
00:29:04,110 --> 00:29:06,330
perfectionist and a control freak so

733
00:29:06,330 --> 00:29:09,870
it's a good combo but like you should

734
00:29:09,870 --> 00:29:12,000
take those test results first of all

735
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:13,769
like look for them in your pipeline that

736
00:29:13,769 --> 00:29:15,090
would be great if you could add them as

737
00:29:15,090 --> 00:29:16,649
unit tests or something like that but

738
00:29:16,649 --> 00:29:18,929
like if you see the same result over and

739
00:29:18,929 --> 00:29:21,210
over have a Lunch and Learn on that

740
00:29:21,210 --> 00:29:23,010
topic because the same developers make

741
00:29:23,010 --> 00:29:24,840
most of your apps right like I've worked

742
00:29:24,840 --> 00:29:25,610
out lots of places

743
00:29:25,610 --> 00:29:26,960
there's so much overlap between the

744
00:29:26,960 --> 00:29:28,850
project so if you're having lots and

745
00:29:28,850 --> 00:29:30,500
lots of Christ cross-site scripting you

746
00:29:30,500 --> 00:29:32,990
are trust me you are then you should do

747
00:29:32,990 --> 00:29:33,950
a deep dive lunch-and-learn

748
00:29:33,950 --> 00:29:36,410
onto like how to find it how to fix it

749
00:29:36,410 --> 00:29:38,299
like wait is a blacklist or a wait list

750
00:29:38,299 --> 00:29:41,840
ok I'm ranting I know but anyway it's

751
00:29:41,840 --> 00:29:43,700
our job to teach them we can't say oh

752
00:29:43,700 --> 00:29:45,559
those dumb developers don't know how to

753
00:29:45,559 --> 00:29:47,780
write good code it's their fault it's

754
00:29:47,780 --> 00:29:50,090
their responsibility it's it's ours

755
00:29:50,090 --> 00:29:52,100
that's my opinion it's ours if they

756
00:29:52,100 --> 00:29:53,299
don't know how to do something then I

757
00:29:53,299 --> 00:29:55,280
need to go show them I wish I could hire

758
00:29:55,280 --> 00:29:56,720
perfect developers that knew as much

759
00:29:56,720 --> 00:29:58,400
about security as I did but then they

760
00:29:58,400 --> 00:30:02,870
would want my job I don't want that ok

761
00:30:02,870 --> 00:30:04,640
so what does this mean for Devon Ops if

762
00:30:04,640 --> 00:30:07,130
we offer training we the security people

763
00:30:07,130 --> 00:30:09,250
please say yes oh my gosh please show up

764
00:30:09,250 --> 00:30:11,390
sometimes it's hard to make time

765
00:30:11,390 --> 00:30:13,370
you can also train yourself at the end

766
00:30:13,370 --> 00:30:14,840
of this talk I'm gonna give this big

767
00:30:14,840 --> 00:30:18,110
list of a whole bunch of free resources

768
00:30:18,110 --> 00:30:19,700
and there are way way way more this is

769
00:30:19,700 --> 00:30:21,799
just like my list of my favorites but

770
00:30:21,799 --> 00:30:23,540
there are so so many places where you

771
00:30:23,540 --> 00:30:25,429
can learn for free and even just like

772
00:30:25,429 --> 00:30:27,440
Friday afternoon like reserving the hour

773
00:30:27,440 --> 00:30:29,600
after lunch to watch like one video

774
00:30:29,600 --> 00:30:31,790
about app SEC you'd be surprised how

775
00:30:31,790 --> 00:30:33,290
much you can learn week after week if

776
00:30:33,290 --> 00:30:35,030
you actually keep to that small habit I

777
00:30:35,030 --> 00:30:37,070
used to do that and then I went through

778
00:30:37,070 --> 00:30:38,600
a bunch of university courses that way

779
00:30:38,600 --> 00:30:41,929
ok and then the last thing is if you're

780
00:30:41,929 --> 00:30:44,960
a developer or an ops person and the

781
00:30:44,960 --> 00:30:47,090
security team informs you of a security

782
00:30:47,090 --> 00:30:48,770
bug or vulnerability or thing that's new

783
00:30:48,770 --> 00:30:51,110
that you didn't know about tell the rest

784
00:30:51,110 --> 00:30:53,750
of your team tell everyone like oh yeah

785
00:30:53,750 --> 00:30:55,760
this and like we can't do that anymore

786
00:30:55,760 --> 00:30:57,710
because of Baba yeah they told me it was

787
00:30:57,710 --> 00:30:59,570
we had this big incident it was scary

788
00:30:59,570 --> 00:31:01,640
like I feel the security team should be

789
00:31:01,640 --> 00:31:03,860
sharing that info but if they're not you

790
00:31:03,860 --> 00:31:07,490
share the info another thing that it

791
00:31:07,490 --> 00:31:10,460
means is so I'm a big fan of practicing

792
00:31:10,460 --> 00:31:11,960
for the big day I used to work at

793
00:31:11,960 --> 00:31:14,059
Elections Canada and I helped run the

794
00:31:14,059 --> 00:31:16,760
election last time and they actually do

795
00:31:16,760 --> 00:31:18,320
a complete practice of the entire

796
00:31:18,320 --> 00:31:20,600
election six months before they build an

797
00:31:20,600 --> 00:31:22,309
office they build the network they do

798
00:31:22,309 --> 00:31:24,380
everything and then we just throw

799
00:31:24,380 --> 00:31:25,669
security incidents out of them because

800
00:31:25,669 --> 00:31:27,919
we're jerks and we throw in all sorts of

801
00:31:27,919 --> 00:31:29,510
fake problems in all of this and then we

802
00:31:29,510 --> 00:31:31,640
test all the stuff improve it and then

803
00:31:31,640 --> 00:31:33,429
on the real day we looked pretty good

804
00:31:33,429 --> 00:31:35,570
you can do this for everything so you

805
00:31:35,570 --> 00:31:36,530
can have like a fake and

806
00:31:36,530 --> 00:31:38,660
you can have a simulation simulation and

807
00:31:38,660 --> 00:31:40,760
you should invite developers to be a

808
00:31:40,760 --> 00:31:43,070
part of it so they know because I

809
00:31:43,070 --> 00:31:44,480
remember working somewhere once and

810
00:31:44,480 --> 00:31:46,370
flipping out on someone because they did

811
00:31:46,370 --> 00:31:47,930
not follow any of the protocols and it's

812
00:31:47,930 --> 00:31:50,060
because my team didn't actually tell

813
00:31:50,060 --> 00:31:52,040
anyone the protocols so if you practice

814
00:31:52,040 --> 00:31:53,660
then you could find out who doesn't know

815
00:31:53,660 --> 00:31:55,040
and if you missed a team with your

816
00:31:55,040 --> 00:31:58,730
training okay so this is a slide photo

817
00:31:58,730 --> 00:32:02,300
slide number four so accept the training

818
00:32:02,300 --> 00:32:04,750
train yourself share information widely

819
00:32:04,750 --> 00:32:07,280
participate please if there is a

820
00:32:07,280 --> 00:32:10,010
security simulation oh and then the Oh

821
00:32:10,010 --> 00:32:15,320
actually I didn't say the last two look

822
00:32:15,320 --> 00:32:17,210
at your metrics for security

823
00:32:17,210 --> 00:32:18,920
vulnerabilities you have and then try to

824
00:32:18,920 --> 00:32:21,080
knock out those bug classes everywhere

825
00:32:21,080 --> 00:32:22,970
that I've worked in AB sec okay can I

826
00:32:22,970 --> 00:32:24,530
see all the scans that you've ever done

827
00:32:24,530 --> 00:32:26,300
and then I look for patterns and

828
00:32:26,300 --> 00:32:28,130
whatever the top three are I do a Lunch

829
00:32:28,130 --> 00:32:30,140
and Learn and I will tell you the secret

830
00:32:30,140 --> 00:32:32,090
so two of the three are always the exact

831
00:32:32,090 --> 00:32:32,990
same everywhere

832
00:32:32,990 --> 00:32:35,420
there everyone is allergic to security

833
00:32:35,420 --> 00:32:37,640
headers and tons of cross-site scripting

834
00:32:37,640 --> 00:32:39,710
so you should just go watch some videos

835
00:32:39,710 --> 00:32:41,420
on that now and make everyone come in

836
00:32:41,420 --> 00:32:43,100
for lunch serve doughnuts because

837
00:32:43,100 --> 00:32:44,480
everyone is doing that everyone has

838
00:32:44,480 --> 00:32:45,680
problems with those two things and

839
00:32:45,680 --> 00:32:47,210
figure out what your things are and

840
00:32:47,210 --> 00:32:48,800
teach everyone so you don't have that

841
00:32:48,800 --> 00:32:52,700
problem anymore okay so now we want to

842
00:32:52,700 --> 00:32:54,890
talk about Security's everybody's job so

843
00:32:54,890 --> 00:32:56,120
if we're gonna change our culture we're

844
00:32:56,120 --> 00:32:58,100
gonna start doing DevOps we have to

845
00:32:58,100 --> 00:33:00,140
actually maintain that culture we can't

846
00:33:00,140 --> 00:33:01,760
just be like we had a meeting everyone's

847
00:33:01,760 --> 00:33:03,650
changed you have to like do you support

848
00:33:03,650 --> 00:33:06,020
of activities that actually happens okay

849
00:33:06,020 --> 00:33:09,470
so the first one is celebrate usually I

850
00:33:09,470 --> 00:33:10,940
have only seen the security team when I

851
00:33:10,940 --> 00:33:13,280
have done something very bad or

852
00:33:13,280 --> 00:33:15,230
something very bad is happening what if

853
00:33:15,230 --> 00:33:17,030
we celebrated when they did a good job

854
00:33:17,030 --> 00:33:18,650
like oh we did a Security's brand

855
00:33:18,650 --> 00:33:20,600
everyone did a great job awesome lunch

856
00:33:20,600 --> 00:33:23,750
is on us right we're like we had a pen

857
00:33:23,750 --> 00:33:25,820
tester in and you know that person could

858
00:33:25,820 --> 00:33:28,180
only find two things wrong awesome

859
00:33:28,180 --> 00:33:31,010
another thing is is I feel we should

860
00:33:31,010 --> 00:33:33,200
work more closely with our developer and

861
00:33:33,200 --> 00:33:35,540
operations counterparts I've worked in a

862
00:33:35,540 --> 00:33:36,830
bunch of places where the security team

863
00:33:36,830 --> 00:33:38,600
is actually in a separate building and

864
00:33:38,600 --> 00:33:40,730
what this results in is I

865
00:33:40,730 --> 00:33:42,260
don't know them personally and it's a

866
00:33:42,260 --> 00:33:44,840
lot harder for them to want to trust me

867
00:33:44,840 --> 00:33:48,070
listen to me all of those things it's um

868
00:33:48,070 --> 00:33:50,390
it's so much better if you can actually

869
00:33:50,390 --> 00:33:52,460
spend time with them because I don't

870
00:33:52,460 --> 00:33:56,270
know if you know they're people okay no

871
00:33:56,270 --> 00:33:58,340
more blaming so I had to learn this one

872
00:33:58,340 --> 00:34:00,110
when I joined security the first time

873
00:34:00,110 --> 00:34:02,570
there is an incident I like just blamed

874
00:34:02,570 --> 00:34:05,150
the other person never done an incident

875
00:34:05,150 --> 00:34:06,530
before I didn't know what's happening I

876
00:34:06,530 --> 00:34:09,109
was very upset that gets you nowhere

877
00:34:09,109 --> 00:34:11,570
instead of it's Bob or Alice's fault

878
00:34:11,570 --> 00:34:14,359
instead what safeguard was missing that

879
00:34:14,359 --> 00:34:16,129
this was able to happen or what training

880
00:34:16,129 --> 00:34:18,050
should we have given them or like what

881
00:34:18,050 --> 00:34:20,750
process is broken just find out what

882
00:34:20,750 --> 00:34:24,050
happened recover post-mortem figure out

883
00:34:24,050 --> 00:34:25,639
what happened and it's not it's that

884
00:34:25,639 --> 00:34:28,609
person's fault it's it's not a person if

885
00:34:28,609 --> 00:34:30,379
that person had something happened

886
00:34:30,379 --> 00:34:33,369
there's a reason that it happened okay I

887
00:34:33,369 --> 00:34:35,449
chose this picture because I feel she

888
00:34:35,449 --> 00:34:37,940
just looked like a total badass and

889
00:34:37,940 --> 00:34:39,168
she's like just outside the day Sarah

890
00:34:39,168 --> 00:34:41,418
she's like so you could be a security

891
00:34:41,418 --> 00:34:46,280
champion my friend ray wrote an awesome

892
00:34:46,280 --> 00:34:47,929
article about security champions last

893
00:34:47,929 --> 00:34:50,389
week but basically like they are your

894
00:34:50,389 --> 00:34:52,280
people that go and evangelize your

895
00:34:52,280 --> 00:34:54,199
message to everyone else in IT and they

896
00:34:54,199 --> 00:34:55,790
are your best friend so if there's

897
00:34:55,790 --> 00:34:57,320
someone that's like oh that was really

898
00:34:57,320 --> 00:34:58,970
cool about the incident last week like

899
00:34:58,970 --> 00:35:00,650
I'm interested to learn more buy them a

900
00:35:00,650 --> 00:35:02,900
book invite them on another incident if

901
00:35:02,900 --> 00:35:05,359
you are allowed teach them more and they

902
00:35:05,359 --> 00:35:07,040
might turn out like me where they end up

903
00:35:07,040 --> 00:35:11,570
just draining the security team and so

904
00:35:11,570 --> 00:35:12,890
this is the part of the talk where I get

905
00:35:12,890 --> 00:35:14,390
awkward so I might pretty good at

906
00:35:14,390 --> 00:35:16,250
getting awkward so I want to talk about

907
00:35:16,250 --> 00:35:18,350
so the definition of quality needs to

908
00:35:18,350 --> 00:35:20,030
change so quality includes security

909
00:35:20,030 --> 00:35:22,550
right so it means resilience learning

910
00:35:22,550 --> 00:35:26,060
speed feedback all of these things we

911
00:35:26,060 --> 00:35:29,119
can't have a good product if we put it

912
00:35:29,119 --> 00:35:30,650
on the internet and then someone knows

913
00:35:30,650 --> 00:35:32,900
your password after five minutes right

914
00:35:32,900 --> 00:35:37,369
even it has to be secure in order to be

915
00:35:37,369 --> 00:35:39,290
high quality and so I would like

916
00:35:39,290 --> 00:35:40,940
everyone to please put up your right

917
00:35:40,940 --> 00:35:42,410
hand because I'm gonna make you swear on

918
00:35:42,410 --> 00:35:46,070
it please put up your hands no your

919
00:35:46,070 --> 00:35:49,609
hands up yep yep okay one more okay okay

920
00:35:49,609 --> 00:35:51,870
so I promise

921
00:35:51,870 --> 00:35:58,150
that my definition of quality includes

922
00:35:58,150 --> 00:36:03,160
secure and I will do my best to create

923
00:36:03,160 --> 00:36:19,540
the most secure products I know how so

924
00:36:19,540 --> 00:36:21,370
in conclusion we've got this now we're

925
00:36:21,370 --> 00:36:23,890
all experts but more likely by tomorrow

926
00:36:23,890 --> 00:36:26,830
at like 5 p.m. when you see all the rest

927
00:36:26,830 --> 00:36:28,690
of amazing talks I'm so excited to see

928
00:36:28,690 --> 00:36:30,250
all of them but now if you get your

929
00:36:30,250 --> 00:36:31,540
camera's out I have a bunch of free

930
00:36:31,540 --> 00:36:33,970
resources so if you want to feel better

931
00:36:33,970 --> 00:36:36,340
about going to DevOps and learn about

932
00:36:36,340 --> 00:36:37,930
other people's mistakes we documented

933
00:36:37,930 --> 00:36:40,570
all of them because we want we really

934
00:36:40,570 --> 00:36:42,010
get a big fan when we have a post-mortem

935
00:36:42,010 --> 00:36:43,420
we put it on the internet so we want

936
00:36:43,420 --> 00:36:45,340
people to know so learn about our

937
00:36:45,340 --> 00:36:46,630
journey and it was not perfect

938
00:36:46,630 --> 00:36:50,590
immediately and we admit that I have an

939
00:36:50,590 --> 00:36:52,440
open source project and we make videos

940
00:36:52,440 --> 00:36:55,170
basically of us nerding out and doing

941
00:36:55,170 --> 00:36:57,340
like just trying to figure out where we

942
00:36:57,340 --> 00:36:58,810
as security professionals fit into

943
00:36:58,810 --> 00:37:01,150
DevOps and we make mistakes because I

944
00:37:01,150 --> 00:37:03,480
love it is live and that's okay

945
00:37:03,480 --> 00:37:05,680

and it's already available on my

1010
00:39:27,059 --> 00:39:28,739
SlideShare so if you want I could like

1011
00:39:28,739 --> 00:39:30,749
tweet a link and I can take the

1012
00:39:30,749 --> 00:39:32,009
conference and maybe that could retweet

1013
00:39:32,009 --> 00:39:33,539
it yeah absolutely and there's a video

1014
00:39:33,539 --> 00:40:06,449
of this talk online as well so he's

1015
00:40:06,449 --> 00:40:09,239
asking like sometimes management is just

1016
00:40:09,239 --> 00:40:11,099
so I'm accepting this risk I'm accepting

1017
00:40:11,099 --> 00:40:12,239
that risk and like everything's

1018
00:40:12,239 --> 00:40:13,739
literally burning down around you like

1019
00:40:13,739 --> 00:40:15,209
that sticker I was giving out earlier

1020
00:40:15,209 --> 00:40:17,459
and like when is it our responsibility

1021
00:40:17,459 --> 00:40:21,209
to resign so um I've resigned before in

1022
00:40:21,209 --> 00:40:27,959
protest and they know why like years ago

1023
00:40:27,959 --> 00:40:30,539
and but I've also done a thing where I

1024
00:40:30,539 --> 00:40:32,969
will just write up all of the risks very

1025
00:40:32,969 --> 00:40:34,799
clearly and then I sent it to the

1026
00:40:34,799 --> 00:40:36,539
departmental security officer in the sea

1027
00:40:36,539 --> 00:40:38,699
so and I asked for them to sign off on

1028
00:40:38,699 --> 00:40:40,589
the risk and the departmental like the

1029
00:40:40,589 --> 00:40:42,089
physical security officer called me is

1030
00:40:42,089 --> 00:40:45,989
like what is this I I'm not signing this

1031
00:40:45,989 --> 00:40:47,969
is ridiculous might build no one will

1032
00:40:47,969 --> 00:40:49,559
fix anything no one's giving me the time

1033
00:40:49,559 --> 00:40:51,630
of day and like you know our release is

1034
00:40:51,630 --> 00:40:53,309
coming soon like the big relieves to the

1035
00:40:53,309 --> 00:40:55,949
public right and I'm like we can't we

1036
00:40:55,949 --> 00:40:57,420
can't release this like this and no one

1037
00:40:57,420 --> 00:40:59,519
will do anything you tell them bill sent

1038
00:40:59,519 --> 00:41:01,499
you and I just go in the room I'm like

1039
00:41:01,499 --> 00:41:02,759
little bill said and everyone would just

1040
00:41:02,759 --> 00:41:06,020
jump and cuz I was like I'm not

1041
00:41:06,020 --> 00:41:07,940
to be on the security team and like

1042
00:41:07,940 --> 00:41:10,310
release this without you signing that

1043
00:41:10,310 --> 00:41:12,530
this is your fault because I've been

1044
00:41:12,530 --> 00:41:14,420
begging and pleading and like literally

1045
00:41:14,420 --> 00:41:16,070
bringing cookies to developers asking

1046
00:41:16,070 --> 00:41:18,500
them to do things and so you kind of

1047
00:41:18,500 --> 00:41:19,970
have those two options if you work in

1048
00:41:19,970 --> 00:41:21,920
security oh you could have a job anytime

1049
00:41:21,920 --> 00:41:23,720
you want just like tell the room you're

1050
00:41:23,720 --> 00:41:25,220
interested in people come tackle you

1051
00:41:25,220 --> 00:41:29,380
don't worry there's more places yes

1052
00:41:29,380 --> 00:41:33,140
coke and then you wait sorry you then

1053
00:41:33,140 --> 00:41:35,259
you

1054
00:41:50,130 --> 00:41:57,749
wait wait what was last one okay okay

1055
00:42:30,280 --> 00:42:33,110
very cool so just to summarize he said

1056
00:42:33,110 --> 00:42:34,550
there's three types of organizations

1057
00:42:34,550 --> 00:42:38,180
like learning bureaucratic and political

1058
00:42:38,180 --> 00:42:40,970
and depending upon the one you're in you

1059
00:42:40,970 --> 00:42:43,130
could change the way that you conduct

1060
00:42:43,130 --> 00:42:47,660
yourself which is definitely true so him

1061
00:42:47,660 --> 00:42:54,290
then you okay so follow up on the first

1062
00:42:54,290 --> 00:42:57,740
question about risk yes have you seen

1063
00:42:57,740 --> 00:43:00,950
any so I'm on the developer side of the

1064
00:43:00,950 --> 00:43:03,980
equation and one of things that we

1065
00:43:03,980 --> 00:43:05,630
always do is you know prioritize our

1066
00:43:05,630 --> 00:43:07,400
requirements we're getting our

1067
00:43:07,400 --> 00:43:09,020
requirements people just start talking

1068
00:43:09,020 --> 00:43:11,630
about cost of delay I'm trying to get

1069
00:43:11,630 --> 00:43:14,420
security people to talk in terms of risk

1070
00:43:14,420 --> 00:43:16,850
risk prioritization and cost of delay

1071
00:43:16,850 --> 00:43:19,820
that they're adding to the overall flow

1072
00:43:19,820 --> 00:43:23,170
have you seen anything like that

1073
00:43:23,170 --> 00:43:26,240
developer the security team for having

1074
00:43:26,240 --> 00:43:27,770
them add requirements that they refused

1075
00:43:27,770 --> 00:43:29,390
to explain and they just said because

1076
00:43:29,390 --> 00:43:32,060
security and I tell them that they have

1077
00:43:32,060 --> 00:43:33,890
to actually explain why we need them or

1078
00:43:33,890 --> 00:43:34,940
I'm not willing to put them on my

1079
00:43:34,940 --> 00:43:38,450
project I was like the lead developer

1080
00:43:38,450 --> 00:43:39,740
for a really long time so I was very

1081
00:43:39,740 --> 00:43:43,930
stern I think that it's okay to ask

1082
00:43:43,930 --> 00:43:45,860
security people like to hold them at a

1083
00:43:45,860 --> 00:43:47,630
higher level and like yeah if this is

1084
00:43:47,630 --> 00:43:49,480
gonna add one year to our project like

1085
00:43:49,480 --> 00:43:53,660
we need to justify yeah quant quantifies

1086
00:43:53,660 --> 00:43:54,110
at risk

1087
00:43:54,110 --> 00:43:59,450
yeah yeah I definitely don't do risk

1088
00:43:59,450 --> 00:44:03,080
management I only write risk early

1089
00:44:03,080 --> 00:44:04,880
sheets if I'm just like I'm not willing

1090
00:44:04,880 --> 00:44:07,340
to have my name on this is so bad but

1091
00:44:07,340 --> 00:44:09,440
that is a very good question and I would

1092
00:44:09,440 --> 00:44:11,480
love to see risk quantified a lot more

1093
00:44:11,480 --> 00:44:13,670
it's really hard so why I actually went

1094
00:44:13,670 --> 00:44:15,140
in took like some communication classes

1095
00:44:15,140 --> 00:44:16,550
so that I could be better at it because

1096
00:44:16,550 --> 00:44:18,590
I was told just yelling loudly isn't a

1097
00:44:18,590 --> 00:44:22,250
really good strategy Tanya no and I

1098
00:44:22,250 --> 00:44:24,110
might need to take your question after

1099
00:44:24,110 --> 00:44:25,730
yeah man I don't want to talk I don't

1100
00:44:25,730 --> 00:44:27,050
wanna go into the next person's talk

1101
00:44:27,050 --> 00:44:28,580
thank you so much for everyone and like

1102
00:44:28,580 --> 00:44:29,780
all talk

1103
00:44:29,780 --> 00:44:34,949
[Applause]
