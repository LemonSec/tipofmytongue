1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,230
lessons to teach us so Nick says yours

2
00:00:03,230 --> 00:00:06,450
good afternoon everyone

3
00:00:06,450 --> 00:00:09,840
so I have I have a question I have a

4
00:00:09,840 --> 00:00:12,300
question for everybody works in

5
00:00:12,300 --> 00:00:14,250
cybersecurity I presume you're here at

6
00:00:14,250 --> 00:00:16,590
the keynote so that means you all work

7
00:00:16,590 --> 00:00:20,390
in cybersecurity now is that correct a

8
00:00:20,390 --> 00:00:22,529
little bit louder I know it's the first

9
00:00:22,529 --> 00:00:25,560
talk in the afternoon the dress is

10
00:00:25,560 --> 00:00:27,900
nowhere near as good as Tonya's do we

11
00:00:27,900 --> 00:00:30,150
all work in cybersecurity now or will do

12
00:00:30,150 --> 00:00:32,750
by the end of this convened conference

13
00:00:32,750 --> 00:00:35,219
that's better that'll do that'll do for

14
00:00:35,219 --> 00:00:38,809
the afternoon so for security people I

15
00:00:38,809 --> 00:00:41,790
have a question if we're all so smart

16
00:00:41,790 --> 00:00:44,040
which we are you know how smart the

17
00:00:44,040 --> 00:00:46,440
people are in this industry if we work

18
00:00:46,440 --> 00:00:50,340
so hard especially again as industry you

19
00:00:50,340 --> 00:00:53,070
know how hard people work you think

20
00:00:53,070 --> 00:00:55,079
about the state of cybersecurity why is

21
00:00:55,079 --> 00:00:58,440
it so awful considering the first two

22
00:00:58,440 --> 00:01:01,469
factors that's the question I have I

23
00:01:01,469 --> 00:01:03,500
expect you will have questions as well

24
00:01:03,500 --> 00:01:06,330
my contact details will be up at the end

25
00:01:06,330 --> 00:01:08,909
all references in this presentation

26
00:01:08,909 --> 00:01:10,950
either have been blogged or will be

27
00:01:10,950 --> 00:01:12,540
blogged to be honest

28
00:01:12,540 --> 00:01:14,760
eventually I'm still thinking some of

29
00:01:14,760 --> 00:01:17,130
this through thank you very much to

30
00:01:17,130 --> 00:01:18,450
Mandy from a look at making me look

31
00:01:18,450 --> 00:01:20,340
really bad she's put her slides up

32
00:01:20,340 --> 00:01:23,369
already nicely done this is not a

33
00:01:23,369 --> 00:01:25,650
typical presentation this is not really

34
00:01:25,650 --> 00:01:27,689
a linear presentation this is more what

35
00:01:27,689 --> 00:01:31,380
you see in those crime dramas on TV this

36
00:01:31,380 --> 00:01:34,380
is an investigation wall this is a crime

37
00:01:34,380 --> 00:01:37,290
wall in trying to solve that question

38
00:01:37,290 --> 00:01:39,360
why are things so awful I have a few

39
00:01:39,360 --> 00:01:42,119
ideas I've put them up on the wall put

40
00:01:42,119 --> 00:01:44,250
ideas and strings between them trying to

41
00:01:44,250 --> 00:01:46,680
figure this out I've only got time this

42
00:01:46,680 --> 00:01:49,350
afternoon to show you a few of the ideas

43
00:01:49,350 --> 00:01:53,790
I have and what's also some of what I've

44
00:01:53,790 --> 00:01:56,579
got is seedlings it really is the

45
00:01:56,579 --> 00:01:59,579
beginning of an idea I don't have

46
00:01:59,579 --> 00:02:02,070
solutions I don't have answers and maybe

47
00:02:02,070 --> 00:02:03,600
getting to the stage of asking the right

48
00:02:03,600 --> 00:02:08,929
question for a framework to build this

49
00:02:08,929 --> 00:02:12,000
investigation on I'm basically stealing

50
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:13,770
someone else's idea so when I was

51
00:02:13,770 --> 00:02:16,200
slides the presentation when the cyber

52
00:02:16,200 --> 00:02:18,930
war with zero trust by John kinder vac

53
00:02:18,930 --> 00:02:22,710
filled CTO of Palo Alto now he gives a

54
00:02:22,710 --> 00:02:25,800
presentation where he explains the four

55
00:02:25,800 --> 00:02:27,660
levels of war grand strategy strategy

56
00:02:27,660 --> 00:02:30,390
tactics operations as you see from the

57
00:02:30,390 --> 00:02:32,130
ultimate goal all the way down to the

58
00:02:32,130 --> 00:02:35,100
way you use your tools now in cyber war

59
00:02:35,100 --> 00:02:37,350
same again grand strategy stop data

60
00:02:37,350 --> 00:02:39,810
breaches all the way down to tactics

61
00:02:39,810 --> 00:02:41,730
being the tools you use and operations

62
00:02:41,730 --> 00:02:43,500
being the platform that those tools sit

63
00:02:43,500 --> 00:02:46,200
on what I like about his presentation is

64
00:02:46,200 --> 00:02:49,320
that he looks at strategy which I don't

65
00:02:49,320 --> 00:02:51,240
think we do enough in this industry

66
00:02:51,240 --> 00:02:53,400
rather than tactics rather than looking

67
00:02:53,400 --> 00:02:57,300
at tools for cyber war the strategy is

68
00:02:57,300 --> 00:03:00,900
the big idea in each section what's a

69
00:03:00,900 --> 00:03:03,180
big idea in that part of the industry

70
00:03:03,180 --> 00:03:06,360
and I credit you especially to Morgan

71
00:03:06,360 --> 00:03:09,060
Roman earlier as I've just said we don't

72
00:03:09,060 --> 00:03:10,680
talk about strategy enough that's

73
00:03:10,680 --> 00:03:13,800
literally what he did this morning as in

74
00:03:13,800 --> 00:03:16,410
make the secure way the easy way is this

75
00:03:16,410 --> 00:03:19,430
strategy of what he advocated and then

76
00:03:19,430 --> 00:03:21,630
listed some tools but the tools in the

77
00:03:21,630 --> 00:03:23,370
strategy were independent of each other

78
00:03:23,370 --> 00:03:26,670
so looking at appropriately for where we

79
00:03:26,670 --> 00:03:30,390
are the big idea of dev sec and ops the

80
00:03:30,390 --> 00:03:32,280
areas I'm most familiar with either

81
00:03:32,280 --> 00:03:34,110
because I was a penetration tester I've

82
00:03:34,110 --> 00:03:36,060
worked with a lot of developers what's

83
00:03:36,060 --> 00:03:38,910
the big idea in each of these areas for

84
00:03:38,910 --> 00:03:40,950
developers it's be the best developer

85
00:03:40,950 --> 00:03:44,430
you can be that mythical 10x developer

86
00:03:44,430 --> 00:03:46,050
who's just better than everyone else and

87
00:03:46,050 --> 00:03:48,060
as a good developer you harden your code

88
00:03:48,060 --> 00:03:50,940
as a penetration tester be the best

89
00:03:50,940 --> 00:03:53,910
penetration tester you can be you have

90
00:03:53,910 --> 00:03:56,430
to have continual technical improvement

91
00:03:56,430 --> 00:03:58,680
there are always more vulnerabilities

92
00:03:58,680 --> 00:04:00,110
you should learn those vulnerabilities

93
00:04:00,110 --> 00:04:03,090
because you use the floor hypothesis

94
00:04:03,090 --> 00:04:05,520
methodology the only way your customers

95
00:04:05,520 --> 00:04:08,100
are more secure is if you test those

96
00:04:08,100 --> 00:04:09,600
security weaknesses and see if it

97
00:04:09,600 --> 00:04:12,360
applies to them for operations you

98
00:04:12,360 --> 00:04:15,780
follow the CIS talk to any critical

99
00:04:15,780 --> 00:04:19,019
security controls it's all about harden

100
00:04:19,019 --> 00:04:21,029
your systems these how system

101
00:04:21,029 --> 00:04:24,720
administrators think so this is how we

102
00:04:24,720 --> 00:04:26,800
learn and train and act

103
00:04:26,800 --> 00:04:28,690
as I'm sure many of you familiar with

104
00:04:28,690 --> 00:04:31,300
the process late at night you and your

105
00:04:31,300 --> 00:04:35,620
laptop on your own spinning up VMs lots

106
00:04:35,620 --> 00:04:38,169
of passion put into your project to

107
00:04:38,169 --> 00:04:40,659
becoming the best technical practitioner

108
00:04:40,659 --> 00:04:42,849
you can be also with the applications

109
00:04:42,849 --> 00:04:45,659
you develop the applications you build

110
00:04:45,659 --> 00:04:48,310
you basically build the best robot you

111
00:04:48,310 --> 00:04:50,710
can you build the best application you

112
00:04:50,710 --> 00:04:52,599
can build the best infrastructure you

113
00:04:52,599 --> 00:04:54,220
can you then send it out into the world

114
00:04:54,220 --> 00:04:56,860
on its own see how it gets on if it gets

115
00:04:56,860 --> 00:04:59,110
compromised you build a better robot and

116
00:04:59,110 --> 00:05:02,110
send that out so that's our grand

117
00:05:02,110 --> 00:05:04,210
strategy be the best technical

118
00:05:04,210 --> 00:05:06,669
practitioner you can be build something

119
00:05:06,669 --> 00:05:08,919
as secure as you could build it where

120
00:05:08,919 --> 00:05:11,169
has this goddess if you look at breach

121
00:05:11,169 --> 00:05:14,770
level index calm since 2013 there have

122
00:05:14,770 --> 00:05:18,580
been almost 15 billion data records lost

123
00:05:18,580 --> 00:05:21,460
or stolen since 2013 if you just look at

124
00:05:21,460 --> 00:05:23,710
the news quickly so the owner had a

125
00:05:23,710 --> 00:05:26,229
business email compromised they lost 37

126
00:05:26,229 --> 00:05:28,270
million dollars and will need need to

127
00:05:28,270 --> 00:05:30,129
change their earnings forecast in August

128
00:05:30,129 --> 00:05:33,819
2019 the manufacturer the internet

129
00:05:33,819 --> 00:05:37,719
radios there are a million radios online

130
00:05:37,719 --> 00:05:40,479
with a vulnerability that's older than

131
00:05:40,479 --> 00:05:43,000
at least half this audience so you look

132
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:45,690
at evite the social planning website in

133
00:05:45,690 --> 00:05:48,969
April 2019 they identified that they

134
00:05:48,969 --> 00:05:52,000
were compromised in so in August sorry

135
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:53,409
in April 2019

136
00:05:53,409 --> 00:05:54,729
that identified there had been

137
00:05:54,729 --> 00:05:58,270
compromised in August 2013 so we're

138
00:05:58,270 --> 00:06:00,550
looking at a six year dwell time over a

139
00:06:00,550 --> 00:06:02,349
hundred million email over 100 million

million accounts breach May 2018

147
00:06:25,120 --> 00:06:28,150
announced August 2019 and if you thought

148
00:06:28,150 --> 00:06:31,990
hackers had everything Poshmark was when

149
00:06:31,990 --> 00:06:33,520
the part was compromised hackers got

150
00:06:33,520 --> 00:06:37,169
your names emails locations gender

151
00:06:37,169 --> 00:06:40,010
password and size pref

152
00:06:40,010 --> 00:06:43,460
is the size of your clothing is on the

153
00:06:43,460 --> 00:06:45,860
dark web now is the state we've got in

154
00:06:45,860 --> 00:06:48,170
cybersecurity and I thought this was as

155
00:06:48,170 --> 00:06:49,730
bad as it would get for this part of the

156
00:06:49,730 --> 00:06:51,110
presentation then I looked at the news

157
00:06:51,110 --> 00:06:51,970
this morning

158
00:06:51,970 --> 00:06:55,940
almost every citizen of Ecuador has

159
00:06:55,940 --> 00:06:57,860
their person was their personal details

160
00:06:57,860 --> 00:07:01,820
on an open cloud server which VPN mentor

161
00:07:01,820 --> 00:07:05,450
discovered told the relevant cert that's

162
00:07:05,450 --> 00:07:09,170
now been shut down rapid7 did a great

163
00:07:09,170 --> 00:07:12,020
blog analyzed in the last verizon

164
00:07:12,020 --> 00:07:14,900
business incident report if you look at

165
00:07:14,900 --> 00:07:16,760
the time to compromise the target

166
00:07:16,760 --> 00:07:19,310
hackers generally do that in minutes

167
00:07:19,310 --> 00:07:21,650
between the initial breach and the

168
00:07:21,650 --> 00:07:24,230
sufficient level of compromise if you

169
00:07:24,230 --> 00:07:27,190
look at the detection of that compromise

170
00:07:27,190 --> 00:07:30,200
that time is measured on average in

171
00:07:30,200 --> 00:07:33,950
months so minutes to compromise months

172
00:07:33,950 --> 00:07:37,220
to detect if you look at the Global Risk

173
00:07:37,220 --> 00:07:41,120
report from 2019 you look at risks to

174
00:07:41,120 --> 00:07:44,180
humanity in general over thousands of

175
00:07:44,180 --> 00:07:44,920
years

176
00:07:44,920 --> 00:07:47,870
climate change is up here

177
00:07:47,870 --> 00:07:49,910
if you cross-reference impact and

178
00:07:49,910 --> 00:07:54,230
likelihood cybersecurity the industry

179
00:07:54,230 --> 00:07:56,270
you're now all part of because you all

180
00:07:56,270 --> 00:07:58,700
swore allegiance to tenure and I was at

181
00:07:58,700 --> 00:08:00,890
the back and saw you all do it so this

182
00:08:00,890 --> 00:08:04,750
is all your fault now cybersecurity

183
00:08:04,750 --> 00:08:08,000
impact versus likelihood is there after

184
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:11,030
30 years that's the state of the

185
00:08:11,030 --> 00:08:13,970
industry we're all in so that's where

186
00:08:13,970 --> 00:08:15,940
it's got us

187
00:08:15,940 --> 00:08:18,950
solitaire study being the best technical

188
00:08:18,950 --> 00:08:21,260
technical practitioner you can be and

189
00:08:21,260 --> 00:08:24,560
building standalone applications the

190
00:08:24,560 --> 00:08:27,620
infrastructure to your best technical

191
00:08:27,620 --> 00:08:31,220
standard and what that strategy reminds

192
00:08:31,220 --> 00:08:35,169
me of is this

193
00:08:41,510 --> 00:08:44,149
now this is someone practicing golf

194
00:08:44,149 --> 00:08:50,700
which is fine get the best golf club you

195
00:08:50,700 --> 00:08:54,899
can get practice your shot practice over

196
00:08:54,899 --> 00:08:58,230
and over again and as they say this is

197
00:08:58,230 --> 00:09:01,410
fine because when you play golf it looks

198
00:09:01,410 --> 00:09:06,000
like this there's no one attacking you

199
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:07,920
there's no one distracting you the holes

200
00:09:07,920 --> 00:09:09,480
not going to move the flags not going to

201
00:09:09,480 --> 00:09:10,680
move no one's going to take the ball

202
00:09:10,680 --> 00:09:14,399
away the caddie cannot advise you it's

203
00:09:14,399 --> 00:09:17,130
the best tool you can get the best

204
00:09:17,130 --> 00:09:19,529
technical ability you can have that's

205
00:09:19,529 --> 00:09:23,519
why this is how you practice golf and

206
00:09:23,519 --> 00:09:25,529
what we've got in this industry is

207
00:09:25,529 --> 00:09:28,380
tactics the training methodology based

208
00:09:28,380 --> 00:09:31,470
on golf be the best you can be build the

209
00:09:31,470 --> 00:09:34,110
best thing you can independently that

210
00:09:34,110 --> 00:09:36,209
has involved without thinking it into a

211
00:09:36,209 --> 00:09:39,540
strategy based on the same concepts the

212
00:09:39,540 --> 00:09:43,940
same concepts like golf and I think

213
00:09:43,940 --> 00:09:47,399
we're thinking about this in terms of

214
00:09:47,399 --> 00:09:51,560
the wrong game now that's a really weird

215
00:09:51,560 --> 00:09:54,779
metaphorical way to look at this so

216
00:09:54,779 --> 00:09:56,910
looking around it can I justify using

217
00:09:56,910 --> 00:09:58,589
this kind of merit of metaphorical way

218
00:09:58,589 --> 00:10:01,290
of thinking I came across trees on

219
00:10:01,290 --> 00:10:03,240
Wikipedia the articles worth reading

220
00:10:03,240 --> 00:10:06,180
basically trees is Russian is the

221
00:10:06,180 --> 00:10:07,589
acronym for where was Russian for the

222
00:10:07,589 --> 00:10:09,240
theory of inventive problem-solving

223
00:10:09,240 --> 00:10:11,480
there was a science fiction author and

224
00:10:11,480 --> 00:10:14,699
inventor in the 1950s when lit through

225
00:10:14,699 --> 00:10:16,649
literally every invention in the Russian

226
00:10:16,649 --> 00:10:18,899
system looked at the characteristics of

227
00:10:18,899 --> 00:10:21,029
the problems they solved look at the

228
00:10:21,029 --> 00:10:22,980
patterns in the solutions and realized

229
00:10:22,980 --> 00:10:24,990
going through them all a sufficient

230
00:10:24,990 --> 00:10:27,630
level of abstraction you can use other

231
00:10:27,630 --> 00:10:30,000
people's solutions someone has already

232
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:33,149
solved your problem you can save time by

233
00:10:33,149 --> 00:10:35,130
looking at your problem in an abstract

234
00:10:35,130 --> 00:10:37,500
way so rather a traditional way of

235
00:10:37,500 --> 00:10:39,029
problem solving you think about your

236
00:10:39,029 --> 00:10:40,829
problem you think about the context of

237
00:10:40,829 --> 00:10:42,779
your problem you just keep banging your

238
00:10:42,779 --> 00:10:44,579
head against that wall until you get the

239
00:10:44,579 --> 00:10:47,579
solution the trees way of thinking is

240
00:10:47,579 --> 00:10:49,050
you look at the world's conceptual

241
00:10:49,050 --> 00:10:51,839
problems and find one like yours you

242
00:10:51,839 --> 00:10:53,670
look at then the solution that has been

243
00:10:53,670 --> 00:10:55,200
used to solve that problem

244
00:10:55,200 --> 00:10:58,769
and then just adopt their solution now

245
00:10:58,769 --> 00:11:02,360
for this this different way of thinking

246
00:11:02,360 --> 00:11:04,709
looking at someone who's solved the

247
00:11:04,709 --> 00:11:06,300
problem reminds me of this from

248
00:11:06,300 --> 00:11:08,490
management consultancy from business

249
00:11:08,490 --> 00:11:11,190
models it's the double s-curve model if

250
00:11:11,190 --> 00:11:13,769
those those of you who are with startups

251
00:11:13,769 --> 00:11:15,300
and scallops will be familiar with this

252
00:11:15,300 --> 00:11:17,550
at a start-up you start on what's known

253
00:11:17,550 --> 00:11:19,290
as the next curve a particular way of

254
00:11:19,290 --> 00:11:21,449
working but as you can see after a

255
00:11:21,449 --> 00:11:23,220
certain period of time you put more and

256
00:11:23,220 --> 00:11:25,260
more effort into that way of working and

257
00:11:25,260 --> 00:11:27,360
it pays less and less dividends you get

258
00:11:27,360 --> 00:11:29,670
less and less reward so you have to jump

259
00:11:29,670 --> 00:11:31,620
the s-curve to a different way of

260
00:11:31,620 --> 00:11:34,470
working to get you to get the rewards

261
00:11:34,470 --> 00:11:36,810
you deserve from the effort you put in

262
00:11:36,810 --> 00:11:39,149
and I think that's where this industry

263
00:11:39,149 --> 00:11:41,880
is at at what's known as an inflection

264
00:11:41,880 --> 00:11:43,529
point you see there in the middle known

265
00:11:43,529 --> 00:11:46,560
as a strategic inflection point you have

266
00:11:46,560 --> 00:11:48,630
to change the way you work or things

267
00:11:48,630 --> 00:11:50,519
will not continue or things will not

268
00:11:50,519 --> 00:11:53,880
improve and talking to leading tris

269
00:11:53,880 --> 00:11:55,649
consultant Devilman of systemic

270
00:11:55,649 --> 00:11:59,399
innovation he said to find who's got a

271
00:11:59,399 --> 00:12:00,870
problem like yours

272
00:12:00,870 --> 00:12:03,000
so you can find the solution look for

273
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:04,589
someone who has a more extreme version

274
00:12:04,589 --> 00:12:07,829
of your problem because I think if our

275
00:12:07,829 --> 00:12:10,260
problem was like golf just be the best

276
00:12:10,260 --> 00:12:11,820
you can be and that's the way to solve

277
00:12:11,820 --> 00:12:14,870
the problem we'd all like this guy and

278
00:12:14,870 --> 00:12:17,459
if you know anyone who's worked in

279
00:12:17,459 --> 00:12:19,380
cybersecurity longer than the three or

280
00:12:19,380 --> 00:12:20,820
four hours most of you have worked in

281
00:12:20,820 --> 00:12:23,070
cybersecurity you know they all look

282
00:12:23,070 --> 00:12:25,829
like this and various conversations I've

283
00:12:25,829 --> 00:12:27,300
had today with some of the older members

284
00:12:27,300 --> 00:12:30,480
of the industry have back that up so

285
00:12:30,480 --> 00:12:31,980
think about the problems you have in

286
00:12:31,980 --> 00:12:33,600
cybersecurity think about the people

287
00:12:33,600 --> 00:12:35,310
you've spoken to thinking about maybe

288
00:12:35,310 --> 00:12:36,870
the problems you've had the incidents

289
00:12:36,870 --> 00:12:38,579
you've been involved with the demands

290
00:12:38,579 --> 00:12:42,930
you've been under think about the day

291
00:12:42,930 --> 00:12:45,269
that involves think about how that looks

292
00:12:45,269 --> 00:12:48,060
think about how that sounds think about

293
00:12:48,060 --> 00:12:49,680
how that feels think about your

294
00:12:49,680 --> 00:12:51,360
colleagues think about your managers

295
00:12:51,360 --> 00:12:54,420
demands I think it feels something like

296
00:12:54,420 --> 00:12:56,779
this

297
00:13:15,060 --> 00:13:18,430
[Applause]

298
00:13:22,590 --> 00:13:25,629
[Music]

299
00:13:26,160 --> 00:13:31,510
the pages jump into conscience plan this

300
00:13:31,510 --> 00:13:35,220
is a form of accommodation coverage

301
00:13:58,370 --> 00:14:00,230
[Applause]

302
00:14:00,230 --> 00:14:03,300
now look him around the room some of you

303
00:14:03,300 --> 00:14:06,330
are thinking oh great sports especially

304
00:14:06,330 --> 00:14:08,940
in Seattle that's exactly why I came to

305
00:14:08,940 --> 00:14:11,430
dev SEC on others of you have noticed my

306
00:14:11,430 --> 00:14:13,920
accent are thinking oh great the Brit

307
00:14:13,920 --> 00:14:16,830
has flown over here to literally tell us

308
00:14:16,830 --> 00:14:19,040
about the sport they call in the UK

309
00:14:19,040 --> 00:14:21,930
American football but bear with me I

310
00:14:21,930 --> 00:14:24,000
think there's a lot in common between

311
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:27,900
the NFL and cybersecurity first of all

312
00:14:27,900 --> 00:14:30,060
if you don't understand it it makes no

313
00:14:30,060 --> 00:14:31,500
sense at all

314
00:14:31,500 --> 00:14:35,280
you for those of you haven't grown up

315
00:14:35,280 --> 00:14:37,140
with the sport why are they stopping and

316
00:14:37,140 --> 00:14:39,120
starting what on earth is the

317
00:14:39,120 --> 00:14:41,700
terminology they're saying what is going

318
00:14:41,700 --> 00:14:43,650
on cybersecurity if you've tried to

319
00:14:43,650 --> 00:14:46,560
explain it to your friends to your

320
00:14:46,560 --> 00:14:47,850
relatives you've all got that to look

321
00:14:47,850 --> 00:14:49,320
forward to over Thanksgiving and

322
00:14:49,320 --> 00:14:51,930
Christmas exactly the same makes no

323
00:14:51,930 --> 00:14:54,380
sense the concepts make no sense

324
00:14:54,380 --> 00:14:57,780
incredibly complex both of them both

325
00:14:57,780 --> 00:15:01,290
team games something we miss a lot both

326
00:15:01,290 --> 00:15:03,270
the people you work with the people you

327
00:15:03,270 --> 00:15:05,460
work against is something we don't

328
00:15:05,460 --> 00:15:08,430
realize at all very highly specialized

329
00:15:08,430 --> 00:15:10,590
both by situation and in attack and

330
00:15:10,590 --> 00:15:12,150
defense I would argue it's the only

331
00:15:12,150 --> 00:15:15,420
sport like that of course they've both

332
00:15:15,420 --> 00:15:17,880
got offensive and defensive play box

333
00:15:17,880 --> 00:15:20,250
especially incident response and both

334
00:15:20,250 --> 00:15:22,350
most importantly our fight over

335
00:15:22,350 --> 00:15:24,150
territory there are enough similarities

336
00:15:24,150 --> 00:15:27,690
between the two that maybe the people

337
00:15:27,690 --> 00:15:29,760
facing that problem at an abstract level

338
00:15:29,760 --> 00:15:33,060
have solved ours and not only should we

339
00:15:33,060 --> 00:15:34,620
learn something from American football

340
00:15:34,620 --> 00:15:36,750
or as you call area here football I

341
00:15:36,750 --> 00:15:38,460
think there's a lot to learn from

342
00:15:38,460 --> 00:15:41,720
warfare as well this actual study of

343
00:15:41,720 --> 00:15:44,400
warfare and especially war gamers and

344
00:15:44,400 --> 00:15:46,380
what is called in the UK operational

345
00:15:46,380 --> 00:15:48,030
research I think in the u.s. is called

346
00:15:48,030 --> 00:15:50,670
operations research but looking at what

347
00:15:50,670 --> 00:15:53,070
we can learn from football who should we

348
00:15:53,070 --> 00:15:55,350
learn from now as some of you will know

349
00:15:55,350 --> 00:15:56,910
an American football team is so big

350
00:15:56,910 --> 00:15:59,220
you've got first you've got um

351
00:15:59,220 --> 00:16:01,470
these sides as I say when you've got the

352
00:16:01,470 --> 00:16:02,880
before when you've got the ball and when

353
00:16:02,880 --> 00:16:05,280
you haven't the offense and the defense

354
00:16:05,280 --> 00:16:07,500
we're defenders so we should look to a

355
00:16:07,500 --> 00:16:11,550
defense now I might be a bit biased but

356
00:16:11,550 --> 00:16:13,290
I've been following the Seattle Seahawks

357
00:16:13,290 --> 00:16:15,270
since I was about 15 years old it's so

358
00:16:15,270 --> 00:16:17,550
long ago I can only say about 15 years

359
00:16:17,550 --> 00:16:20,940
so I think the team to look at is the

360
00:16:20,940 --> 00:16:23,070
Seattle Seahawks and the Legion of boom

361
00:16:23,070 --> 00:16:25,380
I some of you all know the Legion of

362
00:16:25,380 --> 00:16:26,460
boom B in the name of the Seattle

363
00:16:26,460 --> 00:16:28,860
Seahawks defense from 2011 to 2015

364
00:16:28,860 --> 00:16:31,170
looked at their players Sherman Thomas

365
00:16:31,170 --> 00:16:34,860
Charles left but really the philosophy

366
00:16:34,860 --> 00:16:38,070
and way of and methodology of everyone

367
00:16:38,070 --> 00:16:42,300
on that defense there's all sorts of

368
00:16:42,300 --> 00:16:44,100
sports arguments as to why that's the

369
00:16:44,100 --> 00:16:44,580
case

370
00:16:44,580 --> 00:16:46,530
in this city of all cities I would hope

371
00:16:46,530 --> 00:16:48,480
I don't need to go with statistics and

372
00:16:48,480 --> 00:16:51,240
why the team was impressive but the most

373
00:16:51,240 --> 00:16:53,160
important one is for four years straight

374
00:16:53,160 --> 00:16:55,590
they did what a defense is meant to do

375
00:16:55,590 --> 00:16:58,260
they led the league in stopping the

376
00:16:58,260 --> 00:17:02,790
opponent's scoring so what can we learn

377
00:17:02,790 --> 00:17:05,459
what lessons are there in an abstract

378
00:17:05,459 --> 00:17:07,920
way from the legion of boom and Pete

379
00:17:07,920 --> 00:17:10,619
Carroll lesson one train how you fight

380
00:17:10,619 --> 00:17:13,589
now a very abstract and high level look

381
00:17:13,589 --> 00:17:15,930
at Pete Carroll's whole methodology and

382
00:17:15,930 --> 00:17:18,240
way of thinking win forever which is

383
00:17:18,240 --> 00:17:20,400
what we want to do in cybersecurity one

384
00:17:20,400 --> 00:17:22,939
of the main parts of that is practice is

385
00:17:22,939 --> 00:17:26,369
everything now as you know as I say a

386
00:17:26,369 --> 00:17:29,220
team is so big you've got first string

387
00:17:29,220 --> 00:17:31,320
and second string players that means

388
00:17:31,320 --> 00:17:32,910
when you practice for example if you're

389
00:17:32,910 --> 00:17:34,590
about to play the New Orleans Saints on

390
00:17:34,590 --> 00:17:37,080
Sunday with or without Drew Brees for

391
00:17:37,080 --> 00:17:39,000
the sounds of it your second string

392
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:40,830
defense can imitate the defense you're

393
00:17:40,830 --> 00:17:42,420
going to play on Sunday your second

394
00:17:42,420 --> 00:17:44,130
string offense can ever take the offense

395
00:17:44,130 --> 00:17:46,590
you play on Sunday so but the tie might

396
00:17:46,590 --> 00:17:48,090
you play the New Orleans Saints on

397
00:17:48,090 --> 00:17:50,520
Sunday actually you've been playing them

398
00:17:50,520 --> 00:17:54,480
all week so you're at a better state to

399
00:17:54,480 --> 00:17:57,360
play them when it matters now this links

400
00:17:57,360 --> 00:17:58,830
to a wargaming concept called the

401
00:17:58,830 --> 00:18:01,920
Caffrey triangle named after its creator

402
00:18:01,920 --> 00:18:05,280
Mack Caffrey what happens in military

403
00:18:05,280 --> 00:18:09,720
exercises is you tend to have the red

404
00:18:09,720 --> 00:18:12,179
team the OP for the opposition force in

405
00:18:12,179 --> 00:18:13,080
any military X

406
00:18:13,080 --> 00:18:15,540
sighs tends to be down here stimulate

407
00:18:15,540 --> 00:18:17,970
the game objectives don't make it look

408
00:18:17,970 --> 00:18:19,980
bad that we just spent however bill

409
00:18:19,980 --> 00:18:21,600
however many billion dollars on an

410
00:18:21,600 --> 00:18:24,270
aircraft carrier make it look good just

411
00:18:24,270 --> 00:18:27,600
fall over when the gun goes bang as you

412
00:18:27,600 --> 00:18:28,830
know if you've worked with penetration

413
00:18:28,830 --> 00:18:31,110
testers in cybersecurity they tend to be

414
00:18:31,110 --> 00:18:33,450
up here when are all costs they will

415
00:18:33,450 --> 00:18:35,250
break into your systems in the best way

416
00:18:35,250 --> 00:18:37,200
they can think I'll fit in their toolset

417
00:18:37,200 --> 00:18:40,410
which is fine except that pen test team

418
00:18:40,410 --> 00:18:43,770
is not your adversary the way it should

419
00:18:43,770 --> 00:18:46,260
be in any practice the idea of the scout

420
00:18:46,260 --> 00:18:50,490
team down here followed doctoring you're

421
00:18:50,490 --> 00:18:53,100
you're the attackers you pay for the red

422
00:18:53,100 --> 00:18:55,020
team the OPFOR and an exercise the

423
00:18:55,020 --> 00:18:57,630
penetration testers should imitate the

424
00:18:57,630 --> 00:18:59,820
attackers you're actually up against now

425
00:18:59,820 --> 00:19:02,610
if you're on a less um moving away from

426
00:19:02,610 --> 00:19:05,330
wargaming the same idea comes in to

427
00:19:05,330 --> 00:19:07,770
cyber security look at this presentation

428
00:19:07,770 --> 00:19:10,440
from 2018 we're on the wall by burger

429
00:19:10,440 --> 00:19:12,150
man and sweets they cover the same thing

430
00:19:12,150 --> 00:19:13,620
but they use a quadrant rather than a

431
00:19:13,620 --> 00:19:16,560
triangle and this whole theory of how

432
00:19:16,560 --> 00:19:18,930
you imitate opponents there's all sorts

433
00:19:18,930 --> 00:19:21,650
of links on this there's far too many

434
00:19:21,650 --> 00:19:24,300
well they're far too many tabs open far

435
00:19:24,300 --> 00:19:26,370
too many references I could use but the

436
00:19:26,370 --> 00:19:28,290
one analogy that sticks and works is

437
00:19:28,290 --> 00:19:30,030
that of a sparring partner

438
00:19:30,030 --> 00:19:32,820
when I say boxer a boxers trainer when

439
00:19:32,820 --> 00:19:34,530
you use a sparring partner you don't use

440
00:19:34,530 --> 00:19:36,150
the sparring partner to beat up your

441
00:19:36,150 --> 00:19:38,340
boxer you use up that use the sparring

442
00:19:38,340 --> 00:19:40,680
partner to make your boxer better that's

443
00:19:40,680 --> 00:19:41,640
the whole point

444
00:19:41,640 --> 00:19:44,400
of every security test anything you run

445
00:19:44,400 --> 00:19:48,480
and B goes as per Adams and you need to

446
00:19:48,480 --> 00:19:50,160
do it as early as possible as per anum

447
00:19:50,160 --> 00:19:51,810
show sex presentation back in Brooklyn

448
00:19:51,810 --> 00:19:55,410
Oh six you don't want to threat model

449
00:19:55,410 --> 00:19:57,150
when the x-wings are going down the

450
00:19:57,150 --> 00:20:00,150
trench do it as early as possible in

451
00:20:00,150 --> 00:20:02,280
that process I don't need to explain

452
00:20:02,280 --> 00:20:04,440
shift left I think to anyone in this

453
00:20:04,440 --> 00:20:06,960
room if you want a good presentation on

454
00:20:06,960 --> 00:20:09,210
this especially the kind of speed and

455
00:20:09,210 --> 00:20:11,610
scale that you need to implement within

456
00:20:11,610 --> 00:20:13,680
your CI CD pipelines this presentation

457
00:20:13,680 --> 00:20:17,010
from deficit con 2018 in London by

458
00:20:17,010 --> 00:20:18,930
Stewart winter tear is worth watching of

459
00:20:18,930 --> 00:20:20,970
course for tools the first thing you

460
00:20:20,970 --> 00:20:23,640
should look at is Olaf's app if you're

461
00:20:23,640 --> 00:20:26,880
lucky enough that your infrastructure in

462
00:20:26,880 --> 00:20:27,070
that

463
00:20:27,070 --> 00:20:29,230
education is all code because it's

464
00:20:29,230 --> 00:20:30,580
modern enough that everything is code

465
00:20:30,580 --> 00:20:32,860
look at threat model in his code look at

466
00:20:32,860 --> 00:20:37,899
threats beg bye Fraser Scott it's worth

467
00:20:37,899 --> 00:20:40,409
looking at and the reason you do this as

468
00:20:40,409 --> 00:20:44,679
per the NFL scout team you know roughly

469
00:20:44,679 --> 00:20:46,000
who you're up against and you've got

470
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:47,950
limited resources you can't defend

471
00:20:47,950 --> 00:20:49,809
against everything you can't be ready to

472
00:20:49,809 --> 00:20:51,940
protect yourself against everyone and

473
00:20:51,940 --> 00:20:53,649
this is something that they realized in

474
00:20:53,649 --> 00:20:55,419
the military there's an excellent report

475
00:20:55,419 --> 00:20:59,110
in 1990 from 1991 by Rand called the

476
00:20:59,110 --> 00:21:04,029
base of sand problem full of basically

477
00:21:04,029 --> 00:21:05,470
they looked at military modeling they

478
00:21:05,470 --> 00:21:06,789
looked at wargaming they look to

479
00:21:06,789 --> 00:21:09,129
military simulations and realized they

480
00:21:09,129 --> 00:21:11,200
were doing it wrong spending billions of

481
00:21:11,200 --> 00:21:14,259
dollars unnecessarily and cost in lives

482
00:21:14,259 --> 00:21:15,940
because they were analyzing the

483
00:21:15,940 --> 00:21:18,340
situation in the wrong way as per this

484
00:21:18,340 --> 00:21:20,889
footnote particularly struck me battle

485
00:21:20,889 --> 00:21:22,539
outcomes have historically borne no

486
00:21:22,539 --> 00:21:25,090
relationship to the raw force ratio it's

487
00:21:25,090 --> 00:21:26,740
not just who's got the biggest tanks or

488
00:21:26,740 --> 00:21:28,419
the most tanks or the biggest

489
00:21:28,419 --> 00:21:30,309
helicopters or the most soldiers or the

490
00:21:30,309 --> 00:21:32,980
best weapons or the most bullets what

491
00:21:32,980 --> 00:21:35,889
matters is the ratio of effective forces

492
00:21:35,889 --> 00:21:38,200
it's how many people you actually bring

493
00:21:38,200 --> 00:21:40,750
to the point of attack that's important

494
00:21:40,750 --> 00:21:42,399
and that's the lesson so one of the

495
00:21:42,399 --> 00:21:44,559
lessons to take away from the MP Cowell

496
00:21:44,559 --> 00:21:46,509
and the idea of the scout team practice

497
00:21:46,509 --> 00:21:49,389
is everything next lesson eliminate the

498
00:21:49,389 --> 00:21:51,879
big play now for some of you I could

499
00:21:51,879 --> 00:21:53,440
probably introduce you to the way the

500
00:21:53,440 --> 00:21:54,909
Legion have been played which is a cover

501
00:21:54,909 --> 00:21:56,860
three with a single high free safety

502
00:21:56,860 --> 00:21:58,750
some of you around the room I expect

503
00:21:58,750 --> 00:22:00,879
could explain this a lot more about this

504
00:22:00,879 --> 00:22:04,480
to me than I know we don't need to

505
00:22:04,480 --> 00:22:05,799
thankfully we don't need to get into the

506
00:22:05,799 --> 00:22:07,990
detail the basics is if you look at a

507
00:22:07,990 --> 00:22:11,200
typical set up San Francisco 49ers an

508
00:22:11,200 --> 00:22:12,850
offense with the ball settle Seahawks on

509
00:22:12,850 --> 00:22:14,950
defense without the ball traditionally

510
00:22:14,950 --> 00:22:17,289
NFL defenses have emphasized the

511
00:22:17,289 --> 00:22:20,289
defensive line the biggest players close

512
00:22:20,289 --> 00:22:22,029
to the ball close to the opponents it

513
00:22:22,029 --> 00:22:24,309
makes sense what Pete Carroll did was

514
00:22:24,309 --> 00:22:26,129
emphasize the linebackers and especially

515
00:22:26,129 --> 00:22:29,649
the defensive backs and especially an

516
00:22:29,649 --> 00:22:31,389
apologist to any Seahawks fans in the

517
00:22:31,389 --> 00:22:33,399
audience now a play with the Baltimore

518
00:22:33,399 --> 00:22:37,120
Ravens Earl Thomas the free safety it's

519
00:22:37,120 --> 00:22:39,100
the last line of defense that's most

520
00:22:39,100 --> 00:22:40,260
important

521
00:22:40,260 --> 00:22:42,550
and that's the position Cowell used to

522
00:22:42,550 --> 00:22:44,770
play in college the reason he does this

523
00:22:44,770 --> 00:22:48,370
is because the NFL you you can gain

524
00:22:48,370 --> 00:22:49,840
yards but you curtain you don't

525
00:22:49,840 --> 00:22:52,420
necessarily score points as long as you

526
00:22:52,420 --> 00:22:54,760
stop your opponent scoring points those

527
00:22:54,760 --> 00:22:57,940
yards don't actually matter in the same

528
00:22:57,940 --> 00:23:01,480
way to take a slide from Adrien Sanabria

529
00:23:01,480 --> 00:23:04,450
presentation at RFC 2018 the way we

530
00:23:04,450 --> 00:23:06,160
think about cyber Security's that's it

531
00:23:06,160 --> 00:23:09,510
you get hacked and you're done

532
00:23:09,510 --> 00:23:12,790
game over when actually you've got the

533
00:23:12,790 --> 00:23:14,170
whole cyber kill chain you've got a

534
00:23:14,170 --> 00:23:16,180
whole set of steps that a tech has to go

535
00:23:16,180 --> 00:23:18,550
through before achieving actions and

536
00:23:18,550 --> 00:23:23,200
objectives so you've got if you see it

537
00:23:23,200 --> 00:23:24,790
the right way all these points where you

538
00:23:24,790 --> 00:23:26,770
can stop an opponent come from

539
00:23:26,770 --> 00:23:28,750
compromising your systems now it depends

540
00:23:28,750 --> 00:23:29,830
what you use had a really great

541
00:23:29,830 --> 00:23:32,230
conversation over lunch about IOT about

542
00:23:32,230 --> 00:23:35,980
cyber physical if someone breaks into

543
00:23:35,980 --> 00:23:38,890
your furnace and sets it to hot so it

544
00:23:38,890 --> 00:23:42,400
literally explodes it's too late you

545
00:23:42,400 --> 00:23:44,080
can't recover but for some of you the

546
00:23:44,080 --> 00:23:46,510
systems you use the things you build the

547
00:23:46,510 --> 00:23:48,760
whole five functions five core functions

548
00:23:48,760 --> 00:23:50,680
of the NIST cybersecurity framework are

549
00:23:50,680 --> 00:23:53,470
appropriate you can respond and recover

550
00:23:53,470 --> 00:23:55,570
you can have a detect that's better than

551
00:23:55,570 --> 00:23:58,900
the months there is on average and still

552
00:23:58,900 --> 00:24:01,570
that breach doesn't matter the opponent

553
00:24:01,570 --> 00:24:03,490
has gained yards but they haven't scored

554
00:24:03,490 --> 00:24:06,070
in the same way there's a great press

555
00:24:06,070 --> 00:24:08,110
this great series of presentations by

556
00:24:08,110 --> 00:24:11,590
son Lu he's been given out RSA where

557
00:24:11,590 --> 00:24:13,570
he's looked at those five columns of the

558
00:24:13,570 --> 00:24:16,660
NIST the core nice functions a map where

559
00:24:16,660 --> 00:24:19,180
products tend to fit where vendors are

560
00:24:19,180 --> 00:24:21,760
selling you things you can use related

561
00:24:21,760 --> 00:24:24,100
to those five core functions and that's

562
00:24:24,100 --> 00:24:26,500
where you're compromised you can see how

563
00:24:26,500 --> 00:24:27,910
much emphasis there is on products

564
00:24:27,910 --> 00:24:30,430
before you're compromised rather than

565
00:24:30,430 --> 00:24:32,560
how little there is after especially and

566
00:24:32,560 --> 00:24:34,540
this is slightly out of date but

567
00:24:34,540 --> 00:24:36,700
especially considering so many of you

568
00:24:36,700 --> 00:24:40,240
work with applications that gap there so

569
00:24:40,240 --> 00:24:42,130
once your application is compromised

570
00:24:42,130 --> 00:24:43,810
that's it there's no way to detect

571
00:24:43,810 --> 00:24:46,650
respond or recover their race there are

572
00:24:46,650 --> 00:24:50,140
products in this space but that's where

573
00:24:50,140 --> 00:24:52,450
you should look because your application

574
00:24:52,450 --> 00:24:53,090
can be

575
00:24:53,090 --> 00:24:55,340
zillions and yet still occasionally be

576
00:24:55,340 --> 00:24:57,040
vulnerable occasionally be compromised

577
00:24:57,040 --> 00:24:59,480
if you want to look at the whole concept

578
00:24:59,480 --> 00:25:01,040
of cyber resilience I'd recommend this

579
00:25:01,040 --> 00:25:03,920
blog by Phil Huggins the blog title his

580
00:25:03,920 --> 00:25:05,990
blog title rather is Black Swan security

581
00:25:05,990 --> 00:25:07,460
not related to the company of the same

582
00:25:07,460 --> 00:25:10,280
name for these concepts the three points

583
00:25:10,280 --> 00:25:13,330
that really stick out for me

584
00:25:13,930 --> 00:25:16,610
it's experiential learning and threat

585
00:25:16,610 --> 00:25:18,290
simulation which fits in with the scout

586
00:25:18,290 --> 00:25:20,660
team idea situational awareness and

587
00:25:20,660 --> 00:25:23,240
especially the pace of decision-making

588
00:25:23,240 --> 00:25:26,270
which a long line had got across that

589
00:25:26,270 --> 00:25:28,700
investigation wall brings us to John

590
00:25:28,700 --> 00:25:30,200
Colonel John Boyd of the United States

591
00:25:30,200 --> 00:25:33,380
Air Force now he was a pilot in the

592
00:25:33,380 --> 00:25:35,090
Korean War the Vietnam War in the 50s

593
00:25:35,090 --> 00:25:40,400
and 60s advocated speed over might over

594
00:25:40,400 --> 00:25:44,000
force in air combat realized that that's

595
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:47,390
the way you win that kind of complex

596
00:25:47,390 --> 00:25:50,090
conflict and from there extrapolated

597
00:25:50,090 --> 00:25:52,760
that's how you win any kind of complex

598
00:25:52,760 --> 00:25:54,680
conflict you make better decisions

599
00:25:54,680 --> 00:25:57,260
faster than your opponent it's not that

600
00:25:57,260 --> 00:26:00,410
just have the biggest force you can that

601
00:26:00,410 --> 00:26:03,500
does not work though he introduced the

602
00:26:03,500 --> 00:26:05,240
OODA loop which there's a lot of

603
00:26:05,240 --> 00:26:07,240
material and I've read relatively little

604
00:26:07,240 --> 00:26:10,310
the usually observe orient decide act

605
00:26:10,310 --> 00:26:12,620
you start at the top you observe the

606
00:26:12,620 --> 00:26:14,150
situation you're in and where your

607
00:26:14,150 --> 00:26:16,250
opponent is you then orient yourself in

608
00:26:16,250 --> 00:26:17,600
relation to your opponent you then

609
00:26:17,600 --> 00:26:20,180
decide the best action to take in order

610
00:26:20,180 --> 00:26:21,890
for you to defeat your opponent you then

611
00:26:21,890 --> 00:26:24,440
carry out the action and you go around

612
00:26:24,440 --> 00:26:25,940
that loop and you go around that loop

613
00:26:25,940 --> 00:26:29,980
faster than your opponent is how you win

614
00:26:29,980 --> 00:26:33,200
complex conflicts which is exactly the

615
00:26:33,200 --> 00:26:34,910
kind of conflict we're in in

616
00:26:34,910 --> 00:26:38,630
cybersecurity now this was back in the

617
00:26:38,630 --> 00:26:40,700
60s and 70s the military is still

618
00:26:40,700 --> 00:26:43,280
figuring out how to do this I was at the

619
00:26:43,280 --> 00:26:44,990
Commission's wargaming conference at

620
00:26:44,990 --> 00:26:46,490
King's College London a couple of weeks

621
00:26:46,490 --> 00:26:48,800
ago there was a great presentation there

622
00:26:48,800 --> 00:26:50,390
by captain Phil Matt Larry of the

623
00:26:50,390 --> 00:26:53,870
Norwegian military now he because the

624
00:26:53,870 --> 00:26:55,670
modern way of fighting so complex

625
00:26:55,670 --> 00:26:57,980
he gave this presentation on the use of

626
00:26:57,980 --> 00:27:00,830
war games as pedagogy how to teach

627
00:27:00,830 --> 00:27:04,850
people how to understand the concepts

628
00:27:04,850 --> 00:27:06,560
they need how to become better

629
00:27:06,560 --> 00:27:08,720
strategic thinkers and he of course

630
00:27:08,720 --> 00:27:10,660
covered the u de Loup as well in this

631
00:27:10,660 --> 00:27:13,100
because the you have so because the u de

632
00:27:13,100 --> 00:27:15,230
Loup relates to maneuver warfare as

633
00:27:15,230 --> 00:27:16,670
opposed the old way of fighting the old

634
00:27:16,670 --> 00:27:18,560
way of fighting is this attrition

635
00:27:18,560 --> 00:27:21,680
warfare you just kill more of your enemy

636
00:27:21,680 --> 00:27:23,270
than they kill of you the classic

637
00:27:23,270 --> 00:27:25,880
styling quote of quantity has a quality

638
00:27:25,880 --> 00:27:29,510
all of its own which is as discussed in

639
00:27:29,510 --> 00:27:30,830
presentations this morning what you're

640
00:27:30,830 --> 00:27:32,930
just all of your code will always be

641
00:27:32,930 --> 00:27:36,080
secure you'll cover all possible

642
00:27:36,080 --> 00:27:37,490
vulnerabilities you'll think of

643
00:27:37,490 --> 00:27:42,260
everything that kind of mentality does

644
00:27:42,260 --> 00:27:44,600
not work in modern complex conflicts

645
00:27:44,600 --> 00:27:46,580
which is what we're all in what we have

646
00:27:46,580 --> 00:27:48,530
to think of is something like the idea

647
00:27:48,530 --> 00:27:50,360
of maneuver warfare as you can see there

648
00:27:50,360 --> 00:27:52,520
were this slide that captain Mac Larry

649
00:27:52,520 --> 00:27:54,770
kindly provided to me is current

650
00:27:54,770 --> 00:27:57,140
doctrine in US Marine Corps Norwegian

651
00:27:57,140 --> 00:27:59,450
army native Richards army and so on you

652
00:27:59,450 --> 00:28:01,700
see at the bottom if you're red you go

653
00:28:01,700 --> 00:28:03,770
through that order process quicker than

654
00:28:03,770 --> 00:28:06,770
your opponent by the end of going

655
00:28:06,770 --> 00:28:08,600
through it there is a decision like you

656
00:28:08,600 --> 00:28:11,510
have executed what they call collapse in

657
00:28:11,510 --> 00:28:13,460
the you de loop you are making decisions

658
00:28:13,460 --> 00:28:15,920
so fast your opponent is just watching

659
00:28:15,920 --> 00:28:17,570
you make decisions and can't keep up

660
00:28:17,570 --> 00:28:20,240
that's what you should aim for now

661
00:28:20,240 --> 00:28:22,280
getting into like attrition versus

662
00:28:22,280 --> 00:28:24,470
maneuver warfare stretching this analogy

663
00:28:24,470 --> 00:28:27,380
there are so many things I could go into

664
00:28:27,380 --> 00:28:28,910
there are so many things I need to read

665
00:28:28,910 --> 00:28:32,840
and then go into but to keep it simple

666
00:28:32,840 --> 00:28:36,560
as I say it's the you de loop go around

667
00:28:36,560 --> 00:28:37,930
to you de loop faster than your opponent

668
00:28:37,930 --> 00:28:40,790
you'll win a complex conflict however we

669
00:28:40,790 --> 00:28:41,540
have a problem

670
00:28:41,540 --> 00:28:44,420
the attacker always goes first they

671
00:28:44,420 --> 00:28:46,280
start going around their loop then at

672
00:28:46,280 --> 00:28:47,810
some point we detect we're being

673
00:28:47,810 --> 00:28:50,750
attacked and we start arey de loop so

674
00:28:50,750 --> 00:28:53,180
you're in a race where you always start

675
00:28:53,180 --> 00:28:58,640
behind so how how do you deal with that

676
00:28:58,640 --> 00:29:00,620
how do you win a race when your

677
00:29:00,620 --> 00:29:02,900
attackers always go first which brings

678
00:29:02,900 --> 00:29:04,550
me to the last lesson that we can get

679
00:29:04,550 --> 00:29:05,960
from Pete Carroll and the Legion of boom

680
00:29:05,960 --> 00:29:11,090
out hit your opponent now going back to

681
00:29:11,090 --> 00:29:13,550
that Rand paper from 1991 as you can see

682
00:29:13,550 --> 00:29:14,460
there

683
00:29:14,460 --> 00:29:16,559
the evidence of history is that soft

684
00:29:16,559 --> 00:29:18,600
factors command control processes

685
00:29:18,600 --> 00:29:21,769
tactics and strategy are first-order

686
00:29:21,769 --> 00:29:24,570
determinants of deterrents and war

687
00:29:24,570 --> 00:29:28,919
outcomes not force not size the way you

688
00:29:28,919 --> 00:29:31,289
fight the strategy you use decides

689
00:29:31,289 --> 00:29:33,269
whether you win or not but from their

690
00:29:33,269 --> 00:29:35,519
study of literally thousands of years of

691
00:29:35,519 --> 00:29:39,990
history so as I say we look to the

692
00:29:39,990 --> 00:29:41,909
Legion of boom for this looks those

693
00:29:41,909 --> 00:29:44,299
three members I mentioned Sherman Thomas

694
00:29:44,299 --> 00:29:47,220
Chancellor and looks the way the Seattle

695
00:29:47,220 --> 00:29:49,710
Seahawks played if you're familiar with

696
00:29:49,710 --> 00:29:51,259
the Seahawks in this tackling video

697
00:29:51,259 --> 00:29:53,399
Seahawks have a tackling technique

698
00:29:53,399 --> 00:29:55,499
called the shoulder punch it's literally

699
00:29:55,499 --> 00:29:56,730
that you hit your opponent with your

700
00:29:56,730 --> 00:29:58,919
shoulder usually Sherman coming in from

701
00:29:58,919 --> 00:29:59,429
the left

702
00:29:59,429 --> 00:30:01,710
you can push Jared Goff out of bounds or

703
00:30:01,710 --> 00:30:03,179
you can hit him out of bounds it's

704
00:30:03,179 --> 00:30:05,580
medically defined as a collision sport

705
00:30:05,580 --> 00:30:08,369
make an impact you'll see all Thomas

706
00:30:08,369 --> 00:30:10,019
coming in from the right aisle Thomas is

707
00:30:10,019 --> 00:30:12,840
510 200 pounds the guy getting up from

708
00:30:12,840 --> 00:30:15,299
the ground he's now retired tight end

709
00:30:15,299 --> 00:30:18,330
Rob Gronkowski 6 for a 270 if I remember

710
00:30:18,330 --> 00:30:20,879
rightly the application of the force you

711
00:30:20,879 --> 00:30:22,830
have correctly it's not be in the

712
00:30:22,830 --> 00:30:25,769
biggest but as Seahawks fans will know

713
00:30:25,769 --> 00:30:27,210
if we're going to cover the shoulder

714
00:30:27,210 --> 00:30:29,399
punch I need you to introduce you to the

715
00:30:29,399 --> 00:30:32,299
highlight reel of Cam bamm-bamm

716
00:30:32,299 --> 00:30:42,740
Chancellor and this is why

717
00:30:42,740 --> 00:30:47,720
a breach is not an incident it's not

718
00:30:47,720 --> 00:30:51,860
like a fire it's not like a flood it's

719
00:30:51,860 --> 00:30:56,270
not like an earthquake a breach is an

720
00:30:56,270 --> 00:31:02,750
attack an attack by a human adversary

721
00:31:02,750 --> 00:31:12,760
with their own weaknesses you are not

722
00:31:12,760 --> 00:31:18,470
playing dogs what cam Chancellor did

723
00:31:18,470 --> 00:31:20,870
what the Legion of boom did what the

724
00:31:20,870 --> 00:31:22,760
Seattle Seahawks did the way they were

725
00:31:22,760 --> 00:31:26,090
always described they set the tone of

726
00:31:26,090 --> 00:31:28,970
the game you will gain yards against the

727
00:31:28,970 --> 00:31:30,830
legion of boom you will score points

728
00:31:30,830 --> 00:31:33,049
against the leading of boom but it will

729
00:31:33,049 --> 00:31:36,980
hurt every time you try succeed or fail

730
00:31:36,980 --> 00:31:40,190
and that had an impact in the way

731
00:31:40,190 --> 00:31:42,650
opponents play

732
00:31:42,650 --> 00:31:46,150
[Applause]

733
00:31:46,150 --> 00:31:48,770
it's that it's this is gonna hurt and

734
00:31:48,770 --> 00:31:51,260
it's gonna hurt for the entire game as

735
00:31:51,260 --> 00:31:53,360
Richard Sherman said of Chancellor he

736
00:31:53,360 --> 00:31:56,810
damages people's souls if you're in a

737
00:31:56,810 --> 00:31:58,910
conflict with an opponent you want to

738
00:31:58,910 --> 00:32:01,310
have an effect on that opponent there's

739
00:32:01,310 --> 00:32:03,020
a great article last year written about

740
00:32:03,020 --> 00:32:04,340
the Legion of boom by the bleacher

741
00:32:04,340 --> 00:32:07,340
report what made them horrifying was

742
00:32:07,340 --> 00:32:09,590
they blend out of belligerence

743
00:32:09,590 --> 00:32:12,440
and violence unmatched in its era and

744
00:32:12,440 --> 00:32:14,660
that belligerence is the thing i think

745
00:32:14,660 --> 00:32:17,300
we're missing in cybersecurity if you

746
00:32:17,300 --> 00:32:18,860
look at incident response the way we

747
00:32:18,860 --> 00:32:20,840
deal with instance it's based roughly on

748
00:32:20,840 --> 00:32:22,250
the Met Police model you assign

749
00:32:22,250 --> 00:32:23,930
commanders at different levels of

750
00:32:23,930 --> 00:32:26,930
operational tactical or strategy you

751
00:32:26,930 --> 00:32:29,150
then deal with the incident the incident

752
00:32:29,150 --> 00:32:32,900
is then dealt with cyber security

753
00:32:32,900 --> 00:32:35,660
attacks are not incident like I say this

754
00:32:35,660 --> 00:32:38,600
is not a fire or a flood they usually at

755
00:32:38,600 --> 00:32:40,370
this point I relate this to David

756
00:32:40,370 --> 00:32:43,850
Bianco's pyramid of pain inflict pain on

757
00:32:43,850 --> 00:32:47,000
your opponent make them think twice but

758
00:32:47,000 --> 00:32:49,220
the actions they're taking about the

759
00:32:49,220 --> 00:32:50,840
decisions they're making the difference

760
00:32:50,840 --> 00:32:52,970
between you know the hash values of the

761
00:32:52,970 --> 00:32:54,710
malware they're using they'll write new

762
00:32:54,710 --> 00:32:57,140
malware and change the hash value you

763
00:32:57,140 --> 00:32:59,330
figure out their TTP's their tools

764
00:32:59,330 --> 00:33:01,250
techniques and procedures they're going

765
00:33:01,250 --> 00:33:04,490
to change the entire way they work but

766
00:33:04,490 --> 00:33:05,930
there's more to this and this is where

767
00:33:05,930 --> 00:33:07,580
they should be the Big Finish and I

768
00:33:07,580 --> 00:33:10,430
should give you some answers but all

769
00:33:10,430 --> 00:33:13,040
I've got is some seedlings but it's that

770
00:33:13,040 --> 00:33:14,630
we involved in a conflict with adversity

771
00:33:14,630 --> 00:33:16,240
this there's something about

772
00:33:16,240 --> 00:33:18,110
counter-attacking it's a long line

773
00:33:18,110 --> 00:33:21,770
against the investigation wall chess if

774
00:33:21,770 --> 00:33:24,130
you look at chess look at madness

775
00:33:24,130 --> 00:33:28,100
Carlsen almost beat Kasparov at 13

776
00:33:28,100 --> 00:33:29,510
there's lots of Statistics all you need

777
00:33:29,510 --> 00:33:31,310
to know he's number one ranked in the

778
00:33:31,310 --> 00:33:33,920
world you read about the way he plays

779
00:33:33,920 --> 00:33:37,610
his strategy positional not tactical

780
00:33:37,610 --> 00:33:40,880
he's thinking in the longer term he

781
00:33:40,880 --> 00:33:43,700
exhausts opponents he just weighs them

782
00:33:43,700 --> 00:33:46,940
down and the word used to describe him

783
00:33:46,940 --> 00:33:50,060
is nettlesome this nettlesome ness being

784
00:33:50,060 --> 00:33:52,490
defined and which can be measured

785
00:33:52,490 --> 00:33:54,170
through chess analytics

786
00:33:54,170 --> 00:33:56,990
the ability to make opponents make

787
00:33:56,990 --> 00:34:00,170
mistakes which I don't think we have in

788
00:34:00,170 --> 00:34:01,910
cybersecurity it's like golf well I'll

789
00:34:01,910 --> 00:34:03,620
just be better than you I'll be more

790
00:34:03,620 --> 00:34:05,540
secure than attackers I'll know more as

791
00:34:05,540 --> 00:34:07,580
a penetration tester than the hack is

792
00:34:07,580 --> 00:34:08,989
trying to get into your network

793
00:34:08,989 --> 00:34:12,050
there's no nettlesome this there another

794
00:34:12,050 --> 00:34:14,000
long line across the investigation wall

795
00:34:14,000 --> 00:34:16,040
you look at your clock current manager

796
00:34:16,040 --> 00:34:18,110
of Liverpool Football Club soccer in the

797
00:34:18,110 --> 00:34:23,000
UK loads of victories both as manager of

798
00:34:23,000 --> 00:34:26,139
Dortmund and then manager of Liverpool

799
00:34:26,139 --> 00:34:28,810
thing you need to know is his main

800
00:34:28,810 --> 00:34:32,030
strategy is called gegen pressin I think

801
00:34:32,030 --> 00:34:33,620
sort of manipulated into the British

802
00:34:33,620 --> 00:34:36,290
British gig and pressing it's basically

803
00:34:36,290 --> 00:34:38,110
like the full-court press in basketball

804
00:34:38,110 --> 00:34:41,090
as soon as the opponent has the ball and

805
00:34:41,090 --> 00:34:42,770
especially if the opponent has gained

806
00:34:42,770 --> 00:34:44,960
the ball from you you go to get it back

807
00:34:44,960 --> 00:34:47,270
you don't make sure all your teammates

808
00:34:47,270 --> 00:34:49,070
are in position you don't make sure

809
00:34:49,070 --> 00:34:51,260
you're ready to defend you just go get

810
00:34:51,260 --> 00:34:53,060
the ball back so as soon as your

811
00:34:53,060 --> 00:34:54,710
opponent has the ball they've him they

812
00:34:54,710 --> 00:34:57,170
immediately know that I immediately

813
00:34:57,170 --> 00:34:59,990
going to be under attack it forces they

814
00:34:59,990 --> 00:35:02,270
Ruda leave so much faster than everybody

815
00:35:02,270 --> 00:35:03,530
sort of gets to start from a new

816
00:35:03,530 --> 00:35:05,200
position

817
00:35:05,200 --> 00:35:07,190
another long line against the wall

818
00:35:07,190 --> 00:35:10,550
across the investigation wall this of

819
00:35:10,550 --> 00:35:14,240
course brings us to Tekken if you're

820
00:35:14,240 --> 00:35:16,790
familiar with Tekken you know it's

821
00:35:16,790 --> 00:35:19,880
basically a one-on-one fighting game you

822
00:35:19,880 --> 00:35:21,980
take her controller represent one of the

823
00:35:21,980 --> 00:35:24,530
players you have to hit someone you have

824
00:35:24,530 --> 00:35:26,030
to get your opponent more than they hit

825
00:35:26,030 --> 00:35:30,020
you look at Tekken look at ours and ash

826
00:35:30,020 --> 00:35:32,540
now taken the way you fight Tekken

827
00:35:32,540 --> 00:35:35,270
professionally in eSports dominated by

828
00:35:35,270 --> 00:35:37,490
these four areas these four areas

829
00:35:37,490 --> 00:35:39,200
basically the way they fight is

830
00:35:39,200 --> 00:35:41,120
aggressive it's a fighting game you just

831
00:35:41,120 --> 00:35:42,980
hit your opponent faster and quicker

832
00:35:42,980 --> 00:35:45,230
than they hit you because of visa

833
00:35:45,230 --> 00:35:47,540
problems there's also a big Tekken

834
00:35:47,540 --> 00:35:50,300
community in Pakistan and Pakistan was

835
00:35:50,300 --> 00:35:53,600
isolated now the Pakistani style of

836
00:35:53,600 --> 00:35:55,700
playing Tekken was based on something

837
00:35:55,700 --> 00:35:58,070
called the whiff punish your opponent

838
00:35:58,070 --> 00:36:00,740
makes a mistake their character will

839
00:36:00,740 --> 00:36:02,390
still be going through that punch the

840
00:36:02,390 --> 00:36:03,560
animation will still be going through

841
00:36:03,560 --> 00:36:05,780
that punch then you punish them and you

842
00:36:05,780 --> 00:36:07,370
hit them as often as you

843
00:36:07,370 --> 00:36:11,000
now they've made an error now introduce

844
00:36:11,000 --> 00:36:13,700
arson ash you after circumventing many

845
00:36:13,700 --> 00:36:16,370
visa problems literally turned up at the

846
00:36:16,370 --> 00:36:20,390
evo esports event earlier this year who

847
00:36:20,390 --> 00:36:22,340
is this guy he's not from the countries

848
00:36:22,340 --> 00:36:24,530
we know about there's great videos

849
00:36:24,530 --> 00:36:26,330
there's a long story I would encourage

850
00:36:26,330 --> 00:36:29,330
looking him up but the TLDR all you need

851
00:36:29,330 --> 00:36:31,880
to know he used space and

852
00:36:31,880 --> 00:36:32,960
counter-attacks

853
00:36:32,960 --> 00:36:35,990
he was defined by the whiff punish it's

854
00:36:35,990 --> 00:36:37,070
like a Hollywood movie

855
00:36:37,070 --> 00:36:42,050
he beat everybody not he did well not he

856
00:36:42,050 --> 00:36:45,860
was faster not he was more practiced he

857
00:36:45,860 --> 00:36:47,990
was really good but through a different

858
00:36:47,990 --> 00:36:50,630
strategy that emphasized making your

859
00:36:50,630 --> 00:36:52,850
opponent make mistakes and then punished

860
00:36:52,850 --> 00:36:54,880
them for making mistakes he'd be

861
00:36:54,880 --> 00:36:59,350
everybody you are of course thinking

862
00:36:59,350 --> 00:37:02,540
what the hell I'm here at a security

863
00:37:02,540 --> 00:37:04,910
conference Tonya's just inducted me into

864
00:37:04,910 --> 00:37:06,980
this industry some guys telling me about

865
00:37:06,980 --> 00:37:10,460
fighting games why on earth am i

866
00:37:10,460 --> 00:37:13,250
spending my time doing this I think the

867
00:37:13,250 --> 00:37:15,350
problem is it's about that effect on the

868
00:37:15,350 --> 00:37:17,870
adversary we are in a conflict with

869
00:37:17,870 --> 00:37:20,660
someone and I can have a better

870
00:37:20,660 --> 00:37:23,000
conversation and get a better analysis

871
00:37:23,000 --> 00:37:26,450
from a videogame of the effect on the

872
00:37:26,450 --> 00:37:28,460
adversary and how you respond to their

873
00:37:28,460 --> 00:37:29,960
attacks now you force them to make

874
00:37:29,960 --> 00:37:30,650
mistakes

875
00:37:30,650 --> 00:37:33,440
then I can for a multi-billion dollar

876
00:37:33,440 --> 00:37:36,340
industry and I think that's the problem

877
00:37:36,340 --> 00:37:39,050
if you also want to use analogies from

878
00:37:39,050 --> 00:37:40,310
video games to want some justification

879
00:37:40,310 --> 00:37:42,800
look at the strategy of no strategy and

880
00:37:42,800 --> 00:37:46,910
other work by airdam Elka's rely is well

881
00:37:46,910 --> 00:37:49,400
respected military analysts if you

882
00:37:49,400 --> 00:37:51,830
actually look at this then the this idea

883
00:37:51,830 --> 00:37:54,980
technically then a good project is App

884
00:37:54,980 --> 00:37:57,860
Center from OWASP Matt Pandora's covered

885
00:37:57,860 --> 00:38:00,290
this in a presentation at London deficit

886
00:38:00,290 --> 00:38:04,780
Khan last year because this is the thing

887
00:38:04,780 --> 00:38:07,610
it's all about either loops it's all

888
00:38:07,610 --> 00:38:10,460
about making better decisions faster

889
00:38:10,460 --> 00:38:12,680
than your opponent and we keep trying to

890
00:38:12,680 --> 00:38:16,460
be faster I think the key point is its

891
00:38:16,460 --> 00:38:20,090
relative speed something we forget in

892
00:38:20,090 --> 00:38:20,690
size

893
00:38:20,690 --> 00:38:23,359
purity is if you slow your opponent down

894
00:38:23,359 --> 00:38:26,030
it's much easier to make faster

895
00:38:26,030 --> 00:38:29,390
decisions than them so what lessons are

896
00:38:29,390 --> 00:38:30,560
they what lessons are those from the

897
00:38:30,560 --> 00:38:34,040
lesion of the boom legion of boom first

898
00:38:34,040 --> 00:38:35,660
lesson actually just use others less

899
00:38:35,660 --> 00:38:38,690
others lessons are sober security as

900
00:38:38,690 --> 00:38:39,920
they say has been going for like thirty

901
00:38:39,920 --> 00:38:42,319
years other areas of conflict have been

902
00:38:42,319 --> 00:38:44,630
going on for millennia there are lessons

903
00:38:44,630 --> 00:38:47,329
we can learn from them from the legion

904
00:38:47,329 --> 00:38:49,220
of boom specifically practice is

905
00:38:49,220 --> 00:38:50,660
everything the way you attack your

906
00:38:50,660 --> 00:38:52,280
applications the way you threat model

907
00:38:52,280 --> 00:38:54,650
eliminate the big play depends what

908
00:38:54,650 --> 00:38:57,500
you're running but you can be breached

909
00:38:57,500 --> 00:39:02,119
without the game being lost also out hit

910
00:39:02,119 --> 00:39:04,040
your opponent I've got half formed ideas

911
00:39:04,040 --> 00:39:06,890
I've got weird analogies I've got

912
00:39:06,890 --> 00:39:09,740
dramatic videos it all kind of makes a

913
00:39:09,740 --> 00:39:11,300
point but you're not showing you'll need

914
00:39:11,300 --> 00:39:13,130
to think about it more but think about

915
00:39:13,130 --> 00:39:14,990
it more because I don't think we have in

916
00:39:14,990 --> 00:39:19,849
the industry yet or why it was fun

917
00:39:19,849 --> 00:39:22,310
I'll give you some sites people was

918
00:39:22,310 --> 00:39:23,839
interested in that that brick came over

919
00:39:23,839 --> 00:39:25,760
and told us about the Seahawks literally

920
00:39:25,760 --> 00:39:27,380
in Seattle like we didn't know anything

921
00:39:27,380 --> 00:39:30,319
about them and keep playing like golfers

922
00:39:30,319 --> 00:39:31,970
keep practicing like golfers get the

923
00:39:31,970 --> 00:39:34,550
best tools you can be the best golfer

924
00:39:34,550 --> 00:39:38,450
you can but I think if we do that we're

925
00:39:38,450 --> 00:39:40,010
trying to be a golfer playing American

926
00:39:40,010 --> 00:39:42,040
football

927
00:39:46,120 --> 00:39:49,159
[Music]

928
00:39:53,750 --> 00:39:56,809
[Music]

929
00:40:11,660 --> 00:40:15,660
now it's funny to watch but sometimes as

930
00:40:15,660 --> 00:40:17,610
I say Tania's all inducted you into the

931
00:40:17,610 --> 00:40:19,590
profession can feel like that you're

932
00:40:19,590 --> 00:40:21,480
playing a different sport that's not the

933
00:40:21,480 --> 00:40:24,060
way to do this so I've shown you a few

934
00:40:24,060 --> 00:40:26,730
jigsaw pieces around the investigation

935
00:40:26,730 --> 00:40:28,440
wall I hope I haven't given you answers

936
00:40:28,440 --> 00:40:30,900
but I've given you something different

937
00:40:30,900 --> 00:40:34,350
to think about and a way a metaphorical

938
00:40:34,350 --> 00:40:36,050
way of looking for those answers so

939
00:40:36,050 --> 00:40:38,490
thank you for your attention and your

940
00:40:38,490 --> 00:40:48,720
time I look forward to your feedback do

941
00:40:48,720 --> 00:40:50,910
we have time for questions or a question

942
00:40:50,910 --> 00:40:53,250
we can move on if you like that's there

943
00:40:53,250 --> 00:40:54,930
I think there won't be any questions

944
00:40:54,930 --> 00:40:57,000
judging by the face from the bank so

945
00:40:57,000 --> 00:40:58,980
thank you again everyone I'll pack up my

946
00:40:58,980 --> 00:41:02,180
train get ready for the next speaker
