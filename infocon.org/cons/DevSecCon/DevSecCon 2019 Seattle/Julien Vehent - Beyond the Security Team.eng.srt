1
00:00:00,599 --> 00:00:03,120
I think it's time for our day do

2
00:00:03,120 --> 00:00:03,689
keynotes

3
00:00:03,689 --> 00:00:05,730
Julian bear hunt which is gonna speak to

4
00:00:05,730 --> 00:00:07,470
you through up to you about beyond the

5
00:00:07,470 --> 00:00:11,030
security Julian

6
00:00:15,109 --> 00:00:16,830
good morning everyone

7
00:00:16,830 --> 00:00:21,270
hi yes got a microphone and we've got

8
00:00:21,270 --> 00:00:23,189
slides fantastic day two is starting

9
00:00:23,189 --> 00:00:26,070
great already so my name is Julian you

10
00:00:26,070 --> 00:00:29,010
know I I work in the Firefox operations

11
00:00:29,010 --> 00:00:33,090
team at Mizzou I manage the team that's

12
00:00:33,090 --> 00:00:34,950
responsible for securing the backend

13
00:00:34,950 --> 00:00:37,800
infrastructure of Firefox heard of

14
00:00:37,800 --> 00:00:40,739
Firefox it's it's a browser it's very

15
00:00:40,739 --> 00:00:44,969
popular and it has most people know

16
00:00:44,969 --> 00:00:47,100
Firefox as a client applications a

17
00:00:47,100 --> 00:00:49,379
browser but it actually has a massive

18
00:00:49,379 --> 00:00:51,420
back in infrastructure with a lot of web

19
00:00:51,420 --> 00:00:55,110
api services web site a gigantic build

20
00:00:55,110 --> 00:00:57,559
infrastructure to compile the thing in

21
00:00:57,559 --> 00:01:00,840
ship updates every four to six weeks etc

22
00:01:00,840 --> 00:01:02,280
etcetera so we have to secure this

23
00:01:02,280 --> 00:01:04,589
entire environment that's what my team

24
00:01:04,589 --> 00:01:08,189
does on my spare time I'm also the

25
00:01:08,189 --> 00:01:10,560
author of a book called securing DevOps

26
00:01:10,560 --> 00:01:12,450
which scores about talks about DevOps

27
00:01:12,450 --> 00:01:14,700
and security which is somewhat relevant

28
00:01:14,700 --> 00:01:18,630
to this conference and and today what I

29
00:01:18,630 --> 00:01:22,619
wanted to do is to what we I see I see a

30
00:01:22,619 --> 00:01:24,659
change in the community a few years ago

31
00:01:24,659 --> 00:01:27,509
I were to go to a deaf Cyclops

32
00:01:27,509 --> 00:01:30,659
conference everybody would be talking

33
00:01:30,659 --> 00:01:32,880
about techniques automated testing

34
00:01:32,880 --> 00:01:37,520
integration in CI or that fun stuff and

35
00:01:37,520 --> 00:01:40,020
yesterday I heard a lot of people talk

36
00:01:40,020 --> 00:01:42,150
about culture which I think it's very

37
00:01:42,150 --> 00:01:43,950
interesting it's changed we kind of

38
00:01:43,950 --> 00:01:47,009
moved away from the pure technical

39
00:01:47,009 --> 00:01:49,229
discussions to one where we really focus

40
00:01:49,229 --> 00:01:51,810
on how to integrate security into your

41
00:01:51,810 --> 00:01:54,600
organization and I'm glad because that

42
00:01:54,600 --> 00:01:56,520
was missing when we were only talking

43
00:01:56,520 --> 00:01:58,409
about technique we were missing the

44
00:01:58,409 --> 00:02:00,060
cultural piece and with other cultural

45
00:02:00,060 --> 00:02:02,670
piece you can't do security so what I

46
00:02:02,670 --> 00:02:04,380
want to talk about today when I thought

47
00:02:04,380 --> 00:02:08,340
might be useful to share is how I built

48
00:02:08,340 --> 00:02:11,008
the obstacle team at Mozilla in the

49
00:02:11,008 --> 00:02:12,670
cloud services division storing

50
00:02:12,670 --> 00:02:14,890
there are more than four years ago and

51
00:02:14,890 --> 00:02:20,560
how we went from a small team of me to a

52
00:02:20,560 --> 00:02:23,530
team of a dozen or so people what we

53
00:02:23,530 --> 00:02:27,040
tried what worked what didn't and what I

54
00:02:27,040 --> 00:02:29,140
think is going to be important in the

55
00:02:29,140 --> 00:02:32,530
next few years so this story starts a

56
00:02:32,530 --> 00:02:37,510
few months ago and I was reviewing our

57
00:02:37,510 --> 00:02:39,550
investment our project investment for a

58
00:02:39,550 --> 00:02:42,069
meteor review of 2019 was my boss and we

59
00:02:42,069 --> 00:02:44,590
looked at where the people in my team

60
00:02:44,590 --> 00:02:46,480
were spending the time what projects

61
00:02:46,480 --> 00:02:49,900
were going to deliver more features

62
00:02:49,900 --> 00:02:51,340
throughout the second half of the year

63
00:02:51,340 --> 00:02:55,300
and he noted that we were under invested

64
00:02:55,300 --> 00:02:57,640
in infrastructure security and wonder if

65
00:02:57,640 --> 00:03:01,150
that was okay and that gave me pause I

66
00:03:01,150 --> 00:03:03,400
had to think like okay let's go through

67
00:03:03,400 --> 00:03:05,890
the security incident of the last year

68
00:03:05,890 --> 00:03:09,010
the project that the operations team is

69
00:03:09,010 --> 00:03:11,860
currently working on the secured it's

70
00:03:11,860 --> 00:03:14,170
that we did how we doing I actually

71
00:03:14,170 --> 00:03:19,150
pulled up our main metrics dashboard to

72
00:03:19,150 --> 00:03:21,340
kind of review the various metrics we

73
00:03:21,340 --> 00:03:23,370
have a processing infrastructure and

74
00:03:23,370 --> 00:03:27,010
before I could really you know load up

75
00:03:27,010 --> 00:03:29,320
that information my head ends for that

76
00:03:29,320 --> 00:03:30,790
yeah I think we're doing okay

77
00:03:30,790 --> 00:03:34,120
infrastructure security right now we may

78
00:03:34,120 --> 00:03:36,370
want to spend a little bit more time in

79
00:03:36,370 --> 00:03:39,549
other areas now what's interesting here

80
00:03:39,549 --> 00:03:41,110
is that this is drastically different

81
00:03:41,110 --> 00:03:42,700
from my investment from a few years ago

82
00:03:42,700 --> 00:03:45,190
where we were really spending most of

83
00:03:45,190 --> 00:03:47,410
our time in infrastructure security and

84
00:03:47,410 --> 00:03:50,260
in fact most of you probably spend the

85
00:03:50,260 --> 00:03:51,790
majority of your time in infrastructure

86
00:03:51,790 --> 00:03:54,340
security nowadays you're probably

87
00:03:54,340 --> 00:03:56,320
especially in traditional infrastructure

88
00:03:56,320 --> 00:03:58,239
if you manage data centers sorry about

89
00:03:58,239 --> 00:03:59,950
that but if you manage data centers

90
00:03:59,950 --> 00:04:01,000
you're probably spending a lot of time

91
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:02,410
talking about network security and

92
00:04:02,410 --> 00:04:05,019
system security and access management

93
00:04:05,019 --> 00:04:08,320
and etc etc and and we used to do that

94
00:04:08,320 --> 00:04:09,970
too we used to spend a lot of time

95
00:04:09,970 --> 00:04:13,630
securing and hardening iws accounts we

96
00:04:13,630 --> 00:04:17,200
helped the operations team figure out

97
00:04:17,200 --> 00:04:20,940
how to really update their systems

98
00:04:20,940 --> 00:04:24,080
revamp secrets management entire account

99
00:04:24,080 --> 00:04:25,849
management auditing a security group all

100
00:04:25,849 --> 00:04:27,650
of that stuff used to take a lot of

101
00:04:27,650 --> 00:04:31,819
resources for my team and and something

102
00:04:31,819 --> 00:04:35,509
interesting happened over time we built

103
00:04:35,509 --> 00:04:37,789
up these capabilities and we gave them

104
00:04:37,789 --> 00:04:40,340
to the operations team and they took

105
00:04:40,340 --> 00:04:42,770
ownership of them and they kept running

106
00:04:42,770 --> 00:04:45,860
them to security continue to improve but

107
00:04:45,860 --> 00:04:47,629
effectively the involvement of the

108
00:04:47,629 --> 00:04:51,110
security team was reducing over time the

109
00:04:51,110 --> 00:04:53,870
operations team which knows best about

110
00:04:53,870 --> 00:04:57,259
all things infrastructure was taking

111
00:04:57,259 --> 00:04:59,810
complete ownership of operation security

112
00:04:59,810 --> 00:05:02,150
effectively security was going way

113
00:05:02,150 --> 00:05:03,830
beyond the security team in the hands of

114
00:05:03,830 --> 00:05:05,870
the people who know best to secure this

115
00:05:05,870 --> 00:05:09,919
thing and I think this is a very

116
00:05:09,919 --> 00:05:13,069
interesting end result for a certainly

117
00:05:13,069 --> 00:05:16,300
one that I didn't expect a few years ago

118
00:05:16,300 --> 00:05:19,219
where it seemed that everything security

119
00:05:19,219 --> 00:05:21,229
was always going to go to the security

120
00:05:21,229 --> 00:05:24,830
team but I have advocated for some time

121
00:05:24,830 --> 00:05:27,979
that operations team are effectively the

122
00:05:27,979 --> 00:05:30,080
best security teams you can find citizen

123
00:05:30,080 --> 00:05:32,719
mints are great at security they really

124
00:05:32,719 --> 00:05:34,460
upgraded security talk to people who do

125
00:05:34,460 --> 00:05:36,650
red teaming in their organization half

126
00:05:36,650 --> 00:05:38,840
the time they get caught by the system

127
00:05:38,840 --> 00:05:40,759
mints they're really really good at it

128
00:05:40,759 --> 00:05:43,310
so you need to capitalize on them so I

129
00:05:43,310 --> 00:05:46,639
want to talk a little bit about how we

130
00:05:46,639 --> 00:05:49,129
got there and obviously it didn't use to

131
00:05:49,129 --> 00:05:52,159
be this way and let's take a step back

132
00:05:52,159 --> 00:05:55,550
before we talk about the last few years

133
00:05:55,550 --> 00:05:57,169
at Mozilla and go even further than that

134
00:05:57,169 --> 00:05:59,270
and I want to talk about how it used to

135
00:05:59,270 --> 00:06:02,509
be a decade and a half ago and most of

136
00:06:02,509 --> 00:06:05,839
you know this and it would be a painful

137
00:06:05,839 --> 00:06:08,060
reminder of how things or maybe if

138
00:06:08,060 --> 00:06:09,319
you're not lucky as things are in your

139
00:06:09,319 --> 00:06:12,589
organization but certain might be

140
00:06:12,589 --> 00:06:14,419
interesting so you may have noticed that

141
00:06:14,419 --> 00:06:17,060
I have a little bit of an accent I grew

142
00:06:17,060 --> 00:06:19,400
up in France in in cold and rainy

143
00:06:19,400 --> 00:06:21,529
normandy not unlike Seattle

144
00:06:21,529 --> 00:06:25,580
some days I studied in the Loire Valley

145
00:06:25,580 --> 00:06:29,300
and I started my career in Paris I my

146
00:06:29,300 --> 00:06:31,430
first job as a security engineer was in

147
00:06:31,430 --> 00:06:34,190
corporate banking and all the

148
00:06:34,190 --> 00:06:36,680
stereotypes were true we were

149
00:06:36,680 --> 00:06:40,190
taking long lunches drinking lots of

150
00:06:40,190 --> 00:06:43,039
wine eating lots of cheese running out

151
00:06:43,039 --> 00:06:45,080
of things to do in our eight or nine

152
00:06:45,080 --> 00:06:49,009
weeks of vacations per year etc etc it

153
00:06:49,009 --> 00:06:55,970
was it was terrible but what it's also

154
00:06:55,970 --> 00:06:57,949
true that the security team was all

155
00:06:57,949 --> 00:07:01,720
powerful in that particular environment

156
00:07:01,720 --> 00:07:04,789
nobody would do anything even remotely

157
00:07:04,789 --> 00:07:06,320
risky without clearing it with a

158
00:07:06,320 --> 00:07:07,669
security team first so this is how

159
00:07:07,669 --> 00:07:09,560
deployment used to work in this

160
00:07:09,560 --> 00:07:11,449
environment you would have developers

161
00:07:11,449 --> 00:07:14,030
and engineers who were incredibly smart

162
00:07:14,030 --> 00:07:16,300
incredibly smart about their work and

163
00:07:16,300 --> 00:07:19,039
they will design your application they

164
00:07:19,039 --> 00:07:20,349
would design a new project they will

165
00:07:20,349 --> 00:07:24,289
implement it and test it and go to the

166
00:07:24,289 --> 00:07:27,080
play the second security note just

167
00:07:27,080 --> 00:07:29,449
noticed your project and security freak

168
00:07:29,449 --> 00:07:30,770
sale what the heck is this

169
00:07:30,770 --> 00:07:32,479
who's shipping something and I don't

170
00:07:32,479 --> 00:07:34,130
know about it and it would block the

171
00:07:34,130 --> 00:07:36,919
project every single time you come and

172
00:07:36,919 --> 00:07:38,330
say how come we haven't done a review of

173
00:07:38,330 --> 00:07:40,430
this we can ship this we need you to

174
00:07:40,430 --> 00:07:42,199
look at it and oh well ok it's just a

175
00:07:42,199 --> 00:07:45,680
small API oh it's not that bad well ok

176
00:07:45,680 --> 00:07:47,510
maybe you just need one firewall rule

177
00:07:47,510 --> 00:07:48,770
are you running that on an existing

178
00:07:48,770 --> 00:07:51,830
server ok that's easy then alright fine

179
00:07:51,830 --> 00:07:55,699
you can ship does that sound familiar to

180
00:07:55,699 --> 00:08:00,979
anybody so Tanja yesterday talked about

181
00:08:00,979 --> 00:08:03,380
shifting left that's that's what it is

182
00:08:03,380 --> 00:08:06,110
right move your security towards the

183
00:08:06,110 --> 00:08:07,669
left side so you don't realize that

184
00:08:07,669 --> 00:08:09,409
something's going out at the deployment

185
00:08:09,409 --> 00:08:11,720
phase so we know it's important to do

186
00:08:11,720 --> 00:08:14,300
the question is how do you do it in

187
00:08:14,300 --> 00:08:18,949
those environments back in the day you

188
00:08:18,949 --> 00:08:20,630
had to talk to security for everything I

189
00:08:20,630 --> 00:08:23,120
remember helping developers open

190
00:08:23,120 --> 00:08:25,090
firewall rules between two points and

191
00:08:25,090 --> 00:08:27,289
security had to be involved and then

192
00:08:27,289 --> 00:08:28,820
there were three layers of project

193
00:08:28,820 --> 00:08:31,250
managers and the citizen means had to

194
00:08:31,250 --> 00:08:33,409
reference every single action in two

195
00:08:33,409 --> 00:08:34,880
different web applications for tracking

196
00:08:34,880 --> 00:08:37,909
was terrifying and you couldn't do a

197
00:08:37,909 --> 00:08:39,890
thing without talking to security not

198
00:08:39,890 --> 00:08:41,390
too long ago I was talking to a

199
00:08:41,390 --> 00:08:45,620
developer in a definitely non-defense

200
00:08:45,620 --> 00:08:48,200
organization they were saying that he

201
00:08:48,200 --> 00:08:49,680
security

202
00:08:49,680 --> 00:08:50,850
tight control of the Web Application

203
00:08:50,850 --> 00:08:52,620
Firewall that was the only way they

204
00:08:52,620 --> 00:08:54,510
could do securely because they didn't

205
00:08:54,510 --> 00:08:57,300
trust their devs so obviously that

206
00:08:57,300 --> 00:09:01,260
doesn't work it has two major downsides

207
00:09:01,260 --> 00:09:03,450
first of all you slow everything down

208
00:09:03,450 --> 00:09:06,540
you put security in the blocking mode

209
00:09:06,540 --> 00:09:09,959
you slow every single project down we

210
00:09:09,959 --> 00:09:13,140
yesterday in the panel mentioned the

211
00:09:13,140 --> 00:09:15,120
hundred to one ratio for 100 developers

212
00:09:15,120 --> 00:09:17,250
you have one security engineer you can't

213
00:09:17,250 --> 00:09:18,540
have your security engineer be the

214
00:09:18,540 --> 00:09:20,040
bottleneck that's impossible you're just

215
00:09:20,040 --> 00:09:23,600
gonna grind everything to a halt and

216
00:09:23,600 --> 00:09:26,160
secondly and probably the more dangerous

217
00:09:26,160 --> 00:09:27,480
of the two because you could always

218
00:09:27,480 --> 00:09:29,700
staff your security teams you have a

219
00:09:29,700 --> 00:09:31,290
hundred people and then you wouldn't

220
00:09:31,290 --> 00:09:34,050
have a bottleneck problem but when you

221
00:09:34,050 --> 00:09:38,970
remove the security dimensions from the

222
00:09:38,970 --> 00:09:41,040
work of developer and operator the

223
00:09:41,040 --> 00:09:42,870
absolves themselves from it in time they

224
00:09:42,870 --> 00:09:44,790
don't worry about it at all they can

225
00:09:44,790 --> 00:09:47,070
they will ship their features thinking

226
00:09:47,070 --> 00:09:49,080
I'm not even gonna check if I have a

227
00:09:49,080 --> 00:09:50,130
secret injection in there because

228
00:09:50,130 --> 00:09:51,600
there's a web application if I was gonna

229
00:09:51,600 --> 00:09:55,560
take care of this for me and a lot of

230
00:09:55,560 --> 00:09:58,050
organizations suffer from this they

231
00:09:58,050 --> 00:10:00,690
suffer from the developers not caring

232
00:10:00,690 --> 00:10:01,950
about security and they think it's

233
00:10:01,950 --> 00:10:03,300
because the developers are bad but

234
00:10:03,300 --> 00:10:04,680
perhaps it's because the security team

235
00:10:04,680 --> 00:10:06,570
is not telling them they need to care

236
00:10:06,570 --> 00:10:09,240
and helping them care about it so we

237
00:10:09,240 --> 00:10:13,279
know this is a bad situation to be in

238
00:10:14,690 --> 00:10:17,790
so one important aspect of changing this

239
00:10:17,790 --> 00:10:20,850
is getting closer to developers in

240
00:10:20,850 --> 00:10:25,190
operator and it took me a few years from

241
00:10:25,190 --> 00:10:30,150
the mid 2000 to 2012 2013 to get to that

242
00:10:30,150 --> 00:10:32,190
realization that I couldn't do my

243
00:10:32,190 --> 00:10:37,589
security work from afar and an

244
00:10:37,589 --> 00:10:40,200
interesting thing perhaps interesting

245
00:10:40,200 --> 00:10:41,730
saying about me is that I'm a nod

246
00:10:41,730 --> 00:10:44,190
security engineer what I actually like

247
00:10:44,190 --> 00:10:46,470
to do is to build things I like to build

248
00:10:46,470 --> 00:10:48,660
security services an active area network

249
00:10:48,660 --> 00:10:50,250
services internet services I like to put

250
00:10:50,250 --> 00:10:52,110
 on the internet and connect to it

251
00:10:52,110 --> 00:10:53,220
from the other side of the globe that's

252
00:10:53,220 --> 00:10:56,399
that's fun right security is really

253
00:10:56,399 --> 00:11:00,480
something I got into later on and at

254
00:11:00,480 --> 00:11:02,310
some point in my career I was running a

255
00:11:02,310 --> 00:11:03,690
website

256
00:11:03,690 --> 00:11:06,240
who is who wants to be a millionaire

257
00:11:06,240 --> 00:11:08,460
that was really one of the high point of

258
00:11:08,460 --> 00:11:11,130
my career it's just so proud of that one

259
00:11:11,130 --> 00:11:14,780
it's fantastic I remember telling my mom

260
00:11:14,780 --> 00:11:19,800
about it it was it was bad anyways so

261
00:11:19,800 --> 00:11:22,110
Who Wants to Be a Millionaire would air

262
00:11:22,110 --> 00:11:25,380
a question every day and they would

263
00:11:25,380 --> 00:11:29,010
point people to our website where they

264
00:11:29,010 --> 00:11:30,750
could answer the question gained a few

265
00:11:30,750 --> 00:11:32,430
points and spend those points buying

266
00:11:32,430 --> 00:11:35,130
 that they don't need and we would

267
00:11:35,130 --> 00:11:38,190
make money now this was a small

268
00:11:38,190 --> 00:11:41,910
operation and it was running of a single

269
00:11:41,910 --> 00:11:45,510
java web application hosted on a single

270
00:11:45,510 --> 00:11:47,430
server that I've graded like something

271
00:11:47,430 --> 00:11:50,160
with a couple of hosts behind the load

272
00:11:50,160 --> 00:11:51,810
balancer in a big database and every day

273
00:11:51,810 --> 00:11:52,950
that will air the question and we'll

274
00:11:52,950 --> 00:11:54,900
look at the graphs I will look at the

275
00:11:54,900 --> 00:11:58,140
requests coming a few hundred five

276
00:11:58,140 --> 00:12:01,010
hundred eight thousand two thousand and

277
00:12:01,010 --> 00:12:04,050
inevitably every single day the whole

278
00:12:04,050 --> 00:12:06,450
site would go down and fall down and

279
00:12:06,450 --> 00:12:10,100
crash completely but guess what

280
00:12:10,100 --> 00:12:13,710
didn't care by the time it crashed that

281
00:12:13,710 --> 00:12:15,720
already made a bucket load of money it

282
00:12:15,720 --> 00:12:17,370
was cheaper to keep running it this way

283
00:12:17,370 --> 00:12:18,930
than to spend a bunch of money and

284
00:12:18,930 --> 00:12:19,590
engineering

285
00:12:19,590 --> 00:12:21,360
I mean sure idea it would have been nice

286
00:12:21,360 --> 00:12:22,830
to have something that didn't crash

287
00:12:22,830 --> 00:12:29,640
every day but who cares crashed and the

288
00:12:29,640 --> 00:12:30,780
point I'm trying to make here is not

289
00:12:30,780 --> 00:12:34,430
that I'm a shitty system and right

290
00:12:34,550 --> 00:12:37,650
although that is depending on who you

291
00:12:37,650 --> 00:12:40,950
talk to you that may be true the point

292
00:12:40,950 --> 00:12:43,530
I'm trying to make is that serving the

293
00:12:43,530 --> 00:12:45,720
business was actually more important

294
00:12:45,720 --> 00:12:47,520
than doing perfect security or doing

295
00:12:47,520 --> 00:12:50,100
perfect infrastructure in this case this

296
00:12:50,100 --> 00:12:52,760
is an extreme example don't follow it

297
00:12:52,760 --> 00:12:56,930
but it was an interesting lesson about

298
00:12:56,930 --> 00:13:00,510
four years ago I decided to join a small

299
00:13:00,510 --> 00:13:03,780
group of engineers at Mozilla who is

300
00:13:03,780 --> 00:13:06,990
working on really redefining the way we

301
00:13:06,990 --> 00:13:09,170
build cloud services for Firefox and

302
00:13:09,170 --> 00:13:11,600
they were adapting all of the fancy

303
00:13:11,600 --> 00:13:13,560
shiny new things

304
00:13:13,560 --> 00:13:16,370
immutable deployments

305
00:13:16,370 --> 00:13:21,529
see ICD containerized applications etc

306
00:13:21,529 --> 00:13:23,630
etc you could add it the entire

307
00:13:23,630 --> 00:13:26,420
infrastructure without touching a single

308
00:13:26,420 --> 00:13:29,240
server we were playing with the idea of

309
00:13:29,240 --> 00:13:31,250
removing SSH completely from a

310
00:13:31,250 --> 00:13:33,529
production system etc so this was all

311
00:13:33,529 --> 00:13:35,480
super interesting to me but it was also

312
00:13:35,480 --> 00:13:37,610
scary because I came to this with my

313
00:13:37,610 --> 00:13:39,770
mental model of security from the

314
00:13:39,770 --> 00:13:41,600
infrastructure of mindset where you must

315
00:13:41,600 --> 00:13:43,580
have an IDs and controller of the

316
00:13:43,580 --> 00:13:46,610
outbound connection etc and and EWS was

317
00:13:46,610 --> 00:13:48,680
the enemy and DevOps was just this thing

318
00:13:48,680 --> 00:13:50,180
everybody was laughing at in the

319
00:13:50,180 --> 00:13:53,150
security so this was really like the

320
00:13:53,150 --> 00:13:55,880
like this is a trend of deaf psyche ups

321
00:13:55,880 --> 00:13:57,380
the Deaf Cyclops keyword on Google right

322
00:13:57,380 --> 00:13:59,240
in 2015 where like people are like

323
00:13:59,240 --> 00:14:01,220
slowly you know starting to talk about

324
00:14:01,220 --> 00:14:02,660
it but no one's really taking it

325
00:14:02,660 --> 00:14:06,200
seriously and so what was interesting to

326
00:14:06,200 --> 00:14:07,910
me is that I'm not I'm not an early

327
00:14:07,910 --> 00:14:11,420
adopter right my notion of learning new

328
00:14:11,420 --> 00:14:14,150
things is this this is picking up

329
00:14:14,150 --> 00:14:16,370
woodworking and learning joinery right

330
00:14:16,370 --> 00:14:18,620
and by the way those two stories on the

331
00:14:18,620 --> 00:14:21,470
beams here with all metal things as I

332
00:14:21,470 --> 00:14:23,390
don't know don't trust that thing but

333
00:14:23,390 --> 00:14:27,410
anyways the point is this was kind of a

334
00:14:27,410 --> 00:14:29,720
leap of faith you me let's go see what

335
00:14:29,720 --> 00:14:31,160
this team is doing how they're operating

336
00:14:31,160 --> 00:14:34,310
differently and another interesting

337
00:14:34,310 --> 00:14:37,040
thing is that this group had no security

338
00:14:37,040 --> 00:14:39,170
team the reason I was going is because

339
00:14:39,170 --> 00:14:42,200
the manager of that team knew you needed

340
00:14:42,200 --> 00:14:46,790
security didn't want to rely on external

341
00:14:46,790 --> 00:14:49,250
security teams that weren't fully aware

342
00:14:49,250 --> 00:14:50,540
of what they were trying to do and

343
00:14:50,540 --> 00:14:52,730
wanted someone in-house the query inside

344
00:14:52,730 --> 00:14:55,160
the team so this is kind of how I felt

345
00:14:55,160 --> 00:14:58,730
joining the team I am the security

346
00:14:58,730 --> 00:15:01,459
engineer and I'm walking into the Lions

347
00:15:01,459 --> 00:15:04,070
Den surrounded by Sisson means who spend

348
00:15:04,070 --> 00:15:07,660
the entire career distrusting security

349
00:15:07,660 --> 00:15:12,770
and you may feel this way in a few

350
00:15:12,770 --> 00:15:14,630
situations in your own organizations

351
00:15:14,630 --> 00:15:17,800
where you don't really feel invited

352
00:15:17,800 --> 00:15:20,060
you're sitting in those meetings and

353
00:15:20,060 --> 00:15:22,490
like well I guess I didn't really expect

354
00:15:22,490 --> 00:15:24,080
me sometimes they tell you oh you're

355
00:15:24,080 --> 00:15:26,500
here

356
00:15:27,360 --> 00:15:31,899
and and so security people usually see

357
00:15:31,899 --> 00:15:34,839
the system ins as the enemy they're the

358
00:15:34,839 --> 00:15:36,130
ones who don't update the servers

359
00:15:36,130 --> 00:15:37,480
they're the ones who don't care about

360
00:15:37,480 --> 00:15:39,220
using weak passwords

361
00:15:39,220 --> 00:15:41,470
they're the ones who leave the networks

362
00:15:41,470 --> 00:15:43,089
wide open to the Internet

363
00:15:43,089 --> 00:15:44,740
they're the ones who don't do what we

364
00:15:44,740 --> 00:15:46,480
tell them to do they fail and

365
00:15:46,480 --> 00:15:47,830
implementing all these security things

366
00:15:47,830 --> 00:15:49,630
we tell them to care about there's the

367
00:15:49,630 --> 00:15:52,180
enemy and to be fair this here's the

368
00:15:52,180 --> 00:15:55,060
same way where when I saw Ron in the

369
00:15:55,060 --> 00:15:57,880
tower like in the big eye is seeing

370
00:15:57,880 --> 00:16:00,399
everything looking at every aspect of

371
00:16:00,399 --> 00:16:02,110
their work then going to their managers

372
00:16:02,110 --> 00:16:04,300
telling them they up and then

373
00:16:04,300 --> 00:16:05,980
telling them they need to fix it now and

374
00:16:05,980 --> 00:16:08,320
then goes down they hate us right so we

375
00:16:08,320 --> 00:16:11,279
have this conflictual relationship

376
00:16:11,279 --> 00:16:14,740
between the statement here and there I

377
00:16:14,740 --> 00:16:17,830
am a security guy joining an Operations

378
00:16:17,830 --> 00:16:20,890
team you know not joining like literally

379
00:16:20,890 --> 00:16:22,510
in the operations team reporting to the

380
00:16:22,510 --> 00:16:25,450
same people so this was an interesting

381
00:16:25,450 --> 00:16:27,820
situation for me to be in and I realized

382
00:16:27,820 --> 00:16:30,940
I couldn't come to this with my usual

383
00:16:30,940 --> 00:16:32,890
approach to security which is just barge

384
00:16:32,890 --> 00:16:35,560
in with a bunch of controls and and and

385
00:16:35,560 --> 00:16:37,329
spread them across all the projects that

386
00:16:37,329 --> 00:16:40,029
you have to do all of this and then move

387
00:16:40,029 --> 00:16:41,860
back and go back to do my own thing I

388
00:16:41,860 --> 00:16:45,100
had to win them over right so I needed

389
00:16:45,100 --> 00:16:47,890
something to show them that they could

390
00:16:47,890 --> 00:16:49,230
trust me

391
00:16:49,230 --> 00:16:53,620
thankfully one of the senior member of

392
00:16:53,620 --> 00:16:57,940
that team messed up shortly before I

393
00:16:57,940 --> 00:17:00,100
joined the team actually and pushed

394
00:17:00,100 --> 00:17:05,650
that's not him I was like a skateboard

395
00:17:05,650 --> 00:17:10,059
actually great great engineer fantastic

396
00:17:10,059 --> 00:17:12,790
engineer someone who is tons and tons of

397
00:17:12,790 --> 00:17:14,380
experience and I know working with him

398
00:17:14,380 --> 00:17:20,109
still today and he pushed a version of

399
00:17:20,109 --> 00:17:22,059
the secrets repository that wasn't

400
00:17:22,059 --> 00:17:25,240
encrypted at the time up to another

401
00:17:25,240 --> 00:17:27,250
github repo where it wasn't supposed to

402
00:17:27,250 --> 00:17:28,660
be at all effectively leaking the

403
00:17:28,660 --> 00:17:31,100
secrets of the infrastructure out

404
00:17:31,100 --> 00:17:33,770
and and it did this with you know with

405
00:17:33,770 --> 00:17:36,320
the the confidence of someone who has

406
00:17:36,320 --> 00:17:38,840
run these commands hundreds and hundreds

407
00:17:38,840 --> 00:17:41,120
of times over the years right so

408
00:17:41,120 --> 00:17:42,800
thankfully that that didn't end up being

409
00:17:42,800 --> 00:17:44,120
too bad because the github repo was

410
00:17:44,120 --> 00:17:46,370
private but still it was a pretty strong

411
00:17:46,370 --> 00:17:48,740
wake-up call that secret management

412
00:17:48,740 --> 00:17:52,010
wasn't up to par so we had to fix it

413
00:17:52,010 --> 00:17:55,850
right and this was a perfect project for

414
00:17:55,850 --> 00:17:56,180
me

415
00:17:56,180 --> 00:17:57,680
because I happen to know a few things

416
00:17:57,680 --> 00:18:02,570
about security and so we decided to put

417
00:18:02,570 --> 00:18:04,280
that on the table and start looking at

418
00:18:04,280 --> 00:18:05,900
how we could improve secrets management

419
00:18:05,900 --> 00:18:08,420
in the organization and now my typical

420
00:18:08,420 --> 00:18:11,140
approach to doing this at the time was I

421
00:18:11,140 --> 00:18:14,240
build a tool a fantastic new tool that's

422
00:18:14,240 --> 00:18:17,360
gonna be beautiful and great and then

423
00:18:17,360 --> 00:18:20,060
shove that into the operation team and

424
00:18:20,060 --> 00:18:22,010
spend weeks convincing everybody until

425
00:18:22,010 --> 00:18:24,980
they either convince or cave or their

426
00:18:24,980 --> 00:18:28,010
boss tells them to get along with it but

427
00:18:28,010 --> 00:18:32,360
not here I couldn't do that here mostly

428
00:18:32,360 --> 00:18:34,700
because most of our approaches at the

429
00:18:34,700 --> 00:18:37,970
time didn't work where at the time you

430
00:18:37,970 --> 00:18:40,250
would encrypt a file with GPG and you

431
00:18:40,250 --> 00:18:41,900
will decrypt it with GPG which by the

432
00:18:41,900 --> 00:18:44,830
way storyboard launches GPG please

433
00:18:44,830 --> 00:18:48,950
that's another talk the end but the

434
00:18:48,950 --> 00:18:50,120
problem with that is that you need to

435
00:18:50,120 --> 00:18:51,890
put your gvg decryption key on the

436
00:18:51,890 --> 00:18:53,300
server and we're talking about everybody

437
00:18:53,300 --> 00:18:54,830
s instances that I know Toto skating

438
00:18:54,830 --> 00:18:57,170
mode obviously that doesn't work right

439
00:18:57,170 --> 00:18:59,090
so you have the bootstrapping of trust

440
00:18:59,090 --> 00:19:01,550
problem which nowadays is one understood

441
00:19:01,550 --> 00:19:03,350
in fix we have talks about secret

442
00:19:03,350 --> 00:19:05,630
management this afternoon you can look

443
00:19:05,630 --> 00:19:07,940
at a dozen or so projects that do this

444
00:19:07,940 --> 00:19:10,190
properly but we had to figure out how to

445
00:19:10,190 --> 00:19:13,700
integrate that into our new provisioning

446
00:19:13,700 --> 00:19:16,340
and deployment models so instead of

447
00:19:16,340 --> 00:19:18,710
building a tool and and just shoving it

448
00:19:18,710 --> 00:19:20,870
onto the team we study iterating on the

449
00:19:20,870 --> 00:19:21,620
model together

450
00:19:21,620 --> 00:19:23,900
and we came up with a first you know to

451
00:19:23,900 --> 00:19:26,600
like black box can we use this and then

452
00:19:26,600 --> 00:19:28,850
started iterating on it all right well

453
00:19:28,850 --> 00:19:30,230
maybe we need something you have

454
00:19:30,230 --> 00:19:32,150
encrypted security nets three the ec2

455
00:19:32,150 --> 00:19:34,160
instance retrieves time etc the ops team

456
00:19:34,160 --> 00:19:35,570
came along and said well we need

457
00:19:35,570 --> 00:19:37,430
versioning so we need to be able to

458
00:19:37,430 --> 00:19:39,670
deploy stacks by version more than

459
00:19:39,670 --> 00:19:41,790
back by version because that's how we do

460
00:19:41,790 --> 00:19:44,440
continuous deployment etc and we keep

461
00:19:44,440 --> 00:19:46,990
working on this together until we got to

462
00:19:46,990 --> 00:19:50,140
a model that made sense to us where we

463
00:19:50,140 --> 00:19:52,540
really could see that fit into the

464
00:19:52,540 --> 00:19:54,640
deployment pipeline nicely now what's

465
00:19:54,640 --> 00:19:57,640
interesting here is that by the time we

466
00:19:57,640 --> 00:20:01,930
reached the force proposal I didn't have

467
00:20:01,930 --> 00:20:03,790
to sell this the operations team on it

468
00:20:03,790 --> 00:20:04,300
anymore

469
00:20:04,300 --> 00:20:06,430
they had shaped the design they had

470
00:20:06,430 --> 00:20:08,740
shaped the goals they actually wanted

471
00:20:08,740 --> 00:20:11,230
the thing mr. trick is that I hadn't

472
00:20:11,230 --> 00:20:12,760
written a single line of code by that

473
00:20:12,760 --> 00:20:14,380
point so it was a chance I wouldn't be

474
00:20:14,380 --> 00:20:17,680
able to do this but that was a risk

475
00:20:17,680 --> 00:20:19,240
worth taking the way I thought it was

476
00:20:19,240 --> 00:20:20,560
very interesting experience that we

477
00:20:20,560 --> 00:20:22,900
worked together on building a security

478
00:20:22,900 --> 00:20:25,000
tool and to them it was new because they

479
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:27,220
had never worked on building a security

480
00:20:27,220 --> 00:20:28,810
tool usually security came with their

481
00:20:28,810 --> 00:20:31,810
torch telling them to use it so this

482
00:20:31,810 --> 00:20:34,540
project was successful it turned into an

483
00:20:34,540 --> 00:20:37,960
open source project called sobs which we

484
00:20:37,960 --> 00:20:40,000
still use today since I started this

485
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:44,010
talk we probably already deployed a

486
00:20:44,010 --> 00:20:46,480
couple dozen in situ instances that use

487
00:20:46,480 --> 00:20:50,410
sobs - to decrypt their secrets

488
00:20:50,410 --> 00:20:52,450
and I think it's I mean it's it's used

489
00:20:52,450 --> 00:20:53,800
quite a bit around the community people

490
00:20:53,800 --> 00:20:55,780
like it it's one of the many secrets

491
00:20:55,780 --> 00:20:59,140
management tools but more importantly we

492
00:20:59,140 --> 00:21:01,630
learned that we shouldn't just build

493
00:21:01,630 --> 00:21:04,300
security tools we should build

494
00:21:04,300 --> 00:21:06,520
operational tools that do things

495
00:21:06,520 --> 00:21:08,920
securely right solve the operational

496
00:21:08,920 --> 00:21:11,590
need first an integrated security into

497
00:21:11,590 --> 00:21:12,850
that and that was an interesting shift

498
00:21:12,850 --> 00:21:15,490
in mental model for me that I actually

499
00:21:15,490 --> 00:21:17,440
continued to apply it throughout you

500
00:21:17,440 --> 00:21:20,980
know building this devstack ops team so

501
00:21:20,980 --> 00:21:23,200
I was embedded I was embedded in that

502
00:21:23,200 --> 00:21:26,140
Operations team for a couple of years

503
00:21:26,140 --> 00:21:29,110
actually until fairly recently when when

504
00:21:29,110 --> 00:21:31,660
my security group like grow beyond the

505
00:21:31,660 --> 00:21:34,440
size where and being embedded made sense

506
00:21:34,440 --> 00:21:37,480
and and what was interesting throughout

507
00:21:37,480 --> 00:21:40,750
these years is that I was not just a

508
00:21:40,750 --> 00:21:42,820
security expert I was their security

509
00:21:42,820 --> 00:21:45,370
expert they trusted me we did security

510
00:21:45,370 --> 00:21:47,650
incidents together we worked on

511
00:21:47,650 --> 00:21:49,570
everything together they will come to me

512
00:21:49,570 --> 00:21:50,950
for help I will come to them

513
00:21:50,950 --> 00:21:52,869
to find good solutions to our problems

514
00:21:52,869 --> 00:21:55,179
and and I wasn't the external security

515
00:21:55,179 --> 00:21:58,090
guy I was their security guy right and

516
00:21:58,090 --> 00:22:00,159
that is a very very powerful thing when

517
00:22:00,159 --> 00:22:02,230
you're doing security something that we

518
00:22:02,230 --> 00:22:04,450
don't capitalize on very much so what I

519
00:22:04,450 --> 00:22:06,159
started thinking about this in terms of

520
00:22:06,159 --> 00:22:10,480
how we build security teams and and you

521
00:22:10,480 --> 00:22:11,980
really have two models in most

522
00:22:11,980 --> 00:22:14,139
organization the most common one is a

523
00:22:14,139 --> 00:22:17,259
centralized model it's a model where you

524
00:22:17,259 --> 00:22:19,359
have a chief security officer that we

525
00:22:19,359 --> 00:22:21,759
post to the CEO and the chief security

526
00:22:21,759 --> 00:22:25,149
officer has a security team all right

527
00:22:25,149 --> 00:22:29,830
and the see the security organization is

528
00:22:29,830 --> 00:22:31,960
separate from the engineering groups the

529
00:22:31,960 --> 00:22:33,549
distributed model is basically the

530
00:22:33,549 --> 00:22:35,320
opposite you may have achieved security

531
00:22:35,320 --> 00:22:37,090
officers that's up there doing strategy

532
00:22:37,090 --> 00:22:38,950
but the security teams are kind of

533
00:22:38,950 --> 00:22:41,259
embedded and belong to the engineering

534
00:22:41,259 --> 00:22:45,279
groups now both models have their pros

535
00:22:45,279 --> 00:22:48,369
and cons that this decentralized one has

536
00:22:48,369 --> 00:22:51,999
a benefit of having a strong opinionated

537
00:22:51,999 --> 00:22:55,539
secure cohesive security team that can

538
00:22:55,539 --> 00:22:58,929
influence the organization but the

539
00:22:58,929 --> 00:23:00,519
downside is that they are far away from

540
00:23:00,519 --> 00:23:02,200
the engineering team so they have

541
00:23:02,200 --> 00:23:04,690
usually incomplete information and have

542
00:23:04,690 --> 00:23:07,330
to make a lot of assumptions the

543
00:23:07,330 --> 00:23:09,639
distributed model is the opposite they

544
00:23:09,639 --> 00:23:11,350
have good information they're embedded

545
00:23:11,350 --> 00:23:12,759
in the engineering team so they know

546
00:23:12,759 --> 00:23:14,769
what's going on they can fix it where it

547
00:23:14,769 --> 00:23:18,600
happens but they don't have this large

548
00:23:18,600 --> 00:23:21,669
security organization that can probably

549
00:23:21,669 --> 00:23:23,230
use its weight to shape the

550
00:23:23,230 --> 00:23:26,100
organizational change systemic problems

551
00:23:26,100 --> 00:23:29,440
there's a hybrid model that I really

552
00:23:29,440 --> 00:23:30,580
like that I really believe in

553
00:23:30,580 --> 00:23:33,009
it's the embedded model in the embedded

554
00:23:33,009 --> 00:23:35,499
model is one that you see in a lot of

555
00:23:35,499 --> 00:23:37,480
more modern more DevOps organization

556
00:23:37,480 --> 00:23:39,100
where you do have that security

557
00:23:39,100 --> 00:23:40,929
organization reports to sites or reports

558
00:23:40,929 --> 00:23:44,109
to the CEO but the engine security

559
00:23:44,109 --> 00:23:47,350
engineers are embedded into the

560
00:23:47,350 --> 00:23:49,330
engineering groups now what embedded

561
00:23:49,330 --> 00:23:51,129
means here is very very important we're

562
00:23:51,129 --> 00:23:52,929
not just talking about some security guy

563
00:23:52,929 --> 00:23:55,779
who go attends meeting and and you know

564
00:23:55,779 --> 00:23:56,980
every once in a while has an opinion

565
00:23:56,980 --> 00:23:58,600
about something we're talking about

566
00:23:58,600 --> 00:24:01,239
security engineer who helped belong to

567
00:24:01,239 --> 00:24:01,760
those engine

568
00:24:01,760 --> 00:24:03,620
team says and if the engineering manager

569
00:24:03,620 --> 00:24:06,830
of Group A or Group B needs security

570
00:24:06,830 --> 00:24:10,250
work done they ask their own security

571
00:24:10,250 --> 00:24:11,900
embedded security engineer and they can

572
00:24:11,900 --> 00:24:14,420
influence their priorities they have

573
00:24:14,420 --> 00:24:18,230
control over what they work on it's

574
00:24:18,230 --> 00:24:20,540
basically a consultant right they

575
00:24:20,540 --> 00:24:23,810
control their work so one of the main

576
00:24:23,810 --> 00:24:24,890
problem you'll see in another

577
00:24:24,890 --> 00:24:26,750
organization is that the you have

578
00:24:26,750 --> 00:24:28,760
embedded engineers but every time the

579
00:24:28,760 --> 00:24:30,110
engineering managers will ask can you do

580
00:24:30,110 --> 00:24:32,450
X for me the engineers would say what

581
00:24:32,450 --> 00:24:33,920
I'm sorry that's not my priorities for

582
00:24:33,920 --> 00:24:36,290
this quarter right so what's the point

583
00:24:36,290 --> 00:24:39,170
of being embedded if you can't help so

584
00:24:39,170 --> 00:24:40,850
here what's really important is this

585
00:24:40,850 --> 00:24:43,880
aspect that when you plan the resources

586
00:24:43,880 --> 00:24:45,650
of your security organization make sure

587
00:24:45,650 --> 00:24:47,810
your locate 30 or 50 percent of time

588
00:24:47,810 --> 00:24:49,100
that's under the control of the team

589
00:24:49,100 --> 00:24:51,230
they're embedded in and those problems

590
00:24:51,230 --> 00:24:52,520
will come because they won't be able to

591
00:24:52,520 --> 00:24:54,800
you won't be about you account for that

592
00:24:54,800 --> 00:24:56,600
time in advance you'll have to do it on

593
00:24:56,600 --> 00:24:59,660
the fly another aspect that is very very

594
00:24:59,660 --> 00:25:00,830
important we talked about this a little

595
00:25:00,830 --> 00:25:02,780
bit yesterday is security champion which

596
00:25:02,780 --> 00:25:04,820
is basically reverse embedding you take

597
00:25:04,820 --> 00:25:06,680
engineers from the organization you

598
00:25:06,680 --> 00:25:08,240
bring them into your security

599
00:25:08,240 --> 00:25:10,940
organization now the way you do that is

600
00:25:10,940 --> 00:25:13,730
very important you can't just snap a

601
00:25:13,730 --> 00:25:16,550
security champion sticker on a bunch of

602
00:25:16,550 --> 00:25:19,100
developers and say right now your job is

603
00:25:19,100 --> 00:25:20,780
to make sure security is done properly

604
00:25:20,780 --> 00:25:21,800
everywhere because that's that's

605
00:25:21,800 --> 00:25:23,930
 you need to invest in them you

606
00:25:23,930 --> 00:25:26,120
need to help them grow the first thing

607
00:25:26,120 --> 00:25:28,760
you need to do is to make your security

608
00:25:28,760 --> 00:25:31,910
organization transparent to allow them

609
00:25:31,910 --> 00:25:33,620
to attend meetings where the decisions

610
00:25:33,620 --> 00:25:35,300
are taken to allow them to shape the

611
00:25:35,300 --> 00:25:37,580
security strategy there's no reason

612
00:25:37,580 --> 00:25:40,010
there should be a closed meeting where

613
00:25:40,010 --> 00:25:41,450
they can't attend unless it's a

614
00:25:41,450 --> 00:25:43,610
particularly sensitive security incident

615
00:25:43,610 --> 00:25:45,170
okay fine

616
00:25:45,170 --> 00:25:46,760
but if it's just your regular team

617
00:25:46,760 --> 00:25:48,710
meeting or your regular project meeting

618
00:25:48,710 --> 00:25:50,900
let the security champions join in let

619
00:25:50,900 --> 00:25:54,020
them chip in let them learn shape the

620
00:25:54,020 --> 00:25:59,379
decisions etc run an open organization

621
00:26:00,150 --> 00:26:03,480
now what you really want to get out of

622
00:26:03,480 --> 00:26:06,660
these models is to avoid making

623
00:26:06,660 --> 00:26:09,230
assumptions to get enough information

624
00:26:09,230 --> 00:26:12,450
that every single decision you make is

625
00:26:12,450 --> 00:26:15,560
based on really good hard data and not

626
00:26:15,560 --> 00:26:22,080
assumptions when I first joined Mozilla

627
00:26:22,080 --> 00:26:24,360
I was working on this project in the

628
00:26:24,360 --> 00:26:25,970
panel yesterday they honest like you

629
00:26:25,970 --> 00:26:28,250
have any regrets

630
00:26:28,250 --> 00:26:31,800
this is mine I spent two years working

631
00:26:31,800 --> 00:26:34,650
on endpoint security super cool project

632
00:26:34,650 --> 00:26:36,450
complete Greenfield implemented in go

633
00:26:36,450 --> 00:26:39,120
new language fancy stuff you could run a

634
00:26:39,120 --> 00:26:40,800
command and it would go inspect

635
00:26:40,800 --> 00:26:43,020
thousands of servers within seconds and

636
00:26:43,020 --> 00:26:45,630
and return to you that a string isn't a

637
00:26:45,630 --> 00:26:47,100
fine on that server on the other side of

638
00:26:47,100 --> 00:26:50,130
the infrastructure it was super cool and

639
00:26:50,130 --> 00:26:52,530
not very useful and the reason for that

640
00:26:52,530 --> 00:26:54,630
is that we had super fancy modules I

641
00:26:54,630 --> 00:26:56,070
think the one that's on the demo here is

642
00:26:56,070 --> 00:26:58,200
a is a file module a it looks for

643
00:26:58,200 --> 00:27:01,500
private key in /home across all the

644
00:27:01,500 --> 00:27:04,020
server's what it's a subset of service

645
00:27:04,020 --> 00:27:06,030
and and it will return the servers that

646
00:27:06,030 --> 00:27:08,520
have a private key in /home right that

647
00:27:08,520 --> 00:27:10,200
was a way for us to find servers that

648
00:27:10,200 --> 00:27:14,310
had bad things and all of those fancy

649
00:27:14,310 --> 00:27:16,590
modules look it's four strings in memory

650
00:27:16,590 --> 00:27:20,730
two etc etc we never use them the way we

651
00:27:20,730 --> 00:27:24,090
used meg was as an inventory tool we

652
00:27:24,090 --> 00:27:25,860
used me to list the servers we had

653
00:27:25,860 --> 00:27:28,230
running that possibly were accessible

654
00:27:28,230 --> 00:27:29,640
from the internet or running on a given

655
00:27:29,640 --> 00:27:31,980
version of an operating system had a

656
00:27:31,980 --> 00:27:34,890
given package we needed an inventory and

657
00:27:34,890 --> 00:27:37,170
Meg was the right tool to give us a data

658
00:27:37,170 --> 00:27:39,000
because we didn't have any other but

659
00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:41,730
this was pre cloud this was before you

660
00:27:41,730 --> 00:27:44,310
could query your entire everything from

661
00:27:44,310 --> 00:27:48,750
an API really what we were trying to do

662
00:27:48,750 --> 00:27:51,630
here we're trying to

663
00:27:51,630 --> 00:27:53,610
and by the way is what's called mozilla

664
00:27:53,610 --> 00:27:55,830
investigator and the logo was a gator

665
00:27:55,830 --> 00:27:58,790
get it

666
00:28:01,850 --> 00:28:04,050
what we're trying to do was removing

667
00:28:04,050 --> 00:28:08,610
assumptions it's not something that's

668
00:28:08,610 --> 00:28:10,650
specific to security industry the New

669
00:28:10,650 --> 00:28:12,780
York Times wrote a fantastic article on

670
00:28:12,780 --> 00:28:17,310
what failed on the 737 max and at the

671
00:28:17,310 --> 00:28:20,640
core of it and they said and I quote

672
00:28:20,640 --> 00:28:23,970
after Boeing removed one of the sensor

673
00:28:23,970 --> 00:28:27,480
from an automated flight system the Jets

674
00:28:27,480 --> 00:28:29,670
designers and regulators still proceeded

675
00:28:29,670 --> 00:28:32,940
as if they would be - they made the

676
00:28:32,940 --> 00:28:34,550
assumption that would be two sensors

677
00:28:34,550 --> 00:28:37,520
they had bad information

678
00:28:37,520 --> 00:28:39,600
every organization fair in a way

679
00:28:39,600 --> 00:28:41,940
hopefully not with the kind of dramatic

680
00:28:41,940 --> 00:28:45,870
consequences that happened to Boeing but

681
00:28:45,870 --> 00:28:50,190
personally I up - this is a post

682
00:28:50,190 --> 00:28:51,990
mortem report you may if you use Firefox

683
00:28:51,990 --> 00:28:53,970
you may have noticed about four months

684
00:28:53,970 --> 00:28:54,330
ago

685
00:28:54,330 --> 00:28:56,940
we had a little bit of a blip and you

686
00:28:56,940 --> 00:28:59,130
couldn't load add-ons for like a couple

687
00:28:59,130 --> 00:29:02,880
days right in the post mortem our CTO

688
00:29:02,880 --> 00:29:05,580
wrote the team responsible for the

689
00:29:05,580 --> 00:29:07,500
system which generated the signatures

690
00:29:07,500 --> 00:29:09,150
knew that the certificate was expiring

691
00:29:09,150 --> 00:29:12,600
but thought incorrectly that Firefox

692
00:29:12,600 --> 00:29:16,080
ignored the expiration dates the team

693
00:29:16,080 --> 00:29:20,340
responsible hi

694
00:29:20,340 --> 00:29:23,940
I made an assumption two years ago when

695
00:29:23,940 --> 00:29:25,230
I should have certificate that Firefox

696
00:29:25,230 --> 00:29:27,360
would ignore the signatures I didn't

697
00:29:27,360 --> 00:29:29,820
test that assumption this is what

698
00:29:29,820 --> 00:29:32,460
happened we brew up a product for a few

699
00:29:32,460 --> 00:29:34,320
hundred million users test your

700
00:29:34,320 --> 00:29:35,790
assumptions if there is one thing you

701
00:29:35,790 --> 00:29:38,340
should get out of this talk is that you

702
00:29:38,340 --> 00:29:42,050
should test your assumptions always now

703
00:29:42,050 --> 00:29:45,510
when Firefox blew up I was on parent

704
00:29:45,510 --> 00:29:47,790
leave traveling the country I got a

705
00:29:47,790 --> 00:29:50,220
phone call I was in Page Arizona at

706
00:29:50,220 --> 00:29:53,000
birdie at Internet as sat at this table

707
00:29:53,000 --> 00:29:56,070
by the campsite where I could get some

708
00:29:56,070 --> 00:30:00,680
internet from like 9 p.m. to 5 a.m. now

709
00:30:00,680 --> 00:30:03,060
it was warm during the day but in Page

710
00:30:03,060 --> 00:30:05,400
Arizona it's Mike's 35 degrees at night

711
00:30:05,400 --> 00:30:06,870
i wouldíve I wasn't wearing shoes I got

712
00:30:06,870 --> 00:30:09,390
sick for three days anyways like this is

713
00:30:09,390 --> 00:30:10,680
what happens when you make assumptions

714
00:30:10,680 --> 00:30:12,990
you end up in a bad situation trying to

715
00:30:12,990 --> 00:30:14,460
fix the security incident with hundreds

716
00:30:14,460 --> 00:30:16,260
of people and poor internet don't make

717
00:30:16,260 --> 00:30:20,190
assumptions assumptions lead to

718
00:30:20,190 --> 00:30:22,470
vulnerability remember this it is

719
00:30:22,470 --> 00:30:25,260
extremely important now thankfully there

720
00:30:25,260 --> 00:30:29,400
is a cure data you need to have data in

721
00:30:29,400 --> 00:30:31,110
each you have very very good data you

722
00:30:31,110 --> 00:30:32,970
need to expose that data give that data

723
00:30:32,970 --> 00:30:34,650
to everybody in your organization let

724
00:30:34,650 --> 00:30:36,570
them look at it let them review it

725
00:30:36,570 --> 00:30:39,240
let them debate it maybe disagree with

726
00:30:39,240 --> 00:30:42,600
it data brings you confidence now the

727
00:30:42,600 --> 00:30:45,600
data is only as good as the tool that

728
00:30:45,600 --> 00:30:48,170
gives you the data so you need to trust

729
00:30:48,170 --> 00:30:50,820
your tests you need to have really

730
00:30:50,820 --> 00:30:52,860
really good tests and here I have an

731
00:30:52,860 --> 00:30:55,140
example from one of our testing

732
00:30:55,140 --> 00:30:57,450
framework that could Frost you can see

733
00:30:57,450 --> 00:31:00,240
that github coms Mozilla Frost and it's

734
00:31:00,240 --> 00:31:03,090
kind of like a it's based on PI tests

735
00:31:03,090 --> 00:31:05,820
and we run a bunch of tests for AWS GCP

736
00:31:05,820 --> 00:31:08,610
Heroku etc etc and in this test I think

737
00:31:08,610 --> 00:31:13,590
it's interesting because it is a test

738
00:31:13,590 --> 00:31:15,240
that verifies that our see two instances

739
00:31:15,240 --> 00:31:18,420
run on a mis that are up-to-date and now

740
00:31:18,420 --> 00:31:20,400
the definition of that tests initially

741
00:31:20,400 --> 00:31:23,280
as we came up with it was wrong it was

742
00:31:23,280 --> 00:31:27,030
flagging everything as insecure and we

743
00:31:27,030 --> 00:31:29,430
iterated on it with the operations team

744
00:31:29,430 --> 00:31:32,380
to understand exactly what

745
00:31:32,380 --> 00:31:34,150
the test should be what the compliance

746
00:31:34,150 --> 00:31:37,179
level should be what does it mean to run

747
00:31:37,179 --> 00:31:39,400
on an ami we consider secure one of the

748
00:31:39,400 --> 00:31:42,190
thing we change is that we only run we

749
00:31:42,190 --> 00:31:44,470
only accept a.m. eyes that are owned by

750
00:31:44,470 --> 00:31:46,210
us that hosted in one of our account

751
00:31:46,210 --> 00:31:48,880
another thing is that we decided the DMI

752
00:31:48,880 --> 00:31:51,880
had to be no older than a configured

753
00:31:51,880 --> 00:31:53,950
date right and these two things together

754
00:31:53,950 --> 00:31:57,880
were actually discussed debated with the

755
00:31:57,880 --> 00:31:59,860
operation team until we reach the point

756
00:31:59,860 --> 00:32:01,299
where we thought yeah this this makes a

757
00:32:01,299 --> 00:32:02,950
lot of sense let's put that in the test

758
00:32:02,950 --> 00:32:05,590
run it and get some data out of it again

759
00:32:05,590 --> 00:32:08,830
we didn't just shove that test and the

760
00:32:08,830 --> 00:32:10,030
metrics that go with it onto the

761
00:32:10,030 --> 00:32:16,650
operations team we built it together so

762
00:32:16,650 --> 00:32:19,240
that feed into a very important point

763
00:32:19,240 --> 00:32:20,950
when you do security in your

764
00:32:20,950 --> 00:32:23,049
organization you need to make it very

765
00:32:23,049 --> 00:32:24,760
very clear with everyone involved what

766
00:32:24,760 --> 00:32:26,770
you believe the expectations are from a

767
00:32:26,770 --> 00:32:27,909
security perspective

768
00:32:27,909 --> 00:32:30,039
no surprises nobody likes surprises

769
00:32:30,039 --> 00:32:32,020
nobody likes that graph when they try to

770
00:32:32,020 --> 00:32:33,970
ship something to production and only

771
00:32:33,970 --> 00:32:35,559
realize that in fact they're missing a

772
00:32:35,559 --> 00:32:36,909
bunch of security stuff that the

773
00:32:36,909 --> 00:32:38,350
security team really really wants and

774
00:32:38,350 --> 00:32:40,720
nobody told them about that's terrible

775
00:32:40,720 --> 00:32:42,600
so you need to set clear expectations

776
00:32:42,600 --> 00:32:46,240
now we tried a few things over the years

777
00:32:46,240 --> 00:32:49,450
this is Simon Bennett's he wrote a blog

778
00:32:49,450 --> 00:32:50,980
post about this that was like two and a

779
00:32:50,980 --> 00:32:54,400
half years ago and and Simon works on Oh

780
00:32:54,400 --> 00:32:56,289
ASP zap you may know him for his work on

781
00:32:56,289 --> 00:32:58,600
this and in the team is the one who came

782
00:32:58,600 --> 00:33:01,270
up with the the model of what we call

783
00:33:01,270 --> 00:33:03,059
the security the web security baseline

784
00:33:03,059 --> 00:33:05,470
the web security baseline is a basic set

785
00:33:05,470 --> 00:33:07,630
of controllers that we want everybody to

786
00:33:07,630 --> 00:33:11,559
implement now we saw initially that we

787
00:33:11,559 --> 00:33:14,409
could get zapped integrated into our

788
00:33:14,409 --> 00:33:15,820
Jenkins pipeline and every time

789
00:33:15,820 --> 00:33:17,530
something would go to pre-production and

790
00:33:17,530 --> 00:33:19,330
then to production we would test the

791
00:33:19,330 --> 00:33:20,890
baseline and if it didn't pass the

792
00:33:20,890 --> 00:33:23,830
baseline it would it would actually fail

793
00:33:23,830 --> 00:33:25,929
and prevent production deploys and we

794
00:33:25,929 --> 00:33:27,640
built a bunch of tooling like this is a

795
00:33:27,640 --> 00:33:30,580
run of for the SAP container with the

796
00:33:30,580 --> 00:33:33,220
baseline and the upper part is a circle

797
00:33:33,220 --> 00:33:36,700
CI snippet and the lower part is is like

798
00:33:36,700 --> 00:33:38,710
the what what the tool will output and

799
00:33:38,710 --> 00:33:40,360
if you have everything good you don't

800
00:33:40,360 --> 00:33:42,429
have any failure it exists with a zero

801
00:33:42,429 --> 00:33:44,300
so it passes and if

802
00:33:44,300 --> 00:33:46,090
has anything you would exit with a

803
00:33:46,090 --> 00:33:49,010
nonzero code would words fail the CI we

804
00:33:49,010 --> 00:33:50,960
thought this will be great we're putting

805
00:33:50,960 --> 00:33:52,610
the security reports in front of the

806
00:33:52,610 --> 00:33:54,500
devs they can adopt it they can make it

807
00:33:54,500 --> 00:33:58,970
work it didn't and the reason it didn't

808
00:33:58,970 --> 00:34:03,770
work is because the test itself was

809
00:34:03,770 --> 00:34:06,290
clunky it didn't integrate well it

810
00:34:06,290 --> 00:34:07,820
didn't work with it was heavy it was

811
00:34:07,820 --> 00:34:11,929
slow at times and we would integrate it

812
00:34:11,929 --> 00:34:15,110
into a bunch of applications and over

813
00:34:15,110 --> 00:34:17,000
time they will disable it or it would go

814
00:34:17,000 --> 00:34:18,679
away when I kid will fail one time and

815
00:34:18,679 --> 00:34:20,840
block a deployment and that didn't work

816
00:34:20,840 --> 00:34:23,540
and that was an interesting surprise for

817
00:34:23,540 --> 00:34:24,889
me because I talk about test-driven

818
00:34:24,889 --> 00:34:26,840
security quite a bit in the book and I I

819
00:34:26,840 --> 00:34:28,310
strongly believe that integrating

820
00:34:28,310 --> 00:34:30,020
security testing pipeline is the way to

821
00:34:30,020 --> 00:34:30,380
go

822
00:34:30,380 --> 00:34:32,929
but not always sometimes it just doesn't

823
00:34:32,929 --> 00:34:35,810
work but we learned something we're

824
00:34:35,810 --> 00:34:39,050
doing this we learned that the idea of

825
00:34:39,050 --> 00:34:41,270
the baseline the core of the baseline

826
00:34:41,270 --> 00:34:44,060
was actually very well accepted by the

827
00:34:44,060 --> 00:34:46,280
developers they liked a lot having the

828
00:34:46,280 --> 00:34:47,929
expectations in front of them when they

829
00:34:47,929 --> 00:34:50,540
started implementing things so we turned

830
00:34:50,540 --> 00:34:53,540
that into a checklist and we grew that

831
00:34:53,540 --> 00:34:54,830
checklist over time you can see it it's

832
00:34:54,830 --> 00:34:57,680
a it's actually open github calm Mozilla

833
00:34:57,680 --> 00:35:01,940
services website - check and it's very

834
00:35:01,940 --> 00:35:03,320
long there's a bunch of stuff in it it

835
00:35:03,320 --> 00:35:05,120
really grew over time it's in markdown

836
00:35:05,120 --> 00:35:08,030
format because we use github a lot and

837
00:35:08,030 --> 00:35:10,970
when we review a project we'll copy and

838
00:35:10,970 --> 00:35:13,910
paste the checklist into an issue of the

839
00:35:13,910 --> 00:35:16,850
application and we will check off the

840
00:35:16,850 --> 00:35:18,080
stuff that doesn't apply to that

841
00:35:18,080 --> 00:35:20,000
particular app because obviously they

842
00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:21,590
don't do everything we talked about in

843
00:35:21,590 --> 00:35:23,930
the checklist and then we will ask the

844
00:35:23,930 --> 00:35:26,900
devs right before you go to prod could

845
00:35:26,900 --> 00:35:29,690
you please go through the checklist and

846
00:35:29,690 --> 00:35:31,910
make sure that everything's covered and

847
00:35:31,910 --> 00:35:35,210
something interesting happened the devs

848
00:35:35,210 --> 00:35:37,940
liked it the product managers and the

849
00:35:37,940 --> 00:35:39,980
engineering managers loved it they had a

850
00:35:39,980 --> 00:35:41,330
clear set of expectation they could

851
00:35:41,330 --> 00:35:43,040
think about reason about before shipping

852
00:35:43,040 --> 00:35:46,010
a product to production and they will

853
00:35:46,010 --> 00:35:49,570
actually put the checklist in their own

854
00:35:49,570 --> 00:35:52,490
readiness checklist so before they would

855
00:35:52,490 --> 00:35:54,800
ship something to product they would

856
00:35:54,800 --> 00:35:56,690
actually make sure the checklist was

857
00:35:56,690 --> 00:35:57,359
done

858
00:35:57,359 --> 00:36:00,989
super-powerful for us and another aspect

859
00:36:00,989 --> 00:36:03,509
that I think really helped us is that we

860
00:36:03,509 --> 00:36:06,569
had a self-assessment tool could

861
00:36:06,569 --> 00:36:09,869
observatory that was another org that

862
00:36:09,869 --> 00:36:12,150
checks for the same stuff the not all of

863
00:36:12,150 --> 00:36:13,499
it but a bunch of stuff that checklists

864
00:36:13,499 --> 00:36:16,229
extra checks for and will output a

865
00:36:16,229 --> 00:36:18,989
letter grade now there is a very

866
00:36:18,989 --> 00:36:21,950
interesting aspect about grading

867
00:36:21,950 --> 00:36:26,039
something they said nobody wants to ship

868
00:36:26,039 --> 00:36:29,489
a production service that grades with an

869
00:36:29,489 --> 00:36:33,269
F and when you put that in front of them

870
00:36:33,269 --> 00:36:35,509
particularly at Mozilla where

871
00:36:35,509 --> 00:36:37,650
observatory's our own tool it's used

872
00:36:37,650 --> 00:36:40,200
well beyond Mozilla but we don't want to

873
00:36:40,200 --> 00:36:42,809
ship a new product or a new website that

874
00:36:42,809 --> 00:36:45,119
on our own tool will create with an F

875
00:36:45,119 --> 00:36:48,119
it's kind of city we did it once or

876
00:36:48,119 --> 00:36:49,979
twice we got called out by the community

877
00:36:49,979 --> 00:36:51,450
we don't do it anymore

878
00:36:51,450 --> 00:36:54,019
everything we ship to production now

879
00:36:54,019 --> 00:36:56,779
last week or two weeks ago we ship

880
00:36:56,779 --> 00:36:59,249
Private Network that Firefox dot-com

881
00:36:59,249 --> 00:37:01,949
it's pretty cool the website for that

882
00:37:01,949 --> 00:37:03,989
got an A+ I think that's the one I used

883
00:37:03,989 --> 00:37:05,719
as an example here yeah

884
00:37:05,719 --> 00:37:08,400
self-service really works well so the

885
00:37:08,400 --> 00:37:10,969
lesson here is clear expectations

886
00:37:10,969 --> 00:37:14,729
checklists self-assessment is how you

887
00:37:14,729 --> 00:37:17,609
win you make it really really clear make

888
00:37:17,609 --> 00:37:19,469
it very easy for your devs to assess

889
00:37:19,469 --> 00:37:27,779
themselves they will use it now I have a

890
00:37:27,779 --> 00:37:29,489
few more things to say let's speed up a

891
00:37:29,489 --> 00:37:30,329
bit because I don't want to take over

892
00:37:30,329 --> 00:37:31,350
time

893
00:37:31,350 --> 00:37:33,300
but one important thing I want to talk

894
00:37:33,300 --> 00:37:35,850
about is not having to say no and we we

895
00:37:35,850 --> 00:37:37,140
touched on this a bit I'm gonna give you

896
00:37:37,140 --> 00:37:40,260
my perspective make of that you know

897
00:37:40,260 --> 00:37:43,080
what you want I have a little one at

898
00:37:43,080 --> 00:37:45,240
home she's just over a year old it's at

899
00:37:45,240 --> 00:37:47,340
the edge where they start working and

900
00:37:47,340 --> 00:37:49,290
from a threat modeling perspective it's

901
00:37:49,290 --> 00:37:53,010
absolutely terrifying because she runs

902
00:37:53,010 --> 00:37:55,560
around and like everything to me looks

903
00:37:55,560 --> 00:37:57,930
like a weapon it's like the spoon the

904
00:37:57,930 --> 00:38:00,930
cat the dog don't eat that knife can you

905
00:38:00,930 --> 00:38:03,030
please get off the stairs everything

906
00:38:03,030 --> 00:38:05,040
looks like a weapon everything is

907
00:38:05,040 --> 00:38:09,180
dangerous right and by the way you can

908
00:38:09,180 --> 00:38:11,730
actually buy like a bubble wrap baby

909
00:38:11,730 --> 00:38:15,750
suit and put a bunch of duct tape around

910
00:38:15,750 --> 00:38:18,660
it and it that works right but so the

911
00:38:18,660 --> 00:38:20,550
point is what I really really want to do

912
00:38:20,550 --> 00:38:22,770
is to take my baby put her in a safe

913
00:38:22,770 --> 00:38:24,570
place and say alright don't grow up stay

914
00:38:24,570 --> 00:38:26,430
here you're fine nothing's gonna happen

915
00:38:26,430 --> 00:38:29,280
to you but realistically that's probably

916
00:38:29,280 --> 00:38:33,300
not gonna happen there's a personal hero

917
00:38:33,300 --> 00:38:36,770
of mine Rear Admiral Grace Hopper

918
00:38:36,770 --> 00:38:40,400
fantastic fantastic woman and she quoted

919
00:38:40,400 --> 00:38:42,930
actually not their debates whether the

920
00:38:42,930 --> 00:38:44,700
quote is from her or not but let's say

921
00:38:44,700 --> 00:38:46,830
it's from her ships are safe in Harbor

922
00:38:46,830 --> 00:38:49,980
but that's not what ships are for they

923
00:38:49,980 --> 00:38:52,740
useless in Harbor I can't keep my kid in

924
00:38:52,740 --> 00:38:54,240
a playpen for the next 20 years that's

925
00:38:54,240 --> 00:38:55,710
not gonna work you can't keep your

926
00:38:55,710 --> 00:38:57,300
organization in the playpen for the next

927
00:38:57,300 --> 00:39:02,360
20 years now a lot of security team

928
00:39:02,360 --> 00:39:06,870
Paterno nice it's okay to do it when

929
00:39:06,870 --> 00:39:09,210
your dad or I guess a mom

930
00:39:09,210 --> 00:39:12,420
Ken Patera has moments but it's not okay

931
00:39:12,420 --> 00:39:14,460
to do it when your security team the

932
00:39:14,460 --> 00:39:16,350
organization is not your one your kid

933
00:39:16,350 --> 00:39:19,620
the organization is made of adults they

934
00:39:19,620 --> 00:39:22,230
take risks they make decisions your job

935
00:39:22,230 --> 00:39:25,470
is to inform them it's not to tell them

936
00:39:25,470 --> 00:39:27,930
no is to help them make the right

937
00:39:27,930 --> 00:39:30,180
decisions maybe reshape the design don't

938
00:39:30,180 --> 00:39:32,120
patronize that's not your job

939
00:39:32,120 --> 00:39:36,840
so and Mozilla we do what we call a

940
00:39:36,840 --> 00:39:39,990
rapid risk assessment sorry for the URL

941
00:39:39,990 --> 00:39:42,720
on this it's a lower conky I couldn't

942
00:39:42,720 --> 00:39:44,079
put the full one

943
00:39:44,079 --> 00:39:46,180
a rapid risk assessment is a 30 minute

944
00:39:46,180 --> 00:39:49,869
to one hour exercise where we ask the

945
00:39:49,869 --> 00:39:52,180
developers what you know could possibly

946
00:39:52,180 --> 00:39:53,500
go wrong with their application and

947
00:39:53,500 --> 00:39:55,780
we've shaped that under the the CIA

948
00:39:55,780 --> 00:39:57,099
confidentiality integrity availability

949
00:39:57,099 --> 00:40:01,270
triad and Ike what Zane said yesterday

950
00:40:01,270 --> 00:40:03,130
in the in the panel like we just sit in

951
00:40:03,130 --> 00:40:04,450
the back and ask so how would you attack

952
00:40:04,450 --> 00:40:06,280
this there's a question I like I said

953
00:40:06,280 --> 00:40:08,349
what would really happen if the database

954
00:40:08,349 --> 00:40:10,569
ends up on Twitter when you see the

955
00:40:10,569 --> 00:40:12,730
wheels turning in the heads of your debt

956
00:40:12,730 --> 00:40:14,619
and then you help them think through it

957
00:40:14,619 --> 00:40:15,940
and you keep pushing for it

958
00:40:15,940 --> 00:40:18,339
that's fret modeling and risk assessment

959
00:40:18,339 --> 00:40:20,170
you inform your organization you help

960
00:40:20,170 --> 00:40:28,089
them grow the point here is really that

961
00:40:28,089 --> 00:40:29,740
your job as a security team and how you

962
00:40:29,740 --> 00:40:31,359
succeed in all of these things and

963
00:40:31,359 --> 00:40:33,730
overtime how you go from being that

964
00:40:33,730 --> 00:40:36,369
traditional security burden to really

965
00:40:36,369 --> 00:40:38,500
enabling a granny organization is in

966
00:40:38,500 --> 00:40:41,010
being strategic you need to pick

967
00:40:41,010 --> 00:40:42,970
specific battles that help your

968
00:40:42,970 --> 00:40:47,260
organization grow I like have a few

969
00:40:47,260 --> 00:40:51,819
example but you have to basically

970
00:40:51,819 --> 00:40:53,710
understand what your organization is

971
00:40:53,710 --> 00:40:56,440
concerned about maybe the latest fad

972
00:40:56,440 --> 00:41:00,160
isn't something that you need maybe it

973
00:41:00,160 --> 00:41:03,040
is maybe I have an example I like

974
00:41:03,040 --> 00:41:05,020
everybody talks about zero trust zero

975
00:41:05,020 --> 00:41:06,460
trust they were saying put everything on

976
00:41:06,460 --> 00:41:07,900
the internet it's fantastic

977
00:41:07,900 --> 00:41:09,940
guess what I put my admin panels behind

978
00:41:09,940 --> 00:41:13,720
VPNs I do zero trust we have a single

979
00:41:13,720 --> 00:41:15,549
sign-on and everything but the

980
00:41:15,549 --> 00:41:16,930
authentication layer keeps breaking

981
00:41:16,930 --> 00:41:19,900
every three months so we want defense in

982
00:41:19,900 --> 00:41:22,510
test so we use a new shiny thing but we

983
00:41:22,510 --> 00:41:23,920
also made a strategic decision that

984
00:41:23,920 --> 00:41:25,480
everything that carries a certain amount

985
00:41:25,480 --> 00:41:27,640
of weight will also get a VPN in

986
00:41:27,640 --> 00:41:30,160
addition to the shiny thing that's a

987
00:41:30,160 --> 00:41:32,559
strategic decision another one is I

988
00:41:32,559 --> 00:41:34,630
think it is very important to allow

989
00:41:34,630 --> 00:41:37,960
applications to blow up you can prevent

990
00:41:37,960 --> 00:41:40,599
everything from exploding ever so when I

991
00:41:40,599 --> 00:41:42,670
prefer to do is to put things in small

992
00:41:42,670 --> 00:41:46,150
compartments where if something blows up

993
00:41:46,150 --> 00:41:47,470
it's not going to take the entire

994
00:41:47,470 --> 00:41:49,030
infrastructure with it and that way you

995
00:41:49,030 --> 00:41:51,369
can let people innovate you can let them

996
00:41:51,369 --> 00:41:53,650
take risks without having to worry about

997
00:41:53,650 --> 00:41:56,160
everything else

998
00:41:56,270 --> 00:41:58,440
you need to over communicate the

999
00:41:58,440 --> 00:42:00,299
strategic decisions you need to make

1000
00:42:00,299 --> 00:42:02,460
sure again that your security champions

1001
00:42:02,460 --> 00:42:04,230
are on board and help shape that that

1002
00:42:04,230 --> 00:42:05,579
they agree with it that they have a

1003
00:42:05,579 --> 00:42:09,000
chance to maybe change it a little bit

1004
00:42:09,000 --> 00:42:13,049
and ultimately what you really want to

1005
00:42:13,049 --> 00:42:15,420
do if you want to go beyond the security

1006
00:42:15,420 --> 00:42:19,440
team is to put your security team a

1007
00:42:19,440 --> 00:42:22,619
whole lot closer to your organization up

1008
00:42:22,619 --> 00:42:25,710
until the point where hopefully they

1009
00:42:25,710 --> 00:42:27,990
don't need us anymore thank you very

1010
00:42:27,990 --> 00:42:38,460
much I won't have time for questions but

1011
00:42:38,460 --> 00:42:40,530
I'll be around I think or yeah we can go

1012
00:42:40,530 --> 00:42:49,950
her kitchen any questions sure we are

1013
00:42:49,950 --> 00:42:52,530
mostly a distributed organization at the

1014
00:42:52,530 --> 00:42:56,430
moment we do have a security leadership

1015
00:42:56,430 --> 00:43:00,119
at the sea level but we have security

1016
00:43:00,119 --> 00:43:01,980
teams that are mostly embedded in very

1017
00:43:01,980 --> 00:43:06,359
parts of the organization and we're a

1018
00:43:06,359 --> 00:43:08,460
fairly big organization 1,200 people and

1019
00:43:08,460 --> 00:43:11,520
that seems to work well for us I I do

1020
00:43:11,520 --> 00:43:14,730
believe that at some point we probably

1021
00:43:14,730 --> 00:43:17,040
will go back to like an embedded model I

1022
00:43:17,040 --> 00:43:21,450
think it's a it's a matter of well it

1023
00:43:21,450 --> 00:43:23,010
depends mozilla is weird because we're

1024
00:43:23,010 --> 00:43:24,540
we're not quite a corporation with more

1025
00:43:24,540 --> 00:43:26,309
fun incubator right so there's like

1026
00:43:26,309 --> 00:43:29,460
firefox and then a million other small

1027
00:43:29,460 --> 00:43:31,170
projects where you can't just take the

1028
00:43:31,170 --> 00:43:32,490
security team of firefox and have them

1029
00:43:32,490 --> 00:43:34,410
cover everything else right so that's

1030
00:43:34,410 --> 00:43:35,970
why I like the the distributed model

1031
00:43:35,970 --> 00:43:37,410
seems to work kind of a little bit

1032
00:43:37,410 --> 00:43:39,480
better for us but even within Firefox

1033
00:43:39,480 --> 00:43:40,950
like I work on fire so specifically

1034
00:43:40,950 --> 00:43:42,180
we're talking about a camp an

1035
00:43:42,180 --> 00:43:43,890
organization of like over 500 people

1036
00:43:43,890 --> 00:43:46,650
there inside of that group we operate

1037
00:43:46,650 --> 00:43:48,390
more on the centralized model where my

1038
00:43:48,390 --> 00:43:51,809
team will for example cover something

1039
00:43:51,809 --> 00:43:54,720
like 70 80 products and services and

1040
00:43:54,720 --> 00:43:56,790
people in my team would be embedded in

1041
00:43:56,790 --> 00:43:58,440
the various teams that cover these

1042
00:43:58,440 --> 00:44:00,780
products and services right it's a very

1043
00:44:00,780 --> 00:44:03,589
hybrid model

1044
00:44:24,109 --> 00:44:28,170
so mostly we wear a state of maturity

1045
00:44:28,170 --> 00:44:31,710
where the people who in my group spend

1046
00:44:31,710 --> 00:44:34,470
most of their time engineering new

1047
00:44:34,470 --> 00:44:36,390
security control security features and

1048
00:44:36,390 --> 00:44:40,460
the embedding really means that they are

1049
00:44:40,460 --> 00:44:43,589
consulting with the various engineering

1050
00:44:43,589 --> 00:44:44,640
team so they are close to them they

1051
00:44:44,640 --> 00:44:46,170
answer their questions if a new

1052
00:44:46,170 --> 00:44:47,760
application comes up it needs a code

1053
00:44:47,760 --> 00:44:50,670
review it needs whatever then they will

1054
00:44:50,670 --> 00:44:52,470
pick it up right they will tell me hey

1055
00:44:52,470 --> 00:44:53,550
by the way I'm going to spend two days

1056
00:44:53,550 --> 00:44:55,890
doing X for these guys and and that's

1057
00:44:55,890 --> 00:44:57,809
how we'll cover it but where the level

1058
00:44:57,809 --> 00:45:00,660
of maturity where most of first time

1059
00:45:00,660 --> 00:45:01,890
like I showed in the first night is

1060
00:45:01,890 --> 00:45:04,020
invested to an engineering security

1061
00:45:04,020 --> 00:45:06,000
services and security controls and

1062
00:45:06,000 --> 00:45:07,500
regression test and all that stuff and

1063
00:45:07,500 --> 00:45:09,720
maturing that part and we don't do a

1064
00:45:09,720 --> 00:45:12,650
whole lot of work and more security work

1065
00:45:12,650 --> 00:45:15,869
does that yeah I can expand on it after

1066
00:45:15,869 --> 00:45:19,710
if you want okay thank you please give

1067
00:45:19,710 --> 00:45:22,309
it up for Julia

1068
00:45:25,009 --> 00:45:26,939
okay so there's one more session before

1069
00:45:26,939 --> 00:45:30,390
the break we have in this room we have

1070
00:45:30,390 --> 00:45:32,369
see I can make dollars from thin air

1071
00:45:32,369 --> 00:45:34,559
from Sahib and we also have a workshop

1072
00:45:34,559 --> 00:45:36,420
starting as well downstairs and that is

1073
00:45:36,420 --> 00:45:38,759
tournament the ultimate secure coding

1074
00:45:38,759 --> 00:45:41,009
throw down from brat and then there'll

1075
00:45:41,009 --> 00:45:43,589
be a break at approximately 11:00 after

1076
00:45:43,589 --> 00:45:45,180
that so if you want to make your way to

1077
00:45:45,180 --> 00:45:47,069
the rooms that you want to see the

1078
00:45:47,069 --> 00:45:47,999
sessions in and we'll start in a couple

1079
00:45:47,999 --> 00:45:50,359
of minutes
