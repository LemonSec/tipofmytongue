[Music]

2
00:00:04,640 --> 00:00:07,680
let's stay motivated let's say the folk

3
00:00:07,680 --> 00:00:09,440
let's stay focused and

4
00:00:09,440 --> 00:00:11,840
um uplift ourselves

5
00:00:11,840 --> 00:00:13,679
if nobody else is doing

6
00:00:13,679 --> 00:00:16,079
definitely that's very important and and

7
00:00:16,079 --> 00:00:18,160
we do have a very interesting person on

8
00:00:18,160 --> 00:00:20,800
the session with you with with us

9
00:00:20,800 --> 00:00:23,519
and we just met like a

10
00:00:23,519 --> 00:00:24,960
few days ago

11
00:00:24,960 --> 00:00:26,880
it was very amazing so let me just bring

12
00:00:26,880 --> 00:00:28,560
him in and then we can talk more about

13
00:00:28,560 --> 00:00:29,359
him

14
00:00:29,359 --> 00:00:32,558
definitely here we are

15
00:00:32,558 --> 00:00:33,760
how are you

16
00:00:33,760 --> 00:00:35,200
if we're seeing another co-worker on the

17
00:00:35,200 --> 00:00:36,640
other side and go hey

18
00:00:36,640 --> 00:00:38,160
yeah

19
00:00:38,160 --> 00:00:40,879
in the same time

20
00:00:41,120 --> 00:00:43,360
we do have a interesting talk from you

21
00:00:43,360 --> 00:00:45,440
coming up so building security champion

22
00:00:45,440 --> 00:00:47,280
program in a hybrid world which i think

23
00:00:47,280 --> 00:00:50,239
you're sharing your own personal wins

24
00:00:50,239 --> 00:00:52,879
and you know not wins as well um i think

25
00:00:52,879 --> 00:00:54,239
we heard a really good talk from right

26
00:00:54,239 --> 00:00:55,039
now

27
00:00:55,039 --> 00:00:56,960
people may cry after that as well yeah

28
00:00:56,960 --> 00:00:58,480
crying moments that seems to be the

29
00:00:58,480 --> 00:00:59,280
theme

30
00:00:59,280 --> 00:01:01,280
today i think randall shared some of his

31
00:01:01,280 --> 00:01:02,960
as well and it's just learning from each

32
00:01:02,960 --> 00:01:04,319
other and i guess

33
00:01:04,319 --> 00:01:06,240
failures and successes so you know we

34
00:01:06,240 --> 00:01:08,880
kind of don't make them um ourselves so

35
00:01:08,880 --> 00:01:10,960
well we might throw to you um for the

36
00:01:10,960 --> 00:01:13,040
talk so take it away

37
00:01:13,040 --> 00:01:14,799
sounds good uh awesome thank you for

38
00:01:14,799 --> 00:01:16,400
this opportunity and thank you to

39
00:01:16,400 --> 00:01:18,000
everyone who's making this possible as

40
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:18,720
well

41
00:01:18,720 --> 00:01:20,320
um obviously i just want to give a quick

42
00:01:20,320 --> 00:01:21,520
shout out to the awards thing as well

43
00:01:21,520 --> 00:01:22,720
i'm definitely going to put my name in

44
00:01:22,720 --> 00:01:24,479
so if you are looking at putting a name

45
00:01:24,479 --> 00:01:26,720
i think uh or mondana said is true just

46
00:01:26,720 --> 00:01:29,600
definitely don't forget to recognize the

47
00:01:29,600 --> 00:01:30,960
awesome work you're doing yourself as

48
00:01:30,960 --> 00:01:31,680
well

49
00:01:31,680 --> 00:01:33,920
correct osu to talk so today i'm talking

50
00:01:33,920 --> 00:01:35,520
about building security champions in a

51
00:01:35,520 --> 00:01:38,159
hybrid remote world so the story is my

52
00:01:38,159 --> 00:01:40,799
personal story i have mercy so and i've

53
00:01:40,799 --> 00:01:43,759
been a cso for a while and my most

54
00:01:43,759 --> 00:01:46,159
recent job when i work at the moment i

55
00:01:46,159 --> 00:01:48,320
was doing the cso work as a remote

56
00:01:48,320 --> 00:01:49,840
employee i

57
00:01:49,840 --> 00:01:51,920
melbourne where i'm based out of went

58
00:01:51,920 --> 00:01:54,079
into lockdown and i got the joke pretty

59
00:01:54,079 --> 00:01:56,399
much uh i think a week before or

60
00:01:56,399 --> 00:01:58,159
something and the entire country went to

61
00:01:58,159 --> 00:02:01,200
lockdown so this is the story of what my

62
00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:03,600
i guess my shortcomings so others can

63
00:02:03,600 --> 00:02:05,280
learn from it and hopefully some of the

64
00:02:05,280 --> 00:02:06,719
things that worked for me and i guess

65
00:02:06,719 --> 00:02:08,959
building a security champion program

66
00:02:08,959 --> 00:02:11,120
while i was in a semi-hybrid a full

67
00:02:11,120 --> 00:02:12,959
remote kind of world as well

68
00:02:12,959 --> 00:02:15,680
let's see if this works sweet so a

69
00:02:15,680 --> 00:02:17,520
little bit a little bit about who i am

70
00:02:17,520 --> 00:02:19,760
so i host the cloud security podcast

71
00:02:19,760 --> 00:02:21,680
which uh shelby is the producer for

72
00:02:21,680 --> 00:02:23,680
doing an awesome job clearly

73
00:02:23,680 --> 00:02:25,920
and i'm also as i've mentioned nine to

74
00:02:25,920 --> 00:02:28,239
five is my cso job but

75
00:02:28,239 --> 00:02:30,480
outside of all that i also create uh

76
00:02:30,480 --> 00:02:33,280
content for sense which is a popular

77
00:02:33,280 --> 00:02:35,120
cyber security institute

78
00:02:35,120 --> 00:02:36,560
which has been providing cloud security

79
00:02:36,560 --> 00:02:37,760
information and cyber security

80
00:02:37,760 --> 00:02:39,360
information for years so i'm a trainer

81
00:02:39,360 --> 00:02:41,519
there as well teaching others he shows

82
00:02:41,519 --> 00:02:43,680
how to do cloud security so we are

83
00:02:43,680 --> 00:02:44,720
currently on the world tour and that's

84
00:02:44,720 --> 00:02:46,160
what one that i was referring to we kind

85
00:02:46,160 --> 00:02:48,239
of met a couple of days ago at rsa in

86
00:02:48,239 --> 00:02:50,480
san francisco next stop is boston so for

87
00:02:50,480 --> 00:02:52,319
people who may be in boston for aws

88
00:02:52,319 --> 00:02:55,040
reinforce we'll see you there

89
00:02:55,040 --> 00:02:58,800
all right um so just based on the little

90
00:02:58,800 --> 00:03:00,239
information that i have from people who

91
00:03:00,239 --> 00:03:01,920
are here i'm just leveling up the

92
00:03:01,920 --> 00:03:04,239
playing field for folks who may or may

93
00:03:04,239 --> 00:03:06,080
not be familiar with the world of

94
00:03:06,080 --> 00:03:08,159
devsecops and what is it really a need

95
00:03:08,159 --> 00:03:10,319
for a security champions program

96
00:03:10,319 --> 00:03:11,519
for people who are from a technical

97
00:03:11,519 --> 00:03:14,000
background they might see a security

98
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:16,400
champions program as making others do

99
00:03:16,400 --> 00:03:18,159
the right thing which is kind of

100
00:03:18,159 --> 00:03:20,319
partially true but the other half of it

101
00:03:20,319 --> 00:03:22,640
is kind of more soft skill in terms of

102
00:03:22,640 --> 00:03:24,000
how do you

103
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:25,680
train other people who may not be from

104
00:03:25,680 --> 00:03:28,319
security on why they should do security

105
00:03:28,319 --> 00:03:30,239
and why it's the right thing to do

106
00:03:30,239 --> 00:03:32,879
now a usual way a security leader maybe

107
00:03:32,879 --> 00:03:35,599
an apsec program a lead or a cso make or

108
00:03:35,599 --> 00:03:37,519
about this would be as part of the

109
00:03:37,519 --> 00:03:39,200
security strategy they would have

110
00:03:39,200 --> 00:03:40,879
something called a death death secours

111
00:03:40,879 --> 00:03:41,840
program

112
00:03:41,840 --> 00:03:43,360
and even though i might go through the

113
00:03:43,360 --> 00:03:45,680
entire slide deck it seems like a hey 30

114
00:03:45,680 --> 00:03:46,879
minutes and you have the security

115
00:03:46,879 --> 00:03:49,040
champions program what i would call out

116
00:03:49,040 --> 00:03:50,480
we have been working on this for the

117
00:03:50,480 --> 00:03:52,959
past couple of years and we still feel

118
00:03:52,959 --> 00:03:54,720
we're still scratching the surface so it

119
00:03:54,720 --> 00:03:56,239
does take time so that's why it's a

120
00:03:56,239 --> 00:03:58,560
program and similarly for security

121
00:03:58,560 --> 00:04:00,480
champions program i would say

122
00:04:00,480 --> 00:04:02,640
it is a subset of devsecours program

123
00:04:02,640 --> 00:04:04,959
where you have your devsecops tool and

124
00:04:04,959 --> 00:04:06,400
you can check out sneak as well they

125
00:04:06,400 --> 00:04:07,840
have a great tool which kind of

126
00:04:07,840 --> 00:04:09,439
integrates really well into their space

127
00:04:09,439 --> 00:04:10,720
but there are others as well that you

128
00:04:10,720 --> 00:04:13,200
can look into the idea from a tooling

129
00:04:13,200 --> 00:04:14,720
perspective that's great from a security

130
00:04:14,720 --> 00:04:17,120
folks but the ultimately and this is

131
00:04:17,120 --> 00:04:18,639
where for people who haven't been sick

132
00:04:18,639 --> 00:04:20,560
of hearing the shift leftward the re

133
00:04:20,560 --> 00:04:22,800
there's a reason why this is uh still

134
00:04:22,800 --> 00:04:24,720
being used is because we're trying to

135
00:04:24,720 --> 00:04:26,400
call out the fact that security teams

136
00:04:26,400 --> 00:04:28,800
need to have these kind of tools whether

137
00:04:28,800 --> 00:04:30,639
it's sneak or any other security product

138
00:04:30,639 --> 00:04:32,400
that are out there that can integrate

139
00:04:32,400 --> 00:04:35,120
into a ci cd pipeline and for people who

140
00:04:35,120 --> 00:04:36,639
don't know what cicd pipeline is that's

141
00:04:36,639 --> 00:04:38,720
what a lot of people use to automate a

142
00:04:38,720 --> 00:04:40,639
lot of the deployments of this software

143
00:04:40,639 --> 00:04:41,680
on

144
00:04:41,680 --> 00:04:43,840
either a cloud or a non-cloud

145
00:04:43,840 --> 00:04:45,680
product version for other customers to

146
00:04:45,680 --> 00:04:47,520
use so hopefully that kind of gives you

147
00:04:47,520 --> 00:04:49,520
some idea for what shift left and def

148
00:04:49,520 --> 00:04:50,960
secours program and security champions

149
00:04:50,960 --> 00:04:53,120
program is and

150
00:04:53,120 --> 00:04:54,720
the depth sec of

151
00:04:54,720 --> 00:04:56,160
patent everyone has a different

152
00:04:56,160 --> 00:04:57,840
definition of it but i think the

153
00:04:57,840 --> 00:05:01,039
simplest way to define it probably is

154
00:05:01,039 --> 00:05:02,880
and i'm gonna really simplify it without

155
00:05:02,880 --> 00:05:04,720
any of the technical jargons if you're

156
00:05:04,720 --> 00:05:06,479
looking at automating

157
00:05:06,479 --> 00:05:09,120
the deployment of a product like suppose

158
00:05:09,120 --> 00:05:10,880
you have a new app that you want to

159
00:05:10,880 --> 00:05:12,479
download and or maybe you want to

160
00:05:12,479 --> 00:05:14,560
release onto the apple app store

161
00:05:14,560 --> 00:05:16,320
how do you make it happen say within a

162
00:05:16,320 --> 00:05:17,919
week that sounds almost like an

163
00:05:17,919 --> 00:05:20,160
impossible task if the app store um

164
00:05:20,160 --> 00:05:21,600
there were a lot of complications around

165
00:05:21,600 --> 00:05:24,560
it but the devsecops idea is instilled

166
00:05:24,560 --> 00:05:26,639
from devops which is around automation

167
00:05:26,639 --> 00:05:28,800
and how do you release products faster

168
00:05:28,800 --> 00:05:30,880
into the market and devsecops is

169
00:05:30,880 --> 00:05:33,520
integrating security into it uh because

170
00:05:33,520 --> 00:05:35,759
as always i'm gonna do a bad joke over

171
00:05:35,759 --> 00:05:38,000
here guess what the security people told

172
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:39,680
the developers

173
00:05:39,680 --> 00:05:42,160
nothing so that's why and the other way

174
00:05:42,160 --> 00:05:43,520
around works the same as well i don't

175
00:05:43,520 --> 00:05:44,880
know if any how many like people like

176
00:05:44,880 --> 00:05:47,039
the joke but i enjoyed it so that's why

177
00:05:47,039 --> 00:05:48,880
i call this out uh so that's the

178
00:05:48,880 --> 00:05:50,960
devsecops is definitely something that

179
00:05:50,960 --> 00:05:53,680
has become uh the i guess

180
00:05:53,680 --> 00:05:55,840
uh the the thing that is represented in

181
00:05:55,840 --> 00:05:58,160
automating security into a crc python so

182
00:05:58,160 --> 00:05:59,680
it can release faster in a much more

183
00:05:59,680 --> 00:06:01,600
safer way

184
00:06:01,600 --> 00:06:02,479
now

185
00:06:02,479 --> 00:06:03,680
a lot of people who maybe from a

186
00:06:03,680 --> 00:06:05,360
technical background may approach a

187
00:06:05,360 --> 00:06:08,080
devsecops uh program in a in a very

188
00:06:08,080 --> 00:06:10,000
technical way as i was saying earlier

189
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:11,520
the security folks who may be looking at

190
00:06:11,520 --> 00:06:13,360
a deaf circle program go well i need to

191
00:06:13,360 --> 00:06:15,520
upskill my team at the moment they might

192
00:06:15,520 --> 00:06:17,360
not may not be an abstract person or

193
00:06:17,360 --> 00:06:19,440
application security person how do i

194
00:06:19,440 --> 00:06:21,680
upskill them what are some of my common

195
00:06:21,680 --> 00:06:23,360
uh abstract problems that i need to deal

196
00:06:23,360 --> 00:06:25,360
with in my organization what kind of

197
00:06:25,360 --> 00:06:27,120
tools maybe sneak or other tools that i

198
00:06:27,120 --> 00:06:28,880
can include in my

199
00:06:28,880 --> 00:06:30,080
say the

200
00:06:30,080 --> 00:06:31,840
product that i have on releasing them

201
00:06:31,840 --> 00:06:33,919
sooner but also i can integrate then and

202
00:06:33,919 --> 00:06:35,360
make sure i can block everything which

203
00:06:35,360 --> 00:06:37,759
is probably a bad way to go about it but

204
00:06:37,759 --> 00:06:39,360
you will hear more about it as i go into

205
00:06:39,360 --> 00:06:40,880
my story because the first time i tried

206
00:06:40,880 --> 00:06:43,039
running this program i was a technical

207
00:06:43,039 --> 00:06:43,840
lead

208
00:06:43,840 --> 00:06:45,840
and it totally bombed on me so this was

209
00:06:45,840 --> 00:06:47,199
my thinking when i was a technical

210
00:06:47,199 --> 00:06:49,199
person trying to run a test course

211
00:06:49,199 --> 00:06:50,800
program because my csu was nice enough

212
00:06:50,800 --> 00:06:52,400
to give me an opportunity

213
00:06:52,400 --> 00:06:54,160
and i did what every technical person

214
00:06:54,160 --> 00:06:56,240
out there out there would do i only

215
00:06:56,240 --> 00:06:58,400
thought about the security perspective

216
00:06:58,400 --> 00:07:00,000
not the broader context i thought

217
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:01,919
because i'm technical and i know

218
00:07:01,919 --> 00:07:03,840
automation i know def cycles tooling i

219
00:07:03,840 --> 00:07:05,599
can i can totally do this because i had

220
00:07:05,599 --> 00:07:08,160
seen enough talks at devsecops uh on

221
00:07:08,160 --> 00:07:11,199
devsecond as on devsecops and all the

222
00:07:11,199 --> 00:07:12,160
other talks that i floating on the

223
00:07:12,160 --> 00:07:13,680
internet so you know how hard this could

224
00:07:13,680 --> 00:07:14,639
be

225
00:07:14,639 --> 00:07:16,240
little did i know i was in for a big

226
00:07:16,240 --> 00:07:17,120
trouble

227
00:07:17,120 --> 00:07:18,160
now

228
00:07:18,160 --> 00:07:20,160
someone who's probably a lot more of a

229
00:07:20,160 --> 00:07:22,560
leader and not technical as i should

230
00:07:22,560 --> 00:07:24,240
have been at that point in time they

231
00:07:24,240 --> 00:07:25,520
would approach it from a business

232
00:07:25,520 --> 00:07:27,919
perspective for example they may look at

233
00:07:27,919 --> 00:07:29,440
the if i go back to the apple store

234
00:07:29,440 --> 00:07:31,680
example they might look at okay i need

235
00:07:31,680 --> 00:07:34,400
to have an app store app available by

236
00:07:34,400 --> 00:07:35,919
the end of this month

237
00:07:35,919 --> 00:07:37,919
but i also want to be doing it multiple

238
00:07:37,919 --> 00:07:39,520
times in a month so i can release

239
00:07:39,520 --> 00:07:41,039
updates whatever the new update may be

240
00:07:41,039 --> 00:07:43,360
it may be the new tick tock app for all

241
00:07:43,360 --> 00:07:46,160
i care and you want to release updates

242
00:07:46,160 --> 00:07:47,599
whether it's security updates or new

243
00:07:47,599 --> 00:07:49,840
features you want to release them faster

244
00:07:49,840 --> 00:07:52,479
now if i was the ceo of tick tock and

245
00:07:52,479 --> 00:07:54,879
that was my i guess my

246
00:07:54,879 --> 00:07:56,800
responsibility that's what i'm thinking

247
00:07:56,800 --> 00:07:58,160
about when i'm thinking about shipping

248
00:07:58,160 --> 00:08:00,879
products and faster as well as securely

249
00:08:00,879 --> 00:08:04,240
security awareness is more around how do

250
00:08:04,240 --> 00:08:06,800
we make sure that developers are aware

251
00:08:06,800 --> 00:08:07,599
of

252
00:08:07,599 --> 00:08:09,360
the backlog or the tech debt that

253
00:08:09,360 --> 00:08:12,240
they're creating as they ignore security

254
00:08:12,240 --> 00:08:14,479
and keep deploying more features

255
00:08:14,479 --> 00:08:16,560
now obviously there is a piece of

256
00:08:16,560 --> 00:08:18,000
education there as well because

257
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:19,440
technically the developers are not

258
00:08:19,440 --> 00:08:21,120
supposed to be security people they have

259
00:08:21,120 --> 00:08:23,120
to be trained into understanding why

260
00:08:23,120 --> 00:08:24,720
security is important

261
00:08:24,720 --> 00:08:26,479
how can they do security in a ci cd

262
00:08:26,479 --> 00:08:28,000
pipeline how can they do security when

263
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:30,639
writing code now whether it's tooling

264
00:08:30,639 --> 00:08:32,080
this is where the technical aspect comes

265
00:08:32,080 --> 00:08:34,240
in so the part that i missed was i need

266
00:08:34,240 --> 00:08:36,559
to educate people on this as well and

267
00:08:36,559 --> 00:08:38,719
the last but not the least is governance

268
00:08:38,719 --> 00:08:41,519
and control a lot of organizations have

269
00:08:41,519 --> 00:08:43,440
compliance requirements where

270
00:08:43,440 --> 00:08:45,120
they may be required to have some kind

271
00:08:45,120 --> 00:08:46,480
of a

272
00:08:46,480 --> 00:08:48,240
compliance checkbox or some kind of a

273
00:08:48,240 --> 00:08:50,880
gateway towards before anything goes

274
00:08:50,880 --> 00:08:52,320
into production

275
00:08:52,320 --> 00:08:54,480
that there is a gate which allows them

276
00:08:54,480 --> 00:08:56,320
to say yes this is ready for release and

277
00:08:56,320 --> 00:08:58,480
production that could be a compliance or

278
00:08:58,480 --> 00:09:00,959
government's governance requirement or

279
00:09:00,959 --> 00:09:02,720
you could be in the initial stages of

280
00:09:02,720 --> 00:09:04,880
deploying their secops so you may say

281
00:09:04,880 --> 00:09:06,560
that hey i want to be able to deploy

282
00:09:06,560 --> 00:09:08,800
multiple times into production

283
00:09:08,800 --> 00:09:10,720
but i'm not really confident in the

284
00:09:10,720 --> 00:09:12,160
beginning so i want to have some kind of

285
00:09:12,160 --> 00:09:14,480
a control stage gate in the beginning so

286
00:09:14,480 --> 00:09:15,760
i'm able to

287
00:09:15,760 --> 00:09:17,600
monitor and review things before i let

288
00:09:17,600 --> 00:09:19,120
them go into production so that's what

289
00:09:19,120 --> 00:09:20,720
the governance compliance angle is as

290
00:09:20,720 --> 00:09:22,399
well

291
00:09:22,399 --> 00:09:24,000
now this is kind of where okay i hope

292
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:25,440
you have your tissues ready because it's

293
00:09:25,440 --> 00:09:27,200
kind of where it's downhill from here

294
00:09:27,200 --> 00:09:29,600
after this so the first chance as i

295
00:09:29,600 --> 00:09:31,360
mentioned was i was in a technical lead

296
00:09:31,360 --> 00:09:34,080
role and my cso asked me to go down the

297
00:09:34,080 --> 00:09:36,640
path of doing a well at least running an

298
00:09:36,640 --> 00:09:38,320
abstract program and because i knew

299
00:09:38,320 --> 00:09:39,920
devsecops after listening to all these

300
00:09:39,920 --> 00:09:41,920
talks and the buzzwords and everything

301
00:09:41,920 --> 00:09:44,399
this was at least five years ago so i

302
00:09:44,399 --> 00:09:46,800
thought how hard could this really be so

303
00:09:46,800 --> 00:09:48,480
i went down the path of

304
00:09:48,480 --> 00:09:50,800
everything in that uh list from a

305
00:09:50,800 --> 00:09:52,959
strategy perspective i ignored

306
00:09:52,959 --> 00:09:54,320
everything except for governance and

307
00:09:54,320 --> 00:09:57,040
control so i was more focused on the

308
00:09:57,040 --> 00:09:59,120
technical aspect and i think

309
00:09:59,120 --> 00:10:00,640
some people may blame me for hey why

310
00:10:00,640 --> 00:10:02,240
would you do that but if you're gonna

311
00:10:02,240 --> 00:10:04,160
think about from a technical perspective

312
00:10:04,160 --> 00:10:05,600
because that's what you

313
00:10:05,600 --> 00:10:07,600
know in the beginning after listening to

314
00:10:07,600 --> 00:10:09,839
all the talks you kind of oh i'm going

315
00:10:09,839 --> 00:10:11,360
to do this then i'm going to focus on

316
00:10:11,360 --> 00:10:14,399
everything else and that usually

317
00:10:14,399 --> 00:10:16,399
let's just say it probably takes you

318
00:10:16,399 --> 00:10:18,959
into a rabbit hole where you may have to

319
00:10:18,959 --> 00:10:21,839
backtrack quite a few times and may have

320
00:10:21,839 --> 00:10:23,680
to uninstall and remove quite a few

321
00:10:23,680 --> 00:10:25,600
security gates that you may have added

322
00:10:25,600 --> 00:10:27,440
especially things like breaking a

323
00:10:27,440 --> 00:10:29,360
production change especially when it's

324
00:10:29,360 --> 00:10:30,480
supposed to get released and they've

325
00:10:30,480 --> 00:10:32,000
been talked conversations that are about

326
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:33,200
it for a while

327
00:10:33,200 --> 00:10:35,120
so something to call that out over there

328
00:10:35,120 --> 00:10:37,040
uh and the

329
00:10:37,040 --> 00:10:38,800
i as as i approached it they took the

330
00:10:38,800 --> 00:10:40,320
approach my

331
00:10:40,320 --> 00:10:42,079
learning from that was

332
00:10:42,079 --> 00:10:44,480
i did the mistake of going for a static

333
00:10:44,480 --> 00:10:47,360
code analysis as my first tool

334
00:10:47,360 --> 00:10:49,680
for devsecops now for people who haven't

335
00:10:49,680 --> 00:10:52,160
gone through the pain it totally sucks

336
00:10:52,160 --> 00:10:54,959
just saying that uh i probably would not

337
00:10:54,959 --> 00:10:57,200
have gone for this because the simple

338
00:10:57,200 --> 00:10:58,640
reason being

339
00:10:58,640 --> 00:11:00,720
if you're trying to deploy into a ci cd

340
00:11:00,720 --> 00:11:01,920
pipeline

341
00:11:01,920 --> 00:11:04,720
not many sas providers are out there can

342
00:11:04,720 --> 00:11:07,360
review code that quickly now there are

343
00:11:07,360 --> 00:11:08,800
exceptions to this code as well there's

344
00:11:08,800 --> 00:11:10,880
a lot more new tooling coming in but

345
00:11:10,880 --> 00:11:13,360
primarily what you find is

346
00:11:13,360 --> 00:11:15,200
most of the sas providers are still

347
00:11:15,200 --> 00:11:17,440
expecting you to upload the code or wait

348
00:11:17,440 --> 00:11:19,279
a few hours before you can even go down

349
00:11:19,279 --> 00:11:21,519
the path of say

350
00:11:21,519 --> 00:11:22,959
testing where the security is being done

351
00:11:22,959 --> 00:11:25,200
right now what this ends up being is

352
00:11:25,200 --> 00:11:27,120
that you end up having a parallel

353
00:11:27,120 --> 00:11:29,600
ci cd pipeline which is a security ci cd

354
00:11:29,600 --> 00:11:32,079
pipeline it's probably a bad idea but to

355
00:11:32,079 --> 00:11:33,200
begin with because you have to still

356
00:11:33,200 --> 00:11:34,399
come back there's no shift left

357
00:11:34,399 --> 00:11:37,519
happening so that's why i think that

358
00:11:37,519 --> 00:11:38,800
totally sucked

359
00:11:38,800 --> 00:11:41,040
and i i think i've said this before and

360
00:11:41,040 --> 00:11:42,560
it's very controversial i definitely

361
00:11:42,560 --> 00:11:45,600
feel fast as a field it's gonna die and

362
00:11:45,600 --> 00:11:47,120
i'm sure i'll get hate mail for this as

363
00:11:47,120 --> 00:11:48,320
well from here but

364
00:11:48,320 --> 00:11:50,399
the if it continues to be what it is

365
00:11:50,399 --> 00:11:52,959
today where we can't deploy

366
00:11:52,959 --> 00:11:55,760
into a production environment by running

367
00:11:55,760 --> 00:11:57,600
the sas without having to wait for a few

368
00:11:57,600 --> 00:11:59,680
hours i think the sas as it stands today

369
00:11:59,680 --> 00:12:01,040
is gonna definitely die

370
00:12:01,040 --> 00:12:02,320
some people may even call it it's gonna

371
00:12:02,320 --> 00:12:03,519
mutate into something else something

372
00:12:03,519 --> 00:12:05,680
better but as it stands right now it

373
00:12:05,680 --> 00:12:07,120
definitely is something that needs to be

374
00:12:07,120 --> 00:12:08,240
changed

375
00:12:08,240 --> 00:12:10,000
the other thing that i did a mistake on

376
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:12,560
was i ended up doing this solo because i

377
00:12:12,560 --> 00:12:14,639
want again me being a technical person i

378
00:12:14,639 --> 00:12:16,800
thought i could totally lose on my own

379
00:12:16,800 --> 00:12:19,200
i did not include much of the other

380
00:12:19,200 --> 00:12:21,279
teams developers who were supposed to be

381
00:12:21,279 --> 00:12:22,800
working with or i was supposed to work

382
00:12:22,800 --> 00:12:23,600
with

383
00:12:23,600 --> 00:12:25,920
i definitely did not go down the path of

384
00:12:25,920 --> 00:12:27,600
doing that so what that really meant is

385
00:12:27,600 --> 00:12:30,079
i was trying to deploy all these ci cd

386
00:12:30,079 --> 00:12:31,760
pipelines in silo

387
00:12:31,760 --> 00:12:33,360
and i did not

388
00:12:33,360 --> 00:12:35,360
get an opportunity to deploy it now the

389
00:12:35,360 --> 00:12:36,800
last one probably is the most important

390
00:12:36,800 --> 00:12:38,800
one lack of leader support if there is

391
00:12:38,800 --> 00:12:40,160
no initiative

392
00:12:40,160 --> 00:12:42,800
from your hire leaders say for example

393
00:12:42,800 --> 00:12:45,680
the cio or the cto or maybe the ceo as

394
00:12:45,680 --> 00:12:46,560
well

395
00:12:46,560 --> 00:12:48,720
if they are not interested in

396
00:12:48,720 --> 00:12:51,920
having security part of their devops

397
00:12:51,920 --> 00:12:54,000
pipeline then you're probably

398
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:56,000
fighting an uphill battle

399
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:57,200
now because i've left the company i can

400
00:12:57,200 --> 00:12:59,279
talk about it without naming the company

401
00:12:59,279 --> 00:13:01,839
of course but the way we kind of

402
00:13:01,839 --> 00:13:03,519
approached it we

403
00:13:03,519 --> 00:13:05,200
did the tooling we proved the concept

404
00:13:05,200 --> 00:13:08,000
worked so in our mind yep that's concept

405
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:10,079
works i can totally see why the leaders

406
00:13:10,079 --> 00:13:11,440
would say yes

407
00:13:11,440 --> 00:13:14,560
we tried a few times and it did not work

408
00:13:14,560 --> 00:13:16,399
because they said it was just a blocker

409
00:13:16,399 --> 00:13:18,639
and as i mentioned because i use sas as

410
00:13:18,639 --> 00:13:20,639
the first thing and it was waiting for

411
00:13:20,639 --> 00:13:22,800
hours so the devops people did not

412
00:13:22,800 --> 00:13:24,560
really want to work with us they

413
00:13:24,560 --> 00:13:27,040
basically said and that well we can't

414
00:13:27,040 --> 00:13:29,040
work for wait for hours because our

415
00:13:29,040 --> 00:13:31,040
deployment only takes five minutes while

416
00:13:31,040 --> 00:13:32,959
your security totally takes about half a

417
00:13:32,959 --> 00:13:35,040
day or a day before it can come back to

418
00:13:35,040 --> 00:13:37,360
us and even after that we still have to

419
00:13:37,360 --> 00:13:38,959
work through and find out how many are

420
00:13:38,959 --> 00:13:40,959
false positives and how many are not

421
00:13:40,959 --> 00:13:42,720
false positives so it's a lot of work

422
00:13:42,720 --> 00:13:43,760
being done

423
00:13:43,760 --> 00:13:46,000
for so much little effort or so little

424
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:48,720
profit from a company perspective so

425
00:13:48,720 --> 00:13:51,600
that totally tanked my cso did try and

426
00:13:51,600 --> 00:13:53,839
we did look at other approaches and by

427
00:13:53,839 --> 00:13:55,760
then it was basically

428
00:13:55,760 --> 00:13:58,399
well we had lost uh a lot of support so

429
00:13:58,399 --> 00:14:00,240
i was in in my corner crying that this

430
00:14:00,240 --> 00:14:03,600
was this was a bad thing happened uh i i

431
00:14:03,600 --> 00:14:06,160
wanted to change it but by then uh we

432
00:14:06,160 --> 00:14:07,920
decided let's focus on other programs

433
00:14:07,920 --> 00:14:08,800
and not

434
00:14:08,800 --> 00:14:10,160
uh make people remember the bad

435
00:14:10,160 --> 00:14:11,519
experience they've had with this so

436
00:14:11,519 --> 00:14:12,959
that's kind of where

437
00:14:12,959 --> 00:14:14,639
that was my learning so

438
00:14:14,639 --> 00:14:16,399
as i was talking about earlier

439
00:14:16,399 --> 00:14:18,720
at that point in time uh i consider

440
00:14:18,720 --> 00:14:21,040
myself to be level zero in deaf circle

441
00:14:21,040 --> 00:14:23,360
of skill set i was trying to be a single

442
00:14:23,360 --> 00:14:25,600
person deaf psychos person i did not

443
00:14:25,600 --> 00:14:26,800
think about the security culture of the

444
00:14:26,800 --> 00:14:28,320
organization whether i should work on

445
00:14:28,320 --> 00:14:31,120
building that first i did not i had

446
00:14:31,120 --> 00:14:33,600
cloud security skills i had the idea

447
00:14:33,600 --> 00:14:34,959
that hey i wanted to use open source

448
00:14:34,959 --> 00:14:36,000
because i was the only guy i was

449
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:37,120
technical

450
00:14:37,120 --> 00:14:39,040
so i wanted to do open source

451
00:14:39,040 --> 00:14:40,959
instead of buying a tool which sometimes

452
00:14:40,959 --> 00:14:42,320
if you think about in a scale of an

453
00:14:42,320 --> 00:14:43,680
enterprise it's probably a good idea to

454
00:14:43,680 --> 00:14:45,920
buy a tool for it instead of trying to

455
00:14:45,920 --> 00:14:48,160
find an open source version just because

456
00:14:48,160 --> 00:14:50,000
after a while you're just maintaining

457
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:51,920
custom code it just does not make sense

458
00:14:51,920 --> 00:14:55,120
when you have say over 800 repositories

459
00:14:55,120 --> 00:14:58,000
in a github account and you have to go

460
00:14:58,000 --> 00:14:59,680
through all of them and sometimes there

461
00:14:59,680 --> 00:15:01,519
might be some exceptions which is

462
00:15:01,519 --> 00:15:03,279
which would make the scenario quite

463
00:15:03,279 --> 00:15:05,440
unique so from that perspective

464
00:15:05,440 --> 00:15:06,800
i was totally level zero at that point

465
00:15:06,800 --> 00:15:08,480
in time i had no idea how i was doing

466
00:15:08,480 --> 00:15:10,560
and i was grateful that i was not fired

467
00:15:10,560 --> 00:15:11,920
for that job although i did leave it

468
00:15:11,920 --> 00:15:13,440
afterwards but that's a different story

469
00:15:13,440 --> 00:15:15,600
for very different reasons

470
00:15:15,600 --> 00:15:16,399
now

471
00:15:16,399 --> 00:15:18,079
i got this opportunity again in my

472
00:15:18,079 --> 00:15:20,320
current company and we

473
00:15:20,320 --> 00:15:22,320
went down the path of

474
00:15:22,320 --> 00:15:24,880
we had really great cloud security

475
00:15:24,880 --> 00:15:26,399
skills and we've been growing in that

476
00:15:26,399 --> 00:15:28,560
space quite a bit and we wanted to start

477
00:15:28,560 --> 00:15:30,079
an abstract program

478
00:15:30,079 --> 00:15:32,160
and this time around i didn't want to

479
00:15:32,160 --> 00:15:33,440
commit the same mistakes that i did

480
00:15:33,440 --> 00:15:35,519
before so i reached out to a few people

481
00:15:35,519 --> 00:15:37,040
and started asking about hey what's the

482
00:15:37,040 --> 00:15:38,800
right way to do devsecoff as a leader

483
00:15:38,800 --> 00:15:41,360
and that's how i came across those

484
00:15:41,360 --> 00:15:43,759
strategic viewpoint for how you should

485
00:15:43,759 --> 00:15:46,560
do cyber security deficit cost programs

486
00:15:46,560 --> 00:15:48,959
or security programs why is it important

487
00:15:48,959 --> 00:15:50,959
to have an understanding of the business

488
00:15:50,959 --> 00:15:53,040
the security culture and what else that

489
00:15:53,040 --> 00:15:55,040
goes with it as well so that was my

490
00:15:55,040 --> 00:15:56,320
second chance

491
00:15:56,320 --> 00:15:58,560
i still consider myself level one now i

492
00:15:58,560 --> 00:16:01,120
did have a few things i had the

493
00:16:01,120 --> 00:16:04,160
leadership support so that meant i had

494
00:16:04,160 --> 00:16:06,639
the budget to do developer training it

495
00:16:06,639 --> 00:16:08,959
was a great security culture um some of

496
00:16:08,959 --> 00:16:10,959
the companies that have security culture

497
00:16:10,959 --> 00:16:13,759
which is a great way to see this is like

498
00:16:13,759 --> 00:16:16,639
you can always try with the smallest

499
00:16:16,639 --> 00:16:19,040
thing first which is

500
00:16:19,040 --> 00:16:21,120
uh try and release a responsible

501
00:16:21,120 --> 00:16:22,959
disclosure program i just have a link on

502
00:16:22,959 --> 00:16:24,399
the website to say hey if you do find

503
00:16:24,399 --> 00:16:26,959
vulnerabilities report to us on this

504
00:16:26,959 --> 00:16:28,480
mailbox over here

505
00:16:28,480 --> 00:16:31,120
i found that whole thing took me like

506
00:16:31,120 --> 00:16:33,519
five minutes conversation with the cto

507
00:16:33,519 --> 00:16:34,800
and another five-minute conversation

508
00:16:34,800 --> 00:16:36,800
with ceo and we had that on the website

509
00:16:36,800 --> 00:16:39,279
so from that perspective

510
00:16:39,279 --> 00:16:41,120
i could say hey security culture is a

511
00:16:41,120 --> 00:16:43,360
tick the other example was so i had

512
00:16:43,360 --> 00:16:45,600
leadership support on security the other

513
00:16:45,600 --> 00:16:48,880
one was we're talking

514
00:17:02,480 --> 00:17:06,240
so apologies for this in the beginning

515
00:17:06,240 --> 00:17:08,720
but i'm gonna do it in the dark so

516
00:17:08,720 --> 00:17:10,959
sorry about that my a cat came in and my

517
00:17:10,959 --> 00:17:12,400
dogs are realistic

518
00:17:12,400 --> 00:17:14,480
however uh so i'll continue with my

519
00:17:14,480 --> 00:17:16,799
chalk uh so

520
00:17:16,799 --> 00:17:18,400
zoomed in camera there you go

521
00:17:18,400 --> 00:17:21,119
so the way i would approach this is i

522
00:17:21,119 --> 00:17:22,480
had developer training which is

523
00:17:22,480 --> 00:17:24,480
available at budget for it

524
00:17:24,480 --> 00:17:26,799
and i also had the

525
00:17:26,799 --> 00:17:29,440
support of my ceo as well as cto as well

526
00:17:29,440 --> 00:17:31,440
to kind of go down the spot and for a

527
00:17:31,440 --> 00:17:33,280
change i was on the only person doing

528
00:17:33,280 --> 00:17:35,679
devsecops i had two people team who were

529
00:17:35,679 --> 00:17:38,240
willing to help me out as well so i

530
00:17:38,240 --> 00:17:40,480
definitely had an initiative

531
00:17:40,480 --> 00:17:43,760
which was funded for a i guess the deaf

532
00:17:43,760 --> 00:17:45,440
secours program i had two people who

533
00:17:45,440 --> 00:17:47,440
could help me out as well i had the

534
00:17:47,440 --> 00:17:49,039
right culture in the organization my

535
00:17:49,039 --> 00:17:51,039
friend brings the finger there you go

536
00:17:51,039 --> 00:17:52,320
so i had the right culture for this as

537
00:17:52,320 --> 00:17:55,679
well now this is all great but the

538
00:17:55,679 --> 00:17:57,120
problem that i had at this point in time

539
00:17:57,120 --> 00:17:58,799
was i had the budget i had the

540
00:17:58,799 --> 00:18:01,039
developers who ready i also had the

541
00:18:01,039 --> 00:18:02,320
people who were

542
00:18:02,320 --> 00:18:03,520
ready for

543
00:18:03,520 --> 00:18:05,600
supporting this but we were in a remote

544
00:18:05,600 --> 00:18:06,880
world remember because i just started

545
00:18:06,880 --> 00:18:08,480
with the company so i've got all these

546
00:18:08,480 --> 00:18:10,160
resources and i've got everything but

547
00:18:10,160 --> 00:18:12,080
how am i going to run a program

548
00:18:12,080 --> 00:18:14,880
which is fully remote so i obviously

549
00:18:14,880 --> 00:18:16,640
focused on these things but the the

550
00:18:16,640 --> 00:18:18,480
question was going to be how do i do

551
00:18:18,480 --> 00:18:20,960
this on a on a scale which works on a

552
00:18:20,960 --> 00:18:23,280
remote context the way i went about this

553
00:18:23,280 --> 00:18:25,840
was okay i'm going to focus on education

554
00:18:25,840 --> 00:18:27,039
because i've got develop education

555
00:18:27,039 --> 00:18:29,200
budget i want to understand how the

556
00:18:29,200 --> 00:18:30,880
business is going to work

557
00:18:30,880 --> 00:18:33,520
which is to understand the need for

558
00:18:33,520 --> 00:18:34,880
what are we really trying to release

559
00:18:34,880 --> 00:18:37,520
into production really fast is it an app

560
00:18:37,520 --> 00:18:38,559
store

561
00:18:38,559 --> 00:18:40,000
which in our case was not an app store

562
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:42,000
with something else we are a sas product

563
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:44,000
but it was still around the fact that we

564
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:45,360
want to be able to release products

565
00:18:45,360 --> 00:18:47,360
faster how do you do that and how are

566
00:18:47,360 --> 00:18:49,360
you going to go about doing this in a

567
00:18:49,360 --> 00:18:51,520
way that it makes sense for the business

568
00:18:51,520 --> 00:18:52,240
so

569
00:18:52,240 --> 00:18:54,320
i had those tools in mind but the job

570
00:18:54,320 --> 00:18:56,720
that i had was to find out how do i

571
00:18:56,720 --> 00:18:58,400
start building a security champion

572
00:18:58,400 --> 00:19:00,080
security champions program

573
00:19:00,080 --> 00:19:02,480
so the way i approached it and again

574
00:19:02,480 --> 00:19:04,240
reminder this is a remote world

575
00:19:04,240 --> 00:19:06,000
everyone's working from home

576
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:07,679
i don't have the water cooler chat i

577
00:19:07,679 --> 00:19:10,799
haven't had the conversation with the

578
00:19:10,799 --> 00:19:13,200
the folks yet so how do i kind of

579
00:19:13,200 --> 00:19:14,880
approach this i approach this in a few

580
00:19:14,880 --> 00:19:16,640
different ways because i had the support

581
00:19:16,640 --> 00:19:18,080
of security

582
00:19:18,080 --> 00:19:20,400
on a sea level

583
00:19:20,400 --> 00:19:22,000
the one of the first things i proposed

584
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:24,720
was any new starter that joins

585
00:19:24,720 --> 00:19:26,080
joins the company

586
00:19:26,080 --> 00:19:28,000
they have to go through a mandatory

587
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:30,400
security awareness thing now security

588
00:19:30,400 --> 00:19:32,880
awareness training is your usual

589
00:19:32,880 --> 00:19:35,120
hey how do i identify phishing how do i

590
00:19:35,120 --> 00:19:37,760
identify spams but in addition to that

591
00:19:37,760 --> 00:19:39,679
they had to have a one-on-one session

592
00:19:39,679 --> 00:19:40,480
with

593
00:19:40,480 --> 00:19:42,960
me or one of someone member for my team

594
00:19:42,960 --> 00:19:44,320
where we talk about what are we doing

595
00:19:44,320 --> 00:19:46,320
from a devs a course perspective

596
00:19:46,320 --> 00:19:48,559
especially if they're a developer

597
00:19:48,559 --> 00:19:49,360
now

598
00:19:49,360 --> 00:19:51,280
you might think that hey but how would

599
00:19:51,280 --> 00:19:53,120
you enforce that again leadership

600
00:19:53,120 --> 00:19:54,480
support was something that was crucial

601
00:19:54,480 --> 00:19:57,520
for this so every new starter sorry

602
00:19:57,520 --> 00:20:00,000
every new starter who came in which was

603
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:01,200
um

604
00:20:01,200 --> 00:20:03,520
a developer specifically they would get

605
00:20:03,520 --> 00:20:05,760
a rundown of what our death cycles tools

606
00:20:05,760 --> 00:20:07,679
are what do we prefer what are some of

607
00:20:07,679 --> 00:20:08,960
the resources that they can use for

608
00:20:08,960 --> 00:20:11,440
learning so that worked out for new

609
00:20:11,440 --> 00:20:13,840
starters but we had a development team

610
00:20:13,840 --> 00:20:16,640
of almost 300 people how do we educate

611
00:20:16,640 --> 00:20:19,520
them on doing this activity so we

612
00:20:19,520 --> 00:20:20,960
started some running something called

613
00:20:20,960 --> 00:20:23,760
hour of power which was a program i

614
00:20:23,760 --> 00:20:26,240
guess in the beginning of the remote

615
00:20:26,240 --> 00:20:28,480
stages what worked out was we were

616
00:20:28,480 --> 00:20:30,799
trying to do a lot of activity around

617
00:20:30,799 --> 00:20:33,200
how do we keep a positive mindset now

618
00:20:33,200 --> 00:20:34,960
don't get me wrong security is not the

619
00:20:34,960 --> 00:20:35,919
first thing you're thinking of when

620
00:20:35,919 --> 00:20:36,880
you're trying to think of positive

621
00:20:36,880 --> 00:20:38,159
mindsets so

622
00:20:38,159 --> 00:20:41,039
we had to be creative what we called out

623
00:20:41,039 --> 00:20:42,320
as sessions that we were running in the

624
00:20:42,320 --> 00:20:45,039
beginning were around how do you

625
00:20:45,039 --> 00:20:47,280
remain safe on the internet

626
00:20:47,280 --> 00:20:49,679
while you are working from home

627
00:20:49,679 --> 00:20:51,440
how do you remain safe on the internet

628
00:20:51,440 --> 00:20:53,039
for your kids while you're working from

629
00:20:53,039 --> 00:20:54,080
home because a lot of people were

630
00:20:54,080 --> 00:20:56,240
sharing laptops with their kids as well

631
00:20:56,240 --> 00:20:57,919
so that session was definitely something

632
00:20:57,919 --> 00:21:00,559
that was very well received and it also

633
00:21:00,559 --> 00:21:02,640
made it realize that hey

634
00:21:02,640 --> 00:21:04,480
uh there is an appetite for security we

635
00:21:04,480 --> 00:21:06,480
had a massive turnout it's clearly

636
00:21:06,480 --> 00:21:07,919
people were worried about their kids

637
00:21:07,919 --> 00:21:10,480
going on the internet while they're away

638
00:21:10,480 --> 00:21:12,559
and they're also worried about malware

639
00:21:12,559 --> 00:21:13,840
that their kids might install on the

640
00:21:13,840 --> 00:21:15,440
laptops as well so

641
00:21:15,440 --> 00:21:16,960
from that perspective that was a great

642
00:21:16,960 --> 00:21:19,679
success but what that also meant is the

643
00:21:19,679 --> 00:21:21,360
whole organization got introduced to the

644
00:21:21,360 --> 00:21:22,720
security team

645
00:21:22,720 --> 00:21:26,240
now this is crucial because say unlike i

646
00:21:26,240 --> 00:21:28,320
don't know how many organizations

647
00:21:28,320 --> 00:21:30,320
outside of tech space have this but a

648
00:21:30,320 --> 00:21:31,679
lot of organization would have this

649
00:21:31,679 --> 00:21:34,720
place where there is usually a

650
00:21:34,720 --> 00:21:38,080
a town hall or all hands on deck kind of

651
00:21:38,080 --> 00:21:39,120
a meeting

652
00:21:39,120 --> 00:21:41,039
or there is like an in-person catch-up

653
00:21:41,039 --> 00:21:43,120
so you start day one today you walk

654
00:21:43,120 --> 00:21:45,120
around you say hello hey yamashish and

655
00:21:45,120 --> 00:21:46,880
then you see so would love to talk to

656
00:21:46,880 --> 00:21:48,880
you and you meet other tech leaders

657
00:21:48,880 --> 00:21:50,720
now that doesn't really happen in a

658
00:21:50,720 --> 00:21:53,039
remote world so how do you approach this

659
00:21:53,039 --> 00:21:54,720
that was our way we basically started

660
00:21:54,720 --> 00:21:57,280
running sessions for everyone which were

661
00:21:57,280 --> 00:21:59,039
not at all

662
00:21:59,039 --> 00:22:00,159
definitely cost related they were just

663
00:22:00,159 --> 00:22:03,039
security related what that did was it

664
00:22:03,039 --> 00:22:05,360
started opening up people's mind towards

665
00:22:05,360 --> 00:22:07,200
hey security is important where else can

666
00:22:07,200 --> 00:22:08,880
we do it so

667
00:22:08,880 --> 00:22:11,600
the the the best part that happened was

668
00:22:11,600 --> 00:22:14,080
we started getting requests more for

669
00:22:14,080 --> 00:22:15,760
people hey we are trying to do this i

670
00:22:15,760 --> 00:22:17,440
think the best example and such a simple

671
00:22:17,440 --> 00:22:18,559
case as well

672
00:22:18,559 --> 00:22:21,360
someone asked us a question around ssl

673
00:22:21,360 --> 00:22:24,159
they said hey we're trying to do tls 1.2

674
00:22:24,159 --> 00:22:25,919
but we're not really sure if we even

675
00:22:25,919 --> 00:22:27,919
need tls and what's that what what is

676
00:22:27,919 --> 00:22:30,559
this for now a lot of technical people

677
00:22:30,559 --> 00:22:31,919
listening to this going but it's not

678
00:22:31,919 --> 00:22:33,679
obvious you should use tls but you're

679
00:22:33,679 --> 00:22:35,120
going to have to put yourself in a in a

680
00:22:35,120 --> 00:22:37,360
developer's head for them it's literally

681
00:22:37,360 --> 00:22:38,720
just a configuration they just want to

682
00:22:38,720 --> 00:22:39,440
get

683
00:22:39,440 --> 00:22:41,520
get ahead that even that simplest thing

684
00:22:41,520 --> 00:22:44,480
of an ssl is simply just a requirement

685
00:22:44,480 --> 00:22:46,400
from security not really

686
00:22:46,400 --> 00:22:48,400
something that's a mandate so i took

687
00:22:48,400 --> 00:22:49,840
that as a win where people started

688
00:22:49,840 --> 00:22:52,000
reaching us reaching out to us for

689
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:53,200
questions now

690
00:22:53,200 --> 00:22:54,880
um so we're still trying to build a

691
00:22:54,880 --> 00:22:56,720
security champions program so how do you

692
00:22:56,720 --> 00:22:58,960
do this so we started doing

693
00:22:58,960 --> 00:23:01,039
team activity where we had captured the

694
00:23:01,039 --> 00:23:02,880
flag now there were for people who may

695
00:23:02,880 --> 00:23:04,320
have gone through the pandemic and

696
00:23:04,320 --> 00:23:05,679
probably still do

697
00:23:05,679 --> 00:23:07,600
have uh maybe working in an environment

698
00:23:07,600 --> 00:23:09,280
which are fully remote there are a lot

699
00:23:09,280 --> 00:23:10,640
of capture the flag events that happen

700
00:23:10,640 --> 00:23:11,840
on the internet

701
00:23:11,840 --> 00:23:13,440
which are free for anyone to join from

702
00:23:13,440 --> 00:23:15,760
anywhere in the world we started hosting

703
00:23:15,760 --> 00:23:18,240
team-based uh capture the flag where

704
00:23:18,240 --> 00:23:20,720
anyone in the company could join we were

705
00:23:20,720 --> 00:23:22,640
gonna help them out and we were going to

706
00:23:22,640 --> 00:23:25,200
participate as the company and win or no

707
00:23:25,200 --> 00:23:26,640
win doesn't really matter but all of us

708
00:23:26,640 --> 00:23:28,559
get to learn and i guess connect as

709
00:23:28,559 --> 00:23:30,559
friends we also started hanging out at

710
00:23:30,559 --> 00:23:32,320
their game days as well they had these

711
00:23:32,320 --> 00:23:35,440
awesome game day programs so it the the

712
00:23:35,440 --> 00:23:37,200
first step in this was

713
00:23:37,200 --> 00:23:38,640
how do you

714
00:23:38,640 --> 00:23:40,159
i guess get yourself recognized in the

715
00:23:40,159 --> 00:23:41,440
organization and this was one of the

716
00:23:41,440 --> 00:23:42,720
ways we did so

717
00:23:42,720 --> 00:23:44,480
i was surprised at how many security

718
00:23:44,480 --> 00:23:45,440
people

719
00:23:45,440 --> 00:23:48,240
uh where i i guess don't don't join in

720
00:23:48,240 --> 00:23:49,520
on any of the

721
00:23:49,520 --> 00:23:51,279
i guess online events that happen in the

722
00:23:51,279 --> 00:23:52,480
organization

723
00:23:52,480 --> 00:23:55,039
how many don't try and have organize i

724
00:23:55,039 --> 00:23:56,320
guess

725
00:23:56,320 --> 00:23:58,240
programs which invite other developers

726
00:23:58,240 --> 00:24:01,760
to come in and also have a look at hey

727
00:24:01,760 --> 00:24:03,200
this is how you could be doing security

728
00:24:03,200 --> 00:24:04,799
or hey let's participate in a

729
00:24:04,799 --> 00:24:06,799
non-security event show that the

730
00:24:06,799 --> 00:24:09,279
security team is also a fun team and not

731
00:24:09,279 --> 00:24:12,720
totally uh just up for always doing uh

732
00:24:12,720 --> 00:24:14,880
security work so that was one way that

733
00:24:14,880 --> 00:24:16,480
was the periodic team activity that we

734
00:24:16,480 --> 00:24:17,760
kind of go about

735
00:24:17,760 --> 00:24:20,000
now as it kind of matured i probably

736
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:22,159
would say six months had passed by then

737
00:24:22,159 --> 00:24:24,240
and we started to see people reach out

738
00:24:24,240 --> 00:24:25,679
to us for

739
00:24:25,679 --> 00:24:27,760
questions around cyber security or such

740
00:24:27,760 --> 00:24:29,840
things they had in their personal life

741
00:24:29,840 --> 00:24:32,480
how do i secure myself at home because

742
00:24:32,480 --> 00:24:35,279
hey there are no stop signs unlike our

743
00:24:35,279 --> 00:24:38,000
roads or tollways there are no stop

744
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:39,200
signs on the internet so how do we

745
00:24:39,200 --> 00:24:40,720
remain safe on the internet so that was

746
00:24:40,720 --> 00:24:43,039
really great for us

747
00:24:43,039 --> 00:24:44,799
now at that point what we started doing

748
00:24:44,799 --> 00:24:46,640
is we started introducing the concept of

749
00:24:46,640 --> 00:24:49,039
devsecops in terms of what it means what

750
00:24:49,039 --> 00:24:51,120
it's like what are we doing so some of

751
00:24:51,120 --> 00:24:54,640
the devsecops team members that i have

752
00:24:54,640 --> 00:24:57,840
they started making i guess little demos

753
00:24:57,840 --> 00:24:59,360
on what security could look like when

754
00:24:59,360 --> 00:25:00,799
it's automated

755
00:25:00,799 --> 00:25:03,200
and any question that was asked which

756
00:25:03,200 --> 00:25:04,880
was a great question in that in those

757
00:25:04,880 --> 00:25:06,559
sessions we started giving them uber

758
00:25:06,559 --> 00:25:09,200
swatches and this basically started

759
00:25:09,200 --> 00:25:10,640
building towards the fact that oh people

760
00:25:10,640 --> 00:25:12,400
wanted to ask more questions and we

761
00:25:12,400 --> 00:25:14,320
started running the we call it the hour

762
00:25:14,320 --> 00:25:16,799
of power where it's an hour long session

763
00:25:16,799 --> 00:25:18,159
uh it's not like a lunch and learn

764
00:25:18,159 --> 00:25:19,679
because i mean i guess there's no lunch

765
00:25:19,679 --> 00:25:21,600
and done when you're in person so

766
00:25:21,600 --> 00:25:23,039
we started running these sessions on

767
00:25:23,039 --> 00:25:25,440
friday evening or friday afternoon uh

768
00:25:25,440 --> 00:25:27,919
more like three o'clock four o'clock and

769
00:25:27,919 --> 00:25:30,000
that definitely helped quite a bit and

770
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:32,159
we started recognizing teams who were

771
00:25:32,159 --> 00:25:35,039
asking great questions we also had as an

772
00:25:35,039 --> 00:25:37,440
organization started moving towards

773
00:25:37,440 --> 00:25:39,840
one day dedicated in the month to reduce

774
00:25:39,840 --> 00:25:40,960
tech debt

775
00:25:40,960 --> 00:25:42,400
now that was really important from a

776
00:25:42,400 --> 00:25:43,679
security perspective because what that

777
00:25:43,679 --> 00:25:46,559
meant is we were able to go into

778
00:25:46,559 --> 00:25:48,000
a conversation and say hey what are you

779
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:50,400
doing for uh that dedicated day that's

780
00:25:50,400 --> 00:25:51,440
coming up

781
00:25:51,440 --> 00:25:53,039
can we help you with reduce the security

782
00:25:53,039 --> 00:25:55,120
problem that you've been facing and we

783
00:25:55,120 --> 00:25:56,640
started maintaining a leaderboard

784
00:25:56,640 --> 00:25:58,240
started giving recognition for people

785
00:25:58,240 --> 00:26:00,400
who were doing an awesome job and

786
00:26:00,400 --> 00:26:02,320
reaching out to people who needed help

787
00:26:02,320 --> 00:26:04,480
so that was something that we kind of

788
00:26:04,480 --> 00:26:05,840
kept working on and we're still working

789
00:26:05,840 --> 00:26:08,159
on but it reaches a certain level of

790
00:26:08,159 --> 00:26:09,200
maturity

791
00:26:09,200 --> 00:26:10,240
because how do you even measure

792
00:26:10,240 --> 00:26:11,440
something like this right i mean it's

793
00:26:11,440 --> 00:26:13,760
great to have programs where you have

794
00:26:13,760 --> 00:26:15,679
reached out to people you have others

795
00:26:15,679 --> 00:26:17,360
reaching out to you as well

796
00:26:17,360 --> 00:26:18,960
how do you even define

797
00:26:18,960 --> 00:26:21,679
what success looks like in a

798
00:26:21,679 --> 00:26:22,559
uh

799
00:26:22,559 --> 00:26:25,679
in hybrid world the way we managed

800
00:26:25,679 --> 00:26:27,039
success was

801
00:26:27,039 --> 00:26:29,520
the number of champions then that if we

802
00:26:29,520 --> 00:26:31,440
had more than one in a team which was

803
00:26:31,440 --> 00:26:32,799
good but i kind of would say it's an

804
00:26:32,799 --> 00:26:35,039
average metric but

805
00:26:35,039 --> 00:26:37,440
i would probably say the number of

806
00:26:37,440 --> 00:26:39,039
champions we had across team at least

807
00:26:39,039 --> 00:26:41,360
having one person in each team

808
00:26:41,360 --> 00:26:43,279
how we win it doesn't really matter but

809
00:26:43,279 --> 00:26:45,039
at least having one across a team was

810
00:26:45,039 --> 00:26:47,039
definitely important for us number of

811
00:26:47,039 --> 00:26:48,640
reach outs that we started getting which

812
00:26:48,640 --> 00:26:49,600
was

813
00:26:49,600 --> 00:26:51,840
definitely quite important the last one

814
00:26:51,840 --> 00:26:53,600
being recognition was transparency we

815
00:26:53,600 --> 00:26:56,240
started putting a leaderboard out for

816
00:26:56,240 --> 00:26:58,240
how many vulnerabilities that are there

817
00:26:58,240 --> 00:26:59,760
at the moment that are not addressed by

818
00:26:59,760 --> 00:27:02,320
a particular team and but not to kind of

819
00:27:02,320 --> 00:27:03,919
shame them but also

820
00:27:03,919 --> 00:27:06,080
to provide hey we are here to help we

821
00:27:06,080 --> 00:27:07,279
would love to

822
00:27:07,279 --> 00:27:09,520
help you kind of put this down and start

823
00:27:09,520 --> 00:27:11,120
rewarding people who are putting extra

824
00:27:11,120 --> 00:27:12,720
effort into reducing the number of

825
00:27:12,720 --> 00:27:14,400
vulnerabilities because i think i've

826
00:27:14,400 --> 00:27:16,080
been fortunate enough and i've had

827
00:27:16,080 --> 00:27:18,240
multiple conversations around this where

828
00:27:18,240 --> 00:27:20,480
a lot of people mentioned the fact that

829
00:27:20,480 --> 00:27:22,720
hey i don't think developers care about

830
00:27:22,720 --> 00:27:24,399
code but my experience has been very

831
00:27:24,399 --> 00:27:26,720
different developers love

832
00:27:26,720 --> 00:27:28,320
and are they love their code and are

833
00:27:28,320 --> 00:27:29,840
really proud about what they put out so

834
00:27:29,840 --> 00:27:31,440
if you kind of find anything which is

835
00:27:31,440 --> 00:27:33,440
probably wonderful they definitely keep

836
00:27:33,440 --> 00:27:35,840
keep an eye out for how do i

837
00:27:35,840 --> 00:27:37,039
get rid of this problem not to get

838
00:27:37,039 --> 00:27:38,640
ashish off my back or his team out of my

839
00:27:38,640 --> 00:27:40,399
back but because i want to put code out

840
00:27:40,399 --> 00:27:42,240
there which i'm proud of

841
00:27:42,240 --> 00:27:43,600
so that is definitely something that i

842
00:27:43,600 --> 00:27:45,279
find that was really helpful

843
00:27:45,279 --> 00:27:47,440
what i learned is unlike if you go and

844
00:27:47,440 --> 00:27:50,000
go back to my previous failure uh people

845
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:51,679
and process definitely helps

846
00:27:51,679 --> 00:27:54,559
uh education is the way to go forward

847
00:27:54,559 --> 00:27:56,880
pick the right tool so we ended up going

848
00:27:56,880 --> 00:27:59,679
for a software composition analysis so i

849
00:27:59,679 --> 00:28:02,080
guess an example is sneak we ended up

850
00:28:02,080 --> 00:28:04,399
going for that instead of having to go

851
00:28:04,399 --> 00:28:06,000
for something like a

852
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:07,679
sas tool which worked out really well so

853
00:28:07,679 --> 00:28:09,520
i was able to do produce code even

854
00:28:09,520 --> 00:28:12,000
faster that was kind of what my learning

855
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:13,600
and that was kind of what i wanted to

856
00:28:13,600 --> 00:28:14,960
share over here if you people have

857
00:28:14,960 --> 00:28:16,480

867
00:28:36,480 --> 00:28:37,840
don't know about other questions but the

868
00:28:37,840 --> 00:28:39,520
questions that everyone definitely wants

869
00:28:39,520 --> 00:28:41,600
to see simba

870
00:28:41,600 --> 00:28:42,559
um

871
00:28:42,559 --> 00:28:45,039
sharing with

872
00:28:56,799 --> 00:28:58,480
and yes that's the dog whose name is

873
00:28:58,480 --> 00:29:00,720
simba his job is done for the days we do

874
00:29:00,720 --> 00:29:03,039
have one quick question um so this is

875
00:29:03,039 --> 00:29:05,039
coming from gerald

876
00:29:05,039 --> 00:29:06,799
based on your experience if you had to

877
00:29:06,799 --> 00:29:08,480
name three top reasons why your

878
00:29:08,480 --> 00:29:10,399
management wouldn't want to prioritize

879
00:29:10,399 --> 00:29:12,559
security what would they be

880
00:29:12,559 --> 00:29:14,480
um if you can't cover all three maybe

881
00:29:14,480 --> 00:29:16,240
just one or two

882
00:29:16,240 --> 00:29:17,600
yeah that's fine i think i can announce

883
00:29:17,600 --> 00:29:19,120
that i probably said the top one that

884
00:29:19,120 --> 00:29:20,480
comes to mind

885
00:29:20,480 --> 00:29:22,399
is the fact that in general

886
00:29:22,399 --> 00:29:25,440
if security hasn't done a great job of

887
00:29:25,440 --> 00:29:28,559
explaining the risk behind so let me

888
00:29:28,559 --> 00:29:29,679
take a step back and talk about this

889
00:29:29,679 --> 00:29:31,760
from a business perspective i think from

890
00:29:31,760 --> 00:29:33,200
a business perspective

891
00:29:33,200 --> 00:29:35,120
they want to release products they want

892
00:29:35,120 --> 00:29:37,200
to be out and i guess out on the

893
00:29:37,200 --> 00:29:39,039
internet or wherever they release

894
00:29:39,039 --> 00:29:40,880
products out they want to be there

895
00:29:40,880 --> 00:29:42,480
releasing products

896
00:29:42,480 --> 00:29:44,640
beating their competition doing getting

897
00:29:44,640 --> 00:29:46,880
more customers now if you are able to

898
00:29:46,880 --> 00:29:48,080
identify

899
00:29:48,080 --> 00:29:50,080
places where say for example don't focus

900
00:29:50,080 --> 00:29:51,600
on the uh

901
00:29:51,600 --> 00:29:53,440
don't focus on things which are say

902
00:29:53,440 --> 00:29:55,679
obvious for example if you you don't

903
00:29:55,679 --> 00:29:56,640
want to

904
00:29:56,640 --> 00:29:58,720
i guess the analogy that i use you don't

905
00:29:58,720 --> 00:30:00,240
want to eat an elephant in one go you

906
00:30:00,240 --> 00:30:02,480
want to eat it one bite at a time so if

907
00:30:02,480 --> 00:30:04,080
you focus on which is what which is what

908
00:30:04,080 --> 00:30:04,960
we did

909
00:30:04,960 --> 00:30:06,320
when we were having conversation with

910
00:30:06,320 --> 00:30:08,799
the board and the business we focused on

911
00:30:08,799 --> 00:30:10,320
some of the crown jewels in the

912
00:30:10,320 --> 00:30:13,120
organization which were things like hey

913
00:30:13,120 --> 00:30:14,880
uh what is the most important thing for

914
00:30:14,880 --> 00:30:16,559
us in the organization if that was to be

915
00:30:16,559 --> 00:30:17,679
compromised

916
00:30:17,679 --> 00:30:18,640
would we

917
00:30:18,640 --> 00:30:20,320
not have a business

918
00:30:20,320 --> 00:30:21,919
we started our def psychos program over

919
00:30:21,919 --> 00:30:23,520
there because it was the easiest to

920
00:30:23,520 --> 00:30:26,240
explain how we can manage uh i guess or

921
00:30:26,240 --> 00:30:28,559
ongoingly what we're doing in terms of

922
00:30:28,559 --> 00:30:31,440
the work we do and how can we also

923
00:30:31,440 --> 00:30:33,039
manage to show

924
00:30:33,039 --> 00:30:33,840
hey

925
00:30:33,840 --> 00:30:35,360
this is this is really important now

926
00:30:35,360 --> 00:30:37,200
that was the first one the second one

927
00:30:37,200 --> 00:30:40,640
being uh some leaders just do not

928
00:30:40,640 --> 00:30:44,159
want security is considered good to have

929
00:30:44,159 --> 00:30:46,159
now that's not a bad thing and i think

930
00:30:46,159 --> 00:30:48,320
i've spoken to a few people uh they also

931
00:30:48,320 --> 00:30:50,480
talk about the fact that security should

932
00:30:50,480 --> 00:30:52,240
not be the number one problem unless

933
00:30:52,240 --> 00:30:54,080
you're in a cyber security organization

934
00:30:54,080 --> 00:30:55,279
because if you think about if you're if

935
00:30:55,279 --> 00:30:56,799
you're into the business of releasing

936
00:30:56,799 --> 00:30:58,960
app stores into apple security is not

937
00:30:58,960 --> 00:31:01,120
number one it's probably number five

938
00:31:01,120 --> 00:31:02,880
number six because you want to be able

939
00:31:02,880 --> 00:31:04,880
to go out to the market so hopefully

940
00:31:04,880 --> 00:31:06,320
there were probably the two that come to

941
00:31:06,320 --> 00:31:07,519
mind maybe i don't have a third one in

942
00:31:07,519 --> 00:31:09,840
mind but those two yeah i think two will

943
00:31:09,840 --> 00:31:11,600
take two but obviously you know we can

944
00:31:11,600 --> 00:31:13,600
share three later um but thanks for the

945
00:31:13,600 --> 00:31:15,600
question as well gerald and thank you so

946
00:31:15,600 --> 00:31:18,159
much for um that talk and showing us

947
00:31:18,159 --> 00:31:20,960
simba as well um thanks so much for that

948
00:31:20,960 --> 00:31:22,559
ashish

949
00:31:22,559 --> 00:31:23,760
thank you

950
