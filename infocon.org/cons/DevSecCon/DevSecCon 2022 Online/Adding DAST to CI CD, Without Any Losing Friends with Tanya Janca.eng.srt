in oh yes we can see that we just need a

21
00:00:47,840 --> 00:00:50,320
small help so you can see that uh you're

22
00:00:50,320 --> 00:00:51,760
sharing the screen if you can just bring

23
00:00:51,760 --> 00:00:53,280
it a little down

24
00:00:53,280 --> 00:00:55,680
um i think that'll be perfect

25
00:00:55,680 --> 00:00:57,600
ready me down

26
00:00:57,600 --> 00:00:58,640
oh

27
00:00:58,640 --> 00:01:00,559
at the bottom you see the stop sharing

28
00:01:00,559 --> 00:01:03,199
option if you can just bring it

29
00:01:03,199 --> 00:01:06,080
yes oh wait a minute okay and then start

30
00:01:06,080 --> 00:01:07,600
sharing again

31
00:01:07,600 --> 00:01:09,200
the seconds

32
00:01:09,200 --> 00:01:11,280
no problem okay

33
00:01:11,280 --> 00:01:13,840
so share

34
00:01:13,840 --> 00:01:15,119
i'm going to share my whole screen does

35
00:01:15,119 --> 00:01:16,960
that sound okay

36
00:01:16,960 --> 00:01:20,400
yes that sounds fine i share

37
00:01:20,400 --> 00:01:22,960
uh so i'm going to share and then i'm

38
00:01:22,960 --> 00:01:25,600
going to make it a full screen

39
00:01:25,600 --> 00:01:28,400
yes so if i do full screen how does that

40
00:01:28,400 --> 00:01:29,920
look

41
00:01:29,920 --> 00:01:31,920
oh that's perfect

42
00:01:31,920 --> 00:01:34,320
okay so hopefully my doc will disappear

43
00:01:34,320 --> 00:01:35,520
in a second

44
00:01:35,520 --> 00:01:36,479
okay

45
00:01:36,479 --> 00:01:38,000
so how about this

46
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:40,479
is that okay

47
00:01:40,720 --> 00:01:41,840

48
00:01:41,840 --> 00:01:42,960
thank you

49
00:01:42,960 --> 00:01:45,040
okay we're looking forward to it we just

50
00:01:45,040 --> 00:01:47,280
go off the screen now the stage is all

51
00:01:47,280 --> 00:01:48,479
yours

52
00:01:48,479 --> 00:01:52,479
okay thank you thanks anya

53
00:01:53,280 --> 00:01:55,360
hi everyone i'm tanya jacob

54
00:01:55,360 --> 00:01:58,000
and i am really excited to talk to you

55
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:01,360
about how to add das to a ci cd pipeline

56
00:02:01,360 --> 00:02:03,040
so das means

57
00:02:03,040 --> 00:02:05,040
dynamic application security testing

58
00:02:05,040 --> 00:02:06,799
which is one of the types of ways you

59
00:02:06,799 --> 00:02:08,959
can look at an application

60
00:02:08,959 --> 00:02:12,319
to test it for security problems and

61
00:02:12,319 --> 00:02:15,200
i wanted to talk about this because i do

62
00:02:15,200 --> 00:02:16,879
a fair amount of consulting and i'm

63
00:02:16,879 --> 00:02:18,640
often hearing from clients like oh we

64
00:02:18,640 --> 00:02:20,959
bought this cool tool and we put into

65
00:02:20,959 --> 00:02:23,040
our pipeline and we turned it on like a

66
00:02:23,040 --> 00:02:24,879
crazy fire hose

67
00:02:24,879 --> 00:02:25,760
and

68
00:02:25,760 --> 00:02:28,160
the pipeline then ran like 18 hours

69
00:02:28,160 --> 00:02:30,640
instead of 18 minutes or we turned it on

70
00:02:30,640 --> 00:02:32,959
and found 5000 vulnerabilities and

71
00:02:32,959 --> 00:02:34,319
basically the devs don't want to hang

72
00:02:34,319 --> 00:02:36,400
out with us anymore or they locked us

73
00:02:36,400 --> 00:02:39,040
out of the cicd pipeline or sort of

74
00:02:39,040 --> 00:02:41,040
something like this i added that's the

75
00:02:41,040 --> 00:02:42,800
cicd pipeline

76
00:02:42,800 --> 00:02:45,040
it's too slow

77
00:02:45,040 --> 00:02:46,640
hopefully there's no violence involved

78
00:02:46,640 --> 00:02:49,040
but so i decided that i would change the

79
00:02:49,040 --> 00:02:51,360
name of this talk to adding desk to ci

80
00:02:51,360 --> 00:02:54,720
cd without losing any friends

81
00:02:54,720 --> 00:02:56,640
um and i feel like

82
00:02:56,640 --> 00:02:58,640
if you're at this conference

83
00:02:58,640 --> 00:03:00,560
and if you're a person that has done

84
00:03:00,560 --> 00:03:02,800
devops and worked in devops environments

85
00:03:02,800 --> 00:03:05,840
you know that relationships within

86
00:03:05,840 --> 00:03:09,200
devops is part of how it works so before

87
00:03:09,200 --> 00:03:10,800
you know we would toss things over the

88
00:03:10,800 --> 00:03:12,560
wall and i'd be like a software

89
00:03:12,560 --> 00:03:14,319
developer i'd be like ha ha

90
00:03:14,319 --> 00:03:17,040
tough luck ops that's your problem now

91
00:03:17,040 --> 00:03:19,280
with devops it's everyone's problem we

92
00:03:19,280 --> 00:03:20,800
have to work together and make things

93
00:03:20,800 --> 00:03:23,360
work and if you're a security person and

94
00:03:23,360 --> 00:03:25,280
you have terrible relationships with the

95
00:03:25,280 --> 00:03:27,280
devops team or whether you want to call

96
00:03:27,280 --> 00:03:29,120
them the developers and the operations

97
00:03:29,120 --> 00:03:31,840
folks or the sres or whatever you call

98
00:03:31,840 --> 00:03:33,920
your colleagues to help make sure our

99
00:03:33,920 --> 00:03:36,239
software is out there and it's solid and

100
00:03:36,239 --> 00:03:37,760
stable

101
00:03:37,760 --> 00:03:39,280
if you have better relationships with

102
00:03:39,280 --> 00:03:41,040
them you're not going to be good at

103
00:03:41,040 --> 00:03:43,040
getting your job done

104
00:03:43,040 --> 00:03:44,239
and i have

105
00:03:44,239 --> 00:03:47,120
had the most luck when i have great

106
00:03:47,120 --> 00:03:49,599
relationships and contacts and trust

107
00:03:49,599 --> 00:03:51,920
with the other teams so i say without

108
00:03:51,920 --> 00:03:54,159
losing any friends because i'm making a

109
00:03:54,159 --> 00:03:57,280
joke but really truly it's like without

110
00:03:57,280 --> 00:03:59,280
destroying all the trust you work so

111
00:03:59,280 --> 00:04:00,720
hard to build

112
00:04:00,720 --> 00:04:02,560
okay so who am i so i'm tanya i'm a

113
00:04:02,560 --> 00:04:04,239
giant nerd i am

114
00:04:04,239 --> 00:04:06,400
i am director of developer relations and

115
00:04:06,400 --> 00:04:08,159
community at bright

116
00:04:08,159 --> 00:04:10,239
and honestly when i wrote my own job

117
00:04:10,239 --> 00:04:11,920
description i was like wow i can't

118
00:04:11,920 --> 00:04:14,239
believe i get to have this job i

119
00:04:14,239 --> 00:04:16,238
basically get to speak at conferences

120
00:04:16,238 --> 00:04:18,478
and run the lehigh careful community and

121
00:04:18,478 --> 00:04:21,839
just help them make the dash rewrite way

122
00:04:21,839 --> 00:04:23,919
better and better and work with people

123
00:04:23,919 --> 00:04:25,919
who i like so life's really good right

124
00:04:25,919 --> 00:04:26,880
now

125
00:04:26,880 --> 00:04:28,240
i'm the founder of the we have purple

126
00:04:28,240 --> 00:04:30,400
community i'm known as shiax purple i

127
00:04:30,400 --> 00:04:32,720
wrote a book called bob alice and bob

128
00:04:32,720 --> 00:04:35,120
learn application security not just bob

129
00:04:35,120 --> 00:04:37,360
um i'm an advisor i've been in tech a

130
00:04:37,360 --> 00:04:39,759
long time but the main point of this

131
00:04:39,759 --> 00:04:41,680
slide is i am a nerd on the internet

132
00:04:41,680 --> 00:04:43,759
who's very excited about security if you

133
00:04:43,759 --> 00:04:45,759
just take one thing away and i have

134
00:04:45,759 --> 00:04:48,320
great hair okay so what problem are we

135
00:04:48,320 --> 00:04:50,000
solving

136
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:51,520
so if you're attending a conference like

137
00:04:51,520 --> 00:04:54,400
this a security focus conference whether

138
00:04:54,400 --> 00:04:55,759
you're a software developer an

139
00:04:55,759 --> 00:04:57,600
operations person a person who loves

140
00:04:57,600 --> 00:05:00,320
automation a qa engineer

141
00:05:00,320 --> 00:05:01,120
you

142
00:05:01,120 --> 00:05:04,400
care about the quality of the software

143
00:05:04,400 --> 00:05:05,680
you care

144
00:05:05,680 --> 00:05:08,000
the data that of your organization is

145
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:09,759
protected and safe you care about

146
00:05:09,759 --> 00:05:11,680
protecting your customers and your

147
00:05:11,680 --> 00:05:13,120
colleagues and if you work in the

148
00:05:13,120 --> 00:05:14,960
government your citizens

149
00:05:14,960 --> 00:05:15,919
and

150
00:05:15,919 --> 00:05:17,840
insecure software is causing data

151
00:05:17,840 --> 00:05:19,680
breaches all around the world is the

152
00:05:19,680 --> 00:05:21,840
number one cause of data breaches

153
00:05:21,840 --> 00:05:23,199
unfortunately

154
00:05:23,199 --> 00:05:25,199
and it has been for many years according

155
00:05:25,199 --> 00:05:27,520
to the verizon breach report

156
00:05:27,520 --> 00:05:29,840
and so this is one of the problems we

157
00:05:29,840 --> 00:05:31,199
want to solve

158
00:05:31,199 --> 00:05:33,919
another problem is we want or another

159
00:05:33,919 --> 00:05:35,520
part of this problem is meeting the

160
00:05:35,520 --> 00:05:37,520
requirements of devops so if we're going

161
00:05:37,520 --> 00:05:39,039
to work with devops folks they have

162
00:05:39,039 --> 00:05:41,919
requirements so they require accuracy if

163
00:05:41,919 --> 00:05:42,960
you're going to put something in a

164
00:05:42,960 --> 00:05:44,240
pipeline you can't just be shooting

165
00:05:44,240 --> 00:05:46,160
false positives everywhere

166
00:05:46,160 --> 00:05:49,120
speed things need to move fast you can't

167
00:05:49,120 --> 00:05:50,960
put a scanner in and have it run six

168
00:05:50,960 --> 00:05:53,840
hours or eight hours or whatever they

169
00:05:53,840 --> 00:05:55,440
talk about minutes they don't talk about

170
00:05:55,440 --> 00:05:56,880
hours and they certainly don't talk

171
00:05:56,880 --> 00:05:58,720
about days

172
00:05:58,720 --> 00:06:00,960
and automation we don't have time to do

173
00:06:00,960 --> 00:06:03,840
everything manually anymore and that is

174
00:06:03,840 --> 00:06:05,759
the beauty of a ci cd pipeline if you're

175
00:06:05,759 --> 00:06:07,520
a nerd like me the first time you saw

176
00:06:07,520 --> 00:06:10,319
pipeline software you're probably like

177
00:06:10,319 --> 00:06:13,479
i was pretty excited okay so more

178
00:06:13,479 --> 00:06:16,240
devsecops has requirements as well so if

179
00:06:16,240 --> 00:06:18,479
you want to weave security through

180
00:06:18,479 --> 00:06:21,680
devops there are things that you must do

181
00:06:21,680 --> 00:06:23,600
so we need to test for multiple angles

182
00:06:23,600 --> 00:06:25,360
so today i'm going to talk about dynamic

183
00:06:25,360 --> 00:06:27,919
scanning and that is the place where i

184
00:06:27,919 --> 00:06:30,400
start and i'll explain why later but

185
00:06:30,400 --> 00:06:33,120
there's so many different angles like

186
00:06:33,120 --> 00:06:34,880
there's software composition analysis

187
00:06:34,880 --> 00:06:36,960
there's static analysis there's making

188
00:06:36,960 --> 00:06:39,120
sure that the

189
00:06:39,120 --> 00:06:40,720
um like the infrastructure that's

190
00:06:40,720 --> 00:06:43,120
sitting upon is safe that the cloud

191
00:06:43,120 --> 00:06:45,680
everything around it is safe and so

192
00:06:45,680 --> 00:06:47,600
there's lots of different ways to test

193
00:06:47,600 --> 00:06:49,759
this is one of them

194
00:06:49,759 --> 00:06:51,360
we need to have good relationships like

195
00:06:51,360 --> 00:06:53,120
i said before if you are a security

196
00:06:53,120 --> 00:06:54,000
person

197
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:57,280
if all the software developers fear you

198
00:06:57,280 --> 00:06:59,120
like as much as you might

199
00:06:59,120 --> 00:07:00,800
think that that's good because you think

200
00:07:00,800 --> 00:07:02,960
they might be it's not good trust me it

201
00:07:02,960 --> 00:07:05,039
really isn't um

202
00:07:05,039 --> 00:07:06,720
i i have done that before where i've

203
00:07:06,720 --> 00:07:08,479
accidentally scared people because i was

204
00:07:08,479 --> 00:07:10,880
a bit like freaking out on them about

205
00:07:10,880 --> 00:07:12,400
things and

206
00:07:12,400 --> 00:07:13,199
you know

207
00:07:13,199 --> 00:07:15,039
being really concerned but not wording

208
00:07:15,039 --> 00:07:16,400
it in a good way that was clear or

209
00:07:16,400 --> 00:07:19,120
obvious what i wanted and it was way

210
00:07:19,120 --> 00:07:21,759
worse than when i came in peace my

211
00:07:21,759 --> 00:07:23,199
friend nikki becker she's like yeah

212
00:07:23,199 --> 00:07:24,800
whenever i meet new devs i'm like i'm

213
00:07:24,800 --> 00:07:27,039
from security and i come in peace and i

214
00:07:27,039 --> 00:07:29,520
think that's like such the best way to

215
00:07:29,520 --> 00:07:30,960
describe it

216
00:07:30,960 --> 00:07:33,120
and the other thing is that

217
00:07:33,120 --> 00:07:34,639
maybe this isn't a requirement maybe

218
00:07:34,639 --> 00:07:37,599
this is like a goal of devsecops is i

219
00:07:37,599 --> 00:07:39,919
want to fix bugs as soon as humanly

220
00:07:39,919 --> 00:07:41,440
possible in the system development

221
00:07:41,440 --> 00:07:43,039
lifecycle like if i can write

222
00:07:43,039 --> 00:07:44,639
requirements that helps you avoid the

223
00:07:44,639 --> 00:07:46,720
bug in the first place if i can threat

224
00:07:46,720 --> 00:07:48,639
mobile with you in the design phase

225
00:07:48,639 --> 00:07:50,720
that's awesome but once you start

226
00:07:50,720 --> 00:07:52,400
writing code and you start actually

227
00:07:52,400 --> 00:07:54,960
building things i can do all sorts of

228
00:07:54,960 --> 00:07:56,479
testing for you

229
00:07:56,479 --> 00:07:58,400
but it only matters if you take that

230
00:07:58,400 --> 00:08:00,879
feedback and do something with it so

231
00:08:00,879 --> 00:08:03,599
let's start what is that

232
00:08:03,599 --> 00:08:05,360
okay so it stands for dynamic

233
00:08:05,360 --> 00:08:06,879
application security testing but what

234
00:08:06,879 --> 00:08:08,879
does it really mean it means that you

235
00:08:08,879 --> 00:08:11,120
have a web app or part of a web app or

236
00:08:11,120 --> 00:08:13,520
an api but something that is running and

237
00:08:13,520 --> 00:08:15,199
it's functioning and that's why it's

238
00:08:15,199 --> 00:08:17,360
called dynamic because it moves

239
00:08:17,360 --> 00:08:19,120
and your tool

240
00:08:19,120 --> 00:08:21,280
interacts with it

241
00:08:21,280 --> 00:08:23,680
and tests it from the outside so it

242
00:08:23,680 --> 00:08:25,440
sends requests it reads the responses

243
00:08:25,440 --> 00:08:27,840
and says hmm let me try again and it

244
00:08:27,840 --> 00:08:29,599
goes back and forth and it tries to find

245
00:08:29,599 --> 00:08:32,479
every possible vulnerability that it can

246
00:08:32,479 --> 00:08:34,559
das is one of the oldest application

247
00:08:34,559 --> 00:08:38,399
security tools and it's wildly popular

248
00:08:38,399 --> 00:08:39,440
because

249
00:08:39,440 --> 00:08:41,519
well let's talk about

250
00:08:41,519 --> 00:08:44,399
why das okay so i have three reasons why

251
00:08:44,399 --> 00:08:46,640
that so when i was a dev or a software

252
00:08:46,640 --> 00:08:47,920
developer

253
00:08:47,920 --> 00:08:48,959
um

254
00:08:48,959 --> 00:08:50,800
i met an ethical hacker he was really

255
00:08:50,800 --> 00:08:52,640
cool he was in a band eyes in a band

256
00:08:52,640 --> 00:08:54,880
obviously our bands had to play together

257
00:08:54,880 --> 00:08:57,519
um but he showed me how to run a dynamic

258
00:08:57,519 --> 00:08:59,440
scanner and i felt

259
00:08:59,440 --> 00:09:00,720
powerful

260
00:09:00,720 --> 00:09:02,399
i found all these vulnerabilities in

261
00:09:02,399 --> 00:09:04,160
just a few minutes and i was like oh my

262
00:09:04,160 --> 00:09:07,760
gosh and he showed me like you can like

263
00:09:07,760 --> 00:09:10,959
it's not legal to do so but you are able

264
00:09:10,959 --> 00:09:12,160
to point it on

265
00:09:12,160 --> 00:09:14,160
at any website on the internet and if

266
00:09:14,160 --> 00:09:16,160
you have a website on the internet that

267
00:09:16,160 --> 00:09:18,320
is even remotely possible someone has

268
00:09:18,320 --> 00:09:20,640
probably run a desk against it is that

269
00:09:20,640 --> 00:09:23,600
legal no do people care they're on the

270
00:09:23,600 --> 00:09:26,640
internet that are malicious i don't know

271
00:09:26,640 --> 00:09:28,720
i don't break the law i'm not a fan

272
00:09:28,720 --> 00:09:30,160
except for when i make poor parking

273
00:09:30,160 --> 00:09:32,560
decisions but the point of this is that

274
00:09:32,560 --> 00:09:35,120
any can point you at your app

275
00:09:35,120 --> 00:09:37,600
if you are an open source project they

276
00:09:37,600 --> 00:09:39,440
can also scan your code they can do

277
00:09:39,440 --> 00:09:41,040
software composition analysis they can

278
00:09:41,040 --> 00:09:42,959
do static analysis if you have

279
00:09:42,959 --> 00:09:44,399
infrastructures code they can analyze

280
00:09:44,399 --> 00:09:46,080
your infrastructure

281
00:09:46,080 --> 00:09:48,000
but if you have closed proprietary

282
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:49,200
source

283
00:09:49,200 --> 00:09:51,440
that you're not sharing the only look

284
00:09:51,440 --> 00:09:52,720
they get at it

285
00:09:52,720 --> 00:09:54,560
is with dynamic scanning

286
00:09:54,560 --> 00:09:56,480
and so i want to fix those things first

287
00:09:56,480 --> 00:09:58,480
because it's really easy to run

288
00:09:58,480 --> 00:09:59,440
it's easy to find lots of

289
00:09:59,440 --> 00:10:03,040
vulnerabilities it's pretty darn fast

290
00:10:03,040 --> 00:10:04,800
you don't have to be that smart to do it

291
00:10:04,800 --> 00:10:06,079
i i

292
00:10:06,079 --> 00:10:07,600
used to run workshops and i'd show

293
00:10:07,600 --> 00:10:09,680
people and in half an hour i'd have lots

294
00:10:09,680 --> 00:10:12,079
of 18 year olds scanning and hacking old

295
00:10:12,079 --> 00:10:12,959
things

296
00:10:12,959 --> 00:10:15,040
it's really easy and because anyone can

297
00:10:15,040 --> 00:10:17,040
do it and your web your app is just

298
00:10:17,040 --> 00:10:19,040
sitting there on the web anyone can scan

299
00:10:19,040 --> 00:10:21,920
it i feel i need to start with that

300
00:10:21,920 --> 00:10:24,079
so that's why i asked

301
00:10:24,079 --> 00:10:26,720
so what is devops so this is going to be

302
00:10:26,720 --> 00:10:28,000
really short because if you're at

303
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:29,600
devsecond i kind of hope that you're

304
00:10:29,600 --> 00:10:31,519
like i know what devops is tanya why are

305
00:10:31,519 --> 00:10:33,279
you doing this i'm doing this for the

306
00:10:33,279 --> 00:10:35,440
people who are brand new i want to

307
00:10:35,440 --> 00:10:37,839
welcome into our industry so please

308
00:10:37,839 --> 00:10:40,000
give me one moment for them

309
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:43,040
devops is a way to make software that is

310
00:10:43,040 --> 00:10:44,480
more modern

311
00:10:44,480 --> 00:10:46,800
than the older ways like waterfall and

312
00:10:46,800 --> 00:10:48,480
there was agile and then there was

313
00:10:48,480 --> 00:10:50,079
devops there are other things in the

314
00:10:50,079 --> 00:10:52,079
middle or whatever but devops is

315
00:10:52,079 --> 00:10:54,240
extraordinarily popular because it is

316
00:10:54,240 --> 00:10:56,959
fast efficient and i'm just gonna say it

317
00:10:56,959 --> 00:11:00,399
it's super fun it is way more fun than

318
00:11:00,399 --> 00:11:02,800
waterfall i joke and call it water

319
00:11:02,800 --> 00:11:05,040
failed but the point of the story is is

320
00:11:05,040 --> 00:11:07,120
devops is a more modern way to make

321
00:11:07,120 --> 00:11:09,600
software and it is not paying one person

322
00:11:09,600 --> 00:11:11,839
to do two jobs that's not what it is one

323
00:11:11,839 --> 00:11:13,440
of my cousins was like

324
00:11:13,440 --> 00:11:15,360
my boss wants me to do two jobs and he

325
00:11:15,360 --> 00:11:17,200
said that makes me devops i'm like no

326
00:11:17,200 --> 00:11:19,839
that makes him a bad boss but i digress

327
00:11:19,839 --> 00:11:22,320
okay so briefly again just tiny bit more

328
00:11:22,320 --> 00:11:26,160
review so cicd means pipeline software

329
00:11:26,160 --> 00:11:29,360
it automates testing and release of

330
00:11:29,360 --> 00:11:30,640
software and if you're doing

331
00:11:30,640 --> 00:11:33,040
infrastructure infrastructure is code so

332
00:11:33,040 --> 00:11:33,760
it

333
00:11:33,760 --> 00:11:36,160
automatically builds your app

334
00:11:36,160 --> 00:11:38,399
and then it puts it let's say into a dev

335
00:11:38,399 --> 00:11:40,800
environment and it releases it to qa all

336
00:11:40,800 --> 00:11:42,800
these other places and along the way it

337
00:11:42,800 --> 00:11:45,120
tests and you can automate it to just do

338
00:11:45,120 --> 00:11:47,120
all of that without you if it passes you

339
00:11:47,120 --> 00:11:49,519
can make there be manual review reviews

340
00:11:49,519 --> 00:11:51,839
and approvals it's totally up to you

341
00:11:51,839 --> 00:11:54,079
but that's magical i used to have to do

342
00:11:54,079 --> 00:11:57,360
all that crap manually and it sucked

343
00:11:57,360 --> 00:11:59,920
devops requires just to review

344
00:11:59,920 --> 00:12:01,760
these are the three ways of devops

345
00:12:01,760 --> 00:12:04,880
efficiency of the entire system so tanya

346
00:12:04,880 --> 00:12:06,959
not just your part no tossing things

347
00:12:06,959 --> 00:12:08,639
over to ops and being like that's your

348
00:12:08,639 --> 00:12:10,399
problem

349
00:12:10,399 --> 00:12:12,720
fast feedback and the feedback needs to

350
00:12:12,720 --> 00:12:15,360
be accurate and it needs to get to the

351
00:12:15,360 --> 00:12:17,120
right person a whole bunch of feedback

352
00:12:17,120 --> 00:12:19,120
that goes to some system over there that

353
00:12:19,120 --> 00:12:21,839
no one's looking at that's not valuable

354
00:12:21,839 --> 00:12:24,000
and continuous learning and improvement

355
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:25,519
this is the third way of devops and

356
00:12:25,519 --> 00:12:27,519
that's what you're doing right now by

357
00:12:27,519 --> 00:12:29,600
attending this conference

358
00:12:29,600 --> 00:12:31,920
lastly not all security testing needs to

359
00:12:31,920 --> 00:12:33,680
be in a pipeline and we're going to talk

360
00:12:33,680 --> 00:12:35,600
about that just for a bit but mostly

361
00:12:35,600 --> 00:12:37,360
we're going to talk about how to be cool

362
00:12:37,360 --> 00:12:39,040
and run a desk in your pipeline without

363
00:12:39,040 --> 00:12:41,200
taking off all the other teams

364
00:12:41,200 --> 00:12:43,440
so let's talk strategy for putting a

365
00:12:43,440 --> 00:12:44,959
dynamic scammer

366
00:12:44,959 --> 00:12:47,440
in your cic pipeline

367
00:12:47,440 --> 00:12:48,480
yes

368
00:12:48,480 --> 00:12:51,519
high fives um so the first strategy that

369
00:12:51,519 --> 00:12:52,720
i see

370
00:12:52,720 --> 00:12:55,040
is running your desk on full blast and

371
00:12:55,040 --> 00:12:57,360
that is where you lose your friends so i

372
00:12:57,360 --> 00:12:59,200
did that

373
00:12:59,200 --> 00:13:00,480
when i first

374
00:13:00,480 --> 00:13:02,320
did the dev swap project and i was

375
00:13:02,320 --> 00:13:04,639
making a pipeline i was really excited

376
00:13:04,639 --> 00:13:08,000
and i ran a desk that is a good fun tool

377
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:10,320
and it ran forever

378
00:13:10,320 --> 00:13:12,880
and the other devs were like why did it

379
00:13:12,880 --> 00:13:15,120
take so long

380
00:13:15,120 --> 00:13:16,959
and that's what i was doing and our app

381
00:13:16,959 --> 00:13:19,440
did almost nothing and it still took

382
00:13:19,440 --> 00:13:20,399
quite a while

383
00:13:20,399 --> 00:13:22,160
and so i had to figure out how to do it

384
00:13:22,160 --> 00:13:24,079
faster so that no one turned it off

385
00:13:24,079 --> 00:13:26,320
because that's what devs do i know i am

386
00:13:26,320 --> 00:13:28,320
one i turn things off behind your back

387
00:13:28,320 --> 00:13:31,120
they're making my job difficult

388
00:13:31,120 --> 00:13:32,480
okay so the next thing you can do is you

389
00:13:32,480 --> 00:13:34,480
can refine your scope so i started to

390
00:13:34,480 --> 00:13:35,839
figure out

391
00:13:35,839 --> 00:13:38,000
if i worked at a place with really smart

392
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:40,320
qa people who were

393
00:13:40,320 --> 00:13:42,560
recording their tests

394
00:13:42,560 --> 00:13:45,600
um i think it's selenium that they use

395
00:13:45,600 --> 00:13:47,760
where basically they record a har file

396
00:13:47,760 --> 00:13:50,800
so that's an html archive file or dot

397
00:13:50,800 --> 00:13:52,240
h-a-r

398
00:13:52,240 --> 00:13:55,040
so they were record testing part of it i

399
00:13:55,040 --> 00:13:57,519
could take that shove that into my desk

400
00:13:57,519 --> 00:13:59,279
and then it's like turning it into a

401
00:13:59,279 --> 00:14:01,600
scalpel and i would just test that one

402
00:14:01,600 --> 00:14:02,720
part

403
00:14:02,720 --> 00:14:04,880
and it would be laser focused it'd be 20

404
00:14:04,880 --> 00:14:07,760
of the time it'd be way faster and so as

405
00:14:07,760 --> 00:14:09,680
my team is releasing new stuff i'm like

406
00:14:09,680 --> 00:14:10,720
cool

407
00:14:10,720 --> 00:14:12,720
qa person are you ready for that new

408
00:14:12,720 --> 00:14:15,519
feature i so am i now

409
00:14:15,519 --> 00:14:17,120
and then i'd feed it in there and they

410
00:14:17,120 --> 00:14:19,279
would take care of the hair files for me

411
00:14:19,279 --> 00:14:21,279
and i have to say this only works if you

412
00:14:21,279 --> 00:14:23,360
have help if you are one abstech person

413
00:14:23,360 --> 00:14:24,720
and there's hundreds of devs you will

414
00:14:24,720 --> 00:14:26,720
never be able to keep up with this but

415
00:14:26,720 --> 00:14:28,320
if you have a really great qa team

416
00:14:28,320 --> 00:14:30,639
that's doing automation first of all

417
00:14:30,639 --> 00:14:32,639
they should be your best friends forever

418
00:14:32,639 --> 00:14:34,079
because they are testers and you are a

419
00:14:34,079 --> 00:14:35,279
tester

420
00:14:35,279 --> 00:14:37,040
and two because if they're doing

421
00:14:37,040 --> 00:14:39,680
automation why not get more value from

422
00:14:39,680 --> 00:14:41,680
the work that they do so another thing

423
00:14:41,680 --> 00:14:43,040
you can do so

424
00:14:43,040 --> 00:14:45,680
this sounds zen or like just only test

425
00:14:45,680 --> 00:14:47,360
if it worries you and what you feel like

426
00:14:47,360 --> 00:14:49,279
testing that's not what i mean so

427
00:14:49,279 --> 00:14:51,360
whenever i start doing consulting

428
00:14:51,360 --> 00:14:53,440
somewhere the first thing i do

429
00:14:53,440 --> 00:14:55,279
is i go through all our previous scans i

430
00:14:55,279 --> 00:14:57,839
shove it into microsoft excel and then i

431
00:14:57,839 --> 00:15:00,399
do a bunch of vlookups and h lookups and

432
00:15:00,399 --> 00:15:02,000
then i figure out what their top three

433
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:05,040
problems are that i see all the time

434
00:15:05,040 --> 00:15:07,760
and spoiler alert two out of the three

435
00:15:07,760 --> 00:15:09,680
are almost always no one's using any

436
00:15:09,680 --> 00:15:12,000
security headers even the easy ones and

437
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:13,680
there's crosstalk scripting like there's

438
00:15:13,680 --> 00:15:15,040
no tomorrow

439
00:15:15,040 --> 00:15:17,199
and then the third one's always weird

440
00:15:17,199 --> 00:15:18,639
um and so

441
00:15:18,639 --> 00:15:20,720
i take that and i start

442
00:15:20,720 --> 00:15:22,320
telling everyone and singing the praises

443
00:15:22,320 --> 00:15:23,760
of security headers telling them all

444
00:15:23,760 --> 00:15:25,199
about it what i wish they would do

445
00:15:25,199 --> 00:15:27,839
differently and i

446
00:15:27,839 --> 00:15:29,920
basically i start testing for that and i

447
00:15:29,920 --> 00:15:32,399
start watching it go down i do longer

448
00:15:32,399 --> 00:15:35,120
tests not on the pipeline but i teach

449
00:15:35,120 --> 00:15:36,959
everyone about those things i ask them

450
00:15:36,959 --> 00:15:39,199
to fix those things i'm only scanning in

451
00:15:39,199 --> 00:15:41,279
the pipeline for those things and once

452
00:15:41,279 --> 00:15:43,360
everyone's passing that by that point

453
00:15:43,360 --> 00:15:44,560
i've figured out a new thing that's

454
00:15:44,560 --> 00:15:45,759
wrong that i want to work on and

455
00:15:45,759 --> 00:15:47,759
eliminate and then i start testing for

456
00:15:47,759 --> 00:15:49,759
those things instead and the idea is is

457
00:15:49,759 --> 00:15:51,680
that you can start seeing things get

458
00:15:51,680 --> 00:15:54,480
better and that is a beautiful thing

459
00:15:54,480 --> 00:15:56,320
technology specific test so everyone

460
00:15:56,320 --> 00:15:58,160
should just do this ever

461
00:15:58,160 --> 00:16:00,800
so if let's say um you like you have a

462
00:16:00,800 --> 00:16:02,959
dynamic scanner and a special test for

463
00:16:02,959 --> 00:16:05,360
ruby a special test for microsoft sql

464
00:16:05,360 --> 00:16:08,240
server a special test for mongodb as

465
00:16:08,240 --> 00:16:09,920
special tests for wordpress as special

466
00:16:09,920 --> 00:16:12,399
tests etc etc for different

467
00:16:12,399 --> 00:16:14,320
technologies

468
00:16:14,320 --> 00:16:16,160
if your project

469
00:16:16,160 --> 00:16:18,480
is not using that technology

470
00:16:18,480 --> 00:16:22,000
turn off that test this seems super

471
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:24,399
obvious but most people forget or they

472
00:16:24,399 --> 00:16:27,279
just ignore it or they can't be bothered

473
00:16:27,279 --> 00:16:28,800
take that time

474
00:16:28,800 --> 00:16:31,680
like if if you have a wordpress site

475
00:16:31,680 --> 00:16:33,519
definitely keep it on but for everyone

476
00:16:33,519 --> 00:16:35,839
else just turn all of those things off

477
00:16:35,839 --> 00:16:38,480
only keep the ones that apply to you

478
00:16:38,480 --> 00:16:40,959
and then you will get better value out

479
00:16:40,959 --> 00:16:42,560
of the dynamic scanner because it has

480
00:16:42,560 --> 00:16:44,720
special tests for your thing turn all

481
00:16:44,720 --> 00:16:46,959
the rest of it off don't waste time

482
00:16:46,959 --> 00:16:47,759
okay

483
00:16:47,759 --> 00:16:48,639
so

484
00:16:48,639 --> 00:16:51,040
now i want to briefly break into testing

485
00:16:51,040 --> 00:16:52,959
apis because this is a thing that has

486
00:16:52,959 --> 00:16:54,720
just come up four thousand times and i

487
00:16:54,720 --> 00:16:56,399
feel like it's the secret that i want

488
00:16:56,399 --> 00:16:57,759
everyone to know so that it's no longer

489
00:16:57,759 --> 00:16:58,959
a secret and we don't have to worry

490
00:16:58,959 --> 00:17:02,079
about it anymore so when i first started

491
00:17:02,079 --> 00:17:04,079
uh pen testing very quickly people are

492
00:17:04,079 --> 00:17:06,079
like can you test apis i'm like i think

493
00:17:06,079 --> 00:17:06,959
so

494
00:17:06,959 --> 00:17:08,480
and i would run

495
00:17:08,480 --> 00:17:10,720
a dynamic scanner which i won't say the

496
00:17:10,720 --> 00:17:12,240
name of because it's like a competitor

497
00:17:12,240 --> 00:17:13,679
to ours and that's rude and you should

498
00:17:13,679 --> 00:17:15,760
never make fun of your competitors i

499
00:17:15,760 --> 00:17:18,400
believe in respect across the industry

500
00:17:18,400 --> 00:17:21,359
but there was a scanner that i was using

501
00:17:21,359 --> 00:17:23,679
and i would point it at our api and it

502
00:17:23,679 --> 00:17:26,079
was perfect

503
00:17:26,079 --> 00:17:27,119
perfect

504
00:17:27,119 --> 00:17:29,660
not even an informational and i was like

505
00:17:29,660 --> 00:17:30,799
[Music]

506
00:17:30,799 --> 00:17:32,640
okay and then i ran against another one

507
00:17:32,640 --> 00:17:35,120
and eventually i had run it against 27

508
00:17:35,120 --> 00:17:37,760
of our apis it said all of them were 100

509
00:17:37,760 --> 00:17:39,520
perfect i'm like i'm looking at it right

510
00:17:39,520 --> 00:17:42,240
now these cookie settings suck

511
00:17:42,240 --> 00:17:43,840
there's like no security headers there's

512
00:17:43,840 --> 00:17:45,600
this missing there's that bulb i can

513
00:17:45,600 --> 00:17:48,080
tell this is not and i'm not saying that

514
00:17:48,080 --> 00:17:49,679
my devs weren't good it's not what i'm

515
00:17:49,679 --> 00:17:51,039
saying i'm saying everyone makes

516
00:17:51,039 --> 00:17:53,840
mistakes if i write a chapter of a book

517
00:17:53,840 --> 00:17:54,799
you better believe it there's going to

518
00:17:54,799 --> 00:17:56,720
be a hundred different errors in it that

519
00:17:56,720 --> 00:17:58,320
someone else can see because it's a

520
00:17:58,320 --> 00:18:01,520
second set of eyes and so

521
00:18:01,520 --> 00:18:04,080
no developers including me especially me

522
00:18:04,080 --> 00:18:06,640
writes perfect code 100 of the time and

523
00:18:06,640 --> 00:18:08,960
there's 27 apis one of them is gonna

524
00:18:08,960 --> 00:18:10,720
have something wrong so i was like oh

525
00:18:10,720 --> 00:18:13,360
dynamic scanners just suck at apis no

526
00:18:13,360 --> 00:18:16,320
that's not what's wrong it turns out

527
00:18:16,320 --> 00:18:18,880
what you need to do is take your api

528
00:18:18,880 --> 00:18:21,520
definition file so your open api file

529
00:18:21,520 --> 00:18:22,880
sometimes called your swagger file if

530
00:18:22,880 --> 00:18:24,799
you're using a slightly older version

531
00:18:24,799 --> 00:18:28,640
you need to open that up and lint it so

532
00:18:28,640 --> 00:18:31,120
sometimes it's called an api schema

533
00:18:31,120 --> 00:18:32,960
an api definition file whatever you want

534
00:18:32,960 --> 00:18:36,080
to call it but you need to complete the

535
00:18:36,080 --> 00:18:38,559
file so when i as a dab i just be like

536
00:18:38,559 --> 00:18:40,640
hey here's a variable it's a string and

537
00:18:40,640 --> 00:18:42,960
then i do stuff with it but when api

538
00:18:42,960 --> 00:18:45,679
definition file prefers you would do

539
00:18:45,679 --> 00:18:47,919
it'd be like this is a variable it is a

540
00:18:47,919 --> 00:18:48,880
string

541
00:18:48,880 --> 00:18:50,720
it contains

542
00:18:50,720 --> 00:18:52,960
lowercase letters a through z and

543
00:18:52,960 --> 00:18:55,280
uppercase letters a through z and zero

544
00:18:55,280 --> 00:18:58,000
through nine and that's all it contains

545
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:00,400
and it is a minimum of five characters

546
00:19:00,400 --> 00:19:03,760
but it's maximum of a hundred characters

547
00:19:03,760 --> 00:19:05,919
when you tell it that much detail the

548
00:19:05,919 --> 00:19:09,039
api can defend itself it now has input

549
00:19:09,039 --> 00:19:11,200
validation and then when you give that

550
00:19:11,200 --> 00:19:13,679
api definition file to the dynamic

551
00:19:13,679 --> 00:19:15,440
scanner it's like oh i'm going to go to

552
00:19:15,440 --> 00:19:17,679
town now i'm going to test all those

553
00:19:17,679 --> 00:19:20,000
things and make sure it's tough so it's

554
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:22,400
very important that you link to your api

555
00:19:22,400 --> 00:19:25,200
and complete your api definition file

556
00:19:25,200 --> 00:19:27,919
all right now you know the secret

557
00:19:27,919 --> 00:19:29,919
so here is another secret you can still

558
00:19:29,919 --> 00:19:31,840
be in a devops environment

559
00:19:31,840 --> 00:19:33,520
and not put 100

560
00:19:33,520 --> 00:19:34,960
of your tests

561
00:19:34,960 --> 00:19:37,200
in the pipeline

562
00:19:37,200 --> 00:19:39,440
you can still do a good job get good

563
00:19:39,440 --> 00:19:42,000
results and have your boss like you

564
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:42,880
and

565
00:19:42,880 --> 00:19:44,720
be like make your organization more

566
00:19:44,720 --> 00:19:46,480
secure effectively by putting some

567
00:19:46,480 --> 00:19:49,280
things in the pipeline like for instance

568
00:19:49,280 --> 00:19:51,200
only technology specific tests that

569
00:19:51,200 --> 00:19:54,320
apply applying a her file and then

570
00:19:54,320 --> 00:19:56,320
perhaps um

571
00:19:56,320 --> 00:19:58,320
oh there's just so many things just only

572
00:19:58,320 --> 00:19:59,679
doing the scope that is important to

573
00:19:59,679 --> 00:20:02,559
your only doing the you know three top

574
00:20:02,559 --> 00:20:04,559
things are important to you at that time

575
00:20:04,559 --> 00:20:07,280
but you still want to do other testing

576
00:20:07,280 --> 00:20:08,640
because you still need to take a very

577
00:20:08,640 --> 00:20:11,039
good look at the app so what else can

578
00:20:11,039 --> 00:20:13,039
you do

579
00:20:13,039 --> 00:20:14,960
so a thing i like to do

580
00:20:14,960 --> 00:20:16,320
and maybe you're going to think this is

581
00:20:16,320 --> 00:20:19,679
boring but scheduled automated regular

582
00:20:19,679 --> 00:20:22,159
scanning it can be improv or pre-prod

583
00:20:22,159 --> 00:20:24,480
but you want to look just like prod

584
00:20:24,480 --> 00:20:26,799
run it every week and check to see if

585
00:20:26,799 --> 00:20:28,799
there's anything new check to see if

586
00:20:28,799 --> 00:20:30,480
your scanner needs to update always do

587
00:20:30,480 --> 00:20:32,559
updates if it's a sas product cool it's

588
00:20:32,559 --> 00:20:35,120
updating itself but if you have it

589
00:20:35,120 --> 00:20:37,520
installed always turn it on

590
00:20:37,520 --> 00:20:39,440
run all the updates then run your scan

591
00:20:39,440 --> 00:20:41,280
because there's probably new tests maybe

592
00:20:41,280 --> 00:20:43,039
bug fixes and other cool stuff in those

593
00:20:43,039 --> 00:20:45,440
updates always run those updates

594
00:20:45,440 --> 00:20:48,320
but you can have your scanner run on the

595
00:20:48,320 --> 00:20:49,840
weekend and test every single thing in

596
00:20:49,840 --> 00:20:51,760
prod or pre-prod depending upon how safe

597
00:20:51,760 --> 00:20:53,520
your scanner is

598
00:20:53,520 --> 00:20:54,960
take a look at those results on monday

599
00:20:54,960 --> 00:20:56,960
it doesn't matter if it runs 18 hours

600
00:20:56,960 --> 00:20:58,080
it's okay

601
00:20:58,080 --> 00:20:59,520
you look at it on monday and you're like

602
00:20:59,520 --> 00:21:00,960
oh that looks like nothing but that

603
00:21:00,960 --> 00:21:02,640
looks kind of scary i should talk to

604
00:21:02,640 --> 00:21:03,919
them about that

605
00:21:03,919 --> 00:21:06,159
and it's okay to do a super long test if

606
00:21:06,159 --> 00:21:08,320
no one's waiting on you

607
00:21:08,320 --> 00:21:10,480
another thing you can do is one off or

608
00:21:10,480 --> 00:21:13,360
manual scans so whenever i get a tool or

609
00:21:13,360 --> 00:21:15,360
i get an app for the first time i'm not

610
00:21:15,360 --> 00:21:16,480
saying they're

611
00:21:16,480 --> 00:21:18,880
perfecting my cicd pipeline call i

612
00:21:18,880 --> 00:21:22,240
immediately just be like punch directly

613
00:21:22,240 --> 00:21:24,320
i just want to point my scanner on it be

614
00:21:24,320 --> 00:21:26,960
like tell me what is up

615
00:21:26,960 --> 00:21:29,120
the first time you get a tool this is

616
00:21:29,120 --> 00:21:30,880
how you learn about it this is how you

617
00:21:30,880 --> 00:21:32,159
configure it and play with it and

618
00:21:32,159 --> 00:21:33,520
eventually you get better and better and

619
00:21:33,520 --> 00:21:35,039
the first time i have an app i want a

620
00:21:35,039 --> 00:21:37,280
complete look at everything

621
00:21:37,280 --> 00:21:39,280
and then i'm going to start scheduling

622
00:21:39,280 --> 00:21:40,960
things or automating things in other

623
00:21:40,960 --> 00:21:42,960
ways but the first time you look at

624
00:21:42,960 --> 00:21:44,320
something you want to know what you're

625
00:21:44,320 --> 00:21:45,600
dealing with

626
00:21:45,600 --> 00:21:46,480
and so

627
00:21:46,480 --> 00:21:48,240
there is there is still a point for

628
00:21:48,240 --> 00:21:52,000
manual scans penetration testing so

629
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:53,919
a lot of um

630
00:21:53,919 --> 00:21:56,080
highly effective pen test shops i've

631
00:21:56,080 --> 00:21:57,840
seen what they'll do is they'll roll out

632
00:21:57,840 --> 00:22:01,440
a desk that has low false positive rate

633
00:22:01,440 --> 00:22:03,120
and basically they'll go see a client

634
00:22:03,120 --> 00:22:04,400
they have a kickoff meeting they talk to

635
00:22:04,400 --> 00:22:05,440
them a bit they're like whatever you've

636
00:22:05,440 --> 00:22:07,520
got i'm gonna scan it now and they just

637
00:22:07,520 --> 00:22:08,880
run the scan and they're like listen

638
00:22:08,880 --> 00:22:10,640
this is what we found so far we will be

639
00:22:10,640 --> 00:22:12,880
back in a month when you're ready we

640
00:22:12,880 --> 00:22:15,520
want all that fixed don't pay our manual

641
00:22:15,520 --> 00:22:18,000
expert like our experts to spend manual

642
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:19,840
testing time find things that we could

643
00:22:19,840 --> 00:22:21,919
just find with the desk make us work for

644
00:22:21,919 --> 00:22:25,039
our paycheck so i've seen uh when i was

645
00:22:25,039 --> 00:22:26,480
a pentester i started doing that i

646
00:22:26,480 --> 00:22:27,919
remember my boss was like why are you

647
00:22:27,919 --> 00:22:30,240
helping them cheat

648
00:22:30,240 --> 00:22:32,000
but when you do that you save the client

649
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:33,520
time you give them more time to fix

650
00:22:33,520 --> 00:22:35,440
those critical bugs

651
00:22:35,440 --> 00:22:37,919
and a client gets more value so

652
00:22:37,919 --> 00:22:39,440
penetration testers they use a whole

653
00:22:39,440 --> 00:22:40,960
bunch of tools they do a lot of manual

654
00:22:40,960 --> 00:22:42,159
things but there's still a lot of

655
00:22:42,159 --> 00:22:44,559
automated testing going on

656
00:22:44,559 --> 00:22:46,240
there are other tests like i said

657
00:22:46,240 --> 00:22:47,919
earlier you can't

658
00:22:47,919 --> 00:22:50,400
just do das it's not enough i know that

659
00:22:50,400 --> 00:22:51,600
i work for a desk company so i'm

660
00:22:51,600 --> 00:22:52,880
probably supposed to tell you that it is

661
00:22:52,880 --> 00:22:55,600
but it's not other important security

662
00:22:55,600 --> 00:22:57,120
tests include

663
00:22:57,120 --> 00:22:59,520
static analysis so that's analysis of

664
00:22:59,520 --> 00:23:01,840
the code the custom code that your team

665
00:23:01,840 --> 00:23:04,320
wrote that makes your app

666
00:23:04,320 --> 00:23:06,960
unique snowflake

667
00:23:06,960 --> 00:23:09,440
software composition analysis so this is

668
00:23:09,440 --> 00:23:11,679
checking all your dependencies so this

669
00:23:11,679 --> 00:23:13,280
means making your sure that your

670
00:23:13,280 --> 00:23:16,960
software supply chain is actually safe

671
00:23:16,960 --> 00:23:19,280
is this is interactive application

672
00:23:19,280 --> 00:23:22,000
security testing and this is a new seven

673
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:24,320
or eight years old now but a newer type

674
00:23:24,320 --> 00:23:26,240
of technology that helps you test from

675
00:23:26,240 --> 00:23:28,080
the inside out

676
00:23:28,080 --> 00:23:30,240
secret scanning so although static

677
00:23:30,240 --> 00:23:32,320
analysis tools do this i still like to

678
00:23:32,320 --> 00:23:34,080
run secret scans especially on check-in

679
00:23:34,080 --> 00:23:36,080
so i can stop people from putting you

680
00:23:36,080 --> 00:23:37,840
know an api key or something else that

681
00:23:37,840 --> 00:23:40,000
should remain a secret into the code

682
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:43,279
where it is no longer a secret

683
00:23:43,279 --> 00:23:44,960
okay so i want to show you briefly

684
00:23:44,960 --> 00:23:46,320
because i had a lot of people ask me

685
00:23:46,320 --> 00:23:48,240
about this where can you do dynamic

686
00:23:48,240 --> 00:23:50,000
scanning in the system development life

687
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:52,240
cycle so the first place is

688
00:23:52,240 --> 00:23:53,919
the very first time code runs which is

689
00:23:53,919 --> 00:23:55,760
in a unit test so if you have devs

690
00:23:55,760 --> 00:23:57,200
writing good unit tests you can do

691
00:23:57,200 --> 00:24:00,559
security unit tests so you can send them

692
00:24:00,559 --> 00:24:02,799
malicious input to make sure that not

693
00:24:02,799 --> 00:24:05,279
only they do what they should do

694
00:24:05,279 --> 00:24:06,880
but they do not do

695
00:24:06,880 --> 00:24:09,440
things they should not do

696
00:24:09,440 --> 00:24:11,520
and so then if you write security unit

697
00:24:11,520 --> 00:24:13,760
tests every time you check your code in

698
00:24:13,760 --> 00:24:15,679
you run those and you do regression

699
00:24:15,679 --> 00:24:17,600
testing so making sure any new features

700
00:24:17,600 --> 00:24:19,840
or changes you've made don't cause new

701
00:24:19,840 --> 00:24:21,360
security bugs

702
00:24:21,360 --> 00:24:22,880
and then next

703
00:24:22,880 --> 00:24:25,039
if you are publishing to a dynamics

704
00:24:25,039 --> 00:24:27,440
uh if you're publishing to a dev server

705
00:24:27,440 --> 00:24:29,120
or even if you're running in localhost

706
00:24:29,120 --> 00:24:30,880
you can spin up your app and you can

707
00:24:30,880 --> 00:24:32,960
just yourself pew pew pew pew run a

708
00:24:32,960 --> 00:24:35,120
dynamic scanner on it find those bugs

709
00:24:35,120 --> 00:24:38,799
fix them and then send it on to qa that

710
00:24:38,799 --> 00:24:41,440
will hopefully run a full dynamic scan

711
00:24:41,440 --> 00:24:43,440
they're like i have lots of time i am in

712
00:24:43,440 --> 00:24:46,400
a waterfall situation where i'm in agile

713
00:24:46,400 --> 00:24:48,400
and i'm gonna just run on this one new

714
00:24:48,400 --> 00:24:50,480
cool feature whatever it is that they're

715
00:24:50,480 --> 00:24:52,000
doing you can do that in the testing

716
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:54,720
phase also manual penetration testing

717
00:24:54,720 --> 00:24:57,039
there's an option for that there as well

718
00:24:57,039 --> 00:24:58,960
then once you release

719
00:24:58,960 --> 00:25:01,440
in your release pipeline again a tuned

720
00:25:01,440 --> 00:25:03,120
dash so that's what it's called when you

721
00:25:03,120 --> 00:25:05,520
remove tests that don't apply or you

722
00:25:05,520 --> 00:25:07,840
hone in on only certain features etc

723
00:25:07,840 --> 00:25:10,400
that is called tuning your tool and then

724
00:25:10,400 --> 00:25:12,960
lastly scheduled weekly tests or monthly

725
00:25:12,960 --> 00:25:15,360
tests depending upon

726
00:25:15,360 --> 00:25:16,640
how much time you have to look at

727
00:25:16,640 --> 00:25:18,159
reports basically

728
00:25:18,159 --> 00:25:20,400
i mean it's usually free to just run the

729
00:25:20,400 --> 00:25:21,760
scanner as much as you want if you have

730
00:25:21,760 --> 00:25:25,360
a good license so weekly is fine

731
00:25:25,360 --> 00:25:26,799
so i bet you're thinking at this point

732
00:25:26,799 --> 00:25:28,559
so this is when i can run a dynamic

733
00:25:28,559 --> 00:25:31,440
scanner but how does it feel

734
00:25:31,440 --> 00:25:33,200
it's how does it ask feel

735
00:25:33,200 --> 00:25:35,039
when you're running it so this is how i

736
00:25:35,039 --> 00:25:36,640
feel when i run a dust i kind of feel

737
00:25:36,640 --> 00:25:38,880
like these little kittens i feel like

738
00:25:38,880 --> 00:25:41,120
every it's really important to know how

739
00:25:41,120 --> 00:25:43,120
it feels when you do testing like this

740
00:25:43,120 --> 00:25:45,679
is how i feel when i'm using a desk

741
00:25:45,679 --> 00:25:47,840
some of my friends feel like that

742
00:25:47,840 --> 00:25:49,039
some of the people at bright told me

743
00:25:49,039 --> 00:25:50,400
that's how they feel

744
00:25:50,400 --> 00:25:52,400
but this is definitely me

745
00:25:52,400 --> 00:25:54,159
when i'm listening to music and i'm

746
00:25:54,159 --> 00:25:56,000
running a death so basically it's

747
00:25:56,000 --> 00:25:59,360
important to know how you feel

748
00:25:59,360 --> 00:26:01,279
you have to have a certain number of cat

749
00:26:01,279 --> 00:26:03,840
memes in your infosec presentations or

750
00:26:03,840 --> 00:26:05,840
else you get sued it's just a lie i

751
00:26:05,840 --> 00:26:07,679
don't make the rules it's just true so

752
00:26:07,679 --> 00:26:09,440
conclusion

753
00:26:09,440 --> 00:26:12,080
we must do dynamic scanning because if

754
00:26:12,080 --> 00:26:14,080
your app is on the internet

755
00:26:14,080 --> 00:26:16,400
anyone can point that tool at it

756
00:26:16,400 --> 00:26:18,720
they can find things wrong you want to

757
00:26:18,720 --> 00:26:21,600
fix those things yourself do not want

758
00:26:21,600 --> 00:26:23,679
the first time that you find out about

759
00:26:23,679 --> 00:26:25,840
it be a malicious actor

760
00:26:25,840 --> 00:26:27,520
you want to find the easy things

761
00:26:27,520 --> 00:26:28,799
yourself

762
00:26:28,799 --> 00:26:30,400
automation is our friend if you're at

763
00:26:30,400 --> 00:26:33,200
devsecond you already know that

764
00:26:33,200 --> 00:26:36,000
so dynamic testing in a pipeline must be

765
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:39,200
fast and accurate or you will

766
00:26:39,200 --> 00:26:41,120
cause problems with your relationships

767
00:26:41,120 --> 00:26:42,880
with other teams you will be causing a

768
00:26:42,880 --> 00:26:44,720
ton of friction

769
00:26:44,720 --> 00:26:46,480
we can do dynamic testing outside the

770
00:26:46,480 --> 00:26:48,320
pipeline and still be devops friendly

771
00:26:48,320 --> 00:26:50,880
you can still be awesome you're not

772
00:26:50,880 --> 00:26:52,559
failing if you do things outside the

773
00:26:52,559 --> 00:26:54,240
pipeline i've seen people think this

774
00:26:54,240 --> 00:26:55,600
that's not true

775
00:26:55,600 --> 00:26:57,919
if you are still securing your org and

776
00:26:57,919 --> 00:26:59,919
you have good relationships with dev and

777
00:26:59,919 --> 00:27:01,440
ops and they are getting their job done

778
00:27:01,440 --> 00:27:04,159
and you are too you are amazing

779
00:27:04,159 --> 00:27:05,760
other types of testing are still needed

780
00:27:05,760 --> 00:27:07,520
to find as many vulnerabilities as

781
00:27:07,520 --> 00:27:08,640
possible

782
00:27:08,640 --> 00:27:10,480
and lastly the people from bright are

783
00:27:10,480 --> 00:27:12,080
pretty silly

784
00:27:12,080 --> 00:27:14,799
mostly me but i like to think that bars

785
00:27:14,799 --> 00:27:17,120
anyway we're silly okay so now i have

786
00:27:17,120 --> 00:27:19,440
some free resources for you and i'm not

787
00:27:19,440 --> 00:27:21,840
sure how i'm doing on time but here are

788
00:27:21,840 --> 00:27:22,799
some

789
00:27:22,799 --> 00:27:24,399
almost all free so the books aren't free

790
00:27:24,399 --> 00:27:26,640
but everything else is free so yay free

791
00:27:26,640 --> 00:27:29,360
stuff okay so i have a podcast the we

792
00:27:29,360 --> 00:27:31,919
have purple podcast the first season is

793
00:27:31,919 --> 00:27:33,440
all the different jobs that exist in

794
00:27:33,440 --> 00:27:35,360
information security what they're like

795
00:27:35,360 --> 00:27:38,000
and how to get one and then season two

796
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:40,320
which is new is short little mini

797
00:27:40,320 --> 00:27:42,159
lessons where we learn a thing about

798
00:27:42,159 --> 00:27:44,320
security that i didn't know basically

799
00:27:44,320 --> 00:27:45,919
it's my excuse to invite people i think

800
00:27:45,919 --> 00:27:48,159
are cool on my podcast and then ask them

801
00:27:48,159 --> 00:27:49,120
questions

802
00:27:49,120 --> 00:27:50,480
it is on

803
00:27:50,480 --> 00:27:53,760
all the podcast places and on youtube

804
00:27:53,760 --> 00:27:55,360
so like i said none of these books are

805
00:27:55,360 --> 00:27:57,600
free but the first four books are just

806
00:27:57,600 --> 00:28:00,159
about devops i do not believe we can do

807
00:28:00,159 --> 00:28:03,200
security right if we are not doing it

808
00:28:03,200 --> 00:28:04,000
right

809
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:06,559
and for me in my opinion

810
00:28:06,559 --> 00:28:10,080
devops is the best way to build software

811
00:28:10,080 --> 00:28:12,000
i like i'm not saying that i hate the

812
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:13,760
other ways i'm saying i feel it's just

813
00:28:13,760 --> 00:28:15,200
the best way

814
00:28:15,200 --> 00:28:17,279
and i love these books and i wrote the

815
00:28:17,279 --> 00:28:20,240
last book and i think alison bob learn

816
00:28:20,240 --> 00:28:22,640
is excellent and my mom says it is too i

817
00:28:22,640 --> 00:28:24,480
don't think she read the whole thing

818
00:28:24,480 --> 00:28:27,520
okay so also join the community so last

819
00:28:27,520 --> 00:28:30,480
month my company was acquired by bright

820
00:28:30,480 --> 00:28:32,640
and so now all that we have purple

821
00:28:32,640 --> 00:28:34,880
courses are free so if you join the

822
00:28:34,880 --> 00:28:36,640
community which is free

823
00:28:36,640 --> 00:28:37,919
there's no upsell there's nothing that

824
00:28:37,919 --> 00:28:40,640
we sell you in there um all the academy

825
00:28:40,640 --> 00:28:42,559
courses are now in there for free so

826
00:28:42,559 --> 00:28:45,279
appsx secure coding azure security

827
00:28:45,279 --> 00:28:47,919
ci cd pipelines and desk all that stuff

828
00:28:47,919 --> 00:28:50,799
all that is free

829
00:28:50,799 --> 00:28:54,880
okay next every monday on twitter

830
00:28:54,880 --> 00:28:58,559

that thank you tanya i may have some

911
00:31:51,919 --> 00:31:53,600
more specific questions regarding

912
00:31:53,600 --> 00:31:55,760
questions and mobile automated seg

913
00:31:55,760 --> 00:31:58,320
testing so when we talk about

914
00:31:58,320 --> 00:32:00,559
testing and putting it in a cicd

915
00:32:00,559 --> 00:32:02,720
pipeline how exactly we can do it for

916
00:32:02,720 --> 00:32:04,640
mobile applications

917
00:32:04,640 --> 00:32:05,679
um

918
00:32:05,679 --> 00:32:08,240
i have only tested a mobile app manually

919
00:32:08,240 --> 00:32:09,279
before

920
00:32:09,279 --> 00:32:12,559
so generally i like proxy

921
00:32:12,559 --> 00:32:14,960
like through my phone i would proxy it

922
00:32:14,960 --> 00:32:16,799
and then use a dynamic scanner or web

923
00:32:16,799 --> 00:32:18,880
proxy to manually test

924
00:32:18,880 --> 00:32:20,799
i haven't been able to do it in a ci cd

925
00:32:20,799 --> 00:32:23,279
pipeline but i also haven't been a pen

926
00:32:23,279 --> 00:32:24,399
tester for

927
00:32:24,399 --> 00:32:27,039
five years and things have changed quite

928
00:32:27,039 --> 00:32:28,480
a bit since then

929
00:32:28,480 --> 00:32:31,519
and so i mostly do appsec now and i tend

930
00:32:31,519 --> 00:32:33,840
to focus a lot on

931
00:32:33,840 --> 00:32:35,760
companies that are taking huge

932
00:32:35,760 --> 00:32:37,679
monolithic applications and reworking

933
00:32:37,679 --> 00:32:39,760
them into microservice architectures so

934
00:32:39,760 --> 00:32:42,240
i do a lot of api stuff and with a

935
00:32:42,240 --> 00:32:43,760
mobile app

936
00:32:43,760 --> 00:32:46,000
usually quite frankly it's a bit of a

937
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:47,919
gui and there might be like a hybrid

938
00:32:47,919 --> 00:32:49,760
situation and maybe they're caching data

939
00:32:49,760 --> 00:32:51,760
locally but like usually all the heavy

940
00:32:51,760 --> 00:32:54,240
duty work is done by apis

941
00:32:54,240 --> 00:32:56,640
so all the api stuff if you want could

942
00:32:56,640 --> 00:32:59,360
still be tested with a ci cd pipeline it

943
00:32:59,360 --> 00:33:00,880
might sound weird to test the back end

944
00:33:00,880 --> 00:33:03,120
separately than the front end but i

945
00:33:03,120 --> 00:33:05,279
believe you should test the front end

946
00:33:05,279 --> 00:33:06,880
and you should separately test each of

947
00:33:06,880 --> 00:33:09,200
the apis on their own

948
00:33:09,200 --> 00:33:10,960
i hope that doesn't sound weird or

949
00:33:10,960 --> 00:33:12,399
really strict but i guess that's what

950
00:33:12,399 --> 00:33:16,158
i'm like i hope that helps

951
00:33:16,240 --> 00:33:18,720
yeah absolutely it helps it totally

952
00:33:18,720 --> 00:33:20,159
helps with this

953
00:33:20,159 --> 00:33:22,480
there are few times uh when we talk

954
00:33:22,480 --> 00:33:25,440
about mobile based applications uh or in

955
00:33:25,440 --> 00:33:27,440
some ways it is different but again

956
00:33:27,440 --> 00:33:28,960
there are a few test cases which are

957
00:33:28,960 --> 00:33:31,120
actually similar to the web applications

958
00:33:31,120 --> 00:33:33,039
but uh there's one thing i do want to

959
00:33:33,039 --> 00:33:35,039
add about mobile uh verification

960
00:33:35,039 --> 00:33:38,159
standard or msvs from owasp probably

961
00:33:38,159 --> 00:33:39,919
they can take a look at it there are

962
00:33:39,919 --> 00:33:41,679
really amazing guidelines there which

963
00:33:41,679 --> 00:33:44,399
can actually help them

964
00:33:44,399 --> 00:33:45,760
thank you

965
00:33:45,760 --> 00:33:47,279
i like it when other people help me

966
00:33:47,279 --> 00:33:49,360
answer questions it's good i look much

967
00:33:49,360 --> 00:33:51,120
