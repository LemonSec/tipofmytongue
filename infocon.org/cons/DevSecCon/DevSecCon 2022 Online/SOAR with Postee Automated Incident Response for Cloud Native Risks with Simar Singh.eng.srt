[Music]

2
00:00:04,080 --> 00:00:05,120
so um

3
00:00:05,120 --> 00:00:07,120
uh looking forward to hearing from uh

4
00:00:07,120 --> 00:00:10,639
aqua um from mr siemersing and

5
00:00:10,639 --> 00:00:12,240
we'll be hearing about cloud native

6
00:00:12,240 --> 00:00:15,280
incident response so how we automate the

7
00:00:15,280 --> 00:00:18,560
many different and good afternoon

8
00:00:18,560 --> 00:00:20,640

00:00:42,079 --> 00:00:45,840
just gonna make it bigger

19
00:00:47,920 --> 00:00:50,399
all right can you folks see um the big

20
00:00:50,399 --> 00:00:51,920
presentation

21
00:00:51,920 --> 00:00:56,000
uh i think we can oh it's just it's

22
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:58,160
redrawing extreme slowly at the minute

23
00:00:58,160 --> 00:01:00,000
for some reason there we go

24
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,079
got there in the end fantastic so the

25
00:01:02,079 --> 00:01:04,080
floor is yours

26
00:01:04,080 --> 00:01:06,000
all right um

27
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:09,119
uh hi this is samar um i work at aqua

28
00:01:09,119 --> 00:01:11,119
and i'll be talking about

29
00:01:11,119 --> 00:01:13,280
how you can automate incidence response

30
00:01:13,280 --> 00:01:14,320
with

31
00:01:14,320 --> 00:01:16,880
possible climative risks

32
00:01:16,880 --> 00:01:17,680
um

33
00:01:17,680 --> 00:01:19,119
i was just listening to the last

34
00:01:19,119 --> 00:01:21,280
presentation and then it was great to

35
00:01:21,280 --> 00:01:23,920
hear that security is a

36
00:01:23,920 --> 00:01:26,320
people's problem first and you know not

37
00:01:26,320 --> 00:01:28,960
a type problem uh

38
00:01:28,960 --> 00:01:31,200
that was that was great to hear um so

39
00:01:31,200 --> 00:01:33,520
i'll just be adding on that a little bit

40
00:01:33,520 --> 00:01:34,640
today

41
00:01:34,640 --> 00:01:36,560
um so this

42
00:01:36,560 --> 00:01:39,920
brief agenda for today's talk will be

43
00:01:39,920 --> 00:01:42,240
you know some patterns that we see um

44
00:01:42,240 --> 00:01:44,399
challenges with those and

45
00:01:44,399 --> 00:01:46,880
some solutions that i have and a quick

46
00:01:46,880 --> 00:01:48,720
demo

47
00:01:48,720 --> 00:01:51,360
um so we've all heard um or overheard in

48
00:01:51,360 --> 00:01:54,000
the office or wherever you are

49
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:55,680
that security is a requirement and not

50
00:01:55,680 --> 00:01:57,200
an option

51
00:01:57,200 --> 00:01:58,159
um

52
00:01:58,159 --> 00:02:00,880
and for that you know we always

53
00:02:00,880 --> 00:02:02,880
end up running multiple scanning

54
00:02:02,880 --> 00:02:04,960
solutions these are just some of them to

55
00:02:04,960 --> 00:02:08,000
list but then you also in the morning

56
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:10,080
wake up with this

57
00:02:10,080 --> 00:02:13,760
mailbox full of notifications um

58
00:02:13,760 --> 00:02:15,920
and then you start to realize what you

59
00:02:15,920 --> 00:02:17,280
signed up for

60
00:02:17,280 --> 00:02:20,160
um so alert fatigue is real

61
00:02:20,160 --> 00:02:22,480
nobody wants to see this everyone wants

62
00:02:22,480 --> 00:02:25,280
to strike friend doctor at least i do

63
00:02:25,280 --> 00:02:28,239
um and this was um

64
00:02:28,239 --> 00:02:31,599
very well documented and basically god

65
00:02:31,599 --> 00:02:33,760
people could um

66
00:02:33,760 --> 00:02:36,560
all know this better than anyone else

67
00:02:36,560 --> 00:02:38,959
and they came up with some really good

68
00:02:38,959 --> 00:02:41,120
recommendations for

69
00:02:41,120 --> 00:02:42,319
what makes

70
00:02:42,319 --> 00:02:43,760
a good alert

71
00:02:43,760 --> 00:02:47,760
and some of them i'll just summarize

72
00:02:47,760 --> 00:02:48,640
are

73
00:02:48,640 --> 00:02:51,040
a good alert let's say you're in the

74
00:02:51,040 --> 00:02:52,720
midnight um

75
00:02:52,720 --> 00:02:54,400
start a minute and you just wake up with

76
00:02:54,400 --> 00:02:56,879
the page um should be actionable you

77
00:02:56,879 --> 00:02:58,400
should be able to know what to do with

78
00:02:58,400 --> 00:02:59,120
it

79
00:02:59,120 --> 00:03:01,840
um it should be descriptive but most

80
00:03:01,840 --> 00:03:03,599
importantly should go to the right

81
00:03:03,599 --> 00:03:05,040
people you don't want to get a page for

82
00:03:05,040 --> 00:03:07,280
something that you have no control over

83
00:03:07,280 --> 00:03:10,000
or you don't want to do

84
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:11,519
but what makes

85
00:03:11,519 --> 00:03:13,680
an ideal alert would be

86
00:03:13,680 --> 00:03:15,599
all that

87
00:03:15,599 --> 00:03:16,879
plus

88
00:03:16,879 --> 00:03:19,519
if it was automated and now

89
00:03:19,519 --> 00:03:22,159
there are many definitions and

90
00:03:22,159 --> 00:03:24,239
people go um

91
00:03:24,239 --> 00:03:25,120
you know

92
00:03:25,120 --> 00:03:26,480
various

93
00:03:26,480 --> 00:03:29,040
definitions of like what it needs to be

94
00:03:29,040 --> 00:03:30,239
automated

95
00:03:30,239 --> 00:03:32,959
some call it self-healing some call it

96
00:03:32,959 --> 00:03:35,599
self-resolving automated playbooks

97
00:03:35,599 --> 00:03:38,000
whatever you might call it but ideally

98
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:39,519
the alert

99
00:03:39,519 --> 00:03:42,000
should know what to do um when it comes

100
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:44,560
or at least have a course of action

101
00:03:44,560 --> 00:03:48,159
before a humor operator gets involved

102
00:03:48,159 --> 00:03:50,319
because as you all know human

103
00:03:50,319 --> 00:03:52,080
time is expensive

104
00:03:52,080 --> 00:03:53,439
and some of these alerts can get

105
00:03:53,439 --> 00:03:56,000
repetitive especially if they

106
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:57,760
are known to the person

107
00:03:57,760 --> 00:03:59,519
before it happened

108
00:03:59,519 --> 00:04:02,640
um so the title of my talk sort of

109
00:04:02,640 --> 00:04:05,680
posted is actually an acronym which

110
00:04:05,680 --> 00:04:07,200
you know stands for security

111
00:04:07,200 --> 00:04:09,519
orchestration automation response

112
00:04:09,519 --> 00:04:12,319
um so for this talk i'll be focusing on

113
00:04:12,319 --> 00:04:14,959
the automation and the response piece of

114
00:04:14,959 --> 00:04:16,478
uh posty

115
00:04:16,478 --> 00:04:20,079
and what you can do um today uh with it

116
00:04:20,079 --> 00:04:21,759
so without further ado i like to

117
00:04:21,759 --> 00:04:23,759
introduce

118
00:04:23,759 --> 00:04:26,960
um what is posty uh posty is essentially

119
00:04:26,960 --> 00:04:29,759
a message routing system so it takes

120
00:04:29,759 --> 00:04:31,440
messages from

121
00:04:31,440 --> 00:04:33,040
one producer

122
00:04:33,040 --> 00:04:35,120
operates over them and then

123
00:04:35,120 --> 00:04:36,960
sends it out to uh

124
00:04:36,960 --> 00:04:39,120
to a different consumer

125
00:04:39,120 --> 00:04:42,160
or a place that's listing for them it is

126
00:04:42,160 --> 00:04:44,720
policy based so we use rego

127
00:04:44,720 --> 00:04:46,160
um

128
00:04:46,160 --> 00:04:49,120
to basically design our value

129
00:04:49,120 --> 00:04:51,440
for for all the messages that come in so

130
00:04:51,440 --> 00:04:53,199
you can write your own policies

131
00:04:53,199 --> 00:04:55,040
depending on how you want these messages

132
00:04:55,040 --> 00:04:56,240
to risky rabbit

133
00:04:56,240 --> 00:04:59,120
and most importantly uh we are

134
00:04:59,120 --> 00:05:01,199
there is enforcement on alerts that you

135
00:05:01,199 --> 00:05:02,080
get

136
00:05:02,080 --> 00:05:04,560
um so you can essentially have what we

137
00:05:04,560 --> 00:05:06,639
call post actions depending on where you

138
00:05:06,639 --> 00:05:08,000
want to do them

139
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:09,600
so i'll give some of those examples

140
00:05:09,600 --> 00:05:12,000
today and we'll see a few demos of that

141
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:13,440
as well

142
00:05:13,440 --> 00:05:14,160
so

143
00:05:14,160 --> 00:05:16,720
this is a high level overview um

144
00:05:16,720 --> 00:05:17,840
you know

145
00:05:17,840 --> 00:05:19,759
uh don't uh

146
00:05:19,759 --> 00:05:21,919
don't be worried if you you know can't

147
00:05:21,919 --> 00:05:23,280
understand the details but essentially

148
00:05:23,280 --> 00:05:25,680
there are three parts to closely versus

149
00:05:25,680 --> 00:05:27,600
the input

150
00:05:27,600 --> 00:05:29,120
which is essentially

151
00:05:29,120 --> 00:05:30,880
where all the production of messages

152
00:05:30,880 --> 00:05:32,960
happens so this could be any producer or

153
00:05:32,960 --> 00:05:34,880
messages could be

154
00:05:34,880 --> 00:05:36,400
your

155
00:05:36,400 --> 00:05:38,160
monitoring out could be your application

156
00:05:38,160 --> 00:05:40,080
itself could be anything

157
00:05:40,080 --> 00:05:41,840
um and then the second is the process

158
00:05:41,840 --> 00:05:43,440
which is supposed to itself so this is

159
00:05:43,440 --> 00:05:44,960
where your um

160
00:05:44,960 --> 00:05:47,120
policy based running comes in um

161
00:05:47,120 --> 00:05:48,880
messages are sent

162
00:05:48,880 --> 00:05:51,120
uh they're templated um out before

163
00:05:51,120 --> 00:05:52,880
they're sent to external applications

164
00:05:52,880 --> 00:05:55,360
and basically the whole engine um the

165
00:05:55,360 --> 00:05:57,520
policy engine lives uh within this

166
00:05:57,520 --> 00:05:58,560
process

167
00:05:58,560 --> 00:06:00,319
and the last um

168
00:06:00,319 --> 00:06:02,800
bit is execution so where the messages

169
00:06:02,800 --> 00:06:04,800
are actually sent out

170
00:06:04,800 --> 00:06:05,759
um

171
00:06:05,759 --> 00:06:08,880
from positive to other applications

172
00:06:08,880 --> 00:06:10,319
so

173
00:06:10,319 --> 00:06:14,240
we uh we wanted this um experience of

174
00:06:14,240 --> 00:06:16,479
using postdb as seamless as possible

175
00:06:16,479 --> 00:06:19,360
with our existing um apps so

176
00:06:19,360 --> 00:06:21,120
trivia is a vulnerability scanner that

177
00:06:21,120 --> 00:06:23,280
you can use today to scan

178
00:06:23,280 --> 00:06:24,880
a bunch of images

179
00:06:24,880 --> 00:06:28,560
um or or other artifacts and trace these

180
00:06:28,560 --> 00:06:30,639
runtime protection um scanner that you

181
00:06:30,639 --> 00:06:31,360
can

182
00:06:31,360 --> 00:06:34,560
set up in on your machine and

183
00:06:34,560 --> 00:06:37,520
and have uh runtime alerts come to you

184
00:06:37,520 --> 00:06:41,120
so today uh hostie and tracy um

185
00:06:41,120 --> 00:06:44,080
and hosting work seamlessly together and

186
00:06:44,080 --> 00:06:45,440
that's not to say that these are the

187
00:06:45,440 --> 00:06:47,360
only things that work together

188
00:06:47,360 --> 00:06:49,280
these are just one of the examples i'll

189
00:06:49,280 --> 00:06:51,840
be giving today um to showcase how

190
00:06:51,840 --> 00:06:54,560
closely can help you automate um the

191
00:06:54,560 --> 00:06:55,919
risks that you have

192
00:06:55,919 --> 00:06:59,120
so you can have any producer again um

193
00:06:59,120 --> 00:07:01,280
and then post the and that producer can

194
00:07:01,280 --> 00:07:05,039
talk over a bed hook and work alongside

195
00:07:05,039 --> 00:07:06,800
each other

196
00:07:06,800 --> 00:07:10,479
so for example postie and tracy um can

197
00:07:10,479 --> 00:07:13,199
work like this so tracy as i mentioned

198
00:07:13,199 --> 00:07:14,880
runs on the host

199
00:07:14,880 --> 00:07:17,520
it basically monitors for

200
00:07:17,520 --> 00:07:20,880
any runtime alerts that you may have

201
00:07:20,880 --> 00:07:21,840
while

202
00:07:21,840 --> 00:07:25,199
you're using your system or your node

203
00:07:25,199 --> 00:07:27,360
and tracy will basically observe this

204
00:07:27,360 --> 00:07:30,639
behavior using evpf uh technology and

205
00:07:30,639 --> 00:07:33,199
then generate an event and send it out

206
00:07:33,199 --> 00:07:35,440
to a consumer like fosee

207
00:07:35,440 --> 00:07:37,360
so postie gets that

208
00:07:37,360 --> 00:07:38,880
and then this is where the enforcement

209
00:07:38,880 --> 00:07:41,360
or the post the actions happen where

210
00:07:41,360 --> 00:07:42,960
postie again

211
00:07:42,960 --> 00:07:44,720
you can tell posty what to do when a

212
00:07:44,720 --> 00:07:46,879
certain kind of event happens so

213
00:07:46,879 --> 00:07:48,879
for instance you can have

214
00:07:48,879 --> 00:07:51,039
a process be terminated if it's doing

215
00:07:51,039 --> 00:07:54,800
malicious activity for example um and

216
00:07:54,800 --> 00:07:56,720
postie can enforce that

217
00:07:56,720 --> 00:07:58,720
on the node after it receives the event

218
00:07:58,720 --> 00:08:00,879
from crazy

219
00:08:00,879 --> 00:08:01,840
so

220
00:08:01,840 --> 00:08:05,440
very quick demo um

221
00:08:05,599 --> 00:08:07,919
on the right side of the screen you can

222
00:08:07,919 --> 00:08:10,080
see the configuration of posty it's

223
00:08:10,080 --> 00:08:13,280
basically a yama file you can configure

224
00:08:13,280 --> 00:08:15,120
with certain rules so the input that you

225
00:08:15,120 --> 00:08:16,800
see there is actually a regular policy

226
00:08:16,800 --> 00:08:18,720
it's a very simple regular policy that

227
00:08:18,720 --> 00:08:20,319
looks for

228
00:08:20,319 --> 00:08:22,080
a certain signature

229
00:08:22,080 --> 00:08:23,599
and i'm going to start

230
00:08:23,599 --> 00:08:25,919
posty and it's going to start listening

231
00:08:25,919 --> 00:08:27,759
for requests

232
00:08:27,759 --> 00:08:30,080
in the middle i'll start tracy which is

233
00:08:30,080 --> 00:08:31,360
basically remaining as a docker

234
00:08:31,360 --> 00:08:33,440
container and then i'm going to specify

235
00:08:33,440 --> 00:08:36,000
the output to go into webhook

236
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:38,000
which is developer where is

237
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:39,599
listening

238
00:08:39,599 --> 00:08:42,000
so then tracy's gonna start up it's

239
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:44,959
gonna start looking at stuff um

240
00:08:44,959 --> 00:08:48,480
and this is just a test um instant so

241
00:08:48,480 --> 00:08:51,519
right away you can see that there was um

242
00:08:51,519 --> 00:08:53,440
you know the kubernetes service account

243
00:08:53,440 --> 00:08:54,959
was accessed

244
00:08:54,959 --> 00:08:57,040
and then posted took that and send it

245
00:08:57,040 --> 00:08:58,959
over to a webhook because that was one

246
00:08:58,959 --> 00:09:00,399
of the um

247
00:09:00,399 --> 00:09:02,959
outputs that we configured closely to do

248
00:09:02,959 --> 00:09:05,519
so you can see all the historical

249
00:09:05,519 --> 00:09:07,600
events that have come in in the past as

250
00:09:07,600 --> 00:09:10,560
well this is just

251
00:09:10,560 --> 00:09:12,880
a way to look at them and this is the

252
00:09:12,880 --> 00:09:15,440
um the actual output of the

253
00:09:15,440 --> 00:09:17,360
tracy event that has come in so these

254
00:09:17,360 --> 00:09:19,760
are all the details of the producer that

255
00:09:19,760 --> 00:09:22,959
has sent us in this case tracy and

256
00:09:22,959 --> 00:09:24,800
kosti has forwarded them to their books

257
00:09:24,800 --> 00:09:26,160
so that's one

258
00:09:26,160 --> 00:09:26,880
um

259
00:09:26,880 --> 00:09:28,480
we're just having some problems with

260
00:09:28,480 --> 00:09:30,560
your screen not updating um can you just

261
00:09:30,560 --> 00:09:33,040
try uh unsharing and re-sharing again

262
00:09:33,040 --> 00:09:34,080
okay

263
00:09:34,080 --> 00:09:36,480
if that fixes it i just didn't want to

264
00:09:36,480 --> 00:09:38,399
uh

265
00:09:38,399 --> 00:09:42,000
need to um carry on

266
00:09:42,160 --> 00:09:45,519
just super slow updating for some reason

267
00:09:45,519 --> 00:09:47,279
he said um

268
00:09:47,279 --> 00:09:49,839
do you want to try sharing it and if i

269
00:09:49,839 --> 00:09:52,399
just remove it from there and

270
00:09:52,399 --> 00:09:55,519
unshare and reach it

271
00:09:55,519 --> 00:09:57,519
otherwise we may well just have to

272
00:09:57,519 --> 00:10:01,080
accept it but

273
00:10:03,120 --> 00:10:04,880
um

274
00:10:04,880 --> 00:10:08,560
try i tried resharing right now

275
00:10:11,760 --> 00:10:14,079
okay

276
00:10:15,120 --> 00:10:16,320
i'm not sure it's whether it's your

277
00:10:16,320 --> 00:10:20,560
connection or whether it's powerpoint or

278
00:10:21,279 --> 00:10:25,600
yeah it's still super slow updating

279
00:10:28,160 --> 00:10:30,560
yeah it's uh

280
00:10:30,560 --> 00:10:33,040
that's unfortunate um

281
00:10:33,040 --> 00:10:35,200
i'm trying to see where what my screen

282
00:10:35,200 --> 00:10:38,160
is showing right now uh in the presenter

283
00:10:38,160 --> 00:10:39,120
plane

284
00:10:39,120 --> 00:10:40,720
yeah it is really slow i can see that

285
00:10:40,720 --> 00:10:41,839
see

286
00:10:41,839 --> 00:10:44,839
um

287
00:10:47,120 --> 00:10:49,120
let me see if i could try something else

288
00:10:49,120 --> 00:10:50,960
really quickly here one second

289
00:10:50,960 --> 00:10:54,009
[Music]

290
00:10:54,240 --> 00:10:58,040
sorry about that um

291
00:11:15,760 --> 00:11:18,760
oh

292
00:11:32,480 --> 00:11:35,360
i'll try to share this lights

293
00:11:35,360 --> 00:11:36,240
um

294
00:11:36,240 --> 00:11:40,600
screaming already that will help

295
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:45,000
um

296
00:12:05,550 --> 00:12:08,689
[Music]

297
00:12:08,880 --> 00:12:11,440
it will not let me because of

298
00:12:11,440 --> 00:12:13,600
size is more than 50 megabytes that's

299
00:12:13,600 --> 00:12:16,240
unfortunate

300
00:12:16,399 --> 00:12:19,440
okay uh

301
00:12:20,320 --> 00:12:25,399
i'll try to see what i can do here

302
00:12:30,560 --> 00:12:32,160
so it did seem to work whenever

303
00:12:32,160 --> 00:12:33,519
something was updating so i don't know

304
00:12:33,519 --> 00:12:34,639
whether you can bring the terminal

305
00:12:34,639 --> 00:12:36,480
window up and just drag it around so it

306
00:12:36,480 --> 00:12:39,839
senses the refresh try that

307
00:12:39,920 --> 00:12:41,440
okay um

308
00:12:41,440 --> 00:12:44,079
yeah i think i'll just go

309
00:12:44,079 --> 00:12:46,240
yeah every time i change the slides

310
00:12:46,240 --> 00:12:50,000
for some reason it's very slow to update

311
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:53,000
um

312
00:12:53,440 --> 00:12:55,440
yeah

313
00:12:55,440 --> 00:12:57,520
not sure what's going on um

314
00:12:57,520 --> 00:12:59,279
[Music]

315
00:12:59,279 --> 00:13:03,240
try different screen maybe

316
00:13:22,079 --> 00:13:24,000
is that any better i

317
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:26,720
i'm not sure like is it

318
00:13:26,720 --> 00:13:30,880
is it updating better now uh

319
00:13:30,959 --> 00:13:34,199
than before

320
00:13:34,880 --> 00:13:36,800
yeah it seems to be a lot better um i

321
00:13:36,800 --> 00:13:39,600
don't want to be like the window

322
00:13:39,600 --> 00:13:42,560
okay um

323
00:13:42,560 --> 00:13:44,160
all right well

324
00:13:44,160 --> 00:13:45,440
i'll uh

325
00:13:45,440 --> 00:13:48,800
i'll say we'll be here well we can um so

326
00:13:48,800 --> 00:13:52,320
um i'll just uh start at this slide um

327
00:13:52,320 --> 00:13:54,560
uh i was saying posty and tracing work

328
00:13:54,560 --> 00:13:57,279
together um and then

329
00:13:57,279 --> 00:13:58,000
uh

330
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:00,079
just one of the producers that

331
00:14:00,079 --> 00:14:01,680
tracy

332
00:14:01,680 --> 00:14:03,040
tracy is just one of the producers i

333
00:14:03,040 --> 00:14:05,279
post you can use um

334
00:14:05,279 --> 00:14:07,920
tracy is powered by the pf it can

335
00:14:07,920 --> 00:14:10,240
generate events when it's his malicious

336
00:14:10,240 --> 00:14:13,360
behavior these events can be sent to

337
00:14:13,360 --> 00:14:16,880
um posty and then

338
00:14:16,880 --> 00:14:20,160
post you can act upon them um

339
00:14:20,160 --> 00:14:22,639
in in any way so for example

340
00:14:22,639 --> 00:14:24,639
if you tell posty to

341
00:14:24,639 --> 00:14:27,120
terminate any process that

342
00:14:27,120 --> 00:14:29,199
is malicious that is observed by tracy

343
00:14:29,199 --> 00:14:30,959
you can do that

344
00:14:30,959 --> 00:14:31,760
or

345
00:14:31,760 --> 00:14:33,760
you know other things as well

346
00:14:33,760 --> 00:14:34,639
um

347
00:14:34,639 --> 00:14:36,399
in the interest of time i'll skip over

348
00:14:36,399 --> 00:14:37,519
and

349
00:14:37,519 --> 00:14:40,079
talk about trivia and posty so trevi is

350
00:14:40,079 --> 00:14:42,720
a vulnerability scanner that can

351
00:14:42,720 --> 00:14:46,079
scan your images other artifacts um

352
00:14:46,079 --> 00:14:48,720
and then these reports that triggy and

353
00:14:48,720 --> 00:14:51,199
this outfit that trivia has can be

354
00:14:51,199 --> 00:14:54,480
uh sent to posty um and then post you

355
00:14:54,480 --> 00:14:56,560
can take actions like

356
00:14:56,560 --> 00:14:58,800
you know if the base image is vulnerable

357
00:14:58,800 --> 00:15:00,800
it can update that um

358
00:15:00,800 --> 00:15:02,720
if you want to remove that image

359
00:15:02,720 --> 00:15:04,560
altogether from your cluster you can do

360
00:15:04,560 --> 00:15:06,720
that as well so essentially it's

361
00:15:06,720 --> 00:15:10,079
it's all in your hands um what actions

362
00:15:10,079 --> 00:15:12,319
um

363
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:16,560
so this is where you know the automation

364
00:15:16,560 --> 00:15:21,040
piece um uh happens uh for

365
00:15:21,040 --> 00:15:23,760
for posty so um if there's thing if

366
00:15:23,760 --> 00:15:25,680
there are things that um you know happen

367
00:15:25,680 --> 00:15:28,320
very often like for example you think

368
00:15:28,320 --> 00:15:29,759
that you scan

369
00:15:29,759 --> 00:15:31,360
images often

370
00:15:31,360 --> 00:15:31,780
um

371
00:15:31,780 --> 00:15:32,959
[Music]

372
00:15:32,959 --> 00:15:34,560
and then you expect them to be

373
00:15:34,560 --> 00:15:35,600
vulnerable

374
00:15:35,600 --> 00:15:37,199
you know as vulnerabilities happen over

375
00:15:37,199 --> 00:15:39,600
time one common action could be you know

376
00:15:39,600 --> 00:15:42,079
update that image that is vulnerable

377
00:15:42,079 --> 00:15:43,440
um or

378
00:15:43,440 --> 00:15:45,519
you know issue a jar ticket for for

379
00:15:45,519 --> 00:15:48,160
instance um we have several integrations

380
00:15:48,160 --> 00:15:50,800
for posty that come out of the box

381
00:15:50,800 --> 00:15:51,680
um

382
00:15:51,680 --> 00:15:55,120
for example sending messages in slack

383
00:15:55,120 --> 00:15:58,240
um or microsoft teams or creating a

384
00:15:58,240 --> 00:16:00,480
jared ticket

385
00:16:00,480 --> 00:16:02,880
or you know any web hook that might be

386
00:16:02,880 --> 00:16:05,279
listening um so some of those i was

387
00:16:05,279 --> 00:16:07,199
gonna demo um

388
00:16:07,199 --> 00:16:09,360
in in the in the slides today

389
00:16:09,360 --> 00:16:12,399
um of how you can basically um

390
00:16:12,399 --> 00:16:14,639
take an event create a jar ticket out of

391
00:16:14,639 --> 00:16:16,079
it so that the operator can come

392
00:16:16,079 --> 00:16:17,839
tomorrow morning and doesn't have to be

393
00:16:17,839 --> 00:16:19,839
open up in the night

394
00:16:19,839 --> 00:16:22,079
to to handle the alert so you know you

395
00:16:22,079 --> 00:16:24,320
can create a ticket they can come take a

396
00:16:24,320 --> 00:16:26,320
look at tomorrow morning and

397
00:16:26,320 --> 00:16:29,040
act appropriately so the scan results

398
00:16:29,040 --> 00:16:32,240
for instance can be sent as a content as

399
00:16:32,240 --> 00:16:34,720
the content of a jared ticket

400
00:16:34,720 --> 00:16:37,199
to jira and you know you can take a look

401
00:16:37,199 --> 00:16:37,920
at

402
00:16:37,920 --> 00:16:39,680
uh what happened when you were trying to

403
00:16:39,680 --> 00:16:40,800
scan that

404
00:16:40,800 --> 00:16:42,160
um

405
00:16:42,160 --> 00:16:43,120
so

406
00:16:43,120 --> 00:16:45,680
in the interest of time um

407
00:16:45,680 --> 00:16:47,839
let me just quickly check how much is

408
00:16:47,839 --> 00:16:49,759
left

409
00:16:49,759 --> 00:16:52,320
well i'm already past it so uh

410
00:16:52,320 --> 00:16:54,000
you know these projects that i mentioned

411
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:56,399
today are all open source um opposed to

412
00:16:56,399 --> 00:16:58,000
each facing trivia

413
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:00,639
uh we welcome your contributions um and

414
00:17:00,639 --> 00:17:03,199
we you know look forward to hearing from

415
00:17:03,199 --> 00:17:04,880
you if you have any

416
00:17:04,880 --> 00:17:06,400
ideas or

417
00:17:06,400 --> 00:17:08,319
if there are integrations that you like

418
00:17:08,319 --> 00:17:11,119
to build um as i mentioned postie

419
00:17:11,119 --> 00:17:12,240
works with

420
00:17:12,240 --> 00:17:14,720
anything any producer um it just listens

421
00:17:14,720 --> 00:17:16,720
on a web book so

422
00:17:16,720 --> 00:17:19,439
anything that any producer wants to send

423
00:17:19,439 --> 00:17:20,799
here they can handle

424
00:17:20,799 --> 00:17:23,839
um and that's about it um thank you for

425
