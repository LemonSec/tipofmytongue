00:00:19,920 --> 00:00:22,080
infrastructure in the cloud

10
00:00:22,080 --> 00:00:23,760

based over in europe um disclose more

38
00:01:17,360 --> 00:01:19,119
information on that in a moment uh but

39
00:01:19,119 --> 00:01:20,799
this talk is about threat modeling

40
00:01:20,799 --> 00:01:23,360
kubernetes at light speed

41
00:01:23,360 --> 00:01:25,439
um that might be a lie but we will

42
00:01:25,439 --> 00:01:28,000
figure it out now um if you want to get

43
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:30,240

but yes

46
00:01:35,040 --> 00:01:37,439
i work for this company called control

47
00:01:37,439 --> 00:01:40,960
plane and so we do dev set ups um

48
00:01:40,960 --> 00:01:43,040
we just like security we like tough

49
00:01:43,040 --> 00:01:45,439
problems to solve so if you're doing

50
00:01:45,439 --> 00:01:46,960
anything in the cloud and you want to be

51
00:01:46,960 --> 00:01:49,040
more secure and you've got some problems

52
00:01:49,040 --> 00:01:51,360
then please feel free to reach out to us

53
00:01:51,360 --> 00:01:52,240
um

54
00:01:52,240 --> 00:01:55,520
we just love solving difficult issues

55
00:01:55,520 --> 00:01:58,320
now whilst i do have your attention um

56
00:01:58,320 --> 00:02:00,640
one of my favorite speakers he likes to

57
00:02:00,640 --> 00:02:02,159
draw attention to

58
00:02:02,159 --> 00:02:04,159
other issues outside of what we're

59
00:02:04,159 --> 00:02:05,840
talking about today so i'm just going to

60
00:02:05,840 --> 00:02:07,360
take a moment of your time just to talk

61
00:02:07,360 --> 00:02:08,800
about mental health

62
00:02:08,800 --> 00:02:11,520
um i suffer from depression and i know

63
00:02:11,520 --> 00:02:14,319
i'm not the only one who does

64
00:02:14,319 --> 00:02:15,840
this talk that you're about to hear

65
00:02:15,840 --> 00:02:17,680
today is all about standing up and

66
00:02:17,680 --> 00:02:20,080
having your voice heard um

67
00:02:20,080 --> 00:02:21,360
and so that's

68
00:02:21,360 --> 00:02:22,879
what i'd like just to pass on to at this

69
00:02:22,879 --> 00:02:25,040
moment your problems are your problems

70
00:02:25,040 --> 00:02:28,480
and they are valid um you are not alone

71
00:02:28,480 --> 00:02:30,560
if you do suffer from depression then

72
00:02:30,560 --> 00:02:32,080
please raise your voice make sure that

73
00:02:32,080 --> 00:02:33,920
other people know because you're awesome

74
00:02:33,920 --> 00:02:36,800
and fantastic

75
00:02:36,800 --> 00:02:39,200
now the other mitigation for this talk

76
00:02:39,200 --> 00:02:41,920
is that i am always learning um and i'm

77
00:02:41,920 --> 00:02:43,519
really happy with that

78
00:02:43,519 --> 00:02:45,040
maybe my role of head of training

79
00:02:45,040 --> 00:02:47,360
probably alludes to that at points

80
00:02:47,360 --> 00:02:50,319
the terms that i use of what i know of

81
00:02:50,319 --> 00:02:52,239
and i appreciate the time and effort

82
00:02:52,239 --> 00:02:53,920
that it takes to write maintain and

83
00:02:53,920 --> 00:02:55,920
contribute to open source so any

84
00:02:55,920 --> 00:02:57,920
terminology that i use during this talk

85
00:02:57,920 --> 00:03:00,080
today might feel aggressive because we

86
00:03:00,080 --> 00:03:02,480
are dealing with bad things happening

87
00:03:02,480 --> 00:03:04,800
if i do offend you in any way please

88
00:03:04,800 --> 00:03:06,640
feel free to reach out to me and so that

89
00:03:06,640 --> 00:03:09,679
i can continue to learn

90
00:03:09,840 --> 00:03:11,840
but let's get into this now what is

91
00:03:11,840 --> 00:03:13,599
threat modeling so fret modeling is

92
00:03:13,599 --> 00:03:15,599
identifying and enumerating threats and

93
00:03:15,599 --> 00:03:17,360
vulnerabilities with devising

94
00:03:17,360 --> 00:03:19,360
mitigations and we're prioritizing

95
00:03:19,360 --> 00:03:21,200
residual risks and we're escalating

96
00:03:21,200 --> 00:03:23,920
through the most important risks

97
00:03:23,920 --> 00:03:25,680
you should try to build the first fret

98
00:03:25,680 --> 00:03:26,959
the first version of fret modeling

99
00:03:26,959 --> 00:03:29,120
without outside influence then you can

100
00:03:29,120 --> 00:03:31,200
pull in external sources to cross check

101
00:03:31,200 --> 00:03:32,879
for groups thinking

102
00:03:32,879 --> 00:03:35,120
fret modeling can be performed at any

103
00:03:35,120 --> 00:03:37,200
stage of a project but to cope with

104
00:03:37,200 --> 00:03:39,840
smith's how soon is now the earlier you

105
00:03:39,840 --> 00:03:41,840
start the better it will be

106
00:03:41,840 --> 00:03:44,480
and this isn't a shift left

107
00:03:44,480 --> 00:03:46,560
from to someone else from the security

108
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:47,519
team

109
00:03:47,519 --> 00:03:49,360
this is about being for me a decent

110
00:03:49,360 --> 00:03:51,120
human being and respecting other

111
00:03:51,120 --> 00:03:53,120
people's information and lives but we'll

112
00:03:53,120 --> 00:03:56,879
discuss more about that during the talk

113
00:03:56,959 --> 00:03:59,040
now diversity uh for frat modeling we

114
00:03:59,040 --> 00:04:01,120
need everyone involved so raise gender

115
00:04:01,120 --> 00:04:03,519
age all shapes and sizes everyone should

116
00:04:03,519 --> 00:04:04,959
be involved with threat modeling

117
00:04:04,959 --> 00:04:08,319
absolutely everyone um from development

118
00:04:08,319 --> 00:04:11,040
operations qa product business

119
00:04:11,040 --> 00:04:12,959
stakeholders security

120
00:04:12,959 --> 00:04:14,720
even about where you work if you're back

121
00:04:14,720 --> 00:04:17,120
into an office then pro you might want

122
00:04:17,120 --> 00:04:19,120
to potentially speak to people who are

123
00:04:19,120 --> 00:04:20,560
at the front desk or people who are

124
00:04:20,560 --> 00:04:22,639
serving you food because all these

125
00:04:22,639 --> 00:04:24,639
people are part of this process that

126
00:04:24,639 --> 00:04:28,600
keeps the product moving

127
00:04:28,880 --> 00:04:29,759
now

128
00:04:29,759 --> 00:04:33,440
i also help out in ctfs at kubecon um

129
00:04:33,440 --> 00:04:36,240
for security days um i didn't

130
00:04:36,240 --> 00:04:37,759
i can't really remember saying this

131
00:04:37,759 --> 00:04:39,440
quote um and i don't really know where

132
00:04:39,440 --> 00:04:40,880
it came from

133
00:04:40,880 --> 00:04:42,639
but my point is is that i felt

134
00:04:42,639 --> 00:04:44,000
comfortable to share this whilst i was

135
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:46,000
on stage and this alludes to imposter

136
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:48,240
syndrome um i see the best in everyone

137
00:04:48,240 --> 00:04:49,840
else but i don't really think too much

138
00:04:49,840 --> 00:04:51,840
about myself at times

139
00:04:51,840 --> 00:04:53,360
i think that i'm not the only one who

140
00:04:53,360 --> 00:04:55,280
feels like that as an industry we focus

141
00:04:55,280 --> 00:04:56,639
on what we don't know rather than what

142
00:04:56,639 --> 00:04:58,240
we do know

143
00:04:58,240 --> 00:05:00,160
now ian is someone who i have the utmost

144
00:05:00,160 --> 00:05:02,240
respect for and

145
00:05:02,240 --> 00:05:04,320
ian gives me insane stuff like this

146
00:05:04,320 --> 00:05:05,840
gives me the confidence to be here to

147
00:05:05,840 --> 00:05:07,520
stand in front of you today

148
00:05:07,520 --> 00:05:09,280
so make sure that you're more like ian

149
00:05:09,280 --> 00:05:10,479
and make sure that you can empower

150
00:05:10,479 --> 00:05:11,919
others to make sure that they feel

151
00:05:11,919 --> 00:05:13,199
comfortable in sharing what their

152
00:05:13,199 --> 00:05:15,120
opinions are so that their voice can be

153
00:05:15,120 --> 00:05:17,360
heard

154
00:05:17,840 --> 00:05:19,759
now how to fret model we're going to go

155
00:05:19,759 --> 00:05:21,280
through these four steps throughout this

156
00:05:21,280 --> 00:05:22,320
talk today

157
00:05:22,320 --> 00:05:24,479
what are we building what can go wrong

158
00:05:24,479 --> 00:05:25,840
once it's built

159
00:05:25,840 --> 00:05:27,759
what are we going to do about the things

160
00:05:27,759 --> 00:05:29,680
that can go wrong and are we doing a

161
00:05:29,680 --> 00:05:31,120
good job

162
00:05:31,120 --> 00:05:33,440
at this stage have a think about why not

163
00:05:33,440 --> 00:05:35,600
run this threat modeling workshop at

164
00:05:35,600 --> 00:05:38,560
your own at your own pace let's get you

165
00:05:38,560 --> 00:05:40,000
into a position where you can talk of

166
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:41,280
confidence to be able to run this

167
00:05:41,280 --> 00:05:43,360
workshop

168
00:05:43,360 --> 00:05:45,120
so back to our points

169
00:05:45,120 --> 00:05:48,639
wtf are we building here um we have an

170
00:05:48,639 --> 00:05:50,639
assumption here on this talk that you've

171
00:05:50,639 --> 00:05:52,320
got a bit of an understanding as to

172
00:05:52,320 --> 00:05:54,160
kubernetes we're going to be more

173
00:05:54,160 --> 00:05:56,000
focused towards threat modeling aspect

174
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:57,280
um

175
00:05:57,280 --> 00:05:59,280
if you do have questions again i'll

176
00:05:59,280 --> 00:06:00,479
share my twitter handle at the end

177
00:06:00,479 --> 00:06:01,919
please feel free to drop me a message

178
00:06:01,919 --> 00:06:03,840
it's my day job but equally i love

179
00:06:03,840 --> 00:06:07,239
helping others

180
00:06:07,759 --> 00:06:10,160
so your business the

181
00:06:10,160 --> 00:06:12,880
way you work is not my business unless i

182
00:06:12,880 --> 00:06:14,800
do work with you but let's leave that

183
00:06:14,800 --> 00:06:17,120
my point here is is that all businesses

184
00:06:17,120 --> 00:06:18,880
are again different shapes and sizes you

185
00:06:18,880 --> 00:06:20,080
might be working for a large

186
00:06:20,080 --> 00:06:22,400
multinational corporation that's existed

187
00:06:22,400 --> 00:06:25,199
since some would say the dawn of time

188
00:06:25,199 --> 00:06:26,800
and some other people in this uh

189
00:06:26,800 --> 00:06:28,639
conference today they might have created

190
00:06:28,639 --> 00:06:31,120
their startup this morning um

191
00:06:31,120 --> 00:06:32,319
and now you're just trying to figure out

192
00:06:32,319 --> 00:06:34,479
the product that you need to launch

193
00:06:34,479 --> 00:06:35,280
now

194
00:06:35,280 --> 00:06:37,600
that's not all businesses are the shape

195
00:06:37,600 --> 00:06:39,840
and size and and this is also the same

196
00:06:39,840 --> 00:06:41,360
for your adversary so we're going to

197
00:06:41,360 --> 00:06:42,960
have a look at different types of

198
00:06:42,960 --> 00:06:45,680
adversaries that we might have

199
00:06:45,680 --> 00:06:46,960
later

200
00:06:46,960 --> 00:06:49,919
in the talk but what type of damage can

201
00:06:49,919 --> 00:06:51,599
be inflicted so we could have

202
00:06:51,599 --> 00:06:54,240
reputational damage or financial loss

203
00:06:54,240 --> 00:06:55,919
threats represent potential ways for

204
00:06:55,919 --> 00:06:58,160
information information assets can be

205
00:06:58,160 --> 00:06:59,360
attacked

206
00:06:59,360 --> 00:07:01,120
let's use an example of an information

207
00:07:01,120 --> 00:07:04,000
outset so is anyone watching this talk

208
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:06,400
right now are you willing to uh send me

209
00:07:06,400 --> 00:07:08,319
your credit card number and potentially

210
00:07:08,319 --> 00:07:11,840
cvv number in the chat

211
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:13,440
hopefully you don't

212
00:07:13,440 --> 00:07:15,840
but um and i hope that's because you

213
00:07:15,840 --> 00:07:17,520
don't feel comfortable to do so and you

214
00:07:17,520 --> 00:07:19,280
don't want to share that information

215
00:07:19,280 --> 00:07:21,039
equally um i've got some post-it notes

216
00:07:21,039 --> 00:07:22,160
here

217
00:07:22,160 --> 00:07:24,160
so this is my database um so if you do

218
00:07:24,160 --> 00:07:26,560
send me your credit card then i will

219
00:07:26,560 --> 00:07:28,400
store it here and again i really hope at

220
00:07:28,400 --> 00:07:29,759
this stage no one is sending me for

221
00:07:29,759 --> 00:07:33,039
credit card details if you are

222
00:07:33,039 --> 00:07:35,199
we'll figure that problem afterwards

223
00:07:35,199 --> 00:07:37,520
now in either case frets can exist which

224
00:07:37,520 --> 00:07:39,440
if realized could compromise one or more

225
00:07:39,440 --> 00:07:41,039
of the following key priorities of the

226
00:07:41,039 --> 00:07:44,319
data so we've got confidentiality so if

227
00:07:44,319 --> 00:07:45,759
i got access to your credit card and

228
00:07:45,759 --> 00:07:48,080
your cvd that server credit card number

229
00:07:48,080 --> 00:07:50,639
then i've got access to some information

230
00:07:50,639 --> 00:07:53,120
integrity so

231
00:07:53,120 --> 00:07:55,440
if i want to pay say let's talk about

232
00:07:55,440 --> 00:07:58,080
james say i want to pay james five

233
00:07:58,080 --> 00:08:00,720
pounds um but if andy modifies the

234
00:08:00,720 --> 00:08:03,520
request that i send then andy might

235
00:08:03,520 --> 00:08:04,560
receive

236
00:08:04,560 --> 00:08:05,919
that ten pounds

237
00:08:05,919 --> 00:08:07,840
that's an issue with our integrity

238
00:08:07,840 --> 00:08:10,080
finally we have availability so am i

239
00:08:10,080 --> 00:08:11,919
available to complete this transaction

240
00:08:11,919 --> 00:08:16,318
can i actually send this request across

241
00:08:17,599 --> 00:08:20,479
now back to our case studies um

242
00:08:20,479 --> 00:08:21,840
there should be a scheme in place for

243
00:08:21,840 --> 00:08:24,560
how important the information is so

244
00:08:24,560 --> 00:08:26,479
how much money is your business willing

245
00:08:26,479 --> 00:08:28,560
to lose so let's put a figure on that

246
00:08:28,560 --> 00:08:30,479
man let's say four hundred thousand and

247
00:08:30,479 --> 00:08:31,919
we'll use dollars as we're now in the

248
00:08:31,919 --> 00:08:33,519
american time zone

249
00:08:33,519 --> 00:08:34,719
um

250
00:08:34,719 --> 00:08:36,000
if you're a startup if you've just

251
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:37,599
started up your business today and

252
00:08:37,599 --> 00:08:40,080
you're counting the pennies then four

253
00:08:40,080 --> 00:08:42,799
thousand dollars is a lot four hundred

254
00:08:42,799 --> 00:08:44,640
thousand dollars in stanley is a lot of

255
00:08:44,640 --> 00:08:46,399
money and that's a risk that you might

256
00:08:46,399 --> 00:08:48,160
not be able to afford

257
00:08:48,160 --> 00:08:49,519
whereas if you're a multinational

258
00:08:49,519 --> 00:08:51,440
company then that could be

259
00:08:51,440 --> 00:08:53,760
cheaper essentially than fixing a

260
00:08:53,760 --> 00:08:55,519
problem

261
00:08:55,519 --> 00:08:57,040
but let's look at it from a different

262
00:08:57,040 --> 00:08:58,640
perspective now so instead of talking

263
00:08:58,640 --> 00:09:01,680
about money let's talk about data so how

264
00:09:01,680 --> 00:09:04,399
much customer data could you lose

265
00:09:04,399 --> 00:09:06,080
so let's say the customer data in this

266
00:09:06,080 --> 00:09:08,399
instance is the name the postal address

267
00:09:08,399 --> 00:09:11,200
and a personal contact number

268
00:09:11,200 --> 00:09:12,959
now if you have a startup again then you

269
00:09:12,959 --> 00:09:14,399
might say to yourself well actually

270
00:09:14,399 --> 00:09:16,320
we've our customer base is

271
00:09:16,320 --> 00:09:18,080
potentially just our family and some

272
00:09:18,080 --> 00:09:20,800
close friends

273
00:09:20,959 --> 00:09:22,640
it's a risk what i guess we're willing

274
00:09:22,640 --> 00:09:23,680
to take

275
00:09:23,680 --> 00:09:25,519
whereas if you're a multinational bank

276
00:09:25,519 --> 00:09:28,240
for instance and it's uh associated with

277
00:09:28,240 --> 00:09:30,080
people's life savings

278
00:09:30,080 --> 00:09:31,760
all of a sudden that name address and

279
00:09:31,760 --> 00:09:33,200
personal mobile number if that

280
00:09:33,200 --> 00:09:34,640
information gets out into the public

281
00:09:34,640 --> 00:09:37,360
then that is a huge cost from reputation

282
00:09:37,360 --> 00:09:39,040
from fines

283
00:09:39,040 --> 00:09:41,120
everything else

284
00:09:41,120 --> 00:09:42,480
so

285
00:09:42,480 --> 00:09:43,920
i guess that's almost like a joke to an

286
00:09:43,920 --> 00:09:45,279
extent because i don't think that would

287
00:09:45,279 --> 00:09:47,519
happen but there's also a serious aspect

288
00:09:47,519 --> 00:09:50,240
of this and that is loss of life so what

289
00:09:50,240 --> 00:09:52,080
happens when a secret needs to be a

290
00:09:52,080 --> 00:09:53,120
secret

291
00:09:53,120 --> 00:09:55,120
so you might have personal life choices

292
00:09:55,120 --> 00:09:57,600
and they might not be aligned with safer

293
00:09:57,600 --> 00:09:59,920
politics where you live or other

294
00:09:59,920 --> 00:10:02,160
religious people around you what happens

295
00:10:02,160 --> 00:10:03,600
if someone finds out that personal

296
00:10:03,600 --> 00:10:04,800
identifying

297
00:10:04,800 --> 00:10:06,079
personal information that you thought

298
00:10:06,079 --> 00:10:08,399
was secret what happens if they find out

299
00:10:08,399 --> 00:10:10,640
and also military what happens if

300
00:10:10,640 --> 00:10:13,040
someone's identified as being somewhere

301
00:10:13,040 --> 00:10:14,320
because they're running around the track

302
00:10:14,320 --> 00:10:15,600
and they're keeping

303
00:10:15,600 --> 00:10:17,040
like on their track time says and

304
00:10:17,040 --> 00:10:19,040
sharing with others

305
00:10:19,040 --> 00:10:20,640
and this isn't just down to the person

306
00:10:20,640 --> 00:10:22,720
in this instance either this is also by

307
00:10:22,720 --> 00:10:24,959
the people around them as well it's

308
00:10:24,959 --> 00:10:27,120
quite quick and easy to find information

309
00:10:27,120 --> 00:10:29,279
on people so if they can be identified

310
00:10:29,279 --> 00:10:31,279
and other people around them then this

311
00:10:31,279 --> 00:10:32,720
could all go wrong so i hope i have your

312
00:10:32,720 --> 00:10:34,000
attention when i say that this

313
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:37,760
information is really important to us

314
00:10:37,760 --> 00:10:39,279
now let's have a look at our adversary

315
00:10:39,279 --> 00:10:40,959
matrix here so we're going to start in

316
00:10:40,959 --> 00:10:42,160
the top left and we're going to look at

317
00:10:42,160 --> 00:10:44,560
a vandal now a vandal is someone that i

318
00:10:44,560 --> 00:10:45,920
would say

319
00:10:45,920 --> 00:10:47,680
does a little bit of this for fun um

320
00:10:47,680 --> 00:10:50,320
they look at youtube videos um i guess

321
00:10:50,320 --> 00:10:51,360
they don't think they're breaking the

322
00:10:51,360 --> 00:10:53,600
world it might be like

323
00:10:53,600 --> 00:10:54,560
back at school you might have been

324
00:10:54,560 --> 00:10:56,000
looking at running quake or counter

325
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:58,240
strike on your school network

326
00:10:58,240 --> 00:11:02,480
that to me is a script kitty um

327
00:11:02,480 --> 00:11:03,360
now

328
00:11:03,360 --> 00:11:05,279
you going on from script cody you might

329
00:11:05,279 --> 00:11:07,519
have a motivated individual

330
00:11:07,519 --> 00:11:10,320
so who is a motivated individual well if

331
00:11:10,320 --> 00:11:11,760
you're doing a startup they might be a

332
00:11:11,760 --> 00:11:12,839
competing

333
00:11:12,839 --> 00:11:15,120
starter um this might be someone who's

334
00:11:15,120 --> 00:11:17,519
taken a

335
00:11:17,519 --> 00:11:19,680
just doesn't play doesn't like you this

336
00:11:19,680 --> 00:11:21,040
could be so this could be someone that

337
00:11:21,040 --> 00:11:23,040
you came and said hi to you but you

338
00:11:23,040 --> 00:11:24,320
didn't recognize them and they've taken

339
00:11:24,320 --> 00:11:26,320
it personally they might be motivated in

340
00:11:26,320 --> 00:11:28,959
a way that they want to just uh

341
00:11:28,959 --> 00:11:30,320
either take down your website for a

342
00:11:30,320 --> 00:11:33,120
moment or just make you look bad

343
00:11:33,120 --> 00:11:35,120
now with such terrible things to say i

344
00:11:35,120 --> 00:11:36,720
would like to introduce you to freddie

345
00:11:36,720 --> 00:11:40,160
and freddie is an amazing amazing person

346
00:11:40,160 --> 00:11:41,360
um

347
00:11:41,360 --> 00:11:43,440
they recently came up to where i'm based

348
00:11:43,440 --> 00:11:46,000
i'm a chapter leader um and they gave a

349
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:47,600
walk through about hack the box and how

350
00:11:47,600 --> 00:11:48,880
they do it

351
00:11:48,880 --> 00:11:50,560
if you're interested in learning more

352
00:11:50,560 --> 00:11:52,720
about these techniques about how you can

353
00:11:52,720 --> 00:11:54,639
breach um from that perspective then

354
00:11:54,639 --> 00:11:56,240
this is someone i definitely recommend

355
00:11:56,240 --> 00:11:58,959
that you follow

356
00:11:59,600 --> 00:12:00,800
now moving on from a motivated

357
00:12:00,800 --> 00:12:02,639
individual let's look at insiders so a

358
00:12:02,639 --> 00:12:04,959
motivated individual potentially i'm

359
00:12:04,959 --> 00:12:06,240
thinking that they're outside of our

360
00:12:06,240 --> 00:12:08,480
organization now what happens if they're

361
00:12:08,480 --> 00:12:12,240
inside your organization well

362
00:12:12,240 --> 00:12:14,480
bad things potentially i probably prefer

363
00:12:14,480 --> 00:12:15,600
them to the outside but anyway it

364
00:12:15,600 --> 00:12:17,360
doesn't matter um

365
00:12:17,360 --> 00:12:19,600
it's not great but that's where we go

366
00:12:19,600 --> 00:12:22,560
we can't control other people um and how

367
00:12:22,560 --> 00:12:24,320
they feel so this might be someone who's

368
00:12:24,320 --> 00:12:25,839
disgruntled maybe they've seen some

369
00:12:25,839 --> 00:12:27,200
information to say that they're actually

370
00:12:27,200 --> 00:12:29,839
earning 20 less than everyone else on

371
00:12:29,839 --> 00:12:31,440
the same job or something so all of a

372
00:12:31,440 --> 00:12:33,200
sudden they've got a reason to feel a

373
00:12:33,200 --> 00:12:35,279
bit hard done by by the business

374
00:12:35,279 --> 00:12:38,639
um they could also be manipulated um

375
00:12:38,639 --> 00:12:40,560
and again we'll look into deeper

376
00:12:40,560 --> 00:12:42,720
why people might get manipulated but

377
00:12:42,720 --> 00:12:44,160
equally think about over the last couple

378
00:12:44,160 --> 00:12:46,079
of years think why we got these visual

379
00:12:46,079 --> 00:12:48,480
conferences with covid during covet lots

380
00:12:48,480 --> 00:12:50,160
of people use the internet as a way to

381
00:12:50,160 --> 00:12:52,160
be able to connect to networks and share

382
00:12:52,160 --> 00:12:54,480
personal information again and in places

383
00:12:54,480 --> 00:12:57,680
where they deemed to have trust

384
00:12:57,680 --> 00:12:59,519
this information could also manipulate

385
00:12:59,519 --> 00:13:01,279
people and that's what leads me onto the

386
00:13:01,279 --> 00:13:04,320
next part about being organized crime

387
00:13:04,320 --> 00:13:06,880
so how can people be manipulated well um

388
00:13:06,880 --> 00:13:08,560
it could be physical violence it could

389
00:13:08,560 --> 00:13:10,160
literally be that

390
00:13:10,160 --> 00:13:11,600
something's bad is going to happen if

391
00:13:11,600 --> 00:13:13,040
you don't do this for me

392
00:13:13,040 --> 00:13:14,880
and that is very much a hollywood kind

393
00:13:14,880 --> 00:13:17,200
of thought but the one that

394
00:13:17,200 --> 00:13:19,680
i think is a lot harder to deal with is

395
00:13:19,680 --> 00:13:22,240
to say well what happens if say that

396
00:13:22,240 --> 00:13:24,000
there's a gofundme page that you put in

397
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:25,600
place for uh

398
00:13:25,600 --> 00:13:27,279
a sick relative and you're trying to

399
00:13:27,279 --> 00:13:29,360
raise some money for medical bills

400
00:13:29,360 --> 00:13:31,040
what happens if your organized crime

401
00:13:31,040 --> 00:13:33,600
person comes to you and says right you

402
00:13:33,600 --> 00:13:35,440
you need to have this amount i'll give

403
00:13:35,440 --> 00:13:38,160
you that if you give me access to this

404
00:13:38,160 --> 00:13:40,000
and we're very privileged to be able to

405
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:42,320
work in an industry where our salaries

406
00:13:42,320 --> 00:13:44,560
are quite good but then

407
00:13:44,560 --> 00:13:46,720
what happens if if it's at this moment

408
00:13:46,720 --> 00:13:48,240
in time where you feel comfortable but

409
00:13:48,240 --> 00:13:49,920
then all of a sudden you have to make

410
00:13:49,920 --> 00:13:51,360
this decision

411
00:13:51,360 --> 00:13:52,560
now

412
00:13:52,560 --> 00:13:54,880
and the other point to stress here is

413
00:13:54,880 --> 00:13:56,959
up until this point i've lived through

414
00:13:56,959 --> 00:13:59,040
either two or three recessions i don't

415
00:13:59,040 --> 00:14:00,800
know what's happening right now in the

416
00:14:00,800 --> 00:14:03,839
world um i've lived through a pandemic

417
00:14:03,839 --> 00:14:06,880
i've lived through a volcano that caused

418
00:14:06,880 --> 00:14:08,639
air travel to cease

419
00:14:08,639 --> 00:14:10,880
and i've also lived through leicester

420
00:14:10,880 --> 00:14:13,519
city winning the premier league

421
00:14:13,519 --> 00:14:15,519
none of these things i would expect to

422
00:14:15,519 --> 00:14:17,519
like i would ex maybe possibly one of

423
00:14:17,519 --> 00:14:19,279
these things i would expect to happen

424
00:14:19,279 --> 00:14:20,959
but not all of them

425
00:14:20,959 --> 00:14:22,480
so even though right now you might feel

426
00:14:22,480 --> 00:14:25,680
comfortable what happens in the future

427
00:14:25,680 --> 00:14:26,480
so

428
00:14:26,480 --> 00:14:28,320
i'd like to play a quick game here so

429
00:14:28,320 --> 00:14:29,279
i'm going to call this one the

430
00:14:29,279 --> 00:14:31,040
apprentice so

431
00:14:31,040 --> 00:14:32,560
close your eyes and think that you're at

432
00:14:32,560 --> 00:14:34,800
either a conference a gig or a sports

433
00:14:34,800 --> 00:14:37,600
event um in person

434
00:14:37,600 --> 00:14:39,519
now they could be 10 people 100 people

435
00:14:39,519 --> 00:14:41,680
thousand or a hundred thousand people

436
00:14:41,680 --> 00:14:43,519
and just look around you and now think

437
00:14:43,519 --> 00:14:45,519
of this as your organization as where

438
00:14:45,519 --> 00:14:47,760
you work

439
00:14:47,760 --> 00:14:49,440
so of all these people that work in the

440
00:14:49,440 --> 00:14:51,040
organization i'm just going to give a

441
00:14:51,040 --> 00:14:54,079
shout out to steve um steve if you could

442
00:14:54,079 --> 00:14:56,160
raise your hand in this flood of people

443
00:14:56,160 --> 00:14:58,560
um i sent you an email today steve um

444
00:14:58,560 --> 00:15:00,560
because i identified you as a c-level

445
00:15:00,560 --> 00:15:02,800
exec thanks to some website where we all

446
00:15:02,800 --> 00:15:04,399
share our careers

447
00:15:04,399 --> 00:15:06,240
i emailed you your password because i

448
00:15:06,240 --> 00:15:08,959
found your password um and not only did

449
00:15:08,959 --> 00:15:10,800
i find your password but i used it to

450
00:15:10,800 --> 00:15:12,720
access your machine and i've taken a

451
00:15:12,720 --> 00:15:14,720
webcam video view which

452
00:15:14,720 --> 00:15:15,839
i don't think it's going to win any

453
00:15:15,839 --> 00:15:17,600
oscars but i don't think you want anyone

454
00:15:17,600 --> 00:15:19,839
else to see your performance so this

455
00:15:19,839 --> 00:15:21,360
doesn't sound too good for steve right

456
00:15:21,360 --> 00:15:22,720
now and i'm just trying to manipulate

457
00:15:22,720 --> 00:15:24,480
steve on all the emotional levels just

458
00:15:24,480 --> 00:15:26,079
so that i can get steve to do what i

459
00:15:26,079 --> 00:15:28,560
want to do

460
00:15:28,959 --> 00:15:30,959
now this again this might cause you to

461
00:15:30,959 --> 00:15:32,320
be like well that's funny because we

462
00:15:32,320 --> 00:15:33,920
know that it's probably just from a

463
00:15:33,920 --> 00:15:36,079
security breach exactly like so this

464
00:15:36,079 --> 00:15:38,000
data might have been released from

465
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:40,000
elsewhere from another thing and they

466
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:41,440
just use the same password with that

467
00:15:41,440 --> 00:15:42,720
email address

468
00:15:42,720 --> 00:15:45,120
but it allows us to leverage um so it's

469
00:15:45,120 --> 00:15:46,560
important right here to educate your

470
00:15:46,560 --> 00:15:49,920
team um on security so show them have i

471
00:15:49,920 --> 00:15:51,680
been phoned explain to them about what

472
00:15:51,680 --> 00:15:54,639
happens when these things go okay

473
00:15:54,639 --> 00:15:56,320
look towards password managers so that

474
00:15:56,320 --> 00:15:57,680
they don't use the same password for

475
00:15:57,680 --> 00:15:59,680
absolutely everything on the internet

476
00:15:59,680 --> 00:16:01,680
but again give them the confidence that

477
00:16:01,680 --> 00:16:03,440
they can come to you that they don't

478
00:16:03,440 --> 00:16:04,800
need to have to be ashamed to come to

479
00:16:04,800 --> 00:16:06,079
you to say they think something's gone

480
00:16:06,079 --> 00:16:08,000
wrong

481
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:10,000
now back to our adversary matrix uh

482
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:11,600
let's have a look at the cloud service

483
00:16:11,600 --> 00:16:13,199
insider so

484
00:16:13,199 --> 00:16:14,880
when this isn't in your office anymore

485
00:16:14,880 --> 00:16:16,639
this isn't within your organization but

486
00:16:16,639 --> 00:16:17,839
thanks to the cloud we're renting

487
00:16:17,839 --> 00:16:20,240
someone else's computer but this uh

488
00:16:20,240 --> 00:16:22,160
computer does exist somewhere in the

489
00:16:22,160 --> 00:16:23,120
world

490
00:16:23,120 --> 00:16:25,199
um at a recent conference i was able to

491
00:16:25,199 --> 00:16:26,959
touch for cloud because they brought a

492
00:16:26,959 --> 00:16:29,759
cloud server with them

493
00:16:29,759 --> 00:16:31,040
how can you trust that person who's

494
00:16:31,040 --> 00:16:32,560
touching that cloud server how can you

495
00:16:32,560 --> 00:16:34,160
trust a person who's employed by a third

496
00:16:34,160 --> 00:16:36,000
party that you're dependent on to write

497
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:38,639
the code and that's all being signed and

498
00:16:38,639 --> 00:16:40,079
processed how do we know that it's been

499
00:16:40,079 --> 00:16:42,240
checked how do we know these things

500
00:16:42,240 --> 00:16:43,920
so that's also something else that we

501
00:16:43,920 --> 00:16:45,600
could

502
00:16:45,600 --> 00:16:47,440
have an issue with

503
00:16:47,440 --> 00:16:49,920
now going on to our final game of who's

504
00:16:49,920 --> 00:16:51,839
sat next to you anyway go back to

505
00:16:51,839 --> 00:16:53,600
wherever you were in your mind palace uh

506
00:16:53,600 --> 00:16:55,600
with all those people and now if you're

507
00:16:55,600 --> 00:16:57,519
looking in that direction look the other

508
00:16:57,519 --> 00:16:59,040
way and i think you'll be able to see

509
00:16:59,040 --> 00:17:01,040
sofia is sat next to you right now

510
00:17:01,040 --> 00:17:02,720
smiling back

511
00:17:02,720 --> 00:17:04,319
you do know that sofia works for a

512
00:17:04,319 --> 00:17:06,160
government agency with unlimited funds

513
00:17:06,160 --> 00:17:08,079
towards offensive security don't you and

514
00:17:08,079 --> 00:17:09,520
you also know that sophia isn't really

515
00:17:09,520 --> 00:17:10,480
her

516
00:17:10,480 --> 00:17:12,000
isn't their real name because that's an

517
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:13,839
identity that was produced by a

518
00:17:13,839 --> 00:17:15,359
government for them

519
00:17:15,359 --> 00:17:16,959
how do you manage that threat how do you

520
00:17:16,959 --> 00:17:18,559
manage it when you've got a government

521
00:17:18,559 --> 00:17:20,799
agency who has unlimited budget lots of

522
00:17:20,799 --> 00:17:22,720
time and resource depend uh to spend on

523
00:17:22,720 --> 00:17:24,959
new offensive techniques and um have

524
00:17:24,959 --> 00:17:27,119
access to undisclosed information prior

525
00:17:27,119 --> 00:17:29,360
to public knowledge

526
00:17:29,360 --> 00:17:31,200
so we're going to try and do our best in

527
00:17:31,200 --> 00:17:33,039
this so here is an example of a section

528
00:17:33,039 --> 00:17:34,559
of the data flow diagram that we are

529
00:17:34,559 --> 00:17:36,720
used that we use in our full workshop

530
00:17:36,720 --> 00:17:39,280
for fret modeling kubernetes a data flow

531
00:17:39,280 --> 00:17:41,200
diagram should describe the complete set

532
00:17:41,200 --> 00:17:43,840
of data the trust boundaries all user

533
00:17:43,840 --> 00:17:46,400
roles all network interfaces

534
00:17:46,400 --> 00:17:47,840
we should make it self-contained and

535
00:17:47,840 --> 00:17:49,520
most importantly here it should be

536
00:17:49,520 --> 00:17:51,360
accurate

537
00:17:51,360 --> 00:17:52,799
to make this easier for others to

538
00:17:52,799 --> 00:17:54,640
consume and contribute towards there can

539
00:17:54,640 --> 00:17:56,320
be many levels that drill down further

540
00:17:56,320 --> 00:17:58,400
into system components so in this

541
00:17:58,400 --> 00:17:59,919
instance remember to drop the ladder for

542
00:17:59,919 --> 00:18:03,120
others so they have the ability to climb

543
00:18:03,120 --> 00:18:05,120
now here's another example of the cncf

544
00:18:05,120 --> 00:18:07,200
financial services user group kubernetes

545
00:18:07,200 --> 00:18:09,280
data flow diagram the link is within the

546
00:18:09,280 --> 00:18:11,919
slide we've identified state flow with

547
00:18:11,919 --> 00:18:13,760
the black arrows and the black arrows

548
00:18:13,760 --> 00:18:15,520
are crossing a machine segregation

549
00:18:15,520 --> 00:18:17,280
between nodes as can be seen with the

550
00:18:17,280 --> 00:18:18,880
green boundaries

551
00:18:18,880 --> 00:18:20,320
there is a lot of information here but

552
00:18:20,320 --> 00:18:21,520
if you want to know more about these

553
00:18:21,520 --> 00:18:25,200
then please follow the link to the repo

554
00:18:25,520 --> 00:18:27,200
so how can attacker look for an entry

555
00:18:27,200 --> 00:18:29,760
point well publicly publicly available

556
00:18:29,760 --> 00:18:31,919
information is the easiest to root in

557
00:18:31,919 --> 00:18:34,000
now rory is someone again that i and

558
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:36,320
many of us look up to in the industry he

559
00:18:36,320 --> 00:18:38,400
has a fantastic blog post about finding

560
00:18:38,400 --> 00:18:40,400
publicly accessible clusters

561
00:18:40,400 --> 00:18:41,919
you might think to yourself why would

562
00:18:41,919 --> 00:18:43,360
someone want to have a publicly

563
00:18:43,360 --> 00:18:46,160
accessible cluster well um as you might

564
00:18:46,160 --> 00:18:47,919
have seen kubernetes is kind of a big

565
00:18:47,919 --> 00:18:49,280
thing at the moment and there's still

566
00:18:49,280 --> 00:18:50,640
people coming into this and still

567
00:18:50,640 --> 00:18:52,240
getting started in learning

568
00:18:52,240 --> 00:18:54,240
when i learn i usually make mistakes

569
00:18:54,240 --> 00:18:57,360
unknowingly um but that is how i learn

570
00:18:57,360 --> 00:18:59,440
and so on that basis this is why we need

571
00:18:59,440 --> 00:19:00,960
a fret model again this is why we need

572
00:19:00,960 --> 00:19:02,400
to try to figure out when we're putting

573
00:19:02,400 --> 00:19:04,080
fingers in place what is a fret

574
00:19:04,080 --> 00:19:06,960
associated with it

575
00:19:07,520 --> 00:19:10,160
so now we'll go on to what can uh so now

576
00:19:10,160 --> 00:19:11,600
that we know what we're building let's

577
00:19:11,600 --> 00:19:13,440
have a look at what can go wrong so for

578
00:19:13,440 --> 00:19:15,919
example the alignment of this header has

579
00:19:15,919 --> 00:19:18,400
gone wrong

580
00:19:18,400 --> 00:19:20,480
now this is where your experience is

581
00:19:20,480 --> 00:19:23,919
required has anyone have heard of a term

582
00:19:23,919 --> 00:19:25,200
uh

583
00:19:25,200 --> 00:19:27,600
have you ever used term secret source uh

584
00:19:27,600 --> 00:19:29,679
when building products

585
00:19:29,679 --> 00:19:31,280
what happens when someone else finds out

586
00:19:31,280 --> 00:19:33,200
about your secret source well it's no no

587
00:19:33,200 --> 00:19:35,200
longer secret anymore

588
00:19:35,200 --> 00:19:37,120
if something doesn't look or feel right

589
00:19:37,120 --> 00:19:39,679
now is the time to raise it we can also

590
00:19:39,679 --> 00:19:42,000
use fret intelligence sources such as

591
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:43,679
these listed here

592
00:19:43,679 --> 00:19:46,480
um and this is lots of people collating

593
00:19:46,480 --> 00:19:48,400
information to help us out

594
00:19:48,400 --> 00:19:49,200
and

595
00:19:49,200 --> 00:19:50,640
as associated with what i feel with

596
00:19:50,640 --> 00:19:53,440
cloud native um all these all these

597
00:19:53,440 --> 00:19:55,280
intelligent sources are us standing on

598
00:19:55,280 --> 00:19:56,880
the shoulders of giants

599
00:19:56,880 --> 00:19:58,559
so this is these techniques are our

600
00:19:58,559 --> 00:20:00,720
starting points and from there we use

601
00:20:00,720 --> 00:20:02,640
modeling techniques such as stride and

602
00:20:02,640 --> 00:20:04,960
attack trees to dive into our use case

603
00:20:04,960 --> 00:20:06,720
detail

604
00:20:06,720 --> 00:20:08,240
so let's just have a quick look of a

605
00:20:08,240 --> 00:20:10,400
microsoft threat matrix for kubernetes

606
00:20:10,400 --> 00:20:11,840
again we'll be touching on a few of

607
00:20:11,840 --> 00:20:13,120
these but the main thing that i would

608
00:20:13,120 --> 00:20:14,720
like you just to be aware of here is is

609
00:20:14,720 --> 00:20:16,720
that we got red and green

610
00:20:16,720 --> 00:20:18,799
red is a depreciated technique and green

611
00:20:18,799 --> 00:20:20,400
are new techniques

612
00:20:20,400 --> 00:20:22,320
kubernetes is constantly evolving and we

613
00:20:22,320 --> 00:20:25,600
need to evolve with it too

614
00:20:25,840 --> 00:20:27,200
so we're going to talk through the

615
00:20:27,200 --> 00:20:30,159
strike modeling technique now um i can

616
00:20:30,159 --> 00:20:31,840
never really remember what sorry it

617
00:20:31,840 --> 00:20:34,080
stands for off top my head i i should

618
00:20:34,080 --> 00:20:35,440
practice it more

619
00:20:35,440 --> 00:20:37,440
but what we what would we strive to

620
00:20:37,440 --> 00:20:39,440
destroy the process for data flows

621
00:20:39,440 --> 00:20:42,000
stores and actors and we want to know

622
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:44,240
what can go wrong

623
00:20:44,240 --> 00:20:46,960
so s stands for spoofing

624
00:20:46,960 --> 00:20:48,559
how do you actually know that i'm lewis

625
00:20:48,559 --> 00:20:49,679
how do you know that i don't have a

626
00:20:49,679 --> 00:20:51,360
green screen around me and that i'm not

627
00:20:51,360 --> 00:20:54,080
using like a snap filter on my face

628
00:20:54,080 --> 00:20:55,840
also one of my intentions in giving this

629
00:20:55,840 --> 00:20:57,440
talk to you what

630
00:20:57,440 --> 00:20:59,039
am i actually thinking about teaching

631
00:20:59,039 --> 00:21:00,240
you about fret modeling or am i just

632
00:21:00,240 --> 00:21:01,760
trying to push you into a direction to

633
00:21:01,760 --> 00:21:03,039
do something else

634
00:21:03,039 --> 00:21:04,960
but let's go to a banking for an example

635
00:21:04,960 --> 00:21:06,559
and say that you got access to someone's

636
00:21:06,559 --> 00:21:07,919
email address and you saw all the

637
00:21:07,919 --> 00:21:09,919
invoices that they sent out you wrote a

638
00:21:09,919 --> 00:21:11,600
little script and that so there's a

639
00:21:11,600 --> 00:21:13,280
reply to say sorry we just changed our

640
00:21:13,280 --> 00:21:14,880
bank account details to this please can

641
00:21:14,880 --> 00:21:17,440
you pay the invoice on this bank account

642
00:21:17,440 --> 00:21:19,120
if someone receives that email they

643
00:21:19,120 --> 00:21:21,520
don't know the difference

644
00:21:21,520 --> 00:21:23,760
tampering um

645
00:21:23,760 --> 00:21:26,000
who has access to what can we can

646
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:28,880
someone flip a bit um if i've got access

647
00:21:28,880 --> 00:21:30,559
to a banking system can i increase

648
00:21:30,559 --> 00:21:33,200
someone's credit um

649
00:21:33,200 --> 00:21:35,120
and equally um

650
00:21:35,120 --> 00:21:36,720
this we use this in an example a moment

651
00:21:36,720 --> 00:21:38,480
ago with james and andy where andy was

652
00:21:38,480 --> 00:21:40,400
able to change the amount of money that

653
00:21:40,400 --> 00:21:43,039
he was sending

654
00:21:43,039 --> 00:21:45,039
repudiation um

655
00:21:45,039 --> 00:21:46,000
this is

656
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:47,760
my word against your word who are you

657
00:21:47,760 --> 00:21:50,480
going to trust is our system logging uh

658
00:21:50,480 --> 00:21:52,880
suggesting that it's business as usual

659
00:21:52,880 --> 00:21:54,960
the modified request

660
00:21:54,960 --> 00:21:56,559
that we did in our banking example was

661
00:21:56,559 --> 00:21:58,480
done in transit and so if it's in

662
00:21:58,480 --> 00:22:00,880
transit how do we know that this request

663
00:22:00,880 --> 00:22:02,000
has been received and it hasn't been

664
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:03,520
manipulated

665
00:22:03,520 --> 00:22:04,960
from our point of view everything was

666
00:22:04,960 --> 00:22:06,960
fine and if we go back to the james and

667
00:22:06,960 --> 00:22:08,799
andy example well i'll ask andy but

668
00:22:08,799 --> 00:22:10,960
again how how can i trust andy um if

669
00:22:10,960 --> 00:22:12,880
angie says well no i didn't receive any

670
00:22:12,880 --> 00:22:15,919
funds how do i know that

671
00:22:15,919 --> 00:22:18,240
i is for information disclosure so does

672
00:22:18,240 --> 00:22:20,240
anyone want to put their credit card cv

673
00:22:20,240 --> 00:22:22,080
number in the chat no because you don't

674
00:22:22,080 --> 00:22:23,679
disclose that information

675
00:22:23,679 --> 00:22:24,480
um

676
00:22:24,480 --> 00:22:26,720
also just if if someone's left their

677
00:22:26,720 --> 00:22:28,320
mobile phone unlocked on the table next

678
00:22:28,320 --> 00:22:29,600
to you you could go through and have a

679
00:22:29,600 --> 00:22:30,960
look through so much of their

680
00:22:30,960 --> 00:22:32,720
information potentially or this could be

681
00:22:32,720 --> 00:22:34,320
to say like an s3 bucket so that's

682
00:22:34,320 --> 00:22:36,880
publicly available

683
00:22:36,880 --> 00:22:38,720
denial of service attack too much

684
00:22:38,720 --> 00:22:40,400
information to process too many

685
00:22:40,400 --> 00:22:42,320
questions all at once

686
00:22:42,320 --> 00:22:44,240
if we uh do a denial of service onto an

687
00:22:44,240 --> 00:22:46,559
api endpoint can the administrator get

688
00:22:46,559 --> 00:22:48,000
information back from a kubernetes

689
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:49,600
cluster as to actually what's running

690
00:22:49,600 --> 00:22:52,320
and what's happening

691
00:22:53,600 --> 00:22:54,880
so finally we got elevation and

692
00:22:54,880 --> 00:22:57,200
privilege how do we get to the backstage

693
00:22:57,200 --> 00:22:58,880
area do i just put on a different

694
00:22:58,880 --> 00:23:00,559
lanyard to be able to pretend to be

695
00:23:00,559 --> 00:23:01,679
something else

696
00:23:01,679 --> 00:23:03,120
um

697
00:23:03,120 --> 00:23:04,960
but then equally what if there's a

698
00:23:04,960 --> 00:23:06,640
service account that i use does it give

699
00:23:06,640 --> 00:23:08,720
me access to

700
00:23:08,720 --> 00:23:10,640
higher side privileges

701
00:23:10,640 --> 00:23:13,919
so we build from stride and we visualize

702
00:23:13,919 --> 00:23:16,400
with attack trees um

703
00:23:16,400 --> 00:23:18,400
attackers helps to identify risks to our

704
00:23:18,400 --> 00:23:19,760
resources and the likelihood of them

705
00:23:19,760 --> 00:23:21,520
happening

706
00:23:21,520 --> 00:23:22,720
we don't want to have too much

707
00:23:22,720 --> 00:23:24,880
information though so focus on quality

708
00:23:24,880 --> 00:23:27,039
not quantity at this stage and be

709
00:23:27,039 --> 00:23:28,720
confident in delivering concise

710
00:23:28,720 --> 00:23:30,880
documentation

711
00:23:30,880 --> 00:23:32,640
so we've put this example together of

712
00:23:32,640 --> 00:23:35,760
carrying a briefcase to a locker um

713
00:23:35,760 --> 00:23:38,400
the light green are all nodes so these

714
00:23:38,400 --> 00:23:40,320
are our options available to us uh the

715
00:23:40,320 --> 00:23:43,360
blue would be and nodes so or means that

716
00:23:43,360 --> 00:23:45,360
any other child elements and and means

717
00:23:45,360 --> 00:23:47,360
that both childs would have or all

718
00:23:47,360 --> 00:23:49,360
children would have to uh complete to be

719
00:23:49,360 --> 00:23:51,840
able to access

720
00:23:52,240 --> 00:23:54,159
now caddy shortridge has shown us how to

721
00:23:54,159 --> 00:23:56,080
use graphics to build attack trees

722
00:23:56,080 --> 00:23:58,320
deciduous is another option available to

723
00:23:58,320 --> 00:24:00,720
code an attack tree and we have also

724
00:24:00,720 --> 00:24:02,720
created an example available within this

725
00:24:02,720 --> 00:24:05,200
git repo

726
00:24:05,200 --> 00:24:06,480
so let's have a look at what can go

727
00:24:06,480 --> 00:24:08,240
wrong in kubernetes so i'm going to

728
00:24:08,240 --> 00:24:10,159
speed through this one now but try and

729
00:24:10,159 --> 00:24:12,960
name this cube kubernetes attack so

730
00:24:12,960 --> 00:24:15,039
looking at our wheel of misfortune what

731
00:24:15,039 --> 00:24:16,240
can go wrong

732
00:24:16,240 --> 00:24:20,000
so is there an r do i have an a

733
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:22,400
and do i have a c so at this point i'm

734
00:24:22,400 --> 00:24:23,760
going to guess our back miss

735
00:24:23,760 --> 00:24:25,520
configuration

736
00:24:25,520 --> 00:24:27,279
now you might have seen the problem here

737
00:24:27,279 --> 00:24:28,880
i didn't think about how long this

738
00:24:28,880 --> 00:24:30,799
configuration was when i started this

739
00:24:30,799 --> 00:24:32,960
but i fixed it now just by a

740
00:24:32,960 --> 00:24:35,760
misconfiguration on the end

741
00:24:35,760 --> 00:24:37,120
now

742
00:24:37,120 --> 00:24:38,559
that's one thing that can go wrong in

743
00:24:38,559 --> 00:24:40,159
kubernetes but there is lots that we can

744
00:24:40,159 --> 00:24:41,679
do so let's have a look at our workloads

745
00:24:41,679 --> 00:24:43,600
so our parts we could have an uh rights

746
00:24:43,600 --> 00:24:46,320
we could have a container breakout file

747
00:24:46,320 --> 00:24:48,960
systems host mounts hostile containers

748
00:24:48,960 --> 00:24:50,799
for container runtime itself the

749
00:24:50,799 --> 00:24:52,480
configuration of our pod

750
00:24:52,480 --> 00:24:54,159
the part security contacts and the

751
00:24:54,159 --> 00:24:57,120
service accounts associated with it

752
00:24:57,120 --> 00:24:59,279
with networking we might have intraparta

753
00:24:59,279 --> 00:25:02,320
issues we could have uh interpod issues

754
00:25:02,320 --> 00:25:03,600
again

755
00:25:03,600 --> 00:25:05,679
we have no workload identity by default

756
00:25:05,679 --> 00:25:09,600
and we have no network policy by default

757
00:25:09,679 --> 00:25:11,679
storage we could have attacking volumes

758
00:25:11,679 --> 00:25:13,919
um we have dangers of host mounts we

759
00:25:13,919 --> 00:25:15,760
could also have no encryption at rest so

760
00:25:15,760 --> 00:25:18,400
if we're using lcd well lcd being used

761
00:25:18,400 --> 00:25:19,919
by the control plane to store uh

762
00:25:19,919 --> 00:25:21,279
kubernetes state

763
00:25:21,279 --> 00:25:23,679
um also persistent storage to one run

764
00:25:23,679 --> 00:25:26,720
the state of our workloads

765
00:25:26,880 --> 00:25:30,320
i am so uh do we have a pivot to attack

766
00:25:30,320 --> 00:25:32,720
the cloud api or pivot to attack the

767
00:25:32,720 --> 00:25:35,120
kubernetes api or can we use i am to

768
00:25:35,120 --> 00:25:38,000
exploit app workflows

769
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:40,000
so in summary lots can go wrong but

770
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:42,000
don't be scared just take each day as it

771
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:44,080
comes and push forward make a start in

772
00:25:44,080 --> 00:25:47,520
it now and it will get better

773
00:25:47,840 --> 00:25:50,559
so this is only a small subsection of an

774
00:25:50,559 --> 00:25:52,799
attack tree for kubernetes um we can

775
00:25:52,799 --> 00:25:54,960
review these attacks to see how well

776
00:25:54,960 --> 00:25:56,960
they can be scoped do our attackers have

777
00:25:56,960 --> 00:25:58,640
access to resources that can enable

778
00:25:58,640 --> 00:25:59,600
these

779
00:25:59,600 --> 00:26:02,000
um this is available in stemi on the

780
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:04,640
same repo

781
00:26:05,200 --> 00:26:07,360
so now we know what can go wrong

782
00:26:07,360 --> 00:26:09,600
what are we going to do about it

783
00:26:09,600 --> 00:26:12,080
well we could do absolutely nothing and

784
00:26:12,080 --> 00:26:13,679
i joke but if we didn't complete the

785
00:26:13,679 --> 00:26:15,440
last step then you are doing absolutely

786
00:26:15,440 --> 00:26:17,279
nothing but in becoming aware of the

787
00:26:17,279 --> 00:26:19,120
risks you can determine your own threat

788
00:26:19,120 --> 00:26:20,720
model

789
00:26:20,720 --> 00:26:22,320
and we have all performed the personal

790
00:26:22,320 --> 00:26:24,480
threat model and during covert you have

791
00:26:24,480 --> 00:26:27,600
to make decisions as to are you

792
00:26:27,600 --> 00:26:29,120
all those decisions about staying in

793
00:26:29,120 --> 00:26:30,799
your house being away from others are

794
00:26:30,799 --> 00:26:32,080
you willing to travel are you going to

795
00:26:32,080 --> 00:26:33,360
do these things

796
00:26:33,360 --> 00:26:34,960
you've already threat modeled so when

797
00:26:34,960 --> 00:26:36,320
i'm talking about fret modeling now

798
00:26:36,320 --> 00:26:37,840
don't be scared of it you're already

799
00:26:37,840 --> 00:26:40,240
doing it

800
00:26:40,480 --> 00:26:42,080
so we have our shade responsibility

801
00:26:42,080 --> 00:26:43,600
model so this is a choice of where you

802
00:26:43,600 --> 00:26:45,919
run your cluster and the effects of your

803
00:26:45,919 --> 00:26:47,520
fret model so if you're running it as a

804
00:26:47,520 --> 00:26:49,039
hosted service when your provider is

805
00:26:49,039 --> 00:26:50,799
managing a number of controls if you're

806
00:26:50,799 --> 00:26:52,159
running your own data center then you're

807
00:26:52,159 --> 00:26:56,159
having to manage your control plane

808
00:26:56,320 --> 00:26:58,640
so with risk management um

809
00:26:58,640 --> 00:27:00,960
follow what marie kondo does and just

810
00:27:00,960 --> 00:27:03,679
marry conduit away if we can avoid it

811
00:27:03,679 --> 00:27:04,880
get it out

812
00:27:04,880 --> 00:27:06,480
if we can mitigate it then we can make

813
00:27:06,480 --> 00:27:08,400
this better and this brings us joy so we

814
00:27:08,400 --> 00:27:10,559
need to work harder for it we can also

815
00:27:10,559 --> 00:27:12,640
accept it which is just well yeah this

816
00:27:12,640 --> 00:27:14,880
isn't a this is this doesn't affect us

817
00:27:14,880 --> 00:27:16,559
finally we can transfer this so we could

818
00:27:16,559 --> 00:27:18,240
pass this to legal to deal with and i'm

819
00:27:18,240 --> 00:27:21,840
sure that that will bring them joy

820
00:27:22,159 --> 00:27:23,919
so we have our types of controls we have

821
00:27:23,919 --> 00:27:26,000
preventative so shifting knowledge left

822
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:28,480
empowering others to have a mindset and

823
00:27:28,480 --> 00:27:29,679
we could also look at tools like

824
00:27:29,679 --> 00:27:31,760
cubesack and opa to provide constructive

825
00:27:31,760 --> 00:27:34,240
feedback to people making changes

826
00:27:34,240 --> 00:27:36,640
detective so um we can export and

827
00:27:36,640 --> 00:27:38,720
monitor logs tools like silly mo falco

828
00:27:38,720 --> 00:27:41,360
or anything else um corrective something

829
00:27:41,360 --> 00:27:43,919
has been triggered by a log event

830
00:27:43,919 --> 00:27:45,840
um for example

831
00:27:45,840 --> 00:27:47,279
if you've got a big red button on your

832
00:27:47,279 --> 00:27:48,799
desk that when you hit it it just kills

833
00:27:48,799 --> 00:27:50,320
everything that can be your corrective

834
00:27:50,320 --> 00:27:52,240
measure just like pulling the the power

835
00:27:52,240 --> 00:27:54,159
cable out of the box

836
00:27:54,159 --> 00:27:56,880
and just be careful uh with your

837
00:27:56,880 --> 00:27:58,559
controls as well if you've got all

838
00:27:58,559 --> 00:28:00,000
school controls which aren't following

839
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:02,159
best practices nowadays such as our high

840
00:28:02,159 --> 00:28:04,159
availability

841
00:28:04,159 --> 00:28:05,760
highly available means being highly

842
00:28:05,760 --> 00:28:08,559
available so look towards githubs flux

843
00:28:08,559 --> 00:28:10,159
ci cd

844
00:28:10,159 --> 00:28:13,520
less manual and more automation

845
00:28:13,679 --> 00:28:15,840
kubernetes and cloud i am is at the

846
00:28:15,840 --> 00:28:18,000
center of cloud native security so re

847
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:19,679
review your permissions regularly use

848
00:28:19,679 --> 00:28:21,440
management processes user management

849
00:28:21,440 --> 00:28:23,840
processes are key review onboarding and

850
00:28:23,840 --> 00:28:25,600
off-boarding processes for joiners

851
00:28:25,600 --> 00:28:27,919
movers and levers or jml

852
00:28:27,919 --> 00:28:30,559
implement strong access control policies

853
00:28:30,559 --> 00:28:32,159
default kubernetes service accounts

854
00:28:32,159 --> 00:28:33,760
should not be used create a dedicated

855
00:28:33,760 --> 00:28:35,440
service account for every workload its

856
00:28:35,440 --> 00:28:37,679
own workload identity workloads will

857
00:28:37,679 --> 00:28:39,840
interact with kubernetes api over cloud

858
00:28:39,840 --> 00:28:42,000
via a workload identity integration

859
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:44,240
cloud provider services can help so i am

860
00:28:44,240 --> 00:28:46,320
rules for service accounts in aws or

861
00:28:46,320 --> 00:28:48,399
workload identity and gke

862
00:28:48,399 --> 00:28:50,960
the irsa uses service account token

863
00:28:50,960 --> 00:28:52,960
volume protections and this is just one

864
00:28:52,960 --> 00:28:55,360
benefit of using managed offering for

865
00:28:55,360 --> 00:28:57,679
topic for cryptography strong workload

866
00:28:57,679 --> 00:29:00,559
identities spire can be used spire is a

867
00:29:00,559 --> 00:29:02,080
production ready implementation of a

868
00:29:02,080 --> 00:29:05,039
spiffy's api

869
00:29:05,039 --> 00:29:06,880
focus towards least privileged parts

870
00:29:06,880 --> 00:29:08,960
make sure that we can't run things that

871
00:29:08,960 --> 00:29:10,559
we don't want to

872
00:29:10,559 --> 00:29:12,320
review what the workloads are being

873
00:29:12,320 --> 00:29:14,720
submitted to the api and use ids to

874
00:29:14,720 --> 00:29:16,880
report on suspicious behavior and

875
00:29:16,880 --> 00:29:18,960
automated securing uh testing in your

876
00:29:18,960 --> 00:29:21,520
pipelines

877
00:29:21,840 --> 00:29:24,159
now has anyone talked about the supply

878
00:29:24,159 --> 00:29:26,399
chain at this conference so far but this

879
00:29:26,399 --> 00:29:28,799
slide is just my kind of hot take on it

880
00:29:28,799 --> 00:29:31,200
but also look towards six store two um

881
00:29:31,200 --> 00:29:33,200
luke hines is a fantastic individual

882
00:29:33,200 --> 00:29:35,840
behind part of it um and he is one of

883
00:29:35,840 --> 00:29:37,840
the people that i'm just so uh i've had

884
00:29:37,840 --> 00:29:39,120
the pleasure to get to know over last

885
00:29:39,120 --> 00:29:41,679
year

886
00:29:41,679 --> 00:29:44,159
enforced network policy um who needs

887
00:29:44,159 --> 00:29:46,399
access to the kubernetes api try don't

888
00:29:46,399 --> 00:29:48,880
put on the public internet if possible

889
00:29:48,880 --> 00:29:51,039
uh check the capabilities of your pods

890
00:29:51,039 --> 00:29:54,080
what do your pods actually need um

891
00:29:54,080 --> 00:29:55,919
anything that's public facing needs to

892
00:29:55,919 --> 00:29:58,320
be locked down as well um

893
00:29:58,320 --> 00:29:59,120
and

894
00:29:59,120 --> 00:30:00,559
if it doesn't need to be any other

895
00:30:00,559 --> 00:30:02,320
public and put as far away from public

896
00:30:02,320 --> 00:30:04,320
as possible and communication with your

897
00:30:04,320 --> 00:30:07,440
cluster is key to

898
00:30:07,440 --> 00:30:09,440
manage your secrets with whatever makes

899
00:30:09,440 --> 00:30:11,840
you happy um whatever it is just make

900
00:30:11,840 --> 00:30:14,000
sure that you're managing them um a

901
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:16,559
mission control uh to use the context of

902
00:30:16,559 --> 00:30:18,640
what's being shared no one should be

903
00:30:18,640 --> 00:30:20,640
able to read what's in you in my volume

904
00:30:20,640 --> 00:30:23,120
and no one can read what's in my volume

905
00:30:23,120 --> 00:30:26,959
that is how i like to have my volumes

906
00:30:27,200 --> 00:30:29,200
so we have controls for the security

907
00:30:29,200 --> 00:30:31,440
requirements i'm giving a talk at moment

908
00:30:31,440 --> 00:30:33,600
and i understand that you're living in

909
00:30:33,600 --> 00:30:35,600
your real life and we have struggles

910
00:30:35,600 --> 00:30:37,120
from business as well and everything

911
00:30:37,120 --> 00:30:39,279
else around us that we might not be able

912
00:30:39,279 --> 00:30:41,760
to share or show so just do the best job

913
00:30:41,760 --> 00:30:44,559
that you can prioritize risk and do what

914
00:30:44,559 --> 00:30:47,120
you can

915
00:30:47,440 --> 00:30:49,120
it's important to look back as well as

916
00:30:49,120 --> 00:30:51,120
forward so have we achieved what we have

917
00:30:51,120 --> 00:30:53,120
set out to do look to others for their

918
00:30:53,120 --> 00:30:54,880
reviews is there something that you have

919
00:30:54,880 --> 00:30:57,120
missed out testing testing testing which

920
00:30:57,120 --> 00:30:58,640
we'll look at now in the next slide and

921
00:30:58,640 --> 00:31:00,640
as time moves on our acceptable level

922
00:31:00,640 --> 00:31:03,039
may change document decisions made now

923
00:31:03,039 --> 00:31:06,880
so that you are consistent going forward

924
00:31:06,880 --> 00:31:08,240
select security controls for

925
00:31:08,240 --> 00:31:10,720
implementation map these controls onto

926
00:31:10,720 --> 00:31:12,559
the attack trees this provides a direct

927
00:31:12,559 --> 00:31:15,039
means of evaluating effectiveness visual

928
00:31:15,039 --> 00:31:17,039
representations are easier to reason

929
00:31:17,039 --> 00:31:19,360
about identify how many nodes and

930
00:31:19,360 --> 00:31:20,799
branches of the attack tree are covered

931
00:31:20,799 --> 00:31:23,039
by the mitigating controls this assesses

932
00:31:23,039 --> 00:31:25,120
the resulting security of the system if

933
00:31:25,120 --> 00:31:27,039
enough security controls are defined any

934
00:31:27,039 --> 00:31:28,559
new attacks added to the tree should be

935
00:31:28,559 --> 00:31:32,000
mitigated by existing controls

936
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:33,600
so in the skit repo you'll find an

937
00:31:33,600 --> 00:31:35,919
example of using gus to test out a

938
00:31:35,919 --> 00:31:38,720
security requirement of our cluster the

939
00:31:38,720 --> 00:31:41,440
tldr is that if the test fails the

940
00:31:41,440 --> 00:31:43,120
security requirement is not being met

941
00:31:43,120 --> 00:31:45,039
and this requires a review

942
00:31:45,039 --> 00:31:46,559
it allows your team to continue to

943
00:31:46,559 --> 00:31:50,080
contribute code with confidence

944
00:31:50,080 --> 00:31:51,360
now we're coming to the end and i

945
00:31:51,360 --> 00:31:53,519
haven't spoken about wales so far i'm

946
00:31:53,519 --> 00:31:55,600
proud about where i come from and i feel

947
00:31:55,600 --> 00:31:56,799
like you should be right by where you

948
00:31:56,799 --> 00:31:58,080
come from too

949
00:31:58,080 --> 00:32:00,399
um i am a chapter leader for devs.com

950
00:32:00,399 --> 00:32:04,240
wales and we are castle we are castles

951
00:32:04,240 --> 00:32:07,120
we have so many castles in wales um and

952
00:32:07,120 --> 00:32:09,200
i feel that castles are the og threat

953
00:32:09,200 --> 00:32:10,640
mod thing if you ever get the

954
00:32:10,640 --> 00:32:12,320
opportunity to walk around the castle

955
00:32:12,320 --> 00:32:13,840
this is it just like look at this and

956
00:32:13,840 --> 00:32:15,760
just think about how they fret models

957
00:32:15,760 --> 00:32:17,679
and how all this architecture is built

958
00:32:17,679 --> 00:32:19,600
to keep people out

959
00:32:19,600 --> 00:32:22,159
um but to that as well i thought there's

960
00:32:22,159 --> 00:32:23,760
a song from wales that's a good way to

961
00:32:23,760 --> 00:32:26,080
leave this talk

962
00:32:26,080 --> 00:32:28,799
it only takes one project to identify a

963
00:32:28,799 --> 00:32:30,559
thousand frets and it only takes one

964
00:32:30,559 --> 00:32:33,200
fret to burn a thousand projects

965
00:32:33,200 --> 00:32:34,799
so on that i would like to say thank you

966
00:32:34,799 --> 00:32:36,320
for your time i hope you enjoy the rest

967
00:32:36,320 --> 00:32:37,600
of the day and i hope you enjoyed the

968
00:32:37,600 --> 00:32:41,799
rest of the conference thank you

969
00:32:42,240 --> 00:32:44,480
that was fantastic

970
00:32:44,480 --> 00:32:48,000
uh louis if that is who you really are

971
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:49,919
by the way because now you got me i mean

972
00:32:49,919 --> 00:32:51,760
i'm already a paranoid individual but

973
00:32:51,760 --> 00:32:54,080
after this session i'm a bit more

974
00:32:54,080 --> 00:32:56,720
paranoid thank you very much

975
00:32:56,720 --> 00:32:58,240
it's so good that's

976
00:32:58,240 --> 00:32:59,919
there's a lot of there's a group that

977
00:32:59,919 --> 00:33:01,440
can help you with this from after my

978
00:33:01,440 --> 00:33:04,000
talk so it's been set up and so um yeah

979
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:05,760
it's a there's a lot that goes on in

980
00:33:05,760 --> 00:33:07,039
here so um

981
00:33:07,039 --> 00:33:09,120
at least you're outside of it i guess

982
00:33:09,120 --> 00:33:10,880
yes well one i want to thank you for

983
00:33:10,880 --> 00:33:12,000
your message on mental health at the

984
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:14,399
beginning it means a lot i appreciate it

985
00:33:14,399 --> 00:33:16,799
um and two yeah like this was uh

986
00:33:16,799 --> 00:33:19,279
fantastic in terms of just making me

987
00:33:19,279 --> 00:33:20,640
aware because i'm not i'm not very

988
00:33:20,640 --> 00:33:22,080
knowledgeable in kubernetes but hearing

989
00:33:22,080 --> 00:33:24,000
of all the different ways of thinking

990
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:26,159
about possible threats that are

991
00:33:26,159 --> 00:33:28,240
available or could be happening in that

992
00:33:28,240 --> 00:33:30,640
space let alone gets me thinking beyond

993
00:33:30,640 --> 00:33:32,240
that too for other development practices

994
00:33:32,240 --> 00:33:34,080
that i have in place for my own projects

995
00:33:34,080 --> 00:33:36,080
or on a team and so forth so thank you

996
00:33:36,080 --> 00:33:37,519
so much for that

997
00:33:37,519 --> 00:33:39,120
um

998
00:33:39,120 --> 00:33:40,960
yeah so one question we got from the

999
00:33:40,960 --> 00:33:43,519
chat and that was from shirat i believe

1000
00:33:43,519 --> 00:33:45,519
that they had for you was from a risk

1001
00:33:45,519 --> 00:33:47,200
management lens

1002
00:33:47,200 --> 00:33:48,880
oops that went away

1003
00:33:48,880 --> 00:33:50,880
from a risk management lens how are you

1004
00:33:50,880 --> 00:33:54,960
how are threats different for risks

1005
00:33:55,440 --> 00:33:57,600
risk management lens how are threats

1006
00:33:57,600 --> 00:34:00,399
different for

1007
00:34:02,799 --> 00:34:07,279
great question and this is taking me off

1008
00:34:07,279 --> 00:34:08,239
it's

1009
00:34:08,239 --> 00:34:09,679
this is difficulty with wrap modeling

1010
00:34:09,679 --> 00:34:11,119
it's the context that we're putting it

1011
00:34:11,119 --> 00:34:13,199
in because we're trying to put process

1012
00:34:13,199 --> 00:34:15,440
into something that's being created and

1013
00:34:15,440 --> 00:34:16,719
i don't know if you guys would feel

1014
00:34:16,719 --> 00:34:18,079
differently about it so please feel free

1015
00:34:18,079 --> 00:34:20,879
to join in and the answer um

1016
00:34:20,879 --> 00:34:23,520
the threats that you have like

1017
00:34:23,520 --> 00:34:25,359
it might not incidentally be a threat it

1018
00:34:25,359 --> 00:34:27,199
could be that someone can uh jump onto

1019
00:34:27,199 --> 00:34:28,879
this box but then it's a case of well

1020
00:34:28,879 --> 00:34:30,159
actually we're fine with people jumping

1021
00:34:30,159 --> 00:34:31,440
onto the box if we're trying to use

1022
00:34:31,440 --> 00:34:33,040
canary tokens and we want to show off

1023
00:34:33,040 --> 00:34:34,480
our product we want people to actively

1024
00:34:34,480 --> 00:34:36,079
jump onto this box

1025
00:34:36,079 --> 00:34:38,239
um but then equally if you are a

1026
00:34:38,239 --> 00:34:40,800
multinational organization that

1027
00:34:40,800 --> 00:34:42,079
doesn't want anyone jumping anywhere

1028
00:34:42,079 --> 00:34:44,320
near their boss their boxes then that's

1029
00:34:44,320 --> 00:34:46,399
a huge threat and that rep threat is

1030
00:34:46,399 --> 00:34:49,199
identified as a risk to the business so

1031
00:34:49,199 --> 00:34:52,079
i hope that helps but um and again i

1032
00:34:52,079 --> 00:34:53,040
realize

1033
00:34:53,040 --> 00:34:54,480
i feel like i'm doing a bit of a british

1034
00:34:54,480 --> 00:34:56,239
politician thing here of not necessarily

1035
00:34:56,239 --> 00:34:57,839
answering the question that by answering

1036
00:34:57,839 --> 00:34:59,680
my own question so i

1037
00:34:59,680 --> 00:35:00,839
i hope that

1038
00:35:00,839 --> 00:35:04,000
helps i think so i think so um and then

1039
00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:06,079
i see in in chat just referencing the

1040
00:35:06,079 --> 00:35:07,760
the closing of your talk zach curtis was

1041
00:35:07,760 --> 00:35:10,000
saying castles are the og of threat

1042
00:35:10,000 --> 00:35:11,760
modeling brilliant they like that that

1043
00:35:11,760 --> 00:35:13,599
line well done

1044
00:35:13,599 --> 00:35:15,520
well um

1045
00:35:15,520 --> 00:35:17,760
thank you for that as well i'm happy

1046
00:35:17,760 --> 00:35:19,839
with that when i said that by accident

1047
00:35:19,839 --> 00:35:21,040
one day and i was like oh actually they

1048
00:35:21,040 --> 00:35:22,160
are so

1049
00:35:22,160 --> 00:35:24,000
cool there you go perfect

1050
00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:25,280
eric did you have any other questions

1051
00:35:25,280 --> 00:35:26,560
that you saw that popped up or maybe

1052
00:35:26,560 --> 00:35:28,320
some of your own to share

1053
00:35:28,320 --> 00:35:30,400
no i just to follow on you with the your

1054
00:35:30,400 --> 00:35:31,680
answer to the question about threats and

1055
00:35:31,680 --> 00:35:33,520
risks i think it's it is a harder one to

1056
00:35:33,520 --> 00:35:35,359
answer because they are kind of tied

1057
00:35:35,359 --> 00:35:36,720
hand-in-hand

1058
00:35:36,720 --> 00:35:39,680
the way i always look at it is that

1059
00:35:39,680 --> 00:35:42,320
the threat is kind of the

1060
00:35:42,320 --> 00:35:44,560
hypothetical or even literal path to

1061
00:35:44,560 --> 00:35:45,599
which you

1062
00:35:45,599 --> 00:35:48,560
exploit a vulnerability or a risk right

1063
00:35:48,560 --> 00:35:49,359
so

1064
00:35:49,359 --> 00:35:51,599
it's kind of like the avenue by which

1065
00:35:51,599 --> 00:35:54,320
the risk is exploited is that

1066
00:35:54,320 --> 00:35:56,320
jive with you

1067
00:35:56,320 --> 00:35:59,280
yeah that drives with me it's um yeah

1068
00:35:59,280 --> 00:36:01,520
it's

1069
00:36:02,480 --> 00:36:04,640
it's always a like i can't

1070
00:36:04,640 --> 00:36:06,480
express when we do threat modeling it's

1071
00:36:06,480 --> 00:36:07,839
always when

1072
00:36:07,839 --> 00:36:09,680
no threat models are the same and this

1073
00:36:09,680 --> 00:36:11,200
is a point about having your voice heard

1074
00:36:11,200 --> 00:36:12,720
and this is

1075
00:36:12,720 --> 00:36:14,560
what i try to express within this talk

1076
00:36:14,560 --> 00:36:15,520
is that

1077
00:36:15,520 --> 00:36:17,680
just be confident in i remember first my

1078
00:36:17,680 --> 00:36:19,599
friend modeled and i was terrified that

1079
00:36:19,599 --> 00:36:21,280
i was saying the wrong thing but the

1080
00:36:21,280 --> 00:36:22,960
first thing i said was really valuable

1081
00:36:22,960 --> 00:36:24,800
because it was another perception of our

1082
00:36:24,800 --> 00:36:26,960
system that no one else has seen

1083
00:36:26,960 --> 00:36:28,640
and in doing so it's just having that

1084
00:36:28,640 --> 00:36:30,320
confidence just to raise your voice and

1085
00:36:30,320 --> 00:36:32,160
say right i think this is a potential

1086
00:36:32,160 --> 00:36:33,200
issue here

1087
00:36:33,200 --> 00:36:35,760
and and it comes back to that issue of

1088
00:36:35,760 --> 00:36:37,839
risk like the risk is is this for your

1089
00:36:37,839 --> 00:36:39,680
business or is this for a consumer or is

1090
00:36:39,680 --> 00:36:41,280
this just for a random person somewhere

1091
00:36:41,280 --> 00:36:42,400
who doesn't

1092
00:36:42,400 --> 00:36:43,839
because we have lots of trust the

1093
00:36:43,839 --> 00:36:45,920
internet is based on trust

1094
00:36:45,920 --> 00:36:47,839
and when you share your information

1095
00:36:47,839 --> 00:36:49,680
who's managing that and if it's you then

1096
00:36:49,680 --> 00:36:51,680
i hope you're doing a really good job so

1097
00:36:51,680 --> 00:36:54,480
yeah

1098
00:36:54,480 --> 00:36:57,280
