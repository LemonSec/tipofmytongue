[Music]

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:05,680
let me bring that even to the stage

3
00:00:05,680 --> 00:00:09,200
please i'll just turn these banners off

4
00:00:09,200 --> 00:00:10,559
okay yeah so

5
00:00:10,559 --> 00:00:11,599
so uh

6
00:00:11,599 --> 00:00:14,080
hello eva hello

7
00:00:14,080 --> 00:00:17,199
so eva is the uh thank you for coming

8
00:00:17,199 --> 00:00:18,960
eva is the principal product security

9
00:00:18,960 --> 00:00:21,119
engineer at the uh orth product unit of

10
00:00:21,119 --> 00:00:22,000
octa

11
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:24,320
um and today she's going to talk to us

12
00:00:24,320 --> 00:00:26,880
about lessons learned from helping scale

13
00:00:26,880 --> 00:00:28,720
a product security program from startup

14
00:00:28,720 --> 00:00:32,320
to acquisition so eva over to you thank

15
00:00:32,320 --> 00:00:33,280
you

16
00:00:33,280 --> 00:00:35,920
so uh hi everyone i'm super excited to

17
00:00:35,920 --> 00:00:39,200
be here and in the next 30 minutes i'll

18
00:00:39,200 --> 00:00:41,600
share what i learned from being part of

19
00:00:41,600 --> 00:00:44,239
a product security team from a startup

20
00:00:44,239 --> 00:00:45,920
to an acquisition

21
00:00:45,920 --> 00:00:48,559
a few more details for me uh

22
00:00:48,559 --> 00:00:50,320
i said i'm a principal product security

23
00:00:50,320 --> 00:00:52,320
engineer of zero of zero is a product

24
00:00:52,320 --> 00:00:53,760
unit of octa

25
00:00:53,760 --> 00:00:56,719
i joined with zero back in 2018 back

26
00:00:56,719 --> 00:00:57,680
then

27
00:00:57,680 --> 00:01:01,039
had roughly 200 400 employees and the

28
00:01:01,039 --> 00:01:02,719
product security team was doing small

29
00:01:02,719 --> 00:01:04,000
steps

30
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:06,560
fast forward last year of zero was

31
00:01:06,560 --> 00:01:09,200
acquired by octa and at that point all

32
00:01:09,200 --> 00:01:11,600
zero had roughly a thousand employees at

33
00:01:11,600 --> 00:01:14,320
a mature secure product security program

34
00:01:14,320 --> 00:01:16,640
so this talks about those four years and

35
00:01:16,640 --> 00:01:18,400
the journey and what i learned through

36
00:01:18,400 --> 00:01:20,720
that journey on my free time i do dance

37
00:01:20,720 --> 00:01:22,880
classes balear contemporary i play the

38
00:01:22,880 --> 00:01:24,960
piano the clarinet i love outdoor

39
00:01:24,960 --> 00:01:27,439
activities and this is my dog tropha

40
00:01:27,439 --> 00:01:30,640
which i also love spending time with

41
00:01:30,640 --> 00:01:31,439
uh

42
00:01:31,439 --> 00:01:33,119
sort of a disclaimer what this talk is

43
00:01:33,119 --> 00:01:35,680
about and what i'll cover and what not

44
00:01:35,680 --> 00:01:37,600
this is about my observations and the

45
00:01:37,600 --> 00:01:39,280
things that i learned

46
00:01:39,280 --> 00:01:40,960
through that uh

47
00:01:40,960 --> 00:01:43,040
journey of what zero from a startup to a

48
00:01:43,040 --> 00:01:45,200
mid-sized company and myself being part

49
00:01:45,200 --> 00:01:47,680
of the product security team i will this

50
00:01:47,680 --> 00:01:50,720
talk is known about how xero product

51
00:01:50,720 --> 00:01:52,880
security program or team look like what

52
00:01:52,880 --> 00:01:54,960
decisions we took and so on

53
00:01:54,960 --> 00:01:57,439
and to that regard the rest of the talk

54
00:01:57,439 --> 00:01:59,280
will be about a fictional product

55
00:01:59,280 --> 00:02:01,680
security team and the different stages

56
00:02:01,680 --> 00:02:02,560
that go

57
00:02:02,560 --> 00:02:05,759
for example a small team short stuff

58
00:02:05,759 --> 00:02:09,199
uh laying the foundations how you mature

59
00:02:09,199 --> 00:02:11,440
and how we scale

60
00:02:11,440 --> 00:02:13,920
and with that let's say that

61
00:02:13,920 --> 00:02:16,160
there is a company and they you get

62
00:02:16,160 --> 00:02:18,239
hired as one of the first two product

63
00:02:18,239 --> 00:02:20,480
security engineers and the new product

64
00:02:20,480 --> 00:02:22,959
security team is formed

65
00:02:22,959 --> 00:02:25,200
one question you may have is where to

66
00:02:25,200 --> 00:02:26,160
start

67
00:02:26,160 --> 00:02:28,720
and in two big buckets we can split it

68
00:02:28,720 --> 00:02:30,480
into should i focus on the security of

69
00:02:30,480 --> 00:02:32,640
the new features or should i focus on

70
00:02:32,640 --> 00:02:34,720
the security of the existing product

71
00:02:34,720 --> 00:02:36,560
if you were to focus on the first one on

72
00:02:36,560 --> 00:02:38,560
the security of the new features

73
00:02:38,560 --> 00:02:40,720
you will succeed you will successfully

74
00:02:40,720 --> 00:02:42,560
start applying the shift left approach

75
00:02:42,560 --> 00:02:46,160
you can start having design reviews um

76
00:02:46,160 --> 00:02:48,160
security reviews during the design and

77
00:02:48,160 --> 00:02:49,760
this will be effective in stopping

78
00:02:49,760 --> 00:02:51,840
vulnerabilities from entering the coding

79
00:02:51,840 --> 00:02:53,440
new product features

80
00:02:53,440 --> 00:02:55,440
but if you were to only focus on this

81
00:02:55,440 --> 00:02:58,400
one uh any undiscovered vulnerabilities

82
00:02:58,400 --> 00:03:00,400
in the existing program the product

83
00:03:00,400 --> 00:03:02,480
would still remain and this would pose a

84
00:03:02,480 --> 00:03:04,800
significant security risk

85
00:03:04,800 --> 00:03:06,319
now if we're going to go on the other

86
00:03:06,319 --> 00:03:07,920
side let's say we're focusing only on

87
00:03:07,920 --> 00:03:10,000
the security of an exist of the existing

88
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:11,040
product

89
00:03:11,040 --> 00:03:12,879
here yes we will uh

90
00:03:12,879 --> 00:03:16,239
uncover uh vulnerabilities and based on

91
00:03:16,239 --> 00:03:17,840
that we will be able to assess what is

92
00:03:17,840 --> 00:03:19,599
the risk that we have and plan

93
00:03:19,599 --> 00:03:21,120
mitigating it

94
00:03:21,120 --> 00:03:23,840
but we will suffer uh

95
00:03:23,840 --> 00:03:25,760
the same thing on the new features if we

96
00:03:25,760 --> 00:03:27,519
do nothing for the new features we will

97
00:03:27,519 --> 00:03:30,720
have a vulnerability to produce there

98
00:03:30,720 --> 00:03:32,799
of course it's not a one or the other

99
00:03:32,799 --> 00:03:35,120
there is a balance uh but my suggestion

100
00:03:35,120 --> 00:03:37,440
is during the very early stages at least

101
00:03:37,440 --> 00:03:39,200
for the first couple of quarters you

102
00:03:39,200 --> 00:03:41,920
need to give some um

103
00:03:41,920 --> 00:03:43,920
some attention to the existing product

104
00:03:43,920 --> 00:03:46,400
so that we have a baseline on what is

105
00:03:46,400 --> 00:03:48,640
your security posture up to that moment

106
00:03:48,640 --> 00:03:50,799
and at the same point you will start

107
00:03:50,799 --> 00:03:53,120
rolling out um

108
00:03:53,120 --> 00:03:56,000
processes and tools to help on the

109
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:58,879
security by design journey

110
00:03:58,879 --> 00:04:01,200
on the topic on security of the existing

111
00:04:01,200 --> 00:04:03,519
product when you first join a team a

112
00:04:03,519 --> 00:04:06,400
company you may not know the product and

113
00:04:06,400 --> 00:04:08,239
asking the question where the bodies are

114
00:04:08,239 --> 00:04:10,480
buried uh where the security bags are

115
00:04:10,480 --> 00:04:12,640
hidden it may be a difficult or

116
00:04:12,640 --> 00:04:15,599
challenging task

117
00:04:15,599 --> 00:04:18,238
my suggestion is ask engineers the

118
00:04:18,238 --> 00:04:20,238
engineers who developed the product to

119
00:04:20,238 --> 00:04:21,839
develop the features

120
00:04:21,839 --> 00:04:24,080
know when they took a shortcut know when

121
00:04:24,080 --> 00:04:26,720
they did things not perfectly

122
00:04:26,720 --> 00:04:29,199
when they did it they may didn't know

123
00:04:29,199 --> 00:04:31,840
the impact of it but if you ask them i'm

124
00:04:31,840 --> 00:04:33,280
pretty sure they can point you to some

125
00:04:33,280 --> 00:04:35,919
pretty interesting directions

126
00:04:35,919 --> 00:04:37,440
if you want to make it a bit of a more

127
00:04:37,440 --> 00:04:40,240
fun activity uh collaborate with your

128
00:04:40,240 --> 00:04:42,560
engineering peers and conduct some

129
00:04:42,560 --> 00:04:45,280
engineering wide back hunting days so

130
00:04:45,280 --> 00:04:47,199
engineering teams and security teams

131
00:04:47,199 --> 00:04:50,160
group together to hunt some security

132
00:04:50,160 --> 00:04:51,360
backs

133
00:04:51,360 --> 00:04:53,840
and the third one is it's possible that

134
00:04:53,840 --> 00:04:56,160
the company you are joining already had

135
00:04:56,160 --> 00:04:58,560
done a third party pen test

136
00:04:58,560 --> 00:05:01,039
but my suggestion is have another one at

137
00:05:01,039 --> 00:05:02,560
that point that you're forming the

138
00:05:02,560 --> 00:05:04,240
product security team and you're

139
00:05:04,240 --> 00:05:06,400
starting to roll out a program because

140
00:05:06,400 --> 00:05:08,960
this will give you a baseline of of the

141
00:05:08,960 --> 00:05:11,840
existing posture you will know how how

142
00:05:11,840 --> 00:05:14,800
the product looks like from the external

143
00:05:14,800 --> 00:05:17,680
vulnerability surface

144
00:05:17,680 --> 00:05:19,520
this is for the existing product but we

145
00:05:19,520 --> 00:05:21,759
said we also need to do some work on the

146
00:05:21,759 --> 00:05:24,080
new features and a question we will

147
00:05:24,080 --> 00:05:26,080
always ask whether it's in this very

148
00:05:26,080 --> 00:05:28,240
early stage or further down the road is

149
00:05:28,240 --> 00:05:30,880
how we prioritize how we work on on

150
00:05:30,880 --> 00:05:33,759
assessing on consulting on those new

151
00:05:33,759 --> 00:05:34,800
features

152
00:05:34,800 --> 00:05:37,759
what i've seen that works really well

153
00:05:37,759 --> 00:05:40,000
is a risk assessment questionnaire a

154
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:42,560
risk assessment questionnaire is a list

155
00:05:42,560 --> 00:05:43,840
of questions

156
00:05:43,840 --> 00:05:46,479
that engineering teams need to fill

157
00:05:46,479 --> 00:05:49,440
during the start of their uh of their

158
00:05:49,440 --> 00:05:50,639
design

159
00:05:50,639 --> 00:05:52,639
and it it's a list of questions that

160
00:05:52,639 --> 00:05:56,160
help determine risk some examples are uh

161
00:05:56,160 --> 00:05:58,240
does the feature you're building change

162
00:05:58,240 --> 00:06:00,800
how authentication authorization work

163
00:06:00,800 --> 00:06:02,880
um are you going to do some sort of

164
00:06:02,880 --> 00:06:05,280
encryption do you handle secret

165
00:06:05,280 --> 00:06:07,280
sensitive data or personal data and so

166
00:06:07,280 --> 00:06:08,080
on

167
00:06:08,080 --> 00:06:10,160
and try that the answers in those

168
00:06:10,160 --> 00:06:12,479
questions have a yes and a no

169
00:06:12,479 --> 00:06:14,240
and the reason is we want based on the

170
00:06:14,240 --> 00:06:15,280
answers

171
00:06:15,280 --> 00:06:17,759
to quantify the risk and this is where

172
00:06:17,759 --> 00:06:19,680
you would need to create a risk or

173
00:06:19,680 --> 00:06:21,759
scoring algorithm

174
00:06:21,759 --> 00:06:23,919
now in the beginning the rescoring

175
00:06:23,919 --> 00:06:25,680
algorithm will not be perfect and the

176
00:06:25,680 --> 00:06:27,840
reason is you when you create it you

177
00:06:27,840 --> 00:06:30,319
don't have past data to validate it

178
00:06:30,319 --> 00:06:32,240
against so maybe in the beginning you

179
00:06:32,240 --> 00:06:33,919
can use a combination of your gut

180
00:06:33,919 --> 00:06:35,840
filling and what the risk scoring

181
00:06:35,840 --> 00:06:38,160
algorithm says but this means you will

182
00:06:38,160 --> 00:06:39,919
you will need eventually to iterate on

183
00:06:39,919 --> 00:06:41,199
that algorithm

184
00:06:41,199 --> 00:06:42,720
so based on that

185
00:06:42,720 --> 00:06:44,400
with that questionnaire that is filled

186
00:06:44,400 --> 00:06:46,960
by engineering teams and ideally it

187
00:06:46,960 --> 00:06:49,199
automatically provides there is score of

188
00:06:49,199 --> 00:06:51,360
this project you can assess the risk of

189
00:06:51,360 --> 00:06:53,759
an upcoming project and this allows you

190
00:06:53,759 --> 00:06:56,639
to work on a risk-based prioritization

191
00:06:56,639 --> 00:06:58,400
you can start working

192
00:06:58,400 --> 00:07:00,960
on on design reviews for high-risk

193
00:07:00,960 --> 00:07:03,280
projects and depending on your on your

194
00:07:03,280 --> 00:07:05,280
capacity you could move to to more

195
00:07:05,280 --> 00:07:06,960
medium risk once

196
00:07:06,960 --> 00:07:08,160
now

197
00:07:08,160 --> 00:07:10,240
this doesn't mean that for medium and

198
00:07:10,240 --> 00:07:12,400
low risk once we

199
00:07:12,400 --> 00:07:14,800
we offer nothing to our engineers and

200
00:07:14,800 --> 00:07:16,960
this is where i think that security best

201
00:07:16,960 --> 00:07:19,280
practices documentation is a good start

202
00:07:19,280 --> 00:07:21,039
in this very early stage of a product

203
00:07:21,039 --> 00:07:23,680
security program it can be used both for

204
00:07:23,680 --> 00:07:25,680
engineering training but also as a

205
00:07:25,680 --> 00:07:28,000
material to point your engineers for

206
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:30,400
projects that you will not be able to

207
00:07:30,400 --> 00:07:32,400
to consult them as closely as you would

208
00:07:32,400 --> 00:07:34,080
like

209
00:07:34,080 --> 00:07:36,960
and on that regard it's sometimes

210
00:07:36,960 --> 00:07:38,880
difficult to see how you prioritize

211
00:07:38,880 --> 00:07:40,880
there are so many things we need to we

212
00:07:40,880 --> 00:07:43,199
want to educate our engineers and

213
00:07:43,199 --> 00:07:45,599
security best practices and it's not

214
00:07:45,599 --> 00:07:48,000
always clear how to start my situation

215
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:49,360
is map

216
00:07:49,360 --> 00:07:51,280
one question every question of the

217
00:07:51,280 --> 00:07:52,960
security of the risk assessment

218
00:07:52,960 --> 00:07:55,199
questionnaire map it to a security best

219
00:07:55,199 --> 00:07:56,560
practice document

220
00:07:56,560 --> 00:07:59,199
and to go back to the example if there

221
00:07:59,199 --> 00:08:00,800
if there is a question that says are you

222
00:08:00,800 --> 00:08:03,360
using encryption and they have said yes

223
00:08:03,360 --> 00:08:05,680
there should be a security best practice

224
00:08:05,680 --> 00:08:07,919
document on how to implement encryption

225
00:08:07,919 --> 00:08:10,400
correctly and that document needs to be

226
00:08:10,400 --> 00:08:13,199
short and actionable and like those two

227
00:08:13,199 --> 00:08:14,800
are quite important the short and the

228
00:08:14,800 --> 00:08:17,599
actionable and the reason is that

229
00:08:17,599 --> 00:08:19,039
our engineers

230
00:08:19,039 --> 00:08:21,199
need information

231
00:08:21,199 --> 00:08:22,960
to make their implementation and their

232
00:08:22,960 --> 00:08:24,479
design more secure

233
00:08:24,479 --> 00:08:27,599
it's possible that uh you will want to

234
00:08:27,599 --> 00:08:29,759
create a document that explains

235
00:08:29,759 --> 00:08:32,159
why encryption when do we use encryption

236
00:08:32,159 --> 00:08:34,719
and a bit more of a training material

237
00:08:34,719 --> 00:08:36,799
but my suggestion is keep them separate

238
00:08:36,799 --> 00:08:39,120
and have at least one document that is

239
00:08:39,120 --> 00:08:41,519
how do i do it securely how do i design

240
00:08:41,519 --> 00:08:42,719
and how do i implement something

241
00:08:42,719 --> 00:08:45,040
securely

242
00:08:45,040 --> 00:08:46,080
um

243
00:08:46,080 --> 00:08:48,080
on the security testing tools in this

244
00:08:48,080 --> 00:08:50,240
very early stage it's very possible that

245
00:08:50,240 --> 00:08:52,399
there is no budget for commercial tools

246
00:08:52,399 --> 00:08:54,240
this doesn't mean that you cannot roll

247
00:08:54,240 --> 00:08:57,440
out some some security testing

248
00:08:57,440 --> 00:08:59,200
evaluate them very well before the

249
00:08:59,200 --> 00:09:01,839
integration the fact that they are open

250
00:09:01,839 --> 00:09:04,000
source doesn't mean that rolling them

251
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:06,880
out teaching the engineers to use them

252
00:09:06,880 --> 00:09:10,160
and to and to um make actions based on

253
00:09:10,160 --> 00:09:11,760
the findings doesn't mean that this is

254
00:09:11,760 --> 00:09:14,880
called it has zero cost on the contrary

255
00:09:14,880 --> 00:09:17,120
another thing is roll out security tools

256
00:09:17,120 --> 00:09:19,680
progressively

257
00:09:19,680 --> 00:09:22,560
if you want to roll out many tools

258
00:09:22,560 --> 00:09:24,959
roll them little by little and also if

259
00:09:24,959 --> 00:09:26,959
you want to roll out just one tool don't

260
00:09:26,959 --> 00:09:28,959
roll it out to the whole organization

261
00:09:28,959 --> 00:09:31,600
again in both cases the point is we

262
00:09:31,600 --> 00:09:34,320
don't want to overwhelm our engineers

263
00:09:34,320 --> 00:09:36,560
because they will not have the time

264
00:09:36,560 --> 00:09:39,200
uh to learn the new process to learn the

265
00:09:39,200 --> 00:09:43,920
new tool and take action on the findings

266
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:46,560
another point is integrate into ci cd

267
00:09:46,560 --> 00:09:48,560
and especially for security testing

268
00:09:48,560 --> 00:09:51,120
tools like static analysis or software

269
00:09:51,120 --> 00:09:53,760
composition analysis like sneak

270
00:09:53,760 --> 00:09:55,760
you want to be able to add those

271
00:09:55,760 --> 00:09:57,920
security testing tools as a check in

272
00:09:57,920 --> 00:10:00,399
your prs because

273
00:10:00,399 --> 00:10:02,160
you don't have time for manual code

274
00:10:02,160 --> 00:10:03,920
reviews especially in this very early

275
00:10:03,920 --> 00:10:06,800
stage but those testing tools can

276
00:10:06,800 --> 00:10:07,760
can be

277
00:10:07,760 --> 00:10:11,120
an automated security code review

278
00:10:11,120 --> 00:10:13,839
the final thing and i know it's uh it

279
00:10:13,839 --> 00:10:15,680
feels obvious is don't rule out a

280
00:10:15,680 --> 00:10:17,279
security tool with high number of false

281
00:10:17,279 --> 00:10:19,360
positives

282
00:10:19,360 --> 00:10:22,240
doing that you train your engineers that

283
00:10:22,240 --> 00:10:24,480
security testing tools do not give

284
00:10:24,480 --> 00:10:26,160
valuable

285
00:10:26,160 --> 00:10:28,160
valuable results and you train them to

286
00:10:28,160 --> 00:10:30,399
not really pay attention to them so roll

287
00:10:30,399 --> 00:10:31,519
out tools

288
00:10:31,519 --> 00:10:33,200
that have a low number of false

289
00:10:33,200 --> 00:10:35,920
positives or do the first trials to give

290
00:10:35,920 --> 00:10:37,279
them to give to the rest of the

291
00:10:37,279 --> 00:10:40,560
engineers a clear state

292
00:10:40,560 --> 00:10:43,040
vulnerability management i said in the

293
00:10:43,040 --> 00:10:45,920
beginning that during this first uh

294
00:10:45,920 --> 00:10:47,440
laying the foundations of a product

295
00:10:47,440 --> 00:10:49,360
security program you will do some

296
00:10:49,360 --> 00:10:51,360
security testing on the on the existing

297
00:10:51,360 --> 00:10:53,920
product and also we just said that we

298
00:10:53,920 --> 00:10:55,760
will launch out some security testing

299
00:10:55,760 --> 00:10:57,920
tools in both cases this means that we

300
00:10:57,920 --> 00:11:00,800
will have vulnerabilities

301
00:11:00,800 --> 00:11:02,880
as a first step on creating a

302
00:11:02,880 --> 00:11:05,200
vulnerability management program

303
00:11:05,200 --> 00:11:07,120
create something lightweight it can be

304
00:11:07,120 --> 00:11:09,120
as lightweight as the diagram i have on

305
00:11:09,120 --> 00:11:10,480
the side

306
00:11:10,480 --> 00:11:12,480
and something very important is to train

307
00:11:12,480 --> 00:11:14,720
your teams the engineering the product

308
00:11:14,720 --> 00:11:16,399
and the security teams on this new

309
00:11:16,399 --> 00:11:18,399
process remember that vulnerability

310
00:11:18,399 --> 00:11:20,079
management is not a process owned only

311
00:11:20,079 --> 00:11:22,480
by security it's a collaborative process

312
00:11:22,480 --> 00:11:23,360
between

313
00:11:23,360 --> 00:11:26,000
engineering product and security and the

314
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:29,920
success of it depends on all those teams

315
00:11:29,920 --> 00:11:31,440
finally i know that

316
00:11:31,440 --> 00:11:33,760
we are security people we like

317
00:11:33,760 --> 00:11:35,760
slas if it's a high vulnerability it

318
00:11:35,760 --> 00:11:38,079
needs to be fixed in x amount of

319
00:11:38,079 --> 00:11:40,000
days

320
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:40,800
but

321
00:11:40,800 --> 00:11:42,959
don't rush into creating streaks as a

322
00:11:42,959 --> 00:11:45,200
lease if this is not feasible to be met

323
00:11:45,200 --> 00:11:47,120
you are just rolling out a vulnerability

324
00:11:47,120 --> 00:11:48,320
management

325
00:11:48,320 --> 00:11:50,320
program you are building the foundations

326
00:11:50,320 --> 00:11:54,320
for security pro product program

327
00:11:54,320 --> 00:11:55,760
it's possible that

328
00:11:55,760 --> 00:11:58,320
slas will not be bad and putting strict

329
00:11:58,320 --> 00:11:59,760
slas from now

330
00:11:59,760 --> 00:12:01,760
you're mentally training the rest of the

331
00:12:01,760 --> 00:12:04,720
organization that strict slas for

332
00:12:04,720 --> 00:12:07,839
security issues are not that strict

333
00:12:07,839 --> 00:12:09,360
and you'll have heard me in the last

334
00:12:09,360 --> 00:12:13,040
couple of slides saying how you mentally

335
00:12:13,040 --> 00:12:14,720
trained your engineers in the wrong

336
00:12:14,720 --> 00:12:16,160
direction if you do something you know

337
00:12:16,160 --> 00:12:18,160
the other and this is where security

338
00:12:18,160 --> 00:12:20,480
culture comes into play and every time

339
00:12:20,480 --> 00:12:22,720
you take a decision or to do or to not

340
00:12:22,720 --> 00:12:25,279
do something keep in mind how this

341
00:12:25,279 --> 00:12:27,360
affects the security culture and by

342
00:12:27,360 --> 00:12:30,320
security culture i mean how i train the

343
00:12:30,320 --> 00:12:32,240
rest of the organization the engineering

344
00:12:32,240 --> 00:12:33,519
and the product

345
00:12:33,519 --> 00:12:35,600
to value security in the different

346
00:12:35,600 --> 00:12:38,399
processes that we roll out

347
00:12:38,399 --> 00:12:42,079
so this is so far the first uh a first

348
00:12:42,079 --> 00:12:43,519
overview of

349
00:12:43,519 --> 00:12:45,360
of laying down the foundations of a

350
00:12:45,360 --> 00:12:48,000
security osmo product security program

351
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:50,880
we have security training minimal with

352
00:12:50,880 --> 00:12:53,200
security best practice documentation

353
00:12:53,200 --> 00:12:56,320
we do secure design reviews for starting

354
00:12:56,320 --> 00:12:58,079
from high risk projects and going down

355
00:12:58,079 --> 00:13:00,320
depending on our capacity we launched

356
00:13:00,320 --> 00:13:02,959
some open source security testing tools

357
00:13:02,959 --> 00:13:04,959
and we did some security testing on our

358
00:13:04,959 --> 00:13:06,480
existing product

359
00:13:06,480 --> 00:13:08,800
and because we found vulnerabilities we

360
00:13:08,800 --> 00:13:11,279
also created a vulnerability management

361
00:13:11,279 --> 00:13:13,040
process

362
00:13:13,040 --> 00:13:15,360
on the next iteration you can think that

363
00:13:15,360 --> 00:13:17,440
the product security team scales you get

364
00:13:17,440 --> 00:13:20,399
more members and you get more resources

365
00:13:20,399 --> 00:13:23,680
in that next phase the goal is to expand

366
00:13:23,680 --> 00:13:25,680
on the different aspects of your program

367
00:13:25,680 --> 00:13:27,360
that you launched in the first

368
00:13:27,360 --> 00:13:28,959
generation and start adding some

369
00:13:28,959 --> 00:13:30,800
structure

370
00:13:30,800 --> 00:13:32,560
one thing that you may consider when you

371
00:13:32,560 --> 00:13:34,560
get more resources and

372
00:13:34,560 --> 00:13:36,880
you increase the the number of engineers

373
00:13:36,880 --> 00:13:38,480
in your product security team in

374
00:13:38,480 --> 00:13:40,399
security partnerships

375
00:13:40,399 --> 00:13:42,639
when i say security partner is a product

376
00:13:42,639 --> 00:13:45,199
security engineer that is assigned to a

377
00:13:45,199 --> 00:13:48,240
few engineering teams and they become

378
00:13:48,240 --> 00:13:50,880
the security point of contact

379
00:13:50,880 --> 00:13:53,279
security partnerships have some great

380
00:13:53,279 --> 00:13:55,199
validity affairs but also some drawbacks

381
00:13:55,199 --> 00:13:56,480
that you need to take into account

382
00:13:56,480 --> 00:14:00,000
before rolling out such a program

383
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:02,399
i cannot emphasize enough how great

384
00:14:02,399 --> 00:14:04,480
relationship it helps you build

385
00:14:04,480 --> 00:14:07,519
um you have security you have security

386
00:14:07,519 --> 00:14:08,959
engineers working closely with

387
00:14:08,959 --> 00:14:10,399
engineering teams and this really

388
00:14:10,399 --> 00:14:13,199
fosters it fosters the security culture

389
00:14:13,199 --> 00:14:15,760
and it builds great relationships

390
00:14:15,760 --> 00:14:18,240
between security and engineering

391
00:14:18,240 --> 00:14:20,560
also the whole organization has the

392
00:14:20,560 --> 00:14:23,199
confidence that we release features that

393
00:14:23,199 --> 00:14:25,120
are secure by design because we have a

394
00:14:25,120 --> 00:14:27,600
security engineer who also becomes the

395
00:14:27,600 --> 00:14:29,760
subject expert on that specific domain

396
00:14:29,760 --> 00:14:31,519
of the product

397
00:14:31,519 --> 00:14:33,680
now on the other hand

398
00:14:33,680 --> 00:14:35,920
if you roll out a security partnership

399
00:14:35,920 --> 00:14:37,839
program you may see that some

400
00:14:37,839 --> 00:14:40,240
engineering teams can become too

401
00:14:40,240 --> 00:14:42,880
dependent on their security partner and

402
00:14:42,880 --> 00:14:45,760
by two dependent i mean that maybe

403
00:14:45,760 --> 00:14:46,639
they

404
00:14:46,639 --> 00:14:49,360
uh they don't spend so much effort in

405
00:14:49,360 --> 00:14:50,959
learning some security processes that

406
00:14:50,959 --> 00:14:52,880
you're rolling out or some tooling

407
00:14:52,880 --> 00:14:54,320
because they know that they have their

408
00:14:54,320 --> 00:14:56,240
security partner who will nudge them to

409
00:14:56,240 --> 00:14:59,360
the right direction also maybe at some

410
00:14:59,360 --> 00:15:02,000
point in the growth of both the company

411
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:03,440
and the

412
00:15:03,440 --> 00:15:05,360
product security maybe you have a good

413
00:15:05,360 --> 00:15:07,279
enough ratio so that one product

414
00:15:07,279 --> 00:15:09,040
security engineer can be assigned to a

415
00:15:09,040 --> 00:15:11,440
couple of engineering teams as the

416
00:15:11,440 --> 00:15:14,000
company scales this will not scale well

417
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:15,360
and this is the scaling issues i

418
00:15:15,360 --> 00:15:18,399
mentioned and on that regard

419
00:15:18,399 --> 00:15:20,000
i have a couple of options as

420
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:22,000
alternatives not alternatives different

421
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:24,160
forms of security partnerships

422
00:15:24,160 --> 00:15:26,399
one is instead of assigning security

423
00:15:26,399 --> 00:15:29,040
partners to all the teams assign them

424
00:15:29,040 --> 00:15:31,759
only to teams that are working high-risk

425
00:15:31,759 --> 00:15:34,480
parts of the product

426
00:15:34,480 --> 00:15:36,320
or another option is instead of

427
00:15:36,320 --> 00:15:38,720
assigning security partners to projects

428
00:15:38,720 --> 00:15:40,720
assign it to teams assign them to

429
00:15:40,720 --> 00:15:41,759
projects

430
00:15:41,759 --> 00:15:43,600
for example if you know that

431
00:15:43,600 --> 00:15:44,959
there is a

432
00:15:44,959 --> 00:15:46,880
new project coming up that will be i

433
00:15:46,880 --> 00:15:48,800
don't know a couple of quarters

434
00:15:48,800 --> 00:15:51,279
this is a good time it's a high risk one

435
00:15:51,279 --> 00:15:53,360
this is a good time to assign a security

436
00:15:53,360 --> 00:15:55,440
partner for that project

437
00:15:55,440 --> 00:15:59,120
and the second option it helps because

438
00:15:59,120 --> 00:16:00,959
engineering teams cannot become too

439
00:16:00,959 --> 00:16:03,279
dependent because they get a security

440
00:16:03,279 --> 00:16:05,199
partner only for their project and not

441
00:16:05,199 --> 00:16:07,680
for the whole for the whole the folly of

442
00:16:07,680 --> 00:16:09,839
their team

443
00:16:09,839 --> 00:16:12,000
moving forward from security

444
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:14,800
partnerships security champions i said

445
00:16:14,800 --> 00:16:17,199
that security partnership may have some

446
00:16:17,199 --> 00:16:20,240
scaling issues security champions is the

447
00:16:20,240 --> 00:16:22,000
solution to the scaling issues that you

448
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:23,920
will face in your product security

449
00:16:23,920 --> 00:16:25,920
program

450
00:16:25,920 --> 00:16:28,160
my suggestion is invest in a security

451
00:16:28,160 --> 00:16:31,040
champions program early i know that when

452
00:16:31,040 --> 00:16:33,440
you start investing in such a program

453
00:16:33,440 --> 00:16:35,759
you may not see immediately the return

454
00:16:35,759 --> 00:16:38,079
in this investment and this this is a

455
00:16:38,079 --> 00:16:40,720
reason that you may be prioritize this

456
00:16:40,720 --> 00:16:42,880
my advice is don't do it

457
00:16:42,880 --> 00:16:45,360
it needs time to train to train your

458
00:16:45,360 --> 00:16:47,440
engineers into becoming security

459
00:16:47,440 --> 00:16:49,680
champions and further down the road you

460
00:16:49,680 --> 00:16:51,279
will actually see the benefits of doing

461
00:16:51,279 --> 00:16:52,880
that

462
00:16:52,880 --> 00:16:54,560
give them a clear path

463
00:16:54,560 --> 00:16:55,519
uh

464
00:16:55,519 --> 00:16:57,839
and my advice here is

465
00:16:57,839 --> 00:16:58,720
don't

466
00:16:58,720 --> 00:17:02,320
teach them into doing uh

467
00:17:02,320 --> 00:17:04,400
web security testing

468
00:17:04,400 --> 00:17:06,000
teach them things that are applicable to

469
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:09,039
their job and their job is how to design

470
00:17:09,039 --> 00:17:11,280
securely software and how to implement

471
00:17:11,280 --> 00:17:13,439
securely software

472
00:17:13,439 --> 00:17:15,760
and on that regard train them to do some

473
00:17:15,760 --> 00:17:17,599
product security work because again this

474
00:17:17,599 --> 00:17:19,199
is closer to what they're actually there

475
00:17:19,199 --> 00:17:21,599
is actual job designing and implementing

476
00:17:21,599 --> 00:17:22,959
secure software

477
00:17:22,959 --> 00:17:24,520
and start assigning them some

478
00:17:24,520 --> 00:17:26,799
responsibilities so that the training is

479
00:17:26,799 --> 00:17:28,319
not theoretical but they can start

480
00:17:28,319 --> 00:17:30,960
applying it

481
00:17:31,440 --> 00:17:34,480
design reviews in the first iteration i

482
00:17:34,480 --> 00:17:36,640
only mentioned that

483
00:17:36,640 --> 00:17:38,880
following a risk-based prioritization

484
00:17:38,880 --> 00:17:41,440
you can you will do design reviews uh

485
00:17:41,440 --> 00:17:43,039
you will do security reviews during

486
00:17:43,039 --> 00:17:45,440
design i think now it's a good time

487
00:17:45,440 --> 00:17:47,520
after you've said those different uh

488
00:17:47,520 --> 00:17:49,360
practices of the security program

489
00:17:49,360 --> 00:17:51,360
throughout the structure we said and in

490
00:17:51,360 --> 00:17:53,120
that regard during design i think we

491
00:17:53,120 --> 00:17:55,840
need to start moving on threat models

492
00:17:55,840 --> 00:17:58,400
because threat models

493
00:17:58,400 --> 00:17:59,600
train

494
00:17:59,600 --> 00:18:00,960
mentally you

495
00:18:00,960 --> 00:18:02,960
train mentally your engineers in a very

496
00:18:02,960 --> 00:18:05,679
specific way and looking for threats

497
00:18:05,679 --> 00:18:07,840
my suggestion is also create a template

498
00:18:07,840 --> 00:18:10,400
it's um you keep consistent

499
00:18:10,400 --> 00:18:12,559
format to your engineers they know what

500
00:18:12,559 --> 00:18:14,559
to expect how to expect it how it will

501
00:18:14,559 --> 00:18:16,160
look like

502
00:18:16,160 --> 00:18:18,160
it helps understanding what are the

503
00:18:18,160 --> 00:18:19,840
threats when you have a specific threat

504
00:18:19,840 --> 00:18:23,120
model template and as i said before

505
00:18:23,120 --> 00:18:25,360
train your security champions to threat

506
00:18:25,360 --> 00:18:27,520
model have them shadow you in the

507
00:18:27,520 --> 00:18:30,320
beginning or have them um read your

508
00:18:30,320 --> 00:18:32,480
thread model and discuss with you

509
00:18:32,480 --> 00:18:34,799
how you approached it and so on at some

510
00:18:34,799 --> 00:18:36,720
point maybe they can do it with your

511
00:18:36,720 --> 00:18:39,520
consultation

512
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:42,480
security testing tools in the beginning

513
00:18:42,480 --> 00:18:43,200
we

514
00:18:43,200 --> 00:18:45,200
we didn't have budget and we all doubt

515
00:18:45,200 --> 00:18:47,360
some open source tooling maybe now it's

516
00:18:47,360 --> 00:18:49,200
a time to move to some commercial tools

517
00:18:49,200 --> 00:18:51,840
because this gives us some more rich

518
00:18:51,840 --> 00:18:53,360
features

519
00:18:53,360 --> 00:18:55,280
i said it in the previous

520
00:18:55,280 --> 00:18:57,039
time we talked about security testing

521
00:18:57,039 --> 00:18:59,600
tools but take time to evaluate those

522
00:18:59,600 --> 00:19:01,918
tools

523
00:19:02,559 --> 00:19:05,360
when i say evaluate it's not only

524
00:19:05,360 --> 00:19:06,559
about

525
00:19:06,559 --> 00:19:07,520
the

526
00:19:07,520 --> 00:19:09,280
the quality of the findings it's not

527
00:19:09,280 --> 00:19:11,520
only about the ratio of false positives

528
00:19:11,520 --> 00:19:13,840
and to evaluate them well come up with a

529
00:19:13,840 --> 00:19:16,000
list of requirements before you start

530
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:18,880
the evaluation and in that list include

531
00:19:18,880 --> 00:19:20,880
things like tool management can i

532
00:19:20,880 --> 00:19:23,520
customize it can i extend it can i get

533
00:19:23,520 --> 00:19:25,039
metrics out of it

534
00:19:25,039 --> 00:19:26,080
um

535
00:19:26,080 --> 00:19:28,720
does it integrate well with the workflow

536
00:19:28,720 --> 00:19:31,520
of my engineering teams and so on and

537
00:19:31,520 --> 00:19:34,240
one more thing to to pay attention to is

538
00:19:34,240 --> 00:19:36,320
don't assess only the tool capabilities

539
00:19:36,320 --> 00:19:38,480
but also the vendor relationship

540
00:19:38,480 --> 00:19:40,720
the security testing tools vendors are

541
00:19:40,720 --> 00:19:41,520
not

542
00:19:41,520 --> 00:19:44,320
vendors they are partners in our journey

543
00:19:44,320 --> 00:19:46,400
of making a

544
00:19:46,400 --> 00:19:50,080
product security program successful

545
00:19:50,400 --> 00:19:53,360
vulnerability management i said in the

546
00:19:53,360 --> 00:19:55,760
first iteration don't rush into creating

547
00:19:55,760 --> 00:19:58,559
strict slas but we need to start putting

548
00:19:58,559 --> 00:20:01,120
some slas in place so now it's a good

549
00:20:01,120 --> 00:20:03,520
time to start building a cadence of

550
00:20:03,520 --> 00:20:07,039
resolving vulnerabilities in time

551
00:20:07,039 --> 00:20:09,280
you need to get some leadership buying

552
00:20:09,280 --> 00:20:10,400
for that

553
00:20:10,400 --> 00:20:11,760
but

554
00:20:11,760 --> 00:20:14,240
always take a risk-based approach in

555
00:20:14,240 --> 00:20:17,200
your slas and sometimes this means an

556
00:20:17,200 --> 00:20:18,960
fla exception

557
00:20:18,960 --> 00:20:20,880
an example of an sla exception is the

558
00:20:20,880 --> 00:20:22,799
following let's say that there is a

559
00:20:22,799 --> 00:20:25,280
vulnerability uh that can be fixed

560
00:20:25,280 --> 00:20:28,080
within selena's very specific way

561
00:20:28,080 --> 00:20:30,000
but there is also the possibility that

562
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:31,840
instead of fixing this very specific

563
00:20:31,840 --> 00:20:33,679
vulnerability

564
00:20:33,679 --> 00:20:36,159
the engineering team can build a more

565
00:20:36,159 --> 00:20:39,120
holistic solution that can help that can

566
00:20:39,120 --> 00:20:40,720
harden the

567
00:20:40,720 --> 00:20:42,400
the product

568
00:20:42,400 --> 00:20:43,840
on that regard

569
00:20:43,840 --> 00:20:45,919
maybe there is a good trade-off there to

570
00:20:45,919 --> 00:20:48,320
go a bit out of sla to get that that

571
00:20:48,320 --> 00:20:50,159
more holistic solution that is actually

572
00:20:50,159 --> 00:20:51,679
better for the security of the whole

573
00:20:51,679 --> 00:20:53,600
product

574
00:20:53,600 --> 00:20:55,440
another thing is build metrics around

575
00:20:55,440 --> 00:20:57,200
vulnerability management

576
00:20:57,200 --> 00:21:00,159
what metrics each its company will need

577
00:21:00,159 --> 00:21:02,960
is very dependent on the company needs

578
00:21:02,960 --> 00:21:05,440
the security culture and so on but there

579
00:21:05,440 --> 00:21:07,280
is one metric that i find super

580
00:21:07,280 --> 00:21:08,880
important which is metrics on the

581
00:21:08,880 --> 00:21:11,440
vulnerability types

582
00:21:11,440 --> 00:21:13,840
get a

583
00:21:13,840 --> 00:21:15,919
vulnerability taxonomy system it can be

584
00:21:15,919 --> 00:21:18,240
the cwe which is the common weakness

585
00:21:18,240 --> 00:21:21,679
enumeration or any other one that has a

586
00:21:21,679 --> 00:21:23,760
short list of vulnerability types and

587
00:21:23,760 --> 00:21:25,120
start assigning them to your

588
00:21:25,120 --> 00:21:26,640
vulnerabilities

589
00:21:26,640 --> 00:21:29,280
what you get out of it is great metrics

590
00:21:29,280 --> 00:21:32,000
on where you do well and where not for

591
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:33,679
example if you see after a while that

592
00:21:33,679 --> 00:21:36,080
you have too many vulnerabilities and

593
00:21:36,080 --> 00:21:38,240
sensitive data exposure this is a very

594
00:21:38,240 --> 00:21:40,480
good data point both for what kind of

595
00:21:40,480 --> 00:21:41,919
training you need to give to your

596
00:21:41,919 --> 00:21:43,919
engineers but also where where do you

597
00:21:43,919 --> 00:21:46,640
focus your security testing um

598
00:21:46,640 --> 00:21:49,440
capabilities

599
00:21:49,600 --> 00:21:52,159
this is uh this is like a wrap-up of

600
00:21:52,159 --> 00:21:54,880
phase two of a product security program

601
00:21:54,880 --> 00:21:56,080
and

602
00:21:56,080 --> 00:21:58,400
of course this is not just one iteration

603
00:21:58,400 --> 00:22:00,960
there are multiple iterations to get to

604
00:22:00,960 --> 00:22:02,720
that maturity

605
00:22:02,720 --> 00:22:04,880
but at some point

606
00:22:04,880 --> 00:22:07,520
you will reach a mature product security

607
00:22:07,520 --> 00:22:09,360
program and when i say mature i mean

608
00:22:09,360 --> 00:22:11,280
that

609
00:22:11,280 --> 00:22:13,520
engineering and product know when and

610
00:22:13,520 --> 00:22:15,679
how to reach out to you they know what

611
00:22:15,679 --> 00:22:17,840
are their responsibilities what are the

612
00:22:17,840 --> 00:22:19,679
different touch points in the secure

613
00:22:19,679 --> 00:22:21,600
development life cycle

614
00:22:21,600 --> 00:22:24,000
you have loan style tools there is a

615
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:26,159
vulnerability management process that

616
00:22:26,159 --> 00:22:29,039
where slas are being appeared and so on

617
00:22:29,039 --> 00:22:31,840
this is this will probably free up some

618
00:22:31,840 --> 00:22:34,960
time from the product security team

619
00:22:34,960 --> 00:22:37,840
that you can use to do some more some

620
00:22:37,840 --> 00:22:39,840
hardening now on application and

621
00:22:39,840 --> 00:22:42,080
services

622
00:22:42,080 --> 00:22:44,159
it's time that in this time you can

623
00:22:44,159 --> 00:22:46,159
start engineering solutions to solve

624
00:22:46,159 --> 00:22:48,240
groups of vulnerabilities i have some

625
00:22:48,240 --> 00:22:50,559
example here and there are only examples

626
00:22:50,559 --> 00:22:53,440
you can work on hardening against xss

627
00:22:53,440 --> 00:22:56,559
or you can do an assessment on what is

628
00:22:56,559 --> 00:22:58,240
your current application logging and

629
00:22:58,240 --> 00:23:00,559
monitoring for different security events

630
00:23:00,559 --> 00:23:02,320
and then see where there is room for

631
00:23:02,320 --> 00:23:03,679
improvements

632
00:23:03,679 --> 00:23:06,880
or the most hot topic of the last years

633
00:23:06,880 --> 00:23:10,240
is supply chain attack how well is your

634
00:23:10,240 --> 00:23:12,080
organization in detecting them in

635
00:23:12,080 --> 00:23:13,840
preventing them what processes do you

636
00:23:13,840 --> 00:23:16,640
have around it and how can you improve

637
00:23:16,640 --> 00:23:19,760
these are just examples but depending on

638
00:23:19,760 --> 00:23:21,760
on the metrics actually you go from your

639
00:23:21,760 --> 00:23:23,280
vulnerability management pro

640
00:23:23,280 --> 00:23:25,360
vulnerability management program you

641
00:23:25,360 --> 00:23:26,400
will see

642
00:23:26,400 --> 00:23:27,760
where you need your focus your

643
00:23:27,760 --> 00:23:30,559
engineering solutions to start hardening

644
00:23:30,559 --> 00:23:33,440
the code and the product

645
00:23:33,440 --> 00:23:35,200
this is mostly what i had to share i

646
00:23:35,200 --> 00:23:37,679
have some some closing remarks

647
00:23:37,679 --> 00:23:39,919
the first one is work on a product

648
00:23:39,919 --> 00:23:42,640
security program iteratively don't focus

649
00:23:42,640 --> 00:23:45,440
on solving one aspect of the program

650
00:23:45,440 --> 00:23:48,159
while leaving the rest unstarted

651
00:23:48,159 --> 00:23:51,120
and also by the iterations

652
00:23:51,120 --> 00:23:53,039
the more you work on the product the

653
00:23:53,039 --> 00:23:55,360
program you the more you realize how you

654
00:23:55,360 --> 00:23:58,000
need to improve so this this iteration

655
00:23:58,000 --> 00:24:00,559
comes a bit naturally

656
00:24:00,559 --> 00:24:02,440
another thing is there is no

657
00:24:02,440 --> 00:24:04,720
one-size-fits-all approach what i shared

658
00:24:04,720 --> 00:24:07,120
today is my lessons and what

659
00:24:07,120 --> 00:24:09,679
i i learned from being in a specific

660
00:24:09,679 --> 00:24:12,080
company with a specific company a

661
00:24:12,080 --> 00:24:15,120
security culture and so on take from

662
00:24:15,120 --> 00:24:17,039
that talk the things that may be

663
00:24:17,039 --> 00:24:19,360
applicable to your the company you work

664
00:24:19,360 --> 00:24:20,320
for

665
00:24:20,320 --> 00:24:21,840
based on the security culture of that

666
00:24:21,840 --> 00:24:22,960
company

667
00:24:22,960 --> 00:24:25,120
and i i've mentioned security culture a

668
00:24:25,120 --> 00:24:28,080
lot and i just want to reiterate

669
00:24:28,080 --> 00:24:30,320
the company culture on security will

670
00:24:30,320 --> 00:24:32,240
affect your journey and will affect how

671
00:24:32,240 --> 00:24:34,159
successful the product security program

672
00:24:34,159 --> 00:24:36,960
is so in every little detail

673
00:24:36,960 --> 00:24:39,840
in every little decision think how how

674
00:24:39,840 --> 00:24:41,919
what you are doing actually improves the

675
00:24:41,919 --> 00:24:44,559
security culture of your company how you

676
00:24:44,559 --> 00:24:47,039
train their their whole organization

677
00:24:47,039 --> 00:24:49,120
that security is not only the security

678
00:24:49,120 --> 00:24:50,960
team's problem but it's a problem of the

679
00:24:50,960 --> 00:24:53,520
whole of the whole um of the whole

680
00:24:53,520 --> 00:24:55,200
organization and actually it's not a

681
00:24:55,200 --> 00:24:56,559
problem it's not a problem it's

682
00:24:56,559 --> 00:24:58,480
something it's part of the engineering

683
00:24:58,480 --> 00:25:01,120
uh workflow

684
00:25:01,120 --> 00:25:03,200
that's all i had to share

685
00:25:03,200 --> 00:25:05,520
thank you very much for for tuning in

686
00:25:05,520 --> 00:25:06,960
and i'm

687
00:25:06,960 --> 00:25:10,159
open for any questions and this is uh

688
00:25:10,159 --> 00:25:12,720
details

689
00:25:13,360 --> 00:25:15,440
okay even that was

690
00:25:15,440 --> 00:25:18,640
brilliant very sort of hard one through

691
00:25:18,640 --> 00:25:23,120
experience thank you you uh

692
00:25:23,120 --> 00:25:25,679
to the viewers and

693
00:25:25,679 --> 00:25:26,720
um

694
00:25:26,720 --> 00:25:28,960
mad

695
00:25:29,279 --> 00:25:32,320
security champions initiative

696
00:25:32,320 --> 00:25:35,360
and team

697
00:25:35,520 --> 00:25:39,840
and then the security champions maintain

698
00:25:39,840 --> 00:25:43,840
the balance demands

699
00:25:44,240 --> 00:25:46,159
this is a great question

700
00:25:46,159 --> 00:25:48,640
uh and again this is you need great

701
00:25:48,640 --> 00:25:50,880
collaboration between engineering

702
00:25:50,880 --> 00:25:52,480
leadership security and security

703
00:25:52,480 --> 00:25:54,720
leadership

704
00:25:54,720 --> 00:25:56,799
there is no there is no right solution

705
00:25:56,799 --> 00:25:59,200
again it depends on your company but i

706
00:25:59,200 --> 00:26:01,760
think if you can get a buy-in from

707
00:26:01,760 --> 00:26:04,080
engineering and security leadership that

708
00:26:04,080 --> 00:26:07,520
x amount of hours per week are assigned

709
00:26:07,520 --> 00:26:09,440
to security tasks

710
00:26:09,440 --> 00:26:10,400
this is

711
00:26:10,400 --> 00:26:12,640
sometimes it will be less or sometimes

712
00:26:12,640 --> 00:26:15,039
it will be more but if on the leadership

713
00:26:15,039 --> 00:26:17,200
level you get an agreement i don't know

714
00:26:17,200 --> 00:26:18,720
three hours per week

715
00:26:18,720 --> 00:26:21,360
or something like that their security

716
00:26:21,360 --> 00:26:23,039
champions are entitled to work on

717
00:26:23,039 --> 00:26:25,120
security features

718
00:26:25,120 --> 00:26:28,159
uh this will this will

719
00:26:28,159 --> 00:26:29,919
this will help because using the program

720
00:26:29,919 --> 00:26:32,159
the problem is security wants security

721
00:26:32,159 --> 00:26:34,000
champions to do more security and

722
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:35,919
engineering wants their engineers to

723
00:26:35,919 --> 00:26:37,760
actually do feature development so i

724
00:26:37,760 --> 00:26:39,840
think the the most important is having

725
00:26:39,840 --> 00:26:41,279
an agreement on

726
00:26:41,279 --> 00:26:43,440
what is the balance there and what it is

727
00:26:43,440 --> 00:26:47,120
the number it depends on the company

728
00:26:47,120 --> 00:26:48,799
yeah i think that's an interesting point

729
00:26:48,799 --> 00:26:50,559
isn't it you know what kind of where do

730
00:26:50,559 --> 00:26:53,120
you draw the line about i mean we've had

731
00:26:53,120 --> 00:26:55,600
other other speakers today talk about

732
00:26:55,600 --> 00:26:58,240
you know not trying to solve

733
00:26:58,240 --> 00:27:00,400
absolutely every security problem

734
00:27:00,400 --> 00:27:02,080
because it's impossible right you know

735
00:27:02,080 --> 00:27:03,919
the only secure software

736
00:27:03,919 --> 00:27:06,640
the only completely secure software that

737
00:27:06,640 --> 00:27:08,000
you know is one that actually probably

738
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:10,000
has no code in it so

739
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:12,080
you know it's uh it's deciding

740
00:27:12,080 --> 00:27:14,159
those things are always about risk

741
00:27:14,159 --> 00:27:17,200
versus versus resource aren't they

742
00:27:17,200 --> 00:27:21,080
exactly yes

743
00:27:22,640 --> 00:27:25,120
i think that was the only question on

744
00:27:25,120 --> 00:27:28,879
the talk um so

745
00:27:33,120 --> 00:27:35,440
thank you

746
00:27:35,440 --> 00:27:37,200
well thank you thank you i don't know

747
00:27:37,200 --> 00:27:39,200
what's going on with your audio sounds

748
00:27:39,200 --> 00:27:43,120
terrible to me maybe is it just me

749
00:27:46,559 --> 00:27:48,880
yes okay it sounds like you're in slow

750
00:27:48,880 --> 00:27:50,640
motion at the minute

751
00:27:50,640 --> 00:27:52,240
let's try disconnecting the audio and

752
00:27:52,240 --> 00:27:55,200
reconnect it again

753
00:27:56,640 --> 00:27:58,000
so thank you very much for joining us

754
00:27:58,000 --> 00:27:59,600
anyway either that was uh that was a

755
00:27:59,600 --> 00:28:02,159
really good talk i i very much enjoyed
