00:01:11,360 --> 00:01:13,280
is my career i happen to be in

32
00:01:13,280 --> 00:01:14,640
information security right now

33
00:01:14,640 --> 00:01:16,960
specifically application security

34
00:01:16,960 --> 00:01:20,320
uh but i really you know my passion is

35
00:01:20,320 --> 00:01:22,240
around development and you know it's

36
00:01:22,240 --> 00:01:23,840
funny that uh

37
00:01:23,840 --> 00:01:25,680
in security it's often

38
00:01:25,680 --> 00:01:27,520
not about the tech it's usually about

39
00:01:27,520 --> 00:01:29,680
people in process as same as it is in

40
00:01:29,680 --> 00:01:30,960
development

41
00:01:30,960 --> 00:01:32,560
so i want to talk to you a little bit

42
00:01:32,560 --> 00:01:34,240
about that today

43
00:01:34,240 --> 00:01:36,320
a little bit about check marks uh we are

44
00:01:36,320 --> 00:01:39,360
an application security company

45
00:01:39,360 --> 00:01:43,119
the finding the fixing the preventing

46
00:01:43,119 --> 00:01:45,360
looking at your applications which have

47
00:01:45,360 --> 00:01:47,280
changed over the last

48
00:01:47,280 --> 00:01:49,600
15 20 years the definition of an

49
00:01:49,600 --> 00:01:51,759
application has just grown

50
00:01:51,759 --> 00:01:53,439
and exploded the number of things that

51
00:01:53,439 --> 00:01:55,119
developers need to be aware of and

52
00:01:55,119 --> 00:01:57,759
security professionals need to train on

53
00:01:57,759 --> 00:02:01,200
it continues to expand

54
00:02:02,479 --> 00:02:04,399
of course one of the things

55
00:02:04,399 --> 00:02:07,360
that i think about with development

56
00:02:07,360 --> 00:02:08,959
is hygiene

57
00:02:08,959 --> 00:02:10,720
but not

58
00:02:10,720 --> 00:02:12,879
as was suggested in the talk

59
00:02:12,879 --> 00:02:14,640
uh the kind of you know i've been up all

60
00:02:14,640 --> 00:02:16,400
night which i have done

61
00:02:16,400 --> 00:02:18,400
uh and been

62
00:02:18,400 --> 00:02:19,200
at

63
00:02:19,200 --> 00:02:21,200
at the computer working hard on a

64
00:02:21,200 --> 00:02:22,560
problem

65
00:02:22,560 --> 00:02:24,239
sometimes in the office sometimes at

66
00:02:24,239 --> 00:02:25,280
home

67
00:02:25,280 --> 00:02:27,760
it's more for me

68
00:02:27,760 --> 00:02:31,680
about how we think about our process

69
00:02:31,680 --> 00:02:35,680
and how we think about getting better

70
00:02:35,680 --> 00:02:38,160
do we have good habits

71
00:02:38,160 --> 00:02:41,519
around how we create the software uh

72
00:02:41,519 --> 00:02:44,959
that we're we're paid to build

73
00:02:47,040 --> 00:02:49,599
now i'll start this talk

74
00:02:49,599 --> 00:02:51,440
with feedback

75
00:02:51,440 --> 00:02:52,319
and

76
00:02:52,319 --> 00:02:54,400
this is a bit of a cheeky talk as you

77
00:02:54,400 --> 00:02:56,640
can see by the title

78
00:02:56,640 --> 00:02:59,599
but you know feedback is a gift

79
00:02:59,599 --> 00:03:02,080
if you choose to take it that way and

80
00:03:02,080 --> 00:03:03,519
you know i've given a lot of talks

81
00:03:03,519 --> 00:03:05,920
around around feedback and one of the

82
00:03:05,920 --> 00:03:08,239
keys here is that

83
00:03:08,239 --> 00:03:09,840
you should ask

84
00:03:09,840 --> 00:03:10,560
so

85
00:03:10,560 --> 00:03:13,519
i'll ask you to be receptive of this

86
00:03:13,519 --> 00:03:16,480
feedback and not take it

87
00:03:16,480 --> 00:03:17,760
the wrong way

88
00:03:17,760 --> 00:03:19,760
it's not meant to be

89
00:03:19,760 --> 00:03:20,800
a weapon

90
00:03:20,800 --> 00:03:23,280
it's not meant to hit you on the nose

91
00:03:23,280 --> 00:03:24,959
with

92
00:03:24,959 --> 00:03:26,560
because

93
00:03:26,560 --> 00:03:28,720
we can only get better if we understand

94
00:03:28,720 --> 00:03:31,200
the things we're deficient in

95
00:03:31,200 --> 00:03:33,200
and those are very hard sometimes to

96
00:03:33,200 --> 00:03:34,879
look in the mirror and say yeah i'm not

97
00:03:34,879 --> 00:03:37,120
my best self or i didn't do my best job

98
00:03:37,120 --> 00:03:38,319
here

99
00:03:38,319 --> 00:03:40,799
so you know this is meant

100
00:03:40,799 --> 00:03:42,799
this entire talk is meant to to really

101
00:03:42,799 --> 00:03:44,879
take a look at ourselves

102
00:03:44,879 --> 00:03:46,560
uh how we do business

103
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:47,920
and whether or not those are the right

104
00:03:47,920 --> 00:03:51,518
things that we should be pursuing

105
00:03:54,480 --> 00:03:56,000
critical to

106
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:58,319
improvement

107
00:03:58,319 --> 00:04:01,760
is to be able to take a step outside

108
00:04:01,760 --> 00:04:03,519
you know if you've been in your company

109
00:04:03,519 --> 00:04:06,159
for a long time i've been in a company

110
00:04:06,159 --> 00:04:07,599
as long as

111
00:04:07,599 --> 00:04:09,680
12 and a half years

112
00:04:09,680 --> 00:04:12,159
and it's very hard to look at what you

113
00:04:12,159 --> 00:04:14,319
do on a daily basis and understand

114
00:04:14,319 --> 00:04:15,599
whether or not

115
00:04:15,599 --> 00:04:17,279
those are still the things that you

116
00:04:17,279 --> 00:04:18,639
should be doing

117
00:04:18,639 --> 00:04:20,160
uh you know

118
00:04:20,160 --> 00:04:22,720
the traditions that you build up the

119
00:04:22,720 --> 00:04:25,040
norms that you build up in a company

120
00:04:25,040 --> 00:04:27,520
even if they were right at some point in

121
00:04:27,520 --> 00:04:29,360
time

122
00:04:29,360 --> 00:04:31,759
the the old saying what got you here

123
00:04:31,759 --> 00:04:34,800
won't get you there is absolutely true

124
00:04:34,800 --> 00:04:36,639
so to be able to

125
00:04:36,639 --> 00:04:37,440
look

126
00:04:37,440 --> 00:04:39,520
critically and sometimes this requires a

127
00:04:39,520 --> 00:04:40,560
friend

128
00:04:40,560 --> 00:04:42,960
someone from the outside maybe even uh

129
00:04:42,960 --> 00:04:44,479
someone that you hire to come in and

130
00:04:44,479 --> 00:04:47,520
have a look let's inspect what we do

131
00:04:47,520 --> 00:04:51,040
and let's be clear-eyed about this

132
00:04:51,040 --> 00:04:55,960
so we'll start by looking in the mirror

133
00:04:57,840 --> 00:04:59,680
what do you think of your own

134
00:04:59,680 --> 00:05:01,840
capabilities your team's capabilities

135
00:05:01,840 --> 00:05:04,800
your company's capabilities

136
00:05:04,800 --> 00:05:06,400
uh are you

137
00:05:06,400 --> 00:05:07,759
honest

138
00:05:07,759 --> 00:05:09,199
with each other

139
00:05:09,199 --> 00:05:10,720
and with yourself

140
00:05:10,720 --> 00:05:13,280
around what you can accomplish and what

141
00:05:13,280 --> 00:05:14,720
you can't

142
00:05:14,720 --> 00:05:17,360
and it's okay to be deficient in

143
00:05:17,360 --> 00:05:20,800
something it's okay to struggle

144
00:05:20,800 --> 00:05:22,840
but it's really not

145
00:05:22,840 --> 00:05:25,280
okay for you to

146
00:05:25,280 --> 00:05:26,800
uh have this

147
00:05:26,800 --> 00:05:28,800
fake image of yourself where yeah i'm a

148
00:05:28,800 --> 00:05:30,960
superman we could do anything don't

149
00:05:30,960 --> 00:05:32,560
worry about it

150
00:05:32,560 --> 00:05:35,039
that doesn't lead to good outcomes

151
00:05:35,039 --> 00:05:36,840
and if you look at the goals that you

152
00:05:36,840 --> 00:05:39,440
have for your sprints for instance if we

153
00:05:39,440 --> 00:05:41,039
take a look at a sprint

154
00:05:41,039 --> 00:05:43,840
do you do stories in stories out

155
00:05:43,840 --> 00:05:45,600
are you completing the definition of

156
00:05:45,600 --> 00:05:46,720
done

157
00:05:46,720 --> 00:05:47,919
are you

158
00:05:47,919 --> 00:05:49,759
really looking critically

159
00:05:49,759 --> 00:05:50,800
in

160
00:05:50,800 --> 00:05:53,280
your retros to say hey

161
00:05:53,280 --> 00:05:54,800
how could we be better what really

162
00:05:54,800 --> 00:05:56,400
didn't go right

163
00:05:56,400 --> 00:05:58,080
instead of being you know about patting

164
00:05:58,080 --> 00:06:01,120
yourself on the back

165
00:06:03,680 --> 00:06:04,960
key to

166
00:06:04,960 --> 00:06:07,759
software development

167
00:06:07,759 --> 00:06:09,840
is to build muscle

168
00:06:09,840 --> 00:06:12,400
in the right areas so i i coached

169
00:06:12,400 --> 00:06:15,120
soccer for 15 years from the time my

170
00:06:15,120 --> 00:06:17,680
children were four years old until

171
00:06:17,680 --> 00:06:19,440
they were a freshman in college and

172
00:06:19,440 --> 00:06:22,240
turning 19.

173
00:06:22,240 --> 00:06:23,840
the the

174
00:06:23,840 --> 00:06:25,600
key to

175
00:06:25,600 --> 00:06:27,759
soccer coaching

176
00:06:27,759 --> 00:06:29,600
is

177
00:06:29,600 --> 00:06:31,919
that you need every practice to look

178
00:06:31,919 --> 00:06:33,600
like a game

179
00:06:33,600 --> 00:06:35,360
the pieces of the game it's not the

180
00:06:35,360 --> 00:06:38,000
entire game but pieces and parts of this

181
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:40,319
oftentimes i would see

182
00:06:40,319 --> 00:06:43,039
coaches taking their kids up to hills

183
00:06:43,039 --> 00:06:45,919
and running up and down hills or running

184
00:06:45,919 --> 00:06:49,120
in the bleachers

185
00:06:49,120 --> 00:06:51,840
but i can tell you from

186
00:06:51,840 --> 00:06:53,840
seeing lots of soccer i've never seen it

187
00:06:53,840 --> 00:06:55,680
playing on a hill

188
00:06:55,680 --> 00:06:57,120
i've never seen it played in the

189
00:06:57,120 --> 00:06:58,240
bleachers

190
00:06:58,240 --> 00:07:00,880
so my question to them is

191
00:07:00,880 --> 00:07:03,599
what muscles are you building for those

192
00:07:03,599 --> 00:07:05,919
children right now and how will that

193
00:07:05,919 --> 00:07:08,000
help you in the game no doubt

194
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:09,759
you're building some endurance and

195
00:07:09,759 --> 00:07:12,080
they're building some muscle

196
00:07:12,080 --> 00:07:14,318
but

197
00:07:14,479 --> 00:07:16,560
if you don't make it look like the game

198
00:07:16,560 --> 00:07:18,160
then those muscles aren't going to help

199
00:07:18,160 --> 00:07:21,039
you in that context

200
00:07:21,039 --> 00:07:24,400
so think about that in in in this case

201
00:07:24,400 --> 00:07:26,000
uh you know are we

202
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:27,840
are our lower environments

203
00:07:27,840 --> 00:07:29,120
uh our

204
00:07:29,120 --> 00:07:34,160
development our quality staging uat etc

205
00:07:34,160 --> 00:07:36,960
are those done exactly the same way that

206
00:07:36,960 --> 00:07:38,880
you do production

207
00:07:38,880 --> 00:07:40,720
because if they're not then i would ask

208
00:07:40,720 --> 00:07:42,560
you what are you actually testing and

209
00:07:42,560 --> 00:07:45,680
what value does that testing provide

210
00:07:45,680 --> 00:07:49,039
and if we talk and lean into testing now

211
00:07:49,039 --> 00:07:53,520
and this is less true in devops

212
00:07:53,520 --> 00:07:54,960
when you think about test driven

213
00:07:54,960 --> 00:07:58,160
development definition of done

214
00:07:58,160 --> 00:08:00,080
teams tend to be

215
00:08:00,080 --> 00:08:02,560
better these days than in the past

216
00:08:02,560 --> 00:08:05,039
around their testing habits from a

217
00:08:05,039 --> 00:08:07,599
functional perspective

218
00:08:07,599 --> 00:08:11,599
but if you look at security specifically

219
00:08:11,599 --> 00:08:14,720
when are you testing for security

220
00:08:14,720 --> 00:08:17,520
are you bolting the engine on the plane

221
00:08:17,520 --> 00:08:19,520
and saying hey what could possibly go

222
00:08:19,520 --> 00:08:21,280
wrong

223
00:08:21,280 --> 00:08:23,199
well that i mean that is a way to test

224
00:08:23,199 --> 00:08:25,280
but understand that

225
00:08:25,280 --> 00:08:27,919
when you do it that way

226
00:08:27,919 --> 00:08:29,360
you're finding a whole bunch of things

227
00:08:29,360 --> 00:08:31,199
at a time when you're really not capable

228
00:08:31,199 --> 00:08:32,880
of dealing with them

229
00:08:32,880 --> 00:08:34,080
and

230
00:08:34,080 --> 00:08:35,519
now what

231
00:08:35,519 --> 00:08:37,679
now what are we going to do

232
00:08:37,679 --> 00:08:39,200
so

233
00:08:39,200 --> 00:08:40,399
the the

234
00:08:40,399 --> 00:08:42,880
theory and the thinking around testing

235
00:08:42,880 --> 00:08:44,560
no matter whether it's functional

236
00:08:44,560 --> 00:08:46,000
requirements or non-functional

237
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:47,519
requirements

238
00:08:47,519 --> 00:08:49,519
if you look at you know toyota

239
00:08:49,519 --> 00:08:51,360
production system was the earliest we

240
00:08:51,360 --> 00:08:52,720
could have found this how could we have

241
00:08:52,720 --> 00:08:55,040
prevented this uh

242
00:08:55,040 --> 00:08:57,920
can i can i find a way to find this

243
00:08:57,920 --> 00:09:01,360
earlier to take risk out of my story

244
00:09:01,360 --> 00:09:03,120
such that i can deliver it during my

245
00:09:03,120 --> 00:09:05,519
sprint

246
00:09:06,240 --> 00:09:10,240
so when we test late what happens

247
00:09:10,240 --> 00:09:13,040
uh no one fixes everything that they

248
00:09:13,040 --> 00:09:16,240
find that includes quality too i've been

249
00:09:16,240 --> 00:09:18,880
shipping software for a very long time

250
00:09:18,880 --> 00:09:19,760
and

251
00:09:19,760 --> 00:09:21,279
i know that

252
00:09:21,279 --> 00:09:23,600
quality bugs leave

253
00:09:23,600 --> 00:09:25,680
this is good enough this is close enough

254
00:09:25,680 --> 00:09:28,560
it's time we need to ship

255
00:09:28,560 --> 00:09:29,920
but

256
00:09:29,920 --> 00:09:31,760
if you think about

257
00:09:31,760 --> 00:09:34,560
how you test what you test for

258
00:09:34,560 --> 00:09:38,800
and what your capabilities are

259
00:09:38,880 --> 00:09:41,519
are you testing for too much so in

260
00:09:41,519 --> 00:09:42,800
security

261
00:09:42,800 --> 00:09:44,800
you could look for every security

262
00:09:44,800 --> 00:09:46,399
vulnerability

263
00:09:46,399 --> 00:09:48,800
that the security tooling could find

264
00:09:48,800 --> 00:09:50,399
across all of the different areas so you

265
00:09:50,399 --> 00:09:52,240
think about infrastructure's code

266
00:09:52,240 --> 00:09:54,880
containers api

267
00:09:54,880 --> 00:09:56,560
you think about your static analysis

268
00:09:56,560 --> 00:09:58,240
dynamic analysis

269
00:09:58,240 --> 00:09:59,760
those can find

270
00:09:59,760 --> 00:10:02,640
thousands of problems in your code and

271
00:10:02,640 --> 00:10:04,800
the question is and this is to the

272
00:10:04,800 --> 00:10:06,480
security people as well what is your

273
00:10:06,480 --> 00:10:09,519
policy i often talk to people about

274
00:10:09,519 --> 00:10:11,360
their security scanning and their

275
00:10:11,360 --> 00:10:12,880
security policies and what they say is

276
00:10:12,880 --> 00:10:16,839
well you know we want to fix everything

277
00:10:16,839 --> 00:10:20,079
and then if i ask them well what are you

278
00:10:20,079 --> 00:10:21,200
fixing

279
00:10:21,200 --> 00:10:23,680
well we'd like to get to

280
00:10:23,680 --> 00:10:26,720
half of the highs by the end of the year

281
00:10:26,720 --> 00:10:28,480
which means that we spend a great deal

282
00:10:28,480 --> 00:10:30,640
of time looking at things that we're not

283
00:10:30,640 --> 00:10:32,880
going to fix looking at things that

284
00:10:32,880 --> 00:10:36,000
frankly we're not capable of fixing so

285
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:38,560
if you're scanning for everything but

286
00:10:38,560 --> 00:10:41,680
only able to fix a small fraction

287
00:10:41,680 --> 00:10:43,040
well it doesn't mean that you don't want

288
00:10:43,040 --> 00:10:44,720
to fix those things but if you're not

289
00:10:44,720 --> 00:10:46,320
capable of it then you end up bailing

290
00:10:46,320 --> 00:10:47,760
these things up

291
00:10:47,760 --> 00:10:49,680
at the end of the release talking about

292
00:10:49,680 --> 00:10:52,240
those exception processes and making

293
00:10:52,240 --> 00:10:53,680
sure that you can push this thing out to

294
00:10:53,680 --> 00:10:55,279
production

295
00:10:55,279 --> 00:10:57,040
and then if you look at

296
00:10:57,040 --> 00:11:01,040
your aggregated tech debt

297
00:11:01,120 --> 00:11:03,519
it's not a pretty picture

298
00:11:03,519 --> 00:11:05,200
you end up with

299
00:11:05,200 --> 00:11:07,680
a jira backlog

300
00:11:07,680 --> 00:11:12,079
full of vulnerabilities that and flaws

301
00:11:12,079 --> 00:11:13,519
that frankly

302
00:11:13,519 --> 00:11:15,920
you're probably never going to fix

303
00:11:15,920 --> 00:11:18,480
and you know i remember as scrum master

304
00:11:18,480 --> 00:11:20,000
as team lead

305
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:21,839
going back through those

306
00:11:21,839 --> 00:11:23,760
once or twice a year

307
00:11:23,760 --> 00:11:26,560
and just truing up with myself

308
00:11:26,560 --> 00:11:28,640
saying this isn't going to get fixed we

309
00:11:28,640 --> 00:11:30,320
need to push this out we need to get rid

310
00:11:30,320 --> 00:11:32,079
of this we need to say

311
00:11:32,079 --> 00:11:34,880
we need to say this won't be fixed

312
00:11:34,880 --> 00:11:36,800
so if you think about what you test for

313
00:11:36,800 --> 00:11:38,880
and your capabilities those should line

314
00:11:38,880 --> 00:11:42,800
up closely it's okay to lean over the

315
00:11:42,800 --> 00:11:45,360
line and say hey we're only able to fix

316
00:11:45,360 --> 00:11:47,360
highs so we're going to do highs and

317
00:11:47,360 --> 00:11:49,200
mediums or some portion of those mediums

318
00:11:49,200 --> 00:11:50,399
we're going to start to keep track of

319
00:11:50,399 --> 00:11:52,160
those and measure those we're going to

320
00:11:52,160 --> 00:11:53,680
start to build out our practices on how

321
00:11:53,680 --> 00:11:54,959
we get better

322
00:11:54,959 --> 00:11:56,959
because what's inevitably going to

323
00:11:56,959 --> 00:11:57,839
happen

324
00:11:57,839 --> 00:12:01,360
is something like log for j

325
00:12:01,360 --> 00:12:03,839
and in that case

326
00:12:03,839 --> 00:12:05,200
because

327
00:12:05,200 --> 00:12:07,040
people didn't have

328
00:12:07,040 --> 00:12:09,120
the right muscles built

329
00:12:09,120 --> 00:12:12,880
around incident response

330
00:12:13,519 --> 00:12:15,600
all of your development was upended he

331
00:12:15,600 --> 00:12:18,320
said okay everybody stop

332
00:12:18,320 --> 00:12:20,560
let's look for

333
00:12:20,560 --> 00:12:22,320
what we have here

334
00:12:22,320 --> 00:12:24,399
and in the case of uh someone running

335
00:12:24,399 --> 00:12:25,839
this incident

336
00:12:25,839 --> 00:12:26,800
uh

337
00:12:26,800 --> 00:12:28,639
as the lead of appsec so i used to run

338
00:12:28,639 --> 00:12:30,000
application security for the bank of

339
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:32,160
montreal and i was responsible for uh

340
00:12:32,160 --> 00:12:34,480
over 2000 applications

341
00:12:34,480 --> 00:12:36,560
i would have to say all right let me

342
00:12:36,560 --> 00:12:37,920
look at the entire list of all the

343
00:12:37,920 --> 00:12:39,920
applications i have i need to break

344
00:12:39,920 --> 00:12:42,240
these into three different lists things

345
00:12:42,240 --> 00:12:44,560
that i know are vulnerable things that i

346
00:12:44,560 --> 00:12:46,720
know are not vulnerable and things i'm

347
00:12:46,720 --> 00:12:48,560
not sure about yet

348
00:12:48,560 --> 00:12:50,079
and then eventually you have to work

349
00:12:50,079 --> 00:12:52,720
those lists down to everything's not

350
00:12:52,720 --> 00:12:56,320
vulnerable to end this incident response

351
00:12:56,320 --> 00:12:58,959
so you're going to teams asking them do

352
00:12:58,959 --> 00:13:00,880
they have this version of

353
00:13:00,880 --> 00:13:02,079
uh

354
00:13:02,079 --> 00:13:04,000
of the software

355
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:05,760
and what are they capable of doing in

356
00:13:05,760 --> 00:13:07,120
that case

357
00:13:07,120 --> 00:13:08,399
uh

358
00:13:08,399 --> 00:13:10,800
but because we didn't have good hygiene

359
00:13:10,800 --> 00:13:12,240
habits around

360
00:13:12,240 --> 00:13:15,519
uh being able to upgrade our software uh

361
00:13:15,519 --> 00:13:16,800
these became very difficult

362
00:13:16,800 --> 00:13:19,920
conversations and and i know from uh

363
00:13:19,920 --> 00:13:21,839
experience and talking to my peers

364
00:13:21,839 --> 00:13:24,639
sometimes in the in uh months we're

365
00:13:24,639 --> 00:13:27,120
measuring these on calendars and that is

366
00:13:27,120 --> 00:13:28,639
not devops

367
00:13:28,639 --> 00:13:30,639
that is not agile

368
00:13:30,639 --> 00:13:31,519
so

369
00:13:31,519 --> 00:13:33,360
let's take a look at this and understand

370
00:13:33,360 --> 00:13:34,639
why

371
00:13:34,639 --> 00:13:36,079
now of course

372
00:13:36,079 --> 00:13:38,000
uh from a security perspective i look at

373
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:39,920
open source and i and i think about this

374
00:13:39,920 --> 00:13:40,800
as

375
00:13:40,800 --> 00:13:44,320
one of the scariest places for a company

376
00:13:44,320 --> 00:13:46,480
and that's because if you're in a

377
00:13:46,480 --> 00:13:49,040
company that has a security practice

378
00:13:49,040 --> 00:13:51,040
there are controls around your first and

379
00:13:51,040 --> 00:13:53,440
second party software

380
00:13:53,440 --> 00:13:57,040
that holds you to account for some level

381
00:13:57,040 --> 00:13:59,360
of standards so we have scanning we look

382
00:13:59,360 --> 00:14:00,800
at it here are the vulnerabilities

383
00:14:00,800 --> 00:14:02,000
here's what you're supposed to fix now

384
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:03,600
whether you fix them or not

385
00:14:03,600 --> 00:14:06,000
we are at least aware of them

386
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:08,079
we vet the employees that we bring into

387
00:14:08,079 --> 00:14:09,279
the company

388
00:14:09,279 --> 00:14:11,199
in the case of open source

389
00:14:11,199 --> 00:14:12,720
that's not the case

390
00:14:12,720 --> 00:14:14,800
i didn't hire these people

391
00:14:14,800 --> 00:14:17,839
we don't scan their software in the same

392
00:14:17,839 --> 00:14:19,680
way

393
00:14:19,680 --> 00:14:21,279
and these things get brought in to build

394
00:14:21,279 --> 00:14:23,839
our applications and it accounts for 80

395
00:14:23,839 --> 00:14:26,480
to 95 percent of the software that we

396
00:14:26,480 --> 00:14:27,360
ship

397
00:14:27,360 --> 00:14:29,600
which is extremely scary for a security

398
00:14:29,600 --> 00:14:31,519
professional because i don't have

399
00:14:31,519 --> 00:14:33,519
controls around that

400
00:14:33,519 --> 00:14:35,839
and when we think about

401
00:14:35,839 --> 00:14:37,600
open source

402
00:14:37,600 --> 00:14:41,279
we consider it a free lunch

403
00:14:41,360 --> 00:14:43,920
i i take it in i use it and i don't have

404
00:14:43,920 --> 00:14:45,920
to worry about it

405
00:14:45,920 --> 00:14:47,440
but

406
00:14:47,440 --> 00:14:49,440
open source is really more like a free

407
00:14:49,440 --> 00:14:50,480
puppy

408
00:14:50,480 --> 00:14:53,440
when i decide to use an open source

409
00:14:53,440 --> 00:14:55,360
library

410
00:14:55,360 --> 00:14:58,720
i can i now take on some responsibility

411
00:14:58,720 --> 00:15:00,959
to my company

412
00:15:00,959 --> 00:15:02,480
and that's both from the development

413
00:15:02,480 --> 00:15:03,680
point of view and from the security

414
00:15:03,680 --> 00:15:05,839
point of view to give it care and

415
00:15:05,839 --> 00:15:07,040
feeding

416
00:15:07,040 --> 00:15:09,120
now you don't have to do that but you

417
00:15:09,120 --> 00:15:11,680
know that's animal cruelty

418
00:15:11,680 --> 00:15:13,839
we have to think about

419
00:15:13,839 --> 00:15:16,000
what responsibilities we take on when we

420
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:18,160
use this software

421
00:15:18,160 --> 00:15:19,360
and

422
00:15:19,360 --> 00:15:21,920
as a developer i know because i've done

423
00:15:21,920 --> 00:15:22,880
it

424
00:15:22,880 --> 00:15:24,560
we integrate and abandon

425
00:15:24,560 --> 00:15:26,880
it does what i need it to do

426
00:15:26,880 --> 00:15:29,199
so i don't need to look back

427
00:15:29,199 --> 00:15:31,600
i can say hey job done

428
00:15:31,600 --> 00:15:33,920
product functions i have important

429
00:15:33,920 --> 00:15:35,920
things to do i've got a huge backlog of

430
00:15:35,920 --> 00:15:38,240
stuff to get after

431
00:15:38,240 --> 00:15:41,920
and tech debt is not top of my concern

432
00:15:41,920 --> 00:15:44,079
because this library

433
00:15:44,079 --> 00:15:46,639
it it works

434
00:15:46,639 --> 00:15:48,240
but

435
00:15:48,240 --> 00:15:51,120
this software continues to grow and

436
00:15:51,120 --> 00:15:53,360
change and mature

437
00:15:53,360 --> 00:15:56,079
in ways that

438
00:15:56,079 --> 00:15:58,240
are sometimes good

439
00:15:58,240 --> 00:16:01,519
sometimes require a great deal of change

440
00:16:01,519 --> 00:16:03,199
uh if you think about

441
00:16:03,199 --> 00:16:04,959
uh

442
00:16:04,959 --> 00:16:07,440
it's for instance s3 buckets

443
00:16:07,440 --> 00:16:08,959
uh

444
00:16:08,959 --> 00:16:10,880
when those were created amazon really

445
00:16:10,880 --> 00:16:13,759
had no idea how they would be utilized

446
00:16:13,759 --> 00:16:15,279
what kind of configurations were

447
00:16:15,279 --> 00:16:17,279
necessary developers got in there

448
00:16:17,279 --> 00:16:18,639
started pulling it back and saying oh

449
00:16:18,639 --> 00:16:20,480
look at all the cool things i can do the

450
00:16:20,480 --> 00:16:23,040
same is true of any of this software out

451
00:16:23,040 --> 00:16:25,360
there in the open source community

452
00:16:25,360 --> 00:16:27,680
we find new and novel ways to make use

453
00:16:27,680 --> 00:16:30,639
of it now sometimes we're going to find

454
00:16:30,639 --> 00:16:32,240
vulnerabilities have been in that code

455
00:16:32,240 --> 00:16:33,920
since day one

456
00:16:33,920 --> 00:16:35,519
zero days

457
00:16:35,519 --> 00:16:38,000
and we're gonna say oh we need to make a

458
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:40,320
change now it's not to say that you know

459
00:16:40,320 --> 00:16:43,199
that as we use this software these

460
00:16:43,199 --> 00:16:45,920
things uh come to light over time

461
00:16:45,920 --> 00:16:49,040
sometimes decade or more that this

462
00:16:49,040 --> 00:16:52,240
vulnerability has been in there

463
00:16:52,240 --> 00:16:54,880
so there are ramifications to that where

464
00:16:54,880 --> 00:16:56,480
i'm going to want to upgrade this but

465
00:16:56,480 --> 00:16:59,040
also as this software changes so if i go

466
00:16:59,040 --> 00:17:01,199
from you know a version 1 to a version 3

467
00:17:01,199 --> 00:17:04,000
or version 4 it may change the way i

468
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:06,319
have to package my application it may

469
00:17:06,319 --> 00:17:07,599
change the way i have to do

470
00:17:07,599 --> 00:17:10,000
authentication apis may have been

471
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:11,599
updated so

472
00:17:11,599 --> 00:17:12,799
when i go

473
00:17:12,799 --> 00:17:15,760
to upgrade these they may be a big

474
00:17:15,760 --> 00:17:18,760
change

475
00:17:19,119 --> 00:17:20,959
and in these kind of incidents if you

476
00:17:20,959 --> 00:17:21,839
were

477
00:17:21,839 --> 00:17:23,599
writing java software

478
00:17:23,599 --> 00:17:26,880
at the end of last year you know

479
00:17:26,880 --> 00:17:28,079
that you're under a great deal of

480
00:17:28,079 --> 00:17:29,679
pressure

481
00:17:29,679 --> 00:17:33,360
the business is in jeopardy these uh

482
00:17:33,360 --> 00:17:36,080
there are attacks going on presently and

483
00:17:36,080 --> 00:17:38,080
we're afraid of them

484
00:17:38,080 --> 00:17:40,640
and we need to get it done so we're

485
00:17:40,640 --> 00:17:42,960
going to the team we're saying

486
00:17:42,960 --> 00:17:44,640
you have this vulnerability we need you

487
00:17:44,640 --> 00:17:48,320
to upgrade uh when can you get it done

488
00:17:48,320 --> 00:17:50,799
and that kind of constant pressure as an

489
00:17:50,799 --> 00:17:52,400
incident response

490
00:17:52,400 --> 00:17:53,600
uh leader

491
00:17:53,600 --> 00:17:55,679
i would have been in a daily meeting

492
00:17:55,679 --> 00:17:56,480
with

493
00:17:56,480 --> 00:18:00,320
our cso to talk about where we were what

494
00:18:00,320 --> 00:18:02,559
progress was being made where i'm being

495
00:18:02,559 --> 00:18:03,600
blocked

496
00:18:03,600 --> 00:18:06,240
the help that i need and then after that

497
00:18:06,240 --> 00:18:08,240
meeting the rest of the day would be in

498
00:18:08,240 --> 00:18:09,919
phone calls and meetings to go back to

499
00:18:09,919 --> 00:18:11,440
those teams and understand where we are

500
00:18:11,440 --> 00:18:13,440
and what we're going to do and how

501
00:18:13,440 --> 00:18:15,520
they're being delayed or what kind of

502
00:18:15,520 --> 00:18:17,200
problems they're having

503
00:18:17,200 --> 00:18:19,360
so that is not a productive environment

504
00:18:19,360 --> 00:18:22,719
that is not a place where

505
00:18:23,360 --> 00:18:26,000
doing things that are normal

506
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:28,080
if it's an abnormal act if it's

507
00:18:28,080 --> 00:18:30,080
something i haven't done frequently

508
00:18:30,080 --> 00:18:31,919
which is for the reason for this talk if

509
00:18:31,919 --> 00:18:34,720
i don't do it regularly it becomes an

510
00:18:34,720 --> 00:18:37,120
unnatural act under pressure which is

511
00:18:37,120 --> 00:18:40,240
not a great way to to get things done

512
00:18:40,240 --> 00:18:42,960
so there's a continuum of how you might

513
00:18:42,960 --> 00:18:45,360
experience this from the easy button

514
00:18:45,360 --> 00:18:48,000
all the way over to you know it up ends

515
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:50,720
everything and all work stops uh

516
00:18:50,720 --> 00:18:52,480
releases are delayed

517
00:18:52,480 --> 00:18:54,880
um bug fixes don't happen

518
00:18:54,880 --> 00:18:57,280
uh in in the case of this particular one

519
00:18:57,280 --> 00:18:59,840
uh log4j was released several times

520
00:18:59,840 --> 00:19:00,960
where it's like hey we need you to

521
00:19:00,960 --> 00:19:02,559
upgrade to the oh wait no that didn't

522
00:19:02,559 --> 00:19:05,039
work okay let's go to this next oh no

523
00:19:05,039 --> 00:19:07,280
that's not the one okay here's the real

524
00:19:07,280 --> 00:19:09,200
one there were also ways to mitigate

525
00:19:09,200 --> 00:19:10,720
these vulnerabilities so there was a lot

526
00:19:10,720 --> 00:19:13,360
of churn and change happening at the

527
00:19:13,360 --> 00:19:14,799
same time

528
00:19:14,799 --> 00:19:16,320
and again if you're not

529
00:19:16,320 --> 00:19:18,720
used to making these changes then these

530
00:19:18,720 --> 00:19:23,640
are very impactful to your program

531
00:19:25,280 --> 00:19:26,320
so

532
00:19:26,320 --> 00:19:28,240
what can we do about this problem how do

533
00:19:28,240 --> 00:19:29,760
we think how can we think about this in

534
00:19:29,760 --> 00:19:32,640
a different way that allows us to

535
00:19:32,640 --> 00:19:34,000
lean into

536
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:36,080
uh good practices

537
00:19:36,080 --> 00:19:38,080
that allow these to become normal

538
00:19:38,080 --> 00:19:39,760
occurrences

539
00:19:39,760 --> 00:19:42,000
in the first one which is going to be

540
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:44,880
typical for i hope for our audience here

541
00:19:44,880 --> 00:19:46,960
if you think about agile if you think

542
00:19:46,960 --> 00:19:50,080
about devops devsecops

543
00:19:50,080 --> 00:19:51,919
having that learning culture that

544
00:19:51,919 --> 00:19:54,640
continuous improvement

545
00:19:54,640 --> 00:19:57,440
always being constructively dissatisfied

546
00:19:57,440 --> 00:19:59,600
with where you are hey we're very happy

547
00:19:59,600 --> 00:20:01,840
with where we are but we want to be here

548
00:20:01,840 --> 00:20:04,000
and i want to go in that direction

549
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:05,520
understanding that

550
00:20:05,520 --> 00:20:08,159
failure is an opportunity to learn

551
00:20:08,159 --> 00:20:10,080
and not a time for us to have a witch

552
00:20:10,080 --> 00:20:10,960
hunt

553
00:20:10,960 --> 00:20:12,640
these are the things that i want to be

554
00:20:12,640 --> 00:20:15,039
baked into my company's culture and my

555
00:20:15,039 --> 00:20:17,520
team's culture and if that is not the

556
00:20:17,520 --> 00:20:19,520
world that you live in this should be

557
00:20:19,520 --> 00:20:22,080
job one of saying hey we're here to

558
00:20:22,080 --> 00:20:23,600
learn we're here to get better i can't

559
00:20:23,600 --> 00:20:27,120
know everything uh and and as we go

560
00:20:27,120 --> 00:20:29,440
we need to understand that failure is

561
00:20:29,440 --> 00:20:31,120
absolutely an option

562
00:20:31,120 --> 00:20:33,280
uh and we're going to learn from it and

563
00:20:33,280 --> 00:20:36,158
get better at it

564
00:20:36,720 --> 00:20:40,240
as you think about technical debt

565
00:20:40,240 --> 00:20:42,480
oftentimes this is the last thing that

566
00:20:42,480 --> 00:20:44,400
gets considered

567
00:20:44,400 --> 00:20:47,120
you have a giant backlog of work

568
00:20:47,120 --> 00:20:48,960
and a constant pressure from the

569
00:20:48,960 --> 00:20:51,919
business to deliver on that backlog to

570
00:20:51,919 --> 00:20:54,080
bring out new functionality

571
00:20:54,080 --> 00:20:55,280
to

572
00:20:55,280 --> 00:20:57,679
move the business forward to enable

573
00:20:57,679 --> 00:21:00,880
customers to enable sales to make

574
00:21:00,880 --> 00:21:02,480
money for the company

575
00:21:02,480 --> 00:21:05,280
and all of that is great but the second

576
00:21:05,280 --> 00:21:07,360
that you finish writing that software

577
00:21:07,360 --> 00:21:09,120
it's technical debt

578
00:21:09,120 --> 00:21:12,240
it's aging on the shelf as it's being

579
00:21:12,240 --> 00:21:15,520
used now in the case of open source

580
00:21:15,520 --> 00:21:17,760
uh i think about it from a drift point

581
00:21:17,760 --> 00:21:19,919
of view that you're drifting from

582
00:21:19,919 --> 00:21:22,400
current so if we go back to that thought

583
00:21:22,400 --> 00:21:24,240
of integrate and abandon

584
00:21:24,240 --> 00:21:26,159
if i integrate version one

585
00:21:26,159 --> 00:21:28,000
and then version 1.1 comes out in

586
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:30,559
version 1.2 we're version 1.5 and then

587
00:21:30,559 --> 00:21:32,400
we're up to version two

588
00:21:32,400 --> 00:21:34,960
i'm drifting farther and farther away in

589
00:21:34,960 --> 00:21:37,679
time in implementation

590
00:21:37,679 --> 00:21:38,880
uh from

591
00:21:38,880 --> 00:21:42,159
the current version of that software

592
00:21:42,159 --> 00:21:43,120
and

593
00:21:43,120 --> 00:21:44,559
if i'm forced

594
00:21:44,559 --> 00:21:46,400
to upgrade

595
00:21:46,400 --> 00:21:48,799
but i don't practice those upgrades this

596
00:21:48,799 --> 00:21:51,039
is no some dissimilar to uh thinking

597
00:21:51,039 --> 00:21:51,919
about

598
00:21:51,919 --> 00:21:53,760
you know i i often hear

599
00:21:53,760 --> 00:21:56,000
that the company say well we need to be

600
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:59,039
able to roll back and if you deliver

601
00:21:59,039 --> 00:22:01,200
software and think about your roll

602
00:22:01,200 --> 00:22:04,159
forward plan my upgrade so i build an

603
00:22:04,159 --> 00:22:06,080
increment and i ship that increment to

604
00:22:06,080 --> 00:22:08,159
production whether that's a single piece

605
00:22:08,159 --> 00:22:10,159
flow or whether that's the end of a

606
00:22:10,159 --> 00:22:12,960
sprint or whether you're doing waterfall

607
00:22:12,960 --> 00:22:14,960
i'm making a change and i'm moving that

608
00:22:14,960 --> 00:22:16,720
change into production if you think

609
00:22:16,720 --> 00:22:18,400
about what it takes

610
00:22:18,400 --> 00:22:20,480
to get to that point all of the testing

611
00:22:20,480 --> 00:22:22,640
that has occurred to get you to the

612
00:22:22,640 --> 00:22:25,039
point where you can do an upgrade

613
00:22:25,039 --> 00:22:27,039
now they say hey we also want to be able

614
00:22:27,039 --> 00:22:28,320
to downgrade

615
00:22:28,320 --> 00:22:29,760
well

616
00:22:29,760 --> 00:22:31,520
shouldn't we test that

617
00:22:31,520 --> 00:22:33,039
i have done

618
00:22:33,039 --> 00:22:36,240
downgrades in a crisis

619
00:22:36,240 --> 00:22:38,880
when i've created an outage

620
00:22:38,880 --> 00:22:40,640
and it's no fun

621
00:22:40,640 --> 00:22:41,760
you're

622
00:22:41,760 --> 00:22:43,679
doing a little bit of guesswork

623
00:22:43,679 --> 00:22:46,000
uh you're working really fast on

624
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:47,840
something that really should have been

625
00:22:47,840 --> 00:22:50,400
practiced so if the intent from a

626
00:22:50,400 --> 00:22:52,400
company perspective is we always want to

627
00:22:52,400 --> 00:22:55,360
have a downgrade path then as a as an

628
00:22:55,360 --> 00:22:57,360
engineering leader i want to make sure

629
00:22:57,360 --> 00:22:59,280
that my teams practice that that becomes

630
00:22:59,280 --> 00:23:01,200
part of the definition of done have you

631
00:23:01,200 --> 00:23:03,520
proven that you can move the software

632
00:23:03,520 --> 00:23:05,440
forward and then move it backwards

633
00:23:05,440 --> 00:23:07,360
successfully because if you don't do

634
00:23:07,360 --> 00:23:10,080
that then all bets are off

635
00:23:10,080 --> 00:23:13,679
same tr is true here as you think about

636
00:23:13,679 --> 00:23:16,320
moving that software up

637
00:23:16,320 --> 00:23:18,640
uh is it a breaking change if i upgrade

638
00:23:18,640 --> 00:23:20,400
a library from one version to another i

639
00:23:20,400 --> 00:23:23,120
mean log4j is a very simple example that

640
00:23:23,120 --> 00:23:25,840
does a very simple thing but there are

641
00:23:25,840 --> 00:23:27,600
more complex examples in open source

642
00:23:27,600 --> 00:23:29,440
where if i move it i have to make a

643
00:23:29,440 --> 00:23:31,120
bunch of changes to the software and if

644
00:23:31,120 --> 00:23:32,880
i need to move it back because it broke

645
00:23:32,880 --> 00:23:34,640
something i'm going to have to undo all

646
00:23:34,640 --> 00:23:36,400
those changes so do you have the right

647
00:23:36,400 --> 00:23:38,080
level of testing

648
00:23:38,080 --> 00:23:39,600
that says

649
00:23:39,600 --> 00:23:41,360
if i change this library everything

650
00:23:41,360 --> 00:23:42,559
works

651
00:23:42,559 --> 00:23:44,400
or not because if you don't then we

652
00:23:44,400 --> 00:23:46,240
should have a look at that but think

653
00:23:46,240 --> 00:23:47,760
about making sure that you build the

654
00:23:47,760 --> 00:23:49,520
muscle that says i'm going to keep

655
00:23:49,520 --> 00:23:51,679
current to some degree of current or i'm

656
00:23:51,679 --> 00:23:52,799
at least going to measure it and

657
00:23:52,799 --> 00:23:54,480
understand it

658
00:23:54,480 --> 00:23:56,480
a couple of minor versions never a major

659
00:23:56,480 --> 00:23:57,919
version those kind of things so those

660
00:23:57,919 --> 00:23:58,960
are the things that i want you to think

661
00:23:58,960 --> 00:24:00,240
about

662
00:24:00,240 --> 00:24:01,840
and now we get in that now we get into

663
00:24:01,840 --> 00:24:03,520
that hygiene

664
00:24:03,520 --> 00:24:05,120
you could buy a car

665
00:24:05,120 --> 00:24:07,440
uh and the manufacturer will recommend

666
00:24:07,440 --> 00:24:09,679
for every three thousand five thousand

667
00:24:09,679 --> 00:24:11,279
ten thousand miles depending on the kind

668
00:24:11,279 --> 00:24:13,279
of oil the kind of car

669
00:24:13,279 --> 00:24:15,200
you should

670
00:24:15,200 --> 00:24:16,880
keyword is should

671
00:24:16,880 --> 00:24:18,640
perform that regular maintenance now the

672
00:24:18,640 --> 00:24:19,760
the great thing about regular

673
00:24:19,760 --> 00:24:20,880
maintenance

674
00:24:20,880 --> 00:24:23,279
in this sense is that it can be done at

675
00:24:23,279 --> 00:24:25,600
a time that's convenient to you you get

676
00:24:25,600 --> 00:24:27,679
to pick when this maintenance happens

677
00:24:27,679 --> 00:24:30,400
because we're not in crisis mode

678
00:24:30,400 --> 00:24:32,480
it is inexpensive

679
00:24:32,480 --> 00:24:34,320
um we could talk in terms of software

680
00:24:34,320 --> 00:24:36,320
but in terms of cash and money for for

681
00:24:36,320 --> 00:24:39,039
an oil change 50 bucks

682
00:24:39,039 --> 00:24:41,200
uh and it takes a very short amount of

683
00:24:41,200 --> 00:24:42,240
time

684
00:24:42,240 --> 00:24:45,039
15 20 minutes oil change done i move on

685
00:24:45,039 --> 00:24:48,159
with my day it allows the car to operate

686
00:24:48,159 --> 00:24:50,559
better for longer now if i choose not to

687
00:24:50,559 --> 00:24:51,840
do that

688
00:24:51,840 --> 00:24:53,840
as in the case of software then what's

689
00:24:53,840 --> 00:24:55,600
going to happen is all of a sudden that

690
00:24:55,600 --> 00:24:57,520
car is going to stop working

691
00:24:57,520 --> 00:24:59,360
and i don't get to pick when that

692
00:24:59,360 --> 00:25:00,880
happens

693
00:25:00,880 --> 00:25:02,960
so it could be at the most inopportune

694
00:25:02,960 --> 00:25:05,360
time in my life

695
00:25:05,360 --> 00:25:07,760
it is now going to be very expensive

696
00:25:07,760 --> 00:25:10,320
it's no longer cheap

697
00:25:10,320 --> 00:25:11,360
and the amount of time it's going to

698
00:25:11,360 --> 00:25:12,960
take to perform that maintenance to get

699
00:25:12,960 --> 00:25:14,640
that car running again is going to be

700
00:25:14,640 --> 00:25:16,480
measured on a calendar

701
00:25:16,480 --> 00:25:18,960
so incredibly inconvenient

702
00:25:18,960 --> 00:25:20,720
this is what we do in our software

703
00:25:20,720 --> 00:25:22,400
practice sometimes when we don't think

704
00:25:22,400 --> 00:25:23,919
about technical debt we don't think

705
00:25:23,919 --> 00:25:25,520
about upgrades we don't think about

706
00:25:25,520 --> 00:25:27,679
moving our architecture our designs our

707
00:25:27,679 --> 00:25:30,640
deployment patterns along with the times

708
00:25:30,640 --> 00:25:32,320
such that what would have been

709
00:25:32,320 --> 00:25:34,080
inexpensive to move between minor

710
00:25:34,080 --> 00:25:36,080
versions of an open source library now

711
00:25:36,080 --> 00:25:39,279
becomes a major uplift to make a bunch

712
00:25:39,279 --> 00:25:41,440
of change that could cost

713
00:25:41,440 --> 00:25:44,640
months of time

714
00:25:45,760 --> 00:25:47,600
you should look at how long it's going

715
00:25:47,600 --> 00:25:49,200
to take you from the time that someone

716
00:25:49,200 --> 00:25:52,240
says i need to make a change to the time

717
00:25:52,240 --> 00:25:54,640
you're able to implement that change

718
00:25:54,640 --> 00:25:56,880
across whatever it is so again you're

719
00:25:56,880 --> 00:25:58,720
accruing technical debt in a number of

720
00:25:58,720 --> 00:26:01,600
areas you're accruing it architecturally

721
00:26:01,600 --> 00:26:03,760
you're accruing it in the open source

722
00:26:03,760 --> 00:26:06,159
that you're utilizing um

723
00:26:06,159 --> 00:26:08,480
your process as a whole are you doing

724
00:26:08,480 --> 00:26:10,080
waterfall are you doing agile or you're

725
00:26:10,080 --> 00:26:12,320
doing devops

726
00:26:12,320 --> 00:26:14,240
what time how much time would it take

727
00:26:14,240 --> 00:26:16,559
you if someone dropped into your sprint

728
00:26:16,559 --> 00:26:18,000
and said hey

729
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:19,200
critical

730
00:26:19,200 --> 00:26:21,279
downtime whatever

731
00:26:21,279 --> 00:26:23,120
how long would it take you to to

732
00:26:23,120 --> 00:26:25,039
implement that change and get it to

733
00:26:25,039 --> 00:26:27,520
production and feel safe about it i mean

734
00:26:27,520 --> 00:26:28,880
anyone can make a software change and

735
00:26:28,880 --> 00:26:30,320
push it and hope

736
00:26:30,320 --> 00:26:32,000
but that's not the way we run a good

737
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:33,520
business and a good engineering practice

738
00:26:33,520 --> 00:26:35,039
so what would it take to move from there

739
00:26:35,039 --> 00:26:36,720
to there

740
00:26:36,720 --> 00:26:37,679
so

741
00:26:37,679 --> 00:26:40,080
it's about building the right muscles

742
00:26:40,080 --> 00:26:42,240
again if it looks like the game if you

743
00:26:42,240 --> 00:26:44,799
pl practice like you play

744
00:26:44,799 --> 00:26:46,640
if your lower environments and your

745
00:26:46,640 --> 00:26:48,080
testing

746
00:26:48,080 --> 00:26:50,080
are all happening in an automated

747
00:26:50,080 --> 00:26:51,919
fashion and they look the same whether

748
00:26:51,919 --> 00:26:54,559
you're doing a development test or

749
00:26:54,559 --> 00:26:56,640
you're doing a quality test or you're in

750
00:26:56,640 --> 00:26:58,720
your staging environment to production

751
00:26:58,720 --> 00:27:00,640
if all of those things are scripted and

752
00:27:00,640 --> 00:27:01,840
run

753
00:27:01,840 --> 00:27:04,080
headless and run the exact same way such

754
00:27:04,080 --> 00:27:06,240
that if you find a mistake you can move

755
00:27:06,240 --> 00:27:07,919
that mistake backwards in your testing

756
00:27:07,919 --> 00:27:09,120
lab

757
00:27:09,120 --> 00:27:10,720
those are the muscles that you want to

758
00:27:10,720 --> 00:27:12,159
build

759
00:27:12,159 --> 00:27:14,080
being able to upgrade those libraries

760
00:27:14,080 --> 00:27:16,159
because i have quality tests around them

761
00:27:16,159 --> 00:27:19,039
that say i understand the usage of this

762
00:27:19,039 --> 00:27:21,200
library and if i make a change i can now

763
00:27:21,200 --> 00:27:22,880
quickly test and ascertain whether or

764
00:27:22,880 --> 00:27:25,760
not that change is going to break my

765
00:27:25,760 --> 00:27:27,440
implementation

766
00:27:27,440 --> 00:27:29,919
those are muscles you want to have

767
00:27:29,919 --> 00:27:32,640
and be able to now quickly cycle through

768
00:27:32,640 --> 00:27:33,600
and say

769
00:27:33,600 --> 00:27:35,520
on a quarterly basis so similar to what

770
00:27:35,520 --> 00:27:37,279
we do in it

771
00:27:37,279 --> 00:27:39,039
am i doing patches am i doing those

772
00:27:39,039 --> 00:27:40,960
upgrades am i saying well i don't want

773
00:27:40,960 --> 00:27:42,720
to do it all the time continuously

774
00:27:42,720 --> 00:27:44,640
that's not that that's not really

775
00:27:44,640 --> 00:27:46,399
relevant to me maybe i'll do a monthly

776
00:27:46,399 --> 00:27:48,559
maybe i'll do it quarterly but it's

777
00:27:48,559 --> 00:27:50,640
planful i understand the debt that i'm

778
00:27:50,640 --> 00:27:53,440
accruing and i'm now going to take uh

779
00:27:53,440 --> 00:27:55,679
take that and pay down that debt over

780
00:27:55,679 --> 00:27:58,159
time every quarter

781
00:27:58,159 --> 00:28:00,320
which means that you know i i now have

782
00:28:00,320 --> 00:28:02,240
i'm building that muscle around those

783
00:28:02,240 --> 00:28:04,799
upgrades

784
00:28:04,799 --> 00:28:07,039
think about the objectives that you want

785
00:28:07,039 --> 00:28:08,559
think about

786
00:28:08,559 --> 00:28:09,520
where

787
00:28:09,520 --> 00:28:12,000
uh where what kpis do you have that

788
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:14,000
unders that understand this are you

789
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:15,679
measuring the amount of technical debt

790
00:28:15,679 --> 00:28:17,840
that you're accruing do you have that

791
00:28:17,840 --> 00:28:19,760
ledger that says

792
00:28:19,760 --> 00:28:21,679
here are the things that are now out of

793
00:28:21,679 --> 00:28:24,000
date here are the things that need to be

794
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:27,440
put somewhere in a sprint at some point

795
00:28:27,440 --> 00:28:29,360
now it's okay

796
00:28:29,360 --> 00:28:31,520
to decide that you are going to accrue

797
00:28:31,520 --> 00:28:32,640
this debt

798
00:28:32,640 --> 00:28:34,880
i you know i often think about when i

799
00:28:34,880 --> 00:28:37,039
bought my first home

800
00:28:37,039 --> 00:28:39,039
you move in i don't have a lot of money

801
00:28:39,039 --> 00:28:40,640
i spent most of it on buying the house

802
00:28:40,640 --> 00:28:42,799
in the first place i now am faced with a

803
00:28:42,799 --> 00:28:45,120
house full of empty furniture

804
00:28:45,120 --> 00:28:46,799
well i'm going to go out and get some

805
00:28:46,799 --> 00:28:48,480
credit and i'm going to start to fill

806
00:28:48,480 --> 00:28:51,039
the rooms i don't fill them all at once

807
00:28:51,039 --> 00:28:53,039
you know i prioritize things i say this

808
00:28:53,039 --> 00:28:55,039
is important today i want to have a nice

809
00:28:55,039 --> 00:28:56,640
kitchen set i want to have a nice place

810
00:28:56,640 --> 00:29:00,320
to entertain uh maybe i'm sleeping on

811
00:29:00,320 --> 00:29:02,480
the mattress on the floor for now i

812
00:29:02,480 --> 00:29:04,880
don't care so these are ways that you

813
00:29:04,880 --> 00:29:06,880
know in your life you think about

814
00:29:06,880 --> 00:29:08,640
managing debt

815
00:29:08,640 --> 00:29:10,880
apply that to your software practice be

816
00:29:10,880 --> 00:29:12,720
mindful of what you do

817
00:29:12,720 --> 00:29:15,520
and and be able to pay that down or at

818
00:29:15,520 --> 00:29:16,720
least understand how much that's going

819
00:29:16,720 --> 00:29:18,720
to cost if you have to pay it down so as

820
00:29:18,720 --> 00:29:21,039
you look at that continuum from

821
00:29:21,039 --> 00:29:23,760
where you are today by looking in the

822
00:29:23,760 --> 00:29:26,720
mirror to where you want to be

823
00:29:26,720 --> 00:29:29,360
in that ideal scenario of

824
00:29:29,360 --> 00:29:31,840
upgrades just happen magically i take

825
00:29:31,840 --> 00:29:33,679
the latest version of open source and i

826
00:29:33,679 --> 00:29:36,000
just roll it in i run my tests and i

827
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:38,240
deploy it into production continuously

828
00:29:38,240 --> 00:29:39,760
well that's great

829
00:29:39,760 --> 00:29:42,559
if you're not there then understand

830
00:29:42,559 --> 00:29:44,640
what it's going to take between those

831
00:29:44,640 --> 00:29:46,080
two and then pick that point where

832
00:29:46,080 --> 00:29:47,679
you're actually going to land

833
00:29:47,679 --> 00:29:49,360
how much money are you willing to spend

834
00:29:49,360 --> 00:29:50,960
how much effort are you willing to put

835
00:29:50,960 --> 00:29:53,039
in how much change are you willing to

836
00:29:53,039 --> 00:29:55,600
make in the way that you build and

837
00:29:55,600 --> 00:29:58,640
deploy your software to get you to that

838
00:29:58,640 --> 00:30:00,880
point and then do it

839
00:30:00,880 --> 00:30:03,279
so really this talk has been around

840
00:30:03,279 --> 00:30:05,360
building out the right habits

841
00:30:05,360 --> 00:30:07,360
and building the right muscles that can

842
00:30:07,360 --> 00:30:09,840
help you in those crisis situations the

843
00:30:09,840 --> 00:30:11,440
the worst thing you can do is walk away

844
00:30:11,440 --> 00:30:13,600
from a crisis and run back to work

845
00:30:13,600 --> 00:30:15,360
the best thing you can do is to lean

846
00:30:15,360 --> 00:30:17,360
into that to say what could we have

847
00:30:17,360 --> 00:30:18,720
learned from this how could this have

848
00:30:18,720 --> 00:30:20,080
been better

849
00:30:20,080 --> 00:30:21,440
and that's really what i want you to

850
00:30:21,440 --> 00:30:22,880
take away from this

851
00:30:22,880 --> 00:30:25,600
so i appreciate your time and i'm happy

852
00:30:25,600 --> 00:30:29,840
to take any questions if there are any

853
00:30:34,159 --> 00:30:36,880
hey pete thanks for that and um

854
00:30:36,880 --> 00:30:38,240
thanks for getting up so early as well i

855
00:30:38,240 --> 00:30:39,440
think it's not even breakfast time there

856
00:30:39,440 --> 00:30:41,600
yet it's an excellent job

857
00:30:41,600 --> 00:30:44,559
but i have coffee that's that's the

858
00:30:44,559 --> 00:30:46,880
power through um so there are there are

859
00:30:46,880 --> 00:30:49,039
a couple of questions um so i'll put

860
00:30:49,039 --> 00:30:50,880
these on screen as well

861
00:30:50,880 --> 00:30:53,440
so uh ecrum asked how much of technical

862
00:30:53,440 --> 00:30:54,720
debt and the current state of

863
00:30:54,720 --> 00:30:56,880
application securities down to develop a

864
00:30:56,880 --> 00:30:58,880
talent debt i.e people who have fixed in

865
00:30:58,880 --> 00:30:59,919
their ways

866
00:30:59,919 --> 00:31:01,760
won't update their skills

867
00:31:01,760 --> 00:31:04,399
um and secondly how can non-decision

868
00:31:04,399 --> 00:31:06,960
makers i guess like ingram uh influence

869
00:31:06,960 --> 00:31:08,640
that situation as well

870
00:31:08,640 --> 00:31:10,480
uh that's an awesome question and

871
00:31:10,480 --> 00:31:12,880
certainly you know as we look at how

872
00:31:12,880 --> 00:31:15,039
development and the definite the very

873
00:31:15,039 --> 00:31:16,880
definition of an application has changed

874
00:31:16,880 --> 00:31:19,519
over time it used to be about my first

875
00:31:19,519 --> 00:31:21,679
party code and second party code now we

876
00:31:21,679 --> 00:31:22,960
introduce open source we have to

877
00:31:22,960 --> 00:31:24,799
introduce infrastructure as code you

878
00:31:24,799 --> 00:31:27,760
know where i'm now picking the container

879
00:31:27,760 --> 00:31:29,120
and the operating system that i'm

880
00:31:29,120 --> 00:31:31,120
running on i need to harden that these

881
00:31:31,120 --> 00:31:32,960
are things that developers never never

882
00:31:32,960 --> 00:31:35,519
had to think about so it's definitely a

883
00:31:35,519 --> 00:31:36,960
talent that

884
00:31:36,960 --> 00:31:39,120
measuring the places that you fail

885
00:31:39,120 --> 00:31:40,399
understanding

886
00:31:40,399 --> 00:31:42,240
where you want to be and what it's going

887
00:31:42,240 --> 00:31:43,360
to take to get there understanding

888
00:31:43,360 --> 00:31:45,039
you're not going to get there overnight

889
00:31:45,039 --> 00:31:47,279
but this is about being

890
00:31:47,279 --> 00:31:50,000
mindful of where you are and mindful of

891
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:52,240
the goals and then putting the effort

892
00:31:52,240 --> 00:31:54,480
into the right place so this needs to be

893
00:31:54,480 --> 00:31:56,240
a business decision

894
00:31:56,240 --> 00:31:57,760
because to

895
00:31:57,760 --> 00:32:00,399
uh you know it's it's classic that what

896
00:32:00,399 --> 00:32:02,399
you want for your development teams and

897
00:32:02,399 --> 00:32:04,480
as a development leader i strode to do

898
00:32:04,480 --> 00:32:07,039
this but it's super hard you want a day

899
00:32:07,039 --> 00:32:09,600
where people can unwind and think

900
00:32:09,600 --> 00:32:12,559
um but having a five-day sprint be

901
00:32:12,559 --> 00:32:15,200
actually four days of work and one day

902
00:32:15,200 --> 00:32:16,799
of mental work

903
00:32:16,799 --> 00:32:19,120
who buys that uh the business looks at

904
00:32:19,120 --> 00:32:20,399
that and say why are your developers

905
00:32:20,399 --> 00:32:21,679
sitting around why aren't they doing

906
00:32:21,679 --> 00:32:24,159
things i'm like they actually are

907
00:32:24,159 --> 00:32:25,840
and you know you have all this evidence

908
00:32:25,840 --> 00:32:27,279
that proves that

909
00:32:27,279 --> 00:32:28,880
that they they're actually better doing

910
00:32:28,880 --> 00:32:29,919
that but that's not the way you

911
00:32:29,919 --> 00:32:32,480
typically run so it's about having that

912
00:32:32,480 --> 00:32:34,080
ledger and saying look we're building

913
00:32:34,080 --> 00:32:35,519
this stuff up and this is going to be

914
00:32:35,519 --> 00:32:38,399
bad i look at that log for j example to

915
00:32:38,399 --> 00:32:40,640
say that's a perfect example about why

916
00:32:40,640 --> 00:32:42,720
we should be building these muscles so

917
00:32:42,720 --> 00:32:44,640
you know it writing it down making it

918
00:32:44,640 --> 00:32:46,559
visible and talking to your business

919
00:32:46,559 --> 00:32:49,039
leaders about it

920
00:32:49,039 --> 00:32:51,600
i i particularly enjoyed many of your

921
00:32:51,600 --> 00:32:53,919
extremely vivid metaphors in that talk

922
00:32:53,919 --> 00:32:56,000
that i may well have to steal for future

923
00:32:56,000 --> 00:32:58,559
uh talks of my own but the uh free

924
00:32:58,559 --> 00:33:02,320
puppies not free lunch and uh and uh age

925
00:33:02,320 --> 00:33:06,480
open source ages like milk not wine

926
00:33:06,480 --> 00:33:07,600
favorites

927
00:33:07,600 --> 00:33:08,880
and of course this plot's called

928
00:33:08,880 --> 00:33:10,960
football but i'll give you that

929
00:33:10,960 --> 00:33:13,760
all right yes i i i am i i am in love

930
00:33:13,760 --> 00:33:16,080
with that sport it is the beautiful game

931
00:33:16,080 --> 00:33:18,000
so yes i mean i think it's it says

932
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:20,000
something about you know the state of

933
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:22,080
sport in the in the us when people start

934
00:33:22,080 --> 00:33:23,279
actually

935
00:33:23,279 --> 00:33:25,440
talking about soccer in uh in conference

936
00:33:25,440 --> 00:33:27,600
presentations

937
00:33:27,600 --> 00:33:28,640
you know

938
00:33:28,640 --> 00:33:30,000
i'm sure that probably wouldn't happen

939
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:32,320
15 years ago it is an emea talk so you

940
00:33:32,320 --> 00:33:35,678
know that is that is topical

941
00:33:35,840 --> 00:33:37,519
so jamie have we got any more any more

942
00:33:37,519 --> 00:33:38,880
questions for pete

943
00:33:38,880 --> 00:33:41,600
uh yeah um so one from me actually so um

944
00:33:41,600 --> 00:33:43,120
you said early on that feedback is a

945
00:33:43,120 --> 00:33:45,919
gift um so what effective ways are there

946
00:33:45,919 --> 00:33:48,159
to prepare someone to receive that

947
00:33:48,159 --> 00:33:50,159
feedback because it's i guess if you

948
00:33:50,159 --> 00:33:52,000
just weighed in with it they may want to

949
00:33:52,000 --> 00:33:54,080
hear from you right right oh absolutely

950
00:33:54,080 --> 00:33:57,120
yeah and that is uh a critical aspect

951
00:33:57,120 --> 00:33:59,120
thank you for the question

952
00:33:59,120 --> 00:34:00,640
you have to ask

953
00:34:00,640 --> 00:34:02,480
you have to uh

954
00:34:02,480 --> 00:34:04,000
read the room

955
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:05,840
so you know if you're with a buddy who's

956
00:34:05,840 --> 00:34:07,600
doing a presentation and it goes

957
00:34:07,600 --> 00:34:09,280
horribly wrong and you can see that

958
00:34:09,280 --> 00:34:11,440
they're seething that is not the time

959
00:34:11,440 --> 00:34:13,599
for them to be mentally capable and and

960
00:34:13,599 --> 00:34:16,320
ready to take in this feedback of like

961
00:34:16,320 --> 00:34:18,800
oh great it was worse than i thought uh

962
00:34:18,800 --> 00:34:21,119
so you need to be mindful of the fact

963
00:34:21,119 --> 00:34:23,679
that it's not always the right time you

964
00:34:23,679 --> 00:34:26,320
need to ask to be invited

965
00:34:26,320 --> 00:34:28,480
the key here is if i ask you and you

966
00:34:28,480 --> 00:34:30,480
invite me and say yes i would i welcome

967
00:34:30,480 --> 00:34:32,639
the feedback then it's really on them to

968
00:34:32,639 --> 00:34:35,040
to take that feedback as is

969
00:34:35,040 --> 00:34:37,199
uh be constructive

970
00:34:37,199 --> 00:34:38,719
um and but understand that even

971
00:34:38,719 --> 00:34:41,520
sometimes when they get that feedback it

972
00:34:41,520 --> 00:34:43,119
might rub them the wrong way and i've

973
00:34:43,119 --> 00:34:45,839
had that happen to me where i have asked

974
00:34:45,839 --> 00:34:47,918
to give feedback they've said yes i want

975
00:34:47,918 --> 00:34:49,440
it but what they were expecting was the

976
00:34:49,440 --> 00:34:50,879
pat on the back

977
00:34:50,879 --> 00:34:52,800
that's not what i was delivering at that

978
00:34:52,800 --> 00:34:53,679
time

979
00:34:53,679 --> 00:34:55,280
so you know this is one of those things

980
00:34:55,280 --> 00:34:57,119
where they need to learn that look say

981
00:34:57,119 --> 00:34:59,359
no i'm okay with no and you have to be

982
00:34:59,359 --> 00:35:01,520
okay with no to either cycle back or

983
00:35:01,520 --> 00:35:03,760
maybe never cycle back some people don't

984
00:35:03,760 --> 00:35:05,440
want it some people don't want to hear

985
00:35:05,440 --> 00:35:07,280
it but yes it's a great question you

986
00:35:07,280 --> 00:35:09,680
should always ask

987
00:35:09,680 --> 00:35:11,839
absolutely um and i think timing's

988
00:35:11,839 --> 00:35:13,119
important with that as well as listening

989
00:35:13,119 --> 00:35:15,839
to um uh podcast the you are not so

990
00:35:15,839 --> 00:35:17,680
smart um podcast it's well worth

991
00:35:17,680 --> 00:35:19,920
checking out but psychology and then

992
00:35:19,920 --> 00:35:21,599
things like that and they were saying

993
00:35:21,599 --> 00:35:23,440
the example they used with feedback was

994
00:35:23,440 --> 00:35:24,960
um it's about timing as well so the

995
00:35:24,960 --> 00:35:26,960
example he gave the guest on there said

996
00:35:26,960 --> 00:35:27,920
um

997
00:35:27,920 --> 00:35:29,920
that he'd been to see a friend who acts

998
00:35:29,920 --> 00:35:31,440
and the play wasn't particularly good

999
00:35:31,440 --> 00:35:32,800
and the friend comes rushing up to him

1000
00:35:32,800 --> 00:35:34,320
after the show and says how was it how

1001
00:35:34,320 --> 00:35:35,520
was it

1002
00:35:35,520 --> 00:35:37,440
he said so he said he wasn't gonna lie

1003
00:35:37,440 --> 00:35:38,800
but he wasn't gonna give him the brutal

1004
00:35:38,800 --> 00:35:41,359
truth either

1005
00:35:42,720 --> 00:35:45,520
we lost jamie there

1006
00:35:45,520 --> 00:35:47,359
well at least he ended up smiling i said

1007
00:35:47,359 --> 00:35:49,280
that i enjoyed being

1008
00:35:49,280 --> 00:35:50,400
yeah

1009
00:35:50,400 --> 00:35:51,920
i'm am i back

1010
00:35:51,920 --> 00:35:54,160
yeah you're right yeah you're back yeah

1011
00:35:54,160 --> 00:35:56,240
yeah so so um yeah so so he didn't lie

1012
00:35:56,240 --> 00:35:57,760
to her but then a few days passed

1013
00:35:57,760 --> 00:35:58,880
nellie's and then he was able to bring

1014
00:35:58,880 --> 00:36:01,040
up the topic and ask and and to approach

1015
00:36:01,040 --> 00:36:02,400
it that way so you need to be in that

1016
00:36:02,400 --> 00:36:03,680
mental space

1017
00:36:03,680 --> 00:36:05,359
where you're prepared for whatever is

1018
00:36:05,359 --> 00:36:09,680
going to come and understand that again

1019
00:36:09,680 --> 00:36:11,520
it's not malicious you have to presume

1020
00:36:11,520 --> 00:36:14,160
positive intent the reason i mean as a

1021
00:36:14,160 --> 00:36:16,720
leader the reason that i come to you to

1022
00:36:16,720 --> 00:36:19,119
say we can be better is not because i

1023
00:36:19,119 --> 00:36:20,560
want to beat you up and make you feel

1024
00:36:20,560 --> 00:36:22,800
bad i'm trying to motivate you to say

1025
00:36:22,800 --> 00:36:23,760
look

1026
00:36:23,760 --> 00:36:26,480
that was good if we make this change

1027
00:36:26,480 --> 00:36:27,680
then things are going to be that much

1028
00:36:27,680 --> 00:36:29,200
better and let's let's try that and

1029
00:36:29,200 --> 00:36:31,440
experiment i mean this is what devops is

1030
00:36:31,440 --> 00:36:32,640
all about

1031
00:36:32,640 --> 00:36:34,320
there's uh for folks who are interested

1032
00:36:34,320 --> 00:36:36,320
in that kind of space this um

1033
00:36:36,320 --> 00:36:39,119
uh if you read reid hastings book about

1034
00:36:39,119 --> 00:36:41,119
netflix there's a lot of very very

1035
00:36:41,119 --> 00:36:43,760
interesting uh stuff in there about the

1036
00:36:43,760 --> 00:36:46,079
culture of candid feedback that kind of

1037
00:36:46,079 --> 00:36:49,119
drives high performance at netflix um so

1038
00:36:49,119 --> 00:36:51,119
that's but it has to be culture that i

1039
00:36:51,119 --> 00:36:52,800
mean that's a cultural change everyone's

1040
00:36:52,800 --> 00:36:54,640
like hey it's uh

1041
00:36:54,640 --> 00:36:56,560
it's coming you know

1042
00:36:56,560 --> 00:36:58,960
that's that's absolutely a core part of

1043
00:36:58,960 --> 00:37:01,599
uh and and both ways i mean i would

1044
00:37:01,599 --> 00:37:03,200
would also add to that to that

1045
00:37:03,200 --> 00:37:05,760
discussion that you know if you present

1046
00:37:05,760 --> 00:37:07,839
as a leader as someone who welcomes

1047
00:37:07,839 --> 00:37:09,440
feedback yourself

1048
00:37:09,440 --> 00:37:12,400
then that that that promotes a space in

1049
00:37:12,400 --> 00:37:15,040
which people feel that feedback is safe

1050
00:37:15,040 --> 00:37:17,119
and it's about being vulnerable so as

1051
00:37:17,119 --> 00:37:18,800
when i ran teams

1052
00:37:18,800 --> 00:37:21,119
i you know i was i was forthright to say

1053
00:37:21,119 --> 00:37:23,119
look i know that wasn't great i need i

1054
00:37:23,119 --> 00:37:24,320
need your help

1055
00:37:24,320 --> 00:37:26,880
when you ask for help so that's another

1056
00:37:26,880 --> 00:37:29,599
key is if you are the one asking for

1057
00:37:29,599 --> 00:37:31,119
that feedback and saying look i

1058
00:37:31,119 --> 00:37:32,800
understand that wasn't great how could

1059
00:37:32,800 --> 00:37:34,160
how could i have done it differently how

1060
00:37:34,160 --> 00:37:35,839
could i have done it better

1061
00:37:35,839 --> 00:37:37,680
and be vulnerable to the fact that

1062
00:37:37,680 --> 00:37:40,160
you're not perfect uh you didn't do it

1063
00:37:40,160 --> 00:37:42,240
the right way and that you're you're

1064
00:37:42,240 --> 00:37:43,599
ready to learn

1065
00:37:43,599 --> 00:37:46,560
people see that and respond to it

1066
00:37:46,560 --> 00:37:47,839
well i think we can talk about that

1067
00:37:47,839 --> 00:37:49,440
topic all day it's certainly something

1068
00:37:49,440 --> 00:37:51,599

1069
