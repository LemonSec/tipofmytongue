00:00:00,470 --> 00:00:04,319
[Music]

2
00:00:04,799 --> 00:00:07,600
um we've got uh josh grossman joining us

3
00:00:07,600 --> 00:00:08,800
hi josh

4
00:00:08,800 --> 00:00:11,360
hi there how's it going you're gonna uh

5
00:00:11,360 --> 00:00:13,440
see us out of this evening this

6
00:00:13,440 --> 00:00:15,200
afternoon's uh

7
00:00:15,200 --> 00:00:17,600
good afternoon's entertainment

8
00:00:17,600 --> 00:00:21,600
um so josh is the cto of bounce security

9
00:00:21,600 --> 00:00:23,439
and um

10
00:00:23,439 --> 00:00:26,240
today's talk is going to be about tuning

11
00:00:26,240 --> 00:00:28,720
your security toolbox right josh

12
00:00:28,720 --> 00:00:30,960
yep that's exactly exactly yeah would

13
00:00:30,960 --> 00:00:33,200
you like to share your uh share your

14
00:00:33,200 --> 00:00:35,760
screen and i'll get you uh

15
00:00:35,760 --> 00:00:37,760
yeah one second

16
00:00:37,760 --> 00:00:39,840
um okay that's in the right place i just

17
00:00:39,840 --> 00:00:42,800
need to come down here

18
00:00:42,800 --> 00:00:45,800
and

19
00:00:49,280 --> 00:00:52,480
there you go okay can you see that now

20
00:00:52,480 --> 00:00:54,480
i can we'll add those in

21
00:00:54,480 --> 00:00:56,640
so the floor is yours

22
00:00:56,640 --> 00:00:58,719
excellent thank you thank you very much

23
00:00:58,719 --> 00:01:00,399
um thanks very much for putting on this

24
00:01:00,399 --> 00:01:03,039
uh great conference and uh some really

25
00:01:03,039 --> 00:01:04,479
uh interesting talks on the on the

26
00:01:04,479 --> 00:01:08,000
lineup so uh yeah certainly a good day

27
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:08,880
um

28
00:01:08,880 --> 00:01:10,479
so yeah i've come to uh today to talk

29
00:01:10,479 --> 00:01:13,119
about uh tune your toolbox for velocity

30
00:01:13,119 --> 00:01:15,600
and value um the idea being how can you

31
00:01:15,600 --> 00:01:17,840
get better value out of application

32
00:01:17,840 --> 00:01:19,439
security scanning tools

33
00:01:19,439 --> 00:01:21,200
uh i've got quite a lot to go through so

34
00:01:21,200 --> 00:01:22,720
i'll just quickly uh

35
00:01:22,720 --> 00:01:24,560
try and whisper a couple of uh words

36
00:01:24,560 --> 00:01:27,360
about me uh i can compliment my clicker

37
00:01:27,360 --> 00:01:28,240
to work

38
00:01:28,240 --> 00:01:30,960
so as you said i am the cto of bounce

39
00:01:30,960 --> 00:01:33,280
security uh we specialize in providing

40
00:01:33,280 --> 00:01:35,439
application security consulting for

41
00:01:35,439 --> 00:01:37,520
various clients both locally and abroad

42
00:01:37,520 --> 00:01:39,439
i also do various different speaking

43
00:01:39,439 --> 00:01:41,119
engagements i also do training on

44
00:01:41,119 --> 00:01:43,920
application security um

45
00:01:43,920 --> 00:01:46,079
both about uh

46
00:01:46,079 --> 00:01:48,240
the asps which is a

47
00:01:48,240 --> 00:01:49,680
i guess a pet project of mine something

48
00:01:49,680 --> 00:01:52,880
i'm involved with at oasp and also about

49
00:01:52,880 --> 00:01:54,720
application security tools as well um

50
00:01:54,720 --> 00:01:56,000
sort of a

51
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:58,799
larger version of this talk so um

52
00:01:58,799 --> 00:02:00,079
certainly that's something that's

53
00:02:00,079 --> 00:02:01,600
interesting to you please feel free free

54
00:02:01,600 --> 00:02:03,759
to get in touch with me um

55
00:02:03,759 --> 00:02:05,200
yeah in my spare time i put a few

56
00:02:05,200 --> 00:02:07,680
pictures up of uh what i get up to but

57
00:02:07,680 --> 00:02:09,598
uh for the most part it's uh application

58
00:02:09,598 --> 00:02:12,160
scooter is balanced and with oh us and

59
00:02:12,160 --> 00:02:14,160
uh some hiking and family time when i'm

60
00:02:14,160 --> 00:02:15,680
not working

61
00:02:15,680 --> 00:02:17,599
so

62
00:02:17,599 --> 00:02:19,760
why why are we here why do i want to

63
00:02:19,760 --> 00:02:21,120
why do you want to talk about us today

64
00:02:21,120 --> 00:02:23,360
so with application screen scanning

65
00:02:23,360 --> 00:02:24,800
tools people see a lot of challenges a

66
00:02:24,800 --> 00:02:27,280
lot of issues um it's often difficult to

67
00:02:27,280 --> 00:02:28,800
understand what exactly the tools we're

68
00:02:28,800 --> 00:02:29,920
trying to achieve

69
00:02:29,920 --> 00:02:32,959
it can take quite a long time to really

70
00:02:32,959 --> 00:02:34,640
get to grips with these processes and to

71
00:02:34,640 --> 00:02:35,599
figure out okay how am i going to get

72
00:02:35,599 --> 00:02:37,280
value from these tools how you know what

73
00:02:37,280 --> 00:02:38,879
am i seeing here

74
00:02:38,879 --> 00:02:41,120
um they can often provide lots and lots

75
00:02:41,120 --> 00:02:42,560
and lots and lots of findings we have to

76
00:02:42,560 --> 00:02:44,720
go through and try and triage and say

77
00:02:44,720 --> 00:02:46,480
okay is this important is that important

78
00:02:46,480 --> 00:02:47,360
how am i going to go through these

79
00:02:47,360 --> 00:02:49,519
hundreds and thousands of records

80
00:02:49,519 --> 00:02:50,480
um

81
00:02:50,480 --> 00:02:51,599
and often

82
00:02:51,599 --> 00:02:53,680
documentation can be a little bit sparse

83
00:02:53,680 --> 00:02:55,599
certainly for you know how do i deal

84
00:02:55,599 --> 00:02:57,440
with this or okay i've now got

85
00:02:57,440 --> 00:02:59,280
everything running there's a

86
00:02:59,280 --> 00:03:01,599
very complex ci cd that puts everything

87
00:03:01,599 --> 00:03:03,040
in the pipeline and runs all the scans

88
00:03:03,040 --> 00:03:04,959
but now what you know how do i how do i

89
00:03:04,959 --> 00:03:06,319
deal with the output

90
00:03:06,319 --> 00:03:08,640
and the aim today is to try and i get to

91
00:03:08,640 --> 00:03:09,920
talk through some ideas to help with

92
00:03:09,920 --> 00:03:11,280
that

93
00:03:11,280 --> 00:03:13,840
um quick disclaimer uh your mileage may

94
00:03:13,840 --> 00:03:15,840
vary uh every organization is slightly

95
00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:17,120
different every organization works

96
00:03:17,120 --> 00:03:18,400
slightly differently

97
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:20,560
not every idea might work for

98
00:03:20,560 --> 00:03:22,560
every organization but

99
00:03:22,560 --> 00:03:24,480
i certainly hope that some of the ideas

100
00:03:24,480 --> 00:03:26,159
i talk about today will be useful for

101
00:03:26,159 --> 00:03:27,519
you

102
00:03:27,519 --> 00:03:30,080
um before i get started on the ideas

103
00:03:30,080 --> 00:03:32,640
themselves quick revision on some of the

104
00:03:32,640 --> 00:03:33,440
key

105
00:03:33,440 --> 00:03:35,519
application security scanning tools

106
00:03:35,519 --> 00:03:38,879
so sca software composition analysis

107
00:03:38,879 --> 00:03:40,319
i guess the key aspect here is it's

108
00:03:40,319 --> 00:03:41,680
looking at the libraries that your

109
00:03:41,680 --> 00:03:44,000
product is using it's looking at the uh

110
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:45,519
the third party code that you're using

111
00:03:45,519 --> 00:03:46,720
and telling you about known

112
00:03:46,720 --> 00:03:48,319
vulnerabilities in those libraries you

113
00:03:48,319 --> 00:03:50,000
have a issue in this version you need to

114
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:52,000
upgrade to that version um this is

115
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:53,360
something that's happening in in library

116
00:03:53,360 --> 00:03:54,799
code in third party code so it's not

117
00:03:54,799 --> 00:03:56,000
code that you've written its code that

118
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:57,760
you've brought in from somewhere else

119
00:03:57,760 --> 00:04:00,239
and you're scanning that at coding time

120
00:04:00,239 --> 00:04:01,360
you know whilst you're actually writing

121
00:04:01,360 --> 00:04:02,799
you don't need to have an application

122
00:04:02,799 --> 00:04:05,360
running in order to do this

123
00:04:05,360 --> 00:04:08,080
sas static application screw testing

124
00:04:08,080 --> 00:04:09,519
that is scanning our code that is

125
00:04:09,519 --> 00:04:11,040
scanning the code that we've written to

126
00:04:11,040 --> 00:04:13,439
look for vulnerabilities look for issues

127
00:04:13,439 --> 00:04:15,120
this is also happening at coding time

128
00:04:15,120 --> 00:04:16,560
this is something usually you can do

129
00:04:16,560 --> 00:04:18,238
without the application running possibly

130
00:04:18,238 --> 00:04:20,160
even without the application compiling

131
00:04:20,160 --> 00:04:22,000
you just scan the code and find issues

132
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:23,840
find vulnerabilities in the code that

133
00:04:23,840 --> 00:04:26,240
you've written

134
00:04:26,240 --> 00:04:28,639
so dast dynamic application

135
00:04:28,639 --> 00:04:31,040
uh screw testing it sounds similar but

136
00:04:31,040 --> 00:04:32,639
it's more from it's more from outside

137
00:04:32,639 --> 00:04:33,600
it's more

138
00:04:33,600 --> 00:04:36,240
um simulating a real user trying to find

139
00:04:36,240 --> 00:04:37,520
vulnerabilities

140
00:04:37,520 --> 00:04:38,880
in the application so you need the

141
00:04:38,880 --> 00:04:40,720
application to be running you need the

142
00:04:40,720 --> 00:04:42,639
dash needs to be able to work with the

143
00:04:42,639 --> 00:04:44,000
application

144
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:46,800
via http as if it's uh you know as if

145
00:04:46,800 --> 00:04:48,240
they're a real user to try and find

146
00:04:48,240 --> 00:04:49,680
vulnerabilities

147
00:04:49,680 --> 00:04:51,759
um and that's an automated process well

148
00:04:51,759 --> 00:04:52,639
there's also which isn't really a

149
00:04:52,639 --> 00:04:54,240
testing tool but it comes up a lot in

150
00:04:54,240 --> 00:04:56,400
this context is penetration testing

151
00:04:56,400 --> 00:04:58,720
which is looking for

152
00:04:58,720 --> 00:05:00,800
also at runtime while the code is

153
00:05:00,800 --> 00:05:02,880
running the application needs to run

154
00:05:02,880 --> 00:05:04,400
looking for application looking for

155
00:05:04,400 --> 00:05:05,840
vulnerabilities but we're talking about

156
00:05:05,840 --> 00:05:06,560
uh

157
00:05:06,560 --> 00:05:08,240
a you know a real person should be doing

158
00:05:08,240 --> 00:05:09,680
this a real person is sat there manually

159
00:05:09,680 --> 00:05:10,800
thinking okay how can i break this

160
00:05:10,800 --> 00:05:12,800
application how can i find or prove

161
00:05:12,800 --> 00:05:15,759
vulnerability in this application

162
00:05:15,759 --> 00:05:17,520
so first of all if you want a lot of

163
00:05:17,520 --> 00:05:18,720
great information about dust i'm not

164
00:05:18,720 --> 00:05:20,400
going to go into too much detail because

165
00:05:20,400 --> 00:05:21,520
tanya

166
00:05:21,520 --> 00:05:23,600
did a great talk earlier on specifically

167
00:05:23,600 --> 00:05:26,560
about dast and so very similar to uh

168
00:05:26,560 --> 00:05:27,520
some of the other things i'm talking

169
00:05:27,520 --> 00:05:30,240
about here for sca and sas so

170
00:05:30,240 --> 00:05:31,600
certainly check out that talk if you're

171
00:05:31,600 --> 00:05:32,880
interested

172
00:05:32,880 --> 00:05:34,000
um

173
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:35,759
penetration testing i've spoken about

174
00:05:35,759 --> 00:05:37,039
length before i'm not going to speak

175
00:05:37,039 --> 00:05:39,120
about now but you can check out a talk

176
00:05:39,120 --> 00:05:40,479
that i did previously that's something

177
00:05:40,479 --> 00:05:42,080
that's interesting to you

178
00:05:42,080 --> 00:05:43,280
most of the

179
00:05:43,280 --> 00:05:46,400
upcoming topics here are going to focus

180
00:05:46,400 --> 00:05:49,759
on either sca or on

181
00:05:49,759 --> 00:05:50,800
sas

182
00:05:50,800 --> 00:05:52,400
some might be very very relevant to dust

183
00:05:52,400 --> 00:05:53,440
as well but

184
00:05:53,440 --> 00:05:55,520
that's the most uh yeah most of them

185
00:05:55,520 --> 00:05:57,360
focused around that and you know there

186
00:05:57,360 --> 00:05:58,800
is a lot that could be said here i could

187
00:05:58,800 --> 00:06:00,319
talk for a very long time about this you

188
00:06:00,319 --> 00:06:02,160
know my training course i do talk for a

189
00:06:02,160 --> 00:06:04,000
long time about this um because i think

190
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:05,360
there's a lot of detail to go into and a

191
00:06:05,360 --> 00:06:06,560
lot of

192
00:06:06,560 --> 00:06:09,360
information you can gather to help you

193
00:06:09,360 --> 00:06:11,840
better get scripted with these tools

194
00:06:11,840 --> 00:06:14,560
but uh i've chosen a few key points i

195
00:06:14,560 --> 00:06:16,639
want to get through um focusing on how

196
00:06:16,639 --> 00:06:18,160
does the tool work as in sort of

197
00:06:18,160 --> 00:06:19,759
understanding all what's actually going

198
00:06:19,759 --> 00:06:22,000
on in this tool what sort of features

199
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:23,120
are going to be useful to me in this

200
00:06:23,120 --> 00:06:24,240
tool

201
00:06:24,240 --> 00:06:25,840
how am i using the tool so how am i

202
00:06:25,840 --> 00:06:27,759
configuring it how can i work with it or

203
00:06:27,759 --> 00:06:29,840
what processes should i have with it

204
00:06:29,840 --> 00:06:32,080
and how am i fixing issues some ideas

205
00:06:32,080 --> 00:06:34,400
for what can we do to actually deal with

206
00:06:34,400 --> 00:06:36,000
the issues that are coming out of these

207
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:37,120
tools

208
00:06:37,120 --> 00:06:39,280
so let's dive into the first section how

209
00:06:39,280 --> 00:06:42,000
does it all work

210
00:06:42,479 --> 00:06:44,639
so

211
00:06:44,720 --> 00:06:46,560
first of all difficult matches this is

212
00:06:46,560 --> 00:06:48,240
more of an sca thing but i think it's

213
00:06:48,240 --> 00:06:50,000
quite fundamental

214
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:51,919
now it may be that you've got a very

215
00:06:51,919 --> 00:06:53,360
very sort of modern application and

216
00:06:53,360 --> 00:06:55,360
using a package manager your package

217
00:06:55,360 --> 00:06:57,440
manager has a manifest that says exactly

218
00:06:57,440 --> 00:06:59,360
what libraries are being used

219
00:06:59,360 --> 00:07:00,319
um

220
00:07:00,319 --> 00:07:01,680
which libraries have been brought in

221
00:07:01,680 --> 00:07:03,759
which versions of those libraries

222
00:07:03,759 --> 00:07:05,280
and you know that's fantastic if you've

223
00:07:05,280 --> 00:07:07,520
got that that's great and the tool like

224
00:07:07,520 --> 00:07:09,039
software competition analysis tool will

225
00:07:09,039 --> 00:07:10,960
certainly look at that and uh use that

226
00:07:10,960 --> 00:07:12,960
to tell you what issues you might have

227
00:07:12,960 --> 00:07:14,160
in your libraries or vulnerabilities you

228
00:07:14,160 --> 00:07:16,400
might have in your libraries but what if

229
00:07:16,400 --> 00:07:17,840
you don't have that what if you're

230
00:07:17,840 --> 00:07:19,440
dealing with some sort of older legacy

231
00:07:19,440 --> 00:07:21,680
application maybe the package manager

232
00:07:21,680 --> 00:07:24,639
only covers part of it maybe

233
00:07:24,639 --> 00:07:25,919
yeah it doesn't have a package manager

234
00:07:25,919 --> 00:07:27,759
at all maybe it's a lot older and it's

235
00:07:27,759 --> 00:07:29,520
built up over a period of time i've seen

236
00:07:29,520 --> 00:07:31,919
applications where they've built a very

237
00:07:31,919 --> 00:07:33,680
very large monolithic web application

238
00:07:33,680 --> 00:07:35,280
they've pulled in javascript libraries

239
00:07:35,280 --> 00:07:36,639
from here from there from everywhere

240
00:07:36,639 --> 00:07:37,680
else they've

241
00:07:37,680 --> 00:07:39,120
you know stuck them

242
00:07:39,120 --> 00:07:40,560
all over the pace with an application

243
00:07:40,560 --> 00:07:42,000
one person like to store javascript in

244
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:42,960
this folder one person like school

245
00:07:42,960 --> 00:07:44,800
javascript in this folder

246
00:07:44,800 --> 00:07:46,479
and

247
00:07:46,479 --> 00:07:47,360
if you're just looking at package

248
00:07:47,360 --> 00:07:48,400
manager that's obviously not gonna be

249
00:07:48,400 --> 00:07:49,440
enough you wanna make sure that your

250
00:07:49,440 --> 00:07:50,800
tool can look in other places as well

251
00:07:50,800 --> 00:07:51,680
you know what it's gonna do if there's

252
00:07:51,680 --> 00:07:53,360
no package manifest

253
00:07:53,360 --> 00:07:56,319
um some tools will look for a particular

254
00:07:56,319 --> 00:07:58,080
location on disk or in a particular

255
00:07:58,080 --> 00:07:59,520
folder structure what if that folder

256
00:07:59,520 --> 00:08:00,879
structure is in there what if you know

257
00:08:00,879 --> 00:08:02,720
what if just the library is there what

258
00:08:02,720 --> 00:08:03,840
if someone has changed the name of the

259
00:08:03,840 --> 00:08:05,520
file that the library is in what if

260
00:08:05,520 --> 00:08:06,800
they've changed the checksum you know

261
00:08:06,800 --> 00:08:08,240
they updated something manually within

262
00:08:08,240 --> 00:08:09,919
the file even it's just a comment and

263
00:08:09,919 --> 00:08:11,360
suddenly the checksum isn't the same

264
00:08:11,360 --> 00:08:13,039
maybe the tool is relying on that

265
00:08:13,039 --> 00:08:15,120
checksum to identify the library

266
00:08:15,120 --> 00:08:16,800
what happens if someone has minified a

267
00:08:16,800 --> 00:08:18,400
bunch of libraries they've bung them all

268
00:08:18,400 --> 00:08:20,639
together into one file and suddenly it's

269
00:08:20,639 --> 00:08:22,400
not you know four libraries and four

270
00:08:22,400 --> 00:08:25,280
files it's four libraries in one file

271
00:08:25,280 --> 00:08:26,879
so it's important to understand whether

272
00:08:26,879 --> 00:08:28,400
you know that is a situation for you

273
00:08:28,400 --> 00:08:30,000
whether that is something you're seeing

274
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:31,280
and whether your tool can handle that

275
00:08:31,280 --> 00:08:32,958
because if it can't it's going to become

276
00:08:32,958 --> 00:08:35,279
a lot more difficult to be able to

277
00:08:35,279 --> 00:08:36,719
identify what libraries you're actually

278
00:08:36,719 --> 00:08:38,479
using and you run the risk of false

279
00:08:38,479 --> 00:08:41,479
negatives

280
00:08:43,200 --> 00:08:44,720
so this is

281
00:08:44,720 --> 00:08:47,120
a widely applicable issue

282
00:08:47,120 --> 00:08:48,880
what do i actually need to do to get a

283
00:08:48,880 --> 00:08:51,040
scan what do i need to do to scan

284
00:08:51,040 --> 00:08:52,560
my application

285
00:08:52,560 --> 00:08:55,200
so some scanners will work on uncompiled

286
00:08:55,200 --> 00:08:58,000
on uncompilable code any code fragment

287
00:08:58,000 --> 00:08:59,920
you can scan the code fragment and find

288
00:08:59,920 --> 00:09:01,360
what you need

289
00:09:01,360 --> 00:09:02,800
some scanners might require the code to

290
00:09:02,800 --> 00:09:04,000
compile they might want to compile it

291
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:06,320
themselves in order to get more

292
00:09:06,320 --> 00:09:08,080
information about the code or how the

293
00:09:08,080 --> 00:09:09,600
code works

294
00:09:09,600 --> 00:09:11,120
if that's the case that's fine that's

295
00:09:11,120 --> 00:09:13,760
okay but then you do need to be able to

296
00:09:13,760 --> 00:09:15,360
you can't start this too early you have

297
00:09:15,360 --> 00:09:17,040
to you can only start scanning once

298
00:09:17,040 --> 00:09:18,399
you've got some sort of compilable

299
00:09:18,399 --> 00:09:20,800
object

300
00:09:20,959 --> 00:09:22,399
there are some scanners where you might

301
00:09:22,399 --> 00:09:23,920
want it might actually want to binaries

302
00:09:23,920 --> 00:09:25,839
it might want your code to compile to

303
00:09:25,839 --> 00:09:27,440
binaries

304
00:09:27,440 --> 00:09:28,880
yeah and maybe that needs to be done in

305
00:09:28,880 --> 00:09:30,160
a special way maybe it's not the same

306
00:09:30,160 --> 00:09:32,160
way as you usually package them for your

307
00:09:32,160 --> 00:09:34,640
own testing or if your own uh ci cd and

308
00:09:34,640 --> 00:09:36,320
maybe they need to be packaged in a

309
00:09:36,320 --> 00:09:37,760
particular way

310
00:09:37,760 --> 00:09:38,720
that's something to bear in mind that's

311
00:09:38,720 --> 00:09:39,680
something you want to keep an eye on

312
00:09:39,680 --> 00:09:41,920
because it will very much affect how you

313
00:09:41,920 --> 00:09:43,040
perform the scanning and where you

314
00:09:43,040 --> 00:09:45,279
perform the scanning if you can't

315
00:09:45,279 --> 00:09:47,680
perform the scanning until you've got

316
00:09:47,680 --> 00:09:49,760
fully compatible code and

317
00:09:49,760 --> 00:09:51,360
most of the code already there that

318
00:09:51,360 --> 00:09:53,680
might slow things down um compared to be

319
00:09:53,680 --> 00:09:55,120
able to run it you know in the browser

320
00:09:55,120 --> 00:09:57,279
or uncompliant in the id on uncomparable

321
00:09:57,279 --> 00:09:59,120
code

322
00:09:59,120 --> 00:10:01,519
alternatively if you need to compile it

323
00:10:01,519 --> 00:10:03,040
in a certain way but you're hoping to

324
00:10:03,040 --> 00:10:04,800
put it in line in your cisd that might

325
00:10:04,800 --> 00:10:06,560
not work it might be you have to have a

326
00:10:06,560 --> 00:10:08,800
branch off your cicd that compiles the

327
00:10:08,800 --> 00:10:09,920
code in the particular way that the

328
00:10:09,920 --> 00:10:11,839
scanner needs which i think that's fine

329
00:10:11,839 --> 00:10:12,959
it's not a big deal but you need to be

330
00:10:12,959 --> 00:10:14,560
prepared for that you need to be ready

331
00:10:14,560 --> 00:10:16,480
to

332
00:10:16,480 --> 00:10:19,839
configure your ci cd accordingly

333
00:10:21,680 --> 00:10:22,880
so

334
00:10:22,880 --> 00:10:24,320
we talk a lot about the software

335
00:10:24,320 --> 00:10:25,440
composition analysis okay you'll

336
00:10:25,440 --> 00:10:26,560
discover this vulnerability in this

337
00:10:26,560 --> 00:10:28,640
library you'll discover you know this

338
00:10:28,640 --> 00:10:30,079
issue you can go through the reports you

339
00:10:30,079 --> 00:10:32,959
can figure out what's going on

340
00:10:32,959 --> 00:10:34,959
but what happens when

341
00:10:34,959 --> 00:10:36,640
you know there's a very urgent very

342
00:10:36,640 --> 00:10:38,240
immediate issue that you need to deal

343
00:10:38,240 --> 00:10:39,440
with

344
00:10:39,440 --> 00:10:42,079
and look for j is a overused and classic

345
00:10:42,079 --> 00:10:44,079
example you know i was seeing

346
00:10:44,079 --> 00:10:45,519
information about that on twitter on a

347
00:10:45,519 --> 00:10:46,560
friday morning and i was already

348
00:10:46,560 --> 00:10:48,000
messaging teams but you know if you're

349
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:49,360
going to be waiting

350
00:10:49,360 --> 00:10:51,120
for

351
00:10:51,120 --> 00:10:53,279
your scanner's database to update and

352
00:10:53,279 --> 00:10:54,800
then to run a scan and then to get the

353
00:10:54,800 --> 00:10:56,880
report and then look through the results

354
00:10:56,880 --> 00:10:58,160
that's not going to be fast enough you

355
00:10:58,160 --> 00:10:59,680
need a way of being able to deal with

356
00:10:59,680 --> 00:11:01,600
these more urgent issues as well you

357
00:11:01,600 --> 00:11:02,959
know this sort of third-party library

358
00:11:02,959 --> 00:11:05,440
risk you certainly want a tool to manage

359
00:11:05,440 --> 00:11:07,440
it on an overall basis but how are you

360
00:11:07,440 --> 00:11:09,519
getting that up-to-date information how

361
00:11:09,519 --> 00:11:11,600
are you gonna get that okay you need to

362
00:11:11,600 --> 00:11:13,360
do this right now

363
00:11:13,360 --> 00:11:14,880
uh maybe you have a threat intelligence

364
00:11:14,880 --> 00:11:16,640
provider who can help you with that um

365
00:11:16,640 --> 00:11:18,399
maybe your sca vendor can actually give

366
00:11:18,399 --> 00:11:19,440
that to you maybe they have that

367
00:11:19,440 --> 00:11:21,200
information for you um for an

368
00:11:21,200 --> 00:11:22,720
alternative channel

369
00:11:22,720 --> 00:11:24,959
um i'm gonna get laughter if i say

370
00:11:24,959 --> 00:11:26,959
twitter but it's not a terrible way of

371
00:11:26,959 --> 00:11:28,240
finding out what's going on twitter's a

372
00:11:28,240 --> 00:11:29,440
very good way of finding out what's

373
00:11:29,440 --> 00:11:31,920
going on in the security world uh very

374
00:11:31,920 --> 00:11:34,000
uh up to the minute

375
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:36,000
or other people's security blogs or you

376
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:38,320
know other sources of information

377
00:11:38,320 --> 00:11:39,839
what will help though

378
00:11:39,839 --> 00:11:42,160
is if your sca tool is preparing some

379
00:11:42,160 --> 00:11:44,079
sort of inventory or software builder

380
00:11:44,079 --> 00:11:45,760
materials then that's going to make it a

381
00:11:45,760 --> 00:11:47,279
lot easier to investigate this sort of

382
00:11:47,279 --> 00:11:50,000
issue and to discover you am i actually

383
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:51,760
using this library where am i using this

384
00:11:51,760 --> 00:11:52,720
library

385
00:11:52,720 --> 00:11:53,920
so that's certainly something to bear in

386
00:11:53,920 --> 00:11:56,639
mind

387
00:11:56,639 --> 00:11:57,920
so next i want to talk about the

388
00:11:57,920 --> 00:12:01,760
usability and the the interface

389
00:12:04,480 --> 00:12:05,160
so

390
00:12:05,160 --> 00:12:08,539
[Music]

391
00:12:08,880 --> 00:12:10,240
there's very much an idea that you know

392
00:12:10,240 --> 00:12:12,399
we want to try and bring

393
00:12:12,399 --> 00:12:13,839
information from these tools into a

394
00:12:13,839 --> 00:12:15,279
developer interface into something sort

395
00:12:15,279 --> 00:12:17,519
of ticketing system that they are

396
00:12:17,519 --> 00:12:18,959
used to already that they're not having

397
00:12:18,959 --> 00:12:20,160
to look at a different pane of glass

398
00:12:20,160 --> 00:12:21,279
they're just looking where they usually

399
00:12:21,279 --> 00:12:23,519
look

400
00:12:23,680 --> 00:12:25,440
i think that's fine i think that you

401
00:12:25,440 --> 00:12:26,720
should get there that's certainly the

402
00:12:26,720 --> 00:12:28,160
direction you want to go in but it's not

403
00:12:28,160 --> 00:12:29,920
necessarily where you're going to start

404
00:12:29,920 --> 00:12:31,680
and i think you are going to spend time

405
00:12:31,680 --> 00:12:33,519
having to look through the interface of

406
00:12:33,519 --> 00:12:35,440
this tool to make sure that

407
00:12:35,440 --> 00:12:38,240
first of all you understand

408
00:12:38,240 --> 00:12:39,600
exactly what's going on with particular

409
00:12:39,600 --> 00:12:41,200
finding you may need to go through this

410
00:12:41,200 --> 00:12:43,279
interface in order to get rid of a whole

411
00:12:43,279 --> 00:12:45,360
load of initial results that uh you know

412
00:12:45,360 --> 00:12:47,680
trim down some of the noise

413
00:12:47,680 --> 00:12:49,440
you may need some of the more advanced

414
00:12:49,440 --> 00:12:50,639
features that these interface might

415
00:12:50,639 --> 00:12:53,279
provide if you've done a sas scan and

416
00:12:53,279 --> 00:12:54,399
you've

417
00:12:54,399 --> 00:12:56,639
got a finding relating to some sort of

418
00:12:56,639 --> 00:12:58,959
code flow where input comes in here goes

419
00:12:58,959 --> 00:13:01,120
through these 14 functions and then goes

420
00:13:01,120 --> 00:13:03,600
to uh get exploited an exploitable

421
00:13:03,600 --> 00:13:05,279
function further down

422
00:13:05,279 --> 00:13:06,320
you're not going to capture that in a

423
00:13:06,320 --> 00:13:07,920
ticket very easily you probably are

424
00:13:07,920 --> 00:13:08,800
going to need to go back to the

425
00:13:08,800 --> 00:13:10,560
interface to understand that

426
00:13:10,560 --> 00:13:11,600
so you want to make sure that whatever

427
00:13:11,600 --> 00:13:14,320
tool you're using the interface is

428
00:13:14,320 --> 00:13:16,639
usable you need to work with that and be

429
00:13:16,639 --> 00:13:18,399
able to feel comfortable working with it

430
00:13:18,399 --> 00:13:20,959
um just relying on on tickets and some

431
00:13:20,959 --> 00:13:22,720
other system is probably not going to be

432
00:13:22,720 --> 00:13:26,880
enough for every use case

433
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:30,880
so that's some thoughts about um

434
00:13:30,880 --> 00:13:32,880
i guess features of the tool but

435
00:13:32,880 --> 00:13:34,079
so what happens when we come to use this

436
00:13:34,079 --> 00:13:35,040
tool we need to think about we're

437
00:13:35,040 --> 00:13:37,760
actually using it

438
00:13:40,079 --> 00:13:42,000
so

439
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:43,760
in any sort of reasonable sized

440
00:13:43,760 --> 00:13:45,519
organization

441
00:13:45,519 --> 00:13:46,880
if you try and bring in a tool like this

442
00:13:46,880 --> 00:13:48,480
or you're using a tool like this

443
00:13:48,480 --> 00:13:49,839
someone's going to want to know how are

444
00:13:49,839 --> 00:13:52,399
we doing you know how

445
00:13:52,399 --> 00:13:53,920
are we performing you know are we

446
00:13:53,920 --> 00:13:55,680
improving are things getting better you

447
00:13:55,680 --> 00:13:58,480
know is the smile you know is the smiley

448
00:13:58,480 --> 00:14:01,519
face up or is the face yeah pointed down

449
00:14:01,519 --> 00:14:01,930
um

450
00:14:01,930 --> 00:14:03,760
[Music]

451
00:14:03,760 --> 00:14:05,360
if you don't

452
00:14:05,360 --> 00:14:07,360
i suppose decide up front what you want

453
00:14:07,360 --> 00:14:08,560
to measure and how you want to decide

454
00:14:08,560 --> 00:14:10,079
this somewhat someone's going to decide

455
00:14:10,079 --> 00:14:11,920
it for you someone's going to

456
00:14:11,920 --> 00:14:13,199
look at a number say that's now the

457
00:14:13,199 --> 00:14:15,360
number that we rely on and all our kpis

458
00:14:15,360 --> 00:14:16,639
and all of our

459
00:14:16,639 --> 00:14:19,040
business processes and assessments and

460
00:14:19,040 --> 00:14:20,399
uh

461
00:14:20,399 --> 00:14:22,240
enforcement is going to revolve around

462
00:14:22,240 --> 00:14:23,519
this number so it's something that's

463
00:14:23,519 --> 00:14:24,959
important to think about upfront make

464
00:14:24,959 --> 00:14:26,160
sure you know how we're going to measure

465
00:14:26,160 --> 00:14:29,800
our progress in this

466
00:14:30,240 --> 00:14:32,959
so in terms of how is the tool doing

467
00:14:32,959 --> 00:14:34,079
which is

468
00:14:34,079 --> 00:14:35,440
it'll see it's definitely an important

469
00:14:35,440 --> 00:14:36,639
part of this

470
00:14:36,639 --> 00:14:38,160
um you may want to look at the the

471
00:14:38,160 --> 00:14:39,920
quality of the data that you're getting

472
00:14:39,920 --> 00:14:41,279
from the vendor you know how good is

473
00:14:41,279 --> 00:14:43,040
this tool how good is the data again

474
00:14:43,040 --> 00:14:44,399
from the vendor you know how much

475
00:14:44,399 --> 00:14:45,279
information we're getting that we

476
00:14:45,279 --> 00:14:46,480
couldn't get somewhere else if this is

477
00:14:46,480 --> 00:14:48,800
an sca tool how many vulnerabilities are

478
00:14:48,800 --> 00:14:50,959
we seeing that we don't see in nvd or

479
00:14:50,959 --> 00:14:52,880
which have additional information that

480
00:14:52,880 --> 00:14:54,399
help us make better decisions that we

481
00:14:54,399 --> 00:14:56,079
wouldn't see in you know a publicly

482
00:14:56,079 --> 00:14:59,360
available data source um

483
00:14:59,360 --> 00:15:00,560
how long does it take to actually run

484
00:15:00,560 --> 00:15:02,000
these scans is this slowing us down is

485
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:05,120
this causing everyone big headaches um

486
00:15:05,120 --> 00:15:06,880
yeah we don't want to make people sad

487
00:15:06,880 --> 00:15:07,839
with this we don't want to make

488
00:15:07,839 --> 00:15:08,800
especially we don't want to make

489
00:15:08,800 --> 00:15:10,000
developers out we don't want them to

490
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:12,000
associate the security tool with a bad

491
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:14,800
experience or a slow experience

492
00:15:14,800 --> 00:15:15,839
uh we might want to consider how

493
00:15:15,839 --> 00:15:17,360
accurate is the tool how you know what's

494
00:15:17,360 --> 00:15:19,040
the ratio of

495
00:15:19,040 --> 00:15:21,360
uh false positives that we're seeing to

496
00:15:21,360 --> 00:15:22,800
compare to real

497
00:15:22,800 --> 00:15:24,000
results

498
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:25,839
are we identifying false negatives you

499
00:15:25,839 --> 00:15:27,600
know classic example might be if you do

500
00:15:27,600 --> 00:15:29,519
a penetration test for example somewhere

501
00:15:29,519 --> 00:15:30,480
down the line and they find a

502
00:15:30,480 --> 00:15:31,920
vulnerability and you're like well

503
00:15:31,920 --> 00:15:33,600
that's weird why didn't the sas tool

504
00:15:33,600 --> 00:15:35,680
find out maybe you discover that uh your

505
00:15:35,680 --> 00:15:37,759
sas tool just didn't pick up nice it

506
00:15:37,759 --> 00:15:38,880
should have seen this in the code it

507
00:15:38,880 --> 00:15:40,240
didn't that's something the example of

508
00:15:40,240 --> 00:15:42,399
false negative but sca tools that might

509
00:15:42,399 --> 00:15:43,920
be missed libraries okay we know we use

510
00:15:43,920 --> 00:15:45,440
this library but we're not seeing it

511
00:15:45,440 --> 00:15:48,399
here or why not

512
00:15:48,399 --> 00:15:50,639
um and again we're thinking of ways we

513
00:15:50,639 --> 00:15:52,160
can track you know how is this tool

514
00:15:52,160 --> 00:15:54,160
working for us is it doing well for us

515
00:15:54,160 --> 00:15:56,000
if we are seeing that we're not getting

516
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:57,839
the value from rental we're not getting

517
00:15:57,839 --> 00:15:59,600
um the speed from it or we're not

518
00:15:59,600 --> 00:16:02,320
getting the uh the accuracy that we need

519
00:16:02,320 --> 00:16:03,680
that might be an indicator that the tool

520
00:16:03,680 --> 00:16:07,800
isn't doing what we needed to do

521
00:16:09,199 --> 00:16:10,160
so

522
00:16:10,160 --> 00:16:11,519
the other side of this is how are we

523
00:16:11,519 --> 00:16:13,199
doing you know are we

524
00:16:13,199 --> 00:16:14,560
performing well are we managing to

525
00:16:14,560 --> 00:16:16,240
progress on the findings that are coming

526
00:16:16,240 --> 00:16:17,680
out of this

527
00:16:17,680 --> 00:16:19,600
now it's very easy to just look at a

528
00:16:19,600 --> 00:16:21,120
very sort of okay this is the current

529
00:16:21,120 --> 00:16:22,399
number in the tool and this is how we're

530
00:16:22,399 --> 00:16:23,680
doing if that number goes down then it's

531
00:16:23,680 --> 00:16:26,320
good if that number goes up it's bad

532
00:16:26,320 --> 00:16:27,440
it's certainly more complicated than

533
00:16:27,440 --> 00:16:30,000
this i think i'd certainly recommend

534
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:31,600
saying what do we expect to happen

535
00:16:31,600 --> 00:16:33,519
what's up what's our commitment you know

536
00:16:33,519 --> 00:16:35,839
how fast do we expect to fix things or

537
00:16:35,839 --> 00:16:37,360
you know within what service level

538
00:16:37,360 --> 00:16:40,000
agreement we expect to fix things

539
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:41,120
and then

540
00:16:41,120 --> 00:16:42,639
bring out numbers that compare

541
00:16:42,639 --> 00:16:44,160
performance to that so they've got some

542
00:16:44,160 --> 00:16:45,600
sort of baseline expectation rather than

543
00:16:45,600 --> 00:16:46,639
just looking does number got those

544
00:16:46,639 --> 00:16:48,800
numbers go down

545
00:16:48,800 --> 00:16:50,480
i'd strongly suggest splitting out

546
00:16:50,480 --> 00:16:52,240
between what are these issues and new

547
00:16:52,240 --> 00:16:53,360
issues and what are these issues of

548
00:16:53,360 --> 00:16:54,639
fixed issues you know it's not just a

549
00:16:54,639 --> 00:16:56,639
number of changes also how many do we

550
00:16:56,639 --> 00:16:58,720
fix and how many are new so we know okay

551
00:16:58,720 --> 00:17:00,639
we made progress but there are new

552
00:17:00,639 --> 00:17:01,839
vulnerabilities that come up maybe the

553
00:17:01,839 --> 00:17:04,160
database got updated maybe new

554
00:17:04,160 --> 00:17:05,119
vulnerabilities came out for a

555
00:17:05,119 --> 00:17:06,559
particular package

556
00:17:06,559 --> 00:17:07,839
so yeah we want to capture that

557
00:17:07,839 --> 00:17:08,959
information otherwise it could be quite

558
00:17:08,959 --> 00:17:10,400
demoralizing if we just see a number

559
00:17:10,400 --> 00:17:11,760
going up without capturing the fact

560
00:17:11,760 --> 00:17:13,039
we'll actually did a lot of work to fix

561
00:17:13,039 --> 00:17:16,000
things this time around

562
00:17:16,160 --> 00:17:18,160
it's worth tracking how how we fixing

563
00:17:18,160 --> 00:17:19,839
these issues if we're doing a proper

564
00:17:19,839 --> 00:17:21,839
remediation or an upgrade which i guess

565
00:17:21,839 --> 00:17:24,000
would be the uh you know the best option

566
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:26,559
for sas and for sca where we actively

567
00:17:26,559 --> 00:17:28,319
fix it in the way that tool expects and

568
00:17:28,319 --> 00:17:30,160
that's great if we're if i happen to use

569
00:17:30,160 --> 00:17:33,039
some sort of other mitigation um

570
00:17:33,039 --> 00:17:35,120
some other method of making this better

571
00:17:35,120 --> 00:17:36,559
that's not the exact way we're supposed

572
00:17:36,559 --> 00:17:37,760
to and we probably want to track that

573
00:17:37,760 --> 00:17:39,280
and just you know if we're always using

574
00:17:39,280 --> 00:17:41,280
mitigations and we're not using you know

575
00:17:41,280 --> 00:17:42,000
the

576
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:43,280
the best possible way the best

577
00:17:43,280 --> 00:17:44,400
remediation or we're not doing the

578
00:17:44,400 --> 00:17:47,039
upgrades then it might it might indicate

579
00:17:47,039 --> 00:17:48,000
that we're struggling a little bit with

580
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:50,080
our process and that we want to uh you

581
00:17:50,080 --> 00:17:51,360
know rethink how we're actually

582
00:17:51,360 --> 00:17:53,919
addressing these

583
00:17:53,919 --> 00:17:56,480
it's only just also picking out

584
00:17:56,480 --> 00:17:58,000
you know not just numbers of issues but

585
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:00,559
also what types of issues are we seeing

586
00:18:00,559 --> 00:18:02,160
you know we're seeing issues that occur

587
00:18:02,160 --> 00:18:04,559
over over and over again can we

588
00:18:04,559 --> 00:18:05,919
use this information to drive our

589
00:18:05,919 --> 00:18:07,360
training do we want to push our

590
00:18:07,360 --> 00:18:09,440
developers to uh

591
00:18:09,440 --> 00:18:10,799
you know spend some time learning about

592
00:18:10,799 --> 00:18:13,120
these particular areas if we do training

593
00:18:13,120 --> 00:18:14,799
we see these areas are still

594
00:18:14,799 --> 00:18:16,559
returning maybe there's another issue

595
00:18:16,559 --> 00:18:17,600
maybe the training isn't good enough

596
00:18:17,600 --> 00:18:18,640
maybe we

597
00:18:18,640 --> 00:18:20,080
um

598
00:18:20,080 --> 00:18:21,200
you know training hasn't given them the

599
00:18:21,200 --> 00:18:22,880
information they need it so certainly

600
00:18:22,880 --> 00:18:25,039
want to use this to

601
00:18:25,039 --> 00:18:26,640
improving our numbers here on isn't just

602
00:18:26,640 --> 00:18:27,919
about fixing things it's also about

603
00:18:27,919 --> 00:18:28,880
stopping them from happening in the

604
00:18:28,880 --> 00:18:29,919
first place

605
00:18:29,919 --> 00:18:31,520
and we can use measuring our performance

606
00:18:31,520 --> 00:18:34,160
to help with that

607
00:18:36,960 --> 00:18:38,240
so

608
00:18:38,240 --> 00:18:39,200
there are lots of different parts of

609
00:18:39,200 --> 00:18:40,400
this process here who's going to

610
00:18:40,400 --> 00:18:42,000
actually implement it in the first place

611
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:43,280
he's going to install the tool and set

612
00:18:43,280 --> 00:18:45,760
everything up and

613
00:18:45,760 --> 00:18:46,880
get everything running who's going to

614
00:18:46,880 --> 00:18:48,400
who's going to make sure the scans

615
00:18:48,400 --> 00:18:49,360
happen he's going to build those into

616
00:18:49,360 --> 00:18:50,799
the pipelines

617
00:18:50,799 --> 00:18:52,320
uh who's going to fix the issues he's

618
00:18:52,320 --> 00:18:53,440
going to deal with the issues when they

619
00:18:53,440 --> 00:18:55,600
when they come up with the findings

620
00:18:55,600 --> 00:18:57,440
and who's going to review the results

621
00:18:57,440 --> 00:18:59,120
and prioritize and say okay this is the

622
00:18:59,120 --> 00:19:00,080
order in which we're going to fix this

623
00:19:00,080 --> 00:19:02,879
is where we're going to start

624
00:19:03,200 --> 00:19:04,000
so

625
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:06,000
in a lot of organizations i think the

626
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:07,520
risk is that the answer to all those

627
00:19:07,520 --> 00:19:09,360
four sections is well the security

628
00:19:09,360 --> 00:19:11,039
person to do it

629
00:19:11,039 --> 00:19:12,799
um this is a security tool so it's a

630
00:19:12,799 --> 00:19:14,320
security job it's a job for the security

631
00:19:14,320 --> 00:19:16,480
person

632
00:19:16,480 --> 00:19:18,640
it's important to just share the love a

633
00:19:18,640 --> 00:19:19,840
little bit here

634
00:19:19,840 --> 00:19:21,280
you know everyone has a role to play

635
00:19:21,280 --> 00:19:22,070
here and

636
00:19:22,070 --> 00:19:23,440
[Music]

637
00:19:23,440 --> 00:19:25,200
by by expecting the security person to

638
00:19:25,200 --> 00:19:26,480
do all of these

639
00:19:26,480 --> 00:19:27,679
then i think they're pushing them

640
00:19:27,679 --> 00:19:29,360
outside of what they're actually good at

641
00:19:29,360 --> 00:19:30,799
and what they're you know what we should

642
00:19:30,799 --> 00:19:32,080
expect from them and

643
00:19:32,080 --> 00:19:33,440
i guess taking time away from them doing

644
00:19:33,440 --> 00:19:34,240
other

645
00:19:34,240 --> 00:19:36,320
more practical tasks that are suited to

646
00:19:36,320 --> 00:19:37,679
to what they want to be doing what those

647
00:19:37,679 --> 00:19:39,440
good people need to be doing to maintain

648
00:19:39,440 --> 00:19:40,960
the security of the product

649
00:19:40,960 --> 00:19:43,280
in terms of implementing yeah maybe need

650
00:19:43,280 --> 00:19:44,400
to be someone who's familiar with the

651
00:19:44,400 --> 00:19:46,640
tool for me with overall processes

652
00:19:46,640 --> 00:19:47,679
um

653
00:19:47,679 --> 00:19:50,840
but also yeah maybe more technical it

654
00:19:50,840 --> 00:19:52,559
style

655
00:19:52,559 --> 00:19:54,320
um

656
00:19:54,320 --> 00:19:56,000
yeah there's there's there's very much

657
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:57,840
sort of practical element there it may

658
00:19:57,840 --> 00:19:59,200
be that for particular policies

659
00:19:59,200 --> 00:20:00,240
particular configuration they want to

660
00:20:00,240 --> 00:20:01,360
consult with security if it's not

661
00:20:01,360 --> 00:20:04,159
necessarily a security function

662
00:20:04,159 --> 00:20:06,400
similarly for running and maintaining

663
00:20:06,400 --> 00:20:07,440
the scan

664
00:20:07,440 --> 00:20:09,440
so that's very much a devops job in

665
00:20:09,440 --> 00:20:10,960
terms of okay we need to put this into

666
00:20:10,960 --> 00:20:13,440
this pipeline we need to uh set this to

667
00:20:13,440 --> 00:20:15,039
run after this we need to get the

668
00:20:15,039 --> 00:20:16,000
results

669
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:17,280
pulled over to here and you're

670
00:20:17,280 --> 00:20:19,520
integrating into that again this isn't

671
00:20:19,520 --> 00:20:21,520
you know exactly how that happens or you

672
00:20:21,520 --> 00:20:23,120
know the specific configuration or the

673
00:20:23,120 --> 00:20:24,720
overall plan

674
00:20:24,720 --> 00:20:26,400
again can consult with security but the

675
00:20:26,400 --> 00:20:27,520
actual

676
00:20:27,520 --> 00:20:29,280
hands-on who's going to do that that's a

677
00:20:29,280 --> 00:20:31,918
devops thing

678
00:20:32,159 --> 00:20:33,520
in terms of reviewing and prioritizing

679
00:20:33,520 --> 00:20:35,440
results this is probably where you want

680
00:20:35,440 --> 00:20:37,760
the most time from your security person

681
00:20:37,760 --> 00:20:39,360
to be spent because this is where their

682
00:20:39,360 --> 00:20:41,200
knowledge really comes in and useful to

683
00:20:41,200 --> 00:20:42,400
understand okay here's where we need to

684
00:20:42,400 --> 00:20:44,000
start here's what we need to do first

685
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:45,039
here's where we need to start you know

686
00:20:45,039 --> 00:20:48,559
here's what's most risky to us

687
00:20:48,559 --> 00:20:49,840
because then when we get to fixing the

688
00:20:49,840 --> 00:20:51,760
issues you know that's ideally someone

689
00:20:51,760 --> 00:20:53,440
who's really familiar with the code the

690
00:20:53,440 --> 00:20:54,720
developer the architect someone who's

691
00:20:54,720 --> 00:20:55,840
new

692
00:20:55,840 --> 00:20:57,760
down in the weeds of how all this code

693
00:20:57,760 --> 00:20:58,960
works or

694
00:20:58,960 --> 00:21:00,880
and and can understand okay well this is

695
00:21:00,880 --> 00:21:02,000
what i need to do to make this work

696
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:03,679
better this fix will work this fix won't

697
00:21:03,679 --> 00:21:05,120
work and again everyone here can consult

698
00:21:05,120 --> 00:21:07,200
with a security person but we don't want

699
00:21:07,200 --> 00:21:09,039
to um

700
00:21:09,039 --> 00:21:10,159
expect that the crew person is going to

701
00:21:10,159 --> 00:21:12,000
do all of this because it's going to put

702
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:14,880
a significant burden on them and

703
00:21:14,880 --> 00:21:15,840
again they don't necessarily have the

704
00:21:15,840 --> 00:21:17,280
bandwidth for it

705
00:21:17,280 --> 00:21:19,120
i think it's also important to

706
00:21:19,120 --> 00:21:20,480
include everyone so that everyone feels

707
00:21:20,480 --> 00:21:21,600
they have some sort of involvement in

708
00:21:21,600 --> 00:21:22,799
buying because

709
00:21:22,799 --> 00:21:24,559
you know ultimately this is something to

710
00:21:24,559 --> 00:21:25,600
benefit everyone it's not just to

711
00:21:25,600 --> 00:21:28,399
benefit the security

712
00:21:28,840 --> 00:21:32,159
person and speaking of buying

713
00:21:32,159 --> 00:21:33,760
none of this is going to happen from the

714
00:21:33,760 --> 00:21:35,039
bottom up

715
00:21:35,039 --> 00:21:36,480
if you have security people sort of

716
00:21:36,480 --> 00:21:37,760
running around developers trying to get

717
00:21:37,760 --> 00:21:39,200
and start using this

718
00:21:39,200 --> 00:21:40,720
without any sort of

719
00:21:40,720 --> 00:21:42,159
management expectation that's actually

720
00:21:42,159 --> 00:21:43,280
what's going to happen

721
00:21:43,280 --> 00:21:44,559
it's not going to happen you know

722
00:21:44,559 --> 00:21:45,679
there's a

723
00:21:45,679 --> 00:21:47,520
you know another trope that security is

724
00:21:47,520 --> 00:21:49,600
everyone's job well

725
00:21:49,600 --> 00:21:51,039
everyone's job is what their job is you

726
00:21:51,039 --> 00:21:52,640
know their job is defined by their

727
00:21:52,640 --> 00:21:54,480
manager and the manager's manager

728
00:21:54,480 --> 00:21:56,880
defines what the manager's job is

729
00:21:56,880 --> 00:22:00,240
we very much take the cue from up top

730
00:22:00,240 --> 00:22:02,000
if management aren't pushing this if

731
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:04,400
this isn't clearly a priority for group

732
00:22:04,400 --> 00:22:07,600
leaders for vps of r d cto however it

733
00:22:07,600 --> 00:22:09,200
works out then

734
00:22:09,200 --> 00:22:10,880
you know it's not going to get done and

735
00:22:10,880 --> 00:22:11,679
i don't think this should be an

736
00:22:11,679 --> 00:22:12,960
expectation it's going to get done

737
00:22:12,960 --> 00:22:14,159
ultimately they don't want to define the

738
00:22:14,159 --> 00:22:16,000
priority it's certainly not after

739
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:18,320
security to to chase around and try and

740
00:22:18,320 --> 00:22:20,720
make this sort of thing work um

741
00:22:20,720 --> 00:22:22,080
it's another thing that's just going to

742
00:22:22,080 --> 00:22:25,280
create a negative view of security where

743
00:22:25,280 --> 00:22:27,120
security is seen as the police chasing

744
00:22:27,120 --> 00:22:29,919
around trying to um enforce the uh the

745
00:22:29,919 --> 00:22:30,799
law

746
00:22:30,799 --> 00:22:32,320
whereas they're not getting any backup

747
00:22:32,320 --> 00:22:34,400
they're not getting any input from

748
00:22:34,400 --> 00:22:36,240
the actual management of people who

749
00:22:36,240 --> 00:22:38,799
need to be doing

750
00:22:38,840 --> 00:22:41,360
this that means

751
00:22:41,360 --> 00:22:42,880
we need to make a way of measuring it so

752
00:22:42,880 --> 00:22:44,559
we need to make sure we understand is it

753
00:22:44,559 --> 00:22:46,480
happening is not happening are we on

754
00:22:46,480 --> 00:22:48,559
targets can we provide management with

755
00:22:48,559 --> 00:22:50,000
information showing that so they can

756
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:52,240
then take action if necessary

757
00:22:52,240 --> 00:22:53,919
and you know what's the process for

758
00:22:53,919 --> 00:22:55,280
saying that we can't do this right now

759
00:22:55,280 --> 00:22:56,320
we can't

760
00:22:56,320 --> 00:22:57,760
deal with this issue

761
00:22:57,760 --> 00:23:00,159
but we will deal with it then and yeah

762
00:23:00,159 --> 00:23:01,520
providing some sort of explanation about

763
00:23:01,520 --> 00:23:03,039
okay we can't do this now but we are

764
00:23:03,039 --> 00:23:04,720
going to do it next week next month next

765
00:23:04,720 --> 00:23:06,799
sprint however it needs to work out but

766
00:23:06,799 --> 00:23:09,200
let's it's a clear process that

767
00:23:09,200 --> 00:23:10,960
you know this is whoever needs to do

768
00:23:10,960 --> 00:23:12,080
this understands that is their

769
00:23:12,080 --> 00:23:13,600
responsibility to do it they have buying

770
00:23:13,600 --> 00:23:15,520
from their boss they can ask their boss

771
00:23:15,520 --> 00:23:17,679
to prioritize for them if necessary

772
00:23:17,679 --> 00:23:18,559
but

773
00:23:18,559 --> 00:23:19,520
it's something that's coming from their

774
00:23:19,520 --> 00:23:21,360
organization it's not just coming from

775
00:23:21,360 --> 00:23:24,799
security causing everyone a headache

776
00:23:27,360 --> 00:23:28,720
the final point here you know i

777
00:23:28,720 --> 00:23:30,559
mentioned how early can we do this if we

778
00:23:30,559 --> 00:23:32,799
can do this already in the id

779
00:23:32,799 --> 00:23:34,640
whilst the developer is writing a code

780
00:23:34,640 --> 00:23:37,360
then that's fantastic you know if we can

781
00:23:37,360 --> 00:23:38,640
once we've

782
00:23:38,640 --> 00:23:41,120
written code compiled code sent up to ci

783
00:23:41,120 --> 00:23:43,840
cd packaged it scanned it got a report

784
00:23:43,840 --> 00:23:45,840
send the report back to the developer

785
00:23:45,840 --> 00:23:46,960
you know who knows what developers

786
00:23:46,960 --> 00:23:48,400
thinking about next you know they've

787
00:23:48,400 --> 00:23:50,000
moved on to the next feature maybe it's

788
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:51,360
not thinking about it anymore depends

789
00:23:51,360 --> 00:23:52,720
how long it takes to come back if we can

790
00:23:52,720 --> 00:23:54,880
give them immediate feedback in the id

791
00:23:54,880 --> 00:23:56,159
that says look there you've just tried

792
00:23:56,159 --> 00:23:57,279
to use this function you just charge

793
00:23:57,279 --> 00:23:59,120
users library there is a problem you

794
00:23:59,120 --> 00:24:00,640
might want to you know look into this

795
00:24:00,640 --> 00:24:02,480
then they're already in that context of

796
00:24:02,480 --> 00:24:05,039
any in that mindset and

797
00:24:05,039 --> 00:24:06,400
you know they're much more likely to fix

798
00:24:06,400 --> 00:24:08,640
it there and then

799
00:24:08,640 --> 00:24:09,840
you're going to need to tune that you

800
00:24:09,840 --> 00:24:11,279
don't want to have too many sort of

801
00:24:11,279 --> 00:24:13,200
false alarms if you know they're

802
00:24:13,200 --> 00:24:14,799
constantly getting security pop-ups

803
00:24:14,799 --> 00:24:16,080
flashed up with them like this one that

804
00:24:16,080 --> 00:24:17,120
i made up

805
00:24:17,120 --> 00:24:19,679
then you know they're not going to

806
00:24:19,679 --> 00:24:21,440
want to deal with it they're going to

807
00:24:21,440 --> 00:24:23,039
say yeah continue to continue continuing

808
00:24:23,039 --> 00:24:24,320
continue let me get on with it no this

809
00:24:24,320 --> 00:24:26,240
is ever helpful anyway

810
00:24:26,240 --> 00:24:27,840
it needs to be targeted it needs to be

811
00:24:27,840 --> 00:24:29,919
well tuned but it can certainly catch a

812
00:24:29,919 --> 00:24:31,440
lot of things in the bud

813
00:24:31,440 --> 00:24:33,440
probably can't catch everything and

814
00:24:33,440 --> 00:24:35,120
there shouldn't be an expectation that

815
00:24:35,120 --> 00:24:36,720
everything's clean in the id then it

816
00:24:36,720 --> 00:24:38,480
will go to the report you know the full

817
00:24:38,480 --> 00:24:40,480
scan it'll be clean as well but it can

818
00:24:40,480 --> 00:24:42,000
certainly catch some of the the low

819
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:45,320
hanging fruit

820
00:24:46,480 --> 00:24:48,000
so that brings us on to you know the

821
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:49,679
more specifics about how we actually

822
00:24:49,679 --> 00:24:51,600
fixing these issues what do we have can

823
00:24:51,600 --> 00:24:53,120
you how can we actually do this in a

824
00:24:53,120 --> 00:24:55,918
more efficient way

825
00:24:57,120 --> 00:24:58,559
so the first thing i say is you do not

826
00:24:58,559 --> 00:25:00,080
want to switch everything on at once do

827
00:25:00,080 --> 00:25:02,000
not suddenly you know search for

828
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:04,320
absolutely everything do not suddenly uh

829
00:25:04,320 --> 00:25:05,600
raise alarms on every single

830
00:25:05,600 --> 00:25:07,039
vulnerability in every single library do

831
00:25:07,039 --> 00:25:08,159
not suddenly

832
00:25:08,159 --> 00:25:10,240
scan for every single possible code

833
00:25:10,240 --> 00:25:13,279
quality issue and i don't know

834
00:25:13,279 --> 00:25:15,120
brackets on the wrong line issue from

835
00:25:15,120 --> 00:25:17,279
your from your sas tool

836
00:25:17,279 --> 00:25:20,480
you need to take a phased approach um

837
00:25:20,480 --> 00:25:21,760
these tools will put out a lot of

838
00:25:21,760 --> 00:25:24,720
results if you let them and

839
00:25:24,720 --> 00:25:26,240
you know suddenly seeing okay i've now

840
00:25:26,240 --> 00:25:27,520
got these thousand things to look

841
00:25:27,520 --> 00:25:28,960
through or hundred things to look

842
00:25:28,960 --> 00:25:30,320
through is

843
00:25:30,320 --> 00:25:32,400
yes that's that's a big it's gonna cause

844
00:25:32,400 --> 00:25:34,000
a very very bad impression at all it's

845
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:35,360
been caused by a bad feeling from the

846
00:25:35,360 --> 00:25:36,400
tool

847
00:25:36,400 --> 00:25:37,200
um

848
00:25:37,200 --> 00:25:38,559
you need a plan for how we can do this

849
00:25:38,559 --> 00:25:40,000
gradually let's start off with the most

850
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:41,440
important things

851
00:25:41,440 --> 00:25:42,799
let's start off with what we're really

852
00:25:42,799 --> 00:25:44,799
worried about okay we'll fix those we'll

853
00:25:44,799 --> 00:25:45,919
get those dealt with and let's move on

854
00:25:45,919 --> 00:25:47,360
to the next ones

855
00:25:47,360 --> 00:25:49,279
each time more findings will trickle

856
00:25:49,279 --> 00:25:51,679
through and that's fine um

857
00:25:51,679 --> 00:25:53,600
as long as it's on a more graduated

858
00:25:53,600 --> 00:25:54,720
basis

859
00:25:54,720 --> 00:25:56,559
i think it's going to be easier to have

860
00:25:56,559 --> 00:25:58,799
that

861
00:26:01,039 --> 00:26:02,320
how do you know which findings get the

862
00:26:02,320 --> 00:26:04,799
best signal to noise

863
00:26:04,799 --> 00:26:06,960
so

864
00:26:07,200 --> 00:26:08,240
you know which ones are you getting the

865
00:26:08,240 --> 00:26:09,279
best results which ones are you

866
00:26:09,279 --> 00:26:10,480
constantly not going through and saying

867
00:26:10,480 --> 00:26:12,000
okay first positive false positive false

868
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:14,159
position choose some that you know

869
00:26:14,159 --> 00:26:15,600
are real and need to be dealt with and

870
00:26:15,600 --> 00:26:17,760
you see from the initial results you

871
00:26:17,760 --> 00:26:19,679
know these generally come up with real

872
00:26:19,679 --> 00:26:21,039
issues

873
00:26:21,039 --> 00:26:22,559
um

874
00:26:22,559 --> 00:26:24,799
which findings

875
00:26:24,799 --> 00:26:26,159
are highest risk maybe that's based on

876
00:26:26,159 --> 00:26:27,279
the tool maybe that's based on the

877
00:26:27,279 --> 00:26:28,720
application

878
00:26:28,720 --> 00:26:30,559
um

879
00:26:30,559 --> 00:26:32,240
you need to try and find that balance

880
00:26:32,240 --> 00:26:33,760
but again you need to find a way of

881
00:26:33,760 --> 00:26:37,320
phasing that in

882
00:26:38,080 --> 00:26:40,640
so i might take a lot of grief over this

883
00:26:40,640 --> 00:26:42,080
but i would certainly recommend trying

884
00:26:42,080 --> 00:26:46,960
to upgrade early and upgrade often um

885
00:26:47,039 --> 00:26:48,799
if you can upgrade even before waiting

886
00:26:48,799 --> 00:26:49,840
for vulnerability to be in your

887
00:26:49,840 --> 00:26:51,279
libraries and that's even better let's

888
00:26:51,279 --> 00:26:52,559
say look we want to keep these libraries

889
00:26:52,559 --> 00:26:53,600
up to date so that if there is a

890
00:26:53,600 --> 00:26:55,279
vulnerability we maybe we've already

891
00:26:55,279 --> 00:26:56,720
gone past the vulnerable version or

892
00:26:56,720 --> 00:26:59,200
maybe it's very easy for us to upgrade

893
00:26:59,200 --> 00:27:00,880
we certainly don't want to get stuck in

894
00:27:00,880 --> 00:27:02,880
a situation where three major versions

895
00:27:02,880 --> 00:27:04,480
behind and suddenly a massive

896
00:27:04,480 --> 00:27:05,760
vulnerability comes up with something

897
00:27:05,760 --> 00:27:08,080
under pressure

898
00:27:08,080 --> 00:27:09,760
that can be a lot more difficult it can

899
00:27:09,760 --> 00:27:11,200
be more difficult if this is a product

900
00:27:11,200 --> 00:27:12,240
that we're actually deploying to someone

901
00:27:12,240 --> 00:27:13,760
now we have to support maybe three years

902
00:27:13,760 --> 00:27:16,799
worth of this back as well

903
00:27:16,799 --> 00:27:18,240
yeah this is a whole debate this whole

904
00:27:18,240 --> 00:27:20,240
whole sort of discussion itself but you

905
00:27:20,240 --> 00:27:21,360
really must

906
00:27:21,360 --> 00:27:22,799
try and

907
00:27:22,799 --> 00:27:24,240
upgrade wherever possible if you want to

908
00:27:24,240 --> 00:27:25,600
avoid ending up in these situations

909
00:27:25,600 --> 00:27:26,720
where you've got a lot of work to do in

910
00:27:26,720 --> 00:27:28,640
a short period of time in some sort of

911
00:27:28,640 --> 00:27:30,720
security emergency

912
00:27:30,720 --> 00:27:33,520
it's also a lot easier than actually

913
00:27:33,520 --> 00:27:34,799
trying to analyze these vulnerabilities

914
00:27:34,799 --> 00:27:36,159
in depth if you have to say okay we

915
00:27:36,159 --> 00:27:37,520
can't upgrade this now so we now need to

916
00:27:37,520 --> 00:27:38,720
do some sort of risk assessment and

917
00:27:38,720 --> 00:27:39,919
understand

918
00:27:39,919 --> 00:27:41,919
um what's our real risk from this

919
00:27:41,919 --> 00:27:43,039
library

920
00:27:43,039 --> 00:27:44,399
there's a lot to go in there there's a

921
00:27:44,399 --> 00:27:46,880
lot to uh try and understand there and

922
00:27:46,880 --> 00:27:49,200
it's gonna yeah trying to do that on a

923
00:27:49,200 --> 00:27:51,200
wide on a grand scale is gonna be hard

924
00:27:51,200 --> 00:27:53,520
work

925
00:27:54,320 --> 00:27:55,600
in terms of where we start we're gonna

926
00:27:55,600 --> 00:27:57,360
start on easy to fix issues do we want

927
00:27:57,360 --> 00:27:58,640
to uh

928
00:27:58,640 --> 00:28:00,080
start on the harder to fix issues you

929
00:28:00,080 --> 00:28:01,679
know easy fixes give us better numbers

930
00:28:01,679 --> 00:28:03,200
maybe easier but the harder the fix

931
00:28:03,200 --> 00:28:06,559
issues you know maybe they're the more

932
00:28:06,559 --> 00:28:07,840
you know

933
00:28:07,840 --> 00:28:10,159
they have higher impact and potentially

934
00:28:10,159 --> 00:28:12,240
achieve something more significant and

935
00:28:12,240 --> 00:28:13,760
we don't want to wait and wait and wait

936
00:28:13,760 --> 00:28:17,200
until we have to do this in a hurry um

937
00:28:17,200 --> 00:28:19,520
i would say do both

938
00:28:19,520 --> 00:28:21,279
try and blend in a particular period of

939
00:28:21,279 --> 00:28:23,279
time do some easy but also keep moving

940
00:28:23,279 --> 00:28:24,799
on the hard ones as well um you don't

941
00:28:24,799 --> 00:28:26,559
want to just choose one of those you

942
00:28:26,559 --> 00:28:27,679
need to keep those numbers moving you

943
00:28:27,679 --> 00:28:29,679
need to keep you know getting through

944
00:28:29,679 --> 00:28:32,240
the easy ones you do need to start and

945
00:28:32,240 --> 00:28:33,520
make progress on the hard ones as well

946
00:28:33,520 --> 00:28:34,799
so they don't get left to the end and

947
00:28:34,799 --> 00:28:35,840
suddenly

948
00:28:35,840 --> 00:28:37,520
you're in a massive rush to fix them

949
00:28:37,520 --> 00:28:40,960
with some new vulnerability comes out

950
00:28:43,200 --> 00:28:44,480
think about how to remediate things

951
00:28:44,480 --> 00:28:46,240
strategically we don't just want to fix

952
00:28:46,240 --> 00:28:49,360
one line of code in one place and then

953
00:28:49,360 --> 00:28:50,720
next time the finder comes up we'll do

954
00:28:50,720 --> 00:28:52,880
it again

955
00:28:52,880 --> 00:28:54,240
let's think how we can do this at a

956
00:28:54,240 --> 00:28:55,840
wider basis you know classic example

957
00:28:55,840 --> 00:28:56,960
this is trying to centralize some

958
00:28:56,960 --> 00:28:58,640
functionality i had a client where they

959
00:28:58,640 --> 00:29:01,039
had 150 different issues about log

960
00:29:01,039 --> 00:29:03,120
injection in their sas tool because

961
00:29:03,120 --> 00:29:04,640
every time they did logging they got a

962
00:29:04,640 --> 00:29:05,520
vulnerability about this and they

963
00:29:05,520 --> 00:29:06,720
thought they cheated they thought okay

964
00:29:06,720 --> 00:29:08,399
we'll put all our logging

965
00:29:08,399 --> 00:29:10,960
into one function and we'll create a

966
00:29:10,960 --> 00:29:12,640
wrapper function and then

967
00:29:12,640 --> 00:29:13,679
you know the scan doesn't know about

968
00:29:13,679 --> 00:29:14,880
this raffle function just knows our

969
00:29:14,880 --> 00:29:17,120
logging function so we've changed 150

970
00:29:17,120 --> 00:29:18,399
vulnerabilities into one vulnerability

971
00:29:18,399 --> 00:29:19,919
in one place and i said that's great

972
00:29:19,919 --> 00:29:20,799
that's exactly what you're supposed to

973
00:29:20,799 --> 00:29:23,120
do because now you can do your

974
00:29:23,120 --> 00:29:24,720
standardization for log injection in one

975
00:29:24,720 --> 00:29:26,960
place and just always use that from that

976
00:29:26,960 --> 00:29:28,799
uh wrapper function and then you know

977
00:29:28,799 --> 00:29:30,159
that it's going through the wrapper

978
00:29:30,159 --> 00:29:32,559
function it's being sanitized and you

979
00:29:32,559 --> 00:29:34,880
don't need to worry about it

980
00:29:34,880 --> 00:29:36,159
any way you can do that is gonna make it

981
00:29:36,159 --> 00:29:38,080
easier to centralize and manage your

982
00:29:38,080 --> 00:29:41,080
controls

983
00:29:42,240 --> 00:29:44,799
alternatively if you can say well look

984
00:29:44,799 --> 00:29:46,159
we've got a

985
00:29:46,159 --> 00:29:47,600
some functionality that works in less

986
00:29:47,600 --> 00:29:49,440
secure way we can just swap that out for

987
00:29:49,440 --> 00:29:50,640
newer functionality that works more

988
00:29:50,640 --> 00:29:53,200
securely

989
00:29:53,440 --> 00:29:55,440
it may be a lot of work but it may be

990
00:29:55,440 --> 00:29:56,159
that

991
00:29:56,159 --> 00:29:57,440
overall it makes it a lot easier to

992
00:29:57,440 --> 00:29:59,360
secure the application a lot easier to

993
00:29:59,360 --> 00:30:00,240
uh

994
00:30:00,240 --> 00:30:01,919
avoid shooting yourself in the foot with

995
00:30:01,919 --> 00:30:03,760
something a classic example could be

996
00:30:03,760 --> 00:30:05,760
instead of dealing with secrets locally

997
00:30:05,760 --> 00:30:07,200
have some sort of dedicated secrets

998
00:30:07,200 --> 00:30:09,039
management service that handles that for

999
00:30:09,039 --> 00:30:11,200
you handle the encryption operations key

1000
00:30:11,200 --> 00:30:12,399
management

1001
00:30:12,399 --> 00:30:13,760
suddenly you've taken a lot of things

1002
00:30:13,760 --> 00:30:15,600
that you could potentially get wrong and

1003
00:30:15,600 --> 00:30:18,639
move them somewhere else

1004
00:30:19,760 --> 00:30:21,360
but how do we make sure that happens in

1005
00:30:21,360 --> 00:30:23,600
the future as well

1006
00:30:23,600 --> 00:30:25,200
you need a safety net

1007
00:30:25,200 --> 00:30:26,480
you need something that's going to make

1008
00:30:26,480 --> 00:30:27,679
sure that

1009
00:30:27,679 --> 00:30:28,960
you know the wrapper functions are being

1010
00:30:28,960 --> 00:30:30,480
used the external functionality being

1011
00:30:30,480 --> 00:30:32,640
used and if someone

1012
00:30:32,640 --> 00:30:34,159
tries to use the original function or

1013
00:30:34,159 --> 00:30:35,840
tries to use the unintended

1014
00:30:35,840 --> 00:30:37,840
functionality then it's popping up alert

1015
00:30:37,840 --> 00:30:38,799
saying

1016
00:30:38,799 --> 00:30:39,919
you might want to check this out they're

1017
00:30:39,919 --> 00:30:41,360
not using what we're expecting to be

1018
00:30:41,360 --> 00:30:43,200
using

1019
00:30:43,200 --> 00:30:45,279
yeah this is uh the idea here is to make

1020
00:30:45,279 --> 00:30:47,039
these things easier you know wrapper

1021
00:30:47,039 --> 00:30:48,720
functions externalizing the

1022
00:30:48,720 --> 00:30:50,960
functionality to a dedicated service

1023
00:30:50,960 --> 00:30:52,960
yeah we can we've centralized our

1024
00:30:52,960 --> 00:30:54,320
security risk we've centralized the

1025
00:30:54,320 --> 00:30:55,760
controls

1026
00:30:55,760 --> 00:30:57,039
easier to manage but we just need to

1027
00:30:57,039 --> 00:30:58,640
make sure that's being used on an

1028
00:30:58,640 --> 00:31:01,360
ongoing basis

1029
00:31:02,320 --> 00:31:03,600
so

1030
00:31:03,600 --> 00:31:04,880
that was

1031
00:31:04,880 --> 00:31:06,720
quite a fast tour i hope all those

1032
00:31:06,720 --> 00:31:08,960
issues were useful um i hope those ideas

1033
00:31:08,960 --> 00:31:10,000
are useful

1034
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:12,080
like i say not everyone might be

1035
00:31:12,080 --> 00:31:15,760
relevant for every single person but uh

1036
00:31:15,760 --> 00:31:17,840
yeah i hope that you can use these ideas

1037
00:31:17,840 --> 00:31:19,840
to try and improve the processes and

1038
00:31:19,840 --> 00:31:21,360
just make it easier for yourselves and

1039
00:31:21,360 --> 00:31:23,039
make it easier for developers and

1040
00:31:23,039 --> 00:31:24,559
generally get a better

1041
00:31:24,559 --> 00:31:27,360
better experience from these tools so uh

1042
00:31:27,360 --> 00:31:29,279
yeah thank you very much for listening

1043
00:31:29,279 --> 00:31:31,039
and let me know if you have any

1044
00:31:31,039 --> 00:31:33,840
questions

1045
00:31:34,080 --> 00:31:35,840
thanks josh that was great oh we have

1046
00:31:35,840 --> 00:31:38,240
got a couple questions for you in fact

1047
00:31:38,240 --> 00:31:42,399
so uh firstly from juan was if you only

1048
00:31:42,399 --> 00:31:45,360
have budget and time to do one thing

1049
00:31:45,360 --> 00:31:47,840
what would it be

1050
00:31:48,399 --> 00:31:50,799
um

1051
00:31:50,799 --> 00:31:53,840
company away dana seychelles no

1052
00:31:53,840 --> 00:31:55,600
um

1053
00:31:55,600 --> 00:31:57,760
so

1054
00:31:58,720 --> 00:32:01,279
as in one year one one type of tool i

1055
00:32:01,279 --> 00:32:03,120
guess that's what the meaning is

1056
00:32:03,120 --> 00:32:07,600
you do sca or sas or whatever that's it

1057
00:32:12,720 --> 00:32:14,480
i think there are different risks here i

1058
00:32:14,480 --> 00:32:16,080
think that

1059
00:32:16,080 --> 00:32:17,440
you know you can

1060
00:32:17,440 --> 00:32:19,200
go all in on a particular tool and you

1061
00:32:19,200 --> 00:32:21,039
can spend a lot of money with a vendor

1062
00:32:21,039 --> 00:32:22,320
and you can

1063
00:32:22,320 --> 00:32:23,840
um

1064
00:32:23,840 --> 00:32:25,279
you can spend you can get something very

1065
00:32:25,279 --> 00:32:26,640
sophisticated and start building space

1066
00:32:26,640 --> 00:32:28,880
to get processes but

1067
00:32:28,880 --> 00:32:31,279
you know i i think that

1068
00:32:31,279 --> 00:32:33,440
if you go all in on one then there are

1069
00:32:33,440 --> 00:32:35,279
other possible risks you're not covering

1070
00:32:35,279 --> 00:32:36,159
um

1071
00:32:36,159 --> 00:32:37,919
i don't think it's i think it's an easy

1072
00:32:37,919 --> 00:32:39,279
sort of trade-off to say you should do

1073
00:32:39,279 --> 00:32:41,279
this and then you should do that

1074
00:32:41,279 --> 00:32:43,039
i think you you're exposed to risks

1075
00:32:43,039 --> 00:32:44,880
either way if you're if you're that

1076
00:32:44,880 --> 00:32:46,240
limited on time and budget maybe you

1077
00:32:46,240 --> 00:32:47,600
need to start off with something simple

1078
00:32:47,600 --> 00:32:48,559
for both

1079
00:32:48,559 --> 00:32:49,919
and

1080
00:32:49,919 --> 00:32:52,880
so progress gradually um i think that

1081
00:32:52,880 --> 00:32:54,000
just saying we're going to do this and

1082
00:32:54,000 --> 00:32:57,919
not do that i i'm not sure that's a

1083
00:32:57,919 --> 00:32:59,360
decision you can necessarily make you

1084
00:32:59,360 --> 00:33:00,880
know certainly for

1085
00:33:00,880 --> 00:33:01,270
um

1086
00:33:01,270 --> 00:33:02,559
[Music]

1087
00:33:02,559 --> 00:33:04,480
you know for all of these tools there

1088
00:33:04,480 --> 00:33:05,200
are

1089
00:33:05,200 --> 00:33:06,559
freeware versions that might not be

1090
00:33:06,559 --> 00:33:08,880
super pretty for developers but

1091
00:33:08,880 --> 00:33:11,519
um we'll give you some sort of position

1092
00:33:11,519 --> 00:33:13,039
you know without starting paying paying

1093
00:33:13,039 --> 00:33:14,320
license fee

1094
00:33:14,320 --> 00:33:15,440
i think the important thing is to have

1095
00:33:15,440 --> 00:33:17,279
some sort of perspective and some sort

1096
00:33:17,279 --> 00:33:18,559
of control

1097
00:33:18,559 --> 00:33:20,159
around all of these even if it's

1098
00:33:20,159 --> 00:33:21,440
relatively rudimentary i think you're

1099
00:33:21,440 --> 00:33:22,880
going to struggle to say no i will start

1100
00:33:22,880 --> 00:33:24,799
here and then you know we'll just ignore

1101
00:33:24,799 --> 00:33:26,559
this area completely

1102
00:33:26,559 --> 00:33:28,320
yeah um

1103
00:33:28,320 --> 00:33:30,000
yeah it's a it's a tricky one but i

1104
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:31,600
think you can't necessarily just rule

1105
00:33:31,600 --> 00:33:32,480
out

1106
00:33:32,480 --> 00:33:34,320
particular issues or be a particular

1107
00:33:34,320 --> 00:33:37,039
type of uh issue because you know it can

1108
00:33:37,039 --> 00:33:39,120
all of it can cause you risk

1109
00:33:39,120 --> 00:33:41,519
and then one last question from uh

1110
00:33:41,519 --> 00:33:44,000
from i think we're both clicking about

1111
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:45,600
jamie

1112
00:33:45,600 --> 00:33:48,080
johnson if security isn't a priority

1113
00:33:48,080 --> 00:33:50,640
assuming it means in your organization

1114
00:33:50,640 --> 00:33:51,760
what advice

1115
00:33:51,760 --> 00:33:53,200
to approach management to get more

1116
00:33:53,200 --> 00:33:56,320
support on security

1117
00:33:57,600 --> 00:33:59,840
um

1118
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:01,600
i think

1119
00:34:01,600 --> 00:34:03,519
yeah we have to try and demonstrate what

1120
00:34:03,519 --> 00:34:05,039
is our risk here what is our exposure

1121
00:34:05,039 --> 00:34:07,039
what what could go wrong

1122
00:34:07,039 --> 00:34:08,879
um

1123
00:34:08,879 --> 00:34:11,040
you know this

1124
00:34:11,040 --> 00:34:12,560
isn't necessarily a this isn't this

1125
00:34:12,560 --> 00:34:14,320
isn't a threat modelling talk but a lot

1126
00:34:14,320 --> 00:34:16,079
of it comes down to

1127
00:34:16,079 --> 00:34:18,079
maybe even sitting people down saying

1128
00:34:18,079 --> 00:34:19,280
all right

1129
00:34:19,280 --> 00:34:21,119
what could happen here that would make

1130
00:34:21,119 --> 00:34:23,040
us you know really sad yeah what could

1131
00:34:23,040 --> 00:34:24,719
have happened that would completely ruin

1132
00:34:24,719 --> 00:34:26,560
our day you know yeah maybe on a scale

1133
00:34:26,560 --> 00:34:28,719
of you know what would give us a bad day

1134
00:34:28,719 --> 00:34:30,560
what would give us a bad week what would

1135
00:34:30,560 --> 00:34:32,960
cause us like significant monetary harm

1136
00:34:32,960 --> 00:34:34,560
what would end the company

1137
00:34:34,560 --> 00:34:38,079
every organization has risks that affect

1138
00:34:38,079 --> 00:34:40,000
it and that are going to you know is

1139
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:42,320
going to have to consider

1140
00:34:42,320 --> 00:34:44,399
odds are if they have some reliance on

1141
00:34:44,399 --> 00:34:46,480
software then you know software security

1142
00:34:46,480 --> 00:34:48,879
is going to fit in there somewhere and i

1143
00:34:48,879 --> 00:34:50,960
think that hopefully by demonstrating

1144
00:34:50,960 --> 00:34:52,560
the link between what is going to make

1145
00:34:52,560 --> 00:34:53,839
us really sad what is going to end this

1146
00:34:53,839 --> 00:34:54,960
company

1147
00:34:54,960 --> 00:34:57,440
and bring that link back down to

1148
00:34:57,440 --> 00:34:59,040
well you know what our practices they

1149
00:34:59,040 --> 00:35:00,320
how could that happen based on our

1150
00:35:00,320 --> 00:35:02,240
current practices or how could that

1151
00:35:02,240 --> 00:35:05,839
happen um without doing x y and z

1152
00:35:05,839 --> 00:35:06,960
then

1153
00:35:06,960 --> 00:35:08,720
you know hopefully it that becomes an

1154
00:35:08,720 --> 00:35:09,839
easier conversation because you're

1155
00:35:09,839 --> 00:35:12,160
directly linking it to what a management

1156
00:35:12,160 --> 00:35:13,119
worried about from the business

1157
00:35:13,119 --> 00:35:14,839
perspective

1158
00:35:14,839 --> 00:35:16,800
um

1159
00:35:16,800 --> 00:35:18,640
i look maybe you have to start small you

1160
00:35:18,640 --> 00:35:19,839
have to prioritize you have to say well

1161
00:35:19,839 --> 00:35:21,520
we're just going to focus on this

1162
00:35:21,520 --> 00:35:24,000
particular application which has um you

1163
00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:25,119
know which management particularly

1164
00:35:25,119 --> 00:35:26,079
concerned about we're just going to

1165
00:35:26,079 --> 00:35:28,839
focus on this particular type of issue

1166
00:35:28,839 --> 00:35:30,800
um but

1167
00:35:30,800 --> 00:35:32,720
i think the key thing is to link you

1168
00:35:32,720 --> 00:35:34,640
what is going to make management have a

1169

00:37:29,200 --> 00:37:32,400
the americas time zone obviously uh

1221
00:37:32,400 --> 00:37:34,960
has changed since i was there

1222
00:37:34,960 --> 00:37:36,800
um but uh that'll be great uh there's

1223
00:37:36,800 --> 00:37:38,960

00:37:50,079 --> 00:37:52,079
hands up and writing talks and coming to

1229
00:37:52,079 --> 00:37:53,920
talk at these things obviously

1230
00:37:53,920 --> 00:37:56,160
conferences would be fairly boring as we

1231
00:37:56,160 --> 00:37:57,920

1232

talking nonsense to each other

1233

um

1234
00:38:01,359 --> 00:38:05,920
