[Music]

2
00:00:04,480 --> 00:00:07,120
i think next we have a lightning talk

3
00:00:07,120 --> 00:00:09,760
from um joseph hadouri

4
00:00:09,760 --> 00:00:10,800
um

5
00:00:10,800 --> 00:00:12,559
but before that i did want to obviously

6
00:00:12,559 --> 00:00:14,880
like call out as well i think a lot of

7
00:00:14,880 --> 00:00:17,760
the proceeds that come from devsecond do

8
00:00:17,760 --> 00:00:20,720
go towards um charitable trust um

9
00:00:20,720 --> 00:00:22,160
looking at inclusiveness within

10
00:00:22,160 --> 00:00:23,680
technology and i know and then you're

11
00:00:23,680 --> 00:00:25,279
really passionate about that so i just

12
00:00:25,279 --> 00:00:26,880
wanted to take a moment just to

13
00:00:26,880 --> 00:00:28,800
appreciate that that whilst this is

14
00:00:28,800 --> 00:00:30,560
amazing for knowledge sharing there is

15
00:00:30,560 --> 00:00:32,159
uh you know another really good reason

16
00:00:32,159 --> 00:00:35,360
behind all of this as well

17
00:00:35,360 --> 00:00:37,680
totally amazing

18
00:00:37,680 --> 00:00:40,480
amazing so we might get joseph on board

19
00:00:40,480 --> 00:00:42,320
just out in regards to the lightning

20
00:00:42,320 --> 00:00:46,079
talk don't trust code from strangers

21
00:00:46,079 --> 00:00:48,480
hi guys

22
00:00:48,480 --> 00:00:50,640
hello we're glad to have you here and

23
00:00:50,640 --> 00:00:51,680
especially

24
00:00:51,680 --> 00:00:53,360
uh the talk that you're gonna have is

25
00:00:53,360 --> 00:00:54,960
like don't trust quote from strangers

26
00:00:54,960 --> 00:00:56,719
that's something which interests all of

27
00:00:56,719 --> 00:00:58,960
us a lot and that's like the need they

28
00:00:58,960 --> 00:01:00,559
are

29
00:01:00,559 --> 00:01:01,680
yeah

30
00:01:01,680 --> 00:01:04,559
so uh i'll press uh can you see my

31
00:01:04,559 --> 00:01:06,000
slides

32
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:07,840
yes we'll just bring it in

33
00:01:07,840 --> 00:01:09,520
all right cool

34
00:01:09,520 --> 00:01:11,600
so i have 15 minutes so i'll try to be

35
00:01:11,600 --> 00:01:12,560
quick

36
00:01:12,560 --> 00:01:14,240
hi everyone my name is joseph i'm

37
00:01:14,240 --> 00:01:16,320
heading the supply chain security

38
00:01:16,320 --> 00:01:18,240
engineering group at check marks joined

39
00:01:18,240 --> 00:01:19,600
last year

40
00:01:19,600 --> 00:01:22,159
uh talking about software supply chain

41
00:01:22,159 --> 00:01:24,479
this is a diagram

42
00:01:24,479 --> 00:01:27,360
very simple to understand i think we all

43
00:01:27,360 --> 00:01:28,479
uh

44
00:01:28,479 --> 00:01:29,360
uh

45
00:01:29,360 --> 00:01:31,360
doing that in some way uh developers are

46
00:01:31,360 --> 00:01:33,520
writing code source control is storing

47
00:01:33,520 --> 00:01:35,600
it we have all kinds of real processes

48
00:01:35,600 --> 00:01:38,320
ci flows collecting dependencies

49
00:01:38,320 --> 00:01:40,240
basically responsible for building up

50
00:01:40,240 --> 00:01:42,479
our source control packaging up into a

51
00:01:42,479 --> 00:01:43,920
build artifact

52
00:01:43,920 --> 00:01:46,479
might be stored somewhere uh and then

53
00:01:46,479 --> 00:01:49,200
eventually being consumed by

54
00:01:49,200 --> 00:01:53,040
a different software or user

55
00:01:53,040 --> 00:01:54,960
looking down at this software supply

56
00:01:54,960 --> 00:01:56,159
chain flow

57
00:01:56,159 --> 00:01:58,240
you can see uh three major threats you

58
00:01:58,240 --> 00:02:00,159
have source threats build threats and

59
00:02:00,159 --> 00:02:02,880
dependency threats this was created by

60
00:02:02,880 --> 00:02:05,759
salsa but not this salsa

61
00:02:05,759 --> 00:02:08,000
uh it's a framework initiated by the

62
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:09,679
linux foundation

63
00:02:09,679 --> 00:02:11,599
uh and now partnered with google

64
00:02:11,599 --> 00:02:14,800
citibank a lot of giant companies uh

65
00:02:14,800 --> 00:02:16,879
basically creating the standard in

66
00:02:16,879 --> 00:02:18,480
software supply chain

67
00:02:18,480 --> 00:02:20,800
i want to focus on this area on the

68
00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:22,560
dependencies because in my personal

69
00:02:22,560 --> 00:02:24,160
opinion this is the wild west this is

70
00:02:24,160 --> 00:02:27,599
what scares me the most uh and

71
00:02:27,599 --> 00:02:29,599
breaking it down and thinking about our

72
00:02:29,599 --> 00:02:31,440
dependencies

73
00:02:31,440 --> 00:02:33,440
everybody is using open source i mean

74
00:02:33,440 --> 00:02:35,360
it's very great i myself love to

75
00:02:35,360 --> 00:02:36,879
contribute into the open source and

76
00:02:36,879 --> 00:02:38,959
consume

77
00:02:38,959 --> 00:02:41,440
when we build application ended up you

78
00:02:41,440 --> 00:02:43,360
know compiling our software

79
00:02:43,360 --> 00:02:45,760
uh it's mostly constructed from open

80
00:02:45,760 --> 00:02:47,040
source code

81
00:02:47,040 --> 00:02:50,400
uh it makes sense because all of us

82
00:02:50,400 --> 00:02:51,760
developers

83
00:02:51,760 --> 00:02:54,000
basically wants to deliver fast and be

84
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:55,920
more agile we don't want to reinvent the

85
00:02:55,920 --> 00:02:58,720
wheel i love to say a good developer is

86
00:02:58,720 --> 00:03:00,800
an efficient developer

87
00:03:00,800 --> 00:03:03,440
so this makes out of sense

88
00:03:03,440 --> 00:03:05,599
we are originally asking for specific

89
00:03:05,599 --> 00:03:06,879
dependencies

90
00:03:06,879 --> 00:03:09,519
uh but we need to understand

91
00:03:09,519 --> 00:03:11,599
most of the time we are not asking for

92
00:03:11,599 --> 00:03:14,080
uh the side effects like the transitive

93
00:03:14,080 --> 00:03:15,360
dependencies

94
00:03:15,360 --> 00:03:18,480
uh so uh we can end up with all kinds of

95
00:03:18,480 --> 00:03:20,800
forests uh when we it depends on the

96
00:03:20,800 --> 00:03:22,400
specific packages and then we end up

97
00:03:22,400 --> 00:03:25,360
with a lot of money giving one example

98
00:03:25,360 --> 00:03:28,159
is cnc js this is what happens when you

99
00:03:28,159 --> 00:03:29,840
install it you get

100
00:03:29,840 --> 00:03:32,560
800 over 800 additional packages

101
00:03:32,560 --> 00:03:36,319
contributed form different um over 600

102
00:03:36,319 --> 00:03:38,799
different contributors it's very hard to

103
00:03:38,799 --> 00:03:40,879
go through all of what you got like when

104
00:03:40,879 --> 00:03:43,519
you install a specific dependency

105
00:03:43,519 --> 00:03:46,000
we're just with like a jungle of open

106
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:46,959
source

107
00:03:46,959 --> 00:03:49,840
uh the ecosystem is growing uh

108
00:03:49,840 --> 00:03:51,200
everywhere we see

109
00:03:51,200 --> 00:03:53,280
a lot of more packages being published

110
00:03:53,280 --> 00:03:54,799
into the ecosystem

111
00:03:54,799 --> 00:03:56,879
focusing only on npm

112
00:03:56,879 --> 00:03:59,680
uh we can see as of today we have over

113
00:03:59,680 --> 00:04:02,799
500 000 packages released

114
00:04:02,799 --> 00:04:04,799
every month

115
00:04:04,799 --> 00:04:07,439
and we'll have to trust open source

116
00:04:07,439 --> 00:04:09,519
uh and the reason we do that is we get

117
00:04:09,519 --> 00:04:11,760
the feeling that it's open for everyone

118
00:04:11,760 --> 00:04:13,200
to take a look at it

119
00:04:13,200 --> 00:04:15,120
if there's an issue some

120
00:04:15,120 --> 00:04:17,519
magical character will notice

121
00:04:17,519 --> 00:04:18,798
and there are a lot of scoring

122
00:04:18,798 --> 00:04:20,000
mechanisms

123
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:22,960
like stars and forks

124
00:04:22,960 --> 00:04:25,520
to rate and measure popularity of some

125
00:04:25,520 --> 00:04:27,360
of the projects

126
00:04:27,360 --> 00:04:29,840
what i want to talk about now is like

127
00:04:29,840 --> 00:04:32,400
when we assess and i would start to

128
00:04:32,400 --> 00:04:34,320
choose the popular packages to choose

129
00:04:34,320 --> 00:04:36,400
the popular open source projects to be

130
00:04:36,400 --> 00:04:38,720
on the safe side uh and i want to give a

131
00:04:38,720 --> 00:04:41,360
couple of examples when some of these

132
00:04:41,360 --> 00:04:44,400
popular packages went rogue and gone bad

133
00:04:44,400 --> 00:04:47,199
eventually caused a lot of victims to be

134
00:04:47,199 --> 00:04:49,040
under attack

135
00:04:49,040 --> 00:04:51,280
meet faisal a very cool guy from

136
00:04:51,280 --> 00:04:53,840
indonesia uh he loves contributing the

137
00:04:53,840 --> 00:04:55,199
open source

138
00:04:55,199 --> 00:04:57,280
one of these cool projects called ua

139
00:04:57,280 --> 00:04:58,800
parser js

140
00:04:58,800 --> 00:05:01,520
which is a small library

141
00:05:01,520 --> 00:05:03,360
published to npm to

142
00:05:03,360 --> 00:05:06,639
help parsing the user edged strings very

143
00:05:06,639 --> 00:05:09,120
compact minimized

144
00:05:09,120 --> 00:05:12,000
maintained a lot of years over 10 years

145
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:14,720
and having more than 10 million weekly

146
00:05:14,720 --> 00:05:17,600
downloads a very popular packages it is

147
00:05:17,600 --> 00:05:20,639
used by many organizations even facebook

148
00:05:20,639 --> 00:05:22,960
and you know what most likely you're

149
00:05:22,960 --> 00:05:25,280
already using it if not directly

150
00:05:25,280 --> 00:05:28,320
transitively via one of your

151
00:05:28,320 --> 00:05:30,560
existing dependencies

152
00:05:30,560 --> 00:05:34,880
let's go back uh october 5th 2021

153
00:05:34,880 --> 00:05:36,960
not so far ago from now

154
00:05:36,960 --> 00:05:39,120
on the russian underground

155
00:05:39,120 --> 00:05:40,240
hackers

156
00:05:40,240 --> 00:05:42,080
posted this message

157
00:05:42,080 --> 00:05:45,199
i'm selling an account on npmjs having

158
00:05:45,199 --> 00:05:47,600
more than seven million weekly downloads

159
00:05:47,600 --> 00:05:49,759
there is no two-factor authentication

160
00:05:49,759 --> 00:05:51,600
enabled on this account

161
00:05:51,600 --> 00:05:54,400
it's suitable for all kinds of things

162
00:05:54,400 --> 00:05:56,720
miners creating the botnet

163
00:05:56,720 --> 00:05:59,120
bidding starts 10k

164
00:05:59,120 --> 00:06:01,919
sounds interesting

165
00:06:02,080 --> 00:06:04,639
what happens couple of weeks later is

166
00:06:04,639 --> 00:06:07,120
faisal posted this message

167
00:06:07,120 --> 00:06:08,720
on his own project

168
00:06:08,720 --> 00:06:10,319
he was saying that he's sorry and

169
00:06:10,319 --> 00:06:12,800
someone was hijacking his npm account

170
00:06:12,800 --> 00:06:14,880
publishing a couple of versions

171
00:06:14,880 --> 00:06:16,400
containing malware

172
00:06:16,400 --> 00:06:19,360
sadly what the attacker did we know that

173
00:06:19,360 --> 00:06:21,520
someone was buying this publication on

174
00:06:21,520 --> 00:06:23,120
the russian underground

175
00:06:23,120 --> 00:06:25,840
uh and published simultaneously free

176
00:06:25,840 --> 00:06:27,440
version containing the same malicious

177
00:06:27,440 --> 00:06:28,800
code

178
00:06:28,800 --> 00:06:31,199
uh this was the the attackers preserved

179
00:06:31,199 --> 00:06:33,360
the original functionality to not

180
00:06:33,360 --> 00:06:36,400
causing any uh functionality damage

181
00:06:36,400 --> 00:06:38,000
but to add

182
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:39,520
uh

183
00:06:39,520 --> 00:06:41,280
trying to do that silently to add a

184
00:06:41,280 --> 00:06:43,680
crypto miner and a credential stealer to

185
00:06:43,680 --> 00:06:47,199
all many victims using these packages

186
00:06:47,199 --> 00:06:48,880
two weeks later

187
00:06:48,880 --> 00:06:50,960
uh additional two packages popular

188
00:06:50,960 --> 00:06:53,599
packages were compromised uh in this

189
00:06:53,599 --> 00:06:56,080
case it was cora and rc command line

190
00:06:56,080 --> 00:06:58,479
parser and configuration manager

191
00:06:58,479 --> 00:07:02,960
combined having over 22 weekly downloads

192
00:07:02,960 --> 00:07:05,120
same malicious code looking out at the

193
00:07:05,120 --> 00:07:07,280
timeline we see the activity of this

194
00:07:07,280 --> 00:07:09,520
attack group

195
00:07:09,520 --> 00:07:10,319
and

196
00:07:10,319 --> 00:07:13,599
it's a very sad case we see a lot of

197
00:07:13,599 --> 00:07:15,759
innocent users relying on popular

198
00:07:15,759 --> 00:07:19,039
packages getting these bad malwares

199
00:07:19,039 --> 00:07:20,800
another example

200
00:07:20,800 --> 00:07:24,319
is a developer uh lives in california

201
00:07:24,319 --> 00:07:25,840
goes under the name brandon zuckee

202
00:07:25,840 --> 00:07:26,960
miller

203
00:07:26,960 --> 00:07:29,520
he's a very cool guy riding motorcycles

204
00:07:29,520 --> 00:07:31,440
electric motorcycles taking them to the

205
00:07:31,440 --> 00:07:34,240
track has a youtube channel um he's

206
00:07:34,240 --> 00:07:35,759
making a youtube

207
00:07:35,759 --> 00:07:38,479
a positive impact he contributes a lot a

208
00:07:38,479 --> 00:07:41,199
lot of packages having over 40 packages

209
00:07:41,199 --> 00:07:42,960
on npm

210
00:07:42,960 --> 00:07:45,520
one of them is node ipc

211
00:07:45,520 --> 00:07:48,160
uh used for inter-process communication

212
00:07:48,160 --> 00:07:51,199
uh a very popular project having over a

213
00:07:51,199 --> 00:07:53,599
million weekly downloads maintained for

214
00:07:53,599 --> 00:07:54,960
many years

215
00:07:54,960 --> 00:07:57,280
and a couple of months from now not so

216
00:07:57,280 --> 00:08:00,319
far ago on march 7 2022

217
00:08:00,319 --> 00:08:02,000
brandon himself added a new

218
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:05,199
functionality to his own project uh this

219
00:08:05,199 --> 00:08:05,840
is

220
00:08:05,840 --> 00:08:09,599
the commit and this is what he added

221
00:08:09,599 --> 00:08:11,120
one line of code

222
00:08:11,120 --> 00:08:13,840
uh breaking it down and purifying what

223
00:08:13,840 --> 00:08:17,680
we see here is this code uh very short

224
00:08:17,680 --> 00:08:18,560
code

225
00:08:18,560 --> 00:08:19,840
uh

226
00:08:19,840 --> 00:08:21,599
basically what the code is doing is

227
00:08:21,599 --> 00:08:24,000
going into making an http request into

228
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:26,800
ipgo location a service

229
00:08:26,800 --> 00:08:28,639
resulting with

230
00:08:28,639 --> 00:08:30,240
the country name and what kind of

231
00:08:30,240 --> 00:08:32,080
information where the request was came

232
00:08:32,080 --> 00:08:33,200
from

233
00:08:33,200 --> 00:08:35,279
and then brandon checks

234
00:08:35,279 --> 00:08:38,719
if the country of the victims is coming

235
00:08:38,719 --> 00:08:40,958
from russia or belarus

236
00:08:40,958 --> 00:08:42,000
then

237
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:44,080
let's wipe down his files on this

238
00:08:44,080 --> 00:08:46,080
computer

239
00:08:46,080 --> 00:08:46,959
uh

240
00:08:46,959 --> 00:08:50,959
basically sending uh a malware to russia

241
00:08:50,959 --> 00:08:54,080
is go he calls it a heart attack malware

242
00:08:54,080 --> 00:08:56,399
clears the content of existing files

243
00:08:56,399 --> 00:08:58,720
from whatever was stored in to heart

244
00:08:58,720 --> 00:09:01,600
emoji this is his delete logic

245
00:09:01,600 --> 00:09:03,279
you might be wondering yourself why

246
00:09:03,279 --> 00:09:05,279
would brandon like you know he builds up

247
00:09:05,279 --> 00:09:06,959
a name for many years to contribute to a

248
00:09:06,959 --> 00:09:09,200
lot of projects why would brandon flip

249
00:09:09,200 --> 00:09:11,519
and do such a thing

250
00:09:11,519 --> 00:09:14,720
this was his way to protest against the

251
00:09:14,720 --> 00:09:16,959
russia ukraine war

252
00:09:16,959 --> 00:09:19,519
he was not willing to sit down and do

253
00:09:19,519 --> 00:09:20,880
nothing

254
00:09:20,880 --> 00:09:23,920
and took a step into side you know in

255
00:09:23,920 --> 00:09:26,399
like targeting russian uh

256
00:09:26,399 --> 00:09:29,200
developers victims and wiping them their

257
00:09:29,200 --> 00:09:30,240
computer

258
00:09:30,240 --> 00:09:32,240
he was saying on social media you

259
00:09:32,240 --> 00:09:34,080
download my software so i'm allowed to

260
00:09:34,080 --> 00:09:36,560
wipe down your computer and this it was

261
00:09:36,560 --> 00:09:38,640
the first time we saw the term quarter

262
00:09:38,640 --> 00:09:39,600
square

263
00:09:39,600 --> 00:09:41,279
uh in news

264
00:09:41,279 --> 00:09:43,279
some of the cool i don't know cool but

265
00:09:43,279 --> 00:09:45,680
some of the interesting comments were uh

266
00:09:45,680 --> 00:09:47,360
posted on these

267
00:09:47,360 --> 00:09:48,839
variant social

268
00:09:48,839 --> 00:09:52,240
medias uh brandon that's abuse of power

269
00:09:52,240 --> 00:09:54,720
don't become what you hate

270
00:09:54,720 --> 00:09:56,240
thank you for teaching me not to take

271
00:09:56,240 --> 00:09:58,320
handouts and code everything myself or

272
00:09:58,320 --> 00:10:00,320
do i try

273
00:10:00,320 --> 00:10:01,360
uh

274
00:10:01,360 --> 00:10:03,040
this one is hilarious

275
00:10:03,040 --> 00:10:05,600
that's this takes let's go bear them to

276
00:10:05,600 --> 00:10:08,160
a whole other level

277
00:10:08,160 --> 00:10:09,519
and this was

278
00:10:09,519 --> 00:10:11,200
causing us to think

279
00:10:11,200 --> 00:10:12,720
you know bernie has a lot of other

280
00:10:12,720 --> 00:10:15,519
projects what about them he still have

281
00:10:15,519 --> 00:10:17,120
access

282
00:10:17,120 --> 00:10:19,040
even though even to know the ipc still

283
00:10:19,040 --> 00:10:21,279
have access to his other projects

284
00:10:21,279 --> 00:10:24,079
um and you know a good reputation is

285
00:10:24,079 --> 00:10:26,079
something that is very hard to build but

286
00:10:26,079 --> 00:10:28,560
you can lose that in a snap so brandon

287
00:10:28,560 --> 00:10:32,240
lost his reputation in this case

288
00:10:32,240 --> 00:10:33,279
and

289
00:10:33,279 --> 00:10:34,240
a lot of

290
00:10:34,240 --> 00:10:36,800
other examples where popular projects

291
00:10:36,800 --> 00:10:40,240
used by many users were gone bad is this

292
00:10:40,240 --> 00:10:42,000
list but what i want to show you right

293
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:43,200
now is

294
00:10:43,200 --> 00:10:45,440
how easy it is to publish a malicious

295
00:10:45,440 --> 00:10:46,720
package

296
00:10:46,720 --> 00:10:49,120
this is called package lab it's a tool

297
00:10:49,120 --> 00:10:52,320
created internally by our research team

298
00:10:52,320 --> 00:10:54,720
um and what i'm going to do here is i'm

299
00:10:54,720 --> 00:10:56,079
going to use

300
00:10:56,079 --> 00:10:58,560
uh an already created identity on python

301
00:10:58,560 --> 00:11:00,880
python package index to publish a

302
00:11:00,880 --> 00:11:02,640
malicious package over there and show

303
00:11:02,640 --> 00:11:04,240
you how easy it is

304
00:11:04,240 --> 00:11:06,480
in order to do so we need to choose a

305
00:11:06,480 --> 00:11:08,720
name for our package so i'll go with

306
00:11:08,720 --> 00:11:10,560
supply chain demo

307
00:11:10,560 --> 00:11:12,959
and then choosing a version

308
00:11:12,959 --> 00:11:16,800
i'll go with 1.2.3

309
00:11:16,800 --> 00:11:18,800
this is optionally but

310
00:11:18,800 --> 00:11:20,720
you can see in the next slide why it's

311
00:11:20,720 --> 00:11:23,440
important we can select and state what

312
00:11:23,440 --> 00:11:24,399
is the

313
00:11:24,399 --> 00:11:26,079
source project

314
00:11:26,079 --> 00:11:28,560
on github where this package is related

315
00:11:28,560 --> 00:11:29,600
from

316
00:11:29,600 --> 00:11:33,120
um so let's browse the trending projects

317
00:11:33,120 --> 00:11:35,600
and choose some random projects having a

318
00:11:35,600 --> 00:11:39,519
lot of traction we'll go with this one

319
00:11:39,519 --> 00:11:41,360
and

320
00:11:41,360 --> 00:11:43,200
this one is having

321
00:11:43,200 --> 00:11:45,760
over 9000 stars on github a very

322
00:11:45,760 --> 00:11:48,160
interesting project

323
00:11:48,160 --> 00:11:50,079
so this comes the fun part this is where

324
00:11:50,079 --> 00:11:52,720
we can state our malicious code

325
00:11:52,720 --> 00:11:55,440
uh when we plan this attack this is the

326
00:11:55,440 --> 00:11:57,440
step we were currently at we're going to

327
00:11:57,440 --> 00:11:59,440
publish a malicious package

328
00:11:59,440 --> 00:12:01,440
victim is going to install our malicious

329
00:12:01,440 --> 00:12:03,920
package and then we're going to go into

330
00:12:03,920 --> 00:12:05,839
a service called pastebin and we're

331
00:12:05,839 --> 00:12:07,120
going to store

332
00:12:07,120 --> 00:12:09,600
a code is going to be downloaded inside

333
00:12:09,600 --> 00:12:11,760
of our application and then injected

334
00:12:11,760 --> 00:12:13,839
runtime and this is where our malicious

335
00:12:13,839 --> 00:12:15,920
coin is going to play

336
00:12:15,920 --> 00:12:17,120
eventually

337
00:12:17,120 --> 00:12:19,760
sensitive information such as ssh keys

338
00:12:19,760 --> 00:12:21,360
our environment variables are going to

339
00:12:21,360 --> 00:12:24,480
be exfiltrated into a web book service

340
00:12:24,480 --> 00:12:26,480
hosted on interactive sage

341
00:12:26,480 --> 00:12:28,240
and this is two lines of code we're

342
00:12:28,240 --> 00:12:30,480
going to add into our malicious package

343
00:12:30,480 --> 00:12:33,600
an http request into pastebin and then

344
00:12:33,600 --> 00:12:35,279
statement a built-in functionality in

345
00:12:35,279 --> 00:12:37,040
python called exec

346
00:12:37,040 --> 00:12:39,440
so whatever result from this space mean

347
00:12:39,440 --> 00:12:40,639
is going to be injected into our

348
00:12:40,639 --> 00:12:42,480
application

349
00:12:42,480 --> 00:12:43,519
that's it

350
00:12:43,519 --> 00:12:45,680
let's launch it

351
00:12:45,680 --> 00:12:48,079
after a couple of moments we're going to

352
00:12:48,079 --> 00:12:52,599
have our malicious package live

353
00:12:53,440 --> 00:12:55,600
and even though it was published 10

354
00:12:55,600 --> 00:12:56,880
seconds ago

355
00:12:56,880 --> 00:12:58,880
our malicious package is highly popular

356
00:12:58,880 --> 00:13:01,680
it has look it down the statistics it

357
00:13:01,680 --> 00:13:04,480
has over 9000 github stars

358
00:13:04,480 --> 00:13:06,399
this attack technique is called star

359
00:13:06,399 --> 00:13:09,120
jacking we saw that uh in the past year

360
00:13:09,120 --> 00:13:11,600
used by many attackers usually combined

361
00:13:11,600 --> 00:13:13,279
with all kinds of techniques such as

362
00:13:13,279 --> 00:13:14,880
type of squatting

363
00:13:14,880 --> 00:13:15,600
but

364
00:13:15,600 --> 00:13:17,360
look how simple it is to publish a

365
00:13:17,360 --> 00:13:18,959
malicious package

366
00:13:18,959 --> 00:13:20,480
no one checks whatever you provide the

367
00:13:20,480 --> 00:13:22,720
metadata the code uh

368
00:13:22,720 --> 00:13:25,279
very very scary to me

369
00:13:25,279 --> 00:13:27,200
from attacker points of view whenever

370
00:13:27,200 --> 00:13:29,440
victims installs our malicious package

371
00:13:29,440 --> 00:13:31,200
you can have it multiple ways either as

372
00:13:31,200 --> 00:13:32,959
a sub dependency but let's go down with

373
00:13:32,959 --> 00:13:36,320
simply like people installing it right

374
00:13:36,320 --> 00:13:39,199
uh this is what happens you know nothing

375
00:13:39,199 --> 00:13:42,639
very suspicious on the victim side but

376
00:13:42,639 --> 00:13:44,560
from an attacker's point of view you can

377
00:13:44,560 --> 00:13:46,560
see ssh keys

378
00:13:46,560 --> 00:13:48,800
uh environment variables

379
00:13:48,800 --> 00:13:50,240
a lot of sensitive information being

380
00:13:50,240 --> 00:13:51,839
sent

381
00:13:51,839 --> 00:13:54,079
and breaking down the reason why it's

382
00:13:54,079 --> 00:13:56,639
that easy we have no vetting uh accounts

383
00:13:56,639 --> 00:13:58,320
are being taken over as we saw in one of

384
00:13:58,320 --> 00:13:59,600
the examples

385
00:13:59,600 --> 00:14:02,160
uh we have a lot of automatic updates uh

386
00:14:02,160 --> 00:14:03,600
it takes a lot of time to detect such

387
00:14:03,600 --> 00:14:04,639
attacks

388
00:14:04,639 --> 00:14:07,120
we have a lot of moving parts um

389
00:14:07,120 --> 00:14:08,160
and

390
00:14:08,160 --> 00:14:10,720
uh eventually what do we do i want you

391
00:14:10,720 --> 00:14:12,639
to remember what if there is a thing i

392
00:14:12,639 --> 00:14:14,720
want you to remember from this uh short

393
00:14:14,720 --> 00:14:18,000
talk is vulnerable is not malicious okay

394
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:19,600
we can live okay with some

395
00:14:19,600 --> 00:14:21,279
vulnerabilities because they are not

396
00:14:21,279 --> 00:14:24,240
applied on our application but you never

397
00:14:24,240 --> 00:14:26,959
want to have packages or components

398
00:14:26,959 --> 00:14:28,639
containing malicious code

399
00:14:28,639 --> 00:14:30,639
you need to get rid of them as soon as

400
00:14:30,639 --> 00:14:32,160
possible

401
00:14:32,160 --> 00:14:34,000
um the industry needs to share more

402
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:35,279
information

403
00:14:35,279 --> 00:14:37,600
uh we need better standards uh to

404
00:14:37,600 --> 00:14:38,880
catalog

405
00:14:38,880 --> 00:14:40,720
all of these supply chain incidents we

406
00:14:40,720 --> 00:14:43,120
don't have a standard as of today so

407
00:14:43,120 --> 00:14:46,000
each vendor is like creating its own

408
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:49,120
ids so for the uh ue parser incident

409
00:14:49,120 --> 00:14:51,519
this is uh like a couple of examples

410
00:14:51,519 --> 00:14:53,839
where every vendor created its own

411
00:14:53,839 --> 00:14:54,880
ways

412
00:14:54,880 --> 00:14:57,360
um we're in this together we share a lot

413
00:14:57,360 --> 00:14:59,040
of information with all of our

414
00:14:59,040 --> 00:15:00,399
competitors

415
00:15:00,399 --> 00:15:01,760
um

416
00:15:01,760 --> 00:15:03,120
it's our software it's our

417
00:15:03,120 --> 00:15:04,959
responsibility

418
00:15:04,959 --> 00:15:07,279
don't take out from strangers and i'm

419
00:15:07,279 --> 00:15:09,760
inviting you to talk next week at the

420
00:15:09,760 --> 00:15:12,399
open source summit uh where i will have

421
00:15:12,399 --> 00:15:14,639
more time to share more examples more

422
00:15:14,639 --> 00:15:16,320
demos uh

423
00:15:16,320 --> 00:15:17,839
it's called the simple yet free full

424
00:15:17,839 --> 00:15:19,519
anatomy of a software supply chain

425
00:15:19,519 --> 00:15:22,639
attack you're welcome to check it in

426
00:15:22,639 --> 00:15:24,399
thank you guys

427
00:15:24,399 --> 00:15:26,480
thank you so much joseph it was amazing

428
00:15:26,480 --> 00:15:28,000
like a quick and short talk you were

429
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:29,759
talking about and then punches all of

430
00:15:29,759 --> 00:15:32,160
those things they were amazing it was

431
00:15:32,160 --> 00:15:34,160
true truly a lightning talk

432
00:15:34,160 --> 00:15:35,920
i'm looking at the timer and it's 15

433
00:15:35,920 --> 00:15:38,000
minutes so i'm glad

434
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:39,279
you've done well and as you said

435
00:15:39,279 --> 00:15:40,880
vulnerabilities if it's vulnerable it's

436
00:15:40,880 --> 00:15:42,720
not malicious i think that's a great

437
00:15:42,720 --> 00:15:44,160
little takeaway

438
00:15:44,160 --> 00:15:47,600
um from that talk as well

439
00:15:48,480 --> 00:15:50,399
great thank you so much joseph we'll

440
