00:00:00,470 --> 00:00:04,240
[Music]

2
00:00:04,240 --> 00:00:05,920
all right so i think without further ado

3
00:00:05,920 --> 00:00:08,639
let's bring nilu on to start up sessions

4
00:00:08,639 --> 00:00:10,879
there

5
00:00:14,799 --> 00:00:18,000
hey hey nilo let's unmute you

6
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:21,039
hold on a second there

7
00:00:23,359 --> 00:00:25,760
needle feel free to unmute your mic

8
00:00:25,760 --> 00:00:29,320
uh in there

9
00:00:31,679 --> 00:00:32,479
yes

10
00:00:32,479 --> 00:00:33,760
i'm getting a little bit of feedback i

11
00:00:33,760 --> 00:00:34,719
don't know if that's just on my side

12
00:00:34,719 --> 00:00:36,559
eric do you hear that as well yeah i'm

13
00:00:36,559 --> 00:00:39,120
getting a little feedback

14
00:00:39,120 --> 00:00:40,719
um

15
00:00:40,719 --> 00:00:42,399
can you give me no

16
00:00:42,399 --> 00:00:43,760
yeah we hear you but it's a little bit

17
00:00:43,760 --> 00:00:46,160
staticky the mic sounds distorted a bit

18
00:00:46,160 --> 00:00:48,000
for some reason okay just leave me a

19
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:49,039
second

20
00:00:49,039 --> 00:00:50,320
sure

21
00:00:50,320 --> 00:00:53,600
hey neil hi can you hear me now yes

22
00:00:53,600 --> 00:00:56,480
fantastic much better okay great

23
00:00:56,480 --> 00:00:58,559
so let me share my screen

24
00:00:58,559 --> 00:00:59,680
sure

25
00:00:59,680 --> 00:01:01,840
and i think um what was happening there

26
00:01:01,840 --> 00:01:04,479
is your your microphone you know no pun

27
00:01:04,479 --> 00:01:06,479
intended intentionally right there but

28
00:01:06,479 --> 00:01:08,560
uh it was going full throttle right it

29
00:01:08,560 --> 00:01:09,680
was like

30
00:01:09,680 --> 00:01:12,240
overpowered and ready for your next

31
00:01:12,240 --> 00:01:13,439
session that you're going to be speaking

32
00:01:13,439 --> 00:01:14,880
to us about

33
00:01:14,880 --> 00:01:17,119
yeah i think i had to reset a reset it a

34
00:01:17,119 --> 00:01:18,799
little bit but uh can you see the screen

35
00:01:18,799 --> 00:01:20,320
now

36
00:01:20,320 --> 00:01:23,759
yes we have it we're ready to go and uh

37
00:01:23,759 --> 00:01:25,439
if you want to take it away feel free to

38
00:01:25,439 --> 00:01:27,040
go ahead

39
00:01:27,040 --> 00:01:29,600
thanks thanks eric uh thanks a lot uh

40
00:01:29,600 --> 00:01:33,280
for having me here at devsecond so um

41
00:01:33,280 --> 00:01:35,680
it all starts a few years ago actually

42
00:01:35,680 --> 00:01:37,360
and i was just thinking about the the

43
00:01:37,360 --> 00:01:38,960
entire subject that i wanted to talk

44
00:01:38,960 --> 00:01:42,000
about a few years ago when i joined my

45
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:43,920
current organization

46
00:01:43,920 --> 00:01:46,399
those days where the pre pandemic days

47
00:01:46,399 --> 00:01:49,119
when we used to go around meeting people

48
00:01:49,119 --> 00:01:51,840
so i was pretty excited i

49
00:01:51,840 --> 00:01:54,159
went around talking to the tech leads

50
00:01:54,159 --> 00:01:55,680
tech architects

51
00:01:55,680 --> 00:01:58,399
i wanted to meet the heads of tech and

52
00:01:58,399 --> 00:02:00,719
security and you know i was trying to

53
00:02:00,719 --> 00:02:03,200
understand at the time what is their

54
00:02:03,200 --> 00:02:05,439
one main problem statement that they

55
00:02:05,439 --> 00:02:07,200
were trying to solve

56
00:02:07,200 --> 00:02:09,440
and that i could help with

57
00:02:09,440 --> 00:02:12,080
uh and almost unanimously everybody was

58
00:02:12,080 --> 00:02:14,160
talking about just one thing you know

59
00:02:14,160 --> 00:02:16,480
the main ask was to

60
00:02:16,480 --> 00:02:18,560
make security more proactive given that

61
00:02:18,560 --> 00:02:20,959
it was an agile development environment

62
00:02:20,959 --> 00:02:23,599
and they wanted their teams to be unable

63
00:02:23,599 --> 00:02:25,920
to do security on their own

64
00:02:25,920 --> 00:02:29,440
and interestingly uh having been from uh

65
00:02:29,440 --> 00:02:30,800
you know an offensive security

66
00:02:30,800 --> 00:02:32,720
background and having done security the

67
00:02:32,720 --> 00:02:35,440
typical way for a long time many of us

68
00:02:35,440 --> 00:02:38,480
would uh sort of dread the idea of

69
00:02:38,480 --> 00:02:40,640
letting go you know losing that control

70
00:02:40,640 --> 00:02:43,840
that many of us as security teams have

71
00:02:43,840 --> 00:02:46,400
um and that felt a bit out of place for

72
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:47,840
me as well

73
00:02:47,840 --> 00:02:49,840
but i kept that in mind i came back and

74
00:02:49,840 --> 00:02:51,360
i was thinking of you know how do we

75
00:02:51,360 --> 00:02:52,720
tackle this

76
00:02:52,720 --> 00:02:54,879
this particular problem statement that

77
00:02:54,879 --> 00:02:55,920
was given

78
00:02:55,920 --> 00:02:58,080
um and i kept thinking about it while i

79
00:02:58,080 --> 00:02:59,680
was you know into automation and doing

80
00:02:59,680 --> 00:03:02,159
assessments and other things

81
00:03:02,159 --> 00:03:03,599
so um

82
00:03:03,599 --> 00:03:06,400
one day i was just talking to someone

83
00:03:06,400 --> 00:03:08,959
and they just sort of threw this

84
00:03:08,959 --> 00:03:10,720
statement on me while they were talking

85
00:03:10,720 --> 00:03:12,080
and very casually you know they

86
00:03:12,080 --> 00:03:12,959
mentioned

87
00:03:12,959 --> 00:03:15,440
um culture eats started strategy for

88
00:03:15,440 --> 00:03:16,879
breakfast

89
00:03:16,879 --> 00:03:19,360
and this is a famous quote by peter

90
00:03:19,360 --> 00:03:21,680
drucker and um at that time it was new

91
00:03:21,680 --> 00:03:23,920
to me uh and

92
00:03:23,920 --> 00:03:25,680
it just struck me when they said that

93
00:03:25,680 --> 00:03:28,239
and i was thinking about it for quite a

94
00:03:28,239 --> 00:03:30,319
while and when and then i realized uh

95
00:03:30,319 --> 00:03:32,640
how true that is

96
00:03:32,640 --> 00:03:34,720
so essentially here what what he's

97
00:03:34,720 --> 00:03:36,720
trying to say is uh whether you have

98
00:03:36,720 --> 00:03:38,799
strategy and tactics and they have their

99
00:03:38,799 --> 00:03:41,280
own importance if you want to succeed at

100
00:03:41,280 --> 00:03:43,360
an organization scale

101
00:03:43,360 --> 00:03:44,720
culture is something that you need to

102
00:03:44,720 --> 00:03:48,080
focus on so that is what stayed with me

103
00:03:48,080 --> 00:03:50,720
uh but just for us to understand and the

104
00:03:50,720 --> 00:03:52,480
rationale behind what what we are going

105
00:03:52,480 --> 00:03:55,200
to discuss further um i wanted to also

106
00:03:55,200 --> 00:03:57,040
show you this other side you know which

107
00:03:57,040 --> 00:04:00,080
is more logical to the whole thing is in

108
00:04:00,080 --> 00:04:01,760
the past few years we've been seeing

109
00:04:01,760 --> 00:04:04,000
attack trends moving from you know the

110
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:07,200
network uh side to the application side

111
00:04:07,200 --> 00:04:09,360
and now the new attack surface is more

112
00:04:09,360 --> 00:04:11,519
like cloud and it has moved to you know

113
00:04:11,519 --> 00:04:13,599
the supply chain and we are seeing more

114
00:04:13,599 --> 00:04:16,000
and more attacks happening in this area

115
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:18,160
uh it could be because of changing

116
00:04:18,160 --> 00:04:19,440
technology

117
00:04:19,440 --> 00:04:21,199
or newer environments

118
00:04:21,199 --> 00:04:23,840
or even the ease of provisioning systems

119
00:04:23,840 --> 00:04:26,160
and scaling them these days

120
00:04:26,160 --> 00:04:28,560
but whatever be the reason when you when

121
00:04:28,560 --> 00:04:30,320
you look at it a little more deeply for

122
00:04:30,320 --> 00:04:31,919
example if you just pick up the supply

123
00:04:31,919 --> 00:04:33,840
chain attacks that have been um so

124
00:04:33,840 --> 00:04:36,400
prevalent these days you will see that

125
00:04:36,400 --> 00:04:38,080
many or most of these have happened

126
00:04:38,080 --> 00:04:39,520
because of either

127
00:04:39,520 --> 00:04:41,680
for example insecure pipeline components

128
00:04:41,680 --> 00:04:44,000
or insecure product

129
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:46,639
or just unmanaged secrets

130
00:04:46,639 --> 00:04:48,960
and the common denominator in all of

131
00:04:48,960 --> 00:04:51,520
this is that we as development teams

132
00:04:51,520 --> 00:04:53,600
have left something open or

133
00:04:53,600 --> 00:04:57,520
misconfigured or something like that

134
00:04:57,520 --> 00:04:58,880
now

135
00:04:58,880 --> 00:05:00,400
the other thing that i was thinking

136
00:05:00,400 --> 00:05:02,400
about when i was thinking of this is

137
00:05:02,400 --> 00:05:03,600
that

138
00:05:03,600 --> 00:05:05,199
given that there is a lot of change

139
00:05:05,199 --> 00:05:06,960
there are a lot of variables there is

140
00:05:06,960 --> 00:05:09,120
something else that has changed as well

141
00:05:09,120 --> 00:05:10,960
for these kind of attacks to be very

142
00:05:10,960 --> 00:05:13,280
very prevalent now

143
00:05:13,280 --> 00:05:16,080
so and that's when i i thought about uh

144
00:05:16,080 --> 00:05:18,080
agile we have been

145
00:05:18,080 --> 00:05:20,560
working in the waterfall model for quite

146
00:05:20,560 --> 00:05:23,280
a few years long time back and most of

147
00:05:23,280 --> 00:05:25,919
us or many of us have in the last decade

148
00:05:25,919 --> 00:05:28,560
been moving to primarily agile forms of

149
00:05:28,560 --> 00:05:29,759
development

150
00:05:29,759 --> 00:05:32,400
um agile as many of us would know is

151
00:05:32,400 --> 00:05:34,400
hydrated incremental you know it's time

152
00:05:34,400 --> 00:05:37,840
boxed um but one primary thing about

153
00:05:37,840 --> 00:05:40,720
agile development is it is it has it is

154
00:05:40,720 --> 00:05:42,000
very fast paced you know there are

155
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:43,280
faster releases there are faster

156
00:05:43,280 --> 00:05:45,759
deployments happening and the context is

157
00:05:45,759 --> 00:05:49,440
evolving uh very very fast

158
00:05:49,440 --> 00:05:51,759
um what happened in in the this this

159
00:05:51,759 --> 00:05:54,560
last few years was that uh the speed of

160
00:05:54,560 --> 00:05:56,720
development and agile was so fast that

161
00:05:56,720 --> 00:05:58,720
operations had to catch up they had to

162
00:05:58,720 --> 00:06:00,319
automate a lot of things

163
00:06:00,319 --> 00:06:02,240
and i would say it worked wonderfully

164
00:06:02,240 --> 00:06:03,840
for them

165
00:06:03,840 --> 00:06:06,080
but the idea is can we equate that with

166
00:06:06,080 --> 00:06:07,919
security or will it equally work for

167
00:06:07,919 --> 00:06:10,240
security

168
00:06:10,240 --> 00:06:12,160
so when you look at the products which

169
00:06:12,160 --> 00:06:13,440
are available now there are a lot of

170
00:06:13,440 --> 00:06:15,759
products in the market to do

171
00:06:15,759 --> 00:06:17,919
product security of sorts but

172
00:06:17,919 --> 00:06:20,880
um you can in fact do code reviews uh

173
00:06:20,880 --> 00:06:22,720
you can do dependency checking you can

174
00:06:22,720 --> 00:06:25,039
do dynamic testing infrastructure

175
00:06:25,039 --> 00:06:27,039
assessments or even container scanning a

176
00:06:27,039 --> 00:06:29,600
lot of things that we can do

177
00:06:29,600 --> 00:06:31,759
however even in that

178
00:06:31,759 --> 00:06:32,560
that

179
00:06:32,560 --> 00:06:34,720
attack surface you will see that things

180
00:06:34,720 --> 00:06:37,600
like business logic issues api security

181
00:06:37,600 --> 00:06:38,400
um

182
00:06:38,400 --> 00:06:40,080
issues around idols or session

183
00:06:40,080 --> 00:06:42,080
management a lot of these kind of issues

184
00:06:42,080 --> 00:06:43,919
which are not picked up by these

185
00:06:43,919 --> 00:06:46,400
products

186
00:06:47,199 --> 00:06:49,360
so i wanted to actually give you a quick

187
00:06:49,360 --> 00:06:51,520
idea of the extended attack surface that

188
00:06:51,520 --> 00:06:53,919
we are actually dealing with in terms of

189
00:06:53,919 --> 00:06:57,199
development um as it's a very rough uh

190
00:06:57,199 --> 00:06:58,960
sort of an indicator of what i'm trying

191
00:06:58,960 --> 00:07:00,960
to say but you know you understand in

192
00:07:00,960 --> 00:07:02,319
terms of these are the components in

193
00:07:02,319 --> 00:07:04,319
terms of the agile development

194
00:07:04,319 --> 00:07:06,400
environment you will have a developer

195
00:07:06,400 --> 00:07:08,000
who has you know who's pushing in the

196
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:10,560
custom code to source control and then

197
00:07:10,560 --> 00:07:12,160
there are a bunch of libraries that

198
00:07:12,160 --> 00:07:13,199
people in

199
00:07:13,199 --> 00:07:15,759
um we build that and you know create our

200
00:07:15,759 --> 00:07:18,319
container artifacts and essentially push

201
00:07:18,319 --> 00:07:20,560
that to production

202
00:07:20,560 --> 00:07:22,800
now it's not just these systems there

203
00:07:22,800 --> 00:07:24,560
are many other systems like at the back

204
00:07:24,560 --> 00:07:26,479
end like the data stores or databases

205
00:07:26,479 --> 00:07:28,400
that you're dealing with other public or

206
00:07:28,400 --> 00:07:29,840
private repositories from where you're

207
00:07:29,840 --> 00:07:31,680
pulling in your images

208
00:07:31,680 --> 00:07:33,680
and these are not just these instances

209
00:07:33,680 --> 00:07:35,360
that we are talking about when we say

210
00:07:35,360 --> 00:07:36,720
development

211
00:07:36,720 --> 00:07:38,960
particularly in agile we are also

212
00:07:38,960 --> 00:07:40,960
talking about all of these various

213
00:07:40,960 --> 00:07:43,919
actors who could be vulnerable or could

214
00:07:43,919 --> 00:07:46,160
be compromised in one way or another

215
00:07:46,160 --> 00:07:48,080
that means the real attack surface is

216
00:07:48,080 --> 00:07:50,319
not just any of these components which

217
00:07:50,319 --> 00:07:51,759
could be vulnerable

218
00:07:51,759 --> 00:07:53,360
um in fact i think there is there is a

219
00:07:53,360 --> 00:07:56,160
talk on the on ci fuzzing uh later today

220
00:07:56,160 --> 00:07:57,599
which you should definitely watch i will

221
00:07:57,599 --> 00:07:59,759
look out look out for it individually

222
00:07:59,759 --> 00:08:01,199
there are a lot of vulnerabilities that

223
00:08:01,199 --> 00:08:03,680
we can exploit for these components

224
00:08:03,680 --> 00:08:06,400
um but there are also a lot that can be

225
00:08:06,400 --> 00:08:08,479
done for the actors themselves who are

226
00:08:08,479 --> 00:08:10,560
maybe configuring these systems setting

227
00:08:10,560 --> 00:08:13,599
them up or writing the code base

228
00:08:13,599 --> 00:08:15,280
that means that

229
00:08:15,280 --> 00:08:17,599
there are a lot of other attacks that

230
00:08:17,599 --> 00:08:19,120
can happen as well like there are supply

231
00:08:19,120 --> 00:08:20,160
chain issues

232
00:08:20,160 --> 00:08:22,000
the social entering phishing endpoint

233
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:24,879
issues um and as you would remember

234
00:08:24,879 --> 00:08:26,879
recently uh you know there were a lot of

235
00:08:26,879 --> 00:08:29,199
zero days that sort of gave us a

236
00:08:29,199 --> 00:08:32,080
rollercoaster ride so those things are

237
00:08:32,080 --> 00:08:34,159
there as well

238
00:08:34,159 --> 00:08:36,880
so that brings us to the other point

239
00:08:36,880 --> 00:08:37,839
which is

240
00:08:37,839 --> 00:08:39,599
uh the other layer which you generally

241
00:08:39,599 --> 00:08:41,760
talk about which is people

242
00:08:41,760 --> 00:08:44,399
and people becomes then the center stage

243
00:08:44,399 --> 00:08:46,560
of if you are trying to make any

244
00:08:46,560 --> 00:08:48,959
long-term lasting impact in terms of

245
00:08:48,959 --> 00:08:51,599
security

246
00:08:52,880 --> 00:08:54,959
um when you talk about people in an

247
00:08:54,959 --> 00:08:57,120
agile development environment um the

248
00:08:57,120 --> 00:08:59,680
main set of folks that you will think of

249
00:08:59,680 --> 00:09:02,160
or who should be the centerpiece of your

250
00:09:02,160 --> 00:09:04,240
or the target audience that you have

251
00:09:04,240 --> 00:09:07,120
would be the development teams right so

252
00:09:07,120 --> 00:09:08,320
when you're mainly dealing with the

253
00:09:08,320 --> 00:09:10,240
developers or development teams what is

254
00:09:10,240 --> 00:09:11,920
it that you're supposed to look at when

255
00:09:11,920 --> 00:09:13,839
you're trying to actually drive a

256
00:09:13,839 --> 00:09:16,240
mindset change for them

257
00:09:16,240 --> 00:09:18,320
so essentially first try and understand

258
00:09:18,320 --> 00:09:20,080
what are their development challenges

259
00:09:20,080 --> 00:09:21,920
many times as security teams we forget

260
00:09:21,920 --> 00:09:23,519
to even think about it

261
00:09:23,519 --> 00:09:25,040
uh they're already being attained

262
00:09:25,040 --> 00:09:26,959
they're working towards you know faster

263
00:09:26,959 --> 00:09:29,040
time to markets they're working towards

264
00:09:29,040 --> 00:09:30,959
performance indicators that they have to

265
00:09:30,959 --> 00:09:32,560
meet usability environments that they

266
00:09:32,560 --> 00:09:34,160
have to meet and all of that they are

267
00:09:34,160 --> 00:09:38,399
doing in an entitled delivery timelines

268
00:09:38,399 --> 00:09:41,120
then uh before you go to them with uh

269
00:09:41,120 --> 00:09:42,800
with the product for automation it's

270
00:09:42,800 --> 00:09:44,560
important to understand what is their

271
00:09:44,560 --> 00:09:47,440
current tech context like for example

272
00:09:47,440 --> 00:09:48,959
how do they manage their dependencies

273
00:09:48,959 --> 00:09:51,040
currently right what is working for them

274
00:09:51,040 --> 00:09:54,080
what is their process of prs

275
00:09:54,080 --> 00:09:54,800
and

276
00:09:54,800 --> 00:09:56,880
if you are going to introduce a process

277
00:09:56,880 --> 00:09:58,160
change for them

278
00:09:58,160 --> 00:10:00,080
it's also important to see where they

279
00:10:00,080 --> 00:10:02,800
are in terms of for example awareness to

280
00:10:02,800 --> 00:10:04,560
even pick up that process and make the

281
00:10:04,560 --> 00:10:06,800
right sense of it and not just make it a

282
00:10:06,800 --> 00:10:10,880
checklist in their entire kind of things

283
00:10:10,959 --> 00:10:13,200
um and hence i uh

284
00:10:13,200 --> 00:10:15,519
came back i'm so so sorry to interrupt

285
00:10:15,519 --> 00:10:16,640
but i just want to give you a heads up

286
00:10:16,640 --> 00:10:18,160
that we're getting a lot of that static

287
00:10:18,160 --> 00:10:20,320
audio feedback again so if you can

288
00:10:20,320 --> 00:10:22,399
potentially reset and we'll just pause

289
00:10:22,399 --> 00:10:23,839
here for a moment

290
00:10:23,839 --> 00:10:26,240
okay

291
00:10:26,320 --> 00:10:28,640
i know how how it can feel so

292
00:10:28,640 --> 00:10:30,240
like no worries about the technical

293
00:10:30,240 --> 00:10:31,519
difficulties and stuff like that we'll

294
00:10:31,519 --> 00:10:33,279
get through it and we can uh adjust

295
00:10:33,279 --> 00:10:35,839
timing on things too okay

296
00:10:35,839 --> 00:10:38,240
cool no problem all right so

297
00:10:38,240 --> 00:10:39,839
just to continue

298
00:10:39,839 --> 00:10:41,360
where i left

299
00:10:41,360 --> 00:10:42,560
yeah thanks

300
00:10:42,560 --> 00:10:43,760
um

301
00:10:43,760 --> 00:10:45,920
when i came back and started

302
00:10:45,920 --> 00:10:47,519
looking at you know how do you drive

303
00:10:47,519 --> 00:10:49,519
that mindset change

304
00:10:49,519 --> 00:10:51,519
it was something that

305
00:10:51,519 --> 00:10:53,440
i was looking at more from a people

306
00:10:53,440 --> 00:10:55,040
standpoint and how do we bring about

307
00:10:55,040 --> 00:10:56,880
that cultural change

308
00:10:56,880 --> 00:10:59,200
i started designing a security change

309
00:10:59,200 --> 00:11:00,800
program that would bring about that

310
00:11:00,800 --> 00:11:01,680
change

311
00:11:01,680 --> 00:11:04,000
and the idea and goal for us was to

312
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:06,720
actually have security champions uh in

313
00:11:06,720 --> 00:11:09,600
every team who would sort of

314
00:11:09,600 --> 00:11:12,160
um catapult security into the the

315
00:11:12,160 --> 00:11:14,160
projects and and stay close and drive

316
00:11:14,160 --> 00:11:15,839
that culture change

317
00:11:15,839 --> 00:11:17,040
um

318
00:11:17,040 --> 00:11:19,680
so whenever you are in that journey as a

319
00:11:19,680 --> 00:11:21,040
security team when you are trying to

320
00:11:21,040 --> 00:11:23,279
design a program yourself there are some

321
00:11:23,279 --> 00:11:25,120
key considerations to look at when you

322
00:11:25,120 --> 00:11:26,399
are starting that

323
00:11:26,399 --> 00:11:28,000
so the first thing is keep the problem

324
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:29,920
statement in mind uh many times there

325
00:11:29,920 --> 00:11:31,440
are so many issues that we are dealing

326
00:11:31,440 --> 00:11:33,040
with that you know we get into rabbit

327
00:11:33,040 --> 00:11:35,120
holes so you have to understand what is

328
00:11:35,120 --> 00:11:36,959
the problem that you are solving for and

329
00:11:36,959 --> 00:11:39,120
how relevant it is for your target

330
00:11:39,120 --> 00:11:40,800
audience in this case the development

331
00:11:40,800 --> 00:11:41,680
teams

332
00:11:41,680 --> 00:11:43,360
and what kind of outcomes you're looking

333
00:11:43,360 --> 00:11:44,320
at

334
00:11:44,320 --> 00:11:46,000
secondly look at the stakeholders that

335
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:48,240
you have it could be the participants

336
00:11:48,240 --> 00:11:50,480
the development teams themselves uh it

337
00:11:50,480 --> 00:11:53,040
could also be uh for example influencers

338
00:11:53,040 --> 00:11:54,959
and projects right who you want to work

339
00:11:54,959 --> 00:11:57,440
with to take this further ahead also the

340
00:11:57,440 --> 00:11:59,120
leaders in your organization and stuff

341
00:11:59,120 --> 00:12:00,320
like that

342
00:12:00,320 --> 00:12:03,200
um and finally also look at basic things

343
00:12:03,200 --> 00:12:04,560
like tech stacks you know what are the

344
00:12:04,560 --> 00:12:06,399
technical constraints where the budget

345
00:12:06,399 --> 00:12:08,320
you're working with the timelines that

346
00:12:08,320 --> 00:12:10,079
you're working with things like for

347
00:12:10,079 --> 00:12:12,160
example timeline is not just delivery

348
00:12:12,160 --> 00:12:13,920
timelines but also the time that the

349
00:12:13,920 --> 00:12:15,680
teams will have to invest

350
00:12:15,680 --> 00:12:19,680
in your program once that rolls out

351
00:12:19,680 --> 00:12:21,839
secondly when you're creating a program

352
00:12:21,839 --> 00:12:23,839
always keep in mind to make it lean

353
00:12:23,839 --> 00:12:25,200
because you're doing it for an agile

354
00:12:25,200 --> 00:12:26,720
development environment

355
00:12:26,720 --> 00:12:29,839
so for example in in our case when i

356
00:12:29,839 --> 00:12:31,839
started we had this whole nine step

357
00:12:31,839 --> 00:12:32,880
process

358
00:12:32,880 --> 00:12:35,279
to go through to the right outcome and

359
00:12:35,279 --> 00:12:37,680
it did work for us for the initial

360
00:12:37,680 --> 00:12:38,959
pilots

361
00:12:38,959 --> 00:12:41,600
but what we did was soon we came back to

362
00:12:41,600 --> 00:12:44,160
brainstorm and make it much

363
00:12:44,160 --> 00:12:46,399
uh leaner from that perspective so that

364
00:12:46,399 --> 00:12:48,959
we could roll it out to you know larger

365
00:12:48,959 --> 00:12:50,560
set of teams because we were to work

366
00:12:50,560 --> 00:12:52,639
with hundreds of teams after that so we

367
00:12:52,639 --> 00:12:54,959
made it very simple three-step process

368
00:12:54,959 --> 00:12:57,360
on including onboarding where we would

369
00:12:57,360 --> 00:13:00,160
focus on awareness workshops where we

370
00:13:00,160 --> 00:13:01,839
would focus on more practical

371
00:13:01,839 --> 00:13:03,519
high-intensity tasks which we would

372
00:13:03,519 --> 00:13:06,079
enable the the sect charms for and

373
00:13:06,079 --> 00:13:09,359
followed by governance

374
00:13:09,519 --> 00:13:10,800
when you are defining any process

375
00:13:10,800 --> 00:13:12,959
changes that you want

376
00:13:12,959 --> 00:13:14,959
them to pick up the teams to pick up for

377
00:13:14,959 --> 00:13:16,079
your program

378
00:13:16,079 --> 00:13:18,560
it's very essential when doing that for

379
00:13:18,560 --> 00:13:20,639
an agile environment is to align with

380
00:13:20,639 --> 00:13:22,720
the key agile rituals

381
00:13:22,720 --> 00:13:24,800
uh that ways what happens is it ensures

382
00:13:24,800 --> 00:13:26,800
that it becomes a practice for them and

383
00:13:26,800 --> 00:13:28,320
and that it becomes more like muscle

384
00:13:28,320 --> 00:13:29,920
memory right when they're doing

385
00:13:29,920 --> 00:13:32,720
development so in our case when we had

386
00:13:32,720 --> 00:13:35,040
threat modeling like at at the heart of

387
00:13:35,040 --> 00:13:37,440
what we were trying to enable them for

388
00:13:37,440 --> 00:13:40,160
and um for example for iterations right

389
00:13:40,160 --> 00:13:42,480
we would have a sprint plan or an

390
00:13:42,480 --> 00:13:44,959
initial iteration planning meeting so

391
00:13:44,959 --> 00:13:46,720
when that ritual happens we made sure

392
00:13:46,720 --> 00:13:49,120
that we are looking at we are the teams

393
00:13:49,120 --> 00:13:50,800
are picking up the features right at

394
00:13:50,800 --> 00:13:52,959
that time for which feature would be

395
00:13:52,959 --> 00:13:54,320
threat modeled you know in that

396
00:13:54,320 --> 00:13:55,760
iteration

397
00:13:55,760 --> 00:13:58,959
secondly rotate and iterate so uh it's

398
00:13:58,959 --> 00:14:01,920
important to have frequent but smaller

399
00:14:01,920 --> 00:14:04,079
threat modeling in this in this parlance

400
00:14:04,079 --> 00:14:06,560
is to do it more frequently but in small

401
00:14:06,560 --> 00:14:08,240
sizes so for example rather than doing

402
00:14:08,240 --> 00:14:10,240
an entire thread modelling for an entire

403
00:14:10,240 --> 00:14:13,440
application we would uh rather focus on

404
00:14:13,440 --> 00:14:15,519
smaller threat modeling on features but

405
00:14:15,519 --> 00:14:17,360
do it more frequently

406
00:14:17,360 --> 00:14:18,880
thirdly make it official you know

407
00:14:18,880 --> 00:14:21,279
whatever threats that came out of our

408
00:14:21,279 --> 00:14:23,120
threat modeling we're supposed to go to

409
00:14:23,120 --> 00:14:24,959
the project dashboard so for example

410
00:14:24,959 --> 00:14:27,279
your jira or your confluence you can add

411
00:14:27,279 --> 00:14:29,760
it to that directly

412
00:14:29,760 --> 00:14:32,560
secure your source so it's good to start

413
00:14:32,560 --> 00:14:35,120
with secure defaults uh create for

414
00:14:35,120 --> 00:14:37,199
example baseline secure baseline images

415
00:14:37,199 --> 00:14:38,560
or or

416
00:14:38,560 --> 00:14:41,600
harden configuration or a safer code

417
00:14:41,600 --> 00:14:43,680
base to start off with totally depends

418
00:14:43,680 --> 00:14:46,720
on the program that you are going for

419
00:14:46,720 --> 00:14:49,279
in our case for example we had in terms

420
00:14:49,279 --> 00:14:51,040
of threat modeling because that was at

421
00:14:51,040 --> 00:14:52,959
the core of this program we were

422
00:14:52,959 --> 00:14:54,720
focusing on giving them an initial set

423
00:14:54,720 --> 00:14:56,800
of scenarios that they could look in the

424
00:14:56,800 --> 00:14:58,880
context of which were generally the

425
00:14:58,880 --> 00:15:01,279
commonly occurring scenarios for for our

426
00:15:01,279 --> 00:15:02,800
teams

427
00:15:02,800 --> 00:15:05,040
and lastly uh

428
00:15:05,040 --> 00:15:06,880
leverage the pipeline so

429
00:15:06,880 --> 00:15:08,639
i think this has been discussed a lot

430
00:15:08,639 --> 00:15:10,959
and tremendously in in-depth

431
00:15:10,959 --> 00:15:13,600
so i will not uh speak too much about it

432
00:15:13,600 --> 00:15:15,440
it's important it's a very special place

433
00:15:15,440 --> 00:15:16,959
in development where you can add and

434
00:15:16,959 --> 00:15:19,279
automate a lot of stuff so leverage that

435
00:15:19,279 --> 00:15:21,040
but ensure that you have the right kind

436
00:15:21,040 --> 00:15:23,760
of api set for it for example when does

437
00:15:23,760 --> 00:15:26,399
it really break the build you know or do

438
00:15:26,399 --> 00:15:29,040
you have the slas to go ahead and fix

439
00:15:29,040 --> 00:15:30,800
the high critical issues that you found

440
00:15:30,800 --> 00:15:34,319
in that particular run

441
00:15:34,720 --> 00:15:35,600
so

442
00:15:35,600 --> 00:15:37,040
before

443
00:15:37,040 --> 00:15:39,519
going in with it we had the onboarding

444
00:15:39,519 --> 00:15:41,600
process where we're looking at awareness

445
00:15:41,600 --> 00:15:44,079
but some important things to do when

446
00:15:44,079 --> 00:15:46,399
you're going for developer awareness is

447
00:15:46,399 --> 00:15:48,399
apart from the general awareness that

448
00:15:48,399 --> 00:15:50,000
you're looking at it's also important to

449
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:53,040
look at role specific trainings uh in

450
00:15:53,040 --> 00:15:54,800
the sense that what can they do in their

451
00:15:54,800 --> 00:15:56,959
respective roles so we know that a

452
00:15:56,959 --> 00:16:00,639
developer can code securely um a ba

453
00:16:00,639 --> 00:16:01,920
they will be gathering requirements

454
00:16:01,920 --> 00:16:03,680
right so they should be explicitly

455
00:16:03,680 --> 00:16:06,079
asking for security requirements as well

456
00:16:06,079 --> 00:16:07,920
and they should be adding that as

457
00:16:07,920 --> 00:16:10,079
acceptance criteria in their stories as

458
00:16:10,079 --> 00:16:12,000
well so those are the kind of things

459
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:13,680
that you want to tell them and how to do

460
00:16:13,680 --> 00:16:14,800
that

461
00:16:14,800 --> 00:16:16,639
so that the securities everyone's

462
00:16:16,639 --> 00:16:19,040
responsibility actually becomes true

463
00:16:19,040 --> 00:16:19,839
um

464
00:16:19,839 --> 00:16:21,120
secondly there are many times that we

465
00:16:21,120 --> 00:16:22,880
create a lot of these baselines and

466
00:16:22,880 --> 00:16:25,199
checklists and you know um

467
00:16:25,199 --> 00:16:26,880
even images and stuff that i was talking

468
00:16:26,880 --> 00:16:28,800
about but many times developers may not

469
00:16:28,800 --> 00:16:29,680
have

470
00:16:29,680 --> 00:16:32,240
uh awareness around that so do they know

471
00:16:32,240 --> 00:16:34,079
where it is can they just pick up and

472
00:16:34,079 --> 00:16:35,680
run with it when they are starting off

473
00:16:35,680 --> 00:16:36,880
their projects

474
00:16:36,880 --> 00:16:39,440
is something you should ask yourself

475
00:16:39,440 --> 00:16:42,639
and lastly look at a format of awareness

476
00:16:42,639 --> 00:16:45,519
where they can stay updated there are so

477
00:16:45,519 --> 00:16:47,759
many new attacks coming up every day are

478
00:16:47,759 --> 00:16:50,560
they updated about these recent patches

479
00:16:50,560 --> 00:16:52,240
any recent issues that affect their

480
00:16:52,240 --> 00:16:53,759
systems

481
00:16:53,759 --> 00:16:55,279
so things like that should be discussed

482
00:16:55,279 --> 00:16:57,600
very very frequently and one efficient

483
00:16:57,600 --> 00:17:00,480
way of doing that we figured was to

484
00:17:00,480 --> 00:17:02,880
create and nurture a community of all of

485
00:17:02,880 --> 00:17:04,959
these people so we create a community of

486
00:17:04,959 --> 00:17:07,119
created a community of spectrums where

487
00:17:07,119 --> 00:17:09,520
everyone especially sections and the

488
00:17:09,520 --> 00:17:10,880
development teams could actually

489
00:17:10,880 --> 00:17:13,839
interact around more hands-on fixes and

490
00:17:13,839 --> 00:17:15,199
you know talking to each other about

491
00:17:15,199 --> 00:17:17,439
these daily issues which they could then

492
00:17:17,439 --> 00:17:19,280
pick up and and you know discuss with

493
00:17:19,280 --> 00:17:21,839
each other and as well

494
00:17:21,839 --> 00:17:23,760
um in our case

495
00:17:23,760 --> 00:17:25,919
i'm so so sorry to interrupt again i

496
00:17:25,919 --> 00:17:27,599
don't mean to keep doing this to you but

497
00:17:27,599 --> 00:17:29,039
that's that it keeps creeping back in

498
00:17:29,039 --> 00:17:31,039
somehow for some reason

499
00:17:31,039 --> 00:17:33,280
for us we were looking at so in terms of

500
00:17:33,280 --> 00:17:35,600
awareness uh we were looking at agile

501
00:17:35,600 --> 00:17:38,160
threat modeling and what we were

502
00:17:38,160 --> 00:17:40,320
particularly trying to do is apart from

503
00:17:40,320 --> 00:17:41,919
the academic side of it you know apart

504
00:17:41,919 --> 00:17:43,679
from understanding how to do a

505
00:17:43,679 --> 00:17:46,559
strike-based threat modeling uh quickly

506
00:17:46,559 --> 00:17:48,640
we were looking at how to operationalize

507
00:17:48,640 --> 00:17:50,400
this better we were looking at

508
00:17:50,400 --> 00:17:52,000
essentially telling them how you can

509
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:53,840
time it better rather than running into

510
00:17:53,840 --> 00:17:56,400
rabbit holes uh we were trying to tell

511
00:17:56,400 --> 00:17:58,840
them um or teaching them

512
00:17:58,840 --> 00:18:01,440
around getting together and adding their

513
00:18:01,440 --> 00:18:02,799
perspective when they're doing threat

514
00:18:02,799 --> 00:18:04,799
modeling how do they prioritize issues

515
00:18:04,799 --> 00:18:07,280
so once you have the threads out how do

516
00:18:07,280 --> 00:18:09,200
you prioritize the issues and add them

517
00:18:09,200 --> 00:18:10,720
to your project dashboard how do you

518
00:18:10,720 --> 00:18:12,559
turn them into either acceptance

519
00:18:12,559 --> 00:18:14,400
criteria or stories

520
00:18:14,400 --> 00:18:17,039
um and or or tasks for that matter and

521
00:18:17,039 --> 00:18:19,120
then add them to the project dashboard

522
00:18:19,120 --> 00:18:20,799
so these were the practical aspects that

523
00:18:20,799 --> 00:18:22,400
we wanted to focus on something that

524
00:18:22,400 --> 00:18:24,240
they could pick up would be more

525
00:18:24,240 --> 00:18:26,000
hands-on for them and they could pick up

526
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:29,760
and do it in a more agile fashion

527
00:18:29,760 --> 00:18:31,919
for communication uh one important thing

528
00:18:31,919 --> 00:18:34,080
to understand is try and leverage as

529
00:18:34,080 --> 00:18:35,600
many channels of communication as

530
00:18:35,600 --> 00:18:38,080
possible uh emails

531
00:18:38,080 --> 00:18:40,080
you know chat channels create channels

532
00:18:40,080 --> 00:18:43,120
if there are not any um but

533
00:18:43,120 --> 00:18:45,120
in an agile development environment what

534
00:18:45,120 --> 00:18:46,960
i have seen works best is the face to

535
00:18:46,960 --> 00:18:49,840
face communication and that

536
00:18:49,840 --> 00:18:51,840
i think stays for a very long period of

537
00:18:51,840 --> 00:18:52,640
time

538
00:18:52,640 --> 00:18:54,000
in the past couple of years that has

539
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:56,000
become really difficult but even when

540
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:58,160
wherever you can interact with smaller

541
00:18:58,160 --> 00:19:00,480
groups uh or pair with you know

542
00:19:00,480 --> 00:19:02,559
developer teams rather than just

543
00:19:02,559 --> 00:19:04,480
remotely or working in silos and just

544
00:19:04,480 --> 00:19:08,240
sending an email and forgetting about it

545
00:19:08,320 --> 00:19:10,160
one thing to keep in mind as a security

546
00:19:10,160 --> 00:19:12,799
team is to change our own mindset before

547
00:19:12,799 --> 00:19:14,960
we go to the developers asking them to

548
00:19:14,960 --> 00:19:18,400
change the mindset so in this case uh

549
00:19:18,400 --> 00:19:20,720
focus on people interactions rather than

550
00:19:20,720 --> 00:19:23,600
you know set standards that you may have

551
00:19:23,600 --> 00:19:25,039
remember that

552
00:19:25,039 --> 00:19:26,880
to make

553
00:19:26,880 --> 00:19:28,559
you know the function secure you will

554
00:19:28,559 --> 00:19:30,240
have to make security functional so

555
00:19:30,240 --> 00:19:33,919
always go with a working solution

556
00:19:34,080 --> 00:19:36,400
third very important is to collaborate

557
00:19:36,400 --> 00:19:38,480
with the teams as much as possible you

558
00:19:38,480 --> 00:19:40,080
know sit down pair with developers or

559
00:19:40,080 --> 00:19:41,679
pair with devops and and all of these

560
00:19:41,679 --> 00:19:43,200
individual roles and understand what

561
00:19:43,200 --> 00:19:44,640
their challenges are

562
00:19:44,640 --> 00:19:45,919
and lastly

563
00:19:45,919 --> 00:19:48,400
uh adapt to changes in technology red

564
00:19:48,400 --> 00:19:51,200
technology for for development teams is

565
00:19:51,200 --> 00:19:53,200
actually changing really fast so we

566
00:19:53,200 --> 00:19:55,440
should adapt to technology as much as

567
00:19:55,440 --> 00:19:57,919
possible

568
00:19:58,160 --> 00:20:00,400
how do you engage uh the developers

569
00:20:00,400 --> 00:20:02,000
which in our case we were mostly looking

570
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:04,080
at sections and their engagement one

571
00:20:04,080 --> 00:20:05,280
thing that

572
00:20:05,280 --> 00:20:07,440
that i would like to share is

573
00:20:07,440 --> 00:20:09,200
rather than you whenever we go to the

574
00:20:09,200 --> 00:20:11,120
team sometimes we make that mistake of

575
00:20:11,120 --> 00:20:13,360
throwing in security words or keywords

576
00:20:13,360 --> 00:20:14,799
or jargons like for example rather than

577
00:20:14,799 --> 00:20:16,000
telling them

578
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:19,120
zero trust on the first day it's always

579
00:20:19,120 --> 00:20:20,960
good to start off with discussing more

580
00:20:20,960 --> 00:20:24,400
concrete and actionable tasks um or

581
00:20:24,400 --> 00:20:26,799
items that they can take up maybe before

582
00:20:26,799 --> 00:20:28,720
the next stand up you know something

583
00:20:28,720 --> 00:20:29,679
like that

584
00:20:29,679 --> 00:20:32,159
um secondly keep them motivated as much

585
00:20:32,159 --> 00:20:34,720
as possible and aware of of the recent

586
00:20:34,720 --> 00:20:38,000
issues uh one great way of motivating

587
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:40,480
these set of folks is to let them own

588
00:20:40,480 --> 00:20:42,480
their journey rate let them own the

589
00:20:42,480 --> 00:20:44,080
changes that they want to make in their

590
00:20:44,080 --> 00:20:46,159
projects be it automation be around

591
00:20:46,159 --> 00:20:48,080
adding some other controls and process

592
00:20:48,080 --> 00:20:49,840
changes and stuff like that once you

593
00:20:49,840 --> 00:20:51,840
have told them what the goal is let them

594
00:20:51,840 --> 00:20:54,000
own that

595
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:55,600
and lastly you can also gamify the

596
00:20:55,600 --> 00:20:57,120
experience right so across your

597
00:20:57,120 --> 00:20:59,919
organization or delivery organization

598
00:20:59,919 --> 00:21:01,520
if you're looking at engaging these

599
00:21:01,520 --> 00:21:03,760
people or all the development teams way

600
00:21:03,760 --> 00:21:06,400
more it's always good to gamify that how

601
00:21:06,400 --> 00:21:08,000
can you do that maybe you know you might

602
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:10,000
have heard of the systems of badges or

603
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:12,159
levels different levels in security so

604
00:21:12,159 --> 00:21:13,520
it's always good to create something

605
00:21:13,520 --> 00:21:15,760
like that where they can move from one

606
00:21:15,760 --> 00:21:17,840
batch to another and always look forward

607
00:21:17,840 --> 00:21:19,919
to something new so that sort of brings

608
00:21:19,919 --> 00:21:21,520
in a healthy competition as well for

609
00:21:21,520 --> 00:21:23,520
them

610
00:21:23,520 --> 00:21:25,200
so rather than giving them a one-time

611
00:21:25,200 --> 00:21:27,200
solution it's

612
00:21:27,200 --> 00:21:29,600
rather good to teach them how to fish

613
00:21:29,600 --> 00:21:31,600
that's the idea

614
00:21:31,600 --> 00:21:33,360
so all of this works well in a smaller

615
00:21:33,360 --> 00:21:35,840
scale and it worked well for our pilots

616
00:21:35,840 --> 00:21:36,720
also

617
00:21:36,720 --> 00:21:39,520
but when you move on to address this at

618
00:21:39,520 --> 00:21:41,360
scale like with you know in our case it

619
00:21:41,360 --> 00:21:42,960
was hundreds of teams that we were going

620
00:21:42,960 --> 00:21:44,559
to roll it out

621
00:21:44,559 --> 00:21:46,799
i have some more learnings to share

622
00:21:46,799 --> 00:21:49,120
first thing is simplify the goals as

623
00:21:49,120 --> 00:21:50,960
much as possible so that everyone

624
00:21:50,960 --> 00:21:52,400
including

625
00:21:52,400 --> 00:21:55,280
a developer or a leader understands it

626
00:21:55,280 --> 00:21:57,120
equally well and everyone is on the same

627
00:21:57,120 --> 00:21:59,120
page you know that ways it becomes very

628
00:21:59,120 --> 00:22:01,039
easy to interpret solutions that you are

629
00:22:01,039 --> 00:22:04,000
recommending as well

630
00:22:05,120 --> 00:22:06,640
atomic success

631
00:22:06,640 --> 00:22:07,440
is

632
00:22:07,440 --> 00:22:10,320
very important before you get success at

633
00:22:10,320 --> 00:22:11,280
scale

634
00:22:11,280 --> 00:22:13,039
which means that for if you're

635
00:22:13,039 --> 00:22:15,280
introducing a process of practice always

636
00:22:15,280 --> 00:22:17,520
try and test it on some of the teams it

637
00:22:17,520 --> 00:22:20,080
has to succeed in in a unit scale so

638
00:22:20,080 --> 00:22:21,440
whether you're looking at unit being

639
00:22:21,440 --> 00:22:24,080
your project or it being your squad or

640
00:22:24,080 --> 00:22:25,440
streams

641
00:22:25,440 --> 00:22:27,600
it should succeed or succeed there and

642
00:22:27,600 --> 00:22:29,760
work well there for it to function well

643
00:22:29,760 --> 00:22:32,240
at scale

644
00:22:32,960 --> 00:22:34,000
thirdly

645
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:35,840
having a set of secure defaults really

646
00:22:35,840 --> 00:22:37,760
helps so whatever be your program that

647
00:22:37,760 --> 00:22:39,440
you're building it around it's good to

648
00:22:39,440 --> 00:22:41,200
have a set of secure defaults to start

649
00:22:41,200 --> 00:22:43,600
off with now what it really helps with

650
00:22:43,600 --> 00:22:45,679
is to give that

651
00:22:45,679 --> 00:22:48,320
a quick win to to the developers also

652
00:22:48,320 --> 00:22:50,080
and once they have that quick win it's

653
00:22:50,080 --> 00:22:51,760
like a win-win situation where they can

654
00:22:51,760 --> 00:22:53,520
start psychologically at a stronger

655
00:22:53,520 --> 00:22:55,520
place and then they stick for a longer

656
00:22:55,520 --> 00:22:58,080
time to the changes that you might have

657
00:22:58,080 --> 00:23:01,280
recommended through your program

658
00:23:02,159 --> 00:23:04,640
um the other thing that is important

659
00:23:04,640 --> 00:23:06,400
while doing that is

660
00:23:06,400 --> 00:23:08,320
remember what you're in for so you are

661
00:23:08,320 --> 00:23:10,240
trying to drive a mindset change and

662
00:23:10,240 --> 00:23:12,240
it's very important to build a mindset

663
00:23:12,240 --> 00:23:15,760
for edge cases so uh

664
00:23:15,760 --> 00:23:17,679
essentially take them through the entire

665
00:23:17,679 --> 00:23:19,440
journey that you will have as as a

666
00:23:19,440 --> 00:23:20,799
security person right if you were

667
00:23:20,799 --> 00:23:22,799
playing all of these roles you would ask

668
00:23:22,799 --> 00:23:25,039
yourself questions or try to answer some

669
00:23:25,039 --> 00:23:26,880
of those security questions are they

670
00:23:26,880 --> 00:23:28,480
asking those questions do they have a

671
00:23:28,480 --> 00:23:30,080
critical mindset

672
00:23:30,080 --> 00:23:31,840
while they are playing their role within

673
00:23:31,840 --> 00:23:33,440
the development team so that is

674
00:23:33,440 --> 00:23:35,679
something to look for

675
00:23:35,679 --> 00:23:38,159
leverage automation wherever possible

676
00:23:38,159 --> 00:23:40,320
once they start you know identifying

677
00:23:40,320 --> 00:23:42,320
threats early on in the life cycle they

678
00:23:42,320 --> 00:23:44,799
will start seeing more

679
00:23:44,799 --> 00:23:47,039
things or issues that can be predicted

680
00:23:47,039 --> 00:23:49,919
early on and or are recurring and can be

681
00:23:49,919 --> 00:23:51,840
automated so for example if there is a

682
00:23:51,840 --> 00:23:53,919
solution to add

683
00:23:53,919 --> 00:23:56,400
stages right to a certain type of

684
00:23:56,400 --> 00:23:57,520
pipeline and you're dealing with

685
00:23:57,520 --> 00:23:59,840
multiple different kind of ci's in your

686
00:23:59,840 --> 00:24:02,159
environment then what's created for one

687
00:24:02,159 --> 00:24:04,159
can be reused for another always

688
00:24:04,159 --> 00:24:05,760
depending on how many different teams

689
00:24:05,760 --> 00:24:07,919
are using that so leverage that as much

690
00:24:07,919 --> 00:24:10,080
as possible

691
00:24:10,080 --> 00:24:12,320
when you're introducing processes or

692
00:24:12,320 --> 00:24:14,720
practices uh it's important that they're

693
00:24:14,720 --> 00:24:16,960
effective so the first thing to ensure

694
00:24:16,960 --> 00:24:18,799
that is that you align with your agile

695
00:24:18,799 --> 00:24:20,720
development life cycle you know the

696
00:24:20,720 --> 00:24:23,039
delivery timelines the life cycle

697
00:24:23,039 --> 00:24:25,200
and the rituals like i was talking about

698
00:24:25,200 --> 00:24:26,480
and you are when you are adding

699
00:24:26,480 --> 00:24:28,320
practices uh ensure that they are

700
00:24:28,320 --> 00:24:30,159
effective and they are driving a

701
00:24:30,159 --> 00:24:32,320
behavior change so if you have an option

702
00:24:32,320 --> 00:24:33,279
of

703
00:24:33,279 --> 00:24:35,200
two processes or two different ways of

704
00:24:35,200 --> 00:24:37,360
doing something similar it's always good

705
00:24:37,360 --> 00:24:39,200
to bank on the one that will drive the

706
00:24:39,200 --> 00:24:42,640
behavior change in the long run

707
00:24:42,799 --> 00:24:44,400
and lastly

708
00:24:44,400 --> 00:24:45,840
communicate the why i think this is

709
00:24:45,840 --> 00:24:47,919
something that i cannot emphasize enough

710
00:24:47,919 --> 00:24:51,120
uh i uh realized this only when we you

711
00:24:51,120 --> 00:24:52,960
know started addressing this issue at

712
00:24:52,960 --> 00:24:54,640
scale and then we started working with

713
00:24:54,640 --> 00:24:56,480
hundreds of spectrums

714
00:24:56,480 --> 00:24:59,679
the initial part of clearing the why

715
00:24:59,679 --> 00:25:02,240
becomes or helps you way

716
00:25:02,240 --> 00:25:04,480
longer in the program or until much

717
00:25:04,480 --> 00:25:06,000
later you know so

718
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:08,159
for us this is an ongoing program and

719
00:25:08,159 --> 00:25:10,559
once this why part is clear for all of

720
00:25:10,559 --> 00:25:12,799
them and all the stakeholders there are

721
00:25:12,799 --> 00:25:14,559
much lesser questions and there are way

722
00:25:14,559 --> 00:25:17,840
more solutions so the overall attitude

723
00:25:17,840 --> 00:25:18,640
of

724
00:25:18,640 --> 00:25:20,880
uh your target audience will definitely

725
00:25:20,880 --> 00:25:22,799
improve and become way more positive if

726
00:25:22,799 --> 00:25:26,080
you have clarified the why for them

727
00:25:26,080 --> 00:25:28,080
so some of the results from what we had

728
00:25:28,080 --> 00:25:30,480
done earlier um for this

729
00:25:30,480 --> 00:25:32,240
uh we started with the pilot a bunch of

730
00:25:32,240 --> 00:25:34,480
teams and then we started doubling up on

731
00:25:34,480 --> 00:25:37,200
how many teams we wanted to uh roll this

732
00:25:37,200 --> 00:25:38,320
out to

733
00:25:38,320 --> 00:25:41,039
um some of the the early wins for us

734
00:25:41,039 --> 00:25:43,520
where essentially discovering hundreds

735
00:25:43,520 --> 00:25:46,000
of threats we soon started discovering

736
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:48,640
hundreds of threats alongside the sec

737
00:25:48,640 --> 00:25:50,559
champs and the development teams and

738
00:25:50,559 --> 00:25:52,400
also fixing the high critical issues

739
00:25:52,400 --> 00:25:53,840
from there

740
00:25:53,840 --> 00:25:55,440
sec champs soon became the point of

741
00:25:55,440 --> 00:25:57,279
contact for security and everybody

742
00:25:57,279 --> 00:25:58,960
started reaching out to them internally

743
00:25:58,960 --> 00:26:01,360
and externally for anything to do with

744
00:26:01,360 --> 00:26:03,760
security so now everybody become way

745
00:26:03,760 --> 00:26:05,600
more proactive

746
00:26:05,600 --> 00:26:07,520
and one of the things that

747
00:26:07,520 --> 00:26:09,440
definitely changed for us which was not

748
00:26:09,440 --> 00:26:11,360
the goal of the program but was quite

749
00:26:11,360 --> 00:26:13,360
interesting is that the entire push

750
00:26:13,360 --> 00:26:15,600
model that security generally struggles

751
00:26:15,600 --> 00:26:18,640
with became a full model so initially we

752
00:26:18,640 --> 00:26:20,320
would reach out to teams for them to

753
00:26:20,320 --> 00:26:21,600
enroll for

754
00:26:21,600 --> 00:26:23,360
the sec champ program

755
00:26:23,360 --> 00:26:26,000
and as of today all the new teams that

756
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:28,000
are coming up they reach our course

757
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:29,600
directly to enroll for the program

758
00:26:29,600 --> 00:26:32,320
themselves uh even for that matter for

759
00:26:32,320 --> 00:26:35,120
doing a threat modeling so they would

760
00:26:35,120 --> 00:26:36,480
loop us in when they are doing a threat

761
00:26:36,480 --> 00:26:37,919
modeling or let us know that how many

762
00:26:37,919 --> 00:26:40,320
issues they have and what are they

763
00:26:40,320 --> 00:26:41,679
prioritizing

764
00:26:41,679 --> 00:26:44,000
so that makes the job of if you have

765
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:45,919
been a security team

766
00:26:45,919 --> 00:26:48,159
that makes your job much much easier

767
00:26:48,159 --> 00:26:51,679
than working in a push model

768
00:26:51,679 --> 00:26:54,799
so in an ideal setup how the people will

769
00:26:54,799 --> 00:26:56,640
play a role in the development would be

770
00:26:56,640 --> 00:26:59,039
something like this where you are going

771
00:26:59,039 --> 00:27:00,080
through

772
00:27:00,080 --> 00:27:01,600
ensure that the development teams are

773
00:27:01,600 --> 00:27:02,960
going through their role specific

774
00:27:02,960 --> 00:27:05,919
awareness but also the tech tax specific

775
00:27:05,919 --> 00:27:08,000
trainings you know because before you

776
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:09,279
start development you generally know

777
00:27:09,279 --> 00:27:10,640
what is the kind of tech stack that you

778
00:27:10,640 --> 00:27:12,159
are going to work with

779
00:27:12,159 --> 00:27:14,720
um when you are in the design phase uh

780
00:27:14,720 --> 00:27:16,480
leverage threat modeling

781
00:27:16,480 --> 00:27:19,600
to identify threads early on but not in

782
00:27:19,600 --> 00:27:20,480
silos

783
00:27:20,480 --> 00:27:22,960
or not only with a security expert but

784
00:27:22,960 --> 00:27:24,960
the entire team should be involved along

785
00:27:24,960 --> 00:27:28,000
with your sec champs if you have any

786
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:29,679
once you have your security backlog

787
00:27:29,679 --> 00:27:32,159
created ensure that all of these

788
00:27:32,159 --> 00:27:34,960
security acceptance criteria or stories

789
00:27:34,960 --> 00:27:37,279
or features that you may have discussed

790
00:27:37,279 --> 00:27:40,080
are moving to the project dashboard and

791
00:27:40,080 --> 00:27:43,120
you allocate the developer a deaf pair

792
00:27:43,120 --> 00:27:44,880
or a bandwidth for that

793
00:27:44,880 --> 00:27:46,960
to address that issue

794
00:27:46,960 --> 00:27:48,799
once you start development definitely

795
00:27:48,799 --> 00:27:51,279
leverage automation um for every

796
00:27:51,279 --> 00:27:53,520
everything including sas or dust or you

797
00:27:53,520 --> 00:27:54,880
know your container scanning and things

798
00:27:54,880 --> 00:27:57,679
like that but towards the end of it uh

799
00:27:57,679 --> 00:28:00,240
take time to have sort of a retro like

800
00:28:00,240 --> 00:28:02,799
reflect upon or inspect upon what are

801
00:28:02,799 --> 00:28:05,520
the issues that you got from

802
00:28:05,520 --> 00:28:07,840
the threat modeling that you did or from

803
00:28:07,840 --> 00:28:09,919
the automated runs or even for example

804
00:28:09,919 --> 00:28:11,360
if you are doing an external vendor

805
00:28:11,360 --> 00:28:13,200
assessment what are the kind of issues

806
00:28:13,200 --> 00:28:14,240
you are getting

807
00:28:14,240 --> 00:28:15,760
how many of those are really recurring

808
00:28:15,760 --> 00:28:18,159
which can be coded right or can be coded

809
00:28:18,159 --> 00:28:20,480
into security unit test for example or

810
00:28:20,480 --> 00:28:22,320
can be addressed through design or

811
00:28:22,320 --> 00:28:24,159
through acceptance criteria in your

812
00:28:24,159 --> 00:28:26,880
future stories

813
00:28:26,880 --> 00:28:28,799
so for a mature security team it will

814
00:28:28,799 --> 00:28:31,760
mostly look like this where they are

815
00:28:31,760 --> 00:28:33,520
it's much easier for them to get into

816
00:28:33,520 --> 00:28:35,760
security huddles like huddles in the

817
00:28:35,760 --> 00:28:37,360
sense you can just pick up a feature and

818
00:28:37,360 --> 00:28:39,440
start looking at doing a quick threat

819
00:28:39,440 --> 00:28:40,960
modeling or

820
00:28:40,960 --> 00:28:43,120
checking the workflow for security

821
00:28:43,120 --> 00:28:45,520
threats iterative threat modeling become

822
00:28:45,520 --> 00:28:47,200
a common thing

823
00:28:47,200 --> 00:28:48,880
when you're defining the acceptance

824
00:28:48,880 --> 00:28:51,039
criteria for your stories it should show

825
00:28:51,039 --> 00:28:52,720
the security validations essentially

826
00:28:52,720 --> 00:28:54,799
should be showing in those those stories

827
00:28:54,799 --> 00:28:57,279
as well which can be tested later by a

828
00:28:57,279 --> 00:28:59,039
qa

829
00:28:59,039 --> 00:29:01,120
of course leverage automation as much as

830
00:29:01,120 --> 00:29:02,080
possible

831
00:29:02,080 --> 00:29:02,880
and

832
00:29:02,880 --> 00:29:06,720
add security to the definition of done

833
00:29:06,720 --> 00:29:09,120
so a story is essentially not done until

834
00:29:09,120 --> 00:29:11,760
it's securely done

835
00:29:11,760 --> 00:29:13,600
finally

836
00:29:13,600 --> 00:29:15,840
focus on the process and pipeline to

837
00:29:15,840 --> 00:29:18,240
ensure that you can gain velocity and

838
00:29:18,240 --> 00:29:20,000
ensure coverage when you are trying your

839
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:22,159
change program

840
00:29:22,159 --> 00:29:24,399
understand that the ecosystem should be

841
00:29:24,399 --> 00:29:26,480
secure by design rather than the

842
00:29:26,480 --> 00:29:28,960
individual components in your supply

843
00:29:28,960 --> 00:29:30,559
chain

844
00:29:30,559 --> 00:29:33,760
and lastly leverage culture to add

845
00:29:33,760 --> 00:29:38,000
security to your organizational fabric

846
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:39,039
so

847
00:29:39,039 --> 00:29:40,240
there there'll be many things that you

848
00:29:40,240 --> 00:29:42,640
might do or to you know bring in smaller

849
00:29:42,640 --> 00:29:44,960
changes add controls in place

850
00:29:44,960 --> 00:29:47,279
um have automation in place from time to

851
00:29:47,279 --> 00:29:48,080
time

852
00:29:48,080 --> 00:29:51,200
but if we are driving the mindset change

853
00:29:51,200 --> 00:29:54,320
it's better to play the long game thank

854
00:29:54,320 --> 00:29:56,480
you

855
00:30:02,799 --> 00:30:04,720
that was excellent nilu and a round of

856
00:30:04,720 --> 00:30:07,360
applause for uh dealing with all the

857
00:30:07,360 --> 00:30:09,840
technical issues too there

858
00:30:09,840 --> 00:30:12,159
you handled it very smoothly so

859
00:30:12,159 --> 00:30:16,480
i know how to do it live yes

860
00:30:16,880 --> 00:30:18,880
i know how jarring that can be and you

861
00:30:18,880 --> 00:30:20,880
you handle it so professionally kneeling

862
00:30:20,880 --> 00:30:22,640
so well done on that and uh thank you

863
00:30:22,640 --> 00:30:25,039
for that excellent session so i think do

864
00:30:25,039 --> 00:30:26,880
we yeah if you have a few more minutes

865
00:30:26,880 --> 00:30:28,080
here we have a couple questions for you

866
00:30:28,080 --> 00:30:30,640
if you don't mind that sound good

867
00:30:30,640 --> 00:30:31,520
sure

868
00:30:31,520 --> 00:30:33,520
okay great all right so first question

869
00:30:33,520 --> 00:30:35,440
that came up was i believe it was

870
00:30:35,440 --> 00:30:37,919
kavitha over in hopkin thank you kavisa

871
00:30:37,919 --> 00:30:39,120
for the question

872
00:30:39,120 --> 00:30:40,799
and uh

873
00:30:40,799 --> 00:30:43,039
their question was what tools were used

874
00:30:43,039 --> 00:30:45,039
in the process journey were there any in

875
00:30:45,039 --> 00:30:46,399
particular that you could call out and

876
00:30:46,399 --> 00:30:48,480
share with folks that enabled some of

877
00:30:48,480 --> 00:30:49,840
what you learned and shared through this

878
00:30:49,840 --> 00:30:52,080
process

879
00:30:52,080 --> 00:30:54,640
so for us when we were driving the sec

880
00:30:54,640 --> 00:30:56,399
champ program particularly so we have

881
00:30:56,399 --> 00:30:58,799
other automation specific programs where

882
00:30:58,799 --> 00:31:00,480
we have tools which we recommend you

883
00:31:00,480 --> 00:31:02,480
know for adding controls because this

884
00:31:02,480 --> 00:31:04,399
was mostly a people-focused program and

885
00:31:04,399 --> 00:31:05,840
we were looking at agile threat

886
00:31:05,840 --> 00:31:08,240
modelings uh that is a framework that we

887
00:31:08,240 --> 00:31:10,720
have uh sort of created in within

888
00:31:10,720 --> 00:31:12,960
thoughtworks and that's what we used uh

889
00:31:12,960 --> 00:31:14,640
particularly for agile threat modeling

890
00:31:14,640 --> 00:31:17,279
it's based on top of microsoft stride

891
00:31:17,279 --> 00:31:19,200
model itself but a faster and much

892
00:31:19,200 --> 00:31:21,600
quicker way of doing it we did not use

893
00:31:21,600 --> 00:31:23,760
um specifically any tools there are

894
00:31:23,760 --> 00:31:25,760
tools for threat modeling as well

895
00:31:25,760 --> 00:31:28,000
but given that our organization is more

896
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:29,679
like a service based organization there

897
00:31:29,679 --> 00:31:31,840
are you know multiple clients and

898
00:31:31,840 --> 00:31:33,760
different tech stacks different

899
00:31:33,760 --> 00:31:35,039
compliance requirements you know the

900
00:31:35,039 --> 00:31:36,880
context is entirely different for all

901
00:31:36,880 --> 00:31:38,000
the clients

902
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:41,120
so uh we kept it simple and we kept it

903
00:31:41,120 --> 00:31:43,039
agile

904
00:31:43,039 --> 00:31:44,399
excellent excellent

905
00:31:44,399 --> 00:31:45,600
um

906
00:31:45,600 --> 00:31:46,960
the one thing that hit home for me and

907
00:31:46,960 --> 00:31:47,919
we have a couple more questions but

908
00:31:47,919 --> 00:31:49,120
really quick one thing that hit home for

909
00:31:49,120 --> 00:31:50,399
me was when you

910
00:31:50,399 --> 00:31:52,320
uh talked about security as part of your

911
00:31:52,320 --> 00:31:54,240
definition of done

912
00:31:54,240 --> 00:31:56,320
you like it really brought me back into

913
00:31:56,320 --> 00:31:58,080
recalling some of my earlier developer

914
00:31:58,080 --> 00:31:59,919
days where we as a team were defining

915
00:31:59,919 --> 00:32:01,760
this definition of done and we didn't

916
00:32:01,760 --> 00:32:03,679
have security included in there honestly

917
00:32:03,679 --> 00:32:05,039
speaking but we had things like testing

918
00:32:05,039 --> 00:32:08,240
and like what like deploying it in a

919
00:32:08,240 --> 00:32:09,600
staging environment to make sure it

920
00:32:09,600 --> 00:32:12,399
works there and so this that like

921
00:32:12,399 --> 00:32:14,320
thank you for sharing that part in there

922
00:32:14,320 --> 00:32:15,679
and like i'm thinking back like how did

923
00:32:15,679 --> 00:32:17,519
we not think about okay how do we

924
00:32:17,519 --> 00:32:19,760
include security in that definition of

925
00:32:19,760 --> 00:32:22,880
done too so uh that's it's just awesome

926
00:32:22,880 --> 00:32:24,080
to see and i think this can be super

927
00:32:24,080 --> 00:32:27,120
helpful to the older me as well um and

928
00:32:27,120 --> 00:32:28,480
folks that were there so one more

929
00:32:28,480 --> 00:32:30,080
question i think we'll take real quick

930
00:32:30,080 --> 00:32:32,159
and that is um

931
00:32:32,159 --> 00:32:34,000
were there separate

932
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:36,320
were separate projects created for cloud

933
00:32:36,320 --> 00:32:37,919
and on-premise applications throughout

934
00:32:37,919 --> 00:32:40,080
this

935
00:32:40,840 --> 00:32:43,919
um we will so we were essentially

936
00:32:43,919 --> 00:32:46,960
working on a security change program

937
00:32:46,960 --> 00:32:49,600
and we were not delivering any projects

938
00:32:49,600 --> 00:32:52,159
however we were dealing with uh if i

939
00:32:52,159 --> 00:32:53,600
understand your

940
00:32:53,600 --> 00:32:55,519
question correctly correct me if i'm

941
00:32:55,519 --> 00:32:57,200
wrong we were dealing with various

942
00:32:57,200 --> 00:32:59,279
projects some of them were on cloud some

943
00:32:59,279 --> 00:33:00,960
some of them were on-prem

944
00:33:00,960 --> 00:33:02,240
and

945
00:33:02,240 --> 00:33:03,919
in fact some of them were also purely

946
00:33:03,919 --> 00:33:06,080
infrastructure projects right so the

947
00:33:06,080 --> 00:33:07,760
agile threat modeling one for example

948
00:33:07,760 --> 00:33:09,600
for us it was threat modeling we were

949
00:33:09,600 --> 00:33:12,320
working on we when we talked to about

950
00:33:12,320 --> 00:33:13,760
threat modeling it would be different

951
00:33:13,760 --> 00:33:16,159
for for example specifically for

952
00:33:16,159 --> 00:33:18,240
applications or just web applications or

953
00:33:18,240 --> 00:33:20,159
mobile applications right because you

954
00:33:20,159 --> 00:33:21,519
look at different issues which are

955
00:33:21,519 --> 00:33:24,480
commonly found in mobile rather than web

956
00:33:24,480 --> 00:33:26,080
so web would be different mobile would

957
00:33:26,080 --> 00:33:27,440
be different infrastructure will be

958
00:33:27,440 --> 00:33:28,480
different because then you might

959
00:33:28,480 --> 00:33:30,000
actually do an infrastructure threat

960
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:32,480
modeling uh and also architecture review

961
00:33:32,480 --> 00:33:34,559
from that perspective so

962
00:33:34,559 --> 00:33:36,640
this context was different for us and

963
00:33:36,640 --> 00:33:38,399
with cloud we would definitely have or

964
00:33:38,399 --> 00:33:41,120
look into different scenarios for cloud

965
00:33:41,120 --> 00:33:43,039
so that was the the degree of difference

966
00:33:43,039 --> 00:33:45,519
that we were following um within that

967
00:33:45,519 --> 00:33:47,120
also there were many uh you know

968
00:33:47,120 --> 00:33:49,039
subdivisions but we didn't go that far

969
00:33:49,039 --> 00:33:50,559
we wanted to keep it simple so that

970
00:33:50,559 --> 00:33:52,480
everybody could pick up and understand

971
00:33:52,480 --> 00:33:54,559
for example if you are looking at mobile

972
00:33:54,559 --> 00:33:55,679
then

973
00:33:55,679 --> 00:33:57,519
you should go for also mobile top 10

974
00:33:57,519 --> 00:33:59,279
issues rather than just blindly looking

975
00:33:59,279 --> 00:34:01,279
at the web top 10 you know so just

976
00:34:01,279 --> 00:34:03,519
giving an example from obvious

977
00:34:03,519 --> 00:34:05,600
there are very contextual issues to look

978
00:34:05,600 --> 00:34:07,600
at and that's what we were focusing on

979
00:34:07,600 --> 00:34:09,199
during answer mode

980
00:34:09,199 --> 00:34:10,879
gotcha that makes a lot of sense and

981
00:34:10,879 --> 00:34:12,239
thank everybody that was posting some of

982
00:34:12,239 --> 00:34:13,679
the questions in there

983
00:34:13,679 --> 00:34:15,520
uh eric do we have any more questions

984
00:34:15,520 --> 00:34:18,239
maybe that are coming to mind for you or

985
00:34:18,239 --> 00:34:21,760
um yeah well simon asked one i was

986
00:34:21,760 --> 00:34:25,280
should i find it in our list

987
00:34:25,599 --> 00:34:27,359
i'm just going to ask it from the chat

988
00:34:27,359 --> 00:34:30,399
it says uh when you say iterative threat

989
00:34:30,399 --> 00:34:32,320
modeling what triggers an update to the

990
00:34:32,320 --> 00:34:34,719
threat model that was created before

991
00:34:34,719 --> 00:34:37,280
would bug fixes or minor improvements

992
00:34:37,280 --> 00:34:39,599
counts

993
00:34:39,599 --> 00:34:42,719
yeah that's a good question so uh when

994
00:34:42,719 --> 00:34:44,719
when we say i did a threat modeling it

995
00:34:44,719 --> 00:34:46,399
is to pick up a bunch of features right

996
00:34:46,399 --> 00:34:48,879
so when you start developing uh

997
00:34:48,879 --> 00:34:50,320
your services

998
00:34:50,320 --> 00:34:52,079
you would have certain features being

999
00:34:52,079 --> 00:34:54,960
added uh with every release generally it

1000
00:34:54,960 --> 00:34:56,800
will not all happen at one go like it

1001
00:34:56,800 --> 00:34:59,119
happens in waterfall so when you have a

1002
00:34:59,119 --> 00:35:01,359
bunch of features which are being added

1003
00:35:01,359 --> 00:35:03,760
uh with in every iteration or you know

1004
00:35:03,760 --> 00:35:05,119
every couple of titration you will have

1005
00:35:05,119 --> 00:35:07,119
a bunch of new features coming up we

1006
00:35:07,119 --> 00:35:09,200
would pick up a bunch of features and

1007
00:35:09,200 --> 00:35:11,200
then start whiteboarding and thread

1008
00:35:11,200 --> 00:35:13,359
modeling around it and that is what we

1009
00:35:13,359 --> 00:35:15,280
call iterative because it would be you

1010
00:35:15,280 --> 00:35:16,880
know every one or two iterations we

1011
00:35:16,880 --> 00:35:18,400
would have a threat modeling because we

1012
00:35:18,400 --> 00:35:20,400
would have new set of features that we

1013
00:35:20,400 --> 00:35:23,040
would threat model on

1014
00:35:23,040 --> 00:35:24,160
that's great

1015
00:35:24,160 --> 00:35:26,560
great way to keep things fresh um as the

1016
00:35:26,560 --> 00:35:28,480
as the application changes

1017
00:35:28,480 --> 00:35:30,000
you know one of the things that actually

1018
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:31,359
i i'm going to steal this i'm going to

1019
00:35:31,359 --> 00:35:33,359
quote you on this one i i love when you

1020
00:35:33,359 --> 00:35:34,160
said

1021
00:35:34,160 --> 00:35:36,240
uh that you need to

1022
00:35:36,240 --> 00:35:38,160
hopefully i won't butcher this to make

1023
00:35:38,160 --> 00:35:40,079
the functionality secure you need to

1024
00:35:40,079 --> 00:35:43,119
make secured security functional that is

1025
00:35:43,119 --> 00:35:45,200
like a genius quote i love that thank

1026
00:35:45,200 --> 00:35:47,680
you so much

1027
00:35:47,680 --> 00:35:49,280
yeah you realize so much of that once

1028
00:35:49,280 --> 00:35:51,200
you are on the agile side of things that

1029
00:35:51,200 --> 00:35:52,400
uh you know

1030
00:35:52,400 --> 00:35:54,320
but just to add to the previous answer i

1031
00:35:54,320 --> 00:35:55,119
think

1032
00:35:55,119 --> 00:35:56,880
just to clarify it further if you've

1033
00:35:56,880 --> 00:35:58,720
already done a threat modeling for your

1034
00:35:58,720 --> 00:36:00,560
entire application or your entire

1035
00:36:00,560 --> 00:36:02,560
service for example

1036
00:36:02,560 --> 00:36:04,160
and you are then making a change whether

1037
00:36:04,160 --> 00:36:07,040
it's a bug fix or your it's an update uh

1038
00:36:07,040 --> 00:36:08,560
you will have to look at functionally

1039
00:36:08,560 --> 00:36:10,640
what you have really added sometimes

1040
00:36:10,640 --> 00:36:13,040
minor enhancements should not we should

1041
00:36:13,040 --> 00:36:14,960
not go to that depth because then that

1042
00:36:14,960 --> 00:36:17,680
will that makes it too much uh to a

1043
00:36:17,680 --> 00:36:19,359
micro level and you may not end up

1044
00:36:19,359 --> 00:36:21,520
getting too many threads so when you're

1045
00:36:21,520 --> 00:36:23,040
looking at the roi because you're also

1046
00:36:23,040 --> 00:36:24,720
counting time of how many times you're

1047
00:36:24,720 --> 00:36:26,640
getting into a threat modeling it's good

1048
00:36:26,640 --> 00:36:28,800
to see what is if it's a major change

1049
00:36:28,800 --> 00:36:30,240
that you have done a major update that

1050
00:36:30,240 --> 00:36:32,320
you have done if you have something

1051
00:36:32,320 --> 00:36:34,000
majorly functional that has been added

1052
00:36:34,000 --> 00:36:36,079
or changed to you know go about doing

1053
00:36:36,079 --> 00:36:40,320
another threat modeling for that change

1054
00:36:40,320 --> 00:36:41,680
very cool

1055
00:36:41,680 --> 00:36:44,640
