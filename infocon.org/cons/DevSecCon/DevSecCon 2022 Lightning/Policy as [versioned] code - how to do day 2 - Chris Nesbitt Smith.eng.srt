20
00:00:43,980 --> 00:00:45,360
joining me here today

21
00:00:45,360 --> 00:00:49,379
so elephant in the room policy is a dull

22
00:00:49,379 --> 00:00:51,059
thing it's kind of hard to make it sound

23
00:00:51,059 --> 00:00:52,860
sexy but I'm gonna at least try and get

24
00:00:52,860 --> 00:00:54,600
your attention so

25
00:00:54,600 --> 00:00:57,239
bear with me so to set the scene I'm in

26
00:00:57,239 --> 00:00:58,800
a lift and yes and the American friends

27
00:00:58,800 --> 00:01:00,600
we really do call them lifts and four

28
00:01:00,600 --> 00:01:02,520
people walk in I think to myself Chris

29
00:01:02,520 --> 00:01:04,860
this is your moment Now or Never As the

30
00:01:04,860 --> 00:01:06,960
doors close I position myself in front

31
00:01:06,960 --> 00:01:08,640
of them a captive audience they're mine

32
00:01:08,640 --> 00:01:10,740
I've got them I hear the door still shut

33
00:01:10,740 --> 00:01:12,840
behind me as I take a breath

34
00:01:12,840 --> 00:01:14,400
and it's the first person on my left

35
00:01:14,400 --> 00:01:15,900
she's in a suit she looks really

36
00:01:15,900 --> 00:01:18,780
important to i gesture to her C

37
00:01:18,780 --> 00:01:20,759
she looks back at me as if to say yes go

38
00:01:20,759 --> 00:01:23,939
on I she nods ah oh perfect the CIO the

39
00:01:23,939 --> 00:01:25,680
policy maker the one whose neck is on

40
00:01:25,680 --> 00:01:26,880
the Block what are the chances of

41
00:01:26,880 --> 00:01:28,860
finding you in my imaginary lift today

42
00:01:28,860 --> 00:01:30,900
well I ask her well what keeps you up at

43
00:01:30,900 --> 00:01:32,700
night well she tells me I don't know

44
00:01:32,700 --> 00:01:34,380
what teams are really doing what the

45
00:01:34,380 --> 00:01:36,060
volume of risk and what I should be

46
00:01:36,060 --> 00:01:38,460
showing more interest in setting and

47
00:01:38,460 --> 00:01:40,439
changing the policy is slow hard to

48
00:01:40,439 --> 00:01:42,360
communicate and people just go off and

49
00:01:42,360 --> 00:01:44,100
do their own thing they think they know

50
00:01:44,100 --> 00:01:46,140
better and to be honest often they do

51
00:01:46,140 --> 00:01:47,939
but then I'm left playing catch up with

52
00:01:47,939 --> 00:01:50,460
the risk that they've signed me up to

53
00:01:50,460 --> 00:01:52,380
okay I say try not to sound like as

54
00:01:52,380 --> 00:01:54,360
patronizing stakeholders from I can't

55
00:01:54,360 --> 00:01:55,320
help

56
00:01:55,320 --> 00:01:57,060
I turn my attention to the second person

57
00:01:57,060 --> 00:01:58,979
also in a suit but look that's important

58
00:01:58,979 --> 00:02:01,200
I make a guess let's face it this is my

59
00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:02,820
imagination would be weird if I was

60
00:02:02,820 --> 00:02:04,799
wrong here product manager I say they're

61
00:02:04,799 --> 00:02:06,960
not ah the whip cracker say well what's

62
00:02:06,960 --> 00:02:10,020
important to you so managing risk mostly

63
00:02:10,020 --> 00:02:12,300
opportunity risk so the fear of missing

64
00:02:12,300 --> 00:02:14,220
out so getting features out of the door

65
00:02:14,220 --> 00:02:16,560
and avoiding getting bogged down with as

66
00:02:16,560 --> 00:02:19,319
they glance to the CIO bureaucracy that

67
00:02:19,319 --> 00:02:21,120
is almost designed to Slow Me Down

68
00:02:21,120 --> 00:02:24,660
awesome I say this is your lucky day

69
00:02:24,660 --> 00:02:26,520
I turned to the next person dressed in

70
00:02:26,520 --> 00:02:28,080
overalls I'm in a trendy part of town

71
00:02:28,080 --> 00:02:30,000
they could be the CTO but before I ask

72
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:32,459
they sense me staring at them cleaner I

73
00:02:32,459 --> 00:02:34,860
say okay how did you get into my

74
00:02:34,860 --> 00:02:37,140
imagination I'll come back to you my

75
00:02:37,140 --> 00:02:38,760
attention goes to the last person hoodie

76
00:02:38,760 --> 00:02:40,440
headphones around their neck ah my

77
00:02:40,440 --> 00:02:42,959
stereotypical developer yes I know you

78
00:02:42,959 --> 00:02:45,360
well what code do you write ask it

79
00:02:45,360 --> 00:02:46,980
doesn't really matter but python have

80
00:02:46,980 --> 00:02:48,540
you got everything updated to work with

81
00:02:48,540 --> 00:02:52,260
as I pause Python 3 they say ah Python 3

82
00:02:52,260 --> 00:02:54,300
yeah that must be really hard they don't

83
00:02:54,300 --> 00:02:55,920
know it but I've kind of informally want

84
00:02:55,920 --> 00:02:57,300
a bit of their trust which is after all

85
00:02:57,300 --> 00:02:59,819
important nearly they say cool okay well

86
00:02:59,819 --> 00:03:01,800
what's important to you

87
00:03:01,800 --> 00:03:03,540
so staying on top of patching

88
00:03:03,540 --> 00:03:05,160
dependencies so that we can react to the

89
00:03:05,160 --> 00:03:07,860
next fire knowing what rules exist what

90
00:03:07,860 --> 00:03:09,900
ones I can bend and what I could break

91
00:03:09,900 --> 00:03:11,519
and what ultimately might cause me to

92
00:03:11,519 --> 00:03:13,019
lose my job

93
00:03:13,019 --> 00:03:15,780
writing consistent good quality code and

94
00:03:15,780 --> 00:03:17,459
avoiding technical debt so the rest of

95
00:03:17,459 --> 00:03:20,340
my team been able to cohesively work as

96
00:03:20,340 --> 00:03:22,379
one do you use any tools to help you

97
00:03:22,379 --> 00:03:24,360
with that I ask well yeah linta's code

98
00:03:24,360 --> 00:03:26,879
quality test coverage that's unusual

99
00:03:26,879 --> 00:03:28,920
great I say I write code two let's be

100
00:03:28,920 --> 00:03:30,659
friends and I hand them a printed QR

101
00:03:30,659 --> 00:03:33,120
code and say Here's my public gpg key so

102
00:03:33,120 --> 00:03:34,440
you know that you can trust what I have

103
00:03:34,440 --> 00:03:35,459
to say

104
00:03:35,459 --> 00:03:37,440
I return my focus to the cleaner I've

105
00:03:37,440 --> 00:03:39,120
got it how do you get told what to do

106
00:03:39,120 --> 00:03:41,700
and then when it changes well we get a

107
00:03:41,700 --> 00:03:43,379
memo or something stuck to the notice

108
00:03:43,379 --> 00:03:45,299
board so last week we got a memo saying

109
00:03:45,299 --> 00:03:46,739
that all the meeting room whiteboards

110
00:03:46,739 --> 00:03:48,319
needed to be cleaned every night

111
00:03:48,319 --> 00:03:50,760
interesting I say how does that work out

112
00:03:50,760 --> 00:03:52,799
well it's up to us to then maintain the

113
00:03:52,799 --> 00:03:54,659
to-do list so that we can onboard new

114
00:03:54,659 --> 00:03:55,560
people

115
00:03:55,560 --> 00:03:57,239
does it go wrong at all well yeah

116
00:03:57,239 --> 00:03:59,159
sometimes if we compile our operational

117
00:03:59,159 --> 00:04:01,680
manual wrong we miss or we miss a memo

118
00:04:01,680 --> 00:04:03,599
don't apply them in sequence we do get

119
00:04:03,599 --> 00:04:06,120
things wrong so glance apologetically to

120
00:04:06,120 --> 00:04:07,620
the product manager like when we haven't

121
00:04:07,620 --> 00:04:09,480
updated the guide at the meeting room on

122
00:04:09,480 --> 00:04:10,980
the third floor was being used as a

123
00:04:10,980 --> 00:04:13,080
dedicated war room and we wiped all

124
00:04:13,080 --> 00:04:14,640
their boards down

125
00:04:14,640 --> 00:04:16,380
I look to the dev does that sound

126
00:04:16,380 --> 00:04:18,660
familiar they nod ah turns out we're not

127
00:04:18,660 --> 00:04:20,639
all special snowflakes say ah all is not

128
00:04:20,639 --> 00:04:22,199
lost I knew that there was a reason that

129
00:04:22,199 --> 00:04:23,639
I imagined you here

130
00:04:23,639 --> 00:04:25,560
the lift is slowing I feel it coming to

131
00:04:25,560 --> 00:04:27,419
its destination great I've got a silver

132
00:04:27,419 --> 00:04:28,800
bullet for you too

133
00:04:28,800 --> 00:04:30,900
the CIO looks to me ready to buy

134
00:04:30,900 --> 00:04:32,520
literally whatever it is I'm selling

135
00:04:32,520 --> 00:04:34,259
they ask me is the doors open who are

136
00:04:34,259 --> 00:04:36,540
you and what team are you in has any

137
00:04:36,540 --> 00:04:38,520
move out the way to stop obstructing my

138
00:04:38,520 --> 00:04:40,199
answer well I don't actually work here

139
00:04:40,199 --> 00:04:42,060
I'm just here to fix the lift people

140
00:04:42,060 --> 00:04:43,440
have been complaining it only goes to

141
00:04:43,440 --> 00:04:45,000
the top floor no matter what button they

142
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:47,160
push and it's actually pretty slow

143
00:04:47,160 --> 00:04:49,860
my audience storms out Furious heading

144
00:04:49,860 --> 00:04:52,080
towards the stairs the door's shut I get

145
00:04:52,080 --> 00:04:53,580
back to my job

146
00:04:53,580 --> 00:04:55,500
okay so if any of this might sound

147
00:04:55,500 --> 00:04:57,540
Vaguely Familiar to you then and you can

148
00:04:57,540 --> 00:04:59,160
relate to some of my imaginary friends

149
00:04:59,160 --> 00:05:00,240
then

150
00:05:00,240 --> 00:05:03,419
I've got answers for you so what if I

151
00:05:03,419 --> 00:05:04,320
said

152
00:05:04,320 --> 00:05:06,300
you could update policy easily even

153
00:05:06,300 --> 00:05:08,520
releasing several version updates not

154
00:05:08,520 --> 00:05:11,340
just in a year a month what about 10

155
00:05:11,340 --> 00:05:13,560
updates in a single day and seamlessly

156
00:05:13,560 --> 00:05:15,300
communicate those to the people who need

157
00:05:15,300 --> 00:05:17,880
to consume it all without derailing them

158
00:05:17,880 --> 00:05:19,800
you could have visibility on compliance

159
00:05:19,800 --> 00:05:21,840
using tools that you perhaps already use

160
00:05:21,840 --> 00:05:24,120
and that the policy can be readily

161
00:05:24,120 --> 00:05:26,340
consumable easy to pass demonstrate

162
00:05:26,340 --> 00:05:28,139
compliance and make sense not be

163
00:05:28,139 --> 00:05:29,820
bureaucratic to change when it needs to

164
00:05:29,820 --> 00:05:31,860
and ultimately not get in the way

165
00:05:31,860 --> 00:05:33,840
that same policy could be treated as a

166
00:05:33,840 --> 00:05:36,419
dependency and operate like a linter so

167
00:05:36,419 --> 00:05:38,160
you can run compliance checks locally

168
00:05:38,160 --> 00:05:40,800
and in CI and then onwards kind of guard

169
00:05:40,800 --> 00:05:42,060
production

170
00:05:42,060 --> 00:05:44,639
multiple versions of a policy like a

171
00:05:44,639 --> 00:05:46,800
dependency are supportive so emergencies

172
00:05:46,800 --> 00:05:48,539
like you must update now because there's

173
00:05:48,539 --> 00:05:50,100
now some known vulnerability type

174
00:05:50,100 --> 00:05:52,620
updates become a business as usual

175
00:05:52,620 --> 00:05:54,360
activity in order to communicate to your

176
00:05:54,360 --> 00:05:56,639
to those that needs to know

177
00:05:56,639 --> 00:06:00,060
sound interesting okay hang around

178
00:06:00,060 --> 00:06:01,380
so

179
00:06:01,380 --> 00:06:02,940
I've hopefully at least got some of your

180
00:06:02,940 --> 00:06:04,199
attention that's trying to introduce

181
00:06:04,199 --> 00:06:06,000
myself and start explaining things so my

182
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:07,800
name is Chris Nesbitt Smith I'm

183
00:06:07,800 --> 00:06:09,479
currently an instructor for learnkates

184
00:06:09,479 --> 00:06:11,639
and also control plane uh consultant

185
00:06:11,639 --> 00:06:13,320
currently to the crown prosecution

186
00:06:13,320 --> 00:06:16,380
service and a tinkerer of Open Source

187
00:06:16,380 --> 00:06:18,300
stuff in this sort of space I spent a

188
00:06:18,300 --> 00:06:20,340
fair chunk of my professional career now

189
00:06:20,340 --> 00:06:22,860
working in UK government and large

190
00:06:22,860 --> 00:06:24,660
organizations where problems like these

191
00:06:24,660 --> 00:06:27,240
are Rife we should hopefully have some

192
00:06:27,240 --> 00:06:29,100
time at the end for questions if not you

193
00:06:29,100 --> 00:06:30,360
can probably find me on on LinkedIn

194
00:06:30,360 --> 00:06:32,039
somewhere

195
00:06:32,039 --> 00:06:35,039
so given I've got the the luxury of a

196
00:06:35,039 --> 00:06:36,419
live audience

197
00:06:36,419 --> 00:06:40,319
um albeits away somewhere

198
00:06:40,319 --> 00:06:43,199
um I wonder if you could uh put in the

199
00:06:43,199 --> 00:06:45,240
comments uh that

200
00:06:45,240 --> 00:06:45,900
um

201
00:06:45,900 --> 00:06:49,500
who's with my CIO and has uh set written

202
00:06:49,500 --> 00:06:51,360
or applied some policy before so just

203
00:06:51,360 --> 00:06:52,560
leave a comment and say that you're a

204
00:06:52,560 --> 00:06:55,440
policy maker if you've set or reply or

205
00:06:55,440 --> 00:06:57,720
replied any sort of policy before so if

206
00:06:57,720 --> 00:07:01,259
that is uh like let's say in some coding

207
00:07:01,259 --> 00:07:04,020
standards for your team or saying that I

208
00:07:04,020 --> 00:07:05,699
don't know if something needs to be

209
00:07:05,699 --> 00:07:07,380
encrypted or whatever it might be any

210
00:07:07,380 --> 00:07:09,660
sort of policy that you defined if you

211
00:07:09,660 --> 00:07:11,340
just leave a comment of saying that

212
00:07:11,340 --> 00:07:14,359
you're a policy maker

213
00:07:14,400 --> 00:07:16,979
cool I'll crap catch up on what whatever

214
00:07:16,979 --> 00:07:19,440
everyone's at like in a bit okay so you

215
00:07:19,440 --> 00:07:20,819
can next round

216
00:07:20,819 --> 00:07:21,960
so

217
00:07:21,960 --> 00:07:24,960
now if you've sought exempt uh sort

218
00:07:24,960 --> 00:07:27,020
exemption or consciously bent broken

219
00:07:27,020 --> 00:07:30,900
circumvented ignored bypass whatever a

220
00:07:30,900 --> 00:07:33,120
policy with at least some good

221
00:07:33,120 --> 00:07:34,979
intentions could you write leave a

222
00:07:34,979 --> 00:07:38,300
comment of policy breaker

223
00:07:38,759 --> 00:07:40,440
just leave a comment the policy breaker

224
00:07:40,440 --> 00:07:42,960
so I can kind of get a feel for the sort

225
00:07:42,960 --> 00:07:44,699
of divide in the room

226
00:07:44,699 --> 00:07:47,180
foreign

227
00:07:48,240 --> 00:07:50,639
cool okay well if you have you fell for

228
00:07:50,639 --> 00:07:51,419
it

229
00:07:51,419 --> 00:07:53,280
um thanks to the organizers of this

230
00:07:53,280 --> 00:07:54,900
event we've all we've got all your names

231
00:07:54,900 --> 00:07:57,720
uh and your and your and your employer's

232
00:07:57,720 --> 00:08:00,240
details all recorded so lend me your

233
00:08:00,240 --> 00:08:02,940
ears the the stakes just got raised so

234
00:08:02,940 --> 00:08:05,639
where do I see policy as code going

235
00:08:05,639 --> 00:08:07,800
wrong well before we dig into that what

236
00:08:07,800 --> 00:08:10,560
do I mean by policy so it usually comes

237
00:08:10,560 --> 00:08:13,139
in one of two forms so security

238
00:08:13,139 --> 00:08:15,000
enforcing like data at rest being

239
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:17,580
encrypted or consistency enforcing such

240
00:08:17,580 --> 00:08:19,919
as code stuff so tabs two or four space

241
00:08:19,919 --> 00:08:21,720
indentator Maybe

242
00:08:21,720 --> 00:08:23,340
or maybe you can think of some others

243
00:08:23,340 --> 00:08:25,080
but in any case it's hopefully intended

244
00:08:25,080 --> 00:08:27,780
to mitigate a risk of some sort

245
00:08:27,780 --> 00:08:29,400
however with the best of intentions

246
00:08:29,400 --> 00:08:31,740
these are often emotionally LED rather

247
00:08:31,740 --> 00:08:33,899
than being grounded in proportionate

248
00:08:33,899 --> 00:08:36,659
control which there it becomes the open

249
00:08:36,659 --> 00:08:38,940
doors boo case-by-case exemptions being

250
00:08:38,940 --> 00:08:40,740
required when you come against up

251
00:08:40,740 --> 00:08:43,500
situations that you weren't anticipating

252
00:08:43,500 --> 00:08:45,779
so this is not unlike the how the laws

253
00:08:45,779 --> 00:08:47,640
of the land are created with case law

254
00:08:47,640 --> 00:08:50,160
making for a complex to navigate rule

255
00:08:50,160 --> 00:08:51,779
book and then harder still to measure

256
00:08:51,779 --> 00:08:52,860
compliance

257
00:08:52,860 --> 00:08:54,959
it often can look like the thin bit of a

258
00:08:54,959 --> 00:08:56,820
wedge where the precedent may have been

259
00:08:56,820 --> 00:08:58,260
an uncomfortable pill to swallow the

260
00:08:58,260 --> 00:09:00,420
first time around becomes dangerous with

261
00:09:00,420 --> 00:09:02,700
others looking to expand upon its scope

262
00:09:02,700 --> 00:09:04,200
which can lead us to then sometimes

263
00:09:04,200 --> 00:09:06,060
wonder if the Cure was actually worse

264
00:09:06,060 --> 00:09:07,440
than the disease

265
00:09:07,440 --> 00:09:09,300
but that's not at least how we typically

266
00:09:09,300 --> 00:09:11,399
develop software so why does this all

267
00:09:11,399 --> 00:09:13,560
have to be so hard surely there must be

268
00:09:13,560 --> 00:09:15,240
a better answer

269
00:09:15,240 --> 00:09:17,100
well we codified everything else so

270
00:09:17,100 --> 00:09:19,980
isn't that the answer well yes in part

271
00:09:19,980 --> 00:09:21,720
but my point of this talk is that we

272
00:09:21,720 --> 00:09:23,760
typically do it wrong

273
00:09:23,760 --> 00:09:26,279
so maybe some of you are screaming your

274
00:09:26,279 --> 00:09:27,720
favorite product name at me and your

275
00:09:27,720 --> 00:09:29,640
heads as the solution and I don't think

276
00:09:29,640 --> 00:09:31,560
you're wholly wrong

277
00:09:31,560 --> 00:09:34,500
however the devil's in the detail

278
00:09:34,500 --> 00:09:36,720
throwing some curly braces or yeah well

279
00:09:36,720 --> 00:09:39,240
something doesn't actually inherently

280
00:09:39,240 --> 00:09:40,920
fix things

281
00:09:40,920 --> 00:09:43,440
so if it's a security control it's often

282
00:09:43,440 --> 00:09:45,240
tempting to just keep that policy a

283
00:09:45,240 --> 00:09:47,220
secret exposing it could be used against

284
00:09:47,220 --> 00:09:49,019
you by an adversary

285
00:09:49,019 --> 00:09:50,820
however that does not support us in

286
00:09:50,820 --> 00:09:52,860
shifting left it results in dev's

287
00:09:52,860 --> 00:09:54,300
effects of really reverse engineering

288
00:09:54,300 --> 00:09:56,640
what the policy is by finding out when

289
00:09:56,640 --> 00:09:58,860
we smash our heads up against them

290
00:09:58,860 --> 00:10:00,240
therefore it doesn't take much

291
00:10:00,240 --> 00:10:02,640
imagination to see in the scenario of an

292
00:10:02,640 --> 00:10:04,320
application deploy Midway through

293
00:10:04,320 --> 00:10:06,300
finding one resource is non-compliant

294
00:10:06,300 --> 00:10:08,220
and rejected could leave the overall

295
00:10:08,220 --> 00:10:10,320
deploy in an inconsistent halfway State

296
00:10:10,320 --> 00:10:13,500
likely resulting in some downtime

297
00:10:13,500 --> 00:10:15,120
which begs the question of was that

298
00:10:15,120 --> 00:10:17,160
policy better than the downtime

299
00:10:17,160 --> 00:10:19,140
especially if it leads your engineers

300
00:10:19,140 --> 00:10:21,240
who are all hopefully plenty smart

301
00:10:21,240 --> 00:10:23,880
people finding inventive should we say

302
00:10:23,880 --> 00:10:26,399
ways around the computer says no

303
00:10:26,399 --> 00:10:28,740
response that they've got

304
00:10:28,740 --> 00:10:30,600
this is then becomes further exasperated

305
00:10:30,600 --> 00:10:32,339
when updates the policy designed so

306
00:10:32,339 --> 00:10:33,959
maybe you've got a pen test or something

307
00:10:33,959 --> 00:10:36,839
goes wrong so you form that case law and

308
00:10:36,839 --> 00:10:39,540
you need to apply a new policy so maybe

309
00:10:39,540 --> 00:10:41,640
all S3 buckets now need to be encrypted

310
00:10:41,640 --> 00:10:43,800
a change that could be considered a

311
00:10:43,800 --> 00:10:45,180
breaking one

312
00:10:45,180 --> 00:10:46,800
sure you might say that you provide

313
00:10:46,800 --> 00:10:48,540
warnings on at least the less important

314
00:10:48,540 --> 00:10:52,380
or new emerging policy which is great

315
00:10:52,380 --> 00:10:55,200
so long as someone sees them

316
00:10:55,200 --> 00:10:57,660
so but if you adopted githubs or at

317
00:10:57,660 --> 00:11:00,300
least CI CD is anyone actually seeing

318
00:11:00,300 --> 00:11:02,220
those warnings I mean who studies the

319
00:11:02,220 --> 00:11:04,260
results of a successful build log every

320
00:11:04,260 --> 00:11:06,060
time

321
00:11:06,060 --> 00:11:07,380
anyone

322
00:11:07,380 --> 00:11:09,000
every time

323
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:11,160
well if you are I'd politely suggest

324
00:11:11,160 --> 00:11:12,420
that you're probably missing the point

325
00:11:12,420 --> 00:11:14,519
of cicd you should be able to trust your

326
00:11:14,519 --> 00:11:16,380
job status

327
00:11:16,380 --> 00:11:18,420
okay well I'm not here just to throw

328
00:11:18,420 --> 00:11:21,000
stones today so if we remember my

329
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:22,620
implied promises to my four imaginary

330
00:11:22,620 --> 00:11:24,600
friends of what this future kind of

331
00:11:24,600 --> 00:11:26,640
Promised Land might look like

332
00:11:26,640 --> 00:11:28,560
well there's nothing new Under the Sun

333
00:11:28,560 --> 00:11:30,300
we've actually already unwittingly sold

334
00:11:30,300 --> 00:11:31,620
most if not all of these problems

335
00:11:31,620 --> 00:11:33,300
elsewhere we just need to be reminded

336
00:11:33,300 --> 00:11:35,100
and then join the dots

337
00:11:35,100 --> 00:11:36,839
so well the first is something that if

338
00:11:36,839 --> 00:11:38,160
you're doing policy as code you're

339
00:11:38,160 --> 00:11:40,320
probably already doing so put it in

340
00:11:40,320 --> 00:11:42,300
Version Control the thing you might not

341
00:11:42,300 --> 00:11:44,040
be doing however is they're making that

342
00:11:44,040 --> 00:11:45,899
visible

343
00:11:45,899 --> 00:11:48,660
so at least in a saucet by which I mean

344
00:11:48,660 --> 00:11:51,180
allow your Walled Garden of employees

345
00:11:51,180 --> 00:11:52,980
suppliers Etc to be able to see the

346
00:11:52,980 --> 00:11:55,320
policy I'm not saying give away all your

347
00:11:55,320 --> 00:11:57,240
threat monitoring then tell away you can

348
00:11:57,240 --> 00:11:58,920
probably keep all that to yourself but

349
00:11:58,920 --> 00:12:00,839
I'd argue that the visible policy and

350
00:12:00,839 --> 00:12:02,940
the gaps they're in is often better than

351
00:12:02,940 --> 00:12:04,800
the downtime and reverse engineered

352
00:12:04,800 --> 00:12:07,079
workarounds and opaque Legacy exemption

353
00:12:07,079 --> 00:12:09,540
spaghetti soup

354
00:12:09,540 --> 00:12:11,279
so if you're brave you might even open

355
00:12:11,279 --> 00:12:12,899
source it you'll find that it unlocks

356
00:12:12,899 --> 00:12:14,399
and abilities work well with prospective

357
00:12:14,399 --> 00:12:16,440
suppliers without ndas and whatnot and

358
00:12:16,440 --> 00:12:19,079
widely distributed secrets are expensive

359
00:12:19,079 --> 00:12:21,240
to maintain difficult to handle and then

360
00:12:21,240 --> 00:12:23,820
often only stay secret for so long after

361
00:12:23,820 --> 00:12:25,320
all

362
00:12:25,320 --> 00:12:26,880
okay so we're often we could start our

363
00:12:26,880 --> 00:12:28,560
policy is visible now to those that need

364
00:12:28,560 --> 00:12:29,640
to see it

365
00:12:29,640 --> 00:12:32,579
so many of you and no doubt you've used

366
00:12:32,579 --> 00:12:34,500
a semantic version but a quick recap in

367
00:12:34,500 --> 00:12:37,260
the context of this so the first segment

368
00:12:37,260 --> 00:12:38,519
is to indicate breaking perhaps

369
00:12:38,519 --> 00:12:40,620
conflicting changes in the context of

370
00:12:40,620 --> 00:12:42,120
policy let's say it's requiring

371
00:12:42,120 --> 00:12:43,920
resources to have a department label

372
00:12:43,920 --> 00:12:45,660
maybe that will help with some internal

373
00:12:45,660 --> 00:12:47,100
cross charging who knows I'm not really

374
00:12:47,100 --> 00:12:48,180
judging

375
00:12:48,180 --> 00:12:50,160
and increments of that might look like

376
00:12:50,160 --> 00:12:51,420
requiring that to be from a

377
00:12:51,420 --> 00:12:53,220
predetermined list rather than just free

378
00:12:53,220 --> 00:12:54,120
text

379
00:12:54,120 --> 00:12:56,760
the second segment is to indicate minor

380
00:12:56,760 --> 00:12:59,519
changes so these shouldn't break anyone

381
00:12:59,519 --> 00:13:00,899
and increments that might look like

382
00:13:00,899 --> 00:13:02,339
correcting a spelling mistake on the

383
00:13:02,339 --> 00:13:03,600
department name

384
00:13:03,600 --> 00:13:05,700
the third segment is to indicate patch

385
00:13:05,700 --> 00:13:07,500
changes so these should be a no-brainer

386
00:13:07,500 --> 00:13:09,779
for anyone to keep up to date with

387
00:13:09,779 --> 00:13:11,100
an increments that might look like

388
00:13:11,100 --> 00:13:12,540
adding a department to the available

389
00:13:12,540 --> 00:13:13,920
options

390
00:13:13,920 --> 00:13:15,839
okay so our policy is visible in a

391
00:13:15,839 --> 00:13:17,339
really poets version we can easily

392
00:13:17,339 --> 00:13:19,139
communicate the policy we can tack on

393
00:13:19,139 --> 00:13:21,480
release notes and expectations are all

394
00:13:21,480 --> 00:13:23,940
being managed by semantic versioning

395
00:13:23,940 --> 00:13:25,740
in software we're used to handling

396
00:13:25,740 --> 00:13:27,959
dependencies so what if your policy was

397
00:13:27,959 --> 00:13:30,540
just yet another dependency

398
00:13:30,540 --> 00:13:32,160
you might unwittingly already be doing

399
00:13:32,160 --> 00:13:33,959
this if for example you have say eslint

400
00:13:33,959 --> 00:13:35,519
as a dependency in your JavaScript

401
00:13:35,519 --> 00:13:37,260
package perhaps

402
00:13:37,260 --> 00:13:39,180
okay so it's visible in a reposed

403
00:13:39,180 --> 00:13:40,560
version we can easily communicate it and

404
00:13:40,560 --> 00:13:42,060
tackle and raise those expectations are

405
00:13:42,060 --> 00:13:44,279
all set by a semba it's beginning to

406
00:13:44,279 --> 00:13:46,920
look a lot more like software

407
00:13:46,920 --> 00:13:50,339
okay I know testing is a dirty word but

408
00:13:50,339 --> 00:13:52,200
in order to make this an asset that

409
00:13:52,200 --> 00:13:54,839
everyone can depend upon it's also and

410
00:13:54,839 --> 00:13:57,360
also provide known good examples tests

411
00:13:57,360 --> 00:13:59,220
are essential to give everyone

412
00:13:59,220 --> 00:14:01,320
confidence and the stability and surface

413
00:14:01,320 --> 00:14:03,300
potential side effects before they could

414
00:14:03,300 --> 00:14:05,700
then hurt everyone involved

415
00:14:05,700 --> 00:14:07,920
so consumers of this policy can then

416
00:14:07,920 --> 00:14:10,079
test themselves against it against their

417
00:14:10,079 --> 00:14:11,940
policy locally and then an exceed on the

418
00:14:11,940 --> 00:14:13,139
CD

419
00:14:13,139 --> 00:14:15,540
thus shortening the feedback and better

420
00:14:15,540 --> 00:14:17,040
informing them

421
00:14:17,040 --> 00:14:18,839
so as a bonus we should be able to find

422
00:14:18,839 --> 00:14:20,579
our consumers able to rely on the

423
00:14:20,579 --> 00:14:23,399
artifact that we're sharing with them

424
00:14:23,399 --> 00:14:24,779
well we're well and truly on the home

425
00:14:24,779 --> 00:14:26,639
stretch it's a dependency so updating it

426
00:14:26,639 --> 00:14:28,560
should be no different to any other

427
00:14:28,560 --> 00:14:30,060
we could even use some magic like

428
00:14:30,060 --> 00:14:32,279
githubs Dependable or men's renovate to

429
00:14:32,279 --> 00:14:34,320
do this for us so think automatic pull

430
00:14:34,320 --> 00:14:36,899
requests tests even also merging if you

431
00:14:36,899 --> 00:14:38,160
like

432
00:14:38,160 --> 00:14:40,440
okay so to check everyone is all still

433
00:14:40,440 --> 00:14:42,540
awake can anyone leave me a comment and

434
00:14:42,540 --> 00:14:44,160
tell me a recent event that caused

435
00:14:44,160 --> 00:14:46,320
people to want to know what version of a

436
00:14:46,320 --> 00:14:49,019
certain logging Java doohickey you were

437
00:14:49,019 --> 00:14:51,600
potentially running literally everywhere

438
00:14:51,600 --> 00:14:54,260
in the estate

439
00:14:59,699 --> 00:15:01,380
as you know all presentations this year

440
00:15:01,380 --> 00:15:03,540
are contractually required to reference

441
00:15:03,540 --> 00:15:05,459
log 4J

442
00:15:05,459 --> 00:15:07,980
even when it's almost entirely out of

443
00:15:07,980 --> 00:15:10,500
context and includes some memes so in

444
00:15:10,500 --> 00:15:12,300
just a few short months I can remove

445
00:15:12,300 --> 00:15:15,060
these and hopefully just point broadly

446
00:15:15,060 --> 00:15:17,760
at a list of scary looking CVS in order

447
00:15:17,760 --> 00:15:19,980
to command your behavior through fear

448
00:15:19,980 --> 00:15:21,600
what I'm getting at here though is the

449
00:15:21,600 --> 00:15:23,639
situational awareness piece around the

450
00:15:23,639 --> 00:15:25,260
software supply chain is something that

451
00:15:25,260 --> 00:15:27,959
your organization is hopefully already

452
00:15:27,959 --> 00:15:30,000
thinking about if not already addressing

453
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:32,820
so if our policy is a dependency this is

454
00:15:32,820 --> 00:15:35,399
at least not a new problem so software

455
00:15:35,399 --> 00:15:38,040
bill of materials for the win right

456
00:15:38,040 --> 00:15:40,260
which can then lead us to allow us to

457
00:15:40,260 --> 00:15:42,720
measure the compliance across the estate

458
00:15:42,720 --> 00:15:44,100
okay so I've just covered a lot of

459
00:15:44,100 --> 00:15:45,779
ground and hopefully sounded like a

460
00:15:45,779 --> 00:15:48,000
little convincing and this is not just a

461
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:50,880
fictional Utopia painted in Powerpoint

462
00:15:50,880 --> 00:15:52,680
it's time to look at hgo how you might

463
00:15:52,680 --> 00:15:55,260
be able to do this and I know you all

464
00:15:55,260 --> 00:15:56,760
really came here wanting to see a

465
00:15:56,760 --> 00:15:58,440
million words on a slide and not just

466
00:15:58,440 --> 00:16:00,779
the odd Emoji or two so we've reached

467
00:16:00,779 --> 00:16:01,920
the point where I get to show you some

468
00:16:01,920 --> 00:16:04,620
code hooray but to maintain scope I'm

469
00:16:04,620 --> 00:16:06,300
going to be talking about two things to

470
00:16:06,300 --> 00:16:08,040
prove that it's not just one Tech or one

471
00:16:08,040 --> 00:16:10,320
tool so I've arbitrarily picked

472
00:16:10,320 --> 00:16:12,959
terraform and kubernetes but I could

473
00:16:12,959 --> 00:16:14,820
have probably picked anything naturally

474
00:16:14,820 --> 00:16:16,079
I'll need some tools to go along with

475
00:16:16,079 --> 00:16:18,000
this I'm too lazy to really invent much

476
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:20,279
here so I likewise I'm going to pick two

477
00:16:20,279 --> 00:16:22,680
two tools but again I could use any sum

478
00:16:22,680 --> 00:16:24,660
or even all so check Curve will be doing

479
00:16:24,660 --> 00:16:26,339
my terraform and caverno will be doing

480
00:16:26,339 --> 00:16:28,019
my kubernetes

481
00:16:28,019 --> 00:16:29,760
if you want to browse along with me I've

482
00:16:29,760 --> 00:16:31,620
created an example GitHub organization

483
00:16:31,620 --> 00:16:33,660
here I'm not expecting necessarily to

484
00:16:33,660 --> 00:16:36,000
read or grok the code on screen don't

485
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:37,380
worry about it too much it's just to

486
00:16:37,380 --> 00:16:39,720
prove that it's a real thing

487
00:16:39,720 --> 00:16:41,639
so the policy is stored here in this

488
00:16:41,639 --> 00:16:43,019
repo

489
00:16:43,019 --> 00:16:44,959
so here's where my policy starts at

490
00:16:44,959 --> 00:16:48,480
v1.00 so I've got policy that requires a

491
00:16:48,480 --> 00:16:50,220
department label on all resources so

492
00:16:50,220 --> 00:16:52,079
long as it's set doesn't actually matter

493
00:16:52,079 --> 00:16:53,220
what it is

494
00:16:53,220 --> 00:16:54,839
I've written tests for this so note how

495
00:16:54,839 --> 00:16:56,639
the passing test cases are useful as a

496
00:16:56,639 --> 00:16:58,500
great example about what a bad looks

497
00:16:58,500 --> 00:16:59,880
like

498
00:16:59,880 --> 00:17:02,339
we push the attack and get we've added

499
00:17:02,339 --> 00:17:04,260
release notes I can sign it to provide

500
00:17:04,260 --> 00:17:06,240
further Assurance if my heart so desires

501
00:17:06,240 --> 00:17:09,359
which of course it does but moving on

502
00:17:09,359 --> 00:17:11,520
version two looks similar only now that

503
00:17:11,520 --> 00:17:12,900
department field has to be from a

504
00:17:12,900 --> 00:17:14,880
predetermined list so like before tests

505
00:17:14,880 --> 00:17:16,619
exists release notes written tags are

506
00:17:16,619 --> 00:17:17,579
signed

507
00:17:17,579 --> 00:17:19,619
two one zero is where we notice and

508
00:17:19,619 --> 00:17:21,359
correct a spelling mistake of one of the

509
00:17:21,359 --> 00:17:23,579
options in the list of departments two

510
00:17:23,579 --> 00:17:25,919
one one and I've now updated now to the

511
00:17:25,919 --> 00:17:28,020
new Department to the list

512
00:17:28,020 --> 00:17:30,179
app one so a few more repos in that

513
00:17:30,179 --> 00:17:31,799
organization so app one and infra one

514
00:17:31,799 --> 00:17:33,840
well they depend on version 1.0 of the

515
00:17:33,840 --> 00:17:35,880
policy and it's not compliant with

516
00:17:35,880 --> 00:17:38,820
version two or Beyond but how do I know

517
00:17:38,820 --> 00:17:39,660
this

518
00:17:39,660 --> 00:17:41,640
so I configured renovate in this case to

519
00:17:41,640 --> 00:17:43,200
be automatically make me a pull request

520
00:17:43,200 --> 00:17:45,120
and when there's a new version of the

521
00:17:45,120 --> 00:17:47,100
policy it's so it's super obvious so if

522
00:17:47,100 --> 00:17:49,380
I can update my dependency and I can

523
00:17:49,380 --> 00:17:51,660
also see clear feedback about where and

524
00:17:51,660 --> 00:17:53,940
why I'm not compliant

525
00:17:53,940 --> 00:17:55,679
I can also see all the pull requests

526
00:17:55,679 --> 00:17:57,360
over the org so I could use this to

527
00:17:57,360 --> 00:18:00,299
measure compliance of my policy

528
00:18:00,299 --> 00:18:02,580
okay moving on so app two a couple more

529
00:18:02,580 --> 00:18:04,020
repos absolute infra team will they

530
00:18:04,020 --> 00:18:07,440
depend on version 2.00 of the policy but

531
00:18:07,440 --> 00:18:11,580
however I could merge the open excuse me

532
00:18:11,580 --> 00:18:13,380
the open pull request all the way up to

533
00:18:13,380 --> 00:18:15,980
2-1-1

534
00:18:17,760 --> 00:18:20,580
cold finally app free and MP3 are

535
00:18:20,580 --> 00:18:22,200
dependent on t11 and they get a gold

536
00:18:22,200 --> 00:18:23,940
star from the CIO

537
00:18:23,940 --> 00:18:26,700
okay there is a small Touch of Magic to

538
00:18:26,700 --> 00:18:29,700
this and it's not pretty

539
00:18:29,700 --> 00:18:32,520
I've written some Bash

540
00:18:32,520 --> 00:18:34,260
don't judge me even though I probably

541
00:18:34,260 --> 00:18:36,960
will have definitely written worse

542
00:18:36,960 --> 00:18:38,820
so what this does is allows me for my

543
00:18:38,820 --> 00:18:41,580
Dev laptop or in CI to evaluate my code

544
00:18:41,580 --> 00:18:43,020
against the version of the policy so

545
00:18:43,020 --> 00:18:45,360
ideally this might be less Council but

546
00:18:45,360 --> 00:18:47,039
it is what it is for now pull requests

547
00:18:47,039 --> 00:18:49,200
are all very welcome

548
00:18:49,200 --> 00:18:51,000
and the last piece of the puzzle is

549
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:52,679
managing the life cycle of the policies

550
00:18:52,679 --> 00:18:54,480
and allowing multiple versions of the

551
00:18:54,480 --> 00:18:56,460
policy to be accepted and evaluated

552
00:18:56,460 --> 00:18:58,620
within a single runtime

553
00:18:58,620 --> 00:19:00,780
I cheated a bit here kubernetes gives

554
00:19:00,780 --> 00:19:02,700
you admission controllers so it's not so

555
00:19:02,700 --> 00:19:04,799
easy to get the same policy evaluation

556
00:19:04,799 --> 00:19:07,020
in Cloud they've got their own kind of

557
00:19:07,020 --> 00:19:09,780
policy code and execution environments

558
00:19:09,780 --> 00:19:11,940
I've not figured out how to evaluate

559
00:19:11,940 --> 00:19:14,400
that code locally again pull requests

560
00:19:14,400 --> 00:19:17,460
and contribution collaboration all very

561
00:19:17,460 --> 00:19:19,020
welcome

562
00:19:19,020 --> 00:19:21,240
so you may have noticed the way that I

563
00:19:21,240 --> 00:19:22,679
wrote the policy it's designed and

564
00:19:22,679 --> 00:19:25,020
distributed it lends itself well to

565
00:19:25,020 --> 00:19:27,660
coexist with itself in a kubernetes

566
00:19:27,660 --> 00:19:30,299
cluster which brings us to a few more

567
00:19:30,299 --> 00:19:32,640
repos so there's cluster one uh which

568
00:19:32,640 --> 00:19:34,559
describes a cluster that accepts all the

569
00:19:34,559 --> 00:19:37,620
versions that we've described so far

570
00:19:37,620 --> 00:19:41,100
likewise cluster 2 only accepts 2.00 and

571
00:19:41,100 --> 00:19:42,720
greater

572
00:19:42,720 --> 00:19:44,940
so we can automate all of this using

573
00:19:44,940 --> 00:19:48,240
kind for CI to deploy the apps

574
00:19:48,240 --> 00:19:50,100
uh and there we have it a full org all

575
00:19:50,100 --> 00:19:51,840
done all compliant policy all version

576
00:19:51,840 --> 00:19:54,419
CIO all aware of what's going on so this

577
00:19:54,419 --> 00:19:55,260
is great

578
00:19:55,260 --> 00:19:57,000
but just one more thing wouldn't it be

579
00:19:57,000 --> 00:19:59,039
awesome if the policy carried a story

580
00:19:59,039 --> 00:20:01,440
about why it exists

581
00:20:01,440 --> 00:20:03,419
after all if your agile team is even

582
00:20:03,419 --> 00:20:05,100
half effective it will reject anything

583
00:20:05,100 --> 00:20:06,660
it perceives as friction if it doesn't

584
00:20:06,660 --> 00:20:08,160
see the value in it

585
00:20:08,160 --> 00:20:10,080
it could allow our devs to know why

586
00:20:10,080 --> 00:20:11,640
they're compliant and if they need want

587
00:20:11,640 --> 00:20:13,500
to do something outside what the policy

588
00:20:13,500 --> 00:20:15,120
permits they don't need any sort of

589
00:20:15,120 --> 00:20:17,160
exemption granted per se they can have a

590
00:20:17,160 --> 00:20:18,840
well reasoned and informed debate with

591
00:20:18,840 --> 00:20:20,520
rationale behind a pull request to the

592
00:20:20,520 --> 00:20:22,500
policy so imagine if you will that's

593
00:20:22,500 --> 00:20:23,760
going through a stage of versions with

594
00:20:23,760 --> 00:20:26,039
risks that inform mitigations manifested

595
00:20:26,039 --> 00:20:27,960
as policy all maintained as one so when

596
00:20:27,960 --> 00:20:29,700
the risk landscape changes your policy

597
00:20:29,700 --> 00:20:31,919
can move with it when some new privacy

598
00:20:31,919 --> 00:20:33,780
regulation comes out say or your latest

599
00:20:33,780 --> 00:20:35,700
marketing strategy pays off or you

600
00:20:35,700 --> 00:20:37,380
require more data for example even if

601
00:20:37,380 --> 00:20:39,720
your policy was perfect at one time the

602
00:20:39,720 --> 00:20:41,160
risks in the appetite will stand still

603
00:20:41,160 --> 00:20:43,080
for no one so we can liken this to

604
00:20:43,080 --> 00:20:44,400
overprician that we might be familiar

605
00:20:44,400 --> 00:20:45,900
with from elsewhere where lead times are

606
00:20:45,900 --> 00:20:47,700
long changes hard and there is a

607
00:20:47,700 --> 00:20:49,080
significant pressure in nailing it first

608
00:20:49,080 --> 00:20:50,820
time which can lead us to hedging bets

609
00:20:50,820 --> 00:20:52,740
against what some future State might be

610
00:20:52,740 --> 00:20:54,660
rather than proportionate mitigation to

611
00:20:54,660 --> 00:20:56,580
the risks that are more tangibly real in

612
00:20:56,580 --> 00:20:57,660
the now

613
00:20:57,660 --> 00:20:58,980
so that's where the real culture change

614
00:20:58,980 --> 00:21:00,840
is needed and the execution of that is a

615
00:21:00,840 --> 00:21:03,240
long series of talks in of itself so now

616
00:21:03,240 --> 00:21:04,620
this is all really over to you honestly

617
00:21:04,620 --> 00:21:06,000
the best thing you could do right now is

618
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:07,679
tell me that it's Madness already done

619
00:21:07,679 --> 00:21:09,660
irrelevant or otherwise unachievable

620
00:21:09,660 --> 00:21:11,580
something my esteemed Echo chamber

621
00:21:11,580 --> 00:21:13,140
appears have yet to do

622
00:21:13,140 --> 00:21:14,640
so beyond making pull requests and

623
00:21:14,640 --> 00:21:16,080
developing the theory more I'd really

624
00:21:16,080 --> 00:21:17,580
like to start building more case studies

625
00:21:17,580 --> 00:21:19,980
with willing organizations and allow me

626
00:21:19,980 --> 00:21:21,600
to swap out some of my imaginary friends

627
00:21:21,600 --> 00:21:23,820
for real ones but the most important

628
00:21:23,820 --> 00:21:25,260
thing that I want you to remember from

629
00:21:25,260 --> 00:21:27,600
our time together is and feel free to

630
00:21:27,600 --> 00:21:29,520
say this out loud with me that

631
00:21:29,520 --> 00:21:31,559
purposeless policy is potentially

632
00:21:31,559 --> 00:21:34,320
practically pointless policy which I've

633
00:21:34,320 --> 00:21:36,059
been practicing saying far too many

634
00:21:36,059 --> 00:21:38,640
times so I've been Chris Nesbitt Smith

635
00:21:38,640 --> 00:21:40,440
thank you so much for your time now free

636
00:21:40,440 --> 00:21:42,659
to leave I will destroy the evidence of

637
00:21:42,659 --> 00:21:45,299
your guilt admissions earlier maybe uh

638
00:21:45,299 --> 00:21:46,799
like subscribe whatever the kids do on

639
00:21:46,799 --> 00:21:48,600
LinkedIn GitHub and you can be rest

640
00:21:48,600 --> 00:21:50,340
assured that there'll be no spam or much

641
00:21:50,340 --> 00:21:52,200
content at all since I'm awful at any

642
00:21:52,200 --> 00:21:54,120
sort of self-promotion especially on

643
00:21:54,120 --> 00:21:56,400
social media so cns.me actually just

644
00:21:56,400 --> 00:21:58,620
points to my LinkedIn talks.cns me

645
00:21:58,620 --> 00:22:00,419
contains this and other talks and

646
00:22:00,419 --> 00:22:02,400
they're all open source and I've

647
00:22:02,400 --> 00:22:06,440
probably definitely run over sorry

648
00:22:06,919 --> 00:22:10,200
no worries you win the prize for today's

649
00:22:10,200 --> 00:22:14,780
most slides in a single presentation

650
00:22:15,080 --> 00:22:17,340
we don't have time for any questions on

651
00:22:17,340 --> 00:22:18,840
this one I'm afraid but if you want to

652
00:22:18,840 --> 00:22:21,480
hang out in the Discord Chris I'm sure

653
00:22:21,480 --> 00:22:23,700
there's some folks who might want to uh

654
00:22:23,700 --> 00:22:25,380
to have further discussions about this

655
00:22:25,380 --> 00:22:27,360
because there's been a lot of uh of of

656
00:22:27,360 --> 00:22:30,360
folks saying they've really enjoyed it

657
00:22:30,360 --> 00:22:34,280
okay thanks a lot thanks
