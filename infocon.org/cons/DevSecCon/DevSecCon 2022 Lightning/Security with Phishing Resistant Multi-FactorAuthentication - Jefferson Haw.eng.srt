Solutions on how organizations can

10
00:00:20,760 --> 00:00:22,980
secure the different identities that

11
00:00:22,980 --> 00:00:24,779
exists within the ecosystem in a

12
00:00:24,779 --> 00:00:27,720
frictionless approach therefore OCTA he

13
00:00:27,720 --> 00:00:29,699
worked with multiple technology vendor

14
00:00:29,699 --> 00:00:32,279
organizations thus allowing him to use

15

this breadth of knowledge to help

16
00:00:33,960 --> 00:00:36,180
companies adopt a zero trust

17
00:00:36,180 --> 00:00:37,380
architecture model

18
00:00:37,380 --> 00:00:40,320
and he'll be giving a talk on security

19
00:00:40,320 --> 00:00:42,899
with a phishing resistant manufacturer

20
00:00:42,899 --> 00:00:45,239
approach with the title harder better

42
00:01:31,439 --> 00:01:34,020
because it's your day still starting uh

43
00:01:34,020 --> 00:01:37,020
good evening for apj uh people who are

44
00:01:37,020 --> 00:01:38,280
still tuning in again my name is

45
00:01:38,280 --> 00:01:40,200
Jefferson how and I'm here to basically

46
00:01:40,200 --> 00:01:42,600
talk about uh how can you basically

47
00:01:42,600 --> 00:01:44,460
provide better security using phishing

48
00:01:44,460 --> 00:01:46,140
resistant factors right before I can

49
00:01:46,140 --> 00:01:48,479
start off my talk I have to like play

50
00:01:48,479 --> 00:01:50,060
this song

51
00:01:50,060 --> 00:01:53,540
it makes sense

52
00:01:53,540 --> 00:01:55,920
so that's where the inspiration of that

53
00:01:55,920 --> 00:01:58,079
title came from right that song but

54
00:01:58,079 --> 00:02:00,479
again let's uh go to the meat of the

55
00:02:00,479 --> 00:02:01,799
topic because I only have like 20

56
00:02:01,799 --> 00:02:03,840
minutes right so first thing foremost

57
00:02:03,840 --> 00:02:05,939
right again agenda right so what I'm

58
00:02:05,939 --> 00:02:07,380
gonna talk about is what are phishing

59
00:02:07,380 --> 00:02:10,080
attacks why are they happening what are

60
00:02:10,080 --> 00:02:11,760
what what is it doing how it is

61
00:02:11,760 --> 00:02:13,620
happening then the next part of the

62
00:02:13,620 --> 00:02:15,300
section what are we doing from a

63
00:02:15,300 --> 00:02:17,520
security uh technology a security

64
00:02:17,520 --> 00:02:19,680
company what are we doing uh to prevent

65
00:02:19,680 --> 00:02:21,360
phishing attacks and basically given I

66
00:02:21,360 --> 00:02:23,459
work for OCTA how can we prevent them

67
00:02:23,459 --> 00:02:25,440
from happening or how can we avoid

68
00:02:25,440 --> 00:02:27,660
phishing and prevent them from happening

69
00:02:27,660 --> 00:02:29,640
right and lastly just key takeaway or

70
00:02:29,640 --> 00:02:32,220
summary so first things first what and

71
00:02:32,220 --> 00:02:34,860
why and how what are phishing attacks so

72
00:02:34,860 --> 00:02:36,660
fishing attacks is basically a simple

73
00:02:36,660 --> 00:02:39,180
yet dangerous and effective way to get

74
00:02:39,180 --> 00:02:42,540
data from any individual again given

75
00:02:42,540 --> 00:02:44,360
that everyone recently done Black Friday

76
00:02:44,360 --> 00:02:47,700
or Cyber Monday I think you might have

77
00:02:47,700 --> 00:02:49,500
received some sort of phishing attack on

78
00:02:49,500 --> 00:02:51,239
those days right so what phishing is

79
00:02:51,239 --> 00:02:54,180
trying to do is we're trying an attacker

80
00:02:54,180 --> 00:02:56,640
or a threat actor is trying to trick

81
00:02:56,640 --> 00:02:58,739
potential victims from sharing sensitive

82
00:02:58,739 --> 00:03:01,379
information or sending from either from

83
00:03:01,379 --> 00:03:03,120
sending the money or doing account

84
00:03:03,120 --> 00:03:05,640
takeover right so this is why as you can

85
00:03:05,640 --> 00:03:08,580
as you heard right that Uber or the or

86
00:03:08,580 --> 00:03:11,220
the twilio hacks that recently got

87
00:03:11,220 --> 00:03:12,659
reported started with the phishing

88
00:03:12,659 --> 00:03:14,159
attempt and the problem with fishing at

89
00:03:14,159 --> 00:03:17,459
them it's very common these days and

90
00:03:17,459 --> 00:03:18,840
it's very easy to lure people because

91
00:03:18,840 --> 00:03:21,060
the track actors are trying to become

92
00:03:21,060 --> 00:03:23,760
creative right so let's take let's first

93
00:03:23,760 --> 00:03:24,840
understand what are the different

94
00:03:24,840 --> 00:03:27,959
fishing uh approaches right so there are

95
00:03:27,959 --> 00:03:30,060
several phishing approaches one is

96
00:03:30,060 --> 00:03:32,519
basically they call this machine so I

97
00:03:32,519 --> 00:03:34,319
think once most likely in everyone's

98
00:03:34,319 --> 00:03:36,720
lifetime you might have received an SMS

99
00:03:36,720 --> 00:03:39,180
saying hey you just recently got a

100
00:03:39,180 --> 00:03:41,340
certain logistic click this link to

101
00:03:41,340 --> 00:03:44,879
basically pick up that uh that delivery

102
00:03:44,879 --> 00:03:46,560
that you recently made right even though

103
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:48,360
you didn't did one right so that's a

104
00:03:48,360 --> 00:03:51,120
smashing type of event right the

105
00:03:51,120 --> 00:03:53,340
attackers using SMS then there's also

106
00:03:53,340 --> 00:03:55,860
wishing or just using phone calls now

107
00:03:55,860 --> 00:03:58,200
again every now and then you might in

108
00:03:58,200 --> 00:04:00,120
Australia I live in Sydney I always get

109
00:04:00,120 --> 00:04:02,099
phone calls uh we're in the phone call

110
00:04:02,099 --> 00:04:06,120
is claiming to be uh a tax officer when

111
00:04:06,120 --> 00:04:08,340
I claim I need to get I need to pay them

112
00:04:08,340 --> 00:04:10,680
some amount because I'm in offense with

113
00:04:10,680 --> 00:04:12,299
some tax regulations right so that's

114
00:04:12,299 --> 00:04:14,280
pushing so there's the common ones what

115
00:04:14,280 --> 00:04:16,199
we normally receive back then when it is

116
00:04:16,199 --> 00:04:18,298
called email phishing spear fishing or

117
00:04:18,298 --> 00:04:20,820
railing right this could be like your

118
00:04:20,820 --> 00:04:22,620
common service provider like Amazon or

119
00:04:22,620 --> 00:04:24,960
Netflix sending you uh an email saying

120
00:04:24,960 --> 00:04:27,360
for some reason uh you something

121
00:04:27,360 --> 00:04:28,800
happened to your account and click this

122
00:04:28,800 --> 00:04:31,740
now to that will near you to provide

123
00:04:31,740 --> 00:04:34,080
credentials right the other approach of

124
00:04:34,080 --> 00:04:36,960
email phishing is it could be having an

125
00:04:36,960 --> 00:04:39,419
attacker being able to compromise your

126
00:04:39,419 --> 00:04:41,840
corporate or your employees or your

127
00:04:41,840 --> 00:04:44,100
colleagues email such that they can use

128
00:04:44,100 --> 00:04:46,259
that email to send you links and from

129
00:04:46,259 --> 00:04:47,880
there it's more spear phishing because

130
00:04:47,880 --> 00:04:50,280
they're using it as a spirit and lastly

131
00:04:50,280 --> 00:04:52,080
the catfishing or social media phishing

132
00:04:52,080 --> 00:04:54,360
right so this is basically how social

133
00:04:54,360 --> 00:04:57,180
engineering can be the start of getting

134
00:04:57,180 --> 00:04:59,220
information right they would present

135
00:04:59,220 --> 00:05:00,900
themselves as people that

136
00:05:00,900 --> 00:05:02,580
that you know right even though you

137
00:05:02,580 --> 00:05:04,500
don't know it so there's an example of

138
00:05:04,500 --> 00:05:06,360
how a phishing works right again from

139
00:05:06,360 --> 00:05:09,360
left to right you'll see uh an email

140
00:05:09,360 --> 00:05:11,340
gets sent to the

141
00:05:11,340 --> 00:05:14,100
potential victim the victim goes to that

142
00:05:14,100 --> 00:05:16,139
landing page right and they will need to

143
00:05:16,139 --> 00:05:18,120
log in and most of the phishing attacks

144
00:05:18,120 --> 00:05:20,820
are trying to spoof uh you right they're

145
00:05:20,820 --> 00:05:22,620
trying to imitate as much as possible

146
00:05:22,620 --> 00:05:25,919
your login or your your security uh

147
00:05:25,919 --> 00:05:27,539
system to the point that it looks like

148
00:05:27,539 --> 00:05:28,680
similar

149
00:05:28,680 --> 00:05:31,320
uh as the original one and that's how

150
00:05:31,320 --> 00:05:33,479
phishing is very tricky and very scary

151
00:05:33,479 --> 00:05:37,440
now then just some facts like uh there's

152
00:05:37,440 --> 00:05:39,960
every year uh fishing is always on the

153
00:05:39,960 --> 00:05:42,720
rise there's actually a community now

154
00:05:42,720 --> 00:05:45,180
wherein it actually tracks all the

155
00:05:45,180 --> 00:05:46,740
fishing reports that they get from

156
00:05:46,740 --> 00:05:48,660
different users and from there they're

157
00:05:48,660 --> 00:05:52,620
able to create a report uh wherein it

158
00:05:52,620 --> 00:05:54,720
entails how many people were fish what

159
00:05:54,720 --> 00:05:56,520
were the impact or the damage that was

160
00:05:56,520 --> 00:05:59,880
happened which industry uh was basically

161
00:05:59,880 --> 00:06:01,680
fish a lot right so that's why you can

162
00:06:01,680 --> 00:06:03,120
see that's where the source of this

163
00:06:03,120 --> 00:06:05,039
report came from but one thing stands

164
00:06:05,039 --> 00:06:07,199
out every year on year or month on month

165
00:06:07,199 --> 00:06:09,720
everything goes up like fishing is gonna

166
00:06:09,720 --> 00:06:12,840
be here forever so what do we what are

167
00:06:12,840 --> 00:06:14,699
threat actors doing now right because I

168
00:06:14,699 --> 00:06:16,800
think everyone here is a devsecop or uh

169
00:06:16,800 --> 00:06:19,320
would say that I'm very I.T literate

170
00:06:19,320 --> 00:06:21,419
security literate to that point that I

171
00:06:21,419 --> 00:06:24,660
can actually be able to detect if this

172
00:06:24,660 --> 00:06:26,220
is a phishing site or not so but the

173
00:06:26,220 --> 00:06:27,960
challenge is that again threat actors or

174
00:06:27,960 --> 00:06:29,880
adversaries are being creative now so

175
00:06:29,880 --> 00:06:32,100
what do they do so right now what

176
00:06:32,100 --> 00:06:34,139
currently is available is what this tool

177
00:06:34,139 --> 00:06:35,699
called evil Gene X this is what I'm

178
00:06:35,699 --> 00:06:37,860
going to demonstrate here on right and

179
00:06:37,860 --> 00:06:41,100
this evil Genex acts as a proxy to your

180
00:06:41,100 --> 00:06:44,520
actual original security platform and it

181
00:06:44,520 --> 00:06:46,199
will actually imitate how the look and

182
00:06:46,199 --> 00:06:48,360
feel of your security platform when it

183
00:06:48,360 --> 00:06:50,819
can capture not only shared information

184
00:06:50,819 --> 00:06:54,240
but also even imitate the MFA or 2fa

185
00:06:54,240 --> 00:06:55,979
side of things right so that's how

186
00:06:55,979 --> 00:06:58,080
creative this tool is so if you want to

187
00:06:58,080 --> 00:06:59,940
research more I think there's a GitHub

188
00:06:59,940 --> 00:07:02,460
repo or do a quick Google search on how

189
00:07:02,460 --> 00:07:04,979
this works but how does this works in

190
00:07:04,979 --> 00:07:06,360
essence is basically

191
00:07:06,360 --> 00:07:09,419
the user is targeted as you can see the

192
00:07:09,419 --> 00:07:12,360
users targeted uh with an email user

193
00:07:12,360 --> 00:07:14,160
provide click that link with that

194
00:07:14,160 --> 00:07:16,380
phishing email or phishing link uh

195
00:07:16,380 --> 00:07:18,180
what's happening is that this is an

196
00:07:18,180 --> 00:07:19,979
adversary in the middle or man in the

197
00:07:19,979 --> 00:07:21,419
middle attack wherein the threat actor

198
00:07:21,419 --> 00:07:24,000
is using evil GNX to basically proxy

199
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:25,500
your security platform or your

200
00:07:25,500 --> 00:07:27,720
legitimate web application then from

201
00:07:27,720 --> 00:07:29,819
there they're able to imitate the login

202
00:07:29,819 --> 00:07:32,580
page the authentication flow the MFA

203
00:07:32,580 --> 00:07:35,599
flow and eventually once you're able to

204
00:07:35,599 --> 00:07:41,400
uh uh uh basically gets poof with that

205
00:07:41,400 --> 00:07:43,680
that login flow you still get redirected

206
00:07:43,680 --> 00:07:46,259
to your actual uh page right but what's

207
00:07:46,259 --> 00:07:47,940
happening in the background that tool is

208
00:07:47,940 --> 00:07:49,979
actually able to capture the credentials

209
00:07:49,979 --> 00:07:52,860
in the session cookie uh from there from

210
00:07:52,860 --> 00:07:54,780
that from their engine right from that

211
00:07:54,780 --> 00:07:57,120
uh fishing phishing tool then from there

212
00:07:57,120 --> 00:07:59,520
that fishing was able now to replay that

213
00:07:59,520 --> 00:08:01,740
cookie to imitate you such that the

214
00:08:01,740 --> 00:08:04,620
third actor has now have the ability to

215
00:08:04,620 --> 00:08:07,020
access your keys to the kingdom or your

216
00:08:07,020 --> 00:08:09,479
price too so this is basically how Uber

217
00:08:09,479 --> 00:08:12,780
or the uh that twilio hacks could happen

218
00:08:12,780 --> 00:08:15,180
as well in the backup so what are we

219
00:08:15,180 --> 00:08:16,560
doing in from an industry standpoint

220
00:08:16,560 --> 00:08:18,120
from a Securities industry standpoint

221
00:08:18,120 --> 00:08:19,860
right so what we're doing now is

222
00:08:19,860 --> 00:08:22,020
providing phishing resistant factors or

223
00:08:22,020 --> 00:08:24,360
authenticators so the three major

224
00:08:24,360 --> 00:08:26,460
factors of a tree of phishing resistant

225
00:08:26,460 --> 00:08:29,280
factor is it it uses no shared secret so

226
00:08:29,280 --> 00:08:30,840
what happens now you don't need to

227
00:08:30,840 --> 00:08:33,059
provide an SMS OTP or a push

228
00:08:33,059 --> 00:08:35,339
notification confirmation to basically

229
00:08:35,339 --> 00:08:36,958
do that MFA challenge what we're doing

230
00:08:36,958 --> 00:08:39,539
is using a cryptographically signed and

231
00:08:39,539 --> 00:08:42,299
private key stored in your machine which

232
00:08:42,299 --> 00:08:43,559
is could be stored in your Hardware

233
00:08:43,559 --> 00:08:46,080
security module or your security Enclave

234
00:08:46,080 --> 00:08:48,240
such that you'll be able to guarantee

235
00:08:48,240 --> 00:08:50,640
who you are and prove authenticity and

236
00:08:50,640 --> 00:08:54,080
also make sure that that uh MFA Factor

237
00:08:54,080 --> 00:08:56,459
that's using this capability that's

238
00:08:56,459 --> 00:08:59,580
delivered via 502 or Web Bot n is also

239
00:08:59,580 --> 00:09:02,459
uh uh upholding the highest security

240
00:09:02,459 --> 00:09:04,320
level or Assurance level right it's

241
00:09:04,320 --> 00:09:06,420
origin bound meaning that every time you

242
00:09:06,420 --> 00:09:07,800
enroll that phishing assistant

243
00:09:07,800 --> 00:09:10,399
authenticator Factor it all it's only

244
00:09:10,399 --> 00:09:12,420
acknowledged and registered to the

245
00:09:12,420 --> 00:09:14,820
origin where you registered it so

246
00:09:14,820 --> 00:09:16,740
meaning that if you registered it on an

247
00:09:16,740 --> 00:09:19,320
actual legitimate site that you control

248
00:09:19,320 --> 00:09:21,720
that factor will that phishing resistant

249
00:09:21,720 --> 00:09:23,700
Factor will only work on that side and

250
00:09:23,700 --> 00:09:25,920
lastly it's trusted right so something

251
00:09:25,920 --> 00:09:27,360
like providers like OCTA we actually

252
00:09:27,360 --> 00:09:29,700
provide an authenticator that you can

253
00:09:29,700 --> 00:09:31,800
deploy on your workstation and the great

254
00:09:31,800 --> 00:09:33,360
thing here is that you can use that as

255
00:09:33,360 --> 00:09:35,160
that authenticator can become an

256
00:09:35,160 --> 00:09:37,680
attestation uh piece that will allow us

257
00:09:37,680 --> 00:09:39,240
to make sure that everything is coming

258
00:09:39,240 --> 00:09:41,339
from a trusted flow and we're also

259
00:09:41,339 --> 00:09:42,899
picking up additional signals out of it

260
00:09:42,899 --> 00:09:45,660
right so how does that work now in

261
00:09:45,660 --> 00:09:48,000
replay to the flow that I've shown

262
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:49,500
earlier right so the difference now is

263
00:09:49,500 --> 00:09:52,140
that given the factor is no longer a

264
00:09:52,140 --> 00:09:54,420
shared secret the biggest difference is

265
00:09:54,420 --> 00:09:56,580
that the threat actor cannot replay or

266
00:09:56,580 --> 00:09:58,560
proxy that MFA flow because that's

267
00:09:58,560 --> 00:10:01,560
origin bow meaning that once you repay a

268
00:10:01,560 --> 00:10:03,720
user authenticator to a different origin

269
00:10:03,720 --> 00:10:04,980
or URL

270
00:10:04,980 --> 00:10:08,399
the MFA the legitimate site will or the

271
00:10:08,399 --> 00:10:10,920
the authenticator the phishing versus an

272
00:10:10,920 --> 00:10:12,660
authenticator actually say that this is

273
00:10:12,660 --> 00:10:13,980
not the right the site where you

274
00:10:13,980 --> 00:10:15,300
registered it so it will not even

275
00:10:15,300 --> 00:10:17,640
support uh allowing the user to continue

276
00:10:17,640 --> 00:10:19,260
forward right so what happens there

277
00:10:19,260 --> 00:10:21,060
we're now preventing the threat actor to

278
00:10:21,060 --> 00:10:23,220
capture the mpa credentials and also

279
00:10:23,220 --> 00:10:25,019
being able to store or hijack that

280
00:10:25,019 --> 00:10:26,339
session cookie

281
00:10:26,339 --> 00:10:28,560
so I just talked about how the

282
00:10:28,560 --> 00:10:30,600
technology or industry looks at phishing

283
00:10:30,600 --> 00:10:32,399
assistant authenticators let's look at

284
00:10:32,399 --> 00:10:34,080
how OCTA looks at it right or how can

285
00:10:34,080 --> 00:10:37,260
OCTA help so how OCTA can help we

286
00:10:37,260 --> 00:10:39,480
actually uh employ defense in them right

287
00:10:39,480 --> 00:10:41,760
so we only we rely fishing or system

288
00:10:41,760 --> 00:10:44,880
authenticators as one uh one layer of

289
00:10:44,880 --> 00:10:46,680
security but we also look at things in

290
00:10:46,680 --> 00:10:49,079
different layers or we like in an onion

291
00:10:49,079 --> 00:10:51,300
you peel it in different layers right so

292
00:10:51,300 --> 00:10:54,000
what we're doing is basically using uh

293
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:55,680
first different line of defense the

294
00:10:55,680 --> 00:10:57,300
first line of defense could be the

295
00:10:57,300 --> 00:10:59,700
security policies that you define within

296
00:10:59,700 --> 00:11:02,399
OCTA right this will dictate which users

297
00:11:02,399 --> 00:11:06,180
uh should are allowed to be challenged

298
00:11:06,180 --> 00:11:08,399
for certain authenticator factors what

299
00:11:08,399 --> 00:11:10,560
policy do we want to enforce the second

300
00:11:10,560 --> 00:11:12,540
line is the authenticator side of things

301
00:11:12,540 --> 00:11:14,519
where how can we basically use fishing

302
00:11:14,519 --> 00:11:17,040
resistant authenticators and pave way to

303
00:11:17,040 --> 00:11:18,660
a passwordless approach right such that

304
00:11:18,660 --> 00:11:21,720
you can use it as a way to deliver a way

305
00:11:21,720 --> 00:11:23,160
where end users don't even need to type

306
00:11:23,160 --> 00:11:25,740
in a password right everything's bounded

307
00:11:25,740 --> 00:11:28,260
to that authenticator or that UB key

308
00:11:28,260 --> 00:11:30,240
that you're using the third line of

309
00:11:30,240 --> 00:11:31,560
defense would be the contextual access

310
00:11:31,560 --> 00:11:33,300
right this is just basically how can we

311
00:11:33,300 --> 00:11:35,399
pick up additional signals like whether

312
00:11:35,399 --> 00:11:37,320
are using a corporate device a BYOD

313
00:11:37,320 --> 00:11:40,380
device are you using a device Assurance

314
00:11:40,380 --> 00:11:41,820
this is basically something new that

315
00:11:41,820 --> 00:11:43,800
after recently released and how can we

316
00:11:43,800 --> 00:11:46,620
pick up like the version or the OS of

317
00:11:46,620 --> 00:11:48,120
your platform that you're using whether

318
00:11:48,120 --> 00:11:51,600
it's sale broken is there uh security uh

319
00:11:51,600 --> 00:11:53,579
encryption applied on the

320
00:11:53,579 --> 00:11:56,040
hardest level then there's also the

321
00:11:56,040 --> 00:11:58,320
network the location the threat inside

322
00:11:58,320 --> 00:12:01,740
side of things right and basically this

323
00:12:01,740 --> 00:12:03,540
is just basically using risk and also

324
00:12:03,540 --> 00:12:05,100
Behavior as part of the process and

325
00:12:05,100 --> 00:12:07,620
lastly given it's a setups the checkups

326
00:12:07,620 --> 00:12:09,420
the second uh conference we look at

327
00:12:09,420 --> 00:12:11,100
observability how do we make use of

328
00:12:11,100 --> 00:12:13,260
different systems to talk to one another

329
00:12:13,260 --> 00:12:15,120
such that we can deliver that SEC Ops

330
00:12:15,120 --> 00:12:17,579
approach right of things so rather than

331
00:12:17,579 --> 00:12:19,500
talking more on after let's actually go

332
00:12:19,500 --> 00:12:21,600
to the demo right so the demo will

333
00:12:21,600 --> 00:12:23,700
basically need a playing using evil

334
00:12:23,700 --> 00:12:26,160
Genex deployed in an ews machine uh

335
00:12:26,160 --> 00:12:28,680
replicating an uh service that's being

336
00:12:28,680 --> 00:12:32,459
proxy then I'll basically stop sharing

337
00:12:32,459 --> 00:12:36,660
give me a second and I'll share my

338
00:12:36,660 --> 00:12:38,880
screen now

339
00:12:38,880 --> 00:12:42,360
give me a second windows

340
00:12:42,360 --> 00:12:44,839
cool

341
00:12:45,779 --> 00:12:47,820
yeah screen too

342
00:12:47,820 --> 00:12:50,760
so what I'm gonna do is

343
00:12:50,760 --> 00:12:53,040
I'm gonna so what I what I'm sharing to

344
00:12:53,040 --> 00:12:55,920
you right now is give me a second

345
00:12:55,920 --> 00:12:57,720
share so you should see a blank screen

346
00:12:57,720 --> 00:12:59,519
right it will have just a terminal so

347
00:12:59,519 --> 00:13:01,440
what I'm gonna do now is basically Run

348
00:13:01,440 --> 00:13:03,959
Eagle GNX so as you can see that's evil

349
00:13:03,959 --> 00:13:06,120
Gen X running in the background right so

350
00:13:06,120 --> 00:13:09,540
that's gonna be proxy OCTA so however

351
00:13:09,540 --> 00:13:12,000
that look like is let's say I have like

352
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:15,980
I will have I will show my actual

353
00:13:15,980 --> 00:13:17,760
uh

354
00:13:17,760 --> 00:13:20,899
give me a second

355
00:13:22,459 --> 00:13:25,620
I will actually show the actual uh

356
00:13:25,620 --> 00:13:28,200
service that's a bit legitimate so as

357
00:13:28,200 --> 00:13:29,220
you can see this is the actual

358
00:13:29,220 --> 00:13:33,959
legitimate uh Atco unit sorry about that

359
00:13:33,959 --> 00:13:36,300
one so that's a legitimate uh website

360
00:13:36,300 --> 00:13:38,040
right so as you can see because because

361
00:13:38,040 --> 00:13:40,200
I'm basically Sydney Sydney everything

362
00:13:40,200 --> 00:13:42,899
is like showing in Sydney background so

363
00:13:42,899 --> 00:13:45,540
right now I have a test user called uh

364
00:13:45,540 --> 00:13:49,260
and uh Scotland so right now this is the

365
00:13:49,260 --> 00:13:51,300
legitimate website and I'm gonna run it

366
00:13:51,300 --> 00:13:53,279
now with a fake website on the right

367
00:13:53,279 --> 00:13:55,380
hand side here right I'm going to use

368
00:13:55,380 --> 00:13:57,300
evil gnext to proxy everything so

369
00:13:57,300 --> 00:13:59,639
normally again the phishing link will be

370
00:13:59,639 --> 00:14:01,740
delivered through an email but right now

371
00:14:01,740 --> 00:14:04,920
I'm just gonna do it in manual fashion

372
00:14:04,920 --> 00:14:06,779
so as you can see given I'm just poofing

373
00:14:06,779 --> 00:14:10,320
it I'm trying to make it as uh as as

374
00:14:10,320 --> 00:14:12,120
dangerous as possible right I didn't

375
00:14:12,120 --> 00:14:16,380
even loaded my uh trusted SSL search but

376
00:14:16,380 --> 00:14:19,260
again if I have if I was attempting to

377
00:14:19,260 --> 00:14:22,560
fish people my role is just to add

378
00:14:22,560 --> 00:14:24,720
proper search here to make it like look

379
00:14:24,720 --> 00:14:27,180
as legit as possible

380
00:14:27,180 --> 00:14:29,279
so as you can see right now this is now

381
00:14:29,279 --> 00:14:32,339
me loading uh again like uh I'll just

382
00:14:32,339 --> 00:14:35,040
I'll just have it on the right side so

383
00:14:35,040 --> 00:14:37,040
as you can see this is approximately

384
00:14:37,040 --> 00:14:39,839
replicated the same it looks similar as

385
00:14:39,839 --> 00:14:41,940
as it can be to the point like it looks

386
00:14:41,940 --> 00:14:44,519
very true to itself right so what I'm

387
00:14:44,519 --> 00:14:46,260
going to do now is I'm gonna basically

388
00:14:46,260 --> 00:14:49,920
log in as a test user

389
00:14:49,920 --> 00:14:51,480
Scott

390
00:14:51,480 --> 00:14:53,220
and on the right on the left hand side

391
00:14:53,220 --> 00:14:55,019
you can see right that's basically evil

392
00:14:55,019 --> 00:14:56,699
genetic running right so right now I'll

393
00:14:56,699 --> 00:14:58,800
just show how you can basically how evil

394
00:14:58,800 --> 00:15:00,839
Genex can fish users so I'm now being

395
00:15:00,839 --> 00:15:02,399
asked for a password

396
00:15:02,399 --> 00:15:04,079
and as you can see the password is

397
00:15:04,079 --> 00:15:05,040
captured

398
00:15:05,040 --> 00:15:07,320
now this is the craziest part right so

399
00:15:07,320 --> 00:15:08,940
if I actually proceed the push

400
00:15:08,940 --> 00:15:10,620
notification as well

401
00:15:10,620 --> 00:15:12,899
as you can see I'm able to deliver a

402
00:15:12,899 --> 00:15:14,459
push and the problem with this one this

403
00:15:14,459 --> 00:15:16,579
is also uh with this approach people

404
00:15:16,579 --> 00:15:19,320
attackers can now do fishing bombs or

405
00:15:19,320 --> 00:15:21,360
sorry MFA fatigue where they'll just

406
00:15:21,360 --> 00:15:23,639
keep pushing MFA to the user to the

407
00:15:23,639 --> 00:15:25,800
point that automatically the user will

408
00:15:25,800 --> 00:15:27,899
just submit to that phishing bomb right

409
00:15:27,899 --> 00:15:30,060
so automatically as soon as I was able

410
00:15:30,060 --> 00:15:32,639
to log in I was able to again

411
00:15:32,639 --> 00:15:36,300
uh login successfully to OCTA

412
00:15:36,300 --> 00:15:37,680
and now

413
00:15:37,680 --> 00:15:40,019
if I actually go to sessions I'll just

414
00:15:40,019 --> 00:15:43,260
stop there and you can see that I'm able

415
00:15:43,260 --> 00:15:44,339
to

416
00:15:44,339 --> 00:15:48,480
I'll just cancel this one

417
00:15:48,480 --> 00:15:50,880
yep that's that one

418
00:15:50,880 --> 00:15:52,560
so as you can see I'm able to hijack

419
00:15:52,560 --> 00:15:54,300
Scott's session now what's happening in

420
00:15:54,300 --> 00:15:55,680
the background so how do we prevent this

421
00:15:55,680 --> 00:15:57,899
right so to prevent this what we can do

422
00:15:57,899 --> 00:16:00,779
is basically uh apply phishing resistant

423
00:16:00,779 --> 00:16:02,279
authenticators right so when I mean

424
00:16:02,279 --> 00:16:04,980
fishing resistant authenticators uh what

425
00:16:04,980 --> 00:16:07,800
we want to do is rather than using

426
00:16:07,800 --> 00:16:10,380
uh

427
00:16:10,380 --> 00:16:12,540
a password to log in

428
00:16:12,540 --> 00:16:15,180
I can actually still

429
00:16:15,180 --> 00:16:18,420
use uh like what what we can do is

430
00:16:18,420 --> 00:16:21,000
basically use an authenticator that OCTA

431
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:23,459
provides and this authenticator is what

432
00:16:23,459 --> 00:16:26,519
we call uh OCTA verify right OCTA verify

433
00:16:26,519 --> 00:16:29,160
is a authenticator that gets installed

434
00:16:29,160 --> 00:16:31,019
in the user's machine

435
00:16:31,019 --> 00:16:34,019
and automatically uh that becomes like

436
00:16:34,019 --> 00:16:35,880
the way how we can challenge user for

437
00:16:35,880 --> 00:16:38,100
authentication right now not it's

438
00:16:38,100 --> 00:16:39,660
preventing the user to log in now

439
00:16:39,660 --> 00:16:42,000
because the authenticator is able to

440
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:44,699
verify that this is a fake site right so

441
00:16:44,699 --> 00:16:46,620
that what's happening now we're not able

442
00:16:46,620 --> 00:16:49,259
to proceed to even to log in right so

443
00:16:49,259 --> 00:16:52,320
what's also nice is that if I actually

444
00:16:52,320 --> 00:16:53,839
share

445
00:16:53,839 --> 00:16:58,940
the system logs from OCTA side

446
00:17:01,320 --> 00:17:03,959
again right we're able to basically uh

447
00:17:03,959 --> 00:17:06,059
capture

448
00:17:06,059 --> 00:17:07,980
uh an event

449
00:17:07,980 --> 00:17:10,199
that is saying that the user has been

450
00:17:10,199 --> 00:17:12,000
fish

451
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:13,859
give me a second I think there's a lot

452
00:17:13,859 --> 00:17:16,819
of things happening here

453
00:17:20,099 --> 00:17:22,199
as fast as I'm pushing a thing so this

454
00:17:22,199 --> 00:17:23,880
is how OCTA is able to prevent phishing

455
00:17:23,880 --> 00:17:25,740
attempts because our authenticator app

456
00:17:25,740 --> 00:17:28,020
is automatically able to predict if it's

457
00:17:28,020 --> 00:17:29,940
a phishing attempt or not and that's a

458
00:17:29,940 --> 00:17:31,820
great thing with October and Truth

459
00:17:31,820 --> 00:17:35,160
authenticators like uh like uh fishing

460
00:17:35,160 --> 00:17:36,720
resistant authenticators were able to

461
00:17:36,720 --> 00:17:40,380
prevent users from from being preventing

462
00:17:40,380 --> 00:17:42,120
them from actually being able to be

463
00:17:42,120 --> 00:17:45,000
fished from uh proxy providers like evil

464
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:47,520
GNX one thing I also want to show is

465
00:17:47,520 --> 00:17:49,020
basically part of the process the

466
00:17:49,020 --> 00:17:51,120
background every time a phishing attack

467
00:17:51,120 --> 00:17:53,460
is captured by OCTA to that event we're

468
00:17:53,460 --> 00:17:56,700
actually even able to orchestrate uh an

469
00:17:56,700 --> 00:17:58,320
email in the background that can be

470
00:17:58,320 --> 00:18:00,299
triggered and sent to your admin Traders

471
00:18:00,299 --> 00:18:02,400
or to the end user that they were fish

472
00:18:02,400 --> 00:18:05,400
that or they were almost fish and we can

473
00:18:05,400 --> 00:18:07,020
now prevent that I'll give them

474
00:18:07,020 --> 00:18:08,880
awareness that they should not be

475
00:18:08,880 --> 00:18:10,740
attempting to log into that fake or

476
00:18:10,740 --> 00:18:12,660
malicious site so that's how basically

477
00:18:12,660 --> 00:18:15,660
how OCTA is able to apply harder better

478
00:18:15,660 --> 00:18:17,400
faster stronger security with phishing

479
00:18:17,400 --> 00:18:19,020
resistant factors

480
00:18:19,020 --> 00:18:22,740
so going back to uh to my slide just to

481
00:18:22,740 --> 00:18:25,160
cap off

482
00:18:25,919 --> 00:18:28,400
second

483
00:18:29,760 --> 00:18:31,500
yep here

484
00:18:31,500 --> 00:18:33,900
so to cap off like this is how it

485
00:18:33,900 --> 00:18:35,880
basically how OCTA was able to prevent

486
00:18:35,880 --> 00:18:38,940
phishing attacks uh the person was lured

487
00:18:38,940 --> 00:18:42,240
to a fake website user uh this is a fake

488
00:18:42,240 --> 00:18:45,240
Quest website uh given that the user was

489
00:18:45,240 --> 00:18:47,100
able to click with login with OCTA

490
00:18:47,100 --> 00:18:49,320
through OCTA Fastpass we're able to

491
00:18:49,320 --> 00:18:52,559
basically sign uh basic design response

492
00:18:52,559 --> 00:18:54,000
with origin header and device contact

493
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:57,059
signals to the r OCTA service given that

494
00:18:57,059 --> 00:19:00,000
that that that that Source or attempt

495
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:01,860
was coming from a malicious website were

496
00:19:01,860 --> 00:19:04,440
able to create a phishing alert and

497
00:19:04,440 --> 00:19:06,559
basically automatically alert the user

498
00:19:06,559 --> 00:19:09,299
uh with suspicious activity and in the

499
00:19:09,299 --> 00:19:11,400
background we're able to achieve an

500
00:19:11,400 --> 00:19:14,400
attack Ops capability to drive uh email

501
00:19:14,400 --> 00:19:18,179
or SMS certification so in summary uh

502
00:19:18,179 --> 00:19:20,100
what I wanna the key takeaways is

503
00:19:20,100 --> 00:19:21,980
basically how can you basically apply

504
00:19:21,980 --> 00:19:25,320
harder uh security by applying fishing

505
00:19:25,320 --> 00:19:27,900
resistant authenticators uh within your

506
00:19:27,900 --> 00:19:30,600
organization better because we want to

507
00:19:30,600 --> 00:19:33,840
leverage different signals and and risk

508
00:19:33,840 --> 00:19:36,059
as part of the context evaluation we

509
00:19:36,059 --> 00:19:37,919
want to make it faster because uh we

510
00:19:37,919 --> 00:19:39,840
want to apply a passwordless approach

511
00:19:39,840 --> 00:19:41,700
which I did earlier right if we click

512
00:19:41,700 --> 00:19:43,919
that uh sign in with OCTA Fastpass

513
00:19:43,919 --> 00:19:46,200
button if it's a legitimate website the

514
00:19:46,200 --> 00:19:47,820
user will automatically be able to log

515
00:19:47,820 --> 00:19:50,940
in without providing any password hence

516
00:19:50,940 --> 00:19:52,500
we're avoiding shared Secrets being

517
00:19:52,500 --> 00:19:54,840
transmitted over the wire and lastly

518
00:19:54,840 --> 00:19:56,700
stronger so what we want to do is

519
00:19:56,700 --> 00:19:59,520
enforce observability regardless of

520
00:19:59,520 --> 00:20:01,080
what's happening in the background we're

521
00:20:01,080 --> 00:20:03,900
all continuously analyzing the different

522
00:20:03,900 --> 00:20:07,620
events or uh vectors that were optimized

523
00:20:07,620 --> 00:20:08,760
processing and other systems are

524
00:20:08,760 --> 00:20:10,080
processing such that we can deploy in

525
00:20:10,080 --> 00:20:12,600
security or concentration event so and

526
00:20:12,600 --> 00:20:14,340
that in a nutshell is harder better

527
00:20:14,340 --> 00:20:16,080
faster stronger security with phishing

528
00:20:16,080 --> 00:20:19,380
resistant actors and thank you

529
00:20:19,380 --> 00:20:21,480
thank you so much for that Jeff I think

530
00:20:21,480 --> 00:20:23,700
that was I think I I'm gonna ask the

531
00:20:23,700 --> 00:20:26,160
organizers to mandate a song at the

532
00:20:26,160 --> 00:20:27,900
beginning of every talk I think that was

533
00:20:27,900 --> 00:20:30,720
amazing and I think yeah what a

534
00:20:30,720 --> 00:20:32,520
wonderful way to start but I think also

535
00:20:32,520 --> 00:20:34,200
such an important talk I think MFA is

536
00:20:34,200 --> 00:20:36,059
one of those things where in 2022 and I

537
00:20:36,059 --> 00:20:37,140
think it's still one of those things

538
00:20:37,140 --> 00:20:39,660
that people just don't understand and

539
00:20:39,660 --> 00:20:41,880
the importance of and I think you you

540
00:20:41,880 --> 00:20:43,679
beautifully portrayed the whole

541
00:20:43,679 --> 00:20:45,900
transition and the demo gods were also

542
00:20:45,900 --> 00:20:48,240
with you which is amazing really enjoyed

543
00:20:48,240 --> 00:20:50,400
that talk thank you so much um Kumar did

544
00:20:50,400 --> 00:20:51,900
you have anything that you wanted to add

545
00:20:51,900 --> 00:20:55,320
yeah I always see MFA or fishing type of

546
00:20:55,320 --> 00:20:57,179
attacks from an operation standpoints

547
00:20:57,179 --> 00:20:58,700
one of the most common attack characters

548
00:20:58,700 --> 00:21:01,380
and as you mentioned MFA fatigue is

549
00:21:01,380 --> 00:21:02,780
pretty common too

550
00:21:02,780 --> 00:21:05,340
and different steps are being taken at

551
00:21:05,340 --> 00:21:07,140
the moment to like remediate this threat

552
00:21:07,140 --> 00:21:09,539
uh and yeah it's pretty good topic

553
00:21:09,539 --> 00:21:12,059
amazing well I just did have a we do

554
00:21:12,059 --> 00:21:13,679
have some love for you from people who

555
00:21:13,679 --> 00:21:15,059
are watching live so someone has said

556
00:21:15,059 --> 00:21:17,220
Jefferson is the best I used to work

557
00:21:17,220 --> 00:21:19,140
with you I think Randall has said yeah

558
00:21:19,140 --> 00:21:21,299
shout out to Randall shout out to

559
00:21:21,299 --> 00:21:24,480
Randall lots of love there and also a

560
00:21:24,480 --> 00:21:26,520
quick question what's the best way to

561
00:21:26,520 --> 00:21:30,080
get into the I am space

562
00:21:32,820 --> 00:21:35,640
yeah Security will always be part of the

563
00:21:35,640 --> 00:21:37,260
ecosystem right right as you can see

564
00:21:37,260 --> 00:21:38,820
that's why we have devsecond right

565
00:21:38,820 --> 00:21:40,620
because back then it was pretty devops

566
00:21:40,620 --> 00:21:42,659
only there's a shift to devsecoffs right

567
00:21:42,659 --> 00:21:45,900
I think I am uh again is the foundation

568
00:21:45,900 --> 00:21:47,880
for I am just basically trying to get

569
00:21:47,880 --> 00:21:49,380
the foundations right right either

570
00:21:49,380 --> 00:21:51,900
you're coming from a network engineer a

571
00:21:51,900 --> 00:21:53,520
system administrator or security

572
00:21:53,520 --> 00:21:56,100
adminator or an identity expert in the

573
00:21:56,100 --> 00:21:58,440
end of the day uh I I am is just part of

574
00:21:58,440 --> 00:22:00,059
the foundational pieces right because

575
00:22:00,059 --> 00:22:02,640
every login Journey starts with a user

576
00:22:02,640 --> 00:22:05,760
and the user is someone like us or a we

577
00:22:05,760 --> 00:22:07,980
type in something and the great thing is

578
00:22:07,980 --> 00:22:10,679
that technology is trying to provide

579
00:22:10,679 --> 00:22:13,500
more I would say Advanced and more user

580
00:22:13,500 --> 00:22:15,539
experience ways of providing higher

581
00:22:15,539 --> 00:22:16,919
level security Assurance right so I'm

582
00:22:16,919 --> 00:22:18,480
not sure if you guys have heard of past

583
00:22:18,480 --> 00:22:20,580
Keys that's also one thing that we're

584
00:22:20,580 --> 00:22:22,320
hearing a lot and this one is commonly

585
00:22:22,320 --> 00:22:24,480
like the UB keys I know my background

586
00:22:24,480 --> 00:22:27,900
yeah but I would say to be in I am it's

587
00:22:27,900 --> 00:22:30,299
just trying to get your hands on

588
00:22:30,299 --> 00:22:32,520
building like at least the front door of

589
00:22:32,520 --> 00:22:34,260
your system then from there you start

590
00:22:34,260 --> 00:22:35,820
from there and learn the security

591
00:22:35,820 --> 00:22:37,980
Concepts that you want to apply such

592
00:22:37,980 --> 00:22:40,440
that you can build uh Stronger ways to

593
00:22:40,440 --> 00:22:42,120
protect your app and also how can you

594
00:22:42,120 --> 00:22:45,059
also make sure that you store your I

595
00:22:45,059 --> 00:22:47,520
would say the data behind it as well

596
00:22:47,520 --> 00:22:49,559
amazing no thank you and you quite right

597
00:22:49,559 --> 00:22:52,380
it's like I love how all of us in cyber

598
00:22:52,380 --> 00:22:54,179
security love using like analogies so

599
00:22:54,179 --> 00:22:55,860
like as you said you know front door I

600
00:22:55,860 --> 00:22:57,480
am and I think it's one of those like

601
00:22:57,480 --> 00:22:59,159
really pivotal things in cyber security

602
00:22:59,159 --> 00:23:01,799
you know I'm so important and even you

603
00:23:01,799 --> 00:23:03,179
know getting more and more important I

604
00:23:03,179 --> 00:23:04,140
think as you know things are

605
00:23:04,140 --> 00:23:06,000
transitioning to the cloud

606
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:07,679
um so no lovely talk thank you so much

607
00:23:07,679 --> 00:23:09,360
you squeezed a lot of value into 15

608
00:23:09,360 --> 00:23:10,740
minutes so thank you so much for joining

609
00:23:10,740 --> 00:23:14,100
us at devsecond uh we've got our next

610
00:23:14,100 --> 00:23:16,020
um speaker lined up so I will put you to

611
00:23:16,020 --> 00:23:17,760
the backstage Jefferson thanks again for

612
00:23:17,760 --> 00:23:20,539
everything thank you
