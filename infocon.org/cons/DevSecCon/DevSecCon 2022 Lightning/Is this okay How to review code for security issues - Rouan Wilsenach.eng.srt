1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,979
let's bring up

2
00:00:01,979 --> 00:00:03,780
roll on

3
00:00:03,780 --> 00:00:06,560
hello hello

4
00:00:06,620 --> 00:00:09,260
thank you well actually first it's quiet

5
00:00:09,260 --> 00:00:11,280
we don't we don't have to do a lot

6
00:00:11,280 --> 00:00:12,420
because

7
00:00:12,420 --> 00:00:14,759
um yeah you folks are doing all the work

8
00:00:14,759 --> 00:00:16,740
excellent

9
00:00:16,740 --> 00:00:18,420
so my first question is is do you like

10
00:00:18,420 --> 00:00:22,740
pineapple pizza uh no no that's a big no

11
00:00:22,740 --> 00:00:25,580
because I don't hate myself

12
00:00:25,580 --> 00:00:28,320
no no and my Italian friends will kill

13
00:00:28,320 --> 00:00:30,000
me if I would say yes that's the second

14
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,820
thing but um

15
00:00:32,820 --> 00:00:35,520
like I want to see more now so like the

16
00:00:35,520 --> 00:00:38,040
floor is yours sir Ron take it away

17
00:00:38,040 --> 00:00:40,260
excellent I I'm afraid I I do like

18
00:00:40,260 --> 00:00:41,879
pineapple pizza so

19
00:00:41,879 --> 00:00:43,680
um I'm sorry it's my Italian friends but

20
00:00:43,680 --> 00:00:46,320
that is unfortunately the reality uh so

21
00:00:46,320 --> 00:00:48,300
my name is Ron I work for a company

22
00:00:48,300 --> 00:00:51,300
called haven um they are based in the UK

23
00:00:51,300 --> 00:00:52,559
I'm based in South Africa I'm in Sunny

24
00:00:52,559 --> 00:00:54,000
Cape Town today

25
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:55,559
and I'm very excited to be here talking

26
00:00:55,559 --> 00:00:57,480
to you about reviewing code for security

27
00:00:57,480 --> 00:00:59,879
issues and the question we want to ask

28
00:00:59,879 --> 00:01:01,620
ourselves when we look at some code is

29
00:01:01,620 --> 00:01:04,260
we want to say is this okay and as an

30
00:01:04,260 --> 00:01:05,339
engineer

31
00:01:05,339 --> 00:01:06,900
um I found this was a little bit of a

32
00:01:06,900 --> 00:01:08,159
difficult question for me to start with

33
00:01:08,159 --> 00:01:10,140
and I had to go through a little bit of

34
00:01:10,140 --> 00:01:12,180
a Learning Journey to figure out how to

35
00:01:12,180 --> 00:01:13,560
review code for potential security

36
00:01:13,560 --> 00:01:16,740
issues so my plan today is just to share

37
00:01:16,740 --> 00:01:18,299
some tips and tricks with you I've got

38
00:01:18,299 --> 00:01:20,220
eight things that you can do when you're

39
00:01:20,220 --> 00:01:22,439
busy reviewing code to try and help you

40
00:01:22,439 --> 00:01:24,900
spot security issues and so I guess

41
00:01:24,900 --> 00:01:26,759
let's hop straight in and we can have a

42
00:01:26,759 --> 00:01:29,520
look at some of those together

43
00:01:29,520 --> 00:01:32,240
first thing to say though is that

44
00:01:32,240 --> 00:01:35,100
relying on code review for caching

45
00:01:35,100 --> 00:01:37,200
security issues is a little bit too much

46
00:01:37,200 --> 00:01:39,900
pressure code reviews are fantastic for

47
00:01:39,900 --> 00:01:41,700
catching issues but they can't be the

48
00:01:41,700 --> 00:01:42,780
only thing

49
00:01:42,780 --> 00:01:45,240
So within your organization you want to

50
00:01:45,240 --> 00:01:46,619
make sure that you're building some

51
00:01:46,619 --> 00:01:47,939
awareness that people know about

52
00:01:47,939 --> 00:01:50,220
security issues know what potential

53
00:01:50,220 --> 00:01:52,500
issues might crop up that you're doing

54
00:01:52,500 --> 00:01:54,420
some threat modeling that's basically a

55
00:01:54,420 --> 00:01:55,860
process I'm sure you know already but

56
00:01:55,860 --> 00:01:57,180
it's a process of identifying what

57
00:01:57,180 --> 00:01:59,399
assets you have which ones are valuable

58
00:01:59,399 --> 00:02:01,619
to others how they might try and get to

59
00:02:01,619 --> 00:02:03,240
them and what you need to put in place

60
00:02:03,240 --> 00:02:05,579
to mitigate that happening and then

61
00:02:05,579 --> 00:02:07,380
lastly doing some penetration testing

62
00:02:07,380 --> 00:02:09,000
and I'm sure other things too but the

63
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:11,099
key Point here is you can't all rest on

64
00:02:11,099 --> 00:02:12,660
code review even though I'll show you

65
00:02:12,660 --> 00:02:14,340
some good tricks

66
00:02:14,340 --> 00:02:16,280
so the first trick I want to show you

67
00:02:16,280 --> 00:02:19,500
the first tip is to always pay attention

68
00:02:19,500 --> 00:02:21,780
to where the input is going so there are

69
00:02:21,780 --> 00:02:23,160
a few questions you want to ask yourself

70
00:02:23,160 --> 00:02:25,500
when you're busy reviewing some code and

71
00:02:25,500 --> 00:02:26,760
it's worth pointing out here that when

72
00:02:26,760 --> 00:02:28,560
we're saying reviewing code it could

73
00:02:28,560 --> 00:02:30,239
look like a few different things it

74
00:02:30,239 --> 00:02:31,800
could be you reviewing a pull request or

75
00:02:31,800 --> 00:02:34,739
a merge request from a team member it

76
00:02:34,739 --> 00:02:36,480
could be you reviewing your own code

77
00:02:36,480 --> 00:02:38,879
when or before you open your own pull

78
00:02:38,879 --> 00:02:41,760
request it could be you reviewing the

79
00:02:41,760 --> 00:02:43,260
code of a

80
00:02:43,260 --> 00:02:43,819
um

81
00:02:43,819 --> 00:02:46,019
of a peer that you're busy working with

82
00:02:46,019 --> 00:02:48,780
so all of this kind of applies

83
00:02:48,780 --> 00:02:50,160
um I don't know why my slides keep

84
00:02:50,160 --> 00:02:52,019
changing uh so there are a few questions

85
00:02:52,019 --> 00:02:53,700
you want to ask yourself

86
00:02:53,700 --> 00:02:55,019
um when you're busy looking at some

87
00:02:55,019 --> 00:02:57,480
Europe so first of all in a change set

88
00:02:57,480 --> 00:02:59,819
is there any new input

89
00:02:59,819 --> 00:03:01,920
secondly have we changed the way that

90
00:03:01,920 --> 00:03:03,720
the input is handled maybe we used to

91
00:03:03,720 --> 00:03:06,000
store it in the database and now we

92
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:07,500
store it in the database and send it on

93
00:03:07,500 --> 00:03:10,140
a message broker maybe where it's stored

94
00:03:10,140 --> 00:03:11,280
is another question that you want to ask

95
00:03:11,280 --> 00:03:13,200
so it's possible that it was stored in

96
00:03:13,200 --> 00:03:15,300
one place before and now we're restoring

97
00:03:15,300 --> 00:03:16,800
it somewhere else as well maybe we used

98
00:03:16,800 --> 00:03:18,060
to pop it in the database maybe it now

99
00:03:18,060 --> 00:03:20,760
goes in the database and in the logs and

100
00:03:20,760 --> 00:03:22,260
lastly and this is quite an interesting

101
00:03:22,260 --> 00:03:23,400
question is you've got to think about

102
00:03:23,400 --> 00:03:25,920
how it's used later so if some data

103
00:03:25,920 --> 00:03:27,780
comes in we've got some input from a

104
00:03:27,780 --> 00:03:30,000
user we know we shouldn't trust that

105
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:31,560
we're storing it but we know we're not

106
00:03:31,560 --> 00:03:34,019
using it for anything else oh but maybe

107
00:03:34,019 --> 00:03:35,819
we are and so these are the kinds of

108
00:03:35,819 --> 00:03:37,260
things that you want to keep an eye on

109
00:03:37,260 --> 00:03:40,260
for when you're busy reviewing code

110
00:03:40,260 --> 00:03:42,659
um I did a fantastic secure coding

111
00:03:42,659 --> 00:03:44,519
course through Stanford a couple of

112
00:03:44,519 --> 00:03:47,819
years ago and the key message I got is

113
00:03:47,819 --> 00:03:49,140
that the main way that people get into

114
00:03:49,140 --> 00:03:52,860
your system is by tricking you to mix uh

115
00:03:52,860 --> 00:03:56,640
data uh with instructions so the basic

116
00:03:56,640 --> 00:03:59,640
idea the picture here is is about um uh

117
00:03:59,640 --> 00:04:02,040
kind of a low level memory trick to get

118
00:04:02,040 --> 00:04:05,519
you to to have instructions in the part

119
00:04:05,519 --> 00:04:07,560
of the memory and that actually come

120
00:04:07,560 --> 00:04:09,599
from the data

121
00:04:09,599 --> 00:04:11,819
and this mixing of data and code is also

122
00:04:11,819 --> 00:04:12,540
the reason we have things like

123
00:04:12,540 --> 00:04:14,340
cross-site scripting on websites and so

124
00:04:14,340 --> 00:04:15,780
that's the thing to remember never trust

125
00:04:15,780 --> 00:04:17,579
data because someone might be tricking

126
00:04:17,579 --> 00:04:19,620
your system into using it as an

127
00:04:19,620 --> 00:04:20,820
instruction

128
00:04:20,820 --> 00:04:24,000
tip number two is are the right Triple A

129
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:26,160
checks in place so what is a triple a

130
00:04:26,160 --> 00:04:29,639
check one authentication so here we ask

131
00:04:29,639 --> 00:04:31,620
ourselves have we checked the actor is

132
00:04:31,620 --> 00:04:33,300
who they say they are so someone is

133
00:04:33,300 --> 00:04:34,620
trying to do something on your website

134
00:04:34,620 --> 00:04:36,720
or your app whatever it is

135
00:04:36,720 --> 00:04:38,100
um we have to make sure that they are

136
00:04:38,100 --> 00:04:39,780
who they say they are

137
00:04:39,780 --> 00:04:42,120
second have we checked that they're

138
00:04:42,120 --> 00:04:43,800
allowed to do this and this is quite a

139
00:04:43,800 --> 00:04:46,139
common issue that creeps into things you

140
00:04:46,139 --> 00:04:47,040
need to do some sort of permission

141
00:04:47,040 --> 00:04:48,540
checking just because someone is

142
00:04:48,540 --> 00:04:50,220
authenticated with your system doesn't

143
00:04:50,220 --> 00:04:51,300
mean that they're allowed to do

144
00:04:51,300 --> 00:04:52,740
everything that you have on offer maybe

145
00:04:52,740 --> 00:04:54,840
they're not allowed to delete a user if

146
00:04:54,840 --> 00:04:56,580
they're just a someone who has a profile

147
00:04:56,580 --> 00:04:58,979
on your website for example and lastly

148
00:04:58,979 --> 00:05:00,840
auditing and auditing will be different

149
00:05:00,840 --> 00:05:03,300
based on your company uh based on your

150
00:05:03,300 --> 00:05:05,160
team based on your requirements but

151
00:05:05,160 --> 00:05:06,960
generally for certain kinds of actions

152
00:05:06,960 --> 00:05:08,160
you want to make a note of what happened

153
00:05:08,160 --> 00:05:09,840
essentially so you want to pop something

154
00:05:09,840 --> 00:05:12,479
your logs in your database to say hey

155
00:05:12,479 --> 00:05:14,460
something happened here let's keep track

156
00:05:14,460 --> 00:05:18,120
of who did it when did they do it

157
00:05:18,120 --> 00:05:20,160
here's a little screenshot of a code

158
00:05:20,160 --> 00:05:22,500
change that's introducing an

159
00:05:22,500 --> 00:05:24,960
authorization related vulnerability so

160
00:05:24,960 --> 00:05:26,160
if you have a look here we've got three

161
00:05:26,160 --> 00:05:28,199
endpoints where people can post a

162
00:05:28,199 --> 00:05:30,120
profile there's a get to put in a post

163
00:05:30,120 --> 00:05:32,520
this this change request that we're

164
00:05:32,520 --> 00:05:34,560
looking at is adding the put endpoint

165
00:05:34,560 --> 00:05:38,460
and what you can see here is that we're

166
00:05:38,460 --> 00:05:40,080
checking if they're logged in we're

167
00:05:40,080 --> 00:05:41,699
checking if the profile is valid and

168
00:05:41,699 --> 00:05:43,680
we're updating the profile and that code

169
00:05:43,680 --> 00:05:45,900
looks fine when you're reviewing it most

170
00:05:45,900 --> 00:05:47,940
of the time but the trick here is that

171
00:05:47,940 --> 00:05:49,020
we don't have another piece of

172
00:05:49,020 --> 00:05:50,460
middleware that we have on that post

173
00:05:50,460 --> 00:05:53,220
which says user matches request and so

174
00:05:53,220 --> 00:05:55,380
with the code as it stands here we know

175
00:05:55,380 --> 00:05:57,060
that someone is logged in we know that

176
00:05:57,060 --> 00:05:59,520
they are who they say they are but we

177
00:05:59,520 --> 00:06:01,139
would allow them to update any other

178
00:06:01,139 --> 00:06:03,479
user's profile and that's problematic we

179
00:06:03,479 --> 00:06:05,220
don't want that so you've got to make

180
00:06:05,220 --> 00:06:07,020
sure that you've got those three A's

181
00:06:07,020 --> 00:06:10,979
covered when you're reviewing some code

182
00:06:10,979 --> 00:06:13,680
third have the assets changed and this

183
00:06:13,680 --> 00:06:14,940
was an interesting one to me I never

184
00:06:14,940 --> 00:06:17,580
thought about about the Assets in this

185
00:06:17,580 --> 00:06:20,160
way so let's say we have a website and

186
00:06:20,160 --> 00:06:21,780
we're storing some sort of information

187
00:06:21,780 --> 00:06:23,340
about a user

188
00:06:23,340 --> 00:06:25,500
some kinds of information you need to be

189
00:06:25,500 --> 00:06:27,120
treated differently to other kinds of

190
00:06:27,120 --> 00:06:29,400
information so two examples of that are

191
00:06:29,400 --> 00:06:32,460
personal data and payment information so

192
00:06:32,460 --> 00:06:34,500
some things just there's a the list is

193
00:06:34,500 --> 00:06:36,960
longer than this but emails health

194
00:06:36,960 --> 00:06:39,780
information credit cards racial or

195
00:06:39,780 --> 00:06:41,520
ethnic origin political or religious

196
00:06:41,520 --> 00:06:42,960
info all of these things need to be

197
00:06:42,960 --> 00:06:44,940
taken special care of and so when a pull

198
00:06:44,940 --> 00:06:47,039
request comes across your desk you

199
00:06:47,039 --> 00:06:48,960
should make sure that the shape of the

200
00:06:48,960 --> 00:06:50,699
data hasn't changed because if the shape

201
00:06:50,699 --> 00:06:53,160
of the data changes in a certain way it

202
00:06:53,160 --> 00:06:54,300
might mean that we need to treat our

203
00:06:54,300 --> 00:06:56,520
data differently so for example maybe we

204
00:06:56,520 --> 00:06:58,020
never used to care about how secure our

205
00:06:58,020 --> 00:07:00,060
database was because we weren't storing

206
00:07:00,060 --> 00:07:02,520
anything that was particularly secure

207
00:07:02,520 --> 00:07:04,020
but now all of a sudden we have user

208
00:07:04,020 --> 00:07:05,280
accounts and we have information that

209
00:07:05,280 --> 00:07:07,080
belongs to a person so we need to make

210
00:07:07,080 --> 00:07:08,520
sure that we're cracking that down on

211
00:07:08,520 --> 00:07:11,580
that more here's an example

212
00:07:11,580 --> 00:07:13,259
uh he has a pull request for our little

213
00:07:13,259 --> 00:07:15,720
profile website imagine an online dating

214
00:07:15,720 --> 00:07:17,699
profile website

215
00:07:17,699 --> 00:07:19,080
um and you can see a pull request here

216
00:07:19,080 --> 00:07:20,160
we're adding some new Fields we're

217
00:07:20,160 --> 00:07:21,900
adding ideal data

218
00:07:21,900 --> 00:07:24,780
Sunset stroll on the beach we're adding

219
00:07:24,780 --> 00:07:26,880
sexual orientation so we can match the

220
00:07:26,880 --> 00:07:28,380
right people with the right people we're

221
00:07:28,380 --> 00:07:30,560
adding favorite color and favorite food

222
00:07:30,560 --> 00:07:34,800
pizza with pineapple on it but this

223
00:07:34,800 --> 00:07:37,020
change adds sexual orientation as a

224
00:07:37,020 --> 00:07:38,580
field and sexual orientation is a

225
00:07:38,580 --> 00:07:40,259
protected piece of information in many

226
00:07:40,259 --> 00:07:42,419
parts of the world in Europe it's under

227
00:07:42,419 --> 00:07:44,819
what's called gdpr and so what that

228
00:07:44,819 --> 00:07:46,380
means is there's this protective data we

229
00:07:46,380 --> 00:07:47,940
have to take super special care of this

230
00:07:47,940 --> 00:07:50,099
data we're not even allowed to keep this

231
00:07:50,099 --> 00:07:51,840
data unless we have a very good reason

232
00:07:51,840 --> 00:07:54,360
to do so and the consent of the user and

233
00:07:54,360 --> 00:07:56,099
so that's always something to keep an

234
00:07:56,099 --> 00:07:57,539
eye out for

235
00:07:57,539 --> 00:07:59,220
all right the next thing that we want to

236
00:07:59,220 --> 00:08:01,199
look out for number four is are you

237
00:08:01,199 --> 00:08:04,500
leaking data so for this one you want to

238
00:08:04,500 --> 00:08:06,180
try and think about whether you've got

239
00:08:06,180 --> 00:08:07,979
information that you are releasing to

240
00:08:07,979 --> 00:08:09,780
other people accidentally and this

241
00:08:09,780 --> 00:08:11,099
happens more often than you might think

242
00:08:11,099 --> 00:08:13,680
the most common example is that your API

243
00:08:13,680 --> 00:08:15,780
might be returning extra bits

244
00:08:15,780 --> 00:08:17,880
so maybe you have information about a

245
00:08:17,880 --> 00:08:21,180
user but you're returning uh more than

246
00:08:21,180 --> 00:08:23,699
the pages maybe there's a page it wants

247
00:08:23,699 --> 00:08:25,919
to show a picture of the user and their

248
00:08:25,919 --> 00:08:28,080
name but we're also returning their home

249
00:08:28,080 --> 00:08:30,120
address whoops that's not great because

250
00:08:30,120 --> 00:08:31,860
then attackers can use that to get extra

251
00:08:31,860 --> 00:08:34,380
information about your customers

252
00:08:34,380 --> 00:08:36,059
second one that happens quite commonly

253
00:08:36,059 --> 00:08:38,339
is are you logging stuff that you

254
00:08:38,339 --> 00:08:39,719
shouldn't so maybe you're logging

255
00:08:39,719 --> 00:08:41,520
personal information which isn't great

256
00:08:41,520 --> 00:08:42,719
because normally the kinds of

257
00:08:42,719 --> 00:08:43,979
protections that you put on your

258
00:08:43,979 --> 00:08:45,240
database to make sure that you're not

259
00:08:45,240 --> 00:08:47,100
leaking personal information are not the

260
00:08:47,100 --> 00:08:49,440
same ones that you put on your logs

261
00:08:49,440 --> 00:08:50,940
um maybe you're logging something like a

262
00:08:50,940 --> 00:08:52,800
bearer token when an authentication

263
00:08:52,800 --> 00:08:54,660
request fails to a third party and now

264
00:08:54,660 --> 00:08:57,720
you've got secrets in your logs and a

265
00:08:57,720 --> 00:08:59,040
nice little trick to keep in mind to

266
00:08:59,040 --> 00:09:00,180
make sure that you're not leaking any

267
00:09:00,180 --> 00:09:03,180
data is to make sure that you don't keep

268
00:09:03,180 --> 00:09:05,399
anything that you don't need if you

269
00:09:05,399 --> 00:09:08,760
don't have it you can't leak it

270
00:09:08,760 --> 00:09:12,060
right here's a little trick as well it's

271
00:09:12,060 --> 00:09:13,680
super helpful to make sure that your API

272
00:09:13,680 --> 00:09:15,360
stay a little bit more secure you can

273
00:09:15,360 --> 00:09:17,339
see here that we've got a profile object

274
00:09:17,339 --> 00:09:18,779
and what we're doing is we're pulling

275
00:09:18,779 --> 00:09:20,640
off the first name and the Avatar URL

276
00:09:20,640 --> 00:09:22,560
from that and we're sending that back to

277
00:09:22,560 --> 00:09:25,140
our client very simple but in most cases

278
00:09:25,140 --> 00:09:27,600
a lot of Engineers will return the whole

279
00:09:27,600 --> 00:09:30,000
profile and having this kind of allow

280
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:31,380
list of fields that we want to send back

281
00:09:31,380 --> 00:09:33,060
to our clients is a very simple trick

282
00:09:33,060 --> 00:09:35,100
Keeps Us nice and safe and is a good

283
00:09:35,100 --> 00:09:36,899
thing to keep an eye out for when you're

284
00:09:36,899 --> 00:09:38,940
busy reviewing code

285
00:09:38,940 --> 00:09:41,220
okay next one

286
00:09:41,220 --> 00:09:43,560
are there any new dependencies and this

287
00:09:43,560 --> 00:09:45,360
is a particularly Hot Topic at the

288
00:09:45,360 --> 00:09:46,980
moment due to something called a supply

289
00:09:46,980 --> 00:09:48,720
chain attacks and so the idea is that

290
00:09:48,720 --> 00:09:50,640
someone is going to inject scary code

291
00:09:50,640 --> 00:09:52,080
into your application but they're going

292
00:09:52,080 --> 00:09:53,940
to do it quite far away from your actual

293
00:09:53,940 --> 00:09:56,220
code and dependencies are one way in

294
00:09:56,220 --> 00:09:58,200
which they can do this so when you're

295
00:09:58,200 --> 00:09:59,459
looking at a new dependency if a pull

296
00:09:59,459 --> 00:10:02,040
request comes across your desk and there

297
00:10:02,040 --> 00:10:04,680
is a new entry into a package.json or

298
00:10:04,680 --> 00:10:06,839
whatever package manager you're using

299
00:10:06,839 --> 00:10:08,820
ask yourself do a little bit of research

300
00:10:08,820 --> 00:10:12,300
is the library trusted is it popular is

301
00:10:12,300 --> 00:10:15,000
it well maintained and lastly do you

302
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:16,380
really need it maybe you can do it with

303
00:10:16,380 --> 00:10:19,140
some plain code without a dependency at

304
00:10:19,140 --> 00:10:20,399
all

305
00:10:20,399 --> 00:10:22,560
here's an example of from a pull request

306
00:10:22,560 --> 00:10:26,100
that I opened up against an application

307
00:10:26,100 --> 00:10:27,839
um an open source Library a number of

308
00:10:27,839 --> 00:10:29,940
years ago and there was a this is a

309
00:10:29,940 --> 00:10:31,980
JavaScript application and you can see

310
00:10:31,980 --> 00:10:33,120
that there's a package that was there

311
00:10:33,120 --> 00:10:36,540
called net and net is a built-in node

312
00:10:36,540 --> 00:10:37,260
um

313
00:10:37,260 --> 00:10:40,019
library and so in your application you

314
00:10:40,019 --> 00:10:42,540
can say import net from net and it just

315
00:10:42,540 --> 00:10:44,220
works you don't need a dependency for

316
00:10:44,220 --> 00:10:46,740
that but somehow this is script into the

317
00:10:46,740 --> 00:10:51,240
code and net was a real package on npm I

318
00:10:51,240 --> 00:10:53,399
didn't have a lot of uh information

319
00:10:53,399 --> 00:10:55,440
about it there wasn't any code there

320
00:10:55,440 --> 00:10:57,240
really it looked like but you could see

321
00:10:57,240 --> 00:10:58,860
how that squatting on a name like that

322
00:10:58,860 --> 00:11:01,800
would allow someone to inject malicious

323
00:11:01,800 --> 00:11:03,959
code into your application so I opened a

324
00:11:03,959 --> 00:11:05,160
pull request to remove it in this case

325
00:11:05,160 --> 00:11:06,480
but this is a really great thing to keep

326
00:11:06,480 --> 00:11:07,980
an eye out for you want to make sure

327
00:11:07,980 --> 00:11:11,339
that any new dependency is sound

328
00:11:11,339 --> 00:11:14,660
next up has the config changed

329
00:11:14,660 --> 00:11:17,640
misconfiguration is a super common cause

330
00:11:17,640 --> 00:11:20,220
of security issues

331
00:11:20,220 --> 00:11:23,040
most of that's probably an exaggeration

332
00:11:23,040 --> 00:11:25,079
lots and lots and lots of examples that

333
00:11:25,079 --> 00:11:27,000
you see in the news of information

334
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:30,240
getting leaked of security hacks or due

335
00:11:30,240 --> 00:11:32,579
to misconfiguration it's very very easy

336
00:11:32,579 --> 00:11:35,040
to make a misconfiguration issue you can

337
00:11:35,040 --> 00:11:36,779
see from the screenshot there Microsoft

338
00:11:36,779 --> 00:11:38,760
had a bit of a whoopsie and they lost

339
00:11:38,760 --> 00:11:41,459
250 million customer service records due

340
00:11:41,459 --> 00:11:43,440
to some just a checkbox on a database

341
00:11:43,440 --> 00:11:45,060
really right should this be secured yes

342
00:11:45,060 --> 00:11:47,820
or no didn't tick the Box a really

343
00:11:47,820 --> 00:11:49,980
really helpful trick here is that to

344
00:11:49,980 --> 00:11:52,320
remember that if your code your if your

345
00:11:52,320 --> 00:11:55,140
conflict isn't code you can't review it

346
00:11:55,140 --> 00:11:57,000
so make a real effort to have your

347
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:58,860
infrastructure defined as code your

348
00:11:58,860 --> 00:12:00,600
configuration as code because then

349
00:12:00,600 --> 00:12:03,600
changes to configuration can be reviewed

350
00:12:03,600 --> 00:12:05,880
a couple of years ago there were a lot

351
00:12:05,880 --> 00:12:08,100
of issues with people not securing their

352
00:12:08,100 --> 00:12:11,040
Amazon AWS S3 buckets you can see that

353
00:12:11,040 --> 00:12:12,959
little red uh exclamation mark they're

354
00:12:12,959 --> 00:12:15,060
saying with Public Access blocking is

355
00:12:15,060 --> 00:12:17,339
off whoops suddenly all of your

356
00:12:17,339 --> 00:12:19,140
customers information is available to

357
00:12:19,140 --> 00:12:20,820
anyone who's clever enough to find it

358
00:12:20,820 --> 00:12:22,560
not great make sure that things are

359
00:12:22,560 --> 00:12:24,180
locked down

360
00:12:24,180 --> 00:12:26,040
number seven this is our second last one

361
00:12:26,040 --> 00:12:29,040
ask yourself if anything is being cached

362
00:12:29,040 --> 00:12:31,200
the reason this is really important is

363
00:12:31,200 --> 00:12:33,019
particularly when dealing with

364
00:12:33,019 --> 00:12:35,279
user-specific information if your

365
00:12:35,279 --> 00:12:37,440
caching is wrong you're going to show

366
00:12:37,440 --> 00:12:40,740
Susan's information to tando and that is

367
00:12:40,740 --> 00:12:42,360
going to be a problem because you've

368
00:12:42,360 --> 00:12:43,980
cached it when Susan was busy looking at

369
00:12:43,980 --> 00:12:46,320
hers and it's really important that

370
00:12:46,320 --> 00:12:48,120
everyone in your organization when they

371
00:12:48,120 --> 00:12:49,320
are reviewing pull requests and when

372
00:12:49,320 --> 00:12:51,360
they're writing code understands the

373
00:12:51,360 --> 00:12:53,519
default cash behavior and it's really

374
00:12:53,519 --> 00:12:56,760
helpful to have good cash Keys as well

375
00:12:56,760 --> 00:12:58,740
number eight this is the last trick if

376
00:12:58,740 --> 00:13:00,959
you're short on time if you don't have

377
00:13:00,959 --> 00:13:03,839
the um the time to look everything in a

378
00:13:03,839 --> 00:13:06,360
pull request the handy trick is to focus

379
00:13:06,360 --> 00:13:08,700
on where the data enters and leaves your

380
00:13:08,700 --> 00:13:10,920
systems check the borders so if you're

381
00:13:10,920 --> 00:13:12,240
having a web request that you're dealing

382
00:13:12,240 --> 00:13:13,980
with have a look at what data is coming

383
00:13:13,980 --> 00:13:16,139
in when we put it into a database or put

384
00:13:16,139 --> 00:13:17,760
it on a queue have a look at what data

385
00:13:17,760 --> 00:13:19,440
is leaving so those are the two most

386
00:13:19,440 --> 00:13:21,180
important places to start when you're

387
00:13:21,180 --> 00:13:24,480
reviewing a code for security issues

388
00:13:24,480 --> 00:13:26,940
I'm going to share a few tips really

389
00:13:26,940 --> 00:13:28,380
quickly

390
00:13:28,380 --> 00:13:29,940
um that have helped me learn a lot about

391
00:13:29,940 --> 00:13:32,220
secure coding the first thing is to find

392
00:13:32,220 --> 00:13:33,959
yourself a security Mentor find someone

393
00:13:33,959 --> 00:13:35,820
who knows more about security than you

394
00:13:35,820 --> 00:13:38,040
do ask them questions hear what they

395
00:13:38,040 --> 00:13:39,720
have to say see who they follow on

396
00:13:39,720 --> 00:13:41,880
social media and just try and get a bit

397
00:13:41,880 --> 00:13:44,459
closer to what's going on secondly if at

398
00:13:44,459 --> 00:13:45,660
your company you have things called

399
00:13:45,660 --> 00:13:47,519
postmortems when there are security

400
00:13:47,519 --> 00:13:50,100
issues turn up to those learn about them

401
00:13:50,100 --> 00:13:52,740
read the notes see what went wrong

402
00:13:52,740 --> 00:13:55,680
and see if you can learn from it

403
00:13:55,680 --> 00:13:57,540
I also started listening to a podcast

404
00:13:57,540 --> 00:14:00,180
called smashing security it's amazing

405
00:14:00,180 --> 00:14:02,760
it's not a particularly technical con uh

406
00:14:02,760 --> 00:14:04,860
podcast it's just a very entertaining

407
00:14:04,860 --> 00:14:06,360
one and people talk about all kinds of

408
00:14:06,360 --> 00:14:08,639
things that go wrong with I don't know

409
00:14:08,639 --> 00:14:10,620
smart fridges being hacked and things

410
00:14:10,620 --> 00:14:12,000
like that and it's just kind of like a

411
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:13,620
funny take and kind of gets you thinking

412
00:14:13,620 --> 00:14:14,660
about security

413
00:14:14,660 --> 00:14:17,339
and the next one here is to offer help

414
00:14:17,339 --> 00:14:19,380
during pen tests pen tests can be

415
00:14:19,380 --> 00:14:20,459
difficult to organize their

416
00:14:20,459 --> 00:14:22,260
organizations so it's really helpful if

417
00:14:22,260 --> 00:14:24,180
there's an engineer there saying hey I'm

418
00:14:24,180 --> 00:14:25,620
willing to help

419
00:14:25,620 --> 00:14:27,959
um I'm happy to help you talk to all the

420
00:14:27,959 --> 00:14:29,399
team leads and figure out what needs to

421
00:14:29,399 --> 00:14:30,720
be tested and when because then you can

422
00:14:30,720 --> 00:14:32,339
kind of get close to the action and

423
00:14:32,339 --> 00:14:33,660
lastly find a good security course

424
00:14:33,660 --> 00:14:35,339
online there are a few of them maybe one

425
00:14:35,339 --> 00:14:36,600
specific to the language that you're

426
00:14:36,600 --> 00:14:39,720
coding in most of the time

427
00:14:39,720 --> 00:14:42,540
all right and a quick recap before I

428
00:14:42,540 --> 00:14:44,220
finish up these are the eight things you

429
00:14:44,220 --> 00:14:46,440
want to keep an eye on check your inputs

430
00:14:46,440 --> 00:14:48,300
make sure you got the right Triple H X

431
00:14:48,300 --> 00:14:50,820
check your asset type has it changed

432
00:14:50,820 --> 00:14:52,620
make sure you're not leaking any data

433
00:14:52,620 --> 00:14:54,060
that you shouldn't have shouldn't be

434
00:14:54,060 --> 00:14:56,100
leaking check the dependencies to make

435
00:14:56,100 --> 00:14:58,260
sure they're not dodgy make sure your

436
00:14:58,260 --> 00:15:00,600
configuration is code that there aren't

437
00:15:00,600 --> 00:15:03,180
any bad changes make sure that you

438
00:15:03,180 --> 00:15:05,519
understand your caching rules and that

439
00:15:05,519 --> 00:15:07,860
those are all okay and being respected

440
00:15:07,860 --> 00:15:09,120
and that you're not going to leak one

441
00:15:09,120 --> 00:15:11,040
person's information to another one and

442
00:15:11,040 --> 00:15:13,019
lastly check those boundaries those are

443
00:15:13,019 --> 00:15:14,339
the main places where you want to have a

444
00:15:14,339 --> 00:15:16,019
look so that's everything that I wanted

445
00:15:16,019 --> 00:15:18,240
to tell you today if there's time I'm

446
00:15:18,240 --> 00:15:19,800
happy to answer some questions otherwise

447
00:15:19,800 --> 00:15:22,939
you can catch me online later

448
00:15:23,399 --> 00:15:27,300
wow thanks that was like super concise

449
00:15:27,300 --> 00:15:30,540
super actionable and and very very much

450
00:15:30,540 --> 00:15:32,880
I got got some questions or not not

451
00:15:32,880 --> 00:15:34,500
basically not questions but just remarks

452
00:15:34,500 --> 00:15:36,899
like great talk useful useful advice so

453
00:15:36,899 --> 00:15:41,180
uh people love it and I think uh this is

454
00:15:41,180 --> 00:15:44,040
like this is The Benchmark what it what

455
00:15:44,040 --> 00:15:45,779
a lightning talk should do and if you

456
00:15:45,779 --> 00:15:47,880
put that in 15 minutes I mean great job

457
00:15:47,880 --> 00:15:49,880
man um

458
00:15:49,880 --> 00:15:53,160
this there's so much so uh um I am sure

459
00:15:53,160 --> 00:15:55,740
that when the video goes up uh because

460
00:15:55,740 --> 00:15:57,720
we record every basically are recording

461
00:15:57,720 --> 00:16:00,060
everything comes up it will be a Smasher

462
00:16:00,060 --> 00:16:01,880
and people will share it uh right away

463
00:16:01,880 --> 00:16:05,040
first of all I wanna I wanna bring in uh

464
00:16:05,040 --> 00:16:08,699
my my fellow sneak person well basically

465
00:16:08,699 --> 00:16:10,079
um I have to be kind to him because he's

466
00:16:10,079 --> 00:16:13,459
my manager hyaluron

467
00:16:16,220 --> 00:16:18,600
for the last part of this this thing

468
00:16:18,600 --> 00:16:20,639
you're taking over so um I would say

469
00:16:20,639 --> 00:16:22,440
Matt Laurent

470
00:16:22,440 --> 00:16:25,019
um yeah I've got the better co-host now

471
00:16:25,019 --> 00:16:27,019
so well thank you

472
00:16:27,019 --> 00:16:29,760
oh I appreciate it looks better now

473
00:16:29,760 --> 00:16:32,960
right Matt hey um you know what bye

474
00:16:32,960 --> 00:16:34,380
[Laughter]

475
00:16:34,380 --> 00:16:36,600
thank you Brian oh you're out this

476
00:16:36,600 --> 00:16:38,940
morning it's been uh awesome and thank

477
00:16:38,940 --> 00:16:42,000
you uh Rowan uh we'll let you go um if

478
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:43,920
uh we we need to move on unfortunately

479
00:16:43,920 --> 00:16:46,920
but uh if um if folks have questions to

480
00:16:46,920 --> 00:16:50,459
run I'm sure you can uh uh either uh get

481
00:16:50,459 --> 00:16:52,980
on the Discord which I'll put on screen

482
00:16:52,980 --> 00:16:55,199
again oh no that's the wrong one

483
00:16:55,199 --> 00:16:57,540
it's this one

484
00:16:57,540 --> 00:17:00,779
um and or or contact you offline right
