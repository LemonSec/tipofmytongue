00:01:16,619 --> 00:01:18,240
hi

29
00:01:18,240 --> 00:01:19,740

your mouth is not moving I was going to

35
00:01:32,880 --> 00:01:35,520
say that as long as you can hear me I

36
00:01:35,520 --> 00:01:37,320
think that people can appreciate that I

37
00:01:37,320 --> 00:01:39,659
guess so this is the joys of working on

38
00:01:39,659 --> 00:01:41,939
a crappy internet I guess today but uh I

39
00:01:41,939 --> 00:01:43,740

40
00:01:43,740 --> 00:01:45,119

apj region for devsecond lightning which

56
00:02:21,239 --> 00:02:22,560
is my home region I'm based out of

57
00:02:22,560 --> 00:02:24,780
Melbourne Australia and as kavika

58
00:02:24,780 --> 00:02:27,500
mentioned the talk for today is is 2023

59
00:02:27,500 --> 00:02:31,860
and there is still no devsecops so I'm

60
00:02:31,860 --> 00:02:33,599
gonna go well let's say I'll get still

61
00:02:33,599 --> 00:02:35,640
trading it's pretty good so the first

62
00:02:35,640 --> 00:02:37,620
basically who am I uh for folks who

63
00:02:37,620 --> 00:02:40,080
don't know who I am uh my name is Ashish

64
00:02:40,080 --> 00:02:42,239
and I have been a cyber security space

65
00:02:42,239 --> 00:02:44,040
for a long time as was mentioned by

66
00:02:44,040 --> 00:02:45,120
kavika

67
00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:47,220
or from an academic perspective or did a

68
00:02:47,220 --> 00:02:49,200
masters in cyber security I was a sea

69
00:02:49,200 --> 00:02:52,260
surgeon before and for the past uh three

70
00:02:52,260 --> 00:02:55,140
and a half years outside of my regular

71
00:02:55,140 --> 00:02:56,819
day job I've also been running a podcast

72
00:02:56,819 --> 00:02:58,620
from cloud security podcast which is

73
00:02:58,620 --> 00:03:02,099
ranked top 100 in US UK Australia and I

74
00:03:02,099 --> 00:03:04,140
think uh France as well as of last week

75
00:03:04,140 --> 00:03:07,440
outside of all of this I also had just

76
00:03:07,440 --> 00:03:08,700
happened to love men's fashion and

77
00:03:08,700 --> 00:03:11,220
coffee is my thing and another on the

78
00:03:11,220 --> 00:03:12,900
personal my dog's right behind me as

79
00:03:12,900 --> 00:03:13,860
well so hopefully he doesn't start

80
00:03:13,860 --> 00:03:16,080
working uh that's my fingers crossed for

81
00:03:16,080 --> 00:03:18,120
that as well so good luck with my talk

82
00:03:18,120 --> 00:03:19,260
all right

83
00:03:19,260 --> 00:03:22,800
the so for this keynote what I had in

84
00:03:22,800 --> 00:03:25,319
mind was to explain to people I guess

85
00:03:25,319 --> 00:03:27,540
after running towards like Jeff steckos

86
00:03:27,540 --> 00:03:29,519
has been a concept since 2009 for people

87
00:03:29,519 --> 00:03:31,920
who have been there in the beginning I

88
00:03:31,920 --> 00:03:33,720
used to run a devsecos Melbourne meter

89
00:03:33,720 --> 00:03:36,360
which you still do and the idea behind

90
00:03:36,360 --> 00:03:38,099
that was hey you know give it another

91
00:03:38,099 --> 00:03:39,780
three four years and everyone would have

92
00:03:39,780 --> 00:03:42,120
the answer for it it's like going out to

93
00:03:42,120 --> 00:03:44,280
to the gym to work out and expecting you

94
00:03:44,280 --> 00:03:46,080
have abs off at the end of six months

95
00:03:46,080 --> 00:03:48,239
how many of us I'm sure some of you did

96
00:03:48,239 --> 00:03:50,280
but not everyone got abs straight after

97
00:03:50,280 --> 00:03:52,159
the six months of workout I think

98
00:03:52,159 --> 00:03:54,180
devsecops kind of became like a similar

99
00:03:54,180 --> 00:03:57,659
thing where it got muddied in the

100
00:03:57,659 --> 00:03:59,400
different definitions that existed there

101
00:03:59,400 --> 00:04:01,739
are roles for devsecops that exist in

102
00:04:01,739 --> 00:04:04,440
most organizations these days for people

103
00:04:04,440 --> 00:04:06,299
who don't know this but devsecos are

104
00:04:06,299 --> 00:04:08,519
supposed to be a framework where it's a

105
00:04:08,519 --> 00:04:10,560
way of working where development as well

106
00:04:10,560 --> 00:04:12,599
as the operations team can work together

107
00:04:12,599 --> 00:04:15,239
but it wasn't supposed to be like a

108
00:04:15,239 --> 00:04:17,339
death Cyclops engineer or a devsecops

109
00:04:17,339 --> 00:04:19,918
consultant but humans being humans we

110
00:04:19,918 --> 00:04:22,680
figured out a way to I guess ruin

111
00:04:22,680 --> 00:04:25,080
something uh for lack of whatever and as

112
00:04:25,080 --> 00:04:29,520
as was mentioned earlier that I am a bit

113
00:04:29,520 --> 00:04:31,800
brutally honest about most topics uh you

114
00:04:31,800 --> 00:04:33,660
might find that my definition of desktop

115
00:04:33,660 --> 00:04:35,580
was very almost a bit bit more purest

116
00:04:35,580 --> 00:04:37,740
but it is kind of what the idea was it's

117
00:04:37,740 --> 00:04:39,660
a it's a framework defined for how can

118
00:04:39,660 --> 00:04:41,580
we work together as a

119
00:04:41,580 --> 00:04:44,220
community of developers and operations

120
00:04:44,220 --> 00:04:46,080
and kind of including security in there

121
00:04:46,080 --> 00:04:48,600
became the whole devsecos model now I've

122
00:04:48,600 --> 00:04:50,759
already called out the fact that the the

123
00:04:50,759 --> 00:04:52,919
biggest Advantage for folks who have

124
00:04:52,919 --> 00:04:54,660
been in the industry for a long time and

125
00:04:54,660 --> 00:04:56,880
like myself or maybe even longer you

126
00:04:56,880 --> 00:04:58,800
would remember waterfall method and how

127
00:04:58,800 --> 00:05:01,020
we would wait six months or maybe one

128
00:05:01,020 --> 00:05:02,460
year sometimes for a project to finish

129
00:05:02,460 --> 00:05:04,800
before we even know that hey are we

130
00:05:04,800 --> 00:05:06,479
building the right thing and is that

131
00:05:06,479 --> 00:05:09,180
still relevant devsecops was that answer

132
00:05:09,180 --> 00:05:11,220
to hey how can you get quicker feedback

133
00:05:11,220 --> 00:05:13,560
loop for if I made something for

134
00:05:13,560 --> 00:05:15,960
something for an entire month the entire

135
00:05:15,960 --> 00:05:18,120
shareholder that are responsible for

136
00:05:18,120 --> 00:05:19,919
funding the project are they happy with

137
00:05:19,919 --> 00:05:21,900
where the project is going or are they

138
00:05:21,900 --> 00:05:23,940
even happy with the direction that

139
00:05:23,940 --> 00:05:25,560
you're going in that was kind of the

140
00:05:25,560 --> 00:05:27,780
motivation for it some of the components

141
00:05:27,780 --> 00:05:29,580
that people would hear about and if this

142
00:05:29,580 --> 00:05:30,780
is the first time you're hearing about

143
00:05:30,780 --> 00:05:32,340
deaf psychops I'll definitely encourage

144
00:05:32,340 --> 00:05:34,380
you to Google these uh acronyms that I

145
00:05:34,380 --> 00:05:37,440
call out cicd uh continuous integration

146
00:05:37,440 --> 00:05:39,120
countries deployment agile practices

147
00:05:39,120 --> 00:05:40,860
which is your successor to Waterfall

148
00:05:40,860 --> 00:05:43,259
methodology and basically appsec

149
00:05:43,259 --> 00:05:47,160
checkpoints like your test that's SCA

150
00:05:47,160 --> 00:05:49,139
and the whole secret management and then

151
00:05:49,139 --> 00:05:51,000
the list goes on that was kind of like

152
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:53,639
the main foundational pieces for what

153
00:05:53,639 --> 00:05:55,919
devsecops is supposed to be in terms of

154
00:05:55,919 --> 00:05:58,320
holistically again this is a 10 000 feet

155
00:05:58,320 --> 00:06:00,539
picture but you can go deep dive into

156
00:06:00,539 --> 00:06:03,060
some of these as well

157
00:06:03,060 --> 00:06:04,680
now

158
00:06:04,680 --> 00:06:06,600
the next slide I wanted to kind of call

159
00:06:06,600 --> 00:06:10,080
out is for 2023 and we still have a

160
00:06:10,080 --> 00:06:13,259
vision for why haven't we done devsecops

161
00:06:13,259 --> 00:06:16,020
so far why are we still stuck with uh

162
00:06:16,020 --> 00:06:18,240
devsecops uh consultant or desktop

163
00:06:18,240 --> 00:06:20,699
engineer role what what's stopping some

164
00:06:20,699 --> 00:06:22,680
of these now if you were to just go on

165
00:06:22,680 --> 00:06:24,300
the internet and just Google for hey

166
00:06:24,300 --> 00:06:27,180
what do I look for when I do devsecops

167
00:06:27,180 --> 00:06:28,800
you get these beautiful pictures where

168
00:06:28,800 --> 00:06:30,419
it looks almost I love the one on the

169
00:06:30,419 --> 00:06:32,039
right where it's almost like a straight

170
00:06:32,039 --> 00:06:34,500
path you you start with the planning you

171
00:06:34,500 --> 00:06:37,080
go into the code phase you build it and

172
00:06:37,080 --> 00:06:38,819
by the time you get to deploy and you

173
00:06:38,819 --> 00:06:40,919
operate it you're you're looking at

174
00:06:40,919 --> 00:06:43,380
something which is very I mean fairly

175
00:06:43,380 --> 00:06:45,000
straightforward right even the one the

176
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:46,440
left-hand side as well looks like a very

177
00:06:46,440 --> 00:06:48,419
fairly straightforward Drive where you

178
00:06:48,419 --> 00:06:50,699
have the devops component and you're

179
00:06:50,699 --> 00:06:52,199
doing continuous delivery you're using

180
00:06:52,199 --> 00:06:55,080
agile methodology to create beautiful

181
00:06:55,080 --> 00:06:57,360
products that have been uh tightly

182
00:06:57,360 --> 00:06:59,160
feedback loop and everything

183
00:06:59,160 --> 00:07:00,360
now

184
00:07:00,360 --> 00:07:02,520
if you go a bit deeper and try and find

185
00:07:02,520 --> 00:07:04,860
out what kind of tooling you can use for

186
00:07:04,860 --> 00:07:06,479
this as well engineer will tell you that

187
00:07:06,479 --> 00:07:08,639
hey each one of these components you can

188
00:07:08,639 --> 00:07:10,440
have some of these things in there you

189
00:07:10,440 --> 00:07:12,840
can have all these tools that you can

190
00:07:12,840 --> 00:07:14,280
actually work with

191
00:07:14,280 --> 00:07:15,960
now this is what the internet is saying

192
00:07:15,960 --> 00:07:18,240
now let me show you what the reality of

193
00:07:18,240 --> 00:07:20,699
working in Dev psychopsis

194
00:07:20,699 --> 00:07:23,340
if if you are someone who's tried doing

195
00:07:23,340 --> 00:07:25,080
devsecops in an organization you

196
00:07:25,080 --> 00:07:27,000
probably would realize this is a harsh

197
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:29,520
reality of doing Dev Cyclops in most

198
00:07:29,520 --> 00:07:32,580
organizations where each component of

199
00:07:32,580 --> 00:07:34,620
our software development lifecycle these

200
00:07:34,620 --> 00:07:37,020
days is filled with multitude of

201
00:07:37,020 --> 00:07:40,319
languages multitude of tools multitude

202
00:07:40,319 --> 00:07:42,720
of uh different opinions of people who

203
00:07:42,720 --> 00:07:44,280
want to work deaf psychos who don't

204
00:07:44,280 --> 00:07:46,919
monitor work desktop devsecops we also

205
00:07:46,919 --> 00:07:48,840
have the challenge of whether the

206
00:07:48,840 --> 00:07:51,000
business is ready to fund the death

207
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:52,919
cycle of exercise as well because it is

208
00:07:52,919 --> 00:07:55,800
not as straightforward as or as she is

209
00:07:55,800 --> 00:07:57,360
just going to do his job and it would

210
00:07:57,360 --> 00:08:00,000
all work out or someone else or the

211
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:01,620
Seesaw she's gonna try and figure out

212
00:08:01,620 --> 00:08:03,599
how can I implement this and it would

213
00:08:03,599 --> 00:08:06,240
just happen there is a cost

214
00:08:06,240 --> 00:08:08,699
implementation on both the security side

215
00:08:08,699 --> 00:08:10,199
as well as the development side because

216
00:08:10,199 --> 00:08:11,580
someone on the other hand has to spend

217
00:08:11,580 --> 00:08:13,620
some time on this as well which is away

218
00:08:13,620 --> 00:08:16,199
from their regular day job and then you

219
00:08:16,199 --> 00:08:20,160
can go into the question of well if I'm

220
00:08:20,160 --> 00:08:21,599
just going to use the two ladies over

221
00:08:21,599 --> 00:08:23,699
there on the call earlier if kavika and

222
00:08:23,699 --> 00:08:27,599
Sheltie are the developers and they on a

223
00:08:27,599 --> 00:08:29,340
day-to-day basis develop amazing

224
00:08:29,340 --> 00:08:32,279
products but I'm going in as a season

225
00:08:32,279 --> 00:08:34,020
asking them hey we want to do deaf

226
00:08:34,020 --> 00:08:36,000
sec-offs can you leave what you're doing

227
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:39,120
and do devsecops and I'll give you sneak

228
00:08:39,120 --> 00:08:40,860
as a tool and you can integrate that to

229
00:08:40,860 --> 00:08:43,440
GitHub and you know all work out

230
00:08:43,440 --> 00:08:45,180
you can imagine for folks who are

231
00:08:45,180 --> 00:08:48,480
already in a Workforce your day-to-day

232
00:08:48,480 --> 00:08:51,180
is pretty busy already and if you are

233
00:08:51,180 --> 00:08:54,240
trying to add more work to people they

234
00:08:54,240 --> 00:08:57,540
would try and resist the the need to do

235
00:08:57,540 --> 00:08:59,279
extra work and not because they don't

236
00:08:59,279 --> 00:09:00,720
want you or not that because they don't

237
00:09:00,720 --> 00:09:02,640
care about security but from a simple

238
00:09:02,640 --> 00:09:04,980
component of the fact that they're just

239
00:09:04,980 --> 00:09:07,440
not enough time which means someone on

240
00:09:07,440 --> 00:09:09,480
the development side has to spend either

241
00:09:09,480 --> 00:09:12,180
lose money by asking shilpi and kavika

242
00:09:12,180 --> 00:09:14,160
to not work on the product and do the

243
00:09:14,160 --> 00:09:16,440
security thing so if someone is paying

244
00:09:16,440 --> 00:09:17,820
somewhere or some money is being lost

245
00:09:17,820 --> 00:09:20,220
somewhere now that's the uh people

246
00:09:20,220 --> 00:09:22,260
process side the other side is from a

247
00:09:22,260 --> 00:09:24,540
tooling perspective most organizations

248
00:09:24,540 --> 00:09:28,560
that are probably in this industry for a

249
00:09:28,560 --> 00:09:29,880
long time

250
00:09:29,880 --> 00:09:32,040
if you have been an ID for over 50 years

251
00:09:32,040 --> 00:09:34,320
you have some Legacy code by Legacy code

252
00:09:34,320 --> 00:09:35,760
what I mean is

253
00:09:35,760 --> 00:09:37,980
languages that are really old and

254
00:09:37,980 --> 00:09:42,180
obsolete uh I'm thinking PHP uh some

255
00:09:42,180 --> 00:09:43,980
some people were writing quotes in Pearl

256
00:09:43,980 --> 00:09:45,720
which is still fairly new but people

257
00:09:45,720 --> 00:09:48,060
were writing in Java there are a lot of

258
00:09:48,060 --> 00:09:50,760
these components which are com which is

259
00:09:50,760 --> 00:09:52,740
which is what makes your product and

260
00:09:52,740 --> 00:09:54,540
what you end up with is in an

261
00:09:54,540 --> 00:09:56,220
organization sometimes the application

262
00:09:56,220 --> 00:09:59,399
that you are thinking of I guess quote

263
00:09:59,399 --> 00:10:01,980
unquote devbox Dev Stack Up spying is

264
00:10:01,980 --> 00:10:03,899
that if that could be a word uh if

265
00:10:03,899 --> 00:10:05,880
you're trying to do a devsecops in any

266
00:10:05,880 --> 00:10:08,339
application using that framework to

267
00:10:08,339 --> 00:10:10,620
build the two builds together you might

268
00:10:10,620 --> 00:10:12,360
realize that devops is not really a

269
00:10:12,360 --> 00:10:13,440
thing because it's a really old

270
00:10:13,440 --> 00:10:15,600
application you can't automate you can't

271
00:10:15,600 --> 00:10:17,339
get feedback loops you have to basically

272
00:10:17,339 --> 00:10:19,440
use a traditional way of knowing exactly

273
00:10:19,440 --> 00:10:21,000
what you're putting in

274
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:23,279
now that's the reality of a lot of the

275
00:10:23,279 --> 00:10:25,320
components that are going in there

276
00:10:25,320 --> 00:10:27,300
which kind of brings me to

277
00:10:27,300 --> 00:10:30,720
well as a c so I had a personal

278
00:10:30,720 --> 00:10:32,519
experience where

279
00:10:32,519 --> 00:10:34,620
I tried doing that suck-ups in an

280
00:10:34,620 --> 00:10:36,779
organization and I failed

281
00:10:36,779 --> 00:10:38,760
um and I feel this is a face safe face

282
00:10:38,760 --> 00:10:40,740
to talk about it so I'm gonna kind of

283
00:10:40,740 --> 00:10:42,779
start some of the things that I found

284
00:10:42,779 --> 00:10:44,519
well maybe let me start with my first

285
00:10:44,519 --> 00:10:45,959
experience and I can talk about why

286
00:10:45,959 --> 00:10:48,360
other csos that I've spoken to talk

287
00:10:48,360 --> 00:10:50,880
about why does the cost fails so for me

288
00:10:50,880 --> 00:10:53,640
personally or we didn't have a resource

289
00:10:53,640 --> 00:10:56,880
in the team for doing uh I guess just

290
00:10:56,880 --> 00:10:58,380
someone who understands application

291
00:10:58,380 --> 00:11:01,620
security because when you do devops

292
00:11:01,620 --> 00:11:03,420
whatever component you take for your

293
00:11:03,420 --> 00:11:05,399
application security checkpoint

294
00:11:05,399 --> 00:11:07,260
unless you're starting with the security

295
00:11:07,260 --> 00:11:09,600
Champions first you probably need a

296
00:11:09,600 --> 00:11:11,640
technical person in the team who has

297
00:11:11,640 --> 00:11:13,200
been a developer in the past who

298
00:11:13,200 --> 00:11:15,839
understands the developer workflow and

299
00:11:15,839 --> 00:11:17,160
can work with the developers to

300
00:11:17,160 --> 00:11:20,640
understand how can you work a desktop

301
00:11:20,640 --> 00:11:23,579
solution that would fit in really nicely

302
00:11:23,579 --> 00:11:25,079
into what they're doing like for example

303
00:11:25,079 --> 00:11:28,440
you may use uh I don't know sneak as a

304
00:11:28,440 --> 00:11:30,660
product for your SCA which is software

305
00:11:30,660 --> 00:11:32,220
composition analysis or maybe even for

306
00:11:32,220 --> 00:11:35,100
static code analysis and you may buy the

307
00:11:35,100 --> 00:11:36,600
component for GitHub you might just say

308
00:11:36,600 --> 00:11:37,980
oh I just need GitHub I don't need

309
00:11:37,980 --> 00:11:39,839
anything else now I'm not sure if that's

310
00:11:39,839 --> 00:11:42,180
how sneak works but if that's how it was

311
00:11:42,180 --> 00:11:44,700
working and you assume that oh I need

312
00:11:44,700 --> 00:11:46,740
GitHub and I'll get sneak for my appsic

313
00:11:46,740 --> 00:11:48,720
component and that would be it what do

314
00:11:48,720 --> 00:11:50,880
you realize once you start working is

315
00:11:50,880 --> 00:11:52,860
that oh actually my team does not even

316
00:11:52,860 --> 00:11:54,779
use GitHub they use gitlab or they use

317
00:11:54,779 --> 00:11:57,060
uh actually yeah this is a great example

318
00:11:57,060 --> 00:11:59,220
what if they use fabricator for people

319
00:11:59,220 --> 00:12:00,440
who haven't heard of fabricator

320
00:12:00,440 --> 00:12:04,140
fabricator was a self-hosted I guess

321
00:12:04,140 --> 00:12:07,140
predecessor of GitHub have gitlab from

322
00:12:07,140 --> 00:12:09,360
all the modern as it used to be people

323
00:12:09,360 --> 00:12:11,279
are using fabricator still in a lot of

324
00:12:11,279 --> 00:12:13,860
organizations I think as I was at AWS re

325
00:12:13,860 --> 00:12:16,260
invent uh last week and I met someone

326
00:12:16,260 --> 00:12:18,060
who's still using fabricator as well so

327
00:12:18,060 --> 00:12:20,100
it is still very much a thing and it is

328
00:12:20,100 --> 00:12:22,260
self-hosted so there is no I'm gonna go

329
00:12:22,260 --> 00:12:24,300
on a URL on the internet I'm gonna find

330
00:12:24,300 --> 00:12:26,100
it and be able to you know work with it

331
00:12:26,100 --> 00:12:28,500
so to some of the tools that you might

332
00:12:28,500 --> 00:12:30,540
find for your uh for your application

333
00:12:30,540 --> 00:12:33,120
security pieces may not even work so

334
00:12:33,120 --> 00:12:35,160
like you know things like that and you

335
00:12:35,160 --> 00:12:37,019
make those mistakes and you realize oh

336
00:12:37,019 --> 00:12:37,980
wait

337
00:12:37,980 --> 00:12:40,800
I got the right component or maybe I did

338
00:12:40,800 --> 00:12:42,360
the right well I asked the right

339
00:12:42,360 --> 00:12:43,920
questions but I didn't understand how

340
00:12:43,920 --> 00:12:45,959
would a developer use it so there's no

341
00:12:45,959 --> 00:12:47,820
integration now

342
00:12:47,820 --> 00:12:49,980
I obviously learned from that and the

343
00:12:49,980 --> 00:12:52,320
next time around I gave uh devsecups a

344
00:12:52,320 --> 00:12:54,000
short I made sure I had an application

345
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:56,399
security person in the team may not be

346
00:12:56,399 --> 00:12:58,200
the most experienced person that have

347
00:12:58,200 --> 00:13:00,480
been there but I think the intent was to

348
00:13:00,480 --> 00:13:02,639
have someone in there who can learn as

349
00:13:02,639 --> 00:13:04,800
they go in the job as well and the

350
00:13:04,800 --> 00:13:05,880
developers are generally friendly

351
00:13:05,880 --> 00:13:07,380
friendly people as well similar to

352
00:13:07,380 --> 00:13:09,360
security so they should be able to help

353
00:13:09,360 --> 00:13:11,940
learn I guess like you know teach each

354
00:13:11,940 --> 00:13:13,860
other one person can be security to the

355
00:13:13,860 --> 00:13:14,880
other person and the other person can

356
00:13:14,880 --> 00:13:17,160
talk about the development workflow but

357
00:13:17,160 --> 00:13:18,720
you kind of need to have that kind of a

358
00:13:18,720 --> 00:13:21,120
open mind to be able to go into a

359
00:13:21,120 --> 00:13:22,560
conversation with the understanding that

360
00:13:22,560 --> 00:13:25,139
hey I'm here to learn and I just want to

361
00:13:25,139 --> 00:13:27,120
make sure that I I may I'm able to make

362
00:13:27,120 --> 00:13:30,420
the most of this as well now

363
00:13:30,420 --> 00:13:33,540
the next component probably uh very

364
00:13:33,540 --> 00:13:36,240
commonly asked question by people is hey

365
00:13:36,240 --> 00:13:37,260
what are some of the other reasons

366
00:13:37,260 --> 00:13:39,779
people I've shared my own experience

367
00:13:39,779 --> 00:13:41,579
talking to some of the other people what

368
00:13:41,579 --> 00:13:45,000
I realized was uh sometimes it's just as

369
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:47,399
simple as the organization does not want

370
00:13:47,399 --> 00:13:48,660
to do it so there would not be any

371
00:13:48,660 --> 00:13:50,100
funding available

372
00:13:50,100 --> 00:13:51,480
if you're trying to run a security

373
00:13:51,480 --> 00:13:53,040
Champions program

374
00:13:53,040 --> 00:13:54,839
to have a successful Champions program

375
00:13:54,839 --> 00:13:58,380
you need to be able to a get the right

376
00:13:58,380 --> 00:13:59,940
stakeholders from the development side

377
00:13:59,940 --> 00:14:01,440
like the going back to the examples that

378
00:14:01,440 --> 00:14:04,019
I said earlier the manager of kavika and

379
00:14:04,019 --> 00:14:06,180
Shelby who are the two developers I need

380
00:14:06,180 --> 00:14:07,860
to be able to convince the manager that

381
00:14:07,860 --> 00:14:10,440
hey I need uh two of your awesome people

382
00:14:10,440 --> 00:14:13,139
to come and work on the devsec website

383
00:14:13,139 --> 00:14:15,060
I'm going to provide some training

384
00:14:15,060 --> 00:14:16,620
and we're gonna have this amazing time

385
00:14:16,620 --> 00:14:18,360
because we will be able to do death

386
00:14:18,360 --> 00:14:20,519
setups and we'll be able to go free go

387
00:14:20,519 --> 00:14:22,980
more frequently into production in a

388
00:14:22,980 --> 00:14:25,920
secure way sometimes it's just that you

389
00:14:25,920 --> 00:14:27,300
don't really have an organization that

390
00:14:27,300 --> 00:14:29,579
is ready for doing their setups so no

391
00:14:29,579 --> 00:14:31,620
matter how hard you try to see so it

392
00:14:31,620 --> 00:14:33,180
doesn't work sometimes it's

393
00:14:33,180 --> 00:14:36,600
organizational culture not having a open

394
00:14:36,600 --> 00:14:38,940
mind around the fact that you would have

395
00:14:38,940 --> 00:14:41,160
to do a lot of collaboration

396
00:14:41,160 --> 00:14:43,380
and having an organization where the

397
00:14:43,380 --> 00:14:46,440
development team feels it's okay for

398
00:14:46,440 --> 00:14:48,720
them to reach out to security

399
00:14:48,720 --> 00:14:51,899
for a mistake or for a fact that I'm not

400
00:14:51,899 --> 00:14:53,279
sure what do I do for this whole

401
00:14:53,279 --> 00:14:54,779
security perspective can you help me

402
00:14:54,779 --> 00:14:56,519
like not having some of those

403
00:14:56,519 --> 00:14:59,639
organizational cultural uh elements in

404
00:14:59,639 --> 00:15:02,519
the organization is an absolute uh for I

405
00:15:02,519 --> 00:15:04,139
mean I guess absolute show way of

406
00:15:04,139 --> 00:15:06,899
failing death setups as well now

407
00:15:06,899 --> 00:15:08,940
I spoke about the benefits of other

408
00:15:08,940 --> 00:15:12,540
things as well but another CSO uh I

409
00:15:12,540 --> 00:15:16,260
guess challenge that I see sometimes now

410
00:15:16,260 --> 00:15:18,660
there are technical features there are

411
00:15:18,660 --> 00:15:20,220
leadership to UC source and there are

412
00:15:20,220 --> 00:15:22,260
non-technical thesis as well I

413
00:15:22,260 --> 00:15:24,180
personally classify myself as a CSO

414
00:15:24,180 --> 00:15:26,399
who's technical uh with some leadership

415
00:15:26,399 --> 00:15:28,380
capabilities but some of them are pure

416
00:15:28,380 --> 00:15:29,820
leaders and make sense for the large

417
00:15:29,820 --> 00:15:32,100
organizations that they work for now

418
00:15:32,100 --> 00:15:34,260
some leaders some csos may not be

419
00:15:34,260 --> 00:15:36,540
technical the challenge over there

420
00:15:36,540 --> 00:15:39,180
becomes that they would say listen to a

421
00:15:39,180 --> 00:15:41,399
conversation about their second-offs uh

422
00:15:41,399 --> 00:15:42,660
without understanding the technical

423
00:15:42,660 --> 00:15:45,240
details of it and not just because they

424
00:15:45,240 --> 00:15:46,320
don't want to learn but they don't

425
00:15:46,320 --> 00:15:47,880
normally don't have enough time to kind

426
00:15:47,880 --> 00:15:49,560
of work on that as well so you might

427
00:15:49,560 --> 00:15:50,639
find that there is no clear

428
00:15:50,639 --> 00:15:53,940
understanding of what the objective for

429
00:15:53,940 --> 00:15:55,800
devsecops should be by objective what I

430
00:15:55,800 --> 00:15:59,339
mean is hey we should at least have one

431
00:15:59,339 --> 00:16:00,779
application

432
00:16:00,779 --> 00:16:03,420
working with using deaf psychos

433
00:16:03,420 --> 00:16:05,459
principles by the end of the quarter by

434
00:16:05,459 --> 00:16:07,320
the end of the year that is a great

435
00:16:07,320 --> 00:16:09,480
objective if you are working in a really

436
00:16:09,480 --> 00:16:11,579
complex environment now what that would

437
00:16:11,579 --> 00:16:13,199
look like the details of it that's all

438
00:16:13,199 --> 00:16:15,180
tactical but having just one objective a

439
00:16:15,180 --> 00:16:16,920
lot of people just go I'm going to do

440
00:16:16,920 --> 00:16:18,720
desk setups I'm going to hire a desktops

441
00:16:18,720 --> 00:16:20,820
engineer because clearly people apply

442
00:16:20,820 --> 00:16:24,300
for the job as well and uh it seems to

443
00:16:24,300 --> 00:16:26,399
be a thing now the place where it gets

444
00:16:26,399 --> 00:16:28,139
confusing is like when a devsecops

445
00:16:28,139 --> 00:16:31,260
engineer is being asked to uh not do

446
00:16:31,260 --> 00:16:34,440
devsecopsing but more ask to do like uh

447
00:16:34,440 --> 00:16:35,940
different infrastructure things which is

448
00:16:35,940 --> 00:16:37,860
kind of weird but I'll let that be a

449
00:16:37,860 --> 00:16:40,800
conversation for another time now the

450
00:16:40,800 --> 00:16:42,839
other part where as a CSO some people

451
00:16:42,839 --> 00:16:44,459
fail is

452
00:16:44,459 --> 00:16:46,980
sometimes in an organization you have to

453
00:16:46,980 --> 00:16:50,279
convey the importance of working on any

454
00:16:50,279 --> 00:16:53,160
particular security risk based on the

455
00:16:53,160 --> 00:16:55,019
metrics of the organization by matrix

456
00:16:55,019 --> 00:16:56,519
what I mean is every organization would

457
00:16:56,519 --> 00:16:58,620
have a risk Matrix they would say that

458
00:16:58,620 --> 00:17:01,380
oh if I were to be hacked by a hacker

459
00:17:01,380 --> 00:17:05,400
that is a very high risk but if I was to

460
00:17:05,400 --> 00:17:08,339
have a storage volume somewhere in my

461
00:17:08,339 --> 00:17:10,380
AWS account which is my Amazon web

462
00:17:10,380 --> 00:17:12,959
service cloud account and for whatever

463
00:17:12,959 --> 00:17:14,939
reason that was unencrypted but it's in

464
00:17:14,939 --> 00:17:18,059
a really private location that's a very

465
00:17:18,059 --> 00:17:20,880
low risk and people may have low high so

466
00:17:20,880 --> 00:17:23,040
low medium high very high

467
00:17:23,040 --> 00:17:24,780
it may change when the name may change

468
00:17:24,780 --> 00:17:25,980
for different organization but that's

469
00:17:25,980 --> 00:17:28,559
kind of how people measure whether they

470
00:17:28,559 --> 00:17:30,419
should give importance to it or not now

471
00:17:30,419 --> 00:17:32,160
from a devsecos perspective if your

472
00:17:32,160 --> 00:17:34,440
communication is not well uh I guess

473
00:17:34,440 --> 00:17:36,299
well executed you might find there might

474
00:17:36,299 --> 00:17:37,620
be organizations where you know you're

475
00:17:37,620 --> 00:17:38,820
having conversations where it doesn't

476
00:17:38,820 --> 00:17:40,980
just doesn't translate well people don't

477
00:17:40,980 --> 00:17:43,220
understand the risk behind introducing

478
00:17:43,220 --> 00:17:46,580
uh security bugs in the in production

479
00:17:46,580 --> 00:17:48,780
instead of fixing them in the beginning

480
00:17:48,780 --> 00:17:50,520
which is the whole shift left movement

481
00:17:50,520 --> 00:17:52,260
people hear about and talk about

482
00:17:52,260 --> 00:17:54,419
now that's kind of where most of the

483
00:17:54,419 --> 00:17:56,400
conversation would just land on and

484
00:17:56,400 --> 00:17:58,080
unclear communication is probably the

485
00:17:58,080 --> 00:18:00,900
most most uh important thing people will

486
00:18:00,900 --> 00:18:02,280
think about as they kind of go through

487
00:18:02,280 --> 00:18:05,160
the component of it now moving on to the

488
00:18:05,160 --> 00:18:07,140
uh next part as well where you know

489
00:18:07,140 --> 00:18:09,960
still slide

490
00:18:09,960 --> 00:18:12,419
oh yeah sorry one more component I want

491
00:18:12,419 --> 00:18:14,220
to talk about is the success Matrix as

492
00:18:14,220 --> 00:18:16,380
well as uh calling out the fact that

493
00:18:16,380 --> 00:18:19,500
even though you're working towards a uh

494
00:18:19,500 --> 00:18:22,620
I guess a security

495
00:18:22,620 --> 00:18:26,100
compliance kind of framework uh desktops

496
00:18:26,100 --> 00:18:28,580
is not a compliance governance framework

497
00:18:28,580 --> 00:18:31,860
devsecops is separate you may have

498
00:18:31,860 --> 00:18:36,120
applications that are required to be uh

499
00:18:36,120 --> 00:18:37,620
to be compliant but that doesn't mean

500
00:18:37,620 --> 00:18:39,600
they are also the uh you know they are

501
00:18:39,600 --> 00:18:40,740
they are the components that you need to

502
00:18:40,740 --> 00:18:42,960
be required straight as my my camera's

503
00:18:42,960 --> 00:18:45,120
not working right try and work that up

504
00:18:45,120 --> 00:18:47,160
doesn't gonna come up so I'm just gonna

505
00:18:47,160 --> 00:18:49,160
keep working through this

506
00:18:49,160 --> 00:18:51,720
as long as you folks can hear me

507
00:18:51,720 --> 00:18:54,240
all right so the next thing that I want

508
00:18:54,240 --> 00:18:56,100
to call out is oh yeah just finishing up

509
00:18:56,100 --> 00:18:58,980
that Dev Cyclops is not a governance

510
00:18:58,980 --> 00:19:01,440
compliance framework if you are required

511
00:19:01,440 --> 00:19:02,880
to do a governance compliance framework

512
00:19:02,880 --> 00:19:04,380
you probably should look at uh

513
00:19:04,380 --> 00:19:06,059
whatever's required from the industry

514
00:19:06,059 --> 00:19:09,240
standard devsecops is just to enable you

515
00:19:09,240 --> 00:19:12,480
to integrate security into your already

516
00:19:12,480 --> 00:19:15,179
existing devops uh I guess people

517
00:19:15,179 --> 00:19:17,280
processing technology

518
00:19:17,280 --> 00:19:19,679
well let's talk about why teams fail

519
00:19:19,679 --> 00:19:21,419
that we spoke about the leadership level

520
00:19:21,419 --> 00:19:23,160
having done that in the past I was able

521
00:19:23,160 --> 00:19:24,480
to share that

522
00:19:24,480 --> 00:19:25,860
um I can probably bring some of the

523
00:19:25,860 --> 00:19:27,960
failures we had uh based on the first

524
00:19:27,960 --> 00:19:29,880
failed deaths that cost price that I had

525
00:19:29,880 --> 00:19:31,620
there's a lack of leadership support

526
00:19:31,620 --> 00:19:33,360
which I mentioned where if I were to go

527
00:19:33,360 --> 00:19:35,280
back to the managers of the developers

528
00:19:35,280 --> 00:19:37,500
that I have to work with if I can't get

529
00:19:37,500 --> 00:19:39,900
their support for allowing their

530
00:19:39,900 --> 00:19:41,640
developers to spend time on this then

531
00:19:41,640 --> 00:19:43,320
it's a it's a fail to begin with like

532
00:19:43,320 --> 00:19:46,500
there's no amount of work you can do to

533
00:19:46,500 --> 00:19:48,740
enable their setups

534
00:19:48,740 --> 00:19:51,419
and poorly defined the policies

535
00:19:51,419 --> 00:19:54,059
procedures and procedures means that if

536
00:19:54,059 --> 00:19:58,020
you are allowing people to have say uh

537
00:19:58,020 --> 00:20:00,120
I'll just say have allow them to have

538
00:20:00,120 --> 00:20:02,220
leverage to the fact that oh yeah you

539
00:20:02,220 --> 00:20:04,140
can do Dev Cycles but we only do one

540
00:20:04,140 --> 00:20:05,780
component so don't worry about the rest

541
00:20:05,780 --> 00:20:08,820
or we have a strict policy that we

542
00:20:08,820 --> 00:20:10,500
should have everything encrypted now

543
00:20:10,500 --> 00:20:12,780
that's a great test to be included in

544
00:20:12,780 --> 00:20:16,260
devsecops but the component being uh

545
00:20:16,260 --> 00:20:18,660
well the component being

546
00:20:18,660 --> 00:20:21,059
it should not be it should be automated

547
00:20:21,059 --> 00:20:23,760
it's a great process to have but some

548
00:20:23,760 --> 00:20:25,140
people may or may not choose to put that

549
00:20:25,140 --> 00:20:26,940
in so they might make a really complex

550
00:20:26,940 --> 00:20:29,160
policy or try to automate that instead

551
00:20:29,160 --> 00:20:30,720
of trying to work through some of the

552
00:20:30,720 --> 00:20:33,120
low-hanging fruits in the beginning

553
00:20:33,120 --> 00:20:35,880
the other part is as a CSO you may be

554
00:20:35,880 --> 00:20:38,520
communing with the leaders but as as

555
00:20:38,520 --> 00:20:40,500
someone who's in the team your

556
00:20:40,500 --> 00:20:42,900
responsibility would be to work with the

557
00:20:42,900 --> 00:20:45,360
developers themselves directly if you

558
00:20:45,360 --> 00:20:48,240
don't communicate and clearly State out

559
00:20:48,240 --> 00:20:50,160
the goal of what you would like to

560
00:20:50,160 --> 00:20:52,500
achieve from a devsecos perspective not

561
00:20:52,500 --> 00:20:54,000
giving a clear picture leaves them

562
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:56,220
confused and they pre after the first

563
00:20:56,220 --> 00:20:57,840
meeting you will find they might not

564
00:20:57,840 --> 00:20:59,700
come to any more of your security

565
00:20:59,700 --> 00:21:01,799
Champions program uh catch up for lunch

566
00:21:01,799 --> 00:21:04,679
and learns uh talking about lunch lens

567
00:21:04,679 --> 00:21:06,419
as well having a effective security

568
00:21:06,419 --> 00:21:09,360
Champions program requires you to be uh

569
00:21:09,360 --> 00:21:12,299
at least well aware in how you are going

570
00:21:12,299 --> 00:21:15,120
to solve the integration of security as

571
00:21:15,120 --> 00:21:17,940
well as uh the development team in your

572
00:21:17,940 --> 00:21:20,039
organization which requires you to

573
00:21:20,039 --> 00:21:21,480
understand that there was uh the

574
00:21:21,480 --> 00:21:24,600
developer workflow now as you go through

575
00:21:24,600 --> 00:21:26,820
this I would also encourage you to kind

576
00:21:26,820 --> 00:21:30,240
of kind of think about hey uh now that

577
00:21:30,240 --> 00:21:31,679
you thought about this in a in a

578
00:21:31,679 --> 00:21:35,280
different way what can you do to uh I

579
00:21:35,280 --> 00:21:37,559
guess make make this better last but not

580
00:21:37,559 --> 00:21:39,539
least is the fact that once you have

581
00:21:39,539 --> 00:21:42,240
deployed all of this uh even though you

582
00:21:42,240 --> 00:21:45,299
have say the right communication you've

583
00:21:45,299 --> 00:21:47,220
done the dev Cycles right way

584
00:21:47,220 --> 00:21:49,080
you're not trying to have any kind of

585
00:21:49,080 --> 00:21:50,700
feedback loop by feedback loop what I

586
00:21:50,700 --> 00:21:51,659
mean is

587
00:21:51,659 --> 00:21:54,240
you've made up a program you've told us

588
00:21:54,240 --> 00:21:56,039
hey you're Ashish you're amazing you're

589
00:21:56,039 --> 00:21:58,500
you're a security Champions program uh

590
00:21:58,500 --> 00:22:00,000
member and we're really proud of you

591
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:02,880
blah blah you do a great job now if you

592
00:22:02,880 --> 00:22:05,340
just drop the ball there and you know

593
00:22:05,340 --> 00:22:07,799
don't do any work with Ashish after that

594
00:22:07,799 --> 00:22:09,179
and just hope that she should come back

595
00:22:09,179 --> 00:22:11,520
to you that's not how relationships work

596
00:22:11,520 --> 00:22:13,620
security Champion program is also almost

597
00:22:13,620 --> 00:22:16,200
like building a community of security

598
00:22:16,200 --> 00:22:18,059
friendlies in an organization so you

599
00:22:18,059 --> 00:22:19,620
have to work with them on a consistent

600
00:22:19,620 --> 00:22:21,900
basis now whether sometimes it's

601
00:22:21,900 --> 00:22:23,820
literally just having

602
00:22:23,820 --> 00:22:26,760
a non-work conversation over a zoom or a

603
00:22:26,760 --> 00:22:28,740
Google talk or whatever online medium

604
00:22:28,740 --> 00:22:30,480
you use to communicate with person or

605
00:22:30,480 --> 00:22:32,460
in-person conversation but it's all

606
00:22:32,460 --> 00:22:36,000
about consistently building uh the repo

607
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:37,440
and relationship with all the security

608
00:22:37,440 --> 00:22:39,000
Champions that you are going to work

609
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:41,280
with on an ongoing basis to know when

610
00:22:41,280 --> 00:22:43,080
and how they need some help

611
00:22:43,080 --> 00:22:46,140
sometimes is uh it's as simple as that

612
00:22:46,140 --> 00:22:47,760
you're just not communicating enough so

613
00:22:47,760 --> 00:22:48,840
they don't want to they don't feel

614
00:22:48,840 --> 00:22:51,539
excited about it and I think I want to

615
00:22:51,539 --> 00:22:52,860
you would be able to come back to the

616
00:22:52,860 --> 00:22:54,600
rest of the uh bullet points as well but

617
00:22:54,600 --> 00:22:55,919
in the interest of time I'll let you

618
00:22:55,919 --> 00:22:58,500
kind of catch up on that uh but I wanted

619
00:22:58,500 --> 00:23:01,799
to talk about this so as I spoke about

620
00:23:01,799 --> 00:23:04,340
the fact that hey

621
00:23:04,340 --> 00:23:08,039
we know why we are failing and I for

622
00:23:08,039 --> 00:23:09,480
people who've been using the chat Ops

623
00:23:09,480 --> 00:23:11,640
thing uh which is an open AI component

624
00:23:11,640 --> 00:23:13,020
which is basically using artificial

625
00:23:13,020 --> 00:23:14,760
intelligence I did this thing yesterday

626
00:23:14,760 --> 00:23:18,600
where I asked the uh the open AI

627
00:23:18,600 --> 00:23:20,400
artificial intelligence

628
00:23:20,400 --> 00:23:22,740
what are some of the things required for

629
00:23:22,740 --> 00:23:25,080
uh devsecops and I think it's a it's a

630
00:23:25,080 --> 00:23:26,520
really short video but you'll find that

631
00:23:26,520 --> 00:23:28,020
artificial intelligence has figured out

632
00:23:28,020 --> 00:23:32,418
a way to do this and if I can play

633
00:23:32,460 --> 00:23:36,559
oops sorry there you go that should work

634
00:23:36,559 --> 00:23:39,799
and play

635
00:23:40,740 --> 00:23:44,220
wow okay I'm gonna move come back come

636
00:23:44,220 --> 00:23:46,820
back come back

637
00:23:47,640 --> 00:23:48,780
this is what happens when you're trying

638
00:23:48,780 --> 00:23:51,840
to do a demo in a live

639
00:23:51,840 --> 00:23:53,760
that should work

640
00:23:53,760 --> 00:23:56,600
I'll be patient

641
00:23:56,760 --> 00:23:59,520
yep it's working hopefully it loads up

642
00:23:59,520 --> 00:24:02,299
for you folks as well

643
00:24:08,100 --> 00:24:10,740
uh uh

644
00:24:10,740 --> 00:24:12,780
okay I think it's gonna take some time

645
00:24:12,780 --> 00:24:15,059
but essentially uh the idea was over

646
00:24:15,059 --> 00:24:16,799
there most of the lists that I called

647
00:24:16,799 --> 00:24:18,780
out from a CSO perspective as well as

648
00:24:18,780 --> 00:24:21,600
for a it's literally supposed to be a

649
00:24:21,600 --> 00:24:23,280
video I'm surprised I'll share the link

650
00:24:23,280 --> 00:24:25,260
with the video later on but the idea

651
00:24:25,260 --> 00:24:27,539
behind this is that hey we should be

652
00:24:27,539 --> 00:24:29,940
able to use uh most of the conversation

653
00:24:29,940 --> 00:24:31,919
that we are I'm gonna copy the link and

654
00:24:31,919 --> 00:24:34,020
maybe someone can paste it into the

655
00:24:34,020 --> 00:24:36,240
comment section

656
00:24:36,240 --> 00:24:38,820
uh so that you can just go back to and

657
00:24:38,820 --> 00:24:40,380
have a look at it basically it's a video

658
00:24:40,380 --> 00:24:43,260
of how

659
00:24:43,260 --> 00:24:45,379
um

660
00:24:45,860 --> 00:24:48,000
but essentially I asked a question with

661
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:50,100
the AI why or what do I need to be

662
00:24:50,100 --> 00:24:52,500
having devsecops implemented in an

663
00:24:52,500 --> 00:24:54,059
organization it gave me a list of 20

664
00:24:54,059 --> 00:24:56,100
things which is quite surprising and a

665
00:24:56,100 --> 00:24:57,720
lot of them actually matched to the my

666
00:24:57,720 --> 00:25:00,480
two previous slides that I have so I I

667
00:25:00,480 --> 00:25:03,120
was like wow it can do a great job but

668
00:25:03,120 --> 00:25:06,360
the trucks of this is

669
00:25:06,360 --> 00:25:08,700
it I'm gonna go back to what I said in

670
00:25:08,700 --> 00:25:11,220
the beginning it is similar to working

671
00:25:11,220 --> 00:25:13,260
out and you know feeling healthy and

672
00:25:13,260 --> 00:25:15,720
just being better in life about your own

673
00:25:15,720 --> 00:25:17,880
health the same way as Jeff setups as

674
00:25:17,880 --> 00:25:20,400
well where all of us know kind of like

675
00:25:20,400 --> 00:25:22,440
going to the gym how can we get good abs

676
00:25:22,440 --> 00:25:25,559
and how can we look really fit if we eat

677
00:25:25,559 --> 00:25:28,980
right sleep enough and I guess maybe

678
00:25:28,980 --> 00:25:30,900
drink enough water as well everyone

679
00:25:30,900 --> 00:25:32,340
knows what the basic foundational

680
00:25:32,340 --> 00:25:35,279
requirement for having a fit body is but

681
00:25:35,279 --> 00:25:37,200
how many of us are actually having a fit

682
00:25:37,200 --> 00:25:40,500
body and uh not like me I guess so but I

683
00:25:40,500 --> 00:25:42,320
think I definitely find that

684
00:25:42,320 --> 00:25:45,779
devsecops is very similar but instead of

685
00:25:45,779 --> 00:25:48,120
calling it a failure on an individual I

686
00:25:48,120 --> 00:25:49,620
think it's a failure from a cultural

687
00:25:49,620 --> 00:25:52,320
perspective by by that what I mean is if

688
00:25:52,320 --> 00:25:54,360
there is no leadership support for what

689
00:25:54,360 --> 00:25:57,600
should be the case or in terms of I

690
00:25:57,600 --> 00:26:00,240
don't have a buy-in from my development

691
00:26:00,240 --> 00:26:02,039
stakeholders if I don't have a bind from

692
00:26:02,039 --> 00:26:05,159
my senior leadership my CEO my CTO if

693
00:26:05,159 --> 00:26:07,980
there is no empathy of understanding

694
00:26:07,980 --> 00:26:10,919
what the challenges of a developer are

695
00:26:10,919 --> 00:26:13,140
to basically Implement a small change

696
00:26:13,140 --> 00:26:15,000
and asking them to do security things

697
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:16,980
without understanding that hey they

698
00:26:16,980 --> 00:26:18,419
actually have a whole full nine to five

699
00:26:18,419 --> 00:26:20,820
even though my role may say I'm a deaf

700
00:26:20,820 --> 00:26:22,559
Tech Ops engineer doesn't really mean

701
00:26:22,559 --> 00:26:24,059
the development of development person

702
00:26:24,059 --> 00:26:26,039
out there is sitting just not doing

703
00:26:26,039 --> 00:26:27,419
anything waiting for us to come back to

704
00:26:27,419 --> 00:26:29,940
them the other one the last two probably

705
00:26:29,940 --> 00:26:32,220
the more important ones where assuming

706
00:26:32,220 --> 00:26:34,620
that you can have devsecops without an

707
00:26:34,620 --> 00:26:37,620
open-minded security traditionally

708
00:26:37,620 --> 00:26:39,240
security teams have been called the no

709
00:26:39,240 --> 00:26:42,059
team just because a lot of times in a

710
00:26:42,059 --> 00:26:43,740
lot of occasions people were finding

711
00:26:43,740 --> 00:26:45,900
that uh you know their security

712
00:26:45,900 --> 00:26:47,940
organization is not even open to the

713
00:26:47,940 --> 00:26:51,360
idea of working with the uh with the

714
00:26:51,360 --> 00:26:53,340
with the development team because it's

715
00:26:53,340 --> 00:26:55,260
okay to not know all the answers and

716
00:26:55,260 --> 00:26:58,020
it's okay to be I guess learning new

717
00:26:58,020 --> 00:26:59,880
things with your colleagues in the

718
00:26:59,880 --> 00:27:01,860
organization it's okay to be humble

719
00:27:01,860 --> 00:27:04,020
about it last one without without

720
00:27:04,020 --> 00:27:06,360
inauguration cultural change that is not

721
00:27:06,360 --> 00:27:09,179
going to happen so yeah that's pretty

722
00:27:09,179 --> 00:27:10,620
much what I wanted to talk about but

723
00:27:10,620 --> 00:27:12,059
what I want to leave you is with a

724
00:27:12,059 --> 00:27:13,200
question

725
00:27:13,200 --> 00:27:15,240
what are you going to change what are

726
00:27:15,240 --> 00:27:17,279
you going to change about your culture

727
00:27:17,279 --> 00:27:19,320
today

728
00:27:19,320 --> 00:27:21,900
that's my uh question for you as you

729
00:27:21,900 --> 00:27:24,299
kind of go back uh from this the one

730
00:27:24,299 --> 00:27:26,159
question that I care about and I hope

731
00:27:26,159 --> 00:27:27,960
you care about as well if you have a

732
00:27:27,960 --> 00:27:30,600
great culture you should be able to go

733
00:27:30,600 --> 00:27:33,299
in and you know Implement their circles

734
00:27:33,299 --> 00:27:35,100
the right way but otherwise that's a

735
00:27:35,100 --> 00:27:36,240
link to the cloud security podcast as

736
00:27:36,240 --> 00:27:37,740
well we talk about devsecops and Cloud

737
00:27:37,740 --> 00:27:39,240
security as well if you have any

738
00:27:39,240 --> 00:27:41,340
questions or any comments feel free to

739
00:27:41,340 --> 00:27:43,500
drop them in uh if there are any

740
00:27:43,500 --> 00:27:45,720
questions I'm happy to take them as well

741
00:27:45,720 --> 00:27:47,400
but otherwise have to to come back to

742
00:27:47,400 --> 00:27:49,880
you folks

743
00:27:50,880 --> 00:27:53,039
unmute thank you so much for that Ashish

744
00:27:53,039 --> 00:27:55,200
that was really really a good way to

745
00:27:55,200 --> 00:27:57,779
kick off devsecops and it fitted in

746
00:27:57,779 --> 00:27:59,400
quite well with what kavika and I was

747
00:27:59,400 --> 00:28:00,419
actually talking about at the beginning

748
00:28:00,419 --> 00:28:03,539
that you know how devsecops is even

749
00:28:03,539 --> 00:28:05,279
though it's been around for a while um

750
00:28:05,279 --> 00:28:07,020
different places are implementing it

751
00:28:07,020 --> 00:28:09,179
differently and uh it's good to see you

752
00:28:09,179 --> 00:28:11,940
back on the screen as well I was like we

753
00:28:11,940 --> 00:28:14,159
took the entire entire screen it's like

754
00:28:14,159 --> 00:28:15,840
entire presentation is over now the

755
00:28:15,840 --> 00:28:17,640
camera comes on

756
00:28:17,640 --> 00:28:19,620
yes this is just the way it works you

757
00:28:19,620 --> 00:28:21,179
know you just want to be able to focus

758
00:28:21,179 --> 00:28:22,860
on the presentation and not on your

759
00:28:22,860 --> 00:28:27,178
gorgeous beard I guess so yeah

760
00:28:29,940 --> 00:28:32,419
yes

761
00:28:32,580 --> 00:28:35,159
some pets and kids on the stream are a

762
00:28:35,159 --> 00:28:37,620
must I think it was really interesting

763
00:28:37,620 --> 00:28:38,640
for me

764
00:28:38,640 --> 00:28:40,279
um you know the the whole thing about

765
00:28:40,279 --> 00:28:42,480
devsecops being a culture thing and not

766
00:28:42,480 --> 00:28:45,299
an individual thing that is so so true

767
00:28:45,299 --> 00:28:46,440
um I think that's something that you

768
00:28:46,440 --> 00:28:48,900
know we can definitely walk away with

769
00:28:48,900 --> 00:28:51,120
um we did actually have a question for

770
00:28:51,120 --> 00:28:53,760
you so it's coming from Kavita who was

771
00:28:53,760 --> 00:28:56,760
joining us on Hopkins and she's asked uh

772
00:28:56,760 --> 00:28:59,640
whose responsibility is

773
00:28:59,640 --> 00:29:02,520
um devsecops in a large organization so

774
00:29:02,520 --> 00:29:04,860
is it the CIO or the csos I think that's

775
00:29:04,860 --> 00:29:06,960
a great question thanks Kavita and would

776
00:29:06,960 --> 00:29:08,659
love to get your thoughts on that Ashish

777
00:29:08,659 --> 00:29:11,400
yep I think I think I'll probably go

778
00:29:11,400 --> 00:29:14,039
back to the organization as a whole is

779
00:29:14,039 --> 00:29:16,559
responsible for security the example

780
00:29:16,559 --> 00:29:18,659
that I'll give is and most people are

781
00:29:18,659 --> 00:29:20,700
talking about this already where the

782
00:29:20,700 --> 00:29:22,980
Uber example where Uber ciso was

783
00:29:22,980 --> 00:29:25,559
prosecuted and potentially is going to

784
00:29:25,559 --> 00:29:27,840
be jailed as well what that has meant is

785
00:29:27,840 --> 00:29:29,640
a lot of csos are actually calling out

786
00:29:29,640 --> 00:29:31,320
like earlier we would just say it on

787
00:29:31,320 --> 00:29:33,179
like an online forum and say yeah yeah

788
00:29:33,179 --> 00:29:35,100
it's a it's a responsible for the entire

789
00:29:35,100 --> 00:29:37,440
organization now it's not just the

790
00:29:37,440 --> 00:29:39,659
organization but also the board that is

791
00:29:39,659 --> 00:29:42,360
responsible for uh say funding the

792
00:29:42,360 --> 00:29:44,159
company that they're the response ones

793
00:29:44,159 --> 00:29:45,659
responsible for looking at how when

794
00:29:45,659 --> 00:29:46,980
what's the next round of funding going

795
00:29:46,980 --> 00:29:49,260
to be so the board is responsible the

796
00:29:49,260 --> 00:29:51,059
organization is also responsible so I'll

797
00:29:51,059 --> 00:29:52,380
probably say

798
00:29:52,380 --> 00:29:54,419
we have responsibility as security

799
00:29:54,419 --> 00:29:56,159
people to convey that there is a better

800
00:29:56,159 --> 00:29:58,440
way to do security in the organization

801
00:29:58,440 --> 00:30:01,500
but that we are a guidance tool we are

802
00:30:01,500 --> 00:30:04,679
not the implementer because our job is

803
00:30:04,679 --> 00:30:07,500
to support the CIO or the CTO to you

804
00:30:07,500 --> 00:30:09,360
know to do better make Foster products

805
00:30:09,360 --> 00:30:11,760
and always be ahead of competition it's

806
00:30:11,760 --> 00:30:13,679
a responsibility of the board the CEO

807
00:30:13,679 --> 00:30:15,899
and the CTO to know

808
00:30:15,899 --> 00:30:18,720
uh that we are at least based on the

809
00:30:18,720 --> 00:30:20,220
information that we have given them if

810
00:30:20,220 --> 00:30:21,539
we have given them enough information to

811
00:30:21,539 --> 00:30:23,340
make the right choice which hopefully is

812
00:30:23,340 --> 00:30:25,020
to code on the path of devsecop so I'll

813
00:30:25,020 --> 00:30:26,340
probably say the responsibility

814
00:30:26,340 --> 00:30:28,320
ultimately goes all the way up in the

815
00:30:28,320 --> 00:30:31,200
chain but if we are a small organization

816
00:30:31,200 --> 00:30:34,679
most likely it's with uh the CSO to

817
00:30:34,679 --> 00:30:36,960
explain it the right way to the CTO so

818
00:30:36,960 --> 00:30:40,440
ultimately a CTO is responsible for it

819
00:30:40,440 --> 00:30:42,899
and Kavita hopefully that answers your

820
00:30:42,899 --> 00:30:44,100
question thank you that is a good

821
00:30:44,100 --> 00:30:46,080
question and you know it's always the

822
00:30:46,080 --> 00:30:47,940
question for cyber security who is

823
00:30:47,940 --> 00:30:49,440
actually responsible and you know we

824
00:30:49,440 --> 00:30:51,539
often talk about shared responsibility

825
00:30:51,539 --> 00:30:53,520
and everyone being responsible for

826
00:30:53,520 --> 00:30:55,799
security but you know when um Things

827
00:30:55,799 --> 00:30:57,659
become a legal issue you know it's

828
00:30:57,659 --> 00:30:59,760
always good to have some clarity on that

829
00:30:59,760 --> 00:31:01,559
as well thank you Ashish that was a

830
00:31:01,559 --> 00:31:03,360
really good talk and a great way to kick

831
00:31:03,360 --> 00:31:05,779
things off
