thank you guys

36
00:01:16,520 --> 00:01:21,439
is most famous for yelling at Developers

37
00:01:22,580 --> 00:01:25,979
yeah that could be the meme for 2023 I

38
00:01:25,979 --> 00:01:27,659
think

39
00:01:27,659 --> 00:01:29,100
you know the the one thing I didn't

40
00:01:29,100 --> 00:01:30,360
include in the intro which would have

41
00:01:30,360 --> 00:01:31,979
been too much of a giveaway is that you

42
00:01:31,979 --> 00:01:34,740
just hosted the devset con uh apj

43
00:01:34,740 --> 00:01:36,659
session just you know eight hours ago or

44
00:01:36,659 --> 00:01:38,759
so so first of all thank you you did an

45
00:01:38,759 --> 00:01:42,060
amazing job it was so good and so fun

46
00:01:42,060 --> 00:01:45,840
thank you fun fact uh it is 4 am here in

47
00:01:45,840 --> 00:01:47,640
Australia and also this morning when I

48
00:01:47,640 --> 00:01:49,680
woke up I realized all my slides had

49
00:01:49,680 --> 00:01:52,860
crashed so that was so fun so I've had

50
00:01:52,860 --> 00:01:54,780
to so apologies if they're going to be a

51
00:01:54,780 --> 00:01:56,759
bit Scrappy but um because I've had to

52
00:01:56,759 --> 00:01:58,259
redo them all but I was like you know

53
00:01:58,259 --> 00:02:00,720
what this is exactly what uh what my

54
00:02:00,720 --> 00:02:02,880
talk is about open source and this is

55
00:02:02,880 --> 00:02:05,340
what exactly having open source

56
00:02:05,340 --> 00:02:06,659
sometimes can feel like when you find

57
00:02:06,659 --> 00:02:08,038
out there's a vulnerability and you have

58
00:02:08,038 --> 00:02:09,660
to like kind of scramble together so I'm

59
00:02:09,660 --> 00:02:11,580
in the right mindset for the talk but

60
00:02:11,580 --> 00:02:14,640
yeah it was quite a fun morning middle

61
00:02:14,640 --> 00:02:17,099
of the night let's just say that

62
00:02:17,099 --> 00:02:20,700
well sometimes thank you for uh being

63
00:02:20,700 --> 00:02:22,440
such a trooper

64
00:02:22,440 --> 00:02:24,660
absolutely

65
00:02:24,660 --> 00:02:27,000
well without further Ado everyone we're

66
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:28,800
gonna let Shelby take it away so she'll

67
00:02:28,800 --> 00:02:31,379
be thank you so much and excited to hear

68
00:02:31,379 --> 00:02:32,700
what you have to say

69
00:02:32,700 --> 00:02:35,780
amazing thank you guys

70
00:02:36,420 --> 00:02:39,000
perfect thanks everyone for joining and

71
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:41,459
as I was telling um the awesome hosting

72
00:02:41,459 --> 00:02:43,620
crew over here that this morning I did

73
00:02:43,620 --> 00:02:45,060
realize when I went into my slides that

74
00:02:45,060 --> 00:02:48,239
half of them had disappeared but

75
00:02:48,239 --> 00:02:49,680
um I said you know what let's just look

76
00:02:49,680 --> 00:02:51,180
at it as a positive and I'm gonna put

77
00:02:51,180 --> 00:02:54,239
myself in the mind frame of often what

78
00:02:54,239 --> 00:02:55,920
happens when you use open source

79
00:02:55,920 --> 00:02:57,599
software and you realize that there has

80
00:02:57,599 --> 00:02:59,640
been a vulnerability in it you know that

81
00:02:59,640 --> 00:03:01,620
can leave you scrambling for things at

82
00:03:01,620 --> 00:03:03,480
the last minute as well

83
00:03:03,480 --> 00:03:06,180
um so you know I'm sort of gonna channel

84
00:03:06,180 --> 00:03:07,739
that a little bit today and I'll

85
00:03:07,739 --> 00:03:10,140
probably put that into the ethos but um

86
00:03:10,140 --> 00:03:11,700
I think the team has done an amazing job

87
00:03:11,700 --> 00:03:13,500
of introducing me so I'm not going to go

88
00:03:13,500 --> 00:03:16,500
into a intro about me obviously if you

89
00:03:16,500 --> 00:03:18,239
look me up or Cloud security podcast you

90
00:03:18,239 --> 00:03:20,760
should be able to find me but let's get

91
00:03:20,760 --> 00:03:23,220
into it so what is open source I think

92
00:03:23,220 --> 00:03:25,860
most people attending um this talk would

93
00:03:25,860 --> 00:03:27,959
be familiar with what open source is but

94
00:03:27,959 --> 00:03:29,760
I just thought I would level the playing

95
00:03:29,760 --> 00:03:31,920
field a little bit I'm also a big Harry

96
00:03:31,920 --> 00:03:34,500
Potter fan so I've tried to put a bit of

97
00:03:34,500 --> 00:03:36,120
Harry Potter fun in there just to you

98
00:03:36,120 --> 00:03:39,300
know sort of uh keep everyone upbeat

99
00:03:39,300 --> 00:03:40,980
so open source obviously as everyone

100
00:03:40,980 --> 00:03:42,900
knows usually would be some sort of a

101
00:03:42,900 --> 00:03:44,879
source code that anyone can inspect

102
00:03:44,879 --> 00:03:47,220
modify or enhance

103
00:03:47,220 --> 00:03:48,840
um it's pretty much you know software

104
00:03:48,840 --> 00:03:51,540
that other people can improve on

105
00:03:51,540 --> 00:03:53,220
um just a couple of quick terminologies

106
00:03:53,220 --> 00:03:54,900
obviously you've got people who maintain

107
00:03:54,900 --> 00:03:57,180
it who would be the maintainers but also

108
00:03:57,180 --> 00:03:59,519
there are people you can modify or

109
00:03:59,519 --> 00:04:01,799
enhance the software and you would be

110
00:04:01,799 --> 00:04:03,780
normally classified as contributors

111
00:04:03,780 --> 00:04:05,519
there's a couple of sources that I've

112
00:04:05,519 --> 00:04:07,500
put on the bottom which have a lot of

113
00:04:07,500 --> 00:04:09,659
information about open source so if you

114
00:04:09,659 --> 00:04:12,360
do want to sort of find out more about

115
00:04:12,360 --> 00:04:14,280
Open Source you know do look those up

116
00:04:14,280 --> 00:04:15,540
and they have a lot of information in

117
00:04:15,540 --> 00:04:17,238
terms of what open source is all about

118
00:04:17,238 --> 00:04:19,918
so I will leave you to look at those

119
00:04:19,918 --> 00:04:23,280
ones um so while we go through the list

120
00:04:23,280 --> 00:04:25,680
of the um this talk I would like you to

121
00:04:25,680 --> 00:04:27,479
sort of think about this that how can

122
00:04:27,479 --> 00:04:28,979
you protect something that you haven't

123
00:04:28,979 --> 00:04:31,380
built and you don't maintain so that is

124
00:04:31,380 --> 00:04:33,840
pretty much what the mindset we've got

125
00:04:33,840 --> 00:04:35,400
to be in when we're thinking about open

126
00:04:35,400 --> 00:04:37,160
source because you're using software

127
00:04:37,160 --> 00:04:40,139
often which you obviously haven't built

128
00:04:40,139 --> 00:04:42,060
um but you're also not maintaining as

129
00:04:42,060 --> 00:04:44,160
well and you know how can you protect

130
00:04:44,160 --> 00:04:46,199
that we might feel a little bit like Ron

131
00:04:46,199 --> 00:04:48,540
Weasley there with his expression

132
00:04:48,540 --> 00:04:51,000
um so it may surprise some of you but

133
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:53,460
may not surprise some of you as well I

134
00:04:53,460 --> 00:04:54,660
think there's been a lot of talk about

135
00:04:54,660 --> 00:04:56,340
open source software this year because

136
00:04:56,340 --> 00:04:58,620
of and I'm not going to mention uh the

137
00:04:58,620 --> 00:05:02,280
word we must not mention uh so far so 70

138
00:05:02,280 --> 00:05:04,500
to 90 percent of modern application

139
00:05:04,500 --> 00:05:07,620
Stacks use open source software so as

140
00:05:07,620 --> 00:05:09,419
you can imagine that is a lot of our

141
00:05:09,419 --> 00:05:11,699
software out there currently that is

142
00:05:11,699 --> 00:05:14,400
using open source

143
00:05:14,400 --> 00:05:17,520
on the flip side it's only about nearly

144
00:05:17,520 --> 00:05:19,380
only half of organizations out there

145
00:05:19,380 --> 00:05:20,820
that actually have an open source

146
00:05:20,820 --> 00:05:23,759
security policy in place so a lot of

147
00:05:23,759 --> 00:05:25,740
Open Source software that's being

148
00:05:25,740 --> 00:05:28,199
currently used but only half of it that

149
00:05:28,199 --> 00:05:30,419
is currently being secured in

150
00:05:30,419 --> 00:05:31,979
organizations or organizations are

151
00:05:31,979 --> 00:05:36,240
thinking about policies to secure that

152
00:05:36,240 --> 00:05:38,639
so one of the reasons why people do use

153
00:05:38,639 --> 00:05:41,940
open source and um disclaimer I am a big

154
00:05:41,940 --> 00:05:43,979
supporter of Open Source I think it

155
00:05:43,979 --> 00:05:46,440
allows for a lot of innovation to happen

156
00:05:46,440 --> 00:05:48,600
a lot of collaboration to happen it

157
00:05:48,600 --> 00:05:51,360
allows a lot of um you know people to be

158
00:05:51,360 --> 00:05:52,919
able to create new things because

159
00:05:52,919 --> 00:05:54,720
they're building on something that

160
00:05:54,720 --> 00:05:56,280
that's something that's already amazing

161
00:05:56,280 --> 00:05:57,960
that's out there so there's you know if

162
00:05:57,960 --> 00:06:00,060
you look at open UK which is the body I

163
00:06:00,060 --> 00:06:02,880
think of earning open source in UK and

164
00:06:02,880 --> 00:06:05,220
looking at different things there's lots

165
00:06:05,220 --> 00:06:06,780
of really good reasons why organizations

166
00:06:06,780 --> 00:06:09,960
use open source on the flip side there

167
00:06:09,960 --> 00:06:12,479
are a lot of challenges as well that um

168
00:06:12,479 --> 00:06:14,639
organizations do have when they're using

169
00:06:14,639 --> 00:06:17,220
open source as well I think often

170
00:06:17,220 --> 00:06:19,259
something that you would hear is that

171
00:06:19,259 --> 00:06:21,360
there is a cost to using open source

172
00:06:21,360 --> 00:06:24,240
even though it is often a free software

173
00:06:24,240 --> 00:06:26,400
that you would be utilizing there is an

174
00:06:26,400 --> 00:06:28,620
inherent course in terms of things that

175
00:06:28,620 --> 00:06:29,699
you would have to put within your

176
00:06:29,699 --> 00:06:32,280
organizations be it in training or

177
00:06:32,280 --> 00:06:34,979
resources that you will have to put in

178
00:06:34,979 --> 00:06:37,080
place so I think this this slide for me

179
00:06:37,080 --> 00:06:39,060
which is out of that particular report

180
00:06:39,060 --> 00:06:40,560
and again you can check that out if you

181
00:06:40,560 --> 00:06:42,539
want in its entirety kind of summarizes

182
00:06:42,539 --> 00:06:44,699
quite well what are the top benefits and

183
00:06:44,699 --> 00:06:47,180
challenges

184
00:06:47,580 --> 00:06:49,199
so what is the real danger with open

185
00:06:49,199 --> 00:06:51,300
source software

186
00:06:51,300 --> 00:06:53,460
um obviously we know it's widely used we

187
00:06:53,460 --> 00:06:54,960
know that a lot of organizations

188
00:06:54,960 --> 00:06:57,419
probably don't have a policy in place to

189
00:06:57,419 --> 00:07:00,060
maintain it but to just to demonstrate

190
00:07:00,060 --> 00:07:01,620
and there's a lot of examples out there

191
00:07:01,620 --> 00:07:03,900
and I think earlier in the apj session

192
00:07:03,900 --> 00:07:04,979
there was actually a really good talk

193
00:07:04,979 --> 00:07:07,139
where someone actually listed out a

194
00:07:07,139 --> 00:07:08,940
GitHub repository that they've got where

195
00:07:08,940 --> 00:07:10,740
they've maintained a list of all the

196
00:07:10,740 --> 00:07:14,100
open source hacks that have happened or

197
00:07:14,100 --> 00:07:15,479
open source vulnerabilities that have

198
00:07:15,479 --> 00:07:18,240
been known in the last few years so I

199
00:07:18,240 --> 00:07:20,099
would probably plug that in later at

200
00:07:20,099 --> 00:07:22,259
some point but there have been a lot but

201
00:07:22,259 --> 00:07:24,900
I just wanted to flag a couple so this

202
00:07:24,900 --> 00:07:26,460
is one particular one and it wasn't so

203
00:07:26,460 --> 00:07:29,400
much a breach but a security researcher

204
00:07:29,400 --> 00:07:31,440
was actually able to demonstrate that he

205
00:07:31,440 --> 00:07:32,940
was able to attack a lot of these large

206
00:07:32,940 --> 00:07:35,580
companies like apple Microsoft PayPal

207
00:07:35,580 --> 00:07:38,099
and what he did is he uploaded a malware

208
00:07:38,099 --> 00:07:40,500
to a open source repository which

209
00:07:40,500 --> 00:07:43,259
included things like Pi Pi npm and Ruby

210
00:07:43,259 --> 00:07:45,479
gyms it was automatically distributed

211
00:07:45,479 --> 00:07:48,300
Downstream so what happened is anyone

212
00:07:48,300 --> 00:07:49,680
who was using this open source

213
00:07:49,680 --> 00:07:52,620
repository was able to receive this

214
00:07:52,620 --> 00:07:55,440
malicious package automatically which

215
00:07:55,440 --> 00:07:58,860
meant that you know this would um this

216
00:07:58,860 --> 00:08:00,539
would impact their open source software

217
00:08:00,539 --> 00:08:02,520
that they were utilizing

218
00:08:02,520 --> 00:08:03,780
um so this was something that they

219
00:08:03,780 --> 00:08:05,819
demonstrated now obviously this is

220
00:08:05,819 --> 00:08:07,860
something a security researcher had done

221
00:08:07,860 --> 00:08:10,139
so they did advice that you know this is

222
00:08:10,139 --> 00:08:12,180
what I've done I understand that he was

223
00:08:12,180 --> 00:08:14,940
able to get a bug Bounty for this and I

224
00:08:14,940 --> 00:08:17,340
think overall he made I think 130 000

225
00:08:17,340 --> 00:08:19,319
that's what I've learned and also an

226
00:08:19,319 --> 00:08:22,500
award from um Apple I think for sort of

227
00:08:22,500 --> 00:08:24,840
doing a responsible disclosure but that

228
00:08:24,840 --> 00:08:26,940
is the real one of the real dangers that

229
00:08:26,940 --> 00:08:30,300
just using a widely used open source

230
00:08:30,300 --> 00:08:31,800
repository

231
00:08:31,800 --> 00:08:34,500
um it can sort of you know affect a lot

232
00:08:34,500 --> 00:08:36,059
of large companies so a lot of large

233
00:08:36,059 --> 00:08:38,279
companies were using these open source

234
00:08:38,279 --> 00:08:40,020
Repository

235
00:08:40,020 --> 00:08:42,240
now he has done a really good blog as

236
00:08:42,240 --> 00:08:44,219
well on this sort of talking through you

237
00:08:44,219 --> 00:08:46,980
know his um the way he was thinking and

238
00:08:46,980 --> 00:08:48,540
how he went about it so there's a really

239
00:08:48,540 --> 00:08:50,160
nice blog I've just popped it on there

240
00:08:50,160 --> 00:08:52,019
as well so if people want to sort of go

241
00:08:52,019 --> 00:08:53,459
and have a read of it and really

242
00:08:53,459 --> 00:08:54,839
understand what went behind that attack

243
00:08:54,839 --> 00:08:57,060
that is there available for you guys as

244
00:08:57,060 --> 00:08:58,080
well

245
00:08:58,080 --> 00:09:00,360
okay so before I go into the next slide

246
00:09:00,360 --> 00:09:02,040
I think I'm just gonna give a disclaimer

247
00:09:02,040 --> 00:09:05,519
warning because I know this uh word sort

248
00:09:05,519 --> 00:09:07,200
of triggers a lot of people just because

249
00:09:07,200 --> 00:09:09,180
you know it caused so much stress to all

250
00:09:09,180 --> 00:09:11,640
of us end of last year so a little bit

251
00:09:11,640 --> 00:09:13,620
of inner peace and I'm talking about

252
00:09:13,620 --> 00:09:16,560
log4 shell so obviously log for Shell

253
00:09:16,560 --> 00:09:18,000
was something that ruined a lot of

254
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:20,700
Christmases um last year and it was a

255
00:09:20,700 --> 00:09:23,700
sort of a really good reminder that what

256
00:09:23,700 --> 00:09:25,860
um open source software when there is a

257
00:09:25,860 --> 00:09:28,860
vulnerability in there can mean for us

258
00:09:28,860 --> 00:09:30,779
um there is a really popular

259
00:09:30,779 --> 00:09:32,700
um Java logging package which is your

260
00:09:32,700 --> 00:09:35,399
Apache log 4J and that had a

261
00:09:35,399 --> 00:09:37,140
vulnerability which could allow for a

262
00:09:37,140 --> 00:09:39,540
remote code execution to happen and that

263
00:09:39,540 --> 00:09:40,920
could be done just with a single

264
00:09:40,920 --> 00:09:44,459
malicious code now um log4j is actually

265
00:09:44,459 --> 00:09:46,920
really popular there's been over 400 000

266
00:09:46,920 --> 00:09:48,959
downloads of this particular software so

267
00:09:48,959 --> 00:09:51,660
as you can imagine it is widely used and

268
00:09:51,660 --> 00:09:54,600
if you were anywhere within devsecops

269
00:09:54,600 --> 00:09:57,540
security in a developer landscape you

270
00:09:57,540 --> 00:09:59,940
would have heard about this so but I

271
00:09:59,940 --> 00:10:01,380
just thought this this really sort of

272
00:10:01,380 --> 00:10:03,480
drives home the message that there there

273
00:10:03,480 --> 00:10:05,519
can be real challenges with using open

274
00:10:05,519 --> 00:10:07,140
source

275
00:10:07,140 --> 00:10:09,420
and just in terms of the impact from an

276
00:10:09,420 --> 00:10:11,700
attack perspective there were over a

277
00:10:11,700 --> 00:10:13,680
hundred attempts um just in the early

278
00:10:13,680 --> 00:10:16,260
days every single day and in the first

279
00:10:16,260 --> 00:10:18,720
week there were about almost over 800

280
00:10:18,720 --> 00:10:20,399
000 attacks that have happened so the

281
00:10:20,399 --> 00:10:22,920
scale of Um this can be quite large

282
00:10:22,920 --> 00:10:26,100
going back to that 70 to 90 percent of

283
00:10:26,100 --> 00:10:28,620
organizations actually utilizing open

284
00:10:28,620 --> 00:10:30,480
source in their software so I think I've

285
00:10:30,480 --> 00:10:32,760
set the scene for you know why open

286
00:10:32,760 --> 00:10:34,680
source is something that we should be

287
00:10:34,680 --> 00:10:36,480
concerned about you know we've open

288
00:10:36,480 --> 00:10:37,980
sourced as I said

289
00:10:37,980 --> 00:10:40,080
um but now what

290
00:10:40,080 --> 00:10:42,300
so you can sometimes feel a little bit

291
00:10:42,300 --> 00:10:44,220
like the miffler over here losing all

292
00:10:44,220 --> 00:10:46,320
your gems uh when you know you're using

293
00:10:46,320 --> 00:10:48,000
open source and all your vulnerabilities

294
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:49,440
and you find that there is a

295
00:10:49,440 --> 00:10:50,700
vulnerability so I just thought that

296
00:10:50,700 --> 00:10:54,420
would be a good imagery to put you in

297
00:10:54,420 --> 00:10:55,920
so what are the certain things you can

298
00:10:55,920 --> 00:10:57,300
do and I think this is where you might

299
00:10:57,300 --> 00:10:59,040
start to notice my slides have gotten a

300
00:10:59,040 --> 00:11:00,240
little bit scrappier because these are

301
00:11:00,240 --> 00:11:03,120
the ones I've had to redo in the last um

302
00:11:03,120 --> 00:11:05,279
you know 10-15 minutes

303
00:11:05,279 --> 00:11:07,140
um so there's a few things out there

304
00:11:07,140 --> 00:11:09,720
currently in terms of you know sort of

305
00:11:09,720 --> 00:11:11,640
looking at open source and how do we

306
00:11:11,640 --> 00:11:13,800
sort of attack something like open

307
00:11:13,800 --> 00:11:16,500
source to be able to resolve it so the

308
00:11:16,500 --> 00:11:18,240
first thing is community collaboration

309
00:11:18,240 --> 00:11:19,320
so there's a lot of community

310
00:11:19,320 --> 00:11:21,720
collaboration that is happening there is

311
00:11:21,720 --> 00:11:24,060
open ssf which is part of the Linux

312
00:11:24,060 --> 00:11:26,100
foundation and we will go that into that

313
00:11:26,100 --> 00:11:29,519
a bit more there is Project Persia sorry

314
00:11:29,519 --> 00:11:32,040
and you can't check that out as well

315
00:11:32,040 --> 00:11:33,839
again a community collaboration looking

316
00:11:33,839 --> 00:11:37,260
at ways to improve open source also

317
00:11:37,260 --> 00:11:39,600
government bodies so the White House has

318
00:11:39,600 --> 00:11:41,640
obviously gotten involved with open

319
00:11:41,640 --> 00:11:43,560
source with their Federal mandate about

320
00:11:43,560 --> 00:11:45,660
s-bomb and as I previously mentioned

321
00:11:45,660 --> 00:11:48,720
there is also open UK that is another

322
00:11:48,720 --> 00:11:51,000
body that is looking at open source

323
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:52,440
um just being from Australia I thought

324
00:11:52,440 --> 00:11:53,700
it would be worthwhile just mentioning

325
00:11:53,700 --> 00:11:55,320
you know we do have a an open source

326
00:11:55,320 --> 00:11:56,820
industry in Australia as well that is

327
00:11:56,820 --> 00:11:59,220
looking after that as well in terms of

328
00:11:59,220 --> 00:12:01,800
tooling you know there is a few things

329
00:12:01,800 --> 00:12:03,420
that you can do to look at your open

330
00:12:03,420 --> 00:12:05,579
source so you can use static code

331
00:12:05,579 --> 00:12:08,399
analysis a tool like maybe sneak and you

332
00:12:08,399 --> 00:12:10,500
can complement that with a test or

333
00:12:10,500 --> 00:12:12,060
assessed which is your dynamic or a

334
00:12:12,060 --> 00:12:13,940
static application security testing

335
00:12:13,940 --> 00:12:16,560
there are lots of really good Frameworks

336
00:12:16,560 --> 00:12:18,120
that are coming through so if you have

337
00:12:18,120 --> 00:12:21,420
been watching this since apj we did have

338
00:12:21,420 --> 00:12:23,160
actually a talk about the salsa

339
00:12:23,160 --> 00:12:25,200
framework and someone who actually went

340
00:12:25,200 --> 00:12:28,079
into the complementary guac as well so

341
00:12:28,079 --> 00:12:29,640
that is another framework that you know

342
00:12:29,640 --> 00:12:31,140
a lot of companies have been utilizing

343
00:12:31,140 --> 00:12:32,880
to sort of look at their open source and

344
00:12:32,880 --> 00:12:35,519
how do they manage that there is also a

345
00:12:35,519 --> 00:12:37,980
secure software architecture from cncf

346
00:12:37,980 --> 00:12:39,779
so for the purposes of this token

347
00:12:39,779 --> 00:12:42,120
because it is a 30 minute talk I would

348
00:12:42,120 --> 00:12:43,800
love to sort of go into all of these but

349
00:12:43,800 --> 00:12:45,899
you know there just isn't enough time to

350
00:12:45,899 --> 00:12:48,180
do it justice so I will just be focusing

351
00:12:48,180 --> 00:12:53,700
on openssf so open ssf is a governing

352
00:12:53,700 --> 00:12:55,620
body that that has come together really

353
00:12:55,620 --> 00:12:57,120
with a lot of as you can see

354
00:12:57,120 --> 00:12:58,980
organizations that have decided you know

355
00:12:58,980 --> 00:13:00,600
what we do need to do something about

356
00:13:00,600 --> 00:13:02,760
open source open source is something

357
00:13:02,760 --> 00:13:04,680
that is being widely used within our

358
00:13:04,680 --> 00:13:05,700
community

359
00:13:05,700 --> 00:13:07,260
and this is something that we need to

360
00:13:07,260 --> 00:13:08,700
really come together as a community to

361
00:13:08,700 --> 00:13:11,160
address that and you can see all these

362
00:13:11,160 --> 00:13:13,440
companies have come together to sort of

363
00:13:13,440 --> 00:13:15,480
take a few initiatives to Target you

364
00:13:15,480 --> 00:13:17,160
know how do we make sure that the open

365
00:13:17,160 --> 00:13:19,260
source software that we're utilizing in

366
00:13:19,260 --> 00:13:21,860
our programs in our software are secure

367
00:13:21,860 --> 00:13:24,480
and I do encourage you guys to just sort

368
00:13:24,480 --> 00:13:26,399
of go and look at open source they have

369
00:13:26,399 --> 00:13:28,139
a website which talks a lot about that

370
00:13:28,139 --> 00:13:32,040
but what they have put in place is this

371
00:13:32,040 --> 00:13:34,079
um this plan which is called the open

372
00:13:34,079 --> 00:13:36,180
source software security mobilization

373
00:13:36,180 --> 00:13:37,560
plan

374
00:13:37,560 --> 00:13:39,720
um now if you look at the components of

375
00:13:39,720 --> 00:13:41,880
it there are 10 components in there and

376
00:13:41,880 --> 00:13:43,740
all of it kind of would make sense to

377
00:13:43,740 --> 00:13:45,300
you so there is things like you know

378
00:13:45,300 --> 00:13:48,120
security education looking at risk

379
00:13:48,120 --> 00:13:50,760
assessment looking at the adoption of

380
00:13:50,760 --> 00:13:53,040
digital signatures and and I know we've

381
00:13:53,040 --> 00:13:55,440
had a talk um in the apj session and I

382
00:13:55,440 --> 00:13:57,480
know Randall who introduced

383
00:13:57,480 --> 00:14:00,240
um me as well he did a talk on you know

384
00:14:00,240 --> 00:14:02,820
what digital signature and code signing

385
00:14:02,820 --> 00:14:05,100
does mean and you know how it what it

386
00:14:05,100 --> 00:14:07,399
does mean for you your software as well

387
00:14:07,399 --> 00:14:11,399
about memory safety incident response

388
00:14:11,399 --> 00:14:14,060
doing better scanning and code audits

389
00:14:14,060 --> 00:14:17,459
data sharing let's just talk about

390
00:14:17,459 --> 00:14:19,560
s-bomb and that as well and also

391
00:14:19,560 --> 00:14:21,600
improved software Supply chains there

392
00:14:21,600 --> 00:14:23,160
there is a bit to go in there and they

393
00:14:23,160 --> 00:14:25,380
actually do have a entire report that

394
00:14:25,380 --> 00:14:27,300
talks through it now just for the

395
00:14:27,300 --> 00:14:28,860
purposes of this talk you know I would

396
00:14:28,860 --> 00:14:30,660
love to sort of dissect each and every

397
00:14:30,660 --> 00:14:32,339
part of this but I've decided to sort of

398
00:14:32,339 --> 00:14:34,980
pick three top things

399
00:14:34,980 --> 00:14:36,480
um I think we're going to be talking

400
00:14:36,480 --> 00:14:38,579
about digital signatures so you know

401
00:14:38,579 --> 00:14:40,639
what can we do with digital signatures

402
00:14:40,639 --> 00:14:43,800
to secure our open source software we're

403
00:14:43,800 --> 00:14:45,360
going to be talking about code audits

404
00:14:45,360 --> 00:14:47,519
things you can do with your code to

405
00:14:47,519 --> 00:14:49,860
secure your open source and also I know

406
00:14:49,860 --> 00:14:52,139
everyone's probably heard s-bombs quite

407
00:14:52,139 --> 00:14:54,120
a bit but I think I truly believe it's a

408
00:14:54,120 --> 00:14:55,620
conversation that needs to keep

409
00:14:55,620 --> 00:14:57,600
happening so we will sort of delve into

410
00:14:57,600 --> 00:14:59,279
s-bombs as well so those are the three

411
00:14:59,279 --> 00:15:01,800
components from the open source software

412
00:15:01,800 --> 00:15:03,899
security mobilization plan that we'll be

413
00:15:03,899 --> 00:15:05,760
focusing on

414
00:15:05,760 --> 00:15:07,800
so the first one is the digital

415
00:15:07,800 --> 00:15:10,800
signature of software so all the open

416
00:15:10,800 --> 00:15:13,199
source software that you consume in your

417
00:15:13,199 --> 00:15:15,540
organization you need to know that what

418
00:15:15,540 --> 00:15:17,459
you're consuming is exactly what you're

419
00:15:17,459 --> 00:15:20,279
in you're intending to use it for when

420
00:15:20,279 --> 00:15:23,100
someone creates a particular software

421
00:15:23,100 --> 00:15:24,779
um then it's modified often the

422
00:15:24,779 --> 00:15:27,000
challenges that you do not know what the

423
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:28,680
modifications have been and if you were

424
00:15:28,680 --> 00:15:30,360
intending to use that software for a

425
00:15:30,360 --> 00:15:31,980
particular reason have there been any

426
00:15:31,980 --> 00:15:35,519
changes so what the open ssf is

427
00:15:35,519 --> 00:15:37,440
suggesting and they're proposing is they

428
00:15:37,440 --> 00:15:39,480
want to drive some improvement of these

429
00:15:39,480 --> 00:15:42,240
existing signing tools now if you were

430
00:15:42,240 --> 00:15:45,000
at qcon earlier this year you may have

431
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:46,800
heard about Sig store

432
00:15:46,800 --> 00:15:48,899
um which is now generally available so

433
00:15:48,899 --> 00:15:50,160
that is one of the tools that is

434
00:15:50,160 --> 00:15:52,139
available and it's really encouraging

435
00:15:52,139 --> 00:15:54,000
that adoption of these open source

436
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:56,579
projects to make sure that you know you

437
00:15:56,579 --> 00:15:58,079
know what open source software you're

438
00:15:58,079 --> 00:16:00,480
using who was the author of that and

439
00:16:00,480 --> 00:16:01,860
what are the changes that have been made

440
00:16:01,860 --> 00:16:03,720
for that open source software now

441
00:16:03,720 --> 00:16:04,980
they're hoping to do this through

442
00:16:04,980 --> 00:16:06,360
various different ways is obviously

443
00:16:06,360 --> 00:16:08,760
adoption of tools is one but also things

444
00:16:08,760 --> 00:16:10,260
like you know training for the

445
00:16:10,260 --> 00:16:11,699
maintainers who are a very very

446
00:16:11,699 --> 00:16:13,800
important part of this and I think

447
00:16:13,800 --> 00:16:16,199
um I really resonated with something

448
00:16:16,199 --> 00:16:18,180
um that was said at the kubecon keynote

449
00:16:18,180 --> 00:16:21,360
that we don't give enough support and

450
00:16:21,360 --> 00:16:22,800
probably credit to a lot of these

451
00:16:22,800 --> 00:16:24,180
maintainers who are you know sort of

452
00:16:24,180 --> 00:16:26,100
maintaining these open source softwares

453
00:16:26,100 --> 00:16:28,680
you know as a side project and out of a

454
00:16:28,680 --> 00:16:30,899
labor of love so just doing more support

455
00:16:30,899 --> 00:16:33,060
and training for that

456
00:16:33,060 --> 00:16:35,279
um also the goal is they are looking at

457
00:16:35,279 --> 00:16:37,259
the top 200 projects that are being

458
00:16:37,259 --> 00:16:39,959
utilized across the board in various

459
00:16:39,959 --> 00:16:41,279
different organizations and something

460
00:16:41,279 --> 00:16:43,380
like I love 4J would have been part of

461
00:16:43,380 --> 00:16:46,019
that and looking at ways to improve

462
00:16:46,019 --> 00:16:49,139
software signing for those softwares so

463
00:16:49,139 --> 00:16:50,279
that is one thing that has been

464
00:16:50,279 --> 00:16:53,000
recommended

465
00:16:54,199 --> 00:16:57,120
the other one is about third-party code

466
00:16:57,120 --> 00:16:58,620
reviews

467
00:16:58,620 --> 00:17:01,620
um so we're looking again at the most

468
00:17:01,620 --> 00:17:04,199
um critical open source software by

469
00:17:04,199 --> 00:17:06,660
having third-party firms do sort of a

470
00:17:06,660 --> 00:17:09,359
code review for these and you know doing

471
00:17:09,359 --> 00:17:11,160
a report that would be available for

472
00:17:11,160 --> 00:17:13,140
everyone to find so if you're using a

473
00:17:13,140 --> 00:17:15,179
particular open source you will be able

474
00:17:15,179 --> 00:17:17,699
to look at that report and understand

475
00:17:17,699 --> 00:17:19,079
you know are there any vulnerabilities

476
00:17:19,079 --> 00:17:21,480
that I need to know of they are hoping

477
00:17:21,480 --> 00:17:24,119
to cover the top 50 in the first year so

478
00:17:24,119 --> 00:17:25,559
that's what they're currently working on

479
00:17:25,559 --> 00:17:27,359
but the intention is that in the next

480
00:17:27,359 --> 00:17:28,860
two and a half years they'll cover the

481
00:17:28,860 --> 00:17:31,020
top 200. so you will be able to sort of

482
00:17:31,020 --> 00:17:32,520
go back to this public report that

483
00:17:32,520 --> 00:17:34,500
they're going to publish to be able to

484
00:17:34,500 --> 00:17:38,039
see okay if I'm using say a log4j what

485
00:17:38,039 --> 00:17:40,020
what does that code look like are they

486
00:17:40,020 --> 00:17:41,580
certain things that I need to be aware

487
00:17:41,580 --> 00:17:44,240
of as well

488
00:17:45,900 --> 00:17:47,700
perfect

489
00:17:47,700 --> 00:17:50,880
and again s form so I think I know I did

490
00:17:50,880 --> 00:17:53,460
say this in the apj um session as well

491
00:17:53,460 --> 00:17:55,559
but I I've been told that if you say s

492
00:17:55,559 --> 00:17:58,559
Bond three times in 2022 a genie appears

493
00:17:58,559 --> 00:18:01,440
so I'm gonna see if that Genie appears

494
00:18:01,440 --> 00:18:02,580
for me

495
00:18:02,580 --> 00:18:05,160
um s-bomb for anyone who isn't familiar

496
00:18:05,160 --> 00:18:06,480
which I would I don't think there'll be

497
00:18:06,480 --> 00:18:08,700
many people in uh in this cohort but

498
00:18:08,700 --> 00:18:11,100
it's just a software bill of materials I

499
00:18:11,100 --> 00:18:12,780
know one of the speakers before

500
00:18:12,780 --> 00:18:14,520
um give an example of it being a recipe

501
00:18:14,520 --> 00:18:17,220
of a chocolate chip cookie so it's just

502
00:18:17,220 --> 00:18:19,140
pretty much everything that goes into

503
00:18:19,140 --> 00:18:21,179
your software what is the ingredient

504
00:18:21,179 --> 00:18:23,400
list as a lot of people have tried to

505
00:18:23,400 --> 00:18:25,799
sort of explain it that way and they are

506
00:18:25,799 --> 00:18:27,960
proposing that we need to do things to

507
00:18:27,960 --> 00:18:30,539
improve as bomb tooling and training to

508
00:18:30,539 --> 00:18:32,400
drive the adoption

509
00:18:32,400 --> 00:18:35,039
um a lot of companies are providing s

510
00:18:35,039 --> 00:18:37,500
forms these days but just in terms of

511
00:18:37,500 --> 00:18:39,059
you know what the qualities of those

512
00:18:39,059 --> 00:18:41,400
s-bombs is and how organizations are

513
00:18:41,400 --> 00:18:43,740
actually utilizing that s-bomb at the

514
00:18:43,740 --> 00:18:45,539
moment I think a lot of organizations

515
00:18:45,539 --> 00:18:47,280
are still sort of looking at s-bombs

516
00:18:47,280 --> 00:18:49,200
going yes if I do

517
00:18:49,200 --> 00:18:51,179
find that there is a log for Shell

518
00:18:51,179 --> 00:18:52,860
happening and I know one of my

519
00:18:52,860 --> 00:18:55,799
software's uses a log4j I can go back to

520
00:18:55,799 --> 00:18:58,220
that so there is that simple sort of

521
00:18:58,220 --> 00:19:00,539
trajectory that people are mapping out

522
00:19:00,539 --> 00:19:02,160
but I think what they're proposing is

523
00:19:02,160 --> 00:19:04,140
that a little bit more sophistication so

524
00:19:04,140 --> 00:19:06,860
working with developers to improve that

525
00:19:06,860 --> 00:19:10,320
tooling also sort of baking in security

526
00:19:10,320 --> 00:19:13,500
into a lot of those open source software

527
00:19:13,500 --> 00:19:15,000
as well and sort of baking in that

528
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:17,760
s-bomb there's also a talk about a lot

529
00:19:17,760 --> 00:19:19,679
of Education to happen in that space as

530
00:19:19,679 --> 00:19:21,240
well so they've proposed things like you

531
00:19:21,240 --> 00:19:23,220
know training having different templates

532
00:19:23,220 --> 00:19:24,660
and pace and obviously Community

533
00:19:24,660 --> 00:19:27,120
advocacy so just normalizing that

534
00:19:27,120 --> 00:19:29,400
everyone who's creating open source or

535
00:19:29,400 --> 00:19:32,640
any software is creating s-bombs and

536
00:19:32,640 --> 00:19:35,100
also sort of consuming it now s-spom is

537
00:19:35,100 --> 00:19:37,080
something that is mandated in the US by

538
00:19:37,080 --> 00:19:38,400
the federal government for anyone who's

539
00:19:38,400 --> 00:19:39,600
wanting to sell to the federal

540
00:19:39,600 --> 00:19:41,940
government but it is something that is

541
00:19:41,940 --> 00:19:44,039
being advocated in other countries as

542
00:19:44,039 --> 00:19:46,919
well so in UK there's open UK in

543
00:19:46,919 --> 00:19:48,059
Australia as well the government

544
00:19:48,059 --> 00:19:50,460
actually encourages companies to have

545
00:19:50,460 --> 00:19:52,860
response and utilize that

546
00:19:52,860 --> 00:19:54,840
so that's all well and good I know these

547
00:19:54,840 --> 00:19:56,100
are initiatives that we're talking about

548
00:19:56,100 --> 00:19:57,600
and the reasons why I wanted to mention

549
00:19:57,600 --> 00:20:00,179
these is that for organizations if you

550
00:20:00,179 --> 00:20:01,820
are working with open source software

551
00:20:01,820 --> 00:20:04,020
this is these are the kind of things you

552
00:20:04,020 --> 00:20:06,000
do want to be thinking about you do want

553
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:08,160
to think about your s-bomb from the

554
00:20:08,160 --> 00:20:09,720
software that you're consuming but also

555
00:20:09,720 --> 00:20:11,400
software that you might be Distributing

556
00:20:11,400 --> 00:20:13,380
you do want to make sure that the

557
00:20:13,380 --> 00:20:16,260
software that you're using has been

558
00:20:16,260 --> 00:20:18,120
signed there is that code signing in

559
00:20:18,120 --> 00:20:19,919
place to make sure that the Integrity of

560
00:20:19,919 --> 00:20:22,320
that software is good and you also want

561
00:20:22,320 --> 00:20:24,000
to look at things like code audits so at

562
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:26,880
the moment I know open ssf the report is

563
00:20:26,880 --> 00:20:28,799
not out there but you can be doing

564
00:20:28,799 --> 00:20:31,080
certain things to do that code audit as

565
00:20:31,080 --> 00:20:33,120
I mentioned things like you know static

566
00:20:33,120 --> 00:20:34,440
code analysis

567
00:20:34,440 --> 00:20:35,580
um and if you want to you know

568
00:20:35,580 --> 00:20:39,419
complement that with a test or assessed

569
00:20:39,419 --> 00:20:42,900
so this is something that the open

570
00:20:42,900 --> 00:20:45,539
um ssf actually have on the website but

571
00:20:45,539 --> 00:20:47,280
this is something called The Open Source

572
00:20:47,280 --> 00:20:49,200
program office and there is a lot to go

573
00:20:49,200 --> 00:20:50,760
through but I thought from my

574
00:20:50,760 --> 00:20:52,740
perspective um this is a good takeaway

575
00:20:52,740 --> 00:20:55,380
slide um that I had in mind and if as an

576
00:20:55,380 --> 00:20:57,240
organization you're looking at this and

577
00:20:57,240 --> 00:21:00,660
going okay am I really using 70 of my

578
00:21:00,660 --> 00:21:03,419
software is open source and a lot of

579
00:21:03,419 --> 00:21:05,340
organizations don't realize how much of

580
00:21:05,340 --> 00:21:07,919
their software might be open source

581
00:21:07,919 --> 00:21:09,900
um you may be thinking okay you know I

582
00:21:09,900 --> 00:21:11,280
appreciate that something like an open

583
00:21:11,280 --> 00:21:13,559
ssf is working on this projects but what

584
00:21:13,559 --> 00:21:14,700
are the certain things that I can do

585
00:21:14,700 --> 00:21:16,799
today to be able to sort of you know

586
00:21:16,799 --> 00:21:18,120
look at these things because you know I

587
00:21:18,120 --> 00:21:20,160
cannot be waiting say a year to start

588
00:21:20,160 --> 00:21:22,559
doing certain things and I think this

589
00:21:22,559 --> 00:21:24,660
slide that they've got over there

590
00:21:24,660 --> 00:21:26,460
um you know kind of summarizes it quite

591
00:21:26,460 --> 00:21:28,620
well so these are real actionable things

592
00:21:28,620 --> 00:21:31,020
that you can put in place today to look

593
00:21:31,020 --> 00:21:32,880
at how you can improve your open source

594
00:21:32,880 --> 00:21:34,860
security so obviously focusing on

595
00:21:34,860 --> 00:21:36,659
education I think it's one of those

596
00:21:36,659 --> 00:21:38,220
really simple things that we often talk

597
00:21:38,220 --> 00:21:40,080
about but it's

598
00:21:40,080 --> 00:21:41,760
um definitely not to be underrated you

599
00:21:41,760 --> 00:21:43,919
know talking about this within your

600
00:21:43,919 --> 00:21:45,720
organization and making sure that

601
00:21:45,720 --> 00:21:47,460
everyone understands what the

602
00:21:47,460 --> 00:21:49,320
implications of opening using open

603
00:21:49,320 --> 00:21:51,480
source it definitely allows you to move

604
00:21:51,480 --> 00:21:54,000
faster and innovate but on the flip side

605
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:55,559
we do need to know what the cost of

606
00:21:55,559 --> 00:21:57,480
doing that is multi-factor

607
00:21:57,480 --> 00:21:59,039
authentication I know we had a really

608
00:21:59,039 --> 00:22:01,140
good talk from OCTA about that as well

609
00:22:01,140 --> 00:22:02,820
again that is one of those things that

610
00:22:02,820 --> 00:22:04,500
you know it's worthwhile implementing

611
00:22:04,500 --> 00:22:06,960
just making sure things are secure

612
00:22:06,960 --> 00:22:09,120
you're using a combination of tools in

613
00:22:09,120 --> 00:22:10,620
your pipeline to detect these

614
00:22:10,620 --> 00:22:12,840
vulnerabilities so openssf actually has

615
00:22:12,840 --> 00:22:15,360
a guide for security tools so if you go

616
00:22:15,360 --> 00:22:16,440
on there you know they kind of talk

617
00:22:16,440 --> 00:22:18,299
about different tools but the takeaway

618
00:22:18,299 --> 00:22:20,460
messages you know no tool is perfect it

619
00:22:20,460 --> 00:22:22,500
kind of has to complement you know the

620
00:22:22,500 --> 00:22:23,760
culture that you've got within your

621
00:22:23,760 --> 00:22:25,559
organization and what you're using it

622
00:22:25,559 --> 00:22:28,380
for so there wouldn't be one tool um

623
00:22:28,380 --> 00:22:30,539
fits all in this case but you know that

624
00:22:30,539 --> 00:22:32,580
is something that you can do we spoke

625
00:22:32,580 --> 00:22:34,440
about you know adopting something like a

626
00:22:34,440 --> 00:22:37,500
six door or a code signing as well

627
00:22:37,500 --> 00:22:38,880
um the software bill of material

628
00:22:38,880 --> 00:22:40,440
adoption

629
00:22:40,440 --> 00:22:42,360
um then you want to obviously monitor

630
00:22:42,360 --> 00:22:44,340
your overall health of the open source

631
00:22:44,340 --> 00:22:45,900
projects that you're using as well so

632
00:22:45,900 --> 00:22:48,120
the Linux Foundation actually has this

633
00:22:48,120 --> 00:22:50,039
thing called LFX that you can utilize

634
00:22:50,039 --> 00:22:52,740
and they also have a chaos toolkit so

635
00:22:52,740 --> 00:22:54,600
yes what I'll probably do is so I did

636
00:22:54,600 --> 00:22:56,880
have a resource slide at the end of this

637
00:22:56,880 --> 00:22:59,100
but obviously as I've had this great

638
00:22:59,100 --> 00:23:01,799
experience today I will um pop these

639
00:23:01,799 --> 00:23:03,780
resources into the devsecond Discord

640
00:23:03,780 --> 00:23:05,520
Channel um you know all the resources

641
00:23:05,520 --> 00:23:07,380
that you can kind of go into to to be

642
00:23:07,380 --> 00:23:09,120
able to sort of you know look at all

643
00:23:09,120 --> 00:23:10,500
this information and implement it in

644
00:23:10,500 --> 00:23:13,260
your organization there are also some

645
00:23:13,260 --> 00:23:15,299
really great guidelines that are

646
00:23:15,299 --> 00:23:18,659
available as well so in a nutshell I

647
00:23:18,659 --> 00:23:20,580
think um what I wanted to really sort of

648
00:23:20,580 --> 00:23:23,520
wrap up with is open source is great I

649
00:23:23,520 --> 00:23:26,220
am very supportive of people utilizing

650
00:23:26,220 --> 00:23:29,220
open source it is great for Innovation

651
00:23:29,220 --> 00:23:31,980
um but it does come with its own cost

652
00:23:31,980 --> 00:23:33,360
and there are some great initiatives

653
00:23:33,360 --> 00:23:35,100
that are happening across the board and

654
00:23:35,100 --> 00:23:37,140
of open ssf being one of the big ones

655
00:23:37,140 --> 00:23:39,539
out there currently so I do encourage

656
00:23:39,539 --> 00:23:41,159
everyone to go check that out look at

657
00:23:41,159 --> 00:23:43,440
their open mobilization plan I've only

658
00:23:43,440 --> 00:23:45,240
obviously flagged only three of the

659
00:23:45,240 --> 00:23:46,500
components but I think each of the

660
00:23:46,500 --> 00:23:47,880
components that they're speaking about

661
00:23:47,880 --> 00:23:49,860
and I will kind of maybe just flick back

662
00:23:49,860 --> 00:23:53,159
to that are equally important and I do

663
00:23:53,159 --> 00:23:54,840
encourage everyone to look at that and

664
00:23:54,840 --> 00:23:56,940
sort of implementing something like that

665
00:23:56,940 --> 00:24:00,120
within their organizations

666
00:24:00,120 --> 00:24:03,678
thank you so much for everyone's time

667
00:24:06,299 --> 00:24:08,400
well Shelby thank you so much for that

668
00:24:08,400 --> 00:24:11,340
presentation that was incredible

669
00:24:11,340 --> 00:24:13,919
thank you I hopefully I did all right

670
00:24:13,919 --> 00:24:15,480
for time I was trying to kind of keep a

671
00:24:15,480 --> 00:24:18,900
track on am I going over or not you're

672
00:24:18,900 --> 00:24:21,000
fantastic yep

673
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:22,980
this is this is how I imagine you say

674
00:24:22,980 --> 00:24:23,930
F-bomb

675
00:24:23,930 --> 00:24:24,980
[Laughter]

676
00:24:24,980 --> 00:24:27,780
yes I I was trying to sort of you know

677
00:24:27,780 --> 00:24:29,820
like maybe not say s-bomb enough I think

678
00:24:29,820 --> 00:24:31,860
there's like few buzzwords for 2022

679
00:24:31,860 --> 00:24:33,419
which you know you kind of like don't

680
00:24:33,419 --> 00:24:35,220
want to say it but I think that they I

681
00:24:35,220 --> 00:24:36,720
think someone said that you know things

682
00:24:36,720 --> 00:24:38,640
are buzzword for a reason sometimes and

683
00:24:38,640 --> 00:24:41,460
I think I spons one of them yeah yeah

684
00:24:41,460 --> 00:24:43,080
and bringing up Vlog for Shell so close

685
00:24:43,080 --> 00:24:45,059
to the holidays again or so close to

686
00:24:45,059 --> 00:24:47,840
that anniversary yeah

687
00:24:52,740 --> 00:24:54,179
yeah one of the things I always find

688
00:24:54,179 --> 00:24:56,220
super just fascinating about open source

689
00:24:56,220 --> 00:24:59,400
and Security in general is uh I I think

690
00:24:59,400 --> 00:25:01,080
about this often but like apparently and

691
00:25:01,080 --> 00:25:02,460
I just Google this to make sure I'm not

692
00:25:02,460 --> 00:25:04,380
going to give anyone some fake uh

693
00:25:04,380 --> 00:25:07,140
information here but Isaac Newton is the

694
00:25:07,140 --> 00:25:09,840
one who said if I have seen further It

695
00:25:09,840 --> 00:25:11,220
Is by standing on the shoulders of

696
00:25:11,220 --> 00:25:12,480
giants which is one of my favorite

697
00:25:12,480 --> 00:25:14,820
quotes of all time and I feel like in

698
00:25:14,820 --> 00:25:16,559
the software world it's like one of the

699
00:25:16,559 --> 00:25:18,500
most relevant things to you know

700
00:25:18,500 --> 00:25:21,240
literally everything we do because you

701
00:25:21,240 --> 00:25:22,380
know when you're building applications

702
00:25:22,380 --> 00:25:24,779
today you're using so much work that

703
00:25:24,779 --> 00:25:26,340
people that have come before you have

704
00:25:26,340 --> 00:25:28,559
built and it's all just open source

705
00:25:28,559 --> 00:25:30,539
stuff all the way down to the kernels of

706
00:25:30,539 --> 00:25:31,620
the operating systems that you're

707
00:25:31,620 --> 00:25:33,539
working on most of the time and it's

708
00:25:33,539 --> 00:25:35,580
just so impressive how much like the

709
00:25:35,580 --> 00:25:37,380
collective human knowledge and like

710
00:25:37,380 --> 00:25:38,880
sharing of that knowledge has like

711
00:25:38,880 --> 00:25:40,620
enabled for today's stuff

712
00:25:40,620 --> 00:25:42,240
but it doesn't come without risk and

713
00:25:42,240 --> 00:25:43,380
there's all sorts of things you need to

714
00:25:43,380 --> 00:25:45,960
do to use those tools in nice ways and

715
00:25:45,960 --> 00:25:47,159
make sure you're not like breaking

716
00:25:47,159 --> 00:25:48,659
things and causing problems but

717
00:25:48,659 --> 00:25:51,000
absolutely loved your presentation

718
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:52,679
thank you so much

719
00:25:52,679 --> 00:25:55,679
yeah 100 I see in in over on the hop-in

720
00:25:55,679 --> 00:25:58,140
platform Hannah said that's fantastic

721
00:25:58,140 --> 00:26:00,779
talk as well she'll be however and is a

722
00:26:00,779 --> 00:26:01,980
little disappointed and I agree with

723
00:26:01,980 --> 00:26:03,720
Hannah there was no Genie that popped up

724
00:26:03,720 --> 00:26:05,580
when you said s-bomb three uh I know I

725
00:26:05,580 --> 00:26:07,020
was hoping for that I think one of these

726
00:26:07,020 --> 00:26:08,760
days maybe I need to save 10 times I

727
00:26:08,760 --> 00:26:12,299
think maybe it's not three yeah

728
00:26:12,299 --> 00:26:15,900
ask any other questions for Shelby

729
00:26:15,900 --> 00:26:18,000
I think I have a genie image here we go

730
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:19,159
I

731
00:26:19,159 --> 00:26:21,600
love that

732
00:26:21,600 --> 00:26:23,100
I think I'll leave that for my next talk

733
00:26:23,100 --> 00:26:24,960
the third time I say it you know Brian

734
00:26:24,960 --> 00:26:27,059
Club pops up

735
00:26:27,059 --> 00:26:29,580
the beardless Brian Clark also we gotta

736
00:26:29,580 --> 00:26:31,500
talk about Micah's uh photoshopping

737
00:26:31,500 --> 00:26:33,120
skills there because I don't know what

738
00:26:33,120 --> 00:26:35,100
he did to my face but it looked really

739
00:26:35,100 --> 00:26:37,820
copy and everything

740
00:26:38,059 --> 00:26:41,178
you know

741
00:26:41,860 --> 00:26:45,740

749
00:27:06,720 --> 00:27:08,159

755
