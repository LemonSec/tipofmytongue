1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
so Chris hey Chris welcome hey how's it

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:05,279
going glad to be here

3
00:00:05,279 --> 00:00:07,620
oh great here all good hope hope you are

4
00:00:07,620 --> 00:00:10,019
ready so um let's uh pop up your your

5
00:00:10,019 --> 00:00:11,820
screen I have it here in the back that's

6
00:00:11,820 --> 00:00:14,099
great and I would just simply say the

7
00:00:14,099 --> 00:00:18,060
floor is yours hit it

8
00:00:18,060 --> 00:00:19,859
hey how's it going Chris Russell I'm

9
00:00:19,859 --> 00:00:21,720
gonna be doing a talk here called apps

10
00:00:21,720 --> 00:00:23,160
like for everyone this is really kind of

11
00:00:23,160 --> 00:00:25,019
stuff foundational

12
00:00:25,019 --> 00:00:25,859
um

13
00:00:25,859 --> 00:00:28,859
bass uh kind of talk on some of the best

14
00:00:28,859 --> 00:00:31,800
practices from the pitfalls uh some of

15
00:00:31,800 --> 00:00:33,480
the ways to to get things off the ground

16
00:00:33,480 --> 00:00:36,120
for leaders and and some of the other uh

17
00:00:36,120 --> 00:00:38,940
non-technical stakeholders

18
00:00:38,940 --> 00:00:40,440
so

19
00:00:40,440 --> 00:00:43,020
right off the bat

20
00:00:43,020 --> 00:00:44,700
here's the contents of what we'll be

21
00:00:44,700 --> 00:00:47,219
going through why opsat components

22
00:00:47,219 --> 00:00:48,960
Evolution Trends best practices pitfalls

23
00:00:48,960 --> 00:00:50,879
inclusions and questions

24
00:00:50,879 --> 00:00:53,280
route to back why appsec um now you're

25
00:00:53,280 --> 00:00:54,480
on this you're you know you're on the

26
00:00:54,480 --> 00:00:55,500
stream so obviously you know something

27
00:00:55,500 --> 00:00:57,360
about appsec you know something about uh

28
00:00:57,360 --> 00:01:00,480
devsecops you know signatures of yours

29
00:01:00,480 --> 00:01:02,100
um but let's really talk about like why

30
00:01:02,100 --> 00:01:03,719
this is exploding right now uh

31
00:01:03,719 --> 00:01:05,580
previously there was a small amount of

32
00:01:05,580 --> 00:01:08,939
organizations that were in appsec uh or

33
00:01:08,939 --> 00:01:11,760
developing apps at all uh you know it

34
00:01:11,760 --> 00:01:13,920
was you know just Silicone Valley type

35
00:01:13,920 --> 00:01:16,920
companies but now we're seeing this kind

36
00:01:16,920 --> 00:01:18,900
of everywhere and that and now that all

37
00:01:18,900 --> 00:01:20,460
organizations are dealing with apps and

38
00:01:20,460 --> 00:01:22,439
different you know things to support

39
00:01:22,439 --> 00:01:25,259
their services uh you know this it you

40
00:01:25,259 --> 00:01:26,340
know introduces a host of different

41
00:01:26,340 --> 00:01:28,080
security you know issues and things that

42
00:01:28,080 --> 00:01:30,479
people can care of so appsec were you

43
00:01:30,479 --> 00:01:31,979
know taking best practices security

44
00:01:31,979 --> 00:01:34,140
software Hardware techniques putting

45
00:01:34,140 --> 00:01:35,640
this all together trying to protect

46
00:01:35,640 --> 00:01:37,079
their computers from any sort of

47
00:01:37,079 --> 00:01:39,360
external threats uh any sort of insecure

48
00:01:39,360 --> 00:01:40,740
application can be exploited

49
00:01:40,740 --> 00:01:42,659
fraudulently you know we're gonna you

50
00:01:42,659 --> 00:01:45,060
know this concludes lead to you know

51
00:01:45,060 --> 00:01:48,420
data infiltration or exfiltration

52
00:01:48,420 --> 00:01:49,640
um Financial

53
00:01:49,640 --> 00:01:52,979
crypto exfiltration proprietary data

54
00:01:52,979 --> 00:01:55,380
being stolen customer data Pi you know

55
00:01:55,380 --> 00:01:56,880
all the things that we want to avoid and

56
00:01:56,880 --> 00:01:58,320
we're trying to protect against

57
00:01:58,320 --> 00:02:01,200
I'm also kind of feel like fraud and

58
00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:02,759
cyber security kind of come together in

59
00:02:02,759 --> 00:02:04,740
this in this regard these things have

60
00:02:04,740 --> 00:02:06,299
previously been very distinguishing up

61
00:02:06,299 --> 00:02:09,119
in organizations and I'm seeing uh fraud

62
00:02:09,119 --> 00:02:12,060
teams and infosec teams in regards to

63
00:02:12,060 --> 00:02:13,200
apps like having to work a little bit

64
00:02:13,200 --> 00:02:14,760
closer together because of the fraud

65
00:02:14,760 --> 00:02:17,420
aspect of it

66
00:02:17,940 --> 00:02:19,500
um now like I was saying before

67
00:02:19,500 --> 00:02:21,420
everyone's got an app now even if you

68
00:02:21,420 --> 00:02:22,800
have a toaster they're going to give you

69
00:02:22,800 --> 00:02:25,260
an app as a you know a support service

70
00:02:25,260 --> 00:02:27,840
you can do it from bad or whatnot so

71
00:02:27,840 --> 00:02:29,160
we're seeing just an explosion of

72
00:02:29,160 --> 00:02:30,840
companies that have never been in apps

73
00:02:30,840 --> 00:02:32,819
before uh getting involved in the space

74
00:02:32,819 --> 00:02:34,260
now a lot of people Outsource it and

75
00:02:34,260 --> 00:02:36,180
that's fine but a lot of people want to

76
00:02:36,180 --> 00:02:38,520
do this in-house and so they're you know

77
00:02:38,520 --> 00:02:40,440
they push out their MVP they they do

78
00:02:40,440 --> 00:02:41,819
what they got to do to kind of get that

79
00:02:41,819 --> 00:02:43,680
off the ground but they you know they

80
00:02:43,680 --> 00:02:45,060
were you know faking security and after

81
00:02:45,060 --> 00:02:46,440
the fact we all know that's just not a

82
00:02:46,440 --> 00:02:48,420
recipe for Success so we want to do is

83
00:02:48,420 --> 00:02:49,860
bake it in early you know I've once

84
00:02:49,860 --> 00:02:51,180
heard shift last that's what we're

85
00:02:51,180 --> 00:02:52,739
really shooting for

86
00:02:52,739 --> 00:02:54,060
um and some of these new organizations

87
00:02:54,060 --> 00:02:55,379
that are getting into it now they're

88
00:02:55,379 --> 00:02:57,120
actually at an advantage because

89
00:02:57,120 --> 00:02:58,980
previously it was a very manual process

90
00:02:58,980 --> 00:03:00,660
there weren't a lot of tools that helped

91
00:03:00,660 --> 00:03:01,860
automate it there wasn't a lot of

92
00:03:01,860 --> 00:03:03,959
support to create a great CI CD pipeline

93
00:03:03,959 --> 00:03:05,400
it was very

94
00:03:05,400 --> 00:03:07,680
um it was it just wasn't smooth and

95
00:03:07,680 --> 00:03:08,940
efficient because we just didn't have

96
00:03:08,940 --> 00:03:10,379
the tools so now people getting into it

97
00:03:10,379 --> 00:03:12,780
they can actually get through and do the

98
00:03:12,780 --> 00:03:14,580
fundamentals of apps like a lot easier

99
00:03:14,580 --> 00:03:17,879
than before just you know just even last

100
00:03:17,879 --> 00:03:19,980
five years what we have available now

101
00:03:19,980 --> 00:03:22,260
makes you know putting apps like in the

102
00:03:22,260 --> 00:03:25,019
CD pipelines super easy

103
00:03:25,019 --> 00:03:26,640
so let's go through

104
00:03:26,640 --> 00:03:29,840
some of the components of appsec for

105
00:03:29,840 --> 00:03:33,540
pipelines so first of all like any other

106
00:03:33,540 --> 00:03:35,340
you know any other programming off the

107
00:03:35,340 --> 00:03:36,659
ground you need to kind of do your

108
00:03:36,659 --> 00:03:38,099
research you need to understand your

109
00:03:38,099 --> 00:03:39,780
organization you need to understand how

110
00:03:39,780 --> 00:03:41,159
you support your organization and go

111
00:03:41,159 --> 00:03:43,200
collect information on that but on top

112
00:03:43,200 --> 00:03:44,940
of that you want to talk to the teams

113
00:03:44,940 --> 00:03:46,560
involved do you want to talk to the

114
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:47,580
people are going to be using this

115
00:03:47,580 --> 00:03:49,620
day-to-day and really understand their

116
00:03:49,620 --> 00:03:51,659
workflow understand their release cycle

117
00:03:51,659 --> 00:03:53,400
all these things because what you want

118
00:03:53,400 --> 00:03:55,440
to do again is is support the company's

119
00:03:55,440 --> 00:03:58,440
ability to deliver apps and not make

120
00:03:58,440 --> 00:04:00,659
security a roadblock as soon as it's a

121
00:04:00,659 --> 00:04:02,220
roadblock people are getting around it

122
00:04:02,220 --> 00:04:04,140
people are not going to buy into it and

123
00:04:04,140 --> 00:04:05,819
your program is going to be at risk of

124
00:04:05,819 --> 00:04:07,379
just not not function the way it's

125
00:04:07,379 --> 00:04:08,819
supposed to be

126
00:04:08,819 --> 00:04:10,200
so let's talk about some of the

127
00:04:10,200 --> 00:04:11,879
components there's a stakeholder

128
00:04:11,879 --> 00:04:13,080
Communications like you said you're

129
00:04:13,080 --> 00:04:14,280
about to roll something out you're about

130
00:04:14,280 --> 00:04:15,840
to insert something else into someone's

131
00:04:15,840 --> 00:04:17,399
process you need to talk to the people

132
00:04:17,399 --> 00:04:18,779
involved in that so they understand this

133
00:04:18,779 --> 00:04:20,880
is coming you need a threat model

134
00:04:20,880 --> 00:04:22,260
so we understand what we're looking at

135
00:04:22,260 --> 00:04:24,180
as far as vulnerabilities what are

136
00:04:24,180 --> 00:04:26,400
companies priorities are you know fit

137
00:04:26,400 --> 00:04:27,479
that into it you got to do an

138
00:04:27,479 --> 00:04:29,160
application inventory so you know you're

139
00:04:29,160 --> 00:04:30,780
covering all your applications if you're

140
00:04:30,780 --> 00:04:33,900
only doing some sort of opsec for 20 of

141
00:04:33,900 --> 00:04:35,759
your organization you're not really you

142
00:04:35,759 --> 00:04:37,020
know you're not really covering what you

143
00:04:37,020 --> 00:04:39,240
need to cover application Architects you

144
00:04:39,240 --> 00:04:40,500
understand kind of how everything's

145
00:04:40,500 --> 00:04:41,280
built together how everything

146
00:04:41,280 --> 00:04:42,720
intertwined what services talk together

147
00:04:42,720 --> 00:04:44,699
what workloads talk together program

148
00:04:44,699 --> 00:04:47,880
strategy again you know as as a CSO I

149
00:04:47,880 --> 00:04:48,780
have to sit down and think like what's

150
00:04:48,780 --> 00:04:49,979
the strategy or program what's the

151
00:04:49,979 --> 00:04:51,120
ultimate outcome we're trying to get to

152
00:04:51,120 --> 00:04:53,220
you need some assessment tools older

153
00:04:53,220 --> 00:04:54,840
mailing management documentation and

154
00:04:54,840 --> 00:04:57,679
continuous Improvement

155
00:04:57,900 --> 00:04:59,100
let's talk about some of the building

156
00:04:59,100 --> 00:05:01,440
blocks for upsec now you know again my

157
00:05:01,440 --> 00:05:03,360
view is that almost all organizations

158
00:05:03,360 --> 00:05:06,000
have to kind of tailor fit their

159
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:08,100
um their program to like to support the

160
00:05:08,100 --> 00:05:09,300
organization you can't just cookie

161
00:05:09,300 --> 00:05:11,460
cutter and copy paste what someone else

162
00:05:11,460 --> 00:05:12,960
is doing otherwise it's just not going

163
00:05:12,960 --> 00:05:14,759
to fit but there's these building blocks

164
00:05:14,759 --> 00:05:16,080
and you can use these interchangeably

165
00:05:16,080 --> 00:05:17,699
just to kind of build out what you you

166
00:05:17,699 --> 00:05:20,220
know you need for for your work

167
00:05:20,220 --> 00:05:21,780
um

168
00:05:21,780 --> 00:05:24,960
the you know the secure uh

169
00:05:24,960 --> 00:05:27,900
software development life cycle get CSD

170
00:05:27,900 --> 00:05:29,759
pipeline containers infrastructure code

171
00:05:29,759 --> 00:05:31,979
the SAS stats and all different scanning

172
00:05:31,979 --> 00:05:33,960
tools uh and some pen tests these are

173
00:05:33,960 --> 00:05:35,580
things you can take together to build a

174
00:05:35,580 --> 00:05:37,320
pretty good asset program like I said

175
00:05:37,320 --> 00:05:40,020
you know where you put these in the

176
00:05:40,020 --> 00:05:41,940
process if you're pen testing first if

177
00:05:41,940 --> 00:05:43,979
you're pen testing continuously

178
00:05:43,979 --> 00:05:45,180
um you know that that's all really

179
00:05:45,180 --> 00:05:47,639
dependent on the workflow of your of

180
00:05:47,639 --> 00:05:49,620
your developers and your organization

181
00:05:49,620 --> 00:05:51,360
but you know these are just some of the

182
00:05:51,360 --> 00:05:52,560
main components you need to be familiar

183
00:05:52,560 --> 00:05:55,380
with and ready to hopefully utilizing to

184
00:05:55,380 --> 00:05:58,639
secure your apps

185
00:05:58,680 --> 00:06:02,460
let's talk about the evolution of appsec

186
00:06:02,460 --> 00:06:03,900
you know it was like I mentioned before

187
00:06:03,900 --> 00:06:05,940
it was a lot harder before that it is

188
00:06:05,940 --> 00:06:07,800
now so before there's a lot of manual

189
00:06:07,800 --> 00:06:10,259
code review it was very cumbersome time

190
00:06:10,259 --> 00:06:12,120
consuming it took not just developer

191
00:06:12,120 --> 00:06:13,800
time but senior developer time to sit

192
00:06:13,800 --> 00:06:16,380
down and look at Junior developers work

193
00:06:16,380 --> 00:06:18,960
it's very costly and inefficient way of

194
00:06:18,960 --> 00:06:20,820
doing it then we moved to the

195
00:06:20,820 --> 00:06:22,800
spreadsheet for you know spreadsheets

196
00:06:22,800 --> 00:06:24,539
for days we were taking stuff from the

197
00:06:24,539 --> 00:06:25,680
code review putting out all these

198
00:06:25,680 --> 00:06:28,199
spreadsheets tracking vulnerabilities

199
00:06:28,199 --> 00:06:30,120
with these spreadsheets that would just

200
00:06:30,120 --> 00:06:33,660
become just ever longer because you know

201
00:06:33,660 --> 00:06:35,880
it's such an inefficient system you just

202
00:06:35,880 --> 00:06:37,380
keep adding to the vulnerabilities keep

203
00:06:37,380 --> 00:06:38,940
adding to the issues and you're very

204
00:06:38,940 --> 00:06:40,500
little you know not chipping away at

205
00:06:40,500 --> 00:06:42,600
them very well because it's you know you

206
00:06:42,600 --> 00:06:43,979
don't have any sort of automated process

207
00:06:43,979 --> 00:06:45,479
whereas these days you can have

208
00:06:45,479 --> 00:06:47,460
automated merge requests and reports and

209
00:06:47,460 --> 00:06:49,199
all these things automatic remediations

210
00:06:49,199 --> 00:06:51,240
it doesn't you can't automate everything

211
00:06:51,240 --> 00:06:52,979
but you can automate enough of the small

212
00:06:52,979 --> 00:06:55,199
pieces that you freeze you up to kind of

213
00:06:55,199 --> 00:06:56,759
then do the stuff you need to do to

214
00:06:56,759 --> 00:07:00,120
tackle the more uh one-offs and harder

215
00:07:00,120 --> 00:07:02,400
things that you need to improve for that

216
00:07:02,400 --> 00:07:04,139
so you know things like patching and

217
00:07:04,139 --> 00:07:06,180
whatnot it doesn't have to be cumbersome

218
00:07:06,180 --> 00:07:10,319
now like it was just even five years ago

219
00:07:10,319 --> 00:07:11,639
let's talk about some of the trends

220
00:07:11,639 --> 00:07:13,500
right now in app sec

221
00:07:13,500 --> 00:07:15,240
so

222
00:07:15,240 --> 00:07:17,520
um like I mentioned before previously

223
00:07:17,520 --> 00:07:19,139
very cumbersome very manual now we're

224
00:07:19,139 --> 00:07:21,120
starting to embed tools into the devops

225
00:07:21,120 --> 00:07:22,259
teams

226
00:07:22,259 --> 00:07:23,639
um we're talking you know container

227
00:07:23,639 --> 00:07:25,979
security uh containers first came out

228
00:07:25,979 --> 00:07:28,560
there wasn't a lot of thought products

229
00:07:28,560 --> 00:07:30,900
or kind of knowledge around how to you

230
00:07:30,900 --> 00:07:32,240
know Harden the containers

231
00:07:32,240 --> 00:07:34,380
infrastructure is a code security again

232
00:07:34,380 --> 00:07:36,060
if you know terraform comes out

233
00:07:36,060 --> 00:07:37,800
everyone's using it but no one's really

234
00:07:37,800 --> 00:07:40,139
sitting down and other than manually

235
00:07:40,139 --> 00:07:41,759
kind of reviewing things and then pen

236
00:07:41,759 --> 00:07:43,139
testing afterwards

237
00:07:43,139 --> 00:07:45,060
thinking about infrastructure of the

238
00:07:45,060 --> 00:07:47,699
code security itself is there hard-coded

239
00:07:47,699 --> 00:07:49,080
secrets in there is there things that

240
00:07:49,080 --> 00:07:51,479
you know just don't need to be in the

241
00:07:51,479 --> 00:07:54,120
interest in the in the code itself or

242
00:07:54,120 --> 00:07:55,800
you know need to be you know referenced

243
00:07:55,800 --> 00:07:57,240
definitely

244
00:07:57,240 --> 00:07:58,740
um these are all relatively new things

245
00:07:58,740 --> 00:08:00,240
that make this one more secure but even

246
00:08:00,240 --> 00:08:01,620
just a couple years ago was very manual

247
00:08:01,620 --> 00:08:02,340
process

248
00:08:02,340 --> 00:08:04,259
uh you want to aggregate a volt

249
00:08:04,259 --> 00:08:06,780
management process again there's

250
00:08:06,780 --> 00:08:09,000
scanners and different types of owner

251
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:10,620
management tools it seems like you might

252
00:08:10,620 --> 00:08:11,880
have to have two or three to cover all

253
00:08:11,880 --> 00:08:13,500
aspects of it that's starting to get

254
00:08:13,500 --> 00:08:15,360
Consolidated and that's a good sign for

255
00:08:15,360 --> 00:08:17,819
for overall process

256
00:08:17,819 --> 00:08:20,580
um SAS and Das integration again fund

257
00:08:20,580 --> 00:08:22,740
these various to be you know not very

258
00:08:22,740 --> 00:08:24,960
great tools in the last 10 years now

259
00:08:24,960 --> 00:08:26,400
they're becoming amazing and now they're

260
00:08:26,400 --> 00:08:27,780
starting to get integrated and kind of

261
00:08:27,780 --> 00:08:29,840
do more than just one piece of the pie

262
00:08:29,840 --> 00:08:33,419
continuous Cloud app monitoring again

263
00:08:33,419 --> 00:08:35,580
since everything in the clouds an API

264
00:08:35,580 --> 00:08:37,620
call you know a lot of products to

265
00:08:37,620 --> 00:08:38,880
figure out it's very easy to kind of

266
00:08:38,880 --> 00:08:40,320
figure out every single thing that's

267
00:08:40,320 --> 00:08:42,000
happened every single action and

268
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:43,740
monitoring that to a good degree whether

269
00:08:43,740 --> 00:08:46,680
it's AWS gcp Azure

270
00:08:46,680 --> 00:08:48,360
um there's a ton of different ways to

271
00:08:48,360 --> 00:08:51,000
plug into every single thing that's

272
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:52,860
going on your environment via API and

273
00:08:52,860 --> 00:08:56,160
getting some really rich good use case

274
00:08:56,160 --> 00:08:58,200
alerts on when things are kind of

275
00:08:58,200 --> 00:08:59,700
deviation from the norm or clear

276
00:08:59,700 --> 00:09:01,920
violations of some rules you have set up

277
00:09:01,920 --> 00:09:04,860
API security API security is another one

278
00:09:04,860 --> 00:09:06,779
where a lot of people barely had API

279
00:09:06,779 --> 00:09:09,480
documentation barely had schemas never

280
00:09:09,480 --> 00:09:11,700
mind any sort of security around it now

281
00:09:11,700 --> 00:09:13,320
that you know people like Melissa and I

282
00:09:13,320 --> 00:09:14,940
have gone through and

283
00:09:14,940 --> 00:09:16,860
um you know shown how easily they can

284
00:09:16,860 --> 00:09:19,740
hack financial institutions via apis uh

285
00:09:19,740 --> 00:09:21,540
they start to see a lot of uh you know

286
00:09:21,540 --> 00:09:23,640
process talk Tools around this and I

287
00:09:23,640 --> 00:09:25,380
think that's a really great thing uh

288
00:09:25,380 --> 00:09:29,220
functional appsec testing again

289
00:09:29,220 --> 00:09:30,899
not something in the past that was super

290
00:09:30,899 --> 00:09:32,279
prevalent now we got you know probably

291
00:09:32,279 --> 00:09:34,500
got tons of options on tools how you can

292
00:09:34,500 --> 00:09:35,279
do that

293
00:09:35,279 --> 00:09:37,320
curated vulnerability list now this is

294
00:09:37,320 --> 00:09:38,640
something that isn't necessarily a

295
00:09:38,640 --> 00:09:40,260
product this is something that I kind of

296
00:09:40,260 --> 00:09:42,300
preach the way I feel is when you have

297
00:09:42,300 --> 00:09:44,519
an appsec program the security team

298
00:09:44,519 --> 00:09:48,320
should be basically curating uh the the

299
00:09:48,320 --> 00:09:50,640
vulnerabilities for the developers so

300
00:09:50,640 --> 00:09:52,560
they don't have to figure out themselves

301
00:09:52,560 --> 00:09:54,720
what the priorities are so you don't

302
00:09:54,720 --> 00:09:56,459
just sit there and run something like

303
00:09:56,459 --> 00:09:58,860
sneak get okay there's you know 10

304
00:09:58,860 --> 00:10:02,399
criticals 20 highs you know 40 you know

305
00:10:02,399 --> 00:10:03,600
mediums

306
00:10:03,600 --> 00:10:04,980
um you don't just send them a list of

307
00:10:04,980 --> 00:10:06,839
that and say go go do good things you

308
00:10:06,839 --> 00:10:08,279
need to sit there you know especially at

309
00:10:08,279 --> 00:10:10,500
first and okay of all these things these

310
00:10:10,500 --> 00:10:11,640
are the ones that you can remediate

311
00:10:11,640 --> 00:10:12,839
these are the ones that have known

312
00:10:12,839 --> 00:10:14,700
exploits these are the ones that blah

313
00:10:14,700 --> 00:10:16,320
blah blah and you actually curate and

314
00:10:16,320 --> 00:10:18,779
give them like a prioritized list so

315
00:10:18,779 --> 00:10:20,940
they know where to tackle first if they

316
00:10:20,940 --> 00:10:22,440
have limited time if they only 10

317
00:10:22,440 --> 00:10:25,019
they're Sprint cycle they know and so

318
00:10:25,019 --> 00:10:26,580
security teams really got to kind of

319
00:10:26,580 --> 00:10:28,440
pick up the slack on that

320
00:10:28,440 --> 00:10:31,080
um and give guidance to the developers

321
00:10:31,080 --> 00:10:32,940
over time the developers May pick up on

322
00:10:32,940 --> 00:10:34,320
it they may be able to kind of run with

323
00:10:34,320 --> 00:10:36,000
it but the security team gotta at least

324
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:37,519
get that off the ground

325
00:10:37,519 --> 00:10:40,620
that's becoming more real time again

326
00:10:40,620 --> 00:10:42,480
there's usually some delays on that but

327
00:10:42,480 --> 00:10:44,339
now that we have continuous kind of

328
00:10:44,339 --> 00:10:46,380
dynamic testing that can go on in

329
00:10:46,380 --> 00:10:47,880
real-time environments we get a lot more

330
00:10:47,880 --> 00:10:50,940
updated faster kind of intel on on

331
00:10:50,940 --> 00:10:52,680
what's vulnerable on environment that's

332
00:10:52,680 --> 00:10:54,660
a really good thing

333
00:10:54,660 --> 00:10:55,740
let's talk about some of the best

334
00:10:55,740 --> 00:10:59,160
practices start small everyone wants to

335
00:10:59,160 --> 00:11:01,140
plug in a tool automate everything and

336
00:11:01,140 --> 00:11:02,820
what they end up doing is end up

337
00:11:02,820 --> 00:11:04,260
automating a lot of noise end up

338
00:11:04,260 --> 00:11:05,820
alienating a lot of people because all

339
00:11:05,820 --> 00:11:07,260
of a sudden they've got whether it's

340
00:11:07,260 --> 00:11:08,820
email alerts or slack alerts or whatever

341
00:11:08,820 --> 00:11:10,560
it is they end up getting bombarded with

342
00:11:10,560 --> 00:11:12,480
okay you've got 12 000 vulnerabilities

343
00:11:12,480 --> 00:11:13,920
because the first time you plug this in

344
00:11:13,920 --> 00:11:15,959
that's just going to turn people off so

345
00:11:15,959 --> 00:11:18,300
start small start with a couple projects

346
00:11:18,300 --> 00:11:20,240
start with a small amount of people

347
00:11:20,240 --> 00:11:22,800
clean up the noise before you start just

348
00:11:22,800 --> 00:11:24,959
pushing it out wide like I have Release

349
00:11:24,959 --> 00:11:27,839
Control it's kind of fundamental a lot

350
00:11:27,839 --> 00:11:30,300
of people don't have any sort of uh or I

351
00:11:30,300 --> 00:11:31,260
would say a lot of people a lot of

352
00:11:31,260 --> 00:11:33,000
people kind of fudge the the process on

353
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:34,560
that and kind of have some workarounds

354
00:11:34,560 --> 00:11:36,120
try to keep that strict so that

355
00:11:36,120 --> 00:11:38,279
everything's you know through the

356
00:11:38,279 --> 00:11:40,200
pipeline and you don't have ways of

357
00:11:40,200 --> 00:11:42,300
having a side branch or something else

358
00:11:42,300 --> 00:11:44,519
that can still go to prod continuous

359
00:11:44,519 --> 00:11:47,160
Improvement whether it's fail fast or

360
00:11:47,160 --> 00:11:49,740
whatever your mythology is you want to

361
00:11:49,740 --> 00:11:51,660
be able to you know fix things and

362
00:11:51,660 --> 00:11:53,040
innovate really fast you want a nice

363
00:11:53,040 --> 00:11:54,899
clean pipeline that you know you can run

364
00:11:54,899 --> 00:11:57,540
run you know through tests to staging

365
00:11:57,540 --> 00:11:59,760
the prod really quickly but also hit all

366
00:11:59,760 --> 00:12:01,500
your Security checks

367
00:12:01,500 --> 00:12:03,779
define success early and often you know

368
00:12:03,779 --> 00:12:05,339
as far as the opsec program you got to

369
00:12:05,339 --> 00:12:08,339
have a goal you know and it's not just

370
00:12:08,339 --> 00:12:10,500
be secure because that's you know that's

371
00:12:10,500 --> 00:12:12,000
too vague you got to talk about

372
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:14,519
specifically in our org this is what our

373
00:12:14,519 --> 00:12:17,160
goal is for q1 with our appsec program

374
00:12:17,160 --> 00:12:18,360
especially if you're just saying off the

375
00:12:18,360 --> 00:12:20,459
ground we want to reduce developer Time

376
00:12:20,459 --> 00:12:23,339
by you know developer you know patch

377
00:12:23,339 --> 00:12:24,779
management Time by this we want to

378
00:12:24,779 --> 00:12:26,339
reduce whatever it is have specific

379
00:12:26,339 --> 00:12:28,019
goals so you can define success and

380
00:12:28,019 --> 00:12:30,300
communicate those to leaders uh and

381
00:12:30,300 --> 00:12:32,279
above all support developers

382
00:12:32,279 --> 00:12:34,140
um again this this is something that

383
00:12:34,140 --> 00:12:35,640
makes a lot more work for them they're

384
00:12:35,640 --> 00:12:36,899
just going to find ways around it it's

385
00:12:36,899 --> 00:12:39,240
kind of human nature

386
00:12:39,240 --> 00:12:41,160
some of the pitfalls

387
00:12:41,160 --> 00:12:43,320
automating everything first again

388
00:12:43,320 --> 00:12:45,180
um it's it's a it's second nature if we

389
00:12:45,180 --> 00:12:47,339
can automate it let's do that but uh

390
00:12:47,339 --> 00:12:48,720
until you understand it until you

391
00:12:48,720 --> 00:12:50,220
understand ramifications on your channel

392
00:12:50,220 --> 00:12:51,959
scope of what you're setting up God made

393
00:12:51,959 --> 00:12:54,000
everything you might end up pushing some

394
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:55,860
patches ended up breaking things because

395
00:12:55,860 --> 00:12:57,600
you don't have an attached other

396
00:12:57,600 --> 00:13:00,480
dependencies or whatever it is so start

397
00:13:00,480 --> 00:13:02,639
off walking you know or crawling crawl

398
00:13:02,639 --> 00:13:04,620
walk run is my this kind of my take on

399
00:13:04,620 --> 00:13:07,079
on anytime anything with us

400
00:13:07,079 --> 00:13:09,480
um don't overwhelm developers if you're

401
00:13:09,480 --> 00:13:11,880
not prioritizing bones you might have

402
00:13:11,880 --> 00:13:13,800
people spending time a lot of time

403
00:13:13,800 --> 00:13:15,839
fixing things that aren't even really a

404
00:13:15,839 --> 00:13:17,760
concern compared to things that are you

405
00:13:17,760 --> 00:13:20,160
know more critical so you have to have

406
00:13:20,160 --> 00:13:21,839
prioritization in there it can't just be

407
00:13:21,839 --> 00:13:23,459
a list of thousands of homes and they

408
00:13:23,459 --> 00:13:25,079
have to figure it out I'm not

409
00:13:25,079 --> 00:13:26,639
considering mitigating controls there

410
00:13:26,639 --> 00:13:28,800
are some things that um

411
00:13:28,800 --> 00:13:31,800
you know are so locked down by 10 other

412
00:13:31,800 --> 00:13:33,360
controls the security team can say you

413
00:13:33,360 --> 00:13:34,860
know what this one can take a minute to

414
00:13:34,860 --> 00:13:36,779
you can patch this later we can upgrade

415
00:13:36,779 --> 00:13:37,920
this later we can upgrade the

416
00:13:37,920 --> 00:13:39,540
dependencies later on this because not

417
00:13:39,540 --> 00:13:41,339
only is this behind the WAFF and the

418
00:13:41,339 --> 00:13:43,800
palatal firewall and it's got EDR on it

419
00:13:43,800 --> 00:13:45,540
and I've got you know 10 other tools on

420
00:13:45,540 --> 00:13:47,279
it the likelihood of this vulnerability

421
00:13:47,279 --> 00:13:49,200
you've been executing because it's you

422
00:13:49,200 --> 00:13:51,180
know whatever it is is totally mitigated

423
00:13:51,180 --> 00:13:53,459
by these other controls so it you know

424
00:13:53,459 --> 00:13:55,800
appsec is a is still a section of your

425
00:13:55,800 --> 00:13:57,480
over on Social Security and make sure

426
00:13:57,480 --> 00:13:58,620
you're thinking about what else you have

427
00:13:58,620 --> 00:14:00,660
around it and taking you know and taking

428
00:14:00,660 --> 00:14:03,000
and using that in your uh your

429
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:05,100
assessment not knowing what apps you

430
00:14:05,100 --> 00:14:07,200
have that's you know again comes down to

431
00:14:07,200 --> 00:14:08,639
the basics of internal security have

432
00:14:08,639 --> 00:14:10,200
some sort of asset inventory in this

433
00:14:10,200 --> 00:14:12,360
case it's your apps uh not working with

434
00:14:12,360 --> 00:14:13,560
product again you need to understand

435
00:14:13,560 --> 00:14:15,060
what your product's trying to achieve

436
00:14:15,060 --> 00:14:16,740
and understand the goal of the product

437
00:14:16,740 --> 00:14:18,600
team they need to support them because

438
00:14:18,600 --> 00:14:19,680
if it's no product there's no

439
00:14:19,680 --> 00:14:21,240
infrastruct team if those info 16

440
00:14:21,240 --> 00:14:24,180
there's an optic program

441
00:14:24,180 --> 00:14:26,220
um kindling too much technical debt this

442
00:14:26,220 --> 00:14:28,380
is a very common one again sometimes

443
00:14:28,380 --> 00:14:31,260
because you come in as a new leader and

444
00:14:31,260 --> 00:14:32,579
all of a sudden you plug in some tools

445
00:14:32,579 --> 00:14:33,779
and you find out that things haven't

446
00:14:33,779 --> 00:14:36,600
been updated in a very long time

447
00:14:36,600 --> 00:14:38,459
um work to do that but then set up a

448
00:14:38,459 --> 00:14:39,660
program you don't find yourself in those

449
00:14:39,660 --> 00:14:40,860
shoes again

450
00:14:40,860 --> 00:14:42,779
death back so spreadsheets I find a lot

451
00:14:42,779 --> 00:14:44,699
of times we have all these great fancy

452
00:14:44,699 --> 00:14:46,500
tools that they've got great reports and

453
00:14:46,500 --> 00:14:47,519
we're still pulling everything into

454
00:14:47,519 --> 00:14:49,620
Excel spreadsheets

455
00:14:49,620 --> 00:14:51,959
um I prefer like hey give people links

456
00:14:51,959 --> 00:14:54,180
to the actual report give people links

457
00:14:54,180 --> 00:14:56,459
to the actual alert don't start creating

458
00:14:56,459 --> 00:14:58,860
a whole other system to track systems

459
00:14:58,860 --> 00:15:00,060
that are trackable within themselves

460
00:15:00,060 --> 00:15:01,199
trying to take advantage of those

461
00:15:01,199 --> 00:15:02,940
because people don't like manually

462
00:15:02,940 --> 00:15:04,740
cutting and pasting things into a sheet

463
00:15:04,740 --> 00:15:07,260
if you can export something so work with

464
00:15:07,260 --> 00:15:08,339
that

465
00:15:08,339 --> 00:15:09,660
um not having a process for emergency

466
00:15:09,660 --> 00:15:11,940
prod pushes again if your pipeline's

467
00:15:11,940 --> 00:15:13,380
still kind of backed up with all these

468
00:15:13,380 --> 00:15:15,839
processes you can't you can't have a way

469
00:15:15,839 --> 00:15:17,279
to get someone through an emergency to

470
00:15:17,279 --> 00:15:18,720
get yourself back up during you know

471
00:15:18,720 --> 00:15:21,480
trading hours or you know e-commerce

472
00:15:21,480 --> 00:15:23,339
site during business hours

473
00:15:23,339 --> 00:15:26,040
um then then the company starts losing a

474
00:15:26,040 --> 00:15:27,660
lot of money because there's so many

475
00:15:27,660 --> 00:15:30,300
gates for security to get to prod to fix

476
00:15:30,300 --> 00:15:31,860
that then you're going to find yourself

477
00:15:31,860 --> 00:15:34,079
at risk of of losing some of that

478
00:15:34,079 --> 00:15:36,360
because you have to you know support the

479
00:15:36,360 --> 00:15:39,300
business first above above all important

480
00:15:39,300 --> 00:15:41,459
documentation you know you you may have

481
00:15:41,459 --> 00:15:43,019
a really great process and then you may

482
00:15:43,019 --> 00:15:45,240
lose one or two key people an architect

483
00:15:45,240 --> 00:15:47,820
a senior devops person and all of a

484
00:15:47,820 --> 00:15:48,620
sudden

485
00:15:48,620 --> 00:15:51,480
there's lost tribal knowledge and no one

486
00:15:51,480 --> 00:15:52,620
knows how to fix something in the

487
00:15:52,620 --> 00:15:54,420
pipeline because there's one one-off on

488
00:15:54,420 --> 00:15:56,579
certain thing and that just leads to

489
00:15:56,579 --> 00:15:58,500
failure so definitely focus on

490
00:15:58,500 --> 00:16:00,720
documentation

491
00:16:00,720 --> 00:16:03,300
so in conclusion

492
00:16:03,300 --> 00:16:05,519
start with Basics fully improve programs

493
00:16:05,519 --> 00:16:07,440
over time consider the time required for

494
00:16:07,440 --> 00:16:09,120
the developers and product team username

495
00:16:09,120 --> 00:16:10,860
as a team as a curator what's important

496
00:16:10,860 --> 00:16:12,600
to not enable other teams to embrace

497
00:16:12,600 --> 00:16:15,360
secure development practices and with

498
00:16:15,360 --> 00:16:17,459
that I am done

499
00:16:17,459 --> 00:16:20,180
foreign

500
00:16:23,880 --> 00:16:26,399
I think there's there's one question and

501
00:16:26,399 --> 00:16:28,680
that is probably an opinion here

502
00:16:28,680 --> 00:16:31,560
um if there were three uh top metrics

503
00:16:31,560 --> 00:16:33,420
people should monitor what would they be

504
00:16:33,420 --> 00:16:35,519
what is what is your take on that

505
00:16:35,519 --> 00:16:37,139
oh

506
00:16:37,139 --> 00:16:39,600
um I I'm gonna say it's pretty org

507
00:16:39,600 --> 00:16:41,220
specific but you know I'll sit there and

508
00:16:41,220 --> 00:16:43,680
kind of figure out generically

509
00:16:43,680 --> 00:16:46,139
um I would say

510
00:16:46,139 --> 00:16:47,399
um you gotta have something around

511
00:16:47,399 --> 00:16:50,459
timing on your your uh your merge

512
00:16:50,459 --> 00:16:52,560
request process something around timing

513
00:16:52,560 --> 00:16:54,360
as far as

514
00:16:54,360 --> 00:16:55,019
um

515
00:16:55,019 --> 00:16:57,360
you know is there any delays to

516
00:16:57,360 --> 00:16:59,519
developers being able to to push their

517
00:16:59,519 --> 00:17:01,500
stuff to test staging and prod

518
00:17:01,500 --> 00:17:03,120
um you gotta you gotta see where the you

519
00:17:03,120 --> 00:17:04,619
have metrics around where it's getting

520
00:17:04,619 --> 00:17:07,079
caught up in that process uh to make

521
00:17:07,079 --> 00:17:09,240
sure that there's no you know one part

522
00:17:09,240 --> 00:17:10,380
in there that's kind of weaker than

523
00:17:10,380 --> 00:17:12,720
others that that there's just loss and

524
00:17:12,720 --> 00:17:14,579
efficient time

525
00:17:14,579 --> 00:17:18,000
um I would say uh overall I don't want

526
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:20,760
to say things like vulnerabilities uh

527
00:17:20,760 --> 00:17:22,799
over time but something that shows that

528
00:17:22,799 --> 00:17:25,439
you're actually decreasing the amount of

529
00:17:25,439 --> 00:17:27,359
total loans environment as opposed to

530
00:17:27,359 --> 00:17:29,520
just constantly adding and a losing

531
00:17:29,520 --> 00:17:32,460
scale I remember years ago I was dealing

532
00:17:32,460 --> 00:17:33,960
with kind of people in a different you

533
00:17:33,960 --> 00:17:35,340
know situation it's not necessarily

534
00:17:35,340 --> 00:17:38,640
upset uh but the the the the list of

535
00:17:38,640 --> 00:17:40,320
vulnerabilities just always increased

536
00:17:40,320 --> 00:17:43,200
and and the the the customer is dealing

537
00:17:43,200 --> 00:17:45,720
with was chipping away to like 10 it was

538
00:17:45,720 --> 00:17:48,120
going up by like 20 and I sat down and

539
00:17:48,120 --> 00:17:49,260
said to him like look we need to

540
00:17:49,260 --> 00:17:50,760
fundamentally change how we're

541
00:17:50,760 --> 00:17:52,500
approaching this because if the list is

542
00:17:52,500 --> 00:17:53,640
getting longer and we're only chipping

543
00:17:53,640 --> 00:17:54,720
everybody slowly we'll just it's just

544
00:17:54,720 --> 00:17:56,640
gonna you know not only you're showing

545
00:17:56,640 --> 00:17:57,840
not progress you're showing negative

546
00:17:57,840 --> 00:17:58,980
process and that's not going to be a

547
00:17:58,980 --> 00:18:00,299
good story for you and your leaders so

548
00:18:00,299 --> 00:18:03,419
somebody show improvements there

549
00:18:03,419 --> 00:18:04,080
um

550
00:18:04,080 --> 00:18:06,900
lastly

551
00:18:06,900 --> 00:18:08,880
um

552
00:18:08,880 --> 00:18:11,400
I would say something around

553
00:18:11,400 --> 00:18:12,360
um

554
00:18:12,360 --> 00:18:15,240
something around how efficient your

555
00:18:15,240 --> 00:18:17,100
pipeline is and rooting out the issues

556
00:18:17,100 --> 00:18:19,740
before it goes to production

557
00:18:19,740 --> 00:18:22,140
um so if you're if you're taking care of

558
00:18:22,140 --> 00:18:23,640
everything and staging and prod and

559
00:18:23,640 --> 00:18:25,620
you're fixing these dependencies then

560
00:18:25,620 --> 00:18:28,500
I'm sorry in staging

561
00:18:28,500 --> 00:18:30,059
um then you should have less emergency

562
00:18:30,059 --> 00:18:32,700
pushes and prod for vulnerability type

563
00:18:32,700 --> 00:18:34,380
things if you're you're doing everything

564
00:18:34,380 --> 00:18:36,419
right in your pipeline there should be

565
00:18:36,419 --> 00:18:37,820
less emergency

566
00:18:37,820 --> 00:18:40,980
we have to do a patch to prod because we

567
00:18:40,980 --> 00:18:42,179
didn't take care of it we didn't catch

568
00:18:42,179 --> 00:18:43,740
in staging a test

569
00:18:43,740 --> 00:18:45,240
um it happens after the fact sometimes

570
00:18:45,240 --> 00:18:46,919
we don't even know about our voted so

571
00:18:46,919 --> 00:18:49,380
it's in production log 4J and spring

572
00:18:49,380 --> 00:18:52,740
boot you know like that happens but that

573
00:18:52,740 --> 00:18:55,620
should be the exception not the rule

574
00:18:55,620 --> 00:18:57,480
thank you thank you so much one one

575
00:18:57,480 --> 00:18:59,640
