1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,399
thank you thank you bye

2
00:00:02,399 --> 00:00:05,279
so next one is

3
00:00:05,279 --> 00:00:08,639
hila hey yeah how are you I'm good how

4
00:00:08,639 --> 00:00:10,620
are you and Matt

5
00:00:10,620 --> 00:00:13,080
we're doing we're doing great I mean the

6
00:00:13,080 --> 00:00:15,000
hard work is done by you folks and we're

7
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:17,640
just have to be on stage and sometimes

8
00:00:17,640 --> 00:00:19,980
introduce some somebody and well try not

9
00:00:19,980 --> 00:00:21,779
to make it too long that's pretty much

10
00:00:21,779 --> 00:00:24,840
my thing so let me bring up your screen

11
00:00:24,840 --> 00:00:27,660
because I already have it and

12
00:00:27,660 --> 00:00:30,779
I would say um the floor is yours take

13
00:00:30,779 --> 00:00:34,320
it away thanks guys I'm gonna ice cream

14
00:00:34,320 --> 00:00:37,020
you know full screen okay awesome so

15
00:00:37,020 --> 00:00:39,000
first of all thank you so much uh for

16
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:41,340
joining this session and the second in

17
00:00:41,340 --> 00:00:42,480
general

18
00:00:42,480 --> 00:00:44,399
um and this talk will be about open

19
00:00:44,399 --> 00:00:46,320
source and open source is open choice

20
00:00:46,320 --> 00:00:48,780
right so in this talk I will give you a

21
00:00:48,780 --> 00:00:50,579
set of tools to help ease your decision

22
00:00:50,579 --> 00:00:52,620
about open source adoption when you

23
00:00:52,620 --> 00:00:54,719
should do it and practical tools that

24
00:00:54,719 --> 00:00:56,640
you can use to choose the right open

25
00:00:56,640 --> 00:00:59,399
source project for you so first of all

26
00:00:59,399 --> 00:01:01,980
hi my name is hila fish I'm a senior

27
00:01:01,980 --> 00:01:04,080
devops engineer and I work for weeks I

28
00:01:04,080 --> 00:01:05,760
have 15 years of experience in the tech

29
00:01:05,760 --> 00:01:08,280
industry recently I've joined the AWS

30
00:01:08,280 --> 00:01:10,260
Community Builders program I helped

31
00:01:10,260 --> 00:01:12,659
co-organize conferences in Israel where

32
00:01:12,659 --> 00:01:14,640
I live the hopes they still live and

33
00:01:14,640 --> 00:01:16,860
start craft monitoring conference

34
00:01:16,860 --> 00:01:18,979
I'm a mentoring courses and communities

35
00:01:18,979 --> 00:01:22,200
a great believer in the devops culture

36
00:01:22,200 --> 00:01:24,840
fan a devil's culture I'm a fan and I'm

37
00:01:24,840 --> 00:01:26,520
a lead singer in a cover band as you can

38
00:01:26,520 --> 00:01:29,220
see this picture it is a lot of fun

39
00:01:29,220 --> 00:01:31,860
okay so open source is publicly

40
00:01:31,860 --> 00:01:34,380
available right and you can modify it at

41
00:01:34,380 --> 00:01:37,079
12 of course don't just push to a main

42
00:01:37,079 --> 00:01:39,900
create a PR you know and the thing is

43
00:01:39,900 --> 00:01:42,360
that a lot of tools that we use in our

44
00:01:42,360 --> 00:01:45,960
day-to-day is open source so react Java

45
00:01:45,960 --> 00:01:48,479
Firefox Linux right all of these amazing

46
00:01:48,479 --> 00:01:50,280
tools are open source which is awesome

47
00:01:50,280 --> 00:01:51,240
to know

48
00:01:51,240 --> 00:01:54,180
so in the late 90s proprietary software

49
00:01:54,180 --> 00:01:56,040
was considered the standard and the

50
00:01:56,040 --> 00:01:57,960
notion of making a source code public

51
00:01:57,960 --> 00:02:00,600
was considered bad strategy for tech

52
00:02:00,600 --> 00:02:04,140
companies a coming forward into 2020 and

53
00:02:04,140 --> 00:02:06,240
up until now the concept of Open Source

54
00:02:06,240 --> 00:02:08,699
became mainstream so let's understand

55
00:02:08,699 --> 00:02:11,819
what's so good about open source so open

56
00:02:11,819 --> 00:02:14,400
source helps build a rich developer

57
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:16,560
Community because it's a society that is

58
00:02:16,560 --> 00:02:18,720
based on knowledge but really relies on

59
00:02:18,720 --> 00:02:20,879
the core values of communication and

60
00:02:20,879 --> 00:02:23,520
collaboration to succeed and open source

61
00:02:23,520 --> 00:02:25,440
also boosts our code quality and

62
00:02:25,440 --> 00:02:27,540
security because as Lionel stovat said

63
00:02:27,540 --> 00:02:30,720
is no one right is just the creator of

64
00:02:30,720 --> 00:02:33,180
Linux and git so this amazing person

65
00:02:33,180 --> 00:02:35,340
said that giving enough eyeballs all

66
00:02:35,340 --> 00:02:37,440
bags are shallow meaning that

67
00:02:37,440 --> 00:02:40,379
if we uh since the code is publicly

68
00:02:40,379 --> 00:02:42,780
available anyone can spot and collect

69
00:02:42,780 --> 00:02:45,000
any errors or missions and if we don't

70
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:47,459
only spot them but also fix them then

71
00:02:47,459 --> 00:02:49,860
the code will be in a high quality State

72
00:02:49,860 --> 00:02:52,080
and much more secure

73
00:02:52,080 --> 00:02:54,599
and open source also boosts objectivity

74
00:02:54,599 --> 00:02:57,120
because how the code is adaptive since

75
00:02:57,120 --> 00:02:59,400
we have more users then we have more use

76
00:02:59,400 --> 00:03:01,200
cases and then the code will be much

77
00:03:01,200 --> 00:03:04,019
more robust it also allows us surfacing

78
00:03:04,019 --> 00:03:06,180
bugs and edge cases much more rapidly

79
00:03:06,180 --> 00:03:09,239
than traditional QA processes and it

80
00:03:09,239 --> 00:03:12,120
also encourages more modularity avoiding

81
00:03:12,120 --> 00:03:14,459
the one size fits all kind of assumption

82
00:03:14,459 --> 00:03:16,980
resulting in a greater flexibility and

83
00:03:16,980 --> 00:03:18,720
lower customization costs in the long

84
00:03:18,720 --> 00:03:19,800
run

85
00:03:19,800 --> 00:03:22,019
also it helps with agility right because

86
00:03:22,019 --> 00:03:24,959
most of Open Source software follows

87
00:03:24,959 --> 00:03:27,180
modern software development processes

88
00:03:27,180 --> 00:03:30,180
which leads to Rapid development Cycles

89
00:03:30,180 --> 00:03:32,040
which leads to more frequent releases

90
00:03:32,040 --> 00:03:35,879
without sacrificing uh quality also

91
00:03:35,879 --> 00:03:37,500
um we have less bureaucracy right

92
00:03:37,500 --> 00:03:40,319
opening a support ticket for proprietary

93
00:03:40,319 --> 00:03:42,599
software as opposed to opening a PR

94
00:03:42,599 --> 00:03:45,239
totally two different things and we have

95
00:03:45,239 --> 00:03:47,340
no regularly scheduled release process

96
00:03:47,340 --> 00:03:49,319
like other companies will release only

97
00:03:49,319 --> 00:03:51,840
on Sundays do not harm the clients

98
00:03:51,840 --> 00:03:53,760
in open source they just released the

99
00:03:53,760 --> 00:03:55,860
versions you can use them whatever they

100
00:03:55,860 --> 00:03:59,159
want and that's it and I put a an

101
00:03:59,159 --> 00:04:00,959
interesting reads by Ben Balter who

102
00:04:00,959 --> 00:04:03,680
works for GitHub I quoted some stuff

103
00:04:03,680 --> 00:04:07,019
throughout until now from his uh article

104
00:04:07,019 --> 00:04:09,299
great article about open source adoption

105
00:04:09,299 --> 00:04:11,700
I really recommend you uh to edit and we

106
00:04:11,700 --> 00:04:13,680
will provide the link afterwards

107
00:04:13,680 --> 00:04:15,900
so let's cover the devops perspective

108
00:04:15,900 --> 00:04:17,399
because usually this is something that

109
00:04:17,399 --> 00:04:19,620
is more dealt from the developer side

110
00:04:19,620 --> 00:04:21,660
and not devops so I'm gonna share with

111
00:04:21,660 --> 00:04:23,460
you the devops perspective towards open

112
00:04:23,460 --> 00:04:25,919
source so in order to understand devops

113
00:04:25,919 --> 00:04:27,479
perspective let's understand the

114
00:04:27,479 --> 00:04:29,940
developers perspective so developers say

115
00:04:29,940 --> 00:04:32,580
hey we care about functionality

116
00:04:32,580 --> 00:04:36,300
and one we once we find a library that

117
00:04:36,300 --> 00:04:39,060
is open source we need to check how well

118
00:04:39,060 --> 00:04:41,460
it will get integrated in my code and

119
00:04:41,460 --> 00:04:43,080
what efforts are needed to do so maybe I

120
00:04:43,080 --> 00:04:44,400
need to do a factoring and stuff like

121
00:04:44,400 --> 00:04:46,740
that as opposed to that

122
00:04:46,740 --> 00:04:49,020
devops our main concern is the

123
00:04:49,020 --> 00:04:51,060
environment so once we find the project

124
00:04:51,060 --> 00:04:54,240
that we want to integrate we say okay

125
00:04:54,240 --> 00:04:56,520
how well will it get integrated in the

126
00:04:56,520 --> 00:04:58,500
environment and we have other peripheral

127
00:04:58,500 --> 00:05:00,240
things to consider like security

128
00:05:00,240 --> 00:05:01,800
maintenance

129
00:05:01,800 --> 00:05:03,180
Etc

130
00:05:03,180 --> 00:05:06,300
also a common ground between devops and

131
00:05:06,300 --> 00:05:08,820
open source is collaboration and as it

132
00:05:08,820 --> 00:05:10,919
says here on the screen when it comes to

133
00:05:10,919 --> 00:05:12,960
challenges collaboration leads to better

134
00:05:12,960 --> 00:05:15,360
conclusions and solutions because when

135
00:05:15,360 --> 00:05:18,419
communities form around challenges the

136
00:05:18,419 --> 00:05:20,100
diversity of ideas that naturally

137
00:05:20,100 --> 00:05:22,860
emerges surfaces better Solutions and we

138
00:05:22,860 --> 00:05:24,960
all want better Solutions because I care

139
00:05:24,960 --> 00:05:26,400
about the environment right and we want

140
00:05:26,400 --> 00:05:28,380
to make sure we introduce the best

141
00:05:28,380 --> 00:05:30,000
implementation and best solution

142
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:32,520
possible for the environment

143
00:05:32,520 --> 00:05:34,860
we also treat open source as tools and

144
00:05:34,860 --> 00:05:36,840
we ask ourselves do we want to introduce

145
00:05:36,840 --> 00:05:38,699
this and that to the system things that

146
00:05:38,699 --> 00:05:40,860
will help us deliver code or automate

147
00:05:40,860 --> 00:05:43,680
this or introduce this capability and we

148
00:05:43,680 --> 00:05:45,180
can really be flexible with what we

149
00:05:45,180 --> 00:05:46,860
introduced to our system sense

150
00:05:46,860 --> 00:05:49,139
integration is no strange concept for us

151
00:05:49,139 --> 00:05:51,060
because a lot of devops Engineers came

152
00:05:51,060 --> 00:05:52,979
from the system engineering background

153
00:05:52,979 --> 00:05:55,380
so we did a lot of Integrations back

154
00:05:55,380 --> 00:05:57,780
then so we just treat it as another tool

155
00:05:57,780 --> 00:06:00,180
for our tool chain and that's basically

156
00:06:00,180 --> 00:06:01,560
it

157
00:06:01,560 --> 00:06:03,600
of course not everything is good right

158
00:06:03,600 --> 00:06:05,880
we need to understand that there are

159
00:06:05,880 --> 00:06:08,280
trade-offs that needs to be considered

160
00:06:08,280 --> 00:06:10,020
because we need to care about the

161
00:06:10,020 --> 00:06:11,880
environment stability so we are in a

162
00:06:11,880 --> 00:06:13,199
constant state of trade-offs and

163
00:06:13,199 --> 00:06:15,660
maintaining balance between okay we have

164
00:06:15,660 --> 00:06:18,900
a tool and the tool got a new release

165
00:06:18,900 --> 00:06:22,080
but maybe the the version itself is not

166
00:06:22,080 --> 00:06:24,180
that great for me at the moment because

167
00:06:24,180 --> 00:06:25,919
the features are not really worthwhile

168
00:06:25,919 --> 00:06:28,319
or there's still a big bug that I can't

169
00:06:28,319 --> 00:06:29,100
really

170
00:06:29,100 --> 00:06:31,139
afford introducing to the environment

171
00:06:31,139 --> 00:06:34,080
and we basically we don't want to walk

172
00:06:34,080 --> 00:06:36,660
the boat too much also there's a lot of

173
00:06:36,660 --> 00:06:39,620
variety of projects out there a lot of

174
00:06:39,620 --> 00:06:42,060
things to consider a lot of dependencies

175
00:06:42,060 --> 00:06:44,520
right a lot of complexities like take

176
00:06:44,520 --> 00:06:46,440
for example Jenkins show me one person

177
00:06:46,440 --> 00:06:49,080
that is able to upgrade rankings or its

178
00:06:49,080 --> 00:06:50,880
plugins without having any feel that

179
00:06:50,880 --> 00:06:54,240
nothing or something will break right so

180
00:06:54,240 --> 00:06:56,759
we always need to think about what we do

181
00:06:56,759 --> 00:06:59,280
and without rocking the boat too much

182
00:06:59,280 --> 00:07:01,620
because our focus is the environment

183
00:07:01,620 --> 00:07:03,000
stability and in the middle of

184
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:05,580
everything once we get to learn about a

185
00:07:05,580 --> 00:07:07,620
certain tool we need to do some research

186
00:07:07,620 --> 00:07:09,660
because we need to make sure we know

187
00:07:09,660 --> 00:07:11,940
exactly what we introduced to our

188
00:07:11,940 --> 00:07:13,500
environment

189
00:07:13,500 --> 00:07:15,720
another thing this is a generally

190
00:07:15,720 --> 00:07:18,539
speaking for a devops but also for open

191
00:07:18,539 --> 00:07:21,000
source we need to be to keep tabs and be

192
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:22,560
informed of what's going on because I

193
00:07:22,560 --> 00:07:23,940
really like this picture because if you

194
00:07:23,940 --> 00:07:26,220
you will closely look it says keep

195
00:07:26,220 --> 00:07:28,440
moving people even though nobody's there

196
00:07:28,440 --> 00:07:30,960
that's exactly it we need to keep tabs

197
00:07:30,960 --> 00:07:33,360
and people active and learn about things

198
00:07:33,360 --> 00:07:35,400
on our own without having our team

199
00:07:35,400 --> 00:07:37,199
leader breathing down our neck and

200
00:07:37,199 --> 00:07:39,060
saying hey please check this and that

201
00:07:39,060 --> 00:07:41,520
this will make us a better engineers in

202
00:07:41,520 --> 00:07:43,440
my opinion and I will give you an

203
00:07:43,440 --> 00:07:45,840
example for that from the open source

204
00:07:45,840 --> 00:07:48,720
perspective so let's say we found a tool

205
00:07:48,720 --> 00:07:51,539
version 1.0 it's okay but it doesn't

206
00:07:51,539 --> 00:07:54,479
really fit our use cases or there is a

207
00:07:54,479 --> 00:07:56,699
big bug that I can't introduce to the

208
00:07:56,699 --> 00:07:59,580
environment yet it's not worth a while

209
00:07:59,580 --> 00:08:02,280
yet so maybe I can keep the apps follow

210
00:08:02,280 --> 00:08:04,979
this project and watch it in GitHub and

211
00:08:04,979 --> 00:08:08,520
then version 2.0 will be exactly what I

212
00:08:08,520 --> 00:08:11,039
need features are great so this for my

213
00:08:11,039 --> 00:08:13,500
use case the bug was fixed all good so

214
00:08:13,500 --> 00:08:15,419
this is one example another example is

215
00:08:15,419 --> 00:08:17,400
that if you take for example

216
00:08:17,400 --> 00:08:19,620
and sent to us the the operating system

217
00:08:19,620 --> 00:08:21,780
it reached end of life at the end of

218
00:08:21,780 --> 00:08:25,020
2021. for those who who don't know end

219
00:08:25,020 --> 00:08:27,120
of life means no more security patches

220
00:08:27,120 --> 00:08:29,759
getting released to uh to that operating

221
00:08:29,759 --> 00:08:32,399
system and then it puts my systems at

222
00:08:32,399 --> 00:08:35,159
risk so if I didn't know about that if I

223
00:08:35,159 --> 00:08:37,559
didn't read and check what's going on

224
00:08:37,559 --> 00:08:40,140
then I wouldn't be able to support my

225
00:08:40,140 --> 00:08:41,820
systems in the best way possible and

226
00:08:41,820 --> 00:08:44,039
even putting them at risk because of

227
00:08:44,039 --> 00:08:44,820
that

228
00:08:44,820 --> 00:08:47,459
so being keep keeping tabs and being

229
00:08:47,459 --> 00:08:50,100
informed of what's going on is very very

230
00:08:50,100 --> 00:08:51,180
important

231
00:08:51,180 --> 00:08:52,920
so let's understand when should we

232
00:08:52,920 --> 00:08:55,140
consider open source so when we have an

233
00:08:55,140 --> 00:08:58,740
uncommon use case like um for example uh

234
00:08:58,740 --> 00:09:01,019
in my previous company we had a need to

235
00:09:01,019 --> 00:09:03,600
decrease uh pods in kubernetes to zero

236
00:09:03,600 --> 00:09:06,720
and not one and we use the gke at that

237
00:09:06,720 --> 00:09:09,180
time I think it still doesn't support

238
00:09:09,180 --> 00:09:11,760
that we use Keda Keda is an awesome open

239
00:09:11,760 --> 00:09:14,399
source tool that allows us to do that

240
00:09:14,399 --> 00:09:16,620
uncommon use case solved by an open

241
00:09:16,620 --> 00:09:18,480
source that's great

242
00:09:18,480 --> 00:09:21,240
another reason when you have limited

243
00:09:21,240 --> 00:09:23,339
budget right so and you can't really

244
00:09:23,339 --> 00:09:25,019
afford purchasing an Enterprise license

245
00:09:25,019 --> 00:09:27,180
of the software then you can use its

246
00:09:27,180 --> 00:09:29,519
free version or open source

247
00:09:29,519 --> 00:09:32,040
also insufficient in-house resources

248
00:09:32,040 --> 00:09:34,440
ability wise like this family guy right

249
00:09:34,440 --> 00:09:36,660
here all capacity wise to create

250
00:09:36,660 --> 00:09:38,519
solution of your own and and you know

251
00:09:38,519 --> 00:09:40,500
why they invent the wheel there's a

252
00:09:40,500 --> 00:09:42,720
saying like that so if there's already a

253
00:09:42,720 --> 00:09:44,220
solution out there that fits your knees

254
00:09:44,220 --> 00:09:46,440
your needs just use that

255
00:09:46,440 --> 00:09:48,420
we can discuss the good without

256
00:09:48,420 --> 00:09:50,399
discussing the bad uh so let's

257
00:09:50,399 --> 00:09:52,560
understand some of the disadvantages of

258
00:09:52,560 --> 00:09:55,080
adopting open source

259
00:09:55,080 --> 00:09:57,180
first of all Security Box security

260
00:09:57,180 --> 00:09:59,420
and doesn't apply on open source because

261
00:09:59,420 --> 00:10:01,680
proprietary software companies can claim

262
00:10:01,680 --> 00:10:03,899
that the code is much more secure than

263
00:10:03,899 --> 00:10:05,760
open source Alternatives because of that

264
00:10:05,760 --> 00:10:09,060
because hackers can check the code and

265
00:10:09,060 --> 00:10:13,019
spot any loopholes and security breaches

266
00:10:13,019 --> 00:10:15,000
we need to to understand that open

267
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:17,820
source does uh have a tendency to to be

268
00:10:17,820 --> 00:10:19,560
prone to abuse because I can give you

269
00:10:19,560 --> 00:10:23,160
two example uh two examples for that a

270
00:10:23,160 --> 00:10:24,959
Carlos npm package where the maintainer

271
00:10:24,959 --> 00:10:26,459
added the loop and created a lot of

272
00:10:26,459 --> 00:10:28,380
issues for a lot of companies and fake

273
00:10:28,380 --> 00:10:30,480
your JS which the maintenance if I'm not

274
00:10:30,480 --> 00:10:33,000
mistaken had a bankruptcy and that just

275
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:34,560
the next version he released was to

276
00:10:34,560 --> 00:10:37,980
delete the project in its entirety so

277
00:10:37,980 --> 00:10:40,740
you can say but yeah I can put a version

278
00:10:40,740 --> 00:10:42,060
in um

279
00:10:42,060 --> 00:10:45,000
in requirements txt or package a log

280
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:47,820
Json and that's it but yeah but if

281
00:10:47,820 --> 00:10:50,040
anyone could have done that then we

282
00:10:50,040 --> 00:10:52,500
wouldn't even be hearing about all of

283
00:10:52,500 --> 00:10:55,620
these uh special cases so we need to

284
00:10:55,620 --> 00:10:57,300
understand that it is born to abuse and

285
00:10:57,300 --> 00:10:59,459
we need to uh be aware of that

286
00:10:59,459 --> 00:11:01,980
compliance so it's wrong from open

287
00:11:01,980 --> 00:11:04,140
source usually gives no warranty or

288
00:11:04,140 --> 00:11:05,880
official guarantee making it difficult

289
00:11:05,880 --> 00:11:07,800
to use in a business environment where

290
00:11:07,800 --> 00:11:11,240
compliance is a must

291
00:11:11,640 --> 00:11:13,620
open source is not always free we need

292
00:11:13,620 --> 00:11:15,300
to learn that we need to check the

293
00:11:15,300 --> 00:11:16,980
licenses very carefully especially if

294
00:11:16,980 --> 00:11:18,839
the reason for choosing open source is

295
00:11:18,839 --> 00:11:22,399
because of uh you have a limited budget

296
00:11:22,399 --> 00:11:24,540
discontinued projects not all open

297
00:11:24,540 --> 00:11:26,160
source projects are backed up by

298
00:11:26,160 --> 00:11:28,500
companies some maintained by people like

299
00:11:28,500 --> 00:11:31,500
me and you and they are totally in the

300
00:11:31,500 --> 00:11:33,899
right to say hey I'm not supporting this

301
00:11:33,899 --> 00:11:36,899
project anymore it's okay so if this

302
00:11:36,899 --> 00:11:39,240
happens and you adopted a tool like that

303
00:11:39,240 --> 00:11:42,120
it means that you either need to do a

304
00:11:42,120 --> 00:11:43,440
migration to another tool or another

305
00:11:43,440 --> 00:11:46,380
solution or you'll be the maintenance

306
00:11:46,380 --> 00:11:47,880
from now on

307
00:11:47,880 --> 00:11:50,100
support is not guaranteed so you need to

308
00:11:50,100 --> 00:11:52,500
assume good faith when you deal with

309
00:11:52,500 --> 00:11:54,660
open source I open the issues to get

310
00:11:54,660 --> 00:11:58,019
Keda in very out of business hours and

311
00:11:58,019 --> 00:12:00,360
they will very very helpful so you need

312
00:12:00,360 --> 00:12:03,000
to assume good faith but

313
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:04,860
and if you do and if you expand a

314
00:12:04,860 --> 00:12:07,500
situation very nicely they should be

315
00:12:07,500 --> 00:12:09,839
able to help help because collaboration

316
00:12:09,839 --> 00:12:11,519
is a common ground

317
00:12:11,519 --> 00:12:13,860
and such Alternatives it's not really

318
00:12:13,860 --> 00:12:16,560
the opposite of Open Source and but

319
00:12:16,560 --> 00:12:19,500
since a lot of companies shift more and

320
00:12:19,500 --> 00:12:21,839
more resources to the cloud we might see

321
00:12:21,839 --> 00:12:25,680
more uh managed Services adoption rather

322
00:12:25,680 --> 00:12:27,540
than open source because they prefer to

323
00:12:27,540 --> 00:12:32,279
to shift the the set of things from a

324
00:12:32,279 --> 00:12:34,200
dependency on devops teams as opposed to

325
00:12:34,200 --> 00:12:37,620
being a cloud lock scenario so we need

326
00:12:37,620 --> 00:12:39,360
to also think about that

327
00:12:39,360 --> 00:12:41,820
so uh to some things happen regard to

328
00:12:41,820 --> 00:12:43,620
adopting open source they really don't

329
00:12:43,620 --> 00:12:45,060
know right or wrong it's a matter of

330
00:12:45,060 --> 00:12:46,740
perspective and there are multiple

331
00:12:46,740 --> 00:12:48,540
factors to consider and we should use

332
00:12:48,540 --> 00:12:50,519
and and we should choose what's best for

333
00:12:50,519 --> 00:12:53,100
our needs and speaking of our needs how

334
00:12:53,100 --> 00:12:54,899
do we choose an open source project so

335
00:12:54,899 --> 00:12:56,820
there are a lot of questions that I have

336
00:12:56,820 --> 00:12:58,980
here listed I don't have much time so

337
00:12:58,980 --> 00:13:01,560
I'm gonna speed right into it uh so

338
00:13:01,560 --> 00:13:04,260
popularity check GitHub Styles check if

339
00:13:04,260 --> 00:13:06,839
the product is part of cncf or incubator

340
00:13:06,839 --> 00:13:09,060
because if so it's a good um

341
00:13:09,060 --> 00:13:12,540
stamp that it has it is in a high

342
00:13:12,540 --> 00:13:14,760
quality state in high standards Google

343
00:13:14,760 --> 00:13:16,320
the project alone to check for online

344
00:13:16,320 --> 00:13:18,360
presence but also also Google it versus

345
00:13:18,360 --> 00:13:20,279
similar products to check for reviews

346
00:13:20,279 --> 00:13:22,620
and maybe staff will rise there that is

347
00:13:22,620 --> 00:13:25,139
not in the documentation activity check

348
00:13:25,139 --> 00:13:27,120
the commit suite are they daily weekly

349
00:13:27,120 --> 00:13:29,040
monthly how many issues are there how

350
00:13:29,040 --> 00:13:30,660
many releases are there is the project

351
00:13:30,660 --> 00:13:33,120
maintained by one developer or more does

352
00:13:33,120 --> 00:13:35,100
the project have sponsors all of these

353
00:13:35,100 --> 00:13:36,120
questions are meant for you to

354
00:13:36,120 --> 00:13:38,399
understand that if you need uh like

355
00:13:38,399 --> 00:13:41,579
day-to-day maintenance or or somewhat a

356
00:13:41,579 --> 00:13:43,860
day-to-day if you need bug fixes

357
00:13:43,860 --> 00:13:46,260
organizers how long should you wait for

358
00:13:46,260 --> 00:13:47,639
them to come out

359
00:13:47,639 --> 00:13:49,500
security you need to check for

360
00:13:49,500 --> 00:13:51,300
non-vulnerabilities and supply chain

361
00:13:51,300 --> 00:13:54,240
considerations it's less something that

362
00:13:54,240 --> 00:13:56,940
is a visible in in the devops realm

363
00:13:56,940 --> 00:13:59,100
because usually we use projects and not

364
00:13:59,100 --> 00:14:01,620
uh libraries that we incorporate in code

365
00:14:01,620 --> 00:14:03,720
but still security is always something

366
00:14:03,720 --> 00:14:06,060
that we need to consider so always have

367
00:14:06,060 --> 00:14:07,260
that in mind

368
00:14:07,260 --> 00:14:09,120
Readiness is the product declared as

369
00:14:09,120 --> 00:14:11,160
production ready cater the the tool that

370
00:14:11,160 --> 00:14:12,660
I mentioned is what action ready which

371
00:14:12,660 --> 00:14:13,980
is awesome for me as the production

372
00:14:13,980 --> 00:14:15,300
GateKeeper

373
00:14:15,300 --> 00:14:17,160
are the current features enough to

374
00:14:17,160 --> 00:14:20,339
sustain usage and is my use case covered

375
00:14:20,339 --> 00:14:22,380
fully in the current state and if not am

376
00:14:22,380 --> 00:14:24,480
I okay with it because if not maybe I

377
00:14:24,480 --> 00:14:26,459
should keep tabs and check the version

378
00:14:26,459 --> 00:14:28,519
the next version that will come out

379
00:14:28,519 --> 00:14:30,899
documentation so documentation is

380
00:14:30,899 --> 00:14:33,060
probably the gateway to the project and

381
00:14:33,060 --> 00:14:35,220
this is how we learn things about the

382
00:14:35,220 --> 00:14:37,380
project so if the documentation is Rich

383
00:14:37,380 --> 00:14:40,620
and couples most aspects like how to how

384
00:14:40,620 --> 00:14:43,079
to integrate known issues explanations

385
00:14:43,079 --> 00:14:45,360
about features Etc then it really really

386
00:14:45,360 --> 00:14:47,760
help us understand both how to integrate

387
00:14:47,760 --> 00:14:49,860
but also understand if this product is

388
00:14:49,860 --> 00:14:52,620
what we actually need if it fits our use

389
00:14:52,620 --> 00:14:53,639
case

390
00:14:53,639 --> 00:14:55,440
ecosystem I think this is the most

391
00:14:55,440 --> 00:14:57,959
important metric out there because I

392
00:14:57,959 --> 00:14:59,579
will give you an example in one of my

393
00:14:59,579 --> 00:15:01,920
previous companies I used a randec for

394
00:15:01,920 --> 00:15:04,079
the CI tool at that time the computation

395
00:15:04,079 --> 00:15:05,760
wasn't great and the ecosystem was very

396
00:15:05,760 --> 00:15:08,699
very small so it was very hard to to

397
00:15:08,699 --> 00:15:11,040
learn how to do things as opposed to

398
00:15:11,040 --> 00:15:13,380
that in other company I use Jenkins you

399
00:15:13,380 --> 00:15:14,760
can say a lot of things about Jenkins

400
00:15:14,760 --> 00:15:18,420
but the ecosystem is very very large and

401
00:15:18,420 --> 00:15:20,220
it's not only the fact that people can

402
00:15:20,220 --> 00:15:22,620
help you if you reach out to them it's

403
00:15:22,620 --> 00:15:24,060
the fact that you know if you know that

404
00:15:24,060 --> 00:15:25,740
a lot of people are using it probably

405
00:15:25,740 --> 00:15:28,139
it's suitable for a lot of use cases so

406
00:15:28,139 --> 00:15:30,060
ecosystem is the metric that will help

407
00:15:30,060 --> 00:15:32,279
you in your day-to-day making it much

408
00:15:32,279 --> 00:15:34,800
more easier to maintain rather than uh

409
00:15:34,800 --> 00:15:36,240
rather than not

410
00:15:36,240 --> 00:15:39,180
ease of use up your C see how well it

411
00:15:39,180 --> 00:15:40,740
gets integrated in your environment and

412
00:15:40,740 --> 00:15:42,839
check the issues on it on GitHub are the

413
00:15:42,839 --> 00:15:44,519
issues about features or about how do I

414
00:15:44,519 --> 00:15:46,260
do X because if the issue is about how

415
00:15:46,260 --> 00:15:48,240
do I do X probably it's not that easy to

416
00:15:48,240 --> 00:15:48,899
use

417
00:15:48,899 --> 00:15:51,959
and check roadmap so if the product is

418
00:15:51,959 --> 00:15:53,880
planned to stay open source or be

419
00:15:53,880 --> 00:15:55,980
monetized and also features planning if

420
00:15:55,980 --> 00:15:58,380
they think about the features a plan and

421
00:15:58,380 --> 00:16:00,480
plan ahead then you know build a future

422
00:16:00,480 --> 00:16:01,800
to that project

423
00:16:01,800 --> 00:16:04,260
so in to sum things up how to choose an

424
00:16:04,260 --> 00:16:05,940
open source project ask the general

425
00:16:05,940 --> 00:16:07,860
questions to cover the basics if to

426
00:16:07,860 --> 00:16:09,300
check if the product is in a very enough

427
00:16:09,300 --> 00:16:11,820
State and ask detailed specific

428
00:16:11,820 --> 00:16:13,680
questions to cover your use case and

429
00:16:13,680 --> 00:16:16,139
pain points so if for example you don't

430
00:16:16,139 --> 00:16:18,480
you have a heavy use case put more

431
00:16:18,480 --> 00:16:19,980
weight on the documentation and

432
00:16:19,980 --> 00:16:21,959
ecosystem metrics if and if you don't

433
00:16:21,959 --> 00:16:23,519
have capacity form of air maintenance

434
00:16:23,519 --> 00:16:27,120
then put the emphasis on Readiness and

435
00:16:27,120 --> 00:16:30,720
ease of use metrics do a POC and rely on

436
00:16:30,720 --> 00:16:32,519
your research ecosystem to the rescue

437
00:16:32,519 --> 00:16:35,399
and also engage in GitHub open issues

438
00:16:35,399 --> 00:16:37,800
and contribute to the project success

439
00:16:37,800 --> 00:16:39,660
and usually I have another slide of how

440
00:16:39,660 --> 00:16:42,000
to contribute open source without

441
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:44,100
writing a single line of code because

442
00:16:44,100 --> 00:16:45,720
you don't have the time to do it or you

443
00:16:45,720 --> 00:16:47,880
don't have the ability to do it but I'm

444
00:16:47,880 --> 00:16:51,420
already over time so I'll just leave you

445
00:16:51,420 --> 00:16:53,339
to it and read this and if you have any

446
00:16:53,339 --> 00:16:55,139
more questions I'm here

447
00:16:55,139 --> 00:16:57,660
thank you so much

448
00:16:57,660 --> 00:17:01,500
thank you thank you that's great we're

449
00:17:01,500 --> 00:17:03,919
massive fans of Open Source here so

450
00:17:03,919 --> 00:17:08,520
preaching to the converted absolutely

451
00:17:08,520 --> 00:17:10,980
I just wanted to call up one comment in

452
00:17:10,980 --> 00:17:13,140
the chat that you were talking about the

453
00:17:13,140 --> 00:17:15,299
downsides of Open Source and most of

454
00:17:15,299 --> 00:17:16,859
these or some of these things are might

455
00:17:16,859 --> 00:17:18,839
also be applicable to proprietary

456
00:17:18,839 --> 00:17:21,260
software

457
00:17:21,740 --> 00:17:24,419
I mean depends on what for example the

458
00:17:24,419 --> 00:17:27,000
the in terms of support for example they

459
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:28,919
do have guaranteed support I usually

460
00:17:28,919 --> 00:17:31,440
when I have more time I say and kids

461
00:17:31,440 --> 00:17:33,840
that maybe the support is guaranteed but

462
00:17:33,840 --> 00:17:35,220
it doesn't it's not guaranteed to be

463
00:17:35,220 --> 00:17:35,940
good

464
00:17:35,940 --> 00:17:40,200
so um absolutely oh yeah yeah 100 they

465
00:17:40,200 --> 00:17:43,200
do have a support which is guaranteed so

466
00:17:43,200 --> 00:17:45,419
it really depends on which level and

467
00:17:45,419 --> 00:17:47,240
sometimes it will be much more

468
00:17:47,240 --> 00:17:50,100
easier or at least official on the

469
00:17:50,100 --> 00:17:52,320
proprietor software as opposed to open

470
00:17:52,320 --> 00:17:54,179
source where everything you need to see

471
00:17:54,179 --> 00:17:56,580
in good faith and just uh hope that

472
00:17:56,580 --> 00:17:59,100
everything will sort out yeah

473
00:17:59,100 --> 00:18:00,419
yeah absolutely

474
00:18:00,419 --> 00:18:02,039
um one thing you can do is is also

475
00:18:02,039 --> 00:18:03,660
commit to the open source project you

476
00:18:03,660 --> 00:18:05,640
are you are using so that might help

477
00:18:05,640 --> 00:18:07,080
your actually solve your problem

478
00:18:07,080 --> 00:18:09,120
yourself thank you so much if you have

479
