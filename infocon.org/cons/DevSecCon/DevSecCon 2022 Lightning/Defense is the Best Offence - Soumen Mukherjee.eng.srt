1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,680
from Simon mckergie who has been he's a

2
00:00:04,680 --> 00:00:06,420
software architect and he's got on more

3
00:00:06,420 --> 00:00:08,099
than 19 years of experience under his

4
00:00:08,099 --> 00:00:10,440
belt mostly in product and application

5
00:00:10,440 --> 00:00:11,940
security

6
00:00:11,940 --> 00:00:13,799
um done a lot of work in cloud-based

7
00:00:13,799 --> 00:00:16,139
Security Solutions SAS application and

8
00:00:16,139 --> 00:00:18,240
other Cloud platforms and today he's

9
00:00:18,240 --> 00:00:20,160
going to be talking to us about defense

10
00:00:20,160 --> 00:00:23,400
being the best offense I love that uh

11
00:00:23,400 --> 00:00:26,039
title so welcome on board Simon and

12
00:00:26,039 --> 00:00:27,660
thank you for joining us on devsecond

13
00:00:27,660 --> 00:00:29,640
we're looking forward to your talk

14
00:00:29,640 --> 00:00:32,279
yeah thank you shilpi and thank you

15
00:00:32,279 --> 00:00:34,920
Brahma uh wonderful to be part of this

16
00:00:34,920 --> 00:00:38,340
event and you know great people shilpi

17
00:00:38,340 --> 00:00:40,559
and is in particular you know you are a

18
00:00:40,559 --> 00:00:43,079
rock star you know by all means I didn't

19
00:00:43,079 --> 00:00:44,540
pay you for this

20
00:00:44,540 --> 00:00:46,739
I'm just gonna put a disclaimer out

21
00:00:46,739 --> 00:00:49,760
there but no thank you very much

22
00:00:50,420 --> 00:00:54,120
I'm ready for my talk uh amazing I will

23
00:00:54,120 --> 00:00:56,280
add your slide deck to the thing and a

24
00:00:56,280 --> 00:00:58,440
promo and I will just go away in the

25
00:00:58,440 --> 00:00:59,699
background and we're looking forward to

26
00:00:59,699 --> 00:01:04,199
this sure sure okay great so yeah so

27
00:01:04,199 --> 00:01:06,479
defense is the best offense obviously

28
00:01:06,479 --> 00:01:08,520
it's it's soccer time so you know it

29
00:01:08,520 --> 00:01:10,680
generally this is a term which is used

30
00:01:10,680 --> 00:01:13,320
many uh very uh

31
00:01:13,320 --> 00:01:16,619
uh widely in soccer and in other games

32
00:01:16,619 --> 00:01:20,159
like uh like Cricket hockey if I say you

33
00:01:20,159 --> 00:01:22,040
know attack is the best difference but

34
00:01:22,040 --> 00:01:25,680
this is just an uh you know uh

35
00:01:25,680 --> 00:01:29,220
kind of a oxymoron in in that sense but

36
00:01:29,220 --> 00:01:31,500
yes in today's context when we talk

37
00:01:31,500 --> 00:01:33,960
about product Security application

38
00:01:33,960 --> 00:01:38,040
security yeah a lot of uh focus goes

39
00:01:38,040 --> 00:01:42,060
into uh red teaming pen testing you know

40
00:01:42,060 --> 00:01:45,240
and basically trying to make sure uh

41
00:01:45,240 --> 00:01:48,119
that the controls are working but what

42
00:01:48,119 --> 00:01:49,200
about

43
00:01:49,200 --> 00:01:51,899
uh the fact that you actually have to go

44
00:01:51,899 --> 00:01:54,840
out and build those controls and uh

45
00:01:54,840 --> 00:01:57,720
there is there is obviously some good

46
00:01:57,720 --> 00:01:59,880
things that you can follow so this my

47
00:01:59,880 --> 00:02:01,799
lightning talk is actually going to

48
00:02:01,799 --> 00:02:05,759
focus on this approach where you

49
00:02:05,759 --> 00:02:09,538
focus on your defensive Security in your

50
00:02:09,538 --> 00:02:11,099
product in your solution

51
00:02:11,099 --> 00:02:13,860
so that's that's what it is going to be

52
00:02:13,860 --> 00:02:16,319
and with that I would you know move

53
00:02:16,319 --> 00:02:17,400
forward

54
00:02:17,400 --> 00:02:20,340
so what is defensive product security I

55
00:02:20,340 --> 00:02:22,860
think it is important to understand uh

56
00:02:22,860 --> 00:02:24,720
what you really mean and what you really

57
00:02:24,720 --> 00:02:28,080
want to do in terms of Defense so yeah

58
00:02:28,080 --> 00:02:30,480
if you look at the literal definition so

59
00:02:30,480 --> 00:02:32,640
it is basically it says okay you build

60
00:02:32,640 --> 00:02:34,860
you do defense in depth you have

61
00:02:34,860 --> 00:02:37,379
multiple layers of security and they are

62
00:02:37,379 --> 00:02:41,700
put out throughout the system uh and the

63
00:02:41,700 --> 00:02:44,160
objective of having multiple layers of

64
00:02:44,160 --> 00:02:46,500
Security is to provide redundancy so in

65
00:02:46,500 --> 00:02:49,019
the case in case one control is breached

66
00:02:49,019 --> 00:02:51,360
there is another control which is there

67
00:02:51,360 --> 00:02:54,599
to take care of of you know of your data

68
00:02:54,599 --> 00:02:56,760
of your confidentiality or of the

69
00:02:56,760 --> 00:02:58,500
availability of the system

70
00:02:58,500 --> 00:02:59,700
so

71
00:02:59,700 --> 00:03:02,459
now what are the approaches that you can

72
00:03:02,459 --> 00:03:05,519
take so you know this is fine as a

73
00:03:05,519 --> 00:03:09,379
concept but uh I think three important

74
00:03:09,379 --> 00:03:13,739
uh steps uh which are you know kind of

75
00:03:13,739 --> 00:03:15,420
pillars to the defensive product

76
00:03:15,420 --> 00:03:16,680
security is

77
00:03:16,680 --> 00:03:19,980
security requirements identification uh

78
00:03:19,980 --> 00:03:22,080
design security and secure development

79
00:03:22,080 --> 00:03:23,879
practices I think these are the three

80
00:03:23,879 --> 00:03:26,159
key elements and moving forward I'm

81
00:03:26,159 --> 00:03:27,980
going to talk a little bit more about

82
00:03:27,980 --> 00:03:31,140
these aspects

83
00:03:31,140 --> 00:03:34,200
so one thing which is very important to

84
00:03:34,200 --> 00:03:36,840
understand and that kind of people tend

85
00:03:36,840 --> 00:03:40,680
to ignore is uh identification of what

86
00:03:40,680 --> 00:03:42,780
to secure you know we have an

87
00:03:42,780 --> 00:03:45,239
application we might have a perimeter

88
00:03:45,239 --> 00:03:48,299
fine but you will have lot of

89
00:03:48,299 --> 00:03:50,220
information Assets in the system

90
00:03:50,220 --> 00:03:52,920
information assets could be database

91
00:03:52,920 --> 00:03:55,200
could be configuration values could be

92
00:03:55,200 --> 00:03:58,500
endpoints uh it could be anything which

93
00:03:58,500 --> 00:03:59,700
is

94
00:03:59,700 --> 00:04:02,580
you know at the boundary or providing

95
00:04:02,580 --> 00:04:06,780
some kind of status uh so identification

96
00:04:06,780 --> 00:04:08,879
of the critical information asset of the

97
00:04:08,879 --> 00:04:12,060
system is I think very important

98
00:04:12,060 --> 00:04:14,939
another important thing is the

99
00:04:14,939 --> 00:04:17,339
identification of the Doomsday scenario

100
00:04:17,339 --> 00:04:20,339
which basically means okay what is the

101
00:04:20,339 --> 00:04:23,220
condition that is going to cause the the

102
00:04:23,220 --> 00:04:26,220
most business impact okay is it a system

103
00:04:26,220 --> 00:04:28,320
going down or is it getting you know the

104
00:04:28,320 --> 00:04:32,340
system uh the data breach so exactly you

105
00:04:32,340 --> 00:04:34,560
know you have to look at your system

106
00:04:34,560 --> 00:04:37,080
from the business angle and identify the

107
00:04:37,080 --> 00:04:40,500
Doomsday scenario uh not everything is

108
00:04:40,500 --> 00:04:43,919
like super critical or super risky but

109
00:04:43,919 --> 00:04:46,740
yes uh definitely there are certain

110
00:04:46,740 --> 00:04:50,460
things which are uh really uh you know

111
00:04:50,460 --> 00:04:52,500
there will always be on the top of the

112
00:04:52,500 --> 00:04:56,660
list so you have to identify those

113
00:04:57,660 --> 00:05:00,600
then uh we talk about security

114
00:05:00,600 --> 00:05:02,759
baselining again a very important

115
00:05:02,759 --> 00:05:07,139
concept not many are you know do this in

116
00:05:07,139 --> 00:05:09,600
in my view they kind of try to jump this

117
00:05:09,600 --> 00:05:11,340
step and say okay

118
00:05:11,340 --> 00:05:15,000
we will build it uh ground up but

119
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:17,460
there is definitely a lot of Advantage

120
00:05:17,460 --> 00:05:20,639
if you uh follow this a structured

121
00:05:20,639 --> 00:05:22,680
approach where you say that okay I will

122
00:05:22,680 --> 00:05:25,860
have a minimum set of security controls

123
00:05:25,860 --> 00:05:30,180
defined for my system and uh you know

124
00:05:30,180 --> 00:05:33,060
again this the minimum set is different

125
00:05:33,060 --> 00:05:35,880
for from system to system so you might

126
00:05:35,880 --> 00:05:38,100
have a different set of minimal uh

127
00:05:38,100 --> 00:05:41,520
controls for uh let's say uh uh you know

128
00:05:41,520 --> 00:05:44,880
uh restaurant booking solution versus if

129
00:05:44,880 --> 00:05:47,280
it's something that caters to personal

130
00:05:47,280 --> 00:05:50,220
data or patient data then obviously you

131
00:05:50,220 --> 00:05:52,919
have there's a lot more expected out of

132
00:05:52,919 --> 00:05:54,960
the minimum set of security controls so

133
00:05:54,960 --> 00:05:57,240
I think that is very important to

134
00:05:57,240 --> 00:06:00,539
identify what is the bare minimum thing

135
00:06:00,539 --> 00:06:03,060
that you need to do in terms of your

136
00:06:03,060 --> 00:06:04,919
solution in terms of your product or in

137
00:06:04,919 --> 00:06:07,580
terms of your system

138
00:06:08,340 --> 00:06:11,960
security by Design yes again

139
00:06:11,960 --> 00:06:16,080
uh very important concept uh I can talk

140
00:06:16,080 --> 00:06:18,479
hours and hours about this but okay just

141
00:06:18,479 --> 00:06:20,280
in one slide

142
00:06:20,280 --> 00:06:23,520
the solution should be designed in a way

143
00:06:23,520 --> 00:06:26,639
that you can always add extra layers of

144
00:06:26,639 --> 00:06:29,520
security or you know modify the the way

145
00:06:29,520 --> 00:06:33,360
the security is implemented or enforced

146
00:06:33,360 --> 00:06:35,580
at any given point of time it has to be

147
00:06:35,580 --> 00:06:37,800
flexible it has to be uh you know

148
00:06:37,800 --> 00:06:41,100
configurable in the sense uh you know

149
00:06:41,100 --> 00:06:44,699
you can't really say that I will do it

150
00:06:44,699 --> 00:06:47,100
later you cannot put those controls

151
00:06:47,100 --> 00:06:49,860
later you have to have it part of your

152
00:06:49,860 --> 00:06:51,780
design so

153
00:06:51,780 --> 00:06:53,120
um I think

154
00:06:53,120 --> 00:06:56,100
uh very important for everybody to

155
00:06:56,100 --> 00:06:59,160
understand that uh you know

156
00:06:59,160 --> 00:07:02,699
the security is best enforced from the

157
00:07:02,699 --> 00:07:05,759
architecture side you can't say that you

158
00:07:05,759 --> 00:07:08,699
know my architecture is like this and I

159
00:07:08,699 --> 00:07:11,520
will build a security layer around it

160
00:07:11,520 --> 00:07:14,160
it's security is like security by Design

161
00:07:14,160 --> 00:07:16,259
is like your immune system you have to

162
00:07:16,259 --> 00:07:19,139
be strong from within to be able to

163
00:07:19,139 --> 00:07:22,400
fight all the external you know

164
00:07:22,400 --> 00:07:25,319
pathogens viruses and all that stuff so

165
00:07:25,319 --> 00:07:27,000
I think that is what is important to

166
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:30,060
understand the the core or the Crux of

167
00:07:30,060 --> 00:07:32,819
security design is that it is something

168
00:07:32,819 --> 00:07:35,220
which is enforced by the architecture it

169
00:07:35,220 --> 00:07:37,979
is something that comes from within you

170
00:07:37,979 --> 00:07:42,620
can't really do it from the outset

171
00:07:43,560 --> 00:07:47,400
CIA track very important you know again

172
00:07:47,400 --> 00:07:50,280
this is a foundation of information

173
00:07:50,280 --> 00:07:54,360
security but even for uh product

174
00:07:54,360 --> 00:07:56,639
security you know product application

175
00:07:56,639 --> 00:07:58,680
security system security

176
00:07:58,680 --> 00:08:01,560
just focus on these three important

177
00:08:01,560 --> 00:08:03,479
aspects and I think you should you would

178
00:08:03,479 --> 00:08:06,060
have a smooth sailing so focus on the

179
00:08:06,060 --> 00:08:08,580
confidentiality of the data Maybe data

180
00:08:08,580 --> 00:08:11,160
at rest or in motion or on which is on

181
00:08:11,160 --> 00:08:14,280
the display just make sure that it the

182
00:08:14,280 --> 00:08:16,380
right data is displayed at the right

183
00:08:16,380 --> 00:08:20,099
uh place and to the right person that is

184
00:08:20,099 --> 00:08:24,240
very important uh Integrity be it data

185
00:08:24,240 --> 00:08:26,580
transaction or anything else you know

186
00:08:26,580 --> 00:08:29,580
make sure that your system has Ways and

187
00:08:29,580 --> 00:08:32,640
Means to ensure the Integrity of the

188
00:08:32,640 --> 00:08:35,099
data verify the Integrity of the data

189
00:08:35,099 --> 00:08:38,039
and you know make sure that it kind of

190
00:08:38,039 --> 00:08:40,260
stays in in that state

191
00:08:40,260 --> 00:08:44,099
and availability is Paramount I think uh

192
00:08:44,099 --> 00:08:47,820
some of one of the most exploited Triad

193
00:08:47,820 --> 00:08:51,180
is the availability part where this

194
00:08:51,180 --> 00:08:54,620
system just simply just goes out of

195
00:08:54,620 --> 00:08:58,860
uh you know reach of the legitimate user

196
00:08:58,860 --> 00:09:02,040
and you know that causes more business

197
00:09:02,040 --> 00:09:03,959
damage than anything else

198
00:09:03,959 --> 00:09:06,060
so you know I think these three things

199
00:09:06,060 --> 00:09:09,180
aspects have to be very uh you know

200
00:09:09,180 --> 00:09:13,380
importantly focused uh at the time of uh

201
00:09:13,380 --> 00:09:16,800
designing uh Your solution uh Solutions

202
00:09:16,800 --> 00:09:21,439
security architecture right

203
00:09:22,459 --> 00:09:25,140
secure development practices I think

204
00:09:25,140 --> 00:09:27,540
this was also one of the three pillars

205
00:09:27,540 --> 00:09:29,940
that I have mentioned so

206
00:09:29,940 --> 00:09:32,279
um if you really talk about uh secure

207
00:09:32,279 --> 00:09:34,920
development practices okay so if you

208
00:09:34,920 --> 00:09:37,500
talk about development yeah static

209
00:09:37,500 --> 00:09:39,660
application security testing you know

210
00:09:39,660 --> 00:09:42,959
secure quote review uh

211
00:09:42,959 --> 00:09:45,480
making sure what is written in the code

212
00:09:45,480 --> 00:09:49,140
can not or will not create problems in

213
00:09:49,140 --> 00:09:52,380
the future uh you know I think that is

214
00:09:52,380 --> 00:09:55,140
very important and uh yeah you have a

215
00:09:55,140 --> 00:09:57,060
lot of tools that you can use there you

216
00:09:57,060 --> 00:09:58,740
use uh

217
00:09:58,740 --> 00:10:00,839
uh you know can you Snick there you can

218
00:10:00,839 --> 00:10:03,839
use a snake code plugins uh the ID

219
00:10:03,839 --> 00:10:07,560
plugins for uh taking care of your

220
00:10:07,560 --> 00:10:09,660
application security requirements for

221
00:10:09,660 --> 00:10:13,200
for this uh source code uh vulnerability

222
00:10:13,200 --> 00:10:15,779
management very important

223
00:10:15,779 --> 00:10:18,779
people I still see people you know with

224
00:10:18,779 --> 00:10:21,899
even after all these supply chain issues

225
00:10:21,899 --> 00:10:25,680
and all those uh incidents that have

226
00:10:25,680 --> 00:10:28,560
happened over the last few years I still

227
00:10:28,560 --> 00:10:30,480
see people developers you know

228
00:10:30,480 --> 00:10:33,240
downloading packages without giving a

229
00:10:33,240 --> 00:10:35,880
thought of how wonderful the package is

230
00:10:35,880 --> 00:10:40,220
as of today and what it you know what is

231
00:10:40,220 --> 00:10:43,860
the going to be the scope of it in in

232
00:10:43,860 --> 00:10:46,740
the future many packages they are

233
00:10:46,740 --> 00:10:48,959
currently not vulnerable but they have

234
00:10:48,959 --> 00:10:52,320
not been updated either for the last few

235
00:10:52,320 --> 00:10:54,540
years you know and that's a that's it

236
00:10:54,540 --> 00:10:56,880
they are not inactive they are not being

237
00:10:56,880 --> 00:11:00,899
actively supported by the owner of the

238
00:11:00,899 --> 00:11:02,339
package now

239
00:11:02,339 --> 00:11:04,680
so do we really actually use such kind

240
00:11:04,680 --> 00:11:08,040
of packages I would say give us all give

241
00:11:08,040 --> 00:11:10,500
a thought look for Alternatives because

242
00:11:10,500 --> 00:11:14,339
if a package is not being supported uh

243
00:11:14,339 --> 00:11:16,019
what happens tomorrow if there's a

244
00:11:16,019 --> 00:11:18,300
vulnerability that is detected you know

245
00:11:18,300 --> 00:11:20,519
you are screwed up actually

246
00:11:20,519 --> 00:11:22,320
so

247
00:11:22,320 --> 00:11:24,839
then testing if you talk about testing

248
00:11:24,839 --> 00:11:28,560
yeah very important dust

249
00:11:28,560 --> 00:11:32,519
make sure you use a dash scanner for the

250
00:11:32,519 --> 00:11:35,399
UI your UI should be you know it's it's

251
00:11:35,399 --> 00:11:37,860
like the skin of your system

252
00:11:37,860 --> 00:11:41,160
uh make sure it's protected you know so

253
00:11:41,160 --> 00:11:44,700
it's I think very important uh

254
00:11:44,700 --> 00:11:47,519
fundamentally I think that's just

255
00:11:47,519 --> 00:11:50,880
something that we had long we we were

256
00:11:50,880 --> 00:11:53,160
like we have been seeing it for a long

257
00:11:53,160 --> 00:11:55,560
long time but

258
00:11:55,560 --> 00:11:58,260
so people tend to kind of downplay the

259
00:11:58,260 --> 00:12:01,260
value of test but I in my opinion it is

260
00:12:01,260 --> 00:12:04,260
still very important step in terms of

261
00:12:04,260 --> 00:12:07,560
making sure your system is secure

262
00:12:07,560 --> 00:12:11,100
first testing good concept but

263
00:12:11,100 --> 00:12:13,500
it really gives the benefit if it is

264
00:12:13,500 --> 00:12:15,660
done in the right way with the right

265
00:12:15,660 --> 00:12:18,060
tools and at the right places

266
00:12:18,060 --> 00:12:21,720
so first testing again very important

267
00:12:21,720 --> 00:12:25,019
take some time but do it

268
00:12:25,019 --> 00:12:28,079
chaos engineering again very important

269
00:12:28,079 --> 00:12:32,399
part of making sure your system is uh

270
00:12:32,399 --> 00:12:36,540
resilient against chaotic scenarios uh

271
00:12:36,540 --> 00:12:39,660
your system remains available uh there

272
00:12:39,660 --> 00:12:42,060
are mechanisms in the system that can

273
00:12:42,060 --> 00:12:44,579
handle such chaotic scenarios because

274
00:12:44,579 --> 00:12:47,459
typically for hitting the availability

275
00:12:47,459 --> 00:12:48,980
of the system

276
00:12:48,980 --> 00:12:52,500
uh the attackers will try to create

277
00:12:52,500 --> 00:12:54,480
chaos in your

278
00:12:54,480 --> 00:12:56,459
in our ecosystem so that is very

279
00:12:56,459 --> 00:12:57,779
important

280
00:12:57,779 --> 00:13:01,019
uh deployment fine everybody did

281
00:13:01,019 --> 00:13:02,399
everything you validated everything

282
00:13:02,399 --> 00:13:04,019
everything is running good now you have

283
00:13:04,019 --> 00:13:06,420
deployed so what do you do you

284
00:13:06,420 --> 00:13:08,100
continuously monitor them for

285
00:13:08,100 --> 00:13:10,079
vulnerabilities make sure that you pass

286
00:13:10,079 --> 00:13:11,940
them proactively

287
00:13:11,940 --> 00:13:16,800
and uh also do of good monitoring of the

288
00:13:16,800 --> 00:13:18,839
solutions see what is happening in the

289
00:13:18,839 --> 00:13:22,680
logs uh see the behaviors uh watch out

290
00:13:22,680 --> 00:13:26,399
for spikes watch out for uh some unusual

291
00:13:26,399 --> 00:13:30,959
set of requests and unusual steps uh you

292
00:13:30,959 --> 00:13:33,300
know stuff happening on on your on on

293
00:13:33,300 --> 00:13:36,720
your server instance or pod or cluster

294
00:13:36,720 --> 00:13:37,800
whatever

295
00:13:37,800 --> 00:13:41,220
but be a little Vigilant uh you know and

296
00:13:41,220 --> 00:13:43,740
that is what is very important so if you

297
00:13:43,740 --> 00:13:46,380
kind of do all these three things uh

298
00:13:46,380 --> 00:13:49,440
together in the right amount and in the

299
00:13:49,440 --> 00:13:53,160
right manner I think you have a

300
00:13:53,160 --> 00:13:58,160
good and uh you know great secure system

301
00:13:58,500 --> 00:14:02,279
uh vulnerability management obviously

302
00:14:02,279 --> 00:14:06,000
again a concept but yes if you look at

303
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:08,700
the life cycle there's a discovery phase

304
00:14:08,700 --> 00:14:11,100
prioritization phase assessment phase

305
00:14:11,100 --> 00:14:13,440
reporting phase remediation phase and

306
00:14:13,440 --> 00:14:16,320
verification phase but very important

307
00:14:16,320 --> 00:14:18,899
that we do the vulnerability management

308
00:14:18,899 --> 00:14:21,660
we have a proper governance around it

309
00:14:21,660 --> 00:14:24,000
and we have a proper mechanism to do a

310
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:26,040
vulnerability Management in terms of

311
00:14:26,040 --> 00:14:28,800
software that we use in terms of the

312
00:14:28,800 --> 00:14:31,800
supply chain of the software and in

313
00:14:31,800 --> 00:14:33,660
terms of you know even internal

314
00:14:33,660 --> 00:14:36,480
components that we might be using uh in

315
00:14:36,480 --> 00:14:39,660
a solution or in a in a product

316
00:14:39,660 --> 00:14:41,760
and uh

317
00:14:41,760 --> 00:14:44,880
yeah security testing if we talk about

318
00:14:44,880 --> 00:14:47,220
in little more detail uh

319
00:14:47,220 --> 00:14:49,079
go through a structured approach you

320
00:14:49,079 --> 00:14:51,300
know 90 people say security testing is

321
00:14:51,300 --> 00:14:54,360
all about pen testing no it is part of

322
00:14:54,360 --> 00:14:57,180
it but there has to be some structure

323
00:14:57,180 --> 00:14:59,339
prepare a security test plan very

324
00:14:59,339 --> 00:15:03,480
important uh when you I am still like

325
00:15:03,480 --> 00:15:06,420
old school I still ask for security test

326
00:15:06,420 --> 00:15:09,060
plan I still ask people to identify

327
00:15:09,060 --> 00:15:11,040
security test cases

328
00:15:11,040 --> 00:15:13,139
very important because

329
00:15:13,139 --> 00:15:16,019
um it cannot be ad hoc systems are not

330
00:15:16,019 --> 00:15:18,420
like that you cannot just test a Madoka

331
00:15:18,420 --> 00:15:21,540
uh focus on edge cases that is where the

332
00:15:21,540 --> 00:15:24,360
problem is most of the time and

333
00:15:24,360 --> 00:15:26,399
always prefer automation

334
00:15:26,399 --> 00:15:28,800
it's a one-time effort but once you do

335
00:15:28,800 --> 00:15:31,079
it you know you are going to reap the

336
00:15:31,079 --> 00:15:34,219
benefits in the longer term

337
00:15:34,440 --> 00:15:37,440
so conclusion

338
00:15:37,440 --> 00:15:38,160
um

339
00:15:38,160 --> 00:15:40,199
is to to outline a defensive product

340
00:15:40,199 --> 00:15:41,820
strategy it's a basically a

341
00:15:41,820 --> 00:15:44,279
well-balanced approach of all the

342
00:15:44,279 --> 00:15:46,620
aspects outlined before in the slides

343
00:15:46,620 --> 00:15:49,079
it's a multi-tiered approach

344
00:15:49,079 --> 00:15:51,779
is always preferred for a product or a

345
00:15:51,779 --> 00:15:54,600
system security and we have to raise the

346
00:15:54,600 --> 00:15:58,019
bar always so do it iteratively make

347
00:15:58,019 --> 00:16:00,120
best use of the agile practices but

348
00:16:00,120 --> 00:16:02,820
raise the bar always you know I think

349
00:16:02,820 --> 00:16:07,260
that is the key to have uh you know a

350
00:16:07,260 --> 00:16:10,139
good life with a secure

351
00:16:10,139 --> 00:16:13,199
product and a secure solution I think

352
00:16:13,199 --> 00:16:16,639
that is I think if you follow these

353
00:16:16,639 --> 00:16:20,820
mantras I pretty sure that you will

354
00:16:20,820 --> 00:16:25,139
Your solution will stay secure and you

355
00:16:25,139 --> 00:16:28,079
know will really be resilient against uh

356
00:16:28,079 --> 00:16:31,380
various attacks and all the bad guys you

357
00:16:31,380 --> 00:16:34,019
know so I think that is all shilpi that

358
00:16:34,019 --> 00:16:36,540
I wanted to share I would be happy to

359
00:16:36,540 --> 00:16:40,259
take questions uh at this stage amazing

360
00:16:40,259 --> 00:16:42,420
no thank you so much I really really

361
00:16:42,420 --> 00:16:44,279
enjoyed the talk and I think I've loved

362
00:16:44,279 --> 00:16:46,380
your analogy with the immune system like

363
00:16:46,380 --> 00:16:47,880
I think I've actually not heard that one

364
00:16:47,880 --> 00:16:49,079
from before but I think I'm going to

365
00:16:49,079 --> 00:16:51,240
actually steal it being strong from the

366
00:16:51,240 --> 00:16:54,000
inside I think that's a great great way

367
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:56,519
to describe it so definitely have um you

368
00:16:56,519 --> 00:16:58,019
know enjoyed that and the talk was good

369
00:16:58,019 --> 00:17:00,000
I think I'm impressed by how people are

370
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:02,100
being able to squeeze so much value and

371
00:17:02,100 --> 00:17:04,079
you know just 15. yeah I think that that

372
00:17:04,079 --> 00:17:06,480
is the beauty of the lightning talk you

373
00:17:06,480 --> 00:17:10,020
have to really be concise and so I

374
00:17:10,020 --> 00:17:12,419
really love this great great concept

375
00:17:12,419 --> 00:17:15,900
great execution you know from Iceland

376
00:17:15,900 --> 00:17:18,059
yeah thank you so much and I did have a

377
00:17:18,059 --> 00:17:20,459
very quick question so um I've got a

378
00:17:20,459 --> 00:17:21,839
question from Randall here who's

379
00:17:21,839 --> 00:17:24,179
watching us on YouTube how do you get

380
00:17:24,179 --> 00:17:27,179
started doing this at a small company he

381
00:17:27,179 --> 00:17:29,700
was working at a startup and he thinks

382
00:17:29,700 --> 00:17:31,620
it would be tricky to convince other

383
00:17:31,620 --> 00:17:34,980
Engineers to set this up yeah so I would

384
00:17:34,980 --> 00:17:37,440
say if it's a small company uh you know

385
00:17:37,440 --> 00:17:40,260
if you want to really start just start

386
00:17:40,260 --> 00:17:42,120
with the secure development practices

387
00:17:42,120 --> 00:17:44,520
first I think that is what the

388
00:17:44,520 --> 00:17:47,100
developers will easily correlate with

389
00:17:47,100 --> 00:17:49,740
you if you start talking about Security

390
00:17:49,740 --> 00:17:52,980
based learning security by Design you

391
00:17:52,980 --> 00:17:55,380
know those are obviously slightly high

392
00:17:55,380 --> 00:17:58,320
level Concepts where they might need

393
00:17:58,320 --> 00:18:01,620
certain guidance but secure development

394
00:18:01,620 --> 00:18:03,720
practices get the tools in place you

395
00:18:03,720 --> 00:18:07,440
know I think uh you know Snick is

396
00:18:07,440 --> 00:18:09,780
exactly defined or designed for such

397
00:18:09,780 --> 00:18:11,580
kind of a setup where you don't have

398
00:18:11,580 --> 00:18:13,679
anything and you want to immediately

399
00:18:13,679 --> 00:18:16,320
start and immediately reap the benefits

400
00:18:16,320 --> 00:18:18,900
you know use the platform it has

401
00:18:18,900 --> 00:18:22,020
everything that uh you need to have a

402
00:18:22,020 --> 00:18:25,260
secure development environment in terms

403
00:18:25,260 --> 00:18:27,900
of making sure your code is right your

404
00:18:27,900 --> 00:18:31,919
supply chain is validated uh you know a

405
00:18:31,919 --> 00:18:34,440
lot of things are coming up uh even from

406
00:18:34,440 --> 00:18:37,320
the deployment aspects so yeah I think

407
00:18:37,320 --> 00:18:39,660
just start with with a simple set of

408
00:18:39,660 --> 00:18:40,559
tools

409
00:18:40,559 --> 00:18:43,380
start with a good healthy uh secure

410
00:18:43,380 --> 00:18:45,960
development practices I think that would

411
00:18:45,960 --> 00:18:48,840
be the starting point of for such a use

412
00:18:48,840 --> 00:18:51,059
case amazing thank you so much I think

413
00:18:51,059 --> 00:18:52,380
that's great advice I think I'm loving

414
00:18:52,380 --> 00:18:55,140
how the the information is being laid up

415
00:18:55,140 --> 00:18:57,539
we did have you know earlier mid saying

416
00:18:57,539 --> 00:18:59,580
you know start with good intent and you

417
00:18:59,580 --> 00:19:01,080
know you've LED that up and saying good

418
00:19:01,080 --> 00:19:03,179
you know security practices so I'm

419
00:19:03,179 --> 00:19:05,760
loving you know the conversations here

420
00:19:05,760 --> 00:19:07,020
um thank you so much again someone for

421
00:19:07,020 --> 00:19:09,918
joining us and for the talk
