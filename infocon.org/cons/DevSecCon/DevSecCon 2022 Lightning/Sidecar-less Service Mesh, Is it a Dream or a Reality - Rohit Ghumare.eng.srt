00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,580
to the next lightning talk we have Rohit

2
00:00:02,580 --> 00:00:05,640
gumar and Rohit is a Founder at

3
00:00:05,640 --> 00:00:09,000
trainings and internships and he's also

4
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:11,179
a hybrid multi-cloud intern

5
00:00:11,179 --> 00:00:15,360
Rohit is very a very much a devops

6
00:00:15,360 --> 00:00:17,580
Advocate and he's also a community

7
00:00:17,580 --> 00:00:19,920
evangelist running multiple communities

on various platforms to create awareness

9
00:00:22,560 --> 00:00:25,859
for devops and devrel he also often

10
00:00:25,859 --> 00:00:28,500
contributes to open source by presenting

11
00:00:28,500 --> 00:00:32,700
talks biting dogs dogs not dogs Vlogs

12
00:00:32,700 --> 00:00:34,920
and code contributions and he's

13
00:00:34,920 --> 00:00:38,219
currently working on service mesh Tech

14
00:00:38,219 --> 00:00:39,899
stack there we go

15
00:00:39,899 --> 00:00:42,180
and today his lightning talk is on

16
00:00:42,180 --> 00:00:44,940
sidecar list service mesh is it a dream

17
00:00:44,940 --> 00:00:46,559
or a reality

18
00:00:46,559 --> 00:00:48,059
amazing

19
00:00:48,059 --> 00:00:50,280
welcome on board Rohit we are so excited

20
00:00:50,280 --> 00:00:52,860
to have you and so much mesh is one of

21
00:00:52,860 --> 00:00:54,120
those things that everyone's talking

22
00:00:54,120 --> 00:00:57,300
about in 2022 uh so I think we're all

23
00:00:57,300 --> 00:00:59,579
really really Keen to hear more about

24
00:00:59,579 --> 00:01:00,420
this

25
00:01:00,420 --> 00:01:02,160
I'm gonna add

26
00:01:02,160 --> 00:01:04,979
um okay

27
00:01:04,979 --> 00:01:06,720
um if you can just add your slide deck

28
00:01:06,720 --> 00:01:09,360
to it and then we can share it as well

29
00:01:09,360 --> 00:01:12,200
for you

30
00:01:12,439 --> 00:01:15,659
let me directly go to the channel and

31
00:01:15,659 --> 00:01:18,299
let me start sharing my screen is it

32
00:01:18,299 --> 00:01:19,680
visible

33
00:01:19,680 --> 00:01:22,500
awesome yes we are all ready to go so

34
00:01:22,500 --> 00:01:24,180
Uma and I will just go back in the

35
00:01:24,180 --> 00:01:25,500
background and we'll let you take it

36
00:01:25,500 --> 00:01:26,700
away

37
00:01:26,700 --> 00:01:28,560
okay okay thank you thank you for a cool

38
00:01:28,560 --> 00:01:29,640
introduction

39
00:01:29,640 --> 00:01:31,979
so let's start with our today's session

40
00:01:31,979 --> 00:01:34,259
which is the uh suicide careless service

41
00:01:34,259 --> 00:01:37,200
is it a dream or reality so what is this

42
00:01:37,200 --> 00:01:39,439
term

43
00:01:51,979 --> 00:01:55,079
so what is that things right so that's

44
00:01:55,079 --> 00:01:58,380
why I'm here uh so that we will talk

45
00:01:58,380 --> 00:02:00,600
about them more on the same and we will

46
00:02:00,600 --> 00:02:02,540
introduce it

47
00:02:02,540 --> 00:02:06,659
so uh talking about uh myself is like

48
00:02:06,659 --> 00:02:09,598
I'm developed okay at solo.io which is

49
00:02:09,598 --> 00:02:11,879
company working on various things uh

50
00:02:11,879 --> 00:02:14,040
like your application networking your

51
00:02:14,040 --> 00:02:16,980
API gateways service mesh and many

52
00:02:16,980 --> 00:02:19,379
things so I'm little otaku so that's why

53
00:02:19,379 --> 00:02:22,379
that emoji uh other than that this is

54
00:02:22,379 --> 00:02:25,319
founder of communities so I'm founder of

55
00:02:25,319 --> 00:02:27,239
various communities like keep up devops

56
00:02:27,239 --> 00:02:28,379
Community developer relation security

57
00:02:28,379 --> 00:02:31,379
Google communities AWS communities and

58
00:02:31,379 --> 00:02:33,599
if you want to connect with me and have

59
00:02:33,599 --> 00:02:36,420
a chat with me and if you have doubts

60
00:02:36,420 --> 00:02:38,580
around the Box world or developer

61
00:02:38,580 --> 00:02:41,340
lessons uh you can anytime ping me and I

62
00:02:41,340 --> 00:02:43,739
will happy to share to the insights on

63
00:02:43,739 --> 00:02:46,860
the same so other than that uh talking

64
00:02:46,860 --> 00:02:49,379
about my company it is like solo dot IO

65
00:02:49,379 --> 00:02:52,860
uh as we know uh we have glue products

66
00:02:52,860 --> 00:02:55,800
which is like uh connect which can you

67
00:02:55,800 --> 00:02:58,019
connect if your API gateways service

68
00:02:58,019 --> 00:03:01,440
mesh and it is Open Source Products and

69
00:03:01,440 --> 00:03:03,959
some Enterprise products so depending on

70
00:03:03,959 --> 00:03:05,959
your risk you can go ahead with the same

71
00:03:05,959 --> 00:03:09,239
so let's move ahead like what was the

72
00:03:09,239 --> 00:03:11,580
thing before the serviceman right

73
00:03:11,580 --> 00:03:15,300
so uh you know micro Services right so

74
00:03:15,300 --> 00:03:16,440
there are different types of micro

75
00:03:16,440 --> 00:03:20,220
services but if you want to connect one

76
00:03:20,220 --> 00:03:22,560
service with the another service that is

77
00:03:22,560 --> 00:03:25,319
like that should be set

78
00:03:25,319 --> 00:03:27,360
your overlay there should be security

79
00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:28,980
there should be some certificates

80
00:03:28,980 --> 00:03:31,680
assigned to it that should be traffic uh

81
00:03:31,680 --> 00:03:34,200
there should be packet sending uh you

82
00:03:34,200 --> 00:03:36,360
you got as a network packets right so if

83
00:03:36,360 --> 00:03:37,680
you are sending the network packets

84
00:03:37,680 --> 00:03:40,080
there should be some uh resources there

85
00:03:40,080 --> 00:03:43,319
should be various things to add and in

86
00:03:43,319 --> 00:03:45,599
the in the professional what we called

87
00:03:45,599 --> 00:03:48,780
as it as like business logic we can we

88
00:03:48,780 --> 00:03:50,040
have to add some business logic

89
00:03:50,040 --> 00:03:52,620
otherwise we will not get the use case

90
00:03:52,620 --> 00:03:55,680
sold right so

91
00:03:55,680 --> 00:03:57,840
before service mesh there was like

92
00:03:57,840 --> 00:04:00,360
operational code and business logic was

93
00:04:00,360 --> 00:04:03,959
like tricky tricky one and uh it was

94
00:04:03,959 --> 00:04:07,080
really hard to uh separate them and uh

95
00:04:07,080 --> 00:04:10,680
so uh many many problems happened so

96
00:04:10,680 --> 00:04:13,140
what happens in the service mesh we

97
00:04:13,140 --> 00:04:16,199
created some uh like parallel between

98
00:04:16,199 --> 00:04:18,540
the both of them so operational code and

99
00:04:18,540 --> 00:04:20,940
business logic is side by side and

100
00:04:20,940 --> 00:04:22,800
whenever you want to add the resources

101
00:04:22,800 --> 00:04:25,080
to your operational code you can do it

102
00:04:25,080 --> 00:04:28,320
anytime you want to uh do some use cases

103
00:04:28,320 --> 00:04:31,080
uh swimming and kind of everything on

104
00:04:31,080 --> 00:04:33,540
your applications you can do it anytime

105
00:04:33,540 --> 00:04:36,360
so that's why that is your service mesh

106
00:04:36,360 --> 00:04:39,979
so let's Deep dive into the same

107
00:04:39,979 --> 00:04:42,900
so as you see uh there are various

108
00:04:42,900 --> 00:04:45,479
service mesh functions so so service

109
00:04:45,479 --> 00:04:48,419
noise functions is nothing but what the

110
00:04:48,419 --> 00:04:51,180
service mesh can do so it can help you

111
00:04:51,180 --> 00:04:52,800
with the service Discovery so service

112
00:04:52,800 --> 00:04:54,840
Discovery is the one of the thing uh

113
00:04:54,840 --> 00:04:58,620
kubernetes is can also do but when we're

114
00:04:58,620 --> 00:05:00,720
talking about the secure service to

115
00:05:00,720 --> 00:05:02,520
service communication it can be only

116
00:05:02,520 --> 00:05:05,280
done by this your service mesh so one of

117
00:05:05,280 --> 00:05:07,139
the service mesh I really promote which

118
00:05:07,139 --> 00:05:09,180
is your istio service mesh it is open

119
00:05:09,180 --> 00:05:12,840
source and anyone can use any anytime so

120
00:05:12,840 --> 00:05:15,240
another thing that a traffic control

121
00:05:15,240 --> 00:05:18,240
shaping shifting circuit breaking fault

122
00:05:18,240 --> 00:05:21,000
injection these are the various uh these

123
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:23,580
are the various uh Elson policies we say

124
00:05:23,580 --> 00:05:26,580
so what what is the thing

125
00:05:26,580 --> 00:05:31,080
if you need some uh if you need some

126
00:05:31,080 --> 00:05:33,539
like if you're sending one packet to

127
00:05:33,539 --> 00:05:37,259
another another service then there is

128
00:05:37,259 --> 00:05:39,000
will be some control over that traffic

129
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:41,759
right uh and that should be if you want

130
00:05:41,759 --> 00:05:44,759
to shift the in between of that packets

131
00:05:44,759 --> 00:05:47,280
you can do it easily by using the

132
00:05:47,280 --> 00:05:50,039
service measure and for this uh

133
00:05:50,039 --> 00:05:52,800
visualize it there is you can connect to

134
00:05:52,800 --> 00:05:55,800
various dashboards uh for the monitoring

135
00:05:55,800 --> 00:05:58,979
and you can view it as easily so policy

136
00:05:58,979 --> 00:06:02,460
and intention based Access Control what

137
00:06:02,460 --> 00:06:06,000
is that so similar to uh PowerPoint you

138
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:09,120
can check whenever you want the uh

139
00:06:09,120 --> 00:06:11,039
whenever you want to attach policy you

140
00:06:11,039 --> 00:06:14,160
want to uh give some priorities to it

141
00:06:14,160 --> 00:06:15,900
you want to see like what is happening

142
00:06:15,900 --> 00:06:18,060
inside that or you want to assign it

143
00:06:18,060 --> 00:06:20,759
really well so you can do it easily here

144
00:06:20,759 --> 00:06:23,280
traffic metric collection

145
00:06:23,280 --> 00:06:26,400
so what happens if you are working the

146
00:06:26,400 --> 00:06:30,660
services you need some uh like you you

147
00:06:30,660 --> 00:06:32,639
need some visualization right that's

148
00:06:32,639 --> 00:06:35,819
what I told so I generally recommend to

149
00:06:35,819 --> 00:06:37,620
use the key Ali your promise graph money

150
00:06:37,620 --> 00:06:39,660
because they are open source so what

151
00:06:39,660 --> 00:06:43,979
happens uh when there is so service mesh

152
00:06:43,979 --> 00:06:45,539
is like we disconnect in the various

153
00:06:45,539 --> 00:06:47,340
micro Services it is connecting the

154
00:06:47,340 --> 00:06:49,740
different applications right so when it

155
00:06:49,740 --> 00:06:52,740
is connecting that thing uh so uh there

156
00:06:52,740 --> 00:06:55,979
is like too much web so that that's why

157
00:06:55,979 --> 00:06:58,199
it is called a service mesh right but to

158
00:06:58,199 --> 00:07:00,120
visualize it easily you need some kind

159
00:07:00,120 --> 00:07:02,580
of a dashboards and to get this type

160
00:07:02,580 --> 00:07:04,800
dashboards up you need some traffic

161
00:07:04,800 --> 00:07:07,860
metric collection so if you get some

162
00:07:07,860 --> 00:07:10,440
traffic metrics you can connect it to

163
00:07:10,440 --> 00:07:14,280
your uh visualization uh dashboard so

164
00:07:14,280 --> 00:07:15,900
that is what you can do it easily

165
00:07:15,900 --> 00:07:17,880
through this service mesh and other than

166
00:07:17,880 --> 00:07:19,979
there is a service resiliency which

167
00:07:19,979 --> 00:07:22,979
everyone knows and then is uh your API

168
00:07:22,979 --> 00:07:25,620
program sample interface so it is just

169
00:07:25,620 --> 00:07:28,259
you can it is easily available in

170
00:07:28,259 --> 00:07:30,419
interface and you can connect it to the

171
00:07:30,419 --> 00:07:33,240
apis API get waste and you can program

172
00:07:33,240 --> 00:07:35,580
it accordingly

173
00:07:35,580 --> 00:07:38,340
so platform goes with the service mesh

174
00:07:38,340 --> 00:07:42,000
is simple so you just need the uh at the

175
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:44,580
so you have the osm model right in your

176
00:07:44,580 --> 00:07:47,340
in your college also you just thought

177
00:07:47,340 --> 00:07:49,020
like there is some computer networking

178
00:07:49,020 --> 00:07:52,199
subject so inside that there are various

179
00:07:52,199 --> 00:07:54,780
layers from layer 1 to layer seven so

180
00:07:54,780 --> 00:07:57,060
application Level comes under your like

181
00:07:57,060 --> 00:08:00,919
uh I guess your seventh player right so

182
00:08:00,919 --> 00:08:06,060
inside that uh you have some

183
00:08:06,060 --> 00:08:08,819
uh your application Level you have some

184
00:08:08,819 --> 00:08:10,800
traffic routing so what is traffic

185
00:08:10,800 --> 00:08:13,259
routing so when you are spending some

186
00:08:13,259 --> 00:08:15,419
traffic from one point to another you

187
00:08:15,419 --> 00:08:17,880
need some uh access to it control to it

188
00:08:17,880 --> 00:08:19,740
right so traffic routing is one way

189
00:08:19,740 --> 00:08:21,479
other than that there is a filtering

190
00:08:21,479 --> 00:08:23,520
transformation so whatever you are

191
00:08:23,520 --> 00:08:26,099
sending the package you need to uh you

192
00:08:26,099 --> 00:08:27,780
need to have some access on the same and

193
00:08:27,780 --> 00:08:29,879
then you can access it accordingly for

194
00:08:29,879 --> 00:08:32,580
filter transformation shaping various

195
00:08:32,580 --> 00:08:34,380
things you can do so that is one of the

196
00:08:34,380 --> 00:08:36,419
goal for the service mesh then there is

197
00:08:36,419 --> 00:08:38,760
the observerity which I called right so

198
00:08:38,760 --> 00:08:41,820
you you should have some logs you you

199
00:08:41,820 --> 00:08:43,799
can easily capture the traffic you can

200
00:08:43,799 --> 00:08:46,320
metric it and then you can share it to

201
00:08:46,320 --> 00:08:48,779
the monitoring tools to uh so you need

202
00:08:48,779 --> 00:08:50,880
some integration to connect it right so

203
00:08:50,880 --> 00:08:53,040
if we uh is to a service search provide

204
00:08:53,040 --> 00:08:55,219
that

205
00:08:57,800 --> 00:09:00,480
ability so all comes under your security

206
00:09:00,480 --> 00:09:06,240
once so what happens uh uh when you are

207
00:09:06,240 --> 00:09:10,320
working with your uh network security uh

208
00:09:10,320 --> 00:09:12,660
sometimes you can see like you have some

209
00:09:12,660 --> 00:09:14,820
application like which outside world

210
00:09:14,820 --> 00:09:17,279
Corner cannot access or something so you

211
00:09:17,279 --> 00:09:19,380
need to use some fault injection you

212
00:09:19,380 --> 00:09:21,839
need to do some circuit breaking on same

213
00:09:21,839 --> 00:09:24,620
so you can enable it anytime using the

214
00:09:24,620 --> 00:09:27,060
use these tools

215
00:09:27,060 --> 00:09:29,519
other than that there is your zero trust

216
00:09:29,519 --> 00:09:32,040
security so zero trust is one of the key

217
00:09:32,040 --> 00:09:35,040
terms uh discussing all over the world

218
00:09:35,040 --> 00:09:37,800
today so what it is you can check

219
00:09:37,800 --> 00:09:40,680
through our workshops we are uh we are

220
00:09:40,680 --> 00:09:43,320
guiding the people on the same so it is

221
00:09:43,320 --> 00:09:45,420
just some kind of a secure communication

222
00:09:45,420 --> 00:09:48,120
if you want uh through the microservices

223
00:09:48,120 --> 00:09:50,880
if you want the certificate attached to

224
00:09:50,880 --> 00:09:54,480
it you you can so in simple words it is

225
00:09:54,480 --> 00:09:56,279
something like when you are sending the

226
00:09:56,279 --> 00:09:58,500
service one to service to uh that will

227
00:09:58,500 --> 00:10:01,740
be a mutual uh TLS connection so mutual

228
00:10:01,740 --> 00:10:04,080
TLS connection is one of the ways you

229
00:10:04,080 --> 00:10:07,080
get your access uh secured and that's

230
00:10:07,080 --> 00:10:10,440
why we use this service

231
00:10:10,440 --> 00:10:12,800
foreign

232
00:10:12,800 --> 00:10:17,100
works today so it has like sir so it has

233
00:10:17,100 --> 00:10:19,560
some data planes and data planes is

234
00:10:19,560 --> 00:10:22,140
connected to the control plane so what

235
00:10:22,140 --> 00:10:23,000
happens

236
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:25,920
uh sitting outside of your uh control

237
00:10:25,920 --> 00:10:28,620
plane and data plane has the service and

238
00:10:28,620 --> 00:10:31,019
service connected to the Android proxy

239
00:10:31,019 --> 00:10:34,500
so we use angular 4C in the H2O so what

240
00:10:34,500 --> 00:10:35,880
happens

241
00:10:35,880 --> 00:10:38,220
uh your service is connected to the

242
00:10:38,220 --> 00:10:40,920
Android process so whenever any resource

243
00:10:40,920 --> 00:10:43,440
addition any service addition you want

244
00:10:43,440 --> 00:10:46,980
to do on your service say uh like you

245
00:10:46,980 --> 00:10:49,079
want to add any resources to it you have

246
00:10:49,079 --> 00:10:50,940
to go through the annual proxy which is

247
00:10:50,940 --> 00:10:53,339
your sidecar so that is your sidecar

248
00:10:53,339 --> 00:10:55,740
whenever you are using anything to your

249
00:10:55,740 --> 00:10:58,019
service uh you have to go to the Android

250
00:10:58,019 --> 00:11:02,760
proxy so uh if you want to assign some

251
00:11:02,760 --> 00:11:05,160
layer for proxies layer for policies

252
00:11:05,160 --> 00:11:08,339
angular flats and traffic you can do it

253
00:11:08,339 --> 00:11:10,740
only through the Android proxy and

254
00:11:10,740 --> 00:11:12,720
control plane is the one who gets every

255
00:11:12,720 --> 00:11:15,899
information you it gets any metrics and

256
00:11:15,899 --> 00:11:18,060
that here is the integration and kind of

257
00:11:18,060 --> 00:11:20,760
things you can do but Android proxy is

258
00:11:20,760 --> 00:11:23,700
the one who will send the Matrix to that

259
00:11:23,700 --> 00:11:27,600
and other than that uh as you see like

260
00:11:27,600 --> 00:11:29,820
control plane is sitting outside of your

261
00:11:29,820 --> 00:11:32,820
data plane and sometimes uh some it is

262
00:11:32,820 --> 00:11:36,000
like uh it is really hard to uh get this

263
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:37,800
thing act or something like security

264
00:11:37,800 --> 00:11:40,560
which can happen but it is possible

265
00:11:40,560 --> 00:11:43,440
because it is sitting outside right so

266
00:11:43,440 --> 00:11:45,240
because control plane is the one who

267
00:11:45,240 --> 00:11:48,060
will do everything for your services we

268
00:11:48,060 --> 00:11:49,920
will deploy proxy she will do the

269
00:11:49,920 --> 00:11:51,839
filtering he will do the policies

270
00:11:51,839 --> 00:11:53,700
attachment and removing kind of a thing

271
00:11:53,700 --> 00:11:56,640
so that's why uh we need some kind of

272
00:11:56,640 --> 00:11:59,040
thing to get this directly connected to

273
00:11:59,040 --> 00:12:01,860
service right because there is really

274
00:12:01,860 --> 00:12:02,839
hard

275
00:12:02,839 --> 00:12:06,959
so as you see here

276
00:12:06,959 --> 00:12:09,600
whatever I told you it is written here

277
00:12:09,600 --> 00:12:11,880
so Matrix can be get through the sidecar

278
00:12:11,880 --> 00:12:15,240
proxy and your history is your control

279
00:12:15,240 --> 00:12:17,459
plane which is connected to the server

280
00:12:17,459 --> 00:12:20,040
and it's like uh inside the keyboard and

281
00:12:20,040 --> 00:12:22,320
if you can do this discovery right so

282
00:12:22,320 --> 00:12:26,100
that's what I told and uh studies has

283
00:12:26,100 --> 00:12:29,220
every axis of the side effect proxy and

284
00:12:29,220 --> 00:12:32,000
your applications

285
00:12:32,540 --> 00:12:35,820
sidecar model is working today so as you

286
00:12:35,820 --> 00:12:38,700
see application in the node one node

287
00:12:38,700 --> 00:12:41,040
there are different Services there are

288
00:12:41,040 --> 00:12:43,500
different applications inside it so

289
00:12:43,500 --> 00:12:46,320
after applications that is then you can

290
00:12:46,320 --> 00:12:48,600
add the resources to it but resources

291
00:12:48,600 --> 00:12:50,700
can be added through your Android proxy

292
00:12:50,700 --> 00:12:53,519
so it is really complex kind of a

293
00:12:53,519 --> 00:12:56,880
structure right so how complex you can

294
00:12:56,880 --> 00:13:00,180
see here so uh if you have like three

295
00:13:00,180 --> 00:13:02,459
four four Services running

296
00:13:02,459 --> 00:13:05,399
this kind of a web you can see so this

297
00:13:05,399 --> 00:13:07,579
web is really complex and you can't

298
00:13:07,579 --> 00:13:10,500
easily get track of it right so that's

299
00:13:10,500 --> 00:13:13,560
why I added this diagram not to bombard

300
00:13:13,560 --> 00:13:15,540
you with the things but just to show you

301
00:13:15,540 --> 00:13:19,680
like how this looks so if you go step by

302
00:13:19,680 --> 00:13:21,959
step you will see like

303
00:13:21,959 --> 00:13:24,420
policy translation and your service

304
00:13:24,420 --> 00:13:27,360
catalog metrics and everything is

305
00:13:27,360 --> 00:13:29,399
connected to everyone through your

306
00:13:29,399 --> 00:13:31,860
Ingress and Ingress so what is ingress

307
00:13:31,860 --> 00:13:33,720
and Ingress you will come to know if you

308
00:13:33,720 --> 00:13:35,579
are in the cloud kubernetes and Cloud

309
00:13:35,579 --> 00:13:39,540
native world go slowly learn really well

310
00:13:39,540 --> 00:13:42,240
one by one and you will understand so

311
00:13:42,240 --> 00:13:44,160
you can screenshot it and you can do

312
00:13:44,160 --> 00:13:47,279
various things for this uh other than

313
00:13:47,279 --> 00:13:50,100
that what is the potential challenges in

314
00:13:50,100 --> 00:13:52,079
our current sidecar proxies I mean

315
00:13:52,079 --> 00:13:54,959
select current version of istio which is

316
00:13:54,959 --> 00:13:56,820
overhead cost because you have the

317
00:13:56,820 --> 00:13:58,920
various sidecar attached to various

318
00:13:58,920 --> 00:14:01,800
Services applications so it it is

319
00:14:01,800 --> 00:14:04,139
increasing your cost and other than that

320
00:14:04,139 --> 00:14:06,899
it is really complex as I told

321
00:14:06,899 --> 00:14:09,420
after that performance will produce

322
00:14:09,420 --> 00:14:11,459
because you have to go through the

323
00:14:11,459 --> 00:14:13,380
control plane then envelope proxy and

324
00:14:13,380 --> 00:14:15,360
then service so it is simple to

325
00:14:15,360 --> 00:14:16,680
visualize it

326
00:14:16,680 --> 00:14:20,220
and when you uh when you deploy any

327
00:14:20,220 --> 00:14:22,320
application you will see like there are

328
00:14:22,320 --> 00:14:24,779
two parts are running when you deploy

329
00:14:24,779 --> 00:14:27,540
application one is your service uh

330
00:14:27,540 --> 00:14:30,420
service part and one is your uh what we

331
00:14:30,420 --> 00:14:34,560
say one is your side cardboard so same

332
00:14:34,560 --> 00:14:36,899
thing is written here uh in better

333
00:14:36,899 --> 00:14:39,240
visualization as you see like challenges

334
00:14:39,240 --> 00:14:41,760
everywhere so why challenges everywhere

335
00:14:41,760 --> 00:14:44,100
as you see like operational complexity

336
00:14:44,100 --> 00:14:46,740
is there another is application mesh is

337
00:14:46,740 --> 00:14:49,279
not available

338
00:15:14,399 --> 00:15:15,660
so

339
00:15:15,660 --> 00:15:19,500
so what what we can do so future of your

340
00:15:19,500 --> 00:15:21,240
service mesh is happening around your

341
00:15:21,240 --> 00:15:24,959
data plan so as you see uh goes on and

342
00:15:24,959 --> 00:15:26,760
everything which everyone is talking

343
00:15:26,760 --> 00:15:29,760
about so we can do the uh this

344
00:15:29,760 --> 00:15:33,300
Innovations on your sidecar only so

345
00:15:33,300 --> 00:15:36,120
let's do by extending our data plan what

346
00:15:36,120 --> 00:15:39,060
we can do so solo and Google are the

347
00:15:39,060 --> 00:15:41,339
lead contributors to HTM brand mesh and

348
00:15:41,339 --> 00:15:44,339
HTM brand mesh was launched a few few

349
00:15:44,339 --> 00:15:48,120
months back and we istio got also got

350
00:15:48,120 --> 00:15:50,220
accepted into the incubating project for

351
00:15:50,220 --> 00:15:54,060
the cncf so if you want to contribute in

352
00:15:54,060 --> 00:15:57,060
the one of the leading uh projects in

353
00:15:57,060 --> 00:15:59,880
the cncf then istio is the one you can

354
00:15:59,880 --> 00:16:02,040
go out with the same and MB animation is

355
00:16:02,040 --> 00:16:04,680
one of the futurist technology I can say

356
00:16:04,680 --> 00:16:07,440
uh it's news data plan added to the HTO

357
00:16:07,440 --> 00:16:10,199
so what it does it creates the slicing

358
00:16:10,199 --> 00:16:12,899
of the layers of your l4andl server so

359
00:16:12,899 --> 00:16:15,600
whenever you want to use the alpha

360
00:16:15,600 --> 00:16:18,420
things which is your zero trust TCP

361
00:16:18,420 --> 00:16:20,519
routing authorization policy accessing

362
00:16:20,519 --> 00:16:22,380
loggings and kind of thing

363
00:16:22,380 --> 00:16:25,380
you can do it by the layer 4 but when

364
00:16:25,380 --> 00:16:27,779
you need to access logs and you need to

365
00:16:27,779 --> 00:16:30,000
do some fault injections as rate

366
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:32,760
limiting circuit breaking load balancing

367
00:16:32,760 --> 00:16:36,000
kind of a thing you can use the l17 but

368
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:38,940
to buy different proxies right so what

369
00:16:38,940 --> 00:16:41,820
happens uh previously you have whenever

370
00:16:41,820 --> 00:16:43,620
you want to uh

371
00:16:43,620 --> 00:16:47,940
whenever you want to add your Matrix to

372
00:16:47,940 --> 00:16:50,519
uh you see like history of proxy which

373
00:16:50,519 --> 00:16:52,980
is your sidecar your Matrix was going

374
00:16:52,980 --> 00:16:55,320
from this side card to the your

375
00:16:55,320 --> 00:16:57,740
visualization of like observation

376
00:16:57,740 --> 00:16:59,639
integration was done through the side

377
00:16:59,639 --> 00:17:02,279
car but now what will happen it will

378
00:17:02,279 --> 00:17:05,220
scrap your Matrix easily through the

379
00:17:05,220 --> 00:17:07,260
services directly connected to the

380
00:17:07,260 --> 00:17:10,380
visualization so for the future thing we

381
00:17:10,380 --> 00:17:12,780
can also connect it to the ebpf which is

382
00:17:12,780 --> 00:17:14,459
one of the trending technology in the

383
00:17:14,459 --> 00:17:16,020
cute one this year

384
00:17:16,020 --> 00:17:18,839
other than that that if you see whenever

385
00:17:18,839 --> 00:17:21,299
you want The L4 things you just have one

386
00:17:21,299 --> 00:17:24,179
proxy attached to it so as you see only

387
00:17:24,179 --> 00:17:27,059
one proxy per node is there and L7

388
00:17:27,059 --> 00:17:29,280
whenever you want the L7 policies and

389
00:17:29,280 --> 00:17:31,140
certain things you can use the another

390
00:17:31,140 --> 00:17:34,679
proxy which is your Waypoint proxy so I

391
00:17:34,679 --> 00:17:35,940
said

392
00:17:35,940 --> 00:17:38,160
as I am telling you different things

393
00:17:38,160 --> 00:17:40,860
here as you see your post is reduced

394
00:17:40,860 --> 00:17:44,460
because sidecars are videos and now if

395
00:17:44,460 --> 00:17:46,860
this is the thing which you will make

396
00:17:46,860 --> 00:17:49,559
everything clear so we were previously

397
00:17:49,559 --> 00:17:51,740
started proxy for our

398
00:17:51,740 --> 00:17:54,539
architecture but now it is just a proxy

399
00:17:54,539 --> 00:17:56,940
per node architecture so you have one

400
00:17:56,940 --> 00:17:59,400
node and one proxy previously it was

401
00:17:59,400 --> 00:18:01,679
like one node and multiple proxies for

402
00:18:01,679 --> 00:18:05,880
your services so it's General you can

403
00:18:05,880 --> 00:18:09,600
see like it is reducing your uh reducing

404
00:18:09,600 --> 00:18:12,240
your cost for sure other than that it is

405
00:18:12,240 --> 00:18:14,460
also reducing your uh what we say

406
00:18:14,460 --> 00:18:17,220
previously when you have to deploy your

407
00:18:17,220 --> 00:18:19,740
application what was happening it was

408
00:18:19,740 --> 00:18:21,600
restarting your application whenever you

409
00:18:21,600 --> 00:18:24,720
are adding because it it it's allowing

410
00:18:24,720 --> 00:18:27,299
you only to add the start or add at the

411
00:18:27,299 --> 00:18:30,059
end so now it is not like that you can

412
00:18:30,059 --> 00:18:32,220
assign the data plane anytime you want

413
00:18:32,220 --> 00:18:34,080
you just have to label new data plane

414
00:18:34,080 --> 00:18:35,640
which is history ambient plane and you

415
00:18:35,640 --> 00:18:37,740
can add application attached application

416
00:18:37,740 --> 00:18:40,020
anytime you want

417
00:18:40,020 --> 00:18:43,140
so what it means for your wallet and how

418
00:18:43,140 --> 00:18:44,820
the cost is reduced because that is

419
00:18:44,820 --> 00:18:47,039
company wants right so as you see

420
00:18:47,039 --> 00:18:49,380
previously in the side car you needed

421
00:18:49,380 --> 00:18:51,720
three virtual CPUs more than that and

422
00:18:51,720 --> 00:18:54,960
this memory you can see but now for The

423
00:18:54,960 --> 00:18:58,500
L4 it is just including 384 and if you

424
00:18:58,500 --> 00:19:00,600
want the iPhone and install both then it

425
00:19:00,600 --> 00:19:04,200
is just 768 MLBs uh other than that

426
00:19:04,200 --> 00:19:07,500
that's the CPU is also reduced too much

427
00:19:07,500 --> 00:19:10,260
so this is the visualization of a

428
00:19:10,260 --> 00:19:12,179
latency which we talked about two years

429
00:19:12,179 --> 00:19:14,160
later it was like two millisecond to one

430
00:19:14,160 --> 00:19:16,860
to one and then for the entire thing it

431
00:19:16,860 --> 00:19:19,320
was just four millisecond but now it is

432
00:19:19,320 --> 00:19:21,000
just a three milliseconds for that cell

433
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:24,240
it is really small year like you still

434
00:19:24,240 --> 00:19:26,700
like it is not making any difference but

435
00:19:26,700 --> 00:19:29,220
when you connect different Services then

436
00:19:29,220 --> 00:19:32,400
it is really big architecture and uh

437
00:19:32,400 --> 00:19:33,720
doing that application one to

438
00:19:33,720 --> 00:19:35,580
application will do then service one to

439
00:19:35,580 --> 00:19:37,080
service two there are multiple

440
00:19:37,080 --> 00:19:39,240
applications and multiple Services it

441
00:19:39,240 --> 00:19:41,820
will really benefit you

442
00:19:41,820 --> 00:19:45,179
so all uh all your use cases are solved

443
00:19:45,179 --> 00:19:47,520
by the HDM brand mesh and as you see

444
00:19:47,520 --> 00:19:50,100
everything I told here uh told today

445
00:19:50,100 --> 00:19:52,440
everything is available here like mesh

446
00:19:52,440 --> 00:19:54,480
transparent application recover proxy

447
00:19:54,480 --> 00:19:56,780
deep couple proxy and then this is

448
00:19:56,780 --> 00:19:59,039
adding your new application is really

449
00:19:59,039 --> 00:20:02,700
easy uh you can amplify your uh

450
00:20:02,700 --> 00:20:05,039
amplifier and simplify your application

451
00:20:05,039 --> 00:20:08,820
updates also so also it reduces the cost

452
00:20:08,820 --> 00:20:10,919
by the multi-tenant proxy so

453
00:20:10,919 --> 00:20:12,600
multi-tenant is one of the things you

454
00:20:12,600 --> 00:20:14,940
need to explore more on the side in the

455
00:20:14,940 --> 00:20:18,059
future we can add the ebpf for sure in

456
00:20:18,059 --> 00:20:21,360
this thing like it is talking about the

457
00:20:21,360 --> 00:20:23,100
ambient mesh it is not yet production

458
00:20:23,100 --> 00:20:25,860
ready it will available I guess till the

459
00:20:25,860 --> 00:20:28,080
February or March but you can explore

460
00:20:28,080 --> 00:20:30,419
this is the best time to explore the

461
00:20:30,419 --> 00:20:33,059
technology and if you are a student also

462
00:20:33,059 --> 00:20:35,460
early beginner you can contribute to it

463
00:20:35,460 --> 00:20:38,340
and you will get really a nice open

464
00:20:38,340 --> 00:20:42,678
source insights so what's next

465
00:20:46,700 --> 00:20:49,679
and if you want to learn more on the HTM

466
00:20:49,679 --> 00:20:52,020
band mesh you can screenshot it and you

467
00:20:52,020 --> 00:20:54,179
can go on this resources learn about the

468
00:20:54,179 --> 00:20:54,900
same

469
00:20:54,900 --> 00:20:57,240
we have awesome resources and solo

470
00:20:57,240 --> 00:21:00,000
Academy is the one to plan on this hi so

471
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:02,900
thank you for listening

472
00:21:03,120 --> 00:21:05,340
thank you so much for that Robert that

473
00:21:05,340 --> 00:21:06,179
was really really good I know I know

474
00:21:06,179 --> 00:21:08,460
it's like a hard topic to cover in 15

475
00:21:08,460 --> 00:21:11,640
minutes like istio yeah container and

476
00:21:11,640 --> 00:21:13,559
kubernetes I think it's as you said I

477
00:21:13,559 --> 00:21:15,480
think I really like to advise go slowly

478
00:21:15,480 --> 00:21:17,160
because I think that's one of the things

479
00:21:17,160 --> 00:21:19,200
kubernetes has become so popular and

480
00:21:19,200 --> 00:21:20,880
everyone wants to implement it but it is

481
00:21:20,880 --> 00:21:23,520
definitely not an easy technology

482
00:21:23,520 --> 00:21:25,320
um to sort of do that as well so it's

483
00:21:25,320 --> 00:21:27,179
quite quite hard but no thank you so

484
00:21:27,179 --> 00:21:29,340
much for that and coming on devsecond if

485
00:21:29,340 --> 00:21:30,780
anyone does have any questions I think

486
00:21:30,780 --> 00:21:33,299
Robert did share his social so do feel

487
00:21:33,299 --> 00:21:35,039
free to Ping him and I I think it sounds

488
00:21:35,039 --> 00:21:36,900
like you know he's knee-deep into istio

489
00:21:36,900 --> 00:21:39,179
so he will have a lot of good

490
00:21:39,179 --> 00:21:41,539
information for you thank you so much

491
00:21:41,539 --> 00:21:45,919
and I'll just push you to the backstage
