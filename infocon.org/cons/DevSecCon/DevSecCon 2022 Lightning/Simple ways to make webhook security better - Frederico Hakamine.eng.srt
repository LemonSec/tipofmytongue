1
00:00:00,480 --> 00:00:03,360
yeah I definitely do so um

2
00:00:03,360 --> 00:00:07,559
next up we have Frederico hakamani and

3
00:00:07,560 --> 00:00:11,940
uh he is a Brazilian a pomerency an

4
00:00:11,940 --> 00:00:14,940
engrocker fan of good software Legos

5
00:00:14,940 --> 00:00:16,800
he's a brewmaster

6
00:00:16,800 --> 00:00:19,500
and he is I can confirm a jack of all

7
00:00:19,500 --> 00:00:22,140
trades but I refuse to say the part of

8
00:00:22,140 --> 00:00:24,300
his bio that he put forward which is

9
00:00:24,300 --> 00:00:26,400
master of none he's mastered a lot of

10
00:00:26,400 --> 00:00:28,199
things and

11
00:00:28,199 --> 00:00:30,480
um I'm really glad that he's gonna speak

12
00:00:30,480 --> 00:00:32,340
for us here today

13
00:00:32,340 --> 00:00:35,640
um he and I work together at OCTA and uh

14
00:00:35,640 --> 00:00:37,500
we we've talked at various conferences

15
00:00:37,500 --> 00:00:39,660
and he's an all-around great guy in

16
00:00:39,660 --> 00:00:40,800
addition to being an amazing

17
00:00:40,800 --> 00:00:43,020
technologist and we were we were having

18
00:00:43,020 --> 00:00:46,620
fun with ngrap before before he went and

19
00:00:46,620 --> 00:00:48,840
went to work for engrock so it's cool to

20
00:00:48,840 --> 00:00:51,000
see you there now too Frederica

21
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:53,640
Let's uh let's bring him in

22
00:00:53,640 --> 00:00:56,640
there he is hi folks

23
00:00:56,640 --> 00:00:59,219
good morning good evening I don't I

be here so happy to see pretty familiar

27
00:01:05,040 --> 00:01:07,380
face uh thanks for the intro man man

28
00:01:07,380 --> 00:01:09,020
yeah

29
00:01:09,020 --> 00:01:12,420
I I tried to measures up by creeping to

30
00:01:12,420 --> 00:01:13,439
some things

31
00:01:13,439 --> 00:01:16,380
um I'm here to talk about one of these

32
00:01:16,380 --> 00:01:19,200
we're not tripping acting yet

33
00:01:19,200 --> 00:01:23,400
it's web hooks it's it's so fun so hope

34
00:01:23,400 --> 00:01:25,560
you guys can see my screen

35
00:01:25,560 --> 00:01:29,340
not yet not yet you need to share your

36
00:01:29,340 --> 00:01:31,020
screen and then we can add it to the

37
00:01:31,020 --> 00:01:32,580
stream we're also getting a little bit

38
00:01:32,580 --> 00:01:34,020
of echo

39
00:01:34,020 --> 00:01:36,600
oh oh I'm getting it cool let's see if

40
00:01:36,600 --> 00:01:37,920
it gets better now

41
00:01:37,920 --> 00:01:39,540
uh

42
00:01:39,540 --> 00:01:42,000
is it better now there we go

43
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:43,920
okay

44
00:01:43,920 --> 00:01:46,619
audience right so shall we uh kick it

45
00:01:46,619 --> 00:01:48,540
off you ready to go

46
00:01:48,540 --> 00:01:52,140
yeah all right all right there we go

47
00:01:52,140 --> 00:01:54,780
okay thank you thank you guys thanks for

48
00:01:54,780 --> 00:01:56,460
being here I'm here to talk about to

49
00:01:56,460 --> 00:01:59,159
talk about ways to make security better

50
00:01:59,159 --> 00:02:02,700
my name is Fred again I work at ingrock

51
00:02:02,700 --> 00:02:05,219
um and I'm here to touch to touch three

52
00:02:05,219 --> 00:02:07,259
things first just quick recap of web

53
00:02:07,259 --> 00:02:10,440
hooks him security sites so there are

54
00:02:10,440 --> 00:02:12,840
some things on the architecture that

55
00:02:12,840 --> 00:02:16,260
that when it comes to security

56
00:02:16,260 --> 00:02:19,860
second I show you some of the finds oh

57
00:02:19,860 --> 00:02:22,140
I'm getting some Reverb

58
00:02:22,140 --> 00:02:22,980
um

59
00:02:22,980 --> 00:02:25,140
let's see

60
00:02:25,140 --> 00:02:27,420
let me switch to the built-in mic yeah

61
00:02:27,420 --> 00:02:29,459
it could be everyone though

62
00:02:29,459 --> 00:02:31,220
okay

63
00:02:31,220 --> 00:02:33,840
just you know a little little visit from

64
00:02:33,840 --> 00:02:36,780
the demo monster it happens oh yeah uh

65
00:02:36,780 --> 00:02:39,000
it happens to me all the time

66
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:42,300
is this better

67
00:02:42,300 --> 00:02:45,000
I think it is better okay cool wow

68
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:47,879
looked off his weeny wire today

69
00:02:47,879 --> 00:02:51,780
um okay so continuing with where we were

70
00:02:51,780 --> 00:02:53,280
um my goal is to go through three things

71
00:02:53,280 --> 00:02:55,500
specific recap of web books more from

72
00:02:55,500 --> 00:02:58,019
the security side show you some findings

73
00:02:58,019 --> 00:02:59,879
of a research we did with over 100

74
00:02:59,879 --> 00:03:02,700
different web hook implementations in

75
00:03:02,700 --> 00:03:04,800
talk about things you can do to make

76
00:03:04,800 --> 00:03:06,840
webhook security better whether you are

77
00:03:06,840 --> 00:03:08,819
a listener in your consuming those

78
00:03:08,819 --> 00:03:11,459
whether you are serving others with that

79
00:03:11,459 --> 00:03:14,280
in with that together in the third eye

80
00:03:14,280 --> 00:03:16,739
pin actually give you some action or

81
00:03:16,739 --> 00:03:18,780
give you some things to do to help the

82
00:03:18,780 --> 00:03:20,400
community make better web hook security

83
00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:23,599
so let's get going

84
00:03:24,840 --> 00:03:26,280
um this is a quick presentation I'm

85
00:03:26,280 --> 00:03:27,420
going to share this link with you later

86
00:03:27,420 --> 00:03:30,120
so you can have access to the Dax

87
00:03:30,120 --> 00:03:30,840
um

88
00:03:30,840 --> 00:03:33,420
as webhooks starting with a quick intro

89
00:03:33,420 --> 00:03:35,580
many people already are familiar with

90
00:03:35,580 --> 00:03:37,440
web hooks because if you see them you

91
00:03:37,440 --> 00:03:39,780
love them right web hooks are one of the

92
00:03:39,780 --> 00:03:41,760
best scenes ever most important things

93
00:03:41,760 --> 00:03:44,580
uh it allows you to build applications

94
00:03:44,580 --> 00:03:47,340
that react to events so instead of let's

95
00:03:47,340 --> 00:03:49,379
say to a traditional API if you're

96
00:03:49,379 --> 00:03:51,900
integrating with video go the next video

97
00:03:51,900 --> 00:03:53,640
all the time hey if you have a new

98
00:03:53,640 --> 00:03:57,360
message I can work on just send an URL

99
00:03:57,360 --> 00:03:59,879
to Twitter say tell me when it happens

100
00:03:59,879 --> 00:04:01,440
instead of me calling you all the time

101
00:04:01,440 --> 00:04:04,019
until it sends you that it's great for

102
00:04:04,019 --> 00:04:05,580
twilio it's great for you because

103
00:04:05,580 --> 00:04:07,980
there's no overhead there there isn't a

104
00:04:07,980 --> 00:04:09,659
bunch of calls going on

105
00:04:09,659 --> 00:04:11,760
however that changes the game a little

106
00:04:11,760 --> 00:04:13,680
bit in terms of security

107
00:04:13,680 --> 00:04:15,480
the first thing is that most of the

108
00:04:15,480 --> 00:04:17,519
security responsibilities that would

109
00:04:17,519 --> 00:04:20,459
typically go with the two idios side of

110
00:04:20,459 --> 00:04:22,740
things let's say the provider it goes to

111
00:04:22,740 --> 00:04:25,919
the consumer so in a pulling strategy

112
00:04:25,919 --> 00:04:28,440
Twitter is checking your authentication

113
00:04:28,440 --> 00:04:30,960
for Keys it's checking your offs they

114
00:04:30,960 --> 00:04:33,120
implement the dolls and all bunch of

115
00:04:33,120 --> 00:04:35,520
things whereas on the web hooks that

116
00:04:35,520 --> 00:04:37,740
responsibility most of the times relies

117
00:04:37,740 --> 00:04:39,540
on the listener's side

118
00:04:39,540 --> 00:04:42,180
and the second thing is that related to

119
00:04:42,180 --> 00:04:43,199
this

120
00:04:43,199 --> 00:04:45,180
that you don't necessarily need to do

121
00:04:45,180 --> 00:04:47,780
all the security stuff in order to be

122
00:04:47,780 --> 00:04:51,060
successful or functional if you will so

123
00:04:51,060 --> 00:04:54,180
this is me creating a something to do

124
00:04:54,180 --> 00:04:56,940
crazy stuff with my CD if I get a web

125
00:04:56,940 --> 00:04:59,639
hook notification from GitHub and

126
00:04:59,639 --> 00:05:01,680
because I'm a lazy developer I didn't do

127
00:05:01,680 --> 00:05:03,120
a bunch of stuff on security there's

128
00:05:03,120 --> 00:05:05,759
just a to-do for YouTube and that's

129
00:05:05,759 --> 00:05:07,979
actually uh bad in terms of security and

130
00:05:07,979 --> 00:05:10,620
not even doing Authentication

131
00:05:10,620 --> 00:05:13,320
the these ones are fairly know if you're

132
00:05:13,320 --> 00:05:15,120
familiar with web hooks but there's a

133
00:05:15,120 --> 00:05:16,259
third caveat

134
00:05:16,259 --> 00:05:18,479
there are so many different ways to

135
00:05:18,479 --> 00:05:21,720
secure web Hooks and it's so easy to

136
00:05:21,720 --> 00:05:23,820
ignore that because when you think of

137
00:05:23,820 --> 00:05:27,440
web hooks you think of simplicity

138
00:05:27,479 --> 00:05:29,940
uh so at engrock my current gig we

139
00:05:29,940 --> 00:05:31,500
started implementing webhook

140
00:05:31,500 --> 00:05:33,419
Integrations for service we're doing

141
00:05:33,419 --> 00:05:37,440
over there uh module and the first time

142
00:05:37,440 --> 00:05:39,960
we started scoping for this work we were

143
00:05:39,960 --> 00:05:41,639
like yeah it's going to be simple we're

144
00:05:41,639 --> 00:05:43,440
going to do a bunch of deals but after

145
00:05:43,440 --> 00:05:46,199
going through many different of those as

146
00:05:46,199 --> 00:05:48,539
a responsible developer we started

147
00:05:48,539 --> 00:05:50,940
seeing some differences that makes work

148
00:05:50,940 --> 00:05:54,120
make work for us a little bit harder uh

149
00:05:54,120 --> 00:05:57,360
and it liked about in our heads so the

150
00:05:57,360 --> 00:05:58,800
first thing is that when starting

151
00:05:58,800 --> 00:06:00,900
implementing security for web hooks

152
00:06:00,900 --> 00:06:03,120
seven out of 10 web books will present

153
00:06:03,120 --> 00:06:06,120
some differences even with most web

154
00:06:06,120 --> 00:06:09,900
hooks using uh hmac signatures so you

155
00:06:09,900 --> 00:06:11,940
signed a body you send it over and use

156
00:06:11,940 --> 00:06:13,259
that there's a way of doing

157
00:06:13,259 --> 00:06:15,360
authentication and message Integrity

158
00:06:15,360 --> 00:06:18,660
many do in different ways so half we use

159
00:06:18,660 --> 00:06:21,120
we're doing coding with base64 the other

160
00:06:21,120 --> 00:06:24,300
half with text they will they will hash

161
00:06:24,300 --> 00:06:26,340
different parts of the message it goes

162
00:06:26,340 --> 00:06:27,360
all over

163
00:06:27,360 --> 00:06:30,900
and only a few percentage of web books

164
00:06:30,900 --> 00:06:33,300
will Implement more controls which you

165
00:06:33,300 --> 00:06:35,280
should be leveraging as a listener so it

166
00:06:35,280 --> 00:06:37,860
gets very hard to do it right

167
00:06:37,860 --> 00:06:40,199
and as a responsible developer as well

168
00:06:40,199 --> 00:06:44,460
because uh security do not necessarily

169
00:06:44,460 --> 00:06:46,919
stand in between the success and getting

170
00:06:46,919 --> 00:06:49,919
that web hook call done done uh you end

171
00:06:49,919 --> 00:06:52,560
up having to read a bunch more docs and

172
00:06:52,560 --> 00:06:54,660
have to build a much more than just like

173
00:06:54,660 --> 00:06:56,699
getting that get started and run with it

174
00:06:56,699 --> 00:06:59,460
so the getting started will just get you

175
00:06:59,460 --> 00:07:01,860
to understand the webhook message but

176
00:07:01,860 --> 00:07:04,919
adding security around that in a right

177
00:07:04,919 --> 00:07:07,139
way requires you to go through a bunch

178
00:07:07,139 --> 00:07:08,940
of different documentations and explore

179
00:07:08,940 --> 00:07:11,100
how that thing would work

180
00:07:11,100 --> 00:07:13,340
foreign

181
00:07:13,759 --> 00:07:16,259
nice thank you for showing you all the

182
00:07:16,259 --> 00:07:17,580
problems we have in the world what we

183
00:07:17,580 --> 00:07:19,800
can do to fix this

184
00:07:19,800 --> 00:07:22,440
so the best way we can see we could

185
00:07:22,440 --> 00:07:24,060
think about when we tackle this problem

186
00:07:24,060 --> 00:07:25,740
we would look at that we started

187
00:07:25,740 --> 00:07:27,900
actually cataloging those scenes as we

188
00:07:27,900 --> 00:07:29,940
were implementing the Integrations

189
00:07:29,940 --> 00:07:33,000
ourselves we thought that why we cannot

190
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:34,680
change the world we can make it a little

191
00:07:34,680 --> 00:07:37,319
bit better to help people spot the

192
00:07:37,319 --> 00:07:38,819
parents and see how good looks like

193
00:07:38,819 --> 00:07:42,360
that's in a website called webbooks.fyi

194
00:07:42,360 --> 00:07:43,860
that you can go and check it out

195
00:07:43,860 --> 00:07:46,020
yourself I'm gonna go through some of

196
00:07:46,020 --> 00:07:48,840
the findings we got from this place and

197
00:07:48,840 --> 00:07:51,180
share some easy ways and strategies you

198
00:07:51,180 --> 00:07:53,580
can do better web hook as a listener or

199
00:07:53,580 --> 00:07:57,680
as a consumer or as a society

200
00:07:58,280 --> 00:08:01,560
starting with the providers so if you

201
00:08:01,560 --> 00:08:03,960
are a set service or if you are creating

202
00:08:03,960 --> 00:08:05,880
your service and you want to send web

203
00:08:05,880 --> 00:08:07,919
books to people these are some of the

204
00:08:07,919 --> 00:08:10,440
things you can do that are very easy to

205
00:08:10,440 --> 00:08:13,680
do uh in general and that will help

206
00:08:13,680 --> 00:08:15,840
people a lot providing amazing

207
00:08:15,840 --> 00:08:17,880
documentations but obvious always good

208
00:08:17,880 --> 00:08:20,460
Implement security when you send a

209
00:08:20,460 --> 00:08:22,800
message as well don't treat that just as

210
00:08:22,800 --> 00:08:24,539
a responsibility to The Listener data

211
00:08:24,539 --> 00:08:26,819
feeds you can do in this front improve

212
00:08:26,819 --> 00:08:28,979
secret Keys strong encryption and

213
00:08:28,979 --> 00:08:31,800
hashing signature payload leverage the

214
00:08:31,800 --> 00:08:34,320
payload and signature not only for body

215
00:08:34,320 --> 00:08:37,140
but others implementary plate prevention

216
00:08:37,140 --> 00:08:40,380
versioning compensatory controls uh the

217
00:08:40,380 --> 00:08:42,360
listing is like a shopping list like how

218
00:08:42,360 --> 00:08:45,360
do I do this how do I get this right uh

219
00:08:45,360 --> 00:08:47,040
the suggestion here is to copy from the

220
00:08:47,040 --> 00:08:48,420
grades

221
00:08:48,420 --> 00:08:50,519
um there are many great patterns

222
00:08:50,519 --> 00:08:52,260
implemented throughout the industry not

223
00:08:52,260 --> 00:08:55,019
necessarily consistently but when you go

224
00:08:55,019 --> 00:08:57,540
through those things let's say webhook

225
00:08:57,540 --> 00:08:59,459
security and you see things like how do

226
00:08:59,459 --> 00:09:01,440
I do one-time verification on how do I

227
00:09:01,440 --> 00:09:03,779
build amazing documentation you can go

228
00:09:03,779 --> 00:09:06,360
through web hooks FYI and see what you

229
00:09:06,360 --> 00:09:08,519
need to do or what are the grades to

230
00:09:08,519 --> 00:09:11,640
copy from great example of that square

231
00:09:11,640 --> 00:09:15,120
would tell you how to which events you

232
00:09:15,120 --> 00:09:17,220
can listen to how you should subscribe

233
00:09:17,220 --> 00:09:20,339
to events or stripe does a great job

234
00:09:20,339 --> 00:09:23,100
with telling you how to retry a web Hook

235
00:09:23,100 --> 00:09:24,500
when something doesn't go right

236
00:09:24,500 --> 00:09:27,540
insecurely copy the grades you should be

237
00:09:27,540 --> 00:09:29,880
good on that front use this as a catalog

238
00:09:29,880 --> 00:09:31,820
please

239
00:09:31,820 --> 00:09:34,560
as a listener these are some of the best

240
00:09:34,560 --> 00:09:36,839
practices you can do

241
00:09:36,839 --> 00:09:38,640
um you say yes

242
00:09:38,640 --> 00:09:41,160
ensure you you are actually leveraging

243
00:09:41,160 --> 00:09:43,080
security rather than just putting the

244
00:09:43,080 --> 00:09:45,800
to-do like I did with my node.js app

245
00:09:45,800 --> 00:09:48,600
restrict access my ID storing secret

246
00:09:48,600 --> 00:09:50,760
segmenting rotating using robust

247
00:09:50,760 --> 00:09:53,279
algorithms calling back the service if

248
00:09:53,279 --> 00:09:55,320
you're not sure and one thing you will

249
00:09:55,320 --> 00:09:57,420
notice is that many of these spanners

250
00:09:57,420 --> 00:09:59,580
are the sync patterns you're using When

251
00:09:59,580 --> 00:10:03,959
developing safe web apps or apis so if

252
00:10:03,959 --> 00:10:06,420
you pay attention very well to those

253
00:10:06,420 --> 00:10:08,580
endpoints you're providing you should

254
00:10:08,580 --> 00:10:10,980
have that same level of attention to how

255
00:10:10,980 --> 00:10:13,880
you listen to the world

256
00:10:15,080 --> 00:10:17,100
there are some things as an industry

257
00:10:17,100 --> 00:10:19,380
that's a little bit hard to do but see

258
00:10:19,380 --> 00:10:22,140
it's important to do so there are some

259
00:10:22,140 --> 00:10:24,660
standards uh you're seeing some of the

260
00:10:24,660 --> 00:10:27,060
most popular ones here uh you can see

261
00:10:27,060 --> 00:10:30,300
the ietf HTTP message signatures which

262
00:10:30,300 --> 00:10:32,779
is very promising so they're trying to

263
00:10:32,779 --> 00:10:35,459
uh create a spec for signing entity

264
00:10:35,459 --> 00:10:38,100
messages because

265
00:10:38,100 --> 00:10:40,440
ATP message signature is the most

266
00:10:40,440 --> 00:10:42,480
popular authentication mechanism in web

267
00:10:42,480 --> 00:10:45,180
books it will certainly influence uh the

268
00:10:45,180 --> 00:10:46,260
whole industry in the right direction

269
00:10:46,260 --> 00:10:48,600
same goes with Cloud events they are

270
00:10:48,600 --> 00:10:50,519
both trying to do the same thing so one

271
00:10:50,519 --> 00:10:52,860
is ietf the other one is by the cloud

272
00:10:52,860 --> 00:10:55,019
native Foundation

273
00:10:55,019 --> 00:10:56,760
um also there are other fees specific to

274
00:10:56,760 --> 00:10:58,800
security like the open ID share signals

275
00:10:58,800 --> 00:11:01,019
and secrets and the rest hooks it's an

276
00:11:01,019 --> 00:11:03,420
initiative from that year uh this is

277
00:11:03,420 --> 00:11:05,220
something that's going on here

278
00:11:05,220 --> 00:11:07,500
because there are many standards there

279
00:11:07,500 --> 00:11:11,160
is a let's say a arms race here to see

280
00:11:11,160 --> 00:11:13,079
who's gonna win or who's gonna be the

281
00:11:13,079 --> 00:11:15,540
most prevalent one uh as an individual

282
00:11:15,540 --> 00:11:17,640
you can contribute to some of those or

283
00:11:17,640 --> 00:11:20,279
you can actually help build awareness

284
00:11:20,279 --> 00:11:22,820
yourself

285
00:11:23,399 --> 00:11:25,680
here are some of the ways to to help out

286
00:11:25,680 --> 00:11:27,779
the the industry

287
00:11:27,779 --> 00:11:29,640
um

288
00:11:29,640 --> 00:11:32,220
everybody that develops a web hook or

289
00:11:32,220 --> 00:11:35,040
consumes a web hook uh is in a unique

290
00:11:35,040 --> 00:11:36,240
position if you're a responsible

291
00:11:36,240 --> 00:11:38,399
developer you will need to do some of

292
00:11:38,399 --> 00:11:40,200
those things we talked about right you

293
00:11:40,200 --> 00:11:41,820
would need to parse the documentation

294
00:11:41,820 --> 00:11:43,980
figure out the things that needs to be

295
00:11:43,980 --> 00:11:46,800
used and how to use them so if you're in

296
00:11:46,800 --> 00:11:48,540
the middle of doing that go to the

297
00:11:48,540 --> 00:11:50,519
places where these things are being

298
00:11:50,519 --> 00:11:52,740
cataloged and tell the world about it it

299
00:11:52,740 --> 00:11:55,140
could be both in web hooks FYI and also

300
00:11:55,140 --> 00:11:58,500
the awesome web list from RE real adult

301
00:11:58,500 --> 00:12:01,620
that's really really good actually we we

302
00:12:01,620 --> 00:12:03,959
recommend that as well it's a great

303
00:12:03,959 --> 00:12:06,660
place and if you're a provider follow

304
00:12:06,660 --> 00:12:09,839
the good patterns uh see what good looks

305
00:12:09,839 --> 00:12:12,300
like from other providers and also list

306
00:12:12,300 --> 00:12:15,600
your provider uh so proud that you're

307
00:12:15,600 --> 00:12:17,100
there

308
00:12:17,100 --> 00:12:20,220
um this is my call for you to action uh

309
00:12:20,220 --> 00:12:23,579
go and figure out help us out I'm here

310
00:12:23,579 --> 00:12:25,260
to answer any questions you have about

311
00:12:25,260 --> 00:12:28,440
webhook security I can go into some of

312
00:12:28,440 --> 00:12:30,540
these deep items for you tell some of

313
00:12:30,540 --> 00:12:32,519
our findings we have that in a blog as

314
00:12:32,519 --> 00:12:35,040
well that I'm gonna share uh we walk

315
00:12:35,040 --> 00:12:37,320
through all the different patterns all

316
00:12:37,320 --> 00:12:38,459
the things that are right the things

317
00:12:38,459 --> 00:12:40,920
that are actually kind of scary and even

318
00:12:40,920 --> 00:12:43,920
uh frustrating about the experience

319
00:12:43,920 --> 00:12:46,980
uh with that oh that's it back for

320
00:12:46,980 --> 00:12:49,220
questions

321
00:12:50,459 --> 00:12:53,459
foreign

322
00:12:57,260 --> 00:13:00,660
I dropped in a quick question would you

323
00:13:00,660 --> 00:13:02,339
say on the slide where you were showing

324
00:13:02,339 --> 00:13:03,540
the various

325
00:13:03,540 --> 00:13:06,540
standards like open ID and HD would you

326
00:13:06,540 --> 00:13:08,040
say any one of them is ahead of any

327
00:13:08,040 --> 00:13:10,320
other at this point like is one kind of

328
00:13:10,320 --> 00:13:12,180
emerging as a leader

329
00:13:12,180 --> 00:13:16,260
I many of those right now they are on on

330
00:13:16,260 --> 00:13:19,740
the draft specs and they are on on like

331
00:13:19,740 --> 00:13:22,200
open for comments they really like the

332
00:13:22,200 --> 00:13:25,500
ITF message signature

333
00:13:25,500 --> 00:13:29,100
and uh Cloud event it's it's hard to

334
00:13:29,100 --> 00:13:30,779
pick a fake one they they're very good

335
00:13:30,779 --> 00:13:32,940
they're doing scenes that are very hard

336
00:13:32,940 --> 00:13:34,500
to do

337
00:13:34,500 --> 00:13:36,480
um I'll give you a good example so Cloud

338
00:13:36,480 --> 00:13:38,639
events they they are very opinionated

339
00:13:38,639 --> 00:13:39,839
about

340
00:13:39,839 --> 00:13:42,420
uh including your payload and signature

341
00:13:42,420 --> 00:13:43,620
the header

342
00:13:43,620 --> 00:13:47,220
in a certain kind of header so uh let's

343
00:13:47,220 --> 00:13:50,760
say you're making a a web hook call like

344
00:13:50,760 --> 00:13:53,040
the message tells you some information

345
00:13:53,040 --> 00:13:55,800
that you should be taken forward but the

346
00:13:55,800 --> 00:13:58,200
header might tell that many times great

347
00:13:58,200 --> 00:14:00,180
example is a time stamp so headers

348
00:14:00,180 --> 00:14:02,459
typically carry a timestamp to to

349
00:14:02,459 --> 00:14:04,680
prevent replay attacks

350
00:14:04,680 --> 00:14:06,899
Cloud event is very opinionated about

351
00:14:06,899 --> 00:14:10,500
the timestamp it says it should be Unix

352
00:14:10,500 --> 00:14:13,200
uh so that like takes a lot of

353
00:14:13,200 --> 00:14:15,540
hesitation on how it should do and you

354
00:14:15,540 --> 00:14:18,060
should uh include these headers as part

355
00:14:18,060 --> 00:14:19,380
of your signature and then there's

356
00:14:19,380 --> 00:14:21,540
versiony as well so I really like their

357
00:14:21,540 --> 00:14:25,079
work over there uh I'm not saying ITF is

358
00:14:25,079 --> 00:14:28,200
not doing a great job as well uh so it's

359
00:14:28,200 --> 00:14:30,600
it's an arms race it's great for the

360
00:14:30,600 --> 00:14:32,959
industry

361
00:14:34,579 --> 00:14:36,959
thank you I've been using web hooks for

362
00:14:36,959 --> 00:14:38,760
a long time and I've seen just in terms

363
00:14:38,760 --> 00:14:40,139
of like security patterns over the years

364
00:14:40,139 --> 00:14:41,899
things have sort of shifted I remember

365
00:14:41,899 --> 00:14:44,339
originally when web hooks were first

366
00:14:44,339 --> 00:14:45,959
sort of gaining popularity there was no

367
00:14:45,959 --> 00:14:48,540
concept of validating a request or

368
00:14:48,540 --> 00:14:50,459
figuring out who sent it

369
00:14:50,459 --> 00:14:51,720
um I think eventually people sort of

370
00:14:51,720 --> 00:14:53,880
move to like having a shared key sort of

371
00:14:53,880 --> 00:14:55,139
model

372
00:14:55,139 --> 00:14:56,940
um do you think like what do you think

373
00:14:56,940 --> 00:14:58,680
is happening in terms of the security

374
00:14:58,680 --> 00:15:00,839
side of web hooks just in the future

375
00:15:00,839 --> 00:15:02,459
given all the changes that have been

376
00:15:02,459 --> 00:15:04,800
happening in the last handful of years

377
00:15:04,800 --> 00:15:06,240
yeah

378
00:15:06,240 --> 00:15:08,399
um web hooks they they are a very

379
00:15:08,399 --> 00:15:10,740
interesting space because like the

380
00:15:10,740 --> 00:15:12,600
mission number one two and three is

381
00:15:12,600 --> 00:15:15,360
building for Simplicity which I I

382
00:15:15,360 --> 00:15:18,420
Honestly Love uh but it also makes

383
00:15:18,420 --> 00:15:21,899
security challenging at some time so I

384
00:15:21,899 --> 00:15:25,079
see hashing hashes it still has a great

385
00:15:25,079 --> 00:15:27,360
way of doing that some some

386
00:15:27,360 --> 00:15:30,540
implementations are trying to add uh

387
00:15:30,540 --> 00:15:33,060
oauth you know trying to add inside that

388
00:15:33,060 --> 00:15:36,839
that that's amazing at one place because

389
00:15:36,839 --> 00:15:40,440
if you use let's say jokes uh it's great

390
00:15:40,440 --> 00:15:42,839
because there's key rotation happens

391
00:15:42,839 --> 00:15:45,240
automatically but or else it's hard to

392
00:15:45,240 --> 00:15:47,880
implement so

393
00:15:47,880 --> 00:15:50,220
um what you're seeing in the marketplace

394
00:15:50,220 --> 00:15:52,980
these days is like

395
00:15:52,980 --> 00:15:56,220
hashing of more things in things that

396
00:15:56,220 --> 00:15:58,680
add additional security

397
00:15:58,680 --> 00:16:01,800
so timestamps is an example version is

398
00:16:01,800 --> 00:16:03,779
another one

399
00:16:03,779 --> 00:16:04,500
um

400
00:16:04,500 --> 00:16:06,300
there are many many interesting

401
00:16:06,300 --> 00:16:08,220
implementations out there there are some

402
00:16:08,220 --> 00:16:11,820
people also using just the jwk parts to

403
00:16:11,820 --> 00:16:14,820
distribute Keys that's really sweet and

404
00:16:14,820 --> 00:16:19,019
interesting uh yeah but there is still a

405
00:16:19,019 --> 00:16:21,060
lot of things using basic authentication

406
00:16:21,060 --> 00:16:23,459
out there uh I believe in our research

407
00:16:23,459 --> 00:16:25,500
we found 15 percent of implementations

408
00:16:25,500 --> 00:16:28,079
using it a bunch of implementations

409
00:16:28,079 --> 00:16:30,899
using xiaowan and hash signatures that's

410
00:16:30,899 --> 00:16:32,220
kind of scary

411
00:16:32,220 --> 00:16:33,899
I actually have a couple Production

412
00:16:33,899 --> 00:16:35,760
Services I run as hobby projects which

413
00:16:35,760 --> 00:16:37,980
are still using basic off for a variety

414
00:16:37,980 --> 00:16:41,220
of these things yeah

415
00:16:41,220 --> 00:16:41,880
um

416
00:16:41,880 --> 00:16:43,440
yes

417
00:16:43,440 --> 00:16:46,500
um compensatory controls

418
00:16:46,500 --> 00:16:48,959
share those with us live right now yeah

419
00:16:48,959 --> 00:16:50,600
let's share right now

420
00:16:50,600 --> 00:16:55,620
don't think so I I don't wanna I I don't

421
00:16:55,620 --> 00:16:57,180
want to tell which ones but I can tell

422
00:16:57,180 --> 00:17:00,000
where to look at uh there's a web hook

423
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:03,300
directory in webhooks.fyi and you can

424
00:17:03,300 --> 00:17:06,359
look at the signing algorithm using use

425
00:17:06,359 --> 00:17:08,459
by own some of those and the security

426
00:17:08,459 --> 00:17:11,760
controls they're implementing or not

427
00:17:11,760 --> 00:17:14,400
um while this should be used for good uh

428
00:17:14,400 --> 00:17:16,020
it can also provide you some information

429
00:17:16,020 --> 00:17:20,299
of things that need to step up

430
00:17:22,140 --> 00:17:24,720
ouch awesome well do we have any

431
00:17:24,720 --> 00:17:26,880
additional question or if you have any

432
00:17:26,880 --> 00:17:28,559
additional questions for Frederico

433
00:17:28,559 --> 00:17:29,940
please drop them in the chat right now

434
00:17:29,940 --> 00:17:33,480
before we pull in our next speaker

435
00:17:33,480 --> 00:17:36,179
um I also did see someone suggested uh

436
00:17:36,179 --> 00:17:39,000
people check out this uh awesome web

437
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:41,160
hooks repository on GitHub so thank you

438
00:17:41,160 --> 00:17:44,160
for sharing that and um yeah if there's

439
00:17:44,160 --> 00:17:45,720
anything else you want to plug Frederico

440
00:17:45,720 --> 00:17:47,160
are there any cool projects you think

441
00:17:47,160 --> 00:17:49,559
people should check out or blogs they

442
00:17:49,559 --> 00:17:51,539
should read or people they should follow

443
00:17:51,539 --> 00:17:53,400
on Twitter this is your chance to uh get

444
00:17:53,400 --> 00:17:56,520
the plug out there yeah uh awesome web

445
00:17:56,520 --> 00:18:00,240
books is is a great place to go for uh

446
00:18:00,240 --> 00:18:02,700
we draw we we got a lot of inspiration

447
00:18:02,700 --> 00:18:04,140
from there

448
00:18:04,140 --> 00:18:08,280
um as for the great examples uh I really

449
00:18:08,280 --> 00:18:10,280
like what

450
00:18:10,280 --> 00:18:13,020
strike is doing Zoom came up with a

451
00:18:13,020 --> 00:18:14,760
brand new web hook implementation that's

452
00:18:14,760 --> 00:18:17,520
very elegant as well uh and there are a

453
00:18:17,520 --> 00:18:21,179
lot of great people catching up fast so

454
00:18:21,179 --> 00:18:23,580
um spot is doing a great job with

455
00:18:23,580 --> 00:18:27,059
versioning these are some like examples

456
00:18:27,059 --> 00:18:28,980
I wish I could point that one example

457
00:18:28,980 --> 00:18:31,140
and say like follow this company they're

458
00:18:31,140 --> 00:18:33,299
doing amazing work but unfortunately

459
00:18:33,299 --> 00:18:36,059
that doesn't exist today which goes to

460
00:18:36,059 --> 00:18:37,799
show that we have a lot to do with about

461
00:18:37,799 --> 00:18:41,280
hooks in terms of security but

462
00:18:41,280 --> 00:18:43,980
um those are some of the cool things I

463
00:18:43,980 --> 00:18:46,860
can point you towards

464
00:18:46,860 --> 00:18:48,120
awesome

465
00:18:48,120 --> 00:18:49,919
well thank you so much for coming by
