1
00:00:00,599 --> 00:00:03,959
all right next up we have uh we're gonna

2
00:00:03,959 --> 00:00:05,520
be talking about security incidents for

3
00:00:05,520 --> 00:00:09,120
devops and presenting that is Tanya who

4
00:00:09,120 --> 00:00:10,920
is the CEO and founder at we hack purple

5
00:00:10,920 --> 00:00:12,900
but I'll allow Tanya to come on and

6
00:00:12,900 --> 00:00:14,219
introduce herself because I know she

7
00:00:14,219 --> 00:00:16,500
mentioned she has some fun way of doing

8
00:00:16,500 --> 00:00:19,759
that so take it away Tanya

9
00:00:23,580 --> 00:00:26,460
we're all set awesome

10
00:00:26,460 --> 00:00:28,199
but talk about incident response today

11
00:00:28,199 --> 00:00:30,539
and so I'm Tanya I'm also known as

12
00:00:30,539 --> 00:00:33,360
shiak's Purple but basically I'm pretty

13
00:00:33,360 --> 00:00:36,059
much obsessed with application security

14
00:00:36,059 --> 00:00:39,300
when you do appsec you end up

15
00:00:39,300 --> 00:00:42,120
doing incident response you don't mean

16
00:00:42,120 --> 00:00:44,640
to you didn't volunteer for it but it

17
00:00:44,640 --> 00:00:47,700
just happens something gets attacked and

18
00:00:47,700 --> 00:00:49,440
then and it's a piece of software and

19
00:00:49,440 --> 00:00:50,820
the incident response team's usually

20
00:00:50,820 --> 00:00:53,940
like oh no let's go get the app SEC

21
00:00:53,940 --> 00:00:56,940
nerds and that is me and so I want to

22
00:00:56,940 --> 00:00:58,800
talk about what you as a software

23
00:00:58,800 --> 00:01:02,460
developer or a devops person can do to

24
00:01:02,460 --> 00:01:04,920
make sure instant responses basically

25
00:01:04,920 --> 00:01:07,560
like a lot less bad so instant response

26
00:01:07,560 --> 00:01:10,619
for devs for devops folks too instant

27
00:01:10,619 --> 00:01:13,320
response for everyone okay so what the

28
00:01:13,320 --> 00:01:15,840
heck is instant response Tanya

29
00:01:15,840 --> 00:01:18,600
um okay so technically it is an

30
00:01:18,600 --> 00:01:21,000
organized approach to addressing and

31
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:23,460
managing the aftermath of a security

32
00:01:23,460 --> 00:01:24,540
breach

33
00:01:24,540 --> 00:01:27,600
or some sort of I.T security incident so

34
00:01:27,600 --> 00:01:29,340
your website goes down there's a whole

35
00:01:29,340 --> 00:01:31,259
bunch of things that basically

36
00:01:31,259 --> 00:01:33,479
everything's gone wrong you're really

37
00:01:33,479 --> 00:01:36,900
upset usually one of the C I A so

38
00:01:36,900 --> 00:01:39,119
confidentiality Integrity availability

39
00:01:39,119 --> 00:01:41,460
or something else of one of your systems

40
00:01:41,460 --> 00:01:43,860
that you're in charge of is having a bad

41
00:01:43,860 --> 00:01:46,979
bad day and so the goal is to handle the

42
00:01:46,979 --> 00:01:48,600
situation in a way where you limit

43
00:01:48,600 --> 00:01:51,240
damage you reduce costs you get back up

44
00:01:51,240 --> 00:01:53,399
and running as soon as possible and

45
00:01:53,399 --> 00:01:55,680
ideally it's not humiliating for your

46
00:01:55,680 --> 00:01:58,439
organization so you might have seen

47
00:01:58,439 --> 00:02:00,000
situations where you thought it was an

48
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:01,500
incident but it was actually a security

49
00:02:01,500 --> 00:02:06,479
event so a security event basically is

50
00:02:06,479 --> 00:02:08,880
when something weird has happened or is

51
00:02:08,880 --> 00:02:11,340
happening and you're not quite sure if

52
00:02:11,340 --> 00:02:13,020
it's a security incident or you're like

53
00:02:13,020 --> 00:02:14,580
I gotta check this out

54
00:02:14,580 --> 00:02:17,760
well a security incident is when you are

55
00:02:17,760 --> 00:02:20,040
certain that something is or has

56
00:02:20,040 --> 00:02:22,319
happened that is bad so an example would

57
00:02:22,319 --> 00:02:23,280
be

58
00:02:23,280 --> 00:02:25,379
if you find your data for sale on the

59
00:02:25,379 --> 00:02:28,560
dark web that is a security incident and

60
00:02:28,560 --> 00:02:30,780
that has happened to me and that was a

61
00:02:30,780 --> 00:02:32,340
really bad day

62
00:02:32,340 --> 00:02:34,440
I want to give a very quick trigger

63
00:02:34,440 --> 00:02:36,239
warning so one of the examples I'm going

64
00:02:36,239 --> 00:02:38,760
to give is a story where something bad

65
00:02:38,760 --> 00:02:40,860
happens to Children I'm not going to

66
00:02:40,860 --> 00:02:42,480
tell it in a graphic manner I'm not

67
00:02:42,480 --> 00:02:44,760
going to embellish it at all but the

68
00:02:44,760 --> 00:02:46,379
purpose of the story is to drive home

69
00:02:46,379 --> 00:02:48,540
why you need to do number five of the

70
00:02:48,540 --> 00:02:50,879
five things I'm going to list so if you

71
00:02:50,879 --> 00:02:52,140
might get upset if you're a more

72
00:02:52,140 --> 00:02:53,700
sensitive individual and I am a

73
00:02:53,700 --> 00:02:56,280
sensitive individual so I get it feel

74
00:02:56,280 --> 00:02:57,959
free to just come back for the next talk

75
00:02:57,959 --> 00:03:00,300
I don't want to upset anyone

76
00:03:00,300 --> 00:03:03,420
okay so your org needs your app secured

77
00:03:03,420 --> 00:03:06,660
devs are the first line of defense you

78
00:03:06,660 --> 00:03:08,160
are way ahead of the aptech people

79
00:03:08,160 --> 00:03:09,900
because there's somewhere between 100

80
00:03:09,900 --> 00:03:13,440
and 500 of you for every one of me and

81
00:03:13,440 --> 00:03:15,840
so without your buy-in I cannot do this

82
00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:18,540
and if something happens sometimes I

83
00:03:18,540 --> 00:03:20,760
really really need your help and so I

84
00:03:20,760 --> 00:03:23,940
want to ask for five things and I'm

85
00:03:23,940 --> 00:03:26,640
asking for every appsec team

86
00:03:26,640 --> 00:03:29,760
for all devs this is what I would like

87
00:03:29,760 --> 00:03:31,980
so security incidents

88
00:03:31,980 --> 00:03:33,840
so I'm going to go over the five things

89
00:03:33,840 --> 00:03:36,840
so basically one your role during an

90
00:03:36,840 --> 00:03:39,959
incident what I need from you is if the

91
00:03:39,959 --> 00:03:41,879
security like tell us if you see

92
00:03:41,879 --> 00:03:42,840
something

93
00:03:42,840 --> 00:03:45,000
tell us if something's weird I don't

94
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:47,940
care if you give me nine false alarms in

95
00:03:47,940 --> 00:03:50,280
a row I'd rather have you call me and

96
00:03:50,280 --> 00:03:52,920
say a whole bunch of USB Keys just went

97
00:03:52,920 --> 00:03:55,500
missing and I'm kind of freaking out I'd

98
00:03:55,500 --> 00:03:57,659
rather have you tell me this I go and

99
00:03:57,659 --> 00:03:59,280
investigate I find out nothing's

100
00:03:59,280 --> 00:04:01,260
actually wrong

101
00:04:01,260 --> 00:04:04,019
that that makes my day I like it when

102
00:04:04,019 --> 00:04:06,299
nothing happened that's bad it was much

103
00:04:06,299 --> 00:04:08,040
better than you feeling too afraid to

104
00:04:08,040 --> 00:04:09,900
tell me so for instance if your apis

105
00:04:09,900 --> 00:04:11,760
keep falling down over and over and over

106
00:04:11,760 --> 00:04:14,159
again you get a gigantic Cloud bill you

107
00:04:14,159 --> 00:04:17,459
don't understand like things that seem

108
00:04:17,459 --> 00:04:21,418
weird please tell us we'll help I'm not

109
00:04:21,418 --> 00:04:23,040
kidding and

110
00:04:23,040 --> 00:04:26,040
I've never seen a security person get

111
00:04:26,040 --> 00:04:28,740
angry with someone who tried to report

112
00:04:28,740 --> 00:04:30,300
something that they thought was weird

113
00:04:30,300 --> 00:04:32,639
and asked for help I've never seen that

114
00:04:32,639 --> 00:04:34,740
we might get stressed out if there's 400

115
00:04:34,740 --> 00:04:37,199
other things happening but um I'd much

116
00:04:37,199 --> 00:04:39,060
much rather have a whole bunch of false

117
00:04:39,060 --> 00:04:41,100
alarms than miss a really important

118
00:04:41,100 --> 00:04:42,180
thing

119
00:04:42,180 --> 00:04:43,740
okay so the next thing please don't

120
00:04:43,740 --> 00:04:44,820
leave

121
00:04:44,820 --> 00:04:47,220
during a security incident if we've

122
00:04:47,220 --> 00:04:49,199
asked for your help so sometimes the

123
00:04:49,199 --> 00:04:50,940
security incident is happening and it's

124
00:04:50,940 --> 00:04:53,100
it's your app it's your app that's been

125
00:04:53,100 --> 00:04:55,500
attacked or is currently being attacked

126
00:04:55,500 --> 00:04:57,060
and we'll tell you like listen we're

127
00:04:57,060 --> 00:04:58,440
investigating a security incident

128
00:04:58,440 --> 00:05:00,180
something that's happening with your

129
00:05:00,180 --> 00:05:01,919
software that that you're in charge of

130
00:05:01,919 --> 00:05:04,620
as far as we know I need your help and

131
00:05:04,620 --> 00:05:06,540
we'll ask you questions and we'll ask

132
00:05:06,540 --> 00:05:08,639
you to make some time for us and we'll

133
00:05:08,639 --> 00:05:10,139
ask you

134
00:05:10,139 --> 00:05:13,139
like just to be involved and follow like

135
00:05:13,139 --> 00:05:15,720
these five things and please don't leave

136
00:05:15,720 --> 00:05:18,240
this might sound so ridiculous but I I

137
00:05:18,240 --> 00:05:20,100
was actively working on an app that was

138
00:05:20,100 --> 00:05:21,540
actively being attacked so it had

139
00:05:21,540 --> 00:05:23,460
Crossing scripting all sorts of attacks

140
00:05:23,460 --> 00:05:26,100
were like happening live

141
00:05:26,100 --> 00:05:27,539
um and I was talking to the deaf and we

142
00:05:27,539 --> 00:05:28,919
were working on it we're trying really

143
00:05:28,919 --> 00:05:30,360
hard to push out a fix as soon as

144
00:05:30,360 --> 00:05:32,580
possible like literally I was freaking

145
00:05:32,580 --> 00:05:35,699
out and then my boss's boss comes to me

146
00:05:35,699 --> 00:05:37,979
and it's like I need an update for the

147
00:05:37,979 --> 00:05:40,860
director General now so I left yeah they

148
00:05:40,860 --> 00:05:43,139
definitely and took a bus home

149
00:05:43,139 --> 00:05:45,180
didn't leave me a phone number

150
00:05:45,180 --> 00:05:46,860
I was just like

151
00:05:46,860 --> 00:05:49,080
screwed

152
00:05:49,080 --> 00:05:51,060
um and my boss was so angry with me you

153
00:05:51,060 --> 00:05:52,560
didn't tell him not to leave I'm like I

154
00:05:52,560 --> 00:05:54,060
thought it would be really obvious like

155
00:05:54,060 --> 00:05:56,520
malicious act and I I didn't even know

156
00:05:56,520 --> 00:05:58,740
how to turn the app off

157
00:05:58,740 --> 00:06:01,800
and So that obviously was like uh like a

158
00:06:01,800 --> 00:06:03,539
really really bad day for me and my team

159
00:06:03,539 --> 00:06:05,220
and so please don't leave the premises

160
00:06:05,220 --> 00:06:07,800
if we've tapped you to help without

161
00:06:07,800 --> 00:06:09,660
telling me like he could have just given

162
00:06:09,660 --> 00:06:11,280
me his phone number and that would have

163
00:06:11,280 --> 00:06:13,380
been fine but this is well this is the

164
00:06:13,380 --> 00:06:14,940
next one so please treat it like the

165
00:06:14,940 --> 00:06:17,580
emergency that it is like it's nice that

166
00:06:17,580 --> 00:06:20,039

00:06:34,620 --> 00:06:36,660
important I'll give them the briefest

174
00:06:36,660 --> 00:06:39,180
minimum information that they need

175
00:06:39,180 --> 00:06:40,979
because of number four which is in the

176
00:06:40,979 --> 00:06:44,039
next slide but we will cover for you we

177
00:06:44,039 --> 00:06:46,440
need your help you're the expert if your

178
00:06:46,440 --> 00:06:48,180
app is being attacked you probably know

179
00:06:48,180 --> 00:06:50,220
it way better than our team does and so

180
00:06:50,220 --> 00:06:52,319
please treat it like the emergency it is

181
00:06:52,319 --> 00:06:54,419
and prioritize it

182
00:06:54,419 --> 00:06:56,220
Follow Need to Know

183
00:06:56,220 --> 00:06:57,960
you do not need to give every single

184
00:06:57,960 --> 00:06:59,699
detail to your boss even if your boss is

185
00:06:59,699 --> 00:07:01,800
super curious and thinks it's cool

186
00:07:01,800 --> 00:07:04,740
you can blame it on me totally blame it

187
00:07:04,740 --> 00:07:07,020
on me be like Kanye is so mean she said

188
00:07:07,020 --> 00:07:08,520
I'm not allowed telling you she seems

189
00:07:08,520 --> 00:07:10,440
pretty scary

190
00:07:10,440 --> 00:07:12,840
don't run around and tell people I kid

191
00:07:12,840 --> 00:07:15,060
you not I um I was working at a place

192
00:07:15,060 --> 00:07:17,220
that will remain unnamed and I had to go

193
00:07:17,220 --> 00:07:18,840
to the dentist so I I like really like

194
00:07:18,840 --> 00:07:21,360
my teeth so I go to the dentist at least

195
00:07:21,360 --> 00:07:23,280
once a year usually twice a year I

196
00:07:23,280 --> 00:07:25,080
really like not having cavities and

197
00:07:25,080 --> 00:07:26,460
anyway so I was at the dentist everyone

198
00:07:26,460 --> 00:07:28,080
knew I was at the dentist my whole team

199
00:07:28,080 --> 00:07:30,419
knew and it helped us person had decided

200
00:07:30,419 --> 00:07:32,940
that he was going to manage a security

201
00:07:32,940 --> 00:07:36,419
incident and um so I come in and my

202
00:07:36,419 --> 00:07:39,360
team's like run run to the big room the

203
00:07:39,360 --> 00:07:40,919
big meeting room all the executives

204
00:07:40,919 --> 00:07:42,840
their hair is on fire everything bad's

205
00:07:42,840 --> 00:07:45,960
happening and so basically this uh stop

206
00:07:45,960 --> 00:07:48,000
like this helped us person decided to

207
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:50,580
try to manage this thing themselves they

208
00:07:50,580 --> 00:07:52,919
thought that a building a dumb building

209
00:07:52,919 --> 00:07:55,440
not a smart building had nowhere

210
00:07:55,440 --> 00:07:57,240
really it was just a bunch of Canadians

211
00:07:57,240 --> 00:07:58,440
watching the Olympics because figure

212
00:07:58,440 --> 00:08:01,020
skating was on and that is our Jam as a

213
00:08:01,020 --> 00:08:03,840
nation we really really like ice skating

214
00:08:03,840 --> 00:08:06,539
and anyway I knew that because I do this

215
00:08:06,539 --> 00:08:08,340
work right so immediately I'm like is

216
00:08:08,340 --> 00:08:10,199
this the Olympics again

217
00:08:10,199 --> 00:08:12,060
um but meanwhile he had told all the

218
00:08:12,060 --> 00:08:13,620
executives he had all of them panicking

219
00:08:13,620 --> 00:08:15,000
they're like are people in that building

220
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:16,979
safe I'm like well I don't know if

221
00:08:16,979 --> 00:08:18,780
Canada's gonna win or not this year but

222
00:08:18,780 --> 00:08:20,940
like otherwise we're pretty safe like

223
00:08:20,940 --> 00:08:22,860
and so everyone started telling everyone

224
00:08:22,860 --> 00:08:24,960
because at the beginning of an incident

225
00:08:24,960 --> 00:08:27,240
the first thing I say is I want you to

226
00:08:27,240 --> 00:08:29,460
go over what need to know means don't

227
00:08:29,460 --> 00:08:31,919
run around and tell everyone only tell

228
00:08:31,919 --> 00:08:35,159
people if they must know

229
00:08:35,159 --> 00:08:36,779
don't tell your friends don't tell your

230
00:08:36,779 --> 00:08:39,000
admin assistant don't tell your mom

231
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:41,219
even though your mom's probably awesome

232
00:08:41,219 --> 00:08:43,140
please follow need to know and only tell

233
00:08:43,140 --> 00:08:46,260
the people who actually need to know

234
00:08:46,260 --> 00:08:49,260
okay so the last one do not try to

235
00:08:49,260 --> 00:08:51,000
manage the incident yourself and be a

236
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:53,100
hero and I I know I gave the example

237
00:08:53,100 --> 00:08:55,080
previously of the guy that thought a

238
00:08:55,080 --> 00:08:58,740
building made of concrete in the 80s was

239
00:08:58,740 --> 00:09:00,420
infected with malware my concrete

240
00:09:00,420 --> 00:09:02,820
doesn't get malware that was like a

241
00:09:02,820 --> 00:09:05,399
silly story compared to um so one of my

242
00:09:05,399 --> 00:09:08,220
friends and colleagues and person I

243
00:09:08,220 --> 00:09:10,860
deeply respect he taught me instant

244
00:09:10,860 --> 00:09:13,920
response and he told me he's like I

245
00:09:13,920 --> 00:09:16,800
always go over this with help desk I

246
00:09:16,800 --> 00:09:18,779
always teach this to Sis admins I teach

247
00:09:18,779 --> 00:09:21,180
this to everyone and it's because when I

248
00:09:21,180 --> 00:09:22,800
swing incident response at a place that

249
00:09:22,800 --> 00:09:24,660
helped us person decided to take it upon

250
00:09:24,660 --> 00:09:28,200
themselves to respond to an incident and

251
00:09:28,200 --> 00:09:30,839
they found images of child abuse

252
00:09:30,839 --> 00:09:33,600
and unfortunately in doing so they

253
00:09:33,600 --> 00:09:36,000
ruined the entire chain of custody and

254
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:37,560
the person who committed this awful

255
00:09:37,560 --> 00:09:39,000
crime went free

256
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:41,700
his colleague has helped us person ended

257
00:09:41,700 --> 00:09:44,040
up being in therapy for years from first

258
00:09:44,040 --> 00:09:45,600
of all from being exposed to things he

259
00:09:45,600 --> 00:09:48,120
should never ever ever have seen

260
00:09:48,120 --> 00:09:50,640
but also because this criminal went free

261
00:09:50,640 --> 00:09:52,800
who should be locked away for the end of

262
00:09:52,800 --> 00:09:55,440
time and so

263
00:09:55,440 --> 00:09:57,839
US security folks especially those of us

264
00:09:57,839 --> 00:09:59,640
with instant response training not only

265
00:09:59,640 --> 00:10:02,040
can we ensure we don't ruin the chain of

266
00:10:02,040 --> 00:10:04,080
custody so criminals get what they

267
00:10:04,080 --> 00:10:05,640
deserve

268
00:10:05,640 --> 00:10:07,500
but we know how to make sure we don't

269
00:10:07,500 --> 00:10:09,420
accidentally stumble upon something like

270
00:10:09,420 --> 00:10:11,640
that we know how to manage these

271
00:10:11,640 --> 00:10:14,640
situations differently and we also are

272
00:10:14,640 --> 00:10:18,000
prepared to carry this heavy emotional

273
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:21,000
task if we have to that's not your job

274
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:23,100
if you do help desk you do software

275
00:10:23,100 --> 00:10:24,360
development it doesn't matter that's not

276
00:10:24,360 --> 00:10:27,360
your job and I remember when I started

277
00:10:27,360 --> 00:10:30,540
in Security in 2007 I did anti-terrorism

278
00:10:30,540 --> 00:10:33,180
activities and I ended up in therapy

279
00:10:33,180 --> 00:10:36,360
because that is really hard when like

280
00:10:36,360 --> 00:10:37,740
hundreds of lives depend on your

281
00:10:37,740 --> 00:10:39,660
everyday work and so I left security

282
00:10:39,660 --> 00:10:41,220
went back to software development and

283
00:10:41,220 --> 00:10:42,480
then eventually went to security again

284
00:10:42,480 --> 00:10:44,880
and learned there's less scary jobs out

285
00:10:44,880 --> 00:10:48,240
there I don't want any of you to have to

286
00:10:48,240 --> 00:10:50,459
carry this it's not your job it's not

287
00:10:50,459 --> 00:10:51,899
your responsibility and it's not fair

288
00:10:51,899 --> 00:10:55,380
and so please don't be a hero call us in

289
00:10:55,380 --> 00:10:57,240
so we can handle it and we can make sure

290
00:10:57,240 --> 00:10:59,519
everything goes smoothly everyone is

291
00:10:59,519 --> 00:11:01,260
protected and you don't end up in a

292
00:11:01,260 --> 00:11:03,420
situation you should never have been in

293
00:11:03,420 --> 00:11:05,880
and so if you wanted to take a

294
00:11:05,880 --> 00:11:08,100
screenshot of a slide this would be the

295
00:11:08,100 --> 00:11:10,500
slide these are the five things I really

296
00:11:10,500 --> 00:11:12,120
really really really really really want

297
00:11:12,120 --> 00:11:14,100
you to know

298
00:11:14,100 --> 00:11:15,480
um and while you're taking a screenshot

299
00:11:15,480 --> 00:11:16,800
of this slide briefly I'm going to tell

300
00:11:16,800 --> 00:11:19,260
you a funny story to bring things up on

301
00:11:19,260 --> 00:11:20,640
a lighter note before I give you some

302
00:11:20,640 --> 00:11:23,339
free resources so one of the times I was

303
00:11:23,339 --> 00:11:25,560
doing incident response we got sent a

304
00:11:25,560 --> 00:11:27,240
thing from the social media team and

305
00:11:27,240 --> 00:11:29,940
someone had made a comment about our

306
00:11:29,940 --> 00:11:32,160
company and our company was bilingual

307
00:11:32,160 --> 00:11:33,720
because we're Canadian so we would do

308
00:11:33,720 --> 00:11:34,920
everything in French and English our

309
00:11:34,920 --> 00:11:37,019
website was in French and English and

310
00:11:37,019 --> 00:11:39,360
basically there was a survey

311
00:11:39,360 --> 00:11:41,160
um and and the person had tweeted a

312
00:11:41,160 --> 00:11:42,779
screenshot of our website and it said

313
00:11:42,779 --> 00:11:46,740
are you a man are you a wife

314
00:11:46,740 --> 00:11:48,540
um you know do you like this or are you

315
00:11:48,540 --> 00:11:51,360
sex and it was very confusing and we

316
00:11:51,360 --> 00:11:52,920
looked on our website clearly it was

317
00:11:52,920 --> 00:11:53,760
fine

318
00:11:53,760 --> 00:11:55,680
and they're like you have 14 minutes all

319
00:11:55,680 --> 00:11:57,420
the c-level executives are freaking out

320
00:11:57,420 --> 00:11:59,579
the media is calling us everyone's like

321
00:11:59,579 --> 00:12:02,579
how dare you be so insensitive like if

322
00:12:02,579 --> 00:12:04,200
you're a man or a wife you can't just be

323
00:12:04,200 --> 00:12:05,760
a woman blah blah blah you don't even

324
00:12:05,760 --> 00:12:07,200
cover non-binary you guys are so

325
00:12:07,200 --> 00:12:08,399
insensitive

326
00:12:08,399 --> 00:12:11,040
and it turned out that um a person who's

327
00:12:11,040 --> 00:12:13,560
not good at the internet had just gone

328
00:12:13,560 --> 00:12:15,660
to our website in French Google had

329
00:12:15,660 --> 00:12:17,399
offered to translate it the word in

330
00:12:17,399 --> 00:12:21,000
French for uh like fam means woman or

331
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:21,779
wife

332
00:12:21,779 --> 00:12:24,420
so it shows wife and all the different

333
00:12:24,420 --> 00:12:26,279
insensitivities were just Google doing a

334
00:12:26,279 --> 00:12:28,079
bad job of translating because of a lack

335
00:12:28,079 --> 00:12:29,339
of context

336
00:12:29,339 --> 00:12:31,500
and so then I was asked so in 14 minutes

337
00:12:31,500 --> 00:12:33,300
we investigated we figured it out I'm

338
00:12:33,300 --> 00:12:34,980
like we're totally awesome this is great

339
00:12:34,980 --> 00:12:38,399
and then they're like Tanya write a note

340
00:12:38,399 --> 00:12:41,459
for the media that we can give and I was

341
00:12:41,459 --> 00:12:43,440
like okay here we go

342
00:12:43,440 --> 00:12:45,180
dear so and so

343
00:12:45,180 --> 00:12:46,860
I'm sorry that you are not smart enough

344
00:12:46,860 --> 00:12:48,480
to use the internet

345
00:12:48,480 --> 00:12:50,220
your life must be very difficult they're

346
00:12:50,220 --> 00:12:51,779
like get out of here get out of here and

347
00:12:51,779 --> 00:12:54,060
then I was never asked right media

348
00:12:54,060 --> 00:12:56,100
relation articles again so it was great

349
00:12:56,100 --> 00:12:59,160
everyone won and so with that I want to

350
00:12:59,160 --> 00:13:01,980
ask you very briefly to tell the appsec

351
00:13:01,980 --> 00:13:04,680
team so if you don't know ask the

352
00:13:04,680 --> 00:13:07,380

353
00:13:07,380 --> 00:13:09,000

00:14:51,720 --> 00:14:53,940
my very short talk

401
00:14:53,940 --> 00:14:56,880
we do have a few seconds in case there

402
00:14:56,880 --> 00:14:58,680
are any questions I don't see any in the

403
00:14:58,680 --> 00:15:00,240
chat at the moment but maybe Micah or

404
00:15:00,240 --> 00:15:03,300
Eric any questions for Tanya

405
00:15:03,300 --> 00:15:06,120
that was amazing I'm still I'm still

406
00:15:06,120 --> 00:15:08,459
processing

407
00:15:08,459 --> 00:15:10,199
I actually have like many many more

408
00:15:10,199 --> 00:15:12,540
stories and so I teach secure coding all

409
00:15:12,540 --> 00:15:14,279
the time and usually the last half hour

410
00:15:14,279 --> 00:15:16,380
time hour of the day we just go over all

411
00:15:16,380 --> 00:15:18,360
the ways and usually there's a ton of

412
00:15:18,360 --> 00:15:19,980
incidents they've had that they didn't

413
00:15:19,980 --> 00:15:21,600
realize and so they finally start

414
00:15:21,600 --> 00:15:24,720
reporting them and life's better I I

415
00:15:24,720 --> 00:15:26,040
appreciated the way you handled that

416
00:15:26,040 --> 00:15:28,260
very sensitive subject in there

417
00:15:28,260 --> 00:15:31,139
um I I know how hard that can be as an

418
00:15:31,139 --> 00:15:32,940
Airline employee from years ago there

419
00:15:32,940 --> 00:15:33,959
are things that Airlines have to deal

420
00:15:33,959 --> 00:15:34,680
with

421
00:15:34,680 --> 00:15:37,260
that are hellaciously tragic and and

422
00:15:37,260 --> 00:15:38,940
yeah

423
00:15:38,940 --> 00:15:41,100
I can only imagine yeah it's a tough

424
00:15:41,100 --> 00:15:44,519
tough world yeah

425
00:15:44,519 --> 00:15:46,680
and it's important that people that are

426
00:15:46,680 --> 00:15:49,800
prepared to do those tough jobs do them

427
00:15:49,800 --> 00:15:51,720
as opposed to someone that has no idea

428
00:15:51,720 --> 00:15:54,120
and could like really fall down a

429
00:15:54,120 --> 00:15:55,860
slippery slope they never intended to be

430
00:15:55,860 --> 00:15:56,760
on

431
00:15:56,760 --> 00:15:58,260
all right I have one question for you

432
00:15:58,260 --> 00:15:59,820
and then we'll have to break and go to

433
00:15:59,820 --> 00:16:03,360
the next session did the Canadian ice

434
00:16:03,360 --> 00:16:06,320
skating team win in that story

435
00:16:06,320 --> 00:16:08,279
so honestly

436
00:16:08,279 --> 00:16:10,019
honestar so it was the Winter Olympics

437
00:16:10,019 --> 00:16:13,079
and like I know we placed somewhere but

438
00:16:13,079 --> 00:16:15,720
I don't know if we were like gold silver

439
00:16:15,720 --> 00:16:18,660
um or bronze but um yeah it turned out

440
00:16:18,660 --> 00:16:20,459
it's just every single person watching

441
00:16:20,459 --> 00:16:22,139
the Olympics from their desk and usually

442
00:16:22,139 --> 00:16:23,699
what wait till we know Canadians that

443
00:16:23,699 --> 00:16:25,199
really dig this so usually what we do is

444
00:16:25,199 --> 00:16:26,639
we have like a board room in each

445
00:16:26,639 --> 00:16:27,720
building and we're like if you're gonna

446
00:16:27,720 --> 00:16:29,100
watch the Olympics go the boardroom

447
00:16:29,100 --> 00:16:31,440
don't stream it from your desk with some

448
00:16:31,440 --> 00:16:33,120
big up boss for that building was like

449
00:16:33,120 --> 00:16:35,220
you have to take vacation time if you

450
00:16:35,220 --> 00:16:38,220
want to see our stars do their thing and

451
00:16:38,220 --> 00:16:40,380
so just like every single person there

452
00:16:40,380 --> 00:16:41,639
was at least three or four hundred

453
00:16:41,639 --> 00:16:43,620
computers all watching the same video

454
00:16:43,620 --> 00:16:45,660
and yeah we figured out what happened

455
00:16:45,660 --> 00:16:49,759
really fast oh and I love the stories

456
00:16:49,759 --> 00:16:52,199
seriously for six months people would be

457
00:16:52,199 --> 00:16:53,579
like did you know that there's a

458
00:16:53,579 --> 00:16:55,019
building that has malware and I'd be

459
00:16:55,019 --> 00:16:57,300
like yeah

460
00:16:57,300 --> 00:16:59,639
