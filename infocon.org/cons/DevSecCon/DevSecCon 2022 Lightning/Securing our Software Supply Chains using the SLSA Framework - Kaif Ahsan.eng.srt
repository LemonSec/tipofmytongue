1
00:00:00,480 --> 00:00:04,440
okay so we have the next speaker in line

2
00:00:04,440 --> 00:00:08,460
um so we have Kai fasan uh Kaif is a

3
00:00:08,460 --> 00:00:10,620
quarter by Passion and a Haku by

4
00:00:10,620 --> 00:00:13,080
profession he started his journey in

5
00:00:13,080 --> 00:00:15,480
Tech as a software engineer but soon

6
00:00:15,480 --> 00:00:17,820
fell in love with the art of reading net

7
00:00:17,820 --> 00:00:21,060
sofa his knowledge of development and

8
00:00:21,060 --> 00:00:23,520
cyber security has naturally led him to

9
00:00:23,520 --> 00:00:26,039
application security space where he

10
00:00:26,039 --> 00:00:27,539
currently is working as a product

11
00:00:27,539 --> 00:00:29,960
security engineer at atlation

12
00:00:29,960 --> 00:00:32,880
kaith is a big big proponent of

13
00:00:32,880 --> 00:00:35,940
education and open access to it

14
00:00:35,940 --> 00:00:39,360
knowledge he regularly volunteers to run

15
00:00:39,360 --> 00:00:41,219
cyber security workshops at various

16
00:00:41,219 --> 00:00:42,840
universities

17
00:00:42,840 --> 00:00:45,239
um giving talks at local meetups and

18
00:00:45,239 --> 00:00:47,160
conferences as well

19
00:00:47,160 --> 00:00:49,379
um he is also the co-host for the

20
00:00:49,379 --> 00:00:51,480
amazing YouTube channel everything cyber

21
00:00:51,480 --> 00:00:53,640
where he shares Hands-On and

22
00:00:53,640 --> 00:00:55,680
conversational videos on Tech and cyber

23
00:00:55,680 --> 00:00:58,379
security his videos Target uh

24
00:00:58,379 --> 00:01:00,660
intermediate level professionals and

25
00:01:00,660 --> 00:01:02,640
helped them to gain expertise through

26
00:01:02,640 --> 00:01:04,739
practical content

27
00:01:04,739 --> 00:01:08,100
um today's talk for Kaif is uh based on

28
00:01:08,100 --> 00:01:11,340
securing our software Supply change uh

29
00:01:11,340 --> 00:01:14,939
Jane's using salsa framework welcome to

30
00:01:14,939 --> 00:01:20,460
devsec con kive and hello okay thank you

31
00:01:20,460 --> 00:01:22,619
for joining us uh I'm particularly

32
00:01:22,619 --> 00:01:24,420
interested in this because you know I'm

33
00:01:24,420 --> 00:01:26,159
very interested in all things supply

34
00:01:26,159 --> 00:01:28,080
chain Security even though it is a

35
00:01:28,080 --> 00:01:30,420
buzzword and I'm really interested for

36
00:01:30,420 --> 00:01:32,820
this particular one so what we'll do is

37
00:01:32,820 --> 00:01:34,860
We'll add your slides over here and

38
00:01:34,860 --> 00:01:36,780
kavika and I will go off to the

39
00:01:36,780 --> 00:01:38,340
background I also did want to take this

40
00:01:38,340 --> 00:01:39,960
opportunity just to thank avika so she

41
00:01:39,960 --> 00:01:41,280
will be heading off it will have another

42
00:01:41,280 --> 00:01:43,320
co-host joining us but thank you so much

43
00:01:43,320 --> 00:01:45,299
for co-hosting and kicking off death

44
00:01:45,299 --> 00:01:48,659
second 2022 with us uh and Keith I will

45
00:01:48,659 --> 00:01:51,600
say let you take it away yep thank you

46
00:01:51,600 --> 00:01:53,820
so much kavika for hosting and I think

47
00:01:53,820 --> 00:01:55,979
you did a much better introduction to

48
00:01:55,979 --> 00:01:58,439
for myself than I ever could so thanks

49
00:01:58,439 --> 00:02:00,119
for that as well

50
00:02:00,119 --> 00:02:02,700
um hello everyone welcome to my talk on

51
00:02:02,700 --> 00:02:05,460
securing the software supply chain using

52
00:02:05,460 --> 00:02:07,560
the salsa framework

53
00:02:07,560 --> 00:02:09,899
I think kavika already has given a

54
00:02:09,899 --> 00:02:11,580
pretty good introduction on myself so

55
00:02:11,580 --> 00:02:13,379
I'll not spend any more time on this

56
00:02:13,379 --> 00:02:15,239
slide and get started with the talk

57
00:02:15,239 --> 00:02:16,500
directly

58
00:02:16,500 --> 00:02:18,780
so let's try to understand what today's

59
00:02:18,780 --> 00:02:20,400
agenda is about

60
00:02:20,400 --> 00:02:22,500
we'll first try to understand the

61
00:02:22,500 --> 00:02:25,080
landscape where a framework like salsa

62
00:02:25,080 --> 00:02:27,120
is required and then give a quick

63
00:02:27,120 --> 00:02:29,160
introduction to salsa

64
00:02:29,160 --> 00:02:31,980
understand what value it brings and

65
00:02:31,980 --> 00:02:35,700
lastly what does salsa not cover

66
00:02:35,700 --> 00:02:38,640
cool let us understand the landscape and

67
00:02:38,640 --> 00:02:41,099
I'd like to do that with sharing two of

68
00:02:41,099 --> 00:02:43,080
my favorite memes

69
00:02:43,080 --> 00:02:46,140
um the first one being

70
00:02:46,140 --> 00:02:48,599
us from coming from a soft engineering

71
00:02:48,599 --> 00:02:50,099
background

72
00:02:50,099 --> 00:02:53,099
um yeah it's safe to say that it's just

73
00:02:53,099 --> 00:02:55,560
not just me a large portion of us also

74
00:02:55,560 --> 00:02:59,040
rely heavily on Outsourcing our sort of

75
00:02:59,040 --> 00:03:00,959
work from stack Overflow and a lot of

76
00:03:00,959 --> 00:03:02,940
other places and that's actually the

77
00:03:02,940 --> 00:03:05,580
beauty of it as well like very few other

78
00:03:05,580 --> 00:03:08,280
Industries are as open and collaborative

79
00:03:08,280 --> 00:03:11,300
as I.T

80
00:03:11,700 --> 00:03:14,280
aking it up a notch and we're so

81
00:03:14,280 --> 00:03:16,500
confident in these kind of projects in

82
00:03:16,500 --> 00:03:19,260
open source that many of our large-scale

83
00:03:19,260 --> 00:03:21,599
Enterprise softwares which are used by

84
00:03:21,599 --> 00:03:24,000
millions if not billions of people often

85
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:27,120
rely on small open source projects

86
00:03:27,120 --> 00:03:28,920
which also

87
00:03:28,920 --> 00:03:31,440
brings us to the other side of the coin

88
00:03:31,440 --> 00:03:32,879
that

89
00:03:32,879 --> 00:03:35,640
supply chain attacks has been one of the

90
00:03:35,640 --> 00:03:37,319
biggest considerations and issues in

91
00:03:37,319 --> 00:03:40,019
cyber security because in software so

92
00:03:40,019 --> 00:03:42,000
far we really haven't put in a much

93
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:45,299
thought on how does how does these

94
00:03:45,299 --> 00:03:47,879
components have been produced are they

95
00:03:47,879 --> 00:03:50,400
safe to use and whatnot and that led to

96
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:52,680
various attacks like the lock for Jake

97
00:03:52,680 --> 00:03:56,659
caseya solar winds and much more

98
00:03:57,959 --> 00:04:01,080
and it's not just the vulnerability in

99
00:04:01,080 --> 00:04:04,019
third-party libraries that are causing

100
00:04:04,019 --> 00:04:06,900
so much pain in the supply chain we have

101
00:04:06,900 --> 00:04:09,180
seen visibility of what we're using and

102
00:04:09,180 --> 00:04:12,120
how is a big issue for folks who are

103
00:04:12,120 --> 00:04:15,420
involved in the log 4J incident we had

104
00:04:15,420 --> 00:04:17,699
to scramble a lot to figure out that hey

105
00:04:17,699 --> 00:04:19,978
which of our products and repositories

106
00:04:19,978 --> 00:04:23,580
uh do use lock4j and figuring that out

107
00:04:23,580 --> 00:04:27,139
was hard similarly the Integrity or

108
00:04:27,139 --> 00:04:29,759
figuring out whether our software has

109
00:04:29,759 --> 00:04:31,979
been tampered or not is a big issue and

110
00:04:31,979 --> 00:04:33,840
it's just not our software that we put

111
00:04:33,840 --> 00:04:36,180
in front of the users the software that

112
00:04:36,180 --> 00:04:37,979
we are getting from open source from

113
00:04:37,979 --> 00:04:40,620
different vendors is that has is that

114
00:04:40,620 --> 00:04:44,280
Integra is that say secure as well is a

115
00:04:44,280 --> 00:04:45,540
big question

116
00:04:45,540 --> 00:04:48,600
and the lastly the remediation even if

117
00:04:48,600 --> 00:04:51,419
we know that something is broken how

118
00:04:51,419 --> 00:04:53,100
quickly can we replace it from our

119
00:04:53,100 --> 00:04:55,560
supply chain and oftentimes that period

120
00:04:55,560 --> 00:04:57,419
is long enough for attackers to

121
00:04:57,419 --> 00:04:59,460
compromise

122
00:04:59,460 --> 00:05:01,320
and all of these issues are quite

123
00:05:01,320 --> 00:05:03,540
complex on their own and they deserve

124
00:05:03,540 --> 00:05:05,040
their own lightning talks and if not

125
00:05:05,040 --> 00:05:08,280
in-depth talks if I'm honest in my talk

126
00:05:08,280 --> 00:05:10,500
I'll Focus explicitly on the Integrity

127
00:05:10,500 --> 00:05:13,259
side of things because ensuring that our

128
00:05:13,259 --> 00:05:15,479
software has not been tampered with is a

129
00:05:15,479 --> 00:05:17,160
big challenge

130
00:05:17,160 --> 00:05:19,080
let's look at the typical software

131
00:05:19,080 --> 00:05:21,540
development lifecycle on one end we have

132
00:05:21,540 --> 00:05:23,699
the developer creating the source which

133
00:05:23,699 --> 00:05:26,039
then get gets built and then packaged up

134
00:05:26,039 --> 00:05:28,320
for the users to consume it and

135
00:05:28,320 --> 00:05:30,120
throughout this phase there are lots of

136
00:05:30,120 --> 00:05:32,639
areas where tampering can happen

137
00:05:32,639 --> 00:05:35,280
all these attack factors make

138
00:05:35,280 --> 00:05:37,259
secure software development very very

139
00:05:37,259 --> 00:05:41,160
hard because is the build we created uh

140
00:05:41,160 --> 00:05:44,280
secure has it been tampered is the

141
00:05:44,280 --> 00:05:46,800
software again we're giving to the our

142
00:05:46,800 --> 00:05:49,979
clients and customers is has it has the

143
00:05:49,979 --> 00:05:52,020
attacker managed to slip in or do

144
00:05:52,020 --> 00:05:54,720
something with it figuring out all these

145
00:05:54,720 --> 00:05:57,060
things is very very difficult and that's

146
00:05:57,060 --> 00:05:58,940
why we've been seeing so many

147
00:05:58,940 --> 00:06:01,320
large-scale attacks

148
00:06:01,320 --> 00:06:03,960
attacks like solarwinds is a big example

149
00:06:03,960 --> 00:06:06,000
where the build platform was compromised

150
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:08,580
and it was a very very complicated and

151
00:06:08,580 --> 00:06:11,240
complex attack

152
00:06:11,699 --> 00:06:14,100
so how do we ensure Integrity of our

153
00:06:14,100 --> 00:06:16,139
software how do we make sure that no one

154
00:06:16,139 --> 00:06:17,759
has tampered with it

155
00:06:17,759 --> 00:06:19,979
and that's where the salsa framework

156
00:06:19,979 --> 00:06:21,300
comes in

157
00:06:21,300 --> 00:06:24,960
the salsa or SLA slsa stands for supply

158
00:06:24,960 --> 00:06:27,660
chain levels for software artifacts and

159
00:06:27,660 --> 00:06:31,259
fiction affectionately called as salsa

160
00:06:31,259 --> 00:06:34,139
it is basically a checklist of standards

161
00:06:34,139 --> 00:06:36,479
and controls that prevent from prevent

162
00:06:36,479 --> 00:06:38,699
tampering from happening in our supply

163
00:06:38,699 --> 00:06:41,819
chain and it's just not just a big list

164
00:06:41,819 --> 00:06:44,340
uh that we need to follow it actually is

165
00:06:44,340 --> 00:06:46,199
like a road map that people can

166
00:06:46,199 --> 00:06:48,780
gradually use to secure their supply

167
00:06:48,780 --> 00:06:51,660
chain and the best part is probably it's

168
00:06:51,660 --> 00:06:53,699
vendor neutral and it's industry

169
00:06:53,699 --> 00:06:56,940
collaborative uh framework that is led

170
00:06:56,940 --> 00:06:59,280
by the open ssf foundation which is

171
00:06:59,280 --> 00:07:01,979
backed by huge organizations like Google

172
00:07:01,979 --> 00:07:05,220
Microsoft atlassian and many other

173
00:07:05,220 --> 00:07:08,100
so let's look at some use cases of salsa

174
00:07:08,100 --> 00:07:10,620
and the first one is obviously for

175
00:07:10,620 --> 00:07:12,900
organizations who want to make sure that

176
00:07:12,900 --> 00:07:15,419
their software hasn't been tampered with

177
00:07:15,419 --> 00:07:18,360
and it's not just one size that everyone

178
00:07:18,360 --> 00:07:21,000
needs to conform all the organizations

179
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:24,120
can use salsa according to their needs

180
00:07:24,120 --> 00:07:26,120
to

181
00:07:26,120 --> 00:07:29,400
achieve supply chain security and

182
00:07:29,400 --> 00:07:31,199
following the different salsa levels

183
00:07:31,199 --> 00:07:33,500
we'll get we'll look at them in a second

184
00:07:33,500 --> 00:07:36,660
and zooming into that organization

185
00:07:36,660 --> 00:07:40,340
security organizations can use salsa to

186
00:07:40,340 --> 00:07:43,080
securely consume open source software

187
00:07:43,080 --> 00:07:45,180
and it's not just open source software

188
00:07:45,180 --> 00:07:47,520
it's also the software we're getting

189
00:07:47,520 --> 00:07:49,860
from our vendors and our third parties

190
00:07:49,860 --> 00:07:52,319
and other places we can use salsa to

191
00:07:52,319 --> 00:07:54,479
ensure that the software they created

192
00:07:54,479 --> 00:07:56,940
and the software we are using are

193
00:07:56,940 --> 00:07:58,680
actually the same one and nothing has

194
00:07:58,680 --> 00:08:01,020
been tampered with

195
00:08:01,020 --> 00:08:04,020
so how does salsa actually does that

196
00:08:04,020 --> 00:08:06,780
to understand that we need to be aware

197
00:08:06,780 --> 00:08:09,780
of a few basic terminologies now these

198
00:08:09,780 --> 00:08:11,639
terminologies are going to be used a lot

199
00:08:11,639 --> 00:08:13,919
throughout this presentation as well as

200
00:08:13,919 --> 00:08:15,840
if when you explore salsa by yourself

201
00:08:15,840 --> 00:08:18,780
you come across them quite a bit so it's

202
00:08:18,780 --> 00:08:22,340
quite important that we covered them

203
00:08:22,379 --> 00:08:24,599
the first two major ones I'm going to

204
00:08:24,599 --> 00:08:27,120
cover are two big words provenance and

205
00:08:27,120 --> 00:08:30,120
attestation so what do they even mean

206
00:08:30,120 --> 00:08:32,599
provenance is basically

207
00:08:32,599 --> 00:08:35,640
some very viable information that helps

208
00:08:35,640 --> 00:08:37,320
us understand whether a piece of

209
00:08:37,320 --> 00:08:40,320
software has been tampered or not so it

210
00:08:40,320 --> 00:08:42,779
is information like where when and how

211
00:08:42,779 --> 00:08:44,459
something was produced

212
00:08:44,459 --> 00:08:46,140
that's basically it

213
00:08:46,140 --> 00:08:49,260
and the other word is attestation

214
00:08:49,260 --> 00:08:51,480
think of attestation like a certificate

215
00:08:51,480 --> 00:08:53,940
an automated way provenance can be

216
00:08:53,940 --> 00:08:56,220
verified so oftentimes it is machine

217
00:08:56,220 --> 00:08:59,100
readable metadata about different stages

218
00:08:59,100 --> 00:09:01,440
of the software development life cycle

219
00:09:01,440 --> 00:09:03,600
and different stages of that software

220
00:09:03,600 --> 00:09:05,820
and using that certificate we can show

221
00:09:05,820 --> 00:09:08,519
that the authenticity authenticity for

222
00:09:08,519 --> 00:09:10,920
example when the software after it is

223
00:09:10,920 --> 00:09:12,860
built and before it is packaged

224
00:09:12,860 --> 00:09:15,600
attestation is can be like a certificate

225
00:09:15,600 --> 00:09:18,180
where we we can go like is this software

226
00:09:18,180 --> 00:09:21,480
secure it hasn't been tampered with if

227
00:09:21,480 --> 00:09:26,240
if not then we we continue using it

228
00:09:26,240 --> 00:09:28,860
the other two ones I want to cover is

229
00:09:28,860 --> 00:09:31,980
artifacts and sdlc artifacts is

230
00:09:31,980 --> 00:09:34,200
basically a general way of saying that

231
00:09:34,200 --> 00:09:36,300
this is a piece of data it can be

232
00:09:36,300 --> 00:09:38,519
anything like a file a commit or even a

233
00:09:38,519 --> 00:09:40,800
container image

234
00:09:40,800 --> 00:09:42,720
and then lastly something I'm going to

235
00:09:42,720 --> 00:09:45,420
use a lot is sdlc which is just an

236
00:09:45,420 --> 00:09:47,580
acronym for software development life

237
00:09:47,580 --> 00:09:50,040
cycle but in case anyone is not familiar

238
00:09:50,040 --> 00:09:51,839
with it I thought I'll just give a heads

239
00:09:51,839 --> 00:09:53,160
up

240
00:09:53,160 --> 00:09:56,360
so going back to the question how does

241
00:09:56,360 --> 00:10:00,740
sal salsa ensure integrity

242
00:10:00,899 --> 00:10:04,860
it does it by two basic pillars which I

243
00:10:04,860 --> 00:10:07,200
like to feed it as I as I like to view

244
00:10:07,200 --> 00:10:09,360
it the first one is attestation the

245
00:10:09,360 --> 00:10:11,940
other one is hardening

246
00:10:11,940 --> 00:10:15,120
so remember the problem that throughout

247
00:10:15,120 --> 00:10:17,160
our software development life cycle we

248
00:10:17,160 --> 00:10:20,399
had no way to communicate that hey or

249
00:10:20,399 --> 00:10:22,860
check that hey this is has this piece of

250
00:10:22,860 --> 00:10:24,480
software been tampered has some

251
00:10:24,480 --> 00:10:27,540
malicious actor been uh com has made it

252
00:10:27,540 --> 00:10:31,320
compromised so attestation using salsa

253
00:10:31,320 --> 00:10:34,560
and things it uh the checklist is

254
00:10:34,560 --> 00:10:37,320
provides to give attestation throughout

255
00:10:37,320 --> 00:10:39,480
that software development life cycle you

256
00:10:39,480 --> 00:10:41,399
can basically check that whether

257
00:10:41,399 --> 00:10:43,500
something has been tampered or not

258
00:10:43,500 --> 00:10:46,260
so throughout that life cycle it it's

259
00:10:46,260 --> 00:10:48,660
something some similar to a certificate

260
00:10:48,660 --> 00:10:53,220
is generated that that can be used to

261
00:10:53,220 --> 00:10:56,459
verify the Integrity of it and the salsa

262
00:10:56,459 --> 00:10:59,279
steps uh prepares your infrastructure

263
00:10:59,279 --> 00:11:00,720
for those

264
00:11:00,720 --> 00:11:03,000
um Integrity checks

265
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:06,060
the other part is the hardening so we

266
00:11:06,060 --> 00:11:07,740
are not just relying on the certificate

267
00:11:07,740 --> 00:11:10,500
but also the salsa Frameworks if you

268
00:11:10,500 --> 00:11:12,180
follow the different steps and the

269
00:11:12,180 --> 00:11:15,420
levels it will help your entire software

270
00:11:15,420 --> 00:11:18,000
development environment to be more

271
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:20,579
secure and resilient especially against

272
00:11:20,579 --> 00:11:22,200
tampering

273
00:11:22,200 --> 00:11:25,740
so what again the two ways salsa really

274
00:11:25,740 --> 00:11:28,459
provides value is that way of

275
00:11:28,459 --> 00:11:31,019
certificate generation and attestation

276
00:11:31,019 --> 00:11:33,060
and the other one is hardening the

277
00:11:33,060 --> 00:11:35,820
platform itself

278
00:11:35,820 --> 00:11:37,800
and

279
00:11:37,800 --> 00:11:40,140
the way you do it is by following the

280
00:11:40,140 --> 00:11:42,360
salsa levels so again remember the

281
00:11:42,360 --> 00:11:44,820
roadmap we spoke about that hey salsa

282
00:11:44,820 --> 00:11:46,320
provides you a roadmap to gradually

283
00:11:46,320 --> 00:11:49,019
improve it and these are the levels that

284
00:11:49,019 --> 00:11:51,899
form that road map so in level one you

285
00:11:51,899 --> 00:11:54,060
have more simple and easy to easily

286
00:11:54,060 --> 00:11:56,100
adoptable things to do and all the way

287
00:11:56,100 --> 00:11:58,320
to level four things get much more

288
00:11:58,320 --> 00:12:01,260
complex to implement but as you are

289
00:12:01,260 --> 00:12:02,579
climbing through the levels and

290
00:12:02,579 --> 00:12:04,500
implementing different things in salsa

291
00:12:04,500 --> 00:12:06,899
you're securing your supply chain more

292
00:12:06,899 --> 00:12:09,300
and more

293
00:12:09,300 --> 00:12:11,760
and if we look at the all the different

294
00:12:11,760 --> 00:12:14,640
things salsa provides you uh this

295
00:12:14,640 --> 00:12:16,680
lightning talk will become a full-blown

296
00:12:16,680 --> 00:12:19,200
boot camp honestly so we'll we won't get

297
00:12:19,200 --> 00:12:21,300
to cover every single aspect of it but

298
00:12:21,300 --> 00:12:24,060
we'll see how salsa provides the

299
00:12:24,060 --> 00:12:26,399
protection it's a different layer by

300
00:12:26,399 --> 00:12:28,800
some practical examples

301
00:12:28,800 --> 00:12:31,980
let's zoom into the source side so again

302
00:12:31,980 --> 00:12:35,459
this slide is very content heavy you I'm

303
00:12:35,459 --> 00:12:37,380
not expecting all of you to read it you

304
00:12:37,380 --> 00:12:39,839
can look these things up in the Salsa's

305
00:12:39,839 --> 00:12:42,420
website slsa.dev which I'll link after

306
00:12:42,420 --> 00:12:45,779
but this is to show that salsa provides

307
00:12:45,779 --> 00:12:50,040
you with actionable steps that help you

308
00:12:50,040 --> 00:12:52,920
climb the levels one by one

309
00:12:52,920 --> 00:12:55,740
and this is for things like source for

310
00:12:55,740 --> 00:12:57,540
your build your package and many other

311
00:12:57,540 --> 00:12:58,920
things

312
00:12:58,920 --> 00:13:01,860
but what exactly salsa is trying to

313
00:13:01,860 --> 00:13:03,120
achieve here

314
00:13:03,120 --> 00:13:05,579
if I try to distill that previous slide

315
00:13:05,579 --> 00:13:08,040
into this high level things what salsa

316
00:13:08,040 --> 00:13:12,300
is trying to do is establish a change uh

317
00:13:12,300 --> 00:13:14,700
his uh have a change history which we

318
00:13:14,700 --> 00:13:17,700
can then go and verify and validate so

319
00:13:17,700 --> 00:13:20,639
we can then go see at any point of time

320
00:13:20,639 --> 00:13:22,800
if anything has changed what has changed

321
00:13:22,800 --> 00:13:24,899
who changed and when

322
00:13:24,899 --> 00:13:28,079
similarly for source which is a lot of

323
00:13:28,079 --> 00:13:30,779
the case out the source code

324
00:13:30,779 --> 00:13:33,899
only trusted people can add and update

325
00:13:33,899 --> 00:13:35,760
the code so

326
00:13:35,760 --> 00:13:38,700
the higher you climb up in the levels of

327
00:13:38,700 --> 00:13:40,980
salsa the more authentication and

328
00:13:40,980 --> 00:13:43,079
authenticity you need to be able to add

329
00:13:43,079 --> 00:13:46,860
and remove code similarly unvetted code

330
00:13:46,860 --> 00:13:50,279
cannot reach the users so if you distill

331
00:13:50,279 --> 00:13:53,760
all those steps it just becomes to these

332
00:13:53,760 --> 00:13:55,680
three high level things that salsa is

333
00:13:55,680 --> 00:13:57,779
trying to help you achieve

334
00:13:57,779 --> 00:13:59,880
similarly let's have a look what are

335
00:13:59,880 --> 00:14:01,380
some of the things salsa is trying to do

336
00:14:01,380 --> 00:14:02,760
with build

337
00:14:02,760 --> 00:14:05,639
again it provides us with a lot of

338
00:14:05,639 --> 00:14:08,579
actionable items from making our builds

339
00:14:08,579 --> 00:14:11,880
scripted and automatic to hardening the

340
00:14:11,880 --> 00:14:14,220
build environment by making it more

341
00:14:14,220 --> 00:14:16,440
isolated short-lived and no internet

342
00:14:16,440 --> 00:14:19,079
access and different things and as you

343
00:14:19,079 --> 00:14:21,959
climb up the uh the ranks and the levels

344
00:14:21,959 --> 00:14:24,240
the harder and the stronger your

345
00:14:24,240 --> 00:14:26,940
environment becomes

346
00:14:26,940 --> 00:14:29,000
if we again distill those things

347
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:31,380
regarding the build salsa is just

348
00:14:31,380 --> 00:14:34,620
providing us these three key steps the

349
00:14:34,620 --> 00:14:36,300
first one is automating the build

350
00:14:36,300 --> 00:14:38,399
process so there is less scope of

351
00:14:38,399 --> 00:14:40,800
intervention and someone so someone can

352
00:14:40,800 --> 00:14:43,579
manually intervene and puts put in some

353
00:14:43,579 --> 00:14:47,100
malicious stuff and tamper with it and

354
00:14:47,100 --> 00:14:49,079
it's not just a build process salsa

355
00:14:49,079 --> 00:14:51,660
focuses on the environment as well so

356
00:14:51,660 --> 00:14:53,940
making the environment isolated from the

357
00:14:53,940 --> 00:14:55,740
internet making the environment

358
00:14:55,740 --> 00:14:58,260
short-lived and a few different other

359
00:14:58,260 --> 00:15:00,000
tactics you can really Harden the

360
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:01,860
environment where your software is being

361
00:15:01,860 --> 00:15:04,019
built and packaged

362
00:15:04,019 --> 00:15:07,019
and it's not just the hardening of the

363
00:15:07,019 --> 00:15:09,360
build process and the package if you

364
00:15:09,360 --> 00:15:11,579
follow the salsa steps and the checklist

365
00:15:11,579 --> 00:15:15,300
it gives you the ability to check your

366
00:15:15,300 --> 00:15:17,940
bills throughout that process what I

367
00:15:17,940 --> 00:15:20,040
mean by that is let's say you have made

368
00:15:20,040 --> 00:15:22,620
a build you can then programmatically or

369
00:15:22,620 --> 00:15:25,380
manually check is this the build that I

370
00:15:25,380 --> 00:15:28,500
was supposed to get did anyone manage to

371
00:15:28,500 --> 00:15:30,480
put in some malicious piece of code or

372
00:15:30,480 --> 00:15:32,220
any dependency or anything like that

373
00:15:32,220 --> 00:15:36,320
that can also be achieved

374
00:15:38,040 --> 00:15:40,980
and all these is uh done via something

375
00:15:40,980 --> 00:15:43,380
called the provenance the provenance

376
00:15:43,380 --> 00:15:46,500
allows you to verify all these things by

377
00:15:46,500 --> 00:15:49,320
giving you a Common Language to validate

378
00:15:49,320 --> 00:15:51,959
this externally and internally so what

379
00:15:51,959 --> 00:15:54,180
it means is we can tell to our customers

380
00:15:54,180 --> 00:15:56,399
that hey this is how we are doing salsa

381
00:15:56,399 --> 00:15:59,100
these are the different steps and this

382
00:15:59,100 --> 00:16:01,440
is this is actually what we're doing and

383
00:16:01,440 --> 00:16:03,480
it's not just about telling it they can

384
00:16:03,480 --> 00:16:05,639
also verify that the software you have

385
00:16:05,639 --> 00:16:08,579
created and the one they have is is the

386
00:16:08,579 --> 00:16:11,240
same one and how that's where when you

387
00:16:11,240 --> 00:16:13,860
achieve the things may have mentioned in

388
00:16:13,860 --> 00:16:16,199
the provenance section allows you to do

389
00:16:16,199 --> 00:16:18,720
that and it's not just for the customers

390
00:16:18,720 --> 00:16:22,019
we can also require salsa from our

391
00:16:22,019 --> 00:16:25,260
vendors we can ask the vendors to

392
00:16:25,260 --> 00:16:26,100
um

393
00:16:26,100 --> 00:16:28,920
for half certain salsa levels and they

394
00:16:28,920 --> 00:16:30,779
can show us on that they're maintaining

395
00:16:30,779 --> 00:16:33,600
it and we can go and verify it using the

396
00:16:33,600 --> 00:16:36,500
provenance rules

397
00:16:36,600 --> 00:16:37,800
so

398
00:16:37,800 --> 00:16:40,440
all these are great but salsa is not a

399
00:16:40,440 --> 00:16:42,420
silver bullet

400
00:16:42,420 --> 00:16:44,100
there are certain things salsa doesn't

401
00:16:44,100 --> 00:16:46,740
cover as well and I'll cover a couple of

402
00:16:46,740 --> 00:16:48,959
things I've I've talked about so far

403
00:16:48,959 --> 00:16:51,240
which is the source and build so if you

404
00:16:51,240 --> 00:16:54,839
have things like not following the the

405
00:16:54,839 --> 00:16:57,660
practice of least privilege or if you

406
00:16:57,660 --> 00:16:59,639
have vulnerabilities in your code salsa

407
00:16:59,639 --> 00:17:01,500
can really help with it

408
00:17:01,500 --> 00:17:03,779
similarly if the source control itself

409
00:17:03,779 --> 00:17:06,119
like git is compromised again that's not

410
00:17:06,119 --> 00:17:08,579
something salsa can help you with that's

411
00:17:08,579 --> 00:17:11,640
an additional thing you need to secure

412
00:17:11,640 --> 00:17:13,919
similarly with the build

413
00:17:13,919 --> 00:17:16,799
if your environment if you if you're not

414
00:17:16,799 --> 00:17:18,900
building from the secure environment and

415
00:17:18,900 --> 00:17:20,599
from somewhere else

416
00:17:20,599 --> 00:17:24,059
all this effort you've done it really

417
00:17:24,059 --> 00:17:26,040
becomes again fruitless

418
00:17:26,040 --> 00:17:29,520
similarly if build platforms like one or

419
00:17:29,520 --> 00:17:32,040
Travis Ci or GitHub or Docker or

420
00:17:32,040 --> 00:17:34,440
whatever it is has some issues again you

421
00:17:34,440 --> 00:17:36,480
that's something salsa can help with

422
00:17:36,480 --> 00:17:39,059
salsa is more focused on the tampering

423
00:17:39,059 --> 00:17:42,260
side and tampering only

424
00:17:42,539 --> 00:17:45,960
well that's all I get to cover in a

425
00:17:45,960 --> 00:17:48,120
lightning talk if you want to know salsa

426
00:17:48,120 --> 00:17:50,520
in depth and you want to figure out how

427
00:17:50,520 --> 00:17:52,620
to establish that in your company go to

428
00:17:52,620 --> 00:17:55,140
salsa.dev or just Google salsa framework

429
00:17:55,140 --> 00:17:57,480
you can also check out guac which is not

430
00:17:57,480 --> 00:17:59,880
a framework coming which pairs up nicely

431
00:17:59,880 --> 00:18:02,520
with salsa and I'll make one last

432
00:18:02,520 --> 00:18:05,039
Shameless plug to wrap up my talk like

433
00:18:05,039 --> 00:18:07,380
kavika mentioned I run a YouTube channel

434
00:18:07,380 --> 00:18:09,120
with a friend called Everything cyber

435
00:18:09,120 --> 00:18:11,039
where I create similar long and short

436
00:18:11,039 --> 00:18:12,840
form contents like this so things like

437
00:18:12,840 --> 00:18:14,700
Hands-On Labs thought experiments

438
00:18:14,700 --> 00:18:17,100
interviews with industry experts and

439
00:18:17,100 --> 00:18:19,679
much more you can find the Social Links

440
00:18:19,679 --> 00:18:21,360
for that as well as the links to that

441
00:18:21,360 --> 00:18:25,020
the slides both PDF and canva in this QR

442
00:18:25,020 --> 00:18:27,780
code thanks all from me um thank you for

443
00:18:27,780 --> 00:18:29,160
listening and if you have any questions

444
00:18:29,160 --> 00:18:32,760
feel free to ask them thanks

445
00:18:32,760 --> 00:18:34,679
amazing thank you so much for that okay

446
00:18:34,679 --> 00:18:36,780
if it was really I think salsa is one of

447
00:18:36,780 --> 00:18:37,919
those Frameworks I think you did a

448
00:18:37,919 --> 00:18:39,360
really good job of like breaking it down

449
00:18:39,360 --> 00:18:42,139
in 15 minutes

450
00:18:43,100 --> 00:18:45,539
document dedicated to that so but I

451
00:18:45,539 --> 00:18:46,860
think that was really well done and

452
00:18:46,860 --> 00:18:49,320
thank you a good mention for guac as

453
00:18:49,320 --> 00:18:50,400
well I don't know how far they're going

454
00:18:50,400 --> 00:18:55,380
to take the whole self and what yeah

455
00:18:56,340 --> 00:18:59,400
of it like all the names at least it's

456
00:18:59,400 --> 00:19:01,080
easy to remember right like we love our

457
00:19:01,080 --> 00:19:04,320
acronyms in uh cyber security uh I do

458
00:19:04,320 --> 00:19:06,480
have a problem here joining us as well

459
00:19:06,480 --> 00:19:08,820
so we previously obviously had uh kavika

460
00:19:08,820 --> 00:19:10,740
co-hosting with me and now I will have

461
00:19:10,740 --> 00:19:13,559
promo co-hosting the next hour with me

462
00:19:13,559 --> 00:19:15,419
uh but before anything just wanted to

463
00:19:15,419 --> 00:19:17,400
say thank you for the talk uh carefood

464
00:19:17,400 --> 00:19:19,200
was lovely having you on dev second we

465
00:19:19,200 --> 00:19:20,940
will move you to the back screen because

466
00:19:20,940 --> 00:19:22,919
we do have the next speaker the fun

467
00:19:22,919 --> 00:19:24,539
thing about lightning talks is you know

468
00:19:24,539 --> 00:19:25,919
they're quick and fast and you know they

469
00:19:25,919 --> 00:19:27,240
come really quickly but thank you so

470
00:19:27,240 --> 00:19:30,679
much for joining us thank you
