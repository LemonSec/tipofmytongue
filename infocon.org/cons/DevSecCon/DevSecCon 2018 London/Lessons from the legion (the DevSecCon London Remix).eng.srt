1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,449
also smart which we are I mean you've

2
00:00:01,920 --> 00:00:04,980
spent a couple of days together you know

3
00:00:03,449 --> 00:00:07,680
the level of intelligence in this

4
00:00:04,980 --> 00:00:09,420
industry if we're all working so hard

5
00:00:07,680 --> 00:00:11,610
he's waving

6
00:00:09,420 --> 00:00:17,460
paddy Sam is that a good thing or a bad

7
00:00:11,610 --> 00:00:20,220
thing to loud without me all this don't

8
00:00:17,460 --> 00:00:22,619
stand next to speaker we're all so smart

9
00:00:20,220 --> 00:00:24,710
like quite seriously incredibly smart

10
00:00:22,619 --> 00:00:28,920
industry all working so hard you know

11
00:00:24,710 --> 00:00:32,579
how hard you work in deficit Hobbs in

12
00:00:28,920 --> 00:00:35,399
cybersecurity why is everything so awful

13
00:00:32,579 --> 00:00:36,690
it's the question I have at the end of

14
00:00:35,399 --> 00:00:38,969
this expert you'll have questions as

15
00:00:36,690 --> 00:00:40,110
well I'll be available afterwards I'm

16
00:00:38,969 --> 00:00:42,629
sticking around for at least a couple of

17
00:00:40,110 --> 00:00:44,879
hours become my contact details we'll be

18
00:00:42,629 --> 00:00:46,559
at the end all references will be

19
00:00:44,879 --> 00:00:49,110
blogged I was hoping to do that in

20
00:00:46,559 --> 00:00:50,760
advance I will do that over this weekend

21
00:00:49,110 --> 00:00:52,949
of course it's being recorded and so on

22
00:00:50,760 --> 00:00:56,820
all media that I share his own is

23
00:00:52,949 --> 00:00:59,280
copyright if it's uncredited like this

24
00:00:56,820 --> 00:01:01,829
it's probably unless I've forgotten it's

25
00:00:59,280 --> 00:01:05,489
probably pixabay the wonderful online

26
00:01:01,829 --> 00:01:07,260
website so we've had a lot of technical

27
00:01:05,489 --> 00:01:10,320
talks over the last couple of days this

28
00:01:07,260 --> 00:01:12,630
is something different this talk is more

29
00:01:10,320 --> 00:01:14,729
of an investigation wall you're familiar

30
00:01:12,630 --> 00:01:17,548
with the idea you've seen the detective

31
00:01:14,729 --> 00:01:19,789
dramas the crime dramas the detective

32
00:01:17,549 --> 00:01:23,490
the investigator has a lot of ideas

33
00:01:19,790 --> 00:01:25,229
clippings photographs and long pieces of

34
00:01:23,490 --> 00:01:27,449
string sometimes between them trying to

35
00:01:25,229 --> 00:01:29,850
figure out the connection trying to

36
00:01:27,450 --> 00:01:33,240
figure out the mystery like I say why

37
00:01:29,850 --> 00:01:34,919
does everything feel so awful you are

38
00:01:33,240 --> 00:01:36,658
unfortunately some of you are going home

39
00:01:34,920 --> 00:01:39,270
none if you want to stand listen to me

40
00:01:36,659 --> 00:01:42,689
or weekend so this is a kind of part of

41
00:01:39,270 --> 00:01:45,000
that investigation wall a few ideas some

42
00:01:42,689 --> 00:01:47,720
long connections stringing together some

43
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:51,090
connections I'll explain really quickly

44
00:01:47,720 --> 00:01:52,560
and especially in this talk as opposed

45
00:01:51,090 --> 00:01:54,810
to some of the great technical talks

46
00:01:52,560 --> 00:01:56,969
we've had some seedlings

47
00:01:54,810 --> 00:01:59,250
I've got half an idea quarter an idea

48
00:01:56,969 --> 00:02:01,229
I'm not sure if it works I'm not sure if

49
00:01:59,250 --> 00:02:04,079
it makes sense I'm interested in what

50
00:02:01,229 --> 00:02:05,908
you think the way to start figured out

51
00:02:04,079 --> 00:02:09,329
this mystery are basically stolen some

52
00:02:05,909 --> 00:02:12,060
slides from john kinder vague field CTO

53
00:02:09,330 --> 00:02:12,900
of palo alto from his talk when the side

54
00:02:12,060 --> 00:02:14,970
wall with zero

55
00:02:12,900 --> 00:02:17,370
trust now if you look at that talk he

56
00:02:14,970 --> 00:02:20,099
describes the four levels of war the

57
00:02:17,370 --> 00:02:23,489
four levels in which you think your own

58
00:02:20,099 --> 00:02:26,129
strategy strategy tactics operations as

59
00:02:23,489 --> 00:02:28,470
you see there so there overall it's the

60
00:02:26,129 --> 00:02:29,489
ultimate goal the big idea the strategy

61
00:02:28,470 --> 00:02:31,709
of how you're going to achieve your

62
00:02:29,489 --> 00:02:34,170
ultimate goal which is usually win the

63
00:02:31,709 --> 00:02:35,909
war something like World War two tactics

64
00:02:34,170 --> 00:02:39,149
and operations the thing is things you

65
00:02:35,909 --> 00:02:41,519
use and the way you use them with all

66
00:02:39,150 --> 00:02:43,950
with all due respect to the technical

67
00:02:41,519 --> 00:02:46,829
tactical presenters we've had and you

68
00:02:43,950 --> 00:02:49,798
tend to have in other cyber security and

69
00:02:46,829 --> 00:02:52,920
developer orientated presentations those

70
00:02:49,799 --> 00:02:56,099
are very tactical ways of thinking there

71
00:02:52,920 --> 00:02:58,200
are very tactical solutions I think what

72
00:02:56,099 --> 00:03:01,319
we're missing in this industry is

73
00:02:58,200 --> 00:03:03,810
strategy it's thinking at that strategic

74
00:03:01,319 --> 00:03:06,179
level now I'm not sure about zero trust

75
00:03:03,810 --> 00:03:08,370
but I like from this talk that he thinks

76
00:03:06,180 --> 00:03:12,689
about cyber security at a strategic

77
00:03:08,370 --> 00:03:16,019
level he thinks about the big idea how

78
00:03:12,689 --> 00:03:18,358
do we make the whole thing work now to

79
00:03:16,019 --> 00:03:19,919
oversimplify incredibly quickly the

80
00:03:18,359 --> 00:03:22,680
tactics we have in this industry for

81
00:03:19,919 --> 00:03:25,709
everything you do system admin being a

82
00:03:22,680 --> 00:03:29,129
developer working security operations

83
00:03:25,709 --> 00:03:31,980
what do you do at the tactical level in

84
00:03:29,129 --> 00:03:33,629
your job I would say the way you are

85
00:03:31,980 --> 00:03:35,369
good at your job the way you are better

86
00:03:33,629 --> 00:03:38,040
at the job the way you're ranked against

87
00:03:35,370 --> 00:03:39,959
everybody else is your individual level

88
00:03:38,040 --> 00:03:42,510
of skill something you hear in this

89
00:03:39,959 --> 00:03:44,280
industry a lot which means different

90
00:03:42,510 --> 00:03:47,159
things to different people is passion

91
00:03:44,280 --> 00:03:49,319
it's all about long hours you and your

92
00:03:47,159 --> 00:03:51,030
laptop you're better than someone else

93
00:03:49,319 --> 00:03:52,948
because you spend longer doing it you're

94
00:03:51,030 --> 00:03:55,859
better than someone else because you are

95
00:03:52,949 --> 00:03:58,889
better that's it you know more code you

96
00:03:55,859 --> 00:04:02,849
can code faster it's your individual

97
00:03:58,889 --> 00:04:05,220
level of skill and attitude now

98
00:04:02,849 --> 00:04:07,198
especially for the deficit Kahn remix of

99
00:04:05,220 --> 00:04:10,260
this talk to stretch in an analysis to

100
00:04:07,199 --> 00:04:12,060
stretch an analogy maybe too far I'm

101
00:04:10,260 --> 00:04:15,840
interested in your feedback afterwards

102
00:04:12,060 --> 00:04:18,780
your processes your automation as well I

103
00:04:15,840 --> 00:04:21,510
would say is the same thing it's about

104
00:04:18,779 --> 00:04:23,909
making your process absolutely as hard

105
00:04:21,510 --> 00:04:25,250
as it can be absolutely as fast as it

106
00:04:23,909 --> 00:04:28,460
can be the best

107
00:04:25,250 --> 00:04:31,010
the best automated process the best

108
00:04:28,460 --> 00:04:34,039
docker container the best application

109
00:04:31,010 --> 00:04:36,110
standing on its own so that is our

110
00:04:34,040 --> 00:04:38,930
tactical and therefore strategic

111
00:04:36,110 --> 00:04:41,420
approach to cybersecurity where is that

112
00:04:38,930 --> 00:04:43,850
goddess when I started doing versions of

113
00:04:41,420 --> 00:04:45,290
this talk three months ago data breach

114
00:04:43,850 --> 00:04:48,440
statistics according to breach level

115
00:04:45,290 --> 00:04:51,500
index since 2013 that's almost 10

116
00:04:48,440 --> 00:04:54,500
billion data records stolen look to the

117
00:04:51,500 --> 00:04:56,270
website again a week or so ago with just

118
00:04:54,500 --> 00:04:59,540
over 14 and a half billion records

119
00:04:56,270 --> 00:05:03,530
stolen you look at a blog post by rapid7

120
00:04:59,540 --> 00:05:06,230
around April of this year looking by CVS

121
00:05:03,530 --> 00:05:08,150
it's not quite exponential but just more

122
00:05:06,230 --> 00:05:10,820
and more CVS and they described it as

123
00:05:08,150 --> 00:05:14,150
being by the heavy hitters the same

124
00:05:10,820 --> 00:05:16,010
companies the same kind of cv ease over

125
00:05:14,150 --> 00:05:18,620
and over again you look at the World

126
00:05:16,010 --> 00:05:22,719
Economic Forum's Global Risk report for

127
00:05:18,620 --> 00:05:25,820
2018 so risks to civilization as a whole

128
00:05:22,720 --> 00:05:27,020
up there in the top right you've got

129
00:05:25,820 --> 00:05:29,659
climate change

130
00:05:27,020 --> 00:05:33,080
you've got global weather events so

131
00:05:29,660 --> 00:05:36,110
thousands of years effect on nature of

132
00:05:33,080 --> 00:05:39,200
nature represents the cross-reference of

133
00:05:36,110 --> 00:05:41,750
likelihood to him back impact at the top

134
00:05:39,200 --> 00:05:45,919
right cybersecurity we've been around

135
00:05:41,750 --> 00:05:48,250
like 4050 years we're there so that's

136
00:05:45,919 --> 00:05:54,200
where her tactics have got us

137
00:05:48,250 --> 00:05:56,950
well done everyone so why so I'll hide

138
00:05:54,200 --> 00:05:59,900
behind the podium when I say that so and

139
00:05:56,950 --> 00:06:02,960
this reminds me of something that

140
00:05:59,900 --> 00:06:06,200
tactical approach how can I be the best

141
00:06:02,960 --> 00:06:09,799
cyber security practitioner it reminds

142
00:06:06,200 --> 00:06:11,479
me of this so we're gonna work through

143
00:06:09,800 --> 00:06:14,000
the same drill get into the same

144
00:06:11,479 --> 00:06:15,710
position and from here we're hitting the

145
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:18,820
putts so solid that's the biggest

146
00:06:15,710 --> 00:06:18,820
difference that I've seen

147
00:06:28,070 --> 00:06:36,800
does this feel like your day job the way

148
00:06:32,960 --> 00:06:39,710
we practice like golf it's you you're

149
00:06:36,800 --> 00:06:44,420
tall it's the static environment be the

150
00:06:39,710 --> 00:06:48,080
best golfer you can be when you play

151
00:06:44,420 --> 00:06:49,820
golf it's essentially this except

152
00:06:48,080 --> 00:06:51,830
there's some people watching your

153
00:06:49,820 --> 00:06:55,790
teammates are encouraging you but not

154
00:06:51,830 --> 00:06:57,109
helping the field still stay static your

155
00:06:55,790 --> 00:06:59,750
teammates don't help you the hole

156
00:06:57,110 --> 00:07:02,050
doesn't move you adversaries the

157
00:06:59,750 --> 00:07:05,660
opposing team or the opposing player is

158
00:07:02,050 --> 00:07:07,130
watching and then they go and try to be

159
00:07:05,660 --> 00:07:08,570
the best golfer they can be they're not

160
00:07:07,130 --> 00:07:10,520
going to move the hole they're not going

161
00:07:08,570 --> 00:07:11,810
to try and start a weather storm they're

162
00:07:10,520 --> 00:07:13,130
not gonna attack you they're not gonna

163
00:07:11,810 --> 00:07:15,110
throw a golf ball at you they're not

164
00:07:13,130 --> 00:07:18,469
gonna throw a club at you and so on

165
00:07:15,110 --> 00:07:21,530
that's where that's so doing like that

166
00:07:18,470 --> 00:07:23,060
is fine you might be asking what's wrong

167
00:07:21,530 --> 00:07:26,570
with golf there's nothing wrong with

168
00:07:23,060 --> 00:07:30,560
golf there's nothing for there's no

169
00:07:26,570 --> 00:07:33,260
problem for training for golf if you're

170
00:07:30,560 --> 00:07:36,020
going to play golf you look that happy

171
00:07:33,260 --> 00:07:38,800
if you've trained for golf and you play

172
00:07:36,020 --> 00:07:43,400
golf well I think we've got golf like

173
00:07:38,800 --> 00:07:45,950
tactics it's be the best cybersecurity

174
00:07:43,400 --> 00:07:47,719
practitioner I can be which is somehow

175
00:07:45,950 --> 00:07:51,159
then created like the emergent strategy

176
00:07:47,720 --> 00:07:54,950
of be the best cybersecurity

177
00:07:51,160 --> 00:07:57,320
practitioner I can be but I think we're

178
00:07:54,950 --> 00:08:00,080
trying to play conceptually the wrong

179
00:07:57,320 --> 00:08:01,880
sport now the long if anybody wants to

180
00:08:00,080 --> 00:08:03,289
stick around for the weekend version

181
00:08:01,880 --> 00:08:05,510
long weekend long version of this

182
00:08:03,290 --> 00:08:07,250
presentation goes into a lot about

183
00:08:05,510 --> 00:08:09,530
analogical thinking and different

184
00:08:07,250 --> 00:08:11,210
comparisons and so on but to justify

185
00:08:09,530 --> 00:08:14,869
that I'll just use one and out one

186
00:08:11,210 --> 00:08:17,090
example trees which is an acronym for

187
00:08:14,870 --> 00:08:19,580
whatever's Russian for the theory of

188
00:08:17,090 --> 00:08:22,010
inventive problem-solving invented in

189
00:08:19,580 --> 00:08:24,620
the 1950s by an inventive stroke science

190
00:08:22,010 --> 00:08:26,980
fiction author in Soviet Russia in

191
00:08:24,620 --> 00:08:29,900
unfortunate I think Stalin's gulags

192
00:08:26,980 --> 00:08:31,610
where he looked at inventions and the

193
00:08:29,900 --> 00:08:33,968
problems they solved and the

194
00:08:31,610 --> 00:08:35,990
characteristics of those problems and

195
00:08:33,969 --> 00:08:39,089
then he looked at the patterns in the

196
00:08:35,990 --> 00:08:41,729
solutions so sort of

197
00:08:39,089 --> 00:08:44,579
conceptually the kind of solution to

198
00:08:41,729 --> 00:08:46,350
solve a conceptual problem and he looked

199
00:08:44,579 --> 00:08:49,109
with a sufficient level of abstraction

200
00:08:46,350 --> 00:08:51,120
you can use other people's conceptual

201
00:08:49,110 --> 00:08:53,879
solutions to solve your problem if

202
00:08:51,120 --> 00:08:57,389
someone needs twice as much power from a

203
00:08:53,879 --> 00:08:59,430
power source but can't have that power

204
00:08:57,389 --> 00:09:00,600
source be twice as heavy people will

205
00:08:59,430 --> 00:09:03,300
have solved that in other engineering

206
00:09:00,600 --> 00:09:05,999
disciplines so you just look at the

207
00:09:03,300 --> 00:09:07,849
overall conceptual method they used and

208
00:09:05,999 --> 00:09:10,680
then you use it yourself

209
00:09:07,850 --> 00:09:12,029
now trees is really complicated be

210
00:09:10,680 --> 00:09:14,519
honest I've done a little bit of reading

211
00:09:12,029 --> 00:09:16,139
the Wikipedia page there's like 40

212
00:09:14,519 --> 00:09:17,939
principles of trees it looks really

213
00:09:16,139 --> 00:09:20,160
interesting I really like the idea of it

214
00:09:17,939 --> 00:09:22,680
as an engineering shortcut but I also

215
00:09:20,160 --> 00:09:24,389
like the overall analogy you've got your

216
00:09:22,680 --> 00:09:26,040
problem traditional approach you just

217
00:09:24,389 --> 00:09:28,519
keep thinking about your problem in your

218
00:09:26,040 --> 00:09:31,889
context and you get to a solution

219
00:09:28,519 --> 00:09:34,889
instead look at the conceptual problems

220
00:09:31,889 --> 00:09:37,050
in the world that are like yours look at

221
00:09:34,889 --> 00:09:39,120
how people have solved those problems

222
00:09:37,050 --> 00:09:42,660
stop trying to bang your head through

223
00:09:39,120 --> 00:09:44,970
that wall and overall I to be honest I

224
00:09:42,660 --> 00:09:47,519
don't know if it's age identif it's the

225
00:09:44,970 --> 00:09:49,649
people I know in the industry I think as

226
00:09:47,519 --> 00:09:51,269
an industry as a whole we're what's

227
00:09:49,649 --> 00:09:52,559
called E and I think management

228
00:09:51,269 --> 00:09:54,870
consultancy business management a

229
00:09:52,559 --> 00:09:57,209
strategic inflection point we either

230
00:09:54,870 --> 00:09:59,790
keep trying to do what we do in harder

231
00:09:57,209 --> 00:10:02,399
and harder and profit declines or you

232
00:09:59,790 --> 00:10:04,050
change the way you work and things get

233
00:10:02,399 --> 00:10:06,629
better but the way you're doing it just

234
00:10:04,050 --> 00:10:08,849
won't work anymore because the situation

235
00:10:06,629 --> 00:10:10,319
you're in has changed again literally

236
00:10:08,850 --> 00:10:12,689
like I've read a couple of articles in a

237
00:10:10,319 --> 00:10:14,459
Wikipedia page I think we need to jump

238
00:10:12,689 --> 00:10:17,279
from one s-curve to another

239
00:10:14,459 --> 00:10:19,050
we've put where we put more and more

240
00:10:17,279 --> 00:10:21,420
effort and we get less and less out of

241
00:10:19,050 --> 00:10:24,899
it we need a different way of thinking

242
00:10:21,420 --> 00:10:27,319
in this industry because if we were

243
00:10:24,899 --> 00:10:29,309
playing golf we would look like that

244
00:10:27,319 --> 00:10:31,410
it's a bit of an oversimplification

245
00:10:29,309 --> 00:10:35,129
there's nuance to this argument but in

246
00:10:31,410 --> 00:10:37,219
cybersecurity we look like this and also

247
00:10:35,129 --> 00:10:39,929
again stretching the analogy our

248
00:10:37,220 --> 00:10:41,540
applications look like this as software

249
00:10:39,929 --> 00:10:43,829
looks like they say our infrastructure

250
00:10:41,540 --> 00:10:46,050
looks like this it's out on its own

251
00:10:43,829 --> 00:10:48,660
right we've made you as hard as possible

252
00:10:46,050 --> 00:10:51,059
that's it be the best golfer you can be

253
00:10:48,660 --> 00:10:52,240
independently that's not the environment

254
00:10:51,059 --> 00:10:56,079
we're in

255
00:10:52,240 --> 00:10:57,339
so think about your what your process is

256
00:10:56,079 --> 00:10:59,349
go under think about what your

257
00:10:57,339 --> 00:11:00,790
infrastructure the context your

258
00:10:59,350 --> 00:11:01,869
infrastructure is in but also think

259
00:11:00,790 --> 00:11:03,849
about your day jobs

260
00:11:01,869 --> 00:11:06,309
think about the calls you've taken today

261
00:11:03,850 --> 00:11:07,899
what was happening earlier this week the

262
00:11:06,309 --> 00:11:10,089
size of your inbox you're looking

263
00:11:07,899 --> 00:11:11,649
forward to either on Saturday morning or

264
00:11:10,089 --> 00:11:14,290
Monday morning think about your

265
00:11:11,649 --> 00:11:17,529
colleagues think about your managers

266
00:11:14,290 --> 00:11:21,160
also think about your adversaries

267
00:11:17,529 --> 00:11:26,939
I think your situation our situation

268
00:11:21,160 --> 00:11:26,939
looks sounds and feels much more like

269
00:11:28,660 --> 00:11:32,410
[Applause]

270
00:11:34,600 --> 00:11:43,290
[Applause]

kill turbo suck away the Patriots

277
00:11:57,609 --> 00:12:04,029
dropped into coverage in this play this

278
00:12:01,540 --> 00:12:06,650
is a form of a combination coverage you

279
00:12:04,029 --> 00:12:12,039
have to be kidding me that is impossible

280
00:12:06,650 --> 00:12:12,039
[Applause]

281
00:12:12,480 --> 00:12:32,589
we know assignments we know our limits

282
00:12:18,569 --> 00:12:34,059
we know our schemes now hopefully I

283
00:12:32,589 --> 00:12:36,220
don't know maybe hopefully everybody's

284
00:12:34,059 --> 00:12:37,779
had a beer or two from downstairs

285
00:12:36,220 --> 00:12:40,419
whatever I realized this is a stretch

286
00:12:37,779 --> 00:12:43,089
but also I think I'm really on to

287
00:12:40,419 --> 00:12:45,399
something so security in general the

288
00:12:43,089 --> 00:12:47,589
chaos of cybersecurity is a lot like

289
00:12:45,399 --> 00:12:49,749
American football especially for

290
00:12:47,589 --> 00:12:50,889
professional American football some of

291
00:12:49,749 --> 00:12:52,829
you I don't know with some of the

292
00:12:50,889 --> 00:12:55,179
lighting it's hard to tell

293
00:12:52,829 --> 00:12:57,279
utterly incomprehensible from the

294
00:12:55,179 --> 00:12:59,350
outside talking to your relatives

295
00:12:57,279 --> 00:13:03,189
talking to your non-technical friends

296
00:12:59,350 --> 00:13:06,220
what we do makes conceptually absolutely

297
00:13:03,189 --> 00:13:09,160
no sense at all you watch a game of

298
00:13:06,220 --> 00:13:11,019
american football they all line up they

299
00:13:09,160 --> 00:13:12,790
all wait something happens lots of

300
00:13:11,019 --> 00:13:15,249
people run into each other I think maybe

301
00:13:12,790 --> 00:13:17,498
it's a fight then they all stop then

302
00:13:15,249 --> 00:13:20,079
like entire teams seem to go off and

303
00:13:17,499 --> 00:13:22,059
come on makes absolutely no sense both

304
00:13:20,079 --> 00:13:24,579
are absolutely defined by their

305
00:13:22,059 --> 00:13:27,249
complexity also something I don't have

306
00:13:24,579 --> 00:13:29,649
time to expand on their team games the

307
00:13:27,249 --> 00:13:32,049
people you work with the people you work

308
00:13:29,649 --> 00:13:34,540
against it's something the way we

309
00:13:32,049 --> 00:13:37,480
practice completely misses this is not

310
00:13:34,540 --> 00:13:41,019
golf also it's fantastically highly

311
00:13:37,480 --> 00:13:42,669
specialized in both both areas that's

312
00:13:41,019 --> 00:13:44,019
why in American football so many players

313
00:13:42,669 --> 00:13:46,419
go on and off the field that's where the

314
00:13:44,019 --> 00:13:48,639
teams are so big in our profession it's

315
00:13:46,419 --> 00:13:50,860
the same way their specialization by

316
00:13:48,639 --> 00:13:52,449
situation and if you're attacking or

317
00:13:50,860 --> 00:13:55,539
defending with American football whether

318
00:13:52,449 --> 00:13:58,269
your team has got the ball or not also

319
00:13:55,539 --> 00:14:00,879
when it's a fight over territory more so

320
00:13:58,269 --> 00:14:03,399
than any other sport also more so than

321
00:14:00,879 --> 00:14:05,799
the others for offensive and defensive

322
00:14:03,399 --> 00:14:09,249
play books literally the same

323
00:14:05,799 --> 00:14:10,869
terminology that we use I mean to rate

324
00:14:09,249 --> 00:14:12,549
instant response play books and so on

325
00:14:10,869 --> 00:14:14,579
also the same terminology the same

326
00:14:12,549 --> 00:14:18,449
philosophy the same methodology as

327
00:14:14,579 --> 00:14:21,609
conflict as a traditional military

328
00:14:18,449 --> 00:14:23,378
kinetic conflict I think also there's a

329
00:14:21,610 --> 00:14:24,499
lot to learn from the military there's a

330
00:14:23,379 --> 00:14:26,479
lot to learn from them with regard

331
00:14:24,499 --> 00:14:28,159
to logistics tragedy tactics and so on

332
00:14:26,479 --> 00:14:31,179
I'll be bringing that in a little

333
00:14:28,159 --> 00:14:33,979
especially wargaming war studies

334
00:14:31,179 --> 00:14:35,839
military modeling there's a lot that we

335
00:14:33,979 --> 00:14:39,259
can learn from that and apply to our

336
00:14:35,839 --> 00:14:41,149
industry so what can we learn from

337
00:14:39,259 --> 00:14:43,039
football and more importantly who can we

338
00:14:41,149 --> 00:14:44,779
learn it from as I said with trees find

339
00:14:43,039 --> 00:14:46,759
someone who solved that problem already

340
00:14:44,779 --> 00:14:49,249
who's best in this weird complex

341
00:14:46,759 --> 00:14:51,739
situation now an American football team

342
00:14:49,249 --> 00:14:53,239
is so big you've got so many players as

343
00:14:51,739 --> 00:14:54,469
they say you've got an offense the team

344
00:14:53,239 --> 00:14:56,479
that comes on the field when you've got

345
00:14:54,469 --> 00:14:58,369
the ball the defense the team that comes

346
00:14:56,479 --> 00:15:00,169
on the field when you don't so I think

347
00:14:58,369 --> 00:15:02,539
we should pick a defense because we're

348
00:15:00,169 --> 00:15:04,579
defenders I think we should learn from

349
00:15:02,539 --> 00:15:06,348
arguably the best defense therefore I

350
00:15:04,579 --> 00:15:09,169
think the Legion of boom the name of the

351
00:15:06,349 --> 00:15:12,289
Seattle Seahawks defense from 2011 to

352
00:15:09,169 --> 00:15:15,109
2017 mainly its cornerback Richard

353
00:15:12,289 --> 00:15:17,718
Sherman free safety free safety Earl

354
00:15:15,109 --> 00:15:19,039
Thomas and strong safety camp Chancellor

355
00:15:17,719 --> 00:15:21,199
but the term kind of encompassed

356
00:15:19,039 --> 00:15:23,749
everyone over this time because from

357
00:15:21,199 --> 00:15:26,179
2012 to 2015 the whole point of an

358
00:15:23,749 --> 00:15:28,819
American football defense is stop your

359
00:15:26,179 --> 00:15:30,559
opponent's scoring points the best team

360
00:15:28,819 --> 00:15:32,659
for that for four years straight which

361
00:15:30,559 --> 00:15:35,089
is an NFL record was the Seattle

362
00:15:32,659 --> 00:15:36,649
Seahawks team now unfortunately the guy

363
00:15:35,089 --> 00:15:38,539
in the packager I think he's downstairs

364
00:15:36,649 --> 00:15:40,489
I know there's a damn Patriots fan

365
00:15:38,539 --> 00:15:42,199
around here somewhere and I see a few

366
00:15:40,489 --> 00:15:43,909
knowing smiles around the crowd so

367
00:15:42,199 --> 00:15:47,269
there's lots of other sports arguments

368
00:15:43,909 --> 00:15:48,589
glad to have them later but for now what

369
00:15:47,269 --> 00:15:50,899
can the Seahawks teachers and the

370
00:15:48,589 --> 00:15:52,729
philosophy of their head coach Pete

371
00:15:50,899 --> 00:15:55,489
Carroll in your terms

372
00:15:52,729 --> 00:15:58,159
the first lesson to take from him is

373
00:15:55,489 --> 00:16:01,609
what we would call shift left your

374
00:15:58,159 --> 00:16:03,919
conflict for Pete Carroll it's practice

375
00:16:01,609 --> 00:16:06,319
is everything part of his overall

376
00:16:03,919 --> 00:16:08,569
philosophy win forever which is

377
00:16:06,319 --> 00:16:12,858
literally what we want to do in

378
00:16:08,569 --> 00:16:15,049
cybersecurity his practice is everything

379
00:16:12,859 --> 00:16:19,369
practices as important as playing the

380
00:16:15,049 --> 00:16:21,169
game because the thing is an NFL team is

381
00:16:19,369 --> 00:16:23,029
so big these all the players listed in

382
00:16:21,169 --> 00:16:25,819
white that you've got a first string and

383
00:16:23,029 --> 00:16:27,439
second-string team here which means your

384
00:16:25,819 --> 00:16:29,089
second string offer your second string

385
00:16:27,439 --> 00:16:31,129
defense can play your first string

386
00:16:29,089 --> 00:16:32,899
offense and your second string offerings

387
00:16:31,129 --> 00:16:34,970
can play your first string defense and

388
00:16:32,899 --> 00:16:37,429
that means your second string squads can

389
00:16:34,970 --> 00:16:38,060
imitate whichever team you're due to

390
00:16:37,429 --> 00:16:40,280
play that

391
00:16:38,060 --> 00:16:41,869
the idea of a scout team so you're up

392
00:16:40,280 --> 00:16:43,850
against the Oakland Raiders on Sunday

393
00:16:41,870 --> 00:16:45,410
you wear their shirt numbers maybe even

394
00:16:43,850 --> 00:16:47,660
go as far as wearing their uniforms you

395
00:16:45,410 --> 00:16:49,400
use their plays you use their play calls

396
00:16:47,660 --> 00:16:51,290
you use their formations you try and

397
00:16:49,400 --> 00:16:52,790
imitate them so by the time you're

398
00:16:51,290 --> 00:16:54,500
playing the Oakland Raiders on Sunday

399
00:16:52,790 --> 00:16:56,599
this is not the first time you've played

400
00:16:54,500 --> 00:16:58,760
the Oakland Raiders as well as study and

401
00:16:56,600 --> 00:17:00,770
film you've played against them for the

402
00:16:58,760 --> 00:17:03,380
last six days so it's just a

403
00:17:00,770 --> 00:17:06,040
continuation of what you do and that

404
00:17:03,380 --> 00:17:09,020
this brings me to a concept from

405
00:17:06,040 --> 00:17:10,819
military studies a concept that this is

406
00:17:09,020 --> 00:17:12,980
literally the only slide on the internet

407
00:17:10,819 --> 00:17:15,050
that I'm hoping to make much more known

408
00:17:12,980 --> 00:17:16,970
because it's from Matt Caffrey is called

409
00:17:15,050 --> 00:17:19,280
the Caffrey triangle there's been

410
00:17:16,970 --> 00:17:22,250
studying wargaming for like 3040 years

411
00:17:19,280 --> 00:17:24,170
in military simulations the problem they

412
00:17:22,250 --> 00:17:27,050
have with a military red force someone

413
00:17:24,170 --> 00:17:29,540
running the exercise is they'll be down

414
00:17:27,050 --> 00:17:32,419
here in this triangle stimulate the game

415
00:17:29,540 --> 00:17:33,860
objectives completely basically we

416
00:17:32,420 --> 00:17:34,340
bought some new tanks make them look

417
00:17:33,860 --> 00:17:37,129
good

418
00:17:34,340 --> 00:17:38,389
Dyanne command justify the three hundred

419
00:17:37,130 --> 00:17:40,600
billion dollars three hundred million

420
00:17:38,390 --> 00:17:42,920
dollars we spent on an aircraft carrier

421
00:17:40,600 --> 00:17:45,679
penetration testers cyber security

422
00:17:42,920 --> 00:17:47,300
practitioners as part of a red team as

423
00:17:45,680 --> 00:17:50,660
part of a red force in general or

424
00:17:47,300 --> 00:17:54,620
arguably up here win at all costs show

425
00:17:50,660 --> 00:17:57,200
all possible vulnerabilities it's the

426
00:17:54,620 --> 00:17:58,820
way penetration test is the way they try

427
00:17:57,200 --> 00:18:02,560
to be when actually I think what we need

428
00:17:58,820 --> 00:18:04,669
is down here much more follow doctrine

429
00:18:02,560 --> 00:18:06,200
imitate your opponent's because your

430
00:18:04,670 --> 00:18:07,610
opponents are the ones you're going to

431
00:18:06,200 --> 00:18:09,830
face it's not like American football

432
00:18:07,610 --> 00:18:14,139
it's a single team but you know it's a

433
00:18:09,830 --> 00:18:17,330
bunch of adversary's with a set of TTP's

434
00:18:14,140 --> 00:18:18,560
techniques tactics procedures that's who

435
00:18:17,330 --> 00:18:21,110
you're up against you're not up against

436
00:18:18,560 --> 00:18:24,020
everything k14 up against everyone

437
00:18:21,110 --> 00:18:27,139
capable of everything which reminds me

438
00:18:24,020 --> 00:18:29,780
of course of Adam Shostak presentation

439
00:18:27,140 --> 00:18:31,940
he gave our brew con and he said one of

440
00:18:29,780 --> 00:18:34,070
the many traps he listed with regard to

441
00:18:31,940 --> 00:18:36,830
threat modeling which is essentially

442
00:18:34,070 --> 00:18:39,169
automated or manual practice against

443
00:18:36,830 --> 00:18:41,659
your systems is doing it at the wrong

444
00:18:39,170 --> 00:18:44,480
time for a Pete Carril point of view

445
00:18:41,660 --> 00:18:47,510
practices like the game you practice is

446
00:18:44,480 --> 00:18:49,190
hard you hit each other as hard you hit

447
00:18:47,510 --> 00:18:50,990
your own team as hard because and

448
00:18:49,190 --> 00:18:51,460
everybody gets better you be the best

449
00:18:50,990 --> 00:18:53,409
player

450
00:18:51,460 --> 00:18:54,880
can so your teammate can be the best

451
00:18:53,409 --> 00:18:56,799
they can so you have to get rid of said

452
00:18:54,880 --> 00:18:58,960
they have to get better in the same area

453
00:18:56,799 --> 00:19:01,779
with threat modeling start right at the

454
00:18:58,960 --> 00:19:03,909
beginning you do it you know completely

455
00:19:01,779 --> 00:19:07,750
shift left I mean the presentation we

456
00:19:03,909 --> 00:19:09,850
had yesterday Stewart Stewart showing we

457
00:19:07,750 --> 00:19:12,220
can do this at speed and scale it's not

458
00:19:09,850 --> 00:19:14,620
easy but we can make such a difference

459
00:19:12,220 --> 00:19:15,970
if you shift left and this is what

460
00:19:14,620 --> 00:19:18,250
everybody else does this is our

461
00:19:15,970 --> 00:19:20,919
military's train this is how sports

462
00:19:18,250 --> 00:19:24,159
teams practice it should naturally come

463
00:19:20,919 --> 00:19:27,220
to a set of people in that kind of

464
00:19:24,159 --> 00:19:28,539
conflict situation now how do we define

465
00:19:27,220 --> 00:19:30,039
this kind of threat modeling there's a

466
00:19:28,539 --> 00:19:32,158
good presentation you should watch from

467
00:19:30,039 --> 00:19:35,760
besides Las Vegas earlier this year

468
00:19:32,159 --> 00:19:38,289
might is describing their attack

469
00:19:35,760 --> 00:19:41,010
framework which stands for adversarial

470
00:19:38,289 --> 00:19:44,950
tactics techniques and common knowledge

471
00:19:41,010 --> 00:19:47,890
by Katie Nichols and John Wanda and what

472
00:19:44,950 --> 00:19:51,750
they say there what the attack framework

473
00:19:47,890 --> 00:19:54,970
gives you is the language to communicate

474
00:19:51,750 --> 00:19:57,100
TTP's and behaviors you can describe how

475
00:19:54,970 --> 00:19:59,200
your opponents think and what they do

476
00:19:57,100 --> 00:20:00,789
conceptually it's not just IO C's it's

477
00:19:59,200 --> 00:20:03,220
not just IP addresses it's not just

478
00:20:00,789 --> 00:20:05,620
hashes it's actually the way they go

479
00:20:03,220 --> 00:20:08,289
against you so it allows us to compare

480
00:20:05,620 --> 00:20:11,049
groups it gives us a common language now

481
00:20:08,289 --> 00:20:12,820
this is a long string across my

482
00:20:11,049 --> 00:20:16,450
investigation world this reminds me of

483
00:20:12,820 --> 00:20:19,360
the rand report from 1991 the base of

484
00:20:16,450 --> 00:20:21,580
sand problem really interesting report

485
00:20:19,360 --> 00:20:23,620
basically military modelers war gamers

486
00:20:21,580 --> 00:20:26,350
simulators people as part of that

487
00:20:23,620 --> 00:20:28,418
billion dollar industry looked at their

488
00:20:26,350 --> 00:20:30,639
entire industry their analyzed military

489
00:20:28,419 --> 00:20:34,570
affairs and basically said we're all

490
00:20:30,640 --> 00:20:36,340
doing it wrong I had the guts and the

491
00:20:34,570 --> 00:20:37,779
courage to say we're focusing on the

492
00:20:36,340 --> 00:20:40,209
wrong things we're being too much

493
00:20:37,779 --> 00:20:43,260
focused on technology too much on

494
00:20:40,210 --> 00:20:45,190
statistics not enough on concepts a

495
00:20:43,260 --> 00:20:47,919
great example from this and I'm

496
00:20:45,190 --> 00:20:49,570
paraphrasing is this footnote which says

497
00:20:47,919 --> 00:20:51,940
battle outcomes have historically borne

498
00:20:49,570 --> 00:20:53,649
no relationship to the raw force ratio

499
00:20:51,940 --> 00:20:55,029
it's not just who's got the biggest army

500
00:20:53,649 --> 00:20:57,489
it's not just who's got the most

501
00:20:55,029 --> 00:21:00,070
resources what matters is the ratio of

502
00:20:57,490 --> 00:21:02,950
effective forces it's getting the right

503
00:21:00,070 --> 00:21:04,779
people in the right place so another

504
00:21:02,950 --> 00:21:05,299
long string Jeremiah Grossman tweet

505
00:21:04,779 --> 00:21:07,700
about this

506
00:21:05,299 --> 00:21:11,090
this year the kennel security report of

507
00:21:07,700 --> 00:21:14,090
all funner abilities as a percentage 2%

508
00:21:11,090 --> 00:21:15,860
are being exploited why try and fix a

509
00:21:14,090 --> 00:21:18,080
hundred percent of issues I mean as per

510
00:21:15,860 --> 00:21:21,019
their tour yesterday why try and fix all

511
00:21:18,080 --> 00:21:23,360
the issues when only 2% of vulnerable

512
00:21:21,019 --> 00:21:25,159
your waste in I mean it doesn't quite

513
00:21:23,360 --> 00:21:27,559
match proportionally with 98% of your

514
00:21:25,159 --> 00:21:28,789
resource effectively this blog from

515
00:21:27,559 --> 00:21:30,830
Jeremiah all these vulnerabilities

516
00:21:28,789 --> 00:21:33,200
rarely matter is a nice explanation of

517
00:21:30,830 --> 00:21:34,879
the thinking behind that so that's

518
00:21:33,200 --> 00:21:36,909
something we need to learn is practice

519
00:21:34,879 --> 00:21:39,769
is everything shift left I mean in you

520
00:21:36,909 --> 00:21:41,720
we've got so many people to discuss the

521
00:21:39,769 --> 00:21:45,039
threat modeling with today I think that

522
00:21:41,720 --> 00:21:47,690
is so important and there's an analogy

523
00:21:45,039 --> 00:21:49,850
sports teams do it and the most

524
00:21:47,690 --> 00:21:51,970
successful sports teams do it most

525
00:21:49,850 --> 00:21:54,830
effectively that's what we need to do

526
00:21:51,970 --> 00:21:57,710
second lesson eliminate the big play

527
00:21:54,830 --> 00:21:59,539
again I don't know maybe I'll try over

528
00:21:57,710 --> 00:22:01,759
in a workshop on this next year I would

529
00:21:59,539 --> 00:22:04,039
love to explain to you the single hike

530
00:22:01,759 --> 00:22:06,710
over three that the Seahawks used and

531
00:22:04,039 --> 00:22:09,169
the four deeper zone underneath and so

532
00:22:06,710 --> 00:22:10,700
on and that philosophy but I think it's

533
00:22:09,169 --> 00:22:12,230
a bit late there's food and during

534
00:22:10,700 --> 00:22:14,210
waiting downstairs we don't have time so

535
00:22:12,230 --> 00:22:16,009
all you need to know is that's the

536
00:22:14,210 --> 00:22:17,869
offense San Francisco 49ers with the

537
00:22:16,009 --> 00:22:20,600
ball this is the Legion of boom Seattle

538
00:22:17,869 --> 00:22:23,269
Seahawks defense traditionally defense

539
00:22:20,600 --> 00:22:25,340
is focused on defensive personnel the

540
00:22:23,269 --> 00:22:27,320
biggest players closest to your

541
00:22:25,340 --> 00:22:28,668
opponents it makes sense they're the

542
00:22:27,320 --> 00:22:29,570
ones that going to hit them every play

543
00:22:28,669 --> 00:22:30,850
they're the ones they're going to hit

544
00:22:29,570 --> 00:22:32,928
them first

545
00:22:30,850 --> 00:22:34,699
well the Seahawks did as well as the

546
00:22:32,929 --> 00:22:36,889
linebackers was really focused on the

547
00:22:34,700 --> 00:22:38,749
defensive backs that's your last line of

548
00:22:36,889 --> 00:22:41,209
defense especially the position that

549
00:22:38,749 --> 00:22:44,450
Pete Carroll played in college the free

550
00:22:41,210 --> 00:22:47,029
safety now this I mean the colors match

551
00:22:44,450 --> 00:22:48,429
it more by accident than design reminds

552
00:22:47,029 --> 00:22:51,139
me of the NIST cybersecurity framework

553
00:22:48,429 --> 00:22:56,389
you're identify protect detect respond

554
00:22:51,139 --> 00:22:58,668
recover now to be blunt I'm so old I

555
00:22:56,389 --> 00:23:00,649
worked in security operations before it

556
00:22:58,669 --> 00:23:03,499
was called security operations when it

557
00:23:00,649 --> 00:23:05,389
was this identify protect dead they've

558
00:23:03,499 --> 00:23:08,029
got in everything's over

559
00:23:05,389 --> 00:23:09,830
slowly but surely we've realized no this

560
00:23:08,029 --> 00:23:12,859
is all as important if not more

561
00:23:09,830 --> 00:23:14,720
important it's the whole thing you

562
00:23:12,859 --> 00:23:16,668
protect so then you've got less to

563
00:23:14,720 --> 00:23:18,290
detect but also you detect because your

564
00:23:16,669 --> 00:23:21,610
protection is not 100%

565
00:23:18,290 --> 00:23:25,250
and we finally learn to stop doing that

566
00:23:21,610 --> 00:23:29,540
which then look at um American football

567
00:23:25,250 --> 00:23:31,790
again you have a drive you have a set of

568
00:23:29,540 --> 00:23:34,129
place to gain yards to try and get in a

569
00:23:31,790 --> 00:23:37,220
position to score a field goal or a

570
00:23:34,130 --> 00:23:39,140
touchdown to score points you lose the

571
00:23:37,220 --> 00:23:40,760
game if your opponents score more points

572
00:23:39,140 --> 00:23:43,490
you don't lose the game if your

573
00:23:40,760 --> 00:23:46,490
opponents get more yards the yards kind

574
00:23:43,490 --> 00:23:48,710
of don't matter so you eliminate the big

575
00:23:46,490 --> 00:23:52,100
play you stop your opponent's scoring

576
00:23:48,710 --> 00:23:54,020
it's not all about who gains yards in

577
00:23:52,100 --> 00:23:55,909
the same way looking at a presentation

578
00:23:54,020 --> 00:23:58,040
from Adrian's sanabria earlier this year

579
00:23:55,910 --> 00:24:00,590
I think now I say yeah I would say 2018

580
00:23:58,040 --> 00:24:02,389
the way we used to think was that's it

581
00:24:00,590 --> 00:24:05,840
you've been owned and somehow magically

582
00:24:02,390 --> 00:24:07,660
all exploits take one millisecond from

583
00:24:05,840 --> 00:24:09,919
initial compromise to data exfiltration

584
00:24:07,660 --> 00:24:11,660
when actually it's this and whichever

585
00:24:09,920 --> 00:24:13,940
version of the cyber kill chain you want

586
00:24:11,660 --> 00:24:15,830
to use whichever you prefer which every

587
00:24:13,940 --> 00:24:18,080
suitable there's all these steps your

588
00:24:15,830 --> 00:24:19,909
attacker needs to go through there's all

589
00:24:18,080 --> 00:24:23,470
these opportunities to stop your

590
00:24:19,910 --> 00:24:27,430
attacker and all those steps which is

591
00:24:23,470 --> 00:24:30,650
illustrated by a useful concept from

592
00:24:27,430 --> 00:24:33,320
Sunil you I always say Conference 2016

593
00:24:30,650 --> 00:24:35,630
the cyber defense matrix where basically

594
00:24:33,320 --> 00:24:37,360
he's taken those five functions from the

595
00:24:35,630 --> 00:24:40,460
NIST cybersecurity framework and

596
00:24:37,360 --> 00:24:43,159
cross-reference them with assets and the

597
00:24:40,460 --> 00:24:45,620
important bit here is left and right of

598
00:24:43,160 --> 00:24:47,390
boom left is in green is pre-event

599
00:24:45,620 --> 00:24:50,080
structural awareness before you get

600
00:24:47,390 --> 00:24:54,380
exploited but as important post events

601
00:24:50,080 --> 00:24:55,909
situational awareness when you know

602
00:24:54,380 --> 00:24:57,770
you've been compromised but you've only

603
00:24:55,910 --> 00:24:59,600
been in it's only the initial compromise

604
00:24:57,770 --> 00:25:01,460
the kill change still has to be stepped

605
00:24:59,600 --> 00:25:04,730
through you can do something about it

606
00:25:01,460 --> 00:25:05,870
now what's an ill you does is really

607
00:25:04,730 --> 00:25:09,140
interesting I'm whizzing through it

608
00:25:05,870 --> 00:25:10,729
quickly taking all the asset classes all

609
00:25:09,140 --> 00:25:12,500
the different types of assets taking all

610
00:25:10,730 --> 00:25:14,090
the functions basically what they do

611
00:25:12,500 --> 00:25:16,160
within that social security framework

612
00:25:14,090 --> 00:25:17,720
and then looked at the enterprise

613
00:25:16,160 --> 00:25:19,220
security market segments and map them

614
00:25:17,720 --> 00:25:22,730
between the two and you can see where

615
00:25:19,220 --> 00:25:24,650
there are and they're armed market

616
00:25:22,730 --> 00:25:26,150
segments so what he did and this is a

617
00:25:24,650 --> 00:25:28,610
couple of years old so it's slightly oh

618
00:25:26,150 --> 00:25:30,200
if they he's taken all the security

619
00:25:28,610 --> 00:25:32,090
products and figured out what assets

620
00:25:30,200 --> 00:25:35,179
they protect he's figured out what fun

621
00:25:32,090 --> 00:25:37,520
they do and cross-reference the two so

622
00:25:35,179 --> 00:25:39,350
you can basically see where products

623
00:25:37,520 --> 00:25:40,789
work where they don't where vendors are

624
00:25:39,350 --> 00:25:43,820
selling where they're not what's

625
00:25:40,789 --> 00:25:46,400
interesting especially out here dev SEC

626
00:25:43,820 --> 00:25:48,408
con is that big white gap there

627
00:25:46,400 --> 00:25:49,580
now unfortunately missed a couple of

628
00:25:48,409 --> 00:25:51,710
thoughts cuz I made a point of talking

629
00:25:49,580 --> 00:25:53,418
to the vendors because actually there's

630
00:25:51,710 --> 00:25:55,750
a couple fit in there but there will be

631
00:25:53,419 --> 00:25:58,610
a couple I think contrast I insisting

632
00:25:55,750 --> 00:26:00,850
for example arguably fit in that gap but

633
00:25:58,610 --> 00:26:03,649
still compared to the protect column and

634
00:26:00,850 --> 00:26:05,840
if you've not a protect column and users

635
00:26:03,650 --> 00:26:09,049
cross-reference with detect there's an

636
00:26:05,840 --> 00:26:11,059
opportunity there for us to do something

637
00:26:09,049 --> 00:26:13,549
there's an opportunity there for either

638
00:26:11,059 --> 00:26:16,750
products or automation or bespoke

639
00:26:13,549 --> 00:26:19,370
scripting or whatever because as I say

640
00:26:16,750 --> 00:26:22,580
your adversary has to step through that

641
00:26:19,370 --> 00:26:24,168
entire kill chain and detect respond

642
00:26:22,580 --> 00:26:26,840
recover we've realized these are as

643
00:26:24,169 --> 00:26:28,640
important because I spin saying

644
00:26:26,840 --> 00:26:30,918
cybersecurity we don't work in

645
00:26:28,640 --> 00:26:33,140
cybersecurity anymore none of you do as

646
00:26:30,919 --> 00:26:34,909
per this slide I've stolen from Symantec

647
00:26:33,140 --> 00:26:36,770
presentation because I don't pay for a

648
00:26:34,909 --> 00:26:38,809
Internet Security Foundation

649
00:26:36,770 --> 00:26:41,149
subscription we all work in cyber

650
00:26:38,809 --> 00:26:44,120
resilience now it's all about getting

651
00:26:41,149 --> 00:26:46,668
your systems back up to at least as good

652
00:26:44,120 --> 00:26:48,408
as the state they were it's not just

653
00:26:46,669 --> 00:26:50,059
defend defend defend and hope they don't

654
00:26:48,409 --> 00:27:03,020
breach because then we completely fall

655
00:26:50,059 --> 00:27:04,570
over are you going to let them in is it

656
00:27:03,020 --> 00:27:09,320
is it not a real alarm

657
00:27:04,570 --> 00:27:12,678
so I just keep going and trying out to

658
00:27:09,320 --> 00:27:16,299
speak really loudly okay now go for it

659
00:27:12,679 --> 00:27:16,299
if you

660
00:27:18,799 --> 00:27:24,960
how long does this last fall does it

661
00:27:22,230 --> 00:27:34,700
stop it does stop all right now then

662
00:27:24,960 --> 00:27:39,620
I'll keep going he says I like that I

663
00:27:34,700 --> 00:27:39,620
like that was of course Oh

664
00:27:40,080 --> 00:27:45,510
I'll be talking to main reception later

665
00:27:42,360 --> 00:27:48,178
about that one all right now anyway yes

666
00:27:45,510 --> 00:27:49,559
so we work you slow resilience really

667
00:27:48,179 --> 00:27:51,179
good blog post on this which is now

668
00:27:49,559 --> 00:27:52,440
ingrained in all your I like that way of

669
00:27:51,179 --> 00:27:54,270
waking up the audience in grading all

670
00:27:52,440 --> 00:27:56,130
your memories nothing to sneeze that

671
00:27:54,270 --> 00:27:57,690
from NCSC you've been publishing some

672
00:27:56,130 --> 00:27:59,520
really great stuff recently she

673
00:27:57,690 --> 00:28:01,620
understands want to understand the

674
00:27:59,520 --> 00:28:04,350
concept of cyber resilience really good

675
00:28:01,620 --> 00:28:05,879
and also analogies with health and I'm

676
00:28:04,350 --> 00:28:09,780
into using analogies to explain their

677
00:28:05,880 --> 00:28:11,669
concepts also we were in so resistance

678
00:28:09,780 --> 00:28:13,200
we're now inside resilience really good

679
00:28:11,669 --> 00:28:14,730
blog post not the name of the company

680
00:28:13,200 --> 00:28:17,970
just the name of the blog Black Swan

681
00:28:14,730 --> 00:28:20,700
security win by Phil Huggins especially

682
00:28:17,970 --> 00:28:22,799
these three parts interest me because

683
00:28:20,700 --> 00:28:24,150
you go from good Cyrus decisions as part

684
00:28:22,799 --> 00:28:26,908
of resistance part of both this

685
00:28:24,150 --> 00:28:29,309
situational awareness but for resilience

686
00:28:26,909 --> 00:28:31,260
for recovery it's all about the speed of

687
00:28:29,309 --> 00:28:32,940
decision-making which again let's look

688
00:28:31,260 --> 00:28:34,260
at some military analyses from war

689
00:28:32,940 --> 00:28:36,690
studies another long piece of string

690
00:28:34,260 --> 00:28:40,620
across the investigation wall of course

691
00:28:36,690 --> 00:28:43,500
brings us to John Boyd US Air Force

692
00:28:40,620 --> 00:28:45,989
pilot in 1960s 1917 nineteen fifties

693
00:28:43,500 --> 00:28:47,940
Korea and Vietnam came up with the

694
00:28:45,990 --> 00:28:50,580
concept of doodle-loop observe orient

695
00:28:47,940 --> 00:28:53,610
decide act you start at the top you

696
00:28:50,580 --> 00:28:54,750
start at the green arrow you go around

697
00:28:53,610 --> 00:28:56,428
that loop figure out your situation

698
00:28:54,750 --> 00:28:58,740
figure out where you are where your

699
00:28:56,429 --> 00:29:00,960
adversary is you then decide what to do

700
00:28:58,740 --> 00:29:03,090
with you then act and you the whole

701
00:29:00,960 --> 00:29:04,950
point is to go fast and your opponents

702
00:29:03,090 --> 00:29:06,600
that's especially difficult in air

703
00:29:04,950 --> 00:29:09,840
situation because the attacker goes

704
00:29:06,600 --> 00:29:12,539
first so they're either loop starts by

705
00:29:09,840 --> 00:29:15,120
the time we start errors so you've got

706
00:29:12,539 --> 00:29:16,379
to be faster than them there's to me

707
00:29:15,120 --> 00:29:18,449
there's two ways of doing that because

708
00:29:16,380 --> 00:29:21,780
the way to win this kind of modern

709
00:29:18,450 --> 00:29:25,320
complex conflict is to out think them

710
00:29:21,780 --> 00:29:26,879
faster than your adversary one way I

711
00:29:25,320 --> 00:29:29,789
mean as discussed yesterday is

712
00:29:26,880 --> 00:29:32,369
automation is just go through your

713
00:29:29,789 --> 00:29:35,609
or doodle oops so fast you're vulnerable

714
00:29:32,369 --> 00:29:37,259
and not vulnerable before your opponent

715
00:29:35,609 --> 00:29:39,478
has even seen that a vulnerability is

716
00:29:37,259 --> 00:29:41,009
possible second way brings me to the

717
00:29:39,479 --> 00:29:44,429
last lesson to learn from the Seattle

718
00:29:41,009 --> 00:29:46,889
Seahawks which reminds me of this from I

719
00:29:44,429 --> 00:29:49,159
have a very connected brain reminds me

720
00:29:46,889 --> 00:29:52,080
of this quote from that Rand paper again

721
00:29:49,159 --> 00:29:54,799
the evidence of history is that soft

722
00:29:52,080 --> 00:29:57,769
factors command control processes

723
00:29:54,799 --> 00:30:00,960
tactics and strategy are first-order

724
00:29:57,769 --> 00:30:04,679
determinants of both deterrence and war

725
00:30:00,960 --> 00:30:07,320
outcomes basically who wins is your

726
00:30:04,679 --> 00:30:10,799
processes your tactics and your strategy

727
00:30:07,320 --> 00:30:13,769
compared to your adversary's processes

728
00:30:10,799 --> 00:30:16,859
tactics and strategy and their ability

729
00:30:13,769 --> 00:30:19,440
to execute on them which brings me back

730
00:30:16,859 --> 00:30:24,349
to the three main members of the Legion

731
00:30:19,440 --> 00:30:26,820
of boom Sherman Thomas Chancellor so

732
00:30:24,349 --> 00:30:28,049
Seahawks tackling video from 2015 a

733
00:30:26,820 --> 00:30:31,139
technique they've got called the

734
00:30:28,049 --> 00:30:32,340
shoulder punch it's literally that you

735
00:30:31,139 --> 00:30:34,529
knock someone over with your shoulder

736
00:30:32,340 --> 00:30:36,209
you see Sherman coming in here you can

737
00:30:34,529 --> 00:30:39,690
push the opposing quarterback out of

738
00:30:36,210 --> 00:30:42,960
bounds but it's medically defined as a

739
00:30:39,690 --> 00:30:44,549
collision sport make the point have an

740
00:30:42,960 --> 00:30:46,950
impact on your adversary Earl Thomas

741
00:30:44,549 --> 00:30:50,580
coming in from the right Earl Thomas is

742
00:30:46,950 --> 00:30:53,879
five foot ten 200 pounds but all that

743
00:30:50,580 --> 00:30:56,489
resource applied correctly Rob

744
00:30:53,879 --> 00:30:59,820
Gronkowski who takes longer to get up is

745
00:30:56,489 --> 00:31:02,249
about six foot seven 270 pounds but

746
00:30:59,820 --> 00:31:04,139
really for the shoulder punch I need to

747
00:31:02,249 --> 00:31:08,290
introduce you to number 31

748
00:31:04,139 --> 00:31:10,870
Tom bambam Chancellor

749
00:31:08,290 --> 00:31:13,240
yeah I should get a tattooed on my

750
00:31:10,870 --> 00:31:15,010
shoulders I call them my stamps I'm

751
00:31:13,240 --> 00:31:21,640
gonna hit you is istanbul friendly this

752
00:31:15,010 --> 00:31:24,879
is why a breach is not an incident it's

753
00:31:21,640 --> 00:31:29,200
not a fire it's not flood start natural

754
00:31:24,880 --> 00:31:36,340
disaster like an earthquake a breach is

755
00:31:29,200 --> 00:31:52,600
an attack an attack find adversary' with

756
00:31:36,340 --> 00:31:54,760
their own known was well known with

757
00:31:52,600 --> 00:31:58,330
infamous for what was described as

758
00:31:54,760 --> 00:32:01,240
setting the tone of the game it's a

759
00:31:58,330 --> 00:32:05,230
collision sport like it or not it's a

760
00:32:01,240 --> 00:32:07,780
violent sport you hit your opponent

761
00:32:05,230 --> 00:32:10,900
legally as hard as you can it's a

762
00:32:07,780 --> 00:32:13,420
shoulder punch you set the tone for the

763
00:32:10,900 --> 00:32:22,840
game you want to try and gain yards

764
00:32:13,420 --> 00:32:25,450
against us as his colleague Richard

765
00:32:22,840 --> 00:32:28,990
Sherman said he damages people's souls

766
00:32:25,450 --> 00:32:32,050
and that's what I think we've lost on

767
00:32:28,990 --> 00:32:35,050
defense this brings me to David Bianco's

768
00:32:32,050 --> 00:32:36,790
pyramid of pain from you adversary's you

769
00:32:35,050 --> 00:32:39,550
take away their IP addresses whatever

770
00:32:36,790 --> 00:32:42,250
they'll attack you from some more you'd

771
00:32:39,550 --> 00:32:45,639
spread their IP addresses or IOC against

772
00:32:42,250 --> 00:32:48,010
everyone else fine they'll just come at

773
00:32:45,640 --> 00:32:49,270
you from different IP addresses use

774
00:32:48,010 --> 00:32:51,910
something like the mitre attack

775
00:32:49,270 --> 00:32:55,150
framework to understand it and explain

776
00:32:51,910 --> 00:32:56,830
their TTP's you figure out their TTP's

777
00:32:55,150 --> 00:32:59,380
you share that with everyone

778
00:32:56,830 --> 00:33:01,629
they now can't use that against all

779
00:32:59,380 --> 00:33:04,090
their targets they have to rebuild the

780
00:33:01,630 --> 00:33:07,030
way they think the way they act and

781
00:33:04,090 --> 00:33:09,399
their entire tool chain from scratch now

782
00:33:07,030 --> 00:33:11,410
the reason I think this is this people

783
00:33:09,400 --> 00:33:13,860
into in cybersecurity you fit into one

784
00:33:11,410 --> 00:33:16,900
of four Bartles taxonomy of player types

785
00:33:13,860 --> 00:33:19,419
the way people enjoy playing video games

786
00:33:16,900 --> 00:33:21,220
now the socializers they explores the

787
00:33:19,420 --> 00:33:24,909
achievers we're not worried about its

788
00:33:21,220 --> 00:33:28,030
to me it's the killers in video game

789
00:33:24,909 --> 00:33:30,700
terminology to be blunt the assholes the

790
00:33:28,030 --> 00:33:32,230
trolls the griefers they like beating

791
00:33:30,700 --> 00:33:35,049
people they like beat in the game

792
00:33:32,230 --> 00:33:37,330
they're like messing up the game anyone

793
00:33:35,049 --> 00:33:40,150
with that mentality entering

794
00:33:37,330 --> 00:33:41,889
cybersecurity immediately goes red team

795
00:33:40,150 --> 00:33:43,840
eventually immediately becomes a pen

796
00:33:41,890 --> 00:33:45,669
tester likes breaking stuff likes

797
00:33:43,840 --> 00:33:48,699
breaking people likes making developers

798
00:33:45,669 --> 00:33:50,470
look bad they all go red team we don't

799
00:33:48,700 --> 00:33:52,960
have that on blue team I mean

800
00:33:50,470 --> 00:33:54,220
neroon beer has been saying in keynotes

801
00:33:52,960 --> 00:33:56,710
like the last three or four years this

802
00:33:54,220 --> 00:33:58,390
is just one good example but really you

803
00:33:56,710 --> 00:34:00,909
watch any of them we need more hackers

804
00:33:58,390 --> 00:34:04,140
on defense and I think not only that

805
00:34:00,909 --> 00:34:07,510
hacker mentality but that hacker

806
00:34:04,140 --> 00:34:09,730
attitude that to be blunt that desire to

807
00:34:07,510 --> 00:34:14,260
hurt things that desire to make your

808
00:34:09,730 --> 00:34:18,460
adversary look bad I mean as per Yan's

809
00:34:14,260 --> 00:34:20,710
talk yesterday on defense we to be blunt

810
00:34:18,460 --> 00:34:22,418
whinge all the time about users of the

811
00:34:20,710 --> 00:34:24,699
weakest link yeah we look at our

812
00:34:22,418 --> 00:34:26,500
adversaries we don't think about the

813
00:34:24,699 --> 00:34:29,290
humans on their side it's all about

814
00:34:26,500 --> 00:34:31,510
technical competition yet this humans on

815
00:34:29,290 --> 00:34:34,300
that side and this as one of this

816
00:34:31,510 --> 00:34:36,570
watching the besides Glasgow 2018

817
00:34:34,300 --> 00:34:39,369
keynote earlier this year by Paul median

818
00:34:36,570 --> 00:34:41,889
where he reminded me like Clifford Stoll

819
00:34:39,369 --> 00:34:46,030
the Cuckoo's egg the first documented

820
00:34:41,889 --> 00:34:48,490
instant response exercise I think they

821
00:34:46,030 --> 00:34:50,530
stole tapping keys on a modem line to

822
00:34:48,489 --> 00:34:52,178
slow the attacker down but not to

823
00:34:50,530 --> 00:34:53,409
disconnect them so they could slow them

824
00:34:52,179 --> 00:34:54,190
down learn what they do learn where

825
00:34:53,409 --> 00:34:57,129
they're coming from

826
00:34:54,190 --> 00:35:00,010
it started instant response started with

827
00:34:57,129 --> 00:35:01,270
deception now you have a cake deception

828
00:35:00,010 --> 00:35:03,820
now people want to burn you at the stake

829
00:35:01,270 --> 00:35:05,650
it's like no as security biosecurity we

830
00:35:03,820 --> 00:35:07,150
just don't do that but I think there's

831
00:35:05,650 --> 00:35:09,460
loads of possibilities here

832
00:35:07,150 --> 00:35:12,910
so more Charles keynote from blackout

833
00:35:09,460 --> 00:35:16,300
Asia 2017 seven axioms of security axiom

834
00:35:12,910 --> 00:35:18,940
six best defense be creative give them

835
00:35:16,300 --> 00:35:21,820
something not expecting really could

836
00:35:18,940 --> 00:35:25,330
talk yesterday by pecker it was Petco

837
00:35:21,820 --> 00:35:27,310
yes darknets honey tokens give them

838
00:35:25,330 --> 00:35:29,490
something not expecting tripwires the

839
00:35:27,310 --> 00:35:32,200
equivalent of a military minefield

840
00:35:29,490 --> 00:35:34,779
that's what we need that more malicious

841
00:35:32,200 --> 00:35:37,750
point of view also Matt talk yeah

842
00:35:34,780 --> 00:35:39,280
today just on applications that fight

843
00:35:37,750 --> 00:35:41,710
back and you wanna speed up you de loop

844
00:35:39,280 --> 00:35:43,750
if your application not only decides

845
00:35:41,710 --> 00:35:46,240
you'll be an attack but responds and

846
00:35:43,750 --> 00:35:48,100
it's the same application how fast is

847
00:35:46,240 --> 00:35:50,560
that you're completely outpacing your

848
00:35:48,100 --> 00:35:52,720
adversary and of course with deception

849
00:35:50,560 --> 00:35:55,390
they don't know that they've been

850
00:35:52,720 --> 00:35:58,270
outpaced or not really good talk from

851
00:35:55,390 --> 00:35:58,900
beast Iceland and earlier this year Alex

852
00:35:58,270 --> 00:36:01,600
Davis

853
00:35:58,900 --> 00:36:03,580
I'm just working together this again I

854
00:36:01,600 --> 00:36:07,450
mean there's loads more to say it's a

855
00:36:03,580 --> 00:36:10,360
team game I mean sir alex says just work

856
00:36:07,450 --> 00:36:11,830
with others share information then

857
00:36:10,360 --> 00:36:13,480
everybody's working together you've got

858
00:36:11,830 --> 00:36:15,850
all that knowledge and also once your

859
00:36:13,480 --> 00:36:17,980
opponents make a mistake everybody knows

860
00:36:15,850 --> 00:36:19,990
about it I mean this I'm quoting from

861
00:36:17,980 --> 00:36:21,400
this talk from besides Munich earlier

862
00:36:19,990 --> 00:36:24,129
this year but Richard Beit lick has been

863
00:36:21,400 --> 00:36:25,630
saying this since 2009 the way it has

864
00:36:24,130 --> 00:36:27,610
been this defenders dilemma once they've

865
00:36:25,630 --> 00:36:29,590
got in with dead we're done when

866
00:36:27,610 --> 00:36:31,690
actually it should be the intruders

867
00:36:29,590 --> 00:36:33,940
dilemma once they get detected once

868
00:36:31,690 --> 00:36:38,260
everything gets burned they have to

869
00:36:33,940 --> 00:36:40,420
start again loads of ideas gas lighting

870
00:36:38,260 --> 00:36:43,420
with honey pots and mirages from Kate

871
00:36:40,420 --> 00:36:46,360
Pierce from Cisco there's only slides

872
00:36:43,420 --> 00:36:47,800
for this but it's really I hope she gets

873
00:36:46,360 --> 00:36:49,990
a chance to present it somewhere there

874
00:36:47,800 --> 00:36:51,850
where we can see it it's genuinely

875
00:36:49,990 --> 00:36:53,979
seriously Machiavellian I mean this is

876
00:36:51,850 --> 00:36:56,410
just I just want to give you an idea of

877
00:36:53,980 --> 00:36:59,020
how many ideas there are we're not using

878
00:36:56,410 --> 00:37:02,620
all the work that's got into this and

879
00:36:59,020 --> 00:37:04,960
just all the possibilities there because

880
00:37:02,620 --> 00:37:06,940
we forget this OODA loop is the way to

881
00:37:04,960 --> 00:37:10,450
win be faster than your opponent but

882
00:37:06,940 --> 00:37:13,180
it's relative speed you just have to be

883
00:37:10,450 --> 00:37:17,350
faster than them so if you can slow them

884
00:37:13,180 --> 00:37:19,240
down hit your opponent I mean you're all

885
00:37:17,350 --> 00:37:20,920
in dev SEC ops for a reason you're all

886
00:37:19,240 --> 00:37:22,569
in dev ops for a reason you know how

887
00:37:20,920 --> 00:37:24,130
painful it used to be in like waterfall

888
00:37:22,570 --> 00:37:26,170
you know the most painful thing you go

889
00:37:24,130 --> 00:37:28,810
through it's changed control when

890
00:37:26,170 --> 00:37:33,070
everything slows down force your

891
00:37:28,810 --> 00:37:36,250
addresses to to implement ITIL right if

892
00:37:33,070 --> 00:37:40,630
you make one mistake if you make one

893
00:37:36,250 --> 00:37:43,980
mistake with your code your entire

894
00:37:40,630 --> 00:37:47,770
attack in ten organizations just goes

895
00:37:43,980 --> 00:37:48,670
make it that bad when adversaries make

896
00:37:47,770 --> 00:37:51,400
you master

897
00:37:48,670 --> 00:37:53,020
ah so many more ideas red pilot red pill

898
00:37:51,400 --> 00:37:56,050
if resilient skater Kelly Shortridge

899
00:37:53,020 --> 00:37:58,630
countermeasure 2017 chaos monkey part of

900
00:37:56,050 --> 00:38:01,930
the simian army from Netflix if you've

901
00:37:58,630 --> 00:38:05,200
got a really resilient network let out

902
00:38:01,930 --> 00:38:07,980
the chaos monkeys your opponent's see -

903
00:38:05,200 --> 00:38:12,129
and I see Nick there the sea - writer

904
00:38:07,980 --> 00:38:14,920
yeah your sea - Network has to be able

905
00:38:12,130 --> 00:38:17,140
to has to be as resilient as the network

906
00:38:14,920 --> 00:38:19,720
you're attacking otherwise just the

907
00:38:17,140 --> 00:38:22,720
terrain is such a mess how does that see

908
00:38:19,720 --> 00:38:24,399
- keep going and if I mean luckily all

909
00:38:22,720 --> 00:38:26,919
these references will be up if you watch

910
00:38:24,400 --> 00:38:30,310
just one presentation that I've referred

911
00:38:26,920 --> 00:38:32,410
to so Neil knew I always say 2017

912
00:38:30,310 --> 00:38:33,090
solving cyber security in the next five

913
00:38:32,410 --> 00:38:35,259
years

914
00:38:33,090 --> 00:38:37,150
basically you'll be pleased to hear from

915
00:38:35,260 --> 00:38:39,340
someone I'm really impressed with and

916
00:38:37,150 --> 00:38:40,870
really think you should watch you see

917
00:38:39,340 --> 00:38:43,330
there at the bottom right deficit cops

918
00:38:40,870 --> 00:38:46,210
is the answer because you've got control

919
00:38:43,330 --> 00:38:48,640
of the terrain your systems can be

920
00:38:46,210 --> 00:38:49,330
completely compromised and you just turn

921
00:38:48,640 --> 00:38:50,980
them off and on again

922
00:38:49,330 --> 00:38:53,980
and they all come back up virtually or

923
00:38:50,980 --> 00:38:56,380
with all those deception ideas as we say

924
00:38:53,980 --> 00:38:58,330
attack aware applications you divert the

925
00:38:56,380 --> 00:39:00,100
attacker to somewhere that doesn't

926
00:38:58,330 --> 00:39:02,200
matter or somewhere where they keep

927
00:39:00,100 --> 00:39:04,089
attacking so you learn their TTP's you

928
00:39:02,200 --> 00:39:05,560
learn the mitre attack framework to

929
00:39:04,090 --> 00:39:08,650
exchange their tepees to everything else

930
00:39:05,560 --> 00:39:10,200
it's in sports terms it's such a

931
00:39:08,650 --> 00:39:13,780
home-field advantage

932
00:39:10,200 --> 00:39:16,810
but as with this I can't sell you like

933
00:39:13,780 --> 00:39:18,700
the OODA loop 9000 to make this work as

934
00:39:16,810 --> 00:39:21,910
per a slide I've stolen hopefully it's

935
00:39:18,700 --> 00:39:23,950
okay from Frasor it's not a blinkie box

936
00:39:21,910 --> 00:39:25,330
you can buy install and ignore this is

937
00:39:23,950 --> 00:39:26,379
something you have to do and it's

938
00:39:25,330 --> 00:39:29,110
something you have to keep doing but

939
00:39:26,380 --> 00:39:32,290
it's a strategy it's a concept it's not

940
00:39:29,110 --> 00:39:34,570
a technical tactical solution it's a

941
00:39:32,290 --> 00:39:35,920
it's a way of thinking I was should say

942
00:39:34,570 --> 00:39:38,110
a new way of thinking about the stuff

943
00:39:35,920 --> 00:39:42,280
I've heard this weekend from various

944
00:39:38,110 --> 00:39:44,740
speakers but you've done this before

945
00:39:42,280 --> 00:39:47,800
you've adopted different concepts you've

946
00:39:44,740 --> 00:39:49,629
adopted different cultures this is

947
00:39:47,800 --> 00:39:52,030
something else I think we can all do and

948
00:39:49,630 --> 00:39:54,550
I would argue something we have to do

949
00:39:52,030 --> 00:39:57,670
because we're all really smart real

950
00:39:54,550 --> 00:39:59,080
working really hard and yet I've given a

951
00:39:57,670 --> 00:40:00,640
cybersecurity presentation I've

952
00:39:59,080 --> 00:40:01,380
mentioned warfare so I really should

953
00:40:00,640 --> 00:40:05,700
include a

954
00:40:01,380 --> 00:40:07,860
quote the way it feels is this quote

955
00:40:05,700 --> 00:40:10,470
strategy without tactics is the slowest

956
00:40:07,860 --> 00:40:12,870
route to victory but tactics without

957
00:40:10,470 --> 00:40:14,879
strategy which it feels like we have in

958
00:40:12,870 --> 00:40:16,770
this industry right now in places enough

959
00:40:14,880 --> 00:40:19,830
I've heard a lot of good stuff this

960
00:40:16,770 --> 00:40:23,940
weekend it's the noise before defeat and

961
00:40:19,830 --> 00:40:26,160
that noise before the free phrase really

962
00:40:23,940 --> 00:40:28,010
sticks with me so the lessons use others

963
00:40:26,160 --> 00:40:30,569
just from all sorts of different areas

964
00:40:28,010 --> 00:40:32,610
practice is everything as we've

965
00:40:30,570 --> 00:40:34,860
discussed threat modeling eliminate the

966
00:40:32,610 --> 00:40:36,990
big play it's okay to be breached as

967
00:40:34,860 --> 00:40:39,120
long as you're not fully compromised

968
00:40:36,990 --> 00:40:42,390
react to that really quickly like we

969
00:40:39,120 --> 00:40:46,020
said attack aware applications out here

970
00:40:42,390 --> 00:40:47,759
your opponent just be I don't know cyber

971
00:40:46,020 --> 00:40:49,920
shoulder punch or something

972
00:40:47,760 --> 00:40:51,720
slow your opponents down make them so

973
00:40:49,920 --> 00:40:54,570
afraid they're going to mess about every

974
00:40:51,720 --> 00:40:58,620
single action that their process is slow

975
00:40:54,570 --> 00:41:00,510
right down all maybe I'm wrong some fun

976
00:40:58,620 --> 00:41:02,910
videos some nice analogies but this

977
00:41:00,510 --> 00:41:04,890
isn't go anywhere maybe they don't know

978
00:41:02,910 --> 00:41:06,450
about deficit cops or we can keep trying

979
00:41:04,890 --> 00:41:18,870
to play golf in the game of american

980
00:41:06,450 --> 00:41:20,339
football still on the first hole bob and

981
00:41:18,870 --> 00:41:22,549
this is davis teeing it up here's the

982
00:41:20,340 --> 00:41:22,550
drug

983
00:41:27,240 --> 00:41:41,439
for the green oh good great tasteless

984
00:41:36,280 --> 00:41:43,600
filling can you do this fun to watch but

985
00:41:41,440 --> 00:41:45,340
sometimes it feels like we're that we're

986
00:41:43,600 --> 00:41:46,230
that golfer with the American football

987
00:41:45,340 --> 00:41:49,270
players on the field I think

988
00:41:46,230 --> 00:41:50,380
strategically we can do a lot better but

989
00:41:49,270 --> 00:41:52,420
I've given you a glimpse to my

990
00:41:50,380 --> 00:41:54,190
investigation wall it's definitely full

991
00:41:52,420 --> 00:41:56,260
they're us I know they're incredibly

992
00:41:54,190 --> 00:41:57,880
long pieces of string across it I'm

993
00:41:56,260 --> 00:41:59,950
around for at least a couple of hours to

994
00:41:57,880 --> 00:42:01,380
discuss it I welcome your feedback as

995
00:41:59,950 --> 00:42:04,509
long as it's constructive good or bad

996
00:42:01,380 --> 00:42:07,000
I'm really interested in conceptually

997
00:42:04,510 --> 00:42:09,160
I mean as are you being at dev SEC on

998
00:42:07,000 --> 00:42:11,050
conceptually how we can make a

999
00:42:09,160 --> 00:42:13,779
difference how we can start winning the

1000
00:42:11,050 --> 00:42:14,710
game we're in so thank you very much for

1001
00:42:13,780 --> 00:42:25,839
your time

1002
00:42:14,710 --> 00:42:27,799
[Applause]

1003
00:42:25,839 --> 00:42:29,529
questions afterwards you've got stuff to

1004
00:42:27,799 --> 00:42:33,288
do

1005
00:42:29,529 --> 00:42:33,920
are there any questions oh we have a

1006
00:42:33,289 --> 00:42:37,670
question

1007
00:42:33,920 --> 00:42:41,720
well the mic trains on its way any

1008
00:42:37,670 --> 00:42:43,940
thoughts on legal legalizing commercial

1009
00:42:41,720 --> 00:42:46,879
corporation's capability to respond with

1010
00:42:43,940 --> 00:42:50,809
counter attack with counter attack with

1011
00:42:46,880 --> 00:42:52,640
counter attack all within your own

1012
00:42:50,809 --> 00:42:58,220
network yes it can't counter attacking

1013
00:42:52,640 --> 00:43:03,368
is massive there's a whole the psalm

1014
00:42:58,220 --> 00:43:05,660
1916 the German soccer team 1966 and

1015
00:43:03,369 --> 00:43:07,369
conceptually there's all sorts of

1016
00:43:05,660 --> 00:43:09,920
explanations and justifications and

1017
00:43:07,369 --> 00:43:11,299
reasons why counter-attack in your

1018
00:43:09,920 --> 00:43:12,740
opponent is that they're wheat you're

1019
00:43:11,299 --> 00:43:14,029
the attackers that they're weakest so

1020
00:43:12,740 --> 00:43:17,269
you should counter-attack them however

1021
00:43:14,029 --> 00:43:20,180
the whole defend forward idea from the

1022
00:43:17,269 --> 00:43:23,180
American do deed idea and just strike

1023
00:43:20,180 --> 00:43:25,220
back in general attribution I would

1024
00:43:23,180 --> 00:43:27,618
argue quickly attribution is not good

1025
00:43:25,220 --> 00:43:32,118
enough as if you look up my name and

1026
00:43:27,619 --> 00:43:34,400
strike back server on Google I've been

1027
00:43:32,119 --> 00:43:36,380
arguing against like proper strike back

1028
00:43:34,400 --> 00:43:40,130
for like over two decades it's just it's

1029
00:43:36,380 --> 00:43:42,049
never been a good idea so I think I

1030
00:43:40,130 --> 00:43:46,190
think you make your own network so

1031
00:43:42,049 --> 00:43:47,869
hostile and so weird and so you make

1032
00:43:46,190 --> 00:43:50,900
your attackers so unsure of what it is

1033
00:43:47,869 --> 00:43:52,670
that you don't need to strike back

1034
00:43:50,900 --> 00:43:55,220
because attackers are just so afraid of

1035
00:43:52,670 --> 00:43:57,769
wasting time or burning TTP's in your

1036
00:43:55,220 --> 00:44:00,189
network they just give up or they get so

1037
00:43:57,769 --> 00:44:03,799
slow we just end up in some kind of

1038
00:44:00,190 --> 00:44:05,480
normal fight where it's even whereas at

1039
00:44:03,799 --> 00:44:07,099
the moment it feels like we build a

1040
00:44:05,480 --> 00:44:09,279
really strong castle and then just watch

1041
00:44:07,099 --> 00:44:12,970
it slowly but surely get knocked down

1042
00:44:09,279 --> 00:44:12,970
any more questions

1043
00:44:15,300 --> 00:44:20,260
no and I'm glad we're saving the sports

1044
00:44:17,400 --> 00:44:25,349
arguments for later thank you very much

1045
00:44:20,260 --> 00:44:25,349
[Applause]
