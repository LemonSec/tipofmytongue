00:00:07,259 --> 00:00:11,840
can enjoy the rest of the talks which

4
00:00:09,269 --> 00:00:14,639
are critics

5
00:00:11,840 --> 00:00:16,980
first of all as you may have noticed

6
00:00:14,639 --> 00:00:19,350
English is not my first language so

7
00:00:16,980 --> 00:00:22,590
sorry if I say something funny because

8
00:00:19,350 --> 00:00:26,310
it's very early for my brain my name is

okay just so you know why I'm here

14
00:00:38,730 --> 00:00:43,578
besides being from BBVA next

15
00:00:40,920 --> 00:00:47,750
technologies I work for enterprise

16
00:00:43,579 --> 00:00:52,379
security at BBBS holding we work

17
00:00:47,750 --> 00:00:56,250
worldwide okay so let's begin see if

18
00:00:52,379 --> 00:00:57,449
coffee already kicking for those of you

19
00:00:56,250 --> 00:01:00,149
who don't know be BBA

20
00:00:57,449 --> 00:01:04,140
we're a Spanish bank one of the largest

21
00:01:00,149 --> 00:01:08,159
banks at Spain and we have banks around

22
00:01:04,140 --> 00:01:10,200
the world okay we have a lot of business

23
00:01:08,159 --> 00:01:13,020
around the world a lot of employees a

24
00:01:10,200 --> 00:01:16,530
lot of customers for example we have

25
00:01:13,020 --> 00:01:20,189
BBVA Compass at USA and we have bancomer

26
00:01:16,530 --> 00:01:22,680
at Mexico as I said we are one of the

27
00:01:20,189 --> 00:01:24,919
biggest bank at Spain and until a few

28
00:01:22,680 --> 00:01:28,950
years ago we were a traditional Big Bang

29
00:01:24,920 --> 00:01:30,900
but our CEO or president understood that

30
00:01:28,950 --> 00:01:34,020
this had to change because there are new

31
00:01:30,900 --> 00:01:36,360
players on on the way everything is

32
00:01:34,020 --> 00:01:38,759
changing and they basically say that we

33
00:01:36,360 --> 00:01:41,100
needed to be a digital company that we

34
00:01:38,759 --> 00:01:45,450
needed to transfer the way we do banking

35
00:01:41,100 --> 00:01:46,829
and the easiest way to to explain what

36
00:01:45,450 --> 00:01:51,450
we're doing were becoming a software

37
00:01:46,829 --> 00:01:54,179
company that does monkey ok

38
00:01:51,450 --> 00:01:57,149
that's it that's their their idea that's

39
00:01:54,180 --> 00:01:59,130
what they want to do and they've been

40
00:01:57,149 --> 00:02:03,119
we've been on a project for the last few

41
00:01:59,130 --> 00:02:06,600
years of transforming the whole bank

42
00:02:03,119 --> 00:02:10,729
even a few weeks ago they transfer they

43
00:02:06,600 --> 00:02:10,728
hope the whole organization how we are

44
00:02:10,810 --> 00:02:19,000
working inside the bank so from the tech

45
00:02:15,610 --> 00:02:22,060
areas perspective these are the elements

46
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:24,460
for this transformation that we're using

47
00:02:22,060 --> 00:02:28,180
the principles that were using one of

48
00:02:24,460 --> 00:02:30,430
the big changes was we're working with

49
00:02:28,180 --> 00:02:33,700
internal talent one of the changes that

50
00:02:30,430 --> 00:02:36,100
the bank decided was we cannot keep

51
00:02:33,700 --> 00:02:38,679
using developers from consulting firms

52
00:02:36,100 --> 00:02:40,540
from for each project because we we lose

53
00:02:38,680 --> 00:02:44,320
the know-how we didn't need to

54
00:02:40,540 --> 00:02:46,030
internalise up the talent in this case

55
00:02:44,320 --> 00:02:49,600
or developers or architects all of that

56
00:02:46,030 --> 00:02:51,760
and that's why we have 12,000 developers

57
00:02:49,600 --> 00:02:54,870
right now working inside the bank that's

58
00:02:51,760 --> 00:02:57,579
why the title of the presentation

59
00:02:54,870 --> 00:02:59,020
another thing was we need to automate as

60
00:02:57,580 --> 00:03:00,760
much as possible from a technical

61
00:02:59,020 --> 00:03:03,460
perspective every process we can

62
00:03:00,760 --> 00:03:06,640
automate we're going to automate we need

63
00:03:03,460 --> 00:03:10,090
to shift our mindset to DevOps and work

64
00:03:06,640 --> 00:03:12,149
end-to-end customer centric teams right

65
00:03:10,090 --> 00:03:13,780
now don't work on a project and they

66
00:03:12,150 --> 00:03:16,060
move to the next one

67
00:03:13,780 --> 00:03:18,670
they work for in products or that's what

68
00:03:16,060 --> 00:03:21,520
we're trying to achieve and they get to

69
00:03:18,670 --> 00:03:23,619
operate and keep working on those

70
00:03:21,520 --> 00:03:26,560
products and those initiatives that's

71
00:03:23,620 --> 00:03:28,780
part of the idea another thing another

72
00:03:26,560 --> 00:03:32,410
interesting thing was we were obsessed

73
00:03:28,780 --> 00:03:35,890
in the use of api's even we have open

74
00:03:32,410 --> 00:03:39,990
api's we have in USA we have open

75
00:03:35,890 --> 00:03:43,089
banking and we're actually offering to

76
00:03:39,990 --> 00:03:47,140
two other institutions to work with our

77
00:03:43,090 --> 00:03:51,280
api's because we notice we were

78
00:03:47,140 --> 00:03:52,540
repeating a lot of code it was for

79
00:03:51,280 --> 00:03:56,290
example there is a public presentation

80
00:03:52,540 --> 00:03:58,870
of BBVA where we have as much lines of

81
00:03:56,290 --> 00:04:00,400
code as Facebook or Google but some of

82
00:03:58,870 --> 00:04:02,410
that not because we had a lot of

83
00:04:00,400 --> 00:04:03,280
software but because we repeat a lot and

84
00:04:02,410 --> 00:04:07,090
that's a bad thing

85
00:04:03,280 --> 00:04:08,590
so we're trying to achieve that and we

86
00:04:07,090 --> 00:04:10,510
want to work with global communities who

87
00:04:08,590 --> 00:04:13,690
want to be a worldwide bank that works

88
00:04:10,510 --> 00:04:17,039
worldwide not each country doing what

89
00:04:13,690 --> 00:04:20,649
they want and doing different stuff so

90
00:04:17,040 --> 00:04:22,900
what's the text the technological stack

91
00:04:20,649 --> 00:04:24,068
for this one of the things that the bank

92
00:04:22,900 --> 00:04:27,849
decided was to

93
00:04:24,069 --> 00:04:30,280
it's own banking platform okay this is a

94
00:04:27,850 --> 00:04:35,139
platform for developers for the web

95
00:04:30,280 --> 00:04:38,770
developers to build deployed and operate

96
00:04:35,139 --> 00:04:41,169
banking services okay we have some

97
00:04:38,770 --> 00:04:42,729
principles here that we love to achieve

98
00:04:41,169 --> 00:04:46,030
with this platform the platform is

99
00:04:42,729 --> 00:04:49,568
called ether we want that platform to be

100
00:04:46,030 --> 00:04:51,340
a global cloud platform this is not that

101
00:04:49,569 --> 00:04:54,940
we only have one and we use it from all

102
00:04:51,340 --> 00:04:56,530
worldwide but that we can do that but we

103
00:04:54,940 --> 00:04:59,410
can have the same platform in every

104
00:04:56,530 --> 00:05:01,599
country the same we just deployed in

105
00:04:59,410 --> 00:05:03,460
every country with the infrastructure

106
00:05:01,599 --> 00:05:06,219
that we need and this infrastructure

107
00:05:03,460 --> 00:05:08,560
could should work on hybrid cloud it

108
00:05:06,220 --> 00:05:10,300
should be our own internal private cloud

109
00:05:08,560 --> 00:05:13,660
like OpenStack or something like that

110
00:05:10,300 --> 00:05:15,940
or it could be Amazon assure global

111
00:05:13,660 --> 00:05:18,430
cloud sorry Google Cloud or something

112
00:05:15,940 --> 00:05:20,580
like that again automation we want the

113
00:05:18,430 --> 00:05:24,430
the platform to be as automated as

114
00:05:20,580 --> 00:05:27,280
possible in each way we can this is an

115
00:05:24,430 --> 00:05:29,289
important thing we're trying to use open

116
00:05:27,280 --> 00:05:31,419
source as much as possible good open

117
00:05:29,289 --> 00:05:33,520
source solutions and we're trying to do

118
00:05:31,419 --> 00:05:34,419
bender decoupling not because we believe

119
00:05:33,520 --> 00:05:39,400
that benders

120
00:05:34,419 --> 00:05:41,169
don't work but because we get to use the

121
00:05:39,400 --> 00:05:43,090
best of each vendor and if we're gonna

122
00:05:41,169 --> 00:05:46,180
change vendors we can still do it and

123
00:05:43,090 --> 00:05:48,580
the platform is gonna keep working as I

124
00:05:46,180 --> 00:05:51,360
say this is a platform for developers so

125
00:05:48,580 --> 00:05:54,849
is it valper centric it's not a SAS

126
00:05:51,360 --> 00:05:56,530
solution for example although we we have

127
00:05:54,849 --> 00:06:00,159
some initiative around that that for

128
00:05:56,530 --> 00:06:03,280
example the the mobile application from

129
00:06:00,159 --> 00:06:06,310
BBVA is the same in all the countries

130
00:06:03,280 --> 00:06:09,849
you know he actually has won some awards

131
00:06:06,310 --> 00:06:11,380
because of that and finally it's a

132
00:06:09,849 --> 00:06:14,289
banking platform so it has to be

133
00:06:11,380 --> 00:06:18,039
reliable it should be easy to operate

134
00:06:14,289 --> 00:06:22,780
and for our developers and for operation

135
00:06:18,039 --> 00:06:26,860
teams so basically we're what what I'm

136
00:06:22,780 --> 00:06:30,880
describing is this shiny new very good

137
00:06:26,860 --> 00:06:34,870
sports car but we still have to live

138
00:06:30,880 --> 00:06:37,920
with this the old reliable sports car

139
00:06:34,870 --> 00:06:42,610
because we need to keep maintaining all

140
00:06:37,920 --> 00:06:44,110
the OL or legacy projects obviously they

141
00:06:42,610 --> 00:06:46,720
change to the new platform it's not

142
00:06:44,110 --> 00:06:49,720
gonna be from one day to another it's

143
00:06:46,720 --> 00:06:53,950
not going to be Big Bang so we have to

144
00:06:49,720 --> 00:06:56,100
work with that as well okay another

145
00:06:53,950 --> 00:06:59,440
thing I would like to point out is a

146
00:06:56,100 --> 00:07:01,710
security solutions market when we

147
00:06:59,440 --> 00:07:04,120
started all of this a few years ago

148
00:07:01,710 --> 00:07:05,469
we've been doing a lot of research these

149
00:07:04,120 --> 00:07:08,350
last few years

150
00:07:05,470 --> 00:07:10,840
on one hand we had security vendors that

151
00:07:08,350 --> 00:07:13,720
had some really good solutions for

152
00:07:10,840 --> 00:07:15,729
legacy problems for what we needed or

153
00:07:13,720 --> 00:07:17,200
what we believed we were gonna need we

154
00:07:15,730 --> 00:07:21,130
didn't find security vendors to be

155
00:07:17,200 --> 00:07:23,620
mature enough for example api's we as I

156
00:07:21,130 --> 00:07:25,810
said we are obsessed with api's and we

157
00:07:23,620 --> 00:07:27,370
believed for example that for doing

158
00:07:25,810 --> 00:07:29,980
application security in this new world

159
00:07:27,370 --> 00:07:34,900
we need good API so we can work with the

160
00:07:29,980 --> 00:07:36,820
products using those interfaces we've

161
00:07:34,900 --> 00:07:39,400
seen a lot of improvement especially

162
00:07:36,820 --> 00:07:41,590
this year but when we started that's

163
00:07:39,400 --> 00:07:44,979
what we saw on the other hand we saw

164
00:07:41,590 --> 00:07:48,099
very good startups with advanced

165
00:07:44,980 --> 00:07:49,960
technologies for niche problems that

166
00:07:48,100 --> 00:07:52,990
were years ahead of what we actually

167
00:07:49,960 --> 00:07:55,450
needed and the other thing was that this

168
00:07:52,990 --> 00:07:57,760
method basically they they were startup

169
00:07:55,450 --> 00:07:59,620
so they had this startup mindset of

170
00:07:57,760 --> 00:08:02,169
innovating and changing all the all the

171
00:07:59,620 --> 00:08:04,180
time and for us being a bank and having

172
00:08:02,169 --> 00:08:06,430
to develop a platform it was hard for us

173
00:08:04,180 --> 00:08:09,460
because the pace of innovation and

174
00:08:06,430 --> 00:08:11,680
changes and they change API they changed

175
00:08:09,460 --> 00:08:15,010
the functionality and all of that so we

176
00:08:11,680 --> 00:08:17,890
say we could work with that but it's

177
00:08:15,010 --> 00:08:20,469
important that we take that in in our

178
00:08:17,890 --> 00:08:24,219
mind honey and the others part of the

179
00:08:20,470 --> 00:08:27,220
equation was open source solutions we

180
00:08:24,220 --> 00:08:28,570
saw some nice things in open source we

181
00:08:27,220 --> 00:08:30,970
are actually part of the open source

182
00:08:28,570 --> 00:08:33,250
community as well at BBA because we

183
00:08:30,970 --> 00:08:35,979
believe in that but they were not mature

184
00:08:33,250 --> 00:08:37,690
enough for for a banking platform we

185
00:08:35,979 --> 00:08:41,320
couldn't say let's pick this open source

186
00:08:37,690 --> 00:08:44,140
solution and just use it okay so with

187
00:08:41,320 --> 00:08:46,510
all this context we set the hypothesis

188
00:08:44,140 --> 00:08:49,209
and said well how can we change the way

189
00:08:46,510 --> 00:08:51,640
we do application security inside this

190
00:08:49,209 --> 00:08:54,550
platform we have we believe that we have

191
00:08:51,640 --> 00:08:56,829
golden opportunity here and we said well

192
00:08:54,550 --> 00:08:59,140
we need to do the tech part we need to

193
00:08:56,829 --> 00:09:01,000
do something about the technology part

194
00:08:59,140 --> 00:09:02,709
and trying to come up with a

195
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:05,529
technological solution for this new

196
00:09:02,709 --> 00:09:08,500
application security but technology is

197
00:09:05,529 --> 00:09:10,779
not all and we need to do the cultural

198
00:09:08,500 --> 00:09:14,440
to tackle the cultural problem as well

199
00:09:10,779 --> 00:09:17,260
okay we said to work with those two

200
00:09:14,440 --> 00:09:20,190
ideas in mind and this is what we're

201
00:09:17,260 --> 00:09:23,339
doing after a few years okay right now

202
00:09:20,190 --> 00:09:26,620
inside VBS holding we have three teams

203
00:09:23,339 --> 00:09:29,140
working on this problem all aligned

204
00:09:26,620 --> 00:09:31,980
we're very aligned of the three teams

205
00:09:29,140 --> 00:09:34,230
each working on a different problem

206
00:09:31,980 --> 00:09:37,390
specialize on a different problem and

207
00:09:34,230 --> 00:09:40,600
we're all the teams are working on the

208
00:09:37,390 --> 00:09:42,430
cultural change or the change in the

209
00:09:40,600 --> 00:09:45,730
mindset okay

210
00:09:42,430 --> 00:09:48,550
we have a team which one the one I'm

211
00:09:45,730 --> 00:09:50,680
part of working on the new platform we

212
00:09:48,550 --> 00:09:53,890
have a lapse team that's working on

213
00:09:50,680 --> 00:09:55,709
special problems and we have a team that

214
00:09:53,890 --> 00:09:59,949
is working with the legacy platform the

215
00:09:55,709 --> 00:10:02,800
reliable old support guard so what is

216
00:09:59,949 --> 00:10:05,800
seconds the team I'm part of seconds is

217
00:10:02,800 --> 00:10:08,560
basically security so service as you may

218
00:10:05,800 --> 00:10:11,529
have guessed it's one of the main

219
00:10:08,560 --> 00:10:13,930
components of the ether platform and the

220
00:10:11,529 --> 00:10:16,570
idea for seconds is that we can provide

221
00:10:13,930 --> 00:10:23,170
security on-demand for our developers

222
00:10:16,570 --> 00:10:24,519
and also that the platform is secure by

223
00:10:23,170 --> 00:10:27,599
default it's embedded inside the

224
00:10:24,519 --> 00:10:30,660
platform for example we have some few

225
00:10:27,600 --> 00:10:35,260
products working around the

226
00:10:30,660 --> 00:10:39,610
authentication authorization stack based

227
00:10:35,260 --> 00:10:42,699
on exhale l ml sorry we have a product

228
00:10:39,610 --> 00:10:47,380
doing asset security verification we

229
00:10:42,699 --> 00:10:52,649
have which is but we have cryptography

230
00:10:47,380 --> 00:10:54,970
as a service product which is chameleon

231
00:10:52,649 --> 00:10:56,380
we have another one that's right there

232
00:10:54,970 --> 00:10:58,360
I'm going to talk about it right now

233
00:10:56,380 --> 00:11:04,360
tackling the software development

234
00:10:58,360 --> 00:11:05,560
lifecycle so for developers we say well

235
00:11:04,360 --> 00:11:08,110
as I said before we have

236
00:11:05,560 --> 00:11:10,869
the opportunity developers are going to

237
00:11:08,110 --> 00:11:11,980
change the way they do their stuff in

238
00:11:10,870 --> 00:11:13,720
the bank because they're going to have a

239
00:11:11,980 --> 00:11:16,090
new platform which is very standard

240
00:11:13,720 --> 00:11:18,250
around the whole bank the process are

241
00:11:16,090 --> 00:11:21,370
going to be very standard what are our

242
00:11:18,250 --> 00:11:23,680
ideas for this for changing the way they

243
00:11:21,370 --> 00:11:26,110
do application security the first thing

244
00:11:23,680 --> 00:11:28,270
we say we want to provide feedback as

245
00:11:26,110 --> 00:11:30,640
early as possible as you want I'm sure

246
00:11:28,270 --> 00:11:34,360
in this room all know chip shifting left

247
00:11:30,640 --> 00:11:37,180
the feedback we want this week feedback

248
00:11:34,360 --> 00:11:38,860
to be as a service using the same

249
00:11:37,180 --> 00:11:42,880
principles at the saying of a platform

250
00:11:38,860 --> 00:11:45,940
and when I say this we want them to do

251
00:11:42,880 --> 00:11:47,800
security by choice not because we tell

252
00:11:45,940 --> 00:11:49,630
them that they have to do it so we're

253
00:11:47,800 --> 00:11:52,599
trying to make it as easy as possible

254
00:11:49,630 --> 00:11:55,810
for them to do it and the last part we

255
00:11:52,600 --> 00:11:58,060
want to automate as much as possible the

256
00:11:55,810 --> 00:12:00,279
security checks or enforcement or

257
00:11:58,060 --> 00:12:02,290
basically the security process that we

258
00:12:00,279 --> 00:12:08,500
need to achieve there was a DevOps at

259
00:12:02,290 --> 00:12:11,949
speed okay as I said before we did a lot

260
00:12:08,500 --> 00:12:13,300
of research we saw a lot of tools and we

261
00:12:11,950 --> 00:12:15,960
were on a point where we had to make

262
00:12:13,300 --> 00:12:19,660
make a choice and we said we have two

263
00:12:15,960 --> 00:12:21,880
different choices one we select the best

264
00:12:19,660 --> 00:12:25,180
tool for each use case for each product

265
00:12:21,880 --> 00:12:27,880
sorry for each problem we try to deploy

266
00:12:25,180 --> 00:12:29,349
that solution worldwide we try to govern

267
00:12:27,880 --> 00:12:31,720
that that solution is being used

268
00:12:29,350 --> 00:12:33,880
correctly and if we need to do a change

269
00:12:31,720 --> 00:12:36,610
of the solution then we need to train

270
00:12:33,880 --> 00:12:39,970
their developers again or these are

271
00:12:36,610 --> 00:12:42,190
separated solutions or we can develop a

272
00:12:39,970 --> 00:12:44,920
product that has all the services that

273
00:12:42,190 --> 00:12:47,770
we need for our developers in a

274
00:12:44,920 --> 00:12:53,260
standardized way a standardized graphic

275
00:12:47,770 --> 00:12:55,060
interface and obviously we infer the

276
00:12:53,260 --> 00:12:58,360
second one because that's why I'm here

277
00:12:55,060 --> 00:13:01,479
and the nice thing for example we've

278
00:12:58,360 --> 00:13:03,880
seen this year the market go in this way

279
00:13:01,480 --> 00:13:06,100
as well we've seen for example a lot of

280
00:13:03,880 --> 00:13:07,839
movement in the software composition

281
00:13:06,100 --> 00:13:11,470
analysis market where our big players

282
00:13:07,839 --> 00:13:13,990
actually dancer has bought those kind of

283
00:13:11,470 --> 00:13:17,500
solutions such solutions are integrated

284
00:13:13,990 --> 00:13:19,300
in the same product is is easier for

285
00:13:17,500 --> 00:13:24,370
developers who only use

286
00:13:19,300 --> 00:13:26,800
want to this is chimera my problem

287
00:13:24,370 --> 00:13:28,750
the one we try to develop and we're

288
00:13:26,800 --> 00:13:33,250
actually been working on this even

289
00:13:28,750 --> 00:13:35,670
before the platform itself before docker

290
00:13:33,250 --> 00:13:40,029
was cool before kubernetes what's cool

291
00:13:35,670 --> 00:13:42,579
with in dual and a lot of let's say

292
00:13:40,029 --> 00:13:46,089
tests we've been validating our

293
00:13:42,579 --> 00:13:46,420
hypothesis and we're pretty happy right

294
00:13:46,089 --> 00:13:51,279
now

295
00:13:46,420 --> 00:13:54,010
with the results our users as I said

296
00:13:51,279 --> 00:13:56,140
before are two different kinds of teams

297
00:13:54,010 --> 00:13:58,540
we have developers on one side that want

298
00:13:56,140 --> 00:14:01,089
to include security in the best

299
00:13:58,540 --> 00:14:03,370
scenarios and we have security teams

300
00:14:01,089 --> 00:14:07,959
that want to automate their processes

301
00:14:03,370 --> 00:14:12,339
and our vision are valued proposition

302
00:14:07,959 --> 00:14:15,899
for our product besides using only one

303
00:14:12,339 --> 00:14:19,870
product are these three main points

304
00:14:15,899 --> 00:14:23,170
first thing abstraction of the best

305
00:14:19,870 --> 00:14:25,420
security solutions what we want to our

306
00:14:23,170 --> 00:14:27,839
developers to know is chimera we want

307
00:14:25,420 --> 00:14:30,899
them to get used to our user interface

308
00:14:27,839 --> 00:14:33,820
the way we provide feedback the way we

309
00:14:30,899 --> 00:14:36,670
give information back to them all of

310
00:14:33,820 --> 00:14:41,320
that we don't for example in the docker

311
00:14:36,670 --> 00:14:43,660
image feedback scanning service we don't

312
00:14:41,320 --> 00:14:45,339
wonder want them to work with Claire or

313
00:14:43,660 --> 00:14:47,439
twistlock or aqua not because they are

314
00:14:45,339 --> 00:14:50,290
not good because we actually use those

315
00:14:47,440 --> 00:14:51,940
vendors but we want to want them to know

316
00:14:50,290 --> 00:14:53,949
chimera

317
00:14:51,940 --> 00:14:56,829
because that way if we wanna change

318
00:14:53,950 --> 00:15:00,399
vendor we can do it that way if we wanna

319
00:14:56,829 --> 00:15:02,589
use Claire for one kind of project and

320
00:15:00,399 --> 00:15:04,180
twist work for another kind of project

321
00:15:02,589 --> 00:15:08,140
we can do it but it's the same interface

322
00:15:04,180 --> 00:15:11,859
that's basically our idea the other part

323
00:15:08,140 --> 00:15:15,069
is orchestration I just mentioned one

324
00:15:11,860 --> 00:15:18,760
deciding which tool to use other kind of

325
00:15:15,070 --> 00:15:21,940
for castration is the part of Australian

326
00:15:18,760 --> 00:15:23,410
security services for example in docker

327
00:15:21,940 --> 00:15:26,440
image we still image I'm gonna give you

328
00:15:23,410 --> 00:15:29,589
an example right now because it allows

329
00:15:26,440 --> 00:15:32,860
us to implement policies and it'll also

330
00:15:29,589 --> 00:15:34,840
to implement processes and that's

331
00:15:32,860 --> 00:15:37,300
part of what the product actually do

332
00:15:34,840 --> 00:15:40,270
uses the information we get from their

333
00:15:37,300 --> 00:15:42,459
developers using these services and work

334
00:15:40,270 --> 00:15:47,230
with that and added value is the easiest

335
00:15:42,460 --> 00:15:48,700
one something that a vendor wishes we

336
00:15:47,230 --> 00:15:53,220
don't get from the vendor we implement

337
00:15:48,700 --> 00:15:57,670
it or if we don't get something for from

338
00:15:53,220 --> 00:16:01,810
from the market we implement it as well

339
00:15:57,670 --> 00:16:04,030
okay easy example clear working with

340
00:16:01,810 --> 00:16:07,630
private registries we had to implement

341
00:16:04,030 --> 00:16:09,699
that because there was a very good

342
00:16:07,630 --> 00:16:13,530
prepared with well at the time we did it

343
00:16:09,700 --> 00:16:15,880
with I forgot the doctor history from

344
00:16:13,530 --> 00:16:18,790
Korres but what we had to do it

345
00:16:15,880 --> 00:16:21,760
ourselves so this is our long-term

346
00:16:18,790 --> 00:16:24,130
service football so we're not close to

347
00:16:21,760 --> 00:16:26,410
this not even close

348
00:16:24,130 --> 00:16:29,080
what we decided from all this research

349
00:16:26,410 --> 00:16:31,870
was let's take the pattern that we'll

350
00:16:29,080 --> 00:16:33,190
enjoy the most is basically the I don't

351
00:16:31,870 --> 00:16:36,430
know if you heard of it is the always

352
00:16:33,190 --> 00:16:38,050
upset by blind project Rockit DevOps

353
00:16:36,430 --> 00:16:40,689
Python or something like that and we say

354
00:16:38,050 --> 00:16:42,550
we want to do service for each part of

355
00:16:40,690 --> 00:16:45,760
the pipeline okay

356
00:16:42,550 --> 00:16:50,260
we need to do an intake process we need

357
00:16:45,760 --> 00:16:53,140
to try to do automated trade modeling we

358
00:16:50,260 --> 00:16:56,080
need to provide different kinds of tests

359
00:16:53,140 --> 00:17:00,910
we want to deliver security on the

360
00:16:56,080 --> 00:17:02,620
operations can you hear me yes okay we

361
00:17:00,910 --> 00:17:06,520
want to do deliver security

362
00:17:02,620 --> 00:17:09,369
automate it and we said this is our way

363
00:17:06,520 --> 00:17:11,410
to go obviously we're not there and this

364
00:17:09,369 --> 00:17:13,989
is what we have right now after a year

365
00:17:11,410 --> 00:17:16,540
and a half two years okay we have we

366
00:17:13,990 --> 00:17:20,109
already have three services testing

367
00:17:16,540 --> 00:17:22,810
services sorry one for security code

368
00:17:20,109 --> 00:17:27,129
review one for docker image reviews and

369
00:17:22,810 --> 00:17:28,629
one for for secret reviews those are the

370
00:17:27,130 --> 00:17:31,330
feedback services that we provide for

371
00:17:28,630 --> 00:17:33,400
the developers they can integrate them

372
00:17:31,330 --> 00:17:35,770
it actually is integrated in the in the

373
00:17:33,400 --> 00:17:38,110
global pipelines from the bank but you

374
00:17:35,770 --> 00:17:41,410
cannot actually integrate it in legacy

375
00:17:38,110 --> 00:17:44,379
program platforms as well we have an

376
00:17:41,410 --> 00:17:46,240
intake service because it's a small one

377
00:17:44,380 --> 00:17:46,690
but where we can get to know that there

378
00:17:46,240 --> 00:17:49,360
is a broad

379
00:17:46,690 --> 00:17:52,600
that wants to to use our feedback

380
00:17:49,360 --> 00:17:54,908
services and we have an analytics

381
00:17:52,600 --> 00:17:56,980
service right now it's basically a

382
00:17:54,909 --> 00:17:59,860
dashboard we haven't done much

383
00:17:56,980 --> 00:18:01,899
development development around that

384
00:17:59,860 --> 00:18:03,490
we're using these vendors I'm not

385
00:18:01,899 --> 00:18:05,469
ashamed to say it

386
00:18:03,490 --> 00:18:09,129
they've been great we've worked with

387
00:18:05,470 --> 00:18:11,769
another big set of vendors we are always

388
00:18:09,129 --> 00:18:14,168
looking for the best for each vendor and

389
00:18:11,769 --> 00:18:18,039
they've been very good

390
00:18:14,169 --> 00:18:23,230
special mention the image on the right

391
00:18:18,039 --> 00:18:24,908
the sam'l is a framework enforcement

392
00:18:23,230 --> 00:18:29,159
framework for pipelines

393
00:18:24,909 --> 00:18:31,720
there are DevOps teams is developing

394
00:18:29,159 --> 00:18:33,970
basically what it allows is to implement

395
00:18:31,720 --> 00:18:37,570
behaviors or policies that we want our

396
00:18:33,970 --> 00:18:40,659
developers to to implement in their

397
00:18:37,570 --> 00:18:43,689
pipelines for example if we want some QA

398
00:18:40,659 --> 00:18:48,279
test that they should implement this

399
00:18:43,690 --> 00:18:50,139
does it for them and it's easier for

400
00:18:48,279 --> 00:18:52,419
them and we actually get to enforce some

401
00:18:50,139 --> 00:18:54,100
kind of policies we are connected with

402
00:18:52,419 --> 00:18:55,899
that because obviously security is one

403
00:18:54,100 --> 00:18:58,509
of the things that you want to enforce

404
00:18:55,899 --> 00:19:00,370
we do enforcement by our own but we can

405
00:18:58,509 --> 00:19:04,870
actually connect with that framework and

406
00:19:00,370 --> 00:19:07,299
do things in the pipeline my team at

407
00:19:04,870 --> 00:19:10,989
least or the enterprise security team

408
00:19:07,299 --> 00:19:13,210
right now we're not we don't believe in

409
00:19:10,990 --> 00:19:15,159
breaking the pipeline so that's not the

410
00:19:13,210 --> 00:19:19,259
kind of solution that we're using we are

411
00:19:15,159 --> 00:19:21,429
more around feedback but if that team

412
00:19:19,259 --> 00:19:23,590
decides that they want to do some kind

413
00:19:21,429 --> 00:19:25,480
of enforcement around security or even

414
00:19:23,590 --> 00:19:29,470
ourselves we can use that framework is a

415
00:19:25,480 --> 00:19:30,940
standard for all the platform so is the

416
00:19:29,470 --> 00:19:34,350
example of the kind of things that we're

417
00:19:30,940 --> 00:19:38,710
doing if a developer wants to use

418
00:19:34,350 --> 00:19:40,120
feedback service for docker images one

419
00:19:38,710 --> 00:19:42,159
of the first things that we are gets

420
00:19:40,120 --> 00:19:45,668
ready you should go to Claire or you

421
00:19:42,159 --> 00:19:46,919
should go to twistlock then we set to

422
00:19:45,669 --> 00:19:50,139
twistlock

423
00:19:46,919 --> 00:19:52,840
get me the result from this image please

424
00:19:50,139 --> 00:19:56,168
look does its thing it goes to the

425
00:19:52,840 --> 00:19:59,649
docker registry gets the image get us

426
00:19:56,169 --> 00:20:00,550
the results we get those results we

427
00:19:59,649 --> 00:20:04,540
process them

428
00:20:00,550 --> 00:20:10,629
is normalize them and to our let's say

429
00:20:04,540 --> 00:20:12,610
our data or data model and we actually

430
00:20:10,630 --> 00:20:15,610
do additional things for example we can

431
00:20:12,610 --> 00:20:18,580
calculate some policies on the status of

432
00:20:15,610 --> 00:20:21,370
the image if it has more than two

433
00:20:18,580 --> 00:20:23,949
critical vulnerabilities and then high

434
00:20:21,370 --> 00:20:25,689
vulnerabilities we say that image is not

435
00:20:23,950 --> 00:20:27,850
not going to be able to deploy in our

436
00:20:25,690 --> 00:20:29,950
production environment for example that

437
00:20:27,850 --> 00:20:31,870
kind of stuff and at the time we

438
00:20:29,950 --> 00:20:33,190
developed this service twistlock

439
00:20:31,870 --> 00:20:37,719
I don't know if they have it right now

440
00:20:33,190 --> 00:20:38,410
but they didn't have service where you

441
00:20:37,720 --> 00:20:40,900
can say

442
00:20:38,410 --> 00:20:43,450
give me the differential between this

443
00:20:40,900 --> 00:20:45,730
image and its base image double my

444
00:20:43,450 --> 00:20:47,710
abilities they give you just abilities

445
00:20:45,730 --> 00:20:49,360
for the image you don't get these come

446
00:20:47,710 --> 00:20:51,850
from the base image and these are yours

447
00:20:49,360 --> 00:20:54,100
so we wanted to do that because our base

448
00:20:51,850 --> 00:20:56,110
image sharp or we tried them to be a

449
00:20:54,100 --> 00:20:57,459
standard for the whole bank so we can

450
00:20:56,110 --> 00:20:59,199
say these are actually the

451
00:20:57,460 --> 00:21:03,610
vulnerabilities that you are introducing

452
00:20:59,200 --> 00:21:05,710
right now this is the interface a normal

453
00:21:03,610 --> 00:21:08,379
web interface we give the

454
00:21:05,710 --> 00:21:11,560
vulnerabilities information basically

455
00:21:08,380 --> 00:21:13,150
what twistlock or clear give us the

456
00:21:11,560 --> 00:21:15,129
interesting part here about the added

457
00:21:13,150 --> 00:21:18,310
value from all the value proposition

458
00:21:15,130 --> 00:21:20,470
from obstructing tools this is the same

459
00:21:18,310 --> 00:21:23,230
interface for Claire or for tweaks

460
00:21:20,470 --> 00:21:26,050
twistlock so we don't get interfaces

461
00:21:23,230 --> 00:21:27,880
with Claire we have it here twist lock

462
00:21:26,050 --> 00:21:29,919
has nice interfaces especially for

463
00:21:27,880 --> 00:21:32,110
security teams we have the same here for

464
00:21:29,920 --> 00:21:34,360
the developers this is the part of the

465
00:21:32,110 --> 00:21:37,060
added value that I said the part of

466
00:21:34,360 --> 00:21:40,320
policies so as soon as they scan the

467
00:21:37,060 --> 00:21:45,129
image they know that it won't be able to

468
00:21:40,320 --> 00:21:46,899
deploy on on an environment and they can

469
00:21:45,130 --> 00:21:49,720
check this information inside chimera

470
00:21:46,900 --> 00:21:51,970
well I miss one part of the other

471
00:21:49,720 --> 00:21:53,830
platform we're going to have we're going

472
00:21:51,970 --> 00:21:58,420
to have not we already have a console a

473
00:21:53,830 --> 00:22:00,399
graphical UI for either they can check

474
00:21:58,420 --> 00:22:03,250
this information in the in the ether

475
00:22:00,400 --> 00:22:05,410
console as well the part of the security

476
00:22:03,250 --> 00:22:08,800
team process we use the same service and

477
00:22:05,410 --> 00:22:11,500
the moment we calculate the policies we

478
00:22:08,800 --> 00:22:13,450
do what we call a security seal we go we

479
00:22:11,500 --> 00:22:14,440
take advantage of functionality from

480
00:22:13,450 --> 00:22:17,379
Jeff Regardie factor

481
00:22:14,440 --> 00:22:20,519
that allows us to put metadata

482
00:22:17,379 --> 00:22:24,519
properties are calling artifactory and

483
00:22:20,519 --> 00:22:28,149
just beside the artifact in this case

484
00:22:24,519 --> 00:22:30,309
the docker image we put the seal the

485
00:22:28,149 --> 00:22:33,428
good thing about this is that chimera

486
00:22:30,309 --> 00:22:37,178
doesn't have to be up for deployment

487
00:22:33,429 --> 00:22:39,820
process to check if the image is good

488
00:22:37,179 --> 00:22:41,620
for deployment or not and the good thing

489
00:22:39,820 --> 00:22:43,629
for security teams they don't have to

490
00:22:41,620 --> 00:22:45,340
intervene nobody can say I need to

491
00:22:43,629 --> 00:22:47,860
deploy that image because it's automatic

492
00:22:45,340 --> 00:22:49,330
you either can or you know okay

493
00:22:47,860 --> 00:22:52,269
obviously it's a bank so we have

494
00:22:49,330 --> 00:22:55,539
overwrite processes but just in case

495
00:22:52,269 --> 00:22:58,049
someone says you need to do it but at

496
00:22:55,539 --> 00:23:01,000
least we have the automatic way okay and

497
00:22:58,049 --> 00:23:02,950
that was the part of the product in what

498
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:06,490
about a lot of stuff what we're doing on

499
00:23:02,950 --> 00:23:09,759
the labs team the lab seem is a great

500
00:23:06,490 --> 00:23:13,450
guys they know a lot they're great

501
00:23:09,759 --> 00:23:17,259
the what we're trying to achieve what

502
00:23:13,450 --> 00:23:20,049
they're trying to achieve is apply new

503
00:23:17,259 --> 00:23:24,340
practices for an important problem they

504
00:23:20,049 --> 00:23:27,429
actually doing this for a real problem a

505
00:23:24,340 --> 00:23:30,730
real product they are developing and the

506
00:23:27,429 --> 00:23:33,519
lab steam they're trying to come up with

507
00:23:30,730 --> 00:23:36,490
tools or concepts or research and how

508
00:23:33,519 --> 00:23:38,200
they can adapt the security from the

509
00:23:36,490 --> 00:23:40,090
recent Alice's stage from the thread

510
00:23:38,200 --> 00:23:41,950
modeling until the operation problem

511
00:23:40,090 --> 00:23:45,449
okay they for example they they have

512
00:23:41,950 --> 00:23:48,009
released research about vulnerabilities

513
00:23:45,450 --> 00:23:49,690
it's the example this is open source as

514
00:23:48,009 --> 00:23:51,879
I said before we believe in that where

515
00:23:49,690 --> 00:23:54,820
we can especially the lab scene they

516
00:23:51,879 --> 00:23:59,590
have developed some pretty nice proof of

517
00:23:54,820 --> 00:24:02,168
concept or products that for these

518
00:23:59,590 --> 00:24:04,240
problems that they have research and the

519
00:24:02,169 --> 00:24:09,580
interesting part here is not this is not

520
00:24:04,240 --> 00:24:11,649
a final let's say very mature product

521
00:24:09,580 --> 00:24:13,750
because he's a lab steam but they have

522
00:24:11,649 --> 00:24:15,219
research and they have come up with nice

523
00:24:13,750 --> 00:24:18,789
ideas of how to tackle these problems

524
00:24:15,220 --> 00:24:21,700
for example the last one get SEC it's

525
00:24:18,789 --> 00:24:23,710
not the result they get for secrets of

526
00:24:21,700 --> 00:24:27,009
finding secrets in repositories it's the

527
00:24:23,710 --> 00:24:28,690
way they do it they they use bill bot

528
00:24:27,009 --> 00:24:32,360
which is

529
00:24:28,690 --> 00:24:34,960
Python framework for CI for continuous

530
00:24:32,360 --> 00:24:38,090
integration and they reuse it to launch

531
00:24:34,960 --> 00:24:40,100
different kinds of tools that search for

532
00:24:38,090 --> 00:24:42,918
secrets in repository so they don't use

533
00:24:40,100 --> 00:24:45,830
the drop or truffle hog or any other

534
00:24:42,919 --> 00:24:49,220
they can actually orchestrate to launch

535
00:24:45,830 --> 00:24:51,439
many of them and if you want to add

536
00:24:49,220 --> 00:24:53,690
another one you just put a wrapper

537
00:24:51,440 --> 00:24:57,230
around the tool and it works the same

538
00:24:53,690 --> 00:25:00,220
okay as I say old they always tell me

539
00:24:57,230 --> 00:25:02,600
there are pretty obsessed about

540
00:25:00,220 --> 00:25:06,110
extendibility they want to have

541
00:25:02,600 --> 00:25:09,199
everything blogging or less a model

542
00:25:06,110 --> 00:25:12,379
ready and most of the things that they

543
00:25:09,200 --> 00:25:14,179
do is around that okay deep Tracy and

544
00:25:12,380 --> 00:25:16,720
pattern for example this I wonder on the

545
00:25:14,179 --> 00:25:20,380
research what they try to achieve is to

546
00:25:16,720 --> 00:25:23,690
normalize a way that libraries names

547
00:25:20,380 --> 00:25:27,320
translate to CPS so they can translate

548
00:25:23,690 --> 00:25:32,500
it to CVS okay that's the idea of

549
00:25:27,320 --> 00:25:36,230
pattern either software solution or even

550
00:25:32,500 --> 00:25:40,399
operating system information and deep

551
00:25:36,230 --> 00:25:43,340
Tracy the added value from from deep

552
00:25:40,399 --> 00:25:45,860
Tracy is the idea that you have a single

553
00:25:43,340 --> 00:25:49,519
product that orchestrates different

554
00:25:45,860 --> 00:25:52,459
analyzers okay so you have an analyzer

555
00:25:49,519 --> 00:25:55,220
for each technology or if each language

556
00:25:52,460 --> 00:25:58,250
which you can want to get dependency

557
00:25:55,220 --> 00:26:00,590
tree so you have is all docker obviously

558
00:25:58,250 --> 00:26:03,409
and you have a docker image for getting

559
00:26:00,590 --> 00:26:05,720
python dependencies you have a java

560
00:26:03,409 --> 00:26:07,940
image for getting java dependencies if

561
00:26:05,720 --> 00:26:10,460
you need to escalate because you have a

562
00:26:07,940 --> 00:26:11,360
lot of Java projects and you launch a

563
00:26:10,460 --> 00:26:13,519
lot of Java

564
00:26:11,360 --> 00:26:18,260
note that kind of things that's part of

565
00:26:13,519 --> 00:26:19,940
the solution add a DS roughly for that

566
00:26:18,260 --> 00:26:21,080
problem that feedback service that we

567
00:26:19,940 --> 00:26:24,019
want to provide as well we're actually

568
00:26:21,080 --> 00:26:26,269
working with them to mature this and try

569
00:26:24,019 --> 00:26:29,480
to integrate it inside our product for

570
00:26:26,269 --> 00:26:32,090
example if you say I wanna get a status

571
00:26:29,480 --> 00:26:33,950
of my code we can say if you have

572
00:26:32,090 --> 00:26:35,840
vulnerabilities in your code if you have

573
00:26:33,950 --> 00:26:38,750
owner abilities in your dependencies and

574
00:26:35,840 --> 00:26:40,220
if you have secrets inside your

575
00:26:38,750 --> 00:26:41,059
repository for example and if you're

576
00:26:40,220 --> 00:26:43,159
just

577
00:26:41,059 --> 00:26:46,249
one report with that information that's

578
00:26:43,159 --> 00:26:48,649
part of what we do in chimera and that

579
00:26:46,249 --> 00:26:52,340
was a lab steam the 13 I think I have

580
00:26:48,649 --> 00:26:55,939
time all the laps team the third team is

581
00:26:52,340 --> 00:26:57,820
blue team the blue team decided they

582
00:26:55,940 --> 00:27:00,679
need to change the way they operate

583
00:26:57,820 --> 00:27:04,399
because they couldn't be they couldn't

584
00:27:00,679 --> 00:27:07,850
keep being the cop at the end and they

585
00:27:04,399 --> 00:27:10,248
do that as well because depends on the

586
00:27:07,850 --> 00:27:13,219
project and they provide a service that

587
00:27:10,249 --> 00:27:16,519
they call continued security analysis is

588
00:27:13,220 --> 00:27:19,220
the translation the SCI ACS and these

589
00:27:16,519 --> 00:27:22,879
are service for BBVA worldwide for all

590
00:27:19,220 --> 00:27:25,759
the countries it's free which is a good

591
00:27:22,879 --> 00:27:28,668
thing because inside the bank projects

592
00:27:25,759 --> 00:27:31,970
have to pay for the final check at the

593
00:27:28,669 --> 00:27:33,440
end where the cop says no so you have to

594
00:27:31,970 --> 00:27:37,330
get budget for that in this case

595
00:27:33,440 --> 00:27:40,519
projects doesn't need it and once they

596
00:27:37,330 --> 00:27:42,350
they launch scans for one project they

597
00:27:40,519 --> 00:27:44,960
keep scanning that's why they call that

598
00:27:42,350 --> 00:27:48,498
continues okay so once you're in there

599
00:27:44,960 --> 00:27:51,049
in their watch you keep on their watch

600
00:27:48,499 --> 00:27:54,230
they have manual or API sore jinkies

601
00:27:51,049 --> 00:27:57,049
libraries for integrating interesting

602
00:27:54,230 --> 00:27:58,730
part for some projects they can use it

603
00:27:57,049 --> 00:28:01,879
for compliance they can go for example

604
00:27:58,730 --> 00:28:05,529
in the Central Bank Spain and say this

605
00:28:01,879 --> 00:28:08,658
this project has been checked and

606
00:28:05,529 --> 00:28:10,970
interesting part here they do manual

607
00:28:08,659 --> 00:28:12,860
resource processing they keep checking

608
00:28:10,970 --> 00:28:15,080
the results and then they give it to

609
00:28:12,860 --> 00:28:17,539
developers that's a difference with us

610
00:28:15,080 --> 00:28:20,240
right now they do the triage they find

611
00:28:17,539 --> 00:28:22,070
the code they they do it obviously they

612
00:28:20,240 --> 00:28:24,139
know that's not gonna escalate for the

613
00:28:22,070 --> 00:28:25,970
new platform because we're going on a

614
00:28:24,139 --> 00:28:28,248
DevOps mindset and they're working with

615
00:28:25,970 --> 00:28:30,110
us on how to do it but this is what they

616
00:28:28,249 --> 00:28:33,139
have right now they can work with

617
00:28:30,110 --> 00:28:34,580
different kinds of repository right now

618
00:28:33,139 --> 00:28:40,449
we are prepared for the platform which

619
00:28:34,580 --> 00:28:43,309
is a standardized repository they do the

620
00:28:40,450 --> 00:28:46,659
they start the scan

621
00:28:43,309 --> 00:28:49,730
they scan on different analyzers as well

622
00:28:46,659 --> 00:28:52,309
and the part of interesting as I said

623
00:28:49,730 --> 00:28:54,800
before is a triage of results and they

624
00:28:52,309 --> 00:28:56,389
give feedback for the developers

625
00:28:54,800 --> 00:28:58,580
right now we're working with them

626
00:28:56,390 --> 00:29:01,940
because next year they want to move that

627
00:28:58,580 --> 00:29:03,740
to chimera that part of scanning and

628
00:29:01,940 --> 00:29:08,030
getting the results and not using their

629
00:29:03,740 --> 00:29:09,440
their process but they still want for

630
00:29:08,030 --> 00:29:11,870
some projects and that's the part we're

631
00:29:09,440 --> 00:29:13,820
trying to see how we do it to provide

632
00:29:11,870 --> 00:29:15,919
feedback services to teach the

633
00:29:13,820 --> 00:29:19,250
developers for example based on risk or

634
00:29:15,920 --> 00:29:20,930
if they if we need them to check special

635
00:29:19,250 --> 00:29:22,910
projects because the thread modeling

636
00:29:20,930 --> 00:29:24,860
that we did say this is a very important

637
00:29:22,910 --> 00:29:27,140
project and we don't want just the

638
00:29:24,860 --> 00:29:29,330
developers to get feedback and change

639
00:29:27,140 --> 00:29:31,760
stuff but we want a final check at the

640
00:29:29,330 --> 00:29:33,260
end anyway from the blue team that's

641
00:29:31,760 --> 00:29:36,740
part of the orchestration that we think

642
00:29:33,260 --> 00:29:38,960
we can offer next year and keep the blue

643
00:29:36,740 --> 00:29:40,370
team in the in the loop we don't believe

644
00:29:38,960 --> 00:29:44,080
that the blue team is going to disappear

645
00:29:40,370 --> 00:29:47,300
all the other stuff we actually believe

646
00:29:44,080 --> 00:29:51,290
they are the ones that are more prepared

647
00:29:47,300 --> 00:29:52,909
to teach developers are to to change the

648
00:29:51,290 --> 00:29:56,629
way they develop around knowledge

649
00:29:52,910 --> 00:29:58,790
so even we're trying to see if we can

650
00:29:56,630 --> 00:30:01,130
put them in the loop and have some kind

651
00:29:58,790 --> 00:30:04,639
of uncle service or something like that

652
00:30:01,130 --> 00:30:08,590
for projects as well and that was the

653
00:30:04,640 --> 00:30:12,650
technological side on the culture side

654
00:30:08,590 --> 00:30:14,510
all three teams are working with all the

655
00:30:12,650 --> 00:30:16,730
initiatives around transformation that

656
00:30:14,510 --> 00:30:19,300
we have in the bank and the human

657
00:30:16,730 --> 00:30:23,240
resources transformation project and

658
00:30:19,300 --> 00:30:25,460
either if it's called tribe clan guild

659
00:30:23,240 --> 00:30:28,190
anything any fancy name that you want

660
00:30:25,460 --> 00:30:30,290
that is working around DevOps we go

661
00:30:28,190 --> 00:30:33,200
there and we say if you're gonna do

662
00:30:30,290 --> 00:30:35,690
DevOps you should do sorry you should

663
00:30:33,200 --> 00:30:38,420
change the way you do security as well

664
00:30:35,690 --> 00:30:42,410
you should include security and do DEP

665
00:30:38,420 --> 00:30:44,270
SEC ops okay we're basically teaching

666
00:30:42,410 --> 00:30:47,570
them how to do it we're trying this is

667
00:30:44,270 --> 00:30:51,260
just starting because it's hard for us

668
00:30:47,570 --> 00:30:53,990
to to get there sometime and this is in

669
00:30:51,260 --> 00:30:56,060
the let's say the human part we also

670
00:30:53,990 --> 00:30:59,180
have a project inside the bank it's a

671
00:30:56,060 --> 00:31:01,190
ninja project it's an internal education

672
00:30:59,180 --> 00:31:03,200
project not only for developers

673
00:31:01,190 --> 00:31:06,710
especially for developers but not only

674
00:31:03,200 --> 00:31:08,780
for developers even for business people

675
00:31:06,710 --> 00:31:13,430
even for security people's

676
00:31:08,780 --> 00:31:15,260
and we try to have content that we can

677
00:31:13,430 --> 00:31:17,750
provide for this education project

678
00:31:15,260 --> 00:31:19,460
around all this stuff that that we're

679
00:31:17,750 --> 00:31:23,210
talking about how to change security and

680
00:31:19,460 --> 00:31:26,510
all of that this is what we have right

681
00:31:23,210 --> 00:31:29,480
now we feel as a science s very

682
00:31:26,510 --> 00:31:31,210
optimistic we have proven our hypothesis

683
00:31:29,480 --> 00:31:35,230
from the last few years

684
00:31:31,210 --> 00:31:38,930
correctly we believe that we're gonna

685
00:31:35,230 --> 00:31:41,600
were on the right path but it doesn't

686
00:31:38,930 --> 00:31:43,610
end here we just started at least for

687
00:31:41,600 --> 00:31:46,790
next year this is what we have fun on

688
00:31:43,610 --> 00:31:49,699
the roadmap we wanna come with some kind

689
00:31:46,790 --> 00:31:51,680
of MVP for dynamic testing as well it's

690
00:31:49,700 --> 00:31:53,720
a good thing for us because as I said

691
00:31:51,680 --> 00:31:57,380
the platform is very standard so we know

692
00:31:53,720 --> 00:31:58,970
how we can come up with an QA

693
00:31:57,380 --> 00:32:02,570
environment where we can not run a

694
00:31:58,970 --> 00:32:04,430
dynamic testing this is just a

695
00:32:02,570 --> 00:32:07,399
hypothesis we see how we're going to do

696
00:32:04,430 --> 00:32:08,120
it the automatic try ash or something we

697
00:32:07,400 --> 00:32:11,450
want to do it

698
00:32:08,120 --> 00:32:14,560
next years as well as I say we want to

699
00:32:11,450 --> 00:32:17,330
integrate the blue team's process and

700
00:32:14,560 --> 00:32:20,450
integrate the tools from the labs team

701
00:32:17,330 --> 00:32:21,830
and on the cultural side next year is

702
00:32:20,450 --> 00:32:24,880
going to be a good year for us because

703
00:32:21,830 --> 00:32:27,620
we're actually just starting to work on

704
00:32:24,880 --> 00:32:29,570
formalizing new tracks on Deficit cops

705
00:32:27,620 --> 00:32:32,929
in the Ninja another program we have to

706
00:32:29,570 --> 00:32:34,010
code tag you and thing we're trying to

707
00:32:32,930 --> 00:32:36,080
push we don't know if we're going to

708
00:32:34,010 --> 00:32:38,060
have a dress ready but we want some pad

709
00:32:36,080 --> 00:32:39,830
some kind of pilot on security champions

710
00:32:38,060 --> 00:32:44,800
we don't have that right now

711
00:32:39,830 --> 00:32:48,649
but we're trying to to do it anyway so

712
00:32:44,800 --> 00:32:50,149
as you could see I didn't present a

713
00:32:48,650 --> 00:32:52,850
magic formula you know you cannot take

714
00:32:50,150 --> 00:32:54,710
this and do it in another Bank I just

715
00:32:52,850 --> 00:32:57,620
want you to have a sneak peek of what

716
00:32:54,710 --> 00:33:00,520
we're doing and half inspiration to to

717
00:32:57,620 --> 00:33:04,310
do it in your organization's as well

718
00:33:00,520 --> 00:33:07,610
it's been a good ride obviously our

719
00:33:04,310 --> 00:33:09,919
context or problems are very good for us

720
00:33:07,610 --> 00:33:14,330
because we have all this personalization

721
00:33:09,920 --> 00:33:16,820
and all these things that we can take

722
00:33:14,330 --> 00:33:19,399
advantage of but I think you can take

723
00:33:16,820 --> 00:33:21,620
some ideas for example the

724
00:33:19,400 --> 00:33:22,640
standardization if you think that you

725
00:33:21,620 --> 00:33:25,100
can stand the rice one

726
00:33:22,640 --> 00:33:29,060
process and you can apply security that

727
00:33:25,100 --> 00:33:31,730
in that process in an automated way my I

728
00:33:29,060 --> 00:33:34,780
would say take the chance try it because

729
00:33:31,730 --> 00:33:38,150
it's gonna allow you to to do a lot and

730
00:33:34,780 --> 00:33:40,940
I hope this was interesting if you have

731
00:33:38,150 --> 00:33:52,310
any question right now or later in the

732
00:33:40,940 --> 00:33:56,740
vendors area thank you thank you very

733
00:33:52,310 --> 00:33:56,740
much a nice - any questions when Esther

734
00:34:06,539 --> 00:34:12,449
just like is a great opportunity you've

735
00:34:10,230 --> 00:34:14,339
had in a bank to develop something I was

736
00:34:12,449 --> 00:34:16,199
wondering how many people or developers

737
00:34:14,339 --> 00:34:19,349
actually have building these services

738
00:34:16,199 --> 00:34:23,219
and tools focused on security they have

739
00:34:19,349 --> 00:34:28,429
set house few people's my product we

740
00:34:23,219 --> 00:34:31,638
started with a developer's a scrum team

741
00:34:28,429 --> 00:34:34,079
we're actually using the same

742
00:34:31,639 --> 00:34:35,549
methodologies and the same mindset of

743
00:34:34,079 --> 00:34:38,750
DevOps and agile and all of that

744
00:34:35,549 --> 00:34:41,429
we're trying to put a hypotheses work

745
00:34:38,750 --> 00:34:43,829
prove it if it not we change it we

746
00:34:41,429 --> 00:34:47,000
change priorities a lot for example when

747
00:34:43,829 --> 00:34:49,069
we started docker images the bank

748
00:34:47,000 --> 00:34:51,239
believed that was going to be the

749
00:34:49,069 --> 00:34:53,849
standard platform right now we're

750
00:34:51,239 --> 00:34:57,689
switching back to visual images so my

751
00:34:53,849 --> 00:34:59,700
strategic choices so we had two people

752
00:34:57,690 --> 00:35:01,619
and start working on other services that

753
00:34:59,700 --> 00:35:03,569
were more important than docker images

754
00:35:01,619 --> 00:35:05,700
that nobody was going to use it so we

755
00:35:03,569 --> 00:35:08,279
use a yell and with a DevOps team sorry

756
00:35:05,700 --> 00:35:11,098
a scrum team we we do what we're doing

757
00:35:08,279 --> 00:35:14,819
chimera I would like to get more

758
00:35:11,099 --> 00:35:16,740
developers and do escalated scrum team

759
00:35:14,819 --> 00:35:22,170
but it's what we get right now because

760
00:35:16,740 --> 00:35:25,019
we're actually in sauna hypothesis so

761
00:35:22,170 --> 00:35:26,579
we're trying to present to our superiors

762
00:35:25,019 --> 00:35:28,709
that this is a good idea and this is a

763
00:35:26,579 --> 00:35:31,440
way to go so we can get more financed

764
00:35:28,710 --> 00:35:34,650
the Lapps team they they are lapse team

765
00:35:31,440 --> 00:35:36,599
so they do two three week sprints and

766
00:35:34,650 --> 00:35:40,230
that's it they don't do more than that

767
00:35:36,599 --> 00:35:42,809
they test their research their ideas I

768
00:35:40,230 --> 00:35:45,740
move on for the next idea so it's a

769
00:35:42,809 --> 00:35:47,910
small team right now we have some

770
00:35:45,740 --> 00:35:51,029
architects on the bank working on the

771
00:35:47,910 --> 00:35:52,859
more let's say politics size of saying

772
00:35:51,029 --> 00:35:55,650
you have to do this and that but from a

773
00:35:52,859 --> 00:36:01,410
developing developer point of view is a

774
00:35:55,650 --> 00:36:04,079
small team well one thing I forgot to

775
00:36:01,410 --> 00:36:07,379
mention sorry it's an interesting thing

776
00:36:04,079 --> 00:36:09,660
and what's related to the to the talk

777
00:36:07,380 --> 00:36:11,069
title the part of breaking the bank one

778
00:36:09,660 --> 00:36:16,250
of the things that we're orchestrating

779
00:36:11,069 --> 00:36:19,860
is using for example if we can using few

780
00:36:16,250 --> 00:36:23,160
licenses from vendor solution to

781
00:36:19,860 --> 00:36:25,020
our ideas and then we can prove to our

782
00:36:23,160 --> 00:36:28,350
superiors that the idea works and then

783
00:36:25,020 --> 00:36:30,720
get more license that if we need them to

784
00:36:28,350 --> 00:36:32,310
escalate our processes okay so as part

785
00:36:30,720 --> 00:36:35,069
of the orchestration that we can get for

786
00:36:32,310 --> 00:36:38,130
example if I get ten licenses for a

787
00:36:35,070 --> 00:36:42,480
product I can run only ten scans for

788
00:36:38,130 --> 00:36:45,150
example then I run ten scans I control

789
00:36:42,480 --> 00:36:46,740
the queue in the in that process it's

790
00:36:45,150 --> 00:36:53,070
part of the orchestration with I forgot

791
00:36:46,740 --> 00:36:56,149
to mention it earlier sorry information

792
00:36:53,070 --> 00:36:58,860
or insights into the security

793
00:36:56,150 --> 00:37:02,610
transformation program and for culture

794
00:36:58,860 --> 00:37:04,590
so particularly the security champions

795
00:37:02,610 --> 00:37:07,620
how you integrated that maybe in two

796
00:37:04,590 --> 00:37:11,400
sprints no the security champions part

797
00:37:07,620 --> 00:37:14,790
we're planning it for next year we're

798
00:37:11,400 --> 00:37:18,780
trying to yes yeah sorry we we haven't

799
00:37:14,790 --> 00:37:21,210
being able to do it not it's not because

800
00:37:18,780 --> 00:37:23,690
of technology but more because DevOps

801
00:37:21,210 --> 00:37:27,330
teams are very focused on for example

802
00:37:23,690 --> 00:37:29,430
changing the way that you they do QA is

803
00:37:27,330 --> 00:37:31,560
changing a lot for them and it's more

804
00:37:29,430 --> 00:37:33,660
natural for them so their focus this

805
00:37:31,560 --> 00:37:36,450
year in that and we already started

806
00:37:33,660 --> 00:37:38,009
talking with that team that is taking

807
00:37:36,450 --> 00:37:40,040
the transformation to DevOps and say

808
00:37:38,010 --> 00:37:42,720
next year we want to do security

809
00:37:40,040 --> 00:37:48,810
apparently they say yes but we have to

810
00:37:42,720 --> 00:37:51,149
wake depends on priorities hi I have a

811
00:37:48,810 --> 00:37:53,610
question how do you integrate security

812
00:37:51,150 --> 00:37:55,800
into your scrum teams I know there's the

813
00:37:53,610 --> 00:37:58,440
idea of t-shaped people but most of the

814
00:37:55,800 --> 00:38:01,080
time and there's just one person who

815
00:37:58,440 --> 00:38:04,200
focus on security in scrum teams so how

816
00:38:01,080 --> 00:38:06,600
do you guys do that right now we're

817
00:38:04,200 --> 00:38:09,450
focused on providing feedback services

818
00:38:06,600 --> 00:38:12,150
we want them to to use them their

819
00:38:09,450 --> 00:38:15,540
developers an interesting part here this

820
00:38:12,150 --> 00:38:17,760
is a platform for banking developers the

821
00:38:15,540 --> 00:38:21,360
developers that are gonna develop the

822
00:38:17,760 --> 00:38:24,720
banking services right now there's a few

823
00:38:21,360 --> 00:38:27,180
of them we work close with them and tell

824
00:38:24,720 --> 00:38:28,560
them to use feedback services but we're

825
00:38:27,180 --> 00:38:31,379
mostly working with the guys

826
00:38:28,560 --> 00:38:33,420
developing the platform itself so it's

827
00:38:31,380 --> 00:38:37,330
different kind of

828
00:38:33,420 --> 00:38:41,500
let's say developing and that they're

829
00:38:37,330 --> 00:38:43,330
doing because the the business

830
00:38:41,500 --> 00:38:45,730
developers are going to be very standard

831
00:38:43,330 --> 00:38:47,470
they're going to be using the same

832
00:38:45,730 --> 00:38:50,500
technologies the same processes all of

833
00:38:47,470 --> 00:38:52,240
that the platform developers each

834
00:38:50,500 --> 00:38:55,270
platform for example or platform is

835
00:38:52,240 --> 00:38:57,939
using Nomad for deploying our services

836
00:38:55,270 --> 00:39:00,190
another thing is using kubernetes and

837
00:38:57,940 --> 00:39:02,800
other team is using I'm talking on

838
00:39:00,190 --> 00:39:05,710
deployment but the developer part is the

839
00:39:02,800 --> 00:39:08,380
same it's different so we're trying to

840
00:39:05,710 --> 00:39:10,870
work with them and say you have this V

841
00:39:08,380 --> 00:39:13,230
feedback service as well you can use it

842
00:39:10,870 --> 00:39:16,569
you can integrate it but the part of

843
00:39:13,230 --> 00:39:18,930
change in the way they they do inside

844
00:39:16,570 --> 00:39:21,700
inside the teams it's the security

845
00:39:18,930 --> 00:39:25,180
champions pilot that we want to do next

846
00:39:21,700 --> 00:39:28,149
year basically right now we have a lot

847
00:39:25,180 --> 00:39:30,460
of technology well a lot small part of

848
00:39:28,150 --> 00:39:32,650
culture we're mostly educating our

849
00:39:30,460 --> 00:39:35,410
developers trying to provide them the

850
00:39:32,650 --> 00:39:38,200
feedback services in some important

851
00:39:35,410 --> 00:39:40,390
steps if we want to force them we do it

852
00:39:38,200 --> 00:39:44,290
it's not our philosophy but if we want

853
00:39:40,390 --> 00:39:47,310
to do it we can do it next year that's

854
00:39:44,290 --> 00:39:47,310
why I say we just started

855
00:39:55,990 --> 00:40:05,689
now how many of those 12,000 developers

856
00:40:01,220 --> 00:40:08,779
are using Chamara today a few of them as

857
00:40:05,690 --> 00:40:11,060
I said the last question we just have a

858
00:40:08,780 --> 00:40:14,210
few teams using the platform and the

859
00:40:11,060 --> 00:40:15,619
developers of the platform right now we

860
00:40:14,210 --> 00:40:18,650
don't have a number because we don't

861
00:40:15,619 --> 00:40:22,520
count developers we we get projects

862
00:40:18,650 --> 00:40:26,180
teams but I believe we have around 200

863
00:40:22,520 --> 00:40:28,369
300 projects working on with the void

864
00:40:26,180 --> 00:40:29,720
chimera have you said any goals to

865
00:40:28,369 --> 00:40:32,150
increase that number

866
00:40:29,720 --> 00:40:34,850
no we don't have goals right now for

867
00:40:32,150 --> 00:40:37,190
next year they are requesting some KPIs

868
00:40:34,850 --> 00:40:39,950
and goals and metrics and all of that

869
00:40:37,190 --> 00:40:41,810
but next year is I didn't say it before

870
00:40:39,950 --> 00:40:44,140
but this platform is not production

871
00:40:41,810 --> 00:40:47,630
already the date for production release

872
00:40:44,140 --> 00:40:51,049
not chimera day after platform is next

873
00:40:47,630 --> 00:40:53,030
year so next year is wearing when we

874
00:40:51,050 --> 00:40:56,240
know how many developers are gonna

875
00:40:53,030 --> 00:40:59,960
actually use a platform or what the

876
00:40:56,240 --> 00:41:02,270
platform itself goal is and from that

877
00:40:59,960 --> 00:41:06,650
goal we can say well from those let's

878
00:41:02,270 --> 00:41:08,810
say 10% projects we want 50% of the

879
00:41:06,650 --> 00:41:12,920
developers that's for next year and one

880
00:41:08,810 --> 00:41:15,710
last thing if you don't mind is it ready

881
00:41:12,920 --> 00:41:18,609
for legacy projects legacy technologies

882
00:41:15,710 --> 00:41:21,200
I know banks have a lot of legacy yeah

883
00:41:18,609 --> 00:41:24,799
will those things be able to use schema

884
00:41:21,200 --> 00:41:28,520
as well the idea is that they're mainly

885
00:41:24,800 --> 00:41:30,950
focused on the new platform we have for

886
00:41:28,520 --> 00:41:33,230
example the part of easily integrated

887
00:41:30,950 --> 00:41:36,319
integrating with chimera we have

888
00:41:33,230 --> 00:41:40,400
developed some SDKs for Jenkins or CLI

889
00:41:36,320 --> 00:41:43,130
ingo for executing our our services but

890
00:41:40,400 --> 00:41:47,240
as I said before the legacy part is

891
00:41:43,130 --> 00:41:48,680
mostly the blue team's job right now and

892
00:41:47,240 --> 00:41:51,140
that's a strategy we're trying to

893
00:41:48,680 --> 00:41:53,390
achieve we're trying that the blue team

894
00:41:51,140 --> 00:41:56,810
switch to chimera but they're still

895
00:41:53,390 --> 00:42:00,640
going to use their service and then try

896
00:41:56,810 --> 00:42:00,640
to move the load to chimera

897
00:42:02,140 --> 00:42:07,150
yep so sorry yeah I noticed something

898
00:42:04,420 --> 00:42:08,440
you had devs hiccups threat modeling can

899
00:42:07,150 --> 00:42:11,079
you elaborate on maybe what your plans

900
00:42:08,440 --> 00:42:13,450
are with that no right now we don't know

901
00:42:11,079 --> 00:42:18,130
how we're gonna do it we have made some

902
00:42:13,450 --> 00:42:19,839
POC some research but we're still

903
00:42:18,130 --> 00:42:22,119
checking the market we know that the

904
00:42:19,839 --> 00:42:24,400
market has evolved this last year we

905
00:42:22,119 --> 00:42:26,529
actually have a product in the bank that

906
00:42:24,400 --> 00:42:28,420
around threat modeling that we believe

907
00:42:26,529 --> 00:42:32,650
that we will be able to use it actually

908
00:42:28,420 --> 00:42:34,720
the Lapps team their mold their biggest

909
00:42:32,650 --> 00:42:38,650
focus right now is around around trade

910
00:42:34,720 --> 00:42:40,569
modeling sorry I've got to put an end to

911
00:42:38,650 --> 00:42:43,269
your questions for the thank you very

912
00:42:40,569 --> 00:42:48,400
much a nest oh there's plenty of time

913

for the next two days so now we're just

914
00:42:48,400 --> 00:42:52,210
going to obviously we've got the talk

here and Iran is doing workshop

918
00:42:58,059 --> 00:43:01,630
downstairs on threat modeling so we're

919
00:43:00,309 --> 00:43:02,750
just going to start again banging up to

920
