1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:03,958
so yeah I hate to be the introduced as

2
00:00:02,280 --> 00:00:06,180
being the the last bastion there between

3
00:00:03,959 --> 00:00:08,580
you and your lunch and I'm gonna try met

4
00:00:06,180 --> 00:00:10,200
as interesting as possible but that what

5
00:00:08,580 --> 00:00:13,200
about me so my name is Matthew

6
00:00:10,200 --> 00:00:15,389
Pendlebury or Matt or Matty depending on

7
00:00:13,200 --> 00:00:18,210
whether you are a my mother or a

8
00:00:15,389 --> 00:00:20,430
colleague or a client or friend I'm

9
00:00:18,210 --> 00:00:22,740
happy to respond to all of those I

10
00:00:20,430 --> 00:00:24,420
started off as a developer how I've

11
00:00:22,740 --> 00:00:26,400
worked into Safa development for 17

12
00:00:24,420 --> 00:00:28,349
years managing software development

13
00:00:26,400 --> 00:00:31,140
processes and then I jumped the fence

14
00:00:28,349 --> 00:00:34,020
now what with MWR in for security where

15
00:00:31,140 --> 00:00:35,969
I get to well-flavored security things

16
00:00:34,020 --> 00:00:38,040
clearly and I also try and push a lot of

17
00:00:35,969 --> 00:00:40,110
this back into my sort of passion for

18
00:00:38,040 --> 00:00:42,690
security back into development so that's

19
00:00:40,110 --> 00:00:45,629
kind of where I've coming from so this

20
00:00:42,690 --> 00:00:47,280
is me hopefully talking to you guys

21
00:00:45,629 --> 00:00:51,329
about one of the most interesting ideas

22
00:00:47,280 --> 00:00:53,989
that's kind of come across my world for

23
00:00:51,329 --> 00:00:56,850
a little while so start talking about

24
00:00:53,989 --> 00:01:00,000
attack aware applications how am I going

25
00:00:56,850 --> 00:01:01,530
to do it so first off what do I mean by

26
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,789
attack aware applications there's a bit

27
00:01:01,530 --> 00:01:03,870
of confusion here and I'll start to try

28
00:01:02,789 --> 00:01:07,740
to explain that a few through a few

29
00:01:03,870 --> 00:01:10,259
examples where's the idea originated

30
00:01:07,740 --> 00:01:11,429
from a little bit of that what we what

31
00:01:10,260 --> 00:01:13,020
we have what's happening in the space

32
00:01:11,430 --> 00:01:14,400
where can we go with it what might be

33
00:01:13,020 --> 00:01:16,140
happening what might be developing on it

34
00:01:14,400 --> 00:01:17,340
what can you do with it because I think

35
00:01:16,140 --> 00:01:19,799
there are things that you guys can do

36
00:01:17,340 --> 00:01:21,150
with it pretty much right now or at

37
00:01:19,799 --> 00:01:23,310
least when you get back to you over to

38
00:01:21,150 --> 00:01:25,470
your various offices and other places of

39
00:01:23,310 --> 00:01:26,970
work and a couple of other future

40
00:01:25,470 --> 00:01:28,170
thoughts which something just kind of

41
00:01:26,970 --> 00:01:30,509
cropped up and I thought I wonder

42
00:01:28,170 --> 00:01:32,220
whether that fits in as well so let's

43
00:01:30,509 --> 00:01:34,650
move straight on to what do I mean by

44
00:01:32,220 --> 00:01:37,560
attack aware applications so that's a

45
00:01:34,650 --> 00:01:41,250
bit of a problem with this I'm known by

46
00:01:37,560 --> 00:01:43,049
many names but you may call me well I'd

47
00:01:41,250 --> 00:01:45,840
like to call them lots of things he's

48
00:01:43,049 --> 00:01:47,310
not in the enchanter but attack where

49
00:01:45,840 --> 00:01:49,439
applications is what I kind of decided

50
00:01:47,310 --> 00:01:50,909
to call the talk I thought that's quite

51
00:01:49,439 --> 00:01:55,648
generic and that kind of worked quite

52
00:01:50,909 --> 00:01:57,030
well clearly a lot of different

53
00:01:55,649 --> 00:01:58,259
descriptions of things I came up with

54
00:01:57,030 --> 00:01:59,490
the top one but I realized that it

55
00:01:58,259 --> 00:02:01,649
doesn't have a very good business

56
00:01:59,490 --> 00:02:05,100
appropriate acronym I'll let you figure

57
00:02:01,649 --> 00:02:06,990
that out feel free to laugh but

58
00:02:05,100 --> 00:02:09,299
basically I think you might be starting

59
00:02:06,990 --> 00:02:12,480
to get the idea about what this might be

60
00:02:09,300 --> 00:02:13,500
but I would describe it a little bit

61
00:02:12,480 --> 00:02:17,250
more as

62
00:02:13,500 --> 00:02:19,590
as this an application that can detect

63
00:02:17,250 --> 00:02:24,000
malicious behavior whatever that might

64
00:02:19,590 --> 00:02:28,050
be and respond to it in some way and

65
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:29,520
lets us work through this with you know

66
00:02:28,050 --> 00:02:33,240
let's work through this and see how it

67
00:02:29,520 --> 00:02:35,760
works out if you've got a chance as an

68
00:02:33,240 --> 00:02:37,860
application designer to be able to spot

69
00:02:35,760 --> 00:02:40,380
your attacker having a bit of a kind of

70
00:02:37,860 --> 00:02:43,080
a go at your application before they've

71
00:02:40,380 --> 00:02:45,780
managed to actively develop or an

72
00:02:43,080 --> 00:02:46,800
exploit a vulnerability then maybe you

73
00:02:45,780 --> 00:02:50,970
get a chance to do something interesting

74
00:02:46,800 --> 00:02:52,290
with them play with their minds so this

75
00:02:50,970 --> 00:02:55,950
isn't saying this is a complete

76
00:02:52,290 --> 00:02:58,109
replacement for a secure development

77
00:02:55,950 --> 00:03:00,959
lifecycle or any the deficit cups models

78
00:02:58,110 --> 00:03:02,610
I'll say layered on top I'm also not

79
00:03:00,959 --> 00:03:03,900
claiming to assault security clearly I

80
00:03:02,610 --> 00:03:07,770
have but I'm not claiming to a social

81
00:03:03,900 --> 00:03:10,860
security joke but let's see why the

82
00:03:07,770 --> 00:03:16,020
application what does the application

83
00:03:10,860 --> 00:03:21,330
know so actually I think your

84
00:03:16,020 --> 00:03:24,120
application knows quite a lot you've

85
00:03:21,330 --> 00:03:25,800
probably got a big team maybe you're

86
00:03:24,120 --> 00:03:27,420
part of those that team big team of

87
00:03:25,800 --> 00:03:29,550
people who've been thinking about what

88
00:03:27,420 --> 00:03:33,119
your application does they put in a lot

89
00:03:29,550 --> 00:03:35,370
of hard work in to do with it they have

90
00:03:33,120 --> 00:03:37,080
spent a long time thinking about how a

91
00:03:35,370 --> 00:03:39,450
user is going to interact with it and

92
00:03:37,080 --> 00:03:42,239
thus they end up with a lot of knowledge

93
00:03:39,450 --> 00:03:45,179
about what normal looks like and what

94
00:03:42,239 --> 00:03:48,150
normal doesn't look like so that

95
00:03:45,180 --> 00:03:49,739
basically adds up to to context because

96
00:03:48,150 --> 00:03:52,350
also your application has got a lot of

97
00:03:49,739 --> 00:03:54,120
information that may not be anywhere

98
00:03:52,350 --> 00:03:56,970
else in your organization at any one

99
00:03:54,120 --> 00:04:00,810
time so that's why the application is

100
00:03:56,970 --> 00:04:03,120
quite interesting and quiet and feels

101
00:04:00,810 --> 00:04:04,709
like quite appropriate at this point so

102
00:04:03,120 --> 00:04:07,019
I'm gonna walk through some examples to

103
00:04:04,709 --> 00:04:09,930
try and communicate the sorts of things

104
00:04:07,019 --> 00:04:12,750
that I want to move on to and I'll start

105
00:04:09,930 --> 00:04:15,420
with credential stuffing I'll explain

106
00:04:12,750 --> 00:04:17,790
what it is I'm just going to say that

107
00:04:15,420 --> 00:04:19,709
this is intended to illustrate a point I

108
00:04:17,790 --> 00:04:21,390
am sure that some of you know a lot more

109
00:04:19,709 --> 00:04:22,680
about credential stuffing than I do

110
00:04:21,390 --> 00:04:24,419
I thought asked me not a good example

111
00:04:22,680 --> 00:04:26,190
for I can explain some points here and I

112
00:04:24,419 --> 00:04:27,389
started looking at it and it it's a

113
00:04:26,190 --> 00:04:29,400
rabbit hole and it goes quite

114
00:04:27,389 --> 00:04:30,749
it comes out in Australia somewhere so

115
00:04:29,400 --> 00:04:32,188
we're not quite going to Australia but

116
00:04:30,749 --> 00:04:36,389
I'm going to start taking this down a

117
00:04:32,189 --> 00:04:39,240
little bit so credential stuffing so as

118
00:04:36,389 --> 00:04:41,370
a slide from Troy Hunt ofsome allegedly

119
00:04:39,240 --> 00:04:44,069
some live credentials that have been

120
00:04:41,370 --> 00:04:46,259
stolen from some breach elsewhere in the

121
00:04:44,069 --> 00:04:47,639
world not your organization they're out

122
00:04:46,259 --> 00:04:49,650
there and this is a set of you know live

123
00:04:47,639 --> 00:04:50,939
credentials username or email addresses

124
00:04:49,650 --> 00:04:53,279
and passwords in this particular case

125
00:04:50,939 --> 00:04:56,430
what happens when this when this occurs

126
00:04:53,279 --> 00:04:58,319
in the real world basically criminals

127
00:04:56,430 --> 00:04:59,550
bad actors will get their hands on this

128
00:04:58,319 --> 00:05:01,620
information and they're just going to

129
00:04:59,550 --> 00:05:03,840
start flinging this stuff up pretty much

130
00:05:01,620 --> 00:05:06,919
every web service that is out there in

131
00:05:03,840 --> 00:05:09,989
the world that uses email address and

132
00:05:06,919 --> 00:05:11,909
password there to see if anybody has

133
00:05:09,990 --> 00:05:14,610
been foolish enough to reuse the same

134
00:05:11,909 --> 00:05:16,438
password so if you have any service that

135
00:05:14,610 --> 00:05:18,210
you offer there which you know it might

136
00:05:16,439 --> 00:05:19,620
be you might be a web banking service it

137
00:05:18,210 --> 00:05:21,180
might be some kind of loyalty card

138
00:05:19,620 --> 00:05:22,469
system it might be retail it could be

139
00:05:21,180 --> 00:05:23,789
anything if you've got something out

140
00:05:22,469 --> 00:05:26,909
there you'll likely get a lot of attacks

141
00:05:23,789 --> 00:05:28,949
like this and that's was it ten examples

142
00:05:26,909 --> 00:05:31,050
but yeah in reality the list is going to

143
00:05:28,949 --> 00:05:33,089
be hundreds of thousands depending on

144
00:05:31,050 --> 00:05:34,439
where it's been breached from in the

145
00:05:33,089 --> 00:05:36,509
criminal ecosystem what tends to happen

146
00:05:34,439 --> 00:05:37,919
is obviously that you know they get big

147
00:05:36,509 --> 00:05:39,599
lists like this but actually any of

148
00:05:37,919 --> 00:05:41,520
those credentials that then happen to

149
00:05:39,599 --> 00:05:43,229
map to another another service that you

150
00:05:41,520 --> 00:05:45,479
can log into they become more valuable

151
00:05:43,229 --> 00:05:46,979
and it get kind of sold on but we're not

152
00:05:45,479 --> 00:05:48,240
here to talk about criminal ecosystem

153
00:05:46,979 --> 00:05:51,779
I'm here to talk about attack aware

154
00:05:48,240 --> 00:05:53,159
applications so what are we seeing here

155
00:05:51,779 --> 00:05:55,050
you're seeing your login page being

156
00:05:53,159 --> 00:05:57,449
assailed by absolute volume lots and

157
00:05:55,050 --> 00:05:59,699
lots of these attempts and maybe even

158
00:05:57,449 --> 00:06:01,979
coming from a single connection a single

159
00:05:59,699 --> 00:06:03,629
session pushing these things yeah I know

160
00:06:01,979 --> 00:06:05,490
that's that might be an assumption that

161
00:06:03,629 --> 00:06:08,250
may be incorrect but we'll I think what

162
00:06:05,490 --> 00:06:09,979
about for a minute what you do well this

163
00:06:08,250 --> 00:06:12,870
is a naive approach what do you do well

164
00:06:09,979 --> 00:06:14,878
hello i'm an application i'm reporting

165
00:06:12,870 --> 00:06:17,520
that i have been subjected to credential

166
00:06:14,879 --> 00:06:19,409
stuffing from some IP address or some

167
00:06:17,520 --> 00:06:20,938
session some detail and you're pushing

168
00:06:19,409 --> 00:06:25,379
that up to your to your monitoring

169
00:06:20,939 --> 00:06:26,639
service just sock and or other over the

170
00:06:25,379 --> 00:06:28,800
place where this stuff gets registered

171
00:06:26,639 --> 00:06:29,789
at this point you say okay well what

172
00:06:28,800 --> 00:06:31,409
have you got here we've got an

173
00:06:29,789 --> 00:06:32,969
application is actually telling you what

174
00:06:31,409 --> 00:06:35,639
is happening rather than you're just

175
00:06:32,969 --> 00:06:36,629
seeing an awful at the the sake and

176
00:06:35,639 --> 00:06:38,250
you're just seeing you know trying to

177
00:06:36,629 --> 00:06:39,460
trigger a use case saying how many

178
00:06:38,250 --> 00:06:41,530
password

179
00:06:39,460 --> 00:06:42,760
rejection accounts mercy am i seeing a

180
00:06:41,530 --> 00:06:44,440
bit of a spiking that am i seeing a

181
00:06:42,760 --> 00:06:45,820
traffic spike no what you're actually

182
00:06:44,440 --> 00:06:48,280
seeing here is you're getting a

183
00:06:45,820 --> 00:06:51,280
hopefully a reasonably clear message

184
00:06:48,280 --> 00:06:53,440
saying I am this application which might

185
00:06:51,280 --> 00:06:55,119
be one of a lot one of you know hundred

186
00:06:53,440 --> 00:06:56,620
applications if you have your large bank

187
00:06:55,120 --> 00:06:58,480
or something like that one application

188
00:06:56,620 --> 00:07:00,040
is telling you what is happening which

189
00:06:58,480 --> 00:07:01,720
says that that information is probably

190
00:07:00,040 --> 00:07:04,510
more valuable to your socrata response

191
00:07:01,720 --> 00:07:05,890
services then you might otherwise get

192
00:07:04,510 --> 00:07:09,760
you don't have the application is a

193
00:07:05,890 --> 00:07:11,800
little bit of thinking for it so that's

194
00:07:09,760 --> 00:07:14,830
a start but that's not necessarily about

195
00:07:11,800 --> 00:07:16,030
as good as it could get what about the

196
00:07:14,830 --> 00:07:18,640
application has done something about it

197
00:07:16,030 --> 00:07:20,380
the application said ah I'm being

198
00:07:18,640 --> 00:07:22,270
assailed by this volume I've now told

199
00:07:20,380 --> 00:07:24,100
the attacker that very sorry but the

200
00:07:22,270 --> 00:07:26,710
service happens to be unavailable for

201
00:07:24,100 --> 00:07:28,060
maintenance or whatever reasons or I

202
00:07:26,710 --> 00:07:29,260
don't like you it could be whatever it

203
00:07:28,060 --> 00:07:31,240
is but actually the application has

204
00:07:29,260 --> 00:07:33,250
taken has taken a stance and is is

205
00:07:31,240 --> 00:07:35,890
trying to do something actively about

206
00:07:33,250 --> 00:07:37,480
that may not be the most appropriate

207
00:07:35,890 --> 00:07:39,430
action because actually your attack is

208
00:07:37,480 --> 00:07:40,720
likely to come back but as I say I don't

209
00:07:39,430 --> 00:07:42,940
want to disappear too far down the

210
00:07:40,720 --> 00:07:44,800
credential stuffing rabbit hole because

211
00:07:42,940 --> 00:07:47,469
it's quite an interesting conversation

212
00:07:44,800 --> 00:07:50,700
and I don't have three hours because I'm

213
00:07:47,470 --> 00:07:54,490
between you and lunch so what next

214
00:07:50,700 --> 00:07:57,099
well what about this then so so now is

215
00:07:54,490 --> 00:08:00,550
saying the application spotted that this

216
00:07:57,100 --> 00:08:02,110
is going on it's told the socks they can

217
00:08:00,550 --> 00:08:03,850
start try the monster response or do

218
00:08:02,110 --> 00:08:06,730
something but it has proactively said

219
00:08:03,850 --> 00:08:08,980
hey other Network device can you just

220
00:08:06,730 --> 00:08:11,350
make the IP address go away just you

221
00:08:08,980 --> 00:08:12,820
know go and drop the traffic or throttle

222
00:08:11,350 --> 00:08:14,050
it stick it in the tar pit do whatever

223
00:08:12,820 --> 00:08:16,090
you need to do to it but actually it's

224
00:08:14,050 --> 00:08:18,180
now it's now respondent it's asked a

225
00:08:16,090 --> 00:08:21,039
different device in your environment

226
00:08:18,180 --> 00:08:22,810
which may or may not be appropriate in

227
00:08:21,040 --> 00:08:24,010
order to do something with it and it's

228
00:08:22,810 --> 00:08:25,480
told the sock and something I got asked

229
00:08:24,010 --> 00:08:26,680
great but we don't need you anything

230
00:08:25,480 --> 00:08:28,720
because the application has already kind

231
00:08:26,680 --> 00:08:31,750
of handled some of this okay

232
00:08:28,720 --> 00:08:33,190
that's kind of cool so I quite like that

233
00:08:31,750 --> 00:08:35,950
as an idea whether or not that would

234
00:08:33,190 --> 00:08:37,720
work in practice I don't know but it's

235
00:08:35,950 --> 00:08:41,890
still quite naive so what else can we do

236
00:08:37,720 --> 00:08:42,640
about it so okay let's take some let's

237
00:08:41,890 --> 00:08:43,870
take something else maybe the

238
00:08:42,640 --> 00:08:45,460
application wants to change its behavior

239
00:08:43,870 --> 00:08:47,590
in a slightly more sophisticated way

240
00:08:45,460 --> 00:08:51,040
maybe it's now saying something along

241
00:08:47,590 --> 00:08:52,150
the lines of okay I'm getting this

242
00:08:51,040 --> 00:08:53,180
credential stuffing attack kind of

243
00:08:52,150 --> 00:08:55,540
coming in

244
00:08:53,180 --> 00:08:57,589
and what I'm actually going to do is

245
00:08:55,540 --> 00:08:59,599
anybody that's trying to log in through

246
00:08:57,590 --> 00:09:01,220
this and happens to have a correct set

247
00:08:59,600 --> 00:09:02,860
of credentials because you've spotted

248
00:09:01,220 --> 00:09:05,750
it's a credential stuffing attack and

249
00:09:02,860 --> 00:09:08,090
one of these credentials he's actually

250
00:09:05,750 --> 00:09:09,980
right but you know it's a good actual

251
00:09:08,090 --> 00:09:11,270
stuffing attack so it's an attacker we

252
00:09:09,980 --> 00:09:14,630
don't want to let that attacker login

253
00:09:11,270 --> 00:09:17,120
with you know mrs. Smith's credentials

254
00:09:14,630 --> 00:09:18,800
do we actually want to say no don't do

255
00:09:17,120 --> 00:09:21,230
that so maybe we want to do that by

256
00:09:18,800 --> 00:09:23,000
doing something such as a force and

257
00:09:21,230 --> 00:09:24,230
additional challenge on there or

258
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:26,480
something like that maybe that's what we

259
00:09:24,230 --> 00:09:28,390
want to do so

260
00:09:26,480 --> 00:09:30,410
push your two-factor challenge perhaps

261
00:09:28,390 --> 00:09:34,240
but there's a slightly more

262
00:09:30,410 --> 00:09:36,500
sophisticated idea which might be

263
00:09:34,240 --> 00:09:39,140
actually why don't we why don't we

264
00:09:36,500 --> 00:09:43,130
identify which of these credentials the

265
00:09:39,140 --> 00:09:44,360
attacker thinks are successful and what

266
00:09:43,130 --> 00:09:45,439
we know that they're successful because

267
00:09:44,360 --> 00:09:47,780
we actually have the list of credentials

268
00:09:45,440 --> 00:09:49,700
on our side but we are going to act we

269
00:09:47,780 --> 00:09:52,730
are going to proactively push all of

270
00:09:49,700 --> 00:09:54,080
those users that unfortunately have

271
00:09:52,730 --> 00:09:54,800
shared their passwords and the attackers

272
00:09:54,080 --> 00:09:56,630
gain godhunt

273
00:09:54,800 --> 00:09:58,729
got hold of them because we know that

274
00:09:56,630 --> 00:10:00,140
the attacker is we know it's the

275
00:09:58,730 --> 00:10:02,150
attacker we're going to push them

276
00:10:00,140 --> 00:10:04,910
through a password reset journey through

277
00:10:02,150 --> 00:10:07,490
a call center or other mechanism as

278
00:10:04,910 --> 00:10:08,870
appropriate and hopefully that's

279
00:10:07,490 --> 00:10:10,490
starting to do something very active

280
00:10:08,870 --> 00:10:12,500
there which is defending your user base

281
00:10:10,490 --> 00:10:15,590
even when they've basically done

282
00:10:12,500 --> 00:10:18,590
something a little bit silly so that's

283
00:10:15,590 --> 00:10:19,700
kind of cool the application I would say

284
00:10:18,590 --> 00:10:20,930
is probably the only thing that can

285
00:10:19,700 --> 00:10:23,000
realistically do it because it's the

286
00:10:20,930 --> 00:10:24,560
only thing that's got access to that set

287
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:26,720
of credentials and the knowledge there I

288
00:10:24,560 --> 00:10:28,310
don't think you could do this if you use

289
00:10:26,720 --> 00:10:30,620
another technology where application

290
00:10:28,310 --> 00:10:32,329
firewall or or even the sock wouldn't

291
00:10:30,620 --> 00:10:33,680
have visibility of this information

292
00:10:32,330 --> 00:10:37,010
that's probably going to see for the

293
00:10:33,680 --> 00:10:39,800
most part 200 and 500 and 400 fours and

294
00:10:37,010 --> 00:10:40,330
that sort of stuff so probably not going

295
00:10:39,800 --> 00:10:43,819
to happen

296
00:10:40,330 --> 00:10:45,620
could a rasp do it we'll talk about

297
00:10:43,820 --> 00:10:49,310
rasps a little bit in a while but I

298
00:10:45,620 --> 00:10:51,110
would also like your not so okay so

299
00:10:49,310 --> 00:10:53,510
that's that's one sort of example of

300
00:10:51,110 --> 00:10:55,310
this and actually this stuff happens a

301
00:10:53,510 --> 00:10:56,840
little bit in practice anyway but let's

302
00:10:55,310 --> 00:11:02,689
let's move on to another different

303
00:10:56,840 --> 00:11:04,930
example so thinking of a probably now an

304
00:11:02,690 --> 00:11:08,860
internal application

305
00:11:04,930 --> 00:11:12,829
because it makes a little bit more sense

306
00:11:08,860 --> 00:11:15,370
think about the whole idea of honey

307
00:11:12,830 --> 00:11:19,100
values honey pots and tokens and

308
00:11:15,370 --> 00:11:22,100
Canaries too terminology where do we

309
00:11:19,100 --> 00:11:24,050
want to go with this and think about

310
00:11:22,100 --> 00:11:26,000
something that should not be shouldn't

311
00:11:24,050 --> 00:11:28,040
be touched or modify because you

312
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:29,450
basically you know you've set a tripwire

313
00:11:28,040 --> 00:11:31,459
up if anything goes over that why

314
00:11:29,450 --> 00:11:33,890
it's a burglar or if anything you know

315
00:11:31,460 --> 00:11:35,810
if anybody kind of like touches the

316
00:11:33,890 --> 00:11:38,360
priceless portrait on the wall of the

317
00:11:35,810 --> 00:11:40,099
other Louvre then that's somebody trying

318
00:11:38,360 --> 00:11:42,140
to steal it Sasa set off the alarms

319
00:11:40,100 --> 00:11:43,880
you've made something that's really

320
00:11:42,140 --> 00:11:45,920
interesting and very tempting for an

321
00:11:43,880 --> 00:11:47,660
attacker something that they can't

322
00:11:45,920 --> 00:11:49,520
resist what you've actually asked them

323
00:11:47,660 --> 00:11:52,400
what you've actually happened Oh Kurt

324
00:11:49,520 --> 00:11:53,750
caused to occur there is the attacker is

325
00:11:52,400 --> 00:11:55,640
going to give themselves away to some

326
00:11:53,750 --> 00:11:57,440
degree and normally something that a

327
00:11:55,640 --> 00:12:00,890
normal user is not going to not going to

328
00:11:57,440 --> 00:12:03,890
look at and not touch so the example

329
00:12:00,890 --> 00:12:05,840
there of putting a slash admin page on

330
00:12:03,890 --> 00:12:07,310
your website that latent the officer is

331
00:12:05,840 --> 00:12:08,810
probably too obvious to be honest which

332
00:12:07,310 --> 00:12:10,369
is also why I'd say better as an

333
00:12:08,810 --> 00:12:12,020
internal thing but maybe if you have a

334
00:12:10,370 --> 00:12:14,480
user ID or something like that maybe and

335
00:12:12,020 --> 00:12:15,920
maybe is actually the user ID of the

336
00:12:14,480 --> 00:12:18,610
user that is interacting with the site

337
00:12:15,920 --> 00:12:21,260
that's fine why would you as a usual

338
00:12:18,610 --> 00:12:24,620
ordinary everyday user ever been

339
00:12:21,260 --> 00:12:27,650
modifying your own user ID by probably

340
00:12:24,620 --> 00:12:28,430
using a proxy and all the rest of it you

341
00:12:27,650 --> 00:12:31,310
wouldn't do that

342
00:12:28,430 --> 00:12:33,020
you know the session as the application

343
00:12:31,310 --> 00:12:36,079
you know that this has changed you are

344
00:12:33,020 --> 00:12:38,930
pretty darn sure at this point that that

345
00:12:36,080 --> 00:12:42,410
is an attacker so straight away that is

346
00:12:38,930 --> 00:12:44,449
a very high fidelity alert and that is

347
00:12:42,410 --> 00:12:49,390
something that you can actively go and

348
00:12:44,450 --> 00:12:52,100
take some go and do some response on so

349
00:12:49,390 --> 00:12:53,750
what do you do well I think you could

350
00:12:52,100 --> 00:12:55,310
take you could turn your sock I would

351
00:12:53,750 --> 00:12:56,840
advocate doing this all the time so you

352
00:12:55,310 --> 00:12:59,510
got to send a central place whereby you

353
00:12:56,840 --> 00:13:02,330
can actually collect this information

354
00:12:59,510 --> 00:13:03,380
and kickoff responses you could start

355
00:13:02,330 --> 00:13:05,150
doing some things that are saying

356
00:13:03,380 --> 00:13:06,950
alright I've thought this is definitely

357
00:13:05,150 --> 00:13:07,910
attacker right not interested in there

358
00:13:06,950 --> 00:13:11,690
I'm not gonna talk to them will drop

359
00:13:07,910 --> 00:13:13,040
their traffic make they go away here's a

360
00:13:11,690 --> 00:13:15,500
bit more interesting what if you were

361
00:13:13,040 --> 00:13:17,819
instead to say okay that's an attacker

362
00:13:15,500 --> 00:13:20,970
I'm going to use

363
00:13:17,820 --> 00:13:22,950
network routing say we're not talking

364
00:13:20,970 --> 00:13:25,680
you know this attacker here was talking

365
00:13:22,950 --> 00:13:29,040
to my web to my site web application a

366
00:13:25,680 --> 00:13:31,589
moment ago right now because I know it's

367
00:13:29,040 --> 00:13:33,780
an attacker is going to quietly redirect

368
00:13:31,590 --> 00:13:35,940
their session their IP address their

369
00:13:33,780 --> 00:13:37,410
connection in whatever way somewhere

370
00:13:35,940 --> 00:13:39,950
else what about to a completely static

371
00:13:37,410 --> 00:13:42,600
copy of my site they can't do any damage

372
00:13:39,950 --> 00:13:44,970
you know take the while spotter around

373
00:13:42,600 --> 00:13:46,560
that there's no live data to steal they

374
00:13:44,970 --> 00:13:49,590
make ultimately get a bit confused and

375
00:13:46,560 --> 00:13:51,270
wander off one might hope you could

376
00:13:49,590 --> 00:13:52,590
instead say actually we'll take that

377
00:13:51,270 --> 00:13:56,100
idea a bit further what do we have a

378
00:13:52,590 --> 00:13:57,870
copy of our website in an identical

379
00:13:56,100 --> 00:13:59,220
environment because it's kind of easy in

380
00:13:57,870 --> 00:14:01,080
cloud environments nowadays isn't it's

381
00:13:59,220 --> 00:14:02,700
been a but a separate copy of it well we

382
00:14:01,080 --> 00:14:05,640
don't put any production data in it same

383
00:14:02,700 --> 00:14:07,410
code but now you've only got an attacker

384
00:14:05,640 --> 00:14:10,110
in here and if you instrument this thing

385
00:14:07,410 --> 00:14:13,020
let's watch this attacker now trying to

386
00:14:10,110 --> 00:14:15,390
poke around on your website and break

387
00:14:13,020 --> 00:14:17,010
into it well isn't that an interesting

388
00:14:15,390 --> 00:14:18,480
useful information to say what we'd

389
00:14:17,010 --> 00:14:19,980
figured out how somebody does this in

390
00:14:18,480 --> 00:14:21,000
exactly the same way that you you know

391
00:14:19,980 --> 00:14:23,970
you kind of get this sort of value out

392
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:26,220
of a bug bounty perhaps maybe in some

393
00:14:23,970 --> 00:14:28,800
sort of pen testing some pen testing

394
00:14:26,220 --> 00:14:30,240
thing so you could also do something

395
00:14:28,800 --> 00:14:31,740
that's specific to your application

396
00:14:30,240 --> 00:14:33,540
clearly I'm talking about the entire

397
00:14:31,740 --> 00:14:35,310
world of applications here there is

398
00:14:33,540 --> 00:14:36,240
quite a lot of variety it might be

399
00:14:35,310 --> 00:14:37,020
something very specific to your

400
00:14:36,240 --> 00:14:40,740
application

401
00:14:37,020 --> 00:14:42,949
I don't know so lots of ideas let's

402
00:14:40,740 --> 00:14:44,940
leave those fermenting in our brains

403
00:14:42,950 --> 00:14:46,950
let's talk about another way of doing

404
00:14:44,940 --> 00:14:50,550
things I'm going to call it the sum of

405
00:14:46,950 --> 00:14:53,180
small suspicions and again this is kind

406
00:14:50,550 --> 00:14:55,439
of using a bit of a risk based model I

407
00:14:53,180 --> 00:14:56,699
have to say my career I tend to find

408
00:14:55,440 --> 00:14:58,080
that every time I speak to a developer

409
00:14:56,700 --> 00:15:00,180
and I mention the word risk it kind of

410
00:14:58,080 --> 00:15:02,580
get kind of a visceral kind of shudder

411
00:15:00,180 --> 00:15:04,829
and I don't mean anything as scary as

412
00:15:02,580 --> 00:15:06,320
that all I mean by just actually let's

413
00:15:04,830 --> 00:15:08,850
have a bit of a think about this and say

414
00:15:06,320 --> 00:15:10,710
what if it was you're spotting things

415
00:15:08,850 --> 00:15:12,960
but if you if you can identify somebody

416
00:15:10,710 --> 00:15:14,670
using a copy of Kali or likely to be

417
00:15:12,960 --> 00:15:18,630
using a copy of Kali with the right

418
00:15:14,670 --> 00:15:22,170
browser user agents and the right sort

419
00:15:18,630 --> 00:15:24,030
of analyze that it's not it's not even

420
00:15:22,170 --> 00:15:26,040
definitive you you can't guarantee that

421
00:15:24,030 --> 00:15:28,439
there are no legitimate users using you

422
00:15:26,040 --> 00:15:30,510
know kind of a pen testing Linux for

423
00:15:28,440 --> 00:15:31,950
crying out there but it is a bit

424
00:15:30,510 --> 00:15:33,720
suspicious

425
00:15:31,950 --> 00:15:38,040
like wandering into a bank with a

426
00:15:33,720 --> 00:15:40,350
balaclava on it's not necessarily kind

427
00:15:38,040 --> 00:15:42,719
of definitely going to be it's going to

428
00:15:40,350 --> 00:15:44,550
be bad but it seemed moderately likely

429
00:15:42,720 --> 00:15:45,660
well what did you dress it what if you

430
00:15:44,550 --> 00:15:46,949
kind of think about a few other things

431
00:15:45,660 --> 00:15:48,990
that an attack is probably going to do

432
00:15:46,950 --> 00:15:50,310
well in a visit you know look at the

433
00:15:48,990 --> 00:15:51,510
they're going to be scoping out your

434
00:15:50,310 --> 00:15:53,250
website they're gonna be picking out all

435
00:15:51,510 --> 00:15:54,870
the different bits and pieces that go on

436
00:15:53,250 --> 00:15:55,740
in there all what all the pages are

437
00:15:54,870 --> 00:15:57,660
there any interesting bits of

438
00:15:55,740 --> 00:15:59,400
functionality that I can find I've got a

439
00:15:57,660 --> 00:16:00,779
trial the doors effectually know people

440
00:15:59,400 --> 00:16:02,699
to spy during the site in some capacity

441
00:16:00,779 --> 00:16:04,620
you start to spotlight and go somebody's

442
00:16:02,700 --> 00:16:06,390
spider the site might be a very very

443
00:16:04,620 --> 00:16:09,240
curious end-user I mean they're even

444
00:16:06,390 --> 00:16:10,560
reading the T's and C's or actually

445
00:16:09,240 --> 00:16:12,480
that's a bit suspicious but it's not

446
00:16:10,560 --> 00:16:14,729
enough to say that's definite but

447
00:16:12,480 --> 00:16:15,930
starting to pick some of that up maybe

448
00:16:14,730 --> 00:16:18,240
again maybe also saying well actually

449
00:16:15,930 --> 00:16:20,040
what do people do when they visitor you

450
00:16:18,240 --> 00:16:20,970
know web banking site wale they want to

451
00:16:20,040 --> 00:16:22,500
kind of log in there and look at that

452
00:16:20,970 --> 00:16:26,130
balance so when I transfer some money

453
00:16:22,500 --> 00:16:27,600
they want to set up a standing order if

454
00:16:26,130 --> 00:16:29,010
that was banking maybe they do these

455
00:16:27,600 --> 00:16:30,890
things you've probably spent a lot of

456
00:16:29,010 --> 00:16:33,750
time thinking about your user journeys

457
00:16:30,890 --> 00:16:35,490
so actually you have a lot of that

458
00:16:33,750 --> 00:16:36,750
information already and you might start

459
00:16:35,490 --> 00:16:38,070
to say well actually there's not

460
00:16:36,750 --> 00:16:41,279
following you you know I'm not following

461
00:16:38,070 --> 00:16:42,959
these things there are clearly about a

462
00:16:41,279 --> 00:16:44,790
million different things that you can

463
00:16:42,959 --> 00:16:47,130
pick up here and think well that's a bit

464
00:16:44,790 --> 00:16:48,420
unusual I'll pop that into one side and

465
00:16:47,130 --> 00:16:51,540
think that might be something you could

466
00:16:48,420 --> 00:16:55,589
have a bit of a look at so have a bit of

467
00:16:51,540 --> 00:16:56,880
think about that and an observation here

468
00:16:55,589 --> 00:17:00,120
this makes a lot more sense when you

469
00:16:56,880 --> 00:17:01,529
have authenticated users as well because

470
00:17:00,120 --> 00:17:03,420
you start to be able to kind of track

471
00:17:01,529 --> 00:17:05,869
them a little bit better but that's just

472
00:17:03,420 --> 00:17:08,970
the most like an implementation detail

473
00:17:05,869 --> 00:17:11,339
and also thinking about it think about

474
00:17:08,970 --> 00:17:13,290
kind of the reputation of your of the

475
00:17:11,339 --> 00:17:14,550
people kind of visiting the site this

476
00:17:13,290 --> 00:17:15,629
one's a bit suspicious they're a bit

477
00:17:14,550 --> 00:17:16,859
suspicious last week they're a bit

478
00:17:15,630 --> 00:17:18,059
suspicious today as well

479
00:17:16,859 --> 00:17:19,619
they still got kind of that reputation

480
00:17:18,059 --> 00:17:22,920
from last week we're going to continue

481
00:17:19,619 --> 00:17:25,979
kind of thinking about that and thinking

482
00:17:22,920 --> 00:17:31,010
about that kind of profile a bit so a

483
00:17:25,980 --> 00:17:34,580
bit of that why does that take us to so

484
00:17:31,010 --> 00:17:34,580
let's take something else

485
00:17:35,450 --> 00:17:40,230
what if you're looking at a slight level

486
00:17:38,970 --> 00:17:41,640
rather than looking at kind of traffic

487
00:17:40,230 --> 00:17:42,780
and the way the things you use let's

488
00:17:41,640 --> 00:17:46,740
look at some of your internal

489
00:17:42,780 --> 00:17:50,550
functionality here so assume this very

490
00:17:46,740 --> 00:17:52,560
naive web banking application very

491
00:17:50,550 --> 00:17:53,940
simple functionality you want to think

492
00:17:52,560 --> 00:17:55,440
about which might be you know viewing

493
00:17:53,940 --> 00:17:59,460
your account and transferring money to

494
00:17:55,440 --> 00:18:01,170
somebody else let's take a really

495
00:17:59,460 --> 00:18:04,170
simplistic example you're logged in as

496
00:18:01,170 --> 00:18:06,000
Alice it's strange having an audience

497
00:18:04,170 --> 00:18:09,300
that's all the thing we called our list

498
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:11,190
but you're all logged in as Alice and an

499
00:18:09,300 --> 00:18:13,290
internal function is called which says I

500
00:18:11,190 --> 00:18:16,740
want to transfer money from an account

501
00:18:13,290 --> 00:18:18,030
to another account now internal function

502
00:18:16,740 --> 00:18:20,640
is called saying I want to transfer

503
00:18:18,030 --> 00:18:24,560
money from Bob's account to Mallory's

504
00:18:20,640 --> 00:18:27,000
account hang on a sec neither of these

505
00:18:24,560 --> 00:18:30,210
people are Alice that seems very very

506
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:31,800
weird you know it should be you should

507
00:18:30,210 --> 00:18:36,030
be logged as Bob to transfer money from

508
00:18:31,800 --> 00:18:37,590
Bob's account one might hope I mean that

509
00:18:36,030 --> 00:18:38,879
seems a bit curious in its own right you

510
00:18:37,590 --> 00:18:41,100
don't necessarily know how that's

511
00:18:38,880 --> 00:18:43,260
happened but straightaway your internal

512
00:18:41,100 --> 00:18:47,310
sanity check is going whoa that's a bit

513
00:18:43,260 --> 00:18:49,950
curious so straight away that's behavior

514
00:18:47,310 --> 00:18:52,530
that's quite interesting this brings me

515
00:18:49,950 --> 00:18:54,900
on to a little bit of Stu how would you

516
00:18:52,530 --> 00:18:57,300
how would you write that I mean this is

517
00:18:54,900 --> 00:18:58,950
pseudocode but just basically to say

518
00:18:57,300 --> 00:19:02,580
exactly that sort of thing you know

519
00:18:58,950 --> 00:19:06,090
these sorts of actions and behaviors are

520
00:19:02,580 --> 00:19:08,159
written as code you know if it's a if it

521
00:19:06,090 --> 00:19:09,889
doesn't seem to make any sense like that

522
00:19:08,160 --> 00:19:12,750
alert and do something about it

523
00:19:09,890 --> 00:19:14,520
otherwise do the normal thing transfer

524
00:19:12,750 --> 00:19:16,920
the funds which is fine yeah logged in

525
00:19:14,520 --> 00:19:19,590
as Alice here he looked in his Bob or

526
00:19:16,920 --> 00:19:22,860
somebody else there that's all what it

527
00:19:19,590 --> 00:19:24,959
is and actually in terms of writing

528
00:19:22,860 --> 00:19:26,550
applications a lot of it is this is the

529
00:19:24,960 --> 00:19:28,140
normal case we said oh you test for

530
00:19:26,550 --> 00:19:30,510
things but actually if there's a case

531
00:19:28,140 --> 00:19:37,070
that doesn't seem to make adder up let's

532
00:19:30,510 --> 00:19:40,140
let's like that in some way anyway so

533
00:19:37,070 --> 00:19:42,950
this is a simplistic example absolutely

534
00:19:40,140 --> 00:19:44,700
you may also find that this kind of

535
00:19:42,950 --> 00:19:48,300
starting to get it's kind of thinking

536
00:19:44,700 --> 00:19:49,620
will also flog flog flag logic bugs

537
00:19:48,300 --> 00:19:51,300
well you may find that there are sort of

538
00:19:49,620 --> 00:19:52,620
false alerts from those sorts of things

539
00:19:51,300 --> 00:19:54,060
that's fine but actually wouldn't you

540
00:19:52,620 --> 00:19:59,040
rather sort of spot some of this

541
00:19:54,060 --> 00:20:00,980
beforehand so let's start talking about

542
00:19:59,040 --> 00:20:03,930
where this where this came from because

543
00:20:00,980 --> 00:20:08,190
well I think all good stories need an

544
00:20:03,930 --> 00:20:09,690
origin story so back in around 2010 this

545
00:20:08,190 --> 00:20:12,440
gentleman here was bitten by a

546
00:20:09,690 --> 00:20:16,020
radioactive spider in a laboratory

547
00:20:12,440 --> 00:20:19,710
he wasn't that's a bit Marvel isn't it

548
00:20:16,020 --> 00:20:21,090
so there's a chuckle michael coats a lot

549
00:20:19,710 --> 00:20:22,650
of other people are involved in this but

550
00:20:21,090 --> 00:20:24,120
i think of all the themes that i could

551
00:20:22,650 --> 00:20:27,030
commit his name just keeps on cropping

552
00:20:24,120 --> 00:20:29,459
up he's obviously had quite a career

553
00:20:27,030 --> 00:20:31,020
there up to security assurances mozilla

554
00:20:29,460 --> 00:20:34,800
means CC of twitter until fairly

555
00:20:31,020 --> 00:20:36,810
recently he's also being global head of

556
00:20:34,800 --> 00:20:38,930
the OWASP board or know somebody pretty

557
00:20:36,810 --> 00:20:42,870
seen you in the OWASP organization and

558
00:20:38,930 --> 00:20:44,880
he created a no wast project called app

559
00:20:42,870 --> 00:20:47,879
sensor and i would suggest that's a bit

560
00:20:44,880 --> 00:20:48,960
of a bit of a passion project for him he

561
00:20:47,880 --> 00:20:50,250
kind of like he thought and actually

562
00:20:48,960 --> 00:20:52,020
that's where a lot of these ideas came

563
00:20:50,250 --> 00:20:57,710
from and that's where I picked up this

564
00:20:52,020 --> 00:20:59,970
idea now I don't want to belittle

565
00:20:57,710 --> 00:21:01,620
everybody else's contribution in this

566
00:20:59,970 --> 00:21:05,760
field as well I just his name keeps on

567
00:21:01,620 --> 00:21:09,030
keeps him cropping up but I am aware of

568
00:21:05,760 --> 00:21:10,379
things such as whilst he was at Mozilla

569
00:21:09,030 --> 00:21:11,760
apparently they integrated some of these

570
00:21:10,380 --> 00:21:14,820
ideas into some of their internal

571
00:21:11,760 --> 00:21:17,400
applications which is kind of cool so it

572
00:21:14,820 --> 00:21:20,879
is happening around there been some

573
00:21:17,400 --> 00:21:22,800
academic papers as well although they

574
00:21:20,880 --> 00:21:24,720
are as I can omit papers are quite dry

575
00:21:22,800 --> 00:21:27,110
and quite hard to consume and often to

576
00:21:24,720 --> 00:21:31,020
condemned to a life of academic papers

577
00:21:27,110 --> 00:21:33,959
but moving on let's take a bit of a look

578
00:21:31,020 --> 00:21:38,210
at adapt sensor which is the project

579
00:21:33,960 --> 00:21:42,660
that I formed so easy to find on the net

580
00:21:38,210 --> 00:21:44,130
what's distinctive about this well it

581
00:21:42,660 --> 00:21:45,660
has what I'll call a reference

582
00:21:44,130 --> 00:21:47,280
implementation you might call it proof

583
00:21:45,660 --> 00:21:49,620
of concepts I would argue that it's

584
00:21:47,280 --> 00:21:53,970
probably not production code your

585
00:21:49,620 --> 00:21:56,550
mileage may vary it takes the idea a

586
00:21:53,970 --> 00:21:59,070
little bit a little bit more seriously

587
00:21:56,550 --> 00:22:00,940
it's and it looks and it kind of pulls

588
00:21:59,070 --> 00:22:02,590
things apart a little bit

589
00:22:00,940 --> 00:22:04,510
it has a set what's called the central

590
00:22:02,590 --> 00:22:07,270
analysis engine that deals with deals

591
00:22:04,510 --> 00:22:10,140
with policy and let's just take a bit of

592
00:22:07,270 --> 00:22:13,330
a look to see how how that might work so

593
00:22:10,140 --> 00:22:16,090
really simply okay your attacker

594
00:22:13,330 --> 00:22:17,710
and your user looking at your suite of

595
00:22:16,090 --> 00:22:19,120
web applications in this case there are

596
00:22:17,710 --> 00:22:21,370
three of them there may be a thousand

597
00:22:19,120 --> 00:22:22,750
and your web applications are doing

598
00:22:21,370 --> 00:22:24,129
things such as they're supporting these

599
00:22:22,750 --> 00:22:25,930
user journeys exporting its good

600
00:22:24,130 --> 00:22:27,220
behavior this bad behavior well this

601
00:22:25,930 --> 00:22:28,810
would be bad behavior that using there's

602
00:22:27,220 --> 00:22:30,940
lovely blue arrows there to push it to

603
00:22:28,810 --> 00:22:32,710
this analysis engine of absence or

604
00:22:30,940 --> 00:22:34,600
analysis engine which again is nothing

605
00:22:32,710 --> 00:22:36,460
more complicated than saying it's a set

606
00:22:34,600 --> 00:22:39,459
of rules that sort of say if I get a bit

607
00:22:36,460 --> 00:22:41,200
of that add a bit of that not so sure if

608
00:22:39,460 --> 00:22:43,930
the if the visitor happens to have a

609
00:22:41,200 --> 00:22:46,240
balaclava on and the gun at a ransom on

610
00:22:43,930 --> 00:22:48,460
a threatening kind of hand over all the

611
00:22:46,240 --> 00:22:51,460
cash can a note that's definitely worth

612
00:22:48,460 --> 00:22:53,200
worth thinking about pushes all of this

613
00:22:51,460 --> 00:22:55,210
stuff up to the sock on the right-hand

614
00:22:53,200 --> 00:22:56,860
side you can go off and do good sock

615
00:22:55,210 --> 00:22:58,720
things or hopefully be get woken up at 3

616
00:22:56,860 --> 00:23:02,350
o'clock on a Sunday morning in some

617
00:22:58,720 --> 00:23:03,730
faraway country if you got MSSP but also

618
00:23:02,350 --> 00:23:06,070
the interesting thing is there were

619
00:23:03,730 --> 00:23:10,030
those orange lines kind of coming back

620
00:23:06,070 --> 00:23:14,200
in your applications are getting a bit

621
00:23:10,030 --> 00:23:15,970
of feedback saying this user is bad or

622
00:23:14,200 --> 00:23:17,860
this IP restore this session or this

623
00:23:15,970 --> 00:23:19,300
whatever intelligence you've got and

624
00:23:17,860 --> 00:23:21,429
they can make some reactions and make

625
00:23:19,300 --> 00:23:24,100
some do some dynamic behavior based on

626
00:23:21,430 --> 00:23:25,510
what that is it also means that the

627
00:23:24,100 --> 00:23:26,830
attacker has had a bit of a probe up

628
00:23:25,510 --> 00:23:28,540
here and a bit of probe there and a bit

629
00:23:26,830 --> 00:23:30,580
of a probe here but not really quite

630
00:23:28,540 --> 00:23:32,560
managed to do enough attack on one thing

631
00:23:30,580 --> 00:23:35,560
it means that your application can

632
00:23:32,560 --> 00:23:38,050
already be primed to know that actually

633
00:23:35,560 --> 00:23:40,570
there's a bit of reconnaissance kind of

634
00:23:38,050 --> 00:23:42,190
going on here so there's a lot more

635
00:23:40,570 --> 00:23:43,780
there the model is in practice could be

636
00:23:42,190 --> 00:23:45,370
a lot more complicated you could start

637
00:23:43,780 --> 00:23:48,760
adding firewalls also feeding into your

638
00:23:45,370 --> 00:23:50,530
analysis engine etc and you could

639
00:23:48,760 --> 00:23:53,680
implement your analysis engine use cases

640
00:23:50,530 --> 00:23:57,810
in your sock perhaps many possibilities

641
00:23:53,680 --> 00:24:00,040
but that's how how app sensor did it and

642
00:23:57,810 --> 00:24:02,470
what I would suggest is they've done a

643
00:24:00,040 --> 00:24:06,250
lot of the thinking for you you know

644
00:24:02,470 --> 00:24:08,050
standing on their shoulders and and move

645
00:24:06,250 --> 00:24:09,520
on from there but it does mean though

646
00:24:08,050 --> 00:24:11,830
that all those alerts going up to the

647
00:24:09,520 --> 00:24:13,240
sock a high-fidelity they are worth them

648
00:24:11,830 --> 00:24:14,860
paying attention to they're worth

649
00:24:13,240 --> 00:24:17,980
getting human eyes on

650
00:24:14,860 --> 00:24:20,590
yes that is valid or that is not valid

651
00:24:17,980 --> 00:24:22,660
so that is a very important thing and

652
00:24:20,590 --> 00:24:24,459
that also helps to lower your Sox

653
00:24:22,660 --> 00:24:28,810
workload and allows them to do some very

654
00:24:24,460 --> 00:24:33,370
effective response if they need to do so

655
00:24:28,810 --> 00:24:34,840
so moving on this is what I think is

656
00:24:33,370 --> 00:24:37,000
happening with that sensor it's

657
00:24:34,840 --> 00:24:39,429
tumbleweed for those of us that are not

658
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:40,810
American I don't think a lots happening

659
00:24:39,430 --> 00:24:42,670
with it at the minute which is really

660
00:24:40,810 --> 00:24:44,320
really weird because it's our this idea

661
00:24:42,670 --> 00:24:46,840
it came to me and I thought oh my god

662
00:24:44,320 --> 00:24:48,429
that's really cool and you're stunned

663
00:24:46,840 --> 00:24:49,720
silence I'm just presuming you're also

664
00:24:48,430 --> 00:24:51,760
kind of thinking the same thing of quite

665
00:24:49,720 --> 00:24:53,470
interesting you're quite cool idea not a

666
00:24:51,760 --> 00:24:56,500
lot is going on with it and I'm not

667
00:24:53,470 --> 00:24:58,570
seeing a lot out there so the

668
00:24:56,500 --> 00:25:01,030
application the app sensor application

669
00:24:58,570 --> 00:25:02,889
itself is I don't believe its production

670
00:25:01,030 --> 00:25:04,810
code it fits in with things like isapi

671
00:25:02,890 --> 00:25:07,540
which isn't really going anywhere it's

672
00:25:04,810 --> 00:25:08,649
no loss project so maybe maybe you can't

673
00:25:07,540 --> 00:25:11,560
just kind of pull it off the shelf and

674
00:25:08,650 --> 00:25:16,630
just use it but actually what it does is

675
00:25:11,560 --> 00:25:18,429
not too complicated so why is this is it

676
00:25:16,630 --> 00:25:20,020
a case of you know we're getting the

677
00:25:18,430 --> 00:25:22,840
same kind of functionality from

678
00:25:20,020 --> 00:25:26,710
different devices or technologies on our

679
00:25:22,840 --> 00:25:28,959
networks is that how it is and then

680
00:25:26,710 --> 00:25:31,240
we've got lots of you know Russ for next

681
00:25:28,960 --> 00:25:33,490
gen web application firewalls that are

682
00:25:31,240 --> 00:25:36,190
all claiming to have lots of behavioral

683
00:25:33,490 --> 00:25:37,570
analysis and ml which i think is mostly

684
00:25:36,190 --> 00:25:39,700
stands for marketing language but

685
00:25:37,570 --> 00:25:42,790
there's lots of there's lots of that

686
00:25:39,700 --> 00:25:44,470
kind of going on so what's going on is

687
00:25:42,790 --> 00:25:46,899
it is it cannibalization of that market

688
00:25:44,470 --> 00:25:48,490
is it the fact that you can just go ah

689
00:25:46,900 --> 00:25:50,500
we built our application quick we need

690
00:25:48,490 --> 00:25:52,060
to get it to market and we'll stick a

691
00:25:50,500 --> 00:25:53,380
web application firewall in front of it

692
00:25:52,060 --> 00:25:56,260
which can be quite handy for getting

693
00:25:53,380 --> 00:25:58,150
through PCR tests and there is a

694
00:25:56,260 --> 00:25:59,560
requirement suggesting you do secure

695
00:25:58,150 --> 00:26:01,570
code with your everything or you put a

696
00:25:59,560 --> 00:26:04,240
wife in front of it so a wife in front

697
00:26:01,570 --> 00:26:08,710
with one rule that never fires ticks the

698
00:26:04,240 --> 00:26:10,090
box allegedly so there's that idea you

699
00:26:08,710 --> 00:26:12,990
could do that you can use Russ real time

700
00:26:10,090 --> 00:26:15,129
application security protection a

701
00:26:12,990 --> 00:26:17,110
variety of organizations some of the

702
00:26:15,130 --> 00:26:19,210
vendors downstairs link are are are also

703
00:26:17,110 --> 00:26:20,979
selling these and it's quite good they

704
00:26:19,210 --> 00:26:23,950
instrument the runtime and they kind of

705
00:26:20,980 --> 00:26:26,020
figure out what's normal what's not and

706
00:26:23,950 --> 00:26:28,020
can start can start shouting about it

707
00:26:26,020 --> 00:26:29,370
great technology I'm not trying to rub

708
00:26:28,020 --> 00:26:30,389
the missing actually that said that's a

709
00:26:29,370 --> 00:26:33,199
different sort of thing that can kind of

710
00:26:30,390 --> 00:26:36,090
like and kind of fit in there as well

711
00:26:33,200 --> 00:26:39,020
but you're still looking there at say at

712
00:26:36,090 --> 00:26:41,399
an external product that does not know

713
00:26:39,020 --> 00:26:44,220
much about your organ does not know much

714
00:26:41,400 --> 00:26:45,630
about your application you know you've

715
00:26:44,220 --> 00:26:47,190
got fine you've got these things here

716
00:26:45,630 --> 00:26:48,810
saying well the quick to deploy we know

717
00:26:47,190 --> 00:26:50,340
that just by one that's great

718
00:26:48,810 --> 00:26:52,260
they've known technology we already know

719
00:26:50,340 --> 00:26:55,100
what these things are that's great you

720
00:26:52,260 --> 00:26:57,210
don't necessarily need a fairly mature

721
00:26:55,100 --> 00:26:58,699
lifecycle you developers to be really

722
00:26:57,210 --> 00:27:02,850
aware in order to be able to deploy this

723
00:26:58,700 --> 00:27:07,020
and it may be good enough yeah so maybe

724
00:27:02,850 --> 00:27:08,459
that's why it's coming along compare and

725
00:27:07,020 --> 00:27:10,740
contrast that then with your tack aware

726
00:27:08,460 --> 00:27:13,590
applications I always say you get much

727
00:27:10,740 --> 00:27:16,110
deeper insight into what threats around

728
00:27:13,590 --> 00:27:17,250
your or your application are because

729
00:27:16,110 --> 00:27:20,250
you're thinking about it from the

730
00:27:17,250 --> 00:27:22,200
beginning you're building it in but it's

731
00:27:20,250 --> 00:27:23,520
relatively unknown which is why I'm

732
00:27:22,200 --> 00:27:26,310
talking to you here saying I think this

733
00:27:23,520 --> 00:27:28,620
is a cool idea that's that's a move on

734
00:27:26,310 --> 00:27:30,659
it does take time to implement there is

735
00:27:28,620 --> 00:27:32,300
a cost to that I think it takes less

736
00:27:30,660 --> 00:27:37,140
time than you might think

737
00:27:32,300 --> 00:27:38,580
but let's talk about that but there is

738
00:27:37,140 --> 00:27:39,870
something with all of these kind of

739
00:27:38,580 --> 00:27:41,520
asides there is something I think that

740
00:27:39,870 --> 00:27:45,989
you can do with it today that's really

741
00:27:41,520 --> 00:27:48,650
important and that that is this thing

742
00:27:45,990 --> 00:27:50,010
which is say you can use it as

743
00:27:48,650 --> 00:27:52,320
aspirational

744
00:27:50,010 --> 00:27:55,500
for your development teams if you tell

745
00:27:52,320 --> 00:27:57,540
them that actually you can get one over

746
00:27:55,500 --> 00:28:01,620
on those nasty pen testers that kind of

747
00:27:57,540 --> 00:28:02,909
come along you and you know you get a

748
00:28:01,620 --> 00:28:07,860
chance to be able to go to them and say

749
00:28:02,910 --> 00:28:09,870
look I've created something that you

750
00:28:07,860 --> 00:28:11,189
really can't break into you know doesn't

751
00:28:09,870 --> 00:28:12,419
that kind of say this is putting the

752
00:28:11,190 --> 00:28:13,770
boot on the other foot for a while Rob

753
00:28:12,420 --> 00:28:15,030
and the pen testers coming on so here is

754
00:28:13,770 --> 00:28:16,950
a big long list of stuff that you got

755
00:28:15,030 --> 00:28:19,560
wrong even though you spent ex-man years

756
00:28:16,950 --> 00:28:24,020
making this thing absolutely and that

757
00:28:19,560 --> 00:28:24,020
message some teams works really well the

758
00:28:25,640 --> 00:28:30,900
act of doing it or act of implementing

759
00:28:28,800 --> 00:28:31,980
this really starts to consolidate the

760
00:28:30,900 --> 00:28:35,040
thinking about security

761
00:28:31,980 --> 00:28:36,330
early on I would argue it actually acts

762
00:28:35,040 --> 00:28:40,620
like a kind of a funny fine-grained

763
00:28:36,330 --> 00:28:41,960
threat model because you're having this

764
00:28:40,620 --> 00:28:43,279
kind of security conversation

765
00:28:41,960 --> 00:28:45,110
quite early on you actually putting this

766
00:28:43,279 --> 00:28:48,890
back into your application and that's

767
00:28:45,110 --> 00:28:51,020
quite valuable so you're thinking about

768
00:28:48,890 --> 00:28:53,179
it early on you're building it in that's

769
00:28:51,020 --> 00:28:54,889
great you can bring in other things no

770
00:28:53,179 --> 00:28:58,370
fraud detection there's another kind of

771
00:28:54,890 --> 00:28:59,539
element that's quite similar fraud and

772
00:28:58,370 --> 00:29:00,979
security often sit hand-in-hand

773
00:28:59,539 --> 00:29:03,470
specially for instance financial

774
00:29:00,980 --> 00:29:05,480
institutions but actually bringing that

775
00:29:03,470 --> 00:29:07,490
thinking in say I don't trust this

776
00:29:05,480 --> 00:29:09,409
customer I'm not quite sure about it

777
00:29:07,490 --> 00:29:11,299
like an extra validation if they want to

778
00:29:09,409 --> 00:29:12,039
transfer a million pounds offshore well

779
00:29:11,299 --> 00:29:14,990
absolutely

780
00:29:12,039 --> 00:29:16,279
but being able to do this can really

781
00:29:14,990 --> 00:29:17,860
start to give you that momentum to start

782
00:29:16,279 --> 00:29:22,460
moving things forward

783
00:29:17,860 --> 00:29:24,529
so I'll use then how do you sort of put

784
00:29:22,460 --> 00:29:26,450
this to the to your development team and

785
00:29:24,529 --> 00:29:27,500
say didn't give out those pen testers

786
00:29:26,450 --> 00:29:29,360
that always managed to give you that

787
00:29:27,500 --> 00:29:31,730
great big report yes 22 year old comes

788
00:29:29,360 --> 00:29:32,809
in and looks at the kind of the five man

789
00:29:31,730 --> 00:29:34,490
years worth of what you put in this

790
00:29:32,809 --> 00:29:37,428
thing then you know three days later

791
00:29:34,490 --> 00:29:39,549
they come up with massive report of woe

792
00:29:37,429 --> 00:29:42,230
half of which you don't even understand

793
00:29:39,549 --> 00:29:44,059
it's unfortunately part of the part of

794
00:29:42,230 --> 00:29:45,770
what it is you think actually if you've

795
00:29:44,059 --> 00:29:47,629
got that kind of relationships start to

796
00:29:45,770 --> 00:29:49,220
work with that and say well think about

797
00:29:47,630 --> 00:29:50,990
how can you get one over on those pen

798
00:29:49,220 --> 00:29:52,640
testers play with their minds now think

799
00:29:50,990 --> 00:29:54,289
about all the things that you could do

800
00:29:52,640 --> 00:29:57,649
that would really really make their

801
00:29:54,289 --> 00:29:59,330
lives hard when they're trying to poke

802
00:29:57,649 --> 00:30:01,580
around check which doors are open which

803
00:29:59,330 --> 00:30:03,230
ones are closed no it's closed those

804
00:30:01,580 --> 00:30:04,908
sorts of ideas so though everything is

805
00:30:03,230 --> 00:30:07,190
not quite the same because you have

806
00:30:04,909 --> 00:30:11,360
detected them quietly and you're now

807
00:30:07,190 --> 00:30:13,120
starting to basically use all your other

808
00:30:11,360 --> 00:30:16,100
evil wiles not to do something with it

809
00:30:13,120 --> 00:30:17,389
so it means that they're still looking

810
00:30:16,100 --> 00:30:18,709
you know your patent testers looking at

811
00:30:17,390 --> 00:30:20,390
this as a black box and they're also

812
00:30:18,710 --> 00:30:25,309
finding it much much harder to get to

813
00:30:20,390 --> 00:30:28,250
grips with I work with pen testers and I

814
00:30:25,309 --> 00:30:31,178
know that this is true absolutely true

815
00:30:28,250 --> 00:30:33,860
they get self-doubt after about two days

816
00:30:31,179 --> 00:30:35,120
you want to say a three or four day test

817
00:30:33,860 --> 00:30:36,709
after two days

818
00:30:35,120 --> 00:30:38,389
ah they could ask me in the college I

819
00:30:36,710 --> 00:30:39,890
can't find anything on this report what

820
00:30:38,390 --> 00:30:41,779
do you think it could be and they've

821
00:30:39,890 --> 00:30:43,850
really because they're motivated to find

822
00:30:41,779 --> 00:30:44,929
stuff and actually it's clearly the

823
00:30:43,850 --> 00:30:46,699
wrong thing because actually isn't the

824
00:30:44,929 --> 00:30:48,590
most isn't the happiest thing in the

825
00:30:46,700 --> 00:30:50,029
world to see a pen test report that's

826
00:30:48,590 --> 00:30:51,470
got nerve owner abilities in because the

827
00:30:50,029 --> 00:30:54,200
development team and the organization

828
00:30:51,470 --> 00:30:55,190
have done it right I think that's

829
00:30:54,200 --> 00:30:57,320
awesome

830
00:30:55,190 --> 00:31:00,380
but that's that's gonna where it can it

831
00:30:57,320 --> 00:31:04,610
comes from so I'm gonna start closing

832
00:31:00,380 --> 00:31:06,770
down with a few bits and pieces some

833
00:31:04,610 --> 00:31:08,870
advice that I would give having looked

834
00:31:06,770 --> 00:31:10,580
at this not having implemented it at

835
00:31:08,870 --> 00:31:11,840
scale I have kicked off some projects to

836
00:31:10,580 --> 00:31:14,689
start doing this I don't have any

837
00:31:11,840 --> 00:31:16,490
results to share with you but have a

838
00:31:14,690 --> 00:31:18,530
think about the app sensor detection

839
00:31:16,490 --> 00:31:21,770
points they've already done the thinking

840
00:31:18,530 --> 00:31:24,830
on this it's all open source pull that

841
00:31:21,770 --> 00:31:25,879
down nice and easily and about 50

842
00:31:24,830 --> 00:31:27,500
different things that you can look at

843
00:31:25,880 --> 00:31:28,850
and you can report if you standardize it

844
00:31:27,500 --> 00:31:31,340
and anything comes along in the future

845
00:31:28,850 --> 00:31:33,020
that's where it's likely to go I just

846
00:31:31,340 --> 00:31:34,840
say stand on the shoulders of those guys

847
00:31:33,020 --> 00:31:38,480
they've audio did a lot of good thinking

848
00:31:34,840 --> 00:31:41,149
start there I'm hoping the may be more

849
00:31:38,480 --> 00:31:42,290
in the space but also don't feel that

850
00:31:41,150 --> 00:31:43,670
you have to implement the whole thing

851
00:31:42,290 --> 00:31:45,980
start with just a couple of detection

852
00:31:43,670 --> 00:31:47,570
points and move on from there it's the

853
00:31:45,980 --> 00:31:52,400
classic perfection being the enemy of

854
00:31:47,570 --> 00:31:54,590
the good don't do that so I've got kind

855
00:31:52,400 --> 00:31:56,150
of a closing idea just to throw into

856
00:31:54,590 --> 00:31:58,730
this before I go into questions which is

857
00:31:56,150 --> 00:32:00,620
so MWR is a sort of research that

858
00:31:58,730 --> 00:32:02,240
organization and I came across something

859
00:32:00,620 --> 00:32:04,189
which is kind of a bit to the left field

860
00:32:02,240 --> 00:32:07,190
I thought there's something here that I

861
00:32:04,190 --> 00:32:09,050
think fits in with this whole attack

862
00:32:07,190 --> 00:32:14,090
aware application thing quite well and

863
00:32:09,050 --> 00:32:15,710
it's the idea of active defense so okay

864
00:32:14,090 --> 00:32:18,470
let's take active defense the sort of

865
00:32:15,710 --> 00:32:21,110
the far side of that is hacking back

866
00:32:18,470 --> 00:32:24,800
which is don't do it not legal not yet

867
00:32:21,110 --> 00:32:28,850
okay there have been moves in both the

868
00:32:24,800 --> 00:32:33,770
US and the UK in order to start removing

869
00:32:28,850 --> 00:32:38,230
some of the legal implications of

870
00:32:33,770 --> 00:32:42,320
actually conducting active defense

871
00:32:38,230 --> 00:32:44,600
against against attackers the UK

872
00:32:42,320 --> 00:32:47,270
national cybersecurity strategy 2016 to

873
00:32:44,600 --> 00:32:49,610
2021 and in states the active defense

874
00:32:47,270 --> 00:32:53,090
certainty bill and the bin of the moves

875
00:32:49,610 --> 00:32:55,189
as well there's a lot more it looks to

876
00:32:53,090 --> 00:32:56,419
us but we don't know where it's going to

877
00:32:55,190 --> 00:32:57,530
go that there is more writing on the

878
00:32:56,420 --> 00:33:00,440
wall that we may be able to take a more

879
00:32:57,530 --> 00:33:02,570
active stance against attackers I might

880
00:33:00,440 --> 00:33:04,310
be just doing things like okay we're

881
00:33:02,570 --> 00:33:05,659
pretty sure being attacked we can go we

882
00:33:04,310 --> 00:33:07,190
can go and profile their site you can go

883
00:33:05,660 --> 00:33:08,190
port scan it or something that might be

884
00:33:07,190 --> 00:33:10,230
a thing

885
00:33:08,190 --> 00:33:13,889
your applications in a great place to do

886
00:33:10,230 --> 00:33:16,919
some of this sort of stuff however not

887
00:33:13,889 --> 00:33:18,029
quite yet so keep your eye on the you're

888
00:33:16,919 --> 00:33:19,649
on the kind of the ball and see what

889
00:33:18,029 --> 00:33:21,750
it's going to go that might be where it

890
00:33:19,649 --> 00:33:22,860
goes but that seems like to me like it

891
00:33:21,750 --> 00:33:26,610
might kind of fit in with this quite

892
00:33:22,860 --> 00:33:28,678
interestingly so that's what I'm going

893
00:33:26,610 --> 00:33:48,949
to say today I'll be happy to take any

894
00:33:28,679 --> 00:33:52,919
questions hi

895
00:33:48,950 --> 00:33:54,929
this kind of thinking to me and I don't

896
00:33:52,919 --> 00:33:57,710
mean to spoil of my own presentation I'm

897
00:33:54,929 --> 00:34:02,549
spoiling my own presentation tomorrow

898
00:33:57,710 --> 00:34:04,590
shouldn't seem revolutionary but it is

899
00:34:02,549 --> 00:34:08,040
what kind of response are you getting

900
00:34:04,590 --> 00:34:09,629
from your customers or potential

901
00:34:08,040 --> 00:34:15,389
customers when you put these kind of

902
00:34:09,629 --> 00:34:18,509
ideas forward okay so I was engaged a

903
00:34:15,389 --> 00:34:20,040
lot of people who are very naive that

904
00:34:18,510 --> 00:34:22,829
terms they're either kind of back in the

905
00:34:20,040 --> 00:34:24,389
Stone Age is doing the quote waterfall

906
00:34:22,829 --> 00:34:26,819
type development very very prescriptive

907
00:34:24,389 --> 00:34:28,290
or they are somewhere typically kind of

908
00:34:26,819 --> 00:34:30,270
transitional I try to move move them

909
00:34:28,290 --> 00:34:34,259
along rather get to engage with anybody

910
00:34:30,270 --> 00:34:36,210
in doing def SEC ops typically you end

911
00:34:34,260 --> 00:34:37,440
up with a little silos security happens

912
00:34:36,210 --> 00:34:38,909
somewhere else

913
00:34:37,440 --> 00:34:40,679
so you get the external things so

914
00:34:38,909 --> 00:34:42,480
actually building it in you kind of need

915
00:34:40,679 --> 00:34:44,099
the developers to be on board with that

916
00:34:42,480 --> 00:34:45,780
message seem just certain amount of

917
00:34:44,099 --> 00:34:48,740
maturity so any organization that's

918
00:34:45,780 --> 00:34:51,210
basically stuck back in the last century

919
00:34:48,739 --> 00:34:53,868
is not really going to be able to do

920
00:34:51,210 --> 00:34:57,690
that the big pushback is a lot of time

921
00:34:53,869 --> 00:34:59,550
and I'm getting some some projects done

922
00:34:57,690 --> 00:35:01,109
internally at MWR and what we're looking

923
00:34:59,550 --> 00:35:03,510
at is actually quite a lot of this stuff

924
00:35:01,109 --> 00:35:05,460
is not as complicated as you might think

925
00:35:03,510 --> 00:35:07,260
because a lot of the detection points

926
00:35:05,460 --> 00:35:09,540
are stuff like s is basically bad input

927
00:35:07,260 --> 00:35:11,520
you know that's being thrown at us this

928
00:35:09,540 --> 00:35:12,990
is clearly an XSS string right okay

929
00:35:11,520 --> 00:35:14,700
straight away we just far and ler to

930
00:35:12,990 --> 00:35:16,410
that this is clearly these things a lot

931
00:35:14,700 --> 00:35:18,509
of that goes into whatever

932
00:35:16,410 --> 00:35:20,640
standard libraries or routines that

933
00:35:18,510 --> 00:35:22,020
you've got for sanitizing input so

934
00:35:20,640 --> 00:35:23,759
straightaway you can actually instrument

935
00:35:22,020 --> 00:35:25,259
that dead quick and get yourselves

936
00:35:23,760 --> 00:35:27,569
straight up to a point of at least

937
00:35:25,260 --> 00:35:29,099
picking up the dare I say it

938
00:35:27,569 --> 00:35:31,920
the low-hanging fruit from that sort of

939
00:35:29,099 --> 00:35:36,390
side of things so it tends to come down

940
00:35:31,920 --> 00:35:37,589
to that's a nice idea but I'm more

941
00:35:36,390 --> 00:35:40,379
interested in getting this product to

942
00:35:37,589 --> 00:35:42,720
market tomorrow under now have two

943
00:35:40,380 --> 00:35:45,390
hundred pen test findings to remediate

944
00:35:42,720 --> 00:35:46,919
so I absolutely agree with you the idea

945
00:35:45,390 --> 00:35:48,538
is not revolutionary which is why you

946
00:35:46,920 --> 00:35:50,460
know was sort of spotting this kind of

947
00:35:48,539 --> 00:35:53,369
starting in about twenty ten but it's

948
00:35:50,460 --> 00:35:55,200
just not going anywhere and whilst I

949
00:35:53,369 --> 00:35:56,609
asked a question in the title of my talk

950
00:35:55,200 --> 00:35:58,859
what has happened these that these

951
00:35:56,609 --> 00:36:00,240
attack or applications I was kind of

952
00:35:58,859 --> 00:36:02,369
hoping that you guys are gonna go Oh

953
00:36:00,240 --> 00:36:03,660
Matt you know what there's this and

954
00:36:02,369 --> 00:36:05,309
there's that and the other thing I go

955
00:36:03,660 --> 00:36:08,910
okay I feel very humble now but now I

956
00:36:05,309 --> 00:36:11,010
know so if anybody does know please feel

957
00:36:08,910 --> 00:36:12,930
free to throw the Rotten Tomatoes at me

958
00:36:11,010 --> 00:36:13,609
now or at least pump you must be the

959
00:36:12,930 --> 00:36:16,770
place

960
00:36:13,609 --> 00:36:19,558
height same question again there are an

961
00:36:16,770 --> 00:36:21,599
occasion ting last tomorrow I'm trying

962
00:36:19,559 --> 00:36:24,029
not to turn this into a self-promotion

963
00:36:21,599 --> 00:36:25,740
exercise but I completely agree with you

964
00:36:24,029 --> 00:36:28,020
there's nothing out there until you

965
00:36:25,740 --> 00:36:29,549
really look for it yeah and then and

966
00:36:28,020 --> 00:36:31,829
then there's a lot it's a case of get

967
00:36:29,549 --> 00:36:33,630
out there and to find it and I shall be

968
00:36:31,829 --> 00:36:35,010
the first person running up to the stage

969
00:36:33,630 --> 00:36:37,349
to talk to you while everybody else goes

970
00:36:35,010 --> 00:36:39,210
to have lunch fantastic I am looking

971
00:36:37,349 --> 00:36:41,039
forward to that as well it's clearly

972
00:36:39,210 --> 00:36:42,869
obviously I am really keen to talk to

973
00:36:41,039 --> 00:36:44,549
anybody that's got thoughts in this

974
00:36:42,869 --> 00:36:47,069
space they do anything like this or

975
00:36:44,549 --> 00:36:49,288
there are products out there or they

976
00:36:47,069 --> 00:36:50,640
think this might be a good approach come

977
00:36:49,289 --> 00:36:52,049
talk I want to want to push this forward

978
00:36:50,640 --> 00:36:52,920
I want to do something with it because I

979
00:36:52,049 --> 00:36:57,538
think it's one of the most exciting

980
00:36:52,920 --> 00:36:58,470
ideas in this sphere there's another as

981
00:36:57,539 --> 00:37:00,359
another angle which I didn't really

982
00:36:58,470 --> 00:37:02,069
touch on as well which is thinking about

983
00:37:00,359 --> 00:37:04,288
the the way that things report up to the

984
00:37:02,069 --> 00:37:05,819
sock if you're getting some these high

985
00:37:04,289 --> 00:37:09,240
fidelity alerts and you can standardize

986
00:37:05,819 --> 00:37:10,950
them in some way that might be also

987
00:37:09,240 --> 00:37:13,618
quite effective for when you're trying

988
00:37:10,950 --> 00:37:15,750
to onboard lots and lots of different

989
00:37:13,619 --> 00:37:17,609
applications that it doesn't happen in

990
00:37:15,750 --> 00:37:18,839
the absence of project and as far as

991
00:37:17,609 --> 00:37:21,328
more there's no sort of standardization

992
00:37:18,839 --> 00:37:27,140
for that but that's just another another

993
00:37:21,329 --> 00:37:27,140
take on it okay anybody else

994
00:37:29,130 --> 00:37:38,619
please Chappell frontier there is

995
00:37:36,670 --> 00:37:43,150
something called zero trust model so

996
00:37:38,619 --> 00:37:46,450
they really do act aware application on

997
00:37:43,150 --> 00:37:48,730
the atom solution iodine solution is the

998
00:37:46,450 --> 00:37:51,368
one which is where the authentication of

999
00:37:48,730 --> 00:37:55,930
users coming from different areas coming

1000
00:37:51,369 --> 00:37:58,060
so is it a good point good to push it to

1001
00:37:55,930 --> 00:38:00,940
the attacker where application on the

1002
00:37:58,060 --> 00:38:01,650
hammer and that on the application

1003
00:38:00,940 --> 00:38:05,260
itself

1004
00:38:01,650 --> 00:38:07,300
okay so pushing pushing it into I damn

1005
00:38:05,260 --> 00:38:11,710
well absolutely I'll say authentication

1006
00:38:07,300 --> 00:38:13,109
and knowing your user that's where you

1007
00:38:11,710 --> 00:38:16,510
have all the history of a user

1008
00:38:13,109 --> 00:38:17,740
authenticating right see it is not only

1009
00:38:16,510 --> 00:38:19,630
one application even multiple

1010
00:38:17,740 --> 00:38:22,240
application and attacker is trying to

1011
00:38:19,630 --> 00:38:23,920
not only get one application now that

1012
00:38:22,240 --> 00:38:25,899
he's going to do the propping of entire

1013
00:38:23,920 --> 00:38:27,940
network problem of entire application

1014
00:38:25,900 --> 00:38:29,650
which ever is applications weaker so

1015
00:38:27,940 --> 00:38:31,270
he's gonna do a man attack an

1016
00:38:29,650 --> 00:38:34,630
application which is not even attack our

1017
00:38:31,270 --> 00:38:36,520
application yeah so the item is an

1018
00:38:34,630 --> 00:38:38,680
important part of your your bigger

1019
00:38:36,520 --> 00:38:39,849
solution you have you have a set of

1020
00:38:38,680 --> 00:38:41,200
application you have another set of

1021
00:38:39,849 --> 00:38:42,880
applications we can each respond and go

1022
00:38:41,200 --> 00:38:45,040
oh I'm not thinking this is great I'm

1023
00:38:42,880 --> 00:38:46,420
spotting some user behavior that can

1024
00:38:45,040 --> 00:38:48,670
going to be fed back into your item

1025
00:38:46,420 --> 00:38:50,640
solution the problem you've got is that

1026
00:38:48,670 --> 00:38:52,930
item is typically but not always

1027
00:38:50,640 --> 00:38:54,490
consumed as a service from an external

1028
00:38:52,930 --> 00:38:57,669
product and the products and the

1029
00:38:54,490 --> 00:38:58,959
services are not yet it's a sort of

1030
00:38:57,670 --> 00:39:02,050
aware of being able to take sort of a

1031
00:38:58,960 --> 00:39:03,520
lot of feedback in to say actually I'm

1032
00:39:02,050 --> 00:39:07,599
now suspicious about this after this

1033
00:39:03,520 --> 00:39:11,470
this user so yes it's part of the big

1034
00:39:07,599 --> 00:39:12,849
solution but I don't think it's they're

1035
00:39:11,470 --> 00:39:15,459
quite mature enough yet to be able to do

1036
00:39:12,849 --> 00:39:18,190
that okay how easy is it to immigrate

1037
00:39:15,460 --> 00:39:19,570
this since what or into the any

1038
00:39:18,190 --> 00:39:21,119
application like what are the different

1039
00:39:19,570 --> 00:39:25,390
type of obligation mobile application

1040
00:39:21,119 --> 00:39:26,740
publication how easy is it to integrate

1041
00:39:25,390 --> 00:39:28,750
depends on your applications been

1042
00:39:26,740 --> 00:39:31,029
designed it's how long is a piece of

1043
00:39:28,750 --> 00:39:32,589
string in some respects and I know the

1044
00:39:31,030 --> 00:39:35,280
manufactures stringing continuous length

1045
00:39:32,589 --> 00:39:37,270
nowadays has a bit of a problem and it's

1046
00:39:35,280 --> 00:39:38,440
it depends how your application is

1047
00:39:37,270 --> 00:39:39,530
structured if you have things that are

1048
00:39:38,440 --> 00:39:41,300
consistent such as

1049
00:39:39,530 --> 00:39:43,190
libraries for using things saying doing

1050
00:39:41,300 --> 00:39:45,710
authentication for doing input

1051
00:39:43,190 --> 00:39:46,610
validation output encoding lots of

1052
00:39:45,710 --> 00:39:47,930
things like that you can actually

1053
00:39:46,610 --> 00:39:49,520
there's some places here we go

1054
00:39:47,930 --> 00:39:51,350
these are really really good places just

1055
00:39:49,520 --> 00:39:54,020
to integrate a quick check so you can

1056
00:39:51,350 --> 00:39:56,839
start to get some of that relatively

1057
00:39:54,020 --> 00:39:58,460
quickly in terms of doing the whole

1058
00:39:56,840 --> 00:39:59,600
thing you know kind of going saying

1059
00:39:58,460 --> 00:40:01,340
actually we're going to look at it and

1060
00:39:59,600 --> 00:40:03,500
we're going to be as sophisticated as we

1061
00:40:01,340 --> 00:40:05,060
possibly can well you're never going to

1062
00:40:03,500 --> 00:40:06,890
quite get there you're always going to

1063
00:40:05,060 --> 00:40:08,360
be finding more and more interesting

1064
00:40:06,890 --> 00:40:11,810
ways to do it they get more and more

1065
00:40:08,360 --> 00:40:15,110
sophisticated and harder to spot so it's

1066
00:40:11,810 --> 00:40:16,820
a it's got a big curve I think getting

1067
00:40:15,110 --> 00:40:18,950
up there as as soon as you can is I

1068
00:40:16,820 --> 00:40:20,330
think is a great thing to do getting

1069
00:40:18,950 --> 00:40:21,470
that to the top you know getting getting

1070
00:40:20,330 --> 00:40:24,230
right at the top you're never going to

1071
00:40:21,470 --> 00:40:25,490
quite you know get to 100% but you're

1072
00:40:24,230 --> 00:40:26,990
always going to be trying there as you

1073
00:40:25,490 --> 00:40:29,479
kind of got some more sophisticated

1074
00:40:26,990 --> 00:40:31,490
ideas as to how to detect some of the

1075
00:40:29,480 --> 00:40:32,630
really top-tier attackers in here and

1076
00:40:31,490 --> 00:40:34,819
you're always going to be adding in more

1077
00:40:32,630 --> 00:40:36,170
more checks and you kind of I just start

1078
00:40:34,820 --> 00:40:40,940
to do that like it's going to take

1079
00:40:36,170 --> 00:40:43,510
longer to longer to implement thank you

1080
00:40:40,940 --> 00:40:43,510
very much Matt

1081
00:40:49,220 --> 00:40:53,299
so when she served
