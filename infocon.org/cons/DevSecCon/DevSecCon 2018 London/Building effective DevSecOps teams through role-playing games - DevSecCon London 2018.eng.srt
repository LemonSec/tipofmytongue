1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:04,890
well not quite Guns N'Roses but that

2
00:00:02,909 --> 00:00:06,930
might have woken you up and good morning

3
00:00:04,890 --> 00:00:08,010
thank you for coming so early we are

4
00:00:06,930 --> 00:00:11,460
going to start off with the very

5
00:00:08,010 --> 00:00:14,790
exciting title of building effective dev

6
00:00:11,460 --> 00:00:16,820
ops teams through role-playing games in

7
00:00:14,790 --> 00:00:18,960
order to do this we're gonna need a map

8
00:00:16,820 --> 00:00:21,330
we're going to need some miniatures and

9
00:00:18,960 --> 00:00:25,320
we're gonna need some dice now did

10
00:00:21,330 --> 00:00:25,979
anybody bring dice no no dice that's

11
00:00:25,320 --> 00:00:27,660
okay

12
00:00:25,980 --> 00:00:29,699
we'll do some live-action role-playing

13
00:00:27,660 --> 00:00:31,230
then what we can live-action

14
00:00:29,699 --> 00:00:33,450
role-playing is when you can for example

15
00:00:31,230 --> 00:00:35,760
dress up like vampires run around

16
00:00:33,450 --> 00:00:38,730
buildings and instead of having dice

17
00:00:35,760 --> 00:00:42,059
your method of conflict resolution was

18
00:00:38,730 --> 00:00:43,500
rock paper and scissors which quite

19
00:00:42,059 --> 00:00:46,980
honestly I think it's a quite logical

20
00:00:43,500 --> 00:00:48,899
way of doing conflict resolution of

21
00:00:46,980 --> 00:00:50,730
course with live-action role-playing

22
00:00:48,899 --> 00:00:53,100
games role-playing game role-playing

23
00:00:50,730 --> 00:00:55,140
exercises some of you might actually be

24
00:00:53,100 --> 00:00:57,449
even familiar with them already whether

25
00:00:55,140 --> 00:00:59,070
you have a military background whether

26
00:00:57,449 --> 00:01:00,899
you're doing them with incident response

27
00:00:59,070 --> 00:01:03,449
or so on there's actually quite a long

28
00:01:00,899 --> 00:01:05,640
history of tabletop exercises in

29
00:01:03,449 --> 00:01:07,979
wargaming but we'll touch on that a

30
00:01:05,640 --> 00:01:09,960
little bit at the end but first I wanted

31
00:01:07,979 --> 00:01:12,060
to highlight one of the important

32
00:01:09,960 --> 00:01:15,830
aspects of them which is the human

33
00:01:12,060 --> 00:01:18,330
aspect yesterday we heard some fantastic

34
00:01:15,830 --> 00:01:20,850
presentations about infrastructure as

35
00:01:18,330 --> 00:01:23,280
code about building security controls

36
00:01:20,850 --> 00:01:25,890
within our cloud environments all very

37
00:01:23,280 --> 00:01:27,840
important very key to scaling but one of

38
00:01:25,890 --> 00:01:30,600
the things that we shouldn't lose sight

39
00:01:27,840 --> 00:01:33,150
of is that we're actually working with

40
00:01:30,600 --> 00:01:36,899
people and we're also working for people

41
00:01:33,150 --> 00:01:39,210
as we build these systems so as a

42
00:01:36,900 --> 00:01:41,850
precursor I do still want to highlight

43
00:01:39,210 --> 00:01:45,539
that in my heart of hearts automation I

44
00:01:41,850 --> 00:01:47,789
recognize as key to the modern DevOps

45
00:01:45,540 --> 00:01:50,670
movements as well as just it makes our

46
00:01:47,790 --> 00:01:53,310
lives easier by being able to say

47
00:01:50,670 --> 00:01:56,670
development and operations are sharing

48
00:01:53,310 --> 00:01:59,880
the pain as well as sharing the

49
00:01:56,670 --> 00:02:01,799
responsibility of not only building code

50
00:01:59,880 --> 00:02:04,890
but maintaining it and deploying it

51
00:02:01,799 --> 00:02:07,680
those are really good ways of building

52
00:02:04,890 --> 00:02:10,110
bringing teams together and and building

53
00:02:07,680 --> 00:02:10,800
the idea that everybody has ownership of

54
00:02:10,110 --> 00:02:13,050
what they're building

55
00:02:10,800 --> 00:02:13,940
so automation is important so nothing

56
00:02:13,050 --> 00:02:15,950
what I say today

57
00:02:13,940 --> 00:02:17,720
hopefully we'll convey the idea that

58
00:02:15,950 --> 00:02:19,700
automation should be dismissed or

59
00:02:17,720 --> 00:02:22,070
automation is failing us in some way

60
00:02:19,700 --> 00:02:25,089
what I'm trying to highlight is that

61
00:02:22,070 --> 00:02:28,010
security angle that yes we're building

62
00:02:25,090 --> 00:02:30,170
applications with people meaning we've

63
00:02:28,010 --> 00:02:32,090
moved and we've moved on hopefully from

64
00:02:30,170 --> 00:02:34,459
the idea that the security team is the

65
00:02:32,090 --> 00:02:36,950
sheriff saying thou shalt not do this or

66
00:02:34,460 --> 00:02:40,220
thou shalt come to me before you can

67
00:02:36,950 --> 00:02:42,859
release this application we want work

68
00:02:40,220 --> 00:02:44,510
with them work with the DevOps teams and

69
00:02:42,860 --> 00:02:47,420
one of the things that I'll highlight as

70
00:02:44,510 --> 00:02:49,100
well threat modeling we have some again

71
00:02:47,420 --> 00:02:50,839
some great conversations and great

72
00:02:49,100 --> 00:02:53,090
presentations yesterday about threat

73
00:02:50,840 --> 00:02:55,280
models ways to scale them ways to

74
00:02:53,090 --> 00:02:59,390
automate them we also want to make sure

75
00:02:55,280 --> 00:03:01,820
that we remember people in them and to

76
00:02:59,390 --> 00:03:04,910
go back in time a little bit in the late

77
00:03:01,820 --> 00:03:07,280
1999 I was busy having some meaningful

78
00:03:04,910 --> 00:03:09,140
Dungeons & Dragons campaigns while other

79
00:03:07,280 --> 00:03:11,690
people were doing some meaningful

80
00:03:09,140 --> 00:03:13,989
research on usability so this is quite I

81
00:03:11,690 --> 00:03:16,940
think an important and formative paper

82
00:03:13,990 --> 00:03:19,730
why Johnny can't encrypt essentially

83
00:03:16,940 --> 00:03:22,370
saying we have PGP the math is pretty

84
00:03:19,730 --> 00:03:24,769
fantastic we have mechanisms where we

85
00:03:22,370 --> 00:03:28,430
can encrypt email send and receive

86
00:03:24,770 --> 00:03:31,400
encrypted email it's pretty resistant to

87
00:03:28,430 --> 00:03:34,070
integrity issues pretty resistant to

88
00:03:31,400 --> 00:03:35,810
confidentiality issues but the

89
00:03:34,070 --> 00:03:38,450
availability issues were pretty weak

90
00:03:35,810 --> 00:03:41,030
mostly in the sense of the usability of

91
00:03:38,450 --> 00:03:42,950
the system and was trying to go beyond

92
00:03:41,030 --> 00:03:45,230
the idea that if we're just saying users

93
00:03:42,950 --> 00:03:47,630
are stupid or developers are lazy or

94
00:03:45,230 --> 00:03:49,369
developers don't care about security we

95
00:03:47,630 --> 00:03:51,799
might be actually missing what the real

96
00:03:49,370 --> 00:03:54,709
issue here is that sure we have some

97
00:03:51,800 --> 00:03:57,140
fancy math and important math behind PGP

98
00:03:54,709 --> 00:03:59,090
but maybe we're failing the users and

99
00:03:57,140 --> 00:04:01,518
for calling them stupid we're calling

100
00:03:59,090 --> 00:04:03,709
them lazy we're essentially building up

101
00:04:01,519 --> 00:04:05,630
our own fantasy campaign setting where

102
00:04:03,709 --> 00:04:07,640
users and developers or somebody you

103
00:04:05,630 --> 00:04:09,350
know aren't as smart as we are or aren't

104
00:04:07,640 --> 00:04:11,929
as smart and aren't as good as we are

105
00:04:09,350 --> 00:04:14,450
so this is what I wanted to turn the

106
00:04:11,930 --> 00:04:17,329
turn our attention to role playing games

107
00:04:14,450 --> 00:04:18,918
I think it's a pretty effective metaphor

108
00:04:17,329 --> 00:04:21,560
in the sense that it's about

109
00:04:18,918 --> 00:04:23,450
collaborative storytelling it's about a

110
00:04:21,560 --> 00:04:26,479
group of people working towards a shared

111
00:04:23,450 --> 00:04:27,740
goal now the shared people may have a

112
00:04:26,479 --> 00:04:30,050
few different motivation

113
00:04:27,740 --> 00:04:32,660
how they get to that goal but it's still

114
00:04:30,050 --> 00:04:34,310
a shared goal and DevOps team security

115
00:04:32,660 --> 00:04:37,250
teams of course still have shared goals

116
00:04:34,310 --> 00:04:39,560
of meaning Sprint's meaning certain

117
00:04:37,250 --> 00:04:40,880
milestones meeting certain compliance

118
00:04:39,560 --> 00:04:42,919
requirements and so on

119
00:04:40,880 --> 00:04:45,139
but another important thing also wanted

120
00:04:42,919 --> 00:04:46,400
to highlight too is because it's

121
00:04:45,139 --> 00:04:48,139
collaborative and because it's

122
00:04:46,400 --> 00:04:50,810
storytelling it also requires a lot of

123
00:04:48,139 --> 00:04:52,729
communication exercises and while we

124
00:04:50,810 --> 00:04:53,300
have a lot of things like the OWASP up

125
00:04:52,729 --> 00:04:55,818
10

126
00:04:53,300 --> 00:04:58,190
we have the cwe we have lists and tables

127
00:04:55,819 --> 00:05:00,139
and so on of all kinds of technical

128
00:04:58,190 --> 00:05:01,969
controls or technical issues and

129
00:05:00,139 --> 00:05:04,130
weaknesses and risks we don't really

130
00:05:01,970 --> 00:05:06,259
have the same type of lists or at least

131
00:05:04,130 --> 00:05:07,969
the same shared lists when we're talking

132
00:05:06,259 --> 00:05:10,310
about communication and working with

133
00:05:07,970 --> 00:05:12,650
people so of course the first list I

134
00:05:10,310 --> 00:05:15,729
wanted to share is how this would map to

135
00:05:12,650 --> 00:05:17,948
our day to day jobs

136
00:05:15,729 --> 00:05:20,508
barbarians I put up there because

137
00:05:17,949 --> 00:05:22,639
barbarians at one point in D&D we're

138
00:05:20,509 --> 00:05:24,680
actually illiterate and if you've ever

139
00:05:22,639 --> 00:05:27,580
tried to read someone else's Perl code

140
00:05:24,680 --> 00:05:30,860
for example I think that's a pretty fair

141
00:05:27,580 --> 00:05:32,539
explanation there and of course on the

142
00:05:30,860 --> 00:05:34,610
bards always just like to show off and

143
00:05:32,539 --> 00:05:39,550
have the attention I'll just leave that

144
00:05:34,610 --> 00:05:42,289
is um again an exercise for the audience

145
00:05:39,550 --> 00:05:45,139
but also want to say that our metaphor

146
00:05:42,289 --> 00:05:47,930
isn't quite perfect so we can't just go

147
00:05:45,139 --> 00:05:49,759
around as a security team mandating what

148
00:05:47,930 --> 00:05:52,310
you know what everyone should be doing

149
00:05:49,759 --> 00:05:55,130
we can't we need to move beyond those

150
00:05:52,310 --> 00:05:58,669
90s of just use PGP for encrypting your

151
00:05:55,130 --> 00:06:00,979
email or just go and deploy HTTPS we had

152
00:05:58,669 --> 00:06:02,900
a lot of you know it's the InfoSec

153
00:06:00,979 --> 00:06:04,280
conferences that would shame people

154
00:06:02,900 --> 00:06:06,349
saying look at all these websites not

155
00:06:04,280 --> 00:06:09,440
using HTTPS look at all these tools I

156
00:06:06,349 --> 00:06:10,550
can use for intercepting HTTP traffic or

157
00:06:09,440 --> 00:06:14,780
an unencrypted traffic

158
00:06:10,550 --> 00:06:16,639
it wasn't until 10 years ago my math is

159
00:06:14,780 --> 00:06:18,559
a little bit off where we had a tool or

160
00:06:16,639 --> 00:06:21,650
we had a project like let's encrypt that

161
00:06:18,560 --> 00:06:24,169
twisted dad a little bit and said rather

162
00:06:21,650 --> 00:06:25,638
than just blaming and shouting doom and

163
00:06:24,169 --> 00:06:27,979
gloom that no one's encrypting their

164
00:06:25,639 --> 00:06:30,319
websites let's actually give some some

165
00:06:27,979 --> 00:06:32,810
give some DevOps teams a way to have

166
00:06:30,319 --> 00:06:34,819
certificates for free and in acne

167
00:06:32,810 --> 00:06:36,770
protocol to make it easy to manage them

168
00:06:34,819 --> 00:06:38,779
so not only can they obtain a

169
00:06:36,770 --> 00:06:39,589
certificate but they can manage the life

170
00:06:38,779 --> 00:06:41,669
cycle of it

171
00:06:39,589 --> 00:06:43,379
so Indies aam

172
00:06:41,669 --> 00:06:44,878
in these live-action role-playing games

173
00:06:43,379 --> 00:06:46,919
like i mentioned the rock-paper-scissors

174
00:06:44,879 --> 00:06:49,800
you could also walk around with your

175
00:06:46,919 --> 00:06:51,599
arms out and be majestic and people

176
00:06:49,800 --> 00:06:52,949
would listen to you which I'm lucky

177
00:06:51,599 --> 00:06:54,569
enough I don't have to do that because I

178
00:06:52,949 --> 00:06:56,250
look silly doing so and you're also

179
00:06:54,569 --> 00:06:59,789
listening to me because you kindly came

180
00:06:56,250 --> 00:07:01,139
to this conference but we want to move

181
00:06:59,789 --> 00:07:02,789
beyond that we want to build up our

182
00:07:01,139 --> 00:07:05,430
shared vocabulary of how we're going to

183
00:07:02,789 --> 00:07:07,318
talk with people build empathy which i

184
00:07:05,430 --> 00:07:09,810
think is quite important as well as

185
00:07:07,319 --> 00:07:12,439
acknowledge or tease out some ideas what

186
00:07:09,810 --> 00:07:16,590
are threats to these types of exercises

187
00:07:12,439 --> 00:07:18,990
so communication is pretty easy the

188
00:07:16,590 --> 00:07:21,960
picture there is of a gelatinous cube

189
00:07:18,990 --> 00:07:24,300
that is a famous D&D monster that is a

190
00:07:21,960 --> 00:07:26,969
10 by 10 foot cube that you can't see

191
00:07:24,300 --> 00:07:29,400
and is a great threat to adventurers as

192
00:07:26,969 --> 00:07:31,529
they walk down corridors but what that

193
00:07:29,400 --> 00:07:33,929
really means is I didn't have a good

194
00:07:31,529 --> 00:07:36,029
metaphor other than to say look out

195
00:07:33,930 --> 00:07:37,520
there's a jot on this cube here what

196
00:07:36,029 --> 00:07:39,509
we're really trying to say is

197
00:07:37,520 --> 00:07:40,049
communication is also about active

198
00:07:39,509 --> 00:07:42,389
listening

199
00:07:40,050 --> 00:07:43,770
it's about rather than just saying go

200
00:07:42,389 --> 00:07:46,560
forth and you know why aren't you

201
00:07:43,770 --> 00:07:49,799
deploying HTTP you know go go turn on

202
00:07:46,560 --> 00:07:51,779
HTTPS PCI requires HTTPS it's also

203
00:07:49,800 --> 00:07:54,949
listening what are the problems that

204
00:07:51,779 --> 00:07:57,509
people are having to deploy that why is

205
00:07:54,949 --> 00:07:59,669
obtaining a certificate something that

206
00:07:57,509 --> 00:08:00,180
is a budget item the people are dealing

207
00:07:59,669 --> 00:08:02,490
with

208
00:08:00,180 --> 00:08:05,099
there's also simpler exercises and these

209
00:08:02,490 --> 00:08:07,319
are simple or things like just

210
00:08:05,099 --> 00:08:09,240
one-on-one exercises acknowledging that

211
00:08:07,319 --> 00:08:12,000
you heard something especially this is

212
00:08:09,240 --> 00:08:13,439
especially true when you're repeating

213
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:15,509
vulnerability information that might

214
00:08:13,439 --> 00:08:17,819
come in from a bug bounty program trying

215
00:08:15,509 --> 00:08:19,979
to explain this is what the actual risk

216
00:08:17,819 --> 00:08:22,529
is of this of this cross-site scripting

217
00:08:19,979 --> 00:08:25,139
vulnerability or here is what this weird

218
00:08:22,529 --> 00:08:28,189
logic bug means or this is why this

219
00:08:25,139 --> 00:08:30,449
vulnerability is a problem and then

220
00:08:28,189 --> 00:08:32,519
figuring out are the developers or

221
00:08:30,449 --> 00:08:34,680
talking with actually understanding how

222
00:08:32,519 --> 00:08:37,110
you're explaining that or are they

223
00:08:34,679 --> 00:08:39,899
missing the point having either asking

224
00:08:37,110 --> 00:08:41,610
them to repeat back or when they're

225
00:08:39,899 --> 00:08:43,549
saying ah I understand what that

226
00:08:41,610 --> 00:08:46,079
solution is I'm going to do XYZ

227
00:08:43,549 --> 00:08:48,269
repeating back to them and saying I

228
00:08:46,079 --> 00:08:51,089
heard what you I heard your approach is

229
00:08:48,269 --> 00:08:53,160
going to be adding some extra input

230
00:08:51,089 --> 00:08:55,890
validation and you're going to blacklist

231
00:08:53,160 --> 00:08:58,949
this JavaScript :

232
00:08:55,890 --> 00:09:00,420
but that might fail a great example of

233
00:08:58,950 --> 00:09:02,490
this could be that discussion we saw

234
00:09:00,420 --> 00:09:05,459
yesterday about variant analysis and

235
00:09:02,490 --> 00:09:07,230
vulnerabilities the idea of having that

236
00:09:05,460 --> 00:09:09,930
communication cycle that goes beyond

237
00:09:07,230 --> 00:09:12,480
just here's a bug go fix it but actually

238
00:09:09,930 --> 00:09:15,810
taking the time to analyze look into and

239
00:09:12,480 --> 00:09:17,850
actually have something much shorter or

240
00:09:15,810 --> 00:09:20,069
more condensed than that six month cycle

241
00:09:17,850 --> 00:09:22,530
between here's a bug report that wasn't

242
00:09:20,070 --> 00:09:24,330
necessarily acknowledged and no feedback

243
00:09:22,530 --> 00:09:26,790
was given in terms of what the fix was

244
00:09:24,330 --> 00:09:29,040
and then having that extended of time of

245
00:09:26,790 --> 00:09:33,270
how it would be how what the solution

246
00:09:29,040 --> 00:09:35,069
should be empathy I think is a much more

247
00:09:33,270 --> 00:09:37,680
important aspect or it's an emergent

248
00:09:35,070 --> 00:09:41,510
property of good communication I'll say

249
00:09:37,680 --> 00:09:43,949
it's essentially the idea of

250
00:09:41,510 --> 00:09:46,860
understanding where people are coming

251
00:09:43,950 --> 00:09:48,840
from understanding that DevOps problem

252
00:09:46,860 --> 00:09:51,810
why don't we have HTTP deployed

253
00:09:48,840 --> 00:09:54,240
everywhere what are the what are the

254
00:09:51,810 --> 00:09:56,099
current sprint what are the current

255
00:09:54,240 --> 00:09:58,440
features within a sprint what are

256
00:09:56,100 --> 00:10:00,270
developers working on this also comes

257
00:09:58,440 --> 00:10:02,490
into play and we'll have highlights um

258
00:10:00,270 --> 00:10:04,470
more concrete examples shortly when we

259
00:10:02,490 --> 00:10:07,220
talk about threat models and what people

260
00:10:04,470 --> 00:10:11,640
look like within our threat models

261
00:10:07,220 --> 00:10:14,690
speaking of threats there is the the

262
00:10:11,640 --> 00:10:17,280
classic what alignment are you in D&D

263
00:10:14,690 --> 00:10:19,920
one of the things I'd like to turn here

264
00:10:17,280 --> 00:10:22,470
is that the threats to communication are

265
00:10:19,920 --> 00:10:25,020
not mostly about people it's about their

266
00:10:22,470 --> 00:10:27,260
behavior there was a fantastic quote

267
00:10:25,020 --> 00:10:30,360
from an Australian a couple years ago

268
00:10:27,260 --> 00:10:33,210
who said the the standard you walk by is

269
00:10:30,360 --> 00:10:35,730
the standard you accept and that kind of

270
00:10:33,210 --> 00:10:37,920
highlights the idea that threats to

271
00:10:35,730 --> 00:10:39,660
communication threats to empathy are

272
00:10:37,920 --> 00:10:41,939
things that are behaviors they're not

273
00:10:39,660 --> 00:10:44,069
actually people sure somebody may be bad

274
00:10:41,940 --> 00:10:47,250
or they may be good they may be lawful

275
00:10:44,070 --> 00:10:49,080
neutral or chaotic evil but they may

276
00:10:47,250 --> 00:10:51,900
still have behaviors that are helpful

277
00:10:49,080 --> 00:10:54,060
they still may be empathic or they may

278
00:10:51,900 --> 00:10:56,040
be blaming the developers for being lazy

279
00:10:54,060 --> 00:10:57,479
they may be blaming users for being

280
00:10:56,040 --> 00:11:00,360
stupid because they're clicking on a

281
00:10:57,480 --> 00:11:02,190
phishing link things like that the other

282
00:11:00,360 --> 00:11:04,350
thing is there's the concepts of a ratio

283
00:11:02,190 --> 00:11:08,499
or essentializing these essentially are

284
00:11:04,350 --> 00:11:11,319
these essentially it can't be threats to

285
00:11:08,499 --> 00:11:14,049
all teams the idea of erasure not giving

286
00:11:11,319 --> 00:11:16,478
credit to when one people are coming up

287
00:11:14,049 --> 00:11:18,809
with solutions not sharing credit when

288
00:11:16,479 --> 00:11:21,729
people are coming up with solutions or

289
00:11:18,809 --> 00:11:23,368
saying just taking someone and this is

290
00:11:21,729 --> 00:11:28,389
the single dimension of what they are

291
00:11:23,369 --> 00:11:30,459
for example having women in your in your

292
00:11:28,389 --> 00:11:32,979
meetings or women who give presentations

293
00:11:30,459 --> 00:11:35,169
who who are invited to solely speak

294
00:11:32,979 --> 00:11:37,809
about you are women therefore what does

295
00:11:35,169 --> 00:11:41,199
it like to be a woman in InfoSec rather

296
00:11:37,809 --> 00:11:42,608
than what is the latest coolest malware

297
00:11:41,199 --> 00:11:44,649
that you've been reverse engineering

298
00:11:42,609 --> 00:11:46,089
what's this last stressful incident

299
00:11:44,649 --> 00:11:48,519
response that you are working on

300
00:11:46,089 --> 00:11:50,619
something that's relevant maybe to

301
00:11:48,519 --> 00:11:53,979
building a you know building an

302
00:11:50,619 --> 00:11:56,259
application things like that two other

303
00:11:53,979 --> 00:11:59,319
points I want to make around this I this

304
00:11:56,259 --> 00:12:01,449
theme are that as developers we read

305
00:11:59,319 --> 00:12:02,799
other people's code and we learn a lot

306
00:12:01,449 --> 00:12:05,289
from other people's code

307
00:12:02,799 --> 00:12:08,019
what's the pythonic way of walking

308
00:12:05,289 --> 00:12:10,509
through lists or what is the go way of

309
00:12:08,019 --> 00:12:12,479
creating a loop well we can do the

310
00:12:10,509 --> 00:12:15,639
similar thing with codes of conduct so

311
00:12:12,479 --> 00:12:17,769
and I highlight this in the sense of how

312
00:12:15,639 --> 00:12:19,359
can we learn or what can we just do to

313
00:12:17,769 --> 00:12:22,299
educate ourselves and build awareness

314
00:12:19,359 --> 00:12:24,489
for ourselves about what are those

315
00:12:22,299 --> 00:12:27,429
standards of behavior or things that we

316
00:12:24,489 --> 00:12:29,889
would expect and importantly how do

317
00:12:27,429 --> 00:12:32,799
these how do they define consequences or

318
00:12:29,889 --> 00:12:34,419
how do they define a path for conflict

319
00:12:32,799 --> 00:12:36,399
resolution in other words something

320
00:12:34,419 --> 00:12:38,409
beyond just rolling some dice or playing

321
00:12:36,399 --> 00:12:41,289
rock-paper-scissors and figuring out

322
00:12:38,409 --> 00:12:43,779
what to do one of the other things here

323
00:12:41,289 --> 00:12:46,269
is to tease out a little bit of a nuance

324
00:12:43,779 --> 00:12:49,479
between the idea of diversity and

325
00:12:46,269 --> 00:12:51,189
inclusivity so diversity means a lot of

326
00:12:49,479 --> 00:12:53,189
people are showing up and a lot of

327
00:12:51,189 --> 00:12:55,919
different people are showing up or

328
00:12:53,189 --> 00:12:59,679
participating in our DevOps team

329
00:12:55,919 --> 00:13:01,389
inclusivity means we're taking a I think

330
00:12:59,679 --> 00:13:03,429
means we're taking a bit more active

331
00:13:01,389 --> 00:13:04,869
effort to make this a welcomed

332
00:13:03,429 --> 00:13:06,999
environment where people want to come

333
00:13:04,869 --> 00:13:09,189
and participate they want to come to a

334
00:13:06,999 --> 00:13:11,289
conference they want to contribute to

335
00:13:09,189 --> 00:13:13,238
the Linux kernel for example or they

336
00:13:11,289 --> 00:13:15,249
want to contribute to a DevOps team or

337
00:13:13,239 --> 00:13:18,909
Incident Response Team a Blue Team Red

338
00:13:15,249 --> 00:13:22,270
Team and so on in the spirit of

339
00:13:18,909 --> 00:13:24,370
providing additional resources and you

340
00:13:22,270 --> 00:13:27,069
a lot of what I'm describing is not you

341
00:13:24,370 --> 00:13:29,620
know something that I created on my own

342
00:13:27,070 --> 00:13:32,140
as we saw I Johnny can't encrypt already

343
00:13:29,620 --> 00:13:34,330
from 1999 there's a fantastic website

344
00:13:32,140 --> 00:13:36,939
that I like called captain awkward this

345
00:13:34,330 --> 00:13:38,830
is very much non-technical in a sense is

346
00:13:36,940 --> 00:13:42,010
about social interactions and

347
00:13:38,830 --> 00:13:43,600
relationships but if you'd ever like to

348
00:13:42,010 --> 00:13:45,760
read through just as we read through

349
00:13:43,600 --> 00:13:49,120
other people's code to see how people

350
00:13:45,760 --> 00:13:51,580
code well read how this site handles

351
00:13:49,120 --> 00:13:54,250
moderation read how this site handles

352
00:13:51,580 --> 00:13:56,230
conflict how it handles feedback it can

353
00:13:54,250 --> 00:13:57,790
be a great way to either pick and choose

354
00:13:56,230 --> 00:13:59,890
what are some of the behaviors that you

355
00:13:57,790 --> 00:14:04,839
want to model after what are some things

356
00:13:59,890 --> 00:14:06,880
that might inspire you so trying to move

357
00:14:04,840 --> 00:14:08,500
along here at a bit of a fast pace we're

358
00:14:06,880 --> 00:14:10,720
going to turn back now to some threat

359
00:14:08,500 --> 00:14:12,460
models and bring some people into these

360
00:14:10,720 --> 00:14:15,850
threat models so I've been talking about

361
00:14:12,460 --> 00:14:18,070
D&D but there's also cyberpunk so the

362
00:14:15,850 --> 00:14:20,110
late 90s had some fantastic cyberpunk

363
00:14:18,070 --> 00:14:22,480
this is from a game called shadow run

364
00:14:20,110 --> 00:14:25,570
for those of you don't know shadow our

365
00:14:22,480 --> 00:14:27,700
cyberpunk was about at the time it was

366
00:14:25,570 --> 00:14:29,730
imagining things like mega corporations

367
00:14:27,700 --> 00:14:32,320
that were more powerful than countries

368
00:14:29,730 --> 00:14:35,550
things like technology being a threat to

369
00:14:32,320 --> 00:14:38,020
our privacy technology as addictive

370
00:14:35,550 --> 00:14:40,390
technology as a tool of tyrants things

371
00:14:38,020 --> 00:14:42,930
like that so I'm mostly probably an

372
00:14:40,390 --> 00:14:45,790
unrecognizable footnote by now I'm sure

373
00:14:42,930 --> 00:14:48,280
but the idea here is that there's a

374
00:14:45,790 --> 00:14:50,319
couple tropes within gaming rolling four

375
00:14:48,280 --> 00:14:52,720
initiatives but the party statues and

376
00:14:50,320 --> 00:14:55,120
darkness there's some metaphors we can

377
00:14:52,720 --> 00:14:58,780
pull out here one this idea of rolling

378
00:14:55,120 --> 00:15:01,960
for initiative in games Kombat happens

379
00:14:58,780 --> 00:15:03,819
combat can be kind of fun D&D for

380
00:15:01,960 --> 00:15:06,460
example or modern D&D calls out three

381
00:15:03,820 --> 00:15:08,080
major pillars exploration social

382
00:15:06,460 --> 00:15:10,030
interaction which I'm trying to

383
00:15:08,080 --> 00:15:11,470
emphasize here and a little bit of

384
00:15:10,030 --> 00:15:13,660
combat which we'll talk about at the end

385
00:15:11,470 --> 00:15:15,940
but the idea of rolling for initiative

386
00:15:13,660 --> 00:15:19,060
can be great for the meetings that we

387
00:15:15,940 --> 00:15:21,910
have on a daily hopefully not too much

388
00:15:19,060 --> 00:15:24,609
on a daily or weekly basis the idea that

389
00:15:21,910 --> 00:15:27,069
once combat calms or when an event comes

390
00:15:24,610 --> 00:15:29,050
everybody gets to participate in other

391
00:15:27,070 --> 00:15:31,330
words going around a room and avoiding

392
00:15:29,050 --> 00:15:33,939
the idea that here is the person who is

393
00:15:31,330 --> 00:15:36,130
most passionate or here's a person who

394
00:15:33,940 --> 00:15:38,410
is most loud about making a diss

395
00:15:36,130 --> 00:15:41,590
vision or especially something that will

396
00:15:38,410 --> 00:15:43,839
be a decision with many potential

397
00:15:41,590 --> 00:15:46,570
solutions or decision that's potentially

398
00:15:43,840 --> 00:15:48,670
controversial the idea of rolling for

399
00:15:46,570 --> 00:15:51,580
initiative is is handling meetings

400
00:15:48,670 --> 00:15:53,439
insane sure one person has been loud one

401
00:15:51,580 --> 00:15:55,810
person has been dominating but have we

402
00:15:53,440 --> 00:15:57,940
gotten input from everyone within who

403
00:15:55,810 --> 00:15:59,500
was attending the meeting especially the

404
00:15:57,940 --> 00:16:03,310
people that are potentially responsible

405
00:15:59,500 --> 00:16:05,740
for deploying changes or coding changes

406
00:16:03,310 --> 00:16:10,449
or following the decisions that have

407
00:16:05,740 --> 00:16:12,160
been made we can also start to tease out

408
00:16:10,450 --> 00:16:16,060
again how could these different

409
00:16:12,160 --> 00:16:19,079
metaphors can build into technology so

410
00:16:16,060 --> 00:16:21,790
you have obviously things like abuse

411
00:16:19,080 --> 00:16:24,790
also have things like denial of service

412
00:16:21,790 --> 00:16:27,760
against people so there's a variation on

413
00:16:24,790 --> 00:16:29,740
services often asymmetric resource

414
00:16:27,760 --> 00:16:32,800
exhaustion in the sense of bandwidth or

415
00:16:29,740 --> 00:16:35,710
CPU or memory resources but as people

416
00:16:32,800 --> 00:16:38,890
our personal time is also very important

417
00:16:35,710 --> 00:16:41,320
so as we're building applications mobile

418
00:16:38,890 --> 00:16:43,270
applications web applications are we

419
00:16:41,320 --> 00:16:45,610
starting to look at threat models and

420
00:16:43,270 --> 00:16:47,560
people and are looking how that

421
00:16:45,610 --> 00:16:51,010
application can be abused in an

422
00:16:47,560 --> 00:16:54,040
asymmetric way meaning it may take a

423
00:16:51,010 --> 00:16:56,620
hundred people one second to send a DM

424
00:16:54,040 --> 00:16:58,420
to one person but that one person is

425
00:16:56,620 --> 00:17:00,760
going to take possibly a lot longer than

426
00:16:58,420 --> 00:17:03,250
one second to delete a lot of abusive

427
00:17:00,760 --> 00:17:05,579
messages that's an asymmetric cost of

428
00:17:03,250 --> 00:17:07,930
attention so if you don't have a way to

429
00:17:05,579 --> 00:17:10,810
filter you don't have a way to auto

430
00:17:07,930 --> 00:17:12,130
delete for example or bulk delete that's

431
00:17:10,810 --> 00:17:14,679
an area where you can still have a

432
00:17:12,130 --> 00:17:18,100
technical clean tech nickel control that

433
00:17:14,680 --> 00:17:20,410
can address that sort of attack that

434
00:17:18,099 --> 00:17:23,679
sort of abuse the idea of forced

435
00:17:20,410 --> 00:17:27,970
participation being added to a list

436
00:17:23,680 --> 00:17:31,180
being added to a github repo of losers

437
00:17:27,970 --> 00:17:33,640
who played D&D in college or something

438
00:17:31,180 --> 00:17:36,520
like that it's the idea of here is that

439
00:17:33,640 --> 00:17:41,680
technical control of can you opt-in

440
00:17:36,520 --> 00:17:43,810
people or do they have to opt out also

441
00:17:41,680 --> 00:17:44,650
the idea of threats security that comes

442
00:17:43,810 --> 00:17:46,300
at a cost

443
00:17:44,650 --> 00:17:49,150
this goes back to that let's encrypt

444
00:17:46,300 --> 00:17:49,960
model and when when everyone in was call

445
00:17:49,150 --> 00:17:51,970
it was

446
00:17:49,960 --> 00:17:54,279
calling out websites and naming and

447
00:17:51,970 --> 00:17:56,980
shaming websites for not deploying a GPS

448
00:17:54,279 --> 00:17:58,570
a lot of websites don't didn't have

449
00:17:56,980 --> 00:18:01,149
revenue a lot of websites didn't

450
00:17:58,570 --> 00:18:04,149
couldn't pay for HTTPS certificates or

451
00:18:01,149 --> 00:18:06,370
TLS certificates so security as a cost

452
00:18:04,149 --> 00:18:09,789
can still be a threat especially if

453
00:18:06,370 --> 00:18:12,668
you're saying security as a cost must

454
00:18:09,789 --> 00:18:14,529
come from an iPhone versus an Android

455
00:18:12,669 --> 00:18:16,630
phone which have you know depending on

456
00:18:14,529 --> 00:18:19,510
the the maker of the Android phone has

457
00:18:16,630 --> 00:18:21,130
different security models around it and

458
00:18:19,510 --> 00:18:23,950
of course there's also the idea of

459
00:18:21,130 --> 00:18:25,630
privacy a couple more I want to go

460
00:18:23,950 --> 00:18:28,990
through I'm getting some more details

461
00:18:25,630 --> 00:18:30,730
but there's some other things that can

462
00:18:28,990 --> 00:18:32,919
emerge out of here some other concepts

463
00:18:30,730 --> 00:18:36,309
to consider in your threat modeling is

464
00:18:32,919 --> 00:18:37,899
what about asymmetric features I wanted

465
00:18:36,309 --> 00:18:39,428
to use asymmetric a second time so

466
00:18:37,899 --> 00:18:42,039
that's why I call this out but to

467
00:18:39,429 --> 00:18:44,559
explain that a little bit more think of

468
00:18:42,039 --> 00:18:47,860
chat mechanisms chat mechanisms

469
00:18:44,559 --> 00:18:50,049
communication within apps are very

470
00:18:47,860 --> 00:18:53,350
helpful very important many companies

471
00:18:50,049 --> 00:18:55,529
have gone all-in on slack for example so

472
00:18:53,350 --> 00:18:58,299
that is a great example of having

473
00:18:55,529 --> 00:19:01,090
communication but there are games for

474
00:18:58,299 --> 00:19:03,220
example that love chat systems that are

475
00:19:01,090 --> 00:19:05,199
quite open that have voice chat there

476
00:19:03,220 --> 00:19:07,480
are other games that minimize the

477
00:19:05,200 --> 00:19:11,350
interaction so look at the difference

478
00:19:07,480 --> 00:19:12,789
between having a discord server where

479
00:19:11,350 --> 00:19:15,520
people can talk to each other while

480
00:19:12,789 --> 00:19:17,230
playing World of Warcraft versus how

481
00:19:15,520 --> 00:19:19,510
people would interact with a game like

482
00:19:17,230 --> 00:19:22,510
hearthstone hearthstone if you're not

483
00:19:19,510 --> 00:19:25,299
familiar basically it's an online card

484
00:19:22,510 --> 00:19:27,370
playing game and you have a predefined

485
00:19:25,299 --> 00:19:30,850
list of I think maybe eight or ten

486
00:19:27,370 --> 00:19:32,649
different phrases who are ways of

487
00:19:30,850 --> 00:19:35,260
interacting with someone else you can

488
00:19:32,649 --> 00:19:37,750
basically say you know good job or I'm

489
00:19:35,260 --> 00:19:40,059
going to get you or things like that but

490
00:19:37,750 --> 00:19:42,399
by boiling this down to you know a

491
00:19:40,059 --> 00:19:44,940
finite way of interacting you're also

492
00:19:42,399 --> 00:19:47,529
minimizing chances for abuse between

493
00:19:44,940 --> 00:19:49,750
different populations of players whether

494
00:19:47,529 --> 00:19:53,380
they're very different between age so

495
00:19:49,750 --> 00:19:56,320
ten year-old kids versus you know 40

496
00:19:53,380 --> 00:19:58,779
year-old 40 year-olds playing with them

497
00:19:56,320 --> 00:20:01,450
people who want to smack talk versus

498
00:19:58,779 --> 00:20:03,059
those who don't so that's an example of

499
00:20:01,450 --> 00:20:05,429
having a feature

500
00:20:03,059 --> 00:20:07,019
that can or going through threat models

501
00:20:05,429 --> 00:20:09,539
and understanding who is our user

502
00:20:07,019 --> 00:20:11,460
population is it going to be a group of

503
00:20:09,539 --> 00:20:13,129
like-minded people that are opting in

504
00:20:11,460 --> 00:20:16,740
and wanting to have this type of

505
00:20:13,129 --> 00:20:20,449
communication and unmoderated and wide

506
00:20:16,740 --> 00:20:24,899
open chat or do we have quite a broad

507
00:20:20,450 --> 00:20:27,330
range of users from children to adults

508
00:20:24,899 --> 00:20:29,850
and we don't necessarily want to be able

509
00:20:27,330 --> 00:20:31,559
to mix those particular interactions

510
00:20:29,850 --> 00:20:34,408
because it's just not appropriate or it

511
00:20:31,559 --> 00:20:37,139
opens up to abuse there's also things

512
00:20:34,409 --> 00:20:39,330
like unexpected design and one of the

513
00:20:37,139 --> 00:20:43,168
things of unexpected design is this as

514
00:20:39,330 --> 00:20:46,529
as simple as the verified by Twitter so

515
00:20:43,169 --> 00:20:48,509
essentially Twitter said all we mean by

516
00:20:46,529 --> 00:20:50,820
this little blue checkmark is that we

517
00:20:48,509 --> 00:20:53,220
verified the identity of this account

518
00:20:50,820 --> 00:20:55,740
that this account probably belongs to

519
00:20:53,220 --> 00:20:59,340
this guy named Mike because we've done

520
00:20:55,740 --> 00:21:01,169
some checks well what that created from

521
00:20:59,340 --> 00:21:03,449
and if you think of it from sorta that

522
00:21:01,169 --> 00:21:05,340
behavioral economics perspective this

523
00:21:03,450 --> 00:21:08,340
little blue check mark was something

524
00:21:05,340 --> 00:21:10,529
special and it was a scarce resource not

525
00:21:08,340 --> 00:21:12,629
everyone had done so suddenly it's a

526
00:21:10,529 --> 00:21:14,970
sign of prestige and as a sign of

527
00:21:12,629 --> 00:21:17,639
prestige it's also kind of implied as a

528
00:21:14,970 --> 00:21:19,950
sign of endorsement it doesn't matter as

529
00:21:17,639 --> 00:21:21,990
much that Twitter for example was just

530
00:21:19,950 --> 00:21:24,389
saying no this is just means what we're

531
00:21:21,990 --> 00:21:28,470
verifying that's all this means but the

532
00:21:24,389 --> 00:21:30,059
user population then came and said well

533
00:21:28,470 --> 00:21:31,320
that's what you mean but this is how

534
00:21:30,059 --> 00:21:33,658
we're using it this is how we're

535
00:21:31,320 --> 00:21:35,999
reacting to it so that's I think a great

536
00:21:33,659 --> 00:21:37,769
example of what unexpected or emergent

537
00:21:35,999 --> 00:21:41,789
design comes out of the features that

538
00:21:37,769 --> 00:21:43,980
you have and there's also an unexplored

539
00:21:41,789 --> 00:21:46,889
future of what augmented and virtual

540
00:21:43,980 --> 00:21:48,629
reality attack vectors might be so

541
00:21:46,889 --> 00:21:53,039
imagine all the abuse that we possibly

542
00:21:48,629 --> 00:21:55,830
had if you've worked in with when email

543
00:21:53,039 --> 00:21:58,080
or in photo apps or any apps that handle

544
00:21:55,830 --> 00:22:00,600
images and the idea of how the different

545
00:21:58,080 --> 00:22:02,908
types of porn or other types of abusive

546
00:22:00,600 --> 00:22:06,389
images that can come in with that static

547
00:22:02,909 --> 00:22:11,029
environment AR and VR might introduce

548
00:22:06,389 --> 00:22:13,769
whole new realms and methods of abuse

549
00:22:11,029 --> 00:22:15,539
and so it's an area that I think you

550
00:22:13,769 --> 00:22:16,620
know I'm throwing out there as an area

551
00:22:15,539 --> 00:22:19,140
to be aware of that work

552
00:22:16,620 --> 00:22:21,270
fires more investigation on my own part

553
00:22:19,140 --> 00:22:22,800
as well possibly within the industry to

554
00:22:21,270 --> 00:22:25,620
understand what those threat models

555
00:22:22,800 --> 00:22:27,659
would actually be now trying to

556
00:22:25,620 --> 00:22:30,330
highlight a couple more concrete

557
00:22:27,660 --> 00:22:32,730
examples - to try to drive this home one

558
00:22:30,330 --> 00:22:35,129
of the things is that started this

559
00:22:32,730 --> 00:22:38,540
conversation about dev SEC ops meaning

560
00:22:35,130 --> 00:22:40,710
put security within doubt working with

561
00:22:38,540 --> 00:22:43,950
development and operations that dev ops

562
00:22:40,710 --> 00:22:46,770
team if your organization has groups

563
00:22:43,950 --> 00:22:49,230
with called trust and safety or privacy

564
00:22:46,770 --> 00:22:52,410
those are also fantastic aspects and

565
00:22:49,230 --> 00:22:54,420
those are that DevOps mentality should

566
00:22:52,410 --> 00:22:56,640
and could also work with your trust and

567
00:22:54,420 --> 00:22:58,740
safety because there could be things

568
00:22:56,640 --> 00:23:01,440
that at the very least from a threat

569
00:22:58,740 --> 00:23:03,630
modeling exercise understanding how do

570
00:23:01,440 --> 00:23:05,610
ratings work within your application are

571
00:23:03,630 --> 00:23:07,980
they appropriate do they work against

572
00:23:05,610 --> 00:23:11,219
the users or can they work for them for

573
00:23:07,980 --> 00:23:14,760
example ride sharing with ride sharing

574
00:23:11,220 --> 00:23:17,790
like lyft and uber not only can you rate

575
00:23:14,760 --> 00:23:20,160
give a rating of the driver drivers can

576
00:23:17,790 --> 00:23:23,210
also rate passengers but there's

577
00:23:20,160 --> 00:23:25,620
potential abuse for this rating system

578
00:23:23,210 --> 00:23:28,770
you can might imagine how you can abuse

579
00:23:25,620 --> 00:23:31,139
it for drivers but abuse for riders

580
00:23:28,770 --> 00:23:35,970
could be something as simple as here is

581
00:23:31,140 --> 00:23:38,640
someone who has a and has an impediment

582
00:23:35,970 --> 00:23:41,370
to walking walk slower or has a mobility

583
00:23:38,640 --> 00:23:43,020
issues slower to get into cars maybe

584
00:23:41,370 --> 00:23:44,550
they'll get down rated because drivers

585
00:23:43,020 --> 00:23:46,230
are impatient don't want to work for

586
00:23:44,550 --> 00:23:47,700
that or don't want to deal with them

587
00:23:46,230 --> 00:23:51,570
because they want to try to maximize

588
00:23:47,700 --> 00:23:54,059
their cost what if the rider is a woman

589
00:23:51,570 --> 00:23:55,620
and the driver is flirting with them say

590
00:23:54,059 --> 00:23:57,059
you know where you're going you know you

591
00:23:55,620 --> 00:23:59,309
just finished a night of clubbing what's

592
00:23:57,059 --> 00:24:00,840
your number and woman finds that

593
00:23:59,309 --> 00:24:02,460
unwelcome or just doesn't want to engage

594
00:24:00,840 --> 00:24:05,309
or simply just wants to have a quiet

595
00:24:02,460 --> 00:24:07,610
ride they may get down rated simply for

596
00:24:05,309 --> 00:24:10,590
being cold or not responding to

597
00:24:07,610 --> 00:24:13,229
quote-unquote friendly flirtation or

598
00:24:10,590 --> 00:24:15,419
just somebody be nice those are small

599
00:24:13,230 --> 00:24:18,090
examples but those are still examples of

600
00:24:15,420 --> 00:24:20,610
how ratings can be abused on the grand

601
00:24:18,090 --> 00:24:22,830
picture you may try to you may argue

602
00:24:20,610 --> 00:24:24,600
that the ratings will be averaged out

603
00:24:22,830 --> 00:24:26,699
over time that if you take a lot of

604
00:24:24,600 --> 00:24:28,889
trips that doesn't matter but in that

605
00:24:26,700 --> 00:24:30,360
moment it surely doesn't feel good to

606
00:24:28,890 --> 00:24:32,070
receive that that

607
00:24:30,360 --> 00:24:34,050
feedback or that critical rating

608
00:24:32,070 --> 00:24:35,580
especially when it's and when it's a

609
00:24:34,050 --> 00:24:39,419
part of the app that's acknowledging

610
00:24:35,580 --> 00:24:42,750
that um there's also of course the ideas

611
00:24:39,420 --> 00:24:45,840
of threat modeling and privacy the gdpr

612
00:24:42,750 --> 00:24:48,030
of course since May 25th when everybody

613
00:24:45,840 --> 00:24:51,209
was getting all of their email barrage

614
00:24:48,030 --> 00:24:53,430
of updated privacy notices there's

615
00:24:51,210 --> 00:24:55,620
important aspects of not just the Oh Oz

616
00:24:53,430 --> 00:24:57,690
top ten in security controls like sequel

617
00:24:55,620 --> 00:24:59,909
injection cross-site scripting remote

618
00:24:57,690 --> 00:25:01,920
code execution but what's the data

619
00:24:59,910 --> 00:25:05,630
actually being operated on within this

620
00:25:01,920 --> 00:25:08,460
application what is the metadata of this

621
00:25:05,630 --> 00:25:10,770
early on a lot of application that we're

622
00:25:08,460 --> 00:25:12,210
dealing with photos made sure to strip

623
00:25:10,770 --> 00:25:14,430
metadata out of the photo

624
00:25:12,210 --> 00:25:17,100
especially the metadata about location

625
00:25:14,430 --> 00:25:18,900
because otherwise it was quite easy to

626
00:25:17,100 --> 00:25:21,300
see who was posting pictures and where

627
00:25:18,900 --> 00:25:23,100
those pictures coming from more recently

628
00:25:21,300 --> 00:25:27,300
we saw an interesting metadata leaks

629
00:25:23,100 --> 00:25:30,300
around Fitbit and similar similar

630
00:25:27,300 --> 00:25:33,990
devices where I believe this was a again

631
00:25:30,300 --> 00:25:37,590
in Australian it was going through some

632
00:25:33,990 --> 00:25:39,870
anonymized or and aggregated data about

633
00:25:37,590 --> 00:25:43,470
Fitbit users and was able to correlate

634
00:25:39,870 --> 00:25:45,959
them to places in the desert or places

635
00:25:43,470 --> 00:25:48,300
in remote areas that just so happened to

636
00:25:45,960 --> 00:25:50,370
coincide with the outlines of military

637
00:25:48,300 --> 00:25:53,340
bases so that was a pretty interesting

638
00:25:50,370 --> 00:25:55,949
metadata leak it wasn't a single person

639
00:25:53,340 --> 00:25:58,169
in this case saying that this is Bob or

640
00:25:55,950 --> 00:26:00,570
Sally that's running running around this

641
00:25:58,170 --> 00:26:03,540
particular base but it was an

642
00:26:00,570 --> 00:26:05,790
aggregation of all these people that was

643
00:26:03,540 --> 00:26:08,040
still a leak about here's a location

644
00:26:05,790 --> 00:26:10,220
that's actually quite sensitive as well

645
00:26:08,040 --> 00:26:13,020
as here's the times associated with that

646
00:26:10,220 --> 00:26:14,820
so again there's a lot of things to

647
00:26:13,020 --> 00:26:17,460
consider in our threat models and what

648
00:26:14,820 --> 00:26:19,169
are we actually looking at we can also

649
00:26:17,460 --> 00:26:21,060
and one of the things that I wanted to

650
00:26:19,170 --> 00:26:23,220
still emphasize is there's a lot of

651
00:26:21,060 --> 00:26:25,409
design and dev that we can still do

652
00:26:23,220 --> 00:26:29,040
within all of this effort we can still

653
00:26:25,410 --> 00:26:32,310
have dev SEC Ops so if we think of

654
00:26:29,040 --> 00:26:34,139
location data so GPS how course

655
00:26:32,310 --> 00:26:37,470
should it be do you really need

656
00:26:34,140 --> 00:26:38,670
something down to the meter or which so

657
00:26:37,470 --> 00:26:40,020
I do this for a meter because I'm

658
00:26:38,670 --> 00:26:43,020
American and I don't understand what

659
00:26:40,020 --> 00:26:44,190
meters are I apologize um but do we need

660
00:26:43,020 --> 00:26:46,200
it only down to

661
00:26:44,190 --> 00:26:48,270
what's the business purpose of our app

662
00:26:46,200 --> 00:26:51,930
that we actually need location data for

663
00:26:48,270 --> 00:26:54,270
what about where the data is stored or

664
00:26:51,930 --> 00:26:56,730
do we need the actual data or do we just

665
00:26:54,270 --> 00:26:59,070
need some binary indicator for example

666
00:26:56,730 --> 00:27:01,560
let's imagine we have an app that's just

667
00:26:59,070 --> 00:27:03,659
looking to see tracking one is when has

668
00:27:01,560 --> 00:27:05,550
someone entered this code node and when

669
00:27:03,660 --> 00:27:07,890
they enter it we can pop up an augmented

670
00:27:05,550 --> 00:27:10,260
reality or something like that that's a

671
00:27:07,890 --> 00:27:11,940
very binary question to answer that

672
00:27:10,260 --> 00:27:14,970
question we don't necessarily need to

673
00:27:11,940 --> 00:27:16,710
track on a second-by-second basis what

674
00:27:14,970 --> 00:27:19,560
are the GPS coordinates of somebody's

675
00:27:16,710 --> 00:27:22,050
phone right now it's down to the meter

676
00:27:19,560 --> 00:27:23,909
we don't need to send that data off to

677
00:27:22,050 --> 00:27:26,220
the server we just need to be able to

678
00:27:23,910 --> 00:27:28,830
compare and say is this latitude and

679
00:27:26,220 --> 00:27:31,350
longitude within what we've defined is

680
00:27:28,830 --> 00:27:33,480
this building or is it not and if all

681
00:27:31,350 --> 00:27:37,320
we're seeing from a dev Seck ops or a

682
00:27:33,480 --> 00:27:39,930
DevOps kind of approach saying just just

683
00:27:37,320 --> 00:27:42,480
track that binary indicator am i inside

684
00:27:39,930 --> 00:27:44,070
this region or outside this region then

685
00:27:42,480 --> 00:27:46,350
we're actually not collecting all of

686
00:27:44,070 --> 00:27:48,450
this potentially sensitive GPS data that

687
00:27:46,350 --> 00:27:51,750
we can track where I walked from my

688
00:27:48,450 --> 00:27:54,120
hotel past Moorgate Station finally into

689
00:27:51,750 --> 00:27:56,040
this room because that's unnecessary for

690
00:27:54,120 --> 00:28:00,659
that imagined app how that would need to

691
00:27:56,040 --> 00:28:03,210
work so one of the things I also wanted

692
00:28:00,660 --> 00:28:05,040
to call out is this idea of you know as

693
00:28:03,210 --> 00:28:06,690
I was explaining considering users

694
00:28:05,040 --> 00:28:09,210
within our threat models considering how

695
00:28:06,690 --> 00:28:10,860
the application can be abused and how

696
00:28:09,210 --> 00:28:13,980
the application can have asymmetric

697
00:28:10,860 --> 00:28:17,040
effects on users it goes back to that

698
00:28:13,980 --> 00:28:19,110
idea of are we really blaming developers

699
00:28:17,040 --> 00:28:22,590
or blaming users for mistakes they've

700
00:28:19,110 --> 00:28:27,870
made or are we failing to design them

701
00:28:22,590 --> 00:28:31,740
into our applications in 1990 I can't

702
00:28:27,870 --> 00:28:33,840
read my there's a at the bottom here but

703
00:28:31,740 --> 00:28:35,070
there's a link here to of a paper from

704
00:28:33,840 --> 00:28:38,100
Microsoft that was talking about

705
00:28:35,070 --> 00:28:41,070
ceremonies now the idea of ceremonies

706
00:28:38,100 --> 00:28:43,230
here we are two thousand seven the idea

707
00:28:41,070 --> 00:28:45,330
of ceremonies was saying that we have a

708
00:28:43,230 --> 00:28:48,390
protocols we have the ideas of protocols

709
00:28:45,330 --> 00:28:50,510
TCP is a protocol the joke about there's

710
00:28:48,390 --> 00:28:53,940
a UDP joke that no one will ever get

711
00:28:50,510 --> 00:28:56,190
think about it for a moment and but

712
00:28:53,940 --> 00:28:57,750
those are all systems and those are all

713
00:28:56,190 --> 00:28:59,270
how do systems talk to

714
00:28:57,750 --> 00:29:01,740
there how does software talk together

715
00:28:59,270 --> 00:29:05,160
with the gentleman from Microsoft did

716
00:29:01,740 --> 00:29:06,930
was say let's also model people as nodes

717
00:29:05,160 --> 00:29:08,280
within this system and we'll call these

718
00:29:06,930 --> 00:29:09,090
and set of protocols will call them

719
00:29:08,280 --> 00:29:11,730
ceremonies

720
00:29:09,090 --> 00:29:14,330
so now as within a ceremony we're going

721
00:29:11,730 --> 00:29:17,400
to start to reason how does a user

722
00:29:14,330 --> 00:29:20,010
obtain their initial password how do we

723
00:29:17,400 --> 00:29:23,640
do something like Toto foo trust on

724
00:29:20,010 --> 00:29:27,090
first use how do we distribute private

725
00:29:23,640 --> 00:29:30,000
keys for PGP how do we exchange private

726
00:29:27,090 --> 00:29:32,909
keys for PGP those rather than

727
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:34,920
hand-waving them and just saying just go

728
00:29:32,910 --> 00:29:37,860
and do this out-of-band that's what the

729
00:29:34,920 --> 00:29:39,870
protocol says what the ceremony says is

730
00:29:37,860 --> 00:29:42,449
how do we model users in this system

731
00:29:39,870 --> 00:29:45,689
what are the actions we expect them to

732
00:29:42,450 --> 00:29:48,330
take and have we hopefully designed the

733
00:29:45,690 --> 00:29:50,640
application in a way that these actions

734
00:29:48,330 --> 00:29:53,490
can be done by default in a safe manner

735
00:29:50,640 --> 00:29:56,250
or that the UX the the user experience

736
00:29:53,490 --> 00:29:58,710
is designed to encourage the correct or

737
00:29:56,250 --> 00:30:03,360
a more safe behavior or are we just

738
00:29:58,710 --> 00:30:05,430
click popping up that little certificate

739
00:30:03,360 --> 00:30:07,530
you know certificate failure error that

740
00:30:05,430 --> 00:30:08,760
says click here to continue that

741
00:30:07,530 --> 00:30:11,010
everyone is going to click here to

742
00:30:08,760 --> 00:30:13,470
continue anyway and ignore whether that

743
00:30:11,010 --> 00:30:16,140
certificate is valid so that's that idea

744
00:30:13,470 --> 00:30:18,600
of having ceremonies and modeling people

745
00:30:16,140 --> 00:30:20,070
now the caveat here of course is that

746
00:30:18,600 --> 00:30:21,689
modeling people is a little bit

747
00:30:20,070 --> 00:30:24,600
difficult and people are pretty complex

748
00:30:21,690 --> 00:30:28,350
and people are hard to predict of course

749
00:30:24,600 --> 00:30:30,360
but by elise by at least starting to

750
00:30:28,350 --> 00:30:33,060
consider them and starting to say we

751
00:30:30,360 --> 00:30:34,139
have a protocol for this for this

752
00:30:33,060 --> 00:30:36,240
application or this is how our

753
00:30:34,140 --> 00:30:38,670
application the system components of our

754
00:30:36,240 --> 00:30:41,640
application having a ceremony and

755
00:30:38,670 --> 00:30:43,620
bringing people into them is what's

756
00:30:41,640 --> 00:30:46,260
important and this comes back to that

757
00:30:43,620 --> 00:30:48,300
idea of the the one of my favorite eye

758
00:30:46,260 --> 00:30:51,060
tropes from D from role-playing games

759
00:30:48,300 --> 00:30:53,909
attacking the darkness so these would be

760
00:30:51,060 --> 00:30:55,860
threats against ceremonies that we have

761
00:30:53,910 --> 00:30:57,330
some ambiguity and design that were just

762
00:30:55,860 --> 00:31:00,240
designing a protocol and we're

763
00:30:57,330 --> 00:31:02,070
forgetting the user completely or that

764
00:31:00,240 --> 00:31:04,680
we're somewhat were assuming a uniform

765
00:31:02,070 --> 00:31:07,710
user we're assuming that this game is

766
00:31:04,680 --> 00:31:11,380
only going to be used by a certain type

767
00:31:07,710 --> 00:31:15,860
of user that likes to engage in

768
00:31:11,380 --> 00:31:18,650
quite loud quite clever quite whatever

769
00:31:15,860 --> 00:31:21,500
you know adjectives you want but smack

770
00:31:18,650 --> 00:31:24,500
talk or trash-talking within the game or

771
00:31:21,500 --> 00:31:26,810
it has that group of that population of

772
00:31:24,500 --> 00:31:28,880
users but also has another population of

773
00:31:26,810 --> 00:31:30,889
users that are young kids no

774
00:31:28,880 --> 00:31:32,240
ten-year-old kids that want to play so

775
00:31:30,890 --> 00:31:33,800
what are the different threat models

776
00:31:32,240 --> 00:31:37,730
that can be you know that our

777
00:31:33,800 --> 00:31:39,590
application is exposing them to so and

778
00:31:37,730 --> 00:31:42,260
wanted to do a couple examples of how to

779
00:31:39,590 --> 00:31:43,939
try to also say can we measure this

780
00:31:42,260 --> 00:31:45,290
because that's one the important thing

781
00:31:43,940 --> 00:31:47,240
is that we don't want to just build a

782
00:31:45,290 --> 00:31:49,159
protocol and do some linters to see our

783
00:31:47,240 --> 00:31:50,960
protocol works we want to actually have

784
00:31:49,160 --> 00:31:52,910
a ceremony and figure out is our

785
00:31:50,960 --> 00:31:56,240
ceremony working and one of the things

786
00:31:52,910 --> 00:31:57,860
we can do to hopefully measure to see if

787
00:31:56,240 --> 00:32:01,670
that's working is build a story or

788
00:31:57,860 --> 00:32:04,159
measure this a couple four things I like

789
00:32:01,670 --> 00:32:05,480
to consider and building the story is we

790
00:32:04,160 --> 00:32:07,010
want to make sure we're asking or

791
00:32:05,480 --> 00:32:09,800
starting from something that's relevant

792
00:32:07,010 --> 00:32:11,510
we wanted then because we want to make a

793
00:32:09,800 --> 00:32:13,580
decision based on it or we want this to

794
00:32:11,510 --> 00:32:16,280
say we're succeeding or we're failing

795
00:32:13,580 --> 00:32:18,020
want to gather some data we want to be

796
00:32:16,280 --> 00:32:20,090
make sure we don't have tunnel vision

797
00:32:18,020 --> 00:32:21,740
and we want to have a simple story but

798
00:32:20,090 --> 00:32:23,510
we don't want to over embellish our

799
00:32:21,740 --> 00:32:26,780
story or make up something about it that

800
00:32:23,510 --> 00:32:29,480
doesn't work so here is an example of

801
00:32:26,780 --> 00:32:32,660
metrics that I took from some data had

802
00:32:29,480 --> 00:32:34,700
access to about the average number of

803
00:32:32,660 --> 00:32:37,160
days it took to fix vulnerabilities and

804
00:32:34,700 --> 00:32:39,080
then which vulnerabilities were quicker

805
00:32:37,160 --> 00:32:41,630
to be resolved and which ones took

806
00:32:39,080 --> 00:32:45,409
longer than average so in this case

807
00:32:41,630 --> 00:32:47,320
remote code execution was was fixed in

808
00:32:45,410 --> 00:32:50,270
far fewer days than average and

809
00:32:47,320 --> 00:32:53,840
redirects and forwards took a lot longer

810
00:32:50,270 --> 00:32:56,480
than average to fix so again in the idea

811
00:32:53,840 --> 00:32:59,000
of a story this probably resonates

812
00:32:56,480 --> 00:33:01,610
pretty well if you look at the top 10

813
00:32:59,000 --> 00:33:04,700
the 2014 version had redirects and

814
00:33:01,610 --> 00:33:08,149
forwards the most recent 2017 version

815
00:33:04,700 --> 00:33:11,750
dropped it off completely and remote

816
00:33:08,150 --> 00:33:14,240
code execution has that implied high

817
00:33:11,750 --> 00:33:15,800
risk/high high-impact type of

818
00:33:14,240 --> 00:33:17,390
vulnerability so it's probably a good

819
00:33:15,800 --> 00:33:19,520
thing that people are fixing that very

820
00:33:17,390 --> 00:33:21,170
quickly but there's additional things

821
00:33:19,520 --> 00:33:23,150
that we could do to question this and

822
00:33:21,170 --> 00:33:24,380
make sure that we have good data meaning

823
00:33:23,150 --> 00:33:27,650
that we're not getting tunneled

824
00:33:24,380 --> 00:33:29,240
and just assuming our data looks good it

825
00:33:27,650 --> 00:33:31,730
could be that redirects and forwards

826
00:33:29,240 --> 00:33:34,970
rather than being low-risk may be more

827
00:33:31,730 --> 00:33:37,610
complex to fix maybe they have they

828
00:33:34,970 --> 00:33:39,410
require more Network rearch acting maybe

829
00:33:37,610 --> 00:33:41,449
they're more difficult because this is

830
00:33:39,410 --> 00:33:43,700
how a particular application is intended

831
00:33:41,450 --> 00:33:46,309
to work so that's why I just want to

832
00:33:43,700 --> 00:33:48,140
call out in the spirit of avoiding

833
00:33:46,309 --> 00:33:51,470
having too much of a narrow focus on

834
00:33:48,140 --> 00:33:53,299
metrics another type of thing too you

835
00:33:51,470 --> 00:33:57,409
know a threat to avoid on metrics is

836
00:33:53,299 --> 00:33:59,929
that idea of leaderboards so games have

837
00:33:57,409 --> 00:34:02,690
leaderboards leaderboards have many you

838
00:33:59,929 --> 00:34:04,039
know valued uses bug bounties for

839
00:34:02,690 --> 00:34:05,960
example are great examples of

840
00:34:04,039 --> 00:34:08,389
leaderboards these are individuals who

841
00:34:05,960 --> 00:34:10,730
are competing with each other to find

842
00:34:08,389 --> 00:34:13,040
the most bugs do and probably more

843
00:34:10,730 --> 00:34:15,379
interestingly get the most money off of

844
00:34:13,040 --> 00:34:17,418
those bugs in this case this is a

845
00:34:15,379 --> 00:34:18,980
leaderboard in a sense for pen testers

846
00:34:17,418 --> 00:34:21,168
because in a lot of my day-to-day work I

847
00:34:18,980 --> 00:34:23,810
work with pen testers and what I did was

848
00:34:21,168 --> 00:34:25,908
I figured out I looked at who was

849
00:34:23,810 --> 00:34:29,418
reporting findings from pen tests I

850
00:34:25,909 --> 00:34:33,500
found that 50% of the findings came from

851
00:34:29,418 --> 00:34:36,259
15% of the pen testers so if we have a

852
00:34:33,500 --> 00:34:39,159
maybe a room like this a hundred people

853
00:34:36,260 --> 00:34:42,080
in it only 15 people are doing

854
00:34:39,159 --> 00:34:43,760
supposedly half of the work but here's

855
00:34:42,080 --> 00:34:46,279
an example of metrics that are probably

856
00:34:43,760 --> 00:34:48,649
going to fail us because for possibly a

857
00:34:46,280 --> 00:34:50,510
couple reasons one a pen testing team

858
00:34:48,649 --> 00:34:52,368
typically is collaborative they're

859
00:34:50,510 --> 00:34:54,200
working towards shared goal for example

860
00:34:52,369 --> 00:34:55,580
so the person who reports the

861
00:34:54,199 --> 00:34:58,250
vulnerability may have been

862
00:34:55,580 --> 00:34:59,810
collaborating and talking with the other

863
00:34:58,250 --> 00:35:01,550
people on the team in order to figure

864
00:34:59,810 --> 00:35:04,180
out is this exploitable or what's the

865
00:35:01,550 --> 00:35:07,700
risk here the other thing is that

866
00:35:04,180 --> 00:35:09,950
findings aren't the only only measure of

867
00:35:07,700 --> 00:35:11,390
a good pen test obviously we want to

868
00:35:09,950 --> 00:35:13,970
know when there's vulnerabilities there

869
00:35:11,390 --> 00:35:15,859
but we also want to know and collect

870
00:35:13,970 --> 00:35:17,569
feedback constructive feedback about

871
00:35:15,859 --> 00:35:20,240
what is our app doing that's doing well

872
00:35:17,570 --> 00:35:23,030
is you know what's well-designed wear

873
00:35:20,240 --> 00:35:25,700
something that has that's resilient to a

874
00:35:23,030 --> 00:35:27,320
particular type of app or attack maybe

875
00:35:25,700 --> 00:35:28,879
we couldn't get all of our cross-site

876
00:35:27,320 --> 00:35:30,550
scripting exploits working because they

877
00:35:28,880 --> 00:35:32,990
had really good content security policy

878
00:35:30,550 --> 00:35:35,450
so here's an example of just working

879
00:35:32,990 --> 00:35:37,250
with people and avoiding measuring

880
00:35:35,450 --> 00:35:38,089
people on a single dimension that's

881
00:35:37,250 --> 00:35:39,680
actually not really

882
00:35:38,090 --> 00:35:41,720
active of what we want to get out of

883
00:35:39,680 --> 00:35:43,700
them in this sense we want to get out of

884
00:35:41,720 --> 00:35:45,049
our pen testers a collaborative

885
00:35:43,700 --> 00:35:46,669
atmosphere meaning that they work

886
00:35:45,050 --> 00:35:48,860
together on reporting these

887
00:35:46,670 --> 00:35:50,570
vulnerabilities and we also want to find

888
00:35:48,860 --> 00:35:52,640
out more than just what's wrong with

889
00:35:50,570 --> 00:35:55,220
this application we'd also like to know

890
00:35:52,640 --> 00:35:59,240
what's good with it so again here's this

891
00:35:55,220 --> 00:36:01,370
a couple of other examples of threats

892
00:35:59,240 --> 00:36:03,500
and the idea of threat modeling the

893
00:36:01,370 --> 00:36:05,359
metrics we collect and one of the things

894
00:36:03,500 --> 00:36:08,720
I want to call out too is cognitive

895
00:36:05,360 --> 00:36:11,300
biases so I highly encourage following

896
00:36:08,720 --> 00:36:13,339
this link to read more about different

897
00:36:11,300 --> 00:36:15,890
cognitive biases then not only affect

898
00:36:13,340 --> 00:36:17,900
the metrics we collect and how we use

899
00:36:15,890 --> 00:36:19,400
them but the different ways we interact

900
00:36:17,900 --> 00:36:21,530
with people the different ways we work

901
00:36:19,400 --> 00:36:23,090
with people because one of the things

902
00:36:21,530 --> 00:36:26,540
that I want to highlight is that what we

903
00:36:23,090 --> 00:36:28,310
measure reflects what we care about what

904
00:36:26,540 --> 00:36:30,320
we care about reflects the environment

905
00:36:28,310 --> 00:36:32,210
we're building so if we're just building

906
00:36:30,320 --> 00:36:34,190
a leaderboard of pentesters and who

907
00:36:32,210 --> 00:36:36,410
finds the most vulnerabilities we may be

908
00:36:34,190 --> 00:36:37,940
losing out on people who are working

909
00:36:36,410 --> 00:36:40,310
effectively with developers and

910
00:36:37,940 --> 00:36:42,290
explaining how to fix problems we may be

911
00:36:40,310 --> 00:36:45,020
losing out on the people who are less

912
00:36:42,290 --> 00:36:46,880
who are more collaborative and just and

913
00:36:45,020 --> 00:36:48,590
just over emphasizing people who are

914
00:36:46,880 --> 00:36:50,150
less collaborative and just want to find

915
00:36:48,590 --> 00:36:52,040
and work on their own and find

916
00:36:50,150 --> 00:36:55,460
vulnerabilities the same would be true

917
00:36:52,040 --> 00:36:57,140
of who makes the most get commits making

918
00:36:55,460 --> 00:36:59,900
the most get commits isn't necessarily

919
00:36:57,140 --> 00:37:02,060
the best developer are they do they have

920
00:36:59,900 --> 00:37:04,400
a lot of testing do they have are they

921
00:37:02,060 --> 00:37:06,710
making meaningful commits in other words

922
00:37:04,400 --> 00:37:10,010
some features may only need a few lines

923
00:37:06,710 --> 00:37:11,570
of code but maybe there's a lot of

924
00:37:10,010 --> 00:37:12,950
reasoning there's a lot of design work

925
00:37:11,570 --> 00:37:13,430
there's a lot of thinking that goes into

926
00:37:12,950 --> 00:37:14,779
it

927
00:37:13,430 --> 00:37:16,790
there's also potentially lot of

928
00:37:14,780 --> 00:37:18,680
documentation that goes into that those

929
00:37:16,790 --> 00:37:21,370
commits so that's one of those things

930
00:37:18,680 --> 00:37:25,549
that doesn't necessarily get reflected

931
00:37:21,370 --> 00:37:27,589
so wrapping up wanted to also call out

932
00:37:25,550 --> 00:37:29,630
the idea that for as much as I love

933
00:37:27,590 --> 00:37:31,610
role-playing games role-playing games I

934
00:37:29,630 --> 00:37:34,700
think are a good metaphor or a good way

935
00:37:31,610 --> 00:37:36,200
to exercises we could adopt you know

936
00:37:34,700 --> 00:37:38,960
play games with with your co-workers

937
00:37:36,200 --> 00:37:41,600
play games with your friends but they

938
00:37:38,960 --> 00:37:43,730
haven't been perfect themselves you know

939
00:37:41,600 --> 00:37:46,279
we as DevOps or we have security teams

940
00:37:43,730 --> 00:37:48,350
have our social group we at a conference

941
00:37:46,280 --> 00:37:50,210
our social group in our company we're

942
00:37:48,350 --> 00:37:51,740
social groups even just in a meeting on

943
00:37:50,210 --> 00:37:53,750
a small you know 5 to 10

944
00:37:51,740 --> 00:37:55,609
people's motion is a social group

945
00:37:53,750 --> 00:37:56,720
there's always threats to them there's

946
00:37:55,610 --> 00:37:58,940
always cliques there's always those

947
00:37:56,720 --> 00:38:01,160
ideas of gatekeeping and we have to be

948
00:37:58,940 --> 00:38:02,840
or we should be at least cognizant at

949
00:38:01,160 --> 00:38:04,520
least have the vocabulary to be able to

950
00:38:02,840 --> 00:38:06,680
call out what those types of threats

951
00:38:04,520 --> 00:38:08,690
would be and if we have a vocabulary to

952
00:38:06,680 --> 00:38:12,169
be able to identify and talk about them

953
00:38:08,690 --> 00:38:13,730
then we can recognize that maybe it's

954
00:38:12,170 --> 00:38:17,360
this is a problem or maybe this is

955
00:38:13,730 --> 00:38:20,270
something that we want to overcome so we

956
00:38:17,360 --> 00:38:22,520
can also then more concretely rather

957
00:38:20,270 --> 00:38:24,350
than plain you know go fighting some

958
00:38:22,520 --> 00:38:26,750
mind flayers and doppelgangers we could

959
00:38:24,350 --> 00:38:29,509
actually work on some tabletop exercises

960
00:38:26,750 --> 00:38:32,000
themselves so the military for example

961
00:38:29,510 --> 00:38:34,160
has done wargaming exercises for a long

962
00:38:32,000 --> 00:38:37,640
time you may have your incident

963
00:38:34,160 --> 00:38:40,069
responders within blue teams within your

964
00:38:37,640 --> 00:38:42,618
organization's may already have their

965
00:38:40,070 --> 00:38:46,240
own tabletop exercises a simple scenario

966
00:38:42,619 --> 00:38:48,230
MASINT maybe something like the

967
00:38:46,240 --> 00:38:49,819
secretaries get picked on a lot so I

968
00:38:48,230 --> 00:38:52,369
won't pick on secretaries we'll say a

969
00:38:49,820 --> 00:38:54,260
developer clicks on a fishing link and

970
00:38:52,369 --> 00:38:56,630
the developers laptop is compromised

971
00:38:54,260 --> 00:38:59,170
this is an exercise now a tabletop

972
00:38:56,630 --> 00:39:02,150
exercise for an incident response team

973
00:38:59,170 --> 00:39:04,220
or a dev ops team or a dev SEC ops team

974
00:39:02,150 --> 00:39:05,690
this might be another type of scenario

975
00:39:04,220 --> 00:39:06,830
you could come up here's a tabletop

976
00:39:05,690 --> 00:39:09,470
exercise for you

977
00:39:06,830 --> 00:39:11,930
CTO says go forth give me some better

978
00:39:09,470 --> 00:39:12,709
analytics dev ops team member says

979
00:39:11,930 --> 00:39:15,020
awesome

980
00:39:12,710 --> 00:39:16,609
I'll just export this production DB into

981
00:39:15,020 --> 00:39:18,440
this third party you know business

982
00:39:16,609 --> 00:39:20,720
intelligence tool will do a proof of

983
00:39:18,440 --> 00:39:21,920
concept for it hey everyone come check

984
00:39:20,720 --> 00:39:24,379
this out let me know what these

985
00:39:21,920 --> 00:39:26,930
dashboards look like and oops by the way

986
00:39:24,380 --> 00:39:29,510
there's some password hashes in there so

987
00:39:26,930 --> 00:39:33,500
as an exercise this potentially calls

988
00:39:29,510 --> 00:39:35,960
out a couple of problems or maybe not

989
00:39:33,500 --> 00:39:37,940
problems within your organization you

990
00:39:35,960 --> 00:39:40,580
know what does the chain of command or

991
00:39:37,940 --> 00:39:42,980
the the decision-making effort look like

992
00:39:40,580 --> 00:39:45,410
this how about moving production data

993
00:39:42,980 --> 00:39:47,390
into a third party you know having

994
00:39:45,410 --> 00:39:49,310
password hashes that are moved out there

995
00:39:47,390 --> 00:39:52,009
as well there's a lot of conversations

996
00:39:49,310 --> 00:39:54,259
that can come out of this and as a dev

997
00:39:52,010 --> 00:39:56,900
sec ops you can you know bring people

998
00:39:54,260 --> 00:39:59,180
together to do this you can create some

999
00:39:56,900 --> 00:40:01,430
relevant scenarios go and attack the

1000
00:39:59,180 --> 00:40:03,589
objective of that scenario rather than

1001
00:40:01,430 --> 00:40:05,359
the scenario itself rather than saying

1002
00:40:03,590 --> 00:40:08,330
my CTO knows better

1003
00:40:05,360 --> 00:40:10,850
run with it what if the CTO did this do

1004
00:40:08,330 --> 00:40:12,529
we have conversations you have things in

1005
00:40:10,850 --> 00:40:15,500
place to be able to handle this to be

1006
00:40:12,530 --> 00:40:17,690
able to react to it and collect feedback

1007
00:40:15,500 --> 00:40:19,160
on those ceremonies on the people and

1008
00:40:17,690 --> 00:40:21,410
processes you have within your

1009
00:40:19,160 --> 00:40:22,819
organization as well as get feedback on

1010
00:40:21,410 --> 00:40:25,520
how you're running these tabletop

1011
00:40:22,820 --> 00:40:27,980
exercises your IR team probably has done

1012
00:40:25,520 --> 00:40:29,930
a lot of these have the dev ops team go

1013
00:40:27,980 --> 00:40:33,800
through this these tabletop eps or

1014
00:40:29,930 --> 00:40:38,240
exercises are essentially larger more

1015
00:40:33,800 --> 00:40:40,190
grandiose threat models so as we wind

1016
00:40:38,240 --> 00:40:42,169
down to the last few seconds I had to

1017
00:40:40,190 --> 00:40:44,810
throw in my final joke what was the

1018
00:40:42,170 --> 00:40:46,130
emphasis about what this the whole

1019
00:40:44,810 --> 00:40:48,910
presentation was about is that

1020
00:40:46,130 --> 00:40:52,010
applications are made by people

1021
00:40:48,910 --> 00:40:53,810
applications are made for people and in

1022
00:40:52,010 --> 00:40:56,720
a way yes applications are made of

1023
00:40:53,810 --> 00:40:57,710
people now one final quotient want to

1024
00:40:56,720 --> 00:40:59,810
leave you with there is a famous

1025
00:40:57,710 --> 00:41:02,120
Englishman who embodied the spirit of

1026
00:40:59,810 --> 00:41:05,150
live-action role-playing and as he once

1027
00:41:02,120 --> 00:41:08,089
said we could be heroes just for one day

1028
00:41:05,150 --> 00:41:09,920
so let's try to make that day lasts a

1029
00:41:08,090 --> 00:41:11,830
long time play some games and have fun

1030
00:41:09,920 --> 00:41:17,510
thank you

1031
00:41:11,830 --> 00:41:20,310
[Applause]

1032
00:41:17,510 --> 00:41:22,050
now I realize I talked all the way up

1033
00:41:20,310 --> 00:41:23,549
because I want to avoid questions which

1034
00:41:22,050 --> 00:41:25,530
actually isn't true I talked all the way

1035
00:41:23,550 --> 00:41:27,150
up because I had a lot of slides I'm not

1036
00:41:25,530 --> 00:41:29,250
sure if we have time for questions or

1037
00:41:27,150 --> 00:41:31,170
we'll have to run away I haven't been

1038
00:41:29,250 --> 00:41:37,800
waved off yet so we will I will take a

1039
00:41:31,170 --> 00:41:44,550
drink while we go find questions any

1040
00:41:37,800 --> 00:41:47,130
questions any questions questions well

1041
00:41:44,550 --> 00:41:52,889
thanks very much Mike thank you everyone

1042
00:41:47,130 --> 00:41:52,889
