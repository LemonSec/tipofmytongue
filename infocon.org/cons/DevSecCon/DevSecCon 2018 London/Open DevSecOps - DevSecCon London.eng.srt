1
00:00:02,540 --> 00:00:11,969
okay so we've got some test lights first

2
00:00:07,730 --> 00:00:14,870
good I'm gonna start with this Carl

3
00:00:11,969 --> 00:00:17,750
Sagan one of the most enigmatic

4
00:00:14,870 --> 00:00:20,220
astronomers astrophysicist

5
00:00:17,750 --> 00:00:22,769
astrobiologists has once said that you

6
00:00:20,220 --> 00:00:25,500
have to know the past in order to

7
00:00:22,769 --> 00:00:27,060
understand the present and when I was

8
00:00:25,500 --> 00:00:29,039
writing the slides for this talk I

9
00:00:27,060 --> 00:00:30,810
realized that obviously the kind of

10
00:00:29,039 --> 00:00:32,189
stuff I'm gonna talk about it were

11
00:00:30,810 --> 00:00:35,370
really really hard for the people to

12
00:00:32,189 --> 00:00:38,910
resonate with because they certainly

13
00:00:35,370 --> 00:00:41,730
don't have my experience I mean not that

14
00:00:38,910 --> 00:00:44,489
I have such a amazing experience and

15
00:00:41,730 --> 00:00:46,019
I've had like amazing bringing but it's

16
00:00:44,489 --> 00:00:49,288
certainly very different what most

17
00:00:46,020 --> 00:00:51,449
people would have and I decided to share

18
00:00:49,289 --> 00:00:53,579
this in the first couple of slides and

19
00:00:51,449 --> 00:00:56,070
then go back into the main the main

20
00:00:53,579 --> 00:00:59,430
topic and so since I'm in control of

21
00:00:56,070 --> 00:01:01,710
this presentation I want to reverse back

22
00:00:59,430 --> 00:01:06,600
time and in fact I want to reverse it as

23
00:01:01,710 --> 00:01:09,570
much as 1995 and 1995 was actually quite

24
00:01:06,600 --> 00:01:12,720
amazing year not only in terms of pop

25
00:01:09,570 --> 00:01:17,070
culture obviously we have a lot of great

26
00:01:12,720 --> 00:01:18,630
songs a lot of great movies of course

27
00:01:17,070 --> 00:01:20,758
one of the most epic software releases

28
00:01:18,630 --> 00:01:23,850
windows 95 everybody will remember that

29
00:01:20,759 --> 00:01:25,560
and I didn't know up until I was writing

30
00:01:23,850 --> 00:01:28,110
the slides but actually kevin Mitnick

31
00:01:25,560 --> 00:01:33,500
was caught in 1995 so it was pretty

32
00:01:28,110 --> 00:01:38,850
pretty eventful year but for me 1995 was

33
00:01:33,500 --> 00:01:40,049
amazing because of these guys and the

34
00:01:38,850 --> 00:01:42,149
reason I mentioned these guys is because

35
00:01:40,049 --> 00:01:45,920
funny enough this is what got me into

36
00:01:42,150 --> 00:01:48,720
security so I run to the VHS store I

37
00:01:45,920 --> 00:01:49,979
found the movie hackers my dad actually

38
00:01:48,720 --> 00:01:52,048
sent me to get a completely different

39
00:01:49,979 --> 00:01:56,340
movie but at that point I was in

40
00:01:52,049 --> 00:01:58,079
wrestling and allegedly hackers and I as

41
00:01:56,340 --> 00:02:00,479
soon as I saw the movie I realized this

42
00:01:58,079 --> 00:02:01,949
is what I want to do for the rest of my

43
00:02:00,479 --> 00:02:03,600
life obviously at that point I didn't

44
00:02:01,950 --> 00:02:07,770
know that I can actually profit from it

45
00:02:03,600 --> 00:02:10,709
and and in fact even use it for you know

46
00:02:07,770 --> 00:02:12,629
as a means to to actually

47
00:02:10,709 --> 00:02:15,090
you know cater for my family and that

48
00:02:12,629 --> 00:02:16,798
kind of stuff so basically in those days

49
00:02:15,090 --> 00:02:19,769
were very very different so when I was

50
00:02:16,799 --> 00:02:22,680
growing up in this hacking seen on the

51
00:02:19,769 --> 00:02:24,420
hacking community one thing that I think

52
00:02:22,680 --> 00:02:26,849
that a lot of people forget about is

53
00:02:24,420 --> 00:02:28,920
that the hacking scene was actually

54
00:02:26,849 --> 00:02:31,798
about three things generally speaking

55
00:02:28,920 --> 00:02:33,328
and the first one is knowledge now I

56
00:02:31,799 --> 00:02:35,099
know that a lot of people look at the

57
00:02:33,329 --> 00:02:37,709
moving hacker stand and think well this

58
00:02:35,099 --> 00:02:40,170
is a bit of BS because you know it's not

59
00:02:37,709 --> 00:02:42,090
it's not that's not how software works

60
00:02:40,170 --> 00:02:43,708
but I think that from a cultural

61
00:02:42,090 --> 00:02:45,540
perspective hackers was actually quite

62
00:02:43,709 --> 00:02:47,340
nailed it down so the first one is

63
00:02:45,540 --> 00:02:51,150
actually about knowledge now in this

64
00:02:47,340 --> 00:02:53,250
scene here we see I think the Phantom

65
00:02:51,150 --> 00:02:55,560
freak something like that

66
00:02:53,250 --> 00:02:57,569
talking to 0qu about some books that he

67
00:02:55,560 --> 00:03:00,209
got from the library like compiler

68
00:02:57,569 --> 00:03:02,089
design and dragon book you know really

69
00:03:00,209 --> 00:03:05,940
really old school computer science books

70
00:03:02,090 --> 00:03:08,159
and it was all about basically getting

71
00:03:05,940 --> 00:03:09,510
knowledge in these days and it had to be

72
00:03:08,159 --> 00:03:12,929
actually passionate he wanted to know

73
00:03:09,510 --> 00:03:16,310
everything about everything the second

74
00:03:12,930 --> 00:03:19,169
main thing was actually prestige and

75
00:03:16,310 --> 00:03:20,780
again this is something that in 2018

76
00:03:19,169 --> 00:03:23,160
we'd actually talk about too much but

77
00:03:20,780 --> 00:03:25,560
the fact of the matter is that in those

78
00:03:23,160 --> 00:03:27,299
days it was very very difficult to

79
00:03:25,560 --> 00:03:29,250
monetize your security skills I mean

80
00:03:27,299 --> 00:03:31,769
unless you go on the you know like a

81
00:03:29,250 --> 00:03:33,389
black hat or something but even then it

82
00:03:31,769 --> 00:03:35,760
was not so easy to actually make money

83
00:03:33,389 --> 00:03:38,069
out of this stuff and so the only way

84
00:03:35,760 --> 00:03:40,948
the only reward you'll get back was in

85
00:03:38,069 --> 00:03:43,649
fact you know the acceptance from the

86
00:03:40,949 --> 00:03:45,150
community you know the community you

87
00:03:43,650 --> 00:03:46,919
know the appreciation of your skills

88
00:03:45,150 --> 00:03:49,769
from your your friends and the people

89
00:03:46,919 --> 00:03:51,840
that you hang out with and last but not

90
00:03:49,769 --> 00:03:54,989
least it was all about the community

91
00:03:51,840 --> 00:03:56,699
itself so basically this is this is when

92
00:03:54,989 --> 00:03:59,549
we started we started getting these

93
00:03:56,699 --> 00:04:03,060
conferences like DEFCON and and blackhat

94
00:03:59,549 --> 00:04:05,940
coming up you know originally very very

95
00:04:03,060 --> 00:04:08,010
small obviously open DEFCON is a good

96
00:04:05,940 --> 00:04:10,290
example small conference right now it's

97
00:04:08,010 --> 00:04:13,560
actually quite big and so access to this

98
00:04:10,290 --> 00:04:16,349
community really really mattered so as

99
00:04:13,560 --> 00:04:20,310
soon as this is for me is the Romantic

100
00:04:16,349 --> 00:04:22,289
Age of the hacking scene because very

101
00:04:20,310 --> 00:04:24,360
very quickly after that as soon as I got

102
00:04:22,289 --> 00:04:24,820
into London I got into the information

103
00:04:24,360 --> 00:04:26,740
secure

104
00:04:24,820 --> 00:04:28,330
Sene I started actually working as a

105
00:04:26,740 --> 00:04:32,140
penetration tester for a few companies

106
00:04:28,330 --> 00:04:36,520
and and in-house security teams and from

107
00:04:32,140 --> 00:04:38,349
my perspective we have about four

108
00:04:36,520 --> 00:04:40,330
different milestones in the security

109
00:04:38,350 --> 00:04:44,230
space that I have personally experienced

110
00:04:40,330 --> 00:04:47,289
now obviously this is very biased you

111
00:04:44,230 --> 00:04:49,480
know I put these slides but the way I

112
00:04:47,290 --> 00:04:51,160
said is that we started with pen testing

113
00:04:49,480 --> 00:04:52,840
which was actually quite a big milestone

114
00:04:51,160 --> 00:04:54,130
and a lot of people were involved in the

115
00:04:52,840 --> 00:04:57,159
pen testing industry in fact when I

116
00:04:54,130 --> 00:05:00,040
joined the pen testing industry it was

117
00:04:57,160 --> 00:05:01,930
kind of a pretty big and then we have

118
00:05:00,040 --> 00:05:04,240
vulnerability progress bug bounties and

119
00:05:01,930 --> 00:05:05,920
and these days and H we are talking

120
00:05:04,240 --> 00:05:07,870
about this sort of synergetic

121
00:05:05,920 --> 00:05:14,110
relationship with development and

122
00:05:07,870 --> 00:05:16,240
security and so pen testing oh sorry I

123
00:05:14,110 --> 00:05:17,980
wanted to mention funny enough of course

124
00:05:16,240 --> 00:05:19,330
that works in my favor but it almost

125
00:05:17,980 --> 00:05:22,780
seems that they actually five years

126
00:05:19,330 --> 00:05:25,450
apart now I know they're say cops it's

127
00:05:22,780 --> 00:05:27,700
not really like made you know inventing

128
00:05:25,450 --> 00:05:30,969
2018 but it seems to me that we had to

129
00:05:27,700 --> 00:05:32,440
pick here so almost as if there is a

130
00:05:30,970 --> 00:05:36,070
some sort of a sign if you believe in

131
00:05:32,440 --> 00:05:39,880
that kind of stuff so pen testing and

132
00:05:36,070 --> 00:05:41,380
red teams I just wanted to cover this

133
00:05:39,880 --> 00:05:45,730
very very quickly

134
00:05:41,380 --> 00:05:47,440
basically these days in age we talk

135
00:05:45,730 --> 00:05:49,240
about red teams as if something

136
00:05:47,440 --> 00:05:51,550
something completely new I mean this is

137
00:05:49,240 --> 00:05:55,300
basically another way to repackage an

138
00:05:51,550 --> 00:05:57,220
old product you know red team's existed

139
00:05:55,300 --> 00:06:00,520
since the dawn of pen testing and in

140
00:05:57,220 --> 00:06:03,490
fact when I when I joined a company mind

141
00:06:00,520 --> 00:06:05,919
you in Rochester security company that

142
00:06:03,490 --> 00:06:07,630
delivers penetration tests I felt I was

143
00:06:05,920 --> 00:06:09,670
part of a red team because we had people

144
00:06:07,630 --> 00:06:11,290
they were doing all kinds of different

145
00:06:09,670 --> 00:06:12,760
stuff you know from social engineering

146
00:06:11,290 --> 00:06:15,490
we had a guy who was working in the

147
00:06:12,760 --> 00:06:17,170
physical side of things you know we had

148
00:06:15,490 --> 00:06:20,250
people who were developers and so on and

149
00:06:17,170 --> 00:06:22,960
so it was actually a real real red team

150
00:06:20,250 --> 00:06:27,460
and of course we know what pen testers

151
00:06:22,960 --> 00:06:29,530
are about you know but this was this to

152
00:06:27,460 --> 00:06:32,349
me at this day and age although pen

153
00:06:29,530 --> 00:06:35,049
testing red teams are still used as a as

154
00:06:32,350 --> 00:06:36,849
a function of security I believe that

155
00:06:35,050 --> 00:06:40,629
they are less relevant and

156
00:06:36,849 --> 00:06:43,839
covered this in a second the next key

157
00:06:40,629 --> 00:06:46,839
milestone is the so called vulnerability

158
00:06:43,839 --> 00:06:51,209
acquisition programs and so for me that

159
00:06:46,839 --> 00:06:53,860
experience started about 2005 2006 and

160
00:06:51,209 --> 00:06:57,219
the zero day initiative in fact was

161
00:06:53,860 --> 00:06:59,610
actually created in 2007 and poem to own

162
00:06:57,219 --> 00:07:04,990
competition quickly followed after that

163
00:06:59,610 --> 00:07:07,509
and so and so the purpose of these

164
00:07:04,990 --> 00:07:09,610
programs really is that you know people

165
00:07:07,509 --> 00:07:12,459
realize that hang on I mean pen testing

166
00:07:09,610 --> 00:07:14,529
is great and red teams are great of

167
00:07:12,459 --> 00:07:15,969
course we have this sort of security

168
00:07:14,529 --> 00:07:18,039
industry going on that does this sort of

169
00:07:15,969 --> 00:07:19,269
services but the bottom line is that

170
00:07:18,039 --> 00:07:20,529
there are a lot of vulnerabilities out

171
00:07:19,269 --> 00:07:21,879
there and the bottom line is there's a

172
00:07:20,529 --> 00:07:24,550
lot of people who actually have access

173
00:07:21,879 --> 00:07:26,050
to information and what we want to do we

174
00:07:24,550 --> 00:07:27,789
want to acquire that information from

175
00:07:26,050 --> 00:07:30,580
them and of course we pay the money for

176
00:07:27,789 --> 00:07:35,080
that one thing that is quite interesting

177
00:07:30,580 --> 00:07:36,369
is that if you look at for example you

178
00:07:35,080 --> 00:07:39,008
know the cost of acquisition of

179
00:07:36,369 --> 00:07:40,599
vulnerabilities between 2005 to 2018

180
00:07:39,009 --> 00:07:43,719
there is there is actually quite a

181
00:07:40,599 --> 00:07:46,079
drastic difference now back in the days

182
00:07:43,719 --> 00:07:48,490
when I was a penetration tester

183
00:07:46,079 --> 00:07:50,279
vulnerabilities and I'm gonna refer back

184
00:07:48,490 --> 00:07:51,879
to this this point about Bristish

185
00:07:50,279 --> 00:07:54,789
vulnerabilities and vulnerability

186
00:07:51,879 --> 00:07:57,129
disclosure was nothing but essentially

187
00:07:54,789 --> 00:07:58,509
means to attract more customers because

188
00:07:57,129 --> 00:08:00,339
you know you can show that actually can

189
00:07:58,509 --> 00:08:01,930
do these things and since you can't

190
00:08:00,339 --> 00:08:03,009
monetize directly from the vulnerability

191
00:08:01,930 --> 00:08:04,689
that you're finding of course you're

192
00:08:03,009 --> 00:08:07,809
doing you know you're making the world

193
00:08:04,689 --> 00:08:08,919
better place and all that but the fact

194
00:08:07,809 --> 00:08:10,300
of the matter is that you use the

195
00:08:08,919 --> 00:08:11,709
vulnerability as means to attract

196
00:08:10,300 --> 00:08:13,329
customers you know and you block about

197
00:08:11,709 --> 00:08:15,129
them and go to conferences talk about

198
00:08:13,329 --> 00:08:17,469
them and so as soon as this

199
00:08:15,129 --> 00:08:20,409
vulnerability position programs came out

200
00:08:17,469 --> 00:08:21,639
I mean the top prices I mean obviously

201
00:08:20,409 --> 00:08:23,498
I'm not talking about the black market

202
00:08:21,639 --> 00:08:25,379
and I can show you a lot of interesting

203
00:08:23,499 --> 00:08:28,539
stories after this talk about this but

204
00:08:25,379 --> 00:08:30,749
you know funny funny approaches on the

205
00:08:28,539 --> 00:08:33,399
internet but the thing is this is that

206
00:08:30,749 --> 00:08:35,740
what potentially and again this is

207
00:08:33,399 --> 00:08:37,448
actually something maybe I'll be

208
00:08:35,740 --> 00:08:38,860
completely misrepresenting the situation

209
00:08:37,448 --> 00:08:40,508
but as far as I remember something that

210
00:08:38,860 --> 00:08:43,089
would have costed like ten thousand

211
00:08:40,509 --> 00:08:44,680
dollars in 2005 for remote code

212
00:08:43,089 --> 00:08:46,449
execution vulnerability in Windows I

213
00:08:44,680 --> 00:08:48,849
mean this was actually an official

214
00:08:46,449 --> 00:08:50,199
position program this days and H will

215
00:08:48,850 --> 00:08:51,820
cost at least half a million

216
00:08:50,200 --> 00:08:59,860
for the same vulnerability so it's an

217
00:08:51,820 --> 00:09:03,430
order of magnitude more and the next

218
00:08:59,860 --> 00:09:07,000
thing the next milestone is is the the

219
00:09:03,430 --> 00:09:10,959
whole you know existence of this the the

220
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:14,709
the the the initiation of this but you

221
00:09:10,959 --> 00:09:17,349
know public or crowd-sourced penetration

222
00:09:14,709 --> 00:09:19,359
testing services but crowd and hacker

223
00:09:17,350 --> 00:09:21,190
one which came a little bit later after

224
00:09:19,360 --> 00:09:23,579
background but basically they came

225
00:09:21,190 --> 00:09:26,800
around 2012 I believe but crowd actually

226
00:09:23,579 --> 00:09:29,979
was formed as a company in 2012 and the

227
00:09:26,800 --> 00:09:33,339
whole point of this vulnerability

228
00:09:29,980 --> 00:09:36,790
programs if you like is that clients who

229
00:09:33,339 --> 00:09:38,800
are already ready to to you know and

230
00:09:36,790 --> 00:09:40,689
they were okay for people to test their

231
00:09:38,800 --> 00:09:42,490
public systems they will participate in

232
00:09:40,690 --> 00:09:45,459
these programs and essentially now you

233
00:09:42,490 --> 00:09:47,290
can crowdsource the whole world and they

234
00:09:45,459 --> 00:09:49,268
can test your systems and obviously

235
00:09:47,290 --> 00:09:51,579
because of that you you're you know

236
00:09:49,269 --> 00:09:53,709
instead of paying for a single team to

237
00:09:51,579 --> 00:09:53,920
do the pen test you can get like I don't

238
00:09:53,709 --> 00:09:55,689
know

239
00:09:53,920 --> 00:09:58,300
Tenzing you know 10 teams to actually do

240
00:09:55,690 --> 00:10:01,690
the pen test for you and and as a result

241
00:09:58,300 --> 00:10:04,000
that I get more benefit again I want to

242
00:10:01,690 --> 00:10:07,480
talk about price because this is I think

243
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:09,390
it's important the interesting thing is

244
00:10:07,480 --> 00:10:11,440
about this vulnerability programs that

245
00:10:09,390 --> 00:10:14,019
many of you probably don't realize

246
00:10:11,440 --> 00:10:15,940
actually how profitable they can be for

247
00:10:14,019 --> 00:10:16,839
some penetration testers or some people

248
00:10:15,940 --> 00:10:19,000
who are in these programs

249
00:10:16,839 --> 00:10:21,310
I actually know people who are literally

250
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:22,750
milliner's doing this sort of stuff but

251
00:10:21,310 --> 00:10:25,660
the thing is that you would expect a

252
00:10:22,750 --> 00:10:27,430
some of these programs to actually pay

253
00:10:25,660 --> 00:10:28,719
from ten thousands a hundred thousand

254
00:10:27,430 --> 00:10:31,989
depending on the exploit that you're

255
00:10:28,720 --> 00:10:33,760
actually giving away funny enough when

256
00:10:31,990 --> 00:10:36,640
Facebook was hacked actually several

257
00:10:33,760 --> 00:10:38,290
weeks ago I was wondering do you know

258
00:10:36,640 --> 00:10:39,819
what they could have probably got quite

259
00:10:38,290 --> 00:10:41,199
a bit of money from this evening went

260
00:10:39,819 --> 00:10:43,300
straight to Facebook I said you know

261
00:10:41,199 --> 00:10:45,640
we've got a way to extract that data I

262
00:10:43,300 --> 00:10:48,189
mean probably that would be more than

263
00:10:45,640 --> 00:10:49,689
what Facebook was you know officially

264
00:10:48,190 --> 00:10:52,569
giving probably like three or four times

265
00:10:49,690 --> 00:10:54,459
that maybe even know more just to cover

266
00:10:52,569 --> 00:10:56,589
it up but you know they realize that

267
00:10:54,459 --> 00:10:57,969
money you know probably you can imagine

268
00:10:56,589 --> 00:11:00,220
that if you're at that point money is

269
00:10:57,970 --> 00:11:01,750
nothing you can actually use it for

270
00:11:00,220 --> 00:11:03,029
other purposes rather than actually

271
00:11:01,750 --> 00:11:04,500
getting paid

272
00:11:03,029 --> 00:11:06,810
the other thing that I want to mention

273
00:11:04,500 --> 00:11:08,879
about this is that when I got into the

274
00:11:06,810 --> 00:11:10,170
security seen for example

275
00:11:08,879 --> 00:11:11,459
vulnerabilities like cross-site

276
00:11:10,170 --> 00:11:13,378
scripting which a lot of people would

277
00:11:11,459 --> 00:11:15,060
think okay they were you know the worst

278
00:11:13,379 --> 00:11:16,410
basically and everybody who's sharing

279
00:11:15,060 --> 00:11:18,839
that sort of stuff were basically

280
00:11:16,410 --> 00:11:20,370
worthless you know now these days

281
00:11:18,839 --> 00:11:22,980
actually get paid quite a bit of money

282
00:11:20,370 --> 00:11:28,129
for the same type vulnerabilities and

283
00:11:22,980 --> 00:11:30,149
here we are in the Deaf tech ops phase

284
00:11:28,129 --> 00:11:31,769
which is all about continuous

285
00:11:30,149 --> 00:11:33,199
integration continuous delivery which I

286
00:11:31,769 --> 00:11:35,220
believe is also another milestone

287
00:11:33,199 --> 00:11:36,719
essentially trying to solve the exact

288
00:11:35,220 --> 00:11:39,029
same problems that all of these other

289
00:11:36,720 --> 00:11:42,149
things have tried to soften in their own

290
00:11:39,029 --> 00:11:43,500
way but now we are basically you know

291
00:11:42,149 --> 00:11:45,000
this this move will shift to the left

292
00:11:43,500 --> 00:11:47,639
we're trying to actually solve this

293
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:51,000
issue by by embedding processes within

294
00:11:47,639 --> 00:11:53,220
you know the how we deliver software and

295
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:55,439
this is an example of a software

296
00:11:53,220 --> 00:11:57,029
delivery pipeline I mean I understand

297
00:11:55,439 --> 00:11:58,949
that this is not a complete one so don't

298
00:11:57,029 --> 00:12:00,540
judge me on this but this is just for

299
00:11:58,949 --> 00:12:02,790
illustration purposes the way they're

300
00:12:00,540 --> 00:12:05,160
set cops works is that you have that

301
00:12:02,790 --> 00:12:06,569
pipeline you put some stuff in it maybe

302
00:12:05,160 --> 00:12:08,610
at the testing phase or at the

303
00:12:06,569 --> 00:12:09,839
monitoring face or a deploy phase and

304
00:12:08,610 --> 00:12:11,370
essentially call it today

305
00:12:09,839 --> 00:12:13,949
you know now it can deploy 60 times a

306
00:12:11,370 --> 00:12:16,170
day without touching base with the

307
00:12:13,949 --> 00:12:17,579
security team so what's the point of the

308
00:12:16,170 --> 00:12:22,110
hold this

309
00:12:17,579 --> 00:12:23,969
well it's boy it's been always about

310
00:12:22,110 --> 00:12:26,639
this true group of people I mean it's

311
00:12:23,970 --> 00:12:28,680
always been about the group you know

312
00:12:26,639 --> 00:12:31,230
that about hackers and the developers or

313
00:12:28,680 --> 00:12:34,349
like you know the offensive team and the

314
00:12:31,230 --> 00:12:35,879
defensive team and from my experience

315
00:12:34,350 --> 00:12:38,579
I've actually sat in both sides of the

316
00:12:35,879 --> 00:12:40,319
defense so you know you see the world

317
00:12:38,579 --> 00:12:41,729
very very differently as being from the

318
00:12:40,319 --> 00:12:45,089
offensive side and actually the way he

319
00:12:41,730 --> 00:12:46,589
said from the defensive side and what I

320
00:12:45,089 --> 00:12:48,569
wanted to say is that we're kind of at a

321
00:12:46,589 --> 00:12:50,670
big point I mean somewhere over there

322
00:12:48,569 --> 00:12:53,969
where we've tried all these other new

323
00:12:50,670 --> 00:12:55,469
approaches but somehow they didn't work

324
00:12:53,970 --> 00:12:57,180
so right now we're talking about this

325
00:12:55,470 --> 00:13:02,009
convert you know this converges this

326
00:12:57,180 --> 00:13:04,680
thing called def psych ops so I had the

327
00:13:02,009 --> 00:13:06,809
opportunity for the past six months to

328
00:13:04,680 --> 00:13:08,910
work with some brilliant back-end

329
00:13:06,809 --> 00:13:10,920
engineers and although I knew about def

330
00:13:08,910 --> 00:13:13,380
psych ops from the very very beginning

331
00:13:10,920 --> 00:13:14,880
as Francois mentioned it didn't actually

332
00:13:13,380 --> 00:13:16,200
occur to me

333
00:13:14,880 --> 00:13:18,000
the potential

334
00:13:16,200 --> 00:13:20,400
of that model up until recently and

335
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:22,920
that's why I believe from someone like

336
00:13:20,400 --> 00:13:24,780
me who have spent most of their time on

337
00:13:22,920 --> 00:13:26,849
the offensive side of things it was

338
00:13:24,780 --> 00:13:29,130
almost like a breakthrough idea I mean

339
00:13:26,850 --> 00:13:30,810
almost like a breakthrough awakening and

340
00:13:29,130 --> 00:13:32,850
I realize hang on this is something

341
00:13:30,810 --> 00:13:34,380
quite important this is a milestone and

342
00:13:32,850 --> 00:13:36,180
we need to actually prepare ourselves to

343
00:13:34,380 --> 00:13:38,010
actually do better in the next at least

344
00:13:36,180 --> 00:13:40,620
five years until we hit the next like of

345
00:13:38,010 --> 00:13:42,360
something new and so because of that I

346
00:13:40,620 --> 00:13:45,990
started this project called open there's

347
00:13:42,360 --> 00:13:47,370
egg cops and bluntly putting open back

348
00:13:45,990 --> 00:13:49,590
into the dead sack of tomorrow has never

349
00:13:47,370 --> 00:13:51,030
been closed but you know if you can come

350
00:13:49,590 --> 00:13:55,200
up with a better subtitle you know

351
00:13:51,030 --> 00:13:57,000
please let me know so why did I start

352
00:13:55,200 --> 00:14:00,360
this project well if you come back to

353
00:13:57,000 --> 00:14:02,400
the continuous integration pipeline or

354
00:14:00,360 --> 00:14:03,900
continuous delivery pipeline we have

355
00:14:02,400 --> 00:14:06,120
this sort of checkpoints where we can

356
00:14:03,900 --> 00:14:09,630
insert security gates but the actual

357
00:14:06,120 --> 00:14:11,670
problem is is that what do we put in

358
00:14:09,630 --> 00:14:13,830
there you know and and it's really easy

359
00:14:11,670 --> 00:14:15,599
to explain what deaths a cops looks like

360
00:14:13,830 --> 00:14:17,280
it's very easy to explain what the

361
00:14:15,600 --> 00:14:19,500
secure development lifecycle looks like

362
00:14:17,280 --> 00:14:21,480
but when it comes down to implementation

363
00:14:19,500 --> 00:14:24,360
I believe that a lot of people get stuck

364
00:14:21,480 --> 00:14:26,850
because they say stuff like well we want

365
00:14:24,360 --> 00:14:28,200
to inject some developer friendly tools

366
00:14:26,850 --> 00:14:30,960
maybe we want to do static source

367
00:14:28,200 --> 00:14:32,790
analyzer you know we can do you know

368
00:14:30,960 --> 00:14:34,320
dynamic application scanners that kind

369
00:14:32,790 --> 00:14:36,000
of stuff I mean there is nothing new

370
00:14:34,320 --> 00:14:38,490
about this stuff this stuff existed for

371
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:40,050
many many years and they not necessarily

372
00:14:38,490 --> 00:14:41,820
need to be part of your pipeline unless

373
00:14:40,050 --> 00:14:46,560
you're pushing to production 60 times a

374
00:14:41,820 --> 00:14:48,690
day so the other thing which is quite

375
00:14:46,560 --> 00:14:50,459
fundamental that we need to we need to

376
00:14:48,690 --> 00:14:53,850
understand not not just like what we're

377
00:14:50,460 --> 00:14:55,560
going to put in those particular

378
00:14:53,850 --> 00:14:58,380
checkpoints but the other thing that we

379
00:14:55,560 --> 00:15:01,280
need to understand is that if a

380
00:14:58,380 --> 00:15:04,650
structure is also code these days and so

381
00:15:01,280 --> 00:15:06,240
I mean we know I mean I know that

382
00:15:04,650 --> 00:15:08,160
there's a lot of organizations I heard

383
00:15:06,240 --> 00:15:09,690
this morning you know in banking world

384
00:15:08,160 --> 00:15:13,140
moves back to virtual machines which is

385
00:15:09,690 --> 00:15:14,700
great you know or physical boxes but the

386
00:15:13,140 --> 00:15:15,870
thing is that we have access to this

387
00:15:14,700 --> 00:15:18,390
thing called the cloud and the cloud

388
00:15:15,870 --> 00:15:20,550
actually in the face of AWS and and

389
00:15:18,390 --> 00:15:22,439
Google it's quite sophisticated so we

390
00:15:20,550 --> 00:15:24,390
can build very very complex

391
00:15:22,440 --> 00:15:26,400
infrastructure so very very complex

392
00:15:24,390 --> 00:15:27,960
applications which were literally

393
00:15:26,400 --> 00:15:29,819
impossible to do

394
00:15:27,960 --> 00:15:32,120
especially pulled out by a very small

395
00:15:29,820 --> 00:15:34,830
team single-handedly like ten years ago

396
00:15:32,120 --> 00:15:36,510
and we have a lot of supporting tools to

397
00:15:34,830 --> 00:15:39,000
actually allow us to do that we have

398
00:15:36,510 --> 00:15:41,010
terraform we have you know AWS

399
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:42,870
CloudFormation that will allow us to

400
00:15:41,010 --> 00:15:45,930
spun those complex infrastructure quite

401
00:15:42,870 --> 00:15:49,399
easily so when I'm getting with this is

402
00:15:45,930 --> 00:15:52,140
that we've got this convergence between

403
00:15:49,399 --> 00:15:54,630
deficit cops and I'll say say cops I

404
00:15:52,140 --> 00:15:57,120
mean they almost become to some extent

405
00:15:54,630 --> 00:15:58,709
undistinguishable if you look at it on

406
00:15:57,120 --> 00:16:00,839
the surface of it especially in

407
00:15:58,709 --> 00:16:02,910
organizations which are entirely

408
00:16:00,839 --> 00:16:04,920
software driven you know everything in

409
00:16:02,910 --> 00:16:07,589
that organization is just software from

410
00:16:04,920 --> 00:16:09,329
from the infrastructure to operations to

411
00:16:07,589 --> 00:16:12,450
the actual product that they're making

412
00:16:09,330 --> 00:16:15,120
and everything else so getting back to

413
00:16:12,450 --> 00:16:18,560
the open deaths a cops model sorry the

414
00:16:15,120 --> 00:16:23,250
open desta cops project it is about

415
00:16:18,560 --> 00:16:26,459
essentially these three pillars that I'm

416
00:16:23,250 --> 00:16:29,010
gonna cover very very briefly and so the

417
00:16:26,459 --> 00:16:31,709
first one which when I was setting up

418
00:16:29,010 --> 00:16:33,480
the project just coming back from my you

419
00:16:31,709 --> 00:16:34,589
know my experience what I realized is

420
00:16:33,480 --> 00:16:35,820
that the first one which is very

421
00:16:34,589 --> 00:16:37,860
important is actually access to

422
00:16:35,820 --> 00:16:40,290
knowledge I realized there's a lot of

423
00:16:37,860 --> 00:16:43,620
resources out there like OS and so on so

424
00:16:40,290 --> 00:16:45,420
forth but a lot of these resources in my

425
00:16:43,620 --> 00:16:47,279
opinion they're written with developed a

426
00:16:45,420 --> 00:16:49,709
mindset which is great there is nothing

427
00:16:47,279 --> 00:16:53,580
but without about it but it's not it's

428
00:16:49,709 --> 00:16:56,819
not the way a offensive a person would

429
00:16:53,580 --> 00:16:58,650
write it in offensive sorry person who

430
00:16:56,820 --> 00:17:00,330
is sitting on offensive security side of

431
00:16:58,650 --> 00:17:02,760
things right I mean they have a very

432
00:17:00,330 --> 00:17:04,800
very different approach to the people

433
00:17:02,760 --> 00:17:07,349
who sit on a defensive side of things so

434
00:17:04,800 --> 00:17:08,938
I think it will be fundamental

435
00:17:07,349 --> 00:17:10,859
you know when building a project like

436
00:17:08,939 --> 00:17:12,689
this is to have access to knowledge but

437
00:17:10,859 --> 00:17:14,579
but knowledge which is very very

438
00:17:12,689 --> 00:17:16,860
different from what is already available

439
00:17:14,579 --> 00:17:18,928
and it's early days but we started

440
00:17:16,859 --> 00:17:20,309
putting it together some you know okay

441
00:17:18,929 --> 00:17:22,650
of course we're using github for all

442
00:17:20,309 --> 00:17:25,589
this as through death

443
00:17:22,650 --> 00:17:29,070
Cyclops engineers we basically started

444
00:17:25,589 --> 00:17:31,169
putting some conversations everyone can

445
00:17:29,070 --> 00:17:32,520
join and essentially start off the the

446
00:17:31,170 --> 00:17:34,230
conversation about gathering knowledge

447
00:17:32,520 --> 00:17:36,690
and just putting stuff together

448
00:17:34,230 --> 00:17:38,640
everything is source format the second

449
00:17:36,690 --> 00:17:40,530
thing is access to community again

450
00:17:38,640 --> 00:17:41,280
referencing back to my slides from the

451
00:17:40,530 --> 00:17:41,830
very beginning

452
00:17:41,280 --> 00:17:43,870
I think is

453
00:17:41,830 --> 00:17:46,178
also quite important now the deaf second

454
00:17:43,870 --> 00:17:49,029
conference is actually a great platform

455
00:17:46,179 --> 00:17:52,419
for information exchange and access to

456
00:17:49,029 --> 00:17:56,350
community not many probably realize how

457
00:17:52,419 --> 00:17:58,299
important is to actually you know know

458
00:17:56,350 --> 00:18:00,039
people you know there is a lot of

459
00:17:58,299 --> 00:18:03,100
information that is shared but it's not

460
00:18:00,039 --> 00:18:04,629
shared openly and it's very covered way

461
00:18:03,100 --> 00:18:06,549
of sharing information still there the

462
00:18:04,630 --> 00:18:08,380
channels and so on and so forth so I'm

463
00:18:06,549 --> 00:18:11,860
hoping that this project can improve or

464
00:18:08,380 --> 00:18:13,899
not that kind of conversation and of

465
00:18:11,860 --> 00:18:16,689
course this is just an example we've got

466
00:18:13,899 --> 00:18:17,918
people not many but this discounters is

467
00:18:16,690 --> 00:18:20,559
actually going up pretty much every day

468
00:18:17,919 --> 00:18:22,960
and last but not least and this is what

469
00:18:20,559 --> 00:18:24,580
I want to spend the second half of the

470
00:18:22,960 --> 00:18:26,950
presentation he's actually coming up

471
00:18:24,580 --> 00:18:29,350
with tools but more specifically with

472
00:18:26,950 --> 00:18:34,000
solutions which was set into the DES X

473
00:18:29,350 --> 00:18:37,209
there sec ops model pipeline so I want

474
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:39,519
to show you just three examples of tools

475
00:18:37,210 --> 00:18:42,760
and then some some broader vision of

476
00:18:39,519 --> 00:18:45,070
what I have in mind so honey tokens were

477
00:18:42,760 --> 00:18:47,590
already mentioned this morning and so

478
00:18:45,070 --> 00:18:49,809
the idea of a honey token is that as

479
00:18:47,590 --> 00:18:51,519
part of and again when I actually talk

480
00:18:49,809 --> 00:18:54,490
about this stuff just try to think of in

481
00:18:51,519 --> 00:18:56,260
terms of not just the you know not just

482
00:18:54,490 --> 00:18:57,399
the code that you write but actually the

483
00:18:56,260 --> 00:19:00,158
infrastructure that you build so

484
00:18:57,399 --> 00:19:02,168
everything's together right and actually

485
00:19:00,159 --> 00:19:05,980
before I open this I wanted to cover

486
00:19:02,169 --> 00:19:07,750
something else I was recently asked if

487
00:19:05,980 --> 00:19:10,149
you have a situation where a developer

488
00:19:07,750 --> 00:19:12,279
is making the same security mistakes

489
00:19:10,149 --> 00:19:14,139
over and over again what are you gonna

490
00:19:12,279 --> 00:19:15,399
do about it right I mean you can sit

491
00:19:14,139 --> 00:19:18,189
down with them and explain that they do

492
00:19:15,399 --> 00:19:21,549
it wrong but the right answer to this

493
00:19:18,190 --> 00:19:23,940
question is that I mean obviously the

494
00:19:21,549 --> 00:19:26,139
developer maybe have some sort of

495
00:19:23,940 --> 00:19:28,059
problem maybe understanding the subject

496
00:19:26,139 --> 00:19:29,740
but the simple matter that the actual

497
00:19:28,059 --> 00:19:31,299
technology allows this to happen to

498
00:19:29,740 --> 00:19:33,399
begin with it's the core of the issue

499
00:19:31,299 --> 00:19:34,990
right so it's not it's not the case of

500
00:19:33,399 --> 00:19:36,518
penalizing the developers he's actually

501
00:19:34,990 --> 00:19:38,139
improving the technology to such extent

502
00:19:36,519 --> 00:19:39,730
actually this is no longer an issue

503
00:19:38,139 --> 00:19:42,490
doesn't matter what the developer who

504
00:19:39,730 --> 00:19:44,200
the developer is anyway going back to

505
00:19:42,490 --> 00:19:46,659
the honey tokens so the whole idea is

506
00:19:44,200 --> 00:19:49,870
this the whole idea is that if I

507
00:19:46,659 --> 00:19:51,549
generate some access credentials for

508
00:19:49,870 --> 00:19:55,320
example access tokens from a double yes

509
00:19:51,549 --> 00:19:58,350
or maybe whatever that is I can I

510
00:19:55,320 --> 00:19:59,820
I can just spread them around in my

511
00:19:58,350 --> 00:20:01,409
infrastructure maybe I can put them in

512
00:19:59,820 --> 00:20:02,879
as part of some lambda functions maybe I

513
00:20:01,410 --> 00:20:05,220
can put them in some docker containers

514
00:20:02,880 --> 00:20:06,870
maybe I can put them in you know maybe

515
00:20:05,220 --> 00:20:09,240
you can put them in some text files that

516
00:20:06,870 --> 00:20:11,189
lay here and there but the whole idea is

517
00:20:09,240 --> 00:20:13,679
that as soon as somebody uses these

518
00:20:11,190 --> 00:20:16,380
tokens to be able to access my system I

519
00:20:13,679 --> 00:20:19,380
know the dis is of normal behavior

520
00:20:16,380 --> 00:20:21,450
I don't need ACM to tell me that why

521
00:20:19,380 --> 00:20:23,160
because that's not what this stuff are

522
00:20:21,450 --> 00:20:25,320
meant for they're not used as part of

523
00:20:23,160 --> 00:20:27,720
the application you know they don't

524
00:20:25,320 --> 00:20:30,419
serve application function and so this

525
00:20:27,720 --> 00:20:33,300
is a very effective way in fact to catch

526
00:20:30,420 --> 00:20:36,750
guy you know to catch a breach almost at

527
00:20:33,300 --> 00:20:37,950
a very very early phase when the

528
00:20:36,750 --> 00:20:39,179
attacker doesn't know what this

529
00:20:37,950 --> 00:20:41,370
application is all about on the

530
00:20:39,179 --> 00:20:43,410
environment what is about and they quite

531
00:20:41,370 --> 00:20:46,620
literally be tempted to use some of

532
00:20:43,410 --> 00:20:49,110
these access tokens to infiltrate the

533
00:20:46,620 --> 00:20:50,370
application further but the beauty of

534
00:20:49,110 --> 00:20:51,990
this is that if you have this stuff

535
00:20:50,370 --> 00:20:53,669
already spread out everywhere this means

536
00:20:51,990 --> 00:20:55,470
that they act as a counter in a coalmine

537
00:20:53,670 --> 00:20:58,650
this kind of a stuff is super super

538
00:20:55,470 --> 00:21:01,110
simple to automate today you can write a

539
00:20:58,650 --> 00:21:02,730
bunch of terraform code I must say that

540
00:21:01,110 --> 00:21:04,350
the Terra phone that you see as a

541
00:21:02,730 --> 00:21:08,640
background has nothing to do with honey

542
00:21:04,350 --> 00:21:10,469
tokens it's just a show okay but the

543
00:21:08,640 --> 00:21:11,760
thing is that you can quite I mean for

544
00:21:10,470 --> 00:21:13,620
those of you who are familiar with their

545
00:21:11,760 --> 00:21:16,590
form you can already tell it's very very

546
00:21:13,620 --> 00:21:18,120
easy to generate some accounts to create

547
00:21:16,590 --> 00:21:19,620
access tokens of this account and

548
00:21:18,120 --> 00:21:21,059
essentially put them into a lambda

549
00:21:19,620 --> 00:21:23,699
function they're not use for anything

550
00:21:21,059 --> 00:21:24,960
really I mean they're just there you can

551
00:21:23,700 --> 00:21:26,550
put them in docker containers you can

552
00:21:24,960 --> 00:21:28,559
just put them anywhere else that you

553
00:21:26,550 --> 00:21:30,330
like but the whole point is that as soon

554
00:21:28,559 --> 00:21:31,980
as you see someone using those tokens

555
00:21:30,330 --> 00:21:34,230
you know this is a malicious activity

556
00:21:31,980 --> 00:21:35,670
right away and in fact you can automate

557
00:21:34,230 --> 00:21:37,590
it as much as actually blocking access

558
00:21:35,670 --> 00:21:41,809
as soon as you see some someone actually

559
00:21:37,590 --> 00:21:45,240
using that token another similar example

560
00:21:41,809 --> 00:21:46,678
darknets not many people I mean I've

561
00:21:45,240 --> 00:21:49,770
actually spoke to quite a few companies

562
00:21:46,679 --> 00:21:51,480
that have a desert cops model in their

563
00:21:49,770 --> 00:21:53,370
organizations at least they claim they

564
00:21:51,480 --> 00:21:55,460
have and they haven't heard of Newark

565
00:21:53,370 --> 00:21:58,439
nets and I think this is quite a

566
00:21:55,460 --> 00:22:00,300
oversight and I think maybe we haven't

567
00:21:58,440 --> 00:22:03,630
done enough education but the whole

568
00:22:00,300 --> 00:22:05,850
point of a darknet is that when I built

569
00:22:03,630 --> 00:22:08,190
my infrastructure and and I create my

570
00:22:05,850 --> 00:22:10,919
virtual private cloud or whatever

571
00:22:08,190 --> 00:22:12,750
I meant the different layers of the

572
00:22:10,920 --> 00:22:14,520
application but what I can do also I can

573
00:22:12,750 --> 00:22:19,050
leave gaps in between like a small

574
00:22:14,520 --> 00:22:21,960
subnets between the normal you know for

575
00:22:19,050 --> 00:22:26,399
example Virtual Private Network and so

576
00:22:21,960 --> 00:22:28,020
what this dark subnets do well nothing

577
00:22:26,400 --> 00:22:29,070
that's the whole point the whole point

578
00:22:28,020 --> 00:22:30,360
is that they're completely dark they

579
00:22:29,070 --> 00:22:31,860
have nothing in there they don't have

580
00:22:30,360 --> 00:22:34,560
resources they don't have servers they

581
00:22:31,860 --> 00:22:36,990
have nothing in there but if I see any

582
00:22:34,560 --> 00:22:38,490
activity on those networks its

583
00:22:36,990 --> 00:22:40,440
indication there is something Dodgers

584
00:22:38,490 --> 00:22:42,410
going on this is not meant and this is

585
00:22:40,440 --> 00:22:46,380
not a function of the application so

586
00:22:42,410 --> 00:22:49,830
again super trivial to ultimate as you

587
00:22:46,380 --> 00:22:51,660
can imagine CloudFormation terraform you

588
00:22:49,830 --> 00:22:54,629
can pretty much set this up on every

589
00:22:51,660 --> 00:22:57,330
environment that you can imagine from

590
00:22:54,630 --> 00:22:58,890
Azure to Google Cloud and we can set up

591
00:22:57,330 --> 00:23:00,600
these networks and and the thing is that

592
00:22:58,890 --> 00:23:03,270
we can analyze the traffic quite quite

593
00:23:00,600 --> 00:23:05,719
easily these days again with some some

594
00:23:03,270 --> 00:23:09,480
very basic supporting infrastructure and

595
00:23:05,720 --> 00:23:11,250
that traffic would tell us as soon as as

596
00:23:09,480 --> 00:23:13,170
soon as we see activity in there we can

597
00:23:11,250 --> 00:23:15,300
take a very proactive approach we don't

598
00:23:13,170 --> 00:23:17,580
need to notify someone to just kick off

599
00:23:15,300 --> 00:23:19,770
an incidence response on that what we

600
00:23:17,580 --> 00:23:23,820
can do well literally block access

601
00:23:19,770 --> 00:23:27,930
almost immediately and last but not

602
00:23:23,820 --> 00:23:30,929
least recon again if you follow some of

603
00:23:27,930 --> 00:23:34,830
the bug bounty programs and you see the

604
00:23:30,930 --> 00:23:37,020
kind of a box disclosed you will find

605
00:23:34,830 --> 00:23:39,169
out that there is a reoccurring team all

606
00:23:37,020 --> 00:23:42,990
over the place and the team is that

607
00:23:39,170 --> 00:23:45,510
people just I mean we just end up we

608
00:23:42,990 --> 00:23:47,160
could we end up exposing a misconfigure

609
00:23:45,510 --> 00:23:48,150
infrastructure in the most ridiculous

610
00:23:47,160 --> 00:23:51,000
possible ways

611
00:23:48,150 --> 00:23:55,320
so what attackers and most more every

612
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:57,510
bug hunter does these days it has a job

613
00:23:55,320 --> 00:23:59,639
that continuously monitor all the bug

614
00:23:57,510 --> 00:24:01,410
bounty programs you know new domains new

615
00:23:59,640 --> 00:24:05,250
markets new everything you know and

616
00:24:01,410 --> 00:24:06,810
that's like a 24/7 monitoring so why do

617
00:24:05,250 --> 00:24:08,700
we not do this as part of our

618
00:24:06,810 --> 00:24:11,010
infrastructures again there is almost

619
00:24:08,700 --> 00:24:12,120
zero cost of doing that tools are

620
00:24:11,010 --> 00:24:14,730
readily available

621
00:24:12,120 --> 00:24:16,199
most of them open source and all we need

622
00:24:14,730 --> 00:24:17,560
to do is just orchestrate it a little

623
00:24:16,200 --> 00:24:20,860
bit with some

624
00:24:17,560 --> 00:24:24,340
I don't know some cloud watch events

625
00:24:20,860 --> 00:24:27,280
starting a container runs a in a simple

626
00:24:24,340 --> 00:24:29,320
job with a you know off-the-shelf to and

627
00:24:27,280 --> 00:24:31,149
essentially pingers back on slack you

628
00:24:29,320 --> 00:24:34,450
know if you find something you know it's

629
00:24:31,150 --> 00:24:37,840
quite easy to do that and so those these

630
00:24:34,450 --> 00:24:42,130
solutions probably found out actually

631
00:24:37,840 --> 00:24:44,199
quite generic and so if we all go ahead

632
00:24:42,130 --> 00:24:46,150
and just do all this stuff on our own

633
00:24:44,200 --> 00:24:47,710
we're gonna basically rediscover the

634
00:24:46,150 --> 00:24:48,850
same thing at the same time you know I

635
00:24:47,710 --> 00:24:50,260
mean some of us probably would do it

636
00:24:48,850 --> 00:24:53,139
better than others but at the end of the

637
00:24:50,260 --> 00:24:57,190
day the solution is the same and so what

638
00:24:53,140 --> 00:24:58,990
the open dead-set cops project is

639
00:24:57,190 --> 00:25:02,500
designed to do is to actually create

640
00:24:58,990 --> 00:25:04,420
those mini solutions if you like that

641
00:25:02,500 --> 00:25:06,220
can be used almost as off-the-shelf

642
00:25:04,420 --> 00:25:08,530
tools you can just plug them in directly

643
00:25:06,220 --> 00:25:10,420
into your organization and they open the

644
00:25:08,530 --> 00:25:12,220
open source so there's no cost

645
00:25:10,420 --> 00:25:13,480
associated with it apart from maybe the

646
00:25:12,220 --> 00:25:16,390
cost that you need to pay for using

647
00:25:13,480 --> 00:25:19,510
these resources and this is kind of a

648
00:25:16,390 --> 00:25:22,410
map maybe of some ideas that we can we

649
00:25:19,510 --> 00:25:24,670
can even take it even further you know

650
00:25:22,410 --> 00:25:26,290
from you know creating static call

651
00:25:24,670 --> 00:25:28,000
analyzers to actually doing some

652
00:25:26,290 --> 00:25:31,090
research papers CloudFormation

653
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:33,580
keep in mind that if you have seen the

654
00:25:31,090 --> 00:25:35,709
top web application vulnerabilities in

655
00:25:33,580 --> 00:25:38,139
2007 there was a list that came out not

656
00:25:35,710 --> 00:25:39,670
too long ago these are all new stuff

657
00:25:38,140 --> 00:25:41,560
that probably nobody thinks about at the

658
00:25:39,670 --> 00:25:43,810
moment and so if you have people working

659
00:25:41,560 --> 00:25:45,370
on the offensive side of things they can

660
00:25:43,810 --> 00:25:47,080
pick up these things and essentially

661
00:25:45,370 --> 00:25:48,820
produce them almost as a ready-made

662
00:25:47,080 --> 00:25:52,270
solution that can be directly integrated

663
00:25:48,820 --> 00:25:54,370
into other people's infrastructure and

664
00:25:52,270 --> 00:25:59,139
so what's the goal

665
00:25:54,370 --> 00:26:01,629
well the goal is to go and and basically

666
00:25:59,140 --> 00:26:03,690
there's no goal the co is potentially to

667
00:26:01,630 --> 00:26:06,130
make something cool I think at the end

668
00:26:03,690 --> 00:26:08,230
but also the goal is to solve this

669
00:26:06,130 --> 00:26:11,170
problem because again it's a reoccurring

670
00:26:08,230 --> 00:26:12,790
theme and as I started initially we've

671
00:26:11,170 --> 00:26:15,760
got this idea of shifting to the left

672
00:26:12,790 --> 00:26:18,870
you know it becomes almost like you know

673
00:26:15,760 --> 00:26:21,610
it's tarsem to actually explain this but

674
00:26:18,870 --> 00:26:24,550
funny enough several years ago I was

675
00:26:21,610 --> 00:26:26,830
speaking to someone who I know who has a

676
00:26:24,550 --> 00:26:28,300
pen testing company and and and he

677
00:26:26,830 --> 00:26:31,060
actually told me that and now I

678
00:26:28,300 --> 00:26:34,540
reference back after so many years he

679
00:26:31,060 --> 00:26:36,340
said the way I said is that pentesting

680
00:26:34,540 --> 00:26:38,290
will become less and less relevant over

681
00:26:36,340 --> 00:26:40,689
the next several years that's what he

682
00:26:38,290 --> 00:26:42,399
said right and I did actually trigger to

683
00:26:40,690 --> 00:26:44,380
me at that point I realized yeah sure of

684
00:26:42,400 --> 00:26:47,620
course with the amount of automation we

685
00:26:44,380 --> 00:26:50,890
are throwing in it's less of a less

686
00:26:47,620 --> 00:26:53,679
valuable as it used to be right and and

687
00:26:50,890 --> 00:26:55,270
the whole point is to essentially shift

688
00:26:53,680 --> 00:26:56,860
all these services that we have from

689
00:26:55,270 --> 00:26:58,930
vulnerability research to pen testing

690
00:26:56,860 --> 00:27:01,360
the buff hunting which basically shift

691
00:26:58,930 --> 00:27:03,850
them into the on to the left basic

692
00:27:01,360 --> 00:27:06,159
automate as much as we can so that we

693
00:27:03,850 --> 00:27:08,560
don't need to worry about but also I

694
00:27:06,160 --> 00:27:10,210
think that what they have set cops is

695
00:27:08,560 --> 00:27:11,770
all about and again maybe some of you

696
00:27:10,210 --> 00:27:14,290
will disagree with me but I think it's

697
00:27:11,770 --> 00:27:16,800
about this sort of three things

698
00:27:14,290 --> 00:27:19,030
and here is that when we write software

699
00:27:16,800 --> 00:27:21,820
and again this will largely depends on

700
00:27:19,030 --> 00:27:23,139
the kind of a you know projects you're

701
00:27:21,820 --> 00:27:26,169
involved with but when you're writing

702
00:27:23,140 --> 00:27:27,910
software you essentially want your

703
00:27:26,170 --> 00:27:29,740
solution whether it's a network whether

704
00:27:27,910 --> 00:27:31,600
it's a software product you want to be

705
00:27:29,740 --> 00:27:35,110
self-governing in other words it needs

706
00:27:31,600 --> 00:27:39,550
to be it needs to govern itself in terms

707
00:27:35,110 --> 00:27:40,899
of allocates its own access provides

708
00:27:39,550 --> 00:27:42,270
access controls and everything else

709
00:27:40,900 --> 00:27:45,070
basically you should do it by itself

710
00:27:42,270 --> 00:27:46,270
logging and everything else it needs to

711
00:27:45,070 --> 00:27:49,240
be self-healing now we talk about

712
00:27:46,270 --> 00:27:51,400
self-healing when we talk about you know

713
00:27:49,240 --> 00:27:53,020
scaling you know by saying okay yeah if

714
00:27:51,400 --> 00:27:54,880
I kill the server I need to get another

715
00:27:53,020 --> 00:27:57,280
server almost automatically we're not

716
00:27:54,880 --> 00:27:59,020
talking we no actually refer using this

717
00:27:57,280 --> 00:28:00,910
terminology and reference of security

718
00:27:59,020 --> 00:28:06,430
right I mean self-healing means that

719
00:28:00,910 --> 00:28:08,860
okay if I detect someone you know

720
00:28:06,430 --> 00:28:11,290
probing my darknet coming from my IP

721
00:28:08,860 --> 00:28:13,030
address XYZ this means the day in that

722
00:28:11,290 --> 00:28:13,600
subnet and I just kill off access to

723
00:28:13,030 --> 00:28:16,149
that subnet

724
00:28:13,600 --> 00:28:18,429
that's self-healing okay in terms of

725
00:28:16,150 --> 00:28:20,470
security and sorry and also self

726
00:28:18,430 --> 00:28:24,550
defending which kind of is on the same

727
00:28:20,470 --> 00:28:29,110
spectrum of things and so I think I'm

728
00:28:24,550 --> 00:28:31,810
okay for time so you can find me on

729
00:28:29,110 --> 00:28:35,169
Twitter I managed to snap this really

730
00:28:31,810 --> 00:28:37,690
really short name PDP and so check me

731
00:28:35,170 --> 00:28:40,020
out funny enough actually I got also a

732
00:28:37,690 --> 00:28:41,830
lot of Nigerian spam allegedly

733
00:28:40,020 --> 00:28:43,779
apparently PD

734
00:28:41,830 --> 00:28:47,168
is also the people Democratic Party of

735
00:28:43,779 --> 00:28:49,750
Nigeria and everybody hates me so I

736
00:28:47,169 --> 00:28:54,820
believe that I'm I'm the real nigerian

737
00:28:49,750 --> 00:28:56,169
prince so and i basically represent

738
00:28:54,820 --> 00:28:58,450
these three organizations which all

739
00:28:56,169 --> 00:29:00,700
different projects that I've used in my

740
00:28:58,450 --> 00:29:03,309
career Guinness is a web security I work

741
00:29:00,700 --> 00:29:06,690
security and seconds and I can take

742
00:29:03,309 --> 00:29:06,690
questions we've got 10 minutes

743
00:29:15,380 --> 00:29:18,010
No

744
00:29:20,309 --> 00:29:25,799
okay there's no questions I'm gonna

745
00:29:22,390 --> 00:29:28,710
leave this for a couple of seconds then

746
00:29:25,799 --> 00:29:35,889
cool well thank you very much

747
00:29:28,710 --> 00:29:35,890
[Applause]
