today got any questions and you're not

19
00:00:41,070 --> 00:00:42,960
on the slack just pop on to the secure

20
00:00:42,960 --> 00:00:45,120
developer comm and the top right hand

21
00:00:45,120 --> 00:00:46,770
corner you'll see join and we'll give

22
00:00:46,770 --> 00:00:48,059
you all the information on joining and

23
00:00:48,059 --> 00:00:50,100
slack and if you can join the live

24
00:00:50,100 --> 00:00:54,210
sessions and channel you can answer

25
00:00:54,210 --> 00:00:55,350
questions in there and we'll get them

26
00:00:55,350 --> 00:00:58,199
over to Simon for today the other thing

27
00:00:58,199 --> 00:00:59,579
to do is in your bottom right hand

28
00:00:59,579 --> 00:01:01,020
corner you'll see a little cog if you

29
00:01:01,020 --> 00:01:03,359
can at the resolution to maximum it'll

30
00:01:03,359 --> 00:01:04,860
be the best way to view today's session

31
00:01:04,860 --> 00:01:08,040
and I think that's it for me would love

32
00:01:08,040 --> 00:01:09,540
you to share so you can find uh some

33
00:01:09,540 --> 00:01:12,150
toilet atmosphere div or a sink on the

34
00:01:12,150 --> 00:01:13,740
web side and the session will be posted

35
00:01:13,740 --> 00:01:16,470
on the web side after today I think

36
00:01:16,470 --> 00:01:18,030
that's enough for me I'm gonna hand over

37
00:01:18,030 --> 00:01:21,659

the vast majority of this report was

69
00:02:33,100 --> 00:02:34,840
done by Iran so let me introduce their

70
00:02:34,840 --> 00:02:37,330
aunt are around $2 a developer advocates

71
00:02:37,330 --> 00:02:39,160
Nick please tell us a little bit banks

72
00:02:39,160 --> 00:02:43,810

00:02:43,810 --> 00:02:46,900
couple of months ago been really happy

74
00:02:46,900 --> 00:02:48,820
with the right so far and the report has

75
00:02:48,820 --> 00:02:51,640
been immensely insightful on building

76
00:02:51,640 --> 00:02:53,980
that so so thank you Simon for all the

77
00:02:53,980 --> 00:02:56,440
help with that as well just a bit of

78
00:02:56,440 --> 00:02:58,420
background for me I've been doing a lot

79
00:02:58,420 --> 00:03:01,000
of security around the node and carrot

80
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:03,460
foundation true true the node foundation

81
00:03:03,460 --> 00:03:05,440
itself actually and then I would echo

82
00:03:05,440 --> 00:03:10,180
system to being also advocated for OS

83
00:03:10,180 --> 00:03:12,340
true what through the node project which

84
00:03:12,340 --> 00:03:15,580
can work on contribute to helping raise

85
00:03:15,580 --> 00:03:18,520
awareness on that project and have

86
00:03:18,520 --> 00:03:22,150
doubled and right Oh Jay security so

87
00:03:22,150 --> 00:03:25,540

88
00:03:25,540 --> 00:03:27,730
last couple of years a little bit more

00:03:51,910 --> 00:03:54,670
container security prior to Google I

101
00:03:54,670 --> 00:03:56,019

managed the cotta containers project and

104
00:04:00,250 --> 00:04:01,959
was on the release management team for

105
00:04:01,959 --> 00:04:03,940
the OpenStack project which if you're

106
00:04:03,940 --> 00:04:05,890
not familiar it's an open source cloud

107
00:04:05,890 --> 00:04:08,260
infrastructure and one of the larger

108
00:04:08,260 --> 00:04:10,900
open source projects in the world so

109
00:04:10,900 --> 00:04:13,750
that's a little bit about me listen

110

security consultant be doing up several

119
00:04:33,600 --> 00:04:36,000
years now that means my day job is

120
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:38,460
generally going in breaking clients

121
00:04:38,460 --> 00:04:40,470
applications and then helping them to

122
00:04:40,470 --> 00:04:43,230
fix them afterwards but I also spend a

123
00:04:43,230 --> 00:04:44,160
fair amount of time

124
00:04:44,160 --> 00:04:46,590
advising generally on secure application

125
00:04:46,590 --> 00:04:48,900
architecture and secure development as

126
00:04:48,900 --> 00:04:52,500
well to sort more earlier stage sort of

127
00:04:52,500 --> 00:04:55,290
the shifting left started style like I

128
00:04:55,290 --> 00:04:56,940
say I'm a member of the OSP our board

129
00:04:56,940 --> 00:04:59,510
and I'm one of the organizers of the OS

130
00:04:59,510 --> 00:05:01,770
global outset Tel Aviv conference which

131
00:05:01,770 --> 00:05:03,960
is coming up at the end of May over here

132
00:05:03,960 --> 00:05:05,460
in sunny as well that should be great

133
00:05:05,460 --> 00:05:08,820
fun yeah and we're working with one more

134
00:05:08,820 --> 00:05:16,350
trip more information about not say just

135
00:05:16,350 --> 00:05:21,479
to put you on the spot so the I think

136
00:05:21,479 --> 00:05:25,080
actually get 1/2 sec you I think that

137
00:05:25,080 --> 00:05:27,060
actually read a conference website am I

138
00:05:27,060 --> 00:05:29,360
right yes it does it's not so simple

139
00:05:29,360 --> 00:05:32,270
chat as well I do like the abstract

140
00:05:32,270 --> 00:05:34,500
conferences so that's definitely one

141
00:05:34,500 --> 00:05:38,870
that's there people's would look up yeah

142
00:05:38,870 --> 00:05:41,310
so without further ado let's let's first

143
00:05:41,310 --> 00:05:43,440
jump in and LaRon is the author of group

144
00:05:43,440 --> 00:05:44,430
what are you give us a quick overview

145
00:05:44,430 --> 00:05:45,900
about some of the highlights some of the

146
00:05:45,900 --> 00:05:47,150
things that really stood out for you

147
00:05:47,150 --> 00:05:50,270
from the statements or security report

148
00:05:50,270 --> 00:05:56,210
sure what report is that Jay gamer cool

149
00:05:56,210 --> 00:06:00,600
I thought the generally okay all right

150
00:06:00,600 --> 00:06:03,389
so yeah I think you kind of tried to

151
00:06:03,389 --> 00:06:05,430
give an intro on that and I think it's

152
00:06:05,430 --> 00:06:07,650
important to also highlight that what I

153
00:06:07,650 --> 00:06:09,570
really like about this report is that we

154
00:06:09,570 --> 00:06:11,430
managed to to bring in like several

155
00:06:11,430 --> 00:06:13,289
perspectives you know open source

156
00:06:13,289 --> 00:06:15,690
security one of them being like the

157
00:06:15,690 --> 00:06:18,000
human side of it through kind of having

158
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:20,430
a survey and asking Mainers and

159
00:06:20,430 --> 00:06:22,410
developers how do they you know taking

160
00:06:22,410 --> 00:06:24,990
security what kind of stuff do they do

161
00:06:24,990 --> 00:06:28,260
around it etc and was the the data side

162
00:06:28,260 --> 00:06:30,660
of it which is also kind of built like

163
00:06:30,660 --> 00:06:33,080
around several layers so it's a

164
00:06:33,080 --> 00:06:35,390
application security and then you know

165
00:06:35,390 --> 00:06:38,670
OS library security and that's kind

166
00:06:38,670 --> 00:06:41,160
reflected into docker which was an

167
00:06:41,160 --> 00:06:43,770
interesting piece of information that we

168
00:06:43,770 --> 00:06:46,680
found out through building it so so some

169
00:06:46,680 --> 00:06:50,190
key takeaways I think are you know if we

170
00:06:50,190 --> 00:06:53,190
take a look at the amount of you know

171
00:06:53,190 --> 00:06:54,930
situation vulnerabilities that got is

172
00:06:54,930 --> 00:06:57,330
closed we're seeing that you know around

173
00:06:57,330 --> 00:06:59,610
you know other guys put that into a time

174
00:06:59,610 --> 00:07:02,910
line so the number almost doubled over

175
00:07:02,910 --> 00:07:04,590
the last two years just from plication

176
00:07:04,590 --> 00:07:07,080
from your abilities big is closed and if

177
00:07:07,080 --> 00:07:10,320
you take a look at you know the same

178
00:07:10,320 --> 00:07:12,390
graph the same kind of period graph over

179
00:07:12,390 --> 00:07:15,420
time line for system libraries

180
00:07:15,420 --> 00:07:17,490
vulnerabilities you would see the same

181
00:07:17,490 --> 00:07:18,830
trend right so we're seeing

182
00:07:18,830 --> 00:07:21,930
vulnerabilities kind of jumping in in

183
00:07:21,930 --> 00:07:24,240
that sense as well and that gave us

184
00:07:24,240 --> 00:07:27,090
insight into finding out that when we

185
00:07:27,090 --> 00:07:31,980
looked into talker mo 10 most popular

186
00:07:31,980 --> 00:07:33,570
that are proven just around the duck

187
00:07:33,570 --> 00:07:35,730
Rahad websites just counting them we

188
00:07:35,730 --> 00:07:37,620
find out that you know each and every

189
00:07:37,620 --> 00:07:38,970
one of them had the three story

190
00:07:38,970 --> 00:07:42,090
vulnerabilities found for the for each

191
00:07:42,090 --> 00:07:45,480
of those and I'm not sure like a lot of

192
00:07:45,480 --> 00:07:48,240
people really understood the the you

193
00:07:48,240 --> 00:07:51,000
know the impact of that and when we even

194
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:53,310
dive into a little bit deeper deeper in

195
00:07:53,310 --> 00:07:54,660
do you know what kind of vulnerability

196
00:07:54,660 --> 00:07:56,790
stored Osorio well you found a

197
00:07:56,790 --> 00:07:58,200
vulnerability what can you do about it

198
00:07:58,200 --> 00:08:00,990
so this is a piece of data that we found

199
00:08:00,990 --> 00:08:03,510
out from sneaked theta which is also

200
00:08:03,510 --> 00:08:07,110
kind of insightful around just figuring

201
00:08:07,110 --> 00:08:09,930
out that the fact of out of all the

202
00:08:09,930 --> 00:08:12,030
scanned dr. images that we found you

203
00:08:12,030 --> 00:08:15,420
know you could 44% of out of all of

204
00:08:15,420 --> 00:08:18,720
those you could just fix them by a

205
00:08:18,720 --> 00:08:20,310
retreat you know lower the amount of

206
00:08:20,310 --> 00:08:22,230
vulnerabilities found in them just by

207
00:08:22,230 --> 00:08:24,450
updating your base image so just moving

208
00:08:24,450 --> 00:08:27,000
from you know I don't want you to win to

209
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:28,320
slim or something like that we just

210
00:08:28,320 --> 00:08:30,330
lower the amount of vulnerabilities you

211
00:08:30,330 --> 00:08:34,530
know just 20% of of those doctor images

212
00:08:34,530 --> 00:08:35,789
if you just rebuild them you know just

213
00:08:35,789 --> 00:08:37,620
get even you're on the same image that

214
00:08:37,620 --> 00:08:39,690
but those image tags get built all the

215
00:08:39,690 --> 00:08:41,729
time so if you would just rebuild it

216
00:08:41,729 --> 00:08:43,110
more often you know when you would not

217
00:08:43,110 --> 00:08:45,690
have some kind of longleaf docker

218
00:08:45,690 --> 00:08:48,600
container out there you would get a lot

219
00:08:48,600 --> 00:08:50,520
of benefit out of lowering your

220
00:08:50,520 --> 00:08:52,100
vulnerabilities

221
00:08:52,100 --> 00:08:54,259
so we got into I think this very

222
00:08:54,259 --> 00:08:57,560
insightful kind of pieces of information

223
00:08:57,560 --> 00:08:59,899
and I think some other really key

224
00:08:59,899 --> 00:09:02,300
takeaways were from the human side of

225
00:09:02,300 --> 00:09:04,070
you know how people take security so

226
00:09:04,070 --> 00:09:06,170
what the thing we noticed is you know

227
00:09:06,170 --> 00:09:09,440
maintainer is have good intent or into

228
00:09:09,440 --> 00:09:11,720
being you know security aware so for

229
00:09:11,720 --> 00:09:14,240
example when we ask the velop or you

230
00:09:14,240 --> 00:09:16,880
know how do they feel about owning the

231
00:09:16,880 --> 00:09:18,769
open-source security of what they built

232
00:09:18,769 --> 00:09:20,540
right your application and stuff like

233
00:09:20,540 --> 00:09:23,480
that so 81% of them you know one to own

234
00:09:23,480 --> 00:09:26,569
security and I think that's that's an

235
00:09:26,569 --> 00:09:29,480
amazing number very positively impacting

236
00:09:29,480 --> 00:09:31,579
the fact that I think you know all of

237
00:09:31,579 --> 00:09:33,019
the work that everyone here on this

238
00:09:33,019 --> 00:09:35,990
panel are involved in is kind of taking

239
00:09:35,990 --> 00:09:37,370
shape and you know the awareness and

240
00:09:37,370 --> 00:09:41,290
engagement is out there and it's working

241
00:09:41,290 --> 00:09:43,579
when we ask them about you know taking

242
00:09:43,579 --> 00:09:44,839
the responsibility of their docker

243
00:09:44,839 --> 00:09:51,050
images which is I think in and not not a

244
00:09:51,050 --> 00:09:53,690
less astonishing number is 68 percent of

245
00:09:53,690 --> 00:09:55,009
them feel that they should should own

246
00:09:55,009 --> 00:09:57,019
that as well which is even more

247
00:09:57,019 --> 00:09:59,149
insightful in terms of showing how

248
00:09:59,149 --> 00:10:02,420
DevOps is really you know working in

249
00:10:02,420 --> 00:10:04,699
terms of the developer teams and stuff

250
00:10:04,699 --> 00:10:08,899
like that a little bit to contrast that

251
00:10:08,899 --> 00:10:11,720
is while I think Mainers and developers

252
00:10:11,720 --> 00:10:13,940
have those good intentions of you know

253
00:10:13,940 --> 00:10:16,540
owning security we're saying still that

254
00:10:16,540 --> 00:10:19,279
37% of them are not implementing any

255
00:10:19,279 --> 00:10:21,529
kind of security testing under sea ice

256
00:10:21,529 --> 00:10:22,670
in Drupal systems

257
00:10:22,670 --> 00:10:24,949
half of them are not implementing any

258
00:10:24,949 --> 00:10:28,010
kind of docker image security testing so

259
00:10:28,010 --> 00:10:30,350
so there's like a bit of you know juries

260
00:10:30,350 --> 00:10:32,269
is like a the good and bad into this

261
00:10:32,269 --> 00:10:36,709
there's a good intent in in in being

262
00:10:36,709 --> 00:10:39,350
there and taking ownership but I think

263
00:10:39,350 --> 00:10:42,260
we still we still need a lot of tooling

264
00:10:42,260 --> 00:10:44,500
and culture and you know helping

265
00:10:44,500 --> 00:10:46,579
developers and maintain is kind of

266
00:10:46,579 --> 00:10:50,959
embraced security a lot more into what

267
00:10:50,959 --> 00:10:53,540
they do into their streamlined workflows

268
00:10:53,540 --> 00:10:56,180
and stuff like that interesting in it it

269
00:10:56,180 --> 00:10:57,949
sounds so much it sounds so much more

270
00:10:57,949 --> 00:11:01,100
believable when I want to Jedi Master as

271
00:11:01,100 --> 00:11:03,829
well so you know it's pretty interesting

272
00:11:03,829 --> 00:11:06,420
takeaways there and and and some barrier

273
00:11:06,420 --> 00:11:08,730
and stats which are both from from what

274
00:11:08,730 --> 00:11:11,190
I understand from from a survey that was

275
00:11:11,190 --> 00:11:12,750
that was given as well as data which has

276
00:11:12,750 --> 00:11:14,730
been mine so data that they existence

277
00:11:14,730 --> 00:11:16,740
out today as well so let's take that

278
00:11:16,740 --> 00:11:18,180
let's take a deeper dive into some of

279
00:11:18,180 --> 00:11:21,690
those and so so let's start with let's

280
00:11:21,690 --> 00:11:23,519
start with Josh one thing key takeaways

281
00:11:23,519 --> 00:11:26,370
there which which which Lauren mentioned

282
00:11:26,370 --> 00:11:28,199
was that we've seen an 88 percent

283
00:11:28,199 --> 00:11:31,949
increase in in the number of open source

284
00:11:31,949 --> 00:11:33,570
sorry the number of vulnerabilities

285
00:11:33,570 --> 00:11:35,699
application library vulnerabilities over

286
00:11:35,699 --> 00:11:37,320
just in two years we've always done

287
00:11:37,320 --> 00:11:40,589
within a couple of years what about what

288
00:11:40,589 --> 00:11:41,910
do you think the main drivers are of

289
00:11:41,910 --> 00:11:43,980
this is it the open source growth is it

290
00:11:43,980 --> 00:11:46,410
is it the more of a focus on security

291
00:11:46,410 --> 00:11:48,570
what is what is your kind of view and

292
00:11:48,570 --> 00:11:49,829
maybe even some of the some of the

293
00:11:49,829 --> 00:11:51,510
insights that we eating maybe grab from

294
00:11:51,510 --> 00:11:53,850
a wasp as law yeah I think it make a

295
00:11:53,850 --> 00:11:55,740
couple of very good points down I mean

296
00:11:55,740 --> 00:11:57,779
certain first of all the growth in the

297
00:11:57,779 --> 00:11:59,220
exponential growth a growth of how many

298
00:11:59,220 --> 00:12:01,680
libraries there are they're available

299
00:12:01,680 --> 00:12:03,360
how many organizations are now taking

300
00:12:03,360 --> 00:12:06,120
advantage of these libraries and I think

301
00:12:06,120 --> 00:12:08,310
also the increased awareness ultimately

302
00:12:08,310 --> 00:12:10,410
we're seeing an increase in how many

303
00:12:10,410 --> 00:12:11,550
Veronese has been discovered that

304
00:12:11,550 --> 00:12:12,750
doesn't necessarily mean an increase in

305
00:12:12,750 --> 00:12:13,740
how many vulnerabilities are actually

306
00:12:13,740 --> 00:12:17,370
there to begin with so I think in some

307
00:12:17,370 --> 00:12:18,930
ways that's a good sign that the

308
00:12:18,930 --> 00:12:21,899
vulnerabilities are being found at the

309
00:12:21,899 --> 00:12:24,870
same time the holes of open source

310
00:12:24,870 --> 00:12:28,500
library system does bring very

311
00:12:28,500 --> 00:12:29,790
significant challenges because of this I

312
00:12:29,790 --> 00:12:30,720
mean ultimately though there are

313
00:12:30,720 --> 00:12:34,470
vulnerabilities caused by yeah I suppose

314
00:12:34,470 --> 00:12:37,589
scope coding errors but also very

315
00:12:37,589 --> 00:12:39,540
concerning is the sort of the the

316
00:12:39,540 --> 00:12:43,010
deliberate supply chain poisoning by

317
00:12:43,010 --> 00:12:45,420
either a malicious developer is

318
00:12:45,420 --> 00:12:48,449
inserting something not not desirable

319
00:12:48,449 --> 00:12:49,829
into a library then gets put into a

320
00:12:49,829 --> 00:12:51,630
large piece of software alternatively a

321
00:12:51,630 --> 00:12:52,800
developer's account is getting taken

322
00:12:52,800 --> 00:12:57,089
over and then that malicious code has

323
00:12:57,089 --> 00:12:59,819
been being put in so I think it's

324
00:12:59,819 --> 00:13:03,209
certainly a growing a growing problem

325
00:13:03,209 --> 00:13:06,589
and definitely seeing as well that

326
00:13:06,589 --> 00:13:08,519
developers are aware of this issue and

327
00:13:08,519 --> 00:13:10,649
they are trying to find ways to deal

328
00:13:10,649 --> 00:13:15,510
with it I think that I hope that slowly

329
00:13:15,510 --> 00:13:17,100
developers will start to have a better

330
00:13:17,100 --> 00:13:18,839
understanding of what libraries are

331
00:13:18,839 --> 00:13:20,190
actually using where the

332
00:13:20,190 --> 00:13:23,070
libraries are actually coming from I do

333
00:13:23,070 --> 00:13:24,600
I do even wonder where that we're gonna

334
00:13:24,600 --> 00:13:26,220
start singing move towards some sort of

335
00:13:26,220 --> 00:13:27,810
trusted registries we're on right now

336
00:13:27,810 --> 00:13:30,330
there tend to be a few very very large

337
00:13:30,330 --> 00:13:32,160
but completely open registries I wonder

338
00:13:32,160 --> 00:13:34,380
whether companies will start looking

339
00:13:34,380 --> 00:13:36,930
into okay can I get a a trusted registry

340
00:13:36,930 --> 00:13:38,100
where it doesn't have everything but I

341
00:13:38,100 --> 00:13:39,660
know that whatever's in there I can rely

342
00:13:39,660 --> 00:13:42,180
on that someone has looked at it private

343
00:13:42,180 --> 00:13:43,980
crafted registry Lord registry that just

344
00:13:43,980 --> 00:13:49,790
has greater governance around it so I

345
00:13:49,790 --> 00:13:53,880
want my thought is that if a company is

346
00:13:53,880 --> 00:13:55,710
big enough I guess it can stand up its

347
00:13:55,710 --> 00:13:57,150
own private trusted registry that

348
00:13:57,150 --> 00:13:58,560
obviously requires a company of a

349
00:13:58,560 --> 00:14:01,020
certain size alternative it may be a

350
00:14:01,020 --> 00:14:02,520
third party it says okay look we're

351
00:14:02,520 --> 00:14:04,680
gonna take how we're going to stand up

352
00:14:04,680 --> 00:14:06,360
our registry I'm gonna allow other

353
00:14:06,360 --> 00:14:08,580
companies to use it and we offer certain

354
00:14:08,580 --> 00:14:12,300
guarantees or certain assurance over

355
00:14:12,300 --> 00:14:14,610
this registry that companies can then

356
00:14:14,610 --> 00:14:15,750
feel a little bit more comfortable than

357
00:14:15,750 --> 00:14:18,540
just sort of doing NPM install and

358
00:14:18,540 --> 00:14:20,130
hoping for the best I guess which is

359
00:14:20,130 --> 00:14:22,140
interesting on the contrast say NPM may

360
00:14:22,140 --> 00:14:23,310
even actually because of course you know

361
00:14:23,310 --> 00:14:24,870
when we think about them you know

362
00:14:24,870 --> 00:14:26,790
malicious packages we see we see them

363
00:14:26,790 --> 00:14:28,170
more on the NPM registries than that

364
00:14:28,170 --> 00:14:30,690
than the maiden registries right so and

365
00:14:30,690 --> 00:14:33,180
do you think do you think the solutions

366
00:14:33,180 --> 00:14:34,680
this exists on the registry side or do

367
00:14:34,680 --> 00:14:36,060
you think is more on the applique on the

368
00:14:36,060 --> 00:14:38,760
on the developers side that's a great

369
00:14:38,760 --> 00:14:40,800
question um yeah I think one of the

370
00:14:40,800 --> 00:14:43,320
biggest things to define but we're

371
00:14:43,320 --> 00:14:44,670
seeing an increase in open-source growth

372
00:14:44,670 --> 00:14:46,020
in general and kind of a normalization

373
00:14:46,020 --> 00:14:47,820
of it is that we need to encourage

374
00:14:47,820 --> 00:14:50,400
people to be informed consumers you know

375
00:14:50,400 --> 00:14:51,540
everyone is going to have a slightly

376
00:14:51,540 --> 00:14:53,370
different trust model security profile a

377
00:14:53,370 --> 00:14:55,170
different approach to whether that means

378
00:14:55,170 --> 00:14:56,850
I need to host my own private registry

379
00:14:56,850 --> 00:14:58,470
or I need to establish a trusted

380
00:14:58,470 --> 00:15:01,620
registry I think the thing I saw your

381
00:15:01,620 --> 00:15:03,990
the 88 percent for example and I I think

382
00:15:03,990 --> 00:15:06,120
it's worth emphasizing that you know

383
00:15:06,120 --> 00:15:07,830
there there can be vulnerabilities in

384
00:15:07,830 --> 00:15:08,730
both open source and proprietary

385
00:15:08,730 --> 00:15:10,260
software and we shouldn't be afraid of

386
00:15:10,260 --> 00:15:12,060
these these big numbers they can mean a

387
00:15:12,060 --> 00:15:13,890
lot of things Josh I think you just hit

388
00:15:13,890 --> 00:15:16,380
it on the nose with disclosure is not

389
00:15:16,380 --> 00:15:20,130
the same as existence but I think you

390
00:15:20,130 --> 00:15:23,310
know as people bring in open source you

391
00:15:23,310 --> 00:15:24,630
care you have to remember you can't just

392
00:15:24,630 --> 00:15:27,000
get clone and walk away you need to know

393
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:28,710
we're in this community that do they be

394
00:15:28,710 --> 00:15:30,210
disclosed vulnerabilities where do I

395
00:15:30,210 --> 00:15:31,620
need to be to make sure when a patch

396
00:15:31,620 --> 00:15:32,010
comes

397
00:15:32,010 --> 00:15:34,020
I'm getting it you know what finding

398
00:15:34,020 --> 00:15:35,340
those communication lines I think that's

399
00:15:35,340 --> 00:15:37,830
something that's really important as

400
00:15:37,830 --> 00:15:40,110
people journey into the open source

401
00:15:40,110 --> 00:15:47,040
world mm-hmm dad there's an interesting

402
00:15:47,040 --> 00:15:48,600
insight on that would you like to do

403
00:15:48,600 --> 00:15:50,850
known vulnerabilities in you know what's

404
00:15:50,850 --> 00:15:52,650
kind of unknown and I think we kind of

405
00:15:52,650 --> 00:15:55,860
found something you know kind of related

406
00:15:55,860 --> 00:15:58,140
to that in the report which is we

407
00:15:58,140 --> 00:16:02,010
retract a couple of very high you know

408
00:16:02,010 --> 00:16:04,740
high profile packages on NPM and the

409
00:16:04,740 --> 00:16:06,600
security disclosures that work for them

410
00:16:06,600 --> 00:16:09,990
and you know we found that security

411
00:16:09,990 --> 00:16:11,490
vulnerability actually existed in the

412
00:16:11,490 --> 00:16:13,560
code you know for like almost two two

413
00:16:13,560 --> 00:16:16,560
and a half years until it was until it

414
00:16:16,560 --> 00:16:18,360
was disclosed you know found and fixed

415
00:16:18,360 --> 00:16:19,950
and everything and it was like the

416
00:16:19,950 --> 00:16:21,600
median time for it and you know the

417
00:16:21,600 --> 00:16:23,940
worst time was like almost six years the

418
00:16:23,940 --> 00:16:25,560
quickest time was you know almost 20

419
00:16:25,560 --> 00:16:28,380
years so it's kind of relating to to

420
00:16:28,380 --> 00:16:29,850
what you know Josh and I are saying you

421
00:16:29,850 --> 00:16:31,680
know there's these are only the known

422
00:16:31,680 --> 00:16:32,550
vulnerabilities

423
00:16:32,550 --> 00:16:34,650
it doesn't mean you know there's so many

424
00:16:34,650 --> 00:16:36,120
stuff that we probably don't know yet

425
00:16:36,120 --> 00:16:39,180
and you know we'll get discovered and

426
00:16:39,180 --> 00:16:42,740
just just like a point on unperfect or a

427
00:16:42,740 --> 00:16:46,530
closed source stuff like that is I was

428
00:16:46,530 --> 00:16:49,620
at a college actually discussing you

429
00:16:49,620 --> 00:16:51,090
know it seems like from the

430
00:16:51,090 --> 00:16:53,400
vulnerability which students for a cyber

431
00:16:53,400 --> 00:16:56,580
uh major degree and you know one of them

432
00:16:56,580 --> 00:17:01,140
was was asking me do we do we know you

433
00:17:01,140 --> 00:17:04,440
know how do we feel about open source in

434
00:17:04,440 --> 00:17:06,119
terms of security versus closed source

435
00:17:06,119 --> 00:17:08,720
meaning you know tech kind of I think

436
00:17:08,720 --> 00:17:11,700
taking a look at what every Kremlin said

437
00:17:11,700 --> 00:17:13,589
about you know Linux and stuff like that

438
00:17:13,589 --> 00:17:15,690
you know given enough eyeballs all bugs

439
00:17:15,690 --> 00:17:18,750
are shallow so you know would would we

440
00:17:18,750 --> 00:17:20,819
would we assume you know I think that

441
00:17:20,819 --> 00:17:24,089
kind of we assume that as we use open

442
00:17:24,089 --> 00:17:25,770
source software because it's just outer

443
00:17:25,770 --> 00:17:28,770
and people are seeing it you know more

444
00:17:28,770 --> 00:17:30,750
people are saying it we would we would

445
00:17:30,750 --> 00:17:32,400
find those security vulnerabilities

446
00:17:32,400 --> 00:17:35,580
maybe much quicker but I'm not really

447
00:17:35,580 --> 00:17:36,660
sure you know I don't think we have

448
00:17:36,660 --> 00:17:38,790
exact numbers of that or research on

449
00:17:38,790 --> 00:17:41,040
that specific know closed versus open

450
00:17:41,040 --> 00:17:45,420
source security I know I just just kind

451
00:17:45,420 --> 00:17:45,690
of

452
00:17:45,690 --> 00:17:47,039
mocking the discussion around this if

453
00:17:47,039 --> 00:17:49,529
you want to share and I think I think in

454
00:17:49,529 --> 00:17:51,419
terms of the the open versus closed

455
00:17:51,419 --> 00:17:54,480
source I think that I think that the

456
00:17:54,480 --> 00:17:57,899
many eyes assumes that the many eyes are

457
00:17:57,899 --> 00:18:00,029
actually looking and I think that's

458
00:18:00,029 --> 00:18:02,399
definitely see I mean look at the it's

459
00:18:02,399 --> 00:18:04,679
not not not directly later but if you

460
00:18:04,679 --> 00:18:07,019
look at something open SSL bugs or

461
00:18:07,019 --> 00:18:09,090
something over there for many many many

462
00:18:09,090 --> 00:18:11,070
years and that was always open source

463
00:18:11,070 --> 00:18:12,240
but just no one was looking at a

464
00:18:12,240 --> 00:18:13,830
particular point exactly

465
00:18:13,830 --> 00:18:17,309
and but at the same time certainly close

466
00:18:17,309 --> 00:18:18,990
source just means you don't necessary

467
00:18:18,990 --> 00:18:20,210
know about it but we do know that

468
00:18:20,210 --> 00:18:25,350
example look at Dobby or Java in a

469
00:18:25,350 --> 00:18:27,750
software that isn't really thought of as

470
00:18:27,750 --> 00:18:30,899
open source but you see update after

471
00:18:30,899 --> 00:18:32,399
update after update for security

472
00:18:32,399 --> 00:18:34,320
beaucoup de bellas artes security bugs

473
00:18:34,320 --> 00:18:36,450
so certainly no less for a problem I

474
00:18:36,450 --> 00:18:39,389
guess the first time for the open source

475
00:18:39,389 --> 00:18:43,559
is possible to say it I think something

476
00:18:43,559 --> 00:18:45,389
interesting that the an mentioned about

477
00:18:45,389 --> 00:18:47,370
finding out about the findings and

478
00:18:47,370 --> 00:18:48,690
finding out about vulnerabilities

479
00:18:48,690 --> 00:18:50,309
I think one that wants to just it from

480
00:18:50,309 --> 00:18:52,350
the report that jumped out at me was I

481
00:18:52,350 --> 00:18:56,879
think a quarter of 27% of of the users

482
00:18:56,879 --> 00:18:58,019
said they just wouldn't find out about

483
00:18:58,019 --> 00:18:59,549
vulnerabilities they didn't have a way

484
00:18:59,549 --> 00:19:01,289
they find out about fun abilities and I

485
00:19:01,289 --> 00:19:05,309
think 17% of maintainer x' as well so

486
00:19:05,309 --> 00:19:07,889
given that I suppose I've mind my

487
00:19:07,889 --> 00:19:09,360
assumption is that people are filling

488
00:19:09,360 --> 00:19:10,950
out this pinning outlet surveys for this

489
00:19:10,950 --> 00:19:12,389
would have been relatively security

490
00:19:12,389 --> 00:19:13,320
minded because I suppose they're

491
00:19:13,320 --> 00:19:14,549
engaging with a survey from a scooter

492
00:19:14,549 --> 00:19:16,950
company I felt those those percentages

493
00:19:16,950 --> 00:19:19,559
were were slightly alarmingly high they

494
00:19:19,559 --> 00:19:21,690
had sort of no way they felt like they'd

495
00:19:21,690 --> 00:19:25,649
find out about our abilities meeting it

496
00:19:25,649 --> 00:19:29,009
the companies died so I'm you know

497
00:19:29,009 --> 00:19:30,360
obviously do you have a lot of

498
00:19:30,360 --> 00:19:31,830
experience chronic on the product side

499
00:19:31,830 --> 00:19:34,580
product managers that kind of area

500
00:19:34,580 --> 00:19:37,080
already knowing about these these known

501
00:19:37,080 --> 00:19:38,460
vulnerabilities that exist if you've

502
00:19:38,460 --> 00:19:40,230
more focus on the open source kind of

503
00:19:40,230 --> 00:19:42,059
site knowing about these run abilities

504
00:19:42,059 --> 00:19:43,769
what about the challenges or awareness

505
00:19:43,769 --> 00:19:45,480
of among the company and among the team

506
00:19:45,480 --> 00:19:48,090
in terms of dealing with archiving

507
00:19:48,090 --> 00:19:49,740
triaging any kind of application

508
00:19:49,740 --> 00:19:52,980
security issues as part of you know the

509
00:19:52,980 --> 00:19:56,070
the ownership and in the delivery of a

510
00:19:56,070 --> 00:19:58,110
library or project or an application how

511
00:19:58,110 --> 00:20:01,110
do you how do you see that bounce yeah

512
00:20:01,110 --> 00:20:03,269
actually we just hosted the container

513
00:20:03,269 --> 00:20:04,950
security summit here at Google a couple

514
00:20:04,950 --> 00:20:06,450
weeks ago and iam cold water was our

515
00:20:06,450 --> 00:20:09,240
closing keynote and her talk probably

516
00:20:09,240 --> 00:20:11,610
heard the breadth of her talks is one of

517
00:20:11,610 --> 00:20:13,830
her more less technical ones but it was

518
00:20:13,830 --> 00:20:15,149
so impactful because her whole point was

519
00:20:15,149 --> 00:20:17,220
that the best security tool you have is

520
00:20:17,220 --> 00:20:18,869
communication with your security teams

521
00:20:18,869 --> 00:20:22,619
and you know she's kind of the put it

522
00:20:22,619 --> 00:20:24,330
half on the security people were a

523
00:20:24,330 --> 00:20:28,799
little cranky we dress it all black and

524
00:20:28,799 --> 00:20:30,809
it scares off people who are in product

525
00:20:30,809 --> 00:20:33,779
people are you know does that you really

526
00:20:33,779 --> 00:20:34,649
need to have those lines of

527
00:20:34,649 --> 00:20:35,940
communication that needs to be your best

528
00:20:35,940 --> 00:20:37,889
friend essentially because you're a

529
00:20:37,889 --> 00:20:40,350
patched comes in when you know

530
00:20:40,350 --> 00:20:41,820
disclosure comes in those are the people

531
00:20:41,820 --> 00:20:43,649
who are probably seeing it first and

532
00:20:43,649 --> 00:20:45,480
that's how you're gonna find out that

533
00:20:45,480 --> 00:20:47,639
information is having that line stretch

534
00:20:47,639 --> 00:20:50,519
of those security teams I think Laureen

535
00:20:50,519 --> 00:20:51,869
you're mentioning about those shift less

536
00:20:51,869 --> 00:20:53,669
that's or maybe Josh was and I think

537
00:20:53,669 --> 00:20:54,350
that's something we should definitely

538
00:20:54,350 --> 00:20:57,360
dive into the difference between I think

539
00:20:57,360 --> 00:20:59,549
sometimes people in shifting left they

540
00:20:59,549 --> 00:21:02,129
are using responsibility on the

541
00:21:02,129 --> 00:21:04,320
developer interchangeably with moving

542
00:21:04,320 --> 00:21:05,730
security checks earlier in your

543
00:21:05,730 --> 00:21:07,679
development lifecycle I think those are

544
00:21:07,679 --> 00:21:10,110
two very different things and I think we

545
00:21:10,110 --> 00:21:11,610
have to be fair to our developers about

546
00:21:11,610 --> 00:21:14,159
expectations on you know am I asking you

547
00:21:14,159 --> 00:21:16,379
to be an expert in both my application

548
00:21:16,379 --> 00:21:18,990
and security that's a lot to put on on

549
00:21:18,990 --> 00:21:20,940
one team or am I just moving my checks

550
00:21:20,940 --> 00:21:23,009
earlier so I put those security guard

551
00:21:23,009 --> 00:21:25,080
rails in place and I think I just took

552
00:21:25,080 --> 00:21:28,200
your question all over the place this is

553
00:21:28,200 --> 00:21:29,580
really interesting particularly you know

554
00:21:29,580 --> 00:21:32,070
you mentioned communication which is

555
00:21:32,070 --> 00:21:34,080
incredibly important but it's equally

556
00:21:34,080 --> 00:21:35,460
the hot one of the hottest things right

557
00:21:35,460 --> 00:21:37,409
I mean we can we can add whatever tool

558
00:21:37,409 --> 00:21:38,909
and we can add whatever processes you

559
00:21:38,909 --> 00:21:40,590
want and things like that you know get

560
00:21:40,590 --> 00:21:42,059
followed but when it's literally one

561
00:21:42,059 --> 00:21:43,799
person and on you know maybe a few

562
00:21:43,799 --> 00:21:45,389
meters away from another person that

563
00:21:45,389 --> 00:21:47,940
sitting out an office you know their

564
00:21:47,940 --> 00:21:50,009
desks getting getting people eaten that

565
00:21:50,009 --> 00:21:52,320
close to communicate is hard it's it's

566
00:21:52,320 --> 00:21:54,299
it's not an easy thing and I guess this

567
00:21:54,299 --> 00:21:56,159
is why this is where the DevOps

568
00:21:56,159 --> 00:21:58,200
movements the dev Cyclops movements

569
00:21:58,200 --> 00:21:59,820
we're trying to engage people from

570
00:21:59,820 --> 00:22:01,409
different silos and getting them to talk

571
00:22:01,409 --> 00:22:03,950
is is really key to fixing this problem

572
00:22:03,950 --> 00:22:06,539
absolutely I mean it's I think for ever

573
00:22:06,539 --> 00:22:07,740
you know the relationship between

574
00:22:07,740 --> 00:22:09,419
security and devs the security people

575
00:22:09,419 --> 00:22:10,830
who say no

576
00:22:10,830 --> 00:22:12,540
they tell the developers please stop

577
00:22:12,540 --> 00:22:13,920
doing that don't do that and we have to

578
00:22:13,920 --> 00:22:15,690
kind of change the understanding in the

579
00:22:15,690 --> 00:22:17,070
conversation to be no I'm telling you

580
00:22:17,070 --> 00:22:18,960
not to do this you know for the benefit

581
00:22:18,960 --> 00:22:20,430
of this whole team the school

582
00:22:20,430 --> 00:22:25,230
organization oh sorry

583
00:22:25,230 --> 00:22:27,540
Josh I was gonna say I suppose I thought

584
00:22:27,540 --> 00:22:28,920
following on from that the idea really

585
00:22:28,920 --> 00:22:30,540
is that these security people coming in

586
00:22:30,540 --> 00:22:34,740
saying yes you can do that but let's try

587
00:22:34,740 --> 00:22:36,660
and find a way of making that more

588
00:22:36,660 --> 00:22:40,200
secure process or like it you know I can

589
00:22:40,200 --> 00:22:41,820
says is very much about not being

590
00:22:41,820 --> 00:22:43,440
Department of no and about Department of

591
00:22:43,440 --> 00:22:45,510
yes but let's still have a conversation

592
00:22:45,510 --> 00:22:47,790
about this again sorts of circles back

593
00:22:47,790 --> 00:22:52,320
to communication point if I'm on why

594
00:22:52,320 --> 00:22:53,850
don't you pull em on from the previous

595
00:22:53,850 --> 00:22:56,100
discussion which is actually pretty

596
00:22:56,100 --> 00:22:57,540
interesting as well so we'll go back to

597
00:22:57,540 --> 00:22:59,190
that one and then one about this current

598
00:22:59,190 --> 00:23:01,170
one so when we talked about the

599
00:23:01,170 --> 00:23:02,370
differences in open source a closed

600
00:23:02,370 --> 00:23:05,670
source is is there a downside of using

601
00:23:05,670 --> 00:23:10,020
open source software because once one

602
00:23:10,020 --> 00:23:11,160
ability is known your open source

603
00:23:11,160 --> 00:23:13,380
software there are obviously targets all

604
00:23:13,380 --> 00:23:18,360
around that are still using software

605
00:23:18,360 --> 00:23:20,400
versions with known vulnerabilities in

606
00:23:20,400 --> 00:23:24,150
other targets bigger as a result well I

607
00:23:24,150 --> 00:23:26,550
think this and sorry I'll maybe I'll

608
00:23:26,550 --> 00:23:28,230
start and Josh I'm sure you have heaps

609
00:23:28,230 --> 00:23:29,880
of opinions on this one as well um I

610
00:23:29,880 --> 00:23:31,470
think this goes to the importance of

611
00:23:31,470 --> 00:23:32,430
knowing where there's communication

612
00:23:32,430 --> 00:23:34,590
channels are I think there's not a lot

613
00:23:34,590 --> 00:23:36,180
of general understanding about how the

614
00:23:36,180 --> 00:23:38,160
open source disclosure and patching

615
00:23:38,160 --> 00:23:40,920
process works and so for example if you

616
00:23:40,920 --> 00:23:44,250
use a distro those distributions are on

617
00:23:44,250 --> 00:23:45,690
an embargoed list to give that patch

618
00:23:45,690 --> 00:23:48,390
early so you know if you're consuming

619
00:23:48,390 --> 00:23:49,590
something from industry you kind of have

620
00:23:49,590 --> 00:23:51,240
this shared responsibility model and

621
00:23:51,240 --> 00:23:54,120
it's it is on the user to understand is

622
00:23:54,120 --> 00:23:55,800
my district patching me do I need to be

623
00:23:55,800 --> 00:23:58,080
responsible for the patch and that gets

624
00:23:58,080 --> 00:24:00,180
to being on those lists understanding

625
00:24:00,180 --> 00:24:01,860
where those announcements come through

626
00:24:01,860 --> 00:24:05,190
but you have you have some time to patch

627
00:24:05,190 --> 00:24:07,080
right away but then if you let something

628
00:24:07,080 --> 00:24:09,210
go and you sit on it yes you do become I

629
00:24:09,210 --> 00:24:10,890
think that's one of the quickest things

630
00:24:10,890 --> 00:24:12,570
that you know talkers can look for is oh

631
00:24:12,570 --> 00:24:14,580
is there the Seavey's been out for a

632
00:24:14,580 --> 00:24:16,530
long time it's a previs core something

633
00:24:16,530 --> 00:24:18,690
you know that I can really get to I'm

634
00:24:18,690 --> 00:24:20,460
gonna go straight there it's it's kind

635
00:24:20,460 --> 00:24:23,220
of an easy target so that 27 percent in

636
00:24:23,220 --> 00:24:23,670
the report

637
00:24:23,670 --> 00:24:24,810
who are not getting information about

638
00:24:24,810 --> 00:24:27,150
vulnerabilities go go get on those

639
00:24:27,150 --> 00:24:30,690
security right away is it reasonable to

640
00:24:30,690 --> 00:24:32,850
jump on that many security burnable to

641
00:24:32,850 --> 00:24:34,500
kind of make this because you know we

642
00:24:34,500 --> 00:24:36,240
see people with hundreds and hundreds

643
00:24:36,240 --> 00:24:37,770
and hundreds of trying to tears and

644
00:24:37,770 --> 00:24:40,680
direct dependencies can we rely just on

645
00:24:40,680 --> 00:24:43,050
that you know I think actually that's

646
00:24:43,050 --> 00:24:44,970
the joy of this ecosystem that's come up

647
00:24:44,970 --> 00:24:47,130
around like snick is that there are a

648
00:24:47,130 --> 00:24:49,350
lot you know if I'm pulling in heaps of

649
00:24:49,350 --> 00:24:51,000
tools that and they all have open-source

650
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:52,620
announce list that is a lot to manage

651
00:24:52,620 --> 00:24:55,200
but we have this whole ecosystem like

652
00:24:55,200 --> 00:24:58,260
some tools like slick that are putting

653
00:24:58,260 --> 00:24:59,880
it in one place for you you also have

654
00:24:59,880 --> 00:25:02,960
things like Claire you know it's a CDE

655
00:25:02,960 --> 00:25:05,670
essentially a database of what's coming

656
00:25:05,670 --> 00:25:07,740
in through CDs so people can use that to

657
00:25:07,740 --> 00:25:09,510
scan against so there's a lot of tools

658
00:25:09,510 --> 00:25:10,770
to help you out you don't have to feel

659
00:25:10,770 --> 00:25:13,410
like I'm scanning through you know new

660
00:25:13,410 --> 00:25:15,290
email announce list every single day

661
00:25:15,290 --> 00:25:20,300
okay cool and one flock question as well

662
00:25:20,300 --> 00:25:22,860
around this is actually a DM that came

663
00:25:22,860 --> 00:25:26,300
in so Josh will talk we're talking about

664
00:25:26,300 --> 00:25:28,110
we're talking about you know the

665
00:25:28,110 --> 00:25:29,700
differences in communicate the hard the

666
00:25:29,700 --> 00:25:31,140
hard part of you know people

667
00:25:31,140 --> 00:25:32,580
communicating but communication being

668
00:25:32,580 --> 00:25:35,460
such an important thing when we have one

669
00:25:35,460 --> 00:25:37,290
we have separate communication oh sorry

670
00:25:37,290 --> 00:25:39,360
separate security teams obviously that's

671
00:25:39,360 --> 00:25:41,580
an extra level of communication not just

672
00:25:41,580 --> 00:25:43,680
within developers and we try to

673
00:25:43,680 --> 00:25:45,480
encourage say three times a day multiple

674
00:25:45,480 --> 00:25:46,980
times a day it's the flavor of the month

675
00:25:46,980 --> 00:25:48,240
all right how many times can you to play

676
00:25:48,240 --> 00:25:51,930
deploy a week or a day is having a

677
00:25:51,930 --> 00:25:53,940
separate security team still valid or is

678
00:25:53,940 --> 00:25:55,050
this just making the problem hard of

679
00:25:55,050 --> 00:25:57,660
course I think there's always gonna be a

680
00:25:57,660 --> 00:26:00,630
need for the security specialists or

681
00:26:00,630 --> 00:26:01,800
looking at the living and breathing that

682
00:26:01,800 --> 00:26:05,580
man definitely security is yes this

683
00:26:05,580 --> 00:26:06,810
whole this whole industry there's a lot

684
00:26:06,810 --> 00:26:09,150
going on all the time it's on the sign

685
00:26:09,150 --> 00:26:10,560
it's very difficult to just keep track

686
00:26:10,560 --> 00:26:13,980
of solve it as a site as a sidenote but

687
00:26:13,980 --> 00:26:14,910
at the same time I think it's very

688
00:26:14,910 --> 00:26:18,090
important to yeah firstly have the

689
00:26:18,090 --> 00:26:19,830
communication with the develop teams

690
00:26:19,830 --> 00:26:21,210
have the close wish that the development

691
00:26:21,210 --> 00:26:22,620
team is an ideally sort of identify who

692
00:26:22,620 --> 00:26:24,240
on development teams is more security

693
00:26:24,240 --> 00:26:27,450
minded and maybe able to act as liaison

694
00:26:27,450 --> 00:26:30,930
or as an ambassador for security within

695
00:26:30,930 --> 00:26:34,500
within the software group itself I've

696
00:26:34,500 --> 00:26:36,480
seen examples where

697
00:26:36,480 --> 00:26:39,600
the security people are I thought

698
00:26:39,600 --> 00:26:40,890
there's a skilled full-time security

699
00:26:40,890 --> 00:26:42,840
person but he reports to the manager of

700
00:26:42,840 --> 00:26:44,730
the our of the development team you'll

701
00:26:44,730 --> 00:26:48,780
sit in a separate security office or

702
00:26:48,780 --> 00:26:50,040
security harmony sits within the

703
00:26:50,040 --> 00:26:51,300
development team alongside developers

704
00:26:51,300 --> 00:26:54,810
beings a dedicated security person other

705
00:26:54,810 --> 00:26:57,320
another model is to have a security

706
00:26:57,320 --> 00:27:01,080
essential security body but each person

707
00:27:01,080 --> 00:27:02,370
has responsibility for a few products

708
00:27:02,370 --> 00:27:04,620
and they will therefore be the contact

709
00:27:04,620 --> 00:27:07,530
for those different products so I think

710
00:27:07,530 --> 00:27:09,330
it's again it's about how that

711
00:27:09,330 --> 00:27:10,680
communication happens and about how you

712
00:27:10,680 --> 00:27:13,140
identify who are the people who can

713
00:27:13,140 --> 00:27:15,750
really help so I was doing as as a sir

714
00:27:15,750 --> 00:27:17,310
commenting to internally at a company

715
00:27:17,310 --> 00:27:20,070
and identified that you know obviously

716
00:27:20,070 --> 00:27:21,810
QA was gonna be a big big part of this

717
00:27:21,810 --> 00:27:24,120
because if we want people to find bugs

718
00:27:24,120 --> 00:27:26,460
such as security bugs and QA to the

719
00:27:26,460 --> 00:27:27,690
place to start I've talked to the head

720
00:27:27,690 --> 00:27:29,040
of QA and I made sure I make time to

721
00:27:29,040 --> 00:27:30,540
speak to him and sort of talk to him

722
00:27:30,540 --> 00:27:31,560
about what I was planning on what I was

723
00:27:31,560 --> 00:27:33,750
thinking about and you know how I could

724
00:27:33,750 --> 00:27:36,690
help him if do security testing without

725
00:27:36,690 --> 00:27:38,250
making his job life more difficult and

726
00:27:38,250 --> 00:27:39,960
along the way so yeah I've got this guy

727
00:27:39,960 --> 00:27:41,940
on my team who really likes automated

728
00:27:41,940 --> 00:27:43,560
testing is also really interested in

729
00:27:43,560 --> 00:27:46,530
security as well so I think there's

730
00:27:46,530 --> 00:27:49,980
definitely the need for the security

731
00:27:49,980 --> 00:27:52,260
specialist but they can't exist in an

732
00:27:52,260 --> 00:27:53,670
ivory tower completely separately they

733
00:27:53,670 --> 00:27:55,710
have to have that it dart line into

734
00:27:55,710 --> 00:27:58,800
development teams as well I think this

735
00:27:58,800 --> 00:28:01,740
ties into kind of the whole cube left

736
00:28:01,740 --> 00:28:04,860
kind of think right because it's like if

737
00:28:04,860 --> 00:28:05,970
you think of security

738
00:28:05,970 --> 00:28:08,310
it's a cross-cutting concerns up the

739
00:28:08,310 --> 00:28:10,560
patient's right it just like performance

740
00:28:10,560 --> 00:28:11,970
and accessibility and stuff like that

741
00:28:11,970 --> 00:28:15,150
and it's kind of you know it's one of

742
00:28:15,150 --> 00:28:17,760
those things maybe one of maybe a more

743
00:28:17,760 --> 00:28:19,530
important thing you know depending on an

744
00:28:19,530 --> 00:28:22,290
opinions but each one of those things

745
00:28:22,290 --> 00:28:24,060
were like he's like an said before

746
00:28:24,060 --> 00:28:25,350
you're not gonna you know you're not

747
00:28:25,350 --> 00:28:27,510
gonna get developers to be you know the

748
00:28:27,510 --> 00:28:29,160
ultimate security expert as well as

749
00:28:29,160 --> 00:28:30,600
developers I mean if you have that from

750
00:28:30,600 --> 00:28:32,100
the team it's amazing but that's

751
00:28:32,100 --> 00:28:33,720
probably not gonna be you know what

752
00:28:33,720 --> 00:28:36,600
starts around everyone but still just

753
00:28:36,600 --> 00:28:38,850
having this awareness I think this is

754
00:28:38,850 --> 00:28:41,280
kind of what a shift left is all about

755
00:28:41,280 --> 00:28:42,780
from security as well it's kind of

756
00:28:42,780 --> 00:28:46,080
getting the awareness out so even if you

757
00:28:46,080 --> 00:28:48,000
have you know some kind of tooling you

758
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:49,920
know it's gonna go

759
00:28:49,920 --> 00:28:52,590
just you know that's at some point still

760
00:28:52,590 --> 00:28:56,490
and there are other aspects of it right

761
00:28:56,490 --> 00:28:59,100
like code reviews is something that you

762
00:28:59,100 --> 00:29:01,560
generally don't need tooling for or you

763
00:29:01,560 --> 00:29:03,690
know it could help but you it's enough

764
00:29:03,690 --> 00:29:05,790
to just have the awareness of it so just

765
00:29:05,790 --> 00:29:08,100
watching a code review between two

766
00:29:08,100 --> 00:29:09,720
developers you know talking about

767
00:29:09,720 --> 00:29:11,370
something and you know it's not just a

768
00:29:11,370 --> 00:29:13,560
functional kind of bug discussion it's

769
00:29:13,560 --> 00:29:15,660
also where well maybe this is something

770
00:29:15,660 --> 00:29:17,460
that's gonna get user input and you know

771
00:29:17,460 --> 00:29:18,960
could that be malicious should we trust

772
00:29:18,960 --> 00:29:20,070
it should we not what should we do about

773
00:29:20,070 --> 00:29:22,380
it there's a lot about awareness I think

774
00:29:22,380 --> 00:29:23,550
that goes in there

775
00:29:23,550 --> 00:29:26,400
that is as far as I see it the moment

776
00:29:26,400 --> 00:29:27,600
that developers are asking those

777
00:29:27,600 --> 00:29:29,820
questions that's for me it's like 50%

778
00:29:29,820 --> 00:29:32,940
win because at that point I know that

779
00:29:32,940 --> 00:29:34,740
they're gonna be pretty much aware for

780
00:29:34,740 --> 00:29:36,180
it they're gonna be very much committed

781
00:29:36,180 --> 00:29:38,730
to it and they want to be secure they

782
00:29:38,730 --> 00:29:41,010
want to you know they want to have you

783
00:29:41,010 --> 00:29:43,080
know these kind of ownership and and you

784
00:29:43,080 --> 00:29:44,430
know it's not gonna say that they're

785
00:29:44,430 --> 00:29:46,110
gonna own the tools and connect

786
00:29:46,110 --> 00:29:47,160
everything it's a try and be the

787
00:29:47,160 --> 00:29:50,280
security expert for it but it's a very

788
00:29:50,280 --> 00:29:53,250
long way I think from from the from the

789
00:29:53,250 --> 00:29:55,470
cannot being aware of it at all not

790
00:29:55,470 --> 00:30:00,960
taking any kind of ownership for it so I

791
00:30:00,960 --> 00:30:03,660
was really surprised by that 81% say the

792
00:30:03,660 --> 00:30:05,310
responsibility on developers I thought

793
00:30:05,310 --> 00:30:07,680
that was astonishingly high I just

794
00:30:07,680 --> 00:30:09,870
assumed it'd been a lot of fun no DevOps

795
00:30:09,870 --> 00:30:11,970
people or vote managers or something who

796
00:30:11,970 --> 00:30:13,350
felt like okay I'll just put it on the

797
00:30:13,350 --> 00:30:17,070
developers I thought that was really I

798
00:30:17,070 --> 00:30:19,590
think they were talked about shift left

799
00:30:19,590 --> 00:30:21,000
it's not something you're thinking maybe

800
00:30:21,000 --> 00:30:23,010
that it's more about spreading left

801
00:30:23,010 --> 00:30:24,330
rather than shifting that because we

802
00:30:24,330 --> 00:30:26,100
want security every stage not just at a

803
00:30:26,100 --> 00:30:29,390
particular stage you know ultimately I

804
00:30:29,390 --> 00:30:32,820
said 81% figure is very strange I think

805
00:30:32,820 --> 00:30:36,030
that if security isn't everyone's job

806
00:30:36,030 --> 00:30:38,460
but it doesn't need to be able to I need

807
00:30:38,460 --> 00:30:40,110
to have some responsibility for it and

808
00:30:40,110 --> 00:30:41,280
they need to have some sort of awareness

809
00:30:41,280 --> 00:30:42,480
of it and that will come from the

810
00:30:42,480 --> 00:30:44,040
architect from the developers from the

811
00:30:44,040 --> 00:30:47,100
QA from the DevOps people that come all

812
00:30:47,100 --> 00:30:48,890
the way all the way through the chain

813
00:30:48,890 --> 00:30:51,210
and I think it's immune maybe the

814
00:30:51,210 --> 00:30:52,890
concept of shifting left is about saying

815
00:30:52,890 --> 00:30:55,470
okay well this is now a concern at every

816
00:30:55,470 --> 00:30:58,200
stage of the process and therefore what

817
00:30:58,200 --> 00:30:59,430
everyone needs to be thinking about it

818
00:30:59,430 --> 00:31:01,200
and if the developer says oh I've got

819
00:31:01,200 --> 00:31:03,030
the security bug they need to do to deal

820
00:31:03,030 --> 00:31:03,809
with or

821
00:31:03,809 --> 00:31:05,009
I've got this particular problem where I

822
00:31:05,009 --> 00:31:06,299
need a security architect to look at

823
00:31:06,299 --> 00:31:07,080
this feature because it's quite

824
00:31:07,080 --> 00:31:09,690
dangerous then once we know that okay

825
00:31:09,690 --> 00:31:11,789
security is now covering every stage of

826
00:31:11,789 --> 00:31:13,769
the lifecycle developers more like to

827
00:31:13,769 --> 00:31:15,570
have that by intercept to get permission

828
00:31:15,570 --> 00:31:17,609
see yes you can now go and spend two

829
00:31:17,609 --> 00:31:19,049
days working on this or you can engage a

830
00:31:19,049 --> 00:31:22,109
security architect to look at this so I

831
00:31:22,109 --> 00:31:24,450
think that's really sort of where we're

832
00:31:24,450 --> 00:31:26,399
shift left has to has to County to

833
00:31:26,399 --> 00:31:29,549
spread it across the entire process and

834
00:31:29,549 --> 00:31:31,169
I think Josh you were talking about the

835
00:31:31,169 --> 00:31:33,090
from security that answers not know but

836
00:31:33,090 --> 00:31:34,469
it's yes and and I think we have to

837
00:31:34,469 --> 00:31:36,239
encourage our developers to look at

838
00:31:36,239 --> 00:31:39,059
their security tools the same way so for

839
00:31:39,059 --> 00:31:40,739
example like on Google cloud we have

840
00:31:40,739 --> 00:31:42,479
this tool called binary relation and

841
00:31:42,479 --> 00:31:44,879
it's essentially deploy time gating you

842
00:31:44,879 --> 00:31:46,109
know based on parameters that your

843
00:31:46,109 --> 00:31:48,419
organization has decided for you so for

844
00:31:48,419 --> 00:31:49,950
some reason by an auth where you say

845
00:31:49,950 --> 00:31:51,960
nope you can't do that it's it should be

846
00:31:51,960 --> 00:31:53,519
looked at as you know for the developer

847
00:31:53,519 --> 00:31:55,440
this is a flag this is a good morning

848
00:31:55,440 --> 00:31:57,509
this is not frustration this is not know

849
00:31:57,509 --> 00:31:59,909
this is something is up and I need to I

850
00:31:59,909 --> 00:32:02,129
need to take a look you know I think

851
00:32:02,129 --> 00:32:04,399
kind of I see a lot when you look at

852
00:32:04,399 --> 00:32:07,349
what is the the one of the second most

853
00:32:07,349 --> 00:32:08,549
searched things when you search for SEO

854
00:32:08,549 --> 00:32:10,750
Linux is how do I turn selinux off

855
00:32:10,750 --> 00:32:16,549
[Laughter]

856
00:32:16,549 --> 00:32:19,139
people are not looking for oh this is a

857
00:32:19,139 --> 00:32:20,969
warning I should be saying what's up

858
00:32:20,969 --> 00:32:22,769
it's how do I get rid of this as quickly

859
00:32:22,769 --> 00:32:24,539
as well so I think I need to have the

860
00:32:24,539 --> 00:32:26,639
same open mindset to tools whether it's

861
00:32:26,639 --> 00:32:28,080
you know results I'm seeing and scanning

862
00:32:28,080 --> 00:32:30,899
or something to like been off these are

863
00:32:30,899 --> 00:32:32,899
our friends this tooling is our friend

864
00:32:32,899 --> 00:32:36,839
and the number the number the 81% that

865
00:32:36,839 --> 00:32:39,679
we mentioned that shift that so that

866
00:32:39,679 --> 00:32:42,359
that number is - a multi multiple choice

867
00:32:42,359 --> 00:32:44,519
question and that people chose

868
00:32:44,519 --> 00:32:46,469
developers more than any other answer

869
00:32:46,469 --> 00:32:49,109
put together which was which was really

870
00:32:49,109 --> 00:32:51,509
interesting so from from the shift left

871
00:32:51,509 --> 00:32:54,119
point of view I mean Lorraine you're a

872
00:32:54,119 --> 00:32:56,219
developer you're right you know you're

873
00:32:56,219 --> 00:32:58,200
an application developer you also write

874
00:32:58,200 --> 00:33:02,190
note what when we think about when we

875
00:33:02,190 --> 00:33:03,869
think about shifting left are we

876
00:33:03,869 --> 00:33:05,309
actually just pushing too much onto a

877
00:33:05,309 --> 00:33:06,690
developer how much more kind of

878
00:33:06,690 --> 00:33:08,369
developer take their doing I remember

879
00:33:08,369 --> 00:33:10,139
when I started it was people worked and

880
00:33:10,139 --> 00:33:11,580
development people works and tests big

881
00:33:11,580 --> 00:33:12,869
work operations people works and

882
00:33:12,869 --> 00:33:15,029
security right now developers are doing

883
00:33:15,029 --> 00:33:16,320
more and more unit tests more more

884
00:33:16,320 --> 00:33:17,549
functional tests more

885
00:33:17,549 --> 00:33:19,559
the you know operations and chatting

886
00:33:19,559 --> 00:33:21,960
encode instructress code now doing more

887
00:33:21,960 --> 00:33:24,299
and more security let is it stock will

888
00:33:24,299 --> 00:33:26,450
be putting too much on to developers

889
00:33:26,450 --> 00:33:29,570
where's the break for the developer

890
00:33:29,570 --> 00:33:32,340
right so uh so someone when you do know

891
00:33:32,340 --> 00:33:34,559
it's very easy so as opposed to Java for

892
00:33:34,559 --> 00:33:37,019
example you know it gives you a lot of

893
00:33:37,019 --> 00:33:39,929
spare time to do performance and those

894
00:33:39,929 --> 00:33:46,440
things alright cool so I think it's so

895
00:33:46,440 --> 00:33:48,119
it's a good question right because you

896
00:33:48,119 --> 00:33:49,710
keep it outside exactly about all these

897
00:33:49,710 --> 00:33:50,820
other cutting concerns and all the

898
00:33:50,820 --> 00:33:53,700
examples that you gave and I think in

899
00:33:53,700 --> 00:33:55,859
general the idea is that we're also

900
00:33:55,859 --> 00:33:58,739
having a lot of awareness around it but

901
00:33:58,739 --> 00:34:02,309
then tooling that helps us and and you

902
00:34:02,309 --> 00:34:04,529
know it's there's AI think developers

903
00:34:04,529 --> 00:34:06,179
want to do the right thing and build it

904
00:34:06,179 --> 00:34:09,960
the right way and you know this goes a

905
00:34:09,960 --> 00:34:12,299
long way into giving them educating them

906
00:34:12,299 --> 00:34:14,010
into how to do things so if you would

907
00:34:14,010 --> 00:34:15,839
put if you would give developers you

908
00:34:15,839 --> 00:34:17,460
know this is a secure coding guidelines

909
00:34:17,460 --> 00:34:19,679
no I think they would want to follow it

910
00:34:19,679 --> 00:34:21,210
and not say you know I don't have time

911
00:34:21,210 --> 00:34:24,239
to do this and I think that as we are

912
00:34:24,239 --> 00:34:27,510
going into delivering in a very very

913
00:34:27,510 --> 00:34:29,790
fast way and you know delivering value

914
00:34:29,790 --> 00:34:32,000
to our customers and delivering products

915
00:34:32,000 --> 00:34:35,760
very fast which is important you know to

916
00:34:35,760 --> 00:34:36,839
the business or you know whatever

917
00:34:36,839 --> 00:34:39,929
basically you're doing on it's also

918
00:34:39,929 --> 00:34:42,569
important to not let go of quality and

919
00:34:42,569 --> 00:34:45,210
all it is not just testing is it's also

920
00:34:45,210 --> 00:34:47,879
security it's also other aspect of the

921
00:34:47,879 --> 00:34:50,369
apps so it's I don't think it's

922
00:34:50,369 --> 00:34:52,469
something that you know is requiring a

923
00:34:52,469 --> 00:34:54,780
lot too much of them I think it's

924
00:34:54,780 --> 00:34:57,119
requiring their attention in general for

925
00:34:57,119 --> 00:34:58,950
developers to do it because like I think

926
00:34:58,950 --> 00:35:01,440
like and Josh said before we're gonna

927
00:35:01,440 --> 00:35:02,670
have security teams there are we're

928
00:35:02,670 --> 00:35:03,930
gonna have security experts that we can

929
00:35:03,930 --> 00:35:05,970
consult with and you know just like you

930
00:35:05,970 --> 00:35:08,099
have an architect for general you know

931
00:35:08,099 --> 00:35:09,559
software design you would have that for

932
00:35:09,559 --> 00:35:12,240
for for security and maybe for some

933
00:35:12,240 --> 00:35:13,770
organization for performance that would

934
00:35:13,770 --> 00:35:16,680
be tech leads for security so I don't

935
00:35:16,680 --> 00:35:18,569
think you know everyone on the team has

936
00:35:18,569 --> 00:35:21,480
to be you know 120 percent knowledgeable

937
00:35:21,480 --> 00:35:25,530
on security aspects but usually you do

938
00:35:25,530 --> 00:35:27,270
have those tech leads on you know

939
00:35:27,270 --> 00:35:29,490
development teams one is a very you know

940
00:35:29,490 --> 00:35:31,380
you know UI tech lead

941
00:35:31,380 --> 00:35:32,970
reinterred so he would know a lot about

942
00:35:32,970 --> 00:35:35,250
performance optimization and stuff like

943
00:35:35,250 --> 00:35:37,950
that you know someone else might be a

944
00:35:37,950 --> 00:35:39,750
security tech laid around you know for

945
00:35:39,750 --> 00:35:42,000
that whole team and he could be someone

946
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:43,890
who would mentor other other team

947
00:35:43,890 --> 00:35:45,390
members and you know be involved in code

948
00:35:45,390 --> 00:35:47,339
reviews so I think it's kind of a shared

949
00:35:47,339 --> 00:35:50,220
effort throughout developed for timpz

950
00:35:50,220 --> 00:35:53,670
and i think it's it's an amazing kind of

951
00:35:53,670 --> 00:35:56,940
incubation part where you know also team

952
00:35:56,940 --> 00:35:59,279
members you know or tech ladies and

953
00:35:59,279 --> 00:36:01,710
seniors and juniors kind of mentor each

954
00:36:01,710 --> 00:36:04,500
other you know incur that knowledge so I

955
00:36:04,500 --> 00:36:06,900
think that'sthat's pretty reasonable

956
00:36:06,900 --> 00:36:09,059
asks and it's a great there's a great

957
00:36:09,059 --> 00:36:11,039
point has just been made in in a live

958
00:36:11,039 --> 00:36:13,140
session from Mark Stevenson so please

959
00:36:13,140 --> 00:36:15,210
don't comment or questions do you jump

960
00:36:15,210 --> 00:36:17,099
into the live session mark says that's

961
00:36:17,099 --> 00:36:18,059
interesting but if you're a small

962
00:36:18,059 --> 00:36:20,250
company the developer has to wear many

963
00:36:20,250 --> 00:36:21,839
hats right and maybe there isn't a

964
00:36:21,839 --> 00:36:24,119
dedicated security team plus to add to

965
00:36:24,119 --> 00:36:26,220
that question I would say you're often

966
00:36:26,220 --> 00:36:27,750
with the smaller companies more likely

967
00:36:27,750 --> 00:36:29,519
to release more often perhaps you know

968
00:36:29,519 --> 00:36:31,589
then some of the bigger companies that

969
00:36:31,589 --> 00:36:33,089
are maybe more traditional in terms of

970
00:36:33,089 --> 00:36:36,299
that their deployment flow any from the

971
00:36:36,299 --> 00:36:38,039
panel anyone one I want to add into that

972
00:36:38,039 --> 00:36:41,609
I would say I think that's where you're

973
00:36:41,609 --> 00:36:43,019
probably leaning on some of your

974
00:36:43,019 --> 00:36:45,359
automated security tooling heavier than

975
00:36:45,359 --> 00:36:48,960
in other places you know you're yeah

976
00:36:48,960 --> 00:36:50,009
we've refreshed um you know even putting

977
00:36:50,009 --> 00:36:51,960
in scanners I'm putting in gaining tools

978
00:36:51,960 --> 00:36:53,390
like the not that I was talking about

979
00:36:53,390 --> 00:36:55,730
you know if you know if you don't have

980
00:36:55,730 --> 00:36:58,259
many actual hands you have to kind of

981
00:36:58,259 --> 00:37:02,910
have those automated hands I'm staying

982
00:37:02,910 --> 00:37:04,980
with you there's a product that you work

983
00:37:04,980 --> 00:37:07,680
on cool I may say this wrong is it cater

984
00:37:07,680 --> 00:37:10,309
or Carter cutter

985
00:37:10,309 --> 00:37:17,069
of course I was just hoping it yeah

986
00:37:17,069 --> 00:37:18,869
that's right so the cards containers

987
00:37:18,869 --> 00:37:21,240
project give us a little bit about what

988
00:37:21,240 --> 00:37:23,579
that is and how and how that helps

989
00:37:23,579 --> 00:37:26,009
people find you know understand about

990
00:37:26,009 --> 00:37:27,839
their new security issues as early as

991
00:37:27,839 --> 00:37:28,230
possible

992
00:37:28,230 --> 00:37:30,150
and also week so do you get if you win

993
00:37:30,150 --> 00:37:34,680
Decatur the cut out well I'll explain

994
00:37:34,680 --> 00:37:36,210
kind of containers and maybe I confused

995
00:37:36,210 --> 00:37:37,710
you with some of the other tooling we

996
00:37:37,710 --> 00:37:39,480
have so kind of containers is an open

997
00:37:39,480 --> 00:37:42,599
source project it was started by Intel

998
00:37:42,599 --> 00:37:43,589
and hi

999
00:37:43,589 --> 00:37:45,650
4sh typers has started about in China

1000
00:37:45,650 --> 00:37:47,969
until had clear containers and they were

1001
00:37:47,969 --> 00:37:49,229
both kind of looking at virtualized

1002
00:37:49,229 --> 00:37:52,259
containers so how can I add a second

1003
00:37:52,259 --> 00:37:54,329
layer of isolation you know I think the

1004
00:37:54,329 --> 00:37:56,940
mistake from technically my titles and

1005
00:37:56,940 --> 00:37:58,349
marketing so marketer here the mistake

1006
00:37:58,349 --> 00:38:00,150
container world is made is was using all

1007
00:38:00,150 --> 00:38:02,190
those images of shipping containers and

1008
00:38:02,190 --> 00:38:03,779
really telling people that you know

1009
00:38:03,779 --> 00:38:05,880
containers really contain everything's

1010
00:38:05,880 --> 00:38:09,180
fine I think we may be oversold a little

1011
00:38:09,180 --> 00:38:10,769
bit what that containment really means

1012
00:38:10,769 --> 00:38:12,869
and so there's a big movement and

1013
00:38:12,869 --> 00:38:14,339
contain the container security world

1014
00:38:14,339 --> 00:38:16,650
around isolation so how can I have

1015
00:38:16,650 --> 00:38:18,210
defense and depth how can I have more

1016
00:38:18,210 --> 00:38:20,009
than just relying on my namespaces and

1017
00:38:20,009 --> 00:38:21,989
see groups to isolate those workloads

1018
00:38:21,989 --> 00:38:24,269
socata containers is essentially putting

1019
00:38:24,269 --> 00:38:27,210
a lightweight VM around your container

1020
00:38:27,210 --> 00:38:29,089
through their own runtime that they have

1021
00:38:29,089 --> 00:38:32,400
and so it's OCI compliant runtime and

1022
00:38:32,400 --> 00:38:34,829
that micro VM approach is one thing you

1023
00:38:34,829 --> 00:38:37,289
see like AWS firecracker kind of come

1024
00:38:37,289 --> 00:38:38,460
out with that my chromium approach

1025
00:38:38,460 --> 00:38:41,039
there's another open-source project out

1026
00:38:41,039 --> 00:38:43,619
of Google called G visor and rather than

1027
00:38:43,619 --> 00:38:45,900
going in micro VM they're looking at how

1028
00:38:45,900 --> 00:38:49,559
can I support kind of low i/o but highly

1029
00:38:49,559 --> 00:38:52,859
scaled applications who maybe don't need

1030
00:38:52,859 --> 00:38:54,779
that micro VM approach and so but

1031
00:38:54,779 --> 00:38:55,710
they're actually do they have a user

1032
00:38:55,710 --> 00:38:58,829
space kernel that's got kind of sets a

1033
00:38:58,829 --> 00:39:01,680
set suite of syscalls that a can and

1034
00:39:01,680 --> 00:39:03,479
can't have and so that's why you can

1035
00:39:03,479 --> 00:39:05,160
have kind of that rapid performance but

1036
00:39:05,160 --> 00:39:08,099
get a second layer of isolation so

1037
00:39:08,099 --> 00:39:09,119
there's a lot happening that space

1038
00:39:09,119 --> 00:39:12,059
there's also Noblet containers so a lot

1039
00:39:12,059 --> 00:39:13,440
a lot of people experimenting in the

1040
00:39:13,440 --> 00:39:14,789
open source world with isolation right

1041
00:39:14,789 --> 00:39:17,729
now and so in terms of the from the

1042
00:39:17,729 --> 00:39:21,420
open-source maintainer point of view one

1043
00:39:21,420 --> 00:39:22,680
of the biggest wins for an open source

1044
00:39:22,680 --> 00:39:26,910
maintained if you're using these I think

1045
00:39:26,910 --> 00:39:28,380
for a maintainer it's really they're

1046
00:39:28,380 --> 00:39:32,400
much more end-user products so you know

1047
00:39:32,400 --> 00:39:34,979
if you are a maintainer you could be

1048
00:39:34,979 --> 00:39:37,259
running your applications in them

1049
00:39:37,259 --> 00:39:38,519
you know looking at them if I want to

1050
00:39:38,519 --> 00:39:40,229
secure my projects that I'm posting

1051
00:39:40,229 --> 00:39:42,210
somewhere but they're much more end-user

1052
00:39:42,210 --> 00:39:46,859
results okay oh cool and when we talk

1053
00:39:46,859 --> 00:39:48,329
about other containers would be the

1054
00:39:48,329 --> 00:39:51,479
report found Leron that the top 10 most

1055
00:39:51,479 --> 00:39:53,609
popular docker images containing at

1056
00:39:53,609 --> 00:39:56,890
least 30 vulnerabilities and

1057
00:39:56,890 --> 00:39:58,120
and no it was the clear winner on that

1058
00:39:58,120 --> 00:40:01,870
one there are what we're that surprising

1059
00:40:01,870 --> 00:40:04,480
to you with is this is this in this kind

1060
00:40:04,480 --> 00:40:06,640
of like something that people tend not

1061
00:40:06,640 --> 00:40:08,170
to realize when they're using containers

1062
00:40:08,170 --> 00:40:10,870
what what's the what's the story with

1063
00:40:10,870 --> 00:40:17,230
this yeah I think it's uh yes so it had

1064
00:40:17,230 --> 00:40:20,070
a considerably large amount of

1065
00:40:20,070 --> 00:40:22,540
vulnerabilities inside something like

1066
00:40:22,540 --> 00:40:25,960
580 it's not the number right as opposed

1067
00:40:25,960 --> 00:40:27,120
to the others

1068
00:40:27,120 --> 00:40:30,070
so I actually think that we fixed that

1069
00:40:30,070 --> 00:40:32,290
on the node Foundation side and using

1070
00:40:32,290 --> 00:40:34,570
now a different image at least there's a

1071
00:40:34,570 --> 00:40:36,100
whole discussion around that on the

1072
00:40:36,100 --> 00:40:40,330
issue queue but even regard the girlís

1073
00:40:40,330 --> 00:40:42,720
said I think there's a lot of

1074
00:40:42,720 --> 00:40:45,510
misconception or you know just maybe

1075
00:40:45,510 --> 00:40:48,430
lack of knowledge where people might be

1076
00:40:48,430 --> 00:40:50,410
doing I know what's you know for myself

1077
00:40:50,410 --> 00:40:52,450
before I went into snake it was a you

1078
00:40:52,450 --> 00:40:54,310
know developer and a team leader and you

1079
00:40:54,310 --> 00:40:56,110
know my team also had maintained to run

1080
00:40:56,110 --> 00:40:57,640
docker file and stuff like that and we

1081
00:40:57,640 --> 00:41:00,820
used to do you know from you know node :

1082
00:41:00,820 --> 00:41:03,250
10 etc and you know the classic examples

1083
00:41:03,250 --> 00:41:06,250
were building on you know our app on

1084
00:41:06,250 --> 00:41:08,050
foundation of some some kind of a waste

1085
00:41:08,050 --> 00:41:10,840
or or distribution but we didn't you

1086
00:41:10,840 --> 00:41:14,020
know didn't even had this you know kind

1087
00:41:14,020 --> 00:41:16,360
of this awareness into what we are

1088
00:41:16,360 --> 00:41:19,330
bringing in with ourselves and I think

1089
00:41:19,330 --> 00:41:21,880
that this is something that we we talk a

1090
00:41:21,880 --> 00:41:24,130
lot in terms of video stuck over for the

1091
00:41:24,130 --> 00:41:25,720
stock overflow problem where people go

1092
00:41:25,720 --> 00:41:27,220
in they you know they copy paste you

1093
00:41:27,220 --> 00:41:29,890
know from node N or some other kind of

1094
00:41:29,890 --> 00:41:31,890
vulnerable code and you know it works

1095
00:41:31,890 --> 00:41:34,270
but there's there's no you know deeper

1096
00:41:34,270 --> 00:41:37,360
understanding into what what exactly is

1097
00:41:37,360 --> 00:41:39,460
it doing or you know what exactly are

1098
00:41:39,460 --> 00:41:42,580
the risk of doing something that way so

1099
00:41:42,580 --> 00:41:45,460
I think it's easy for for teams to make

1100
00:41:45,460 --> 00:41:47,020
those kind of mistakes as they think

1101
00:41:47,020 --> 00:41:49,540
like that the deeper knowledge into into

1102
00:41:49,540 --> 00:41:51,670
what goes into that I think maybe an

1103
00:41:51,670 --> 00:41:53,680
wants to the jump on it says I think

1104
00:41:53,680 --> 00:42:01,210
she's nodding in yeah I think what's at

1105
00:42:01,210 --> 00:42:05,590
2000 17 or 18 kind of this you know this

1106
00:42:05,590 --> 00:42:07,720
crypto mining docker images that we saw

1107
00:42:07,720 --> 00:42:10,250
um you know I think there's this

1108
00:42:10,250 --> 00:42:12,500
assumption all most people are too too

1109
00:42:12,500 --> 00:42:14,210
trusting sometimes of I pulled this from

1110
00:42:14,210 --> 00:42:16,580
docker hub it must be fine it must be ok

1111
00:42:16,580 --> 00:42:19,370
and I think you have to you know as an

1112
00:42:19,370 --> 00:42:20,840
organization kind of established a

1113
00:42:20,840 --> 00:42:23,330
definition of trust of whose images are

1114
00:42:23,330 --> 00:42:26,150
we going to trust you can kind of have

1115
00:42:26,150 --> 00:42:28,250
your own rules of I I trust things from

1116
00:42:28,250 --> 00:42:29,690
Netflix I trust things from Google I'd

1117
00:42:29,690 --> 00:42:32,330
you know things certain developers that

1118
00:42:32,330 --> 00:42:34,730
I know through the community having

1119
00:42:34,730 --> 00:42:36,050
those definitions of trust versus I

1120
00:42:36,050 --> 00:42:37,670
pulled this because it was from user

1121
00:42:37,670 --> 00:42:42,170
abc123 sounds good and then once you you

1122
00:42:42,170 --> 00:42:43,880
know after you that where are you what

1123
00:42:43,880 --> 00:42:44,930
are the sets of checks that you're gonna

1124
00:42:44,930 --> 00:42:46,670
put in place to establish that trust are

1125
00:42:46,670 --> 00:42:48,530
you gonna do scanning are you you know

1126
00:42:48,530 --> 00:42:50,270
what are you having to make sure that

1127
00:42:50,270 --> 00:42:52,240
the play time also this image wasn't

1128
00:42:52,240 --> 00:42:54,230
tampered with between the time you

1129
00:42:54,230 --> 00:42:56,330
pulled it in the play time and so I

1130
00:42:56,330 --> 00:42:57,470
think that's one of the big things

1131
00:42:57,470 --> 00:43:01,130
around the growth of open-source is that

1132
00:43:01,130 --> 00:43:03,920
you get a lot more contributions but you

1133
00:43:03,920 --> 00:43:06,170
need to start looking at where are they

1134
00:43:06,170 --> 00:43:07,430
coming from and what are they and do I

1135
00:43:07,430 --> 00:43:10,370
trust them and with docker images in

1136
00:43:10,370 --> 00:43:11,780
particular I know

1137
00:43:11,780 --> 00:43:13,880
Dirk kondal from VMware he's the head of

1138
00:43:13,880 --> 00:43:14,840
open-source there

1139
00:43:14,840 --> 00:43:16,760
he's really been pushing the turn

1140
00:43:16,760 --> 00:43:18,170
project because one of the other things

1141
00:43:18,170 --> 00:43:20,630
is that images can pull other images

1142
00:43:20,630 --> 00:43:21,980
that can pull other images so you can

1143
00:43:21,980 --> 00:43:23,630
kind of have a chain both from a

1144
00:43:23,630 --> 00:43:24,950
licensing perspective but also a

1145
00:43:24,950 --> 00:43:26,680
potentially vulnerability perspective

1146
00:43:26,680 --> 00:43:33,260
and so it Bob Lowe yeah and in terms of

1147
00:43:33,260 --> 00:43:35,600
whether fix where the fix should exist

1148
00:43:35,600 --> 00:43:37,160
that is at the maintain is that that

1149
00:43:37,160 --> 00:43:39,410
should be more careful about which you

1150
00:43:39,410 --> 00:43:41,150
know whose other containers they pull in

1151
00:43:41,150 --> 00:43:43,490
or other layers that they put in is it

1152
00:43:43,490 --> 00:43:44,960
the user that needs to be careful about

1153
00:43:44,960 --> 00:43:47,060
you know who they who they win and which

1154
00:43:47,060 --> 00:43:48,770
images they say you mentioned about that

1155
00:43:48,770 --> 00:43:50,390
the publisher for example which is a

1156
00:43:50,390 --> 00:43:52,070
little bit easier perhaps on docker than

1157
00:43:52,070 --> 00:43:53,690
it is maybe something like you're

1158
00:43:53,690 --> 00:43:55,700
looking for a package on an application

1159
00:43:55,700 --> 00:43:57,380
repository or something like that where

1160
00:43:57,380 --> 00:43:58,940
is that whether the fixes lie or is it

1161
00:43:58,940 --> 00:44:01,370
kind of across from multiple places and

1162
00:44:01,370 --> 00:44:02,810
we need in some ways it is across

1163
00:44:02,810 --> 00:44:04,820
multiple places we often end of do our

1164
00:44:04,820 --> 00:44:07,280
best effort but I think at the end of

1165
00:44:07,280 --> 00:44:10,340
the day for this one it does sit in back

1166
00:44:10,340 --> 00:44:11,750
to that shift left in the developer and

1167
00:44:11,750 --> 00:44:13,340
putting the security checks in place of

1168
00:44:13,340 --> 00:44:14,480
you know if you're gonna pull something

1169
00:44:14,480 --> 00:44:16,610
in you need to have a process to

1170
00:44:16,610 --> 00:44:18,770
establish how why you did that in a high

1171
00:44:18,770 --> 00:44:23,210
trust it I really like this going into

1172
00:44:23,210 --> 00:44:23,720
this

1173
00:44:23,720 --> 00:44:25,430
supply chain attacks go ahead Josh

1174
00:44:25,430 --> 00:44:26,810
because I think we have a lot of stuff

1175
00:44:26,810 --> 00:44:28,190
to say and it's yeah I wasn't gonna

1176
00:44:28,190 --> 00:44:29,660
carry on supply chain attacks because I

1177
00:44:29,660 --> 00:44:31,760
think it's it's it's it's a really

1178
00:44:31,760 --> 00:44:32,810
interesting problem is very difficult

1179
00:44:32,810 --> 00:44:34,579
problem I mean in terms of whose

1180
00:44:34,579 --> 00:44:36,650
responsibility is it I think like Anne

1181
00:44:36,650 --> 00:44:38,030
says it has to come back to develop an

1182
00:44:38,030 --> 00:44:39,680
organization you can't necessarily rely

1183
00:44:39,680 --> 00:44:41,089
that someone upstream is gonna worry

1184
00:44:41,089 --> 00:44:43,880
about this I mean look it was at the

1185
00:44:43,880 --> 00:44:47,540
events tree an example exactly it was

1186
00:44:47,540 --> 00:44:50,420
because it was a sub library of a sub

1187
00:44:50,420 --> 00:44:51,770
library or something where the

1188
00:44:51,770 --> 00:44:53,030
maintainer just sort of got bored and

1189
00:44:53,030 --> 00:44:56,420
maintaining it someone else in mo can I

1190
00:44:56,420 --> 00:44:57,770
take over maintenance of this packages

1191
00:44:57,770 --> 00:44:59,000
like oh yeah sure I can border this

1192
00:44:59,000 --> 00:44:59,420
anymore

1193
00:44:59,420 --> 00:45:01,250
transfer to transferred over ownership

1194
00:45:01,250 --> 00:45:04,190
of the package and then suddenly when it

1195
00:45:04,190 --> 00:45:05,300
was discovered he something got a lot of

1196
00:45:05,300 --> 00:45:06,560
heating inside look I'm not being paid

1197
00:45:06,560 --> 00:45:08,839
for this this is my hobby I got bored of

1198
00:45:08,839 --> 00:45:11,480
this this guy have been doing you had

1199
00:45:11,480 --> 00:45:13,869
been submitting patches whatever to this

1200
00:45:13,869 --> 00:45:15,589
library so didn't see a problem in

1201
00:45:15,589 --> 00:45:17,750
transferring over ownership to him yeah

1202
00:45:17,750 --> 00:45:20,599
and you can say oh it was irresponsible

1203
00:45:20,599 --> 00:45:23,079
to transfer though ownership but again

1204
00:45:23,079 --> 00:45:26,450
what what no the guy wasn't being paid

1205
00:45:26,450 --> 00:45:28,280
to do this it wasn't I didn't have any

1206
00:45:28,280 --> 00:45:30,190
sort contract there was no sort of

1207
00:45:30,190 --> 00:45:32,119
guarantees years offering he was just

1208
00:45:32,119 --> 00:45:33,950
one guys up committing code to github

1209
00:45:33,950 --> 00:45:37,520
and into into the registry so it's going

1210
00:45:37,520 --> 00:45:39,770
to come back to ultimately organizations

1211
00:45:39,770 --> 00:45:41,440
that using this code have to sort of be

1212
00:45:41,440 --> 00:45:45,440
a buyer buyer beware approach or suppose

1213
00:45:45,440 --> 00:45:49,190
a download everywhere approach wait wait

1214
00:45:49,190 --> 00:45:50,390
it's actually coming from where where's

1215
00:45:50,390 --> 00:45:53,630
it started I love that story because I

1216
00:45:53,630 --> 00:45:55,550
think like you just break it out there's

1217
00:45:55,550 --> 00:45:59,660
a lot of open source sauce into this

1218
00:45:59,660 --> 00:46:01,460
right this is kind of the stuff that

1219
00:46:01,460 --> 00:46:03,740
open source is built from the idea of

1220
00:46:03,740 --> 00:46:05,480
accepting contributions you know

1221
00:46:05,480 --> 00:46:07,609
mentoring other people to own your

1222
00:46:07,609 --> 00:46:09,290
project and you know help you contribute

1223
00:46:09,290 --> 00:46:11,210
so you know they are very empowered to

1224
00:46:11,210 --> 00:46:13,310
take some project and you know while you

1225
00:46:13,310 --> 00:46:14,869
are maybe continuing your journey with

1226
00:46:14,869 --> 00:46:18,650
something else and this story like sheds

1227
00:46:18,650 --> 00:46:20,839
a lot of light in to know how open

1228
00:46:20,839 --> 00:46:23,270
source is both amazing but also you know

1229
00:46:23,270 --> 00:46:26,210
has its kind of down fold with stuff

1230
00:46:26,210 --> 00:46:27,530
like you know social engineering in this

1231
00:46:27,530 --> 00:46:30,260
kind of way it's it's an interesting

1232
00:46:30,260 --> 00:46:32,990
story you know or problem space to

1233
00:46:32,990 --> 00:46:35,660
figure out as you know you there's no

1234
00:46:35,660 --> 00:46:37,220
like one person to blame

1235
00:46:37,220 --> 00:46:39,230
how this happened right there's multiple

1236
00:46:39,230 --> 00:46:41,750
ways both developers you know consuming

1237
00:46:41,750 --> 00:46:44,450
a library should they have had some kind

1238
00:46:44,450 --> 00:46:47,330
of pooling or some kind of policies to

1239
00:46:47,330 --> 00:46:49,580
vet their packages before they upgrade

1240
00:46:49,580 --> 00:46:51,980
before the install or whatever should

1241
00:46:51,980 --> 00:46:55,130
the registry have noted this kind of

1242
00:46:55,130 --> 00:46:57,530
ownership change and you know maybe had

1243
00:46:57,530 --> 00:46:59,930
alerted or you know had required someone

1244
00:46:59,930 --> 00:47:02,510
to to use like a assembler major change

1245
00:47:02,510 --> 00:47:05,150
just to reflect the fact that you know

1246
00:47:05,150 --> 00:47:07,670
something has changed there's a lot of

1247
00:47:07,670 --> 00:47:10,580
interesting talks around it I can share

1248
00:47:10,580 --> 00:47:13,880
from the node foundation side is there's

1249
00:47:13,880 --> 00:47:15,800
actually a funny story around it there's

1250
00:47:15,800 --> 00:47:17,690
been a so the net foundation is built

1251
00:47:17,690 --> 00:47:19,400
around different working room features

1252
00:47:19,400 --> 00:47:21,619
like a top level technical steering

1253
00:47:21,619 --> 00:47:24,650
committee community committee different

1254
00:47:24,650 --> 00:47:27,470
working groups all togethers and one of

1255
00:47:27,470 --> 00:47:29,240
the things is there's a working group

1256
00:47:29,240 --> 00:47:30,890
called package maintenance which has

1257
00:47:30,890 --> 00:47:32,599
existed for actually quite a while

1258
00:47:32,599 --> 00:47:34,970
before the event stream story and it was

1259
00:47:34,970 --> 00:47:37,220
really about about this how would how do

1260
00:47:37,220 --> 00:47:39,640
we make open-source

1261
00:47:39,640 --> 00:47:42,140
you know maintainable right successful

1262
00:47:42,140 --> 00:47:44,240
because you can't expect people to be

1263
00:47:44,240 --> 00:47:46,010
you know as they volunteer you know I

1264
00:47:46,010 --> 00:47:47,930
think the majority of open-source is you

1265
00:47:47,930 --> 00:47:50,270
know volunteer based and you can't

1266
00:47:50,270 --> 00:47:51,680
expect people to be committed to that

1267
00:47:51,680 --> 00:47:56,390
you know 24/7 etc so when they want to

1268
00:47:56,390 --> 00:47:59,240
move on you know with other projects how

1269
00:47:59,240 --> 00:48:01,940
do we make it sustainable so that the

1270
00:48:01,940 --> 00:48:04,160
project is kept alive a really good

1271
00:48:04,160 --> 00:48:06,619
example of that or you know at least a

1272
00:48:06,619 --> 00:48:09,349
very pure example of that is we had an

1273
00:48:09,349 --> 00:48:12,560
NPM also the story of left fad and you

1274
00:48:12,560 --> 00:48:16,369
know an maintainer that got you know I

1275
00:48:16,369 --> 00:48:20,359
would say it very easily upset with how

1276
00:48:20,359 --> 00:48:22,430
things were done and he just pulled a

1277
00:48:22,430 --> 00:48:25,400
lot of his code which actually broke so

1278
00:48:25,400 --> 00:48:27,680
many systems around the ecosystem

1279
00:48:27,680 --> 00:48:29,900
because everything was kind of not

1280
00:48:29,900 --> 00:48:31,580
everything but so many projects were

1281
00:48:31,580 --> 00:48:34,190
depended on it and so how do we make

1282
00:48:34,190 --> 00:48:35,480
that sustainable how do we make that

1283
00:48:35,480 --> 00:48:38,359
work how do we do that and the event

1284
00:48:38,359 --> 00:48:41,540
stream was a catalyst to bringing the

1285
00:48:41,540 --> 00:48:43,940
package maintenance working group back

1286
00:48:43,940 --> 00:48:47,450
to life and there's a lot of if you

1287
00:48:47,450 --> 00:48:48,950
would go if this is of interest anyone

1288
00:48:48,950 --> 00:48:51,020
who's listening there's a lot of really

1289
00:48:51,020 --> 00:48:51,380
good

1290
00:48:51,380 --> 00:48:54,170
yes and processes and policies that are

1291
00:48:54,170 --> 00:48:56,060
now being put into use for the node

1292
00:48:56,060 --> 00:48:58,310
foundation so at the very least we can

1293
00:48:58,310 --> 00:49:01,340
be you know very hopeful for things too

1294
00:49:01,340 --> 00:49:04,400
I know we've solved but better working

1295
00:49:04,400 --> 00:49:07,450
in the future I think it's worth the

1296
00:49:07,450 --> 00:49:09,620
reminding our listeners that open-source

1297
00:49:09,620 --> 00:49:11,900
maintainer czar only human you know I we

1298
00:49:11,900 --> 00:49:13,370
put up a lot of nice polish around our

1299
00:49:13,370 --> 00:49:15,140
projects but to the end of the day we're

1300
00:49:15,140 --> 00:49:17,900
only human and things like turnover and

1301
00:49:17,900 --> 00:49:19,520
burnout happened just as they would you

1302
00:49:19,520 --> 00:49:20,720
know inside employees in an organization

1303
00:49:20,720 --> 00:49:22,940
and so I think is you're a consuming

1304
00:49:22,940 --> 00:49:24,830
open source you have to keep continually

1305
00:49:24,830 --> 00:49:26,600
asking yourself can I contribute back

1306
00:49:26,600 --> 00:49:28,310
and maybe the answer is not right now

1307
00:49:28,310 --> 00:49:30,380
but then the next day might be yes I can

1308
00:49:30,380 --> 00:49:32,600
offer that community X I can offer them

1309
00:49:32,600 --> 00:49:35,150
why it's sort of that's that's what

1310
00:49:35,150 --> 00:49:38,780
makes this whole process work no very

1311
00:49:38,780 --> 00:49:42,500
much so I think that people see in

1312
00:49:42,500 --> 00:49:45,260
essence or scissors there it's free I

1313
00:49:45,260 --> 00:49:47,210
think is use it I think they're

1314
00:49:47,210 --> 00:49:48,710
necessary realized okay maybe there's no

1315
00:49:48,710 --> 00:49:51,260
monetary cost involved in that directly

1316
00:49:51,260 --> 00:49:54,040
that may there's a time investment or

1317
00:49:54,040 --> 00:49:56,360
maybe you want to be volunteering some

1318
00:49:56,360 --> 00:49:58,880
time back to actually give back to that

1319
00:49:58,880 --> 00:50:01,540
I think that if it's seen as a purely

1320
00:50:01,540 --> 00:50:04,070
take-take-take process where people just

1321
00:50:04,070 --> 00:50:07,370
use open source materials then you end

1322
00:50:07,370 --> 00:50:08,360
up in a situation where they suddenly

1323
00:50:08,360 --> 00:50:10,040
have some sort feel some sort of

1324
00:50:10,040 --> 00:50:11,420
entitlement say okay why isn't it's

1325
00:50:11,420 --> 00:50:12,920
working you need to go fix this now all

1326
00:50:12,920 --> 00:50:15,020
this is my hobby I do some on Sundays

1327
00:50:15,020 --> 00:50:19,550
when I've got my day off I mean except

1328
00:50:19,550 --> 00:50:21,500
I'm on the board of OS when we sort of

1329
00:50:21,500 --> 00:50:23,750
see similar issues now Hawass there's an

1330
00:50:23,750 --> 00:50:24,920
organization that's dedicated to

1331
00:50:24,920 --> 00:50:28,520
producing free application security

1332
00:50:28,520 --> 00:50:32,300
resources for for anyone to use and it's

1333
00:50:32,300 --> 00:50:34,390
been around for must become around for

1334
00:50:34,390 --> 00:50:37,640
17 18 years now something like that and

1335
00:50:37,640 --> 00:50:38,750
people just sort of assumed that it's

1336
00:50:38,750 --> 00:50:39,970
this big

1337
00:50:39,970 --> 00:50:42,200
maddening massive audience the best

1338
00:50:42,200 --> 00:50:45,350
example I seen of that was last laugh no

1339
00:50:45,350 --> 00:50:47,180
the year before 2017 when the latest

1340
00:50:47,180 --> 00:50:50,060
version of OS top 10 risks came out so

1341
00:50:50,060 --> 00:50:52,820
the 2017 version of the top 10 web

1342
00:50:52,820 --> 00:50:55,280
security risks came out and a lot of

1343
00:50:55,280 --> 00:50:56,480
people got very angry because they said

1344
00:50:56,480 --> 00:50:59,300
okay well this item on this new item on

1345
00:50:59,300 --> 00:51:01,370
list is just the the main take the

1346
00:51:01,370 --> 00:51:02,750
maintainer the project trying to sell

1347
00:51:02,750 --> 00:51:04,910
their product and there was a big big

1348
00:51:04,910 --> 00:51:08,150
Brown set and of the support leaders end

1349
00:51:08,150 --> 00:51:09,440
up standing down but one of the things I

1350
00:51:09,440 --> 00:51:11,390
said looked yeah this project this our

1351
00:51:11,390 --> 00:51:13,280
top ten project that's reference in

1352
00:51:13,280 --> 00:51:15,260
regulatory standards and all sorts of

1353
00:51:15,260 --> 00:51:16,370
things that's been around for so long

1354
00:51:16,370 --> 00:51:18,110
the worldly speaking is two guys

1355
00:51:18,110 --> 00:51:20,420
volunteering their time sitting down

1356
00:51:20,420 --> 00:51:22,040
gathering data together and coming up

1357
00:51:22,040 --> 00:51:23,360
with how they see it and just so happen

1358
00:51:23,360 --> 00:51:24,680
the two guys who are working on it both

1359
00:51:24,680 --> 00:51:26,420
worked at a company in a particular

1360
00:51:26,420 --> 00:51:28,730
space and therefore naturally their

1361
00:51:28,730 --> 00:51:30,860
point of view is shaped by where they

1362
00:51:30,860 --> 00:51:34,310
were working and you know the people saw

1363
00:51:34,310 --> 00:51:35,720
that OS top-10 as this massive

1364
00:51:35,720 --> 00:51:38,300
monolithic standard that had to have

1365
00:51:38,300 --> 00:51:40,160
complete integrity and be completely

1366
00:51:40,160 --> 00:51:41,990
pure of it only thing as two guys were

1367
00:51:41,990 --> 00:51:44,480
just giving their time to do it and then

1368
00:51:44,480 --> 00:51:47,240
afterwards they change they were the

1369
00:51:47,240 --> 00:51:48,830
maintainer zwerling and there were four

1370
00:51:48,830 --> 00:51:50,540
leaders and they made a very very open

1371
00:51:50,540 --> 00:51:52,460
process perfectly and github gathered

1372
00:51:52,460 --> 00:51:53,750
data from all sorts of sources and even

1373
00:51:53,750 --> 00:51:56,140
after they released their bought work

1374
00:51:56,140 --> 00:51:58,340
people still came back said okay why is

1375
00:51:58,340 --> 00:51:59,540
this like this why is it like that and

1376
00:51:59,540 --> 00:52:00,860
they just came back said look this is

1377
00:52:00,860 --> 00:52:02,810
been in github for six months be open

1378
00:52:02,810 --> 00:52:03,980
for common you could have open issues

1379
00:52:03,980 --> 00:52:05,210
people opened issues people open

1380
00:52:05,210 --> 00:52:06,350
comments there's no point coming right

1381
00:52:06,350 --> 00:52:07,460
now and saying well why is this like

1382
00:52:07,460 --> 00:52:08,630
this you could have said this two months

1383
00:52:08,630 --> 00:52:10,760
ago I did an issue and something might

1384
00:52:10,760 --> 00:52:13,370
have happened so it's very much about I

1385
00:52:13,370 --> 00:52:15,320
think maybe shifting your mindset here

1386
00:52:15,320 --> 00:52:16,940
saying okay we have all these open free

1387
00:52:16,940 --> 00:52:19,760
resources but there's a there's a

1388
00:52:19,760 --> 00:52:21,020
responsibility that comes with that of

1389
00:52:21,020 --> 00:52:26,120
giving back to that as well and staying

1390
00:52:26,120 --> 00:52:28,520
on this point as well I'd love to I'd

1391
00:52:28,520 --> 00:52:29,000
love to

1392
00:52:29,000 --> 00:52:30,350
we have about ten minutes left I would

1393
00:52:30,350 --> 00:52:33,430
love to finish with some some actionable

1394
00:52:33,430 --> 00:52:37,310
recommendations and suggestions for the

1395
00:52:37,310 --> 00:52:40,880
debate for developers and others to to

1396
00:52:40,880 --> 00:52:42,560
better take away and actually improve

1397
00:52:42,560 --> 00:52:44,660
their day to day that they'd say general

1398
00:52:44,660 --> 00:52:46,460
security practices now now Josh you

1399
00:52:46,460 --> 00:52:48,500
mentioned I was is you know a great

1400
00:52:48,500 --> 00:52:50,990
resource for education for developers in

1401
00:52:50,990 --> 00:52:53,720
general what what specifically you're

1402
00:52:53,720 --> 00:52:55,430
we've talked about the OWASP top 10

1403
00:52:55,430 --> 00:52:58,040
exactly the previous session which was

1404
00:52:58,040 --> 00:53:01,030
Jim Monaco which do many are very

1405
00:53:01,030 --> 00:53:03,410
actively with with a big knife and some

1406
00:53:03,410 --> 00:53:06,220
spray and if we have water session again

1407
00:53:06,220 --> 00:53:09,080
but Brian still shaking about that he

1408
00:53:09,080 --> 00:53:10,670
was still giving Brian some counseling

1409
00:53:10,670 --> 00:53:13,940
about that session but what the clad

1410
00:53:13,940 --> 00:53:16,070
things in what are the top things in in

1411
00:53:16,070 --> 00:53:16,600
you know

1412
00:53:16,600 --> 00:53:18,250
but you would recommend people people

1413
00:53:18,250 --> 00:53:21,040
you know read and also in general what

1414
00:53:21,040 --> 00:53:22,210
if you could give like a few piece of

1415
00:53:22,210 --> 00:53:23,800
advice to people to developers

1416
00:53:23,800 --> 00:53:27,070
what would you say they should do um

1417
00:53:27,070 --> 00:53:30,640
OS perspective like I said the top 10

1418
00:53:30,640 --> 00:53:32,500
risks I suppose the most the most

1419
00:53:32,500 --> 00:53:34,960
popular well-known project and that's

1420
00:53:34,960 --> 00:53:37,050
something that's been around for

1421
00:53:37,050 --> 00:53:39,520
probably almost as long as OS but being

1422
00:53:39,520 --> 00:53:41,800
around and the idea behind that Dogma is

1423
00:53:41,800 --> 00:53:43,120
to raise awareness it's about saying you

1424
00:53:43,120 --> 00:53:44,710
know here the top 10 things are gonna

1425
00:53:44,710 --> 00:53:47,140
give you a bad day we're not necessarily

1426
00:53:47,140 --> 00:53:48,730
meanest olia developers were just a

1427
00:53:48,730 --> 00:53:50,380
meanness is general awareness at all

1428
00:53:50,380 --> 00:53:51,970
levels in disease or seen as more

1429
00:53:51,970 --> 00:53:56,140
management level doctrine and then the

1430
00:53:56,140 --> 00:53:57,550
the document that Jim was talking about

1431
00:53:57,550 --> 00:53:59,230
last week was the top 10 for active

1432
00:53:59,230 --> 00:54:00,850
controls which is sort of response to

1433
00:54:00,850 --> 00:54:02,470
the OS top 10 in some ways it's saying

1434
00:54:02,470 --> 00:54:05,260
look there's a top-10 risk see the

1435
00:54:05,260 --> 00:54:06,220
things that are going to ruin your day

1436
00:54:06,220 --> 00:54:09,040
but let's think about how we empower

1437
00:54:09,040 --> 00:54:10,600
developers slightly more and give them a

1438
00:54:10,600 --> 00:54:12,010
slightly more positive way of thinking

1439
00:54:12,010 --> 00:54:13,450
about - not saying it is the bad things

1440
00:54:13,450 --> 00:54:14,530
are gonna happen they're gonna say okay

1441
00:54:14,530 --> 00:54:15,400
these are the good things you should be

1442
00:54:15,400 --> 00:54:17,440
doing so the product of controls is sort

1443
00:54:17,440 --> 00:54:19,330
of a nice starting point of 10 areas

1444
00:54:19,330 --> 00:54:21,190
that developers might well be thinking

1445
00:54:21,190 --> 00:54:24,250
about from a security perspective and

1446
00:54:24,250 --> 00:54:25,870
then if we sort of get more in depth

1447
00:54:25,870 --> 00:54:27,370
than that there's the application

1448
00:54:27,370 --> 00:54:29,620
security verification standard which is

1449
00:54:29,620 --> 00:54:32,020
another document that is very very

1450
00:54:32,020 --> 00:54:33,520
detailed and sort of goes into self

1451
00:54:33,520 --> 00:54:36,370
line-by-line controls that developers

1452
00:54:36,370 --> 00:54:37,690
should be thinking about when building

1453
00:54:37,690 --> 00:54:39,760
into their applications we recently

1454
00:54:39,760 --> 00:54:41,710
recently released version 4 of the

1455
00:54:41,710 --> 00:54:45,640
document ASVs I was involved in that as

1456
00:54:45,640 --> 00:54:49,450
well the other thing that OS does is it

1457
00:54:49,450 --> 00:54:52,930
has the actual product products you can

1458
00:54:52,930 --> 00:54:54,070
play with has various fun of all

1459
00:54:54,070 --> 00:54:57,640
applications so I think Leon mentioned

1460
00:54:57,640 --> 00:54:59,910
earlier note goat if I'm not mistaken

1461
00:54:59,910 --> 00:55:02,920
which is a application written nodejs

1462
00:55:02,920 --> 00:55:05,250
with a lot of known vulnerabilities

1463
00:55:05,250 --> 00:55:07,450
another one which is also written in

1464
00:55:07,450 --> 00:55:09,310
node.js by for instance but it's very

1465
00:55:09,310 --> 00:55:12,490
very very advanced is the OS juice shop

1466
00:55:12,490 --> 00:55:17,080
which is a very realistic it's of

1467
00:55:17,080 --> 00:55:18,520
e-commerce start application where you

1468
00:55:18,520 --> 00:55:20,530
can buy juice but it's also got a very

1469
00:55:20,530 --> 00:55:21,970
large number of different

1470
00:55:21,970 --> 00:55:23,800
vulnerabilities so that's something that

1471
00:55:23,800 --> 00:55:25,420
anyone can download set up in da

1472
00:55:25,420 --> 00:55:27,310
container set up in Heroku or something

1473
00:55:27,310 --> 00:55:29,740
like that and start I find

1474
00:55:29,740 --> 00:55:30,460
vulnerabilities

1475
00:55:30,460 --> 00:55:32,020
practice their skills in thereit's and

1476
00:55:32,020 --> 00:55:33,369
they might xs/s they can start trying to

1477
00:55:33,369 --> 00:55:36,700
exploit XSS and this in this application

1478
00:55:36,700 --> 00:55:40,329
or for other different other different

1479
00:55:40,329 --> 00:55:41,829
vulnerabilities in their vote about so

1480
00:55:41,829 --> 00:55:43,569
you know there are lots of different

1481
00:55:43,569 --> 00:55:47,260
resources that OS boffer generally

1482
00:55:47,260 --> 00:55:50,920
they'll also be local chapters all

1483
00:55:50,920 --> 00:55:52,210
around the world we've got one here in

1484
00:55:52,210 --> 00:55:54,760
Israel I know in the UK there are lots

1485
00:55:54,760 --> 00:55:56,619
of different cities have London Bristol

1486
00:55:56,619 --> 00:56:00,400
Cambridge Newcastle all sorts of

1487
00:56:00,400 --> 00:56:04,380
different around the country that meets

1488
00:56:04,380 --> 00:56:07,750
at least once every three months I think

1489
00:56:07,750 --> 00:56:09,099
and not have speakers talking about

1490
00:56:09,099 --> 00:56:10,630
different topics around the security

1491
00:56:10,630 --> 00:56:12,339
application and Security's there's also

1492
00:56:12,339 --> 00:56:15,280
you know Rica places to meet other

1493
00:56:15,280 --> 00:56:16,960
people who have an interest in security

1494
00:56:16,960 --> 00:56:18,490
than necessarily working security

1495
00:56:18,490 --> 00:56:21,220
now overall OS tends to aim more at the

1496
00:56:21,220 --> 00:56:23,170
developers it's not designed to be a

1497
00:56:23,170 --> 00:56:25,089
hardcore security let's go and break in

1498
00:56:25,089 --> 00:56:26,829
hack stuff it's more of okay how can we

1499
00:56:26,829 --> 00:56:29,140
fix this yes certainly if we look at the

1500
00:56:29,140 --> 00:56:31,359
OS conferences for example there the

1501
00:56:31,359 --> 00:56:32,950
lineup for OS conferences a very much

1502
00:56:32,950 --> 00:56:34,540
developer focused very much okay here's

1503
00:56:34,540 --> 00:56:36,040
how we fix this particular problem

1504
00:56:36,040 --> 00:56:38,559
here's an idea of how you can go back to

1505
00:56:38,559 --> 00:56:40,690
organisations and do this let's say see

1506
00:56:40,690 --> 00:56:43,809
the sort of here's how we broke this

1507
00:56:43,809 --> 00:56:46,000
thing completely away here's how we took

1508
00:56:46,000 --> 00:56:47,950
this webcam and shredded it yeah it's

1509
00:56:47,950 --> 00:56:50,079
very much ok here's how we try and solve

1510
00:56:50,079 --> 00:56:53,200
this problem and the global conferences

1511
00:56:53,200 --> 00:56:55,059
as well have training courses attached

1512
00:56:55,059 --> 00:56:56,410
to them so we've got the global

1513
00:56:56,410 --> 00:56:58,690
conference car in tel-aviv like I said

1514
00:56:58,690 --> 00:56:59,410
at the end of May

1515
00:56:59,410 --> 00:57:01,510
and that's three days of training most

1516
00:57:01,510 --> 00:57:03,430
of which are aimed at developers or

1517
00:57:03,430 --> 00:57:08,170
people working in R&D teams and after

1518
00:57:08,170 --> 00:57:09,309
that the two days of the conference

1519
00:57:09,309 --> 00:57:13,510
itself you know that training very much

1520
00:57:13,510 --> 00:57:14,859
designed to cover all sorts different

1521
00:57:14,859 --> 00:57:16,750
topics as training for developers who

1522
00:57:16,750 --> 00:57:19,020
may be new to security training for

1523
00:57:19,020 --> 00:57:20,680
security professionals gonna get a

1524
00:57:20,680 --> 00:57:21,730
little bit more experience than one of

1525
00:57:21,730 --> 00:57:25,680
the more advanced web hacking techniques

1526
00:57:25,680 --> 00:57:28,030
there's a training course about dev set

1527
00:57:28,030 --> 00:57:29,470
cops have them integrates

1528
00:57:29,470 --> 00:57:31,750
security tools into the continuous

1529
00:57:31,750 --> 00:57:34,680
integration communes delivery pipeline

1530
00:57:34,680 --> 00:57:36,760
of course about containers you know

1531
00:57:36,760 --> 00:57:39,040
sorts different topics that focused

1532
00:57:39,040 --> 00:57:41,109
around application security and product

1533
00:57:41,109 --> 00:57:43,660
security and the training courses do do

1534
00:57:43,660 --> 00:57:43,990
cost

1535
00:57:43,990 --> 00:57:45,550
because we've got trainers flying over

1536
00:57:45,550 --> 00:57:48,460
to give their time to that but you know

1537
00:57:48,460 --> 00:57:49,810
really the global conferences and the

1538
00:57:49,810 --> 00:57:51,430
training training courses hatch to

1539
00:57:51,430 --> 00:57:53,170
really only things that with our stood

1540
00:57:53,170 --> 00:57:54,820
directly cost money you can be a member

1541
00:57:54,820 --> 00:57:57,030
and it costs not very much about a year

1542
00:57:57,030 --> 00:57:58,960
there's really the whole wealth of

1543
00:57:58,960 --> 00:58:00,310
different information there so I'd say

1544
00:58:00,310 --> 00:58:02,080
you have to vote the people interested

1545
00:58:02,080 --> 00:58:03,730
in game getting more involved without

1546
00:58:03,730 --> 00:58:05,110
try and find out about your local

1547
00:58:05,110 --> 00:58:06,520
chapter try and find out who's involved

1548
00:58:06,520 --> 00:58:09,340
locally and get new people and a

1549
00:58:09,340 --> 00:58:10,360
different point in the right direction

1550
00:58:10,360 --> 00:58:15,010
or age around the education of

1551
00:58:15,010 --> 00:58:17,560
developers there's key fever and

1552
00:58:17,560 --> 00:58:20,020
anything you know yeah I would say from

1553
00:58:20,020 --> 00:58:21,910
the Container Security site I would be

1554
00:58:21,910 --> 00:58:24,160
remiss not to mention that we have a

1555
00:58:24,160 --> 00:58:25,690
series called exploring container

1556
00:58:25,690 --> 00:58:28,270
security on the GCP blog and it's not

1557
00:58:28,270 --> 00:58:30,670
just google kubernetes engine specific

1558
00:58:30,670 --> 00:58:32,350
it's you know broader about the the

1559
00:58:32,350 --> 00:58:35,050
space and I think if people just have

1560
00:58:35,050 --> 00:58:36,550
the mindset if I'm gonna make an effort

1561
00:58:36,550 --> 00:58:38,230
to kind of be this informed consumer

1562
00:58:38,230 --> 00:58:40,060
that we were talking about with making

1563
00:58:40,060 --> 00:58:41,350
sure I'm receiving information about

1564
00:58:41,350 --> 00:58:44,560
patches with regards to containers you

1565
00:58:44,560 --> 00:58:45,940
know reading up on what's gonna work for

1566
00:58:45,940 --> 00:58:47,680
my organization what's gonna work for

1567
00:58:47,680 --> 00:58:49,420
our context sure I think if you just

1568
00:58:49,420 --> 00:58:53,080
start with the mindset of string

1569
00:58:53,080 --> 00:58:54,369
containers may not necessarily be the

1570
00:58:54,369 --> 00:58:55,930
most secure option for me you're in a

1571
00:58:55,930 --> 00:58:57,580
good spot if you're at least considering

1572
00:58:57,580 --> 00:59:00,609
that beyond that you know a lot of the

1573
00:59:00,609 --> 00:59:02,170
container security work revolves around

1574
00:59:02,170 --> 00:59:04,240
either OCI or the kubernetes communities

1575
00:59:04,240 --> 00:59:05,890
there's lots of other orchestration

1576
00:59:05,890 --> 00:59:07,869
tools but kubernetes kind of is the I

1577
00:59:07,869 --> 00:59:10,420
say it's the whirlwind of the hub you

1578
00:59:10,420 --> 00:59:11,560
know so if you start hanging out around

1579
00:59:11,560 --> 00:59:13,270
the kubernetes security channels and

1580
00:59:13,270 --> 00:59:14,350
community you'll start getting some

1581
00:59:14,350 --> 00:59:16,990
answers there you know in general for

1582
00:59:16,990 --> 00:59:18,400
both open-source maintainer is looking

1583
00:59:18,400 --> 00:59:20,109
for more security expertise as well as

1584
00:59:20,109 --> 00:59:22,270
consumers the communities are friendly

1585
00:59:22,270 --> 00:59:23,710
and where people particularly in

1586
00:59:23,710 --> 00:59:25,240
security really wanna help and share

1587
00:59:25,240 --> 00:59:27,010
information so if you just reach out on

1588
00:59:27,010 --> 00:59:29,080
you know IRC or slack or wherever the

1589
00:59:29,080 --> 00:59:30,730
community hangs out and just ask I want

1590
00:59:30,730 --> 00:59:34,930
help that's you will find an answer okay

1591
00:59:34,930 --> 00:59:37,930
thank you and under on why don't you

1592
00:59:37,930 --> 00:59:39,070
wait you finished just awfully wrong

1593
00:59:39,070 --> 00:59:42,040
with didn't ye recently wrote docker

1594
00:59:42,040 --> 00:59:44,770
chichi write up some security tips in

1595
00:59:44,770 --> 00:59:46,770
there

1596
00:59:46,770 --> 00:59:50,980
or at least what's coming from say yes

1597
00:59:50,980 --> 00:59:54,010
so we so I wrote a couple of those

1598
00:59:54,010 --> 00:59:55,540
tickets one of them is that docker

1599
00:59:55,540 --> 00:59:57,340
images security with the help of

1600
00:59:57,340 --> 01:00:00,240
over a week of running from saluto and

1601
01:00:00,240 --> 01:00:04,600
also an NPM security best practices as

1602
01:00:04,600 --> 01:00:07,060
well with with one picado his

1603
01:00:07,060 --> 01:00:10,300
decrementing / - EO and both of them are

1604
01:00:10,300 --> 01:00:11,680
really around you know you're using

1605
01:00:11,680 --> 01:00:13,000
these tools you're using you know

1606
01:00:13,000 --> 01:00:14,800
building better images you're using and

1607
01:00:14,800 --> 01:00:15,400
gambelli

1608
01:00:15,400 --> 01:00:17,740
but there are some really good security

1609
01:00:17,740 --> 01:00:20,620
practices that you should follow so so

1610
01:00:20,620 --> 01:00:22,060
you know just look up for those will

1611
01:00:22,060 --> 01:00:23,380
probably mention them later in the

1612
01:00:23,380 --> 01:00:24,850
channel just to give you some some

1613
01:00:24,850 --> 01:00:28,000
resources and I also wanted to give I

1614
01:00:28,000 --> 01:00:30,460
think Josh and and did a great job at

1615
01:00:30,460 --> 01:00:32,980
giving several perspectives of how to

1616
01:00:32,980 --> 01:00:35,470
kind of get started with security I want

1617
01:00:35,470 --> 01:00:36,880
to give that developer a side of it

1618
01:00:36,880 --> 01:00:40,150
which is I would say what worked for me

1619
01:00:40,150 --> 01:00:42,580
at least as a team lead for previous

1620
01:00:42,580 --> 01:00:44,740
companies I've worked at is if you have

1621
01:00:44,740 --> 01:00:46,600
if you can have one of the team members

1622
01:00:46,600 --> 01:00:48,790
out of the hole you know R&D developers

1623
01:00:48,790 --> 01:00:51,790
teams assuming that you know a large

1624
01:00:51,790 --> 01:00:55,750
enough world to work on having you know

1625
01:00:55,750 --> 01:00:57,700
empowering one of them a place to be a

1626
01:00:57,700 --> 01:00:59,590
security champion to be someone who

1627
01:00:59,590 --> 01:01:01,600
would advocate for security there's

1628
01:01:01,600 --> 01:01:03,670
