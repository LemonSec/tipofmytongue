00:04:04,470 --> 00:04:06,000
need to do the transformation will

101
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:08,310
explains about what is our background to

102
00:04:08,310 --> 00:04:10,019
do the transformation and the reason

103
00:04:10,019 --> 00:04:14,239
behind it and the second is about all

104
00:04:14,239 --> 00:04:16,709
transformation roadmap will explain

105
00:04:16,709 --> 00:04:18,510
about how we are doing the

106
00:04:18,510 --> 00:04:21,269
transformation and also the Deaf Cyclops

107
00:04:21,269 --> 00:04:24,750
implementation this is the key point

108
00:04:24,750 --> 00:04:27,620
will explain about how we implement

109
00:04:27,620 --> 00:04:30,180
DevOps values in an hour

110
00:04:30,180 --> 00:04:33,479
default and Ardex a cops adoption so

111
00:04:33,479 --> 00:04:35,820
also what is the challenges when we

112
00:04:35,820 --> 00:04:39,479
started so we'll tell you about our

113
00:04:39,479 --> 00:04:42,270
challenges as long as we are trying to

114
00:04:42,270 --> 00:04:44,880
transform and what a benefit of Dipset

115
00:04:44,880 --> 00:04:51,690
cops for facing these challenges okay so

116
00:04:51,690 --> 00:04:54,300
before I start so I wanna explains about

117
00:04:54,300 --> 00:04:56,310
what is the digital transformation so

118
00:04:56,310 --> 00:04:59,550
every industry here it's also talks

119
00:04:59,550 --> 00:05:01,590
about the digital transformation

120
00:05:01,590 --> 00:05:04,020
so it's Levitical transformation it's an

121
00:05:04,020 --> 00:05:06,060
integration of the digital technology

122
00:05:06,060 --> 00:05:09,710
into all areas of business so

123
00:05:09,710 --> 00:05:11,759
fundamentally is changing how you

124
00:05:11,759 --> 00:05:13,830
operate and deliver value to their

125
00:05:13,830 --> 00:05:17,550
customers not only that it's also change

126
00:05:17,550 --> 00:05:20,130
your culture that requires the

127
00:05:20,130 --> 00:05:21,930
organization to continually challenge

128
00:05:21,930 --> 00:05:24,479
the status core experience experiment

129
00:05:24,479 --> 00:05:28,020
and get comfortable with the failure so

130
00:05:28,020 --> 00:05:30,840
this is the meaning of the digital

131
00:05:30,840 --> 00:05:36,449
transformation that I know so and then

132
00:05:36,449 --> 00:05:38,880
what is the transformation roadmap so

133
00:05:38,880 --> 00:05:41,970
before we start the transformation so we

134
00:05:41,970 --> 00:05:47,099
are good to do the going to do create a

135
00:05:47,099 --> 00:05:50,639
roadmap for for at least for three years

136
00:05:50,639 --> 00:05:54,330
so we divide it into three aspects of

137
00:05:54,330 --> 00:05:57,180
people process and technology this our

138
00:05:57,180 --> 00:06:01,500
Trias plan a roadmap for to do the

139
00:06:01,500 --> 00:06:07,500
transformation so first we have we need

140
00:06:07,500 --> 00:06:11,370
to infuse a gel devops culture mindset

141
00:06:11,370 --> 00:06:13,849
in the business and IT leadership and

142
00:06:13,849 --> 00:06:17,610
six strong buy-in and sponsorship to

143
00:06:17,610 --> 00:06:21,659
change especially in indonesia the

144
00:06:21,659 --> 00:06:28,849
management level is a very very has big

145
00:06:28,849 --> 00:06:32,940
influence to the employee to through

146
00:06:32,940 --> 00:06:35,639
through some job or to do some tests so

147
00:06:35,639 --> 00:06:37,830
that's why we need to seek strong buy-in

148
00:06:37,830 --> 00:06:41,060
from them first so we need to see

149
00:06:41,060 --> 00:06:46,160
the heavier of our organization and also

150
00:06:46,160 --> 00:06:49,600
the second so we need to adopt the right

151
00:06:49,600 --> 00:06:52,040
organizational structure to quickly

152
00:06:52,040 --> 00:06:55,700
incubate the a gel skillset and also

153
00:06:55,700 --> 00:06:59,630
start piloting the agile project so we

154
00:06:59,630 --> 00:07:02,300
need to understand doing such a big

155
00:07:02,300 --> 00:07:04,550
transformation for the big company is

156
00:07:04,550 --> 00:07:08,750
not easy so we separate the IT legacy we

157
00:07:08,750 --> 00:07:11,240
create a new organization structure to

158
00:07:11,240 --> 00:07:14,300
incubate a job missing and we want to

159
00:07:14,300 --> 00:07:16,610
see the positive progress and show to

160
00:07:16,610 --> 00:07:19,910
the IT legacy our improvement and maybe

161
00:07:19,910 --> 00:07:23,030
the real interest rate join with us so

162
00:07:23,030 --> 00:07:26,480
this is one part of the strategy so

163
00:07:26,480 --> 00:07:29,120
first we need to stick the strong buy-in

164
00:07:29,120 --> 00:07:30,980
from the management level and in the

165
00:07:30,980 --> 00:07:32,890
second we need to adopt the right

166
00:07:32,890 --> 00:07:36,470
organizational structure so quickly

167
00:07:36,470 --> 00:07:39,620
incubate the a gel skill and then the

168
00:07:39,620 --> 00:07:42,110
third is we need to start the wining

169
00:07:42,110 --> 00:07:44,060
policy and procedure for agile

170
00:07:44,060 --> 00:07:46,670
methodology and also there folks because

171
00:07:46,670 --> 00:07:49,220
we are in the banking industry and a

172
00:07:49,220 --> 00:07:51,770
highly regulated industry so we need to

173
00:07:51,770 --> 00:07:53,870
divine the policy and procedures for

174
00:07:53,870 --> 00:07:57,830
supporting our new way and the last one

175
00:07:57,830 --> 00:08:01,010
we start built the stack of architecture

176
00:08:01,010 --> 00:08:04,490
and automate everything so we start from

177
00:08:04,490 --> 00:08:08,180
the management and also we built the the

178
00:08:08,180 --> 00:08:13,070
environment first before we have we do

179
00:08:13,070 --> 00:08:15,440
it to do the deficit hawks architecture

180
00:08:15,440 --> 00:08:19,240
and we do the alternate for everything

181
00:08:19,240 --> 00:08:22,670
so Italy transformation is a journey so

182
00:08:22,670 --> 00:08:25,100
we keep trying to do our best to keep

183
00:08:25,100 --> 00:08:27,230
trying from finishing our top-level

184
00:08:27,230 --> 00:08:31,640
management by how we start small it's

185
00:08:31,640 --> 00:08:35,960
like practicing the culture first or we

186
00:08:35,960 --> 00:08:39,590
need to when I proposed the deficit of

187
00:08:39,590 --> 00:08:42,679
architecture so my boss was responses

188
00:08:42,679 --> 00:08:44,630
like this please

189
00:08:44,630 --> 00:08:46,700
Nadira don't boil the ocean and I keep

190
00:08:46,700 --> 00:08:49,730
presently containing them not only about

191
00:08:49,730 --> 00:08:51,290
the automation but also the

192
00:08:51,290 --> 00:08:54,530
collaboration so I talked to the

193
00:08:54,530 --> 00:08:58,100
so when we start the day of Cyclops

194
00:08:58,100 --> 00:09:01,130
initiative is not about we do some

195
00:09:01,130 --> 00:09:04,040
automation we also start with the

196
00:09:04,040 --> 00:09:07,310
collaboration theme and all so step by

197
00:09:07,310 --> 00:09:09,230
step must surely know they accept it

198
00:09:09,230 --> 00:09:10,700
with one step and we continue the

199
00:09:10,700 --> 00:09:16,790
processes okay so and then the desktops

200
00:09:16,790 --> 00:09:19,580
implementation is it the part or the

201
00:09:19,580 --> 00:09:24,520
main part of this so we see this

202
00:09:24,520 --> 00:09:27,470
actually DevOps will complement the

203
00:09:27,470 --> 00:09:29,420
agile method ready to break the silos

204
00:09:29,420 --> 00:09:32,120
and achieve better IP alignment

205
00:09:32,120 --> 00:09:34,790
increase delivery certainty and the

206
00:09:34,790 --> 00:09:37,880
speed to the market and also if you put

207
00:09:37,880 --> 00:09:40,160
the security on it so we can deliver

208
00:09:40,160 --> 00:09:43,760
more security application so actually

209
00:09:43,760 --> 00:09:48,670
this is like when you see there is four

210
00:09:48,670 --> 00:09:53,500
four people here when you do some

211
00:09:53,500 --> 00:09:56,180
actually when you want to create some

212
00:09:56,180 --> 00:09:57,890
business or you want to create some

213
00:09:57,890 --> 00:10:01,640
product so we have a customer so we also

214
00:10:01,640 --> 00:10:04,940
have a development here and also we have

215
00:10:04,940 --> 00:10:08,240
IP operation and also IT security so

216
00:10:08,240 --> 00:10:12,589
before they have in every role they have

217
00:10:12,589 --> 00:10:13,990
some walls

218
00:10:13,990 --> 00:10:18,430
actually this so in customer they always

219
00:10:18,430 --> 00:10:22,940
wanting some flexibility so what they do

220
00:10:22,940 --> 00:10:26,150
is they created the flexibility and they

221
00:10:26,150 --> 00:10:29,300
want to improve time to market actually

222
00:10:29,300 --> 00:10:32,210
and also how about the development team

223
00:10:32,210 --> 00:10:34,880
the development team is only one thing

224
00:10:34,880 --> 00:10:38,240
some change so he create effective

225
00:10:38,240 --> 00:10:41,600
change and apt and modify feature so

226
00:10:41,600 --> 00:10:45,860
this is what they do if you see the

227
00:10:45,860 --> 00:10:48,950
agile development so they combining

228
00:10:48,950 --> 00:10:52,880
customer and development they break down

229
00:10:52,880 --> 00:10:57,080
the wall this wall is break down and

230
00:10:57,080 --> 00:10:59,450
also what their achieve their early chip

231
00:10:59,450 --> 00:11:02,750
is the point one and point two so they

232
00:11:02,750 --> 00:11:04,790
have a better business IP alignment

233
00:11:04,790 --> 00:11:07,040
between customer and development and

234
00:11:07,040 --> 00:11:08,270
also they can in

235
00:11:08,270 --> 00:11:10,880
every certainty because there is no

236
00:11:10,880 --> 00:11:13,370
barriers and between customer and

237
00:11:13,370 --> 00:11:15,980
development sir

238
00:11:15,980 --> 00:11:20,060
and then the devops era is coming so the

239
00:11:20,060 --> 00:11:23,060
IPO operation is become of them so what

240
00:11:23,060 --> 00:11:26,930
yes the main idea operation is all

241
00:11:26,930 --> 00:11:30,110
always one is there one thing stability

242
00:11:30,110 --> 00:11:34,700
of the environment and what they were

243
00:11:34,700 --> 00:11:37,700
they do is they create the stability and

244
00:11:37,700 --> 00:11:40,160
also enhance services

245
00:11:40,160 --> 00:11:42,980
so this IT operation so the dear folks

246
00:11:42,980 --> 00:11:46,640
will give some benefit is it's it's

247
00:11:46,640 --> 00:11:49,520
called faster speed to the market so we

248
00:11:49,520 --> 00:11:55,160
can achieve like three this if you doing

249
00:11:55,160 --> 00:11:57,709
the DevOps and also how about the IT

250
00:11:57,709 --> 00:12:01,580
security is there always left behind so

251
00:12:01,580 --> 00:12:03,950
the security is always in the right so

252
00:12:03,950 --> 00:12:07,250
when your product is already done and in

253
00:12:07,250 --> 00:12:10,640
the security guys just in from it's a

254
00:12:10,640 --> 00:12:14,630
very late so they become a blocker so

255
00:12:14,630 --> 00:12:18,350
now we want to break wall this wall by

256
00:12:18,350 --> 00:12:21,079
doing their seconds so we want to

257
00:12:21,079 --> 00:12:24,680
deliver more secure application so what

258
00:12:24,680 --> 00:12:29,660
is the main objective of the IT security

259
00:12:29,660 --> 00:12:32,870
so they only want to create a security

260
00:12:32,870 --> 00:12:34,820
and also they I want to enhance the

261
00:12:34,820 --> 00:12:38,120
security services and if you do the

262
00:12:38,120 --> 00:12:41,060
Deaf's I hope so you the IPS crater will

263
00:12:41,060 --> 00:12:44,329
do the security as approach on the

264
00:12:44,329 --> 00:12:47,959
development pipeline so if you will see

265
00:12:47,959 --> 00:12:52,040
this just you can see like this is a

266
00:12:52,040 --> 00:12:55,370
paste of SDLC safe your development

267
00:12:55,370 --> 00:12:58,930
lifecycle so we started from code built

268
00:12:58,930 --> 00:13:02,089
integrate test the fire release and

269
00:13:02,089 --> 00:13:07,070
upgrade so what if the we do it's an eye

270
00:13:07,070 --> 00:13:10,160
gel development so we can do in this

271
00:13:10,160 --> 00:13:13,550
build pace and also we reduce the CI

272
00:13:13,550 --> 00:13:16,400
panting in distance occasion so we do in

273
00:13:16,400 --> 00:13:20,510
until the test space and hope if you see

274
00:13:20,510 --> 00:13:22,420
the CI CD

275
00:13:22,420 --> 00:13:25,060
so you can see like a continuous

276
00:13:25,060 --> 00:13:27,130
delivery and under continuous deployment

277
00:13:27,130 --> 00:13:29,710
if you do the continuous delivery as a

278
00:13:29,710 --> 00:13:31,900
business decision is to go alive

279
00:13:31,900 --> 00:13:35,200
so in our purpose organization we do

280
00:13:35,200 --> 00:13:38,770
their business decision to go life so we

281
00:13:38,770 --> 00:13:42,700
do their continuous delivery so how

282
00:13:42,700 --> 00:13:45,040
about the continuous the deployment so

283
00:13:45,040 --> 00:13:47,560
you do until the release so when you

284
00:13:47,560 --> 00:13:50,290
pull support see the cut will be go to

285
00:13:50,290 --> 00:13:53,200
the production in a one-click so if you

286
00:13:53,200 --> 00:13:55,750
do the DevOps or Jessica so you do it

287
00:13:55,750 --> 00:14:00,610
until the operate okay so when we want

288
00:14:00,610 --> 00:14:03,820
to do some implementation in the death

289
00:14:03,820 --> 00:14:13,780
Cyclops Italy so we need to understand

290
00:14:13,780 --> 00:14:17,010
so we want to do the desert ops

291
00:14:17,010 --> 00:14:19,120
implementation is not about the

292
00:14:19,120 --> 00:14:24,220
automation so we need to have five this

293
00:14:24,220 --> 00:14:29,260
element first is the culture so the

294
00:14:29,260 --> 00:14:31,990
culture change is a never easy but

295
00:14:31,990 --> 00:14:34,540
without the culture change all practice

296
00:14:34,540 --> 00:14:37,240
are failed so this is a very mandatory

297
00:14:37,240 --> 00:14:38,920
because the culture is like and

298
00:14:38,920 --> 00:14:41,770
everything so the second thing that

299
00:14:41,770 --> 00:14:44,880
usually the easy ways is the automation

300
00:14:44,880 --> 00:14:48,010
the automation alone is it cannot give

301
00:14:48,010 --> 00:14:50,080
you the DevOps our deficit cops but

302
00:14:50,080 --> 00:14:52,930
cannot success with torrid and avoid

303
00:14:52,930 --> 00:14:55,990
tools that enforce it so the automation

304
00:14:55,990 --> 00:15:01,390
is also important so you need to do the

305
00:15:01,390 --> 00:15:04,090
culture chains and also to do the

306
00:15:04,090 --> 00:15:06,610
automation if you see there are my

307
00:15:06,610 --> 00:15:10,300
previous slides about the roadmap so the

308
00:15:10,300 --> 00:15:14,470
first thing is I we do is we want to

309
00:15:14,470 --> 00:15:18,100
create some chains and SiC Buy in from

310
00:15:18,100 --> 00:15:21,250
the management first so we do it not

311
00:15:21,250 --> 00:15:23,860
from the automation we start it from

312
00:15:23,860 --> 00:15:29,380
their culture chains so the third is the

313
00:15:29,380 --> 00:15:34,660
lien lien is a such a process so if you

314
00:15:34,660 --> 00:15:35,860
do the DevOps

315
00:15:35,860 --> 00:15:39,070
the cops so you need to have lean

316
00:15:39,070 --> 00:15:41,890
process is not like a complicated

317
00:15:41,890 --> 00:15:44,740
process so you need to create more fail

318
00:15:44,740 --> 00:15:48,100
used in every process that you deliver

319
00:15:48,100 --> 00:15:51,820
to the customer actually you need to see

320
00:15:51,820 --> 00:15:55,360
with the fewer resource and less waste

321
00:15:55,360 --> 00:16:01,090
so how you can do the maximal maximal

322
00:16:01,090 --> 00:16:04,480
things for the processes and then the

323
00:16:04,480 --> 00:16:07,720
fourth thing is a measure so everything

324
00:16:07,720 --> 00:16:11,020
you do you need you you need to measure

325
00:16:11,020 --> 00:16:14,140
it if you can't measure it so you can

326
00:16:14,140 --> 00:16:18,190
improve it the last thing is a sharing

327
00:16:18,190 --> 00:16:21,880
the sharing is like you need to build

328
00:16:21,880 --> 00:16:24,970
some the collaboration tools between

329
00:16:24,970 --> 00:16:29,530
there between the people on the same

330
00:16:29,530 --> 00:16:34,080
it's a bit pinned app developer business

331
00:16:34,080 --> 00:16:36,970
operation and also security so you need

332
00:16:36,970 --> 00:16:42,640
to build some desperate to see how about

333
00:16:42,640 --> 00:16:46,300
the collaboration between them so if you

334
00:16:46,300 --> 00:16:50,590
see the images here you see the culture

335
00:16:50,590 --> 00:16:54,040
is the lightener chakra if you focus

336
00:16:54,040 --> 00:16:57,100
only the process it is only a small fist

337
00:16:57,100 --> 00:17:00,760
and if you only focus on architecture so

338
00:17:00,760 --> 00:17:03,010
architecture is will be bite by the

339
00:17:03,010 --> 00:17:07,780
structure and there and the culture will

340
00:17:07,780 --> 00:17:10,540
by the net everything here so we need to

341
00:17:10,540 --> 00:17:14,079
focusing on the culture first and we

342
00:17:14,079 --> 00:17:17,170
know change change people change the

343
00:17:17,170 --> 00:17:21,220
culture is the not an easy way but you

344
00:17:21,220 --> 00:17:25,530
need to see this real this we will cover

345
00:17:25,530 --> 00:17:29,350
all of this a one by one so how we do

346
00:17:29,350 --> 00:17:33,640
the implementation around effects are

347
00:17:33,640 --> 00:17:36,940
different - the cops but about the

348
00:17:36,940 --> 00:17:41,460
failures so

349
00:17:45,890 --> 00:17:49,860
okay so allegations culture is one of

350
00:17:49,860 --> 00:17:53,010
stronger predictors for both IT

351
00:17:53,010 --> 00:17:56,900
performance and overall performance of

352
00:17:56,900 --> 00:18:00,090
organization so we need to do the

353
00:18:00,090 --> 00:18:04,020
sipping thoughts and behavior culture of

354
00:18:04,020 --> 00:18:06,270
staff failure and also the culture of

355
00:18:06,270 --> 00:18:08,970
the continuous improvement so this is

356
00:18:08,970 --> 00:18:12,360
the very important thing to build the

357
00:18:12,360 --> 00:18:15,120
culture of the staff failure so many

358
00:18:15,120 --> 00:18:19,020
organization here example in Indonesia

359
00:18:19,020 --> 00:18:22,470
is a lie can deepen hierarchy so

360
00:18:22,470 --> 00:18:26,429
everyone is like say yes to his boss oh

361
00:18:26,429 --> 00:18:33,240
man so we are struggling to build this

362
00:18:33,240 --> 00:18:37,799
kind of culture but we started so we

363
00:18:37,799 --> 00:18:43,380
need to move from this into this so if

364
00:18:43,380 --> 00:18:47,100
you currently is an IT focus it's only

365
00:18:47,100 --> 00:18:49,679
inside out so you need to think about

366
00:18:49,679 --> 00:18:53,720
the customer focus so from outside and

367
00:18:53,720 --> 00:18:57,539
so when you suddenly is working in silos

368
00:18:57,539 --> 00:18:59,840
so you need to think about that

369
00:18:59,840 --> 00:19:03,480
cross-functional team and and if you

370
00:19:03,480 --> 00:19:06,000
find the organization still do the

371
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:08,340
command and control so you need to

372
00:19:08,340 --> 00:19:10,520
change the self organize and

373
00:19:10,520 --> 00:19:14,789
collaboration and also if you only focus

374
00:19:14,789 --> 00:19:18,330
on the task oriented so now you need to

375
00:19:18,330 --> 00:19:21,570
become outcome oriented and also if you

376
00:19:21,570 --> 00:19:26,640
have half a bleb culture so don't blame

377
00:19:26,640 --> 00:19:28,530
it to people so you should take

378
00:19:28,530 --> 00:19:31,860
responsibility for every toss and every

379
00:19:31,860 --> 00:19:35,280
responsibility that give it to you so

380
00:19:35,280 --> 00:19:38,159
from being reactive to proactive and

381
00:19:38,159 --> 00:19:40,740
also if you are a system currently so

382
00:19:40,740 --> 00:19:44,070
you need to be flexible so you also need

383
00:19:44,070 --> 00:19:49,919
to gain the high trust actually I know

384
00:19:49,919 --> 00:19:53,309
this is not easy to change this kind of

385
00:19:53,309 --> 00:19:57,830
stuff but we need to chain

386
00:20:09,550 --> 00:20:14,990
okay so the second is how do we do how

387
00:20:14,990 --> 00:20:18,950
we do there to do the culture change

388
00:20:18,950 --> 00:20:22,520
first we change the organizational

389
00:20:22,520 --> 00:20:25,960
structure so this is the currently

390
00:20:25,960 --> 00:20:28,310
organization structure from the

391
00:20:28,310 --> 00:20:31,220
structure so we need to move to matrix

392
00:20:31,220 --> 00:20:34,970
structure why we need to do the matrix

393
00:20:34,970 --> 00:20:38,870
structure so everyone it's like it's a

394
00:20:38,870 --> 00:20:42,130
one circle is to do it like you have

395
00:20:42,130 --> 00:20:45,950
some ball inside and you do some

396
00:20:45,950 --> 00:20:50,240
collaboration for each so we also divide

397
00:20:50,240 --> 00:20:53,660
it by stream and product and also we

398
00:20:53,660 --> 00:20:56,840
provide an organic dot we also have a

399
00:20:56,840 --> 00:20:59,960
third team if you need to you are you X

400
00:20:59,960 --> 00:21:02,900
so you need an enterprise as a vector if

401
00:21:02,900 --> 00:21:05,360
you need the DevOps engineer and also

402
00:21:05,360 --> 00:21:08,480
the other SME so you can share this team

403
00:21:08,480 --> 00:21:12,020
but we also have a dedicated team so

404
00:21:12,020 --> 00:21:15,830
this is the one way so we do the culture

405
00:21:15,830 --> 00:21:18,440
change my change the organizational

406
00:21:18,440 --> 00:21:21,020
structure from the structural into the

407
00:21:21,020 --> 00:21:24,430
matrix structure

408
00:21:24,430 --> 00:21:29,320
so the the failure number two is an

409
00:21:29,320 --> 00:21:35,050
automation so forth to do the automation

410
00:21:35,050 --> 00:21:36,910
is it the easy way to do the automation

411
00:21:36,910 --> 00:21:40,300
actually so we need to adopt taking the

412
00:21:40,300 --> 00:21:42,970
automation so we avoid tools that

413
00:21:42,970 --> 00:21:50,650
enforces silos so we need to see all the

414
00:21:50,650 --> 00:21:54,790
tools that we have currently so we need

415
00:21:54,790 --> 00:21:58,570
to also to examine that the tools is not

416
00:21:58,570 --> 00:22:01,990
bringing the silos to the team so we

417
00:22:01,990 --> 00:22:04,060
need to like if you use some

418
00:22:04,060 --> 00:22:07,450
collaboration tools so like everyone and

419
00:22:07,450 --> 00:22:10,810
if you developer if your operation and

420
00:22:10,810 --> 00:22:14,500
also if you are security and also if you

421
00:22:14,500 --> 00:22:17,260
are business so you can have so one

422
00:22:17,260 --> 00:22:18,070
dashboard

423
00:22:18,070 --> 00:22:21,960
another one tools that you can share it

424
00:22:21,960 --> 00:22:24,850
so what we do forward to do the

425
00:22:24,850 --> 00:22:29,140
automation first we do the architect we

426
00:22:29,140 --> 00:22:31,420
do the architect before the automating

427
00:22:31,420 --> 00:22:35,590
and also we assess all the existing

428
00:22:35,590 --> 00:22:39,130
tools and automation capabilities we

429
00:22:39,130 --> 00:22:41,980
because we need to we need to know all

430
00:22:41,980 --> 00:22:45,580
that we have before we buy the new one

431
00:22:45,580 --> 00:22:49,900
this is important and also we and the

432
00:22:49,900 --> 00:22:53,560
third we need to identify critical gaps

433
00:22:53,560 --> 00:22:56,620
from our existing tools and our district

434
00:22:56,620 --> 00:23:03,610
ops architecture for so what we need to

435
00:23:03,610 --> 00:23:08,980
do is we we need to seek vendor for PLC

436
00:23:08,980 --> 00:23:11,530
and also we do the ultimate it's only

437
00:23:11,530 --> 00:23:14,430
for the high value and reflective break

438
00:23:14,430 --> 00:23:17,860
we also need to optimize workflow but

439
00:23:17,860 --> 00:23:23,050
the bottleneck so you see the highlight

440
00:23:23,050 --> 00:23:26,070
in the red tights

441
00:23:26,070 --> 00:23:31,720
you say it's like you have never under

442
00:23:31,720 --> 00:23:34,780
estimate the effort and cost building to

443
00:23:34,780 --> 00:23:37,960
change from the open source application

444
00:23:37,960 --> 00:23:39,940
because the open source is not

445
00:23:39,940 --> 00:23:43,749
necessarily free and you need to modify

446
00:23:43,749 --> 00:23:48,970
the source fit to your needs actually so

447
00:23:48,970 --> 00:23:51,279
when you do their automation this is

448
00:23:51,279 --> 00:23:54,129
some tips and this is what we do it's a

449
00:23:54,129 --> 00:23:56,619
like sixth step so we need to architect

450
00:23:56,619 --> 00:23:58,749
and we need to assess we identify the

451
00:23:58,749 --> 00:24:01,480
critical gap so we seek the funder for

452
00:24:01,480 --> 00:24:04,600
the point PLC we do the automates only

453
00:24:04,600 --> 00:24:07,090
for the - you and the repetitive work

454
00:24:07,090 --> 00:24:09,009
and also we optimize the workflow

455
00:24:09,009 --> 00:24:14,139
bottleneck so this is a guidance so when

456
00:24:14,139 --> 00:24:17,860
we want to choose the the DevOps tools

457
00:24:17,860 --> 00:24:28,210
or Delta table stones actually okay so

458
00:24:28,210 --> 00:24:30,999
you can see that I copied it from the

459
00:24:30,999 --> 00:24:35,200
sabia lab so you can see it is you can

460
00:24:35,200 --> 00:24:36,940
find the light source control management

461
00:24:36,940 --> 00:24:39,659
so you can find it at the base

462
00:24:39,659 --> 00:24:42,340
automation and now continuous

463
00:24:42,340 --> 00:24:44,559
integration in the blue one so you can

464
00:24:44,559 --> 00:24:48,179
use the gentian you can you see like

465
00:24:48,179 --> 00:24:54,730
Travis CI and see our CI every ass and

466
00:24:54,730 --> 00:24:55,509
at all

467
00:24:55,509 --> 00:24:58,990
so you can do some deployment tools so

468
00:24:58,990 --> 00:25:03,669
you can yeah you can see it on hit so

469
00:25:03,669 --> 00:25:11,259
this is the so you really see this so

470
00:25:11,259 --> 00:25:13,210
this is our map of the sector of

471
00:25:13,210 --> 00:25:15,700
Architecture from the process till the

472
00:25:15,700 --> 00:25:20,139
tools that we use actually for each pace

473
00:25:20,139 --> 00:25:23,139
so we already mapping tools that we use

474
00:25:23,139 --> 00:25:25,960
currently so we can start it from the

475
00:25:25,960 --> 00:25:30,999
plan from the plan pace so the objective

476
00:25:30,999 --> 00:25:33,009
is to make a backlog grooming

477
00:25:33,009 --> 00:25:36,249
so we divine user story Burdine chart

478
00:25:36,249 --> 00:25:38,830
and also security requirement tools that

479
00:25:38,830 --> 00:25:43,330
we use in JIRA and I RM of 10 and also

480
00:25:43,330 --> 00:25:47,230
for develop pace and then the objective

481
00:25:47,230 --> 00:25:49,720
is to develop application and also

482
00:25:49,720 --> 00:25:51,760
surface using a fish

483
00:25:51,760 --> 00:25:54,640
control traceability and continuous

484
00:25:54,640 --> 00:25:59,170
integration so for the developed pace so

485
00:25:59,170 --> 00:26:02,770
we used an eclipse visual studio and web

486
00:26:02,770 --> 00:26:06,490
method inside in the build so the

487
00:26:06,490 --> 00:26:09,370
objective is we manage and track all the

488
00:26:09,370 --> 00:26:11,680
document and then changes to the

489
00:26:11,680 --> 00:26:13,990
application and configuration management

490
00:26:13,990 --> 00:26:17,920
so the toast that we used is we use this

491
00:26:17,920 --> 00:26:25,750
G solid qsca a bit bucket and Jenkins

492
00:26:25,750 --> 00:26:28,630
actually in a test pace so we do this

493
00:26:28,630 --> 00:26:32,520
some ultimate taste strip and swish

494
00:26:32,520 --> 00:26:36,460
pushing including integration so user

495
00:26:36,460 --> 00:26:39,490
acceptance and secreted test on it so

496
00:26:39,490 --> 00:26:42,550
the tools that we use is solar tube see

497
00:26:42,550 --> 00:26:47,950
a selenium an HP fortify so in the

498
00:26:47,950 --> 00:26:51,340
deploy phase the objective or deploy

499
00:26:51,340 --> 00:26:54,280
apps and provision environment using the

500
00:26:54,280 --> 00:26:56,010
automation and standardized

501
00:26:56,010 --> 00:27:00,700
configuration we use the Red Hat open

502
00:27:00,700 --> 00:27:04,630
zip and usually and for the operate so

503
00:27:04,630 --> 00:27:06,790
the opportunity faceoff for measure

504
00:27:06,790 --> 00:27:08,950
performance of environment and

505
00:27:08,950 --> 00:27:11,830
application we use an app demo namely

506
00:27:11,830 --> 00:27:17,610
mix and also spawn so this is a

507
00:27:17,610 --> 00:27:20,110
structure from the process tell the

508
00:27:20,110 --> 00:27:21,460
toaster yes

509
00:27:21,460 --> 00:27:25,000
sorry buildings like this there it is

510
00:27:25,000 --> 00:27:30,390
one of the acetate ER for the processes

511
00:27:30,390 --> 00:27:33,700
so we do it some code development in a

512
00:27:33,700 --> 00:27:36,370
controlled environment and utilization

513
00:27:36,370 --> 00:27:38,200
of the fashions

514
00:27:38,200 --> 00:27:42,340
control system both for code and test so

515
00:27:42,340 --> 00:27:45,570
we do it this and we're building out the

516
00:27:45,570 --> 00:27:49,960
50s and a very wide build success and

517
00:27:49,960 --> 00:27:55,450
also we continuous deployment to be a

518
00:27:55,450 --> 00:27:58,840
dedicated target a test system so this

519
00:27:58,840 --> 00:28:01,770
one and also for the notification

520
00:28:01,770 --> 00:28:05,470
reporting of build and test results

521
00:28:05,470 --> 00:28:08,799
the person so integrated with the

522
00:28:08,799 --> 00:28:17,280
Application Lifecycle Management okay so

523
00:28:17,280 --> 00:28:20,620
so this is from the lean process we're

524
00:28:20,620 --> 00:28:23,440
going to realize we already talked about

525
00:28:23,440 --> 00:28:26,020
the culture change and also for the

526
00:28:26,020 --> 00:28:28,570
automation the next is we talked about

527
00:28:28,570 --> 00:28:35,500
the lean so often they're the adoption

528
00:28:35,500 --> 00:28:37,750
of the desert office goes hand in hand

529
00:28:37,750 --> 00:28:40,390
with the application of land lean

530
00:28:40,390 --> 00:28:44,080
practices limb practices are focused on

531
00:28:44,080 --> 00:28:46,450
the value creation for the end customer

532
00:28:46,450 --> 00:28:50,440
with the minimal waste and process so

533
00:28:50,440 --> 00:28:53,740
what we do is a simple so we need to

534
00:28:53,740 --> 00:28:56,049
simple statement or identify the ways if

535
00:28:56,049 --> 00:28:58,510
you are not adding the failure then you

536
00:28:58,510 --> 00:29:01,840
add in their face so how we eliminate

537
00:29:01,840 --> 00:29:05,440
the waste and so how do we eliminate the

538
00:29:05,440 --> 00:29:08,289
waste so what we do is we start

539
00:29:08,289 --> 00:29:12,309
finishing and stop starting or limit the

540
00:29:12,309 --> 00:29:16,120
working progress so if you guys using

541
00:29:16,120 --> 00:29:18,940
the Kanban so you can familiar with this

542
00:29:18,940 --> 00:29:20,940
kind of work

543
00:29:20,940 --> 00:29:23,860
so working forget this amount of your

544
00:29:23,860 --> 00:29:26,350
work so you have started but it's not

545
00:29:26,350 --> 00:29:30,130
yet complete so on the factory floor the

546
00:29:30,130 --> 00:29:33,460
IP is the hub assembly item that are

547
00:29:33,460 --> 00:29:35,799
lying about the waiting to be completed

548
00:29:35,799 --> 00:29:39,309
any many thing we ap is the way to

549
00:29:39,309 --> 00:29:42,789
increase throughput in your software so

550
00:29:42,789 --> 00:29:45,789
start working on the multiple tasks at

551
00:29:45,789 --> 00:29:49,000
the same time people think that they are

552
00:29:49,000 --> 00:29:52,299
multi testing but in the reality they

553
00:29:52,299 --> 00:29:54,789
are context switching so it's switch

554
00:29:54,789 --> 00:29:59,799
takes time to ramp up to take longer to

555
00:29:59,799 --> 00:30:04,630
complete so the second thing is you

556
00:30:04,630 --> 00:30:05,170
should

557
00:30:05,170 --> 00:30:08,329
[Music]

558
00:30:12,879 --> 00:30:17,809
and also you need to avoid the hands of

559
00:30:17,809 --> 00:30:20,419
fire the next thing is you need to do

560
00:30:20,419 --> 00:30:22,820
the look reduced infant Sisseton see

561
00:30:22,820 --> 00:30:24,729
actually this is a light and in Japanese

562
00:30:24,729 --> 00:30:27,739
alien process this is muda muda dan

563
00:30:27,739 --> 00:30:31,249
Murray and worried so Mora is reduced in

564
00:30:31,249 --> 00:30:34,580
consistency if you should make

565
00:30:34,580 --> 00:30:39,019
everything as simple as possible so but

566
00:30:39,019 --> 00:30:40,309
not simpler

567
00:30:40,309 --> 00:30:43,340
so wherever possible in our production

568
00:30:43,340 --> 00:30:46,129
process so we should be stripping for

569
00:30:46,129 --> 00:30:49,369
the simplicity we must avoid the

570
00:30:49,369 --> 00:30:53,029
complexity for example if we built a

571
00:30:53,029 --> 00:30:55,179
complex system then the cause of

572
00:30:55,179 --> 00:30:58,009
implication for us and an ultra steamer

573
00:30:58,009 --> 00:30:58,929
is huge

574
00:30:58,929 --> 00:31:03,399
due to the multitude of the problems and

575
00:31:03,399 --> 00:31:09,649
in the second four we want to build so

576
00:31:09,649 --> 00:31:13,580
we want to build some lean process we

577
00:31:13,580 --> 00:31:18,679
need to do Marie but is over burden it's

578
00:31:18,679 --> 00:31:22,210
and that activity were processed before

579
00:31:22,210 --> 00:31:29,059
machines are so you need to remove the

580
00:31:29,059 --> 00:31:32,359
bottleneck so if you guys have read the

581
00:31:32,359 --> 00:31:37,279
punic spread jerk therefore smooth the

582
00:31:37,279 --> 00:31:39,799
DevOps novel so then you will know all

583
00:31:39,799 --> 00:31:44,450
about the character bren-bren is a rock

584
00:31:44,450 --> 00:31:47,720
star of an engineer however as a result

585
00:31:47,720 --> 00:31:50,799
of his rock star status

586
00:31:50,799 --> 00:31:54,499
he is essential for every project and is

587
00:31:54,499 --> 00:31:57,769
the battery overcommitted so brand is a

588
00:31:57,769 --> 00:32:01,429
human bottleneck is a kind of human

589
00:32:01,429 --> 00:32:03,649
bottleneck the hero of the novel

590
00:32:03,649 --> 00:32:06,799
accelerate works and removes weights by

591
00:32:06,799 --> 00:32:09,619
finding ways to protect brand from the

592
00:32:09,619 --> 00:32:12,729
interruption and way to devote work

593
00:32:12,729 --> 00:32:16,249
allowing brain effort to be focused

594
00:32:16,249 --> 00:32:19,549
elsewhere so many of organization half a

595
00:32:19,549 --> 00:32:22,779
brand type character so they are someone

596
00:32:22,779 --> 00:32:24,620
without whom

597
00:32:24,620 --> 00:32:29,960
works would stop these people are almost

598
00:32:29,960 --> 00:32:33,650
emitted and fast burn out they are or so

599
00:32:33,650 --> 00:32:36,890
or very committed they feel that to

600
00:32:36,890 --> 00:32:38,990
visit to document their process or

601
00:32:38,990 --> 00:32:42,530
methodology leading a solution where

602
00:32:42,530 --> 00:32:45,620
they are a single point of failure so

603
00:32:45,620 --> 00:32:48,320
Italy how many things have good two

604
00:32:48,320 --> 00:32:51,590
percent for the product down easier so

605
00:32:51,590 --> 00:32:54,650
becoming Lin is one happen overnight it

606
00:32:54,650 --> 00:32:58,550
will involve some introspection into who

607
00:32:58,550 --> 00:33:02,450
we are and how we operate we can take

608
00:33:02,450 --> 00:33:05,660
inspiration from the life in Amazon but

609
00:33:05,660 --> 00:33:08,480
we should also be taught me them that we

610
00:33:08,480 --> 00:33:10,730
have completely different culture than

611
00:33:10,730 --> 00:33:15,740
Amazon so you can can just copy it so

612
00:33:15,740 --> 00:33:20,050
you need to learn your organization

613
00:33:27,040 --> 00:33:32,200
and this is how we do some Lin

614
00:33:32,200 --> 00:33:36,140
so if you think our limb is we need to

615
00:33:36,140 --> 00:33:43,370
to spit IP so we we use the traditional

616
00:33:43,370 --> 00:33:47,240
way and also the agile way for the

617
00:33:47,240 --> 00:33:50,929
traditional way one if already know

618
00:33:50,929 --> 00:33:54,860
about the requirements is fits and they

619
00:33:54,860 --> 00:33:57,890
have a clear expectation they also only

620
00:33:57,890 --> 00:34:01,220
have a minimum rate of change so the

621
00:34:01,220 --> 00:34:03,140
application is a focus on the

622
00:34:03,140 --> 00:34:04,640
application that required a high

623
00:34:04,640 --> 00:34:08,480
stability so you can use this term and

624
00:34:08,480 --> 00:34:11,149
also if you don't have no chance while

625
00:34:11,149 --> 00:34:14,359
development so you can go through use

626
00:34:14,359 --> 00:34:18,739
this process and how about if the

627
00:34:18,739 --> 00:34:22,159
characteristic of your product is

628
00:34:22,159 --> 00:34:24,020
evolving the requirements and also

629
00:34:24,020 --> 00:34:27,379
incremental definitely and also the

630
00:34:27,379 --> 00:34:29,780
frequent chains and also you had you

631
00:34:29,780 --> 00:34:32,060
need to faster time to the market you

632
00:34:32,060 --> 00:34:34,969
also need to customer oriented products

633
00:34:34,969 --> 00:34:37,599
and get a little different feedback and

634
00:34:37,599 --> 00:34:40,489
also need to accommodate change during

635
00:34:40,489 --> 00:34:42,260
development so you can go with that

636
00:34:42,260 --> 00:34:45,109
angel so depend on the product that you

637
00:34:45,109 --> 00:34:50,719
want to to build actually so this is the

638
00:34:50,719 --> 00:34:54,760
process that we use to to do for

639
00:34:54,760 --> 00:34:58,700
doing our limb process so we have some

640
00:34:58,700 --> 00:35:03,470
of the rules here so you can see here

641
00:35:03,470 --> 00:35:05,920
you we have a subject matter expert

642
00:35:05,920 --> 00:35:09,710
subject matter effort or one of the

643
00:35:09,710 --> 00:35:13,130
expert is an IT security so security

644
00:35:13,130 --> 00:35:16,430
here has an onion so this is our agile

645
00:35:16,430 --> 00:35:19,280
approaches so we start the process is

646
00:35:19,280 --> 00:35:21,680
from strawberry workshops is like

647
00:35:21,680 --> 00:35:26,690
everyone's come sit in a one table so we

648
00:35:26,690 --> 00:35:31,070
also do some spring training system to

649
00:35:31,070 --> 00:35:34,000
do some right of product development

650
00:35:34,000 --> 00:35:37,880
initiative we do some like daily standup

651
00:35:37,880 --> 00:35:41,150
and also we do like spring execution for

652
00:35:41,150 --> 00:35:44,900
every two weeks and we do some spin

653
00:35:44,900 --> 00:35:45,940
review we

654
00:35:45,940 --> 00:35:50,650
some spring tour before is everything is

655
00:35:50,650 --> 00:35:54,869
a one to go slaps if we can do you can

656
00:35:54,869 --> 00:35:59,160
go to the RCB is a release change board

657
00:35:59,160 --> 00:36:03,700
so just for the methylation of profile

658
00:36:03,700 --> 00:36:07,030
so why we still in it an RC B so we

659
00:36:07,030 --> 00:36:09,339
because we are in the banking industry

660
00:36:09,339 --> 00:36:14,559
so we need to do this actually so this

661
00:36:14,559 --> 00:36:17,589
is some of the scription so for your

662
00:36:17,589 --> 00:36:22,480
lean agile so you can do license travel

663
00:36:22,480 --> 00:36:24,700
workshops at the description is so

664
00:36:24,700 --> 00:36:27,130
what's wrong doing here so how many

665
00:36:27,130 --> 00:36:29,740
duration that you think you should and

666
00:36:29,740 --> 00:36:33,099
who is involved on it so we have an

667
00:36:33,099 --> 00:36:37,359
essay here so you see everyone is in IT

668
00:36:37,359 --> 00:36:39,910
security and I to say architecture and

669
00:36:39,910 --> 00:36:43,089
also in an IT and fascicles so you call

670
00:36:43,089 --> 00:36:46,750
it an SME here so they will involve in

671
00:36:46,750 --> 00:36:49,119
it this carefully workshop and also in

672
00:36:49,119 --> 00:36:53,020
the retrospective they will get attached

673
00:36:53,020 --> 00:36:57,130
and also in the sprint review ok this is

674
00:36:57,130 --> 00:37:01,210
the folder lean and how about how about

675
00:37:01,210 --> 00:37:07,779
in the security term so security within

676
00:37:07,779 --> 00:37:10,390
the software lifecycle in how to secure

677
00:37:10,390 --> 00:37:14,619
a stage in the software lifecycle a tree

678
00:37:14,619 --> 00:37:17,410
DevOps for security we call it the death

679
00:37:17,410 --> 00:37:22,930
record the idea is a tool built on the

680
00:37:22,930 --> 00:37:26,579
mindset that everyone is responsible for

681
00:37:26,579 --> 00:37:29,500
security with the call of the semi

682
00:37:29,500 --> 00:37:32,020
distributing security nutrition expert

683
00:37:32,020 --> 00:37:34,930
and skill to those who hold the highest

684
00:37:34,930 --> 00:37:37,809
level of contacts without sacrificing

685
00:37:37,809 --> 00:37:42,190
the staff be required so we put also the

686
00:37:42,190 --> 00:37:44,380
security within the software lifecycle

687
00:37:44,380 --> 00:37:48,880
in the plant base we embed the security

688
00:37:48,880 --> 00:37:54,130
requirement here and also in development

689
00:37:54,130 --> 00:37:57,609
pace which we should do this sort code

690
00:37:57,609 --> 00:37:59,119
review and

691
00:37:59,119 --> 00:38:01,369
starting at a store we do some free air

692
00:38:01,369 --> 00:38:03,740
for their ability assessment when

693
00:38:03,740 --> 00:38:07,430
discussing testing and also we do some

694
00:38:07,430 --> 00:38:09,920
security hardening and also pitch

695
00:38:09,920 --> 00:38:12,049
management so the security awareness

696
00:38:12,049 --> 00:38:15,710
reduced in the whole process from the

697
00:38:15,710 --> 00:38:18,680
plant to the operate and also the

698
00:38:18,680 --> 00:38:21,650
security guys as an SME is also standby

699
00:38:21,650 --> 00:38:25,039
from the beginning until their that the

700
00:38:25,039 --> 00:38:27,890
product is released when you do the

701
00:38:27,890 --> 00:38:30,650
deploy so you should put in some

702
00:38:30,650 --> 00:38:32,480
security hardening on it then you would

703
00:38:32,480 --> 00:38:35,480
do the pitch management also you put the

704
00:38:35,480 --> 00:38:39,349
90 fighters here in the open it so you

705
00:38:39,349 --> 00:38:44,650
put in an CM even monitoring on it

706
00:38:44,650 --> 00:38:48,109
it's elite this is like your whistle we

707
00:38:48,109 --> 00:38:50,509
already discussed about the culture yeah

708
00:38:50,509 --> 00:38:53,720
it's just about the automation and also

709
00:38:53,720 --> 00:38:57,470
the Lin process it's like the next is

710
00:38:57,470 --> 00:39:02,749
the measurement so the exams the exams

711
00:39:02,749 --> 00:39:05,509
of the measure in their hopes or dips

712
00:39:05,509 --> 00:39:08,059
AQAP's is an Emily capture and review

713
00:39:08,059 --> 00:39:10,670
your metrics and measurement and then

714
00:39:10,670 --> 00:39:16,759
tactics Chen so we used like this

715
00:39:16,759 --> 00:39:19,549
measure methods is like by logging and

716
00:39:19,549 --> 00:39:22,430
monitoring strategy so this is our

717
00:39:22,430 --> 00:39:25,039
number of the disparate liabilities and

718
00:39:25,039 --> 00:39:27,769
KPI key performance indicator they can

719
00:39:27,769 --> 00:39:29,559
be captured

720
00:39:29,559 --> 00:39:32,900
first is the we do it's like min time to

721
00:39:32,900 --> 00:39:36,799
recover or mean time to restore so how

722
00:39:36,799 --> 00:39:38,930
much the chains failure rate so

723
00:39:38,930 --> 00:39:41,539
percentage of the fail to the successful

724
00:39:41,539 --> 00:39:44,599
deployment and also how about the time

725
00:39:44,599 --> 00:39:51,630
in cycle in cement

726
00:39:51,630 --> 00:39:56,010
and also for the sharing so the sharing

727
00:39:56,010 --> 00:39:59,490
we built some one of there is the

728
00:39:59,490 --> 00:40:01,620
community of practices to provide

729
00:40:01,620 --> 00:40:04,200
setting fail used in desktops or

730
00:40:04,200 --> 00:40:07,200
depakote so we have we built like

731
00:40:07,200 --> 00:40:11,460
internal community one of it is an info

732
00:40:11,460 --> 00:40:13,850
information security company is it to

733
00:40:13,850 --> 00:40:17,670
share about the awareness security and

734
00:40:17,670 --> 00:40:20,940
also we develop a gel devops community

735
00:40:20,940 --> 00:40:24,210
so what is the benefit to the members so

736
00:40:24,210 --> 00:40:27,300
we can build my professional network to

737
00:40:27,300 --> 00:40:29,850
the stimler interest and also the

738
00:40:29,850 --> 00:40:32,250
members can access to the expertise to

739
00:40:32,250 --> 00:40:34,650
seek help with their work to a challenge

740
00:40:34,650 --> 00:40:37,560
and also nurture personal development

741
00:40:37,560 --> 00:40:39,860
and professional in the device and how

742
00:40:39,860 --> 00:40:43,470
to achieve meaningful work so for the

743
00:40:43,470 --> 00:40:45,740
organization the benefit of this

744
00:40:45,740 --> 00:40:48,300
community of practices is a foster

745
00:40:48,300 --> 00:40:51,180
probability building and also enabling

746
00:40:51,180 --> 00:40:53,820
knowledge sharing retention and reuse

747
00:40:53,820 --> 00:40:57,990
and support energy across the units and

748
00:40:57,990 --> 00:41:02,280
retention of the talents what we do is

749
00:41:02,280 --> 00:41:08,340
we have like we put all the material as

750
00:41:08,340 --> 00:41:11,610
a theory in a shared web base in the I

751
00:41:11,610 --> 00:41:14,790
shed and electronic knowledge management

752
00:41:14,790 --> 00:41:18,470
system on it

753
00:41:24,250 --> 00:41:27,740
okay so how about the challenges so this

754
00:41:27,740 --> 00:41:31,190
is the challenges for our organization

755
00:41:31,190 --> 00:41:34,010
but this my last addenda about the

756
00:41:34,010 --> 00:41:37,670
challenge why while adopting the DevOps

757
00:41:37,670 --> 00:41:39,410
in our organization and what the

758
00:41:39,410 --> 00:41:41,540
benefits of default is a depth of hopes

759
00:41:41,540 --> 00:41:44,990
in our original definition the first

760
00:41:44,990 --> 00:41:48,680
challenge is the ripples connect between

761
00:41:48,680 --> 00:41:51,140
delivery and application support and

762
00:41:51,140 --> 00:41:53,690
what the DevOps our deficit hopes

763
00:41:53,690 --> 00:41:59,150
benefit is like to do some collaboration

764
00:41:59,150 --> 00:42:01,190
between the delivery and application

765
00:42:01,190 --> 00:42:05,450
support the next challenge is currently

766
00:42:05,450 --> 00:42:06,950
will work in silo

767
00:42:06,950 --> 00:42:11,030
so by implement the DevOps or Delta cops

768
00:42:11,030 --> 00:42:14,330
so we can like drive integration and

769
00:42:14,330 --> 00:42:16,550
repeatability and reliability through

770
00:42:16,550 --> 00:42:25,370
the automation and also the third is we

771
00:42:25,370 --> 00:42:28,610
found hand over it's a very slow and

772
00:42:28,610 --> 00:42:31,850
also completely meeting time to the

773
00:42:31,850 --> 00:42:34,330
market

774
00:42:35,990 --> 00:42:39,089
and what the DevOps and left the cops

775
00:42:39,089 --> 00:42:41,700
benefit so we can do some continuous

776
00:42:41,700 --> 00:42:44,520
evaluation of practices and close by

777
00:42:44,520 --> 00:42:48,990
doing this other's challenges is a big

778
00:42:48,990 --> 00:42:51,119
choice we are the banking and in the

779
00:42:51,119 --> 00:42:54,480
highly regulated industry so the other

780
00:42:54,480 --> 00:42:56,790
challenge is the resistant to change

781
00:42:56,790 --> 00:42:59,250
from the internal and also the

782
00:42:59,250 --> 00:43:03,390
regulatory aspect it's a from internal

783
00:43:03,390 --> 00:43:06,780
audit risk management compliance and

784
00:43:06,780 --> 00:43:10,109
also from regulatory so this to

785
00:43:10,109 --> 00:43:13,200
challenge we still try our best result

786
00:43:13,200 --> 00:43:15,680
is with the regulatory we try to make

787
00:43:15,680 --> 00:43:19,980
such a good lesson submit them so Italy

788
00:43:19,980 --> 00:43:25,440
this how we do some implementation do

789
00:43:25,440 --> 00:43:30,000
The Drifter cops in our banking industry

790
00:43:30,000 --> 00:43:35,069
the cases in the banking industry so we

791
00:43:35,069 --> 00:43:37,770
need to focus not only with the

792
00:43:37,770 --> 00:43:40,980
automation some people think so but when

793
00:43:40,980 --> 00:43:42,869
you do the deficit cops are you

794
00:43:42,869 --> 00:43:45,780
you only focusing on the automation but

795
00:43:45,780 --> 00:43:48,630
that is not true so you need to focus on

796
00:43:48,630 --> 00:43:51,059
the five things so you need to focus on

797
00:43:51,059 --> 00:43:53,940
culture your organization culture and

798
00:43:53,940 --> 00:43:57,750
you do the automation to help them and

799
00:43:57,750 --> 00:44:00,990
also you need to live your processes and

800
00:44:00,990 --> 00:44:03,510
also you need to be sure and also you

801
00:44:03,510 --> 00:44:05,880
need to share you have some

802
00:44:05,880 --> 00:44:10,640
collaboration tools it is Italy this is

803
00:44:10,640 --> 00:44:14,760
the end of my presentation so I really

804
00:44:14,760 --> 00:44:18,480
give back to you thank you thank you so

805
00:44:18,480 --> 00:44:22,470
much so I'm gonna prolong you more on

806
00:44:22,470 --> 00:44:24,390
this session since I know it's like

807
00:44:24,390 --> 00:44:26,640
already probably 1 a.m. on your time so

808
00:44:26,640 --> 00:44:29,430
sure any questions coming up you'll be

809
00:44:29,430 --> 00:44:30,720
able to like just go through that

810
00:44:30,720 --> 00:44:34,470
tomorrow or the day after I really liked

811
00:44:34,470 --> 00:44:36,809
the ending part maybe a few slides back

812
00:44:36,809 --> 00:44:39,510
I just wanna say with the communities of

813
00:44:39,510 --> 00:44:41,640
practice because I was always thinking

814
00:44:41,640 --> 00:44:45,329
how important security champions are

815
00:44:45,329 --> 00:44:46,850
eternal ganas ations because they

816
00:44:46,850 --> 00:44:49,270
drive you know with the awareness that

817
00:44:49,270 --> 00:44:51,560
kind of like the commitment to security

818
00:44:51,560 --> 00:44:53,300
and kind of like make that an agenda and

819
00:44:53,300 --> 00:44:56,060
cultural change in an organization when

820
00:44:56,060 --> 00:44:58,280
is your your idea of like you know let's

821
00:44:58,280 --> 00:45:00,320
let's create a what's up around it maybe

822
00:45:00,320 --> 00:45:01,910
some other people are interested let's

823
00:45:01,910 --> 00:45:03,050
you know let's talk about it for looks

824
00:45:03,050 --> 00:45:05,600
to lunch & Learn sessions I really like

825
00:45:05,600 --> 00:45:07,100
that so that's definitely taking it to

826
00:45:07,100 --> 00:45:08,810
the next level and that's gonna be a key

827
00:45:08,810 --> 00:45:10,700
takeaway for me for me from from these

828
00:45:10,700 --> 00:45:13,490
sessions so thank you so much it's thank

829
00:45:13,490 --> 00:45:18,440
you very much all right so we're gonna
