00:01:50,070 --> 00:01:52,020
this presentation I am currently a

50
00:01:52,020 --> 00:01:54,240
sheltered in place in Michigan I'd

51
00:01:54,240 --> 00:01:56,159
normally live in New York it's kind of a

52
00:01:56,159 --> 00:01:58,680
long story I was traveling and thought I

53
00:01:58,680 --> 00:02:00,329
was gonna be gone for a week it's been

54
00:02:00,329 --> 00:02:02,640
about seven like I said it's weird times

55
00:02:02,640 --> 00:02:05,969
for everyone as so you are having a

56
00:02:05,969 --> 00:02:07,259
lovely day wherever you may be

57
00:02:07,259 --> 00:02:08,068
quarantine

58
00:02:08,068 --> 00:02:09,660
or you know if you're watching this

59
00:02:09,660 --> 00:02:11,580
after maybe this is all passed and

60
00:02:11,580 --> 00:02:13,500
everything is just dandy now

61
00:02:13,500 --> 00:02:16,440
this is two of them 2020 and beyond you

62
00:02:16,440 --> 00:02:19,410
know I was laughing at Sam's misstep of

63
00:02:19,410 --> 00:02:21,630
sayin 2010 because like what is time

64
00:02:21,630 --> 00:02:25,260
really anymore 20 of us know but this is

65
00:02:25,260 --> 00:02:27,210
kind of B going to talk about the modern

66
00:02:27,210 --> 00:02:28,590
landscape of two-factor authentication

67
00:02:28,590 --> 00:02:30,390
and where we can see it going in the

68
00:02:30,390 --> 00:02:33,180
future and a lot of this is inspired by

69
00:02:33,180 --> 00:02:34,890
a lot of the discussion around

70
00:02:34,890 --> 00:02:36,900
two-factor authentication these days and

71
00:02:36,900 --> 00:02:38,400
I haven't stopped thinking about this

72
00:02:38,400 --> 00:02:39,930
tweet for a couple of months now and

73
00:02:39,930 --> 00:02:41,940
this is from a security researcher named

74
00:02:41,940 --> 00:02:43,770
Troy hunt he is the creator of this

75
00:02:43,770 --> 00:02:46,350
website having been owned it's a service

76
00:02:46,350 --> 00:02:48,330
that compiles data breaches and lets you

77
00:02:48,330 --> 00:02:49,980
know if your email or password has been

78
00:02:49,980 --> 00:02:52,860
breached and the reality in 2020 is that

79
00:02:52,860 --> 00:02:55,170
we basically expect legitimate email

80
00:02:55,170 --> 00:02:56,580
addresses to have been seen in data

81
00:02:56,580 --> 00:02:59,040
breaches I checked mine yesterday and my

82
00:02:59,040 --> 00:03:01,170
main email address has been seen in 12

83
00:03:01,170 --> 00:03:03,510
data breaches you know that's like no

84
00:03:03,510 --> 00:03:06,330
fault of my own hopefully but this is

85
00:03:06,330 --> 00:03:08,430
just the reality of the world that we

86
00:03:08,430 --> 00:03:10,440
live in now that we are so own that we

87
00:03:10,440 --> 00:03:12,570
expect the legitimate things to be you

88
00:03:12,570 --> 00:03:14,670
know breached and that kind of thing and

89
00:03:14,670 --> 00:03:16,410
Troy's project proves that simple

90
00:03:16,410 --> 00:03:19,140
passwords like 1 3 3 4 or 5 6 are still

91
00:03:19,140 --> 00:03:21,360
incredibly common and even complex

92
00:03:21,360 --> 00:03:23,489
passwords aren't secure if they're being

93
00:03:23,489 --> 00:03:25,230
reused around the web that's because

94
00:03:25,230 --> 00:03:27,690
when people get access to data breaches

95
00:03:27,690 --> 00:03:29,700
they can have combinations of your

96
00:03:29,700 --> 00:03:31,709
username and password pairs if you're

97
00:03:31,709 --> 00:03:33,930
reusing those around the web attackers

98
00:03:33,930 --> 00:03:35,700
will use a process called credential

99
00:03:35,700 --> 00:03:37,860
stuffing to try to log into sensitive

100
00:03:37,860 --> 00:03:39,420
accounts and get other information about

101
00:03:39,420 --> 00:03:42,390
you or buy things under your name using

102
00:03:42,390 --> 00:03:44,010
your stored credit cards and that kind

103
00:03:44,010 --> 00:03:46,290
of stuff and this is the problem with

104
00:03:46,290 --> 00:03:47,790
passwords is that passwords are no

105
00:03:47,790 --> 00:03:50,519
longer enough and that's what we're here

106
00:03:50,519 --> 00:03:52,050
to discuss today this reality where

107
00:03:52,050 --> 00:03:54,209
we're so own that we can't rely on

108
00:03:54,209 --> 00:03:56,700
passwords anymore we have to start

109
00:03:56,700 --> 00:03:57,959
looking at things like two-factor

110
00:03:57,959 --> 00:03:59,489
authentication to help us stay more

111
00:03:59,489 --> 00:04:01,590
secure and help our customers and the

112
00:04:01,590 --> 00:04:03,150
users of our applications stay more

113
00:04:03,150 --> 00:04:05,310
secure and how we can evaluate the

114
00:04:05,310 --> 00:04:06,810
different options available because for

115
00:04:06,810 --> 00:04:08,160
our different channels that you can use

116
00:04:08,160 --> 00:04:09,480
and there's different trade-offs between

117
00:04:09,480 --> 00:04:10,920
those channels and that's a lot of what

118
00:04:10,920 --> 00:04:14,550
I'm going to be talking about today so

119
00:04:14,550 --> 00:04:16,290
my name is Kelly Robinson and I've been

120
00:04:16,290 --> 00:04:18,630
working at Twilio for about three years

121
00:04:18,630 --> 00:04:20,880
I specifically support Twilio as account

122
00:04:20,880 --> 00:04:23,070
security products for things like verify

123
00:04:23,070 --> 00:04:25,710
and lookup for phone verification email

124
00:04:25,710 --> 00:04:27,110
verification use

125
00:04:27,110 --> 00:04:29,240
verification we also have a phone

126
00:04:29,240 --> 00:04:31,310
intelligence API that does some that has

127
00:04:31,310 --> 00:04:33,110
a lot of like security implications so

128
00:04:33,110 --> 00:04:35,419
Twilio is a company overall you might be

129
00:04:35,419 --> 00:04:37,280
familiar with for things like its

130
00:04:37,280 --> 00:04:39,860
communications API so kind of raw

131
00:04:39,860 --> 00:04:42,259
communication channels like SMS voice

132
00:04:42,259 --> 00:04:45,800
calling email fax video we've been a lot

133
00:04:45,800 --> 00:04:47,629
of interest in or video API this month

134
00:04:47,629 --> 00:04:50,150
for some strange reason but I

135
00:04:50,150 --> 00:04:51,500
specifically support our account

136
00:04:51,500 --> 00:04:53,689
security products if you are familiar

137
00:04:53,689 --> 00:04:55,520
with authy Twilio acquired of--they

138
00:04:55,520 --> 00:04:57,620
about five years ago and so i've been

139
00:04:57,620 --> 00:04:58,849
working on the team that's kind of like

140
00:04:58,849 --> 00:05:00,680
grown out of that acquisition around

141
00:05:00,680 --> 00:05:02,870
user verification identity and

142
00:05:02,870 --> 00:05:05,569
authentication so I spend a lot of my

143
00:05:05,569 --> 00:05:06,680
time thinking about two-factor

144
00:05:06,680 --> 00:05:08,539
authentication and a good chunk of my

145
00:05:08,539 --> 00:05:10,909
time is spent educating developers about

146
00:05:10,909 --> 00:05:12,710
security especially when it comes to

147
00:05:12,710 --> 00:05:14,150
authentication the different options you

148
00:05:14,150 --> 00:05:16,939
have available and this talk is going to

149
00:05:16,939 --> 00:05:18,289
incorporate a lot of the things that

150
00:05:18,289 --> 00:05:19,520
I've learned in the last few years

151
00:05:19,520 --> 00:05:21,050
working with our developers and our

152
00:05:21,050 --> 00:05:23,210
customers this talk is not at all about

153
00:05:23,210 --> 00:05:24,680
Twilio it's just kind of about the

154
00:05:24,680 --> 00:05:26,389
things that I have learned from working

155
00:05:26,389 --> 00:05:30,560
on the products that we have so I like

156
00:05:30,560 --> 00:05:31,940
to start off like talking about the

157
00:05:31,940 --> 00:05:33,169
commonalities what we're building

158
00:05:33,169 --> 00:05:36,199
because even if you want to you know ask

159
00:05:36,199 --> 00:05:38,120
me a question like somebody asked me

160
00:05:38,120 --> 00:05:40,370
recently like I'm a small startup what's

161
00:05:40,370 --> 00:05:42,379
you know what should I you start with

162
00:05:42,379 --> 00:05:45,349
like four to Fi and I'm like that really

163
00:05:45,349 --> 00:05:47,000
depends like knowing that you're a small

164
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:49,069
start-up is only like a small part of

165
00:05:49,069 --> 00:05:51,770
the battle here of like knowing what to

166
00:05:51,770 --> 00:05:53,659
recommend to you there's so many

167
00:05:53,659 --> 00:05:56,000
different scenarios that you could be

168
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:57,259
working with the different types of

169
00:05:57,259 --> 00:05:59,870
customers that you have but it's really

170
00:05:59,870 --> 00:06:01,219
challenging there is no

171
00:06:01,219 --> 00:06:03,589
one-size-fits-all solution but I try to

172
00:06:03,589 --> 00:06:05,180
frame this in terms of like the things

173
00:06:05,180 --> 00:06:08,479
that we all have in common and one of

174
00:06:08,479 --> 00:06:09,680
the things that we can assume is that

175
00:06:09,680 --> 00:06:11,659
our authenticated systems that we assume

176
00:06:11,659 --> 00:06:13,669
the user has something of value tied to

177
00:06:13,669 --> 00:06:16,189
their account and we also assume that

178
00:06:16,189 --> 00:06:18,379
that user can only access that value

179
00:06:18,379 --> 00:06:20,839
once they have authenticated and that's

180
00:06:20,839 --> 00:06:23,089
proven by some measure that they are the

181
00:06:23,089 --> 00:06:25,969
owner of their account but finally this

182
00:06:25,969 --> 00:06:27,650
assumption that there's an assumption

183
00:06:27,650 --> 00:06:29,479
that an impersonator could access that

184
00:06:29,479 --> 00:06:31,370
value and that's what we call account

185
00:06:31,370 --> 00:06:33,860
takeover ATO a lot of what we're going

186
00:06:33,860 --> 00:06:35,300
to be thinking about how to make this

187
00:06:35,300 --> 00:06:37,699
step now worth it for the attacker how

188
00:06:37,699 --> 00:06:39,380
to make sure that you're investing the

189
00:06:39,380 --> 00:06:40,409
right amount

190
00:06:40,409 --> 00:06:42,330
technology into a solution that's going

191
00:06:42,330 --> 00:06:44,009
to make sure that this isn't where the

192
00:06:44,009 --> 00:06:46,800
technology or for the attacker but also

193
00:06:46,800 --> 00:06:48,809
not scaring away your users in the

194
00:06:48,809 --> 00:06:51,059
process in the failure of good

195
00:06:51,059 --> 00:06:53,039
authentication often results in this ATO

196
00:06:53,039 --> 00:06:55,739
this is a four billion dollar problem so

197
00:06:55,739 --> 00:06:57,569
the industry is really incentivized to

198
00:06:57,569 --> 00:07:00,539
find a solution here most of the way

199
00:07:00,539 --> 00:07:01,800
that we've done this is through

200
00:07:01,800 --> 00:07:03,539
usernames and passwords the

201
00:07:03,539 --> 00:07:05,369
authentication process but the solution

202
00:07:05,369 --> 00:07:06,389
that we're moving towards and

203
00:07:06,389 --> 00:07:07,559
increasingly is moving away from

204
00:07:07,559 --> 00:07:09,419
passwords or at least adding a second

205
00:07:09,419 --> 00:07:11,759
layer on top of that and we talked about

206
00:07:11,759 --> 00:07:13,469
multi-factor authentication or

207
00:07:13,469 --> 00:07:15,389
two-factor authentication I'll be using

208
00:07:15,389 --> 00:07:18,179
this relatively interchangeably a factor

209
00:07:18,179 --> 00:07:20,099
can be any one of these three things and

210
00:07:20,099 --> 00:07:22,229
using any two of these factors means

211
00:07:22,229 --> 00:07:23,039
that you're using two-factor

212
00:07:23,039 --> 00:07:25,589
authentication this is slightly

213
00:07:25,589 --> 00:07:27,899
different from 2-step authentication so

214
00:07:27,899 --> 00:07:29,849
sometimes you might have a account

215
00:07:29,849 --> 00:07:31,529
that's protected with both a password

216
00:07:31,529 --> 00:07:33,539
and a pin that's actually going to be

217
00:07:33,539 --> 00:07:35,819
2-step authentication because it's only

218
00:07:35,819 --> 00:07:38,309
using two things you know to knowledge

219
00:07:38,309 --> 00:07:40,829
passwords instead of using something you

220
00:07:40,829 --> 00:07:42,419
know like a password and something that

221
00:07:42,419 --> 00:07:44,039
you have like a mobile phone or a

222
00:07:44,039 --> 00:07:47,189
physical key inherence is the third type

223
00:07:47,189 --> 00:07:49,139
of factories are biometrics saying that

224
00:07:49,139 --> 00:07:50,579
you are this could be something like

225
00:07:50,579 --> 00:07:54,059
face ID or something like a fingerprint

226
00:07:54,059 --> 00:07:56,849
or voice recognition or something like

227
00:07:56,849 --> 00:07:58,129
that

228
00:07:58,129 --> 00:08:00,269
the second factors that we're gonna be

229
00:08:00,269 --> 00:08:02,039
talking about today all fall into this

230
00:08:02,039 --> 00:08:04,079
possession category so I just wanted to

231
00:08:04,079 --> 00:08:05,759
frame that knowledge is usually what

232
00:08:05,759 --> 00:08:07,319
we're building on top of and there's

233
00:08:07,319 --> 00:08:09,089
some challenges with implementing on

234
00:08:09,089 --> 00:08:10,829
biometrics usually you want to make sure

235
00:08:10,829 --> 00:08:12,569
that you're implementing that at a

236
00:08:12,569 --> 00:08:15,569
device level so that the biometric

237
00:08:15,569 --> 00:08:16,949
information that you're collecting is

238
00:08:16,949 --> 00:08:19,110
not getting stored on some kind of

239
00:08:19,110 --> 00:08:21,089
server that could be accessed you know

240
00:08:21,089 --> 00:08:22,979
obviously not intentionally but you

241
00:08:22,979 --> 00:08:24,509
don't want biometric data I getting

242
00:08:24,509 --> 00:08:26,849
hacked or leaving a device because you

243
00:08:26,849 --> 00:08:28,409
can't change that information there's

244
00:08:28,409 --> 00:08:29,819
not really look at the account recovery

245
00:08:29,819 --> 00:08:33,630
path for biometrics so let's look at

246
00:08:33,630 --> 00:08:34,889
some of the trade-offs of the different

247
00:08:34,889 --> 00:08:36,208
factors that fall into this position

248
00:08:36,208 --> 00:08:38,370
category we're gonna start with s in

249
00:08:38,370 --> 00:08:41,009
that space to FA and so only huge

250
00:08:41,009 --> 00:08:42,688
benefits of s in that space to F it's

251
00:08:42,688 --> 00:08:44,490
just that it's really easy to on board

252
00:08:44,490 --> 00:08:47,220
people and I can't stress how important

253
00:08:47,220 --> 00:08:50,759
this is because there's a really huge

254
00:08:50,759 --> 00:08:52,829
burden to getting people to turn on to

255
00:08:52,829 --> 00:08:53,730
FA

256
00:08:53,730 --> 00:08:55,410
and even if you make somebody download

257
00:08:55,410 --> 00:08:56,790
an additional app or take additional

258
00:08:56,790 --> 00:08:58,560
steps that's going to decrease the

259
00:08:58,560 --> 00:09:01,199
number of people to turn on to FA and to

260
00:09:01,199 --> 00:09:03,240
FA isn't really worth anything if nobody

261
00:09:03,240 --> 00:09:03,959
uses it

262
00:09:03,959 --> 00:09:05,579
and so one of the reasons that companies

263
00:09:05,579 --> 00:09:08,160
still love SMS based to FA is because it

264
00:09:08,160 --> 00:09:09,570
does have really easy to user I'm

265
00:09:09,570 --> 00:09:12,600
working so the familiar interface but

266
00:09:12,600 --> 00:09:13,980
like according to a recent Pew study

267
00:09:13,980 --> 00:09:15,899
over ninety percent of Americans have a

268
00:09:15,899 --> 00:09:17,579
phone capable of receiving text messages

269
00:09:17,579 --> 00:09:19,740
and so this makes it really easy for

270
00:09:19,740 --> 00:09:23,220
people to start using SMS face to FA but

271
00:09:23,220 --> 00:09:25,920
SMS is not a secure channel and you

272
00:09:25,920 --> 00:09:27,329
might be familiar with this and somebody

273
00:09:27,329 --> 00:09:29,970
that's interested in DEP SEC Ops there's

274
00:09:29,970 --> 00:09:31,980
something known as the ss7 vulnerability

275
00:09:31,980 --> 00:09:34,740
this is the signaling system 7 and this

276
00:09:34,740 --> 00:09:37,589
is an oval 'nor ability in telecom inter

277
00:09:37,589 --> 00:09:40,199
carrier telecom switching this allows

278
00:09:40,199 --> 00:09:41,550
you to impersonate a carrier and

279
00:09:41,550 --> 00:09:42,899
basically route messages that are

280
00:09:42,899 --> 00:09:45,870
intended to you for you to yourself so

281
00:09:45,870 --> 00:09:47,160
this requires a little bit of technical

282
00:09:47,160 --> 00:09:48,449
know-how but it's definitely possible

283
00:09:48,449 --> 00:09:51,449
and we see definitely like actors using

284
00:09:51,449 --> 00:09:53,339
this and any kind of people that are

285
00:09:53,339 --> 00:09:56,070
motivated enough to get into a

286
00:09:56,070 --> 00:09:57,690
man-in-the-middle or commit a madam in

287
00:09:57,690 --> 00:09:59,760
the middle attack you can use ss7 for

288
00:09:59,760 --> 00:10:04,110
that because you know telecom and text

289
00:10:04,110 --> 00:10:07,050
messages are not and encrypted but

290
00:10:07,050 --> 00:10:08,610
arguably one of the more common things

291
00:10:08,610 --> 00:10:10,760
that we've been seeing with SMS as a

292
00:10:10,760 --> 00:10:13,050
attack vector is something called sim

293
00:10:13,050 --> 00:10:14,519
swapping and this is where you use

294
00:10:14,519 --> 00:10:16,560
social engineering or bribery to get a

295
00:10:16,560 --> 00:10:18,990
SIM card you know you get my SIM card

296
00:10:18,990 --> 00:10:21,329
set to you and so if you want to go talk

297
00:10:21,329 --> 00:10:23,250
to t-mobile and convince them that you

298
00:10:23,250 --> 00:10:25,649
are Kelly Robinson and get my sim card

299
00:10:25,649 --> 00:10:27,750
reset and sent to you all of a sudden

300
00:10:27,750 --> 00:10:29,399
you have access to all my text messages

301
00:10:29,399 --> 00:10:31,980
and we've seen this happen you know it

302
00:10:31,980 --> 00:10:33,529
was really popular a couple of years ago

303
00:10:33,529 --> 00:10:35,430
especially when people were bragging

304
00:10:35,430 --> 00:10:36,959
about how many Bitcoin they had on the

305
00:10:36,959 --> 00:10:39,269
internet so pro tip didn't brag about

306
00:10:39,269 --> 00:10:40,410
how many Bitcoin you have on the

307
00:10:40,410 --> 00:10:42,000
internet but this is something that

308
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:44,310
people can can you use to get access to

309
00:10:44,310 --> 00:10:47,430
your text messages and your 2fa codes so

310
00:10:47,430 --> 00:10:49,800
SMS is super convenient as the method of

311
00:10:49,800 --> 00:10:54,870
2fa but it's not really that secure the

312
00:10:54,870 --> 00:10:55,829
next method that we're going to talk

313
00:10:55,829 --> 00:10:57,899
about is what we soft tokens this is

314
00:10:57,899 --> 00:11:00,240
also known as TOTP or time-based

315
00:11:00,240 --> 00:11:03,149
one-time passwords and this is a way to

316
00:11:03,149 --> 00:11:05,699
generate tokens based on algorithm and

317
00:11:05,699 --> 00:11:07,580
you would use this with an hour

318
00:11:07,580 --> 00:11:09,440
location like google authenticator or

319
00:11:09,440 --> 00:11:11,930
of--they and the inputs to this

320
00:11:11,930 --> 00:11:13,880
algorithm are a secret key that gets

321
00:11:13,880 --> 00:11:16,520
shared when you set up an account and

322
00:11:16,520 --> 00:11:18,230
your system time and then those get put

323
00:11:18,230 --> 00:11:20,060
through a one-way function and out pops

324
00:11:20,060 --> 00:11:22,460
the truncated two again and symmetric

325
00:11:22,460 --> 00:11:23,780
key cryptography is gonna offer

326
00:11:23,780 --> 00:11:26,900
additional security compared s and s but

327
00:11:26,900 --> 00:11:28,460
if somebody gets access to that shared

328
00:11:28,460 --> 00:11:30,410
secret the method it can be easily

329
00:11:30,410 --> 00:11:33,110
compromised and this you know you might

330
00:11:33,110 --> 00:11:34,340
say that will house somebody getting

331
00:11:34,340 --> 00:11:36,740
access to that shared secret usually the

332
00:11:36,740 --> 00:11:38,360
way that you share that is by scanning a

333
00:11:38,360 --> 00:11:41,930
QR code when you set up your totp gun

334
00:11:41,930 --> 00:11:44,780
whatever app you're using one example of

335
00:11:44,780 --> 00:11:46,790
how this could go right at my last

336
00:11:46,790 --> 00:11:49,280
company the engineering team hadn't

337
00:11:49,280 --> 00:11:51,650
shared credentials for our Amazon

338
00:11:51,650 --> 00:11:54,020
account and one of the ways that we set

339
00:11:54,020 --> 00:11:56,540
that up was we dip up to FA turned on

340
00:11:56,540 --> 00:11:58,820
but we shared the QR code for adding the

341
00:11:58,820 --> 00:12:01,430
two FA in our like shared one password

342
00:12:01,430 --> 00:12:05,210
file and so we were able to scan that

343
00:12:05,210 --> 00:12:07,400
one like me on board a new engineer and

344
00:12:07,400 --> 00:12:09,410
we eventually moved to I am role more

345
00:12:09,410 --> 00:12:11,570
secure things for managing our AWS

346
00:12:11,570 --> 00:12:13,880
account but that was one thing that we

347
00:12:13,880 --> 00:12:15,290
were using to make sure that like

348
00:12:15,290 --> 00:12:16,760
everybody could have access to the two

349
00:12:16,760 --> 00:12:18,410
FA but there was like QR code that was

350
00:12:18,410 --> 00:12:20,480
just kind of sitting around there you

351
00:12:20,480 --> 00:12:21,800
know it was a little bit more security

352
00:12:21,800 --> 00:12:23,240
because it wasn't that one password file

353
00:12:23,240 --> 00:12:25,970
but it's one of those things that it

354
00:12:25,970 --> 00:12:28,160
could get leaked if you are worried

355
00:12:28,160 --> 00:12:30,980
about something like that but TOTP does

356
00:12:30,980 --> 00:12:33,440
offer some distinct advantages because

357
00:12:33,440 --> 00:12:35,270
both of the inputs so that system time

358
00:12:35,270 --> 00:12:37,280
and the secret key are available offline

359
00:12:37,280 --> 00:12:39,440
the entire method is available offline

360
00:12:39,440 --> 00:12:41,840
so that means you can use totp if your

361
00:12:41,840 --> 00:12:44,870
plane didn't buy Wi-Fi access if you're

362
00:12:44,870 --> 00:12:46,910
traveling and you don't have access to

363
00:12:46,910 --> 00:12:49,580
your like SMS messages say you're

364
00:12:49,580 --> 00:12:51,440
traveling in you I mean nobody's

365
00:12:51,440 --> 00:12:53,660
traveling right now but say you'd like

366
00:12:53,660 --> 00:12:56,510
lose access to your to your SMS where

367
00:12:56,510 --> 00:12:58,070
you have a SIM card from another country

368
00:12:58,070 --> 00:12:59,240
or something like that

369
00:12:59,240 --> 00:13:01,280
TOTP works offline that can be really

370
00:13:01,280 --> 00:13:03,500
valuable we've seen this useful

371
00:13:03,500 --> 00:13:05,510
you know like in basements of hospitals

372
00:13:05,510 --> 00:13:07,130
where people might have not have cell

373
00:13:07,130 --> 00:13:09,290
service and if you can't risk you text

374
00:13:09,290 --> 00:13:11,390
messages over Wi-Fi then something like

375
00:13:11,390 --> 00:13:14,380
this can be really useful unfortunately

376
00:13:14,380 --> 00:13:17,330
TOTP does require an app download and

377
00:13:17,330 --> 00:13:19,190
this is one of those things that like it

378
00:13:19,190 --> 00:13:21,139
isn't a huge burden to

379
00:13:21,139 --> 00:13:22,850
some people and to some people that

380
00:13:22,850 --> 00:13:24,920
already have an app like Google

381
00:13:24,920 --> 00:13:26,689
Authenticator authy Microsoft

382
00:13:26,689 --> 00:13:29,149
Authenticator do all of these adopt this

383
00:13:29,149 --> 00:13:31,009
open standards you can use whichever one

384
00:13:31,009 --> 00:13:33,290
you want but getting people to download

385
00:13:33,290 --> 00:13:35,720
the app for the first time it can be a

386
00:13:35,720 --> 00:13:37,790
big hurdle for a lot of people that are

387
00:13:37,790 --> 00:13:40,279
setting up this for the first time and

388
00:13:40,279 --> 00:13:42,439
then I briefly wanted to mention the

389
00:13:42,439 --> 00:13:44,540
expiration user experience here and so

390
00:13:44,540 --> 00:13:46,629
because this is based on system time

391
00:13:46,629 --> 00:13:49,730
there's about you know usually these

392
00:13:49,730 --> 00:13:51,739
expire and these tokens expire in about

393
00:13:51,739 --> 00:13:54,709
thirty seconds and in a study on the

394
00:13:54,709 --> 00:13:57,579
usability of different to FA factors

395
00:13:57,579 --> 00:13:59,779
researchers found that two-thirds of

396
00:13:59,779 --> 00:14:02,029
participants using totp via Google

397
00:14:02,029 --> 00:14:04,100
Authenticator had problems entering the

398
00:14:04,100 --> 00:14:06,470
six digit code before it timed out so

399
00:14:06,470 --> 00:14:08,089
again like if you're used to using this

400
00:14:08,089 --> 00:14:09,829
method that might not be a problem for

401
00:14:09,829 --> 00:14:11,299
you but you might want to consider the

402
00:14:11,299 --> 00:14:13,249
expiration you access something you have

403
00:14:13,249 --> 00:14:15,350
users that might be a bit slower to

404
00:14:15,350 --> 00:14:17,839
enter codes or not used to using the

405
00:14:17,839 --> 00:14:21,230
second factor as often so we see a lot

406
00:14:21,230 --> 00:14:23,660
more security conscious companies adding

407
00:14:23,660 --> 00:14:25,730
TOTP at the 2fa option because it's

408
00:14:25,730 --> 00:14:28,220
definitely more secure than SMS for

409
00:14:28,220 --> 00:14:29,480
people that might be worried about

410
00:14:29,480 --> 00:14:32,769
getting swapped or taken over via SMS

411
00:14:32,769 --> 00:14:35,839
allowing those users to turn off SMS as

412
00:14:35,839 --> 00:14:37,850
a second factor and opt in to something

413
00:14:37,850 --> 00:14:39,829
the TOTP is going to be something that

414
00:14:39,829 --> 00:14:41,959
you could look into to really delight

415
00:14:41,959 --> 00:14:45,860
your security conscious users the next

416
00:14:45,860 --> 00:14:47,239
thing that I want to talk about is push

417
00:14:47,239 --> 00:14:50,149
off indication and users love this

418
00:14:50,149 --> 00:14:51,709
because it's so low friction you can

419
00:14:51,709 --> 00:14:53,600
approve or deny a login request directly

420
00:14:53,600 --> 00:14:55,459
from your SmartWatch and they're also

421
00:14:55,459 --> 00:14:57,649
using asymmetric key cryptography which

422
00:14:57,649 --> 00:14:59,239
means that you have two keys and one's

423
00:14:59,239 --> 00:15:00,739
only ever going to be stored on your

424
00:15:00,739 --> 00:15:02,449
device so you don't have to worry about

425
00:15:02,449 --> 00:15:05,029
leaking a shared secret like you might

426
00:15:05,029 --> 00:15:07,759
with see OTP and this is also the only

427
00:15:07,759 --> 00:15:10,009
form of 2fa that adds the option to

428
00:15:10,009 --> 00:15:12,709
explicitly denial log in but

429
00:15:12,709 --> 00:15:14,689
unfortunately push authentication is so

430
00:15:14,689 --> 00:15:15,559
low friction

431
00:15:15,559 --> 00:15:16,939
you could easily approve an

432
00:15:16,939 --> 00:15:18,919
authorization request just to get rid of

433
00:15:18,919 --> 00:15:20,869
it so if you think somebody is like has

434
00:15:20,869 --> 00:15:22,850
breached your first factor and is trying

435
00:15:22,850 --> 00:15:24,439
to do a hack into your account in the

436
00:15:24,439 --> 00:15:25,879
middle of the night and you keep getting

437
00:15:25,879 --> 00:15:27,559
a notification on your phone this is

438
00:15:27,559 --> 00:15:29,839
like it's buzzing because you haven't

439
00:15:29,839 --> 00:15:31,549
turned on Do Not Disturb and you just

440
00:15:31,549 --> 00:15:33,020
want to get rid of it

441
00:15:33,020 --> 00:15:34,430
might unintentionally approve the

442
00:15:34,430 --> 00:15:35,870
request because it doesn't really take

443
00:15:35,870 --> 00:15:38,510
that much effort to approve it across

444
00:15:38,510 --> 00:15:41,840
our cost like this the that could

445
00:15:41,840 --> 00:15:44,270
problem if you're worried about low

446
00:15:44,270 --> 00:15:45,890
friction this is if you really want to

447
00:15:45,890 --> 00:15:46,820
make sure the people are being

448
00:15:46,820 --> 00:15:48,830
intentional about having somebody enter

449
00:15:48,830 --> 00:15:50,630
code is another way to do that

450
00:15:50,630 --> 00:15:52,970
push authentication also requires a

451
00:15:52,970 --> 00:15:56,000
special app like coffee or duo you could

452
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:57,160
also build this into your own

453
00:15:57,160 --> 00:16:00,140
application and like to your TP getting

454
00:16:00,140 --> 00:16:02,000
users to download another app it's

455
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:03,650
always going to be a challenge I think

456
00:16:03,650 --> 00:16:04,700
where we've seen this be really

457
00:16:04,700 --> 00:16:07,370
successful is with app first companies

458
00:16:07,370 --> 00:16:09,740
or if you have an app that or if you

459
00:16:09,740 --> 00:16:11,060
have a large portion of your user base

460
00:16:11,060 --> 00:16:13,460
that already has a mobile app installed

461
00:16:13,460 --> 00:16:15,320
so Google prompt is a good example of

462
00:16:15,320 --> 00:16:18,550
where if I'm trying to authenticate a

463
00:16:18,550 --> 00:16:21,890
gmail session on my desktop I can use

464
00:16:21,890 --> 00:16:24,620
the Gmail app on my phone as the

465
00:16:24,620 --> 00:16:26,180
Authenticator and use the push

466
00:16:26,180 --> 00:16:28,250
authentication as a way to verify that

467
00:16:28,250 --> 00:16:32,750
I'm logging in on the desktop so this

468
00:16:32,750 --> 00:16:33,800
seems great it's really

469
00:16:33,800 --> 00:16:35,630
cryptographically secure it might be

470
00:16:35,630 --> 00:16:37,490
good for some use cases but it might

471
00:16:37,490 --> 00:16:39,950
also be too too convenient perhaps and

472
00:16:39,950 --> 00:16:42,290
like the the one of the other downsides

473
00:16:42,290 --> 00:16:43,760
of this is just sort of require a little

474
00:16:43,760 --> 00:16:47,620
bit more konima and a little bit more

475
00:16:47,620 --> 00:16:52,400
development time to get this set up the

476
00:16:52,400 --> 00:16:53,630
next one that I want to talk about is

477
00:16:53,630 --> 00:16:56,060
web often also known as u2f as a

478
00:16:56,060 --> 00:16:58,580
universal second factor web off is

479
00:16:58,580 --> 00:17:00,740
another part of the photo to spec I know

480
00:17:00,740 --> 00:17:03,200
too specifically to get rid of passwords

481
00:17:03,200 --> 00:17:04,849
so this is all about like password lists

482
00:17:04,849 --> 00:17:07,209
authentication so this isn't necessarily

483
00:17:07,209 --> 00:17:10,160
going to be always a second factor it

484
00:17:10,160 --> 00:17:12,470
could be replacing the first factor but

485
00:17:12,470 --> 00:17:14,930
we still use a lot as a supplement to

486
00:17:14,930 --> 00:17:18,230
passwords and the good thing about web

487
00:17:18,230 --> 00:17:20,140
off then is that its fishing resistant

488
00:17:20,140 --> 00:17:22,430
it offers a really high level of

489
00:17:22,430 --> 00:17:23,839
security with a symmetric key

490
00:17:23,839 --> 00:17:25,270
cryptography like push authentication

491
00:17:25,270 --> 00:17:28,490
but it's also an open standard like TOTP

492
00:17:28,490 --> 00:17:30,740
so the biggest drawbacks with this right

493
00:17:30,740 --> 00:17:32,480
now is that it's relatively new still

494
00:17:32,480 --> 00:17:34,820
and setup can be kind of clunky so you

495
00:17:34,820 --> 00:17:36,440
need an Authenticator that's compatible

496
00:17:36,440 --> 00:17:38,330
with the standard and things like u2

497
00:17:38,330 --> 00:17:40,040
keys which are pictured here aren't

498
00:17:40,040 --> 00:17:41,660
exactly cheap and it's definitely not

499
00:17:41,660 --> 00:17:43,670
reasonable to expect every user your

500
00:17:43,670 --> 00:17:45,860
application will have one especially if

501
00:17:45,860 --> 00:17:46,750
you're dealing with it

502
00:17:46,750 --> 00:17:51,100
tomber application so as more devices

503
00:17:51,100 --> 00:17:52,870
that we already have like our phones

504
00:17:52,870 --> 00:17:55,360
start to adopt a standard and so Google

505
00:17:55,360 --> 00:17:57,100
is experimenting with this with Android

506
00:17:57,100 --> 00:17:59,830
phones so any Android phone can be used

507
00:17:59,830 --> 00:18:01,990
as a move off and compatible on icater

508
00:18:01,990 --> 00:18:04,510
but right now it's still only for Google

509
00:18:04,510 --> 00:18:07,930
Sites but as Android phones start to be

510
00:18:07,930 --> 00:18:09,760
like a more common Authenticator for any

511
00:18:09,760 --> 00:18:11,710
site we'll start to see an uptake in

512
00:18:11,710 --> 00:18:13,810
this factor currently it's still more

513
00:18:13,810 --> 00:18:15,940
popular within companies and so your IP

514
00:18:15,940 --> 00:18:18,310
department could hand you a you Biki or

515
00:18:18,310 --> 00:18:20,020
Google Titan key or something like that

516
00:18:20,020 --> 00:18:22,450
or they can mail you one the other thing

517
00:18:22,450 --> 00:18:24,280
with these is the account recovery is a

518
00:18:24,280 --> 00:18:26,500
lot more challenging if you lose the key

519
00:18:26,500 --> 00:18:29,890
you're kind of Sol and this is be a

520
00:18:29,890 --> 00:18:31,630
problem because you know especially for

521
00:18:31,630 --> 00:18:33,430
consumer applications which is a lot of

522
00:18:33,430 --> 00:18:34,660
what we did with that offi

523
00:18:34,660 --> 00:18:37,480
and you know you want to make sure that

524
00:18:37,480 --> 00:18:39,250
there's a path to recovery there and

525
00:18:39,250 --> 00:18:40,630
there's a path to getting people that

526
00:18:40,630 --> 00:18:42,450
you might not have that kind of

527
00:18:42,450 --> 00:18:44,710
employer-employee trusted relationship

528
00:18:44,710 --> 00:18:46,690
with a path to getting them back into

529
00:18:46,690 --> 00:18:50,740
their accounts so I do want to back to

530
00:18:50,740 --> 00:18:52,180
some of this up with some quantitative

531
00:18:52,180 --> 00:18:54,370
data and I think to do that we need to

532
00:18:54,370 --> 00:18:55,810
think a little bit more granularly about

533
00:18:55,810 --> 00:18:57,340
how we're measuring the effectiveness of

534
00:18:57,340 --> 00:18:59,860
2fa and I want to define some of this in

535
00:18:59,860 --> 00:19:02,080
this lifecycle approach and so I already

536
00:19:02,080 --> 00:19:04,270
mentioned the account recovery there but

537
00:19:04,270 --> 00:19:05,800
you also have to think about onboarding

538
00:19:05,800 --> 00:19:08,050
so there is some friction for setup with

539
00:19:08,050 --> 00:19:10,120
some of these factors there's also the

540
00:19:10,120 --> 00:19:11,860
friction for ongoing use the user

541
00:19:11,860 --> 00:19:13,780
experience as people continue to use

542
00:19:13,780 --> 00:19:16,090
this there is also the friction for

543
00:19:16,090 --> 00:19:17,680
replacing the loss factor like I was

544
00:19:17,680 --> 00:19:20,500
talking about with you the keys and you

545
00:19:20,500 --> 00:19:23,590
become one of those things and I you to

546
00:19:23,590 --> 00:19:27,100
F&Y both on our will those things where

547
00:19:27,100 --> 00:19:28,780
the set up and the recovery can be

548
00:19:28,780 --> 00:19:31,000
pretty challenging so from a study in

549
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:33,130
2018 that focused Stingley I need the

550
00:19:33,130 --> 00:19:35,080
keys not offline overall but it was just

551
00:19:35,080 --> 00:19:37,450
on you bikies the statics success vary a

552
00:19:37,450 --> 00:19:38,920
lot depending on the platform that you

553
00:19:38,920 --> 00:19:41,890
saw and so Google when people were using

554
00:19:41,890 --> 00:19:44,740
or setting up you biddies for Google 83%

555
00:19:44,740 --> 00:19:46,690
of people were successful versus only

556
00:19:46,690 --> 00:19:49,390
32% of people or successful on Facebook

557
00:19:49,390 --> 00:19:51,850
so this study was from 2018 if you've

558
00:19:51,850 --> 00:19:53,740
been following about then you know a lot

559
00:19:53,740 --> 00:19:56,590
has changed since 2018 but I do think

560
00:19:56,590 --> 00:19:58,000
it's a really interesting look at how

561
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:00,860
onboarding UX can impact users

562
00:20:00,860 --> 00:20:02,990
and make sure that they can either be

563
00:20:02,990 --> 00:20:04,820
successful more at the time like they

564
00:20:04,820 --> 00:20:06,590
were with Google or less successful like

565
00:20:06,590 --> 00:20:08,510
they were with Facebook or even with

566
00:20:08,510 --> 00:20:10,790
Windows authorization tool where people

567
00:20:10,790 --> 00:20:12,200
were able to lock themselves out of

568
00:20:12,200 --> 00:20:14,270
their computer because that tool didn't

569
00:20:14,270 --> 00:20:16,400
allow them or didn't force them to do a

570
00:20:16,400 --> 00:20:18,830
complete authentication before they

571
00:20:18,830 --> 00:20:22,000
turned on the factor

572
00:20:23,260 --> 00:20:25,880
so moving on usability one measure of

573
00:20:25,880 --> 00:20:27,710
usability that we see is time to

574
00:20:27,710 --> 00:20:28,970
authentic pain and this is really

575
00:20:28,970 --> 00:20:30,920
important to some people but it's just

576
00:20:30,920 --> 00:20:34,280
one measure of usability here and so in

577
00:20:34,280 --> 00:20:35,870
terms of time to authentic hey I don't

578
00:20:35,870 --> 00:20:38,180
think this is really that surprising you

579
00:20:38,180 --> 00:20:40,070
to F and push had the fastest median

580
00:20:40,070 --> 00:20:41,960
times to off that P and so when you

581
00:20:41,960 --> 00:20:44,150
compare this to something like SMS do a

582
00:20:44,150 --> 00:20:45,950
research found that I can save people

583
00:20:45,950 --> 00:20:48,320
over 13 minutes every year depending on

584
00:20:48,320 --> 00:20:53,450
how often they're logging in but the

585
00:20:53,450 --> 00:20:56,120
system usability scale or sus is another

586
00:20:56,120 --> 00:20:57,740
standard measurement used by researchers

587
00:20:57,740 --> 00:21:00,200
to kind of see how much people prefer

588
00:21:00,200 --> 00:21:02,150
different types of authenticators and

589
00:21:02,150 --> 00:21:03,710
all the methods actually had a pretty

590
00:21:03,710 --> 00:21:06,230
good usability sort totp came out on top

591
00:21:06,230 --> 00:21:09,920
of the actual factors this is compared

592
00:21:09,920 --> 00:21:14,150
to passwords which I is not using any

593
00:21:14,150 --> 00:21:16,130
too FA the participants still prefer

594
00:21:16,130 --> 00:21:18,650
just using passwords you know looking at

595
00:21:18,650 --> 00:21:20,810
the actual second factor as totp was

596
00:21:20,810 --> 00:21:22,730
their favorite and this actually

597
00:21:22,730 --> 00:21:24,260
surprised me because this was the same

598
00:21:24,260 --> 00:21:26,270
studying the show that 2/3 of the users

599
00:21:26,270 --> 00:21:28,580
had issues with that timeout but that

600
00:21:28,580 --> 00:21:32,260
didn't seem to affect their rating here

601
00:21:32,260 --> 00:21:34,370
there is somewhat of an inverse

602
00:21:34,370 --> 00:21:36,530
relationship between the sus chords and

603
00:21:36,530 --> 00:21:39,500
the time to authenticate though because

604
00:21:39,500 --> 00:21:41,090
all the methods had a pretty good

605
00:21:41,090 --> 00:21:42,770
usability score but I thought was

606
00:21:42,770 --> 00:21:44,270
interesting and the researchers actually

607
00:21:44,270 --> 00:21:46,460
pointing this out that push you to F had

608
00:21:46,460 --> 00:21:49,520
some of lower sus fours and this is

609
00:21:49,520 --> 00:21:51,500
France coming from some of the fastest

610
00:21:51,500 --> 00:21:53,450
authenticators and so they observed that

611
00:21:53,450 --> 00:21:54,800
faster authentication does not

612
00:21:54,800 --> 00:21:56,720
necessarily mean higher usability

613
00:21:56,720 --> 00:21:58,670
there's some theories behind this you

614
00:21:58,670 --> 00:22:00,470
know I kind of mentioned that friction

615
00:22:00,470 --> 00:22:02,240
is something that we kind of expect with

616
00:22:02,240 --> 00:22:04,940
authentication this is something that we

617
00:22:04,940 --> 00:22:06,830
might be used to and maybe we'll start

618
00:22:06,830 --> 00:22:09,290
to move away with this as we start to

619
00:22:09,290 --> 00:22:11,750
adopt more of these asymmetric key

620
00:22:11,750 --> 00:22:14,520
cryptography methods that are

621
00:22:14,520 --> 00:22:16,410
really offering additional security but

622
00:22:16,410 --> 00:22:18,660
our solo friction there are other ways

623
00:22:18,660 --> 00:22:21,420
that you can do this you could use u2f

624
00:22:21,420 --> 00:22:22,950
in a way that does require you to enter

625
00:22:22,950 --> 00:22:26,430
a PIN to authorize so there's ways that

626
00:22:26,430 --> 00:22:27,960
you can start to work with these factors

627
00:22:27,960 --> 00:22:30,020
that introduce a little bit of friction

628
00:22:30,020 --> 00:22:32,010
but I thought this is an interesting

629
00:22:32,010 --> 00:22:36,390
observation but there are a lot of

630
00:22:36,390 --> 00:22:37,830
trade-offs between these different

631
00:22:37,830 --> 00:22:39,420
options there's a lot of different

632
00:22:39,420 --> 00:22:41,970
levels of security here but I think it's

633
00:22:41,970 --> 00:22:43,620
important to note especially for our

634
00:22:43,620 --> 00:22:45,720
security focused audience you know I get

635
00:22:45,720 --> 00:22:47,280
into debates with people a lot about

636
00:22:47,280 --> 00:22:49,110
like SMS should be burned the ground

637
00:22:49,110 --> 00:22:50,610
it's not a secure method of

638
00:22:50,610 --> 00:22:52,590
authentication I see the popular science

639
00:22:52,590 --> 00:22:55,380
magazines reporting this but do you

640
00:22:55,380 --> 00:22:56,730
think it's important to note that SMS

641
00:22:56,730 --> 00:22:59,040
face to FA is still better than no to FA

642
00:22:59,040 --> 00:23:01,110
at all and know that like this is

643
00:23:01,110 --> 00:23:03,810
something that I am easily biased by

644
00:23:03,810 --> 00:23:05,550
like I work at a company that offers

645
00:23:05,550 --> 00:23:07,380
this is a product and so I'm constantly

646
00:23:07,380 --> 00:23:09,210
questioning whether or not this is just

647
00:23:09,210 --> 00:23:12,210
me you know being biased here but while

648
00:23:12,210 --> 00:23:13,830
this is easy for me to say there is

649
00:23:13,830 --> 00:23:16,500
actual research to back me up in a

650
00:23:16,500 --> 00:23:19,350
google study from last men and they

651
00:23:19,350 --> 00:23:21,960
found that an SMS code Center recovery

652
00:23:21,960 --> 00:23:23,730
phone number helps block a hundred

653
00:23:23,730 --> 00:23:27,030
percent of automated BOTS 96% of all

654
00:23:27,030 --> 00:23:30,120
phishing attacks and 76% of targeted

655
00:23:30,120 --> 00:23:32,640
attacks so that's pretty good protection

656
00:23:32,640 --> 00:23:34,800
and it's definitely going to offer

657
00:23:34,800 --> 00:23:36,810
additional security compared to just

658
00:23:36,810 --> 00:23:38,640
using usernames and passwords

659
00:23:38,640 --> 00:23:41,220
so while nurse this is definitely an

660
00:23:41,220 --> 00:23:43,230
insecure method and while I do think

661
00:23:43,230 --> 00:23:44,670
especially depending on what type of

662
00:23:44,670 --> 00:23:46,350
product you're offering you should offer

663
00:23:46,350 --> 00:23:49,530
additional options like TOTP or push you

664
00:23:49,530 --> 00:23:53,490
definitely want to start it's like to

665
00:23:53,490 --> 00:23:55,230
consider the onboarding benefits of

666
00:23:55,230 --> 00:23:57,450
something like SMS as two factor

667
00:23:57,450 --> 00:24:00,810
authentication channel but like I

668
00:24:00,810 --> 00:24:02,580
mentioned before two F isn't really

669
00:24:02,580 --> 00:24:05,280
worth anything unless they're people

670
00:24:05,280 --> 00:24:08,280
actually turn it on and two of the

671
00:24:08,280 --> 00:24:11,010
adoption when it's optional is pretty

672
00:24:11,010 --> 00:24:12,750
abysmal there's you know a few reasons

673
00:24:12,750 --> 00:24:16,440
for that the BYU study from 2019 found

674
00:24:16,440 --> 00:24:18,120
that people were willing to add to F a

675
00:24:18,120 --> 00:24:21,570
if they saw value in the account but 13%

676
00:24:21,570 --> 00:24:22,680
of participants just saw the

677
00:24:22,680 --> 00:24:26,270
inconvenience was too high

678
00:24:26,650 --> 00:24:28,840
and one of the reasons for that as a lot

679
00:24:28,840 --> 00:24:29,980
of people just don't believe that

680
00:24:29,980 --> 00:24:31,570
they're our target and so one of the

681
00:24:31,570 --> 00:24:33,160
research participants said I just don't

682
00:24:33,160 --> 00:24:34,510
think I have anything that people would

683
00:24:34,510 --> 00:24:36,280
want to take from me so I think that's

684
00:24:36,280 --> 00:24:38,110
why I haven't been very worried about it

685
00:24:38,110 --> 00:24:40,270
and this makes sense we all probably

686
00:24:40,270 --> 00:24:42,310
know people in our lives that feel this

687
00:24:42,310 --> 00:24:44,800
way and as people that think about

688
00:24:44,800 --> 00:24:46,840
security that care about security that

689
00:24:46,840 --> 00:24:49,210
work in security you know we understand

690
00:24:49,210 --> 00:24:51,550
the value of some of these additional

691
00:24:51,550 --> 00:24:53,530
measures but the average person might

692
00:24:53,530 --> 00:24:55,420
not and I think it's interesting because

693
00:24:55,420 --> 00:24:56,830
there's been some conflicting research

694
00:24:56,830 --> 00:24:58,240
lately about whether or not people

695
00:24:58,240 --> 00:25:00,960
having been part of a past data breach

696
00:25:00,960 --> 00:25:03,340
actually influences their willingness to

697
00:25:03,340 --> 00:25:06,460
turn on TFA and some people have found

698
00:25:06,460 --> 00:25:08,350
that it does influence their willingness

699
00:25:08,350 --> 00:25:09,520
and some people have found that it has

700
00:25:09,520 --> 00:25:12,070
no effect at all and I think that also

701
00:25:12,070 --> 00:25:13,630
makes sense probably depending on the

702
00:25:13,630 --> 00:25:15,790
person like I mentioned earlier like my

703
00:25:15,790 --> 00:25:17,650
email has been seeing 12 data breaches

704
00:25:17,650 --> 00:25:19,780
you know it's something that I just kind

705
00:25:19,780 --> 00:25:22,540
of expect is a thing and that's does

706
00:25:22,540 --> 00:25:25,060
somewhat affect my willingness to enable

707
00:25:25,060 --> 00:25:27,190
2fa but I think the other thing is just

708
00:25:27,190 --> 00:25:28,240
like this is something that I've been

709
00:25:28,240 --> 00:25:30,040
working in for many years now and so

710
00:25:30,040 --> 00:25:31,780
this is something that I think about all

711
00:25:31,780 --> 00:25:33,310
the time and so I'm gonna be somebody

712
00:25:33,310 --> 00:25:34,930
that's more willing to put in the time

713
00:25:34,930 --> 00:25:36,190
investment to set up my personal

714
00:25:36,190 --> 00:25:40,510
security and a lot of people are not but

715
00:25:40,510 --> 00:25:42,640
hope is not lost awareness and adoption

716
00:25:42,640 --> 00:25:44,800
had almost doubled in the last two years

717
00:25:44,800 --> 00:25:46,870
there might be a couple of reasons for

718
00:25:46,870 --> 00:25:49,990
this for one this so in comparison here

719
00:25:49,990 --> 00:25:52,390
the the 2019 report came out at the in

720
00:25:52,390 --> 00:25:54,520
December of 2019 so I can assume that

721
00:25:54,520 --> 00:25:56,590
the research from from e17 was conducted

722
00:25:56,590 --> 00:25:59,380
towards the end of 2017 if you remember

723
00:25:59,380 --> 00:26:01,810
at the end of 2017 around December of

724
00:26:01,810 --> 00:26:03,460
that year the price of Bitcoin spiked

725
00:26:03,460 --> 00:26:05,530
then that did inspire a lot of people to

726
00:26:05,530 --> 00:26:07,870
think about additional security measures

727
00:26:07,870 --> 00:26:10,300
for their online accounts so that could

728
00:26:10,300 --> 00:26:11,350
have happened between these two

729
00:26:11,350 --> 00:26:14,080
measurements but I also think one of the

730
00:26:14,080 --> 00:26:16,360
ways that we increased awareness and

731
00:26:16,360 --> 00:26:17,860
adoption is companies are starting to

732
00:26:17,860 --> 00:26:19,390
get a little bit more savvy with how

733
00:26:19,390 --> 00:26:22,530
they're influencing people to turn it on

734
00:26:22,530 --> 00:26:24,670
because unless your coin base you

735
00:26:24,670 --> 00:26:27,880
probably won't make too FA mandatory but

736
00:26:27,880 --> 00:26:29,560
you do have other options and just

737
00:26:29,560 --> 00:26:32,320
hiding it in profile settings so you

738
00:26:32,320 --> 00:26:33,760
could do something like put it in the

739
00:26:33,760 --> 00:26:34,990
profile settings you're gonna get a

740
00:26:34,990 --> 00:26:36,640
really low number of people that turn

741
00:26:36,640 --> 00:26:37,210
that on

742
00:26:37,210 --> 00:26:38,380
they have to like navigate to the

743
00:26:38,380 --> 00:26:40,510
settings and decide to enable it you

744
00:26:40,510 --> 00:26:42,429
could prompt them at login so when

745
00:26:42,429 --> 00:26:43,809
they're looking in and say hey we notice

746
00:26:43,809 --> 00:26:45,340
you don't have to if they turned on

747
00:26:45,340 --> 00:26:47,470
would you like to set that up now and

748
00:26:47,470 --> 00:26:49,000
walk them through the flow at that time

749
00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:50,679
one of the things that I think is

750
00:26:50,679 --> 00:26:52,840
interesting is uh companies are starting

751
00:26:52,840 --> 00:26:55,360
to do some product incentives to send

752
00:26:55,360 --> 00:26:58,600
advice people to turn on to f5 so we

753
00:26:58,600 --> 00:27:00,279
know strategies like product and

754
00:27:00,279 --> 00:27:02,350
symptoms work from looking at Google's

755
00:27:02,350 --> 00:27:05,140
search trends for 2fa so if anybody

756
00:27:05,140 --> 00:27:08,110
knows what a spike from August 20 18 was

757
00:27:08,110 --> 00:27:11,110
you can put it in the comments I'm

758
00:27:11,110 --> 00:27:12,549
curious to see if anything remembers

759
00:27:12,549 --> 00:27:14,110
this you can kind of see this spike from

760
00:27:14,110 --> 00:27:16,720
Bitcoin at the end of 2017 there this

761
00:27:16,720 --> 00:27:18,669
this small one right above the 2018

762
00:27:18,669 --> 00:27:21,640
marker but in August of 2018 was when we

763
00:27:21,640 --> 00:27:23,320
started to see this really strike a

764
00:27:23,320 --> 00:27:25,510
spike in terms of Google Trends for 2fa

765
00:27:25,510 --> 00:27:28,049
searches

766
00:27:37,539 --> 00:27:40,720
all right I will break the suspense this

767
00:27:40,720 --> 00:27:42,850
was when Fortnight decided to offer

768
00:27:42,850 --> 00:27:45,489
in-game incentives for its users to turn

769
00:27:45,489 --> 00:27:48,159
on to FA and I thought this is a really

770
00:27:48,159 --> 00:27:49,509
clever thing because if you're familiar

771
00:27:49,509 --> 00:27:51,519
with fortnight at all it's like the most

772
00:27:51,519 --> 00:27:54,789
popular game on you know for gamers a

773
00:27:54,789 --> 00:27:56,669
lot of times especially for the teens

774
00:27:56,669 --> 00:27:59,440
you know at least it was at this time in

775
00:27:59,440 --> 00:28:01,809
late 2018 and so them offering

776
00:28:01,809 --> 00:28:03,789
incentives really really spiked

777
00:28:03,789 --> 00:28:06,279
awareness for a lot of people and now

778
00:28:06,279 --> 00:28:08,649
even almost two years later three of the

779
00:28:08,649 --> 00:28:11,289
top 5 related search queries to GFI have

780
00:28:11,289 --> 00:28:13,119
to do with fortnight Epic Games is the

781
00:28:13,119 --> 00:28:16,450
company that owns fortnight for tonight

782
00:28:16,450 --> 00:28:18,369
isn't the only ones that are offering

783
00:28:18,369 --> 00:28:20,619
incentives even though actually I think

784
00:28:20,619 --> 00:28:22,239
just two days ago they started offering

785
00:28:22,239 --> 00:28:24,099
another incentives it's like a time

786
00:28:24,099 --> 00:28:26,229
boxed incentive so it games was saying

787
00:28:26,229 --> 00:28:28,119
hey if you want to download any of our

788
00:28:28,119 --> 00:28:31,929
free games you have to turn on to ffs in

789
00:28:31,929 --> 00:28:33,340
order to get access to our free games

790
00:28:33,340 --> 00:28:34,539
and I thought that was a really clever

791
00:28:34,539 --> 00:28:36,849
thing they expired it sometime in May

792
00:28:36,849 --> 00:28:39,399
and that was something that is going to

793
00:28:39,399 --> 00:28:40,960
incentivize a lot of people to turn on

794
00:28:40,960 --> 00:28:42,849
that future and hopefully prevent the

795
00:28:42,849 --> 00:28:44,590
amount of account takeover we've seen a

796
00:28:44,590 --> 00:28:46,779
lot of gaming companies start to do this

797
00:28:46,779 --> 00:28:48,009
because there's a lot of fraud that

798
00:28:48,009 --> 00:28:50,289
happens within gaming companies but they

799
00:28:50,289 --> 00:28:51,729
had the only ones offering incentives

800
00:28:51,729 --> 00:28:53,619
companies like MailChimp are offering a

801
00:28:53,619 --> 00:28:55,570
10% discount for accounts that turn onto

802
00:28:55,570 --> 00:28:57,970
that bag and so even if your company

803
00:28:57,970 --> 00:28:59,499
doesn't have something like free like an

804
00:28:59,499 --> 00:29:01,419
in-game emote that you can give away to

805
00:29:01,419 --> 00:29:04,090
people you can still offer product

806
00:29:04,090 --> 00:29:05,950
discounts you can still offer discounts

807
00:29:05,950 --> 00:29:07,899
off of their next bill there's ways that

808
00:29:07,899 --> 00:29:08,830
you can start to think about

809
00:29:08,830 --> 00:29:12,070
incentivizing people unlocking features

810
00:29:12,070 --> 00:29:13,629
that might otherwise be enterprise

811
00:29:13,629 --> 00:29:15,759
features you know there's there's

812
00:29:15,759 --> 00:29:17,019
different types of incentives that you

813
00:29:17,019 --> 00:29:18,220
could do depending on what your business

814
00:29:18,220 --> 00:29:22,599
is and so let's take a look at how you

815
00:29:22,599 --> 00:29:24,669
might measure the impact of some of

816
00:29:24,669 --> 00:29:26,710
these features like everything this is

817
00:29:26,710 --> 00:29:28,509
going to depend on your business but

818
00:29:28,509 --> 00:29:29,710
here the some of the things that you

819
00:29:29,710 --> 00:29:32,409
might want to measure so you might want

820
00:29:32,409 --> 00:29:34,149
to look at mean overall losses due to

821
00:29:34,149 --> 00:29:35,619
account takeover you probably want to

822
00:29:35,619 --> 00:29:37,720
see that number go down regardless you

823
00:29:37,720 --> 00:29:39,190
might care about the total number of

824
00:29:39,190 --> 00:29:41,499
compromised accounts you also might not

825
00:29:41,499 --> 00:29:43,210
you only might want to see a high-value

826
00:29:43,210 --> 00:29:45,249
account start getting taken over because

827
00:29:45,249 --> 00:29:46,659
one of the things that you could do with

828
00:29:46,659 --> 00:29:48,609
this type of information is decide that

829
00:29:48,609 --> 00:29:50,980
hey maybe we do start to enforce

830
00:29:50,980 --> 00:29:53,320
to fa4 accounts that are worth a certain

831
00:29:53,320 --> 00:29:55,030
amount of money and worth a certain

832
00:29:55,030 --> 00:29:56,890
amount of money might be different

833
00:29:56,890 --> 00:29:58,780
depending on what your business is you

834
00:29:58,780 --> 00:30:00,640
can start to think of strata here for

835
00:30:00,640 --> 00:30:02,950
things like maybe Twitter decides that

836
00:30:02,950 --> 00:30:04,240
they're gonna force and verified

837
00:30:04,240 --> 00:30:08,320
accounts to turn on to FA maybe when it

838
00:30:08,320 --> 00:30:10,030
decides that they're going to force you

839
00:30:10,030 --> 00:30:12,280
know moderators to turn on to FA or

840
00:30:12,280 --> 00:30:14,380
stuff like that there's ways that you

841
00:30:14,380 --> 00:30:16,090
can start to think about how you enforce

842
00:30:16,090 --> 00:30:18,370
or how you incentivize to FA for

843
00:30:18,370 --> 00:30:21,040
different types of users and so even if

844
00:30:21,040 --> 00:30:23,200
lower value accounts do get compromised

845
00:30:23,200 --> 00:30:24,669
you might not care as much if those

846
00:30:24,669 --> 00:30:26,080
aren't actually costing you that much

847
00:30:26,080 --> 00:30:30,040
money you also definitely want to be

848
00:30:30,040 --> 00:30:31,960
friends with support and talk to them

849
00:30:31,960 --> 00:30:34,120
and understand how much support is

850
00:30:34,120 --> 00:30:36,610
costing you for your authentication it's

851
00:30:36,610 --> 00:30:37,980
definitely something that Enterprise

852
00:30:37,980 --> 00:30:40,330
identity teams are thinking a lot about

853
00:30:40,330 --> 00:30:42,250
on that larger company is you know you

854
00:30:42,250 --> 00:30:44,620
you want to make sure that changing your

855
00:30:44,620 --> 00:30:46,450
to factor authentication or adding

856
00:30:46,450 --> 00:30:49,179
additional friction if it does introduce

857
00:30:49,179 --> 00:30:51,340
additional support costs which it might

858
00:30:51,340 --> 00:30:54,570
and that could be okay as long as it is

859
00:30:54,570 --> 00:30:57,730
creating inside too early creating a

860
00:30:57,730 --> 00:30:59,980
benefit for the number of losses you

861
00:30:59,980 --> 00:31:00,880
want to make sure that those are going

862
00:31:00,880 --> 00:31:04,870
down relative to the support costs and

863
00:31:04,870 --> 00:31:06,160
finally I just want to leave you with

864
00:31:06,160 --> 00:31:07,809
some things you could do in the short

865
00:31:07,809 --> 00:31:11,110
term to make sure that you a short

866
00:31:11,110 --> 00:31:12,520
medium and long term to make sure that

867
00:31:12,520 --> 00:31:13,809
you're doing a great thing for your

868
00:31:13,809 --> 00:31:16,270
business and for your customers and so

869
00:31:16,270 --> 00:31:17,860
some of the things you could do this

870
00:31:17,860 --> 00:31:19,960
week is just take inventory of what

871
00:31:19,960 --> 00:31:21,730
you're already doing to protect users in

872
00:31:21,730 --> 00:31:24,100
your applications what forms the to FA

873
00:31:24,100 --> 00:31:27,100
do you offer at all any how many users

874
00:31:27,100 --> 00:31:28,690
have turned it on that's a really good

875
00:31:28,690 --> 00:31:30,580
baseline metric to have and what is

876
00:31:30,580 --> 00:31:32,410
account takeover currently costing you

877
00:31:32,410 --> 00:31:33,910
you know how are you dealing with that

878
00:31:33,910 --> 00:31:35,860
are you offering you know any kind of

879
00:31:35,860 --> 00:31:37,990
revenue forgiveness for that and how

880
00:31:37,990 --> 00:31:39,640
much are you offering is that something

881
00:31:39,640 --> 00:31:41,919
that if you started to offer incentives

882
00:31:41,919 --> 00:31:44,980
to mitigate that that you could offset

883
00:31:44,980 --> 00:31:47,230
the revenue losses things like help you

884
00:31:47,230 --> 00:31:49,600
get a baseline understanding of where

885
00:31:49,600 --> 00:31:52,330
you're at the medium term if you don't

886
00:31:52,330 --> 00:31:54,790
already offer to FA SMS is a good place

887
00:31:54,790 --> 00:31:56,740
to start with this but if you already

888
00:31:56,740 --> 00:31:58,210
offer to a PHA there's a good chance

889
00:31:58,210 --> 00:31:59,679
you're using SMS and there may be

890
00:31:59,679 --> 00:32:01,059
opportunities to make that experience

891
00:32:01,059 --> 00:32:04,350
better for your customers and then

892
00:32:04,350 --> 00:32:05,730
long-term you definitely want to start

893
00:32:05,730 --> 00:32:07,530
to think about if there's any incentives

894
00:32:07,530 --> 00:32:09,360
makes sense for your customers for your

895
00:32:09,360 --> 00:32:11,880
business and then you can start to think

896
00:32:11,880 --> 00:32:13,679
about adding more secure channels to

897
00:32:13,679 --> 00:32:15,510
really light your security compass users

898
00:32:15,510 --> 00:32:17,700
we do this definitely make sure that you

899
00:32:17,700 --> 00:32:20,669
allow users to turn off SMS as an option

900
00:32:20,669 --> 00:32:21,990
because a lot of security conscious

901
00:32:21,990 --> 00:32:24,330
users don't want to see that as a thing

902
00:32:24,330 --> 00:32:26,850
that they have access to or they want to

903
00:32:26,850 --> 00:32:28,590
make sure there's not a way to fall back

904
00:32:28,590 --> 00:32:30,929
to that if they're at risk for being

905
00:32:30,929 --> 00:32:33,360
taken over but just monitor the ongoing

906
00:32:33,360 --> 00:32:35,250
impact of your changes and make sure

907
00:32:35,250 --> 00:32:37,140
that they're having effects that you

908
00:32:37,140 --> 00:32:40,320
want to see there's definitely not one

909
00:32:40,320 --> 00:32:42,000
size fits all solution here but I like

910
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:43,440
to remind folks you just really want to

911
00:32:43,440 --> 00:32:45,360
be intentional about this consider your

912
00:32:45,360 --> 00:32:47,070
business consider your users and

913
00:32:47,070 --> 00:32:49,470
optimize accordingly for what you find

914
00:32:49,470 --> 00:32:52,200
there because like the security

915
00:32:52,200 --> 00:32:54,480
researcher Cormac Hurley says when we

916
00:32:54,480 --> 00:32:56,880
exaggerate all dangers we simply train

917
00:32:56,880 --> 00:33:00,059
users to ignore us so I hope I've given

918
00:33:00,059 --> 00:33:01,590
you some inspiration for how to think

919
00:33:01,590 --> 00:33:04,020
about your authentication systems I'm

920
00:33:04,020 --> 00:33:05,640
going to be available for any questions

921
00:33:05,640 --> 00:33:08,429
once again my name is Kelly Robinson and

922
00:33:08,429 --> 00:33:14,309
thank you for listening thanks Katie

923
00:33:14,309 --> 00:33:16,080
that was great

924
00:33:16,080 --> 00:33:18,419
Tiffany some comments in there slack on

925
00:33:18,419 --> 00:33:21,840
on people sort of using 2fa and at

926
00:33:21,840 --> 00:33:23,460
different parts of the process so I

927
00:33:23,460 --> 00:33:26,309
think definitely room to ramp up and and

928
00:33:26,309 --> 00:33:28,740
add more security to what they're doing

929
00:33:28,740 --> 00:33:30,390
I wouldn't have a lot of questions on

930
00:33:30,390 --> 00:33:32,039
the channel today probably because it

931
00:33:32,039 --> 00:33:34,770
was such a lovely well-rounded session

932
00:33:34,770 --> 00:33:36,630
but a lot of great comments and things

933
00:33:36,630 --> 00:33:38,370
like that and obviously as all the

934
00:33:38,370 --> 00:33:40,380
community members know any questions as

935
00:33:40,380 --> 00:33:42,750
they come in and you can pop them on the

936
00:33:42,750 --> 00:33:45,270
slacker on the YouTube and we get this

937
00:33:45,270 --> 00:33:47,370
across here to Kelly as well as sort of

938
00:33:47,370 --> 00:33:49,559
the other community members are there to

939
00:33:49,559 --> 00:33:51,900
to help an answer as well so thank you

940
