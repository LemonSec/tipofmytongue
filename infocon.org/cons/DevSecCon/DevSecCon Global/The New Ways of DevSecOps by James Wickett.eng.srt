knowledge and best practices in software

43
00:01:40,530 --> 00:01:43,020

said I've been working on a bit and

65
00:02:36,980 --> 00:02:38,870
we're trying to talk about devstack ops

66
00:02:38,870 --> 00:02:42,230
and and think about what does it really

67
00:02:42,230 --> 00:02:44,599
look like how does this how does this

68
00:02:44,599 --> 00:02:46,420
all fit together

69
00:02:46,420 --> 00:02:50,750
Who am I I work over at Erica I'm a dev

70
00:02:50,750 --> 00:02:53,060
advocate and doing some senior security

71
00:02:53,060 --> 00:02:54,799
and a senior security engineer over

72
00:02:54,799 --> 00:02:57,110
there I also have some courses on

73
00:02:57,110 --> 00:03:00,160
LinkedIn learning i've courses on DevOps

74
00:03:00,160 --> 00:03:02,930
DevOps like foundations a series course

75
00:03:02,930 --> 00:03:04,400
that I did with friend of minor and a

76
00:03:04,400 --> 00:03:07,430
smaller we also have some I also have a

77
00:03:07,430 --> 00:03:09,290
couple of courses on devstack ops and

78
00:03:09,290 --> 00:03:12,410
doing like a continuous integration and

79
00:03:12,410 --> 00:03:13,760
continuous delivery pipeline with

80
00:03:13,760 --> 00:03:15,890
security built into it that's available

81
00:03:15,890 --> 00:03:18,049
on LinkedIn learning I believe there's

82
00:03:18,049 --> 00:03:20,690
also if you have a subscription to

83
00:03:20,690 --> 00:03:25,100
lynda.com it's also available there okay

84
00:03:25,100 --> 00:03:27,609
and then I also I live in Austin Texas

85
00:03:27,609 --> 00:03:30,799
and I organized the DevOps Days event

86
00:03:30,799 --> 00:03:33,140
there the server list days event and we

87
00:03:33,140 --> 00:03:35,060
have a devstack ops days event in Austin

88
00:03:35,060 --> 00:03:37,400
coming soon so stay stay tuned for that

89
00:03:37,400 --> 00:03:39,440
and I'm working on the dev sac ops

90
00:03:39,440 --> 00:03:41,720
handbook it's in progress and writing a

91
00:03:41,720 --> 00:03:42,890
book is hard so I've been learning

92
00:03:42,890 --> 00:03:46,700
learning that lesson alright one of the

93
00:03:46,700 --> 00:03:48,620
things that I'm also specialize in is

94
00:03:48,620 --> 00:03:50,480
half listening to conference talks and

95
00:03:50,480 --> 00:03:53,030
and this is about the quality of the

96
00:03:53,030 --> 00:03:54,019
memes that are going to be in the

97
00:03:54,019 --> 00:03:55,609
presentation so I hope that doesn't

98
00:03:55,609 --> 00:03:58,760
disappoint anybody but because of that

99
00:03:58,760 --> 00:04:01,850

107
00:04:18,589 --> 00:04:19,850

things like this is the best edition of

111
00:04:25,340 --> 00:04:26,690
the secure developer I've ever seen or

112

113
00:04:27,870 --> 00:04:30,540

okay so just one I'm going to do one

120
00:04:41,430 --> 00:04:45,240
slide on what merica is where whereas

121
00:04:45,240 --> 00:04:47,160
we're an enterprise platform and we're

122
00:04:47,160 --> 00:04:49,199
doing continuous verification we're

123
00:04:49,199 --> 00:04:50,639
using a lot of the principles from chaos

124
00:04:50,639 --> 00:04:52,320
engineering to take a proactive and

125
00:04:52,320 --> 00:04:53,460
measured approach to preventing

126
00:04:53,460 --> 00:04:55,770
availability and security incidents it's

127
00:04:55,770 --> 00:04:57,120
really excited about that

128
00:04:57,120 --> 00:04:59,940
we're kind of a newish company but we're

129
00:04:59,940 --> 00:05:03,419
growing ok let's start out with dev sec

130
00:05:03,419 --> 00:05:05,430
ops tech ops what does it mean what is

131
00:05:05,430 --> 00:05:07,470
it why do we need this term do we just

132
00:05:07,470 --> 00:05:08,970
have DevOps can we just be happy with

133
00:05:08,970 --> 00:05:12,030
that I thought we could just sort of go

134
00:05:12,030 --> 00:05:14,940
to a little bit of Jack Handey here and

135
00:05:14,940 --> 00:05:19,080
question what is DevOps and so if you're

136
00:05:19,080 --> 00:05:21,930
not familiar with Jack Handey or deep

137
00:05:21,930 --> 00:05:23,639
thoughts then maybe this is gonna be

138
00:05:23,639 --> 00:05:26,300
weird but we're gonna give it a try

139
00:05:26,300 --> 00:05:28,860
maybe in order to understand dev sack

140
00:05:28,860 --> 00:05:31,460
ops we have to look at the word itself

141
00:05:31,460 --> 00:05:33,720
basically it's made up of three separate

142
00:05:33,720 --> 00:05:40,740
words de Vie Seco and what do these

143
00:05:40,740 --> 00:05:42,810
words mean it's a mystery

144
00:05:42,810 --> 00:05:45,150
and that's why so is Deb said devstack

145
00:05:45,150 --> 00:05:48,260
ops all right good friend Josh Zimmerman

146
00:05:48,260 --> 00:05:50,340
kind of came up with the original DevOps

147
00:05:50,340 --> 00:05:51,780
Jack Handey so this is a parody of a

148
00:05:51,780 --> 00:05:53,820
parody so that's that that's the best we

149
00:05:53,820 --> 00:05:55,710
have right here but no deficit cops

150
00:05:55,710 --> 00:05:57,180
really what what are we what are we

151
00:05:57,180 --> 00:05:59,729
saying here why does it exist why do we

152
00:05:59,729 --> 00:06:02,880
need it what you know why did this kind

153
00:06:02,880 --> 00:06:05,039
of come in our and kind of in our world

154
00:06:05,039 --> 00:06:07,440
and I think first before we go down that

155
00:06:07,440 --> 00:06:10,080
question question in this path like we

156
00:06:10,080 --> 00:06:11,910
need to understand DevOps and like how

157
00:06:11,910 --> 00:06:13,950
we got here so this is gonna be a real

158
00:06:13,950 --> 00:06:15,570
special time where we kind of overview

159
00:06:15,570 --> 00:06:17,940
technology over the last couple decades

160
00:06:17,940 --> 00:06:21,330
and we can think about oh how we were

161
00:06:21,330 --> 00:06:23,880
brought here from the cloud and we had

162
00:06:23,880 --> 00:06:27,240
all this data and that sort of moved

163
00:06:27,240 --> 00:06:31,050
everywhere and oh the new OSI model is a

164
00:06:31,050 --> 00:06:33,510
lot better for me I don't know about for

165
00:06:33,510 --> 00:06:34,830
y'all but I was always confused about

166
00:06:34,830 --> 00:06:37,130
where the layers are but this is now

167
00:06:37,130 --> 00:06:40,650
software all the way down which is great

168
00:06:40,650 --> 00:06:42,990
but in seriousness as we move out of

169
00:06:42,990 --> 00:06:45,420
hardware to vm's to kind of even service

170
00:06:45,420 --> 00:06:48,750
models where we're helping to kind of

171
00:06:48,750 --> 00:06:51,960
have IT move out of the of using

172
00:06:51,960 --> 00:06:53,610
everything for like waste and value like

173
00:06:53,610 --> 00:06:55,680
in one giant expense but sort of

174
00:06:55,680 --> 00:06:57,210
breaking that up and we saw that the

175
00:06:57,210 --> 00:06:59,550
move to VMs like smaller chunks and now

176
00:06:59,550 --> 00:07:01,020
we're seeing we're paying for just what

177
00:07:01,020 --> 00:07:02,520
we use we're able to like provide

178
00:07:02,520 --> 00:07:04,410
through like these opinionated type

179
00:07:04,410 --> 00:07:07,410
frameworks were able to actually you

180
00:07:07,410 --> 00:07:09,240
know see unlock value that that's hidden

181
00:07:09,240 --> 00:07:12,270
inside of our systems and as we've grown

182
00:07:12,270 --> 00:07:14,880
like we've it is kind of the movement

183
00:07:14,880 --> 00:07:16,470
has been out of like from our data

184
00:07:16,470 --> 00:07:20,310
centers into these server lists or cloud

185
00:07:20,310 --> 00:07:22,890
native or whatever prop you know setups

186
00:07:22,890 --> 00:07:24,540
like we sort of believe that we have

187
00:07:24,540 --> 00:07:26,280
this idea that oh great we get you know

188
00:07:26,280 --> 00:07:28,980
ops and security you know just for free

189
00:07:28,980 --> 00:07:33,000
right and and I think there's there's a

190
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:34,950
there's a reason we've thought that

191
00:07:34,950 --> 00:07:37,080
because we we sort of grew hand-in-hand

192
00:07:37,080 --> 00:07:39,600
at the cloud we sort of saw the how ops

193
00:07:39,600 --> 00:07:42,750
has changed over time and there was a

194
00:07:42,750 --> 00:07:44,850
view where people believe that DevOps

195
00:07:44,850 --> 00:07:47,280
was this inevitable force of things that

196
00:07:47,280 --> 00:07:50,040
had to happen you couldn't you can't

197
00:07:50,040 --> 00:07:54,030
manage you know tens of servers tens and

198
00:07:54,030 --> 00:07:55,560
tens and hundreds of servers as a

199
00:07:55,560 --> 00:07:57,320
certain as a person you could do that

200
00:07:57,320 --> 00:07:59,580
but once you like have to scale to like

201
00:07:59,580 --> 00:08:01,800
thousands of servers that was a that was

202
00:08:01,800 --> 00:08:03,960
something that makes it impossible to do

203
00:08:03,960 --> 00:08:06,030
and so DevOps needed to come aright

204
00:08:06,030 --> 00:08:09,060
around so Tom Lehman Shelley he has a

205
00:08:09,060 --> 00:08:10,950
great a great quote on this he says

206
00:08:10,950 --> 00:08:12,840
DevOps is an inevitable result of

207
00:08:12,840 --> 00:08:15,600
needing to do efficient operations in a

208
00:08:15,600 --> 00:08:17,550
distributed computing and cloud

209
00:08:17,550 --> 00:08:22,860
environment and I like that and I'm not

210
00:08:22,860 --> 00:08:24,990
against that view I don't think that's

211
00:08:24,990 --> 00:08:27,360
wrong but I also see that DevOps was

212
00:08:27,360 --> 00:08:28,680
more of a breakthrough than

213
00:08:28,680 --> 00:08:30,210
epistemological breakthrough where

214
00:08:30,210 --> 00:08:33,000
you're able to join separate people to

215
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:35,220
understand and know you know a problem

216
00:08:35,220 --> 00:08:37,620
in a more in a more deep way I mean the

217
00:08:37,620 --> 00:08:39,390
extension of agile is another way that

218
00:08:39,390 --> 00:08:42,570
people talk about it but it is a move

219
00:08:42,570 --> 00:08:47,070
where DevOps is able to fix this this

220
00:08:47,070 --> 00:08:48,690
distribution of labor that's just not a

221
00:08:48,690 --> 00:08:52,810
fair or equitable type of thing

222
00:08:52,810 --> 00:08:54,759
we you know you can even go in the early

223
00:08:54,759 --> 00:08:56,350
days of DevOps literature it's like

224
00:08:56,350 --> 00:08:58,420
Furby 10 developers we would have one

225
00:08:58,420 --> 00:09:02,350
operation staff and and Damon Edwards

226
00:09:02,350 --> 00:09:03,759
has this great quote he says it's not a

227
00:09:03,759 --> 00:09:05,649
technical problem but DevOps is a

228
00:09:05,649 --> 00:09:07,930
business problem we're trying to you

229
00:09:07,930 --> 00:09:11,290
know a line around the goals of you know

230
00:09:11,290 --> 00:09:14,339
of a being able to deliver software and

231
00:09:14,339 --> 00:09:16,990
you know I think we could even easily

232
00:09:16,990 --> 00:09:18,879
make this point that DevOps is just

233
00:09:18,879 --> 00:09:20,499
another way point on a JAL's journey

234
00:09:20,499 --> 00:09:22,059
across the business I think that's a

235
00:09:22,059 --> 00:09:23,589
helpful way to think about like agile

236
00:09:23,589 --> 00:09:25,959
really transform the way we build

237
00:09:25,959 --> 00:09:29,050
software you know 20 years ago and then

238
00:09:29,050 --> 00:09:30,939
operations said oh hey there's this

239
00:09:30,939 --> 00:09:32,259
thing like you know in version control

240
00:09:32,259 --> 00:09:34,269
my code and and like treat

241
00:09:34,269 --> 00:09:37,269
infrastructure is code and start start

242
00:09:37,269 --> 00:09:40,680
moving into like this more it's more

243
00:09:40,680 --> 00:09:43,959
agile approach and so and even early

244
00:09:43,959 --> 00:09:45,389
days DevOps was called like agile

245
00:09:45,389 --> 00:09:49,569
operations right and I think this is

246
00:09:49,569 --> 00:09:51,370
this is another review point and there's

247
00:09:51,370 --> 00:09:53,379
a good quote on this but it's DevOps is

248
00:09:53,379 --> 00:09:55,180
the application it is the application of

249
00:09:55,180 --> 00:09:56,620
agile methodology to system

250
00:09:56,620 --> 00:09:58,500
administration

251
00:09:58,500 --> 00:10:02,709
okay so DevOps that's fine I mean that

252
00:10:02,709 --> 00:10:04,600
that's we've we've had it for a long

253
00:10:04,600 --> 00:10:06,730
enough time but why are we why are we

254
00:10:06,730 --> 00:10:08,829
now you know kind of extending this to

255
00:10:08,829 --> 00:10:12,069
Deb sack ops and I've asked myself the

256
00:10:12,069 --> 00:10:12,850
same question

257
00:10:12,850 --> 00:10:15,610
you know like should we just dev QA SEC

258
00:10:15,610 --> 00:10:18,490
data guff in more ops like I don't know

259
00:10:18,490 --> 00:10:22,509
I don't know but I do think that if you

260
00:10:22,509 --> 00:10:24,790
expand your your empathy here you see

261
00:10:24,790 --> 00:10:26,500
that security finds itself in the same

262
00:10:26,500 --> 00:10:29,589
position the operations did really at

263
00:10:29,589 --> 00:10:31,779
the start at the the genesis of the

264
00:10:31,779 --> 00:10:34,269
movement of DevOps they find themselves

265
00:10:34,269 --> 00:10:37,000
where they're dealing with 100

266
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:39,519
developers to ten operations people to

267
00:10:39,519 --> 00:10:42,579
like one security people sometimes it's

268
00:10:42,579 --> 00:10:45,459
a hundred to half two hundred to one you

269
00:10:45,459 --> 00:10:48,689
know these these are numbers that are

270
00:10:48,689 --> 00:10:51,279
intractable they're it's an equitable

271
00:10:51,279 --> 00:10:53,920
for people to work in this way you know

272
00:10:53,920 --> 00:10:56,980
you it's a natural way to build silos

273
00:10:56,980 --> 00:10:59,499
and so we see security often put into

274
00:10:59,499 --> 00:11:01,329
this like side silo and most

275
00:11:01,329 --> 00:11:03,508
organizations

276
00:11:04,100 --> 00:11:07,360
and and this like operations did

277
00:11:07,360 --> 00:11:10,639
security really struggles to find a way

278
00:11:10,639 --> 00:11:12,980
to provide some sort of value in many

279
00:11:12,980 --> 00:11:15,980
organizations now this is not just like

280
00:11:15,980 --> 00:11:17,839
an outside view coming in this is

281
00:11:17,839 --> 00:11:20,149
something that even the security experts

282
00:11:20,149 --> 00:11:23,959
in the kind of the people that are you

283
00:11:23,959 --> 00:11:25,399
know the head of the industry really

284
00:11:25,399 --> 00:11:26,560
believe this as well

285
00:11:26,560 --> 00:11:29,810
Steve below even wrote this and in this

286
00:11:29,810 --> 00:11:32,569
he is he is the guy who wrote the book

287
00:11:32,569 --> 00:11:36,139
on firewalls in the 90s and then

288
00:11:36,139 --> 00:11:38,120
recently he wrote this book called

289
00:11:38,120 --> 00:11:41,389
thinking security and in it he sort of

290
00:11:41,389 --> 00:11:43,670
mines in the opening he's like you know

291
00:11:43,670 --> 00:11:45,380
companies are spending a great deal on

292
00:11:45,380 --> 00:11:48,529
security but we read a massive computer

293
00:11:48,529 --> 00:11:52,339
related attacks clearly something is

294
00:11:52,339 --> 00:11:55,279
wrong the root of the problem is twofold

295
00:11:55,279 --> 00:11:57,319
for protecting the wrong things and

296
00:11:57,319 --> 00:11:59,420
we're hurting productivity in the

297
00:11:59,420 --> 00:12:02,509
process and when you hear that think

298
00:12:02,509 --> 00:12:05,449
about those two main problems like it's

299
00:12:05,449 --> 00:12:08,630
not like we're protecting the right

300
00:12:08,630 --> 00:12:10,639
things because if we were the breaches

301
00:12:10,639 --> 00:12:12,350
would like slow down but they seem to

302
00:12:12,350 --> 00:12:13,910
just get it be getting bigger more

303
00:12:13,910 --> 00:12:17,120
frequent and the other problem is which

304
00:12:17,120 --> 00:12:18,860
in that meant that could be forgivable

305
00:12:18,860 --> 00:12:20,660
if like things were getting better

306
00:12:20,660 --> 00:12:22,880
security wise like we were having less

307
00:12:22,880 --> 00:12:26,480
breaches but along with that so we're

308
00:12:26,480 --> 00:12:28,040
not putting the right defense in place

309
00:12:28,040 --> 00:12:29,449
and we're not getting we're not actually

310
00:12:29,449 --> 00:12:31,880
adding protection we're hurting

311
00:12:31,880 --> 00:12:33,949
productivity like developers are having

312
00:12:33,949 --> 00:12:37,490
to slow down I could find quotes all

313
00:12:37,490 --> 00:12:39,800
over the place where people sign up to

314
00:12:39,800 --> 00:12:41,420
like hey this project like didn't hit

315
00:12:41,420 --> 00:12:42,560
because we had to meet all these

316
00:12:42,560 --> 00:12:44,630
security controls and regulations in

317
00:12:44,630 --> 00:12:46,250
this outside and you know coming in

318
00:12:46,250 --> 00:12:49,040
forces for that that have changed it and

319
00:12:49,040 --> 00:12:52,459
that's that's made security sort of this

320
00:12:52,459 --> 00:12:54,319
hated part of the business because

321
00:12:54,319 --> 00:12:56,620
they're sort of related with like

322
00:12:56,620 --> 00:12:59,060
regulations governance controls and and

323
00:12:59,060 --> 00:13:01,759
kind of this outside enforcement that is

324
00:13:01,759 --> 00:13:06,740
actually not that effective this is

325
00:13:06,740 --> 00:13:08,209
another quote that is always resonated

326
00:13:08,209 --> 00:13:10,339
with me and I included in almost every

327
00:13:10,339 --> 00:13:13,790
talk that I give because I find it to be

328
00:13:13,790 --> 00:13:16,050
it was one of the things that originally

329
00:13:16,050 --> 00:13:19,620
with me on on how we need to think about

330
00:13:19,620 --> 00:13:22,620
security as it as a different as a

331
00:13:22,620 --> 00:13:24,870
different aspect for the way that the

332
00:13:24,870 --> 00:13:27,240
most of the engineering most of industry

333
00:13:27,240 --> 00:13:30,510
views it in this book Michael Zalewski

334
00:13:30,510 --> 00:13:32,459
in the tangled web in the opening

335
00:13:32,459 --> 00:13:34,399
chapter this is a book about modern

336
00:13:34,399 --> 00:13:37,860
security and web applications right but

337
00:13:37,860 --> 00:13:40,110
in the opening chapter he he sort of

338
00:13:40,110 --> 00:13:43,350
tracks over the last five or six decades

339
00:13:43,350 --> 00:13:46,649
in like three to five-year chunks what

340
00:13:46,649 --> 00:13:49,019
security was doing all the way from like

341
00:13:49,019 --> 00:13:51,060
the 60s and the 70s from doing crypto

342
00:13:51,060 --> 00:13:53,220
and then he gets to like this kind of

343
00:13:53,220 --> 00:13:56,760
fuzzy phase in the 90s and in the 90s we

344
00:13:56,760 --> 00:13:58,950
sort of kind of moved to this risk model

345
00:13:58,950 --> 00:14:01,140
and and here's a quote that he says is a

346
00:14:01,140 --> 00:14:03,329
security by risk assessment introduces a

347
00:14:03,329 --> 00:14:05,640
real dangerous fallacy that structured

348
00:14:05,640 --> 00:14:08,269
adequate that structured inadequacy is

349
00:14:08,269 --> 00:14:11,519
almost as good as adequacy and then

350
00:14:11,519 --> 00:14:14,100
underfunded security efforts plus just

351
00:14:14,100 --> 00:14:16,320
some risk management are about as good

352
00:14:16,320 --> 00:14:19,800
as properly funded security work and in

353
00:14:19,800 --> 00:14:21,510
this talk he's sort of or in this book

354
00:14:21,510 --> 00:14:24,120
he he catalogs like there's this move

355
00:14:24,120 --> 00:14:28,110
out of out of doing engineering in those

356
00:14:28,110 --> 00:14:30,329
early days to okay let's just buy

357
00:14:30,329 --> 00:14:32,610
insurance policies put actuarial you

358
00:14:32,610 --> 00:14:37,410
know actuarial duties on top of this you

359
00:14:37,410 --> 00:14:38,970
know accept the risk that kind of stuff

360
00:14:38,970 --> 00:14:42,630
so this is a super interesting to me and

361
00:14:42,630 --> 00:14:43,950
it really struck struck home with me

362
00:14:43,950 --> 00:14:47,010
well even just as recently as late last

363
00:14:47,010 --> 00:14:49,440
year at the end of the end of 2018 all

364
00:14:49,440 --> 00:14:50,970
engineering teams are busy deploying

365
00:14:50,970 --> 00:14:53,070
leading-edge technologies security teams

366
00:14:53,070 --> 00:14:54,360
are still focused on fighting

367
00:14:54,360 --> 00:14:57,029
yesterday's battles says the deficit

368
00:14:57,029 --> 00:15:00,209
cops survey from sans and they also

369
00:15:00,209 --> 00:15:02,279
found in that same survey the 95 percent

370
00:15:02,279 --> 00:15:03,690
of security professionals spend their

371
00:15:03,690 --> 00:15:07,500
time protecting legacy applications so

372
00:15:07,500 --> 00:15:10,110
this is a this is a problem because now

373
00:15:10,110 --> 00:15:13,170
we're dealing with with this kind of

374
00:15:13,170 --> 00:15:14,820
burden and we've transferred a lot of

375
00:15:14,820 --> 00:15:17,820
the tech burden to other groups and now

376
00:15:17,820 --> 00:15:21,060
we think like oh maybe we can just as we

377
00:15:21,060 --> 00:15:23,820
move to like cloud type workloads that

378
00:15:23,820 --> 00:15:25,740
we can offload that to to other places

379
00:15:25,740 --> 00:15:27,870
and this is the same as security

380
00:15:27,870 --> 00:15:29,550
security burnin is

381
00:15:29,550 --> 00:15:31,019
not created or destroyed is merely

382
00:15:31,019 --> 00:15:33,269
transferred and so that's how 95% of

383
00:15:33,269 --> 00:15:35,370
people end up getting getting stuck with

384
00:15:35,370 --> 00:15:38,640
that with all that work and also I think

385
00:15:38,640 --> 00:15:40,709
this is a this is a helpful way to think

386
00:15:40,709 --> 00:15:42,510
about it to security I believe is in

387
00:15:42,510 --> 00:15:45,330
crisis because many security teams work

388
00:15:45,330 --> 00:15:46,769
with a worldview where their goal is to

389
00:15:46,769 --> 00:15:48,630
inhibit change as much as possible so

390
00:15:48,630 --> 00:15:51,180
they and this is a direct quote out of

391
00:15:51,180 --> 00:15:55,610
the agile application security book so I

392
00:15:55,610 --> 00:15:58,649
believe that the new technology that

393
00:15:58,649 --> 00:16:00,899
we've we've kind of grown into from

394
00:16:00,899 --> 00:16:03,269
cloud to urban Eddie's to server lists

395
00:16:03,269 --> 00:16:05,459
and our increased organizational focused

396
00:16:05,459 --> 00:16:07,709
on software delivery is why we need

397
00:16:07,709 --> 00:16:09,570
something new and that something new is

398
00:16:09,570 --> 00:16:15,000
dead-set ops and so I have a idea that

399
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:17,700
we can have this this some traits that

400
00:16:17,700 --> 00:16:20,540
we could look for in a new breed of a

401
00:16:20,540 --> 00:16:24,260
type of person the devstack OP and so

402
00:16:24,260 --> 00:16:27,120
the deficit gap is not a tool it's not a

403
00:16:27,120 --> 00:16:29,850
CIC the pipeline with security in it you

404
00:16:29,850 --> 00:16:33,360
can't buy it on the RSA expo floor this

405
00:16:33,360 --> 00:16:35,610
is this is an inclusive person that's

406
00:16:35,610 --> 00:16:37,410
participating in the movement of putting

407
00:16:37,410 --> 00:16:39,990
security into DevOps and the placement

408
00:16:39,990 --> 00:16:41,850
of security there it is like right in

409
00:16:41,850 --> 00:16:44,820
the middle like taking part of of dev

410
00:16:44,820 --> 00:16:46,680
and ops and kind of participating on

411
00:16:46,680 --> 00:16:48,810
both sides so to do this I have this

412
00:16:48,810 --> 00:16:50,940
devstack ops framework that I'd like to

413
00:16:50,940 --> 00:16:54,240
talk us through and it's stand the

414
00:16:54,240 --> 00:16:56,010
framework is the measure framework and

415
00:16:56,010 --> 00:16:57,630
we'll kind of go through each of these

416
00:16:57,630 --> 00:17:00,870
each of these piece by piece but it's a

417
00:17:00,870 --> 00:17:03,149
little bit of my cross to care so the

418
00:17:03,149 --> 00:17:05,880
the measure dips devstack ops is its

419
00:17:05,880 --> 00:17:08,959
maker driven it's built on experimenting

420
00:17:08,959 --> 00:17:11,250
nope there's the amount of auditing

421
00:17:11,250 --> 00:17:15,750
automating its safety aware hundra

422
00:17:15,750 --> 00:17:17,849
strange sharing participates in

423
00:17:17,849 --> 00:17:20,579
recognizing and and resilience type

424
00:17:20,579 --> 00:17:26,730
engineering and does empathy all right

425
00:17:26,730 --> 00:17:31,910
well let's get into em maker driven

426
00:17:32,540 --> 00:17:35,120
so I think security needs to understand

427
00:17:35,120 --> 00:17:36,800
first that there were software engineers

428
00:17:36,800 --> 00:17:37,940
and we specialize in a specific

429
00:17:37,940 --> 00:17:40,670
discipline and it's not the other way

430
00:17:40,670 --> 00:17:42,320
around we're not security first for

431
00:17:42,320 --> 00:17:44,780
software engineers first and you know a

432
00:17:44,780 --> 00:17:46,940
real hot take on this is it security

433
00:17:46,940 --> 00:17:49,370
must be able to write code I didn't

434
00:17:49,370 --> 00:17:51,620
think this is a hot take until I put it

435
00:17:51,620 --> 00:17:54,320
up at a conference a couple months ago

436
00:17:54,320 --> 00:17:55,520
and then I got a bunch of Twitter hate

437
00:17:55,520 --> 00:17:57,500
from a bunch of security people that I

438
00:17:57,500 --> 00:17:59,720
don't want to write code but I'm not

439
00:17:59,720 --> 00:18:00,860
gonna back down off it because I do

440
00:18:00,860 --> 00:18:04,760
believe that it's true and and I I think

441
00:18:04,760 --> 00:18:08,150
that this is this is it's really helpful

442
00:18:08,150 --> 00:18:09,560
right but there aren't a lot of

443
00:18:09,560 --> 00:18:11,900
resources today for people that want to

444
00:18:11,900 --> 00:18:14,510
learn how to code and so it's not that

445
00:18:14,510 --> 00:18:16,940
hard and I sort of put these in here

446
00:18:16,940 --> 00:18:22,820
humorously but let's let's uh let's face

447
00:18:22,820 --> 00:18:24,740
it I mean there's a lot of opportunity

448
00:18:24,740 --> 00:18:26,300
with all the frameworks that are going

449
00:18:26,300 --> 00:18:29,420
on that with all the frameworks

450
00:18:29,420 --> 00:18:32,660
available to us it's really possible to

451
00:18:32,660 --> 00:18:34,790
to participate in the software

452
00:18:34,790 --> 00:18:37,550
development lifecycle not we're not I'm

453
00:18:37,550 --> 00:18:39,410
not saying security needs to lead it I'm

454
00:18:39,410 --> 00:18:42,440
not saying this security needs to be you

455
00:18:42,440 --> 00:18:44,030
know in charge of it but participating

456
00:18:44,030 --> 00:18:45,830
in in the process of software delivery

457
00:18:45,830 --> 00:18:49,040
hundred percent yeah and so I believe

458
00:18:49,040 --> 00:18:50,810
this is part of adopting them to maker

459
00:18:50,810 --> 00:18:54,590
mindset and so we already see you know

460
00:18:54,590 --> 00:18:56,240
security is already using it's supposed

461
00:18:56,240 --> 00:18:59,120
to say you know programming languages in

462
00:18:59,120 --> 00:19:01,130
a lot of senses it's already using use a

463
00:19:01,130 --> 00:19:03,320
lot of dsls you know we're already

464
00:19:03,320 --> 00:19:05,390
acting like regex together to try to you

465
00:19:05,390 --> 00:19:07,850
know put in our security tooling to work

466
00:19:07,850 --> 00:19:11,480
an ops face the same problem like you

467
00:19:11,480 --> 00:19:12,380
know if you everyone

468
00:19:12,380 --> 00:19:14,750
ten ten years ago I guess maybe even a

469
00:19:14,750 --> 00:19:16,520
little bit more it's like you know

470
00:19:16,520 --> 00:19:18,890
Apache configs and engine X configs and

471
00:19:18,890 --> 00:19:20,900
and how all that stuff's like you know

472
00:19:20,900 --> 00:19:23,300
structured and pasted together in a

473
00:19:23,300 --> 00:19:25,700
sense like that's a DSL like sure it

474
00:19:25,700 --> 00:19:27,770
needed like some extra help to like to

475
00:19:27,770 --> 00:19:30,260
make it you know better but like then we

476
00:19:30,260 --> 00:19:32,480
had the arise like the config management

477
00:19:32,480 --> 00:19:34,730
and the infrastructure is code type tech

478
00:19:34,730 --> 00:19:37,190
tools but we already see this with

479
00:19:37,190 --> 00:19:37,760
security

480
00:19:37,760 --> 00:19:39,800
I've already seen people at very large

481
00:19:39,800 --> 00:19:41,630
companies like Shannon leads over to

482
00:19:41,630 --> 00:19:42,050
intuit

483
00:19:42,050 --> 00:19:42,860
or Aaron

484
00:19:42,860 --> 00:19:44,120
whenever he was over at United

485
00:19:44,120 --> 00:19:46,610
Healthcare Group you know say hey the

486
00:19:46,610 --> 00:19:48,620
entire security team must learn how to

487
00:19:48,620 --> 00:19:50,840
write code and and that is a very valid

488
00:19:50,840 --> 00:19:53,150
it is a very valid view and it was

489
00:19:53,150 --> 00:19:56,179
something that like some of the people

490
00:19:56,179 --> 00:19:57,920
on their team struggled with it

491
00:19:57,920 --> 00:19:59,900
but like over time they all they all

492
00:19:59,900 --> 00:20:02,570
groove into it pick stuff up we're able

493
00:20:02,570 --> 00:20:05,990
to contribute and it actually the very

494
00:20:05,990 --> 00:20:08,809
last point of this um this whole

495
00:20:08,809 --> 00:20:11,030
presentation is the e the empathy but

496
00:20:11,030 --> 00:20:12,980
like this is actually critical to like

497
00:20:12,980 --> 00:20:14,420
getting the empathy right because you're

498
00:20:14,420 --> 00:20:16,429
able to have security understand the

499
00:20:16,429 --> 00:20:18,350
pain that they place you know for

500
00:20:18,350 --> 00:20:21,140
developers like that is that is a very

501
00:20:21,140 --> 00:20:23,059
it is a very real thing when they put

502
00:20:23,059 --> 00:20:24,590
more roadblocks in place and they see oh

503
00:20:24,590 --> 00:20:26,390
like all these security controls and

504
00:20:26,390 --> 00:20:28,970
things they're they're you know

505
00:20:28,970 --> 00:20:31,130
hindering productivity and so like they

506
00:20:31,130 --> 00:20:33,110
need a need to live and feel that pain

507
00:20:33,110 --> 00:20:36,740
that developers feel it's like I said

508
00:20:36,740 --> 00:20:38,059
that why is this important gives them

509
00:20:38,059 --> 00:20:40,250
empathy building familiar edit the tools

510
00:20:40,250 --> 00:20:43,340
and able to move up the pipeline another

511
00:20:43,340 --> 00:20:45,320
one is that a bug is a bug is a bug and

512
00:20:45,320 --> 00:20:49,419
and you know I think that we can look at

513
00:20:49,419 --> 00:20:52,340
or we can go back to any defect density

514
00:20:52,340 --> 00:20:55,400
study over the last 20-30 years and you

515
00:20:55,400 --> 00:20:57,320
can find numbers that range from like

516
00:20:57,320 --> 00:21:01,130
half per you know like hat one one to

517
00:21:01,130 --> 00:21:03,460
half defects per thousand lines of code

518
00:21:03,460 --> 00:21:06,530
to ten defects per thousand lines of

519
00:21:06,530 --> 00:21:10,400
code and so the key here is defect

520
00:21:10,400 --> 00:21:12,770
density is never zero so we're never

521
00:21:12,770 --> 00:21:16,340
gonna live in this world where you know

522
00:21:16,340 --> 00:21:18,140
humans writing code aren't going to make

523
00:21:18,140 --> 00:21:20,780
any mistakes and when we think a bug is

524
00:21:20,780 --> 00:21:24,710
a bug is a bug you know security

525
00:21:24,710 --> 00:21:26,660
vulnerabilities are just bugs that

526
00:21:26,660 --> 00:21:29,690
actually could be exploited so this

527
00:21:29,690 --> 00:21:32,690
would be a very familiar type of slides

528
00:21:32,690 --> 00:21:34,100
here for sneaky because I borrowed this

529
00:21:34,100 --> 00:21:36,770
example from sneaked but my application

530
00:21:36,770 --> 00:21:39,169
is just a few lines of code so you might

531
00:21:39,169 --> 00:21:43,790
think but Simon was Simon had this in a

532
00:21:43,790 --> 00:21:45,380
presentation we were doing together and

533
00:21:45,380 --> 00:21:49,280
I was like oh this is great so 222 lines

534
00:21:49,280 --> 00:21:51,770
of code five direct dependencies 54

535
00:21:51,770 --> 00:21:53,240
total dependencies I probably don't have

536
00:21:53,240 --> 00:21:55,940
to tell this audience but that resulted

537
00:21:55,940 --> 00:21:56,539
in over

538
00:21:56,539 --> 00:21:58,129
four hundred and fifty thousand lines of

539
00:21:58,129 --> 00:22:03,019
code so you kind of get stuck in this

540
00:22:03,019 --> 00:22:05,509
this life cycle where you have to think

541
00:22:05,509 --> 00:22:06,889
about all these things upstream and

542
00:22:06,889 --> 00:22:08,179
that's where our products like sneak are

543
00:22:08,179 --> 00:22:12,679
really helpful the the so in the next

544
00:22:12,679 --> 00:22:16,190
piece is how wills does how well do we

545
00:22:16,190 --> 00:22:18,699
control all of our our third-party

546
00:22:18,699 --> 00:22:20,929
third-party and open source components

547
00:22:20,929 --> 00:22:22,639
libraries and binaries now this is from

548
00:22:22,639 --> 00:22:26,779
the dev sec ops 2019 survey and you

549
00:22:26,779 --> 00:22:29,329
notice that like the the DevOps practice

550
00:22:29,329 --> 00:22:32,209
the DevOps elite or the blue the node

551
00:22:32,209 --> 00:22:34,749
DevOps practice is kind of this orange e

552
00:22:34,749 --> 00:22:39,559
color so I mean it's not like the people

553
00:22:39,559 --> 00:22:42,259
that are very DevOps elite like are that

554
00:22:42,259 --> 00:22:45,379
much better across the board I mean here

555
00:22:45,379 --> 00:22:47,690
it says 117 percent but notice it's

556
00:22:47,690 --> 00:22:50,869
still like roughly 2/3 no standards to

557
00:22:50,869 --> 00:22:53,419
just you know mediocre standards so

558
00:22:53,419 --> 00:22:54,979
there's some definitely some room for

559
00:22:54,979 --> 00:22:58,669
growth here all right I think this is I

560
00:22:58,669 --> 00:23:00,349
thought it would be a more of a hot take

561
00:23:00,349 --> 00:23:02,419
whenever I've given a version of this

562
00:23:02,419 --> 00:23:05,089
presentation before is I believe that

563
00:23:05,089 --> 00:23:06,589
you cannot train developers to write

564
00:23:06,589 --> 00:23:08,779
secure code and I feel like that that

565
00:23:08,779 --> 00:23:10,249
that's just like saying like hey write

566
00:23:10,249 --> 00:23:13,539
code that has no bugs in it

567
00:23:14,779 --> 00:23:18,019
okay so instead we need to focus on the

568
00:23:18,019 --> 00:23:20,899
methods that developers use so they're

569
00:23:20,899 --> 00:23:22,549
using test-driven development behavior

570
00:23:22,549 --> 00:23:24,079
driven development

571
00:23:24,079 --> 00:23:27,049
acceptance test-driven development they

572
00:23:27,049 --> 00:23:31,509
deal with things like you like you

573
00:23:31,509 --> 00:23:33,469
looking at your code and like trying to

574
00:23:33,469 --> 00:23:35,059
figure out code smells or doing

575
00:23:35,059 --> 00:23:38,149
refactoring pretty instrumentation in

576
00:23:38,149 --> 00:23:41,359
place to identify like problems so these

577
00:23:41,359 --> 00:23:44,329
are actually better for us I think you

578
00:23:44,329 --> 00:23:46,459
know doing pairing I think is a good way

579
00:23:46,459 --> 00:23:48,319
to help kind of eliminate some of these

580
00:23:48,319 --> 00:23:50,479
problems the agile applications security

581
00:23:50,479 --> 00:23:52,219
book talks about this and they say the

582
00:23:52,219 --> 00:23:53,299
goal is to come up with a set of

583
00:23:53,299 --> 00:23:55,309
automated tests that probe and check for

584
00:23:55,309 --> 00:23:58,039
security configurations at runtime and

585
00:23:58,039 --> 00:24:01,609
and make sure that the and runtime

586
00:24:01,609 --> 00:24:03,319
security behavior for security features

587
00:24:03,319 --> 00:24:04,909
that will execute every time the system

588
00:24:04,909 --> 00:24:08,619
is built and every time it's deployed

589
00:24:09,179 --> 00:24:11,580
so this is this is sort of builds an

590
00:24:11,580 --> 00:24:14,159
intrinsic connection here security is

591
00:24:14,159 --> 00:24:17,100
actually connected with quality and and

592
00:24:17,100 --> 00:24:18,600
that is that's part of this this idea

593
00:24:18,600 --> 00:24:20,429
that a bug is a bug the bug like you

594
00:24:20,429 --> 00:24:23,220
know we need to look at ways to not just

595
00:24:23,220 --> 00:24:26,010
to approach it in this kind of you know

596
00:24:26,010 --> 00:24:28,260
risk categorization and security

597
00:24:28,260 --> 00:24:30,659
vulnerability piece so another part of

598
00:24:30,659 --> 00:24:34,830
the deficit gap survey of 2019 is that

599
00:24:34,830 --> 00:24:37,409
one in four developers find that like

600
00:24:37,409 --> 00:24:39,659
that security is synonymous with quality

601
00:24:39,659 --> 00:24:42,779
I find that to be a really helpful piece

602
00:24:42,779 --> 00:24:44,399
because I don't know if security people

603
00:24:44,399 --> 00:24:46,289
would have would have said this but

604
00:24:46,289 --> 00:24:47,970
whenever developers are asked like this

605
00:24:47,970 --> 00:24:51,630
is what they've what they've seen so I

606
00:24:51,630 --> 00:24:53,850
think being maker driven and the reason

607
00:24:53,850 --> 00:24:55,860
why I like that I kind of lead with this

608
00:24:55,860 --> 00:24:58,919
is that the start of it is it security

609
00:24:58,919 --> 00:25:01,950
is a part of engineering and we need to

610
00:25:01,950 --> 00:25:03,899
adopt that that mindset and believe that

611
00:25:03,899 --> 00:25:06,600
I think view quality is a way to bring

612
00:25:06,600 --> 00:25:09,600
security inside to do engineering and

613
00:25:09,600 --> 00:25:13,350
testing that to that spec and then we

614
00:25:13,350 --> 00:25:15,000
can use code and not not necessarily

615
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:16,950
vendors to solve problems and I feel

616
00:25:16,950 --> 00:25:18,630
like that that's really helpful for

617
00:25:18,630 --> 00:25:20,610
security because we've I think I think

618
00:25:20,610 --> 00:25:22,020
the security industry is always kind of

619
00:25:22,020 --> 00:25:25,679
leaned on on more tooling than in other

620
00:25:25,679 --> 00:25:28,409
parts of our industry all right let's

621
00:25:28,409 --> 00:25:31,380
move on to e so e is a real fun one this

622
00:25:31,380 --> 00:25:33,390
is experimenting and learning from our

623
00:25:33,390 --> 00:25:36,960
experiments so a couple of the benefits

624
00:25:36,960 --> 00:25:39,210
from experimentation its measured its

625
00:25:39,210 --> 00:25:41,640
repeatable you get results based on your

626
00:25:41,640 --> 00:25:44,700
needs I did this talk with Shannon Leitz

627
00:25:44,700 --> 00:25:49,140
over it into it and and in it there is a

628
00:25:49,140 --> 00:25:51,450
there's a whole whole thing that that we

629
00:25:51,450 --> 00:25:53,100
put together on this that I think is

630
00:25:53,100 --> 00:25:54,750
pretty helpful we give the talk over at

631
00:25:54,750 --> 00:25:56,490
RSA and another version at DevOps

632
00:25:56,490 --> 00:26:00,140
Enterprise summit late last year but

633
00:26:00,140 --> 00:26:02,279
setting up a lab environment you sort of

634
00:26:02,279 --> 00:26:04,140
see these these blue circles around this

635
00:26:04,140 --> 00:26:05,970
that's the OAuth top ten and you would

636
00:26:05,970 --> 00:26:07,500
sort of say well it's like we believe

637
00:26:07,500 --> 00:26:09,000
that it was be sort of like equally

638
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:10,649
distributed based on their weight and

639
00:26:10,649 --> 00:26:13,169
things like that but we found out that

640
00:26:13,169 --> 00:26:17,100
like four four types of attackers sort

641
00:26:17,100 --> 00:26:21,120
of clustering these other types of you

642
00:26:21,120 --> 00:26:21,929
know and the

643
00:26:21,929 --> 00:26:23,999
Quincy and then like how much how how

644
00:26:23,999 --> 00:26:26,789
successful they were in their attacks so

645
00:26:26,789 --> 00:26:28,889
you see kind of the paid noise group

646
00:26:28,889 --> 00:26:30,480
over there on the right-hand side and

647
00:26:30,480 --> 00:26:32,190
then you see a couple customers is this

648
00:26:32,190 --> 00:26:34,200
the slide builds in it's a longer talk

649
00:26:34,200 --> 00:26:34,799
than here

650
00:26:34,799 --> 00:26:37,230
the point is that through this

651
00:26:37,230 --> 00:26:38,879
experiment we're able to see like Oh

652
00:26:38,879 --> 00:26:40,499
what are the types of protections and

653
00:26:40,499 --> 00:26:41,970
defenses we need to put in place and

654
00:26:41,970 --> 00:26:44,850
they're they're different then than what

655
00:26:44,850 --> 00:26:46,080
you would think of if you were just kind

656
00:26:46,080 --> 00:26:47,490
of like punching down the OWASP top 10

657
00:26:47,490 --> 00:26:49,710
and it may be based on the type of data

658
00:26:49,710 --> 00:26:51,240
you have the type of infrastructure you

659
00:26:51,240 --> 00:26:53,669
have we could see like oh I convinced

660
00:26:53,669 --> 00:26:54,929
adversaries like those are those red

661
00:26:54,929 --> 00:26:56,399
ones like this is the kind of stuff

662
00:26:56,399 --> 00:26:57,389
they're always going through in our

663
00:26:57,389 --> 00:26:59,190
application that's helpful for us to

664
00:26:59,190 --> 00:27:01,529
know about what the real what real-world

665
00:27:01,529 --> 00:27:04,860
stuff are actually facing so I always

666
00:27:04,860 --> 00:27:06,570
kind of counsel people like try to

667
00:27:06,570 --> 00:27:08,039
figure out what matters inside of your

668
00:27:08,039 --> 00:27:10,559
application I think like always the

669
00:27:10,559 --> 00:27:12,240
hidden stuff that people miss or like

670
00:27:12,240 --> 00:27:14,070
accountant to takeover attempts or any

671
00:27:14,070 --> 00:27:16,139
any types of account or off pieces if

672
00:27:16,139 --> 00:27:17,460
you instrument all those and then you're

673
00:27:17,460 --> 00:27:19,169
able to tie that together like that's

674
00:27:19,169 --> 00:27:21,809
really helpful for folks figure out what

675
00:27:21,809 --> 00:27:23,999
areas of your site are under attack

676
00:27:23,999 --> 00:27:26,340
what what vectors are under attack if

677
00:27:26,340 --> 00:27:28,639
you have any business logic flows

678
00:27:28,639 --> 00:27:30,690
instrument those so you're able to see

679
00:27:30,690 --> 00:27:33,509
and look for abuse and misuse cases not

680
00:27:33,509 --> 00:27:35,369
just you know cross-site scripting or

681
00:27:35,369 --> 00:27:38,159
sequel injection but look like what what

682
00:27:38,159 --> 00:27:39,629
your application is actually doing an

683
00:27:39,629 --> 00:27:43,049
instrument for that the same Lackey over

684
00:27:43,049 --> 00:27:44,129
at signal Sciences

685
00:27:44,129 --> 00:27:46,769
always kind of kind of likes to say this

686
00:27:46,769 --> 00:27:48,659
that you can't see the home-field

687
00:27:48,659 --> 00:27:50,850
advantage as security people I think

688
00:27:50,850 --> 00:27:52,830
they're there's often in a security

689
00:27:52,830 --> 00:27:54,539
world I've heard people say where Oh

690
00:27:54,539 --> 00:27:56,159
like you can't build an unhackable

691
00:27:56,159 --> 00:27:59,669
system well sure but you actually know

692
00:27:59,669 --> 00:28:01,740
all the doors and the windows and you

693
00:28:01,740 --> 00:28:04,940
actually know your the your home turf so

694
00:28:04,940 --> 00:28:07,080
you know how the application is built

695
00:28:07,080 --> 00:28:09,899
how its deployed where it runs you could

696
00:28:09,899 --> 00:28:11,820
you can instrument that in a way that

697
00:28:11,820 --> 00:28:15,269
attackers wouldn't know how to look so

698
00:28:15,269 --> 00:28:17,340
you do have home-field advantage

699
00:28:17,340 --> 00:28:21,360
don't don't give that up okay so I think

700
00:28:21,360 --> 00:28:24,379
also experimenting helps us understand

701
00:28:24,379 --> 00:28:27,330
it really requires that we understand

702
00:28:27,330 --> 00:28:30,720
our steady state of our system all right

703
00:28:30,720 --> 00:28:32,549
so a couple of resources here on

704
00:28:32,549 --> 00:28:35,040
experimenting I think Shannon

705
00:28:35,040 --> 00:28:37,800
over at devstack cops on twitter is a

706
00:28:37,800 --> 00:28:39,900
great person to follow and that tough

707
00:28:39,900 --> 00:28:42,300
that she and i did are over at on

708
00:28:42,300 --> 00:28:45,500
youtube and that's at the link for it

709
00:28:45,500 --> 00:28:49,860
okay let's move on to a automation of

710
00:28:49,860 --> 00:28:52,260
things all the things get automated

711
00:28:52,260 --> 00:28:54,060
which automation is one of those things

712
00:28:54,060 --> 00:28:57,500
that we often we often go go towards

713
00:28:57,500 --> 00:29:00,450
Shannon who I mentioned earlier gave

714
00:29:00,450 --> 00:29:02,910
this talk of rid of DevOps days Austin

715
00:29:02,910 --> 00:29:05,280
and a couple years back and there is

716
00:29:05,280 --> 00:29:07,470
just like all these questions that you

717
00:29:07,470 --> 00:29:09,300
would put across your pipeline and like

718
00:29:09,300 --> 00:29:11,070
how do I secure it what tooling do I put

719
00:29:11,070 --> 00:29:13,170
in place where do I fit in I ended up

720
00:29:13,170 --> 00:29:15,720
turning I ended up thinking about that

721
00:29:15,720 --> 00:29:18,150
some more and and putting tooling across

722
00:29:18,150 --> 00:29:20,310
that and I have a course on LinkedIn

723
00:29:20,310 --> 00:29:23,190
learning on that actual topic but we

724
00:29:23,190 --> 00:29:25,410
we've we're seeing surveys across the

725
00:29:25,410 --> 00:29:28,050
industry where what how does this how

726
00:29:28,050 --> 00:29:29,520
does it fit together and whenever we're

727
00:29:29,520 --> 00:29:32,130
looking from design and architecture and

728
00:29:32,130 --> 00:29:34,260
you and your your CI CID pipeline may

729
00:29:34,260 --> 00:29:36,540
have four stages five stages six stages

730
00:29:36,540 --> 00:29:39,510
I don't know but but you can see the

731
00:29:39,510 --> 00:29:43,590
pipeline approach here and they asked

732
00:29:43,590 --> 00:29:45,090
this question like what point in your

733
00:29:45,090 --> 00:29:46,980
development process does your

734
00:29:46,980 --> 00:29:48,300
organization perform automated

735
00:29:48,300 --> 00:29:51,750
applications security analysis this is

736
00:29:51,750 --> 00:29:53,580
one where DevOps people that are that

737
00:29:53,580 --> 00:29:55,230
have been doing DevOps for a while and

738
00:29:55,230 --> 00:29:58,350
then have them obsolete practices they

739
00:29:58,350 --> 00:30:01,050
are actually outpacing their their peers

740
00:30:01,050 --> 00:30:02,730
by quite a bit in a very meaningful way

741
00:30:02,730 --> 00:30:05,850
so putting security type testing and

742
00:30:05,850 --> 00:30:07,380
development in their build and CI a--

743
00:30:07,380 --> 00:30:09,990
system during during it whenever you're

744
00:30:09,990 --> 00:30:12,600
doing QA for testing prior to release

745
00:30:12,600 --> 00:30:14,400
into production so we're seeing people

746
00:30:14,400 --> 00:30:16,380
kind of move security into the pipeline

747
00:30:16,380 --> 00:30:18,180
and and that's a real positive thing for

748
00:30:18,180 --> 00:30:21,360
us automation provides all these all

749
00:30:21,360 --> 00:30:23,040
feedbacks that these kind of these there

750
00:30:23,040 --> 00:30:24,720
are some main areas that you can look at

751
00:30:24,720 --> 00:30:27,300
if you're just getting started with this

752
00:30:27,300 --> 00:30:30,090
so at pre-commit is a great place to do

753
00:30:30,090 --> 00:30:31,770
some some linting and other pieces like

754
00:30:31,770 --> 00:30:36,360
that at build you can contest for you

755
00:30:36,360 --> 00:30:38,010
can verify all the previous stuff that

756
00:30:38,010 --> 00:30:40,550
was done and a test for additional stuff

757
00:30:40,550 --> 00:30:42,780
deployment your secrets management

758
00:30:42,780 --> 00:30:45,210
actually like exercise the application

759
00:30:45,210 --> 00:30:46,740
and it's sort of a runtime environment

760
00:30:46,740 --> 00:30:48,820
so and

761
00:30:48,820 --> 00:30:50,470
here's this is another one that I found

762
00:30:50,470 --> 00:30:53,260
quite interesting from this this survey

763
00:30:53,260 --> 00:30:57,430
you look at not having not having to

764
00:30:57,430 --> 00:30:59,020
practice and kind of orange again the

765
00:30:59,020 --> 00:31:01,390
the blue is the having more DevOps

766
00:31:01,390 --> 00:31:04,480
practices but all of these except maybe

767
00:31:04,480 --> 00:31:06,370
you know the middle container in

768
00:31:06,370 --> 00:31:08,560
application security all the other

769
00:31:08,560 --> 00:31:11,470
buckets here are all kind of like older

770
00:31:11,470 --> 00:31:14,860
security tools web application firewalls

771
00:31:14,860 --> 00:31:16,870
have been around for almost 20 years

772
00:31:16,870 --> 00:31:20,050
static application analysis about the

773
00:31:20,050 --> 00:31:23,080
same amount dynamic application analysis

774
00:31:23,080 --> 00:31:25,360
about the same amount I mean these are

775
00:31:25,360 --> 00:31:27,040
these are all sort of legacy and then

776
00:31:27,040 --> 00:31:28,960
like container and application security

777
00:31:28,960 --> 00:31:30,970
containers are newish but application

778
00:31:30,970 --> 00:31:33,610
security stuff's kind of not that old so

779
00:31:33,610 --> 00:31:36,400
there is is a bit older so but we see

780
00:31:36,400 --> 00:31:39,880
adoption and usage of these in kind of

781
00:31:39,880 --> 00:31:41,890
these the DevOps the DevOps forward

782
00:31:41,890 --> 00:31:44,320
practices - even at being outpacing

783
00:31:44,320 --> 00:31:45,730
their their peers kind of with a note

784
00:31:45,730 --> 00:31:47,860
about practice so the automation helps

785
00:31:47,860 --> 00:31:50,260
actually helps us implement more help us

786
00:31:50,260 --> 00:31:52,900
put more controls in place more places

787
00:31:52,900 --> 00:31:54,910
in the pipeline and even pull from some

788
00:31:54,910 --> 00:31:56,350
of those traditional security buckets

789
00:31:56,350 --> 00:31:58,360
and and really get those put those tools

790
00:31:58,360 --> 00:31:59,860
to work

791
00:31:59,860 --> 00:32:02,590
I like this from jazz and David's book

792
00:32:02,590 --> 00:32:05,110
on continuous delivery we think about

793
00:32:05,110 --> 00:32:06,760
how little we can deploy at any one time

794
00:32:06,760 --> 00:32:09,610
and whenever I was over at signal

795
00:32:09,610 --> 00:32:12,370
Sciences we really tried to focus on

796
00:32:12,370 --> 00:32:15,070
this where we operate we optimize for

797
00:32:15,070 --> 00:32:17,290
the total cycle time so the time you

798
00:32:17,290 --> 00:32:18,970
commit a piece of code the time it's

799
00:32:18,970 --> 00:32:21,190
running in production you want all of

800
00:32:21,190 --> 00:32:23,980
your security tests and and regular you

801
00:32:23,980 --> 00:32:25,750
know functional tests and and all your

802
00:32:25,750 --> 00:32:29,590
other suite of tests to run either you'd

803
00:32:29,590 --> 00:32:30,730
like to have that run in like five

804
00:32:30,730 --> 00:32:32,920
minutes maybe ten minutes if you have to

805
00:32:32,920 --> 00:32:35,200
but we we would often like get together

806
00:32:35,200 --> 00:32:39,130
and and and try to focus on on sliming

807
00:32:39,130 --> 00:32:40,480
that down and making sure that like

808
00:32:40,480 --> 00:32:42,430
we're still we're still hitting all the

809
00:32:42,430 --> 00:32:44,560
tests we need two ways to make them

810
00:32:44,560 --> 00:32:46,960
faster two to branch him to do whatever

811
00:32:46,960 --> 00:32:48,700
we need to make that to make that run

812
00:32:48,700 --> 00:32:50,980
because we want to make it so developers

813
00:32:50,980 --> 00:32:53,290
aren't blocked because that's that's one

814
00:32:53,290 --> 00:32:54,940
of those those key things we hit at the

815
00:32:54,940 --> 00:32:56,380
very beginning in the presentation it's

816
00:32:56,380 --> 00:32:58,600
like security is slowing things down

817
00:32:58,600 --> 00:33:00,490
like we don't want security to slow

818
00:33:00,490 --> 00:33:02,650
things down anymore we want to help

819
00:33:02,650 --> 00:33:05,020
time to go to shrinks Oh everything go

820
00:33:05,020 --> 00:33:08,920
much faster it's when while I was at

821
00:33:08,920 --> 00:33:11,200
signal Sciences we did over 15,000

822
00:33:11,200 --> 00:33:12,610
deploys and in about three and a half

823
00:33:12,610 --> 00:33:15,220
years I hope to build out that debt

824
00:33:15,220 --> 00:33:17,680
delivery pipeline over there and so it

825
00:33:17,680 --> 00:33:20,250
was really fun to kind of work on that

826
00:33:20,250 --> 00:33:22,600
but you can put security in the pipeline

827
00:33:22,600 --> 00:33:26,110
from doing you know SCA tools to linters

828
00:33:26,110 --> 00:33:29,260
and and checking for get secrets I work

829
00:33:29,260 --> 00:33:30,400
on an open source project called

830
00:33:30,400 --> 00:33:33,550
gauntlet which is which is a way to like

831
00:33:33,550 --> 00:33:35,260
put scanners inside of your CI CD

832
00:33:35,260 --> 00:33:37,870
pipeline doing monitoring and telemetry

833
00:33:37,870 --> 00:33:40,510
on the on the outside whenever you're

834
00:33:40,510 --> 00:33:42,550
able to see you know what people are

835
00:33:42,550 --> 00:33:44,650
doing thinking about production what

836
00:33:44,650 --> 00:33:46,960
ways signal Sciences provides like that

837
00:33:46,960 --> 00:33:51,460
kind of feedback for you so the whole

838
00:33:51,460 --> 00:33:52,990
point of it is that we started to build

839
00:33:52,990 --> 00:33:54,340
out this pipeline and then we were

840
00:33:54,340 --> 00:33:57,040
trying to work with auditors to say and

841
00:33:57,040 --> 00:33:58,810
this is what the agile application

842
00:33:58,810 --> 00:34:00,370
security book says as well as like you

843
00:34:00,370 --> 00:34:01,840
can start treating your deploys as

844
00:34:01,840 --> 00:34:03,250
standard or routine changes that have

845
00:34:03,250 --> 00:34:04,690
been pre-approved by management and you

846
00:34:04,690 --> 00:34:06,870
don't have to do these change code

847
00:34:06,870 --> 00:34:10,090
change control boards or you know you're

848
00:34:10,090 --> 00:34:11,350
not requiring all this heavy heavy

849
00:34:11,350 --> 00:34:12,760
change review management

850
00:34:12,760 --> 00:34:17,020
so with this have some resources I

851
00:34:17,020 --> 00:34:19,360
mentioned this earlier I forgot that

852
00:34:19,360 --> 00:34:21,940
this slide in here but yeah so we have I

853
00:34:21,940 --> 00:34:23,590
have a course on this if you want to

854
00:34:23,590 --> 00:34:25,780
actually walk through a building a CI C

855
00:34:25,780 --> 00:34:27,639
D pipeline that has security tools built

856
00:34:27,639 --> 00:34:31,030
in and you have an hour in eight minutes

857
00:34:31,030 --> 00:34:34,050
it looks like you can you can do it and

858
00:34:34,050 --> 00:34:36,909
then then have an another course that's

859
00:34:36,909 --> 00:34:39,100
just on automating like security testing

860
00:34:39,100 --> 00:34:40,360
and it's more of a deeper dive with

861
00:34:40,360 --> 00:34:43,270
gauntlet and and that's looks like about

862
00:34:43,270 --> 00:34:45,370
an hour and 35 minutes so just in like

863
00:34:45,370 --> 00:34:46,570
less than the time it takes to watch

864
00:34:46,570 --> 00:34:49,000
Braveheart you could just pretty old

865
00:34:49,000 --> 00:34:51,399
movie reference but you could learn all

866
00:34:51,399 --> 00:34:56,080
those things right all right so so the

867
00:34:56,080 --> 00:34:59,440
next one is safety and so we talked

868
00:34:59,440 --> 00:35:01,210
about safety aware safety for complex

869
00:35:01,210 --> 00:35:04,270
systems I'd like to to dive in here a

870
00:35:04,270 --> 00:35:05,800
little bit and this is an area that I

871
00:35:05,800 --> 00:35:08,440
feel is growing for security and I feel

872
00:35:08,440 --> 00:35:10,630
security has a lot to learn from the

873
00:35:10,630 --> 00:35:12,520
safety folks so we're going to just

874
00:35:12,520 --> 00:35:14,950
we're going to cover this and then you

875
00:35:14,950 --> 00:35:16,020
know honestly like there's

876
00:35:16,020 --> 00:35:18,870
more room to grow here first I think

877
00:35:18,870 --> 00:35:20,490
it's helpful if we start thinking about

878
00:35:20,490 --> 00:35:23,010
simple systems versus complex systems

879
00:35:23,010 --> 00:35:24,990
and then understand which ones do we

880
00:35:24,990 --> 00:35:27,450
have so if you can think about a simple

881
00:35:27,450 --> 00:35:28,170
system

882
00:35:28,170 --> 00:35:31,070
they're often linear in nature you can

883
00:35:31,070 --> 00:35:34,050
you can take a you know the components

884
00:35:34,050 --> 00:35:36,090
and you can look at them and you are

885
00:35:36,090 --> 00:35:38,070
able to predict to the outcome you know

886
00:35:38,070 --> 00:35:40,260
when you know maybe when two things

887
00:35:40,260 --> 00:35:41,850
collide or something like this is

888
00:35:41,850 --> 00:35:43,140
something you can model in physics

889
00:35:43,140 --> 00:35:46,020
pretty easily you're able to comprehend

890
00:35:46,020 --> 00:35:47,520
the entire system you know all the

891
00:35:47,520 --> 00:35:51,270
actors all the pieces it's a it's

892
00:35:51,270 --> 00:35:52,770
something that kind of is the mental

893
00:35:52,770 --> 00:35:54,420
model more or less fits in inside of

894
00:35:54,420 --> 00:35:58,350
your head okay but complex systems

895
00:35:58,350 --> 00:36:00,390
that's that's a little bit of a

896
00:36:00,390 --> 00:36:02,520
different problem we have they're

897
00:36:02,520 --> 00:36:07,010
nonlinear so a small change or small a

898
00:36:07,010 --> 00:36:09,690
small change on one end can have a

899
00:36:09,690 --> 00:36:12,450
dramatic change on the other the classic

900
00:36:12,450 --> 00:36:14,430
example here is like the bullwhip just a

901
00:36:14,430 --> 00:36:16,830
small flick of your wrist will create

902
00:36:16,830 --> 00:36:20,010
downstream you know a you know a piece

903
00:36:20,010 --> 00:36:24,180
of the the whip that is now you know

904
00:36:24,180 --> 00:36:28,400
breaking the sound barrier so it's a

905
00:36:28,400 --> 00:36:31,050
like like that is that's that's a pretty

906
00:36:31,050 --> 00:36:33,060
good example like a nonlinear type

907
00:36:33,060 --> 00:36:35,490
system or like a you know an effect that

908
00:36:35,490 --> 00:36:38,910
happens in a way that you know you

909
00:36:38,910 --> 00:36:40,560
wouldn't have thought of like that that

910
00:36:40,560 --> 00:36:43,050
would happen they're unpredictable in

911
00:36:43,050 --> 00:36:45,990
nature and I thought my last line got

912
00:36:45,990 --> 00:36:48,150
cut off here but you're not able to put

913
00:36:48,150 --> 00:36:49,740
the whole mental model inside of your

914
00:36:49,740 --> 00:36:51,780
head like that no no one person can just

915
00:36:51,780 --> 00:36:54,990
say like I understand you I can

916
00:36:54,990 --> 00:36:56,610
understand if we make one change here in

917
00:36:56,610 --> 00:36:58,620
our supply chain that further down like

918
00:36:58,620 --> 00:37:02,070
it's going to have this ripple effect so

919
00:37:02,070 --> 00:37:05,520
in in in our world like yeah we abstract

920
00:37:05,520 --> 00:37:06,870
complexity and that's what we actually

921
00:37:06,870 --> 00:37:09,630
do that pretty well with software we we

922
00:37:09,630 --> 00:37:15,240
do it with humans we do it in society we

923
00:37:15,240 --> 00:37:18,540
do it psychologically there's we try to

924
00:37:18,540 --> 00:37:20,160
reduce all of our cognitive load that it

925
00:37:20,160 --> 00:37:22,830
takes to deal with with deal with

926
00:37:22,830 --> 00:37:25,440
complexity and so you know because

927
00:37:25,440 --> 00:37:28,860
humans in them in our selves singular is

928
00:37:28,860 --> 00:37:29,280
we're

929
00:37:29,280 --> 00:37:31,230
complex systems and then we kind of like

930
00:37:31,230 --> 00:37:33,360
say all right well in this group of you

931
00:37:33,360 --> 00:37:35,040
know part of society like we abstract

932
00:37:35,040 --> 00:37:36,840
that as well it would try to like group

933
00:37:36,840 --> 00:37:38,220
and classify things because we're always

934
00:37:38,220 --> 00:37:39,930
trying to like get to more of a simple

935
00:37:39,930 --> 00:37:42,090
system in our mind because we can't we

936
00:37:42,090 --> 00:37:44,460
can't deal with this we do the exact

937
00:37:44,460 --> 00:37:46,950
same thing in software right we deal

938
00:37:46,950 --> 00:37:49,080
with complexity through abstracting this

939
00:37:49,080 --> 00:37:52,770
out to some other type of system and

940
00:37:52,770 --> 00:37:54,960
this is why you know you often hear

941
00:37:54,960 --> 00:37:57,240
people say like root causes a myth it's

942
00:37:57,240 --> 00:37:58,170
not because they're just trying to be

943
00:37:58,170 --> 00:38:00,720
dramatic or whatever it's because in a

944
00:38:00,720 --> 00:38:04,080
complex system it is you lack a full

945
00:38:04,080 --> 00:38:07,650
picture you're you you have this like

946
00:38:07,650 --> 00:38:11,040
nonlinear nature of the system often

947
00:38:11,040 --> 00:38:13,830
this kind of comes from like our history

948
00:38:13,830 --> 00:38:15,570
of how we sort of have built out like

949
00:38:15,570 --> 00:38:18,510
blame cultures and many organizations a

950
00:38:18,510 --> 00:38:20,310
lot of times even if we can point to

951
00:38:20,310 --> 00:38:22,680
like a couple pieces that that went

952
00:38:22,680 --> 00:38:24,680
wrong that we forget all of the

953
00:38:24,680 --> 00:38:26,610
organizational societal and all the

954
00:38:26,610 --> 00:38:29,190
other type pieces that went into the

955
00:38:29,190 --> 00:38:30,570
decisions that happen that they made

956
00:38:30,570 --> 00:38:33,360
this happen and it puts whenever we

957
00:38:33,360 --> 00:38:35,220
think of root cause like it puts focus

958
00:38:35,220 --> 00:38:36,780
on the event over the entire situation

959
00:38:36,780 --> 00:38:38,880
is all so that we need to think of more

960
00:38:38,880 --> 00:38:42,660
situational analysis here so some books

961
00:38:42,660 --> 00:38:44,610
that I like on this topic I've been

962
00:38:44,610 --> 00:38:46,890
reading this book drift into failure by

963
00:38:46,890 --> 00:38:49,680
Sidney Becker and here's this quote that

964
00:38:49,680 --> 00:38:51,450
I think is pretty helpful drifting into

965
00:38:51,450 --> 00:38:53,580
failure is a gradual incremental decline

966
00:38:53,580 --> 00:38:55,290
and is it a disaster driven by

967
00:38:55,290 --> 00:38:58,110
environmental pressure unruly technology

968
00:38:58,110 --> 00:39:00,420
and social processes that normalize

969
00:39:00,420 --> 00:39:03,300
growing risk no organization is exempt

970
00:39:03,300 --> 00:39:06,600
from drifting into failure something

971
00:39:06,600 --> 00:39:08,670
that's pretty familiar to us if you've

972
00:39:08,670 --> 00:39:10,530
been following the news the Boeing 737

973
00:39:10,530 --> 00:39:13,950
maxes have have dealt with this they

974
00:39:13,950 --> 00:39:17,850
have the they have the the sub system

975
00:39:17,850 --> 00:39:21,720
that is in charge of you know a plane

976
00:39:21,720 --> 00:39:22,950
trim and making sure the airplane

977
00:39:22,950 --> 00:39:26,060
doesn't stall out the MCAS system and

978
00:39:26,060 --> 00:39:29,460
sometimes in certain scenarios that

979
00:39:29,460 --> 00:39:31,920
system works and you know trims the

980
00:39:31,920 --> 00:39:34,410
plane without notifying the ply it the

981
00:39:34,410 --> 00:39:36,410
pilots and it kind of takes over and

982
00:39:36,410 --> 00:39:38,790
important for us is like this is

983
00:39:38,790 --> 00:39:40,830
software like when you read about the

984
00:39:40,830 --> 00:39:42,930
the fixes it's not like they're adding

985
00:39:42,930 --> 00:39:45,150
you know new flaps or any I'm not a not

986
00:39:45,150 --> 00:39:47,280
a pilot but they're not they're not

987
00:39:47,280 --> 00:39:50,010
changing the structure of the plane

988
00:39:50,010 --> 00:39:52,349
they're like doing a you know patch to

989
00:39:52,349 --> 00:39:56,400
the software and when you read through

990
00:39:56,400 --> 00:39:58,680
the events in the accounts and Jay Paul

991
00:39:58,680 --> 00:40:00,150
Reid on Twitter

992
00:40:00,150 --> 00:40:02,250
he's got a great article on medium on

993
00:40:02,250 --> 00:40:03,720
this I think I've a link to here at the

994
00:40:03,720 --> 00:40:06,390
end of this section but the events have

995
00:40:06,390 --> 00:40:09,329
unfolded in minutes the software was

996
00:40:09,329 --> 00:40:11,160
fighting the pilots and it was doing it

997
00:40:11,160 --> 00:40:13,109
silently so that they had had no idea

998
00:40:13,109 --> 00:40:16,559
and the system knew the airplane was

999
00:40:16,559 --> 00:40:18,660
sort of in every way mimicking to them

1000
00:40:18,660 --> 00:40:20,940
that that they thought they were just

1001
00:40:20,940 --> 00:40:24,329
operating like they're like a 737 pretty

1002
00:40:24,329 --> 00:40:25,800
much like they've always operated you

1003
00:40:25,800 --> 00:40:27,510
know as a newer updated version but it

1004
00:40:27,510 --> 00:40:30,390
looked and felt to them like it was the

1005
00:40:30,390 --> 00:40:34,440
same and whenever I read this and I

1006
00:40:34,440 --> 00:40:35,670
started thinking through this it's like

1007
00:40:35,670 --> 00:40:37,650
oh like there's a lot of impact here

1008
00:40:37,650 --> 00:40:39,869
from from safety into this security side

1009
00:40:39,869 --> 00:40:41,819
like high-speed decision-making sounds

1010
00:40:41,819 --> 00:40:45,089
just a little too familiar to me and we

1011
00:40:45,089 --> 00:40:47,190
see that software is you know taking

1012
00:40:47,190 --> 00:40:48,780
over this taking over the world we see

1013
00:40:48,780 --> 00:40:50,250
the eating the world and this this

1014
00:40:50,250 --> 00:40:52,890
growth of complexity that that's

1015
00:40:52,890 --> 00:40:54,510
happening and then there's this quote

1016
00:40:54,510 --> 00:40:56,040
from Sydney Decker says the growth of

1017
00:40:56,040 --> 00:40:58,410
complexity in society has gotten ahead

1018
00:40:58,410 --> 00:41:00,089
of our understanding of how complex

1019
00:41:00,089 --> 00:41:04,710
systems work in how they fail and I just

1020
00:41:04,710 --> 00:41:05,940
pulled this from like you know this

1021
00:41:05,940 --> 00:41:09,150
Microsoft services architecture from

1022
00:41:09,150 --> 00:41:12,270
just kind of a you know random part part

1023
00:41:12,270 --> 00:41:14,430
of the internet and this is something

1024
00:41:14,430 --> 00:41:16,049
that yeah you can't model on your head

1025
00:41:16,049 --> 00:41:18,240
either the three-tier application

1026
00:41:18,240 --> 00:41:20,369
doesn't doesn't fit neatly in your in

1027
00:41:20,369 --> 00:41:22,500
your mind anymore you can't go to a rack

1028
00:41:22,500 --> 00:41:24,750
or even like you know some virtual boxes

1029
00:41:24,750 --> 00:41:25,980
and just be like oh like here do these

1030
00:41:25,980 --> 00:41:27,829
these are the machines that do the thing

1031
00:41:27,829 --> 00:41:31,140
now it's like it's everywhere it's all

1032
00:41:31,140 --> 00:41:32,670
connected and it's hard for us to figure

1033
00:41:32,670 --> 00:41:36,030
this out my friend Matt Stein says this

1034
00:41:36,030 --> 00:41:38,760
it's like I don't know exactly know the

1035
00:41:38,760 --> 00:41:41,819
context but I hope it's in something to

1036
00:41:41,819 --> 00:41:43,619
do with do it this but it's it's

1037
00:41:43,619 --> 00:41:45,119
becoming clear to me now software was

1038
00:41:45,119 --> 00:41:47,040
probably a mistake right and I think

1039
00:41:47,040 --> 00:41:48,210
it's easy to feel that way whenever

1040
00:41:48,210 --> 00:41:50,069
we're dealing with these complex systems

1041
00:41:50,069 --> 00:41:51,990
and we left kind of that the burden of

1042
00:41:51,990 --> 00:41:55,470
that that fit on here but the reason why

1043
00:41:55,470 --> 00:41:56,880
I bring all this up is

1044
00:41:56,880 --> 00:41:59,819
because we're now like we've put

1045
00:41:59,819 --> 00:42:02,640
operations in security we've kind of

1046
00:42:02,640 --> 00:42:03,990
moved that burden to them where they're

1047
00:42:03,990 --> 00:42:05,369
supposed to rationalize these system

1048
00:42:05,369 --> 00:42:07,200
models that are somewhat you're

1049
00:42:07,200 --> 00:42:09,630
rationalizing like you can't you can't

1050
00:42:09,630 --> 00:42:14,730
figure this out and Adrian Cockroft has

1051
00:42:14,730 --> 00:42:16,380
this quote he says that we see failures

1052
00:42:16,380 --> 00:42:20,579
and systems not because because there is

1053
00:42:20,579 --> 00:42:24,299
not enough safety margin and so I think

1054
00:42:24,299 --> 00:42:25,920
there is it there is a change that we're

1055
00:42:25,920 --> 00:42:28,309
going to see happen across our industry

1056
00:42:28,309 --> 00:42:30,869
and then we're going to start trying to

1057
00:42:30,869 --> 00:42:32,849
account for this this is some of the

1058
00:42:32,849 --> 00:42:34,049
work that we're doing over at Varick

1059
00:42:34,049 --> 00:42:35,910
alike we're helping to try to make this

1060
00:42:35,910 --> 00:42:37,890
make this change different we're taking

1061
00:42:37,890 --> 00:42:39,420
a lot of the the principles that a chaos

1062
00:42:39,420 --> 00:42:42,720
engineering to do some of this so and

1063
00:42:42,720 --> 00:42:44,579
and we can't convince ourselves like

1064
00:42:44,579 --> 00:42:45,990
there is no other way to do it because

1065
00:42:45,990 --> 00:42:48,329
failure is an inevitable byproduct of a

1066
00:42:48,329 --> 00:42:51,839
complex systems normal functioning so

1067
00:42:51,839 --> 00:42:53,670
security fits in was where we we add

1068
00:42:53,670 --> 00:42:56,039
safety margin we put telemetry and

1069
00:42:56,039 --> 00:42:58,289
information instrumentation in places we

1070
00:42:58,289 --> 00:43:00,150
learn how to do blameless retrospectives

1071
00:43:00,150 --> 00:43:02,190
and I think there's more to explore in

1072
00:43:02,190 --> 00:43:04,890
this area so here's some there's a book

1073
00:43:04,890 --> 00:43:08,069
there's a video series that recommend if

1074
00:43:08,069 --> 00:43:09,210
you're interested in that coverage on

1075
00:43:09,210 --> 00:43:11,039
Boeing I think that's pretty helpful and

1076
00:43:11,039 --> 00:43:12,480
then Richard Cooke has a paper on how

1077
00:43:12,480 --> 00:43:15,509
complex systems fail that if you haven't

1078
00:43:15,509 --> 00:43:16,890
read that like that's that's one of the

1079
00:43:16,890 --> 00:43:18,390
really key papers to read and I have

1080
00:43:18,390 --> 00:43:19,769
that link here in the bottom here as

1081
00:43:19,769 --> 00:43:23,910
well ok let's move on to unrestrained

1082
00:43:23,910 --> 00:43:27,359
sharing so culture is the most important

1083
00:43:27,359 --> 00:43:29,400
aspect to DevOps exceeding the

1084
00:43:29,400 --> 00:43:33,079
enterprise says Patrick Dubois circa

1085
00:43:33,079 --> 00:43:36,450
2011 right early on when DevOps was

1086
00:43:36,450 --> 00:43:40,500
getting started I worked at a large

1087
00:43:40,500 --> 00:43:42,509
enterprise we were kind of incubating a

1088
00:43:42,509 --> 00:43:48,329
DevOps group there excuse me and and we

1089
00:43:48,329 --> 00:43:51,420
were actually featured in this IT cutter

1090
00:43:51,420 --> 00:43:55,650
journal that Patrick was doing and and I

1091
00:43:55,650 --> 00:43:56,970
just want to say this like from the very

1092
00:43:56,970 --> 00:43:58,349
beginning like we were thinking like how

1093
00:43:58,349 --> 00:43:59,910
do we how do we do

1094
00:43:59,910 --> 00:44:01,980
DevOps in this enterprise context

1095
00:44:01,980 --> 00:44:03,180
because at that point a lot of like

1096
00:44:03,180 --> 00:44:04,650
startups were doing it but like not a

1097
00:44:04,650 --> 00:44:06,059
lot of like large enterprises were

1098
00:44:06,059 --> 00:44:08,700
taking part but Patrick had this kind of

1099
00:44:08,700 --> 00:44:10,140
a guiding light principle I think that

1100
00:44:10,140 --> 00:44:10,770
it's like

1101
00:44:10,770 --> 00:44:12,839
culture is how we is how we do this and

1102
00:44:12,839 --> 00:44:15,869
so I think we start thinking about

1103
00:44:15,869 --> 00:44:19,050
devstack ops we need to think about how

1104
00:44:19,050 --> 00:44:22,080
do we extend DevOps culture so that we

1105
00:44:22,080 --> 00:44:25,560
can bring security inside of that and I

1106
00:44:25,560 --> 00:44:27,300
think security sees this as well

1107
00:44:27,300 --> 00:44:29,609
security sees that like embracing a

1108
00:44:29,609 --> 00:44:31,200
cultural of openness and like being able

1109
00:44:31,200 --> 00:44:33,900
to share with others and this is a

1110
00:44:33,900 --> 00:44:35,490
Richard Smith whenever he's over at Etsy

1111
00:44:35,490 --> 00:44:37,230
he said a security team who embraces

1112
00:44:37,230 --> 00:44:38,910
openness about what it does and why

1113
00:44:38,910 --> 00:44:43,830
spreads understanding so this should say

1114
00:44:43,830 --> 00:44:45,390
sharing affects culture I got some like

1115
00:44:45,390 --> 00:44:49,859
chopping here on the res but so but this

1116
00:44:49,859 --> 00:44:52,109
is the problem here is that sharing and

1117
00:44:52,109 --> 00:44:54,240
unrestrained sharing goes against the

1118
00:44:54,240 --> 00:44:55,470
Securities like standard operating

1119
00:44:55,470 --> 00:44:58,290
procedure and I think for a lot of

1120
00:44:58,290 --> 00:44:59,880
security people this feels uncomfortable

1121
00:44:59,880 --> 00:45:04,560
for them but you have to overcome that

1122
00:45:04,560 --> 00:45:06,030
so we have to figure out ways to like

1123
00:45:06,030 --> 00:45:08,310
share tools or like version you know

1124
00:45:08,310 --> 00:45:09,960
some sort of ways to like help get other

1125
00:45:09,960 --> 00:45:12,390
people involved in in the defence of

1126
00:45:12,390 --> 00:45:13,880
cooling that we put in place through

1127
00:45:13,880 --> 00:45:15,930
through chat ops and through other

1128
00:45:15,930 --> 00:45:18,900
options to help do this because this

1129
00:45:18,900 --> 00:45:20,580
this is how we start bringing down silos

1130
00:45:20,580 --> 00:45:22,470
so like it helps developers care about

1131
00:45:22,470 --> 00:45:24,150
Security's concerns when they know like

1132
00:45:24,150 --> 00:45:26,400
the security has them and like that has

1133
00:45:26,400 --> 00:45:28,080
have some sort of insight into what they

1134
00:45:28,080 --> 00:45:30,869
what they possibly could be so I have

1135
00:45:30,869 --> 00:45:32,490
these I believe in that there's like

1136
00:45:32,490 --> 00:45:34,109
four views of culture or four keys to

1137
00:45:34,109 --> 00:45:36,290
culture so having a mutual understanding

1138
00:45:36,290 --> 00:45:38,730
creating a shared language having shared

1139
00:45:38,730 --> 00:45:40,380
views and putting the tooling in place

1140
00:45:40,380 --> 00:45:41,490
that kind of builds that sort of

1141
00:45:41,490 --> 00:45:45,150
collaboration around it some of the

1142
00:45:45,150 --> 00:45:48,180
challenges that you can see with

1143
00:45:48,180 --> 00:45:51,089
applications and security this I found

1144
00:45:51,089 --> 00:45:51,990
this like to be a really interesting

1145
00:45:51,990 --> 00:45:55,530
question because you know people are

1146
00:45:55,530 --> 00:45:56,670
like well sometimes you find about

1147
00:45:56,670 --> 00:45:58,650
problems too late in the process that's

1148
00:45:58,650 --> 00:46:00,570
kind of an expected answer but right

1149
00:46:00,570 --> 00:46:02,940
dead center here it says it's not clear

1150
00:46:02,940 --> 00:46:05,490
of what's expected of us and it's like

1151
00:46:05,490 --> 00:46:06,810
it didn't matter if you're like DevOps

1152
00:46:06,810 --> 00:46:10,500
elite practice or no DevOps like 20% of

1153
00:46:10,500 --> 00:46:13,980
the folks believe that like we enough

1154
00:46:13,980 --> 00:46:16,320
developers have no idea what security

1155
00:46:16,320 --> 00:46:19,200
even expects and so like that's that's a

1156
00:46:19,200 --> 00:46:20,910
significant problem it doesn't matter

1157
00:46:20,910 --> 00:46:23,160
like if they they have DevOps or not so

1158
00:46:23,160 --> 00:46:24,210
I feel like that's it that's a

1159
00:46:24,210 --> 00:46:26,369
we need to get a you know need to bring

1160
00:46:26,369 --> 00:46:30,210
people together so I feel like how you

1161
00:46:30,210 --> 00:46:32,430
do this you kind of help make make the

1162
00:46:32,430 --> 00:46:34,680
invisible things as visible think about

1163
00:46:34,680 --> 00:46:36,390
putting security observability type

1164
00:46:36,390 --> 00:46:37,830
tools in place or monitoring in place

1165
00:46:37,830 --> 00:46:39,680
that helps helps pull those together

1166
00:46:39,680 --> 00:46:42,750
adding in api's and web hooks and like

1167
00:46:42,750 --> 00:46:44,970
integrating out of those old security

1168
00:46:44,970 --> 00:46:46,440
tools like that we looked at the cross a

1169
00:46:46,440 --> 00:46:48,450
pipeline there's ways to kind of

1170
00:46:48,450 --> 00:46:50,250
integrate that into our pipeline that

1171
00:46:50,250 --> 00:46:52,290
that that add the right hooks and

1172
00:46:52,290 --> 00:46:55,560
tooling in place and it gives you know I

1173
00:46:55,560 --> 00:46:57,599
think as we think about security and

1174
00:46:57,599 --> 00:47:00,390
even like security observability gives

1175
00:47:00,390 --> 00:47:02,010
the applications the ability to expose

1176
00:47:02,010 --> 00:47:03,570
the attacks that are happening below the

1177
00:47:03,570 --> 00:47:07,230
surface this is an iceberg here but you

1178
00:47:07,230 --> 00:47:08,640
we can focus like we talked about

1179
00:47:08,640 --> 00:47:10,020
earlier on it's like you can focus on

1180
00:47:10,020 --> 00:47:12,060
just like the injection type of attacks

1181
00:47:12,060 --> 00:47:15,150
but what's actually happening in your

1182
00:47:15,150 --> 00:47:16,770
actual production environment like those

1183
00:47:16,770 --> 00:47:18,780
are actually useful for developers to

1184
00:47:18,780 --> 00:47:20,400
care about as well our operations to

1185
00:47:20,400 --> 00:47:22,890
care about as well and so by knowing

1186
00:47:22,890 --> 00:47:24,390
what they are what's going on below the

1187
00:47:24,390 --> 00:47:26,280
surface that it kind of helps share with

1188
00:47:26,280 --> 00:47:30,390
dev ops and security over at the Netflix

1189
00:47:30,390 --> 00:47:32,730
Jason Chan has really kind of kind of

1190
00:47:32,730 --> 00:47:34,740
done this the paved road approach and I

1191
00:47:34,740 --> 00:47:36,810
really appreciate that and I think

1192
00:47:36,810 --> 00:47:40,140
that's a pretty good way to go but they

1193
00:47:40,140 --> 00:47:41,970
sort of see security is a normal thing

1194
00:47:41,970 --> 00:47:44,250
and you get it for quote-unquote free if

1195
00:47:44,250 --> 00:47:47,339
you use the paved road at Netflix they

1196
00:47:47,339 --> 00:47:48,630
have a decentralized management

1197
00:47:48,630 --> 00:47:50,430
structure so no one's required to do

1198
00:47:50,430 --> 00:47:54,180
this but security things go faster

1199
00:47:54,180 --> 00:47:55,650
things go easier for you you already

1200
00:47:55,650 --> 00:47:57,300
gets like security as part of the

1201
00:47:57,300 --> 00:47:59,070
process and you just use like their

1202
00:47:59,070 --> 00:48:01,619
their pipelines and take take part of it

1203
00:48:01,619 --> 00:48:05,220
with their images but one group there

1204
00:48:05,220 --> 00:48:06,750
always gets left out and this happens

1205
00:48:06,750 --> 00:48:08,490
everywhere is that it's the auditors

1206
00:48:08,490 --> 00:48:09,960
like we don't want to tell the auditors

1207
00:48:09,960 --> 00:48:12,330
what's going on with all the kubernetes

1208
00:48:12,330 --> 00:48:14,130
or the server lists or whatever is what

1209
00:48:14,130 --> 00:48:16,790
we're doing and a group of us got

1210
00:48:16,790 --> 00:48:20,430
together about a year ago and created

1211
00:48:20,430 --> 00:48:22,290
this project called dear auditor and

1212
00:48:22,290 --> 00:48:24,359
it's on dear auditor doors but it's a

1213
00:48:24,359 --> 00:48:27,690
love letter from DevOps practitioners to

1214
00:48:27,690 --> 00:48:29,670
promise to bring at dev psych ops

1215
00:48:29,670 --> 00:48:32,520
practitioners to bring the auditors

1216
00:48:32,520 --> 00:48:34,589
along for the journey and so in if

1217
00:48:34,589 --> 00:48:36,510
there's a DevOps risk controls matrix as

1218
00:48:36,510 --> 00:48:37,410
well and it's a

1219
00:48:37,410 --> 00:48:39,450
on github so it's you can can fork it

1220
00:48:39,450 --> 00:48:42,780
and participate in it so some resources

1221
00:48:42,780 --> 00:48:45,180
we have here are the Phoenix project I

1222
00:48:45,180 --> 00:48:46,530
think it's a great book on I'm kind of

1223
00:48:46,530 --> 00:48:48,900
bridging this gap agile application

1224
00:48:48,900 --> 00:48:51,990
security book in dear Auditor org okay

1225
00:48:51,990 --> 00:48:53,360
just got a couple more and then we'll

1226
00:48:53,360 --> 00:48:55,560
we'll kind of move into questions so

1227
00:48:55,560 --> 00:48:58,970
this next one is ruggedized ation

1228
00:48:58,970 --> 00:49:03,360
alright so you know we we had we have to

1229
00:49:03,360 --> 00:49:06,420
think about we have to think about how

1230
00:49:06,420 --> 00:49:07,830
how we're going to deal with our

1231
00:49:07,830 --> 00:49:10,830
software and I think having first step

1232
00:49:10,830 --> 00:49:12,720
is like how do you recognize something

1233
00:49:12,720 --> 00:49:14,490
first you got to know what you have

1234
00:49:14,490 --> 00:49:15,870
right and I think the software build

1235
00:49:15,870 --> 00:49:18,710
materials is to know what you have so

1236
00:49:18,710 --> 00:49:20,820
getting a lot of cutouts here like this

1237
00:49:20,820 --> 00:49:22,800
software Bill of and then materials is

1238
00:49:22,800 --> 00:49:24,420
just mysteriously going so there you go

1239
00:49:24,420 --> 00:49:28,110
Dex said yes so and I you know we

1240
00:49:28,110 --> 00:49:29,340
believe that we should favor for

1241
00:49:29,340 --> 00:49:31,110
short-lived systems so this is the

1242
00:49:31,110 --> 00:49:34,470
cattle not pets set up Sunil over at

1243
00:49:34,470 --> 00:49:36,270
Bank of America is working on this

1244
00:49:36,270 --> 00:49:37,770
framework called the diaphragm work just

1245
00:49:37,770 --> 00:49:40,800
to prove and a research paper on this to

1246
00:49:40,800 --> 00:49:42,360
prove that distributed immutable and

1247
00:49:42,360 --> 00:49:43,680
ephemeral those three aspects you have

1248
00:49:43,680 --> 00:49:45,450
that in your system you have you

1249
00:49:45,450 --> 00:49:47,010
automatically have a more secure system

1250
00:49:47,010 --> 00:49:49,140
and he's working on some really cool

1251
00:49:49,140 --> 00:49:51,630
stuff on that and I believe organization

1252
00:49:51,630 --> 00:49:54,210
into in 2020 so over the next 18 months

1253
00:49:54,210 --> 00:49:56,130
like what is this what does this look

1254
00:49:56,130 --> 00:49:57,990
like I believe there's two main

1255
00:49:57,990 --> 00:49:59,970
categories one is deception and the

1256
00:49:59,970 --> 00:50:03,270
other is chaos engineering so deception

1257
00:50:03,270 --> 00:50:05,040
looks like things like putting honey

1258
00:50:05,040 --> 00:50:06,870
pots and tar pits and man traps and that

1259
00:50:06,870 --> 00:50:09,000
other stuff inside of your system you

1260
00:50:09,000 --> 00:50:10,800
know even really really simple stuff

1261
00:50:10,800 --> 00:50:14,180
like HTTP headers and then being able to

1262
00:50:14,180 --> 00:50:16,830
know where the attackers are going so

1263
00:50:16,830 --> 00:50:18,780
this is kind of knowing that the

1264
00:50:18,780 --> 00:50:21,300
problems that you're facing and that is

1265
00:50:21,300 --> 00:50:23,310
a more I mean think about this in a you

1266
00:50:23,310 --> 00:50:24,570
can give it in a physical environment

1267
00:50:24,570 --> 00:50:26,400
you know you look at a castle or

1268
00:50:26,400 --> 00:50:30,030
whatever those are types of like rugged

1269
00:50:30,030 --> 00:50:30,510
ization

1270
00:50:30,510 --> 00:50:33,300
type principles at play we don't have

1271
00:50:33,300 --> 00:50:35,040
enough time to explore all that but but

1272
00:50:35,040 --> 00:50:37,440
honey pie and deception logic are two

1273
00:50:37,440 --> 00:50:39,600
honey pies free deception logics a paid

1274
00:50:39,600 --> 00:50:41,640
thing but there's I think there's a lot

1275
00:50:41,640 --> 00:50:42,720
of growth in this and I've been seeing

1276
00:50:42,720 --> 00:50:44,130
some really good talks kind of going on

1277
00:50:44,130 --> 00:50:46,260
right now for people doing this and then

1278
00:50:46,260 --> 00:50:47,850
second we're moving from this disaster

1279
00:50:47,850 --> 00:50:50,340
recovery belief and then we

1280
00:50:50,340 --> 00:50:52,500
into chaos engineering and then we end

1281
00:50:52,500 --> 00:50:54,300
up moving into resiliency and I find

1282
00:50:54,300 --> 00:50:56,190
that is really helpful

1283
00:50:56,190 --> 00:50:58,020
Michael Nygaard has a book release it

1284
00:50:58,020 --> 00:50:59,160
and but it's only in the second edition

1285
00:50:59,160 --> 00:51:00,630
but he has a whole section on chaos

1286
00:51:00,630 --> 00:51:02,130
engineering which I find pretty helpful

1287
00:51:02,130 --> 00:51:03,330
so if you're interested in this topic

1288
00:51:03,330 --> 00:51:06,120
check it out but he says chaos

1289
00:51:06,120 --> 00:51:07,620
engineering is empirical rather than

1290
00:51:07,620 --> 00:51:10,440
formal we don't use models to understand

1291
00:51:10,440 --> 00:51:11,820
what the system should do we run

1292
00:51:11,820 --> 00:51:13,260
experiments to learn what it actually

1293
00:51:13,260 --> 00:51:15,660
does so we get to know our system in a

1294
00:51:15,660 --> 00:51:18,030
more deeper way on this complex system

1295
00:51:18,030 --> 00:51:19,590
that we're not able to really model but

1296
00:51:19,590 --> 00:51:22,130
we can uncover truths about the system

1297
00:51:22,130 --> 00:51:25,230
and and chaos engineering does this so

1298
00:51:25,230 --> 00:51:27,360
you can make security you can make

1299
00:51:27,360 --> 00:51:29,190
experiments that span both engineering

1300
00:51:29,190 --> 00:51:32,310
and security you build programs where

1301
00:51:32,310 --> 00:51:33,870
they're kind of maybe they're manual a

1302
00:51:33,870 --> 00:51:36,450
popped out you try to create you know

1303
00:51:36,450 --> 00:51:37,980
valuable learning out of these these

1304
00:51:37,980 --> 00:51:41,460
type of systems and you know ones to

1305
00:51:41,460 --> 00:51:44,280
look at our like chaos slinger which

1306
00:51:44,280 --> 00:51:46,140
came out a United Healthcare Group chap

1307
00:51:46,140 --> 00:51:48,750
is over it out of Netflix and then chaos

1308
00:51:48,750 --> 00:51:52,140
monkey also added Netflix okay so if

1309
00:51:52,140 --> 00:51:53,730
you're interested in either of these two

1310
00:51:53,730 --> 00:51:57,060
things resiliency or you know chaos

1311
00:51:57,060 --> 00:51:59,010
engineering resiliency or a deception

1312
00:51:59,010 --> 00:52:00,810
I've got some links for you here some

1313
00:52:00,810 --> 00:52:04,020
some YouTube talks the the one of the

1314
00:52:04,020 --> 00:52:05,100
very bottom herb tops

1315
00:52:05,100 --> 00:52:07,530
Todd stock he gave that over at last

1316
00:52:07,530 --> 00:52:09,330
calm down in Austin a couple years ago

1317
00:52:09,330 --> 00:52:12,210
it's a year and half ago it was great so

1318
00:52:12,210 --> 00:52:14,640
I checked that out Phillip maddoxes talk

1319
00:52:14,640 --> 00:52:17,910
he runs the honey pie project also some

1320
00:52:17,910 --> 00:52:20,010
excellent stuff there and then of course

1321
00:52:20,010 --> 00:52:22,440
Aaron Reinhard's talked over at RSA I

1322
00:52:22,440 --> 00:52:25,050
think is pretty helpful so I see this is

1323
00:52:25,050 --> 00:52:26,460
where we're growing I see a lot of like

1324
00:52:26,460 --> 00:52:28,590
growth in this part of the industry ok

1325
00:52:28,590 --> 00:52:31,110
we'll close it out with with with the

1326
00:52:31,110 --> 00:52:34,170
good one empathy so we believe that that

1327
00:52:34,170 --> 00:52:36,450
need to have empathy based teams and so

1328
00:52:36,450 --> 00:52:37,980
we can kind of go back to the well here

1329
00:52:37,980 --> 00:52:40,380
and and look at our dev psych ops deep

1330
00:52:40,380 --> 00:52:42,030
thoughts when I think of all the

1331
00:52:42,030 --> 00:52:44,610
arguments this is oh and I and I've had

1332
00:52:44,610 --> 00:52:46,950
I realized how silly most of them were

1333
00:52:46,950 --> 00:52:48,810
it makes me wonder why he wanted to

1334
00:52:48,810 --> 00:52:50,700
argue over such stupid things I think

1335
00:52:50,700 --> 00:52:53,670
I'll go ask him so there you go that's

1336
00:52:53,670 --> 00:52:56,490
that's about the comedy level here so

1337
00:52:56,490 --> 00:52:59,850
but but in reality we see that security

1338
00:52:59,850 --> 00:53:01,890
walked and say oh jeez those stupid

1339
00:53:01,890 --> 00:53:03,770
developers you know

1340
00:53:03,770 --> 00:53:06,530
then you'll have developers say oh you

1341
00:53:06,530 --> 00:53:07,910
you just want a machine that's powered

1342
00:53:07,910 --> 00:53:09,530
off and unplugged right like you're so

1343
00:53:09,530 --> 00:53:11,180
disconnected from the business that we

1344
00:53:11,180 --> 00:53:14,180
don't even know and I found this from

1345
00:53:14,180 --> 00:53:15,830
the survey it's a year-over-year finding

1346
00:53:15,830 --> 00:53:18,410
but developers really believe that

1347
00:53:18,410 --> 00:53:20,390
security is important but they just

1348
00:53:20,390 --> 00:53:21,920
continually feel that they don't have

1349
00:53:21,920 --> 00:53:25,040
enough time to spend on it so I think

1350
00:53:25,040 --> 00:53:26,720
that one of the things we can do in the

1351
00:53:26,720 --> 00:53:29,720
security world is to help not be a

1352
00:53:29,720 --> 00:53:31,460
blocker but to be an enabler help

1353
00:53:31,460 --> 00:53:33,830
developers move faster take part in all

1354
00:53:33,830 --> 00:53:35,120
these other things and then understand

1355
00:53:35,120 --> 00:53:37,430
where where developers are coming from

1356
00:53:37,430 --> 00:53:39,170
I think developers can do the same thing

1357
00:53:39,170 --> 00:53:41,660
for security trying to understand like

1358
00:53:41,660 --> 00:53:43,730
how to make help bring them along for

1359
00:53:43,730 --> 00:53:45,380
the ride for the process including the

1360
00:53:45,380 --> 00:53:47,690
auditors and try to build build these

1361
00:53:47,690 --> 00:53:49,460
bridges where they can where they can

1362
00:53:49,460 --> 00:53:52,850
work together so that's the that's the

1363
00:53:52,850 --> 00:53:56,120
measure dev psych ops format here and so

1364
00:53:56,120 --> 00:53:58,760
just really really appreciate you guys

1365
00:53:58,760 --> 00:54:00,710
having me here and taking the time for

1366
00:54:00,710 --> 00:54:04,910
it I'm open to any comments or changes

1367
00:54:04,910 --> 00:54:06,530
or thoughts on this if you have you know

1368
00:54:06,530 --> 00:54:08,810
you have a thought we'd like something I

1369
00:54:08,810 --> 00:54:11,120
don't have to hear that if you have any

1370
00:54:11,120 --> 00:54:12,920
any comments or whatever on the book you

1371
00:54:12,920 --> 00:54:14,960
can do that or if you're like oh those

1372
00:54:14,960 --> 00:54:16,310
slides had some references in them I'd

1373
00:54:16,310 --> 00:54:17,960
like to get them you can hit me at that

1374
00:54:17,960 --> 00:54:19,580
email or I think we'll post them in the

1375
00:54:19,580 --> 00:54:22,510
in the notes for this we're done here so

1376
00:54:22,510 --> 00:54:25,250
alright so Brian I think I can turn it

1377
00:54:25,250 --> 00:54:29,620
back over to you yes thanks it was nice

1378
00:54:29,620 --> 00:54:32,390
there's a well it's a small discussion

1379
00:54:32,390 --> 00:54:35,450
going on on the chat right now and it's

1380
00:54:35,450 --> 00:54:38,360
about cultural changes I mean you you

1381
00:54:38,360 --> 00:54:40,400
started something out like the story

1382
00:54:40,400 --> 00:54:46,250
team should write code right and but

1383
00:54:46,250 --> 00:54:48,320
well for my perspective I would say as a

1384
00:54:48,320 --> 00:54:49,820
developer that would be there would be a

1385
00:54:49,820 --> 00:54:52,280
major cultural change how what are your

1386
00:54:52,280 --> 00:54:54,140
thoughts on that because I think culture

1387
00:54:54,140 --> 00:54:55,880
changes are in the hardest thing ever

1388
00:54:55,880 --> 00:54:59,360
yeah yeah and I think that's I found

1389
00:54:59,360 --> 00:55:00,680
that that want to be really interesting

1390
00:55:00,680 --> 00:55:03,500
because I mentioned earlier when we when

1391
00:55:03,500 --> 00:55:04,940
I mentioned that like a lot of people

1392
00:55:04,940 --> 00:55:08,320
kind of especially like security people

1393
00:55:08,320 --> 00:55:11,420
game I got to two sets of sets of

1394
00:55:11,420 --> 00:55:14,390
answers on this so I'd say 80% of

1395
00:55:14,390 --> 00:55:17,560
security people that are at

1396
00:55:17,560 --> 00:55:19,990
that are kind of at like fast moving

1397
00:55:19,990 --> 00:55:23,140
companies kind of you know the the large

1398
00:55:23,140 --> 00:55:25,180
like tech companies there they're all on

1399
00:55:25,180 --> 00:55:26,590
board right there you don't you don't

1400
00:55:26,590 --> 00:55:28,990
have to convince any of them like it's

1401
00:55:28,990 --> 00:55:31,720
like when Netflix or somebody is hiring

1402
00:55:31,720 --> 00:55:33,430
a new security engineer it's like not

1403
00:55:33,430 --> 00:55:35,890
being able to code as they you will not

1404
00:55:35,890 --> 00:55:38,590
get hired there right it's it's pretty

1405
00:55:38,590 --> 00:55:41,440
standard so they've already gone through

1406
00:55:41,440 --> 00:55:43,930
the transformation I believe it's the

1407
00:55:43,930 --> 00:55:46,570
companies where security is sort of seen

1408
00:55:46,570 --> 00:55:50,200
as this external entity and and it sort

1409
00:55:50,200 --> 00:55:52,360
of dealt with that in that capacity

1410
00:55:52,360 --> 00:55:55,390
where they're not there they're still

1411
00:55:55,390 --> 00:55:56,830
kind of fighting this and I got this is

1412
00:55:56,830 --> 00:55:59,050
where I got some some feedback on

1413
00:55:59,050 --> 00:56:03,580
Twitter from folks where they were they

1414
00:56:03,580 --> 00:56:04,870
were saying well like you can't expect

1415
00:56:04,870 --> 00:56:06,580
everybody in security to code you can't

1416
00:56:06,580 --> 00:56:10,900
you can't do this and I you know I went

1417
00:56:10,900 --> 00:56:12,610
back and forth on that but I still won't

1418
00:56:12,610 --> 00:56:14,800
I still believe that it is true that

1419
00:56:14,800 --> 00:56:17,500
having people in your security group

1420
00:56:17,500 --> 00:56:19,660
take part in the process of coding is a

1421
00:56:19,660 --> 00:56:21,790
valuable thing this happened with

1422
00:56:21,790 --> 00:56:23,770
operations and I think we can look to

1423
00:56:23,770 --> 00:56:25,960
operations as sort of a template for how

1424
00:56:25,960 --> 00:56:27,940
to do this with security at the cultural

1425
00:56:27,940 --> 00:56:30,400
change here because you wouldn't go hire

1426
00:56:30,400 --> 00:56:32,470
an Operations person today who's like

1427
00:56:32,470 --> 00:56:35,020
yeah like I store my config on this wiki

1428
00:56:35,020 --> 00:56:37,540
you know and then I copy and paste that

1429
00:56:37,540 --> 00:56:40,000
over here into my thing and and I start

1430
00:56:40,000 --> 00:56:42,040
up all these instances by hand you think

1431
00:56:42,040 --> 00:56:43,800
that that doesn't exist anymore

1432
00:56:43,800 --> 00:56:47,800
that job title is gone right in most

1433
00:56:47,800 --> 00:56:51,250
organizations so I think we're gonna see

1434
00:56:51,250 --> 00:56:52,960
that same thing happen with security so

1435
00:56:52,960 --> 00:56:56,080
I believe that's true also a friend of

1436
00:56:56,080 --> 00:56:58,750
mine said hey well you know who's really

1437
00:56:58,750 --> 00:57:00,850
happy if security people don't learn how

1438
00:57:00,850 --> 00:57:02,980
to code I was like oh and they're

1439
00:57:02,980 --> 00:57:05,530
like oh hackers like cuz hackers they

1440
00:57:05,530 --> 00:57:08,470
not a good it's like it's it's it's it's

1441
00:57:08,470 --> 00:57:13,060
a very valid and fair point so another

1442
00:57:13,060 --> 00:57:15,610
question can you suggest any security

1443
00:57:15,610 --> 00:57:18,880
tools to apply to Dell apply place yeah

1444
00:57:18,880 --> 00:57:22,150
sure you can look at so there's a the in

1445
00:57:22,150 --> 00:57:24,580
that course that I mentioned on LinkedIn

1446
00:57:24,580 --> 00:57:25,870
learning I kind of like break through

1447
00:57:25,870 --> 00:57:27,820
those those pipelines and I have some

1448
00:57:27,820 --> 00:57:31,120
talks that I've given before I think

1449
00:57:31,120 --> 00:57:33,790
I'll try to find it in sanity in an RSA

1450
00:57:33,790 --> 00:57:35,710
or that gives an RSA talk that I did

1451
00:57:35,710 --> 00:57:37,810
last year but all that we can put in the

1452
00:57:37,810 --> 00:57:39,220
show notes but I break through that

1453
00:57:39,220 --> 00:57:41,200
pipeline and sort of mention these tools

1454
00:57:41,200 --> 00:57:43,090
but you can you can basically break down

1455
00:57:43,090 --> 00:57:46,150
from like linters or like you know

1456
00:57:46,150 --> 00:57:48,280
secret type stuff like you know get

1457
00:57:48,280 --> 00:57:50,950
hound and other types of pieces gauntlet

1458
00:57:50,950 --> 00:57:52,690
is a tool that that I help participate

1459
00:57:52,690 --> 00:57:54,390
with which kind of does more on the

1460
00:57:54,390 --> 00:57:56,830
putting attacking and scanning type

1461
00:57:56,830 --> 00:57:59,800
tools inside of your CI CD pipeline to

1462
00:57:59,800 --> 00:58:02,370
run those as your as your deploying

1463
00:58:02,370 --> 00:58:04,840
trying to think of some other others I

1464
00:58:04,840 --> 00:58:05,920
mean you know a lot of them kind of an

1465
00:58:05,920 --> 00:58:09,280
end up being language specific I think

1466
00:58:09,280 --> 00:58:10,930
you know using you know tools like sneak

1467
00:58:10,930 --> 00:58:12,760
is a really great option I always

1468
00:58:12,760 --> 00:58:15,460
recommend that to folks so not to sell

1469
00:58:15,460 --> 00:58:18,070
sneak on the podcast but around the

1470
00:58:18,070 --> 00:58:20,490
webinar but I had you think that's good

1471
00:58:20,490 --> 00:58:23,650
you know using a rasp type tool so some

1472
00:58:23,650 --> 00:58:25,570
of those and that's on the far other end

1473
00:58:25,570 --> 00:58:28,150
like on the runtime side so I used to

1474
00:58:28,150 --> 00:58:29,620
work over at signal Sciences they have a

1475
00:58:29,620 --> 00:58:32,050
good product contrast security is a good

1476
00:58:32,050 --> 00:58:34,180
product so there's some options for you

1477
00:58:34,180 --> 00:58:38,380
to pull those in so you know I kind of

1478
00:58:38,380 --> 00:58:41,040
recommend to people take your pipeline

1479
00:58:41,040 --> 00:58:44,110
write out all the steps look understand

1480
00:58:44,110 --> 00:58:46,090
all the stages and then figure out where

1481
00:58:46,090 --> 00:58:47,530
can you start applying some security

1482
00:58:47,530 --> 00:58:50,290
testing and like your easiest and

1483
00:58:50,290 --> 00:58:52,090
cheapest stuff are like language linters

1484
00:58:52,090 --> 00:58:55,150
and security checks at that end you know

1485
00:58:55,150 --> 00:58:57,370
any dependencies like entity type type

1486
00:58:57,370 --> 00:59:00,760
stuff that you all do and then and then

1487
00:59:00,760 --> 00:59:02,170
kind of move forward then kind of add in

1488
00:59:02,170 --> 00:59:04,480
like the synthetic testing type tooling

1489
00:59:04,480 --> 00:59:06,190
inside of your you know whatever you're

1490
00:59:06,190 --> 00:59:08,110
deploying to stage or QA that's where

1491
00:59:08,110 --> 00:59:09,820
like a gauntlet or or other types of

1492
00:59:09,820 --> 00:59:12,820
those type of tools fit all right cool

1493
00:59:12,820 --> 00:59:13,980
thank you

1494
00:59:13,980 --> 00:59:15,970
that wasn't it was a question that the

1495
00:59:15,970 --> 00:59:18,070
slides will be shared I can't say that

1496
00:59:18,070 --> 00:59:20,620
we will say we will share the slides

1497
00:59:20,620 --> 00:59:22,750
with the video as one of the footnotes

1498
00:59:22,750 --> 00:59:25,210
in it so yes the slides will be shared

1499
00:59:25,210 --> 00:59:27,940
of course thank you all right cool

1500
00:59:27,940 --> 00:59:32,410
