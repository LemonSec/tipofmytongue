know in-person events it's a little bit

81
00:02:26,080 --> 00:02:27,599
harder to have like child care centers

82
00:02:27,599 --> 00:02:29,200
but there's so many cool things online

83

a champions program so how would how

171
00:05:11,440 --> 00:05:12,000
would you

172
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:15,280
create one um how would you put things

173
00:05:15,280 --> 00:05:16,800
in place to make it run

174
00:05:16,800 --> 00:05:19,280
uh monthly or or whatever whatever that

175
00:05:19,280 --> 00:05:20,560
looks like

176
00:05:20,560 --> 00:05:22,639
how you actually roll out and expand

177
00:05:22,639 --> 00:05:25,280
those that security champion program so

178
00:05:25,280 --> 00:05:27,039
how you roll it out in terms of maybe

179
00:05:27,039 --> 00:05:28,639
introducing it to a couple of teams

180
00:05:28,639 --> 00:05:29,360
first and then

181
00:05:29,360 --> 00:05:30,639
and then trying to expand that across

182
00:05:30,639 --> 00:05:32,800
your organization

183
00:05:32,800 --> 00:05:35,039
uh and then a couple of other things how

184
00:05:35,039 --> 00:05:36,560
you actually run that how you what you

185
00:05:36,560 --> 00:05:38,080
do day to day uh

186
00:05:38,080 --> 00:05:39,759
what are security what the activities in

187
00:05:39,759 --> 00:05:41,919
a security program and what you

188
00:05:41,919 --> 00:05:44,960
uh as a potential admin or champion

189
00:05:44,960 --> 00:05:46,880
need to do to make that uh to make that

190
00:05:46,880 --> 00:05:48,240
work going forward

191
00:05:48,240 --> 00:05:50,400
and then finally what does it actually

192
00:05:50,400 --> 00:05:52,560
look like when we see a good security

193
00:05:52,560 --> 00:05:54,320
champions program how do we know

194
00:05:54,320 --> 00:05:56,240
how well we're working what should the

195
00:05:56,240 --> 00:05:58,560
kpis be should we have kpis

196
00:05:58,560 --> 00:06:00,960
um a whole ton of questions about what

197
00:06:00,960 --> 00:06:01,919
success

198
00:06:01,919 --> 00:06:05,120
what good effectively looks like so

199
00:06:05,120 --> 00:06:06,720
um that's the that's what we're going to

200
00:06:06,720 --> 00:06:08,720
be covering today um and again

201
00:06:08,720 --> 00:06:11,039
i'd love to hear your opinions how your

202
00:06:11,039 --> 00:06:12,880
security champions program work

203
00:06:12,880 --> 00:06:14,800
uh what are the success areas that

204
00:06:14,800 --> 00:06:16,720
you're seeing what are the pitfalls

205
00:06:16,720 --> 00:06:19,919
um that you fall into uh this is

206
00:06:19,919 --> 00:06:21,199
absolutely one of the things that we

207
00:06:21,199 --> 00:06:22,960
want to do as a part of the community in

208
00:06:22,960 --> 00:06:23,919
terms of just you know

209
00:06:23,919 --> 00:06:27,680
share our experiences so um

210
00:06:27,680 --> 00:06:29,520
first of all what is a security

211
00:06:29,520 --> 00:06:30,960
champions program and my

212
00:06:30,960 --> 00:06:32,880
why might you want to run one maybe you

213
00:06:32,880 --> 00:06:34,479
maybe this isn't something for you but

214
00:06:34,479 --> 00:06:34,800
the

215
00:06:34,800 --> 00:06:36,960
big question is when you want a

216
00:06:36,960 --> 00:06:39,039
suggested security champions program

217
00:06:39,039 --> 00:06:40,880
it's very important to be able to say

218
00:06:40,880 --> 00:06:43,039
what it is and why you need it because

219
00:06:43,039 --> 00:06:45,680
you know this is an investment of your

220
00:06:45,680 --> 00:06:46,240
time

221
00:06:46,240 --> 00:06:48,160
of of everyone's time in fact

222
00:06:48,160 --> 00:06:50,000
development and security just important

223
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:52,479
to be clear about what that is

224
00:06:52,479 --> 00:06:55,039
typically from the people that i discuss

225
00:06:55,039 --> 00:06:57,599
this with and that varies from

226
00:06:57,599 --> 00:06:59,599
a number of startups small to medium

227
00:06:59,599 --> 00:07:01,680
businesses a number of um

228
00:07:01,680 --> 00:07:04,160
very very large organizations that have

229
00:07:04,160 --> 00:07:05,919
not even hundreds but thousands of

230
00:07:05,919 --> 00:07:07,759
security champions as part of it

231
00:07:07,759 --> 00:07:10,400
that have teams of admins running these

232
00:07:10,400 --> 00:07:11,199
i asked this

233
00:07:11,199 --> 00:07:13,680
same question to all of those all of

234
00:07:13,680 --> 00:07:15,120
those groups and

235
00:07:15,120 --> 00:07:18,080
largely it was a program that was used

236
00:07:18,080 --> 00:07:20,479
as a mechanism an effective mechanism

237
00:07:20,479 --> 00:07:21,840
for communication

238
00:07:21,840 --> 00:07:24,160
knowledge sharing and collaboration

239
00:07:24,160 --> 00:07:25,039
between

240
00:07:25,039 --> 00:07:26,639
both the security team and the

241
00:07:26,639 --> 00:07:28,720
engineering team the development teams

242
00:07:28,720 --> 00:07:32,400
so this is really one of the core pieces

243
00:07:32,400 --> 00:07:34,240
of what devsecops tries to

244
00:07:34,240 --> 00:07:36,560
break down which is the silos and trying

245
00:07:36,560 --> 00:07:37,440
to make sure

246
00:07:37,440 --> 00:07:40,479
that teams are working as one to a

247
00:07:40,479 --> 00:07:41,440
common goal

248
00:07:41,440 --> 00:07:42,960
so this is one this is one of the core

249
00:07:42,960 --> 00:07:44,800
areas which security champions

250
00:07:44,800 --> 00:07:46,560
can help you to that goal but it's

251
00:07:46,560 --> 00:07:48,479
important to not

252
00:07:48,479 --> 00:07:49,840
choose to do a security champions

253
00:07:49,840 --> 00:07:51,520
program because you want one and

254
00:07:51,520 --> 00:07:52,479
everyone else's

255
00:07:52,479 --> 00:07:55,120
has got one but it's important to do one

256
00:07:55,120 --> 00:07:57,039
to fix a goal what is your pain point

257
00:07:57,039 --> 00:07:58,720
that you're trying to that you're trying

258
00:07:58,720 --> 00:08:00,879
to fix and how can a security champions

259
00:08:00,879 --> 00:08:01,759
programs

260
00:08:01,759 --> 00:08:04,960
um help you do that and

261
00:08:04,960 --> 00:08:07,199
you are going to have different goals to

262
00:08:07,199 --> 00:08:08,160
every other

263
00:08:08,160 --> 00:08:09,919
organization out there that runs a

264
00:08:09,919 --> 00:08:11,440
security champions program

265
00:08:11,440 --> 00:08:14,080
it's important that when you create a

266
00:08:14,080 --> 00:08:14,720
program

267
00:08:14,720 --> 00:08:17,039
it's fixing your goals not the goals of

268
00:08:17,039 --> 00:08:18,879
what other people are doing so be sure

269
00:08:18,879 --> 00:08:19,440
that

270
00:08:19,440 --> 00:08:22,560
you're focusing and and really um

271
00:08:22,560 --> 00:08:24,479
being clear about what your security

272
00:08:24,479 --> 00:08:25,919
champions program is trying to fix in

273
00:08:25,919 --> 00:08:27,120
europe

274
00:08:27,120 --> 00:08:29,680
so how do we know that how do we know

275
00:08:29,680 --> 00:08:31,759
what are the specific challenges

276
00:08:31,759 --> 00:08:34,320
to our organization well when we think

277
00:08:34,320 --> 00:08:36,320
about a security champions program it's

278
00:08:36,320 --> 00:08:37,519
got security

279
00:08:37,519 --> 00:08:39,919
in it but we need to understand that

280
00:08:39,919 --> 00:08:42,320
while some of the goals here

281
00:08:42,320 --> 00:08:46,000
are targeting um or at least

282
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:48,640
helping the security team maybe get

283
00:08:48,640 --> 00:08:50,880
visibility and all those kind of things

284
00:08:50,880 --> 00:08:53,120
we need to understand that we should

285
00:08:53,120 --> 00:08:54,640
focus on the pain points of our

286
00:08:54,640 --> 00:08:55,839
developers

287
00:08:55,839 --> 00:08:58,240
right because a security champion is we

288
00:08:58,240 --> 00:08:59,120
will talk

289
00:08:59,120 --> 00:09:01,440
about going forward the actual role of a

290
00:09:01,440 --> 00:09:03,360
security champion is an individual

291
00:09:03,360 --> 00:09:06,480
that exists in an engineering team and

292
00:09:06,480 --> 00:09:08,560
one of the things that we need to do is

293
00:09:08,560 --> 00:09:10,240
get them on board get them

294
00:09:10,240 --> 00:09:13,040
involved the only way you can do that is

295
00:09:13,040 --> 00:09:13,360
to

296
00:09:13,360 --> 00:09:16,320
provide value to them and the value to a

297
00:09:16,320 --> 00:09:17,600
developer there is

298
00:09:17,600 --> 00:09:20,480
fixing a developer pain right so when we

299
00:09:20,480 --> 00:09:21,360
think about

300
00:09:21,360 --> 00:09:24,000
why what the goals are why might you

301
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:24,959
want to run one

302
00:09:24,959 --> 00:09:26,959
think about it from the developer angle

303
00:09:26,959 --> 00:09:28,320
and this is

304
00:09:28,320 --> 00:09:30,080
clear for me obviously as a developer of

305
00:09:30,080 --> 00:09:31,680
20 years uh

306
00:09:31,680 --> 00:09:33,519
rather than you know someone who's grown

307
00:09:33,519 --> 00:09:35,680
through the security organization

308
00:09:35,680 --> 00:09:37,760
but for a lot of security teams they

309
00:09:37,760 --> 00:09:39,680
create these programs

310
00:09:39,680 --> 00:09:41,920
so focused on getting visibility into

311
00:09:41,920 --> 00:09:43,519
the development organizations they don't

312
00:09:43,519 --> 00:09:44,399
think about it from

313
00:09:44,399 --> 00:09:46,000
enough from the developer from the

314
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:47,680
developer viewpoint

315
00:09:47,680 --> 00:09:50,640
so prioritize you obviously have to

316
00:09:50,640 --> 00:09:51,120
secure

317
00:09:51,120 --> 00:09:53,120
you obviously have to design the program

318
00:09:53,120 --> 00:09:54,480
and run the program

319
00:09:54,480 --> 00:09:56,240
from within the security organization

320
00:09:56,240 --> 00:09:59,440
but prioritize your developer

321
00:09:59,440 --> 00:10:01,519
goals prioritize your developer value

322
00:10:01,519 --> 00:10:03,279
when you create the program

323
00:10:03,279 --> 00:10:05,519
so how do we do that well do we guess do

324
00:10:05,519 --> 00:10:07,040
we try and understand

325
00:10:07,040 --> 00:10:08,720
we have to just go out and talk to our

326
00:10:08,720 --> 00:10:10,240
development teams talk to our

327
00:10:10,240 --> 00:10:11,519
organizations

328
00:10:11,519 --> 00:10:13,680
ask them what do you want from the

329
00:10:13,680 --> 00:10:15,600
program where do you need help

330
00:10:15,600 --> 00:10:18,240
what are you struggling with day to um

331
00:10:18,240 --> 00:10:20,480
try to work out how if you could do one

332
00:10:20,480 --> 00:10:22,000
thing in their in their

333
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:25,040
in their role where can we add value

334
00:10:25,040 --> 00:10:27,440
where can we make your lives easier and

335
00:10:27,440 --> 00:10:29,440
how can we help you to achieve the goals

336
00:10:29,440 --> 00:10:30,399
that you're trying to

337
00:10:30,399 --> 00:10:33,040
solve those are the things that need to

338
00:10:33,040 --> 00:10:33,920
be

339
00:10:33,920 --> 00:10:35,920
fitted into your security program and at

340
00:10:35,920 --> 00:10:38,560
the core of your security program

341
00:10:38,560 --> 00:10:42,160
so that it's a reason why those

342
00:10:42,160 --> 00:10:46,399
developers will join that program so

343
00:10:46,399 --> 00:10:47,600
let's make a quick distinction here

344
00:10:47,600 --> 00:10:48,880
we've talked we've talked a little bit

345
00:10:48,880 --> 00:10:50,800
about some of the reasons as to why

346
00:10:50,800 --> 00:10:54,399
how you go about providing some of the

347
00:10:54,399 --> 00:10:56,240
goals of your security program and what

348
00:10:56,240 --> 00:10:58,240
the security program is there to

349
00:10:58,240 --> 00:11:01,040
is there to do let's also take a step

350
00:11:01,040 --> 00:11:01,680
back and

351
00:11:01,680 --> 00:11:03,839
make a distinction between a security

352
00:11:03,839 --> 00:11:05,040
champions program

353
00:11:05,040 --> 00:11:08,240
and a security community so a security

354
00:11:08,240 --> 00:11:09,519
community

355
00:11:09,519 --> 00:11:12,959
is a less structured place for people

356
00:11:12,959 --> 00:11:14,480
who are security

357
00:11:14,480 --> 00:11:17,600
security um curious to

358
00:11:17,600 --> 00:11:20,480
join meet up and exist in their

359
00:11:20,480 --> 00:11:21,040
community

360
00:11:21,040 --> 00:11:22,800
like-minded people birds of a feather

361
00:11:22,800 --> 00:11:25,680
style and talk about stuff share stuff

362
00:11:25,680 --> 00:11:28,800
chat share knowledge maybe it by

363
00:11:28,800 --> 00:11:29,920
contrast

364
00:11:29,920 --> 00:11:33,200
a security champions program is um

365
00:11:33,200 --> 00:11:35,200
something that is structured through

366
00:11:35,200 --> 00:11:36,399
your organization

367
00:11:36,399 --> 00:11:39,200
it's an approved program and it's a way

368
00:11:39,200 --> 00:11:40,320
of scaling

369
00:11:40,320 --> 00:11:42,800
your security best practices throughout

370
00:11:42,800 --> 00:11:44,320
your organization

371
00:11:44,320 --> 00:11:46,800
to provide secure development through

372
00:11:46,800 --> 00:11:48,000
your organization through your

373
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:49,200
engineering teams

374
00:11:49,200 --> 00:11:52,240
so one is a much more um

375
00:11:52,240 --> 00:11:53,920
[Music]

376
00:11:53,920 --> 00:11:57,440
focused approved goal-driven

377
00:11:57,440 --> 00:11:59,279
program whereas the other one is a

378
00:11:59,279 --> 00:12:01,519
community just about

379
00:12:01,519 --> 00:12:03,360
you know pulling people who are each

380
00:12:03,360 --> 00:12:04,720
security conscious together

381
00:12:04,720 --> 00:12:07,920
to learn to grow themselves etc

382
00:12:07,920 --> 00:12:10,160
i'd love to hear for those of you from

383
00:12:10,160 --> 00:12:11,200
those of you who are

384
00:12:11,200 --> 00:12:13,680
have security champions programs today

385
00:12:13,680 --> 00:12:14,639
uh in the chat

386
00:12:14,639 --> 00:12:16,959
i'd love to hear what your goals are um

387
00:12:16,959 --> 00:12:18,800
for your security programs is it

388
00:12:18,800 --> 00:12:21,360
is there one goal is there multiple

389
00:12:21,360 --> 00:12:22,079
goals

390
00:12:22,079 --> 00:12:24,320
um what was it that caught that for

391
00:12:24,320 --> 00:12:25,120
those of you who

392
00:12:25,120 --> 00:12:28,399
are uh creating uh or created a program

393
00:12:28,399 --> 00:12:29,839
what was it that caused you

394
00:12:29,839 --> 00:12:31,279
to say i want to create a program

395
00:12:31,279 --> 00:12:32,720
because of this and likewise for those

396
00:12:32,720 --> 00:12:34,880
of you who are creating a program

397
00:12:34,880 --> 00:12:36,959
what is it that what is the pain point

398
00:12:36,959 --> 00:12:38,320
that is causing you to

399
00:12:38,320 --> 00:12:39,839
to create that program i'd love to i'd

400
00:12:39,839 --> 00:12:43,040
love to hear from you in the chat

401
00:12:43,040 --> 00:12:47,040
okay so next up why do your teams

402
00:12:47,040 --> 00:12:49,760
want a uh security champions program and

403
00:12:49,760 --> 00:12:50,959
we covered this a little bit in the

404
00:12:50,959 --> 00:12:51,519
previous

405
00:12:51,519 --> 00:12:55,120
in the previous slide but

406
00:12:55,120 --> 00:12:56,560
realistically different teams are going

407
00:12:56,560 --> 00:12:58,880
to have different motivations and this

408
00:12:58,880 --> 00:13:01,040
could actually be

409
00:13:01,040 --> 00:13:02,800
different from team to team you're going

410
00:13:02,800 --> 00:13:04,480
to have potentially different

411
00:13:04,480 --> 00:13:06,240
development teams each with

412
00:13:06,240 --> 00:13:08,320
uh different goals each with different

413
00:13:08,320 --> 00:13:09,839
security maturities

414
00:13:09,839 --> 00:13:11,760
uh some finding certain things easy

415
00:13:11,760 --> 00:13:13,040
while others you know

416
00:13:13,040 --> 00:13:15,120
potentially being a little bit slower on

417
00:13:15,120 --> 00:13:17,760
security testing security education

418
00:13:17,760 --> 00:13:20,399
understanding threat modeling etc people

419
00:13:20,399 --> 00:13:22,560
needing different levels of support and

420
00:13:22,560 --> 00:13:25,519
wanting to achieve different things so

421
00:13:25,519 --> 00:13:26,160
um

422
00:13:26,160 --> 00:13:29,920
one of the core reasons

423
00:13:29,920 --> 00:13:32,959
as to why teams do want a security

424
00:13:32,959 --> 00:13:36,160
champion is first of all to have a focal

425
00:13:36,160 --> 00:13:37,519
point and this is good actually both

426
00:13:37,519 --> 00:13:38,800
from a development point of view and a

427
00:13:38,800 --> 00:13:40,240
security point of view but to have a

428
00:13:40,240 --> 00:13:42,320
focal point in that development team

429
00:13:42,320 --> 00:13:44,240
um and this could be anything from

430
00:13:44,240 --> 00:13:45,920
training education

431
00:13:45,920 --> 00:13:49,760
um but ultimately it allows the team

432
00:13:49,760 --> 00:13:53,360
to be more self-autonomous um

433
00:13:53,360 --> 00:13:55,120
having that autonomy is really really

434
00:13:55,120 --> 00:13:57,279
important to to

435
00:13:57,279 --> 00:14:00,720
grow into a mature devsecops team

436
00:14:00,720 --> 00:14:02,959
and having a developer inside the

437
00:14:02,959 --> 00:14:04,000
engineering team

438
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:07,040
who understands good secure development

439
00:14:07,040 --> 00:14:10,320
practices who is very well connected

440
00:14:10,320 --> 00:14:11,600
into the security team

441
00:14:11,600 --> 00:14:13,360
so that any questions the development

442
00:14:13,360 --> 00:14:14,720
the the um

443
00:14:14,720 --> 00:14:16,800
any questions that the security team uh

444
00:14:16,800 --> 00:14:18,079
or development team

445
00:14:18,079 --> 00:14:20,800
have to ask they know who to go to uh if

446
00:14:20,800 --> 00:14:22,000
they have other routes

447
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:23,199
through to the development team or the

448
00:14:23,199 --> 00:14:25,440
security team that's fine as well

449
00:14:25,440 --> 00:14:27,760
but if they don't this is a great person

450
00:14:27,760 --> 00:14:29,600
to uh to reach out to now that one

451
00:14:29,600 --> 00:14:30,240
person

452
00:14:30,240 --> 00:14:31,600
doesn't have to necessarily fix all

453
00:14:31,600 --> 00:14:33,360
problems etc but they

454
00:14:33,360 --> 00:14:35,600
will know who to go to to pass people on

455
00:14:35,600 --> 00:14:37,600
et cetera so that having a focal point

456
00:14:37,600 --> 00:14:40,800
uh is extremely important uh

457
00:14:40,800 --> 00:14:43,839
one other really good reason why uh

458
00:14:43,839 --> 00:14:46,240
teams want a security champions program

459
00:14:46,240 --> 00:14:48,959
is to really amplify this is very much

460
00:14:48,959 --> 00:14:50,720
more of a security team pushing this

461
00:14:50,720 --> 00:14:53,279
to amplify that security expertise

462
00:14:53,279 --> 00:14:55,120
throughout the organization

463
00:14:55,120 --> 00:14:58,800
and this can come quite easily through

464
00:14:58,800 --> 00:15:00,800
when security champions come together

465
00:15:00,800 --> 00:15:02,800
and they can be educated as a team

466
00:15:02,800 --> 00:15:05,120
perhaps by the security team or by an

467
00:15:05,120 --> 00:15:06,480
external organization

468
00:15:06,480 --> 00:15:09,279
but really being able to amplify that

469
00:15:09,279 --> 00:15:11,279
without the security team needing to go

470
00:15:11,279 --> 00:15:14,399
into every single group to do that

471
00:15:14,399 --> 00:15:17,279
some developers might want to be the

472
00:15:17,279 --> 00:15:18,320
security champion

473
00:15:18,320 --> 00:15:20,320
to improve oneself some people who are

474
00:15:20,320 --> 00:15:21,839
naturally security curious

475
00:15:21,839 --> 00:15:23,199
and i've seen many many people who

476
00:15:23,199 --> 00:15:25,519
actually move into security champions

477
00:15:25,519 --> 00:15:28,320
team or program first before making the

478
00:15:28,320 --> 00:15:30,800
jump into a security team in fact

479
00:15:30,800 --> 00:15:33,839
one of our folks from sneak in our

480
00:15:33,839 --> 00:15:35,440
security team today

481
00:15:35,440 --> 00:15:38,240
was a previous engineer who was very

482
00:15:38,240 --> 00:15:39,360
keen on security

483
00:15:39,360 --> 00:15:42,959
moved into a security champions

484
00:15:42,959 --> 00:15:45,839
role and then from there they moved to

485
00:15:45,839 --> 00:15:46,160
uh

486
00:15:46,160 --> 00:15:49,519
to being a security engineer

487
00:15:49,759 --> 00:15:53,120
to increase that security influence

488
00:15:53,120 --> 00:15:54,320
earlier in the life cycle

489
00:15:54,320 --> 00:15:57,759
right as well when you have this

490
00:15:57,759 --> 00:15:59,600
siloed experience where security and

491
00:15:59,600 --> 00:16:02,320
developers are very much separated

492
00:16:02,320 --> 00:16:05,199
um the security team tend to get

493
00:16:05,199 --> 00:16:06,880
involved at very specific points of an

494
00:16:06,880 --> 00:16:08,000
application lifecycle

495
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:11,040
and by having an individual who

496
00:16:11,040 --> 00:16:14,399
has that focus of security they are much

497
00:16:14,399 --> 00:16:16,320
much closer to every part of that

498
00:16:16,320 --> 00:16:17,040
lifecycle

499
00:16:17,040 --> 00:16:18,959
and very early on even during the design

500
00:16:18,959 --> 00:16:20,399
phase when people should be talking

501
00:16:20,399 --> 00:16:21,600
about threat modeling

502
00:16:21,600 --> 00:16:24,800
even during a pull request review when

503
00:16:24,800 --> 00:16:26,160
people should be thinking about

504
00:16:26,160 --> 00:16:28,959
security code reviews at every stage we

505
00:16:28,959 --> 00:16:30,720
have an individual in the team with that

506
00:16:30,720 --> 00:16:31,360
focus

507
00:16:31,360 --> 00:16:34,399
that can identify that can ask the

508
00:16:34,399 --> 00:16:34,880
question

509
00:16:34,880 --> 00:16:37,759
or identify issues at the right time as

510
00:16:37,759 --> 00:16:38,720
early as possible

511
00:16:38,720 --> 00:16:41,279
and start that discussion um again they

512
00:16:41,279 --> 00:16:42,639
don't need to fix things they just need

513
00:16:42,639 --> 00:16:44,320
to ask that question at the right time

514
00:16:44,320 --> 00:16:47,360
so um these are these are the important

515
00:16:47,360 --> 00:16:50,480
the important pieces but ultimately you

516
00:16:50,480 --> 00:16:51,040
want

517
00:16:51,040 --> 00:16:53,120
teams to want a security champion's

518
00:16:53,120 --> 00:16:55,759
program because it makes their life

519
00:16:55,759 --> 00:16:57,519
easier and that is something that it

520
00:16:57,519 --> 00:16:59,279
doesn't matter if you're a developer

521
00:16:59,279 --> 00:17:01,519
or a security person the security

522
00:17:01,519 --> 00:17:02,800
champions program

523
00:17:02,800 --> 00:17:05,119
has to make your life easier has to

524
00:17:05,119 --> 00:17:06,959
provide value to you

525
00:17:06,959 --> 00:17:09,280
uh if you're not doing that then it's a

526
00:17:09,280 --> 00:17:10,640
one-way program

527
00:17:10,640 --> 00:17:14,400
that that has a likelihood of failing

528
00:17:16,839 --> 00:17:18,079
okay

529
00:17:18,079 --> 00:17:20,799
let's start at the start then or close

530
00:17:20,799 --> 00:17:22,079
to the start

531
00:17:22,079 --> 00:17:25,679
um when we think about creating a

532
00:17:25,679 --> 00:17:29,200
uh a security champion program

533
00:17:29,200 --> 00:17:32,640
what support do we need in order to

534
00:17:32,640 --> 00:17:36,240
run a program like this um i talked to

535
00:17:36,240 --> 00:17:38,880
a number of organizations that didn't

536
00:17:38,880 --> 00:17:39,520
have

537
00:17:39,520 --> 00:17:43,120
executive sponsorship and most of these

538
00:17:43,120 --> 00:17:46,799
failed typically through a number of

539
00:17:46,799 --> 00:17:47,840
different reasons

540
00:17:47,840 --> 00:17:50,960
some because it was extremely hard um

541
00:17:50,960 --> 00:17:53,600
for the developers to find the time if

542
00:17:53,600 --> 00:17:54,799
they're not

543
00:17:54,799 --> 00:17:57,760
given the time by the organization some

544
00:17:57,760 --> 00:17:59,120
uh where it could be

545
00:17:59,120 --> 00:18:02,559
just not seen as a program that is

546
00:18:02,559 --> 00:18:05,200
is good essential has value to the

547
00:18:05,200 --> 00:18:06,960
business if it's not officially

548
00:18:06,960 --> 00:18:10,480
seen as something that is worth doing

549
00:18:10,480 --> 00:18:12,799
some whereby if your developers for

550
00:18:12,799 --> 00:18:13,600
example

551
00:18:13,600 --> 00:18:16,160
need to do some security work as an

552
00:18:16,160 --> 00:18:18,720
aside or on top of their actual job

553
00:18:18,720 --> 00:18:20,240
people aren't then considering it as

554
00:18:20,240 --> 00:18:22,000
part of their job um

555
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:24,720
we need to add this in to the developer

556
00:18:24,720 --> 00:18:26,559
role in order for it to be so

557
00:18:26,559 --> 00:18:27,919
one of the biggest foils that you can

558
00:18:27,919 --> 00:18:30,160
avoid is to run a security champions

559
00:18:30,160 --> 00:18:30,960
program

560
00:18:30,960 --> 00:18:33,280
without the exact sponsorship without

561
00:18:33,280 --> 00:18:34,320
the support

562
00:18:34,320 --> 00:18:37,679
and this is needs to happen

563
00:18:37,679 --> 00:18:39,280
not just from the security organization

564
00:18:39,280 --> 00:18:42,640
but the development organization as well

565
00:18:42,640 --> 00:18:44,960
the support comes from the top down and

566
00:18:44,960 --> 00:18:45,840
you need

567
00:18:45,840 --> 00:18:47,520
some of the most senior people in the

568
00:18:47,520 --> 00:18:48,960
engineering and security organization

569
00:18:48,960 --> 00:18:51,039
whether that's csos whether that's vp

570
00:18:51,039 --> 00:18:54,320
svp of security or a vp of engineering

571
00:18:54,320 --> 00:18:55,600
or a cto

572
00:18:55,600 --> 00:18:58,320
you need these people to to voice that

573
00:18:58,320 --> 00:18:59,600
this is important

574
00:18:59,600 --> 00:19:03,440
uh you need these people to um push down

575
00:19:03,440 --> 00:19:05,360
in through the organization to the

576
00:19:05,360 --> 00:19:07,200
second line managers third line managers

577
00:19:07,200 --> 00:19:08,640
first line managers whatever level of

578
00:19:08,640 --> 00:19:10,320
the organization down to the scrum

579
00:19:10,320 --> 00:19:11,840
masters the team leads

580
00:19:11,840 --> 00:19:14,080
to say this is important you should be

581
00:19:14,080 --> 00:19:15,360
spending your time on this

582
00:19:15,360 --> 00:19:19,039
to say perhaps we are giving you

583
00:19:19,039 --> 00:19:23,280
10 20 of your of your week

584
00:19:23,280 --> 00:19:25,760
to spend on these security related

585
00:19:25,760 --> 00:19:26,400
matters

586
00:19:26,400 --> 00:19:28,880
okay it needs to be prioritized for it

587
00:19:28,880 --> 00:19:31,840
to work successfully

588
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:34,960
at this stage once you have that backing

589
00:19:34,960 --> 00:19:37,280
the it empowers the individuals in those

590
00:19:37,280 --> 00:19:39,039
teams both from the security side

591
00:19:39,039 --> 00:19:40,000
but more importantly from the

592
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:42,160
development organization to say i need

593
00:19:42,160 --> 00:19:42,640
to spend

594
00:19:42,640 --> 00:19:46,320
this amount of time in my my sprint or

595
00:19:46,320 --> 00:19:47,280
my

596
00:19:47,280 --> 00:19:50,480
week doing this security thing if i ask

597
00:19:50,480 --> 00:19:52,320
others in the development team

598
00:19:52,320 --> 00:19:55,760
to you know do some security testing to

599
00:19:55,760 --> 00:19:57,200
to do some threat modeling to do

600
00:19:57,200 --> 00:19:59,200
whatever it's looked upon as a

601
00:19:59,200 --> 00:20:00,960
as a thing that the business cares about

602
00:20:00,960 --> 00:20:04,559
because we have that expense sponsorship

603
00:20:04,559 --> 00:20:07,120
good question that came up was when you

604
00:20:07,120 --> 00:20:08,799
go for the exact sponsorship some people

605
00:20:08,799 --> 00:20:09,840
did this

606
00:20:09,840 --> 00:20:11,919
early on some people needed a little bit

607
00:20:11,919 --> 00:20:13,200
of time before they got that extra

608
00:20:13,200 --> 00:20:14,080
sponsorship

609
00:20:14,080 --> 00:20:17,520
and this tends to come from who um

610
00:20:17,520 --> 00:20:21,760
who are who the who is the main

611
00:20:21,760 --> 00:20:24,480
what is the main reason behind you you

612
00:20:24,480 --> 00:20:24,880
know

613
00:20:24,880 --> 00:20:27,280
building up these big security programs

614
00:20:27,280 --> 00:20:28,000
is it

615
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:30,480
because the execs are saying we need to

616
00:20:30,480 --> 00:20:31,600
increase uh

617
00:20:31,600 --> 00:20:34,320
our security is it coming one-sided

618
00:20:34,320 --> 00:20:35,919
maybe from the security team

619
00:20:35,919 --> 00:20:37,840
is it coming from the bottom up from

620
00:20:37,840 --> 00:20:39,840
either the engineers or the security

621
00:20:39,840 --> 00:20:42,640
practitioners depending on if it's

622
00:20:42,640 --> 00:20:43,200
coming

623
00:20:43,200 --> 00:20:46,159
from each one of those you might want to

624
00:20:46,159 --> 00:20:48,240
run the program a little bit first

625
00:20:48,240 --> 00:20:49,840
or just go straight to the execs and say

626
00:20:49,840 --> 00:20:51,840
this is what we need depending on

627
00:20:51,840 --> 00:20:53,520
depending on which way these pressures

628
00:20:53,520 --> 00:20:55,280
come from we'll determine that for you

629
00:20:55,280 --> 00:20:56,559
for your organizations

630
00:20:56,559 --> 00:20:59,039
and of course just to reiterate you know

631
00:20:59,039 --> 00:21:00,159
there are no

632
00:21:00,159 --> 00:21:02,400
best practices here where you get a

633
00:21:02,400 --> 00:21:04,400
quick cookie cutter and say yes this

634
00:21:04,400 --> 00:21:06,000
will work in my organization

635
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:07,840
it very much depends on the culture the

636
00:21:07,840 --> 00:21:09,679
individuals the internal politics at

637
00:21:09,679 --> 00:21:10,159
play

638
00:21:10,159 --> 00:21:12,720
uh your modern development practices or

639
00:21:12,720 --> 00:21:13,679
security

640
00:21:13,679 --> 00:21:17,280
um uh maturity in order to

641
00:21:17,280 --> 00:21:19,919
work out which of these um thoughts

642
00:21:19,919 --> 00:21:21,200
ideas

643
00:21:21,200 --> 00:21:22,559
pieces that you want to pull across to

644
00:21:22,559 --> 00:21:25,200
your organization or not

645
00:21:25,200 --> 00:21:28,320
um so yeah another way of doing this is

646
00:21:28,320 --> 00:21:30,400
to run the program for a little bit

647
00:21:30,400 --> 00:21:32,720
perhaps with a very very small rollout

648
00:21:32,720 --> 00:21:34,559
and then present that up to an exec team

649
00:21:34,559 --> 00:21:36,559
to say look at what we've achieved we

650
00:21:36,559 --> 00:21:38,159
want to scale this out across more of

651
00:21:38,159 --> 00:21:39,200
the organization

652
00:21:39,200 --> 00:21:41,039
then you start to get the backing there

653
00:21:41,039 --> 00:21:42,559
and then you push that down

654
00:21:42,559 --> 00:21:44,960
it's it's dangerous to take that too far

655
00:21:44,960 --> 00:21:46,400
without that backing though because

656
00:21:46,400 --> 00:21:47,039
again

657
00:21:47,039 --> 00:21:49,360
um you know you lose a lot of the a lot

658
00:21:49,360 --> 00:21:50,080
of the value

659
00:21:50,080 --> 00:21:51,760
without that top-down support i'd love

660
00:21:51,760 --> 00:21:54,240
to hear uh from you in the chat as well

661
00:21:54,240 --> 00:21:57,360
is this you know have you got executive

662
00:21:57,360 --> 00:21:58,320
sponsorship

663
00:21:58,320 --> 00:22:00,080
was that if you didn't have executive

664
00:22:00,080 --> 00:22:01,840
sponsorship um

665
00:22:01,840 --> 00:22:03,440
how much of a hindrance was that to your

666
00:22:03,440 --> 00:22:05,200
organization to your to your program

667
00:22:05,200 --> 00:22:06,240
that's a that's a

668
00:22:06,240 --> 00:22:09,919
core piece that we that we kicked off

669
00:22:10,320 --> 00:22:13,600
okay um so how should we structure the

670
00:22:13,600 --> 00:22:14,480
program and this is

671
00:22:14,480 --> 00:22:16,960
this is something which differs uh from

672
00:22:16,960 --> 00:22:18,240
program to program

673
00:22:18,240 --> 00:22:21,600
um and org to walk a good um security

674
00:22:21,600 --> 00:22:22,559
champion

675
00:22:22,559 --> 00:22:26,000
um is someone who tends to be

676
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:28,159
naturally uh invested in security

677
00:22:28,159 --> 00:22:30,240
naturally interested in security

678
00:22:30,240 --> 00:22:32,960
but ultimately a security champion is a

679
00:22:32,960 --> 00:22:34,159
day-to-day developer

680
00:22:34,159 --> 00:22:37,280
um they are an active contributor into

681
00:22:37,280 --> 00:22:40,080
an engineering team or a product team

682
00:22:40,080 --> 00:22:41,520
and

683
00:22:41,520 --> 00:22:43,919
typically that you will have one

684
00:22:43,919 --> 00:22:44,960
security champion

685
00:22:44,960 --> 00:22:48,240
per engineering team or

686
00:22:48,240 --> 00:22:52,000
um for a group of teams the

687
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:53,760
really depending on which one you choose

688
00:22:53,760 --> 00:22:55,520
you could even have

689
00:22:55,520 --> 00:22:58,559
um a number of security champions per

690
00:22:58,559 --> 00:22:59,520
team if you want

691
00:22:59,520 --> 00:23:01,280
but for clarity it's good to have a

692
00:23:01,280 --> 00:23:03,840
single point of contact

693
00:23:03,840 --> 00:23:05,840
if you want to avoid having a bottleneck

694
00:23:05,840 --> 00:23:07,120
of just one person

695
00:23:07,120 --> 00:23:09,600
you might want a you know a couple per

696
00:23:09,600 --> 00:23:13,280
team but it's good to have that clarity

697
00:23:13,280 --> 00:23:16,880
the discussion about whether

698
00:23:16,880 --> 00:23:18,480
your security champions should be

699
00:23:18,480 --> 00:23:20,320
voluntary or whether they should be

700
00:23:20,320 --> 00:23:22,080
picked by management

701
00:23:22,080 --> 00:23:24,799
across the board actually there were a

702
00:23:24,799 --> 00:23:25,760
number of mixed

703
00:23:25,760 --> 00:23:27,760
decisions here as to whether people

704
00:23:27,760 --> 00:23:29,200
should pick

705
00:23:29,200 --> 00:23:31,200
an individual or whether they should be

706
00:23:31,200 --> 00:23:32,960
voluntary or whether you should say

707
00:23:32,960 --> 00:23:35,919
i want one per team and it's up to your

708
00:23:35,919 --> 00:23:36,480
team

709
00:23:36,480 --> 00:23:39,679
to uh to to pick them um

710
00:23:39,679 --> 00:23:41,360
depends on really how fast the

711
00:23:41,360 --> 00:23:42,799
organization wants to create that

712
00:23:42,799 --> 00:23:44,400
security champions program

713
00:23:44,400 --> 00:23:46,159
and also how much coverage across their

714
00:23:46,159 --> 00:23:47,600
engineering teams they want

715
00:23:47,600 --> 00:23:51,360
but what we found is for the success

716
00:23:51,360 --> 00:23:53,600
of the individual security champions

717
00:23:53,600 --> 00:23:54,480
programs

718
00:23:54,480 --> 00:23:57,840
it it it looked and felt better

719
00:23:57,840 --> 00:24:00,559
when individual security champions were

720
00:24:00,559 --> 00:24:02,159
completely voluntary

721
00:24:02,159 --> 00:24:04,480
in their addition into that program so

722
00:24:04,480 --> 00:24:05,919
why because

723
00:24:05,919 --> 00:24:08,000
whenever when you get that individual

724
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:09,679
that is security curious

725
00:24:09,679 --> 00:24:11,360
they're all they are putting themselves

726
00:24:11,360 --> 00:24:13,120
forward to spend that time they're

727
00:24:13,120 --> 00:24:14,400
putting themselves forward

728
00:24:14,400 --> 00:24:16,000
because they have a genuine interest in

729
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:17,520
that if there is any

730
00:24:17,520 --> 00:24:20,640
other reason whether it's um

731
00:24:20,640 --> 00:24:22,799
you know someone man you know we need

732
00:24:22,799 --> 00:24:23,760
someone on this team

733
00:24:23,760 --> 00:24:25,120
oh let's let's put it let's give it to

734
00:24:25,120 --> 00:24:27,440
that person or a team has to pick

735
00:24:27,440 --> 00:24:28,880
they're not they're not always going to

736
00:24:28,880 --> 00:24:30,720
pick the best person maybe they'll

737
00:24:30,720 --> 00:24:32,000
end up picking someone who isn't

738
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:34,000
delivering as much and and that will

739
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:35,760
have less of an impact on their team for

740
00:24:35,760 --> 00:24:37,200
a number of reasons you can

741
00:24:37,200 --> 00:24:39,360
sometimes not get the right group of

742
00:24:39,360 --> 00:24:40,960
people and that can have a negative

743
00:24:40,960 --> 00:24:43,440
impact on that community

744
00:24:43,440 --> 00:24:46,559
so ideally that would be a

745
00:24:46,559 --> 00:24:49,600
voluntary position love to hear if if

746
00:24:49,600 --> 00:24:52,720
you uh have those similar uh

747
00:24:52,720 --> 00:24:54,400
voluntary requirements or whether

748
00:24:54,400 --> 00:24:57,039
there's you know actually a mandatory

749
00:24:57,039 --> 00:24:59,520
requirement people to have so yeah the

750
00:24:59,520 --> 00:25:00,640
reason why

751
00:25:00,640 --> 00:25:04,159
people do say you know what we want one

752
00:25:04,159 --> 00:25:05,919
person for every single engineering team

753
00:25:05,919 --> 00:25:08,240
is for that coverage across across their

754
00:25:08,240 --> 00:25:09,440
organization

755
00:25:09,440 --> 00:25:10,880
and that's an interesting way for a

756
00:25:10,880 --> 00:25:12,480
company to be able to get

757
00:25:12,480 --> 00:25:14,559
visibility but it's for the security

758
00:25:14,559 --> 00:25:16,159
team to get visibility

759
00:25:16,159 --> 00:25:18,240
into the security the risk overall

760
00:25:18,240 --> 00:25:20,240
across their organization

761
00:25:20,240 --> 00:25:22,400
a couple of ways in which or one way in

762
00:25:22,400 --> 00:25:23,600
which this was done

763
00:25:23,600 --> 00:25:26,240
fairly successfully with a very large

764
00:25:26,240 --> 00:25:28,400
organization was a mix of the two

765
00:25:28,400 --> 00:25:31,440
and this is where they required

766
00:25:31,440 --> 00:25:34,320
every single part of the organization to

767
00:25:34,320 --> 00:25:35,279
fill out these

768
00:25:35,279 --> 00:25:37,600
security scorecards so every engineering

769
00:25:37,600 --> 00:25:38,640
team had to do that

770
00:25:38,640 --> 00:25:40,960
and the best way of filling out that

771
00:25:40,960 --> 00:25:41,760
scorecard

772
00:25:41,760 --> 00:25:44,000
is to do it with the security team so

773
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:45,039
you provide

774
00:25:45,039 --> 00:25:47,039
this requirement for to have a scorecard

775
00:25:47,039 --> 00:25:48,400
so we can understand

776
00:25:48,400 --> 00:25:50,400
the security posture of every single

777
00:25:50,400 --> 00:25:52,640
team but if you do it with the security

778
00:25:52,640 --> 00:25:52,960
team

779
00:25:52,960 --> 00:25:54,159
and the way to do it with the security

780
00:25:54,159 --> 00:25:56,320
team is to have an individual that joins

781
00:25:56,320 --> 00:25:58,720
this program if you do with that team

782
00:25:58,720 --> 00:26:00,240
then it will actually be a lot easier to

783
00:26:00,240 --> 00:26:01,520
be able to fill that out

784
00:26:01,520 --> 00:26:03,600
and to work with them in terms of

785
00:26:03,600 --> 00:26:04,640
improvement and

786
00:26:04,640 --> 00:26:07,600
so that's a kind of like way of doing a

787
00:26:07,600 --> 00:26:08,960
little bit of both whereby it's not

788
00:26:08,960 --> 00:26:11,760
mandatory but it will help you a lot

789
00:26:11,760 --> 00:26:13,120
this kind of thing though requires the

790
00:26:13,120 --> 00:26:14,880
exec team to be able to say this is

791
00:26:14,880 --> 00:26:16,400
something that is very very important to

792
00:26:16,400 --> 00:26:17,760
us from a security point of view and as

793
00:26:17,760 --> 00:26:18,400
a result

794
00:26:18,400 --> 00:26:19,760
you know we're interested in these

795
00:26:19,760 --> 00:26:21,039
scorecards we're interested in knowing

796
00:26:21,039 --> 00:26:23,279
our security posture

797
00:26:23,279 --> 00:26:25,039
so that's the engineering team what

798
00:26:25,039 --> 00:26:26,320
about the security team

799
00:26:26,320 --> 00:26:28,240
well um from the security team you

800
00:26:28,240 --> 00:26:30,240
always you also have representation

801
00:26:30,240 --> 00:26:32,480
uh as part of a security mentor or a

802
00:26:32,480 --> 00:26:33,760
security coach

803
00:26:33,760 --> 00:26:37,120
um from the champions sometimes security

804
00:26:37,120 --> 00:26:38,320
champions are called

805
00:26:38,320 --> 00:26:39,520
champions sometimes they're called

806
00:26:39,520 --> 00:26:41,520
mavens doesn't really matter but um

807
00:26:41,520 --> 00:26:43,279
those are the two that typically use

808
00:26:43,279 --> 00:26:45,919
champions and coaches for the security

809
00:26:45,919 --> 00:26:47,200
coach on the security

810
00:26:47,200 --> 00:26:49,919
uh team side the security coach will

811
00:26:49,919 --> 00:26:51,039
tend to

812
00:26:51,039 --> 00:26:52,799
have a one-to-many relationship with a

813
00:26:52,799 --> 00:26:54,400
number of teams in the development

814
00:26:54,400 --> 00:26:55,520
organization

815
00:26:55,520 --> 00:26:58,240
and that develop that will typically be

816
00:26:58,240 --> 00:27:00,320
the part of the organization that they

817
00:27:00,320 --> 00:27:01,919
would have been responsible for even

818
00:27:01,919 --> 00:27:03,360
outside of the security champions

819
00:27:03,360 --> 00:27:04,080
program

820
00:27:04,080 --> 00:27:06,480
so if they are responsible for i don't

821
00:27:06,480 --> 00:27:08,000
know certain development teams certain

822
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:08,960
applications

823
00:27:08,960 --> 00:27:12,400
um certain business units those

824
00:27:12,400 --> 00:27:14,559
same business unit teams or or or

825
00:27:14,559 --> 00:27:15,600
organization teams

826
00:27:15,600 --> 00:27:18,840
they would still have uh that same

827
00:27:18,840 --> 00:27:20,799
representation

828
00:27:20,799 --> 00:27:24,000
um now the role of a security champion

829
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:26,399
isn't just to listen to the security

830
00:27:26,399 --> 00:27:27,039
team

831
00:27:27,039 --> 00:27:29,120
understand what needs to be done next

832
00:27:29,120 --> 00:27:30,399
and do it themselves

833
00:27:30,399 --> 00:27:33,919
sometimes depending on how the program

834
00:27:33,919 --> 00:27:34,880
is structured

835
00:27:34,880 --> 00:27:37,440
sometimes that's how it will turn out

836
00:27:37,440 --> 00:27:38,640
but a lot of the time

837
00:27:38,640 --> 00:27:40,000
it is the security champion's

838
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:42,080
responsibility to make sure

839
00:27:42,080 --> 00:27:43,840
that the next thing that they want to

840
00:27:43,840 --> 00:27:45,760
achieve in this uh

841
00:27:45,760 --> 00:27:47,279
in this in this team through with you

842
00:27:47,279 --> 00:27:48,720
know with the security uh flavor

843
00:27:48,720 --> 00:27:49,440
obviously

844
00:27:49,440 --> 00:27:53,039
um someone gets it done within a time

845
00:27:53,039 --> 00:27:53,760
frame

846
00:27:53,760 --> 00:27:55,279
perhaps they say i don't know we want to

847
00:27:55,279 --> 00:27:57,200
make sure that every single

848
00:27:57,200 --> 00:27:59,520
feature from this day onwards uh we do

849
00:27:59,520 --> 00:28:00,559
some threat modeling

850
00:28:00,559 --> 00:28:03,039
um analysis on every single feature how

851
00:28:03,039 --> 00:28:03,919
do we do that well

852
00:28:03,919 --> 00:28:06,240
first of all we need to understand what

853
00:28:06,240 --> 00:28:07,360
uh what how

854
00:28:07,360 --> 00:28:09,279
we structure threat modeling discussions

855
00:28:09,279 --> 00:28:10,799
we need to do some education with the

856
00:28:10,799 --> 00:28:11,360
team

857
00:28:11,360 --> 00:28:14,640
maybe we need a security individual as

858
00:28:14,640 --> 00:28:16,640
part of that threat modeling

859
00:28:16,640 --> 00:28:18,559
discussion and we make sure we integrate

860
00:28:18,559 --> 00:28:20,480
that with the process

861
00:28:20,480 --> 00:28:23,360
um these are the kind of things which

862
00:28:23,360 --> 00:28:24,640
you know a

863
00:28:24,640 --> 00:28:26,480
security champion will pull the right

864
00:28:26,480 --> 00:28:28,640
people in rather than necessarily do it

865
00:28:28,640 --> 00:28:30,720
all themselves

866
00:28:30,720 --> 00:28:33,520
so the most important thing here however

867
00:28:33,520 --> 00:28:34,320
you structure

868
00:28:34,320 --> 00:28:37,440
this is clarity to be able to say

869
00:28:37,440 --> 00:28:39,520
this is the role this is what we need

870
00:28:39,520 --> 00:28:41,520
you to do this is how long it should

871
00:28:41,520 --> 00:28:42,080
take

872
00:28:42,080 --> 00:28:44,159
and this is how much time you know you

873
00:28:44,159 --> 00:28:46,159
are you are being provided by your

874
00:28:46,159 --> 00:28:48,320
exec team by your organization to

875
00:28:48,320 --> 00:28:49,520
achieve this

876
00:28:49,520 --> 00:28:51,600
to provide that clarity and to make it

877
00:28:51,600 --> 00:28:52,799
crystal clear

878
00:28:52,799 --> 00:28:54,480
from the organization is what you need

879
00:28:54,480 --> 00:28:56,080
to do um is

880
00:28:56,080 --> 00:28:57,600
is one of the most important things that

881
00:28:57,600 --> 00:28:59,279
you could that you should be thinking

882
00:28:59,279 --> 00:29:00,000
about so that

883
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:02,240
when the developers see a security

884
00:29:02,240 --> 00:29:03,840
champion they know straight away

885
00:29:03,840 --> 00:29:07,600
what it is and what those individuals do

886
00:29:07,600 --> 00:29:10,640
um one of the

887
00:29:10,640 --> 00:29:13,520
ways in which we can pull together

888
00:29:13,520 --> 00:29:15,200
champions together so this is

889
00:29:15,200 --> 00:29:17,600
part of maybe a structure that you might

890
00:29:17,600 --> 00:29:18,399
want to consider

891
00:29:18,399 --> 00:29:21,440
periodically could be meetups um you

892
00:29:21,440 --> 00:29:23,200
might want to do that monthly on zoom

893
00:29:23,200 --> 00:29:24,080
bi-weekly

894
00:29:24,080 --> 00:29:27,120
on zoom um pre-coded or post-covered uh

895
00:29:27,120 --> 00:29:27,919
we'd be looking

896
00:29:27,919 --> 00:29:30,799
at maybe doing um in-person meetups so

897
00:29:30,799 --> 00:29:32,159
every six months every year

898
00:29:32,159 --> 00:29:34,480
perhaps having a retreat whereby all

899
00:29:34,480 --> 00:29:35,919
security champions go

900
00:29:35,919 --> 00:29:38,240
and maybe get some education discuss

901
00:29:38,240 --> 00:29:39,279
best practices

902
00:29:39,279 --> 00:29:42,080
talk about security with other champions

903
00:29:42,080 --> 00:29:43,200
um

904
00:29:43,200 --> 00:29:47,120
some of these meet up some of these

905
00:29:47,120 --> 00:29:49,679
ways of coming together can also be seen

906
00:29:49,679 --> 00:29:51,520
as great recognition as being part of

907
00:29:51,520 --> 00:29:52,240
that being

908
00:29:52,240 --> 00:29:54,399
belonging as part of that community as

909
00:29:54,399 --> 00:29:56,159
well

910
00:29:56,159 --> 00:29:57,360
one of the key things and one of the

911
00:29:57,360 --> 00:30:00,320
reasons why some of these

912
00:30:00,320 --> 00:30:03,679
programs fail is because these meetings

913
00:30:03,679 --> 00:30:05,679
don't have structure don't have

914
00:30:05,679 --> 00:30:07,120
expectations with them

915
00:30:07,120 --> 00:30:09,360
and so it's important for the security

916
00:30:09,360 --> 00:30:10,880
team to be able to

917
00:30:10,880 --> 00:30:14,000
uh facilitate these meetings facilitate

918
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:16,559
these meetups with clear expectations of

919
00:30:16,559 --> 00:30:18,399
what will be happening and what are the

920
00:30:18,399 --> 00:30:20,320
important topics to cover

921
00:30:20,320 --> 00:30:22,559
a lot of that can come from feedback

922
00:30:22,559 --> 00:30:24,080
from the developers but it needs to be

923
00:30:24,080 --> 00:30:25,840
structured and it needs to be clear

924
00:30:25,840 --> 00:30:29,600
about what everyone's getting them

925
00:30:29,600 --> 00:30:32,480
um now for large organizations some of

926
00:30:32,480 --> 00:30:34,159
the largest ones that i've spoken with

927
00:30:34,159 --> 00:30:37,440
they had teams of admins not even

928
00:30:37,440 --> 00:30:39,840
folks who were actually working on

929
00:30:39,840 --> 00:30:41,200
security-related issues

930
00:30:41,200 --> 00:30:42,880
but people who were dedicated to the

931
00:30:42,880 --> 00:30:45,200
logistics of the security program

932
00:30:45,200 --> 00:30:47,520
this could be scheduling the meetings uh

933
00:30:47,520 --> 00:30:49,919
doing work for recognition or rewards

934
00:30:49,919 --> 00:30:50,720
doing work

935
00:30:50,720 --> 00:30:53,919
for um you know

936
00:30:53,919 --> 00:30:55,760
recruitment and pulling the right people

937
00:30:55,760 --> 00:30:57,519
engineers etc in

938
00:30:57,519 --> 00:30:58,960
there's a number of different ways in

939
00:30:58,960 --> 00:31:00,720
which uh in which

940
00:31:00,720 --> 00:31:02,840
you know admins can can do that kind of

941
00:31:02,840 --> 00:31:04,880
work

942
00:31:04,880 --> 00:31:08,080
okay next we talked about

943
00:31:08,080 --> 00:31:10,000
rewards and recognition let's go a

944
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:11,440
little bit deeper into that so

945
00:31:11,440 --> 00:31:13,600
because rewards and recognition are

946
00:31:13,600 --> 00:31:15,039
certainly

947
00:31:15,039 --> 00:31:17,919
important for two reasons in my opinion

948
00:31:17,919 --> 00:31:19,200
first of all

949
00:31:19,200 --> 00:31:22,240
this is something which we want to make

950
00:31:22,240 --> 00:31:23,279
sure

951
00:31:23,279 --> 00:31:26,960
you know while people aren't

952
00:31:26,960 --> 00:31:29,279
doing this in addition to their day job

953
00:31:29,279 --> 00:31:30,159
because it should be

954
00:31:30,159 --> 00:31:32,399
a part of their day job while people

955
00:31:32,399 --> 00:31:33,760
aren't doing this in addition

956
00:31:33,760 --> 00:31:37,039
we want to recognize because these

957
00:31:37,039 --> 00:31:37,919
individuals

958
00:31:37,919 --> 00:31:41,919
who are going out their way to um

959
00:31:41,919 --> 00:31:44,720
to to improve the security of their of

960
00:31:44,720 --> 00:31:45,519
the process

961
00:31:45,519 --> 00:31:48,159
are having a real impact in the overall

962
00:31:48,159 --> 00:31:49,760
security of services

963
00:31:49,760 --> 00:31:52,080
and applications and so this needs to be

964
00:31:52,080 --> 00:31:53,279
recognized as something

965
00:31:53,279 --> 00:31:55,200
as a general development hygiene

966
00:31:55,200 --> 00:31:56,720
security hygiene improvement

967
00:31:56,720 --> 00:31:58,640
so rewards and recognition are very very

968
00:31:58,640 --> 00:32:01,200
important here but this is a community

969
00:32:01,200 --> 00:32:03,039
right and so we need to reward we need

970
00:32:03,039 --> 00:32:04,960
to encourage people to build that

971
00:32:04,960 --> 00:32:08,080
uh that community secondly

972
00:32:08,080 --> 00:32:10,960
this is a great way to actually pull

973
00:32:10,960 --> 00:32:12,399
others into the community

974
00:32:12,399 --> 00:32:13,919
there are different ways in which

975
00:32:13,919 --> 00:32:15,919
rewards and recognition can be given out

976
00:32:15,919 --> 00:32:19,440
i hate to say one is visibility uh or

977
00:32:19,440 --> 00:32:21,360
uh what's the other word exposure is the

978
00:32:21,360 --> 00:32:22,799
other one right when people

979
00:32:22,799 --> 00:32:24,640
when people uh go to conference talks

980
00:32:24,640 --> 00:32:26,000
what am i getting for this exposure

981
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:27,279
wonderful

982
00:32:27,279 --> 00:32:30,480
but this kind of recognition by

983
00:32:30,480 --> 00:32:32,240
having call outs by people whether

984
00:32:32,240 --> 00:32:34,000
that's a vp of engineering

985
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:35,440
and they call this individual out who

986
00:32:35,440 --> 00:32:37,120
did an amazing job

987
00:32:37,120 --> 00:32:40,399
um who perhaps you know added

988
00:32:40,399 --> 00:32:41,840
some security testing throughout the

989
00:32:41,840 --> 00:32:43,440
pipeline or has

990
00:32:43,440 --> 00:32:46,559
reduced um some

991
00:32:46,559 --> 00:32:48,640
measurements that you know numbers of

992
00:32:48,640 --> 00:32:49,919
vulnerabilities etc

993
00:32:49,919 --> 00:32:52,799
down to a specific level things that are

994
00:32:52,799 --> 00:32:53,440
fit you know

995
00:32:53,440 --> 00:32:55,440
actual results that can be that can be

996
00:32:55,440 --> 00:32:57,360
shown it's it's really important and

997
00:32:57,360 --> 00:32:59,279
then others in the organization can see

998
00:32:59,279 --> 00:32:59,679
that

999
00:32:59,679 --> 00:33:02,880
admire that and and perhaps want to

1000
00:33:02,880 --> 00:33:06,080
be part of that as well

1001
00:33:06,080 --> 00:33:08,640
so what does recognition look like well

1002
00:33:08,640 --> 00:33:10,080
it depends on the individuals as well

1003
00:33:10,080 --> 00:33:11,760
depends on the cultures but it could be

1004
00:33:11,760 --> 00:33:12,880
anything like

1005
00:33:12,880 --> 00:33:16,240
um going to a security conference defcon

1006
00:33:16,240 --> 00:33:16,960
black cat

1007
00:33:16,960 --> 00:33:19,360
it could be internal recognition as well

1008
00:33:19,360 --> 00:33:21,279
um whether it's bonuses whether it's

1009
00:33:21,279 --> 00:33:21,760
being

1010
00:33:21,760 --> 00:33:23,600
seen by management teams having call

1011
00:33:23,600 --> 00:33:25,200
outs uh uh

1012
00:33:25,200 --> 00:33:28,799
at meetings or um update meetings those

1013
00:33:28,799 --> 00:33:29,600
kind of things

1014
00:33:29,600 --> 00:33:31,519
uh internal company conferences

1015
00:33:31,519 --> 00:33:33,279
presenting successes

1016
00:33:33,279 --> 00:33:36,159
and also having call outs there of

1017
00:33:36,159 --> 00:33:36,960
course

1018
00:33:36,960 --> 00:33:39,039
t-shirts hoodies all the usual things

1019
00:33:39,039 --> 00:33:41,200
which people like to have as as part of

1020
00:33:41,200 --> 00:33:41,600
a

1021
00:33:41,600 --> 00:33:43,919
you know i'm part of this uh community

1022
00:33:43,919 --> 00:33:45,440
and and i got this because

1023
00:33:45,440 --> 00:33:47,760
of my work these are this really helps

1024
00:33:47,760 --> 00:33:49,600
the belonging and the association

1025
00:33:49,600 --> 00:33:53,840
um of the groups

1026
00:33:55,840 --> 00:33:58,240
okay what what are the actual activities

1027
00:33:58,240 --> 00:34:00,080
when then that we should we should be

1028
00:34:00,080 --> 00:34:02,000
looking at in a security champions what

1029
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:03,600
should we be doing

1030
00:34:03,600 --> 00:34:05,840
well this links very much back directly

1031
00:34:05,840 --> 00:34:06,640
to the goals

1032
00:34:06,640 --> 00:34:09,040
and the goals of the security champions

1033
00:34:09,040 --> 00:34:10,000
programs

1034
00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:11,839
we should pick the right activities that

1035
00:34:11,839 --> 00:34:13,839
that fit those goals

1036
00:34:13,839 --> 00:34:16,399
for some of the folks that i talked to

1037
00:34:16,399 --> 00:34:17,760
education was always

1038
00:34:17,760 --> 00:34:19,440
very very high up in the list the

1039
00:34:19,440 --> 00:34:21,040
improvement of secure development

1040
00:34:21,040 --> 00:34:22,399
practices and processes

1041
00:34:22,399 --> 00:34:24,239
um and vulnerability management was

1042
00:34:24,239 --> 00:34:25,440
another uh

1043
00:34:25,440 --> 00:34:28,480
was another you know very strong um

1044
00:34:28,480 --> 00:34:30,079
issue there as well threat modeling

1045
00:34:30,079 --> 00:34:31,520
which i guess you can kind of like add

1046
00:34:31,520 --> 00:34:32,879
into the secure development practices

1047
00:34:32,879 --> 00:34:34,480
there as well

1048
00:34:34,480 --> 00:34:35,839
there are a number of different things

1049
00:34:35,839 --> 00:34:37,760
you can do one thing i will

1050
00:34:37,760 --> 00:34:41,119
absolutely uh say here is

1051
00:34:41,119 --> 00:34:44,399
i would suggest um i would suggest

1052
00:34:44,399 --> 00:34:47,040
being clear and being simple with

1053
00:34:47,040 --> 00:34:48,079
picking one or two

1054
00:34:48,079 --> 00:34:49,679
things to start off with maybe even just

1055
00:34:49,679 --> 00:34:51,918
one to start off with and just saying

1056
00:34:51,918 --> 00:34:54,159
this is a security champions program and

1057
00:34:54,159 --> 00:34:54,960
all we're doing

1058
00:34:54,960 --> 00:34:57,200
is we're here to educate or all we're

1059
00:34:57,200 --> 00:34:58,000
doing is

1060
00:34:58,000 --> 00:35:00,640
we're here to improve secure development

1061
00:35:00,640 --> 00:35:01,359
be simple

1062
00:35:01,359 --> 00:35:04,640
and grow over time um

1063
00:35:04,640 --> 00:35:07,359
if we start with education um the

1064
00:35:07,359 --> 00:35:09,280
typical ways in which we have seen

1065
00:35:09,280 --> 00:35:11,440
uh and contrasted an excellent job in

1066
00:35:11,440 --> 00:35:12,960
this there's a there's a really good

1067
00:35:12,960 --> 00:35:15,200
um session uh that was given at a

1068
00:35:15,200 --> 00:35:16,160
conference uh

1069
00:35:16,160 --> 00:35:18,800
i can share the link out later uh but it

1070
00:35:18,800 --> 00:35:19,599
was given by

1071
00:35:19,599 --> 00:35:21,440
by comcast about how they did this

1072
00:35:21,440 --> 00:35:22,640
created this belt

1073
00:35:22,640 --> 00:35:25,680
system um for education and it this

1074
00:35:25,680 --> 00:35:26,480
depending on

1075
00:35:26,480 --> 00:35:29,520
how much time you spent on education or

1076
00:35:29,520 --> 00:35:30,880
how much time you spent

1077
00:35:30,880 --> 00:35:33,680
working with the internal teams and and

1078
00:35:33,680 --> 00:35:35,359
spending on your uh

1079
00:35:35,359 --> 00:35:38,400
internal processes that enabled you to

1080
00:35:38,400 --> 00:35:40,640
jump up the belt system

1081
00:35:40,640 --> 00:35:44,000
and the it provides you with the ability

1082
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:47,040
to know how many black belts brown belts

1083
00:35:47,040 --> 00:35:48,560
green belts blue belts whatever the

1084
00:35:48,560 --> 00:35:49,200
color

1085
00:35:49,200 --> 00:35:51,839
you need or should have in some of your

1086
00:35:51,839 --> 00:35:52,560
key

1087
00:35:52,560 --> 00:35:55,760
teams so for example for your for your

1088
00:35:55,760 --> 00:35:58,960
highest risk most sensitive areas of

1089
00:35:58,960 --> 00:35:59,599
your

1090
00:35:59,599 --> 00:36:02,400
of your uh applications and services you

1091
00:36:02,400 --> 00:36:04,400
you need to know that those teams

1092
00:36:04,400 --> 00:36:07,280
have you know an acceptable level of of

1093
00:36:07,280 --> 00:36:08,640
of security knowledge

1094
00:36:08,640 --> 00:36:10,480
um to reduce that risk and so you might

1095
00:36:10,480 --> 00:36:12,240
say for these teams we want a black belt

1096
00:36:12,240 --> 00:36:13,520
in every team or we want to we need a

1097
00:36:13,520 --> 00:36:14,800
brown belt on every team

1098
00:36:14,800 --> 00:36:16,640
to make sure that you know the people

1099
00:36:16,640 --> 00:36:17,920
who are in those teams

1100
00:36:17,920 --> 00:36:20,800
uh you have the best people um in the

1101
00:36:20,800 --> 00:36:23,760
highest risk areas

1102
00:36:23,760 --> 00:36:27,280
another um another great way

1103
00:36:27,280 --> 00:36:31,119
of um having a kpi or expectation being

1104
00:36:31,119 --> 00:36:32,400
at a show's success

1105
00:36:32,400 --> 00:36:34,160
is to show the growth or to show the

1106
00:36:34,160 --> 00:36:36,480
trend in which people are going up that

1107
00:36:36,480 --> 00:36:37,280
belt system

1108
00:36:37,280 --> 00:36:39,520
but there needs to be some reward as

1109
00:36:39,520 --> 00:36:41,520
well sometimes people see the the

1110
00:36:41,520 --> 00:36:43,200
gamification almost of being

1111
00:36:43,200 --> 00:36:46,640
that next belt as uh as their reward

1112
00:36:46,640 --> 00:36:49,760
um you need to also be clear

1113
00:36:49,760 --> 00:36:53,280
that um just because one team has

1114
00:36:53,280 --> 00:36:55,119
two brown belts and a black belt and

1115
00:36:55,119 --> 00:36:56,640
your team only has like a couple of

1116
00:36:56,640 --> 00:36:57,760
orange belts

1117
00:36:57,760 --> 00:36:59,839
that doesn't necessarily mean you know

1118
00:36:59,839 --> 00:37:01,599
you need to get to that level

1119
00:37:01,599 --> 00:37:04,800
they might need that security depth and

1120
00:37:04,800 --> 00:37:06,240
because of the application that they're

1121
00:37:06,240 --> 00:37:06,880
working on

1122
00:37:06,880 --> 00:37:08,480
and you don't necessarily need that all

1123
00:37:08,480 --> 00:37:10,160
throughout the organization you need to

1124
00:37:10,160 --> 00:37:11,520
be very clear about

1125
00:37:11,520 --> 00:37:14,000
which levels you need for each for each

1126
00:37:14,000 --> 00:37:16,160
area of the org

1127
00:37:16,160 --> 00:37:18,160
improving security development their

1128
00:37:18,160 --> 00:37:19,599
secure development is a journey really

1129
00:37:19,599 --> 00:37:21,119
that takes time

1130
00:37:21,119 --> 00:37:24,160
and it starts off with visibility so

1131
00:37:24,160 --> 00:37:26,720
having that visibility in what your

1132
00:37:26,720 --> 00:37:28,000
organizations

1133
00:37:28,000 --> 00:37:31,280
are are doing throughout their sdlc um

1134
00:37:31,280 --> 00:37:33,359
and this one of the best ways that i've

1135
00:37:33,359 --> 00:37:34,560
seen this work is

1136
00:37:34,560 --> 00:37:37,280
with a scorecard some people mandate the

1137
00:37:37,280 --> 00:37:38,880
scorecard throughout the organization

1138
00:37:38,880 --> 00:37:39,920
you basically

1139
00:37:39,920 --> 00:37:43,520
work with the security team to to work

1140
00:37:43,520 --> 00:37:44,240
through that

1141
00:37:44,240 --> 00:37:47,040
others security scorecard is one of the

1142
00:37:47,040 --> 00:37:48,560
first things that you will do

1143
00:37:48,560 --> 00:37:50,320
when you join the security champions

1144
00:37:50,320 --> 00:37:51,520
program and it's a great way to get that

1145
00:37:51,520 --> 00:37:52,400
visibility

1146
00:37:52,400 --> 00:37:54,400
into what is working what isn't working

1147
00:37:54,400 --> 00:37:56,560
what you are doing what you're not doing

1148
00:37:56,560 --> 00:38:00,320
um this is also if not done correctly

1149
00:38:00,320 --> 00:38:01,119
can also

1150
00:38:01,119 --> 00:38:02,480
look a little bit like a witch hunt in

1151
00:38:02,480 --> 00:38:04,720
terms of you know the security team

1152
00:38:04,720 --> 00:38:06,160
asking lots of questions the development

1153
00:38:06,160 --> 00:38:08,160
team getting a little bit defensive in

1154
00:38:08,160 --> 00:38:09,680
saying no we're not doing that no we're

1155
00:38:09,680 --> 00:38:11,440
not doing that and there's almost like a

1156
00:38:11,440 --> 00:38:12,800
level of guilt there so

1157
00:38:12,800 --> 00:38:14,560
it's a really good thing to do to let

1158
00:38:14,560 --> 00:38:16,480
the development teams own those kind of

1159
00:38:16,480 --> 00:38:18,000
scorecards and come to the security

1160
00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:20,480
team for the support for the for the

1161
00:38:20,480 --> 00:38:21,280
understanding

1162
00:38:21,280 --> 00:38:23,920
uh where needed so have the development

1163
00:38:23,920 --> 00:38:24,560
team

1164
00:38:24,560 --> 00:38:27,280
uh run the security scorecards

1165
00:38:27,280 --> 00:38:28,560
effectively a self-assessment it's a

1166
00:38:28,560 --> 00:38:29,920
good way to avoid

1167
00:38:29,920 --> 00:38:33,040
any conflict there and

1168
00:38:33,040 --> 00:38:35,680
the that gives the security team

1169
00:38:35,680 --> 00:38:36,960
visibility but it also

1170
00:38:36,960 --> 00:38:40,320
provides the security into the to ask

1171
00:38:40,320 --> 00:38:41,599
the development team

1172
00:38:41,599 --> 00:38:43,440
okay what do you want to fix next you

1173
00:38:43,440 --> 00:38:44,960
know give the development team that

1174
00:38:44,960 --> 00:38:46,079
empowerment to say

1175
00:38:46,079 --> 00:38:48,000
you know what we're going to own our own

1176
00:38:48,000 --> 00:38:49,280
security programs

1177
00:38:49,280 --> 00:38:51,680
what should we work on next and have the

1178
00:38:51,680 --> 00:38:53,040
security champion say

1179
00:38:53,040 --> 00:38:54,640
well actually these are the areas that i

1180
00:38:54,640 --> 00:38:56,240
feel our team

1181
00:38:56,240 --> 00:38:58,960
can can you know jump on board quicker

1182
00:38:58,960 --> 00:38:59,760
maybe it's

1183
00:38:59,760 --> 00:39:01,440
running adding some security testing to

1184
00:39:01,440 --> 00:39:03,040
get repos maybe it's

1185
00:39:03,040 --> 00:39:04,400
uh doing some threat modelling maybe

1186
00:39:04,400 --> 00:39:06,560
it's just plain education that

1187
00:39:06,560 --> 00:39:09,200
people care about uh it very much

1188
00:39:09,200 --> 00:39:10,640
depends on the team and the goals of the

1189
00:39:10,640 --> 00:39:12,640
development team as well

1190
00:39:12,640 --> 00:39:14,880
but this is also a good route to be able

1191
00:39:14,880 --> 00:39:15,760
to say

1192
00:39:15,760 --> 00:39:18,000
add your tasks of what the development

1193
00:39:18,000 --> 00:39:19,440
team want to achieve the development

1194
00:39:19,440 --> 00:39:21,040
team can talk about that together

1195
00:39:21,040 --> 00:39:23,280
um and then the security team can help

1196
00:39:23,280 --> 00:39:24,320
the development team

1197
00:39:24,320 --> 00:39:29,440
reach those reach those goals um

1198
00:39:29,440 --> 00:39:33,520
so yeah to summarize having

1199
00:39:33,520 --> 00:39:37,920
a developer-led developer-owned um

1200
00:39:37,920 --> 00:39:40,800
approach whereby the security coach

1201
00:39:40,800 --> 00:39:42,000
supports that

1202
00:39:42,000 --> 00:39:44,000
champion the champion sometimes does a

1203
00:39:44,000 --> 00:39:45,520
lot of that work but can

1204
00:39:45,520 --> 00:39:47,040
can can give that out to the team as

1205
00:39:47,040 --> 00:39:48,560
well um that's

1206
00:39:48,560 --> 00:39:51,440
that's the that's the model which we've

1207
00:39:51,440 --> 00:39:52,800
seen most successfully

1208
00:39:52,800 --> 00:39:56,800
uh work the premise here is that the

1209
00:39:56,800 --> 00:40:00,320
coach and the list of security champions

1210
00:40:00,320 --> 00:40:03,680
have shared kpis the success in the

1211
00:40:03,680 --> 00:40:06,560
in the security coach is the cumulative

1212
00:40:06,560 --> 00:40:07,440
successes

1213
00:40:07,440 --> 00:40:09,040
of each of those champions if the

1214
00:40:09,040 --> 00:40:11,200
champions are having success

1215
00:40:11,200 --> 00:40:13,119
then the coach is being successful in

1216
00:40:13,119 --> 00:40:14,480
rolling uh

1217
00:40:14,480 --> 00:40:16,160
rolling changes and rolling that

1218
00:40:16,160 --> 00:40:17,680
visibility through

1219
00:40:17,680 --> 00:40:20,399
in the programme

1220
00:40:20,880 --> 00:40:23,839
let's jump onto vulnerability management

1221
00:40:23,839 --> 00:40:25,280
this is another area which

1222
00:40:25,280 --> 00:40:29,119
we found was very um very

1223
00:40:29,119 --> 00:40:31,520
hot topic in terms of getting people to

1224
00:40:31,520 --> 00:40:32,240
um

1225
00:40:32,240 --> 00:40:35,280
to to see the flow so i think there are

1226
00:40:35,280 --> 00:40:36,480
a number of

1227
00:40:36,480 --> 00:40:37,839
ways in which this can be looked at and

1228
00:40:37,839 --> 00:40:40,240
again visibility is one of those key

1229
00:40:40,240 --> 00:40:43,359
areas whereby you know you can

1230
00:40:43,359 --> 00:40:46,400
grab a tool run some tests get the list

1231
00:40:46,400 --> 00:40:47,920
of vulnerabilities

1232
00:40:47,920 --> 00:40:50,319
but understanding what that means

1233
00:40:50,319 --> 00:40:52,240
getting context behind that

1234
00:40:52,240 --> 00:40:53,920
understanding what is high risk what is

1235
00:40:53,920 --> 00:40:56,000
not high risk a lot of the time

1236
00:40:56,000 --> 00:40:58,079
um this is needs to be a conversation

1237
00:40:58,079 --> 00:40:59,040
sometimes this

1238
00:40:59,040 --> 00:41:00,480
development team can kind of like work

1239
00:41:00,480 --> 00:41:02,240
on that and within guide rails

1240
00:41:02,240 --> 00:41:04,640
make decisions other times you need that

1241
00:41:04,640 --> 00:41:06,000
flow of information that flow of

1242
00:41:06,000 --> 00:41:06,640
discussion

1243
00:41:06,640 --> 00:41:08,319
that understanding of what you know

1244
00:41:08,319 --> 00:41:10,000
triaging should look like

1245
00:41:10,000 --> 00:41:11,760
uh and this is absolutely something

1246
00:41:11,760 --> 00:41:13,280
whereby this slick

1247
00:41:13,280 --> 00:41:15,200
communication and collaboration between

1248
00:41:15,200 --> 00:41:17,040
the security team the development team

1249
00:41:17,040 --> 00:41:18,400
through these security champions and

1250
00:41:18,400 --> 00:41:20,240
security coaches can be invaluable

1251
00:41:20,240 --> 00:41:20,880
because

1252
00:41:20,880 --> 00:41:23,359
things can happen a lot faster with

1253
00:41:23,359 --> 00:41:24,240
these

1254
00:41:24,240 --> 00:41:28,560
with these with these flows um

1255
00:41:29,440 --> 00:41:32,160
i would say the the last thing around

1256
00:41:32,160 --> 00:41:34,000
this is um

1257
00:41:34,000 --> 00:41:37,040
is pulling in uh

1258
00:41:37,040 --> 00:41:38,960
well actually threat modelling is one of

1259
00:41:38,960 --> 00:41:40,400
the other areas which

1260
00:41:40,400 --> 00:41:42,319
came up time and time again in in

1261
00:41:42,319 --> 00:41:44,560
discussions whereby

1262
00:41:44,560 --> 00:41:47,839
the development team are realistically

1263
00:41:47,839 --> 00:41:48,800
the only team

1264
00:41:48,800 --> 00:41:50,319
that understand the true architecture

1265
00:41:50,319 --> 00:41:52,720
flows the flows of the their application

1266
00:41:52,720 --> 00:41:53,920
and their services

1267
00:41:53,920 --> 00:41:55,760
what is being used every day in

1268
00:41:55,760 --> 00:41:57,440
production and what isn't

1269
00:41:57,440 --> 00:42:00,800
the security team of the team that knows

1270
00:42:00,800 --> 00:42:01,920
the real depth the

1271
00:42:01,920 --> 00:42:04,880
the real risk and the risk management of

1272
00:42:04,880 --> 00:42:05,680
of

1273
00:42:05,680 --> 00:42:09,040
pure security issues merging those two

1274
00:42:09,040 --> 00:42:10,079
together and having

1275
00:42:10,079 --> 00:42:13,200
those groups be present through threat

1276
00:42:13,200 --> 00:42:14,880
modelling through design

1277
00:42:14,880 --> 00:42:18,000
is is the obviously the best way of

1278
00:42:18,000 --> 00:42:19,200
doing threat modelling

1279
00:42:19,200 --> 00:42:21,440
and having a champions program to pull

1280
00:42:21,440 --> 00:42:22,560
those people in

1281
00:42:22,560 --> 00:42:23,920
this can be you know this could be one

1282
00:42:23,920 --> 00:42:25,680
of one of the great goals of a security

1283
00:42:25,680 --> 00:42:31,119
champions program

1284
00:42:31,119 --> 00:42:33,200
okay so how do we roll it out well i

1285
00:42:33,200 --> 00:42:35,200
guess there's a number of

1286
00:42:35,200 --> 00:42:38,240
ways in which you can choose the initial

1287
00:42:38,240 --> 00:42:40,800
set of champions that you want but the

1288
00:42:40,800 --> 00:42:42,560
initial set should be small

1289
00:42:42,560 --> 00:42:45,520
you should pick just a few teams that

1290
00:42:45,520 --> 00:42:46,880
you want to start with

1291
00:42:46,880 --> 00:42:49,920
you want to give them the same coach you

1292
00:42:49,920 --> 00:42:50,720
want to

1293
00:42:50,720 --> 00:42:53,839
have um you want to pick teams that

1294
00:42:53,839 --> 00:42:56,560
you know are potentially maybe the most

1295
00:42:56,560 --> 00:42:58,480
important services or applications

1296
00:42:58,480 --> 00:43:00,480
highest risk because those are the ones

1297
00:43:00,480 --> 00:43:02,160
we want to look at first

1298
00:43:02,160 --> 00:43:04,720
so higher priority uh areas of your

1299
00:43:04,720 --> 00:43:05,599
applications

1300
00:43:05,599 --> 00:43:08,319
we want to think maybe closer to teams

1301
00:43:08,319 --> 00:43:09,359
that are already

1302
00:43:09,359 --> 00:43:12,480
mature in whether it's development

1303
00:43:12,480 --> 00:43:14,560
processes devops security

1304
00:43:14,560 --> 00:43:17,280
um let's let's talk to people who are

1305
00:43:17,280 --> 00:43:17,839
very

1306
00:43:17,839 --> 00:43:20,000
capable of adapting to change who want

1307
00:43:20,000 --> 00:43:21,760
to change so you're not going to see

1308
00:43:21,760 --> 00:43:23,040
a lot of those conflicts right we don't

1309
00:43:23,040 --> 00:43:24,880
want to tackle all problems at once we

1310
00:43:24,880 --> 00:43:26,640
want to try to work out how we can get a

1311
00:43:26,640 --> 00:43:27,440
working

1312
00:43:27,440 --> 00:43:29,760
security cheap champions program first

1313
00:43:29,760 --> 00:43:31,200
and then cross all the other

1314
00:43:31,200 --> 00:43:34,400
issues as we as we get bigger

1315
00:43:34,400 --> 00:43:36,960
and also the security team individuals

1316
00:43:36,960 --> 00:43:38,640
in that team will already know

1317
00:43:38,640 --> 00:43:40,480
where they have great relationships with

1318
00:43:40,480 --> 00:43:41,680
individual developers

1319
00:43:41,680 --> 00:43:44,000
maybe talk to those developers first and

1320
00:43:44,000 --> 00:43:45,520
and see if they want to be part of that

1321
00:43:45,520 --> 00:43:47,280
program so there's a combination of

1322
00:43:47,280 --> 00:43:50,640
of those which um which will

1323
00:43:50,640 --> 00:43:52,880
create you that first uh initial group

1324
00:43:52,880 --> 00:43:55,040
of of people

1325
00:43:55,040 --> 00:43:59,359
um so one of the areas is if you can

1326
00:43:59,359 --> 00:44:00,720
try and get a common denominator of

1327
00:44:00,720 --> 00:44:02,400
goals so what we're saying there is

1328
00:44:02,400 --> 00:44:05,599
if if um you know you have three four

1329
00:44:05,599 --> 00:44:06,720
different security

1330
00:44:06,720 --> 00:44:08,319
champions and each of them are trying to

1331
00:44:08,319 --> 00:44:10,800
take on different aspects of security

1332
00:44:10,800 --> 00:44:13,359
it's a lot easier if you have a common

1333
00:44:13,359 --> 00:44:15,200
goal or a couple of common goals

1334
00:44:15,200 --> 00:44:17,200
that you can even pair people together

1335
00:44:17,200 --> 00:44:18,240
and have them talk

1336
00:44:18,240 --> 00:44:20,560
to each other about what they're doing

1337
00:44:20,560 --> 00:44:22,079
about what they're trying what works

1338
00:44:22,079 --> 00:44:24,160
what doesn't work

1339
00:44:24,160 --> 00:44:28,160
keep the risk low initially so

1340
00:44:28,160 --> 00:44:30,400
once you've got that and you've got the

1341
00:44:30,400 --> 00:44:32,560
resources the you've got the backing

1342
00:44:32,560 --> 00:44:34,640
of the exec team obviously the backing

1343
00:44:34,640 --> 00:44:35,680
of the management team

1344
00:44:35,680 --> 00:44:38,480
to to do that that's when you need to

1345
00:44:38,480 --> 00:44:39,520
start thinking

1346
00:44:39,520 --> 00:44:41,920
clearly about the actual things that you

1347
00:44:41,920 --> 00:44:42,880
want to achieve

1348
00:44:42,880 --> 00:44:45,040
and then start putting out a road map of

1349
00:44:45,040 --> 00:44:46,240
maybe one

1350
00:44:46,240 --> 00:44:48,640
two quarters three quarters this is

1351
00:44:48,640 --> 00:44:50,319
something that's a long

1352
00:44:50,319 --> 00:44:51,680
road this isn't something that you can

1353
00:44:51,680 --> 00:44:52,800
just like turn around in a couple of

1354
00:44:52,800 --> 00:44:53,599
weeks before

1355
00:44:53,599 --> 00:44:55,440
thinking about how we grow it again this

1356
00:44:55,440 --> 00:44:57,040
is something which needs to grow

1357
00:44:57,040 --> 00:45:00,560
organically and slowly so

1358
00:45:00,560 --> 00:45:04,000
the big question of course is well how

1359
00:45:04,000 --> 00:45:04,640
do we

1360
00:45:04,640 --> 00:45:06,319
know when to roll out further how do we

1361
00:45:06,319 --> 00:45:07,680
know when to grow it and

1362
00:45:07,680 --> 00:45:09,359
i think it's very easy to be able to

1363
00:45:09,359 --> 00:45:10,720
grow it uh

1364
00:45:10,720 --> 00:45:13,680
without thinking back about do we have

1365
00:45:13,680 --> 00:45:15,359
the right number of people in security

1366
00:45:15,359 --> 00:45:15,839
team

1367
00:45:15,839 --> 00:45:17,440
to be able to fulfill this because we

1368
00:45:17,440 --> 00:45:19,599
don't want just to grow the security

1369
00:45:19,599 --> 00:45:19,920
team

1370
00:45:19,920 --> 00:45:22,560
sorry grow the uh engineering number of

1371
00:45:22,560 --> 00:45:24,560
engineering security champions into this

1372
00:45:24,560 --> 00:45:27,359
but not have the right uh the backing to

1373
00:45:27,359 --> 00:45:28,720
support that so make sure you

1374
00:45:28,720 --> 00:45:30,480
absolutely have that also make sure

1375
00:45:30,480 --> 00:45:32,319
you're seeing success

1376
00:45:32,319 --> 00:45:36,319
within those teams as well

1377
00:45:37,040 --> 00:45:39,280
okay so what does success look like then

1378
00:45:39,280 --> 00:45:40,400
how do we know

1379
00:45:40,400 --> 00:45:42,240
when to roll out because when we when

1380
00:45:42,240 --> 00:45:43,920
are we seeing success well as i

1381
00:45:43,920 --> 00:45:45,680
mentioned just now

1382
00:45:45,680 --> 00:45:47,040
it's really imperative that we don't

1383
00:45:47,040 --> 00:45:49,200
expect incredible amazing things within

1384
00:45:49,200 --> 00:45:50,160
days or weeks

1385
00:45:50,160 --> 00:45:53,359
of of uh or even months you know

1386
00:45:53,359 --> 00:45:55,599
we this is a slow process it needs to be

1387
00:45:55,599 --> 00:45:57,200
a long road it needs to be a it's a this

1388
00:45:57,200 --> 00:46:00,240
is a strategy that we want to employ um

1389
00:46:00,240 --> 00:46:02,880
we need to grow this organically and as

1390
00:46:02,880 --> 00:46:03,599
a result

1391
00:46:03,599 --> 00:46:06,800
we're not gonna you know have amazing

1392
00:46:06,800 --> 00:46:08,480
results straight away and if we do

1393
00:46:08,480 --> 00:46:09,839
let's celebrate them but let's not

1394
00:46:09,839 --> 00:46:11,440
expect them so what do we what do we

1395
00:46:11,440 --> 00:46:13,520
actually want to to measure

1396
00:46:13,520 --> 00:46:16,319
well from a new security champions

1397
00:46:16,319 --> 00:46:17,359
program

1398
00:46:17,359 --> 00:46:19,599
let's talk to individuals and ask them

1399
00:46:19,599 --> 00:46:20,480
is it clear

1400
00:46:20,480 --> 00:46:22,240
is it you know do you know what you're

1401
00:46:22,240 --> 00:46:24,000
getting from it let's talk to them and

1402
00:46:24,000 --> 00:46:24,560
see

1403
00:46:24,560 --> 00:46:28,000
let's even just see how many people are

1404
00:46:28,000 --> 00:46:30,240
are willing are wanting to come into the

1405
00:46:30,240 --> 00:46:31,920
program how well is it being

1406
00:46:31,920 --> 00:46:35,440
uh adopted how well is it being adopted

1407
00:46:35,440 --> 00:46:37,040
within the engineering teams

1408
00:46:37,040 --> 00:46:39,920
as well it's important for each uh

1409
00:46:39,920 --> 00:46:41,920
champions

1410
00:46:41,920 --> 00:46:44,079
participation to be voluntary but how

1411
00:46:44,079 --> 00:46:46,079
well are their suggestions

1412
00:46:46,079 --> 00:46:48,000
uh and their recommendations going

1413
00:46:48,000 --> 00:46:49,760
through the through the development team

1414
00:46:49,760 --> 00:46:52,880
is it having an effect at that low level

1415
00:46:52,880 --> 00:46:55,280
so signs of adoption could be an

1416
00:46:55,280 --> 00:46:56,240
important metric

1417
00:46:56,240 --> 00:46:58,319
signs of uh growth of the group over

1418
00:46:58,319 --> 00:46:59,920
time if it is organic

1419
00:46:59,920 --> 00:47:02,240
the retention of champions and how

1420
00:47:02,240 --> 00:47:03,760
active champions are

1421
00:47:03,760 --> 00:47:05,599
our champions going to the bye weeklies

1422
00:47:05,599 --> 00:47:07,280
our champions filling out their

1423
00:47:07,280 --> 00:47:08,000
scorecards

1424
00:47:08,000 --> 00:47:10,000
our champions putting a plan together

1425
00:47:10,000 --> 00:47:11,200
our champions

1426
00:47:11,200 --> 00:47:14,319
meeting their own goals for those plans

1427
00:47:14,319 --> 00:47:16,480
so the engagement of members is

1428
00:47:16,480 --> 00:47:18,240
something that's fairly easy to track

1429
00:47:18,240 --> 00:47:20,960
um and and also shows whether that

1430
00:47:20,960 --> 00:47:24,400
relationship is effective

1431
00:47:24,400 --> 00:47:26,559
it's a harder one and not necessarily

1432
00:47:26,559 --> 00:47:27,920
something that you

1433
00:47:27,920 --> 00:47:30,160
that you want to do but if you are

1434
00:47:30,160 --> 00:47:32,160
saying you want to spend 20

1435
00:47:32,160 --> 00:47:35,359
of your time in doing security tasks

1436
00:47:35,359 --> 00:47:37,280
you might say you know if you are

1437
00:47:37,280 --> 00:47:39,440
tracking time in those kind of ways

1438
00:47:39,440 --> 00:47:42,240
you could say is this developer you know

1439
00:47:42,240 --> 00:47:43,280
spending 20

1440
00:47:43,280 --> 00:47:46,640
of their of their sprint time in in a uh

1441
00:47:46,640 --> 00:47:49,040
doing security work or not um you don't

1442
00:47:49,040 --> 00:47:50,240
necessarily

1443
00:47:50,240 --> 00:47:51,839
want to introduce that if you're not if

1444
00:47:51,839 --> 00:47:53,440
you're not doing that today

1445
00:47:53,440 --> 00:47:56,240
um there are pros and cons in you know

1446
00:47:56,240 --> 00:47:58,400
using those kind of approaches anyway so

1447
00:47:58,400 --> 00:48:00,240
um not something that i would say you

1448
00:48:00,240 --> 00:48:01,920
know if you're not doing it today

1449
00:48:01,920 --> 00:48:03,440
i wouldn't necessarily recommend jumping

1450
00:48:03,440 --> 00:48:05,119
to it

1451
00:48:05,119 --> 00:48:08,880
um so another

1452
00:48:08,880 --> 00:48:12,160
big success is um

1453
00:48:12,160 --> 00:48:13,599
the improvements that the dev team are

1454
00:48:13,599 --> 00:48:15,440
working on and this comes back a lot to

1455
00:48:15,440 --> 00:48:16,720
success stories so

1456
00:48:16,720 --> 00:48:19,440
in a quarter we're in a couple of

1457
00:48:19,440 --> 00:48:20,079
quarters

1458
00:48:20,079 --> 00:48:21,440
what are the big changes that have

1459
00:48:21,440 --> 00:48:23,359
happened and be very anecdotal here

1460
00:48:23,359 --> 00:48:25,440
particularly with the with the uh the

1461
00:48:25,440 --> 00:48:27,839
initial rollout be very anecdotal that

1462
00:48:27,839 --> 00:48:29,680
you know since this date we've always

1463
00:48:29,680 --> 00:48:30,960
done threat modelling since

1464
00:48:30,960 --> 00:48:33,440
this date um we've managed to reduce our

1465
00:48:33,440 --> 00:48:35,040
backlog since this date

1466
00:48:35,040 --> 00:48:37,040
we've added automated testing of

1467
00:48:37,040 --> 00:48:39,200
whatever throughout our pipeline

1468
00:48:39,200 --> 00:48:41,440
okay so be very anecdotal be very

1469
00:48:41,440 --> 00:48:43,119
specific about the improvements that are

1470
00:48:43,119 --> 00:48:44,240
happening

1471
00:48:44,240 --> 00:48:46,800
share those as success stories try and

1472
00:48:46,800 --> 00:48:47,359
encourage

1473
00:48:47,359 --> 00:48:50,559
other teams to follow in that success um

1474
00:48:50,559 --> 00:48:51,119
and and

1475
00:48:51,119 --> 00:48:53,839
roll out beyond the security champions

1476
00:48:53,839 --> 00:48:54,880
program as well

1477
00:48:54,880 --> 00:48:56,640
by saying hey this is what this team are

1478
00:48:56,640 --> 00:48:58,720
doing and you'll find other individuals

1479
00:48:58,720 --> 00:48:59,280
maybe

1480
00:48:59,280 --> 00:49:01,760
trying to do that in their teams and

1481
00:49:01,760 --> 00:49:03,119
that is where you look at those

1482
00:49:03,119 --> 00:49:04,240
individuals and say oh

1483
00:49:04,240 --> 00:49:06,319
excellent you are a potential future

1484
00:49:06,319 --> 00:49:08,319
champion that we might want to

1485
00:49:08,319 --> 00:49:11,440
uh you know roll in to the program when

1486
00:49:11,440 --> 00:49:14,079
we next look at uh growing

1487
00:49:14,079 --> 00:49:14,960
how many people are doing their

1488
00:49:14,960 --> 00:49:17,200
scorecards is another great one how much

1489
00:49:17,200 --> 00:49:18,720
visibility how much additional

1490
00:49:18,720 --> 00:49:20,960
visibility do development teams

1491
00:49:20,960 --> 00:49:22,960
so do security teams have in the

1492
00:49:22,960 --> 00:49:24,720
organization a very very strong

1493
00:49:24,720 --> 00:49:27,200
uh success as well a couple of things

1494
00:49:27,200 --> 00:49:28,960
that i will mention here is that be very

1495
00:49:28,960 --> 00:49:30,720
careful with numbers of course

1496
00:49:30,720 --> 00:49:32,319
because you need to understand what is a

1497
00:49:32,319 --> 00:49:33,920
good metric and what isn't a good metric

1498
00:49:33,920 --> 00:49:36,800
uh just because you see huge numbers of

1499
00:49:36,800 --> 00:49:38,319
vulnerabilities on one side and none

1500
00:49:38,319 --> 00:49:39,040
over here

1501
00:49:39,040 --> 00:49:40,319
that could just mean that they have

1502
00:49:40,319 --> 00:49:41,920
excellent visibility into their number

1503
00:49:41,920 --> 00:49:42,640
of issues

1504
00:49:42,640 --> 00:49:44,319
whereas this team have no idea how many

1505
00:49:44,319 --> 00:49:45,599
issues they are they're not testing as

1506
00:49:45,599 --> 00:49:46,000
much

1507
00:49:46,000 --> 00:49:47,920
so be very careful about numbers without

1508
00:49:47,920 --> 00:49:50,079
context but where you can

1509
00:49:50,079 --> 00:49:53,920
show um trends over time so

1510
00:49:53,920 --> 00:49:56,000
you know while the number of commits for

1511
00:49:56,000 --> 00:49:57,200
example uh

1512
00:49:57,200 --> 00:50:00,079
in this in this uh repository has stayed

1513
00:50:00,079 --> 00:50:00,720
constant

1514
00:50:00,720 --> 00:50:02,319
we're seeing the number of overall

1515
00:50:02,319 --> 00:50:03,920
backlog vulnerabilities be reduced

1516
00:50:03,920 --> 00:50:04,559
because

1517
00:50:04,559 --> 00:50:06,800
uh we've been you know we're we're

1518
00:50:06,800 --> 00:50:08,559
reducing the number intentionally over

1519
00:50:08,559 --> 00:50:10,319
over the last however many sprints be

1520
00:50:10,319 --> 00:50:12,079
very um specific about

1521
00:50:12,079 --> 00:50:15,520
why numbers are changing as well

1522
00:50:15,520 --> 00:50:19,040
um okay and yeah the success like i say

1523
00:50:19,040 --> 00:50:20,880
the success of this needs to be shared

1524
00:50:20,880 --> 00:50:21,359
between

1525
00:50:21,359 --> 00:50:23,680
the champion and the uh and the security

1526
00:50:23,680 --> 00:50:24,960
coach

1527
00:50:24,960 --> 00:50:27,920
uh another level of success is if you if

1528
00:50:27,920 --> 00:50:29,280
you're doing things in education how

1529
00:50:29,280 --> 00:50:30,400
many people have you got in the right

1530
00:50:30,400 --> 00:50:30,880
belts

1531
00:50:30,880 --> 00:50:32,640
how much improvement is happening over

1532
00:50:32,640 --> 00:50:34,640
time how many people are actually

1533
00:50:34,640 --> 00:50:37,680
uh invested in that um

1534
00:50:37,680 --> 00:50:39,920
as well how many times have you

1535
00:50:39,920 --> 00:50:41,359
celebrated your accomplishments how many

1536
00:50:41,359 --> 00:50:42,000
times

1537
00:50:42,000 --> 00:50:44,400
have you um you know been able to

1538
00:50:44,400 --> 00:50:45,119
showcase

1539
00:50:45,119 --> 00:50:47,520
individuals or had call outs to

1540
00:50:47,520 --> 00:50:48,400
different people

1541
00:50:48,400 --> 00:50:51,440
by vps etc this is

1542
00:50:51,440 --> 00:50:53,520
one of the great ways in which success

1543
00:50:53,520 --> 00:50:54,559
can can be seen

1544
00:50:54,559 --> 00:50:56,559
success is also one of the hardest

1545
00:50:56,559 --> 00:50:57,839
things to actually

1546
00:50:57,839 --> 00:51:00,640
to actually show so anecdotal evidence

1547
00:51:00,640 --> 00:51:02,000
uh is extremely important

1548
00:51:02,000 --> 00:51:03,359
and being able to celebrate those

1549
00:51:03,359 --> 00:51:05,119
successes through rewards and

1550
00:51:05,119 --> 00:51:06,160
recognition

1551
00:51:06,160 --> 00:51:09,760
is equally important so yeah

1552
00:51:09,760 --> 00:51:11,119
i'll i'll finish there and i'll i'll

1553
00:51:11,119 --> 00:51:13,359
kind of just say what i said at the

1554
00:51:13,359 --> 00:51:15,040
start which was

1555
00:51:15,040 --> 00:51:17,280
one security champions program can't

1556
00:51:17,280 --> 00:51:19,200
just be lifted and shifted and dropped

1557
00:51:19,200 --> 00:51:20,800
down onto another organization

1558
00:51:20,800 --> 00:51:22,559
it's very important that the security

1559
00:51:22,559 --> 00:51:24,559
program that you

1560
00:51:24,559 --> 00:51:26,480
add into your organization if you want

1561
00:51:26,480 --> 00:51:27,839
to add one is

1562
00:51:27,839 --> 00:51:30,720
is very clear has the well-defined goals

1563
00:51:30,720 --> 00:51:32,240
is understood exactly

1564
00:51:32,240 --> 00:51:34,079
what those goals are by the engineering

1565
00:51:34,079 --> 00:51:35,599
organization as well as

1566
00:51:35,599 --> 00:51:39,280
others in in the teams and that

1567
00:51:39,280 --> 00:51:42,960
um is is is

1568
00:51:42,960 --> 00:51:45,599
you know run over time as a long-term

1569
00:51:45,599 --> 00:51:47,280
thing

1570
00:51:47,280 --> 00:51:49,599
and grown organically these are some of

1571
00:51:49,599 --> 00:51:50,880
the ways in which

1572
00:51:50,880 --> 00:51:54,079
i feel the most successful organizations

1573
00:51:54,079 --> 00:51:55,520
are running security champions programs

1574
00:51:55,520 --> 00:51:56,880
today

1575
00:51:56,880 --> 00:52:00,240
so with that i'll i'll um pass back over

1576
00:52:00,240 --> 00:52:01,680
to sam

1577
00:52:01,680 --> 00:52:04,559
and see if there's any questions or any

1578
00:52:04,559 --> 00:52:05,200
comments

1579
00:52:05,200 --> 00:52:08,319
on uh on any of that wow that was an

1580
00:52:08,319 --> 00:52:10,160
awesome session i definitely learned a

1581
00:52:10,160 --> 00:52:12,800
lot thank you so much simon no worries

1582
00:52:12,800 --> 00:52:13,920
and we've had some really interesting

1583
00:52:13,920 --> 00:52:15,520
actually discussions on the chat around

1584
00:52:15,520 --> 00:52:17,440
how other people are structured and

1585
00:52:17,440 --> 00:52:19,280
um a bit of a conversation happening

1586
00:52:19,280 --> 00:52:20,480
around

1587
00:52:20,480 --> 00:52:21,520
because you know if you've seen this

1588
00:52:21,520 --> 00:52:23,599
from your findings is that um

1589
00:52:23,599 --> 00:52:25,200
you know obviously when you have a

1590
00:52:25,200 --> 00:52:27,920
security instance in production you have

1591
00:52:27,920 --> 00:52:30,160
bug bounty programs and things like that

1592
00:52:30,160 --> 00:52:32,079
and if any sort of security champion

1593
00:52:32,079 --> 00:52:35,280
compensation on finding that floor

1594
00:52:35,280 --> 00:52:36,880
before it goes into production almost

1595
00:52:36,880 --> 00:52:38,480
like you you know you saved the company

1596
00:52:38,480 --> 00:52:40,240
x amounts of money in bag bounty so you

1597
00:52:40,240 --> 00:52:41,920
get this reward like have you seen

1598
00:52:41,920 --> 00:52:44,480
any of that happen no i haven't seen i

1599
00:52:44,480 --> 00:52:46,000
haven't seen anything quite like that

1600
00:52:46,000 --> 00:52:48,000
in terms of like effectively pulling

1601
00:52:48,000 --> 00:52:49,760
pulling that bug bounty uh

1602
00:52:49,760 --> 00:52:52,880
bug bounty amount through um

1603
00:52:52,880 --> 00:52:55,119
one thing one thing though that has that

1604
00:52:55,119 --> 00:52:56,559
was discussed and actually this kind of

1605
00:52:56,559 --> 00:52:57,040
like does

1606
00:52:57,040 --> 00:52:59,680
tie back into measurements is what how

1607
00:52:59,680 --> 00:53:01,200
do you how do you prove

1608
00:53:01,200 --> 00:53:03,599
that you have reduced the amount of

1609
00:53:03,599 --> 00:53:05,280
vulnerabilities potentially

1610
00:53:05,280 --> 00:53:06,880
through some of your early actions so

1611
00:53:06,880 --> 00:53:08,079
it's you know it's a great it's a great

1612
00:53:08,079 --> 00:53:08,960
point in terms of

1613
00:53:08,960 --> 00:53:10,240
let's say you do a threat modeling

1614
00:53:10,240 --> 00:53:11,599
session how do you know how many

1615
00:53:11,599 --> 00:53:12,480
vulnerabilities

1616
00:53:12,480 --> 00:53:13,920
you are reducing there you're not taking

1617
00:53:13,920 --> 00:53:15,440
stuff off the backlog you're actually

1618
00:53:15,440 --> 00:53:16,880
reducing the number that yeah that

1619
00:53:16,880 --> 00:53:18,400
you're introducing in so

1620
00:53:18,400 --> 00:53:21,280
um being able to explain your process

1621
00:53:21,280 --> 00:53:22,720
changes and things like that are just as

1622
00:53:22,720 --> 00:53:23,920
good as those but i've not

1623
00:53:23,920 --> 00:53:25,599
i've not seen people you know kind of

1624
00:53:25,599 --> 00:53:27,119
like shift bug bounty

1625
00:53:27,119 --> 00:53:28,319
monies or anything like that but that

1626
00:53:28,319 --> 00:53:29,440
sounds like an interesting uh

1627
00:53:29,440 --> 00:53:30,559
interesting case

1628
00:53:30,559 --> 00:53:32,000
yeah there definitely is a conversation

1629
00:53:32,000 --> 00:53:33,280
happening around in the slack so if

1630
00:53:33,280 --> 00:53:34,880
anyone is listening and has seen it or

1631
