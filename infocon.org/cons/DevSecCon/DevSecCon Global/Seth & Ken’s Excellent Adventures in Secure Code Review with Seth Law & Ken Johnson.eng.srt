00:00:09,360 --> 00:00:10,920
first time here we're an inclusive

4
00:00:10,920 --> 00:00:13,049
community that enables and educates

5
00:00:13,049 --> 00:00:15,330
developers and application security I am

6
00:00:15,330 --> 00:00:17,550
joined today by Cyril and Kim Johnson

7
00:00:17,550 --> 00:00:18,779
and they're going to be talking about

8
00:00:18,779 --> 00:00:20,850
their excellent adventures in secure

9
00:00:20,850 --> 00:00:23,580
coding toad review should I say but

10
00:00:23,580 --> 00:00:24,990
before we get started all about me I am

11
00:00:24,990 --> 00:00:27,300
the community manager here and the humor

12
00:00:27,300 --> 00:00:28,439
that works behind the scenes - any

13
00:00:28,439 --> 00:00:32,159
questions any session ideas topics feel

00:00:32,159 --> 00:00:35,340
free to tweet me a DM me email me all of

15
00:00:35,340 --> 00:00:36,570
the different channels as well as you

16
00:00:36,570 --> 00:00:38,520
can get me on slack so slack is the best

17
00:00:38,520 --> 00:00:40,559
way to interact today so if you've got

18
00:00:40,559 --> 00:00:42,899
any questions for our both in except and

19
00:00:42,899 --> 00:00:44,789
Kim during the session or even after if

20
00:00:44,789 --> 00:00:46,850
you're watching this post live recording

21
00:00:46,850 --> 00:00:49,140
during the slack you can ask questions

22
00:00:49,140 --> 00:00:50,520
and we'll get them answered for you if

23
00:00:50,520 --> 00:00:51,989
you're not a member if you go to be

24
00:00:51,989 --> 00:00:54,420
secure developer calm and you can find

25
00:00:54,420 --> 00:00:56,250
all the information there as well as

26
00:00:56,250 --> 00:01:00,329
watch any of our past sessions and but

27
00:01:00,329 --> 00:01:02,520
again enough from me I really want to

28
00:01:02,520 --> 00:01:04,319
make sure that we get a lot from a lot

29
00:01:04,319 --> 00:01:05,880
of time with staff and kids today so I'm

30
00:01:05,880 --> 00:01:08,130
gonna hand over to them so said again

31
00:01:08,130 --> 00:01:10,640
welcome to these secured available

32
00:01:10,640 --> 00:01:13,500
thanks thanks for having us we're

33
00:01:13,500 --> 00:01:15,060
excited to be here

34
00:01:15,060 --> 00:01:17,430
obviously ken and I are pretty familiar

35
00:01:17,430 --> 00:01:20,280
with the podcasting or the pot you know

36
00:01:20,280 --> 00:01:23,189
the video casting world so we've got a

37
00:01:23,189 --> 00:01:25,380
lot to review today so thanks again for

38
00:01:25,380 --> 00:01:27,570
having us you know give us the platform

39
00:01:27,570 --> 00:01:29,310
to talk more about secure code reviews

40
00:01:29,310 --> 00:01:36,240
and what we do on a daily basis okay all

41
00:01:36,240 --> 00:01:36,570
right

42
00:01:36,570 --> 00:01:39,150
ken did you want to share out the you

43
00:01:39,150 --> 00:01:41,670
want to share your screen okay I can

44
00:01:41,670 --> 00:01:46,490
totally do that yep once I figure it out

45
00:01:46,490 --> 00:01:50,180
all right here we go just stop - all

46
00:01:50,180 --> 00:01:53,759
right that should look pretty good

47
00:01:53,759 --> 00:01:57,899
hopefully let me just change one thing

48
00:01:57,899 --> 00:02:01,860
around real quick just gonna redo a

49
00:02:01,860 --> 00:02:04,649
little rearrangement here so that I keep

50
00:02:04,649 --> 00:02:06,740
my sanity as I switch between Windows

51
00:02:06,740 --> 00:02:09,758
all right so now we should

52
00:02:09,758 --> 00:02:11,650
and let me close that and go back to

53
00:02:11,650 --> 00:02:14,530
this alright so you should see this live

54
00:02:14,530 --> 00:02:15,580
everybody good

55
00:02:15,580 --> 00:02:17,909
no we're not seeing the slides right now

56
00:02:17,909 --> 00:02:22,120
we have seen a wide screen okay let me

57
00:02:22,120 --> 00:02:31,510
stop the shirt and try again okay now

58
00:02:31,510 --> 00:02:33,870
can you stay yep

59
00:02:33,870 --> 00:02:37,989
awesome oh hey I saw Magne Magne logan's

60
00:02:37,989 --> 00:02:41,620
in the in the chat cool cool cool person

61
00:02:41,620 --> 00:02:44,470
from Brazil anyway so yeah this is our

62
00:02:44,470 --> 00:02:48,730
this is our very very condensed hour of

63
00:02:48,730 --> 00:02:53,140
a 2 in / 3-day course depending on the

64
00:02:53,140 --> 00:02:55,269
location in the format so we're gonna

65
00:02:55,269 --> 00:02:57,540
get through what we can in an hour and

66
00:02:57,540 --> 00:02:59,859
this is all about secure code review

67
00:02:59,859 --> 00:03:02,079
obviously that's you know hopefully

68
00:03:02,079 --> 00:03:04,150
while you're here Seth do you want to

69
00:03:04,150 --> 00:03:07,030
introduce yourself we'll just do quick

70
00:03:07,030 --> 00:03:08,230
intros really quick

71
00:03:08,230 --> 00:03:10,829
I run a consultancy red point security

72
00:03:10,829 --> 00:03:14,169
and I've been a consultant for a number

73
00:03:14,169 --> 00:03:15,730
of years I actually started way back in

74
00:03:15,730 --> 00:03:17,500
the day at I Omega if people who

75
00:03:17,500 --> 00:03:20,380
remember the zip drive people that's

76
00:03:20,380 --> 00:03:22,359
that's where I started my coding career

77
00:03:22,359 --> 00:03:24,099
and then moved into security from there

78
00:03:24,099 --> 00:03:27,579
so I do all things application security

79
00:03:27,579 --> 00:03:28,930
related through the consulting company

80
00:03:28,930 --> 00:03:35,200
now that's who I am and I am a staff app

81
00:03:35,200 --> 00:03:39,389
sec engineer at github and before that

82
00:03:39,389 --> 00:03:42,040
so my main job is to do secure code

83
00:03:42,040 --> 00:03:43,569
reviews that's probably the most

84
00:03:43,569 --> 00:03:47,169
relevant bit of my the information about

85
00:03:47,169 --> 00:03:49,180
myself before that yeah I've done I

86
00:03:49,180 --> 00:03:51,549
actually got my first start in

87
00:03:51,549 --> 00:03:54,280
consulting because of Seth Seth

88
00:03:54,280 --> 00:03:55,989
interviewed me for that position after

89
00:03:55,989 --> 00:03:58,379
that that was that fish net now Optive

90
00:03:58,379 --> 00:04:02,680
after that it was LivingSocial which was

91
00:04:02,680 --> 00:04:04,930
a competitor Groupon and then after that

92
00:04:04,930 --> 00:04:07,989
was a consult security consulting

93
00:04:07,989 --> 00:04:10,780
company for about like five years and

94
00:04:10,780 --> 00:04:14,349
now I work at Gap so anyways that the

95
00:04:14,349 --> 00:04:15,940
most relevant bit is throughout all

96
00:04:15,940 --> 00:04:18,579
those jobs I've done secure code review

97
00:04:18,579 --> 00:04:20,890
yeah both Ken and I have done it for a

98
00:04:20,890 --> 00:04:23,350
while so we also host a

99
00:04:23,350 --> 00:04:25,660
competing podcasts should we say say no

100
00:04:25,660 --> 00:04:28,660
not really it's just the two of us it's

101
00:04:28,660 --> 00:04:30,520
called absolute absolute we talk you

102
00:04:30,520 --> 00:04:31,870
know we interview people in the industry

103
00:04:31,870 --> 00:04:33,640
and talk about application security

104
00:04:33,640 --> 00:04:35,500
topics we don't necessarily do

105
00:04:35,500 --> 00:04:37,860
walkthroughs like this it's more of a

106
00:04:37,860 --> 00:04:41,290
just general discussion general news and

107
00:04:41,290 --> 00:04:42,940
whatever we feel like we want to

108
00:04:42,940 --> 00:04:45,250
complain about right so that's absolute

109
00:04:45,250 --> 00:04:46,990
abject you can find us online or

110
00:04:46,990 --> 00:04:48,790
wherever later

111
00:04:48,790 --> 00:04:50,920
so yeah let's jump into actually secure

112
00:04:50,920 --> 00:04:53,050
code reviews Ken yeah that's that's

113
00:04:53,050 --> 00:04:54,820
joking about the competition bit because

114
00:04:54,820 --> 00:04:57,250
it's so it's like so unprofessional have

115
00:04:57,250 --> 00:05:00,910
a podcast in comparison so anyway stop

116
00:05:00,910 --> 00:05:03,760
all right so the philosophy and this is

117
00:05:03,760 --> 00:05:05,380
a super-important this isn't just some

118
00:05:05,380 --> 00:05:07,420
stuff we added this is a reason this is

119
00:05:07,420 --> 00:05:09,040
in here or there's several reasons this

120
00:05:09,040 --> 00:05:11,410
is in here so when people think about

121
00:05:11,410 --> 00:05:13,810
secure code review oftentimes what we'll

122
00:05:13,810 --> 00:05:16,000
find is especially if they're only into

123
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:17,860
this within like we'll say zero to three

124
00:05:17,860 --> 00:05:22,120
years is the the mentality is that you

125
00:05:22,120 --> 00:05:23,560
are supposed to find every single bug

126
00:05:23,560 --> 00:05:25,630
that exists you're supposed to you know

127
00:05:25,630 --> 00:05:32,020
have such a comprehensive an and the

128
00:05:32,020 --> 00:05:33,550
next person that comes behind you in six

129
00:05:33,550 --> 00:05:35,410
months or a year they won't ever find

130
00:05:35,410 --> 00:05:36,760
anything that you haven't already found

131
00:05:36,760 --> 00:05:38,440
ideally and if you're running a bug

132
00:05:38,440 --> 00:05:39,910
bounty program certainly the bug bounty

133
00:05:39,910 --> 00:05:41,620
the bug bounty people aren't gonna find

134
00:05:41,620 --> 00:05:43,930
would you know there's a shouldn't find

135
00:05:43,930 --> 00:05:47,590
what what you did right like that's

136
00:05:47,590 --> 00:05:49,510
that's what a lot of people believe and

137
00:05:49,510 --> 00:05:52,330
to dispel I mean to spill that notion

138
00:05:52,330 --> 00:05:56,050
all of that is untrue right you're gonna

139
00:05:56,050 --> 00:05:59,470
find ideally the most critical high-risk

140
00:05:59,470 --> 00:06:01,840
things right that that's that's the

141
00:06:01,840 --> 00:06:04,680
reality and depending on your time frame

142
00:06:04,680 --> 00:06:08,080
you may find all of them or you may not

143
00:06:08,080 --> 00:06:10,540
so that's that's the reality like we

144
00:06:10,540 --> 00:06:11,920
should start there with that kind of

145
00:06:11,920 --> 00:06:15,100
like hard reality the other bit is one

146
00:06:15,100 --> 00:06:17,440
thing I can honestly say as a blue team

147
00:06:17,440 --> 00:06:20,800
or defender who also participates in a

148
00:06:20,800 --> 00:06:23,110
bug bounty program is that my job is to

149
00:06:23,110 --> 00:06:24,850
make sure that the easy stuff doesn't

150
00:06:24,850 --> 00:06:27,970
slip by that's my job it is very

151
00:06:27,970 --> 00:06:30,400
rewarding when I find more complicated

152
00:06:30,400 --> 00:06:32,710
stuff but that is also why we run a bug

153
00:06:32,710 --> 00:06:35,080
bounty program so when people find

154
00:06:35,080 --> 00:06:37,120
something that's super obscure

155
00:06:37,120 --> 00:06:38,919
takes five different chained attacks

156
00:06:38,919 --> 00:06:40,300
that's amazing that means our binary

157
00:06:40,300 --> 00:06:43,020
programs working was that my job to find

158
00:06:43,020 --> 00:06:46,419
probably not like that within of two or

159
00:06:46,419 --> 00:06:47,860
three days of doing a review or a week

160
00:06:47,860 --> 00:06:49,930
or whatever it is yeah it's not gonna be

161
00:06:49,930 --> 00:06:52,990
what I what I do so I think that that's

162
00:06:52,990 --> 00:06:54,580
important because it sets off the tone

163
00:06:54,580 --> 00:06:56,710
of the entire rest of this sort of like

164
00:06:56,710 --> 00:06:58,380
methodology that we're gonna go through

165
00:06:58,380 --> 00:07:01,180
and as I said you want to add anything

166
00:07:01,180 --> 00:07:03,850
to that yeah I mean the points are up on

167
00:07:03,850 --> 00:07:06,280
the screen realistically the the reason

168
00:07:06,280 --> 00:07:08,320
that Ken and I actually started this

169
00:07:08,320 --> 00:07:09,790
course is because we found kind of a

170
00:07:09,790 --> 00:07:12,940
dearth of information about how people

171
00:07:12,940 --> 00:07:15,520
were conducting code reviews right

172
00:07:15,520 --> 00:07:17,919
there's a lot of information on Java

173
00:07:17,919 --> 00:07:20,889
secure coding or dotnet secure coding or

174
00:07:20,889 --> 00:07:22,900
you know secure coding in a specific

175
00:07:22,900 --> 00:07:24,460
language but not the general approach

176
00:07:24,460 --> 00:07:27,780
that we as security practitioners use in

177
00:07:27,780 --> 00:07:31,320
approaching a you know any code base

178
00:07:31,320 --> 00:07:35,290
most likely and your you know job you're

179
00:07:35,290 --> 00:07:37,690
not going to be only exposed to one

180
00:07:37,690 --> 00:07:41,169
specific language or framework and these

181
00:07:41,169 --> 00:07:42,520
are the lessons that Ken and I learned

182
00:07:42,520 --> 00:07:44,560
over the last ten to fifteen years in

183
00:07:44,560 --> 00:07:46,900
dealing with languages number one that

184
00:07:46,900 --> 00:07:48,490
we had never seen before as new stuff

185
00:07:48,490 --> 00:07:50,530
pops up number two and like do

186
00:07:50,530 --> 00:07:52,419
frameworks as they come in into a

187
00:07:52,419 --> 00:07:56,160
language that you already know and the

188
00:07:56,160 --> 00:07:58,510
systematic approach that we built to

189
00:07:58,510 --> 00:08:00,520
actually find bugs so we're not trying

190
00:08:00,520 --> 00:08:02,580
to find everything we're trying to find

191
00:08:02,580 --> 00:08:05,530
the high value and the easy stuff that

192
00:08:05,530 --> 00:08:07,690
should not go out the door I mean we're

193
00:08:07,690 --> 00:08:08,800
talking about things like sequel

194
00:08:08,800 --> 00:08:11,440
injection right like we all know that

195
00:08:11,440 --> 00:08:12,550
that's been a problem it's been around

196
00:08:12,550 --> 00:08:14,080
for a long time we're not looking for

197
00:08:14,080 --> 00:08:15,520
the edge cases on sequel injection

198
00:08:15,520 --> 00:08:17,889
unless we have the time but most likely

199
00:08:17,889 --> 00:08:19,539
we're looking for the easy stuff the

200
00:08:19,539 --> 00:08:21,190
string concatenation the other things

201
00:08:21,190 --> 00:08:23,860
that may or may be a problem that we

202
00:08:23,860 --> 00:08:25,330
know about we know how to find and we

203
00:08:25,330 --> 00:08:27,789
can find quickly and have a high impact

204
00:08:27,789 --> 00:08:31,450
of or a high assurance of security with

205
00:08:31,450 --> 00:08:33,070
that code base and I know I'm getting

206
00:08:33,070 --> 00:08:34,900
ahead of myself a little bit Ken but you

207
00:08:34,900 --> 00:08:36,400
know that's that's realistically where

208
00:08:36,400 --> 00:08:38,979
the floss we came from yeah no no not at

209
00:08:38,979 --> 00:08:39,219
all

210
00:08:39,219 --> 00:08:41,770
and in terms of like the you see the bit

211
00:08:41,770 --> 00:08:43,659
there about language agnostic principles

212
00:08:43,659 --> 00:08:46,570
we the thing is what we're going to show

213
00:08:46,570 --> 00:08:49,510
you is basically how to become an expert

214
00:08:49,510 --> 00:08:50,270
at

215
00:08:50,270 --> 00:08:52,460
whatever you're tasked with you may not

216
00:08:52,460 --> 00:08:53,660
know the language and framework you're

217
00:08:53,660 --> 00:08:55,910
dealing with so the goal is to like get

218
00:08:55,910 --> 00:08:57,860
up to speed as quickly as possible on

219
00:08:57,860 --> 00:09:01,310
that and then be able to assess based

220
00:09:01,310 --> 00:09:03,530
off of sort of this approach that we're

221
00:09:03,530 --> 00:09:06,700
going to show you feel confident rather

222
00:09:06,700 --> 00:09:09,320
confident and competent know you're

223
00:09:09,320 --> 00:09:12,050
competent when you review whatever it

224
00:09:12,050 --> 00:09:14,210
might might whatever might pop up I've

225
00:09:14,210 --> 00:09:16,010
just dealt with a lot of things the

226
00:09:16,010 --> 00:09:17,720
recently that I had never dealt with

227
00:09:17,720 --> 00:09:20,680
before but again following this approach

228
00:09:20,680 --> 00:09:24,200
um hit the wrong thing here following

229
00:09:24,200 --> 00:09:25,400
this approach it actually helped us

230
00:09:25,400 --> 00:09:29,480
helped out quite a bit so our experience

231
00:09:29,480 --> 00:09:30,770
and stories and the interactive

232
00:09:30,770 --> 00:09:31,910
exercises and all that stuff that's

233
00:09:31,910 --> 00:09:33,580
getting cut out really this is all about

234
00:09:33,580 --> 00:09:36,470
trying to minimize for an hour we're

235
00:09:36,470 --> 00:09:38,630
gonna go right into d8 like code review

236
00:09:38,630 --> 00:09:41,900
bits here so everything that we talked

237
00:09:41,900 --> 00:09:43,700
about it all comes back to what we've

238
00:09:43,700 --> 00:09:45,890
jokingly called the Circle K framework

239
00:09:45,890 --> 00:09:47,900
if you don't get the reference it's Bill

240
00:09:47,900 --> 00:09:50,000
and Ted's Excellent Adventure related so

241
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:51,770
that's why we call it that a lot of our

242
00:09:51,770 --> 00:09:54,470
stuff is obscure these references but

243
00:09:54,470 --> 00:09:55,430
that's why we called the Circle K

244
00:09:55,430 --> 00:09:57,260
framework whatever you do you always

245
00:09:57,260 --> 00:10:00,080
come back to this really I think that

246
00:10:00,080 --> 00:10:01,670
the first one's easy you open in a file

247
00:10:01,670 --> 00:10:02,480
in take you know that's right which

248
00:10:02,480 --> 00:10:05,050
we're actually gonna show you how to

249
00:10:05,050 --> 00:10:08,060
write notes like how to take how to get

250
00:10:08,060 --> 00:10:09,710
your notes up to snuff like how to get

251
00:10:09,710 --> 00:10:12,890
them to the park where or to the point

252
00:10:12,890 --> 00:10:15,470
where you feel like you've done a

253
00:10:15,470 --> 00:10:17,600
comprehensive review and you've given

254
00:10:17,600 --> 00:10:19,910
everybody else good information on what

255
00:10:19,910 --> 00:10:23,000
has been assessed but to do that you you

256
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:24,530
need to get to know the application you

257
00:10:24,530 --> 00:10:27,230
need to map the application brainstorm

258
00:10:27,230 --> 00:10:29,150
risks we're gonna talk about that and

259
00:10:29,150 --> 00:10:32,060
why you need other people to do that you

260
00:10:32,060 --> 00:10:34,850
this is not a solitary thing these code

261
00:10:34,850 --> 00:10:36,740
reviews you need other people that's for

262
00:10:36,740 --> 00:10:37,670
sure

263
00:10:37,670 --> 00:10:39,350
build your list of things based off of

264
00:10:39,350 --> 00:10:40,820
the brainstorming and based off of

265
00:10:40,820 --> 00:10:42,470
understanding the technology stack and

266
00:10:42,470 --> 00:10:43,730
all that you're gonna build your list of

267
00:10:43,730 --> 00:10:46,190
review de review items perform all of

268
00:10:46,190 --> 00:10:48,110
the reviews but this number seven is

269
00:10:48,110 --> 00:10:49,610
like my favorite thing to really talk

270
00:10:49,610 --> 00:10:51,950
about steps 3 through 6 you're gonna

271
00:10:51,950 --> 00:10:56,450
redo and the reason for that is well

272
00:10:56,450 --> 00:10:58,580
we're gonna shoot I think in this one we

273
00:10:58,580 --> 00:11:00,770
do share an example of like a story

274
00:11:00,770 --> 00:11:03,350
about this but it's always a good idea

275
00:11:03,350 --> 00:11:04,190
to go back

276
00:11:04,190 --> 00:11:05,829
and just make sure that you've

277
00:11:05,829 --> 00:11:09,829
double-checked everything and you've

278
00:11:09,829 --> 00:11:11,060
made sure that you've thought of

279
00:11:11,060 --> 00:11:14,240
everything as well yeah it's not a that

280
00:11:14,240 --> 00:11:18,259
I go back one slide second the like the

281
00:11:18,259 --> 00:11:20,060
framework itself and more if you refer

282
00:11:20,060 --> 00:11:21,529
back to this we'll share this slides out

283
00:11:21,529 --> 00:11:23,689
as well Sam and we can post them in

284
00:11:23,689 --> 00:11:25,129
slack or whatever you want to when we

285
00:11:25,129 --> 00:11:27,829
get done with this the issue here is

286
00:11:27,829 --> 00:11:29,930
that it's not a you know this isn't a

287
00:11:29,930 --> 00:11:34,100
single single item framework like when

288
00:11:34,100 --> 00:11:36,259
you get done with this you can be fairly

289
00:11:36,259 --> 00:11:38,240
confident that you've you've covered the

290
00:11:38,240 --> 00:11:40,519
items that you initially brainstormed

291
00:11:40,519 --> 00:11:42,649
but the problem is is you perform

292
00:11:42,649 --> 00:11:45,199
reviews more risks pop up as you talk to

293
00:11:45,199 --> 00:11:46,459
other people as you get to know the

294
00:11:46,459 --> 00:11:47,990
codebase even better than you did when

295
00:11:47,990 --> 00:11:50,300
you initially mapped the application so

296
00:11:50,300 --> 00:11:53,060
we've got to repeat things at least a

297
00:11:53,060 --> 00:11:54,889
couple of times to be fairly confident

298
00:11:54,889 --> 00:11:56,180
that we've that we've at least

299
00:11:56,180 --> 00:11:58,069
identified the approach that the

300
00:11:58,069 --> 00:11:59,569
application takes to the different

301
00:11:59,569 --> 00:12:01,189
components right whether it's

302
00:12:01,189 --> 00:12:02,930
authentication or authorization the

303
00:12:02,930 --> 00:12:03,800
different things that we're going to

304
00:12:03,800 --> 00:12:07,370
talk about but the more that we learn

305
00:12:07,370 --> 00:12:09,589
about the application the better we're

306
00:12:09,589 --> 00:12:11,480
gonna be at brainstorming the risks of

307
00:12:11,480 --> 00:12:13,519
building review items and things that we

308
00:12:13,519 --> 00:12:15,980
should check so we've got it we've got

309
00:12:15,980 --> 00:12:17,720
to perform that last step at least a

310
00:12:17,720 --> 00:12:19,279
couple of times double back to make sure

311
00:12:19,279 --> 00:12:21,709
that we're we are confident in the

312
00:12:21,709 --> 00:12:24,259
review that we've done all right

313
00:12:24,259 --> 00:12:27,019
absolutely know absolutely everything

314
00:12:27,019 --> 00:12:32,540
you just said totally agree to do all

315
00:12:32,540 --> 00:12:32,930
right

316
00:12:32,930 --> 00:12:36,290
so there's several there's several

317
00:12:36,290 --> 00:12:39,980
different like kind of formats that you

318
00:12:39,980 --> 00:12:42,889
could think of there's the I once lived

319
00:12:42,889 --> 00:12:44,779
in this world which is you decide how

320
00:12:44,779 --> 00:12:46,310
much time you spend on an overview you

321
00:12:46,310 --> 00:12:48,290
scope it out and you get to take your

322
00:12:48,290 --> 00:12:51,079
time you do it until you feel like

323
00:12:51,079 --> 00:12:52,939
everything's been covered and you feel

324
00:12:52,939 --> 00:12:57,459
confident which is typically never right

325
00:12:57,459 --> 00:13:02,600
joking but that's sort of why we came up

326
00:13:02,600 --> 00:13:04,399
with this methodology is that we spend a

327
00:13:04,399 --> 00:13:07,180
lot of time churning cycles and like

328
00:13:07,180 --> 00:13:09,199
continually going and be like I don't

329
00:13:09,199 --> 00:13:10,279
know if I'm confident I don't know if

330
00:13:10,279 --> 00:13:11,660
I'm confident okay here's my review I

331
00:13:11,660 --> 00:13:13,850
hope I found everything and so at least

332
00:13:13,850 --> 00:13:15,769
this gives you a way to demonstrate what

333
00:13:15,769 --> 00:13:17,840
you reviewed give you some sense of like

334
00:13:17,840 --> 00:13:23,390
confidence the the world that some

335
00:13:23,390 --> 00:13:25,490
people live in is that is you have no

336
00:13:25,490 --> 00:13:28,280
time at all you might have we this is

337
00:13:28,280 --> 00:13:29,600
the saddest thing by the way if you're a

338
00:13:29,600 --> 00:13:31,220
manager of a security team and we're

339
00:13:31,220 --> 00:13:33,710
litt you're listening we have definitely

340
00:13:33,710 --> 00:13:35,570
in every single one of our courses come

341
00:13:35,570 --> 00:13:38,900
across people who they are given like

342
00:13:38,900 --> 00:13:40,340
we'll say half a million lines of code

343
00:13:40,340 --> 00:13:43,310
just earn a number out there and their

344
00:13:43,310 --> 00:13:45,890
job is to run a scanner that's it like

345
00:13:45,890 --> 00:13:48,860
just take the code get it to if it needs

346
00:13:48,860 --> 00:13:50,600
to compile to run a scanner or whether

347
00:13:50,600 --> 00:13:52,220
or not you know whether or not like get

348
00:13:52,220 --> 00:13:54,020
it to the phase that it can be like scan

349
00:13:54,020 --> 00:13:57,080
scanning it tell it like go through

350
00:13:57,080 --> 00:13:59,420
those results and then do that within a

351
00:13:59,420 --> 00:14:03,440
day or two or three days that's just

352
00:14:03,440 --> 00:14:05,480
like if you're a manager listening and

353
00:14:05,480 --> 00:14:07,280
your team's doing that you're doing it

354
00:14:07,280 --> 00:14:09,260
incredibly wrong and if you'd like more

355
00:14:09,260 --> 00:14:11,840
information reach out as we we'd love to

356
00:14:11,840 --> 00:14:14,330
explain why and we're gonna talk a

357
00:14:14,330 --> 00:14:15,650
little bit about hopefully this this

358
00:14:15,650 --> 00:14:19,160
presentation kind of does help you

359
00:14:19,160 --> 00:14:21,770
understand why but yeah like don't do

360
00:14:21,770 --> 00:14:23,390
that period I hate it

361
00:14:23,390 --> 00:14:25,490
Seth it's not a good way to run your

362
00:14:25,490 --> 00:14:27,950
program I mean and that the thing is the

363
00:14:27,950 --> 00:14:29,180
thing you need to realize is both Ken

364
00:14:29,180 --> 00:14:31,790
and I have done that right like when we

365
00:14:31,790 --> 00:14:33,650
started doing secure code reviews that

366
00:14:33,650 --> 00:14:35,660
was the approach that was given to us is

367
00:14:35,660 --> 00:14:38,330
we were handed static analysis results

368
00:14:38,330 --> 00:14:39,980
and said okay you're doing a code review

369
00:14:39,980 --> 00:14:43,340
and at the time that became oh let's

370
00:14:43,340 --> 00:14:45,650
just run through all of these findings

371
00:14:45,650 --> 00:14:48,320
that come out of a scanner and you know

372
00:14:48,320 --> 00:14:50,510
try to eliminate the false positives and

373
00:14:50,510 --> 00:14:51,560
then you've run out of time and you

374
00:14:51,560 --> 00:14:52,850
actually haven't really looked at the

375
00:14:52,850 --> 00:14:55,130
code at all so but hence the reason that

376
00:14:55,130 --> 00:14:57,500
that you know we comes crossing that

377
00:14:57,500 --> 00:14:59,420
slide right none of these types means

378
00:14:59,420 --> 00:15:00,980
just run to scandalize or analyze the

379
00:15:00,980 --> 00:15:01,490
results

380
00:15:01,490 --> 00:15:03,620
you're better off actually analyzing the

381
00:15:03,620 --> 00:15:06,980
code itself then the scan results yeah

382
00:15:06,980 --> 00:15:09,500
yeah and I think most of us live in this

383
00:15:09,500 --> 00:15:11,630
life that lasts exactly what's that's

384
00:15:11,630 --> 00:15:15,140
mean you're better off doing yeah well

385
00:15:15,140 --> 00:15:18,110
we'll get into that though the last bit

386
00:15:18,110 --> 00:15:19,520
here's where we probably most of us live

387
00:15:19,520 --> 00:15:22,010
which is like you have some amount of

388
00:15:22,010 --> 00:15:24,050
time maybe you get to scope at least say

389
00:15:24,050 --> 00:15:27,290
like what's reasonable you know maybe

390
00:15:27,290 --> 00:15:28,670
you know that like 40 hours is fine

391
00:15:28,670 --> 00:15:31,310
whatever whatever it is and you know you

392
00:15:31,310 --> 00:15:36,950
do your best and that's what getting it

393
00:15:36,950 --> 00:15:42,020
to optimizing and efficient all right so

394
00:15:42,020 --> 00:15:44,840
what we're going to talk about are this

395
00:15:44,840 --> 00:15:46,040
is sort of what we're doing at a high

396
00:15:46,040 --> 00:15:47,870
level a lot of this stuff is we had to

397
00:15:47,870 --> 00:15:49,430
we're not doing it so it's crossed out

398
00:15:49,430 --> 00:15:51,800
but we're gonna show you what alert look

399
00:15:51,800 --> 00:15:53,720
how to do that like how do you find

400
00:15:53,720 --> 00:15:56,390
source to sink just we're gonna talk

401
00:15:56,390 --> 00:15:58,970
about like how you kind of profile an

402
00:15:58,970 --> 00:16:02,050
application we're gonna talk about

403
00:16:02,050 --> 00:16:05,660
general bones that kind of crop up in

404
00:16:05,660 --> 00:16:09,740
different sections of an app and what

405
00:16:09,740 --> 00:16:11,540
we're not gonna do is we're not gonna

406
00:16:11,540 --> 00:16:13,520
teach to the OS top ten we're not gonna

407
00:16:13,520 --> 00:16:16,970
talk about like you know here's all like

408
00:16:16,970 --> 00:16:18,650
here here's an explanation on these

409
00:16:18,650 --> 00:16:20,180
various web vulnerabilities like here's

410
00:16:20,180 --> 00:16:22,190
how see Cerf works that's our assumption

411
00:16:22,190 --> 00:16:23,810
is you if you're watching this you

412
00:16:23,810 --> 00:16:27,080
probably know that or you there's other

413
00:16:27,080 --> 00:16:29,720
episodes on this pod on the secure

414
00:16:29,720 --> 00:16:32,090
developer podcast that you that maybe

415
00:16:32,090 --> 00:16:34,100
cover that there's resources out there

416
00:16:34,100 --> 00:16:38,300
it's not what this is about so with that

417
00:16:38,300 --> 00:16:41,290
in mind let's jump right into it

418
00:16:41,290 --> 00:16:43,700
alright so these are the steps and they

419
00:16:43,700 --> 00:16:47,390
are steps the majority of this

420
00:16:47,390 --> 00:16:49,400
presentations gonna be focused on those

421
00:16:49,400 --> 00:16:50,690
first two bullet points which is

422
00:16:50,690 --> 00:16:52,460
application overview and risk assessment

423
00:16:52,460 --> 00:16:54,290
and information gathering but there's a

424
00:16:54,290 --> 00:16:55,640
lot in there including more like

425
00:16:55,640 --> 00:16:57,080
note-taking and what we're looking for

426
00:16:57,080 --> 00:16:59,210
and how to map an application and stuff

427
00:16:59,210 --> 00:17:04,069
like that general concepts one thing we

428
00:17:04,069 --> 00:17:06,500
talk about every single times like we do

429
00:17:06,500 --> 00:17:08,060
I'm not gonna go on like a tangent here

430
00:17:08,060 --> 00:17:12,349
but give yourself flow time I like to

431
00:17:12,349 --> 00:17:15,470
call it like flow time the reason is is

432
00:17:15,470 --> 00:17:17,750
when you're in a state of flow like time

433
00:17:17,750 --> 00:17:21,290
passes okay but in reality it time

434
00:17:21,290 --> 00:17:22,339
passes without you really paying

435
00:17:22,339 --> 00:17:25,220
attention but in reality when we do

436
00:17:25,220 --> 00:17:26,930
these code reviews for mice you have to

437
00:17:26,930 --> 00:17:29,540
find your limit but for myself about two

438
00:17:29,540 --> 00:17:31,910
to three hours of focus work is about

439
00:17:31,910 --> 00:17:33,560
all I can handle before I need a good

440
00:17:33,560 --> 00:17:38,840
break so at at usually I'll give myself

441
00:17:38,840 --> 00:17:41,360
like two hours of super focused work and

442
00:17:41,360 --> 00:17:44,370
then I do something else and I come back

443
00:17:44,370 --> 00:17:47,100
and the reason is in mind and you are

444
00:17:47,100 --> 00:17:50,070
just sort of like going until this you

445
00:17:50,070 --> 00:17:52,080
start finding yourself like trying to

446
00:17:52,080 --> 00:17:54,540
multitask maybe check email face when

447
00:17:54,540 --> 00:17:56,220
you find yourself doing that you're out

448
00:17:56,220 --> 00:18:04,200
of your state of flow so you need to can

449
00:18:04,200 --> 00:18:07,890
did we go into a review is just as

450
00:18:07,890 --> 00:18:10,160
important as like the actual review

451
00:18:10,160 --> 00:18:13,410
components and steps and note-taking all

452
00:18:13,410 --> 00:18:15,930
those things yeah and as far as don't

453
00:18:15,930 --> 00:18:17,970
making it personal that goes you know

454
00:18:17,970 --> 00:18:19,890
don't make it personal to yourself or to

455
00:18:19,890 --> 00:18:22,620
the developers on the other side like so

456
00:18:22,620 --> 00:18:23,820
we can talk about the report at the end

457
00:18:23,820 --> 00:18:25,140
and like how you don't want to be

458
00:18:25,140 --> 00:18:27,180
antagonistic to the developers because

459
00:18:27,180 --> 00:18:29,490
you know that's never a good situation

460
00:18:29,490 --> 00:18:31,560
to be in but also don't make it personal

461
00:18:31,560 --> 00:18:34,230
to yourself the thing that you have to

462
00:18:34,230 --> 00:18:35,700
realize is everyone goes through that

463
00:18:35,700 --> 00:18:37,890
same cycle where they they start with an

464
00:18:37,890 --> 00:18:39,450
application they start looking at code

465
00:18:39,450 --> 00:18:41,250
or they start doing a penetration test

466
00:18:41,250 --> 00:18:43,200
and they think at first crap I'm like

467
00:18:43,200 --> 00:18:45,180
awesome I'm finding all this stuff and

468
00:18:45,180 --> 00:18:48,030
then they realize you know they may jump

469
00:18:48,030 --> 00:18:49,410
down the rabbit hole we're gonna talk a

470
00:18:49,410 --> 00:18:51,180
lot about radicals and how we need to

471
00:18:51,180 --> 00:18:53,610
avoid them here today but they jump down

472
00:18:53,610 --> 00:18:56,430
the rabbit hole too soon and then they

473
00:18:56,430 --> 00:18:58,050
kind of hit up against a limit okay

474
00:18:58,050 --> 00:18:59,910
where they don't actually they can't

475
00:18:59,910 --> 00:19:01,380
seem to find anything else and they've

476
00:19:01,380 --> 00:19:03,150
got to go back and basically start over

477
00:19:03,150 --> 00:19:04,530
hence the reason that we have the

478
00:19:04,530 --> 00:19:06,300
methodology and we have that circle-k

479
00:19:06,300 --> 00:19:08,490
framework that we've come up with is so

480
00:19:08,490 --> 00:19:10,470
that you have something to go back to

481
00:19:10,470 --> 00:19:13,110
when nothing else seems to work it's

482
00:19:13,110 --> 00:19:14,940
really easy to beat yourself up and say

483
00:19:14,940 --> 00:19:17,640
crap like I'm in the wrong industry I'm

484
00:19:17,640 --> 00:19:19,560
doing the wrong thing because I can't

485
00:19:19,560 --> 00:19:21,030
seem to find these vulnerabilities that

486
00:19:21,030 --> 00:19:22,560
everybody else seems to think that they

487
00:19:22,560 --> 00:19:25,140
can find or seems to find even though

488
00:19:25,140 --> 00:19:27,270
you don't you don't necessarily see how

489
00:19:27,270 --> 00:19:28,770
much time it actually takes to do this

490
00:19:28,770 --> 00:19:31,080
you know as someone that does this on a

491
00:19:31,080 --> 00:19:32,340
daily basis I can't tell you the number

492
00:19:32,340 --> 00:19:33,510
of times that I talk to people that

493
00:19:33,510 --> 00:19:34,650
aren't in the industry and they're like

494
00:19:34,650 --> 00:19:37,170
man I'd really like to see what you do

495
00:19:37,170 --> 00:19:39,150
on a daily basis right I'd like to sit

496
00:19:39,150 --> 00:19:41,190
and watch over your shoulder and I'm

497
00:19:41,190 --> 00:19:43,560
constantly telling him no you really

498
00:19:43,560 --> 00:19:45,750
don't right it is the most boring thing

499
00:19:45,750 --> 00:19:48,290
to look at like me reviewing code

500
00:19:48,290 --> 00:19:50,850
because the amount of time that I spend

501
00:19:50,850 --> 00:19:53,340
actually reviewing things and going down

502
00:19:53,340 --> 00:19:55,110
paths that don't end up in a

503
00:19:55,110 --> 00:19:57,669
vulnerability is probably the majority

504
00:19:57,669 --> 00:19:59,979
of what I do and this is where you can't

505
00:19:59,979 --> 00:20:01,450
make it personal just because there's

506
00:20:01,450 --> 00:20:03,519
not a vulnerability in that code doesn't

507
00:20:03,519 --> 00:20:05,169
mean that you're not good at actually

508
00:20:05,169 --> 00:20:07,509
identifying vulnerabilities and code it

509
00:20:07,509 --> 00:20:09,039
means that the developers have actually

510
00:20:09,039 --> 00:20:11,499
done what you want them to do so you

511
00:20:11,499 --> 00:20:13,059
can't make it personal you can't you

512
00:20:13,059 --> 00:20:15,489
know attack yourself but having the

513
00:20:15,489 --> 00:20:16,989
framework gives you the ability to be

514
00:20:16,989 --> 00:20:18,489
like okay all right

515
00:20:18,489 --> 00:20:19,839
there was nothing in authentication

516
00:20:19,839 --> 00:20:21,669
let's go back and let's look at the next

517
00:20:21,669 --> 00:20:23,019
thing let's look at everything else

518
00:20:23,019 --> 00:20:24,639
that's there and give the give the

519
00:20:24,639 --> 00:20:26,349
developers the kudos that they deserve

520
00:20:26,349 --> 00:20:28,149
when you are actually reviewing that

521
00:20:28,149 --> 00:20:31,509
code as far as the other code review

522
00:20:31,509 --> 00:20:32,950
principles that are in there ask

523
00:20:32,950 --> 00:20:35,349
questions make sure that the developers

524
00:20:35,349 --> 00:20:37,839
are your friends right if you can't

525
00:20:37,839 --> 00:20:40,089
actually ask them questions it's gonna

526
00:20:40,089 --> 00:20:41,649
be very difficult to make it through a

527
00:20:41,649 --> 00:20:42,909
code review in the amount of time that

528
00:20:42,909 --> 00:20:47,649
you have now we've started standardizing

529
00:20:47,649 --> 00:20:49,779
inside of github that the first thing

530
00:20:49,779 --> 00:20:51,759
you do is you actually hop on us very

531
00:20:51,759 --> 00:20:54,369
quick 15-minute if need-be zoom chat

532
00:20:54,369 --> 00:20:59,200
with develop the developer of whatever

533
00:20:59,200 --> 00:21:01,119
you're reviewing feature new app

534
00:21:01,119 --> 00:21:04,989
whatever it is to get an idea of like

535
00:21:04,989 --> 00:21:07,029
the app to ask the questions what are

536
00:21:07,029 --> 00:21:08,469
you concerned with which I think usually

537
00:21:08,469 --> 00:21:11,679
discuss that yeah yeah and then that's

538
00:21:11,679 --> 00:21:14,289
where I was gonna go is like one of the

539
00:21:14,289 --> 00:21:15,549
first things I learned is being a

540
00:21:15,549 --> 00:21:17,349
consultant is going into do like an

541
00:21:17,349 --> 00:21:18,879
architecture review of an application

542
00:21:18,879 --> 00:21:21,940
and you know we'd sit down and we've

543
00:21:21,940 --> 00:21:23,709
talked to the different stakeholders

544
00:21:23,709 --> 00:21:25,839
with the application and I got to the

545
00:21:25,839 --> 00:21:28,089
developer at the very end and just

546
00:21:28,089 --> 00:21:30,249
happened to ask this question is I'm

547
00:21:30,249 --> 00:21:32,919
like hey so what is it that you're

548
00:21:32,919 --> 00:21:36,369
concerned about right and like he

549
00:21:36,369 --> 00:21:37,869
pointed me at three different

550
00:21:37,869 --> 00:21:40,239
vulnerabilities in the code that he

551
00:21:40,239 --> 00:21:42,549
already knew about that he wanted to

552
00:21:42,549 --> 00:21:44,349
have fixed but the management hadn't

553
00:21:44,349 --> 00:21:46,089
give him given him the opportunity to

554
00:21:46,089 --> 00:21:47,649
actually go back and do that I mean

555
00:21:47,649 --> 00:21:49,989
basically he wrote the report format for

556
00:21:49,989 --> 00:21:52,329
me because he called out these different

557
00:21:52,329 --> 00:21:54,549
things that yeah I could have found in

558
00:21:54,549 --> 00:21:56,469
the amount of time like in the two weeks

559
00:21:56,469 --> 00:21:58,719
that I had there but I may have missed

560
00:21:58,719 --> 00:22:00,399
one or two of them if I hadn't have

561
00:22:00,399 --> 00:22:02,320
asked the question what is it that

562
00:22:02,320 --> 00:22:04,179
you're concerned about as the developer

563
00:22:04,179 --> 00:22:05,709
of the application they know it better

564
00:22:05,709 --> 00:22:07,329
than you do and they're gonna have a

565
00:22:07,329 --> 00:22:08,589
better idea of where those

566
00:22:08,589 --> 00:22:11,260
vulnerabilities exist the other thing

567
00:22:11,260 --> 00:22:14,559
I did a record review this was a couple

568
00:22:14,559 --> 00:22:17,230
years ago for an online system we were

569
00:22:17,230 --> 00:22:19,000
digging through it and I happened to you

570
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:19,990
know find a sequel injection

571
00:22:19,990 --> 00:22:22,720
vulnerability and the second that I

572
00:22:22,720 --> 00:22:24,720
brought it up with the development team

573
00:22:24,720 --> 00:22:26,980
before I even told them where it was I

574
00:22:26,980 --> 00:22:28,299
was like hey guys I found sequel

575
00:22:28,299 --> 00:22:30,429
injection they're like oh was it in this

576
00:22:30,429 --> 00:22:34,179
web service I was like yes it actually

577
00:22:34,179 --> 00:22:35,919
was and they're like yeah that's old we

578
00:22:35,919 --> 00:22:37,960
know it's a problem we just haven't had

579
00:22:37,960 --> 00:22:40,270
time to get around to it so again like I

580
00:22:40,270 --> 00:22:43,030
could have short-circuited my findings

581
00:22:43,030 --> 00:22:45,370
by just talking to them first and saying

582
00:22:45,370 --> 00:22:47,530
hey guys you know what is it that you

583
00:22:47,530 --> 00:22:50,620
have concerns with so anyway ask

584
00:22:50,620 --> 00:22:52,900
questions talk to developers talk to the

585
00:22:52,900 --> 00:22:53,950
other people that have looked at the

586
00:22:53,950 --> 00:22:55,780
code that's gonna short-circuit and

587
00:22:55,780 --> 00:22:57,309
limit the amount of time that you're

588
00:22:57,309 --> 00:22:58,630
gonna have to do this information

589
00:22:58,630 --> 00:23:02,770
gathering and mapping yeah and with

590
00:23:02,770 --> 00:23:05,110
framework code documentation framework

591
00:23:05,110 --> 00:23:08,080
or code documentation I think we show

592
00:23:08,080 --> 00:23:09,820
some example syrup but basically like

593
00:23:09,820 --> 00:23:11,950
both that comes down to is you should be

594
00:23:11,950 --> 00:23:13,990
if you're if you're looking at the

595
00:23:13,990 --> 00:23:16,210
Django framework maybe take a gander at

596
00:23:16,210 --> 00:23:18,760
the Django security information that's

597
00:23:18,760 --> 00:23:21,880
available out there if you're looking at

598
00:23:21,880 --> 00:23:24,580
code there's typically at least you know

599
00:23:24,580 --> 00:23:27,549
not for everyone obviously but for a lot

600
00:23:27,549 --> 00:23:30,640
of our repos we've got doxxed folders

601
00:23:30,640 --> 00:23:32,950
inside the code repository where we can

602
00:23:32,950 --> 00:23:35,410
look through and see whatever you know

603
00:23:35,410 --> 00:23:38,169
UML or whatever diagrams have been style

604
00:23:38,169 --> 00:23:40,000
of diagrams been drafted and the

605
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:41,350
information some people have like

606
00:23:41,350 --> 00:23:42,970
swagger

607
00:23:42,970 --> 00:23:48,540
what is it the swagger a yeah

608
00:23:48,540 --> 00:23:51,190
is it Jason I can't remember what format

609
00:23:51,190 --> 00:23:54,820
it is yeah which documents like each API

610
00:23:54,820 --> 00:23:56,740
endpoint and like what parameters it

611
00:23:56,740 --> 00:23:59,290
takes and stuff like that yeah I mean

612
00:23:59,290 --> 00:24:01,240
just like just like the other developers

613
00:24:01,240 --> 00:24:03,309
you know or a good resource that any

614
00:24:03,309 --> 00:24:04,870
code documentation or framework

615
00:24:04,870 --> 00:24:06,370
documentation is going to give you a lot

616
00:24:06,370 --> 00:24:08,169
of pointers on where to go and that's

617
00:24:08,169 --> 00:24:09,400
what we're looking at is we're trying to

618
00:24:09,400 --> 00:24:10,540
short-circuit the amount of time it

619
00:24:10,540 --> 00:24:13,210
takes that we look at code so yeah we'll

620
00:24:13,210 --> 00:24:14,410
get into this more in the information

621
00:24:14,410 --> 00:24:16,660
gathering phase building the code

622
00:24:16,660 --> 00:24:18,460
running the test this makes this just

623
00:24:18,460 --> 00:24:20,140
ensures that we actually have all the

624
00:24:20,140 --> 00:24:22,450
code that we need to do the review on

625
00:24:22,450 --> 00:24:23,980
both of those fronts and we'll talk a

626
00:24:23,980 --> 00:24:24,440
little bit

627
00:24:24,440 --> 00:24:27,710
more about that shortly yeah I'm gonna I

628
00:24:27,710 --> 00:24:29,540
think I'm gonna skip this section and

629
00:24:29,540 --> 00:24:31,190
well basically like what happens if you

630
00:24:31,190 --> 00:24:33,020
have to millions of lines of code and no

631
00:24:33,020 --> 00:24:34,760
time to look at it we'll get into that

632
00:24:34,760 --> 00:24:36,110
because you still have to fault this

633
00:24:36,110 --> 00:24:39,130
methodology that's basically the gist

634
00:24:39,130 --> 00:24:41,420
all right so application overview and

635
00:24:41,420 --> 00:24:44,060
risk assessment so what you need to do

636
00:24:44,060 --> 00:24:46,190
first before you even start looking at

637
00:24:46,190 --> 00:24:48,020
and before you really start getting into

638
00:24:48,020 --> 00:24:49,850
code what you need to do is figure out a

639
00:24:49,850 --> 00:24:51,860
few things the behavior of the

640
00:24:51,860 --> 00:24:54,260
application we're gonna show you think

641
00:24:54,260 --> 00:24:55,700
five or six different things that like

642
00:24:55,700 --> 00:24:57,910
you need some questions you need to ask

643
00:24:57,910 --> 00:25:00,770
technology stack and I like your little

644
00:25:00,770 --> 00:25:03,110
app Arcot archaeology why that's kind of

645
00:25:03,110 --> 00:25:04,850
fun is sometimes you go through like say

646
00:25:04,850 --> 00:25:10,160
here you're going through a git log and

647
00:25:10,160 --> 00:25:11,750
just looking at like the commit history

648
00:25:11,750 --> 00:25:13,280
sometimes you'll actually see some

649
00:25:13,280 --> 00:25:15,380
pretty interesting commit messages if

650
00:25:15,380 --> 00:25:17,330
they say things like you know fixing

651
00:25:17,330 --> 00:25:19,370
this weird security thing someone talked

652
00:25:19,370 --> 00:25:22,160
about or something along those lines

653
00:25:22,160 --> 00:25:23,990
it's always kind of fun to write

654
00:25:23,990 --> 00:25:26,840
removing AWS keys from the repo you know

655
00:25:26,840 --> 00:25:30,620
yeah silly stuff like that which is kind

656
00:25:30,620 --> 00:25:32,810
of fun and and also you get to see you

657
00:25:32,810 --> 00:25:34,490
in like major functionality he's been

658
00:25:34,490 --> 00:25:36,560
added and there's all kinds of cool

659
00:25:36,560 --> 00:25:38,510
things you can look at like the list of

660
00:25:38,510 --> 00:25:41,420
pull requests or issues closed and open

661
00:25:41,420 --> 00:25:43,010
to get an idea of what's all been

662
00:25:43,010 --> 00:25:45,200
tackled I could do that just because

663
00:25:45,200 --> 00:25:46,490
it's like it's almost like when I say

664
00:25:46,490 --> 00:25:47,900
profiling it's almost like an FBI

665
00:25:47,900 --> 00:25:50,180
profiler looks at a person we do that

666
00:25:50,180 --> 00:25:53,360
for applications before we start really

667
00:25:53,360 --> 00:25:54,860
digging in because we need to kind of

668
00:25:54,860 --> 00:25:57,820
get an idea what this thing does and and

669
00:25:57,820 --> 00:26:00,800
that's part of the behavior profiling

670
00:26:00,800 --> 00:26:02,450
checklist that we just you know I just

671
00:26:02,450 --> 00:26:03,530
mentioned that we're gonna talk about

672
00:26:03,530 --> 00:26:05,030
which is like what does it do what's the

673
00:26:05,030 --> 00:26:07,040
business purpose who's it for what's the

674
00:26:07,040 --> 00:26:08,890
customer base look like

675
00:26:08,890 --> 00:26:12,410
internal/external both that's obviously

676
00:26:12,410 --> 00:26:13,940
gonna like if you have something that

677
00:26:13,940 --> 00:26:16,640
has an administrative interface and but

678
00:26:16,640 --> 00:26:18,740
you know it's open to the public

679
00:26:18,740 --> 00:26:22,520
and you have both your company users and

680
00:26:22,520 --> 00:26:24,500
you know external users on the same

681
00:26:24,500 --> 00:26:27,470
system it's all all in the same system

682
00:26:27,470 --> 00:26:28,940
and there might be some different

683
00:26:28,940 --> 00:26:30,980
concerns there than an application that

684
00:26:30,980 --> 00:26:34,400
has maybe maybe a the users are you know

685
00:26:34,400 --> 00:26:36,440
it's just a external users and it

686
00:26:36,440 --> 00:26:37,820
doesn't even do anything that

687
00:26:37,820 --> 00:26:40,090
scary like it doesn't hold that

688
00:26:40,090 --> 00:26:42,649
interesting of information which is the

689
00:26:42,649 --> 00:26:44,179
third bullet point what kind of

690
00:26:44,179 --> 00:26:45,679
information does it hold like that's

691
00:26:45,679 --> 00:26:47,989
super important to know what's the risk

692
00:26:47,989 --> 00:26:50,600
that we're talking about like if you're

693
00:26:50,600 --> 00:26:53,929
holding will say sensitive keys or

694
00:26:53,929 --> 00:26:55,729
personal information or whatever the

695
00:26:55,729 --> 00:26:57,979
case is it's a good idea to ask the

696
00:26:57,979 --> 00:27:00,019
developers like how are they doing that

697
00:27:00,019 --> 00:27:01,850
when you have those initial discussions

698
00:27:01,850 --> 00:27:04,129
like does that concern them what what

699
00:27:04,129 --> 00:27:08,239
parts concern them again like combining

700
00:27:08,239 --> 00:27:09,200
sort of what we talked about when we

701
00:27:09,200 --> 00:27:11,659
stood asking questions with and reading

702
00:27:11,659 --> 00:27:14,690
documentation with this bit and one of

703
00:27:14,690 --> 00:27:16,129
the different type of rules that's that

704
00:27:16,129 --> 00:27:18,200
you know that's pretty common users

705
00:27:18,200 --> 00:27:20,690
admins everything in between authors

706
00:27:20,690 --> 00:27:23,509
whatever whatever permission ACL kind of

707
00:27:23,509 --> 00:27:26,269
thing or sorry uh role based access

708
00:27:26,269 --> 00:27:28,940
control exists if it does exist like you

709
00:27:28,940 --> 00:27:31,999
didn't know that and then of course this

710
00:27:31,999 --> 00:27:34,399
is where we go back to if you're talking

711
00:27:34,399 --> 00:27:35,869
to the developers if you're talking to

712
00:27:35,869 --> 00:27:38,269
the project managers or product managers

713
00:27:38,269 --> 00:27:41,690
or whoever is involved in these

714
00:27:41,690 --> 00:27:44,809
discussions that whoever wants this app

715
00:27:44,809 --> 00:27:47,840
assess you should definitely ask them

716
00:27:47,840 --> 00:27:50,330
what their biggest concerns are I just

717
00:27:50,330 --> 00:27:51,710
think that's incredibly important

718
00:27:51,710 --> 00:27:53,629
because you're gonna find like seth

719
00:27:53,629 --> 00:27:55,309
talked about a couple slides back that

720
00:27:55,309 --> 00:27:57,409
people are more aware of like what the

721
00:27:57,409 --> 00:28:00,669
risks are than you might think

722
00:28:01,369 --> 00:28:03,320
and then when we talk about so we talked

723
00:28:03,320 --> 00:28:05,659
about like I just to reiterate we got we

724
00:28:05,659 --> 00:28:06,950
had three bullet points behavior

725
00:28:06,950 --> 00:28:09,889
profiling technology like technology

726
00:28:09,889 --> 00:28:12,859
stack and then app archeology so this is

727
00:28:12,859 --> 00:28:15,440
the technology stack part first you need

728
00:28:15,440 --> 00:28:16,970
to know like the framework and the

729
00:28:16,970 --> 00:28:18,919
programming language that's if there's a

730
00:28:18,919 --> 00:28:21,080
framework used which there nine times

731
00:28:21,080 --> 00:28:23,929
out of ten in my case is a framework

732
00:28:23,929 --> 00:28:26,450
used like it might be for going it might

733
00:28:26,450 --> 00:28:29,590
be MUX for Python might be Django for

734
00:28:29,590 --> 00:28:32,779
Ruby it might be like Sinatra or rails

735
00:28:32,779 --> 00:28:33,859
or something like that

736
00:28:33,859 --> 00:28:37,099
for dotnet core like there's all kinds

737
00:28:37,099 --> 00:28:39,080
of things that exist out there but you

738
00:28:39,080 --> 00:28:40,220
need to know what you're dealing with

739
00:28:40,220 --> 00:28:42,919
and also you need to know what versions

740
00:28:42,919 --> 00:28:44,749
you're dealing with because that plays a

741
00:28:44,749 --> 00:28:47,509
huge huge part on all of this the

742
00:28:47,509 --> 00:28:49,759
security controls when you look at the

743
00:28:49,759 --> 00:28:51,500
documentation we talked about talking

744
00:28:51,500 --> 00:28:52,910
looking at the framework in language

745
00:28:52,910 --> 00:28:54,710
documentation when you look at those

746
00:28:54,710 --> 00:28:57,770
documentation they the documentation the

747
00:28:57,770 --> 00:28:59,900
recommendations or security concerns can

748
00:28:59,900 --> 00:29:03,230
vary incredibly like wildly between say

749
00:29:03,230 --> 00:29:05,900
one major version or even three minor

750
00:29:05,900 --> 00:29:07,760
versions so you just need to know like

751
00:29:07,760 --> 00:29:08,870
what version and then reference

752
00:29:08,870 --> 00:29:10,850
documentation that's applicable there

753
00:29:10,850 --> 00:29:13,010
but for now just figure out what you're

754
00:29:13,010 --> 00:29:15,380
working with what versions and that'll

755
00:29:15,380 --> 00:29:16,790
give you kind of like an idea where you

756
00:29:16,790 --> 00:29:18,980
need to go and look and a lot of this is

757
00:29:18,980 --> 00:29:21,620
gonna pop up later on to like I mean we

758
00:29:21,620 --> 00:29:24,940
won't get into configuration review but

759
00:29:24,940 --> 00:29:29,420
the the like the software that you pull

760
00:29:29,420 --> 00:29:31,130
in or that the developers pull into an

761
00:29:31,130 --> 00:29:33,380
application is very critical as far as

762
00:29:33,380 --> 00:29:36,170
the security of the application goes we

763
00:29:36,170 --> 00:29:38,540
see this all you know recently all of

764
00:29:38,540 --> 00:29:40,250
the third-party libraries that have been

765
00:29:40,250 --> 00:29:43,100
exploited so you need to know what the

766
00:29:43,100 --> 00:29:45,050
third party components are so if we go

767
00:29:45,050 --> 00:29:46,910
back to the code review principles one

768
00:29:46,910 --> 00:29:48,110
of them was that you want to build the

769
00:29:48,110 --> 00:29:50,300
source and this is so that would pull in

770
00:29:50,300 --> 00:29:52,550
all of the relevant libraries like we're

771
00:29:52,550 --> 00:29:53,990
talking about here as we're doing our

772
00:29:53,990 --> 00:29:55,820
technology stack and reviewing how the

773
00:29:55,820 --> 00:29:58,820
application is put together so that we

774
00:29:58,820 --> 00:30:01,940
know what's actually in use by that

775
00:30:01,940 --> 00:30:04,490
application if we don't if we don't

776
00:30:04,490 --> 00:30:06,500
build the application we could miss some

777
00:30:06,500 --> 00:30:08,570
important ruby gem or we couldn't we

778
00:30:08,570 --> 00:30:10,700
could miss some jar that would be pulled

779
00:30:10,700 --> 00:30:12,920
down that could have vulnerabilities in

780
00:30:12,920 --> 00:30:14,660
it that would affect that the security

781
00:30:14,660 --> 00:30:16,550
of the application so we need to know

782
00:30:16,550 --> 00:30:18,320
what those third-party components are we

783
00:30:18,320 --> 00:30:19,700
need to know what's being stored in them

784
00:30:19,700 --> 00:30:21,620
you can take a lot of time on this but

785
00:30:21,620 --> 00:30:22,670
you can take a little time it just

786
00:30:22,670 --> 00:30:23,900
depends on the complexity of the

787
00:30:23,900 --> 00:30:26,180
application obviously the data store is

788
00:30:26,180 --> 00:30:29,120
important as well just from an injection

789
00:30:29,120 --> 00:30:31,280
perspective like sequel injection versus

790
00:30:31,280 --> 00:30:33,440
no sequel injection or maybe it's just

791
00:30:33,440 --> 00:30:34,940
some sort of SSR F that you're going to

792
00:30:34,940 --> 00:30:36,860
be looking for but that's all going to

793
00:30:36,860 --> 00:30:39,740
play into the risks that we identify for

794
00:30:39,740 --> 00:30:41,120
the application and building out the

795
00:30:41,120 --> 00:30:43,040
checklist items that we want or to look

796
00:30:43,040 --> 00:30:47,990
at anything yeah it's at yeah to add to

797
00:30:47,990 --> 00:30:50,060
that like because like with with we

798
00:30:50,060 --> 00:30:51,950
mentioned JavaScript widgets for example

799
00:30:51,950 --> 00:30:53,840
there's different risks risks with these

800
00:30:53,840 --> 00:30:55,640
things so if you have like a sales chat

801
00:30:55,640 --> 00:30:57,410
widget for instance well now you know

802
00:30:57,410 --> 00:30:58,820
you probably need to be concerned at how

803
00:30:58,820 --> 00:31:01,220
like referrers are being handled right

804
00:31:01,220 --> 00:31:04,040
you might have sensitive URLs and that

805
00:31:04,040 --> 00:31:04,679
chat

806
00:31:04,679 --> 00:31:06,929
that cat which is like sending those

807
00:31:06,929 --> 00:31:09,059
sensitive whatever values are in the URL

808
00:31:09,059 --> 00:31:10,830
or like whatever the URL might like

809
00:31:10,830 --> 00:31:12,240
whatever data might be sensitive there

810
00:31:12,240 --> 00:31:14,220
if their widgets on every page it might

811
00:31:14,220 --> 00:31:15,899
be sending that off to it this third

812
00:31:15,899 --> 00:31:18,269
party saying this is why you need to

813
00:31:18,269 --> 00:31:19,619
know these things and like with web

814
00:31:19,619 --> 00:31:20,879
hooks you know there needs to be some

815
00:31:20,879 --> 00:31:23,159
sort of like authentication between the

816
00:31:23,159 --> 00:31:25,230
two which is something to write down hey

817
00:31:25,230 --> 00:31:27,600
look into the authentication of like web

818
00:31:27,600 --> 00:31:29,129
hooks you know are we doing some sort of

819
00:31:29,129 --> 00:31:31,409
H macking message integrity like how are

820
00:31:31,409 --> 00:31:33,899
you doing that and then like the you

821
00:31:33,899 --> 00:31:35,669
know the the yeah I mean the the data

822
00:31:35,669 --> 00:31:38,399
store piece is it's a very different set

823
00:31:38,399 --> 00:31:40,019
of concerns between a no sequel

824
00:31:40,019 --> 00:31:43,740
injection database and like Redis right

825
00:31:43,740 --> 00:31:45,149
I mean that's there's a there's a big

826
00:31:45,149 --> 00:31:46,889
difference in what you're looking for so

827
00:31:46,889 --> 00:31:48,299
you need to know that in advance before

828
00:31:48,299 --> 00:31:51,139
you go you know spending too much time

829
00:31:51,139 --> 00:31:53,100
going down a rabbit hole or just

830
00:31:53,100 --> 00:31:56,129
completely missing that that that

831
00:31:56,129 --> 00:32:00,869
potential attack vector that did not go

832
00:32:00,869 --> 00:32:03,210
to the next one there we go right so

833
00:32:03,210 --> 00:32:05,009
this is then the app archeology bit

834
00:32:05,009 --> 00:32:07,529
which is part of its looking at

835
00:32:07,529 --> 00:32:10,080
documentation part of its looking at

836
00:32:10,080 --> 00:32:13,379
unit tests so people kind of always seem

837
00:32:13,379 --> 00:32:15,090
to forget or I shouldn't say people

838
00:32:15,090 --> 00:32:16,259
always forget that but when we bring

839
00:32:16,259 --> 00:32:18,149
this up people are kind like oh oh yeah

840
00:32:18,149 --> 00:32:20,279
didn't think of that so unit tests are

841
00:32:20,279 --> 00:32:21,990
incredibly helpful we're gonna show an

842
00:32:21,990 --> 00:32:24,179
example here in a second like they give

843
00:32:24,179 --> 00:32:25,919
you an idea of how the application

844
00:32:25,919 --> 00:32:28,649
should behave what endpoints exist what

845
00:32:28,649 --> 00:32:30,269
users are doing what what the

846
00:32:30,269 --> 00:32:32,220
expectations are of the application and

847
00:32:32,220 --> 00:32:34,549
sometimes what the expectations are not

848
00:32:34,549 --> 00:32:37,769
meaning unlike sometimes if you're super

849
00:32:37,769 --> 00:32:40,350
lucky you'll even see a tests that are

850
00:32:40,350 --> 00:32:41,850
you know testing that like the

851
00:32:41,850 --> 00:32:43,619
authorization isn't working properly on

852
00:32:43,619 --> 00:32:47,639
an endpoint which is not it's pretty

853
00:32:47,639 --> 00:32:49,080
rare but it does happen

854
00:32:49,080 --> 00:32:52,279
yeah what's yeah it's good to definitely

855
00:32:52,279 --> 00:32:56,999
take a look like bias kit does allows

856
00:32:56,999 --> 00:32:59,639
some some of the like the digging their

857
00:32:59,639 --> 00:33:02,460
cattle archaeological digging yeah yeah

858
00:33:02,460 --> 00:33:03,990
like yeah like Ken was talking about

859
00:33:03,990 --> 00:33:06,539
before on the unit test though that like

860
00:33:06,539 --> 00:33:08,039
the great thing about the unit test is

861
00:33:08,039 --> 00:33:10,529
it tells you what is important about the

862
00:33:10,529 --> 00:33:14,519
application right what is it that the

863
00:33:14,519 --> 00:33:16,619
the developers want the application to

864
00:33:16,619 --> 00:33:18,630
do so you can kind of

865
00:33:18,630 --> 00:33:21,450
flush out you know your overview of the

866
00:33:21,450 --> 00:33:23,460
application by looking at the unit test

867
00:33:23,460 --> 00:33:24,690
hey it looks like there's always some

868
00:33:24,690 --> 00:33:26,400
you know they always test like login and

869
00:33:26,400 --> 00:33:28,370
logout that's a pretty standard one but

870
00:33:28,370 --> 00:33:30,510
also once someone's logged into the

871
00:33:30,510 --> 00:33:32,070
application what is it that they expect

872
00:33:32,070 --> 00:33:34,679
should be working and you can use that

873
00:33:34,679 --> 00:33:36,539
to almost build out your map of the

874
00:33:36,539 --> 00:33:39,419
application in the next phase but at the

875
00:33:39,419 --> 00:33:41,820
very least running those unit tests me

876
00:33:41,820 --> 00:33:43,500
gives you or looking at the unit test

877
00:33:43,500 --> 00:33:45,360
gives you exactly what Ken is saying a

878
00:33:45,360 --> 00:33:47,610
good idea of how the application should

879
00:33:47,610 --> 00:33:52,230
be yeah and I mean this is a good

880
00:33:52,230 --> 00:33:54,090
example like this is we have in our

881
00:33:54,090 --> 00:33:55,530
course we have these different

882
00:33:55,530 --> 00:33:59,070
open-source applications that we well

883
00:33:59,070 --> 00:34:00,780
that we both review and go through but

884
00:34:00,780 --> 00:34:03,120
also like people choose from huge lists

885
00:34:03,120 --> 00:34:04,679
or or whatever they want and at the end

886
00:34:04,679 --> 00:34:07,320
we do this exercise where everybody

887
00:34:07,320 --> 00:34:09,690
prepares up and actually puts this

888
00:34:09,690 --> 00:34:12,600
methodology to the test in one of those

889
00:34:12,600 --> 00:34:14,100
apps is Keystone which is you're looking

890
00:34:14,100 --> 00:34:16,109
at and one of the the things here that's

891
00:34:16,109 --> 00:34:18,050
oh crap I didn't mean to do that I

892
00:34:18,050 --> 00:34:22,460
clicked on it hold on I'm sorry everyone

893
00:34:22,460 --> 00:34:25,590
can you still see the slides yeah we're

894
00:34:25,590 --> 00:34:26,668
okay just keep going

895
00:34:26,668 --> 00:34:28,469
alright and it's kind of weird looking

896
00:34:28,469 --> 00:34:32,480
but whatever it'll work so yeah the

897
00:34:32,480 --> 00:34:34,889
actually that is bothering me why is it

898
00:34:34,889 --> 00:34:36,960
not fullscreen what happened

899
00:34:36,960 --> 00:34:40,168
maybe something wrong hold on give me

900
00:34:40,168 --> 00:34:41,760
one second I'm gonna fix this cuz it's

901
00:34:41,760 --> 00:34:44,969
gonna bother me I know I know

902
00:34:44,969 --> 00:34:50,010
being too picky but don't like it

903
00:34:50,010 --> 00:34:51,739
[Music]

904
00:34:51,739 --> 00:34:57,440
alright I'm sure then we should be good

905
00:34:57,440 --> 00:35:02,130
alright do you see it yep we're good

906
00:35:02,130 --> 00:35:04,770
cool sweet awesome so this is just an

907
00:35:04,770 --> 00:35:06,359
example of it's not really there's

908
00:35:06,359 --> 00:35:07,980
nothing like mind blowing here but what

909
00:35:07,980 --> 00:35:09,750
is interesting is this immediately tells

910
00:35:09,750 --> 00:35:10,950
us

911
00:35:10,950 --> 00:35:13,680
hey there's an admin part to this

912
00:35:13,680 --> 00:35:15,240
application we didn't know that before

913
00:35:15,240 --> 00:35:16,589
I'm not running the application or not

914
00:35:16,589 --> 00:35:18,510
looking at the application dynamically

915
00:35:18,510 --> 00:35:20,400
we're just lick you all we have is this

916
00:35:20,400 --> 00:35:21,809
like written material which is source

917
00:35:21,809 --> 00:35:23,819
code right so this immediately helps us

918
00:35:23,819 --> 00:35:25,500
know like oh there's this there's just a

919
00:35:25,500 --> 00:35:28,380
band UI or this admin URL to get into

920
00:35:28,380 --> 00:35:30,779
the admin UI and like here's the

921
00:35:30,779 --> 00:35:33,750
location and once you sign in it does

922
00:35:33,750 --> 00:35:35,849
this redirect using that from parameter

923
00:35:35,849 --> 00:35:38,700
is that from parameter vulnerable add

924
00:35:38,700 --> 00:35:40,859
another thing to look at just you know

925
00:35:40,859 --> 00:35:42,029
these are the things that are pretty

926
00:35:42,029 --> 00:35:44,430
cool like to to sort of get an idea of

927
00:35:44,430 --> 00:35:45,779
how an application works that's one

928
00:35:45,779 --> 00:35:47,640
small example but you'd obviously go

929
00:35:47,640 --> 00:35:48,750
through every single unit test

930
00:35:48,750 --> 00:35:51,299
especially ones that and I think we show

931
00:35:51,299 --> 00:35:53,160
this later there's definitely some

932
00:35:53,160 --> 00:35:55,049
things that are just labeled like hey

933
00:35:55,049 --> 00:35:58,890
security thing or you know I don't know

934
00:35:58,890 --> 00:36:01,349
like quick jacking test or something

935
00:36:01,349 --> 00:36:02,880
like that I mean there really are like

936
00:36:02,880 --> 00:36:04,799
it's crazy some of the things you came

937
00:36:04,799 --> 00:36:06,690
across now when we talk about

938
00:36:06,690 --> 00:36:08,789
note-taking this is actually again a

939
00:36:08,789 --> 00:36:10,680
really important thing like it's maybe

940
00:36:10,680 --> 00:36:13,680
not as super slick and cool and seems

941
00:36:13,680 --> 00:36:15,269
elite but it's actually like really

942
00:36:15,269 --> 00:36:16,859
necessary I'm gonna show you an example

943
00:36:16,859 --> 00:36:20,519
of so we're gonna show you an example

944
00:36:20,519 --> 00:36:22,319
that's just like the base level and

945
00:36:22,319 --> 00:36:26,309
these these and these PowerPoint slides

946
00:36:26,309 --> 00:36:28,079
but then I'm going to show you what we

947
00:36:28,079 --> 00:36:31,920
actually did with our last course we

948
00:36:31,920 --> 00:36:33,779
gave this so as a group we did this

949
00:36:33,779 --> 00:36:35,579
together in the morning of our second

950
00:36:35,579 --> 00:36:37,049
day we actually followed this

951
00:36:37,049 --> 00:36:39,109
methodology together and we built a

952
00:36:39,109 --> 00:36:42,990
actual checklist and we do that in all

953
00:36:42,990 --> 00:36:43,980
of our courses but I'm gonna show you

954
00:36:43,980 --> 00:36:45,869
the last course like what we came up

955
00:36:45,869 --> 00:36:47,789
with so you get a a real view of what

956
00:36:47,789 --> 00:36:50,789
that looks like so the things you'll

957
00:36:50,789 --> 00:36:53,009
typically see in this all of this is

958
00:36:53,009 --> 00:36:55,799
like you can change this however you

959
00:36:55,799 --> 00:36:58,349
want but I like to have the commitment

960
00:36:58,349 --> 00:36:59,579
number I think that's actually a super

961
00:36:59,579 --> 00:37:00,809
important thing I like to have the

962
00:37:00,809 --> 00:37:03,150
commit number because it tells me like

963
00:37:03,150 --> 00:37:04,769
if you can get that get commit number

964
00:37:04,769 --> 00:37:06,420
the reason I like that is it says at

965
00:37:06,420 --> 00:37:08,430
this point in time this is what code I

966
00:37:08,430 --> 00:37:10,680
looked at if any other thing happened

967
00:37:10,680 --> 00:37:12,869
after that I don't know about it like

968
00:37:12,869 --> 00:37:16,079
this is what we reviewed if I back and

969
00:37:16,079 --> 00:37:19,109
review this in a month or whatever the

970
00:37:19,109 --> 00:37:22,200
case is I now know the last commit point

971
00:37:22,200 --> 00:37:24,240
to the newest commit point that Delta in

972
00:37:24,240 --> 00:37:24,690
beach

973
00:37:24,690 --> 00:37:26,789
what to look at like what's important I

974
00:37:26,789 --> 00:37:29,420
can now see what has changed in that

975
00:37:29,420 --> 00:37:32,190
that makes my life easier so that's

976
00:37:32,190 --> 00:37:35,490
incredibly important and please always

977
00:37:35,490 --> 00:37:38,069
put that in there if you can and then

978
00:37:38,069 --> 00:37:39,270
you'll have your actual findings which

979
00:37:39,270 --> 00:37:40,890
is a separate thing and then you'll have

980
00:37:40,890 --> 00:37:42,150
your notes from the review which is the

981
00:37:42,150 --> 00:37:44,640
part where we're really focused on

982
00:37:44,640 --> 00:37:46,920
so what it's easiest if we just show

983
00:37:46,920 --> 00:37:50,460
that so on the right side it looks kind

984
00:37:50,460 --> 00:37:56,309
of like what I'm showing you here is

985
00:37:56,309 --> 00:37:58,410
actually on the left and right it's

986
00:37:58,410 --> 00:38:01,020
actually one when I do my job because I

987
00:38:01,020 --> 00:38:02,460
work at github and I write up my

988
00:38:02,460 --> 00:38:05,760
findings in issues it this all goes into

989
00:38:05,760 --> 00:38:07,710
the same spot right so it's it's an

990
00:38:07,710 --> 00:38:11,039
issue common that has at the top my

991
00:38:11,039 --> 00:38:13,589
findings and then a little separator

992
00:38:13,589 --> 00:38:16,740
visual separator with all of the with

993
00:38:16,740 --> 00:38:20,490
all of the notes and I actually do

994
00:38:20,490 --> 00:38:22,079
explicitly put on their notes for the

995
00:38:22,079 --> 00:38:24,839
apps tech team only meaning feel free to

996
00:38:24,839 --> 00:38:26,460
ignore if you're a developer but our

997
00:38:26,460 --> 00:38:28,740
team needs to see this information so

998
00:38:28,740 --> 00:38:31,079
that's cool that's kind of what it looks

999
00:38:31,079 --> 00:38:32,760
like let me stop the share and actually

1000
00:38:32,760 --> 00:38:36,750
bring up a real version that we had from

1001
00:38:36,750 --> 00:38:39,869
our last course so that it's a little

1002
00:38:39,869 --> 00:38:42,299
bit clearer yeah and this real version

1003
00:38:42,299 --> 00:38:44,849
it like we when we do the walkthrough

1004
00:38:44,849 --> 00:38:46,740
we've got a vulnerable application that

1005
00:38:46,740 --> 00:38:49,260
we look at in this case I think it's

1006
00:38:49,260 --> 00:38:51,450
Django is the one it's like a vulnerable

1007
00:38:51,450 --> 00:38:54,869
task manager that we review but you'll

1008
00:38:54,869 --> 00:38:56,970
notice that it's it is in the same

1009
00:38:56,970 --> 00:38:59,819
format right we've got you know the

1010
00:38:59,819 --> 00:39:01,079
behavior all those questions that we

1011
00:39:01,079 --> 00:39:03,059
talked about before you know as well as

1012
00:39:03,059 --> 00:39:04,980
you know as you scroll down all I can

1013
00:39:04,980 --> 00:39:06,569
talk to it he's the one that filled this

1014
00:39:06,569 --> 00:39:08,779
out

1015
00:39:11,520 --> 00:39:14,590
can you still I'm sorry my audio is so

1016
00:39:14,590 --> 00:39:16,690
choppy yeah yeah if my audios I'll

1017
00:39:16,690 --> 00:39:19,140
choppy I don't know my Wi-Fi probably

1018
00:39:19,140 --> 00:39:23,520
sorry if I interrupted unintentionally

1019
00:39:23,520 --> 00:39:26,020
okay you're still there cool yes though

1020
00:39:26,020 --> 00:39:27,610
we got the commit number that we

1021
00:39:27,610 --> 00:39:29,619
assessed at and we you know we did we

1022
00:39:29,619 --> 00:39:30,670
answered the questions that we talked

1023
00:39:30,670 --> 00:39:32,200
about like what does it do it's a task

1024
00:39:32,200 --> 00:39:34,150
manager who does it do for internal and

1025
00:39:34,150 --> 00:39:35,830
external customers cool nothing mind

1026
00:39:35,830 --> 00:39:37,960
blow in there what information will it

1027
00:39:37,960 --> 00:39:38,890
hold now this is where it gets

1028
00:39:38,890 --> 00:39:41,350
interesting it will hold information

1029
00:39:41,350 --> 00:39:44,830
about users so like PII tasks that might

1030
00:39:44,830 --> 00:39:47,230
contain sensitive data now where this

1031
00:39:47,230 --> 00:39:49,180
got interesting is that when we realize

1032
00:39:49,180 --> 00:39:50,530
that there's an internal and external

1033
00:39:50,530 --> 00:39:53,320
customer base and this is a task manager

1034
00:39:53,320 --> 00:39:56,110
with projects and with notes on those

1035
00:39:56,110 --> 00:39:58,780
projects that there might be a risk that

1036
00:39:58,780 --> 00:40:00,310
the very company that developed this

1037
00:40:00,310 --> 00:40:02,619
task manager is also using the task

1038
00:40:02,619 --> 00:40:04,780
manager to put in potentially sensitive

1039
00:40:04,780 --> 00:40:07,270
information maybe even security issues

1040
00:40:07,270 --> 00:40:10,180
around the very inside of the very task

1041
00:40:10,180 --> 00:40:11,680
manager that they're talking about so

1042
00:40:11,680 --> 00:40:14,730
you know that was just something like

1043
00:40:14,730 --> 00:40:18,060
from kind of outside of the box thinking

1044
00:40:18,060 --> 00:40:20,500
scenario that we kind of all came

1045
00:40:20,500 --> 00:40:25,060
together and and and talked about so the

1046
00:40:25,060 --> 00:40:27,760
Recon of the company makeup like you

1047
00:40:27,760 --> 00:40:30,310
know because of the people the fact that

1048
00:40:30,310 --> 00:40:31,690
the company's actually using this task

1049
00:40:31,690 --> 00:40:34,630
manager and you would have to consider

1050
00:40:34,630 --> 00:40:37,210
everything like a note a task project

1051
00:40:37,210 --> 00:40:40,060
all of that stuff file uploads or sorry

1052
00:40:40,060 --> 00:40:42,340
all of that stuff's to be sensitive and

1053
00:40:42,340 --> 00:40:44,050
then in terms of file uploads obviously

1054
00:40:44,050 --> 00:40:47,020
file uploads are like typically one of

1055
00:40:47,020 --> 00:40:51,160
your most if it's not being uploaded to

1056
00:40:51,160 --> 00:40:53,380
even then if it's being uploaded s3 but

1057
00:40:53,380 --> 00:40:55,359
you know like file handling is always

1058
00:40:55,359 --> 00:40:57,400
sort of a sensitive thing and so

1059
00:40:57,400 --> 00:40:58,869
definitely make it we've definitely made

1060
00:40:58,869 --> 00:41:00,550
a note of it and one of the different

1061
00:41:00,550 --> 00:41:01,960
types of roles we talked about fact

1062
00:41:01,960 --> 00:41:03,880
there's admins project managers team

1063
00:41:03,880 --> 00:41:06,550
members we talked about like what they

1064
00:41:06,550 --> 00:41:12,090
you know team members can do X project

1065
00:41:14,140 --> 00:41:17,109
they're supposed to be allowed to do and

1066
00:41:17,109 --> 00:41:19,960
then we we came up with like we by

1067
00:41:19,960 --> 00:41:22,359
asking questions like what would concern

1068
00:41:22,359 --> 00:41:25,690
us the staff right in this case but

1069
00:41:25,690 --> 00:41:27,940
normally you'd be asking and the file

1070
00:41:27,940 --> 00:41:31,569
handling both how all the this came from

1071
00:41:31,569 --> 00:41:35,289
this is together and about like an XML

1072
00:41:35,289 --> 00:41:36,069
um

1073
00:41:36,069 --> 00:41:37,930
that's always something we get concerned

1074
00:41:37,930 --> 00:41:42,430
what about loads or yeah and only if

1075
00:41:42,430 --> 00:41:45,190
file uploads I should say and then uh

1076
00:41:45,190 --> 00:41:47,230
like sensitive data being exposed

1077
00:41:47,230 --> 00:41:49,630
through like ID or insecure direct

1078
00:41:49,630 --> 00:41:52,749
object reference business logic like you

1079
00:41:52,749 --> 00:41:57,519
know being able to you know or come in

1080
00:41:57,519 --> 00:42:01,239
and mess things up I think is what that

1081
00:42:01,239 --> 00:42:01,690
was about

1082
00:42:01,690 --> 00:42:03,700
I don't really remember but yeah so

1083
00:42:03,700 --> 00:42:05,200
that's that's pretty cool we have at

1084
00:42:05,200 --> 00:42:11,410
least now ready before we even go into

1085
00:42:11,410 --> 00:42:13,869
our brainstorming section down here

1086
00:42:13,869 --> 00:42:15,220
which we're talking about a second we we

1087
00:42:15,220 --> 00:42:16,930
did the basic stuff like here's an ORM

1088
00:42:16,930 --> 00:42:23,019
an object object relational mapping is

1089
00:42:23,019 --> 00:42:25,739
that what okay how am I forgetting ORM

1090
00:42:25,739 --> 00:42:29,140
but yeah so we know that the ORM library

1091
00:42:29,140 --> 00:42:32,559
is my sequel client which is important

1092
00:42:32,559 --> 00:42:35,170
right want to know and it's but it's

1093
00:42:35,170 --> 00:42:36,160
pretty simple there's probably more

1094
00:42:36,160 --> 00:42:37,779
third party components that are involved

1095
00:42:37,779 --> 00:42:40,509
here sometimes we you know like we said

1096
00:42:40,509 --> 00:42:43,569
we'll probably like if there's 300 third

1097
00:42:43,569 --> 00:42:44,739
party components we're probably just

1098
00:42:44,739 --> 00:42:45,819
gonna pull out the ones that were

1099
00:42:45,819 --> 00:42:47,920
interested in that may have some sort of

1100
00:42:47,920 --> 00:42:51,579
security issue so in this case it was

1101
00:42:51,579 --> 00:42:53,710
like hey my sequel is this this is the

1102
00:42:53,710 --> 00:42:56,349
ORM client that's being used by jingo we

1103
00:42:56,349 --> 00:42:57,910
know that that could have sequel

1104
00:42:57,910 --> 00:42:59,440
injection involved with it so maybe

1105
00:42:59,440 --> 00:43:02,079
let's call that one out you know again

1106
00:43:02,079 --> 00:43:04,539
this is kind of a compressed review so

1107
00:43:04,539 --> 00:43:05,799
we didn't have everything that was in

1108
00:43:05,799 --> 00:43:09,640
there anyway yeah yeah no and actually

1109
00:43:09,640 --> 00:43:11,319
it's it's it's good to know that and we

1110
00:43:11,319 --> 00:43:13,390
talked about this down here like like

1111
00:43:13,390 --> 00:43:15,970
why would the ORM come into play but for

1112
00:43:15,970 --> 00:43:17,859
those that aren't familiar because I

1113
00:43:17,859 --> 00:43:19,569
know president beef is watching cuz I

1114
00:43:19,569 --> 00:43:21,400
saw him on slack make a comment and I

1115
00:43:21,400 --> 00:43:23,980
know he's watching this he president

1116
00:43:23,980 --> 00:43:26,049
beef is a person who Justin Collins who

1117
00:43:26,049 --> 00:43:27,940
wrote brakeman which is like a rail Oh

1118
00:43:27,940 --> 00:43:32,349
source rails static analysis tool he has

1119
00:43:32,349 --> 00:43:34,240
this like between rails three rails for

1120
00:43:34,240 --> 00:43:36,510
rails five the different insecure

1121
00:43:36,510 --> 00:43:39,849
methods of the ORM the act of record or

1122
00:43:39,849 --> 00:43:42,430
I'm like insecure by default methods

1123
00:43:42,430 --> 00:43:43,750
like functions if you use them for

1124
00:43:43,750 --> 00:43:45,130
instance like dock clock is just

1125
00:43:45,130 --> 00:43:47,730
immediately or used to be anyways

1126
00:43:47,730 --> 00:43:50,140
vulnerable to sequel injection just by

1127
00:43:50,140 --> 00:43:52,900
if you put user and put into it and some

1128
00:43:52,900 --> 00:43:55,599
methods can just be used in securely so

1129
00:43:55,599 --> 00:43:56,980
that's why it's important to know like

1130
00:43:56,980 --> 00:43:59,650
okay what is in this case like what's

1131
00:43:59,650 --> 00:44:01,180
the RM and then what are the things we

1132
00:44:01,180 --> 00:44:02,710
should be worrying about and when we

1133
00:44:02,710 --> 00:44:04,599
talked about looking at the framework

1134
00:44:04,599 --> 00:44:06,430
documentation when you look at the

1135
00:44:06,430 --> 00:44:09,190
framework documentation for Jengo and

1136
00:44:09,190 --> 00:44:11,650
the ORM it specifically tells you like

1137
00:44:11,650 --> 00:44:16,720
here all perfect base meaning unsafe way

1138
00:44:16,720 --> 00:44:19,780
bra sequel so these are the things we

1139
00:44:19,780 --> 00:44:21,280
get a little bit concerned about which

1140
00:44:21,280 --> 00:44:24,819
is like raw extra execute these are the

1141
00:44:24,819 --> 00:44:27,130
things now we need we need to look for

1142
00:44:27,130 --> 00:44:29,410
we know when you did look for now when

1143
00:44:29,410 --> 00:44:30,670
you get to this brainstorming and risk

1144
00:44:30,670 --> 00:44:33,549
section do this with somebody else I

1145
00:44:33,549 --> 00:44:35,829
cannot stress that enough do that with

1146
00:44:35,829 --> 00:44:37,569
somebody else don't do it alone like

1147
00:44:37,569 --> 00:44:39,849
feel free to start filling out alone but

1148
00:44:39,849 --> 00:44:41,589
jump on a call with one of your

1149
00:44:41,589 --> 00:44:44,559
co-workers and talk through this because

1150
00:44:44,559 --> 00:44:48,309
what we had we just as an experiment at

1151
00:44:48,309 --> 00:44:52,390
our we at like where I work one of our

1152
00:44:52,390 --> 00:44:58,869
folks bra two people myself included of

1153
00:44:58,869 --> 00:45:01,000
like the risks that they were concerned

1154
00:45:01,000 --> 00:45:02,799
about in and out guess what we all

1155
00:45:02,799 --> 00:45:04,480
thought of different risks we didn't

1156
00:45:04,480 --> 00:45:06,160
come up with any of the same stuff and

1157
00:45:06,160 --> 00:45:07,869
that's the important part is you need to

1158
00:45:07,869 --> 00:45:09,700
pets to why that's important you need to

1159
00:45:09,700 --> 00:45:11,109
get other people's input because they

1160
00:45:11,109 --> 00:45:13,240
are very likely to think of something

1161
00:45:13,240 --> 00:45:15,880
you did not so the more the better this

1162
00:45:15,880 --> 00:45:20,980
is a thing code why not code review that

1163
00:45:20,980 --> 00:45:25,299
should also be social anyways enough of

1164
00:45:25,299 --> 00:45:27,160
that tangent again going back to like

1165
00:45:27,160 --> 00:45:29,099
the framework the framework

1166
00:45:29,099 --> 00:45:31,809
documentation when it comes to like okay

1167
00:45:31,809 --> 00:45:34,029
how do you you know typically these

1168
00:45:34,029 --> 00:45:36,789
frameworks have maybe templating for

1169
00:45:36,789 --> 00:45:37,839
their view who is like they'll have

1170
00:45:37,839 --> 00:45:39,530
templates

1171
00:45:39,530 --> 00:45:44,240
ruby has er B Django has some like some

1172
00:45:44,240 --> 00:45:45,980
I don't I think it's like still just dot

1173
00:45:45,980 --> 00:45:48,740
html' but it's got like the Django code

1174
00:45:48,740 --> 00:45:51,800
inside of it like so it's yeah and when

1175
00:45:51,800 --> 00:45:54,320
it's being rendered at runtime it's like

1176
00:45:54,320 --> 00:45:57,800
showing both the code that's dynamic as

1177
00:45:57,800 --> 00:46:00,470
well as the static content yeah it's

1178
00:46:00,470 --> 00:46:02,510
it's got its own templating language yep

1179
00:46:02,510 --> 00:46:05,990
our certain functions the the

1180
00:46:05,990 --> 00:46:08,390
documentation tells you are instant

1181
00:46:08,390 --> 00:46:11,210
what's that Seth no it just yeah those

1182
00:46:11,210 --> 00:46:13,280
are the is it's got its own templating

1183
00:46:13,280 --> 00:46:14,690
language right and that's what you're

1184
00:46:14,690 --> 00:46:16,160
talking about there is those are the

1185
00:46:16,160 --> 00:46:17,990
those are the tags that you want to

1186
00:46:17,990 --> 00:46:19,730
search for right so you would have

1187
00:46:19,730 --> 00:46:21,080
pulled that out of the documentation

1188
00:46:21,080 --> 00:46:26,720
itself for Django templates yep yeah and

1189
00:46:26,720 --> 00:46:29,090
then once you've created your Bret your

1190
00:46:29,090 --> 00:46:30,800
list of brainstorming risks create a

1191
00:46:30,800 --> 00:46:34,160
checklist now you that says like here's

1192
00:46:34,160 --> 00:46:37,190
what these are the things we're gonna

1193
00:46:37,190 --> 00:46:40,010
look for and this isn't a complete

1194
00:46:40,010 --> 00:46:42,020
mapping your routes next and I probably

1195
00:46:42,020 --> 00:46:48,589
should start yeah yeah bring up it let's

1196
00:46:48,589 --> 00:46:51,109
talk about mapping next right so so

1197
00:46:51,109 --> 00:46:52,700
basically we're actually you know

1198
00:46:52,700 --> 00:46:56,180
documenting everything else out as far

1199
00:46:56,180 --> 00:46:59,270
as you know that we use that template

1200
00:46:59,270 --> 00:47:00,950
and I use that template on it you know

1201
00:47:00,950 --> 00:47:02,660
almost a daily basis to actually push

1202
00:47:02,660 --> 00:47:04,849
things out I know Ken does as well you

1203
00:47:04,849 --> 00:47:07,849
can tweak it to your specific instance

1204
00:47:07,849 --> 00:47:10,190
or you know what you like to see how how

1205
00:47:10,190 --> 00:47:11,660
you like to do it but each of those

1206
00:47:11,660 --> 00:47:13,099
different items has got to be in there

1207
00:47:13,099 --> 00:47:14,570
somewhere is basically what it boils

1208
00:47:14,570 --> 00:47:22,400
down to yeah yeah yeah I mean we already

1209
00:47:22,400 --> 00:47:24,080
looked at Keystone a little bit I think

1210
00:47:24,080 --> 00:47:25,700
you know the BTM review we've we've

1211
00:47:25,700 --> 00:47:26,930
talked about each of these so let's

1212
00:47:26,930 --> 00:47:32,240
let's move through let's get on to map

1213
00:47:32,240 --> 00:47:35,900
all right yes we talked about

1214
00:47:35,900 --> 00:47:37,940
information gathering there's mapping

1215
00:47:37,940 --> 00:47:41,810
and for that specifically like again you

1216
00:47:41,810 --> 00:47:43,670
need to know what you're working with we

1217
00:47:43,670 --> 00:47:45,680
give some examples here of like nodejs

1218
00:47:45,680 --> 00:47:47,660
here's where it's typically here's where

1219
00:47:47,660 --> 00:47:49,280
your routes typically get defined we

1220
00:47:49,280 --> 00:47:52,130
talked about Java and.net rails and

1221
00:47:52,130 --> 00:47:53,630
everything else and we talked about like

1222
00:47:53,630 --> 00:47:55,640
how to find where end points get defined

1223
00:47:55,640 --> 00:47:57,019
because when you talk about source to

1224
00:47:57,019 --> 00:47:59,210
sink that means the entry point of where

1225
00:47:59,210 --> 00:48:02,269
a request starts like you sent in the

1226
00:48:02,269 --> 00:48:05,210
request off to an application the

1227
00:48:05,210 --> 00:48:06,920
application gets that request what does

1228
00:48:06,920 --> 00:48:08,630
it do next well first you need to look

1229
00:48:08,630 --> 00:48:10,819
at like where it's to find its routes

1230
00:48:10,819 --> 00:48:13,009
because from there it's gonna say okay

1231
00:48:13,009 --> 00:48:15,049
here's where this route goes this is

1232
00:48:15,049 --> 00:48:18,529
what path HTTP path you requested now

1233
00:48:18,529 --> 00:48:20,630
I'm gonna send it to you know I might

1234
00:48:20,630 --> 00:48:22,490
hit this authorization logic filter

1235
00:48:22,490 --> 00:48:24,289
first and then forward it to a

1236
00:48:24,289 --> 00:48:27,079
controller and then some logical be

1237
00:48:27,079 --> 00:48:28,880
processed and then at the end of the day

1238
00:48:28,880 --> 00:48:30,559
I'll make a DB query or maybe I'll

1239
00:48:30,559 --> 00:48:32,839
update a DB record and that's the you

1240
00:48:32,839 --> 00:48:35,809
know and then a return and then I return

1241
00:48:35,809 --> 00:48:37,970
a view and that's the end of that that's

1242
00:48:37,970 --> 00:48:39,799
source to sink that's like where that

1243
00:48:39,799 --> 00:48:42,109
request goes end to end that's what I'm

1244
00:48:42,109 --> 00:48:43,789
talking about here you didn't want the

1245
00:48:43,789 --> 00:48:46,339
one thing that you and they typically do

1246
00:48:46,339 --> 00:48:50,359
have these three yeah sorry the one

1247
00:48:50,359 --> 00:48:52,549
thing that I wanted to bring up there is

1248
00:48:52,549 --> 00:48:54,410
I know this is very web heavy what we're

1249
00:48:54,410 --> 00:48:57,019
looking at right here but that's not

1250
00:48:57,019 --> 00:49:00,470
always the case where it's not like the

1251
00:49:00,470 --> 00:49:02,000
the methodology that we're talking about

1252
00:49:02,000 --> 00:49:04,849
isn't necessarily specific to web right

1253
00:49:04,849 --> 00:49:07,720
I could I could create the same map of

1254
00:49:07,720 --> 00:49:10,940
you know IOT applications or mobile

1255
00:49:10,940 --> 00:49:14,839
applications or you know some sort of

1256
00:49:14,839 --> 00:49:17,029
Windows application it's all a matter of

1257
00:49:17,029 --> 00:49:19,099
figuring out where the sources come in

1258
00:49:19,099 --> 00:49:21,559
and where the sinks go out so just

1259
00:49:21,559 --> 00:49:23,029
because we're very web heavy because

1260
00:49:23,029 --> 00:49:24,680
that's what we deal with on a daily

1261
00:49:24,680 --> 00:49:26,210
basis doesn't mean that we haven't used

1262
00:49:26,210 --> 00:49:28,430
the methodology for other types of

1263
00:49:28,430 --> 00:49:30,309
applications because it does happen

1264
00:49:30,309 --> 00:49:32,720
across the board most applications

1265
00:49:32,720 --> 00:49:34,430
that's what they are is some complex

1266
00:49:34,430 --> 00:49:36,740
state engine and all we're doing is

1267
00:49:36,740 --> 00:49:39,109
taking the source from the user or from

1268
00:49:39,109 --> 00:49:41,029
a file or whatever else and tracing it

1269
00:49:41,029 --> 00:49:42,349
through to the sink and figuring out

1270
00:49:42,349 --> 00:49:44,930
what security issues exist with that

1271
00:49:44,930 --> 00:49:47,690
flow so the importance of creating the

1272
00:49:47,690 --> 00:49:50,900
map is the same whether or not the

1273
00:49:50,900 --> 00:49:52,519
application is web application a mobile

1274
00:49:52,519 --> 00:49:55,069
application IIT or whatever else it it

1275
00:49:55,069 --> 00:49:57,230
all falls down and that's why we created

1276
00:49:57,230 --> 00:50:01,009
the map sorry can go ahead keep going no

1277
00:50:01,009 --> 00:50:03,920
no I mean you know maybe because I'm

1278
00:50:03,920 --> 00:50:05,450
breaking up it might make sense to have

1279
00:50:05,450 --> 00:50:07,160
you talk to some of this but

1280
00:50:07,160 --> 00:50:09,499
for this last point it's just that you

1281
00:50:09,499 --> 00:50:10,759
know whenever you have a route you

1282
00:50:10,759 --> 00:50:12,470
typically do have a place where either

1283
00:50:12,470 --> 00:50:14,479
unless it's you know unless you're like

1284
00:50:14,479 --> 00:50:22,700
well anybody can reach will yeah but for

1285
00:50:22,700 --> 00:50:24,470
anything that's not dated you know

1286
00:50:24,470 --> 00:50:26,059
there's typically be an authorization

1287
00:50:26,059 --> 00:50:28,430
filter that sits with that route quarter

1288
00:50:28,430 --> 00:50:30,859
that routes going to where you hit the

1289
00:50:30,859 --> 00:50:34,479
controller there's a rep as a

1290
00:50:34,479 --> 00:50:43,190
authorization inversa yeah yeah can you

1291
00:50:43,190 --> 00:50:44,690
break the rep goes in with some

1292
00:50:44,690 --> 00:50:47,029
parameter yeah why don't you once you

1293
00:50:47,029 --> 00:50:49,430
speak to it Seth yeah so the

1294
00:50:49,430 --> 00:50:51,109
authorization filter what Ken saying is

1295
00:50:51,109 --> 00:50:52,700
basically you know there's going to be

1296
00:50:52,700 --> 00:50:53,989
something that checks whether or not a

1297
00:50:53,989 --> 00:50:55,579
person can access the endpoint that's

1298
00:50:55,579 --> 00:50:57,380
being looked at right

1299
00:50:57,380 --> 00:50:59,029
sometimes it's there's different

1300
00:50:59,029 --> 00:51:00,349
definition points in each of the

1301
00:51:00,349 --> 00:51:01,940
different frameworks that we look at and

1302
00:51:01,940 --> 00:51:04,609
then once that authorization filter is

1303
00:51:04,609 --> 00:51:06,289
passed or failed then it goes to the

1304
00:51:06,289 --> 00:51:08,210
logic processing and then we trace it

1305
00:51:08,210 --> 00:51:09,470
through all the way to the data store

1306
00:51:09,470 --> 00:51:11,839
access and whether that data store is

1307
00:51:11,839 --> 00:51:13,789
you know model and then the review

1308
00:51:13,789 --> 00:51:15,950
that's returned but that's that's

1309
00:51:15,950 --> 00:51:17,509
typically what we're looking at let's

1310
00:51:17,509 --> 00:51:18,950
look at a couple of the examples here

1311
00:51:18,950 --> 00:51:21,129
can

1312
00:51:22,820 --> 00:51:24,470
we got seven minutes left Sam Sam's

1313
00:51:24,470 --> 00:51:26,780
anxious we're not gonna make it through

1314
00:51:26,780 --> 00:51:28,340
all the content so you're gonna have to

1315
00:51:28,340 --> 00:51:31,810
hit us up so typical application flow

1316
00:51:31,810 --> 00:51:34,520
right this is exactly what Ken at the

1317
00:51:34,520 --> 00:51:35,720
end points that we were talking about

1318
00:51:35,720 --> 00:51:38,390
some sort of routing the user is routed

1319
00:51:38,390 --> 00:51:40,490
to a specific end point or a specific

1320
00:51:40,490 --> 00:51:42,770
function there are either authorized to

1321
00:51:42,770 --> 00:51:45,590
access that function or not that

1322
00:51:45,590 --> 00:51:47,420
processing logic happens after the

1323
00:51:47,420 --> 00:51:49,130
authorization and then either hits a

1324
00:51:49,130 --> 00:51:50,780
database or external services before

1325
00:51:50,780 --> 00:51:54,100
returning back to the user

1326
00:51:54,290 --> 00:51:56,270
the next example I think is actually

1327
00:51:56,270 --> 00:51:59,060
rails so this is the implementation for

1328
00:51:59,060 --> 00:52:01,280
rails so where you find the different

1329
00:52:01,280 --> 00:52:03,950
information right routes dot RB before

1330
00:52:03,950 --> 00:52:05,780
action before filter actually shows what

1331
00:52:05,780 --> 00:52:07,760
sort of authorization happens on each of

1332
00:52:07,760 --> 00:52:09,560
the different endpoints and then the

1333
00:52:09,560 --> 00:52:11,720
processing logic happens from there so

1334
00:52:11,720 --> 00:52:13,280
that the four action before filter the

1335
00:52:13,280 --> 00:52:15,200
route actually defines where it's going

1336
00:52:15,200 --> 00:52:18,290
to show the example itself ken from the

1337
00:52:18,290 --> 00:52:20,470
code

1338
00:52:21,960 --> 00:52:27,130
it's the next slide yeah oh I mean yeah

1339
00:52:27,130 --> 00:52:30,160
yeah let's do it about that's it's the

1340
00:52:30,160 --> 00:52:31,810
actual like how the routes are defined

1341
00:52:31,810 --> 00:52:34,210
but if you want to look at like dang it

1342
00:52:34,210 --> 00:52:38,110
if you want to look at spur of like the

1343
00:52:38,110 --> 00:52:42,940
basic gist here words yeah so for the

1344
00:52:42,940 --> 00:52:44,980
forgot password route it's a get request

1345
00:52:44,980 --> 00:52:49,810
to slash you know which then corresponds

1346
00:52:49,810 --> 00:52:53,050
to the password reset RB file which has

1347
00:52:53,050 --> 00:52:56,530
a forgot password function in it right

1348
00:52:56,530 --> 00:53:00,180
the controller is the password resets

1349
00:53:01,950 --> 00:53:03,030
I don't know if we need to talk about

1350
00:53:03,030 --> 00:53:07,230
the I'm yeah I'm gonna skip through let

1351
00:53:07,230 --> 00:53:09,660
me uh exit out of here and skip through

1352
00:53:09,660 --> 00:53:12,270
to one bit like when it comes to mapping

1353
00:53:12,270 --> 00:53:14,220
one thing I want to just real quickly

1354
00:53:14,220 --> 00:53:18,960
show is that why does that matter so

1355
00:53:18,960 --> 00:53:25,049
when the reason we talk just this if you

1356
00:53:25,049 --> 00:53:26,520
could walk them through that stuff like

1357
00:53:26,520 --> 00:53:28,619
what are we doing here with this part of

1358
00:53:28,619 --> 00:53:30,210
the write-up because we talked about all

1359
00:53:30,210 --> 00:53:34,349
of this up to here but we have okay yeah

1360
00:53:34,349 --> 00:53:37,950
so what we're dealing with on each of

1361
00:53:37,950 --> 00:53:40,440
the different routes so this is actually

1362
00:53:40,440 --> 00:53:42,869
gonna you know drive the checklist that

1363
00:53:42,869 --> 00:53:45,660
we're reviewing we've got all the

1364
00:53:45,660 --> 00:53:47,160
brainstorming and risk that we've come

1365
00:53:47,160 --> 00:53:48,750
up with we build out a list of the

1366
00:53:48,750 --> 00:53:51,089
routes in the application and ideally we

1367
00:53:51,089 --> 00:53:52,500
want to step through each of the routes

1368
00:53:52,500 --> 00:53:54,569
and check the source to sink in them

1369
00:53:54,569 --> 00:53:56,400
right so each of them is going to have

1370
00:53:56,400 --> 00:53:57,869
different vulnerabilities that may or

1371
00:53:57,869 --> 00:54:00,059
may not apply to them whether that's you

1372
00:54:00,059 --> 00:54:02,280
know hey login should be required if

1373
00:54:02,280 --> 00:54:03,750
it's not guess what then it's

1374
00:54:03,750 --> 00:54:05,910
unauthorized maybe anybody can get to it

1375
00:54:05,910 --> 00:54:07,230
there could be sequel injection and

1376
00:54:07,230 --> 00:54:09,390
other things that we want to check by

1377
00:54:09,390 --> 00:54:11,849
doing that source to just sync trace now

1378
00:54:11,849 --> 00:54:13,829
if we have a limited amount of time to

1379
00:54:13,829 --> 00:54:16,170
do this review we may actually just be

1380
00:54:16,170 --> 00:54:19,260
pulling out routes and endpoints that

1381
00:54:19,260 --> 00:54:21,359
look like they have security issues with

1382
00:54:21,359 --> 00:54:23,730
them right so forgot password anything

1383
00:54:23,730 --> 00:54:24,780
to do with authentication authorization

1384
00:54:24,780 --> 00:54:28,349
and you'll see this in the actual the

1385
00:54:28,349 --> 00:54:29,760
document that we send over and then

1386
00:54:29,760 --> 00:54:31,619
slides when we when we provide them to

1387
00:54:31,619 --> 00:54:33,780
you but the reviews that we perform on

1388
00:54:33,780 --> 00:54:35,430
each of those levels actually

1389
00:54:35,430 --> 00:54:37,260
corresponds to the specific routes that

1390
00:54:37,260 --> 00:54:39,270
are associated with authentication and

1391
00:54:39,270 --> 00:54:41,309
authorization and other things we do

1392
00:54:41,309 --> 00:54:43,170
source to strength sync through most of

1393
00:54:43,170 --> 00:54:43,470
it

1394
00:54:43,470 --> 00:54:45,540
but when you're looking at three million

1395
00:54:45,540 --> 00:54:47,220
lines of code you've got to prioritize

1396
00:54:47,220 --> 00:54:48,990
your time and that's the reason that we

1397
00:54:48,990 --> 00:54:50,640
came up with those risks initially and

1398
00:54:50,640 --> 00:54:53,069
the checklist itself so we know where to

1399
00:54:53,069 --> 00:54:55,440
spend our time doesn't make sense for us

1400
00:54:55,440 --> 00:54:58,290
to trace down CSRF or maybe you know in

1401
00:54:58,290 --> 00:54:59,369
some of the applications it's an

1402
00:54:59,369 --> 00:55:01,319
internal application maybe CSRF isn't a

1403
00:55:01,319 --> 00:55:03,809
huge issue for that application but you

1404
00:55:03,809 --> 00:55:06,059
know sensitive data exposure or insecure

1405
00:55:06,059 --> 00:55:07,559
direct object reference is where we want

1406
00:55:07,559 --> 00:55:09,780
to spend more time because that could be

1407
00:55:09,780 --> 00:55:11,579
where someone would exploit and someone

1408
00:55:11,579 --> 00:55:13,170
would actually be able to get to data

1409
00:55:13,170 --> 00:55:15,089
and do sensitive things and so you've

1410
00:55:15,089 --> 00:55:15,869
got a priority

1411
00:55:15,869 --> 00:55:17,249
as what you're looking at so you're

1412
00:55:17,249 --> 00:55:18,960
looking at authorization maybe we're not

1413
00:55:18,960 --> 00:55:20,940
spending as much time on injection

1414
00:55:20,940 --> 00:55:24,019
vulnerabilities or on you know

1415
00:55:24,019 --> 00:55:26,970
cryptographic issues or encryption

1416
00:55:26,970 --> 00:55:29,730
problems because of the threat model of

1417
00:55:29,730 --> 00:55:31,559
that application each time that you

1418
00:55:31,559 --> 00:55:32,940
perform a code review you're going to be

1419
00:55:32,940 --> 00:55:34,200
doing some sort of a threat model up

1420
00:55:34,200 --> 00:55:35,700
front that's what the initial discussion

1421
00:55:35,700 --> 00:55:38,490
is about that so this list may or may

1422
00:55:38,490 --> 00:55:39,960
not you may or may not get through all

1423
00:55:39,960 --> 00:55:41,730
of it I mean we did in this case but

1424
00:55:41,730 --> 00:55:42,900
we're looking at the different functions

1425
00:55:42,900 --> 00:55:44,460
that are concerning to us right the

1426
00:55:44,460 --> 00:55:47,190
upload function download forgot password

1427
00:55:47,190 --> 00:55:48,599
reset password that's authentication

1428
00:55:48,599 --> 00:55:51,299
we're identifying users the search

1429
00:55:51,299 --> 00:55:53,190
function because maybe we can get it to

1430
00:55:53,190 --> 00:55:54,779
return more data than we then is

1431
00:55:54,779 --> 00:55:56,670
necessary or maybe there's you know

1432
00:55:56,670 --> 00:55:58,200
we're know there's some sort of sequin

1433
00:55:58,200 --> 00:55:59,609
or interaction that's going on there

1434
00:55:59,609 --> 00:56:01,890
settings right what why is there

1435
00:56:01,890 --> 00:56:03,150
settings there maybe there's something

1436
00:56:03,150 --> 00:56:05,069
that we can manipulate the sensitive

1437
00:56:05,069 --> 00:56:08,309
data exposure that's a that is that

1438
00:56:08,309 --> 00:56:11,190
could be relevant there so each of the

1439
00:56:11,190 --> 00:56:13,349
endpoints actually maps to that and then

1440
00:56:13,349 --> 00:56:14,940
we have been file mapping those are

1441
00:56:14,940 --> 00:56:16,849
important files that we pull out of the

1442
00:56:16,849 --> 00:56:18,960
application itself or the application

1443
00:56:18,960 --> 00:56:21,420
source that may or may not correspond to

1444
00:56:21,420 --> 00:56:26,099
a direct route yeah I think that covers

1445
00:56:26,099 --> 00:56:33,059
the mapping section Ken okay awesome

1446
00:56:33,059 --> 00:56:35,789
yeah I don't know what else there is to

1447
00:56:35,789 --> 00:56:38,809
sort of reiterate here other than like

1448
00:56:38,809 --> 00:56:44,670
you are okay like Seth said you build

1449
00:56:44,670 --> 00:56:46,559
you build a list of the important files

1450
00:56:46,559 --> 00:56:49,349
that you want to review you you build a

1451
00:56:49,349 --> 00:56:50,700
list of the important routes you want to

1452
00:56:50,700 --> 00:56:53,609
view and you build a list of things you

1453
00:56:53,609 --> 00:56:57,170
know you need to be looking for like

1454
00:56:57,170 --> 00:57:01,529
before you end your assessment so for

1455
00:57:01,529 --> 00:57:02,970
instance we've talked about some of the

1456
00:57:02,970 --> 00:57:06,079
like command injection sequel injection

1457
00:57:06,079 --> 00:57:09,599
exercise things that are like maybe

1458
00:57:09,599 --> 00:57:12,239
unscoped fine lookups things like that

1459
00:57:12,239 --> 00:57:16,559
that you should be doing before you end

1460
00:57:16,559 --> 00:57:18,480
your assessment now if you've done this

1461
00:57:18,480 --> 00:57:21,329
this gives you at least some and again

1462
00:57:21,329 --> 00:57:23,309
like we're we're taking I mean we're

1463
00:57:23,309 --> 00:57:24,779
already when we do this course we're

1464
00:57:24,779 --> 00:57:27,089
taking over a decade of experience each

1465
00:57:27,089 --> 00:57:27,759
per

1466
00:57:27,759 --> 00:57:30,039
I mean two decades over two decades of

1467
00:57:30,039 --> 00:57:32,559
experience between us putting it into

1468
00:57:32,559 --> 00:57:34,719
you know two or three day course and in

1469
00:57:34,719 --> 00:57:36,309
this case we're putting all into an hour

1470
00:57:36,309 --> 00:57:39,130
so super condensed version probably a

1471
00:57:39,130 --> 00:57:40,959
lot of context left out of here but

1472
00:57:40,959 --> 00:57:49,569
mainly the point is is to like Bill dang

1473
00:57:49,569 --> 00:57:53,649
it again if you can't get to it that's

1474
00:57:53,649 --> 00:57:56,559
gonna be yeah you there yeah all right

1475
00:57:56,559 --> 00:57:58,149
I'm just gonna stop talking I think I'm

1476
00:57:58,149 --> 00:57:59,979
I think I'm done my Wi-Fi is just not

1477
00:57:59,979 --> 00:58:03,039
playing nice it doesn't doesn't like you

1478
00:58:03,039 --> 00:58:04,119
today for some reason

1479
00:58:04,119 --> 00:58:07,599
no I oh yeah I think I think Ann was

1480
00:58:07,599 --> 00:58:09,429
saying is that you know we're trying to

1481
00:58:09,429 --> 00:58:11,409
give you a process that you can use and

1482
00:58:11,409 --> 00:58:12,729
a checklist that you can use to actually

1483
00:58:12,729 --> 00:58:15,880
step through on each of these you know

1484
00:58:15,880 --> 00:58:18,459
we'll provide the slides it'll go and

1485
00:58:18,459 --> 00:58:20,109
we've actually got a white paper that we

1486
00:58:20,109 --> 00:58:21,819
put out on this as well so we'll provide

1487
00:58:21,819 --> 00:58:23,799
that over it'll step through each of the

1488
00:58:23,799 --> 00:58:25,449
things that we've talked about but also

1489
00:58:25,449 --> 00:58:27,549
it'll dive deeper into it okay this is

1490
00:58:27,549 --> 00:58:28,389
what you want to look for in

1491
00:58:28,389 --> 00:58:30,669
authentication and authorization so as

1492
00:58:30,669 --> 00:58:32,229
you build out your checklist items you

1493
00:58:32,229 --> 00:58:33,909
can be fairly confident that you are

1494
00:58:33,909 --> 00:58:35,859
reviewing the things the vulnerabilities

1495
00:58:35,859 --> 00:58:37,499
that apply to each of those different

1496
00:58:37,499 --> 00:58:40,359
kind of overarching security principles

1497
00:58:40,359 --> 00:58:43,149
that you should be looking at I mean

1498
00:58:43,149 --> 00:58:44,399
obviously you've got your like

1499
00:58:44,399 --> 00:58:46,299
confidentiality integrity and

1500
00:58:46,299 --> 00:58:49,059
availability triad you've got your

1501
00:58:49,059 --> 00:58:50,049
Triple A your authorization

1502
00:58:50,049 --> 00:58:52,149
authentication and auditing that you're

1503
00:58:52,149 --> 00:58:53,499
all going to be looking at when you

1504
00:58:53,499 --> 00:58:55,779
perform a review but you want to make

1505
00:58:55,779 --> 00:58:57,429
sure that you are checking for the

1506
00:58:57,429 --> 00:58:59,439
vulnerabilities that are relevant for

1507
00:58:59,439 --> 00:59:00,849
your application and that's why this

1508
00:59:00,849 --> 00:59:03,009
checklist is so important is you want to

1509
00:59:03,009 --> 00:59:04,929
build that as you look at the

1510
00:59:04,929 --> 00:59:06,519
application as you map it out and then

1511
00:59:06,519 --> 00:59:07,899
you want to go back through and perform

1512
00:59:07,899 --> 00:59:11,979
each of those reviews yeah I'd like we

1513
00:59:11,979 --> 00:59:13,689
didn't really get into any of the actual

1514
00:59:13,689 --> 00:59:15,399
like review items themselves and the

1515
00:59:15,399 --> 00:59:18,009
specifics but this is the that's the

1516
00:59:18,009 --> 00:59:19,209
general framework that we're talking

1517
00:59:19,209 --> 00:59:21,639
about go back to the circle-k framework

1518
00:59:21,639 --> 00:59:23,619
and the actions that you perform go back

1519
00:59:23,619 --> 00:59:25,599
to the methodology so that you are

1520
00:59:25,599 --> 00:59:27,009
understanding the application and

1521
00:59:27,009 --> 00:59:28,719
actually building out the review items

1522
00:59:28,719 --> 00:59:31,029
before you jump in it's very easy to go

1523
00:59:31,029 --> 00:59:32,529
down the rabbit hole and actually look

1524
00:59:32,529 --> 00:59:35,049
at things before you really understand

1525
00:59:35,049 --> 00:59:36,519
how the application works and that's

1526
00:59:36,519 --> 00:59:37,719
what you want to prevent the more time

1527
00:59:37,719 --> 00:59:39,099
that you spend upfront getting to know

1528
00:59:39,099 --> 00:59:41,160
the application the better your code

1529
00:59:41,160 --> 00:59:43,920
review is going to be and I think that

1530
00:59:43,920 --> 00:59:46,740
probably summarizes it at least as much

1531
00:59:46,740 --> 00:59:48,990
as we're gonna be able to today Sam in

1532
00:59:48,990 --> 00:59:51,780
an hour so I hope it was somewhat useful

1533
00:59:51,780 --> 00:59:53,970
to you or at least interesting were

1534
00:59:53,970 --> 00:59:55,950
there questions we never even asked that

1535
00:59:55,950 --> 01:00:04,559
were there any questions that was when

1536
01:00:04,559 --> 01:00:17,700
is your sort of training and yeah so

1537
01:00:17,700 --> 01:00:19,940
we've got a couple of them coming up so

1538
01:00:19,940 --> 01:00:23,609
both the global app SEC DC global app

1539
01:00:23,609 --> 01:00:25,710
SEC Amsterdam we're offering the

1540
01:00:25,710 --> 01:00:28,349
training the two day well two days at DC

1541
01:00:28,349 --> 01:00:30,390
three days at Amsterdam we're excited

1542
01:00:30,390 --> 01:00:31,559
about the three day one because it'll

1543
01:00:31,559 --> 01:00:33,180
give us more time actually dig in and

1544
01:00:33,180 --> 01:00:36,510
give people our hands on AB sec day in

1545
01:00:36,510 --> 01:00:39,630
Melbourne that's in October blackhat

1546
01:00:39,630 --> 01:00:41,970
Europe in December we'll be doing it

1547
01:00:41,970 --> 01:00:44,460
there but you can hit us up like the

1548
01:00:44,460 --> 01:00:47,579
resources like we give this away right

1549
01:00:47,579 --> 01:00:51,450
it's not this is not a secret right like

1550
01:00:51,450 --> 01:00:53,339
we want people people to be able to do

1551
01:00:53,339 --> 01:00:55,650
this so if you hit us up we'll share out

1552
01:00:55,650 --> 01:00:58,289
the document the slides with you as far

1553
01:00:58,289 --> 01:01:01,410
as the process itself hit us up on

1554
01:01:01,410 --> 01:01:03,750
Twitter I'm at Seth Law Ken's at CK

1555
01:01:03,750 --> 01:01:06,900
tricky you can you know ask us questions

1556
01:01:06,900 --> 01:01:09,990
hit up hit up our DMS I'm gonna join the

1557
01:01:09,990 --> 01:01:12,450
podcast whatever it is any of those ways

1558
01:01:12,450 --> 01:01:14,609
because we want you to be successful at

1559
01:01:14,609 --> 01:01:17,190
this we spend a lot of time spinning our

1560
01:01:17,190 --> 01:01:19,230
wheels on code reviews and it's not fun

1561
01:01:19,230 --> 01:01:21,630
like we know that it's not fun to spend

1562
01:01:21,630 --> 01:01:22,829
a whole bunch of time doing something

1563
01:01:22,829 --> 01:01:25,260
that isn't super effective so that I

1564
01:01:25,260 --> 01:01:26,609
think those are the places that you can

1565
01:01:26,609 --> 01:01:28,170
find us like at least over the next

1566
01:01:28,170 --> 01:01:30,690
three months but we're also we're also

1567
01:01:30,690 --> 01:01:32,430
at conferences and everything else but

1568
01:01:32,430 --> 01:01:33,930
if you follow us on twitter you'll see

1569
01:01:33,930 --> 01:01:39,720
it yes yes definitely definitely we

1570
01:01:39,720 --> 01:01:41,069
should yeah

1571
01:01:41,069 --> 01:01:43,200
we've got one more question and just

1572
01:01:43,200 --> 01:01:45,510
about specific tools and that might be

1573
01:01:45,510 --> 01:01:46,680
able to help when you're doing manual

1574
01:01:46,680 --> 01:01:48,779
code reviews specifically when the app

1575
01:01:48,779 --> 01:01:51,270
SEC team to dam ratio is high like is

1576
01:01:51,270 --> 01:01:52,170
there any specific

1577
01:01:52,170 --> 01:01:54,260
would help with manual pay-per-views

1578
01:01:54,260 --> 01:01:57,900
skating that process scaling that

1579
01:01:57,900 --> 01:02:00,059
process and manual code reviews I mean I

1580
01:02:00,059 --> 01:02:01,740
think the the most efficient thing that

1581
01:02:01,740 --> 01:02:06,180
we've seen is actually using like github

1582
01:02:06,180 --> 01:02:08,790
and JIRA to track what's going on and

1583
01:02:08,790 --> 01:02:11,309
sharing the data back out so you see how

1584
01:02:11,309 --> 01:02:13,680
can actually like they actually document

1585
01:02:13,680 --> 01:02:15,000
that and throw that into the github

1586
01:02:15,000 --> 01:02:17,670
issue when they're doing the review so

1587
01:02:17,670 --> 01:02:19,770
that you can see what's going on like

1588
01:02:19,770 --> 01:02:21,510
again it shouldn't be a secret from the

1589
01:02:21,510 --> 01:02:23,069
developers what you're doing when you're

1590
01:02:23,069 --> 01:02:25,530
reviewing the code the more that you

1591
01:02:25,530 --> 01:02:27,390
actually use those kind of development

1592
01:02:27,390 --> 01:02:28,589
tools that are out there the better off

1593
01:02:28,589 --> 01:02:30,690
you're going to be the other thing that

1594
01:02:30,690 --> 01:02:33,720
I find incredibly useful is using the

1595
01:02:33,720 --> 01:02:37,049
IDE that the developers are using right

1596
01:02:37,049 --> 01:02:39,540
and you know it's very easy to be like

1597
01:02:39,540 --> 01:02:41,940
oh I've got Adam installed I should be

1598
01:02:41,940 --> 01:02:43,500
able to view any code that's out there

1599
01:02:43,500 --> 01:02:45,660
but guess what if you're doing a Java

1600
01:02:45,660 --> 01:02:48,210
you know spring code review and you're

1601
01:02:48,210 --> 01:02:50,910
not actually pulling that up in you know

1602
01:02:50,910 --> 01:02:54,510
whatever IDE the developers are using

1603
01:02:54,510 --> 01:02:56,670
you're not going to have the same level

1604
01:02:56,670 --> 01:02:58,619
of expertise and actually viewing that

1605
01:02:58,619 --> 01:03:00,720
source that the developers do and you're

1606
01:03:00,720 --> 01:03:02,819
gonna miss things right so if you're

1607
01:03:02,819 --> 01:03:04,799
yeah if you're developing dot you know

1608
01:03:04,799 --> 01:03:06,900
or you if you're looking at a dotnet

1609
01:03:06,900 --> 01:03:10,260
core application use Visual Studio yes I

1610
01:03:10,260 --> 01:03:12,359
know it costs money as a consultant but

1611
01:03:12,359 --> 01:03:14,660
it's gonna be worth it in the long run

1612
01:03:14,660 --> 01:03:16,920
and that's not to say that we don't use

1613
01:03:16,920 --> 01:03:18,420
some of the automated tools right at

1614
01:03:18,420 --> 01:03:23,190
times like Ken mentioned brakeman right

1615
01:03:23,190 --> 01:03:25,260
for rails or some of the open source

1616
01:03:25,260 --> 01:03:26,609
ones that are out there like Java suck

1617
01:03:26,609 --> 01:03:29,970
find bugs Puma scan for dotnet there's

1618
01:03:29,970 --> 01:03:31,410
tools that are out there that actually

1619
01:03:31,410 --> 01:03:32,910
speed things up and give you cleaners

1620
01:03:32,910 --> 01:03:35,099
just don't depend on that solely that's

1621
01:03:35,099 --> 01:03:38,010
that's my that's my automated tool

1622
01:03:38,010 --> 01:03:47,160
speech and again but which ticks there

1623
01:03:47,160 --> 01:03:48,930
can be found the most security risks

1624
01:03:48,930 --> 01:03:54,890
with I'll tell you most security risks

1625
01:03:54,890 --> 01:03:58,049
Pete I said basically anything Java

1626
01:03:58,049 --> 01:03:59,670
allow yeah people

1627
01:03:59,670 --> 01:04:02,849
ok PHP wins I didn't know we were PHP

1628
01:04:02,849 --> 01:04:03,930
was making its way into this

1629
01:04:03,930 --> 01:04:05,349
conversation

1630
01:04:05,349 --> 01:04:12,099
right yeah but yeah yeah I think it's

1631
01:04:12,099 --> 01:04:13,900
whatever you've seen the most that's

1632
01:04:13,900 --> 01:04:15,160
what you find the most vulnerabilities

1633
01:04:15,160 --> 01:04:18,430
in right like so it's easy for like for

1634
01:04:18,430 --> 01:04:19,869
Ken to identify vulnerabilities and

1635
01:04:19,869 --> 01:04:21,670
rails cuz these these are big Ruby rails

1636
01:04:21,670 --> 01:04:24,940
get right you know like my side like

1637
01:04:24,940 --> 01:04:27,999
Python or even like iOS I find a lot in

1638
01:04:27,999 --> 01:04:29,470
there because I've developed a lot in

1639
01:04:29,470 --> 01:04:31,539
those different frameworks and for those

1640
01:04:31,539 --> 01:04:33,670
different platforms and so like

1641
01:04:33,670 --> 01:04:35,650
definitely your expertise helped but you

1642
01:04:35,650 --> 01:04:37,809
can still find the documentation and

1643
01:04:37,809 --> 01:04:39,450
find vulnerabilities and other things so

1644
01:04:39,450 --> 01:04:42,359
so we can argue about that on Twitter

1645
01:04:42,359 --> 01:04:44,619
let's take it back to the flag thank you

1646

01:04:48,279 --> 01:04:50,109
short at me at a time but as you said

1649
01:04:50,109 --> 01:04:52,869
anyone listening and you can catch these

1650
01:04:52,869 --> 01:04:54,640
too and a lot of conferences or hit them

1651
01:04:54,640 --> 01:04:56,739
up directly or populations in the secory

1652
01:04:56,739 --> 01:04:58,539
and we can loop them in and get them

1653
01:04:58,539 --> 01:05:00,789
