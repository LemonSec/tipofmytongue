1
00:00:00,699 --> 00:00:04,549
hi everyone and welcome to these secure

2
00:00:04,549 --> 00:00:06,740
developers and really excited today

3
00:00:06,740 --> 00:00:08,900
because we have siren offender joining

4
00:00:08,900 --> 00:00:11,269
us talk to all about security and the

5
00:00:11,269 --> 00:00:13,639
developer development lifecycle before

6
00:00:13,639 --> 00:00:15,080
we get started net for those of you new

7
00:00:15,080 --> 00:00:18,289
to the community my name is Sam Hepburn

8
00:00:18,289 --> 00:00:19,640
and I'm the community manager here

9
00:00:19,640 --> 00:00:21,310
behind the scenes making things happen

10
00:00:21,310 --> 00:00:24,740
so any feedback and session ideas things

11
00:00:24,740 --> 00:00:27,140
I get please ping me if you're not

12
00:00:27,140 --> 00:00:29,359
already on our slack it's the best way

13
00:00:29,359 --> 00:00:32,570
to ask siren questions today so if you

14
00:00:32,570 --> 00:00:34,489
head over to the secure developer comm

15
00:00:34,489 --> 00:00:36,350
and click join you'll be able to join

16
00:00:36,350 --> 00:00:38,270
the slack channel join the live sessions

17
00:00:38,270 --> 00:00:39,379
tab and then you can ask questions

18
00:00:39,379 --> 00:00:41,809
interact with risk the community if you

19
00:00:41,809 --> 00:00:44,390
are watching this session after the live

20
00:00:44,390 --> 00:00:45,770
recording you can still pop your

21
00:00:45,770 --> 00:00:46,850
patience in there and we can try

22
00:00:46,850 --> 00:00:49,010
facilitate to get an answer for you so

23
00:00:49,010 --> 00:00:51,530
please join us on the flow and the other

24
00:00:51,530 --> 00:00:52,910
thing too just to make sure you're

25
00:00:52,910 --> 00:00:54,410
viewing is good if you can go to the cog

26
00:00:54,410 --> 00:00:56,149
on the bottom of your screen and turn it

27
00:00:56,149 --> 00:00:58,309
up to max and resolution it's the best

28
00:00:58,309 --> 00:01:00,710
way to do today but other than that

29
00:01:00,710 --> 00:01:02,660
that's enough for me and the session

30
00:01:02,660 --> 00:01:04,399
will be available on the security bit of

31
00:01:04,399 --> 00:01:06,549
a website a couple hours after it's

32
00:01:06,549 --> 00:01:10,340
broadcasted and that's enough for me I'm

33
00:01:10,340 --> 00:01:12,860
gonna head over to sewing hi phone

34
00:01:12,860 --> 00:01:18,110
welcome hi Sam hi everybody so this is

35
00:01:18,110 --> 00:01:20,240
like my first webinar where I can't see

36
00:01:20,240 --> 00:01:21,439
anybody but Sam

37
00:01:21,439 --> 00:01:23,930
so I'm sitting in a room by myself like

38
00:01:23,930 --> 00:01:26,840
talking to myself like a weirdo so if I

39
00:01:26,840 --> 00:01:28,820
seem a little bit weirded out it's just

40
00:01:28,820 --> 00:01:30,979
because I've like never sat and like

41
00:01:30,979 --> 00:01:33,229
ranted like a true crazy person by

42
00:01:33,229 --> 00:01:36,079
myself in a room so I didn't prepare any

43
00:01:36,079 --> 00:01:37,520
slides today and I'm not going to be

44
00:01:37,520 --> 00:01:39,890
demoing any tools at all I'm not gonna

45
00:01:39,890 --> 00:01:41,240
be talking about any frameworks really

46
00:01:41,240 --> 00:01:43,520
which is and I know that like 90% of you

47
00:01:43,520 --> 00:01:46,880
are like I'm out but the reason I'm not

48
00:01:46,880 --> 00:01:48,979
is because I want to talk a lot about

49
00:01:48,979 --> 00:01:50,810
the development lifecycle itself and

50
00:01:50,810 --> 00:01:53,600
that's from birth to death which should

51
00:01:53,600 --> 00:01:55,610
be like language and tool agnostic and

52
00:01:55,610 --> 00:01:57,409
when we're looking at security we want

53
00:01:57,409 --> 00:01:59,000
to have kind of a baseline level of

54
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:01,909
Hygiene as opposed to having as long as

55
00:02:01,909 --> 00:02:03,530
you use this language as long as you use

56
00:02:03,530 --> 00:02:05,390
that language you're gonna be fine and

57
00:02:05,390 --> 00:02:07,820
my experience in my talk at conference

58
00:02:07,820 --> 00:02:09,889
is a fair bit is that we get a lot of

59
00:02:09,889 --> 00:02:11,959
people that are like I wouldn't do that

60
00:02:11,959 --> 00:02:13,790
because I don't use that language

61
00:02:13,790 --> 00:02:15,830
I'm front-end back-end mobile server

62
00:02:15,830 --> 00:02:19,430
lists I'm s3 that's the new buzzword and

63
00:02:19,430 --> 00:02:22,010
so they kind of turn off their brain or

64
00:02:22,010 --> 00:02:24,019
they're looking at somebody exploiting a

65
00:02:24,019 --> 00:02:25,879
bug or demonstrating of vulnerability

66
00:02:25,879 --> 00:02:28,519
where they personally feel like I

67
00:02:28,519 --> 00:02:31,299
wouldn't make that mistake and this is

68
00:02:31,299 --> 00:02:34,400
where I get a lot of people talking to

69
00:02:34,400 --> 00:02:36,110
me and being like well I'd like to learn

70
00:02:36,110 --> 00:02:39,140
but I don't use that language and so

71
00:02:39,140 --> 00:02:40,400
you've kind of missed the boat because

72
00:02:40,400 --> 00:02:41,900
it's not a language that's the problem

73
00:02:41,900 --> 00:02:44,540
it's kind of the concepts so that's what

74
00:02:44,540 --> 00:02:45,620
I'm going to be talking about so if

75
00:02:45,620 --> 00:02:47,930
you're expecting slides just like

76
00:02:47,930 --> 00:02:50,569
imagine a funny photo and like just

77
00:02:50,569 --> 00:02:51,709
imagine it with me

78
00:02:51,709 --> 00:02:53,480
so I'll be thinking about a funny photo

79
00:02:53,480 --> 00:02:54,889
you can be thinking about a funny photo

80
00:02:54,889 --> 00:02:58,340
and what we go to go um but a little bit

81
00:02:58,340 --> 00:03:01,340
about me I do secure development but I

82
00:03:01,340 --> 00:03:04,129
don't actually write code I can't my

83
00:03:04,129 --> 00:03:05,599
brain doesn't work that way I've tried

84
00:03:05,599 --> 00:03:07,129
and tried to teach myself how to code

85
00:03:07,129 --> 00:03:09,379
but I just I can't I can script and I

86
00:03:09,379 --> 00:03:12,379
can read code but what I've kind of

87
00:03:12,379 --> 00:03:14,810
realized is my niche is working with

88
00:03:14,810 --> 00:03:16,819
developers to help them write better

89
00:03:16,819 --> 00:03:19,129
code so that's everything from code

90
00:03:19,129 --> 00:03:20,629
review to picking up your dry cleaning

91
00:03:20,629 --> 00:03:23,060
to getting somebody's coffee and to try

92
00:03:23,060 --> 00:03:24,260
and make that process a little bit

93
00:03:24,260 --> 00:03:27,949
easier so what I want to start with is

94
00:03:27,949 --> 00:03:29,629
kind of the idea of security in the

95
00:03:29,629 --> 00:03:32,810
development lifecycle itself and when

96
00:03:32,810 --> 00:03:35,150
most people think security in a

97
00:03:35,150 --> 00:03:37,400
development lifecycle they think pen

98
00:03:37,400 --> 00:03:39,560
testing because this is what a lot of

99
00:03:39,560 --> 00:03:41,569
people's experience with security is it

100
00:03:41,569 --> 00:03:43,220
is the end result it is somebody

101
00:03:43,220 --> 00:03:46,970
attacking a system and this is where we

102
00:03:46,970 --> 00:03:48,829
get a lot of security tooling for you

103
00:03:48,829 --> 00:03:51,109
know wasp top ten find your

104
00:03:51,109 --> 00:03:53,389
vulnerabilities find your exploits find

105
00:03:53,389 --> 00:03:56,180
your whatever it is which becomes really

106
00:03:56,180 --> 00:03:58,069
really problematic because I've never

107
00:03:58,069 --> 00:04:00,470
met a developer that's just a pure

108
00:04:00,470 --> 00:04:02,239
developer that's learned how to do that

109
00:04:02,239 --> 00:04:05,269
by how to break things first you learn

110
00:04:05,269 --> 00:04:07,989
how to build things in a secure manner

111
00:04:07,989 --> 00:04:11,690
secure here being it works it's on you

112
00:04:11,690 --> 00:04:13,790
can see a front-end your back-end is on

113
00:04:13,790 --> 00:04:15,769
you know something is talking to

114
00:04:15,769 --> 00:04:18,649
something else so secure in this

115
00:04:18,649 --> 00:04:21,019
perspective is it works and this is

116
00:04:21,019 --> 00:04:22,550
where you can look at building a house

117
00:04:22,550 --> 00:04:26,000
if I were to build a house in an area

118
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:27,120
that's really

119
00:04:27,120 --> 00:04:30,330
hurricane-prone I'm going to know that's

120
00:04:30,330 --> 00:04:32,010
a hurricane prone area because I'm a

121
00:04:32,010 --> 00:04:33,540
house builder and so therefore I'll be

122
00:04:33,540 --> 00:04:35,100
building my house to withstand a

123
00:04:35,100 --> 00:04:37,380
hurricane I won't know if it does that

124
00:04:37,380 --> 00:04:40,680
until a hurricane actually shows up but

125
00:04:40,680 --> 00:04:43,080
I have to take those environments into

126
00:04:43,080 --> 00:04:45,180
account when I'm building my house does

127
00:04:45,180 --> 00:04:47,790
that make me a secure architect probably

128
00:04:47,790 --> 00:04:51,780
not it makes me a decent architect but

129
00:04:51,780 --> 00:04:53,729
when we're looking at security we we

130
00:04:53,729 --> 00:04:55,639
come at it from an attackers perspective

131
00:04:55,639 --> 00:04:58,320
why do we do this because the attackers

132
00:04:58,320 --> 00:05:00,150
perspective is more buzzword media

133
00:05:00,150 --> 00:05:04,650
friendly and it sounds cooler so it

134
00:05:04,650 --> 00:05:06,960
becomes an easier and I'm sorry if

135
00:05:06,960 --> 00:05:08,940
you're a salesperson that this is gonna

136
00:05:08,940 --> 00:05:10,470
sound really insulting but it makes it

137
00:05:10,470 --> 00:05:12,389
easier to sell because real security

138
00:05:12,389 --> 00:05:15,150
work honestly it's not as flashy and

139
00:05:15,150 --> 00:05:16,889
sexy I think it's fascinating and my

140
00:05:16,889 --> 00:05:18,419
hope is that other people can find it

141
00:05:18,419 --> 00:05:20,880
fascinating with me but being like we're

142
00:05:20,880 --> 00:05:23,160
gonna have a base level of Hygiene with

143
00:05:23,160 --> 00:05:27,539
like a solid unit test baseline or we're

144
00:05:27,539 --> 00:05:29,039
gonna attack your systems think like a

145
00:05:29,039 --> 00:05:32,190
hacker you know yeah it's the commercial

146
00:05:32,190 --> 00:05:34,110
for like cleaning the bathroom or like

147
00:05:34,110 --> 00:05:37,620
attacking the system I know which one is

148
00:05:37,620 --> 00:05:39,990
gonna draw more clicks and that's where

149
00:05:39,990 --> 00:05:42,990
most of sales goes where can we get in

150
00:05:42,990 --> 00:05:45,780
the money so putting all of that aside

151
00:05:45,780 --> 00:05:48,450
what does real secure development

152
00:05:48,450 --> 00:05:52,560
actually look like so on slack Sam you

153
00:05:52,560 --> 00:05:53,639
can kind of raise him does anyone

154
00:05:53,639 --> 00:05:56,070
actually like no does anyone have like a

155
00:05:56,070 --> 00:05:58,380
good way to like freeze it I'm not

156
00:05:58,380 --> 00:05:59,400
looking at the slack I'm just like

157
00:05:59,400 --> 00:06:00,810
staring at myself like a weirdo so I

158
00:06:00,810 --> 00:06:05,999
don't actually know there'll be a say

159
00:06:05,999 --> 00:06:11,719
behind us so let us see if anyone knows

160
00:06:27,849 --> 00:06:44,589
with new simon on the channel says he

161
00:06:44,589 --> 00:06:45,520
feels it's different for different

162
00:06:45,520 --> 00:06:48,759
people that's actually a really really

163
00:06:48,759 --> 00:06:50,469
good answer and i'm really stoked about

164
00:06:50,469 --> 00:06:52,869
it because i think this is where like

165
00:06:52,869 --> 00:06:55,179
our first stumbling block comes in which

166
00:06:55,179 --> 00:06:56,889
is why i didn't want to talk about tools

167
00:06:56,889 --> 00:06:58,360
or language because it is different for

168
00:06:58,360 --> 00:07:00,550
everybody and so the security of the are

169
00:07:00,550 --> 00:07:01,749
going to be offering to a back-end

170
00:07:01,749 --> 00:07:03,249
developer versus a front-end developer

171
00:07:03,249 --> 00:07:05,080
is not going to be the same type of

172
00:07:05,080 --> 00:07:07,059
security which means the things that

173
00:07:07,059 --> 00:07:08,169
they're going to be focusing on are

174
00:07:08,169 --> 00:07:10,929
completely different and it also assumes

175
00:07:10,929 --> 00:07:13,059
that everybody is going to have the same

176
00:07:13,059 --> 00:07:15,490
kind of level of effort the same type of

177
00:07:15,490 --> 00:07:18,099
passion and let's be honest passion as a

178
00:07:18,099 --> 00:07:20,379
privileged but when we're looking at

179
00:07:20,379 --> 00:07:22,779
security nobody comes to work thinking i

180
00:07:22,779 --> 00:07:25,479
want to do a bad job no one comes to

181
00:07:25,479 --> 00:07:27,189
work being like you know what i think

182
00:07:27,189 --> 00:07:31,269
clear text md5 you know no having no

183
00:07:31,269 --> 00:07:33,129
throttling all the traffic all of the

184
00:07:33,129 --> 00:07:35,019
time is a good idea like nobody does

185
00:07:35,019 --> 00:07:35,289
that

186
00:07:35,289 --> 00:07:38,019
but where one person may think you know

187
00:07:38,019 --> 00:07:40,329
encryption and you know validation

188
00:07:40,329 --> 00:07:41,860
frameworks are really interesting the

189
00:07:41,860 --> 00:07:43,899
next person doesn't and so you have to

190
00:07:43,899 --> 00:07:45,369
make sure that you have a base level

191
00:07:45,369 --> 00:07:47,919
hygiene factor that caters to everybody

192
00:07:47,919 --> 00:07:50,499
because looking at what good security is

193
00:07:50,499 --> 00:07:53,199
it's actually the idea of making it easy

194
00:07:53,199 --> 00:07:56,099
to make the right types of choices and

195
00:07:56,099 --> 00:07:58,179
this is where we can look at something

196
00:07:58,179 --> 00:08:00,069
that apples done just face ID

197
00:08:00,069 --> 00:08:03,039
now when phase ID came out there was a

198
00:08:03,039 --> 00:08:05,349
lot of you know twitter oh my god oh my

199
00:08:05,349 --> 00:08:07,719
god face ID north korea is gonna hack my

200
00:08:07,719 --> 00:08:10,409
face and there are a lot of really

201
00:08:10,409 --> 00:08:12,969
frightening articles about the idea of

202
00:08:12,969 --> 00:08:15,579
the 3d mask you know somebody can make a

203
00:08:15,579 --> 00:08:18,429
scan of your face and then they can get

204
00:08:18,429 --> 00:08:22,809
into your phone and i would just like to

205
00:08:22,809 --> 00:08:24,939
wonder like how many people is that a

206
00:08:24,939 --> 00:08:27,749
real risk like if you're a high

207
00:08:27,749 --> 00:08:30,999
political person if you're some sort of

208
00:08:30,999 --> 00:08:33,849
you know really important someone where

209
00:08:33,849 --> 00:08:35,438
you have a lot of information on your

210
00:08:35,438 --> 00:08:36,938
phone that may be something you can take

211
00:08:36,938 --> 00:08:39,399
into account me personally that's not

212
00:08:39,399 --> 00:08:40,940
something i worry about on a date

213
00:08:40,940 --> 00:08:43,789
basis where my mom is a really good

214
00:08:43,789 --> 00:08:46,250
example because even though I've been

215
00:08:46,250 --> 00:08:48,080
her daughter's for all of my life she'd

216
00:08:48,080 --> 00:08:49,880
never had a lock on her phone because

217
00:08:49,880 --> 00:08:51,500
she's not good with numbers so she's not

218
00:08:51,500 --> 00:08:53,000
good with remembering pin codes and

219
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:55,880
things and so for her daily life having

220
00:08:55,880 --> 00:08:57,920
a pin code on her phone was such a

221
00:08:57,920 --> 00:09:00,260
problem that she didn't have one with

222
00:09:00,260 --> 00:09:02,690
face ID she actually has secured her

223
00:09:02,690 --> 00:09:05,690
phone in a way that works for her does

224
00:09:05,690 --> 00:09:07,640
it mean that my mom is not deserving of

225
00:09:07,640 --> 00:09:09,380
a level of security absolutely not it

226
00:09:09,380 --> 00:09:11,180
means the security has to change to fit

227
00:09:11,180 --> 00:09:13,700
the reality of the person using it we

228
00:09:13,700 --> 00:09:15,050
can see this a lot when we look at

229
00:09:15,050 --> 00:09:16,700
development because we're catering to

230
00:09:16,700 --> 00:09:20,300
okay so you have to have these super

231
00:09:20,300 --> 00:09:22,100
heavy requirements we're looking at

232
00:09:22,100 --> 00:09:23,710
two-factor authentication

233
00:09:23,710 --> 00:09:25,910
two-factor authentication must be on

234
00:09:25,910 --> 00:09:28,220
everything but if you're a small

235
00:09:28,220 --> 00:09:29,720
start-up and you have to get a lot of

236
00:09:29,720 --> 00:09:31,790
customers in and your two-factor is

237
00:09:31,790 --> 00:09:33,980
killing your conversion rate if your

238
00:09:33,980 --> 00:09:35,780
conversion rate is directly resulting in

239
00:09:35,780 --> 00:09:37,400
you getting salary at the end of the

240
00:09:37,400 --> 00:09:40,010
month does it have to be two-factor

241
00:09:40,010 --> 00:09:42,140
authentication on all of the systems can

242
00:09:42,140 --> 00:09:43,670
you use something like device tokens

243
00:09:43,670 --> 00:09:45,290
instead could you use better session

244
00:09:45,290 --> 00:09:47,870
management so it can't be just kind of a

245
00:09:47,870 --> 00:09:50,450
blanket you must if we're looking at

246
00:09:50,450 --> 00:09:52,850
security from you know the dawn of time

247
00:09:52,850 --> 00:09:55,460
where you have the compliance person in

248
00:09:55,460 --> 00:09:57,680
the suit we are the Department of no and

249
00:09:57,680 --> 00:09:59,630
this is where a lot of those types of

250
00:09:59,630 --> 00:10:01,070
fears come from I need a lot of

251
00:10:01,070 --> 00:10:03,650
developers and like oh I want to go

252
00:10:03,650 --> 00:10:05,450
towards continuous in creation I want to

253
00:10:05,450 --> 00:10:07,010
learn agile I want to have you know an

254
00:10:07,010 --> 00:10:08,330
autonomous team and make my own

255
00:10:08,330 --> 00:10:11,150
decisions but I have fear security

256
00:10:11,150 --> 00:10:13,970
showing up and saying no and this is

257
00:10:13,970 --> 00:10:15,710
where we come back to the idea of we

258
00:10:15,710 --> 00:10:17,030
have to have a different level of

259
00:10:17,030 --> 00:10:19,550
security for everybody so it's more the

260
00:10:19,550 --> 00:10:21,980
idea of having the encourage developers

261
00:10:21,980 --> 00:10:25,190
to make smart security choices you hire

262
00:10:25,190 --> 00:10:27,950
smart people so security is function is

263
00:10:27,950 --> 00:10:29,660
actually to empower them to make smart

264
00:10:29,660 --> 00:10:31,190
choices and bring up the idea of

265
00:10:31,190 --> 00:10:35,300
visibility so most developers do a lot

266
00:10:35,300 --> 00:10:38,150
of security work already most developers

267
00:10:38,150 --> 00:10:40,640
know how to implement HTTPS most

268
00:10:40,640 --> 00:10:42,500
developers know how to implement an

269
00:10:42,500 --> 00:10:44,540
encryption standard that isn't MDF eyes

270
00:10:44,540 --> 00:10:47,630
most developers can identify spaghetti

271
00:10:47,630 --> 00:10:50,000
code when they see it I don't know if

272
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:52,100
spaghetti code is like an a global thing

273
00:10:52,100 --> 00:10:53,570
but it's basically crack code

274
00:10:53,570 --> 00:10:55,330
most people know

275
00:10:55,330 --> 00:10:57,370
where you know they're if they're

276
00:10:57,370 --> 00:10:59,080
integrating against the service and it's

277
00:10:59,080 --> 00:11:01,800
been built by you know God only knows

278
00:11:01,800 --> 00:11:04,630
that that's not a system I want to touch

279
00:11:04,630 --> 00:11:06,610
or you have to make sure that you have

280
00:11:06,610 --> 00:11:08,860
this one particular setting in this one

281
00:11:08,860 --> 00:11:11,290
particular area so you may have some

282
00:11:11,290 --> 00:11:13,120
extra redundancy all of those things are

283
00:11:13,120 --> 00:11:16,690
actually security requirements that are

284
00:11:16,690 --> 00:11:20,110
already being done but because we had

285
00:11:20,110 --> 00:11:22,329
this red team offensive you know we're

286
00:11:22,329 --> 00:11:23,950
going to be attacking systems all of

287
00:11:23,950 --> 00:11:25,600
those things aren't actually identified

288
00:11:25,600 --> 00:11:27,490
so when are looking at development

289
00:11:27,490 --> 00:11:30,310
lifecycle tips one of the very first

290
00:11:30,310 --> 00:11:31,930
things you want to start looking at is

291
00:11:31,930 --> 00:11:33,610
what are the security in the tasks that

292
00:11:33,610 --> 00:11:36,040
I'm already doing and this is where

293
00:11:36,040 --> 00:11:37,209
we're going to get to the first tip of

294
00:11:37,209 --> 00:11:40,329
the day don't know there are a lot of

295
00:11:40,329 --> 00:11:42,190
really good standards out there you can

296
00:11:42,190 --> 00:11:45,070
have NIST and you can have sans but the

297
00:11:45,070 --> 00:11:46,779
one I actually want to highlight is one

298
00:11:46,779 --> 00:11:51,060
called a SPS and mas vs and they're two

299
00:11:51,060 --> 00:11:53,230
requirement standards m-miss for the

300
00:11:53,230 --> 00:11:56,140
mobile and ASVs is not obviously they're

301
00:11:56,140 --> 00:11:58,390
on github you can fork them and they're

302
00:11:58,390 --> 00:12:00,459
out there are a bunch of different types

303
00:12:00,459 --> 00:12:04,660
of requirements that are automated tests

304
00:12:04,660 --> 00:12:06,579
and requirements built in and there are

305
00:12:06,579 --> 00:12:08,500
three different levels so if you are a

306
00:12:08,500 --> 00:12:10,180
developer that you're working on your

307
00:12:10,180 --> 00:12:12,490
authentication schema you can look at

308
00:12:12,490 --> 00:12:15,070
something like a SBS and pick out oh but

309
00:12:15,070 --> 00:12:17,290
I already do I already check that all of

310
00:12:17,290 --> 00:12:19,089
my all of the pages that are behind

311
00:12:19,089 --> 00:12:21,550
login that you actually have to be

312
00:12:21,550 --> 00:12:23,950
logged in to view that page I actually

313
00:12:23,950 --> 00:12:25,779
check that when you know you're logged

314
00:12:25,779 --> 00:12:28,930
out if you have a run round robin the

315
00:12:28,930 --> 00:12:32,050
deck round robin set up at your server

316
00:12:32,050 --> 00:12:33,579
environment that if you log out on

317
00:12:33,579 --> 00:12:35,800
server a server see that handles the

318
00:12:35,800 --> 00:12:37,899
logout function will set tell server a

319
00:12:37,899 --> 00:12:39,640
hey you know we're actually logged out

320
00:12:39,640 --> 00:12:41,079
so it'll actually clean up your sessions

321
00:12:41,079 --> 00:12:42,329
and in a correct way

322
00:12:42,329 --> 00:12:45,190
rather than kind of being like I have to

323
00:12:45,190 --> 00:12:48,430
find a bug this will give you these are

324
00:12:48,430 --> 00:12:50,230
the actual security requirements at the

325
00:12:50,230 --> 00:12:52,630
technical level to not only increase

326
00:12:52,630 --> 00:12:54,399
your own competence in doing security

327
00:12:54,399 --> 00:12:55,750
but enable you to talk to the security

328
00:12:55,750 --> 00:12:58,180
department in a way that is their

329
00:12:58,180 --> 00:13:00,279
language that gives you kind of the

330
00:13:00,279 --> 00:13:01,899
ability to push back because this is

331
00:13:01,899 --> 00:13:04,589
where security and developers need to be

332
00:13:04,589 --> 00:13:08,079
on a more equal playing field because so

333
00:13:08,079 --> 00:13:09,240
often we're coming out one

334
00:13:09,240 --> 00:13:10,950
another from an adversarial perspective

335
00:13:10,950 --> 00:13:12,899
security shows up and hey we're not

336
00:13:12,899 --> 00:13:14,850
using these tools we're not using these

337
00:13:14,850 --> 00:13:16,800
standards therefore you're doing nothing

338
00:13:16,800 --> 00:13:18,720
and they're meeting developers that are

339
00:13:18,720 --> 00:13:21,990
already working 40 hours a week how can

340
00:13:21,990 --> 00:13:25,130
we then have a positive relationship if

341
00:13:25,130 --> 00:13:27,630
40 hours a week you're not using these

342
00:13:27,630 --> 00:13:29,160
tools therefore you're not doing

343
00:13:29,160 --> 00:13:31,589
anything that's simply not true so one

344
00:13:31,589 --> 00:13:32,850
of the first things I always tell

345
00:13:32,850 --> 00:13:34,680
developers has helped me to understand

346
00:13:34,680 --> 00:13:36,120
the things that you're already doing

347
00:13:36,120 --> 00:13:39,209
great so we're using you know a known

348
00:13:39,209 --> 00:13:41,790
encryption standard we already have a

349
00:13:41,790 --> 00:13:43,380
good understanding of how were handling

350
00:13:43,380 --> 00:13:45,540
keys we already have a good

351
00:13:45,540 --> 00:13:47,880
understanding of you know the integrated

352
00:13:47,880 --> 00:13:50,040
services and how we maintain them we

353
00:13:50,040 --> 00:13:51,750
already have a good understanding of

354
00:13:51,750 --> 00:13:53,370
what packages we already have a good

355
00:13:53,370 --> 00:13:55,459
understanding of all of these things

356
00:13:55,459 --> 00:13:57,839
let's make sure that those things are

357
00:13:57,839 --> 00:14:01,380
visible first and then it's you and me

358
00:14:01,380 --> 00:14:02,610
together the developers being my

359
00:14:02,610 --> 00:14:04,290
left-hand security being my right hands

360
00:14:04,290 --> 00:14:07,860
these are my slides so yeah let's make

361
00:14:07,860 --> 00:14:09,390
sure that we kind of have a meeting of

362
00:14:09,390 --> 00:14:12,510
the minds so that the compliance or the

363
00:14:12,510 --> 00:14:14,700
regulatory of the security risks that

364
00:14:14,700 --> 00:14:16,260
I'm trying to handle that you can help

365
00:14:16,260 --> 00:14:18,540
me to meet those okay so we can't have

366
00:14:18,540 --> 00:14:21,600
you know the standard NIST recommended

367
00:14:21,600 --> 00:14:23,870
whatever it is in this particular area

368
00:14:23,870 --> 00:14:26,130
area then we can look at something like

369
00:14:26,130 --> 00:14:28,560
risk acceptance how can lead together

370
00:14:28,560 --> 00:14:30,660
security and developers make the

371
00:14:30,660 --> 00:14:32,070
business aware of why that isn't

372
00:14:32,070 --> 00:14:34,980
possible and so that becomes an accepted

373
00:14:34,980 --> 00:14:38,190
risk from the business and if it is not

374
00:14:38,190 --> 00:14:39,600
an acceptable risk then let's use

375
00:14:39,600 --> 00:14:41,700
security's big stick because we do have

376
00:14:41,700 --> 00:14:43,589
one to make sure that developers

377
00:14:43,589 --> 00:14:47,579
actually get time to fix it but it's a

378
00:14:47,579 --> 00:14:50,040
two-way street because if you're

379
00:14:50,040 --> 00:14:52,260
approaching it from you know security is

380
00:14:52,260 --> 00:14:53,820
only here to make our life awful and

381
00:14:53,820 --> 00:14:55,350
Security's approaching it from you're

382
00:14:55,350 --> 00:14:56,850
not doing it in this standard way

383
00:14:56,850 --> 00:14:58,920
therefore you're not doing anything that

384
00:14:58,920 --> 00:15:01,950
is never going to create be a productive

385
00:15:01,950 --> 00:15:04,290
relationship but to have that

386
00:15:04,290 --> 00:15:05,700
conversation you have to make sure that

387
00:15:05,700 --> 00:15:07,320
the developers have the ability to

388
00:15:07,320 --> 00:15:10,020
actually gain the confidence to have

389
00:15:10,020 --> 00:15:11,700
that conversation in the product of way

390
00:15:11,700 --> 00:15:13,320
and this is where something like a SAS

391
00:15:13,320 --> 00:15:15,420
or ma SDS becomes really really helpful

392
00:15:15,420 --> 00:15:17,640
because it's really granular and it

393
00:15:17,640 --> 00:15:19,050
gives you the ability to say okay so

394
00:15:19,050 --> 00:15:20,180
we're at a level

395
00:15:20,180 --> 00:15:21,500
right now when it comes to our

396
00:15:21,500 --> 00:15:23,930
requirements in our testing but the data

397
00:15:23,930 --> 00:15:25,760
type or the type of business we are we

398
00:15:25,760 --> 00:15:28,280
need to be at a level three these are

399
00:15:28,280 --> 00:15:29,810
the steps that we can take to get there

400
00:15:29,810 --> 00:15:31,790
together and it will mean that we have

401
00:15:31,790 --> 00:15:34,520
to have you know X amount of more hours

402
00:15:34,520 --> 00:15:36,560
X amount of more people whatever the

403
00:15:36,560 --> 00:15:39,590
case may be more coffee more whatever

404
00:15:39,590 --> 00:15:41,300
the case and then you can bring that to

405
00:15:41,300 --> 00:15:42,530
your security department and get

406
00:15:42,530 --> 00:15:45,230
assistance with that particular area but

407
00:15:45,230 --> 00:15:46,790
it means that you're having a productive

408
00:15:46,790 --> 00:15:50,090
conversation of security has a job to do

409
00:15:50,090 --> 00:15:51,860
developers are already doing part of it

410
00:15:51,860 --> 00:15:53,360
let's find a creative way to solve that

411
00:15:53,360 --> 00:16:01,840
problem so step one visibility step two

412
00:16:01,840 --> 00:16:05,990
it's still visibility the next I know I

413
00:16:05,990 --> 00:16:07,990
know it's it's a weird stepping process

414
00:16:07,990 --> 00:16:11,930
so when we're looking at security a lot

415
00:16:11,930 --> 00:16:14,360
of the times the security team isn't the

416
00:16:14,360 --> 00:16:16,070
team that's built the first line of code

417
00:16:16,070 --> 00:16:17,120
they're being brought into an

418
00:16:17,120 --> 00:16:20,030
environment that's existed for one year

419
00:16:20,030 --> 00:16:23,360
two years five years twenty years and so

420
00:16:23,360 --> 00:16:25,940
all of that code is not in the most

421
00:16:25,940 --> 00:16:29,060
beautiful amazing it's all been

422
00:16:29,060 --> 00:16:30,890
refactored it's all been kept up to date

423
00:16:30,890 --> 00:16:34,130
it's been maintained by you know they're

424
00:16:34,130 --> 00:16:36,650
it's not 90% of it is probably like oh

425
00:16:36,650 --> 00:16:38,420
god don't look at it because we found

426
00:16:38,420 --> 00:16:40,460
the new Cole library and so we're

427
00:16:40,460 --> 00:16:42,170
keeping it together with nuts and you

428
00:16:42,170 --> 00:16:43,880
know bolts and tape and the hopes and

429
00:16:43,880 --> 00:16:46,190
dreams of small children and so that can

430
00:16:46,190 --> 00:16:47,960
be really really scary if you're looking

431
00:16:47,960 --> 00:16:49,910
at it from a K I'm a developer I've

432
00:16:49,910 --> 00:16:51,770
looked at these standards how can I make

433
00:16:51,770 --> 00:16:54,440
an effective difference because now you

434
00:16:54,440 --> 00:16:56,120
know I've waved my hand in the air to

435
00:16:56,120 --> 00:16:59,090
say I'm doing something but 90% of what

436
00:16:59,090 --> 00:16:59,810
I'm working with

437
00:16:59,810 --> 00:17:02,420
if you breathed on it too hard it will

438
00:17:02,420 --> 00:17:05,329
fall over and that can be really really

439
00:17:05,329 --> 00:17:07,339
difficult because you'll only have 40

440
00:17:07,339 --> 00:17:09,290
hours a week that you're paid for I know

441
00:17:09,290 --> 00:17:11,359
that some people are you know evening

442
00:17:11,359 --> 00:17:13,339
and weekend warriors myself among them

443
00:17:13,339 --> 00:17:15,980
but I try and also encourage a healthy

444
00:17:15,980 --> 00:17:17,630
work-life balance which means that you

445
00:17:17,630 --> 00:17:21,230
40 hours a week people so how can it

446
00:17:21,230 --> 00:17:22,430
make how can you make an effective

447
00:17:22,430 --> 00:17:25,849
difference so you know I could validate

448
00:17:25,849 --> 00:17:28,010
all of my inputs because that is truly

449
00:17:28,010 --> 00:17:31,340
and you can do best but if you have 10

450
00:17:31,340 --> 00:17:33,740
million input fields doing those one

451
00:17:33,740 --> 00:17:37,550
time can be really really hard so how

452
00:17:37,550 --> 00:17:38,840
can you actually make an effective

453
00:17:38,840 --> 00:17:40,580
difference because otherwise it can

454
00:17:40,580 --> 00:17:42,380
definitely feel like screaming into the

455
00:17:42,380 --> 00:17:45,170
night and I have been there and I have

456
00:17:45,170 --> 00:17:47,600
felt that darkness and it's a scary

457
00:17:47,600 --> 00:17:50,240
place to be and so this is where you can

458
00:17:50,240 --> 00:17:51,620
look at something like threat modeling

459
00:17:51,620 --> 00:17:54,470
from a visibility perspective so how can

460
00:17:54,470 --> 00:17:56,059
you use something like threat modeling

461
00:17:56,059 --> 00:17:57,860
and risk assessments to look at legacy

462
00:17:57,860 --> 00:18:00,830
code in order to kind of prioritize what

463
00:18:00,830 --> 00:18:03,650
you want to be doing now I know that

464
00:18:03,650 --> 00:18:06,050
probably somewhere in one of the slack

465
00:18:06,050 --> 00:18:07,520
channels some developers sitting there

466
00:18:07,520 --> 00:18:08,600
being like you're gonna ask for an

467
00:18:08,600 --> 00:18:10,790
architectural diagram and I release my

468
00:18:10,790 --> 00:18:13,970
stuff 80 times a week and documentation

469
00:18:13,970 --> 00:18:15,920
gets dusty and I don't want to do it

470
00:18:15,920 --> 00:18:18,890
because it will be you know legacy the

471
00:18:18,890 --> 00:18:20,150
instant I write it and you're absolutely

472
00:18:20,150 --> 00:18:20,750
right

473
00:18:20,750 --> 00:18:23,150
I am NOT gonna argue your point at all

474
00:18:23,150 --> 00:18:25,130
because you're completely correct this

475
00:18:25,130 --> 00:18:27,590
is where you have to say how can we keep

476
00:18:27,590 --> 00:18:30,650
an architectural diagram in some form up

477
00:18:30,650 --> 00:18:32,870
to date there are a lot of cool things

478
00:18:32,870 --> 00:18:34,370
that you can do low-key using a service

479
00:18:34,370 --> 00:18:35,840
like threat dragon where you can check

480
00:18:35,840 --> 00:18:38,720
in architecture with your code you can

481
00:18:38,720 --> 00:18:40,280
also have architectural diagrams on a

482
00:18:40,280 --> 00:18:42,440
post-it note so this isn't something

483
00:18:42,440 --> 00:18:44,330
that needs to be it must be in this

484
00:18:44,330 --> 00:18:47,390
particular way but in some way you will

485
00:18:47,390 --> 00:18:49,429
have a larger drawing of the system in

486
00:18:49,429 --> 00:18:51,020
some form and if you don't have that

487
00:18:51,020 --> 00:18:52,820
this is where you can run to your

488
00:18:52,820 --> 00:18:55,220
security department and get their big

489
00:18:55,220 --> 00:18:57,010
stick and take this fight together

490
00:18:57,010 --> 00:18:59,090
because that larger architectural

491
00:18:59,090 --> 00:19:00,770
diagram will be in a lot of their work

492
00:19:00,770 --> 00:19:03,110
for a lot of privacy assessments a lot

493
00:19:03,110 --> 00:19:04,610
of data protection and impact

494
00:19:04,610 --> 00:19:06,650
assessments a lot of article 30 a lot of

495
00:19:06,650 --> 00:19:08,420
their work will require a larger

496
00:19:08,420 --> 00:19:10,460
architectural drawing and a larger

497
00:19:10,460 --> 00:19:12,800
architectural understanding and so if

498
00:19:12,800 --> 00:19:14,510
you don't have time to do that this is

499
00:19:14,510 --> 00:19:15,710
somewhere where you can kind of

500
00:19:15,710 --> 00:19:17,090
collaborate with the security to make

501
00:19:17,090 --> 00:19:19,100
sure you have that time to actually get

502
00:19:19,100 --> 00:19:19,610
it done

503
00:19:19,610 --> 00:19:21,800
that being said don't let the security

504
00:19:21,800 --> 00:19:24,170
department run you over with it has to

505
00:19:24,170 --> 00:19:25,910
be a diagram it has to look like this

506
00:19:25,910 --> 00:19:27,380
and it has to have all of these parts

507
00:19:27,380 --> 00:19:30,050
because continuous integration and

508
00:19:30,050 --> 00:19:32,030
security at speed is where we all want

509
00:19:32,030 --> 00:19:35,390
to go so therefore no developer wants to

510
00:19:35,390 --> 00:19:37,070
spend you know three hours a week

511
00:19:37,070 --> 00:19:39,950
maintaining a documentation sack that's

512
00:19:39,950 --> 00:19:42,530
not realistic but there are a lot of

513
00:19:42,530 --> 00:19:44,630
good creative solutions and we're all

514
00:19:44,630 --> 00:19:47,149
very smart people so how can we find a

515
00:19:47,149 --> 00:19:49,279
good way to actually do that this is

516
00:19:49,279 --> 00:19:50,509
where you can look at a tool like

517
00:19:50,509 --> 00:19:53,059
security rat which is an automated

518
00:19:53,059 --> 00:19:54,589
security requirements tool that you can

519
00:19:54,589 --> 00:19:56,210
check-in into your continuous deployment

520
00:19:56,210 --> 00:19:59,089
pipeline where you've identified assets

521
00:19:59,089 --> 00:20:00,919
and you were to identify risks and you

522
00:20:00,919 --> 00:20:02,779
identify the requirements that are

523
00:20:02,779 --> 00:20:04,879
associated with them you can also check

524
00:20:04,879 --> 00:20:07,339
in you know architectural diagrams in

525
00:20:07,339 --> 00:20:08,899
something like that to keep it as a

526
00:20:08,899 --> 00:20:11,269
living document you could look at having

527
00:20:11,269 --> 00:20:13,159
threat models or architectural diagrams

528
00:20:13,159 --> 00:20:14,960
and your yeah more configuration files

529
00:20:14,960 --> 00:20:17,389
you can look at having you know a white

530
00:20:17,389 --> 00:20:19,369
board that's online that everybody has

531
00:20:19,369 --> 00:20:21,859
access to that during your you know

532
00:20:21,859 --> 00:20:24,409
Friday beer that I'm assuming basically

533
00:20:24,409 --> 00:20:26,899
all companies have a Friday beer I don't

534
00:20:26,899 --> 00:20:28,609
drink myself but I understood that this

535
00:20:28,609 --> 00:20:30,710
is like the new thing it's that in ping

536
00:20:30,710 --> 00:20:33,229
pong I don't drink beer and I don't play

537
00:20:33,229 --> 00:20:34,729
ping pong but I know that these are the

538
00:20:34,729 --> 00:20:37,549
things have a you know have a quick look

539
00:20:37,549 --> 00:20:40,119
at the whiteboard and add a smiley face

540
00:20:40,119 --> 00:20:42,710
so make sure that you're not getting

541
00:20:42,710 --> 00:20:45,139
bogged down and it has to be this but

542
00:20:45,139 --> 00:20:47,779
having an architectural view will enable

543
00:20:47,779 --> 00:20:51,169
you to say okay so we have 90% legacy

544
00:20:51,169 --> 00:20:53,269
you're saying that we have to make a you

545
00:20:53,269 --> 00:20:55,159
know a substantive difference how can we

546
00:20:55,159 --> 00:20:57,349
do that together and a lot of the time

547
00:20:57,349 --> 00:20:58,940
the answer is going to be you can't and

548
00:20:58,940 --> 00:21:01,849
this is like me not being doom and gloom

549
00:21:01,849 --> 00:21:04,070
it's the reality the situation you only

550
00:21:04,070 --> 00:21:06,109
have 40 hours a week you still have to

551
00:21:06,109 --> 00:21:07,519
keep producing things because the

552
00:21:07,519 --> 00:21:09,919
business case of we're fixing old things

553
00:21:09,919 --> 00:21:14,229
old fuck-ups that we made 20 years ago

554
00:21:14,229 --> 00:21:16,460
isn't going to be great to you know

555
00:21:16,460 --> 00:21:18,200
drive in more customers or clicks or

556
00:21:18,200 --> 00:21:19,940
whatever the case may be therefore

557
00:21:19,940 --> 00:21:21,739
you're gonna be looking at something

558
00:21:21,739 --> 00:21:24,799
like mitigations now this is where

559
00:21:24,799 --> 00:21:26,269
you're going to be expecting me to bust

560
00:21:26,269 --> 00:21:28,369
out a crystal ball and look into it and

561
00:21:28,369 --> 00:21:30,649
say if we don't fix this in six months

562
00:21:30,649 --> 00:21:33,889
we will be attacked and we may or may

563
00:21:33,889 --> 00:21:36,559
not be and I am NOT gonna say that so

564
00:21:36,559 --> 00:21:38,239
rather than approach this room in six

565
00:21:38,239 --> 00:21:40,339
months something may happen look at it

566
00:21:40,339 --> 00:21:42,739
from an architectural perspective given

567
00:21:42,739 --> 00:21:44,570
that we have a problem state of 90%

568
00:21:44,570 --> 00:21:47,960
legacy what can we do to keep the 90%

569
00:21:47,960 --> 00:21:50,629
legacy from fighting us because no one

570
00:21:50,629 --> 00:21:52,309
wants to come to work and be bitten by

571
00:21:52,309 --> 00:21:54,259
mistakes that some other developer made

572
00:21:54,259 --> 00:21:55,639
and it's always some other developer

573
00:21:55,639 --> 00:21:57,259
even if it was you I'm gonna give you

574
00:21:57,259 --> 00:21:59,289
the space of it was somebody else

575
00:21:59,289 --> 00:22:00,710
that

576
00:22:00,710 --> 00:22:02,360
how can we make sure that's mitigated

577
00:22:02,360 --> 00:22:04,190
because we're never gonna have time to

578
00:22:04,190 --> 00:22:05,570
finish all of those mistakes it's the

579
00:22:05,570 --> 00:22:07,760
reality of the situation but what you

580
00:22:07,760 --> 00:22:09,590
could do is let's bring in some

581
00:22:09,590 --> 00:22:12,380
consultants to do the crappy refactoring

582
00:22:12,380 --> 00:22:14,779
let's have you know a week where we all

583
00:22:14,779 --> 00:22:17,539
do it together with pizza let's figure

584
00:22:17,539 --> 00:22:19,820
out how to make sure that if this falls

585
00:22:19,820 --> 00:22:22,159
over it won't hit us as hard and if it's

586
00:22:22,159 --> 00:22:23,870
not possible and in some cases it's not

587
00:22:23,870 --> 00:22:26,990
it's just a sandwich sorry I'm so

588
00:22:26,990 --> 00:22:27,289
sorry

589
00:22:27,289 --> 00:22:30,020
I swear I'm so sorry I I am very

590
00:22:30,020 --> 00:22:31,610
unprofessional I'm also here in a onesie

591
00:22:31,610 --> 00:22:33,200
if you're wondering what I'm wearing I'm

592
00:22:33,200 --> 00:22:36,200
literally wearing a onesie ah yeah

593
00:22:36,200 --> 00:22:40,730
it's all professional all day how can we

594
00:22:40,730 --> 00:22:41,960
make sure that the business is aware of

595
00:22:41,960 --> 00:22:43,940
that because I think there are a few

596
00:22:43,940 --> 00:22:46,370
things that are as horrifying as being

597
00:22:46,370 --> 00:22:48,890
the person that knows that you know the

598
00:22:48,890 --> 00:22:51,140
problem is over there and feeling like

599
00:22:51,140 --> 00:22:54,500
that's on you so this is where you can

600
00:22:54,500 --> 00:22:56,330
go - sorry was there a question or are

601
00:22:56,330 --> 00:22:57,770
we just kind of breathing me yeah no

602
00:22:57,770 --> 00:22:59,809
actually there was a question I didn't

603
00:22:59,809 --> 00:23:01,940
want to stop your fly and we actually

604
00:23:01,940 --> 00:23:03,140
have a few questions

605
00:23:03,140 --> 00:23:06,980
and so brent has asked he wants to know

606
00:23:06,980 --> 00:23:08,510
what your opinion is on the best way to

607
00:23:08,510 --> 00:23:10,460
find sort of budget for time resources

608
00:23:10,460 --> 00:23:13,880
people and to get the development team

609
00:23:13,880 --> 00:23:16,010
even started on secure software and sort

610
00:23:16,010 --> 00:23:17,330
of following from that is how do you

611
00:23:17,330 --> 00:23:19,370
even change the mindset of the developer

612
00:23:19,370 --> 00:23:22,159
to make them one to start and writing

613
00:23:22,159 --> 00:23:25,250
sort of and delivering secure code so I

614
00:23:25,250 --> 00:23:26,990
would say they already are and I think

615
00:23:26,990 --> 00:23:28,669
this is where like the big minds that

616
00:23:28,669 --> 00:23:30,350
comes in because everybody already is

617
00:23:30,350 --> 00:23:32,659
and one of the biggest challenges is

618
00:23:32,659 --> 00:23:36,340
you're coming to developers who don't

619
00:23:36,340 --> 00:23:38,720
don't know what secure code means

620
00:23:38,720 --> 00:23:40,539
because they think it's something else

621
00:23:40,539 --> 00:23:45,409
it's not it is you know HTTP it is

622
00:23:45,409 --> 00:23:46,909
making sure your keys are handled

623
00:23:46,909 --> 00:23:49,159
correctly it is validation inputs and a

624
00:23:49,159 --> 00:23:50,779
lot of developers are already doing

625
00:23:50,779 --> 00:23:52,490
those things it's giving them the

626
00:23:52,490 --> 00:23:54,770
ability to see that those are real

627
00:23:54,770 --> 00:23:57,440
security improvements we saw this a lot

628
00:23:57,440 --> 00:23:59,510
when you know performance it used to be

629
00:23:59,510 --> 00:24:01,130
something that another department cared

630
00:24:01,130 --> 00:24:03,230
about same thing with testing it was

631
00:24:03,230 --> 00:24:04,640
somebody else's problem

632
00:24:04,640 --> 00:24:06,260
same thing with operations and

633
00:24:06,260 --> 00:24:07,580
deployment it was somebody else's

634
00:24:07,580 --> 00:24:09,799
problem but now we have DevOps we have

635
00:24:09,799 --> 00:24:11,840
kind of a more focus on developers doing

636
00:24:11,840 --> 00:24:13,940
testing we have kind of performance in

637
00:24:13,940 --> 00:24:14,390
the Natura

638
00:24:14,390 --> 00:24:16,550
life cycle so I would say the first

639
00:24:16,550 --> 00:24:18,440
thing before you even get to kind of

640
00:24:18,440 --> 00:24:20,870
writing secure code is you want to

641
00:24:20,870 --> 00:24:22,820
switch that to what are we actually

642
00:24:22,820 --> 00:24:25,310
doing hey we're really good at making

643
00:24:25,310 --> 00:24:26,630
sure that our ciphers are up-to-date

644
00:24:26,630 --> 00:24:28,940
we're really good at handling our

645
00:24:28,940 --> 00:24:30,980
certificates we're really good at these

646
00:24:30,980 --> 00:24:32,960
because that way rather than approaching

647
00:24:32,960 --> 00:24:35,240
it from we're doing nothing it's let's

648
00:24:35,240 --> 00:24:36,530
build on the things that we're already

649
00:24:36,530 --> 00:24:37,310
doing

650
00:24:37,310 --> 00:24:40,420
okay so we don't actually know how

651
00:24:40,420 --> 00:24:42,950
certificates and the PKI works okay

652
00:24:42,950 --> 00:24:44,480
that's great that's an educational

653
00:24:44,480 --> 00:24:46,670
improvement that we can make we have a

654
00:24:46,670 --> 00:24:49,370
PKI system how can it work let's hire in

655
00:24:49,370 --> 00:24:51,020
a consultant let's do a class let's read

656
00:24:51,020 --> 00:24:53,240
a book to learn more about PKI together

657
00:24:53,240 --> 00:24:55,370
but it's already there it's already

658
00:24:55,370 --> 00:24:57,410
running so clearly we're not starting

659
00:24:57,410 --> 00:25:01,070
from you know square zero if like zero

660
00:25:01,070 --> 00:25:04,460
and a half because that approach means

661
00:25:04,460 --> 00:25:05,810
that you're going to somebody saying

662
00:25:05,810 --> 00:25:07,460
you're already competent you're not a

663
00:25:07,460 --> 00:25:09,620
complete idiot let me help you get

664
00:25:09,620 --> 00:25:10,910
better at what you're already doing

665
00:25:10,910 --> 00:25:11,960
because that's a much easier

666
00:25:11,960 --> 00:25:15,050
conversation then you have 40 hours a

667
00:25:15,050 --> 00:25:17,150
week now you have to do something else

668
00:25:17,150 --> 00:25:19,730
so it's you have 40 hours you're still

669
00:25:19,730 --> 00:25:21,920
gonna have 40 hours but now you're more

670
00:25:21,920 --> 00:25:24,080
confident because you're doing security

671
00:25:24,080 --> 00:25:26,930
stuff too and it's like it's the big

672
00:25:26,930 --> 00:25:28,850
buzzword does that kind of answer your

673
00:25:28,850 --> 00:25:32,930
question he said I think so yeah

674
00:25:32,930 --> 00:25:33,590
definitely

675
00:25:33,590 --> 00:25:35,150
and sort of following on from that and a

676
00:25:35,150 --> 00:25:36,170
little bit about what you touched on

677
00:25:36,170 --> 00:25:37,880
earlier about sort of speaking to the

678
00:25:37,880 --> 00:25:41,120
security team and we have Brian who asks

679
00:25:41,120 --> 00:25:43,850
do you think the security people need to

680
00:25:43,850 --> 00:25:46,310
code in your opinion I'm a speaker

681
00:25:46,310 --> 00:25:47,990
actually advocated for this quite a bit

682
00:25:47,990 --> 00:25:50,810
so like what's your opinion on those

683
00:25:50,810 --> 00:25:55,460
security needs of code I don't I think

684
00:25:55,460 --> 00:25:57,290
that security people come in all shapes

685
00:25:57,290 --> 00:26:00,170
and sizes and I work I have security

686
00:26:00,170 --> 00:26:02,030
developers on my team I have a security

687
00:26:02,030 --> 00:26:03,860
architect on my team but I also have

688
00:26:03,860 --> 00:26:05,750
people that don't code on my team very

689
00:26:05,750 --> 00:26:09,230
specifically the what I hire for first

690
00:26:09,230 --> 00:26:11,510
and foremost is always empathy because

691
00:26:11,510 --> 00:26:13,490
our job is to be a supporting function

692
00:26:13,490 --> 00:26:15,890
and we're a good supporting function by

693
00:26:15,890 --> 00:26:18,050
being empathetic and helping other

694
00:26:18,050 --> 00:26:20,570
people to do their job better that can

695
00:26:20,570 --> 00:26:22,610
be having somebody on the security team

696
00:26:22,610 --> 00:26:24,380
that loves documentation if you have a

697
00:26:24,380 --> 00:26:26,990
lot of compliance like gdpr having

698
00:26:26,990 --> 00:26:28,039
someone on the security

699
00:26:28,039 --> 00:26:30,049
that this documentation is the best

700
00:26:30,049 --> 00:26:31,700
thing ever saying dear developers

701
00:26:31,700 --> 00:26:34,129
alright talk to this person for 15

702
00:26:34,129 --> 00:26:35,929
minutes a week and they will do all of

703
00:26:35,929 --> 00:26:38,379
your documentation that's a huge win

704
00:26:38,379 --> 00:26:40,999
having someone on your team that can

705
00:26:40,999 --> 00:26:43,070
write you know security automation tests

706
00:26:43,070 --> 00:26:45,859
is also a huge win so I would say it's a

707
00:26:45,859 --> 00:26:48,710
mistake to say that only you can only do

708
00:26:48,710 --> 00:26:50,749
security if you code because that's

709
00:26:50,749 --> 00:26:52,700
saying that the only thing of value to a

710
00:26:52,700 --> 00:26:54,169
business is code and that's simply not

711
00:26:54,169 --> 00:26:58,039
true but depending on the types of

712
00:26:58,039 --> 00:26:59,659
developers and what their needs are it

713
00:26:59,659 --> 00:27:03,049
may be a really important skill but you

714
00:27:03,049 --> 00:27:05,239
wrong also run the risk of you have a

715
00:27:05,239 --> 00:27:06,739
developer core that would really like to

716
00:27:06,739 --> 00:27:08,899
have security as a focus you might have

717
00:27:08,899 --> 00:27:09,979
someone that would like to get into the

718
00:27:09,979 --> 00:27:12,259
field having someone that does security

719
00:27:12,259 --> 00:27:14,210
code might strip them of that ability

720
00:27:14,210 --> 00:27:17,119
and lower their own ownership in in the

721
00:27:17,119 --> 00:27:20,239
field so I know that's kind of a there's

722
00:27:20,239 --> 00:27:22,039
a trend of saying you don't do security

723
00:27:22,039 --> 00:27:24,379
if you can't code I would argue I've

724
00:27:24,379 --> 00:27:26,269
been doing it for 12 years and I don't

725
00:27:26,269 --> 00:27:29,149
code I can script really well but I

726
00:27:29,149 --> 00:27:32,119
can't write code but I've been

727
00:27:32,119 --> 00:27:34,369
incredibly blessed to be surrounded by

728
00:27:34,369 --> 00:27:37,460
lots and lots of developers who can so

729
00:27:37,460 --> 00:27:40,279
it's I see myself as a part of a larger

730
00:27:40,279 --> 00:27:47,210
environment that is all the questions we

731
00:27:47,210 --> 00:27:49,279
have a Clement said what a carry on yes

732
00:27:49,279 --> 00:27:52,539
so we were on we were on threat modeling

733
00:27:52,539 --> 00:27:55,580
so we've got a threat model and then we

734
00:27:55,580 --> 00:27:57,830
have a long list of risks like these are

735
00:27:57,830 --> 00:27:59,570
where our demons lay this is the legacy

736
00:27:59,570 --> 00:28:01,849
that we can't take care of this is also

737
00:28:01,849 --> 00:28:03,499
where developers can kind of come

738
00:28:03,499 --> 00:28:04,729
together with their security team and

739
00:28:04,729 --> 00:28:07,729
say ok so we have our 40 hours we can't

740
00:28:07,729 --> 00:28:09,799
fix this and you're telling us it's a

741
00:28:09,799 --> 00:28:13,489
big problem do we run screaming to a pen

742
00:28:13,489 --> 00:28:14,989
tester what what is the next natural

743
00:28:14,989 --> 00:28:17,690
step the next natural step is actually

744
00:28:17,690 --> 00:28:19,220
going to risk acceptance which is not

745
00:28:19,220 --> 00:28:21,859
code related because a developer and a

746
00:28:21,859 --> 00:28:23,169
security team boots on the ground

747
00:28:23,169 --> 00:28:25,849
they're not the person that says you

748
00:28:25,849 --> 00:28:27,409
know this is an acceptable risk that's

749
00:28:27,409 --> 00:28:31,759
the CEO that's the CEO CEO OCIO someone

750
00:28:31,759 --> 00:28:34,249
with you know that has a high pay grade

751
00:28:34,249 --> 00:28:37,399
or a lot of letters in their title or is

752
00:28:37,399 --> 00:28:39,379
just you know the first person to

753
00:28:39,379 --> 00:28:41,570
slaughter needs to accept it from the

754
00:28:41,570 --> 00:28:43,999
business perspective because otherwise

755
00:28:43,999 --> 00:28:46,460
it's developers taking decisions that

756
00:28:46,460 --> 00:28:49,389
they don't have the ability to fix and

757
00:28:49,389 --> 00:28:51,769
this is where it kind of leads back into

758
00:28:51,769 --> 00:28:53,570
how do you get people in budget this is

759
00:28:53,570 --> 00:28:57,109
where people need to look above code I

760
00:28:57,109 --> 00:28:58,789
think it's Kevin penny

761
00:28:58,789 --> 00:29:02,509
I'm his last name escapes me but he says

762
00:29:02,509 --> 00:29:04,099
that good code is from the wire up to

763
00:29:04,099 --> 00:29:06,200
the person and I think a lot of people

764
00:29:06,200 --> 00:29:08,359
kind of get bogged down in you know the

765
00:29:08,359 --> 00:29:11,239
business doesn't care about security but

766
00:29:11,239 --> 00:29:12,679
the business isn't aware of the risks

767
00:29:12,679 --> 00:29:15,169
are actually taking so once you have a

768
00:29:15,169 --> 00:29:16,999
good understanding of kind of the larger

769
00:29:16,999 --> 00:29:18,590
picture make sure the business

770
00:29:18,590 --> 00:29:21,259
understands that if you have someone in

771
00:29:21,259 --> 00:29:22,730
your team that's good business speak

772
00:29:22,730 --> 00:29:24,080
that's good at you know PowerPoint

773
00:29:24,080 --> 00:29:25,999
slides don't call me I'm not that person

774
00:29:25,999 --> 00:29:28,369
if you have someone in the security team

775
00:29:28,369 --> 00:29:29,869
or if you have a team leader or a

776
00:29:29,869 --> 00:29:32,059
project leader make sure that they can

777
00:29:32,059 --> 00:29:34,369
present that topic so that someone you

778
00:29:34,369 --> 00:29:37,099
know of the right pay grade says this is

779
00:29:37,099 --> 00:29:39,139
OK because otherwise you're going to

780
00:29:39,139 --> 00:29:41,059
have the business saying security is

781
00:29:41,059 --> 00:29:42,799
super important but not important enough

782
00:29:42,799 --> 00:29:44,599
to invest time money or effort of people

783
00:29:44,599 --> 00:29:47,659
into it so it's going to be a developer

784
00:29:47,659 --> 00:29:49,669
who can't hire another person despite

785
00:29:49,669 --> 00:29:52,309
how much he or she may want to knowing

786
00:29:52,309 --> 00:29:54,080
about a problem and feeling ownership

787
00:29:54,080 --> 00:29:55,369
for the problem without actually being

788
00:29:55,369 --> 00:29:58,609
able to solve it and it's a crappy

789
00:29:58,609 --> 00:30:02,000
crappy not fun Kody way

790
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:04,130
but it means that if the businesses hey

791
00:30:04,130 --> 00:30:07,040
we're not okay with 98% of our product

792
00:30:07,040 --> 00:30:08,690
being built of you know the hopes and

793
00:30:08,690 --> 00:30:11,540
dreams of small children that's fine

794
00:30:11,540 --> 00:30:13,880
then they need to give the developer

795
00:30:13,880 --> 00:30:16,340
core eight more people eight new tools

796
00:30:16,340 --> 00:30:18,500
lots of training whatever the case may

797
00:30:18,500 --> 00:30:20,450
be but they can't on the one hand say

798
00:30:20,450 --> 00:30:22,430
it's important but on the other hand say

799
00:30:22,430 --> 00:30:23,990
not important enough to actually invest

800
00:30:23,990 --> 00:30:27,440
and that can't be a developer decision

801
00:30:27,440 --> 00:30:29,960
which goes against kind of the new trend

802
00:30:29,960 --> 00:30:32,980
of you know autonomous teams but

803
00:30:32,980 --> 00:30:35,240
autonomous teams also live in a larger

804
00:30:35,240 --> 00:30:37,370
environment autonomous teams often

805
00:30:37,370 --> 00:30:38,690
aren't in charge of their own budget

806
00:30:38,690 --> 00:30:39,740
they're not in charge of you know

807
00:30:39,740 --> 00:30:42,020
business goals and strategies so it's

808
00:30:42,020 --> 00:30:43,640
not to say they're autonomous to the

809
00:30:43,640 --> 00:30:45,020
point of they're running the business by

810
00:30:45,020 --> 00:30:46,940
themselves but autonomy can also be

811
00:30:46,940 --> 00:30:49,370
ownership of this is where our ownership

812
00:30:49,370 --> 00:30:51,710
stops our ownership is handing it off to

813
00:30:51,710 --> 00:30:53,050
the next person

814
00:30:53,050 --> 00:30:55,760
so I know it's it's not like cool and

815
00:30:55,760 --> 00:30:57,530
we're all doing our own thing and

816
00:30:57,530 --> 00:31:01,160
startups and kombucha and ping pong but

817
00:31:01,160 --> 00:31:03,050
if we're looking at burnout which is a

818
00:31:03,050 --> 00:31:04,790
real problem within the security

819
00:31:04,790 --> 00:31:07,070
community burnout comes from hey I'm you

820
00:31:07,070 --> 00:31:08,780
know highlighting the same problem over

821
00:31:08,780 --> 00:31:11,570
and over and over and over again and no

822
00:31:11,570 --> 00:31:12,620
one is listening to me

823
00:31:12,620 --> 00:31:15,470
make sure that when you're looking at

824
00:31:15,470 --> 00:31:17,950
that void of legacy and spaghetti code

825
00:31:17,950 --> 00:31:20,480
that your first you know your first

826
00:31:20,480 --> 00:31:22,490
option is always to give it to somebody

827
00:31:22,490 --> 00:31:22,880
else

828
00:31:22,880 --> 00:31:25,400
it's a stinky mess you don't want to

829
00:31:25,400 --> 00:31:26,720
just give it away as a stinky mess and

830
00:31:26,720 --> 00:31:30,080
be like peace but say here's our stinky

831
00:31:30,080 --> 00:31:32,600
mess here's our plan to fix it and if

832
00:31:32,600 --> 00:31:34,250
they say we're fine with the stinky mess

833
00:31:34,250 --> 00:31:36,560
you're you're you know your butt is free

834
00:31:36,560 --> 00:31:38,450
because you've you know you've sounded

835
00:31:38,450 --> 00:31:40,340
the alarm if you're not the person

836
00:31:40,340 --> 00:31:43,040
that's head is gonna be cut off then

837
00:31:43,040 --> 00:31:45,830
you've done what you can and I know

838
00:31:45,830 --> 00:31:47,480
that's not it's not very you know

839
00:31:47,480 --> 00:31:49,970
startup you of me but it means that

840
00:31:49,970 --> 00:31:51,620
you're not going to be sitting there

841
00:31:51,620 --> 00:31:53,960
with you know 3:00 in the morning I know

842
00:31:53,960 --> 00:31:56,570
this problem is all down to me this is

843
00:31:56,570 --> 00:31:57,950
where you can look for a healthy

844
00:31:57,950 --> 00:32:00,020
security culture because what you want

845
00:32:00,020 --> 00:32:01,190
when you're looking at development

846
00:32:01,190 --> 00:32:03,650
lifecycle isn't I found a problem in the

847
00:32:03,650 --> 00:32:05,600
business doesn't care because that's

848
00:32:05,600 --> 00:32:08,000
rarely the case more often the cases the

849
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:10,340
business does not know which is a

850
00:32:10,340 --> 00:32:12,140
solvable problem it means that you as a

851
00:32:12,140 --> 00:32:14,210
developer have to be able to communicate

852
00:32:14,210 --> 00:32:15,320
with

853
00:32:15,320 --> 00:32:16,970
buddy in a way that they can understand

854
00:32:16,970 --> 00:32:19,850
if this is risk and risk acceptance and

855
00:32:19,850 --> 00:32:21,530
risk management it may be the security

856
00:32:21,530 --> 00:32:23,060
heat is your best ally for that

857
00:32:23,060 --> 00:32:26,060
conversation if it's if they only speak

858
00:32:26,060 --> 00:32:28,220
in slides find someone that can do

859
00:32:28,220 --> 00:32:30,560
slides but make sure that that

860
00:32:30,560 --> 00:32:32,780
conversation isn't just down to the

861
00:32:32,780 --> 00:32:35,000
person that can't fix it from a

862
00:32:35,000 --> 00:32:39,770
budgeting perspective so now we're

863
00:32:39,770 --> 00:32:43,580
getting to the coding bit which now

864
00:32:43,580 --> 00:32:44,750
people are gonna be like but you can't

865
00:32:44,750 --> 00:32:47,380
code and you're absolutely right I can't

866
00:32:47,380 --> 00:32:50,780
but I don't have to because most people

867
00:32:50,780 --> 00:32:52,520
are already doing a lot of secure coding

868
00:32:52,520 --> 00:32:55,640
already and this is where we can look -

869
00:32:55,640 --> 00:32:57,380
what does that mean these are the

870
00:32:57,380 --> 00:33:00,650
standards these are ASV SMSes bas has a

871
00:33:00,650 --> 00:33:03,590
lot of really good ones nist sans all of

872
00:33:03,590 --> 00:33:05,780
those things a lot of the code that

873
00:33:05,780 --> 00:33:08,060
you're doing is already secure if you're

874
00:33:08,060 --> 00:33:10,540
looking at you know micro-services

875
00:33:10,540 --> 00:33:12,230
microservices one of the biggest

876
00:33:12,230 --> 00:33:14,780
problems is networking and traffic it's

877
00:33:14,780 --> 00:33:16,670
a denial of service but because you have

878
00:33:16,670 --> 00:33:18,080
a distributed services all over the

879
00:33:18,080 --> 00:33:19,940
place they're going to yell so loud that

880
00:33:19,940 --> 00:33:21,740
they drown one another out and kill one

881
00:33:21,740 --> 00:33:25,070
another most developers when they're new

882
00:33:25,070 --> 00:33:27,650
to the game don't realize that and

883
00:33:27,650 --> 00:33:29,170
immediately kill their own back-end

884
00:33:29,170 --> 00:33:31,310
because it's only gonna call home you

885
00:33:31,310 --> 00:33:34,520
know every five times a minute they fall

886
00:33:34,520 --> 00:33:36,980
asleep it's 500 times a minute it gets

887
00:33:36,980 --> 00:33:38,120
deployed now there are five hundred

888
00:33:38,120 --> 00:33:40,460
things calling the backend 500 times a

889
00:33:40,460 --> 00:33:42,320
minute note the back end isn't going to

890
00:33:42,320 --> 00:33:44,510
survive you make that mistake once or

891
00:33:44,510 --> 00:33:48,350
twice and you won't do it again but that

892
00:33:48,350 --> 00:33:50,210
is you know a developer denial of

893
00:33:50,210 --> 00:33:51,680
service at attacking their own system

894
00:33:51,680 --> 00:33:53,930
and learning from that mistake you don't

895
00:33:53,930 --> 00:33:55,610
need to have you know a special sticker

896
00:33:55,610 --> 00:33:58,100
to learn from that mistake what you may

897
00:33:58,100 --> 00:34:00,320
need to understand is the wording that

898
00:34:00,320 --> 00:34:03,740
makes that more understandable which

899
00:34:03,740 --> 00:34:06,140
when you're looking at how secure coding

900
00:34:06,140 --> 00:34:09,110
is taught most the time it's not which

901
00:34:09,110 --> 00:34:11,900
becomes problematic because now you're

902
00:34:11,900 --> 00:34:13,429
at your work you don't know about the

903
00:34:13,429 --> 00:34:14,600
standards because you haven't seen my

904
00:34:14,600 --> 00:34:16,340
awesome talk with me in my pajamas and

905
00:34:16,340 --> 00:34:19,190
you look at something like wasp top 10

906
00:34:19,190 --> 00:34:21,110
which is what most pen testers are

907
00:34:21,110 --> 00:34:23,570
looking at they say you know we've run a

908
00:34:23,570 --> 00:34:25,760
lot of ten we found sequel injection

909
00:34:25,760 --> 00:34:28,879
because it's still a thing for the

910
00:34:28,879 --> 00:34:30,500
of God if somebody could just write to

911
00:34:30,500 --> 00:34:31,969
me and explain how it's still a thing

912
00:34:31,969 --> 00:34:34,789
after a million years I do not

913
00:34:34,789 --> 00:34:36,159
understand it anyway

914
00:34:36,159 --> 00:34:38,059
but if you're a front-end developer

915
00:34:38,059 --> 00:34:39,949
that's not actually going to be relevant

916
00:34:39,949 --> 00:34:42,230
for you and when you're looking at

917
00:34:42,230 --> 00:34:43,429
something like a cross-site scripting

918
00:34:43,429 --> 00:34:45,710
bug even if it is your code you're going

919
00:34:45,710 --> 00:34:47,989
to be sitting there saying I only had 40

920
00:34:47,989 --> 00:34:49,940
hours a week it had to be there because

921
00:34:49,940 --> 00:34:54,199
I had to do this because I had no choice

922
00:34:54,199 --> 00:34:56,210
and a lot of the times you're gonna be

923
00:34:56,210 --> 00:34:56,750
right

924
00:34:56,750 --> 00:35:00,049
oh well top 10 as the bugs they are a

925
00:35:00,049 --> 00:35:02,630
result they are the result they are the

926
00:35:02,630 --> 00:35:04,279
end of the lifecycle so what you

927
00:35:04,279 --> 00:35:05,630
actually want to look at is something

928
00:35:05,630 --> 00:35:09,890
called wasp top 10 proactive controls so

929
00:35:09,890 --> 00:35:11,390
if you go to off there have a list of

930
00:35:11,390 --> 00:35:13,430
proactive controls which are the things

931
00:35:13,430 --> 00:35:15,019
that are supposed to be keeping the bugs

932
00:35:15,019 --> 00:35:17,630
away from the system so these are the

933
00:35:17,630 --> 00:35:19,339
things that you can build into the

934
00:35:19,339 --> 00:35:21,200
system to keep the bugs away so going

935
00:35:21,200 --> 00:35:23,809
back to my hurricane house example you

936
00:35:23,809 --> 00:35:25,339
want to make sure that I have no idea

937
00:35:25,339 --> 00:35:26,660
how to build a house so I'm just gonna

938
00:35:26,660 --> 00:35:28,460
be wildly lying here that like the frame

939
00:35:28,460 --> 00:35:31,250
of the house is extra sturdy I'm not

940
00:35:31,250 --> 00:35:32,779
exactly sure it's raining today so I'm

941
00:35:32,779 --> 00:35:34,039
going with hurricanes it's not a

942
00:35:34,039 --> 00:35:36,140
hurricane it's just raining but these

943
00:35:36,140 --> 00:35:37,670
are the types of things that hey if you

944
00:35:37,670 --> 00:35:40,130
have you know a critical asset you may

945
00:35:40,130 --> 00:35:41,720
not want to deploy one you might want to

946
00:35:41,720 --> 00:35:44,269
deploy multiples of it if you have you

947
00:35:44,269 --> 00:35:45,890
know a key that's been compromised how

948
00:35:45,890 --> 00:35:47,569
are you gonna handle a key Noori key

949
00:35:47,569 --> 00:35:49,220
distribution if you have a certificate

950
00:35:49,220 --> 00:35:50,299
that's been poisoned how are you gonna

951
00:35:50,299 --> 00:35:51,259
handle this types of things

952
00:35:51,259 --> 00:35:53,150
all of those are controls that make sure

953
00:35:53,150 --> 00:35:54,950
that the bugs don't happen most

954
00:35:54,950 --> 00:35:57,079
developers all developers I would say

955
00:35:57,079 --> 00:35:59,869
don't want bugs to happen so looking at

956
00:35:59,869 --> 00:36:01,759
it from once the problem has already

957
00:36:01,759 --> 00:36:03,619
happened isn't actually helpful because

958
00:36:03,619 --> 00:36:05,900
that means that okay for the one input

959
00:36:05,900 --> 00:36:07,700
field in that one situation I won't do

960
00:36:07,700 --> 00:36:10,160
that again that's not helpful and that's

961
00:36:10,160 --> 00:36:11,869
not how you learn you don't learn coding

962
00:36:11,869 --> 00:36:14,630
by okay so you have to learn all of the

963
00:36:14,630 --> 00:36:16,369
examples for all the situations all of

964
00:36:16,369 --> 00:36:18,410
the time no one does that you look at it

965
00:36:18,410 --> 00:36:19,940
from an architectural and a control

966
00:36:19,940 --> 00:36:22,009
perspective when you're calling this

967
00:36:22,009 --> 00:36:24,799
type of API these are the types of

968
00:36:24,799 --> 00:36:26,420
things that you're going to be looking

969
00:36:26,420 --> 00:36:28,220
for so looking at something like

970
00:36:28,220 --> 00:36:31,190
proactive controls instead is actually a

971
00:36:31,190 --> 00:36:32,660
way that you can say any developers are

972
00:36:32,660 --> 00:36:34,339
these are the areas we're going to be

973
00:36:34,339 --> 00:36:38,660
focusing on now this is where you want

974
00:36:38,660 --> 00:36:40,309
to make sure that you have talked to the

975
00:36:40,309 --> 00:36:42,290
business about it because

976
00:36:42,290 --> 00:36:44,270
if they're saying Security's important

977
00:36:44,270 --> 00:36:47,320
how many minutes a week important is it

978
00:36:47,320 --> 00:36:49,880
because if it's a new topic and it's not

979
00:36:49,880 --> 00:36:52,010
any more minutes a week important then

980
00:36:52,010 --> 00:36:54,020
it's not important now

981
00:36:54,020 --> 00:36:56,420
no one can like miss or key fine you can

982
00:36:56,420 --> 00:36:58,190
misconstrue me but please don't that

983
00:36:58,190 --> 00:36:59,600
doesn't mean that you can like get up on

984
00:36:59,600 --> 00:37:01,910
your barricade and like if I don't get

985
00:37:01,910 --> 00:37:03,530
eight hours a week security isn't

986
00:37:03,530 --> 00:37:05,150
important that business doesn't care

987
00:37:05,150 --> 00:37:07,370
that's a ridiculous argument because

988
00:37:07,370 --> 00:37:09,230
most people are already doing security

989
00:37:09,230 --> 00:37:11,540
work but if it's a new topic if it's a

990
00:37:11,540 --> 00:37:13,970
new area you have all of the right in

991
00:37:13,970 --> 00:37:15,920
the world to say I want an extra half an

992
00:37:15,920 --> 00:37:17,870
hour to read up on how to use canary

993
00:37:17,870 --> 00:37:20,120
tokens for example what is a canary

994
00:37:20,120 --> 00:37:22,010
token mean have them using this system

995
00:37:22,010 --> 00:37:24,320
how can I learn how to do that because

996
00:37:24,320 --> 00:37:25,970
developers do this with new frameworks

997
00:37:25,970 --> 00:37:27,530
they do this with new libraries they do

998
00:37:27,530 --> 00:37:29,480
this and new integrations they can do it

999
00:37:29,480 --> 00:37:31,820
with security as well what they need to

1000
00:37:31,820 --> 00:37:33,530
be able to do is find the words to

1001
00:37:33,530 --> 00:37:35,030
integrate it back to what they're

1002
00:37:35,030 --> 00:37:37,360
already doing as opposed to being like I

1003
00:37:37,360 --> 00:37:40,180
want to do it because security is

1004
00:37:40,180 --> 00:37:43,780
important it is but it's not specific

1005
00:37:43,780 --> 00:37:46,610
it's we're doing this this is our focus

1006
00:37:46,610 --> 00:37:48,770
area these are the technical controls

1007
00:37:48,770 --> 00:37:50,090
that I'm going to be using these are the

1008
00:37:50,090 --> 00:37:51,440
frameworks I'm gonna be using this is

1009
00:37:51,440 --> 00:37:53,660
what I'm gonna be reading up on this is

1010
00:37:53,660 --> 00:37:55,100
also where you can use their security

1011
00:37:55,100 --> 00:37:57,230
team how many in minutes is it important

1012
00:37:57,230 --> 00:37:59,450
the security team can be like hey we

1013
00:37:59,450 --> 00:38:01,100
have you know compliance room you know

1014
00:38:01,100 --> 00:38:03,050
we have risk here they can help you make

1015
00:38:03,050 --> 00:38:04,850
sure that you get those extra minutes

1016
00:38:04,850 --> 00:38:07,130
they might have you know on my team I

1017
00:38:07,130 --> 00:38:08,960
have security architects and security

1018
00:38:08,960 --> 00:38:11,120
coders that can do pair programming they

1019
00:38:11,120 --> 00:38:12,650
can bring in you know technical

1020
00:38:12,650 --> 00:38:14,600
mentorship they can have security

1021
00:38:14,600 --> 00:38:16,520
champions they may already have somebody

1022
00:38:16,520 --> 00:38:19,610
that knows that that can teach you but

1023
00:38:19,610 --> 00:38:21,020
it's still giving the developer the

1024
00:38:21,020 --> 00:38:22,850
ability to say hey this is what I would

1025
00:38:22,850 --> 00:38:24,740
like to do from a proactive perspective

1026
00:38:24,740 --> 00:38:27,560
as opposed to paying someone beat me

1027
00:38:27,560 --> 00:38:29,120
over the head with a mistake that I

1028
00:38:29,120 --> 00:38:31,130
probably didn't have the ability to

1029
00:38:31,130 --> 00:38:32,650
change

1030
00:38:32,650 --> 00:38:35,540
so now you've done your coding in

1031
00:38:35,540 --> 00:38:37,520
whatever language using whatever fancy

1032
00:38:37,520 --> 00:38:40,070
framework you know react has done its

1033
00:38:40,070 --> 00:38:40,700
thing

1034
00:38:40,700 --> 00:38:43,550
whatever the case may be and now it's

1035
00:38:43,550 --> 00:38:45,800
been deployed and now we're at the

1036
00:38:45,800 --> 00:38:48,610
latest buzzword which is second DevOps

1037
00:38:48,610 --> 00:38:50,660
but we don't have DevOps anymore I think

1038
00:38:50,660 --> 00:38:53,810
it's sre and that's s re in Sec DevOps

1039
00:38:53,810 --> 00:38:55,789
and I'm sure there's some new one

1040
00:38:55,789 --> 00:38:58,059
buzzwords make me a little nauseous and

1041
00:38:58,059 --> 00:39:01,219
so nasty the idea of okay so you do a

1042
00:39:01,219 --> 00:39:03,139
deployment and then like sec DevOps like

1043
00:39:03,139 --> 00:39:06,199
ads like stick some security onto it

1044
00:39:06,199 --> 00:39:08,749
somehow and this is the exact same thing

1045
00:39:08,749 --> 00:39:09,380
again

1046
00:39:09,380 --> 00:39:11,389
DevOps already does a lot of security

1047
00:39:11,389 --> 00:39:13,819
they know what is deployed they know

1048
00:39:13,819 --> 00:39:16,399
what a secure deploy is they know what

1049
00:39:16,399 --> 00:39:18,469
can be deployed what should be deployed

1050
00:39:18,469 --> 00:39:20,329
and what packages should make up a

1051
00:39:20,329 --> 00:39:23,149
deployment if it's a new sudden package

1052
00:39:23,149 --> 00:39:26,869
they will be aware of it so having the

1053
00:39:26,869 --> 00:39:30,349
idea of oh a secure deployment I'm not

1054
00:39:30,349 --> 00:39:31,909
exactly sure what that is but I'm sure

1055
00:39:31,909 --> 00:39:33,499
there's some marketing material that

1056
00:39:33,499 --> 00:39:36,049
makes it sound a lot fancier than the

1057
00:39:36,049 --> 00:39:37,969
configuration shouldn't be changed by

1058
00:39:37,969 --> 00:39:40,549
somebody that doesn't work here our keys

1059
00:39:40,549 --> 00:39:43,549
should not be in github clear text is

1060
00:39:43,549 --> 00:39:44,509
not a good idea

1061
00:39:44,509 --> 00:39:46,819
the sessions should log out when they

1062
00:39:46,819 --> 00:39:48,589
say all of these things are

1063
00:39:48,589 --> 00:39:50,269
configuration issues or you know

1064
00:39:50,269 --> 00:39:51,859
security issues that are not

1065
00:39:51,859 --> 00:39:54,229
particularly fancy you can hear my lack

1066
00:39:54,229 --> 00:39:56,630
of marketing background here but it's

1067
00:39:56,630 --> 00:39:58,039
still the idea it's not something that

1068
00:39:58,039 --> 00:40:00,169
should be tacked on it should be these

1069
00:40:00,169 --> 00:40:02,479
are that we're deploying what we say in

1070
00:40:02,479 --> 00:40:04,339
the way that we say it and we're not

1071
00:40:04,339 --> 00:40:06,499
just throwing it over the fence to the

1072
00:40:06,499 --> 00:40:10,430
next person but now it's in production

1073
00:40:10,430 --> 00:40:12,579
[Music]

1074
00:40:12,579 --> 00:40:14,809
at which point does the developer's

1075
00:40:14,809 --> 00:40:19,099
responsibility end and I would argue yes

1076
00:40:19,099 --> 00:40:21,949
and no because I'm security so I am the

1077
00:40:21,949 --> 00:40:23,979
you know I'm in the world of gray and

1078
00:40:23,979 --> 00:40:27,469
this can be kind of odd because is it

1079
00:40:27,469 --> 00:40:30,289
only relevant once the system has been

1080
00:40:30,289 --> 00:40:31,969
attacked from a security perspective and

1081
00:40:31,969 --> 00:40:34,909
I would argue no because security has a

1082
00:40:34,909 --> 00:40:36,469
lot of functions that are supposed to

1083
00:40:36,469 --> 00:40:39,769
make it more secure but I would like to

1084
00:40:39,769 --> 00:40:41,899
be paid at the end of the month and if

1085
00:40:41,899 --> 00:40:44,089
the security is so onerous that they're

1086
00:40:44,089 --> 00:40:46,909
picking our competitors product I will

1087
00:40:46,909 --> 00:40:48,109
not be paid at the end of the month

1088
00:40:48,109 --> 00:40:49,579
because the company will collapse and

1089
00:40:49,579 --> 00:40:52,519
that will make me very sad so this can

1090
00:40:52,519 --> 00:40:54,529
also be looking at the controls that we

1091
00:40:54,529 --> 00:40:56,539
have in place are they actually

1092
00:40:56,539 --> 00:41:00,919
improving the system so how can you

1093
00:41:00,919 --> 00:41:03,409
actually do that this is where I don't

1094
00:41:03,409 --> 00:41:04,849
know if all of you have seen it but

1095
00:41:04,849 --> 00:41:07,459
everyone you if you look at like classic

1096
00:41:07,459 --> 00:41:09,080
security reports there's going to be

1097
00:41:09,080 --> 00:41:11,420
Graff in it somewhere or like a box and

1098
00:41:11,420 --> 00:41:13,190
it's gonna be high likelihood high

1099
00:41:13,190 --> 00:41:15,500
probability and it'll be a red box and

1100
00:41:15,500 --> 00:41:17,570
in the red box it'll be some stuff that

1101
00:41:17,570 --> 00:41:20,540
you should do at which point security

1102
00:41:20,540 --> 00:41:22,970
consultants will bust out a crystal ball

1103
00:41:22,970 --> 00:41:25,190
and say we should invest in this area

1104
00:41:25,190 --> 00:41:28,610
because it is in the red box and then

1105
00:41:28,610 --> 00:41:32,030
you'll invest in the area and if nothing

1106
00:41:32,030 --> 00:41:33,470
happens was it a good or a bad

1107
00:41:33,470 --> 00:41:38,090
investment you you you have no idea if

1108
00:41:38,090 --> 00:41:40,490
something bad happens did you not invest

1109
00:41:40,490 --> 00:41:43,790
enough or were you unlucky you also

1110
00:41:43,790 --> 00:41:47,360
cannot know and it becomes ridiculous

1111
00:41:47,360 --> 00:41:50,480
quite frankly because you're making a

1112
00:41:50,480 --> 00:41:52,070
bunch of investments with no actual way

1113
00:41:52,070 --> 00:41:54,200
to measure or understand what you're

1114
00:41:54,200 --> 00:41:57,170
doing so you can look at something like

1115
00:41:57,170 --> 00:42:00,740
risk forecasting instead and I know it's

1116
00:42:00,740 --> 00:42:02,030
gonna be machine learning and I'm so

1117
00:42:02,030 --> 00:42:03,080
sorry because I know that machine

1118
00:42:03,080 --> 00:42:04,100
learning has been done to death

1119
00:42:04,100 --> 00:42:08,180
so just sorry you're gonna want to look

1120
00:42:08,180 --> 00:42:09,530
at something like these are the controls

1121
00:42:09,530 --> 00:42:10,940
were actually applying in production

1122
00:42:10,940 --> 00:42:12,530
these are the things that our developers

1123
00:42:12,530 --> 00:42:14,660
have built looking at where we are now

1124
00:42:14,660 --> 00:42:16,910
looking six months ahead of time how

1125
00:42:16,910 --> 00:42:18,800
likely is it that the legacy that we

1126
00:42:18,800 --> 00:42:20,180
brought up in our threat modeling is

1127
00:42:20,180 --> 00:42:21,890
going to bite us if we don't change

1128
00:42:21,890 --> 00:42:26,060
anything as of right now and if it's a

1129
00:42:26,060 --> 00:42:28,430
hundred percent okay what are the steps

1130
00:42:28,430 --> 00:42:30,140
that we can make to make sure it doesn't

1131
00:42:30,140 --> 00:42:32,510
bite us in the next six months let's map

1132
00:42:32,510 --> 00:42:33,980
those out and let's make sure that

1133
00:42:33,980 --> 00:42:35,630
they're on our roadmap in whatever form

1134
00:42:35,630 --> 00:42:37,880
it is that way in six months when you're

1135
00:42:37,880 --> 00:42:40,640
looking back if nothing bad happened the

1136
00:42:40,640 --> 00:42:41,870
proactive steps that you've taken

1137
00:42:41,870 --> 00:42:44,780
together have actually reduced the risk

1138
00:42:44,780 --> 00:42:47,360
in a way that can be measured as opposed

1139
00:42:47,360 --> 00:42:49,850
to crystal ball gazing into the distance

1140
00:42:49,850 --> 00:42:53,660
and some sort of like wow because you're

1141
00:42:53,660 --> 00:42:55,850
doing it together as opposed to this is

1142
00:42:55,850 --> 00:42:58,070
a red box that is unclear you can do

1143
00:42:58,070 --> 00:42:59,330
with machine learning I'm not going to

1144
00:42:59,330 --> 00:43:01,610
talk about machine learning because I am

1145
00:43:01,610 --> 00:43:03,620
unqualified frankly and the people that

1146
00:43:03,620 --> 00:43:05,510
dub machine learning for Frank you know

1147
00:43:05,510 --> 00:43:07,220
risk forecasting will probably watch

1148
00:43:07,220 --> 00:43:09,710
this and laugh at me so no but it can be

1149
00:43:09,710 --> 00:43:14,030
done but two things and then I am done

1150
00:43:14,030 --> 00:43:16,340
where does pen testing come in because

1151
00:43:16,340 --> 00:43:17,750
I've mentioned it but I haven't actually

1152
00:43:17,750 --> 00:43:20,480
talked about it pen testing is the

1153
00:43:20,480 --> 00:43:22,280
result and the validation of the life

1154
00:43:22,280 --> 00:43:22,870
cycle

1155
00:43:22,870 --> 00:43:26,230
a whole so you've done your visibility

1156
00:43:26,230 --> 00:43:28,960
in the first two steps when you're

1157
00:43:28,960 --> 00:43:30,910
looking at pen testing they may have to

1158
00:43:30,910 --> 00:43:33,220
do a step 10 from a compliance or a due

1159
00:43:33,220 --> 00:43:34,720
diligence perspective but you can also

1160
00:43:34,720 --> 00:43:37,480
be hey our developer core in this

1161
00:43:37,480 --> 00:43:38,980
particular section we've really focused

1162
00:43:38,980 --> 00:43:41,680
on you know making sure that our session

1163
00:43:41,680 --> 00:43:44,170
handling is secure can you help us to

1164
00:43:44,170 --> 00:43:45,430
pen test the session handling

1165
00:43:45,430 --> 00:43:47,410
specifically looking at these things

1166
00:43:47,410 --> 00:43:49,450
we've focused on to validate that work

1167
00:43:49,450 --> 00:43:51,550
can you come in from a security

1168
00:43:51,550 --> 00:43:53,020
architecture perspective and look at our

1169
00:43:53,020 --> 00:43:54,580
risk models to see if we've missed

1170
00:43:54,580 --> 00:43:55,270
anything

1171
00:43:55,270 --> 00:43:57,250
so rather than kind of having a broad

1172
00:43:57,250 --> 00:43:59,920
sweep attacker perspective make it a

1173
00:43:59,920 --> 00:44:02,620
directive or make it a directed effort

1174
00:44:02,620 --> 00:44:04,480
to validate the work that's actually

1175
00:44:04,480 --> 00:44:06,460
being done because that way rather than

1176
00:44:06,460 --> 00:44:09,520
having a report that these are bugs that

1177
00:44:09,520 --> 00:44:11,260
another developer wrote it's every

1178
00:44:11,260 --> 00:44:13,090
developer saying hey I worked on session

1179
00:44:13,090 --> 00:44:14,620
and handling these are the bugs that

1180
00:44:14,620 --> 00:44:16,210
relate to the work that I directly did

1181
00:44:16,210 --> 00:44:18,670
this is how I can improve my day to day

1182
00:44:18,670 --> 00:44:20,980
which becomes relevant for their work

1183
00:44:20,980 --> 00:44:23,170
now I'm not saying pen testing is

1184
00:44:23,170 --> 00:44:25,150
useless I'm just saying it has two

1185
00:44:25,150 --> 00:44:27,370
different functions and it's a choice

1186
00:44:27,370 --> 00:44:29,050
that you can say I'd like to only have

1187
00:44:29,050 --> 00:44:30,340
it from a compliance due diligence

1188
00:44:30,340 --> 00:44:31,870
perspective I'm the attacker perspective

1189
00:44:31,870 --> 00:44:34,960
which is important but you can also use

1190
00:44:34,960 --> 00:44:36,520
it to empower your developers to give

1191
00:44:36,520 --> 00:44:38,200
them a better look at the work they're

1192
00:44:38,200 --> 00:44:41,220
actually doing so that they can improve

1193
00:44:41,220 --> 00:44:44,250
final point development lifecycle

1194
00:44:44,250 --> 00:44:48,190
implies death I come from a pen testing

1195
00:44:48,190 --> 00:44:51,940
background one of like the big wins that

1196
00:44:51,940 --> 00:44:53,680
I would give to companies or like the

1197
00:44:53,680 --> 00:44:56,170
big you know here you go was these are

1198
00:44:56,170 --> 00:44:57,790
the systems that you are actually using

1199
00:44:57,790 --> 00:45:00,580
which should not be a big shocker but it

1200
00:45:00,580 --> 00:45:03,130
often is I cannot tell you how many

1201
00:45:03,130 --> 00:45:05,530
companies have three or four different

1202
00:45:05,530 --> 00:45:07,600
login systems three or four different

1203
00:45:07,600 --> 00:45:10,510
CRMs three or four different whatever it

1204
00:45:10,510 --> 00:45:12,730
is with live data on them that haven't

1205
00:45:12,730 --> 00:45:14,800
been maintained because they just like

1206
00:45:14,800 --> 00:45:18,220
live there in that 90% legacy or I think

1207
00:45:18,220 --> 00:45:19,720
I said maybe I only nine percent legacy

1208
00:45:19,720 --> 00:45:23,590
of like you know dead children and like

1209
00:45:23,590 --> 00:45:26,920
leviathans and scary so when you're

1210
00:45:26,920 --> 00:45:29,020
looking at development lifecycle as a

1211
00:45:29,020 --> 00:45:31,630
developer what happens when your system

1212
00:45:31,630 --> 00:45:34,600
is no longer relevant when it comes out

1213
00:45:34,600 --> 00:45:35,810
of production

1214
00:45:35,810 --> 00:45:37,460
does that affect the configuration how

1215
00:45:37,460 --> 00:45:40,070
does that affect the integrations who

1216
00:45:40,070 --> 00:45:43,130
finds out if your develop your deploying

1217
00:45:43,130 --> 00:45:45,110
something and you're expecting a set of

1218
00:45:45,110 --> 00:45:46,840
assets and all of a sudden they're gone

1219
00:45:46,840 --> 00:45:49,130
you are gonna have to change you know

1220
00:45:49,130 --> 00:45:51,620
configurations etc that's probably a

1221
00:45:51,620 --> 00:45:53,780
good thing to know but when we're

1222
00:45:53,780 --> 00:45:55,160
looking at Agilent continuous

1223
00:45:55,160 --> 00:45:56,630
integration I've been really really

1224
00:45:56,630 --> 00:45:59,570
shocked to see that death which I don't

1225
00:45:59,570 --> 00:46:00,610
know if it's death or it's like

1226
00:46:00,610 --> 00:46:02,860
dismantling or whatever the case may be

1227
00:46:02,860 --> 00:46:05,570
it's kind of fallen away from that idea

1228
00:46:05,570 --> 00:46:08,120
where a lot of security is in those

1229
00:46:08,120 --> 00:46:10,400
systems because they're still alive they

1230
00:46:10,400 --> 00:46:12,470
can still talk to your back end and if

1231
00:46:12,470 --> 00:46:14,060
they're no longer giving the love and

1232
00:46:14,060 --> 00:46:15,590
attention from your developers and your

1233
00:46:15,590 --> 00:46:18,080
DevOps but they still have an open line

1234
00:46:18,080 --> 00:46:20,120
of communication that's where a lot of

1235
00:46:20,120 --> 00:46:21,890
the big nasties can actually swim in and

1236
00:46:21,890 --> 00:46:25,040
bite you so as a developer it is an

1237
00:46:25,040 --> 00:46:27,140
important question to say hey we're

1238
00:46:27,140 --> 00:46:29,390
switching to framework X we're switching

1239
00:46:29,390 --> 00:46:32,600
to this architecture let's make sure

1240
00:46:32,600 --> 00:46:34,850
that somebody and it may not be the

1241
00:46:34,850 --> 00:46:37,430
autonomous team of Awesome buzzword e

1242
00:46:37,430 --> 00:46:39,380
let's make sure that they make the

1243
00:46:39,380 --> 00:46:40,970
nollet like you know the informed

1244
00:46:40,970 --> 00:46:42,590
decision that hey we're not gonna take

1245
00:46:42,590 --> 00:46:44,980
that other system offline because I

1246
00:46:44,980 --> 00:46:47,150
can't even think of a good reason so I'm

1247
00:46:47,150 --> 00:46:50,360
not even gonna try but make sure that

1248
00:46:50,360 --> 00:46:52,310
that knowledge doesn't live in that

1249
00:46:52,310 --> 00:46:54,680
autonomous team by itself if you want to

1250
00:46:54,680 --> 00:46:56,630
have three CRM systems that serve no

1251
00:46:56,630 --> 00:46:58,850
purpose more power to you I have no idea

1252
00:46:58,850 --> 00:47:01,490
why but let's not make sure let's make

1253
00:47:01,490 --> 00:47:03,410
sure that that type of thinking and that

1254
00:47:03,410 --> 00:47:04,520
type of knowledge is something that

1255
00:47:04,520 --> 00:47:07,190
actually lives outside of just the one

1256
00:47:07,190 --> 00:47:10,250
bubble of the people that know because

1257
00:47:10,250 --> 00:47:11,540
that is the type of thing that keeps you

1258
00:47:11,540 --> 00:47:13,040
up three and three in the army that's

1259
00:47:13,040 --> 00:47:14,690
where burnout comes from and that's

1260
00:47:14,690 --> 00:47:16,190
where a lot of the security you know the

1261
00:47:16,190 --> 00:47:18,880
business doesn't care about security I

1262
00:47:18,880 --> 00:47:21,050
would argue that most of the time they

1263
00:47:21,050 --> 00:47:23,600
just don't know and a part of that

1264
00:47:23,600 --> 00:47:25,310
knowing is making sure that the work

1265
00:47:25,310 --> 00:47:27,320
that's already being done is actually

1266
00:47:27,320 --> 00:47:29,600
invisible so it's looking at how can I

1267
00:47:29,600 --> 00:47:30,740
make sure that the work that I'm doing

1268
00:47:30,740 --> 00:47:35,450
is communicated it's not fancy but it

1269
00:47:35,450 --> 00:47:36,770
means that you'll actually get minutes

1270
00:47:36,770 --> 00:47:40,070
to actually improve that's all I wanted

1271
00:47:40,070 --> 00:47:42,710
to say I've talked about a lot of

1272
00:47:42,710 --> 00:47:44,450
standards and a lot of them come from a

1273
00:47:44,450 --> 00:47:46,430
wasp and a lot of the ideas aren't my

1274
00:47:46,430 --> 00:47:49,350
own so if you look at

1275
00:47:49,350 --> 00:47:51,000
wast there are a lot of good people I

1276
00:47:51,000 --> 00:47:52,140
don't have the names but I'm going to

1277
00:47:52,140 --> 00:47:53,850
give them to you Sam so that you can put

1278
00:47:53,850 --> 00:47:55,350
them and so that they can get credit

1279
00:47:55,350 --> 00:47:57,840
because I like I said I've been

1280
00:47:57,840 --> 00:47:59,370
enormously privileged to work with a lot

1281
00:47:59,370 --> 00:48:00,780
of good people but I'm gonna put up a

1282
00:48:00,780 --> 00:48:02,040
lot of good links and I'll give them to

1283
00:48:02,040 --> 00:48:04,890
Sam so that people can get credit and so

1284
00:48:04,890 --> 00:48:06,660
you can kind of copy/paste and steal

1285
00:48:06,660 --> 00:48:09,870
with pride because a lot of its really

1286
00:48:09,870 --> 00:48:12,300
really good information you can always

1287
00:48:12,300 --> 00:48:13,230
write to me on Twitter if you have

1288
00:48:13,230 --> 00:48:15,300
questions I tend to answer I've also

1289
00:48:15,300 --> 00:48:16,980
told Sam that I think secure development

1290
00:48:16,980 --> 00:48:20,280
school and I am once again trying to

1291
00:48:20,280 --> 00:48:22,170
teach myself how to program so I'm

1292
00:48:22,170 --> 00:48:25,710
taking a go course this summer so you

1293
00:48:25,710 --> 00:48:27,300
know if you wanna learn security and

1294
00:48:27,300 --> 00:48:28,800
you're like a go developer that wants to

1295
00:48:28,800 --> 00:48:30,780
like just listen to me cry you may be

1296
00:48:30,780 --> 00:48:33,960
able to like you know okay anyway so if

1297
00:48:33,960 --> 00:48:35,430
anyone has any questions I will just sit

1298
00:48:35,430 --> 00:48:36,870
here and try and answer them to the best

1299
00:48:36,870 --> 00:48:39,690
of my ability perfect thank you so much

1300
00:48:39,690 --> 00:48:42,240
I am Simon and it looks like we've got a

1301
00:48:42,240 --> 00:48:45,300
lot of thank you very much as but no

1302
00:48:45,300 --> 00:48:46,830
other questions coming through so I

1303
00:48:46,830 --> 00:48:49,230
think that is a wrap and if something

1304
00:48:49,230 --> 00:48:51,290
pops in and then I can stop wrapping up

1305
00:48:51,290 --> 00:48:53,880
but thank you so so much I really

1306
00:48:53,880 --> 00:48:56,090
enjoyed that and we actually had

1307
00:48:56,090 --> 00:48:58,380

1308
00:48:58,380 --> 00:48:59,910

1309
00:48:59,910 --> 00:49:02,100
so you have then go back and and sort of

1310
00:49:02,100 --> 00:49:03,240

1311
00:49:03,240 --> 00:49:05,160

1312
00:49:05,160 --> 00:49:06,960

thanks to them and other than that I

1331
00:49:51,300 --> 00:49:52,260
