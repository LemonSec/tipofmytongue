1
00:00:02,689 --> 00:00:06,540
amazing hello everyone and welcome to

2
00:00:06,540 --> 00:00:10,110
lead my dev sake ops community was

3
00:00:10,110 --> 00:00:12,660

4
00:00:12,660 --> 00:00:14,009
it's your first time joining us welcome

5
00:00:14,009 --> 00:00:16,139

coming in 2020 and today we're joined by

7
00:00:19,560 --> 00:00:22,080
lira Intel and if you guess from all

8
00:00:22,080 --> 00:00:23,100
over the world I think about someone

9
00:00:23,100 --> 00:00:25,710
from literally Singapore Thailand

10
00:00:25,710 --> 00:00:28,710
Australia Ireland and Boston's we have

11
00:00:28,710 --> 00:00:30,210
covered every part of the globe I feel

12
00:00:30,210 --> 00:00:34,170
for this panel so definitely a lot of

13
00:00:34,170 --> 00:00:35,760
different perspectives but before we get

14
00:00:35,760 --> 00:00:37,350
started quickly once you choose myself

15
00:00:37,350 --> 00:00:39,930
so my name's Sam I am the community

16
00:00:39,930 --> 00:00:43,350
manager Karen why they say box the one

17
00:00:43,350 --> 00:00:44,370
that worked behind the scenes to make

18
00:00:44,370 --> 00:00:45,930
everything happen to be any questions

19
00:00:45,930 --> 00:00:47,820
concerns if you want to suggest topics

20
00:00:47,820 --> 00:00:49,050
be a speaker

21
00:00:49,050 --> 00:00:50,820
I'm the human you look for an hour

22
00:00:50,820 --> 00:00:53,430
select community and flex actually the

23
00:00:53,430 --> 00:00:54,899
best way to interact today so if you're

24
00:00:54,899 --> 00:00:56,670
not hard of the slack community if you

25
00:00:56,670 --> 00:00:59,280
jump onto my dipstick save opslaan IO

26
00:00:59,280 --> 00:01:02,010
and enjoy the slack you can actually

27
00:01:02,010 --> 00:01:03,840
post questions interact with the rest of

28
00:01:03,840 --> 00:01:06,270
our community almost like a meet up face

29
00:01:06,270 --> 00:01:08,930
to face but just globally on mine and

30
00:01:08,930 --> 00:01:11,250
social so jump into there if not

31
00:01:11,250 --> 00:01:13,080
obviously you can comment on the YouTube

32
00:01:13,080 --> 00:01:14,790
comments as well I'll be watching those

33
00:01:14,790 --> 00:01:17,220
if you have any questions populations

34
00:01:17,220 --> 00:01:18,479
into the panel and we'll get those

35
00:01:18,479 --> 00:01:21,630
answered for you the other thing to sort

36
00:01:21,630 --> 00:01:23,070
of just mention is if you are watching

37
00:01:23,070 --> 00:01:24,900
this little cog on the bottom right hand

38
00:01:24,900 --> 00:01:26,310
corner of the screen if you turn your is

39
00:01:26,310 --> 00:01:28,500
the resolution up to maximum it's the

40
00:01:28,500 --> 00:01:31,409
best way to do today and then other than

41
00:01:31,409 --> 00:01:33,479
that that's enough for me I think you're

42
00:01:33,479 --> 00:01:35,189
all waiting to get started so I'm gonna

43
00:01:35,189 --> 00:01:37,350
hand over to the router to introduce the

44
00:01:37,350 --> 00:01:40,439
panel and sort of get the questions

45
00:01:40,439 --> 00:01:43,079
answered so over to you and welcome well

46
00:01:43,079 --> 00:01:43,950
thank you so much

47
00:01:43,950 --> 00:01:46,950
so before we get started maybe I should

48
00:01:46,950 --> 00:01:49,259
I should start with a small disclaimer

49
00:01:49,259 --> 00:01:51,899
so first of all as Sam said we have

50
00:01:51,899 --> 00:01:53,909
people from different continents so this

51
00:01:53,909 --> 00:01:55,890
means that like for muhammad's and

52
00:01:55,890 --> 00:01:58,619
Stefan it is 2:00 and 3:00 a.m. so you

53
00:01:58,619 --> 00:02:02,219
know maybe think twice before you get

54
00:02:02,219 --> 00:02:05,460
those security advices for certain it's

55
00:02:05,460 --> 00:02:07,770
like it's like a 6 a.m. thing in the

56
00:02:07,770 --> 00:02:09,419
morning I know that I do not operate

57
00:02:09,419 --> 00:02:12,120
well in those hours so you know

58
00:02:12,120 --> 00:02:17,099
a small disclaimer but anyway yes I'll

59
00:02:17,099 --> 00:02:18,690
do a short introduction I'm going

60
00:02:18,690 --> 00:02:21,120
through like a roundtable of people and

61
00:02:21,120 --> 00:02:23,400
then everyone can just chime in but

62
00:02:23,400 --> 00:02:24,959
first off we have Stefan who is a

63
00:02:24,959 --> 00:02:27,659
professional wide hyper founder of

64
00:02:27,659 --> 00:02:29,519
guardrails it's a security platform that

65
00:02:29,519 --> 00:02:31,079
allows you I think they do some dev

66
00:02:31,079 --> 00:02:32,280
psych ops thing that will probably

67
00:02:32,280 --> 00:02:35,579
mention a bit today we have David David

68
00:02:35,579 --> 00:02:37,680
Gonzalez is a cops for petitioners

69
00:02:37,680 --> 00:02:40,579
working on many projects at uniform

70
00:02:40,579 --> 00:02:44,160
coming from Airlines stephanie is in

71
00:02:44,160 --> 00:02:46,519
Thailand right now so that's 2 a.m.

72
00:02:46,519 --> 00:02:49,549
Sara is joining us as a princess of

73
00:02:49,549 --> 00:02:52,980
Microsoft Azure security which is an

74
00:02:52,980 --> 00:02:58,319
amazing title I will dig into that 6

75
00:02:58,319 --> 00:03:00,690
a.m. right now Sara it's very brave of

76
00:03:00,690 --> 00:03:03,030
you yeah that's right about why you

77
00:03:03,030 --> 00:03:09,769
can't see my face Mohammed is joining us

78
00:03:09,769 --> 00:03:15,540
from was that Singapore 20 M yes it is 3

79
00:03:15,540 --> 00:03:17,250
a.m. hi everyone

80
00:03:17,250 --> 00:03:20,700
and a brave person so how many is doing

81
00:03:20,700 --> 00:03:22,650
practical there psych ops and thank you

82
00:03:22,650 --> 00:03:25,280
for joining us all in those weird hours

83
00:03:25,280 --> 00:03:27,510
as for myself I'm a developer look at

84
00:03:27,510 --> 00:03:28,620
that sneak and doing a lot of stuff

85
00:03:28,620 --> 00:03:33,150
around no it's very security so I wanted

86
00:03:33,150 --> 00:03:35,129
you like I'll just kick it off I wanted

87
00:03:35,129 --> 00:03:38,040
to basically have this panel of experts

88
00:03:38,040 --> 00:03:39,900
around some practical dev sockets

89
00:03:39,900 --> 00:03:43,609
advices so we all kind of venture into

90
00:03:43,609 --> 00:03:46,379
into security into some extent in terms

91
00:03:46,379 --> 00:03:48,780
of like content videos within a pipeline

92
00:03:48,780 --> 00:03:50,340
sometimes it's security working groups

93
00:03:50,340 --> 00:03:54,090
for others here is of things like maybe

94
00:03:54,090 --> 00:03:55,889
education and training programs so I

95
00:03:55,889 --> 00:03:57,329
think it would be interesting to get

96
00:03:57,329 --> 00:03:59,639
like an advice and some tips to go and

97
00:03:59,639 --> 00:04:01,799
share with everyone else around this

98
00:04:01,799 --> 00:04:04,940
whole there psych ops kind of

99
00:04:04,940 --> 00:04:07,829
terminology that relates to all of this

100
00:04:07,829 --> 00:04:11,160
so if anyone wants to chime in with any

101
00:04:11,160 --> 00:04:14,069
weed any take from from your end that's

102
00:04:14,069 --> 00:04:15,690
amazing it's not I have some topics some

103
00:04:15,690 --> 00:04:19,548
how did you kind of run through

104
00:04:22,190 --> 00:04:26,250
yeah I will I will actually break the

105
00:04:26,250 --> 00:04:29,310
ice on that Juanita if you live I think

106
00:04:29,310 --> 00:04:32,010
I replied to feel your tweets recently

107
00:04:32,010 --> 00:04:35,130
and one of them was about people I think

108
00:04:35,130 --> 00:04:37,050
the people is the center they beginning

109
00:04:37,050 --> 00:04:38,880
at the end of every single security

110
00:04:38,880 --> 00:04:41,310
problem like many companies try to fix

111
00:04:41,310 --> 00:04:43,170
the security processes by basically

112
00:04:43,170 --> 00:04:44,940
adding more tools but if you don't fix

113
00:04:44,940 --> 00:04:46,710
the people the tools will make no effect

114
00:04:46,710 --> 00:04:49,080
whatsoever so that is my approach

115
00:04:49,080 --> 00:04:53,730
usually into security great its people

116
00:04:53,730 --> 00:04:55,860
and culture right and how do you those

117
00:04:55,860 --> 00:04:59,250
things at the end of the day so maybe

118
00:04:59,250 --> 00:05:01,770
let's jump into that with some so this

119
00:05:01,770 --> 00:05:03,630
week actually earlier this week so

120
00:05:03,630 --> 00:05:05,610
before flying over to Boston and I went

121
00:05:05,610 --> 00:05:09,170
to Austin which is a nice weather change

122
00:05:09,170 --> 00:05:12,410
and we had we had deaf psych upstairs

123
00:05:12,410 --> 00:05:14,730
which was really interesting dogs and I

124
00:05:14,730 --> 00:05:17,490
want to maybe jump into one of those and

125
00:05:17,490 --> 00:05:19,410
just some of these highlights that I

126
00:05:19,410 --> 00:05:21,870
captured from that session week I think

127
00:05:21,870 --> 00:05:25,560
it makes good talking material so one of

128
00:05:25,560 --> 00:05:29,220
those was Matt Lazaro he's been a truly

129
00:05:29,220 --> 00:05:31,080
active from the owhich community and

130
00:05:31,080 --> 00:05:33,030
security as well some people are

131
00:05:33,030 --> 00:05:36,420
familiar with him he had some kind of

132
00:05:36,420 --> 00:05:38,430
like God I think it was like a ten

133
00:05:38,430 --> 00:05:40,260
things I learned from experience doing

134
00:05:40,260 --> 00:05:42,450
that psych ops I think one of the first

135
00:05:42,450 --> 00:05:47,430
one items was like traditional security

136
00:05:47,430 --> 00:05:49,890
tooling which is I am paraphrasing it

137
00:05:49,890 --> 00:05:52,530
but it's mostly saying a few in eight

138
00:05:52,530 --> 00:05:52,890
hours

139
00:05:52,890 --> 00:05:55,620
thank you bye and throwing 500 pages

140
00:05:55,620 --> 00:05:58,110
PDFs over developers something security

141
00:05:58,110 --> 00:06:01,320
kind of capturing what is tradition apps

142
00:06:01,320 --> 00:06:03,690
like have been maybe for the last you

143
00:06:03,690 --> 00:06:06,200
know a decade or two

144
00:06:06,200 --> 00:06:08,700
so whatever what are your thoughts

145
00:06:08,700 --> 00:06:14,340
around that one oh I would love to start

146
00:06:14,340 --> 00:06:18,470
on this one specifically yeah I think

147
00:06:18,470 --> 00:06:20,700
that's that's one of the things that

148
00:06:20,700 --> 00:06:24,000
I've also seen in my career being a big

149
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:27,200
issue right because ultimately

150
00:06:27,200 --> 00:06:30,090
towards the text for security issues are

151
00:06:30,090 --> 00:06:33,960
very important but traditionally was

152
00:06:33,960 --> 00:06:35,249
always more important

153
00:06:35,249 --> 00:06:37,529
to find everything that's possibly wrong

154
00:06:37,529 --> 00:06:40,349
with with the cold or with an

155
00:06:40,349 --> 00:06:44,219
application and the hips of all that

156
00:06:44,219 --> 00:06:46,049
noise is typically taken by developers

157
00:06:46,049 --> 00:06:49,109
so like you say it takes 8 hours to get

158
00:06:49,109 --> 00:06:51,359
the results and then you have 500 pages

159
00:06:51,359 --> 00:06:54,179
of PDF reports that's actually a big

160
00:06:54,179 --> 00:06:56,909
issue right because nobody has time to

161
00:06:56,909 --> 00:06:59,849
actually look through that and it's just

162
00:06:59,849 --> 00:07:01,709
becoming noise at that stage and all of

163
00:07:01,709 --> 00:07:03,509
you have ever had a tool in in the

164
00:07:03,509 --> 00:07:05,269
pipeline that generates a lot of noise

165
00:07:05,269 --> 00:07:08,219
it's really something you just start

166
00:07:08,219 --> 00:07:10,860
ignoring and maybe the tool will still

167
00:07:10,860 --> 00:07:12,269
be in the pipeline for compliance

168
00:07:12,269 --> 00:07:15,119
reasons but nobody actually takes any

169
00:07:15,119 --> 00:07:18,419
action so I think it's now it's an

170
00:07:18,419 --> 00:07:20,159
interesting time of the next generation

171
00:07:20,159 --> 00:07:24,149
of security tools that actually focus on

172
00:07:24,149 --> 00:07:28,110
removing this huge amount of noise from

173
00:07:28,110 --> 00:07:30,360
developers and providing very much

174
00:07:30,360 --> 00:07:33,419
curated rule sets and curated results

175
00:07:33,419 --> 00:07:35,309
with a high level of accuracy to

176
00:07:35,309 --> 00:07:38,729
developers at the right time ideally in

177
00:07:38,729 --> 00:07:45,269
real time yeah I agree with you Stefan I

178
00:07:45,269 --> 00:07:48,169
think also the tools that we use like

179
00:07:48,169 --> 00:07:50,249
traditional security tools they do not

180
00:07:50,249 --> 00:07:53,099
work on modern environments like and the

181
00:07:53,099 --> 00:07:54,329
other day I was talking to a colleague

182
00:07:54,329 --> 00:07:57,239
and I had a very good example like what

183
00:07:57,239 --> 00:07:58,739
my opinion a very good example that

184
00:07:58,739 --> 00:08:01,979
someone has nice to say so basically and

185
00:08:01,979 --> 00:08:03,929
when you go to the doctor when you go to

186
00:08:03,929 --> 00:08:06,179
get some surgery what happens is the

187
00:08:06,179 --> 00:08:08,069
surgeon has all the information that he

188
00:08:08,069 --> 00:08:09,569
needs about you he has all the tools

189
00:08:09,569 --> 00:08:11,939
that he needs about you so you cannot

190
00:08:11,939 --> 00:08:13,649
imagine anyone going to a surgeon which

191
00:08:13,649 --> 00:08:14,999
is going to perform surgery and you say

192
00:08:14,999 --> 00:08:16,379
no sorry you cannot use this because

193
00:08:16,379 --> 00:08:18,119
it's I don't I don't trust you with this

194
00:08:18,119 --> 00:08:20,579
at hand you kind of know my medical

195
00:08:20,579 --> 00:08:22,259
records because sorry that's private

196
00:08:22,259 --> 00:08:24,360
information so why do we do that with

197
00:08:24,360 --> 00:08:26,969
engineers why instead of just kind of

198
00:08:26,969 --> 00:08:29,279
fitting a wall between the engineering

199
00:08:29,279 --> 00:08:31,739
and the systems why don't we just make

200
00:08:31,739 --> 00:08:33,179
them accountable for the system the same

201
00:08:33,179 --> 00:08:35,938
way that we exorcise Devils we exist we

202
00:08:35,938 --> 00:08:37,558
should exercise deficit hawks by making

203
00:08:37,558 --> 00:08:39,509
everyone on the team accountable for the

204
00:08:39,509 --> 00:08:43,188
security I'm responsible for it so

205
00:08:44,120 --> 00:08:46,260
that's a good take I'm gonna I'm gonna

206
00:08:46,260 --> 00:08:49,980
spin it around to see a different

207
00:08:49,980 --> 00:08:52,260
perspective and that is one thing I hear

208
00:08:52,260 --> 00:08:54,960
a lot of tweets though the whole notion

209
00:08:54,960 --> 00:08:57,360
of kind of like security is everyone's

210
00:08:57,360 --> 00:09:00,630
responsibility is what I'm hearing is

211
00:09:00,630 --> 00:09:02,430
like an argument with a car like a

212
00:09:02,430 --> 00:09:04,890
counter against it would be if it's

213
00:09:04,890 --> 00:09:07,220
everyone security then who's taking

214
00:09:07,220 --> 00:09:09,330
action on it because then you know

215
00:09:09,330 --> 00:09:11,460
everyone kind of expects someone else to

216
00:09:11,460 --> 00:09:13,470
do it so when you trust some something

217
00:09:13,470 --> 00:09:15,780
around like did you get that but the

218
00:09:15,780 --> 00:09:17,460
places that you've been working on with

219
00:09:17,460 --> 00:09:20,360
with no joining security tooling

220
00:09:20,360 --> 00:09:24,750
well I I think the problem is you see

221
00:09:24,750 --> 00:09:27,030
I'm a consultant so I only I'm only for

222
00:09:27,030 --> 00:09:28,680
a few months in a project so I don't see

223
00:09:28,680 --> 00:09:30,750
the evolution but I can give you another

224
00:09:30,750 --> 00:09:32,550
good example of that so I'm actually a

225
00:09:32,550 --> 00:09:34,590
part-time lecturer in college DC City

226
00:09:34,590 --> 00:09:37,170
College here in Dublin and one very good

227
00:09:37,170 --> 00:09:39,480
exercise I do with my my students is how

228
00:09:39,480 --> 00:09:40,500
would you store a password of the

229
00:09:40,500 --> 00:09:43,110
database and then they tell me yeah you

230
00:09:43,110 --> 00:09:45,660
store it in a table and then you laugh

231
00:09:45,660 --> 00:09:47,670
and then I tell them you know just throw

232
00:09:47,670 --> 00:09:48,870
it in a table and you leave the table

233
00:09:48,870 --> 00:09:51,960
you are going to means like millions of

234
00:09:51,960 --> 00:09:53,820
users like are gonna be leaked on the

235
00:09:53,820 --> 00:09:56,010
internet then I explain them all you

236
00:09:56,010 --> 00:09:57,510
could use a hash and then the earlier

237
00:09:57,510 --> 00:09:58,740
you get that's the best possible

238
00:09:58,740 --> 00:10:00,390
solution and it's like well you know if

239
00:10:00,390 --> 00:10:01,560
you have a hash you still can do a

240
00:10:01,560 --> 00:10:03,540
rainbow table attack and then you have a

241
00:10:03,540 --> 00:10:05,790
problem and then they are like well how

242
00:10:05,790 --> 00:10:06,750
do we solve that problem and then

243
00:10:06,750 --> 00:10:08,670
explain them to sell and then after that

244
00:10:08,670 --> 00:10:10,200
you can see when they are submitting

245
00:10:10,200 --> 00:10:11,280
their the continuous assessment

246
00:10:11,280 --> 00:10:12,570
practices like you know the typical

247
00:10:12,570 --> 00:10:14,910
project on college which everybody hates

248
00:10:14,910 --> 00:10:16,740
but everybody has to do and you can see

249
00:10:16,740 --> 00:10:18,810
how they had used these without telling

250
00:10:18,810 --> 00:10:20,370
them without being on the requirements

251
00:10:20,370 --> 00:10:22,650
like you don't have a requirement to

252
00:10:22,650 --> 00:10:24,870
sell your passwords because it's only a

253
00:10:24,870 --> 00:10:26,610
short span of time but they do it

254
00:10:26,610 --> 00:10:29,040
because they understand it so I think if

255
00:10:29,040 --> 00:10:30,690
people understand security instead of

256
00:10:30,690 --> 00:10:32,160
being the black box on the corner which

257
00:10:32,160 --> 00:10:34,350
is hindering them they will start using

258
00:10:34,350 --> 00:10:37,710
it and kind of like you know enforcing

259
00:10:37,710 --> 00:10:39,950
security of the process and the tools so

260
00:10:39,950 --> 00:10:43,260
it's the most dangerous thing that I can

261
00:10:43,260 --> 00:10:45,120
come off with it's a security process

262
00:10:45,120 --> 00:10:46,680
which does not understand the full flow

263
00:10:46,680 --> 00:10:49,020
and goes against developers because they

264
00:10:49,020 --> 00:10:50,520
will find their way around and you will

265
00:10:50,520 --> 00:10:53,460
be exposed hmm

266
00:10:53,460 --> 00:10:55,740
I'm just like it's tied in that

267
00:10:55,740 --> 00:10:59,010
I agree I think in the past we're very

268
00:10:59,010 --> 00:11:01,380
much focused on saying oh well we're

269
00:11:01,380 --> 00:11:03,030
security and you must do it this way

270
00:11:03,030 --> 00:11:05,790
even even if it's even if it's difficult

271
00:11:05,790 --> 00:11:08,670
and it hinders your job you need to do

272
00:11:08,670 --> 00:11:10,080
it this way because it's very important

273
00:11:10,080 --> 00:11:14,010
but in fact and as you said people

274
00:11:14,010 --> 00:11:15,660
people will always find a way around

275
00:11:15,660 --> 00:11:16,560
that

276
00:11:16,560 --> 00:11:19,260
they always do so you know we really

277
00:11:19,260 --> 00:11:22,290
need to make security transparent if we

278
00:11:22,290 --> 00:11:24,660
can but at least very very easy it needs

279
00:11:24,660 --> 00:11:27,510
to be the default easy way to do things

280
00:11:27,510 --> 00:11:30,930
otherwise people won't do it yeah the

281
00:11:30,930 --> 00:11:33,720
path of these resistance that's it yeah

282
00:11:33,720 --> 00:11:36,270
I think another interesting aspect would

283
00:11:36,270 --> 00:11:39,780
be if you look at focus from an AWS

284
00:11:39,780 --> 00:11:42,570
Amazon right he says you build it you

285
00:11:42,570 --> 00:11:46,410
run it and it was true because you can't

286
00:11:46,410 --> 00:11:48,240
actually you know give the

287
00:11:48,240 --> 00:11:49,950
responsibility and accountability to the

288
00:11:49,950 --> 00:11:51,630
other people in our departments it has

289
00:11:51,630 --> 00:11:53,700
to be with that team and there's another

290
00:11:53,700 --> 00:11:55,710
famous saying now that's being that's

291
00:11:55,710 --> 00:11:58,140
been coming up from John Willis you

292
00:11:58,140 --> 00:12:00,660
build it you secure it and I think this

293
00:12:00,660 --> 00:12:03,240
is also going in hand-in-hand with this

294
00:12:03,240 --> 00:12:05,520
it has to be owned by the team because

295
00:12:05,520 --> 00:12:08,370
nobody else knows the details of the

296
00:12:08,370 --> 00:12:10,950
application as much as the team and they

297
00:12:10,950 --> 00:12:12,630
have to be empowered to be in charge of

298
00:12:12,630 --> 00:12:16,160
making sure that they also secure it

299
00:12:16,220 --> 00:12:19,620
yeah that's very interesting you know

300
00:12:19,620 --> 00:12:22,710
proposal on on its own let's think about

301
00:12:22,710 --> 00:12:25,230
it we have been hearing security is

302
00:12:25,230 --> 00:12:27,840
everyone's responsibility from quite a

303
00:12:27,840 --> 00:12:28,650
while all right

304
00:12:28,650 --> 00:12:30,990
we have been saying this for maybe 10

305
00:12:30,990 --> 00:12:33,990
years now but then I would like to think

306
00:12:33,990 --> 00:12:35,730
about it like what could be the reasons

307
00:12:35,730 --> 00:12:38,780
that's not ingrained yet in the

308
00:12:38,780 --> 00:12:43,980
company's DNA how do you put that as a

309
00:12:43,980 --> 00:12:47,010
culture for everyone to be worried about

310
00:12:47,010 --> 00:12:50,010
it or at least where its implications

311
00:12:50,010 --> 00:12:55,980
and impact I guess yeah I I think and

312
00:12:55,980 --> 00:12:58,260
don't kill me for this Security's boring

313
00:12:58,260 --> 00:13:00,300
like if you need to write all the

314
00:13:00,300 --> 00:13:01,590
regular expressions for the input

315
00:13:01,590 --> 00:13:03,480
validation you need to make sure that

316
00:13:03,480 --> 00:13:05,400
there is no output encodings incorrectly

317
00:13:05,400 --> 00:13:07,770
you need to make sure that that is very

318
00:13:07,770 --> 00:13:08,910
tedious and people is

319
00:13:08,910 --> 00:13:10,950
yeah that's not super glamorous so I

320
00:13:10,950 --> 00:13:13,110
prefer to gasping the rest API in 25

321
00:13:13,110 --> 00:13:15,150
minutes and make sure that it's

322
00:13:15,150 --> 00:13:16,740
delivering value to the business

323
00:13:16,740 --> 00:13:20,340
it's not seeing as somebody or as a

324
00:13:20,340 --> 00:13:23,640
neighbor of other tools like in reality

325
00:13:23,640 --> 00:13:26,040
security is it's a price to pay to be

326
00:13:26,040 --> 00:13:28,290
there but usually it's not something

327
00:13:28,290 --> 00:13:30,150
that will deliver value of us to a city

328
00:13:30,150 --> 00:13:32,190
or whether you prefer the label a new

329
00:13:32,190 --> 00:13:34,680
feature which is gonna bring back like X

330
00:13:34,680 --> 00:13:37,230
amount of money every month or make make

331
00:13:37,230 --> 00:13:39,330
safer what is at the moment running in

332
00:13:39,330 --> 00:13:40,950
production I can tell you the odds were

333
00:13:40,950 --> 00:13:43,100
99 percent of the time

334
00:13:43,100 --> 00:13:47,700
so yes I'm gonna jump on that and I'll

335
00:13:47,700 --> 00:13:49,350
take it - maybe - and another takeaway

336
00:13:49,350 --> 00:13:51,330
that was from Matt's talk and that was

337
00:13:51,330 --> 00:13:53,190
and I think it's kind of release work

338
00:13:53,190 --> 00:13:55,770
we're saying here that is so one of

339
00:13:55,770 --> 00:13:57,750
those actual key takeaways were drive

340
00:13:57,750 --> 00:14:01,140
down complexity which is make it easier

341
00:14:01,140 --> 00:14:02,940
to secure fans and I think if if you

342
00:14:02,940 --> 00:14:05,190
look at it yes from a developer

343
00:14:05,190 --> 00:14:08,010
perspective so it's enabling two-factor

344
00:14:08,010 --> 00:14:09,450
authentication it's like really really a

345
00:14:09,450 --> 00:14:10,800
simple thing for you you know you

346
00:14:10,800 --> 00:14:13,710
probably want to do it if you know

347
00:14:13,710 --> 00:14:15,570
integrating some tool or you know

348
00:14:15,570 --> 00:14:17,970
running through some process to make

349
00:14:17,970 --> 00:14:19,770
sure that your app is secure that and

350
00:14:19,770 --> 00:14:23,100
it's like easy and do not add complexity

351
00:14:23,100 --> 00:14:24,720
to do that either from like an end-user

352
00:14:24,720 --> 00:14:26,040
perspective or from the developer

353
00:14:26,040 --> 00:14:28,410
perspective then people are gonna adopt

354
00:14:28,410 --> 00:14:30,360
that it's it's it's much easier to do it

355
00:14:30,360 --> 00:14:31,830
and I've been having some talks about

356
00:14:31,830 --> 00:14:34,410
that which with Omer Omer

357
00:14:34,410 --> 00:14:36,480
levena Browning is from saludo he's also

358
00:14:36,480 --> 00:14:38,280
doing a lot of def psych ops

359
00:14:38,280 --> 00:14:41,700
kind of things absoluto it's been kind

360
00:14:41,700 --> 00:14:44,580
of like a repeating theme for us when

361
00:14:44,580 --> 00:14:45,660
you're talking about

362
00:14:45,660 --> 00:14:47,820
security like how do we make it more

363
00:14:47,820 --> 00:14:50,880
accessible for Dells and users once was

364
00:14:50,880 --> 00:14:53,570
accessible once it's easier to grab

365
00:14:53,570 --> 00:14:55,860
people we'll just we'll just follow it

366
00:14:55,860 --> 00:14:59,460
there's an obvious ROI in terms of you

367
00:14:59,460 --> 00:15:00,540
know the reach that you will mitigate

368
00:15:00,540 --> 00:15:03,030
and if it's just easy to do it why would

369
00:15:03,030 --> 00:15:06,690
you not do it Danny gentle yeah I can

370
00:15:06,690 --> 00:15:08,160
give you a very good example on that for

371
00:15:08,160 --> 00:15:10,110
example AWS everybody more or less have

372
00:15:10,110 --> 00:15:12,330
what we take the bluest right so then

373
00:15:12,330 --> 00:15:14,160
you have the rate of us credentials that

374
00:15:14,160 --> 00:15:16,230
to me is the ring-fenced so anything we

375
00:15:16,230 --> 00:15:18,000
can access with AWS credentials it's a

376
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:19,800
security risk so you make sure that the

377
00:15:19,800 --> 00:15:22,230
I body we're protected but then we

378
00:15:22,230 --> 00:15:25,110
have companies like you know having VPNs

379
00:15:25,110 --> 00:15:27,510
we have SSL between services in the

380
00:15:27,510 --> 00:15:30,420
communities cluster we have like super

381
00:15:30,420 --> 00:15:32,160
world policies on what you can create

382
00:15:32,160 --> 00:15:35,250
that what you cannot create but nobody

383
00:15:35,250 --> 00:15:36,450
has training on how to protect these

384
00:15:36,450 --> 00:15:37,980
credentials and you can't see them on

385
00:15:37,980 --> 00:15:39,690
the on the machines of the engineers and

386
00:15:39,690 --> 00:15:40,950
you can't see them like you know

387
00:15:40,950 --> 00:15:43,140
sometimes accidentally and get comments

388
00:15:43,140 --> 00:15:45,120
and he's like well you know that is a

389
00:15:45,120 --> 00:15:48,180
very low hanging fruit in there and that

390
00:15:48,180 --> 00:15:50,160
it's easy to fix but you are focusing

391
00:15:50,160 --> 00:15:51,840
much more complex things which probably

392
00:15:51,840 --> 00:15:54,540
are not gonna be ever an attack vector

393
00:15:54,540 --> 00:15:57,480
like security itself I think it follows

394
00:15:57,480 --> 00:15:59,610
the rule of 8020 like 80% of the work

395
00:15:59,610 --> 00:16:01,320
will tell you 20% of the time which is

396
00:16:01,320 --> 00:16:03,420
the basics what you mention in an item

397
00:16:03,420 --> 00:16:05,880
and then the other 20% is gonna cheer

398
00:16:05,880 --> 00:16:08,130
away 80% of your time and that's where

399
00:16:08,130 --> 00:16:09,750
you really have a lot of value in there

400
00:16:09,750 --> 00:16:11,880
you there is no such thing as perfect

401
00:16:11,880 --> 00:16:14,190
security there is reasonable security

402
00:16:14,190 --> 00:16:17,490
always like depend on only one thing and

403
00:16:17,490 --> 00:16:19,440
actually we'd like to add an interesting

404
00:16:19,440 --> 00:16:21,410
quote you know you've all heard about

405
00:16:21,410 --> 00:16:23,700
perfection is not if there's nothing

406
00:16:23,700 --> 00:16:25,200
left to be add but if there's nothing

407
00:16:25,200 --> 00:16:27,330
left to be taken away and I actually

408
00:16:27,330 --> 00:16:29,760
think you should apply for security and

409
00:16:29,760 --> 00:16:32,040
this goes also back to initial question

410
00:16:32,040 --> 00:16:34,620
on the 500 pages of PDF reports right

411
00:16:34,620 --> 00:16:38,660
because that's not that's not the the

412
00:16:38,660 --> 00:16:41,250
nothing that can be left that can be

413
00:16:41,250 --> 00:16:43,380
taken away that's really everything that

414
00:16:43,380 --> 00:16:44,760
could have been added to it which is

415
00:16:44,760 --> 00:16:48,050
causing all of the problems we have yeah

416
00:16:48,050 --> 00:16:50,000
interesting perspective in their name

417
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:52,980
yeah I would also like to think it when

418
00:16:52,980 --> 00:16:55,410
it comes to culture is about a law

419
00:16:55,410 --> 00:16:58,800
called Congress law states that need

420
00:16:58,800 --> 00:17:01,530
your organization if you are designing a

421
00:17:01,530 --> 00:17:03,600
system it will produce a design which is

422
00:17:03,600 --> 00:17:05,040
similar to your communication software

423
00:17:05,040 --> 00:17:08,790
or organization usually if you see you

424
00:17:08,790 --> 00:17:12,150
know the companies are the communication

425
00:17:12,150 --> 00:17:13,619
structure defines how you design a

426
00:17:13,619 --> 00:17:15,750
system I mean companies who are pretty

427
00:17:15,750 --> 00:17:18,540
flat in nature the the systems design

428
00:17:18,540 --> 00:17:21,690
are usually pretty fast innovative and

429
00:17:21,690 --> 00:17:25,380
less of when I had lot of bottlenecks to

430
00:17:25,380 --> 00:17:27,510
it so they're pretty nimble agile and

431
00:17:27,510 --> 00:17:33,080
lean as we say right so yeah

432
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:37,010
yeah no no that makes perfect sense and

433
00:17:37,010 --> 00:17:38,419
that that applies as well to to the sign

434
00:17:38,419 --> 00:17:40,519
of the systems the Conway's law is kind

435
00:17:40,519 --> 00:17:42,470
of like you can see that everywhere you

436
00:17:42,470 --> 00:17:44,659
stop seeing it when you are inside but

437
00:17:44,659 --> 00:17:46,639
once you come fresh into a project and

438
00:17:46,639 --> 00:17:48,409
you just get all the information

439
00:17:48,409 --> 00:17:50,630
together is like why it stays like that

440
00:17:50,630 --> 00:17:52,460
and then you see the structure of the

441
00:17:52,460 --> 00:17:53,840
companion is like oh wait that makes

442
00:17:53,840 --> 00:17:55,909
perfect sense so yeah it's a very funny

443
00:17:55,909 --> 00:17:57,610
one

444
00:17:57,610 --> 00:18:01,789
yeah it comes to security we do have a

445
00:18:01,789 --> 00:18:03,500
lot of layers you know look at the

446
00:18:03,500 --> 00:18:05,480
traditional security and see process you

447
00:18:05,480 --> 00:18:08,720
have at least 17 gates in it and yeah we

448
00:18:08,720 --> 00:18:11,710
have we have names as kids you know and

449
00:18:11,710 --> 00:18:13,940
that bob says hey you should not have

450
00:18:13,940 --> 00:18:16,970
any gates it should be you know as stiff

451
00:18:16,970 --> 00:18:19,580
and say Scott Leitz I have a good take

452
00:18:19,580 --> 00:18:24,620
on that I'm gonna pick your brains in

453
00:18:24,620 --> 00:18:28,490
this as well so cat's wits would

454
00:18:28,490 --> 00:18:30,230
actually at that conference earlier this

455
00:18:30,230 --> 00:18:34,820
week and she had is amazing slide she

456
00:18:34,820 --> 00:18:36,889
was saying security is seen as the

457
00:18:36,889 --> 00:18:39,740
Department of no well their box is seen

458
00:18:39,740 --> 00:18:53,090
as a department of Yolo but if that's

459
00:18:53,090 --> 00:18:55,039
the case then you know what what would

460
00:18:55,039 --> 00:18:57,649
be seen as the Department of Dance I

461
00:18:57,649 --> 00:19:02,200
cops of those that bridge you know yeah

462
00:19:02,200 --> 00:19:05,330
if I can't time in which as you know by

463
00:19:05,330 --> 00:19:08,630
now I talk a lot and that's in my DNA so

464
00:19:08,630 --> 00:19:10,220
there is no such thing as the box or

465
00:19:10,220 --> 00:19:11,720
there is no such thing as that there is

466
00:19:11,720 --> 00:19:14,059
deficit cops from nothing like when you

467
00:19:14,059 --> 00:19:15,590
are building your de box structures on

468
00:19:15,590 --> 00:19:17,120
your infrastructure or your company

469
00:19:17,120 --> 00:19:19,970
itself like you really need to think on

470
00:19:19,970 --> 00:19:21,500
the security and has to be a first-class

471
00:19:21,500 --> 00:19:24,710
citizen like my colleague Alex null

472
00:19:24,710 --> 00:19:27,260
which you probably know as well like we

473
00:19:27,260 --> 00:19:28,669
are good friends and also we work

474
00:19:28,669 --> 00:19:30,740
together he always says the same phrase

475
00:19:30,740 --> 00:19:34,700
like we like deficit cops are to

476
00:19:34,700 --> 00:19:36,440
technology what management consultants

477
00:19:36,440 --> 00:19:38,210
are to business so you need to make sure

478
00:19:38,210 --> 00:19:41,629
that everything is together is super

479
00:19:41,629 --> 00:19:43,370
hard to retrofit the security back into

480
00:19:43,370 --> 00:19:45,409
our own system like it really really

481
00:19:45,409 --> 00:19:46,670
doesn't pay

482
00:19:46,670 --> 00:19:50,630
I mean it's not impossible but it has to

483
00:19:50,630 --> 00:19:53,180
pay dividends really good to avoid doing

484
00:19:53,180 --> 00:19:54,170
that from the beginning because

485
00:19:54,170 --> 00:19:56,420
otherwise and you know the amount of

486
00:19:56,420 --> 00:19:57,560
work and the amount of lease you are

487
00:19:57,560 --> 00:20:06,410
supposed to list is enormous so so we

488
00:20:06,410 --> 00:20:08,090
have a princess on the line I'm

489
00:20:08,090 --> 00:20:12,440
wondering what she thinks about security

490
00:20:12,440 --> 00:20:17,660
in the pipeline yeah I think everyone

491
00:20:17,660 --> 00:20:19,730
covered most of the stuff there to be

492
00:20:19,730 --> 00:20:22,550
honest that's why we staying quiet I

493
00:20:22,550 --> 00:20:25,400
think if you're doing the pipeline's

494
00:20:25,400 --> 00:20:28,550
difficult one though because it depends

495
00:20:28,550 --> 00:20:29,690
what you want to push through your

496
00:20:29,690 --> 00:20:33,890
pipeline to be on it and and that's why

497
00:20:33,890 --> 00:20:34,970
I think it's one of these things that's

498
00:20:34,970 --> 00:20:37,120
very contextual which is like difficult

499
00:20:37,120 --> 00:20:39,680
I think there's always some principles

500
00:20:39,680 --> 00:20:43,490
you can follow on it but it it it does

501
00:20:43,490 --> 00:20:45,050
depend essentially what you're planning

502
00:20:45,050 --> 00:20:46,880
to deploy which is why I don't think we

503
00:20:46,880 --> 00:20:48,890
can say you know you need X and you need

504
00:20:48,890 --> 00:20:51,110
X and you need X and then you'll be fine

505
00:20:51,110 --> 00:20:52,400
and actually be able to cover lots of

506
00:20:52,400 --> 00:20:55,940
people which is why and topics it is

507
00:20:55,940 --> 00:21:01,240
tricky I would say cause I think oh

508
00:21:01,240 --> 00:21:03,200
sorry what someone gonna say something

509
00:21:03,200 --> 00:21:09,200
no no and yeah so I I'm just yeah like

510
00:21:09,200 --> 00:21:11,810
of course you need it but and also the

511
00:21:11,810 --> 00:21:13,190
other thing with pipeline is you could

512
00:21:13,190 --> 00:21:16,130
of course like you can layer upon layer

513
00:21:16,130 --> 00:21:18,440
upon layer upon layer of security checks

514
00:21:18,440 --> 00:21:21,500
and control in in a pipeline so it's how

515
00:21:21,500 --> 00:21:24,890
far do you go with that I mean I can it

516
00:21:24,890 --> 00:21:27,680
you know you can you can go crazy to the

517
00:21:27,680 --> 00:21:29,540
nth degree as well if you really want to

518
00:21:29,540 --> 00:21:31,660
but you know balancing that with

519
00:21:31,660 --> 00:21:34,100
functionality and cost can be tricky

520
00:21:34,100 --> 00:21:37,640
so yeah how far do you take it practical

521
00:21:37,640 --> 00:21:40,610
as well yeah I'd say the security and

522
00:21:40,610 --> 00:21:42,140
the pipeline is the emergency parachute

523
00:21:42,140 --> 00:21:44,270
is what saves your life something goes

524
00:21:44,270 --> 00:21:46,520
wrong but your normal process your Romer

525
00:21:46,520 --> 00:21:48,260
Flajnik falling from the plane should we

526
00:21:48,260 --> 00:21:51,260
include the measures to stop columns so

527
00:21:51,260 --> 00:21:55,090
that's I think it's a good Somali under

528
00:21:55,090 --> 00:21:57,620
my planter is not after you deploy

529
00:21:57,620 --> 00:21:59,150
necessarily so

530
00:21:59,150 --> 00:22:02,000
it's used as an emergency or something

531
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:05,240
that is still somewhere there in the STL

532
00:22:05,240 --> 00:22:07,250
so kind of making sure you're not doing

533
00:22:07,250 --> 00:22:11,000
fuzzy things well yeah I think it's

534
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:13,450
sorry go ahead

535
00:22:13,450 --> 00:22:16,190
so I I just want to add you because I

536
00:22:16,190 --> 00:22:18,350
think the pipeline in order to

537
00:22:18,350 --> 00:22:19,880
understand the benefits of the pipe that

538
00:22:19,880 --> 00:22:21,410
we have to understand where tools are

539
00:22:21,410 --> 00:22:24,230
really good at and there's a famous

540
00:22:24,230 --> 00:22:27,110
quote saying we all like tools can

541
00:22:27,110 --> 00:22:29,150
identify if you put all the tools that

542
00:22:29,150 --> 00:22:30,860
exist out there the world right now you

543
00:22:30,860 --> 00:22:33,020
can identify 50% of the security

544
00:22:33,020 --> 00:22:35,300
vulnerabilities out there the other 50%

545
00:22:35,300 --> 00:22:38,390
have to be identified for humans so I

546
00:22:38,390 --> 00:22:40,820
think we're we're pipelines really good

547
00:22:40,820 --> 00:22:42,830
at and we're automation couldn't come in

548
00:22:42,830 --> 00:22:45,590
very handy is where some of these low

549
00:22:45,590 --> 00:22:47,660
hanging fruits can be automated away or

550
00:22:47,660 --> 00:22:49,280
can be very easily identified through

551
00:22:49,280 --> 00:22:52,040
this automation so that the humans can

552
00:22:52,040 --> 00:22:53,900
actually focus and more high impact

553
00:22:53,900 --> 00:22:56,540
issues that tools cannot identify a key

554
00:22:56,540 --> 00:22:59,570
stage and this is maybe something that

555
00:22:59,570 --> 00:23:01,820
in the next couple of years truly

556
00:23:01,820 --> 00:23:04,340
advanced of machine learning artificial

557
00:23:04,340 --> 00:23:07,040
intelligence this domain will become

558
00:23:07,040 --> 00:23:09,050
smaller and smaller for humans but

559
00:23:09,050 --> 00:23:10,429
that's great right because we want to

560
00:23:10,429 --> 00:23:13,160
focus on more high impact issues the

561
00:23:13,160 --> 00:23:15,410
tools cannot identify and so if the

562
00:23:15,410 --> 00:23:16,910
pipeline's can actually get rid of all

563
00:23:16,910 --> 00:23:18,980
of these other all of the other issues

564
00:23:18,980 --> 00:23:24,290
that we don't want to identify the 1001

565
00:23:24,290 --> 00:23:26,780
cross-site scripting for example then

566
00:23:26,780 --> 00:23:28,429
that's fantastic right because the we

567
00:23:28,429 --> 00:23:30,440
can focus on a more high issues and

568
00:23:30,440 --> 00:23:32,809
don't have to deal with these things

569
00:23:32,809 --> 00:23:34,550
that can be easily identified through

570
00:23:34,550 --> 00:23:50,210
automation so I'm not sure I haven't

571
00:23:50,210 --> 00:23:51,350
seen the 5210

572
00:23:51,350 --> 00:23:55,760
statistic myself but I think it is

573
00:23:55,760 --> 00:23:57,920
possible but again it depends on how

574
00:23:57,920 --> 00:23:59,240
you're set up and what tools you're

575
00:23:59,240 --> 00:24:01,340
using it is possible to get higher than

576
00:24:01,340 --> 00:24:04,580
50% but I absolutely agree that I don't

577
00:24:04,580 --> 00:24:06,440
know other would would caution using the

578
00:24:06,440 --> 00:24:08,570
word the domain is getting smaller I

579
00:24:08,570 --> 00:24:10,850
think more focused is that air because

580
00:24:10,850 --> 00:24:12,679
certainly we're always gonna have to

581
00:24:12,679 --> 00:24:13,010
have

582
00:24:13,010 --> 00:24:16,309
look at the more interesting or complex

583
00:24:16,309 --> 00:24:20,030
or new new threats or vulnerabilities

584
00:24:20,030 --> 00:24:23,630
but definitely definitely I think it if

585
00:24:23,630 --> 00:24:25,460
you're like looking for security

586
00:24:25,460 --> 00:24:27,140
vulnerabilities I think it's exciting

587
00:24:27,140 --> 00:24:28,760
because it means you'll get to work on

588
00:24:28,760 --> 00:24:30,980
actual different things and interesting

589
00:24:30,980 --> 00:24:32,780
things and automation takes the noise

590
00:24:32,780 --> 00:24:45,470
out hopefully sure so I would like to

591
00:24:45,470 --> 00:24:48,049
you know step back a bit and think about

592
00:24:48,049 --> 00:24:49,549
it from a different perspective as well

593
00:24:49,549 --> 00:24:52,370
you know no DevOps has this principles

594
00:24:52,370 --> 00:24:54,320
core principles call camps you know

595
00:24:54,320 --> 00:24:56,360
culture our mission measurement and

596
00:24:56,360 --> 00:24:59,510
sharing unfortunately we tend to keep on

597
00:24:59,510 --> 00:25:02,179
focusing more on automation side of

598
00:25:02,179 --> 00:25:04,309
thing without thinking about as Steven

599
00:25:04,309 --> 00:25:06,320
was mentioning their pros and cons and

600
00:25:06,320 --> 00:25:08,929
to be very honest and please don't quote

601
00:25:08,929 --> 00:25:12,440
me on it I personally think that 90% of

602
00:25:12,440 --> 00:25:14,360
the tool existing tooling in the market

603
00:25:14,360 --> 00:25:17,179
especially security actually is not fit

604
00:25:17,179 --> 00:25:19,580
for DevOps pipelines and and that's a

605
00:25:19,580 --> 00:25:22,460
sad reality like stiffen and I think

606
00:25:22,460 --> 00:25:25,160
Matt was saying about tools need eight

607
00:25:25,160 --> 00:25:26,510
hours to run and like do you think

608
00:25:26,510 --> 00:25:28,790
developers would be bending for you for

609
00:25:28,790 --> 00:25:31,610
eight hours to finish the pipeline but

610
00:25:31,610 --> 00:25:34,130
again that's a sad reality there's we

611
00:25:34,130 --> 00:25:35,980
have to as Tiffin was mentioning

612
00:25:35,980 --> 00:25:38,840
identify what tool fits into what

613
00:25:38,840 --> 00:25:41,419
process for example static analysis is

614
00:25:41,419 --> 00:25:44,210
pretty good to start with and if you can

615
00:25:44,210 --> 00:25:46,429
set it up your tools properly it can

616
00:25:46,429 --> 00:25:48,530
finish within maybe let's say fifteen

617
00:25:48,530 --> 00:25:51,559
ten to fifteen minutes and personally I

618
00:25:51,559 --> 00:25:54,260
have this criteria which I define called

619
00:25:54,260 --> 00:25:58,130
F succumbs gospel and as far that the

620
00:25:58,130 --> 00:26:01,429
criteria one say that your your bells

621
00:26:01,429 --> 00:26:03,890
are the security tooling should not take

622
00:26:03,890 --> 00:26:06,080
more than 15 minutes and again I'm being

623
00:26:06,080 --> 00:26:08,510
very gracious there by by giving it 15

624
00:26:08,510 --> 00:26:10,820
minutes is usually less than that maybe

625
00:26:10,820 --> 00:26:13,250
like 10 minutes would be very more than

626
00:26:13,250 --> 00:26:15,470
what you can you can expect in a

627
00:26:15,470 --> 00:26:18,200
pipeline so yeah so again as I mentioned

628
00:26:18,200 --> 00:26:21,230
like when I really talk about that's a

629
00:26:21,230 --> 00:26:23,720
cough speech people usually say okay are

630
00:26:23,720 --> 00:26:27,550
you talking about security tooling like

631
00:26:27,550 --> 00:26:31,610
just just 1/4 of the entire process you

632
00:26:31,610 --> 00:26:33,590
know the culture automation machine many

633
00:26:33,590 --> 00:26:36,410
sharing and I think we need to stop

634
00:26:36,410 --> 00:26:39,260
looking at that's a customer to leave

635
00:26:39,260 --> 00:26:42,320
perspective but also consider I'm sure

636
00:26:42,320 --> 00:26:44,000
we need tooling which we have been using

637
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:46,580
the condition for a long time but then

638
00:26:46,580 --> 00:26:49,340
we also should be looking at hey would

639
00:26:49,340 --> 00:26:51,680
it be fitting nicely in DeVos pipeline

640
00:26:51,680 --> 00:26:53,960
be thought blocking developers from

641
00:26:53,960 --> 00:27:00,050
innovating at the speed of DevOps I kind

642
00:27:00,050 --> 00:27:02,210
of I'm gonna be the one disagreeing here

643
00:27:02,210 --> 00:27:06,740
I think and I really think that in the

644
00:27:06,740 --> 00:27:08,570
next few years we are not gonna see

645
00:27:08,570 --> 00:27:10,400
automation of security but we are going

646
00:27:10,400 --> 00:27:12,650
to see tools that support humans to do

647
00:27:12,650 --> 00:27:15,770
the work more efficiently so I I think

648
00:27:15,770 --> 00:27:19,820
is too complex of a domain and to be

649
00:27:19,820 --> 00:27:21,770
able to just automate everything and at

650
00:27:21,770 --> 00:27:23,270
some point someone is gonna come back

651
00:27:23,270 --> 00:27:24,560
and say wait a second

652
00:27:24,560 --> 00:27:27,740
why don't we instead of how to making

653
00:27:27,740 --> 00:27:31,610
like everything and inundate like like

654
00:27:31,610 --> 00:27:34,130
fluid completely there's lab groups with

655
00:27:34,130 --> 00:27:36,320
false positives which nobody's gonna

656
00:27:36,320 --> 00:27:38,480
look at whether we just provide support

657
00:27:38,480 --> 00:27:40,460
like for example of my own my editor why

658
00:27:40,460 --> 00:27:41,750
don't I get just you know what is a

659
00:27:41,750 --> 00:27:44,030
security vulnerability or my cold what

660
00:27:44,030 --> 00:27:45,410
is a patent which is very similar that

661
00:27:45,410 --> 00:27:48,890
was code before in a cynical review sort

662
00:27:48,890 --> 00:27:51,710
of a you know this type of assistance in

663
00:27:51,710 --> 00:27:54,020
to developers and assistance in 29 years

664
00:27:54,020 --> 00:27:56,150
in general to be able to post security

665
00:27:56,150 --> 00:27:58,580
in to the left instead of waiting until

666
00:27:58,580 --> 00:27:59,960
the pipeline triggers to the prior to

667
00:27:59,960 --> 00:28:01,610
production which by the way it's already

668
00:28:01,610 --> 00:28:04,400
too late it tells me beforehand this

669
00:28:04,400 --> 00:28:06,740
might be a potential issue because

670
00:28:06,740 --> 00:28:09,020
whatever reason I think that's gonna be

671
00:28:09,020 --> 00:28:14,780
the next trend in my opinion yeah I'm

672
00:28:14,780 --> 00:28:17,420
gonna I'm gonna spin this off and choose

673
00:28:17,420 --> 00:28:20,120
if you don't have a lot of time into

674
00:28:20,120 --> 00:28:23,690
maybe a couple more thoughts on process

675
00:28:23,690 --> 00:28:26,120
tooling sort of process and culture and

676
00:28:26,120 --> 00:28:27,710
maybe let's talk about some tooling

677
00:28:27,710 --> 00:28:31,670
ideas from experience but I think I

678
00:28:31,670 --> 00:28:35,270
think both of those topics Mohammed

679
00:28:35,270 --> 00:28:36,980
[Music]

680
00:28:36,980 --> 00:28:39,860
and in babies were just kind of raising

681
00:28:39,860 --> 00:28:42,710
now is stacking out - I saw this

682
00:28:42,710 --> 00:28:44,090
question coming in on the live chat

683
00:28:44,090 --> 00:28:47,000
about tried modeling in agile projects

684
00:28:47,000 --> 00:28:49,760
and it kind of like also direct relation

685
00:28:49,760 --> 00:28:52,300
or take away from from a clock which was

686
00:28:52,300 --> 00:28:54,890
having like shared clear understanding

687
00:28:54,890 --> 00:28:57,050
on what you're building and this is

688
00:28:57,050 --> 00:28:58,400
again this is something that is I think

689
00:28:58,400 --> 00:29:00,620
ty is very directly in terms of what

690
00:29:00,620 --> 00:29:02,210
DevOps have always Big Mike's like

691
00:29:02,210 --> 00:29:04,250
taking devs and ops together so we

692
00:29:04,250 --> 00:29:06,590
understand what we need to build how to

693
00:29:06,590 --> 00:29:09,020
build it right how is the app supposed

694
00:29:09,020 --> 00:29:11,300
to work how should we know containerize

695
00:29:11,300 --> 00:29:14,240
in whatever we need to do there but it's

696
00:29:14,240 --> 00:29:16,340
also tying up into into security I think

697
00:29:16,340 --> 00:29:17,780
in some what - threat modeling because

698
00:29:17,780 --> 00:29:19,610
if you have assured clear understanding

699
00:29:19,610 --> 00:29:21,530
across a team you're bringing all the

700
00:29:21,530 --> 00:29:23,090
relevant stakeholders together so going

701
00:29:23,090 --> 00:29:25,640
to ops and security maybe at a point

702
00:29:25,640 --> 00:29:27,770
before building it or you know referral

703
00:29:27,770 --> 00:29:28,850
ease during building it and different

704
00:29:28,850 --> 00:29:31,280
not afterwards we can talk about you

705
00:29:31,280 --> 00:29:34,070
know properly understanding greeson's

706
00:29:34,070 --> 00:29:36,890
properly tried modeling it to be able to

707
00:29:36,890 --> 00:29:38,960
understand how to build it right from a

708
00:29:38,960 --> 00:29:41,240
security perspective as well and what we

709
00:29:41,240 --> 00:29:43,990
should be under what we really should be

710
00:29:43,990 --> 00:29:47,420
swimming on ourselves as well so did you

711
00:29:47,420 --> 00:29:52,280
have any minute irritation that I think

712
00:29:52,280 --> 00:29:53,900
it kind of aligns with what we've all

713
00:29:53,900 --> 00:29:55,760
been saying just wondering if anyone has

714
00:29:55,760 --> 00:29:58,640
any any personal experience and at the

715
00:29:58,640 --> 00:30:04,610
sheraton I like and again like that's

716
00:30:04,610 --> 00:30:08,510
only my experience agile is a very very

717
00:30:08,510 --> 00:30:11,390
interesting enemy of security like if

718
00:30:11,390 --> 00:30:13,190
you see all the sprints and all the

719
00:30:13,190 --> 00:30:15,080
planning on all the story pointing and

720
00:30:15,080 --> 00:30:17,120
all the processes are wrong it's all

721
00:30:17,120 --> 00:30:19,610
about the Librium value so some people

722
00:30:19,610 --> 00:30:21,740
will be like what is the value of this

723
00:30:21,740 --> 00:30:24,740
story which you know might be fixing one

724
00:30:24,740 --> 00:30:26,630
of the security issues of my application

725
00:30:26,630 --> 00:30:28,640
but we never had something before what

726
00:30:28,640 --> 00:30:30,200
what value is that bring it so you need

727
00:30:30,200 --> 00:30:32,540
to be very sharp to explain that to

728
00:30:32,540 --> 00:30:34,400
stakeholders that they need to put their

729
00:30:34,400 --> 00:30:35,930
money into that because it's a security

730
00:30:35,930 --> 00:30:38,780
concern so I think that's that's

731
00:30:38,780 --> 00:30:41,870
something I've seen few times and in a

732
00:30:41,870 --> 00:30:43,250
way it's really hard to defend in my

733
00:30:43,250 --> 00:30:45,220
opinion

734
00:30:45,220 --> 00:30:48,660
yeah so basically trying to

735
00:30:48,660 --> 00:30:51,600
with not years quantify but explain

736
00:30:51,600 --> 00:30:53,700
maybe the risks and the volume amount of

737
00:30:53,700 --> 00:30:56,540
not doing a specific security practice

738
00:30:56,540 --> 00:31:01,320
correct yeah yeah okay I have a

739
00:31:01,320 --> 00:31:04,050
different opinion about it is that I

740
00:31:04,050 --> 00:31:07,440
think agile is boon and curse at the

741
00:31:07,440 --> 00:31:09,360
same time and I would like to lean

742
00:31:09,360 --> 00:31:13,380
towards more in terms of advantages of

743
00:31:13,380 --> 00:31:15,210
it Rosoff agile which is that let's say

744
00:31:15,210 --> 00:31:17,160
people talk about hey you're developers

745
00:31:17,160 --> 00:31:18,870
are pushing code every nine seconds

746
00:31:18,870 --> 00:31:20,430
which means they might also be

747
00:31:20,430 --> 00:31:22,800
introducing one durability in 79 seconds

748
00:31:22,800 --> 00:31:27,210
why would it bolts are the same question

749
00:31:27,210 --> 00:31:29,160
right is the glass is half-full or

750
00:31:29,160 --> 00:31:31,680
half-empty right here I would like to

751
00:31:31,680 --> 00:31:34,230
think it's half-full because then you

752
00:31:34,230 --> 00:31:36,690
can fix issues every nine seconds you

753
00:31:36,690 --> 00:31:38,580
know so there are definitely you know

754
00:31:38,580 --> 00:31:40,530
benefits are of agile and if we do it

755
00:31:40,530 --> 00:31:42,930
properly then I think especially with

756
00:31:42,930 --> 00:31:46,110
respect to that model modeling I think

757
00:31:46,110 --> 00:31:49,550
it will can add a lot of value

758
00:31:51,890 --> 00:31:54,120
sir I'm wondering if this is something

759
00:31:54,120 --> 00:31:56,250
that is that you're saying with like

760
00:31:56,250 --> 00:32:00,810
cloud security like do do you see maybe

761
00:32:00,810 --> 00:32:02,280
as part of your experience do you see

762
00:32:02,280 --> 00:32:05,790
people adopt cloud specific technologies

763
00:32:05,790 --> 00:32:08,220
before or after the understand security

764
00:32:08,220 --> 00:32:11,580
implications as well or like how does

765
00:32:11,580 --> 00:32:14,460
how does security in and like integrate

766
00:32:14,460 --> 00:32:18,960
into that story well when you're moving

767
00:32:18,960 --> 00:32:22,440
to cloud you know it's you're still

768
00:32:22,440 --> 00:32:24,060
trying to basically achieve the same

769
00:32:24,060 --> 00:32:26,760
thing in security it's just how you get

770
00:32:26,760 --> 00:32:30,690
there will will often change and you

771
00:32:30,690 --> 00:32:32,550
know I think the ultimate goal is

772
00:32:32,550 --> 00:32:35,180
obviously to still remain secure and yes

773
00:32:35,180 --> 00:32:37,890
isn't it I mean it's very simple when we

774
00:32:37,890 --> 00:32:41,130
really kind of distill it down but how

775
00:32:41,130 --> 00:32:42,870
do you get there we'll change a lot and

776
00:32:42,870 --> 00:32:47,100
you know it's kind of part of that you

777
00:32:47,100 --> 00:32:49,020
know often businesses are looking at

778
00:32:49,020 --> 00:32:51,660
going agile at the same time it's part

779
00:32:51,660 --> 00:32:54,150
of the big big big transformation so you

780
00:32:54,150 --> 00:32:55,500
know often they're kind of doing things

781
00:32:55,500 --> 00:32:57,600
on lots of fun sittel be let's go a

782
00:32:57,600 --> 00:32:59,520
Gillette's you devil so think there's

783
00:32:59,520 --> 00:33:02,040
that cop let's move into the cloud - and

784
00:33:02,040 --> 00:33:05,400
and it's yeah it's like a big big

785
00:33:05,400 --> 00:33:07,020
challenge and it's a journey for

786
00:33:07,020 --> 00:33:08,670
everyone right you can't just go from

787
00:33:08,670 --> 00:33:11,580
zero to 100 straight away nobody can so

788
00:33:11,580 --> 00:33:14,490
so usually it's about and I think people

789
00:33:14,490 --> 00:33:16,320
forget that we don't talk about it as

790
00:33:16,320 --> 00:33:19,560
much is them then it's on a stage thing

791
00:33:19,560 --> 00:33:21,690
and so you'll have these interim stages

792
00:33:21,690 --> 00:33:23,130
where you might be doing like half on

793
00:33:23,130 --> 00:33:26,250
jail half half not because because you

794
00:33:26,250 --> 00:33:28,680
just can't and you know you just can't

795
00:33:28,680 --> 00:33:32,760
do it right and I think it's all kind of

796
00:33:32,760 --> 00:33:36,180
usually part of one one process and I

797
00:33:36,180 --> 00:33:38,430
think it's it's a journey and definitely

798
00:33:38,430 --> 00:33:40,830
the tools the processes and people right

799
00:33:40,830 --> 00:33:44,130
and as we said earlier I mean we've

800
00:33:44,130 --> 00:33:45,690
talked a lot about tooling but there is

801
00:33:45,690 --> 00:33:47,460
far more to it than that looks like a

802
00:33:47,460 --> 00:33:49,740
quarter of it you know we've got a look

803
00:33:49,740 --> 00:33:52,560
at the people the processes and and so

804
00:33:52,560 --> 00:33:54,420
all of these different things though you

805
00:33:54,420 --> 00:33:56,910
know everyone's got limits and and and

806
00:33:56,910 --> 00:33:58,830
only so much capacity to do some one

807
00:33:58,830 --> 00:34:01,560
thing at one time so you know it's about

808
00:34:01,560 --> 00:34:04,520
sort of businesses going to two stages

809
00:34:04,520 --> 00:34:06,870
organizations going two stages before

810
00:34:06,870 --> 00:34:08,668
they get to that final goal of being

811
00:34:08,668 --> 00:34:10,739
there and even then when they sort of I

812
00:34:10,739 --> 00:34:12,449
don't want to say that they're and

813
00:34:12,449 --> 00:34:14,100
they're finished you know you're still

814
00:34:14,100 --> 00:34:15,600
going to be constantly evolving and

815
00:34:15,600 --> 00:34:19,199
changing but yeah it's a big it's a big

816
00:34:19,199 --> 00:34:22,070
thing to do for anybody

817
00:34:22,070 --> 00:34:24,480
yeah I grew down and I think what I'm

818
00:34:24,480 --> 00:34:27,330
thinking even the most out of it is it's

819
00:34:27,330 --> 00:34:28,889
like security and we talked about it

820
00:34:28,889 --> 00:34:31,280
again we make a lot like in this talk is

821
00:34:31,280 --> 00:34:33,540
security is not an absolute thing as

822
00:34:33,540 --> 00:34:35,460
well there's no like silver lining of

823
00:34:35,460 --> 00:34:37,350
how to do something the silver sorry

824
00:34:37,350 --> 00:34:39,090
silver bullet and how to do something it

825
00:34:39,090 --> 00:34:42,960
is it is most of kind of I would not say

826
00:34:42,960 --> 00:34:45,870
do it as you go but there's no one thing

827
00:34:45,870 --> 00:34:47,879
now in a one guy line that this is how

828
00:34:47,879 --> 00:34:50,699
you need to do security for everyone

829
00:34:50,699 --> 00:34:53,370
since there's a lot of context involved

830
00:34:53,370 --> 00:34:55,440
in understanding what is right for you

831
00:34:55,440 --> 00:34:58,380
and I'm wondering like have you have you

832
00:34:58,380 --> 00:35:01,200
since something like like say kubernetes

833
00:35:01,200 --> 00:35:03,510
security best practices work for people

834
00:35:03,510 --> 00:35:05,220
I mean you could give them maybe that

835
00:35:05,220 --> 00:35:08,160
like maybe a starting point maybe it's

836
00:35:08,160 --> 00:35:10,290
not you know maybe not all those ten

837
00:35:10,290 --> 00:35:12,150
whatever best practices would apply but

838
00:35:12,150 --> 00:35:14,530
at least it will give them

839
00:35:14,530 --> 00:35:17,980
you know these people some someplace to

840
00:35:17,980 --> 00:35:19,840
begin with this is kind of like culture

841
00:35:19,840 --> 00:35:22,420
awareness you know practical they're

842
00:35:22,420 --> 00:35:24,190
related or you know engineer melanin

843
00:35:24,190 --> 00:35:26,290
security montrose if they could just

844
00:35:26,290 --> 00:35:30,520
just start with well if I can chime in

845
00:35:30,520 --> 00:35:33,160
on that everything on security

846
00:35:33,160 --> 00:35:35,380
I like we might look a smart with my son

847
00:35:35,380 --> 00:35:37,750
as mad but we are not everything we

848
00:35:37,750 --> 00:35:40,510
manage is try to get the systems and the

849
00:35:40,510 --> 00:35:42,580
people to have only the access to what

850
00:35:42,580 --> 00:35:44,530
they need to have and in kubernetes is

851
00:35:44,530 --> 00:35:47,140
exactly the same so if an application is

852
00:35:47,140 --> 00:35:48,790
supposed to access the database give

853
00:35:48,790 --> 00:35:50,320
access to just the database not

854
00:35:50,320 --> 00:35:51,820
everything else so you just keep their

855
00:35:51,820 --> 00:35:54,040
access to the minimum and that's already

856
00:35:54,040 --> 00:35:57,580
80% of the work so aside from that like

857
00:35:57,580 --> 00:35:58,600
again you know if you're running

858
00:35:58,600 --> 00:36:00,070
applications has wrote again it's an

859
00:36:00,070 --> 00:36:02,710
access problem and if you're poor

860
00:36:02,710 --> 00:36:04,630
disabled tomorrow volumes from the hosts

861
00:36:04,630 --> 00:36:07,090
it's an access problem so it's all you

862
00:36:07,090 --> 00:36:09,820
know analyze your system analyze your

863
00:36:09,820 --> 00:36:11,980
application see what is the minimum

864
00:36:11,980 --> 00:36:14,260
things that they need to access give the

865
00:36:14,260 --> 00:36:15,940
permissions and blacklist the reticles

866
00:36:15,940 --> 00:36:17,830
that's that would be my approach to

867
00:36:17,830 --> 00:36:20,380
every likes to secure for example a

868
00:36:20,380 --> 00:36:21,730
communities cluster or secure an

869
00:36:21,730 --> 00:36:23,500
infrastructure it applies that sort of

870
00:36:23,500 --> 00:36:25,630
sort of effect you see 90% of

871
00:36:25,630 --> 00:36:27,400
vulnerabilities is just incorrect level

872
00:36:27,400 --> 00:36:29,260
of access to some sort of resource or

873
00:36:29,260 --> 00:36:31,810
hope to a certain extent that would be

874
00:36:31,810 --> 00:36:38,050
my take with you I also would like to

875
00:36:38,050 --> 00:36:40,840
add one more thought and the question of

876
00:36:40,840 --> 00:36:42,460
threat modeling and edge approaches in

877
00:36:42,460 --> 00:36:44,890
general or threat modeling in January

878
00:36:44,890 --> 00:36:50,440
because I think many times when we deal

879
00:36:50,440 --> 00:36:52,450
with threat modeling is to different

880
00:36:52,450 --> 00:36:54,250
people do a threat model it's gonna come

881
00:36:54,250 --> 00:36:56,710
up with two different results it's very

882
00:36:56,710 --> 00:36:58,930
very much depending on who does it how

883
00:36:58,930 --> 00:37:01,420
experienced these people are etc which

884
00:37:01,420 --> 00:37:03,160
in its own right is already a problem

885
00:37:03,160 --> 00:37:06,100
and I've I've really tried very hard

886
00:37:06,100 --> 00:37:08,110
solving this this problem of threat

887
00:37:08,110 --> 00:37:11,440
modeling myself in the past and I have

888
00:37:11,440 --> 00:37:13,450
to admit I've failed because it's just

889
00:37:13,450 --> 00:37:16,660
such an hard work to figure out but I

890
00:37:16,660 --> 00:37:20,410
think maybe it's not it's not about it's

891
00:37:20,410 --> 00:37:22,120
not asking the right questions in that

892
00:37:22,120 --> 00:37:24,610
case right because ultimately if you

893
00:37:24,610 --> 00:37:28,170
look at applications nowadays we

894
00:37:28,170 --> 00:37:31,090
99% of applications will do something

895
00:37:31,090 --> 00:37:34,420
very very similar it's a web app it's a

896
00:37:34,420 --> 00:37:36,610
mobile app so it's not gonna nobody is

897
00:37:36,610 --> 00:37:37,270
going to come

898
00:37:37,270 --> 00:37:38,770
not a lot of people are coming up with

899
00:37:38,770 --> 00:37:41,140
an architecture it's like completely

900
00:37:41,140 --> 00:37:43,240
vastly different to any other

901
00:37:43,240 --> 00:37:45,370
application out there right so I think

902
00:37:45,370 --> 00:37:47,590
it's it's it's gonna be more beneficial

903
00:37:47,590 --> 00:37:49,510
thinking in terms of reference

904
00:37:49,510 --> 00:37:52,210
architectures that have been secure that

905
00:37:52,210 --> 00:37:53,590
have been bet that has been stressed

906
00:37:53,590 --> 00:37:56,890
tested by industry experts and by

907
00:37:56,890 --> 00:37:59,680
experts from many different areas that

908
00:37:59,680 --> 00:38:02,440
then become like the blueprint for how

909
00:38:02,440 --> 00:38:04,090
to actually come up with the right

910
00:38:04,090 --> 00:38:05,590
requirements to develop these

911
00:38:05,590 --> 00:38:09,100
applications and then it stops becoming

912
00:38:09,100 --> 00:38:12,310
this cat-and-mouse game where okay happy

913
00:38:12,310 --> 00:38:14,290
secured this now what about these new

914
00:38:14,290 --> 00:38:16,240
features is actually good or not because

915
00:38:16,240 --> 00:38:19,420
actually builds upon a very solid

916
00:38:19,420 --> 00:38:23,140
foundation that is a agreed-upon

917
00:38:23,140 --> 00:38:26,860
standard so to say yeah that makes sense

918
00:38:26,860 --> 00:38:29,920
yeah I think I think if we can apply

919
00:38:29,920 --> 00:38:31,360
that to other engineering perspective

920
00:38:31,360 --> 00:38:33,960
it's like if you take you know ten

921
00:38:33,960 --> 00:38:36,010
architects and you give them to design a

922
00:38:36,010 --> 00:38:37,570
system you'll probably get like 12

923
00:38:37,570 --> 00:38:41,440
different writers it's sort of context

924
00:38:41,440 --> 00:38:43,450
and experience and people will get their

925
00:38:43,450 --> 00:38:46,630
own perspectives and you know where they

926
00:38:46,630 --> 00:38:47,770
came from what I've done in the past

927
00:38:47,770 --> 00:38:50,980
into into a system and buy it or develop

928
00:38:50,980 --> 00:38:53,350
or design it in a different way security

929
00:38:53,350 --> 00:38:56,350
in a sense I guess it's kind of similar

930
00:38:56,350 --> 00:38:58,960
with the trade one activity except I

931
00:38:58,960 --> 00:39:02,080
think what it enables besides like

932
00:39:02,080 --> 00:39:03,580
generally probably being a good practice

933
00:39:03,580 --> 00:39:06,460
is maybe the discussion around security

934
00:39:06,460 --> 00:39:08,380
right because now you have you have like

935
00:39:08,380 --> 00:39:11,380
a way to facilitate you know let's let's

936
00:39:11,380 --> 00:39:12,700
understand what is the security

937
00:39:12,700 --> 00:39:14,230
perspective and there's a discussion

938
00:39:14,230 --> 00:39:16,060
being facilitated across you know

939
00:39:16,060 --> 00:39:17,770
different stakeholders building that so

940
00:39:17,770 --> 00:39:20,260
even though outcome might differ between

941
00:39:20,260 --> 00:39:22,210
you know three individuals doing the

942
00:39:22,210 --> 00:39:24,220
threat modeling exercise and if you're

943
00:39:24,220 --> 00:39:25,540
released you're creating some kind of

944
00:39:25,540 --> 00:39:27,730
awareness and culture of you know let's

945
00:39:27,730 --> 00:39:29,830
talk about security so I would say you

946
00:39:29,830 --> 00:39:31,300
know at least you're getting like 50%

947
00:39:31,300 --> 00:39:34,240
buy-in at that point maybe just by doing

948
00:39:34,240 --> 00:39:39,220
that yeah totally yeah I think that's an

949
00:39:39,220 --> 00:39:42,720
interesting alternative to consider

950
00:39:44,059 --> 00:39:46,980
cool do anyone want to chime in on any

951
00:39:46,980 --> 00:39:49,349
other of these topics or should we move

952
00:39:49,349 --> 00:39:53,880
on to maybe some pooling ideas I have I

953
00:39:53,880 --> 00:39:55,920
can't wanted man what is my question if

954
00:39:55,920 --> 00:39:58,260
there is time and yes because we are

955
00:39:58,260 --> 00:39:59,640
talking about security as if it was a

956
00:39:59,640 --> 00:40:01,349
uniform why not as if it was a uniform

957
00:40:01,349 --> 00:40:03,390
thing but as if it was kind of like an

958
00:40:03,390 --> 00:40:06,390
approach size and shape for everyone but

959
00:40:06,390 --> 00:40:08,520
what about highly regulated industries

960
00:40:08,520 --> 00:40:10,950
because if you read the text on the ISO

961
00:40:10,950 --> 00:40:13,890
27001 and similares like it's a scary

962
00:40:13,890 --> 00:40:15,809
like you're really going to struggle to

963
00:40:15,809 --> 00:40:17,849
to do DevOps in a company which is

964
00:40:17,849 --> 00:40:20,309
regulated it has to be audited the ISO

965
00:40:20,309 --> 00:40:22,890
like it's really really hard so same

966
00:40:22,890 --> 00:40:26,130
thing with security yeah I think that

967
00:40:26,130 --> 00:40:28,020
after that statement David I'm gonna

968
00:40:28,020 --> 00:40:29,700
check that to my flight back doesn't

969
00:40:29,700 --> 00:40:39,150
have a point 737 any regulated

970
00:40:39,150 --> 00:40:43,710
industries ultimately Boystown - what

971
00:40:43,710 --> 00:40:46,230
business wants to do and then even banks

972
00:40:46,230 --> 00:40:48,960
who are highly regulated they are

973
00:40:48,960 --> 00:40:51,839
innovating at a faster pace now they

974
00:40:51,839 --> 00:40:55,319
look at mon-sol and then look at Capital

975
00:40:55,319 --> 00:40:58,410
One they are doing security I think

976
00:40:58,410 --> 00:41:00,089
that's a cop's it have ops whatever you

977
00:41:00,089 --> 00:41:01,950
like to call it in a very highly

978
00:41:01,950 --> 00:41:04,170
regulated environment and and we have

979
00:41:04,170 --> 00:41:05,309
been seeing this right for example

980
00:41:05,309 --> 00:41:08,430
before DevOps there was agile right and

981
00:41:08,430 --> 00:41:10,470
before that we had bought full model but

982
00:41:10,470 --> 00:41:12,290
even banks are now higher these days

983
00:41:12,290 --> 00:41:22,680
yeah yeah right

984
00:41:22,680 --> 00:41:27,150
so didn't want to get out these stock

985
00:41:27,150 --> 00:41:28,970
weights maybe some kind of like

986
00:41:28,970 --> 00:41:32,640
takeaways from your experience sharing

987
00:41:32,640 --> 00:41:35,579
with everyone else it all starts with

988
00:41:35,579 --> 00:41:37,260
quit a couple of my own and then we can

989
00:41:37,260 --> 00:41:38,970
do like a roundtable between everyone

990
00:41:38,970 --> 00:41:43,500
else so I will take it to the I'll take

991
00:41:43,500 --> 00:41:45,780
it to the tooling perspective and just

992
00:41:45,780 --> 00:41:48,270
share some of that experience basically

993
00:41:48,270 --> 00:41:51,780
been working during summer with some

994
00:41:51,780 --> 00:41:54,130
open source projects

995
00:41:54,130 --> 00:41:58,200
Verdejo and you know just invited a talk

996
00:41:58,200 --> 00:42:01,950
with with one picado with daniel roof

997
00:42:01,950 --> 00:42:05,319
which idea from from that project so all

998
00:42:05,319 --> 00:42:07,059
working on open source project building

999
00:42:07,059 --> 00:42:09,849
kind of an NPM local proxy or thing that

1000
00:42:09,849 --> 00:42:12,579
you could use and what we started doing

1001
00:42:12,579 --> 00:42:16,769
is trying to to take security and and

1002
00:42:16,769 --> 00:42:19,660
push that into open source project

1003
00:42:19,660 --> 00:42:21,250
maintainer is like the developers that

1004
00:42:21,250 --> 00:42:23,650
do that because a lot of times we we all

1005
00:42:23,650 --> 00:42:25,779
use open source we all kind of like

1006
00:42:25,779 --> 00:42:27,849
affected by things like a supply chain

1007
00:42:27,849 --> 00:42:30,009
attack or something like that and one of

1008
00:42:30,009 --> 00:42:31,240
the things that we wanted to do with our

1009
00:42:31,240 --> 00:42:33,700
project is see if we can you know just

1010
00:42:33,700 --> 00:42:35,380
just follow some kind of best practices

1011
00:42:35,380 --> 00:42:38,589
so few things that we did you know media

1012
00:42:38,589 --> 00:42:41,140
take away that you can do is first of

1013
00:42:41,140 --> 00:42:43,119
all you know making sure everyone on the

1014
00:42:43,119 --> 00:42:44,920
project has to available you know when

1015
00:42:44,920 --> 00:42:49,839
NPM do a enabled kind of hye-jin is like

1016
00:42:49,839 --> 00:42:53,740
basic security capabilities as well from

1017
00:42:53,740 --> 00:42:55,720
like their developer perspective and the

1018
00:42:55,720 --> 00:42:58,299
other two things that we try to do you

1019
00:42:58,299 --> 00:43:01,650
like bit into the dev suck-ups

1020
00:43:01,650 --> 00:43:05,200
you know the DevOps pipeline if you want

1021
00:43:05,200 --> 00:43:07,240
to if you want to push it like that one

1022
00:43:07,240 --> 00:43:09,759
of them is first of all we had

1023
00:43:09,759 --> 00:43:12,039
introduced for acclimate hook that

1024
00:43:12,039 --> 00:43:13,809
allows you to you know to check that

1025
00:43:13,809 --> 00:43:16,150
there's no sensitive things being

1026
00:43:16,150 --> 00:43:19,180
committed into the repository which

1027
00:43:19,180 --> 00:43:21,039
which was quickie no implementing it

1028
00:43:21,039 --> 00:43:23,410
like technical perspective of it it is

1029
00:43:23,410 --> 00:43:26,200
kind of easy making sure that things

1030
00:43:26,200 --> 00:43:28,619
actually in a workflow that does not

1031
00:43:28,619 --> 00:43:30,940
bother or interrupt too much the

1032
00:43:30,940 --> 00:43:33,849
developers is a whole different story so

1033
00:43:33,849 --> 00:43:35,319
I'm gonna tell whether this was a bit

1034
00:43:35,319 --> 00:43:37,440
tricky finding the good way to do that

1035
00:43:37,440 --> 00:43:39,789
pretty sure that there's two ways that

1036
00:43:39,789 --> 00:43:41,829
we can improve on it but we actually do

1037
00:43:41,829 --> 00:43:43,930
have it so developers on without you now

1038
00:43:43,930 --> 00:43:47,109
using having like Africa milk introduced

1039
00:43:47,109 --> 00:43:48,210
to the workflows

1040
00:43:48,210 --> 00:43:50,769
the other thing that we have done with

1041
00:43:50,769 --> 00:43:53,140
our project is through a bit of a

1042
00:43:53,140 --> 00:43:54,940
personal research around log files are

1043
00:43:54,940 --> 00:43:57,130
able to introduce this thing of like a

1044
00:43:57,130 --> 00:43:59,170
log file link which you know gives you

1045
00:43:59,170 --> 00:44:02,259
again to either a comet or something

1046
00:44:02,259 --> 00:44:04,150
that you would run on on a PR such as

1047
00:44:04,150 --> 00:44:04,960
you know a box

1048
00:44:04,960 --> 00:44:07,630
I plan or sky build you would be able to

1049
00:44:07,630 --> 00:44:09,849
ensure that your log file you know from

1050
00:44:09,849 --> 00:44:11,560
a static analysis kind of thing does not

1051
00:44:11,560 --> 00:44:14,560
have any good things in it everything is

1052
00:44:14,560 --> 00:44:16,270
a trusted source for profit or you can

1053
00:44:16,270 --> 00:44:18,369
set it up in different ways but again

1054
00:44:18,369 --> 00:44:20,170
they say this goes a long way I think in

1055
00:44:20,170 --> 00:44:22,930
terms of in terms of like open source

1056
00:44:22,930 --> 00:44:25,359
quality in how they embrace security

1057
00:44:25,359 --> 00:44:27,130
because you know running you know

1058
00:44:27,130 --> 00:44:28,690
whatever NPM audit or speaker stuff like

1059
00:44:28,690 --> 00:44:31,800
that is is is one thing but then

1060
00:44:31,800 --> 00:44:34,630
integrating security into a project in

1061
00:44:34,630 --> 00:44:36,520
from a developer perspective is a big

1062
00:44:36,520 --> 00:44:39,369
whole lot of things as well so these are

1063
00:44:39,369 --> 00:44:41,230
some of my takeaways in terms of you

1064
00:44:41,230 --> 00:44:43,180
know just immediate tooling or not just

1065
00:44:43,180 --> 00:44:44,950
practices that you could go ahead and do

1066
00:44:44,950 --> 00:44:48,990
for open source projects welcome to uh

1067
00:44:48,990 --> 00:44:51,190
anyone else did you secure their own as

1068
00:44:51,190 --> 00:44:59,380
well like for example for me and if you

1069
00:44:59,380 --> 00:45:02,650
cannot draw your security strategy in a

1070
00:45:02,650 --> 00:45:05,020
single page it's wrong because nobody

1071
00:45:05,020 --> 00:45:06,820
will be able to understand it so you

1072
00:45:06,820 --> 00:45:08,349
need to make it as simple as possible so

1073
00:45:08,349 --> 00:45:09,910
that you can treat it in a very small

1074
00:45:09,910 --> 00:45:12,369
space and everybody will be able with

1075
00:45:12,369 --> 00:45:14,830
just with one eight sites make sure that

1076
00:45:14,830 --> 00:45:16,480
they understand what's going on and that

1077
00:45:16,480 --> 00:45:17,950
doesn't mean completely define

1078
00:45:17,950 --> 00:45:19,510
everything on that page for the high

1079
00:45:19,510 --> 00:45:21,130
level architecture of your security

1080
00:45:21,130 --> 00:45:23,680
should be captured in a very very small

1081
00:45:23,680 --> 00:45:25,480
portion of paper and should be able to

1082
00:45:25,480 --> 00:45:28,359
be explained by everyone that's to me I

1083
00:45:28,359 --> 00:45:29,950
think simplicity is the most important

1084
00:45:29,950 --> 00:45:31,930
thing because if again if you end up

1085
00:45:31,930 --> 00:45:33,310
going into a very complex security

1086
00:45:33,310 --> 00:45:35,320
pipeline with very sophisticated tools

1087
00:45:35,320 --> 00:45:39,070
and very kind of like process like many

1088
00:45:39,070 --> 00:45:40,839
complex process that nobody really

1089
00:45:40,839 --> 00:45:43,210
understand so nobody really sees the end

1090
00:45:43,210 --> 00:45:44,950
of that it's gonna be like completely

1091
00:45:44,950 --> 00:45:46,240
ignored and people will find that we're

1092
00:45:46,240 --> 00:45:48,849
wrong whereas if you just tell them you

1093
00:45:48,849 --> 00:45:50,740
need to do input validation output

1094
00:45:50,740 --> 00:45:53,080
encoding and make sure that you prepared

1095
00:45:53,080 --> 00:45:54,460
statements that's gonna be probably

1096
00:45:54,460 --> 00:45:57,430
about 60% of security in an application

1097
00:45:57,430 --> 00:45:59,440
and that's like what three phrases so

1098
00:45:59,440 --> 00:46:01,990
that's the type of information you need

1099
00:46:01,990 --> 00:46:07,500
to capture in there again I'm sorry

1100
00:46:07,500 --> 00:46:08,859
looks good

1101
00:46:08,859 --> 00:46:12,609
I I did like açaí very did really

1102
00:46:12,609 --> 00:46:15,070
simplicity is really important because

1103
00:46:15,070 --> 00:46:18,160
people simply see inconsistency is is

1104
00:46:18,160 --> 00:46:18,640
the

1105
00:46:18,640 --> 00:46:21,150
forward because it's the only way that

1106
00:46:21,150 --> 00:46:23,079
it's the only way that people will

1107
00:46:23,079 --> 00:46:24,490
understand what's going on and that's

1108
00:46:24,490 --> 00:46:26,859
not to sort of you know that's not

1109
00:46:26,859 --> 00:46:30,369
slight on any users or businesses it's

1110
00:46:30,369 --> 00:46:33,640
just that when you're looking at big

1111
00:46:33,640 --> 00:46:36,490
complex environments or even smaller

1112
00:46:36,490 --> 00:46:38,680
ones it's not consistent people can't

1113
00:46:38,680 --> 00:46:40,630
understand what's happening and then you

1114
00:46:40,630 --> 00:46:42,130
end up with gaps and that's how we end

1115
00:46:42,130 --> 00:46:44,440
up with security issues I mean it's not

1116
00:46:44,440 --> 00:46:46,839
a new concept of course but I think in

1117
00:46:46,839 --> 00:46:48,819
in these sort of complex hybrid

1118
00:46:48,819 --> 00:46:50,769
environments and with you know

1119
00:46:50,769 --> 00:46:52,720
everybody's data all over the place now

1120
00:46:52,720 --> 00:46:55,329
you know in on crammed in the cloud etc

1121
00:46:55,329 --> 00:46:57,549
you know you've got you've got to train

1122
00:46:57,549 --> 00:47:05,250
do it that way it's the only way yeah

1123
00:47:06,960 --> 00:47:10,269
yeah so from from from my experience I

1124
00:47:10,269 --> 00:47:12,760
think a couple of things which the with

1125
00:47:12,760 --> 00:47:14,289
drastically improves deficit cuts

1126
00:47:14,289 --> 00:47:16,630
tooling is that we should not fail the

1127
00:47:16,630 --> 00:47:18,970
bills at least when they are maybe let

1128
00:47:18,970 --> 00:47:21,760
mature at level one in two because as

1129
00:47:21,760 --> 00:47:24,160
Steven was saying he was indirectly

1130
00:47:24,160 --> 00:47:26,470
pointing to it's okay sassed and other

1131
00:47:26,470 --> 00:47:28,930
toolings are notoriously known for false

1132
00:47:28,930 --> 00:47:31,920
positives so we have to be mindful of

1133
00:47:31,920 --> 00:47:35,470
failing bills of our developers on based

1134
00:47:35,470 --> 00:47:37,930
on our tooling data unless we have

1135
00:47:37,930 --> 00:47:40,210
written custom boots to custom rule sets

1136
00:47:40,210 --> 00:47:43,059
to get rid of false positives it's a

1137
00:47:43,059 --> 00:47:44,710
sure recipe for disaster if you fail

1138
00:47:44,710 --> 00:47:47,470
your bills so I think that's one thing I

1139
00:47:47,470 --> 00:47:50,259
definitely saw a lot in when it comes to

1140
00:47:50,259 --> 00:47:54,930
security pipelines and then definitely

1141
00:47:54,930 --> 00:47:58,890
try implementing baseline scans in

1142
00:47:58,890 --> 00:48:01,329
development pipelines and then maybe

1143
00:48:01,329 --> 00:48:05,259
have full-blown static analysis dynamic

1144
00:48:05,259 --> 00:48:09,160
analysis scans on like QA pipeline so I

1145
00:48:09,160 --> 00:48:11,740
think that's one more thing we saw and

1146
00:48:11,740 --> 00:48:13,359
then as we were talking about threat

1147
00:48:13,359 --> 00:48:15,549
modeling I think right now we have all

1148
00:48:15,549 --> 00:48:18,220
technological pieces to do security s

1149
00:48:18,220 --> 00:48:20,650
code as well so I think trying to

1150
00:48:20,650 --> 00:48:22,720
convert everything like how little Ann

1151
00:48:22,720 --> 00:48:26,589
was talking about three three your

1152
00:48:26,589 --> 00:48:28,569
pre-commit works and stuff like that

1153
00:48:28,569 --> 00:48:30,680
definitely adds a lot of value when it

1154
00:48:30,680 --> 00:48:33,590
to tolling as well yeah just my two

1155
00:48:33,590 --> 00:48:35,140
cents

1156
00:48:35,140 --> 00:48:38,270
fully agree and and to add to this I

1157
00:48:38,270 --> 00:48:42,170
think it should be viewed from a very

1158
00:48:42,170 --> 00:48:45,020
high level right so number one we we've

1159
00:48:45,020 --> 00:48:48,950
already covered known vulnerabilities in

1160
00:48:48,950 --> 00:48:50,990
third-party components right which is

1161
00:48:50,990 --> 00:48:52,520
also called software composition

1162
00:48:52,520 --> 00:48:54,980
analysis this is a very important part

1163
00:48:54,980 --> 00:48:58,520
to have included in in every scan or in

1164
00:48:58,520 --> 00:49:00,950
every check of your of your repository

1165
00:49:00,950 --> 00:49:03,920
and on top of that like here has just

1166
00:49:03,920 --> 00:49:06,380
shared in its like prevent secrets from

1167
00:49:06,380 --> 00:49:08,780
leaking to source control like for the

1168
00:49:08,780 --> 00:49:10,880
Valachi or project another very

1169
00:49:10,880 --> 00:49:13,370
important part because nowadays the

1170
00:49:13,370 --> 00:49:16,370
amount of API keys and and tokens and

1171
00:49:16,370 --> 00:49:19,310
other sensitive information that we have

1172
00:49:19,310 --> 00:49:21,260
in our repository once this is exposed

1173
00:49:21,260 --> 00:49:23,300
it came immediately lead to complete

1174
00:49:23,300 --> 00:49:26,480
compromise of our entire AWS so a sure

1175
00:49:26,480 --> 00:49:29,300
or whatever else cloud platform which is

1176
00:49:29,300 --> 00:49:31,700
super critical right and it can be just

1177
00:49:31,700 --> 00:49:34,150
one tiny mistake to make this happen so

1178
00:49:34,150 --> 00:49:37,010
SES off to composition analysis SAS

1179
00:49:37,010 --> 00:49:38,510
which is the sensitive information

1180
00:49:38,510 --> 00:49:41,570
scanning and of course also the bespoke

1181
00:49:41,570 --> 00:49:43,400
code that is being written right because

1182
00:49:43,400 --> 00:49:45,230
even though that most of the modern

1183
00:49:45,230 --> 00:49:47,960
applications are actually let's say 80

1184
00:49:47,960 --> 00:49:49,760
percent based on open source components

1185
00:49:49,760 --> 00:49:52,070
what about these twenty percent could

1186
00:49:52,070 --> 00:49:53,840
really are the Pistons not check and the

1187
00:49:53,840 --> 00:49:56,990
important piece that is you know set in

1188
00:49:56,990 --> 00:49:58,520
your application apart I think this is

1189
00:49:58,520 --> 00:50:02,660
also very much important to look at this

1190
00:50:02,660 --> 00:50:05,900
and this is what also my Imran said in

1191
00:50:05,900 --> 00:50:08,420
terms of you know if these tools have

1192
00:50:08,420 --> 00:50:10,400
too many false positives one of the key

1193
00:50:10,400 --> 00:50:12,050
features you should look for is

1194
00:50:12,050 --> 00:50:14,360
differential scans because if you're

1195
00:50:14,360 --> 00:50:15,980
working in pull requests assess your

1196
00:50:15,980 --> 00:50:18,230
modern development team workflow then

1197
00:50:18,230 --> 00:50:20,750
you can already limit the amount of

1198
00:50:20,750 --> 00:50:23,150
noise but just looking at the issues

1199
00:50:23,150 --> 00:50:25,250
that are introduced miss view changed

1200
00:50:25,250 --> 00:50:26,960
lines of code in this pull request or

1201
00:50:26,960 --> 00:50:29,840
merge request if you get level and I say

1202
00:50:29,840 --> 00:50:33,140
this with if you combine these you get

1203
00:50:33,140 --> 00:50:35,780
some very very good results across a

1204
00:50:35,780 --> 00:50:39,770
broad range of threats that could and no

1205
00:50:39,770 --> 00:50:43,630
big options for your application as well

1206
00:50:48,520 --> 00:50:53,270
David server any kind of last takeaways

1207
00:50:53,270 --> 00:50:55,540
from you as well

1208
00:50:55,540 --> 00:50:57,530
anything you want to share with the rest

1209
00:50:57,530 --> 00:51:05,270
of us from me yeah if I can I know well

1210
00:51:05,270 --> 00:51:06,950
for you it's like just evening but for

1211
00:51:06,950 --> 00:51:08,270
Sarah it's like you know it's she she

1212
00:51:08,270 --> 00:51:11,210
still the other three cups of coffee

1213
00:51:11,210 --> 00:51:15,580
probably by now mm well yeah I mean like

1214
00:51:15,580 --> 00:51:19,430
their final exposure to security is the

1215
00:51:19,430 --> 00:51:20,990
engineers they were sorta building the

1216
00:51:20,990 --> 00:51:22,880
product or the application or whatever

1217
00:51:22,880 --> 00:51:24,860
you are building so if you are working

1218
00:51:24,860 --> 00:51:26,690
on security make sure that you regularly

1219
00:51:26,690 --> 00:51:29,060
catch up with them because if the

1220
00:51:29,060 --> 00:51:30,980
environment is not favorable what is

1221
00:51:30,980 --> 00:51:32,390
gonna happen is they're developers will

1222
00:51:32,390 --> 00:51:33,650
already know their way around your

1223
00:51:33,650 --> 00:51:36,140
security policies but you want and you

1224
00:51:36,140 --> 00:51:37,520
won't notice until it's too late

1225
00:51:37,520 --> 00:51:40,430
so I'd say having a very good culture of

1226
00:51:40,430 --> 00:51:43,040
not clashing IT departments versus

1227
00:51:43,040 --> 00:51:45,230
security it's probably develop the first

1228
00:51:45,230 --> 00:51:47,600
step into into a reasonable security

1229
00:51:47,600 --> 00:51:50,750
policy like de-escalate the tensions

1230
00:51:50,750 --> 00:51:53,020
between security and between the

1231
00:51:53,020 --> 00:51:54,860
engineering department it's super

1232
00:51:54,860 --> 00:51:56,990
important is what you say later so we

1233
00:51:56,990 --> 00:51:58,730
were talking about the Security's always

1234
00:51:58,730 --> 00:52:01,010
then they know they know people it

1235
00:52:01,010 --> 00:52:02,510
should be like that it should be like

1236
00:52:02,510 --> 00:52:04,490
not purchase a solution for your product

1237
00:52:04,490 --> 00:52:06,620
instead of just plain no because

1238
00:52:06,620 --> 00:52:08,420
otherwise like you won't feel like

1239
00:52:08,420 --> 00:52:16,340
approachable mm-hmm yeah yeah it's bad

1240
00:52:16,340 --> 00:52:18,800
you brought us back to cultural aspect

1241
00:52:18,800 --> 00:52:22,940
of that sort of seconds I mean I see it

1242
00:52:22,940 --> 00:52:24,200
every day like I see it

1243
00:52:24,200 --> 00:52:26,630
in many projects at work on the past and

1244
00:52:26,630 --> 00:52:28,340
he's like it's always the same like you

1245
00:52:28,340 --> 00:52:30,080
can have as many fancy tools as you want

1246
00:52:30,080 --> 00:52:32,420
if the process is not correct and the

1247
00:52:32,420 --> 00:52:33,680
mindset of the people is not correct

1248
00:52:33,680 --> 00:52:37,130
there is always a way around always yeah

1249
00:52:37,130 --> 00:52:43,000
connecting oh yeah

1250
00:52:45,620 --> 00:52:48,480
right now I'm just just curious on

1251
00:52:48,480 --> 00:52:50,790
whether Stephane and Muhammad are gonna

1252
00:52:50,790 --> 00:52:54,480
go back to sleep or just do a midnight

1253
00:52:54,480 --> 00:52:58,740
hacking something I'm not asleep for me

1254
00:52:58,740 --> 00:53:02,450
I sleep for me for sure

1255
00:53:05,420 --> 00:53:09,960
yeah okay now I I think I have one

1256
00:53:09,960 --> 00:53:11,940
question for all of you you don't have

1257
00:53:11,940 --> 00:53:13,740
to answer me but maybe think about it

1258
00:53:13,740 --> 00:53:16,230
right like everyone is asking developers

1259
00:53:16,230 --> 00:53:18,930
to do lot of work for example you know

1260
00:53:18,930 --> 00:53:21,270
with agile people started talking about

1261
00:53:21,270 --> 00:53:23,310
hey we should not be doing QA we should

1262
00:53:23,310 --> 00:53:25,650
not have a queue as a separate silo but

1263
00:53:25,650 --> 00:53:27,540
rather developers should also be doing

1264
00:53:27,540 --> 00:53:30,570
in a QA you whatever you call it you

1265
00:53:30,570 --> 00:53:34,590
know EXPN or whatever and then you know

1266
00:53:34,590 --> 00:53:37,440
the design guys also came here UX is

1267
00:53:37,440 --> 00:53:38,910
very important is everyone's

1268
00:53:38,910 --> 00:53:40,980
responsibility security is also

1269
00:53:40,980 --> 00:53:42,840
everyone's responsibility the developers

1270
00:53:42,840 --> 00:53:45,990
should also be doing it now are they

1271
00:53:45,990 --> 00:53:47,670
supposed to just do development or

1272
00:53:47,670 --> 00:53:52,560
Security UX testing you know food for

1273
00:53:52,560 --> 00:53:56,370
thought yeah I can tell you a really

1274
00:53:56,370 --> 00:53:58,650
interesting story of that so in my

1275
00:53:58,650 --> 00:54:00,750
students in college they struggle to

1276
00:54:00,750 --> 00:54:02,070
find the furniture because of these

1277
00:54:02,070 --> 00:54:03,960
because 10 years ago it was okay to be a

1278
00:54:03,960 --> 00:54:06,240
Java developer now you need to be a Java

1279
00:54:06,240 --> 00:54:08,100
developer how soon or yeah but that's

1280
00:54:08,100 --> 00:54:10,470
what you need to know AWS and also you

1281
00:54:10,470 --> 00:54:12,540
need to know security and the barrier is

1282
00:54:12,540 --> 00:54:14,100
going up and up and up but the education

1283
00:54:14,100 --> 00:54:17,520
is staying there because like the kind

1284
00:54:17,520 --> 00:54:19,620
of like the academic world does not

1285
00:54:19,620 --> 00:54:21,090
really close at the same time as that as

1286
00:54:21,090 --> 00:54:23,310
the industry so it will take years to

1287
00:54:23,310 --> 00:54:25,410
catch up if it ever catch up cuts up so

1288
00:54:25,410 --> 00:54:28,080
yeah it's a I can see that as well going

1289
00:54:28,080 --> 00:54:29,430
on around like the amount of things that

1290
00:54:29,430 --> 00:54:31,920
you need to know to be mildly productive

1291
00:54:31,920 --> 00:54:36,420
it's a scary welcome to fourth back

1292
00:54:36,420 --> 00:54:43,920
developers world yeah they're guests

1293
00:54:43,920 --> 00:54:46,050
Ramon like just see this guy that wasn't

1294
00:54:46,050 --> 00:54:48,240
kind of the parties with their kind of

1295
00:54:48,240 --> 00:54:50,460
the drones the blades they fluid like

1296
00:54:50,460 --> 00:54:53,630
touching everything

1297
00:54:55,940 --> 00:55:00,480
right go ahead go ahead then and I was

1298
00:55:00,480 --> 00:55:03,470
just think I'd be doomed

1299
00:55:05,090 --> 00:55:08,370
we have always just realizing it now

1300
00:55:08,370 --> 00:55:09,270
that's it

1301
00:55:09,270 --> 00:55:12,300
I'd say we are blessed like which other

1302
00:55:12,300 --> 00:55:13,920
industry you have exposure to too many

1303
00:55:13,920 --> 00:55:16,860
aspects of the same like no no like none

1304
00:55:16,860 --> 00:55:18,180
of them like if you are an architect you

1305
00:55:18,180 --> 00:55:20,550
will be like doing a key to things but

1306
00:55:20,550 --> 00:55:22,530
here you would need to understand the

1307
00:55:22,530 --> 00:55:23,640
business you would need to understand

1308
00:55:23,640 --> 00:55:24,900
technology you need to understand the

1309
00:55:24,900 --> 00:55:28,520
people and it's like yeah it's amazing

1310
00:55:28,520 --> 00:55:35,010
never a dull moment that's for sure our

1311
00:55:35,010 --> 00:55:38,880
jobs are secure for one more decade I

1312
00:55:38,880 --> 00:55:43,320
would go to top exactly what I was just

1313
00:55:43,320 --> 00:55:46,020
about well maybe not in the next decade

1314
00:55:46,020 --> 00:55:48,120
but I'm sure on the poor side it keeps

1315
00:55:48,120 --> 00:55:51,200
it all in gainful employment

1316
00:55:57,140 --> 00:56:00,960
