hello everyone

2
00:00:04,609 --> 00:00:07,559
everyone welcome to the secure developer

3
00:00:07,559 --> 00:00:08,880
so for those who don't know who we are

4
00:00:08,880 --> 00:00:10,650
we're an inclusive community that aims

5
00:00:10,650 --> 00:00:12,809
to educate and enable developers in

6
00:00:12,809 --> 00:00:14,849
application security today I'm joined by

7
00:00:14,849 --> 00:00:17,430
Tanya jealous you'll be talking about

8
00:00:17,430 --> 00:00:19,620
why we can't build secure software but

9
00:00:19,620 --> 00:00:20,670
before we get into that I want to

10
00:00:20,670 --> 00:00:22,620

- and I'm the community manager here at

12
00:00:24,360 --> 00:00:26,250
sneaked and the human behind the scenes

13
00:00:26,250 --> 00:00:28,380

24
00:00:48,269 --> 00:00:50,399
tanya today the other thing that's

25
00:00:50,399 --> 00:00:52,199

hand corner of your screen you'll see a

27
00:00:53,309 --> 00:00:55,800
little cog if you click that and put

28
00:00:55,800 --> 00:00:57,719

developer tears will cheer I sneaked our

36
00:01:14,219 --> 00:01:17,039
aim is to reduce a vendor neutral space

37
00:01:17,039 --> 00:01:18,689
to discuss application security so we

38
00:01:18,689 --> 00:01:21,509
really hope you enjoy it and but that's

39
00:01:21,509 --> 00:01:23,490
enough for me without further ado I'm

40
00:01:23,490 --> 00:01:25,409
going to hand you over to Tanya sorry

paranoid awesome hi everyone I am Tanya

62
00:02:41,130 --> 00:02:41,760
Jenkin

63
00:02:41,760 --> 00:02:43,769
I'm going to talk to you today about why

64
00:02:43,769 --> 00:02:46,290
we why can't we build secure software I

65
00:02:46,290 --> 00:02:50,430
wrote this talk in 2016 or I started

66
00:02:50,430 --> 00:02:52,410
researching it then and yeah I guess I

67
00:02:52,410 --> 00:02:54,959
wrote it took quite a while because my

68
00:02:54,959 --> 00:02:57,660
dad and I were on the phone and he's

69
00:02:57,660 --> 00:03:00,239
like Tanya it's 2016 why can't we build

70
00:03:00,239 --> 00:03:02,790
secure software yet like what's going on

71
00:03:02,790 --> 00:03:09,150
like you should really get on it and I

72
00:03:09,150 --> 00:03:10,890
was like oh you're right dad it should

73
00:03:10,890 --> 00:03:14,989
have solved that by now and so then I

74
00:03:14,989 --> 00:03:17,190
started researching some of the reasons

75
00:03:17,190 --> 00:03:19,380
why we can't build secure software and I

76
00:03:19,380 --> 00:03:21,630
wrote this talk so I'm gonna present a

77
00:03:21,630 --> 00:03:23,250
lot of ideas of things that have worked

78
00:03:23,250 --> 00:03:25,859
for me and I hope that some of them help

79
00:03:25,859 --> 00:03:32,489
you but let's do this okay so yeah who

80
00:03:32,489 --> 00:03:37,170
here has felt this before I as a

81
00:03:37,170 --> 00:03:39,090
software developer a really long time

82
00:03:39,090 --> 00:03:43,880
and and I felt this the first time I did

83
00:03:43,880 --> 00:03:46,709
so I as a software developer and our

84
00:03:46,709 --> 00:03:48,150
security team got our first

85
00:03:48,150 --> 00:03:50,280
vulnerability assessment scanning tool

86
00:03:50,280 --> 00:03:56,190
and I lucky me I was the first developer

87
00:03:56,190 --> 00:03:58,739
part that have to go through it and they

88
00:03:58,739 --> 00:04:00,569
ran it through the scanning tool and

89
00:04:00,569 --> 00:04:02,910
emailed me this report that could have

90
00:04:02,910 --> 00:04:04,650
been written in another language other

91
00:04:04,650 --> 00:04:06,359
than English or French the ones I know

92
00:04:06,359 --> 00:04:08,970
and it would have made just as much

93
00:04:08,970 --> 00:04:12,239
sense it had so many things in it and I

94
00:04:12,239 --> 00:04:15,030
wrote them back and I was like I don't

95
00:04:15,030 --> 00:04:16,380
know what this any any of this means

96
00:04:16,380 --> 00:04:18,029
like can we talk about this report like

97
00:04:18,029 --> 00:04:21,029
how do I fix these bugs and the man told

98
00:04:21,029 --> 00:04:25,590
me you should know

99
00:04:25,590 --> 00:04:28,360
he's like you're a software developer

100
00:04:28,360 --> 00:04:31,810
you should know this like and made me

101
00:04:31,810 --> 00:04:34,270
feel shame basically so I went back to

102
00:04:34,270 --> 00:04:36,810
my desk and I did a lot of high-quality

103
00:04:36,810 --> 00:04:42,219
googling and and then I came up with

104
00:04:42,219 --> 00:04:44,409
some fixes and sends it back to him and

105
00:04:44,409 --> 00:04:47,289
he ran the scanner again and it found

106
00:04:47,289 --> 00:04:49,000
different things which made no sense to

107
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:52,240
me and then I tried to fix those things

108
00:04:52,240 --> 00:04:54,189
and then I sent it back to him and then

109
00:04:54,189 --> 00:04:57,550
the third time I passed and you know I

110
00:04:57,550 --> 00:05:00,460
said oh gosh I was really hurt like you

111
00:05:00,460 --> 00:05:02,020
know I never had to do any of those

112
00:05:02,020 --> 00:05:04,389
things before and he told me that if I

113
00:05:04,389 --> 00:05:07,150
was a good software developer that I

114
00:05:07,150 --> 00:05:08,500
never would have had any of those

115
00:05:08,500 --> 00:05:10,020
problems in the first place

116
00:05:10,020 --> 00:05:13,300
and this sought me a valuable lesson as

117
00:05:13,300 --> 00:05:15,580
a software developer and that was that I

118
00:05:15,580 --> 00:05:17,289
should avoid the security team at all

119
00:05:17,289 --> 00:05:19,449
costs and that they're really mean and

120
00:05:19,449 --> 00:05:24,310
they made me feel very bad and um fast

121
00:05:24,310 --> 00:05:27,069
forward many years and then I became a

122
00:05:27,069 --> 00:05:31,000
pen tester of web apps and a VA scanner

123
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:35,020
of networks and I learned that that

124
00:05:35,020 --> 00:05:37,960
person had no idea what any of those

125
00:05:37,960 --> 00:05:41,139
results meant he didn't know what the

126
00:05:41,139 --> 00:05:43,930
tool man and he was insecure and he felt

127
00:05:43,930 --> 00:05:47,379
vulnerable and he rather than owning it

128
00:05:47,379 --> 00:05:48,669
and saying I don't know what they mean

129
00:05:48,669 --> 00:05:51,370
either let's work on this he put all

130
00:05:51,370 --> 00:05:55,029
this insecurity onto me by shaming me

131
00:05:55,029 --> 00:05:57,370
and making me feel stupid instead of

132
00:05:57,370 --> 00:05:59,589
admitting that he didn't know either I'm

133
00:05:59,589 --> 00:06:02,009
working on it with me together and

134
00:06:02,009 --> 00:06:04,419
oldest brings me to the topic of this

135
00:06:04,419 --> 00:06:07,870
talk which is why can't we build secure

136
00:06:07,870 --> 00:06:11,349
software I feel there's like a lot of

137
00:06:11,349 --> 00:06:14,589
things at odds in a lot of companies and

138
00:06:14,589 --> 00:06:19,330
IT departments and usually I only talk

139
00:06:19,330 --> 00:06:21,520
about technical things and not soft

140
00:06:21,520 --> 00:06:25,289
skill sorts of things but spoiler alert

141
00:06:25,289 --> 00:06:29,310
some of it is because of communication

142
00:06:29,310 --> 00:06:35,339
so let's briefly discuss me and my

143
00:06:35,339 --> 00:06:37,690
qualifications this is a thing that a

144
00:06:37,690 --> 00:06:39,220
lot of us do

145
00:06:39,220 --> 00:06:42,490
and we do about me slides to tell you

146
00:06:42,490 --> 00:06:44,560
who we are in hopes that you feel gosh

147
00:06:44,560 --> 00:06:46,450
darnit show it's pretty qualified I'm

148
00:06:46,450 --> 00:06:47,950
gonna listen to what she says

149
00:06:47,950 --> 00:06:51,100
awesome so I'm Tania Gingka on the

150
00:06:51,100 --> 00:06:52,900
Internet I'm known as she hacks purple

151
00:06:52,900 --> 00:06:55,840
because I am a purple team err I like to

152
00:06:55,840 --> 00:06:59,140
break things and then defend them that

153
00:06:59,140 --> 00:07:01,840
interest me greatly um I work at a

154
00:07:01,840 --> 00:07:04,150
little startup you might have heard of

155
00:07:04,150 --> 00:07:09,190
us and I am the weirdest title ever I'm

156
00:07:09,190 --> 00:07:12,340
a cloud advocate I did not know what

157
00:07:12,340 --> 00:07:13,990
that meant either at first so I made a

158
00:07:13,990 --> 00:07:17,260
slide to explain what I do so basically

159
00:07:17,260 --> 00:07:18,730
I get to do a lot of really cool

160
00:07:18,730 --> 00:07:21,160
community work I get to get feedback

161
00:07:21,160 --> 00:07:23,410
from the community and then deliver it

162
00:07:23,410 --> 00:07:26,230
to like the product teams in a way that

163
00:07:26,230 --> 00:07:29,680
is palatable not this this security

164
00:07:29,680 --> 00:07:33,100
feature really sucks as opposed to this

165
00:07:33,100 --> 00:07:35,230
security features delivering a lot of

166
00:07:35,230 --> 00:07:37,750
false positives or it's slowing down the

167
00:07:37,750 --> 00:07:39,460
build to a point where it's completely

168
00:07:39,460 --> 00:07:42,160
unacceptable right I get to do security

169
00:07:42,160 --> 00:07:44,890
research or lease it to the community

170
00:07:44,890 --> 00:07:47,130
for free work on my open-source project

171
00:07:47,130 --> 00:07:50,260
and basically advocate on behalf of the

172
00:07:50,260 --> 00:07:52,480
community towards Microsoft if that

173
00:07:52,480 --> 00:07:54,820
makes any sense so if you have a

174
00:07:54,820 --> 00:07:57,430
specific problem with Azure security

175
00:07:57,430 --> 00:07:59,169
stuff you should probably tell me so I

176
00:07:59,169 --> 00:08:00,640
can try to actually get it fixed

177
00:08:00,640 --> 00:08:04,270
I am wildly obsessed with a wasp the

178
00:08:04,270 --> 00:08:05,980
open web application of the security

179
00:08:05,980 --> 00:08:09,640
project I joke that I was is my best

180
00:08:09,640 --> 00:08:14,320
friend forever we are a non-profit I

181
00:08:14,320 --> 00:08:16,240
volunteer for them I do not ever get

182
00:08:16,240 --> 00:08:18,160
paid there's projects and there's

183
00:08:18,160 --> 00:08:20,980
chapters and there's conferences and

184
00:08:20,980 --> 00:08:22,690
there's gonna be an amazing conference

185
00:08:22,690 --> 00:08:24,880
in Tel Aviv and May and I'm gonna be

186
00:08:24,880 --> 00:08:27,669
there and I'm wildly excited and all we

187
00:08:27,669 --> 00:08:29,169
do is try to help people make more

188
00:08:29,169 --> 00:08:31,900
secure software and I love os I'm gonna

189
00:08:31,900 --> 00:08:33,849
try to calm down not talk about them the

190
00:08:33,849 --> 00:08:37,210
whole time I have an OS project

191
00:08:37,210 --> 00:08:40,570
it's about dedsec ops so it's like dead

192
00:08:40,570 --> 00:08:43,510
slop sloppy dev ops that's us it's a

193
00:08:43,510 --> 00:08:45,610
group of friends and we just do nerdy

194
00:08:45,610 --> 00:08:49,420
stuff I am with a bunch of other really

195
00:08:49,420 --> 00:08:50,940
cool women I

196
00:08:50,940 --> 00:08:53,310
this thing called fists women and

197
00:08:53,310 --> 00:08:55,620
security in tech so if you are a woman

198
00:08:55,620 --> 00:08:57,540
and you want to meet other cool women

199
00:08:57,540 --> 00:08:59,610
that work in security and you might want

200
00:08:59,610 --> 00:09:01,710
to join us we are changing our name soon

201
00:09:01,710 --> 00:09:03,330
because it turns out that our names

202
00:09:03,330 --> 00:09:04,770
almost the same as another woman's group

203
00:09:04,770 --> 00:09:06,090
and it's very confusing for everyone

204
00:09:06,090 --> 00:09:08,430
have a really sorry so if you want to

205
00:09:08,430 --> 00:09:10,050
find us and we have a new name just

206
00:09:10,050 --> 00:09:11,430
message me and I'll tell you the new

207
00:09:11,430 --> 00:09:13,860
name sorry but we still want you to join

208
00:09:13,860 --> 00:09:18,270
okay I've been coding for a really long

209
00:09:18,270 --> 00:09:20,670
time whatever age you think I am you

210
00:09:20,670 --> 00:09:23,070
should add probably ten or more so that

211
00:09:23,070 --> 00:09:25,950
you get my real age yeah I started at

212
00:09:25,950 --> 00:09:28,080
Nortel which is like a used to be a

213
00:09:28,080 --> 00:09:31,650
giant security company in Canada in 1997

214
00:09:31,650 --> 00:09:34,140
so I've been in tech a long time being

215
00:09:34,140 --> 00:09:38,610
quite nerdy and I'm really really upset

216
00:09:38,610 --> 00:09:40,080
at how hard it is to make secure

217
00:09:40,080 --> 00:09:42,600
software so I've kind of decided to

218
00:09:42,600 --> 00:09:45,750
dedicate myself to it and now I'm also

219
00:09:45,750 --> 00:09:47,640
really excited about cloud security too

220
00:09:47,640 --> 00:09:50,160
but I just I feel scary it's too hard

221
00:09:50,160 --> 00:09:53,280
and that's part of why like sneak is

222
00:09:53,280 --> 00:09:56,340
doing this and so many other companies

223
00:09:56,340 --> 00:09:58,410
are doing so many community based things

224
00:09:58,410 --> 00:10:00,780
it's because like it needs to just be

225
00:10:00,780 --> 00:10:02,670
not impossible to make secure software

226
00:10:02,670 --> 00:10:04,170
so this is a thing that's really

227
00:10:04,170 --> 00:10:05,940
important to me so I really want to

228
00:10:05,940 --> 00:10:07,500
thank all of you for taking time out of

229
00:10:07,500 --> 00:10:09,780
your day to come see this and I really

230
00:10:09,780 --> 00:10:11,370
hope that some of my ideas are helpful

231
00:10:11,370 --> 00:10:14,550
to you okay now that is a lot about me

232
00:10:14,550 --> 00:10:19,410
I would like to instead talk about IT so

233
00:10:19,410 --> 00:10:21,570
it made me mess

234
00:10:21,570 --> 00:10:26,460
for this whole talk and part of this is

235
00:10:26,460 --> 00:10:28,440
hidden on my screen but hopefully it's

236
00:10:28,440 --> 00:10:30,870
not hidden on yours but the developers

237
00:10:30,870 --> 00:10:32,670
said they'd implement they wouldn't

238
00:10:32,670 --> 00:10:34,500
implement any of the security fixes and

239
00:10:34,500 --> 00:10:36,450
then Johnny Depp says they said they'll

240
00:10:36,450 --> 00:10:38,400
fix them in the next release and then

241
00:10:38,400 --> 00:10:40,860
they hug because they know it's probably

242
00:10:40,860 --> 00:10:43,980
not true so on this flight I want to

243
00:10:43,980 --> 00:10:47,250
talk about what do developers do that me

244
00:10:47,250 --> 00:10:53,190
security people feel insecure sometimes

245
00:10:53,190 --> 00:10:57,780
um so for instance I've worked out a lot

246
00:10:57,780 --> 00:10:59,670
of places where the developers don't ask

247
00:10:59,670 --> 00:11:01,560
the security teams at face when they

248
00:11:01,560 --> 00:11:03,690
totally should right like they're like

249
00:11:03,690 --> 00:11:05,100
oh we need to encrypt the

250
00:11:05,100 --> 00:11:07,860
we'll just write our own crypto we'll

251
00:11:07,860 --> 00:11:10,440
roll our own crypto solution like wolf

252
00:11:10,440 --> 00:11:12,900
Bay 64 encoded twice in a row no one

253
00:11:12,900 --> 00:11:15,330
will ever guess that it's like no that's

254
00:11:15,330 --> 00:11:20,040
not secure please and like it hurts my

255
00:11:20,040 --> 00:11:21,740
feelings if they don't ask me for

256
00:11:21,740 --> 00:11:24,540
security advice when they should write

257
00:11:24,540 --> 00:11:26,100
like it's like that's literally my job

258
00:11:26,100 --> 00:11:29,280
to help you with this um you know when

259
00:11:29,280 --> 00:11:31,230
developers receive the security report

260
00:11:31,230 --> 00:11:33,570
and they don't fix anything I was

261
00:11:33,570 --> 00:11:36,810
telling the people at SDC this morning I

262
00:11:36,810 --> 00:11:39,420
used to work somewhere and I kid you not

263
00:11:39,420 --> 00:11:42,030
on the wiki for the developers it said

264
00:11:42,030 --> 00:11:43,770
to ignore everything but the security

265
00:11:43,770 --> 00:11:45,540
team sent them and just dismissed the

266
00:11:45,540 --> 00:11:46,890
reports because they're usually false

267
00:11:46,890 --> 00:11:48,360
positives and a complete waste of time

268
00:11:48,360 --> 00:11:52,290
like on their official work wiki I I

269
00:11:52,290 --> 00:11:53,760
don't know how hard to tell you how

270
00:11:53,760 --> 00:11:55,350
heartbreaking that is is like to

271
00:11:55,350 --> 00:11:57,390
actually completely dismiss all the work

272
00:11:57,390 --> 00:12:00,060
that my team did because I was

273
00:12:00,060 --> 00:12:04,080
flabbergasted um sometimes they don't

274
00:12:04,080 --> 00:12:06,180
fix anything and tell us you know they

275
00:12:06,180 --> 00:12:08,880
have more important things to do making

276
00:12:08,880 --> 00:12:10,980
us feel a bit like chopped liver or like

277
00:12:10,980 --> 00:12:12,660
they don't understand the risks involved

278
00:12:12,660 --> 00:12:15,510
or like that we've told them it's

279
00:12:15,510 --> 00:12:18,480
important and they're not valuing that

280
00:12:18,480 --> 00:12:21,120
um sometimes they don't cooperate with

281
00:12:21,120 --> 00:12:22,740
the security team claiming they have no

282
00:12:22,740 --> 00:12:26,540
time or a Security's little priority and

283
00:12:26,540 --> 00:12:28,710
yeah I just want to go back one more

284
00:12:28,710 --> 00:12:30,780
time just not asking or taking advice

285
00:12:30,780 --> 00:12:32,490
from the security team when it's really

286
00:12:32,490 --> 00:12:35,280
well-meaning that's it definitely makes

287
00:12:35,280 --> 00:12:37,020
me feel the like chopped liver I don't

288
00:12:37,020 --> 00:12:38,250
know if you have that expression and

289
00:12:38,250 --> 00:12:39,690
where you live but chopped liver means

290
00:12:39,690 --> 00:12:44,070
really not important okay so developer

291
00:12:44,070 --> 00:12:47,070
and then after the security report so

292
00:12:47,070 --> 00:12:48,510
let's look at the other side of that so

293
00:12:48,510 --> 00:12:52,050
what does the security team - that is

294
00:12:52,050 --> 00:12:54,900
really the opposite of enabling the

295
00:12:54,900 --> 00:12:58,730
developers or not flattering or helpful

296
00:12:58,730 --> 00:13:03,600
so some things I've seen teams do is

297
00:13:03,600 --> 00:13:06,900
they just send them a link so I work

298
00:13:06,900 --> 00:13:08,460
somewhere once and they were just

299
00:13:08,460 --> 00:13:11,880
emailing reports directly from AppScan

300
00:13:11,880 --> 00:13:14,370
to the developers without validating any

301
00:13:14,370 --> 00:13:16,270
of the results

302
00:13:16,270 --> 00:13:18,279
and that resulted in a lot of false

303
00:13:18,279 --> 00:13:20,350
positives wasting so much time for the

304
00:13:20,350 --> 00:13:22,959
developers I mean if it's not important

305
00:13:22,959 --> 00:13:25,029
enough for us to read it's definitely

306
00:13:25,029 --> 00:13:26,740
how is it important enough for them to

307
00:13:26,740 --> 00:13:29,649
read write or um the security team

308
00:13:29,649 --> 00:13:32,410
saying you know here's like 20 security

309
00:13:32,410 --> 00:13:34,420
requirements they expect you to do from

310
00:13:34,420 --> 00:13:34,779
now on

311
00:13:34,779 --> 00:13:38,260
and then the developers say why and then

312
00:13:38,260 --> 00:13:41,080
they say because security and whenever

313
00:13:41,080 --> 00:13:43,510
someone says that's you like that is not

314
00:13:43,510 --> 00:13:45,930
a good sign

315
00:13:46,560 --> 00:13:49,570
there's I've also seen you know

316
00:13:49,570 --> 00:13:52,270
developers ask earnestly for advice you

317
00:13:52,270 --> 00:13:55,690
know we're designing an API do you have

318
00:13:55,690 --> 00:13:57,220
a list of best practices we could follow

319
00:13:57,220 --> 00:13:59,800
or could you give us advice to make sure

320
00:13:59,800 --> 00:14:03,010
API is secure you know we're just doing

321
00:14:03,010 --> 00:14:05,380
the design now and we'd really like your

322
00:14:05,380 --> 00:14:06,910
advice and then the security team says

323
00:14:06,910 --> 00:14:09,730
it sends a link to NIST and says read

324
00:14:09,730 --> 00:14:15,220
this or I TSG or gdpr

325
00:14:15,220 --> 00:14:18,130
or some other huge long policy and it's

326
00:14:18,130 --> 00:14:20,860
like that's not advice right like unless

327
00:14:20,860 --> 00:14:23,589
someone has you know unless someone is

328
00:14:23,589 --> 00:14:28,209
into policy and you know I really value

329
00:14:28,209 --> 00:14:29,890
those people because I cannot possibly

330
00:14:29,890 --> 00:14:32,200
read something like that but like you're

331
00:14:32,200 --> 00:14:34,600
giving someone really unhelpful advice

332
00:14:34,600 --> 00:14:37,240
right like they want you to come and

333
00:14:37,240 --> 00:14:38,920
talk to them about best practices for

334
00:14:38,920 --> 00:14:41,560
API is not like a link to like

335
00:14:41,560 --> 00:14:45,029
high-level things that aren't specific

336
00:14:45,029 --> 00:14:48,959
the last thing I want to say is that

337
00:14:48,959 --> 00:14:51,700
like we saw on the first slide the

338
00:14:51,700 --> 00:14:53,829
security person making me feel really

339
00:14:53,829 --> 00:14:56,290
unconfident I've been putting me down

340
00:14:56,290 --> 00:14:58,120
when they gave me my results that is a

341
00:14:58,120 --> 00:15:00,579
big problem I have met a lot of red

342
00:15:00,579 --> 00:15:04,560
teamers who aren't delicate when they

343
00:15:04,560 --> 00:15:08,890
deliver their results I met two guys

344
00:15:08,890 --> 00:15:11,649
once that were in security and they were

345
00:15:11,649 --> 00:15:13,089
making like these weird faces at each

346
00:15:13,089 --> 00:15:14,459
other in the hallway

347
00:15:14,459 --> 00:15:17,350
and they always contracted to work with

348
00:15:17,350 --> 00:15:19,420
them very briefly and they were making

349
00:15:19,420 --> 00:15:21,399
these silly faces at each other and like

350
00:15:21,399 --> 00:15:22,720
what are you doing like we're making

351
00:15:22,720 --> 00:15:24,640
we're practicing our faces so that when

352
00:15:24,640 --> 00:15:26,980
developers ask questions they can know

353
00:15:26,980 --> 00:15:28,670
how stupid they are

354
00:15:28,670 --> 00:15:30,470
and so they know that they should never

355
00:15:30,470 --> 00:15:32,720
ask us for help again because they

356
00:15:32,720 --> 00:15:34,850
should know better and I was

357
00:15:34,850 --> 00:15:36,820
flabbergasted and like just for post

358
00:15:36,820 --> 00:15:39,140
like I might gets literally your job to

359
00:15:39,140 --> 00:15:40,250
help them they're like if people are

360
00:15:40,250 --> 00:15:42,140
gonna ask basic questions we don't have

361
00:15:42,140 --> 00:15:44,780
time for that and I was just say so

362
00:15:44,780 --> 00:15:48,530
upset but I also felt like job security

363
00:15:48,530 --> 00:15:50,810
because I try really hard not to be mean

364
00:15:50,810 --> 00:15:53,120
to people and sadly that is a

365
00:15:53,120 --> 00:15:55,040
qualification that puts me ahead of some

366
00:15:55,040 --> 00:15:57,200
people and the security industry some

367
00:15:57,200 --> 00:15:58,490
people

368
00:15:58,490 --> 00:16:00,860
yeah just make developers feel really

369
00:16:00,860 --> 00:16:02,690
bad when it's completely unnecessary so

370
00:16:02,690 --> 00:16:04,220
I know I talked a lot on these two

371
00:16:04,220 --> 00:16:07,490
slides but I feel that this is a really

372
00:16:07,490 --> 00:16:10,910
big part of the problem all of these

373
00:16:10,910 --> 00:16:13,160
types of frictions between the two teams

374
00:16:13,160 --> 00:16:15,560
which I have seen at every single place

375
00:16:15,560 --> 00:16:18,170
I've worked and heard that like when I

376
00:16:18,170 --> 00:16:21,320
started speaking at conferences I'm

377
00:16:21,320 --> 00:16:23,480
lucky enough to meet lots of other

378
00:16:23,480 --> 00:16:26,990
amazing people within the information

379
00:16:26,990 --> 00:16:29,960
security community and industry and so I

380
00:16:29,960 --> 00:16:32,840
started asking every person about things

381
00:16:32,840 --> 00:16:34,280
like this and there were just endless

382
00:16:34,280 --> 00:16:37,850
stories that astounded me of things like

383
00:16:37,850 --> 00:16:40,730
failures on both sides and I won't go

384
00:16:40,730 --> 00:16:42,770
into details about too many of them

385
00:16:42,770 --> 00:16:44,240
because I don't want to identify anyone

386
00:16:44,240 --> 00:16:46,940
but just things that were way worse than

387
00:16:46,940 --> 00:16:49,250
any of the examples I just gave you and

388
00:16:49,250 --> 00:16:52,610
all of these these things create the

389
00:16:52,610 --> 00:16:54,380
feeling of insecurity about how people

390
00:16:54,380 --> 00:16:56,300
do their jobs and how well they do them

391
00:16:56,300 --> 00:16:58,250
and so I was like I know what I'll do

392
00:16:58,250 --> 00:17:00,770
I'll research job insecurity and see

393
00:17:00,770 --> 00:17:02,770
what the results are well it turns out

394
00:17:02,770 --> 00:17:07,910
there are lots of amazing so I I work in

395
00:17:07,910 --> 00:17:10,220
him InfoSec an IT that is the thing that

396
00:17:10,220 --> 00:17:12,410
I'm good at I'm also sort of good at

397
00:17:12,410 --> 00:17:15,140
gardening and like I can play guitar but

398
00:17:15,140 --> 00:17:16,790
like I don't claim to be good at

399
00:17:16,790 --> 00:17:19,819
anything to do with psychology so I

400
00:17:19,819 --> 00:17:22,760
looked up what experts did I don't know

401
00:17:22,760 --> 00:17:24,440
if any of you have heard of dr. Jessica

402
00:17:24,440 --> 00:17:26,180
Parker but she's like out of this world

403
00:17:26,180 --> 00:17:30,050
awesome and yeah her works really great

404
00:17:30,050 --> 00:17:32,450
on this topic in case you want more

405
00:17:32,450 --> 00:17:35,930
information but basically in security

406
00:17:35,930 --> 00:17:38,120
and people about how they do their jobs

407
00:17:38,120 --> 00:17:40,520
leads to predictably negative behavior

408
00:17:40,520 --> 00:17:41,870
so there were so many stuff

409
00:17:41,870 --> 00:17:43,610
that I feel that I can just say

410
00:17:43,610 --> 00:17:45,980
definitively um that these are the

411
00:17:45,980 --> 00:17:48,620
things right so we have these two teams

412
00:17:48,620 --> 00:17:50,000
they're conflicting with each other

413
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:52,430
there's so much friction some people

414
00:17:52,430 --> 00:17:55,040
will start to feel like like I did when

415
00:17:55,040 --> 00:17:56,900
that person from the security team

416
00:17:56,900 --> 00:17:58,430
basically told me I was an awful

417
00:17:58,430 --> 00:18:00,200
software developer and I should never

418
00:18:00,200 --> 00:18:02,120
have ever had any security bugs in my

419
00:18:02,120 --> 00:18:04,970
code etcetera etc like it made me feel

420
00:18:04,970 --> 00:18:07,070
really insecure and quite frankly like

421
00:18:07,070 --> 00:18:11,000
Shane's so that can lead to predictable

422
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:16,580
behavior which is deviant behavior so if

423
00:18:16,580 --> 00:18:18,230
you've created a bunch of policies and

424
00:18:18,230 --> 00:18:20,660
guidelines and then people are actively

425
00:18:20,660 --> 00:18:23,240
deviating from them that's not ideal

426
00:18:23,240 --> 00:18:27,110
right moral disengagement you don't

427
00:18:27,110 --> 00:18:29,059
really want something being in charge of

428
00:18:29,059 --> 00:18:31,690
the secrets for your organization if

429
00:18:31,690 --> 00:18:35,030
their morality has become flexible due

430
00:18:35,030 --> 00:18:38,420
to these sorts of feelings reduce job

431
00:18:38,420 --> 00:18:41,630
involvement so someone who's feeling all

432
00:18:41,630 --> 00:18:44,240
of these feelings is unlikely to go the

433
00:18:44,240 --> 00:18:46,880
extra mile in regards to you know I'm

434
00:18:46,880 --> 00:18:48,230
gonna stay really late and fix that

435
00:18:48,230 --> 00:18:50,420
security bug or I'm gonna run these

436
00:18:50,420 --> 00:18:52,450
security tests for like the fourth time

437
00:18:52,450 --> 00:18:54,679
because I need to see you know

438
00:18:54,679 --> 00:18:58,520
regression testing on this risk-taking

439
00:18:58,520 --> 00:19:00,740
behavior so I because I'm speaking to

440
00:19:00,740 --> 00:19:02,600
lots of people that work in IT and

441
00:19:02,600 --> 00:19:03,950
probably lots of people that work at

442
00:19:03,950 --> 00:19:05,600
risk I feel like it's pretty obvious

443
00:19:05,600 --> 00:19:09,070
risk-taking behavior is not ideal

444
00:19:09,070 --> 00:19:12,020
reduction of organizational citizenship

445
00:19:12,020 --> 00:19:15,200
behavior I'm gonna explain this one so

446
00:19:15,200 --> 00:19:17,510
in layman's terms it means positive

447
00:19:17,510 --> 00:19:21,429
workplace activity and involvement

448
00:19:21,940 --> 00:19:24,440
imagine you are in the kitchen where you

449
00:19:24,440 --> 00:19:27,770
work and you pour some coffee I need to

450
00:19:27,770 --> 00:19:30,470
fill some coffee on the counter so if

451
00:19:30,470 --> 00:19:32,960
someone has excellent organizational

452
00:19:32,960 --> 00:19:35,120
citizenship behavior so if you're really

453
00:19:35,120 --> 00:19:37,940
happy at the place you work you will

454
00:19:37,940 --> 00:19:39,860
definitely clean that up even if no

455
00:19:39,860 --> 00:19:42,200
one's watching right so you've seen no

456
00:19:42,200 --> 00:19:43,520
one's watching you've spilled the coffee

457
00:19:43,520 --> 00:19:47,090
you will grab a paper towel or you know

458
00:19:47,090 --> 00:19:49,940
a cloth towel and you will wipe it up

459
00:19:49,940 --> 00:19:52,970
and if you really feel very positive and

460
00:19:52,970 --> 00:19:54,260
you feel ownership

461
00:19:54,260 --> 00:19:56,510
and you feel included and happy where

462
00:19:56,510 --> 00:19:58,370
you work it's very possible you might

463
00:19:58,370 --> 00:20:00,320
actually just take the time to wipe down

464
00:20:00,320 --> 00:20:01,940
the whole counter while you're at it

465
00:20:01,940 --> 00:20:04,880
right well the opposite of this a

466
00:20:04,880 --> 00:20:07,310
reduction of this type of behavior that

467
00:20:07,310 --> 00:20:10,130
person will intend oh they spilled the

468
00:20:10,130 --> 00:20:12,430
coffee and they'll be like you know what

469
00:20:12,430 --> 00:20:16,160
screw those other guys I'm not cleaning

470
00:20:16,160 --> 00:20:18,050
this this isn't even my kitchen and I

471
00:20:18,050 --> 00:20:19,940
don't even like this place and they will

472
00:20:19,940 --> 00:20:21,680
leave it on purpose and that's the type

473
00:20:21,680 --> 00:20:23,900
of person you can definitely count on to

474
00:20:23,900 --> 00:20:25,750
do things like hard kodi neeya of

475
00:20:25,750 --> 00:20:29,870
credentials were you know skipping Oh

476
00:20:29,870 --> 00:20:33,470
like I worked with someone briefly when

477
00:20:33,470 --> 00:20:35,180
I first started who would just dismiss

478
00:20:35,180 --> 00:20:37,940
tons of security results and a scanners

479
00:20:37,940 --> 00:20:41,210
because they rarely were a thing and

480
00:20:41,210 --> 00:20:43,220
you're just like just elite all of them

481
00:20:43,220 --> 00:20:45,470
yeah don't bother checking I'm like but

482
00:20:45,470 --> 00:20:46,520
that looks really bad

483
00:20:46,520 --> 00:20:49,160
don't bother it's usually nothing I'm

484
00:20:49,160 --> 00:20:52,900
like but but but those people are not

485
00:20:52,900 --> 00:20:57,200
going to they don't feel ownership and a

486
00:20:57,200 --> 00:20:58,880
place that they work right they don't

487
00:20:58,880 --> 00:21:01,340
feel the loyalty and this is very

488
00:21:01,340 --> 00:21:04,520
dangerous if these are the persons that

489
00:21:04,520 --> 00:21:06,020
are in charge of like ensuring your

490
00:21:06,020 --> 00:21:09,920
software is secure so all of this

491
00:21:09,920 --> 00:21:12,880
negative behavior like deviant behavior

492
00:21:12,880 --> 00:21:16,100
moral disengagement all of these things

493
00:21:16,100 --> 00:21:19,340
lead to negative behavior that results

494
00:21:19,340 --> 00:21:21,650
in and secure software right if people

495
00:21:21,650 --> 00:21:23,570
don't care about keeping the secrets

496
00:21:23,570 --> 00:21:25,460
that people are unmotivated people feel

497
00:21:25,460 --> 00:21:27,290
kind of angry against their workplace or

498
00:21:27,290 --> 00:21:30,560
the other team it is my hypothesis in

499
00:21:30,560 --> 00:21:33,680
this talk that that is not the only

500
00:21:33,680 --> 00:21:35,540
reason for insecure software but there

501
00:21:35,540 --> 00:21:37,850
is a big part of insecure software in

502
00:21:37,850 --> 00:21:41,660
many many many places that many people I

503
00:21:41,660 --> 00:21:46,670
know have worked and I have done several

504
00:21:46,670 --> 00:21:48,590
things over the past five years in my

505
00:21:48,590 --> 00:21:50,630
career and before that even when I was a

506
00:21:50,630 --> 00:21:52,640
software developer and I became kind of

507
00:21:52,640 --> 00:21:55,190
a secure coding champion because I was

508
00:21:55,190 --> 00:21:57,740
really excited about security and that

509
00:21:57,740 --> 00:21:59,360
many other people I know that work in

510
00:21:59,360 --> 00:22:00,890
this industry have tried and that have

511
00:22:00,890 --> 00:22:04,850
worked to improve this so this is my

512
00:22:04,850 --> 00:22:07,550
hypothesis and quite a lot of people

513
00:22:07,550 --> 00:22:10,010
seem to agree with it and you still hold

514
00:22:10,010 --> 00:22:11,630
like open discussions during this talk

515
00:22:11,630 --> 00:22:13,130
about this but everyone was just like we

516
00:22:13,130 --> 00:22:13,490
agreed

517
00:22:13,490 --> 00:22:15,590
tell us the answer so I'm just gonna

518
00:22:15,590 --> 00:22:18,140
continue and assume hopefully that you

519
00:22:18,140 --> 00:22:20,030
agree at this hypothesis that this is

520
00:22:20,030 --> 00:22:21,980
part of the reason why we have insecure

521
00:22:21,980 --> 00:22:25,100
software right now is at many many

522
00:22:25,100 --> 00:22:28,610
workplaces these things are true so now

523
00:22:28,610 --> 00:22:30,890
let's just look at solutions I honestly

524
00:22:30,890 --> 00:22:33,290
really believe that if anyone's gonna

525
00:22:33,290 --> 00:22:35,300
produce a talk that is really important

526
00:22:35,300 --> 00:22:37,490
that we provide solutions I've seen a

527
00:22:37,490 --> 00:22:38,990
lot of talks where they're just like so

528
00:22:38,990 --> 00:22:42,680
we have all these problems tough or they

529
00:22:42,680 --> 00:22:44,870
offer like really high high-level

530
00:22:44,870 --> 00:22:46,340
solutions that aren't actually

531
00:22:46,340 --> 00:22:48,560
actionable there aren't actually

532
00:22:48,560 --> 00:22:50,600
specific they aren't like we should just

533
00:22:50,600 --> 00:22:52,760
work hard or double down like to me that

534
00:22:52,760 --> 00:22:54,950
that's useless so I'm gonna try to give

535
00:22:54,950 --> 00:22:57,320
you actionable things that you can do

536
00:22:57,320 --> 00:23:00,680
and if people have ideas that have

537
00:23:00,680 --> 00:23:02,990
worked at where they work or somewhere

538
00:23:02,990 --> 00:23:05,030
else like if you want to ask questions

539
00:23:05,030 --> 00:23:06,290
in the end and add to this I would

540
00:23:06,290 --> 00:23:08,420
absolutely love to hear your ideas

541
00:23:08,420 --> 00:23:11,750
because so many audiences have so many

542
00:23:11,750 --> 00:23:13,430
awesome ideas ok so let's talk about

543
00:23:13,430 --> 00:23:17,030
solutions Leo and I are ready so here's

544
00:23:17,030 --> 00:23:19,430
the plan there's a three point plan and

545
00:23:19,430 --> 00:23:21,440
then there's several ideas within this

546
00:23:21,440 --> 00:23:25,520
plan or it's a two point plan so I know

547
00:23:25,520 --> 00:23:26,870
the first thing you're gonna do is read

548
00:23:26,870 --> 00:23:28,550
the whole thing of what it says but I'm

549
00:23:28,550 --> 00:23:31,090
gonna read it with you and hopefully

550
00:23:31,090 --> 00:23:33,950
then we are gonna dissect this with

551
00:23:33,950 --> 00:23:36,130
several like specific actionable ideas

552
00:23:36,130 --> 00:23:37,970
and then we're going to summarize this

553
00:23:37,970 --> 00:23:39,350
again at the end because I really really

554
00:23:39,350 --> 00:23:41,600
want you to remember it and then I'm

555
00:23:41,600 --> 00:23:42,950
going to give you some resources of

556
00:23:42,950 --> 00:23:44,300
things that you can do to start

557
00:23:44,300 --> 00:23:47,480
immediately on some of these things if

558
00:23:47,480 --> 00:23:51,050
you find some of these ideas good okay

559
00:23:51,050 --> 00:23:55,700
so the plan so planned support the dev

560
00:23:55,700 --> 00:23:58,400
team and the security team and all of IT

561
00:23:58,400 --> 00:24:01,210
while you're at it with processes

562
00:24:01,210 --> 00:24:04,580
training and resources so that they

563
00:24:04,580 --> 00:24:06,560
confidently get their job done they have

564
00:24:06,560 --> 00:24:07,850
all the things that they need to know

565
00:24:07,850 --> 00:24:10,550
and have and processes that actually

566
00:24:10,550 --> 00:24:13,280
work so they can get the job done and

567
00:24:13,280 --> 00:24:15,380
feel awesome and create awesome stuff

568
00:24:15,380 --> 00:24:17,780
and then the last thing is we need to

569
00:24:17,780 --> 00:24:19,820
initiate and then maintain a culture

570
00:24:19,820 --> 00:24:21,110
change that this is the way

571
00:24:21,110 --> 00:24:23,780
we do things so let's look into this

572
00:24:23,780 --> 00:24:26,080
closer so let's talk about processes

573
00:24:26,080 --> 00:24:29,960
because the processes are too high

574
00:24:29,960 --> 00:24:33,530
I worked somewhere once where it took a

575
00:24:33,530 --> 00:24:36,410
minimum three weeks to get one scan

576
00:24:36,410 --> 00:24:38,360
approved like a simple scan I'm not

577
00:24:38,360 --> 00:24:41,000
talking about a penetration test I mean

578
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:42,380
like just running a scan that I'd

579
00:24:42,380 --> 00:24:45,710
already run before and there were 21

580
00:24:45,710 --> 00:24:50,210
approval steps and four levels above me

581
00:24:50,210 --> 00:24:53,840
had to approve it and I don't know how

582
00:24:53,840 --> 00:24:56,840
to express to you what a insane waste of

583
00:24:56,840 --> 00:25:00,880
time that was not like obviously I feel

584
00:25:00,880 --> 00:25:03,500
my needs are important so I thought they

585
00:25:03,500 --> 00:25:06,110
was waste of time for me but it's a

586
00:25:06,110 --> 00:25:08,169
super waste of time for the client

587
00:25:08,169 --> 00:25:10,580
because it didn't actually build value

588
00:25:10,580 --> 00:25:12,650
so having someone that's four levels

589
00:25:12,650 --> 00:25:14,809
above me so that person did not know who

590
00:25:14,809 --> 00:25:17,330
I was or even what my job meant or what

591
00:25:17,330 --> 00:25:20,150
a scan means or like what I could

592
00:25:20,150 --> 00:25:22,610
potentially break or how to perhaps

593
00:25:22,610 --> 00:25:24,320
mitigate some of the risks of doing a

594
00:25:24,320 --> 00:25:25,910
scan like that person has no idea we are

595
00:25:25,910 --> 00:25:27,530
wasting that person's time and that

596
00:25:27,530 --> 00:25:29,390
person giving us approval is not

597
00:25:29,390 --> 00:25:32,000
actually adding any value right and then

598
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:34,790
the 21 different steps for approval all

599
00:25:34,790 --> 00:25:36,200
the people that were part of the

600
00:25:36,200 --> 00:25:38,630
approval process like only one of them

601
00:25:38,630 --> 00:25:41,179
actually like a really super mattered

602
00:25:41,179 --> 00:25:43,010
what they thought again like we should

603
00:25:43,010 --> 00:25:44,960
talk to the DBA and we should talk to

604
00:25:44,960 --> 00:25:46,970
the product owner and just be like yo

605
00:25:46,970 --> 00:25:48,559
we're gonna do this on Fridays now and

606
00:25:48,559 --> 00:25:50,000
we're gonna automate it at you know for

607
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:53,290
four in the morning or or whatever it is

608
00:25:53,290 --> 00:25:55,970
and we had to do this every time which

609
00:25:55,970 --> 00:26:00,169
was just wildly wasteful and so I want

610
00:26:00,169 --> 00:26:01,640
to talk about processes does that work

611
00:26:01,640 --> 00:26:03,559
because when we make processes that

612
00:26:03,559 --> 00:26:05,210
don't work that are inefficient it's

613
00:26:05,210 --> 00:26:08,780
very very discouraging and and also it's

614
00:26:08,780 --> 00:26:10,580
wasteful right and we want to use our

615
00:26:10,580 --> 00:26:12,260
awesome resources for the best weekend

616
00:26:12,260 --> 00:26:14,890
so I want to talk about things that work

617
00:26:14,890 --> 00:26:18,290
so first of all the very first process

618
00:26:18,290 --> 00:26:20,179
that I would like every single place to

619
00:26:20,179 --> 00:26:23,059
go is have an application security team

620
00:26:23,059 --> 00:26:27,169
or an app SEC team for short um if you

621
00:26:27,169 --> 00:26:30,620
work in an enterprise a big company you

622
00:26:30,620 --> 00:26:32,240
absolutely need to have an application

623
00:26:32,240 --> 00:26:34,140
security team

624
00:26:34,140 --> 00:26:36,750
that is a part of the security team that

625
00:26:36,750 --> 00:26:38,880
knows how to build secure software right

626
00:26:38,880 --> 00:26:41,899
so it's a nerd like me that knows about

627
00:26:41,899 --> 00:26:44,429
software but also knows about security

628
00:26:44,429 --> 00:26:47,909
and that person needs to help all the

629
00:26:47,909 --> 00:26:49,799
developers and enable them to create

630
00:26:49,799 --> 00:26:51,630
secure code whether it be you know

631
00:26:51,630 --> 00:26:56,100
reviewing their designs for security

632
00:26:56,100 --> 00:26:58,289
concepts like secure design concepts to

633
00:26:58,289 --> 00:27:00,779
making sure they're there or doing

634
00:27:00,779 --> 00:27:03,450
threat modeling with them or hacking

635
00:27:03,450 --> 00:27:06,690
their apps or giving them lessons if you

636
00:27:06,690 --> 00:27:10,049
have offered no support to any of your

637
00:27:10,049 --> 00:27:11,610
developers and regards to security if

638
00:27:11,610 --> 00:27:13,519
you haven't formalized any sort of role

639
00:27:13,519 --> 00:27:15,840
unless you're a startup or a very small

640
00:27:15,840 --> 00:27:17,460
company you know if you have an IT

641
00:27:17,460 --> 00:27:19,409
department of two people clearly you're

642
00:27:19,409 --> 00:27:21,750
not going to accept team but if you have

643
00:27:21,750 --> 00:27:23,399
an IT department of four hundred people

644
00:27:23,399 --> 00:27:25,529
and you don't have one person assigned

645
00:27:25,529 --> 00:27:27,870
to this like that's pretty disconcerting

646
00:27:27,870 --> 00:27:31,110
if anyone you know needs some sleep and

647
00:27:31,110 --> 00:27:33,149
you want to read the Verizon breach

648
00:27:33,149 --> 00:27:36,720
report I actually love it actually loved

649
00:27:36,720 --> 00:27:38,639
it I read it every year and it's

650
00:27:38,639 --> 00:27:41,490
actually awesome but in the past three

651
00:27:41,490 --> 00:27:42,090
years

652
00:27:42,090 --> 00:27:45,659
poor apps act like insecurities and apps

653
00:27:45,659 --> 00:27:48,330
has been the reason for all like the top

654
00:27:48,330 --> 00:27:50,360
number top reason of data breaches

655
00:27:50,360 --> 00:27:53,419
across the whole industry by a landslide

656
00:27:53,419 --> 00:27:57,899
every year for three years and it really

657
00:27:57,899 --> 00:27:59,549
needs to be prioritized so if you have

658
00:27:59,549 --> 00:28:01,889
like 20 people on your security team at

659
00:28:01,889 --> 00:28:03,480
least one of them should not have sec if

660
00:28:03,480 --> 00:28:04,080
not more

661
00:28:04,080 --> 00:28:06,779
okay so you've hired a knapsack team now

662
00:28:06,779 --> 00:28:12,080
next I couldn't help having a matrix

663
00:28:12,080 --> 00:28:16,889
joke so I used to work somewhere and we

664
00:28:16,889 --> 00:28:20,100
would matrix a security person into

665
00:28:20,100 --> 00:28:22,409
every new giant software development

666
00:28:22,409 --> 00:28:25,080
project at Netflix and a lot of other

667
00:28:25,080 --> 00:28:26,700
companies they called us the partnership

668
00:28:26,700 --> 00:28:28,230
model and it means you're assigning this

669
00:28:28,230 --> 00:28:32,039
one person to the project team and that

670
00:28:32,039 --> 00:28:35,220
person is their person on the security

671
00:28:35,220 --> 00:28:36,600
team so no matter what they need to know

672
00:28:36,600 --> 00:28:38,159
about security this person will go and

673
00:28:38,159 --> 00:28:39,779
find the answer for them and they follow

674
00:28:39,779 --> 00:28:41,100
them through the whole life of the

675
00:28:41,100 --> 00:28:41,880
project

676
00:28:41,880 --> 00:28:43,919
meaning you know at the kickoff meeting

677
00:28:43,919 --> 00:28:46,320
they're there they check the require

678
00:28:46,320 --> 00:28:48,630
like during the design you brainstorm

679
00:28:48,630 --> 00:28:50,880
with them you talk with them and this is

680
00:28:50,880 --> 00:28:54,690
a resource that's available to you I the

681
00:28:54,690 --> 00:28:56,750
first time I did this was I think in

682
00:28:56,750 --> 00:29:00,240
2015 and I met my person who was named

683
00:29:00,240 --> 00:29:02,490
Alicia and I still know her and she is

684
00:29:02,490 --> 00:29:06,570
such a badass she bought me a book by

685
00:29:06,570 --> 00:29:08,639
Microsoft called the secure systems

686
00:29:08,639 --> 00:29:11,309
about my life cycle and if she didn't

687
00:29:11,309 --> 00:29:14,759
know the answer she would admit it and

688
00:29:14,759 --> 00:29:16,740
then go help me find the answer or go

689
00:29:16,740 --> 00:29:18,870
say I don't know yes you gotta go use

690
00:29:18,870 --> 00:29:22,559
some Google right and I should push me

691
00:29:22,559 --> 00:29:25,110
in a positive way to make sure like we

692
00:29:25,110 --> 00:29:27,690
found the secure ways to do things and I

693
00:29:27,690 --> 00:29:29,610
found her to be incredibly reasonable

694
00:29:29,610 --> 00:29:32,100
which is like a really good quality and

695
00:29:32,100 --> 00:29:34,740
a security person and I still know her

696
00:29:34,740 --> 00:29:38,309
and still admire her and she also got me

697
00:29:38,309 --> 00:29:39,750
more interested in security and she

698
00:29:39,750 --> 00:29:41,899
ended up introducing me it's my first

699
00:29:41,899 --> 00:29:45,720
mentor in security so like a lot of

700
00:29:45,720 --> 00:29:47,039
awesome things can happen from this

701
00:29:47,039 --> 00:29:48,240
other than that I'm just making sure

702
00:29:48,240 --> 00:29:50,340
your projects more secure but anyway

703
00:29:50,340 --> 00:29:52,769
I've talked enough on this slide okay so

704
00:29:52,769 --> 00:29:55,769
next we definitely want to start at

705
00:29:55,769 --> 00:29:57,750
security earlier which some people call

706
00:29:57,750 --> 00:30:01,440
pushing left or shifting left so we need

707
00:30:01,440 --> 00:30:03,990
to formalize steps within the system

708
00:30:03,990 --> 00:30:06,480
development lifecycle to make sure that

709
00:30:06,480 --> 00:30:08,750
there's actually time to do the security

710
00:30:08,750 --> 00:30:11,250
activities so I've worked at places

711
00:30:11,250 --> 00:30:13,019
where they're like why didn't you ever

712
00:30:13,019 --> 00:30:14,730
do a secure code review like why don't

713
00:30:14,730 --> 00:30:16,769
you add security requirements but then

714
00:30:16,769 --> 00:30:18,210
when we look at the project schedule

715
00:30:18,210 --> 00:30:20,340
there is absolutely zero time allotted

716
00:30:20,340 --> 00:30:22,350
to any of those activities and then they

717
00:30:22,350 --> 00:30:24,570
tried to pile it on top and then they're

718
00:30:24,570 --> 00:30:26,340
like why isn't the app released on time

719
00:30:26,340 --> 00:30:30,690
it's like this is not fair so we need to

720
00:30:30,690 --> 00:30:32,370
formalize steps within the system

721
00:30:32,370 --> 00:30:33,960
development lifecycle and I realize that

722
00:30:33,960 --> 00:30:36,240
this is a beautiful waterfall that you

723
00:30:36,240 --> 00:30:38,429
are seeing in front of you but no matter

724
00:30:38,429 --> 00:30:40,340
what system development lifecycle

725
00:30:40,340 --> 00:30:42,870
paradigm you're using you still need

726
00:30:42,870 --> 00:30:44,340
requirements like even if you're doing

727
00:30:44,340 --> 00:30:45,570
agile and you're doing these tiny

728
00:30:45,570 --> 00:30:46,980
circles like you're still gathering

729
00:30:46,980 --> 00:30:49,049
Firemint and you should still have a

730
00:30:49,049 --> 00:30:50,940
quick talk with a security person to see

731
00:30:50,940 --> 00:30:55,110
if they need any um pushing left is my

732
00:30:55,110 --> 00:30:57,269
favorite thing if you want to talk about

733
00:30:57,269 --> 00:30:59,730
it sometime let me know ok so another

734
00:30:59,730 --> 00:31:01,710
thing we can do is we could be a lot

735
00:31:01,710 --> 00:31:03,330
more flexible with the other team so

736
00:31:03,330 --> 00:31:05,550
security people could break security

737
00:31:05,550 --> 00:31:07,530
activities into smaller pieces I've

738
00:31:07,530 --> 00:31:09,840
worked at places where you know they're

739
00:31:09,840 --> 00:31:11,160
going to do a secure code review they're

740
00:31:11,160 --> 00:31:12,750
like we just do a code freeze for three

741
00:31:12,750 --> 00:31:16,550
weeks that is never gonna happen

742
00:31:16,550 --> 00:31:19,470
software developers are like water we

743
00:31:19,470 --> 00:31:21,510
will just go around any of the obstacles

744
00:31:21,510 --> 00:31:23,430
and still get to the place where we want

745
00:31:23,430 --> 00:31:26,640
to be right like software developers are

746
00:31:26,640 --> 00:31:28,740
their original hackers like though they

747
00:31:28,740 --> 00:31:30,780
make something out of nothing literally

748
00:31:30,780 --> 00:31:32,730
every day that's their job description

749
00:31:32,730 --> 00:31:34,380
right so nothing's gonna stop them if

750
00:31:34,380 --> 00:31:36,180
they don't want to be stopped so instead

751
00:31:36,180 --> 00:31:38,280
if we break security activities into

752
00:31:38,280 --> 00:31:39,930
smaller pieces it could be better so

753
00:31:39,930 --> 00:31:42,420
what I mean is let's say you want a

754
00:31:42,420 --> 00:31:44,610
static code analysis what you could do

755
00:31:44,610 --> 00:31:47,730
is just in it run your set code analyzer

756
00:31:47,730 --> 00:31:49,950
but only look for one bug class like

757
00:31:49,950 --> 00:31:51,450
cross-site scripting that is a super

758
00:31:51,450 --> 00:31:54,900
popular issue to find and so just do

759
00:31:54,900 --> 00:31:58,590
that one one scan during that one sprint

760
00:31:58,590 --> 00:32:00,780
and then give them all of those bugs to

761
00:32:00,780 --> 00:32:02,520
fix in the next one and then don't look

762
00:32:02,520 --> 00:32:03,960
for that again look for something else

763
00:32:03,960 --> 00:32:06,570
right because every one fix all of those

764
00:32:06,570 --> 00:32:08,040
already and so that's fresh in their

765
00:32:08,040 --> 00:32:09,330
mind and hopefully they're not doing

766
00:32:09,330 --> 00:32:09,960
that anymore

767
00:32:09,960 --> 00:32:12,170
and like go down one bug class at a time

768
00:32:12,170 --> 00:32:14,550
there's a lot of ways that we could try

769
00:32:14,550 --> 00:32:17,430
to adapt the way we do things to fit in

770
00:32:17,430 --> 00:32:19,740
the type of cycles that software

771
00:32:19,740 --> 00:32:23,430
developers are doing they don't always

772
00:32:23,430 --> 00:32:25,560
validate my vulnerability assessment

773
00:32:25,560 --> 00:32:28,350
results but when I do a to it in

774
00:32:28,350 --> 00:32:30,840
production so this is I think my

775
00:32:30,840 --> 00:32:33,390
favorite meme of all time the world's

776
00:32:33,390 --> 00:32:37,890
most interesting man um it is extremely

777
00:32:37,890 --> 00:32:41,130
important i I can't say how important it

778
00:32:41,130 --> 00:32:44,340
is that we validate all of our results

779
00:32:44,340 --> 00:32:46,470
from our security tools before we send

780
00:32:46,470 --> 00:32:49,050
it to developers they don't have the

781
00:32:49,050 --> 00:32:50,520
same expertise that the security team

782
00:32:50,520 --> 00:32:52,740
does they probably don't have access to

783
00:32:52,740 --> 00:32:54,450
the same amount of tools that we have

784
00:32:54,450 --> 00:32:57,180
and for them to try to validate a result

785
00:32:57,180 --> 00:32:59,520
could take way way way way longer and

786
00:32:59,520 --> 00:33:02,040
every time we send them on a wild goose

787
00:33:02,040 --> 00:33:05,580
chase that could be a day or more we

788
00:33:05,580 --> 00:33:10,920
lose their trust there's there's way too

789
00:33:10,920 --> 00:33:13,100
many examples that I have of this

790
00:33:13,100 --> 00:33:14,740
I'm just gonna I'm just gonna leave this

791
00:33:14,740 --> 00:33:19,429
with the thought that if you don't feel

792
00:33:19,429 --> 00:33:22,280
that the scan results from your tool are

793
00:33:22,280 --> 00:33:25,100
worth looking at in reading and you

794
00:33:25,100 --> 00:33:27,679
don't have enough time as a security

795
00:33:27,679 --> 00:33:30,559
person to look at it then I think you

796
00:33:30,559 --> 00:33:33,110
should realize that it is highly likely

797
00:33:33,110 --> 00:33:34,820
that your software developers feel the

798
00:33:34,820 --> 00:33:38,780
exact same but exponentially stronger so

799
00:33:38,780 --> 00:33:41,030
if we try to you know put ourselves in

800
00:33:41,030 --> 00:33:44,360
their position that maybe if it's not

801
00:33:44,360 --> 00:33:45,860
worth our time it's probably not worth

802
00:33:45,860 --> 00:33:48,200
their time especially since it's our

803
00:33:48,200 --> 00:33:51,590
mandate to get the security done okay

804
00:33:51,590 --> 00:33:55,520
now I want to talk about training I want

805
00:33:55,520 --> 00:33:58,070
to talk about training that's specific

806
00:33:58,070 --> 00:34:00,049
to the job duties that you do so I know

807
00:34:00,049 --> 00:34:01,730
that there's a lot of IT security

808
00:34:01,730 --> 00:34:03,500
awareness training like don't click this

809
00:34:03,500 --> 00:34:08,000
link bad bad bad or you know don't let

810
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:10,159
people follow you in you know if you

811
00:34:10,159 --> 00:34:11,840
swiped your badge and risk your area

812
00:34:11,840 --> 00:34:14,179
right that's important but that's not

813
00:34:14,179 --> 00:34:16,010
what I'm gonna talk about here I want to

814
00:34:16,010 --> 00:34:18,710
talk about training that has to do

815
00:34:18,710 --> 00:34:21,109
specifically with your job

816
00:34:21,109 --> 00:34:26,409
responsibilities so if you are a coder

817
00:34:26,409 --> 00:34:30,109
secure coding training if you design

818
00:34:30,109 --> 00:34:32,929
apps threat modeling training and then

819
00:34:32,929 --> 00:34:36,050
secure design training right if you're a

820
00:34:36,050 --> 00:34:38,899
business analyst that gathers business

821
00:34:38,899 --> 00:34:39,859
requirements

822
00:34:39,859 --> 00:34:42,168
maybe that person needs you know

823
00:34:42,168 --> 00:34:45,230
security requirement training right so I

824
00:34:45,230 --> 00:34:48,619
mean specific training for your job in

825
00:34:48,619 --> 00:34:51,949
regards to security okay so the first

826
00:34:51,949 --> 00:34:54,109
thing here is let's just like take all

827
00:34:54,109 --> 00:34:57,050
the pressure off you are not expected to

828
00:34:57,050 --> 00:34:59,690
know everything all the time

829
00:34:59,690 --> 00:35:02,000
I quite often say in my talks I don't

830
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:02,930
know everything

831
00:35:02,930 --> 00:35:04,760
I hope that doesn't disappoint all of

832
00:35:04,760 --> 00:35:08,260
you because I definitely don't and me

833
00:35:08,260 --> 00:35:11,240
realizing and being ok with not knowing

834
00:35:11,240 --> 00:35:13,100
everything means it's okay for me to ask

835
00:35:13,100 --> 00:35:16,369
questions right like I really like

836
00:35:16,369 --> 00:35:18,920
address security I work for them and I

837
00:35:18,920 --> 00:35:20,930
know the product product team personally

838
00:35:20,930 --> 00:35:23,810
and I feel very comfortable as I've like

839
00:35:23,810 --> 00:35:25,160
looked online and looked to our

840
00:35:25,160 --> 00:35:26,870
documentation and played with if I

841
00:35:26,870 --> 00:35:29,600
the answer I write them and then I

842
00:35:29,600 --> 00:35:30,860
usually have to write a blog post about

843
00:35:30,860 --> 00:35:31,840
it

844
00:35:31,840 --> 00:35:35,510
but the point is is that if you can be

845
00:35:35,510 --> 00:35:36,980
okay with the fact that you don't know

846
00:35:36,980 --> 00:35:39,380
everything all of a sudden it's ok ask

847
00:35:39,380 --> 00:35:41,330
questions and then that is so much

848
00:35:41,330 --> 00:35:43,670
better in regards to training or looking

849
00:35:43,670 --> 00:35:46,010
things up it's okay to ask for a

850
00:35:46,010 --> 00:35:48,860
refresher on something um and I just

851
00:35:48,860 --> 00:35:50,840
wanna I feel like this is really

852
00:35:50,840 --> 00:35:52,970
important and sometimes if people are

853
00:35:52,970 --> 00:35:54,980
seeing your text like when I was a

854
00:35:54,980 --> 00:35:57,350
senior software developer if I didn't

855
00:35:57,350 --> 00:36:00,260
know something I would usually like to

856
00:36:00,260 --> 00:36:02,000
be honest in a meeting

857
00:36:02,000 --> 00:36:03,800
sometimes if like everyone else seemed

858
00:36:03,800 --> 00:36:05,240
to know what it was I would just like

859
00:36:05,240 --> 00:36:07,370
not like I knew and then I would go look

860
00:36:07,370 --> 00:36:10,330
it up after the meeting

861
00:36:22,240 --> 00:36:25,850
echoing what I'm saying mute your slots

862
00:36:25,850 --> 00:36:36,860
and something's going on okay good okay

863
00:36:36,860 --> 00:36:38,630
so I'm hoping everything's fine now with

864
00:36:38,630 --> 00:36:40,220
this dreaming hoping that everything's

865
00:36:40,220 --> 00:36:40,850
okay

866
00:36:40,850 --> 00:36:42,080
at first I thought someone else was

867
00:36:42,080 --> 00:36:43,460
agreeing with me and then I was like

868
00:36:43,460 --> 00:36:46,790
nope that's my voice anyway let's go to

869
00:36:46,790 --> 00:36:49,880
the next slide okay so the first thing

870
00:36:49,880 --> 00:36:51,950
that would make me so happy ever is

871
00:36:51,950 --> 00:36:56,030
security lessons for everyone in IT I

872
00:36:56,030 --> 00:36:58,010
work somewhere went and I had to do a

873
00:36:58,010 --> 00:37:00,230
lot of incident response and I realized

874
00:37:00,230 --> 00:37:03,640
that none of the teams in IT had any

875
00:37:03,640 --> 00:37:06,050
specific security training for their

876
00:37:06,050 --> 00:37:09,290
jobs so myself and a really cool guy

877
00:37:09,290 --> 00:37:12,620
named Eric made tons of specific

878
00:37:12,620 --> 00:37:14,750
training so all the SIS admin's got

879
00:37:14,750 --> 00:37:16,730
special training and then all the

880
00:37:16,730 --> 00:37:19,180
helpdesk people got special training and

881
00:37:19,180 --> 00:37:22,460
we went through team by team and it was

882
00:37:22,460 --> 00:37:26,810
so so awesome we wanted everyone to know

883
00:37:26,810 --> 00:37:29,290
like if there's an incident call us

884
00:37:29,290 --> 00:37:32,270
immediately don't try to solve it

885
00:37:32,270 --> 00:37:33,740
yourself if you're like definitely a

886
00:37:33,740 --> 00:37:36,050
security thing is happening or I feel

887
00:37:36,050 --> 00:37:38,540
weird about this just call us we'll be

888
00:37:38,540 --> 00:37:40,150
so happy you call this

889
00:37:40,150 --> 00:37:42,610
and we will help you until the end right

890
00:37:42,610 --> 00:37:45,100
like don't if you're not even sure just

891
00:37:45,100 --> 00:37:47,170
call us it's fine we have time for you

892
00:37:47,170 --> 00:37:49,270
right and this resulted in a lot of a

893
00:37:49,270 --> 00:37:51,730
lot of incidents going a lot better and

894
00:37:51,730 --> 00:37:55,210
imagine if we provided security training

895
00:37:55,210 --> 00:37:58,000
right what if you provided free security

896
00:37:58,000 --> 00:37:59,980
training to developers so this is my

897
00:37:59,980 --> 00:38:01,930
friend Nicole and I and look at us we

898
00:38:01,930 --> 00:38:03,790
are giving free security training in

899
00:38:03,790 --> 00:38:07,420
Zurich this is a class called how to

900
00:38:07,420 --> 00:38:09,520
hack your own apps that's part of our OS

901
00:38:09,520 --> 00:38:12,730
devlop project I'm she's one of the team

902
00:38:12,730 --> 00:38:14,830
members and basically you know we're

903
00:38:14,830 --> 00:38:16,840
teaching I don't even know how many

904
00:38:16,840 --> 00:38:18,850
people were in that room we had to move

905
00:38:18,850 --> 00:38:20,560
all the tables from the whole building

906
00:38:20,560 --> 00:38:23,560
into the room and is like how to hack

907
00:38:23,560 --> 00:38:25,570
things and like how to scan your own

908
00:38:25,570 --> 00:38:27,490
code and how to find answers to fix

909
00:38:27,490 --> 00:38:29,860
things and it was awesome and they all

910
00:38:29,860 --> 00:38:32,050
really wanted to learn they just had to

911
00:38:32,050 --> 00:38:35,200
have the opportunity um another thing is

912
00:38:35,200 --> 00:38:37,720
don't stop doing it

913
00:38:37,720 --> 00:38:41,680
I worked somewhere once and it was 2017

914
00:38:41,680 --> 00:38:46,420
and I was like consulting to this

915
00:38:46,420 --> 00:38:49,390
company and they were saying oh yeah we

916
00:38:49,390 --> 00:38:51,790
gave the developers secure coding

917
00:38:51,790 --> 00:38:53,770
training I don't understand why they

918
00:38:53,770 --> 00:38:55,780
make mistakes like this and then I said

919
00:38:55,780 --> 00:38:57,220
when did you give it to them and they

920
00:38:57,220 --> 00:39:00,430
said 2012 like that's five years ago you

921
00:39:00,430 --> 00:39:01,780
don't think you've had any turnover you

922
00:39:01,780 --> 00:39:03,160
don't think things have changed or maybe

923
00:39:03,160 --> 00:39:04,900
they forgot and they're like oh is it

924
00:39:04,900 --> 00:39:08,740
already been five years so we gave them

925
00:39:08,740 --> 00:39:11,620
more training so please please don't

926
00:39:11,620 --> 00:39:14,260
stop right like even if it's just a

927
00:39:14,260 --> 00:39:16,180
reminder for people or even if it's just

928
00:39:16,180 --> 00:39:18,520
a lunch and learn so just and remember

929
00:39:18,520 --> 00:39:20,380
to put that back into their head that

930
00:39:20,380 --> 00:39:24,070
security is important another thing you

931
00:39:24,070 --> 00:39:26,650
can do is what I call off-color

932
00:39:26,650 --> 00:39:29,230
job shadowing so job shadowing is great

933
00:39:29,230 --> 00:39:31,630
for learning but another thing you can

934
00:39:31,630 --> 00:39:33,970
do is if you have someone who has a bit

935
00:39:33,970 --> 00:39:37,150
of an attitude and I unfortunately have

936
00:39:37,150 --> 00:39:39,220
worked with lots of people where their

937
00:39:39,220 --> 00:39:41,440
egos are so big it's surprising that

938
00:39:41,440 --> 00:39:42,760
they can get through the double door

939
00:39:42,760 --> 00:39:47,220
ways we had and so what I've done is

940
00:39:47,220 --> 00:39:49,870
told them okay so if you don't want to

941
00:39:49,870 --> 00:39:52,330
validate your results in your report

942
00:39:52,330 --> 00:39:53,780
great you go fix

943
00:39:53,780 --> 00:39:56,660
the security bugs then you go fix them

944
00:39:56,660 --> 00:39:58,670
go to the desk sit with the developer

945
00:39:58,670 --> 00:40:01,220
you fix the bugs right if it's so

946
00:40:01,220 --> 00:40:04,190
unimportant right why don't you go do it

947
00:40:04,190 --> 00:40:07,640
and when they see how it's hard and

948
00:40:07,640 --> 00:40:10,070
another thing is like bringing someone

949
00:40:10,070 --> 00:40:13,160
on an incident I got brought on some

950
00:40:13,160 --> 00:40:15,290
security incidents I got to sit in on

951
00:40:15,290 --> 00:40:17,360
one and then I could read the office

952
00:40:17,360 --> 00:40:19,790
gated code because I'm a giant nerd that

953
00:40:19,790 --> 00:40:21,380
was on the web server and I was like oh

954
00:40:21,380 --> 00:40:24,200
that looks like SQL Oh oh my gosh look

955
00:40:24,200 --> 00:40:25,760
what they're doing and everyone in the

956
00:40:25,760 --> 00:40:27,350
room was like you can read that I'm like

957
00:40:27,350 --> 00:40:31,100
yeah and then and then all of a sudden I

958
00:40:31,100 --> 00:40:32,720
was on the incident response team and

959
00:40:32,720 --> 00:40:34,370
then eventually I was on the security

960
00:40:34,370 --> 00:40:36,830
team full-time and so this is a way that

961
00:40:36,830 --> 00:40:39,650
you could help you recruit or even just

962
00:40:39,650 --> 00:40:42,350
get developers to realize like the big

963
00:40:42,350 --> 00:40:45,050
consequences I know that we can't bring

964
00:40:45,050 --> 00:40:46,760
every person on every incident it's not

965
00:40:46,760 --> 00:40:47,570
always appropriate

966
00:40:47,570 --> 00:40:49,430
however I've had really good results

967
00:40:49,430 --> 00:40:52,630
with it if you feel that you can do that

968
00:40:52,630 --> 00:40:55,160
now I want to talk about the third part

969
00:40:55,160 --> 00:40:57,410
of number one so first we talked about

970
00:40:57,410 --> 00:40:59,720
processes that work and we talked about

971
00:40:59,720 --> 00:41:02,180
training specific to your job and now

972
00:41:02,180 --> 00:41:05,390
you know you have the knowledge and you

973
00:41:05,390 --> 00:41:07,850
have processes so you need resources

974
00:41:07,850 --> 00:41:14,450
right you need tools money so one of the

975
00:41:14,450 --> 00:41:15,890
things that I have done at a lot of

976
00:41:15,890 --> 00:41:19,100
places I have worked until that you know

977
00:41:19,100 --> 00:41:20,990
the place I work now that little startup

978
00:41:20,990 --> 00:41:23,480
that we discussed earlier who already

979
00:41:23,480 --> 00:41:26,270
had some of these is creating standards

980
00:41:26,270 --> 00:41:28,070
of what you actually expect some

981
00:41:28,070 --> 00:41:31,190
developers and I don't mean a link to

982
00:41:31,190 --> 00:41:36,170
NIST or a 200 page Excel spreadsheet or

983
00:41:36,170 --> 00:41:38,810
copying and pasting pen test results

984
00:41:38,810 --> 00:41:41,210
into a word document and just copying

985
00:41:41,210 --> 00:41:42,710
and pasting all of them forever and then

986
00:41:42,710 --> 00:41:45,410
calling that a standard I mean something

987
00:41:45,410 --> 00:41:48,830
that is five to ten pages written in

988
00:41:48,830 --> 00:41:53,060
developers words not security words that

989
00:41:53,060 --> 00:41:54,500
you've talked to the developers about

990
00:41:54,500 --> 00:41:58,550
and made sure it's possible and I don't

991
00:41:58,550 --> 00:42:00,380
mean that you should create this as a

992
00:42:00,380 --> 00:42:04,190
stick so you can go around and hit

993
00:42:04,190 --> 00:42:05,810
developers hands with it

994
00:42:05,810 --> 00:42:06,640
I

995
00:42:06,640 --> 00:42:10,060
as a tool that can help the developers

996
00:42:10,060 --> 00:42:12,700
know what you need right so if we told

997
00:42:12,700 --> 00:42:14,830
them okay you're gonna do a file upload

998
00:42:14,830 --> 00:42:17,520
that's risky business right that's very

999
00:42:17,520 --> 00:42:20,860
dangerous activity from a software

1000
00:42:20,860 --> 00:42:22,180
security standpoint

1001
00:42:22,180 --> 00:42:25,450
so here's guidelines on you know the

1002
00:42:25,450 --> 00:42:27,790
best way to do this and like you must do

1003
00:42:27,790 --> 00:42:29,950
these things and then here's a bunch of

1004
00:42:29,950 --> 00:42:32,110
other things you could do if that helps

1005
00:42:32,110 --> 00:42:35,380
right like the Canadian government

1006
00:42:35,380 --> 00:42:37,330
actually released a free tool

1007
00:42:37,330 --> 00:42:40,270
it's like virustotal but free and you

1008
00:42:40,270 --> 00:42:42,010
can host it yourselves and it's called

1009
00:42:42,010 --> 00:42:45,190
assembly-line and it basically you

1010
00:42:45,190 --> 00:42:48,940
upload files to it and it will tell you

1011
00:42:48,940 --> 00:42:51,760
in my friend John O'Brien's words if

1012
00:42:51,760 --> 00:42:58,270
it's sketch or not and it's great

1013
00:42:58,270 --> 00:42:59,860
because it's free it's great because you

1014
00:42:59,860 --> 00:43:01,390
aren't actually sending like if it's

1015
00:43:01,390 --> 00:43:02,560
private information in these files

1016
00:43:02,560 --> 00:43:04,060
you're not sending them to some third

1017
00:43:04,060 --> 00:43:06,880
party and it will give you a really good

1018
00:43:06,880 --> 00:43:08,830
picture there's all sorts of tools you

1019
00:43:08,830 --> 00:43:13,060
can buy as well um but just setting

1020
00:43:13,060 --> 00:43:15,940
specific things so another example of

1021
00:43:15,940 --> 00:43:18,490
being specific and a security standard

1022
00:43:18,490 --> 00:43:21,940
or guideline is don't say you know

1023
00:43:21,940 --> 00:43:25,480
session IDs must be ephemeral that is

1024
00:43:25,480 --> 00:43:29,290
vague and unhelpful and also like that's

1025
00:43:29,290 --> 00:43:31,480
a security word right ephemeral is a

1026
00:43:31,480 --> 00:43:33,970
security word it means short-lived again

1027
00:43:33,970 --> 00:43:36,340
that's vague instead say session IDs

1028
00:43:36,340 --> 00:43:40,510
must be minimum 64 characters they must

1029
00:43:40,510 --> 00:43:42,550
be random enough using one of these

1030
00:43:42,550 --> 00:43:44,410
random number generators that are

1031
00:43:44,410 --> 00:43:48,850
approved it must be it must expire after

1032
00:43:48,850 --> 00:43:51,970
X number of minutes of being idle it

1033
00:43:51,970 --> 00:43:54,160
must be destroyed after logging out etc

1034
00:43:54,160 --> 00:43:57,370
right like very very specific things

1035
00:43:57,370 --> 00:44:00,010
that you want and I know that you might

1036
00:44:00,010 --> 00:44:01,990
think that this is gonna annoy

1037
00:44:01,990 --> 00:44:06,400
developers but when the last secure

1038
00:44:06,400 --> 00:44:09,610
standard that I wrote I actually met

1039
00:44:09,610 --> 00:44:11,140
with all the developers and they're like

1040
00:44:11,140 --> 00:44:13,510
oh thank you thank you finally someone

1041
00:44:13,510 --> 00:44:14,830
is telling us what you actually want

1042
00:44:14,830 --> 00:44:16,270
from us because we're all guessing we're

1043
00:44:16,270 --> 00:44:18,250
like is ten minutes good is an hour good

1044
00:44:18,250 --> 00:44:18,789
it's

1045
00:44:18,789 --> 00:44:21,969
four hours good thank you 15 minutes if

1046
00:44:21,969 --> 00:44:24,309
it's completely idle and this much time

1047
00:44:24,309 --> 00:44:26,559
if not and like it was just so much

1048
00:44:26,559 --> 00:44:28,059
easier because they all know what to do

1049
00:44:28,059 --> 00:44:29,829
then right and they could also reuse

1050
00:44:29,829 --> 00:44:32,079
code because when someone wrote it and

1051
00:44:32,079 --> 00:44:33,789
they could all just use the exact same

1052
00:44:33,789 --> 00:44:36,969
one okay I've gone on enough time on

1053
00:44:36,969 --> 00:44:42,130
this one I tried to read the security

1054
00:44:42,130 --> 00:44:45,609
standard and she is crying okay so it's

1055
00:44:45,609 --> 00:44:47,429
really really important that if we write

1056
00:44:47,429 --> 00:44:50,679
documents that are to help developers

1057
00:44:50,679 --> 00:44:54,219
that they are readable I have had

1058
00:44:54,219 --> 00:44:57,130
several people suggest things to me when

1059
00:44:57,130 --> 00:44:58,539
I as a developer and I was like I don't

1060
00:44:58,539 --> 00:45:00,189
know what any of this means my brain

1061
00:45:00,189 --> 00:45:04,479
hurts and I understand and I have had

1062
00:45:04,479 --> 00:45:06,849
things where you know like I work in

1063
00:45:06,849 --> 00:45:09,459
apps SEC and I really respect the person

1064
00:45:09,459 --> 00:45:12,519
that wrote the 150 page document that

1065
00:45:12,519 --> 00:45:15,339
they sent me and I know that they're

1066
00:45:15,339 --> 00:45:16,599
very smart and I know what they're

1067
00:45:16,599 --> 00:45:21,130
talking about but it is so hard to read

1068
00:45:21,130 --> 00:45:25,179
and so hard to understand and it is so

1069
00:45:25,179 --> 00:45:28,719
so so so so long that I'm just like you

1070
00:45:28,719 --> 00:45:30,809
know I'm page five I give up right and

1071
00:45:30,809 --> 00:45:34,239
so if we can make things order more

1072
00:45:34,239 --> 00:45:36,519
concise nothing extra that you don't

1073
00:45:36,519 --> 00:45:39,579
need this goes a really really long way

1074
00:45:39,579 --> 00:45:43,059
to people actually reading it another

1075
00:45:43,059 --> 00:45:46,419
thing is that you want to socialize all

1076
00:45:46,419 --> 00:45:48,609
the tools that you have for developers

1077
00:45:48,609 --> 00:45:50,829
I worked somewhere once and I was like

1078
00:45:50,829 --> 00:45:51,939
we should write a secure coding

1079
00:45:51,939 --> 00:45:54,130
guideline and then one of the directors

1080
00:45:54,130 --> 00:45:56,380
was like we have one and everyone in the

1081
00:45:56,380 --> 00:45:58,299
room turn to her you know I was

1082
00:45:58,299 --> 00:46:00,579
brand-new consulting and everyone in the

1083
00:46:00,579 --> 00:46:02,169
room turned to her and said what and

1084
00:46:02,169 --> 00:46:05,079
she's like yeah and I said great send me

1085
00:46:05,079 --> 00:46:07,059
a link and she said oh it's just on the

1086
00:46:07,059 --> 00:46:09,339
internet you can find it yourself so I

1087
00:46:09,339 --> 00:46:11,229
went on the internet and searched 20

1088
00:46:11,229 --> 00:46:14,380
minutes and couldn't find it and really

1089
00:46:14,380 --> 00:46:16,269
if someone has to search more than two

1090
00:46:16,269 --> 00:46:18,489
minutes it's a fail right so then I

1091
00:46:18,489 --> 00:46:21,159
emailed her it took her two weeks to

1092
00:46:21,159 --> 00:46:25,150
find it yeah I also like I'm she's like

1093
00:46:25,150 --> 00:46:26,679
but all the developers know where it is

1094
00:46:26,679 --> 00:46:27,789
I don't know where it is cuz I'm a

1095
00:46:27,789 --> 00:46:29,559
director so then I was like come with me

1096
00:46:29,559 --> 00:46:31,290
so I walk up to a random dry

1097
00:46:31,290 --> 00:46:33,420
like random I'm such a jerk sometimes

1098
00:46:33,420 --> 00:46:35,250
when I try to prove points but if people

1099
00:46:35,250 --> 00:46:38,970
are gonna dismiss my concerns and I'm

1100
00:46:38,970 --> 00:46:40,440
trying really hard to break something up

1101
00:46:40,440 --> 00:46:42,120
that's really important to me I will be

1102
00:46:42,120 --> 00:46:44,490
a bit shameless about it so I'm like hey

1103
00:46:44,490 --> 00:46:46,800
dude could you send me a link to the

1104
00:46:46,800 --> 00:46:48,330
secure coding guidelines he's like what

1105
00:46:48,330 --> 00:46:50,280
we don't have one of those and she's

1106
00:46:50,280 --> 00:46:52,590
like but but I'm like and we did this to

1107
00:46:52,590 --> 00:46:54,210
four different developers and each one

1108
00:46:54,210 --> 00:46:55,440
of them said we don't have one of those

1109
00:46:55,440 --> 00:46:59,100
what are you talking about so it is you

1110
00:46:59,100 --> 00:47:00,930
don't want a whole bunch of X American

1111
00:47:00,930 --> 00:47:04,620
presidents laughing at you and you want

1112
00:47:04,620 --> 00:47:05,820
to make sure that people can actually

1113
00:47:05,820 --> 00:47:09,300
sign these things and it it's really

1114
00:47:09,300 --> 00:47:11,460
really really important that oh like if

1115
00:47:11,460 --> 00:47:13,260
you're gonna create a tool it's just so

1116
00:47:13,260 --> 00:47:14,880
important it's accessible if no one can

1117
00:47:14,880 --> 00:47:17,310
find it and you might like it doesn't

1118
00:47:17,310 --> 00:47:19,290
matter if you did tons of that to work

1119
00:47:19,290 --> 00:47:23,490
on it okay give developers security

1120
00:47:23,490 --> 00:47:26,130
tools so many people think I'm crazy

1121
00:47:26,130 --> 00:47:29,100
when I say that they're like oh if we

1122
00:47:29,100 --> 00:47:31,380
give them you know if we give them a lot

1123
00:47:31,380 --> 00:47:33,960
zap they're just gonna hackle the apps

1124
00:47:33,960 --> 00:47:35,580
and break everything and destroy our

1125
00:47:35,580 --> 00:47:38,400
network and like software developers are

1126
00:47:38,400 --> 00:47:40,830
already wildly dangerous and you've

1127
00:47:40,830 --> 00:47:42,480
already given them the most powerful

1128
00:47:42,480 --> 00:47:45,990
tools you possibly could an IDE right

1129
00:47:45,990 --> 00:47:47,430
you've already given them a thing to

1130
00:47:47,430 --> 00:47:49,980
write code and giving them permission to

1131
00:47:49,980 --> 00:47:52,980
execute code on your network right so

1132
00:47:52,980 --> 00:47:54,990
like there's dangerous as can be already

1133
00:47:54,990 --> 00:47:57,510
at this point giving them a security

1134
00:47:57,510 --> 00:48:00,720
tool with training and a safe place to

1135
00:48:00,720 --> 00:48:03,330
do security testing is a way for me to

1136
00:48:03,330 --> 00:48:06,210
get them to be part of my job which is

1137
00:48:06,210 --> 00:48:07,890
fantastic

1138
00:48:07,890 --> 00:48:10,500
um you could give them tools so that

1139
00:48:10,500 --> 00:48:12,360
they can scan their code before they you

1140
00:48:12,360 --> 00:48:14,010
know it gets down the pipeline to me

1141
00:48:14,010 --> 00:48:16,410
where I'm gonna punch it much more

1142
00:48:16,410 --> 00:48:19,230
seriously and much more precisely right

1143
00:48:19,230 --> 00:48:21,510
um you know we can give them tools so

1144
00:48:21,510 --> 00:48:24,390
that they can do code review and have it

1145
00:48:24,390 --> 00:48:26,550
helped them find security bugs like fine

1146
00:48:26,550 --> 00:48:28,830
security bugs right there's just there's

1147
00:48:28,830 --> 00:48:30,840
so many options here and these are just

1148
00:48:30,840 --> 00:48:32,820
some of the many many many many tools

1149
00:48:32,820 --> 00:48:35,280
available and some of them are from oh

1150
00:48:35,280 --> 00:48:40,860
wow yay okay next um a lot of places

1151
00:48:40,860 --> 00:48:42,240
that I've worked they've said who's

1152
00:48:42,240 --> 00:48:44,040
paying I've worked on a lot of security

1153
00:48:44,040 --> 00:48:45,059
teams

1154
00:48:45,059 --> 00:48:47,099
where they always say like you know this

1155
00:48:47,099 --> 00:48:49,109
project has to pay for this and this

1156
00:48:49,109 --> 00:48:50,759
project has to pay for that or the

1157
00:48:50,759 --> 00:48:52,049
developers should have to buy themselves

1158
00:48:52,049 --> 00:48:54,809
all you know this really big expensive

1159
00:48:54,809 --> 00:48:57,619
static code analysis tool etcetera etc

1160
00:48:57,619 --> 00:49:01,829
and I I tried to explain that if we are

1161
00:49:01,829 --> 00:49:03,599
gonna give security tools to developers

1162
00:49:03,599 --> 00:49:05,519
you know we're winning at our mandate

1163
00:49:05,519 --> 00:49:08,359
right if they're using it we are winning

1164
00:49:08,359 --> 00:49:13,979
and that like it also breeds goodwill

1165
00:49:13,979 --> 00:49:18,449
right between the teams and also no

1166
00:49:18,449 --> 00:49:20,369
matter no matter what if you if you

1167
00:49:20,369 --> 00:49:22,109
think about it you know if you have to

1168
00:49:22,109 --> 00:49:23,579
pay the consultant or you have to pay

1169
00:49:23,579 --> 00:49:25,979
for the training all of this stuff is so

1170
00:49:25,979 --> 00:49:28,529
much cheaper than a breach right like

1171
00:49:28,529 --> 00:49:30,509
whenever my my director would have like

1172
00:49:30,509 --> 00:49:32,549
a trouble signing a contract or like a

1173
00:49:32,549 --> 00:49:34,529
tool I was trying to get Erlich training

1174
00:49:34,529 --> 00:49:35,939
that we were gonna do for our developers

1175
00:49:35,939 --> 00:49:39,779
I remind him like how much how like how

1176
00:49:39,779 --> 00:49:41,819
many less incidents we were having and

1177
00:49:41,819 --> 00:49:44,999
how much our security posture posture

1178
00:49:44,999 --> 00:49:47,249
had improved as an organization and how

1179
00:49:47,249 --> 00:49:49,079
this was going to make sure it went up

1180
00:49:49,079 --> 00:49:51,239
and up and up and like every incident

1181
00:49:51,239 --> 00:49:52,919
you have is quite expensive but if you

1182
00:49:52,919 --> 00:49:54,239
have a data breach it's out of this

1183
00:49:54,239 --> 00:49:57,150
world the cost that comes out of it and

1184
00:49:57,150 --> 00:49:59,759
so I try to remind them like we are

1185
00:49:59,759 --> 00:50:01,619
saving so much money in the future we're

1186
00:50:01,619 --> 00:50:04,469
saving our reputation and so much more

1187
00:50:04,469 --> 00:50:07,709
right so um I know that budgets are a

1188
00:50:07,709 --> 00:50:09,479
thing that a lot of places fight about

1189
00:50:09,479 --> 00:50:10,769
but when you think about in terms like

1190
00:50:10,769 --> 00:50:13,380
that I hope that it can help you justify

1191
00:50:13,380 --> 00:50:14,789
some of the things you need for your

1192
00:50:14,789 --> 00:50:18,179
team okay so another thing you can do is

1193
00:50:18,179 --> 00:50:21,749
take advantage of a loss if you live in

1194
00:50:21,749 --> 00:50:24,539
a city and there's an OS chapter you can

1195
00:50:24,539 --> 00:50:26,880
offer to host them and have them come in

1196
00:50:26,880 --> 00:50:29,339
and it is much more likely your

1197
00:50:29,339 --> 00:50:32,429
employees will attend you can go to the

1198
00:50:32,429 --> 00:50:34,199
O ass meetings meet people and

1199
00:50:34,199 --> 00:50:37,979
potentially recruit awesomeness you can

1200
00:50:37,979 --> 00:50:40,679
go as an employee to Olas for free and

1201
00:50:40,679 --> 00:50:42,749
learn tons and tons of cool security

1202
00:50:42,749 --> 00:50:44,579
stuff you can use their security tools

1203
00:50:44,579 --> 00:50:47,009
like there's so much awesomeness and

1204
00:50:47,009 --> 00:50:52,669
support that wasp does I have informally

1205
00:50:52,669 --> 00:50:55,289
been doing this thing on Monday is

1206
00:50:55,289 --> 00:50:57,749
called mentoring Monday or yeah

1207
00:50:57,749 --> 00:50:58,590
mentoring Monday

1208
00:50:58,590 --> 00:51:01,470
and it's not officially in conjunction

1209
00:51:01,470 --> 00:51:04,740
with a loss but basically people are

1210
00:51:04,740 --> 00:51:07,050
tweeting at me on Twitter you know I'm

1211
00:51:07,050 --> 00:51:08,820
looking for a mentor in this or I'm

1212
00:51:08,820 --> 00:51:10,920
willing to mentor on that and then I've

1213
00:51:10,920 --> 00:51:13,470
been connecting them and a ton of people

1214
00:51:13,470 --> 00:51:15,630
who have been answering all of these

1215
00:51:15,630 --> 00:51:17,490
wonderful requests are people from Olas

1216
00:51:17,490 --> 00:51:20,340
members of the community they're so so

1217
00:51:20,340 --> 00:51:23,490
generous and there's also like they have

1218
00:51:23,490 --> 00:51:24,660
a slack and then there's a mentoring

1219
00:51:24,660 --> 00:51:26,670
channel and people go on there and like

1220
00:51:26,670 --> 00:51:29,510
just people who are powerful ask often

1221
00:51:29,510 --> 00:51:31,530
really really like giving back to the

1222
00:51:31,530 --> 00:51:33,300
community and so you can take advantage

1223
00:51:33,300 --> 00:51:35,310
by like using their tools reading their

1224
00:51:35,310 --> 00:51:37,950
documents like they build them so people

1225
00:51:37,950 --> 00:51:39,900
will use them right and so this is a

1226
00:51:39,900 --> 00:51:41,730
free resource that's available to you

1227
00:51:41,730 --> 00:51:46,200
and why not use it okay so now we are on

1228
00:51:46,200 --> 00:51:48,000
the second part of our plan recall

1229
00:51:48,000 --> 00:51:50,880
original plan was one support our

1230
00:51:50,880 --> 00:51:52,770
development team our security team and

1231
00:51:52,770 --> 00:51:56,630
the rest of IT with processes and

1232
00:51:56,630 --> 00:52:01,080
resources and oh my gosh all of a sudden

1233
00:52:01,080 --> 00:52:02,280
I'm blinking because I'm looking at the

1234
00:52:02,280 --> 00:52:04,980
really cute doc and making sure that

1235
00:52:04,980 --> 00:52:06,540
everyone has the things they need to get

1236
00:52:06,540 --> 00:52:09,990
their jobs done well and training and

1237
00:52:09,990 --> 00:52:12,180
then now if we want to maintain this and

1238
00:52:12,180 --> 00:52:13,860
improve relations between the teams and

1239
00:52:13,860 --> 00:52:15,510
make sure that this is like a complete

1240
00:52:15,510 --> 00:52:17,310
culture change that lasts we have to

1241
00:52:17,310 --> 00:52:19,440
support the culture change and so I'm

1242
00:52:19,440 --> 00:52:21,270
going to go over a few things here of

1243
00:52:21,270 --> 00:52:22,800
ideas and things that I've done that

1244
00:52:22,800 --> 00:52:26,250
have been helpful so one this is the

1245
00:52:26,250 --> 00:52:27,810
most important one if you're going to

1246
00:52:27,810 --> 00:52:29,580
take one thing away from this entire

1247
00:52:29,580 --> 00:52:32,190
presentation remember this baby with the

1248
00:52:32,190 --> 00:52:36,390
little fist and the frown we can't point

1249
00:52:36,390 --> 00:52:40,320
fingers and blame at people we ended up

1250
00:52:40,320 --> 00:52:42,330
having a big discussion of it this

1251
00:52:42,330 --> 00:52:46,980
morning at ESD see when I first started

1252
00:52:46,980 --> 00:52:49,380
doing incident management maybe my third

1253
00:52:49,380 --> 00:52:52,560
incident was absolutely terrifying I was

1254
00:52:52,560 --> 00:52:54,360
so scary and I can't tell you what it

1255
00:52:54,360 --> 00:52:58,580
was and I took the person aside and

1256
00:52:58,580 --> 00:53:01,770
yelled at them and pointed all the

1257
00:53:01,770 --> 00:53:03,660
fingers and did all of the blaming

1258
00:53:03,660 --> 00:53:05,670
because this person had broken our

1259
00:53:05,670 --> 00:53:08,670
policy and it wasn't until after I

1260
00:53:08,670 --> 00:53:10,770
realized that we hadn't really taught

1261
00:53:10,770 --> 00:53:12,360
anyone our policies

1262
00:53:12,360 --> 00:53:14,400
we hadn't taught anyone our incident

1263
00:53:14,400 --> 00:53:18,300
response processes although he did know

1264
00:53:18,300 --> 00:53:19,800
that he wasn't supposed to do that he

1265
00:53:19,800 --> 00:53:21,510
didn't understand why no one had taught

1266
00:53:21,510 --> 00:53:24,170
him the risks or the motivations and

1267
00:53:24,170 --> 00:53:26,280
then he didn't know what he was supposed

1268
00:53:26,280 --> 00:53:28,080
to do in case of an incident so then he

1269
00:53:28,080 --> 00:53:29,700
had actually completely ruined the case

1270
00:53:29,700 --> 00:53:32,820
of the chain of custody and all of the

1271
00:53:32,820 --> 00:53:36,750
evidence involved by hey just doing a an

1272
00:53:36,750 --> 00:53:38,580
erase of the disks and I'm just like oh

1273
00:53:38,580 --> 00:53:39,690
my gosh this could not have gone worse

1274
00:53:39,690 --> 00:53:43,880
right and um but then later I realized

1275
00:53:43,880 --> 00:53:46,950
if he didn't know our incident response

1276
00:53:46,950 --> 00:53:48,810
processes and he wasn't fully aware of

1277
00:53:48,810 --> 00:53:52,530
our policies or why we they exist that

1278
00:53:52,530 --> 00:53:54,420
that was a failure on my team's part and

1279
00:53:54,420 --> 00:53:58,530
that my team had a lot of work to do

1280
00:53:58,530 --> 00:54:02,850
right and it took me a long time to gain

1281
00:54:02,850 --> 00:54:04,920
back that person's confidence and Trust

1282
00:54:04,920 --> 00:54:07,740
but I did eventually it took around

1283
00:54:07,740 --> 00:54:10,110
I don't know under a year I we worked

1284
00:54:10,110 --> 00:54:11,670
together closely for two years and it

1285
00:54:11,670 --> 00:54:15,030
was quite good by the end um but so I

1286
00:54:15,030 --> 00:54:17,190
started this approach of it is not

1287
00:54:17,190 --> 00:54:18,990
Alice's fault her Bob's fault

1288
00:54:18,990 --> 00:54:23,040
it's what process was missing or what

1289
00:54:23,040 --> 00:54:25,380
safeguard was missing or did we not

1290
00:54:25,380 --> 00:54:27,120
share that information so they were

1291
00:54:27,120 --> 00:54:30,150
unaware right and then that led to so

1292
00:54:30,150 --> 00:54:33,450
many good outcomes and whenever we would

1293
00:54:33,450 --> 00:54:35,100
do a post-mortem it wasn't like this

1294
00:54:35,100 --> 00:54:37,350
person's fault it's like you know this

1295
00:54:37,350 --> 00:54:39,510
happened because of this and we tried

1296
00:54:39,510 --> 00:54:41,730
really hard not to include any names and

1297
00:54:41,730 --> 00:54:43,710
it really frustrated upper management

1298
00:54:43,710 --> 00:54:44,820
when we wouldn't include names they're

1299
00:54:44,820 --> 00:54:47,340
like who did it I might get to my fault

1300
00:54:47,340 --> 00:54:50,310
sir I lead the security team and if

1301
00:54:50,310 --> 00:54:53,250
people were unaware of what they're

1302
00:54:53,250 --> 00:54:55,020
supposed to do that's my fault

1303
00:54:55,020 --> 00:54:57,440
I take full responsibility which really

1304
00:54:57,440 --> 00:55:00,450
can annoy executives however it meant

1305
00:55:00,450 --> 00:55:02,550
that people felt not afraid to tell me

1306
00:55:02,550 --> 00:55:04,620
the truth right and people started

1307
00:55:04,620 --> 00:55:06,000
telling me all sorts of things I'm

1308
00:55:06,000 --> 00:55:08,850
trusting the team and it just it ended

1309
00:55:08,850 --> 00:55:10,290
up having such good results because of

1310
00:55:10,290 --> 00:55:12,150
it so if you're gonna take away one

1311
00:55:12,150 --> 00:55:15,150
thing please no more blaming okay so

1312
00:55:15,150 --> 00:55:17,940
next if someone makes a mistake it is

1313
00:55:17,940 --> 00:55:20,250
really important whenever you possibly

1314
00:55:20,250 --> 00:55:24,660
can to allow them to save face I was in

1315
00:55:24,660 --> 00:55:26,190
like a consulting meeting with

1316
00:55:26,190 --> 00:55:28,140
client lands and the other consultant

1317
00:55:28,140 --> 00:55:30,660
was like oh yeah you definitely need to

1318
00:55:30,660 --> 00:55:36,570
use TLS 2.0 and I was like 1.2 and this

1319
00:55:36,570 --> 00:55:38,640
was a little while ago it was before 1.3

1320
00:55:38,640 --> 00:55:42,270
was out and he's like no I see they're

1321
00:55:42,270 --> 00:55:44,820
using 1.2 and they absolutely need to

1322
00:55:44,820 --> 00:55:47,070
use 2.0 that's too old and it's not

1323
00:55:47,070 --> 00:55:49,980
acceptable anymore and I was really

1324
00:55:49,980 --> 00:55:52,850
tempted to say like just to overrule him

1325
00:55:52,850 --> 00:55:56,430
because I knew he was wrong but then I

1326
00:55:56,430 --> 00:55:58,680
thought about it and I was like I think

1327
00:55:58,680 --> 00:56:00,690
the client understands that he hasn't

1328
00:56:00,690 --> 00:56:04,740
had enough coffee and so after I sent

1329
00:56:04,740 --> 00:56:06,060
him a message I'm like hey I don't mean

1330
00:56:06,060 --> 00:56:08,370
to be rude but I think you're thinking

1331
00:56:08,370 --> 00:56:11,430
of 2.0 for this other thing and then I

1332
00:56:11,430 --> 00:56:13,320
showed him like a little link you know

1333
00:56:13,320 --> 00:56:15,570
explaining TLS 1.2 is the current

1334
00:56:15,570 --> 00:56:18,180
standard and I was like don't worry like

1335
00:56:18,180 --> 00:56:19,290
it was a 7:00 a.m. meeting

1336
00:56:19,290 --> 00:56:20,700
I totally get that you're just Webber

1337
00:56:20,700 --> 00:56:22,080
and I'm like but I'm just gonna send

1338
00:56:22,080 --> 00:56:24,810
like a little note and and just be like

1339
00:56:24,810 --> 00:56:26,700
oh just to clarify he didn't mean one

1340
00:56:26,700 --> 00:56:30,090
point to totally just you know just like

1341
00:56:30,090 --> 00:56:32,250
a no coffee problem don't worry and the

1342
00:56:32,250 --> 00:56:33,720
clients were like yeah that's cool don't

1343
00:56:33,720 --> 00:56:36,360
worry we totally got it as fine but he

1344
00:56:36,360 --> 00:56:37,620
was like really sticking in his heels

1345
00:56:37,620 --> 00:56:39,480
he's like thank you so much for like

1346
00:56:39,480 --> 00:56:41,490
covering like that I felt so stupid

1347
00:56:41,490 --> 00:56:43,800
after when I realized like you don't

1348
00:56:43,800 --> 00:56:44,940
have to feel stupid we all make mistakes

1349
00:56:44,940 --> 00:56:48,300
right and then he ended up being just so

1350
00:56:48,300 --> 00:56:50,520
wonderful in so many future situations

1351
00:56:50,520 --> 00:56:53,370
and like offering me work and helping

1352
00:56:53,370 --> 00:56:54,600
and just like being this wonderful

1353
00:56:54,600 --> 00:56:56,430
reference for me because I helped him

1354
00:56:56,430 --> 00:56:58,830
save face because I wasn't a jerk right

1355
00:56:58,830 --> 00:57:01,020
like I don't need to look better than my

1356
00:57:01,020 --> 00:57:03,450
colleague and this is a thing where you

1357
00:57:03,450 --> 00:57:06,030
can earn trust and when we have trust in

1358
00:57:06,030 --> 00:57:09,180
all the other teams like work is such a

1359
00:57:09,180 --> 00:57:11,580
pleasure we get so many more things done

1360
00:57:11,580 --> 00:57:13,470
we find problems earlier it's such a

1361
00:57:13,470 --> 00:57:17,640
huge deal another thing is is if at all

1362
00:57:17,640 --> 00:57:20,850
possible co-locate the security team

1363
00:57:20,850 --> 00:57:23,490
with the rest of IT I've worked places

1364
00:57:23,490 --> 00:57:25,860
where security is in another building or

1365
00:57:25,860 --> 00:57:28,740
not the floor I was at a place yesterday

1366
00:57:28,740 --> 00:57:31,860
and they're actually saying I was like

1367
00:57:31,860 --> 00:57:33,150
oh maybe we could say hi to your

1368
00:57:33,150 --> 00:57:35,460
security team and they're like oh we

1369
00:57:35,460 --> 00:57:37,950
don't even know where they said like

1370
00:57:37,950 --> 00:57:39,240
they didn't even know which floor they

1371
00:57:39,240 --> 00:57:40,170
were on of their

1372
00:57:40,170 --> 00:57:42,240
and if people don't even know where you

1373
00:57:42,240 --> 00:57:44,130
are how can help ask for help

1374
00:57:44,130 --> 00:57:48,329
right and so if you have to make you

1375
00:57:48,329 --> 00:57:49,740
know you have to wait for the kettle to

1376
00:57:49,740 --> 00:57:52,470
make tea next to the person you know on

1377
00:57:52,470 --> 00:57:54,630
the dev team it's highly unlikely that

1378
00:57:54,630 --> 00:57:56,099
you'll be as rude to them later

1379
00:57:56,099 --> 00:57:59,549
potentially in an email because you know

1380
00:57:59,549 --> 00:58:01,380
this person right you ride the elevator

1381
00:58:01,380 --> 00:58:04,470
or wait for the bus with this person but

1382
00:58:04,470 --> 00:58:06,960
if people are only available via email

1383
00:58:06,960 --> 00:58:08,670
and you don't see their faces and you

1384
00:58:08,670 --> 00:58:10,619
don't know them sometimes people can

1385
00:58:10,619 --> 00:58:12,720
forget that the other person reading

1386
00:58:12,720 --> 00:58:14,670
your message is a human that has

1387
00:58:14,670 --> 00:58:18,450
feelings and sometimes we send words

1388
00:58:18,450 --> 00:58:20,480
they're more harsh than we intend to

1389
00:58:20,480 --> 00:58:23,069
because emotions are running high

1390
00:58:23,069 --> 00:58:26,220
especially in incidents I don't know

1391
00:58:26,220 --> 00:58:27,359
about the rest of the people on this

1392
00:58:27,359 --> 00:58:29,490
call but when I manage incidents it's

1393
00:58:29,490 --> 00:58:34,079
equally exciting and terrifying and and

1394
00:58:34,079 --> 00:58:35,520
I get really stressed out and anxious

1395
00:58:35,520 --> 00:58:41,010
and excited and so it's it's really

1396
00:58:41,010 --> 00:58:42,780
important if we like know the other

1397
00:58:42,780 --> 00:58:45,990
people if this is a possibility okay so

1398
00:58:45,990 --> 00:58:49,619
this is a message that is more for the

1399
00:58:49,619 --> 00:58:51,329
community the secure developer as

1400
00:58:51,329 --> 00:58:53,130
opposed to a message for the people on

1401
00:58:53,130 --> 00:58:58,049
the call a lot of like so so so many

1402
00:58:58,049 --> 00:59:00,240
keynotes that I have seen at conferences

1403
00:59:00,240 --> 00:59:03,200
are the we are screwed

1404
00:59:03,200 --> 00:59:07,829
it talks so it's and and I've seen this

1405
00:59:07,829 --> 00:59:11,069
at like lots of like meetups and things

1406
00:59:11,069 --> 00:59:12,329
like that where they just tell you a

1407
00:59:12,329 --> 00:59:14,069
whole bunch of problems and they're like

1408
00:59:14,069 --> 00:59:16,829
we're really screwed or the the

1409
00:59:16,829 --> 00:59:18,180
solutions they give are super high level

1410
00:59:18,180 --> 00:59:20,220
and not actually helpful and then after

1411
00:59:20,220 --> 00:59:22,650
the security team or the people in the

1412
00:59:22,650 --> 00:59:23,910
audience feel discouraged

1413
00:59:23,910 --> 00:59:26,760
instead of encouraged like it's I'm of

1414
00:59:26,760 --> 00:59:29,220
the opinion that keynote is gonna be

1415
00:59:29,220 --> 00:59:31,579
like Robert raw we can do this let's go

1416
00:59:31,579 --> 00:59:34,260
right like with ideas and concepts and

1417
00:59:34,260 --> 00:59:36,180
information that are helpful as opposed

1418
00:59:36,180 --> 00:59:38,520
to like things that make me feel like a

1419
00:59:38,520 --> 00:59:40,950
stress ball after because I feel like

1420
00:59:40,950 --> 00:59:42,930
things are hopeless so security is like

1421
00:59:42,930 --> 00:59:44,819
really hard right it's really really

1422
00:59:44,819 --> 00:59:48,540
it's a hard field and I like having you

1423
00:59:48,540 --> 00:59:50,160
know your community leaders discourage

1424
00:59:50,160 --> 00:59:52,020
you like if there's a keynote at a

1425
00:59:52,020 --> 00:59:53,460
conference or you know your attend a

1426
00:59:53,460 --> 00:59:53,790
meet

1427
00:59:53,790 --> 00:59:55,400
and the talk is just like doom and gloom

1428
00:59:55,400 --> 00:59:59,490
fear uncertainty and doubt food sorts of

1429
00:59:59,490 --> 01:00:01,860
things like that is really unhelpful so

1430
01:00:01,860 --> 01:00:06,330
I would like to ask all people here if

1431
01:00:06,330 --> 01:00:08,220
you're booking talks try really hard not

1432
01:00:08,220 --> 01:00:10,910
to book the were so screwed topics

1433
01:00:10,910 --> 01:00:13,170
because I find them discouraging and I

1434
01:00:13,170 --> 01:00:15,870
know a lot of other people do and I just

1435
01:00:15,870 --> 01:00:17,760
don't think it's it's hoping like I go

1436
01:00:17,760 --> 01:00:19,830
to a conference to learn stuff and meet

1437
01:00:19,830 --> 01:00:24,330
cool people and and that doesn't teach a

1438
01:00:24,330 --> 01:00:26,520
lot of us and like we're at a security

1439
01:00:26,520 --> 01:00:27,720
conference because we know there's a

1440
01:00:27,720 --> 01:00:29,310
problem right we want to know how to fix

1441
01:00:29,310 --> 01:00:32,490
it and so I appeal to all of you to just

1442
01:00:32,490 --> 01:00:34,410
remember this when you're booking things

1443
01:00:34,410 --> 01:00:36,840
or maybe like if you see an abstract

1444
01:00:36,840 --> 01:00:38,700
like that ask them ok so what are the

1445
01:00:38,700 --> 01:00:40,260
key takeaways of how we can fix these

1446
01:00:40,260 --> 01:00:42,840
problems right like you can steer you

1447
01:00:42,840 --> 01:00:44,040
don't have to like reject these people

1448
01:00:44,040 --> 01:00:45,330
but you could like steer them towards

1449
01:00:45,330 --> 01:00:47,040
like more positive outcomes and then

1450
01:00:47,040 --> 01:00:48,930
like your audience will hopefully not

1451
01:00:48,930 --> 01:00:53,100
feel discouraged ok so the last one that

1452
01:00:53,100 --> 01:00:55,670
is on this list is being a true leader

1453
01:00:55,670 --> 01:01:00,150
so for all people on this call every day

1454
01:01:00,150 --> 01:01:03,480
that you go into work you set an example

1455
01:01:03,480 --> 01:01:06,060
to everyone around you about what is

1456
01:01:06,060 --> 01:01:08,510
acceptable and what's not acceptable

1457
01:01:08,510 --> 01:01:12,120
right and I worked somewhere with a

1458
01:01:12,120 --> 01:01:14,160
manager that would say it's us and then

1459
01:01:14,160 --> 01:01:16,850
in regards to the developer team and

1460
01:01:16,850 --> 01:01:19,530
would always talk about their crappy

1461
01:01:19,530 --> 01:01:22,290
code and their crappy apps and all all

1462
01:01:22,290 --> 01:01:23,930
of these things and if that's that the

1463
01:01:23,930 --> 01:01:27,120
example that that that was ok to say

1464
01:01:27,120 --> 01:01:29,730
there was ok to try to talk another team

1465
01:01:29,730 --> 01:01:31,440
that we worked with and have these

1466
01:01:31,440 --> 01:01:34,290
negative feelings and I personally

1467
01:01:34,290 --> 01:01:36,290
believe that that is not true leadership

1468
01:01:36,290 --> 01:01:39,600
and because you're leading us down a bad

1469
01:01:39,600 --> 01:01:43,470
path instead of towards success and if

1470
01:01:43,470 --> 01:01:47,040
we already are it's us against them

1471
01:01:47,040 --> 01:01:49,020
before we even get to the meeting that's

1472
01:01:49,020 --> 01:01:51,000
not gonna help us you know find

1473
01:01:51,000 --> 01:01:53,010
synergies solutions and all the other

1474
01:01:53,010 --> 01:01:54,600
buzzwords of the things that we actually

1475
01:01:54,600 --> 01:01:58,800
want right so I would like to call upon

1476
01:01:58,800 --> 01:02:01,560
the people who are listening to try

1477
01:02:01,560 --> 01:02:03,420
really hard to always set a good example

1478
01:02:03,420 --> 01:02:05,890
and I believe

1479
01:02:05,890 --> 01:02:09,040
true leaders are people who even if you

1480
01:02:09,040 --> 01:02:10,720
feel like talking trash you try really

1481
01:02:10,720 --> 01:02:14,500
hard not to or or say those things like

1482
01:02:14,500 --> 01:02:18,040
at home or to your friend right don't

1483
01:02:18,040 --> 01:02:19,930
say this to other people at work don't

1484
01:02:19,930 --> 01:02:22,420
you know enemy or if you have something

1485
01:02:22,420 --> 01:02:24,550
bad to say like usually if I have a

1486
01:02:24,550 --> 01:02:26,470
problem with someone I go directly to

1487
01:02:26,470 --> 01:02:28,780
them and I say this happened I need to

1488
01:02:28,780 --> 01:02:32,380
talk to you about it right rather than

1489
01:02:32,380 --> 01:02:34,000
for instance tweeting about it and

1490
01:02:34,000 --> 01:02:35,230
telling everyone I'm pointing at them

1491
01:02:35,230 --> 01:02:36,930
and being like that's crap

1492
01:02:36,930 --> 01:02:40,750
right like sometimes setting a good

1493
01:02:40,750 --> 01:02:44,470
example is a lot more work but I hope

1494
01:02:44,470 --> 01:02:46,180
that you will find the same results that

1495
01:02:46,180 --> 01:02:49,750
I have which is that by always trying to

1496
01:02:49,750 --> 01:02:52,420
set a positive example like something

1497
01:02:52,420 --> 01:02:54,460
that you would be proud for other people

1498
01:02:54,460 --> 01:02:57,940
to think of you like that other people

1499
01:02:57,940 --> 01:02:59,260
are more likely to follow in your

1500
01:02:59,260 --> 01:03:01,990
positive steps sorry about that it looks

1501
01:03:01,990 --> 01:03:05,290
excited sorry about that sound no matter

1502
01:03:05,290 --> 01:03:06,910
how many times I mute it and it

1503
01:03:06,910 --> 01:03:09,610
magically unmutes itself but more

1504
01:03:09,610 --> 01:03:13,210
importantly just if you always set an

1505
01:03:13,210 --> 01:03:14,920
example that you are quite proud of and

1506
01:03:14,920 --> 01:03:16,720
that you would want people to know and

1507
01:03:16,720 --> 01:03:19,000
think of you as other people will follow

1508
01:03:19,000 --> 01:03:19,510
you

1509
01:03:19,510 --> 01:03:22,060
till the ends of the earth right like

1510
01:03:22,060 --> 01:03:24,670
when you do the right thing even when

1511
01:03:24,670 --> 01:03:30,010
it's hard it's noticed and it is valued

1512
01:03:30,010 --> 01:03:33,820
by a lot of people so please try really

1513
01:03:33,820 --> 01:03:36,670
hard to lead by example and with that I

1514
01:03:36,670 --> 01:03:39,300
would like to do a small conclusion I

1515
01:03:39,300 --> 01:03:41,890
want to summarize the plan and how all

1516
01:03:41,890 --> 01:03:44,080
of you are going to be awesome at this

1517
01:03:44,080 --> 01:03:46,270
plan and then I'm gonna give you a few

1518
01:03:46,270 --> 01:03:47,650
resources you might want to take

1519
01:03:47,650 --> 01:03:49,990
screenshots it's up to you and but these

1520
01:03:49,990 --> 01:03:51,430
slides will be available and the

1521
01:03:51,430 --> 01:03:53,770
recording later um but I want to give

1522
01:03:53,770 --> 01:03:55,570
you some resources they're all free to

1523
01:03:55,570 --> 01:03:58,870
help you start so conclusion plan so we

1524
01:03:58,870 --> 01:04:00,700
are going to try really hard to support

1525
01:04:00,700 --> 01:04:02,650
our developers security team and the

1526
01:04:02,650 --> 01:04:06,400
rest of ID of IT with processes training

1527
01:04:06,400 --> 01:04:08,230
and resources so that they can

1528
01:04:08,230 --> 01:04:10,510
confidently get their jobs done and stop

1529
01:04:10,510 --> 01:04:13,120
all this friction and then we want to

1530
01:04:13,120 --> 01:04:14,710
initiate and maintain a culture change

1531
01:04:14,710 --> 01:04:16,510
towards a more positive and

1532
01:04:16,510 --> 01:04:18,990
collaborative culture

1533
01:04:18,990 --> 01:04:21,280
so I have a call to action for all of

1534
01:04:21,280 --> 01:04:22,990
you and usually if I am a person with

1535
01:04:22,990 --> 01:04:24,339
people I make them raise their right

1536
01:04:24,339 --> 01:04:27,190
hand and agree to this with me because

1537
01:04:27,190 --> 01:04:30,220
when people say things out loud there

1538
01:04:30,220 --> 01:04:32,770
and they promise it there are 80 percent

1539
01:04:32,770 --> 01:04:34,539
more likely to actually do it so I would

1540
01:04:34,539 --> 01:04:37,150
like you to read this to yourself in

1541
01:04:37,150 --> 01:04:40,650
your head and make a promise to yourself

1542
01:04:40,650 --> 01:04:42,789
because you're the most important one

1543
01:04:42,789 --> 01:04:45,339
that you can promise that you will try

1544
01:04:45,339 --> 01:04:48,280
to do better so it has to start

1545
01:04:48,280 --> 01:04:50,380
somewhere and I would like it to start

1546
01:04:50,380 --> 01:04:53,410
with you I would like you to try really

1547
01:04:53,410 --> 01:04:55,569
hard to be the positive force in your

1548
01:04:55,569 --> 01:04:58,599
work place and try really hard to get

1549
01:04:58,599 --> 01:05:00,940
developers and security to meet in the

1550
01:05:00,940 --> 01:05:02,710
middle and sometimes that means

1551
01:05:02,710 --> 01:05:03,960
admitting that we're vulnerable

1552
01:05:03,960 --> 01:05:07,240
admitting we don't know something it

1553
01:05:07,240 --> 01:05:10,240
means you know if you know someone did

1554
01:05:10,240 --> 01:05:11,890
something wrong instead of saying like

1555
01:05:11,890 --> 01:05:14,980
it was someone so instead saying okay so

1556
01:05:14,980 --> 01:05:17,559
you know this safeguard was actually

1557
01:05:17,559 --> 01:05:19,390
turned off a long time ago and I don't

1558
01:05:19,390 --> 01:05:20,770
know how that happened but we need to

1559
01:05:20,770 --> 01:05:21,940
turn it back on immediately

1560
01:05:21,940 --> 01:05:23,799
so mistake like this can't happen again

1561
01:05:23,799 --> 01:05:27,190
right and building trust and sometimes

1562
01:05:27,190 --> 01:05:29,440
it someone has to start and it can start

1563
01:05:29,440 --> 01:05:33,880
with you so I would like you to well

1564
01:05:33,880 --> 01:05:35,710
quite frankly to do this but I'm not

1565
01:05:35,710 --> 01:05:38,799
telling you I am appealing to you to do

1566
01:05:38,799 --> 01:05:40,270
the right thing when you see an

1567
01:05:40,270 --> 01:05:43,480
opportunity and with that here are some

1568
01:05:43,480 --> 01:05:46,359
resources for you so I have a blog I

1569
01:05:46,359 --> 01:05:49,599
have two blogs I'm on Twitter

1570
01:05:49,599 --> 01:05:53,319
and I try to tweet smart things and I

1571
01:05:53,319 --> 01:05:56,799
have a streaming show on YouTube that's

1572
01:05:56,799 --> 01:05:59,559
part of my open source project Alice dev

1573
01:05:59,559 --> 01:06:01,980
swap where we actually implement

1574
01:06:01,980 --> 01:06:04,420
technical ideas they talk about in my

1575
01:06:04,420 --> 01:06:06,130
talk because it would take an entire

1576
01:06:06,130 --> 01:06:08,859
talk to actually show one or two of the

1577
01:06:08,859 --> 01:06:11,470
ideas that I do so instead my friends

1578
01:06:11,470 --> 01:06:14,829
Nancy Nicole Francisca and I meet on the

1579
01:06:14,829 --> 01:06:17,069
internet we all live in different places

1580
01:06:17,069 --> 01:06:19,900
and then we like do technical things

1581
01:06:19,900 --> 01:06:21,760
together and make videos and then just

1582
01:06:21,760 --> 01:06:23,859
release them for free so if there's a

1583
01:06:23,859 --> 01:06:25,420
specific thing you want to learn we

1584
01:06:25,420 --> 01:06:27,160
might have a lesson on it and if we

1585
01:06:27,160 --> 01:06:29,650
don't you can always tweet at us because

1586
01:06:29,650 --> 01:06:32,770
maybe you will do one

1587
01:06:32,770 --> 01:06:36,730
with that oh this is um this is the best

1588
01:06:36,730 --> 01:06:39,010
blog post to start with if you are

1589
01:06:39,010 --> 01:06:40,810
interested in learning about how to make

1590
01:06:40,810 --> 01:06:43,960
more secure software this short list a

1591
01:06:43,960 --> 01:06:46,740
short link is to one of my blog posts

1592
01:06:46,740 --> 01:06:50,680
that specifically is a whole bunch of

1593
01:06:50,680 --> 01:06:53,260
free resources that some are by me some

1594
01:06:53,260 --> 01:06:56,050
are by other people of just how to make

1595
01:06:56,050 --> 01:06:58,240
more secure software and where to start

1596
01:06:58,240 --> 01:07:00,820
and what to learn from some of them are

1597
01:07:00,820 --> 01:07:03,190
the things that I learned that I used to

1598
01:07:03,190 --> 01:07:04,570
learn if it wasn't some of them are ones

1599
01:07:04,570 --> 01:07:07,000
that I created after I've learned more

1600
01:07:07,000 --> 01:07:09,840
stuff so I hope you find that helpful

1601

cultural challenges that you're sharing

1621
01:08:06,040 --> 01:08:10,870
with us so um I've got one one question

1622
01:08:10,870 --> 01:08:15,610
is how do you what is your tip for for

1623
01:08:15,610 --> 01:08:18,010
product or I just generally R&D teams to

1624
01:08:18,010 --> 01:08:20,770
kind of prioritize security issues as

1625
01:08:20,770 --> 01:08:24,390
I've seen a lot of you know times were

1626
01:08:24,390 --> 01:08:26,500
security issues in the backlog but

1627
01:08:26,500 --> 01:08:29,260
products usually kind of push that back

1628
01:08:29,260 --> 01:08:31,299
and you know say they do it in the next

1629
01:08:31,299 --> 01:08:34,180
sprint and then the next sprint and you

1630
01:08:34,180 --> 01:08:37,810
know and then it goes six months fast um

1631
01:08:37,810 --> 01:08:42,069
I have a couple strategies I worked one

1632
01:08:42,069 --> 01:08:44,380
place and no one would fix anything

1633
01:08:44,380 --> 01:08:44,710
because

1634
01:08:44,710 --> 01:08:47,319
a really big deadline coming up they

1635
01:08:47,319 --> 01:08:48,670
were gonna release the thing with a lot

1636
01:08:48,670 --> 01:08:52,210
of vulnerabilities and so I made a risk

1637
01:08:52,210 --> 01:08:55,330
sign-off sheet and then I explained all

1638
01:08:55,330 --> 01:08:57,880
of the risks in detail of specifically

1639
01:08:57,880 --> 01:08:59,529
how these things could harm our business

1640
01:08:59,529 --> 01:09:01,420
and specifically how likely they would

1641
01:09:01,420 --> 01:09:04,630
based on our threat models so we had a

1642
01:09:04,630 --> 01:09:07,259
couple of very specific concerns and

1643
01:09:07,259 --> 01:09:09,520
then I sent it to the chief information

1644
01:09:09,520 --> 01:09:12,729
officer and the departmental security

1645
01:09:12,729 --> 01:09:15,339
officer who was in charge of physical

1646
01:09:15,339 --> 01:09:17,950
and IT security and then I sent it to

1647
01:09:17,950 --> 01:09:19,779
them looked like this little post a note

1648
01:09:19,779 --> 01:09:21,488
that said hey I need your signatures

1649
01:09:21,488 --> 01:09:23,560
that you're ok with all of these risks

1650
01:09:23,560 --> 01:09:25,630
and then the departmental security

1651
01:09:25,630 --> 01:09:27,250
officer called me music Tony I'm not

1652
01:09:27,250 --> 01:09:34,000
saying this crap I was like well like

1653
01:09:34,000 --> 01:09:36,339
you know it's just like everyone tells

1654
01:09:36,339 --> 01:09:38,020
me they don't have time before this big

1655
01:09:38,020 --> 01:09:39,790
like you know big deadline that we have

1656
01:09:39,790 --> 01:09:42,130
and he's like you told them bill sent

1657
01:09:42,130 --> 01:09:44,859
you and then I was like well bill said

1658
01:09:44,859 --> 01:09:46,359
and then it's like everyone just chopped

1659
01:09:46,359 --> 01:09:49,000
it up and was like oh my god and then

1660
01:09:49,000 --> 01:09:53,979
everything got fixed like bill said is

1661
01:09:53,979 --> 01:09:58,890
the magical word another place I worked

1662
01:09:58,890 --> 01:10:03,340
they the no one no one wanted to do

1663
01:10:03,340 --> 01:10:06,280
anything and I really wanted them to use

1664
01:10:06,280 --> 01:10:08,560
security headers and they weren't using

1665
01:10:08,560 --> 01:10:12,340
any and it was causing some serious

1666
01:10:12,340 --> 01:10:15,190
problems and we also weren't using HTTPS

1667
01:10:15,190 --> 01:10:17,440
and I truly also a really quick win

1668
01:10:17,440 --> 01:10:19,960
right away right yes

1669
01:10:19,960 --> 01:10:23,250
I mean CSP could be a very hard but

1670
01:10:23,250 --> 01:10:25,330
generally speaking that's it's an easy

1671
01:10:25,330 --> 01:10:27,489
win it's not an architecture change most

1672
01:10:27,489 --> 01:10:30,130
of the times and stuff like that yeah so

1673
01:10:30,130 --> 01:10:34,210
I just made a proof of concept of me

1674
01:10:34,210 --> 01:10:36,489
like framing our website stealing some

1675
01:10:36,489 --> 01:10:39,370
credentials and then also like you know

1676
01:10:39,370 --> 01:10:41,670
some links to try hunts blog about why

1677
01:10:41,670 --> 01:10:45,010
HTTPS is important and like bad things

1678
01:10:45,010 --> 01:10:48,550
that could happen and then like also you

1679
01:10:48,550 --> 01:10:50,110
know he makes this website called why no

1680
01:10:50,110 --> 01:10:55,480
HTTPS where publicly which is like I am

1681
01:10:55,480 --> 01:10:57,719
a fear on anyway

1682
01:10:57,719 --> 01:11:01,770
and so like I sent them this link and I

1683
01:11:01,770 --> 01:11:03,989
was like hey you've won an iPad click on

1684
01:11:03,989 --> 01:11:06,150
this link and their Tanya we know this

1685
01:11:06,150 --> 01:11:07,830
is from you and we know we didn't win an

1686
01:11:07,830 --> 01:11:11,699
iPad then I responded back we have

1687
01:11:11,699 --> 01:11:13,890
20,000 employees and you know damn well

1688
01:11:13,890 --> 01:11:16,380
at least one of them would quit

1689
01:11:16,380 --> 01:11:18,000
so they clicked and then they're like

1690
01:11:18,000 --> 01:11:21,330
wow there's all yellow everywhere and it

1691
01:11:21,330 --> 01:11:23,070
looks it looks just like our real

1692
01:11:23,070 --> 01:11:24,630
website I'm like that's our production

1693
01:11:24,630 --> 01:11:26,280
website and they're like what and

1694
01:11:26,280 --> 01:11:27,810
they're like well this is bright yellow

1695
01:11:27,810 --> 01:11:30,090
Tanya anyone would see it and not do it

1696
01:11:30,090 --> 01:11:32,190
I'm like it's yellow so you can see it I

1697
01:11:32,190 --> 01:11:34,650
worked hard to make it yellow so it's

1698
01:11:34,650 --> 01:11:36,900
visible it's regularly see-through and

1699
01:11:36,900 --> 01:11:40,110
they're like oh my gosh and I how long

1700
01:11:40,110 --> 01:11:41,460
did this take you I'm like 45 minutes

1701
01:11:41,460 --> 01:11:43,949
dude and then they're like how do we do

1702
01:11:43,949 --> 01:11:47,100
these security headers Ryan and all of a

1703
01:11:47,100 --> 01:11:48,090
sudden they're like we're just gonna

1704
01:11:48,090 --> 01:11:50,400
roll it like a bunch of them and I

1705
01:11:50,400 --> 01:11:52,469
didn't win on all of them but I got them

1706
01:11:52,469 --> 01:11:55,880
to implement three and HTTPS Everywhere

1707
01:11:55,880 --> 01:11:58,830
which I felt was like a giant win for a

1708
01:11:58,830 --> 01:12:00,449
place that previously just told the

1709
01:12:00,449 --> 01:12:02,940
security team where to go right and like

1710
01:12:02,940 --> 01:12:05,130
the roof of concept really went a long

1711
01:12:05,130 --> 01:12:10,590
way but it doesn't make you popular that

1712
01:12:10,590 --> 01:12:13,530
stunt was not very cool like I was in

1713
01:12:13,530 --> 01:12:16,680
some hot water but I felt it was worth

1714
01:12:16,680 --> 01:12:20,370
it yep that's taking the risk for making

1715
01:12:20,370 --> 01:12:24,930
security happen yeah so when yeah so I'm

1716
01:12:24,930 --> 01:12:27,500
not always popular

1717
01:12:28,880 --> 01:12:31,980
I think can can i Rania me

1718
01:12:31,980 --> 01:12:35,850
yes but Sam I uh can you hear me now

1719
01:12:35,850 --> 01:12:41,969
noise I think okay talks to someone can

1720
01:12:41,969 --> 01:12:44,430
hear me um if you can hear me on slack

1721
01:12:44,430 --> 01:12:45,540
and someone just say if you can hear me

1722
01:12:45,540 --> 01:12:46,620
or not but that I think that's all the

1723
01:12:46,620 --> 01:12:49,290
time we have today so I wanted to say a

1724
01:12:49,290 --> 01:12:51,750
huge thank you to you Tanya and for

1725
01:12:51,750 --> 01:12:53,730
getting involved and for sharing all

1726
01:12:53,730 --> 01:12:55,739
that insight because I know I really

1727
01:12:55,739 --> 01:12:57,330
enjoyed it and based on some of the

1728
01:12:57,330 --> 01:12:58,739
discussion on the slack I think everyone

1729
01:12:58,739 --> 01:13:00,360
can definitely relate to some of the war

1730
01:13:00,360 --> 01:13:03,840
stories you were speaking about so as

1731
01:13:03,840 --> 01:13:05,730
Tanya said and the session will be live

1732
01:13:05,730 --> 01:13:07,679
on the website afterwards we'll also

1733
01:13:07,679 --> 01:13:09,390
post all the resources that she spoke

1734
01:13:09,390 --> 01:13:11,909
about and so you can find them easily

1735
01:13:11,909 --> 01:13:14,729
II and as well as the conferences that

1736
01:13:14,729 --> 01:13:16,199
she mentioned within the session and any

1737
01:13:16,199 --> 01:13:17,610
other little tidbits we'll add them all

1738
01:13:17,610 --> 01:13:20,610
so it's one easy place to find and but

1739
01:13:20,610 --> 01:13:22,320
again thank you so much Anya hopefully
