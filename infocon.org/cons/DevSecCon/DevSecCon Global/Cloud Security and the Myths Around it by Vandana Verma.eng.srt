screen and what are we going to do

57
00:02:22,310 --> 00:02:24,349
in the session I will brief you over

58
00:02:24,349 --> 00:02:26,060
that and we will be taking questions

59
00:02:26,060 --> 00:02:30,170
once the session is over so that we have

60
00:02:30,170 --> 00:02:40,489

61
00:02:40,489 --> 00:02:42,500
you're here please let me know once we

62

63
00:02:43,940 --> 00:02:48,200
my screen perfect

64
00:02:48,200 --> 00:02:51,739
so about cloud security and mitts and

65
00:02:51,739 --> 00:02:53,920
why are we talking about that because

66
00:02:53,920 --> 00:02:57,379
this concept is not new but still people

67
00:02:57,379 --> 00:03:00,829
have a lot of misconceptions about cloud

68
00:03:00,829 --> 00:03:04,489
that how cloud is handled and what it is

69
00:03:04,489 --> 00:03:06,970
all about and there are so many

70
00:03:06,970 --> 00:03:10,069
questions around the same so today in

71
00:03:10,069 --> 00:03:12,079
this presentation we will be walking you

72
00:03:12,079 --> 00:03:15,409
through that about me as I mentioned

73
00:03:15,409 --> 00:03:17,780
that I am one of the secure area tech

74
00:03:17,780 --> 00:03:19,540
with one of the multinational companies

75
00:03:19,540 --> 00:03:22,160
very enthusiastic about cloud security

76
00:03:22,160 --> 00:03:24,919
and application security apart from that

77
00:03:24,919 --> 00:03:26,870
I am associated with a few of the

78
00:03:26,870 --> 00:03:31,639
communities to help them grow more women

79
00:03:31,639 --> 00:03:34,760
power in the organizations and in

80
00:03:34,760 --> 00:03:37,040
cybersecurity apart from that I also

81
00:03:37,040 --> 00:03:40,040
work with certain schools and colleges

82
00:03:40,040 --> 00:03:43,549
to have more girls participation because

83
00:03:43,549 --> 00:03:46,669
especially I would love to have more

84
00:03:46,669 --> 00:03:48,349
participation from the middle school

85
00:03:48,349 --> 00:03:50,959
girls because when we were growing up we

86
00:03:50,959 --> 00:03:53,900
we did not have internet or phones in

87
00:03:53,900 --> 00:03:57,500
our hands but nowadays all the girls and

88
00:03:57,500 --> 00:03:59,780
everyone not just girls but everyone has

89
00:03:59,780 --> 00:04:03,290
like handheld devices so to protect that

90
00:04:03,290 --> 00:04:06,349
I work with the community to get more a

91
00:04:06,349 --> 00:04:09,129
safe place for the kids

92
00:04:09,129 --> 00:04:12,680
apart from that today's agenda we will

93
00:04:12,680 --> 00:04:15,590
be covering cloud basics because we want

94
00:04:15,590 --> 00:04:18,228
to know about what cloud is there are a

95
00:04:18,228 --> 00:04:20,209
lot of people who still don't know what

96
00:04:20,209 --> 00:04:21,649
cloud is but because everyone talks

97
00:04:21,649 --> 00:04:24,850
about router out loud but apart from the

98
00:04:24,850 --> 00:04:26,500
the people who are actually working on

99
00:04:26,500 --> 00:04:30,040
it they don't have idea that what cloud

100
00:04:30,040 --> 00:04:32,950
is so we will be covering that and then

101
00:04:32,950 --> 00:04:35,440
what are the general myths around the

102
00:04:35,440 --> 00:04:40,650
cloud and what's these myths mean to

103
00:04:40,650 --> 00:04:43,000
different people who are working on it

104
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:45,130
on were dealing with it like developers

105
00:04:45,130 --> 00:04:47,680
see source which receive information

106
00:04:47,680 --> 00:04:50,620
security officer CEO which is to your

107
00:04:50,620 --> 00:04:54,760
CEO and then other people miscellaneous

108
00:04:54,760 --> 00:04:57,600
people who were are working on it

109
00:04:57,600 --> 00:05:00,520
so this was my assumption when I was

110
00:05:00,520 --> 00:05:02,860
when I heard about cloud or cloud

111
00:05:02,860 --> 00:05:06,100
computing that how will I transfer my

112
00:05:06,100 --> 00:05:09,460
data and store the data in the cloud how

113
00:05:09,460 --> 00:05:11,710
I am going to access it will it be

114
00:05:11,710 --> 00:05:14,440
secure then I started researching about

115
00:05:14,440 --> 00:05:17,230
the cloud or cloud computing and got to

116
00:05:17,230 --> 00:05:20,080
know that there are multiple vendors who

117
00:05:20,080 --> 00:05:22,860
help you in storing the data and

118
00:05:22,860 --> 00:05:25,570
managing your data bringing up servers

119
00:05:25,570 --> 00:05:30,240
and helping in scalability in the cloud

120
00:05:30,420 --> 00:05:35,260
so this is the usual intro to the cloud

121
00:05:35,260 --> 00:05:37,390
in simple terms it's all about the

122
00:05:37,390 --> 00:05:40,000
delivery of computing services for

123
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:44,140
servers storage databases networking you

124
00:05:44,140 --> 00:05:47,890
who software's on the cloud take help

125
00:05:47,890 --> 00:05:51,370
for the analytics of your data which is

126
00:05:51,370 --> 00:05:53,560
available more and more because as we

127
00:05:53,560 --> 00:05:56,110
are growing the organization is growing

128
00:05:56,110 --> 00:05:59,440
the user base is growing there is lot of

129
00:05:59,440 --> 00:06:02,170
need for analytics so we take help in

130
00:06:02,170 --> 00:06:08,620
the cloud for the growing data cloud

131
00:06:08,620 --> 00:06:11,200
also helps in multi-tenancy we can share

132
00:06:11,200 --> 00:06:14,470
resources help in scalability elasticity

133
00:06:14,470 --> 00:06:17,740
we can use it paper use even we can self

134
00:06:17,740 --> 00:06:19,480
provision our resources which never used

135
00:06:19,480 --> 00:06:22,900
to happen earlier now we can leverage

136
00:06:22,900 --> 00:06:24,940
all of these with the help of the cloud

137
00:06:24,940 --> 00:06:27,850
we're a cloud provider is helping us

138
00:06:27,850 --> 00:06:30,390
making sure we have everything in place

139
00:06:30,390 --> 00:06:32,830
what we need at a given point of time

140
00:06:32,830 --> 00:06:34,720
specially for the small scale

141
00:06:34,720 --> 00:06:36,820
organizations or

142
00:06:36,820 --> 00:06:38,580
now we have seen there is a trend of

143
00:06:38,580 --> 00:06:42,130
growing startups how they are able to

144
00:06:42,130 --> 00:06:45,040
grow from a small size company to a big

145
00:06:45,040 --> 00:06:47,140
size because there are without services

146
00:06:47,140 --> 00:06:48,610
which are available within the small

147
00:06:48,610 --> 00:06:51,940
amount of budget that they have or the

148
00:06:51,940 --> 00:06:53,800
infrastructure that they need cloud

149
00:06:53,800 --> 00:06:56,890
actually provides you with it apart from

150
00:06:56,890 --> 00:06:59,980
that cloud service actually provides you

151
00:06:59,980 --> 00:07:02,200
with different models which a

152
00:07:02,200 --> 00:07:04,810
traditional IT or the data center you

153
00:07:04,810 --> 00:07:07,170
did not have it and now it's available

154
00:07:07,170 --> 00:07:09,810
which is infrastructure as a service

155
00:07:09,810 --> 00:07:12,250
where and you have you are actually

156
00:07:12,250 --> 00:07:14,170
leveraging the infrastructure of the

157
00:07:14,170 --> 00:07:17,290
cloud service provider you actually have

158
00:07:17,290 --> 00:07:19,960
you leverage a platform also of the

159
00:07:19,960 --> 00:07:21,910
cloud providers which is a users

160
00:07:21,910 --> 00:07:25,290
platform as a service then we have

161
00:07:25,290 --> 00:07:27,610
software as a service environment which

162
00:07:27,610 --> 00:07:31,360
is like growing immensely apart from

163
00:07:31,360 --> 00:07:33,840
that we have different models

164
00:07:33,840 --> 00:07:37,510
public-private hybrid so I just want to

165
00:07:37,510 --> 00:07:40,720
give you a little bit background on how

166
00:07:40,720 --> 00:07:43,570
you can actually relate it in a daily

167
00:07:43,570 --> 00:07:46,870
life actually I read a really nice

168
00:07:46,870 --> 00:07:50,500
article on how busines actually can be

169
00:07:50,500 --> 00:07:55,300
treated or can be considered or taken in

170
00:07:55,300 --> 00:07:58,510
regards to all of these models

171
00:07:58,510 --> 00:08:00,310
I am infrastructure as a service

172
00:08:00,310 --> 00:08:02,770
platform as a service so let's I'll just

173
00:08:02,770 --> 00:08:04,960
walk you through on the traditional

174
00:08:04,960 --> 00:08:09,450
on-premise model so when we save you're

175
00:08:09,450 --> 00:08:12,100
baking a pizza you're doing everything

176
00:08:12,100 --> 00:08:14,200
yourself when you are talking about imp

177
00:08:14,200 --> 00:08:15,940
remise everything from getting the

178
00:08:15,940 --> 00:08:18,010
ingredients together to the to having

179
00:08:18,010 --> 00:08:19,540
the equipment's needed to run the

180
00:08:19,540 --> 00:08:23,190
infrastructure that till it actually

181
00:08:23,190 --> 00:08:26,980
gives you the cooked pizza even you need

182
00:08:26,980 --> 00:08:28,720
to set the dining table that bridges

183
00:08:28,720 --> 00:08:31,270
everything you need to have you cannot

184
00:08:31,270 --> 00:08:34,210
rely on anywhere else so you might go to

185
00:08:34,210 --> 00:08:36,400
the extreme of actually growing your own

186
00:08:36,400 --> 00:08:39,909
tomato is milking your own cows and

187
00:08:39,909 --> 00:08:42,159
kneading your own dough which is

188
00:08:42,159 --> 00:08:44,380
actually true because for antrim eyes

189
00:08:44,380 --> 00:08:45,880
you need to have your own servers

190
00:08:45,880 --> 00:08:48,910
network infra if

191
00:08:48,910 --> 00:08:51,130
anything you need to have it from the

192
00:08:51,130 --> 00:08:53,530
scratch now when we say

193
00:08:53,530 --> 00:08:54,990
infrastructure-as-a-service

194
00:08:54,990 --> 00:08:57,400
we're taking from the cloud provider

195
00:08:57,400 --> 00:09:00,670
think it has a take and bake or you get

196
00:09:00,670 --> 00:09:03,910
it from the you get the frozen pizza so

197
00:09:03,910 --> 00:09:06,790
all you need need to worry about is the

198
00:09:06,790 --> 00:09:09,220
stuff needed to warm and serve the pizza

199
00:09:09,220 --> 00:09:12,520
because you just take it from the store

200
00:09:12,520 --> 00:09:18,250
and then just warm it and eat it and you

201
00:09:18,250 --> 00:09:20,680
do not you only need the hardware

202
00:09:20,680 --> 00:09:24,430
running the backend system everything

203
00:09:24,430 --> 00:09:26,860
would be yours so making sure that the

204
00:09:26,860 --> 00:09:29,140
server storage load balances Network and

205
00:09:29,140 --> 00:09:32,680
what all are actually needed is managed

206
00:09:32,680 --> 00:09:36,100
by someone in case of

207
00:09:36,100 --> 00:09:37,660
platform-as-a-service

208
00:09:37,660 --> 00:09:40,390
you don't even need to manage the

209
00:09:40,390 --> 00:09:43,570
underlying operating software or

210
00:09:43,570 --> 00:09:47,260
hardware so when we say take the example

211
00:09:47,260 --> 00:09:49,780
of pizza all you need to do is set the

212
00:09:49,780 --> 00:09:52,000
table because the pizza will be

213
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:53,770
delivered to you and you just have to

214
00:09:53,770 --> 00:09:56,980
eat it in this case an infrastructure

215
00:09:56,980 --> 00:09:59,070
and the platform will be taken care of

216
00:09:59,070 --> 00:10:03,490
by the vendor finally we end up with

217
00:10:03,490 --> 00:10:05,650
software as a service which is the

218
00:10:05,650 --> 00:10:09,280
service which I really like because you

219
00:10:09,280 --> 00:10:12,040
just dining out and enjoying a thin

220
00:10:12,040 --> 00:10:16,030
crust pizza and you would need to take

221
00:10:16,030 --> 00:10:19,450
care of the basic necessities like you

222
00:10:19,450 --> 00:10:21,670
have everything set up you just need to

223
00:10:21,670 --> 00:10:23,230
make sure that the credentials are right

224
00:10:23,230 --> 00:10:24,700
the credentials are being managed

225
00:10:24,700 --> 00:10:26,440
properly the people who are going to use

226
00:10:26,440 --> 00:10:29,260
it they have everything set up and they

227
00:10:29,260 --> 00:10:30,820
are going to use it they're the right

228
00:10:30,820 --> 00:10:33,660
people to use it

229
00:10:33,660 --> 00:10:37,060
no that's how my pizza looks like

230
00:10:37,060 --> 00:10:38,350
because I'm gonna be using it as

231
00:10:38,350 --> 00:10:40,780
infrastructure services or platform as a

232
00:10:40,780 --> 00:10:42,970
service or software as a service based

233
00:10:42,970 --> 00:10:45,730
on the requirement that I have so the

234
00:10:45,730 --> 00:10:47,260
first and foremost thing that I would

235
00:10:47,260 --> 00:10:49,150
think when I'm going to cloud us what

236
00:10:49,150 --> 00:10:53,860
exactly I need in the cloud it just

237
00:10:53,860 --> 00:10:56,530
doesn't it doesn't need to be where and

238
00:10:56,530 --> 00:10:58,540
I just one morning I wake up and say I

239
00:10:58,540 --> 00:10:59,950
need to move to the cloud because

240
00:10:59,950 --> 00:11:01,720
everyone is moving to the cloud that

241
00:11:01,720 --> 00:11:02,980
should never be the case

242
00:11:02,980 --> 00:11:05,050
you need to set your requirements right

243
00:11:05,050 --> 00:11:07,030
you need to document it you need to jot

244
00:11:07,030 --> 00:11:11,710
down the points that you need to you

245
00:11:11,710 --> 00:11:15,700
need to have to move to the cloud I've

246
00:11:15,700 --> 00:11:18,400
done few of the cloud service providers

247
00:11:18,400 --> 00:11:21,490
which are their IBM's like we have IBM

248
00:11:21,490 --> 00:11:24,250
cloud GCP which has glue keys cloud

249
00:11:24,250 --> 00:11:26,920
platform Amazon Web Services Microsoft

250
00:11:26,920 --> 00:11:30,850
Azure a many more Alibaba Red Hat

251
00:11:30,850 --> 00:11:34,150
there's a huge huge list so I just

252
00:11:34,150 --> 00:11:36,070
couldn't figure a few of them and just

253
00:11:36,070 --> 00:11:38,320
put it here which are like the most

254
00:11:38,320 --> 00:11:44,770
common ones which are in use I am moving

255
00:11:44,770 --> 00:11:46,750
on to the actual topic what are the

256
00:11:46,750 --> 00:11:49,030
general myths when we talk about clouds

257
00:11:49,030 --> 00:11:52,270
or security in the cloud

258
00:11:52,270 --> 00:11:54,640
people say cloud is more vulnerable to

259
00:11:54,640 --> 00:11:57,340
breaches that's one of the biggest

260
00:11:57,340 --> 00:12:00,120
misconceptions you hear about the cloud

261
00:12:00,120 --> 00:12:03,490
the data is safer within and even people

262
00:12:03,490 --> 00:12:05,170
say that the data is safer within the

263
00:12:05,170 --> 00:12:07,840
full four walls of an organization then

264
00:12:07,840 --> 00:12:09,840
in the hands of a cloud service provider

265
00:12:09,840 --> 00:12:13,210
however in reality there has been no

266
00:12:13,210 --> 00:12:15,280
evidence that indicates that the cloud

267
00:12:15,280 --> 00:12:17,650
service provider which is giving you the

268
00:12:17,650 --> 00:12:19,840
services have performed less securely

269
00:12:19,840 --> 00:12:23,280
than any other end-user organization

270
00:12:23,280 --> 00:12:26,110
according to Gartner security report

271
00:12:26,110 --> 00:12:28,300
which is a research firm the recent

272
00:12:28,300 --> 00:12:30,010
history of public clouds has

273
00:12:30,010 --> 00:12:32,400
demonstrated that the brand name and

274
00:12:32,400 --> 00:12:35,560
multi-talent services are not only

275
00:12:35,560 --> 00:12:40,120
highly resistant to attack but also are

276
00:12:40,120 --> 00:12:42,370
more secure starting point than the

277
00:12:42,370 --> 00:12:44,650
traditional in-house implementations

278
00:12:44,650 --> 00:12:47,050
that we do because in-house

279
00:12:47,050 --> 00:12:49,690
implementations we just plug the servers

280
00:12:49,690 --> 00:12:52,780
configure it there are certain ground

281
00:12:52,780 --> 00:12:55,540
rules that we just follow but in case of

282
00:12:55,540 --> 00:12:58,030
cloud service providers there are a lot

283
00:12:58,030 --> 00:13:00,430
of things that cloud service provider

284
00:13:00,430 --> 00:13:02,440
will be taking care of and then they'll

285
00:13:02,440 --> 00:13:04,480
tell you that these this is what we are

286
00:13:04,480 --> 00:13:05,980
going to manage and this is what you

287
00:13:05,980 --> 00:13:09,790
have to manage another thing we've heard

288
00:13:09,790 --> 00:13:12,760
all heard many times about the breach

289
00:13:12,760 --> 00:13:14,330
horror stories in the media

290
00:13:14,330 --> 00:13:16,010
that hackers getting credit card

291
00:13:16,010 --> 00:13:18,500
information Social Security numbers cell

292
00:13:18,500 --> 00:13:20,750
phone numbers but the these data

293
00:13:20,750 --> 00:13:23,060
breaches weren't because of the data was

294
00:13:23,060 --> 00:13:25,790
in the cloud they were due to the human

295
00:13:25,790 --> 00:13:30,260
error or negligence like not doing the

296
00:13:30,260 --> 00:13:32,030
regular software updates or security

297
00:13:32,030 --> 00:13:33,350
patches or not having the right

298
00:13:33,350 --> 00:13:36,560
configuration settings in the cloud rest

299
00:13:36,560 --> 00:13:39,050
assure without security providers of

300
00:13:39,050 --> 00:13:40,580
cloud providers are extremely serious

301
00:13:40,580 --> 00:13:43,190
about the security the major cloud

302
00:13:43,190 --> 00:13:45,350
providers like Microsoft Azure Amazon

303
00:13:45,350 --> 00:13:48,620
Web Services GCP IBM cloud have entire

304
00:13:48,620 --> 00:13:51,950
squad of security people are the people

305
00:13:51,950 --> 00:13:55,580
who work on the cloud dedicated 100% to

306
00:13:55,580 --> 00:13:58,340
the security think about it that these

307
00:13:58,340 --> 00:13:59,690
are the companies which are keeping your

308
00:13:59,690 --> 00:14:02,960
Google searches amador and many more

309
00:14:02,960 --> 00:14:07,610
things that are on the internet even I

310
00:14:07,610 --> 00:14:09,500
was reading one of the article were and

311
00:14:09,500 --> 00:14:10,850
it was written that Microsoft has a

312
00:14:10,850 --> 00:14:12,950
cyber defense Operations Center to give

313
00:14:12,950 --> 00:14:15,740
the companies around-the-clock access to

314
00:14:15,740 --> 00:14:17,180
whatever it needs to respond to the

315
00:14:17,180 --> 00:14:19,940
cyber threats in even the other security

316
00:14:19,940 --> 00:14:22,460
providers have done so much of research

317
00:14:22,460 --> 00:14:24,260
before actually providing the services

318
00:14:24,260 --> 00:14:26,810
it also actually they also make sure

319
00:14:26,810 --> 00:14:29,480
that you have this you have a protection

320
00:14:29,480 --> 00:14:31,820
for DDoS which is distribution

321
00:14:31,820 --> 00:14:34,390
distributed denial of service attack

322
00:14:34,390 --> 00:14:38,540
protection that analyzes traffic in real

323
00:14:38,540 --> 00:14:41,570
time and has the capability to respond

324
00:14:41,570 --> 00:14:46,550
and mitigated an attack within 90 90

325
00:14:46,550 --> 00:14:49,790
seconds of the attack or of the

326
00:14:49,790 --> 00:14:55,010
detection I should say so that's where

327
00:14:55,010 --> 00:14:58,250
and one of the myths which is the bunk

328
00:14:58,250 --> 00:15:00,170
that there are more breaches in the

329
00:15:00,170 --> 00:15:01,910
cloud we all have to make sure that we

330
00:15:01,910 --> 00:15:04,520
are having a configuration right we go

331
00:15:04,520 --> 00:15:06,740
through the contractual obligations that

332
00:15:06,740 --> 00:15:08,420
what are they going to do what are they

333
00:15:08,420 --> 00:15:10,280
going to give us it's our responsibility

334
00:15:10,280 --> 00:15:16,070
also apart from that also on this human

335
00:15:16,070 --> 00:15:18,500
error I want to say that accidents do

336
00:15:18,500 --> 00:15:21,440
happen so according to the recent were

337
00:15:21,440 --> 00:15:23,000
the recent survey which I was going

338
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:25,610
through 34 percent of the data lost in

339
00:15:25,610 --> 00:15:28,190
first half of 2018

340
00:15:28,190 --> 00:15:30,020
through breaches were actually caused

341
00:15:30,020 --> 00:15:34,280
because of the accidental loss and how

342
00:15:34,280 --> 00:15:36,770
about the third party how about the

343
00:15:36,770 --> 00:15:38,960
third party is whom we'll give access to

344
00:15:38,960 --> 00:15:42,380
the data we have cloud we have a we have

345
00:15:42,380 --> 00:15:44,240
given access to the clouds the third

346
00:15:44,240 --> 00:15:46,760
party service providers how about

347
00:15:46,760 --> 00:15:48,710
restricting their services or

348
00:15:48,710 --> 00:15:51,080
restricting their access to our services

349
00:15:51,080 --> 00:15:55,510
need to know basis need to have basis

350
00:15:55,510 --> 00:15:58,760
apart from that it's not just entirely

351
00:15:58,760 --> 00:16:02,030
trout provider responsibility to

352
00:16:02,030 --> 00:16:03,740
maintain the security it's actually a

353
00:16:03,740 --> 00:16:05,900
shared responsibility model which I'll

354
00:16:05,900 --> 00:16:09,230
be actually covering in detail less

355
00:16:09,230 --> 00:16:13,490
control over data this is not actually

356
00:16:13,490 --> 00:16:17,000
true it's not a big list they actually

357
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:22,130
give you the whole view on what data you

358
00:16:22,130 --> 00:16:23,930
were where exactly you're storing the

359
00:16:23,930 --> 00:16:27,380
data you are deciding it what security

360
00:16:27,380 --> 00:16:29,570
restrictions you should have in the

361
00:16:29,570 --> 00:16:31,660
cloud they give you the best practices

362
00:16:31,660 --> 00:16:34,730
on top of best practices you need to dis

363
00:16:34,730 --> 00:16:36,980
out you need to decide how you're gonna

364
00:16:36,980 --> 00:16:39,680
secure your own data if something

365
00:16:39,680 --> 00:16:41,720
happens who's gonna be ashamed you're

366
00:16:41,720 --> 00:16:43,520
gonna be a shame cloud security

367
00:16:43,520 --> 00:16:45,440
providers are giving you the services

368
00:16:45,440 --> 00:16:47,330
are giving you the security settings but

369
00:16:47,330 --> 00:16:50,240
then you need to be making sure that

370
00:16:50,240 --> 00:16:53,870
those are there even I've seen that the

371
00:16:53,870 --> 00:16:55,340
cloud providers are actually giving you

372
00:16:55,340 --> 00:16:56,990
the monitoring services to manage your

373
00:16:56,990 --> 00:17:00,260
own environment to actually monitor your

374
00:17:00,260 --> 00:17:04,220
own environment another thing I heard

375
00:17:04,220 --> 00:17:06,980
that a single tenant environment wherein

376
00:17:06,980 --> 00:17:09,020
it's only dedicated environment are more

377
00:17:09,020 --> 00:17:12,560
secure than the multi tenant but let me

378
00:17:12,560 --> 00:17:15,230
tell you that multi tenant systems offer

379
00:17:15,230 --> 00:17:17,540
two security benefits over single tenant

380
00:17:17,540 --> 00:17:19,849
systems they provide an additional layer

381
00:17:19,849 --> 00:17:22,520
of content protection and they ensure

382
00:17:22,520 --> 00:17:25,180
that the security patches are up-to-date

383
00:17:25,180 --> 00:17:27,230
because they are maintaining the

384
00:17:27,230 --> 00:17:29,840
services for multiple clients they are

385
00:17:29,840 --> 00:17:32,890
segregating the services while cloud

386
00:17:32,890 --> 00:17:36,170
hosted systems provide a hardware base

387
00:17:36,170 --> 00:17:39,740
and perimeter security those who choose

388
00:17:39,740 --> 00:17:42,110
a multi tenant solution get

389
00:17:42,110 --> 00:17:44,330
layer of protection called logical

390
00:17:44,330 --> 00:17:47,260
content isolation designated to help

391
00:17:47,260 --> 00:17:52,909
prevent insight parameters attacks this

392
00:17:52,909 --> 00:17:55,880
is like tenant in an apartment building

393
00:17:55,880 --> 00:17:57,980
who used one key to enter the building

394
00:17:57,980 --> 00:18:01,850
and another one to enter your individual

395
00:18:01,850 --> 00:18:04,519
apartments multi tenant systems uniquely

396
00:18:04,519 --> 00:18:07,279
actually require both perimeter and

397
00:18:07,279 --> 00:18:10,970
apartment level security apart from that

398
00:18:10,970 --> 00:18:13,850
there's another reverse myth where in

399
00:18:13,850 --> 00:18:16,760
multi tenant systems are more secure

400
00:18:16,760 --> 00:18:19,730
than the secure tenant there are

401
00:18:19,730 --> 00:18:22,700
absolutely no there are actually no

402
00:18:22,700 --> 00:18:25,159
absolutes in cloud security the complete

403
00:18:25,159 --> 00:18:28,130
opposite statement require cloud tenancy

404
00:18:28,130 --> 00:18:31,880
can also be viewed as a myth like it's

405
00:18:31,880 --> 00:18:34,789
vice versa it's you have to decide what

406
00:18:34,789 --> 00:18:37,010
you want you have to decide how much

407
00:18:37,010 --> 00:18:40,399
resources you want how much you want to

408
00:18:40,399 --> 00:18:43,100
pay what environment you want what kind

409
00:18:43,100 --> 00:18:45,559
of legal implications you have to go

410
00:18:45,559 --> 00:18:50,090
through another tricky thing when we say

411
00:18:50,090 --> 00:18:52,779
myths myths can actually be positive and

412
00:18:52,779 --> 00:18:56,090
negative positive in a way wherein you

413
00:18:56,090 --> 00:18:58,309
want to stick our organization wants to

414
00:18:58,309 --> 00:19:00,740
stick with the cloud service provider

415
00:19:00,740 --> 00:19:02,480
because these things they think it's

416
00:19:02,480 --> 00:19:04,760
more safer to be with one cloud provider

417
00:19:04,760 --> 00:19:09,380
and a negative in a way wherein you say

418
00:19:09,380 --> 00:19:11,330
that I don't want to use a cloud if my

419
00:19:11,330 --> 00:19:13,610
data is gonna be really really unsafe

420
00:19:13,610 --> 00:19:17,510
and on the same lines a cloud so a

421
00:19:17,510 --> 00:19:20,690
person who is actually leveraging the

422
00:19:20,690 --> 00:19:23,299
services from the cloud says I have

423
00:19:23,299 --> 00:19:26,389
access to unlimited resources it may

424
00:19:26,389 --> 00:19:29,389
appear that your cloud server or cloud

425
00:19:29,389 --> 00:19:31,220
service provider has actually given you

426
00:19:31,220 --> 00:19:33,500
unlimited memory and processing power

427
00:19:33,500 --> 00:19:35,750
because you're in the cloud but that

428
00:19:35,750 --> 00:19:37,070
doesn't mean that you're not gonna be

429
00:19:37,070 --> 00:19:37,960
charged for it

430
00:19:37,960 --> 00:19:39,889
consuming more than you need can

431
00:19:39,889 --> 00:19:42,740
actually lead to dramatic price increase

432
00:19:42,740 --> 00:19:45,440
which you which you've been hearing from

433
00:19:45,440 --> 00:19:48,470
a while the I left my the service

434
00:19:48,470 --> 00:19:49,789
running and that I have got a bill of

435
00:19:49,789 --> 00:19:54,530
huge so many dollars so clouds

436
00:19:54,530 --> 00:19:57,230
was half processors memory input/output

437
00:19:57,230 --> 00:19:59,750
limitations to normally define when the

438
00:19:59,750 --> 00:20:02,030
request is made so if you need this much

439
00:20:02,030 --> 00:20:04,700
you'll be getting this much in only that

440
00:20:04,700 --> 00:20:07,250
much and if you if you actually want to

441
00:20:07,250 --> 00:20:10,810
extend cloud do provide the scalability

442
00:20:10,810 --> 00:20:14,980
then you're gonna be paying for it and

443
00:20:14,980 --> 00:20:18,050
apart from that people say it's all just

444
00:20:18,050 --> 00:20:20,450
about another set of people say their

445
00:20:20,450 --> 00:20:23,030
thought about expensive services this

446
00:20:23,030 --> 00:20:26,090
line of thought actually because there

447
00:20:26,090 --> 00:20:28,040
are custom solution calls for a level of

448
00:20:28,040 --> 00:20:30,740
specialization needs attention if a

449
00:20:30,740 --> 00:20:33,260
business must suddenly expand its

450
00:20:33,260 --> 00:20:36,890
storage for a new project or example for

451
00:20:36,890 --> 00:20:40,130
sale purpose like lot of retail service

452
00:20:40,130 --> 00:20:43,580
providers they they mean huge amount of

453
00:20:43,580 --> 00:20:46,670
resources when they need to scale up at

454
00:20:46,670 --> 00:20:49,010
the time of sale how is the best

455
00:20:49,010 --> 00:20:51,800
solution if you have something in house

456
00:20:51,800 --> 00:20:54,290
you cannot have like 10 servers by 10

457
00:20:54,290 --> 00:20:57,260
servers implemented and the sale after

458
00:20:57,260 --> 00:21:01,190
the same you they're off no use so the

459
00:21:01,190 --> 00:21:04,400
best time for using the cloud is at the

460
00:21:04,400 --> 00:21:06,230
time of sale that's what I feel like you

461
00:21:06,230 --> 00:21:09,800
just go on and on and on and then as

462
00:21:09,800 --> 00:21:12,830
soon as your use is done you can cut

463
00:21:12,830 --> 00:21:17,240
down the cut down the service usage so

464
00:21:17,240 --> 00:21:19,550
there are multiple pricing models also

465
00:21:19,550 --> 00:21:22,480
which you can opt for another

466
00:21:22,480 --> 00:21:26,600
interesting myth that when I had a word

467
00:21:26,600 --> 00:21:28,370
with few of the researchers and the

468
00:21:28,370 --> 00:21:30,890
people around me that security actually

469
00:21:30,890 --> 00:21:32,570
stole closed down the performance of the

470
00:21:32,570 --> 00:21:36,320
flower clearly protecting the data is

471
00:21:36,320 --> 00:21:39,680
very essential if till now we don't know

472
00:21:39,680 --> 00:21:43,610
we have seen the the big big breaches of

473
00:21:43,610 --> 00:21:46,520
the history in the recent of couple of

474
00:21:46,520 --> 00:21:49,430
years so the simplest solution would

475
00:21:49,430 --> 00:21:52,250
seem to be encrypt the data at all but

476
00:21:52,250 --> 00:21:55,540
is that going to solve all the problems

477
00:21:55,540 --> 00:21:58,400
there are two challenges to it the first

478
00:21:58,400 --> 00:22:01,820
is where performance comes in when your

479
00:22:01,820 --> 00:22:04,610
data storage or the huge amount of data

480
00:22:04,610 --> 00:22:07,310
that you have in place

481
00:22:07,310 --> 00:22:09,890
is protected as a whole the constant

482
00:22:09,890 --> 00:22:12,170
encryption and decryption of huge data

483
00:22:12,170 --> 00:22:14,360
chunks tend to slow down the performance

484
00:22:14,360 --> 00:22:18,020
plus encryption only protects the data

485
00:22:18,020 --> 00:22:21,410
as rest data is encrypted as it travels

486
00:22:21,410 --> 00:22:23,720
between or is used by the application

487
00:22:23,720 --> 00:22:26,300
leave it actually exposed to breach so

488
00:22:26,300 --> 00:22:27,580
you have to make sure when the data is

489
00:22:27,580 --> 00:22:30,410
traveling that actually travels to a

490
00:22:30,410 --> 00:22:33,250
secure Channel

491
00:22:34,030 --> 00:22:37,430
apart from that a very very interesting

492
00:22:37,430 --> 00:22:41,210
thing that multi-cloud solves vendor

493
00:22:41,210 --> 00:22:43,520
lock-in and other management challenges

494
00:22:43,520 --> 00:22:46,340
which I feel is actually very important

495
00:22:46,340 --> 00:22:51,610
because if you have deployed your data

496
00:22:51,610 --> 00:22:57,230
in only one provider and what if the

497
00:22:57,230 --> 00:22:58,760
vendor says that I'm running out of my

498
00:22:58,760 --> 00:22:59,930
business and I'm gonna shut down

499
00:22:59,930 --> 00:23:03,100
everything I go into question about it

500
00:23:03,100 --> 00:23:06,320
you might but then what can you do Bob

501
00:23:06,320 --> 00:23:07,370
do about it

502
00:23:07,370 --> 00:23:10,160
on paper it makes sense that yes they

503
00:23:10,160 --> 00:23:11,990
are going out of the services and they

504
00:23:11,990 --> 00:23:13,400
cannot do much but how about your

505
00:23:13,400 --> 00:23:20,000
business so in the same case many

506
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:21,920
enterprises actually believe if the

507
00:23:21,920 --> 00:23:24,110
hedge deployments across multiple clouds

508
00:23:24,110 --> 00:23:28,880
they avoid vendor lock-in their belief

509
00:23:28,880 --> 00:23:30,500
is actually permitted by several

510
00:23:30,500 --> 00:23:32,000
third-party software vendors and

511
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:34,240
consulting firms and the researchers

512
00:23:34,240 --> 00:23:38,090
they have seen there are multiple

513
00:23:38,090 --> 00:23:41,800
challenges they might face and like

514
00:23:41,800 --> 00:23:46,220
security compliance cost management also

515
00:23:46,220 --> 00:23:48,830
that one of the services working in one

516
00:23:48,830 --> 00:23:50,900
of the cloud and the other is working in

517
00:23:50,900 --> 00:23:53,420
the other so you have to bake it

518
00:23:53,420 --> 00:23:55,750
accordingly that what exactly you need

519
00:23:55,750 --> 00:23:58,760
for your environment and whether you

520
00:23:58,760 --> 00:24:01,040
need a multi a cloud environment or you

521
00:24:01,040 --> 00:24:07,580
need one single cloud provider now while

522
00:24:07,580 --> 00:24:09,800
I was talking about the shared security

523
00:24:09,800 --> 00:24:12,170
model this is actually the flipside of

524
00:24:12,170 --> 00:24:14,960
the shared responsibility model wherein

525
00:24:14,960 --> 00:24:17,840
the myth goes if I trust the cloud to be

526
00:24:17,840 --> 00:24:20,960
secure once I set up the cloud I'm done

527
00:24:20,960 --> 00:24:22,730
like I set up everything in the cloud

528
00:24:22,730 --> 00:24:25,430
and I'm done the catch off course is

529
00:24:25,430 --> 00:24:27,740
there is that the public cloud provider

530
00:24:27,740 --> 00:24:29,630
is only responsible for securing their

531
00:24:29,630 --> 00:24:33,140
infrastructure you are responsible for

532
00:24:33,140 --> 00:24:35,660
securing your own data and applications

533
00:24:35,660 --> 00:24:40,070
stored in the crowd the recent examples

534
00:24:40,070 --> 00:24:42,760
of the breaches if I say that you have

535
00:24:42,760 --> 00:24:45,320
you have stored your data in one of the

536
00:24:45,320 --> 00:24:48,530
repository and you made it public who's

537
00:24:48,530 --> 00:24:50,510
gonna be responsible for it you have

538
00:24:50,510 --> 00:24:53,420
made your report a repository or repo

539
00:24:53,420 --> 00:24:56,360
public they given you the repo to store

540
00:24:56,360 --> 00:24:57,950
the data but you have to make the right

541
00:24:57,950 --> 00:24:59,780
you have to make the right settings you

542
00:24:59,780 --> 00:25:01,700
have to make the right choices or the

543
00:25:01,700 --> 00:25:04,580
security settings that this is how I am

544
00:25:04,580 --> 00:25:07,910
gonna secure my own data the cloud

545
00:25:07,910 --> 00:25:10,790
providers will actually secure what deep

546
00:25:10,790 --> 00:25:13,190
void but what you put is your

547
00:25:13,190 --> 00:25:15,770
responsibility cyber criminals are

548
00:25:15,770 --> 00:25:18,590
actually targeting your applications and

549
00:25:18,590 --> 00:25:21,800
the stolen credentials you need the

550
00:25:21,800 --> 00:25:23,990
ability to identify you need to have the

551
00:25:23,990 --> 00:25:28,660
ability to figure out those treads who

552
00:25:28,660 --> 00:25:31,160
control who is going to access your own

553
00:25:31,160 --> 00:25:33,680
system sometimes the internal sources

554
00:25:33,680 --> 00:25:36,140
itself are like creating a lot of issues

555
00:25:36,140 --> 00:25:38,990
there was one recent breach which I

556
00:25:38,990 --> 00:25:42,080
heard which I read actually about that

557
00:25:42,080 --> 00:25:46,130
there were a lot of slack keys were put

558
00:25:46,130 --> 00:25:48,830
in on what put in on the github of

559
00:25:48,830 --> 00:25:52,270
another organization when researchers

560
00:25:52,270 --> 00:25:55,340
tried to see what those keys are they

561
00:25:55,340 --> 00:25:56,840
were actually able to log into the

562
00:25:56,840 --> 00:26:00,260
development slack the slack of the

563
00:26:00,260 --> 00:26:04,430
developers environment and they were

564
00:26:04,430 --> 00:26:06,380
able to see what the chat they are

565
00:26:06,380 --> 00:26:08,180
because when you talk about slack the

566
00:26:08,180 --> 00:26:10,940
reader stays on for the time that you

567
00:26:10,940 --> 00:26:13,340
want or tell that I'm you delete it so

568
00:26:13,340 --> 00:26:15,620
the vulnerability the bug was actually

569
00:26:15,620 --> 00:26:18,470
reported to the organization once there

570
00:26:18,470 --> 00:26:21,260
replicated the issue was fixed and it

571
00:26:21,260 --> 00:26:23,230
was through the responsible disclosure

572
00:26:23,230 --> 00:26:25,580
the vulnerability is fixed but then

573
00:26:25,580 --> 00:26:28,670
these vulnerabilities do exist how about

574
00:26:28,670 --> 00:26:31,460
having your own credentials at the

575
00:26:31,460 --> 00:26:33,590
github or a public repo or on a public

576
00:26:33,590 --> 00:26:34,700
blog

577
00:26:34,700 --> 00:26:38,090
it's like I have everything I have a

578
00:26:38,090 --> 00:26:39,980
house with all the doors window is

579
00:26:39,980 --> 00:26:43,489
perhaps an alarm you have all the tools

580
00:26:43,489 --> 00:26:45,259
but you still have to lock your door

581
00:26:45,259 --> 00:26:49,340
close the windows set the alarm so you

582
00:26:49,340 --> 00:26:51,559
have to practice good security hygiene

583
00:26:51,559 --> 00:26:55,039
cybersecurity hygiene and the cloud is

584
00:26:55,039 --> 00:26:57,830
no more secure then you make it so you

585
00:26:57,830 --> 00:27:04,029
have your own responsibilities moving on

586
00:27:04,029 --> 00:27:06,499
people say the security is same for all

587
00:27:06,499 --> 00:27:08,960
the users it's actually the general

588
00:27:08,960 --> 00:27:10,909
misunderstanding that all type of

589
00:27:10,909 --> 00:27:12,559
flowers are essentially the same

590
00:27:12,559 --> 00:27:16,489
many observes that or assume that if a

591
00:27:16,489 --> 00:27:18,590
standard cloud offers one level of

592
00:27:18,590 --> 00:27:21,710
security to plow clients a personalised

593
00:27:21,710 --> 00:27:24,049
cloud a cloud can't be any different a

594
00:27:24,049 --> 00:27:26,950
user she securely actually cannot

595
00:27:26,950 --> 00:27:29,869
request security configuration changes

596
00:27:29,869 --> 00:27:34,850
and if I say that you don't have you

597
00:27:34,850 --> 00:27:37,090
just have root credentials or admin

598
00:27:37,090 --> 00:27:41,899
access given to everyone are you going

599
00:27:41,899 --> 00:27:45,440
to have a secure environment no you need

600
00:27:45,440 --> 00:27:47,600
to have your services running with

601
00:27:47,600 --> 00:27:49,820
certain privileges which actually is

602
00:27:49,820 --> 00:27:52,609
required by those services you need to

603
00:27:52,609 --> 00:27:54,409
have proper policies you need to have

604
00:27:54,409 --> 00:27:57,169
proper rules in place then you need to

605
00:27:57,169 --> 00:27:59,299
have assigned groups who's going to

606
00:27:59,299 --> 00:28:01,730
who's going to be a grad min who's gonna

607
00:28:01,730 --> 00:28:05,899
be a super admin who's gonna be a person

608
00:28:05,899 --> 00:28:07,609
who's just gonna be managing certain

609
00:28:07,609 --> 00:28:10,429
services between the administrator and

610
00:28:10,429 --> 00:28:11,539
the normal user

611
00:28:11,539 --> 00:28:14,090
you can't give access to everyone anyone

612
00:28:14,090 --> 00:28:17,830
and everyone there was a recent report

613
00:28:17,830 --> 00:28:20,869
where an IT security professional says

614
00:28:20,869 --> 00:28:24,980
that cloud security concern the main

615
00:28:24,980 --> 00:28:26,389
security concern is the MIS

616
00:28:26,389 --> 00:28:31,340
configuration of the platform and croute

617
00:28:31,340 --> 00:28:33,169
personalization can actually help

618
00:28:33,169 --> 00:28:38,480
overcome the overcome that worry now I'm

619
00:28:38,480 --> 00:28:41,570
moving on to an interesting section

620
00:28:41,570 --> 00:28:43,659
where and I'm gonna be talking about a

621
00:28:43,659 --> 00:28:46,310
developer bet or

622
00:28:46,310 --> 00:28:48,710
we talk about deaths a corpse developer

623
00:28:48,710 --> 00:28:50,360
operations and IP myths

624
00:28:50,360 --> 00:28:53,090
it's my perspective and the the research

625
00:28:53,090 --> 00:28:55,070
that I have done the understanding that

626
00:28:55,070 --> 00:28:58,100
I have got some other person can have a

627
00:28:58,100 --> 00:28:59,990
different myth it's it's it's a

628
00:28:59,990 --> 00:29:01,930
debatable topic to be honest because

629
00:29:01,930 --> 00:29:04,670
when I was researching for the topic

630
00:29:04,670 --> 00:29:08,660
some person said that this is a this is

631
00:29:08,660 --> 00:29:11,120
I think that the I believe that this is

632
00:29:11,120 --> 00:29:13,430
the right thing the other person said no

633
00:29:13,430 --> 00:29:15,680
this is not the right thing so every

634
00:29:15,680 --> 00:29:18,230
person has their own perception if you

635
00:29:18,230 --> 00:29:20,270
want to have discussion we can do it

636
00:29:20,270 --> 00:29:22,820
after the session or you can reach out

637
00:29:22,820 --> 00:29:24,920
to me but I'm going to be talking about

638
00:29:24,920 --> 00:29:28,060
my understanding about this topic so

639
00:29:28,060 --> 00:29:31,520
just because my cloud environment is

640
00:29:31,520 --> 00:29:33,770
secure that means my application is

641
00:29:33,770 --> 00:29:36,380
secure I can trust my cloud security

642
00:29:36,380 --> 00:29:38,270
provider to say that they are very

643
00:29:38,270 --> 00:29:40,160
secure but the developers need to

644
00:29:40,160 --> 00:29:42,950
validate based on their requirement what

645
00:29:42,950 --> 00:29:44,900
they're putting onto the cloud what they

646
00:29:44,900 --> 00:29:47,150
are pushing on to the cloud or the

647
00:29:47,150 --> 00:29:48,710
operations scene what they are putting

648
00:29:48,710 --> 00:29:53,780
on the cloud my cloud as a developer I'm

649
00:29:53,780 --> 00:29:55,880
saying that my cloud cloud is doing all

650
00:29:55,880 --> 00:29:57,920
my security that doesn't mean they're

651
00:29:57,920 --> 00:29:59,870
doing they're securing all my

652
00:29:59,870 --> 00:30:03,020
applications which are there in this in

653
00:30:03,020 --> 00:30:07,580
the cloud environment you have to be you

654
00:30:07,580 --> 00:30:09,980
have to have a really great hygiene to

655
00:30:09,980 --> 00:30:13,460
be in the cloud some Wender actually

656
00:30:13,460 --> 00:30:15,320
practice car washing the tendency to

657
00:30:15,320 --> 00:30:19,270
call things cloud whether they're or not

658
00:30:19,270 --> 00:30:22,190
while some cloud washing is accidental

659
00:30:22,190 --> 00:30:25,370
and a result of legitimate confusion we

660
00:30:25,370 --> 00:30:28,690
also see that I am the IT organizations

661
00:30:28,690 --> 00:30:31,580
called many things cloud as part of

662
00:30:31,580 --> 00:30:34,160
their efforts to gain funding and me

663
00:30:34,160 --> 00:30:39,280
numerous or cloud demands and strategies

664
00:30:39,280 --> 00:30:43,160
apart from that there's one thing that I

665
00:30:43,160 --> 00:30:46,520
heard from one of my own that containers

666
00:30:46,520 --> 00:30:49,270
always is one T cloud deployments

667
00:30:49,270 --> 00:30:52,520
containers and kubernetes clusters can

668
00:30:52,520 --> 00:30:54,560
make it easier to migrate applications

669
00:30:54,560 --> 00:30:57,410
across clouds and even many executives

670
00:30:57,410 --> 00:31:00,029
believe that these abstractions win

671
00:31:00,029 --> 00:31:03,929
enable them to then to have multi-cloud

672
00:31:03,929 --> 00:31:07,440
ready but the harsh reality is that not

673
00:31:07,440 --> 00:31:10,679
every workload can or should be

674
00:31:10,679 --> 00:31:14,969
containerized the further away a Legacy

675
00:31:14,969 --> 00:31:20,029
workload is is from actually a whole

676
00:31:20,029 --> 00:31:23,190
less likely it could run in the

677
00:31:23,190 --> 00:31:25,619
production or a container you don't know

678
00:31:25,619 --> 00:31:27,809
whether your legacy environment is gonna

679
00:31:27,809 --> 00:31:29,849
work in a container or not you have to

680
00:31:29,849 --> 00:31:33,479
test it only consider multi-cloud in the

681
00:31:33,479 --> 00:31:36,059
context of SAS or a policy based

682
00:31:36,059 --> 00:31:39,419
strategy or cloud strategy that separate

683
00:31:39,419 --> 00:31:42,119
workloads across cloud platforms such as

684
00:31:42,119 --> 00:31:45,809
a machine learning AWS for deployment

685
00:31:45,809 --> 00:31:47,700
and as you referred dortmund

686
00:31:47,700 --> 00:31:50,460
applications so enterprise best realize

687
00:31:50,460 --> 00:31:52,649
their benefits the benefits of cloud

688
00:31:52,649 --> 00:31:55,289
then they go deep dive on a particular

689
00:31:55,289 --> 00:31:57,509
platform and use its native services so

690
00:31:57,509 --> 00:32:00,210
you have to decide or the developers

691
00:32:00,210 --> 00:32:02,299
have to come up with their own feedback

692
00:32:02,299 --> 00:32:04,919
what exactly is gonna best suit them

693
00:32:04,919 --> 00:32:07,379
which cloud is gonna suit them because

694
00:32:07,379 --> 00:32:08,909
they are the ones who's gonna we're

695
00:32:08,909 --> 00:32:14,339
gonna be working on it and they they

696
00:32:14,339 --> 00:32:16,859
have their own misconceptions about few

697
00:32:16,859 --> 00:32:18,749
of the things which once the deep dive

698
00:32:18,749 --> 00:32:20,929
it's gonna come out

699
00:32:20,929 --> 00:32:25,409
another myth we're in DevOps teams turn

700
00:32:25,409 --> 00:32:27,059
to the public cloud because they cannot

701
00:32:27,059 --> 00:32:29,580
afford to wait the league is earned they

702
00:32:29,580 --> 00:32:31,349
cannot afford to wait for the legacy

703
00:32:31,349 --> 00:32:35,789
purchasing and deployment processes so

704
00:32:35,789 --> 00:32:40,169
this accelerated time to market but it

705
00:32:40,169 --> 00:32:42,269
also may have introduced security gaps

706
00:32:42,269 --> 00:32:43,589
because you're moving from a legacy

707
00:32:43,589 --> 00:32:46,940
environment to the cloud you did not

708
00:32:46,940 --> 00:32:50,070
measure the security concerns which

709
00:32:50,070 --> 00:32:51,839
might be there and cloud your thinking

710
00:32:51,839 --> 00:32:54,629
that whatever I have an in-house whether

711
00:32:54,629 --> 00:32:56,249
my legacy system is going to be the same

712
00:32:56,249 --> 00:32:59,190
but there are security things that you

713
00:32:59,190 --> 00:33:01,379
have to maintain we have seen with

714
00:33:01,379 --> 00:33:03,119
devstack ops that security should be

715
00:33:03,119 --> 00:33:05,700
part of everything it's not just the

716
00:33:05,700 --> 00:33:07,529
security it has to be part of their ft

717
00:33:07,529 --> 00:33:10,559
operations team embedded in the whole

718
00:33:10,559 --> 00:33:12,720
development approaches whether in cloud

719
00:33:12,720 --> 00:33:13,650
or on

720
00:33:13,650 --> 00:33:16,650
mice the key is to treat security as a

721
00:33:16,650 --> 00:33:19,680
feature it's like you have to have in

722
00:33:19,680 --> 00:33:23,100
every sprint but the merit is that that

723
00:33:23,100 --> 00:33:25,050
you cannot do rapid deployments and

724
00:33:25,050 --> 00:33:27,780
security in the cloud so reality is that

725
00:33:27,780 --> 00:33:29,940
the cloud is actually an enabling

726
00:33:29,940 --> 00:33:35,010
technology for their sake ops apart from

727
00:33:35,010 --> 00:33:37,230
that a lot of people still believe the

728
00:33:37,230 --> 00:33:39,630
cloud applications are this there are a

729
00:33:39,630 --> 00:33:41,490
lot of people who working on this model

730
00:33:41,490 --> 00:33:43,170
still believe that the cloud

731
00:33:43,170 --> 00:33:45,750
applications and services are relatively

732
00:33:45,750 --> 00:33:50,520
no new but they are actually not new the

733
00:33:50,520 --> 00:33:52,050
cloud has been around for a really

734
00:33:52,050 --> 00:33:53,400
really long time

735
00:33:53,400 --> 00:33:55,770
the concept began in like nineteen

736
00:33:55,770 --> 00:34:00,780
fifties so we need to understand what we

737
00:34:00,780 --> 00:34:04,410
really want in our environment cloud

738
00:34:04,410 --> 00:34:06,330
security actually firewalls both

739
00:34:06,330 --> 00:34:08,790
internal and external environment or a

740
00:34:08,790 --> 00:34:11,219
network but by creating additional

741
00:34:11,219 --> 00:34:13,230
layers of security the external network

742
00:34:13,230 --> 00:34:15,690
is safe from malware that the users

743
00:34:15,690 --> 00:34:18,719
might download unintentionally similarly

744
00:34:18,719 --> 00:34:20,639
the firewall also prevents the internal

745
00:34:20,639 --> 00:34:23,250
network from being compromised in the

746
00:34:23,250 --> 00:34:28,110
event of external threats the cloud

747
00:34:28,110 --> 00:34:31,230
security is unsafe is probably the

748
00:34:31,230 --> 00:34:36,810
biggest myth but refuses to die and the

749
00:34:36,810 --> 00:34:39,929
developers are actually helping so to

750
00:34:39,929 --> 00:34:42,899
overcome that so recently I attended one

751
00:34:42,899 --> 00:34:44,550
of the conferences which was actually a

752
00:34:44,550 --> 00:34:46,320
developer conference this was my first

753
00:34:46,320 --> 00:34:50,520
ever developer conferences and when when

754
00:34:50,520 --> 00:34:52,560
we started discussing about this whole

755
00:34:52,560 --> 00:34:55,290
cloud deployment model and DEF set off

756
00:34:55,290 --> 00:34:58,800
scene they they came lot of points

757
00:34:58,800 --> 00:35:02,670
wherein they know the pain point even

758
00:35:02,670 --> 00:35:05,220
they have a solution but sometimes those

759
00:35:05,220 --> 00:35:07,550
solutions don't come at the table

760
00:35:07,550 --> 00:35:10,290
because they're not being processed

761
00:35:10,290 --> 00:35:14,040
properly now are people the security

762
00:35:14,040 --> 00:35:16,380
teams and the operations team all have

763
00:35:16,380 --> 00:35:20,580
to come together and talk about what's

764
00:35:20,580 --> 00:35:24,660
in their in-house and what we can have

765
00:35:24,660 --> 00:35:27,480
in the cloud without taking

766
00:35:27,480 --> 00:35:28,859
developers and operations team

767
00:35:28,859 --> 00:35:31,770
consideration and their inputs we can

768
00:35:31,770 --> 00:35:33,690
never have a safe environment beat

769
00:35:33,690 --> 00:35:37,500
in-house be it in the cloud moving on to

770
00:35:37,500 --> 00:35:41,369
the cloud the myths which I see so my

771
00:35:41,369 --> 00:35:46,910
Tao or have any cybersecurity or

772
00:35:46,910 --> 00:35:49,710
business leader who says their

773
00:35:49,710 --> 00:35:51,720
environment or organization can't use

774
00:35:51,720 --> 00:35:53,609
public cloud because of security or data

775
00:35:53,609 --> 00:35:57,300
privacy risk is probably because they

776
00:35:57,300 --> 00:35:59,850
are already deeply immersed in public

777
00:35:59,850 --> 00:36:02,220
cloud with some of their most important

778
00:36:02,220 --> 00:36:07,530
data and application or they have seen

779
00:36:07,530 --> 00:36:09,660
that there are a lot of risks in public

780
00:36:09,660 --> 00:36:11,700
cloud but they did not they could not do

781
00:36:11,700 --> 00:36:14,690
much of a deep dive and research into it

782
00:36:14,690 --> 00:36:18,210
another myth well once we're set up in

783
00:36:18,210 --> 00:36:20,760
the cloud we're done that was one of the

784
00:36:20,760 --> 00:36:24,900
recent I just mentioned in earlier sites

785
00:36:24,900 --> 00:36:27,660
leader actually leaders need to have

786
00:36:27,660 --> 00:36:31,380
cloud security mindset people are

787
00:36:31,380 --> 00:36:33,480
working on it development team security

788
00:36:33,480 --> 00:36:34,920
team operation see if everyone is

789
00:36:34,920 --> 00:36:37,200
working on it but then leaders also have

790
00:36:37,200 --> 00:36:39,600
to evolve with it cloud providers are

791
00:36:39,600 --> 00:36:42,180
making changes and you'll be make you'll

792
00:36:42,180 --> 00:36:43,770
also be making changes to your own

793
00:36:43,770 --> 00:36:45,480
software your own environment

794
00:36:45,480 --> 00:36:48,150
you'll be see you'll also manage who

795
00:36:48,150 --> 00:36:49,619
will be accessing the data people will

796
00:36:49,619 --> 00:36:51,869
be leaving the organization coming in

797
00:36:51,869 --> 00:36:54,480
who to have access to threat environment

798
00:36:54,480 --> 00:36:57,150
changes to one of the most common

799
00:36:57,150 --> 00:36:59,550
vulnerabilities is that the people get

800
00:36:59,550 --> 00:37:02,820
complacent what you may think is secure

801
00:37:02,820 --> 00:37:06,180
today could change the very next day the

802
00:37:06,180 --> 00:37:08,970
compliance requirements actually one of

803
00:37:08,970 --> 00:37:10,980
the reasons to use public cloud is

804
00:37:10,980 --> 00:37:13,619
because meeting compliance and data

805
00:37:13,619 --> 00:37:16,109
severity requirements can be a lot less

806
00:37:16,109 --> 00:37:19,830
complex cloud providers have more tools

807
00:37:19,830 --> 00:37:21,510
and capabilities to check and measure

808
00:37:21,510 --> 00:37:23,850
what's going on in the environment then

809
00:37:23,850 --> 00:37:25,859
you might think that they have it's just

810
00:37:25,859 --> 00:37:28,109
that you need to have research then what

811
00:37:28,109 --> 00:37:31,700
they have and how best I can use that

812
00:37:31,700 --> 00:37:34,440
apart from that it's not a mission

813
00:37:34,440 --> 00:37:38,369
mission-critical use cloud computing is

814
00:37:38,369 --> 00:37:39,350
a

815
00:37:39,350 --> 00:37:41,930
around the same lines cloud computing or

816
00:37:41,930 --> 00:37:45,950
cloud security is nothing at all or you

817
00:37:45,950 --> 00:37:50,990
might use it the completely so the

818
00:37:50,990 --> 00:37:52,790
mission-critical can mean different

819
00:37:52,790 --> 00:37:55,910
things to different people to a seesaw

820
00:37:55,910 --> 00:37:58,760
it means the complex systems or the

821
00:37:58,760 --> 00:38:00,620
approaches such as taking a phase

822
00:38:00,620 --> 00:38:02,720
approach can ease the movement to the

823
00:38:02,720 --> 00:38:07,280
cloud so the same lines hybrid solutions

824
00:38:07,280 --> 00:38:10,360
actually play a very very key role and

825
00:38:10,360 --> 00:38:13,430
for the security mindset we need to have

826
00:38:13,430 --> 00:38:16,070
always a phased approach a proper

827
00:38:16,070 --> 00:38:18,200
approach knowing the environment well

828
00:38:18,200 --> 00:38:20,570
without knowing your environment this is

829
00:38:20,570 --> 00:38:22,220
one thing which I actually emphasize

830
00:38:22,220 --> 00:38:24,200
that knowing your architecture is very

831
00:38:24,200 --> 00:38:27,260
very very important without knowing your

832
00:38:27,260 --> 00:38:29,630
own environment you cannot go ahead and

833
00:38:29,630 --> 00:38:35,330
then comes the CEO and picture seals are

834
00:38:35,330 --> 00:38:37,700
actually charged with leading all the

835
00:38:37,700 --> 00:38:40,250
strategy decisions strategy planning and

836
00:38:40,250 --> 00:38:44,900
operations for their companies it's a

837
00:38:44,900 --> 00:38:47,270
lot to be responsible for so they are

838
00:38:47,270 --> 00:38:48,260
actually forgiving

839
00:38:48,260 --> 00:38:50,660
sometimes forgiven for their mistakenly

840
00:38:50,660 --> 00:38:53,090
believing that they and the bright and

841
00:38:53,090 --> 00:38:55,100
capable people they put in charge of the

842
00:38:55,100 --> 00:38:56,630
IT security are doing the right things

843
00:38:56,630 --> 00:38:58,520
in the right places again the rights

844
00:38:58,520 --> 00:39:02,660
tests then in fact they are just wasting

845
00:39:02,660 --> 00:39:04,940
our large amount of for their IT

846
00:39:04,940 --> 00:39:07,010
security budget on things that rarely

847
00:39:07,010 --> 00:39:09,740
don't work so they have to have a

848
00:39:09,740 --> 00:39:12,680
complete understanding a roundtable

849
00:39:12,680 --> 00:39:16,970
discussion what how we can have a safe

850
00:39:16,970 --> 00:39:23,810
environment apart from that the the

851
00:39:23,810 --> 00:39:27,140
seals think or the people who are who

852
00:39:27,140 --> 00:39:28,130
are going to the cloud

853
00:39:28,130 --> 00:39:31,430
think that the big providers are

854
00:39:31,430 --> 00:39:34,010
actually making sure that my data is

855
00:39:34,010 --> 00:39:37,160
secure that might not be the case most

856
00:39:37,160 --> 00:39:39,500
computer defenses are so weak and

857
00:39:39,500 --> 00:39:42,410
ill-advised that the hackers and the

858
00:39:42,410 --> 00:39:44,870
malware can break into them at any point

859
00:39:44,870 --> 00:39:47,540
of time and that's only if the malicious

860
00:39:47,540 --> 00:39:50,390
intruders haven't already pawned the

861
00:39:50,390 --> 00:39:52,430
entire environment and been in for like

862
00:39:52,430 --> 00:39:55,460
few years if they have heard about the

863
00:39:55,460 --> 00:39:57,680
recent breaches where and the malware

864
00:39:57,680 --> 00:39:59,450
ins or the hackers were there in the

865
00:39:59,450 --> 00:40:00,950
system for like two years three years

866
00:40:00,950 --> 00:40:03,740
those are just the recent breaches when

867
00:40:03,740 --> 00:40:06,310
everybody knows that their environment

868
00:40:06,310 --> 00:40:10,460
security is so much important still

869
00:40:10,460 --> 00:40:12,380
there are a lot of companies or

870
00:40:12,380 --> 00:40:14,360
organization their computers defenses

871
00:40:14,360 --> 00:40:18,140
are so bad and for us that CEOs have

872
00:40:18,140 --> 00:40:19,700
been told that it's impossible to stop

873
00:40:19,700 --> 00:40:22,790
hackers and malware it may be but then

874
00:40:22,790 --> 00:40:26,240
if you know you can't just go with the

875
00:40:26,240 --> 00:40:28,460
assumption that my environment is same

876
00:40:28,460 --> 00:40:31,450
or safe or my environment is not safe

877
00:40:31,450 --> 00:40:34,760
scary checked it's very very important

878
00:40:34,760 --> 00:40:37,880
can you actually think a military

879
00:40:37,880 --> 00:40:41,570
general saying under attack that or they

880
00:40:41,570 --> 00:40:43,250
telling their subordinates and soldiers

881
00:40:43,250 --> 00:40:45,890
that there's absolutely no in no way

882
00:40:45,890 --> 00:40:47,870
that they are going to win no matter

883
00:40:47,870 --> 00:40:50,180
what they do even if you are going to

884
00:40:50,180 --> 00:40:52,460
give give him all the soldiers and

885
00:40:52,460 --> 00:40:54,620
weapons in the right places to defend

886
00:40:54,620 --> 00:40:58,910
with neither can i but that's what the

887
00:40:58,910 --> 00:41:01,460
world of computer security wants that

888
00:41:01,460 --> 00:41:05,030
like military general anything I have

889
00:41:05,030 --> 00:41:07,010
I'm gonna make sure that my system is

890
00:41:07,010 --> 00:41:09,740
gonna be safe I'm gonna make sure that

891
00:41:09,740 --> 00:41:12,560
anything happens I make sure that I have

892
00:41:12,560 --> 00:41:14,420
up-to-date patches my environment is

893
00:41:14,420 --> 00:41:17,260
gonna save it looks like a rosy picture

894
00:41:17,260 --> 00:41:19,910
but it's just that you have to practice

895
00:41:19,910 --> 00:41:23,420
it it's gonna take time how does the

896
00:41:23,420 --> 00:41:26,720
malicious actors are brilliant part of

897
00:41:26,720 --> 00:41:29,480
the reason for this belief that the

898
00:41:29,480 --> 00:41:31,430
hackers and the malware's hackers are

899
00:41:31,430 --> 00:41:32,970
actually good also

900
00:41:32,970 --> 00:41:37,140
but sometimes bad bad people also put

901
00:41:37,140 --> 00:41:40,320
malware's how is that I always think

902
00:41:40,320 --> 00:41:43,440
that this theorem is used and I have

903
00:41:43,440 --> 00:41:45,420
always been in a negative bait but then

904
00:41:45,420 --> 00:41:49,200
the that's all that should be used in a

905
00:41:49,200 --> 00:41:51,599
positive way because in some way we are

906
00:41:51,599 --> 00:41:53,700
all trying to break our own systems

907
00:41:53,700 --> 00:41:56,550
trying to pick our own security within

908
00:41:56,550 --> 00:41:59,730
the organization so we are also hackers

909
00:41:59,730 --> 00:42:02,070
so I'm gonna be referring this as a

910
00:42:02,070 --> 00:42:04,170
malicious actors who actually try to

911
00:42:04,170 --> 00:42:07,260
break our own system so the people who

912
00:42:07,260 --> 00:42:11,630
are working internally have to give that

913
00:42:11,630 --> 00:42:16,530
assurance to the bigger picture saying

914
00:42:16,530 --> 00:42:19,230
that yes our environment is gonna be

915
00:42:19,230 --> 00:42:23,280
same and CEOs have to have a proper

916
00:42:23,280 --> 00:42:26,340
strategy and this always begins by

917
00:42:26,340 --> 00:42:28,310
identifying the business goals and

918
00:42:28,310 --> 00:42:31,710
mapping potential benefits of the cloud

919
00:42:31,710 --> 00:42:34,650
to them while mitigating the perm the

920
00:42:34,650 --> 00:42:37,140
potential flaws throughout should always

921
00:42:37,140 --> 00:42:40,589
be thought of as a means to an end the

922
00:42:40,589 --> 00:42:43,050
end must be specified first that where

923
00:42:43,050 --> 00:42:45,060
exactly we're gonna be heading if you

924
00:42:45,060 --> 00:42:46,830
don't have a proper goal you're gonna

925
00:42:46,830 --> 00:42:48,510
fail come with me

926
00:42:48,510 --> 00:42:53,280
so these things are very shady and the

927
00:42:53,280 --> 00:42:56,730
lines are very crossovers wherein you

928
00:42:56,730 --> 00:42:58,589
can define who is going to be what's

929
00:42:58,589 --> 00:43:00,390
gonna be whose responsibility it's

930
00:43:00,390 --> 00:43:04,170
everyone's responsibility cloud security

931
00:43:04,170 --> 00:43:06,780
reality or the security reality that

932
00:43:06,780 --> 00:43:09,089
it's everyone's responsibility I when I

933
00:43:09,089 --> 00:43:11,010
was talking about different myths or

934
00:43:11,010 --> 00:43:13,020
different responsibilities different

935
00:43:13,020 --> 00:43:15,000
people who are working on it I was

936
00:43:15,000 --> 00:43:17,400
actually mixing up the whole

937
00:43:17,400 --> 00:43:19,050
responsibility section because it's

938
00:43:19,050 --> 00:43:21,359
everyone's responsibility about

939
00:43:21,359 --> 00:43:23,760
computing has the ability to scale any

940
00:43:23,760 --> 00:43:25,410
weight and drink products to market

941
00:43:25,410 --> 00:43:28,650
faster in addition to cost-saving that's

942
00:43:28,650 --> 00:43:31,500
one of the ground reality there are more

943
00:43:31,500 --> 00:43:35,040
than one cloud without providers public

944
00:43:35,040 --> 00:43:38,270
private hybrid hybrid crowd strategy our

945
00:43:38,270 --> 00:43:40,770
strategies are actually rapidly growing

946
00:43:40,770 --> 00:43:42,810
compared to the public and private what

947
00:43:42,810 --> 00:43:45,720
I have seen in the past few years the

948
00:43:45,720 --> 00:43:46,840
cloud is actually

949
00:43:46,840 --> 00:43:49,240
- which requires people with strong IT

950
00:43:49,240 --> 00:43:52,510
skills to plan implement and monitor and

951
00:43:52,510 --> 00:43:57,550
it does not take away IT jobs as you

952
00:43:57,550 --> 00:43:59,440
grow your environment grow you're gonna

953
00:43:59,440 --> 00:44:02,560
learn you're gonna implement more as the

954
00:44:02,560 --> 00:44:04,990
automation is coming as the cloud is

955
00:44:04,990 --> 00:44:07,830
growing it's gonna be opening new

956
00:44:07,830 --> 00:44:11,770
opportunities and moving to the cloud

957
00:44:11,770 --> 00:44:14,620
requires an ability to address a host of

958
00:44:14,620 --> 00:44:17,380
considerations like data migration the

959
00:44:17,380 --> 00:44:18,970
business specific capabilities of

960
00:44:18,970 --> 00:44:21,460
solutions that you have you need to have

961
00:44:21,460 --> 00:44:22,990
a proper change management system

962
00:44:22,990 --> 00:44:25,660
governance everything that you have

963
00:44:25,660 --> 00:44:27,460
in-house you need to make sure you have

964
00:44:27,460 --> 00:44:30,580
in cloud addition to the configuration

965
00:44:30,580 --> 00:44:32,560
settings you just need to know the

966
00:44:32,560 --> 00:44:34,540
environment well because you're gonna be

967
00:44:34,540 --> 00:44:37,810
maintaining it there you should know how

968
00:44:37,810 --> 00:44:39,280
you're gonna be handling your Incident

969
00:44:39,280 --> 00:44:41,170
Response on the cloud which is very very

970
00:44:41,170 --> 00:44:46,000
important how to do the patches how to

971
00:44:46,000 --> 00:44:48,730
manage the assets however you can

972
00:44:48,730 --> 00:44:51,490
achieve all this in most mature manner

973
00:44:51,490 --> 00:44:54,700
in the cloud fair is a good thing to

974
00:44:54,700 --> 00:44:57,700
have to make my data more secure it is

975
00:44:57,700 --> 00:45:00,630
very critical for me to understand what

976
00:45:00,630 --> 00:45:04,180
control I have over my data and cloud

977
00:45:04,180 --> 00:45:08,770
you actually have the control nobody is

978
00:45:08,770 --> 00:45:11,050
going to take away your control over

979
00:45:11,050 --> 00:45:14,500
your own data it's on you how you going

980
00:45:14,500 --> 00:45:16,570
to be who you're going to be giving the

981
00:45:16,570 --> 00:45:18,160
access if you're gonna making it if

982
00:45:18,160 --> 00:45:21,250
you're gonna be making it public you can

983
00:45:21,250 --> 00:45:23,170
be making it public you can't say that

984
00:45:23,170 --> 00:45:25,210
my data is safe it's gonna be for

985
00:45:25,210 --> 00:45:28,000
everyone and nothing on the Internet is

986
00:45:28,000 --> 00:45:30,540
never 100% secure

987
00:45:30,540 --> 00:45:35,230
now this is about the presentation and I

988
00:45:35,230 --> 00:45:38,680
want to thank Phil the people whose

989
00:45:38,680 --> 00:45:41,790
researchers have referred so here are

990
00:45:41,790 --> 00:45:44,530
few other links that I have gone through

991
00:45:44,530 --> 00:45:47,710
and I really liked the points that they

992
00:45:47,710 --> 00:45:52,090
have mentioned we can reach me at

993
00:45:52,090 --> 00:45:54,370
InfoSec one day now on twitter you can

994
00:45:54,370 --> 00:45:56,950
also reach me on linkedin if you have

995
00:45:56,950 --> 00:46:00,490
any questions after the session or

996
00:46:00,490 --> 00:46:02,589
