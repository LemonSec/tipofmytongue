1
00:00:00,319 --> 00:00:10,080
cool okay so high I'm I'm Matt I'm saira

2
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:11,969
liability engineer at Yelp don't ask her

3
00:00:10,080 --> 00:00:15,360
what a sigh reliability engineer is ask

4
00:00:11,969 --> 00:00:16,309
google still have no idea and i'm going

5
00:00:15,360 --> 00:00:19,109
to be talking to you today about

6
00:00:16,309 --> 00:00:23,820
security patching system packages is fun

7
00:00:19,109 --> 00:00:26,430
said no one ever so as always start with

8
00:00:23,820 --> 00:00:29,340
conclusion so basically like i'm going

9
00:00:26,430 --> 00:00:31,289
to be talking about system packaging and

10
00:00:29,340 --> 00:00:33,300
the security patching system packages

11
00:00:31,289 --> 00:00:36,870
but largely I'm mostly going to be using

12
00:00:33,300 --> 00:00:39,599
it as an example of a sort of kind of

13
00:00:36,870 --> 00:00:42,149
these points so like I'm actually

14
00:00:39,600 --> 00:00:43,950
actually going to read through these so

15
00:00:42,149 --> 00:00:46,469
the takeaway when you to get from this

16
00:00:43,950 --> 00:00:48,390
is that some security tasks are just a

17
00:00:46,469 --> 00:00:51,930
drag sometimes you just have to suck it

18
00:00:48,390 --> 00:00:54,030
up that's why you get paid and but you

19
00:00:51,930 --> 00:00:56,010
know in order to sort of combat that you

20
00:00:54,030 --> 00:00:59,789
know you can use social engineering for

21
00:00:56,010 --> 00:01:01,379
the protagonists too so you can use you

22
00:00:59,789 --> 00:01:02,940
can use things to sort of motivate your

23
00:01:01,379 --> 00:01:06,630
engineers in order to get some of this

24
00:01:02,940 --> 00:01:08,700
like real drag work done and you can use

25
00:01:06,630 --> 00:01:11,250
tooling to minimize their pain and to

26
00:01:08,700 --> 00:01:13,200
maximize motivation you can use

27
00:01:11,250 --> 00:01:14,880
technology to help solve people problems

28
00:01:13,200 --> 00:01:17,820
which is directly counter to what my

29
00:01:14,880 --> 00:01:23,100
first boss ever told me and also Lowell

30
00:01:17,820 --> 00:01:25,619
package management so who by why should

31
00:01:23,100 --> 00:01:27,539
you be listening to me because because

32
00:01:25,619 --> 00:01:29,549
I'm an Operations guy who worries too

33
00:01:27,540 --> 00:01:30,990
much like I think I'm probably the least

34
00:01:29,549 --> 00:01:33,960
qualified person here to talk about

35
00:01:30,990 --> 00:01:36,408
security but I do worry about it a lot I

36
00:01:33,960 --> 00:01:39,030
do think about it a lot I also like to

37
00:01:36,409 --> 00:01:41,759
think that I'm socially intelligent in

38
00:01:39,030 --> 00:01:43,799
some way shape or form but basically all

39
00:01:41,759 --> 00:01:46,079
of the pop psychology that I'm probably

40
00:01:43,799 --> 00:01:48,540
about spout I've never read anywhere

41
00:01:46,079 --> 00:01:50,070
other than the internet before so like

42
00:01:48,540 --> 00:01:57,509
you know take everything i say with a

43
00:01:50,070 --> 00:02:00,809
pinch of salt okay so who yelp so we're

44
00:01:57,509 --> 00:02:04,680
basically a website and app and all the

45
00:02:00,810 --> 00:02:07,049
rest we we basically crowdsource reviews

46
00:02:04,680 --> 00:02:09,810
from an extensive community and the idea

47
00:02:07,049 --> 00:02:12,690
is to help people discover businesses

48
00:02:09,810 --> 00:02:13,920
around them we're also a pretty big

49
00:02:12,690 --> 00:02:16,170
engineering

50
00:02:13,920 --> 00:02:19,230
so to give you an idea of the scale and

51
00:02:16,170 --> 00:02:21,089
this is all q2 2016 but then again most

52
00:02:19,230 --> 00:02:23,940
of the stuff of did in this talk is Q 2

53
00:02:21,090 --> 00:02:26,340
2016 so it's mostly relevant we had

54
00:02:23,940 --> 00:02:29,190
approximately ninety two million unique

55
00:02:26,340 --> 00:02:31,830
monthly visitors on mobile including app

56
00:02:29,190 --> 00:02:35,150
and mobile web more than 108 million

57
00:02:31,830 --> 00:02:37,950
reviews contributed since inception

58
00:02:35,150 --> 00:02:41,400
seventy-two percent of all searches came

59
00:02:37,950 --> 00:02:45,119
from mobile yelp is also present across

60
00:02:41,400 --> 00:02:47,489
32 different countries additional to

61
00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:52,140
this because these are these are like

62
00:02:47,489 --> 00:02:55,410
the PR slides we're we're also in terms

63
00:02:52,140 --> 00:02:58,619
of like our actual physical sort of

64
00:02:55,410 --> 00:03:00,780
presence on the web we r hybrid tin AWS

65
00:02:58,620 --> 00:03:05,610
cloud as well moving more and more

66
00:03:00,780 --> 00:03:07,650
towards AWS and we have I think four

67
00:03:05,610 --> 00:03:10,260
different engineering offices so I main

68
00:03:07,650 --> 00:03:13,380
office San Francisco I'm from the team

69
00:03:10,260 --> 00:03:15,870
in London obviously and then we also

70
00:03:13,380 --> 00:03:19,079
have engineering office in Hamburg and a

71
00:03:15,870 --> 00:03:23,010
much smaller one in Dublin so the

72
00:03:19,079 --> 00:03:25,530
operations team so we're not your sort

73
00:03:23,010 --> 00:03:27,540
of traditional you know just rebooting

74
00:03:25,530 --> 00:03:29,040
and saying no kind of operations theme

75
00:03:27,540 --> 00:03:32,250
like I like to think we're kind of like

76
00:03:29,040 --> 00:03:36,630
post DevOps like all of our bops have

77
00:03:32,250 --> 00:03:38,370
being devolved and they're basically you

78
00:03:36,630 --> 00:03:40,620
know we've we've been built on our own

79
00:03:38,370 --> 00:03:42,660
paths called pasta which stands for

80
00:03:40,620 --> 00:03:45,890
platform-as-a-service totally awesome

81
00:03:42,660 --> 00:03:48,660
because we're good at back run inning

82
00:03:45,890 --> 00:03:51,149
yet so so we were doing that managing

83
00:03:48,660 --> 00:03:54,420
our edge and supporting deploys

84
00:03:51,150 --> 00:03:57,060
developer workflows so basically like

85
00:03:54,420 --> 00:03:58,440
the most boring thing of all of that

86
00:03:57,060 --> 00:03:59,850
stuff we've got all these amazing

87
00:03:58,440 --> 00:04:01,410
interesting things that we could have

88
00:03:59,850 --> 00:04:03,900
our amazing interesting engine is

89
00:04:01,410 --> 00:04:05,370
working on but server instance

90
00:04:03,900 --> 00:04:07,620
maintenance is not one of those

91
00:04:05,370 --> 00:04:10,230
interesting things and under that comes

92
00:04:07,620 --> 00:04:12,480
you know security patching so actually

93
00:04:10,230 --> 00:04:14,429
you know we're a team that is a driving

94
00:04:12,480 --> 00:04:16,738
force of delivering innovation and new

95
00:04:14,430 --> 00:04:18,478
business value we don't want to be just

96
00:04:16,738 --> 00:04:25,560
like worrying about which package

97
00:04:18,478 --> 00:04:27,780
version is what so this how many of you

98
00:04:25,560 --> 00:04:31,650
kind of identify with this ever

99
00:04:27,780 --> 00:04:34,799
things on fire this is fine all right I

100
00:04:31,650 --> 00:04:36,630
think you're all liars to be honest so

101
00:04:34,800 --> 00:04:38,760
basically this is this is kind of like a

102
00:04:36,630 --> 00:04:40,710
very traditional ops kind of way of

103
00:04:38,760 --> 00:04:44,639
feeling about like security

104
00:04:40,710 --> 00:04:46,469
vulnerabilities coming out so like in

105
00:04:44,639 --> 00:04:48,750
the bad old days well what we tend to do

106
00:04:46,470 --> 00:04:50,760
is like you know we have our email feed

107
00:04:48,750 --> 00:04:51,960
of ubuntu security notices telling us

108
00:04:50,760 --> 00:04:54,389
you've got to patch this you could patch

109
00:04:51,960 --> 00:04:57,780
that and you sort of go like okay this

110
00:04:54,389 --> 00:04:59,520
is this is this is fine somebody's

111
00:04:57,780 --> 00:05:03,390
probably dealing with this because it's

112
00:04:59,520 --> 00:05:05,039
going in our collective inbox and you

113
00:05:03,390 --> 00:05:07,010
know once in a while they'll come along

114
00:05:05,040 --> 00:05:09,060
something that's like you know bind9

115
00:05:07,010 --> 00:05:11,719
vulnerability is like maybe we

116
00:05:09,060 --> 00:05:14,460
should actually definitely do that one

117
00:05:11,720 --> 00:05:17,490
the things kind of things of all things

118
00:05:14,460 --> 00:05:19,409
changed and as Elizabeth was saying like

119
00:05:17,490 --> 00:05:21,060
you know the security landscape is

120
00:05:19,410 --> 00:05:22,590
changing massively there's there's so

121
00:05:21,060 --> 00:05:24,810
much more of this like you know

122
00:05:22,590 --> 00:05:28,679
information is currency so much more

123
00:05:24,810 --> 00:05:30,150
data in the cloud and ultimately

124
00:05:28,680 --> 00:05:31,229
something's going to come along at some

125
00:05:30,150 --> 00:05:33,570
point that's going to make everybody

126
00:05:31,229 --> 00:05:34,859
wake up and and I like to kind of think

127
00:05:33,570 --> 00:05:38,070
that this is one of the big turning

128
00:05:34,860 --> 00:05:41,729
point sense why warm I I heartbleed SSL

129
00:05:38,070 --> 00:05:44,370
t-shirt today this is like the first big

130
00:05:41,729 --> 00:05:46,169
branded vulnerability and it really did

131
00:05:44,370 --> 00:05:48,479
shot quite a lot of people and it really

132
00:05:46,169 --> 00:05:51,240
should do because if you don't know how

133
00:05:48,479 --> 00:05:53,610
heartbleed works basically openssl

134
00:05:51,240 --> 00:05:56,550
clients could read arbitrary length of

135
00:05:53,610 --> 00:06:00,150
memory at the server like great good job

136
00:05:56,550 --> 00:06:03,419
cuts and I think this moves us more

137
00:06:00,150 --> 00:06:05,549
along to this kind of mentality this is

138
00:06:03,419 --> 00:06:07,710
this is not fine like we can't continue

139
00:06:05,550 --> 00:06:09,720
on this way because if we're letting

140
00:06:07,710 --> 00:06:13,890
these things slip through the gaps then

141
00:06:09,720 --> 00:06:15,680
you know ultimately we're landing we're

142
00:06:13,890 --> 00:06:18,750
landing ourselves in a position whereby

143
00:06:15,680 --> 00:06:20,460
we know that other people other

144
00:06:18,750 --> 00:06:22,050
nefarious people are getting the same

145
00:06:20,460 --> 00:06:24,210
vulnerabilities in their inbox and

146
00:06:22,050 --> 00:06:27,300
they're far more interested in them we

147
00:06:24,210 --> 00:06:28,770
are because they can make real bank on

148
00:06:27,300 --> 00:06:31,110
that sort of thing you know they can

149
00:06:28,770 --> 00:06:33,120
sell information that sort of stuff so

150
00:06:31,110 --> 00:06:34,500
you know we need to start to take action

151
00:06:33,120 --> 00:06:36,570
we need to start to realize that

152
00:06:34,500 --> 00:06:39,050
actually it's a pretty bad situation and

153
00:06:36,570 --> 00:06:41,079
we have to fight the growing tide of of

154
00:06:39,050 --> 00:06:44,269
vulnerabilities

155
00:06:41,079 --> 00:06:45,649
and basically relying on reading

156
00:06:44,269 --> 00:06:48,379
vulnerabilities that make it to happy

157
00:06:45,649 --> 00:06:50,059
news to do your job properly is really

158
00:06:48,379 --> 00:06:54,349
not a great way of catching all the edge

159
00:06:50,059 --> 00:06:57,199
cases so what's the problem here well

160
00:06:54,349 --> 00:07:01,128
patent system packages is hard and

161
00:06:57,199 --> 00:07:02,419
boring so you know there are obviously

162
00:07:01,129 --> 00:07:04,759
like the things that are difficult to

163
00:07:02,419 --> 00:07:06,139
upgrade in place like your MySQL master

164
00:07:04,759 --> 00:07:07,789
you cannot just going to do add get

165
00:07:06,139 --> 00:07:12,110
upgrade and hope you don't drop any

166
00:07:07,789 --> 00:07:14,269
rights and additionally you know Kirk

167
00:07:12,110 --> 00:07:16,459
coming from like the sort of context of

168
00:07:14,269 --> 00:07:19,489
actually yep you know our actual

169
00:07:16,459 --> 00:07:20,809
problems as a company who've done with

170
00:07:19,489 --> 00:07:22,609
quite a lot of moving fast and

171
00:07:20,809 --> 00:07:25,219
innovation you don't innovate without

172
00:07:22,610 --> 00:07:27,709
leaving behind some technical bet so I

173
00:07:25,219 --> 00:07:29,899
mean amongst here we've got Yelp packs

174
00:07:27,709 --> 00:07:31,669
were like sort of our configuration

175
00:07:29,899 --> 00:07:34,519
management before configuration

176
00:07:31,669 --> 00:07:37,279
management they're basically like Debian

177
00:07:34,519 --> 00:07:39,110
packages that contain a repo source and

178
00:07:37,279 --> 00:07:41,689
they're actually a meta package for a

179
00:07:39,110 --> 00:07:44,110
bunch of other packages it's basically

180
00:07:41,689 --> 00:07:47,929
doing like clever stuffed with that

181
00:07:44,110 --> 00:07:50,269
we've also got a for some edge cases

182
00:07:47,929 --> 00:07:52,549
what we like to lovingly refer to as

183
00:07:50,269 --> 00:07:54,619
Frank and lucid it's a bunting ten point

184
00:07:52,550 --> 00:07:57,709
oh four which is out of support which we

185
00:07:54,619 --> 00:08:00,769
keep alive with with backported kernel

186
00:07:57,709 --> 00:08:02,929
packages and all sort basically edge

187
00:08:00,769 --> 00:08:05,329
cases I mean docker is one here as well

188
00:08:02,929 --> 00:08:07,099
you can't just do SSH in a for loop to

189
00:08:05,329 --> 00:08:08,360
figure out what's installed in your dock

190
00:08:07,099 --> 00:08:12,378
contains because they shouldn't be

191
00:08:08,360 --> 00:08:14,899
running SSH the thing to take away from

192
00:08:12,379 --> 00:08:20,509
this to be fair is doing clever things

193
00:08:14,899 --> 00:08:22,339
with that whatever you do don't I if I

194
00:08:20,509 --> 00:08:27,709
can do nothing else but live to serve as

195
00:08:22,339 --> 00:08:30,049
a warning for others don't so I know

196
00:08:27,709 --> 00:08:31,789
what you're all thinking patching system

197
00:08:30,049 --> 00:08:34,789
packages isn't that hard you just do

198
00:08:31,789 --> 00:08:36,500
apt-get upgrade so even if your stack is

199
00:08:34,789 --> 00:08:39,588
simple enough for you to just be able to

200
00:08:36,500 --> 00:08:42,769
do an apt get upgrade on your running

201
00:08:39,589 --> 00:08:45,800
whatever was zero downtime I'm here to

202
00:08:42,769 --> 00:08:50,689
tell you that actually I was testing out

203
00:08:45,800 --> 00:08:52,880
an upgrade of lib Pam for like deal be

204
00:08:50,689 --> 00:08:54,649
frank and lucid in a docker container so

205
00:08:52,880 --> 00:08:56,990
I downloaded the three packages in

206
00:08:54,649 --> 00:08:58,430
needed to be upgraded I manually

207
00:08:56,990 --> 00:09:00,079
installed them with the package and D

208
00:08:58,430 --> 00:09:01,430
package does what it has always done

209
00:09:00,079 --> 00:09:03,128
since the dawn of time but you never

210
00:09:01,430 --> 00:09:06,258
remember because you always use that

211
00:09:03,129 --> 00:09:08,540
which is go uh there's these things that

212
00:09:06,259 --> 00:09:10,129
like I think need restarting there's

213
00:09:08,540 --> 00:09:12,290
these three different things that I know

214
00:09:10,129 --> 00:09:14,749
rely on Pam do you want to add any more

215
00:09:12,290 --> 00:09:17,329
to that list and I'm like yeah maybe SSH

216
00:09:14,749 --> 00:09:21,050
like possibly and this got me to

217
00:09:17,329 --> 00:09:23,899
thinking like well actually how often

218
00:09:21,050 --> 00:09:25,910
are we actually upgrading a thing an app

219
00:09:23,899 --> 00:09:27,949
is using the default I'm not actually

220
00:09:25,910 --> 00:09:30,110
restarting services that rely on this

221
00:09:27,949 --> 00:09:32,359
thing so I started wondering like well

222
00:09:30,110 --> 00:09:34,369
if I can't rely on what apps telling me

223
00:09:32,360 --> 00:09:36,800
and what's on disk I need to be able to

224
00:09:34,369 --> 00:09:38,509
look into memory to work out like what

225
00:09:36,800 --> 00:09:41,059
the hell's going on here and one of my

226
00:09:38,509 --> 00:09:44,809
colleagues pointed me to in the slash

227
00:09:41,059 --> 00:09:46,819
proc file system prog pidd of what I've

228
00:09:44,809 --> 00:09:49,540
bro Graeme trying to look at maps so

229
00:09:46,819 --> 00:09:52,969
what this script does you you give it a

230
00:09:49,540 --> 00:09:56,480
string to search for and it will

231
00:09:52,970 --> 00:09:59,269
basically crawl through every proc every

232
00:09:56,480 --> 00:10:01,819
pit in proc file system and it will look

233
00:09:59,269 --> 00:10:03,470
for anything as you can see that there

234
00:10:01,819 --> 00:10:05,748
that Brett this is awful bash by the way

235
00:10:03,470 --> 00:10:09,019
I'm really sorry I grabbed therefore

236
00:10:05,749 --> 00:10:10,550
deleted um run this on your longest

237
00:10:09,019 --> 00:10:13,610
running server that you've been doing at

238
00:10:10,550 --> 00:10:16,670
get upgrades on and see how many deleted

239
00:10:13,610 --> 00:10:19,429
libraries are still actually being run

240
00:10:16,670 --> 00:10:21,259
so you're still vulnerable because that

241
00:10:19,429 --> 00:10:26,389
vulnerable code is still in memory it's

242
00:10:21,259 --> 00:10:27,889
it's kind of scary so basically what I'm

243
00:10:26,389 --> 00:10:31,189
getting at here is Vista need eyes on

244
00:10:27,889 --> 00:10:33,139
from engineering and you know for tech

245
00:10:31,189 --> 00:10:34,879
debt reproducible builds all of that at

246
00:10:33,139 --> 00:10:37,399
least until we've built confidence in

247
00:10:34,879 --> 00:10:40,429
like actually removing some of our old

248
00:10:37,399 --> 00:10:43,329
crap and being in a position whereby you

249
00:10:40,429 --> 00:10:46,339
know we think that we can automate like

250
00:10:43,329 --> 00:10:47,989
stuff like you know pinning our

251
00:10:46,339 --> 00:10:50,059
repository so that we can get those

252
00:10:47,990 --> 00:10:52,160
reproducible builds and just be able to

253
00:10:50,059 --> 00:10:55,040
do those at gab grades in order to do

254
00:10:52,160 --> 00:10:58,309
security patching but it's really dull

255
00:10:55,040 --> 00:10:59,689
so what do we do well at first first

256
00:10:58,309 --> 00:11:01,490
things first like in order to actually

257
00:10:59,689 --> 00:11:03,019
sort of take some accountability like I

258
00:11:01,490 --> 00:11:05,029
mean I don't believe that anything

259
00:11:03,019 --> 00:11:06,920
that's everybody's responsibility will

260
00:11:05,029 --> 00:11:08,240
get done unless you actually dumped in

261
00:11:06,920 --> 00:11:11,930
someone's backyard

262
00:11:08,240 --> 00:11:16,640
hence the phrase not in my backyard so

263
00:11:11,930 --> 00:11:18,349
we created the auto sec JIRA project so

264
00:11:16,640 --> 00:11:21,290
basically these these emails that we're

265
00:11:18,350 --> 00:11:23,510
getting like fire hose din they

266
00:11:21,290 --> 00:11:27,890
basically now automatically create

267
00:11:23,510 --> 00:11:29,930
tickets in in this juror project and we

268
00:11:27,890 --> 00:11:32,750
had a script which we lovingly referred

269
00:11:29,930 --> 00:11:34,880
to as the wheel of misfortune which got

270
00:11:32,750 --> 00:11:36,980
run manually once in a while in order to

271
00:11:34,880 --> 00:11:40,640
actually you know ditch these tickets

272
00:11:36,980 --> 00:11:43,990
out to individuals so how did this work

273
00:11:40,640 --> 00:11:51,130
for us well where you can see here the

274
00:11:43,990 --> 00:11:54,200
the orange is to do the purple is done

275
00:11:51,130 --> 00:11:55,580
now let's not be let's not be too hard

276
00:11:54,200 --> 00:11:57,160
on ourselves because now at least we

277
00:11:55,580 --> 00:12:00,020
actually know that this isn't being done

278
00:11:57,160 --> 00:12:02,899
and you know hey look there's some

279
00:12:00,020 --> 00:12:05,420
purple that's cool right but ultimately

280
00:12:02,899 --> 00:12:07,149
these things are still piling up you can

281
00:12:05,420 --> 00:12:10,189
see sort of once in a while we're like

282
00:12:07,149 --> 00:12:12,050
somebody will decide a longer than purge

283
00:12:10,190 --> 00:12:14,690
all of these tickets we've got four like

284
00:12:12,050 --> 00:12:16,490
omap4 Colonel vulnerabilities because I

285
00:12:14,690 --> 00:12:22,520
really hope that our servers are running

286
00:12:16,490 --> 00:12:23,990
omap4 kernels but you know like you can

287
00:12:22,520 --> 00:12:25,670
see that once in a while someone spins

288
00:12:23,990 --> 00:12:29,270
the wheel of misfortune it's not a very

289
00:12:25,670 --> 00:12:31,250
like maintainable system and also like

290
00:12:29,270 --> 00:12:33,380
why are people not doing tickets that

291
00:12:31,250 --> 00:12:35,029
are assigned to them like I mean

292
00:12:33,380 --> 00:12:36,380
honestly people get assigned tickets

293
00:12:35,029 --> 00:12:39,860
they do the tickets that's how it works

294
00:12:36,380 --> 00:12:42,829
right well not necessarily like because

295
00:12:39,860 --> 00:12:44,779
tedious stuff is really tedious um and

296
00:12:42,829 --> 00:12:46,099
ultimately when you've got amazing work

297
00:12:44,779 --> 00:12:48,320
you could be doing on your on your

298
00:12:46,100 --> 00:12:50,420
platform as a service or you know

299
00:12:48,320 --> 00:12:52,339
juggling your edge traffic and stuff

300
00:12:50,420 --> 00:12:54,560
like that you know doing new innovative

301
00:12:52,339 --> 00:12:56,420
things sometimes when you've got those

302
00:12:54,560 --> 00:12:58,250
tedious tickets that are hard to do

303
00:12:56,420 --> 00:13:00,199
you're gonna put them at the bottom of

304
00:12:58,250 --> 00:13:03,770
your priority list especially if they

305
00:13:00,200 --> 00:13:04,970
don't have any deadlines on them so what

306
00:13:03,770 --> 00:13:06,949
do engine is like well they like

307
00:13:04,970 --> 00:13:09,350
interesting work they like new things

308
00:13:06,950 --> 00:13:11,660
they like feedback the tight feedback

309
00:13:09,350 --> 00:13:14,540
loop is really important to know that

310
00:13:11,660 --> 00:13:17,360
you're making any any impact at all and

311
00:13:14,540 --> 00:13:19,240
they also like agency and like agency is

312
00:13:17,360 --> 00:13:22,040
like one of my big words at the moment

313
00:13:19,240 --> 00:13:24,620
I'll bang on about it til the cows

314
00:13:22,040 --> 00:13:26,089
home agency is like the propensity of an

315
00:13:24,620 --> 00:13:29,209
engineer to call something to combust

316
00:13:26,089 --> 00:13:32,149
right but like in all seriousness like

317
00:13:29,209 --> 00:13:36,949
is the capacity of an actor to act in a

318
00:13:32,149 --> 00:13:38,209
given environment wikipedia and that's a

319
00:13:36,949 --> 00:13:41,209
really really important thing because

320
00:13:38,209 --> 00:13:43,069
basically we as engineers we want to be

321
00:13:41,209 --> 00:13:45,380
able to fix problems like I'm going to

322
00:13:43,069 --> 00:13:47,689
go against the normal ops stereotype

323
00:13:45,380 --> 00:13:50,509
here and be optimistic in that like you

324
00:13:47,690 --> 00:13:52,009
know people say Hanlon's razor never

325
00:13:50,509 --> 00:13:54,769
attribute to malice that which can be

326
00:13:52,009 --> 00:13:56,209
explained by stupidity I say never

327
00:13:54,769 --> 00:13:58,759
attribute to malice that which can be

328
00:13:56,209 --> 00:14:00,680
explained by lack of agency like we want

329
00:13:58,759 --> 00:14:03,680
to solve these problems it's just that

330
00:14:00,680 --> 00:14:06,859
they're they're hard it's hard to act in

331
00:14:03,680 --> 00:14:09,349
some of these in these situations so

332
00:14:06,860 --> 00:14:11,779
what is auto tech gah going for it it's

333
00:14:09,350 --> 00:14:14,959
not interesting none of it's different

334
00:14:11,779 --> 00:14:16,699
from previous iterations the feedback

335
00:14:14,959 --> 00:14:18,109
loop is pretty much non-existent and

336
00:14:16,699 --> 00:14:21,680
this is a really important thing about

337
00:14:18,110 --> 00:14:24,019
defensive security right if you patched

338
00:14:21,680 --> 00:14:26,739
the package there's no longer a

339
00:14:24,019 --> 00:14:29,240
vulnerability if you don't patch package

340
00:14:26,740 --> 00:14:31,339
still pretty unlikely that anybody is

341
00:14:29,240 --> 00:14:33,199
going to take advantage of that unless

342
00:14:31,339 --> 00:14:35,089
it's something like Hartley there's no

343
00:14:33,199 --> 00:14:36,560
feedback loop at all you'll feel like

344
00:14:35,089 --> 00:14:37,610
you've solved the problem because you

345
00:14:36,560 --> 00:14:40,939
weren't getting hacked in the first

346
00:14:37,610 --> 00:14:43,720
place hopefully and again it's still I'm

347
00:14:40,940 --> 00:14:47,389
not getting hacked that I know of

348
00:14:43,720 --> 00:14:48,860
fantastic and there's no real agency to

349
00:14:47,389 --> 00:14:51,230
it and this is this is particularly a

350
00:14:48,860 --> 00:14:54,069
problem of our of our processing our

351
00:14:51,230 --> 00:14:56,300
workflow in all of this in that

352
00:14:54,069 --> 00:14:57,949
basically the critical path for this is

353
00:14:56,300 --> 00:15:00,290
hard to find there was no real like

354
00:14:57,949 --> 00:15:02,149
policy on how do you make decisions

355
00:15:00,290 --> 00:15:05,269
about what patch will not patch how to

356
00:15:02,149 --> 00:15:07,130
patch things the docks were just

357
00:15:05,269 --> 00:15:09,490
disjointed for all the different sort of

358
00:15:07,130 --> 00:15:11,959
edge cases I was talking about and

359
00:15:09,490 --> 00:15:13,850
decisions are difficult because there's

360
00:15:11,959 --> 00:15:16,869
no feedback loop like once you've

361
00:15:13,850 --> 00:15:20,300
completed one one set of tickets like

362
00:15:16,870 --> 00:15:24,589
how does that inform the rest of them it

363
00:15:20,300 --> 00:15:29,329
hasn't um and so what do you do you

364
00:15:24,589 --> 00:15:30,980
differ and procrastinate you know um and

365
00:15:29,329 --> 00:15:33,729
who wants to hurry differing

366
00:15:30,980 --> 00:15:33,730
procrastinator

367
00:15:34,180 --> 00:15:38,660
so what do I think we can fix like how

368
00:15:36,649 --> 00:15:40,430
can we get from that stage of like this

369
00:15:38,660 --> 00:15:42,410
is fine so actually this is really not

370
00:15:40,430 --> 00:15:44,060
fine like let's actually do something

371
00:15:42,410 --> 00:15:46,219
about this let's be proactive about it

372
00:15:44,060 --> 00:15:47,869
well I'm not wizard so I can't make it

373
00:15:46,220 --> 00:15:50,120
interesting all of a sudden and I

374
00:15:47,870 --> 00:15:53,480
certainly can't make it new like this is

375
00:15:50,120 --> 00:15:55,009
janitorial work but what I reckon we can

376
00:15:53,480 --> 00:15:56,779
do is I reckon we can add into the

377
00:15:55,009 --> 00:15:59,000
feedback and I reckon we can sort of

378
00:15:56,779 --> 00:16:00,529
increase like perceived agency of the

379
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:02,149
whole thing because it's not like these

380
00:16:00,529 --> 00:16:04,339
tasks and things that our engineers

381
00:16:02,149 --> 00:16:07,550
can't do they just don't necessarily

382
00:16:04,339 --> 00:16:09,259
feel super enabled to like they don't

383
00:16:07,550 --> 00:16:14,240
feel like their ability to act is

384
00:16:09,259 --> 00:16:15,589
maximized so we decided so we work in

385
00:16:14,240 --> 00:16:17,959
like okay ours I think there are

386
00:16:15,589 --> 00:16:21,620
objective key results but they're like

387
00:16:17,959 --> 00:16:22,969
sort of organizational goals and one of

388
00:16:21,620 --> 00:16:26,060
them that we started doing is the

389
00:16:22,970 --> 00:16:28,819
autocheck okay the idea for this being

390
00:16:26,060 --> 00:16:30,619
like to be aim to reduce the mean time

391
00:16:28,819 --> 00:16:34,040
to resolution for security tickets

392
00:16:30,620 --> 00:16:36,470
within second quarter the idea being

393
00:16:34,040 --> 00:16:38,120
anything new that comes in now should be

394
00:16:36,470 --> 00:16:42,079
resolved within two weeks unless it's

395
00:16:38,120 --> 00:16:45,259
absolutely critical close out all pre to

396
00:16:42,079 --> 00:16:50,800
q 2 2016 tickets so that backlog that

397
00:16:45,259 --> 00:16:53,509
big swaths of orange what's the orange

398
00:16:50,800 --> 00:16:56,508
that needs to disappear and that was one

399
00:16:53,509 --> 00:16:57,889
of our goals now one of the things about

400
00:16:56,509 --> 00:16:59,779
this is that we had organized

401
00:16:57,889 --> 00:17:02,120
organizational buy-in so we are playing

402
00:16:59,779 --> 00:17:03,740
on easy mode right and I appreciate that

403
00:17:02,120 --> 00:17:06,650
this is really difficult thing to do for

404
00:17:03,740 --> 00:17:08,419
some people so one of the things to bear

405
00:17:06,650 --> 00:17:13,579
in mind and the following slides is like

406
00:17:08,419 --> 00:17:15,620
the methods that we use they are the

407
00:17:13,579 --> 00:17:18,829
methods that we use there they're not

408
00:17:15,619 --> 00:17:20,688
necessarily like things you have to have

409
00:17:18,829 --> 00:17:23,569
that organizational buy-in for you can

410
00:17:20,689 --> 00:17:25,400
sort of like do it bit by bit you can

411
00:17:23,569 --> 00:17:28,399
you can just decide you're going to do

412
00:17:25,400 --> 00:17:30,590
some stuff you know so how do we go

413
00:17:28,400 --> 00:17:32,539
about doing so automating district

414
00:17:30,590 --> 00:17:34,459
distribution of work including adding

415
00:17:32,539 --> 00:17:36,740
deadlines increases agency because you

416
00:17:34,460 --> 00:17:38,870
know how to prioritize then tying up

417
00:17:36,740 --> 00:17:40,370
feedback loop with metrics and frequent

418
00:17:38,870 --> 00:17:42,199
reports whilst you won't necessarily

419
00:17:40,370 --> 00:17:44,059
know the weather you can either climb it

420
00:17:42,200 --> 00:17:46,700
so what's the position and the momentum

421
00:17:44,059 --> 00:17:47,470
in terms of how close are we to actually

422
00:17:46,700 --> 00:17:50,230
being

423
00:17:47,470 --> 00:17:52,030
top of this problem and make the

424
00:17:50,230 --> 00:17:54,280
critical path the decisive action more

425
00:17:52,030 --> 00:17:56,500
explicit so improved documentation make

426
00:17:54,280 --> 00:18:00,460
it easy to get help and improve perceive

427
00:17:56,500 --> 00:18:01,840
a perceived agency again so one of the

428
00:18:00,460 --> 00:18:03,820
key parts of this is you've got to

429
00:18:01,840 --> 00:18:04,928
recognize the futility of it like these

430
00:18:03,820 --> 00:18:08,080
are going to keep coming in they're

431
00:18:04,929 --> 00:18:09,730
going to continue to be boring there are

432
00:18:08,080 --> 00:18:11,439
some key problems here like asking non

433
00:18:09,730 --> 00:18:14,140
security specialists to make security

434
00:18:11,440 --> 00:18:15,610
decisions is really hard people don't

435
00:18:14,140 --> 00:18:17,950
feel confident in themselves especially

436
00:18:15,610 --> 00:18:21,309
of a like me don't have security and

437
00:18:17,950 --> 00:18:23,650
their job title won't fix is against

438
00:18:21,309 --> 00:18:25,750
engineering nature like we want to fix

439
00:18:23,650 --> 00:18:28,299
everything um but to a degree that's

440
00:18:25,750 --> 00:18:31,570
naive interventionism like in the sense

441
00:18:28,299 --> 00:18:33,490
that if you want to solve the security

442
00:18:31,570 --> 00:18:36,039
problem completely unplug all your

443
00:18:33,490 --> 00:18:38,169
Ethernet cables right problem solved um

444
00:18:36,039 --> 00:18:40,210
but actually you know you need to

445
00:18:38,169 --> 00:18:42,130
balance this against actually moving

446
00:18:40,210 --> 00:18:45,340
fast and your competitors delivering

447
00:18:42,130 --> 00:18:46,840
business value the other thing is like

448
00:18:45,340 --> 00:18:49,658
you only find out when you do the wrong

449
00:18:46,840 --> 00:18:51,370
thing in terms of tight feedback like

450
00:18:49,659 --> 00:18:53,740
you get hacked so that's how you know

451
00:18:51,370 --> 00:18:54,908
you did the wrong thing so you need to

452
00:18:53,740 --> 00:18:58,000
empower people to make hard decisions

453
00:18:54,909 --> 00:19:00,460
that have little payoff so one of the

454
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:02,200
first things we did is it was create the

455
00:19:00,460 --> 00:19:03,970
auto sec review mail group and this is

456
00:19:02,200 --> 00:19:05,950
just a bunch of people who'd express the

457
00:19:03,970 --> 00:19:08,320
interest who you can tag in on your

458
00:19:05,950 --> 00:19:09,460
ticket so like if you say I'm not going

459
00:19:08,320 --> 00:19:11,379
to fix this thing I'm not going to do

460
00:19:09,460 --> 00:19:13,270
anything there's no code review involved

461
00:19:11,380 --> 00:19:14,470
in that so what you do is you make so

462
00:19:13,270 --> 00:19:16,210
that when people want to make that

463
00:19:14,470 --> 00:19:19,090
decision they can say I'm going to do

464
00:19:16,210 --> 00:19:21,400
this for these reasons tag these people

465
00:19:19,090 --> 00:19:25,090
anybody can then dive in and say okay

466
00:19:21,400 --> 00:19:26,380
yeah that sounds cool ship it and and

467
00:19:25,090 --> 00:19:28,510
this is kind of the theme is like

468
00:19:26,380 --> 00:19:33,490
anything you can do to make things less

469
00:19:28,510 --> 00:19:36,760
painful so work distribution so we

470
00:19:33,490 --> 00:19:39,220
created a service which could basically

471
00:19:36,760 --> 00:19:41,350
have been a cron job which is just

472
00:19:39,220 --> 00:19:43,809
interfacing with JIRA like tier is a

473
00:19:41,350 --> 00:19:46,120
tool we've already got so we can

474
00:19:43,809 --> 00:19:47,190
basically say like we can roll the

475
00:19:46,120 --> 00:19:51,039
mirror or the wheel of misfortune

476
00:19:47,190 --> 00:19:52,570
automated on regular basis and that that

477
00:19:51,039 --> 00:19:55,658
really helps you know because then

478
00:19:52,570 --> 00:19:57,250
there's a there's a sort of flat level

479
00:19:55,659 --> 00:20:00,399
of your sort of incoming number of

480
00:19:57,250 --> 00:20:01,360
tickets easier to manage workflow we've

481
00:20:00,399 --> 00:20:04,270
got feedback

482
00:20:01,360 --> 00:20:06,549
like metrics and reporting Netflix

483
00:20:04,270 --> 00:20:08,470
skunkworks Gojira is great if you want

484
00:20:06,549 --> 00:20:11,080
to do reporting based off of JIRA stuff

485
00:20:08,470 --> 00:20:12,640
so we were sending out email saying this

486
00:20:11,080 --> 00:20:15,820
is this is how close we are to the goal

487
00:20:12,640 --> 00:20:17,440
keep up the good work it helps people

488
00:20:15,820 --> 00:20:18,909
know that their that they're helping us

489
00:20:17,440 --> 00:20:21,250
progress you know they're working

490
00:20:18,910 --> 00:20:22,330
towards a central thing and ultimately

491
00:20:21,250 --> 00:20:25,830
you've got a bear amount of this is

492
00:20:22,330 --> 00:20:28,689
pretty much the only feedback we've got

493
00:20:25,830 --> 00:20:30,820
increase agency critical path there is a

494
00:20:28,690 --> 00:20:33,850
horrible wall of text so you reduce the

495
00:20:30,820 --> 00:20:36,189
horrible wall of text so like we cleared

496
00:20:33,850 --> 00:20:37,990
up the documentation and a well-defined

497
00:20:36,190 --> 00:20:40,299
process on paper is still difficult to

498
00:20:37,990 --> 00:20:43,720
follow I'll get into that again in like

499
00:20:40,299 --> 00:20:45,400
a second but we did anyway because it's

500
00:20:43,720 --> 00:20:48,610
on the critical path to actually knowing

501
00:20:45,400 --> 00:20:51,100
what our processes so we increase agency

502
00:20:48,610 --> 00:20:53,049
by removing extraneous information so

503
00:20:51,100 --> 00:20:54,879
like in terms of the way the documents

504
00:20:53,049 --> 00:20:56,168
will previous Lee laid out for this you

505
00:20:54,880 --> 00:20:57,850
get to the end of the document after

506
00:20:56,169 --> 00:21:00,820
having read the whole thing i said i aid

507
00:20:57,850 --> 00:21:03,760
i need to do anything like could have

508
00:21:00,820 --> 00:21:06,220
told me earlier so reorganizing that

509
00:21:03,760 --> 00:21:08,020
stuff so that like a no-op is basically

510
00:21:06,220 --> 00:21:09,970
the first thing you find out about like

511
00:21:08,020 --> 00:21:12,250
don't give people more information they

512
00:21:09,970 --> 00:21:14,140
need because that decreases agency

513
00:21:12,250 --> 00:21:16,570
because a document is basically

514
00:21:14,140 --> 00:21:18,130
something that you read in order to be

515
00:21:16,570 --> 00:21:21,340
able to do a job when you don't know how

516
00:21:18,130 --> 00:21:23,559
to do it if you do know how to do it

517
00:21:21,340 --> 00:21:29,290
there are problems associated with that

518
00:21:23,559 --> 00:21:31,059
too but moving on so we also introduced

519
00:21:29,290 --> 00:21:32,590
the NAG bot this is part of our auto sex

520
00:21:31,059 --> 00:21:34,418
service and it would basically tell

521
00:21:32,590 --> 00:21:36,610
people how long they had to finish the

522
00:21:34,419 --> 00:21:38,200
ticket whether it was gonna overrun and

523
00:21:36,610 --> 00:21:39,668
this is because deadlines are really

524
00:21:38,200 --> 00:21:43,059
important right if you want to

525
00:21:39,669 --> 00:21:45,610
prioritize work you're not going to do

526
00:21:43,059 --> 00:21:47,410
shitty work that somebody said it just

527
00:21:45,610 --> 00:21:49,330
needs to be done or it should have been

528
00:21:47,410 --> 00:21:51,669
done or stuff like that because clearly

529
00:21:49,330 --> 00:21:53,199
there's no like impetus for it you've

530
00:21:51,669 --> 00:21:56,140
got a deadline you can balance against

531
00:21:53,200 --> 00:22:00,429
the more interesting work so did it work

532
00:21:56,140 --> 00:22:02,830
um well this over here is where a cut

533
00:22:00,429 --> 00:22:05,230
off the graph earlier I'd say that's

534
00:22:02,830 --> 00:22:07,649
pretty good personally like that is an

535
00:22:05,230 --> 00:22:10,720
improved situation going on right there

536
00:22:07,650 --> 00:22:12,460
this is a very very blurry slide so home

537
00:22:10,720 --> 00:22:14,020
from somebody else's slide on a webinar

538
00:22:12,460 --> 00:22:14,509
because I didn't actually want to have

539
00:22:14,020 --> 00:22:16,699
to look

540
00:22:14,509 --> 00:22:22,070
information up but they did it for me

541
00:22:16,699 --> 00:22:24,859
hooray I would bet money on the fact

542
00:22:22,070 --> 00:22:27,079
that that remaining not done stuff

543
00:22:24,859 --> 00:22:28,820
that's probably all to do with our yelp

544
00:22:27,079 --> 00:22:30,889
packs which were working on a background

545
00:22:28,820 --> 00:22:34,339
but those tickets are really really

546
00:22:30,889 --> 00:22:36,589
difficult to do so what we're going to

547
00:22:34,339 --> 00:22:38,269
do next to improve so we're going to

548
00:22:36,589 --> 00:22:41,779
reduce like sort of pointless overhead

549
00:22:38,269 --> 00:22:43,309
so stuff like Snapdragon kernels we're

550
00:22:41,779 --> 00:22:45,739
not really running those so we need to

551
00:22:43,309 --> 00:22:47,569
cut out these incoming tickets and auto

552
00:22:45,739 --> 00:22:49,879
triage information out of them and maybe

553
00:22:47,569 --> 00:22:51,619
we can introspect and feed back into the

554
00:22:49,879 --> 00:22:54,589
ticket automatically where is this

555
00:22:51,619 --> 00:22:56,238
installed how old is the version that

556
00:22:54,589 --> 00:22:58,668
sort of thing we also need to eliminate

557
00:22:56,239 --> 00:23:01,099
like menthol caching um so I was

558
00:22:58,669 --> 00:23:02,929
thinking about like who just reads off

559
00:23:01,099 --> 00:23:04,309
of a script people who bring you up and

560
00:23:02,929 --> 00:23:06,440
told you tell you you've been miss old

561
00:23:04,309 --> 00:23:08,329
PPI I'd like to imagine that maybe

562
00:23:06,440 --> 00:23:10,459
they're like oh it's actually a person

563
00:23:08,329 --> 00:23:13,879
driving a robot with keyboard that says

564
00:23:10,459 --> 00:23:16,449
like mis-sold PPI like I heard you were

565
00:23:13,879 --> 00:23:19,129
in a car accident that wasn't your fault

566
00:23:16,449 --> 00:23:20,629
so is the idea of producing an interface

567
00:23:19,129 --> 00:23:22,428
is actually you suited to this whole

568
00:23:20,629 --> 00:23:25,099
thing if we can turn the documentation

569
00:23:22,429 --> 00:23:27,349
to a script that ask your questions and

570
00:23:25,099 --> 00:23:29,479
those actions based on your answers then

571
00:23:27,349 --> 00:23:31,189
actually we've removed the extraneous

572
00:23:29,479 --> 00:23:33,859
information we've made the process more

573
00:23:31,190 --> 00:23:36,769
interactive but also process changes can

574
00:23:33,859 --> 00:23:38,418
be code reviewed for greater confidence

575
00:23:36,769 --> 00:23:41,029
and it means that people don't mentally

576
00:23:38,419 --> 00:23:43,190
cash the document they they will know

577
00:23:41,029 --> 00:23:44,299
when a difference occurs simply because

578
00:23:43,190 --> 00:23:45,739
they'll be running the script because

579
00:23:44,299 --> 00:23:47,959
it's easier than reading a document

580
00:23:45,739 --> 00:23:50,929
there's nobody likes reading documents

581
00:23:47,959 --> 00:23:55,369
even once and also fix our packaging but

582
00:23:50,929 --> 00:23:57,769
like yeah whatever you guys so the

583
00:23:55,369 --> 00:23:59,718
takeaway some security task just a drag

584
00:23:57,769 --> 00:24:03,769
social engineering is four protagonists

585
00:23:59,719 --> 00:24:06,769
to use tooling to minimize pain and

586
00:24:03,769 --> 00:24:08,779
maximize motivation and you can use

587
00:24:06,769 --> 00:24:10,639
technology to help solve people problems

588
00:24:08,779 --> 00:24:13,909
and Lowell package management and I

589
00:24:10,639 --> 00:24:15,968
think I'm like well over time thanks for

590
00:24:13,909 --> 00:24:15,969
listening
