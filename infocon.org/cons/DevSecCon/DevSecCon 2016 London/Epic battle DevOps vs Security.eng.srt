1
00:00:00,350 --> 00:00:09,870
hello everyone welcome to epic battle

2
00:00:03,030 --> 00:00:16,049
devils vs security I'm frozen I AKA

3
00:00:09,870 --> 00:00:18,630
player 1 so I'm a ex sysadmin x devops

4
00:00:16,049 --> 00:00:21,060
engineer now a cloud security operations

5
00:00:18,630 --> 00:00:26,640
engineer capital one you can properly

6
00:00:21,060 --> 00:00:32,549
dealt not graphic designer yeah i'm

7
00:00:26,640 --> 00:00:34,770
representing delp's well you got one

8
00:00:32,549 --> 00:00:39,059
here let's here i go on hello everyone

9
00:00:34,770 --> 00:00:41,760
I'm Nick I am player too I am exercise

10
00:00:39,059 --> 00:00:44,040
min IMX security operations before it

11
00:00:41,760 --> 00:00:47,280
was called security operations explain

12
00:00:44,040 --> 00:00:50,309
toaster x pci q SI x security architect

13
00:00:47,280 --> 00:00:54,840
i am also not a graphic graphic designer

14
00:00:50,309 --> 00:00:58,730
I will be representing security okay Wow

15
00:00:54,840 --> 00:01:04,820
a quick show of hands who's a developer

16
00:00:58,730 --> 00:01:04,819
okay whose operations whose security oh

17
00:01:05,150 --> 00:01:09,900
wow six security maintaining their

18
00:01:08,460 --> 00:01:12,899
operational security in staying very

19
00:01:09,900 --> 00:01:16,920
quiet I like it alright so their vaults

20
00:01:12,900 --> 00:01:18,030
versus security um something I should

21
00:01:16,920 --> 00:01:22,229
have grabbed I have been paying

22
00:01:18,030 --> 00:01:24,750
attention today I've like genuinely GC

23
00:01:22,229 --> 00:01:27,110
for my security background interest in

24
00:01:24,750 --> 00:01:30,090
this I'm enjoyed the talks however

25
00:01:27,110 --> 00:01:31,680
they're all wrong basically so those of

26
00:01:30,090 --> 00:01:35,549
you who've stayed looks like about half

27
00:01:31,680 --> 00:01:39,479
of you well done you didn't bother

28
00:01:35,549 --> 00:01:41,310
coming really I mean Chris dare said

29
00:01:39,479 --> 00:01:42,810
earlier actually said it was good that

30
00:01:41,310 --> 00:01:44,820
everybody's agreeing you keep getting

31
00:01:42,810 --> 00:01:47,340
the same talks it's not the way it

32
00:01:44,820 --> 00:01:48,720
should have been I mean I'm as shown I'm

33
00:01:47,340 --> 00:01:52,820
an ex decide when I've been doing

34
00:01:48,720 --> 00:01:54,780
security since Fraser was a teenager and

35
00:01:52,820 --> 00:01:57,469
some of the terms of good things like

36
00:01:54,780 --> 00:02:00,390
full spank ninja sounds fantastic but

37
00:01:57,469 --> 00:02:03,899
DevOps is just a bad idea the thing it

38
00:02:00,390 --> 00:02:06,119
reminds me of is the internet of things

39
00:02:03,899 --> 00:02:07,500
it's just you get all that technology

40
00:02:06,119 --> 00:02:08,788
together and you have to get it to

41
00:02:07,500 --> 00:02:10,919
market and you just get some code

42
00:02:08,788 --> 00:02:12,690
together and you just publish it and you

43
00:02:10,919 --> 00:02:13,589
end up with just the stuff like the

44
00:02:12,690 --> 00:02:16,920
stuff that happened to

45
00:02:13,590 --> 00:02:19,860
you Brian Krebs the Myra botnet you just

46
00:02:16,920 --> 00:02:22,410
compromised globally the internet of

47
00:02:19,860 --> 00:02:26,519
things really easily take down his

48
00:02:22,410 --> 00:02:27,780
service so problem is you're going to

49
00:02:26,519 --> 00:02:30,090
end up with DevOps you can end up with

50
00:02:27,780 --> 00:02:36,000
an Internet of crap thousand points to

51
00:02:30,090 --> 00:02:38,459
security okay all right all right just

52
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:40,019
to be clear then so DevOps you know it's

53
00:02:38,459 --> 00:02:43,290
not a management fat or anything like

54
00:02:40,019 --> 00:02:46,410
that yeah as you've heard the intro

55
00:02:43,290 --> 00:02:48,420
sorry all right thank you again is worth

56
00:02:46,410 --> 00:02:51,750
waking to iPhone off still another

57
00:02:48,420 --> 00:02:53,609
important Quixote right yeah so DevOps

58
00:02:51,750 --> 00:02:54,959
is it's it's not of management fabre

59
00:02:53,610 --> 00:02:58,260
like that everyone here knows what

60
00:02:54,959 --> 00:03:00,720
DevOps is all I get broken down into

61
00:02:58,260 --> 00:03:03,239
culture automation lean measurement and

62
00:03:00,720 --> 00:03:05,640
sharing and then sort of dev psych ops

63
00:03:03,239 --> 00:03:08,540
is obviously just that with security and

64
00:03:05,640 --> 00:03:10,649
I know if is argued today much but

65
00:03:08,540 --> 00:03:12,359
people suggest that the security should

66
00:03:10,650 --> 00:03:13,849
automatically part of DevOps then you

67
00:03:12,360 --> 00:03:16,349
shouldn't need the term dev psych ops

68
00:03:13,849 --> 00:03:17,929
but I quite like dev psych ops or sec

69
00:03:16,349 --> 00:03:21,149
dev ops or whatever or rugged DevOps

70
00:03:17,930 --> 00:03:23,609
because it reminds you to remember about

71
00:03:21,150 --> 00:03:26,810
the security element so if you just call

72
00:03:23,609 --> 00:03:29,220
it DevOps it can be a little bit ignored

73
00:03:26,810 --> 00:03:32,700
so yeah I mean that's that's DevOps it's

74
00:03:29,220 --> 00:03:34,859
it's it's not it's not it's a grassroots

75
00:03:32,700 --> 00:03:40,290
movement to get stuff done faster and

76
00:03:34,859 --> 00:03:42,480
better with more quality yeah but it's

77
00:03:40,290 --> 00:03:44,578
still just those separate teams can't

78
00:03:42,480 --> 00:03:46,619
you just have meetings we can all talk

79
00:03:44,579 --> 00:03:49,200
to each other card you have those remote

80
00:03:46,620 --> 00:03:52,799
meetings were all connected all the time

81
00:03:49,200 --> 00:03:55,250
you can just talk to each other and the

82
00:03:52,799 --> 00:04:00,329
great thing as we said previously is

83
00:03:55,250 --> 00:04:02,099
separation of duties also just the

84
00:04:00,329 --> 00:04:04,799
security here you've got different

85
00:04:02,099 --> 00:04:06,268
groups of people and as we said it was

86
00:04:04,799 --> 00:04:07,829
Colleen said earlier I think in one of

87
00:04:06,269 --> 00:04:11,040
his slides was like developers are from

88
00:04:07,829 --> 00:04:13,739
our securities from Venus operations is

89
00:04:11,040 --> 00:04:15,810
from Neptune shift leaders on technical

90
00:04:13,739 --> 00:04:18,060
support from Pluto you get these are

91
00:04:15,810 --> 00:04:20,280
different types of people with different

92
00:04:18,060 --> 00:04:21,988
functions if you separate them all you

93
00:04:20,279 --> 00:04:23,909
get the benefit of DevOps because you

94
00:04:21,988 --> 00:04:26,700
still talk to each other but you don't

95
00:04:23,909 --> 00:04:31,260
lose that security can't we just talk so

96
00:04:26,700 --> 00:04:34,560
another thousand points exactly that you

97
00:04:31,260 --> 00:04:38,340
pretty much nailed it DevOps isn't about

98
00:04:34,560 --> 00:04:40,200
a unicorn engineer doing all the things

99
00:04:38,340 --> 00:04:43,500
it is about breaking down those

100
00:04:40,200 --> 00:04:45,000
traditional silos there's different ways

101
00:04:43,500 --> 00:04:46,230
of doing it as you say you know

102
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:47,790
different functional you have a

103
00:04:46,230 --> 00:04:51,030
functional team with members from

104
00:04:47,790 --> 00:04:52,710
security operations QA developers etc on

105
00:04:51,030 --> 00:04:55,080
the same team with the same sort of

106
00:04:52,710 --> 00:04:57,630
goals or different teams working

107
00:04:55,080 --> 00:04:59,250
together that's its it's about getting

108
00:04:57,630 --> 00:05:05,120
the right people involved earlier on

109
00:04:59,250 --> 00:05:07,740
it's not about unicorns then still

110
00:05:05,120 --> 00:05:09,450
meetings but now with just all these

111
00:05:07,740 --> 00:05:10,800
different teams all have to talk to each

112
00:05:09,450 --> 00:05:12,539
other because you've got all this

113
00:05:10,800 --> 00:05:15,540
communication going on it's the same

114
00:05:12,540 --> 00:05:18,840
meetings but with more gimmicks and more

115
00:05:15,540 --> 00:05:20,820
overhead and from this slide the guy at

116
00:05:18,840 --> 00:05:22,250
the top left in the black with his

117
00:05:20,820 --> 00:05:24,960
earphones are not talking to anyone

118
00:05:22,250 --> 00:05:26,730
definitely from security it's the same

119
00:05:24,960 --> 00:05:28,560
meetings but for some reason you will

120
00:05:26,730 --> 00:05:32,220
decide to add post it notes and take

121
00:05:28,560 --> 00:05:36,780
away chairs or it's just meetings but

122
00:05:32,220 --> 00:05:39,840
weirder say well problems it's another

123
00:05:36,780 --> 00:05:44,820
thousand points I'm doing quite well

124
00:05:39,840 --> 00:05:47,130
stated yeah okay yeah it doesn't have to

125
00:05:44,820 --> 00:05:48,510
be like that though I I agree with the

126
00:05:47,130 --> 00:05:52,290
idea of the separation and having the

127
00:05:48,510 --> 00:05:55,140
different teams but and this is where

128
00:05:52,290 --> 00:05:57,600
automation comes into play you know do

129
00:05:55,140 --> 00:05:58,830
things as code have think of teams as

130
00:05:57,600 --> 00:06:00,810
microservices you know we're going to

131
00:05:58,830 --> 00:06:03,120
jump on the SLA van wagon think of them

132
00:06:00,810 --> 00:06:06,510
as micro services and have well-defined

133
00:06:03,120 --> 00:06:08,070
api's and interfaces that way you get

134
00:06:06,510 --> 00:06:10,740
the benefits as the separation of duty

135
00:06:08,070 --> 00:06:14,550
but you can use automation to speed up

136
00:06:10,740 --> 00:06:16,710
and remove that human element you know

137
00:06:14,550 --> 00:06:18,090
you've got developers here there see I

138
00:06:16,710 --> 00:06:20,039
see the environments talking to the ops

139
00:06:18,090 --> 00:06:22,229
which talks a second devs talk directly

140
00:06:20,040 --> 00:06:24,450
to apps and app sec although that could

141
00:06:22,230 --> 00:06:25,770
be automated all your pipeline stuff

142
00:06:24,450 --> 00:06:27,870
could be you know push through to

143
00:06:25,770 --> 00:06:30,030
production or whatever within 20 minutes

144
00:06:27,870 --> 00:06:32,430
with all the people involved without

145
00:06:30,030 --> 00:06:35,900
pointless meetings and you know 20

146
00:06:32,430 --> 00:06:37,680
people on a conference call yeah

147
00:06:35,900 --> 00:06:39,989
automation has been mentioned a lot

148
00:06:37,680 --> 00:06:42,750
today and automation is a good I

149
00:06:39,990 --> 00:06:45,030
but automation just means you can screw

150
00:06:42,750 --> 00:06:46,320
everything up at once you if anything is

151
00:06:45,030 --> 00:06:49,830
compromised you can compromise

152
00:06:46,320 --> 00:06:53,010
everything at once you need that smart

153
00:06:49,830 --> 00:06:54,690
human intervention to stop all the

154
00:06:53,010 --> 00:06:56,630
dominoes falling over you need that's

155
00:06:54,690 --> 00:06:59,910
what you need security people for

156
00:06:56,630 --> 00:07:03,090
automation just fails too fast it's

157
00:06:59,910 --> 00:07:05,280
another thousand points yeah I'm not

158
00:07:03,090 --> 00:07:07,140
doing real well in my um oh yeah okay

159
00:07:05,280 --> 00:07:09,150
I'll take your point and their opinions

160
00:07:07,140 --> 00:07:10,620
interesting cases where automation I

161
00:07:09,150 --> 00:07:13,380
think Google have had some interesting

162
00:07:10,620 --> 00:07:17,550
outages due to deploying stuff a little

163
00:07:13,380 --> 00:07:20,219
bit too fast but you can break things at

164
00:07:17,550 --> 00:07:23,220
scale but it also means you can react at

165
00:07:20,220 --> 00:07:25,230
scale as well you can detect and

166
00:07:23,220 --> 00:07:27,090
automatically respond and even rollback

167
00:07:25,230 --> 00:07:29,820
changes automatically again through

168
00:07:27,090 --> 00:07:33,510
automation so and and don't forget I

169
00:07:29,820 --> 00:07:35,280
mean classic it XKCD you can still

170
00:07:33,510 --> 00:07:36,690
really really break things manually you

171
00:07:35,280 --> 00:07:37,979
know you're only after if you've five

172
00:07:36,690 --> 00:07:39,780
o'clock in the morning you've been doing

173
00:07:37,980 --> 00:07:41,760
a release for two hours that's been

174
00:07:39,780 --> 00:07:43,950
waiting for six months copying and

175
00:07:41,760 --> 00:07:45,510
pasting from a word document into you

176
00:07:43,950 --> 00:07:46,680
know bash terminal or whatever you copy

177
00:07:45,510 --> 00:07:48,390
the wrong thing for you know you've got

178
00:07:46,680 --> 00:07:50,670
a good drop table or something like that

179
00:07:48,390 --> 00:07:51,960
or you've screwed something up and that

180
00:07:50,670 --> 00:07:54,300
could take down an entire service as

181
00:07:51,960 --> 00:07:55,830
well I think game with automation at

182
00:07:54,300 --> 00:07:57,600
least you can remediate that problem

183
00:07:55,830 --> 00:07:59,190
quickly enough you maybe get a few

184
00:07:57,600 --> 00:08:02,490
arrows maybe the users see a bit of

185
00:07:59,190 --> 00:08:05,969
downtime but you have to accept kind of

186
00:08:02,490 --> 00:08:07,920
some level of risk you have to accept

187
00:08:05,970 --> 00:08:10,260
some level of risk this is security

188
00:08:07,920 --> 00:08:12,780
failure is not an option that's a

189
00:08:10,260 --> 00:08:15,539
central tenet of security is hopefully

190
00:08:12,780 --> 00:08:17,190
the security people in here no security

191
00:08:15,540 --> 00:08:19,050
you can't fail you get fired your

192
00:08:17,190 --> 00:08:21,870
organization goes down you get

193
00:08:19,050 --> 00:08:26,880
completely hacked it's 2,000 points

194
00:08:21,870 --> 00:08:34,140
that's so obvious razor I heart but I'm

195
00:08:26,880 --> 00:08:38,340
appalled yes failure is inevitable you

196
00:08:34,140 --> 00:08:40,819
you can't avoid it to some extent you

197
00:08:38,340 --> 00:08:44,550
you your options are you either pretend

198
00:08:40,820 --> 00:08:46,740
it's not going to happen to you and sort

199
00:08:44,550 --> 00:08:49,079
of finger in your ears lalalalala or you

200
00:08:46,740 --> 00:08:51,720
embrace it and try to use that failure

201
00:08:49,080 --> 00:08:53,850
to your advantage find a way to you know

202
00:08:51,720 --> 00:08:58,139
do things that velocity and accept those

203
00:08:53,850 --> 00:08:59,850
risk of failure accept failure all these

204
00:08:58,139 --> 00:09:02,579
companies accepted failure some of them

205
00:08:59,850 --> 00:09:07,740
now exists some of them don't you can

206
00:09:02,579 --> 00:09:10,079
just you just can't exasperated earlier

207
00:09:07,740 --> 00:09:14,100
yahoo has been mentioned frightened over

208
00:09:10,079 --> 00:09:16,008
sick of time today you can't fail people

209
00:09:14,100 --> 00:09:19,139
get fired people lose their livelihood

210
00:09:16,009 --> 00:09:26,100
people lose their data as i said we

211
00:09:19,139 --> 00:09:28,860
can't fail 2000 points if you all right

212
00:09:26,100 --> 00:09:31,350
so those organizations you know what are

213
00:09:28,860 --> 00:09:33,980
you suggesting they didn't they you just

214
00:09:31,350 --> 00:09:37,709
for security you just need to add more

215
00:09:33,980 --> 00:09:40,829
resources more people more technology

216
00:09:37,709 --> 00:09:43,589
more information more threat

217
00:09:40,829 --> 00:09:46,829
intelligence just more stuff and cyber

218
00:09:43,589 --> 00:09:51,230
security will finally work throwing more

219
00:09:46,829 --> 00:09:53,699
like a more less than throwing more

220
00:09:51,230 --> 00:09:55,709
people resources and things like that at

221
00:09:53,699 --> 00:09:57,449
ineffective processes you know isn't

222
00:09:55,709 --> 00:09:59,099
gonna work that's like trying to find a

223
00:09:57,449 --> 00:10:01,469
needle in a haystack by adding more hey

224
00:09:59,100 --> 00:10:02,399
it's fundamentally going to be it's not

225
00:10:01,470 --> 00:10:05,509
going to work it's not going to scale

226
00:10:02,399 --> 00:10:08,910
it's going to be a bad time basically

227
00:10:05,509 --> 00:10:11,939
the security again the central tenet is

228
00:10:08,910 --> 00:10:16,680
the strength of any security process is

229
00:10:11,939 --> 00:10:20,069
as strong as its weakest link so you

230
00:10:16,680 --> 00:10:24,000
just we can't fail I kept saying it

231
00:10:20,069 --> 00:10:27,089
until you listen that's another 2,000

232
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:28,740
points is a tricked you don't I mean and

233
00:10:27,089 --> 00:10:30,870
you just don't understand the cyber

234
00:10:28,740 --> 00:10:33,209
environment we're in the cyber risk or

235
00:10:30,870 --> 00:10:35,009
exposed to the cyber intelligence we

236
00:10:33,209 --> 00:10:37,290
need to understand the cyber threat

237
00:10:35,009 --> 00:10:38,759
intelligence from the cyber threat in

238
00:10:37,290 --> 00:10:40,920
their hoodies which have seen far too

239
00:10:38,759 --> 00:10:42,930
much I've around today I have noticed

240
00:10:40,920 --> 00:10:46,019
I'm the only properly dressed person in

241
00:10:42,930 --> 00:10:50,189
this entire benefit the cybercrime and

242
00:10:46,019 --> 00:10:53,550
of course the hoodie way in binary globe

243
00:10:50,189 --> 00:10:55,980
faced cyber threats that we're all up

244
00:10:53,550 --> 00:10:59,670
again there's just lots of cyber you

245
00:10:55,980 --> 00:11:02,490
have to deal with Fraser another 2,000

246
00:10:59,670 --> 00:11:04,079
points and also I mean as was mentioned

247
00:11:02,490 --> 00:11:06,240
in the keynote you've got things like

248
00:11:04,079 --> 00:11:07,439
well you've got auditors you've got the

249
00:11:06,240 --> 00:11:09,390
insider threat and the

250
00:11:07,440 --> 00:11:11,180
along with auditors is of course that

251
00:11:09,390 --> 00:11:13,590
they're using lots of different

252
00:11:11,180 --> 00:11:16,620
intersecting sort of the same but sort

253
00:11:13,590 --> 00:11:19,200
of conflicting compliance regimes as

254
00:11:16,620 --> 00:11:21,060
well as that you've got an every

255
00:11:19,200 --> 00:11:23,910
increase in attack surface which needs

256
00:11:21,060 --> 00:11:25,349
to be reduced all the time and as well

257
00:11:23,910 --> 00:11:28,530
as everything I mentioned before as a

258
00:11:25,350 --> 00:11:30,990
cybersecurity person I have to deal with

259
00:11:28,530 --> 00:11:33,750
all of this so I don't have time for

260
00:11:30,990 --> 00:11:35,580
this management fad of can't we all talk

261
00:11:33,750 --> 00:11:37,950
to each other and let's be friends we

262
00:11:35,580 --> 00:11:40,170
need to get on throw more resources at

263
00:11:37,950 --> 00:11:42,690
cybersecurity there's just no time you

264
00:11:40,170 --> 00:11:45,349
call that a thousand points you may

265
00:11:42,690 --> 00:11:48,960
notice I've got clicker as well as

266
00:11:45,350 --> 00:11:51,930
they've binary faced hoodie wearing

267
00:11:48,960 --> 00:11:53,910
cyber threats as well developers do a

268
00:11:51,930 --> 00:11:56,189
really good job your opponents are

269
00:11:53,910 --> 00:11:58,050
mainly yourselves though their mistakes

270
00:11:56,190 --> 00:12:00,630
in code or their issues with just the

271
00:11:58,050 --> 00:12:02,300
way code is written or code is designed

272
00:12:00,630 --> 00:12:04,380
there are issues with the way

273
00:12:02,300 --> 00:12:07,650
infrastructure operates your main

274
00:12:04,380 --> 00:12:09,810
opponent is complexity the cybersecurity

275
00:12:07,650 --> 00:12:12,540
your main opponent is a sentient

276
00:12:09,810 --> 00:12:15,390
opponent who's actively looking at what

277
00:12:12,540 --> 00:12:17,370
you do and thinking intelligently how to

278
00:12:15,390 --> 00:12:21,480
attack it it's a completely different

279
00:12:17,370 --> 00:12:25,380
kind of adversarial situation a thousand

280
00:12:21,480 --> 00:12:27,630
points for that one also I'm glad you

281
00:12:25,380 --> 00:12:29,460
didn't even try to interrupt as a cyber

282
00:12:27,630 --> 00:12:31,320
security person I mean I've got to

283
00:12:29,460 --> 00:12:33,780
manage internet firewalls internal

284
00:12:31,320 --> 00:12:35,730
facing firewalls the ingress and egress

285
00:12:33,780 --> 00:12:37,829
rules for all of these because

286
00:12:35,730 --> 00:12:39,960
unfortunately I have to let users talk

287
00:12:37,830 --> 00:12:42,120
to each other I've got to have hardened

288
00:12:39,960 --> 00:12:45,570
proxies in place as well I've also got

289
00:12:42,120 --> 00:12:48,060
encrypt data on the endpoints I've also

290
00:12:45,570 --> 00:12:49,770
got to have antivirus and the new name

291
00:12:48,060 --> 00:12:52,290
for antivirus endpoint threat protection

292
00:12:49,770 --> 00:12:53,910
there's all of this is feeding into my

293
00:12:52,290 --> 00:12:56,339
security incident and event management

294
00:12:53,910 --> 00:12:58,680
system so that people can look at it

295
00:12:56,339 --> 00:13:01,410
look at all that data and try and find

296
00:12:58,680 --> 00:13:03,630
patterns so this is what I've got to

297
00:13:01,410 --> 00:13:06,120
manage with all my special security

298
00:13:03,630 --> 00:13:07,620
staff and also then I've got sock

299
00:13:06,120 --> 00:13:09,960
analyst looking at this and then I'm

300
00:13:07,620 --> 00:13:12,330
given a hunt team a hunt team wants to

301
00:13:09,960 --> 00:13:15,300
look at the raw information so they want

302
00:13:12,330 --> 00:13:17,460
a data Lake Fraser I don't even know

303
00:13:15,300 --> 00:13:20,880
what later lake is but I need to have

304
00:13:17,460 --> 00:13:25,770
one there's nothing special specialist

305
00:13:20,880 --> 00:13:27,840
need double point 28,000 points I'm

306
00:13:25,770 --> 00:13:30,770
saying I'm saying no reason for you to

307
00:13:27,840 --> 00:13:33,450
have any points at all so far thanks um

308
00:13:30,770 --> 00:13:39,439
stop is maybe what you should just yeah

309
00:13:33,450 --> 00:13:41,400
yeah exactly that's great everything but

310
00:13:39,440 --> 00:13:43,490
well I think what you're suggesting is

311
00:13:41,400 --> 00:13:45,390
security needs to be absolutely

312
00:13:43,490 --> 00:13:47,040
everywhere in every part of the

313
00:13:45,390 --> 00:13:50,939
organization and involved in every

314
00:13:47,040 --> 00:13:52,319
single way you could that again as I

315
00:13:50,940 --> 00:13:54,900
said and as we've heard throughout the

316
00:13:52,320 --> 00:13:56,970
day doesn't scale you know you security

317
00:13:54,900 --> 00:14:00,630
will be a blocker at that point you you

318
00:13:56,970 --> 00:14:02,610
can't expect security to to to have to

319
00:14:00,630 --> 00:14:04,680
give approval to every single decision

320
00:14:02,610 --> 00:14:07,050
made throughout the entire set one more

321
00:14:04,680 --> 00:14:09,089
resource just getting money start and

322
00:14:07,050 --> 00:14:11,189
I'll will will finally get sober

323
00:14:09,090 --> 00:14:12,990
security sobbed it's only been it's only

324
00:14:11,190 --> 00:14:14,670
been 25 years will get hang of it food

325
00:14:12,990 --> 00:14:15,840
rolling it realistically if you've got

326
00:14:14,670 --> 00:14:17,699
like a hundred developers you probably

327
00:14:15,840 --> 00:14:19,170
only get have like three security

328
00:14:17,700 --> 00:14:21,170
engineers for those you know you can't

329
00:14:19,170 --> 00:14:23,099
have three engineers blocking a hundred

330
00:14:21,170 --> 00:14:24,180
developers because yeah the

331
00:14:23,100 --> 00:14:26,210
organization's going to be at me a

332
00:14:24,180 --> 00:14:30,719
hundred security engineers like a bad

333
00:14:26,210 --> 00:14:32,100
that's not realistic it anyway yeah I

334
00:14:30,720 --> 00:14:35,790
mean that that's just doesn't work you

335
00:14:32,100 --> 00:14:40,320
can't block everything and what you need

336
00:14:35,790 --> 00:14:42,780
is a security team capital s the

337
00:14:40,320 --> 00:14:44,220
security team just coming in give me

338
00:14:42,780 --> 00:14:46,980
give me those hundred cyber security

339
00:14:44,220 --> 00:14:49,050
engineers to look at all that code look

340
00:14:46,980 --> 00:14:52,410
at all that information look at their

341
00:14:49,050 --> 00:14:54,420
stuff that's going live and just be be

342
00:14:52,410 --> 00:14:55,850
those people who can say no who can

343
00:14:54,420 --> 00:14:59,630
block things you can stop

344
00:14:55,850 --> 00:14:59,630
vulnerabilities appearing on the network

345
00:14:59,660 --> 00:15:05,370
yeah we've heard this I think at least

346
00:15:03,450 --> 00:15:06,300
three times three times today I don't

347
00:15:05,370 --> 00:15:08,490
know if you can actually see it but that

348
00:15:06,300 --> 00:15:12,150
does say the Department of know it's

349
00:15:08,490 --> 00:15:14,190
been disbanded got close but with no is

350
00:15:12,150 --> 00:15:16,230
gone if the Department of no has been

351
00:15:14,190 --> 00:15:18,660
disbanded then the hackers will get in

352
00:15:16,230 --> 00:15:21,510
and everything will be on fire and when

353
00:15:18,660 --> 00:15:27,530
everything is on fire Fraser what you

354
00:15:21,510 --> 00:15:30,030
use to put the fire out but that it's

355
00:15:27,530 --> 00:15:31,560
hackers or things are going to happen

356
00:15:30,030 --> 00:15:34,740
right hackers are going to get in in

357
00:15:31,560 --> 00:15:37,619
some form at some point in some way

358
00:15:34,740 --> 00:15:39,630
it is inevitable you know you're

359
00:15:37,620 --> 00:15:41,130
focusing a lot on the prevention side of

360
00:15:39,630 --> 00:15:43,850
things and if you really want to prevent

361
00:15:41,130 --> 00:15:46,380
security again you heard that today

362
00:15:43,850 --> 00:15:47,640
switch the device off bury it in six

363
00:15:46,380 --> 00:15:49,200
feet of concrete that's the only way you

364
00:15:47,640 --> 00:15:50,640
can secure your thing ultimately

365
00:15:49,200 --> 00:15:52,140
otherwise you have to accept that people

366
00:15:50,640 --> 00:15:53,490
are going to get in Europe at the moment

367
00:15:52,140 --> 00:15:55,709
you're completely ignoring things like

368
00:15:53,490 --> 00:15:58,830
the detection and containment and the

369
00:15:55,709 --> 00:16:00,420
remediation process where you're

370
00:15:58,830 --> 00:16:03,240
accepting a level of risk of people

371
00:16:00,420 --> 00:16:06,060
coming in you can't you know overdo the

372
00:16:03,240 --> 00:16:08,310
security in one aspect you know what

373
00:16:06,060 --> 00:16:10,800
he'll do I priority police response on

374
00:16:08,310 --> 00:16:16,649
garbage it's good there are native

375
00:16:10,800 --> 00:16:18,329
monitors monolith yeah yeah so yeah you

376
00:16:16,649 --> 00:16:20,700
hackers are going to get in you have to

377
00:16:18,330 --> 00:16:24,390
you have to be a little bit more dynamic

378
00:16:20,700 --> 00:16:26,520
and how you approach your risk ok if I'm

379
00:16:24,390 --> 00:16:28,860
going to drag myself out of a 90s

380
00:16:26,520 --> 00:16:32,610
security stereotype it is all about

381
00:16:28,860 --> 00:16:35,070
react but react needs to just understand

382
00:16:32,610 --> 00:16:38,279
the amount of information a security

383
00:16:35,070 --> 00:16:41,339
team will receive you need long and deep

384
00:16:38,279 --> 00:16:44,300
contemplation of security logs security

385
00:16:41,339 --> 00:16:47,270
information vulnerability feeds from

386
00:16:44,300 --> 00:16:49,560
experience and thankfully expensive

387
00:16:47,270 --> 00:16:52,800
consultants like myself really the way

388
00:16:49,560 --> 00:16:54,779
to go dev ops I mean the thing just what

389
00:16:52,800 --> 00:16:57,689
I've heard most today I mean DevOps it's

390
00:16:54,779 --> 00:16:58,920
all about speed velocity like I said

391
00:16:57,690 --> 00:17:00,690
about referring to the Internet of

392
00:16:58,920 --> 00:17:04,790
Things it's all about the rep the push

393
00:17:00,690 --> 00:17:09,420
to make things live just uh basically

394
00:17:04,790 --> 00:17:11,010
slow down is what DevOps needs to do the

395
00:17:09,420 --> 00:17:13,439
way we've been doing it so far it's

396
00:17:11,010 --> 00:17:17,750
worked ok so far we just need like I

397
00:17:13,439 --> 00:17:22,040
keep saying lots more resources somehow

398
00:17:17,750 --> 00:17:25,709
it's just too quick I'll give myself

399
00:17:22,040 --> 00:17:28,649
3337 points for that I think out very

400
00:17:25,709 --> 00:17:30,990
generous of you all right let's take a

401
00:17:28,650 --> 00:17:33,960
step back actually surprised I haven't

402
00:17:30,990 --> 00:17:36,480
heard this mention today so Google have

403
00:17:33,960 --> 00:17:39,300
the concept of an error budget and the

404
00:17:36,480 --> 00:17:40,980
idea of an error budget is to align the

405
00:17:39,300 --> 00:17:43,590
deployment deals with the operations

406
00:17:40,980 --> 00:17:46,169
teams so you define your your arrow

407
00:17:43,590 --> 00:17:47,820
budget is 1 minus the SLA for a given

408
00:17:46,169 --> 00:17:48,690
surface you know if it's particularly

409
00:17:47,820 --> 00:17:52,019
important you

410
00:17:48,690 --> 00:17:54,149
ethically large SLA but that's that's

411
00:17:52,019 --> 00:17:58,799
your kind of wiggle room for getting

412
00:17:54,149 --> 00:18:01,080
stuff done you take your arrow budget

413
00:17:58,799 --> 00:18:02,549
and you take how much down time you've

414
00:18:01,080 --> 00:18:04,379
had so your availability that's a per

415
00:18:02,549 --> 00:18:06,389
quarter subtract the two and that's how

416
00:18:04,379 --> 00:18:08,549
much spend you've got left in your in

417
00:18:06,389 --> 00:18:09,959
your sort of error budget so if a

418
00:18:08,549 --> 00:18:12,269
development team has had a particularly

419
00:18:09,960 --> 00:18:13,889
bad quarter let's say and they've had a

420
00:18:12,269 --> 00:18:16,080
lot of downtime in their product in

421
00:18:13,889 --> 00:18:18,090
their service they would have spent

422
00:18:16,080 --> 00:18:19,289
their error budget and you know they

423
00:18:18,090 --> 00:18:22,168
have to slow down that deployment

424
00:18:19,289 --> 00:18:25,200
process probably by writing more tests

425
00:18:22,169 --> 00:18:26,549
or maybe better tests but conversely if

426
00:18:25,200 --> 00:18:29,309
they haven't spent that budget then

427
00:18:26,549 --> 00:18:30,870
thats budgets gone to waste so maybe

428
00:18:29,309 --> 00:18:32,879
they should have written fewer tests for

429
00:18:30,870 --> 00:18:35,789
ironically or you know just tried to

430
00:18:32,879 --> 00:18:38,189
innovate more potato more risks because

431
00:18:35,789 --> 00:18:39,269
you know Google's opinion is that you

432
00:18:38,190 --> 00:18:42,929
don't need a hundred percent

433
00:18:39,269 --> 00:18:44,850
availability because it's unrealistic

434
00:18:42,929 --> 00:18:46,799
you know users would notice that so

435
00:18:44,850 --> 00:18:49,019
let's find that balance that incentivize

436
00:18:46,799 --> 00:18:53,070
both operations and development teams to

437
00:18:49,019 --> 00:18:54,980
the same figure that some reason off it

438
00:18:53,070 --> 00:18:57,240
sounds reasonable but the thing with

439
00:18:54,980 --> 00:18:59,129
availabilities it's really easy to

440
00:18:57,240 --> 00:19:02,279
measure stuffs either up or down it's

441
00:18:59,129 --> 00:19:03,299
either on or off I mean like I say I

442
00:19:02,279 --> 00:19:05,399
have actually been paying attention

443
00:19:03,299 --> 00:19:07,918
today like Mike Milner made really good

444
00:19:05,399 --> 00:19:10,168
points earlier but the up from the

445
00:19:07,919 --> 00:19:13,350
operational side it's just it's up or

446
00:19:10,169 --> 00:19:16,379
down brilliant yeah use that SLA is

447
00:19:13,350 --> 00:19:19,019
great maybe deploy a bit faster if it

448
00:19:16,379 --> 00:19:22,049
supports that but security is much more

449
00:19:19,019 --> 00:19:23,519
intricate and complex and difficult to

450
00:19:22,049 --> 00:19:27,418
understand as people have mentioned

451
00:19:23,519 --> 00:19:29,100
today you can't analyze this with a tool

452
00:19:27,419 --> 00:19:31,710
people have made some suggestions but

453
00:19:29,100 --> 00:19:33,240
there's no obvious tool out there where

454
00:19:31,710 --> 00:19:35,730
just the security posture and

455
00:19:33,240 --> 00:19:37,860
organization will make sense all right

456
00:19:35,730 --> 00:19:40,820
so bearing in mind the risk budget

457
00:19:37,860 --> 00:19:42,840
absite the risk budget the error budget

458
00:19:40,820 --> 00:19:45,689
what if you could to find something like

459
00:19:42,840 --> 00:19:49,709
risk budget so the idea would be you add

460
00:19:45,690 --> 00:19:53,129
a line for security with the DevOps

461
00:19:49,710 --> 00:19:55,679
velocity just done any reasonable k soon

462
00:19:53,129 --> 00:19:56,850
as I've got such a elite score which a

463
00:19:55,679 --> 00:19:59,369
few people in the audience should

464
00:19:56,850 --> 00:20:00,990
understand I'll let you go ahead what's

465
00:19:59,369 --> 00:20:03,970
a risk but

466
00:20:00,990 --> 00:20:07,360
again lots of stuff covered this today

467
00:20:03,970 --> 00:20:09,070
already your organization probably has

468
00:20:07,360 --> 00:20:11,379
different ways of measuring risk already

469
00:20:09,070 --> 00:20:15,070
and if you've got pipelines and you've

470
00:20:11,380 --> 00:20:16,840
got things as code you're really doing

471
00:20:15,070 --> 00:20:19,360
most of this out of the documentation

472
00:20:16,840 --> 00:20:21,309
coverage if you've if you've got

473
00:20:19,360 --> 00:20:23,830
documentation embedded into your code or

474
00:20:21,309 --> 00:20:25,360
you've got external documentation how

475
00:20:23,830 --> 00:20:29,289
much and how well your stuff is

476
00:20:25,360 --> 00:20:31,209
documented is you know is something you

477
00:20:29,289 --> 00:20:32,440
can measure unit test coverage unit test

478
00:20:31,210 --> 00:20:34,240
results integration test coverage

479
00:20:32,440 --> 00:20:37,000
integration test results all of these

480
00:20:34,240 --> 00:20:38,679
basically help define the quality of the

481
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:39,850
the product or service and the

482
00:20:38,679 --> 00:20:42,850
assumption here is that if you've got a

483
00:20:39,850 --> 00:20:44,379
high quality from a software engineering

484
00:20:42,850 --> 00:20:46,000
point of view product or service you'll

485
00:20:44,380 --> 00:20:48,789
so probably have quite a high security

486
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:51,130
quality product or service but we've

487
00:20:48,789 --> 00:20:52,960
also do other stuff as well again heard

488
00:20:51,130 --> 00:20:55,919
lots of this today continuous security

489
00:20:52,960 --> 00:20:59,020
testing if you're running BDD security

490
00:20:55,919 --> 00:21:01,659
measure the output add that to some sort

491
00:20:59,020 --> 00:21:05,049
of risk equation maybe you can do Co

492
00:21:01,659 --> 00:21:06,070
driven threat modeling levels of ink

493
00:21:05,049 --> 00:21:07,870
scruton Gator that's quite an

494
00:21:06,070 --> 00:21:09,850
interesting idea if you can measure how

495
00:21:07,870 --> 00:21:13,330
early and how much you get security

496
00:21:09,850 --> 00:21:15,039
involved in the development process if

497
00:21:13,330 --> 00:21:17,139
you can measure that you can sort of

498
00:21:15,039 --> 00:21:19,990
count that towards a risk calculation

499
00:21:17,140 --> 00:21:21,580
pen test results and again the idea if

500
00:21:19,990 --> 00:21:23,740
you've got gated passes to production

501
00:21:21,580 --> 00:21:28,240
you could maybe look at the percentage

502
00:21:23,740 --> 00:21:31,720
of successful deployments to the

503
00:21:28,240 --> 00:21:36,850
production as another risk metric why

504
00:21:31,720 --> 00:21:37,780
would you do all this well let's take an

505
00:21:36,850 --> 00:21:41,289
example let's say you've got a

506
00:21:37,780 --> 00:21:43,510
particular service that you want to get

507
00:21:41,289 --> 00:21:45,190
to production and you look at how

508
00:21:43,510 --> 00:21:47,620
important what sort of data it has in it

509
00:21:45,190 --> 00:21:49,960
and you arbitrarily give it an X number

510
00:21:47,620 --> 00:21:52,870
of risk budget points per quarter let's

511
00:21:49,960 --> 00:21:54,460
say so before they're sort of state

512
00:21:52,870 --> 00:21:55,600
might may have looked like this they

513
00:21:54,460 --> 00:21:57,039
didn't bother getting security involved

514
00:21:55,600 --> 00:21:59,678
earlier on in the process so that cost

515
00:21:57,039 --> 00:22:01,210
them like 50 points for a production

516
00:21:59,679 --> 00:22:03,220
deployment nicer right more or

517
00:22:01,210 --> 00:22:04,630
whatsoever that costs 100 points the

518
00:22:03,220 --> 00:22:06,580
pretty good documentation maybe that

519
00:22:04,630 --> 00:22:09,669
only costs in 10 points good test

520
00:22:06,580 --> 00:22:11,470
results no security tests that's going

521
00:22:09,669 --> 00:22:13,610
to cost them another hundred points good

522
00:22:11,470 --> 00:22:15,710
gate rate and again no pen test

523
00:22:13,610 --> 00:22:19,100
another hundred points so if we sort of

524
00:22:15,710 --> 00:22:20,929
total these up you end up with 400

525
00:22:19,100 --> 00:22:22,760
points per production deployment which

526
00:22:20,929 --> 00:22:24,710
if you've got a risk budget of a

527
00:22:22,760 --> 00:22:26,030
thousand points let's say that's only

528
00:22:24,710 --> 00:22:27,590
two deployments per quarter it's not

529
00:22:26,030 --> 00:22:30,110
particularly agile as if it's it's

530
00:22:27,590 --> 00:22:31,879
pretty pretty bad but what you've done

531
00:22:30,110 --> 00:22:33,500
is you've it basically incentivize them

532
00:22:31,880 --> 00:22:35,480
to improve their security posture so

533
00:22:33,500 --> 00:22:36,920
maybe they sort of sit down scratch

534
00:22:35,480 --> 00:22:37,940
their heads think you know we want to

535
00:22:36,920 --> 00:22:40,160
get things out the door a little bit

536
00:22:37,940 --> 00:22:42,970
faster how can we do that you've

537
00:22:40,160 --> 00:22:46,700
basically aligned them to your

538
00:22:42,970 --> 00:22:48,799
requirement this time around they get

539
00:22:46,700 --> 00:22:50,179
security involved a lot earlier and took

540
00:22:48,799 --> 00:22:51,679
the larger extent maybe security attends

541
00:22:50,179 --> 00:22:54,169
the stand ups and stuff so they've gone

542
00:22:51,679 --> 00:22:57,080
down from 50 points for deployment down

543
00:22:54,169 --> 00:22:59,240
to 10 basic set model maybe it's not

544
00:22:57,080 --> 00:23:00,649
dynamic maybe it's not generated but

545
00:22:59,240 --> 00:23:03,890
maybe it's just a like a security

546
00:23:00,650 --> 00:23:05,330
markdown file in the root repository at

547
00:23:03,890 --> 00:23:07,760
least it's shaped off a few points

548
00:23:05,330 --> 00:23:09,260
documentation blah blah blah screw

549
00:23:07,760 --> 00:23:12,530
t-tests they've managed to shave off and

550
00:23:09,260 --> 00:23:14,000
other 80 points on the deployment by

551
00:23:12,530 --> 00:23:15,320
writing security tests it's something

552
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:16,820
that can be measured something we

553
00:23:15,320 --> 00:23:18,409
tracked something could be calculated

554
00:23:16,820 --> 00:23:21,260
and they've got a pen test result let's

555
00:23:18,410 --> 00:23:22,669
say pretty good maybe not perfect but at

556
00:23:21,260 --> 00:23:27,110
least it reduced the points so if you

557
00:23:22,669 --> 00:23:28,760
total those up it's now 155 points for a

558
00:23:27,110 --> 00:23:32,809
deployment that lets them deploy every

559
00:23:28,760 --> 00:23:34,520
two weeks and again automation is key

560
00:23:32,809 --> 00:23:36,710
here this isn't a manual process this

561
00:23:34,520 --> 00:23:38,900
isn't a spreadsheet or something like

562
00:23:36,710 --> 00:23:42,280
that you would implement this as a

563
00:23:38,900 --> 00:23:45,290
gating process to deployment so

564
00:23:42,280 --> 00:23:47,840
developers you know they build a test in

565
00:23:45,290 --> 00:23:49,340
a staging environment it's you know they

566
00:23:47,840 --> 00:23:50,990
can have a big red button that says

567
00:23:49,340 --> 00:23:52,280
you're not going to get this through to

568
00:23:50,990 --> 00:23:58,370
production because you haven't got

569
00:23:52,280 --> 00:23:59,720
enough points so yeah I mean an

570
00:23:58,370 --> 00:24:03,610
interesting approach and a different

571
00:23:59,720 --> 00:24:07,010
approach yeah I mean it's from this

572
00:24:03,610 --> 00:24:10,370
you've obviously thought about it from

573
00:24:07,010 --> 00:24:12,230
and to not be the cliche from my

574
00:24:10,370 --> 00:24:15,918
original thoughts on this I was like 50

575
00:24:12,230 --> 00:24:17,510
50 on DevOps but talking to Fraser

576
00:24:15,919 --> 00:24:20,330
putting together the talk that they were

577
00:24:17,510 --> 00:24:21,710
putting remor to the left so this you're

578
00:24:20,330 --> 00:24:25,220
actually thinking about securities you

579
00:24:21,710 --> 00:24:26,750
go along if it's not secure you stop if

580
00:24:25,220 --> 00:24:27,440
it is secure you keep going if it's not

581
00:24:26,750 --> 00:24:30,320
secure used

582
00:24:27,440 --> 00:24:33,200
really secure you keep going almost

583
00:24:30,320 --> 00:24:35,389
that's the slightly absolutist think

584
00:24:33,200 --> 00:24:37,789
more of less security person being a

585
00:24:35,389 --> 00:24:39,289
traitor more secure and less secure

586
00:24:37,789 --> 00:24:41,809
again it's about the risk side and if

587
00:24:39,289 --> 00:24:43,039
you think about it you know developers

588
00:24:41,809 --> 00:24:44,779
like we've heard the word today as well

589
00:24:43,039 --> 00:24:47,779
development teams and DevOps and stuff

590
00:24:44,779 --> 00:24:49,639
works with value and you know they are

591
00:24:47,779 --> 00:24:51,679
going to write a feature because there's

592
00:24:49,639 --> 00:24:53,719
a high likelihood that pic feature is

593
00:24:51,679 --> 00:24:56,539
going to have a positive impact on that

594
00:24:53,720 --> 00:24:58,789
say you know the number of sales or the

595
00:24:56,539 --> 00:25:00,860
number of users you know whatever the

596
00:24:58,789 --> 00:25:03,740
key metrics are that sounds a lot like

597
00:25:00,860 --> 00:25:06,709
risk to some extent doesn't it yeah

598
00:25:03,740 --> 00:25:08,419
certainly I mean in this partly because

599
00:25:06,710 --> 00:25:10,460
we run out of time looking at the clock

600
00:25:08,419 --> 00:25:12,320
for today partly because we're running

601
00:25:10,460 --> 00:25:13,700
out of time because cyber security

602
00:25:12,320 --> 00:25:15,889
people have been trying the same thing

603
00:25:13,700 --> 00:25:18,710
for the twenty odd years I've been doing

604
00:25:15,889 --> 00:25:20,629
it and all we can say is just give us

605
00:25:18,710 --> 00:25:23,269
more into the process and will finally

606
00:25:20,629 --> 00:25:26,299
make it work I can see the two sides

607
00:25:23,269 --> 00:25:28,120
risk is a negative beginning negative

608
00:25:26,299 --> 00:25:30,529
beginning point of view that's negative

609
00:25:28,120 --> 00:25:32,539
impact times likelihood of negative

610
00:25:30,529 --> 00:25:35,120
things but from a developer site in the

611
00:25:32,539 --> 00:25:36,950
DevOps point of view it's just impact

612
00:25:35,120 --> 00:25:39,590
times likelihood of the positive effect

613
00:25:36,950 --> 00:25:42,970
of releasing code and effectively it's

614
00:25:39,590 --> 00:25:45,559
it's looking at the same problem from

615
00:25:42,970 --> 00:25:51,740
from two different sides but looking at

616
00:25:45,559 --> 00:25:55,730
it in the same way yeah exactly it is

617
00:25:51,740 --> 00:25:58,789
all very sort of yin-yang two opposing

618
00:25:55,730 --> 00:26:00,830
sides coexisting two sides of the same

619
00:25:58,789 --> 00:26:03,860
coin you know positive value and

620
00:26:00,830 --> 00:26:07,100
negative risk are essentially two of the

621
00:26:03,860 --> 00:26:11,178
same things if you sort of look at it

622
00:26:07,100 --> 00:26:14,779
slightly more philosophically develop

623
00:26:11,179 --> 00:26:17,360
that looks horrific battle no it's

624
00:26:14,779 --> 00:26:20,269
better on my laptop screen and so DevOps

625
00:26:17,360 --> 00:26:21,769
has to take into account the negative

626
00:26:20,269 --> 00:26:23,690
side of human nature it cannot ignore

627
00:26:21,769 --> 00:26:27,679
security it has to take responsibility

628
00:26:23,690 --> 00:26:31,159
for security and accept that it is there

629
00:26:27,679 --> 00:26:33,769
a job to to accept that there are bad

630
00:26:31,159 --> 00:26:37,190
people out there and they sometimes are

631
00:26:33,769 --> 00:26:40,580
out to get you but at the same time and

632
00:26:37,190 --> 00:26:41,180
we again we've heard this today security

633
00:26:40,580 --> 00:26:42,649
has to you

634
00:26:41,180 --> 00:26:44,480
july's the human at the positive human

635
00:26:42,650 --> 00:26:48,530
side of human nature you know not

636
00:26:44,480 --> 00:26:50,540
everyone is out there to get you shift

637
00:26:48,530 --> 00:26:52,580
it left distribute that responsibility

638
00:26:50,540 --> 00:26:55,639
let the developments and operation seems

639
00:26:52,580 --> 00:26:58,820
do their job building out the security

640
00:26:55,640 --> 00:27:00,500
but have that trust but verify model

641
00:26:58,820 --> 00:27:01,700
have the controls in place just to

642
00:27:00,500 --> 00:27:03,080
ensure that they are doing what they

643
00:27:01,700 --> 00:27:07,240
need to do but then just let them get on

644
00:27:03,080 --> 00:27:10,580
with it yeah absolutely i mean this is i

645
00:27:07,240 --> 00:27:12,110
mean just what i've heard today and what

646
00:27:10,580 --> 00:27:14,570
i've heard everybody saying today just

647
00:27:12,110 --> 00:27:16,189
the whole push it to the left social

648
00:27:14,570 --> 00:27:18,200
security gets involved earlier we were

649
00:27:16,190 --> 00:27:20,120
discussing earlier today like the

650
00:27:18,200 --> 00:27:21,950
difference in cost between remediating

651
00:27:20,120 --> 00:27:23,929
issues early and remediating them at

652
00:27:21,950 --> 00:27:25,790
that that last possible moment when you

653
00:27:23,930 --> 00:27:27,320
realize you just have to talk to the

654
00:27:25,790 --> 00:27:28,909
security team you can't avoid it any

655
00:27:27,320 --> 00:27:30,290
longer and then if they find a

656
00:27:28,910 --> 00:27:32,240
fundamental issue you have to change

657
00:27:30,290 --> 00:27:35,540
everything so push it all the way to the

658
00:27:32,240 --> 00:27:36,560
left them in something Marcus Pinto

659
00:27:35,540 --> 00:27:40,010
mentioned earlier I really like the

660
00:27:36,560 --> 00:27:41,899
phrase embedded security expertise so

661
00:27:40,010 --> 00:27:43,670
that everybody's involved with security

662
00:27:41,900 --> 00:27:46,880
and everybody understands security which

663
00:27:43,670 --> 00:27:49,190
we've understood again again and sort of

664
00:27:46,880 --> 00:27:52,250
looks right I really like Chris des idea

665
00:27:49,190 --> 00:27:54,430
of Marvins just that army almost of

666
00:27:52,250 --> 00:27:57,680
automatic thoughts inspecting code

667
00:27:54,430 --> 00:28:02,660
raising things doing that first pass

668
00:27:57,680 --> 00:28:05,420
which I mean to use the cliche I forced

669
00:28:02,660 --> 00:28:07,910
into the presentation if there if dev

670
00:28:05,420 --> 00:28:12,110
ops and security work together we all

671
00:28:07,910 --> 00:28:15,110
get the high score we get really get one

672
00:28:12,110 --> 00:28:17,360
cheer for over yes so do the dev ops ii

673
00:28:15,110 --> 00:28:19,280
people in the room be patient with

674
00:28:17,360 --> 00:28:21,260
security they are having to go through a

675
00:28:19,280 --> 00:28:24,139
pretty radical philosophical like

676
00:28:21,260 --> 00:28:26,780
paradigm shift so give them the space

677
00:28:24,140 --> 00:28:28,820
they need to the security people in the

678
00:28:26,780 --> 00:28:31,540
room if you're here to be honest i would

679
00:28:28,820 --> 00:28:35,750
think you understand the value of DevOps

680
00:28:31,540 --> 00:28:37,550
but to to the people you don't just tell

681
00:28:35,750 --> 00:28:40,040
them to be patient and get them talking

682
00:28:37,550 --> 00:28:42,770
to devops people if you get past the

683
00:28:40,040 --> 00:28:46,159
cliches if you think it's all plank

684
00:28:42,770 --> 00:28:48,020
meetings and just smashing developers

685
00:28:46,160 --> 00:28:50,300
and operations together so you pay half

686
00:28:48,020 --> 00:28:51,560
the staff half as much or rather have to

687
00:28:50,300 --> 00:28:53,360
staff twice as much but they have to

688
00:28:51,560 --> 00:28:54,889
work four times as hard I've seen

689
00:28:53,360 --> 00:28:57,590
companies try that before

690
00:28:54,890 --> 00:28:59,840
explain to your security people about

691
00:28:57,590 --> 00:29:03,290
this and get the DevOps people in front

692
00:28:59,840 --> 00:29:05,209
of them as I've learned from talking to

693
00:29:03,290 --> 00:29:07,810
Fraser lucky I was 5050 to Fraser

694
00:29:05,210 --> 00:29:09,710
explained a lot of the concepts to me

695
00:29:07,810 --> 00:29:12,530
there was people have the best

696
00:29:09,710 --> 00:29:15,080
intentions and similarly these ideas are

697
00:29:12,530 --> 00:29:17,149
pretty cool security doesn't have any

698
00:29:15,080 --> 00:29:19,879
really any fresh ideas anymore it's

699
00:29:17,150 --> 00:29:24,560
about you doing the existing ideas but

700
00:29:19,880 --> 00:29:27,320
better from listening to so many of the

701
00:29:24,560 --> 00:29:29,629
talk presentations and people here today

702
00:29:27,320 --> 00:29:32,899
DevOps is a genuinely new way of

703
00:29:29,630 --> 00:29:35,960
approaching this and is the most likely

704
00:29:32,900 --> 00:29:37,040
that i see that will actually work and

705
00:29:35,960 --> 00:29:39,440
don't worry I'm not going to read this

706
00:29:37,040 --> 00:29:43,639
out together to everyone remember

707
00:29:39,440 --> 00:29:46,430
empathy goes both ways we have to find

708
00:29:43,640 --> 00:29:49,880
ways to work together and accept

709
00:29:46,430 --> 00:29:52,730
differences and yeah I mean it's you've

710
00:29:49,880 --> 00:29:54,470
you've said to me the basis of the

711
00:29:52,730 --> 00:29:56,840
culture of DevOps is empathy and

712
00:29:54,470 --> 00:30:00,440
listening to people although it is a

713
00:29:56,840 --> 00:30:02,060
stereotype the basis of security was not

714
00:30:00,440 --> 00:30:05,210
listening to people and telling them

715
00:30:02,060 --> 00:30:09,590
telling users or operations how wrong

716
00:30:05,210 --> 00:30:11,210
they were so gain that empathy and

717
00:30:09,590 --> 00:30:14,110
actually we can improve cybersecurity

718
00:30:11,210 --> 00:30:19,540
and retaining can improve development

719
00:30:14,110 --> 00:30:19,540
yeah thank you thank you very much

720
00:30:22,460 --> 00:30:28,130
probably I'm sequestering whiskey yeah

721
00:30:25,180 --> 00:30:34,520
yup 5-10 minutes i think maybe some

722
00:30:28,130 --> 00:30:38,450
questions no one's no I'm not seeing any

723
00:30:34,520 --> 00:30:41,560
look you know time just sneak out Thanks

724
00:30:38,450 --> 00:30:41,560
okay we're good thank you
