1
00:00:08,389 --> 00:00:11,940
better

2
00:00:09,830 --> 00:00:13,469
alright securely automating

3
00:00:11,940 --> 00:00:15,209
infrastructure in the cloud which should

4
00:00:13,469 --> 00:00:17,759
be close to a lot of your hearts I think

5
00:00:15,210 --> 00:00:20,939
as we start moving to more of a cloud

6
00:00:17,760 --> 00:00:22,230
oriented environment with AWS as your if

7
00:00:20,939 --> 00:00:24,948
you're a little bit longer in the field

8
00:00:22,230 --> 00:00:27,720
Rackspace cloud Google compute engine

9
00:00:24,949 --> 00:00:31,759
and even some of the on-premises

10
00:00:27,720 --> 00:00:37,860
offerings like OpenStack and vSphere or

11
00:00:31,759 --> 00:00:40,590
V cloud so I've been doing this for I

12
00:00:37,860 --> 00:00:44,340
guess just under 25 years at this point

13
00:00:40,590 --> 00:00:46,829
I started my career as developer spent

14
00:00:44,340 --> 00:00:48,600
15 years doing that almost and I've

15
00:00:46,829 --> 00:00:50,789
spent the last two 10 years doing

16
00:00:48,600 --> 00:00:55,800
systems and security architecture and

17
00:00:50,789 --> 00:00:57,210
platform design my expectations for you

18
00:00:55,800 --> 00:00:58,828
guys to walk away with this saying I

19
00:00:57,210 --> 00:01:04,530
already knew that and I feel like most

20
00:00:58,829 --> 00:01:05,939
of you already do I've heard today a lot

21
00:01:04,530 --> 00:01:07,380
about the struggle from the security

22
00:01:05,939 --> 00:01:08,759
side of getting other getting people

23
00:01:07,380 --> 00:01:11,429
involved from the development standpoint

24
00:01:08,760 --> 00:01:13,439
of operations standpoint and I've heard

25
00:01:11,430 --> 00:01:15,509
a lot from the developers about how hard

26
00:01:13,439 --> 00:01:18,960
it is to make security work in your

27
00:01:15,509 --> 00:01:21,240
pipelines this is somewhat about how we

28
00:01:18,960 --> 00:01:25,408
have made that happen where I'm working

29
00:01:21,240 --> 00:01:27,210
now at ICF Olson and I think that it's

30
00:01:25,409 --> 00:01:29,430
sort of a blueprint for how you can work

31
00:01:27,210 --> 00:01:33,389
with your operations teams in order to

32
00:01:29,430 --> 00:01:35,549
get that done so this is not so much a

33
00:01:33,390 --> 00:01:37,560
how-to guide as a how we did it guide

34
00:01:35,549 --> 00:01:39,630
and one of the important things that we

35
00:01:37,560 --> 00:01:41,430
want is for it to be push-button for

36
00:01:39,630 --> 00:01:43,380
everybody even ourselves we don't want

37
00:01:41,430 --> 00:01:45,540
to keep doing the same thing over and

38
00:01:43,380 --> 00:01:47,579
over and over again nobody does it

39
00:01:45,540 --> 00:01:48,720
becomes boring it becomes tedious and

40
00:01:47,579 --> 00:01:54,389
you stopped paying attention to what

41
00:01:48,720 --> 00:01:56,759
you're doing so from the security side

42
00:01:54,390 --> 00:02:00,509
of things everything revolves around the

43
00:01:56,759 --> 00:02:02,310
idea of minimum necessary access and do

44
00:02:00,509 --> 00:02:04,680
it securely or don't do it at all I

45
00:02:02,310 --> 00:02:07,020
haven't heard a whole lot about minimum

46
00:02:04,680 --> 00:02:09,119
necessary access from the private side

47
00:02:07,020 --> 00:02:10,560
of things there's the civilian side of

48
00:02:09,119 --> 00:02:13,569
things it seems to be more of a

49
00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:15,579
government oriented idea but the

50
00:02:13,569 --> 00:02:17,578
is that from an operational standpoint

51
00:02:15,579 --> 00:02:20,170
you really don't want developers

52
00:02:17,579 --> 00:02:22,359
touching your production systems it's

53
00:02:20,170 --> 00:02:24,369
something that every DevOps engineer

54
00:02:22,359 --> 00:02:27,310
every operations person every sysadmin

55
00:02:24,370 --> 00:02:31,000
says it's just you can't track

56
00:02:27,310 --> 00:02:33,189
necessarily what people are doing so but

57
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:35,439
on the opposite side of things as a

58
00:02:33,189 --> 00:02:36,760
developer you need to have that access

59
00:02:35,439 --> 00:02:37,569
you need to get your code out you need

60
00:02:36,760 --> 00:02:38,798
to make sure everything's running

61
00:02:37,569 --> 00:02:45,280
smoothly you need to be able to have

62
00:02:38,799 --> 00:02:47,469
visibility into things so how did we

63
00:02:45,280 --> 00:02:49,870
start going after this we needed to

64
00:02:47,469 --> 00:02:51,459
understand our security space so we

65
00:02:49,870 --> 00:02:53,500
needed to know what we owned what our

66
00:02:51,459 --> 00:02:55,810
partners owned and importantly for my

67
00:02:53,500 --> 00:02:58,030
team we run manage services for a number

68
00:02:55,810 --> 00:02:59,560
of different clients so we're

69
00:02:58,030 --> 00:03:01,480
effectively an extension of their IT

70
00:02:59,560 --> 00:03:03,599
department or replacing their IT

71
00:03:01,480 --> 00:03:06,099
department which means we have a lot of

72
00:03:03,599 --> 00:03:09,578
partnerships with other things that we

73
00:03:06,099 --> 00:03:11,048
might not necessarily work with we tied

74
00:03:09,579 --> 00:03:14,409
directly into a lot of marketing

75
00:03:11,049 --> 00:03:17,129
departments and we tied directly into a

76
00:03:14,409 --> 00:03:20,048
lot of other communications vessels that

77
00:03:17,129 --> 00:03:23,620
normal IT departments don't necessarily

78
00:03:20,049 --> 00:03:25,209
work with we needed to know what they

79
00:03:23,620 --> 00:03:27,250
owned but we also needed to know what

80
00:03:25,209 --> 00:03:31,359
our testing and analysis capabilities

81
00:03:27,250 --> 00:03:33,549
were we also had to ask what don't we

82
00:03:31,359 --> 00:03:34,959
know and that's a hard question to wrap

83
00:03:33,549 --> 00:03:39,040
your brain around if you actually start

84
00:03:34,959 --> 00:03:41,500
diving into that the I don't know what I

85
00:03:39,040 --> 00:03:43,659
don't know circular conundrum becomes a

86
00:03:41,500 --> 00:03:46,180
real problem so we started by mapping

87
00:03:43,659 --> 00:03:47,888
out our common infrastructures the ones

88
00:03:46,180 --> 00:03:50,290
that were common amongst our clients the

89
00:03:47,889 --> 00:03:52,989
ones that were common internally how it

90
00:03:50,290 --> 00:03:56,259
was deployed and what it touched

91
00:03:52,989 --> 00:03:58,389
externally we also needed to know what

92
00:03:56,259 --> 00:04:01,929
tools we were using how we were using

93
00:03:58,389 --> 00:04:04,509
them and who could help us so we needed

94
00:04:01,930 --> 00:04:07,389
to know who our executive allies who our

95
00:04:04,509 --> 00:04:08,798
development allies and who the security

96
00:04:07,389 --> 00:04:11,549
teams were inside of our own

97
00:04:08,799 --> 00:04:11,549
organization

98
00:04:15,090 --> 00:04:21,480
so we found out what we'd built it was

99
00:04:18,660 --> 00:04:23,340
this little thing as a dumpster fire

100
00:04:21,480 --> 00:04:24,720
you guys over here on this side of the

101
00:04:23,340 --> 00:04:25,739
pond tend to talk about tire fires

102
00:04:24,720 --> 00:04:28,590
that's great

103
00:04:25,740 --> 00:04:28,919
we have dumpsters this one was what we

104
00:04:28,590 --> 00:04:30,539
got

105
00:04:28,919 --> 00:04:32,849
we could still toss trash into it and it

106
00:04:30,540 --> 00:04:35,940
was still doing its job but it wasn't

107
00:04:32,850 --> 00:04:38,370
really helpful so what we needed we

108
00:04:35,940 --> 00:04:40,469
needed a an audible an auditable

109
00:04:38,370 --> 00:04:42,720
repeatable process that was integrated

110
00:04:40,470 --> 00:04:44,880
as fully as possible across the

111
00:04:42,720 --> 00:04:46,560
environment so we needed to have it work

112
00:04:44,880 --> 00:04:47,969
from the ground up make sure that all of

113
00:04:46,560 --> 00:04:49,290
our infrastructure was laid out the same

114
00:04:47,970 --> 00:04:50,729
way make sure that once the

115
00:04:49,290 --> 00:04:52,710
infrastructure was up it was monitored

116
00:04:50,729 --> 00:04:54,090
properly make sure that we were logging

117
00:04:52,710 --> 00:04:55,799
all of our alerts making sure that we

118
00:04:54,090 --> 00:04:57,719
had insight into that and then once the

119
00:04:55,800 --> 00:04:59,250
infrastructure was in place making sure

120
00:04:57,720 --> 00:05:00,960
the build pipelines were fully

121
00:04:59,250 --> 00:05:03,150
integrated and tied into that

122
00:05:00,960 --> 00:05:05,400
infrastructure so that our developers

123
00:05:03,150 --> 00:05:07,409
had full access where they needed it and

124
00:05:05,400 --> 00:05:13,440
wouldn't come back to us saying hey I

125
00:05:07,410 --> 00:05:16,200
need root access in production so what

126
00:05:13,440 --> 00:05:21,030
did we keep what did we toss and what

127
00:05:16,200 --> 00:05:23,400
did we need to invent buy or find so

128
00:05:21,030 --> 00:05:26,280
what we had we had configuration

129
00:05:23,400 --> 00:05:30,299
management kind of push f11 we had

130
00:05:26,280 --> 00:05:32,250
monitoring with zabbix good we had

131
00:05:30,300 --> 00:05:34,200
centralized logging on a single node

132
00:05:32,250 --> 00:05:38,460
that tend to fall over from time to time

133
00:05:34,200 --> 00:05:41,250
and we added alerting in the last year

134
00:05:38,460 --> 00:05:43,440
and a half with pager duty so this is

135
00:05:41,250 --> 00:05:45,450
great but except for page or duty this

136
00:05:43,440 --> 00:05:46,669
is basically the cutting edge of 2012

137
00:05:45,450 --> 00:05:50,610
right here

138
00:05:46,669 --> 00:05:57,450
and if you're keeping track chef's 11

139
00:05:50,610 --> 00:05:58,650
was in beta in 2012 so we basically

140
00:05:57,450 --> 00:06:00,599
needed everything we needed better

141
00:05:58,650 --> 00:06:03,570
monitoring we needed better logging we

142
00:06:00,600 --> 00:06:05,389
needed infrastructure automation we

143
00:06:03,570 --> 00:06:07,919
needed better configuration management

144
00:06:05,389 --> 00:06:09,930
we needed auditing and we needed code

145
00:06:07,919 --> 00:06:11,430
management because now we're looking at

146
00:06:09,930 --> 00:06:16,800
representing every single thing in our

147
00:06:11,430 --> 00:06:19,380
infrastructure as a piece of code so we

148
00:06:16,800 --> 00:06:21,180
picked the lists you guys are probably

149
00:06:19,380 --> 00:06:25,770
familiar with almost everything up here

150
00:06:21,180 --> 00:06:28,010
get get lab Jenkins terraform maybe

151
00:06:25,770 --> 00:06:29,310
newer for some of you and Packer

152
00:06:28,010 --> 00:06:32,310
inspects proud

153
00:06:29,310 --> 00:06:34,260
the newest tool on their chef's 12 and

154
00:06:32,310 --> 00:06:36,120
then we went to a full age a cluster for

155
00:06:34,260 --> 00:06:37,710
our logging cents you from Rana Turing

156
00:06:36,120 --> 00:06:43,620
and we stuck with page of duty so we

157
00:06:37,710 --> 00:06:45,590
kept one thing so that's good right so

158
00:06:43,620 --> 00:06:48,630
what about the details

159
00:06:45,590 --> 00:06:52,229
every engineers developer and every

160
00:06:48,630 --> 00:06:54,990
object in the infrastructure is code not

161
00:06:52,230 --> 00:06:57,930
every developer is a drunk but I don't

162
00:06:54,990 --> 00:07:00,180
know as one I feel like I should be and

163
00:06:57,930 --> 00:07:01,680
then the infrastructure was the really

164
00:07:00,180 --> 00:07:02,940
key point you know the infrastructure as

165
00:07:01,680 --> 00:07:04,680
code movement has really come up in the

166
00:07:02,940 --> 00:07:06,360
last two to three years and that's been

167
00:07:04,680 --> 00:07:08,430
the thing we're translating systems

168
00:07:06,360 --> 00:07:11,610
administration and operations guys to

169
00:07:08,430 --> 00:07:13,290
this DevOps dev engineering role that's

170
00:07:11,610 --> 00:07:14,610
the thing they don't necessarily know

171
00:07:13,290 --> 00:07:19,110
that so we had to get better integration

172
00:07:14,610 --> 00:07:22,710
better insight into how to code so how

173
00:07:19,110 --> 00:07:24,990
did we do it we started with a new group

174
00:07:22,710 --> 00:07:27,719
and get lab so this is basically if

175
00:07:24,990 --> 00:07:29,460
you've spent any time on github worked

176
00:07:27,720 --> 00:07:31,170
with git lab itself you can create a

177
00:07:29,460 --> 00:07:33,330
group that has specialized permissions

178
00:07:31,170 --> 00:07:35,280
and then grant everything to it it's

179
00:07:33,330 --> 00:07:38,219
initialized with the basic configuration

180
00:07:35,280 --> 00:07:41,070
for any environment has terraform files

181
00:07:38,220 --> 00:07:43,320
has basic wrapper cookbooks for our

182
00:07:41,070 --> 00:07:44,969
clients based on the commonalities that

183
00:07:43,320 --> 00:07:47,490
we found earlier in this process and

184
00:07:44,970 --> 00:07:48,630
then the entire environment is

185
00:07:47,490 --> 00:07:51,150
configured with the appropriate

186
00:07:48,630 --> 00:07:52,560
credentials which is for us we're still

187
00:07:51,150 --> 00:07:54,810
trying to wrap our brain around because

188
00:07:52,560 --> 00:07:57,720
these are not all of them but they are

189
00:07:54,810 --> 00:07:59,730
most of them so we have clients in all

190
00:07:57,720 --> 00:08:04,080
of these plus specialized bare metal

191
00:07:59,730 --> 00:08:12,390
areas we have one running an a s-300

192
00:08:04,080 --> 00:08:14,909
don't ask so oh I criticized my English

193
00:08:12,390 --> 00:08:17,490
for you guys we define our environment

194
00:08:14,910 --> 00:08:18,930
with terraform we create the

195
00:08:17,490 --> 00:08:20,280
infrastructure on the provider have you

196
00:08:18,930 --> 00:08:23,370
guys worked with terraform at all has

197
00:08:20,280 --> 00:08:24,750
anybody hands good you guys know what

198
00:08:23,370 --> 00:08:28,170
I'm talking about this actually allows

199
00:08:24,750 --> 00:08:29,580
us to create a repeatable environment we

200
00:08:28,170 --> 00:08:31,410
have a base infrastructure for

201
00:08:29,580 --> 00:08:33,179
everything that we do it's laid out with

202
00:08:31,410 --> 00:08:36,630
our required monitoring nodes are

203
00:08:33,179 --> 00:08:39,449
required proxies for access are required

204
00:08:36,630 --> 00:08:41,799
elq nodes and log staff proxies as well

205
00:08:39,450 --> 00:08:43,509
so

206
00:08:41,799 --> 00:08:45,998
we create this on the infrastructure

207
00:08:43,509 --> 00:08:48,369
provider and then we bootstrap it into

208
00:08:45,999 --> 00:08:49,509
chef 12 so we have a basic environment

209
00:08:48,369 --> 00:08:51,550
we've registered all the nodes we have

210
00:08:49,509 --> 00:08:53,619
direct access and then as soon as we do

211
00:08:51,550 --> 00:08:56,109
that we want to run it through a set of

212
00:08:53,619 --> 00:08:58,509
inspect tests so we know that our base

213
00:08:56,110 --> 00:09:00,279
environment is compliant with what our

214
00:08:58,509 --> 00:09:06,069
security standards have been set out to

215
00:09:00,279 --> 00:09:07,059
be from there then we actually layer on

216
00:09:06,069 --> 00:09:09,128
the other things that you would expect

217
00:09:07,059 --> 00:09:12,009
to get from any kind of configuration

218
00:09:09,129 --> 00:09:14,889
manager so we add on the specific type

219
00:09:12,009 --> 00:09:16,920
types of nodes we might necessarily grow

220
00:09:14,889 --> 00:09:20,290
the environment based on client demands

221
00:09:16,920 --> 00:09:22,809
we tie all of it into the appropriate

222
00:09:20,290 --> 00:09:26,860
monitoring and checks and then log

223
00:09:22,809 --> 00:09:28,329
everything so because we work in a cross

224
00:09:26,860 --> 00:09:30,759
environment where some of our private

225
00:09:28,329 --> 00:09:32,979
clients don't care and other clients

226
00:09:30,759 --> 00:09:35,529
have specific auditory regulate

227
00:09:32,980 --> 00:09:38,769
regulations that they read they need we

228
00:09:35,529 --> 00:09:40,600
also can pipe that out elsewhere this is

229
00:09:38,769 --> 00:09:44,529
our basic workflow it's just got

230
00:09:40,600 --> 00:09:48,069
pictures because I like pictures after

231
00:09:44,529 --> 00:09:50,139
the fact we have all of our instances

232
00:09:48,069 --> 00:09:52,209
registered for periodic scanning with

233
00:09:50,139 --> 00:09:54,639
our security team and we do quarterly

234
00:09:52,209 --> 00:09:56,649
red teaming which is not common anywhere

235
00:09:54,639 --> 00:09:58,360
that I've encountered but it's really

236
00:09:56,649 --> 00:09:59,860
important for us to understand where our

237
00:09:58,360 --> 00:10:01,240
environments are and we do that because

238
00:09:59,860 --> 00:10:03,819
we've gone through this entire process

239
00:10:01,240 --> 00:10:07,059
before we can clone a client environment

240
00:10:03,819 --> 00:10:08,740
in about two to three hours so we can go

241
00:10:07,059 --> 00:10:12,939
through a client environment and have it

242
00:10:08,740 --> 00:10:15,999
read teemed the same day with no impact

243
00:10:12,939 --> 00:10:17,649
that's the key part from a security

244
00:10:15,999 --> 00:10:18,399
standpoint all of our communications are

245
00:10:17,649 --> 00:10:21,399
locked down

246
00:10:18,399 --> 00:10:23,139
we have HTTP where any kind of HTTP is

247
00:10:21,399 --> 00:10:26,379
required if we need to set up a proxy to

248
00:10:23,139 --> 00:10:28,360
do that we do so ssh by default all

249
00:10:26,379 --> 00:10:30,850
accounts are limited basic best

250
00:10:28,360 --> 00:10:33,009
practices there's no password logins

251
00:10:30,850 --> 00:10:35,799
keys only that can be kind of a headache

252
00:10:33,009 --> 00:10:38,199
sometimes if somebody destroys their own

253
00:10:35,799 --> 00:10:41,019
machine no root logins anywhere ever

254
00:10:38,199 --> 00:10:43,359
period and ACLs are always defined to

255
00:10:41,019 --> 00:10:45,970
limit origin traffic to our sites and to

256
00:10:43,360 --> 00:10:48,309
the client sites we commonly have

257
00:10:45,970 --> 00:10:50,619
requests to add like one offs which we

258
00:10:48,309 --> 00:10:54,249
generally do not do or push back long

259
00:10:50,619 --> 00:10:55,660
enough for them to give up on we have a

260
00:10:54,249 --> 00:10:57,370
defined security policy

261
00:10:55,660 --> 00:10:59,230
and that's kind of key because whenever

262
00:10:57,370 --> 00:11:01,740
we onboard clients the clients are

263
00:10:59,230 --> 00:11:04,840
informed of what that security policy is

264
00:11:01,740 --> 00:11:06,880
that's really important because a lot of

265
00:11:04,840 --> 00:11:10,120
them don't like having a security policy

266
00:11:06,880 --> 00:11:12,730
that they have to abide by client

267
00:11:10,120 --> 00:11:14,890
exceptions do come up we will get to the

268
00:11:12,730 --> 00:11:16,870
point where it becomes CEO to CEO

269
00:11:14,890 --> 00:11:20,670
conversation and they say well we

270
00:11:16,870 --> 00:11:23,860
absolutely have to have this dumb thing

271
00:11:20,670 --> 00:11:26,979
okay we tell them that it's a dumb thing

272
00:11:23,860 --> 00:11:28,110
our security guys sign off on it and the

273
00:11:26,980 --> 00:11:30,280
client has to take ownership

274
00:11:28,110 --> 00:11:33,730
acknowledging that we told them they

275
00:11:30,280 --> 00:11:37,030
should not do that and then internally

276
00:11:33,730 --> 00:11:39,010
for our internal developers know our

277
00:11:37,030 --> 00:11:42,400
security team is fully capable and

278
00:11:39,010 --> 00:11:44,620
empowered to tell people no and we work

279
00:11:42,400 --> 00:11:48,310
with them hand-in-hand so they are

280
00:11:44,620 --> 00:11:49,810
partner they're not and an ally and we

281
00:11:48,310 --> 00:11:51,939
don't even have to fight that battle we

282
00:11:49,810 --> 00:11:53,560
say they want this security team goes

283
00:11:51,940 --> 00:11:55,420
and does it and then usually about three

284
00:11:53,560 --> 00:12:03,819
days later they came back and say okay

285
00:11:55,420 --> 00:12:05,380
done so again just to retouch on the

286
00:12:03,820 --> 00:12:08,110
minimum necessary access devs have

287
00:12:05,380 --> 00:12:09,700
access to development environments

288
00:12:08,110 --> 00:12:11,290
directly where they can change variables

289
00:12:09,700 --> 00:12:14,050
where they know they can note system

290
00:12:11,290 --> 00:12:16,540
changes that need to be made and there

291
00:12:14,050 --> 00:12:19,959
are no non-technical personnel in our

292
00:12:16,540 --> 00:12:22,870
environments business users really have

293
00:12:19,960 --> 00:12:25,750
no need to be on you know adjusting

294
00:12:22,870 --> 00:12:27,970
something like a I can't even think of

295
00:12:25,750 --> 00:12:30,280
memory parameter something like that

296
00:12:27,970 --> 00:12:31,750
it's when I came in there were PM's that

297
00:12:30,280 --> 00:12:34,470
had direct access to almost all of our

298
00:12:31,750 --> 00:12:36,790
client environments not necessary

299
00:12:34,470 --> 00:12:38,830
infrastructure changes are all handled

300
00:12:36,790 --> 00:12:41,410
through Jenkins through our own internal

301
00:12:38,830 --> 00:12:43,570
CI CD and code applications are deployed

302
00:12:41,410 --> 00:12:46,209
through either our internal dev teams or

303
00:12:43,570 --> 00:12:46,930
our clients CI tool if they don't know

304
00:12:46,210 --> 00:12:52,750
how to use it

305
00:12:46,930 --> 00:12:55,839
we help them do that so everything else

306
00:12:52,750 --> 00:12:57,040
we work off base images that are built

307
00:12:55,840 --> 00:12:59,500
to a hardening standard that was

308
00:12:57,040 --> 00:13:01,650
approved by our security team we have

309
00:12:59,500 --> 00:13:05,290
machines that are scanned for compliance

310
00:13:01,650 --> 00:13:06,970
along with along the build pipelines the

311
00:13:05,290 --> 00:13:09,370
communications all secured as mentioned

312
00:13:06,970 --> 00:13:10,870
earlier keys are encrypted with

313
00:13:09,370 --> 00:13:13,300
where it's stored separately thanks to

314
00:13:10,870 --> 00:13:17,320
the talk earlier about using pass

315
00:13:13,300 --> 00:13:19,569
because that's what we do and then data

316
00:13:17,320 --> 00:13:21,490
objects for our configuration management

317
00:13:19,570 --> 00:13:23,260
are all encrypted so for those of you

318
00:13:21,490 --> 00:13:26,640
familiar with chef you have data bags in

319
00:13:23,260 --> 00:13:26,640
there we encrypt all of our data bags

320
00:13:27,870 --> 00:13:33,550
when I'm usually talking out and about

321
00:13:30,130 --> 00:13:37,450
just amongst friends and amongst peers I

322
00:13:33,550 --> 00:13:38,949
get the Y not X a lot and there's a lot

323
00:13:37,450 --> 00:13:40,930
of different reasons for going through

324
00:13:38,950 --> 00:13:44,080
why we pick chef why we pick sensei why

325
00:13:40,930 --> 00:13:46,180
we picked whatever tool it was but they

326
00:13:44,080 --> 00:13:48,070
had the best internal support our team

327
00:13:46,180 --> 00:13:51,339
new chef already so taking that to the

328
00:13:48,070 --> 00:13:52,570
next level wasn't a hard move it's the

329
00:13:51,339 --> 00:13:54,100
most compatible with the other parts of

330
00:13:52,570 --> 00:13:56,380
the organization had the best trade-offs

331
00:13:54,100 --> 00:13:59,320
and was the best overall needs for our

332
00:13:56,380 --> 00:14:00,970
organization my caveat is always you

333
00:13:59,320 --> 00:14:02,740
should find out what works for you and

334
00:14:00,970 --> 00:14:06,310
run it I love salt

335
00:14:02,740 --> 00:14:13,170
I love ansible I'm if you on puppet well

336
00:14:06,310 --> 00:14:16,020
cfengine some of our continuing problems

337
00:14:13,170 --> 00:14:21,640
tend to be a lack of client buy-in

338
00:14:16,020 --> 00:14:23,560
they'll tell us no just no yeah it's a

339
00:14:21,640 --> 00:14:24,760
problem we have to educate them and

340
00:14:23,560 --> 00:14:26,319
that's one of the things that that you

341
00:14:24,760 --> 00:14:29,830
guys can go out and do with your peers

342
00:14:26,320 --> 00:14:31,860
or clients or other departments is just

343
00:14:29,830 --> 00:14:34,870
education is a lot of what's about there

344
00:14:31,860 --> 00:14:37,570
one of the things that we do is we use

345
00:14:34,870 --> 00:14:39,120
small words and big references so being

346
00:14:37,570 --> 00:14:45,400
from the States we say things like

347
00:14:39,120 --> 00:14:47,380
Target JP MC Yahoo people tend to

348
00:14:45,400 --> 00:14:49,209
recognize those as big issues but they

349
00:14:47,380 --> 00:14:52,240
come back with we don't have anything of

350
00:14:49,209 --> 00:14:53,949
value and they because we're working

351
00:14:52,240 --> 00:14:56,650
with marketing people they seem to

352
00:14:53,950 --> 00:14:59,220
instantly forget that they use user data

353
00:14:56,650 --> 00:15:01,360
and that's what people want so

354
00:14:59,220 --> 00:15:04,720
translating that into something that

355
00:15:01,360 --> 00:15:06,130
they can understand is much less of a

356
00:15:04,720 --> 00:15:10,150
hassle than it seems to be in other

357
00:15:06,130 --> 00:15:12,430
locations developer demands they tell us

358
00:15:10,150 --> 00:15:13,540
we're wrong all the time like we don't

359
00:15:12,430 --> 00:15:17,170
know what we're doing we haven't been

360
00:15:13,540 --> 00:15:20,260
doing it for 20 plus years it's fine

361
00:15:17,170 --> 00:15:21,729
I've been a developer I was very much at

362
00:15:20,260 --> 00:15:22,990
odds with the systems administrators

363
00:15:21,730 --> 00:15:24,850
that I dealt with I

364
00:15:22,990 --> 00:15:26,980
and it's finding those of those people

365
00:15:24,850 --> 00:15:29,410
who want to learn and educating them and

366
00:15:26,980 --> 00:15:30,820
then using them to educate their peers

367
00:15:29,410 --> 00:15:32,230
so that you're not trying to create a

368
00:15:30,820 --> 00:15:35,170
communication bloc you're trying to

369
00:15:32,230 --> 00:15:36,550
create a path this is our biggest

370
00:15:35,170 --> 00:15:39,790
problem and I think is one of the

371
00:15:36,550 --> 00:15:41,529
biggest problems in DevOps right now

372
00:15:39,790 --> 00:15:44,709
which is the monitoring and alerting and

373
00:15:41,529 --> 00:15:47,860
it's just noisy we have requests that

374
00:15:44,709 --> 00:15:50,020
come in that do all sorts of things but

375
00:15:47,860 --> 00:15:52,540
we our biggest issue is client

376
00:15:50,020 --> 00:15:54,910
monitoring so clients will ask us for

377
00:15:52,540 --> 00:15:57,099
specific monitors that go in and make

378
00:15:54,910 --> 00:15:59,100
sure that thing when things trigger we

379
00:15:57,100 --> 00:16:01,720
get alerted and we can address them our

380
00:15:59,100 --> 00:16:04,060
latest response to that is to make sure

381
00:16:01,720 --> 00:16:06,220
that there is client buy-in so if we get

382
00:16:04,060 --> 00:16:07,839
an alert then somebody at the client

383
00:16:06,220 --> 00:16:10,060
gets an alert at the same time so our

384
00:16:07,839 --> 00:16:12,100
pager duty when it rings the client

385
00:16:10,060 --> 00:16:14,500
knows it's ringing for us because it's

386
00:16:12,100 --> 00:16:18,580
ringing for them it tends to cut down a

387
00:16:14,500 --> 00:16:19,690
lot on the client driven noise it still

388
00:16:18,580 --> 00:16:22,360
hasn't really helped out with our own

389
00:16:19,690 --> 00:16:23,980
internal noise but you can't really do

390
00:16:22,360 --> 00:16:25,870
much about that except to trim down your

391
00:16:23,980 --> 00:16:26,620
alerts and tune them and then

392
00:16:25,870 --> 00:16:28,510
knowledge-sharing

393
00:16:26,620 --> 00:16:31,000
that's the biggest thing we do lunch and

394
00:16:28,510 --> 00:16:33,040
learns we do educational sessions we do

395
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:35,110
forums we do anything that we can to get

396
00:16:33,040 --> 00:16:36,640
our security group involved with the

397
00:16:35,110 --> 00:16:37,930
rest of the organization to make sure

398
00:16:36,640 --> 00:16:39,699
that we're involved with rest of our

399
00:16:37,930 --> 00:16:41,620
organization we invite our clients to

400
00:16:39,700 --> 00:16:43,149
come to these sessions so that they

401
00:16:41,620 --> 00:16:45,730
understand what we're doing to make sure

402
00:16:43,149 --> 00:16:47,440
that they're being treated like a

403
00:16:45,730 --> 00:16:49,690
first-class citizen all of the time

404
00:16:47,440 --> 00:16:51,940
because a lot of the issues that we deal

405
00:16:49,690 --> 00:16:54,959
with are we don't feel like we're

406
00:16:51,940 --> 00:16:54,959
getting the thing that we're paying for

407
00:16:55,050 --> 00:17:01,569
the future a better education more

408
00:16:59,290 --> 00:17:05,020
education we can only do so much right

409
00:17:01,570 --> 00:17:07,900
now so we're trying to do more reduction

410
00:17:05,020 --> 00:17:09,520
of noise by tuning our alerts better

411
00:17:07,900 --> 00:17:10,959
compliance and inspection and then just

412
00:17:09,520 --> 00:17:13,089
giving back taking the things that we've

413
00:17:10,959 --> 00:17:16,319
learned and sending people from our

414
00:17:13,089 --> 00:17:20,069
organization to go and talk about it so

415
00:17:16,319 --> 00:17:22,688
that's really all I've got for you guys

416
00:17:20,069 --> 00:17:25,079
but I'd be glad to take any questions if

417
00:17:22,689 --> 00:17:25,079
you have any

418
00:17:35,190 --> 00:17:38,580
all right thanks
