1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,410
for mr. pleasure to be a dub succumb as

2
00:00:03,480 --> 00:00:10,530
a sponsor us as a speaker so is it's me

3
00:00:07,410 --> 00:00:13,769
I'm just a software developer from

4
00:00:10,530 --> 00:00:16,470
internet security and this talk is not

5
00:00:13,769 --> 00:00:21,570
going to be about that Cyclops sector

6
00:00:16,470 --> 00:00:24,330
cops whatever ops ideas approaches tools

7
00:00:21,570 --> 00:00:26,130
into the supply delivery pipeline it's

8
00:00:24,330 --> 00:00:29,009
going to be about infrastructure

9
00:00:26,130 --> 00:00:31,769
infrastructure delivery infrastructure

10
00:00:29,010 --> 00:00:35,820
for us is mainly focuses on servers

11
00:00:31,769 --> 00:00:39,210
databases firewalls networks etc because

12
00:00:35,820 --> 00:00:44,129
just a reminder software runs on the top

13
00:00:39,210 --> 00:00:47,600
of an infrastructure so from the pops

14
00:00:44,129 --> 00:00:51,300
perspective a preliminary

15
00:00:47,600 --> 00:00:54,059
infrastructure-related that's words the

16
00:00:51,300 --> 00:00:56,190
good parts of of that is that an

17
00:00:54,059 --> 00:00:59,309
infrastructure could be a automatic

18
00:00:56,190 --> 00:01:01,500
delivery and permission it we have a lot

19
00:00:59,309 --> 00:01:04,640
of tools for making immutable way means

20
00:01:01,500 --> 00:01:08,070
of containers we can apply several

21
00:01:04,640 --> 00:01:12,299
roaches like for example from feet to

22
00:01:08,070 --> 00:01:14,479
cattles I'm something like and we can

23
00:01:12,299 --> 00:01:17,400
have a lot of kind of infrastructure

24
00:01:14,479 --> 00:01:19,860
like physical bit floor we can make a

25
00:01:17,400 --> 00:01:21,630
lot of combinations so it's very cool

26
00:01:19,860 --> 00:01:24,689
it's very cool from the most respected

27
00:01:21,630 --> 00:01:27,960
because we have a lot of tooling ok so

28
00:01:24,689 --> 00:01:30,179
the ugly part and not gets for libel

29
00:01:27,960 --> 00:01:33,270
perspective that's for wherever

30
00:01:30,180 --> 00:01:35,909
perspective really is that all are

31
00:01:33,270 --> 00:01:38,280
related with security okay security

32
00:01:35,909 --> 00:01:42,030
compliance is firewall in rabbits red

33
00:01:38,280 --> 00:01:45,210
container etc because it's complicated

34
00:01:42,030 --> 00:01:51,060
well will be a reason that is not a good

35
00:01:45,210 --> 00:01:54,869
reason so let's see why this is a brief

36
00:01:51,060 --> 00:01:57,149
description very brief about what is the

37
00:01:54,869 --> 00:01:58,770
application delivery pipeline we can

38
00:01:57,149 --> 00:02:01,140
separate on software delivery

39
00:01:58,770 --> 00:02:03,329
infrastructure delivery and we want to

40
00:02:01,140 --> 00:02:06,960
go to application to life to production

41
00:02:03,329 --> 00:02:08,910
as soon as possible so we can split

42
00:02:06,960 --> 00:02:11,910
infrastructure delivery on server

43
00:02:08,910 --> 00:02:13,250
container services and other related to

44
00:02:11,910 --> 00:02:16,760
the network info

45
00:02:13,250 --> 00:02:20,390
structure notes okay so let's see so

46
00:02:16,760 --> 00:02:22,040
we're delivery across somewhat believe

47
00:02:20,390 --> 00:02:24,380
it infrastructure network whatever

48
00:02:22,040 --> 00:02:27,079
application delivery it's mainly a

49
00:02:24,380 --> 00:02:29,810
complex process because involves a lot

50
00:02:27,080 --> 00:02:32,270
of people from different teams these

51
00:02:29,810 --> 00:02:34,520
teams are mainly silos with different

52
00:02:32,270 --> 00:02:37,370
culture with different way to the things

53
00:02:34,520 --> 00:02:39,709
so it's a very complex communication

54
00:02:37,370 --> 00:02:42,320
between them and it's always ruled by

55
00:02:39,709 --> 00:02:45,709
means of several ticketing systems or

56
00:02:42,320 --> 00:02:50,530
workflow system whatever okay so it's

57
00:02:45,709 --> 00:02:52,640
somewhat delivery when we want to make a

58
00:02:50,530 --> 00:02:55,760
butcher also we're company into the

59
00:02:52,640 --> 00:02:59,019
pipeline we have a lot of tools from the

60
00:02:55,760 --> 00:03:02,929
debuff repetitive we have tools for

61
00:02:59,020 --> 00:03:06,850
making a suit coat better as possible

62
00:03:02,930 --> 00:03:09,560
testing deploying etc monitoring and a

63
00:03:06,850 --> 00:03:11,780
few years ago with the appear of the

64
00:03:09,560 --> 00:03:15,050
depths a coughs movement exists a lot of

65
00:03:11,780 --> 00:03:16,790
tooling to for covering all the steps of

66
00:03:15,050 --> 00:03:20,590
the sower delivery for example you know

67
00:03:16,790 --> 00:03:23,929
BTD security applying for Jenkins or

68
00:03:20,590 --> 00:03:25,430
well for example center type with the

69
00:03:23,930 --> 00:03:28,100
nexus 5 wall for checking

70
00:03:25,430 --> 00:03:30,440
vulnerabilities on artifacts or whatever

71
00:03:28,100 --> 00:03:33,290
this is a lot of does you have good

72
00:03:30,440 --> 00:03:36,920
ideas good tools good approaches first

73
00:03:33,290 --> 00:03:39,260
of all I believe so okay it's fine what

74
00:03:36,920 --> 00:03:43,790
happened in the infrastructure and in

75
00:03:39,260 --> 00:03:47,600
the network delivery well here a devil

76
00:03:43,790 --> 00:03:49,760
came to rescue and every process that

77
00:03:47,600 --> 00:03:53,150
has to be x rated and reviewed by people

78
00:03:49,760 --> 00:03:54,260
now has to lean support more or less so

79
00:03:53,150 --> 00:03:56,390
we have for example configuration

80
00:03:54,260 --> 00:03:59,298
management tools like pop at chef and

81
00:03:56,390 --> 00:04:01,958
civil etc we can have containers for

82
00:03:59,299 --> 00:04:06,320
making new table infrastructures like

83
00:04:01,959 --> 00:04:10,820
darker cover net etc and a lot of a lot

84
00:04:06,320 --> 00:04:12,950
of okay so cool cool too well and what

85
00:04:10,820 --> 00:04:15,230
happen with the network well with the

86
00:04:12,950 --> 00:04:20,120
network is happening something similar

87
00:04:15,230 --> 00:04:22,729
because this is another movement that

88
00:04:20,120 --> 00:04:25,610
these girls from networks very couple

89
00:04:22,729 --> 00:04:26,990
two burners so network to code movements

90
00:04:25,610 --> 00:04:30,470
or assist a nettop

91
00:04:26,990 --> 00:04:32,690
movement that are providing solutions in

92
00:04:30,470 --> 00:04:34,789
the top of these devices in the top of

93
00:04:32,690 --> 00:04:37,219
the ad is that the devices providing

94
00:04:34,789 --> 00:04:40,068
slick for example the firewalls like a

95
00:04:37,220 --> 00:04:44,630
bender api's from unit / palo alto cisco

96
00:04:40,069 --> 00:04:47,569
arista etc or other scripting solutions

97
00:04:44,630 --> 00:04:50,060
or libraries like not nickel per amico

98
00:04:47,569 --> 00:04:52,340
or the combination of several tools like

99
00:04:50,060 --> 00:04:54,740
nape and provide some structural layer

100
00:04:52,340 --> 00:04:57,830
for pushing configuration on firewalls

101
00:04:54,740 --> 00:05:00,139
by means of fancy wall and of course

102
00:04:57,830 --> 00:05:03,409
with the appear of the sort of

103
00:05:00,139 --> 00:05:06,580
phenomenal working movement and the SDN

104
00:05:03,409 --> 00:05:09,919
controller it could be very easy to

105
00:05:06,580 --> 00:05:14,120
deliver the infrastructure but just

106
00:05:09,919 --> 00:05:16,789
deliver so what happened when we have to

107
00:05:14,120 --> 00:05:19,400
do the same thing that are we doing also

108
00:05:16,789 --> 00:05:21,710
a delivery when we have to do security

109
00:05:19,400 --> 00:05:24,349
validations about vulnerabilities or

110
00:05:21,710 --> 00:05:27,739
something like or compliances on the

111
00:05:24,349 --> 00:05:31,699
infrastructure delivery well it's quite

112
00:05:27,740 --> 00:05:36,610
difficult to find a solution to have

113
00:05:31,699 --> 00:05:42,169
support for this task in addition yes is

114
00:05:36,610 --> 00:05:45,650
this stage is more or less what has more

115
00:05:42,169 --> 00:05:48,049
bottleneck because it is mainly focusing

116
00:05:45,650 --> 00:05:50,659
on a process like this it's just an

117
00:05:48,050 --> 00:05:53,719
example could be vary depending of the

118
00:05:50,659 --> 00:05:55,250
company but more or less there exist

119
00:05:53,719 --> 00:05:58,300
several teams like application all

120
00:05:55,250 --> 00:06:02,270
nervous teens suck ups teens okay and

121
00:05:58,300 --> 00:06:05,500
the application owner make a request on

122
00:06:02,270 --> 00:06:08,799
to a workflow ticketing system like jada

123
00:06:05,500 --> 00:06:11,719
remedy or whatever say hey I want

124
00:06:08,800 --> 00:06:13,759
disability across this service and this

125
00:06:11,719 --> 00:06:17,150
and a little bit because i'm using on my

126
00:06:13,759 --> 00:06:20,090
application development so this is

127
00:06:17,150 --> 00:06:23,060
received by the risk assessment for the

128
00:06:20,090 --> 00:06:28,448
rest in saree and check the recesses man

129
00:06:23,060 --> 00:06:32,060
and say hmm maybe yes maybe no that this

130
00:06:28,449 --> 00:06:34,639
decision will take some days to take

131
00:06:32,060 --> 00:06:38,040
some hours and we are from the devil

132
00:06:34,639 --> 00:06:40,530
protected is it doesn't make sense so

133
00:06:38,040 --> 00:06:43,350
maybe this it could be approved it's a

134
00:06:40,530 --> 00:06:45,840
schedule it to make all the change in

135
00:06:43,350 --> 00:06:48,450
all the firewalls for example for the

136
00:06:45,840 --> 00:06:51,750
sick up steam and what happened we have

137
00:06:48,450 --> 00:06:54,630
a huge infrastructure with more than 100

138
00:06:51,750 --> 00:06:57,470
devices it's very difficult to apply

139
00:06:54,630 --> 00:07:00,270
changes in all of them and to analyze

140
00:06:57,470 --> 00:07:03,830
what will be involved in the change so

141
00:07:00,270 --> 00:07:07,070
this step could have more or less

142
00:07:03,830 --> 00:07:11,460
between weeks and months to be applied

143
00:07:07,070 --> 00:07:13,170
so and we when we do that the sack up

144
00:07:11,460 --> 00:07:17,219
steam delivered the change and you have

145
00:07:13,170 --> 00:07:20,700
to test that always okay what happened

146
00:07:17,220 --> 00:07:23,430
here there is a collateral damage here

147
00:07:20,700 --> 00:07:27,440
because you can test that your change

148
00:07:23,430 --> 00:07:30,180
okay but you could be dead making a

149
00:07:27,440 --> 00:07:33,120
degradation of your policy rules because

150
00:07:30,180 --> 00:07:36,900
you have don't things that make that

151
00:07:33,120 --> 00:07:38,700
your request could be work but maybe you

152
00:07:36,900 --> 00:07:42,030
are breaking breaking all the things

153
00:07:38,700 --> 00:07:45,690
okay so Rick's teams are periodically

154
00:07:42,030 --> 00:07:48,570
making policy cleanups operations to

155
00:07:45,690 --> 00:07:50,880
make that old google so this is really

156
00:07:48,570 --> 00:07:53,430
the bottlenecks it and dustin it doesn't

157
00:07:50,880 --> 00:07:58,650
make sense from the debug perspective so

158
00:07:53,430 --> 00:08:02,340
that and this we have no product yet for

159
00:07:58,650 --> 00:08:06,299
tooling these stations mix that they

160
00:08:02,340 --> 00:08:10,679
exist a real and painful bottleneck and

161
00:08:06,300 --> 00:08:15,180
infrastructure the river so recognition

162
00:08:10,680 --> 00:08:18,390
problems is a high manual process in

163
00:08:15,180 --> 00:08:22,410
both a lot of teams with different cool

164
00:08:18,390 --> 00:08:24,900
tools are silos you know devops finger

165
00:08:22,410 --> 00:08:28,710
or check ups the doctor know because i

166
00:08:24,900 --> 00:08:30,299
always say no to something and left with

167
00:08:28,710 --> 00:08:32,728
the problem is not an option because

168
00:08:30,300 --> 00:08:34,500
it's complicated security yeah it's

169
00:08:32,729 --> 00:08:36,990
complicated that it's not an option to

170
00:08:34,500 --> 00:08:39,450
life with that problems you cannot apply

171
00:08:36,990 --> 00:08:41,580
the security by optimist and prior

172
00:08:39,450 --> 00:08:47,280
approach you know hoping that nobody

173
00:08:41,580 --> 00:08:50,580
text you okay so what we want is a

174
00:08:47,280 --> 00:08:51,579
solution for that that increase our

175
00:08:50,580 --> 00:08:55,780
agility

176
00:08:51,580 --> 00:08:58,450
as fast as possible do a castle

177
00:08:55,780 --> 00:09:01,150
reduction because in the previous layer

178
00:08:58,450 --> 00:09:04,930
we see a process that is more or less

179
00:09:01,150 --> 00:09:08,110
for weeks to month and it's a very

180
00:09:04,930 --> 00:09:13,540
painful in cost and better risk controls

181
00:09:08,110 --> 00:09:16,900
okay we cannot live with the arch with

182
00:09:13,540 --> 00:09:19,000
the program as an option so okay that's

183
00:09:16,900 --> 00:09:22,000
a cup to the rescue why not to apply the

184
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:24,280
debt the same things the same ideas that

185
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:25,930
I applying on the store delivery on this

186
00:09:24,280 --> 00:09:32,199
infrastructure delivery in network

187
00:09:25,930 --> 00:09:35,380
delivery so in application delivery dub

188
00:09:32,200 --> 00:09:38,200
sack up say a apply the shift left

189
00:09:35,380 --> 00:09:42,250
paradigm this is test as soon as

190
00:09:38,200 --> 00:09:45,130
possible okay so okay if I have to test

191
00:09:42,250 --> 00:09:47,200
my network needs the first I have to do

192
00:09:45,130 --> 00:09:50,920
when I am the final application is to

193
00:09:47,200 --> 00:09:53,920
define my network needs and if I kill

194
00:09:50,920 --> 00:09:56,439
define an ascot that's better so sir

195
00:09:53,920 --> 00:09:58,479
cups same thing so they find your

196
00:09:56,440 --> 00:10:03,000
security rules are skilled and risk

197
00:09:58,480 --> 00:10:06,520
defined your compliance so when we say

198
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:07,930
network security rules compliance is the

199
00:10:06,520 --> 00:10:13,870
first word that comes to my mind is

200
00:10:07,930 --> 00:10:16,959
firewall policy okay whoa whoa not too

201
00:10:13,870 --> 00:10:19,600
fast are you talking to me that you are

202
00:10:16,960 --> 00:10:23,620
have to write firewall policies fellow

203
00:10:19,600 --> 00:10:27,360
policies are painful how do you make a

204
00:10:23,620 --> 00:10:31,330
lot of noise etc etc cetera okay so

205
00:10:27,360 --> 00:10:34,390
you're crazy no because you are thinking

206
00:10:31,330 --> 00:10:38,890
about how to write this fiber poises and

207
00:10:34,390 --> 00:10:42,430
I say write what you need I strapped all

208
00:10:38,890 --> 00:10:47,530
the things not say how to do that say

209
00:10:42,430 --> 00:10:49,089
what do you want so it's easy that any

210
00:10:47,530 --> 00:10:51,459
application owner could say something

211
00:10:49,090 --> 00:10:54,250
like I need to consume several servers

212
00:10:51,460 --> 00:10:57,340
and I need to provide several services

213
00:10:54,250 --> 00:11:01,930
across the network and here I have no

214
00:10:57,340 --> 00:11:03,779
idea which devices are involved holds my

215
00:11:01,930 --> 00:11:08,638
network and so on

216
00:11:03,779 --> 00:11:11,069
so from say cups you can say hey and if

217
00:11:08,639 --> 00:11:13,920
you are going to develop the liver sorry

218
00:11:11,069 --> 00:11:16,800
and application to the users user

219
00:11:13,920 --> 00:11:22,498
network has to see app servers okay

220
00:11:16,800 --> 00:11:25,079
simple so risk teams say okay bye all

221
00:11:22,499 --> 00:11:31,050
the traffic that goes across this has to

222
00:11:25,079 --> 00:11:33,839
be by tcp 443 or PCP 80 ok so right

223
00:11:31,050 --> 00:11:38,550
firewalls policies as code uses the

224
00:11:33,839 --> 00:11:42,660
proposal writing firewall policies skull

225
00:11:38,550 --> 00:11:44,579
give us a lot of good ideas if you apply

226
00:11:42,660 --> 00:11:47,339
the software-defined networking

227
00:11:44,579 --> 00:11:49,888
perspective because you can instruction

228
00:11:47,339 --> 00:11:54,269
you can have a lot of obstruction you

229
00:11:49,889 --> 00:11:58,019
think only what you want you don't have

230
00:11:54,269 --> 00:12:01,079
to think about vendors around ok I have

231
00:11:58,019 --> 00:12:04,529
48 cisco Palo Alto some of my

232
00:12:01,079 --> 00:12:07,229
infrastructure needs is in AWS don't

233
00:12:04,529 --> 00:12:08,879
think about that so be the clarity

234
00:12:07,230 --> 00:12:11,550
express your infrastructure security

235
00:12:08,879 --> 00:12:16,550
knees as user intense and write the

236
00:12:11,550 --> 00:12:19,859
fiber policies where you need be free so

237
00:12:16,550 --> 00:12:23,969
applying shift left is what depths are

238
00:12:19,860 --> 00:12:27,480
cops say ok what is the most left the

239
00:12:23,970 --> 00:12:28,889
application manifest when I refine in my

240
00:12:27,480 --> 00:12:33,750
application and the infrastructure than

241
00:12:28,889 --> 00:12:36,540
my application needs well it's fine it's

242
00:12:33,750 --> 00:12:39,389
good idea more or less i think that the

243
00:12:36,540 --> 00:12:41,490
second area but i need to support for

244
00:12:39,389 --> 00:12:45,990
this because you have no to support for

245
00:12:41,490 --> 00:12:47,670
this it's difficult to scale to reduce

246
00:12:45,990 --> 00:12:51,449
the bottleneck that we have seen before

247
00:12:47,670 --> 00:12:54,990
so for the best of my knowledge and and

248
00:12:51,449 --> 00:12:59,069
not here i think that in tournament

249
00:12:54,990 --> 00:13:01,949
could be a good solution so this is the

250
00:12:59,069 --> 00:13:04,050
pipeline propose the application owner

251
00:13:01,949 --> 00:13:07,109
defined application manifest and define

252
00:13:04,050 --> 00:13:10,589
what they provided what we want to

253
00:13:07,110 --> 00:13:13,379
consume the axis an entity like

254
00:13:10,589 --> 00:13:17,010
polishing join then consolidate what the

255
00:13:13,379 --> 00:13:20,670
wrist team says that is it's not testing

256
00:13:17,010 --> 00:13:25,170
not say okay you want this I going to

257
00:13:20,670 --> 00:13:27,959
test that no he said and this is the

258
00:13:25,170 --> 00:13:31,939
fins that are okay the sack up steam

259
00:13:27,960 --> 00:13:35,340
said at the CMDB what happened here and

260
00:13:31,940 --> 00:13:37,950
there is a prep low flow that pushed

261
00:13:35,340 --> 00:13:42,900
into the neck so let's see an example

262
00:13:37,950 --> 00:13:44,970
about this i'm going to use puppet for

263
00:13:42,900 --> 00:13:47,910
the find application manifest tap at DBS

264
00:13:44,970 --> 00:13:49,980
in DB and the rest of the team is going

265
00:13:47,910 --> 00:13:53,910
to be in tournament i'm going to push on

266
00:13:49,980 --> 00:13:57,420
these devices so with puppet with can

267
00:13:53,910 --> 00:13:58,770
define a scope or what they need we are

268
00:13:57,420 --> 00:14:02,459
going to validate the program visualize

269
00:13:58,770 --> 00:14:04,500
on it right well the puppet code that we

270
00:14:02,460 --> 00:14:07,950
are going to provide this an extension

271
00:14:04,500 --> 00:14:10,830
into the public definition that says

272
00:14:07,950 --> 00:14:14,450
what we have presently said of what we

273
00:14:10,830 --> 00:14:17,520
consume and we want to provide okay and

274
00:14:14,450 --> 00:14:19,860
it's all instruction as you can you can

275
00:14:17,520 --> 00:14:24,510
define IPS you can define profiles roles

276
00:14:19,860 --> 00:14:27,330
etc this is the example overview this is

277
00:14:24,510 --> 00:14:31,350
a huge network we are going to put an

278
00:14:27,330 --> 00:14:36,090
application of the bad that the front

279
00:14:31,350 --> 00:14:38,010
network sorry and all the things have to

280
00:14:36,090 --> 00:14:42,480
have communication with this these are

281
00:14:38,010 --> 00:14:44,910
all services this is what we want user

282
00:14:42,480 --> 00:14:47,760
needs https to the web server server

283
00:14:44,910 --> 00:14:51,390
need my school all servers use dns and

284
00:14:47,760 --> 00:14:55,080
sister mr. attorneys SSH okay here's

285
00:14:51,390 --> 00:14:57,420
what we need and here I don't have any

286
00:14:55,080 --> 00:15:00,530
idea what is behind this how many

287
00:14:57,420 --> 00:15:03,510
firewall i'm going to apply this and

288
00:15:00,530 --> 00:15:06,540
this is what the risks team said the

289
00:15:03,510 --> 00:15:09,030
reason said a ok but you have and have

290
00:15:06,540 --> 00:15:15,000
and keep that attitude to be flow okay

291
00:15:09,030 --> 00:15:17,370
you only have to have 443 so we define

292
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:19,650
in the application definition by means

293
00:15:17,370 --> 00:15:25,350
of profile where we provide will consume

294
00:15:19,650 --> 00:15:27,390
for each element like this example web

295
00:15:25,350 --> 00:15:29,670
server that provides web services under

296
00:15:27,390 --> 00:15:30,760
the bus services i find it there and

297
00:15:29,670 --> 00:15:34,270
using

298
00:15:30,760 --> 00:15:36,580
a parasternal area like my sources are

299
00:15:34,270 --> 00:15:40,420
internet and users I don't know where r

300
00:15:36,580 --> 00:15:44,820
I don't know the IP s nothing and I

301
00:15:40,420 --> 00:15:48,599
provide ssh and dns this other one tcp

302
00:15:44,820 --> 00:15:52,060
to to see that this application is

303
00:15:48,600 --> 00:15:54,520
providing a service by 80 and the

304
00:15:52,060 --> 00:15:58,810
distance say that this is not allow it

305
00:15:54,520 --> 00:16:01,470
okay so in this application we see an

306
00:15:58,810 --> 00:16:06,069
example from clarifying concepts about

307
00:16:01,470 --> 00:16:08,950
what is your money network the this

308
00:16:06,070 --> 00:16:10,990
sorry this one are the proposed flow

309
00:16:08,950 --> 00:16:15,160
defined by the wrist in that cannot be

310
00:16:10,990 --> 00:16:18,000
contradicted and here and say okay but I

311
00:16:15,160 --> 00:16:24,069
want to contribute something like here

312
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:27,400
so what happened it's an error and it is

313
00:16:24,070 --> 00:16:29,740
validated on a development stage in a

314
00:16:27,400 --> 00:16:33,100
software component it's not validated on

315
00:16:29,740 --> 00:16:37,470
production when there is the risk so

316
00:16:33,100 --> 00:16:40,900
this is not a little the listings has no

317
00:16:37,470 --> 00:16:46,240
ticket about that it's automatically

318
00:16:40,900 --> 00:16:48,370
validated and it's rejected application

319
00:16:46,240 --> 00:16:51,070
will now say and say okay I have to do

320
00:16:48,370 --> 00:16:57,400
only one simple change I have to move to

321
00:16:51,070 --> 00:17:00,340
443 and it is all ok so before we have

322
00:16:57,400 --> 00:17:02,590
this and now with this approach we have

323
00:17:00,340 --> 00:17:05,470
this my application woman i have defined

324
00:17:02,590 --> 00:17:08,100
the manifest the listing has all

325
00:17:05,470 --> 00:17:12,360
automated okay because it has the

326
00:17:08,099 --> 00:17:14,879
approved flows define it on a CMD be ok

327
00:17:12,359 --> 00:17:17,919
it's automatically a problem

328
00:17:14,880 --> 00:17:20,620
automatically validated and internment

329
00:17:17,920 --> 00:17:23,800
makes the automated change and the test

330
00:17:20,619 --> 00:17:25,569
ok so we go from something with

331
00:17:23,800 --> 00:17:31,480
bottlenecked so something that doesn't

332
00:17:25,569 --> 00:17:34,929
have bottleneck ok so in one minute i'm

333
00:17:31,480 --> 00:17:37,750
going to show you a brief demo or what

334
00:17:34,930 --> 00:17:40,690
we said this isn't element in telling me

335
00:17:37,750 --> 00:17:45,789
is just an application on the top

336
00:17:40,690 --> 00:17:49,600
of a controller but the finest over to

337
00:17:45,789 --> 00:17:55,200
find it networking solution so we have

338
00:17:49,600 --> 00:17:55,199
here an example Swan

339
00:18:05,230 --> 00:18:10,540
ok this is the huge topology that we

340
00:18:07,540 --> 00:18:13,600
have seen before and my security diagram

341
00:18:10,540 --> 00:18:17,678
I wait to filter for what I want I

342
00:18:13,600 --> 00:18:19,449
doesn't have to see all I only want to

343
00:18:17,679 --> 00:18:23,440
see what is related with my application

344
00:18:19,450 --> 00:18:25,450
and this is what we see ok and the red

345
00:18:23,440 --> 00:18:31,870
lines are the things that the bricks

346
00:18:25,450 --> 00:18:33,790
teams have denied so I got here but to

347
00:18:31,870 --> 00:18:43,659
be within my application manifest I

348
00:18:33,790 --> 00:18:46,120
choose the scenario tips at Tom and it

349
00:18:43,660 --> 00:18:49,150
is consolidating what is on the party be

350
00:18:46,120 --> 00:18:51,639
and what is on the scenario what is on

351
00:18:49,150 --> 00:18:55,270
the whole network ok in a declarative

352
00:18:51,640 --> 00:18:58,540
way it doesn't matter about any firewall

353
00:18:55,270 --> 00:19:02,290
in and gives me an example it could be

354
00:18:58,540 --> 00:19:04,600
automatic ok it it could be it's only

355
00:19:02,290 --> 00:19:14,730
just for qualifying and gas an example

356
00:19:04,600 --> 00:19:18,149
out of time and I finish I'm going to

357
00:19:14,730 --> 00:19:18,150
put this one

358
00:19:23,230 --> 00:19:27,270
oops here

359
00:19:29,649 --> 00:19:35,120
and it is automatically going into

360
00:19:32,389 --> 00:19:37,309
internment going to the CMDB and check

361
00:19:35,120 --> 00:19:47,000
in that it is consistent and have snow

362
00:19:37,309 --> 00:19:50,110
breaking the rules okay so let's see

363
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:50,110
what they say

364
00:19:56,160 --> 00:20:03,420
okay I get that for 43 and is our web so

365
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:08,670
I can't applied it okay and it has to be

366
00:20:03,420 --> 00:20:16,650
applied on their network so final

367
00:20:08,670 --> 00:20:18,930
remarks imposing controls is fine okay

368
00:20:16,650 --> 00:20:21,210
and using workflow ticketing system it's

369
00:20:18,930 --> 00:20:23,460
good but into this a lot of bottlenecks

370
00:20:21,210 --> 00:20:25,380
so from that perspective reduce your

371
00:20:23,460 --> 00:20:28,710
workflow bottlenecks so on as possible

372
00:20:25,380 --> 00:20:31,830
and work together to define what you

373
00:20:28,710 --> 00:20:35,400
need not thinking about how to do that

374
00:20:31,830 --> 00:20:37,379
and with good to spoil you can reduce

375
00:20:35,400 --> 00:20:40,620
your bottle neck into the network

376
00:20:37,380 --> 00:20:58,110
delivery so thank you so much for your

377
00:20:40,620 --> 00:21:00,659
attention if you have any questions no

378
00:20:58,110 --> 00:21:05,449
questions stop being really clear that

379
00:21:00,660 --> 00:21:05,450
well thank you very much thank you
