1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,950
okay guys so thanks very much for

2
00:00:02,129 --> 00:00:06,569
attending today so I'm taking like a

3
00:00:04,950 --> 00:00:09,710
maybe a slightly different route on this

4
00:00:06,569 --> 00:00:12,570
so this is mainly a talk around the

5
00:00:09,710 --> 00:00:15,150
potential uses and misuses of automation

6
00:00:12,570 --> 00:00:18,180
to potentially find security

7
00:00:15,150 --> 00:00:21,060
vulnerabilities and so i guess like just

8
00:00:18,180 --> 00:00:23,130
to quickly introduce myself so my name

9
00:00:21,060 --> 00:00:26,549
is Marcus Pinto I run a company called

10
00:00:23,130 --> 00:00:28,890
md sec he probably know if you know us

11
00:00:26,550 --> 00:00:30,150
at all that his as people who do a lot

12
00:00:28,890 --> 00:00:32,668
of training will get very excited about

13
00:00:30,150 --> 00:00:35,399
training a knowledge transfer so we

14
00:00:32,668 --> 00:00:37,468
wrote a book called the web application

15
00:00:35,399 --> 00:00:39,149
hacker's handbook and really what we've

16
00:00:37,469 --> 00:00:41,070
been trying to do all this time is to

17
00:00:39,149 --> 00:00:42,329
try and erode some of the security

18
00:00:41,070 --> 00:00:43,890
roadblocks that I'm sure would be

19
00:00:42,329 --> 00:00:46,620
hearing a lot about all the way through

20
00:00:43,890 --> 00:00:48,660
today but maybe erode them mainly

21
00:00:46,620 --> 00:00:50,640
through knowledge sharing so having done

22
00:00:48,660 --> 00:00:52,288
a lot of thinking really the only way i

23
00:00:50,640 --> 00:00:54,510
can think of to get rid of these

24
00:00:52,289 --> 00:00:57,090
roadblocks is to give the information to

25
00:00:54,510 --> 00:00:59,000
the people who are basically creating

26
00:00:57,090 --> 00:01:01,980
all these things in the first place and

27
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:03,960
with that obviously hope that they make

28
00:01:01,980 --> 00:01:07,350
fewer mistakes and find vulnerabilities

29
00:01:03,960 --> 00:01:09,720
faster and so i prefer to think of it as

30
00:01:07,350 --> 00:01:11,970
embedding security expertise rather than

31
00:01:09,720 --> 00:01:13,679
embedding and security experts because

32
00:01:11,970 --> 00:01:16,200
otherwise it's not a very scalable

33
00:01:13,680 --> 00:01:17,909
solution as we know so one of the

34
00:01:16,200 --> 00:01:19,979
biggest things that we tend to find is

35
00:01:17,909 --> 00:01:22,259
when we talk to people who may become

36
00:01:19,979 --> 00:01:25,020
more from a development sort of

37
00:01:22,259 --> 00:01:27,150
philosophy rather than say attack or

38
00:01:25,020 --> 00:01:29,610
hacking generally the biggest thing they

39
00:01:27,150 --> 00:01:31,020
say is I just don't think like that so I

40
00:01:29,610 --> 00:01:32,640
think that's fair enough I think I've

41
00:01:31,020 --> 00:01:34,710
probably guilty in the other direction I

42
00:01:32,640 --> 00:01:36,630
probably think overly too much about

43
00:01:34,710 --> 00:01:39,000
like you know hacking things and attack

44
00:01:36,630 --> 00:01:40,530
side of things so really this is also a

45
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:43,140
chance to kind of meld some of those

46
00:01:40,530 --> 00:01:44,369
confirmation biases okay so if you're

47
00:01:43,140 --> 00:01:46,020
not familiar with confirmation bias

48
00:01:44,369 --> 00:01:47,310
really it's just the fact that we always

49
00:01:46,020 --> 00:01:49,679
tend to look for things that we believe

50
00:01:47,310 --> 00:01:51,540
to be true so we want to believe that

51
00:01:49,680 --> 00:01:56,070
things we're and we're believing already

52
00:01:51,540 --> 00:01:57,630
are actually the case okay so I guessed

53
00:01:56,070 --> 00:02:01,320
hands up quickly if you're already

54
00:01:57,630 --> 00:02:02,610
automating to find security issues okay

55
00:02:01,320 --> 00:02:04,469
not too many i thought it would be

56
00:02:02,610 --> 00:02:06,360
nearly everyone but okay fair enough and

57
00:02:04,469 --> 00:02:08,369
so maybe some of these things look

58
00:02:06,360 --> 00:02:10,978
familiar so we've got these various

59
00:02:08,369 --> 00:02:13,980
Gartner and sort of given terms like and

60
00:02:10,979 --> 00:02:16,379
static assessment which generally refers

61
00:02:13,980 --> 00:02:18,750
two white box analysis so code review

62
00:02:16,379 --> 00:02:20,399
type tools we've got the more black box

63
00:02:18,750 --> 00:02:22,140
kind of dynamic tools we even got ones

64
00:02:20,400 --> 00:02:24,629
that interactively look at an

65
00:02:22,140 --> 00:02:26,760
application while it's running and then

66
00:02:24,629 --> 00:02:28,048
on the more kind of conventional

67
00:02:26,760 --> 00:02:29,609
infrastructure side maybe you're

68
00:02:28,049 --> 00:02:31,920
familiar with tools like Nessus and

69
00:02:29,610 --> 00:02:33,660
qualis and so on so you can often use

70
00:02:31,920 --> 00:02:35,970
those just to sort of throw against your

71
00:02:33,660 --> 00:02:37,109
servers over the network and they'll try

72
00:02:35,970 --> 00:02:39,120
to make loads of connections to

73
00:02:37,110 --> 00:02:40,620
different services essentially tell you

74
00:02:39,120 --> 00:02:42,239
all these sorts of funder abilities and

75
00:02:40,620 --> 00:02:43,860
and if you didn't think that was enough

76
00:02:42,239 --> 00:02:45,659
maybe you can give them credentials to

77
00:02:43,860 --> 00:02:48,599
your server and they can log on and they

78
00:02:45,659 --> 00:02:49,950
can find even more problems so I guess

79
00:02:48,599 --> 00:02:53,970
the question is for the people who put

80
00:02:49,950 --> 00:02:55,078
up their hands is it working ok how many

81
00:02:53,970 --> 00:02:58,290
people are going to put up the hand

82
00:02:55,079 --> 00:02:59,340
saying is it's working nobody is going

83
00:02:58,290 --> 00:03:02,040
to put up their hands and say it's

84
00:02:59,340 --> 00:03:04,250
working ok right so I guess this is a

85
00:03:02,040 --> 00:03:07,410
good conference to to start off in then

86
00:03:04,250 --> 00:03:08,430
ok so I think that is fair enough I

87
00:03:07,410 --> 00:03:09,930
think otherwise you might have guessed

88
00:03:08,430 --> 00:03:12,690
I'd probably ask you a few searching

89
00:03:09,930 --> 00:03:14,760
questions but if you did have a very

90
00:03:12,690 --> 00:03:15,959
very expensive tool let's say m you've

91
00:03:14,760 --> 00:03:18,149
gone to one of these vendors and their

92
00:03:15,959 --> 00:03:20,639
promise to solve world hunger by now

93
00:03:18,150 --> 00:03:23,220
buying this tool do you think you could

94
00:03:20,639 --> 00:03:26,790
think of a vulnerability that they're

95
00:03:23,220 --> 00:03:28,079
going to miss a type of vulnerability ok

96
00:03:26,790 --> 00:03:41,370
so what type of vulnerability could you

97
00:03:28,079 --> 00:03:43,079
potentially find yeah ok yep so maybe a

98
00:03:41,370 --> 00:03:45,900
token that wouldn't be recognizable as a

99
00:03:43,079 --> 00:03:53,000
token yeah well not as a security

100
00:03:45,900 --> 00:03:56,130
significant token hmm ok any others

101
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:57,389
business logic floors ok and so would

102
00:03:56,130 --> 00:03:58,680
say like pretty much everyone in the

103
00:03:57,389 --> 00:04:00,660
room could think of something and not

104
00:03:58,680 --> 00:04:02,489
only that like him I think pretty much

105
00:04:00,660 --> 00:04:04,500
any person that we know not this

106
00:04:02,489 --> 00:04:06,090
enlightened group but pretty much any

107
00:04:04,500 --> 00:04:07,739
person if they saw something like that

108
00:04:06,090 --> 00:04:10,079
and they'd know that something was up

109
00:04:07,739 --> 00:04:12,690
and it was potentially a problem with

110
00:04:10,079 --> 00:04:14,459
this you know this this application so

111
00:04:12,690 --> 00:04:16,649
clearly we shouldn't be able to execute

112
00:04:14,459 --> 00:04:19,019
this kind of stuff potentially like

113
00:04:16,649 --> 00:04:20,159
something bad might be happening ok but

114
00:04:19,019 --> 00:04:21,959
so if you think about those very

115
00:04:20,160 --> 00:04:23,610
expensive tools and they don't really

116
00:04:21,959 --> 00:04:25,229
understand applications as you say they

117
00:04:23,610 --> 00:04:26,700
don't understand business logic they

118
00:04:25,229 --> 00:04:27,349
don't really know what your application

119
00:04:26,700 --> 00:04:29,390
is

120
00:04:27,350 --> 00:04:31,250
application is just a series of buttons

121
00:04:29,390 --> 00:04:33,110
and forms that they need to click on and

122
00:04:31,250 --> 00:04:34,640
submit them they don't really know what

123
00:04:33,110 --> 00:04:36,440
the difference between say an ebay type

124
00:04:34,640 --> 00:04:38,300
application is from like you know

125
00:04:36,440 --> 00:04:42,770
facebook or your online bank or anything

126
00:04:38,300 --> 00:04:44,270
else okay so we probably want to check

127
00:04:42,770 --> 00:04:48,080
up on our automation just to make sure

128
00:04:44,270 --> 00:04:50,359
it's doing a reasonable job so basically

129
00:04:48,080 --> 00:04:51,979
like you probably got some of these

130
00:04:50,360 --> 00:04:54,980
things which are maybe being automated

131
00:04:51,980 --> 00:04:56,540
so we've got black box scanning tools

132
00:04:54,980 --> 00:04:58,610
which these sort of you know daft tools

133
00:04:56,540 --> 00:05:01,070
I was talking about and we've got some

134
00:04:58,610 --> 00:05:03,680
ability to maybe run automated tools to

135
00:05:01,070 --> 00:05:04,909
find bugs in code and what you really

136
00:05:03,680 --> 00:05:06,800
want to know is they are they actually

137
00:05:04,910 --> 00:05:08,390
working and and more to the point since

138
00:05:06,800 --> 00:05:09,980
we know they're probably not working how

139
00:05:08,390 --> 00:05:11,450
we're going to check up on them okay

140
00:05:09,980 --> 00:05:13,430
what what checks are we going to have to

141
00:05:11,450 --> 00:05:14,740
make sure if we just rely on the

142
00:05:13,430 --> 00:05:17,570
information coming out the tool itself

143
00:05:14,740 --> 00:05:19,940
you know that's obviously not very not

144
00:05:17,570 --> 00:05:21,830
very useful and so we do have ways of

145
00:05:19,940 --> 00:05:23,540
doing this I think it was briefly

146
00:05:21,830 --> 00:05:25,130
mentioned last talked we now have these

147
00:05:23,540 --> 00:05:26,630
things like bug bounties and

148
00:05:25,130 --> 00:05:28,790
particularly like red teaming for

149
00:05:26,630 --> 00:05:30,110
infrastructures and so red teaming was

150
00:05:28,790 --> 00:05:33,230
obviously born out of the fact that

151
00:05:30,110 --> 00:05:34,910
people kind of know that that their

152
00:05:33,230 --> 00:05:36,200
infrastructure scanning tools even

153
00:05:34,910 --> 00:05:37,850
though they're finding all these bugs

154
00:05:36,200 --> 00:05:40,490
they're not actually finding the bugs

155
00:05:37,850 --> 00:05:42,320
that necessarily matter as somebody said

156
00:05:40,490 --> 00:05:44,240
like false positives as a service so

157
00:05:42,320 --> 00:05:45,620
really a lot of these tools are and so

158
00:05:44,240 --> 00:05:47,090
what we really want to know is like how

159
00:05:45,620 --> 00:05:49,580
would a real hacker potentially attack

160
00:05:47,090 --> 00:05:50,900
us and and real hackers don't exploit

161
00:05:49,580 --> 00:05:53,060
the sort of vulnerabilities in the way

162
00:05:50,900 --> 00:05:55,340
that they're presented in these these

163
00:05:53,060 --> 00:05:56,990
automated tools real attackers follow

164
00:05:55,340 --> 00:05:59,060
hunches and they chained together

165
00:05:56,990 --> 00:06:00,740
different facts they follow trust

166
00:05:59,060 --> 00:06:02,870
relationships and that they're very very

167
00:06:00,740 --> 00:06:04,400
different beasts to you know people they

168
00:06:02,870 --> 00:06:06,020
don't start off running Nessus and go

169
00:06:04,400 --> 00:06:06,979
right I'm going to do that and I'm

170
00:06:06,020 --> 00:06:10,099
probably going to try that if that

171
00:06:06,980 --> 00:06:11,570
doesn't work then that one okay so also

172
00:06:10,100 --> 00:06:13,370
with the application side of things

173
00:06:11,570 --> 00:06:15,140
again we have maybe a slightly different

174
00:06:13,370 --> 00:06:17,300
way of thinking that comes out of people

175
00:06:15,140 --> 00:06:19,310
who are having a go at bug bounties and

176
00:06:17,300 --> 00:06:21,800
bug bounties in a way or an admission

177
00:06:19,310 --> 00:06:23,690
that we won't get everything right we

178
00:06:21,800 --> 00:06:25,430
need to have some sort of check and

179
00:06:23,690 --> 00:06:29,750
balance even beyond everything else we

180
00:06:25,430 --> 00:06:31,220
might have and so if you were to look at

181
00:06:29,750 --> 00:06:33,710
rounds up maybe all the vulnerabilities

182
00:06:31,220 --> 00:06:36,080
you could think of and put them into two

183
00:06:33,710 --> 00:06:38,090
categories and you maybe would come up

184
00:06:36,080 --> 00:06:39,650
with these kinds of categories okay so

185
00:06:38,090 --> 00:06:40,638
there may be other ways of splitting

186
00:06:39,650 --> 00:06:43,280
them but

187
00:06:40,639 --> 00:06:46,099
this is one of the most helpful okay so

188
00:06:43,280 --> 00:06:48,438
we could think of design flaws and so

189
00:06:46,099 --> 00:06:50,479
things you mentioned like you know some

190
00:06:48,439 --> 00:06:52,029
tokens that you know could be used to

191
00:06:50,479 --> 00:06:54,318
completely compromise the infrastructure

192
00:06:52,029 --> 00:06:55,310
some encryption keys sitting right next

193
00:06:54,319 --> 00:06:58,219
to the data it's supposed to be

194
00:06:55,310 --> 00:06:59,870
protecting some no critical step of a

195
00:06:58,219 --> 00:07:02,479
workflow you could just skip over like

196
00:06:59,870 --> 00:07:04,430
paying for stuff and any of those kinds

197
00:07:02,479 --> 00:07:07,400
of issues are very much rooted in more

198
00:07:04,430 --> 00:07:09,379
kind of application design rather than

199
00:07:07,400 --> 00:07:11,659
night care any sort of coding or

200
00:07:09,379 --> 00:07:13,279
technology related issue and so on the

201
00:07:11,659 --> 00:07:14,960
other side obviously you have maybe the

202
00:07:13,279 --> 00:07:16,599
old favorites that you know you probably

203
00:07:14,960 --> 00:07:18,770
see trotted out all over the internet so

204
00:07:16,599 --> 00:07:20,900
things like secret injection cross-site

205
00:07:18,770 --> 00:07:23,000
scripting so on so forth okay so and

206
00:07:20,900 --> 00:07:25,878
those are maybe more kind of I care you

207
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:28,520
know code baited based flaws and it's

208
00:07:25,879 --> 00:07:29,870
been our experience and possibly some

209
00:07:28,520 --> 00:07:31,789
other people's experience as well but

210
00:07:29,870 --> 00:07:33,349
and we tend to find that the split is

211
00:07:31,789 --> 00:07:35,719
about fifty five percent of the

212
00:07:33,349 --> 00:07:39,289
vulnerabilities tend to be design flaws

213
00:07:35,719 --> 00:07:42,259
and about sixty percent tend to be Co

214
00:07:39,289 --> 00:07:44,599
floors okay so that was part of

215
00:07:42,259 --> 00:07:46,250
confirmation bias number one so yes you

216
00:07:44,599 --> 00:07:48,830
are allowed to have over a hundred

217
00:07:46,250 --> 00:07:51,560
percent in that and so obviously some

218
00:07:48,830 --> 00:07:53,000
fall into both categories okay so the

219
00:07:51,560 --> 00:07:54,979
real problem then is like some of these

220
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:58,279
are going to be potentially very easy to

221
00:07:54,979 --> 00:08:00,710
you know automate and find bugs for no

222
00:07:58,279 --> 00:08:02,029
and without too much configuration some

223
00:08:00,710 --> 00:08:03,799
of these are going to be very hard and

224
00:08:02,029 --> 00:08:07,240
obviously no prizes for forgetting which

225
00:08:03,800 --> 00:08:10,639
category where we're struggling with

226
00:08:07,240 --> 00:08:12,649
okay so what we did like md sec ever I

227
00:08:10,639 --> 00:08:15,949
think about we've got about 400

228
00:08:12,649 --> 00:08:17,419
different lab exercises online and what

229
00:08:15,949 --> 00:08:19,370
we did is before the vendors got any

230
00:08:17,419 --> 00:08:21,049
chance to see our lab exercises and we

231
00:08:19,370 --> 00:08:23,000
basically got got hold of all the evil

232
00:08:21,050 --> 00:08:25,430
versions of the automated tools out

233
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:28,129
there and ran them against our our demo

234
00:08:25,430 --> 00:08:29,839
labs and obviously then like took a

235
00:08:28,129 --> 00:08:33,229
break down to see like you know how many

236
00:08:29,839 --> 00:08:35,179
found what bugs um and some of these

237
00:08:33,229 --> 00:08:37,370
numbers need a bit of explaining so it

238
00:08:35,179 --> 00:08:39,019
looks worse than it is so when we say

239
00:08:37,370 --> 00:08:40,669
they found forty-three percent of the

240
00:08:39,019 --> 00:08:42,289
cross-site scripting bugs what that

241
00:08:40,669 --> 00:08:43,789
means is some of the cross-site

242
00:08:42,289 --> 00:08:46,160
scripting bugs were actually very hard

243
00:08:43,789 --> 00:08:49,430
to find so they may be found a large

244
00:08:46,160 --> 00:08:51,410
number of the easy to find bugs so it's

245
00:08:49,430 --> 00:08:53,329
still like maybe a slightly better story

246
00:08:51,410 --> 00:08:54,420
than it might look and but some of those

247
00:08:53,329 --> 00:08:56,849
numbers are maybe sort

248
00:08:54,420 --> 00:08:58,199
worryingly low I guess that they're very

249
00:08:56,850 --> 00:09:00,690
low ones they're some of the

250
00:08:58,200 --> 00:09:03,209
zero-percent and again maybe that's not

251
00:09:00,690 --> 00:09:04,889
too surprising so these tools didn't

252
00:09:03,209 --> 00:09:06,689
have a chance to configure themselves to

253
00:09:04,889 --> 00:09:08,370
find our bugs but they didn't know what

254
00:09:06,690 --> 00:09:14,220
the access rules were so how can they

255
00:09:08,370 --> 00:09:15,750
find an access control bug okay so yeah

256
00:09:14,220 --> 00:09:17,339
probably my favorite quotes I'm not sure

257
00:09:15,750 --> 00:09:19,410
I'm allowed to name him but Sir yeah I

258
00:09:17,339 --> 00:09:21,870
quite like that one so if we're going to

259
00:09:19,410 --> 00:09:23,430
look at automation then we need to

260
00:09:21,870 --> 00:09:26,370
decide like what types of floors there

261
00:09:23,430 --> 00:09:27,930
are and how we're going to how we going

262
00:09:26,370 --> 00:09:31,230
to solve a remedy those or at least

263
00:09:27,930 --> 00:09:33,329
either find the more or not make them ok

264
00:09:31,230 --> 00:09:36,060
so for design flaws and we probably

265
00:09:33,329 --> 00:09:38,189
needs a lot of custom checks because the

266
00:09:36,060 --> 00:09:39,869
tools need to be application-aware they

267
00:09:38,190 --> 00:09:41,730
need to understand our specifics in

268
00:09:39,870 --> 00:09:43,920
order to even know what they what the

269
00:09:41,730 --> 00:09:45,510
rules are with code floors we have a

270
00:09:43,920 --> 00:09:47,160
much easier problem really and there

271
00:09:45,510 --> 00:09:49,350
could be very standard syntax just to

272
00:09:47,160 --> 00:09:51,000
say you know we understand that if you

273
00:09:49,350 --> 00:09:53,160
send this malformed string at the server

274
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:55,820
and you get back any one of these like

275
00:09:53,160 --> 00:09:58,769
piece of syntax something's gone wrong

276
00:09:55,820 --> 00:10:00,089
ok so the other problem then these are

277
00:09:58,769 --> 00:10:02,839
often written by like you know the

278
00:10:00,089 --> 00:10:05,220
supposedly brilliant independent experts

279
00:10:02,839 --> 00:10:06,810
they spend all their time doing this so

280
00:10:05,220 --> 00:10:08,250
you know at least you hope that these

281
00:10:06,810 --> 00:10:10,250
are the experts and they know they

282
00:10:08,250 --> 00:10:12,420
really giving you everything they can

283
00:10:10,250 --> 00:10:14,040
maybe the problem with a custom checks

284
00:10:12,420 --> 00:10:15,689
certainly from my experience is that

285
00:10:14,040 --> 00:10:18,180
they tend to be written by those in

286
00:10:15,690 --> 00:10:19,260
charge of writing the floors ok so i

287
00:10:18,180 --> 00:10:21,180
don't know if that's everyone else's

288
00:10:19,260 --> 00:10:23,579
experience but obviously you can have

289
00:10:21,180 --> 00:10:26,310
things like unit testing you can't have

290
00:10:23,579 --> 00:10:27,959
like custom tests within with your

291
00:10:26,310 --> 00:10:31,170
environment i think like if you've seen

292
00:10:27,959 --> 00:10:33,329
Stephen de freitas talk on BDD security

293
00:10:31,170 --> 00:10:35,160
and so that was done last year and I

294
00:10:33,329 --> 00:10:36,689
think does its or every few years he

295
00:10:35,160 --> 00:10:39,269
comes out hiding and delivers it but

296
00:10:36,690 --> 00:10:40,800
it's a very good talk it kind of helps

297
00:10:39,269 --> 00:10:42,899
solve these kinds of problems i think

298
00:10:40,800 --> 00:10:44,819
the custom design flaws and but by and

299
00:10:42,899 --> 00:10:47,399
large a lot of the problems are that the

300
00:10:44,819 --> 00:10:49,439
people who need to write the checks are

301
00:10:47,399 --> 00:10:51,480
also writing the flaws and all the sorts

302
00:10:49,440 --> 00:10:52,980
of people and so that's the problem that

303
00:10:51,480 --> 00:10:56,579
I'd really like to sort of try and help

304
00:10:52,980 --> 00:10:58,500
solve okay so quick disclaimer on

305
00:10:56,579 --> 00:11:00,420
automation so I think everyone's going

306
00:10:58,500 --> 00:11:02,130
to say the same thing but i think i'm

307
00:11:00,420 --> 00:11:04,439
talking about today's automation and

308
00:11:02,130 --> 00:11:06,420
today's solutions so maybe some Oreos

309
00:11:04,440 --> 00:11:08,190
will be vastly different I fully expect

310
00:11:06,420 --> 00:11:11,069
my job to be automated pretty much

311
00:11:08,190 --> 00:11:13,800
entirely and sort of 10 to 15 years time

312
00:11:11,070 --> 00:11:16,020
so you know I think like care the

313
00:11:13,800 --> 00:11:17,250
current tools have limited coverage and

314
00:11:16,020 --> 00:11:19,470
there are actually very very simple

315
00:11:17,250 --> 00:11:21,030
tools like even though they purport to

316
00:11:19,470 --> 00:11:22,890
solve world hunger there often just

317
00:11:21,030 --> 00:11:25,290
looking for a single bit of syntax or

318
00:11:22,890 --> 00:11:27,569
maybe a bank of sin taxes they just die

319
00:11:25,290 --> 00:11:30,120
often just operating on their reg exes

320
00:11:27,570 --> 00:11:32,040
so if you don't believe me have a run

321
00:11:30,120 --> 00:11:33,330
through like fire them up against some

322
00:11:32,040 --> 00:11:35,910
code and see what they come back with

323
00:11:33,330 --> 00:11:37,560
and so that I mean it's not a it's not

324
00:11:35,910 --> 00:11:39,209
floor in the tools themselves it's just

325
00:11:37,560 --> 00:11:41,209
a limitation of where we are in terms of

326
00:11:39,210 --> 00:11:43,830
automation but I'm sure that will change

327
00:11:41,210 --> 00:11:45,540
so yeah I'm stressing not just for this

328
00:11:43,830 --> 00:11:46,950
audience but also the future AI who's

329
00:11:45,540 --> 00:11:48,990
going to be obviously watching this

330
00:11:46,950 --> 00:11:50,610
televised thing I was very much on your

331
00:11:48,990 --> 00:11:56,160
side and I definitely agreed that you

332
00:11:50,610 --> 00:11:58,140
would exist okay so em back to the

333
00:11:56,160 --> 00:12:00,120
confirmation bias problem then so if we

334
00:11:58,140 --> 00:12:01,590
could solve confirmation bias maybe we

335
00:12:00,120 --> 00:12:03,660
can solve a lot of these design flaws

336
00:12:01,590 --> 00:12:05,760
and which are basically being checked up

337
00:12:03,660 --> 00:12:08,160
on by the people writing there and you

338
00:12:05,760 --> 00:12:09,720
know right in the floors so the problem

339
00:12:08,160 --> 00:12:11,459
obviously is that if you want something

340
00:12:09,720 --> 00:12:12,990
to be secure then you'll tend to look

341
00:12:11,460 --> 00:12:14,820
for evidence that it is secure and

342
00:12:12,990 --> 00:12:17,100
that's human nature and obviously the

343
00:12:14,820 --> 00:12:18,240
converse is also true and so maybe if

344
00:12:17,100 --> 00:12:20,310
you think about these sorts of people

345
00:12:18,240 --> 00:12:21,780
like you know maybe they started off

346
00:12:20,310 --> 00:12:24,959
with some different expectations about

347
00:12:21,780 --> 00:12:26,819
how how things would work and if you

348
00:12:24,960 --> 00:12:29,400
recognize that last one obviously like

349
00:12:26,820 --> 00:12:30,780
that's the the very obvious sort of case

350
00:12:29,400 --> 00:12:33,030
of obscurity you know potentially

351
00:12:30,780 --> 00:12:35,699
looking like a good thing up until the

352
00:12:33,030 --> 00:12:37,020
point it wasn't and suddenly you know

353
00:12:35,700 --> 00:12:39,090
people like me to start doing things

354
00:12:37,020 --> 00:12:40,710
like this and I printing out tsa keys

355
00:12:39,090 --> 00:12:42,270
and good luck patching all your

356
00:12:40,710 --> 00:12:44,070
suitcases because there's probably a lot

357
00:12:42,270 --> 00:12:45,810
of them out there now and so really

358
00:12:44,070 --> 00:12:47,760
those sorts of problems can't be solved

359
00:12:45,810 --> 00:12:51,869
by rigorous testing after you've already

360
00:12:47,760 --> 00:12:53,910
created the the problem okay so one want

361
00:12:51,870 --> 00:12:55,350
to do just for the the rest of the time

362
00:12:53,910 --> 00:12:57,300
really is just run through like chem

363
00:12:55,350 --> 00:12:59,970
some of the interesting bugs I think

364
00:12:57,300 --> 00:13:01,469
potentially show maybe some of the

365
00:12:59,970 --> 00:13:04,020
critical thinking and some of the like

366
00:13:01,470 --> 00:13:06,420
kind of ingenious necessary which

367
00:13:04,020 --> 00:13:08,460
hopefully you can take on to potentially

368
00:13:06,420 --> 00:13:10,229
like a challenge applications and before

369
00:13:08,460 --> 00:13:11,640
they've even been written so I wouldn't

370
00:13:10,230 --> 00:13:12,870
say when before the first line of code

371
00:13:11,640 --> 00:13:15,839
has been written but even when the idea

372
00:13:12,870 --> 00:13:17,250
has been sort of created so the guy came

373
00:13:15,839 --> 00:13:18,690
up with the idea of like care you know

374
00:13:17,250 --> 00:13:20,910
creating some keys that works on all

375
00:13:18,690 --> 00:13:22,089
suitcases that was the time to talk to

376
00:13:20,910 --> 00:13:22,959
him and say by the way

377
00:13:22,089 --> 00:13:26,319
you know what's going to happen don't

378
00:13:22,959 --> 00:13:27,579
you okay so you'll probably think that

379
00:13:26,319 --> 00:13:29,110
most of this actually looks quite easy

380
00:13:27,579 --> 00:13:31,899
and that's actually kind of the point of

381
00:13:29,110 --> 00:13:34,269
the talk as well so I my parents want to

382
00:13:31,899 --> 00:13:35,889
ask me like chem to explain what I did

383
00:13:34,269 --> 00:13:38,110
as a living I'm sure your parents are

384
00:13:35,889 --> 00:13:39,759
done the same and I thought well okay

385
00:13:38,110 --> 00:13:41,350
I'll explain sequel injection because

386
00:13:39,759 --> 00:13:43,660
that's easy so explain sequel injection

387
00:13:41,350 --> 00:13:46,209
my mom looked at me and said is that all

388
00:13:43,660 --> 00:13:49,059
you do that's really easy and I thought

389
00:13:46,209 --> 00:13:51,459
well yeah it is it is so let's let's

390
00:13:49,059 --> 00:13:52,480
admit it it is very easy and some of

391
00:13:51,459 --> 00:13:55,089
these things particularly after they

392
00:13:52,480 --> 00:13:57,040
described actually are so so let's all

393
00:13:55,089 --> 00:13:58,180
like let's all find these bugs and

394
00:13:57,040 --> 00:13:59,740
because yeah they're not they're not

395
00:13:58,180 --> 00:14:03,910
sort of mystical things rabbit out the

396
00:13:59,740 --> 00:14:05,769
Hat type stuff okay so a quick sort of

397
00:14:03,910 --> 00:14:07,209
idea of you know this sort of thinking

398
00:14:05,769 --> 00:14:09,939
and so let's say you're trying to break

399
00:14:07,209 --> 00:14:13,748
into our hotel room and how would you go

400
00:14:09,939 --> 00:14:16,180
about it so some ideas so you want to

401
00:14:13,749 --> 00:14:18,189
break in someone's hotel room lost your

402
00:14:16,180 --> 00:14:19,329
key cards so try and get another key

403
00:14:18,189 --> 00:14:29,259
presumably where would you get a key

404
00:14:19,329 --> 00:14:31,479
from okay any other ideas is that one of

405
00:14:29,259 --> 00:14:34,300
the table and don't know I think that's

406
00:14:31,480 --> 00:14:35,889
just an ashtray and to be honest could

407
00:14:34,300 --> 00:14:39,550
be though you have a look around see if

408
00:14:35,889 --> 00:14:45,790
there's some lying around then clone a

409
00:14:39,550 --> 00:14:50,079
key room cleaners okay any others let's

410
00:14:45,790 --> 00:14:54,429
go fer back here mugs a person okay fair

411
00:14:50,079 --> 00:14:57,638
enough kill him okay um I gotta stop now

412
00:14:54,429 --> 00:15:06,699
no more no more suggestion I'm on camera

413
00:14:57,639 --> 00:15:11,610
oh go on oh yeah okay bribery yeah again

414
00:15:06,699 --> 00:15:11,609
yeah go on

415
00:15:12,040 --> 00:15:16,019
yep at the back I think another one

416
00:15:17,070 --> 00:15:22,839
sorry so go for alarm okay yeah so it's

417
00:15:21,579 --> 00:15:24,219
interesting though like see how many

418
00:15:22,839 --> 00:15:26,050
different ideas are are and that the

419
00:15:24,220 --> 00:15:27,459
longer you think about it you start to

420
00:15:26,050 --> 00:15:29,709
have to get a little bit creative don't

421
00:15:27,459 --> 00:15:32,920
you possibly destructive in some cases

422
00:15:29,709 --> 00:15:34,149
like mugging or killing or so on but

423
00:15:32,920 --> 00:15:35,889
yeah I mean like most people come up

424
00:15:34,149 --> 00:15:38,009
with you know the same initial ones like

425
00:15:35,889 --> 00:15:40,480
get a key printed by the receptionist

426
00:15:38,009 --> 00:15:42,279
and nice piece of confirmation bias

427
00:15:40,480 --> 00:15:43,990
there I had a picture of reception so

428
00:15:42,279 --> 00:15:45,790
you're always going to say that wait for

429
00:15:43,990 --> 00:15:47,079
the room to be cleaned yes so we can

430
00:15:45,790 --> 00:15:49,689
think about other things that happen in

431
00:15:47,079 --> 00:15:51,189
the room a hammer or you know killing or

432
00:15:49,690 --> 00:15:53,740
mugging if that's more appropriate for

433
00:15:51,190 --> 00:15:56,199
you so all of those are potential ways

434
00:15:53,740 --> 00:15:57,699
of getting into the room but the nice

435
00:15:56,199 --> 00:15:59,859
way it would be nice if we had a way of

436
00:15:57,699 --> 00:16:01,240
just sort of finding all these problems

437
00:15:59,860 --> 00:16:03,069
by brainstorming we didn't have to

438
00:16:01,240 --> 00:16:04,540
invite a room full of 200 people every

439
00:16:03,069 --> 00:16:06,819
time we wanted to you know try and find

440
00:16:04,540 --> 00:16:09,579
a way in and so what we need to do

441
00:16:06,819 --> 00:16:11,290
really is try to think about some

442
00:16:09,579 --> 00:16:13,359
different ways maybe initially by

443
00:16:11,290 --> 00:16:15,310
brainstorming so and we maybe come up

444
00:16:13,360 --> 00:16:17,050
with getting access to the machine the

445
00:16:15,310 --> 00:16:18,609
receptionist used to print keys so

446
00:16:17,050 --> 00:16:21,130
obviously the receptionist is using a

447
00:16:18,610 --> 00:16:23,139
machine hence the machine is also as a

448
00:16:21,130 --> 00:16:25,149
value and we could also pretend to be

449
00:16:23,139 --> 00:16:26,589
the guest when the room is being cleaned

450
00:16:25,149 --> 00:16:29,560
we could also pretend to be the cleaner

451
00:16:26,589 --> 00:16:31,089
and then try and get in so maybe there's

452
00:16:29,560 --> 00:16:33,699
two different ways them involving that

453
00:16:31,089 --> 00:16:35,319
so two different types of spoofing mmm

454
00:16:33,699 --> 00:16:37,599
and there's so many different ways now

455
00:16:35,319 --> 00:16:40,029
but and we need to know like how are we

456
00:16:37,600 --> 00:16:41,709
going to make sure we've got them all so

457
00:16:40,029 --> 00:16:43,870
it turns out you could try and think

458
00:16:41,709 --> 00:16:45,160
about yeah baby from different points of

459
00:16:43,870 --> 00:16:47,589
view you can think about different

460
00:16:45,160 --> 00:16:49,120
assets which might be valuable so maybe

461
00:16:47,589 --> 00:16:51,279
we actually want suitcase contents

462
00:16:49,120 --> 00:16:53,709
rather than the room access itself so we

463
00:16:51,279 --> 00:16:55,449
could think about how how that s it

464
00:16:53,709 --> 00:16:57,369
moves around and we can think about

465
00:16:55,449 --> 00:16:58,540
types of people and of course if we

466
00:16:57,370 --> 00:17:00,310
think about types of people we might

467
00:16:58,540 --> 00:17:03,089
come up with new methods of getting into

468
00:17:00,310 --> 00:17:06,040
the room so if we think about say

469
00:17:03,089 --> 00:17:07,959
cleaners guest concierge concierge is a

470
00:17:06,040 --> 00:17:09,399
new type of person like how do they

471
00:17:07,959 --> 00:17:11,500
operate in hotels they probably have

472
00:17:09,400 --> 00:17:13,270
some sort of master key they've got some

473
00:17:11,500 --> 00:17:16,929
severe you know trust relationship that

474
00:17:13,270 --> 00:17:18,939
allows them into into rooms and then you

475
00:17:16,929 --> 00:17:20,799
can think of activities so cleaners

476
00:17:18,939 --> 00:17:23,110
clean rooms receptionist to do stuff

477
00:17:20,799 --> 00:17:24,790
like issue and print keys and so on and

478
00:17:23,109 --> 00:17:25,359
concierge can investigate room problems

479
00:17:24,790 --> 00:17:27,399
when the guests

480
00:17:25,359 --> 00:17:29,020
out and just by stating that we know

481
00:17:27,400 --> 00:17:30,670
there's a problem because or there's a

482
00:17:29,020 --> 00:17:31,960
potential threat because concierge

483
00:17:30,670 --> 00:17:34,299
clearly have a way of getting into a

484
00:17:31,960 --> 00:17:38,320
room when the guests are out in this

485
00:17:34,299 --> 00:17:39,340
particular example okay so you might

486
00:17:38,320 --> 00:17:43,059
have seen these sorts of things before

487
00:17:39,340 --> 00:17:45,370
and so Microsoft refers to stride and

488
00:17:43,059 --> 00:17:47,770
dread as way of ways of potentially

489
00:17:45,370 --> 00:17:49,030
thinking about potential problems once

490
00:17:47,770 --> 00:17:50,559
you think you've understood enough about

491
00:17:49,030 --> 00:17:52,450
how the hotel works and then all the

492
00:17:50,559 --> 00:17:54,670
operations you can now start to think

493
00:17:52,450 --> 00:17:56,559
about the different threats and that

494
00:17:54,670 --> 00:17:58,480
might occur so I might try and like

495
00:17:56,559 --> 00:18:00,490
spoof something I might try and like

496
00:17:58,480 --> 00:18:01,990
sample with something I might elevate my

497
00:18:00,490 --> 00:18:03,460
privilege somehow get behind the desk

498
00:18:01,990 --> 00:18:05,400
and so on and so there's various

499
00:18:03,460 --> 00:18:08,830
different ways of potentially getting in

500
00:18:05,400 --> 00:18:11,679
okay so in summary brief summary anyway

501
00:18:08,830 --> 00:18:15,189
so we can create and find problems that

502
00:18:11,679 --> 00:18:16,990
tools can't find so basically like

503
00:18:15,190 --> 00:18:19,000
threat modeling works on hotels as well

504
00:18:16,990 --> 00:18:20,740
as it works on web apps and so it will

505
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:22,419
outlive technology so this is something

506
00:18:20,740 --> 00:18:24,400
that would work in sort of you know ten

507
00:18:22,419 --> 00:18:27,250
years time 20 years time and with

508
00:18:24,400 --> 00:18:29,080
technologies we haven't invented yet and

509
00:18:27,250 --> 00:18:31,510
so just wanted to run through like some

510
00:18:29,080 --> 00:18:33,040
quick high-profile hacks and there won't

511
00:18:31,510 --> 00:18:35,559
be much time so you can read up about

512
00:18:33,040 --> 00:18:37,899
these later but maybe you could guess

513
00:18:35,559 --> 00:18:40,570
some of the bugs here okay so am this

514
00:18:37,900 --> 00:18:42,429
was the apple and AT&T so you might know

515
00:18:40,570 --> 00:18:45,428
these sorts of situations but AT&T

516
00:18:42,429 --> 00:18:47,230
allowed access to pre registered devices

517
00:18:45,429 --> 00:18:49,450
they gave out breed registered devices

518
00:18:47,230 --> 00:18:51,070
you got a pre register device and you

519
00:18:49,450 --> 00:18:52,750
were able to come on as the celebrity

520
00:18:51,070 --> 00:18:54,639
and start like getting enthusiastic

521
00:18:52,750 --> 00:18:56,950
about the device and blogging about it

522
00:18:54,640 --> 00:18:58,570
and the way it worked the web servers

523
00:18:56,950 --> 00:19:01,179
read in an ICC ID which is issued

524
00:18:58,570 --> 00:19:03,490
sequentially to customers and it was

525
00:19:01,179 --> 00:19:06,190
directed to ipad via a user agent header

526
00:19:03,490 --> 00:19:09,370
so pretty obvious bug there hopefully

527
00:19:06,190 --> 00:19:11,020
too obvious bugs so anyone can pretend

528
00:19:09,370 --> 00:19:13,719
to be an iPad just by changing the user

529
00:19:11,020 --> 00:19:16,510
agent and obviously like and pretty much

530
00:19:13,720 --> 00:19:21,549
anyone can spoof the iccid particularly

531
00:19:16,510 --> 00:19:23,260
if they know one of them okay um so I'll

532
00:19:21,549 --> 00:19:25,570
skip through like a couple of these and

533
00:19:23,260 --> 00:19:26,919
just to get some other interesting ones

534
00:19:25,570 --> 00:19:28,059
I think this is a nice one because this

535
00:19:26,919 --> 00:19:30,490
is guy who hacked something by accident

536
00:19:28,059 --> 00:19:32,230
and so he was trying to get to

537
00:19:30,490 --> 00:19:34,750
unfiltered access to the Internet saw

538
00:19:32,230 --> 00:19:36,400
the holy grail for all techies and he

539
00:19:34,750 --> 00:19:38,680
basically went through an SSH tunnel and

540
00:19:36,400 --> 00:19:39,970
fired up a squid proxy

541
00:19:38,680 --> 00:19:42,220
and when he went to stack overflow he

542
00:19:39,970 --> 00:19:44,470
got all the admin menus um the reason he

543
00:19:42,220 --> 00:19:45,970
got the admin menus so i don't know if

544
00:19:44,470 --> 00:19:48,130
it's immediately obvious but he's going

545
00:19:45,970 --> 00:19:50,530
through a squid proxy now squid proxy

546
00:19:48,130 --> 00:19:52,390
adds an X forwarded for header to say

547
00:19:50,530 --> 00:19:54,639
who it's coming from and it's the next

548
00:19:52,390 --> 00:19:56,440
forwarded for local host so in sac over

549
00:19:54,640 --> 00:19:58,480
forgot the request it got like oh this

550
00:19:56,440 --> 00:20:01,300
is a local guy show the local interface

551
00:19:58,480 --> 00:20:03,850
because that's what we do so yeah you

552
00:20:01,300 --> 00:20:05,110
can read more about it under there so if

553
00:20:03,850 --> 00:20:06,459
you're tacking that by accident how many

554
00:20:05,110 --> 00:20:08,919
people are doing it on purpose and

555
00:20:06,460 --> 00:20:11,170
keeping a bit quiet about it and so

556
00:20:08,920 --> 00:20:13,240
maybe finally like em quite a nice bug

557
00:20:11,170 --> 00:20:15,010
against paypal and basically a series of

558
00:20:13,240 --> 00:20:16,570
bugs so each one might look like a

559
00:20:15,010 --> 00:20:18,010
medium low risk bug that you might throw

560
00:20:16,570 --> 00:20:19,870
on the pile and say well we'll deal with

561
00:20:18,010 --> 00:20:21,550
that in the backlog but if you put them

562
00:20:19,870 --> 00:20:24,040
all together it's basically a massive

563
00:20:21,550 --> 00:20:27,580
you serious bug so what this guy

564
00:20:24,040 --> 00:20:29,139
realized was that in paypal manager you

565
00:20:27,580 --> 00:20:32,110
could basically issue a password reset

566
00:20:29,140 --> 00:20:35,080
and you were given a token that was used

567
00:20:32,110 --> 00:20:36,550
to identify your reset process and if

568
00:20:35,080 --> 00:20:38,980
you took that token but didn't complete

569
00:20:36,550 --> 00:20:41,379
your own reset and you switched context

570
00:20:38,980 --> 00:20:44,170
somebody else's then the context became

571
00:20:41,380 --> 00:20:47,560
associated with their account and then

572
00:20:44,170 --> 00:20:49,750
your token became valid for them okay so

573
00:20:47,560 --> 00:20:52,179
once he got that sorted out and he got

574
00:20:49,750 --> 00:20:53,920
so the process associated with them he

575
00:20:52,180 --> 00:20:56,320
found that he'd get past the account

576
00:20:53,920 --> 00:20:58,360
recovery question and then he had to get

577
00:20:56,320 --> 00:20:59,860
the password reset working so he tried

578
00:20:58,360 --> 00:21:02,350
to get password reset work initially and

579
00:20:59,860 --> 00:21:03,550
he realized it if you take out the

580
00:21:02,350 --> 00:21:05,469
strikes who's in the wrong place you

581
00:21:03,550 --> 00:21:07,360
took out the referer header and you took

582
00:21:05,470 --> 00:21:09,310
out the cookie header and then it failed

583
00:21:07,360 --> 00:21:12,280
open and it basically again relied on

584
00:21:09,310 --> 00:21:14,409
this this token key again which was his

585
00:21:12,280 --> 00:21:17,410
token key the ad from the the previous

586
00:21:14,410 --> 00:21:19,120
from his own reset she was able to reset

587
00:21:17,410 --> 00:21:22,390
somebody else's password by causing this

588
00:21:19,120 --> 00:21:24,010
sort of fail open condition at one final

589
00:21:22,390 --> 00:21:25,780
problem as you're probably aware when

590
00:21:24,010 --> 00:21:27,700
you're using things like PayPal and so

591
00:21:25,780 --> 00:21:29,740
on if you try and log on from a new

592
00:21:27,700 --> 00:21:31,240
address it comes up and says I don't

593
00:21:29,740 --> 00:21:33,820
know you are like I'm not going to let

594
00:21:31,240 --> 00:21:35,230
you on unless unless I recognize you and

595
00:21:33,820 --> 00:21:39,070
of course like the way to get around

596
00:21:35,230 --> 00:21:42,070
that and maybe looks familiar so he went

597
00:21:39,070 --> 00:21:43,330
for x-forwarded-for localhost and that

598
00:21:42,070 --> 00:21:45,010
turned up to be a white listed address

599
00:21:43,330 --> 00:21:50,320
so thought well you're allowed to do

600
00:21:45,010 --> 00:21:52,600
resets from the local host okay okay so

601
00:21:50,320 --> 00:21:55,020
there have been like various other bugs

602
00:21:52,600 --> 00:21:58,270
again like in high-profile targets like

603
00:21:55,020 --> 00:21:59,860
github and so so if you know this guy a

604
00:21:58,270 --> 00:22:03,490
Hummer cough has found a few bugs

605
00:21:59,860 --> 00:22:06,969
against github so basically it's it's a

606
00:22:03,490 --> 00:22:09,070
vulnerability in MVC and basically in

607
00:22:06,970 --> 00:22:11,350
summary it's a vulnerability in the fact

608
00:22:09,070 --> 00:22:13,300
that there's a way of creating users

609
00:22:11,350 --> 00:22:15,610
which is done by admins the way or not

610
00:22:13,300 --> 00:22:18,159
operating on things as an admin and

611
00:22:15,610 --> 00:22:21,370
normal users actually call into the same

612
00:22:18,160 --> 00:22:23,350
bit of code but if a normal user can

613
00:22:21,370 --> 00:22:26,530
guess the right parameters then those

614
00:22:23,350 --> 00:22:29,800
parameters will be used if they exist on

615
00:22:26,530 --> 00:22:32,620
the on the admin functionality and so

616
00:22:29,800 --> 00:22:34,480
sorry I'm running a little bit out time

617
00:22:32,620 --> 00:22:36,850
but this is basically all he had to do

618
00:22:34,480 --> 00:22:39,160
he had to ads like parameter called

619
00:22:36,850 --> 00:22:41,439
public key user ID equals and then he

620
00:22:39,160 --> 00:22:43,690
picked the the rails user and he got his

621
00:22:41,440 --> 00:22:47,410
public key associated with the the rails

622
00:22:43,690 --> 00:22:49,780
user ok so again like a pretty easy

623
00:22:47,410 --> 00:22:51,310
potentially easy high-profile hack not

624
00:22:49,780 --> 00:22:52,629
too difficult to guess hopefully you

625
00:22:51,310 --> 00:22:54,790
found out the user ID pretty easily

626
00:22:52,630 --> 00:22:58,720
again you can read up more about it

627
00:22:54,790 --> 00:23:00,370
there ok so I'm gonna just skip ahead

628
00:22:58,720 --> 00:23:03,100
cuz I'd prefer to take questions

629
00:23:00,370 --> 00:23:06,100
probably rather than going through too

630
00:23:03,100 --> 00:23:07,570
much more so firstly like chem hopefully

631
00:23:06,100 --> 00:23:09,820
these floors don't seem too hard to

632
00:23:07,570 --> 00:23:11,560
understand ok so em you know they're

633
00:23:09,820 --> 00:23:13,120
very very trivial once once I've talked

634
00:23:11,560 --> 00:23:14,770
about it and we didn't need to reach for

635
00:23:13,120 --> 00:23:17,169
a computer in order to find these bugs

636
00:23:14,770 --> 00:23:19,240
and I just sort up here explained what

637
00:23:17,170 --> 00:23:20,680
it was like and what the premise was and

638
00:23:19,240 --> 00:23:22,000
almost instantly you probably started

639
00:23:20,680 --> 00:23:24,910
smiling and when I know what the problem

640
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:26,730
is so a description of the environment

641
00:23:24,910 --> 00:23:29,380
was enough to realize what the bug was

642
00:23:26,730 --> 00:23:33,460
so it's more about thinking than it is

643
00:23:29,380 --> 00:23:35,530
about automating ok so am upset call a

644
00:23:33,460 --> 00:23:37,690
halt there so what I just like to say

645
00:23:35,530 --> 00:23:39,520
and these automated tools and people

646
00:23:37,690 --> 00:23:40,750
talk about low hanging fruit please

647
00:23:39,520 --> 00:23:42,250
don't use the term low hanging fruit

648
00:23:40,750 --> 00:23:44,380
join me and use a term like low-hanging

649
00:23:42,250 --> 00:23:45,730
pairs ok because they don't find

650
00:23:44,380 --> 00:23:47,230
low-hanging apples there's a lot of

651
00:23:45,730 --> 00:23:48,940
low-hanging apples out there if you use

652
00:23:47,230 --> 00:23:51,220
automated tools your security baseline

653
00:23:48,940 --> 00:23:52,960
doesn't go from there to there it gets

654
00:23:51,220 --> 00:23:55,090
better but there are still easy bugs out

655
00:23:52,960 --> 00:23:59,620
there and they just they're just not

656
00:23:55,090 --> 00:24:01,179
findable by the tools ok um so probably

657
00:23:59,620 --> 00:24:04,969
good time to take questions and if I'm

658
00:24:01,180 --> 00:24:17,030
allowed any time for questions yep

659
00:24:04,970 --> 00:24:21,350
if there are any okay yeah absolutely

660
00:24:17,030 --> 00:24:23,090
yet so um yes so if you if you if you if

661
00:24:21,350 --> 00:24:25,520
you own an application you've invested

662
00:24:23,090 --> 00:24:26,809
the time to configure the tools to look

663
00:24:25,520 --> 00:24:29,059
for all the bugs that you know about and

664
00:24:26,809 --> 00:24:31,280
so on then regression is probably a

665
00:24:29,059 --> 00:24:33,590
really good really good use case so

666
00:24:31,280 --> 00:24:35,030
things like BDD security and like some

667
00:24:33,590 --> 00:24:37,789
of these other tools that you know more

668
00:24:35,030 --> 00:24:39,559
custom written yes absolutely and

669
00:24:37,789 --> 00:24:40,700
because you know exactly what you're

670
00:24:39,559 --> 00:24:50,350
looking for when you're looking for a

671
00:24:40,700 --> 00:24:53,030
regression so it makes perfect sense um

672
00:24:50,350 --> 00:24:55,370
whiteboards people's phones of the

673
00:24:53,030 --> 00:24:57,559
whiteboard and I I don't know the answer

674
00:24:55,370 --> 00:25:00,219
to what what are you trying to do just

675
00:24:57,559 --> 00:25:05,750
store them for posterity update them

676
00:25:00,220 --> 00:25:07,039
share them I don't know um I actually

677
00:25:05,750 --> 00:25:08,929
don't know the answer i don't if anyone

678
00:25:07,039 --> 00:25:11,510
else here might know the answer like em

679
00:25:08,929 --> 00:25:13,340
I think you know the threat models that

680
00:25:11,510 --> 00:25:15,080
I've seen being produced tend to be like

681
00:25:13,340 --> 00:25:17,090
care you know whiteboard diagrams and

682
00:25:15,080 --> 00:25:19,250
then like case of everyone screenshots

683
00:25:17,090 --> 00:25:21,980
and some comments come out and you get

684
00:25:19,250 --> 00:25:23,960
some sort of document but I haven't seen

685
00:25:21,980 --> 00:25:27,620
a nice kind of living document type

686
00:25:23,960 --> 00:25:29,809
thing that oh maybe irias risk I haven't

687
00:25:27,620 --> 00:25:32,030
seen it yet but yeah I think the guys

688
00:25:29,809 --> 00:25:33,470
downstairs talking about it so I think

689
00:25:32,030 --> 00:25:35,710
there is a sort of living document form

690
00:25:33,470 --> 00:25:35,710
there

691
00:25:42,009 --> 00:25:46,249
get help Margot so that's where we

692
00:25:45,110 --> 00:25:48,729
scaling and we couldn't read multiple

693
00:25:46,249 --> 00:25:52,940
layers so the question for you it was

694
00:25:48,730 --> 00:25:54,950
how do we communicate these issues with

695
00:25:52,940 --> 00:25:58,129
developers right so do my view is we

696
00:25:54,950 --> 00:26:01,279
write tests to communicate with them so

697
00:25:58,129 --> 00:26:03,799
they can replicate this yeah um so I

698
00:26:01,279 --> 00:26:05,929
think my approach which is necessarily

699
00:26:03,799 --> 00:26:08,299
the only one is to give awareness

700
00:26:05,929 --> 00:26:11,059
sessions a bit like this maybe over a

701
00:26:08,299 --> 00:26:12,499
longer period come in and do like a no

702
00:26:11,059 --> 00:26:14,299
trading courses and capture the flags

703
00:26:12,499 --> 00:26:16,999
and stuff and and get the thinking

704
00:26:14,299 --> 00:26:18,619
they're because I think like you can't

705
00:26:16,999 --> 00:26:21,080
necessarily write down everything in a

706
00:26:18,619 --> 00:26:22,759
documented way I think it's by feel it's

707
00:26:21,080 --> 00:26:25,340
more about the thinking really rather

708
00:26:22,759 --> 00:26:26,659
than the the information I think people

709
00:26:25,340 --> 00:26:28,490
are drowning in information sometimes

710
00:26:26,659 --> 00:26:30,830
like you've got the ASV S which has all

711
00:26:28,490 --> 00:26:32,539
the information you need but people

712
00:26:30,830 --> 00:26:35,178
don't use it because it's it's too much

713
00:26:32,539 --> 00:26:38,059
for them to use in my experience but I

714
00:26:35,179 --> 00:26:40,279
don't know how do you do it I try to

715
00:26:38,059 --> 00:26:42,860
write tests I totally can relate tests

716
00:26:40,279 --> 00:26:44,840
integration tests ok because the story

717
00:26:42,860 --> 00:26:46,879
of what you just described should be in

718
00:26:44,840 --> 00:26:49,279
a test it should be once you know about

719
00:26:46,879 --> 00:26:51,590
it should definitely be a test yeah so

720
00:26:49,279 --> 00:26:53,210
it's more the onesie my concern is the

721
00:26:51,590 --> 00:26:54,408
ones that people don't know about the

722
00:26:53,210 --> 00:26:56,570
people who haven't invested the time

723
00:26:54,409 --> 00:26:57,889
like maybe if your internal to a company

724
00:26:56,570 --> 00:26:59,559
and you've got the time invested to

725
00:26:57,889 --> 00:27:01,908
create these things on your own apps

726
00:26:59,559 --> 00:27:03,710
you're a lot better state than a lot of

727
00:27:01,909 --> 00:27:05,749
people who just buy at all expecting to

728
00:27:03,710 --> 00:27:11,809
make use of it and hope that it finds

729
00:27:05,749 --> 00:27:14,230
stuff but yep ok all right well thanks

730
00:27:11,809 --> 00:27:14,230
very much

731
00:27:17,260 --> 00:27:19,320
you
