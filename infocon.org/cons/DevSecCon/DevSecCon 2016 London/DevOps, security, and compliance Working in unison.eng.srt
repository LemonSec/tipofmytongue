1
00:00:00,500 --> 00:00:05,100
so thank you really appreciate the

2
00:00:03,629 --> 00:00:08,280
opportunity to meet with you today as

3
00:00:05,100 --> 00:00:09,928
some as friends so I mentioned I'm

4
00:00:08,280 --> 00:00:13,079
Elizabeth with dr. Elizabeth Lawler I'm

5
00:00:09,929 --> 00:00:15,269
here from Boston I'm here to talk about

6
00:00:13,080 --> 00:00:17,490
DevOps compliance and security working

7
00:00:15,269 --> 00:00:21,500
in unison in other words its compliance

8
00:00:17,490 --> 00:00:21,500
for people who hate the word compliance

9
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:29,939
let me tell you a little bit about

10
00:00:24,750 --> 00:00:32,189
myself and why I'm here I got into cyber

11
00:00:29,939 --> 00:00:33,360
security after a career in actually

12
00:00:32,189 --> 00:00:35,130
public health research I have a

13
00:00:33,360 --> 00:00:37,320
doctorate of epidemiology and

14
00:00:35,130 --> 00:00:40,290
biostatistics and I work for 15 years

15
00:00:37,320 --> 00:00:42,149
and regulated and compliant data systems

16
00:00:40,290 --> 00:00:46,649
building IT systems and software to do

17
00:00:42,149 --> 00:00:49,050
medical research and so I went to some

18
00:00:46,649 --> 00:00:51,629
of the things that turn me on are you

19
00:00:49,050 --> 00:00:54,120
know providing better security related

20
00:00:51,629 --> 00:00:55,920
experiences for businesses I'm really

21
00:00:54,120 --> 00:00:59,370
interested in access controls at scale

22
00:00:55,920 --> 00:01:00,840
for robots and machines and I'm also big

23
00:00:59,370 --> 00:01:04,798
fan of my husband kids dog cat and

24
00:01:00,840 --> 00:01:08,189
chickens so why would a public health

25
00:01:04,799 --> 00:01:10,860
person get involved in cyber security I

26
00:01:08,189 --> 00:01:14,369
was a programmer i worked in electronic

27
00:01:10,860 --> 00:01:16,020
medical record data systems and in 2006

28
00:01:14,369 --> 00:01:18,030
i was working at the US Department of

29
00:01:16,020 --> 00:01:20,250
Veterans Affairs so this is a this is a

30
00:01:18,030 --> 00:01:22,140
slide from information is beautiful it

31
00:01:20,250 --> 00:01:23,759
shows I don't know if you've seen this

32
00:01:22,140 --> 00:01:28,470
graphic before it's the biggest breaches

33
00:01:23,759 --> 00:01:30,780
by year and at the time the Department

34
00:01:28,470 --> 00:01:32,610
of Veterans Affairs last 26 million

35
00:01:30,780 --> 00:01:34,409
Social Security numbers and pieces of

36
00:01:32,610 --> 00:01:36,659
personally identifiable information off

37
00:01:34,409 --> 00:01:40,770
of someone's laptop and that was a

38
00:01:36,659 --> 00:01:42,659
galvanizing experience for me that could

39
00:01:40,770 --> 00:01:44,158
have happened to anyone in my research

40
00:01:42,659 --> 00:01:46,680
group it could have happened to a lot of

41
00:01:44,159 --> 00:01:50,310
people that I worked with we basically

42
00:01:46,680 --> 00:01:54,979
had unfettered access to incredibly

43
00:01:50,310 --> 00:01:57,450
sensitive information at the time and so

44
00:01:54,979 --> 00:01:58,920
around the time of 2006 I started

45
00:01:57,450 --> 00:02:01,290
getting interested in in cybersecurity

46
00:01:58,920 --> 00:02:02,579
well fat you know but I think it's

47
00:02:01,290 --> 00:02:04,710
evident that we're in the middle of an

48
00:02:02,579 --> 00:02:06,719
epidemic now of cyber security events

49
00:02:04,710 --> 00:02:08,878
and breeches so if you fast-forward from

50
00:02:06,719 --> 00:02:10,410
2006 you know we were sort of like the

51
00:02:08,878 --> 00:02:13,420
bad kid on the block back then but now

52
00:02:10,410 --> 00:02:17,440
look what happens so this is

53
00:02:13,420 --> 00:02:21,369
you know the next ten years of cyber

54
00:02:17,440 --> 00:02:25,120
security events huge massive hacks tons

55
00:02:21,370 --> 00:02:27,510
of data lost recently Yahoo was in the

56
00:02:25,120 --> 00:02:30,910
it was in the news for the 500 million

57
00:02:27,510 --> 00:02:32,859
records that were gone we're lost so you

58
00:02:30,910 --> 00:02:34,840
know cyber security events are growing

59
00:02:32,860 --> 00:02:37,300
at a kegger compound annual growth rate

60
00:02:34,840 --> 00:02:41,489
of forty-eight percent a year this is a

61
00:02:37,300 --> 00:02:44,800
huge problem for business worldwide and

62
00:02:41,489 --> 00:02:46,330
it represents a threat not only to the

63
00:02:44,800 --> 00:02:49,209
data that we're talking about here but

64
00:02:46,330 --> 00:02:52,239
it represents a threat to reputation to

65
00:02:49,209 --> 00:02:55,239
brand to shareholder value regulatory

66
00:02:52,239 --> 00:02:57,910
risk and it roads faith in organizations

67
00:02:55,239 --> 00:03:00,280
so my most one of my recent breaches

68
00:02:57,910 --> 00:03:01,720
that I was unfortunately a victim of was

69
00:03:00,280 --> 00:03:05,530
this one the US Office of Personnel

70
00:03:01,720 --> 00:03:07,959
Management they stole 15 years of

71
00:03:05,530 --> 00:03:09,400
records of people who had been vetted by

72
00:03:07,959 --> 00:03:12,310
the FBI to work for the u.s. government

73
00:03:09,400 --> 00:03:13,660
and so that felt really personal right

74
00:03:12,310 --> 00:03:15,640
like that's more than just my credit

75
00:03:13,660 --> 00:03:17,590
card and social security number it's all

76
00:03:15,640 --> 00:03:19,839
about me and everybody that I knew and

77
00:03:17,590 --> 00:03:22,120
everyone that the FBI had interviewed so

78
00:03:19,840 --> 00:03:23,920
I could work at the VA so this is

79
00:03:22,120 --> 00:03:25,840
becoming real it's really starting to

80
00:03:23,920 --> 00:03:31,480
impact our lives right at a very

81
00:03:25,840 --> 00:03:34,420
personal level and really what's driving

82
00:03:31,480 --> 00:03:36,160
all this is the rapid growth of data so

83
00:03:34,420 --> 00:03:38,260
right now I think we have seven or

84
00:03:36,160 --> 00:03:40,060
almost eight zettabytes of data out

85
00:03:38,260 --> 00:03:42,608
there in the world that's being stored

86
00:03:40,060 --> 00:03:44,500
by various kinds of companies and

87
00:03:42,609 --> 00:03:46,359
businesses it's going to grow to 35

88
00:03:44,500 --> 00:03:51,570
zettabytes how many people know what is

89
00:03:46,359 --> 00:03:51,570
that a bite is how much is that a bite

90
00:03:52,920 --> 00:03:58,530
million petabytes but you're close I

91
00:03:58,680 --> 00:04:03,280
mean it's huge just vast amounts of data

92
00:04:01,540 --> 00:04:08,370
that's being collected worldwide through

93
00:04:03,280 --> 00:04:10,989
all kinds of systems and we are people

94
00:04:08,370 --> 00:04:15,220
consumers are responsible for creating

95
00:04:10,989 --> 00:04:18,668
seventy percent of that data but

96
00:04:15,220 --> 00:04:21,070
companies enterprises often regulated

97
00:04:18,668 --> 00:04:22,840
groups and businesses are responsible

98
00:04:21,070 --> 00:04:25,240
for maintaining the security of eighty

99
00:04:22,840 --> 00:04:28,770
percent of that data so it's our data

100
00:04:25,240 --> 00:04:28,770
but other people have to secure it

101
00:04:29,520 --> 00:04:35,320
and it's coming from everywhere so the

102
00:04:33,670 --> 00:04:39,520
number of at-risk connections is just

103
00:04:35,320 --> 00:04:41,140
increasing at an exponential rate and

104
00:04:39,520 --> 00:04:43,240
it's getting more and more heterogeneous

105
00:04:41,140 --> 00:04:47,530
where the where information is coming

106
00:04:43,240 --> 00:04:50,110
from so for example a IOT is something

107
00:04:47,530 --> 00:04:55,090
like a 2.5 trillion dollar industry it's

108
00:04:50,110 --> 00:04:58,660
expected to grow to 15 trillion by you

109
00:04:55,090 --> 00:05:00,429
know by 2020 and these are all systems

110
00:04:58,660 --> 00:05:03,310
that collect information through

111
00:05:00,430 --> 00:05:07,240
software that's of material value right

112
00:05:03,310 --> 00:05:09,580
it's it's everything from my banking and

113
00:05:07,240 --> 00:05:13,210
account information to my refrigerator

114
00:05:09,580 --> 00:05:17,050
to my car all of this is connected by

115
00:05:13,210 --> 00:05:18,700
software and back status so what's

116
00:05:17,050 --> 00:05:21,610
really so the problem here and the

117
00:05:18,700 --> 00:05:25,210
reason why this event is so important is

118
00:05:21,610 --> 00:05:27,100
that sec DevOps is the next iteration of

119
00:05:25,210 --> 00:05:30,479
how we're going to be able to manage and

120
00:05:27,100 --> 00:05:32,440
secure and control and comply with

121
00:05:30,480 --> 00:05:36,120
regulation in this in this new

122
00:05:32,440 --> 00:05:38,680
fast-moving huge giant scale world um

123
00:05:36,120 --> 00:05:41,280
and the fact of the matter is we can we

124
00:05:38,680 --> 00:05:43,720
can really no longer rely on people to

125
00:05:41,280 --> 00:05:46,390
be able to keep up with the pace of

126
00:05:43,720 --> 00:05:48,580
security needs we need to automate the

127
00:05:46,390 --> 00:05:50,349
the problem in rolling out security

128
00:05:48,580 --> 00:05:52,990
especially in highly regulated

129
00:05:50,350 --> 00:05:54,640
environments and how so how many of you

130
00:05:52,990 --> 00:05:58,750
work in a highly regulated environment

131
00:05:54,640 --> 00:06:01,630
banking health care yeah so you probably

132
00:05:58,750 --> 00:06:03,510
know that most things that are sensitive

133
00:06:01,630 --> 00:06:06,419
are provisioned of still by people

134
00:06:03,510 --> 00:06:10,270
things like access credentials

135
00:06:06,419 --> 00:06:13,900
onboarding etc and the way that those

136
00:06:10,270 --> 00:06:16,180
systems were designed was with controls

137
00:06:13,900 --> 00:06:18,280
that were essentially accountable to

138
00:06:16,180 --> 00:06:21,580
people but as we move into these high

139
00:06:18,280 --> 00:06:24,400
velocity IT systems cloud DevOps IOT

140
00:06:21,580 --> 00:06:26,140
we're talking about you know millions

141
00:06:24,400 --> 00:06:27,700
you know hundreds to millions of system

142
00:06:26,140 --> 00:06:29,710
components they're moving really fast

143
00:06:27,700 --> 00:06:32,469
the average life expectancy of a

144
00:06:29,710 --> 00:06:34,719
containers less than three days you can

145
00:06:32,470 --> 00:06:38,400
no longer use people in those processes

146
00:06:34,720 --> 00:06:38,400
so you have to do something different

147
00:06:39,070 --> 00:06:44,770
in addition security gets spread across

148
00:06:42,730 --> 00:06:47,320
lots of different tools so you have a

149
00:06:44,770 --> 00:06:49,030
widely interconnected group of systems

150
00:06:47,320 --> 00:06:50,680
of which you could have convened

151
00:06:49,030 --> 00:06:52,570
garrison management you have multi cloud

152
00:06:50,680 --> 00:06:54,760
systems you have all sorts of different

153
00:06:52,570 --> 00:06:58,719
platforms that you're using and so the

154
00:06:54,760 --> 00:07:02,050
concerns sort of shift from in you know

155
00:06:58,720 --> 00:07:05,740
insider threat and physical damage or

156
00:07:02,050 --> 00:07:07,930
physical or environmental risks to data

157
00:07:05,740 --> 00:07:10,900
to things like tampered code hijack

158
00:07:07,930 --> 00:07:13,600
systems compromised puppet servers for

159
00:07:10,900 --> 00:07:15,580
example these are the new threat surface

160
00:07:13,600 --> 00:07:18,180
that the business is thinking about when

161
00:07:15,580 --> 00:07:20,710
we're moving to these new systems so in

162
00:07:18,180 --> 00:07:22,900
so in a containerized cloud environment

163
00:07:20,710 --> 00:07:25,030
you know you really have to think about

164
00:07:22,900 --> 00:07:26,950
how you can automate and systematize

165
00:07:25,030 --> 00:07:31,599
some of the controls that might be

166
00:07:26,950 --> 00:07:33,190
necessary for your business so unless

167
00:07:31,600 --> 00:07:36,970
you're really red teaming your systems

168
00:07:33,190 --> 00:07:39,250
every day it's very hard to find all of

169
00:07:36,970 --> 00:07:40,930
the potential connection points that

170
00:07:39,250 --> 00:07:42,490
that could potentially be compromised

171
00:07:40,930 --> 00:07:49,920
without putting some sort of automated

172
00:07:42,490 --> 00:07:53,620
systems in place but you can't slow down

173
00:07:49,920 --> 00:07:56,290
so I mean you know DevOps has been

174
00:07:53,620 --> 00:07:58,330
proven to provide tremendous business

175
00:07:56,290 --> 00:08:00,850
value and competitive advantage to

176
00:07:58,330 --> 00:08:03,640
companies who adopted this is here this

177
00:08:00,850 --> 00:08:06,610
is coming DevOps is here being able to

178
00:08:03,640 --> 00:08:09,130
move at velocity represents you know

179
00:08:06,610 --> 00:08:11,560
improved customer experiences faster

180
00:08:09,130 --> 00:08:15,010
time-to-market automation delivers real

181
00:08:11,560 --> 00:08:17,500
value so as software developers and as

182
00:08:15,010 --> 00:08:21,969
system administrators and as DevOps or

183
00:08:17,500 --> 00:08:24,820
suck people we have embraced the sort of

184
00:08:21,970 --> 00:08:26,740
organizational methodological and

185
00:08:24,820 --> 00:08:30,390
technological changes that come with

186
00:08:26,740 --> 00:08:33,849
this type of system right agile DevOps

187
00:08:30,390 --> 00:08:35,830
organizations so you're you I mean you

188
00:08:33,849 --> 00:08:37,960
really want we've won the day this is

189
00:08:35,830 --> 00:08:40,300
definitely being adopted across work

190
00:08:37,960 --> 00:08:42,669
across different kinds of industries but

191
00:08:40,299 --> 00:08:44,709
the grand prize for that is that now

192
00:08:42,669 --> 00:08:46,840
everyone's looking at you they're

193
00:08:44,710 --> 00:08:49,270
looking at your systems they're looking

194
00:08:46,840 --> 00:08:50,740
at what you're doing they want to know

195
00:08:49,270 --> 00:08:52,720
that the business is safe and secure

196
00:08:50,740 --> 00:08:57,459
using these high velocity tools

197
00:08:52,720 --> 00:08:59,439
and so compliance is like the booby

198
00:08:57,459 --> 00:09:04,628
prize for getting for kidding where you

199
00:08:59,439 --> 00:09:06,009
are so now we're like taking all of

200
00:09:04,629 --> 00:09:08,470
these systems and they're coming under

201
00:09:06,009 --> 00:09:12,459
the sort of lens of risk and compliance

202
00:09:08,470 --> 00:09:15,189
and increasingly the business lens of

203
00:09:12,459 --> 00:09:19,180
risk and compliance for various brands

204
00:09:15,189 --> 00:09:21,399
so the first step was to sort of get all

205
00:09:19,180 --> 00:09:24,099
the systems aligned you know tame the

206
00:09:21,399 --> 00:09:26,560
monsters get going on this fast

207
00:09:24,100 --> 00:09:27,939
continuous delivery pathway which allows

208
00:09:26,560 --> 00:09:30,638
incremental change and faster

209
00:09:27,939 --> 00:09:34,300
time-to-value but then the security

210
00:09:30,639 --> 00:09:36,430
folks showed up so DevOps was the is the

211
00:09:34,300 --> 00:09:38,139
you know portmanteau of development and

212
00:09:36,430 --> 00:09:40,349
operations now it's tech dev ops

213
00:09:38,139 --> 00:09:44,759
eventually it will be compliance is

214
00:09:40,350 --> 00:09:48,160
value set gobs or something the the

215
00:09:44,759 --> 00:09:51,009
setups people showed up and this is what

216
00:09:48,160 --> 00:09:52,569
they saw so you've set up your CI CD

217
00:09:51,009 --> 00:09:54,910
pipeline you've got everything rolling

218
00:09:52,569 --> 00:09:57,519
you've got really great uptime all your

219
00:09:54,910 --> 00:09:59,170
metrics are awesome and then the

220
00:09:57,519 --> 00:10:01,149
security people or the compliance people

221
00:09:59,170 --> 00:10:02,949
looked at it and said oh man so we've

222
00:10:01,149 --> 00:10:05,170
got infrastructure code developers put

223
00:10:02,949 --> 00:10:06,729
in credentials and github you know get

224
00:10:05,170 --> 00:10:09,910
fished admin creds that could compromise

225
00:10:06,730 --> 00:10:11,529
this whole entire platform um somebody's

226
00:10:09,910 --> 00:10:14,139
that could potentially side-channel IT

227
00:10:11,529 --> 00:10:15,790
resources for Bitcoin mining I have

228
00:10:14,139 --> 00:10:18,250
actually seen this happen actually you

229
00:10:15,790 --> 00:10:19,839
know and one organization we worked with

230
00:10:18,250 --> 00:10:22,209
people are worried about out of that

231
00:10:19,839 --> 00:10:24,819
libraries malware injections the whole

232
00:10:22,209 --> 00:10:27,369
nine yards so this represents a huge

233
00:10:24,819 --> 00:10:29,349
threat surface that companies now are

234
00:10:27,370 --> 00:10:31,360
worried about compromising their

235
00:10:29,350 --> 00:10:33,370
business and the more tailored your

236
00:10:31,360 --> 00:10:34,360
pipelines are if you have you know

237
00:10:33,370 --> 00:10:35,769
there's kind of two different ways of

238
00:10:34,360 --> 00:10:37,930
doing this having many different

239
00:10:35,769 --> 00:10:39,430
pipelines are having one uber pipeline

240
00:10:37,930 --> 00:10:41,769
for your business if you have one uber

241
00:10:39,430 --> 00:10:44,859
pipeline for your business this is your

242
00:10:41,769 --> 00:10:46,420
business in a nutshell and it's bit and

243
00:10:44,860 --> 00:10:49,660
it's and it's sitting there waiting to

244
00:10:46,420 --> 00:10:51,120
be compromised or used in ways you

245
00:10:49,660 --> 00:10:55,769
weren't you weren't necessarily

246
00:10:51,120 --> 00:10:55,769
anticipating um

247
00:10:57,830 --> 00:11:02,030
so Josh Korman who's one of the founding

248
00:10:59,930 --> 00:11:03,709
team members of sonatype who's here from

249
00:11:02,030 --> 00:11:06,980
sonatype I know there's some thai people

250
00:11:03,710 --> 00:11:10,640
downstairs anybody okay he talks about

251
00:11:06,980 --> 00:11:14,540
the software delivery pipeline and the

252
00:11:10,640 --> 00:11:18,080
fact that you know basically we've come

253
00:11:14,540 --> 00:11:20,270
up with regulations and requirements for

254
00:11:18,080 --> 00:11:21,650
supply chain to make quality products

255
00:11:20,270 --> 00:11:24,590
for things that really make a difference

256
00:11:21,650 --> 00:11:27,740
in our lives right like cars medical

257
00:11:24,590 --> 00:11:29,570
devices etc this software owing to all

258
00:11:27,740 --> 00:11:31,610
that data and all those connected

259
00:11:29,570 --> 00:11:35,210
devices that are all touching our lives

260
00:11:31,610 --> 00:11:36,800
now really needs to be looked at the

261
00:11:35,210 --> 00:11:40,870
through the same kind of lens of

262
00:11:36,800 --> 00:11:45,469
delivering quality products and secure

263
00:11:40,870 --> 00:11:47,440
essentially a supply chain for the for

264
00:11:45,470 --> 00:11:49,880
the next generation of software products

265
00:11:47,440 --> 00:11:51,740
so built he says building your solutions

266
00:11:49,880 --> 00:11:53,810
at the highest level of quality means

267
00:11:51,740 --> 00:11:56,630
they can handle adverse circumstances of

268
00:11:53,810 --> 00:11:58,040
which cybersecurity threats are one

269
00:11:56,630 --> 00:12:03,310
source of those types of adverse

270
00:11:58,040 --> 00:12:06,319
circumstances so now that I sort of

271
00:12:03,310 --> 00:12:08,660
questions comments thoughts so now that

272
00:12:06,320 --> 00:12:10,250
I've laid out sort of where the business

273
00:12:08,660 --> 00:12:13,339
is looking and what they're concerned

274
00:12:10,250 --> 00:12:18,290
about and where how this momentum is all

275
00:12:13,340 --> 00:12:19,610
sort of coming around DevOps and DevOps

276
00:12:18,290 --> 00:12:21,949
pipelines it's like where do you begin

277
00:12:19,610 --> 00:12:23,960
it's so huge what should i do should I

278
00:12:21,950 --> 00:12:26,090
just start on a credential hunt do I

279
00:12:23,960 --> 00:12:29,930
need to rethink my pipeline what's the

280
00:12:26,090 --> 00:12:32,060
next step here so I think we we can all

281
00:12:29,930 --> 00:12:33,380
agree that security is everybody's job I

282
00:12:32,060 --> 00:12:35,150
mean we're working inside of our

283
00:12:33,380 --> 00:12:37,040
organizations to shift security left

284
00:12:35,150 --> 00:12:39,890
early in the software development

285
00:12:37,040 --> 00:12:42,079
process getting security folks involved

286
00:12:39,890 --> 00:12:45,980
with DevOps early on in in software

287
00:12:42,080 --> 00:12:48,020
design security you know having security

288
00:12:45,980 --> 00:12:52,130
early on in the process reduces

289
00:12:48,020 --> 00:12:54,439
technical debt prevents rework less time

290
00:12:52,130 --> 00:12:57,290
writing code embedded security also

291
00:12:54,440 --> 00:13:00,200
improves consistency across software

292
00:12:57,290 --> 00:13:02,689
products but what's so how does

293
00:13:00,200 --> 00:13:05,240
compliance play into this compliance is

294
00:13:02,690 --> 00:13:10,040
basically the demonstration that you

295
00:13:05,240 --> 00:13:11,540
have trustworthy practices at work

296
00:13:10,040 --> 00:13:12,980
inside of your organization

297
00:13:11,540 --> 00:13:17,360
building critical things like software

298
00:13:12,980 --> 00:13:19,009
products and demonstrating that proving

299
00:13:17,360 --> 00:13:20,449
it proving that you have security

300
00:13:19,009 --> 00:13:23,300
controls in place proving that you're

301
00:13:20,449 --> 00:13:25,189
reducing risk for the business is the is

302
00:13:23,300 --> 00:13:28,430
the goal of any kind of compliance or

303
00:13:25,190 --> 00:13:30,709
regulatory framework so bringing

304
00:13:28,430 --> 00:13:33,290
compliance in early in the process to

305
00:13:30,709 --> 00:13:35,540
define what's in scope what's not in

306
00:13:33,290 --> 00:13:38,060
scope etc for regulatory controls is

307
00:13:35,540 --> 00:13:41,509
actually very similar to bringing SEC

308
00:13:38,060 --> 00:13:46,189
into the software delivery process early

309
00:13:41,509 --> 00:13:48,709
on so the step first step one is unify

310
00:13:46,190 --> 00:13:52,060
your team your engineering team your ops

311
00:13:48,709 --> 00:13:54,138
team your sec team with compliance

312
00:13:52,060 --> 00:13:58,849
because they're just wondering can we

313
00:13:54,139 --> 00:14:07,699
trust these people I don't trust that

314
00:13:58,850 --> 00:14:09,980
guy um so like all good software start

315
00:14:07,699 --> 00:14:13,939
with a story right meet the compliance

316
00:14:09,980 --> 00:14:15,410
team part of every project where you're

317
00:14:13,940 --> 00:14:18,019
designing and deploying a new system of

318
00:14:15,410 --> 00:14:19,850
workflow or workflow you should fit you

319
00:14:18,019 --> 00:14:22,399
should go to that go to compliance early

320
00:14:19,850 --> 00:14:25,550
and ask them is this potentially in spec

321
00:14:22,399 --> 00:14:27,709
or in scope for a regular for regulation

322
00:14:25,550 --> 00:14:29,420
for my business it's surprising how

323
00:14:27,709 --> 00:14:32,420
little I was talking with someone

324
00:14:29,420 --> 00:14:34,519
earlier it's just surprising how many

325
00:14:32,420 --> 00:14:37,219
people don't really know uh whether

326
00:14:34,519 --> 00:14:38,959
their application might potentially have

327
00:14:37,220 --> 00:14:41,870
a regulatory impact or not especially in

328
00:14:38,959 --> 00:14:44,569
small business it's it's worth it to

329
00:14:41,870 --> 00:14:47,319
hire experts or have a network of

330
00:14:44,569 --> 00:14:51,170
experts that you can reach out to to ask

331
00:14:47,319 --> 00:14:53,810
gather requirements and plan it into the

332
00:14:51,170 --> 00:14:55,279
project from the beginning so who's your

333
00:14:53,810 --> 00:14:57,170
compliance officer well it could be a

334
00:14:55,279 --> 00:14:58,699
business owner right someone who owns

335
00:14:57,170 --> 00:15:01,430
responsibility for the risk to the

336
00:14:58,699 --> 00:15:04,459
business what if my systems attacked and

337
00:15:01,430 --> 00:15:06,109
we have reputation emerge what if you

338
00:15:04,459 --> 00:15:09,008
know in the case of Yahoo what if it's

339
00:15:06,110 --> 00:15:11,899
going to hacked a merger and acquisition

340
00:15:09,009 --> 00:15:15,439
I have a friend who's a compliance

341
00:15:11,899 --> 00:15:16,699
officer and you know she when people see

342
00:15:15,439 --> 00:15:19,160
her coming down the hall they close

343
00:15:16,699 --> 00:15:20,329
their doors and hide under the desks you

344
00:15:19,160 --> 00:15:23,899
know they don't want to talk to this

345
00:15:20,329 --> 00:15:25,520
person I found that in especially in

346
00:15:23,899 --> 00:15:26,780
complex organizations

347
00:15:25,520 --> 00:15:28,370
if you can just find the person who owns

348
00:15:26,780 --> 00:15:31,640
risk and compliance for your business

349
00:15:28,370 --> 00:15:33,080
and take them out to lunch and ask them

350
00:15:31,640 --> 00:15:35,240
what's on their mind what's worrying

351
00:15:33,080 --> 00:15:37,340
them start a report get them involved

352
00:15:35,240 --> 00:15:39,440
it's actually the easiest path to

353
00:15:37,340 --> 00:15:43,850
determine what you really need to focus

354
00:15:39,440 --> 00:15:46,490
on and what can be saved for later it's

355
00:15:43,850 --> 00:15:54,380
a great to lunch simple it's great tool

356
00:15:46,490 --> 00:15:57,590
to get insights so you met your

357
00:15:54,380 --> 00:16:00,770
compliance officer then start with a

358
00:15:57,590 --> 00:16:02,180
persona map of your organization you

359
00:16:00,770 --> 00:16:04,160
know you've got your compliance owner

360
00:16:02,180 --> 00:16:05,599
the business owner they're concerned

361
00:16:04,160 --> 00:16:07,760
that the security strategy is aligned

362
00:16:05,600 --> 00:16:10,130
with business and compliance goals you

363
00:16:07,760 --> 00:16:12,080
got your security folks you know they

364
00:16:10,130 --> 00:16:14,090
want to have they've often been in the

365
00:16:12,080 --> 00:16:16,340
position of watching rather than doing

366
00:16:14,090 --> 00:16:20,060
they want to get involved and be able to

367
00:16:16,340 --> 00:16:22,970
help you design key controls that will

368
00:16:20,060 --> 00:16:26,329
mitigate prevalent or high-risk events

369
00:16:22,970 --> 00:16:28,670
to the business ops people often view

370
00:16:26,330 --> 00:16:30,740
audit and compliance and securities on

371
00:16:28,670 --> 00:16:35,270
plan work right so what you don't want

372
00:16:30,740 --> 00:16:37,370
to do is is come come back after a

373
00:16:35,270 --> 00:16:39,050
particular process or throw an audit at

374
00:16:37,370 --> 00:16:40,850
someone and they're like oh man now this

375
00:16:39,050 --> 00:16:42,319
is going to take two weeks out of my

376
00:16:40,850 --> 00:16:44,180
time I had all these other projects I

377
00:16:42,320 --> 00:16:45,380
needed to do my whiteboard is already

378
00:16:44,180 --> 00:16:49,250
filled and I have to do the side of

379
00:16:45,380 --> 00:16:53,680
thing they don't want they don't want to

380
00:16:49,250 --> 00:16:56,180
have you know complex audit driven

381
00:16:53,680 --> 00:16:58,489
processes that simply don't scale and

382
00:16:56,180 --> 00:17:00,319
then developers you know often don't

383
00:16:58,490 --> 00:17:02,630
think about compliance and maybe

384
00:17:00,320 --> 00:17:03,830
potentially security at all in the

385
00:17:02,630 --> 00:17:04,880
development process they're just trying

386
00:17:03,830 --> 00:17:05,900
to get the feature out the door because

387
00:17:04,880 --> 00:17:07,880
that's what they're being measured

388
00:17:05,900 --> 00:17:10,100
against so you just want to make sure

389
00:17:07,880 --> 00:17:14,290
that whatever workflow you're putting in

390
00:17:10,099 --> 00:17:14,290
place isn't going to impact their flow

391
00:17:16,089 --> 00:17:20,389
so the more difficult it is to enforce

392
00:17:19,130 --> 00:17:21,860
policy across all these different

393
00:17:20,390 --> 00:17:23,990
stakeholders the more different

394
00:17:21,859 --> 00:17:24,889
difficult it will be to meet your audit

395
00:17:23,990 --> 00:17:31,250
and regulatory and compliance

396
00:17:24,890 --> 00:17:33,080
requirements and then finally you know

397
00:17:31,250 --> 00:17:34,970
for developers particularly there's

398
00:17:33,080 --> 00:17:36,679
always this pull toward you know the

399
00:17:34,970 --> 00:17:37,940
next new thing what's the next new thing

400
00:17:36,680 --> 00:17:39,140
that's going to help us build a great

401
00:17:37,940 --> 00:17:41,210
software product what

402
00:17:39,140 --> 00:17:43,130
next new thing that's going to help my

403
00:17:41,210 --> 00:17:45,620
career as a developer and you know I

404
00:17:43,130 --> 00:17:48,710
remember when my engineers were like hey

405
00:17:45,620 --> 00:17:51,679
let's all do go you know I yeah that's

406
00:17:48,710 --> 00:17:53,330
great you know but we're also where you

407
00:17:51,680 --> 00:17:55,340
know we also need to be able to ensure

408
00:17:53,330 --> 00:17:57,830
that we're securing whatever whatever

409
00:17:55,340 --> 00:18:00,350
platform tools dr. Cooper Nettie's they

410
00:17:57,830 --> 00:18:02,480
change their mind all the time that

411
00:18:00,350 --> 00:18:04,250
they're bringing on board and so you

412
00:18:02,480 --> 00:18:06,410
know one of the things that you have to

413
00:18:04,250 --> 00:18:09,110
deal with in a sec DevOps and your

414
00:18:06,410 --> 00:18:11,600
framework is that you need to be able to

415
00:18:09,110 --> 00:18:14,149
onboard heterogeneous tools that drive

416
00:18:11,600 --> 00:18:15,800
business without creating process

417
00:18:14,150 --> 00:18:17,960
problems that prevent people from

418
00:18:15,800 --> 00:18:19,790
bringing them on so you so so the

419
00:18:17,960 --> 00:18:21,980
process of certifying applications for

420
00:18:19,790 --> 00:18:23,570
deployment for example in large complex

421
00:18:21,980 --> 00:18:25,670
organizations can often be a very kind

422
00:18:23,570 --> 00:18:26,810
of ham driven process well how are you

423
00:18:25,670 --> 00:18:28,400
going to do that when you've got lots of

424
00:18:26,810 --> 00:18:30,679
new tools coming on board all the time

425
00:18:28,400 --> 00:18:32,840
right what we're trying to do is create

426
00:18:30,680 --> 00:18:35,840
strategies that work across the business

427
00:18:32,840 --> 00:18:38,209
done anticipate future tooling that

428
00:18:35,840 --> 00:18:40,220
people can will be wanting to bring on

429
00:18:38,210 --> 00:18:41,690
that don't also cause a bottleneck or a

430
00:18:40,220 --> 00:18:45,440
people based process that slows

431
00:18:41,690 --> 00:18:46,550
everything down because what you don't

432
00:18:45,440 --> 00:18:49,760
want to end up with is organizational

433
00:18:46,550 --> 00:18:51,950
strife right you you can end up in these

434
00:18:49,760 --> 00:18:54,110
situations where the security people

435
00:18:51,950 --> 00:18:57,140
become sort of the Department of know

436
00:18:54,110 --> 00:18:58,760
and the operations people say well we're

437
00:18:57,140 --> 00:18:59,990
not even going to try that because it's

438
00:18:58,760 --> 00:19:01,460
just going to fail and we're not going

439
00:18:59,990 --> 00:19:02,900
to get it done and the projects can not

440
00:19:01,460 --> 00:19:04,850
going to go anywhere and then the

441
00:19:02,900 --> 00:19:06,770
developers feel frustrated right like

442
00:19:04,850 --> 00:19:08,719
you see this tension going on inside of

443
00:19:06,770 --> 00:19:10,700
instances all the time kind of a

444
00:19:08,720 --> 00:19:13,250
defeatist attitude toward security and

445
00:19:10,700 --> 00:19:15,050
compliance whereas if you get everybody

446
00:19:13,250 --> 00:19:16,640
together at the beginning you find out

447
00:19:15,050 --> 00:19:18,980
where the hut where the hot-button

448
00:19:16,640 --> 00:19:20,660
issues are hot topics and then you work

449
00:19:18,980 --> 00:19:22,280
toward essentially something that

450
00:19:20,660 --> 00:19:26,290
everybody can find acceptable because

451
00:19:22,280 --> 00:19:29,830
ultimately this is all about risk and

452
00:19:26,290 --> 00:19:32,710
finding balance between security

453
00:19:29,830 --> 00:19:38,870
compliance the business goals and

454
00:19:32,710 --> 00:19:40,310
procedures you know most security and

455
00:19:38,870 --> 00:19:42,739
compliance people have this sort of

456
00:19:40,310 --> 00:19:44,600
knee-jerk reaction which is absolutist

457
00:19:42,740 --> 00:19:46,820
right it's either safe or it's not safe

458
00:19:44,600 --> 00:19:48,679
or I can figure out a scenario in which

459
00:19:46,820 --> 00:19:50,899
whatever the control is that you've put

460
00:19:48,680 --> 00:19:53,539
in place can be exploited but sometimes

461
00:19:50,900 --> 00:19:55,129
perfect is the enemy of the good

462
00:19:53,539 --> 00:19:57,499
right so you want to be able to make

463
00:19:55,129 --> 00:20:01,998
incremental improvements that will help

464
00:19:57,499 --> 00:20:04,279
your business feel safer and that is

465
00:20:01,999 --> 00:20:06,080
sort of you know and given that the

466
00:20:04,279 --> 00:20:07,489
landscape of security is kind of

467
00:20:06,080 --> 00:20:09,590
ever-changing that's just a reality

468
00:20:07,489 --> 00:20:12,259
there is no perfect solution anymore

469
00:20:09,590 --> 00:20:14,418
what you can do is identify what's high

470
00:20:12,259 --> 00:20:19,729
value and start working on that as a

471
00:20:14,419 --> 00:20:22,369
group so when you go and meet your

472
00:20:19,729 --> 00:20:26,989
security people they're just going to

473
00:20:22,369 --> 00:20:28,908
blab all these acronyms various controls

474
00:20:26,989 --> 00:20:29,929
etc at you and it's going to feel like

475
00:20:28,909 --> 00:20:33,109
you're listening to a foreign language

476
00:20:29,929 --> 00:20:34,970
and you know when we think about these

477
00:20:33,109 --> 00:20:37,189
standards we often talk about them and

478
00:20:34,970 --> 00:20:39,139
it's like one name right we're stuck you

479
00:20:37,190 --> 00:20:41,599
know stopped to compliant we are you

480
00:20:39,139 --> 00:20:44,209
know we've done I so we are HIPAA

481
00:20:41,599 --> 00:20:46,249
compliant or do we use NIST but it's

482
00:20:44,210 --> 00:20:49,249
actually this like cascading tree of

483
00:20:46,249 --> 00:20:50,779
stuff to do and operations security

484
00:20:49,249 --> 00:20:52,849
people look at this it's like oh my gosh

485
00:20:50,779 --> 00:20:56,929
it's going to fill up my whiteboard um

486
00:20:52,849 --> 00:20:59,389
and so you know what happens as many

487
00:20:56,929 --> 00:21:01,340
otakon compliance controls that we put

488
00:20:59,389 --> 00:21:03,408
in as operators and as security people

489
00:21:01,340 --> 00:21:04,668
kind of come from a bottom up like you

490
00:21:03,409 --> 00:21:06,679
you know you see this one thing it says

491
00:21:04,669 --> 00:21:08,960
oh well I need to control or rotate my

492
00:21:06,679 --> 00:21:10,580
credentials every 30 days so then you

493
00:21:08,960 --> 00:21:12,200
start with this like technical solution

494
00:21:10,580 --> 00:21:14,199
to this one thing but you haven't

495
00:21:12,200 --> 00:21:17,450
created a process that sort of drives

496
00:21:14,200 --> 00:21:19,879
you know drives a greater security goals

497
00:21:17,450 --> 00:21:21,349
and so that it ends up becoming this

498
00:21:19,879 --> 00:21:24,109
kind of like never-ending list of stuff

499
00:21:21,349 --> 00:21:25,129
to do but it's an opportunity so when

500
00:21:24,109 --> 00:21:26,658
you're faced with something like this

501
00:21:25,129 --> 00:21:28,279
it's actually an opportunity to go back

502
00:21:26,659 --> 00:21:29,749
to the business and say what kind of

503
00:21:28,279 --> 00:21:31,609
processes are we looking to put in place

504
00:21:29,749 --> 00:21:33,859
what kind of behaviors are we looking to

505
00:21:31,609 --> 00:21:36,139
change what is ultimately the goal of

506
00:21:33,859 --> 00:21:37,759
being able to control something like

507
00:21:36,139 --> 00:21:40,488
this is it to be able to accelerate

508
00:21:37,759 --> 00:21:42,950
adoption of new technology is it going

509
00:21:40,489 --> 00:21:44,269
to be to um you know deliver more

510
00:21:42,950 --> 00:21:47,090
business value through faster deployment

511
00:21:44,269 --> 00:21:49,179
how can we change the process so that

512
00:21:47,090 --> 00:21:52,399
we're not just tackling the technical

513
00:21:49,179 --> 00:21:56,149
spec of any one issue but creating an

514
00:21:52,399 --> 00:21:58,309
organization that actually has is

515
00:21:56,149 --> 00:22:01,129
compliant and is working towards

516
00:21:58,309 --> 00:22:03,049
mitigating risk so this is where you

517
00:22:01,129 --> 00:22:04,668
start to bring the you know DevOps is

518
00:22:03,049 --> 00:22:06,980
all about working together about

519
00:22:04,669 --> 00:22:08,179
collaboration about fast flow you start

520
00:22:06,980 --> 00:22:11,059
bringing the compliance and security

521
00:22:08,179 --> 00:22:15,860
people into that fast flow and that and

522
00:22:11,059 --> 00:22:17,149
that will help mitigate risk so just to

523
00:22:15,860 --> 00:22:20,270
sit just that drive that point further

524
00:22:17,150 --> 00:22:21,500
technology serves behavior the

525
00:22:20,270 --> 00:22:22,730
technology isn't the solution but

526
00:22:21,500 --> 00:22:23,900
everybody's knee-jerk reaction is I'm

527
00:22:22,730 --> 00:22:24,830
just going to go buy something to fix

528
00:22:23,900 --> 00:22:27,530
that problem because they told me I

529
00:22:24,830 --> 00:22:30,010
needed to have two factor auth that's

530
00:22:27,530 --> 00:22:33,710
not the way to go it's really more about

531
00:22:30,010 --> 00:22:35,120
trying to drive behavior and what you

532
00:22:33,710 --> 00:22:36,740
want to do is you want to be able to

533
00:22:35,120 --> 00:22:38,629
categorize your risk by severity and

534
00:22:36,740 --> 00:22:40,429
prevalence right what's a high

535
00:22:38,630 --> 00:22:42,470
prevalence you know it's very common to

536
00:22:40,429 --> 00:22:44,419
get a splinter do we have public service

537
00:22:42,470 --> 00:22:45,860
announcements for splinters no we do

538
00:22:44,419 --> 00:22:47,510
have public service announcements for

539
00:22:45,860 --> 00:22:49,699
cigarette smoking because you have much

540
00:22:47,510 --> 00:22:51,080
more severe outcomes so do some sort of

541
00:22:49,700 --> 00:22:53,450
risk calculation inside your

542
00:22:51,080 --> 00:22:57,530
organization to figure out what you want

543
00:22:53,450 --> 00:22:59,630
to focus on so common threat actions are

544
00:22:57,530 --> 00:23:02,540
often in scope so for example access

545
00:22:59,630 --> 00:23:05,270
control issues are calm are really

546
00:23:02,540 --> 00:23:07,460
common in most breaches these are often

547
00:23:05,270 --> 00:23:08,780
usually inside of a regulatory scope so

548
00:23:07,460 --> 00:23:11,870
it's definitely something you need to

549
00:23:08,780 --> 00:23:14,120
think about step three is to describe

550
00:23:11,870 --> 00:23:16,459
the risk and the proposed mitigation so

551
00:23:14,120 --> 00:23:18,229
if you're doing regular review of access

552
00:23:16,460 --> 00:23:19,970
credentials you have to talk with your

553
00:23:18,230 --> 00:23:22,460
business owners about what they feel are

554
00:23:19,970 --> 00:23:24,140
reasonable intervals they might say once

555
00:23:22,460 --> 00:23:25,340
quarter they might say you need to

556
00:23:24,140 --> 00:23:28,780
rotate them every day because we're

557
00:23:25,340 --> 00:23:28,780
constantly under attack by the Chinese

558
00:23:32,320 --> 00:23:37,100
so then if you can run your control

559
00:23:35,150 --> 00:23:38,540
through the system right is the tool

560
00:23:37,100 --> 00:23:39,918
that you built or the process that you

561
00:23:38,540 --> 00:23:42,409
want or the behavior you're trying to

562
00:23:39,919 --> 00:23:48,110
achieve can get through this system you

563
00:23:42,410 --> 00:23:50,059
can automate it so one of the things you

564
00:23:48,110 --> 00:23:51,530
want to do is pick tools that work that

565
00:23:50,059 --> 00:23:54,080
don't walk you into one floor provider

566
00:23:51,530 --> 00:23:58,639
and businesses are always more on the

567
00:23:54,080 --> 00:24:00,770
way and then automate the process or not

568
00:23:58,640 --> 00:24:02,630
there are some things you may find are

569
00:24:00,770 --> 00:24:05,120
so sensitive that you really can only

570
00:24:02,630 --> 00:24:08,870
ever do that process through some sort

571
00:24:05,120 --> 00:24:10,549
of manual event like a ticket there are

572
00:24:08,870 --> 00:24:12,439
some things like provisioning you know

573
00:24:10,549 --> 00:24:14,030
if you're working in a very highly

574
00:24:12,440 --> 00:24:15,169
compliant environment you want to give

575
00:24:14,030 --> 00:24:18,980
someone access to the database

576
00:24:15,169 --> 00:24:20,600
credential it may always be a one one

577
00:24:18,980 --> 00:24:22,310
ticket one person case

578
00:24:20,600 --> 00:24:24,889
sometimes you can actually automate it

579
00:24:22,310 --> 00:24:26,360
to provide gating functions continuous

580
00:24:24,890 --> 00:24:28,070
logging of activities be able to make

581
00:24:26,360 --> 00:24:33,850
dashboards and sort of show things at

582
00:24:28,070 --> 00:24:36,230
scale then you need to test it right

583
00:24:33,850 --> 00:24:37,719
continuum security i think is downstairs

584
00:24:36,230 --> 00:24:41,420
they use behavior driven development

585
00:24:37,720 --> 00:24:44,720
processes to be to demonstrate various

586
00:24:41,420 --> 00:24:46,430
kinds of concerti controls and you know

587
00:24:44,720 --> 00:24:47,660
teams that focus on testing early they

588
00:24:46,430 --> 00:24:48,920
have better results from a security

589
00:24:47,660 --> 00:24:50,510
perspective which means you're going to

590
00:24:48,920 --> 00:24:52,220
do better in an audit which means you're

591
00:24:50,510 --> 00:24:59,480
going to be more compliant and less have

592
00:24:52,220 --> 00:25:01,310
less risk in your business um so the

593
00:24:59,480 --> 00:25:04,310
last step which is really the most

594
00:25:01,310 --> 00:25:05,480
important is actually to talk take

595
00:25:04,310 --> 00:25:07,190
everything that you've done and

596
00:25:05,480 --> 00:25:08,930
everything you've controlled in all of

597
00:25:07,190 --> 00:25:11,870
your processes back to the business and

598
00:25:08,930 --> 00:25:14,420
tell them and inform them about how

599
00:25:11,870 --> 00:25:16,570
you're managing risk dumping JSON on

600
00:25:14,420 --> 00:25:19,630
someone's desk probably not informative

601
00:25:16,570 --> 00:25:23,270
maybe coming up with some sort of

602
00:25:19,630 --> 00:25:25,220
example workflow or or dashboard or

603
00:25:23,270 --> 00:25:27,139
another kind of tool that might overlay

604
00:25:25,220 --> 00:25:32,660
this would be much more informative to a

605
00:25:27,140 --> 00:25:36,800
business person finally I have a website

606
00:25:32,660 --> 00:25:38,750
Tim factor see I com it has a school or

607
00:25:36,800 --> 00:25:40,490
in a checklist for securing your

608
00:25:38,750 --> 00:25:42,380
continuous development pipeline it's

609
00:25:40,490 --> 00:25:44,960
open source project we'd love to have

610
00:25:42,380 --> 00:25:50,960
contributions so feel free to check it

611
00:25:44,960 --> 00:25:53,000
out so Jean Kim says who's the author of

612
00:25:50,960 --> 00:25:55,160
the DevOps audit defense kit along with

613
00:25:53,000 --> 00:25:56,390
others talks about how instead of

614
00:25:55,160 --> 00:25:57,860
spending our time trying to create the

615
00:25:56,390 --> 00:25:59,570
perfect system that never fails let's

616
00:25:57,860 --> 00:26:01,610
instead create systems that are designed

617
00:25:59,570 --> 00:26:03,919
so we can detect problems early and fix

618
00:26:01,610 --> 00:26:08,449
the fast and that's really part of the

619
00:26:03,920 --> 00:26:09,590
goal of the ten factor CI job website so

620
00:26:08,450 --> 00:26:13,490
once you've automated everything you can

621
00:26:09,590 --> 00:26:16,939
go home right well there's always more

622
00:26:13,490 --> 00:26:18,530
so really you're trying to move through

623
00:26:16,940 --> 00:26:22,430
processes to make it increasingly

624
00:26:18,530 --> 00:26:24,530
automated this is where you know kind of

625
00:26:22,430 --> 00:26:26,810
security planning process that cetera

626
00:26:24,530 --> 00:26:28,060
gets you toward the repeatable adaptable

627
00:26:26,810 --> 00:26:31,340
security controls that are ultimately

628
00:26:28,060 --> 00:26:32,510
the goal for anyone who's got a real

629
00:26:31,340 --> 00:26:34,899
risk they need to deal with in their

630
00:26:32,510 --> 00:26:34,900
business

631
00:26:34,940 --> 00:26:41,190
so what happens after that so you've

632
00:26:37,230 --> 00:26:43,890
automated everything the robots are now

633
00:26:41,190 --> 00:26:46,530
controlling the robots what's next so

634
00:26:43,890 --> 00:26:49,200
for me things I like to think about that

635
00:26:46,530 --> 00:26:51,360
a rather forward-looking are I OT and

636
00:26:49,200 --> 00:26:53,700
machine identity I mean think about this

637
00:26:51,360 --> 00:26:55,350
if you work in a bank you could have

638
00:26:53,700 --> 00:26:58,350
potentially a chat bot talking to

639
00:26:55,350 --> 00:27:00,270
another chat bot right so what does that

640
00:26:58,350 --> 00:27:01,740
mean what we just got the people in

641
00:27:00,270 --> 00:27:03,389
business unit a who weren't supposed to

642
00:27:01,740 --> 00:27:05,730
talk to business users be because of

643
00:27:03,390 --> 00:27:08,520
compliance reasons you know locked down

644
00:27:05,730 --> 00:27:10,380
from you know from people chat now I've

645
00:27:08,520 --> 00:27:11,580
got BOTS chatting BOTS like how does

646
00:27:10,380 --> 00:27:13,440
that going to work so this is these

647
00:27:11,580 --> 00:27:17,100
these types of security controls are

648
00:27:13,440 --> 00:27:19,740
just getting more and more complicated

649
00:27:17,100 --> 00:27:22,320
and faster moving and I think this is a

650
00:27:19,740 --> 00:27:24,600
really interesting area to to start to

651
00:27:22,320 --> 00:27:26,600
think about things and then finally one

652
00:27:24,600 --> 00:27:29,909
other thing that I often think about and

653
00:27:26,600 --> 00:27:31,620
write about is AIS and access control

654
00:27:29,910 --> 00:27:33,690
there's an awful huge opportunity for

655
00:27:31,620 --> 00:27:36,570
machine learning to help us understand

656
00:27:33,690 --> 00:27:39,690
better behavior and patterns of behavior

657
00:27:36,570 --> 00:27:41,610
in automated systems I think what we're

658
00:27:39,690 --> 00:27:43,590
talking about ultimately is still just

659
00:27:41,610 --> 00:27:46,320
robotics and automation when we have

660
00:27:43,590 --> 00:27:48,120
realize that can actually make decisions

661
00:27:46,320 --> 00:27:49,080
and that's code writing code I think

662
00:27:48,120 --> 00:27:50,729
that's going to be incredibly

663
00:27:49,080 --> 00:27:54,510
interesting security an access control

664
00:27:50,730 --> 00:27:55,770
problem so that's the I think it's

665
00:27:54,510 --> 00:27:57,540
theirs I think we're just at the

666
00:27:55,770 --> 00:27:59,430
beginning of starting to figure out how

667
00:27:57,540 --> 00:28:01,290
we're going to map automation and

668
00:27:59,430 --> 00:28:05,250
security practice to these to these

669
00:28:01,290 --> 00:28:08,129
fast-moving machines so with that I'll

670
00:28:05,250 --> 00:28:10,580
say thank you and ask if you have any

671
00:28:08,130 --> 00:28:10,580
questions

672
00:28:25,430 --> 00:28:43,350
afraid to talk to the compliance person

673
00:28:27,630 --> 00:28:45,240
huh yes one two yes I'm sorry I couldn't

674
00:28:43,350 --> 00:28:55,020
hear the last thing you said something

675
00:28:45,240 --> 00:28:56,580
and then scale so yeah I could really

676
00:28:55,020 --> 00:29:00,330
agree on the fact that everybody should

677
00:28:56,580 --> 00:29:03,830
talk together sachdeva knobs and

678
00:29:00,330 --> 00:29:09,270
compliance and compliance yes it's great

679
00:29:03,830 --> 00:29:12,870
at with small teams how'd you do that at

680
00:29:09,270 --> 00:29:15,150
big scale so really you know this is

681
00:29:12,870 --> 00:29:18,000
about breaking down specific activities

682
00:29:15,150 --> 00:29:21,090
and dysfunctional groups right so if you

683
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:23,250
have a big scale team embedding security

684
00:29:21,090 --> 00:29:26,010
ISM is a direction that companies are

685
00:29:23,250 --> 00:29:28,020
taking toward taking a person in

686
00:29:26,010 --> 00:29:29,910
embedding them a nap you know app dev

687
00:29:28,020 --> 00:29:32,340
group as the security and compliance

688
00:29:29,910 --> 00:29:34,590
liaison back to a sort of central group

689
00:29:32,340 --> 00:29:37,919
if you can come up with a way of

690
00:29:34,590 --> 00:29:39,360
distributing authority like that central

691
00:29:37,920 --> 00:29:41,220
training distributed Authority and

692
00:29:39,360 --> 00:29:44,669
enforcement that actually scales out

693
00:29:41,220 --> 00:29:46,860
really nicely in large businesses thank

694
00:29:44,670 --> 00:29:48,240
you target does this for example after

695
00:29:46,860 --> 00:29:50,610
their breach they did a huge

696
00:29:48,240 --> 00:29:54,390
organizational overhaul whereby they

697
00:29:50,610 --> 00:29:57,570
have now embedded security experts who

698
00:29:54,390 --> 00:30:01,650
who are well trained in pci which is the

699
00:29:57,570 --> 00:30:03,210
nature of their compliance strategy for

700
00:30:01,650 --> 00:30:05,790
all of their business units not just the

701
00:30:03,210 --> 00:30:07,260
pci compliant groups they've embedded

702
00:30:05,790 --> 00:30:09,480
security and compliance people right

703
00:30:07,260 --> 00:30:11,700
into the app app team and only when they

704
00:30:09,480 --> 00:30:13,500
have a question or feel that they need

705
00:30:11,700 --> 00:30:15,180
to have an aberration or an exception

706
00:30:13,500 --> 00:30:20,180
from the policy do they go back to the

707
00:30:15,180 --> 00:30:20,180
central authority yes

708
00:30:24,260 --> 00:30:30,570
so the question is how do you assign

709
00:30:28,140 --> 00:30:32,940
responsibility for the risks that are

710
00:30:30,570 --> 00:30:35,429
being accepted so I totally agree with

711
00:30:32,940 --> 00:30:36,870
the idea that in and I'm from my body

712
00:30:35,430 --> 00:30:38,730
upset kind of the development side of

713
00:30:36,870 --> 00:30:40,439
things so I believe that we can't be the

714
00:30:38,730 --> 00:30:42,300
part of no I can assure beat the power

715
00:30:40,440 --> 00:30:44,040
of yes so I like the idea of pollution

716
00:30:42,300 --> 00:30:45,360
and we say hey here are the side effects

717
00:30:44,040 --> 00:30:46,379
of what you're doing so we don't say

718
00:30:45,360 --> 00:30:48,389
don't do that i would just say hey

719
00:30:46,380 --> 00:30:50,520
there's a couple rows here some are

720
00:30:48,390 --> 00:30:51,720
worse or better than others how do you

721
00:30:50,520 --> 00:30:54,090
capture that how do you make people

722
00:30:51,720 --> 00:30:56,370
accountable so that we can say yes but

723
00:30:54,090 --> 00:30:58,320
there's a direct connection between the

724
00:30:56,370 --> 00:30:59,760
decisions being made so this is again

725
00:30:58,320 --> 00:31:02,909
where you need to and I mean I think

726
00:30:59,760 --> 00:31:04,260
that the the ultimate risk lies with the

727
00:31:02,910 --> 00:31:06,410
business owners right it could be your

728
00:31:04,260 --> 00:31:09,120
CFO it could be your CEO whomever it is

729
00:31:06,410 --> 00:31:10,800
this under speak able to understand and

730
00:31:09,120 --> 00:31:13,139
communicate out of a kind of coded

731
00:31:10,800 --> 00:31:15,090
system and into business language is i

732
00:31:13,140 --> 00:31:17,190
think it's a it's a gap that we're all

733
00:31:15,090 --> 00:31:18,689
trying to sort of transit because

734
00:31:17,190 --> 00:31:21,120
turning things into business terms is

735
00:31:18,690 --> 00:31:23,360
not something that devops a knapsack are

736
00:31:21,120 --> 00:31:26,250
necessarily very good at doing right now

737
00:31:23,360 --> 00:31:27,719
so you know when we talk about this you

738
00:31:26,250 --> 00:31:29,910
kind of have to frame it up in terms of

739
00:31:27,720 --> 00:31:32,010
like a public health event right so i

740
00:31:29,910 --> 00:31:35,280
think president obama was talking about

741
00:31:32,010 --> 00:31:37,110
in Wired magazine about a eyes right you

742
00:31:35,280 --> 00:31:39,240
don't want to build big walls to prevent

743
00:31:37,110 --> 00:31:41,310
people from innovating but you also need

744
00:31:39,240 --> 00:31:43,200
to look and see where the risks start to

745
00:31:41,310 --> 00:31:45,870
occur how great they could potentially

746
00:31:43,200 --> 00:31:47,400
be and so you don't want to have a

747
00:31:45,870 --> 00:31:49,260
scenario where the business doesn't

748
00:31:47,400 --> 00:31:51,360
understand the risks that you're taking

749
00:31:49,260 --> 00:31:53,910
right or if you have I mean there's

750
00:31:51,360 --> 00:31:58,100
accountability and then there's also the

751
00:31:53,910 --> 00:32:02,040
need to move fast and and you know

752
00:31:58,100 --> 00:32:03,389
deliver value make money etc so turning

753
00:32:02,040 --> 00:32:04,830
this all into business terms is

754
00:32:03,390 --> 00:32:06,030
something that we I think there's a lot

755
00:32:04,830 --> 00:32:08,189
of products that are starting to come to

756
00:32:06,030 --> 00:32:09,510
market to try and do that essentially

757
00:32:08,190 --> 00:32:11,280
say hey you know this is what our

758
00:32:09,510 --> 00:32:13,110
infrastructure looks like these are thus

759
00:32:11,280 --> 00:32:14,700
these are the things I think we all need

760
00:32:13,110 --> 00:32:18,500
to be paying attention to these are the

761
00:32:14,700 --> 00:32:18,500
things we view as lower risk

762
00:32:20,899 --> 00:32:24,649
Thank You Isabelle sorry unfortunately

763
00:32:22,249 --> 00:32:27,039
I've got just oh yeah here thank you so

764
00:32:24,649 --> 00:32:27,039
much everyone
