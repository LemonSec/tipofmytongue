1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,450
good afternoon everyone hope you enjoy

2
00:00:03,720 --> 00:00:08,010
the lunch time so security in the wild

3
00:00:06,450 --> 00:00:10,679
secret in wild will be a talk about

4
00:00:08,010 --> 00:00:13,049
security perceptions around the software

5
00:00:10,679 --> 00:00:15,990
out so i'm working on a software house

6
00:00:13,049 --> 00:00:19,289
and we work our way to put security in

7
00:00:15,990 --> 00:00:21,060
the process you know in this talk i will

8
00:00:19,289 --> 00:00:22,920
try to show you some tricks that we use

9
00:00:21,060 --> 00:00:29,098
and some of them work some of them not

10
00:00:22,920 --> 00:00:31,679
so first of all who am i I'm working as

11
00:00:29,099 --> 00:00:34,500
a security architect for blip blip is a

12
00:00:31,679 --> 00:00:36,379
poor to buy his company in Portugal that

13
00:00:34,500 --> 00:00:39,210
belongs to Paddy Power betfair group

14
00:00:36,380 --> 00:00:42,270
most of my work is on the gambling and

15
00:00:39,210 --> 00:00:46,230
betting industry nowadays meta I'm a

16
00:00:42,270 --> 00:00:48,780
security gig so in Porto I run a group

17
00:00:46,230 --> 00:00:52,050
of enthusiastic of security where we do

18
00:00:48,780 --> 00:00:54,030
some meetups and I am curator of up

19
00:00:52,050 --> 00:00:56,578
sakis and maybe some of you know it

20
00:00:54,030 --> 00:01:01,350
somewhat don't that you can use it for

21
00:00:56,579 --> 00:01:03,359
security awareness in your company the

22
00:01:01,350 --> 00:01:06,720
agenda will be pretty straightforward so

23
00:01:03,359 --> 00:01:09,270
we will start to see some some of the

24
00:01:06,720 --> 00:01:10,979
things we we know that exist in the

25
00:01:09,270 --> 00:01:14,640
world the world I'm seeing is the

26
00:01:10,979 --> 00:01:18,960
software world are we facing and what we

27
00:01:14,640 --> 00:01:23,670
do to survival the world as we know it

28
00:01:18,960 --> 00:01:26,789
so we have one thing normally if we work

29
00:01:23,670 --> 00:01:29,070
on the software house we have always

30
00:01:26,790 --> 00:01:32,009
this demand for new features the our

31
00:01:29,070 --> 00:01:34,770
product team wants to be always ahead of

32
00:01:32,009 --> 00:01:36,600
the game of the others you know so it's

33
00:01:34,770 --> 00:01:38,280
like feature feature feature and time to

34
00:01:36,600 --> 00:01:41,130
market is everything and that's for a

35
00:01:38,280 --> 00:01:43,950
security perspective is a problem new

36
00:01:41,130 --> 00:01:46,470
technologies hypes so what I'm talking

37
00:01:43,950 --> 00:01:48,979
about I work with several geeks that

38
00:01:46,470 --> 00:01:51,479
they really love the new technology and

39
00:01:48,979 --> 00:01:53,670
everything that is new most of the times

40
00:01:51,479 --> 00:01:55,590
for them is better than the last one

41
00:01:53,670 --> 00:01:57,899
they used and they want to change and

42
00:01:55,590 --> 00:02:00,000
for a security team to keep up their

43
00:01:57,899 --> 00:02:02,009
pace is really really hard because I

44
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:05,610
remember some years ago when they start

45
00:02:02,009 --> 00:02:08,429
to do the change for no GS I didn't know

46
00:02:05,610 --> 00:02:11,340
anything about JavaScript and no GS so

47
00:02:08,429 --> 00:02:13,590
how can I teach them security problems

48
00:02:11,340 --> 00:02:18,150
if I don't I don't know

49
00:02:13,590 --> 00:02:21,510
which problems I'm facing it so we have

50
00:02:18,150 --> 00:02:24,120
the technology wife for sure this starts

51
00:02:21,510 --> 00:02:27,540
a notion time of of time so all of us

52
00:02:24,120 --> 00:02:30,450
work on pretty complex companies and we

53
00:02:27,540 --> 00:02:31,859
have a huge stack and this stock I'm

54
00:02:30,450 --> 00:02:35,690
talking about is not the software stack

55
00:02:31,860 --> 00:02:38,340
I'm talking about directors managers

56
00:02:35,690 --> 00:02:41,099
adults and people that have a completely

57
00:02:38,340 --> 00:02:45,120
different time notion from the real one

58
00:02:41,099 --> 00:02:47,760
so when we are under in the interval the

59
00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:50,849
battlefield let's call this people want

60
00:02:47,760 --> 00:02:54,120
to do things that are impossible we knew

61
00:02:50,849 --> 00:02:58,379
we need to work out better the better

62
00:02:54,120 --> 00:03:01,799
way we know so a new issues arise every

63
00:02:58,379 --> 00:03:04,200
day infosec worldly the ongoing world

64
00:03:01,799 --> 00:03:06,180
and as we know if there is a new

65
00:03:04,200 --> 00:03:08,339
technology new problems will arise and

66
00:03:06,180 --> 00:03:11,400
even in the wall technology that are for

67
00:03:08,340 --> 00:03:13,500
a while in the being using productions

68
00:03:11,400 --> 00:03:17,370
we know that people do more research so

69
00:03:13,500 --> 00:03:19,079
problems will be will appear and one

70
00:03:17,370 --> 00:03:22,260
thing that is common to everything

71
00:03:19,079 --> 00:03:23,700
inside the companies the companies the

72
00:03:22,260 --> 00:03:25,888
company I work and for sure in yours

73
00:03:23,700 --> 00:03:28,858
probably is that security is not part of

74
00:03:25,889 --> 00:03:31,139
the process there is no specific thing

75
00:03:28,859 --> 00:03:33,030
just to talk with the security guy or

76
00:03:31,139 --> 00:03:34,650
make sure that security is aware or

77
00:03:33,030 --> 00:03:36,989
something like that security is always

78
00:03:34,650 --> 00:03:39,150
something that they want but they will

79
00:03:36,989 --> 00:03:41,160
they will not enforce their toward they

80
00:03:39,150 --> 00:03:45,660
will not work to be part of the process

81
00:03:41,160 --> 00:03:51,269
and facing the world so I work in a

82
00:03:45,660 --> 00:03:52,889
software house so the most important

83
00:03:51,269 --> 00:03:55,470
things they do it's the software and

84
00:03:52,889 --> 00:03:58,019
this is a normal diagram of the software

85
00:03:55,470 --> 00:03:59,609
development lifecycle probably in your

86
00:03:58,019 --> 00:04:02,910
company you have something similar you

87
00:03:59,609 --> 00:04:05,370
can be different for sure in this one

88
00:04:02,910 --> 00:04:10,139
this is more or less approach we have

89
00:04:05,370 --> 00:04:11,970
inside lip and one just simple notice as

90
00:04:10,139 --> 00:04:13,739
the deployment part we had the

91
00:04:11,970 --> 00:04:16,918
deployment as keeping the product in

92
00:04:13,739 --> 00:04:19,139
production and maintenance so some some

93
00:04:16,918 --> 00:04:21,539
people put this is a different thing but

94
00:04:19,139 --> 00:04:26,430
here it's just we put on the same box

95
00:04:21,539 --> 00:04:29,159
and let's get started so requirement

96
00:04:26,430 --> 00:04:30,750
here it's where people do the question

97
00:04:29,160 --> 00:04:34,380
so I want to build a new product what

98
00:04:30,750 --> 00:04:37,259
for who will use the system how the

99
00:04:34,380 --> 00:04:41,610
system will be used which input we need

100
00:04:37,259 --> 00:04:43,289
in which output will be generated and in

101
00:04:41,610 --> 00:04:46,500
the end we hope to have a nice

102
00:04:43,289 --> 00:04:49,620
requirement specification document this

103
00:04:46,500 --> 00:04:51,060
is not the real life but somehow because

104
00:04:49,620 --> 00:04:52,889
people sometimes do the requirement from

105
00:04:51,060 --> 00:04:56,190
a whiteboard and they will not write any

106
00:04:52,889 --> 00:04:59,520
any documentation about it but this is

107
00:04:56,190 --> 00:05:01,469
what we would like to have and looking

108
00:04:59,520 --> 00:05:03,359
in detail so most of the times

109
00:05:01,470 --> 00:05:05,250
requirements to the product that we are

110
00:05:03,360 --> 00:05:07,470
maintaining are coming from the product

111
00:05:05,250 --> 00:05:09,990
team and they have a security perception

112
00:05:07,470 --> 00:05:12,419
bodies security they have no clue what

113
00:05:09,990 --> 00:05:14,190
is security so one thing the guys are

114
00:05:12,419 --> 00:05:16,680
not bad but most of the time they really

115
00:05:14,190 --> 00:05:18,539
don't know that what they are suggesting

116
00:05:16,680 --> 00:05:22,410
it will open a huge hole in our

117
00:05:18,539 --> 00:05:26,250
organization so what we try to do a she

118
00:05:22,410 --> 00:05:28,560
or two to do to to avoid this problem it

119
00:05:26,250 --> 00:05:31,349
was some kind of an engagement process

120
00:05:28,560 --> 00:05:34,560
where we can we try to fulfill a simple

121
00:05:31,349 --> 00:05:37,560
document with them where we will take to

122
00:05:34,560 --> 00:05:39,419
a meeting and take that meeting will be

123
00:05:37,560 --> 00:05:41,669
full of all Security department's

124
00:05:39,419 --> 00:05:46,680
infrastructure risk compliance all that

125
00:05:41,669 --> 00:05:48,948
kind of security guys where we will

126
00:05:46,680 --> 00:05:51,960
present this project and if someone

127
00:05:48,949 --> 00:05:54,449
writes a question like this is compliant

128
00:05:51,960 --> 00:05:57,409
on some jurisdiction maybe it will have

129
00:05:54,449 --> 00:05:59,970
a note to work on that project and

130
00:05:57,409 --> 00:06:02,460
improvements for this engagement process

131
00:05:59,970 --> 00:06:05,639
it's more or less okay we can try to get

132
00:06:02,460 --> 00:06:08,638
the product on the early stage and make

133
00:06:05,639 --> 00:06:10,949
the security group aware of it but we

134
00:06:08,639 --> 00:06:13,020
need to do better and target training

135
00:06:10,949 --> 00:06:15,840
because education in my perspective is

136
00:06:13,020 --> 00:06:17,400
the key for everything we we should try

137
00:06:15,840 --> 00:06:20,099
to educate the product owners with

138
00:06:17,400 --> 00:06:22,710
target training we should show them a

139
00:06:20,099 --> 00:06:25,680
bad example stuff that they ask for in a

140
00:06:22,710 --> 00:06:28,289
went really bad and stuff that they ask

141
00:06:25,680 --> 00:06:30,570
for security work in went really well so

142
00:06:28,289 --> 00:06:34,099
if they saw the examples probably they

143
00:06:30,570 --> 00:06:37,680
will have a different approach next time

144
00:06:34,099 --> 00:06:39,360
then we go to the design phase so here

145
00:06:37,680 --> 00:06:41,669
is the techie part

146
00:06:39,360 --> 00:06:45,860
people will gather will do the art where

147
00:06:41,669 --> 00:06:49,799
software requirement systems they will

148
00:06:45,860 --> 00:06:51,360
draw there they're nice diagrams saying

149
00:06:49,800 --> 00:06:53,129
this system will interact with this

150
00:06:51,360 --> 00:06:57,870
system the elections this type of data

151
00:06:53,129 --> 00:07:00,509
and very security probably not there but

152
00:06:57,870 --> 00:07:02,550
we will see in a minute and in the end

153
00:07:00,509 --> 00:07:04,139
we hope to have implementation and a

154
00:07:02,550 --> 00:07:08,400
support documentation something that we

155
00:07:04,139 --> 00:07:11,280
can get to the dev teams and for them

156
00:07:08,400 --> 00:07:13,318
they know of what to do again this is

157
00:07:11,280 --> 00:07:17,520
not real life something that we would

158
00:07:13,319 --> 00:07:19,620
like to have and in the design so most

159
00:07:17,520 --> 00:07:21,779
of the work on design it's made by

160
00:07:19,620 --> 00:07:23,520
architecture teams and the security

161
00:07:21,779 --> 00:07:25,430
perspective for them is like security is

162
00:07:23,520 --> 00:07:27,448
always a blocker these guys they want

163
00:07:25,430 --> 00:07:29,699
ssl they will blow up my performance

164
00:07:27,449 --> 00:07:33,090
these guys want authentication this is

165
00:07:29,699 --> 00:07:37,590
really hard to do it's their way to see

166
00:07:33,090 --> 00:07:41,219
things and what we did is a security

167
00:07:37,590 --> 00:07:42,779
group to to tackle this problem we

168
00:07:41,219 --> 00:07:44,969
create a security architecture team that

169
00:07:42,779 --> 00:07:46,740
I belong to where we try to be on their

170
00:07:44,969 --> 00:07:49,319
meetings and show show them that is not

171
00:07:46,740 --> 00:07:52,589
so bad that things can happen on a

172
00:07:49,319 --> 00:07:54,690
secure way and on a simple way it's

173
00:07:52,589 --> 00:07:57,659
better to tackle the problems right now

174
00:07:54,690 --> 00:07:59,610
then in the after the developer is done

175
00:07:57,659 --> 00:08:02,759
because it will be more costly for the

176
00:07:59,610 --> 00:08:04,919
company for sure and improvements again

177
00:08:02,759 --> 00:08:08,099
education we show that we should show

178
00:08:04,919 --> 00:08:11,219
them the good examples from facebook

179
00:08:08,099 --> 00:08:13,550
google amazon and so on we should show

180
00:08:11,219 --> 00:08:15,960
them that is possible to have secured

181
00:08:13,550 --> 00:08:19,430
secure stuff built in on the nice

182
00:08:15,960 --> 00:08:22,229
software stock if out being performance

183
00:08:19,430 --> 00:08:26,430
having performance losses or if out

184
00:08:22,229 --> 00:08:30,000
being so heavy and then we go to the

185
00:08:26,430 --> 00:08:32,549
code the code it's where where I do most

186
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:34,620
of my work it's with the dev teams and

187
00:08:32,549 --> 00:08:37,409
what is supposed to be on this fight

188
00:08:34,620 --> 00:08:39,240
they have diagrams they have

189
00:08:37,409 --> 00:08:40,828
documentation to work out but at least

190
00:08:39,240 --> 00:08:44,820
they have one thing for sure they know

191
00:08:40,828 --> 00:08:49,040
what they need to build n is on this

192
00:08:44,820 --> 00:08:51,360
face where we create a real product and

193
00:08:49,040 --> 00:08:52,860
who are the responsible for the code

194
00:08:51,360 --> 00:08:55,350
development teams

195
00:08:52,860 --> 00:08:57,720
security perception is don't care most

196
00:08:55,350 --> 00:08:59,370
of them some of them again they don't

197
00:08:57,720 --> 00:09:00,630
know what is security so that's the

198
00:08:59,370 --> 00:09:02,339
reason they don't care others they

199
00:09:00,630 --> 00:09:03,959
really just don't care they know about

200
00:09:02,339 --> 00:09:06,089
the problems but they don't want to fix

201
00:09:03,959 --> 00:09:07,949
it but we have a mission we should

202
00:09:06,089 --> 00:09:13,440
implement security in our development

203
00:09:07,950 --> 00:09:16,680
lifecycle so first thing we did was give

204
00:09:13,440 --> 00:09:19,410
them security libraries libraries so we

205
00:09:16,680 --> 00:09:21,329
have in OSP srp API and stuff like that

206
00:09:19,410 --> 00:09:24,300
for the Java projects where they do a

207
00:09:21,329 --> 00:09:27,029
bunch of validations and we create more

208
00:09:24,300 --> 00:09:29,010
in our security libraries where we say

209
00:09:27,029 --> 00:09:31,890
to the guys a please can you use this

210
00:09:29,010 --> 00:09:33,930
version of the input validation because

211
00:09:31,890 --> 00:09:37,019
it's safe and for you with just calling

212
00:09:33,930 --> 00:09:40,050
a different method and the guys are they

213
00:09:37,019 --> 00:09:43,860
are really okay with this approach then

214
00:09:40,050 --> 00:09:50,910
bleep works in a scram he use cramp to

215
00:09:43,860 --> 00:09:52,740
to develop software and in spam the they

216
00:09:50,910 --> 00:09:54,089
work on Sprint's of two weeks and they

217
00:09:52,740 --> 00:09:55,500
have something called at the sprint

218
00:09:54,089 --> 00:09:56,880
planning where they decide what they

219
00:09:55,500 --> 00:09:59,339
will do that sprint and they will give

220
00:09:56,880 --> 00:10:01,829
points for user stories and one thing

221
00:09:59,339 --> 00:10:03,510
that security team has problems in the

222
00:10:01,829 --> 00:10:06,560
past was communication with the dev so

223
00:10:03,510 --> 00:10:08,970
with this project watchdog we managed to

224
00:10:06,560 --> 00:10:11,099
to talk with the dev teams almost on a

225
00:10:08,970 --> 00:10:12,540
seamless way so in the past i use

226
00:10:11,100 --> 00:10:15,060
raleigh right right now they are using

227
00:10:12,540 --> 00:10:17,370
target process anyway II just a child

228
00:10:15,060 --> 00:10:20,279
platform for managing the u.s. defects

229
00:10:17,370 --> 00:10:23,339
and all that stuff and we just add a

230
00:10:20,279 --> 00:10:25,199
simple security review check on every

231
00:10:23,339 --> 00:10:26,910
single user story so when they are doing

232
00:10:25,199 --> 00:10:29,250
their sprint planning they can just

233
00:10:26,910 --> 00:10:31,800
check that user story as a security

234
00:10:29,250 --> 00:10:34,199
review and write some note saying hey

235
00:10:31,800 --> 00:10:36,209
guys can you have a look on this or we

236
00:10:34,199 --> 00:10:38,550
are we will follow this path do you

237
00:10:36,209 --> 00:10:40,949
think it's okay so on a seamless way on

238
00:10:38,550 --> 00:10:44,490
a normal thing that they do every single

239
00:10:40,949 --> 00:10:46,469
every single two weeks they can interact

240
00:10:44,490 --> 00:10:49,230
with the security team they will not

241
00:10:46,470 --> 00:10:52,160
suffer it will be it's pretty easy for

242
00:10:49,230 --> 00:10:55,500
them then we recreate the shekel and

243
00:10:52,160 --> 00:10:58,019
what is shackled is just a simple web

244
00:10:55,500 --> 00:11:00,329
book but it works really really well so

245
00:10:58,019 --> 00:11:03,779
every single time that the guy do commit

246
00:11:00,329 --> 00:11:06,449
to master it will put it all the that

247
00:11:03,779 --> 00:11:07,230
commits part will be parsed by a regular

248
00:11:06,449 --> 00:11:10,040
expression

249
00:11:07,230 --> 00:11:14,160
engine that will try to catch vulnerable

250
00:11:10,040 --> 00:11:17,069
calls so an example we are the guys in

251
00:11:14,160 --> 00:11:18,930
Java do request parameters that's okay

252
00:11:17,070 --> 00:11:21,750
but we have a security library that you

253
00:11:18,930 --> 00:11:23,699
can just do request safe parameters and

254
00:11:21,750 --> 00:11:25,320
it will validate all the inputs against

255
00:11:23,700 --> 00:11:27,750
the bad things that we don't wander in

256
00:11:25,320 --> 00:11:30,480
our product and this check old is

257
00:11:27,750 --> 00:11:32,850
automatic just dropping an email to the

258
00:11:30,480 --> 00:11:34,500
guy a man I saw your comet can you just

259
00:11:32,850 --> 00:11:36,450
please change your call for this call

260
00:11:34,500 --> 00:11:37,830
and everything will be okay and the guys

261
00:11:36,450 --> 00:11:40,050
really freaked out because they thought

262
00:11:37,830 --> 00:11:42,390
that we are on them on the top of for

263
00:11:40,050 --> 00:11:44,280
every single comment to the master but

264
00:11:42,390 --> 00:11:45,990
really works well and we just need to

265
00:11:44,280 --> 00:11:48,660
apply to regular expression engine and

266
00:11:45,990 --> 00:11:50,820
add more rules as we like in is really

267
00:11:48,660 --> 00:11:53,910
really simple so it was a nice approach

268
00:11:50,820 --> 00:11:55,470
to to tackle this big problem and then I

269
00:11:53,910 --> 00:11:57,030
have on the separate boxes because

270
00:11:55,470 --> 00:12:00,330
testing and called will share these

271
00:11:57,030 --> 00:12:02,339
boxes we have other approach so as I

272
00:12:00,330 --> 00:12:05,220
said they work on Sprint's of two weeks

273
00:12:02,340 --> 00:12:07,800
so we have a meeting that is called

274
00:12:05,220 --> 00:12:09,630
security clinics where we gather all the

275
00:12:07,800 --> 00:12:12,270
security champions guys that I didn't

276
00:12:09,630 --> 00:12:15,780
talk about I will talk in a bit where

277
00:12:12,270 --> 00:12:17,880
they will show me what they will do for

278
00:12:15,780 --> 00:12:20,160
this print and if they have any security

279
00:12:17,880 --> 00:12:22,200
concern or most of the times they don't

280
00:12:20,160 --> 00:12:24,480
have but I shell into them with

281
00:12:22,200 --> 00:12:27,330
questions I asked them did you thought

282
00:12:24,480 --> 00:12:29,730
about this are you sure this is not

283
00:12:27,330 --> 00:12:32,550
vulnerable to some kind of this type of

284
00:12:29,730 --> 00:12:34,470
attacks and the guy starts to think up

285
00:12:32,550 --> 00:12:37,349
during that meeting and it's a good

286
00:12:34,470 --> 00:12:39,300
thing because since it's all across the

287
00:12:37,350 --> 00:12:42,420
company different teams know what other

288
00:12:39,300 --> 00:12:44,819
teams are doing then we have security in

289
00:12:42,420 --> 00:12:46,530
scram again we are using scram and they

290
00:12:44,820 --> 00:12:49,350
have a thing that is called definition

291
00:12:46,530 --> 00:12:52,350
of then and where this definition of

292
00:12:49,350 --> 00:12:54,690
then they just say this is the things

293
00:12:52,350 --> 00:12:57,150
that I want to mark this user story as

294
00:12:54,690 --> 00:12:59,430
complete so why not put security there

295
00:12:57,150 --> 00:13:01,890
so that was our approach we went there

296
00:12:59,430 --> 00:13:04,920
and give them we talked with them first

297
00:13:01,890 --> 00:13:07,920
of course and realize that with we get

298
00:13:04,920 --> 00:13:09,810
if we give them a checklist for them to

299
00:13:07,920 --> 00:13:13,349
validate if I doing input validation

300
00:13:09,810 --> 00:13:15,989
output validation least privilege is

301
00:13:13,350 --> 00:13:18,720
being used and so on and so on they like

302
00:13:15,990 --> 00:13:20,790
it and it's really easy for them so this

303
00:13:18,720 --> 00:13:22,020
is a project security in scram just

304
00:13:20,790 --> 00:13:24,240
doing something marked to their

305
00:13:22,020 --> 00:13:25,860
completion of them and then we have the

306
00:13:24,240 --> 00:13:28,110
security champions program security

307
00:13:25,860 --> 00:13:31,980
champions program is where we put a

308
00:13:28,110 --> 00:13:34,530
normal deaf guy that is keen on security

309
00:13:31,980 --> 00:13:37,320
or just like the infosec world and we

310
00:13:34,530 --> 00:13:38,699
try to teach them we teach them to look

311
00:13:37,320 --> 00:13:40,800
to the user stories from a new

312
00:13:38,700 --> 00:13:43,770
perspective we teach them out to do an

313
00:13:40,800 --> 00:13:45,719
attack on a fancy way and we have events

314
00:13:43,770 --> 00:13:49,050
events where we do a small conference

315
00:13:45,720 --> 00:13:50,820
internal where people go from other

316
00:13:49,050 --> 00:13:53,670
parts of the company we show them

317
00:13:50,820 --> 00:13:55,980
security as a whole and try to teach

318
00:13:53,670 --> 00:13:57,300
them something new in their area in the

319
00:13:55,980 --> 00:13:59,400
end of the day they have a capture the

320
00:13:57,300 --> 00:14:02,430
flag where they will put their hands on

321
00:13:59,400 --> 00:14:03,660
the on the vulnerabilities and they

322
00:14:02,430 --> 00:14:06,630
really enjoy that because they are

323
00:14:03,660 --> 00:14:09,030
really learning then we have static

324
00:14:06,630 --> 00:14:10,890
analysis of course the static and all

325
00:14:09,030 --> 00:14:14,310
this is a helper for the vertical we

326
00:14:10,890 --> 00:14:15,990
have a pipeline in place and if anything

327
00:14:14,310 --> 00:14:17,579
was the first time we approach the

328
00:14:15,990 --> 00:14:18,990
DevOps guy saying hey can we put the

329
00:14:17,580 --> 00:14:22,620
static analogy in the pipeline their

330
00:14:18,990 --> 00:14:24,390
answer was no they just say it runs

331
00:14:22,620 --> 00:14:29,100
under one minute innocent of course not

332
00:14:24,390 --> 00:14:31,650
so no okay so let's try to reach middle

333
00:14:29,100 --> 00:14:33,540
point here so can we have some kind of a

334
00:14:31,650 --> 00:14:36,780
synchronous call here and they said no

335
00:14:33,540 --> 00:14:39,180
again if they are okay why not and it's

336
00:14:36,780 --> 00:14:40,439
against their philosophy and I say the

337
00:14:39,180 --> 00:14:43,020
continuous integration philosophy and I

338
00:14:40,440 --> 00:14:45,120
said but anyway it will really improve

339
00:14:43,020 --> 00:14:46,530
our security and we managed to have

340
00:14:45,120 --> 00:14:49,830
anything projects call so they have the

341
00:14:46,530 --> 00:14:53,430
normal pipeline and then when their main

342
00:14:49,830 --> 00:14:54,840
job is green the build one it will

343
00:14:53,430 --> 00:14:57,420
trigger a downstream project that will

344
00:14:54,840 --> 00:15:00,360
be our static analysis and with this

345
00:14:57,420 --> 00:15:03,660
thing we managed to get results for

346
00:15:00,360 --> 00:15:06,120
built after not in one minute but after

347
00:15:03,660 --> 00:15:10,050
five six ten depends off the platform we

348
00:15:06,120 --> 00:15:11,670
are analyzing in their dashboard they

349
00:15:10,050 --> 00:15:13,979
have a special dash world where they see

350
00:15:11,670 --> 00:15:15,599
the the steps of the pipeline and then

351
00:15:13,980 --> 00:15:17,520
they have this a nice security column

352
00:15:15,600 --> 00:15:19,260
when they can Co the static analysis I'd

353
00:15:17,520 --> 00:15:21,780
we have one vulnerability for this build

354
00:15:19,260 --> 00:15:24,240
but we didn't have previous so something

355
00:15:21,780 --> 00:15:26,339
we should have add the vulnerability

356
00:15:24,240 --> 00:15:29,220
problem there and they will check it out

357
00:15:26,340 --> 00:15:33,139
and for static and always too we just

358
00:15:29,220 --> 00:15:35,029
use the normals check marks 45

359
00:15:33,139 --> 00:15:38,299
there is always pays for improvement and

360
00:15:35,029 --> 00:15:40,759
again training we try to do it on our

361
00:15:38,299 --> 00:15:43,879
security champions in security clinics

362
00:15:40,759 --> 00:15:47,509
trying to give pneus give them the tools

363
00:15:43,879 --> 00:15:50,239
for awareness posters always talk about

364
00:15:47,509 --> 00:15:52,970
the governor abilities and the upside

365
00:15:50,239 --> 00:15:54,709
design stuff like that and of course we

366
00:15:52,970 --> 00:15:56,959
can do more we can do more security

367
00:15:54,709 --> 00:16:02,508
libraries for them because it will be a

368
00:15:56,959 --> 00:16:06,349
helper in a easy one for them then we

369
00:16:02,509 --> 00:16:08,480
have testing so they did the they did

370
00:16:06,350 --> 00:16:10,519
the code and then they go for the

371
00:16:08,480 --> 00:16:13,879
testing phase and we will do the product

372
00:16:10,519 --> 00:16:16,220
validation two types of testing here QA

373
00:16:13,879 --> 00:16:18,079
teams so most of the times are

374
00:16:16,220 --> 00:16:19,779
responsible for the the part of the

375
00:16:18,079 --> 00:16:21,618
testing of the product and the

376
00:16:19,779 --> 00:16:23,089
perception is the same as the goal

377
00:16:21,619 --> 00:16:25,429
because normally they are coders but

378
00:16:23,089 --> 00:16:28,970
they do more testing so they don't care

379
00:16:25,429 --> 00:16:30,619
and our response was doing dynamic

380
00:16:28,970 --> 00:16:32,209
testing of course we take the product

381
00:16:30,619 --> 00:16:35,239
that they want to put in production and

382
00:16:32,209 --> 00:16:38,628
we will test test it so we have

383
00:16:35,239 --> 00:16:41,269
specialized teams on that and they share

384
00:16:38,629 --> 00:16:43,610
the same common things security clinics

385
00:16:41,269 --> 00:16:45,889
Eugene screams that can be security

386
00:16:43,610 --> 00:16:49,819
champions and Static analysts can help

387
00:16:45,889 --> 00:16:52,089
them to fix a problem before go live so

388
00:16:49,819 --> 00:16:54,829
as improvement one more time training

389
00:16:52,089 --> 00:16:57,410
awareness and regression testing this is

390
00:16:54,829 --> 00:16:59,988
really important Security's need to be

391
00:16:57,410 --> 00:17:02,719
there so if we found a bug in production

392
00:16:59,989 --> 00:17:05,839
it we don't want that back to be again

393
00:17:02,720 --> 00:17:07,490
we should help them recreate that bug on

394
00:17:05,839 --> 00:17:11,480
their regression testing so they will

395
00:17:07,490 --> 00:17:13,909
put that on there automatic tests and it

396
00:17:11,480 --> 00:17:15,470
will catch if something go wrong I'm

397
00:17:13,909 --> 00:17:17,779
saying this is an improvement because

398
00:17:15,470 --> 00:17:19,250
it's not so easy because we most of the

399
00:17:17,779 --> 00:17:20,539
times in the security team you don't

400
00:17:19,250 --> 00:17:23,359
know how to interact with their

401
00:17:20,539 --> 00:17:26,029
frameworks for testing sometimes so we

402
00:17:23,359 --> 00:17:28,039
need their cooperation for this part but

403
00:17:26,029 --> 00:17:32,529
no doubt that would be a huge

404
00:17:28,039 --> 00:17:36,408
improvement if we manage to do this and

405
00:17:32,529 --> 00:17:38,269
then we go for the deployment part so

406
00:17:36,409 --> 00:17:40,610
you have a nice build every single test

407
00:17:38,269 --> 00:17:43,669
was passed hopefully and then the

408
00:17:40,610 --> 00:17:44,959
Prophet the product go go live most of

409
00:17:43,669 --> 00:17:46,980
the times dev ops teams are there

410
00:17:44,960 --> 00:17:48,330
responsible what is their perception for

411
00:17:46,980 --> 00:17:50,640
security everything is then I don't

412
00:17:48,330 --> 00:17:54,480
don't need to do anything because

413
00:17:50,640 --> 00:17:56,610
everything is it was already thought so

414
00:17:54,480 --> 00:17:59,070
what we did in our security team to help

415
00:17:56,610 --> 00:18:00,990
these guys so we have some are learning

416
00:17:59,070 --> 00:18:03,689
strategies I'm calling we have a web

417
00:18:00,990 --> 00:18:06,090
product so we have security others we

418
00:18:03,690 --> 00:18:07,679
try to implement resource integrity in

419
00:18:06,090 --> 00:18:11,459
the things that we are loading from CD

420
00:18:07,679 --> 00:18:14,700
ends of try to enforce HTTPS when

421
00:18:11,460 --> 00:18:17,460
possible unfortunately not always and we

422
00:18:14,700 --> 00:18:19,500
did the nice thing that was right now we

423
00:18:17,460 --> 00:18:22,020
are able to test in production so we can

424
00:18:19,500 --> 00:18:25,470
do the same thing as an attacker so this

425
00:18:22,020 --> 00:18:30,210
is our responsibility and as a side note

426
00:18:25,470 --> 00:18:32,400
we are not the security team in the past

427
00:18:30,210 --> 00:18:35,880
have a lot of struggles doing some code

428
00:18:32,400 --> 00:18:37,650
reviews during the development phase and

429
00:18:35,880 --> 00:18:39,350
when they want to go live security team

430
00:18:37,650 --> 00:18:43,169
was responsible for doing code reviews

431
00:18:39,350 --> 00:18:46,320
but we saw that was impossible so we we

432
00:18:43,169 --> 00:18:48,840
reach reach out a solution that is the

433
00:18:46,320 --> 00:18:51,210
risk by solution what were we are

434
00:18:48,840 --> 00:18:53,570
talking about so in the end for the guys

435
00:18:51,210 --> 00:18:56,580
there in port that want to do a build

436
00:18:53,570 --> 00:18:58,470
they will have a decision-making helper

437
00:18:56,580 --> 00:19:00,840
for them to know if that build is

438
00:18:58,470 --> 00:19:02,880
secured or not but based on risk so we

439
00:19:00,840 --> 00:19:04,620
thought we reach out the DMS in the

440
00:19:02,880 --> 00:19:06,210
product owners about their different

441
00:19:04,620 --> 00:19:09,418
product in s what was the default

442
00:19:06,210 --> 00:19:11,010
parameters for their software like the

443
00:19:09,419 --> 00:19:15,600
number of user stories into production

444
00:19:11,010 --> 00:19:19,049
the it handles PCA its and OPI I data or

445
00:19:15,600 --> 00:19:21,000
not it's pci and with that we managed to

446
00:19:19,049 --> 00:19:23,610
put on an equation that will generate a

447
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:28,200
number and we can put this as a green

448
00:19:23,610 --> 00:19:30,360
yellow or red and that will small colors

449
00:19:28,200 --> 00:19:31,950
will appear on their dashboard the

450
00:19:30,360 --> 00:19:34,590
pipeline dashboard on the security

451
00:19:31,950 --> 00:19:37,380
column and it will help them try to have

452
00:19:34,590 --> 00:19:39,270
a nice decision before go live so

453
00:19:37,380 --> 00:19:41,280
probably feeds it's red something is

454
00:19:39,270 --> 00:19:43,679
wrong in you should check it out if it's

455
00:19:41,280 --> 00:19:45,210
yellow something is out of normal and

456
00:19:43,679 --> 00:19:47,370
probably you should check it out if it's

457
00:19:45,210 --> 00:19:49,260
green it's just one more normal build it

458
00:19:47,370 --> 00:19:52,049
will not tell you that it's safe or

459
00:19:49,260 --> 00:19:56,129
secure but at least they know what they

460
00:19:52,049 --> 00:19:59,129
are putting in production and we can do

461
00:19:56,130 --> 00:20:00,840
better of course and we can do if we are

462
00:19:59,130 --> 00:20:02,880
major enough a bug bounty

463
00:20:00,840 --> 00:20:05,309
program why not that we need to be

464
00:20:02,880 --> 00:20:07,830
mature enough to open to the world and

465
00:20:05,309 --> 00:20:09,510
give money to people to catch bugs and

466
00:20:07,830 --> 00:20:11,399
monitoring place so we have a sorry

467
00:20:09,510 --> 00:20:13,980
teams we have a lot of monitoring but

468
00:20:11,400 --> 00:20:16,080
anyway security wise we can do where we

469
00:20:13,980 --> 00:20:19,289
can try to monitoring their logs try to

470
00:20:16,080 --> 00:20:20,850
take in advance attacks that can be

471
00:20:19,289 --> 00:20:23,010
happening no one is noticing because

472
00:20:20,850 --> 00:20:25,559
they are just exploiting logical flaws

473
00:20:23,010 --> 00:20:29,460
and stuff like that so monetary it's for

474
00:20:25,559 --> 00:20:32,760
sure an improvement and in the end what

475
00:20:29,460 --> 00:20:34,279
we reach was this is the aspect of our

476
00:20:32,760 --> 00:20:36,990
secure software development lifecycle

477
00:20:34,279 --> 00:20:40,710
with some notes that i didn't put there

478
00:20:36,990 --> 00:20:43,470
like the risk calculator and other auto

479
00:20:40,710 --> 00:20:45,570
auto things that we have but pretty much

480
00:20:43,470 --> 00:20:47,880
we have an engagement process then we

481
00:20:45,570 --> 00:20:50,520
will pass for a security architecture

482
00:20:47,880 --> 00:20:52,649
team during the code files we have

483
00:20:50,520 --> 00:20:54,840
several meeting several initiatives and

484
00:20:52,649 --> 00:20:56,489
we give them some tools for they work

485
00:20:54,840 --> 00:20:58,649
and interact with the security team

486
00:20:56,490 --> 00:21:00,809
seamless thought being boring or

487
00:20:58,649 --> 00:21:03,149
difficult then we will have dynamic

488
00:21:00,809 --> 00:21:05,789
testing and in the final stage will have

489
00:21:03,149 --> 00:21:10,229
earning and try to again test more

490
00:21:05,789 --> 00:21:13,679
because problems will appear and this

491
00:21:10,230 --> 00:21:35,460
was my presentation for today so i'm

492
00:21:13,679 --> 00:21:39,750
open for the Q&A so security team is

493
00:21:35,460 --> 00:21:46,350
huge but OPSEC more focus on apps egg i

494
00:21:39,750 --> 00:21:48,149
would say 12 12 guys probably how many

495
00:21:46,350 --> 00:21:56,279
developers that's a good question i

496
00:21:48,149 --> 00:21:58,320
would say 700 okay it's we need the

497
00:21:56,279 --> 00:22:01,440
automation for sure we need tools to

498
00:21:58,320 --> 00:22:04,799
help us otherwise we cannot do a proper

499
00:22:01,440 --> 00:22:09,049
work with the best way is try to teach

500
00:22:04,799 --> 00:22:09,049
them and give them the tools to work out

501
00:22:14,129 --> 00:22:25,899
okay if I certify the security champions

502
00:22:17,909 --> 00:22:36,960
but in peace all they make it sorry I

503
00:22:25,899 --> 00:22:36,959
didn't understand sacrifice them ah

504
00:22:38,100 --> 00:22:46,840
sorry sorry okay sorry no so on the

505
00:22:45,190 --> 00:22:48,759
securityq lineage we try to try them

506
00:22:46,840 --> 00:22:50,408
show them the cool stuff you know we can

507
00:22:48,759 --> 00:22:52,899
take a bug bounty from google and say

508
00:22:50,409 --> 00:22:56,139
hey guys see this stupid thing they did

509
00:22:52,899 --> 00:22:58,570
it they are Google do you want to be the

510
00:22:56,139 --> 00:23:01,120
same no we want to be better or equal as

511
00:22:58,570 --> 00:23:03,158
them you know so they will they like

512
00:23:01,120 --> 00:23:05,590
they like they really love their product

513
00:23:03,159 --> 00:23:09,990
so they don't want to be ashamed in

514
00:23:05,590 --> 00:23:13,000
public to fit something bad you know so

515
00:23:09,990 --> 00:23:15,399
that's the way we try to do and always

516
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:17,830
right to reach their level so when I

517
00:23:15,399 --> 00:23:19,360
don't know something i will ask them can

518
00:23:17,830 --> 00:23:21,699
you teach me this and they will feel

519
00:23:19,360 --> 00:23:23,799
like oh I know more than this guy and

520
00:23:21,700 --> 00:23:26,590
yes you know it's your product you know

521
00:23:23,799 --> 00:23:31,269
a lot more than then the from the

522
00:23:26,590 --> 00:23:33,668
product and me so it's there is no key

523
00:23:31,269 --> 00:23:35,320
for that it just be humble and try to

524
00:23:33,669 --> 00:23:36,970
reach them did you get them any training

525
00:23:35,320 --> 00:23:39,700
or anything that they can do it to spare

526
00:23:36,970 --> 00:23:41,889
to work we the training seats internal

527
00:23:39,700 --> 00:23:43,389
we try on the security champions we try

528
00:23:41,889 --> 00:23:46,209
to give them the talk directly to

529
00:23:43,389 --> 00:23:49,570
problems that we are facing and the

530
00:23:46,210 --> 00:23:51,429
mitigations in our CTFs normally they

531
00:23:49,570 --> 00:23:52,960
are they try to tackle problems that

532
00:23:51,429 --> 00:23:55,389
they can find in their own products

533
00:23:52,960 --> 00:23:57,519
that's the best training it's like a i

534
00:23:55,389 --> 00:23:59,979
take this code snippet from them and i

535
00:23:57,519 --> 00:24:05,279
did some vulnerable application around

536
00:23:59,980 --> 00:24:05,279
and they will exploit their own code so

537
00:24:07,690 --> 00:24:12,220
on the architecture team when we have

538
00:24:09,909 --> 00:24:16,480
the earlier stage you can do the threat

539
00:24:12,220 --> 00:24:18,820
modeling there you can do it I don't

540
00:24:16,480 --> 00:24:20,710
know why the you're not doing that's

541
00:24:18,820 --> 00:24:22,779
what that's for my coffee why are not

542
00:24:20,710 --> 00:24:25,149
doing threat modeling in your knapsack

543
00:24:22,779 --> 00:24:27,250
pipeline no no we are doing on the

544
00:24:25,149 --> 00:24:29,080
security architecture team it's just not

545
00:24:27,250 --> 00:24:31,360
a specific thing it's something that

546
00:24:29,080 --> 00:24:33,039
when you are a discussion the new

547
00:24:31,360 --> 00:24:35,408
product we can do the threat modeling

548
00:24:33,039 --> 00:24:37,600
with architecture team and show them

549
00:24:35,409 --> 00:24:40,480
that so you can have your threats with

550
00:24:37,600 --> 00:24:43,090
the security countermeasure men's or a

551
00:24:40,480 --> 00:24:45,549
secret impacts do you have any tracking

552
00:24:43,090 --> 00:24:48,178
of your security and security

553
00:24:45,549 --> 00:24:51,158
requirements or anything like that

554
00:24:48,179 --> 00:24:55,600
recommendations not really documentation

555
00:24:51,159 --> 00:24:57,909
like what are the attack patterns you

556
00:24:55,600 --> 00:24:59,799
can have for your application so you

557
00:24:57,909 --> 00:25:02,169
know threat can use a particular attack

558
00:24:59,799 --> 00:25:05,110
pattern to attack the application so do

559
00:25:02,169 --> 00:25:06,370
you do like attack modeling or anything

560
00:25:05,110 --> 00:25:09,549
like that along with the third morning

561
00:25:06,370 --> 00:25:13,029
yeah we show them we tried we see this

562
00:25:09,549 --> 00:25:14,799
the what they want to build and we will

563
00:25:13,029 --> 00:25:17,350
gather several attacks that we can

564
00:25:14,799 --> 00:25:19,840
suffer and we cannot control them the

565
00:25:17,350 --> 00:25:22,350
most known example it's always d-does if

566
00:25:19,840 --> 00:25:25,360
we cannot control that but is we are

567
00:25:22,350 --> 00:25:28,299
good enough to survive this if the heat

568
00:25:25,360 --> 00:25:30,189
is so your app sec team is doing the

569
00:25:28,299 --> 00:25:41,289
threat modeling the architecture team

570
00:25:30,190 --> 00:25:48,519
yes yes something more so 25 think it's

571
00:25:41,289 --> 00:25:52,019
okay as you have a question you talked

572
00:25:48,519 --> 00:25:55,690
about some tools for static analysis and

573
00:25:52,019 --> 00:25:59,500
from my experience these tools typically

574
00:25:55,690 --> 00:26:01,299
report many false positives how do you

575
00:25:59,500 --> 00:26:04,509
deal with those to build the trust that

576
00:26:01,299 --> 00:26:08,139
the two is actually useful in within the

577
00:26:04,509 --> 00:26:11,620
company and generally so so first of all

578
00:26:08,139 --> 00:26:13,959
we go case-by-case and then we when I'm

579
00:26:11,620 --> 00:26:16,418
cleaning up the 45 strike marks whatever

580
00:26:13,960 --> 00:26:20,830
and I see this is a potential issue I'll

581
00:26:16,419 --> 00:26:21,549
go near them and I will try to make sure

582
00:26:20,830 --> 00:26:24,908
that is

583
00:26:21,549 --> 00:26:27,100
real vulnerable so in short the false

584
00:26:24,909 --> 00:26:29,649
positives it's upsetting responsible to

585
00:26:27,100 --> 00:26:32,019
close them there is no bulletproof there

586
00:26:29,649 --> 00:26:34,719
so even though it's those tools are part

587
00:26:32,019 --> 00:26:37,210
of the pipeline as asynchronous job it's

588
00:26:34,720 --> 00:26:39,580
not really like reporting green or red

589
00:26:37,210 --> 00:26:42,879
because there would be almost always

590
00:26:39,580 --> 00:26:44,230
read right but no because they want to

591
00:26:42,879 --> 00:26:46,149
see everything Queen that's the good

592
00:26:44,230 --> 00:26:48,460
part because they want their pipeline

593
00:26:46,149 --> 00:26:50,439
playing for the greens and not for the

594
00:26:48,460 --> 00:26:52,179
Reds so when they see something wrong on

595
00:26:50,440 --> 00:26:54,249
their pipeline most of the teams of

596
00:26:52,179 --> 00:26:56,019
course it's a huge company not all of

597
00:26:54,249 --> 00:26:58,090
them work like this that some of them

598
00:26:56,019 --> 00:26:59,529
work like this and they will go to to

599
00:26:58,090 --> 00:27:01,779
the static and all this platform and

600
00:26:59,529 --> 00:27:04,779
start to say can I stress this because

601
00:27:01,779 --> 00:27:06,309
this is stupid this is a problem we will

602
00:27:04,779 --> 00:27:07,989
fix this and most of the times they

603
00:27:06,309 --> 00:27:09,489
clean their code that's awesome because

604
00:27:07,989 --> 00:27:11,350
they said this is a problem on that

605
00:27:09,489 --> 00:27:18,009
cause we will remove this on the next

606
00:27:11,350 --> 00:27:22,649
build don't worry so just okay I think

607
00:27:18,009 --> 00:27:22,649
that's it thank you for your time
