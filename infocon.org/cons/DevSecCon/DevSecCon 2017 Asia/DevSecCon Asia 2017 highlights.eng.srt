2
00:00:12,349 --> 00:00:19,349
deaf sicom is a important way for us to

3
00:00:17,029 --> 00:00:20,970
participate in the community to

4
00:00:19,349 --> 00:00:23,400
understand the best practices for

5
00:00:20,970 --> 00:00:26,038
security management we do a lot of

6
00:00:23,400 --> 00:00:28,168
DevOps we automate how we deploy our

7
00:00:26,039 --> 00:00:30,060
applications but at the same time we

8
00:00:28,169 --> 00:00:32,850
also want to built-in good security

9
00:00:30,060 --> 00:00:34,739
practices practices in our systems there

10
00:00:32,850 --> 00:00:36,830
was a talk just now it was on the chaos

11
00:00:34,740 --> 00:00:39,320
engineering which was very interesting

12
00:00:36,830 --> 00:00:42,360
we talked about like how we should

13
00:00:39,320 --> 00:00:45,330
continuously test our systems

14
00:00:42,360 --> 00:00:48,519
continuously and not wait for failure so

15
00:00:45,330 --> 00:00:51,449
that was very interesting talk

16
00:00:48,520 --> 00:00:54,600
[Music]

17
00:00:51,450 --> 00:00:57,690
my talk at Def Con was about from

18
00:00:54,600 --> 00:00:59,970
resilient to anti fragile it was a chaos

19
00:00:57,690 --> 00:01:01,620
in engineering introduction I talked

20
00:00:59,970 --> 00:01:05,069
about chaos engineering principles

21
00:01:01,620 --> 00:01:06,750
lessons learned how do you get started

22
00:01:05,069 --> 00:01:11,820
and what would be the advance principles

23
00:01:06,750 --> 00:01:14,520
that you would be using we have been for

24
00:01:11,820 --> 00:01:17,100
the longest period keeping security as a

25
00:01:14,520 --> 00:01:18,690
lot of times as an afterthought in a lot

26
00:01:17,100 --> 00:01:21,720
of in the last 30 years of technology

27
00:01:18,690 --> 00:01:23,039
deployment and I think we now need to do

28
00:01:21,720 --> 00:01:25,530
it correctly now that we have an

29
00:01:23,040 --> 00:01:26,820
opportunity to redo the entire process

30
00:01:25,530 --> 00:01:30,090
of software development and deployment

31
00:01:26,820 --> 00:01:31,470
and use we should get security in the

32
00:01:30,090 --> 00:01:33,899
middle of it so that's why I'm very

33
00:01:31,470 --> 00:01:36,030
happy to say they have SEC hops the

34
00:01:33,899 --> 00:01:37,560
second big in the middle name and so you

35
00:01:36,030 --> 00:01:39,360
know you clearly this will be always

36
00:01:37,560 --> 00:01:41,070
front and center it's not going to be

37
00:01:39,360 --> 00:01:43,649
forgotten it's not going to be added on

38
00:01:41,070 --> 00:01:45,000
as an afterthought it's a fantastic

39
00:01:43,649 --> 00:01:47,280
conference I think it's very affordable

40
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:50,850
for attendees it's a quite a good value

41
00:01:47,280 --> 00:01:52,800
conference so the attendees liked coming

42
00:01:50,850 --> 00:01:54,869
to the conference and also the contents

43
00:01:52,800 --> 00:01:56,280
excellent so that means that for us as a

44
00:01:54,869 --> 00:01:59,009
sponsor we're getting people who are the

45
00:01:56,280 --> 00:02:00,900
right sort of attendees for our product

46
00:01:59,009 --> 00:02:02,340
so it's a really good fit for us and we

47
00:02:00,900 --> 00:02:04,650
would definitely share that with other

48
00:02:02,340 --> 00:02:10,080
vendors as well

49
00:02:04,650 --> 00:02:11,640
I think it's the ability to have a more

50
00:02:10,080 --> 00:02:12,960
intimate conversation about what people

51
00:02:11,640 --> 00:02:15,440
are grappling with and how we actually

52
00:02:12,960 --> 00:02:17,220
fit into the piece not just the

53
00:02:15,440 --> 00:02:19,680
organization's but the partners that we

54
00:02:17,220 --> 00:02:21,120
use as well you don't tend to have that

55
00:02:19,680 --> 00:02:24,090
same connection with a lot of other

56
00:02:21,120 --> 00:02:26,700
large type events these things are a

57
00:02:24,090 --> 00:02:30,620
much more sort of one-on-one intimacy

58
00:02:26,700 --> 00:02:32,690
[Music]

59
00:02:30,620 --> 00:02:35,709
and it was really interesting to see the

60
00:02:32,690 --> 00:02:37,879
cross-section of security professionals

61
00:02:35,709 --> 00:02:40,730
professionals or system administrators

62
00:02:37,879 --> 00:02:43,399
and developers and there was a clear

63
00:02:40,730 --> 00:02:44,959
cross-section of those professionals in

64
00:02:43,400 --> 00:02:47,360
the room and that's great to see that

65
00:02:44,959 --> 00:02:50,480
means dead-set corn is doing its job of

66
00:02:47,360 --> 00:02:52,640
getting all those all those individuals

67
00:02:50,480 --> 00:02:55,790
together to understand how they can work

68
00:02:52,640 --> 00:03:00,349
together and collaborate for not only

69
00:02:55,790 --> 00:03:02,390
more robust code more secure code and a

70
00:03:00,349 --> 00:03:05,780
hell of a lot more code a lot quicker

71
00:03:02,390 --> 00:03:05,779
