1
00:00:04,730 --> 00:00:10,740
all right a love participation I want to

2
00:00:08,670 --> 00:00:12,660
know what you want to know I have lots

3
00:00:10,740 --> 00:00:14,219
of strong feelings in this area but if

4
00:00:12,660 --> 00:00:15,480
you're not guiding me then I might be

5
00:00:14,219 --> 00:00:17,279
leaving in a different direction that

6
00:00:15,480 --> 00:00:20,130
you want to hear so everyone raised one

7
00:00:17,279 --> 00:00:24,990
hand I don't care which one come on

8
00:00:20,130 --> 00:00:26,400
hey everybody oh wait I just want to

9
00:00:24,990 --> 00:00:28,948
know that your arms work thank you

10
00:00:26,400 --> 00:00:30,990
so when I ask questions and I don't see

11
00:00:28,949 --> 00:00:32,820
hands it's not because your arms don't

12
00:00:30,990 --> 00:00:36,390
work so how many people in the audience

13
00:00:32,820 --> 00:00:40,400
here are developers primary job

14
00:00:36,390 --> 00:00:46,650
how about security primary ok operations

15
00:00:40,400 --> 00:00:48,989
and excellent ok thank you all right so

16
00:00:46,650 --> 00:00:50,879
why am i up here again I have a lot of

17
00:00:48,989 --> 00:00:53,190
strong beliefs and strong feelings for

18
00:00:50,879 --> 00:00:56,640
Apps SEC I've been doing this for a very

19
00:00:53,190 --> 00:00:58,559
long time 25 years of developer more

20
00:00:56,640 --> 00:01:00,960
than a quarter-century that's weird to

21
00:00:58,559 --> 00:01:03,959
think about I have been the ena

22
00:01:00,960 --> 00:01:05,909
application security for 12 and during

23
00:01:03,960 --> 00:01:08,850
that time the apps tech industry really

24
00:01:05,909 --> 00:01:11,430
grew up from where it was with code

25
00:01:08,850 --> 00:01:15,119
reviews and pen tests to the more formal

26
00:01:11,430 --> 00:01:17,790
processes as a developer in a

27
00:01:15,120 --> 00:01:20,120
development leader I've also managed

28
00:01:17,790 --> 00:01:24,090
changed so taking companies from

29
00:01:20,120 --> 00:01:26,610
waterfall to agile to DevOps and from

30
00:01:24,090 --> 00:01:29,100
monolithic applications to micro service

31
00:01:26,610 --> 00:01:31,289
based applications doing that in those

32
00:01:29,100 --> 00:01:33,630
methodologies so I know quite a bit

33
00:01:31,290 --> 00:01:35,730
about the space I would love to tell you

34
00:01:33,630 --> 00:01:39,899
about this now what we're going to talk

35
00:01:35,730 --> 00:01:43,260
about is the things that I see go wrong

36
00:01:39,900 --> 00:01:45,060
so to Tanya's point before this isn't a

37
00:01:43,260 --> 00:01:47,159
negative talk I want to tell you how to

38
00:01:45,060 --> 00:01:48,450
fix these things this is kind of the

39
00:01:47,159 --> 00:01:50,220
reverse about me getting up here and

40
00:01:48,450 --> 00:01:52,770
saying here are all the best practices

41
00:01:50,220 --> 00:01:55,020
what I want to tell you about is here's

42
00:01:52,770 --> 00:01:56,729
the things if it looks like this you

43
00:01:55,020 --> 00:02:00,110
might not be doing as well as you could

44
00:01:56,729 --> 00:02:03,150
be there is opportunity for improvement

45
00:02:00,110 --> 00:02:05,700
so let's talk about impose tech vs. app

46
00:02:03,150 --> 00:02:10,080
SEC information security vs. application

47
00:02:05,700 --> 00:02:12,810
security this is what InfoSec looks like

48
00:02:10,080 --> 00:02:17,660
we spend billions of dollars as an

49
00:02:12,810 --> 00:02:21,630
industry to secure everything big moats

50
00:02:17,660 --> 00:02:23,310
high walls we can detect when they come

51
00:02:21,630 --> 00:02:26,160
in we can try to prevent them from

52
00:02:23,310 --> 00:02:28,110
coming in we spend tons of money on

53
00:02:26,160 --> 00:02:30,720
doing this and it looks pretty good

54
00:02:28,110 --> 00:02:35,459
we've done a really good job which is

55
00:02:30,720 --> 00:02:39,840
why I'll challenge Tanya's number here

56
00:02:35,459 --> 00:02:42,690
over 90% of breaches occur through some

57
00:02:39,840 --> 00:02:45,510
part of applications that's the part

58
00:02:42,690 --> 00:02:50,670
we're missing that's the part that we

59
00:02:45,510 --> 00:02:53,370
don't do well so years ago a couple

60
00:02:50,670 --> 00:02:55,109
years ago I had this thought anyone

61
00:02:53,370 --> 00:02:59,970
familiar with the Maginot Line World War

62
00:02:55,110 --> 00:03:03,239
two so after World War one France said

63
00:02:59,970 --> 00:03:06,090
you know what I'm sick of the Germans

64
00:03:03,239 --> 00:03:08,000
coming and taking us over what we're

65
00:03:06,090 --> 00:03:10,680
gonna do is we're gonna build a big wall

66
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:13,170
that sounds like Trump we're gonna build

67
00:03:10,680 --> 00:03:15,060
a big wall and we're gonna stop the

68
00:03:13,170 --> 00:03:18,988
Germans from coming in but what they did

69
00:03:15,060 --> 00:03:22,470
is they only built it partway as a

70
00:03:18,989 --> 00:03:24,930
barrier so what are the Germans do in

71
00:03:22,470 --> 00:03:28,980
World War two they didn't go through the

72
00:03:24,930 --> 00:03:31,049
wall see InfoSec they went around the

73
00:03:28,980 --> 00:03:33,720
wall where the fortifications were

74
00:03:31,049 --> 00:03:36,510
weaker they found the soft spot and they

75
00:03:33,720 --> 00:03:39,299
attacked that and there are a number of

76
00:03:36,510 --> 00:03:42,450
ways that they do that but this metaphor

77
00:03:39,299 --> 00:03:44,930
really struck me as the qualification of

78
00:03:42,450 --> 00:03:48,119
what does the app sect look like today

79
00:03:44,930 --> 00:03:49,390
we're doing it wrong and we need to make

80
00:03:48,120 --> 00:03:51,250
adjustments

81
00:03:49,390 --> 00:03:53,140
all right so let's talk about our anti

82
00:03:51,250 --> 00:03:56,770
patterns this one is brand new for me

83
00:03:53,140 --> 00:03:58,660
this is my deepest thought on the goals

84
00:03:56,770 --> 00:04:00,310
of your application security program so

85
00:03:58,660 --> 00:04:02,170
for anyone involved in application

86
00:04:00,310 --> 00:04:04,290
security what do you think is the goal

87
00:04:02,170 --> 00:04:09,119
of your application security program

88
00:04:04,290 --> 00:04:09,120
don't be afraid yes sir

89
00:04:11,550 --> 00:04:17,000
secure application

90
00:04:14,270 --> 00:04:20,320
functional ok functional application

91
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:20,320
I'll take that yes sir

92
00:04:26,590 --> 00:04:30,539
I'm sorry a little louder please

93
00:04:32,129 --> 00:04:40,259
resiliency reliability recovery I love

94
00:04:35,800 --> 00:04:40,259
that answer about our keynote

95
00:04:41,199 --> 00:04:46,300
okay so CIA okay

96
00:04:44,199 --> 00:04:48,490
all right and those are all great

97
00:04:46,300 --> 00:04:50,439
answers and this is what people think

98
00:04:48,490 --> 00:04:52,090
today so I want to challenge you I'm

99
00:04:50,439 --> 00:04:54,219
gonna take you through a couple of

100
00:04:52,090 --> 00:04:56,529
slides here and then see if your answer

101
00:04:54,219 --> 00:04:58,840
fundamentally changes because I believe

102
00:04:56,529 --> 00:05:01,569
everything that you said is true but I

103
00:04:58,840 --> 00:05:03,248
believe it is the byproduct of your

104
00:05:01,569 --> 00:05:07,719
application security program and it

105
00:05:03,249 --> 00:05:11,289
shouldn't be the goal so we'll start

106
00:05:07,719 --> 00:05:14,129
with cost from the time that we talk

107
00:05:11,289 --> 00:05:17,050
about building a piece of functionality

108
00:05:14,129 --> 00:05:18,310
we're doing requirements we're talking

109
00:05:17,050 --> 00:05:21,249
about the stories maybe we're in our

110
00:05:18,310 --> 00:05:23,889
grooming session till the time we get to

111
00:05:21,249 --> 00:05:25,770
production every single phase away from

112
00:05:23,889 --> 00:05:29,979
when the developer wrote that code

113
00:05:25,770 --> 00:05:31,330
figure about ten times more expensive so

114
00:05:29,979 --> 00:05:34,990
once it leaves their hands and it hits

115
00:05:31,330 --> 00:05:39,539
QA ten times gets into the staging maybe

116
00:05:34,990 --> 00:05:39,539
another ten production another ten times

117
00:05:40,379 --> 00:05:46,389
what about when we test when do we test

118
00:05:42,939 --> 00:05:50,919
today we test after they check the code

119
00:05:46,389 --> 00:05:53,139
in or we test the product before it goes

120
00:05:50,919 --> 00:05:55,839
to production in our staging

121
00:05:53,139 --> 00:05:58,539
environments so here I haven't met

122
00:05:55,839 --> 00:06:00,639
afford jet engine let's say I take this

123
00:05:58,539 --> 00:06:02,050
I build this jet engine I got a whole

124
00:06:00,639 --> 00:06:04,990
bunch of parts that come into my loading

125
00:06:02,050 --> 00:06:07,899
dock I throw them all together I put it

126
00:06:04,990 --> 00:06:11,050
in a test jig now we at this time by

127
00:06:07,899 --> 00:06:13,960
Tomic to this stage I've spent tens of

128
00:06:11,050 --> 00:06:15,939
thousands of man-hours I have spent

129
00:06:13,960 --> 00:06:19,180
hundreds of thousands of dollars and

130
00:06:15,939 --> 00:06:22,160
built value into this product put it the

131
00:06:19,180 --> 00:06:25,250
test rig and it blows up

132
00:06:22,160 --> 00:06:27,840
not a good outcome why did it blow up

133
00:06:25,250 --> 00:06:30,300
well in this particular case once we've

134
00:06:27,840 --> 00:06:34,080
dug down deep enough one of the fan

135
00:06:30,300 --> 00:06:39,090
blades in that jet engine had a micro

136
00:06:34,080 --> 00:06:40,440
fracture in it that you couldn't see but

137
00:06:39,090 --> 00:06:43,289
when you put it in the jet engine you

138
00:06:40,440 --> 00:06:46,430
bring it up to speed it blows up now the

139
00:06:43,290 --> 00:06:49,530
question is when should we have tested

140
00:06:46,430 --> 00:06:51,240
should we test it when we have the whole

141
00:06:49,530 --> 00:06:54,150
jet engine built or should we have

142
00:06:51,240 --> 00:06:56,100
tested that part when it came in on the

143
00:06:54,150 --> 00:06:58,409
loading dock or should the manufacturer

144
00:06:56,100 --> 00:07:02,070
that we bought it from have tested it

145
00:06:58,410 --> 00:07:05,040
prior to giving it to us you see the

146
00:07:02,070 --> 00:07:08,030
difference to fix this part let's say we

147
00:07:05,040 --> 00:07:09,870
found it out before the engine blew up

148
00:07:08,030 --> 00:07:11,789
we're gonna have to pull that whole

149
00:07:09,870 --> 00:07:15,030
engine apart it's not dissimilar to what

150
00:07:11,790 --> 00:07:18,030
we do with our applications we have to

151
00:07:15,030 --> 00:07:20,640
break things down fix it and then put

152
00:07:18,030 --> 00:07:22,409
everything back so all of the testing

153
00:07:20,640 --> 00:07:27,240
that needed to be done is now useless I

154
00:07:22,410 --> 00:07:29,280
have to retest there's a lot of waste if

155
00:07:27,240 --> 00:07:31,290
we wait till the end but that's what we

156
00:07:29,280 --> 00:07:34,820
do with applications security today we

157
00:07:31,290 --> 00:07:34,820
wait to the end and hope for the best

158
00:07:35,030 --> 00:07:40,710
all right so let's talk about a

159
00:07:37,020 --> 00:07:42,450
developer now it's an average developer

160
00:07:40,710 --> 00:07:44,370
and for every time that they sit down

161
00:07:42,450 --> 00:07:48,349
and write code they write some amount of

162
00:07:44,370 --> 00:07:51,479
flaws they create bugs it just happens

163
00:07:48,350 --> 00:07:53,729
so they've done some development and

164
00:07:51,479 --> 00:07:56,070
let's say there's a bug in there the

165
00:07:53,729 --> 00:07:59,310
cost of their development now increases

166
00:07:56,070 --> 00:08:01,349
because I need to find it I've got to

167
00:07:59,310 --> 00:08:03,450
track it now we're introducing people so

168
00:08:01,350 --> 00:08:06,919
now let's assume for the moment that we

169
00:08:03,450 --> 00:08:08,840
found it via computers but

170
00:08:06,919 --> 00:08:11,748
now I'm gonna track it that means I have

171
00:08:08,840 --> 00:08:16,039
a triage meeting with people in it cost

172
00:08:11,749 --> 00:08:18,979
goes up I need to fix it now that fix

173
00:08:16,039 --> 00:08:21,469
might be that actual developer which is

174
00:08:18,979 --> 00:08:22,699
going to be the least cost likely or I'm

175
00:08:21,469 --> 00:08:24,139
gonna give it to somebody else and if

176
00:08:22,699 --> 00:08:25,729
it's somebody else they have to get the

177
00:08:24,139 --> 00:08:27,590
context in their head of what was going

178
00:08:25,729 --> 00:08:31,340
on at that time to make an appropriate

179
00:08:27,590 --> 00:08:34,069
change then I have to retest it

180
00:08:31,340 --> 00:08:35,539
so this is like I knit the sweater I

181
00:08:34,070 --> 00:08:43,120
unknit the sweater and then I read knit

182
00:08:35,539 --> 00:08:45,980
the sweater what if I create a developer

183
00:08:43,120 --> 00:08:49,040
that doesn't write those because I'll

184
00:08:45,980 --> 00:08:51,350
tell you the OWASP top 10 the majority

185
00:08:49,040 --> 00:08:53,240
of those is just as simple if I wrote it

186
00:08:51,350 --> 00:08:59,000
this way versus that way cross-site

187
00:08:53,240 --> 00:09:02,060
scripting sequel injection using random

188
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:05,630
versus secure random it's just a choice

189
00:09:02,060 --> 00:09:08,119
when it came out of here so instead I

190
00:09:05,630 --> 00:09:10,670
teach that developer to avoid cross-site

191
00:09:08,120 --> 00:09:13,430
scripting to not code sequel injections

192
00:09:10,670 --> 00:09:15,500
and guess what happens now they develop

193
00:09:13,430 --> 00:09:18,680
and then they develop and they need to

194
00:09:15,500 --> 00:09:20,750
develop I don't incur the cost of

195
00:09:18,680 --> 00:09:23,170
finding and fixing stuff that could have

196
00:09:20,750 --> 00:09:23,170
been prevented

197
00:09:23,560 --> 00:09:31,709
so I'll ask again what do you think the

198
00:09:28,149 --> 00:09:31,709
goal of your app SEC program should be

199
00:09:32,730 --> 00:09:39,730
anyone want to hazard a guess what if we

200
00:09:37,449 --> 00:09:41,769
created secure developers what if we

201
00:09:39,730 --> 00:09:47,829
created a world where it comes out of

202
00:09:41,769 --> 00:09:49,600
here secure I type it and it's right it

203
00:09:47,829 --> 00:09:51,279
can't happen for all things and there

204
00:09:49,600 --> 00:09:53,819
will be things that leak through things

205
00:09:51,279 --> 00:09:56,709
that I will have to find via pen testing

206
00:09:53,819 --> 00:10:00,309
or some advanced means or maybe it's

207
00:09:56,709 --> 00:10:01,569
through dynamic analysis but the fact is

208
00:10:00,309 --> 00:10:05,800
a lot of these things can be prevented

209
00:10:01,569 --> 00:10:07,689
and the way we do this are some things

210
00:10:05,800 --> 00:10:10,269
that's similar to what Tonya talked

211
00:10:07,689 --> 00:10:13,149
about before first thing I need is

212
00:10:10,269 --> 00:10:14,740
measurement if I go to the doctor and he

213
00:10:13,149 --> 00:10:16,839
says hey you've got high blood pressure

214
00:10:14,740 --> 00:10:18,939
like well that sucks poke what do you

215
00:10:16,839 --> 00:10:19,809
mean I didn't see you since last year

216
00:10:18,939 --> 00:10:23,079
now you tell me I have high blood

217
00:10:19,809 --> 00:10:27,069
pressure one measurement is not

218
00:10:23,079 --> 00:10:28,660
information I can't say all he could say

219
00:10:27,069 --> 00:10:32,829
to me is I have high blood pressure now

220
00:10:28,660 --> 00:10:35,680
today he doesn't know whether or not I

221
00:10:32,829 --> 00:10:37,000
have high blood pressure maybe I you

222
00:10:35,680 --> 00:10:38,800
know went to breakfast had a plate full

223
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:42,300
of home fries you know pound of salt on

224
00:10:38,800 --> 00:10:44,378
them or I had a fight with my spouse of

225
00:10:42,300 --> 00:10:45,729
course my blood pressure is gonna be

226
00:10:44,379 --> 00:10:48,970
high but there are other things that can

227
00:10:45,730 --> 00:10:53,559
lead to that if I were to measure that

228
00:10:48,970 --> 00:10:55,449
now weekly or daily I would start to see

229
00:10:53,559 --> 00:10:57,189
do you better do worse am I getting

230
00:10:55,449 --> 00:10:58,420
better or am I getting worse do I really

231
00:10:57,189 --> 00:11:00,790
have high blood pressure or was that

232
00:10:58,420 --> 00:11:03,910
just some outlier of the time that I got

233
00:11:00,790 --> 00:11:05,110
measured you don't know unless you have

234
00:11:03,910 --> 00:11:07,829
frequent measurements so you need to

235
00:11:05,110 --> 00:11:07,829
have those in place

236
00:11:08,180 --> 00:11:14,160
take that information so Tonya started

237
00:11:11,610 --> 00:11:16,290
with give them secure development

238
00:11:14,160 --> 00:11:18,980
training if their developers totally

239
00:11:16,290 --> 00:11:21,810
agree but what I'm going to tell you is

240
00:11:18,980 --> 00:11:23,160
even finer than that they don't have a

241
00:11:21,810 --> 00:11:25,709
lot of time and you don't have a lot of

242
00:11:23,160 --> 00:11:27,060
time to give to them what if you took

243
00:11:25,710 --> 00:11:30,750
advantage of the measurements that you

244
00:11:27,060 --> 00:11:33,359
have and then gave them training on just

245
00:11:30,750 --> 00:11:34,710
one thing let's say that we have a big

246
00:11:33,360 --> 00:11:38,310
problem with sequel injection which

247
00:11:34,710 --> 00:11:40,080
would be a shock to me let's say I had

248
00:11:38,310 --> 00:11:41,839
that problem I would fill this room with

249
00:11:40,080 --> 00:11:45,120
pizzas I would open those doors

250
00:11:41,839 --> 00:11:46,500
developers love pizza I would then fill

251
00:11:45,120 --> 00:11:48,630
the room with developers I would talk to

252
00:11:46,500 --> 00:11:50,310
him over there lunch for one hour about

253
00:11:48,630 --> 00:11:52,770
the most important thing to meet now

254
00:11:50,310 --> 00:11:55,949
that is pressing to them that they make

255
00:11:52,770 --> 00:11:57,360
commits in their code reviews and then I

256
00:11:55,950 --> 00:11:59,640
can measure the impact because I'm

257
00:11:57,360 --> 00:12:03,020
measuring frequently did that help

258
00:11:59,640 --> 00:12:05,250
because if it didn't help then why I

259
00:12:03,020 --> 00:12:06,390
need to find another means of getting

260
00:12:05,250 --> 00:12:09,420
after these developers so they have the

261
00:12:06,390 --> 00:12:11,310
right people in the room you need to

262
00:12:09,420 --> 00:12:14,719
measure to make sure that you're having

263
00:12:11,310 --> 00:12:14,719
that desired impact

264
00:12:16,600 --> 00:12:21,970
tanja also said this you need to

265
00:12:18,850 --> 00:12:25,510
understand how the sausage is made if

266
00:12:21,970 --> 00:12:28,600
you went to the scrum master of one of

267
00:12:25,510 --> 00:12:31,360
your DevOps teams and said hey you know

268
00:12:28,600 --> 00:12:34,030
what I would really love to be a chicken

269
00:12:31,360 --> 00:12:37,630
in your nets next retrospective their

270
00:12:34,030 --> 00:12:39,400
head would fall off their bodies oh my

271
00:12:37,630 --> 00:12:43,120
god you understand my lingo you're

272
00:12:39,400 --> 00:12:44,380
speaking to me in my own language this

273
00:12:43,120 --> 00:12:50,320
is how you build those relationships

274
00:12:44,380 --> 00:12:51,760
with them last thing developers weren't

275
00:12:50,320 --> 00:12:53,040
trained to do this it's not that they

276
00:12:51,760 --> 00:12:55,720
don't care it's not that we don't care

277
00:12:53,040 --> 00:12:58,780
when I graduated from college no

278
00:12:55,720 --> 00:13:00,940
training in this even developers

279
00:12:58,780 --> 00:13:02,470
graduating today and by the way it's not

280
00:13:00,940 --> 00:13:04,210
just computer science degrees that are

281
00:13:02,470 --> 00:13:06,190
coming to us so even if we had a

282
00:13:04,210 --> 00:13:07,450
curriculum where it would be computer

283
00:13:06,190 --> 00:13:09,490
science majors and they had to take

284
00:13:07,450 --> 00:13:11,140
secure coding courses what about

285
00:13:09,490 --> 00:13:14,290
electrical engineers I see a ton of

286
00:13:11,140 --> 00:13:16,960
those in the software field or people

287
00:13:14,290 --> 00:13:18,880
that just learn on their own career

288
00:13:16,960 --> 00:13:20,470
changers they learn something they pick

289
00:13:18,880 --> 00:13:22,090
up some JavaScript or some Python and

290
00:13:20,470 --> 00:13:25,270
they're like wow I love this stuff let's

291
00:13:22,090 --> 00:13:26,590
do it you have to train them you have to

292
00:13:25,270 --> 00:13:29,079
help them fix what they find they don't

293
00:13:26,590 --> 00:13:31,330
understand these terms but you can make

294
00:13:29,080 --> 00:13:32,680
it fairly obvious to them how to fix

295
00:13:31,330 --> 00:13:38,770
these things and most of them are very

296
00:13:32,680 --> 00:13:43,420
easy all right second one mandate so I

297
00:13:38,770 --> 00:13:48,100
was at a b-sides conference before in

298
00:13:43,420 --> 00:13:49,599
Connecticut in the US where an OAuth

299
00:13:48,100 --> 00:13:52,540
chapter leader got up in front of the

300
00:13:49,600 --> 00:13:55,960
security audience and said we're gonna

301
00:13:52,540 --> 00:13:57,880
hold the developers accountable how does

302
00:13:55,960 --> 00:14:00,900
that make you guys feel feel a little

303
00:13:57,880 --> 00:14:03,550
threatening a little little aggressive

304
00:14:00,900 --> 00:14:06,550
this is not the world that you want to

305
00:14:03,550 --> 00:14:10,589
live in the world that we want to live

306
00:14:06,550 --> 00:14:13,900
in is for developers to say I take

307
00:14:10,590 --> 00:14:17,800
accountability I am responsible for the

308
00:14:13,900 --> 00:14:20,410
code that I write because they do that

309
00:14:17,800 --> 00:14:22,599
already does their code have to function

310
00:14:20,410 --> 00:14:24,490
when they check it in can they say

311
00:14:22,600 --> 00:14:27,970
they're done if it doesn't work the way

312
00:14:24,490 --> 00:14:31,510
the requirements said say hey I did my

313
00:14:27,970 --> 00:14:34,140
job I coded no they're accountable for

314
00:14:31,510 --> 00:14:37,900
the functionality of that feature the

315
00:14:34,140 --> 00:14:39,430
way we do this all right so when we have

316
00:14:37,900 --> 00:14:43,449
this mandate so these are the negative

317
00:14:39,430 --> 00:14:45,640
consequences when you have a mandate you

318
00:14:43,450 --> 00:14:48,610
say from the top we're gonna hold you

319
00:14:45,640 --> 00:14:52,210
accountable Tonya had a water analogy

320
00:14:48,610 --> 00:14:55,900
mine's a gate there's a gate developers

321
00:14:52,210 --> 00:14:57,400
will find a way around the gate and

322
00:14:55,900 --> 00:14:58,959
they'll do it a couple of different ways

323
00:14:57,400 --> 00:15:01,480
either avoid the conversations

324
00:14:58,960 --> 00:15:03,550
altogether ignore the results or

325
00:15:01,480 --> 00:15:05,560
there'll be the escalating phone calls

326
00:15:03,550 --> 00:15:07,089
to my boss and my boss and his boss and

327
00:15:05,560 --> 00:15:08,380
their boss until we find someone that's

328
00:15:07,089 --> 00:15:11,110
bigger than you and they say we're gonna

329
00:15:08,380 --> 00:15:12,820
ship it anyways or if you can really

330
00:15:11,110 --> 00:15:15,550
mandate the gate and very few companies

331
00:15:12,820 --> 00:15:19,450
can really do this you get this result

332
00:15:15,550 --> 00:15:21,579
which is also not what you want this is

333
00:15:19,450 --> 00:15:23,680
not a good outcome maybe maybe it makes

334
00:15:21,580 --> 00:15:29,440
the security people snicker and say haha

335
00:15:23,680 --> 00:15:30,969
I caught you so what we used to have

336
00:15:29,440 --> 00:15:33,790
these arguments that might my first

337
00:15:30,970 --> 00:15:35,290
startup engineers we sit around and we

338
00:15:33,790 --> 00:15:39,040
argue about you know how we were going

339
00:15:35,290 --> 00:15:40,870
to do something and our VP would say all

340
00:15:39,040 --> 00:15:41,650
right everybody stop pull out your

341
00:15:40,870 --> 00:15:44,020
business card

342
00:15:41,650 --> 00:15:47,170
now everyone look at the top left your

343
00:15:44,020 --> 00:15:49,060
business card hey guess what it all says

344
00:15:47,170 --> 00:15:52,479
the same company name that means we're

345
00:15:49,060 --> 00:15:54,339
all doing the same job for our company

346
00:15:52,480 --> 00:15:57,400
we are trying to build value here

347
00:15:54,339 --> 00:16:00,339
together enemies on the outside not in

348
00:15:57,400 --> 00:16:02,260
the room so we need to change how we

349
00:16:00,339 --> 00:16:03,160
think of this we do that through

350
00:16:02,260 --> 00:16:06,810
relationships

351
00:16:03,160 --> 00:16:08,890
I love Tonya's slide on roommates I

352
00:16:06,810 --> 00:16:11,439
don't quite think we should be roommates

353
00:16:08,890 --> 00:16:13,030
but you have to have that relationship

354
00:16:11,440 --> 00:16:14,290
you have to go out to lunch with them

355
00:16:13,030 --> 00:16:15,939
you have to talk to them about their

356
00:16:14,290 --> 00:16:18,219
problems and by the way you also need to

357
00:16:15,940 --> 00:16:20,230
talk to them about their goals because

358
00:16:18,220 --> 00:16:22,720
what's likely to you're likely to find

359
00:16:20,230 --> 00:16:25,600
is their goals go this way and yours go

360
00:16:22,720 --> 00:16:26,980
this way they are not aligned you are

361
00:16:25,600 --> 00:16:27,550
not pulling the rope in the same

362
00:16:26,980 --> 00:16:30,370
direction

363
00:16:27,550 --> 00:16:32,560
that's the company's fault not yours a

364
00:16:30,370 --> 00:16:33,520
lot of times developers don't do secure

365
00:16:32,560 --> 00:16:34,810
development because that's not what

366
00:16:33,520 --> 00:16:38,310
they're paid to do their goals say ship

367
00:16:34,810 --> 00:16:41,650
code fast all I care about

368
00:16:38,310 --> 00:16:43,000
why would I do that security you call

369
00:16:41,650 --> 00:16:44,170
them to say hey I got these security

370
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:45,550
vulnerabilities you need to fix them no

371
00:16:44,170 --> 00:16:46,959
I don't I need to ship this fast I'm

372
00:16:45,550 --> 00:16:51,520
already on the next thing sorry see you

373
00:16:46,959 --> 00:16:53,609
later you have to fix that alignment you

374
00:16:51,520 --> 00:16:58,449
have to have mutual accountability

375
00:16:53,610 --> 00:17:01,480
between development and security

376
00:16:58,450 --> 00:17:03,610
at the highest levels of the company I'm

377
00:17:01,480 --> 00:17:06,490
not talking about the masses right we've

378
00:17:03,610 --> 00:17:08,949
got this pyramid of leadership where at

379
00:17:06,490 --> 00:17:11,799
the bottom are hundreds or thousands or

380
00:17:08,949 --> 00:17:14,679
tens of thousands of developers I can't

381
00:17:11,799 --> 00:17:16,540
fight that battle what I can do is go to

382
00:17:14,679 --> 00:17:19,030
the seaso and go to the CIO

383
00:17:16,540 --> 00:17:21,280
put them in a room with the CEO and say

384
00:17:19,030 --> 00:17:24,699
is security important or is it not

385
00:17:21,280 --> 00:17:26,530
important because if it is then we

386
00:17:24,699 --> 00:17:28,120
should have this in our goals it should

387
00:17:26,530 --> 00:17:31,690
be developments responsibility to work

388
00:17:28,119 --> 00:17:35,110
with us not against us we are here to

389
00:17:31,690 --> 00:17:37,600
partner we are here to bring training to

390
00:17:35,110 --> 00:17:41,409
you we are here to help you with tools

391
00:17:37,600 --> 00:17:43,389
and awareness but we can't do it unless

392
00:17:41,410 --> 00:17:45,070
you're measured on it developers don't

393
00:17:43,390 --> 00:17:47,020
do it if they're not measured on it this

394
00:17:45,070 --> 00:17:49,120
is the number one thing that causes your

395
00:17:47,020 --> 00:17:51,429
abstract program to be difficult if

396
00:17:49,120 --> 00:17:53,830
you're finding it hard to get

397
00:17:51,429 --> 00:17:55,059
applications secured and not just the

398
00:17:53,830 --> 00:17:58,120
most important ones which we'll talk

399
00:17:55,059 --> 00:18:01,000
about in a minute but all of them this

400
00:17:58,120 --> 00:18:03,899
is likely the problem you're pushing not

401
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:09,370
pulling so one person against thousands

402
00:18:03,900 --> 00:18:11,530
what are the odds not good okay next one

403
00:18:09,370 --> 00:18:15,360
and this was the inception of the

404
00:18:11,530 --> 00:18:15,360
Maginot Line concept

405
00:18:15,670 --> 00:18:18,610
I'm just gonna protect the most

406
00:18:17,020 --> 00:18:20,770
important apps I would sit down with

407
00:18:18,610 --> 00:18:24,570
prospects they say we're just going to

408
00:18:20,770 --> 00:18:24,570
protect the most important applications

409
00:18:24,620 --> 00:18:32,750
what if I had a billing website for my

410
00:18:28,280 --> 00:18:34,100
HVAC contractor for a multi-billion

411
00:18:32,750 --> 00:18:35,600
dollar company does that sound like an

412
00:18:34,100 --> 00:18:39,100
important application to you would you

413
00:18:35,600 --> 00:18:41,679
think about securing that application

414
00:18:39,100 --> 00:18:46,669
target didn't

415
00:18:41,680 --> 00:18:50,750
so they fished the HVAC contractor got

416
00:18:46,670 --> 00:18:53,780
credentials got into their network and

417
00:18:50,750 --> 00:19:00,890
then spread all the way to point-of-sale

418
00:18:53,780 --> 00:19:04,250
machines it's important now now it

419
00:19:00,890 --> 00:19:07,429
sounds pretty important we can't ignore

420
00:19:04,250 --> 00:19:09,470
the fact that we throw steel doors up

421
00:19:07,429 --> 00:19:12,190
for our important applications but leave

422
00:19:09,470 --> 00:19:14,059
all the windows open in the house

423
00:19:12,190 --> 00:19:15,380
attackers know that and that's what

424
00:19:14,059 --> 00:19:18,940
they're gonna find I'm not going to

425
00:19:15,380 --> 00:19:18,940
bother trying to get through your door

426
00:19:20,780 --> 00:19:24,620
to get after this problem you have to

427
00:19:23,210 --> 00:19:28,340
think about this holistically you have

428
00:19:24,620 --> 00:19:29,959
to at least understand your risk so

429
00:19:28,340 --> 00:19:35,510
having a complete accounting of the

430
00:19:29,960 --> 00:19:37,670
applications that you have and map them

431
00:19:35,510 --> 00:19:39,110
into a maturity model so we do a lot

432
00:19:37,670 --> 00:19:40,370
with business criticality but also I

433
00:19:39,110 --> 00:19:43,129
believe that you should have a maturity

434
00:19:40,370 --> 00:19:44,540
model for these applications and there's

435
00:19:43,130 --> 00:19:47,390
some other metrics that we're gonna need

436
00:19:44,540 --> 00:19:50,360
to get and report on and look at and set

437
00:19:47,390 --> 00:19:54,560
policy on these applications and some of

438
00:19:50,360 --> 00:19:57,409
them are simple you can create an

439
00:19:54,560 --> 00:19:59,980
incredibly simple but effective maturity

440
00:19:57,410 --> 00:20:01,970
model with only a couple of measures

441
00:19:59,980 --> 00:20:04,310
typically when I come into companies

442
00:20:01,970 --> 00:20:05,510
they're protecting maybe you know five

443
00:20:04,310 --> 00:20:07,490
to ten percent of their total

444
00:20:05,510 --> 00:20:09,800
applications I work with customers that

445
00:20:07,490 --> 00:20:11,690
have eight ten thousand applications in

446
00:20:09,800 --> 00:20:13,730
their inventory I've seen hundreds of

447
00:20:11,690 --> 00:20:18,320
application security programs nobody

448
00:20:13,730 --> 00:20:19,790
covers them all so usually most of their

449
00:20:18,320 --> 00:20:21,080
applications are in ostrich phase I

450
00:20:19,790 --> 00:20:23,030
don't know anything about these

451
00:20:21,080 --> 00:20:25,730
applications hey can we at least

452
00:20:23,030 --> 00:20:27,830
baseline them all is that so hard

453
00:20:25,730 --> 00:20:30,770
can we get a baseline to understand the

454
00:20:27,830 --> 00:20:32,540
risk at least then for those

455
00:20:30,770 --> 00:20:34,840
applications that we need to have more

456
00:20:32,540 --> 00:20:37,700
security on let's start moving them up

457
00:20:34,840 --> 00:20:41,179
by doing frequent scanning and

458
00:20:37,700 --> 00:20:43,190
remediation being reactive to the stuff

459
00:20:41,180 --> 00:20:44,510
that we're getting working our way so

460
00:20:43,190 --> 00:20:45,830
understand that your application

461
00:20:44,510 --> 00:20:47,420
security programs are not going to be

462
00:20:45,830 --> 00:20:49,639
stellar the first day out you're gonna

463
00:20:47,420 --> 00:20:51,860
have to work on this for years so you

464
00:20:49,640 --> 00:20:54,680
start with that reactive model you scan

465
00:20:51,860 --> 00:20:56,629
you fix your scan you fix that's okay

466
00:20:54,680 --> 00:20:58,580
eventually you want to shift that left

467
00:20:56,630 --> 00:21:02,150
and you want to start to be proactive

468
00:20:58,580 --> 00:21:04,189
you be you're proactive by giving them

469
00:21:02,150 --> 00:21:05,900
training and tooling to help them

470
00:21:04,190 --> 00:21:08,180
prevent the errors in the first place or

471
00:21:05,900 --> 00:21:10,340
catch them prior to check-in your

472
00:21:08,180 --> 00:21:14,450
assurance scans should be should not be

473
00:21:10,340 --> 00:21:16,520
some mystery to the developers it should

474
00:21:14,450 --> 00:21:20,000
be an open book test that they can take

475
00:21:16,520 --> 00:21:22,220
before they check their code in if not

476
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:24,380
then what are you doing to them it's

477
00:21:22,220 --> 00:21:26,180
like a motorized goalpost I have no idea

478
00:21:24,380 --> 00:21:27,890
what target I'm trying to hit you need

479
00:21:26,180 --> 00:21:30,470
to provide clarity on what you want in

480
00:21:27,890 --> 00:21:33,110
the tooling to measure it and at least

481
00:21:30,470 --> 00:21:35,240
give them the opportunity to fail here's

482
00:21:33,110 --> 00:21:37,250
the standard here's the tool you could

483
00:21:35,240 --> 00:21:38,570
run it from your desktop I'm gonna

484
00:21:37,250 --> 00:21:40,160
double-check you this is a trust but

485
00:21:38,570 --> 00:21:42,200
verify so we saw Ronald Reagan up there

486
00:21:40,160 --> 00:21:44,030
before trust but verify

487
00:21:42,200 --> 00:21:45,830
assurance tests are never gonna go away

488
00:21:44,030 --> 00:21:52,850
it's just making sure that they did the

489
00:21:45,830 --> 00:21:54,050
right things metrics so again as you

490
00:21:52,850 --> 00:21:56,780
move up the maturity curve for your

491
00:21:54,050 --> 00:21:59,110
overall app SEC program

492
00:21:56,780 --> 00:22:02,210
how many scan versus on skin do you have

493
00:21:59,110 --> 00:22:03,770
what's your fine versus fixed rate am I

494
00:22:02,210 --> 00:22:06,320
getting better or am I getting worse how

495
00:22:03,770 --> 00:22:09,110
do I know you need to create heat maps

496
00:22:06,320 --> 00:22:10,879
of where your problems are where you

497
00:22:09,110 --> 00:22:13,820
should be focusing your limited amount

498
00:22:10,880 --> 00:22:15,470
of attention you don't have forever you

499
00:22:13,820 --> 00:22:18,320
need to get out of the tactics and get

500
00:22:15,470 --> 00:22:19,850
into the strategy you can only do that

501
00:22:18,320 --> 00:22:21,560
if you start collecting collecting some

502
00:22:19,850 --> 00:22:24,260
of these simple metrics to give you a

503
00:22:21,560 --> 00:22:26,659
guideposts to say this is the team I

504
00:22:24,260 --> 00:22:28,190
need to focus on today because they're

505
00:22:26,660 --> 00:22:30,080
fine versus fixed rated

506
00:22:28,190 --> 00:22:32,290
way-off-the-charts we're going in the

507
00:22:30,080 --> 00:22:32,290
wrong direction

508
00:22:34,230 --> 00:22:39,840
part of what you do when you talk to you

509
00:22:36,400 --> 00:22:42,150
CIO and see so as we start to report

510
00:22:39,840 --> 00:22:44,860
transparently to the whole organization

511
00:22:42,150 --> 00:22:46,720
here's where we are this is not

512
00:22:44,860 --> 00:22:50,740
something you use as a stick to attack

513
00:22:46,720 --> 00:22:52,360
them with is something you say we want

514
00:22:50,740 --> 00:22:56,860
to be better here's where we are

515
00:22:52,360 --> 00:22:59,709
it's just truth they are facts then they

516
00:22:56,860 --> 00:23:01,240
start to say one team versus another so

517
00:22:59,710 --> 00:23:03,460
if the CIO doesn't look very good with

518
00:23:01,240 --> 00:23:05,230
the amount of apps Avon boarded or the

519
00:23:03,460 --> 00:23:07,030
fix rates that they have then he's gonna

520
00:23:05,230 --> 00:23:08,680
start talking to his direct reports and

521
00:23:07,030 --> 00:23:11,230
they'll start talking to their direct

522
00:23:08,680 --> 00:23:12,670
reports and so on down the line they

523
00:23:11,230 --> 00:23:15,850
will get to that bottom of that pyramid

524
00:23:12,670 --> 00:23:17,410
for you on their own but you need to

525
00:23:15,850 --> 00:23:18,790
have as part of this relationship the

526
00:23:17,410 --> 00:23:21,160
fact that you're gonna report to the CEO

527
00:23:18,790 --> 00:23:23,770
in a transparent manner to say here's

528
00:23:21,160 --> 00:23:25,450
how we're doing is that good enough or

529
00:23:23,770 --> 00:23:27,610
not these are business decisions and

530
00:23:25,450 --> 00:23:29,770
that's okay if we decide that we're

531
00:23:27,610 --> 00:23:32,520
going to take risk but let's understand

532
00:23:29,770 --> 00:23:32,520
the risk first

533
00:23:33,590 --> 00:23:41,179
all right the next one this this one

534
00:23:36,920 --> 00:23:45,680
just kills me open source can anyone in

535
00:23:41,180 --> 00:23:49,070
this room besides me because I can give

536
00:23:45,680 --> 00:23:51,710
me the full bill of materials for any of

537
00:23:49,070 --> 00:23:53,330
the applications that they ship one I'll

538
00:23:51,710 --> 00:23:59,060
take one application can anyone do that

539
00:23:53,330 --> 00:24:00,830
for one application I have no hands so

540
00:23:59,060 --> 00:24:03,320
I'll assume that you can't do it for all

541
00:24:00,830 --> 00:24:06,439
of your applications this is where

542
00:24:03,320 --> 00:24:08,570
attackers are today they don't need to

543
00:24:06,440 --> 00:24:11,510
understand your first party problems

544
00:24:08,570 --> 00:24:15,760
when you have a raft full of third party

545
00:24:11,510 --> 00:24:21,010
problems so let's take a look at this so

546
00:24:15,760 --> 00:24:21,010
the Equifax breach last year

547
00:24:22,360 --> 00:24:27,340
opensource struts is a vulnerability

548
00:24:26,260 --> 00:24:30,158
that they could have patched they had

549
00:24:27,340 --> 00:24:32,620
plenty of time to do it but they didn't

550
00:24:30,159 --> 00:24:34,990
I will assert that they didn't know they

551
00:24:32,620 --> 00:24:37,779
had no idea and these kinds of attacks

552
00:24:34,990 --> 00:24:39,940
just need to be coded correctly I need

553
00:24:37,779 --> 00:24:42,929
to have the right kind of HTTP request

554
00:24:39,940 --> 00:24:45,570
to every application on the Internet

555
00:24:42,929 --> 00:24:48,399
remember when the Dyne dns was was

556
00:24:45,570 --> 00:24:51,789
attacked denial of service we lost half

557
00:24:48,399 --> 00:24:54,090
the Internet they took over the IP

558
00:24:51,789 --> 00:24:57,460
cameras that are sitting in our houses

559
00:24:54,090 --> 00:24:58,779
created a robot army put code on and

560
00:24:57,460 --> 00:25:00,549
just start spraying the Internet they

561
00:24:58,779 --> 00:25:03,190
didn't find Equifax because they were

562
00:25:00,549 --> 00:25:06,190
looking for Equifax they said here's an

563
00:25:03,190 --> 00:25:09,159
attack and I can automate it awesome I

564
00:25:06,190 --> 00:25:10,600
get all this free compute off we go it

565
00:25:09,159 --> 00:25:11,830
reports back when I found something and

566
00:25:10,600 --> 00:25:13,330
then I'm gonna go look at it and see if

567
00:25:11,830 --> 00:25:17,320
I want to do anything about it when they

568
00:25:13,330 --> 00:25:21,370
found Equifax yeah this is awesome we

569
00:25:17,320 --> 00:25:22,899
hit the gold mine here so understand

570
00:25:21,370 --> 00:25:25,209
that this is probably the biggest risk

571
00:25:22,899 --> 00:25:28,479
to your company today and you have no

572
00:25:25,210 --> 00:25:30,549
idea whether or not you are vulnerable

573
00:25:28,480 --> 00:25:34,240
and I'm gonna assert that you probably

574
00:25:30,549 --> 00:25:36,639
our new code today so who in the

575
00:25:34,240 --> 00:25:39,100
audience applications are monolithic

576
00:25:36,639 --> 00:25:41,019
applications the old school stuff right

577
00:25:39,100 --> 00:25:43,570
I've got some I'm sure everybody does

578
00:25:41,019 --> 00:25:45,260
who's writing micro services smaller

579
00:25:43,570 --> 00:25:48,520
chunks of code

580
00:25:45,260 --> 00:25:48,520
Casey what's against

581
00:25:48,790 --> 00:25:54,490
80 to 95 percent of that code that

582
00:25:52,330 --> 00:25:59,020
you're shipping in those microservices

583
00:25:54,490 --> 00:26:02,470
is open-source this is like going to

584
00:25:59,020 --> 00:26:06,850
Home Depot which is a building supply

585
00:26:02,470 --> 00:26:08,590
house in the US and we have all the

586
00:26:06,850 --> 00:26:11,320
parts there right I got two by fours

587
00:26:08,590 --> 00:26:14,500
I've got drywall I've got I've got

588
00:26:11,320 --> 00:26:17,350
plywood cement all of those things that

589
00:26:14,500 --> 00:26:19,330
I need to build a house I could have

590
00:26:17,350 --> 00:26:21,280
everyone in this room buy all the exact

591
00:26:19,330 --> 00:26:22,659
same supplies and then you all build a

592
00:26:21,280 --> 00:26:24,910
house and they're all going to look

593
00:26:22,660 --> 00:26:26,800
different this is how open-source works

594
00:26:24,910 --> 00:26:28,360
we take all of this open source we

595
00:26:26,800 --> 00:26:31,540
stitch it together with our little magic

596
00:26:28,360 --> 00:26:34,030
and magic smoke and then we ship it to

597
00:26:31,540 --> 00:26:37,800
customers and it's our own flavor but

598
00:26:34,030 --> 00:26:37,800
it's built out of the same components

599
00:26:39,990 --> 00:26:44,879
it's not more or less secure than your

600
00:26:43,230 --> 00:26:46,230
first party code so I really want to

601
00:26:44,879 --> 00:26:47,730
make sure you understand that it's not

602
00:26:46,230 --> 00:26:49,799
that open source is bad and I'm not here

603
00:26:47,730 --> 00:26:52,559
to say that open source is great it

604
00:26:49,799 --> 00:26:55,830
helps us to do awesome things but as a

605
00:26:52,559 --> 00:26:57,360
developer I will also tell you that when

606
00:26:55,830 --> 00:27:00,600
I integrate an open source library that

607
00:26:57,360 --> 00:27:02,908
does something I need I'm done with that

608
00:27:00,600 --> 00:27:06,178
conversation after that I never look at

609
00:27:02,909 --> 00:27:11,340
it again I integrate it and then I

610
00:27:06,179 --> 00:27:15,059
abandon it so it ages and it doesn't age

611
00:27:11,340 --> 00:27:18,480
like wine for my French comrade it ages

612
00:27:15,059 --> 00:27:20,158
like milk there are vulnerabilities in

613
00:27:18,480 --> 00:27:23,820
there so when you ship something in open

614
00:27:20,159 --> 00:27:26,100
source people say it's known good no no

615
00:27:23,820 --> 00:27:28,649
no no it's not no good it's just not

616
00:27:26,100 --> 00:27:30,330
known bad yet we don't know what's in

617
00:27:28,649 --> 00:27:33,360
there we haven't found the things yet

618
00:27:30,330 --> 00:27:35,039
people will find them believe me so

619
00:27:33,360 --> 00:27:37,860
understand that that that's happening so

620
00:27:35,039 --> 00:27:41,070
let's take a look at an example so who

621
00:27:37,860 --> 00:27:43,918
are my developers in the house again if

622
00:27:41,070 --> 00:27:45,689
I ask these developers here do you use

623
00:27:43,919 --> 00:27:47,159
struts or not in your application if I

624
00:27:45,690 --> 00:27:48,289
ask Tonya Tonya do you struts in your

625
00:27:47,159 --> 00:27:50,970
application

626
00:27:48,289 --> 00:27:52,769
the answer's no she knows with great

627
00:27:50,970 --> 00:27:55,950
deal of certainty whether or not she

628
00:27:52,769 --> 00:27:58,519
uses this very high level framework for

629
00:27:55,950 --> 00:27:58,519
an application

630
00:27:59,050 --> 00:28:06,280
and take a look at the versions this is

631
00:28:02,559 --> 00:28:08,649
what we see in our state of software

632
00:28:06,280 --> 00:28:11,020
security port we look at this this

633
00:28:08,650 --> 00:28:14,740
spread of versions the one that's the

634
00:28:11,020 --> 00:28:15,790
highest is also a vulnerable version we

635
00:28:14,740 --> 00:28:17,380
never clean up after ourselves

636
00:28:15,790 --> 00:28:22,450
developers don't do that

637
00:28:17,380 --> 00:28:25,540
so this is the easy case Tanya do you

638
00:28:22,450 --> 00:28:28,260
use Apache Commons collections in your

639
00:28:25,540 --> 00:28:28,260
application

640
00:28:29,660 --> 00:28:34,580
alright alright so I'll give you that

641
00:28:31,610 --> 00:28:36,860
but have you used it in the past okay

642
00:28:34,580 --> 00:28:38,570
all right so she's an exception most

643
00:28:36,860 --> 00:28:42,290
people won't know because it's buried

644
00:28:38,570 --> 00:28:44,210
way down deep inside other components it

645
00:28:42,290 --> 00:28:47,030
comes along for the ride when I install

646
00:28:44,210 --> 00:28:49,370
JBoss I install struts it's just there

647
00:28:47,030 --> 00:28:51,889
it's a base library that gets

648
00:28:49,370 --> 00:28:54,830
incorporated and included and here's the

649
00:28:51,890 --> 00:28:56,660
spread of those versions and the ones

650
00:28:54,830 --> 00:29:00,280
that are most frequent like Apache

651
00:28:56,660 --> 00:29:02,930
Commons 3.2.1 is one of the most

652
00:29:00,280 --> 00:29:06,050
violated it has a ton of vulnerabilities

653
00:29:02,930 --> 00:29:07,400
in it so let's take a look at that

654
00:29:06,050 --> 00:29:11,600
specific version

655
00:29:07,400 --> 00:29:14,030
so here's Apache Commons 3.2.1 and the

656
00:29:11,600 --> 00:29:17,449
components that start to included as it

657
00:29:14,030 --> 00:29:19,280
goes down the line unlike someone who

658
00:29:17,450 --> 00:29:21,680
has to be guests within five generations

659
00:29:19,280 --> 00:29:23,660
how many open-source components include

660
00:29:21,680 --> 00:29:27,860
Apache Commons collection does anyone

661
00:29:23,660 --> 00:29:32,150
have a ballpark guess who thinks it

662
00:29:27,860 --> 00:29:33,709
might be in the hundreds thousands

663
00:29:32,150 --> 00:29:36,110
I get a couple thousand tens of

664
00:29:33,710 --> 00:29:40,810
thousands alright and the rest of you I

665
00:29:36,110 --> 00:29:45,500
guess your arms are stopped working over

666
00:29:40,810 --> 00:29:47,510
80,000 components include this specific

667
00:29:45,500 --> 00:29:52,480
version of this specific vulnerable

668
00:29:47,510 --> 00:29:55,310
library I hope your eyes just opened up

669
00:29:52,480 --> 00:29:56,960
this is the size of the problem you

670
00:29:55,310 --> 00:29:59,389
don't know that you have Apache Commons

671
00:29:56,960 --> 00:30:01,370
collection so when a CVE gets announced

672
00:29:59,390 --> 00:30:02,810
for info those immunities that don't

673
00:30:01,370 --> 00:30:04,879
know what that is common vulnerability

674
00:30:02,810 --> 00:30:05,990
enumeration this is the publicly facing

675
00:30:04,880 --> 00:30:08,000
announcement that there's a

676
00:30:05,990 --> 00:30:09,470
vulnerability in something when it comes

677
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:11,270
out and says you've got a problem in

678
00:30:09,470 --> 00:30:13,610
Apache Commons collection they're like I

679
00:30:11,270 --> 00:30:15,910
don't use that do you use that no we use

680
00:30:13,610 --> 00:30:15,909
struts

681
00:30:18,640 --> 00:30:22,929
it's used in millions of applications

682
00:30:20,230 --> 00:30:25,659
and like I said before developers just

683
00:30:22,929 --> 00:30:27,070
abandon it they're like you know what it

684
00:30:25,659 --> 00:30:29,850
works and I don't have to look it

685
00:30:27,070 --> 00:30:34,240
anymore I have to put move code quickly

686
00:30:29,850 --> 00:30:35,590
the way we get after this problem so

687
00:30:34,240 --> 00:30:38,890
this is similar in concept to the

688
00:30:35,590 --> 00:30:40,840
roommate thing but if I have one Tanya

689
00:30:38,890 --> 00:30:44,019
and I've got thousands of developers

690
00:30:40,840 --> 00:30:48,340
over dozens of teams

691
00:30:44,019 --> 00:30:49,779
I need a knapsack army I need people

692
00:30:48,340 --> 00:30:52,779
that are in the room when we're having

693
00:30:49,779 --> 00:30:56,139
conversations about the application now

694
00:30:52,779 --> 00:30:58,570
who could we find in our organizations

695
00:30:56,139 --> 00:31:01,689
that are in all of the meetings when

696
00:30:58,570 --> 00:31:04,840
we're talking about our applications how

697
00:31:01,690 --> 00:31:07,360
about that team as we move from

698
00:31:04,840 --> 00:31:11,799
waterfall to agile we change team size

699
00:31:07,360 --> 00:31:13,990
from 50 or more to 6 to 12 small team

700
00:31:11,799 --> 00:31:17,500
and by the way DevOps is usually run on

701
00:31:13,990 --> 00:31:19,240
that kind of agile methodology small

702
00:31:17,500 --> 00:31:20,620
team they need to be cross-trained this

703
00:31:19,240 --> 00:31:22,480
is one of the places where you can cross

704
00:31:20,620 --> 00:31:23,889
train them find that person that's very

705
00:31:22,480 --> 00:31:26,500
interested in this and say you know what

706
00:31:23,889 --> 00:31:27,519
I'm gonna up train you and by the way as

707
00:31:26,500 --> 00:31:31,059
a development leader

708
00:31:27,519 --> 00:31:34,870
I don't like bus backers of one I'd like

709
00:31:31,059 --> 00:31:36,700
to I need some redundancy so find a

710
00:31:34,870 --> 00:31:37,870
couple of those people on that team it

711
00:31:36,700 --> 00:31:41,380
doesn't have to be a developer it could

712
00:31:37,870 --> 00:31:43,449
be quality it could be operations give

713
00:31:41,380 --> 00:31:45,610
them start with basics checklist here's

714
00:31:43,450 --> 00:31:48,429
the checklist what we want from them in

715
00:31:45,610 --> 00:31:49,689
this specific instance is I want you to

716
00:31:48,429 --> 00:31:52,000
be responsible for creating that Bill of

717
00:31:49,690 --> 00:31:55,240
Materials for your application I need to

718
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:57,880
have that in a searchable repository so

719
00:31:55,240 --> 00:32:01,059
that way if a CV is announced I can go

720
00:31:57,880 --> 00:32:02,620
and look and then find it and say ha

721
00:32:01,059 --> 00:32:04,870
these are the teams I need to go talk to

722
00:32:02,620 --> 00:32:07,090
I will call up those security champions

723
00:32:04,870 --> 00:32:08,268
this is my product incident response

724
00:32:07,090 --> 00:32:13,428
team

725
00:32:08,269 --> 00:32:15,799
I spin them up and say I have a problem

726
00:32:13,429 --> 00:32:17,629
with this specific library that is in

727
00:32:15,799 --> 00:32:20,509
you're currently shipping application I

728
00:32:17,629 --> 00:32:23,799
need you to come back to me with how

729
00:32:20,509 --> 00:32:26,479
we're gonna fix it and and by when and

730
00:32:23,799 --> 00:32:29,349
then let them do that work you need a

731
00:32:26,479 --> 00:32:31,339
force multiplier you need to have this

732
00:32:29,349 --> 00:32:34,339
other thing important thing to consider

733
00:32:31,339 --> 00:32:36,979
as ECB's announced they may have

734
00:32:34,339 --> 00:32:38,479
exploits on them already one of the

735
00:32:36,979 --> 00:32:41,719
things you need to understand as you're

736
00:32:38,479 --> 00:32:44,209
assessing the risk to your company and

737
00:32:41,719 --> 00:32:45,739
to those specific applications is how

738
00:32:44,209 --> 00:32:47,959
long is it going to take them to ship a

739
00:32:45,739 --> 00:32:49,849
change and it's not how long it's going

740
00:32:47,959 --> 00:32:52,429
to take them to fix this because that's

741
00:32:49,849 --> 00:32:54,259
a different matter but what you can

742
00:32:52,429 --> 00:32:56,299
figure out is what methodology to use

743
00:32:54,259 --> 00:32:57,709
how frequently do they update how long

744
00:32:56,299 --> 00:32:59,149
does it take them to test because if it

745
00:32:57,709 --> 00:33:02,779
takes them two months to test their

746
00:32:59,149 --> 00:33:03,918
application before they ship it you have

747
00:33:02,779 --> 00:33:05,239
a couple of choices I ship without

748
00:33:03,919 --> 00:33:07,700
testing which is going to be really

749
00:33:05,239 --> 00:33:09,049
risky well maybe I have to pull the plug

750
00:33:07,700 --> 00:33:10,429
in the application some companies have

751
00:33:09,049 --> 00:33:12,649
done that so you know what we have to

752
00:33:10,429 --> 00:33:14,119
take that application offline so could

753
00:33:12,649 --> 00:33:16,549
take us too long to fix and it's too

754
00:33:14,119 --> 00:33:18,139
great a risk but if you don't understand

755
00:33:16,549 --> 00:33:22,539
that mean time to repair or that mean

756
00:33:18,139 --> 00:33:22,539
time to change then you're working blind

757
00:33:25,230 --> 00:33:27,990
so we went through this with the

758
00:33:26,850 --> 00:33:30,299
security champions right you need a

759
00:33:27,990 --> 00:33:31,769
monitor for new CVEs

760
00:33:30,299 --> 00:33:33,690
you need to take a look at your

761
00:33:31,769 --> 00:33:36,450
inventory understand what's going on

762
00:33:33,690 --> 00:33:39,630
spin up your P search product security

763
00:33:36,450 --> 00:33:42,000
incident response team do tabletop

764
00:33:39,630 --> 00:33:46,139
exercises train them help them get that

765
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:47,880
muscle to work this is the only way to

766
00:33:46,139 --> 00:33:50,309
get after this problem we do not have

767
00:33:47,880 --> 00:33:55,169
enough security people to go around we

768
00:33:50,309 --> 00:33:57,870
need to build them all right so to wrap

769
00:33:55,169 --> 00:34:01,049
all this up in a lot of ways we are

770
00:33:57,870 --> 00:34:02,879
going in the wrong direction there are

771
00:34:01,049 --> 00:34:06,870
some simple adjustments that can be made

772
00:34:02,880 --> 00:34:09,210
to make us better as a company remember

773
00:34:06,870 --> 00:34:11,790
take out the business cards do that with

774
00:34:09,210 --> 00:34:13,949
the developers hey you have your

775
00:34:11,790 --> 00:34:15,300
business card for a second oh look same

776
00:34:13,949 --> 00:34:17,759
company name maybe we should work

777
00:34:15,300 --> 00:34:22,040
together being paid by the same people

778
00:34:17,760 --> 00:34:25,740
for the same investors let's think about

779
00:34:22,040 --> 00:34:29,449
creating relationships and changing the

780
00:34:25,739 --> 00:34:31,979
goals if we create secured developers

781
00:34:29,449 --> 00:34:33,569
guess what we have now added value to

782
00:34:31,980 --> 00:34:37,949
the company we are no longer a cost

783
00:34:33,569 --> 00:34:38,969
center and you can show this to the

784
00:34:37,949 --> 00:34:41,339
people you work for

785
00:34:38,969 --> 00:34:43,949
I made the developers faster because

786
00:34:41,339 --> 00:34:45,509
they stopped coding these things we

787
00:34:43,949 --> 00:34:47,069
don't have sequel injection anymore we

788
00:34:45,510 --> 00:34:50,369
don't have cross-site scripting anymore

789
00:34:47,069 --> 00:34:52,290
we don't have OS command injection they

790
00:34:50,369 --> 00:34:54,119
don't exist because I told them just do

791
00:34:52,290 --> 00:34:57,149
it this way and they're like oh ok I can

792
00:34:54,119 --> 00:34:58,980
do that you provide them the tools you

793
00:34:57,149 --> 00:35:00,930
provide them the training you get better

794
00:34:58,980 --> 00:35:02,910
results they go faster we looked at that

795
00:35:00,930 --> 00:35:04,950
example I don't have to find it fix it

796
00:35:02,910 --> 00:35:06,049
retested all that stuff well that stuff

797
00:35:04,950 --> 00:35:09,410
has to happen

798
00:35:06,050 --> 00:35:11,720
so think about how you are going to be a

799
00:35:09,410 --> 00:35:12,980
partner to development and if you're a

800
00:35:11,720 --> 00:35:15,470
developer in the room how you're gonna

801
00:35:12,980 --> 00:35:17,660
be a partner with security because once

802
00:35:15,470 --> 00:35:19,549
you have that mutual accountability all

803
00:35:17,660 --> 00:35:23,210
of the conversations you have are gonna

804
00:35:19,550 --> 00:35:25,670
be so much easier you are not gonna be

805
00:35:23,210 --> 00:35:26,630
pushing you're gonna be pulling ah I see

806
00:35:25,670 --> 00:35:27,920
you guys are having a problem with

807
00:35:26,630 --> 00:35:29,360
sequel injection can I come home and

808
00:35:27,920 --> 00:35:32,120
come in and give you training love to

809
00:35:29,360 --> 00:35:34,480
buy you guys lunch alright I thank you

810
00:35:32,120 --> 00:35:34,480
for your time

811
00:35:37,670 --> 00:35:43,359
am i doing for time here I'll get time

812
00:35:39,829 --> 00:35:43,359
for questions yes

813
00:35:48,520 --> 00:35:51,119
yes

814
00:35:51,900 --> 00:35:55,829
excellent so the question was if they're

815
00:35:54,420 --> 00:35:57,480
going to start an application security

816
00:35:55,829 --> 00:36:00,690
program for the first time what should

817
00:35:57,480 --> 00:36:02,880
they start with so there are a couple of

818
00:36:00,690 --> 00:36:05,640
very simple steps one is I need to know

819
00:36:02,880 --> 00:36:07,980
what applications I have right and we

820
00:36:05,640 --> 00:36:09,629
can find that a variety of ways we

821
00:36:07,980 --> 00:36:11,520
sometimes have changed control boards

822
00:36:09,630 --> 00:36:14,520
that change for at least active projects

823
00:36:11,520 --> 00:36:15,930
we can do web discovery for endpoints on

824
00:36:14,520 --> 00:36:17,788
the network that are responding to

825
00:36:15,930 --> 00:36:20,368
outside traffic and kind of work outside

826
00:36:17,789 --> 00:36:21,799
in we could take a look at our source

827
00:36:20,369 --> 00:36:24,720
code repositories or our binary

828
00:36:21,799 --> 00:36:27,750
repositories to go find things that were

829
00:36:24,720 --> 00:36:30,359
shipping today start there take a look

830
00:36:27,750 --> 00:36:32,670
at what tools you have available go find

831
00:36:30,359 --> 00:36:35,730
those tools so if you're working with

832
00:36:32,670 --> 00:36:37,529
agile or devops teams there are really

833
00:36:35,730 --> 00:36:38,849
three things you need to think about if

834
00:36:37,529 --> 00:36:40,829
you're going to purchase a tool and

835
00:36:38,849 --> 00:36:43,200
you're gonna need some tools because you

836
00:36:40,829 --> 00:36:44,460
can't do it with pen testers you don't

837
00:36:43,200 --> 00:36:46,140
have enough time and you can't cover

838
00:36:44,460 --> 00:36:48,329
enough ground and by the way for the

839
00:36:46,140 --> 00:36:49,799
stuff that those tools can find they can

840
00:36:48,329 --> 00:36:52,410
find it for pennies on the dollar I

841
00:36:49,799 --> 00:36:54,660
would rather have Tonya go and find some

842
00:36:52,410 --> 00:36:57,299
kind of way of some logic error or some

843
00:36:54,660 --> 00:36:59,910
time and state error that only a person

844
00:36:57,299 --> 00:37:01,640
could infer and figure out and have the

845
00:36:59,910 --> 00:37:04,700
computers find all my sequel injections

846
00:37:01,640 --> 00:37:07,170
you need to have something that is fast

847
00:37:04,700 --> 00:37:09,029
it needs to fit into the pipelines that

848
00:37:07,170 --> 00:37:10,740
they have today and in the work style

849
00:37:09,029 --> 00:37:12,599
that they have now for waterfall

850
00:37:10,740 --> 00:37:14,910
projects there's a whole lot more buffer

851
00:37:12,599 --> 00:37:17,700
room in there but as they get closer to

852
00:37:14,910 --> 00:37:20,368
doing DevOps and shipping daily or

853
00:37:17,700 --> 00:37:22,279
weekly that that time frame shrinks and

854
00:37:20,369 --> 00:37:25,230
their their attitude about that changes

855
00:37:22,279 --> 00:37:28,680
it needs to be actionable it needs to be

856
00:37:25,230 --> 00:37:31,170
incredibly accurate you cannot have 50

857
00:37:28,680 --> 00:37:33,480
first percent false positive rates if

858
00:37:31,170 --> 00:37:34,680
for every flaw they look at it as a 50%

859
00:37:33,480 --> 00:37:36,599
percent chance that I'm wasting my time

860
00:37:34,680 --> 00:37:38,890
how much time do you think they're going

861
00:37:36,599 --> 00:37:40,630
to take going after that

862
00:37:38,890 --> 00:37:42,490
and thirdly it needs to integrate in the

863
00:37:40,630 --> 00:37:44,890
tools that they have today you cannot

864
00:37:42,490 --> 00:37:47,439
send them a hundred page document or a

865
00:37:44,890 --> 00:37:50,379
spreadsheet or a pointer to your sim or

866
00:37:47,440 --> 00:37:53,170
your your CSM system you can't do that

867
00:37:50,380 --> 00:37:55,480
he needs to be in their IDE it needs to

868
00:37:53,170 --> 00:37:58,119
be in their build tools it needs to be

869
00:37:55,480 --> 00:38:00,809
in their bug tracking if you start

870
00:37:58,119 --> 00:38:02,769
making quality and security the same

871
00:38:00,809 --> 00:38:04,420
then you start to have a different

872
00:38:02,769 --> 00:38:05,950
conversation it goes into their triage

873
00:38:04,420 --> 00:38:11,279
meetings it's like oh we have things to

874
00:38:05,950 --> 00:38:11,279
fix so that that's yes sir

875
00:38:11,880 --> 00:38:19,299
they I am you were talking about like

876
00:38:16,240 --> 00:38:21,519
dependency management yeah would you

877
00:38:19,299 --> 00:38:24,009
agree that it's actually dependency

878
00:38:21,519 --> 00:38:27,009
reduction what we want think about what

879
00:38:24,010 --> 00:38:28,960
you use and see if you only use the pad

880
00:38:27,010 --> 00:38:32,349
that you could actually implement

881
00:38:28,960 --> 00:38:34,329
quickly on your own very fast and then

882
00:38:32,349 --> 00:38:37,329
instead of using a library where you

883
00:38:34,329 --> 00:38:40,390
just use like 5% of the code in there

884
00:38:37,329 --> 00:38:42,789
and 95% sticks around and this is

885
00:38:40,390 --> 00:38:45,670
vulnerable I heard someone mention in

886
00:38:42,789 --> 00:38:47,319
the talk ones that if you walk on the

887
00:38:45,670 --> 00:38:50,619
site when you're hungry and you find a

888
00:38:47,319 --> 00:38:52,390
hamburger what you eat it you probably

889
00:38:50,619 --> 00:38:54,190
wouldn't but developers do that all the

890
00:38:52,390 --> 00:38:55,598
time they find a library that does what

891
00:38:54,190 --> 00:39:00,160
they need and they they just implement

892
00:38:55,599 --> 00:39:06,080
right so I like the idea of actually

893
00:39:00,160 --> 00:39:07,790
reducing dependencies and as one of the

894
00:39:06,080 --> 00:39:09,620
the contents of the meetings that we

895
00:39:07,790 --> 00:39:12,800
have all the time talking about do we

896
00:39:09,620 --> 00:39:13,549
use this or can we do it on our own like

897
00:39:12,800 --> 00:39:20,480
a concept

898
00:39:13,550 --> 00:39:21,830
yeah so let's reimplementation the

899
00:39:20,480 --> 00:39:23,390
number of dependencies I have maybe only

900
00:39:21,830 --> 00:39:26,000
using 5% of the library that I've

901
00:39:23,390 --> 00:39:28,549
imported is that accurate all right so

902
00:39:26,000 --> 00:39:29,720
here are my thoughts on this first of

903
00:39:28,550 --> 00:39:31,970
all you're creating more work

904
00:39:29,720 --> 00:39:33,410
right so it's actual work for them to go

905
00:39:31,970 --> 00:39:34,790
figure out what they're using and prune

906
00:39:33,410 --> 00:39:36,259
out the things that don't and then

907
00:39:34,790 --> 00:39:37,640
figure out whether things still behaves

908
00:39:36,260 --> 00:39:41,150
the way that they think it does and

909
00:39:37,640 --> 00:39:42,830
should second when the next version of

910
00:39:41,150 --> 00:39:45,530
so in those examples where we have

911
00:39:42,830 --> 00:39:47,150
vulnerabilities in known libraries they

912
00:39:45,530 --> 00:39:49,730
don't patch the Brooklyn that you're

913
00:39:47,150 --> 00:39:52,100
using they patch the most current

914
00:39:49,730 --> 00:39:54,230
version always do they will never come

915
00:39:52,100 --> 00:39:55,790
back and patch the version that you're

916
00:39:54,230 --> 00:39:58,700
using especially if it's a really old

917
00:39:55,790 --> 00:40:01,100
one so what do you do now now you have

918
00:39:58,700 --> 00:40:03,200
to figure out well what parts did I how

919
00:40:01,100 --> 00:40:05,509
can I upgrade I can't just take it drop

920
00:40:03,200 --> 00:40:07,730
it in place retest and then redeploy I

921
00:40:05,510 --> 00:40:09,560
have to say well here's the parts I

922
00:40:07,730 --> 00:40:11,990
needed to prune out it's just it's a

923
00:40:09,560 --> 00:40:13,340
cost benefit I don't hate it but

924
00:40:11,990 --> 00:40:15,290
understand that you're adding more

925
00:40:13,340 --> 00:40:17,860
friction to the system than you might

926
00:40:15,290 --> 00:40:17,860
need to

927
00:40:20,570 --> 00:40:25,980
this is something nice that this library

928
00:40:23,160 --> 00:40:28,470
does but we only would need a very small

929
00:40:25,980 --> 00:40:29,190
card so let's see how we can do it

930
00:40:28,470 --> 00:40:32,879
ourselves

931
00:40:29,190 --> 00:40:34,620
so it becomes our own yeah so now we get

932
00:40:32,880 --> 00:40:37,020
into the not invented here problem well

933
00:40:34,620 --> 00:40:38,640
in you have to you have to make a

934
00:40:37,020 --> 00:40:40,910
decision there that's what I'm saying

935
00:40:38,640 --> 00:40:44,520
yes look at it and and then and then

936
00:40:40,910 --> 00:40:46,710
decide what you want to do yeah so this

937
00:40:44,520 --> 00:40:48,330
just blindly take everything in just

938
00:40:46,710 --> 00:40:50,580
because it happens to do what you need

939
00:40:48,330 --> 00:40:53,850
right so I like your metaphor mine is

940
00:40:50,580 --> 00:40:56,430
open sources like free puppy not like a

941
00:40:53,850 --> 00:40:57,870
free lunch right there are actual costs

942
00:40:56,430 --> 00:41:01,620
you have to walk your open source every

943
00:40:57,870 --> 00:41:03,660
once in a while you have to feed it so I

944
00:41:01,620 --> 00:41:05,339
I don't hate that buddy you you're

945
00:41:03,660 --> 00:41:06,930
adding costs now now I have something

946
00:41:05,340 --> 00:41:09,270
that could do it in five minutes but I

947
00:41:06,930 --> 00:41:12,000
might take a month to go redo it so if

948
00:41:09,270 --> 00:41:13,590
you ask Tonya about hey I visit this

949
00:41:12,000 --> 00:41:15,510
great open source library that does

950
00:41:13,590 --> 00:41:17,010
encryption but you know what we don't

951
00:41:15,510 --> 00:41:20,760
use all of it so I'm just gonna write my

952
00:41:17,010 --> 00:41:22,710
own it's you won't do it as well as the

953
00:41:20,760 --> 00:41:24,300
experts I wrote that library and you

954
00:41:22,710 --> 00:41:26,070
don't get it the benefit of any fixes so

955
00:41:24,300 --> 00:41:27,540
now you need to build a competency in

956
00:41:26,070 --> 00:41:29,550
encryption that you didn't have before

957
00:41:27,540 --> 00:41:31,080
when you're you know primary goal is to

958
00:41:29,550 --> 00:41:33,420
sell product to customers so I

959
00:41:31,080 --> 00:41:34,590
understand the intention but it adds a

960
00:41:33,420 --> 00:41:36,360
whole lot of complexity to the

961
00:41:34,590 --> 00:41:37,320
development process in time and now

962
00:41:36,360 --> 00:41:38,160
you're going to start to get kicked out

963
00:41:37,320 --> 00:41:40,520
of the room they're gonna say you know

964
00:41:38,160 --> 00:41:45,440
what I don't really want to talk to you

965
00:41:40,520 --> 00:41:45,440
anyone else yes sir

966
00:41:52,020 --> 00:41:57,330
yes have you seen organizations tracking

967
00:41:55,619 --> 00:42:00,270
cost throughout the course of the

968
00:41:57,330 --> 00:42:03,390
project because in the reality projects

969
00:42:00,270 --> 00:42:05,580
get started with a great cost that

970
00:42:03,390 --> 00:42:07,740
there's a budget mm-hmm so if you have a

971
00:42:05,580 --> 00:42:11,369
one year project going on there is a

972
00:42:07,740 --> 00:42:15,140
budget and some component is allocated

973
00:42:11,369 --> 00:42:18,240
to security yeah now we often say that

974
00:42:15,140 --> 00:42:21,319
your cost overruns because of security

975
00:42:18,240 --> 00:42:25,319
if you do everything on the right yeah

976
00:42:21,320 --> 00:42:28,410
but I think you hit a great point and

977
00:42:25,320 --> 00:42:31,470
I'm trying to validate that that if I

978
00:42:28,410 --> 00:42:34,560
were to just track my cost of my

979
00:42:31,470 --> 00:42:37,069
resources as you go in your project if

980
00:42:34,560 --> 00:42:39,810
they're spending a lot of cost upfront

981
00:42:37,070 --> 00:42:43,860
yeah at the left side of the project I

982
00:42:39,810 --> 00:42:46,890
seem to be doing well is that somebody

983
00:42:43,860 --> 00:42:48,960
yeah yes so what as you go up the

984
00:42:46,890 --> 00:42:50,730
maturity model what you start the track

985
00:42:48,960 --> 00:42:52,950
so initially remember we're an ostrich

986
00:42:50,730 --> 00:42:54,210
then we start to we baseline and then

987
00:42:52,950 --> 00:42:55,529
we're gonna be reactive so we're gonna

988
00:42:54,210 --> 00:42:57,540
find and fix things and we're gonna see

989
00:42:55,530 --> 00:42:59,369
a fine fix rate as we go now what you're

990
00:42:57,540 --> 00:43:00,990
gonna then start to do is they get more

991
00:42:59,369 --> 00:43:02,670
mature is you're gonna start to track

992
00:43:00,990 --> 00:43:03,779
incident rate I don't care about fixed

993
00:43:02,670 --> 00:43:05,670
rate because I know we're going in the

994
00:43:03,780 --> 00:43:07,080
right direction how often do the

995
00:43:05,670 --> 00:43:09,119
introducing something into the source

996
00:43:07,080 --> 00:43:11,759
code base that's your shift left metric

997
00:43:09,119 --> 00:43:14,460
right there right so yes it would be

998
00:43:11,760 --> 00:43:16,859
good to track that find out what phase

999
00:43:14,460 --> 00:43:19,560
you found it in I would use back in the

1000
00:43:16,859 --> 00:43:20,940
napkin stuff and not spend a lot of time

1001
00:43:19,560 --> 00:43:22,770
on trying to figure out the actual cost

1002
00:43:20,940 --> 00:43:24,390
because if you think about any code

1003
00:43:22,770 --> 00:43:27,060
change that you make needs to be

1004
00:43:24,390 --> 00:43:28,830
retested now god forbid and most

1005
00:43:27,060 --> 00:43:30,180
companies have this there's a lot of

1006
00:43:28,830 --> 00:43:32,580
manual in there there are people

1007
00:43:30,180 --> 00:43:33,750
involved where I unknit the sweater and

1008
00:43:32,580 --> 00:43:36,029
then I got to remit it and then it has

1009
00:43:33,750 --> 00:43:38,730
to go back through quality control that

1010
00:43:36,030 --> 00:43:40,050
is a real cost to having that change be

1011
00:43:38,730 --> 00:43:42,600
there and because you mentioned what is

1012
00:43:40,050 --> 00:43:44,470
the clone of an AB 16 yes so if I want

1013
00:43:42,600 --> 00:43:47,618
to measure my goal at the end of

1014
00:43:44,470 --> 00:43:49,779
yeah yeah how my sick team is doing mmm

1015
00:43:47,619 --> 00:43:52,390
I want to track the cost and see whether

1016
00:43:49,780 --> 00:43:55,000
they're spending less and less towards

1017
00:43:52,390 --> 00:43:57,310
yes so you mean there there is one

1018
00:43:55,000 --> 00:43:59,290
project that I am aware well so my

1019
00:43:57,310 --> 00:44:00,520
company does this because security is

1020
00:43:59,290 --> 00:44:03,130
our number one job but there are

1021
00:44:00,520 --> 00:44:06,220
companies very few of them in very few

1022
00:44:03,130 --> 00:44:07,300
projects that actually have no flaws in

1023
00:44:06,220 --> 00:44:09,520
their source code base for that

1024
00:44:07,300 --> 00:44:11,440
application now the next question that

1025
00:44:09,520 --> 00:44:12,040
gets asked so Tonya talked about writing

1026
00:44:11,440 --> 00:44:13,510
that check

1027
00:44:12,040 --> 00:44:15,880
why should I write this check there are

1028
00:44:13,510 --> 00:44:17,800
no vulnerabilities in there it's because

1029
00:44:15,880 --> 00:44:19,630
everything you did before has been

1030
00:44:17,800 --> 00:44:21,640
working so you need to start changing

1031
00:44:19,630 --> 00:44:24,070
what you measure for those very mature

1032
00:44:21,640 --> 00:44:26,950
teams to start looking at utilization of

1033
00:44:24,070 --> 00:44:28,420
tools acquisition of training the grades

1034
00:44:26,950 --> 00:44:30,430
that they get and the certifications

1035
00:44:28,420 --> 00:44:34,810
that they have in that to say that that

1036
00:44:30,430 --> 00:44:36,430
is what's keeping the zero in my source

1037
00:44:34,810 --> 00:44:37,900
code base is all the work that they're

1038
00:44:36,430 --> 00:44:38,950
doing before check-in so your absent

1039
00:44:37,900 --> 00:44:41,560
program actually looks like it's not

1040
00:44:38,950 --> 00:44:44,500
doing much after the after you've made

1041
00:44:41,560 --> 00:44:48,100
this fix yeah but you're years away from

1042
00:44:44,500 --> 00:44:50,440
that for most companies thanks

1043
00:44:48,100 --> 00:44:52,779
all right I am up with time I am here

1044
00:44:50,440 --> 00:44:53,980
for full two days so I would love to

1045
00:44:52,780 --> 00:44:56,280
have this talk with you thank you very

1046
00:44:53,980 --> 00:44:56,280
much

1047
00:44:58,390 --> 00:45:01,600
thanks big
