1
00:00:06,020 --> 00:00:13,360
[Music]

2
00:00:08,760 --> 00:00:15,879
and I brought my candies so questions

3
00:00:13,360 --> 00:00:17,619
after this talk you get a candy he's in

4
00:00:15,880 --> 00:00:22,060
charge he's got them except this one

5
00:00:17,619 --> 00:00:24,279
okay so this talk so welcome back I hope

6
00:00:22,060 --> 00:00:25,329
you had a delicious lunch oh my god the

7
00:00:24,279 --> 00:00:27,310
food here is amazing

8
00:00:25,329 --> 00:00:29,109
I can't even believe how well had been

9
00:00:27,310 --> 00:00:31,418
said anyway okay let's talk about the

10
00:00:29,109 --> 00:00:33,370
talk so pushing left like a boss so I

11
00:00:31,419 --> 00:00:34,720
wrote this talk so I was a software

12
00:00:33,370 --> 00:00:37,959
developer and then I switched into

13
00:00:34,720 --> 00:00:39,430
security and I wrote this talk because

14
00:00:37,960 --> 00:00:41,170
this is all the stuff that I wish

15
00:00:39,430 --> 00:00:43,690
someone told me four years ago at the

16
00:00:41,170 --> 00:00:45,160
beginning I had to figure this out had

17
00:00:43,690 --> 00:00:47,349
to figure out what the activities were

18
00:00:45,160 --> 00:00:49,328
that you could do as part of

19
00:00:47,350 --> 00:00:50,859
applications security I am I felt like I

20
00:00:49,329 --> 00:00:53,320
was kind of stumbling around blind in

21
00:00:50,859 --> 00:00:55,329
the dark and so I made a talk that is

22
00:00:53,320 --> 00:00:57,429
just this is the foundation of app sack

23
00:00:55,329 --> 00:00:59,679
this is the stuff that I feel we should

24
00:00:57,429 --> 00:01:06,040
all know this is the stuff I wish every

25
00:00:59,679 --> 00:01:08,320
developer knew and so let's start okay

26
00:01:06,040 --> 00:01:09,940
so first of all I'm gonna explain what

27
00:01:08,320 --> 00:01:12,130
pushing left is and I feel like you'll

28
00:01:09,940 --> 00:01:14,590
already know but I really want you to

29
00:01:12,130 --> 00:01:16,420
know it when you go home so if you

30
00:01:14,590 --> 00:01:18,730
imagine the system development life

31
00:01:16,420 --> 00:01:20,470
cycle or sdlc as I like to call it

32
00:01:18,730 --> 00:01:23,500
written out on a piece of paper the

33
00:01:20,470 --> 00:01:26,679
further left you go oh no the further

34
00:01:23,500 --> 00:01:29,110
left you go the earlier you are and

35
00:01:26,680 --> 00:01:31,170
you're the earlier you are let's let's

36
00:01:29,110 --> 00:01:34,660
do my little there we go

37
00:01:31,170 --> 00:01:36,370
the earlier you are right so security

38
00:01:34,660 --> 00:01:40,570
would like to be invited to the party a

39
00:01:36,370 --> 00:01:42,160
little sooner in fact I would like to be

40
00:01:40,570 --> 00:01:45,039
invited to every single part of your

41
00:01:42,160 --> 00:01:46,509
SDLC so the security is addressed the

42
00:01:45,040 --> 00:01:47,670
whole way through I'm sorry is my hair

43
00:01:46,510 --> 00:01:51,470
touching the mic

44
00:01:47,670 --> 00:01:53,760
so I put it up this morning okay

45
00:01:51,470 --> 00:01:55,020
we're gonna come back to the slide later

46
00:01:53,760 --> 00:01:56,700
because I've heard you need to hear

47
00:01:55,020 --> 00:01:58,399
things three times to remember it and

48
00:01:56,700 --> 00:02:00,420
you already heard it at least once today

49
00:01:58,400 --> 00:02:01,740
so we will come back to it but I just

50
00:02:00,420 --> 00:02:03,390
wanted you to all know so I'm gonna

51
00:02:01,740 --> 00:02:06,169
refer to pushing left over and over

52
00:02:03,390 --> 00:02:08,910
again so you know what I'm saying

53
00:02:06,170 --> 00:02:11,370
when I used to go see talks they would

54
00:02:08,910 --> 00:02:13,230
always have this Who am I slide and I

55
00:02:11,370 --> 00:02:15,840
never understood why they had it until I

56
00:02:13,230 --> 00:02:20,070
had to write one the reason for this

57
00:02:15,840 --> 00:02:24,660
slide is to try to prove to you that I

58
00:02:20,070 --> 00:02:27,769
am qualified to give this talk it's a

59
00:02:24,660 --> 00:02:31,290
please please please consider my ideas

60
00:02:27,770 --> 00:02:35,430
please listen please consider doing them

61
00:02:31,290 --> 00:02:37,920
at your office so with that as of Monday

62
00:02:35,430 --> 00:02:39,720
I am a senior cloud advocate at

63
00:02:37,920 --> 00:02:42,269
Microsoft and I'm so excited to be there

64
00:02:39,720 --> 00:02:44,130
and I'm an application security

65
00:02:42,270 --> 00:02:46,050
evangelist I really like talking about

66
00:02:44,130 --> 00:02:48,359
apps tech I will bore you to tears with

67
00:02:46,050 --> 00:02:51,000
it if you let me I'll just go on and on

68
00:02:48,360 --> 00:02:53,370
I'm the chapter leader of a wasp and

69
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:55,560
Ottawa and I also started an open source

70
00:02:53,370 --> 00:02:57,660
a wasp project called dev swap with my

71
00:02:55,560 --> 00:02:59,670
friend Nicole Becker where we make

72
00:02:57,660 --> 00:03:01,290
crappy DevOps things and then show

73
00:02:59,670 --> 00:03:03,119
people how to hack them and show them

74
00:03:01,290 --> 00:03:05,670
how to secure them so it's kind of cool

75
00:03:03,120 --> 00:03:06,900
so far we have a bunch of vulnerable API

76
00:03:05,670 --> 00:03:08,190
it's but we're planning all sorts of

77
00:03:06,900 --> 00:03:12,690
interesting things for the future

78
00:03:08,190 --> 00:03:15,239
and I've been being paid to be geeky for

79
00:03:12,690 --> 00:03:17,700
over 20 years I started developing

80
00:03:15,239 --> 00:03:20,640
software at the young age of 16 and

81
00:03:17,700 --> 00:03:24,238
basically the point is is my goal is to

82
00:03:20,640 --> 00:03:26,429
try to make software like to try to make

83
00:03:24,239 --> 00:03:28,680
IT the easiest way to do something the

84
00:03:26,430 --> 00:03:31,470
most secure way to do the same thing I

85
00:03:28,680 --> 00:03:36,810
want secure to be a lot easier

86
00:03:31,470 --> 00:03:37,950
so let's talk about this the first

87
00:03:36,810 --> 00:03:40,500
couple slides are going to be a

88
00:03:37,950 --> 00:03:43,049
refresher for most of you so it's the

89
00:03:40,500 --> 00:03:44,220
state of affairs as we see it and the

90
00:03:43,050 --> 00:03:45,960
reason why I'm doing this it's gonna be

91
00:03:44,220 --> 00:03:47,490
like two three minutes long it's really

92
00:03:45,960 --> 00:03:48,840
short but I'm doing this to make sure

93
00:03:47,490 --> 00:03:51,060
we're all at the exact same level

94
00:03:48,840 --> 00:03:52,890
because well some of you are experts and

95
00:03:51,060 --> 00:03:54,300
have worked in apps like forever some of

96
00:03:52,890 --> 00:03:56,309
you this might be your first app tech

97
00:03:54,300 --> 00:03:58,080
conference this might be your first

98
00:03:56,310 --> 00:04:00,030
foray into this and I don't want to lose

99
00:03:58,080 --> 00:04:01,550
anyone in the audience so please be

100
00:04:00,030 --> 00:04:05,460
patient with me for the next two minutes

101
00:04:01,550 --> 00:04:06,510
so you've been hacked we are hearing

102
00:04:05,460 --> 00:04:10,080
about this constantly in the news

103
00:04:06,510 --> 00:04:13,590
constantly constantly but like someone

104
00:04:10,080 --> 00:04:14,960
else said this morning up to 90% of all

105
00:04:13,590 --> 00:04:18,000
of those breaches are caused by

106
00:04:14,960 --> 00:04:21,540
vulnerabilities in software and this is

107
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:25,160
a serious problem and we aren't focusing

108
00:04:21,540 --> 00:04:27,630
our energies on this as I feel we should

109
00:04:25,160 --> 00:04:30,510
so I don't feel Security's looking the

110
00:04:27,630 --> 00:04:33,300
wrong way I feel like they're just maybe

111
00:04:30,510 --> 00:04:34,590
not doing the 360 I would like I feel I

112
00:04:33,300 --> 00:04:36,720
see a lot of teams where they're

113
00:04:34,590 --> 00:04:38,909
focusing on the perimeter and they're

114
00:04:36,720 --> 00:04:41,520
doing an awesome job at it will really

115
00:04:38,910 --> 00:04:43,320
go with firewalls now they're focusing

116
00:04:41,520 --> 00:04:45,090
on patching awesome extremely important

117
00:04:43,320 --> 00:04:46,650
they're doing enterprise level security

118
00:04:45,090 --> 00:04:48,780
like taking away all those fun

119
00:04:46,650 --> 00:04:51,960
permissions like your admin on your

120
00:04:48,780 --> 00:04:53,280
desktop to lock things down and make

121
00:04:51,960 --> 00:04:55,049
things more secure and all of that is

122
00:04:53,280 --> 00:04:56,909
great but I feel like a lot of security

123
00:04:55,050 --> 00:04:58,470
teams are missing knowledge about how to

124
00:04:56,910 --> 00:05:00,110
make secure software and if you work

125
00:04:58,470 --> 00:05:03,470
somewhere and they are making software

126
00:05:00,110 --> 00:05:06,360
we want to be secure

127
00:05:03,470 --> 00:05:10,080
so what is application security or OPSEC

128
00:05:06,360 --> 00:05:14,130
for short so here I have it's the art of

129
00:05:10,080 --> 00:05:15,719
making software secure I joke that it's

130
00:05:14,130 --> 00:05:17,510
something that the security team wishes

131
00:05:15,720 --> 00:05:20,010
the developers would take care of for us

132
00:05:17,510 --> 00:05:22,320
and then it's something that the

133
00:05:20,010 --> 00:05:23,969
developers it's the security game which

134
00:05:22,320 --> 00:05:27,450
developers would take care for us and

135
00:05:23,970 --> 00:05:29,280
the developers are often unaware of they

136
00:05:27,450 --> 00:05:31,050
don't have time for it's not part of

137
00:05:29,280 --> 00:05:33,299
their actual job responsibilities

138
00:05:31,050 --> 00:05:34,620
officially there's no spot in their

139
00:05:33,300 --> 00:05:36,450
project where they're supposed to be

140
00:05:34,620 --> 00:05:38,040
doing this and then we end up with it

141
00:05:36,450 --> 00:05:39,420
being kind of in the cracks in between

142
00:05:38,040 --> 00:05:42,060
and that's where application security

143
00:05:39,420 --> 00:05:43,290
comes in so we are that part in-between

144
00:05:42,060 --> 00:05:45,480
we're like the bridge between the

145
00:05:43,290 --> 00:05:50,280
developers and the security team so that

146
00:05:45,480 --> 00:05:52,650
we actually make secure software another

147
00:05:50,280 --> 00:05:56,669
thing I see so as someone who did some

148
00:05:52,650 --> 00:05:59,429
consulting doing penetration tests I get

149
00:05:56,670 --> 00:06:01,980
called in at the last minute they've

150
00:05:59,430 --> 00:06:04,170
been making this app for eight months or

151
00:06:01,980 --> 00:06:05,790
nine months and they call me in the

152
00:06:04,170 --> 00:06:06,930
right tanja could you come in next week

153
00:06:05,790 --> 00:06:09,060
and do some tests because we're

154
00:06:06,930 --> 00:06:11,550
releasing in two weeks that is not when

155
00:06:09,060 --> 00:06:14,640
you want to call me you want to call me

156
00:06:11,550 --> 00:06:17,220
away before I mean I look cool don't get

157
00:06:14,640 --> 00:06:18,960
me wrong so I come in no one's looked at

158
00:06:17,220 --> 00:06:20,670
security the whole time and it's like a

159
00:06:18,960 --> 00:06:24,270
shooting fish in a barrel I look amazing

160
00:06:20,670 --> 00:06:26,730
like I found a hundred things but I'm a

161
00:06:24,270 --> 00:06:29,219
lot less concerned from a professional

162
00:06:26,730 --> 00:06:30,570
standpoint with looking cool as I am

163
00:06:29,220 --> 00:06:32,550
with like actually making sure you

164
00:06:30,570 --> 00:06:36,900
release a secure app because if I find a

165
00:06:32,550 --> 00:06:38,850
design flaw right like a logic flaw in

166
00:06:36,900 --> 00:06:41,250
your app like things need to change you

167
00:06:38,850 --> 00:06:43,200
can't do that in a week or two you know

168
00:06:41,250 --> 00:06:44,790
I need time to do the testing anytime to

169
00:06:43,200 --> 00:06:47,190
write the report I can't come to you the

170
00:06:44,790 --> 00:06:48,660
night before and then make you stay up

171
00:06:47,190 --> 00:06:50,160
all night fixing it like it's gonna be

172
00:06:48,660 --> 00:06:53,120
bubble gum and duct tape it's not gonna

173
00:06:50,160 --> 00:06:55,500
be good right so I see a lot of

174
00:06:53,120 --> 00:06:57,060
penetration testers being called in at

175
00:06:55,500 --> 00:07:00,150
the last minute and I have also seen

176
00:06:57,060 --> 00:07:03,780
some places aren't doing any security

177
00:07:00,150 --> 00:07:07,020
testing like places that you use their

178
00:07:03,780 --> 00:07:08,580
websites and they're just like oh we

179
00:07:07,020 --> 00:07:10,620
don't have budget for that we didn't

180
00:07:08,580 --> 00:07:11,820
have time to do a scan like they just

181
00:07:10,620 --> 00:07:13,380
don't even do a scan and they just

182
00:07:11,820 --> 00:07:16,800
release it to the Internet and they're

183
00:07:13,380 --> 00:07:21,480
like I hope it's okay this is not a good

184
00:07:16,800 --> 00:07:24,210
security plan so let's continue so who

185
00:07:21,480 --> 00:07:26,300
knows what this is CIA this is the

186
00:07:24,210 --> 00:07:28,620
reason why the security people have jobs

187
00:07:26,300 --> 00:07:30,750
confidentiality availability and

188
00:07:28,620 --> 00:07:34,080
integrity of your systems and your data

189
00:07:30,750 --> 00:07:36,600
right this is why if we get paid awesome

190
00:07:34,080 --> 00:07:41,550
when I give this talk to developers no

191
00:07:36,600 --> 00:07:43,170
one puts their hand up I feel like if

192
00:07:41,550 --> 00:07:45,390
you like security people are really good

193
00:07:43,170 --> 00:07:47,490
at being discreet we're really good at

194
00:07:45,390 --> 00:07:49,650
keeping secrets and hiding the things

195
00:07:47,490 --> 00:07:51,780
that we should but when we're supposed

196
00:07:49,650 --> 00:07:54,630
to promote things and tell people things

197
00:07:51,780 --> 00:07:57,059
and share that that's a weakness for us

198
00:07:54,630 --> 00:07:59,100
because we're so used to trying to hide

199
00:07:57,060 --> 00:08:00,480
everything and the fact that I give this

200
00:07:59,100 --> 00:08:03,750
talk I've given this talk at least

201
00:08:00,480 --> 00:08:05,580
thirty times if not 40 and I am so lucky

202
00:08:03,750 --> 00:08:07,560
if one or two or three software

203
00:08:05,580 --> 00:08:09,810
developers put their hands up they need

204
00:08:07,560 --> 00:08:12,240
to know why we're bothering them this is

205
00:08:09,810 --> 00:08:14,490
why I hustle you if your application has

206
00:08:12,240 --> 00:08:17,310
all this under control I will not bother

207
00:08:14,490 --> 00:08:19,560
you I will be your best friend right so

208
00:08:17,310 --> 00:08:21,780
I feel we need to learn to communicate

209
00:08:19,560 --> 00:08:26,300
more what developers what we need from

210
00:08:21,780 --> 00:08:30,719
them okay so with that one more time

211
00:08:26,300 --> 00:08:33,090
pushing left is when you start security

212
00:08:30,720 --> 00:08:35,130
earlier specifically riah at the

213
00:08:33,090 --> 00:08:37,050
beginning and all the way through I'm

214
00:08:35,130 --> 00:08:39,270
gonna give you an example to explain why

215
00:08:37,049 --> 00:08:40,978
pushing left is important so it cost

216
00:08:39,270 --> 00:08:43,860
less and you will do a better job of

217
00:08:40,979 --> 00:08:45,450
security if you push left let's say

218
00:08:43,860 --> 00:08:47,510
you're building a house so you and your

219
00:08:45,450 --> 00:08:49,860
spouse you've been saving up forever

220
00:08:47,510 --> 00:08:51,930
and you're building your dream home this

221
00:08:49,860 --> 00:08:55,030
is really great

222
00:08:51,930 --> 00:08:58,449
oops I had a timer set but I paused it

223
00:08:55,030 --> 00:09:01,630
Mike how can I be at sixteen seconds so

224
00:08:58,450 --> 00:09:03,970
you're building a house you and your

225
00:09:01,630 --> 00:09:06,460
sweetheart you planned it forever

226
00:09:03,970 --> 00:09:08,320
and you know they're just at that the

227
00:09:06,460 --> 00:09:10,450
finishing phases they're putting the

228
00:09:08,320 --> 00:09:12,130
handles on the cupboards you know

229
00:09:10,450 --> 00:09:13,870
they're they're putting in the windows

230
00:09:12,130 --> 00:09:15,760
you're gonna put up drapes soon you're

231
00:09:13,870 --> 00:09:18,580
really close to being done and then your

232
00:09:15,760 --> 00:09:20,500
spouse says oh honey maybe we should

233
00:09:18,580 --> 00:09:24,520
have put in more bathrooms we only have

234
00:09:20,500 --> 00:09:26,550
one and we have seven kids mmm you

235
00:09:24,520 --> 00:09:29,230
should have thought of that threat model

236
00:09:26,550 --> 00:09:32,530
that's a lot of bladders with one

237
00:09:29,230 --> 00:09:36,220
bathroom to share this is a design flaw

238
00:09:32,530 --> 00:09:38,020
right so this this isn't a bug which is

239
00:09:36,220 --> 00:09:39,640
like a problem with the coating that

240
00:09:38,020 --> 00:09:41,800
could be changed later this is a flaw

241
00:09:39,640 --> 00:09:43,770
this is your design so what are you

242
00:09:41,800 --> 00:09:45,969
gonna do maybe you're gonna sacrifice a

243
00:09:43,770 --> 00:09:47,199
walk-in closet and turn it into a

244
00:09:45,970 --> 00:09:48,520
bathroom and it's awkward because you

245
00:09:47,200 --> 00:09:50,290
have to go through someone's bedroom to

246
00:09:48,520 --> 00:09:52,810
get to it right maybe you're gonna have

247
00:09:50,290 --> 00:09:54,280
to lose a whole room for this but if you

248
00:09:52,810 --> 00:09:55,479
had done this at the beginning you know

249
00:09:54,280 --> 00:09:56,890
you're mapping out the house and you're

250
00:09:55,480 --> 00:09:58,180
like you know what maybe we should get

251
00:09:56,890 --> 00:10:00,580
three bathrooms because we have so many

252
00:09:58,180 --> 00:10:02,020
people and then you could plan it it

253
00:10:00,580 --> 00:10:04,090
would be better it first of all would be

254
00:10:02,020 --> 00:10:06,310
way cheaper right your project would

255
00:10:04,090 --> 00:10:08,260
actually show up on time and it would be

256
00:10:06,310 --> 00:10:11,319
great the design would be good instead

257
00:10:08,260 --> 00:10:15,520
of duct tape on the side right so this

258
00:10:11,320 --> 00:10:17,560
is why we should push left so now you're

259
00:10:15,520 --> 00:10:19,300
probably like okay so we're going to

260
00:10:17,560 --> 00:10:21,910
push left so what is this like a boss

261
00:10:19,300 --> 00:10:24,819
part if you want to push left like a

262
00:10:21,910 --> 00:10:26,800
boss in my opinion you need to start an

263
00:10:24,820 --> 00:10:29,410
application security program you need to

264
00:10:26,800 --> 00:10:33,219
formalize your steps so let's talk about

265
00:10:29,410 --> 00:10:35,630
when application security program can be

266
00:10:33,220 --> 00:10:38,720
so I really like food I guess I've

267
00:10:35,630 --> 00:10:42,410
already mentioned food once so far so I

268
00:10:38,720 --> 00:10:45,589
organized my slides into food so that

269
00:10:42,410 --> 00:10:47,060
you understand what I mean so in the

270
00:10:45,589 --> 00:10:48,920
following slide I'm gonna explain to

271
00:10:47,060 --> 00:10:50,989
what I feel the main courses the things

272
00:10:48,920 --> 00:10:53,719
that you should be able to do if you

273
00:10:50,990 --> 00:10:55,640
have a formal AB SEC program if you work

274
00:10:53,720 --> 00:10:57,020
somewhere and it's a smaller place you

275
00:10:55,640 --> 00:10:59,270
know you only have ten people on your

276
00:10:57,020 --> 00:11:01,040
whole IT shop maybe you can't do all of

277
00:10:59,270 --> 00:11:03,230
this maybe you need to hire out

278
00:11:01,040 --> 00:11:04,849
sometimes you don't need to do all these

279
00:11:03,230 --> 00:11:06,470
steps for every single app but if you

280
00:11:04,850 --> 00:11:07,940
work in an enterprise I really feel you

281
00:11:06,470 --> 00:11:10,339
should have the capability to do these

282
00:11:07,940 --> 00:11:12,860
things or hire out for these things when

283
00:11:10,339 --> 00:11:16,970
it's important so let's look at the main

284
00:11:12,860 --> 00:11:20,390
the main tours Bulmer ability

285
00:11:16,970 --> 00:11:22,580
assessments and scans so I would like to

286
00:11:20,390 --> 00:11:25,730
explain right now that a vulnerability

287
00:11:22,580 --> 00:11:28,250
scan is not the same as a vulnerability

288
00:11:25,730 --> 00:11:30,890
assessment and I've had to fight this a

289
00:11:28,250 --> 00:11:32,540
lot in my city where they're like oh

290
00:11:30,890 --> 00:11:34,430
could you just go to a VA in the next

291
00:11:32,540 --> 00:11:35,839
hour like do you want me to run a scan

292
00:11:34,430 --> 00:11:37,819
is that what you're asking for because I

293
00:11:35,839 --> 00:11:39,500
can run a scan in the next 20 minutes

294
00:11:37,820 --> 00:11:42,920
for you but if you want a vulnerability

295
00:11:39,500 --> 00:11:44,810
assessment I mean I need some time so a

296
00:11:42,920 --> 00:11:46,699
vulnerability scanner is an automated

297
00:11:44,810 --> 00:11:48,489
tool that will go and find all the

298
00:11:46,700 --> 00:11:51,230
low-hanging fruit for you in your app

299
00:11:48,490 --> 00:11:53,750
but it won't find logic flaws it won't

300
00:11:51,230 --> 00:11:56,470
find weird obscure things people

301
00:11:53,750 --> 00:12:00,500
estimate that finds around 30% of

302
00:11:56,470 --> 00:12:02,930
problems you need to fix all of those

303
00:12:00,500 --> 00:12:05,209
things because vulnerability scanners

304
00:12:02,930 --> 00:12:08,300
are really really easy to use and that

305
00:12:05,209 --> 00:12:10,699
means any idiot can find it in your app

306
00:12:08,300 --> 00:12:12,560
so you need to find it and then fix it

307
00:12:10,700 --> 00:12:14,149
well vulnerability assessment is where

308
00:12:12,560 --> 00:12:15,739
you need to use your noggin you need

309
00:12:14,149 --> 00:12:18,200
someone with some security experience

310
00:12:15,740 --> 00:12:19,640
and background to go through each of the

311
00:12:18,200 --> 00:12:21,290
different things in your app to make

312
00:12:19,640 --> 00:12:22,850
sure all the security controls that are

313
00:12:21,290 --> 00:12:24,829
supposed to be there are there and that

314
00:12:22,850 --> 00:12:27,230
they work correctly to make sure it's

315
00:12:24,829 --> 00:12:28,489
the business logic can't be abused so

316
00:12:27,230 --> 00:12:29,029
that's doing the opposite of what it

317
00:12:28,490 --> 00:12:31,610
should be

318
00:12:29,029 --> 00:12:33,350
etc threat modeling

319
00:12:31,610 --> 00:12:35,120
I'm gonna go into each one of these a

320
00:12:33,350 --> 00:12:38,480
little bit more as we continue the talk

321
00:12:35,120 --> 00:12:41,149
but threat modeling in my opinion for

322
00:12:38,480 --> 00:12:43,100
developers anyway is a brainstorming

323
00:12:41,149 --> 00:12:44,660
session between security developers and

324
00:12:43,100 --> 00:12:46,250
the business about what the risks are

325
00:12:44,660 --> 00:12:47,360
that face your application and how you

326
00:12:46,250 --> 00:12:49,579
can make sure that you've defended

327
00:12:47,360 --> 00:12:53,320
against them we'll get into this a bit

328
00:12:49,579 --> 00:12:57,019
more oh wait wait

329
00:12:53,320 --> 00:12:59,269
secure code reviews and or static code

330
00:12:57,019 --> 00:13:01,850
analysis so secure code review is a

331
00:12:59,269 --> 00:13:03,589
manual type of effort and it can be

332
00:13:01,850 --> 00:13:05,630
coupled with static code analysis which

333
00:13:03,589 --> 00:13:07,250
is an automated effort where it purses

334
00:13:05,630 --> 00:13:10,339
through your app and finds things that

335
00:13:07,250 --> 00:13:12,620
things might be a problem code review is

336
00:13:10,339 --> 00:13:13,970
important I know that it's not fun it's

337
00:13:12,620 --> 00:13:17,360
not going to make me popular to say but

338
00:13:13,970 --> 00:13:19,880
it's really really important for quality

339
00:13:17,360 --> 00:13:23,029
and the last one is penetration tests

340
00:13:19,880 --> 00:13:24,470
which again are not quite like a VA a

341
00:13:23,029 --> 00:13:26,510
vulnerability assessment you're going to

342
00:13:24,470 --> 00:13:27,829
find what the vulnerabilities are but

343
00:13:26,510 --> 00:13:29,569
with the penetration tests you want to

344
00:13:27,829 --> 00:13:30,680
exploit them you want to see how far you

345
00:13:29,570 --> 00:13:32,209
can get you want to see if you can

346
00:13:30,680 --> 00:13:33,979
actually steal all the stuff from the

347
00:13:32,209 --> 00:13:36,680
database but with a VA I'm just like I

348
00:13:33,980 --> 00:13:38,779
injected some SQL I paused your database

349
00:13:36,680 --> 00:13:40,099
I'm sure that this worked I don't need

350
00:13:38,779 --> 00:13:41,660
to seal the crap I can get in the

351
00:13:40,100 --> 00:13:42,800
damaged I can do it prove there's a

352
00:13:41,660 --> 00:13:44,930
problem let's just fix it

353
00:13:42,800 --> 00:13:46,670
penetration testing is so great if you

354
00:13:44,930 --> 00:13:49,489
want to shock management into agreeing

355
00:13:46,670 --> 00:13:51,949
to sign things for you there is nothing

356
00:13:49,490 --> 00:13:53,720
like sending a proof of concept like I

357
00:13:51,949 --> 00:13:55,640
have definitely sent an email before

358
00:13:53,720 --> 00:13:58,760
click on this link boss you've won an

359
00:13:55,640 --> 00:14:00,800
iPad and then it might prove of concept

360
00:13:58,760 --> 00:14:02,689
is in there it's not a good way to get

361
00:14:00,800 --> 00:14:04,160
popular make friends but it is a good

362
00:14:02,690 --> 00:14:07,910
way to bring attention to why you need

363
00:14:04,160 --> 00:14:11,329
some changes in your organization all of

364
00:14:07,910 --> 00:14:13,760
these things apply to not only custom

365
00:14:11,329 --> 00:14:15,920
homemade apps but it applies to cots

366
00:14:13,760 --> 00:14:18,800
products so if you're gonna do this huge

367
00:14:15,920 --> 00:14:20,300
implementation of SharePoint awesome you

368
00:14:18,800 --> 00:14:22,099
should test it and make sure it's

369
00:14:20,300 --> 00:14:24,019
properly hardened because just because

370
00:14:22,100 --> 00:14:26,240
the product is good does not mean all

371
00:14:24,019 --> 00:14:30,140
the things you did to it it's still good

372
00:14:26,240 --> 00:14:30,790
right so please don't think because it

373
00:14:30,140 --> 00:14:33,579
came from

374
00:14:30,790 --> 00:14:35,380
like an awesome company that it's always

375
00:14:33,579 --> 00:14:37,540
bulletproof you definitely want to check

376
00:14:35,380 --> 00:14:39,639
that it was put in the right way and

377
00:14:37,540 --> 00:14:43,980
changes haven't been made that are

378
00:14:39,639 --> 00:14:47,529
damaging okay so who knows what this is

379
00:14:43,980 --> 00:14:51,730
this is the Canadian national dish yes

380
00:14:47,529 --> 00:14:54,490
it's pitting so this is we take hot

381
00:14:51,730 --> 00:14:56,410
fries and then we put cheese curds in it

382
00:14:54,490 --> 00:14:58,510
and we pour hot gravy so that melts the

383
00:14:56,410 --> 00:15:02,639
cheese curds into the fries so that you

384
00:14:58,510 --> 00:15:05,380
can have 3000 calories in just one city

385
00:15:02,639 --> 00:15:07,060
it's so delicious I really like it it's

386
00:15:05,380 --> 00:15:10,449
a really good on a cold day we have to

387
00:15:07,060 --> 00:15:14,529
put on weight and winter will die but

388
00:15:10,449 --> 00:15:16,060
seriously I will I love gravy and so

389
00:15:14,529 --> 00:15:18,730
these are extra things that you can add

390
00:15:16,060 --> 00:15:19,779
to your application security program so

391
00:15:18,730 --> 00:15:24,570
that's even better

392
00:15:19,779 --> 00:15:27,250
right so above above just the main stuff

393
00:15:24,570 --> 00:15:29,860
so you could start a developer education

394
00:15:27,250 --> 00:15:31,660
program right like if you have a

395
00:15:29,860 --> 00:15:33,279
knapsack team with five people maybe one

396
00:15:31,660 --> 00:15:36,069
of you doesn't mind public speaking or

397
00:15:33,279 --> 00:15:37,569
is willing to endure it right give

398
00:15:36,069 --> 00:15:39,389
lessons on things that there are

399
00:15:37,569 --> 00:15:42,250
problems with like we heard this morning

400
00:15:39,389 --> 00:15:43,779
if you could get some metrics on what's

401
00:15:42,250 --> 00:15:45,190
going wrong like if you see a law of

402
00:15:43,779 --> 00:15:47,230
cross-site scripting do a deep dive into

403
00:15:45,190 --> 00:15:49,930
cross-site scripting it's awesome they

404
00:15:47,230 --> 00:15:51,579
will definitely appreciate it right you

405
00:15:49,930 --> 00:15:53,349
can also do like workshops on things

406
00:15:51,579 --> 00:15:55,660
bring people in for lunch and learns

407
00:15:53,350 --> 00:15:57,100
just educate your developers some of

408
00:15:55,660 --> 00:15:59,050
them won't show up but some of them will

409
00:15:57,100 --> 00:15:59,850
and it's so great when you get their

410
00:15:59,050 --> 00:16:02,180
attention

411
00:15:59,850 --> 00:16:05,930
you can also do

412
00:16:02,180 --> 00:16:08,319
secure coding standards so tell them

413
00:16:05,930 --> 00:16:11,030
what you want tell them what you need

414
00:16:08,320 --> 00:16:12,320
tell them what you expect from them you

415
00:16:11,030 --> 00:16:15,020
know like if you're if your app has a

416
00:16:12,320 --> 00:16:16,970
file upload here's the list of things I

417
00:16:15,020 --> 00:16:19,550
expect from you you know first you need

418
00:16:16,970 --> 00:16:22,150
to obviously scan it from malware I

419
00:16:19,550 --> 00:16:26,030
don't know if you saw but the Canadian

420
00:16:22,150 --> 00:16:28,699
government released a free tool to scan

421
00:16:26,030 --> 00:16:30,800
your files from malware and then they

422
00:16:28,700 --> 00:16:32,270
take a sample and add it to our base so

423
00:16:30,800 --> 00:16:34,520
that we can warn other people about it

424
00:16:32,270 --> 00:16:36,199
it's free it's called assembly-line if

425
00:16:34,520 --> 00:16:37,370
you want to try it so if you're if

426
00:16:36,200 --> 00:16:38,780
you're gonna upload it to something

427
00:16:37,370 --> 00:16:40,370
maybe you should scan it with that right

428
00:16:38,780 --> 00:16:42,260
and if you have a paid product scan it

429
00:16:40,370 --> 00:16:44,420
with both like make sure it's okay and

430
00:16:42,260 --> 00:16:46,760
the list goes on file uploads are risky

431
00:16:44,420 --> 00:16:49,459
risky business but tell them what you

432
00:16:46,760 --> 00:16:54,350
expect from them and then you might do

433
00:16:49,460 --> 00:16:57,890
it responsible or coordinated disclosure

434
00:16:54,350 --> 00:17:00,440
program I know a lot of places do really

435
00:16:57,890 --> 00:17:03,020
really fancy versions of this but in my

436
00:17:00,440 --> 00:17:04,640
opinion this is a lot like the the thing

437
00:17:03,020 --> 00:17:07,579
in airports where they say if you see

438
00:17:04,640 --> 00:17:09,770
something say something right so give

439
00:17:07,579 --> 00:17:12,470
the public and give your employees

440
00:17:09,770 --> 00:17:14,720
especially a place to report security

441
00:17:12,470 --> 00:17:16,370
issues right give them just an email

442
00:17:14,720 --> 00:17:19,190
address if you find a problem please

443
00:17:16,369 --> 00:17:22,119
send it to us great and then make sure

444
00:17:19,190 --> 00:17:24,410
you read it and you look into the things

445
00:17:22,119 --> 00:17:27,708
90% of the things that are reported are

446
00:17:24,410 --> 00:17:30,260
gonna be crap this is the fact or it

447
00:17:27,709 --> 00:17:31,790
won't make sense and you'll you'll feel

448
00:17:30,260 --> 00:17:34,520
like you're wasting time but that's 10%

449
00:17:31,790 --> 00:17:36,260
where someone's like oh by the way I saw

450
00:17:34,520 --> 00:17:40,760
your data for sale on the dark web for

451
00:17:36,260 --> 00:17:43,100
$50 it's really good to know these

452
00:17:40,760 --> 00:17:45,500
things right and if you don't have a way

453
00:17:43,100 --> 00:17:47,449
for them to report it to you people will

454
00:17:45,500 --> 00:17:50,960
do things like send it to your info at

455
00:17:47,450 --> 00:17:52,130
your company name dot whatever and those

456
00:17:50,960 --> 00:17:53,270
people will look at it and not

457
00:17:52,130 --> 00:17:54,980
understand what it is and probably

458
00:17:53,270 --> 00:17:58,220
delete it probably won't get to you or

459
00:17:54,980 --> 00:18:00,170
it will in six months or they'll post it

460
00:17:58,220 --> 00:18:02,510
on Twitter or reddit or someplace like

461
00:18:00,170 --> 00:18:03,710
that and embarrass your company there's

462
00:18:02,510 --> 00:18:05,029
so many

463
00:18:03,710 --> 00:18:06,890
different things and I would so much

464
00:18:05,029 --> 00:18:10,640
rather someone tell me instead of

465
00:18:06,890 --> 00:18:13,250
telling the media so I can fix it the

466
00:18:10,640 --> 00:18:15,770
last one here is creating a secure code

467
00:18:13,250 --> 00:18:17,960
library and or other reference materials

468
00:18:15,770 --> 00:18:20,809
or creating custom tools for your

469
00:18:17,960 --> 00:18:23,330
developers I I heard about this app set

470
00:18:20,809 --> 00:18:24,889
Kali this guy was talking about how they

471
00:18:23,330 --> 00:18:27,289
didn't want people to use the md5 hash

472
00:18:24,890 --> 00:18:28,460
anymore because it's insecure so they

473
00:18:27,289 --> 00:18:30,169
put a wrapper on it

474
00:18:28,460 --> 00:18:33,440
so whenever a developer used it it would

475
00:18:30,169 --> 00:18:36,980
rename itself to really insecure md5

476
00:18:33,440 --> 00:18:41,980
hash function usage went down by 95

477
00:18:36,980 --> 00:18:41,980
percent just being passive-aggressive

478
00:18:43,899 --> 00:18:48,408
I've worked at places where we make a

479
00:18:46,190 --> 00:18:50,169
secure templates oh it's so great I

480
00:18:48,409 --> 00:18:52,399
didn't have to think I just used it and

481
00:18:50,169 --> 00:18:54,679
we had a secure coding library of

482
00:18:52,399 --> 00:18:56,959
snippets that were secure coding things

483
00:18:54,679 --> 00:18:58,730
that we'd already had pen tested really

484
00:18:56,960 --> 00:19:00,140
thoroughly examined so I know it's a if

485
00:18:58,730 --> 00:19:02,630
I could just yank it and drop into my

486
00:19:00,140 --> 00:19:04,370
code it was awesome sometimes I told

487
00:19:02,630 --> 00:19:05,630
security people about this and they're

488
00:19:04,370 --> 00:19:07,908
like great I'm gonna go in the code

489
00:19:05,630 --> 00:19:10,250
library and do this stuff and I would

490
00:19:07,909 --> 00:19:12,799
like to inform you that the code library

491
00:19:10,250 --> 00:19:15,409
is like a woman's purse you do not put

492
00:19:12,799 --> 00:19:17,870
your hands in it without permission it

493
00:19:15,409 --> 00:19:20,000
belongs to the developers so you need to

494
00:19:17,870 --> 00:19:22,250
ask them their permission to make an

495
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:23,809
area for you don't just be like we're

496
00:19:22,250 --> 00:19:25,730
gonna do this we're security this is

497
00:19:23,809 --> 00:19:27,889
gonna make you enemies it's a woman's

498
00:19:25,730 --> 00:19:29,570
purse you ask permission or ask them to

499
00:19:27,890 --> 00:19:31,370
put it in for you ask them to take care

500
00:19:29,570 --> 00:19:32,779
of it that's even better and then you

501
00:19:31,370 --> 00:19:35,209
can give them examples of things that

502
00:19:32,779 --> 00:19:38,899
you can put in it okay let's go on to

503
00:19:35,210 --> 00:19:41,510
the next slide this is the desert mmm

504
00:19:38,899 --> 00:19:43,370
this is extra special things for extra

505
00:19:41,510 --> 00:19:45,710
special situations they're not going to

506
00:19:43,370 --> 00:19:47,149
apply to everyone you might not get to a

507
00:19:45,710 --> 00:19:48,830
level where you need these things or you

508
00:19:47,149 --> 00:19:51,729
want these things but they exist and I

509
00:19:48,830 --> 00:19:51,730
want you to know what

510
00:19:51,840 --> 00:19:59,679
so one bug bounty programs so we hear a

511
00:19:58,030 --> 00:20:00,930
lot about this and I want to make sure

512
00:19:59,680 --> 00:20:05,110
everyone knows what it is

513
00:20:00,930 --> 00:20:07,510
so who here seen one of those many many

514
00:20:05,110 --> 00:20:11,919
many Hollywood movies or TV shows where

515
00:20:07,510 --> 00:20:13,840
the people escaped from jail and but

516
00:20:11,920 --> 00:20:15,850
bounty hunters go chase them down grab

517
00:20:13,840 --> 00:20:18,429
them bring them back and then they get

518
00:20:15,850 --> 00:20:21,399
money they get a bounty this is kind of

519
00:20:18,430 --> 00:20:24,490
like that but for security bugs so you

520
00:20:21,400 --> 00:20:27,490
essentially allow hackers to hack a test

521
00:20:24,490 --> 00:20:28,780
version of your site and they report all

522
00:20:27,490 --> 00:20:30,460
the things they find to you and if they

523
00:20:28,780 --> 00:20:31,899
find something and no one else has found

524
00:20:30,460 --> 00:20:36,790
it yet you pay them and you say thank

525
00:20:31,900 --> 00:20:40,120
you instead of suing them big companies

526
00:20:36,790 --> 00:20:42,190
like Microsoft like Google like Shopify

527
00:20:40,120 --> 00:20:44,560
from Canada they run their own bug

528
00:20:42,190 --> 00:20:46,570
bounty programs they're huge and they

529
00:20:44,560 --> 00:20:48,820
can do that a lot of smaller places you

530
00:20:46,570 --> 00:20:51,580
hire someone like bugcrowd hacker one

531
00:20:48,820 --> 00:20:54,280
and they'll run all this for you they

532
00:20:51,580 --> 00:20:57,129
will reduce a lot of the noise do triage

533
00:20:54,280 --> 00:20:59,290
it's fantastic not everyone needs this

534
00:20:57,130 --> 00:21:00,940
right not everyone needs to have this

535
00:20:59,290 --> 00:21:03,280
level of security but if you want to

536
00:21:00,940 --> 00:21:06,280
have 20,000 hackers look at your

537
00:21:03,280 --> 00:21:08,200
application this is a really amazing way

538
00:21:06,280 --> 00:21:09,850
to do it although I would advise unless

539
00:21:08,200 --> 00:21:11,980
you have done all the other steps first

540
00:21:09,850 --> 00:21:15,370
this could be very expensive if you do

541
00:21:11,980 --> 00:21:17,800
it this way that's that's the end on bug

542
00:21:15,370 --> 00:21:19,689
bounties so the next one is my favorite

543
00:21:17,800 --> 00:21:23,080
thing ever capture the flight contests

544
00:21:19,690 --> 00:21:25,450
so this is like a hacker contest we put

545
00:21:23,080 --> 00:21:28,090
up a vulnerable system a whole bunch of

546
00:21:25,450 --> 00:21:30,400
people gather and they attack it as they

547
00:21:28,090 --> 00:21:32,860
solve security challenges or puzzles

548
00:21:30,400 --> 00:21:35,140
find vulnerabilities they get flags they

549
00:21:32,860 --> 00:21:36,429
turn these flags in they get points and

550
00:21:35,140 --> 00:21:39,970
whoever has the most points at the end

551
00:21:36,430 --> 00:21:43,540
wins this is in my opinion the absolute

552
00:21:39,970 --> 00:21:46,030
funnest way to learn about security

553
00:21:43,540 --> 00:21:48,010
I've ran these for my own chapter every

554
00:21:46,030 --> 00:21:49,090
year this is the first year that I'm not

555
00:21:48,010 --> 00:21:51,370
running and I've passed the

556
00:21:49,090 --> 00:21:52,659
rains off to my friend Jen it's so

557
00:21:51,370 --> 00:21:55,419
exciting is so fun

558
00:21:52,660 --> 00:21:57,070
III went to CTF and I made this

559
00:21:55,420 --> 00:21:58,330
all-female team and we went and I

560
00:21:57,070 --> 00:21:59,649
brought all these developers with me and

561
00:21:58,330 --> 00:22:02,139
I was showing them how to hack things

562
00:21:59,650 --> 00:22:03,970
and one of them you know the first time

563
00:22:02,140 --> 00:22:06,400
she got something she literally jumped

564
00:22:03,970 --> 00:22:09,250
up and she was screaming and dancing and

565
00:22:06,400 --> 00:22:10,540
our full team was really excited this is

566
00:22:09,250 --> 00:22:14,470
what happens when a bigger full women

567
00:22:10,540 --> 00:22:19,330
get together we really didn't fit in at

568
00:22:14,470 --> 00:22:20,920
the event but that's okay if you ran one

569
00:22:19,330 --> 00:22:24,460
of these for the developers where you

570
00:22:20,920 --> 00:22:27,310
work you will get their attention when I

571
00:22:24,460 --> 00:22:29,830
showed all the developers on my team how

572
00:22:27,310 --> 00:22:32,919
to do SQL injection and get past the

573
00:22:29,830 --> 00:22:34,929
login screen I just blew their mind when

574
00:22:32,920 --> 00:22:39,310
I showed them you know with a web proxy

575
00:22:34,930 --> 00:22:41,530
you can just go right behind you can

576
00:22:39,310 --> 00:22:43,870
just go right behind all of the

577
00:22:41,530 --> 00:22:45,490
front-end validation and that means if

578
00:22:43,870 --> 00:22:48,189
you haven't revalidate on the server

579
00:22:45,490 --> 00:22:49,450
boom I'm in there just like oh my gosh

580
00:22:48,190 --> 00:22:52,420
I'm like do you need to run back to the

581
00:22:49,450 --> 00:22:54,130
office now it'sit's such a good way to

582
00:22:52,420 --> 00:22:55,750
learn and if you want to build better

583
00:22:54,130 --> 00:22:58,480
relationship with your developer team

584
00:22:55,750 --> 00:23:04,540
this is a great way and the last one is

585
00:22:58,480 --> 00:23:06,520
red team exercises so in Canada for the

586
00:23:04,540 --> 00:23:08,530
government we have a red team a lot of

587
00:23:06,520 --> 00:23:10,150
places like big teams they have big

588
00:23:08,530 --> 00:23:11,980
companies they have red team and what

589
00:23:10,150 --> 00:23:16,630
they do is they will attack your

590
00:23:11,980 --> 00:23:19,240
production applications during regular

591
00:23:16,630 --> 00:23:22,840
hours or off hours but they'll attack

592
00:23:19,240 --> 00:23:24,010
your real systems and they won't

593
00:23:22,840 --> 00:23:26,649
necessarily tell you what they're gonna

594
00:23:24,010 --> 00:23:28,900
do like there's some scope but they will

595
00:23:26,650 --> 00:23:31,450
attack you so that you can see how

596
00:23:28,900 --> 00:23:33,910
resilient you really are instead of the

597
00:23:31,450 --> 00:23:36,550
paper exercises like threat modeling you

598
00:23:33,910 --> 00:23:38,590
now have facts right so sometimes people

599
00:23:36,550 --> 00:23:40,540
hire out a team to come in and test and

600
00:23:38,590 --> 00:23:42,250
the reason why they do this is so that

601
00:23:40,540 --> 00:23:43,840
they know where they stand like if you

602
00:23:42,250 --> 00:23:45,640
hire a red team in three days later

603
00:23:43,840 --> 00:23:47,709
they're like we got nothing like you're

604
00:23:45,640 --> 00:23:48,880
doing great but if you hire a red team

605
00:23:47,710 --> 00:23:49,930
and five minutes later they're like

606
00:23:48,880 --> 00:23:52,450
would you like to know your password

607
00:23:49,930 --> 00:23:53,610
because I know it you need to make a lot

608
00:23:52,450 --> 00:23:57,360
of changes

609
00:23:53,610 --> 00:23:59,310
and this is a real this is a way of

610
00:23:57,360 --> 00:24:01,469
knowing what's actually happening within

611
00:23:59,310 --> 00:24:02,960
your network they'll definitely go for

612
00:24:01,470 --> 00:24:04,860
your legacy apps first just so you know

613
00:24:02,960 --> 00:24:06,330
you definitely want to make sure that's

614
00:24:04,860 --> 00:24:08,189
all cleaned up before you hire a bunch

615
00:24:06,330 --> 00:24:15,870
of people to do this how am i doing for

616
00:24:08,190 --> 00:24:17,010
time 20 minutes oh good yes okay so I'm

617
00:24:15,870 --> 00:24:18,810
hoping by this point in the presentation

618
00:24:17,010 --> 00:24:20,250
all of you are like oh my gosh this is

619
00:24:18,810 --> 00:24:23,550
amazing I want to push left please

620
00:24:20,250 --> 00:24:25,250
please tell me how good cuz that's what

621
00:24:23,550 --> 00:24:27,470
the rest of the presentation is about a

622
00:24:25,250 --> 00:24:30,060
bunch of these things I'm gonna give

623
00:24:27,470 --> 00:24:31,890
might seem like they're things that

624
00:24:30,060 --> 00:24:33,480
developers need to do but these are all

625
00:24:31,890 --> 00:24:36,600
things that as security people

626
00:24:33,480 --> 00:24:39,180
you can enable developers to do because

627
00:24:36,600 --> 00:24:41,790
I believe the security team is meant to

628
00:24:39,180 --> 00:24:44,520
enable the rest of the the rest of all

629
00:24:41,790 --> 00:24:46,350
of IT to do their jobs securely right

630
00:24:44,520 --> 00:24:49,139
that's our job is to enable the business

631
00:24:46,350 --> 00:24:51,870
in this case developers to get their

632
00:24:49,140 --> 00:24:55,530
jobs done securely and do them at the

633
00:24:51,870 --> 00:24:59,250
end have security so how can we push

634
00:24:55,530 --> 00:25:00,899
left you can test your code so if you're

635
00:24:59,250 --> 00:25:02,340
on the security team you can test code

636
00:25:00,900 --> 00:25:05,040
if you're a developer you can test code

637
00:25:02,340 --> 00:25:07,590
if you're on the security team you can

638
00:25:05,040 --> 00:25:09,600
make sure that there is time in the

639
00:25:07,590 --> 00:25:11,879
project for developers to do testing

640
00:25:09,600 --> 00:25:14,820
during the development phase and again

641
00:25:11,880 --> 00:25:17,040
at the end you can give so how many

642
00:25:14,820 --> 00:25:20,070
people here have taken security tools

643
00:25:17,040 --> 00:25:23,250
away from developers yeah you're not

644
00:25:20,070 --> 00:25:24,870
raising your hands I have had the

645
00:25:23,250 --> 00:25:27,600
security to you so many times try to

646
00:25:24,870 --> 00:25:29,280
take my tools away instead of trying to

647
00:25:27,600 --> 00:25:30,570
take tools away what if we give them to

648
00:25:29,280 --> 00:25:32,280
them and train them how to use them

649
00:25:30,570 --> 00:25:35,970
properly and give them safe places to

650
00:25:32,280 --> 00:25:37,680
use them this is my opinion so if you're

651
00:25:35,970 --> 00:25:40,410
gonna do security testing on a web app

652
00:25:37,680 --> 00:25:42,030
you can get a web proxy you can get an

653
00:25:40,410 --> 00:25:42,570
automated scanning tool there's free

654
00:25:42,030 --> 00:25:44,610
ones

655
00:25:42,570 --> 00:25:46,470
there's not free ones there's cheap ones

656
00:25:44,610 --> 00:25:48,389
there's expensive ones there's ones that

657
00:25:46,470 --> 00:25:50,910
are absolutely you don't need any skill

658
00:25:48,390 --> 00:25:52,800
to run and you will get a smaller amount

659
00:25:50,910 --> 00:25:55,110
of things and there's ones that are much

660
00:25:52,800 --> 00:25:56,590
more complicated to run definitely need

661
00:25:55,110 --> 00:25:58,570
a human with lots of

662
00:25:56,590 --> 00:26:01,240
but they will find everything with it

663
00:25:58,570 --> 00:26:03,129
right the way it works is it sits

664
00:26:01,240 --> 00:26:05,380
between your browser and your

665
00:26:03,130 --> 00:26:07,450
application and everything goes through

666
00:26:05,380 --> 00:26:10,090
this proxy and it listens and it plans

667
00:26:07,450 --> 00:26:12,610
its attacks and scripts that's going to

668
00:26:10,090 --> 00:26:13,990
use against your app and it makes a

669
00:26:12,610 --> 00:26:17,560
report for you of things that it's found

670
00:26:13,990 --> 00:26:20,020
right if if we could enable developers

671
00:26:17,560 --> 00:26:21,220
to use these things so where the

672
00:26:20,020 --> 00:26:22,510
security team we have all the power I

673
00:26:21,220 --> 00:26:25,870
don't know if you know that but we have

674
00:26:22,510 --> 00:26:27,460
a lot of power and if we tell the

675
00:26:25,870 --> 00:26:29,199
business this is a thing that we need if

676
00:26:27,460 --> 00:26:31,960
we can get developers scanning during

677
00:26:29,200 --> 00:26:34,950
the development phase by the time it

678
00:26:31,960 --> 00:26:36,780
gets to us it will be so much better

679
00:26:34,950 --> 00:26:39,760
caution

680
00:26:36,780 --> 00:26:41,200
security scanners can cause damage so

681
00:26:39,760 --> 00:26:42,520
when you give developers these tools

682
00:26:41,200 --> 00:26:44,620
when you give some time you need to

683
00:26:42,520 --> 00:26:46,980
train them you need to make sure that

684
00:26:44,620 --> 00:26:49,840
they understand that you know if they

685
00:26:46,980 --> 00:26:52,540
they come in at 9:00 and then they set

686
00:26:49,840 --> 00:26:54,370
zap at insane mode and point it at their

687
00:26:52,540 --> 00:26:56,139
dev server and then they go get a cup of

688
00:26:54,370 --> 00:26:58,239
coffee they've just essentially DDoS

689
00:26:56,140 --> 00:26:59,890
their whole team and they're not going

690
00:26:58,240 --> 00:27:02,860
to be popular right so you want to make

691
00:26:59,890 --> 00:27:06,190
sure that they use them properly so that

692
00:27:02,860 --> 00:27:07,990
your name isn't mud so another thing we

693
00:27:06,190 --> 00:27:10,510
can do is threat modeling so you can get

694
00:27:07,990 --> 00:27:13,090
really in depth with bat modeling you

695
00:27:10,510 --> 00:27:16,150
can do attack trees you can do so many

696
00:27:13,090 --> 00:27:18,189
huge things and I know all the threat

697
00:27:16,150 --> 00:27:19,780
modelers that I know want to go in-depth

698
00:27:18,190 --> 00:27:21,730
and they get really upset with me when I

699
00:27:19,780 --> 00:27:23,129
say this but it doesn't have to be that

700
00:27:21,730 --> 00:27:25,600
complicated if you don't want it to be

701
00:27:23,130 --> 00:27:27,580
great if your company's never done

702
00:27:25,600 --> 00:27:29,679
threat modeling before just start with a

703
00:27:27,580 --> 00:27:31,570
meeting with the business and the

704
00:27:29,680 --> 00:27:34,030
developers and security and just have a

705
00:27:31,570 --> 00:27:35,409
chat explain I want to know what you

706
00:27:34,030 --> 00:27:36,910
think the risks are like if you were

707
00:27:35,410 --> 00:27:40,060
gonna attack your app how would you do

708
00:27:36,910 --> 00:27:42,730
it right if the business like what are

709
00:27:40,060 --> 00:27:44,678
you worried about like what could happen

710
00:27:42,730 --> 00:27:47,019
wrong like if there's a let's

711
00:27:44,679 --> 00:27:48,460
an email money transfer application you

712
00:27:47,019 --> 00:27:49,720
know what could go wrong what would what

713
00:27:48,460 --> 00:27:50,110
are the risks well people want to steal

714
00:27:49,720 --> 00:27:52,980
the money

715
00:27:50,110 --> 00:27:55,869
right that's obvious right but what ways

716
00:27:52,980 --> 00:27:58,090
right like if I can transfer you money

717
00:27:55,869 --> 00:27:59,649
can I transfer your negative money can I

718
00:27:58,090 --> 00:28:02,559
transfer you like a trillion dollars I

719
00:27:59,649 --> 00:28:04,719
don't have when you talk this out take

720
00:28:02,559 --> 00:28:08,350
notes then go make sure it's not

721
00:28:04,720 --> 00:28:10,299
possible so here's all of that again

722
00:28:08,350 --> 00:28:11,918
sometimes I talk through the picture

723
00:28:10,299 --> 00:28:13,720
because I don't want people to read

724
00:28:11,919 --> 00:28:16,659
while I'm talking because I can only do

725
00:28:13,720 --> 00:28:17,919
one at the same time listen or read but

726
00:28:16,659 --> 00:28:19,210
this is you know then you can take a

727
00:28:17,919 --> 00:28:20,559
picture of the slide if you want I'm

728
00:28:19,210 --> 00:28:22,539
gonna share all these slides after on

729
00:28:20,559 --> 00:28:24,639
Twitter immediately they're actually

730
00:28:22,539 --> 00:28:26,230
already on the net if you want them I

731
00:28:24,639 --> 00:28:28,119
always share everything it's my pleasure

732
00:28:26,230 --> 00:28:33,940
to do so so feel free to take pictures

733
00:28:28,119 --> 00:28:37,720
or grab them later reviewing your code

734
00:28:33,940 --> 00:28:39,879
so do you see this woman do you see how

735
00:28:37,720 --> 00:28:42,340
chilled out she looks she looks serene

736
00:28:39,879 --> 00:28:46,080
she looks confident it's because someone

737
00:28:42,340 --> 00:28:48,330
reviewed her code she knows that's good

738
00:28:46,080 --> 00:28:51,720
so

739
00:28:48,330 --> 00:28:53,189
I think reviewing code is important when

740
00:28:51,720 --> 00:28:55,169
you review someone else's code and you

741
00:28:53,190 --> 00:28:57,960
see a mistake they made is unlikely you

742
00:28:55,169 --> 00:28:59,429
will ever make that mistake again if

743
00:28:57,960 --> 00:29:01,169
someone points out a mistake to you that

744
00:28:59,429 --> 00:29:02,370
they found again likely you're not going

745
00:29:01,169 --> 00:29:05,610
to make that mistake again

746
00:29:02,370 --> 00:29:07,139
I tell developers that a secure code

747
00:29:05,610 --> 00:29:09,000
review is so much better than a regular

748
00:29:07,140 --> 00:29:11,880
code review because you only have to

749
00:29:09,000 --> 00:29:13,740
worry about the security parts I don't

750
00:29:11,880 --> 00:29:15,390
know if that sells it better but

751
00:29:13,740 --> 00:29:16,919
basically you want to look through your

752
00:29:15,390 --> 00:29:18,240
application and look at all the places

753
00:29:16,919 --> 00:29:20,639
they're supposed to be something to do

754
00:29:18,240 --> 00:29:21,929
with security and then make sure that

755
00:29:20,639 --> 00:29:24,779
it's there make sure it's working

756
00:29:21,929 --> 00:29:27,330
properly right have someone else look at

757
00:29:24,779 --> 00:29:28,830
it you also want to look for your threat

758
00:29:27,330 --> 00:29:30,570
models so remember that meeting that you

759
00:29:28,830 --> 00:29:32,428
just had with the security team and the

760
00:29:30,570 --> 00:29:33,689
business and the developers go look and

761
00:29:32,429 --> 00:29:36,029
see if those things are possible

762
00:29:33,690 --> 00:29:38,760
right like you can find a lot of things

763
00:29:36,029 --> 00:29:40,440
with with your eyes looking at the code

764
00:29:38,760 --> 00:29:42,299
that you can't find with dynamic

765
00:29:40,440 --> 00:29:47,279
analysis and vice-versa so I think

766
00:29:42,299 --> 00:29:49,049
they're both important there you can use

767
00:29:47,279 --> 00:29:51,510
static code analysis which are these big

768
00:29:49,049 --> 00:29:53,429
tools by many of the companies that are

769
00:29:51,510 --> 00:29:57,090
here today thank you for making those

770
00:29:53,429 --> 00:29:59,610
makes code review a lot less painful and

771
00:29:57,090 --> 00:30:00,840
it purses out the app and looks at all

772
00:29:59,610 --> 00:30:02,189
the different things and then gives you

773
00:30:00,840 --> 00:30:04,590
hints as to where it thinks there are

774
00:30:02,190 --> 00:30:06,139
problems I feel there's a bit of a

775
00:30:04,590 --> 00:30:08,279
problem with static code analysis tools

776
00:30:06,139 --> 00:30:10,529
not with the tools itself but the fact

777
00:30:08,279 --> 00:30:12,210
that after management bought it they're

778
00:30:10,529 --> 00:30:13,769
like oh well just you press the button

779
00:30:12,210 --> 00:30:15,720
and then you have all the answers right

780
00:30:13,769 --> 00:30:19,049
so you just press the button what's

781
00:30:15,720 --> 00:30:20,340
taking so long like oh it's not it's not

782
00:30:19,049 --> 00:30:22,710
telling you the answers it's giving you

783
00:30:20,340 --> 00:30:25,139
hints it's telling you we you know

784
00:30:22,710 --> 00:30:27,360
there's 20,000 lines of code we found

785
00:30:25,139 --> 00:30:28,500
what we think could be 200 things and

786
00:30:27,360 --> 00:30:30,418
then you review them and then you

787
00:30:28,500 --> 00:30:32,789
actually found 20 things and

788
00:30:30,419 --> 00:30:34,379
20 things I'm like this is great instead

789
00:30:32,789 --> 00:30:36,899
of reviewing 20,000 lines now I'm

790
00:30:34,379 --> 00:30:38,549
reviewing 200 lines this is awesome but

791
00:30:36,899 --> 00:30:39,359
in the meantime management's like this

792
00:30:38,549 --> 00:30:42,259
tool sucks

793
00:30:39,359 --> 00:30:45,600
it gave us 90% false positives like no

794
00:30:42,259 --> 00:30:46,799
Oh anyway so you might want to explain

795
00:30:45,600 --> 00:30:48,600
that to management when you get this

796
00:30:46,799 --> 00:30:51,239
that it is not the Silver Bullet that

797
00:30:48,600 --> 00:30:54,629
makes security happen it is a thing that

798
00:30:51,239 --> 00:30:58,830
helps you get there okay so this is the

799
00:30:54,629 --> 00:31:01,619
picture slide and next okay so this

800
00:30:58,830 --> 00:31:03,749
slide I've had some people tell me that

801
00:31:01,619 --> 00:31:05,789
it feels a little condescending well you

802
00:31:03,749 --> 00:31:08,970
could just write better code that's not

803
00:31:05,789 --> 00:31:11,460
what I mean if you see a professional

804
00:31:08,970 --> 00:31:14,340
athlete do you think of that person

805
00:31:11,460 --> 00:31:15,899
after they practice they go back to

806
00:31:14,340 --> 00:31:17,459
their host they sit on the sofa put

807
00:31:15,899 --> 00:31:19,699
their feet up they eat Cheetos and watch

808
00:31:17,460 --> 00:31:24,090
TV for the next four days no they do not

809
00:31:19,700 --> 00:31:26,429
the best people on their teams they

810
00:31:24,090 --> 00:31:28,259
practice they watch themselves to make

811
00:31:26,429 --> 00:31:29,970
sure they can do better they experiment

812
00:31:28,259 --> 00:31:32,429
with new diets new different ways of

813
00:31:29,970 --> 00:31:34,320
doing everything new tools new they talk

814
00:31:32,429 --> 00:31:36,389
to experts in the field they ask other

815
00:31:34,320 --> 00:31:38,489
people's opinion they continue to

816
00:31:36,389 --> 00:31:40,199
perfect themselves and you can do that

817
00:31:38,489 --> 00:31:42,869
too no matter how good you are at coding

818
00:31:40,200 --> 00:31:44,909
you could still always do better and if

819
00:31:42,869 --> 00:31:47,428
you have made an app and it is beautiful

820
00:31:44,909 --> 00:31:49,559
it's fast it's efficient it's everything

821
00:31:47,429 --> 00:31:52,009
the client asked for but I can get into

822
00:31:49,559 --> 00:31:54,928
it in ten minutes it's not the best

823
00:31:52,009 --> 00:31:57,700
right so let's talk about doing even

824
00:31:54,929 --> 00:32:00,370
better you can

825
00:31:57,700 --> 00:32:01,690
trained yourself on secure coding I know

826
00:32:00,370 --> 00:32:04,389
this sounds hard but there are actually

827
00:32:01,690 --> 00:32:07,330
so many free tools online and free

828
00:32:04,390 --> 00:32:08,890
videos and all sorts of things I can't

829
00:32:07,330 --> 00:32:11,050
believe some of the stuff has given away

830
00:32:08,890 --> 00:32:12,880
for free and like this is so good

831
00:32:11,050 --> 00:32:14,169
there's paid stuff there's courses

832
00:32:12,880 --> 00:32:16,570
there's training there's all sorts of

833
00:32:14,170 --> 00:32:18,790
things you can do you can ask to do them

834
00:32:16,570 --> 00:32:21,460
right if you are a security team what

835
00:32:18,790 --> 00:32:23,800
you can do is you can provide this to

836
00:32:21,460 --> 00:32:25,330
the developers right like there's I

837
00:32:23,800 --> 00:32:27,100
don't want to name names but there's so

838
00:32:25,330 --> 00:32:28,449
many great trainings out there that you

839
00:32:27,100 --> 00:32:30,219
can either you can bring someone in they

840
00:32:28,450 --> 00:32:31,960
give the training you

841
00:32:30,220 --> 00:32:33,910
you can order like pure based training

842
00:32:31,960 --> 00:32:35,440
whatever provide this tool and

843
00:32:33,910 --> 00:32:37,120
developers might use it but make sure

844
00:32:35,440 --> 00:32:38,860
that their managers will actually give

845
00:32:37,120 --> 00:32:40,629
them like an hour a week to work on it

846
00:32:38,860 --> 00:32:41,979
it doesn't it doesn't work if you buy

847
00:32:40,630 --> 00:32:44,620
subscriptions for everyone and no one's

848
00:32:41,980 --> 00:32:46,870
actually allowed using it another thing

849
00:32:44,620 --> 00:32:49,629
so the so so this is the biggest thing

850
00:32:46,870 --> 00:32:52,270
so when I as a developer I'd be at my

851
00:32:49,630 --> 00:32:54,760
desk coding drinking coca-cola that's

852
00:32:52,270 --> 00:32:56,200
what I did and at some point I'd be like

853
00:32:54,760 --> 00:32:58,120
I forget how to do that I would

854
00:32:56,200 --> 00:33:00,220
immediately go to stack overflow we all

855
00:32:58,120 --> 00:33:01,780
do this all of us do this and then I

856
00:33:00,220 --> 00:33:03,580
would look up how to do whatever the

857
00:33:01,780 --> 00:33:05,020
thing is and then whatever the top thing

858
00:33:03,580 --> 00:33:07,899
is I'd look at it I'm like yeah that

859
00:33:05,020 --> 00:33:10,900
looks good copy-paste compiles perfect

860
00:33:07,900 --> 00:33:13,900
continue coding if you can just convince

861
00:33:10,900 --> 00:33:15,520
developers instead to so whatever is the

862
00:33:13,900 --> 00:33:17,380
top thing on stack overflow you better

863
00:33:15,520 --> 00:33:19,840
believe it is the least secure way to do

864
00:33:17,380 --> 00:33:23,680
anything because when you remove all of

865
00:33:19,840 --> 00:33:25,570
the security everything works better so

866
00:33:23,680 --> 00:33:26,920
if you can convince them instead to go

867
00:33:25,570 --> 00:33:29,290
so there's this new pair of Stack

868
00:33:26,920 --> 00:33:30,700
Exchange called the security part you

869
00:33:29,290 --> 00:33:32,710
can ask them to look there instead or

870
00:33:30,700 --> 00:33:34,330
ask them to look up the most secure way

871
00:33:32,710 --> 00:33:35,740
to do something so instead of taking 30

872
00:33:34,330 --> 00:33:38,830
seconds I want you to take two minutes

873
00:33:35,740 --> 00:33:40,900
and do it the secure way instead right

874
00:33:38,830 --> 00:33:42,850
just look up how to do that instead this

875
00:33:40,900 --> 00:33:43,730
will make a huge huge difference in your

876
00:33:42,850 --> 00:33:46,490
code base

877
00:33:43,730 --> 00:33:48,110
and another thing that you can try to

878
00:33:46,490 --> 00:33:51,380
encourage developers to do is become

879
00:33:48,110 --> 00:33:53,059
security champions so I have people that

880
00:33:51,380 --> 00:33:54,559
will come to me they're really excited

881
00:33:53,059 --> 00:33:56,750
about security and they want to learn

882
00:33:54,559 --> 00:33:59,210
more and then I teach them stuff and

883
00:33:56,750 --> 00:34:01,580
then they go show other people and it

884
00:33:59,210 --> 00:34:07,940
propagates and it's like investing and

885
00:34:01,580 --> 00:34:09,259
then your money grows but better when

886
00:34:07,940 --> 00:34:11,899
you have someone come to you and they're

887
00:34:09,260 --> 00:34:13,700
interested spend time with them it's an

888
00:34:11,899 --> 00:34:15,918
investment and it will grow it will be

889
00:34:13,699 --> 00:34:17,899
worth it especially if they're chatty

890
00:34:15,918 --> 00:34:19,399
and they want to talk to people and

891
00:34:17,899 --> 00:34:21,199
they're excited they will tell other

892
00:34:19,399 --> 00:34:23,210
people and all of this will grow and

893
00:34:21,199 --> 00:34:25,129
propagate for you you as a security

894
00:34:23,210 --> 00:34:28,040
person so from what I understand the

895
00:34:25,129 --> 00:34:30,799
general ratio is 100 developers to 10

896
00:34:28,040 --> 00:34:32,960
Ops people to 1 security person right

897
00:34:30,800 --> 00:34:34,550
that's not really great odds you don't

898
00:34:32,960 --> 00:34:36,770
have time to train every single person

899
00:34:34,550 --> 00:34:38,869
but if you can spend time with 3 or 4

900
00:34:36,770 --> 00:34:41,480
different developers and have them go

901
00:34:38,869 --> 00:34:43,579
and spread that to 12 other people each

902
00:34:41,480 --> 00:34:45,020
like it just it propagates and it's

903
00:34:43,579 --> 00:34:49,369
really great and if you can encourage it

904
00:34:45,020 --> 00:34:54,109
it's awesome I'm gonna talk about wasp

905
00:34:49,369 --> 00:34:55,609
again it's happening I'm sorry this is a

906
00:34:54,109 --> 00:34:59,420
free resource that all of you can use

907
00:34:55,609 --> 00:35:01,040
right we volunteer for them or a

908
00:34:59,420 --> 00:35:02,480
nonprofit organization that's

909
00:35:01,040 --> 00:35:03,680
international there's a chapter here

910
00:35:02,480 --> 00:35:05,270
there's chapters all over the world

911
00:35:03,680 --> 00:35:06,770
whatever country you're from if there's

912
00:35:05,270 --> 00:35:08,750
any English speakers you probably have a

913
00:35:06,770 --> 00:35:10,790
chapter hiding out somewhere it might be

914
00:35:08,750 --> 00:35:16,700
sleepy you may need to wake it up and

915
00:35:10,790 --> 00:35:19,520
tell it you need it but you can use some

916
00:35:16,700 --> 00:35:20,810
of their products which are all free you

917
00:35:19,520 --> 00:35:22,130
can use their tools you can read their

918
00:35:20,810 --> 00:35:24,410
books they actually have books that you

919
00:35:22,130 --> 00:35:25,790
can order they're free you can download

920
00:35:24,410 --> 00:35:27,470
the PDF or you can pay to have it

921
00:35:25,790 --> 00:35:30,050
printed you can have a physical copy if

922
00:35:27,470 --> 00:35:32,328
you can get your developers into this if

923
00:35:30,050 --> 00:35:34,780
you the security team can get into this

924
00:35:32,329 --> 00:35:37,320
oh it's going to be so good and

925
00:35:34,780 --> 00:35:40,540
have a new project about cloud security

926
00:35:37,320 --> 00:35:41,860
yes and they're getting more and more

927
00:35:40,540 --> 00:35:43,810
things like a bunch of their tools can

928
00:35:41,860 --> 00:35:47,050
be integrated into your DevOps pipeline

929
00:35:43,810 --> 00:35:48,460
it's such a good deal I'm looking at the

930
00:35:47,050 --> 00:35:51,430
time guy he hasn't even showed me

931
00:35:48,460 --> 00:35:53,440
anything yet yes anyway if you can get

932
00:35:51,430 --> 00:35:55,540
your developers to join a wasp in the 10

933
00:35:53,440 --> 00:35:57,910
meetings and learn stuff if you do it

934
00:35:55,540 --> 00:35:59,800
you will stand out from your peers ray

935
00:35:57,910 --> 00:36:01,390
if you're in application security like

936
00:35:59,800 --> 00:36:03,550
you you really have to be a part of this

937
00:36:01,390 --> 00:36:06,940
but if you can convince your developers

938
00:36:03,550 --> 00:36:08,800
and other areas of IT to come to 200 ask

939
00:36:06,940 --> 00:36:10,990
they will learn a whole ton of amazing

940
00:36:08,800 --> 00:36:13,630
things and your security it'll just go

941
00:36:10,990 --> 00:36:16,600
up like this like all all the stuff is

942
00:36:13,630 --> 00:36:20,320
free it's such a great deal anyway next

943
00:36:16,600 --> 00:36:22,980
with that I'm going to ask if anyone has

944
00:36:20,320 --> 00:36:28,079
any questions

945
00:36:22,980 --> 00:36:30,570
oh and we have candy for you I know the

946
00:36:28,079 --> 00:36:31,800
audiences are shy sometimes but I was

947
00:36:30,570 --> 00:36:32,790
really nice to the people ask questions

948
00:36:31,800 --> 00:36:40,550
in the morning

949
00:36:32,790 --> 00:36:44,150
you sir mm-hmm you have a chapter I

950
00:36:40,550 --> 00:36:44,150
think you have to Oh

951
00:36:50,830 --> 00:36:57,470
it's changed the culture yes no how can

952
00:36:54,920 --> 00:37:00,170
we talk into the management that we

953
00:36:57,470 --> 00:37:02,680
should lift shift to the left not to

954
00:37:00,170 --> 00:37:06,170
change the culture is also cost more

955
00:37:02,680 --> 00:37:08,680
budget than before so how can we like

956
00:37:06,170 --> 00:37:11,510
talking to the banishment to ship left

957
00:37:08,680 --> 00:37:16,700
so the first time that I managed to

958
00:37:11,510 --> 00:37:18,980
convince management to do this I'm not

959
00:37:16,700 --> 00:37:21,770
gonna say where I worked but we had a

960
00:37:18,980 --> 00:37:23,750
bunch of security incidents over an

961
00:37:21,770 --> 00:37:26,240
event we were doing and I made her a

962
00:37:23,750 --> 00:37:28,160
port I'm really really anal retentive

963
00:37:26,240 --> 00:37:29,299
I'm really obsessive about things so I

964
00:37:28,160 --> 00:37:30,649
made a report about all the different

965
00:37:29,300 --> 00:37:32,720
incidents we had and I grouped them into

966
00:37:30,650 --> 00:37:35,030
sections like here's this huge section

967
00:37:32,720 --> 00:37:36,709
of application security related problems

968
00:37:35,030 --> 00:37:39,020
that we had all of these were easily

969
00:37:36,710 --> 00:37:40,760
preventable like all of these are such

970
00:37:39,020 --> 00:37:43,040
low-hanging fruit like I can I can

971
00:37:40,760 --> 00:37:44,990
definitely solve all of this in like the

972
00:37:43,040 --> 00:37:47,570
next nine months before our next event

973
00:37:44,990 --> 00:37:49,189
like just just let me just let me and

974
00:37:47,570 --> 00:37:51,260
because I showed the metrics and I

975
00:37:49,190 --> 00:37:53,180
explained the risk and I showed them the

976
00:37:51,260 --> 00:37:55,610
bad things that happened they're like

977
00:37:53,180 --> 00:37:56,839
you know what Tonya you know there you

978
00:37:55,610 --> 00:37:59,330
have like five months left on your

979
00:37:56,840 --> 00:38:01,310
contract just give her just do it and I

980
00:37:59,330 --> 00:38:03,110
got all the developer scanning the SAP I

981
00:38:01,310 --> 00:38:05,000
gave them lessons I did all these things

982
00:38:03,110 --> 00:38:08,050
are so exciting and we saw all of the

983
00:38:05,000 --> 00:38:10,490
codebase just go like this is so magical

984
00:38:08,050 --> 00:38:13,280
stats are is a really good way like

985
00:38:10,490 --> 00:38:15,470
metrics

986
00:38:13,280 --> 00:38:17,450
okay I know this sounds bad but create a

987
00:38:15,470 --> 00:38:19,759
pretty report with pictures and graphs

988
00:38:17,450 --> 00:38:23,000
executives like this don't make like

989
00:38:19,760 --> 00:38:25,190
don't make bull make real real numbers

990
00:38:23,000 --> 00:38:27,800
right and there's this thing from wasp

991
00:38:25,190 --> 00:38:29,510
which is free called defect dojo and it

992
00:38:27,800 --> 00:38:30,950
will suck up all the results from all

993
00:38:29,510 --> 00:38:33,140
your security tools and then make these

994
00:38:30,950 --> 00:38:35,720
beautiful metrics and make reports and

995
00:38:33,140 --> 00:38:39,680
you can make management style reports

996
00:38:35,720 --> 00:38:42,319
that are just great also I work

997
00:38:39,680 --> 00:38:44,660
somewhere once and they wouldn't fix any

998
00:38:42,320 --> 00:38:46,430
of we had a we had some external pen

999
00:38:44,660 --> 00:38:48,649
testers come in and they just shredded

1000
00:38:46,430 --> 00:38:50,419
everything and I could not get the

1001
00:38:48,650 --> 00:38:52,220
developers to agree to change any of the

1002
00:38:50,420 --> 00:38:53,750
things and I was new to security and I

1003
00:38:52,220 --> 00:38:55,580
was like but I was hoping he would fix

1004
00:38:53,750 --> 00:38:57,110
this and it just wasn't working

1005
00:38:55,580 --> 00:38:59,360
no one's giving me any to any attention

1006
00:38:57,110 --> 00:39:01,790
so so this is a stunt so you should not

1007
00:38:59,360 --> 00:39:04,900
do this every time but I wrote up a

1008
00:39:01,790 --> 00:39:07,580
report that explained the risks of

1009
00:39:04,900 --> 00:39:10,250
exactly what could happen for each one

1010
00:39:07,580 --> 00:39:12,500
of the things and then I sent it to the

1011
00:39:10,250 --> 00:39:14,120
chief information officer and the

1012
00:39:12,500 --> 00:39:15,350
departmental security officer so the

1013
00:39:14,120 --> 00:39:17,750
person that's in charge of all the

1014
00:39:15,350 --> 00:39:19,759
physical security and IT security and

1015
00:39:17,750 --> 00:39:21,440
then the person in charge of all of IT

1016
00:39:19,760 --> 00:39:23,540
and I was like oh could you sign off on

1017
00:39:21,440 --> 00:39:25,430
the risk for this because I need you to

1018
00:39:23,540 --> 00:39:27,200
accept all of this this risk that it's

1019
00:39:25,430 --> 00:39:28,910
okay with you that these things are

1020
00:39:27,200 --> 00:39:30,410
happening with our brand new biggest

1021
00:39:28,910 --> 00:39:32,540
piece of software we've ever built and

1022
00:39:30,410 --> 00:39:34,730
then departmental security officer calls

1023
00:39:32,540 --> 00:39:36,950
music tanya was described I'm not saying

1024
00:39:34,730 --> 00:39:38,910
this this is horrible we can't put this

1025
00:39:36,950 --> 00:39:40,890
out there Zak well bill

1026
00:39:38,910 --> 00:39:42,569
you know maybe I could I could tell them

1027
00:39:40,890 --> 00:39:45,058
that you don't tell them bill sent you a

1028
00:39:42,569 --> 00:39:46,500
mic okay and I'm like um well bill said

1029
00:39:45,059 --> 00:39:48,960
and then everyone just like what bill

1030
00:39:46,500 --> 00:39:51,329
said and and then everyone fixed

1031
00:39:48,960 --> 00:39:55,440
basically everything it was awesome

1032
00:39:51,329 --> 00:39:57,839
so I basically one of my directors told

1033
00:39:55,440 --> 00:39:59,339
me one day if because I was all upset I

1034
00:39:57,839 --> 00:40:01,349
was like we need to do this and they

1035
00:39:59,339 --> 00:40:03,839
voted no and I'm like I don't understand

1036
00:40:01,349 --> 00:40:04,770
I was like I wouldn't say howdy I would

1037
00:40:03,839 --> 00:40:06,900
go that far

1038
00:40:04,770 --> 00:40:08,130
and he's like Tonya you didn't explain

1039
00:40:06,900 --> 00:40:10,380
the risk properly if you're this upset

1040
00:40:08,130 --> 00:40:12,720
about it you certainly didn't make us

1041
00:40:10,380 --> 00:40:15,660
that upset about it it's like what's the

1042
00:40:12,720 --> 00:40:17,339
problem and so then I explained to him

1043
00:40:15,660 --> 00:40:19,500
and he's like you need to go again next

1044
00:40:17,339 --> 00:40:20,880
week and you need to explain the real

1045
00:40:19,500 --> 00:40:22,349
reasons the real things that can happen

1046
00:40:20,880 --> 00:40:23,670
and why you're really worried and why

1047
00:40:22,349 --> 00:40:25,200
you're like we can we can set this

1048
00:40:23,670 --> 00:40:26,910
security project aside and we really

1049
00:40:25,200 --> 00:40:29,490
need to do this one so it's a lot about

1050
00:40:26,910 --> 00:40:31,920
communication because if they don't

1051
00:40:29,490 --> 00:40:33,808
understand what the risks are or if

1052
00:40:31,920 --> 00:40:35,609
every single thing for you is an

1053
00:40:33,809 --> 00:40:37,230
emergency you know what I mean like

1054
00:40:35,609 --> 00:40:39,058
after a while they stop listening to you

1055
00:40:37,230 --> 00:40:40,890
so if you can clearly explain and

1056
00:40:39,059 --> 00:40:44,160
communicate which is hard it's hard for

1057
00:40:40,890 --> 00:40:46,670
techie people to communicate I know

1058
00:40:44,160 --> 00:40:51,990
thank you for your question

1059
00:40:46,670 --> 00:40:53,250
the left course of a software

1060
00:40:51,990 --> 00:40:56,879
development life cycle is the

1061
00:40:53,250 --> 00:41:00,080
requirement in your experience what how

1062
00:40:56,880 --> 00:41:03,720
how do you deal with requirement that

1063
00:41:00,080 --> 00:41:06,330
when you look at it that and and know

1064
00:41:03,720 --> 00:41:11,069
that or they don't think about security

1065
00:41:06,330 --> 00:41:15,150
at all so I used to work for the

1066
00:41:11,070 --> 00:41:17,340
Canadian government till Friday and we

1067
00:41:15,150 --> 00:41:20,760
have this thing called itst 33 which is

1068
00:41:17,340 --> 00:41:22,920
painful and what I did is like I wrote a

1069
00:41:20,760 --> 00:41:26,340
thing kind of next to it so all the

1070
00:41:22,920 --> 00:41:30,240
things that apply to software and then I

1071
00:41:26,340 --> 00:41:31,920
just reworded it in security manure

1072
00:41:30,240 --> 00:41:33,509
words instead of security words and then

1073
00:41:31,920 --> 00:41:35,130
basically like oh you're doing an app

1074
00:41:33,510 --> 00:41:36,780
you know are you doing file upload boom

1075
00:41:35,130 --> 00:41:37,890
I need you to do those things we're

1076
00:41:36,780 --> 00:41:39,330
gonna add that to your project cause

1077
00:41:37,890 --> 00:41:41,520
you're doing file upload oh you're gonna

1078
00:41:39,330 --> 00:41:43,759
do this boom I'm gonna add that now to

1079
00:41:41,520 --> 00:41:46,259
your list of things I need you to do and

1080
00:41:43,760 --> 00:41:48,060
so then I could just reference that so

1081
00:41:46,260 --> 00:41:49,170
when I looked at their requirements you

1082
00:41:48,060 --> 00:41:51,360
know there's some that are always there

1083
00:41:49,170 --> 00:41:54,180
so like the Canadian government has this

1084
00:41:51,360 --> 00:41:57,240
HTTP only thing so all of the websites

1085
00:41:54,180 --> 00:41:58,830
are we're gonna do that right and so

1086
00:41:57,240 --> 00:41:59,970
that automatically is in there so

1087
00:41:58,830 --> 00:42:01,529
they're something like automatically in

1088
00:41:59,970 --> 00:42:02,970
there every time and then and that's

1089
00:42:01,530 --> 00:42:05,040
just like oh are you doing this okay you

1090
00:42:02,970 --> 00:42:07,709
need this it's like a shopping cart and

1091
00:42:05,040 --> 00:42:09,630
I had like thirty three things and you

1092
00:42:07,710 --> 00:42:12,800
have some of you have like six for sure

1093
00:42:09,630 --> 00:42:14,120
and then you might have more and then

1094
00:42:12,800 --> 00:42:16,340
I'm just like could you could you do

1095
00:42:14,120 --> 00:42:18,109
these things thank you I'm so that's

1096
00:42:16,340 --> 00:42:20,210
that's how it worked that what works

1097
00:42:18,110 --> 00:42:22,880
best for me personally like coming up

1098
00:42:20,210 --> 00:42:25,160
with this list you might need to have

1099
00:42:22,880 --> 00:42:28,450
language specific things so for instance

1100
00:42:25,160 --> 00:42:30,649
if you're doing Java D serialization ah

1101
00:42:28,450 --> 00:42:33,129
right so if you're using Java

1102
00:42:30,650 --> 00:42:35,630
I also need these things from you right

1103
00:42:33,130 --> 00:42:37,610
if you're using a framework I need you

1104
00:42:35,630 --> 00:42:39,320
to use the newest framework like things

1105
00:42:37,610 --> 00:42:41,270
like that so if you can come up with a

1106
00:42:39,320 --> 00:42:43,490
list of things and then you just do your

1107
00:42:41,270 --> 00:42:45,259
check boxes and you just you tell them

1108
00:42:43,490 --> 00:42:48,049
those few things that you need oh my

1109
00:42:45,260 --> 00:42:49,820
times up thank you very much for your

1110
00:42:48,050 --> 00:42:51,050
question thank you for having me if you

1111
00:42:49,820 --> 00:42:52,670
have more questions just come see me

1112
00:42:51,050 --> 00:42:54,880
