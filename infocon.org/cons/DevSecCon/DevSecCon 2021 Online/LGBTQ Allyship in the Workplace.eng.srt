1
00:00:03,280 --> 00:00:04,000
well welcome

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:07,839
everyone to a session that is a recap

3
00:00:07,839 --> 00:00:10,320
of a session that we did at devsecond24

4
00:00:10,320 --> 00:00:11,920
in 2021

5
00:00:11,920 --> 00:00:15,360
a couple of weeks back and we're excited

6
00:00:15,360 --> 00:00:17,480
to re-record this discussion about

7
00:00:17,480 --> 00:00:20,160
lgbtqia plus and tech

8
00:00:20,160 --> 00:00:22,880
and and have some concerns that we can't

9
00:00:22,880 --> 00:00:24,560
recreate it perfectly but but do hope

10
00:00:24,560 --> 00:00:25,680
that you'll come along with us on the

11
00:00:25,680 --> 00:00:26,560
journey so

12
00:00:26,560 --> 00:00:28,000
with this sir heidi and nathan i'm going

13
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:29,519
to let them introduce themselves here in

14
00:00:29,519 --> 00:00:30,240
a moment

15
00:00:30,240 --> 00:00:32,159
but today's discussion is really going

16
00:00:32,159 --> 00:00:33,760
to be around fostering

17
00:00:33,760 --> 00:00:36,079
the sense of inclusion uh while

18
00:00:36,079 --> 00:00:37,920
recognizing also that last month many of

19
00:00:37,920 --> 00:00:39,600
us around the world celebrated pride

20
00:00:39,600 --> 00:00:40,320
month

21
00:00:40,320 --> 00:00:44,239
uh and the the amazing lgbtq community

22
00:00:44,239 --> 00:00:46,320
the goal in this next 20 or so minutes

23
00:00:46,320 --> 00:00:47,520
is going to be to educate

24
00:00:47,520 --> 00:00:49,920
a little bit further to celebrate to

25
00:00:49,920 --> 00:00:51,440
drive responsible growth for our

26
00:00:51,440 --> 00:00:52,320
companies

27
00:00:52,320 --> 00:00:54,320
through this notion of inclusion

28
00:00:54,320 --> 00:00:56,000
celebration allyship

29
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:58,960
etc and encourage becoming comfortable

30
00:00:58,960 --> 00:01:00,079
there's a lot of folks who are very

31
00:01:00,079 --> 00:01:00,960
uncomfortable

32
00:01:00,960 --> 00:01:03,680
as their organizations become diverse uh

33
00:01:03,680 --> 00:01:05,360
and and i think that that it's sometimes

34
00:01:05,360 --> 00:01:06,720
okay to call out that elephant in the

35
00:01:06,720 --> 00:01:08,479
room and and get right to it

36
00:01:08,479 --> 00:01:10,000
you know we don't all come from exactly

37
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:11,360
the same backgrounds but that doesn't

38
00:01:11,360 --> 00:01:12,320
mean that we can't

39
00:01:12,320 --> 00:01:14,400
get along beautifully and and and create

40
00:01:14,400 --> 00:01:15,520
really great companies and great

41
00:01:15,520 --> 00:01:17,119
cultures together so the audience for

42
00:01:17,119 --> 00:01:17,920
this

43
00:01:17,920 --> 00:01:19,680
was again the audience that came uh of

44
00:01:19,680 --> 00:01:22,000
the thousands of developers that came to

45
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:23,600
the dev set con conference sponsored by

46
00:01:23,600 --> 00:01:25,520
sneak here a while back and we really do

47
00:01:25,520 --> 00:01:26,799
hope that this helps all of our

48
00:01:26,799 --> 00:01:28,000
colleagues out in the industry better

49
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:29,040
understand

50
00:01:29,040 --> 00:01:31,360
that hey some of our colleagues uh

51
00:01:31,360 --> 00:01:32,240
really

52
00:01:32,240 --> 00:01:34,400
need to be heard and and if we allow all

53
00:01:34,400 --> 00:01:35,840
perspectives at the table again we're

54
00:01:35,840 --> 00:01:37,759
gonna all build better companies so

55
00:01:37,759 --> 00:01:39,520
if heidi and nathan you could just

56
00:01:39,520 --> 00:01:40,720
introduce yourselves briefly then i'll

57
00:01:40,720 --> 00:01:41,840
just i'll pepper you with some good

58
00:01:41,840 --> 00:01:44,000
questions and we'll go from there

59
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:45,920
absolutely so let me start by saying

60
00:01:45,920 --> 00:01:47,600
quickly sorry heidi i'm brian

61
00:01:47,600 --> 00:01:50,079
i lead impact uh which means social and

62
00:01:50,079 --> 00:01:51,759
environmental governance impact

63
00:01:51,759 --> 00:01:55,040
uh here at sneak um and i'm just

64
00:01:55,040 --> 00:01:57,040
ecstatic that a focus area for us

65
00:01:57,040 --> 00:01:58,479
broadly across the industry is going to

66
00:01:58,479 --> 00:01:58,880
be

67
00:01:58,880 --> 00:02:01,439
create more inclusion equity belonging

68
00:02:01,439 --> 00:02:02,159
um

69
00:02:02,159 --> 00:02:04,640
uh in our in our in our industry

70
00:02:04,640 --> 00:02:06,240
generally as software is built and

71
00:02:06,240 --> 00:02:07,759
software is made more secure i think we

72
00:02:07,759 --> 00:02:09,119
can do that in a more inclusive way as

73
00:02:09,119 --> 00:02:10,160
well as we go

74
00:02:10,160 --> 00:02:13,200

78
00:02:18,480 --> 00:02:20,239

um that join us here obviously dni is

88
00:02:38,319 --> 00:02:40,040
something that my core

89
00:02:40,040 --> 00:02:42,640
lgbtq plus is something that is close to

90
00:02:42,640 --> 00:02:43,599
my heart

91
00:02:43,599 --> 00:02:45,280
and something that i think needs more

92
00:02:45,280 --> 00:02:47,200
awareness and i myself i know that we

93
00:02:47,200 --> 00:02:48,560

00:03:16,959 --> 00:03:18,480
everything right

107
00:03:18,480 --> 00:03:20,640
yeah a lot of starts and times remember

108
00:03:20,640 --> 00:03:22,480
every time i covered everything so i

109
00:03:22,480 --> 00:03:25,280
always forget things but yes that's me

110
00:03:25,280 --> 00:03:27,680
wonderful wonderful well i think that

111
00:03:27,680 --> 00:03:28,560
with with

112
00:03:28,560 --> 00:03:30,640
the way this discussion can flow it it

113
00:03:30,640 --> 00:03:33,040
would be i think really great for us to

114
00:03:33,040 --> 00:03:34,879
start with a pretty broad topic this

115
00:03:34,879 --> 00:03:35,599
topic that

116
00:03:35,599 --> 00:03:37,360
some people got exposed to in the past

117
00:03:37,360 --> 00:03:39,040
few months or a year

118
00:03:39,040 --> 00:03:40,239
around the world that didn't know about

119
00:03:40,239 --> 00:03:42,239
it first but it's allyship

120
00:03:42,239 --> 00:03:45,200
uh and this notion of being an ally in

121
00:03:45,200 --> 00:03:47,440
your life or in your in your work life

122
00:03:47,440 --> 00:03:50,239
at work uh and then what ally ship means

123
00:03:50,239 --> 00:03:50,959
not just

124
00:03:50,959 --> 00:03:52,879
in the professional context but here at

125
00:03:52,879 --> 00:03:54,799
sneak so hey maybe i'll start with you

126
00:03:54,799 --> 00:03:56,319
what's what's an ally for you

127
00:03:56,319 --> 00:03:58,799
and in work and here at sneak where we

128
00:03:58,799 --> 00:03:59,840
work

129
00:03:59,840 --> 00:04:02,959
absolutely so for me um allyship is

130
00:04:02,959 --> 00:04:04,319
something that is

131
00:04:04,319 --> 00:04:06,640
um an extremely strong calling for me

132
00:04:06,640 --> 00:04:08,560
but can mean lots of different things

133
00:04:08,560 --> 00:04:10,080
for other people but

134
00:04:10,080 --> 00:04:12,159
it's someone who's going to support um

135
00:04:12,159 --> 00:04:14,560
equality right whether that's gender

136
00:04:14,560 --> 00:04:17,600
lgbt social movements um it's

137
00:04:17,600 --> 00:04:20,880
challenging things like homophobia um

138
00:04:20,880 --> 00:04:23,120
transphobia anything where we're seeing

139
00:04:23,120 --> 00:04:25,600
where someone is not being treated

140
00:04:25,600 --> 00:04:29,040
um as equal as or has given a a forum to

141
00:04:29,040 --> 00:04:30,400
be themselves

142
00:04:30,400 --> 00:04:33,360
and i think being an ally is identifying

143
00:04:33,360 --> 00:04:34,800
that we have the power to

144
00:04:34,800 --> 00:04:38,080
help people within that community so um

145
00:04:38,080 --> 00:04:39,759
here at sneak i know that obviously

146
00:04:39,759 --> 00:04:41,759
social impact program was something i

147
00:04:41,759 --> 00:04:43,280
mentioned when we did this the first

148
00:04:43,280 --> 00:04:44,639
time around and it's something that

149
00:04:44,639 --> 00:04:46,160
obviously brian you're very heavily

150
00:04:46,160 --> 00:04:47,199
involved in

151
00:04:47,199 --> 00:04:49,440
um but our social impact program here at

152
00:04:49,440 --> 00:04:52,160
sneak um is a community where we promote

153
00:04:52,160 --> 00:04:54,080
that inclusive environment

154
00:04:54,080 --> 00:04:56,320
and provide equal opportunities so we

155
00:04:56,320 --> 00:04:57,919
have things like sneak for good where we

156
00:04:57,919 --> 00:04:59,360
focus on charities close to our

157
00:04:59,360 --> 00:05:00,320
community

158
00:05:00,320 --> 00:05:02,479
um last month these were very heavily i

159
00:05:02,479 --> 00:05:04,160
think i mentioned about annie's place

160
00:05:04,160 --> 00:05:04,720
which is

161
00:05:04,720 --> 00:05:07,120
a safe haven for people to go to from

162
00:05:07,120 --> 00:05:08,880
the lgbt community

163
00:05:08,880 --> 00:05:12,080
um we have things to do with um all

164
00:05:12,080 --> 00:05:14,240
types of actual challenges that people

165
00:05:14,240 --> 00:05:14,720
face

166
00:05:14,720 --> 00:05:17,120
um in different types of community but

167
00:05:17,120 --> 00:05:19,440
we've got anti-lgbtq plus violence

168
00:05:19,440 --> 00:05:20,479
projects

169
00:05:20,479 --> 00:05:23,360
um and we work on things like this and

170
00:05:23,360 --> 00:05:24,000
although we

171
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:26,800
celebrate pride and we do recognize that

172
00:05:26,800 --> 00:05:28,560
importance we actually maintain these

173
00:05:28,560 --> 00:05:29,840
activities

174
00:05:29,840 --> 00:05:32,240
every day of the year um and we have

175
00:05:32,240 --> 00:05:33,759
tailored policies so my

176
00:05:33,759 --> 00:05:36,560
i myself on the recruitment team um you

177
00:05:36,560 --> 00:05:38,320
know we make sure that we use inclusive

178
00:05:38,320 --> 00:05:39,199
language

179
00:05:39,199 --> 00:05:42,080
on all of our external pages to do with

180
00:05:42,080 --> 00:05:44,160
how we're hiring we make sure that our

181
00:05:44,160 --> 00:05:45,280
hiring managers

182
00:05:45,280 --> 00:05:48,560
are agreeing to um a different

183
00:05:48,560 --> 00:05:51,039
type of working to maybe what they're

184
00:05:51,039 --> 00:05:52,800
used to where we try and make sure that

185
00:05:52,800 --> 00:05:54,720
everyone has that equal opportunity we

186
00:05:54,720 --> 00:05:56,479
remove that bias

187
00:05:56,479 --> 00:05:58,960
um internal we have our sneak resource

188
00:05:58,960 --> 00:06:00,759
group so that can be

189
00:06:00,759 --> 00:06:03,919
lgbtq community we have slack channels

190
00:06:03,919 --> 00:06:06,319
we have um you know people of different

191
00:06:06,319 --> 00:06:08,560
race maybe who might want a forum to

192
00:06:08,560 --> 00:06:10,000
have that safe space

193
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:12,240
so there's there's so many ways in which

194
00:06:12,240 --> 00:06:13,120
sneak is an

195
00:06:13,120 --> 00:06:16,240
ally as a company um and it gives the

196
00:06:16,240 --> 00:06:18,160
opportunity for people to be

197
00:06:18,160 --> 00:06:20,400
placed at the forefront of our minds as

198
00:06:20,400 --> 00:06:22,560
employees but also gives a forum for

199
00:06:22,560 --> 00:06:23,600
people to

200
00:06:23,600 --> 00:06:26,160
enter in as much allyship as they feel

201
00:06:26,160 --> 00:06:27,919
comfortable to so although i would

202
00:06:27,919 --> 00:06:29,919
consider myself a strong ally

203
00:06:29,919 --> 00:06:31,840
for some people who maybe not it might

204
00:06:31,840 --> 00:06:33,440
not come naturally to

205
00:06:33,440 --> 00:06:35,199
we give that empowerment to say

206
00:06:35,199 --> 00:06:37,280
whichever level of allyship you feel

207
00:06:37,280 --> 00:06:38,639
comfortable with

208
00:06:38,639 --> 00:06:42,080
we would welcome love it love it and so

209
00:06:42,080 --> 00:06:44,479
allyship as you see it then is is this

210
00:06:44,479 --> 00:06:45,919
notion of the concept

211
00:06:45,919 --> 00:06:48,400
of creating equity in your approaches in

212
00:06:48,400 --> 00:06:49,120
your

213
00:06:49,120 --> 00:06:52,560
in your in your uh just general

214
00:06:52,560 --> 00:06:54,319
operating approach but that also

215
00:06:54,319 --> 00:06:56,319
companies can be proactive at fostering

216
00:06:56,319 --> 00:06:56,960
allyship

217
00:06:56,960 --> 00:06:59,039
and and teaming that up in a more

218
00:06:59,039 --> 00:07:00,319
structural way

219
00:07:00,319 --> 00:07:02,000
even or through activities through

220
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:03,919
learning opportunities and so on

221
00:07:03,919 --> 00:07:05,680
nathan over to you any any thoughts on

222
00:07:05,680 --> 00:07:07,199
that

223
00:07:07,199 --> 00:07:08,319
i was going to say there were two things

224
00:07:08,319 --> 00:07:10,400
that i was saying that sort of really

225
00:07:10,400 --> 00:07:12,080
like resonated with me and i think there

226
00:07:12,080 --> 00:07:15,280
was the one that this concept that um

227
00:07:15,280 --> 00:07:16,880
being an ally just isn't just during

228
00:07:16,880 --> 00:07:19,039
pride right like it's all year round and

229
00:07:19,039 --> 00:07:20,240
it's like creating that sort of

230
00:07:20,240 --> 00:07:21,680
environment or that

231
00:07:21,680 --> 00:07:24,160
uh i guess platform where your people

232
00:07:24,160 --> 00:07:25,520
feel like they're comfortable to sort of

233
00:07:25,520 --> 00:07:27,280
embrace it at their own pace or step in

234
00:07:27,280 --> 00:07:28,720
as much as they want to

235
00:07:28,720 --> 00:07:30,880
like you know for for me as a gay man

236
00:07:30,880 --> 00:07:32,800
and this organization it's great that i

237
00:07:32,800 --> 00:07:34,880
do feel like i can be myself and sort of

238
00:07:34,880 --> 00:07:37,120
i don't have to

239
00:07:37,120 --> 00:07:38,800
be forced into the spotlight at a

240
00:07:38,800 --> 00:07:40,639
certain event just to be a token sort of

241
00:07:40,639 --> 00:07:41,680
i guess gay uh

242
00:07:41,680 --> 00:07:42,800
champion or something like that it's

243
00:07:42,800 --> 00:07:44,400
more like i could talk so i want to and

244
00:07:44,400 --> 00:07:45,919
sneak helps provide that platform so i

245
00:07:45,919 --> 00:07:47,440
think that's really ultimately it right

246
00:07:47,440 --> 00:07:48,639
giving

247
00:07:48,639 --> 00:07:50,319
people that platform that space to be

248
00:07:50,319 --> 00:07:52,479
comfortable themselves and then also

249
00:07:52,479 --> 00:07:54,160
being consistent too it's not just a

250
00:07:54,160 --> 00:07:56,000
rainbow logo to put on for one month of

251
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:56,879
the year

252
00:07:56,879 --> 00:07:59,680
that's all the time so the allyship if

253
00:07:59,680 --> 00:08:00,000
it's

254
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:02,240
authentic if it's pure then it it kind

255
00:08:02,240 --> 00:08:03,840
of lives in the organization

256
00:08:03,840 --> 00:08:05,440
throughout the way the organization

257
00:08:05,440 --> 00:08:07,199
conducts itself and it's not a

258
00:08:07,199 --> 00:08:08,720
it's not a marketing campaign or it's

259
00:08:08,720 --> 00:08:10,560
not a it's not a surface level thing

260
00:08:10,560 --> 00:08:11,039
it's a

261
00:08:11,039 --> 00:08:14,319
it's a receptivity it's a supportiveness

262
00:08:14,319 --> 00:08:16,319
uh and it's in its in it's an it's an

263
00:08:16,319 --> 00:08:18,080
authentic way of operating all around

264
00:08:18,080 --> 00:08:18,400
the

265
00:08:18,400 --> 00:08:21,120
the year well that that that i think

266
00:08:21,120 --> 00:08:22,720
might tie that into and i don't know for

267
00:08:22,720 --> 00:08:24,240
sure where these where these two topics

268
00:08:24,240 --> 00:08:26,319
differ but nate i get i go over to you

269
00:08:26,319 --> 00:08:29,280
what might it mean for all of the

270
00:08:29,280 --> 00:08:30,560
employees at sneak or

271
00:08:30,560 --> 00:08:32,000
in another organization to be able to

272
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:33,839
bring their whole self into that

273
00:08:33,839 --> 00:08:34,719
environment

274
00:08:34,719 --> 00:08:36,640
we read a lot about psychological safety

275
00:08:36,640 --> 00:08:38,320
as being a real factor for people being

276
00:08:38,320 --> 00:08:40,080
successful in their careers

277
00:08:40,080 --> 00:08:42,479
i think that probably ties into it but

278
00:08:42,479 --> 00:08:43,599
is there

279
00:08:43,599 --> 00:08:45,920
is there is there this notion of

280
00:08:45,920 --> 00:08:47,360
bringing your whole self to work that

281
00:08:47,360 --> 00:08:48,880
that that when it's at the forefront

282
00:08:48,880 --> 00:08:50,480
really does benefit organizations do you

283
00:08:50,480 --> 00:08:52,000
have any any thoughts around that whole

284
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:53,440
self to work concept

285
00:08:53,440 --> 00:08:56,000
so many on this one i mean like from

286
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:57,839
someone who spent so much of his time of

287
00:08:57,839 --> 00:08:59,279
his life in the closet pretending i

288
00:08:59,279 --> 00:08:59,920
wasn't gay

289
00:08:59,920 --> 00:09:03,200
you know i can tell you how uh painfully

290
00:09:03,200 --> 00:09:04,959
jarring is to be living a lie and then

291
00:09:04,959 --> 00:09:06,399
to be able to sort of like shrug that

292
00:09:06,399 --> 00:09:07,600
off and actually come

293
00:09:07,600 --> 00:09:09,040
to terms of who you are and be

294
00:09:09,040 --> 00:09:10,560
comfortable in yourself your authentic

295
00:09:10,560 --> 00:09:12,240
self whatever that is that's so

296
00:09:12,240 --> 00:09:16,000
empowering it's just i guess flipper

297
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:17,680
it's exhausting living that lie all the

298
00:09:17,680 --> 00:09:19,360
time right so if you're not being

299
00:09:19,360 --> 00:09:20,880
yourself it's just so

300
00:09:20,880 --> 00:09:22,480
dissatisfying to be able to do that to

301
00:09:22,480 --> 00:09:24,000
bring itself to work

302
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:26,160
means that you can i guess i don't know

303
00:09:26,160 --> 00:09:28,080
i think it blocks in every way like if

304
00:09:28,080 --> 00:09:28,959
you're lying to yourself

305
00:09:28,959 --> 00:09:31,120
it shows in every way so just get rid of

306
00:09:31,120 --> 00:09:32,480
that you know to create that environment

307
00:09:32,480 --> 00:09:34,640
people can come to work and

308
00:09:34,640 --> 00:09:36,720
feel authentic i guess the whole self

309
00:09:36,720 --> 00:09:37,600
that means you're getting the real

310
00:09:37,600 --> 00:09:39,279
people the diverse people i don't know i

311
00:09:39,279 --> 00:09:40,640
mean it's not even about the diversity

312
00:09:40,640 --> 00:09:41,600
it's just

313
00:09:41,600 --> 00:09:43,760
i hated living a lie so i think this one

314
00:09:43,760 --> 00:09:44,880
really resonates with me because you

315
00:09:44,880 --> 00:09:46,320
just

316
00:09:46,320 --> 00:09:48,000
it sucks i don't know what else to say

317
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:50,080
on that one so safe to say if if you've

318
00:09:50,080 --> 00:09:51,600
got an organization where people aren't

319
00:09:51,600 --> 00:09:53,040
feeling welcome or they don't feel like

320
00:09:53,040 --> 00:09:53,360
they're

321
00:09:53,360 --> 00:09:55,120
they're true that the reality that they

322
00:09:55,120 --> 00:09:57,440
that they feel best in living

323
00:09:57,440 --> 00:09:59,360
is constrained then then of course

324
00:09:59,360 --> 00:10:00,959
they're not going to be available to do

325
00:10:00,959 --> 00:10:02,079
their best work and

326
00:10:02,079 --> 00:10:04,160
connects deeply and lean in to the

327
00:10:04,160 --> 00:10:05,760
mission of what they're doing together

328
00:10:05,760 --> 00:10:06,800
if they don't feel

329
00:10:06,800 --> 00:10:08,880
feel safe or they don't feel welcome

330
00:10:08,880 --> 00:10:10,079
yeah

331
00:10:10,079 --> 00:10:12,079
sorry yeah no i think even more deeply

332
00:10:12,079 --> 00:10:13,600
too it's like i can think of some

333
00:10:13,600 --> 00:10:14,880
organizations where i'd probably be a

334
00:10:14,880 --> 00:10:16,800
bit apprehensive about coming out again

335
00:10:16,800 --> 00:10:18,480
still even though i might not be as

336
00:10:18,480 --> 00:10:20,720
openly uh open about my sexuality it

337
00:10:20,720 --> 00:10:21,600
might be like ah

338
00:10:21,600 --> 00:10:23,440
maybe isn't as relevant and i maybe

339
00:10:23,440 --> 00:10:24,880
might start to stifle it

340
00:10:24,880 --> 00:10:26,480
um which is straight away like a red

341
00:10:26,480 --> 00:10:28,320
flag red flag red flag and it's like oh

342
00:10:28,320 --> 00:10:29,839
i'm regressing no and that's like

343
00:10:29,839 --> 00:10:31,120
no straight away you won't be doing the

344
00:10:31,120 --> 00:10:33,600
best work so an organization like sneak

345
00:10:33,600 --> 00:10:34,079
where i

346
00:10:34,079 --> 00:10:36,320
didn't ever feel like i had to sort of

347
00:10:36,320 --> 00:10:37,360
dim my light or

348
00:10:37,360 --> 00:10:39,279
my honest self is really really

349
00:10:39,279 --> 00:10:40,399
important

350
00:10:40,399 --> 00:10:41,839
i think that's a great way to put it

351
00:10:41,839 --> 00:10:43,920
like if you if you really want to create

352
00:10:43,920 --> 00:10:44,959
a high voltage

353
00:10:44,959 --> 00:10:48,399
successful energetic connected culture

354
00:10:48,399 --> 00:10:50,720
then then if people feel unsafe that

355
00:10:50,720 --> 00:10:52,160
that light's going to remain dim

356
00:10:52,160 --> 00:10:54,959
and and no no company with dim lights

357
00:10:54,959 --> 00:10:55,839
are sustainable

358
00:10:55,839 --> 00:10:58,240
it that of all the ones i've worked for

359
00:10:58,240 --> 00:10:59,200
that

360
00:10:59,200 --> 00:11:00,640
that weren't welcoming they're they're

361
00:11:00,640 --> 00:11:02,959
light dimmed uh and and so did their

362
00:11:02,959 --> 00:11:05,279
business

363
00:11:05,600 --> 00:11:08,480
so heidi violation i could see direct

364
00:11:08,480 --> 00:11:09,440
correlation heidi

365
00:11:09,440 --> 00:11:10,880
do you have a thought here on on this

366
00:11:10,880 --> 00:11:12,720
notion of whole self

367
00:11:12,720 --> 00:11:15,200
yeah absolutely 100 but this goes into

368
00:11:15,200 --> 00:11:16,240
everything that i

369
00:11:16,240 --> 00:11:18,240
shout about on a day-to-day basis you

370
00:11:18,240 --> 00:11:19,920
know i do a lot of public speaking in

371
00:11:19,920 --> 00:11:20,800
other forums

372
00:11:20,800 --> 00:11:22,399
which is about actually how we're

373
00:11:22,399 --> 00:11:25,360
responsible each of us in in the hiring

374
00:11:25,360 --> 00:11:26,000
process

375
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:29,040
to highlight what a company's about

376
00:11:29,040 --> 00:11:30,800
and here at sneak i talk about the fact

377
00:11:30,800 --> 00:11:33,600
that we are a business built by humans

378
00:11:33,600 --> 00:11:36,640
who hire humans to bring their full self

379
00:11:36,640 --> 00:11:38,320
and if you feel in any way that that's

380
00:11:38,320 --> 00:11:40,560
an environment you won't flourish in

381
00:11:40,560 --> 00:11:42,399
then you need to you need to evaluate is

382
00:11:42,399 --> 00:11:44,160
this somewhere that i should be

383
00:11:44,160 --> 00:11:47,200
whereas if we constantly open up um you

384
00:11:47,200 --> 00:11:48,880
know i know on glassdoor someone wrote

385
00:11:48,880 --> 00:11:49,600
sneak is

386
00:11:49,600 --> 00:11:51,440
interviewing at sneak is like looking

387
00:11:51,440 --> 00:11:53,600
through a pane of glass it's transparent

388
00:11:53,600 --> 00:11:54,959
if we were maintain this this

389
00:11:54,959 --> 00:11:56,560
transparency around

390
00:11:56,560 --> 00:11:58,480
the fact that we we are a welcoming

391
00:11:58,480 --> 00:11:59,680
company we

392
00:11:59,680 --> 00:12:02,399
are open to learning about every you

393
00:12:02,399 --> 00:12:03,680
know differing

394
00:12:03,680 --> 00:12:05,519
community that's out there whether that

395
00:12:05,519 --> 00:12:07,519
is the the subject that we're talking

396
00:12:07,519 --> 00:12:09,120
about today or something else

397
00:12:09,120 --> 00:12:11,120
if we maintain those values of

398
00:12:11,120 --> 00:12:13,040
constantly having that open

399
00:12:13,040 --> 00:12:16,000
open arm environment i think yeah

400
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:17,680
absolutely that's that's where people

401
00:12:17,680 --> 00:12:18,959
can flourish

402
00:12:18,959 --> 00:12:21,760
and are there are there topics that that

403
00:12:21,760 --> 00:12:23,519
at times and nathan i'll direct this one

404
00:12:23,519 --> 00:12:24,160
at you

405
00:12:24,160 --> 00:12:27,040
just as as you identify as a gay male

406
00:12:27,040 --> 00:12:27,360
are

407
00:12:27,360 --> 00:12:29,519
are there topics that that can be seen

408
00:12:29,519 --> 00:12:30,959
as offensive are there things that dim

409
00:12:30,959 --> 00:12:32,320
your light are there things that shut

410
00:12:32,320 --> 00:12:34,160
you down that that people in businesses

411
00:12:34,160 --> 00:12:35,440
need to be aware of especially in

412
00:12:35,440 --> 00:12:36,480
businesses that are

413
00:12:36,480 --> 00:12:38,320
maybe less receptive but are trying hard

414
00:12:38,320 --> 00:12:39,920
to learn about allyship

415
00:12:39,920 --> 00:12:42,959
you know as a step toward more inclusion

416
00:12:42,959 --> 00:12:45,040
yeah good great question i think i'm

417
00:12:45,040 --> 00:12:46,399
like first time i won't try and speak

418
00:12:46,399 --> 00:12:47,760
for everyone on this right i'm just one

419
00:12:47,760 --> 00:12:48,880
person with my own

420
00:12:48,880 --> 00:12:52,160
views here and i

421
00:12:52,160 --> 00:12:53,920
won't sort of try and take credit for

422
00:12:53,920 --> 00:12:55,360
all the work that's been done before me

423
00:12:55,360 --> 00:12:57,120
by you know countless allies and

424
00:12:57,120 --> 00:12:59,120
champions and trans people and gay men

425
00:12:59,120 --> 00:12:59,680
and

426
00:12:59,680 --> 00:13:02,240
women and everyone doing that in the

427
00:13:02,240 --> 00:13:03,120
past but

428
00:13:03,120 --> 00:13:06,639
um for me i think it's really important

429
00:13:06,639 --> 00:13:08,079
to think through the intent behind what

430
00:13:08,079 --> 00:13:09,519
people are trying to achieve here right

431
00:13:09,519 --> 00:13:10,560
so like if people are

432
00:13:10,560 --> 00:13:12,880
curious and want to learn like that's

433
00:13:12,880 --> 00:13:14,399
that's really really good

434
00:13:14,399 --> 00:13:16,160
equally i think there's intent but then

435
00:13:16,160 --> 00:13:17,760
there's also how you deliver it too and

436
00:13:17,760 --> 00:13:19,360
i think um

437
00:13:19,360 --> 00:13:21,519
certain subjects or certain things can

438
00:13:21,519 --> 00:13:23,040
offend and will offend depending on how

439
00:13:23,040 --> 00:13:24,720
they're framed and i think

440
00:13:24,720 --> 00:13:26,639
depending on where you're going with it

441
00:13:26,639 --> 00:13:28,320
i mean like

442
00:13:28,320 --> 00:13:29,680
certain topics depending on the nature

443
00:13:29,680 --> 00:13:32,639
like i i think like

444
00:13:32,639 --> 00:13:34,399
taking it as a contextual thing

445
00:13:34,399 --> 00:13:35,760
sometimes people get curious about the

446
00:13:35,760 --> 00:13:36,959
sex especially but it's like would you

447
00:13:36,959 --> 00:13:38,240
ask a straight person that question i

448
00:13:38,240 --> 00:13:39,279
think is always a really really good

449
00:13:39,279 --> 00:13:41,120
rule to have there you know or i mean is

450
00:13:41,120 --> 00:13:43,120
it appropriate for work or i guess think

451
00:13:43,120 --> 00:13:44,480
that through you know

452
00:13:44,480 --> 00:13:45,920
um if you wouldn't ask it to a straight

453
00:13:45,920 --> 00:13:47,519
person i wouldn't ask it to i wouldn't

454
00:13:47,519 --> 00:13:49,040
raise it as a topic for someone else it

455
00:13:49,040 --> 00:13:50,399
just seems what's the point

456
00:13:50,399 --> 00:13:52,480
again equally if you are curious to

457
00:13:52,480 --> 00:13:53,920
learn about things you can frame them in

458
00:13:53,920 --> 00:13:54,959
a way that is like

459
00:13:54,959 --> 00:13:56,160
a lot of people are keen to share and

460
00:13:56,160 --> 00:13:57,600
discuss their views and knowledge and

461
00:13:57,600 --> 00:13:58,720
help educate too

462
00:13:58,720 --> 00:14:00,800
so i think it comes down to yeah yeah

463
00:14:00,800 --> 00:14:03,120
intent

464
00:14:03,360 --> 00:14:05,680
so that the intent and having the

465
00:14:05,680 --> 00:14:07,680
positive intent as opposed to maybe

466
00:14:07,680 --> 00:14:09,440
just like writing a stereotype directly

467
00:14:09,440 --> 00:14:10,720
into a conversation or

468
00:14:10,720 --> 00:14:12,959
or or venturing too quickly into

469
00:14:12,959 --> 00:14:13,920
territory that

470
00:14:13,920 --> 00:14:17,440
that that that maybe isn't safe or isn't

471
00:14:17,440 --> 00:14:18,959
isn't it is a place where all parties

472
00:14:18,959 --> 00:14:20,320
involved in that conversation feel that

473
00:14:20,320 --> 00:14:22,399
same intent that positive

474
00:14:22,399 --> 00:14:25,600
yeah you'd be to try and like

475
00:14:25,600 --> 00:14:27,040
get to know someone care about them

476
00:14:27,040 --> 00:14:28,399
understand them better right it

477
00:14:28,399 --> 00:14:30,160
shouldn't be like a

478
00:14:30,160 --> 00:14:32,000
a grotesque fascination or something

479
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:33,760
that some people have or something like

480
00:14:33,760 --> 00:14:35,600
that you know that's just completely off

481
00:14:35,600 --> 00:14:37,199
and that will land and that will show

482
00:14:37,199 --> 00:14:38,480
and that'll read and that's straight

483
00:14:38,480 --> 00:14:40,160
away just an offensive conference like

484
00:14:40,160 --> 00:14:40,880
it's just not

485
00:14:40,880 --> 00:14:44,160
on um yeah

486
00:14:44,160 --> 00:14:45,600
yeah there's not much else to play on

487
00:14:45,600 --> 00:14:46,720
that one right it's just like if it's

488
00:14:46,720 --> 00:14:48,240
wrong it's just wrong and it's really

489
00:14:48,240 --> 00:14:48,959
bad

490
00:14:48,959 --> 00:14:51,680
now are there are there are there ways

491
00:14:51,680 --> 00:14:53,199
and heidi i'll bring you in on this

492
00:14:53,199 --> 00:14:54,000
thread as well

493
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:56,160
are there things that you know are are

494
00:14:56,160 --> 00:14:57,120
less appropriate

495
00:14:57,120 --> 00:14:58,800
even though i think the three of us are

496
00:14:58,800 --> 00:15:00,800
very animated people we're very

497
00:15:00,800 --> 00:15:02,639
open-minded people we're very open

498
00:15:02,639 --> 00:15:04,320
generally um

499
00:15:04,320 --> 00:15:06,160
which isn't always overly corporate but

500
00:15:06,160 --> 00:15:07,760
but but that said are there are there

501
00:15:07,760 --> 00:15:09,279
things that are quote-unquote corporate

502
00:15:09,279 --> 00:15:10,320
but are there are there

503
00:15:10,320 --> 00:15:11,519
are there things that are just flat

504
00:15:11,519 --> 00:15:13,199
inappropriate that people out there need

505
00:15:13,199 --> 00:15:14,720
to be aware of in their in their company

506
00:15:14,720 --> 00:15:15,760
cultures

507
00:15:15,760 --> 00:15:17,839
absolutely and i think i think nathan

508
00:15:17,839 --> 00:15:19,279
hit it on the head there which is if you

509
00:15:19,279 --> 00:15:20,000
wouldn't ask

510
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:21,600
you know a straight person it don't

511
00:15:21,600 --> 00:15:24,079
don't ask the community of lgbtq right

512
00:15:24,079 --> 00:15:26,240
and i think that's part of it i think i

513
00:15:26,240 --> 00:15:27,600
think the one thing i'd take away is

514
00:15:27,600 --> 00:15:28,959
that everyone always has the best

515
00:15:28,959 --> 00:15:29,839
intentions

516
00:15:29,839 --> 00:15:31,120
i don't think anyone comes into a

517
00:15:31,120 --> 00:15:32,959
conversation and goes hey so how gay

518
00:15:32,959 --> 00:15:36,000
actually are you with the idea of hey i

519
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:37,199
just want to i want to be a bit

520
00:15:37,199 --> 00:15:39,199
malicious here or stir that pot i think

521
00:15:39,199 --> 00:15:40,160
it's a case of

522
00:15:40,160 --> 00:15:41,360
you know actually i want to educate

523
00:15:41,360 --> 00:15:44,000
myself but actually it's done in a forum

524
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:44,639
that is

525
00:15:44,639 --> 00:15:46,320
not conventional it's just not

526
00:15:46,320 --> 00:15:47,680
acceptable right if you're doing it in

527
00:15:47,680 --> 00:15:49,199
front of other people you might be you

528
00:15:49,199 --> 00:15:50,720
might be seen as doing it for a reaction

529
00:15:50,720 --> 00:15:52,160
or to get attention because

530
00:15:52,160 --> 00:15:53,839
somebody else has attention and so

531
00:15:53,839 --> 00:15:55,120
therefore you want to kind of like pull

532
00:15:55,120 --> 00:15:56,560
it back to you a little bit or share

533
00:15:56,560 --> 00:15:57,600
that light

534
00:15:57,600 --> 00:15:59,600
and and that's not not always the best i

535
00:15:59,600 --> 00:16:00,800
think the best

536
00:16:00,800 --> 00:16:02,399
way to approach this and i'm sure we've

537
00:16:02,399 --> 00:16:04,480
seen this in in our lives is that

538
00:16:04,480 --> 00:16:05,600
actually

539
00:16:05,600 --> 00:16:07,600
taking someone away from the scenario

540
00:16:07,600 --> 00:16:08,639
and going look you know

541
00:16:08,639 --> 00:16:10,160
you've obviously welcomed me into a

542
00:16:10,160 --> 00:16:11,839
situation here where you shared a piece

543
00:16:11,839 --> 00:16:13,120
of information

544
00:16:13,120 --> 00:16:15,440
you know how would you like me to refer

545
00:16:15,440 --> 00:16:16,160
to this

546
00:16:16,160 --> 00:16:18,000
you know some people are a case of you

547
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:19,440
know what i'm gay i'm proud and i'm

548
00:16:19,440 --> 00:16:20,720
happy to talk about it

549
00:16:20,720 --> 00:16:22,800
you can talk about it and i'm not shy

550
00:16:22,800 --> 00:16:24,079
awesome that's great

551
00:16:24,079 --> 00:16:26,079
however unless somebody's categorically

552
00:16:26,079 --> 00:16:27,279
told you that

553
00:16:27,279 --> 00:16:28,720
then as far as you're concerned you

554
00:16:28,720 --> 00:16:30,079
shouldn't really be talking about it at

555
00:16:30,079 --> 00:16:32,399
all somebody else's business is there

556
00:16:32,399 --> 00:16:34,079
a lot like how you know if you know a

557
00:16:34,079 --> 00:16:35,920
colleague's parent might be ill you're

558
00:16:35,920 --> 00:16:37,120
not going to go and tell

559
00:16:37,120 --> 00:16:38,959
another colleague oh by the way so and

560
00:16:38,959 --> 00:16:40,720
so is dad's sick you know you would you

561
00:16:40,720 --> 00:16:42,639
just wouldn't do it you you just don't

562
00:16:42,639 --> 00:16:44,480
talk about that third party unless that

563
00:16:44,480 --> 00:16:46,240
person's explicitly giving you

564
00:16:46,240 --> 00:16:47,360
permission

565
00:16:47,360 --> 00:16:49,279
um and then there's the obvious you know

566
00:16:49,279 --> 00:16:51,040
don't reference point things that you're

567
00:16:51,040 --> 00:16:52,880
not really that understanding of

568
00:16:52,880 --> 00:16:55,360
education is key um and i think there's

569
00:16:55,360 --> 00:16:56,320
a way of of

570
00:16:56,320 --> 00:16:58,320
asking questions as well there was

571
00:16:58,320 --> 00:16:59,759
something actually i saw this weekend

572
00:16:59,759 --> 00:17:01,120
which was lizzo i don't know whether

573
00:17:01,120 --> 00:17:03,199
you've seen this on instagram

574
00:17:03,199 --> 00:17:06,240
where uh photographer jimmy lovato yeah

575
00:17:06,240 --> 00:17:07,919
demi lovato right and there's alright

576
00:17:07,919 --> 00:17:09,439
keep talking i loved it though

577
00:17:09,439 --> 00:17:12,000
yeah yeah so this photographer's like

578
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:14,400
hey so lizzo is this aimed at her is

579
00:17:14,400 --> 00:17:14,720
this

580
00:17:14,720 --> 00:17:17,039
aimed at demi lovato and lizzo without

581
00:17:17,039 --> 00:17:18,400
skipping a beat was like hold on a

582
00:17:18,400 --> 00:17:19,280
second

583
00:17:19,280 --> 00:17:21,839
they refer to themselves as they so stop

584
00:17:21,839 --> 00:17:23,359
saying that don't stay

585
00:17:23,359 --> 00:17:25,919
and it was like this just immediate

586
00:17:25,919 --> 00:17:27,520
allyship of

587
00:17:27,520 --> 00:17:29,039
hold on a second you're using a

588
00:17:29,039 --> 00:17:31,440
reference term that you haven't educated

589
00:17:31,440 --> 00:17:32,080
yourself

590
00:17:32,080 --> 00:17:34,400
on so if you can see that somebody's

591
00:17:34,400 --> 00:17:36,080
opened up enough to say that

592
00:17:36,080 --> 00:17:38,320
this is either a reference or who i am

593
00:17:38,320 --> 00:17:39,280
or whatever

594
00:17:39,280 --> 00:17:42,080
never turn around and discredit that

595
00:17:42,080 --> 00:17:43,840
especially in another forum does that

596
00:17:43,840 --> 00:17:44,160
make

597
00:17:44,160 --> 00:17:45,760
sense like there's a way of handling

598
00:17:45,760 --> 00:17:47,760
yourself and holding yourself

599
00:17:47,760 --> 00:17:50,799
where education is key throughout all of

600
00:17:50,799 --> 00:17:52,880
your interactions

601
00:17:52,880 --> 00:17:56,240
i think that that that that then is is a

602
00:17:56,240 --> 00:17:58,160
really great bridge into the last topic

603
00:17:58,160 --> 00:18:00,240
team and that is

604
00:18:00,240 --> 00:18:02,640
most organizations have multiple layers

605
00:18:02,640 --> 00:18:04,080
of management therefore there are going

606
00:18:04,080 --> 00:18:05,520
to be dynamics where you do have a

607
00:18:05,520 --> 00:18:07,039
manager

608
00:18:07,039 --> 00:18:09,600
or a supervisor and a team are there are

609
00:18:09,600 --> 00:18:11,120
there specific

610
00:18:11,120 --> 00:18:13,760
tips or thoughts about that dynamic

611
00:18:13,760 --> 00:18:16,160
where a manager can either facilitate

612
00:18:16,160 --> 00:18:19,520
allyship and inclusion or the opposite

613
00:18:19,520 --> 00:18:21,360
and are there are there here as we go

614
00:18:21,360 --> 00:18:22,960
out just any thoughts around

615
00:18:22,960 --> 00:18:25,039
whether it be resources or ways that

616
00:18:25,039 --> 00:18:27,280
teams operate or managers can operate in

617
00:18:27,280 --> 00:18:28,320
his or her

618
00:18:28,320 --> 00:18:31,120
uh or their uh you know way of of being

619
00:18:31,120 --> 00:18:32,720
a manager that that's optimal

620
00:18:32,720 --> 00:18:34,320
and i think that that sort of like tips

621
00:18:34,320 --> 00:18:35,840
and tricks for managers or thoughts

622
00:18:35,840 --> 00:18:37,679
about that dynamic the team environment

623
00:18:37,679 --> 00:18:39,280
the team dynamic would be a really great

624
00:18:39,280 --> 00:18:41,440
kind of topic to go out on here

625
00:18:41,440 --> 00:18:42,960
any thoughts from from either of the two

626
00:18:42,960 --> 00:18:44,960
of you on this and then we can

627
00:18:44,960 --> 00:18:48,320
we can uh kind of wrap up

628
00:18:48,320 --> 00:18:50,000
yeah sorry my brain just went on a

629
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:51,039
tangent then too i started thinking

630
00:18:51,039 --> 00:18:52,480
about all these other things too like i

631
00:18:52,480 --> 00:18:53,520
started thinking like

632
00:18:53,520 --> 00:18:55,360
like heidi would think strongly about

633
00:18:55,360 --> 00:18:56,799
like

634
00:18:56,799 --> 00:18:58,400
it's really important to have a great

635
00:18:58,400 --> 00:19:00,320
diverse team right as well the offset

636
00:19:00,320 --> 00:19:00,640
right

637
00:19:00,640 --> 00:19:02,799
higher start there yeah start with

638
00:19:02,799 --> 00:19:04,320
recruiting a diverse team that

639
00:19:04,320 --> 00:19:05,760
puts you in an inspiration in the first

640
00:19:05,760 --> 00:19:07,360
place to have these uh yeah

641
00:19:07,360 --> 00:19:08,480
and i started thinking about that and i

642
00:19:08,480 --> 00:19:09,440
was like that's not even my area that's

643
00:19:09,440 --> 00:19:10,799
heidi's i just shut up because that's

644
00:19:10,799 --> 00:19:14,080
here to talk about but you know

645
00:19:15,440 --> 00:19:18,720
right fantastic that you think that way

646
00:19:18,720 --> 00:19:20,480
though because you yourself is so

647
00:19:20,480 --> 00:19:22,799
important within the people ops you know

648
00:19:22,799 --> 00:19:24,240
it is at that very course so it's

649
00:19:24,240 --> 00:19:26,640
wonderful to think that even you

650
00:19:26,640 --> 00:19:29,039
you know not not doing my role know that

651
00:19:29,039 --> 00:19:30,480
actually that's how we

652
00:19:30,480 --> 00:19:32,240
how we breed that culture right and

653
00:19:32,240 --> 00:19:34,240
that's just another sneak value which is

654
00:19:34,240 --> 00:19:36,559
we just think that way intrinsic in our

655
00:19:36,559 --> 00:19:37,679
values

656
00:19:37,679 --> 00:19:40,320
but starting with the right foundations

657
00:19:40,320 --> 00:19:41,840
of a really awesome diverse team but

658
00:19:41,840 --> 00:19:43,760
also secondly

659
00:19:43,760 --> 00:19:46,320
i mean i work with managers a lot and

660
00:19:46,320 --> 00:19:48,000
the best here is to genuinely care about

661
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:49,440
the stuff and i mean i work with a lot

662
00:19:49,440 --> 00:19:50,880
of managers and i would a lot of managed

663
00:19:50,880 --> 00:19:51,679
to

664
00:19:51,679 --> 00:19:53,039
steer i say i've only become managers

665
00:19:53,039 --> 00:19:53,919
because i think it's the best way to

666
00:19:53,919 --> 00:19:54,720
make more money

667
00:19:54,720 --> 00:19:56,720
and i'm my advice to you is don't become

668
00:19:56,720 --> 00:19:58,080
a manager if you just want more money

669
00:19:58,080 --> 00:19:59,120
there's plenty of other ways to earn

670
00:19:59,120 --> 00:20:00,000
really good cash

671
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:02,000
like if you want to create a

672
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:03,840
psychological safe environment for your

673
00:20:03,840 --> 00:20:04,480
teams

674
00:20:04,480 --> 00:20:06,000
care about it and that means being a

675
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:07,120
really good manager caring about your

676
00:20:07,120 --> 00:20:08,960
people taking genuine interest in them

677
00:20:08,960 --> 00:20:10,880
and their pains concerns getting to know

678
00:20:10,880 --> 00:20:11,600
them

679
00:20:11,600 --> 00:20:14,000
learning what you know educating

680
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:15,200
yourself on your people regardless of

681
00:20:15,200 --> 00:20:16,720
whether the lgbtq plus or

682
00:20:16,720 --> 00:20:19,120
you know anything it could be uh

683
00:20:19,120 --> 00:20:20,559
ethnicity it could be

684
00:20:20,559 --> 00:20:23,039
a so many spectrum of diversity right

685
00:20:23,039 --> 00:20:25,039
get to know them take a genuine interest

686
00:20:25,039 --> 00:20:26,799
and foster that continued sort of

687
00:20:26,799 --> 00:20:28,480
diverse knowledge and sharing with the

688
00:20:28,480 --> 00:20:29,760
team i think that creates a safe

689
00:20:29,760 --> 00:20:30,480
environment

690
00:20:30,480 --> 00:20:32,240
i love that just create that safety

691
00:20:32,240 --> 00:20:33,840
through curiosity and through creating

692
00:20:33,840 --> 00:20:35,360
the environment through interest through

693
00:20:35,360 --> 00:20:36,720
through through caring through

694
00:20:36,720 --> 00:20:38,480
compassion that that's that's powerful

695
00:20:38,480 --> 00:20:39,440
advice heidi

696
00:20:39,440 --> 00:20:40,799
do you have organizational things to

697
00:20:40,799 --> 00:20:42,960
layer on top of that i would just say

698
00:20:42,960 --> 00:20:45,039
educate yourself right we have so many

699
00:20:45,039 --> 00:20:47,280
resources ourselves but for other people

700
00:20:47,280 --> 00:20:48,880
who might not have zoos within their

701
00:20:48,880 --> 00:20:49,600
company

702
00:20:49,600 --> 00:20:51,679
set them up don't be afraid to start

703
00:20:51,679 --> 00:20:53,919
like we have sneak resource groups

704
00:20:53,919 --> 00:20:55,840
give people the opportunity to start

705
00:20:55,840 --> 00:20:57,200
their own community

706
00:20:57,200 --> 00:20:59,600
internal to yours where you welcome that

707
00:20:59,600 --> 00:21:00,320
you know

708
00:21:00,320 --> 00:21:03,360
set up these practices for non-bias set

709
00:21:03,360 --> 00:21:05,280
up practices for changing mindset it's

710
00:21:05,280 --> 00:21:06,960
all about education because absolutely

711
00:21:06,960 --> 00:21:08,320
caring is at the core

712
00:21:08,320 --> 00:21:09,919
you've got to care enough to educate

713
00:21:09,919 --> 00:21:12,000
yourself you can't just go in blind with

714
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:13,120
thinking

715
00:21:13,120 --> 00:21:14,880
you know yeah we can change things

716
00:21:14,880 --> 00:21:16,080
because because that's not always going

717
00:21:16,080 --> 00:21:17,200
to be the way to do it you've got to

718
00:21:17,200 --> 00:21:19,280
educate yourself on that path to success

719
00:21:19,280 --> 00:21:20,960
and we've certainly got it here

720
00:21:20,960 --> 00:21:22,559
but i think other people need to work on

721
00:21:22,559 --> 00:21:24,159
how that would work for them in their

722
00:21:24,159 --> 00:21:25,440
company

723
00:21:25,440 --> 00:21:28,720
so it's it's being willing to to adopt a

724
00:21:28,720 --> 00:21:30,480
caring compassionate perspective as a

725
00:21:30,480 --> 00:21:33,280
manager and it's being willing to humbly

726
00:21:33,280 --> 00:21:35,039
educate yourself and not put the burden

727
00:21:35,039 --> 00:21:37,120
per se on on the members of your team

728
00:21:37,120 --> 00:21:38,480
that maybe you're coming from a diverse

729
00:21:38,480 --> 00:21:39,679
background

730
00:21:39,679 --> 00:21:41,440
or a less traditional path into their

731
00:21:41,440 --> 00:21:43,520
role it's it's about educating yourself

732
00:21:43,520 --> 00:21:44,799
on their context

733
00:21:44,799 --> 00:21:46,720
perhaps to to ask the right questions to

734
00:21:46,720 --> 00:21:47,840
create that

735
00:21:47,840 --> 00:21:50,320
that dynamic that's gonna flow uh and

736
00:21:50,320 --> 00:21:52,320
not not dim lights and not not shut

737
00:21:52,320 --> 00:21:53,360
people down

738
00:21:53,360 --> 00:21:54,880
any other thoughts in closing about

739
00:21:54,880 --> 00:21:56,720
allyship team we've got you know

740
00:21:56,720 --> 00:21:58,080
what will be a lot of people that listen

741
00:21:58,080 --> 00:22:00,400
to this video or any tips as we go out

742
00:22:00,400 --> 00:22:00,720
on

743
00:22:00,720 --> 00:22:03,280
on what allyship really does require i'm

744
00:22:03,280 --> 00:22:03,840
hearing

745
00:22:03,840 --> 00:22:06,400
care deeply i'm hearing educate yourself

746
00:22:06,400 --> 00:22:07,520
i'm hearing

747
00:22:07,520 --> 00:22:09,440
create surround surround you know kind

748
00:22:09,440 --> 00:22:11,840
of equity and equality and inclusion

749
00:22:11,840 --> 00:22:14,080
in your systems and around around

750
00:22:14,080 --> 00:22:15,039
yourselves but

751
00:22:15,039 --> 00:22:17,440
are there any other things or or books

752
00:22:17,440 --> 00:22:18,159
or

753
00:22:18,159 --> 00:22:20,799
or tapes or providers or organizations

754
00:22:20,799 --> 00:22:21,760
or anything that we need

755
00:22:21,760 --> 00:22:23,440
to reference as we go out no pressure

756
00:22:23,440 --> 00:22:24,960
just wanted allyship and

757
00:22:24,960 --> 00:22:26,880
and living that allies lifestyle gets

758
00:22:26,880 --> 00:22:30,159
one more tip from you as we go

759
00:22:30,159 --> 00:22:31,200
yeah there's always going to be

760
00:22:31,200 --> 00:22:33,039
references right where you can look

761
00:22:33,039 --> 00:22:34,960
online so there are communities and

762
00:22:34,960 --> 00:22:36,480
websites that you can look at

763
00:22:36,480 --> 00:22:39,280
so there's a lot to do with trans so for

764
00:22:39,280 --> 00:22:41,360
people who suffer from transphobia or

765
00:22:41,360 --> 00:22:43,360
going through transitions for themselves

766
00:22:43,360 --> 00:22:45,360
that is one serious place that i always

767
00:22:45,360 --> 00:22:46,880
look to start because that's

768
00:22:46,880 --> 00:22:50,000
that's a huge embodiment um i definitely

769
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:51,440
would would look at that as a resource

770
00:22:51,440 --> 00:22:52,480
but that's more uk

771
00:22:52,480 --> 00:22:54,559
based um however there's going to be

772
00:22:54,559 --> 00:22:55,919
international forums

773
00:22:55,919 --> 00:22:58,799
everywhere that you look makes total

774
00:22:58,799 --> 00:23:00,400
sense so basically just get online no

775
00:23:00,400 --> 00:23:02,240
more excuses there's plenty of resources

776
00:23:02,240 --> 00:23:02,880
available

777
00:23:02,880 --> 00:23:05,360
with one google search and i think that

778
00:23:05,360 --> 00:23:06,320
that's that's

779
00:23:06,320 --> 00:23:08,880
that's valuable uh advice nathan

780
00:23:08,880 --> 00:23:10,000
anything from you on

781
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:12,000
on how people listening can be better

782
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:14,000
allies or or any other tools resources

783
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:15,520
or organizations that are good to

784
00:23:15,520 --> 00:23:17,120
mention in this space

785
00:23:17,120 --> 00:23:18,559
i could uh yeah i mean as you can hide

786
00:23:18,559 --> 00:23:20,000
in seats for them i mean we're talking

787
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:22,320
to a global audience here look for what

788
00:23:22,320 --> 00:23:24,000
you need right research on the internet

789
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:26,400
um really good information talk to i

790
00:23:26,400 --> 00:23:28,000
guess your networks as well

791
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:29,280
try to foster that a piece of

792
00:23:29,280 --> 00:23:31,440
environment there through that and

793
00:23:31,440 --> 00:23:33,520
i mean we were partly lucky in some

794
00:23:33,520 --> 00:23:34,480
respects and that

795
00:23:34,480 --> 00:23:36,559
like some of the stuff grew organically

796
00:23:36,559 --> 00:23:38,640
in our organization as well so

797
00:23:38,640 --> 00:23:40,559
really i guess nurture that stuff if you

798
00:23:40,559 --> 00:23:42,480
get like grass roots popping up anywhere

799
00:23:42,480 --> 00:23:44,000
you know don't don't don't read them

800
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:45,440
just try and really nurture them and i

801
00:23:45,440 --> 00:23:46,159
guess be that

802
00:23:46,159 --> 00:23:47,760
a platform where you open this up for

803
00:23:47,760 --> 00:23:50,080
them i think that's tremendous advice

804
00:23:50,080 --> 00:23:51,679
i think almost every one of our

805
00:23:51,679 --> 00:23:53,520
organizations be they three people or

806
00:23:53,520 --> 00:23:54,000
three

807
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:56,400
hundred thousand people have that

808
00:23:56,400 --> 00:23:58,000
momentum have that allow

809
00:23:58,000 --> 00:24:00,480
allyship have that safe environment in

810
00:24:00,480 --> 00:24:02,080
our organizations we just need to foster

811
00:24:02,080 --> 00:24:02,320
it

812
00:24:02,320 --> 00:24:04,159
and we need to spread it and we need to

813
00:24:04,159 --> 00:24:05,919
institutionalize it and scale it

814
00:24:05,919 --> 00:24:07,840
so i really appreciated this

00:24:07,840 --> 00:24:09,600
