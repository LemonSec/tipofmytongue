2
00:00:12,240 --> 00:00:12,639
hi

3
00:00:12,639 --> 00:00:15,599
i'm linda from singapore thank you so

4
00:00:15,599 --> 00:00:16,880
much for listening in

5
00:00:16,880 --> 00:00:18,720
i'll be speaking on driving cicd

6
00:00:18,720 --> 00:00:20,560
adoption for distributed installs and

7
00:00:20,560 --> 00:00:23,680
outsource team today

8
00:00:23,680 --> 00:00:25,519
um how this stock will flow is that i'll

9
00:00:25,519 --> 00:00:27,119
start with the background and drivers

10
00:00:27,119 --> 00:00:28,880
where i'll provide the contacts so they

11
00:00:28,880 --> 00:00:30,320
can better understand the rationale

12
00:00:30,320 --> 00:00:31,439
behind the

13
00:00:31,439 --> 00:00:33,360
decision and the actions that we took

14
00:00:33,360 --> 00:00:35,280
i'll then move on to planning execution

15
00:00:35,280 --> 00:00:36,880
we'll cover the barriers that we have

16
00:00:36,880 --> 00:00:38,000
identified and how we've

17
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:40,320
tried to overcome them i'll then end off

18
00:00:40,320 --> 00:00:41,920
with our challenges and next step where

19
00:00:41,920 --> 00:00:43,440
i'll talk about the challenges that we

20
00:00:43,440 --> 00:00:44,320
still face

21
00:00:44,320 --> 00:00:47,200
and what we plan to do in the year ahead

22
00:00:47,200 --> 00:00:48,559
overall i do not believe that there's

23
00:00:48,559 --> 00:00:50,000
any civil bullet here

24
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:52,079
as every organization has its own unique

25
00:00:52,079 --> 00:00:53,600
context and issues

26
00:00:53,600 --> 00:00:55,280
however what i'm hoping for is that

27
00:00:55,280 --> 00:00:57,039
whatever i shared here today

28
00:00:57,039 --> 00:00:59,199
will give you more ideas of what you can

29
00:00:59,199 --> 00:01:00,480
consider doing

30
00:01:00,480 --> 00:01:02,239
and what you can because they're not

31
00:01:02,239 --> 00:01:04,159
doing in your organization as you're

32
00:01:04,159 --> 00:01:04,879
planning for

33
00:01:04,879 --> 00:01:06,560
or if you're adopting ci cd in

34
00:01:06,560 --> 00:01:08,720
organization

35
00:01:08,720 --> 00:01:09,840
okay now let me start with the

36
00:01:09,840 --> 00:01:12,159
background and drivers

37
00:01:12,159 --> 00:01:14,799
so daftac is a two thousand plus people

38
00:01:14,799 --> 00:01:16,000
strong

39
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:18,400
i'm part of the gov tech services group

40
00:01:18,400 --> 00:01:20,320
which forward deployed around 1

41
00:01:20,320 --> 00:01:23,520
500 offices to the integral part of 50

42
00:01:23,520 --> 00:01:25,520
over government agencies

43
00:01:25,520 --> 00:01:27,680
where they will digitally transform and

44
00:01:27,680 --> 00:01:29,200
manage i.t systems

45
00:01:29,200 --> 00:01:31,439
for the agency business so as to deliver

46
00:01:31,439 --> 00:01:33,520
value to citizen business and public

47
00:01:33,520 --> 00:01:34,960
officers

48
00:01:34,960 --> 00:01:36,320
i'm not one of those who are forward

49
00:01:36,320 --> 00:01:38,240
deployed to the agencies i'm based at

50
00:01:38,240 --> 00:01:39,759
the headquarter as part of the cluster

51
00:01:39,759 --> 00:01:42,720
and technology management office or ctmo

52
00:01:42,720 --> 00:01:45,520
we are responsible for three key areas

53
00:01:45,520 --> 00:01:47,680
one key area is to promote secure app

54
00:01:47,680 --> 00:01:49,200
development practices

55
00:01:49,200 --> 00:01:51,600
and another area which i need is to

56
00:01:51,600 --> 00:01:52,240
drive

57
00:01:52,240 --> 00:01:54,960
cicd and test automation among 50 plus

58
00:01:54,960 --> 00:01:57,759
agencies

59
00:01:57,840 --> 00:01:59,119
so these are some of the government

60
00:01:59,119 --> 00:02:01,200
agencies that we work with including

61
00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:02,560
ministry of education

62
00:02:02,560 --> 00:02:04,799
ministry of health and the national

63
00:02:04,799 --> 00:02:08,160
environment agency

64
00:02:08,160 --> 00:02:10,318
i joined gulf tech around three plus

65
00:02:10,318 --> 00:02:12,800
years back so this was the landscape

66
00:02:12,800 --> 00:02:13,120
then

67
00:02:13,120 --> 00:02:15,440
through my lens okay the systems are

68
00:02:15,440 --> 00:02:16,560
distributed across

69
00:02:16,560 --> 00:02:19,360
agencies mostly outsourced so the

70
00:02:19,360 --> 00:02:21,200
agencies are dependent on

71
00:02:21,200 --> 00:02:23,840
their vendors and their contractors on

72
00:02:23,840 --> 00:02:25,440
their competencies to

73
00:02:25,440 --> 00:02:28,640
manage these systems it was policies and

74
00:02:28,640 --> 00:02:30,080
compliance driven

75
00:02:30,080 --> 00:02:33,040
so it was um to ensure that the system

76
00:02:33,040 --> 00:02:34,400
is compliant it's a top

77
00:02:34,400 --> 00:02:37,440
priority priority and major focus

78
00:02:37,440 --> 00:02:39,120
there was also internet surfing

79
00:02:39,120 --> 00:02:40,720
separation

80
00:02:40,720 --> 00:02:43,760
where the stations that issued

81
00:02:43,760 --> 00:02:46,000
the government officers to assess the

82
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:47,760
government enterprise network does not

83
00:02:47,760 --> 00:02:50,480
have internet access so in order to

84
00:02:50,480 --> 00:02:51,519
assess the internet

85
00:02:51,519 --> 00:02:53,599
it will require another workstation to

86
00:02:53,599 --> 00:02:55,360
have internet accessibility

87
00:02:55,360 --> 00:02:56,879
so this brings another level of

88
00:02:56,879 --> 00:02:58,560
dimension to

89
00:02:58,560 --> 00:03:00,800
when you design a platform which can be

90
00:03:00,800 --> 00:03:02,480
accessible to both the government

91
00:03:02,480 --> 00:03:03,440
offices

92
00:03:03,440 --> 00:03:06,879
as well as their vendors and contractors

93
00:03:06,879 --> 00:03:09,599
the systems are mostly on-premise hosted

94
00:03:09,599 --> 00:03:11,440
in various government data centers in

95
00:03:11,440 --> 00:03:12,959
singapore

96
00:03:12,959 --> 00:03:14,879
back then there was this rise of asia

97
00:03:14,879 --> 00:03:17,680
where asia was increasingly advocated

98
00:03:17,680 --> 00:03:20,879
to deliver value faster to our citizens

99
00:03:20,879 --> 00:03:22,480
business and

100
00:03:22,480 --> 00:03:25,760
government officers and there was also

101
00:03:25,760 --> 00:03:26,640
this push

102
00:03:26,640 --> 00:03:29,040
to move to cloud to take advantage of

103
00:03:29,040 --> 00:03:30,720
the benefits that cloud can bring such

104
00:03:30,720 --> 00:03:31,120
as

105
00:03:31,120 --> 00:03:34,560
scalability and cost

106
00:03:37,280 --> 00:03:39,360
as uh as i mentioned earlier most of the

107
00:03:39,360 --> 00:03:40,799
systems are outsourced

108
00:03:40,799 --> 00:03:42,720
and there were challenges with

109
00:03:42,720 --> 00:03:44,319
outsourced app development

110
00:03:44,319 --> 00:03:45,840
some of the challenges that i mentioned

111
00:03:45,840 --> 00:03:48,400
here will may also apply to in-house app

112
00:03:48,400 --> 00:03:49,360
development

113
00:03:49,360 --> 00:03:52,560
so firstly uh we see potentially a

114
00:03:52,560 --> 00:03:53,920
control of vendors development

115
00:03:53,920 --> 00:03:54,959
environment

116
00:03:54,959 --> 00:03:56,720
by a vendor development environment i'm

117
00:03:56,720 --> 00:03:58,480
referring to the environment environment

118
00:03:58,480 --> 00:03:59,519
that you

119
00:03:59,519 --> 00:04:02,159
develop build and test your system so

120
00:04:02,159 --> 00:04:04,720
this environment may be on premise

121
00:04:04,720 --> 00:04:07,840
or maybe on cloud is usually

122
00:04:07,840 --> 00:04:10,159
out to the vendor to instill control in

123
00:04:10,159 --> 00:04:11,280
this environment

124
00:04:11,280 --> 00:04:13,680
the agency project team may not have

125
00:04:13,680 --> 00:04:15,200
access to this environment so they

126
00:04:15,200 --> 00:04:16,399
cannot verify

127
00:04:16,399 --> 00:04:19,358
the controls that are in place so if

128
00:04:19,358 --> 00:04:20,959
there are a lot of technical controls it

129
00:04:20,959 --> 00:04:22,160
can lead to potential

130
00:04:22,160 --> 00:04:24,320
issues such as for example source code

131
00:04:24,320 --> 00:04:25,840
repository being

132
00:04:25,840 --> 00:04:28,400
unintentionally public the build server

133
00:04:28,400 --> 00:04:29,600
being compromised

134
00:04:29,600 --> 00:04:32,639
or unpatched or ad hot testing

135
00:04:32,639 --> 00:04:33,919
so some of the issues that i mentioned

136
00:04:33,919 --> 00:04:36,320
here are not new similar issues have

137
00:04:36,320 --> 00:04:38,400
been reported for various companies over

138
00:04:38,400 --> 00:04:39,280
the world

139
00:04:39,280 --> 00:04:42,800
in the past few years there are also

140
00:04:42,800 --> 00:04:44,320
varying tools and development testing

141
00:04:44,320 --> 00:04:46,320
practices uh it can be up to the

142
00:04:46,320 --> 00:04:48,000
development team to decide what tools

143
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:49,120
they want to use

144
00:04:49,120 --> 00:04:50,800
and what practices that they want to

145
00:04:50,800 --> 00:04:52,240
adopt so it can be

146
00:04:52,240 --> 00:04:54,000
challenging for the agency project team

147
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:55,600
to know what to expect

148
00:04:55,600 --> 00:04:58,800
and how to instill governance there can

149
00:04:58,800 --> 00:04:59,360
be no

150
00:04:59,360 --> 00:05:01,199
ownership over the source code so this

151
00:05:01,199 --> 00:05:02,960
is really dependent on the contract

152
00:05:02,960 --> 00:05:04,160
terms

153
00:05:04,160 --> 00:05:05,680
and if there's no ownership over the

154
00:05:05,680 --> 00:05:07,520
source code there can be issues such as

155
00:05:07,520 --> 00:05:08,400
for example

156
00:05:08,400 --> 00:05:10,160
how do you switch vendor if you don't

157
00:05:10,160 --> 00:05:12,000
have the source code or what

158
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:13,680
if the loss code is lost because there

159
00:05:13,680 --> 00:05:15,520
was no proper management of the source

160
00:05:15,520 --> 00:05:16,880
code

161
00:05:16,880 --> 00:05:18,639
there have also been reports of poor

162
00:05:18,639 --> 00:05:22,479
application quality during uat

163
00:05:22,479 --> 00:05:24,160
so due to the varying tools and

164
00:05:24,160 --> 00:05:26,000
development testing practices

165
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:28,000
um there can be inadequate or

166
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:30,160
insufficient testing before uat

167
00:05:30,160 --> 00:05:31,840
leaving leading to a lot of issues being

168
00:05:31,840 --> 00:05:33,759
reported only after the system is

169
00:05:33,759 --> 00:05:34,560
deployed to

170
00:05:34,560 --> 00:05:38,000
uat so given these challenges

171
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:40,560
we see a strong need for a shift in

172
00:05:40,560 --> 00:05:42,800
software development practices

173
00:05:42,800 --> 00:05:44,800
we want to perform qa as security

174
00:05:44,800 --> 00:05:46,639
testing early and frequently during

175
00:05:46,639 --> 00:05:48,880
software development we want to shift

176
00:05:48,880 --> 00:05:51,039
left and automate testing so that we can

177
00:05:51,039 --> 00:05:53,759
get early feedback

178
00:05:53,759 --> 00:05:55,759
we want to standardize cicd toolchain

179
00:05:55,759 --> 00:05:57,919
with strong bias towards automation

180
00:05:57,919 --> 00:06:00,319
a standardized ci cd2 chain will make it

181
00:06:00,319 --> 00:06:02,400
possible to prescribe practices

182
00:06:02,400 --> 00:06:04,479
to improve visibility and also to

183
00:06:04,479 --> 00:06:07,680
provide targeted training

184
00:06:07,680 --> 00:06:09,360
we also want to take control of the

185
00:06:09,360 --> 00:06:10,960
software delivery pipeline

186
00:06:10,960 --> 00:06:12,560
okay owning the software delivery

187
00:06:12,560 --> 00:06:14,880
pipeline will make it possible to build

188
00:06:14,880 --> 00:06:15,360
in

189
00:06:15,360 --> 00:06:18,000
technical controls and also to allow

190
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:20,080
visibility into the software delivery

191
00:06:20,080 --> 00:06:22,639
pipelines

192
00:06:23,440 --> 00:06:27,440
so this uh so we strongly encourage

193
00:06:27,440 --> 00:06:30,000
the adoption of ci cd to strengthen

194
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:31,840
technical control and to improve app

195
00:06:31,840 --> 00:06:34,960
quality security and delivery velocity

196
00:06:34,960 --> 00:06:37,360
so the ci cd 2 chain will be owned by

197
00:06:37,360 --> 00:06:38,800
the government

198
00:06:38,800 --> 00:06:40,400
and hosted in an environment owned by

199
00:06:40,400 --> 00:06:42,400
the government on commercial cloud

200
00:06:42,400 --> 00:06:43,919
the project team including the

201
00:06:43,919 --> 00:06:46,240
outsourced developer will access these

202
00:06:46,240 --> 00:06:46,560
two

203
00:06:46,560 --> 00:06:48,560
chains to set up the software delivery

204
00:06:48,560 --> 00:06:50,720
pipeline and will include

205
00:06:50,720 --> 00:06:52,800
both quality and security testing in

206
00:06:52,800 --> 00:06:54,000
this pipeline

207
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:56,639
the agency project team will have access

208
00:06:56,639 --> 00:06:58,400
to this software delivery pipeline

209
00:06:58,400 --> 00:07:00,160
so they'll have early visibility of

210
00:07:00,160 --> 00:07:02,560
potential app quality or security

211
00:07:02,560 --> 00:07:06,080
issues i hope that what i shared earlier

212
00:07:06,080 --> 00:07:07,120
would have given you

213
00:07:07,120 --> 00:07:09,280
some uh better idea of what was the

214
00:07:09,280 --> 00:07:11,680
context and why we were evoking

215
00:07:11,680 --> 00:07:14,080
advocating for the adoption of ci cd

216
00:07:14,080 --> 00:07:15,759
i'll now move on to planning and

217
00:07:15,759 --> 00:07:18,479
execution

218
00:07:19,680 --> 00:07:23,280
so implementing ci cd is not the norm

219
00:07:23,280 --> 00:07:26,479
and changing norm is never easy

220
00:07:26,479 --> 00:07:29,280
especially in a bureaucratic environment

221
00:07:29,280 --> 00:07:30,800
so we have to

222
00:07:30,800 --> 00:07:33,039
encourage motivate people to want to

223
00:07:33,039 --> 00:07:35,280
adopt to implement cicd we have to show

224
00:07:35,280 --> 00:07:35,840
them

225
00:07:35,840 --> 00:07:37,840
how cicd can help to address current

226
00:07:37,840 --> 00:07:39,520
pain points and bring values

227
00:07:39,520 --> 00:07:41,199
for example we start with targeting

228
00:07:41,199 --> 00:07:42,639
those project teams who are having

229
00:07:42,639 --> 00:07:45,120
issues managing their vendors

230
00:07:45,120 --> 00:07:47,680
we also had to show how cicd can help to

231
00:07:47,680 --> 00:07:49,759
comply with existing and future policy

232
00:07:49,759 --> 00:07:50,479
and this helped

233
00:07:50,479 --> 00:07:51,919
because as mentioned earlier this is

234
00:07:51,919 --> 00:07:54,240
actually a very policies and compliance

235
00:07:54,240 --> 00:07:55,280
driven

236
00:07:55,280 --> 00:07:58,160
culture i also mentioned earlier that

237
00:07:58,160 --> 00:08:00,160
there was this push to move to

238
00:08:00,160 --> 00:08:03,280
uh to adopt agile and to move to cloud

239
00:08:03,280 --> 00:08:06,160
so one agile best practice is to adopt

240
00:08:06,160 --> 00:08:07,280
cicd

241
00:08:07,280 --> 00:08:11,039
as uh automation is key to the hr to the

242
00:08:11,039 --> 00:08:14,479
agile automation is key to achieving

243
00:08:14,479 --> 00:08:18,400
agility required from spring to spring

244
00:08:18,400 --> 00:08:21,039
um and with with cloud migration the

245
00:08:21,039 --> 00:08:23,919
agencies will anyway have to

246
00:08:23,919 --> 00:08:25,919
engage the development team to move the

247
00:08:25,919 --> 00:08:27,520
system to cloud

248
00:08:27,520 --> 00:08:29,680
so as part of the migration effort we

249
00:08:29,680 --> 00:08:32,880
encourage the agency to also adopt cicd

250
00:08:32,880 --> 00:08:35,039
so basically we piggyback on agile

251
00:08:35,039 --> 00:08:36,080
transformation

252
00:08:36,080 --> 00:08:38,399
and cloud migration to drive the crcd

253
00:08:38,399 --> 00:08:39,599
adoption

254
00:08:39,599 --> 00:08:41,919
however the key to success is actually

255
00:08:41,919 --> 00:08:43,839
showing the above to management

256
00:08:43,839 --> 00:08:45,600
and getting their support and buy-in to

257
00:08:45,600 --> 00:08:48,320
join kpi without management support in a

258
00:08:48,320 --> 00:08:49,760
bureaucratic environment

259
00:08:49,760 --> 00:08:51,519
it would have been very challenging to

260
00:08:51,519 --> 00:08:53,839
get people to pay attention to us

261
00:08:53,839 --> 00:08:55,680
obviously we also have to continue to

262
00:08:55,680 --> 00:08:57,600
update management on progress

263
00:08:57,600 --> 00:08:59,279
results and plans to keep the ball

264
00:08:59,279 --> 00:09:03,040
rolling and to maintain their support

265
00:09:04,080 --> 00:09:06,160
okay since we are pushing for the

266
00:09:06,160 --> 00:09:08,000
adoption of ci cd we also

267
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:11,120
have to identify the cicd platform and

268
00:09:11,120 --> 00:09:12,959
there are many options up there

269
00:09:12,959 --> 00:09:15,360
okay one option is to build be your own

270
00:09:15,360 --> 00:09:16,560
which brings with it

271
00:09:16,560 --> 00:09:19,120
a whole series of questions okay where

272
00:09:19,120 --> 00:09:20,240
will it be hosted

273
00:09:20,240 --> 00:09:23,120
will it be hosted on uh on premise will

274
00:09:23,120 --> 00:09:24,720
be hosted on commercial cloud or

275
00:09:24,720 --> 00:09:26,320
government commercial cloud

276
00:09:26,320 --> 00:09:27,680
what will be what would be the

277
00:09:27,680 --> 00:09:29,920
architecture be like and will it be

278
00:09:29,920 --> 00:09:32,480
compliant to policy

279
00:09:32,480 --> 00:09:34,399
who will build it will be your

280
00:09:34,399 --> 00:09:36,320
development team in-house development

281
00:09:36,320 --> 00:09:36,880
team

282
00:09:36,880 --> 00:09:38,959
uh do they have the bandwidth to do so

283
00:09:38,959 --> 00:09:40,399
will it be the same vendor that's

284
00:09:40,399 --> 00:09:42,320
developing your applications and do they

285
00:09:42,320 --> 00:09:42,959
have the com

286
00:09:42,959 --> 00:09:45,360
skill set to build such a platform or

287
00:09:45,360 --> 00:09:47,519
will he be a separate vendor

288
00:09:47,519 --> 00:09:49,600
he will be shared to reap economics of

289
00:09:49,600 --> 00:09:50,880
skill will you share

290
00:09:50,880 --> 00:09:52,640
across multiple projects in the same

291
00:09:52,640 --> 00:09:55,040
agencies will you share across multiple

292
00:09:55,040 --> 00:09:56,240
agencies

293
00:09:56,240 --> 00:09:57,920
um and if you are going to share this

294
00:09:57,920 --> 00:10:00,080
platform how do you ensure proper

295
00:10:00,080 --> 00:10:02,839
segregation between the different

296
00:10:02,839 --> 00:10:04,560
projects

297
00:10:04,560 --> 00:10:06,480
after you have set up the platform you

298
00:10:06,480 --> 00:10:07,680
will still have to

299
00:10:07,680 --> 00:10:10,560
patch update maintain the platform as

300
00:10:10,560 --> 00:10:11,360
well as to

301
00:10:11,360 --> 00:10:13,839
troubleshoot any issues that is reported

302
00:10:13,839 --> 00:10:15,680
so who will actually do this piece of

303
00:10:15,680 --> 00:10:16,880
work

304
00:10:16,880 --> 00:10:19,360
and how much will it cost there is the

305
00:10:19,360 --> 00:10:20,320
set out cost

306
00:10:20,320 --> 00:10:22,160
there can also be professional services

307
00:10:22,160 --> 00:10:23,360
costs the

308
00:10:23,360 --> 00:10:25,200
uh licensing costs if you are using

309
00:10:25,200 --> 00:10:27,440
proprietary software or tooling

310
00:10:27,440 --> 00:10:29,680
uh the hosting cost as well as the

311
00:10:29,680 --> 00:10:32,880
maintenance costs one very popular

312
00:10:32,880 --> 00:10:34,160
option is to use

313
00:10:34,160 --> 00:10:36,800
managed service so in the context of

314
00:10:36,800 --> 00:10:38,079
singapore government one question that

315
00:10:38,079 --> 00:10:39,040
we have to ask is that

316
00:10:39,040 --> 00:10:41,279
are they available in singapore

317
00:10:41,279 --> 00:10:43,519
depending on the system classification

318
00:10:43,519 --> 00:10:45,839
the data may be required to be hosted in

319
00:10:45,839 --> 00:10:46,640
singapore

320
00:10:46,640 --> 00:10:48,800
so one very popular managed service is

321
00:10:48,800 --> 00:10:50,079
azure devops

322
00:10:50,079 --> 00:10:53,120
so azure devops is a global service

323
00:10:53,120 --> 00:10:55,360
unfortunately they do not have the

324
00:10:55,360 --> 00:10:57,760
option to host the data in singapore

325
00:10:57,760 --> 00:11:00,560
so which makes it not not a possible

326
00:11:00,560 --> 00:11:03,360
option for certain system classification

327
00:11:03,360 --> 00:11:06,000
okay what do they provide cloud service

328
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:07,120
providers such as

329
00:11:07,120 --> 00:11:10,320
azure google cloud aws do provide source

330
00:11:10,320 --> 00:11:12,160
code repositories

331
00:11:12,160 --> 00:11:14,800
pipeline orchestrator build agents and

332
00:11:14,800 --> 00:11:16,880
deployment orchestrator

333
00:11:16,880 --> 00:11:19,120
the security testing services are

334
00:11:19,120 --> 00:11:21,279
usually provided out of the

335
00:11:21,279 --> 00:11:23,519
marketplace and these services may

336
00:11:23,519 --> 00:11:25,519
actually not be hosted in singapore okay

337
00:11:25,519 --> 00:11:27,040
which boils back to the first question i

338
00:11:27,040 --> 00:11:28,640
think available in singapore

339
00:11:28,640 --> 00:11:31,120
and how will they be assessed okay can

340
00:11:31,120 --> 00:11:32,640
this platform be assessed by

341
00:11:32,640 --> 00:11:35,040
both the government officials who are

342
00:11:35,040 --> 00:11:37,040
using their government issues station

343
00:11:37,040 --> 00:11:40,800
as well as the suppliers and contractors

344
00:11:40,800 --> 00:11:42,720
who are using internet accessible laptop

345
00:11:42,720 --> 00:11:44,160
but without access to the government

346
00:11:44,160 --> 00:11:46,880
enterprise network

347
00:11:46,880 --> 00:11:49,279
so one option that's available to the

348
00:11:49,279 --> 00:11:50,880
singapore government agency is the

349
00:11:50,880 --> 00:11:51,839
singapore

350
00:11:51,839 --> 00:11:55,600
government text okay the singapore

351
00:11:55,600 --> 00:11:56,000
government

352
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:57,680
tech stack is a government-owned

353
00:11:57,680 --> 00:11:59,680
platform to provide a set of reusable

354
00:11:59,680 --> 00:12:00,880
components to streamline

355
00:12:00,880 --> 00:12:03,360
application development this is to lower

356
00:12:03,360 --> 00:12:05,519
cost of development of digital services

357
00:12:05,519 --> 00:12:05,920
through

358
00:12:05,920 --> 00:12:08,160
centrally handled common services with

359
00:12:08,160 --> 00:12:09,760
better economies of skill and reduce

360
00:12:09,760 --> 00:12:11,200
duplication

361
00:12:11,200 --> 00:12:12,560
technical requirements are also

362
00:12:12,560 --> 00:12:14,800
beginning to provide baseline compliance

363
00:12:14,800 --> 00:12:17,360
to improve quality and security

364
00:12:17,360 --> 00:12:18,959
such a platform will also reduce the

365
00:12:18,959 --> 00:12:20,720
need for agencies to set up

366
00:12:20,720 --> 00:12:23,200
extensive digital infrastructure thereby

367
00:12:23,200 --> 00:12:25,279
improving speed and productivity

368
00:12:25,279 --> 00:12:27,839
as you may have already noticed uh part

369
00:12:27,839 --> 00:12:28,880
of the test set

370
00:12:28,880 --> 00:12:33,760
includes a two chain that enables cicd

371
00:12:33,760 --> 00:12:36,480
so these two chain this centralized csd

372
00:12:36,480 --> 00:12:38,240
platform is actually code named

373
00:12:38,240 --> 00:12:41,079
ship hex okay so shipment hex is a

374
00:12:41,079 --> 00:12:42,720
multi-talented software

375
00:12:42,720 --> 00:12:44,560
as a service hosted on government

376
00:12:44,560 --> 00:12:45,839
commercial cloud

377
00:12:45,839 --> 00:12:47,839
the tools have already been set up and

378
00:12:47,839 --> 00:12:50,480
maintained by a central gov that team

379
00:12:50,480 --> 00:12:52,639
the agencies simply have to subscribe

380
00:12:52,639 --> 00:12:54,320
and use the tools they do not have to

381
00:12:54,320 --> 00:12:56,320
set up similar tools back in their own

382
00:12:56,320 --> 00:12:58,880
environment so this platform comes with

383
00:12:58,880 --> 00:13:00,720
many different type of tools

384
00:13:00,720 --> 00:13:02,720
uh there is a source code repository

385
00:13:02,720 --> 00:13:03,920
which is big bucket

386
00:13:03,920 --> 00:13:05,920
this comes with a plugin to scan for

387
00:13:05,920 --> 00:13:07,839
hard coded secret

388
00:13:07,839 --> 00:13:09,600
for orchestrators we have bamboo and

389
00:13:09,600 --> 00:13:11,680
xebialab they also come with

390
00:13:11,680 --> 00:13:14,000
agents that you can use to execute

391
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:16,079
pipeline tasks

392
00:13:16,079 --> 00:13:18,320
for static costing we have 45 sonarqube

393
00:13:18,320 --> 00:13:19,920
to analyze the source code for

394
00:13:19,920 --> 00:13:21,440
vulnerabilities and code smell

395
00:13:21,440 --> 00:13:23,200
so fortify more for security

396
00:13:23,200 --> 00:13:25,360
vulnerabilities sonarqube more for code

397
00:13:25,360 --> 00:13:26,320
smell

398
00:13:26,320 --> 00:13:28,480
for software composition analysis there

399
00:13:28,480 --> 00:13:29,920
is nexus iq

400
00:13:29,920 --> 00:13:32,240
which is used to identify vulnerable

401
00:13:32,240 --> 00:13:34,480
open source libraries

402
00:13:34,480 --> 00:13:36,880
nasa's iq is also used to track build of

403
00:13:36,880 --> 00:13:37,839
material

404
00:13:37,839 --> 00:13:40,560
and also to continuously monitor for new

405
00:13:40,560 --> 00:13:42,880
vulnerabilities being reported for

406
00:13:42,880 --> 00:13:44,560
existing open source library use in the

407
00:13:44,560 --> 00:13:46,560
production environment

408
00:13:46,560 --> 00:13:49,040
for dynamic application security testing

409
00:13:49,040 --> 00:13:51,279
we have 45 react inspect which can be

410
00:13:51,279 --> 00:13:53,120
used to scan the web application for

411
00:13:53,120 --> 00:13:55,199
security vulnerabilities

412
00:13:55,199 --> 00:13:57,440
for automated testing in particular we

413
00:13:57,440 --> 00:13:59,839
have a dedicated mobile device fund

414
00:13:59,839 --> 00:14:01,360
which is hosted in singapore for

415
00:14:01,360 --> 00:14:03,760
government use

416
00:14:03,760 --> 00:14:05,440
for container image scanning we have two

417
00:14:05,440 --> 00:14:06,800
slot which can be used to scan the

418
00:14:06,800 --> 00:14:07,519
container

419
00:14:07,519 --> 00:14:09,440
images for potential security

420
00:14:09,440 --> 00:14:10,560
vulnerabilities

421
00:14:10,560 --> 00:14:14,079
and possible violation of best practices

422
00:14:14,079 --> 00:14:16,079
for artifact repository we have nexus

423
00:14:16,079 --> 00:14:18,240
repository which can be used to host

424
00:14:18,240 --> 00:14:20,079
artifact as well as proprietary

425
00:14:20,079 --> 00:14:21,279
libraries

426
00:14:21,279 --> 00:14:23,440
for documentation we have confluence

427
00:14:23,440 --> 00:14:25,040
which is a wiki based tool

428
00:14:25,040 --> 00:14:26,959
and we also have jira software to manage

429
00:14:26,959 --> 00:14:28,839
the projects and

430
00:14:28,839 --> 00:14:31,440
tickets so setting our platform

431
00:14:31,440 --> 00:14:35,600
it's not just about um hosting and

432
00:14:35,600 --> 00:14:38,560
running the tools we have a very close

433
00:14:38,560 --> 00:14:40,560
relationship with the platform team

434
00:14:40,560 --> 00:14:42,560
and we work with them closely to meet

435
00:14:42,560 --> 00:14:44,639
the services demand as the

436
00:14:44,639 --> 00:14:47,120
agency demands and requirements for

437
00:14:47,120 --> 00:14:48,000
example

438
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:50,240
ensuring that the platform can meet the

439
00:14:50,240 --> 00:14:51,839
upcoming new load

440
00:14:51,839 --> 00:14:54,880
uh ensuring that the new projects can

441
00:14:54,880 --> 00:14:58,000
seamlessly onboard the platform

442
00:14:58,000 --> 00:14:59,360
making sure that the platform can

443
00:14:59,360 --> 00:15:01,040
support both outsourced and

444
00:15:01,040 --> 00:15:03,839
in-house teams and also making sure that

445
00:15:03,839 --> 00:15:05,600
the roles provided on the platform can

446
00:15:05,600 --> 00:15:07,760
map back to the roles and responsibility

447
00:15:07,760 --> 00:15:08,000
of

448
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:12,399
a typical project team

449
00:15:12,399 --> 00:15:16,240
so as cicd um was not the non-bad dam

450
00:15:16,240 --> 00:15:18,720
there's definitely knowledge gap we had

451
00:15:18,720 --> 00:15:21,440
to identify the different stakeholders

452
00:15:21,440 --> 00:15:23,279
understand their knowledge our general

453
00:15:23,279 --> 00:15:25,040
concerns and level understanding

454
00:15:25,040 --> 00:15:26,880
and applying different strategies to

455
00:15:26,880 --> 00:15:29,199
close knowledge gaps and secure buy-in

456
00:15:29,199 --> 00:15:30,800
our stakeholders include different

457
00:15:30,800 --> 00:15:33,120
parties from cios to in-house and

458
00:15:33,120 --> 00:15:34,880
outsource developers

459
00:15:34,880 --> 00:15:36,800
we also make use of different media

460
00:15:36,800 --> 00:15:39,920
mediums we have websites to channel uh

461
00:15:39,920 --> 00:15:41,600
to provide general knowledge and

462
00:15:41,600 --> 00:15:42,959
documentation

463
00:15:42,959 --> 00:15:46,000
we have briefings to help prepare the

464
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:47,680
uh agency project teams and their

465
00:15:47,680 --> 00:15:49,279
vendors and contractors

466
00:15:49,279 --> 00:15:51,759
for onboarding the platform we also have

467
00:15:51,759 --> 00:15:52,880
hands-on training

468
00:15:52,880 --> 00:15:56,079
to help to deepen knowledge what we

469
00:15:56,079 --> 00:15:56,480
found

470
00:15:56,480 --> 00:15:58,720
critical is building intimate

471
00:15:58,720 --> 00:16:00,240
understanding of the ground

472
00:16:00,240 --> 00:16:01,519
through having team members who are

473
00:16:01,519 --> 00:16:03,120
deployed to agencies or have worked as

474
00:16:03,120 --> 00:16:04,480
vendors before

475
00:16:04,480 --> 00:16:06,240
and getting hands dirty by working

476
00:16:06,240 --> 00:16:08,240
directly with the different stakeholders

477
00:16:08,240 --> 00:16:11,519
to adopt and implement citcd

478
00:16:11,519 --> 00:16:14,880
we have found this uh very critical in

479
00:16:14,880 --> 00:16:17,680
helping us identify the different

480
00:16:17,680 --> 00:16:18,720
stakeholders

481
00:16:18,720 --> 00:16:21,279
understanding where the gaps are and

482
00:16:21,279 --> 00:16:23,040
also how to channel the required

483
00:16:23,040 --> 00:16:24,800
information to the project team

484
00:16:24,800 --> 00:16:26,880
so that they they can adopt and

485
00:16:26,880 --> 00:16:30,639
implement ci cd accordingly

486
00:16:31,519 --> 00:16:33,440
so this is example of closing knowledge

487
00:16:33,440 --> 00:16:36,000
get for the agency project manager

488
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:38,720
and business analyst so some common

489
00:16:38,720 --> 00:16:40,720
questions that they have raised include

490
00:16:40,720 --> 00:16:42,639
like what is cicd

491
00:16:42,639 --> 00:16:45,519
how much do i need to budget for how do

492
00:16:45,519 --> 00:16:47,279
i onboard shipment heads

493
00:16:47,279 --> 00:16:49,360
so to address such knowledge get we have

494
00:16:49,360 --> 00:16:51,680
an intranet website providing cicd

495
00:16:51,680 --> 00:16:53,040
related information

496
00:16:53,040 --> 00:16:54,880
for different project stages from

497
00:16:54,880 --> 00:16:56,240
project initiation

498
00:16:56,240 --> 00:16:58,480
budget estimation funding approval

499
00:16:58,480 --> 00:17:00,320
preparing tender onboarding shipment

500
00:17:00,320 --> 00:17:03,199
heads to implementing crcd

501
00:17:03,199 --> 00:17:06,079
as most of these systems are outsourced

502
00:17:06,079 --> 00:17:08,240
the agency project team often have to

503
00:17:08,240 --> 00:17:09,760
work with their suppliers and

504
00:17:09,760 --> 00:17:10,720
contractors

505
00:17:10,720 --> 00:17:13,679
to implement ci cd for their systems and

506
00:17:13,679 --> 00:17:15,679
these suppliers and contractors may not

507
00:17:15,679 --> 00:17:18,079
have access to the intranet website so

508
00:17:18,079 --> 00:17:20,400
we also provide a public website

509
00:17:20,400 --> 00:17:22,079
that has information about ship and

510
00:17:22,079 --> 00:17:23,919
tests its subscription model

511
00:17:23,919 --> 00:17:27,280
tools and roadmap we also have separate

512
00:17:27,280 --> 00:17:29,039
regular onboarding briefing

513
00:17:29,039 --> 00:17:31,440
for pmb and their vendors so that they

514
00:17:31,440 --> 00:17:33,440
can so they have they can gain some

515
00:17:33,440 --> 00:17:35,200
basic knowledge of ship and heads where

516
00:17:35,200 --> 00:17:37,120
to find the required information

517
00:17:37,120 --> 00:17:38,799
and how to prepare for onboarding the

518
00:17:38,799 --> 00:17:40,480
platform uh

519
00:17:40,480 --> 00:17:42,480
for trains they are created hands-on

520
00:17:42,480 --> 00:17:43,600
foundation training

521
00:17:43,600 --> 00:17:45,360
that is specific to the ship and hex

522
00:17:45,360 --> 00:17:47,520
platform and also has government

523
00:17:47,520 --> 00:17:48,400
contacts

524
00:17:48,400 --> 00:17:50,799
this is to ensure that the trainees will

525
00:17:50,799 --> 00:17:52,400
gain the relevant knowledge from the

526
00:17:52,400 --> 00:17:53,039
training

527
00:17:53,039 --> 00:17:55,440
and to be able to apply the knowledge

528
00:17:55,440 --> 00:17:56,320
directly

529
00:17:56,320 --> 00:18:01,760
in their in their project

530
00:18:01,760 --> 00:18:03,919
okay so as ship and heads is a

531
00:18:03,919 --> 00:18:05,760
standardized and centralized

532
00:18:05,760 --> 00:18:08,640
ci cd platform it makes it possible to

533
00:18:08,640 --> 00:18:09,280
develop

534
00:18:09,280 --> 00:18:12,240
reusable templates and modules so these

535
00:18:12,240 --> 00:18:14,559
reusable templates and modules

536
00:18:14,559 --> 00:18:17,280
have helped to reduce duplication and

537
00:18:17,280 --> 00:18:17,840
cost

538
00:18:17,840 --> 00:18:20,960
they also help to reduce the uh uh you

539
00:18:20,960 --> 00:18:23,520
also have to improve the speed of

540
00:18:23,520 --> 00:18:24,960
adopting and implementing

541
00:18:24,960 --> 00:18:28,320
ci cd uh what we have also seen is that

542
00:18:28,320 --> 00:18:29,840
you also have to reduce the fee of the

543
00:18:29,840 --> 00:18:30,640
unknown

544
00:18:30,640 --> 00:18:33,280
to provide some assurance and to show

545
00:18:33,280 --> 00:18:34,880
that it can be done

546
00:18:34,880 --> 00:18:37,039
so to help the project team to implement

547
00:18:37,039 --> 00:18:39,600
ci cd pipelines on ship enhanced

548
00:18:39,600 --> 00:18:42,640
we have provided pipeline templates test

549
00:18:42,640 --> 00:18:44,240
automation for everyone starter kit

550
00:18:44,240 --> 00:18:46,400
as well as reusable strips to perform ci

551
00:18:46,400 --> 00:18:48,000
cd tasks

552
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:50,000
to help the project team to prepare for

553
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:51,600
on-boarding ship and heads

554
00:18:51,600 --> 00:18:53,840
we also have templates to help them to

555
00:18:53,840 --> 00:18:56,160
get the required funding

556
00:18:56,160 --> 00:18:58,720
to implement ci cd for their system and

557
00:18:58,720 --> 00:19:00,880
also to require the vendor

558
00:19:00,880 --> 00:19:05,360
to implement cicd as per contract terms

559
00:19:05,360 --> 00:19:07,840
so we have to prioritize by identifying

560
00:19:07,840 --> 00:19:09,520
the most common use case

561
00:19:09,520 --> 00:19:11,360
and building in the required control and

562
00:19:11,360 --> 00:19:13,120
best practices into the reusable

563
00:19:13,120 --> 00:19:14,640
templates and modules

564
00:19:14,640 --> 00:19:16,480
okay what we have observed is that if

565
00:19:16,480 --> 00:19:17,760
templates were

566
00:19:17,760 --> 00:19:20,400
used the likelihood of continuing with

567
00:19:20,400 --> 00:19:22,720
the best practice with the back-end best

568
00:19:22,720 --> 00:19:26,640
practices is actually very high

569
00:19:27,280 --> 00:19:29,600
so this is the adoption status as of

570
00:19:29,600 --> 00:19:31,919
march 2021

571
00:19:31,919 --> 00:19:34,720
we have had 28 agencies with at least

572
00:19:34,720 --> 00:19:36,880
one system using ship and has

573
00:19:36,880 --> 00:19:39,919
and in total we have 126 22 systems that

574
00:19:39,919 --> 00:19:41,919
are using a platform

575
00:19:41,919 --> 00:19:44,400
so far we have 43 agencies with at least

576
00:19:44,400 --> 00:19:45,919
one staff that has undergone the

577
00:19:45,919 --> 00:19:46,720
training

578
00:19:46,720 --> 00:19:49,919
and 365 in total who have been trained

579
00:19:49,919 --> 00:19:53,520
in cicd

580
00:19:53,520 --> 00:19:55,679
he nominated me move on to challenges

581
00:19:55,679 --> 00:19:58,320
and next step

582
00:19:58,320 --> 00:20:01,600
okay so to recap ship and hex is a

583
00:20:01,600 --> 00:20:03,360
multi-tenanted software

584
00:20:03,360 --> 00:20:06,320
as a service hosted in cloud as a result

585
00:20:06,320 --> 00:20:06,799
of this

586
00:20:06,799 --> 00:20:10,000
operating model there are limitations

587
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:12,720
okay so for example ship to access

588
00:20:12,720 --> 00:20:13,440
shipment heads

589
00:20:13,440 --> 00:20:16,720
you require internet connectivity so

590
00:20:16,720 --> 00:20:18,480
it cannot be accessed from the

591
00:20:18,480 --> 00:20:20,960
government enterprise network

592
00:20:20,960 --> 00:20:23,280
due to classification reason it also

593
00:20:23,280 --> 00:20:24,960
cannot be used for on-premises

594
00:20:24,960 --> 00:20:28,000
so it can only be used for cloud systems

595
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:29,760
uh while shipment heads is a

596
00:20:29,760 --> 00:20:31,440
prescriptive model

597
00:20:31,440 --> 00:20:34,000
where the tools are specifically created

598
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:35,840
to be included in the platform

599
00:20:35,840 --> 00:20:38,320
there are limited choices for each tool

600
00:20:38,320 --> 00:20:39,600
type

601
00:20:39,600 --> 00:20:43,200
so this can make it difficult to find

602
00:20:43,200 --> 00:20:45,120
resources who are skilled in the

603
00:20:45,120 --> 00:20:46,320
specific tools

604
00:20:46,320 --> 00:20:48,720
especially if these tools are not widely

605
00:20:48,720 --> 00:20:50,000
available

606
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:52,799
and it can also be less appealing to

607
00:20:52,799 --> 00:20:54,159
developers

608
00:20:54,159 --> 00:20:55,760
if the developers have preference of

609
00:20:55,760 --> 00:20:58,559
what tools that they want to use

610
00:20:58,559 --> 00:21:02,080
to give an example based on feedback uh

611
00:21:02,080 --> 00:21:04,640
bamboo is a not a very popular tool

612
00:21:04,640 --> 00:21:05,120
among the

613
00:21:05,120 --> 00:21:06,960
amount of developers who receive quite a

614
00:21:06,960 --> 00:21:08,640
lot of complaints about it

615
00:21:08,640 --> 00:21:11,760
okay there are also concentration risk

616
00:21:11,760 --> 00:21:14,880
um as this is a multi-tenanted

617
00:21:14,880 --> 00:21:17,679
model if the platform goes down all the

618
00:21:17,679 --> 00:21:20,080
subscribers will be affected

619
00:21:20,080 --> 00:21:23,039
there can also be access control related

620
00:21:23,039 --> 00:21:23,520
kind of

621
00:21:23,520 --> 00:21:26,559
issues where one subscriber can

622
00:21:26,559 --> 00:21:29,039
intentionally or unintentionally access

623
00:21:29,039 --> 00:21:32,879
the data of another subscriber

624
00:21:33,520 --> 00:21:36,080
so another challenge that we observe is

625
00:21:36,080 --> 00:21:37,520
that as the number of tools

626
00:21:37,520 --> 00:21:39,679
increase there is also a higher chance

627
00:21:39,679 --> 00:21:41,440
of misconfiguration

628
00:21:41,440 --> 00:21:44,240
as of now there are already at least 14

629
00:21:44,240 --> 00:21:45,039
tools

630
00:21:45,039 --> 00:21:47,280
and more to be added as the platform

631
00:21:47,280 --> 00:21:48,159
evolve

632
00:21:48,159 --> 00:21:50,880
and configuration can include many types

633
00:21:50,880 --> 00:21:52,000
such as permissions

634
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:54,799
policies features scan rules and quality

635
00:21:54,799 --> 00:21:55,679
game

636
00:21:55,679 --> 00:21:57,600
so some common misconfiguration that

637
00:21:57,600 --> 00:21:58,799
we've seen so far

638
00:21:58,799 --> 00:22:00,559
include for example project and

639
00:22:00,559 --> 00:22:02,159
repository being

640
00:22:02,159 --> 00:22:05,600
unintentionally public user account

641
00:22:05,600 --> 00:22:07,440
being given too many permissions so not

642
00:22:07,440 --> 00:22:08,880
following the principle or this

643
00:22:08,880 --> 00:22:09,840
privilege

644
00:22:09,840 --> 00:22:12,000
our lacks of disabled policies are used

645
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:15,039
in the security testing tools

646
00:22:15,039 --> 00:22:18,480
so with with so many tools it can become

647
00:22:18,480 --> 00:22:20,559
difficult to track and to manage the

648
00:22:20,559 --> 00:22:23,039
configuration for every single tool

649
00:22:23,039 --> 00:22:25,600
especially as the number of projects

650
00:22:25,600 --> 00:22:26,320
that

651
00:22:26,320 --> 00:22:30,080
a person have to manage increase

652
00:22:31,440 --> 00:22:34,000
one other challenge that we observe is

653
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:36,240
knowing what or how to monitor and to

654
00:22:36,240 --> 00:22:37,360
measure quality

655
00:22:37,360 --> 00:22:40,080
security and delivery okay there are

656
00:22:40,080 --> 00:22:41,360
many tools here

657
00:22:41,360 --> 00:22:44,320
and each two provide lots of information

658
00:22:44,320 --> 00:22:46,080
some of this information can be created

659
00:22:46,080 --> 00:22:47,200
via api

660
00:22:47,200 --> 00:22:49,120
while some of the information are locked

661
00:22:49,120 --> 00:22:52,400
within the two specific data store

662
00:22:52,400 --> 00:22:56,080
it can be difficult to collect

663
00:22:56,080 --> 00:22:58,559
data from the various tools and then to

664
00:22:58,559 --> 00:22:59,760
make sense of the data

665
00:22:59,760 --> 00:23:02,720
in order to meet decision so as a result

666
00:23:02,720 --> 00:23:03,600
of this challenge

667
00:23:03,600 --> 00:23:06,880
it is common to not measure or monitor

668
00:23:06,880 --> 00:23:08,480
until required such as when you need to

669
00:23:08,480 --> 00:23:10,480
report to management

670
00:23:10,480 --> 00:23:12,799
or to manually collate the metrics which

671
00:23:12,799 --> 00:23:14,559
can be effect intensive

672
00:23:14,559 --> 00:23:17,600
and error prone and to not use the

673
00:23:17,600 --> 00:23:19,679
metrics to improve delivery efficiency

674
00:23:19,679 --> 00:23:21,280
and effectiveness

675
00:23:21,280 --> 00:23:23,520
and because measuring and monitoring are

676
00:23:23,520 --> 00:23:24,640
not in mind

677
00:23:24,640 --> 00:23:26,640
the resources that are created are not

678
00:23:26,640 --> 00:23:29,039
organized in a consistent manner

679
00:23:29,039 --> 00:23:31,039
they make it easier to correlate

680
00:23:31,039 --> 00:23:36,559
sanitize and analyze the data

681
00:23:36,559 --> 00:23:39,200
okay so we have been very focused on

682
00:23:39,200 --> 00:23:41,600
getting the agency to start adopting ci

683
00:23:41,600 --> 00:23:42,559
cd

684
00:23:42,559 --> 00:23:44,960
we want to go beyond by adding

685
00:23:44,960 --> 00:23:47,360
visibility to the software delivery

686
00:23:47,360 --> 00:23:50,640
pipelines and enabling the project teams

687
00:23:50,640 --> 00:23:53,360
to be able to make use of the data that

688
00:23:53,360 --> 00:23:54,000
they have

689
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:57,039
to make decisions

690
00:23:57,039 --> 00:23:58,960
so as i quote from the state of software

691
00:23:58,960 --> 00:24:01,760
delivery management report 2020

692
00:24:01,760 --> 00:24:04,159
software delivery is not a data driven

693
00:24:04,159 --> 00:24:05,120
activity

694
00:24:05,120 --> 00:24:07,200
and data needed by software practitioner

695
00:24:07,200 --> 00:24:08,799
by the leadership executive should be

696
00:24:08,799 --> 00:24:10,720
accurate and freely accessible to allow

697
00:24:10,720 --> 00:24:11,679
them to

698
00:24:11,679 --> 00:24:13,919
to more easily do their jobs and make

699
00:24:13,919 --> 00:24:16,320
data-driven decisions

700
00:24:16,320 --> 00:24:18,320
okay so this has also helped to drive us

701
00:24:18,320 --> 00:24:20,559
on what we wanted to go do going ahead

702
00:24:20,559 --> 00:24:22,799
so for the year here we are looking at

703
00:24:22,799 --> 00:24:24,480
organizing and providing more

704
00:24:24,480 --> 00:24:26,640
documentation and training to accelerate

705
00:24:26,640 --> 00:24:29,039
uplifting of different stakeholders uh

706
00:24:29,039 --> 00:24:30,960
we are working with it vendors

707
00:24:30,960 --> 00:24:33,440
to upskill relevant competencies and

708
00:24:33,440 --> 00:24:34,159
improve

709
00:24:34,159 --> 00:24:37,440
uh implementation time uh as mentioned

710
00:24:37,440 --> 00:24:39,039
earlier as of now

711
00:24:39,039 --> 00:24:41,039
uh the platform does not support

712
00:24:41,039 --> 00:24:43,200
on-premise systems so we are looking at

713
00:24:43,200 --> 00:24:45,360
how we can enable on-premise system

714
00:24:45,360 --> 00:24:48,960
adopt ci cd we also want to enable the

715
00:24:48,960 --> 00:24:51,559
project team to identify potential tools

716
00:24:51,559 --> 00:24:53,600
misconfiguration through the use of

717
00:24:53,600 --> 00:24:55,279
script or tool

718
00:24:55,279 --> 00:24:57,360
and we want to enable the agencies to

719
00:24:57,360 --> 00:24:58,480
monitor and measure

720
00:24:58,480 --> 00:25:01,039
application quality security and

721
00:25:01,039 --> 00:25:02,720
delivery

722
00:25:02,720 --> 00:25:05,200
by providing them with a means to

723
00:25:05,200 --> 00:25:05,919
collate

724
00:25:05,919 --> 00:25:09,200
sanitize analyze and present the data

725
00:25:09,200 --> 00:25:13,200
so um so to

726
00:25:13,200 --> 00:25:15,760
so so the the the steps that we are

727
00:25:15,760 --> 00:25:17,200
talking about here are only

728
00:25:17,200 --> 00:25:19,440
made possible because ship and hex is a

729
00:25:19,440 --> 00:25:22,000
centralized and standardized platform

730
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:24,000
so the goal over here is to increase

731
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:26,480
coverage and to provide visibility into

732
00:25:26,480 --> 00:25:30,159
the software delivery pipelines

733
00:25:30,559 --> 00:25:32,240
for further reference you can take a

734
00:25:32,240 --> 00:25:33,520
look at some of the links that are

735
00:25:33,520 --> 00:25:36,400
provided here

736
00:25:37,200 --> 00:25:39,200
so this comes to the end of my talk

737
00:25:39,200 --> 00:25:42,400
thank you so much again for listening in

738
00:25:42,400 --> 00:25:50,320
and have a good day
