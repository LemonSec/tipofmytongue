also known as she hacks purple um and

37
00:01:26,720 --> 00:01:29,840
i'm not wearing purple today

38
00:01:30,079 --> 00:01:32,240
and basically i'm a nerd who's really

39
00:01:32,240 --> 00:01:34,240
obsessed with the security of software

40
00:01:34,240 --> 00:01:36,400
and so recently like a year and a half

41
00:01:36,400 --> 00:01:38,560
ago i started my own company and we give

42
00:01:38,560 --> 00:01:41,360
training on how to do that and the

43
00:01:41,360 --> 00:01:42,960
company is we hack purple as well right

44
00:01:42,960 --> 00:01:45,119
and yes and the companies we hack purple

45
00:01:45,119 --> 00:01:46,720
i'm getting the hang of this whole self

46
00:01:46,720 --> 00:01:48,399
introduction

47
00:01:48,399 --> 00:01:50,720
and so why purple tanya why what's team

48
00:01:50,720 --> 00:01:51,920
purple

49
00:01:51,920 --> 00:01:54,079
oh so i was at dev and then i switched

50
00:01:54,079 --> 00:01:56,320
to security and i was a pen tester but

51
00:01:56,320 --> 00:01:58,560
then i kept doing defense things and it

52
00:01:58,560 --> 00:02:00,320
turned out i couldn't make up my mind

53
00:02:00,320 --> 00:02:02,960
and it turns out attacking his red team

54
00:02:02,960 --> 00:02:04,880
and it turns out defending his blue team

55
00:02:04,880 --> 00:02:06,719
and someone said oh your purple team

56
00:02:06,719 --> 00:02:08,560
isn't that what abstech people do where

57
00:02:08,560 --> 00:02:10,639
you kind of have to wear both hats and

58
00:02:10,639 --> 00:02:14,160
before i knew it um i had purple hair

59
00:02:14,160 --> 00:02:17,440
it's not pre-requisite of absect though

60
00:02:17,440 --> 00:02:19,280
so yeah if you want to apply to we have

61
00:02:19,280 --> 00:02:20,840
purple you have to have purple hair i

62
00:02:20,840 --> 00:02:23,840
presume

63
00:02:25,440 --> 00:02:27,040
matt tell us a little bit a little bit

64
00:02:27,040 --> 00:02:28,560
about yourself yeah hi

65
00:02:28,560 --> 00:02:31,200
folks um i'm matt jarvis i'm a senior

66
00:02:31,200 --> 00:02:32,959
developer advocate at snake

67
00:02:32,959 --> 00:02:36,400
um so i spend most of my time

68
00:02:36,400 --> 00:02:39,519
uh out talking to to uh developers and

69
00:02:39,519 --> 00:02:40,400
other folks

70
00:02:40,400 --> 00:02:43,440
about uh security and and really about

71
00:02:43,440 --> 00:02:45,599
cloud native security in the uh in the

72
00:02:45,599 --> 00:02:46,959
most part um

73
00:02:46,959 --> 00:02:48,879
i i guess i've worn many hats in my

74
00:02:48,879 --> 00:02:50,000
career but

75
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:51,840
i've mainly been building stuff with

76
00:02:51,840 --> 00:02:53,280
open source software for a very long

77
00:02:53,280 --> 00:02:54,319
time so

78
00:02:54,319 --> 00:02:56,959
um i've been in big organizations like

79
00:02:56,959 --> 00:02:57,840
ibm and r

80
00:02:57,840 --> 00:03:01,200
d um i've been a cto

81
00:03:01,200 --> 00:03:04,319
i've been a developer assist admin i've

82
00:03:04,319 --> 00:03:06,640
kind of worn all the hats really so uh

83
00:03:06,640 --> 00:03:08,400
long and varied as you can probably tell

84
00:03:08,400 --> 00:03:10,480
from the grey hair

85
00:03:10,480 --> 00:03:12,159
well the hats cover it well so that's

86
00:03:12,159 --> 00:03:13,680
that's all good that's all good

87
00:03:13,680 --> 00:03:15,840
wonderful and my name's simon maple and

88
00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:16,879
i'll be your

89
00:03:16,879 --> 00:03:19,360
your host and moderator for today so why

90
00:03:19,360 --> 00:03:20,720
don't we jump straight in and i'll give

91
00:03:20,720 --> 00:03:22,239
a very brief introduction in terms of

92
00:03:22,239 --> 00:03:23,040
what are the uh

93
00:03:23,040 --> 00:03:24,720
areas that we're going to be um focusing

94
00:03:24,720 --> 00:03:26,799
on um when we talk about successful

95
00:03:26,799 --> 00:03:28,879
rollout of uh security programs we're

96
00:03:28,879 --> 00:03:29,519
going to be

97
00:03:29,519 --> 00:03:31,440
talking a little bit about two aspects

98
00:03:31,440 --> 00:03:32,879
of that one is

99
00:03:32,879 --> 00:03:34,799
the depth of rollout and one is the

100
00:03:34,799 --> 00:03:36,000
breadth of a roll out so we're going to

101
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:37,920
be talking about an individual team

102
00:03:37,920 --> 00:03:41,040
how to roll out a security program to

103
00:03:41,040 --> 00:03:42,560
that team so you wouldn't go all

104
00:03:42,560 --> 00:03:45,040
in and expect everyone in the team to be

105
00:03:45,040 --> 00:03:46,000
expert straight away

106
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:48,400
so how do you bit by bit um roll that

107
00:03:48,400 --> 00:03:50,239
out throughout a single team

108
00:03:50,239 --> 00:03:51,920
and then the second one the breadth so

109
00:03:51,920 --> 00:03:53,360
once you've um

110
00:03:53,360 --> 00:03:55,680
succeeded or been successful with with a

111
00:03:55,680 --> 00:03:56,959
team or a number of teams

112
00:03:56,959 --> 00:03:59,599
how do you then roll that out across to

113
00:03:59,599 --> 00:04:00,000
across

114
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:01,599
the organization and actually have

115
00:04:01,599 --> 00:04:04,239
coverage across that um

116
00:04:04,239 --> 00:04:07,200
so let's start with depth and i'll open

117
00:04:07,200 --> 00:04:09,200
uh i'll open up first of all um to

118
00:04:09,200 --> 00:04:12,799
wendy and ask um how

119
00:04:12,799 --> 00:04:14,159
should we when we when we're talking

120
00:04:14,159 --> 00:04:15,840
about um depth

121
00:04:15,840 --> 00:04:18,560
uh how do you go about picking the first

122
00:04:18,560 --> 00:04:19,120
teams

123
00:04:19,120 --> 00:04:22,400
that you want to roll um a program out

124
00:04:22,400 --> 00:04:23,120
to

125
00:04:23,120 --> 00:04:25,919
and how many teams is the right number

126
00:04:25,919 --> 00:04:28,320
if there is a right number oh that

127
00:04:28,320 --> 00:04:30,000
that's such a tough question

128
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:33,040
um picking the team

129
00:04:33,040 --> 00:04:36,000
you know honestly it is whoever we get

130
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:37,360
along with the best

131
00:04:37,360 --> 00:04:39,680
you know whoever is it's very important

132
00:04:39,680 --> 00:04:41,280
when you're starting

133
00:04:41,280 --> 00:04:43,440
to roll out a program like this uh to

134
00:04:43,440 --> 00:04:45,440
identify linchpins

135
00:04:45,440 --> 00:04:48,160
in uh your amongst your peers the ones

136
00:04:48,160 --> 00:04:49,199
who are

137
00:04:49,199 --> 00:04:50,880
well respected the ones who know

138
00:04:50,880 --> 00:04:52,479
everybody uh

139
00:04:52,479 --> 00:04:54,400
the ones who have a lot of influence the

140
00:04:54,400 --> 00:04:55,600
ones who are most

141
00:04:55,600 --> 00:04:58,800
receptive to your ideas and they're

142
00:04:58,800 --> 00:05:00,880
going to be some in the executive ranks

143
00:05:00,880 --> 00:05:02,240
and they're going to be some

144
00:05:02,240 --> 00:05:04,240
um you know kind of in the grass roots

145
00:05:04,240 --> 00:05:06,000
and you want to hit both sides

146
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:08,080
you cannot just go to an executive and

147
00:05:08,080 --> 00:05:09,680
say right they'll just tell everybody to

148
00:05:09,680 --> 00:05:11,440
do this and it'll happen

149
00:05:11,440 --> 00:05:14,479
so you have to plant your seeds very

150
00:05:14,479 --> 00:05:15,280
carefully

151
00:05:15,280 --> 00:05:18,240
and you know identify sometimes it's not

152
00:05:18,240 --> 00:05:20,080
the most critical group but it's the

153
00:05:20,080 --> 00:05:20,720
most

154
00:05:20,720 --> 00:05:22,880
security friendly group i guess i'll put

155
00:05:22,880 --> 00:05:23,919
it that way

156
00:05:23,919 --> 00:05:25,680
and is it an important step wendy in

157
00:05:25,680 --> 00:05:27,039
terms of when you pick

158
00:05:27,039 --> 00:05:28,960
that first group how how crucial is it

159
00:05:28,960 --> 00:05:30,560
that that you know if you make a mistake

160
00:05:30,560 --> 00:05:31,440
there

161
00:05:31,440 --> 00:05:33,680
does it does it wobble the whole program

162
00:05:33,680 --> 00:05:35,840
is it an important first

163
00:05:35,840 --> 00:05:39,039
decision it depends on you know how big

164
00:05:39,039 --> 00:05:42,479
the mistake is that you make

165
00:05:42,479 --> 00:05:44,639
but again this is this is one of the

166
00:05:44,639 --> 00:05:46,000
most difficult

167
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:49,280
social engineering uh projects that

168
00:05:49,280 --> 00:05:50,080
there is

169
00:05:50,080 --> 00:05:52,080
you know it's not like just getting

170
00:05:52,080 --> 00:05:53,840
somebody to click on something

171
00:05:53,840 --> 00:05:57,120
it is you know making culture change

172
00:05:57,120 --> 00:05:59,120
and getting everyone to accept it it

173
00:05:59,120 --> 00:06:00,720
requires a lot of

174
00:06:00,720 --> 00:06:04,319
persuasion and and a lot of social work

175
00:06:04,319 --> 00:06:06,880
so uh hopefully you'll be thinking about

176
00:06:06,880 --> 00:06:07,840
this before you

177
00:06:07,840 --> 00:06:10,479
start you're not going to be trying to

178
00:06:10,479 --> 00:06:11,680
force anything on

179
00:06:11,680 --> 00:06:14,479
anybody and sometimes it'll take longer

180
00:06:14,479 --> 00:06:15,840
than you think

181
00:06:15,840 --> 00:06:19,280
um but if you just you know gently and

182
00:06:19,280 --> 00:06:20,720
steadily

183
00:06:20,720 --> 00:06:24,639
continue engaging um and i'll say bribes

184
00:06:24,639 --> 00:06:27,680
help you know find out what they like

185
00:06:27,680 --> 00:06:30,000
you know take them out to lunch or

186
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:32,160
whatever you can do at this distance

187
00:06:32,160 --> 00:06:35,039
yeah yeah any uh any comments on that

188
00:06:35,039 --> 00:06:35,840
anyway does that

189
00:06:35,840 --> 00:06:37,600
that ring true for people not not the

190
00:06:37,600 --> 00:06:40,319
bride's bit but just anything in general

191
00:06:40,319 --> 00:06:45,120
the bribes i have baked cookies for work

192
00:06:45,120 --> 00:06:48,000
so many times if you go up to a bunch of

193
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:49,680
devs and you're like yeah so i made some

194
00:06:49,680 --> 00:06:50,800
cookies

195
00:06:50,800 --> 00:06:52,479
and i was just wondering if you all want

196
00:06:52,479 --> 00:06:54,479
some also i'm going to talk about

197
00:06:54,479 --> 00:06:55,919
security

198
00:06:55,919 --> 00:06:59,599
and it works exactly that's what happens

199
00:06:59,599 --> 00:07:01,840
one time i flew back from switzerland

200
00:07:01,840 --> 00:07:02,160
for

201
00:07:02,160 --> 00:07:04,880
just a couple of days and i had just one

202
00:07:04,880 --> 00:07:06,639
handbag with me carry on

203
00:07:06,639 --> 00:07:08,479
most of it was swiss chocolate and there

204
00:07:08,479 --> 00:07:10,400
were like three t-shirts in it

205
00:07:10,400 --> 00:07:12,720
and the chocolate was all for the help

206
00:07:12,720 --> 00:07:14,880
deck

207
00:07:14,880 --> 00:07:17,440
you know you do what you got to do i

208
00:07:17,440 --> 00:07:19,599
mean i think that point about uh

209
00:07:19,599 --> 00:07:23,039
about um you know finding finding your

210
00:07:23,039 --> 00:07:24,560
your kind of supporters at the

211
00:07:24,560 --> 00:07:26,560
grassroots is super important for any of

212
00:07:26,560 --> 00:07:27,360
these

213
00:07:27,360 --> 00:07:29,759
um these kind of transformational

214
00:07:29,759 --> 00:07:31,360
projects right and i mean in some ways

215
00:07:31,360 --> 00:07:31,919
you know

216
00:07:31,919 --> 00:07:34,639
we yes we're talking about about um

217
00:07:34,639 --> 00:07:36,800
security projects here but

218
00:07:36,800 --> 00:07:39,440
you know this is the the the kind of uh

219
00:07:39,440 --> 00:07:40,960
the thinking behind this is

220
00:07:40,960 --> 00:07:42,639
is not that different from when we

221
00:07:42,639 --> 00:07:44,160
transitioned from

222
00:07:44,160 --> 00:07:46,560
you know waterfall to agile or from you

223
00:07:46,560 --> 00:07:48,720
know old style system administration to

224
00:07:48,720 --> 00:07:50,240
devops right because they're

225
00:07:50,240 --> 00:07:52,240
they're organizational changes that a

226
00:07:52,240 --> 00:07:54,000
lot of people can find

227
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:56,720
frightening both you know both folks on

228
00:07:56,720 --> 00:07:58,080
the ground and

229
00:07:58,080 --> 00:08:01,120
you know and um and and c-suite folks

230
00:08:01,120 --> 00:08:01,840
and so

231
00:08:01,840 --> 00:08:03,840
you know finding those those those

232
00:08:03,840 --> 00:08:05,120
support points i think

233
00:08:05,120 --> 00:08:08,400
is uh is uh is super important and

234
00:08:08,400 --> 00:08:10,240
you know i mean if you can find uh if

235
00:08:10,240 --> 00:08:11,759
you can find an initial team that's

236
00:08:11,759 --> 00:08:13,039
outside of your

237
00:08:13,039 --> 00:08:16,720
critical product delivery uh

238
00:08:16,720 --> 00:08:19,919
kind of uh pipe then that's probably

239
00:08:19,919 --> 00:08:20,800
always a good

240
00:08:20,800 --> 00:08:23,919
a good option as well and i think yeah i

241
00:08:23,919 --> 00:08:25,520
totally agree the grassroots

242
00:08:25,520 --> 00:08:27,199
approach is is very important i'd love

243
00:08:27,199 --> 00:08:28,879
to tell you i'd love to bring you in

244
00:08:28,879 --> 00:08:30,479
here just just to talk about that

245
00:08:30,479 --> 00:08:32,320
grassroots acceptance

246
00:08:32,320 --> 00:08:34,000
bringing in developers and getting them

247
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:35,839
on board because it's it's one thing

248
00:08:35,839 --> 00:08:37,279
telling a developer or telling a group

249
00:08:37,279 --> 00:08:38,399
of developers you know this is really

250
00:08:38,399 --> 00:08:40,000
important we need you to do this

251
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:42,958
but in terms of how you actually get

252
00:08:42,958 --> 00:08:45,440
developers to buy into the idea

253
00:08:45,440 --> 00:08:48,320
and and believe the value what are your

254
00:08:48,320 --> 00:08:50,640
strategies suggestions to them

255
00:08:50,640 --> 00:08:53,279
so i really like what wendy said how she

256
00:08:53,279 --> 00:08:54,959
said it's the team you get along with

257
00:08:54,959 --> 00:08:55,600
the most

258
00:08:55,600 --> 00:08:57,600
and so when she said that my immediate

259
00:08:57,600 --> 00:08:59,440
thought was yeah because you've spent

260
00:08:59,440 --> 00:09:00,320
all this time

261
00:09:00,320 --> 00:09:03,680
building trust with them and so like

262
00:09:03,680 --> 00:09:06,240
they know her they know her team they

263
00:09:06,240 --> 00:09:08,160
get along with her because they trust

264
00:09:08,160 --> 00:09:10,399
her and her team that they've got their

265
00:09:10,399 --> 00:09:11,600
best interests at heart and they're

266
00:09:11,600 --> 00:09:13,920
trying to help them make secure stuff

267
00:09:13,920 --> 00:09:17,200
and so i feel like usually when i try to

268
00:09:17,200 --> 00:09:18,000
recruit

269
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:19,760
people at first and get them engaged and

270
00:09:19,760 --> 00:09:21,839
get them interested so building trust is

271
00:09:21,839 --> 00:09:22,800
important and building

272
00:09:22,800 --> 00:09:25,120
interest so for instance like having a

273
00:09:25,120 --> 00:09:26,480
lunch and learn and saying like i'm

274
00:09:26,480 --> 00:09:27,519
going to show the new

275
00:09:27,519 --> 00:09:29,440
cool security tool who wants to come see

276
00:09:29,440 --> 00:09:32,959
me smash things

277
00:09:33,680 --> 00:09:37,600
and also explaining um so sometimes what

278
00:09:37,600 --> 00:09:39,200
security people do is they'll explain

279
00:09:39,200 --> 00:09:40,720
the risk but

280
00:09:40,720 --> 00:09:42,800
the sky is completely falling do you

281
00:09:42,800 --> 00:09:44,080
know what i mean they'll say oh well

282
00:09:44,080 --> 00:09:45,519
it's solar winds

283
00:09:45,519 --> 00:09:47,200
you know this thing happened because of

284
00:09:47,200 --> 00:09:48,480
that and it's like well you know what

285
00:09:48,480 --> 00:09:50,959
we're not solar winds and we sell

286
00:09:50,959 --> 00:09:52,640
you know this one product and we love

287
00:09:52,640 --> 00:09:54,240
this product and we make

288
00:09:54,240 --> 00:09:56,240
these applications to support this

289
00:09:56,240 --> 00:09:59,120
product but we're not as attractive as a

290
00:09:59,120 --> 00:10:01,120
candidate for solarwinds so if you can

291
00:10:01,120 --> 00:10:02,240
try to relate

292
00:10:02,240 --> 00:10:04,480
things specifically to your business

293
00:10:04,480 --> 00:10:06,880
when you explain stuff

294
00:10:06,880 --> 00:10:09,920
i've also seen some interesting ways

295
00:10:09,920 --> 00:10:11,519
that people recruit people so for

296
00:10:11,519 --> 00:10:12,240
instance

297
00:10:12,240 --> 00:10:15,040
one of my clients put i'm looking for

298
00:10:15,040 --> 00:10:16,399
security champions

299
00:10:16,399 --> 00:10:18,320
do you want to know how to be a champion

300
00:10:18,320 --> 00:10:19,920
ask me how and he put it into his

301
00:10:19,920 --> 00:10:21,360
signature

302
00:10:21,360 --> 00:10:23,120
of his emails and that was it and

303
00:10:23,120 --> 00:10:24,560
someone's like what's a champion and

304
00:10:24,560 --> 00:10:26,399
he's like yes

305
00:10:26,399 --> 00:10:28,240
two security champions and then of

306
00:10:28,240 --> 00:10:30,320
course the champions are the ones

307
00:10:30,320 --> 00:10:32,480
that they work with whenever they do a

308
00:10:32,480 --> 00:10:34,240
new proof of concept

309
00:10:34,240 --> 00:10:37,040
um another company that i was working

310
00:10:37,040 --> 00:10:38,480
with we

311
00:10:38,480 --> 00:10:42,079
we so our the apis were not as pristine

312
00:10:42,079 --> 00:10:43,839
as we would have liked them

313
00:10:43,839 --> 00:10:45,839
and so there was this tool we wanted to

314
00:10:45,839 --> 00:10:47,760
show them and so what we did was is the

315
00:10:47,760 --> 00:10:49,839
security team played with it first

316
00:10:49,839 --> 00:10:52,480
and we picked a team that like wendy

317
00:10:52,480 --> 00:10:53,279
said like

318
00:10:53,279 --> 00:10:56,320
that they like you and um and so what we

319
00:10:56,320 --> 00:10:58,640
did is we took one of their like 50 apis

320
00:10:58,640 --> 00:11:00,079
and we actually did the

321
00:11:00,079 --> 00:11:02,880
sas on it so we did code analysis on it

322
00:11:02,880 --> 00:11:03,600
already

323
00:11:03,600 --> 00:11:05,120
and then we actually fixed the whole

324
00:11:05,120 --> 00:11:07,360
thing like the two of us together

325
00:11:07,360 --> 00:11:09,600
and then we showed it to them we

326
00:11:09,600 --> 00:11:11,200
presented it to them so we're like hey

327
00:11:11,200 --> 00:11:12,320
we have this new tool

328
00:11:12,320 --> 00:11:15,279
and we wanted to show you and so we did

329
00:11:15,279 --> 00:11:16,000
one to

330
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:18,480
show you how it works and walk so it's

331
00:11:18,480 --> 00:11:20,079
like an ide plug-in that kind of

332
00:11:20,079 --> 00:11:21,440
corrects you like

333
00:11:21,440 --> 00:11:24,399
that looks bad and so we showed them

334
00:11:24,399 --> 00:11:25,839
we're like see and then you just do this

335
00:11:25,839 --> 00:11:27,040
and then you do that and it's kind of

336
00:11:27,040 --> 00:11:29,200
like we made a present for you

337
00:11:29,200 --> 00:11:30,800
we know you've been like struggling with

338
00:11:30,800 --> 00:11:32,880
the api security and so like now we have

339
00:11:32,880 --> 00:11:33,760
a tool

340
00:11:33,760 --> 00:11:35,360
where you can push all the way left and

341
00:11:35,360 --> 00:11:37,760
start where you're at not where we're at

342
00:11:37,760 --> 00:11:39,279
because we come in and pen test and we

343
00:11:39,279 --> 00:11:40,320
just like slap their

344
00:11:40,320 --> 00:11:42,880
apis down and that's a bad feeling and

345
00:11:42,880 --> 00:11:44,959
now we've made it so by the time the api

346
00:11:44,959 --> 00:11:46,560
gets to us we're like oh damn now we

347
00:11:46,560 --> 00:11:49,599
have to work really hard

348
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:52,320
and so we made it like because it is for

349
00:11:52,320 --> 00:11:54,240
them does that make sense and i've seen

350
00:11:54,240 --> 00:11:55,440
security teams where they're like you

351
00:11:55,440 --> 00:11:56,959
can figure out how to use it and you can

352
00:11:56,959 --> 00:11:58,720
do this but by making a little proof of

353
00:11:58,720 --> 00:11:59,680
concept

354
00:11:59,680 --> 00:12:01,519
and showing them we're like look we did

355
00:12:01,519 --> 00:12:03,519
this in like four hours and we figured

356
00:12:03,519 --> 00:12:05,120
out a lot of bugs for you and

357
00:12:05,120 --> 00:12:06,160
you know we can give you a little

358
00:12:06,160 --> 00:12:09,600
tutorial and almost like a gift

359
00:12:09,600 --> 00:12:12,720
from our point of view anyway i love

360
00:12:12,720 --> 00:12:13,600
that because

361
00:12:13,600 --> 00:12:16,480
traditionally security teams um the

362
00:12:16,480 --> 00:12:18,000
interactions are more oh we found some

363
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:18,639
problems

364
00:12:18,639 --> 00:12:21,279
here you go and hand off so this is more

365
00:12:21,279 --> 00:12:23,360
i'm providing you value i'm giving you

366
00:12:23,360 --> 00:12:24,000
i'm helping

367
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:26,320
you here which is which is a refreshing

368
00:12:26,320 --> 00:12:27,760
uh difference to how security has

369
00:12:27,760 --> 00:12:28,800
traditionally been

370
00:12:28,800 --> 00:12:31,600
been done um how about conversely any

371
00:12:31,600 --> 00:12:32,480
pitfalls what

372
00:12:32,480 --> 00:12:35,120
any common um things that people have

373
00:12:35,120 --> 00:12:35,920
done

374
00:12:35,920 --> 00:12:38,720
um to which you know on the on the face

375
00:12:38,720 --> 00:12:40,720
of it may look like it should work but

376
00:12:40,720 --> 00:12:42,880
but perhaps uh we want to avoid for

377
00:12:42,880 --> 00:12:45,600
various reasons uh wendy any thoughts

378
00:12:45,600 --> 00:12:48,800
um i think i love tanya's example of

379
00:12:48,800 --> 00:12:51,200
you know demonstrating that it can be

380
00:12:51,200 --> 00:12:52,160
done

381
00:12:52,160 --> 00:12:54,800
and you know giving them the first one

382
00:12:54,800 --> 00:12:55,440
for free

383
00:12:55,440 --> 00:12:58,320
you know kind of a taste uh you know and

384
00:12:58,320 --> 00:12:59,519
then hooking them

385
00:12:59,519 --> 00:13:01,680
but um the other thing is that you

386
00:13:01,680 --> 00:13:03,920
really have to walk it through

387
00:13:03,920 --> 00:13:07,519
um the whole process if you think ahead

388
00:13:07,519 --> 00:13:08,240
of on

389
00:13:08,240 --> 00:13:10,959
things that are going to happen um and

390
00:13:10,959 --> 00:13:11,519
and have

391
00:13:11,519 --> 00:13:14,320
answers for them because it's not just

392
00:13:14,320 --> 00:13:16,399
the remediation of the code

393
00:13:16,399 --> 00:13:19,920
uh for example when we were remediating

394
00:13:19,920 --> 00:13:20,959
something

395
00:13:20,959 --> 00:13:23,760
really big in legacy one of the

396
00:13:23,760 --> 00:13:26,480
requirements of the change control board

397
00:13:26,480 --> 00:13:29,600
was that you had to have a documented

398
00:13:29,600 --> 00:13:31,839
reason for every code change

399
00:13:31,839 --> 00:13:33,279
every line of code had to have a

400
00:13:33,279 --> 00:13:35,120
documented reason

401
00:13:35,120 --> 00:13:37,040
why you were having to change it which

402
00:13:37,040 --> 00:13:38,399
sounds really good

403
00:13:38,399 --> 00:13:41,279
until you get that first 500 page

404
00:13:41,279 --> 00:13:43,199
fortify pdf

405
00:13:43,199 --> 00:13:45,120
and you know you're having to trace

406
00:13:45,120 --> 00:13:47,360
everything you know traceability metrics

407
00:13:47,360 --> 00:13:48,160
that that

408
00:13:48,160 --> 00:13:49,839
you know would take months and months

409
00:13:49,839 --> 00:13:51,600
and months so

410
00:13:51,600 --> 00:13:54,560
you have to try to figure out where

411
00:13:54,560 --> 00:13:55,839
those pitfalls are

412
00:13:55,839 --> 00:13:57,440
and try to solve them ahead of time

413
00:13:57,440 --> 00:13:59,440
because if you're bringing something to

414
00:13:59,440 --> 00:14:01,040
the developers and they go

415
00:14:01,040 --> 00:14:03,199
well you know this sounds great but i

416
00:14:03,199 --> 00:14:04,720
know immediately it's going to crash and

417
00:14:04,720 --> 00:14:05,760
burn as soon as

418
00:14:05,760 --> 00:14:08,880
as soon as i finish this part then you

419
00:14:08,880 --> 00:14:09,760
still haven't

420
00:14:09,760 --> 00:14:12,959
made it easier for them

421
00:14:13,279 --> 00:14:17,519
and when we think about um

422
00:14:17,519 --> 00:14:19,839
the support we might need to to make

423
00:14:19,839 --> 00:14:21,120
these changes to introduce these

424
00:14:21,120 --> 00:14:22,800
programs matt i'll ask you a question

425
00:14:22,800 --> 00:14:23,680
which is

426
00:14:23,680 --> 00:14:27,120
um more focused on the the the bottom up

427
00:14:27,120 --> 00:14:30,079
versus top down approach um

428
00:14:30,079 --> 00:14:32,800
do you absolutely need management or

429
00:14:32,800 --> 00:14:34,079
exec support

430
00:14:34,079 --> 00:14:37,199
um to actually achieve this kind of

431
00:14:37,199 --> 00:14:40,560
rollout or are we really relying upon

432
00:14:40,560 --> 00:14:42,959
developers only to to adopt this by

433
00:14:42,959 --> 00:14:43,760
themselves

434
00:14:43,760 --> 00:14:45,920
with the help of the security i mean i

435
00:14:45,920 --> 00:14:47,440
think it's an interesting question isn't

436
00:14:47,440 --> 00:14:48,160
it because

437
00:14:48,160 --> 00:14:50,480
you know with my with my kind of

438
00:14:50,480 --> 00:14:52,399
organizational management hat on

439
00:14:52,399 --> 00:14:54,880
you know you would you would say well

440
00:14:54,880 --> 00:14:55,440
you know

441
00:14:55,440 --> 00:14:58,320
we're gonna we're gonna um uh you know

442
00:14:58,320 --> 00:15:00,079
create some pioneers and i'm a big fan

443
00:15:00,079 --> 00:15:02,000
of this pioneers settlers town planners

444
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:04,320
kind of model about all of

445
00:15:04,320 --> 00:15:06,320
these things involving these kind of

446
00:15:06,320 --> 00:15:07,519
changes and

447
00:15:07,519 --> 00:15:09,199
and you would think that that would be

448
00:15:09,199 --> 00:15:10,560
how you go about it but i mean as you

449
00:15:10,560 --> 00:15:12,320
know simon you know we see an awful lot

450
00:15:12,320 --> 00:15:13,279
of people

451
00:15:13,279 --> 00:15:15,839
um coming to us where they're they're

452
00:15:15,839 --> 00:15:18,000
actually their first thing has been

453
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:19,600
a development team has just come and

454
00:15:19,600 --> 00:15:21,360
done it themselves and then they've gone

455
00:15:21,360 --> 00:15:22,000
wow

456
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:23,839
you know we've got these fantastic

457
00:15:23,839 --> 00:15:26,399
results you know we're really actually

458
00:15:26,399 --> 00:15:30,079
enjoying you know having uh

459
00:15:30,079 --> 00:15:32,000
seeing vulnerabilities getting fixed and

460
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:33,360
then the organization

461
00:15:33,360 --> 00:15:36,160
goes what's going on over here and so

462
00:15:36,160 --> 00:15:36,800
you know and

463
00:15:36,800 --> 00:15:40,079
but but um so i i i think that

464
00:15:40,079 --> 00:15:43,199
there are there are both

465
00:15:43,199 --> 00:15:45,279
both ways are kind of valid these days

466
00:15:45,279 --> 00:15:47,040
and we certainly see more

467
00:15:47,040 --> 00:15:51,120
um uh kind of uh developers adopting

468
00:15:51,120 --> 00:15:51,600
things

469
00:15:51,600 --> 00:15:54,639
almost you know off their own back or a

470
00:15:54,639 --> 00:15:55,040
small

471
00:15:55,040 --> 00:15:57,440
team you know uh kind of working that

472
00:15:57,440 --> 00:15:58,720
out i think i think developers in

473
00:15:58,720 --> 00:16:00,399
general are much more

474
00:16:00,399 --> 00:16:03,680
aware of um the

475
00:16:03,680 --> 00:16:06,240
importance of of of security issues

476
00:16:06,240 --> 00:16:08,399
these days certainly you know over the

477
00:16:08,399 --> 00:16:11,519
the the breadth of my career you know

478
00:16:11,519 --> 00:16:12,000
it's

479
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:14,240
a radical change over the last 20 years

480
00:16:14,240 --> 00:16:16,399
from from it being a kind of

481
00:16:16,399 --> 00:16:18,320
annoying thing that somebody kind of

482
00:16:18,320 --> 00:16:20,079
made you do eventually

483
00:16:20,079 --> 00:16:22,160
but um you wanted to avoid as much as

484
00:16:22,160 --> 00:16:23,279
possible to

485
00:16:23,279 --> 00:16:25,839
to to people being uh being much more

486
00:16:25,839 --> 00:16:27,920
aware of it

487
00:16:27,920 --> 00:16:29,360
yeah kyra says to that last comment as

488
00:16:29,360 --> 00:16:30,800
well about things that people are being

489
00:16:30,800 --> 00:16:32,079
made to do and

490
00:16:32,079 --> 00:16:34,160
and and tanya back to one of your

491
00:16:34,160 --> 00:16:36,320
previous points of um

492
00:16:36,320 --> 00:16:39,920
i'd love to ask how uh you know

493
00:16:39,920 --> 00:16:42,480
when you did that scan by yourself and

494
00:16:42,480 --> 00:16:44,000
gave that gift to the development team

495
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:45,680
what was the next step like

496
00:16:45,680 --> 00:16:48,240
um how much are the development teams

497
00:16:48,240 --> 00:16:49,360
being part

498
00:16:49,360 --> 00:16:51,199
of the decision making of what they

499
00:16:51,199 --> 00:16:53,040
should do what they want to do how they

500
00:16:53,040 --> 00:16:53,680
do it

501
00:16:53,680 --> 00:16:55,839
versus what the security team are like

502
00:16:55,839 --> 00:16:58,560
presenting to the development teams

503
00:16:58,560 --> 00:17:01,040
well so with that specific organization

504
00:17:01,040 --> 00:17:02,959
we've worked together on and off for

505
00:17:02,959 --> 00:17:06,079
a long time and so we actually

506
00:17:06,079 --> 00:17:08,640
created a standard for secure coding and

507
00:17:08,640 --> 00:17:09,359
then we had

508
00:17:09,359 --> 00:17:11,839
held consultations with all the dev

509
00:17:11,839 --> 00:17:13,039
teams

510
00:17:13,039 --> 00:17:15,199
and got feedback not that much not as

511
00:17:15,199 --> 00:17:16,799
much as i would have liked and then we

512
00:17:16,799 --> 00:17:18,319
said okay so now it's a guideline and

513
00:17:18,319 --> 00:17:20,079
then eventually it's a standard

514
00:17:20,079 --> 00:17:23,199
and then we made an api best practices

515
00:17:23,199 --> 00:17:25,520
this is what we would like you to do

516
00:17:25,520 --> 00:17:28,880
um and then again it was a first it was

517
00:17:28,880 --> 00:17:29,919
a lunch and learn

518
00:17:29,919 --> 00:17:31,679
and then it was a guideline and then

519
00:17:31,679 --> 00:17:33,280
we're working towards it becoming a

520
00:17:33,280 --> 00:17:34,160
standard

521
00:17:34,160 --> 00:17:37,120
and then a lot of them aren't following

522
00:17:37,120 --> 00:17:38,240
the standard but

523
00:17:38,240 --> 00:17:41,679
it's new right and so and and also

524
00:17:41,679 --> 00:17:43,120
basically like we just got

525
00:17:43,120 --> 00:17:45,039
a demo of a tool so someone i've known

526
00:17:45,039 --> 00:17:47,039
for years started an api security

527
00:17:47,039 --> 00:17:48,480
company and she's like hey can i show

528
00:17:48,480 --> 00:17:49,840
you this cool thing i built and

529
00:17:49,840 --> 00:17:51,600
i'd seen it a year ago but gosh it's

530
00:17:51,600 --> 00:17:53,280
come far and so

531
00:17:53,280 --> 00:17:55,360
i was like what if we tried you know

532
00:17:55,360 --> 00:17:56,640
this and then we're just playing around

533
00:17:56,640 --> 00:17:58,400
with it we're like we love it

534
00:17:58,400 --> 00:18:00,240
it's really easy to use like let's show

535
00:18:00,240 --> 00:18:01,840
them and see how it goes

536
00:18:01,840 --> 00:18:03,440
and so they're like oh this seems neat

537
00:18:03,440 --> 00:18:05,120
but it was only like last week that

538
00:18:05,120 --> 00:18:06,480
we've gotten that far

539
00:18:06,480 --> 00:18:08,880
but previously with the same company

540
00:18:08,880 --> 00:18:10,320
like we built

541
00:18:10,320 --> 00:18:11,919
so some of them were using pipeline some

542
00:18:11,919 --> 00:18:13,360
of them weren't

543
00:18:13,360 --> 00:18:14,960
so we started making pipelines for a

544
00:18:14,960 --> 00:18:17,039
bunch of them and then we would put

545
00:18:17,039 --> 00:18:18,799
different security tools we wanted them

546
00:18:18,799 --> 00:18:20,400
to use into the pipeline

547
00:18:20,400 --> 00:18:22,400
so we made you know proof of concept

548
00:18:22,400 --> 00:18:23,840
pipeline we helped them fix all the

549
00:18:23,840 --> 00:18:25,360
things we got them to a good place and

550
00:18:25,360 --> 00:18:27,039
then we started showing it off to all

551
00:18:27,039 --> 00:18:28,559
the other teams we're like look what we

552
00:18:28,559 --> 00:18:29,840
did with this team

553
00:18:29,840 --> 00:18:31,360
don't you want to have a cool pipeline

554
00:18:31,360 --> 00:18:33,440
like this and so we made it so they

555
00:18:33,440 --> 00:18:35,120
could actually literally copy and paste

556
00:18:35,120 --> 00:18:36,000
the yaml

557
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:38,640
to make it the least friction possible

558
00:18:38,640 --> 00:18:40,400
so like you can literally copy and paste

559
00:18:40,400 --> 00:18:41,039
this if

560
00:18:41,039 --> 00:18:42,480
if you have a web app and it's doing

561
00:18:42,480 --> 00:18:44,320
this you could just copy it

562
00:18:44,320 --> 00:18:47,600
like this and so um slowly it's been

563
00:18:47,600 --> 00:18:49,200
like just rolling out because teams are

564
00:18:49,200 --> 00:18:51,200
like that seems cool then we met this

565
00:18:51,200 --> 00:18:52,240
one guy

566
00:18:52,240 --> 00:18:55,600
who made pipelines like 20 of them

567
00:18:55,600 --> 00:18:57,280
and so then we showed it to him and he's

568
00:18:57,280 --> 00:18:59,440
like get out of my way

569
00:18:59,440 --> 00:19:02,160
and then he added it to all of them for

570
00:19:02,160 --> 00:19:02,559
us

571
00:19:02,559 --> 00:19:05,360
and so it's been like this grassroots

572
00:19:05,360 --> 00:19:07,120
level even though we have support of the

573
00:19:07,120 --> 00:19:08,160
upper management i'm

574
00:19:08,160 --> 00:19:10,960
like they're the ones that pay me um but

575
00:19:10,960 --> 00:19:11,840
basically

576
00:19:11,840 --> 00:19:13,440
like having the dads be more and more

577
00:19:13,440 --> 00:19:15,280
interested and more and more aware

578
00:19:15,280 --> 00:19:16,960
and they keep doing like more lunch and

579
00:19:16,960 --> 00:19:19,039
learns and stuff like that and just

580
00:19:19,039 --> 00:19:21,280
it's been like an entire culture shift

581
00:19:21,280 --> 00:19:22,799
over the past i guess a year and a half

582
00:19:22,799 --> 00:19:24,960
that i've been consulting there

583
00:19:24,960 --> 00:19:27,520
and i could sell one hour a week so yeah

584
00:19:27,520 --> 00:19:29,360
yeah wow that sounds like a huge impact

585
00:19:29,360 --> 00:19:30,080
so

586
00:19:30,080 --> 00:19:32,960
and and that feedback um that cycle of

587
00:19:32,960 --> 00:19:34,400
you know gathering information from

588
00:19:34,400 --> 00:19:35,600
developers must be

589
00:19:35,600 --> 00:19:36,880
sometimes it's hard sometimes it's easy

590
00:19:36,880 --> 00:19:38,799
depending on the groups let's say

591
00:19:38,799 --> 00:19:40,720
let's say we work for a huge company

592
00:19:40,720 --> 00:19:42,000
with teams

593
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:43,760
globally distributed i don't know wendy

594
00:19:43,760 --> 00:19:45,280
if you know any of those but um

595
00:19:45,280 --> 00:19:48,720
how how do you how do you get um

596
00:19:48,720 --> 00:19:50,880
that feedback that information from

597
00:19:50,880 --> 00:19:52,000
developers at

598
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:55,600
scale um across a company like cisco

599
00:19:55,600 --> 00:19:58,640
oh at scale is really really hard

600
00:19:58,640 --> 00:20:02,320
because um as a company gets bigger

601
00:20:02,320 --> 00:20:05,120
you know it kind of splits into fiefdoms

602
00:20:05,120 --> 00:20:06,000
and everybody

603
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:08,480
has their own culture their own reasons

604
00:20:08,480 --> 00:20:10,080
for wanting to do things

605
00:20:10,080 --> 00:20:11,520
and sometimes you just have to do

606
00:20:11,520 --> 00:20:14,080
shuttle diplomacy and go around

607
00:20:14,080 --> 00:20:17,120
um because even with something as simple

608
00:20:17,120 --> 00:20:17,760
as

609
00:20:17,760 --> 00:20:21,440
a uh as a communication

610
00:20:21,440 --> 00:20:24,480
to all of these business units uh or

611
00:20:24,480 --> 00:20:25,440
departments or

612
00:20:25,440 --> 00:20:29,200
geographies um you can't just send

613
00:20:29,200 --> 00:20:31,840
one thing uh like at cisco and we were

614
00:20:31,840 --> 00:20:33,520
rolling out zero trust

615
00:20:33,520 --> 00:20:35,919
we we had these things that marketing

616
00:20:35,919 --> 00:20:37,840
crafted very carefully wanted to send

617
00:20:37,840 --> 00:20:38,400
them out

618
00:20:38,400 --> 00:20:40,880
but every business unit had their own

619
00:20:40,880 --> 00:20:42,799
communications people and they wanted to

620
00:20:42,799 --> 00:20:43,600
rewrite it

621
00:20:43,600 --> 00:20:46,240
just a little bit each time so it took

622
00:20:46,240 --> 00:20:47,600
forever

623
00:20:47,600 --> 00:20:50,080
for the communications to trickle down

624
00:20:50,080 --> 00:20:50,960
to everybody

625
00:20:50,960 --> 00:20:53,840
so if you want very close control over

626
00:20:53,840 --> 00:20:55,039
the messaging

627
00:20:55,039 --> 00:20:57,039
you have to go deliver it yourself

628
00:20:57,039 --> 00:20:58,080
rather than

629
00:20:58,080 --> 00:21:00,080
firing it off and just trusting that

630
00:21:00,080 --> 00:21:01,600
it's going to scale

631
00:21:01,600 --> 00:21:04,880
but um and again the personal touch is a

632
00:21:04,880 --> 00:21:06,480
lot better than

633
00:21:06,480 --> 00:21:09,600
sending a communique from on high

634
00:21:09,600 --> 00:21:12,799
for some some groups

635
00:21:12,799 --> 00:21:15,840
i i introduced them to apsec i got them

636
00:21:15,840 --> 00:21:16,720
together to play

637
00:21:16,720 --> 00:21:18,799
elevation of privilege if you know that

638
00:21:18,799 --> 00:21:20,400
card game from microsoft

639
00:21:20,400 --> 00:21:22,320
that adam shostak came up with a long

640
00:21:22,320 --> 00:21:24,559
time ago it's still there on their site

641
00:21:24,559 --> 00:21:25,440
you can

642
00:21:25,440 --> 00:21:27,760
download and print the cards yourself

643
00:21:27,760 --> 00:21:29,200
but the idea is

644
00:21:29,200 --> 00:21:32,559
to do threat modeling with everybody so

645
00:21:32,559 --> 00:21:34,559
i made it a card game and i brought

646
00:21:34,559 --> 00:21:36,320
snacks and you know this is when we

647
00:21:36,320 --> 00:21:37,760
could all sit together

648
00:21:37,760 --> 00:21:40,880
and everybody brought their particular

649
00:21:40,880 --> 00:21:43,039
project that they were working on to

650
00:21:43,039 --> 00:21:45,039
represent usually you all work on just

651
00:21:45,039 --> 00:21:46,720
one system together but i said bring

652
00:21:46,720 --> 00:21:47,679
your own

653
00:21:47,679 --> 00:21:49,360
because i was trying to get a lot of

654
00:21:49,360 --> 00:21:51,679
departments together at the same time

655
00:21:51,679 --> 00:21:54,640
and we all played it and the the object

656
00:21:54,640 --> 00:21:56,159
there is to identify

657
00:21:56,159 --> 00:21:59,120
as many attack paths as you can for your

658
00:21:59,120 --> 00:22:00,080
particular

659
00:22:00,080 --> 00:22:03,039
project and whoever does that wins now

660
00:22:03,039 --> 00:22:04,080
the sad thing

661
00:22:04,080 --> 00:22:07,200
is that whoever wins also has discovered

662
00:22:07,200 --> 00:22:08,559
the most attack paths

663
00:22:08,559 --> 00:22:11,520
into their software so they're gonna

664
00:22:11,520 --> 00:22:12,240
have to go

665
00:22:12,240 --> 00:22:15,280
and open a lot of tickets so everybody

666
00:22:15,280 --> 00:22:17,360
gather around and go oh we're so sorry

667
00:22:17,360 --> 00:22:20,080
we're really sorry but uh you know you

668
00:22:20,080 --> 00:22:22,640
just try to make it as fun as you can

669
00:22:22,640 --> 00:22:25,039
because as tanya was talking about it's

670
00:22:25,039 --> 00:22:27,280
really hard to convince

671
00:22:27,280 --> 00:22:30,400
them first of all that attacks can

672
00:22:30,400 --> 00:22:33,280
happen but even if you show them that

673
00:22:33,280 --> 00:22:34,720
they're feasible they'll say well who

674
00:22:34,720 --> 00:22:36,559
would want to do that

675
00:22:36,559 --> 00:22:39,679
and that's the other big thing that even

676
00:22:39,679 --> 00:22:43,039
management can't always really answer

677
00:22:43,039 --> 00:22:45,039
so that's that's a completely different

678
00:22:45,039 --> 00:22:46,159
thing uh

679
00:22:46,159 --> 00:22:48,480
entirely but they will often give you

680
00:22:48,480 --> 00:22:50,640
the benefit of the doubt on that second

681
00:22:50,640 --> 00:22:51,679
question

682
00:22:51,679 --> 00:22:54,559
if you let them take ownership of

683
00:22:54,559 --> 00:22:55,760
discovering

684
00:22:55,760 --> 00:22:59,200
you know what these threats are the uh

685
00:22:59,200 --> 00:22:59,679
the

686
00:22:59,679 --> 00:23:01,120
who would want to do that that sounded

687
00:23:01,120 --> 00:23:08,640
like you've heard that many many times

688
00:23:08,640 --> 00:23:11,840
um so why don't we switch across to some

689
00:23:11,840 --> 00:23:13,039
examples of

690
00:23:13,039 --> 00:23:16,320
or you know that we've that we've

691
00:23:16,320 --> 00:23:18,320
you know all done of um of rolling

692
00:23:18,320 --> 00:23:19,919
something out what are some of the best

693
00:23:19,919 --> 00:23:21,760
practices and if you have any examples

694
00:23:21,760 --> 00:23:22,640
that would be great why don't we stay

695
00:23:22,640 --> 00:23:25,120
with you when doing that

696
00:23:25,120 --> 00:23:28,000
uh best practices of rolling these out

697
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:28,320
uh

698
00:23:28,320 --> 00:23:30,960
we've already identified a lot of them

699
00:23:30,960 --> 00:23:31,520
and

700
00:23:31,520 --> 00:23:34,720
uh you know many of them are you know if

701
00:23:34,720 --> 00:23:36,320
a small team has already discovered

702
00:23:36,320 --> 00:23:38,159
something on their own try to build on

703
00:23:38,159 --> 00:23:38,640
it

704
00:23:38,640 --> 00:23:40,799
because then you can hold them up as an

705
00:23:40,799 --> 00:23:41,919
example people

706
00:23:41,919 --> 00:23:45,279
love to be shown as an innovator

707
00:23:45,279 --> 00:23:49,440
a pioneer whatever and you can say boy

708
00:23:49,440 --> 00:23:52,159
you know you are so smart you you just

709
00:23:52,159 --> 00:23:53,760
you know you figured out part of this

710
00:23:53,760 --> 00:23:54,960
problem already

711
00:23:54,960 --> 00:23:58,000
we're just gonna adopt this um

712
00:23:58,000 --> 00:24:01,440
and again other other best practices

713
00:24:01,440 --> 00:24:05,679
are understanding the particular culture

714
00:24:05,679 --> 00:24:07,120
of the team

715
00:24:07,120 --> 00:24:08,960
the the other thing that not a lot of

716
00:24:08,960 --> 00:24:10,880
people think about is that

717
00:24:10,880 --> 00:24:13,679
in older organizations where there's a

718
00:24:13,679 --> 00:24:15,520
lot of legacy software

719
00:24:15,520 --> 00:24:17,919
all resources for development are very

720
00:24:17,919 --> 00:24:19,520
carefully planned

721
00:24:19,520 --> 00:24:21,440
only for the things that are on active

722
00:24:21,440 --> 00:24:24,240
development not for anything that is no

723
00:24:24,240 --> 00:24:25,279
longer

724
00:24:25,279 --> 00:24:26,880
being developed even if you have to go

725
00:24:26,880 --> 00:24:28,559
back and remediate it

726
00:24:28,559 --> 00:24:31,039
that's a problem for the cio and the cto

727
00:24:31,039 --> 00:24:32,880
to schedule

728
00:24:32,880 --> 00:24:34,960
everything from left to right in those

729
00:24:34,960 --> 00:24:37,279
resources take somebody off of an active

730
00:24:37,279 --> 00:24:38,080
project

731
00:24:38,080 --> 00:24:41,600
to go back and rebuild this code

732
00:24:41,600 --> 00:24:42,960
remediate it

733
00:24:42,960 --> 00:24:45,120
and test it for as long as it takes set

734
00:24:45,120 --> 00:24:46,960
up the qa time

735
00:24:46,960 --> 00:24:50,240
set up you know everything uh and it's

736
00:24:50,240 --> 00:24:50,720
not

737
00:24:50,720 --> 00:24:52,720
it's not going to be this beautiful you

738
00:24:52,720 --> 00:24:54,559
know continuous integration thing where

739
00:24:54,559 --> 00:24:55,200
it happens

740
00:24:55,200 --> 00:24:58,400
25 times a day it's it's going to be

741
00:24:58,400 --> 00:25:01,840
old and painful and it's a business

742
00:25:01,840 --> 00:25:02,320
problem

743
00:25:02,320 --> 00:25:04,640
just as as much as it is a technical

744
00:25:04,640 --> 00:25:05,440
problem

745
00:25:05,440 --> 00:25:09,120
and so you're going to have to work with

746
00:25:09,120 --> 00:25:10,960
you know a lot more people than you

747
00:25:10,960 --> 00:25:13,279
think to go back and schedule those

748
00:25:13,279 --> 00:25:15,600
resources

749
00:25:15,600 --> 00:25:18,240
yeah no very good advice any other

750
00:25:18,240 --> 00:25:19,200
advice from

751
00:25:19,200 --> 00:25:22,559
tanya or all that i really liked what

752
00:25:22,559 --> 00:25:24,559
wendy said as per usual

753
00:25:24,559 --> 00:25:28,080
um so i i tend to

754
00:25:28,080 --> 00:25:31,440
try really hard to ask

755
00:25:31,440 --> 00:25:33,679
the devs opinion on things or the

756
00:25:33,679 --> 00:25:35,760
architect's opinion or the operation

757
00:25:35,760 --> 00:25:39,039
folks opinion and i think that the

758
00:25:39,039 --> 00:25:41,120
main reason is one because they know

759
00:25:41,120 --> 00:25:43,840
lots of stuff that i don't know

760
00:25:43,840 --> 00:25:46,880
um and also

761
00:25:46,880 --> 00:25:48,880
because they'll like not only will they

762
00:25:48,880 --> 00:25:51,760
add value but also when i talk to them

763
00:25:51,760 --> 00:25:54,880
i find that then they feel appreciated

764
00:25:54,880 --> 00:25:57,919
they feel heard and also

765
00:25:57,919 --> 00:26:00,000
a big a big sticking point that i've

766
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:01,760
discovered is like what

767
00:26:01,760 --> 00:26:03,200
what wendy was saying is that there's

768
00:26:03,200 --> 00:26:05,120
some legacy stuff

769
00:26:05,120 --> 00:26:08,320
that's happening and it's

770
00:26:08,320 --> 00:26:09,919
it like and it's it's out there it's

771
00:26:09,919 --> 00:26:11,440
still part of your

772
00:26:11,440 --> 00:26:13,120
portfolio you still have to take care of

773
00:26:13,120 --> 00:26:14,720
it right um

774
00:26:14,720 --> 00:26:16,480
and they're so worried when you tell

775
00:26:16,480 --> 00:26:18,320
them oh there's like this api standard

776
00:26:18,320 --> 00:26:19,679
coming or there's this coming or that

777
00:26:19,679 --> 00:26:20,480
coming

778
00:26:20,480 --> 00:26:23,520
they're fearful that they won't still

779
00:26:23,520 --> 00:26:24,720
have a job

780
00:26:24,720 --> 00:26:26,880
or they're fearful that people will be

781
00:26:26,880 --> 00:26:28,080
really angry with them

782
00:26:28,080 --> 00:26:30,400
and i'm like no we're a team i'm here to

783
00:26:30,400 --> 00:26:31,360
serve you

784
00:26:31,360 --> 00:26:33,279
so let's make a plan together of how you

785
00:26:33,279 --> 00:26:34,960
can get there it's not like

786
00:26:34,960 --> 00:26:36,240
you know it comes into force in

787
00:26:36,240 --> 00:26:37,840
september and i'm gonna run over with a

788
00:26:37,840 --> 00:26:39,840
stick and whack your hands

789
00:26:39,840 --> 00:26:42,880
it's it's let's make a plan that's maybe

790
00:26:42,880 --> 00:26:44,960
six months or 12 months or

791
00:26:44,960 --> 00:26:47,039
you know like a compromise that actually

792
00:26:47,039 --> 00:26:48,080
works i remember

793
00:26:48,080 --> 00:26:50,880
um the first place where i implemented a

794
00:26:50,880 --> 00:26:52,159
secure coding

795
00:26:52,159 --> 00:26:54,880
standard i i talked with all the devs

796
00:26:54,880 --> 00:26:56,159
and a lot of them were concerned i'm

797
00:26:56,159 --> 00:26:56,960
like how about this

798
00:26:56,960 --> 00:26:59,200
all new apps must follow the standard

799
00:26:59,200 --> 00:27:00,000
however all

800
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:03,279
old apps we're gonna do some compromises

801
00:27:03,279 --> 00:27:03,760
so

802
00:27:03,760 --> 00:27:05,760
the deal we came up with was if you have

803
00:27:05,760 --> 00:27:07,440
to fix a bug in one of the old apps

804
00:27:07,440 --> 00:27:09,440
which happened fairly regularly

805
00:27:09,440 --> 00:27:12,000
like you have to run os zap on it and

806
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:13,360
you have to fix

807
00:27:13,360 --> 00:27:16,159
like a critical thing that you find or a

808
00:27:16,159 --> 00:27:17,919
high thing you have to fix at least one

809
00:27:17,919 --> 00:27:18,559
bug

810
00:27:18,559 --> 00:27:19,919
and then a lot of them what would happen

811
00:27:19,919 --> 00:27:21,360
is they're like well i'll just fix all

812
00:27:21,360 --> 00:27:21,919
of them

813
00:27:21,919 --> 00:27:22,960
do you know what i mean they're like

814
00:27:22,960 --> 00:27:25,360
i'll just fix two or three or whatever

815
00:27:25,360 --> 00:27:28,240
tanya um and so every time they would

816
00:27:28,240 --> 00:27:30,880
fix a bug they'd be like well i ran sap

817
00:27:30,880 --> 00:27:32,159
and there was like this one thing that

818
00:27:32,159 --> 00:27:34,720
looked really bad so i fixed it and so

819
00:27:34,720 --> 00:27:37,039
although it wasn't a perfect solution

820
00:27:37,039 --> 00:27:38,640
and some of the apps still didn't get

821
00:27:38,640 --> 00:27:40,320
attention for a while

822
00:27:40,320 --> 00:27:42,880
it it brought a lot of them up just a

823
00:27:42,880 --> 00:27:45,120
bit so it was less terrifying because

824
00:27:45,120 --> 00:27:49,360
the first scans were like

825
00:27:49,360 --> 00:27:51,600
but then after a while the scans were a

826
00:27:51,600 --> 00:27:52,480
lot better

827
00:27:52,480 --> 00:27:55,760
and it it was it was good and so and we

828
00:27:55,760 --> 00:27:56,880
also implemented

829
00:27:56,880 --> 00:27:58,960
so i wasn't allowed to buy anything for

830
00:27:58,960 --> 00:28:00,080
the devs

831
00:28:00,080 --> 00:28:02,399
bribery was totally discouraged there

832
00:28:02,399 --> 00:28:03,120
and so

833
00:28:03,120 --> 00:28:05,520
what i would do was give high fives so

834
00:28:05,520 --> 00:28:06,799
it sounds really weird but i

835
00:28:06,799 --> 00:28:08,720
i would say like if you fix a bug in a

836
00:28:08,720 --> 00:28:11,840
legacy app or if on a new app you scan

837
00:28:11,840 --> 00:28:14,480
and you don't have any highs like

838
00:28:14,480 --> 00:28:16,240
criticals highs or mediums if you have

839
00:28:16,240 --> 00:28:18,240
fixed all those before it gets to me

840
00:28:18,240 --> 00:28:21,440
when it's my turn and i'm on it if i

841
00:28:21,440 --> 00:28:23,279
don't find any criticals or highs i'm

842
00:28:23,279 --> 00:28:25,039
gonna run to your desk and i would high

843
00:28:25,039 --> 00:28:25,919
five them

844
00:28:25,919 --> 00:28:28,559
really loudly and the high five from

845
00:28:28,559 --> 00:28:30,080
tonya meant

846
00:28:30,080 --> 00:28:32,320
oh they did a good job and we had this

847
00:28:32,320 --> 00:28:33,679
open floor plan so

848
00:28:33,679 --> 00:28:35,360
everyone would see it and you would hear

849
00:28:35,360 --> 00:28:37,039
the right

850
00:28:37,039 --> 00:28:39,120
and it really really made a difference

851
00:28:39,120 --> 00:28:40,240
um

852
00:28:40,240 --> 00:28:42,399
and i remember one of the big executives

853
00:28:42,399 --> 00:28:44,000
was over there once and he saw me kind

854
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:44,640
of trot

855
00:28:44,640 --> 00:28:47,120
off to the dev area high five someone

856
00:28:47,120 --> 00:28:48,559
really lovely and then trot back he's

857
00:28:48,559 --> 00:28:49,520
like

858
00:28:49,520 --> 00:28:54,960
what is tanya doing and i'm like apptech

859
00:28:55,200 --> 00:28:57,679
but it it worked it created like a much

860
00:28:57,679 --> 00:28:59,120
better relationship

861
00:28:59,120 --> 00:29:00,960
to like to be clear that place i had

862
00:29:00,960 --> 00:29:02,720
been one of the devs and leading one of

863
00:29:02,720 --> 00:29:04,080
the devs teams and i switched to

864
00:29:04,080 --> 00:29:05,039
security so

865
00:29:05,039 --> 00:29:07,120
most of them already knew me but it

866
00:29:07,120 --> 00:29:09,200
created like this positive reinforcement

867
00:29:09,200 --> 00:29:11,120
as opposed to like a negative

868
00:29:11,120 --> 00:29:13,600
reinforcement like you are bad you did

869
00:29:13,600 --> 00:29:14,399
this

870
00:29:14,399 --> 00:29:16,640
um it was more like you're great you did

871
00:29:16,640 --> 00:29:18,320
excellent thank you

872
00:29:18,320 --> 00:29:20,320
high five driven security i love it it's

873
00:29:20,320 --> 00:29:21,520
a we'll have to

874
00:29:21,520 --> 00:29:26,000
let the trademark let the high five i

875
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:27,600
absolutely agree with all that the one

876
00:29:27,600 --> 00:29:29,360
thing i i would probably add is over

877
00:29:29,360 --> 00:29:30,399
communicate

878
00:29:30,399 --> 00:29:31,840
you know if you think you're over

879
00:29:31,840 --> 00:29:34,000
communicating communicate even

880
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:38,000
more because you know uh i i think it's

881
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:41,200
uh it's easy to assume that people have

882
00:29:41,200 --> 00:29:43,120
have heard your message and understood

883
00:29:43,120 --> 00:29:44,399
you and uh

884
00:29:44,399 --> 00:29:46,799
and um you know people come and say well

885
00:29:46,799 --> 00:29:48,480
i didn't know anything about that

886
00:29:48,480 --> 00:29:51,200
but what about the 10 emails and the

887
00:29:51,200 --> 00:29:54,960
lunch and learn missed them all

888
00:29:54,960 --> 00:29:58,399
so yeah cool well

889
00:29:58,399 --> 00:30:01,520
let me switch oh sorry tanya oh not

890
00:30:01,520 --> 00:30:03,760
being in person kinda stinks

891
00:30:03,760 --> 00:30:05,600
right now because the thing that i would

892
00:30:05,600 --> 00:30:07,120
do is i would just

893
00:30:07,120 --> 00:30:09,200
pretend to have a reason to walk by

894
00:30:09,200 --> 00:30:10,640
their desk

895
00:30:10,640 --> 00:30:13,600
and i would be like oh hi i didn't even

896
00:30:13,600 --> 00:30:17,120
see you there and i'd be like let's talk

897
00:30:17,120 --> 00:30:19,760
i tried to make it a more friendly thing

898
00:30:19,760 --> 00:30:21,440
does that make sense and also

899
00:30:21,440 --> 00:30:24,080
um one of the teams i used to work at we

900
00:30:24,080 --> 00:30:25,760
sat right in front of the kitchen and

901
00:30:25,760 --> 00:30:27,039
everyone has to go to the kitchen

902
00:30:27,039 --> 00:30:29,200
eventually and so i'd be like

903
00:30:29,200 --> 00:30:31,840
oh there he is i'd be like oh i'm just

904
00:30:31,840 --> 00:30:33,679
gonna make tea right next to you while

905
00:30:33,679 --> 00:30:37,840
you're making coffee

906
00:30:40,159 --> 00:30:41,760
what would today's equivalent be i guess

907
00:30:41,760 --> 00:30:43,600
i guess just passing passing someone

908
00:30:43,600 --> 00:30:44,000
where

909
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:45,120
you know close to where they live and

910
00:30:45,120 --> 00:30:46,799
giving someone an elbow bump i guess in

911
00:30:46,799 --> 00:30:48,320
today's times right that would be

912
00:30:48,320 --> 00:30:50,399
it's not quite as not quite as effective

913
00:30:50,399 --> 00:30:51,600
is it

914
00:30:51,600 --> 00:30:54,240
so so why don't we switch and talk uh

915
00:30:54,240 --> 00:30:55,840
rather than focus now on the bread

916
00:30:55,840 --> 00:30:57,919
on the depth of rolling out to an

917
00:30:57,919 --> 00:30:59,360
individual team let's let's discuss

918
00:30:59,360 --> 00:31:00,159
about

919
00:31:00,159 --> 00:31:02,399
you know when we well why don't we

920
00:31:02,399 --> 00:31:04,480
actually ask that question first

921
00:31:04,480 --> 00:31:07,039
how do we know once we've achieved some

922
00:31:07,039 --> 00:31:08,960
level of success which we've

923
00:31:08,960 --> 00:31:10,720
deemed to be successful which perhaps is

924
00:31:10,720 --> 00:31:12,559
another question but once we've

925
00:31:12,559 --> 00:31:14,399
deemed that we are successful within the

926
00:31:14,399 --> 00:31:15,919
groups that we are um

927
00:31:15,919 --> 00:31:20,559
working in at what stage do we then

928
00:31:20,559 --> 00:31:22,480
want to increase the number how fast

929
00:31:22,480 --> 00:31:24,559
should we grow and and should we

930
00:31:24,559 --> 00:31:27,200
use the same techniques as as wendy was

931
00:31:27,200 --> 00:31:29,760
mentioning in fact i'll ask wendy

932
00:31:29,760 --> 00:31:31,360
when you previously talked about you

933
00:31:31,360 --> 00:31:33,760
know pick the teams that you get on with

934
00:31:33,760 --> 00:31:35,360
most as the individuals

935
00:31:35,360 --> 00:31:38,399
do you continue that same flow

936
00:31:38,399 --> 00:31:40,559
in your growth there'll obviously be a

937
00:31:40,559 --> 00:31:42,320
limit to that just based on

938
00:31:42,320 --> 00:31:43,600
the number of people you'll know in the

939
00:31:43,600 --> 00:31:45,279
organization but what does that growth

940
00:31:45,279 --> 00:31:47,039
look like

941
00:31:47,039 --> 00:31:50,000
um at that point when you have some

942
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:51,840
successes under your belt and you can

943
00:31:51,840 --> 00:31:55,039
show that then

944
00:31:55,039 --> 00:31:57,679
successes generally help open other

945
00:31:57,679 --> 00:31:59,120
doors for you

946
00:31:59,120 --> 00:32:01,360
and that's when you you know you go back

947
00:32:01,360 --> 00:32:02,320
to uh

948
00:32:02,320 --> 00:32:04,480
executive teams and say we've been doing

949
00:32:04,480 --> 00:32:05,360
this here

950
00:32:05,360 --> 00:32:07,120
here's how we're doing it here's how

951
00:32:07,120 --> 00:32:09,760
it's working uh we've reduced our risk

952
00:32:09,760 --> 00:32:11,039
by this much

953
00:32:11,039 --> 00:32:16,480
um and uh try to find

954
00:32:16,480 --> 00:32:19,600
how to incentivize them further to make

955
00:32:19,600 --> 00:32:21,760
this a part of their objectives

956
00:32:21,760 --> 00:32:24,720
uh going forward and sometimes you can

957
00:32:24,720 --> 00:32:26,240
incentivize them

958
00:32:26,240 --> 00:32:29,840
with things that um make them really

959
00:32:29,840 --> 00:32:31,360
want to sign up

960
00:32:31,360 --> 00:32:35,840
and and that's easy uh and other times

961
00:32:35,840 --> 00:32:36,880
they're like you know we're

962
00:32:36,880 --> 00:32:38,720
overstretched as it is why should we

963
00:32:38,720 --> 00:32:40,320
take on something else

964
00:32:40,320 --> 00:32:42,240
when we don't even believe that this is

965
00:32:42,240 --> 00:32:44,399
a risk that's going to happen

966
00:32:44,399 --> 00:32:47,440
and and sometimes you can't

967
00:32:47,440 --> 00:32:50,799
win them all uh you can't uh

968
00:32:50,799 --> 00:32:52,240
you know you can't get those the most

969
00:32:52,240 --> 00:32:54,640
you can do is document it and say

970
00:32:54,640 --> 00:32:57,679
you know we tried we'll be back in three

971
00:32:57,679 --> 00:32:58,159
months

972
00:32:58,159 --> 00:33:01,200
and ask you again and then i'm going to

973
00:33:01,200 --> 00:33:03,120
keep asking you again i keep thinking of

974
00:33:03,120 --> 00:33:04,240
tanya now going by

975
00:33:04,240 --> 00:33:06,320
i'm going to walk by your desk again you

976
00:33:06,320 --> 00:33:08,720
know or i'm going to drive by your house

977
00:33:08,720 --> 00:33:11,120
i'm going to stand you know where you go

978
00:33:11,120 --> 00:33:12,399
to get your coffee

979
00:33:12,399 --> 00:33:14,720
in an inflatable t-rex suit and i'm

980
00:33:14,720 --> 00:33:16,480
going to ask you again

981
00:33:16,480 --> 00:33:20,880
um well i do that i have no pride

982
00:33:21,279 --> 00:33:24,480
you know trying to find those business

983
00:33:24,480 --> 00:33:25,200
levers

984
00:33:25,200 --> 00:33:28,000
to you know to keep spreading them out

985
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:29,440
and sometimes

986
00:33:29,440 --> 00:33:32,000
you will find that a group is willing to

987
00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:34,080
take it on for reasons you

988
00:33:34,080 --> 00:33:36,399
you know you wouldn't have anticipated

989
00:33:36,399 --> 00:33:37,279
or

990
00:33:37,279 --> 00:33:39,840
you know this is not a really critical

991
00:33:39,840 --> 00:33:41,039
thing but

992
00:33:41,039 --> 00:33:42,960
it does have a lot of dependencies and

993
00:33:42,960 --> 00:33:44,559
if you manage to do this this is

994
00:33:44,559 --> 00:33:46,240
automatically going to have a network

995
00:33:46,240 --> 00:33:47,760
effect and

996
00:33:47,760 --> 00:33:50,559
it's going to to fix a lot of other

997
00:33:50,559 --> 00:33:52,000
things

998
00:33:52,000 --> 00:33:53,120
some other things you're going to have

999
00:33:53,120 --> 00:33:55,120
to say that they will be saying oh we're

1000
00:33:55,120 --> 00:33:57,279
going to be retiring this so

1001
00:33:57,279 --> 00:33:59,760
we're not even going to fix it and you

1002
00:33:59,760 --> 00:34:01,360
know five years go by

1003
00:34:01,360 --> 00:34:03,840
and they still haven't retired it but

1004
00:34:03,840 --> 00:34:04,720
you know you

1005
00:34:04,720 --> 00:34:06,320
you do what you do what you can do

1006
00:34:06,320 --> 00:34:08,000
sometimes you take your little uh

1007
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:10,639
your little eight ball and just go okay

1008
00:34:10,639 --> 00:34:11,520
who's

1009
00:34:11,520 --> 00:34:14,960
up for security today um

1010
00:34:14,960 --> 00:34:17,199
i'm afraid i i don't have you know

1011
00:34:17,199 --> 00:34:18,079
really good

1012
00:34:18,079 --> 00:34:20,719
foolproof answers for that but i i bet

1013
00:34:20,719 --> 00:34:22,320
my colleagues here do

1014
00:34:22,320 --> 00:34:23,760
i mean i think you i think there's

1015
00:34:23,760 --> 00:34:26,800
always it's good if you can if you can

1016
00:34:26,800 --> 00:34:29,599
kind of create internal advocates for

1017
00:34:29,599 --> 00:34:30,320
for

1018
00:34:30,320 --> 00:34:33,040
any kind of uh of program you know

1019
00:34:33,040 --> 00:34:34,000
whether that's

1020
00:34:34,000 --> 00:34:35,599
champions within teams where it's

1021
00:34:35,599 --> 00:34:38,159
working already you know leveraging them

1022
00:34:38,159 --> 00:34:38,800
because that

1023
00:34:38,800 --> 00:34:40,800
they're they're the kind of authentic

1024
00:34:40,800 --> 00:34:42,480
technical voice right i mean

1025
00:34:42,480 --> 00:34:44,879
you know it's it's a much more more

1026
00:34:44,879 --> 00:34:45,760
likely to be

1027
00:34:45,760 --> 00:34:48,079
a well-received message coming from

1028
00:34:48,079 --> 00:34:49,599
respected peers

1029
00:34:49,599 --> 00:34:52,560
in some ways than than from you know a

1030
00:34:52,560 --> 00:34:53,040
kind of

1031
00:34:53,040 --> 00:34:56,639
uh top-down uh type approach so i think

1032
00:34:56,639 --> 00:34:56,960
i

1033
00:34:56,960 --> 00:35:00,720
i think uh leveraging those those uh

1034
00:35:00,720 --> 00:35:02,880
those kind of program champions at the

1035
00:35:02,880 --> 00:35:04,320
grassroots level

1036
00:35:04,320 --> 00:35:07,359
and and trying to create new advocates

1037
00:35:07,359 --> 00:35:09,119
and new champions you know

1038
00:35:09,119 --> 00:35:10,960
you get that sort of viral network

1039
00:35:10,960 --> 00:35:13,280
effect and and i think that's uh

1040
00:35:13,280 --> 00:35:15,950
definitely an approach that can work

1041
00:35:15,950 --> 00:35:17,119
[Music]

1042
00:35:17,119 --> 00:35:20,480
i i also feel that so i'm

1043
00:35:20,480 --> 00:35:24,720
big into data and using data to

1044
00:35:24,720 --> 00:35:27,760
get my way um so for instance

1045
00:35:27,760 --> 00:35:29,920
showing them listen we did scans of

1046
00:35:29,920 --> 00:35:31,040
everything

1047
00:35:31,040 --> 00:35:33,839
and these are our top three things and

1048
00:35:33,839 --> 00:35:35,920
i'm afraid of those things i've even

1049
00:35:35,920 --> 00:35:36,640
like

1050
00:35:36,640 --> 00:35:38,720
so i don't i have not written that many

1051
00:35:38,720 --> 00:35:40,480
exploits in my life but i've even

1052
00:35:40,480 --> 00:35:43,119
written an exploit to show them like i'm

1053
00:35:43,119 --> 00:35:43,520
really

1054
00:35:43,520 --> 00:35:46,560
upset about this one specific thing and

1055
00:35:46,560 --> 00:35:49,760
um so sharing those metrics

1056
00:35:49,760 --> 00:35:52,000
so for instance not specifics like

1057
00:35:52,000 --> 00:35:54,720
there's sql injection in this app

1058
00:35:54,720 --> 00:35:57,040
but i remember one client like we have

1059
00:35:57,040 --> 00:35:59,280
six active injection problems

1060
00:35:59,280 --> 00:36:02,720
this is completely unacceptable so

1061
00:36:02,720 --> 00:36:04,800
i like we worked with those teams and

1062
00:36:04,800 --> 00:36:06,800
fixed them then we talked with everyone

1063
00:36:06,800 --> 00:36:07,839
about it and did

1064
00:36:07,839 --> 00:36:11,119
um basically a deep dive into that topic

1065
00:36:11,119 --> 00:36:12,079
about why

1066
00:36:12,079 --> 00:36:14,640
it's so terrifying and how we did have

1067
00:36:14,640 --> 00:36:15,440
six and

1068
00:36:15,440 --> 00:36:17,200
now as far as we know we have none but

1069
00:36:17,200 --> 00:36:18,960
we're going to do a lot more scanning

1070
00:36:18,960 --> 00:36:21,040
and what they can do to fix it and kind

1071
00:36:21,040 --> 00:36:23,040
of get their buy-in of the danger that

1072
00:36:23,040 --> 00:36:24,800
could happen to them

1073
00:36:24,800 --> 00:36:27,680
um creating an exploit can really help

1074
00:36:27,680 --> 00:36:29,760
if there's a specific problem and that

1075
00:36:29,760 --> 00:36:32,880
one team is just pushing back or

1076
00:36:32,880 --> 00:36:35,040
for instance like some some places

1077
00:36:35,040 --> 00:36:36,800
there's kind of the technical architect

1078
00:36:36,800 --> 00:36:38,800
people and they set the standard for all

1079
00:36:38,800 --> 00:36:39,760
the devs

1080
00:36:39,760 --> 00:36:41,839
sometimes you have to battle with them

1081
00:36:41,839 --> 00:36:43,760
and i always try to be soft and gentle

1082
00:36:43,760 --> 00:36:45,040
and nice first but

1083
00:36:45,040 --> 00:36:47,200
i have resorted to sending them an email

1084
00:36:47,200 --> 00:36:48,960
that said click this link you've won an

1085
00:36:48,960 --> 00:36:50,079
ipad

1086
00:36:50,079 --> 00:36:52,079
and they're like tanya we know this is

1087
00:36:52,079 --> 00:36:54,000
from you and i was like we have 20 000

1088
00:36:54,000 --> 00:36:55,440
employees and one of them's gonna click

1089
00:36:55,440 --> 00:36:56,720
it so how about you click it and see

1090
00:36:56,720 --> 00:36:58,879
what

1091
00:36:59,680 --> 00:37:01,680
and then they're like wow that's awful

1092
00:37:01,680 --> 00:37:03,839
it looks just like prod i'm like that is

1093
00:37:03,839 --> 00:37:05,790
prod

1094
00:37:05,790 --> 00:37:07,280
[Laughter]

1095
00:37:07,280 --> 00:37:09,280
and then you know they're like well we

1096
00:37:09,280 --> 00:37:10,800
didn't think security headers mattered

1097
00:37:10,800 --> 00:37:12,800
that much and blah blah so we had this

1098
00:37:12,800 --> 00:37:14,880
nice discussion and they're like

1099
00:37:14,880 --> 00:37:16,800
wow that does seem really bad and like

1100
00:37:16,800 --> 00:37:18,400
right and don't we want to protect our

1101
00:37:18,400 --> 00:37:20,720
customers like those are our people

1102
00:37:20,720 --> 00:37:23,200
our customers are our people like the

1103
00:37:23,200 --> 00:37:24,000
devs

1104
00:37:24,000 --> 00:37:26,640
i i don't know um if you can remember

1105
00:37:26,640 --> 00:37:27,920
your dev days but

1106
00:37:27,920 --> 00:37:30,079
i loved making my customers happy and

1107
00:37:30,079 --> 00:37:31,599
the thought of something bad happening

1108
00:37:31,599 --> 00:37:33,520
to my customer it's like not on my

1109
00:37:33,520 --> 00:37:36,960
watch right so if you can show them like

1110
00:37:36,960 --> 00:37:38,640
this could hurt our customer it sounds

1111
00:37:38,640 --> 00:37:39,359
weird but

1112
00:37:39,359 --> 00:37:41,040
for me that was a huge motivator i'm

1113
00:37:41,040 --> 00:37:42,720
like this can't happen to

1114
00:37:42,720 --> 00:37:45,920
my customer jen or brad like those

1115
00:37:45,920 --> 00:37:46,400
people are

1116
00:37:46,400 --> 00:37:49,440
counting on me and so it really helps

1117
00:37:49,440 --> 00:37:51,920
encourage me yeah definitely and like

1118
00:37:51,920 --> 00:37:53,599
sharing the data can help

1119
00:37:53,599 --> 00:37:56,400
especially if if you see improvements in

1120
00:37:56,400 --> 00:37:57,359
the data

1121
00:37:57,359 --> 00:37:59,760
that's huge that makes everyone feel

1122
00:37:59,760 --> 00:38:00,560
awesome like

1123
00:38:00,560 --> 00:38:02,240
remember how the past three months we've

1124
00:38:02,240 --> 00:38:04,000
been targeting cross-site scripting

1125
00:38:04,000 --> 00:38:05,760
we'll guess what all of our new scans

1126
00:38:05,760 --> 00:38:07,520
are showing like a nose dive

1127
00:38:07,520 --> 00:38:11,040
all of you are amazing yeah

1128
00:38:11,040 --> 00:38:13,040
that's so funny that that reminds me of

1129
00:38:13,040 --> 00:38:15,359
one time that i heard about

1130
00:38:15,359 --> 00:38:18,480
a an application where the developer

1131
00:38:18,480 --> 00:38:21,599
deliberately used sql injection to

1132
00:38:21,599 --> 00:38:23,440
update the database

1133
00:38:23,440 --> 00:38:25,359
and i'm sure he thought he was being

1134
00:38:25,359 --> 00:38:27,440
clever you know this is really cool

1135
00:38:27,440 --> 00:38:28,880
let's do it this way

1136
00:38:28,880 --> 00:38:32,320
and yeah we all cried we cried that day

1137
00:38:32,320 --> 00:38:35,200
wow wow and i think it raises an

1138
00:38:35,200 --> 00:38:36,480
interesting point though doesn't it

1139
00:38:36,480 --> 00:38:38,720
about security education in general

1140
00:38:38,720 --> 00:38:40,560
that a lot of times when we when we're

1141
00:38:40,560 --> 00:38:42,880
taught about security

1142
00:38:42,880 --> 00:38:45,599
in the in our kind of work environment

1143
00:38:45,599 --> 00:38:46,079
it's quite

1144
00:38:46,079 --> 00:38:49,359
abstract right oh cves and you know this

1145
00:38:49,359 --> 00:38:51,359
but when you start showing people real

1146
00:38:51,359 --> 00:38:53,280
world exploits

1147
00:38:53,280 --> 00:38:54,960
you know people are like it sort of

1148
00:38:54,960 --> 00:38:56,880
changes their mindset about even people

1149
00:38:56,880 --> 00:38:59,040
who are experienced developers because

1150
00:38:59,040 --> 00:39:00,400
they've been thinking about it in a

1151
00:39:00,400 --> 00:39:02,960
fairly abstract way and then you go

1152
00:39:02,960 --> 00:39:04,800
well let's let's actually work through

1153
00:39:04,800 --> 00:39:07,359
this exploit and show what happens

1154
00:39:07,359 --> 00:39:10,320
and and people go wow okay i kind of

1155
00:39:10,320 --> 00:39:12,000
hadn't thought about it like that

1156
00:39:12,000 --> 00:39:15,760
yeah that is prod i love that yeah

1157
00:39:15,760 --> 00:39:17,760
we need t-shirts we need t-shirts for

1158
00:39:17,760 --> 00:39:19,359
sure

1159
00:39:19,359 --> 00:39:22,480
um so we're pretty much up that 40

1160
00:39:22,480 --> 00:39:24,000
minutes went quick right so why don't we

1161
00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:25,440
why don't we finish up with a with a

1162
00:39:25,440 --> 00:39:26,800
quick round up around that around the

1163
00:39:26,800 --> 00:39:28,160
around the houses here

1164
00:39:28,160 --> 00:39:32,079
um why don't we just um talk about our

1165
00:39:32,079 --> 00:39:34,400
biggest takeaway here or best practice

1166
00:39:34,400 --> 00:39:35,280
that you would

1167
00:39:35,280 --> 00:39:38,160
um recommend that people would pee that

1168
00:39:38,160 --> 00:39:39,359
people would try and

1169
00:39:39,359 --> 00:39:42,400
i'll i'll start i think i think

1170
00:39:42,400 --> 00:39:45,760
the next time i'm in a coffee shop

1171
00:39:45,760 --> 00:39:49,119
or in the office buy a coffee machine i

1172
00:39:49,119 --> 00:39:52,800
want a person in an inflatable dinosaur

1173
00:39:52,800 --> 00:39:54,560
outfit to high-five me that's that's my

1174
00:39:54,560 --> 00:39:56,240
i feel like that's a life goal now for

1175
00:39:56,240 --> 00:39:57,920
me i want that to happen

1176
00:39:57,920 --> 00:39:59,599
um and that would be amazing that would

1177
00:39:59,599 --> 00:40:01,119
be something i would talk to everyone

1178
00:40:01,119 --> 00:40:02,720
about afterwards so that's that's my big

1179
00:40:02,720 --> 00:40:03,440
takeaway

1180
00:40:03,440 --> 00:40:05,359
um why don't we go around it wendy why

1181
00:40:05,359 --> 00:40:07,040
didn't you start

1182
00:40:07,040 --> 00:40:10,240
um i love that i think the most

1183
00:40:10,240 --> 00:40:13,119
and i am for hire and i come with my own

1184
00:40:13,119 --> 00:40:14,000
um

1185
00:40:14,000 --> 00:40:17,119
i i i think we what we've

1186
00:40:17,119 --> 00:40:19,040
pulled from a lot of this is that you

1187
00:40:19,040 --> 00:40:20,640
have to go on the journey

1188
00:40:20,640 --> 00:40:22,160
with the developers this is not

1189
00:40:22,160 --> 00:40:23,839
something you can hand down from on high

1190
00:40:23,839 --> 00:40:24,319
and go

1191
00:40:24,319 --> 00:40:27,839
good luck um you have to walk with them

1192
00:40:27,839 --> 00:40:30,480
you got to be sam and go with frodo you

1193
00:40:30,480 --> 00:40:31,280
know

1194
00:40:31,280 --> 00:40:35,200
um you got to make the whole trip

1195
00:40:35,599 --> 00:40:37,599
that's just a little uh little homage to

1196
00:40:37,599 --> 00:40:39,359
sam uh sitting in the background there

1197
00:40:39,359 --> 00:40:40,160

1198
00:40:40,160 --> 00:40:43,680
sam to your frodo how's that yeah

1199
00:40:43,680 --> 00:40:45,760
wonderful thank you wendy i very much

1200
00:40:45,760 --> 00:40:48,079
agree with that uh tanya

1201
00:40:48,079 --> 00:40:50,480
i really liked so i felt all of us

1202
00:40:50,480 --> 00:40:52,480
brought this up and wendy started at the

1203
00:40:52,480 --> 00:40:54,240
idea of building trust with the

1204
00:40:54,240 --> 00:40:55,359
developers

1205
00:40:55,359 --> 00:40:57,119
and then building on that and then

1206
00:40:57,119 --> 00:40:58,400
teaching from there

1207
00:40:58,400 --> 00:41:01,040
and showing them as a glowing example so

1208
00:41:01,040 --> 00:41:02,960
we started with this team that

1209
00:41:02,960 --> 00:41:04,800
knows us and trusts us that we've worked

1210
00:41:04,800 --> 00:41:06,400
with a long time and look at their

1211
00:41:06,400 --> 00:41:07,359
success

1212
00:41:07,359 --> 00:41:09,520
and then proliferate from a positive

1213
00:41:09,520 --> 00:41:11,520
point i really liked that

1214
00:41:11,520 --> 00:41:14,000
excellent and finally matt yeah i mean

1215
00:41:14,000 --> 00:41:14,800
uh that's

1216
00:41:14,800 --> 00:41:16,400
that's exactly almost exactly what i

1217
00:41:16,400 --> 00:41:18,880
just wrote down you know

1218
00:41:18,880 --> 00:41:20,400
become that you know you've got to

1219
00:41:20,400 --> 00:41:22,319
become that trusted voice

1220
00:41:22,319 --> 00:41:25,200
and and you know so that on the one hand

1221
00:41:25,200 --> 00:41:26,560
and then the other one is is

1222
00:41:26,560 --> 00:41:28,880
find your champions you know and and

1223
00:41:28,880 --> 00:41:29,920
especially those

1224
00:41:29,920 --> 00:41:31,760
those grass roots you know because

1225
00:41:31,760 --> 00:41:33,680
they're your most important voices like

1226
00:41:33,680 --> 00:41:34,000

earlier you know those are the the that

1228
00:41:36,720 --> 00:41:38,720
that's the kind of uh

1229
00:41:38,720 --> 00:41:40,240
the thing that's most likely to win

1230
00:41:40,240 --> 00:41:42,720
hearts and minds is respected peers

1231
