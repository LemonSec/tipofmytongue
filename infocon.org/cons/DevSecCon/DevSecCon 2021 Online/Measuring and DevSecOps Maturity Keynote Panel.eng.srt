enthusiast and by extension i am a

47
00:01:41,200 --> 00:01:43,200
devsecops enthusiast

48
00:01:43,200 --> 00:01:46,079
uh about 10 years ago i you know by

49
00:01:46,079 --> 00:01:48,320
accident started the first devops days

50
00:01:48,320 --> 00:01:49,920
and i've been following devops ever

51
00:01:49,920 --> 00:01:52,159
since i've done many roles from

52
00:01:52,159 --> 00:01:52,960
developer

53
00:01:52,960 --> 00:01:56,399
manager system tester ci

54
00:01:56,399 --> 00:01:58,000
you know you kind of name it and i've

55
00:01:58,000 --> 00:01:59,759
run it over the years that's why i have

56
00:01:59,759 --> 00:02:01,600
the gray hairs

57
00:02:01,600 --> 00:02:04,240
and yeah kind of figuring out how we can

58
00:02:04,240 --> 00:02:05,200
collaborate

59
00:02:05,200 --> 00:02:06,960
better together and currently i'm at

60
00:02:06,960 --> 00:02:08,318
snake figure out how

61
00:02:08,318 --> 00:02:10,959
security comes into the fault so awesome

62
00:02:10,959 --> 00:02:13,040
and uh people call you the father of job

63
00:02:13,040 --> 00:02:14,400
not father of jobs right the father of

64
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:16,080
devops right well that too

65
00:02:16,080 --> 00:02:19,040
but did you uh this is a pre this is a

66
00:02:19,040 --> 00:02:20,480
pre-recorded session but did you

67
00:02:20,480 --> 00:02:22,080
did you get did you get a father's day

68
00:02:22,080 --> 00:02:25,360
card from devops uh yesterday patrick

69
00:02:25,360 --> 00:02:28,239
no that so it isn't uh the father they

70
00:02:28,239 --> 00:02:29,840
they say it's the godfather but

71
00:02:29,840 --> 00:02:30,800
godfather

72
00:02:30,800 --> 00:02:33,680
but it's it's not like in the uh mafia

73
00:02:33,680 --> 00:02:34,720
movies

74
00:02:34,720 --> 00:02:36,959
it's just like i'm being nice to them

75
00:02:36,959 --> 00:02:38,080
all the time no that's

76
00:02:38,080 --> 00:02:39,680
that's why they caught me like that

77
00:02:39,680 --> 00:02:41,599
excellent well what what a great panel

78
00:02:41,599 --> 00:02:42,640
we have today this is

79
00:02:42,640 --> 00:02:44,720
this is great great set of humans and

80
00:02:44,720 --> 00:02:46,160
people on the on the panel so excellent

81
00:02:46,160 --> 00:02:47,200
to have you all together

82
00:02:47,200 --> 00:02:49,360
um and let's kick off this um session

83
00:02:49,360 --> 00:02:50,480
why don't we take it back

84
00:02:50,480 --> 00:02:53,599
um to scratch and talk about companies

85
00:02:53,599 --> 00:02:55,920
that are just uh beginning their journey

86
00:02:55,920 --> 00:02:57,680
into devsecops and patrick i'll start

87
00:02:57,680 --> 00:02:59,840
with you in terms of the activities that

88
00:02:59,840 --> 00:03:01,040
an organization

89
00:03:01,040 --> 00:03:03,680
starts with when they want to go ahead

90
00:03:03,680 --> 00:03:05,680
and take the first steps into devsecops

91
00:03:05,680 --> 00:03:07,360
what do they typically what do you see

92
00:03:07,360 --> 00:03:09,120
they typically do to um

93
00:03:09,120 --> 00:03:12,480
to enter this brave new world so

94
00:03:12,480 --> 00:03:14,800
usually the first step is to kind of

95
00:03:14,800 --> 00:03:16,159
assess the pain

96
00:03:16,159 --> 00:03:18,400
right they kind of need to do an

97
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:20,239
inventory they need to know

98
00:03:20,239 --> 00:03:22,640
you know what security vulnerabilities

99
00:03:22,640 --> 00:03:23,840
they're facing

100
00:03:23,840 --> 00:03:25,519
what issues they're having so that's

101
00:03:25,519 --> 00:03:26,879
usually the first step

102
00:03:26,879 --> 00:03:29,599
is creating from the awareness like

103
00:03:29,599 --> 00:03:30,560
what's out there

104
00:03:30,560 --> 00:03:32,799
what are we like what do we need to fix

105
00:03:32,799 --> 00:03:33,840
um and that

106
00:03:33,840 --> 00:03:36,640
can go in both directions uh either they

107
00:03:36,640 --> 00:03:38,720
come already from a devops journey

108
00:03:38,720 --> 00:03:41,120
so they got the pipeline uh under their

109
00:03:41,120 --> 00:03:41,760
belt

110
00:03:41,760 --> 00:03:43,519
and they're now extending this to

111
00:03:43,519 --> 00:03:45,280
defcecops and they're putting like

112
00:03:45,280 --> 00:03:47,680
a lot of of the security tooling in

113
00:03:47,680 --> 00:03:49,280
there into their pipeline

114
00:03:49,280 --> 00:03:50,879
or they're completely new and at that

115
00:03:50,879 --> 00:03:52,239
time they're they're kind of like

116
00:03:52,239 --> 00:03:53,120
starting

117
00:03:53,120 --> 00:03:54,879
both and the collaboration between the

118
00:03:54,879 --> 00:03:56,799
teams and the technology journey

119
00:03:56,799 --> 00:03:58,640
but it usually all starts with an

120
00:03:58,640 --> 00:04:01,360
inventory like how big is the pain

121
00:04:01,360 --> 00:04:04,720
in our current company so that means

122
00:04:04,720 --> 00:04:07,200
checking vulnerabilities uh in open

123
00:04:07,200 --> 00:04:07,840
source

124
00:04:07,840 --> 00:04:11,120
in their licenses in their current

125
00:04:11,120 --> 00:04:14,080
processes and that's you know usually

126
00:04:14,080 --> 00:04:16,478
where they start uh their journey

127
00:04:16,478 --> 00:04:19,440
so it's very much like a visibility um

128
00:04:19,440 --> 00:04:20,880
starting point right not necessarily

129
00:04:20,880 --> 00:04:21,519
let's try and

130
00:04:21,519 --> 00:04:23,040
fix all these things but let's try and

131
00:04:23,040 --> 00:04:25,919
almost like take stock of what we have

132
00:04:25,919 --> 00:04:27,919
yes and if they don't feel the pain

133
00:04:27,919 --> 00:04:29,199
they're probably not going to start it

134
00:04:29,199 --> 00:04:30,320
so you might like

135
00:04:30,320 --> 00:04:32,560
tell them do death set cops do devsecops

136
00:04:32,560 --> 00:04:33,440
but if

137
00:04:33,440 --> 00:04:35,919
if they're the pain is not big enough or

138
00:04:35,919 --> 00:04:37,600
they're not aware of this they might not

139
00:04:37,600 --> 00:04:38,720
stir it but usually

140
00:04:38,720 --> 00:04:40,639
when they start you know they have an

141
00:04:40,639 --> 00:04:41,759
idea of

142
00:04:41,759 --> 00:04:44,000
something happen in production or

143
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:45,120
anything like

144
00:04:45,120 --> 00:04:47,680
during that pain is usually a good like

145
00:04:47,680 --> 00:04:48,320
starter

146
00:04:48,320 --> 00:04:50,240
uh and then the first thing is like in

147
00:04:50,240 --> 00:04:51,600
any incident

148
00:04:51,600 --> 00:04:54,080
you assess what's out there you try to

149
00:04:54,080 --> 00:04:55,680
assess the situation before you can

150
00:04:55,680 --> 00:04:56,080
actually

151
00:04:56,080 --> 00:04:59,919
fix that um yeah yeah i guess i'm

152
00:04:59,919 --> 00:05:02,080
just following on from from patrick that

153
00:05:02,080 --> 00:05:03,280
one of the things that i've

154
00:05:03,280 --> 00:05:04,960
noticed as well is just checking that

155
00:05:04,960 --> 00:05:06,320
teams have a common

156
00:05:06,320 --> 00:05:08,639
understanding of what devsecops actually

157
00:05:08,639 --> 00:05:10,880
means and then uh

158
00:05:10,880 --> 00:05:12,960
agreeing what your milestones are and

159
00:05:12,960 --> 00:05:14,400
making sure you're all on the same page

160
00:05:14,400 --> 00:05:14,800
i think

161
00:05:14,800 --> 00:05:16,560
a lot of people see devsecops as a

162
00:05:16,560 --> 00:05:19,120
destination rather than a journey and so

163
00:05:19,120 --> 00:05:21,199
they will um come into their mindset

164
00:05:21,199 --> 00:05:23,199
we've not done anything until we've got

165
00:05:23,199 --> 00:05:25,199
full automation everywhere from patch

166
00:05:25,199 --> 00:05:27,039
management through to change management

167
00:05:27,039 --> 00:05:28,560
rather than maybe agreeing hey here are

168
00:05:28,560 --> 00:05:30,240
some key milestones we want to hit and

169
00:05:30,240 --> 00:05:31,120
then measuring

170
00:05:31,120 --> 00:05:33,680
our maturity throughout that process

171
00:05:33,680 --> 00:05:34,479
yeah and

172
00:05:34,479 --> 00:05:38,240
i think like joining those pain points

173
00:05:38,240 --> 00:05:40,240
will take you onto that journey right

174
00:05:40,240 --> 00:05:41,520
your direction on that journey will be

175
00:05:41,520 --> 00:05:42,800
based off that pain

176
00:05:42,800 --> 00:05:44,639
as opposed to someone hearing devs

177
00:05:44,639 --> 00:05:46,720
devsecops maybe at a conference or

178
00:05:46,720 --> 00:05:48,080
something and say oh we need

179
00:05:48,080 --> 00:05:49,840
we need that in our org for no reason

180
00:05:49,840 --> 00:05:51,199
but we need that is that

181
00:05:51,199 --> 00:05:53,759
similar to what you've seen alyssa yeah

182
00:05:53,759 --> 00:05:54,320
i mean

183
00:05:54,320 --> 00:05:56,400
what's interesting is you look at how

184
00:05:56,400 --> 00:05:58,800
organizations get started into devsecops

185
00:05:58,800 --> 00:06:00,560
um a lot of times it gets driven by the

186
00:06:00,560 --> 00:06:02,560
security team because they're like hey

187
00:06:02,560 --> 00:06:04,160
you guys are doing this devops thing

188
00:06:04,160 --> 00:06:06,080
and we need to be involved and we're

189
00:06:06,080 --> 00:06:07,759
kind of sitting out here on the outside

190
00:06:07,759 --> 00:06:08,720
because

191
00:06:08,720 --> 00:06:11,199
we're not the best at like knowing how

192
00:06:11,199 --> 00:06:13,199
to be involved in that pipeline

193
00:06:13,199 --> 00:06:15,039
and so then it goes to the it like flips

194
00:06:15,039 --> 00:06:16,639
to the complete opposite where we had

195
00:06:16,639 --> 00:06:17,840
all these like really

196
00:06:17,840 --> 00:06:20,800
time consuming know practices and things

197
00:06:20,800 --> 00:06:23,039
we wanted to do in traditional security

198
00:06:23,039 --> 00:06:24,400
now we want to bring security to

199
00:06:24,400 --> 00:06:25,840
devsecops and it's like

200
00:06:25,840 --> 00:06:28,240
we become like hyper focused on tools

201
00:06:28,240 --> 00:06:30,000
and tools it's all about automation

202
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:31,280
we're going to automate the world we

203
00:06:31,280 --> 00:06:34,160
automate everything in security and so

204
00:06:34,160 --> 00:06:35,680
the the danger is that people tend to

205
00:06:35,680 --> 00:06:37,360
get frustrated when they realize they

206
00:06:37,360 --> 00:06:38,880
can't automate things

207
00:06:38,880 --> 00:06:40,319
and then it's like well how do we do

208
00:06:40,319 --> 00:06:43,039
this and so that's where i think

209
00:06:43,039 --> 00:06:45,360
um you know you see that early on in

210
00:06:45,360 --> 00:06:46,960
organizations as they're starting down

211
00:06:46,960 --> 00:06:48,240
that journey they

212
00:06:48,240 --> 00:06:49,680
start thinking they're gonna automate

213
00:06:49,680 --> 00:06:51,759
everything and then as they

214
00:06:51,759 --> 00:06:53,360
mature more and more they start to

215
00:06:53,360 --> 00:06:55,199
realize

216
00:06:55,199 --> 00:06:58,560
yeah maybe we need to think about people

217
00:06:58,560 --> 00:07:00,479
and process and how those things fit

218
00:07:00,479 --> 00:07:02,000
into play here and how we actually

219
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:03,840
make this a part of the culture rather

220
00:07:03,840 --> 00:07:05,039
than just

221
00:07:05,039 --> 00:07:06,560
oh we're gonna just take all the

222
00:07:06,560 --> 00:07:08,240
security things and

223
00:07:08,240 --> 00:07:11,360
you know tie them into a pipeline

224
00:07:11,360 --> 00:07:13,360
and do you agree with the activities

225
00:07:13,360 --> 00:07:15,520
that uh that patrick mentioned alyssa

226
00:07:15,520 --> 00:07:16,400
with uh with

227
00:07:16,400 --> 00:07:19,039
more of the like trying to identify what

228
00:07:19,039 --> 00:07:20,560
the pain points are then turning that

229
00:07:20,560 --> 00:07:21,759
into almost like a

230
00:07:21,759 --> 00:07:24,880
um a visibility kind of play in terms of

231
00:07:24,880 --> 00:07:27,599
understanding and and itemizing you know

232
00:07:27,599 --> 00:07:28,560
everything that you're touching and

233
00:07:28,560 --> 00:07:29,360
using

234
00:07:29,360 --> 00:07:31,440
i think the best ones do yeah i mean

235
00:07:31,440 --> 00:07:33,120
most of the time and you would hope that

236
00:07:33,120 --> 00:07:35,360
that's even just part of selling such an

237
00:07:35,360 --> 00:07:37,039
initiative is that hey we

238
00:07:37,039 --> 00:07:38,319
we need to look at where we are today

239
00:07:38,319 --> 00:07:40,880
and justify it i think sometimes

240
00:07:40,880 --> 00:07:42,080
you know patrick mentioned that

241
00:07:42,080 --> 00:07:43,919
post-incident world where

242
00:07:43,919 --> 00:07:45,199
you've had some type of security

243
00:07:45,199 --> 00:07:47,039
incident and now it's like oh we weren't

244
00:07:47,039 --> 00:07:48,400
doing the security things we got to do

245
00:07:48,400 --> 00:07:48,879
them

246
00:07:48,879 --> 00:07:50,639
there is a little bit of a rush to just

247
00:07:50,639 --> 00:07:51,919
like start slamming

248
00:07:51,919 --> 00:07:55,520
in sca tools and sas tools and

249
00:07:55,520 --> 00:07:58,080
and das tools and you know let's get all

250
00:07:58,080 --> 00:07:59,680
the different security scanners and

251
00:07:59,680 --> 00:08:01,680
let's buy up all the things and plug it

252
00:08:01,680 --> 00:08:02,960
in but

253
00:08:02,960 --> 00:08:05,599
i think you know the less it's driven by

254
00:08:05,599 --> 00:08:07,280
incident and the more it's driven by

255
00:08:07,280 --> 00:08:08,400
proactive

256
00:08:08,400 --> 00:08:11,199
uh just you know desire to improve

257
00:08:11,199 --> 00:08:12,240
security

258
00:08:12,240 --> 00:08:14,240
the better you see people kind of take

259
00:08:14,240 --> 00:08:16,080
stock first of where are we at now how

260
00:08:16,080 --> 00:08:18,319
do we road map where we want to go

261
00:08:18,319 --> 00:08:20,800
and then let let's then figure out what

262
00:08:20,800 --> 00:08:22,639
how we build those security practices

263
00:08:22,639 --> 00:08:24,639
into the pipeline

264
00:08:24,639 --> 00:08:26,400
and so this is an interesting part so on

265
00:08:26,400 --> 00:08:27,680
that road map then go

266
00:08:27,680 --> 00:08:30,000
on that journey once we plan that out

267
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:32,000
how do we know that the activities that

268
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:33,519
are going to take us on that journey and

269
00:08:33,519 --> 00:08:34,958
progress us through that journey

270
00:08:34,958 --> 00:08:36,399
how do we know they're actually going to

271
00:08:36,399 --> 00:08:38,000
be beneficial to us

272
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:40,559
and um what do we need to measure in

273
00:08:40,559 --> 00:08:41,919
order to be able to show hey you know

274
00:08:41,919 --> 00:08:42,399
what

275
00:08:42,399 --> 00:08:44,560
since doing this we've improved by this

276
00:08:44,560 --> 00:08:45,839
much how do we do that and

277
00:08:45,839 --> 00:08:47,360
surprise surprise my first measurement

278
00:08:47,360 --> 00:08:48,560
question is going to is going to you

279
00:08:48,560 --> 00:08:49,440
also in terms of

280
00:08:49,440 --> 00:08:51,760
you're the measuring queen uh in

281
00:08:51,760 --> 00:08:54,399
devsecops

282
00:08:56,160 --> 00:08:59,440
oh god no um but seriously uh

283
00:08:59,440 --> 00:09:00,959
i mean that's kind of the holy grail

284
00:09:00,959 --> 00:09:02,560
right and early on

285
00:09:02,560 --> 00:09:03,920
in organizations a lot of times they're

286
00:09:03,920 --> 00:09:05,279
just they're they're focused on very

287
00:09:05,279 --> 00:09:06,959
tactical things or the things are easy

288
00:09:06,959 --> 00:09:07,680
to measure

289
00:09:07,680 --> 00:09:09,600
if i've got tools running identifying

290
00:09:09,600 --> 00:09:10,880
vulnerabilities well i can look at the

291
00:09:10,880 --> 00:09:12,800
number of vulnerabilities and i can say

292
00:09:12,800 --> 00:09:14,640
hey my vulnerabilities went up or my

293
00:09:14,640 --> 00:09:16,640
vulnerabilities went down and

294
00:09:16,640 --> 00:09:18,720
i mean to a point that's that's valid

295
00:09:18,720 --> 00:09:20,240
right because

296
00:09:20,240 --> 00:09:21,839
total number of vulnerabilities if

297
00:09:21,839 --> 00:09:23,519
they're in prod

298
00:09:23,519 --> 00:09:26,240
that tells you what your risk posture is

299
00:09:26,240 --> 00:09:27,680
but the reality is we don't want to be

300
00:09:27,680 --> 00:09:29,360
catching vulnerabilities in prod and

301
00:09:29,360 --> 00:09:31,360
we're hopefully catching them sooner

302
00:09:31,360 --> 00:09:33,360
and so the number of vulnerabilities

303
00:09:33,360 --> 00:09:34,800
becomes less of a

304
00:09:34,800 --> 00:09:37,519
critical measure then really okay what

305
00:09:37,519 --> 00:09:40,240
are we fixing what's hitting prod

306
00:09:40,240 --> 00:09:42,560
you know can we look at things and start

307
00:09:42,560 --> 00:09:44,480
to really understand relationships

308
00:09:44,480 --> 00:09:45,760
between metrics

309
00:09:45,760 --> 00:09:48,800
so as we start to see organizations get

310
00:09:48,800 --> 00:09:50,800
again more mature in this or they start

311
00:09:50,800 --> 00:09:52,000
to move down that line

312
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:54,320
they move away from just measuring raw

313
00:09:54,320 --> 00:09:56,399
numbers of vulnerabilities and now it's

314
00:09:56,399 --> 00:09:56,800
like

315
00:09:56,800 --> 00:09:58,000
well let's look at you know

316
00:09:58,000 --> 00:09:59,920
vulnerabilities per release

317
00:09:59,920 --> 00:10:02,480
or you know where in the pipeline those

318
00:10:02,480 --> 00:10:03,519
vulnerabilities

319
00:10:03,519 --> 00:10:06,240
are being discovered or how many

320
00:10:06,240 --> 00:10:08,000
critical vulnerabilities that caused us

321
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:09,360
to break a build

322
00:10:09,360 --> 00:10:11,279
that we discover here or there and how

323
00:10:11,279 --> 00:10:13,279
do we reduce that number

324
00:10:13,279 --> 00:10:15,519
um you know you can even you can start

325
00:10:15,519 --> 00:10:17,279
to tie this back to even the backlog

326
00:10:17,279 --> 00:10:17,680
then

327
00:10:17,680 --> 00:10:20,399
where are we how many backlog items are

328
00:10:20,399 --> 00:10:21,600
getting created

329
00:10:21,600 --> 00:10:24,240
out of our security initiatives and and

330
00:10:24,240 --> 00:10:26,240
how does all of that start to relate

331
00:10:26,240 --> 00:10:26,880
because

332
00:10:26,880 --> 00:10:29,040
if you see your vulnerabilities go up

333
00:10:29,040 --> 00:10:30,560
and you see a 20

334
00:10:30,560 --> 00:10:33,440
increase in vulnerabilities what's that

335
00:10:33,440 --> 00:10:33,760
may

336
00:10:33,760 --> 00:10:35,440
indicate a problem but that could also

337
00:10:35,440 --> 00:10:38,720
be because oh if we look at our pipeline

338
00:10:38,720 --> 00:10:41,440
our deploys went up by 30 percent in

339
00:10:41,440 --> 00:10:42,880
which case now a 20

340
00:10:42,880 --> 00:10:44,320
increase in vulnerabilities is actually

341
00:10:44,320 --> 00:10:46,079
kind of better so

342
00:10:46,079 --> 00:10:48,160
you have to as as you get in this you

343
00:10:48,160 --> 00:10:49,680
really need to start to understand the

344
00:10:49,680 --> 00:10:50,560
broader on

345
00:10:50,560 --> 00:10:52,800
your picture of what's occurring within

346
00:10:52,800 --> 00:10:54,240
the environment you can't just

347
00:10:54,240 --> 00:10:57,600
focus on security measurements and

348
00:10:57,600 --> 00:10:58,560
metrics

349
00:10:58,560 --> 00:11:01,040
in a vacuum they have to tie into what

350
00:11:01,040 --> 00:11:02,560
are we doing in measuring

351
00:11:02,560 --> 00:11:05,120
our overall pipeline our deploys the you

352
00:11:05,120 --> 00:11:06,959
know time to deploy number of works in

353
00:11:06,959 --> 00:11:08,480
progress all the things that we're used

354
00:11:08,480 --> 00:11:09,360
to doing

355
00:11:09,360 --> 00:11:12,640
in that devops space

356
00:11:12,959 --> 00:11:14,480
yeah it's a it's a tough one isn't it

357
00:11:14,480 --> 00:11:16,240
because you're almost like you're trying

358
00:11:16,240 --> 00:11:16,720
to

359
00:11:16,720 --> 00:11:18,240
almost like measure the side effects

360
00:11:18,240 --> 00:11:19,600
almost that happen in the background

361
00:11:19,600 --> 00:11:20,800
when you make these changes

362
00:11:20,800 --> 00:11:22,399
it's a tough one to almost like

363
00:11:22,399 --> 00:11:24,240
associate as well is has this change

364
00:11:24,240 --> 00:11:25,040
actually

365
00:11:25,040 --> 00:11:26,240
produced those side effects or would

366
00:11:26,240 --> 00:11:27,839
those side effects have happened because

367
00:11:27,839 --> 00:11:28,959
of another

368
00:11:28,959 --> 00:11:30,880
you know the natural flow of my

369
00:11:30,880 --> 00:11:32,880
development or this feature wasn't going

370
00:11:32,880 --> 00:11:34,000
to cause that many

371
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:35,600
vulnerabilities et cetera it's a tricky

372
00:11:35,600 --> 00:11:37,680
one to to associate

373
00:11:37,680 --> 00:11:40,480
um how about sorry go ahead patrick i

374
00:11:40,480 --> 00:11:41,760
think you're going to add something

375
00:11:41,760 --> 00:11:45,200
no i think there's a tendency to

376
00:11:45,200 --> 00:11:48,000
kind of simplify the measurements uh in

377
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:48,640
a way

378
00:11:48,640 --> 00:11:50,320
that indeed we look at one or two

379
00:11:50,320 --> 00:11:53,760
metrics and that we focus on those

380
00:11:53,760 --> 00:11:55,920
but there's a funny thing with metrics

381
00:11:55,920 --> 00:11:58,560
if you focus too much on specifics

382
00:11:58,560 --> 00:12:01,920
you can get them better but they

383
00:12:01,920 --> 00:12:03,839
you know they might not have the effect

384
00:12:03,839 --> 00:12:05,200
uh you want it so

385
00:12:05,200 --> 00:12:06,959
you you really have to keep your eye on

386
00:12:06,959 --> 00:12:08,880
the ball and it's not

387
00:12:08,880 --> 00:12:10,480
only about reducing the number of

388
00:12:10,480 --> 00:12:12,639
vulnerabilities because if i hold

389
00:12:12,639 --> 00:12:14,480
you know all coding and i hold all

390
00:12:14,480 --> 00:12:17,200
deploys i'm happy too and i i can get

391
00:12:17,200 --> 00:12:19,040
that metric you know perfect

392
00:12:19,040 --> 00:12:21,839
but if if you know there's nuances that

393
00:12:21,839 --> 00:12:23,279
we we need to look at and

394
00:12:23,279 --> 00:12:26,720
and that's why the metrics should be

395
00:12:26,720 --> 00:12:28,639
used for interpretation

396
00:12:28,639 --> 00:12:31,279
and not per se as the final goal you

397
00:12:31,279 --> 00:12:32,240
know they give us

398
00:12:32,240 --> 00:12:34,480
input and information to make our own

399
00:12:34,480 --> 00:12:36,480
decisions but just making your decision

400
00:12:36,480 --> 00:12:39,600
on one metric is is just uh you know a

401
00:12:39,600 --> 00:12:41,200
problem uh for a lot if

402
00:12:41,200 --> 00:12:44,800
if you start doing that um

403
00:12:44,800 --> 00:12:48,320
yeah sorry no go ahead

404
00:12:48,320 --> 00:12:50,079
i was just gonna say your risk otherwise

405
00:12:50,079 --> 00:12:51,600
is you can drive the wrong behaviors

406
00:12:51,600 --> 00:12:52,240
right if you

407
00:12:52,240 --> 00:12:54,000
if you champion the wrong metrics the

408
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:56,480
wrong behaviors take flight and i think

409
00:12:56,480 --> 00:12:57,920
one of the things that i've seen is is

410
00:12:57,920 --> 00:12:59,040
kind of following on for something else

411
00:12:59,040 --> 00:12:59,680
you said is

412
00:12:59,680 --> 00:13:01,360
is you want to focus on where you're

413
00:13:01,360 --> 00:13:03,680
finding things so your time to detect

414
00:13:03,680 --> 00:13:05,360
becomes really powerful rather than the

415
00:13:05,360 --> 00:13:06,959
number of vulnerabilities

416
00:13:06,959 --> 00:13:09,120
um that being said you know you don't

417
00:13:09,120 --> 00:13:10,160
want teams to

418
00:13:10,160 --> 00:13:11,680
not report things because they don't

419
00:13:11,680 --> 00:13:13,680
want that to impact their metrics but at

420
00:13:13,680 --> 00:13:14,639
the same time

421
00:13:14,639 --> 00:13:16,720
for us as security teams it might be a

422
00:13:16,720 --> 00:13:18,480
metric that we track internally

423
00:13:18,480 --> 00:13:20,079
for me if i see that we've got no

424
00:13:20,079 --> 00:13:21,839
vulnerabilities that doesn't mean we're

425
00:13:21,839 --> 00:13:24,000
doing an amazing job it probably means

426
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:26,000
that something's not reporting correctly

427
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:28,000
um and equally if i see lots of

428
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:29,440
vulnerabilities in some areas i think

429
00:13:29,440 --> 00:13:31,200
lisa touched on this and not others it

430
00:13:31,200 --> 00:13:33,120
probably means that i need to look at

431
00:13:33,120 --> 00:13:34,480
is someone missing a stage in our

432
00:13:34,480 --> 00:13:36,560
pipeline that they shouldn't be

433
00:13:36,560 --> 00:13:38,320
um and is there is there a problem with

434
00:13:38,320 --> 00:13:40,560
code coverage or project coverage so i

435
00:13:40,560 --> 00:13:41,519
think

436
00:13:41,519 --> 00:13:43,680
i've certainly learned over my career so

437
00:13:43,680 --> 00:13:44,959
far that there's some metrics that i

438
00:13:44,959 --> 00:13:45,279
keep

439
00:13:45,279 --> 00:13:47,199
just for the security function to help

440
00:13:47,199 --> 00:13:49,199
us measure our impact in our coverage

441
00:13:49,199 --> 00:13:51,680
versus a metric that i might report

442
00:13:51,680 --> 00:13:52,560
further out

443
00:13:52,560 --> 00:13:55,120
things like time to detect time to fix

444
00:13:55,120 --> 00:13:55,760
versus

445
00:13:55,760 --> 00:13:58,800
number of vulnerabilities um

446
00:13:58,800 --> 00:13:59,920
interesting that's a good that's a i

447
00:13:59,920 --> 00:14:01,600
like that approach because then p you

448
00:14:01,600 --> 00:14:03,279
know people aren't gaming that in terms

449
00:14:03,279 --> 00:14:04,800
of oh we know we this is what we need to

450
00:14:04,800 --> 00:14:06,000
do to get that number down and that's

451
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:08,000
what we're interacting against so uh

452
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:10,639
interesting i like that um but um

453
00:14:10,639 --> 00:14:12,000
patrick one thing i'd love to ask you

454
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:12,639
actually is

455
00:14:12,639 --> 00:14:15,680
is less around the just the pure numbers

456
00:14:15,680 --> 00:14:16,000
point

457
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:17,600
of view from you know numbers of

458
00:14:17,600 --> 00:14:19,040
vulnerabilities those kind of things but

459
00:14:19,040 --> 00:14:20,639
more around the

460
00:14:20,639 --> 00:14:23,760
uh the team or organization level how

461
00:14:23,760 --> 00:14:27,040
how can you assess whether um your

462
00:14:27,040 --> 00:14:29,680
you know whether it's levels of um well

463
00:14:29,680 --> 00:14:30,560
i guess just

464
00:14:30,560 --> 00:14:33,839
how good a team is is um

465
00:14:33,839 --> 00:14:37,680
is running in terms of devsecops with

466
00:14:37,680 --> 00:14:41,120
a team a department an organization

467
00:14:41,120 --> 00:14:44,079
how do you measure that yeah again you

468
00:14:44,079 --> 00:14:45,519
probably look at like

469
00:14:45,519 --> 00:14:47,360
many different metrics and it's already

470
00:14:47,360 --> 00:14:48,560
been mentioned

471
00:14:48,560 --> 00:14:50,959
we could scan your code as an individual

472
00:14:50,959 --> 00:14:52,560
group and say you know we did really

473
00:14:52,560 --> 00:14:54,880
well and vulnerabilities what we found

474
00:14:54,880 --> 00:14:56,720
so we see some improvement like you're

475
00:14:56,720 --> 00:14:58,160
not doing cross-site scripting

476
00:14:58,160 --> 00:15:00,880
anymore so you're kind of improving on

477
00:15:00,880 --> 00:15:03,360
usually that is this security knowledge

478
00:15:03,360 --> 00:15:06,480
so the team is progressing on like the

479
00:15:06,480 --> 00:15:08,079
the errors and the mistakes or the

480
00:15:08,079 --> 00:15:10,160
issues they're they're getting

481
00:15:10,160 --> 00:15:13,360
um and then there's the other one is

482
00:15:13,360 --> 00:15:16,480
like imagine it occurs

483
00:15:16,480 --> 00:15:18,639
like how do they react to something will

484
00:15:18,639 --> 00:15:20,240
they just put it on the backlog

485
00:15:20,240 --> 00:15:22,639
they don't kind of focus on it they

486
00:15:22,639 --> 00:15:23,279
don't ask

487
00:15:23,279 --> 00:15:25,680
questions so that's kind of like how you

488
00:15:25,680 --> 00:15:26,480
know they really

489
00:15:26,480 --> 00:15:29,199
kind of care about this and then the

490
00:15:29,199 --> 00:15:30,160
third one i

491
00:15:30,160 --> 00:15:32,480
they i would measure on is how well they

492
00:15:32,480 --> 00:15:34,560
actually engage with the security team

493
00:15:34,560 --> 00:15:35,360
itself so

494
00:15:35,360 --> 00:15:37,759
you know they might be able to fix some

495
00:15:37,759 --> 00:15:39,759
stuff in the pipeline themselves reduce

496
00:15:39,759 --> 00:15:40,880
the number

497
00:15:40,880 --> 00:15:44,000
then they they kind of uh you know react

498
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:45,600
to issues in production

499
00:15:45,600 --> 00:15:47,600
and and when things happen you know that

500
00:15:47,600 --> 00:15:49,680
that's a good like posture they have

501
00:15:49,680 --> 00:15:51,440
but then the third one is actually like

502
00:15:51,440 --> 00:15:53,040
how well do they interact with the

503
00:15:53,040 --> 00:15:54,000
security focus

504
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:55,839
do they report issues do they ask

505
00:15:55,839 --> 00:15:58,160
questions do they kind of like

506
00:15:58,160 --> 00:16:00,560
talk to them when decisions are being

507
00:16:00,560 --> 00:16:01,680
made so

508
00:16:01,680 --> 00:16:03,519
that's kind of the you know the tree

509
00:16:03,519 --> 00:16:06,240
where i would look on

510
00:16:06,240 --> 00:16:08,720
for them to to be engaged as a team and

511
00:16:08,720 --> 00:16:10,480
how well they're doing devsecops uh

512
00:16:10,480 --> 00:16:14,320
as a team and much more contextual than

513
00:16:14,320 --> 00:16:15,440
just

514
00:16:15,440 --> 00:16:17,440
a set of numbers that are only you know

515
00:16:17,440 --> 00:16:18,639
only as uh

516
00:16:18,639 --> 00:16:20,480
accurate as the thought that went into

517
00:16:20,480 --> 00:16:21,759
into that which is kind of dangerous as

518
00:16:21,759 --> 00:16:22,079
well

519
00:16:22,079 --> 00:16:24,560
just being providing a number right you

520
00:16:24,560 --> 00:16:26,000
know there's this saying

521
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:28,959
um imagine you're at a party and you

522
00:16:28,959 --> 00:16:29,680
would number

523
00:16:29,680 --> 00:16:31,040
you would measure the number of

524
00:16:31,040 --> 00:16:33,759
interactions you have during a party

525
00:16:33,759 --> 00:16:36,240
right it doesn't tell you how good the

526
00:16:36,240 --> 00:16:37,600
party was so

527
00:16:37,600 --> 00:16:39,920
you can't really you know assess this by

528
00:16:39,920 --> 00:16:41,600
the number of touch points or or the

529
00:16:41,600 --> 00:16:42,639
number of you know

530
00:16:42,639 --> 00:16:45,279
things you fixed uh because you kind of

531
00:16:45,279 --> 00:16:46,079
need to have

532
00:16:46,079 --> 00:16:49,120
another kind of more higher

533
00:16:49,120 --> 00:16:51,680
uh abstraction and see how well this

534
00:16:51,680 --> 00:16:53,440
this fits into your company

535
00:16:53,440 --> 00:16:55,120
uh but obviously if you don't have the

536
00:16:55,120 --> 00:16:56,959
first thing if you're not talking to the

537
00:16:56,959 --> 00:16:58,000
people right it

538
00:16:58,000 --> 00:16:59,600
you know there's there's a step to be

539
00:16:59,600 --> 00:17:02,480
taken and i want to say this caveat like

540
00:17:02,480 --> 00:17:04,880
we often as you know we're deep in the

541
00:17:04,880 --> 00:17:05,520
field

542
00:17:05,520 --> 00:17:07,280
and we often already think about the

543
00:17:07,280 --> 00:17:09,520
exceptions yes but what if they don't do

544
00:17:09,520 --> 00:17:09,919
this

545
00:17:09,919 --> 00:17:11,839
so there's nothing wrong in getting the

546
00:17:11,839 --> 00:17:14,079
metrics up as we've said before

547
00:17:14,079 --> 00:17:16,240
but it's like the more you mature the

548
00:17:16,240 --> 00:17:18,880
more you understand the nuances

549
00:17:18,880 --> 00:17:20,959
uh of this and the same thing is

550
00:17:20,959 --> 00:17:22,959
happening in you know when a team adopts

551
00:17:22,959 --> 00:17:24,079
scrum

552
00:17:24,079 --> 00:17:25,760
right they're all about story points at

553
00:17:25,760 --> 00:17:27,039
the beginning and after a while you say

554
00:17:27,039 --> 00:17:28,240
like three points well

555
00:17:28,240 --> 00:17:30,080
you know that was just to get our boots

556
00:17:30,080 --> 00:17:31,600
trapped in our thinking

557
00:17:31,600 --> 00:17:33,360
how we we kind of deal with these

558
00:17:33,360 --> 00:17:35,280
situations and afterwards the story

559
00:17:35,280 --> 00:17:35,840
points get

560
00:17:35,840 --> 00:17:38,400
like you know way less important uh in

561
00:17:38,400 --> 00:17:39,840
the in the discussion so

562
00:17:39,840 --> 00:17:41,360
you know you need to have this bootstrap

563
00:17:41,360 --> 00:17:43,280
mentality and then you can kind of

564
00:17:43,280 --> 00:17:45,679
progress on the you know the more mature

565
00:17:45,679 --> 00:17:46,640
parts

566
00:17:46,640 --> 00:17:48,559
but you know the dew point on a team is

567
00:17:48,559 --> 00:17:50,320
don't assess them only on the technical

568
00:17:50,320 --> 00:17:51,039
point

569
00:17:51,039 --> 00:17:53,840
also look how they are in the process

570
00:17:53,840 --> 00:17:54,400
and then

571
00:17:54,400 --> 00:17:56,240
how they are on the collaboration side

572
00:17:56,240 --> 00:17:58,160
as well so

573
00:17:58,160 --> 00:17:59,679
how hard is that to scale because

574
00:17:59,679 --> 00:18:00,640
obviously everyone's going to have

575
00:18:00,640 --> 00:18:02,080
different opinions on those kind of

576
00:18:02,080 --> 00:18:04,320
things

577
00:18:04,400 --> 00:18:07,760
well it's it's interesting if you would

578
00:18:07,760 --> 00:18:08,160
treat

579
00:18:08,160 --> 00:18:10,559
all the teams uh the same they're you

580
00:18:10,559 --> 00:18:12,080
know it's probably

581
00:18:12,080 --> 00:18:15,520
gonna result in some average measurement

582
00:18:15,520 --> 00:18:20,240
um but most of the points were

583
00:18:20,240 --> 00:18:23,679
is almost like a satisfaction score uh

584
00:18:23,679 --> 00:18:27,039
for for people depending on the team or

585
00:18:27,039 --> 00:18:29,600
receiving information from the team uh

586
00:18:29,600 --> 00:18:30,480
and and that

587
00:18:30,480 --> 00:18:33,360
is you know i would weigh that in way

588
00:18:33,360 --> 00:18:34,640
more than i would like

589
00:18:34,640 --> 00:18:37,280
look at the technical kind of numbers

590
00:18:37,280 --> 00:18:38,559
but

591
00:18:38,559 --> 00:18:41,520
one gives the other interpretation uh as

592
00:18:41,520 --> 00:18:43,840
such

593
00:18:44,240 --> 00:18:45,679
by the way i can't can't believe i've

594
00:18:45,679 --> 00:18:47,679
been um measuring parties wrong all this

595
00:18:47,679 --> 00:18:49,120
time

596
00:18:49,120 --> 00:18:52,400
harsh ways to find out alyssa

597
00:18:52,400 --> 00:18:54,960
yeah so i was just kind of build on what

598
00:18:54,960 --> 00:18:56,559
patrick was saying

599
00:18:56,559 --> 00:18:58,480
that culture thing is so crucial right

600
00:18:58,480 --> 00:19:00,720
it's devops it's devsecops it it's all

601
00:19:00,720 --> 00:19:01,679
about culture

602
00:19:01,679 --> 00:19:05,360
and so bringing people together and

603
00:19:05,360 --> 00:19:07,440
you're breaking down silos so to speak

604
00:19:07,440 --> 00:19:08,720
or whatever although i'm

605
00:19:08,720 --> 00:19:11,440
not really a fan of that particular term

606
00:19:11,440 --> 00:19:12,640
um

607
00:19:12,640 --> 00:19:16,240
but yeah i think part of doing that is

608
00:19:16,240 --> 00:19:18,880
having kind of that visibility for the

609
00:19:18,880 --> 00:19:20,640
teams of what does that look like so we

610
00:19:20,640 --> 00:19:20,960
think

611
00:19:20,960 --> 00:19:23,200
bootstrapping early on and you know just

612
00:19:23,200 --> 00:19:24,720
just trying to get our feet wet in this

613
00:19:24,720 --> 00:19:26,240
and understanding okay

614
00:19:26,240 --> 00:19:27,679
here's kind of what we're targeting in

615
00:19:27,679 --> 00:19:29,919
that first kind of phase if you will or

616
00:19:29,919 --> 00:19:30,799
whatever

617
00:19:30,799 --> 00:19:31,919
um whether you want to call it a

618
00:19:31,919 --> 00:19:34,160
maturity level or

619
00:19:34,160 --> 00:19:36,640
you know certification criteria or

620
00:19:36,640 --> 00:19:37,520
whatever

621
00:19:37,520 --> 00:19:39,440
um and that what does it look like to

622
00:19:39,440 --> 00:19:40,640
get to that next level

623
00:19:40,640 --> 00:19:43,120
so this is how we operate today here's

624
00:19:43,120 --> 00:19:44,720
the things we need to change about what

625
00:19:44,720 --> 00:19:45,440
we're doing

626
00:19:45,440 --> 00:19:48,000
to get to that next level and then from

627
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:49,760
there what do we do to get to that next

628
00:19:49,760 --> 00:19:50,320
level

629
00:19:50,320 --> 00:19:53,600
and having kind of those those targets

630
00:19:53,600 --> 00:19:55,840
essentially that the teams can work

631
00:19:55,840 --> 00:19:56,880
toward

632
00:19:56,880 --> 00:19:58,559
and that way not only do you have

633
00:19:58,559 --> 00:20:00,240
something to measure against

634
00:20:00,240 --> 00:20:01,679
but you've really put that out there for

635
00:20:01,679 --> 00:20:03,600
the teams that they can start to see

636
00:20:03,600 --> 00:20:05,360
you know maybe there's something as

637
00:20:05,360 --> 00:20:06,799
they're working in their every day they

638
00:20:06,799 --> 00:20:08,400
say wow this is something we could add

639
00:20:08,400 --> 00:20:09,840
it's actually in our

640
00:20:09,840 --> 00:20:12,400
our silver criteria that you know to get

641
00:20:12,400 --> 00:20:14,240
to this silver level we got to be doing

642
00:20:14,240 --> 00:20:15,600
this so i'm going to pull that in and

643
00:20:15,600 --> 00:20:17,520
we're going to start doing that now

644
00:20:17,520 --> 00:20:20,080
um and so giving the teams that kind of

645
00:20:20,080 --> 00:20:21,360
just what is

646
00:20:21,360 --> 00:20:24,240
what does good look like helps build

647
00:20:24,240 --> 00:20:24,720
that

648
00:20:24,720 --> 00:20:27,039
that collaboration that culture because

649
00:20:27,039 --> 00:20:27,919
now

650
00:20:27,919 --> 00:20:30,000
now they see that yeah you know this

651
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:31,919
thing that maybe felt frivolous was

652
00:20:31,919 --> 00:20:33,200
actually something that

653
00:20:33,200 --> 00:20:34,720
we value as an organization it's going

654
00:20:34,720 --> 00:20:36,559
to be beneficial to our maturity in

655
00:20:36,559 --> 00:20:39,360
devsecops

656
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:42,480
yeah i i wanted to say that is one of

657
00:20:42,480 --> 00:20:44,559
the hard parts when you start because

658
00:20:44,559 --> 00:20:46,000
there's a million things you could do

659
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:47,760
like what first and and

660
00:20:47,760 --> 00:20:51,039
that is almost like paralyzing and i my

661
00:20:51,039 --> 00:20:52,000
advice is that

662
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:53,919
if it's so hard to choose what first

663
00:20:53,919 --> 00:20:55,200
just pick one right

664
00:20:55,200 --> 00:20:57,600
and start doing that and and and kind of

665
00:20:57,600 --> 00:20:59,280
see if you can make a dent or an

666
00:20:59,280 --> 00:21:00,400
improvement

667
00:21:00,400 --> 00:21:03,200
uh for that and then reevaluate your

668
00:21:03,200 --> 00:21:04,799
kind of what is important

669
00:21:04,799 --> 00:21:06,720
um and that's gonna be way better than

670
00:21:06,720 --> 00:21:08,960
making big plans up front to see you

671
00:21:08,960 --> 00:21:10,320
know we're gonna measure

672
00:21:10,320 --> 00:21:14,400
this over a long long period

673
00:21:14,400 --> 00:21:16,000
and i also want to touch on something

674
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:18,240
else like yes the tooling is

675
00:21:18,240 --> 00:21:21,280
is kind of you know sometimes

676
00:21:21,280 --> 00:21:23,200
say it's all about the culture but you

677
00:21:23,200 --> 00:21:24,480
kind of need the tooling

678
00:21:24,480 --> 00:21:27,520
and the culture because the culture the

679
00:21:27,520 --> 00:21:28,480
tooling often

680
00:21:28,480 --> 00:21:30,080
helps you like inventory you don't want

681
00:21:30,080 --> 00:21:31,520
to do this by hand

682
00:21:31,520 --> 00:21:33,360
or it creates this safety from a

683
00:21:33,360 --> 00:21:35,360
pipeline when you're doing the changes

684
00:21:35,360 --> 00:21:36,799
you don't have to check this all the

685
00:21:36,799 --> 00:21:40,000
time so both kind of go hand in hand

686
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:42,000
usually they level up on the technology

687
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:43,440
the level up on the process and

688
00:21:43,440 --> 00:21:45,919
it's kind of this gradual kind of uh

689
00:21:45,919 --> 00:21:47,440
level up but

690
00:21:47,440 --> 00:21:49,679
you know don't make a mistake and say

691
00:21:49,679 --> 00:21:51,600
like we don't need the tools

692
00:21:51,600 --> 00:21:53,679
but also don't make the mistake we only

693
00:21:53,679 --> 00:21:55,360
need to tools so it's kind of like

694
00:21:55,360 --> 00:21:57,360
somewhere in between there so

695
00:21:57,360 --> 00:21:59,280
patrick's touching on a pet peeve of

696
00:21:59,280 --> 00:22:00,880
mine which is when people measure their

697
00:22:00,880 --> 00:22:01,679
maturity

698
00:22:01,679 --> 00:22:04,880
just in capability or just in tools

699
00:22:04,880 --> 00:22:06,559
rather than doing everything together

700
00:22:06,559 --> 00:22:07,919
and thinking about

701
00:22:07,919 --> 00:22:09,520
what are your capabilities but what does

702
00:22:09,520 --> 00:22:10,880
your tool set look like and what is your

703
00:22:10,880 --> 00:22:13,039
culture look like as well

704
00:22:13,039 --> 00:22:15,760
yeah it's you need that one big picture

705
00:22:15,760 --> 00:22:16,799
um

706
00:22:16,799 --> 00:22:19,280
how do you find when when presenting

707
00:22:19,280 --> 00:22:20,320
that like

708
00:22:20,320 --> 00:22:22,720
how do you f how how do you find people

709
00:22:22,720 --> 00:22:24,720
want to hear that information obviously

710
00:22:24,720 --> 00:22:27,120
you know presenting up to to different

711
00:22:27,120 --> 00:22:28,240
groups that kind of

712
00:22:28,240 --> 00:22:29,679
one obviously keep it simple when i

713
00:22:29,679 --> 00:22:31,760
understand where their risk is do they

714
00:22:31,760 --> 00:22:34,880
do you find um that you've had

715
00:22:34,880 --> 00:22:37,440
different mileage in terms of uh what

716
00:22:37,440 --> 00:22:38,320
individuals

717
00:22:38,320 --> 00:22:40,960
want as data versus what you want to

718
00:22:40,960 --> 00:22:42,559
provide them to give them that

719
00:22:42,559 --> 00:22:45,840
well-rounded view of security

720
00:22:45,840 --> 00:22:48,480
yeah absolutely i think we all enter

721
00:22:48,480 --> 00:22:50,400
meetings like that with an idea of the

722
00:22:50,400 --> 00:22:51,840
story we want to tell

723
00:22:51,840 --> 00:22:53,200
and then as the audience the story you

724
00:22:53,200 --> 00:22:55,679
want to hear uh and certainly as you you

725
00:22:55,679 --> 00:22:57,280
think about your execs or your

726
00:22:57,280 --> 00:22:59,120
or even just your c team right there's a

727
00:22:59,120 --> 00:23:00,799
there's a story they want to hear

728
00:23:00,799 --> 00:23:03,520
and it's not always in line um when i've

729
00:23:03,520 --> 00:23:05,440
thought about how i've measured and

730
00:23:05,440 --> 00:23:07,039
and talked about our maturity in the

731
00:23:07,039 --> 00:23:09,280
past with different organizations

732
00:23:09,280 --> 00:23:11,120
i've always thought about um you know

733
00:23:11,120 --> 00:23:12,559
what what do i want to get out of this

734
00:23:12,559 --> 00:23:14,080
meeting and you know what do i want to

735
00:23:14,080 --> 00:23:15,039
leave with um

736
00:23:15,039 --> 00:23:16,080
what do i want to leave with what's the

737
00:23:16,080 --> 00:23:17,360
thing that i want to take away and so

738
00:23:17,360 --> 00:23:18,159
sometimes

739
00:23:18,159 --> 00:23:21,520
i have talked about my maturity to set

740
00:23:21,520 --> 00:23:22,720
expectations

741
00:23:22,720 --> 00:23:24,720
of hey we're a brand new function we're

742
00:23:24,720 --> 00:23:25,919
not going to be here

743
00:23:25,919 --> 00:23:27,679
in a week's time or a year's time and

744
00:23:27,679 --> 00:23:29,039
actually kind of setting that

745
00:23:29,039 --> 00:23:30,799
that story up for how we're going to

746
00:23:30,799 --> 00:23:32,320
flow through something

747
00:23:32,320 --> 00:23:34,159
other times i've used it to talk about

748
00:23:34,159 --> 00:23:35,360
budget

749
00:23:35,360 --> 00:23:37,360
and how you know certain amounts of

750
00:23:37,360 --> 00:23:39,039
budget will will ultimately release

751
00:23:39,039 --> 00:23:40,880
certain maturity levels right it's

752
00:23:40,880 --> 00:23:43,120
to a degree there's a pay-to-play model

753
00:23:43,120 --> 00:23:45,440
there from a maturity perspective

754
00:23:45,440 --> 00:23:47,120
uh and then and the most importantly

755
00:23:47,120 --> 00:23:48,960
i've talked about my prioritization

756
00:23:48,960 --> 00:23:51,360
so why i'm focusing on certain areas and

757
00:23:51,360 --> 00:23:53,120
especially for our execs i've been able

758
00:23:53,120 --> 00:23:54,559
to play back there

759
00:23:54,559 --> 00:23:56,320
here are our top risk levels and

760
00:23:56,320 --> 00:23:58,159
actually hear how they relate to my

761
00:23:58,159 --> 00:24:00,400
my maturity and those and and so this is

762
00:24:00,400 --> 00:24:02,159
how i'm gonna drive down risk in those

763
00:24:02,159 --> 00:24:03,679
areas so this is where i am today this

764
00:24:03,679 --> 00:24:04,000
is my

765
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:06,640
desired state and and this is ultimately

766
00:24:06,640 --> 00:24:08,159
the impact on risk and sometimes that

767
00:24:08,159 --> 00:24:09,840
also comes with police can i have some

768
00:24:09,840 --> 00:24:11,039
more money

769
00:24:11,039 --> 00:24:13,279
um not always but sometimes sometimes

770
00:24:13,279 --> 00:24:15,200
it's actually more about resource and

771
00:24:15,200 --> 00:24:17,200
about people championing your cause that

772
00:24:17,200 --> 00:24:18,880
culture piece certainly plays a lot into

773
00:24:18,880 --> 00:24:19,760
it but

774
00:24:19,760 --> 00:24:21,840
i think um there's no from what i've

775
00:24:21,840 --> 00:24:23,679
learned anyway and i'm sure

776
00:24:23,679 --> 00:24:25,360
people might have different different uh

777
00:24:25,360 --> 00:24:27,440
answers for this there isn't a one

778
00:24:27,440 --> 00:24:28,960
win for how you want to present your

779
00:24:28,960 --> 00:24:30,480
maturity model i think you really have

780
00:24:30,480 --> 00:24:31,679
to go in with

781
00:24:31,679 --> 00:24:33,360
what story do i want to tell but still

782
00:24:33,360 --> 00:24:35,039
be really cognizant of

783
00:24:35,039 --> 00:24:36,559
what do they need to hear from me to

784
00:24:36,559 --> 00:24:38,480
make whatever decision they need to make

785
00:24:38,480 --> 00:24:40,320
next as well

786
00:24:40,320 --> 00:24:42,559
and presumably i mean in terms of what

787
00:24:42,559 --> 00:24:45,600
risks there are of sharing that maturity

788
00:24:45,600 --> 00:24:46,080
um

789
00:24:46,080 --> 00:24:48,559
state of of either teams or the the

790
00:24:48,559 --> 00:24:50,080
whole organization

791
00:24:50,080 --> 00:24:52,159
um presumably there are benefits like

792
00:24:52,159 --> 00:24:53,600
you're able to back up the fact that you

793
00:24:53,600 --> 00:24:55,520
need maybe more budget or you need

794
00:24:55,520 --> 00:24:56,960
you know this is the state this is where

795
00:24:56,960 --> 00:24:58,559
we need to focus on it's like

796
00:24:58,559 --> 00:25:00,559
actual data that backs that up are there

797
00:25:00,559 --> 00:25:01,600
any risks

798
00:25:01,600 --> 00:25:03,600
that um that can also come with that

799
00:25:03,600 --> 00:25:05,760
when you provide that maturity data that

800
00:25:05,760 --> 00:25:07,520
maturity information

801
00:25:07,520 --> 00:25:10,159
for me for sure um like one might be hey

802
00:25:10,159 --> 00:25:11,760
i've not progressed in the way that i

803
00:25:11,760 --> 00:25:13,039
thought i would i've not hit my

804
00:25:13,039 --> 00:25:14,000
objectives in certain

805
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:16,240
areas again for me that comes down to

806
00:25:16,240 --> 00:25:17,760
actually throughout this year we've

807
00:25:17,760 --> 00:25:19,360
learned we've had to pivot we've you

808
00:25:19,360 --> 00:25:19,760
know

809
00:25:19,760 --> 00:25:21,440
our maybe our threat landscape has

810
00:25:21,440 --> 00:25:24,159
changed or our customer base has changed

811
00:25:24,159 --> 00:25:25,600
or our priorities as a company has

812
00:25:25,600 --> 00:25:26,720
changed and so

813
00:25:26,720 --> 00:25:29,039
my focus on on leveling up from a

814
00:25:29,039 --> 00:25:30,559
maturity perspective is actually being

815
00:25:30,559 --> 00:25:32,159
in these areas rather than

816
00:25:32,159 --> 00:25:35,679
than these um i have used it previously

817
00:25:35,679 --> 00:25:37,279
to say hey this is where we were

818
00:25:37,279 --> 00:25:39,039
and this is where we are now and hey

819
00:25:39,039 --> 00:25:40,720
look at my growth how wonderful is that

820
00:25:40,720 --> 00:25:41,039
but

821
00:25:41,039 --> 00:25:43,760
absolutely the downside is this is where

822
00:25:43,760 --> 00:25:44,240
i

823
00:25:44,240 --> 00:25:46,880
am and this is where i want to be um and

824
00:25:46,880 --> 00:25:48,320
actually maybe i haven't grown as much

825
00:25:48,320 --> 00:25:50,000
as i should have in some areas

826
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:53,600
um but i think it's it becomes a

827
00:25:53,600 --> 00:25:55,360
trust-based exercise too right

828
00:25:55,360 --> 00:25:57,039
what's your level of trust and comfort

829
00:25:57,039 --> 00:25:58,799
with your stakeholders and

830
00:25:58,799 --> 00:26:00,960
and you have to have that to be able to

831
00:26:00,960 --> 00:26:02,559
give an effective

832
00:26:02,559 --> 00:26:04,400
story right that helps them to

833
00:26:04,400 --> 00:26:06,080
contextualize to contextualize the

834
00:26:06,080 --> 00:26:07,520
decisions they want to make

835
00:26:07,520 --> 00:26:09,039
yeah it helps them kind of like

836
00:26:09,039 --> 00:26:11,360
understand the work that is

837
00:26:11,360 --> 00:26:12,720
you know happening in the org and things

838
00:26:12,720 --> 00:26:14,720
like that um patrick i'd love to i'd

839
00:26:14,720 --> 00:26:16,799
love to switch to kind of like

840
00:26:16,799 --> 00:26:18,559
from a maturity model point of view or

841
00:26:18,559 --> 00:26:20,240
or tracking maturity

842
00:26:20,240 --> 00:26:22,720
um how do companies that you know are

843
00:26:22,720 --> 00:26:24,559
obviously a little bit more advanced and

844
00:26:24,559 --> 00:26:26,080
able to be able to say look this is the

845
00:26:26,080 --> 00:26:27,760
this is the plan we already know we want

846
00:26:27,760 --> 00:26:28,720
to go through

847
00:26:28,720 --> 00:26:31,279
how do they how do companies keep track

848
00:26:31,279 --> 00:26:33,760
of that going going forward

849
00:26:33,760 --> 00:26:36,159
yeah i've seen many companies adapt one

850
00:26:36,159 --> 00:26:38,880
or more of the you know public

851
00:26:38,880 --> 00:26:41,039
uh models you know usually it's a

852
00:26:41,039 --> 00:26:43,200
maturity level one two five

853
00:26:43,200 --> 00:26:45,279
and they pick an area and they kind of

854
00:26:45,279 --> 00:26:46,799
say well you know we're doing the

855
00:26:46,799 --> 00:26:47,600
practices

856
00:26:47,600 --> 00:26:50,960
from this area and they're typically in

857
00:26:50,960 --> 00:26:54,159
you know level one or level two uh that

858
00:26:54,159 --> 00:26:55,760
gives you the visibility

859
00:26:55,760 --> 00:26:59,760
to where you think you are but

860
00:26:59,760 --> 00:27:02,559
it doesn't address what should be the

861
00:27:02,559 --> 00:27:04,000
next thing to work on so

862
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:07,120
that is usually uh much as we discussed

863
00:27:07,120 --> 00:27:07,760
earlier

864
00:27:07,760 --> 00:27:10,960
the metrics give you a view to discuss

865
00:27:10,960 --> 00:27:12,960
to create that share of you the same

866
00:27:12,960 --> 00:27:14,159
thing is happening with the

867
00:27:14,159 --> 00:27:16,080
maturity model is they they kind of have

868
00:27:16,080 --> 00:27:17,200
this overview

869
00:27:17,200 --> 00:27:19,039
of all the areas they they should be

870
00:27:19,039 --> 00:27:20,240
improving

871
00:27:20,240 --> 00:27:23,840
um then usually they kind of

872
00:27:23,840 --> 00:27:27,279
reach a common decision on where to

873
00:27:27,279 --> 00:27:31,039
go next which area to improve after

874
00:27:31,039 --> 00:27:34,000
you know considerations by the local

875
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:34,720
team

876
00:27:34,720 --> 00:27:38,240
by the company kind of goals and kind of

877
00:27:38,240 --> 00:27:40,640
try to align both of them to to kind of

878
00:27:40,640 --> 00:27:41,600
see if they're

879
00:27:41,600 --> 00:27:44,240
uh heading to the right direction and

880
00:27:44,240 --> 00:27:44,960
sometimes it

881
00:27:44,960 --> 00:27:47,039
it's also fine to say well you don't

882
00:27:47,039 --> 00:27:49,520
need to continue in that

883
00:27:49,520 --> 00:27:53,039
area because it's good enough for us so

884
00:27:53,039 --> 00:27:56,000
that is also like a balance to do that

885
00:27:56,000 --> 00:27:56,640
but

886
00:27:56,640 --> 00:27:59,679
creating that overview um is usually

887
00:27:59,679 --> 00:28:00,240
done by

888
00:28:00,240 --> 00:28:03,279
adopting an existing framework uh making

889
00:28:03,279 --> 00:28:05,520
a few kind of prioritizations that fit

890
00:28:05,520 --> 00:28:06,399
your

891
00:28:06,399 --> 00:28:08,960
current organization and then to have

892
00:28:08,960 --> 00:28:09,440
that like

893
00:28:09,440 --> 00:28:12,559
regular discussion like a review once a

894
00:28:12,559 --> 00:28:13,200
month

895
00:28:13,200 --> 00:28:15,279
uh kind of on the plans or when things

896
00:28:15,279 --> 00:28:16,559
are going

897
00:28:16,559 --> 00:28:19,760
i think the good ones are not just using

898
00:28:19,760 --> 00:28:20,240
this

899
00:28:20,240 --> 00:28:23,679
as an overview that says like

900
00:28:23,679 --> 00:28:26,320
oh when you only are one you should go

901
00:28:26,320 --> 00:28:28,080
to two but they are having that

902
00:28:28,080 --> 00:28:28,880
discussion

903
00:28:28,880 --> 00:28:30,799
what to do first and what not to do

904
00:28:30,799 --> 00:28:32,720
first together with the team

905
00:28:32,720 --> 00:28:34,399
because then you understand what the

906
00:28:34,399 --> 00:28:36,399
local issues are

907
00:28:36,399 --> 00:28:39,360
and then they try to help and suggest

908
00:28:39,360 --> 00:28:40,240
that team

909
00:28:40,240 --> 00:28:42,799
rather than force the team to have to

910
00:28:42,799 --> 00:28:43,679
take something on

911
00:28:43,679 --> 00:28:45,279
i'm not saying you you know there's

912
00:28:45,279 --> 00:28:47,200
sometimes is a need to force things when

913
00:28:47,200 --> 00:28:47,520
when

914
00:28:47,520 --> 00:28:50,559
things are at risk but the good ones

915
00:28:50,559 --> 00:28:52,240
then take this model

916
00:28:52,240 --> 00:28:54,799
they show it they discuss it and then

917
00:28:54,799 --> 00:28:56,880
they work on the motivation

918
00:28:56,880 --> 00:28:59,679
of the teams to do it less than

919
00:28:59,679 --> 00:29:01,440
imperatively saying

920
00:29:01,440 --> 00:29:04,000
this is what you should do next so it's

921
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:04,799
kind of uh

922
00:29:04,799 --> 00:29:06,480
you know how they they deal with these

923
00:29:06,480 --> 00:29:07,919
situations and then

924
00:29:07,919 --> 00:29:10,480
slowly by providing the information on

925
00:29:10,480 --> 00:29:12,559
why you think it's a guided id that

926
00:29:12,559 --> 00:29:14,880
should improve a certain area due to

927
00:29:14,880 --> 00:29:16,399
numerous reasons

928
00:29:16,399 --> 00:29:19,200
um you kind of like hope you transfer

929
00:29:19,200 --> 00:29:20,320
that to the team

930
00:29:20,320 --> 00:29:23,760
taking action on this that kind of

931
00:29:23,760 --> 00:29:25,200
sounds like it's

932
00:29:25,200 --> 00:29:27,440
easier said than done like with when you

933
00:29:27,440 --> 00:29:29,279
have like so many teams that need that

934
00:29:29,279 --> 00:29:31,120
involvement whether it's execs

935
00:29:31,120 --> 00:29:32,480
trying to pressure on something whether

936
00:29:32,480 --> 00:29:34,240
it's the security team saying so we

937
00:29:34,240 --> 00:29:35,200
totally need this

938
00:29:35,200 --> 00:29:38,799
you have kids right i do yes try to

939
00:29:38,799 --> 00:29:41,279
tell them what to do first to try to

940
00:29:41,279 --> 00:29:43,200
motivate them to do something well but

941
00:29:43,200 --> 00:29:44,159
yeah but this is

942
00:29:44,159 --> 00:29:46,000
okay now that's that's interesting so

943
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:48,080
it's it's one thing motivating them to

944
00:29:48,080 --> 00:29:48,480
do it

945
00:29:48,480 --> 00:29:49,919
if i was to ask my kids what do you want

946
00:29:49,919 --> 00:29:51,360
to do i know what they'd want to do and

947
00:29:51,360 --> 00:29:52,240
i know it's not good for them

948
00:29:52,240 --> 00:29:53,279
necessarily right

949
00:29:53,279 --> 00:29:55,840
so it's not necessarily always just ask

950
00:29:55,840 --> 00:29:56,960
the development team and see what they

951
00:29:56,960 --> 00:29:57,919
want to do right it's

952
00:29:57,919 --> 00:30:00,000
it's that coaching or that that

953
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:01,039
discussion

954
00:30:01,039 --> 00:30:02,799
you know input from the business input

955
00:30:02,799 --> 00:30:04,159
from the security team input to the

956
00:30:04,159 --> 00:30:05,039
development team

957
00:30:05,039 --> 00:30:07,360
how is it common to straight away come

958
00:30:07,360 --> 00:30:08,559
out with one

959
00:30:08,559 --> 00:30:11,039
uh plan that everyone's happy with or is

960
00:30:11,039 --> 00:30:12,960
it very much just a case of you know

961
00:30:12,960 --> 00:30:14,000
all right you do that bit because that's

962
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:15,360
what you want to do then the next bit is

963
00:30:15,360 --> 00:30:16,799
what we want to do which is this

964
00:30:16,799 --> 00:30:20,000
how does that pull together

965
00:30:21,520 --> 00:30:24,559
oh you want me to answer yeah no please

966
00:30:24,559 --> 00:30:27,520
sure well yeah it is give and take right

967
00:30:27,520 --> 00:30:28,559
um but but

968
00:30:28,559 --> 00:30:31,760
but that is if if a team would start

969
00:30:31,760 --> 00:30:33,279
working on something you

970
00:30:33,279 --> 00:30:35,200
got to give them somehow a reason and

971
00:30:35,200 --> 00:30:37,520
and that that kind of

972
00:30:37,520 --> 00:30:40,159
perspective can go in in many directions

973
00:30:40,159 --> 00:30:41,120
the motivation

974
00:30:41,120 --> 00:30:42,559
could be appealing to their

975
00:30:42,559 --> 00:30:45,679
professionalism sometimes that works

976
00:30:45,679 --> 00:30:47,279
and they need to see this as part of

977
00:30:47,279 --> 00:30:50,080
their job for others it is

978
00:30:50,080 --> 00:30:52,399
you know can we close this ticket as

979
00:30:52,399 --> 00:30:53,919
fast as possible

980
00:30:53,919 --> 00:30:56,640
uh but but you know there are all

981
00:30:56,640 --> 00:30:57,760
motivations that

982
00:30:57,760 --> 00:30:59,760
that help people to to do some security

983
00:30:59,760 --> 00:31:01,840
work uh but

984
00:31:01,840 --> 00:31:04,240
maybe they need some building block for

985
00:31:04,240 --> 00:31:06,240
another team to build on so

986
00:31:06,240 --> 00:31:08,320
that is not different than selling

987
00:31:08,320 --> 00:31:09,519
anything right

988
00:31:09,519 --> 00:31:12,159
you need to give something in return

989
00:31:12,159 --> 00:31:14,080
before you start asking them to do

990
00:31:14,080 --> 00:31:14,960
something

991
00:31:14,960 --> 00:31:17,440
uh in and that how that works that's

992
00:31:17,440 --> 00:31:18,399
probably going to be

993
00:31:18,399 --> 00:31:20,080
independent like what makes them tick

994
00:31:20,080 --> 00:31:22,240
and how they fit in the organization

995
00:31:22,240 --> 00:31:25,120
uh to make them you know do their job

996
00:31:25,120 --> 00:31:26,480
there so

997
00:31:26,480 --> 00:31:30,000
okay we've gone quite deep now into

998
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:32,000
what an advanced company kind of does

999
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:34,240
and we started out talking about what uh

1000
00:31:34,240 --> 00:31:36,000
what a company does who's new to

1001
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:38,000
devsecops um

1002
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:40,399
alyssa in terms of how we what you know

1003
00:31:40,399 --> 00:31:42,559
what the the differences are between

1004
00:31:42,559 --> 00:31:44,640
trying to address the how we measure

1005
00:31:44,640 --> 00:31:46,880
question with these advanced

1006
00:31:46,880 --> 00:31:49,279
groups versus a group that's just coming

1007
00:31:49,279 --> 00:31:51,679
in is there one model that we use or is

1008
00:31:51,679 --> 00:31:54,480
it vastly different

1009
00:31:54,480 --> 00:31:57,760
it i mean it definitely varies uh from

1010
00:31:57,760 --> 00:32:00,159
organization organization so in that way

1011
00:32:00,159 --> 00:32:02,720
um you know and and i think what you see

1012
00:32:02,720 --> 00:32:03,440
is uh

1013
00:32:03,440 --> 00:32:05,600
in young organizations it's kind of

1014
00:32:05,600 --> 00:32:07,519
standard fare right i mean again

1015
00:32:07,519 --> 00:32:08,720
they all kind of like we're going to

1016
00:32:08,720 --> 00:32:10,720
measure you know number of

1017
00:32:10,720 --> 00:32:12,480
vulnerabilities we're going to measure

1018
00:32:12,480 --> 00:32:14,640
these these very simple tactical things

1019
00:32:14,640 --> 00:32:16,240
because they're just the easy numbers to

1020
00:32:16,240 --> 00:32:17,919
collect

1021
00:32:17,919 --> 00:32:19,919
where you start to really see it diverge

1022
00:32:19,919 --> 00:32:22,159
is as those organizations mature because

1023
00:32:22,159 --> 00:32:23,840
now they start to see okay what is a

1024
00:32:23,840 --> 00:32:25,279
value to us

1025
00:32:25,279 --> 00:32:27,600
you know if i'm gonna go before my you

1026
00:32:27,600 --> 00:32:29,039
know executive committee or i'm going to

1027
00:32:29,039 --> 00:32:30,880
go to the board and i'm going to present

1028
00:32:30,880 --> 00:32:34,080
on security one of the dangers in doing

1029
00:32:34,080 --> 00:32:34,480
that

1030
00:32:34,480 --> 00:32:36,320
ever when you put together that

1031
00:32:36,320 --> 00:32:37,679
presentation is going in there and

1032
00:32:37,679 --> 00:32:38,880
saying here's all the bad things that

1033
00:32:38,880 --> 00:32:39,760
are going on

1034
00:32:39,760 --> 00:32:41,840
right because you know speaking to the

1035
00:32:41,840 --> 00:32:43,120
motivation that patrick was talking

1036
00:32:43,120 --> 00:32:43,600
about

1037
00:32:43,600 --> 00:32:45,840
nothing is more demotivating and nothing

1038
00:32:45,840 --> 00:32:47,360
is more sure to tune

1039
00:32:47,360 --> 00:32:49,679
your executives out of what it is you're

1040
00:32:49,679 --> 00:32:51,760
trying to get them to do

1041
00:32:51,760 --> 00:32:53,279
then to give them all the doom and gloom

1042
00:32:53,279 --> 00:32:55,440
without you know any kind of

1043
00:32:55,440 --> 00:32:58,480
you know horizon or hey here's here's

1044
00:32:58,480 --> 00:33:00,559
what we're seeing that we can build upon

1045
00:33:00,559 --> 00:33:01,919
you know that and that's what that's how

1046
00:33:01,919 --> 00:33:04,480
you kind of build that motivation so as

1047
00:33:04,480 --> 00:33:06,480
organizations mature they start to look

1048
00:33:06,480 --> 00:33:08,000
for instead of just

1049
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:10,799
okay let's measure risk let's look at

1050
00:33:10,799 --> 00:33:12,960
what security is doing

1051
00:33:12,960 --> 00:33:16,320
in terms of our overall product goals

1052
00:33:16,320 --> 00:33:19,519
right and this is where i sit down with

1053
00:33:19,519 --> 00:33:22,720
uh executives and it it's hey

1054
00:33:22,720 --> 00:33:25,840
you need to be building a

1055
00:33:25,840 --> 00:33:28,640
a value model here for security how is

1056
00:33:28,640 --> 00:33:30,399
security making your pipeline

1057
00:33:30,399 --> 00:33:32,880
faster so we've heard these terms like

1058
00:33:32,880 --> 00:33:34,399
you know paving the road and things like

1059
00:33:34,399 --> 00:33:34,880
that well

1060
00:33:34,880 --> 00:33:37,840
how is the secure path become the one

1061
00:33:37,840 --> 00:33:39,679
that is the easiest path for our devs to

1062
00:33:39,679 --> 00:33:41,760
follow and as a result security is

1063
00:33:41,760 --> 00:33:42,880
driving

1064
00:33:42,880 --> 00:33:45,440
you know uh more deploys per day or

1065
00:33:45,440 --> 00:33:46,320
whatever

1066
00:33:46,320 --> 00:33:49,120
and i know i say that and the developers

1067
00:33:49,120 --> 00:33:50,480
out there are immediately like what are

1068
00:33:50,480 --> 00:33:52,320
you talking about security never makes

1069
00:33:52,320 --> 00:33:54,960
us faster security always slows us down

1070
00:33:54,960 --> 00:33:56,960
it doesn't have to be that way and i've

1071
00:33:56,960 --> 00:33:58,559
i've definitely worked in

1072
00:33:58,559 --> 00:34:00,159
with different organizations where i've

1073
00:34:00,159 --> 00:34:02,799
seen how you know bringing say you know

1074
00:34:02,799 --> 00:34:04,559
threat modeling into the user story

1075
00:34:04,559 --> 00:34:06,240
level and having it that information

1076
00:34:06,240 --> 00:34:07,840
available through the pipeline

1077
00:34:07,840 --> 00:34:11,040
actually speeds up the pipeline and so

1078
00:34:11,040 --> 00:34:13,599
that becomes the other piece then again

1079
00:34:13,599 --> 00:34:15,520
i kind of alluded to this before it

1080
00:34:15,520 --> 00:34:16,560
becomes less about

1081
00:34:16,560 --> 00:34:19,599
measuring security in that just

1082
00:34:19,599 --> 00:34:21,679
here's security it becomes how is

1083
00:34:21,679 --> 00:34:24,639
security fitting into the pipeline

1084
00:34:24,639 --> 00:34:27,918
how is security actually enabling

1085
00:34:27,918 --> 00:34:31,119
say you know again more deploys per day

1086
00:34:31,119 --> 00:34:34,000
or whatever whatever's meaning to

1087
00:34:34,000 --> 00:34:35,199
meaningful to you

1088
00:34:35,199 --> 00:34:37,520
from the product perspective from the

1089
00:34:37,520 --> 00:34:39,359
business perspective

1090
00:34:39,359 --> 00:34:41,679
measuring security in context of those

1091
00:34:41,679 --> 00:34:42,639
elements

1092
00:34:42,639 --> 00:34:45,199
that's the sign of a organization that's

1093
00:34:45,199 --> 00:34:47,199
really maturing in this journey

1094
00:34:47,199 --> 00:34:50,079
yeah cool and can you believe we're

1095
00:34:50,079 --> 00:34:52,239
already 35 minutes in so i want to ask

1096
00:34:52,239 --> 00:34:53,679
one final question

1097
00:34:53,679 --> 00:34:55,839
which is to end uh with you know in and

1098
00:34:55,839 --> 00:34:57,200
around maturity which is an important

1099
00:34:57,200 --> 00:34:59,520
one because we've talked about

1100
00:34:59,520 --> 00:35:03,359
you know how we can track maturity how

1101
00:35:03,359 --> 00:35:04,160
we can

1102
00:35:04,160 --> 00:35:07,200
um you know assess maturity i guess with

1103
00:35:07,200 --> 00:35:09,040
some of the larger organizations and

1104
00:35:09,040 --> 00:35:10,800
things like that but when we think about

1105
00:35:10,800 --> 00:35:12,320
how we actually carry out that

1106
00:35:12,320 --> 00:35:13,040
assessment

1107
00:35:13,040 --> 00:35:16,640
um tash for example a self-assessment

1108
00:35:16,640 --> 00:35:17,839
maybe from developers

1109
00:35:17,839 --> 00:35:20,880
or a assessment that uh we would want

1110
00:35:20,880 --> 00:35:22,880
the security team to do for all groups

1111
00:35:22,880 --> 00:35:24,480
how do we actually go about rolling out

1112
00:35:24,480 --> 00:35:25,920
that kind of assessment to an

1113
00:35:25,920 --> 00:35:27,680
organization

1114
00:35:27,680 --> 00:35:29,520
well hey self-reflection is always a

1115
00:35:29,520 --> 00:35:31,119
great thing so

1116
00:35:31,119 --> 00:35:32,560
we're always going to start with there's

1117
00:35:32,560 --> 00:35:34,720
a a period of self-reflection to really

1118
00:35:34,720 --> 00:35:35,359
feel

1119
00:35:35,359 --> 00:35:36,640
like you can be honest with yourself

1120
00:35:36,640 --> 00:35:38,560
around where you stand is is great

1121
00:35:38,560 --> 00:35:40,800
but it is subjective right we're always

1122
00:35:40,800 --> 00:35:42,560
going to see the best in ourselves or

1123
00:35:42,560 --> 00:35:44,800
we're going to see one point of a story

1124
00:35:44,800 --> 00:35:46,960
i think um context is king here it

1125
00:35:46,960 --> 00:35:48,079
depends what you're measuring your

1126
00:35:48,079 --> 00:35:50,400
maturity for is it to really understand

1127
00:35:50,400 --> 00:35:52,240
for personal growth of your security

1128
00:35:52,240 --> 00:35:54,480
program and your engineering function

1129
00:35:54,480 --> 00:35:58,000
or is this for a thing is it for an

1130
00:35:58,000 --> 00:36:00,160
auditor is it for your board is it for a

1131
00:36:00,160 --> 00:36:02,240
measurement i think that helps

1132
00:36:02,240 --> 00:36:04,560
and so i would always suggest starting

1133
00:36:04,560 --> 00:36:05,359
with that

1134
00:36:05,359 --> 00:36:06,640
self-assessment having those

1135
00:36:06,640 --> 00:36:08,000
conversations with your engineering team

1136
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:09,920
but let it be securely team-led so you

1137
00:36:09,920 --> 00:36:12,320
can bring a little bit of objectivity

1138
00:36:12,320 --> 00:36:13,920
and then depending on what story you

1139
00:36:13,920 --> 00:36:16,880
want to tell or how this is being used

1140
00:36:16,880 --> 00:36:19,440
use a third party i think having someone

1141
00:36:19,440 --> 00:36:20,640
who sits whether that's

1142
00:36:20,640 --> 00:36:23,040
outside your company or together or even

1143
00:36:23,040 --> 00:36:24,640
someone from a product perspective i

1144
00:36:24,640 --> 00:36:25,920
think it's really important that this i

1145
00:36:25,920 --> 00:36:27,280
mentioned product

1146
00:36:27,280 --> 00:36:28,640
that's what we're all here for right

1147
00:36:28,640 --> 00:36:30,880
that's why we have jobs it's to it's to

1148
00:36:30,880 --> 00:36:32,800
build a product to release features to

1149
00:36:32,800 --> 00:36:34,320
our customer base

1150
00:36:34,320 --> 00:36:36,240
and so having someone who can be credit

1151
00:36:36,240 --> 00:36:38,160
focus you can help

1152
00:36:38,160 --> 00:36:40,160
navigate the conversation to get back to

1153
00:36:40,160 --> 00:36:42,160
your goal that maturity goal

1154
00:36:42,160 --> 00:36:44,480
and start to carry out those interviews

1155
00:36:44,480 --> 00:36:46,240
with you how are you on patch management

1156
00:36:46,240 --> 00:36:47,760
on change management

1157
00:36:47,760 --> 00:36:50,079
those types of things um can bring a

1158
00:36:50,079 --> 00:36:52,079
level of objectivity to it

1159
00:36:52,079 --> 00:36:53,920
and but i wouldn't rule out having a

1160
00:36:53,920 --> 00:36:55,359
phil parry there's plenty of companies

1161
00:36:55,359 --> 00:36:56,960
out there that will use many established

1162
00:36:56,960 --> 00:36:58,480
frameworks to measure you

1163
00:36:58,480 --> 00:37:00,160
um but i'd always start on that

1164
00:37:00,160 --> 00:37:02,079
self-assessment even if it's just for

1165
00:37:02,079 --> 00:37:03,839
that period of reflection

1166
00:37:03,839 --> 00:37:05,920
to really be honest with yourself often

1167
00:37:05,920 --> 00:37:08,320
i found um patrick spoke about

1168
00:37:08,320 --> 00:37:10,640
motivation rather than asking people

1169
00:37:10,640 --> 00:37:11,920
what they want to do

1170
00:37:11,920 --> 00:37:14,000
i found personally they're asking people

1171
00:37:14,000 --> 00:37:15,599
to really reflect on where they think

1172
00:37:15,599 --> 00:37:17,839
they are in that one to five model

1173
00:37:17,839 --> 00:37:19,280
i'm making sure they're clear i'm not

1174
00:37:19,280 --> 00:37:20,720
expecting them or wanting them to be at

1175
00:37:20,720 --> 00:37:22,000
a five

1176
00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:24,079
can drive a level of motivation that you

1177
00:37:24,079 --> 00:37:25,839
wouldn't get if you went straight to

1178
00:37:25,839 --> 00:37:28,720
their party assessment yeah i think also

1179
00:37:28,720 --> 00:37:30,560
that transparency is really key about

1180
00:37:30,560 --> 00:37:32,720
why you're doing it so that if you

1181
00:37:32,720 --> 00:37:34,079
you know you don't want this it to

1182
00:37:34,079 --> 00:37:35,280
necessarily turn into something

1183
00:37:35,280 --> 00:37:36,880
defensive from the development teams you

1184
00:37:36,880 --> 00:37:39,040
want it to kind of like be very much

1185
00:37:39,040 --> 00:37:40,800
we want to do this to improve so we can

1186
00:37:40,800 --> 00:37:42,560
understand how we can develop fast or

1187
00:37:42,560 --> 00:37:43,520
how we can you know

1188
00:37:43,520 --> 00:37:46,160
so that it's of value to them and then

1189
00:37:46,160 --> 00:37:47,680
they can kind of be more honest i love

1190
00:37:47,680 --> 00:37:49,280
that i love that approach

1191
00:37:49,280 --> 00:37:53,280
um do you think tash that what works

1192
00:37:53,280 --> 00:37:54,560
you mean you mentioned third party

1193
00:37:54,560 --> 00:37:56,320
assessors almost do you feel that

1194
00:37:56,320 --> 00:37:57,760
there's almost like this cookie cutter

1195
00:37:57,760 --> 00:37:58,560
approach that

1196
00:37:58,560 --> 00:38:00,800
what works in one organization can you

1197
00:38:00,800 --> 00:38:02,160
know you can just move to another t

1198
00:38:02,160 --> 00:38:04,079
move to another company and say hey i'm

1199
00:38:04,079 --> 00:38:05,760
going to use this exact same

1200
00:38:05,760 --> 00:38:07,520
maturity assessment and it should just

1201
00:38:07,520 --> 00:38:09,200
work or do you feel like there's some

1202
00:38:09,200 --> 00:38:10,480
customization

1203
00:38:10,480 --> 00:38:12,400
that needs to happen for your for your

1204
00:38:12,400 --> 00:38:14,079
orgs

1205
00:38:14,079 --> 00:38:15,839
i've definitely seen the cookie cutter

1206
00:38:15,839 --> 00:38:17,440
approach i think a lot of auditing

1207
00:38:17,440 --> 00:38:18,560
companies

1208
00:38:18,560 --> 00:38:20,960
certainly do that without the context of

1209
00:38:20,960 --> 00:38:23,200
what your threat landscape is what your

1210
00:38:23,200 --> 00:38:25,599
risk level is what data you hold or what

1211
00:38:25,599 --> 00:38:26,560
value

1212
00:38:26,560 --> 00:38:28,320
you look after from a security

1213
00:38:28,320 --> 00:38:30,960
perspective um but there are companies

1214
00:38:30,960 --> 00:38:32,720
out there who will contextualize

1215
00:38:32,720 --> 00:38:34,800
who will look at your risk landscape and

1216
00:38:34,800 --> 00:38:37,040
make sure your controls are appropriate

1217
00:38:37,040 --> 00:38:38,560
i think it's important

1218
00:38:38,560 --> 00:38:40,000
to recognize that a good sign of

1219
00:38:40,000 --> 00:38:41,839
maturity is a company that looks at

1220
00:38:41,839 --> 00:38:43,520
appropriate controls

1221
00:38:43,520 --> 00:38:44,960
for their threat landscape not

1222
00:38:44,960 --> 00:38:47,119
necessarily the um

1223
00:38:47,119 --> 00:38:49,119
full fledge of everything they can do

1224
00:38:49,119 --> 00:38:51,359
irresponsible spending for me is a lack

1225
00:38:51,359 --> 00:38:53,359
of maturity right just throwing money at

1226
00:38:53,359 --> 00:38:55,119
a problem or focusing on tools

1227
00:38:55,119 --> 00:38:58,000
there's a lack of maturity and so a good

1228
00:38:58,000 --> 00:38:59,599
third party will look at that

1229
00:38:59,599 --> 00:39:01,440
contextualization of what's your

1230
00:39:01,440 --> 00:39:02,960
what you're trying to protect what's

1231
00:39:02,960 --> 00:39:04,880
your risk landscape

1232
00:39:04,880 --> 00:39:06,160
not necessarily what your budget is

1233
00:39:06,160 --> 00:39:07,599
because sometimes that unfortunately

1234
00:39:07,599 --> 00:39:09,040
doesn't line up

1235
00:39:09,040 --> 00:39:11,680
and and using that to really build that

1236
00:39:11,680 --> 00:39:12,800
maturity model

1237
00:39:12,800 --> 00:39:16,000
uh for both uh where you are right now

1238
00:39:16,000 --> 00:39:17,599
where you should be and then also

1239
00:39:17,599 --> 00:39:18,640
helping you to understand where the

1240
00:39:18,640 --> 00:39:19,839
industry is now i think

1241
00:39:19,839 --> 00:39:21,760
the industry tends to be a little bit

1242
00:39:21,760 --> 00:39:23,680
below where we should be trending

1243
00:39:23,680 --> 00:39:25,760
um but it's important that you know if

1244
00:39:25,760 --> 00:39:27,599
you are a small business

1245
00:39:27,599 --> 00:39:30,160
focused on a um i don't know a sas

1246
00:39:30,160 --> 00:39:31,440
service that you're not comparing

1247
00:39:31,440 --> 00:39:33,520
yourself to financial services

1248
00:39:33,520 --> 00:39:35,839
but equally you're holding a high bar

1249
00:39:35,839 --> 00:39:36,720
for you and your

1250
00:39:36,720 --> 00:39:39,520
your company and your customers awesome

1251
00:39:39,520 --> 00:39:41,359
well we're eating into the break a tiny

1252
00:39:41,359 --> 00:39:42,960
little bit but i do want to just eat a

1253
00:39:42,960 --> 00:39:44,640
tiny bit more into that break

1254
00:39:44,640 --> 00:39:46,640
time uh dev set con i just want to ask

1255
00:39:46,640 --> 00:39:48,640
one very very quick question of each of

1256
00:39:48,640 --> 00:39:49,760
you the same question

1257
00:39:49,760 --> 00:39:52,720
uh what is your one golden tip on

1258
00:39:52,720 --> 00:39:53,440
measuring

1259
00:39:53,440 --> 00:39:56,240
devsecop's maturity and i'll i'll ask uh

1260
00:39:56,240 --> 00:39:58,240
tash first then listen i'll be horrible

1261
00:39:58,240 --> 00:39:59,839
to to patrick who goes third

1262
00:39:59,839 --> 00:40:01,839
and might need to reuse an answer but

1263
00:40:01,839 --> 00:40:03,760
tash what is your one golden tip for

1264
00:40:03,760 --> 00:40:05,920
measuring depths of cop security

1265
00:40:05,920 --> 00:40:07,680
i will go back to me i said earlier

1266
00:40:07,680 --> 00:40:09,760
which is what story do you want to tell

1267
00:40:09,760 --> 00:40:10,960
and what behaviours

1268
00:40:10,960 --> 00:40:13,119
behaviors do you want to encourage your

1269
00:40:13,119 --> 00:40:14,480
metrics should underpin

1270
00:40:14,480 --> 00:40:15,839
those behaviors that you want to

1271
00:40:15,839 --> 00:40:17,760
encourage great advice

1272
00:40:17,760 --> 00:40:20,800
love it and alyssa don't let security

1273
00:40:20,800 --> 00:40:21,920
off the hook

1274
00:40:21,920 --> 00:40:24,000
remember that the idea of shared

1275
00:40:24,000 --> 00:40:25,520
responsibility doesn't just mean

1276
00:40:25,520 --> 00:40:27,200
everybody's responsible for security it

1277
00:40:27,200 --> 00:40:28,960
means security is responsible for making

1278
00:40:28,960 --> 00:40:31,119
sure that software gets out quickly and

1279
00:40:31,119 --> 00:40:33,920
with stability your sres are responsible

1280
00:40:33,920 --> 00:40:35,839
for security and making sure that things

1281
00:40:35,839 --> 00:40:37,280
deploy quickly

1282
00:40:37,280 --> 00:40:38,800
remember that's what shared

1283
00:40:38,800 --> 00:40:41,280
responsibility is actually all about

1284
00:40:41,280 --> 00:40:44,800
awesome and finally patrick

1285
00:40:44,800 --> 00:40:48,640
so i would say think about

1286
00:40:48,640 --> 00:40:51,520
when security department doesn't exist

1287
00:40:51,520 --> 00:40:52,560
anymore

1288
00:40:52,560 --> 00:40:54,560
would people still be doing the right

1289
00:40:54,560 --> 00:40:55,760
thing

1290
00:40:55,760 --> 00:40:57,520
oh my goodness when does the security

1291
00:40:57,520 --> 00:40:59,760
team go away patrick

1292
00:40:59,760 --> 00:41:02,319
well no no no more comments let's just

1293
00:41:02,319 --> 00:41:03,599
end on that

1294
00:41:03,599 --> 00:41:06,319
bombshell so thank you very much uh to

1295
00:41:06,319 --> 00:41:06,800
tash

1296
00:41:06,800 --> 00:41:09,040
alyssa and patrick sorry to leave you on

1297
00:41:09,040 --> 00:41:10,800
such a terrible news there

1298
00:41:10,800 --> 00:41:13,200
but we wish what a wonderful discussion

1299
00:41:13,200 --> 00:41:14,400
that was thank you all for

1300
00:41:14,400 --> 00:41:16,079
for a great discussion and have a

1301
00:41:16,079 --> 00:41:21,839
wonderful rest of devsecond24

1302
00:41:22,800 --> 00:41:24,880
