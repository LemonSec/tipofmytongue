2
00:00:12,080 --> 00:00:14,080
hello everyone i'm guybo thanks for

3
00:00:14,080 --> 00:00:15,679
tuning in to uh to my talk here at

4
00:00:15,679 --> 00:00:17,279
devsicon i'm really excited to be here

5
00:00:17,279 --> 00:00:18,080
and i'm going to be

6
00:00:18,080 --> 00:00:20,240
digging into modern security and cloud

7
00:00:20,240 --> 00:00:21,119
native appsec

8
00:00:21,119 --> 00:00:25,199
in a bit so hope you enjoy the talk

9
00:00:25,199 --> 00:00:28,080
so today we're going to talk about cloud

10
00:00:28,080 --> 00:00:28,640
native

11
00:00:28,640 --> 00:00:31,840
application security and it's a big

12
00:00:31,840 --> 00:00:33,520
term and there's all sorts of ways in

13
00:00:33,520 --> 00:00:35,440
which we talk about modernizing security

14
00:00:35,440 --> 00:00:35,680
and

15
00:00:35,680 --> 00:00:38,239
uh and such at devsicon but really what

16
00:00:38,239 --> 00:00:39,520
i'm trying to do here is i'll try to

17
00:00:39,520 --> 00:00:40,079
give you

18
00:00:40,079 --> 00:00:42,879
slightly big picture mental model and

19
00:00:42,879 --> 00:00:44,000
maybe iterate some key

20
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:46,000
principles that we can all take kind of

21
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:47,360
on the journeys as we

22
00:00:47,360 --> 00:00:49,760
as we evolve security and application

23
00:00:49,760 --> 00:00:50,559
security

24
00:00:50,559 --> 00:00:52,800
uh maybe into sort of this new reality

25
00:00:52,800 --> 00:00:53,760
um just

26
00:00:53,760 --> 00:00:55,680
a couple of words about me you know i am

27
00:00:55,680 --> 00:00:58,079
the founder and president of sneak

28
00:00:58,079 --> 00:00:59,440
which you're probably familiar with and

29
00:00:59,440 --> 00:01:01,920
i also host the secure developer podcast

30
00:01:01,920 --> 00:01:03,199
where i get a chance to talk to all

31
00:01:03,199 --> 00:01:04,959
sorts of smart security leaders

32
00:01:04,959 --> 00:01:07,920
uh that are you know hopeful oftentimes

33
00:01:07,920 --> 00:01:09,600
leading the charge

34
00:01:09,600 --> 00:01:11,600
around this type of practices so i

35
00:01:11,600 --> 00:01:12,880
learned from kind of both of those

36
00:01:12,880 --> 00:01:13,840
journeys

37
00:01:13,840 --> 00:01:15,360
and i've actually recently written a

38
00:01:15,360 --> 00:01:17,280
book with o'reilly on this notion of

39
00:01:17,280 --> 00:01:18,560
cloud native appsec and

40
00:01:18,560 --> 00:01:20,159
you can get a free copy of it you have

41
00:01:20,159 --> 00:01:22,080
the link over there and

42
00:01:22,080 --> 00:01:23,360
hopefully you know that kind of goes

43
00:01:23,360 --> 00:01:25,280
into deeper detail of what i'll talk

44
00:01:25,280 --> 00:01:27,840
about today

45
00:01:27,840 --> 00:01:30,320
so let's dig in talk a little bit about

46
00:01:30,320 --> 00:01:31,759
the flow here

47
00:01:31,759 --> 00:01:33,680
we're going to talk first about kind of

48
00:01:33,680 --> 00:01:35,680
setting the stage about the context of

49
00:01:35,680 --> 00:01:37,360
digital transformation

50
00:01:37,360 --> 00:01:39,680
and and really mostly again around key

51
00:01:39,680 --> 00:01:41,119
principles that we can take along

52
00:01:41,119 --> 00:01:43,280
the journey when we think about adapting

53
00:01:43,280 --> 00:01:44,399
security to it

54
00:01:44,399 --> 00:01:46,240
we'll dig into dev for security and how

55
00:01:46,240 --> 00:01:47,600
that's not just a different way of

56
00:01:47,600 --> 00:01:48,799
saying shift left

57
00:01:48,799 --> 00:01:50,560
we'll talk about cloud native apps and

58
00:01:50,560 --> 00:01:52,159
how do we secure their entire scope and

59
00:01:52,159 --> 00:01:52,880
then we'll dig

60
00:01:52,880 --> 00:01:55,600
into some of the transformation itself

61
00:01:55,600 --> 00:01:57,200
so how do we adapt what do we need to

62
00:01:57,200 --> 00:01:57,840
change

63
00:01:57,840 --> 00:01:59,520
to deal with it so this is just sort of

64
00:01:59,520 --> 00:02:00,799
a 30 minute talk so we're not going to

65
00:02:00,799 --> 00:02:01,119
go

66
00:02:01,119 --> 00:02:03,040
heavily deep into each of those but

67
00:02:03,040 --> 00:02:04,320
again we'll hopefully give

68
00:02:04,320 --> 00:02:07,600
a bit of a mental model and some

69
00:02:07,600 --> 00:02:09,919
you know concrete examples of sort of

70
00:02:09,919 --> 00:02:11,360
principles that you can try to follow as

71
00:02:11,360 --> 00:02:12,480
you go along

72
00:02:12,480 --> 00:02:15,520
so diving in let's start with digital

73
00:02:15,520 --> 00:02:16,319
transformation

74
00:02:16,319 --> 00:02:18,879
and adapting to it so digital

75
00:02:18,879 --> 00:02:20,160
transformation is a big

76
00:02:20,160 --> 00:02:23,360
buzzword you know it's a it's it means

77
00:02:23,360 --> 00:02:25,280
different things to to different people

78
00:02:25,280 --> 00:02:27,040
uh but i think we'll all agree that it's

79
00:02:27,040 --> 00:02:29,120
that it's real you know it is

80
00:02:29,120 --> 00:02:31,760
a force that is happening right now in

81
00:02:31,760 --> 00:02:33,599
the world of technology in the world of

82
00:02:33,599 --> 00:02:34,400
business

83
00:02:34,400 --> 00:02:36,640
uh and and that's the reason you hear

84
00:02:36,640 --> 00:02:38,239
digital translation

85
00:02:38,239 --> 00:02:41,200
so often it's because it's a it's a it's

86
00:02:41,200 --> 00:02:41,760
a very

87
00:02:41,760 --> 00:02:44,000
real and immediate need and focus area

88
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:45,519
for a lot of businesses

89
00:02:45,519 --> 00:02:47,200
and i'll talk about sort of three

90
00:02:47,200 --> 00:02:49,519
aspects of digital transformation and

91
00:02:49,519 --> 00:02:52,720
and how they relate to security

92
00:02:52,720 --> 00:02:55,920
the first one is that everyone wants to

93
00:02:55,920 --> 00:02:56,160
be

94
00:02:56,160 --> 00:02:59,040
a technology company uh and if you work

95
00:02:59,040 --> 00:03:00,400
for a technology company

96
00:03:00,400 --> 00:03:01,760
already you know for a software company

97
00:03:01,760 --> 00:03:03,440
for a sas company you think digital

98
00:03:03,440 --> 00:03:04,319
transformation

99
00:03:04,319 --> 00:03:07,519
you probably are primarily focused on

100
00:03:07,519 --> 00:03:08,959
the next two elements about devops

101
00:03:08,959 --> 00:03:11,519
around cloud but in many companies in

102
00:03:11,519 --> 00:03:13,440
the banks and the retailers

103
00:03:13,440 --> 00:03:15,440
and really many many different types of

104
00:03:15,440 --> 00:03:17,360
organizations it's around

105
00:03:17,360 --> 00:03:21,440
shifting from a business that was

106
00:03:21,440 --> 00:03:24,080
primarily analog was primarily in person

107
00:03:24,080 --> 00:03:25,360
or physical research

108
00:03:25,360 --> 00:03:27,519
into companies that really position

109
00:03:27,519 --> 00:03:28,799
themselves to be

110
00:03:28,799 --> 00:03:31,200
a digital company that does x a digital

111
00:03:31,200 --> 00:03:32,159
company that does

112
00:03:32,159 --> 00:03:34,159
banking a digital company that sells

113
00:03:34,159 --> 00:03:35,840
clothes et cetera

114
00:03:35,840 --> 00:03:39,200
and that's a significant shift it brings

115
00:03:39,200 --> 00:03:40,000
with it all

116
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:41,519
sort of technology investments and

117
00:03:41,519 --> 00:03:43,280
platform and how you build software

118
00:03:43,280 --> 00:03:46,640
but predominantly it changes the center

119
00:03:46,640 --> 00:03:48,319
of gravity maybe the weight

120
00:03:48,319 --> 00:03:50,159
that the company wants to give into

121
00:03:50,159 --> 00:03:52,480
their technology operations as compared

122
00:03:52,480 --> 00:03:53,120
to others

123
00:03:53,120 --> 00:03:55,280
and with it the center of gravity that

124
00:03:55,280 --> 00:03:56,640
the security

125
00:03:56,640 --> 00:04:00,159
aspect of that sort of digital footprint

126
00:04:00,159 --> 00:04:02,239
should have in comparison to the rest of

127
00:04:02,239 --> 00:04:03,200
the organization

128
00:04:03,200 --> 00:04:05,360
and and kind of the practices that that

129
00:04:05,360 --> 00:04:06,799
involves

130
00:04:06,799 --> 00:04:08,959
from a from a security transformation

131
00:04:08,959 --> 00:04:09,840
perspective

132
00:04:09,840 --> 00:04:11,760
what that really means is that as we go

133
00:04:11,760 --> 00:04:12,799
through this and we talk about

134
00:04:12,799 --> 00:04:14,080
principles we talk about

135
00:04:14,080 --> 00:04:15,760
dev for security and modern and cloud

136
00:04:15,760 --> 00:04:17,759
native appsec there's oftentimes a

137
00:04:17,759 --> 00:04:19,600
tendency to say hey yeah that's for the

138
00:04:19,600 --> 00:04:20,478
sort of the

139
00:04:20,478 --> 00:04:23,040
small and nimble smb company that is

140
00:04:23,040 --> 00:04:24,160
kind of running along

141
00:04:24,160 --> 00:04:26,240
and moving fast it doesn't really work

142
00:04:26,240 --> 00:04:27,440
for my kind of big

143
00:04:27,440 --> 00:04:29,680
conglomerate fortune you know 100

144
00:04:29,680 --> 00:04:32,160
company and the reality is that it must

145
00:04:32,160 --> 00:04:34,400
because digital transformation is trying

146
00:04:34,400 --> 00:04:35,199
to get

147
00:04:35,199 --> 00:04:38,240
all companies to operate to a degree as

148
00:04:38,240 --> 00:04:39,600
a technology company as

149
00:04:39,600 --> 00:04:41,520
a modern company and so as we go through

150
00:04:41,520 --> 00:04:42,720
these

151
00:04:42,720 --> 00:04:45,280
remember that they might seem modern and

152
00:04:45,280 --> 00:04:46,639
fast and nimble but really

153
00:04:46,639 --> 00:04:48,240
even the largest organizations are

154
00:04:48,240 --> 00:04:51,919
striving to work in this fashion

155
00:04:52,160 --> 00:04:54,720
the second tip is around devops and

156
00:04:54,720 --> 00:04:56,240
again devops you can write

157
00:04:56,240 --> 00:04:57,759
full dissertations on to know what

158
00:04:57,759 --> 00:04:59,440
devops is but

159
00:04:59,440 --> 00:05:02,080
fundamentally the model of devops is

160
00:05:02,080 --> 00:05:02,639
around

161
00:05:02,639 --> 00:05:05,120
revolves around independent teams it's

162
00:05:05,120 --> 00:05:05,919
really around

163
00:05:05,919 --> 00:05:08,720
a small set of people who are able to

164
00:05:08,720 --> 00:05:10,000
you know catch the ball in one side of

165
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:11,440
the court run all the way to the other

166
00:05:11,440 --> 00:05:13,199
side score and do that again

167
00:05:13,199 --> 00:05:15,280
and again and again and the tighter that

168
00:05:15,280 --> 00:05:17,600
loop the faster that iteration

169
00:05:17,600 --> 00:05:20,320
the better the business does and and

170
00:05:20,320 --> 00:05:21,919
that's important because

171
00:05:21,919 --> 00:05:24,080
when we think about security we should

172
00:05:24,080 --> 00:05:25,280
use that as a

173
00:05:25,280 --> 00:05:28,639
as a guiding factor we should assess any

174
00:05:28,639 --> 00:05:31,280
solution that we try to devise for

175
00:05:31,280 --> 00:05:32,880
security

176
00:05:32,880 --> 00:05:35,600
on its ability uh to sort of fit this

177
00:05:35,600 --> 00:05:37,600
model to have application teams that are

178
00:05:37,600 --> 00:05:38,000
building

179
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:40,479
it be able to apply that security model

180
00:05:40,479 --> 00:05:42,639
that security process that security tool

181
00:05:42,639 --> 00:05:45,280
independently and really fundamentally

182
00:05:45,280 --> 00:05:46,479
if they cannot

183
00:05:46,479 --> 00:05:48,720
it won't work it would go against the

184
00:05:48,720 --> 00:05:50,000
grain of every

185
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:51,600
company wanting to be a technology

186
00:05:51,600 --> 00:05:54,000
company this is especially important for

187
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:55,840
security which has a natural tendency of

188
00:05:55,840 --> 00:05:57,600
being much more centralized

189
00:05:57,600 --> 00:05:59,039
and so thinking about it in this

190
00:05:59,039 --> 00:06:01,120
independent teams model

191
00:06:01,120 --> 00:06:03,440
is something that is a great significant

192
00:06:03,440 --> 00:06:04,840
principle to keep in mind as you

193
00:06:04,840 --> 00:06:07,120
transform

194
00:06:07,120 --> 00:06:09,840
and then the third element of digital

195
00:06:09,840 --> 00:06:11,120
transformation i'll highlight is the

196
00:06:11,120 --> 00:06:12,240
notion of cloud

197
00:06:12,240 --> 00:06:14,560
and you know again worlds can be said

198
00:06:14,560 --> 00:06:15,600
but fundamentally

199
00:06:15,600 --> 00:06:17,759
cloud changes the scope of the

200
00:06:17,759 --> 00:06:18,639
application

201
00:06:18,639 --> 00:06:20,720
in the pre-cloud era an app was mostly

202
00:06:20,720 --> 00:06:22,479
some code and some libraries

203
00:06:22,479 --> 00:06:24,000
and they were sitting on top of a big

204
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:25,919
central i.t stack

205
00:06:25,919 --> 00:06:27,680
that was centrally managed and provided

206
00:06:27,680 --> 00:06:29,440
databases and servers and networks and

207
00:06:29,440 --> 00:06:30,560
data centers

208
00:06:30,560 --> 00:06:32,319
in cloud these things have not just

209
00:06:32,319 --> 00:06:34,000
become virtual they've become

210
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:37,199
apis and they are invoked

211
00:06:37,199 --> 00:06:39,199
and managed through the repository

212
00:06:39,199 --> 00:06:41,280
they're they're sort of naturally a part

213
00:06:41,280 --> 00:06:43,280
of the software development process

214
00:06:43,280 --> 00:06:45,360
they're they are stored in some repo

215
00:06:45,360 --> 00:06:47,199
they're applied through a build

216
00:06:47,199 --> 00:06:49,919
and so they they've become a part of the

217
00:06:49,919 --> 00:06:52,639
app or rather the app has grown in scope

218
00:06:52,639 --> 00:06:56,080
to encompass these at these aspects

219
00:06:56,080 --> 00:06:58,639
and so when we think about this for

220
00:06:58,639 --> 00:06:59,360
security

221
00:06:59,360 --> 00:07:01,039
and for application security it means we

222
00:07:01,039 --> 00:07:03,360
need to expand the scope of application

223
00:07:03,360 --> 00:07:04,080
security

224
00:07:04,080 --> 00:07:06,160
because all the security concerns all

225
00:07:06,160 --> 00:07:08,319
the decisions that these it people

226
00:07:08,319 --> 00:07:09,759
were making about that sort of central

227
00:07:09,759 --> 00:07:11,360
stack to try and avoid

228
00:07:11,360 --> 00:07:14,000
unpatched servers trying to avoid a

229
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:15,680
misconfigured infrastructure all of

230
00:07:15,680 --> 00:07:16,160
those

231
00:07:16,160 --> 00:07:18,000
have moved to become apis and those

232
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:19,199
decisions are not being made

233
00:07:19,199 --> 00:07:21,440
by developers as part of their kind of

234
00:07:21,440 --> 00:07:23,759
repository and the files in there

235
00:07:23,759 --> 00:07:25,520
and so we need to shift and we need to

236
00:07:25,520 --> 00:07:27,360
think about application security in a

237
00:07:27,360 --> 00:07:28,479
broader scope

238
00:07:28,479 --> 00:07:31,520
that now encompasses these sort of full

239
00:07:31,520 --> 00:07:33,840
stack

240
00:07:34,080 --> 00:07:36,560
so fundamentally all of those combine

241
00:07:36,560 --> 00:07:38,720
into a need for a new approach to

242
00:07:38,720 --> 00:07:40,160
application security it's still

243
00:07:40,160 --> 00:07:41,440
application security we're still

244
00:07:41,440 --> 00:07:43,120
securing the app that's what we're doing

245
00:07:43,120 --> 00:07:43,759
here

246
00:07:43,759 --> 00:07:46,639
but we need to grow the scope to be

247
00:07:46,639 --> 00:07:47,520
cloud native

248
00:07:47,520 --> 00:07:49,599
application security to include the full

249
00:07:49,599 --> 00:07:51,199
scope of cloud native apps

250
00:07:51,199 --> 00:07:53,360
and we need to make it dev first to be

251
00:07:53,360 --> 00:07:54,319
able to adapt

252
00:07:54,319 --> 00:07:56,840
to this sort of independent team

253
00:07:56,840 --> 00:07:58,080
approach

254
00:07:58,080 --> 00:08:00,160
so what does this mean let's let's dig

255
00:08:00,160 --> 00:08:01,120
into

256
00:08:01,120 --> 00:08:02,960
two of those elements the dev first and

257
00:08:02,960 --> 00:08:04,639
the cloud native start with dev

258
00:08:04,639 --> 00:08:06,720
first so what's what's the difference

259
00:08:06,720 --> 00:08:07,919
you know what's

260
00:08:07,919 --> 00:08:11,120
uh the the meaning of applying security

261
00:08:11,120 --> 00:08:12,240
and defer session

262
00:08:12,240 --> 00:08:15,280
versus not before i dig into sort of

263
00:08:15,280 --> 00:08:16,479
specific examples

264
00:08:16,479 --> 00:08:18,879
what i would say is the the the secret

265
00:08:18,879 --> 00:08:19,520
is in the name

266
00:08:19,520 --> 00:08:21,360
you know developer first security

267
00:08:21,360 --> 00:08:23,919
implies that you should start by asking

268
00:08:23,919 --> 00:08:26,080
if i am a developer and i want to tackle

269
00:08:26,080 --> 00:08:27,280
a security risk

270
00:08:27,280 --> 00:08:30,400
what is the optimal solution for me

271
00:08:30,400 --> 00:08:31,840
forget everything else forget all the

272
00:08:31,840 --> 00:08:33,519
other needs forget your own need if

273
00:08:33,519 --> 00:08:34,799
you're you know if you're a security

274
00:08:34,799 --> 00:08:35,919
person your own needs

275
00:08:35,919 --> 00:08:39,360
and just say what is the most important

276
00:08:39,360 --> 00:08:40,080
you know what's the

277
00:08:40,080 --> 00:08:41,519
what are sort of the attributes that are

278
00:08:41,519 --> 00:08:42,719
most important the solution for a

279
00:08:42,719 --> 00:08:44,320
developer to be successful and then

280
00:08:44,320 --> 00:08:45,839
build from there that's the meaning of

281
00:08:45,839 --> 00:08:46,399
developer

282
00:08:46,399 --> 00:08:48,720
first you first start with the

283
00:08:48,720 --> 00:08:50,399
developers needs

284
00:08:50,399 --> 00:08:52,640
so with that general philosophy let me

285
00:08:52,640 --> 00:08:54,720
give you maybe three concrete

286
00:08:54,720 --> 00:08:58,640
tips that that we can try to apply here

287
00:08:58,640 --> 00:09:02,000
first is what does a developer know and

288
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:02,640
what does an

289
00:09:02,640 --> 00:09:04,640
auditor know so kind of this this

290
00:09:04,640 --> 00:09:06,880
context of developer versus auditor

291
00:09:06,880 --> 00:09:08,959
and at a high level developers

292
00:09:08,959 --> 00:09:11,040
understand the app they know the app

293
00:09:11,040 --> 00:09:12,959
far better than the auditor does they

294
00:09:12,959 --> 00:09:14,399
leave and breathe the app they've built

295
00:09:14,399 --> 00:09:15,760
parts of the app they understand the

296
00:09:15,760 --> 00:09:16,959
functionality

297
00:09:16,959 --> 00:09:19,040
while an auditor they understand the

298
00:09:19,040 --> 00:09:20,800
risk they've seen this attack they've

299
00:09:20,800 --> 00:09:22,480
seen this vulnerability many a time they

300
00:09:22,480 --> 00:09:23,279
understand

301
00:09:23,279 --> 00:09:25,360
what can happen with it and that's

302
00:09:25,360 --> 00:09:26,399
that's the context

303
00:09:26,399 --> 00:09:28,720
that's the world in which they approach

304
00:09:28,720 --> 00:09:30,560
the same bit of information or they

305
00:09:30,560 --> 00:09:32,160
judge the same bit of information

306
00:09:32,160 --> 00:09:34,720
through and the other way to think about

307
00:09:34,720 --> 00:09:36,640
it is with that knowledge when they zoom

308
00:09:36,640 --> 00:09:37,200
out

309
00:09:37,200 --> 00:09:39,040
they see different things when a

310
00:09:39,040 --> 00:09:40,320
developer zooms out

311
00:09:40,320 --> 00:09:42,399
you know they have a security aspect of

312
00:09:42,399 --> 00:09:44,720
their application and they zoom out

313
00:09:44,720 --> 00:09:47,200
they see the application they see you

314
00:09:47,200 --> 00:09:48,560
know the application with all its glory

315
00:09:48,560 --> 00:09:50,240
oh it's moving parts all of its

316
00:09:50,240 --> 00:09:52,000
performance issues all of its resilience

317
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:53,519
issues all of its quality bugs

318
00:09:53,519 --> 00:09:55,279
that's what they see they understand it

319
00:09:55,279 --> 00:09:56,880
and that's the lens through which they

320
00:09:56,880 --> 00:09:58,480
see the security problem as another

321
00:09:58,480 --> 00:09:59,200
aspect

322
00:09:59,200 --> 00:10:01,760
of of the application well for an

323
00:10:01,760 --> 00:10:03,600
auditor when they zoom out they see the

324
00:10:03,600 --> 00:10:04,000
whole

325
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:07,120
risk for this app they see all the bad

326
00:10:07,120 --> 00:10:08,800
things all the assets can be stolen

327
00:10:08,800 --> 00:10:11,040
but actually more often they they don't

328
00:10:11,040 --> 00:10:12,399
really think about just the app

329
00:10:12,399 --> 00:10:13,680
because most auditors are not just

330
00:10:13,680 --> 00:10:14,959
looking at one app they're looking

331
00:10:14,959 --> 00:10:16,240
across a portfolio

332
00:10:16,240 --> 00:10:18,560
and so what they see is they see the

333
00:10:18,560 --> 00:10:19,920
same risk the same

334
00:10:19,920 --> 00:10:21,519
across that scripting or the same known

335
00:10:21,519 --> 00:10:24,480
vulnerability across apps

336
00:10:24,480 --> 00:10:26,480
and this lens is very very important you

337
00:10:26,480 --> 00:10:27,760
know when you look at

338
00:10:27,760 --> 00:10:29,680
security solutions today they heavily

339
00:10:29,680 --> 00:10:32,160
heavily bias in favor of the auditor

340
00:10:32,160 --> 00:10:34,160
product they tend to default

341
00:10:34,160 --> 00:10:36,640
to showing your vulnerability amidst a

342
00:10:36,640 --> 00:10:38,800
list of vulnerabilities that's the zoom

343
00:10:38,800 --> 00:10:40,240
out it's all the vulnerabilities from

344
00:10:40,240 --> 00:10:41,120
all the apps

345
00:10:41,120 --> 00:10:43,760
now you can kind of drill into them they

346
00:10:43,760 --> 00:10:45,680
they tend to just

347
00:10:45,680 --> 00:10:47,360
emphasize you know in terms of the

348
00:10:47,360 --> 00:10:49,440
elements of the information provided

349
00:10:49,440 --> 00:10:52,720
the um the the risk that that

350
00:10:52,720 --> 00:10:55,040
that that um vulnerability or that sort

351
00:10:55,040 --> 00:10:56,399
of security defect

352
00:10:56,399 --> 00:10:59,040
represents well for a developer those

353
00:10:59,040 --> 00:11:00,720
are are fine they might you know cope

354
00:11:00,720 --> 00:11:01,360
with this

355
00:11:01,360 --> 00:11:03,040
but that's not their primary lens their

356
00:11:03,040 --> 00:11:04,720
primary lens really is

357
00:11:04,720 --> 00:11:07,440
the uh is the application itself so what

358
00:11:07,440 --> 00:11:08,800
they're seeking

359
00:11:08,800 --> 00:11:11,200
is when they want more context is how

360
00:11:11,200 --> 00:11:12,959
does this vulnerability

361
00:11:12,959 --> 00:11:15,040
relates to my application where does it

362
00:11:15,040 --> 00:11:16,880
sit in my application

363
00:11:16,880 --> 00:11:18,720
and they might bias more towards you

364
00:11:18,720 --> 00:11:20,800
know trees of libraries you sort of use

365
00:11:20,800 --> 00:11:22,480
this library to use that other library

366
00:11:22,480 --> 00:11:24,160
which is that other library

367
00:11:24,160 --> 00:11:26,079
that last one is vulnerable great now i

368
00:11:26,079 --> 00:11:28,160
know how it got into my system

369
00:11:28,160 --> 00:11:29,680
and you know there are many examples of

370
00:11:29,680 --> 00:11:31,360
it so when you think about developer

371
00:11:31,360 --> 00:11:32,240
first security

372
00:11:32,240 --> 00:11:35,360
you want to present solutions in a way

373
00:11:35,360 --> 00:11:35,920
that

374
00:11:35,920 --> 00:11:38,480
first and foremost highlights the place

375
00:11:38,480 --> 00:11:39,120
of that

376
00:11:39,120 --> 00:11:43,680
security issue within the application

377
00:11:43,680 --> 00:11:45,200
the second you know this might come as a

378
00:11:45,200 --> 00:11:46,880
surprise is that

379
00:11:46,880 --> 00:11:49,680
developers like developer tools um the

380
00:11:49,680 --> 00:11:50,959
generally

381
00:11:50,959 --> 00:11:52,720
your security solution my security

382
00:11:52,720 --> 00:11:54,240
solution and secure solution it's not

383
00:11:54,240 --> 00:11:55,519
the only thing that the developer is

384
00:11:55,519 --> 00:11:56,639
using in fact

385
00:11:56,639 --> 00:11:59,120
far from it they are using a myriad of

386
00:11:59,120 --> 00:12:01,440
tools dozens sometimes you know more

387
00:12:01,440 --> 00:12:04,000
schools in in their daily lives and

388
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:05,920
those tools have an affinity they work

389
00:12:05,920 --> 00:12:07,920
in a certain way they are built

390
00:12:07,920 --> 00:12:10,639
in a in a whole methodology around being

391
00:12:10,639 --> 00:12:12,320
self-serve and easy to use they have

392
00:12:12,320 --> 00:12:13,360
certain ux

393
00:12:13,360 --> 00:12:15,120
they do that sort of application context

394
00:12:15,120 --> 00:12:16,639
we talked about before

395
00:12:16,639 --> 00:12:19,279
uh they adhere to some common guidelines

396
00:12:19,279 --> 00:12:19,839
around

397
00:12:19,839 --> 00:12:21,200
uh around kind of the developer

398
00:12:21,200 --> 00:12:23,600
experience the dx versus ux

399
00:12:23,600 --> 00:12:26,880
or as an aspect of ux and and on top of

400
00:12:26,880 --> 00:12:27,680
all of those they

401
00:12:27,680 --> 00:12:30,240
they relate to one another you know they

402
00:12:30,240 --> 00:12:31,120
they talk about

403
00:12:31,120 --> 00:12:34,639
context like a lamp stack or uh or many

404
00:12:34,639 --> 00:12:35,519
others

405
00:12:35,519 --> 00:12:38,320
and so when you think about your

406
00:12:38,320 --> 00:12:39,839
solution and you think about a developer

407
00:12:39,839 --> 00:12:40,639
first approach

408
00:12:40,639 --> 00:12:41,760
and again it doesn't really matter if

409
00:12:41,760 --> 00:12:43,440
it's a homegrown solution or or

410
00:12:43,440 --> 00:12:46,000
something commercial or anything else

411
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:48,399
you want to walk and talk and crack like

412
00:12:48,399 --> 00:12:50,560
a developer tool you want to

413
00:12:50,560 --> 00:12:54,000
model your solution on other solutions

414
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:55,519
that the developers might be using

415
00:12:55,519 --> 00:12:58,959
and that in turn would make it natural

416
00:12:58,959 --> 00:13:00,880
for a developer to use it if you are

417
00:13:00,880 --> 00:13:02,639
building it if you're modeling it like

418
00:13:02,639 --> 00:13:04,320
the vast majority of security solutions

419
00:13:04,320 --> 00:13:04,880
out there

420
00:13:04,880 --> 00:13:07,680
on an auditing tool and you just try to

421
00:13:07,680 --> 00:13:09,360
shift it left to kind of you know plop

422
00:13:09,360 --> 00:13:11,120
it into the pipeline or into a repo or

423
00:13:11,120 --> 00:13:12,480
ide

424
00:13:12,480 --> 00:13:13,920
it's not going to feel natural for

425
00:13:13,920 --> 00:13:15,680
developers now what i have here is a bit

426
00:13:15,680 --> 00:13:17,200
of a visual which is

427
00:13:17,200 --> 00:13:18,560
everything i describe right now sounds

428
00:13:18,560 --> 00:13:20,480
like i'm referring to the

429
00:13:20,480 --> 00:13:23,519
the um just the product itself the tech

430
00:13:23,519 --> 00:13:24,160
the the

431
00:13:24,160 --> 00:13:26,240
uh ux of the product but in practice

432
00:13:26,240 --> 00:13:27,600
when you think about developer tools you

433
00:13:27,600 --> 00:13:28,720
should think holistically

434
00:13:28,720 --> 00:13:30,800
especially if you're building a solution

435
00:13:30,800 --> 00:13:33,040
for a security solution for developers

436
00:13:33,040 --> 00:13:34,639
you have to think about the go to market

437
00:13:34,639 --> 00:13:36,560
developers like to

438
00:13:36,560 --> 00:13:38,720
use before they buy they like to start

439
00:13:38,720 --> 00:13:40,320
self-serve and then when they see

440
00:13:40,320 --> 00:13:42,639
success they like to grow and scale that

441
00:13:42,639 --> 00:13:44,560
while security solutions tend to be much

442
00:13:44,560 --> 00:13:47,199
more sort of top-down you know find some

443
00:13:47,199 --> 00:13:48,000
buyer and then

444
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:50,639
roll it out across it developers like to

445
00:13:50,639 --> 00:13:51,920
start small and

446
00:13:51,920 --> 00:13:53,760
and tried and then with proven success

447
00:13:53,760 --> 00:13:55,600
grow well security solutions tend to

448
00:13:55,600 --> 00:13:57,279
start in a centralized fashion and roll

449
00:13:57,279 --> 00:13:58,000
it out

450
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:00,160
and so if you want developers to embrace

451
00:14:00,160 --> 00:14:02,160
your solution whether it's developers in

452
00:14:02,160 --> 00:14:03,199
your company or

453
00:14:03,199 --> 00:14:04,800
it is you know a solution that you're

454
00:14:04,800 --> 00:14:07,120
building you want to think about

455
00:14:07,120 --> 00:14:09,519
developer tools model after developer

456
00:14:09,519 --> 00:14:10,959
tools

457
00:14:10,959 --> 00:14:12,560
and there's a great this is a screenshot

458
00:14:12,560 --> 00:14:14,480
from the openview devtooling gtm

459
00:14:14,480 --> 00:14:15,040
playbook

460
00:14:15,040 --> 00:14:17,199
which is a great read that i recommend

461
00:14:17,199 --> 00:14:18,480
and i actually just said that this

462
00:14:18,480 --> 00:14:21,040
tooltip over here

463
00:14:21,040 --> 00:14:22,560
and then the third and very very

464
00:14:22,560 --> 00:14:24,800
important bit to remember

465
00:14:24,800 --> 00:14:27,839
is that security team security people

466
00:14:27,839 --> 00:14:31,040
audit and developers fix

467
00:14:31,040 --> 00:14:33,600
and that's a very very significant

468
00:14:33,600 --> 00:14:34,720
distinction it's not

469
00:14:34,720 --> 00:14:36,639
a statement to the detriment of either

470
00:14:36,639 --> 00:14:37,760
party

471
00:14:37,760 --> 00:14:40,079
an auditor's job primarily is to make us

472
00:14:40,079 --> 00:14:42,160
aware make the company aware make the

473
00:14:42,160 --> 00:14:43,199
developers aware

474
00:14:43,199 --> 00:14:45,519
of the security flaws in there and that

475
00:14:45,519 --> 00:14:47,120
that are in the systems they're building

476
00:14:47,120 --> 00:14:49,040
to provide platforms to help them find

477
00:14:49,040 --> 00:14:50,800
those issues and then to ensure that

478
00:14:50,800 --> 00:14:52,480
those are logged and prioritized and

479
00:14:52,480 --> 00:14:54,480
captured in the right fashion

480
00:14:54,480 --> 00:14:57,120
but a developer's job isn't those yes

481
00:14:57,120 --> 00:14:58,639
they also need to find issues and they

482
00:14:58,639 --> 00:15:00,560
need to run it but their primary job is

483
00:15:00,560 --> 00:15:01,279
to fix them

484
00:15:01,279 --> 00:15:03,279
the primary job is not to be aware of

485
00:15:03,279 --> 00:15:05,120
bugs their primary job is to fix the

486
00:15:05,120 --> 00:15:05,920
bugs

487
00:15:05,920 --> 00:15:08,079
so there's a whole set of steps that go

488
00:15:08,079 --> 00:15:10,079
from a logged issue

489
00:15:10,079 --> 00:15:12,800
to a fixed issue that's through security

490
00:15:12,800 --> 00:15:14,320
or otherwise

491
00:15:14,320 --> 00:15:16,320
it's amazing how many security solutions

492
00:15:16,320 --> 00:15:17,519
are out there again homegrown or

493
00:15:17,519 --> 00:15:18,399
commercial

494
00:15:18,399 --> 00:15:20,959
that even state when they talk about

495
00:15:20,959 --> 00:15:22,240
fixed there's fixed button there's a

496
00:15:22,240 --> 00:15:23,600
remediation section

497
00:15:23,600 --> 00:15:25,600
where the remediation is logging a jira

498
00:15:25,600 --> 00:15:27,600
ticket logging a jira ticket is very

499
00:15:27,600 --> 00:15:28,240
important

500
00:15:28,240 --> 00:15:30,639
it is not remediation it is just that

501
00:15:30,639 --> 00:15:32,639
it's logging a jira ticket it's

502
00:15:32,639 --> 00:15:34,160
logging a ticket instead of in a

503
00:15:34,160 --> 00:15:36,399
separate system in the development team

504
00:15:36,399 --> 00:15:37,519
system which is

505
00:15:37,519 --> 00:15:40,079
better but not sufficient and so you

506
00:15:40,079 --> 00:15:41,199
want to think

507
00:15:41,199 --> 00:15:42,480
the whole journey think through the

508
00:15:42,480 --> 00:15:44,639
whole journey in the homegrown or in the

509
00:15:44,639 --> 00:15:45,839
practice or in the process or in the

510
00:15:45,839 --> 00:15:47,199
commercial tools you're building

511
00:15:47,199 --> 00:15:48,959
think about how do you bring it all the

512
00:15:48,959 --> 00:15:50,720
way to actually fixing

513
00:15:50,720 --> 00:15:53,440
the problem actually helping a developer

514
00:15:53,440 --> 00:15:56,160
fix the problem

515
00:15:56,160 --> 00:15:59,199
so all of those combine into

516
00:15:59,199 --> 00:16:02,720
a a a more meta

517
00:16:02,720 --> 00:16:04,320
perspective which is when we think about

518
00:16:04,320 --> 00:16:06,240
debt for security we need to remember

519
00:16:06,240 --> 00:16:07,199
that our goal

520
00:16:07,199 --> 00:16:09,759
isn't to shift left as you see on the

521
00:16:09,759 --> 00:16:11,279
left of the screen here

522
00:16:11,279 --> 00:16:13,440
ironically uh you know isn't really

523
00:16:13,440 --> 00:16:15,040
around shift left which is a

524
00:16:15,040 --> 00:16:17,600
that's a that's a great practice to

525
00:16:17,600 --> 00:16:18,800
shift left it's a

526
00:16:18,800 --> 00:16:21,519
it came from the waterfall practice you

527
00:16:21,519 --> 00:16:22,880
know i was saying shift left back in

528
00:16:22,880 --> 00:16:24,399
2002 when i was building

529
00:16:24,399 --> 00:16:26,959
kind of appscan and app shield back then

530
00:16:26,959 --> 00:16:28,079
and

531
00:16:28,079 --> 00:16:30,399
those that the notion of shifting left

532
00:16:30,399 --> 00:16:31,839
is an efficiency play it's around

533
00:16:31,839 --> 00:16:33,440
don't find the issues after you've

534
00:16:33,440 --> 00:16:34,880
deployed find them

535
00:16:34,880 --> 00:16:36,480
early find them as you design them as

536
00:16:36,480 --> 00:16:38,079
you build them you know as you

537
00:16:38,079 --> 00:16:40,079
as you could review them and it's great

538
00:16:40,079 --> 00:16:41,680
and it is indeed more efficient

539
00:16:41,680 --> 00:16:44,320
but it's just not enough shifting left

540
00:16:44,320 --> 00:16:46,959
taking the same audit you would have run

541
00:16:46,959 --> 00:16:49,360
late and running it early is really only

542
00:16:49,360 --> 00:16:50,560
a small piece of the problem and it's

543
00:16:50,560 --> 00:16:51,279
not at all

544
00:16:51,279 --> 00:16:52,959
devops find it it's just an efficiency

545
00:16:52,959 --> 00:16:55,360
play the real change that we want is one

546
00:16:55,360 --> 00:16:56,720
of the top to bottom

547
00:16:56,720 --> 00:16:59,040
today development process is continuous

548
00:16:59,040 --> 00:17:00,560
these teams need to own

549
00:17:00,560 --> 00:17:03,040
their entire journey so they own the

550
00:17:03,040 --> 00:17:04,640
stuff that happens on the right and the

551
00:17:04,640 --> 00:17:05,839
stuff that opens on the left

552
00:17:05,839 --> 00:17:08,720
that happens on the left and really what

553
00:17:08,720 --> 00:17:10,480
you want them to do is you want them to

554
00:17:10,480 --> 00:17:11,039
own

555
00:17:11,039 --> 00:17:14,000
that the security aspect of that journey

556
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:14,880
successfully

557
00:17:14,880 --> 00:17:16,559
and you want them to do that on the left

558
00:17:16,559 --> 00:17:17,760
and you want them to do that on the

559
00:17:17,760 --> 00:17:18,079
right

560
00:17:18,079 --> 00:17:19,919
and you really ideally you want them to

561
00:17:19,919 --> 00:17:21,599
decide what is

562
00:17:21,599 --> 00:17:23,599
when is the right time for them to run

563
00:17:23,599 --> 00:17:25,679
it because you want them to own the risk

564
00:17:25,679 --> 00:17:27,359
equipped with the right solutions to be

565
00:17:27,359 --> 00:17:29,039
able to address it and so

566
00:17:29,039 --> 00:17:31,280
keep it in mind shift left is great but

567
00:17:31,280 --> 00:17:32,080
really the

568
00:17:32,080 --> 00:17:34,400
primary goal for this exercise is an

569
00:17:34,400 --> 00:17:35,360
ownership change

570
00:17:35,360 --> 00:17:37,840
it's it's a top to bottom from from a

571
00:17:37,840 --> 00:17:39,760
dictatorial sort of centralized

572
00:17:39,760 --> 00:17:41,440
security team that makes the decisions

573
00:17:41,440 --> 00:17:43,039
for everybody else to

574
00:17:43,039 --> 00:17:45,679
more of a democratized model in which

575
00:17:45,679 --> 00:17:47,200
these development teams are able to

576
00:17:47,200 --> 00:17:48,799
to run with the right tools with the

577
00:17:48,799 --> 00:17:50,640
right governance they still need to be

578
00:17:50,640 --> 00:17:53,679
kind of monitored and tracked but they

579
00:17:53,679 --> 00:17:55,760
need to be able to operate that security

580
00:17:55,760 --> 00:17:58,000
and make good judgment with sound

581
00:17:58,000 --> 00:17:59,039
judgment calls

582
00:17:59,039 --> 00:18:04,000
uh and build secure things on their own

583
00:18:04,559 --> 00:18:08,160
so with that let's talk about um

584
00:18:08,160 --> 00:18:09,600
cloud you know all of this was really

585
00:18:09,600 --> 00:18:10,960
depth for security and you can say that

586
00:18:10,960 --> 00:18:11,840
for security

587
00:18:11,840 --> 00:18:14,320
is adapting security to devops

588
00:18:14,320 --> 00:18:15,760
fundamentally it's around adapting

589
00:18:15,760 --> 00:18:17,120
security to this

590
00:18:17,120 --> 00:18:18,640
model of independent teams and those

591
00:18:18,640 --> 00:18:20,320
independent teams happen to be primarily

592
00:18:20,320 --> 00:18:21,280
developers

593
00:18:21,280 --> 00:18:23,360
application developers cloud as we

594
00:18:23,360 --> 00:18:24,320
talked about

595
00:18:24,320 --> 00:18:26,400
requires us to sort of rethink a bunch

596
00:18:26,400 --> 00:18:28,640
of these i.t security solutions

597
00:18:28,640 --> 00:18:31,679
into application security so let's dig a

598
00:18:31,679 --> 00:18:34,080
bit more

599
00:18:34,080 --> 00:18:37,360
um as before rethinking i.t security

600
00:18:37,360 --> 00:18:38,559
into application security is not

601
00:18:38,559 --> 00:18:39,840
something i'm going to cover in sort of

602
00:18:39,840 --> 00:18:42,160
five minutes here for you you have to

603
00:18:42,160 --> 00:18:43,760
dig deeper you know hopefully the book

604
00:18:43,760 --> 00:18:45,200
gives you a bit more information

605
00:18:45,200 --> 00:18:46,640
but still there's more it's more of a

606
00:18:46,640 --> 00:18:48,799
meta concept

607
00:18:48,799 --> 00:18:51,520
but if i was to sort of give you three

608
00:18:51,520 --> 00:18:52,799
core anchors

609
00:18:52,799 --> 00:18:54,880
the first element to it is to remember

610
00:18:54,880 --> 00:18:56,240
that your infrastructure

611
00:18:56,240 --> 00:18:58,799
is in your repo so this statement today

612
00:18:58,799 --> 00:19:00,559
you have a repository it has

613
00:19:00,559 --> 00:19:02,240
the full stack you know everything

614
00:19:02,240 --> 00:19:03,919
around it sits in that repository

615
00:19:03,919 --> 00:19:05,840
sometimes it's a neighboring repository

616
00:19:05,840 --> 00:19:07,840
but your code your

617
00:19:07,840 --> 00:19:10,000
open source manifest and your container

618
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:11,360
configuration and your

619
00:19:11,360 --> 00:19:13,120
helm charts and oftentimes terraform

620
00:19:13,120 --> 00:19:14,720
files all of these things they sit in

621
00:19:14,720 --> 00:19:15,840
the repository

622
00:19:15,840 --> 00:19:18,160
what this means is that you have to

623
00:19:18,160 --> 00:19:20,480
rethink or start by thinking about

624
00:19:20,480 --> 00:19:21,760
tooling that work

625
00:19:21,760 --> 00:19:25,600
in the context of a repo a pipeline

626
00:19:25,600 --> 00:19:29,440
these are constraints and an advantage

627
00:19:29,440 --> 00:19:31,840
so you want to think about where do you

628
00:19:31,840 --> 00:19:32,960
run your test

629
00:19:32,960 --> 00:19:35,039
you should run it where possible more

630
00:19:35,039 --> 00:19:36,400
like other application security

631
00:19:36,400 --> 00:19:38,720
solutions so can you find

632
00:19:38,720 --> 00:19:41,200
a cloud security problem or a container

633
00:19:41,200 --> 00:19:42,559
security problem

634
00:19:42,559 --> 00:19:44,559
in the ide can you find it when

635
00:19:44,559 --> 00:19:46,160
something got created in the repo can

636
00:19:46,160 --> 00:19:47,760
you find it in the build the builds

637
00:19:47,760 --> 00:19:49,440
people are a bit more familiar with

638
00:19:49,440 --> 00:19:51,120
but can you think about the fact that

639
00:19:51,120 --> 00:19:53,039
your infrastructure is in the repo

640
00:19:53,039 --> 00:19:56,160
it's a it means you you will be well

641
00:19:56,160 --> 00:19:57,600
rewarded

642
00:19:57,600 --> 00:19:59,919
if you build solutions if you build

643
00:19:59,919 --> 00:20:00,720
something

644
00:20:00,720 --> 00:20:02,640
that can actually find those problems

645
00:20:02,640 --> 00:20:04,640
when they are in the repo when they are

646
00:20:04,640 --> 00:20:07,679
in development local development because

647
00:20:07,679 --> 00:20:09,440
that is that sort of shift left that is

648
00:20:09,440 --> 00:20:11,120
that early detection versus finding it

649
00:20:11,120 --> 00:20:11,520
late

650
00:20:11,520 --> 00:20:13,840
so you have to rethink how do you secure

651
00:20:13,840 --> 00:20:15,840
an aspect of infrastructure when it was

652
00:20:15,840 --> 00:20:16,159
still

653
00:20:16,159 --> 00:20:18,000
the code that leads to that

654
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:19,280
infrastructure and by saying

655
00:20:19,280 --> 00:20:20,400
infrastructure i mean

656
00:20:20,400 --> 00:20:22,159
all these layers that are below code

657
00:20:22,159 --> 00:20:24,320
here

658
00:20:24,640 --> 00:20:27,760
and i think i'll to kind of try and

659
00:20:27,760 --> 00:20:29,520
bring it home i'll give two examples one

660
00:20:29,520 --> 00:20:30,960
for container security and one for

661
00:20:30,960 --> 00:20:32,799
infrastructure as code of how you could

662
00:20:32,799 --> 00:20:33,520
do this

663
00:20:33,520 --> 00:20:35,360
so for example for container security a

664
00:20:35,360 --> 00:20:37,919
good example of it is separating out

665
00:20:37,919 --> 00:20:39,679
base image when you try to rethink

666
00:20:39,679 --> 00:20:41,120
container security from a dev

667
00:20:41,120 --> 00:20:44,799
first angle you can say uh that the the

668
00:20:44,799 --> 00:20:46,799
the distinction in how the base image is

669
00:20:46,799 --> 00:20:48,159
managed is

670
00:20:48,159 --> 00:20:49,840
very very big from an auditor

671
00:20:49,840 --> 00:20:51,919
perspective the base image

672
00:20:51,919 --> 00:20:54,240
doesn't really matter you you have a

673
00:20:54,240 --> 00:20:55,840
container image it has a bunch of files

674
00:20:55,840 --> 00:20:57,200
in it some of those are vulnerable

675
00:20:57,200 --> 00:20:58,320
artifacts

676
00:20:58,320 --> 00:21:00,080
you audit the image you find a bunch of

677
00:21:00,080 --> 00:21:02,559
vulnerabilities and and that's kind of

678
00:21:02,559 --> 00:21:02,960
the

679
00:21:02,960 --> 00:21:04,480
the end of the story you you found a

680
00:21:04,480 --> 00:21:06,080
vulnerability you go off to assess the

681
00:21:06,080 --> 00:21:07,760
risk that's the risk mentality i don't

682
00:21:07,760 --> 00:21:09,600
really care where it came from

683
00:21:09,600 --> 00:21:11,760
and care that the vulnerability is there

684
00:21:11,760 --> 00:21:12,799
for a developer

685
00:21:12,799 --> 00:21:14,400
it's night and day whether a

686
00:21:14,400 --> 00:21:16,080
vulnerability came from a base image

687
00:21:16,080 --> 00:21:18,720
or whether it came from from the docker

688
00:21:18,720 --> 00:21:19,919
file to an extent if it's in the base

689
00:21:19,919 --> 00:21:20,480
image

690
00:21:20,480 --> 00:21:22,240
it's an upgrade exercise okay i need to

691
00:21:22,240 --> 00:21:23,520
take the newer version of the

692
00:21:23,520 --> 00:21:25,120
base image or swap it if it's in the

693
00:21:25,120 --> 00:21:26,880
docker file it's in my code

694
00:21:26,880 --> 00:21:28,559
i actually created it over there there's

695
00:21:28,559 --> 00:21:30,159
a code change that i need to do

696
00:21:30,159 --> 00:21:31,440
so that's sort of one example of

697
00:21:31,440 --> 00:21:33,520
rethinking container security into that

698
00:21:33,520 --> 00:21:35,760
first again one of many

699
00:21:35,760 --> 00:21:38,559
um another example is in infrastructure

700
00:21:38,559 --> 00:21:40,320
as code

701
00:21:40,320 --> 00:21:42,159
skipping slide here so in your

702
00:21:42,159 --> 00:21:43,360
infrastructure's code

703
00:21:43,360 --> 00:21:45,120
you can think about what is the

704
00:21:45,120 --> 00:21:46,559
continuation of the information you

705
00:21:46,559 --> 00:21:48,880
provide so you scanned a terraform file

706
00:21:48,880 --> 00:21:49,600
and you found

707
00:21:49,600 --> 00:21:52,640
a vulnerability um you find kind of some

708
00:21:52,640 --> 00:21:53,919
some mistake you've done it well you've

709
00:21:53,919 --> 00:21:54,480
done it

710
00:21:54,480 --> 00:21:56,960
in the repo or in the pipeline if you're

711
00:21:56,960 --> 00:21:58,080
a developer the next

712
00:21:58,080 --> 00:22:00,559
question is where is this in my app like

713
00:22:00,559 --> 00:22:01,840
which functionality

714
00:22:01,840 --> 00:22:03,919
does it touch so that i would know if i

715
00:22:03,919 --> 00:22:06,159
make this stricter if i change the user

716
00:22:06,159 --> 00:22:06,960
if i do one

717
00:22:06,960 --> 00:22:09,440
would i break the app from an auditor

718
00:22:09,440 --> 00:22:11,120
perspective you go down a very different

719
00:22:11,120 --> 00:22:13,440
route you go down the route of

720
00:22:13,440 --> 00:22:15,520
of risk you go down the route of saying

721
00:22:15,520 --> 00:22:17,360
okay so i have this

722
00:22:17,360 --> 00:22:19,360
like does it matter which data assets

723
00:22:19,360 --> 00:22:21,360
are exposed should i ring the alarm bell

724
00:22:21,360 --> 00:22:24,080
both are legitimate perspectives but

725
00:22:24,080 --> 00:22:24,559
they are

726
00:22:24,559 --> 00:22:26,000
very very different so you want to think

727
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:27,360
about your solution and where does it

728
00:22:27,360 --> 00:22:28,880
guide the developer if you give a

729
00:22:28,880 --> 00:22:29,760
developer

730
00:22:29,760 --> 00:22:32,159
the auditor perspective they will not be

731
00:22:32,159 --> 00:22:34,720
successful

732
00:22:35,280 --> 00:22:36,799
so this is probably a good point to say

733
00:22:36,799 --> 00:22:39,280
i'm not dissing the security perspective

734
00:22:39,280 --> 00:22:41,120
security people are critical to all of

735
00:22:41,120 --> 00:22:42,720
our success you know some of my best

736
00:22:42,720 --> 00:22:43,039
friends

737
00:22:43,039 --> 00:22:44,960
are security people you know it's it's

738
00:22:44,960 --> 00:22:46,480
super super critical to keep the

739
00:22:46,480 --> 00:22:47,440
organization secure

740
00:22:47,440 --> 00:22:49,679
that you have that risk perspective all

741
00:22:49,679 --> 00:22:51,360
i'm saying is it's not going to get you

742
00:22:51,360 --> 00:22:52,480
developer adoption

743
00:22:52,480 --> 00:22:55,760
so the mistake happens when you build

744
00:22:55,760 --> 00:22:57,840
an auditor tool and you give it to

745
00:22:57,840 --> 00:22:59,679
developers and you expect them to

746
00:22:59,679 --> 00:23:00,799
successfully use it

747
00:23:00,799 --> 00:23:02,640
that's the piece that i'm saying would

748
00:23:02,640 --> 00:23:04,880
not happen

749
00:23:04,880 --> 00:23:08,000
so so we just went through

750
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:09,600
you know the kind of the general kind of

751
00:23:09,600 --> 00:23:11,120
pillars of digital transformation we

752
00:23:11,120 --> 00:23:11,840
talked about

753
00:23:11,840 --> 00:23:14,640
developer first security and how to sort

754
00:23:14,640 --> 00:23:16,320
maybe some tips around how do you

755
00:23:16,320 --> 00:23:18,880
adapt to it talk about cloud native apps

756
00:23:18,880 --> 00:23:19,760
and how do you want to

757
00:23:19,760 --> 00:23:22,000
rethink some of these i.t security

758
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:22,960
controls as a debt

759
00:23:22,960 --> 00:23:26,400
first application security approach

760
00:23:26,400 --> 00:23:29,280
maybe just before we wrap up two or

761
00:23:29,280 --> 00:23:29,679
three

762
00:23:29,679 --> 00:23:32,159
items about how do you adapt a little

763
00:23:32,159 --> 00:23:34,640
bit more broadly as an organization

764
00:23:34,640 --> 00:23:37,440
into into this this world right how do

765
00:23:37,440 --> 00:23:39,200
you rethink apsec into cnas

766
00:23:39,200 --> 00:23:40,720
as a security board what should you

767
00:23:40,720 --> 00:23:43,039
consider

768
00:23:43,039 --> 00:23:46,000
so the first thing to consider is the

769
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:47,279
security organization

770
00:23:47,279 --> 00:23:50,400
itself um when you

771
00:23:50,400 --> 00:23:52,400
when you envision this reality in which

772
00:23:52,400 --> 00:23:53,600
developers own

773
00:23:53,600 --> 00:23:56,080
a lot of security that means the job of

774
00:23:56,080 --> 00:23:57,520
the security person

775
00:23:57,520 --> 00:24:00,480
is different uh it means if i look at

776
00:24:00,480 --> 00:24:01,279
the right

777
00:24:01,279 --> 00:24:04,240
that they are no longer meant to audit

778
00:24:04,240 --> 00:24:05,919
you know it's not the security team's

779
00:24:05,919 --> 00:24:06,559
job to

780
00:24:06,559 --> 00:24:09,840
find vulnerabilities and to you know

781
00:24:09,840 --> 00:24:11,760
log them into all do all of that because

782
00:24:11,760 --> 00:24:13,520
that one scale that's precisely what

783
00:24:13,520 --> 00:24:14,880
we've been doing

784
00:24:14,880 --> 00:24:17,440
and and have been in this independence

785
00:24:17,440 --> 00:24:18,480
team model

786
00:24:18,480 --> 00:24:20,720
running into a blocker what you need is

787
00:24:20,720 --> 00:24:22,559
you need that same team

788
00:24:22,559 --> 00:24:25,600
to build solutions to provide whether

789
00:24:25,600 --> 00:24:27,200
they bought or they built doesn't really

790
00:24:27,200 --> 00:24:27,760
matter

791
00:24:27,760 --> 00:24:30,640
to provide solutions to the developers

792
00:24:30,640 --> 00:24:32,480
so the developers can do those audits

793
00:24:32,480 --> 00:24:33,840
themselves as a natural part of their

794
00:24:33,840 --> 00:24:34,720
development process

795
00:24:34,720 --> 00:24:37,279
so they can find those vulnerabilities

796
00:24:37,279 --> 00:24:38,880
so it means within the team you're going

797
00:24:38,880 --> 00:24:39,360
to need

798
00:24:39,360 --> 00:24:41,840
less auditing skills and more

799
00:24:41,840 --> 00:24:43,039
engineering skills

800
00:24:43,039 --> 00:24:45,360
more platform building skills this is

801
00:24:45,360 --> 00:24:47,360
very similar to the sre

802
00:24:47,360 --> 00:24:49,679
type shift that has happened where

803
00:24:49,679 --> 00:24:50,559
you're not the one

804
00:24:50,559 --> 00:24:52,240
on call sometimes you are but that's not

805
00:24:52,240 --> 00:24:54,720
a primary job your primary job is to

806
00:24:54,720 --> 00:24:55,279
help

807
00:24:55,279 --> 00:24:58,720
developers build an operable system

808
00:24:58,720 --> 00:25:00,880
and on the left is really more around

809
00:25:00,880 --> 00:25:02,559
that cloud native aspect

810
00:25:02,559 --> 00:25:04,799
is you want to rethink the scope of the

811
00:25:04,799 --> 00:25:06,400
team well we have this

812
00:25:06,400 --> 00:25:08,559
newer team over the last sort of ten or

813
00:25:08,559 --> 00:25:09,919
so five to ten years

814
00:25:09,919 --> 00:25:11,679
uh titled cloud security and cloud

815
00:25:11,679 --> 00:25:13,039
security uh

816
00:25:13,039 --> 00:25:15,600
you know has a bit of a built-in

817
00:25:15,600 --> 00:25:18,000
identity crisis to it on one aspect

818
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:19,919
it is the evolution of i.t security it's

819
00:25:19,919 --> 00:25:21,440
the evolution of securing your data

820
00:25:21,440 --> 00:25:22,640
center now you're securing

821
00:25:22,640 --> 00:25:24,159
the thing that's in the cloud as well as

822
00:25:24,159 --> 00:25:26,640
some of the cloud-specific attributes

823
00:25:26,640 --> 00:25:29,600
on the other side you have uh all of

824
00:25:29,600 --> 00:25:30,159
these

825
00:25:30,159 --> 00:25:31,840
aspects of infrastructure that have

826
00:25:31,840 --> 00:25:33,520
moved into the app and they need to be

827
00:25:33,520 --> 00:25:37,120
application security minded and so

828
00:25:37,120 --> 00:25:39,039
it's a tricky proposition the industry

829
00:25:39,039 --> 00:25:40,720
hasn't quite decided where it is

830
00:25:40,720 --> 00:25:43,120
but my advice would be to think about

831
00:25:43,120 --> 00:25:45,360
expanding the scope of your application

832
00:25:45,360 --> 00:25:46,480
security team which

833
00:25:46,480 --> 00:25:48,640
has historically been deemed more you

834
00:25:48,640 --> 00:25:50,720
know your your code and your libraries

835
00:25:50,720 --> 00:25:52,559
maybe sort of securing those

836
00:25:52,559 --> 00:25:55,679
to more of a product security team and

837
00:25:55,679 --> 00:25:56,000
that

838
00:25:56,000 --> 00:25:57,919
includes the broader the full set of

839
00:25:57,919 --> 00:25:59,440
products whatever that includes it

840
00:25:59,440 --> 00:26:00,640
includes a bunch of these layers it

841
00:26:00,640 --> 00:26:01,039
includes

842
00:26:01,039 --> 00:26:04,080
security features that view should

843
00:26:04,080 --> 00:26:06,559
help you first of all centralize and

844
00:26:06,559 --> 00:26:08,320
think about those iot security aspects

845
00:26:08,320 --> 00:26:09,360
as

846
00:26:09,360 --> 00:26:12,400
as as parts of the app or infrastructure

847
00:26:12,400 --> 00:26:13,440
security aspects

848
00:26:13,440 --> 00:26:15,120
as part of the app but also it will help

849
00:26:15,120 --> 00:26:16,559
you empathize and

850
00:26:16,559 --> 00:26:19,279
be closer in your perspective to the

851
00:26:19,279 --> 00:26:20,400
engineering teams that you are

852
00:26:20,400 --> 00:26:22,880
supporting

853
00:26:22,960 --> 00:26:24,480
the second thing is to rethink

854
00:26:24,480 --> 00:26:26,080
priorities um

855
00:26:26,080 --> 00:26:28,400
so most abstract programs start from

856
00:26:28,400 --> 00:26:30,080
some you know sas highest

857
00:26:30,080 --> 00:26:32,480
you know type you know four letter combo

858
00:26:32,480 --> 00:26:33,279
uh and

859
00:26:33,279 --> 00:26:34,320
when you start to think about it the

860
00:26:34,320 --> 00:26:35,840
majority the vast majority of those is

861
00:26:35,840 --> 00:26:38,240
defined vulnerabilities in your code

862
00:26:38,240 --> 00:26:40,880
and and that's okay that's legit because

863
00:26:40,880 --> 00:26:42,720
up until not that long ago

864
00:26:42,720 --> 00:26:44,480
that was the primary job of developers

865
00:26:44,480 --> 00:26:46,000
so appsec was primarily about

866
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:47,760
vulnerabilities in your code

867
00:26:47,760 --> 00:26:49,919
as we just discussed that is no longer

868
00:26:49,919 --> 00:26:52,159
the case now there's a broader scope so

869
00:26:52,159 --> 00:26:53,120
you want to

870
00:26:53,120 --> 00:26:56,799
pause and think given the full scope of

871
00:26:56,799 --> 00:26:58,480
cloud native abstech

872
00:26:58,480 --> 00:27:00,880
which threats am i most likely to be

873
00:27:00,880 --> 00:27:01,919
breached by

874
00:27:01,919 --> 00:27:04,000
is it more likely that i'll be breached

875
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:06,720
by a vulnerability in my custom code

876
00:27:06,720 --> 00:27:09,840
or by an insecure

877
00:27:09,840 --> 00:27:11,600
piece of infrastructure right or an

878
00:27:11,600 --> 00:27:13,600
unpatched vulnerability in my batch

879
00:27:13,600 --> 00:27:14,960
library

880
00:27:14,960 --> 00:27:17,360
so the decisions would be yours and they

881
00:27:17,360 --> 00:27:18,000
vary

882
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:20,000
but what i would say is pause think

883
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:21,039
about the full scope

884
00:27:21,039 --> 00:27:23,200
now it's going to be the same developers

885
00:27:23,200 --> 00:27:24,159
you know the same dev

886
00:27:24,159 --> 00:27:26,399
time going to fix a container security

887
00:27:26,399 --> 00:27:27,360
vulnerability

888
00:27:27,360 --> 00:27:30,399
will come at the expense of uh fixing a

889
00:27:30,399 --> 00:27:32,399
code vulnerability and vice versa

890
00:27:32,399 --> 00:27:34,159
so you want to think about your

891
00:27:34,159 --> 00:27:37,840
priorities a bit more holistically

892
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:40,000
and then last and this is last this is

893
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:41,440
after you've formed your perspective and

894
00:27:41,440 --> 00:27:42,799
you formed your structure if you want to

895
00:27:42,799 --> 00:27:44,159
rethink the tooling

896
00:27:44,159 --> 00:27:45,919
uh and i've already kind of harped on a

897
00:27:45,919 --> 00:27:48,559
bunch of this so i don't want to uh

898
00:27:48,559 --> 00:27:50,480
boil the ocean too much here but i would

899
00:27:50,480 --> 00:27:52,240
say first think about

900
00:27:52,240 --> 00:27:54,399
tools in the context of developer tools

901
00:27:54,399 --> 00:27:56,159
and and judge whatever solution you're

902
00:27:56,159 --> 00:27:57,200
building or buying

903
00:27:57,200 --> 00:27:59,360
towards that effect second is think

904
00:27:59,360 --> 00:28:00,399
about the platform

905
00:28:00,399 --> 00:28:02,799
scope yes you can look for a if you're

906
00:28:02,799 --> 00:28:03,919
looking for a platform if you want to

907
00:28:03,919 --> 00:28:04,960
minimize vendors

908
00:28:04,960 --> 00:28:06,399
you can look for a platform that has the

909
00:28:06,399 --> 00:28:08,480
classic das test and all the sort of ast

910
00:28:08,480 --> 00:28:09,520
acronyms in it

911
00:28:09,520 --> 00:28:11,520
but i would say you'd be well served by

912
00:28:11,520 --> 00:28:12,799
thinking about the full scope of

913
00:28:12,799 --> 00:28:14,080
everything you want your developers to

914
00:28:14,080 --> 00:28:14,960
deal with

915
00:28:14,960 --> 00:28:16,720
and think about a platform that supports

916
00:28:16,720 --> 00:28:18,080
that full scope

917
00:28:18,080 --> 00:28:19,840
and then the third and it's more subtle

918
00:28:19,840 --> 00:28:20,640
and you're going to have to make a

919
00:28:20,640 --> 00:28:22,159
judgment goal is to say look at the

920
00:28:22,159 --> 00:28:23,840
solutions you're building or buying

921
00:28:23,840 --> 00:28:26,159
and say what's the governance approach

922
00:28:26,159 --> 00:28:27,200
that they support

923
00:28:27,200 --> 00:28:29,600
are they focusing on hey you're a

924
00:28:29,600 --> 00:28:30,880
security person you found a

925
00:28:30,880 --> 00:28:32,159
vulnerability how do you then

926
00:28:32,159 --> 00:28:34,320
communicate it back to your developers

927
00:28:34,320 --> 00:28:36,799
or do they focus on hey you're a

928
00:28:36,799 --> 00:28:37,840
security person

929
00:28:37,840 --> 00:28:41,120
how can you help your developers find

930
00:28:41,120 --> 00:28:42,480
find those issues themselves and deal

931
00:28:42,480 --> 00:28:44,000
with them themselves and how do you

932
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:44,799
govern

933
00:28:44,799 --> 00:28:46,240
their activity and of course

934
00:28:46,240 --> 00:28:48,399
subsequently how does this system help

935
00:28:48,399 --> 00:28:49,520
those developers

936
00:28:49,520 --> 00:28:52,080
handle those security concerns and so

937
00:28:52,080 --> 00:28:52,799
just

938
00:28:52,799 --> 00:28:54,960
pause and think about tools not based on

939
00:28:54,960 --> 00:28:56,000
the old

940
00:28:56,000 --> 00:28:58,480
models but rather based on on the new

941
00:28:58,480 --> 00:28:59,679
scope and the new approach you're

942
00:28:59,679 --> 00:29:02,480
hopefully embracing

943
00:29:02,799 --> 00:29:05,360
so that that's basically it for me right

944
00:29:05,360 --> 00:29:06,320
we talked about

945
00:29:06,320 --> 00:29:08,640
security transformation to match digital

946
00:29:08,640 --> 00:29:10,399
transformation it's a must

947
00:29:10,399 --> 00:29:13,039
for everybody because everybody's

948
00:29:13,039 --> 00:29:14,559
undergoing digital transformation and

949
00:29:14,559 --> 00:29:15,360
every

950
00:29:15,360 --> 00:29:17,760
large company wants to be able to work

951
00:29:17,760 --> 00:29:19,279
to have development

952
00:29:19,279 --> 00:29:21,520
independent development teams work as

953
00:29:21,520 --> 00:29:23,039
nimbly as that sort of you know

954
00:29:23,039 --> 00:29:25,840
new scrappy startup and those

955
00:29:25,840 --> 00:29:27,679
independent teams they require

956
00:29:27,679 --> 00:29:29,440
dev first security solutions we have to

957
00:29:29,440 --> 00:29:30,960
think about our solutions in a different

958
00:29:30,960 --> 00:29:32,399
fashion

959
00:29:32,399 --> 00:29:33,840
you want to make sure that you apply

960
00:29:33,840 --> 00:29:36,240
appsec to the full cloud native appsec

961
00:29:36,240 --> 00:29:38,559
scope including those previously id

962
00:29:38,559 --> 00:29:40,159
layers and you want to rethink your

963
00:29:40,159 --> 00:29:41,919
organization your security org

964
00:29:41,919 --> 00:29:43,760
your priorities and your tooling to

965
00:29:43,760 --> 00:29:45,120
match this world

966
00:29:45,120 --> 00:29:48,399
and if you do all of those well you get

967
00:29:48,399 --> 00:29:49,840
a chance to profit you get a chance to

968
00:29:49,840 --> 00:29:50,559
be

969
00:29:50,559 --> 00:29:52,640
better than the competition and you get

970
00:29:52,640 --> 00:29:54,320
a chance for security

971
00:29:54,320 --> 00:29:57,760
to be an enabler for security to benefit

972
00:29:57,760 --> 00:30:01,039
you know the way devops did from from a

973
00:30:01,039 --> 00:30:01,919
more

974
00:30:01,919 --> 00:30:05,279
uh uh builder mentality from a

975
00:30:05,279 --> 00:30:07,120
more builder appreciation in your

976
00:30:07,120 --> 00:30:08,960
organization and be seen as something

977
00:30:08,960 --> 00:30:10,159
that helps the organization

978
00:30:10,159 --> 00:30:12,399
thrive versus just managing some side

979
00:30:12,399 --> 00:30:13,200
risk

980
00:30:13,200 --> 00:30:21,440
so good luck
