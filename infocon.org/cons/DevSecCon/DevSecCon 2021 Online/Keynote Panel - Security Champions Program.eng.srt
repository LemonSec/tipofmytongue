00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:13,280
hello everyone and

3
00:00:13,280 --> 00:00:15,599
welcome to our second keynote panel this

4
00:00:15,599 --> 00:00:17,279
time in the apj region and

5
00:00:17,279 --> 00:00:19,359
today we're going to be talking about

6
00:00:19,359 --> 00:00:21,359
security champions programs a very

7
00:00:21,359 --> 00:00:22,640
popular trendy

8
00:00:22,640 --> 00:00:24,880
topic for people who are looking to

9
00:00:24,880 --> 00:00:26,400
really engage with

10
00:00:26,400 --> 00:00:28,720
development teams from security teams

11
00:00:28,720 --> 00:00:29,599
and really

12
00:00:29,599 --> 00:00:31,519
increase that collaboration within their

13
00:00:31,519 --> 00:00:32,640
organization so

14
00:00:32,640 --> 00:00:35,680
uh joining me today we have uh we have

15
00:00:35,680 --> 00:00:38,719
nick from uh pearson uh we have

16
00:00:38,719 --> 00:00:42,800
uh yash from twilio and we have marissa

17
00:00:42,800 --> 00:00:44,320
from atlassian and i'll

18
00:00:44,320 --> 00:00:46,480
i'll let you uh folks introduce

19
00:00:46,480 --> 00:00:48,399
yourselves in just a second but a couple

20
00:00:48,399 --> 00:00:49,039
of things

21
00:00:49,039 --> 00:00:51,039
uh just to start off that we're going to

22
00:00:51,039 --> 00:00:52,960
be talking about today

23
00:00:52,960 --> 00:00:54,320
we're going to really be talking about

24
00:00:54,320 --> 00:00:55,840
security champions from the ground up

25
00:00:55,840 --> 00:00:56,879
and that's going to be

26
00:00:56,879 --> 00:00:58,800
why first of all what a security

27
00:00:58,800 --> 00:01:00,160
champions program is

28
00:01:00,160 --> 00:01:02,399
why you might want to create one how a

29
00:01:02,399 --> 00:01:04,319
security champions program works

30
00:01:04,319 --> 00:01:06,479
and really what what we can get out of

31
00:01:06,479 --> 00:01:07,360
it um

32
00:01:07,360 --> 00:01:08,640
finally we're going to end up with that

33
00:01:08,640 --> 00:01:10,560
hard question of what does good look

34
00:01:10,560 --> 00:01:12,320
like and that's always the challenging

35
00:01:12,320 --> 00:01:14,159
challenging question so why don't i go

36
00:01:14,159 --> 00:01:15,600
around the room here and uh ask

37
00:01:15,600 --> 00:01:17,680
ask folks to introduce themselves and

38
00:01:17,680 --> 00:01:18,720
what they do out there

39
00:01:18,720 --> 00:01:20,880
at their various companies so uh yes

40
00:01:20,880 --> 00:01:22,320
you're first on the on the list here so

41
00:01:22,320 --> 00:01:23,119
why don't we uh

42
00:01:23,119 --> 00:01:25,759

across all of our

56
00:01:53,520 --> 00:01:57,600
product teams wonderful and marissa

57
00:01:57,600 --> 00:02:00,719
hi everyone i'm marissa fagan here i

training team at atlassian

60
00:02:05,920 --> 00:02:09,440
and my team works directly with our team

61
00:02:09,440 --> 00:02:12,000
that uh and the product security team

62
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:14,520
that really is in charge of the

63
00:02:14,520 --> 00:02:18,640
ssdlc as well and uh we also

64
00:02:18,640 --> 00:02:20,879
are the team that kind of sponsors the

65
00:02:20,879 --> 00:02:22,800
security champions program

66
00:02:22,800 --> 00:02:24,319
awesome well thank you very much we've

67
00:02:24,319 --> 00:02:26,480
got people who have been very involved

68
00:02:26,480 --> 00:02:28,560
uh in security champions and mauricio

69
00:02:28,560 --> 00:02:30,400
have been involved with security

70
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:32,080
champions for for a number of different

71
00:02:32,080 --> 00:02:33,040
organizations

72
00:02:33,040 --> 00:02:35,280
i'll i'll start my first question um

73
00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:36,319
with yourself

74
00:02:36,319 --> 00:02:38,080
what is a security champions program to

75
00:02:38,080 --> 00:02:39,680
start off with what for people who have

76
00:02:39,680 --> 00:02:41,200
never heard of one what's the

77
00:02:41,200 --> 00:02:43,280
what's the what's the reason uh well

78
00:02:43,280 --> 00:02:44,959
like what is a security champion first

79
00:02:44,959 --> 00:02:46,319
of all

80
00:02:46,319 --> 00:02:48,959
uh so the security champions program is

81
00:02:48,959 --> 00:02:49,599
really

82
00:02:49,599 --> 00:02:53,519
the best win-win example of the

83
00:02:53,519 --> 00:02:56,000
relationship between the developer

84
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:59,040
and the security professional um

85
00:02:59,040 --> 00:03:01,920
so if there is a product security team

86
00:03:01,920 --> 00:03:04,720
or an application security program

87
00:03:04,720 --> 00:03:07,840
that is working with developers

88
00:03:07,840 --> 00:03:10,959
this is the way that your developers

89
00:03:10,959 --> 00:03:14,319
can really accomplish a lot for security

90
00:03:14,319 --> 00:03:18,480
without the security team having to

91
00:03:18,480 --> 00:03:22,480
be very have all of that overhead

92
00:03:22,480 --> 00:03:24,400
of doing the security program by

93
00:03:24,400 --> 00:03:26,319
themselves so that partnership

94
00:03:26,319 --> 00:03:28,400
between the developer team and the

95
00:03:28,400 --> 00:03:29,519
security team

96
00:03:29,519 --> 00:03:33,280
is going to help accomplish a lot more

97
00:03:33,280 --> 00:03:36,879
for both sides and for those of you who

98
00:03:36,879 --> 00:03:40,000
uh previously watched the first

99
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:42,000
panel we were talking about rollout of

100
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:43,280
security programs and

101
00:03:43,280 --> 00:03:45,120
security champions was briefly mentioned

102
00:03:45,120 --> 00:03:47,120
it's it's a great way of

103
00:03:47,120 --> 00:03:50,000
using an existing formal program to to

104
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:52,239
be able to roll out those new security

105
00:03:52,239 --> 00:03:54,080
uh security programs so that sounded

106
00:03:54,080 --> 00:03:55,760
pretty good to me uh marissa anyone else

107
00:03:55,760 --> 00:03:57,040
got anything to add to that

108
00:03:57,040 --> 00:04:00,400
or was that a pretty succinct uh

109
00:04:00,400 --> 00:04:03,439
description that covered it all

110
00:04:03,439 --> 00:04:04,799
that's a good description it was a good

111
00:04:04,799 --> 00:04:06,720
description it was so

112
00:04:06,720 --> 00:04:09,200
um how about the benefits it can provide

113
00:04:09,200 --> 00:04:10,239
so in terms of

114
00:04:10,239 --> 00:04:13,200
the goals of the champions um yes what

115
00:04:13,200 --> 00:04:14,080
what do you

116
00:04:14,080 --> 00:04:16,560
do at twilio in terms of what you want

117
00:04:16,560 --> 00:04:18,478
to achieve out of the program

118
00:04:18,478 --> 00:04:20,478
sure so on a high level we have

119
00:04:20,478 --> 00:04:22,400
champions on pretty much most of the

120
00:04:22,400 --> 00:04:23,840
engineering teams and we have an

121
00:04:23,840 --> 00:04:25,280
engineer on the security team who's

122
00:04:25,280 --> 00:04:27,280
their dedicated point of contact

123
00:04:27,280 --> 00:04:28,960
in terms of benefits i look at it from

124
00:04:28,960 --> 00:04:30,639
like both directions right like what do

125
00:04:30,639 --> 00:04:31,919
the engineering teams get out of it

126
00:04:31,919 --> 00:04:34,639
versus what does security get out of it

127
00:04:34,639 --> 00:04:37,120
from a security perspective we have a

128
00:04:37,120 --> 00:04:39,520
dedicated point of contact on the

129
00:04:39,520 --> 00:04:40,800
engineering team

130
00:04:40,800 --> 00:04:43,759
who we work with build relationship with

131
00:04:43,759 --> 00:04:45,199
know their product

132
00:04:45,199 --> 00:04:47,120
so that when they're building a new

133
00:04:47,120 --> 00:04:48,800
feature or a service or making

134
00:04:48,800 --> 00:04:50,560
modifications

135
00:04:50,560 --> 00:04:53,600
we get to review it in very early stages

136
00:04:53,600 --> 00:04:55,600
of their development life cycle

137
00:04:55,600 --> 00:04:58,479
so we can stop vulnerabilities before

138
00:04:58,479 --> 00:05:00,800
they enter code and also influence good

139
00:05:00,800 --> 00:05:03,600
design practices

140
00:05:03,600 --> 00:05:05,520
that's good any other benefits from

141
00:05:05,520 --> 00:05:06,800
others here

142
00:05:06,800 --> 00:05:09,680
from i think we use security champions

143
00:05:09,680 --> 00:05:11,360
in a similar way but our

144
00:05:11,360 --> 00:05:14,479
primary use is you know is to scale our

145
00:05:14,479 --> 00:05:16,880
security engineering function across all

146
00:05:16,880 --> 00:05:18,240
of our tech teams

147
00:05:18,240 --> 00:05:20,880
um by providing that point of contact

148
00:05:20,880 --> 00:05:22,240
who we can treat as

149
00:05:22,240 --> 00:05:24,160
basically a conduit for training up in

150
00:05:24,160 --> 00:05:25,600
security practices

151
00:05:25,600 --> 00:05:27,120
so they can then hopefully organically

152
00:05:27,120 --> 00:05:28,479
spread that knowledge throughout their

153
00:05:28,479 --> 00:05:28,960
team

154
00:05:28,960 --> 00:05:31,199
so a team can be become self-sufficient

155
00:05:31,199 --> 00:05:32,800
for their own security

156
00:05:32,800 --> 00:05:35,199
we treat our core security engineering

157
00:05:35,199 --> 00:05:36,320
team much as a

158
00:05:36,320 --> 00:05:38,880
consulting function within the tech org

159
00:05:38,880 --> 00:05:40,880
with the primary purpose of eventually

160
00:05:40,880 --> 00:05:42,720
having all of the developers feeling

161
00:05:42,720 --> 00:05:44,560
that they their security is

162
00:05:44,560 --> 00:05:46,479
their responsibility but we just use the

163
00:05:46,479 --> 00:05:47,840
security champions as

164
00:05:47,840 --> 00:05:50,840
kind of an efficient means to deliver

165
00:05:50,840 --> 00:05:52,240
that

166
00:05:52,240 --> 00:05:55,840
okay so in terms of the costs i guess

167
00:05:55,840 --> 00:05:57,280
that are associated everything has their

168
00:05:57,280 --> 00:05:58,479
costs whether it's

169
00:05:58,479 --> 00:06:01,600
monetary or people's time um what what

170
00:06:01,600 --> 00:06:02,479
are the

171
00:06:02,479 --> 00:06:03,759
we can see the benefits that we are

172
00:06:03,759 --> 00:06:05,199
trying to get out of the program how

173
00:06:05,199 --> 00:06:06,080
much does it cost

174
00:06:06,080 --> 00:06:09,039
in terms of time people uh that kind of

175
00:06:09,039 --> 00:06:10,319
stuff

176
00:06:10,319 --> 00:06:14,000
um research is someone who's

177
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:16,720
built big programs in larger

178
00:06:16,720 --> 00:06:18,000
organizations

179
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:21,039
i guess from that scaling point um

180
00:06:21,039 --> 00:06:24,160
the costs build up uh i guess as the the

181
00:06:24,160 --> 00:06:27,280
number of these uh champions grow so

182
00:06:27,280 --> 00:06:28,560
from your point of view how does that

183
00:06:28,560 --> 00:06:30,720
look

184
00:06:32,800 --> 00:06:35,840
i think you're on universe sure

185
00:06:35,840 --> 00:06:38,240
so this is a people problem and you need

186
00:06:38,240 --> 00:06:39,280
people to solve it

187
00:06:39,280 --> 00:06:42,720
so your first uh real cost is devoted

188
00:06:42,720 --> 00:06:43,919
headcount

189
00:06:43,919 --> 00:06:47,039
um having a devoted program manager to

190
00:06:47,039 --> 00:06:49,039
run the operations and the care and

191
00:06:49,039 --> 00:06:50,880
feeding of the program

192
00:06:50,880 --> 00:06:53,280
is really important as well as having

193
00:06:53,280 --> 00:06:55,360
dedicated time from each of your

194
00:06:55,360 --> 00:06:57,599
product security engineers to be

195
00:06:57,599 --> 00:06:58,400
supportive

196
00:06:58,400 --> 00:07:02,319
to the team to your developers that is

197
00:07:02,319 --> 00:07:03,919
really important and expensive

198
00:07:03,919 --> 00:07:07,599
having a dedicated amount of time 10

199
00:07:07,599 --> 00:07:10,639
20 of an engineer's time

200
00:07:10,639 --> 00:07:13,120
and then on the developer side um

201
00:07:13,120 --> 00:07:15,039
anywhere between 10 and 20 percent of

202
00:07:15,039 --> 00:07:16,160
their time as well

203
00:07:16,160 --> 00:07:18,560
devoted to working through security

204
00:07:18,560 --> 00:07:19,520
issues

205
00:07:19,520 --> 00:07:22,319
building security improvements and that

206
00:07:22,319 --> 00:07:23,039
sort of thing

207
00:07:23,039 --> 00:07:25,840
um it can feel like an ambitious goal

208
00:07:25,840 --> 00:07:26,160
but

209
00:07:26,160 --> 00:07:27,680
in order for the program to have

210
00:07:27,680 --> 00:07:30,240
longevity you really need to be all in

211
00:07:30,240 --> 00:07:32,400
and devote a substantial amount of time

212
00:07:32,400 --> 00:07:35,199
on every on both sides

213
00:07:35,199 --> 00:07:38,000
um and then as well there's sort of the

214
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:39,599
incentives of the program that you could

215
00:07:39,599 --> 00:07:40,560
consider

216
00:07:40,560 --> 00:07:43,759
and incentives can have monetary budget

217
00:07:43,759 --> 00:07:44,319
um

218
00:07:44,319 --> 00:07:46,720
you know there's always a better program

219
00:07:46,720 --> 00:07:48,400
with better budget

220
00:07:48,400 --> 00:07:51,599
um in our program we devote

221
00:07:51,599 --> 00:07:54,639
a lot of time to the incentives that

222
00:07:54,639 --> 00:07:58,080
we're offering um

223
00:07:58,080 --> 00:08:01,759
and being sure that you're devoting

224
00:08:01,759 --> 00:08:05,680
resources to training is important

225
00:08:05,680 --> 00:08:08,960
as well as in our program um

226
00:08:08,960 --> 00:08:11,280
taking a look at how you can provide

227
00:08:11,280 --> 00:08:12,560
feedback

228
00:08:12,560 --> 00:08:16,080
to the maybe the manager

229
00:08:16,080 --> 00:08:19,680
of your developer security champion uh

230
00:08:19,680 --> 00:08:20,800
providing that feedback is

231
00:08:20,800 --> 00:08:24,160
time-consuming but it can really help

232
00:08:24,160 --> 00:08:25,840
when that security champion is looking

233
00:08:25,840 --> 00:08:27,199
to go for

234
00:08:27,199 --> 00:08:29,520
their uh growth plan their promotion

235
00:08:29,520 --> 00:08:31,120
review that sort of thing

236
00:08:31,120 --> 00:08:34,240
having a concrete um

237
00:08:34,240 --> 00:08:37,120
explanation of how they contributed to

238
00:08:37,120 --> 00:08:38,559
the security champions program can

239
00:08:38,559 --> 00:08:40,240
really help them out in the long term

240
00:08:40,240 --> 00:08:42,719
and it's really uh a sign that the

241
00:08:42,719 --> 00:08:44,159
company is investing

242
00:08:44,159 --> 00:08:47,040
in your security champions yeah very

243
00:08:47,040 --> 00:08:48,399
interesting i'd love to get back to your

244
00:08:48,399 --> 00:08:49,360
point in terms of

245
00:08:49,360 --> 00:08:51,279
having a dedicated program manager

246
00:08:51,279 --> 00:08:53,120
because i find that very interesting so

247
00:08:53,120 --> 00:08:55,920
obviously atlassian huge company but how

248
00:08:55,920 --> 00:08:57,920
at what stage or what growth stage does

249
00:08:57,920 --> 00:08:59,120
a do you feel

250
00:08:59,120 --> 00:09:02,959
a dedicated person um or dedicated role

251
00:09:02,959 --> 00:09:05,279
to be that program manager is is is

252
00:09:05,279 --> 00:09:07,440
needed

253
00:09:07,440 --> 00:09:10,160
i think uh when when you have it you'll

254
00:09:10,160 --> 00:09:10,560
know

255
00:09:10,560 --> 00:09:12,720
this happens organically about the size

256
00:09:12,720 --> 00:09:14,080
of your program

257
00:09:14,080 --> 00:09:17,440
um so you first need a

258
00:09:17,440 --> 00:09:20,880
a person to own this and drive it and um

259
00:09:20,880 --> 00:09:23,360
that's probably going to start off as a

260
00:09:23,360 --> 00:09:25,040
product security engineer

261
00:09:25,040 --> 00:09:28,080
somebody on that side um but it quickly

262
00:09:28,080 --> 00:09:29,839
becomes a logistics issue and the

263
00:09:29,839 --> 00:09:31,279
operations of the program

264
00:09:31,279 --> 00:09:33,040
becomes something that a program manager

265
00:09:33,040 --> 00:09:36,000
has a a more

266
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:38,800
experienced talent with running so i

267
00:09:38,800 --> 00:09:39,279
think

268
00:09:39,279 --> 00:09:41,760
that you know you start very small uh

269
00:09:41,760 --> 00:09:42,800
we'll probably talk

270
00:09:42,800 --> 00:09:44,640
to this a little bit more later but

271
00:09:44,640 --> 00:09:46,720
starting a program you start small

272
00:09:46,720 --> 00:09:49,920
and in your pilot maybe that's just run

273
00:09:49,920 --> 00:09:50,959
with a few

274
00:09:50,959 --> 00:09:53,839
teams and a product security engineer

275
00:09:53,839 --> 00:09:54,720
and that

276
00:09:54,720 --> 00:09:57,200
after pilot stage the very next thing i

277
00:09:57,200 --> 00:09:57,760
would do

278
00:09:57,760 --> 00:10:01,040
is roll it over to a program manager

279
00:10:01,040 --> 00:10:04,720
for the growth of the program

280
00:10:04,720 --> 00:10:08,399
interesting okay um let's talk about the

281
00:10:08,399 --> 00:10:10,240
who needs to who needs to sponsor it who

282
00:10:10,240 --> 00:10:12,240
needs to who needs to back this in order

283
00:10:12,240 --> 00:10:13,120
for it to

284
00:10:13,120 --> 00:10:15,279
i guess be approved for an official

285
00:10:15,279 --> 00:10:17,440
program or for it to be rolled out

286
00:10:17,440 --> 00:10:20,640
across an organization um nick in your

287
00:10:20,640 --> 00:10:22,079
experience is this something that needs

288
00:10:22,079 --> 00:10:23,600
to happen from the top down and from an

289
00:10:23,600 --> 00:10:24,160
exec

290
00:10:24,160 --> 00:10:26,000
point down or is it something that can

291
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:28,880
organically grow from the bottoms up

292
00:10:28,880 --> 00:10:31,440
i think ideally both i think you want um

293
00:10:31,440 --> 00:10:32,079
sort of

294
00:10:32,079 --> 00:10:33,920
top-down backing and bottom-up backing

295
00:10:33,920 --> 00:10:35,760
but really what's the most important

296
00:10:35,760 --> 00:10:37,760
will depend on your organization

297
00:10:37,760 --> 00:10:39,680
if you're a large old bureaucratic

298
00:10:39,680 --> 00:10:41,040
organization having

299
00:10:41,040 --> 00:10:43,440
executive buy-in and sponsorship is

300
00:10:43,440 --> 00:10:45,360
going to be the most important thing

301
00:10:45,360 --> 00:10:47,440
um especially when you're battling

302
00:10:47,440 --> 00:10:48,560
against different

303
00:10:48,560 --> 00:10:50,640
you know different priorities which are

304
00:10:50,640 --> 00:10:52,560
potentially still in some degree

305
00:10:52,560 --> 00:10:55,839
siloed um and not completely aligned so

306
00:10:55,839 --> 00:10:57,279
uh you know things like you know

307
00:10:57,279 --> 00:10:59,440
security is not gonna unfortunately

308
00:10:59,440 --> 00:11:00,800
not going to be the top priority for

309
00:11:00,800 --> 00:11:02,640
lots of development managers or program

310
00:11:02,640 --> 00:11:03,519
managers

311
00:11:03,519 --> 00:11:05,360
so having that you know that executive

312
00:11:05,360 --> 00:11:07,600
buying at the svp layer or the c-level

313
00:11:07,600 --> 00:11:09,440
is is going to be key to make sure that

314
00:11:09,440 --> 00:11:10,240
security work

315
00:11:10,240 --> 00:11:13,040
actually gets prioritized within the

316
00:11:13,040 --> 00:11:14,800
projects and they didn't sprints

317
00:11:14,800 --> 00:11:16,640
and but i think equally if you're a a

318
00:11:16,640 --> 00:11:20,320
small small company or a startup where

319
00:11:20,320 --> 00:11:21,839
basically what gets done is going to be

320
00:11:21,839 --> 00:11:23,680
driven by the engineers then you need to

321
00:11:23,680 --> 00:11:24,480
have that

322
00:11:24,480 --> 00:11:26,720
bottom-up appreciation and importance

323
00:11:26,720 --> 00:11:28,959
for security

324
00:11:28,959 --> 00:11:32,079
and so let's say um you know we want uh

325
00:11:32,079 --> 00:11:33,839
we have you know whether or not we have

326
00:11:33,839 --> 00:11:35,600
this exec buy in this

327
00:11:35,600 --> 00:11:37,519
you know let's say we do want to create

328
00:11:37,519 --> 00:11:40,079
um a security champions program from

329
00:11:40,079 --> 00:11:40,880
scratch

330
00:11:40,880 --> 00:11:44,800
um yash how do we how do we go about um

331
00:11:44,800 --> 00:11:46,399
setting this up from from you know

332
00:11:46,399 --> 00:11:48,800
ground zero do we do we try and roll out

333
00:11:48,800 --> 00:11:50,560
quickly do we try and look at just one

334
00:11:50,560 --> 00:11:51,200
team

335
00:11:51,200 --> 00:11:54,720
how do we start i would say you probably

336
00:11:54,720 --> 00:11:55,120
would

337
00:11:55,120 --> 00:11:57,360
be better off starting off with one

338
00:11:57,360 --> 00:12:00,240
organization as a poc in the company

339
00:12:00,240 --> 00:12:02,639
show the value of it build small

340
00:12:02,639 --> 00:12:04,880
celebrate smaller wins and then showcase

341
00:12:04,880 --> 00:12:06,160
that effort

342
00:12:06,160 --> 00:12:08,480
and if you can show metrics or data

343
00:12:08,480 --> 00:12:09,760
driven sort of

344
00:12:09,760 --> 00:12:12,160
quantification of the program saying we

345
00:12:12,160 --> 00:12:13,600
did the champions poc

346
00:12:13,600 --> 00:12:15,760
with these five teams this is what came

347
00:12:15,760 --> 00:12:17,760
out of it that's why this is better for

348
00:12:17,760 --> 00:12:19,680
the whole company and then use that to

349
00:12:19,680 --> 00:12:21,680
drive it across the company because

350
00:12:21,680 --> 00:12:23,040
eventually you need to show

351
00:12:23,040 --> 00:12:25,120
engineers and engineering leaders the

352
00:12:25,120 --> 00:12:26,399
value

353
00:12:26,399 --> 00:12:28,639
you get from engineers dedicating time

354
00:12:28,639 --> 00:12:30,000
to this program

355
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:33,360
if you are able to prove

356
00:12:33,360 --> 00:12:36,480
with data that a statement saying please

357
00:12:36,480 --> 00:12:37,200
dedicate

358
00:12:37,200 --> 00:12:39,360
x percent of your engineering resources

359
00:12:39,360 --> 00:12:41,519
to a champions program and this will be

360
00:12:41,519 --> 00:12:42,240
the result

361
00:12:42,240 --> 00:12:44,639
across the company i think that makes a

362
00:12:44,639 --> 00:12:46,560
solid statement

363
00:12:46,560 --> 00:12:49,760
do you feel do you feel um obviously if

364
00:12:49,760 --> 00:12:51,680
you start with one group and then

365
00:12:51,680 --> 00:12:54,959
slowly gradually grow over time

366
00:12:54,959 --> 00:12:56,639
do you feel there is an expectation a

367
00:12:56,639 --> 00:12:58,000
faster expectation

368
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:00,399
from an exact level or a management

369
00:13:00,399 --> 00:13:01,200
level about

370
00:13:01,200 --> 00:13:02,959
growing this faster or do you find that

371
00:13:02,959 --> 00:13:04,800
typically sympathetic to the speed at

372
00:13:04,800 --> 00:13:05,279
which

373
00:13:05,279 --> 00:13:08,399
this can realistically be rolled out i

374
00:13:08,399 --> 00:13:09,200
think that

375
00:13:09,200 --> 00:13:11,600
it's pretty much different per company

376
00:13:11,600 --> 00:13:13,760
right like if there is exact buy-in and

377
00:13:13,760 --> 00:13:16,399
you're talking about uh something that

378
00:13:16,399 --> 00:13:18,000
needs to be rolled out then that's a

379
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:20,399
very different pace versus the other

380
00:13:20,399 --> 00:13:21,760
bottoms up approach where you're trying

381
00:13:21,760 --> 00:13:24,160
to show value and grow it organically

382
00:13:24,160 --> 00:13:27,440
so it varies on what the

383
00:13:27,440 --> 00:13:30,079
security philosophy is and what the

384
00:13:30,079 --> 00:13:34,639
appetite for security eventually is

385
00:13:34,639 --> 00:13:36,880
cool let me jump into the details then

386
00:13:36,880 --> 00:13:37,760
about what

387
00:13:37,760 --> 00:13:41,040
um how a security champions program

388
00:13:41,040 --> 00:13:42,800
looks and and what are the kinds of

389
00:13:42,800 --> 00:13:44,399
activities um

390
00:13:44,399 --> 00:13:47,920
that that we can jump into so um marissa

391
00:13:47,920 --> 00:13:49,440
why don't we talk about the structure of

392
00:13:49,440 --> 00:13:50,560
a group how have you

393
00:13:50,560 --> 00:13:53,040
how are you typically structured groups

394
00:13:53,040 --> 00:13:53,920
you mentioned

395
00:13:53,920 --> 00:13:56,240
about having individuals on both sides

396
00:13:56,240 --> 00:13:56,959
how does it look

397
00:13:56,959 --> 00:14:00,079
uh from a structured point of view

398
00:14:00,079 --> 00:14:03,120
um i think that the structure

399
00:14:03,120 --> 00:14:05,040
obviously can vary every program is

400
00:14:05,040 --> 00:14:07,199
different and so you take

401
00:14:07,199 --> 00:14:10,160
the pieces that are going to best suit

402
00:14:10,160 --> 00:14:11,920
your culture

403
00:14:11,920 --> 00:14:14,959
um so a

404
00:14:14,959 --> 00:14:16,800
setup that i've seen in a couple of

405
00:14:16,800 --> 00:14:18,160
places is

406
00:14:18,160 --> 00:14:21,600
having a process for identifying who

407
00:14:21,600 --> 00:14:23,920
your security champions should be

408
00:14:23,920 --> 00:14:27,360
and a decision

409
00:14:27,360 --> 00:14:28,959
are you going to make this a requirement

410
00:14:28,959 --> 00:14:30,880
at some level for teams to participate

411
00:14:30,880 --> 00:14:31,839
or not

412
00:14:31,839 --> 00:14:35,760
um my the most successful programs i've

413
00:14:35,760 --> 00:14:36,160
run

414
00:14:36,160 --> 00:14:38,800
have sort of a requirement in there and

415
00:14:38,800 --> 00:14:40,480
as a result of that your security

416
00:14:40,480 --> 00:14:41,760
champions are

417
00:14:41,760 --> 00:14:44,959
nominated by a manager from their team

418
00:14:44,959 --> 00:14:48,079
and you're looking um in in the more

419
00:14:48,079 --> 00:14:49,760
mature stages of your program you're

420
00:14:49,760 --> 00:14:50,800
looking for

421
00:14:50,800 --> 00:14:52,720
like a hundred percent adoption from all

422
00:14:52,720 --> 00:14:54,320
the teams

423
00:14:54,320 --> 00:14:56,959
so you're really needing a way to make

424
00:14:56,959 --> 00:14:58,399
the program official

425
00:14:58,399 --> 00:15:01,040
so that it can be handed to people

426
00:15:01,040 --> 00:15:02,320
rolled out the requirements are

427
00:15:02,320 --> 00:15:03,519
understood

428
00:15:03,519 --> 00:15:06,639
and there's sort of a list of roles and

429
00:15:06,639 --> 00:15:08,240
responsibilities

430
00:15:08,240 --> 00:15:10,399
and then you've got your listings and

431
00:15:10,399 --> 00:15:11,600
responsibilities

432
00:15:11,600 --> 00:15:13,760
do not deviate from that list don't

433
00:15:13,760 --> 00:15:14,639
scope creep

434
00:15:14,639 --> 00:15:17,519
and you know stop by the desk here and

435
00:15:17,519 --> 00:15:19,519
there and say oh and also there's this

436
00:15:19,519 --> 00:15:20,320
program

437
00:15:20,320 --> 00:15:23,360
and could we add this to the list

438
00:15:23,360 --> 00:15:26,079
the the element of trust is really

439
00:15:26,079 --> 00:15:27,279
important between

440
00:15:27,279 --> 00:15:30,639
the security champions and the uh

441
00:15:30,639 --> 00:15:34,320
security team that is

442
00:15:34,639 --> 00:15:38,480
sponsoring uh so having a very

443
00:15:38,480 --> 00:15:42,160
set structure is the most important part

444
00:15:42,160 --> 00:15:44,560
and then from there you can have either

445
00:15:44,560 --> 00:15:46,000
a

446
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:48,800
one-to-one setup or you can do

447
00:15:48,800 --> 00:15:49,759
one-to-many

448
00:15:49,759 --> 00:15:51,759
so in this sense in the example where

449
00:15:51,759 --> 00:15:53,360
you have a program manager

450
00:15:53,360 --> 00:15:55,920
there's one program manager and that one

451
00:15:55,920 --> 00:15:58,240
program manager would support

452
00:15:58,240 --> 00:16:01,279
uh one to a dozen product security

453
00:16:01,279 --> 00:16:02,320
engineers and then

454
00:16:02,320 --> 00:16:04,320
those one to a dozen product security

455
00:16:04,320 --> 00:16:06,000
engineers each themselves

456
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:09,199
support one to five

457
00:16:09,199 --> 00:16:12,000
uh security champions and that's sort of

458
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:13,519
a pyramid structure

459
00:16:13,519 --> 00:16:16,639
uh and i find that that has the best

460
00:16:16,639 --> 00:16:21,120
leverage to get real relationships built

461
00:16:21,120 --> 00:16:23,360
people that know actual people and it's

462
00:16:23,360 --> 00:16:24,800
not just

463
00:16:24,800 --> 00:16:28,560
the security team as a whole kind of a

464
00:16:28,560 --> 00:16:32,079
um you know without a face

465
00:16:32,079 --> 00:16:35,120
so having personal relationships

466
00:16:35,120 --> 00:16:36,480
of course when you're trying to build a

467
00:16:36,480 --> 00:16:38,880
culture program it's all about

468
00:16:38,880 --> 00:16:40,480
people getting to know people and

469
00:16:40,480 --> 00:16:42,480
helping each other and

470
00:16:42,480 --> 00:16:45,279
in my experience when a security

471
00:16:45,279 --> 00:16:45,839
champion

472
00:16:45,839 --> 00:16:48,800
is deciding just how much energy and

473
00:16:48,800 --> 00:16:50,079
effort they're going to put into a

474
00:16:50,079 --> 00:16:50,800
program

475
00:16:50,800 --> 00:16:53,120
it often does come down to a personal

476
00:16:53,120 --> 00:16:54,000
connection

477
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:57,279
to the goals and to the program

478
00:16:57,279 --> 00:16:58,959
so those sorts of things can be built

479
00:16:58,959 --> 00:17:02,639
and intentionally supported and nurtured

480
00:17:02,639 --> 00:17:04,640
very interesting one one point that you

481
00:17:04,640 --> 00:17:06,480
mentioned that that kind of like uh

482
00:17:06,480 --> 00:17:08,240
i was very interested there early on was

483
00:17:08,240 --> 00:17:09,839
the was the

484
00:17:09,839 --> 00:17:12,240
the coverage that you've got obviously

485
00:17:12,240 --> 00:17:13,839
is probably close to or if not

486
00:17:13,839 --> 00:17:16,559
100 across atlassian right if you have

487
00:17:16,559 --> 00:17:17,439
if you

488
00:17:17,439 --> 00:17:20,240
if it's more people get um it's almost

489
00:17:20,240 --> 00:17:21,439
like selected

490
00:17:21,439 --> 00:17:23,599
uh by their management organization to

491
00:17:23,599 --> 00:17:25,199
be a part of that team

492
00:17:25,199 --> 00:17:27,839
uh or presumably the manager will ask

493
00:17:27,839 --> 00:17:29,600
people if they're interested in if

494
00:17:29,600 --> 00:17:31,360
you know if someone's there that's

495
00:17:31,360 --> 00:17:32,960
that's desperate to be in it they'll

496
00:17:32,960 --> 00:17:33,520
they'll

497
00:17:33,520 --> 00:17:35,840
they'll give it to that person how how

498
00:17:35,840 --> 00:17:37,679
do you see that working in terms of pros

499
00:17:37,679 --> 00:17:38,880
and cons of it being

500
00:17:38,880 --> 00:17:42,720
more organic opt-in versus the managers

501
00:17:42,720 --> 00:17:45,600
uh designating this uh security champion

502
00:17:45,600 --> 00:17:48,320
to individuals

503
00:17:48,320 --> 00:17:51,840
um well the pro is that you're

504
00:17:51,840 --> 00:17:55,200
solving for one of the biggest issues

505
00:17:55,200 --> 00:17:58,480
in the security space which is

506
00:17:58,480 --> 00:18:01,440
scale and you're getting better scale

507
00:18:01,440 --> 00:18:02,640
better coverage

508
00:18:02,640 --> 00:18:05,600
of your landscape and code base by

509
00:18:05,600 --> 00:18:06,160
actually

510
00:18:06,160 --> 00:18:10,000
having somebody on the ground in each

511
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:13,280
coding you know each development team so

512
00:18:13,280 --> 00:18:14,640
coverage is kind of

513
00:18:14,640 --> 00:18:18,400
uh it's the starting goal it's the

514
00:18:18,400 --> 00:18:20,640
reason for the program as far as the

515
00:18:20,640 --> 00:18:22,720
security team is concerned

516
00:18:22,720 --> 00:18:26,400
um and then on the

517
00:18:26,400 --> 00:18:28,960
kind of expensive side i won't call it a

518
00:18:28,960 --> 00:18:29,679
negative

519
00:18:29,679 --> 00:18:32,720
is the just the amount of work that is

520
00:18:32,720 --> 00:18:33,520
required

521
00:18:33,520 --> 00:18:36,240
also expands exponentially when you're

522
00:18:36,240 --> 00:18:37,280
involving more people

523
00:18:37,280 --> 00:18:40,960
you need to create a um experience for

524
00:18:40,960 --> 00:18:42,240
each of these people

525
00:18:42,240 --> 00:18:45,520
and when you have more types of personas

526
00:18:45,520 --> 00:18:48,160
in your group you have to create more uh

527
00:18:48,160 --> 00:18:49,600
you have to broaden

528
00:18:49,600 --> 00:18:52,400
your experience so that it fits more

529
00:18:52,400 --> 00:18:54,880
types of

530
00:18:55,600 --> 00:18:58,720
how does roles absolutely how does this

531
00:18:58,720 --> 00:19:00,080
contrast with um

532
00:19:00,080 --> 00:19:03,120
uh josh nick your your programs are they

533
00:19:03,120 --> 00:19:04,400
are they similarly built

534
00:19:04,400 --> 00:19:08,400
um i think one of the key requirements

535
00:19:08,400 --> 00:19:10,000
for us in terms of the effectiveness

536
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:12,320
of the of the security champion as if

537
00:19:12,320 --> 00:19:14,400
they're already a contributing member of

538
00:19:14,400 --> 00:19:14,960
that team

539
00:19:14,960 --> 00:19:17,360
um really important for them to be able

540
00:19:17,360 --> 00:19:19,520
to to be able to independently

541
00:19:19,520 --> 00:19:21,280
now to make changes and push them

542
00:19:21,280 --> 00:19:22,559
through

543
00:19:22,559 --> 00:19:24,400
you know pipelines and get them deployed

544
00:19:24,400 --> 00:19:26,160
into into production for those

545
00:19:26,160 --> 00:19:28,320
products um where we've had problems is

546
00:19:28,320 --> 00:19:29,840
where you know a team has been kind of

547
00:19:29,840 --> 00:19:31,520
identified they need to have a security

548
00:19:31,520 --> 00:19:33,919
champion and try to bring in an external

549
00:19:33,919 --> 00:19:36,320
or new resource and then it still takes

550
00:19:36,320 --> 00:19:38,080
time to get them familiar up and running

551
00:19:38,080 --> 00:19:39,039
with that team

552
00:19:39,039 --> 00:19:41,120
so i think existing contributing members

553
00:19:41,120 --> 00:19:43,360
of those teams is the most effective way

554
00:19:43,360 --> 00:19:45,919
to do this um just a quick comment on on

555
00:19:45,919 --> 00:19:47,440
cost as well i think

556
00:19:47,440 --> 00:19:48,720
it's actually you know security

557
00:19:48,720 --> 00:19:50,480
champions program it depends on your

558
00:19:50,480 --> 00:19:52,080
company's attitude to security but if

559
00:19:52,080 --> 00:19:52,960
you know it's something which is

560
00:19:52,960 --> 00:19:54,160
important you need to do

561
00:19:54,160 --> 00:19:56,799
it's actually a cost saying saving

562
00:19:56,799 --> 00:19:57,520
mechanism

563
00:19:57,520 --> 00:20:00,160
because i presumably you started out

564
00:20:00,160 --> 00:20:01,919
with a security engineering function

565
00:20:01,919 --> 00:20:04,559
but scaling up hiring security engineers

566
00:20:04,559 --> 00:20:06,720
embedding them in each team is just it's

567
00:20:06,720 --> 00:20:07,760
not practical

568
00:20:07,760 --> 00:20:10,960
definitely not cost effective um i think

569
00:20:10,960 --> 00:20:13,679
it's also easier to to have an effective

570
00:20:13,679 --> 00:20:15,120
security champions program

571
00:20:15,120 --> 00:20:17,440
if you've already started that

572
00:20:17,440 --> 00:20:19,360
initiative and start having that

573
00:20:19,360 --> 00:20:21,440
existing security engineering function

574
00:20:21,440 --> 00:20:23,440
and have done it on a smaller scale by

575
00:20:23,440 --> 00:20:25,600
embedding security engineers into teams

576
00:20:25,600 --> 00:20:26,720
or liaising between

577
00:20:26,720 --> 00:20:28,320
different teams because you'll already

578
00:20:28,320 --> 00:20:30,080
have your engagement model so you'll

579
00:20:30,080 --> 00:20:30,880
understand you'll

580
00:20:30,880 --> 00:20:34,080
set up what that ssdlc looks like and

581
00:20:34,080 --> 00:20:36,080
that makes it much easier to put into an

582
00:20:36,080 --> 00:20:36,480
easy

583
00:20:36,480 --> 00:20:38,880
training package to roll out and teach

584
00:20:38,880 --> 00:20:42,400
the security champions

585
00:20:43,520 --> 00:20:46,080
very similar i told you i'll add on top

586
00:20:46,080 --> 00:20:49,840
of both what marissa and nick said

587
00:20:49,919 --> 00:20:52,000
the individuals who become champions it

588
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:54,000
is sort of semi

589
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:57,440
uh voluntary plus manager-led as well

590
00:20:57,440 --> 00:21:00,320
a couple of soft requirements that we

591
00:21:00,320 --> 00:21:00,799
have

592
00:21:00,799 --> 00:21:02,880
is that they should have been a part of

593
00:21:02,880 --> 00:21:04,559
the team to what makes it that they

594
00:21:04,559 --> 00:21:06,159
should have been somebody who knows how

595
00:21:06,159 --> 00:21:08,320
things are deployed how things are built

596
00:21:08,320 --> 00:21:10,559
the other thing that we ask is the

597
00:21:10,559 --> 00:21:12,799
member is not like a very junior member

598
00:21:12,799 --> 00:21:14,240
of the team because

599
00:21:14,240 --> 00:21:16,480
if it's a senior or semi-senior member

600
00:21:16,480 --> 00:21:18,480
they know what other members of that

601
00:21:18,480 --> 00:21:20,480
engineering team are working on

602
00:21:20,480 --> 00:21:22,799
whereas some of the junior teams may not

603
00:21:22,799 --> 00:21:24,400
have as much visibility

604
00:21:24,400 --> 00:21:26,720
to be able to represent all the work

605
00:21:26,720 --> 00:21:27,919
being done by

606
00:21:27,919 --> 00:21:30,240
the whole team from a security

607
00:21:30,240 --> 00:21:32,400
perspective so that's the slight change

608
00:21:32,400 --> 00:21:33,360
that i would

609
00:21:33,360 --> 00:21:36,240
uh point out that we do here at julia a

610
00:21:36,240 --> 00:21:38,400
couple of other things that we do

611
00:21:38,400 --> 00:21:40,240
very similarly but a little differently

612
00:21:40,240 --> 00:21:42,400
here is we don't have a program

613
00:21:42,400 --> 00:21:43,600
management support

614
00:21:43,600 --> 00:21:45,760
which agreed is nice to have but we have

615
00:21:45,760 --> 00:21:47,679
been running a program where we don't

616
00:21:47,679 --> 00:21:50,880
uh have that yet we have security

617
00:21:50,880 --> 00:21:52,559
engineers dedicating or

618
00:21:52,559 --> 00:21:54,320
specifically product security engineers

619
00:21:54,320 --> 00:21:56,080
dedicating around 40

620
00:21:56,080 --> 00:21:58,640
of their time towards champions and from

621
00:21:58,640 --> 00:22:00,400
these champions like a lot of reviews

622
00:22:00,400 --> 00:22:02,240
sort of stemmed down right threat models

623
00:22:02,240 --> 00:22:04,080
code reviews pinterest and so on so

624
00:22:04,080 --> 00:22:05,600
forth

625
00:22:05,600 --> 00:22:07,280
from the engineering perspective to

626
00:22:07,280 --> 00:22:09,039
marissa's point it's very important to

627
00:22:09,039 --> 00:22:10,159
document

628
00:22:10,159 --> 00:22:12,080
the set of responsibilities that's

629
00:22:12,080 --> 00:22:13,360
expected from both

630
00:22:13,360 --> 00:22:15,200
the champion and the security engineer

631
00:22:15,200 --> 00:22:16,880
who's their point of contact

632
00:22:16,880 --> 00:22:18,799
and then set those expectations to the

633
00:22:18,799 --> 00:22:20,480
engineer to the engineering leadership

634
00:22:20,480 --> 00:22:20,960
saying

635
00:22:20,960 --> 00:22:23,200
this is what we expect of a champion we

636
00:22:23,200 --> 00:22:24,720
estimate that to take

637
00:22:24,720 --> 00:22:27,600
10 15 of the engineers time and this is

638
00:22:27,600 --> 00:22:28,320
what

639
00:22:28,320 --> 00:22:30,880
uh we get out of that and to stick to

640
00:22:30,880 --> 00:22:33,280
that and not have a scope creep

641
00:22:33,280 --> 00:22:35,120
and that's that's why you need the

642
00:22:35,120 --> 00:22:36,720
executive support right to be able to

643
00:22:36,720 --> 00:22:37,200
say

644
00:22:37,200 --> 00:22:41,679
we want 10 15 20 has anyone experienced

645
00:22:41,679 --> 00:22:44,400
champions programs where you haven't

646
00:22:44,400 --> 00:22:45,600
been able to get that

647
00:22:45,600 --> 00:22:50,719
agreed 10 20 from a developer's time

648
00:22:50,799 --> 00:22:54,000
we haven't had the exact problem but

649
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:56,080
we need to keep showing value from the

650
00:22:56,080 --> 00:22:58,240
program in order to keep that question

651
00:22:58,240 --> 00:22:58,559
from

652
00:22:58,559 --> 00:23:00,799
raising up i don't think you can always

653
00:23:00,799 --> 00:23:02,720
keep going like okay give us 10

654
00:23:02,720 --> 00:23:05,120
of your time but we'll never quantify or

655
00:23:05,120 --> 00:23:05,919
show

656
00:23:05,919 --> 00:23:08,000
what's happening to it so in terms of

657
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:09,679
metrics number of threat models that

658
00:23:09,679 --> 00:23:11,440
come up code reviews like if you can

659
00:23:11,440 --> 00:23:12,640
quantify

660
00:23:12,640 --> 00:23:14,960
what activities are being performed and

661
00:23:14,960 --> 00:23:16,159
what that eventually

662
00:23:16,159 --> 00:23:19,360
leads to as an example you could say

663
00:23:19,360 --> 00:23:21,840
we did a champions program with two orgs

664
00:23:21,840 --> 00:23:24,320
or two business units that led to

665
00:23:24,320 --> 00:23:27,120
x percent higher threat model findings

666
00:23:27,120 --> 00:23:29,440
compared to the other organizations

667
00:23:29,440 --> 00:23:31,760
in which we had more pentester bug money

668
00:23:31,760 --> 00:23:34,000
submissions and sort of correlate those

669
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:36,880
and say we're finding issues faster and

670
00:23:36,880 --> 00:23:37,360
uh

671
00:23:37,360 --> 00:23:40,640
before in the sdlc cycle versus later

672
00:23:40,640 --> 00:23:42,080
after release and

673
00:23:42,080 --> 00:23:44,400
the difference is one has a beefed up

674
00:23:44,400 --> 00:23:46,400
champions program and the other doesn't

675
00:23:46,400 --> 00:23:51,360
i think that's how you get that bike

676
00:23:51,360 --> 00:23:54,320
so now let's talk a little bit about the

677
00:23:54,320 --> 00:23:55,679
activities that actually

678
00:23:55,679 --> 00:23:59,279
occur in in a champions program or at

679
00:23:59,279 --> 00:24:00,159
least between the

680
00:24:00,159 --> 00:24:02,640
the champions and their their

681
00:24:02,640 --> 00:24:04,559
equivalence coaches or mavens or

682
00:24:04,559 --> 00:24:07,760
um uh i had no trainers or however we

683
00:24:07,760 --> 00:24:10,080
choose to call them on the security side

684
00:24:10,080 --> 00:24:12,080
um there are going to be regular

685
00:24:12,080 --> 00:24:13,679
activities that have a cadence and there

686
00:24:13,679 --> 00:24:15,039
are going to be activities that just

687
00:24:15,039 --> 00:24:16,000
generally happen

688
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:18,559
um marissa what what in atlassian what

689
00:24:18,559 --> 00:24:20,799
what are the types of activities that

690
00:24:20,799 --> 00:24:23,520
are are structured um versus other

691
00:24:23,520 --> 00:24:24,559
activities that

692
00:24:24,559 --> 00:24:26,960
that you've seen happen as a result of

693
00:24:26,960 --> 00:24:30,559
just having a champions program there

694
00:24:31,520 --> 00:24:35,600
um so having the security champions

695
00:24:35,600 --> 00:24:38,799
take on more of the security team's

696
00:24:38,799 --> 00:24:40,159
responsibilities

697
00:24:40,159 --> 00:24:42,640
um anytime that you can add one of those

698
00:24:42,640 --> 00:24:43,520
practices

699
00:24:43,520 --> 00:24:45,840
to the security champion set because

700
00:24:45,840 --> 00:24:47,520
it's matured in a way that it

701
00:24:47,520 --> 00:24:50,880
is uh documented and understandable

702
00:24:50,880 --> 00:24:53,760
then and anyone that is close to the

703
00:24:53,760 --> 00:24:54,159
code

704
00:24:54,159 --> 00:24:56,159
could run those operations that's gonna

705
00:24:56,159 --> 00:24:57,440
be much better

706
00:24:57,440 --> 00:25:01,120
so having um first of all starting with

707
00:25:01,120 --> 00:25:02,080
training

708
00:25:02,080 --> 00:25:05,120
uh a set baseline training and then we

709
00:25:05,120 --> 00:25:07,120
see that kind of as the

710
00:25:07,120 --> 00:25:10,320
kind of a driver's license and

711
00:25:10,320 --> 00:25:13,360
the driver's license training to get the

712
00:25:13,360 --> 00:25:14,159
keys

713
00:25:14,159 --> 00:25:17,679
to getting uh firsthand and therefore a

714
00:25:17,679 --> 00:25:19,200
shorter timeline

715
00:25:19,200 --> 00:25:21,840
uh first-hand experience with running

716
00:25:21,840 --> 00:25:23,120
some of these security

717
00:25:23,120 --> 00:25:26,400
um security testing operations so

718
00:25:26,400 --> 00:25:29,440
uh having a some amount of security

719
00:25:29,440 --> 00:25:30,240
testing

720
00:25:30,240 --> 00:25:32,240
scanning those sorts of things and then

721
00:25:32,240 --> 00:25:33,440
those generate

722
00:25:33,440 --> 00:25:36,480
the vulnerabilities uh if you can

723
00:25:36,480 --> 00:25:36,960
include

724
00:25:36,960 --> 00:25:40,640
some first level triage and

725
00:25:40,640 --> 00:25:42,480
remediation of the vulnerabilities

726
00:25:42,480 --> 00:25:44,320
themselves uh

727
00:25:44,320 --> 00:25:47,120
imagine the time you can save by cutting

728
00:25:47,120 --> 00:25:47,760
down

729
00:25:47,760 --> 00:25:50,880
the um when

730
00:25:50,880 --> 00:25:54,000
so you have a vulnerability in the code

731
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:55,679
and keeping it with the developer

732
00:25:55,679 --> 00:25:57,200
keeping it with the code's owner

733
00:25:57,200 --> 00:25:59,200
and not having it travel all the way

734
00:25:59,200 --> 00:26:00,880
across

735
00:26:00,880 --> 00:26:03,679
the world sometimes to the security team

736
00:26:03,679 --> 00:26:05,520
having them look at it and then sending

737
00:26:05,520 --> 00:26:06,400
it back

738
00:26:06,400 --> 00:26:10,159
for um and remediation it's

739
00:26:10,159 --> 00:26:13,440
saving a lot of time there so uh taking

740
00:26:13,440 --> 00:26:14,640
the

741
00:26:14,640 --> 00:26:18,000
um some of those security activities

742
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:21,200
also looking at threat modeling um this

743
00:26:21,200 --> 00:26:22,720
is a lightweight threat model

744
00:26:22,720 --> 00:26:25,120
not necessarily that same level that a

745
00:26:25,120 --> 00:26:26,640
security professional would be able to

746
00:26:26,640 --> 00:26:27,520
deliver

747
00:26:27,520 --> 00:26:30,080
but when we notice a pattern that is

748
00:26:30,080 --> 00:26:31,279
consistent across

749
00:26:31,279 --> 00:26:33,840
many of the teams that's something that

750
00:26:33,840 --> 00:26:35,039
we can build into

751
00:26:35,039 --> 00:26:37,679
a lightweight security champion

752
00:26:37,679 --> 00:26:38,720
customized

753
00:26:38,720 --> 00:26:40,400
threat modeling process that they can

754
00:26:40,400 --> 00:26:42,480
run in the beginning and

755
00:26:42,480 --> 00:26:45,520
during the life cycle of their code

756
00:26:45,520 --> 00:26:47,600
and it really helps to again just

757
00:26:47,600 --> 00:26:49,760
shorten the amount of time that each

758
00:26:49,760 --> 00:26:52,559
code set has to be dealing with the

759
00:26:52,559 --> 00:26:54,400
security process

760
00:26:54,400 --> 00:26:58,880
um and then also see

761
00:27:00,400 --> 00:27:02,960
um and then there is an official amount

762
00:27:02,960 --> 00:27:03,520
of

763
00:27:03,520 --> 00:27:06,480
kind of community interaction that is an

764
00:27:06,480 --> 00:27:08,000
expectation is set for

765
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:10,159
so we have a monthly meeting and there

766
00:27:10,159 --> 00:27:11,279
is an expectation

767
00:27:11,279 --> 00:27:12,880
that you will participate in the monthly

768
00:27:12,880 --> 00:27:15,039
meeting and participate in all of the

769
00:27:15,039 --> 00:27:16,880
conversations around

770
00:27:16,880 --> 00:27:19,360
uh tickets and incidents that are set

771
00:27:19,360 --> 00:27:20,000
for your

772
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:22,480
team so that is another piece that's

773
00:27:22,480 --> 00:27:23,279
kind of

774
00:27:23,279 --> 00:27:24,880
uh and there's an official expectation

775
00:27:24,880 --> 00:27:27,039
that is uh time spent

776
00:27:27,039 --> 00:27:28,720
and what is that monthly meeting is that

777
00:27:28,720 --> 00:27:30,240
is that kind of like a sync meeting

778
00:27:30,240 --> 00:27:30,799
between

779
00:27:30,799 --> 00:27:33,039
champions or a way for the security team

780
00:27:33,039 --> 00:27:34,240
to communicate

781
00:27:34,240 --> 00:27:36,159
through throughout the community what's

782
00:27:36,159 --> 00:27:37,360
the

783
00:27:37,360 --> 00:27:39,760
content of those yeah there's

784
00:27:39,760 --> 00:27:40,720
announcements

785
00:27:40,720 --> 00:27:42,399
anything that needs to be communicated

786
00:27:42,399 --> 00:27:44,159
about changes to the program

787
00:27:44,159 --> 00:27:46,960
so that kind of level of speaking to

788
00:27:46,960 --> 00:27:48,000
everyone all at once

789
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:50,080
is really helpful to have once a month

790
00:27:50,080 --> 00:27:51,200
but then there's also

791
00:27:51,200 --> 00:27:54,320
um that is one of the opportunities for

792
00:27:54,320 --> 00:27:55,200
training

793
00:27:55,200 --> 00:27:58,559
and maybe there's a vulnerability of the

794
00:27:58,559 --> 00:27:59,120
month

795
00:27:59,120 --> 00:28:02,720
and we are just running through

796
00:28:02,720 --> 00:28:04,960
taking one vulnerability class at a time

797
00:28:04,960 --> 00:28:06,640
and running through

798
00:28:06,640 --> 00:28:10,000
examples of real examples of the

799
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:12,080
vulnerability in our code base

800
00:28:12,080 --> 00:28:15,200
and then also

801
00:28:15,200 --> 00:28:16,960
there's an expectation that security

802
00:28:16,960 --> 00:28:19,200
champions themselves will teach back

803
00:28:19,200 --> 00:28:22,320
and present at this same meeting um

804
00:28:22,320 --> 00:28:24,960
so when they're finding interesting bugs

805
00:28:24,960 --> 00:28:25,840
themselves

806
00:28:25,840 --> 00:28:27,760
this is the opportunity to showcase

807
00:28:27,760 --> 00:28:29,200
their work and improvement

808
00:28:29,200 --> 00:28:31,600
and how they're growing as security

809
00:28:31,600 --> 00:28:33,360
champions as well so we get a lot done

810
00:28:33,360 --> 00:28:34,720
in that one monthly meeting

811
00:28:34,720 --> 00:28:37,919
yeah sounds good nick i know you do like

812
00:28:37,919 --> 00:28:39,840
um school card assessments and things

813
00:28:39,840 --> 00:28:41,919
like that is that part of the um

814
00:28:41,919 --> 00:28:44,480
security champions program yeah so yeah

815
00:28:44,480 --> 00:28:45,840
so i think that's the

816
00:28:45,840 --> 00:28:47,840
thing i think it's really important to

817
00:28:47,840 --> 00:28:49,760
clearly define what it is that we're

818
00:28:49,760 --> 00:28:51,520
asking the security champions to do and

819
00:28:51,520 --> 00:28:53,279
what their responsibilities are

820
00:28:53,279 --> 00:28:56,159
um so part of that will be um yeah

821
00:28:56,159 --> 00:28:58,080
filling out filling out scorecards for

822
00:28:58,080 --> 00:28:58,480
the

823
00:28:58,480 --> 00:29:01,279
um yeah for the the operational security

824
00:29:01,279 --> 00:29:02,559
testing stats

825
00:29:02,559 --> 00:29:04,720
um i think first and foremost and there

826
00:29:04,720 --> 00:29:06,000
is you know what i think the

827
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:08,159
responsibility is is to help the team in

828
00:29:08,159 --> 00:29:09,360
identifying what

829
00:29:09,360 --> 00:29:11,039
the security requirements are for new

830
00:29:11,039 --> 00:29:12,720
functionality coming in

831
00:29:12,720 --> 00:29:15,360
um so they'll be doing that by threat

832
00:29:15,360 --> 00:29:16,240
modeling

833
00:29:16,240 --> 00:29:18,559
um and that's how our security team will

834
00:29:18,559 --> 00:29:20,320
help ease them into that by

835
00:29:20,320 --> 00:29:21,919
you know one of the security engineers

836
00:29:21,919 --> 00:29:23,520
will carry out the initial threat model

837
00:29:23,520 --> 00:29:24,000
for the

838
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:25,679
for whatever that application or product

839
00:29:25,679 --> 00:29:27,600
is um but then

840
00:29:27,600 --> 00:29:29,679
train the security champion in that

841
00:29:29,679 --> 00:29:31,520
threat modeling process so that as

842
00:29:31,520 --> 00:29:33,120
new functionality is added they can go

843
00:29:33,120 --> 00:29:35,120
and update that through a model with uh

844
00:29:35,120 --> 00:29:37,120
with with any new security threats and

845
00:29:37,120 --> 00:29:38,559
requirements um

846
00:29:38,559 --> 00:29:41,440
becomes much more manageable um

847
00:29:41,440 --> 00:29:42,320
alongside

848
00:29:42,320 --> 00:29:45,520
um you know supporting all of the

849
00:29:45,520 --> 00:29:47,840
the team with all of the security

850
00:29:47,840 --> 00:29:50,000
detection and remediation activities

851
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:51,919
um which is why you're training them in

852
00:29:51,919 --> 00:29:55,600
how to triage um

853
00:29:55,600 --> 00:29:58,159
static analysis and dependency scanning

854
00:29:58,159 --> 00:30:00,240
results dynamic analysis and turn those

855
00:30:00,240 --> 00:30:01,440
into bodies

856
00:30:01,440 --> 00:30:03,120
a body of work for the team to be able

857
00:30:03,120 --> 00:30:05,279
to implement or have the security

858
00:30:05,279 --> 00:30:09,600
champions go and implement it themselves

859
00:30:09,600 --> 00:30:11,279
anything to add there yes is that is it

860
00:30:11,279 --> 00:30:13,520
similar similar at twilio

861
00:30:13,520 --> 00:30:16,159
uh pretty similar what we do is we have

862
00:30:16,159 --> 00:30:18,080
documentation of who's the security

863
00:30:18,080 --> 00:30:19,840
champion for which team and who's the

864
00:30:19,840 --> 00:30:20,640
dedicated

865
00:30:20,640 --> 00:30:23,840
security partner we also have a wiki

866
00:30:23,840 --> 00:30:25,440
page that shows

867
00:30:25,440 --> 00:30:27,600
the work that's pending on the

868
00:30:27,600 --> 00:30:30,000
champion's team's

869
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:32,000
side of from security activities and

870
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:34,159
also from the security team of the

871
00:30:34,159 --> 00:30:36,480
activities that are that they are

872
00:30:36,480 --> 00:30:38,559
performing for that particular team so

873
00:30:38,559 --> 00:30:40,000
the security champions

874
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:42,640
sort of uh widget of tickets could be

875
00:30:42,640 --> 00:30:43,360
fix x

876
00:30:43,360 --> 00:30:45,440
x y fix z and on the security side it

877
00:30:45,440 --> 00:30:46,960
could be do a threat model

878
00:30:46,960 --> 00:30:49,039
go look at this go review this pr so

879
00:30:49,039 --> 00:30:50,000
it's kind of

880
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:52,000
holding each other accountable uh

881
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:53,600
engineering team saying hey champion we

882
00:30:53,600 --> 00:30:55,039
need your team to do these five

883
00:30:55,039 --> 00:30:57,120
activities and from the flip side

884
00:30:57,120 --> 00:30:59,519
a security engineer since you're our poc

885
00:30:59,519 --> 00:31:01,200
i need you to do these three activities

886
00:31:01,200 --> 00:31:02,880
for me right so it kind of keeps that

887
00:31:02,880 --> 00:31:04,480
visibility going

888
00:31:04,480 --> 00:31:07,120
we also have a slack channel per

889
00:31:07,120 --> 00:31:08,720
security champion

890
00:31:08,720 --> 00:31:10,720
security engineer working relationship

891
00:31:10,720 --> 00:31:13,200
because what we found out was

892
00:31:13,200 --> 00:31:14,880
people move teams people move

893
00:31:14,880 --> 00:31:16,720
organizations pretty fast and then that

894
00:31:16,720 --> 00:31:19,039
context is lost so having one place

895
00:31:19,039 --> 00:31:19,679
where

896
00:31:19,679 --> 00:31:20,880
everything's recorded all the

897
00:31:20,880 --> 00:31:23,279
consultation notes and the conversations

898
00:31:23,279 --> 00:31:25,360
are there it's easy for somebody new

899
00:31:25,360 --> 00:31:27,679
on either side to go up scroll through

900
00:31:27,679 --> 00:31:28,960
and look up like okay this is a

901
00:31:28,960 --> 00:31:30,720
conversation that's been had in the last

902
00:31:30,720 --> 00:31:33,039
three months

903
00:31:33,039 --> 00:31:35,039
we have a meeting with between the

904
00:31:35,039 --> 00:31:36,399
champion and the engineer

905
00:31:36,399 --> 00:31:38,159
and the security engineer once every two

906
00:31:38,159 --> 00:31:40,320
or three weeks depending on the workload

907
00:31:40,320 --> 00:31:42,640
and that kind of results in okay we're

908
00:31:42,640 --> 00:31:43,840
changing the color

909
00:31:43,840 --> 00:31:45,440
of this web page it doesn't need a

910
00:31:45,440 --> 00:31:47,200
threat model we're building this new

911
00:31:47,200 --> 00:31:49,200
feature that requires a threat model so

912
00:31:49,200 --> 00:31:50,760
those are sort of the

913
00:31:50,760 --> 00:31:53,840
documented activities that we do

914
00:31:53,840 --> 00:31:56,880
uh some of the undocumented not

915
00:31:56,880 --> 00:31:58,039
consequences but

916
00:31:58,039 --> 00:32:00,960
undocumented things that happen our

917
00:32:00,960 --> 00:32:02,880
security engineers get tagged on pr

918
00:32:02,880 --> 00:32:05,440
saying hey we work together here's a pr

919
00:32:05,440 --> 00:32:07,600
that i think needs security review

920
00:32:07,600 --> 00:32:09,440
take a look so we don't officially do

921
00:32:09,440 --> 00:32:10,720
security pr

922
00:32:10,720 --> 00:32:12,720
reviews but it just happens with the

923
00:32:12,720 --> 00:32:14,000
flow because of the

924
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:16,880
relation that is built on a one-to-one

925
00:32:16,880 --> 00:32:18,159
basis here

926
00:32:18,159 --> 00:32:21,279
and in terms of training we rolled out a

927
00:32:21,279 --> 00:32:23,600
advanced champions program of sorts so

928
00:32:23,600 --> 00:32:25,600
to marissa's point there's sort of this

929
00:32:25,600 --> 00:32:28,000
baseline training that is required as a

930
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:29,360
driver's license to be

931
00:32:29,360 --> 00:32:32,240
a champion but on top of it we also sort

932
00:32:32,240 --> 00:32:34,159
of released a red blue purple kind of

933
00:32:34,159 --> 00:32:36,559
tracks where we say okay if you pick red

934
00:32:36,559 --> 00:32:39,200
we'll help you do offensive stuff we'll

935
00:32:39,200 --> 00:32:40,720
let you be a part of one of the red team

936
00:32:40,720 --> 00:32:42,000
activities will let you do

937
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:44,240
x will let you do y and then blue

938
00:32:44,240 --> 00:32:46,399
becomes the defensive and purple

939
00:32:46,399 --> 00:32:48,080
i know the industry standard sort of the

940
00:32:48,080 --> 00:32:49,919
combination of red and blue but

941
00:32:49,919 --> 00:32:52,159
since we're a cloud native uh cloud

942
00:32:52,159 --> 00:32:54,240
first company we made that into a cloud

943
00:32:54,240 --> 00:32:58,559
training or a cloud security sort of

944
00:32:58,559 --> 00:33:00,399
team where we got the cloud security

945
00:33:00,399 --> 00:33:02,960
team to come in do a in-person training

946
00:33:02,960 --> 00:33:04,320
do some

947
00:33:04,320 --> 00:33:07,360
ad hoc challenges like they're a bunch

948
00:33:07,360 --> 00:33:09,440
of

949
00:33:09,440 --> 00:33:12,640
insecure cloud aws hosted challenges out

950
00:33:12,640 --> 00:33:13,840
there so we could have

951
00:33:13,840 --> 00:33:15,919
compiled all of those into a training

952
00:33:15,919 --> 00:33:17,679
material even and then sort of get

953
00:33:17,679 --> 00:33:18,880
people through it

954
00:33:18,880 --> 00:33:21,519
and that gives them privileges to do

955
00:33:21,519 --> 00:33:23,360
certain activities like approving

956
00:33:23,360 --> 00:33:25,360
subsets of firewalls from a security

957
00:33:25,360 --> 00:33:26,320
perspective

958
00:33:26,320 --> 00:33:28,720
which were originally intended to be

959
00:33:28,720 --> 00:33:32,799
done only by the security engineer

960
00:33:32,799 --> 00:33:35,519
so we've talked about a lot and for for

961
00:33:35,519 --> 00:33:37,120
a lot of activities a lot of different

962
00:33:37,120 --> 00:33:38,000
things we could do

963
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:39,279
through the security champions program

964
00:33:39,279 --> 00:33:41,039
and for someone who's

965
00:33:41,039 --> 00:33:45,039
um you know thinking about starting up a

966
00:33:45,039 --> 00:33:46,640
security champions program from scratch

967
00:33:46,640 --> 00:33:47,679
it could maybe be a little bit

968
00:33:47,679 --> 00:33:49,039
overwhelming particularly for developers

969
00:33:49,039 --> 00:33:50,240
you wouldn't necessarily want to

970
00:33:50,240 --> 00:33:51,840
push everything to a development team at

971
00:33:51,840 --> 00:33:53,360
once i'd like i'd love to

972
00:33:53,360 --> 00:33:54,960
hear from each of you here and and we'll

973
00:33:54,960 --> 00:33:56,399
start with uh yes

974
00:33:56,399 --> 00:33:59,120
um what would you start with there was

975
00:33:59,120 --> 00:34:00,399
one activity

976
00:34:00,399 --> 00:34:02,080
one thing you would like to push through

977
00:34:02,080 --> 00:34:03,519
a security champions program

978
00:34:03,519 --> 00:34:05,919
is it all specific company specific or

979
00:34:05,919 --> 00:34:08,159
or is there something that you've found

980
00:34:08,159 --> 00:34:09,440
most successful

981
00:34:09,440 --> 00:34:10,960
with that engagement through development

982
00:34:10,960 --> 00:34:13,599
teams i would start something which is

983
00:34:13,599 --> 00:34:15,918
tangible and that could differ from

984
00:34:15,918 --> 00:34:17,440
company to company if you're talking

985
00:34:17,440 --> 00:34:18,480
about

986
00:34:18,480 --> 00:34:21,199
a fairly new security program and you're

987
00:34:21,199 --> 00:34:22,239
starting off

988
00:34:22,239 --> 00:34:25,359
so some of the first few activities that

989
00:34:25,359 --> 00:34:27,280
you could do is talk about new features

990
00:34:27,280 --> 00:34:29,040
for building and do a lightweight threat

991
00:34:29,040 --> 00:34:29,679
model

992
00:34:29,679 --> 00:34:31,440
i think something important is not to

993
00:34:31,440 --> 00:34:33,520
keep adding a lot of work as part of the

994
00:34:33,520 --> 00:34:36,000
champions program to overwhelm people

995
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:37,918
so keeping it simple keeping it small

996
00:34:37,918 --> 00:34:39,359
could be a lightweight threat model

997
00:34:39,359 --> 00:34:41,119
could be a simplest

998
00:34:41,119 --> 00:34:44,000
uh security champion's responsibility is

999
00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:44,879
to make sure that

1000
00:34:44,879 --> 00:34:47,760
all the security tooling fast dependency

1001
00:34:47,760 --> 00:34:49,679
desk or integrated into that

1002
00:34:49,679 --> 00:34:52,480
team's pipelines so start off with like

1003
00:34:52,480 --> 00:34:53,918
one or two activities

1004
00:34:53,918 --> 00:34:57,279
and keep ramping up from there

1005
00:35:01,839 --> 00:35:03,839
sorry there we go marissa any thoughts

1006
00:35:03,839 --> 00:35:05,280
from you about uh

1007
00:35:05,280 --> 00:35:06,720
some of the activities you would start

1008
00:35:06,720 --> 00:35:08,400
with initially

1009
00:35:08,400 --> 00:35:10,800
uh after this conversation i want to

1010
00:35:10,800 --> 00:35:13,040
change my answer to

1011
00:35:13,040 --> 00:35:15,119
joshua's saying i love this idea of

1012
00:35:15,119 --> 00:35:17,040
having a slack channel for each

1013
00:35:17,040 --> 00:35:18,160
conversation

1014
00:35:18,160 --> 00:35:19,920
for the relationship that can maybe be

1015
00:35:19,920 --> 00:35:22,320
handed over as an artifact

1016
00:35:22,320 --> 00:35:24,960
so i think i would start there and what

1017
00:35:24,960 --> 00:35:26,320
i would hope to get out of it

1018
00:35:26,320 --> 00:35:29,680
is once introductions are made and the

1019
00:35:29,680 --> 00:35:31,280
expectations are set

1020
00:35:31,280 --> 00:35:32,800
uh something that would be great to

1021
00:35:32,800 --> 00:35:35,440
start with is if security champions

1022
00:35:35,440 --> 00:35:36,400
could reach out

1023
00:35:36,400 --> 00:35:38,960
to the security team every time a new

1024
00:35:38,960 --> 00:35:39,839
project is

1025
00:35:39,839 --> 00:35:41,760
started that has security implications

1026
00:35:41,760 --> 00:35:43,040
and apply that

1027
00:35:43,040 --> 00:35:46,079
spidey sense to this um

1028
00:35:46,079 --> 00:35:48,800
and then create just a very brief risk

1029
00:35:48,800 --> 00:35:50,000
assessment questionnaire

1030
00:35:50,000 --> 00:35:53,119
that's like three questions and toss

1031
00:35:53,119 --> 00:35:53,680
that

1032
00:35:53,680 --> 00:35:56,480
into the slack when a new project is

1033
00:35:56,480 --> 00:35:57,440
started

1034
00:35:57,440 --> 00:35:59,839
what visibility that would give our our

1035
00:35:59,839 --> 00:36:01,359
organization that would be great

1036
00:36:01,359 --> 00:36:03,119
and i think it would be doable one of

1037
00:36:03,119 --> 00:36:04,560
the things as well i love about that

1038
00:36:04,560 --> 00:36:05,520
kind of like a slack

1039
00:36:05,520 --> 00:36:08,160
organization is that it turns it almost

1040
00:36:08,160 --> 00:36:08,640
from a

1041
00:36:08,640 --> 00:36:10,160
community from a program into a

1042
00:36:10,160 --> 00:36:12,000
community where you get your

1043
00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:13,520
individuals in there talking to each

1044
00:36:13,520 --> 00:36:15,359
other straight away and and not

1045
00:36:15,359 --> 00:36:16,720
necessarily needing to wait for a

1046
00:36:16,720 --> 00:36:19,040
specific event or anything like that

1047
00:36:19,040 --> 00:36:20,560
and it really lowers that bar for people

1048
00:36:20,560 --> 00:36:22,400
to just reach out because likely you're

1049
00:36:22,400 --> 00:36:23,680
going to be using slack anyway in your

1050
00:36:23,680 --> 00:36:25,040
organization so you just

1051
00:36:25,040 --> 00:36:27,520
ping them straight away or whatever um

1052
00:36:27,520 --> 00:36:29,440
nick any any anything you wanted to add

1053
00:36:29,440 --> 00:36:31,680
yeah i completely agree on on sac

1054
00:36:31,680 --> 00:36:33,599
although we're limited to teams but

1055
00:36:33,599 --> 00:36:35,760
in a similar vein i think especially as

1056
00:36:35,760 --> 00:36:37,520
we've got our security teams flat and

1057
00:36:37,520 --> 00:36:38,000
has a

1058
00:36:38,000 --> 00:36:40,400
has a mix of different different

1059
00:36:40,400 --> 00:36:41,839
expertise and skill sets

1060
00:36:41,839 --> 00:36:43,359
being able to reach up reach out for

1061
00:36:43,359 --> 00:36:45,040
different people easily and quickly

1062
00:36:45,040 --> 00:36:47,200
something is a is a as a yeah it's a

1063
00:36:47,200 --> 00:36:48,320
massive efficient

1064
00:36:48,320 --> 00:36:51,359
efficiency and benefit um i think i want

1065
00:36:51,359 --> 00:36:52,079
to see

1066
00:36:52,079 --> 00:36:54,480
exactly what is exactly what yash said

1067
00:36:54,480 --> 00:36:56,880
is is what our priorities are for

1068
00:36:56,880 --> 00:36:58,560
the initial steps of it you know a new

1069
00:36:58,560 --> 00:37:00,400
security champion it's

1070
00:37:00,400 --> 00:37:02,480
being there to help identify what the

1071
00:37:02,480 --> 00:37:04,079
security requirements are for that

1072
00:37:04,079 --> 00:37:05,200
project and

1073
00:37:05,200 --> 00:37:07,520
especially starting small um first of

1074
00:37:07,520 --> 00:37:08,800
all it's helping

1075
00:37:08,800 --> 00:37:10,960
get all the information from that about

1076
00:37:10,960 --> 00:37:11,920
that project

1077
00:37:11,920 --> 00:37:14,000
and any relevant domain knowledge to the

1078
00:37:14,000 --> 00:37:15,839
security engineer who's supporting that

1079
00:37:15,839 --> 00:37:18,079
to help effectively throughout model it

1080
00:37:18,079 --> 00:37:20,160
and then eventually when when the

1081
00:37:20,160 --> 00:37:21,599
chicago's champions got up to speed it

1082
00:37:21,599 --> 00:37:22,800
throughout modeling to be able to do

1083
00:37:22,800 --> 00:37:24,160
that independently

1084
00:37:24,160 --> 00:37:26,400
as well as obviously making sure that

1085
00:37:26,400 --> 00:37:27,839
they're able to integrate

1086
00:37:27,839 --> 00:37:29,520
all the security testing tools and

1087
00:37:29,520 --> 00:37:32,640
they're working effectively first

1088
00:37:32,640 --> 00:37:34,640
awesome well would you believe it we

1089
00:37:34,640 --> 00:37:36,320
only have a few minutes left and i want

1090
00:37:36,320 --> 00:37:36,640
to

1091
00:37:36,640 --> 00:37:38,320
talk about an important point before i

1092
00:37:38,320 --> 00:37:40,400
kind of ask you all for your final

1093
00:37:40,400 --> 00:37:43,119
for your final takeaway um and and that

1094
00:37:43,119 --> 00:37:44,880
point is really um

1095
00:37:44,880 --> 00:37:48,160
in and around uh what individuals what

1096
00:37:48,160 --> 00:37:50,880
members of the security champions

1097
00:37:50,880 --> 00:37:52,400
program actually get out themselves and

1098
00:37:52,400 --> 00:37:52,960
i wanna

1099
00:37:52,960 --> 00:37:54,640
i know there are obviously security team

1100
00:37:54,640 --> 00:37:56,079
benefits as well but i feel like it's

1101
00:37:56,079 --> 00:37:57,760
important here to focus on

1102
00:37:57,760 --> 00:38:00,560
the development teams um now now marissa

1103
00:38:00,560 --> 00:38:02,640
you mentioned incentives uh briefly

1104
00:38:02,640 --> 00:38:04,160
earlier i'd love you to expand

1105
00:38:04,160 --> 00:38:05,599
on that because i feel like there are

1106
00:38:05,599 --> 00:38:07,200
going to be some perhaps

1107
00:38:07,200 --> 00:38:10,320
uh career incentives as well as other

1108
00:38:10,320 --> 00:38:12,960
types of incentives um how do you what

1109
00:38:12,960 --> 00:38:14,480
are the benefits

1110
00:38:14,480 --> 00:38:17,280
uh from the developers point of view of

1111
00:38:17,280 --> 00:38:18,880
a program of being part of a program

1112
00:38:18,880 --> 00:38:19,599
like that

1113
00:38:19,599 --> 00:38:20,880
and and talk us through more of the

1114
00:38:20,880 --> 00:38:23,040
incentives

1115
00:38:23,040 --> 00:38:25,359
yeah so in addition to what we've been

1116
00:38:25,359 --> 00:38:26,400
talking about which is

1117
00:38:26,400 --> 00:38:29,599
team velocity uh being able to complete

1118
00:38:29,599 --> 00:38:31,440
projects faster because you're closer to

1119
00:38:31,440 --> 00:38:32,720
the security review

1120
00:38:32,720 --> 00:38:36,000
and you also get a training and

1121
00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:36,960
experience

1122
00:38:36,960 --> 00:38:38,560
in a different area that can just

1123
00:38:38,560 --> 00:38:40,960
bolster your

1124
00:38:40,960 --> 00:38:43,359
your resume your your growth plan

1125
00:38:43,359 --> 00:38:45,200
getting more experience across

1126
00:38:45,200 --> 00:38:47,760
team i know at our company this sort of

1127
00:38:47,760 --> 00:38:48,720
cross-team

1128
00:38:48,720 --> 00:38:50,560
collaboration with other parts of the

1129
00:38:50,560 --> 00:38:52,400
organization is great

1130
00:38:52,400 --> 00:38:55,440
for building up your career profile and

1131
00:38:55,440 --> 00:38:58,400
so that building up investing in the

1132
00:38:58,400 --> 00:38:59,359
individual

1133
00:38:59,359 --> 00:39:03,200
really helps um and then also if you can

1134
00:39:03,200 --> 00:39:06,320
the just the fun stuff swag having a

1135
00:39:06,320 --> 00:39:06,960
team

1136
00:39:06,960 --> 00:39:09,119
logo and doing hoodies that sort of

1137
00:39:09,119 --> 00:39:10,079
thing

1138
00:39:10,079 --> 00:39:12,839
um it helps to create the culture of the

1139
00:39:12,839 --> 00:39:15,040
program absolutely a strong sense of

1140
00:39:15,040 --> 00:39:16,560
belonging as well being people being

1141
00:39:16,560 --> 00:39:18,079
part of something et cetera

1142
00:39:18,079 --> 00:39:19,599
anything else anyone wants to add in

1143
00:39:19,599 --> 00:39:22,000
terms of the incentives or

1144
00:39:22,000 --> 00:39:24,240
i think i have something to add like go

1145
00:39:24,240 --> 00:39:25,520
on sorry

1146
00:39:25,520 --> 00:39:29,760
i'm so you have to be quick so i think

1147
00:39:29,760 --> 00:39:31,599
honestly we haven't really need to offer

1148
00:39:31,599 --> 00:39:32,800
incentives because i think

1149
00:39:32,800 --> 00:39:34,800
the security champions have nominated

1150
00:39:34,800 --> 00:39:36,400
themselves and have an interest in

1151
00:39:36,400 --> 00:39:37,359
security

1152
00:39:37,359 --> 00:39:39,040
they they've just been expanding that

1153
00:39:39,040 --> 00:39:41,200
interest and developing it more so

1154
00:39:41,200 --> 00:39:42,960
especially you know i think it's it's

1155
00:39:42,960 --> 00:39:44,560
really good to see some some of this

1156
00:39:44,560 --> 00:39:46,640
you know security champions just bugging

1157
00:39:46,640 --> 00:39:47,680
me saying oh you know

1158
00:39:47,680 --> 00:39:49,359
one of my engineers showed them this

1159
00:39:49,359 --> 00:39:50,960
he's gonna have a burp license so i can

1160
00:39:50,960 --> 00:39:52,000
start doing it myself

1161
00:39:52,000 --> 00:39:54,880
um so i think i think i think it's yeah

1162
00:39:54,880 --> 00:39:55,599
i think that

1163
00:39:55,599 --> 00:39:58,000
the kind of incentives are already

1164
00:39:58,000 --> 00:39:59,359
already there if there's an interest in

1165
00:39:59,359 --> 00:40:00,240
security

1166
00:40:00,240 --> 00:40:01,920
i think something else which you've also

1167
00:40:01,920 --> 00:40:04,400
which is also a positive thing is to to

1168
00:40:04,400 --> 00:40:05,440
it's just that nature of some

1169
00:40:05,440 --> 00:40:07,040
competitiveness so being able to put

1170
00:40:07,040 --> 00:40:08,800
some some leaderboards up for

1171
00:40:08,800 --> 00:40:10,480
you know security posture in particular

1172
00:40:10,480 --> 00:40:12,240
environments because obviously there's a

1173
00:40:12,240 --> 00:40:14,480
there's a pride in that and and i wanted

1174
00:40:14,480 --> 00:40:15,920
to be near the top there for

1175
00:40:15,920 --> 00:40:18,160
each team to see their their you know

1176
00:40:18,160 --> 00:40:19,839
their cloud environments and their

1177
00:40:19,839 --> 00:40:22,880
um application um code based being as up

1178
00:40:22,880 --> 00:40:25,839
there as secure as possible

1179
00:40:27,280 --> 00:40:29,760
um i have two things to add one i'd

1180
00:40:29,760 --> 00:40:31,680
agree with what both of them have said

1181
00:40:31,680 --> 00:40:33,680
in terms of the career growth of the

1182
00:40:33,680 --> 00:40:35,680
individual who's a champion right like

1183
00:40:35,680 --> 00:40:36,960
putting that on your resume that i've

1184
00:40:36,960 --> 00:40:38,480
worked on security issues that was a

1185
00:40:38,480 --> 00:40:39,359
security

1186
00:40:39,359 --> 00:40:41,119
sort of point of contact for this team

1187
00:40:41,119 --> 00:40:43,040
that's really great addition

1188
00:40:43,040 --> 00:40:45,280
uh the other thing that we do and this

1189
00:40:45,280 --> 00:40:46,560
helps sort of intense

1190
00:40:46,560 --> 00:40:48,000
incentivize the program for the

1191
00:40:48,000 --> 00:40:49,440
individuals plus the engineering

1192
00:40:49,440 --> 00:40:50,720
management as well

1193
00:40:50,720 --> 00:40:53,760
is certain activities that

1194
00:40:53,760 --> 00:40:56,400
are reserved for security could be a pr

1195
00:40:56,400 --> 00:40:58,640
plus one could be a firewall plus one

1196
00:40:58,640 --> 00:40:59,359
could be

1197
00:40:59,359 --> 00:41:02,319
anything of the that nature right if you

1198
00:41:02,319 --> 00:41:04,319
can find a subset of those

1199
00:41:04,319 --> 00:41:06,240
and say security champions who have done

1200
00:41:06,240 --> 00:41:08,560
x y and z trainings or who have done x y

1201
00:41:08,560 --> 00:41:10,079
and z activities

1202
00:41:10,079 --> 00:41:12,880
will now be able to approve these things

1203
00:41:12,880 --> 00:41:15,440
that only security was able to approve

1204
00:41:15,440 --> 00:41:18,160
and that combined with finding

1205
00:41:18,160 --> 00:41:20,000
vulnerabilities and issues early

1206
00:41:20,000 --> 00:41:23,119
on in the sdlc kind of helps

1207
00:41:23,119 --> 00:41:25,599
make your build and deploy process much

1208
00:41:25,599 --> 00:41:26,960
faster

1209
00:41:26,960 --> 00:41:28,319
than the traditional way where it'd be

1210
00:41:28,319 --> 00:41:30,079
like okay design build

1211
00:41:30,079 --> 00:41:32,880
wait for an approval for a day then a

1212
00:41:32,880 --> 00:41:34,000
pen test then

1213
00:41:34,000 --> 00:41:35,839
go back and make some changes right so

1214
00:41:35,839 --> 00:41:37,599
you take all of those uh

1215
00:41:37,599 --> 00:41:40,240
friction points for the engineers out

1216
00:41:40,240 --> 00:41:41,680
and say have a beefed up

1217
00:41:41,680 --> 00:41:44,000
champion or multiple champions you get

1218
00:41:44,000 --> 00:41:45,680
to approve some of your own things

1219
00:41:45,680 --> 00:41:47,200
you get to know the security stuff you

1220
00:41:47,200 --> 00:41:49,839
need to fix before and you can just move

1221
00:41:49,839 --> 00:41:51,440
at a faster pace

1222
00:41:51,440 --> 00:41:54,160
so that's the other sort of incentive we

1223
00:41:54,160 --> 00:41:55,920
sell as part of the program

1224
00:41:55,920 --> 00:41:57,680
yeah i love that speeding it speeds up

1225
00:41:57,680 --> 00:41:59,440
development rather than slows it down

1226
00:41:59,440 --> 00:42:00,480
which is an important

1227
00:42:00,480 --> 00:42:02,800
thing very very briefly then just to

1228
00:42:02,800 --> 00:42:04,319
finish off um i'd love

1229
00:42:04,319 --> 00:42:07,359
for each of you to to um tell me about

1230
00:42:07,359 --> 00:42:08,880
what your greatest takeaways from this

1231
00:42:08,880 --> 00:42:09,680
session

1232
00:42:09,680 --> 00:42:12,319
uh or best practice that you would

1233
00:42:12,319 --> 00:42:13,119
advise

1234
00:42:13,119 --> 00:42:14,880
someone would follow why don't we start

1235
00:42:14,880 --> 00:42:16,960
with you uh yes

1236
00:42:16,960 --> 00:42:20,319
cool uh my takeaway is that our

1237
00:42:20,319 --> 00:42:22,400
uh thoughts about the champions program

1238
00:42:22,400 --> 00:42:24,000
are shared across the industry and not

1239
00:42:24,000 --> 00:42:25,760
sort of silent to the companies it's

1240
00:42:25,760 --> 00:42:27,760
sort of a word of confidence from

1241
00:42:27,760 --> 00:42:29,839
other members of the industry saying yes

1242
00:42:29,839 --> 00:42:32,720
this works and we use it too

1243
00:42:32,720 --> 00:42:36,400
awesome marissa for me it's

1244
00:42:36,400 --> 00:42:39,200
incorporating a security questionnaire a

1245
00:42:39,200 --> 00:42:40,800
quick security review

1246
00:42:40,800 --> 00:42:43,280
empowering developers to take on more of

1247
00:42:43,280 --> 00:42:44,079
their security

1248
00:42:44,079 --> 00:42:47,280
activities by creating a kind of

1249
00:42:47,280 --> 00:42:50,480
handoff or a driver's license where

1250
00:42:50,480 --> 00:42:52,000
you're empowering them

1251
00:42:52,000 --> 00:42:54,319
to take ownership of the things because

1252
00:42:54,319 --> 00:42:55,760
they own the code

1253
00:42:55,760 --> 00:42:57,920
so you're just that shifting left

1254
00:42:57,920 --> 00:42:59,440
strategy to

1255
00:42:59,440 --> 00:43:01,440
move the security activities closer to

1256
00:43:01,440 --> 00:43:03,040
where the code actually lives

1257
00:43:03,040 --> 00:43:04,560
i love that the developer's taking

1258
00:43:04,560 --> 00:43:06,160
ownership it's very powerful for sure

1259
00:43:06,160 --> 00:43:06,640
yeah

1260
00:43:06,640 --> 00:43:09,200
and nick i think probably the most

1261
00:43:09,200 --> 00:43:10,480
important thing for

1262
00:43:10,480 --> 00:43:12,480
security champions program is is the

1263
00:43:12,480 --> 00:43:14,560
security champions themselves so it's

1264
00:43:14,560 --> 00:43:15,760
just making sure you've got the right

1265
00:43:15,760 --> 00:43:17,280
people they're the ones that got you

1266
00:43:17,280 --> 00:43:19,280
know knowledge of that

1267
00:43:19,280 --> 00:43:21,520
their team of their product and the

1268
00:43:21,520 --> 00:43:23,119
background in that tech stack

1269
00:43:23,119 --> 00:43:25,599
and are really passionate you know about

1270
00:43:25,599 --> 00:43:27,760
and wanting to learn more about security

1271
00:43:27,760 --> 00:43:29,760
um that's probably what we seem to be

1272
00:43:29,760 --> 00:43:32,000
the most effective important thing

1273
00:43:32,000 --> 00:43:34,319
wonderful well thank you very much it's

1274
