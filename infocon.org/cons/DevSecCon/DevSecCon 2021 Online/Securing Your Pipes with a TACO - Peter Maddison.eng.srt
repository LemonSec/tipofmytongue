2
00:00:12,320 --> 00:00:15,759
hello and welcome to devsecond24 this is

3
00:00:15,759 --> 00:00:17,600
me peter madison i'm here to give you

4
00:00:17,600 --> 00:00:19,760
the talk on securing your pipes with a

5
00:00:19,760 --> 00:00:20,640
taco

6
00:00:20,640 --> 00:00:22,080
which is really about the people and

7
00:00:22,080 --> 00:00:24,160
process of automating governance

8
00:00:24,160 --> 00:00:26,480
uh i always have uh these talks

9
00:00:26,480 --> 00:00:28,160
structured around these talk maps so

10
00:00:28,160 --> 00:00:29,760
this idea of we're going to start with

11
00:00:29,760 --> 00:00:30,000
an

12
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:31,920
introduction we're going to run through

13
00:00:31,920 --> 00:00:34,239
a little bit about what risk is

14
00:00:34,239 --> 00:00:36,000
some things about automating governance

15
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:37,840
and how you can go about doing that

16
00:00:37,840 --> 00:00:40,640
and why and how to make a taco and then

17
00:00:40,640 --> 00:00:42,239
we're going to wrap up with some

18
00:00:42,239 --> 00:00:45,520
q a and some final points

19
00:00:45,520 --> 00:00:47,920
so who am i i'm peter madison i'm a

20
00:00:47,920 --> 00:00:50,000
coach a consultant and founder of a

21
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:51,920
consultancy called zodiac out of toronto

22
00:00:51,920 --> 00:00:52,800
canada

23
00:00:52,800 --> 00:00:55,680
uh i do all sorts of things in my career

24
00:00:55,680 --> 00:00:56,800
from being a

25
00:00:56,800 --> 00:00:58,879
program manager to rolling out global

26
00:00:58,879 --> 00:01:00,399
identity systems to helping

27
00:01:00,399 --> 00:01:01,520
organizations

28
00:01:01,520 --> 00:01:04,400
adopt value stream management and these

29
00:01:04,400 --> 00:01:05,840
days i work a lot on

30
00:01:05,840 --> 00:01:09,360
risk as it's associated to value streams

31
00:01:09,360 --> 00:01:12,080
so i've got to start us off here for a

32
00:01:12,080 --> 00:01:13,840
way of introduction to talk about the

33
00:01:13,840 --> 00:01:15,280
the fast-paced world we live in and

34
00:01:15,280 --> 00:01:16,960
we're in a world where

35
00:01:16,960 --> 00:01:19,200
we we have to be able to deliver value

36
00:01:19,200 --> 00:01:20,799
to our customers quickly customers

37
00:01:20,799 --> 00:01:22,560
demand instant gratification we all

38
00:01:22,560 --> 00:01:23,680
carry around these

39
00:01:23,680 --> 00:01:26,000
little black rectangles that have these

40
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:27,439
applications on them and if the

41
00:01:27,439 --> 00:01:29,040
application's doing what we want we'll

42
00:01:29,040 --> 00:01:30,960
download another one that does

43
00:01:30,960 --> 00:01:32,960
so and we've gone from this world in the

44
00:01:32,960 --> 00:01:34,560
past where it was all about we buy

45
00:01:34,560 --> 00:01:35,600
technology

46
00:01:35,600 --> 00:01:38,560
based on how much it costs what's the

47
00:01:38,560 --> 00:01:39,360
cheapest

48
00:01:39,360 --> 00:01:40,960
i can get that thing for to a world

49
00:01:40,960 --> 00:01:43,200
where we were buying technology based on

50
00:01:43,200 --> 00:01:45,119
the introduction of the how everything

51
00:01:45,119 --> 00:01:46,159
integrated all the different

52
00:01:46,159 --> 00:01:47,840
capabilities we could build off of the

53
00:01:47,840 --> 00:01:48,320
network

54
00:01:48,320 --> 00:01:50,000
capabilities of different technologies

55
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:51,520
we glued together

56
00:01:51,520 --> 00:01:52,799
and we're now moving into this world

57
00:01:52,799 --> 00:01:54,479
where it's really the customers driving

58
00:01:54,479 --> 00:01:56,479
the experience the customer that

59
00:01:56,479 --> 00:01:57,920
dictates the value and a lot of the

60
00:01:57,920 --> 00:01:59,280
complexity is being put behind the

61
00:01:59,280 --> 00:02:00,000
scenes

62
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:01,920
and we've brought our companies now need

63
00:02:01,920 --> 00:02:03,520
to be able to move towards this idea of

64
00:02:03,520 --> 00:02:05,280
value delivery how do we deliver value

65
00:02:05,280 --> 00:02:06,799
faster to our customers

66
00:02:06,799 --> 00:02:08,639
and there's lots of tools out there that

67
00:02:08,639 --> 00:02:10,160
will help you accelerate your value

68
00:02:10,160 --> 00:02:10,878
delivery

69
00:02:10,878 --> 00:02:13,440
uh all sorts of things that'll do this

70
00:02:13,440 --> 00:02:14,080
but it's

71
00:02:14,080 --> 00:02:16,080
really the these efforts tend to fail

72
00:02:16,080 --> 00:02:17,760
more from a lack of clarity not the

73
00:02:17,760 --> 00:02:18,480
tools

74
00:02:18,480 --> 00:02:20,560
there's lots of things in organizations

75
00:02:20,560 --> 00:02:22,000
and the way that we work together to get

76
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:23,200
in the way of us

77
00:02:23,200 --> 00:02:25,200
being able to actually deliver this

78
00:02:25,200 --> 00:02:28,080
value to our clients

79
00:02:28,080 --> 00:02:31,280
so this a lot of the work that i'm going

80
00:02:31,280 --> 00:02:32,879
to talk about through this presentation

81
00:02:32,879 --> 00:02:34,800
comes from some work i did

82
00:02:34,800 --> 00:02:37,599
a few years ago with a couple of large

83
00:02:37,599 --> 00:02:38,480
banks

84
00:02:38,480 --> 00:02:41,200
where we were looking at helping them

85
00:02:41,200 --> 00:02:42,959
accelerate their devops strategy helping

86
00:02:42,959 --> 00:02:43,840
them

87
00:02:43,840 --> 00:02:46,959
move from a very traditional sdlc

88
00:02:46,959 --> 00:02:50,080
uh set up to one where we had

89
00:02:50,080 --> 00:02:53,040
much more continuous delivery-ish type

90
00:02:53,040 --> 00:02:54,319
processes in place

91
00:02:54,319 --> 00:02:56,800
and that we were starting to look at

92
00:02:56,800 --> 00:02:58,080
different ways of operating different

93
00:02:58,080 --> 00:02:58,959
ways of learning

94
00:02:58,959 --> 00:03:01,599
and a large part of this ended up being

95
00:03:01,599 --> 00:03:03,280
all around

96
00:03:03,280 --> 00:03:05,519
security compliance and how do we start

97
00:03:05,519 --> 00:03:06,879
to get those aligned

98
00:03:06,879 --> 00:03:08,879
into the way that we both build our

99
00:03:08,879 --> 00:03:10,159
pipelines and that we

100
00:03:10,159 --> 00:03:14,640
deliver value so

101
00:03:14,640 --> 00:03:16,800
a lot of the things that we had to do

102
00:03:16,800 --> 00:03:18,000
all involved change

103
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:20,000
and change is a very tough thing where

104
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:21,920
we have to be able to change but we're

105
00:03:21,920 --> 00:03:23,280
very we're very bad at it

106
00:03:23,280 --> 00:03:26,239
we we really shy away from it and one of

107
00:03:26,239 --> 00:03:27,760
the big things that we need to be able

108
00:03:27,760 --> 00:03:29,040
to do in order to

109
00:03:29,040 --> 00:03:30,799
go through or to accept any change

110
00:03:30,799 --> 00:03:32,560
changes to be able to say okay

111
00:03:32,560 --> 00:03:35,200
we're we're good we accept the risks and

112
00:03:35,200 --> 00:03:38,879
we're okay to make this change for us

113
00:03:38,959 --> 00:03:41,920
and along comes devops where we can say

114
00:03:41,920 --> 00:03:44,000
okay so people process and tools working

115
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:45,440
together deliver rapid and continuous

116
00:03:45,440 --> 00:03:46,799
delivery of value to customers this is

117
00:03:46,799 --> 00:03:48,000
wonderful and we

118
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:49,519
as we're saying it's like there's still

119
00:03:49,519 --> 00:03:51,200
all of this focus on the tools

120
00:03:51,200 --> 00:03:53,280
and a little bit on the processes and we

121
00:03:53,280 --> 00:03:55,200
moved some processes into the tools

122
00:03:55,200 --> 00:03:56,080
without really

123
00:03:56,080 --> 00:03:57,519
looking at the process and how they

124
00:03:57,519 --> 00:03:59,599
change but we haven't really

125
00:03:59,599 --> 00:04:01,680
spent as much time as we should on what

126
00:04:01,680 --> 00:04:03,120
does this do to the people as we're

127
00:04:03,120 --> 00:04:04,879
changing

128
00:04:04,879 --> 00:04:06,400
and this will and it's all very easy

129
00:04:06,400 --> 00:04:08,400
right it's uh it's so easy to

130
00:04:08,400 --> 00:04:10,159
bring all of these new ways of working

131
00:04:10,159 --> 00:04:12,159
uh introduce all these new factors these

132
00:04:12,159 --> 00:04:13,280
new tools

133
00:04:13,280 --> 00:04:14,959
all of this new change as we move

134
00:04:14,959 --> 00:04:16,959
forward to start to get better at value

135
00:04:16,959 --> 00:04:18,399
delivery

136
00:04:18,399 --> 00:04:21,519
it's a lot to cope with and human beings

137
00:04:21,519 --> 00:04:22,800
aren't necessarily all that good at

138
00:04:22,800 --> 00:04:25,120
dealing with change we go through

139
00:04:25,120 --> 00:04:27,199
these these stages as we look at

140
00:04:27,199 --> 00:04:28,160
exchange and

141
00:04:28,160 --> 00:04:30,639
new paradigms and new ways of working

142
00:04:30,639 --> 00:04:31,840
and all of the uh

143
00:04:31,840 --> 00:04:33,600
the new things that we have to learn

144
00:04:33,600 --> 00:04:34,960
that send us through this

145
00:04:34,960 --> 00:04:37,280
and we often start with this idea that

146
00:04:37,280 --> 00:04:38,639
we we don't want to do this

147
00:04:38,639 --> 00:04:40,320
it's like it's not going to happen to us

148
00:04:40,320 --> 00:04:42,160
we're going to ignore it completely to

149
00:04:42,160 --> 00:04:43,759
complaining ah no you can't do that

150
00:04:43,759 --> 00:04:45,840
that'll never work here just starting to

151
00:04:45,840 --> 00:04:47,360
plead with people like please don't do

152
00:04:47,360 --> 00:04:48,000
this to me

153
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:50,160
to actually sulking and complaining

154
00:04:50,160 --> 00:04:51,199
about well

155
00:04:51,199 --> 00:04:53,040
okay i guess we have to do it now to

156
00:04:53,040 --> 00:04:54,960
finally accepting the change and

157
00:04:54,960 --> 00:04:56,880
a lot of what we're talking about when

158
00:04:56,880 --> 00:04:58,400
we start to adopt

159
00:04:58,400 --> 00:05:00,639
devops type practices and agile type

160
00:05:00,639 --> 00:05:01,840
practices is

161
00:05:01,840 --> 00:05:04,560
how do we lower this adoption change

162
00:05:04,560 --> 00:05:06,320
this adoption curve how do we make it

163
00:05:06,320 --> 00:05:09,120
easier for us to adopt change how to

164
00:05:09,120 --> 00:05:11,280
make it easier for the organization

165
00:05:11,280 --> 00:05:15,440
to take change on and do this faster

166
00:05:15,440 --> 00:05:17,440
so in the going back to the engagements

167
00:05:17,440 --> 00:05:19,440
that i was doing we'd started down this

168
00:05:19,440 --> 00:05:20,000
they

169
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:21,759
they were doing some of the right things

170
00:05:21,759 --> 00:05:23,840
and i decided to help them build out

171
00:05:23,840 --> 00:05:26,320
some platforms and look at okay how do

172
00:05:26,320 --> 00:05:27,440
we start to

173
00:05:27,440 --> 00:05:30,000
create platforms that make it easier so

174
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:31,440
that it's not so difficult to change so

175
00:05:31,440 --> 00:05:34,080
it's easier to involve people build out

176
00:05:34,080 --> 00:05:35,759
blueprinted pipelines that we can

177
00:05:35,759 --> 00:05:37,680
provide to our development teams will

178
00:05:37,680 --> 00:05:38,960
then be able to

179
00:05:38,960 --> 00:05:40,320
integrate all of these products and

180
00:05:40,320 --> 00:05:41,840
solve a lot of where their pain points

181
00:05:41,840 --> 00:05:42,880
are so they can

182
00:05:42,880 --> 00:05:44,800
get faster at being able to delete liver

183
00:05:44,800 --> 00:05:46,479
value and so we we drew a lot of

184
00:05:46,479 --> 00:05:47,440
pictures

185
00:05:47,440 --> 00:05:49,600
we set up a number of communities we

186
00:05:49,600 --> 00:05:52,080
started to educate and train and upskill

187
00:05:52,080 --> 00:05:52,479
and

188
00:05:52,479 --> 00:05:54,320
and introduce new concepts out into the

189
00:05:54,320 --> 00:05:55,919
teams and this

190
00:05:55,919 --> 00:05:58,240
went relatively well and had some good

191
00:05:58,240 --> 00:05:59,840
impact

192
00:05:59,840 --> 00:06:01,600
but then we started hit a wall and the

193
00:06:01,600 --> 00:06:03,360
wall that we were hitting working within

194
00:06:03,360 --> 00:06:05,520
a large regulated organization was the

195
00:06:05,520 --> 00:06:06,800
one around

196
00:06:06,800 --> 00:06:09,919
audit and compliance and there's

197
00:06:09,919 --> 00:06:13,120
there was these problems where

198
00:06:13,120 --> 00:06:15,120
okay so we're accelerating it we've

199
00:06:15,120 --> 00:06:17,039
built these pipelines yes it allows us

200
00:06:17,039 --> 00:06:17,840
to overcome

201
00:06:17,840 --> 00:06:21,120
certain uh what were very manual

202
00:06:21,120 --> 00:06:23,680
control gates uh previously and but we

203
00:06:23,680 --> 00:06:26,160
needed some other ways of being able to

204
00:06:26,160 --> 00:06:28,319
uh demonstrate that we were doing the

205
00:06:28,319 --> 00:06:29,600
right things because uh

206
00:06:29,600 --> 00:06:33,199
we hadn't necessarily brought um these

207
00:06:33,199 --> 00:06:35,280
security compliance and audit or even

208
00:06:35,280 --> 00:06:37,120
maybe architecture into

209
00:06:37,120 --> 00:06:39,120
uh the understanding of hey look what

210
00:06:39,120 --> 00:06:40,880
we're doing isn't really breaking any of

211
00:06:40,880 --> 00:06:42,639
the rules that you have

212
00:06:42,639 --> 00:06:44,319
uh how do we demonstrate to you that

213
00:06:44,319 --> 00:06:45,840
we're doing the right thing

214
00:06:45,840 --> 00:06:46,960
and that we're going to do the right

215
00:06:46,960 --> 00:06:49,199
thing at speed and is that what would

216
00:06:49,199 --> 00:06:50,960
what is it you need to be able to do

217
00:06:50,960 --> 00:06:51,840
that

218
00:06:51,840 --> 00:06:54,800
in order for you to see that so that was

219
00:06:54,800 --> 00:06:56,000
the introduction so that's kind of

220
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:57,280
setting the stage for the kind of

221
00:06:57,280 --> 00:06:58,880
problem set that we're seeing all around

222
00:06:58,880 --> 00:07:00,240
devops and uh

223
00:07:00,240 --> 00:07:01,919
how we started to run into these

224
00:07:01,919 --> 00:07:03,360
problems dealing with

225
00:07:03,360 --> 00:07:05,440
uh the what we might want to call the

226
00:07:05,440 --> 00:07:06,880
safety part of the organization the

227
00:07:06,880 --> 00:07:08,560
compliance audit security

228
00:07:08,560 --> 00:07:11,680
all of those parts of the organization

229
00:07:11,680 --> 00:07:13,680
now let's talk a little bit about uh

230
00:07:13,680 --> 00:07:15,599
about risk so now if we look at

231
00:07:15,599 --> 00:07:17,599
governance risk and compliance this is a

232
00:07:17,599 --> 00:07:19,120
this is a way of looking

233
00:07:19,120 --> 00:07:23,120
at how we manage uh risk within the

234
00:07:23,120 --> 00:07:24,240
organization

235
00:07:24,240 --> 00:07:26,160
and this really is about what are the

236
00:07:26,160 --> 00:07:27,599
different things that we can do

237
00:07:27,599 --> 00:07:30,639
to both understand risk and put into

238
00:07:30,639 --> 00:07:32,000
place to ensure that

239
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:34,000
we are properly identifying those risks

240
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:36,319
and managing them appropriately

241
00:07:36,319 --> 00:07:38,080
for the circumstances that we're doing

242
00:07:38,080 --> 00:07:39,360
things

243
00:07:39,360 --> 00:07:40,960
unfortunately in a lot of times in

244
00:07:40,960 --> 00:07:42,400
organizations

245
00:07:42,400 --> 00:07:45,680
where these practices are sometimes done

246
00:07:45,680 --> 00:07:47,120
with a group that's sort of

247
00:07:47,120 --> 00:07:49,919
somewhat aligned to um what technology

248
00:07:49,919 --> 00:07:50,720
is doing

249
00:07:50,720 --> 00:07:53,360
uh but they're often off to one side and

250
00:07:53,360 --> 00:07:54,400
they're much smaller and they don't

251
00:07:54,400 --> 00:07:55,360
necessarily have a

252
00:07:55,360 --> 00:07:58,879
um the capacity to be able to be

253
00:07:58,879 --> 00:08:00,319
involved in every decision that's being

254
00:08:00,319 --> 00:08:01,039
made

255
00:08:01,039 --> 00:08:04,000
so we needed some ways to bring them

256
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:05,599
closer to what we were building out in

257
00:08:05,599 --> 00:08:06,800
terms of a platform

258
00:08:06,800 --> 00:08:09,919
to provide them assurance that we were

259
00:08:09,919 --> 00:08:11,680
appropriately managing risk

260
00:08:11,680 --> 00:08:13,440
in the acceleration delivery that we

261
00:08:13,440 --> 00:08:15,759
were doing and that they had a

262
00:08:15,759 --> 00:08:18,080
firm understanding that uh everything

263
00:08:18,080 --> 00:08:19,520
that we were helping enable the delivery

264
00:08:19,520 --> 00:08:21,360
teams to do to deliver value was

265
00:08:21,360 --> 00:08:23,280
going in the right direction and meeting

266
00:08:23,280 --> 00:08:24,840
the organizational

267
00:08:24,840 --> 00:08:27,840
requirements so what we were seeing

268
00:08:27,840 --> 00:08:28,800
really was that

269
00:08:28,800 --> 00:08:30,400
there was also some things were getting

270
00:08:30,400 --> 00:08:32,399
lost in translation because

271
00:08:32,399 --> 00:08:34,640
from a devops perspective we were saying

272
00:08:34,640 --> 00:08:35,440
well

273
00:08:35,440 --> 00:08:36,958
we're definitely ensuring that our

274
00:08:36,958 --> 00:08:38,799
environments are secure we're putting

275
00:08:38,799 --> 00:08:40,080
all the right pieces into place

276
00:08:40,080 --> 00:08:41,599
and the fact that everything's automated

277
00:08:41,599 --> 00:08:43,360
we're living delivering it in very small

278
00:08:43,360 --> 00:08:44,080
chunks we're

279
00:08:44,080 --> 00:08:45,519
we're starting to accelerate these

280
00:08:45,519 --> 00:08:47,920
pieces this is in itself

281
00:08:47,920 --> 00:08:49,839
ensuring that we're providing more

282
00:08:49,839 --> 00:08:51,200
secure delivery because

283
00:08:51,200 --> 00:08:53,680
we've got greater insight into how we're

284
00:08:53,680 --> 00:08:55,040
doing things

285
00:08:55,040 --> 00:08:57,519
but what we were seeing was that there

286
00:08:57,519 --> 00:08:59,120
was things that were getting lost in

287
00:08:59,120 --> 00:09:01,200
translation between the different areas

288
00:09:01,200 --> 00:09:02,800
of the organization

289
00:09:02,800 --> 00:09:06,160
so developers for example were

290
00:09:06,160 --> 00:09:07,760
trying to make sure they're building

291
00:09:07,760 --> 00:09:09,120
right things but their language that

292
00:09:09,120 --> 00:09:11,279
they're using was not that the testing

293
00:09:11,279 --> 00:09:13,519
teams were using and testing really was

294
00:09:13,519 --> 00:09:14,800
starting to move and become more

295
00:09:14,800 --> 00:09:16,720
integrated with development teams anyway

296
00:09:16,720 --> 00:09:17,279
the

297
00:09:17,279 --> 00:09:19,440
operations teams were breaking down that

298
00:09:19,440 --> 00:09:20,800
divide between development and

299
00:09:20,800 --> 00:09:22,320
operations but there were still

300
00:09:22,320 --> 00:09:24,080
very much different language barriers

301
00:09:24,080 --> 00:09:26,160
between them as there was between

302
00:09:26,160 --> 00:09:27,519
security and this is

303
00:09:27,519 --> 00:09:28,880
one of the other barriers we're seeing

304
00:09:28,880 --> 00:09:30,720
and with cloud compliance and with

305
00:09:30,720 --> 00:09:31,440
architecture

306
00:09:31,440 --> 00:09:33,040
all talking their own languages and it

307
00:09:33,040 --> 00:09:34,800
goes beyond that even into

308
00:09:34,800 --> 00:09:36,160
sales market every part of the

309
00:09:36,160 --> 00:09:38,399
organization has their own taxonomy

310
00:09:38,399 --> 00:09:39,760
their own language their own way of

311
00:09:39,760 --> 00:09:41,760
referring to things their only way their

312
00:09:41,760 --> 00:09:44,240
own models for looking at the world

313
00:09:44,240 --> 00:09:46,240
and a lot of what we were seeing we were

314
00:09:46,240 --> 00:09:48,399
needing to do as we started to automate

315
00:09:48,399 --> 00:09:50,240
across these different areas

316
00:09:50,240 --> 00:09:53,279
was there was a need to be able to

317
00:09:53,279 --> 00:09:55,040
help each of these different areas

318
00:09:55,040 --> 00:09:57,279
understand what the concerns were of the

319
00:09:57,279 --> 00:09:58,320
other areas

320
00:09:58,320 --> 00:10:00,800
and at least provide visibility into

321
00:10:00,800 --> 00:10:02,720
what those models they were using were

322
00:10:02,720 --> 00:10:04,560
and we needed some form of creating a

323
00:10:04,560 --> 00:10:05,920
common language so that

324
00:10:05,920 --> 00:10:07,360
these different areas were comfortable

325
00:10:07,360 --> 00:10:09,519
that as we started to automate things we

326
00:10:09,519 --> 00:10:10,320
were doing

327
00:10:10,320 --> 00:10:11,760
the right things that were going to help

328
00:10:11,760 --> 00:10:14,480
them move forward

329
00:10:14,480 --> 00:10:17,600
so if we so what i did

330
00:10:17,600 --> 00:10:19,360
at this point and going back to the

331
00:10:19,360 --> 00:10:21,279
conversation around the bank was

332
00:10:21,279 --> 00:10:24,320
i went and i sat down in particular with

333
00:10:24,320 --> 00:10:26,399
the compliance group that was closely

334
00:10:26,399 --> 00:10:28,320
aligned to the technology area

335
00:10:28,320 --> 00:10:30,880
and i invite him out for coffee and we

336
00:10:30,880 --> 00:10:32,000
sat down and we we

337
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:34,800
had a chat about well what is it you

338
00:10:34,800 --> 00:10:36,720
need what is it you need to see in our

339
00:10:36,720 --> 00:10:38,720
pipelines that will ensure that

340
00:10:38,720 --> 00:10:40,800
we are delivering securely we're

341
00:10:40,800 --> 00:10:42,160
properly managing risk

342
00:10:42,160 --> 00:10:43,760
we're properly identifying the things

343
00:10:43,760 --> 00:10:45,440
that should be identified

344
00:10:45,440 --> 00:10:48,480
and that if there are controls or

345
00:10:48,480 --> 00:10:50,480
regulations that we need to be aware of

346
00:10:50,480 --> 00:10:51,519
that those aren't getting

347
00:10:51,519 --> 00:10:53,440
lost as we start to accelerate our

348
00:10:53,440 --> 00:10:57,200
delivery in our in our pipelines

349
00:10:57,200 --> 00:10:59,279
so that brings us to automating

350
00:10:59,279 --> 00:11:00,880
governance so that was a bit around risk

351
00:11:00,880 --> 00:11:01,680
and the

352
00:11:01,680 --> 00:11:04,240
kinds of things that we were looking at

353
00:11:04,240 --> 00:11:05,600
now let's talk a little bit about

354
00:11:05,600 --> 00:11:07,279
automating the governance of these

355
00:11:07,279 --> 00:11:08,880
pipelines

356
00:11:08,880 --> 00:11:10,240
so the first part of this is

357
00:11:10,240 --> 00:11:12,079
understanding is there a risk

358
00:11:12,079 --> 00:11:13,600
is there something that we need to be

359
00:11:13,600 --> 00:11:15,200
concerned about here

360
00:11:15,200 --> 00:11:18,160
so one part of this and there's some

361
00:11:18,160 --> 00:11:19,839
very interesting ways of doing this in

362
00:11:19,839 --> 00:11:21,040
microservice

363
00:11:21,040 --> 00:11:23,519
architectures now where if we if we take

364
00:11:23,519 --> 00:11:24,720
a look at this

365
00:11:24,720 --> 00:11:27,519
um from a domain-driven design

366
00:11:27,519 --> 00:11:28,000
perspective

367
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:29,680
we can look at boundaries and start to

368
00:11:29,680 --> 00:11:32,160
auto-classify groupings of microservices

369
00:11:32,160 --> 00:11:33,600
and then start to assign

370
00:11:33,600 --> 00:11:35,360
risk based on our understanding from the

371
00:11:35,360 --> 00:11:36,800
business side what those might look like

372
00:11:36,800 --> 00:11:38,079
through different types of metadata and

373
00:11:38,079 --> 00:11:38,560
there's

374
00:11:38,560 --> 00:11:41,519
very interesting ways of solving that

375
00:11:41,519 --> 00:11:43,920
but that takes us from a very technical

376
00:11:43,920 --> 00:11:46,000
viewpoint of what is it in my

377
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:47,680
environment then what is it doing and

378
00:11:47,680 --> 00:11:49,120
how do i understand its risk

379
00:11:49,120 --> 00:11:50,480
but there's many many other types of

380
00:11:50,480 --> 00:11:52,160
risks that i need to be aware of across

381
00:11:52,160 --> 00:11:53,519
the organization

382
00:11:53,519 --> 00:11:56,240
from a technology perspective it can be

383
00:11:56,240 --> 00:11:57,920
difficult to keep track of all of these

384
00:11:57,920 --> 00:11:58,560
so i need

385
00:11:58,560 --> 00:12:01,519
i need some way of getting closer to

386
00:12:01,519 --> 00:12:03,120
what's happening in the pipeline to

387
00:12:03,120 --> 00:12:04,000
determine

388
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:05,600
is this something i need to be concerned

389
00:12:05,600 --> 00:12:08,320
about so working with the security teams

390
00:12:08,320 --> 00:12:09,920
we we laid out uh

391
00:12:09,920 --> 00:12:12,720
some categorization of what would we

392
00:12:12,720 --> 00:12:14,639
consider to be a high risk

393
00:12:14,639 --> 00:12:16,160
change and what would say the low risk

394
00:12:16,160 --> 00:12:17,839
change and will be a medium change

395
00:12:17,839 --> 00:12:20,800
largely categorized on usage of pi data

396
00:12:20,800 --> 00:12:22,480
uh within each of those different areas

397
00:12:22,480 --> 00:12:23,279
and we

398
00:12:23,279 --> 00:12:25,200
for our new standards that were being

399
00:12:25,200 --> 00:12:26,880
written we started to incorporate those

400
00:12:26,880 --> 00:12:28,560
into the standards to start to make it

401
00:12:28,560 --> 00:12:30,000
more of the vernacular

402
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:32,160
that was being used to communicate out

403
00:12:32,160 --> 00:12:35,360
to the delivery teams

404
00:12:35,600 --> 00:12:38,560
this in turn started to drive more

405
00:12:38,560 --> 00:12:40,320
collaboration around well what is it

406
00:12:40,320 --> 00:12:42,720
we can do to start to automate some of

407
00:12:42,720 --> 00:12:44,000
these compliance

408
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:46,000
checks into our different pipelines

409
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:47,040
where can we go about

410
00:12:47,040 --> 00:12:48,720
automating these what tools can we bring

411
00:12:48,720 --> 00:12:50,800
to the table to start to make these

412
00:12:50,800 --> 00:12:52,079
visible once we understand

413
00:12:52,079 --> 00:12:53,839
what it is that we need to be able to

414
00:12:53,839 --> 00:12:56,240
expose

415
00:12:56,240 --> 00:12:58,399
so if we start with a pipeline and this

416
00:12:58,399 --> 00:13:00,000
one's taken from a great

417
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:02,079
i.t revolution white paper that john

418
00:13:02,079 --> 00:13:04,720
willis contributed to

419
00:13:04,720 --> 00:13:06,959
where another reference to this later in

420
00:13:06,959 --> 00:13:08,399
this slide deck

421
00:13:08,399 --> 00:13:10,880
if we think about how the pipeline works

422
00:13:10,880 --> 00:13:11,760
there's many

423
00:13:11,760 --> 00:13:14,880
critical points at which we can start to

424
00:13:14,880 --> 00:13:16,399
implement automated governance and

425
00:13:16,399 --> 00:13:18,000
implement controls

426
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:20,639
starting from the source code repository

427
00:13:20,639 --> 00:13:22,560
the code that's being checked in

428
00:13:22,560 --> 00:13:25,839
the bills dependency management packages

429
00:13:25,839 --> 00:13:28,079
and artifact management non-production

430
00:13:28,079 --> 00:13:31,279
deploys and into the production deploys

431
00:13:31,279 --> 00:13:32,880
one of the problems that we see is often

432
00:13:32,880 --> 00:13:35,200
very often in organizations

433
00:13:35,200 --> 00:13:38,240
the security team is only there right at

434
00:13:38,240 --> 00:13:40,240
the very very end the security team

435
00:13:40,240 --> 00:13:42,639
is the stop right before production to

436
00:13:42,639 --> 00:13:44,000
say hey

437
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:45,920
no no you can't do that by which point

438
00:13:45,920 --> 00:13:47,600
of course it's far too late

439
00:13:47,600 --> 00:13:49,440
really what we want to be able to do is

440
00:13:49,440 --> 00:13:50,880
say okay have we

441
00:13:50,880 --> 00:13:52,320
checked for all of the security

442
00:13:52,320 --> 00:13:54,160
compliance at every single one of these

443
00:13:54,160 --> 00:13:55,040
stages

444
00:13:55,040 --> 00:13:57,360
so we think well okay we need a way to

445
00:13:57,360 --> 00:14:00,240
be able to do that

446
00:14:00,560 --> 00:14:02,959
and when we get to running the the pipes

447
00:14:02,959 --> 00:14:04,240
that we start to build

448
00:14:04,240 --> 00:14:07,120
we we start with this idea that uh if

449
00:14:07,120 --> 00:14:08,079
the

450
00:14:08,079 --> 00:14:10,320
if this is our view of what the

451
00:14:10,320 --> 00:14:12,240
different stages along the pipeline are

452
00:14:12,240 --> 00:14:13,600
when we run the pipe

453
00:14:13,600 --> 00:14:15,040
we can start to think about what is the

454
00:14:15,040 --> 00:14:17,519
flow of work that we see so if we're

455
00:14:17,519 --> 00:14:18,800
there different things that we can

456
00:14:18,800 --> 00:14:20,480
capture from a governance perspective

457
00:14:20,480 --> 00:14:22,240
and we can use as references

458
00:14:22,240 --> 00:14:24,480
to be able to say okay if we want to

459
00:14:24,480 --> 00:14:26,000
ensure that we're doing the right thing

460
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:27,760
and that we're not introducing risk

461
00:14:27,760 --> 00:14:29,839
what what areas can we pull information

462
00:14:29,839 --> 00:14:31,279
from and how can we ensure that we're

463
00:14:31,279 --> 00:14:32,720
doing the right thing so

464
00:14:32,720 --> 00:14:35,120
we start with how is the work defined

465
00:14:35,120 --> 00:14:36,880
and once we understand that how that

466
00:14:36,880 --> 00:14:38,639
work is defined we can

467
00:14:38,639 --> 00:14:40,880
create it as source code we can we can

468
00:14:40,880 --> 00:14:42,240
turn all of our

469
00:14:42,240 --> 00:14:45,360
creation into source code we can then uh

470
00:14:45,360 --> 00:14:47,680
use our ci tools to build that out

471
00:14:47,680 --> 00:14:49,199
and this refers to on those early

472
00:14:49,199 --> 00:14:50,959
diagrams with our automated

473
00:14:50,959 --> 00:14:54,079
pipelines we we then take both quality

474
00:14:54,079 --> 00:14:56,160
tests and build results which can then

475
00:14:56,160 --> 00:14:56,639
be

476
00:14:56,639 --> 00:14:58,480
validated and checked for before we

477
00:14:58,480 --> 00:14:59,680
build artifacts

478
00:14:59,680 --> 00:15:01,680
and the artifacts then are the the

479
00:15:01,680 --> 00:15:02,880
pieces that can get

480
00:15:02,880 --> 00:15:04,079
deployed into all subsequent

481
00:15:04,079 --> 00:15:05,199
environments we never want to be

482
00:15:05,199 --> 00:15:07,120
rebuilding artifacts at

483
00:15:07,120 --> 00:15:10,399
later stages by splitting our ci runs

484
00:15:10,399 --> 00:15:11,279
out into two

485
00:15:11,279 --> 00:15:13,519
this also allowed us to ensure that

486
00:15:13,519 --> 00:15:15,680
certain organizational tests were always

487
00:15:15,680 --> 00:15:16,639
taken care of

488
00:15:16,639 --> 00:15:19,920
that we made sure that we were not

489
00:15:19,920 --> 00:15:23,440
missing any tests that the security or

490
00:15:23,440 --> 00:15:24,560
compliance teams were

491
00:15:24,560 --> 00:15:27,360
needed to see happen and as we started

492
00:15:27,360 --> 00:15:28,639
to build these out

493
00:15:28,639 --> 00:15:31,279
what we realized was that the the manual

494
00:15:31,279 --> 00:15:31,920
checks

495
00:15:31,920 --> 00:15:34,160
and we found other ways of solving those

496
00:15:34,160 --> 00:15:35,199
moving and

497
00:15:35,199 --> 00:15:37,920
code reviews away from being in pull

498
00:15:37,920 --> 00:15:39,199
requests and moving them

499
00:15:39,199 --> 00:15:41,920
into the delivery teams directly through

500
00:15:41,920 --> 00:15:42,399
uh

501
00:15:42,399 --> 00:15:44,720
looking at uh techniques like modern

502
00:15:44,720 --> 00:15:46,320
pair programming ensuring that we're

503
00:15:46,320 --> 00:15:48,000
properly documenting

504
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:50,399
outcomes making sure that there was a

505
00:15:50,399 --> 00:15:51,759
good strong understanding within

506
00:15:51,759 --> 00:15:52,720
delivery teams

507
00:15:52,720 --> 00:15:55,600
as to making sure that we had proof that

508
00:15:55,600 --> 00:15:57,199
code had been properly managed and

509
00:15:57,199 --> 00:15:58,000
reviewed

510
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:00,480
uh code signing was used in some areas

511
00:16:00,480 --> 00:16:02,720
around critical uh projects as well

512
00:16:02,720 --> 00:16:04,639
and once we had different ways of

513
00:16:04,639 --> 00:16:06,240
managing certificates that caused a

514
00:16:06,240 --> 00:16:06,800
number of

515
00:16:06,800 --> 00:16:09,839
different problems and then we also

516
00:16:09,839 --> 00:16:10,720
realized that

517
00:16:10,720 --> 00:16:13,680
we could start to remove uh later manual

518
00:16:13,680 --> 00:16:14,399
steps

519
00:16:14,399 --> 00:16:16,079
as well as we started to look at that

520
00:16:16,079 --> 00:16:17,600
end-to-end pipeline we

521
00:16:17,600 --> 00:16:20,880
we managed to remove some of the manual

522
00:16:20,880 --> 00:16:22,240
steps were occurring especially around

523
00:16:22,240 --> 00:16:24,079
database deploys where that was still

524
00:16:24,079 --> 00:16:25,680
something of a sticking point within the

525
00:16:25,680 --> 00:16:26,880
organization

526
00:16:26,880 --> 00:16:28,560
all of what the while we were measuring

527
00:16:28,560 --> 00:16:30,320
the end to end cycle time and ensuring

528
00:16:30,320 --> 00:16:31,920
that we were using that as a metric to

529
00:16:31,920 --> 00:16:34,240
help us improve

530
00:16:34,240 --> 00:16:36,959
the from auditing the uh the pipeline

531
00:16:36,959 --> 00:16:39,120
we've now had a massive data from uh

532
00:16:39,120 --> 00:16:40,720
looking at all these different places we

533
00:16:40,720 --> 00:16:42,480
could pull information out

534
00:16:42,480 --> 00:16:45,839
our first uh iteration of this used

535
00:16:45,839 --> 00:16:48,800
and some tools that uh come out of the

536
00:16:48,800 --> 00:16:50,240
capital one space

537
00:16:50,240 --> 00:16:52,240
we ran into some problems with that as

538
00:16:52,240 --> 00:16:54,480
the even though it's an open source

539
00:16:54,480 --> 00:16:57,120
platform as they as the various plugins

540
00:16:57,120 --> 00:16:58,880
things like urban code deploy which we

541
00:16:58,880 --> 00:17:00,000
were using as they

542
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:02,000
as urban code deploy upgraded and the

543
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:03,680
plugins didn't upgrade fast enough and

544
00:17:03,680 --> 00:17:04,400
we couldn't

545
00:17:04,400 --> 00:17:05,839
we didn't have the development bandwidth

546
00:17:05,839 --> 00:17:07,679
to update the open source code so

547
00:17:07,679 --> 00:17:10,799
we switched from that initial model uh

548
00:17:10,799 --> 00:17:14,480
to one that used um logging

549
00:17:14,480 --> 00:17:17,679
and uh elastic and elk to

550
00:17:17,679 --> 00:17:20,880
basically do visualization of the

551
00:17:20,880 --> 00:17:23,039
uh of the logs to and that in turn

552
00:17:23,039 --> 00:17:24,480
allowed us to start to pull out some

553
00:17:24,480 --> 00:17:26,480
very interesting uh metrics that we were

554
00:17:26,480 --> 00:17:27,119
using

555
00:17:27,119 --> 00:17:28,880
uh both to radiate back to the

556
00:17:28,880 --> 00:17:30,840
organization our progress

557
00:17:30,840 --> 00:17:33,840
and give development teams insight as

558
00:17:33,840 --> 00:17:34,960
well as to

559
00:17:34,960 --> 00:17:36,720
uh what was happening within these

560
00:17:36,720 --> 00:17:40,000
automated pipelines we were building

561
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:42,000
of course these paved roads are great

562
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:44,160
and we one of the advantages we had as

563
00:17:44,160 --> 00:17:45,840
we started to go on this journey and

564
00:17:45,840 --> 00:17:47,520
build out these models was we

565
00:17:47,520 --> 00:17:49,280
we could blueprint them and we provided

566
00:17:49,280 --> 00:17:51,200
them back to the organization as

567
00:17:51,200 --> 00:17:53,840
ways of being able to deliver code

568
00:17:53,840 --> 00:17:55,200
faster and we could measure

569
00:17:55,200 --> 00:17:57,039
how many of these were starting to be

570
00:17:57,039 --> 00:17:59,039
used which which was great but we we

571
00:17:59,039 --> 00:18:00,320
also realized that

572
00:18:00,320 --> 00:18:02,880
this model wasn't for everybody that the

573
00:18:02,880 --> 00:18:04,880
the more advanced users wanted direct

574
00:18:04,880 --> 00:18:06,640
access into the apis we were using

575
00:18:06,640 --> 00:18:07,760
behind the scenes

576
00:18:07,760 --> 00:18:09,679
so that they could go faster than we

577
00:18:09,679 --> 00:18:11,679
could possibly make changes

578
00:18:11,679 --> 00:18:14,559
so the way we started to manage this was

579
00:18:14,559 --> 00:18:15,120
that

580
00:18:15,120 --> 00:18:17,120
here's the here's the easy button for

581
00:18:17,120 --> 00:18:20,080
the 80 percent of the organization that

582
00:18:20,080 --> 00:18:22,400
really wants a path to go forward and

583
00:18:22,400 --> 00:18:24,400
start to get better at this and

584
00:18:24,400 --> 00:18:26,640
and start to learn and get as a way to

585
00:18:26,640 --> 00:18:27,679
start to do that

586
00:18:27,679 --> 00:18:30,559
we then integrated the various control

587
00:18:30,559 --> 00:18:31,679
points into that

588
00:18:31,679 --> 00:18:33,600
so that we provide a bit of a character

589
00:18:33,600 --> 00:18:34,880
come and use it

590
00:18:34,880 --> 00:18:37,520
and then we looked for the other bits of

591
00:18:37,520 --> 00:18:40,080
the organization the more advanced users

592
00:18:40,080 --> 00:18:41,840
we started to provide more direct access

593
00:18:41,840 --> 00:18:42,960
so they could start to build out

594
00:18:42,960 --> 00:18:44,720
solutions and we could learn from them

595
00:18:44,720 --> 00:18:44,960
and

596
00:18:44,960 --> 00:18:48,720
incorporate them back into the platform

597
00:18:51,919 --> 00:18:54,320
and taking the one of the other

598
00:18:54,320 --> 00:18:56,320
advantages of taking that approach

599
00:18:56,320 --> 00:18:59,919
was that it allowed us to learn from the

600
00:18:59,919 --> 00:19:01,520
users of the pipelines that we were

601
00:19:01,520 --> 00:19:02,240
building

602
00:19:02,240 --> 00:19:04,720
it allowed us to also consider that well

603
00:19:04,720 --> 00:19:06,400
maybe we want to do this a different way

604
00:19:06,400 --> 00:19:07,760
maybe we want to go

605
00:19:07,760 --> 00:19:09,440
in a different direction we don't want

606
00:19:09,440 --> 00:19:11,120
to just say hey here's

607
00:19:11,120 --> 00:19:13,200
here's a set of ways of doing things

608
00:19:13,200 --> 00:19:14,880
here's the pipeline that all of you must

609
00:19:14,880 --> 00:19:16,799
use you must do it this way in order for

610
00:19:16,799 --> 00:19:19,120
us to remain secure that wasn't going to

611
00:19:19,120 --> 00:19:20,880
build up the trust that we needed it

612
00:19:20,880 --> 00:19:22,320
wasn't we didn't have the bandwidth

613
00:19:22,320 --> 00:19:23,760
within the teams i was working with to

614
00:19:23,760 --> 00:19:25,280
be able to do that we

615
00:19:25,280 --> 00:19:27,600
so what we were doing was we were what i

616
00:19:27,600 --> 00:19:29,120
like to say we were using it like we

617
00:19:29,120 --> 00:19:31,120
would use uh waze on your phone like we

618
00:19:31,120 --> 00:19:32,240
were taking

619
00:19:32,240 --> 00:19:34,240
allowing people to take an alternate

620
00:19:34,240 --> 00:19:35,679
path maybe there's a different

621
00:19:35,679 --> 00:19:37,039
place that you want to go maybe you want

622
00:19:37,039 --> 00:19:39,200
to stop by and see something else which

623
00:19:39,200 --> 00:19:40,640
will give you an opportunity to learn

624
00:19:40,640 --> 00:19:41,679
along the way

625
00:19:41,679 --> 00:19:44,880
and as long as you're taking care of the

626
00:19:44,880 --> 00:19:46,720
right governance controls and doing the

627
00:19:46,720 --> 00:19:47,840
right things

628
00:19:47,840 --> 00:19:50,559
then we can make sure that we're

629
00:19:50,559 --> 00:19:52,080
providing you the support and the

630
00:19:52,080 --> 00:19:53,600
understanding that you need to be able

631
00:19:53,600 --> 00:19:54,000
to

632
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:57,280
move forward so

633
00:19:57,280 --> 00:19:59,039
that's that's all about automating

634
00:19:59,039 --> 00:20:00,960
governance so

635
00:20:00,960 --> 00:20:03,120
one of the principal points here is that

636
00:20:03,120 --> 00:20:04,640
it's not about

637
00:20:04,640 --> 00:20:07,120
keeping audit off your back it's about

638
00:20:07,120 --> 00:20:08,159
uh providing

639
00:20:08,159 --> 00:20:11,200
um it's not about having a checklist

640
00:20:11,200 --> 00:20:12,720
that we make sure has been checked it's

641
00:20:12,720 --> 00:20:13,360
about

642
00:20:13,360 --> 00:20:15,440
collaboratively making sure we're baking

643
00:20:15,440 --> 00:20:17,520
capabilities into the pipelines that

644
00:20:17,520 --> 00:20:18,960
we're delivering

645
00:20:18,960 --> 00:20:21,679
uh it make sure you start small don't

646
00:20:21,679 --> 00:20:23,280
try and boil the ocean and do everything

647
00:20:23,280 --> 00:20:24,320
all at once

648
00:20:24,320 --> 00:20:26,159
getting one team working we started with

649
00:20:26,159 --> 00:20:28,320
one pipeline across the organization to

650
00:20:28,320 --> 00:20:28,960
do

651
00:20:28,960 --> 00:20:32,240
a common use case um and we then

652
00:20:32,240 --> 00:20:36,000
iterated from there uh we also

653
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:38,159
spent a lot of time on engaging leaders

654
00:20:38,159 --> 00:20:39,200
focusing on

655
00:20:39,200 --> 00:20:41,039
conversation and not tooling to make

656
00:20:41,039 --> 00:20:42,400
sure that we were

657
00:20:42,400 --> 00:20:44,720
accessing the right outcomes and we were

658
00:20:44,720 --> 00:20:46,400
looking at the right things that we were

659
00:20:46,400 --> 00:20:48,320
working towards delivering the value

660
00:20:48,320 --> 00:20:49,840
that was actually truly going to help

661
00:20:49,840 --> 00:20:52,720
the organization

662
00:20:53,120 --> 00:20:55,440
um so that that's with all of that said

663
00:20:55,440 --> 00:20:56,960
then that's about what so we've talked

664
00:20:56,960 --> 00:20:58,799
about the introduction around devops

665
00:20:58,799 --> 00:21:01,760
and we've talked about the types of

666
00:21:01,760 --> 00:21:03,039
risks and how risk

667
00:21:03,039 --> 00:21:05,600
comes about talk about how we've could

668
00:21:05,600 --> 00:21:06,960
go about automating governance and

669
00:21:06,960 --> 00:21:08,400
things that we were doing in particular

670
00:21:08,400 --> 00:21:11,280
to automate governance into pipelines

671
00:21:11,280 --> 00:21:14,000
let's uh talk about well taco and how

672
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:14,320
that

673
00:21:14,320 --> 00:21:18,000
helped with all of this so

674
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:19,840
i realized having started to build out

675
00:21:19,840 --> 00:21:21,520
some more of these blueprints for

676
00:21:21,520 --> 00:21:24,799
pipelines there were some commonalities

677
00:21:24,799 --> 00:21:27,440
in what it was that we needed to deliver

678
00:21:27,440 --> 00:21:31,840
from the compliance point of view

679
00:21:33,200 --> 00:21:36,720
so from a modeling perspective

680
00:21:36,720 --> 00:21:40,000
we started to see that okay so as we

681
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:41,760
look at what we need to show from

682
00:21:41,760 --> 00:21:43,200
compliance the first part of this would

683
00:21:43,200 --> 00:21:44,400
be traceability

684
00:21:44,400 --> 00:21:46,320
we want to identify what happens in the

685
00:21:46,320 --> 00:21:48,640
pipe for that we wanted to understand

686
00:21:48,640 --> 00:21:49,760
chain of custody what

687
00:21:49,760 --> 00:21:52,000
test results deployed version is tracked

688
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:54,000
and how the change is recorded so making

689
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:55,520
sure that we understood

690
00:21:55,520 --> 00:21:58,480
all the way along the pipeline what was

691
00:21:58,480 --> 00:21:59,440
necessary

692
00:21:59,440 --> 00:22:02,240
uh to show that yes we understood what

693
00:22:02,240 --> 00:22:03,679
happened that nothing has changed they

694
00:22:03,679 --> 00:22:04,799
were delivering the thing that we said

695
00:22:04,799 --> 00:22:06,799
we were going to deliver

696
00:22:06,799 --> 00:22:09,360
we also we then went on to look at like

697
00:22:09,360 --> 00:22:11,200
access how do we secure the delivery

698
00:22:11,200 --> 00:22:13,039
process

699
00:22:13,039 --> 00:22:14,720
and for this we're looking at like who

700
00:22:14,720 --> 00:22:16,400
has access to the source code

701
00:22:16,400 --> 00:22:19,679
is creator checked um if we've got uh

702
00:22:19,679 --> 00:22:21,039
if we're building it once and playing

703
00:22:21,039 --> 00:22:22,400
many so we're not redoing the source

704
00:22:22,400 --> 00:22:23,760
code there's an opportunity to make

705
00:22:23,760 --> 00:22:24,880
changes that we're

706
00:22:24,880 --> 00:22:27,200
properly uh using hashes to demonstrate

707
00:22:27,200 --> 00:22:28,480
that what we're doing and that

708
00:22:28,480 --> 00:22:30,000
any deployments only come from the

709
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:33,120
pipelines so we were we were starting to

710
00:22:33,120 --> 00:22:35,039
to build out a set of models like if you

711
00:22:35,039 --> 00:22:36,559
want to be able to push things into

712
00:22:36,559 --> 00:22:37,520
production

713
00:22:37,520 --> 00:22:39,280
you need to be able to do all of these

714
00:22:39,280 --> 00:22:41,360
things um

715
00:22:41,360 --> 00:22:43,440
validating the uh payload in the

716
00:22:43,440 --> 00:22:44,480
pipeline so if

717
00:22:44,480 --> 00:22:45,679
we wanted to make sure there was a

718
00:22:45,679 --> 00:22:47,760
proper peer review that not it was

719
00:22:47,760 --> 00:22:49,120
we had to be able to show that

720
00:22:49,120 --> 00:22:51,039
segregation of duties that we were

721
00:22:51,039 --> 00:22:54,159
properly managing that and that we

722
00:22:54,159 --> 00:22:55,440
there was evidence of that being

723
00:22:55,440 --> 00:22:56,720
collected which we were doing through a

724
00:22:56,720 --> 00:22:57,760
variety of

725
00:22:57,760 --> 00:22:59,840
methods in terms of collecting logs

726
00:22:59,840 --> 00:23:01,200
showing that more than one person had

727
00:23:01,200 --> 00:23:02,080
been working on it

728
00:23:02,080 --> 00:23:05,360
and uh demonstrating that back uh for

729
00:23:05,360 --> 00:23:08,559
from an audit perspective uh we were

730
00:23:08,559 --> 00:23:11,120
scanning the code scanning the artifact

731
00:23:11,120 --> 00:23:13,039
bringing the integrations into the

732
00:23:13,039 --> 00:23:14,480
pipeline

733
00:23:14,480 --> 00:23:16,880
and making sure that the when we started

734
00:23:16,880 --> 00:23:17,520
to raise

735
00:23:17,520 --> 00:23:19,280
uh defects or problems from that that

736
00:23:19,280 --> 00:23:20,559
these were then

737
00:23:20,559 --> 00:23:22,559
being fed back into the delivery teams

738
00:23:22,559 --> 00:23:24,000
fixing and then tracking how many of

739
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:25,679
those were being fixed

740
00:23:25,679 --> 00:23:27,840
uh recording execution monitoring

741
00:23:27,840 --> 00:23:29,120
validating the target

742
00:23:29,120 --> 00:23:31,039
making sure that we're that we're not

743
00:23:31,039 --> 00:23:32,799
just deploying blindly that we

744
00:23:32,799 --> 00:23:34,559
understand that the target

745
00:23:34,559 --> 00:23:36,080
system is in the state that we expect it

746
00:23:36,080 --> 00:23:37,919
to be in uh validating the

747
00:23:37,919 --> 00:23:40,640
quality of uh what we're delivering and

748
00:23:40,640 --> 00:23:42,080
make sure the tests have been run that

749
00:23:42,080 --> 00:23:43,440
proper things have happened

750
00:23:43,440 --> 00:23:45,279
checking it works and then validating

751
00:23:45,279 --> 00:23:46,880
that the execution is actually

752
00:23:46,880 --> 00:23:49,360
behaving it was we also set up a set of

753
00:23:49,360 --> 00:23:51,279
auditing ones to validate that even

754
00:23:51,279 --> 00:23:53,360
these controls were then properly being

755
00:23:53,360 --> 00:23:54,320
implemented

756
00:23:54,320 --> 00:23:57,440
uh on each of the uh pipelines and then

757
00:23:57,440 --> 00:23:58,640
my daughter drew a

758
00:23:58,640 --> 00:24:00,480
lovely picture to help explain this as

759
00:24:00,480 --> 00:24:02,159
well which is uh

760
00:24:02,159 --> 00:24:04,960
the taco so traceability access

761
00:24:04,960 --> 00:24:06,480
compliance and operations

762
00:24:06,480 --> 00:24:09,440
and the the point here was to to give it

763
00:24:09,440 --> 00:24:11,039
a name like this was that it

764
00:24:11,039 --> 00:24:13,200
made a very useful monomic it made it

765
00:24:13,200 --> 00:24:14,640
very easy for

766
00:24:14,640 --> 00:24:16,159
all of the different teams remember my

767
00:24:16,159 --> 00:24:18,080
rosetta stone to be able to understand

768
00:24:18,080 --> 00:24:19,520
what it was we were talking about when

769
00:24:19,520 --> 00:24:21,760
we were delivering uh platform

770
00:24:21,760 --> 00:24:23,760
capabilities out to the delivery teams

771
00:24:23,760 --> 00:24:25,679
and we were delivering these pipelines

772
00:24:25,679 --> 00:24:27,600
they could understand that this is what

773
00:24:27,600 --> 00:24:29,679
i need to make sure i've taken care of

774
00:24:29,679 --> 00:24:30,400
these are

775
00:24:30,400 --> 00:24:32,080
the things i need to know rather than

776
00:24:32,080 --> 00:24:33,520
have to wade through

777
00:24:33,520 --> 00:24:36,000
hundreds of lines of documents and

778
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:37,679
hundreds and hundreds of controls

779
00:24:37,679 --> 00:24:39,600
i as long as i've taken care of these in

780
00:24:39,600 --> 00:24:41,840
my devops pipelines i know that i can

781
00:24:41,840 --> 00:24:45,120
my pipeline itself is secure

782
00:24:45,120 --> 00:24:47,200
but in order to help communicate with

783
00:24:47,200 --> 00:24:48,799
compliance scenes we also set this up in

784
00:24:48,799 --> 00:24:50,640
a very similar way or they were used to

785
00:24:50,640 --> 00:24:52,960
we had our initial version of this was

786
00:24:52,960 --> 00:24:54,080
as a spreadsheet

787
00:24:54,080 --> 00:24:56,799
which we then codified into a database

788
00:24:56,799 --> 00:24:58,480
and this was

789
00:24:58,480 --> 00:25:00,880
uh in in this format in terms of a what

790
00:25:00,880 --> 00:25:01,840
is the purpose of

791
00:25:01,840 --> 00:25:04,240
this what is control we're using for it

792
00:25:04,240 --> 00:25:04,880
what is the

793
00:25:04,880 --> 00:25:06,720
uh artifact that will be used to track

794
00:25:06,720 --> 00:25:08,000
it where's that stored

795
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:09,919
what happens in terms of a happy and the

796
00:25:09,919 --> 00:25:12,000
sad path if control is passed or control

797
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:12,640
is failed

798
00:25:12,640 --> 00:25:14,480
and who's going to own this and we

799
00:25:14,480 --> 00:25:16,320
documented each of the controls

800
00:25:16,320 --> 00:25:18,480
in this manner for i have for each of

801
00:25:18,480 --> 00:25:20,240
the purposes and then provided this as a

802
00:25:20,240 --> 00:25:22,400
spreadsheet out to the teams

803
00:25:22,400 --> 00:25:24,240
this also allowed us to very simply

804
00:25:24,240 --> 00:25:25,600
visualize it which is

805
00:25:25,600 --> 00:25:27,360
visualizations are a great way as well

806
00:25:27,360 --> 00:25:29,840
to help lock things into people's minds

807
00:25:29,840 --> 00:25:30,559
to help them

808
00:25:30,559 --> 00:25:32,559
visualize hey how much more of this do i

809
00:25:32,559 --> 00:25:35,039
have to do to get better

810
00:25:35,039 --> 00:25:38,159
um we we also set up some

811
00:25:38,159 --> 00:25:39,760
workshops and i did this with some

812
00:25:39,760 --> 00:25:41,360
subsequent work i did around

813
00:25:41,360 --> 00:25:43,360
if we take that tackle model and we look

814
00:25:43,360 --> 00:25:44,559
at how can we

815
00:25:44,559 --> 00:25:46,720
help understand and break this down and

816
00:25:46,720 --> 00:25:48,640
to systematically look at

817
00:25:48,640 --> 00:25:50,880
uh where do controls exist what sort of

818
00:25:50,880 --> 00:25:52,400
controls can we introduce into our

819
00:25:52,400 --> 00:25:53,360
pipeline where

820
00:25:53,360 --> 00:25:55,200
where can we manage these what might

821
00:25:55,200 --> 00:25:56,720
that look like and then

822
00:25:56,720 --> 00:25:58,400
working through this so we can say okay

823
00:25:58,400 --> 00:26:01,360
so for us to deliver what controls do we

824
00:26:01,360 --> 00:26:02,880
need and how are we going to manage

825
00:26:02,880 --> 00:26:04,320
those and where are we going to get the

826
00:26:04,320 --> 00:26:07,120
information from and radiate it back

827
00:26:07,120 --> 00:26:08,720
and this allowed us to like break this

828
00:26:08,720 --> 00:26:10,640
down in terms of what is the input and

829
00:26:10,640 --> 00:26:12,960
the output across each of these stages

830
00:26:12,960 --> 00:26:15,279
and how do we uh how do we have the

831
00:26:15,279 --> 00:26:16,559
discussion so

832
00:26:16,559 --> 00:26:19,279
this in as with a lot of these mapping

833
00:26:19,279 --> 00:26:20,240
exercises

834
00:26:20,240 --> 00:26:22,799
the value here was that by bringing

835
00:26:22,799 --> 00:26:24,080
security and compliance

836
00:26:24,080 --> 00:26:25,760
and the delivery team to the table to

837
00:26:25,760 --> 00:26:27,440
have this conversation

838
00:26:27,440 --> 00:26:29,360
we had a much more open conversation

839
00:26:29,360 --> 00:26:31,200
very quickly to come to an understanding

840
00:26:31,200 --> 00:26:31,679
of

841
00:26:31,679 --> 00:26:33,200
hey what do we need to do to move

842
00:26:33,200 --> 00:26:35,279
forward here and what things should we

843
00:26:35,279 --> 00:26:37,200
have in those places controls how if we

844
00:26:37,200 --> 00:26:38,400
properly uh

845
00:26:38,400 --> 00:26:41,760
and mitigated uh the the risks within

846
00:26:41,760 --> 00:26:44,879
the systems we're deploying

847
00:26:45,200 --> 00:26:46,880
if you took a really complicated look at

848
00:26:46,880 --> 00:26:48,320
it we started to build up pipelines that

849
00:26:48,320 --> 00:26:49,440
looked like this

850
00:26:49,440 --> 00:26:51,760
and which has got many many different

851
00:26:51,760 --> 00:26:53,679
control points

852
00:26:53,679 --> 00:26:56,480
which is far too complex to go through

853
00:26:56,480 --> 00:26:57,200
on a

854
00:26:57,200 --> 00:27:00,080
in a presentation deck like this but

855
00:27:00,080 --> 00:27:01,039
there's

856
00:27:01,039 --> 00:27:02,720
so if you think about this in terms of

857
00:27:02,720 --> 00:27:04,480
we're going to build validate test and

858
00:27:04,480 --> 00:27:05,279
deploy

859
00:27:05,279 --> 00:27:06,559
and we want to understand where those

860
00:27:06,559 --> 00:27:08,240
controls are and what happens if the

861
00:27:08,240 --> 00:27:09,360
controls fail

862
00:27:09,360 --> 00:27:12,320
um and by mapping it out this way we

863
00:27:12,320 --> 00:27:13,840
could very simply say

864
00:27:13,840 --> 00:27:15,440
okay if i if i understand what's

865
00:27:15,440 --> 00:27:17,120
happening at each phase of delivery and

866
00:27:17,120 --> 00:27:18,799
these are not gates these are just

867
00:27:18,799 --> 00:27:21,120
phases as we as we start to deliver i

868
00:27:21,120 --> 00:27:22,240
can now understand

869
00:27:22,240 --> 00:27:24,640
um also what happens where does it go

870
00:27:24,640 --> 00:27:26,159
who's going to respond to it how do i

871
00:27:26,159 --> 00:27:27,279
know what to do

872
00:27:27,279 --> 00:27:31,200
in the event of a failure an example

873
00:27:31,200 --> 00:27:32,799
very similar to this is capital one also

874
00:27:32,799 --> 00:27:34,480
has a like a list of

875
00:27:34,480 --> 00:27:35,760
these are the different things that need

876
00:27:35,760 --> 00:27:38,159
to happen along a given pipeline

877
00:27:38,159 --> 00:27:40,240
and this is they've got a link to an

878
00:27:40,240 --> 00:27:41,760
article that talks about each of these

879
00:27:41,760 --> 00:27:42,880
and how they're using it

880
00:27:42,880 --> 00:27:44,480
and they didn't give it a name like taco

881
00:27:44,480 --> 00:27:45,919
but they did something very similar

882
00:27:45,919 --> 00:27:50,080
as well uh another real world example

883
00:27:50,080 --> 00:27:52,480
is from nationwide building society and

884
00:27:52,480 --> 00:27:53,919
the bvssh

885
00:27:53,919 --> 00:27:55,679
community that i helped run in north

886
00:27:55,679 --> 00:27:57,039
america

887
00:27:57,039 --> 00:28:00,000
they had nationwide come and talk quite

888
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:02,000
recently in the talks that they gave

889
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:03,760
uh were great there was a series of

890
00:28:03,760 --> 00:28:05,520
ignite talks that and i think they also

891
00:28:05,520 --> 00:28:06,159
gave them in

892
00:28:06,159 --> 00:28:08,000
europe and it's a great video to watch

893
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:10,880
to see how their organization has

894
00:28:10,880 --> 00:28:13,919
started to automate governance into uh

895
00:28:13,919 --> 00:28:15,679
the into pipelines and how they've

896
00:28:15,679 --> 00:28:18,799
automated the delivery to make sure that

897
00:28:18,799 --> 00:28:20,399
it's easier for delivery teams to get

898
00:28:20,399 --> 00:28:22,159
the information they need in the context

899
00:28:22,159 --> 00:28:22,960
they need it

900
00:28:22,960 --> 00:28:26,640
to be able to make decisions faster

901
00:28:26,640 --> 00:28:29,039
and and also how they then displayed

902
00:28:29,039 --> 00:28:30,480
that information to make

903
00:28:30,480 --> 00:28:31,679
these in what they call these

904
00:28:31,679 --> 00:28:33,679
intelligent control boards um

905
00:28:33,679 --> 00:28:35,760
which give them a lot of insight into

906
00:28:35,760 --> 00:28:38,000
how things are occurring in terms of

907
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:39,279
management of risk through the different

908
00:28:39,279 --> 00:28:41,039
pipelines

909
00:28:41,039 --> 00:28:43,919
so to kind of wrap this up there's this

910
00:28:43,919 --> 00:28:46,240
idea that it's not really about devops

911
00:28:46,240 --> 00:28:49,279
or even really dev secops it's really

912
00:28:49,279 --> 00:28:50,000
about

913
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:52,799
a risk dev risk ops risk like risk is

914
00:28:52,799 --> 00:28:53,520
part of

915
00:28:53,520 --> 00:28:55,440
all throughout the entire system we need

916
00:28:55,440 --> 00:28:56,640
to make sure that we're we're

917
00:28:56,640 --> 00:28:57,679
considering this

918
00:28:57,679 --> 00:28:58,960
from the beginning that we're

919
00:28:58,960 --> 00:29:01,039
considering as we start to deploy things

920
00:29:01,039 --> 00:29:02,399
and we're considering it

921
00:29:02,399 --> 00:29:03,760
uh all the way at the end to make sure

922
00:29:03,760 --> 00:29:06,080
that our entire end-to-end system

923
00:29:06,080 --> 00:29:07,600
we're understanding considering what the

924
00:29:07,600 --> 00:29:09,440
risks are and putting the appropriate

925
00:29:09,440 --> 00:29:12,559
control piece in place so now let's wrap

926
00:29:12,559 --> 00:29:12,880
up

927
00:29:12,880 --> 00:29:15,679
and uh go through the quick q a so we

928
00:29:15,679 --> 00:29:16,960
can't solve the same problems with the

929
00:29:16,960 --> 00:29:18,799
same thing can we use to create them

930
00:29:18,799 --> 00:29:21,679
here are some great references uh that

931
00:29:21,679 --> 00:29:23,279
i'd highly recommend

932
00:29:23,279 --> 00:29:25,520
reading and a lot of the the content in

933
00:29:25,520 --> 00:29:26,720
this talk um

934
00:29:26,720 --> 00:29:30,000
comes from these places and so let's

935
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:31,279
review

936
00:29:31,279 --> 00:29:32,799
uh what we've gone through is there's a

937
00:29:32,799 --> 00:29:34,399
common way of understanding

938
00:29:34,399 --> 00:29:36,320
what a good pipeline is a good uh

939
00:29:36,320 --> 00:29:37,840
well-governed pipeline

940
00:29:37,840 --> 00:29:39,520
so this is how we can go about creating

941
00:29:39,520 --> 00:29:42,159
it using a manomic like taco or come up

942
00:29:42,159 --> 00:29:44,080
with your own anomic or expand

943
00:29:44,080 --> 00:29:46,559
upon that is a great way of giving a

944
00:29:46,559 --> 00:29:47,440
common

945
00:29:47,440 --> 00:29:49,520
understanding in the organization across

946
00:29:49,520 --> 00:29:50,799
all of these different areas that are

947
00:29:50,799 --> 00:29:52,880
all talking different languages

948
00:29:52,880 --> 00:29:56,000
as to what is it we need to do

949
00:29:56,000 --> 00:29:57,520
to make sure that we're doing the right

950
00:29:57,520 --> 00:29:59,520
thing

951
00:29:59,520 --> 00:30:01,760
safety is about behavior not just tools

952
00:30:01,760 --> 00:30:03,520
and it's this

953
00:30:03,520 --> 00:30:05,440
by having these conversations and

954
00:30:05,440 --> 00:30:07,200
talking about these pieces

955
00:30:07,200 --> 00:30:08,799
they don't get swept under the rug and

956
00:30:08,799 --> 00:30:10,320
we don't make assumptions because it's

957
00:30:10,320 --> 00:30:11,919
too difficult or we're rushing or we're

958
00:30:11,919 --> 00:30:12,559
trying to put

959
00:30:12,559 --> 00:30:14,960
something through and we we also don't

960
00:30:14,960 --> 00:30:16,799
end up slowing things down when we don't

961
00:30:16,799 --> 00:30:18,720
need to

962
00:30:18,720 --> 00:30:20,880
uh that has to there's lots of different

963
00:30:20,880 --> 00:30:22,320
ways to help automate

964
00:30:22,320 --> 00:30:24,880
software delivery compliance and uh

965
00:30:24,880 --> 00:30:26,399
hopefully some of the pieces in here has

966
00:30:26,399 --> 00:30:27,840
given you some ideas from like the

967
00:30:27,840 --> 00:30:29,600
people in process ways how to start

968
00:30:29,600 --> 00:30:30,960
conversations and

969
00:30:30,960 --> 00:30:33,520
talk about uh different ways of managing

970
00:30:33,520 --> 00:30:36,240
uh compliance in the pipelines and

971
00:30:36,240 --> 00:30:38,399
and the it's all about creating that

972
00:30:38,399 --> 00:30:40,000
common language around this and that's

973
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:41,919
what uh taco is for

974
00:30:41,919 --> 00:30:44,480
and so thank you very much um it's been

975
00:30:44,480 --> 00:30:46,320
a pleasure and i hope you enjoyed the

976
00:30:46,320 --> 00:30:48,159
rest of the conference there's a quick

977
00:30:48,159 --> 00:30:50,320
survey here if anybody

978
00:30:50,320 --> 00:30:52,080
wants to do it i'm always happy to get

979
00:30:52,080 --> 00:30:53,360
feedback and

980
00:30:53,360 --> 00:30:55,360
happy to chat some more about this stuff

981
00:30:55,360 --> 00:31:03,120
thank you very much
