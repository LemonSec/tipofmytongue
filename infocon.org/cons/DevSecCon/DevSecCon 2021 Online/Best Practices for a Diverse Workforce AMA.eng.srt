6
00:00:12,480 --> 00:00:13,920

some of the themes as we feel like

13
00:00:25,039 --> 00:00:26,400
they're really pertinent for everyone in

14
00:00:26,400 --> 00:00:27,199
our industry

15
00:00:27,199 --> 00:00:29,119
to have a sense for my name is brian

17
00:00:31,279 --> 00:00:32,640

00:00:34,079 --> 00:00:37,360
uh and operating and and mental model

20
00:00:37,360 --> 00:00:40,000
here at sneak where we're focused a lot

21
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:41,920
on advancing further diversity equity

22
00:00:41,920 --> 00:00:43,440
and inclusion across our industry

23
00:00:43,440 --> 00:00:45,200

organizations that are positively

26
00:00:48,480 --> 00:00:49,760
affecting society

27
00:00:49,760 --> 00:00:52,879
so the theme here for this discussion

28
00:00:52,879 --> 00:00:53,280

uh working with underrepresented

00:01:49,360 --> 00:01:51,439
candidates reducing the unconscious bias

59
00:01:51,439 --> 00:01:52,560
that can exist

at the organization

66
00:02:05,920 --> 00:02:08,959
even stronger more inclusive

67
00:02:08,959 --> 00:02:10,399
these two as we were warming up for

68
00:02:10,399 --> 00:02:12,319
today's session had said they'd never

69
00:02:12,319 --> 00:02:14,000
been busier i know that we as a company

70
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:15,599
have gone from a couple hundred

71
00:02:15,599 --> 00:02:18,160
sneakers to 700 plus sneakers in only

72
00:02:18,160 --> 00:02:20,080
about two years two and a half years

73
00:02:20,080 --> 00:02:23,040
and so really wanted to to give props to

74
00:02:23,040 --> 00:02:25,599
taiwo for different programs that have

75
00:02:25,599 --> 00:02:28,160
i would say emboldened our outreach

76
00:02:28,160 --> 00:02:29,760
programs and centered

77
00:02:29,760 --> 00:02:31,519
uh more of our focus on creating jobs

78
00:02:31,519 --> 00:02:33,440
for underrepresented groups

79
00:02:33,440 --> 00:02:35,120
and make certain that our teams aren't

80
00:02:35,120 --> 00:02:36,959
homogeneous as we all know diverse teams

81
00:02:36,959 --> 00:02:39,040
are are those that are performing better

82
00:02:39,040 --> 00:02:41,599
uh creating uh better decision-making

83
00:02:41,599 --> 00:02:42,640
patterns

84
00:02:42,640 --> 00:02:46,239
uh typically more deeply um uh connected

85
00:02:46,239 --> 00:02:47,440
to the work that they're doing in their

86
00:02:47,440 --> 00:02:48,879
colleagues and doing their best work and

87
00:02:48,879 --> 00:02:50,319
so that's what we're we're working on

88
00:02:50,319 --> 00:02:52,080
here today i would open by just asking

89
00:02:52,080 --> 00:02:53,360
heidi can you tell us more about

90
00:02:53,360 --> 00:02:56,239
why you come to this work uh of making

91
00:02:56,239 --> 00:02:56,800
certain that

92
00:02:56,800 --> 00:02:59,680
our people practices here are inclusive

93
00:02:59,680 --> 00:03:01,280
and and promoting inclusion

94
00:03:01,280 --> 00:03:04,319
and belonging absolutely well i think

95
00:03:04,319 --> 00:03:06,959
sneakers one of those companies who

96
00:03:06,959 --> 00:03:09,200
going through that startup environment

97
00:03:09,200 --> 00:03:12,400
um growing on a huge huge trajectory

98
00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:12,800
right

99
00:03:12,800 --> 00:03:14,879
you know i think we've grown what 400

100
00:03:14,879 --> 00:03:16,480
it's absolute madness

101
00:03:16,480 --> 00:03:18,400
and i think it's just about promoting

102
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:20,480
that inclusive environment of equal

103
00:03:20,480 --> 00:03:21,760
opportunity

104
00:03:21,760 --> 00:03:24,400
um you know it's it's constantly

105
00:03:24,400 --> 00:03:26,400
delivering those results to make sure

106
00:03:26,400 --> 00:03:27,120
that we are

107
00:03:27,120 --> 00:03:30,159
a part of dni and not just using it as

108
00:03:30,159 --> 00:03:31,760
you know oh yeah we've got a dni

109
00:03:31,760 --> 00:03:34,319
practice but actually not living by it

110
00:03:34,319 --> 00:03:36,319
um and it's just being that advocate

111
00:03:36,319 --> 00:03:37,920
internally to make sure that everyone

112
00:03:37,920 --> 00:03:39,920
stays on that same path

113
00:03:39,920 --> 00:03:42,239
um and offer advice i suppose and

114
00:03:42,239 --> 00:03:43,760
structure to people who

115
00:03:43,760 --> 00:03:45,599
might be new to it you know it's just

116
00:03:45,599 --> 00:03:47,280
offering that ability to say yeah i'm

117
00:03:47,280 --> 00:03:48,480
here to help you

118
00:03:48,480 --> 00:03:50,400
maybe give you ideas and just help keep

119
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:52,239
you on that path as well

120
00:03:52,239 --> 00:03:54,720
and you were you were you were seeing

121
00:03:54,720 --> 00:03:56,239
some of the work that was occurring here

122
00:03:56,239 --> 00:03:56,799
and said

123
00:03:56,799 --> 00:03:58,400
i i know that that's going to be a place

124
00:03:58,400 --> 00:03:59,680
that's receptive to this this

125
00:03:59,680 --> 00:04:01,120
perspective this way of operating is

126
00:04:01,120 --> 00:04:02,480
that is that kind of the

127
00:04:02,480 --> 00:04:03,760
the why it was a culture fit when you

128
00:04:03,760 --> 00:04:05,680
were looking to join here

129
00:04:05,680 --> 00:04:08,480
absolutely i joined as a as a contractor

130
00:04:08,480 --> 00:04:08,720
and

131
00:04:08,720 --> 00:04:10,239
when you're contracting you you know

132
00:04:10,239 --> 00:04:12,319
you've got to go so quick and you're

133
00:04:12,319 --> 00:04:14,560
you're working at pace but yet even at

134
00:04:14,560 --> 00:04:15,920
that pace it was

135
00:04:15,920 --> 00:04:17,839
right let's always take that step back

136
00:04:17,839 --> 00:04:19,120
and focus on what

137
00:04:19,120 --> 00:04:20,320
you know what are we looking at we're

138
00:04:20,320 --> 00:04:21,680
looking at underrepresented talent

139
00:04:21,680 --> 00:04:22,880
especially go to market

140
00:04:22,880 --> 00:04:24,960
tech sales you know we don't do college

141
00:04:24,960 --> 00:04:26,960
courses on this we don't have the u.s

142
00:04:26,960 --> 00:04:27,520
central

143
00:04:27,520 --> 00:04:29,840
attitude towards sales it's right where

144
00:04:29,840 --> 00:04:31,360
can we lean for talent

145
00:04:31,360 --> 00:04:34,880
sales females it's a very very under

146
00:04:34,880 --> 00:04:37,280
stated arena you know getting sales

147
00:04:37,280 --> 00:04:38,000
women

148
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:40,240
um or you know non-binary whichever way

149
00:04:40,240 --> 00:04:41,280
wouldn't look at it

150
00:04:41,280 --> 00:04:43,360
trying to get them into the workplace

151
00:04:43,360 --> 00:04:45,840
and give them the best shot

152
00:04:45,840 --> 00:04:47,919
it is the way that sneak has always been

153
00:04:47,919 --> 00:04:50,320
at the forefront of that you know it's

154
00:04:50,320 --> 00:04:52,560
okay what can we do we shout about

155
00:04:52,560 --> 00:04:54,160
initiatives things like you don't have

156
00:04:54,160 --> 00:04:56,000
to take every box we're willing to have

157
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:58,000
those conversations and invest in you

158
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:00,240
when you see that you really want to be

159
00:05:00,240 --> 00:05:01,120
a part of it

160
00:05:01,120 --> 00:05:04,880
and i suppose navigate around that

161
00:05:04,880 --> 00:05:06,560
i really appreciate hearing it and and

162
00:05:06,560 --> 00:05:08,000
then people get uh

163
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:09,520
that are listening to today's panel get

164
00:05:09,520 --> 00:05:11,039
a chance to know your perspective just a

165
00:05:11,039 --> 00:05:12,320
little bit more on what those are rooted

166
00:05:12,320 --> 00:05:12,800
in so

167
00:05:12,800 --> 00:05:15,199
taiwa over to you what what is it that

168
00:05:15,199 --> 00:05:16,880
drives you to be more inclusive in the

169
00:05:16,880 --> 00:05:18,320
work that you're doing here and

170
00:05:18,320 --> 00:05:20,240
and then maybe just a word on on why it

171
00:05:20,240 --> 00:05:21,360
made sense for you to join this

172
00:05:21,360 --> 00:05:22,880
organization this rocket ship that we're

173
00:05:22,880 --> 00:05:23,520
all work

174
00:05:23,520 --> 00:05:26,400
a part of yeah um i'll start from the

175
00:05:26,400 --> 00:05:28,160
bottom up actually um so my story is

176
00:05:28,160 --> 00:05:29,759
actually very similar to heidi's in the

177
00:05:29,759 --> 00:05:30,720
sense that

178
00:05:30,720 --> 00:05:33,520
um we both started off as contractors um

179
00:05:33,520 --> 00:05:34,320
and i think

180
00:05:34,320 --> 00:05:36,080
you know i her time was probably

181
00:05:36,080 --> 00:05:37,440
different to mine in a sense that we

182
00:05:37,440 --> 00:05:39,600
were probably just like 150

183
00:05:39,600 --> 00:05:42,800
as a business um and um we were

184
00:05:42,800 --> 00:05:44,479
trying to scale up at the time and run

185
00:05:44,479 --> 00:05:46,639
at a bit more pace than we were going

186
00:05:46,639 --> 00:05:48,240
uh but it's similar in the sense of you

187
00:05:48,240 --> 00:05:49,600
know you come in you do a job and you

188
00:05:49,600 --> 00:05:51,520
just want to sort of get that done

189
00:05:51,520 --> 00:05:53,280
i think what made sense for me to join

190
00:05:53,280 --> 00:05:54,960
was um sneak

191
00:05:54,960 --> 00:05:57,520
catching the importance of

192
00:05:57,520 --> 00:05:58,560
representation

193
00:05:58,560 --> 00:06:01,520
um inclusion and diversity at a very

194
00:06:01,520 --> 00:06:02,639
critical time

195
00:06:02,639 --> 00:06:04,639
um it was a time where we really wanted

196
00:06:04,639 --> 00:06:06,479
to blast off and

197
00:06:06,479 --> 00:06:09,199
um you know when you talk about these

198
00:06:09,199 --> 00:06:10,800
groups that are quite underrepresented

199
00:06:10,800 --> 00:06:13,840
it's a it's a it's a building it's a

200
00:06:13,840 --> 00:06:15,039
project in itself to just

201
00:06:15,039 --> 00:06:17,440
build the pipeline to even just get you

202
00:06:17,440 --> 00:06:19,600
um the sort of talent you're looking for

203
00:06:19,600 --> 00:06:20,080
um

204
00:06:20,080 --> 00:06:21,919
and so to slaughter for sneaker a

205
00:06:21,919 --> 00:06:23,759
company that wants a scale to slow down

206
00:06:23,759 --> 00:06:24,720
and say actually

207
00:06:24,720 --> 00:06:26,000
we don't want to be in a place in a

208
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:28,240
year's time where we yes we've hit 700

209
00:06:28,240 --> 00:06:29,120
people

210
00:06:29,120 --> 00:06:30,319
but you know there's a you know there's

211
00:06:30,319 --> 00:06:32,240
no representation there's no diversity

212
00:06:32,240 --> 00:06:33,600
there's no inclusion

213
00:06:33,600 --> 00:06:36,639
um so you know for me seeing that as a

214
00:06:36,639 --> 00:06:37,440
contractor

215
00:06:37,440 --> 00:06:39,440
when i was offered my role here to help

216
00:06:39,440 --> 00:06:41,440
build that initiative as well

217
00:06:41,440 --> 00:06:44,639
um i didn't think twice right um and

218
00:06:44,639 --> 00:06:46,720
um you know it's been a great journey

219
00:06:46,720 --> 00:06:48,639
since because whether it's

220
00:06:48,639 --> 00:06:51,199
within my team experts like heidi heidi

221
00:06:51,199 --> 00:06:52,639
is actually the expert

222
00:06:52,639 --> 00:06:54,560
um are being brought in on a day-to-day

223
00:06:54,560 --> 00:06:55,840
basis um

224
00:06:55,840 --> 00:06:58,240
and um you know you just get to see the

225
00:06:58,240 --> 00:07:00,160
changes being implemented and it's not

226
00:07:00,160 --> 00:07:02,160
just a tick box exercise

227
00:07:02,160 --> 00:07:03,840
um but i'm you know i'm really

228
00:07:03,840 --> 00:07:05,440
passionate about it because represent

229
00:07:05,440 --> 00:07:07,120
you know i've worked in a lot of other

230
00:07:07,120 --> 00:07:09,199
startups where it's an afterthought

231
00:07:09,199 --> 00:07:10,800
it's something that you take a box with

232
00:07:10,800 --> 00:07:12,400
and you don't see the action

233
00:07:12,400 --> 00:07:15,039
uh behind the sort of um the talk should

234
00:07:15,039 --> 00:07:16,720
i say uh but i feel like sneakers

235
00:07:16,720 --> 00:07:17,280
definitely

236
00:07:17,280 --> 00:07:18,720
gone the extra mile to make sure that

237
00:07:18,720 --> 00:07:20,560
we're not just ticking a box here

238
00:07:20,560 --> 00:07:22,240
where we know we're holding ourselves to

239
00:07:22,240 --> 00:07:24,400
a high standard um and we're making sure

240
00:07:24,400 --> 00:07:25,919
that we're bringing the best talent but

241
00:07:25,919 --> 00:07:27,280
also trying to

242
00:07:27,280 --> 00:07:29,759
um create opportunities for people who

243
00:07:29,759 --> 00:07:30,880
actually feel like well

244
00:07:30,880 --> 00:07:32,400
you know i'm in an industry where

245
00:07:32,400 --> 00:07:34,880
typically it's driven by men it's driven

246
00:07:34,880 --> 00:07:35,680
by

247
00:07:35,680 --> 00:07:38,880
a particular type of man even um and

248
00:07:38,880 --> 00:07:41,120
um you know how do we break those modes

249
00:07:41,120 --> 00:07:42,160
it's by creating

250
00:07:42,160 --> 00:07:43,360
things from the ground up so that we

251
00:07:43,360 --> 00:07:45,280
actually help people on a career

252
00:07:45,280 --> 00:07:47,280
trajectory that would see them go from

253
00:07:47,280 --> 00:07:49,520
i knew nothing and now i'm an expert

254
00:07:49,520 --> 00:07:51,199
amazing

255
00:07:51,199 --> 00:07:53,280
on the daily basis i think there's lots

256
00:07:53,280 --> 00:07:55,280
of peers of sneaks in the industry who

257
00:07:55,280 --> 00:07:56,479
have the intent

258
00:07:56,479 --> 00:07:58,400
as we've all spoken about before to

259
00:07:58,400 --> 00:08:00,080
diversify their teams and

260
00:08:00,080 --> 00:08:01,520
and and now it's a little bit less about

261
00:08:01,520 --> 00:08:03,199
the why we should diversify the teams

262
00:08:03,199 --> 00:08:04,240
even though

263
00:08:04,240 --> 00:08:05,440
some people have yet to read their

264
00:08:05,440 --> 00:08:07,520
research they've yet to understand that

265
00:08:07,520 --> 00:08:09,039
the science that that really

266
00:08:09,039 --> 00:08:12,080
bears that that that you know

267
00:08:12,080 --> 00:08:15,039
aspiration out as as being a a thing to

268
00:08:15,039 --> 00:08:16,879
do but but but the question is

269
00:08:16,879 --> 00:08:19,039
the how and so i think that for the next

270
00:08:19,039 --> 00:08:20,800
15 or so minutes on this

271
00:08:20,800 --> 00:08:22,319
on this best practice session let's

272
00:08:22,319 --> 00:08:24,560
start with what should you first

273
00:08:24,560 --> 00:08:26,960
you know focus on yeah and whichever of

274
00:08:26,960 --> 00:08:28,560
you wants to to run with this question

275
00:08:28,560 --> 00:08:30,080
but i would imagine a handful of years

276
00:08:30,080 --> 00:08:30,560
ago

277
00:08:30,560 --> 00:08:32,080
sneak was saying where do we even start

278
00:08:32,080 --> 00:08:34,159
we want to be diverse from when we're

279
00:08:34,159 --> 00:08:36,719
100 or less all the way through the

280
00:08:36,719 --> 00:08:37,519
journey

281
00:08:37,519 --> 00:08:39,599
um you know what what's the first step

282
00:08:39,599 --> 00:08:41,360
that an organization should focus on

283
00:08:41,360 --> 00:08:43,839
to uh to to really pursue a world-class

284
00:08:43,839 --> 00:08:44,480
dni

285
00:08:44,480 --> 00:08:47,120
or inclusive hiring yeah i'll give you a

286
00:08:47,120 --> 00:08:47,760
brief

287
00:08:47,760 --> 00:08:49,279
overview because like you said you know

288
00:08:49,279 --> 00:08:50,959
i probably started earlier but i feel

289
00:08:50,959 --> 00:08:52,560
like you know heidi will have a very

290
00:08:52,560 --> 00:08:53,279
clear

291
00:08:53,279 --> 00:08:55,519
answer on this but i think for me you

292
00:08:55,519 --> 00:08:56,880
know when we were at a place where i was

293
00:08:56,880 --> 00:08:58,399
like okay how do we diversify the

294
00:08:58,399 --> 00:08:59,680
workforce it was okay let's

295
00:08:59,680 --> 00:09:01,760
just educate ourselves right let's let's

296
00:09:01,760 --> 00:09:03,200
talk about these things internally

297
00:09:03,200 --> 00:09:05,040
let's have have the hard conversation

298
00:09:05,040 --> 00:09:07,680
sorry um and then see how that drives

299
00:09:07,680 --> 00:09:08,160
our

300
00:09:08,160 --> 00:09:09,279
you know let's let's see actually if

301
00:09:09,279 --> 00:09:11,120
there's a real desire for people to make

302
00:09:11,120 --> 00:09:12,399
these changes

303
00:09:12,399 --> 00:09:14,240
um and i think that was the first thing

304
00:09:14,240 --> 00:09:15,920
we did was educate ourselves um

305
00:09:15,920 --> 00:09:18,560
and then i honestly was interacting with

306
00:09:18,560 --> 00:09:20,000
other people as well how do you do these

307
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:21,200
things that you know we're not if we're

308
00:09:21,200 --> 00:09:22,640
not if we're asking ourselves

309
00:09:22,640 --> 00:09:24,080
um if we're having to educate ourselves

310
00:09:24,080 --> 00:09:26,000
that means we don't know it right so

311
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:27,680
um asking people who actually have a

312
00:09:27,680 --> 00:09:29,279
diverse workforce and that educating

313
00:09:29,279 --> 00:09:30,880
ourselves through that way as well

314
00:09:30,880 --> 00:09:33,279
um was very important um and not just

315
00:09:33,279 --> 00:09:34,880
assuming that because you know

316
00:09:34,880 --> 00:09:36,399
you know i'm a black recruiter i know

317
00:09:36,399 --> 00:09:38,399
how to hire black people into tech

318
00:09:38,399 --> 00:09:40,399
or you know because he's a woman she

319
00:09:40,399 --> 00:09:41,519
must know how to do it

320
00:09:41,519 --> 00:09:43,360
it's actually there must be a more

321
00:09:43,360 --> 00:09:45,120
careful tailored approach to

322
00:09:45,120 --> 00:09:48,880
actually approaching um dna um

323
00:09:48,880 --> 00:09:50,480
i appreciate that through through

324
00:09:50,480 --> 00:09:52,399
self-education through benchmarking

325
00:09:52,399 --> 00:09:54,080
through reaching out to peers to being

326
00:09:54,080 --> 00:09:54,959
humble

327
00:09:54,959 --> 00:09:56,640
to not pretending to know everything and

328
00:09:56,640 --> 00:09:58,240
remaining closed but remaining open

329
00:09:58,240 --> 00:09:59,920
heidi what what would you suggest for

330
00:09:59,920 --> 00:10:01,360
other companies listening

331
00:10:01,360 --> 00:10:03,120
that are that are that are now on that

332
00:10:03,120 --> 00:10:04,480
beginning of that journey

333
00:10:04,480 --> 00:10:06,800
yep taiwa on the head right it's

334
00:10:06,800 --> 00:10:08,959
education around inclusiveness it's

335
00:10:08,959 --> 00:10:09,839
assessing

336
00:10:09,839 --> 00:10:12,160
right where is id and i at right now

337
00:10:12,160 --> 00:10:14,640
raising awareness it's looking at then

338
00:10:14,640 --> 00:10:16,240
what are the areas that you want to

339
00:10:16,240 --> 00:10:18,160
focus on from that you don't want to

340
00:10:18,160 --> 00:10:20,720
tackle everything at first

341
00:10:20,720 --> 00:10:22,079
right we're going to we're going to get

342
00:10:22,079 --> 00:10:23,519
more races we're going to look at

343
00:10:23,519 --> 00:10:24,800
ethnicity we're going to

344
00:10:24,800 --> 00:10:26,240
look at gender now we're going to look

345
00:10:26,240 --> 00:10:28,320
at disability now we're going to look at

346
00:10:28,320 --> 00:10:29,680
you know all of these different

347
00:10:29,680 --> 00:10:31,360
backgrounds and you think actually no

348
00:10:31,360 --> 00:10:32,800
let's just have a look at what are we

349
00:10:32,800 --> 00:10:34,160
focusing on first

350
00:10:34,160 --> 00:10:36,399
how do we then look at what we're doing

351
00:10:36,399 --> 00:10:38,480
is it that we are not looking at a

352
00:10:38,480 --> 00:10:40,399
um you know different genders because we

353
00:10:40,399 --> 00:10:42,240
have unconscious bias okay let's focus

354
00:10:42,240 --> 00:10:44,160
on unconscious bias is it

355
00:10:44,160 --> 00:10:46,079
okay i'm not looking at people maybe

356
00:10:46,079 --> 00:10:47,519
from an underrepresented background

357
00:10:47,519 --> 00:10:48,959
because i don't have that cultural

358
00:10:48,959 --> 00:10:51,040
awareness okay then we need to focus on

359
00:10:51,040 --> 00:10:52,160
cultural awareness

360
00:10:52,160 --> 00:10:54,399
so it's not trying to tick off every

361
00:10:54,399 --> 00:10:56,079
single item at the beginning

362
00:10:56,079 --> 00:10:59,279
it's doing a dni survey taking in the

363
00:10:59,279 --> 00:11:00,720
information

364
00:11:00,720 --> 00:11:02,560
receiving the feedback of what's most

365
00:11:02,560 --> 00:11:04,399
important to the people who are in the

366
00:11:04,399 --> 00:11:05,680
business right now

367
00:11:05,680 --> 00:11:07,760
and then it's focusing on each step as

368
00:11:07,760 --> 00:11:09,360
you go that's the only way that you're

369
00:11:09,360 --> 00:11:10,800
going to kick off those foundational

370
00:11:10,800 --> 00:11:11,920
movements

371
00:11:11,920 --> 00:11:14,000
so it felt to me like you you have a gut

372
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:15,200
check

373
00:11:15,200 --> 00:11:16,720
initially you have you have like you're

374
00:11:16,720 --> 00:11:18,800
looking around oh wait the team is not

375
00:11:18,800 --> 00:11:21,519
that diverse the team must have walls

376
00:11:21,519 --> 00:11:23,200
built around it or people may be falling

377
00:11:23,200 --> 00:11:24,079
into old

378
00:11:24,079 --> 00:11:25,760
default patterns of just hiring those

379
00:11:25,760 --> 00:11:27,760
that that they've gone to school with or

380
00:11:27,760 --> 00:11:28,320
that they

381
00:11:28,320 --> 00:11:30,320
that whatever it was you you've not

382
00:11:30,320 --> 00:11:31,920
interrupted pattern enough to

383
00:11:31,920 --> 00:11:34,800
to move into a a more diverse or more

384
00:11:34,800 --> 00:11:35,760
inclusive

385
00:11:35,760 --> 00:11:38,000
approach and it sounds like education

386
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:40,560
internally externally with partners

387
00:11:40,560 --> 00:11:43,279
with others that are doing uh diverse

388
00:11:43,279 --> 00:11:45,279
and inclusive hiring well

389
00:11:45,279 --> 00:11:46,560
it was important but then i heard

390
00:11:46,560 --> 00:11:49,600
quantification and prioritization

391
00:11:49,600 --> 00:11:51,680
uh any any thoughts then on on the way

392
00:11:51,680 --> 00:11:54,000
that ongoing efforts as you've now begun

393
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:56,320
to quantify oh wait we are light

394
00:11:56,320 --> 00:11:59,680
in areas that we are that were that were

395
00:11:59,680 --> 00:12:02,399
proposing that were that were making uh

396
00:12:02,399 --> 00:12:03,360
progress against

397
00:12:03,360 --> 00:12:05,760
is there an ongoing series of decisions

398
00:12:05,760 --> 00:12:06,399
or thoughts

399
00:12:06,399 --> 00:12:09,519
or programming um focus areas that that

400
00:12:09,519 --> 00:12:10,880
y'all would like to share

401
00:12:10,880 --> 00:12:12,639
for folks that maybe haven't begun to

402
00:12:12,639 --> 00:12:14,079
educate they've gotten their employees

403
00:12:14,079 --> 00:12:15,519
involved in this they realize it's

404
00:12:15,519 --> 00:12:16,320
priority

405
00:12:16,320 --> 00:12:17,760
they've started to quantify and realize

406
00:12:17,760 --> 00:12:18,800
their numbers aren't quite where they

407
00:12:18,800 --> 00:12:20,399
want them what what types of decisions

408
00:12:20,399 --> 00:12:22,880
they need to make at that point

409
00:12:22,880 --> 00:12:24,880
yep i'll take this one so you've got to

410
00:12:24,880 --> 00:12:26,320
i think you've got to divide it into two

411
00:12:26,320 --> 00:12:28,639
right it's recruit and then retain

412
00:12:28,639 --> 00:12:30,480
so number one what are your efforts to

413
00:12:30,480 --> 00:12:31,839
attract and to recruit

414
00:12:31,839 --> 00:12:33,519
and then what is what are your actual

415
00:12:33,519 --> 00:12:35,680
ongoing efforts look like from

416
00:12:35,680 --> 00:12:38,320
um identification and retention right

417
00:12:38,320 --> 00:12:39,680
there needs to be a growth area

418
00:12:39,680 --> 00:12:41,120
internally as well

419
00:12:41,120 --> 00:12:44,000
so i think um you know those two areas

420
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:45,680
are really how you how you need to

421
00:12:45,680 --> 00:12:46,800
divide it

422
00:12:46,800 --> 00:12:49,360
um the the ongoing things that you need

423
00:12:49,360 --> 00:12:51,440
to focus on or that i think we focused

424
00:12:51,440 --> 00:12:52,079
on really

425
00:12:52,079 --> 00:12:54,399
well is from the beginning is everything

426
00:12:54,399 --> 00:12:56,240
around you know how i mentioned a second

427
00:12:56,240 --> 00:12:56,959
ago

428
00:12:56,959 --> 00:12:59,360
unconscious bias we focused on having an

429
00:12:59,360 --> 00:13:00,320
internal

430
00:13:00,320 --> 00:13:02,480
guide um which we have all of our hiring

431
00:13:02,480 --> 00:13:04,399
managers sign up to which is

432
00:13:04,399 --> 00:13:07,519
i promise to um be unbiased i promise to

433
00:13:07,519 --> 00:13:10,639
come in with my best mind i promise to

434
00:13:10,639 --> 00:13:13,279
explore all questions i promise to you

435
00:13:13,279 --> 00:13:15,040
know basically give their best to the

436
00:13:15,040 --> 00:13:17,680
candidate and be a diversity champion

437
00:13:17,680 --> 00:13:20,079
um on the attraction areas we shout

438
00:13:20,079 --> 00:13:21,200
about what we have

439
00:13:21,200 --> 00:13:23,519
on on offer here at sneak you know how i

440
00:13:23,519 --> 00:13:25,760
mentioned about women in sales we are

441
00:13:25,760 --> 00:13:26,639
very much

442
00:13:26,639 --> 00:13:28,880
hey we understand that women love to

443
00:13:28,880 --> 00:13:30,959
tick every box before they apply for a

444
00:13:30,959 --> 00:13:31,519
role

445
00:13:31,519 --> 00:13:33,519
actually here at sneak you don't need to

446
00:13:33,519 --> 00:13:36,320
do that we will absolutely invest back

447
00:13:36,320 --> 00:13:36,800
in you

448
00:13:36,800 --> 00:13:38,880
if you take that step to walk forward to

449
00:13:38,880 --> 00:13:40,000
us um

450
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:41,680
and then on the retention piece it's

451
00:13:41,680 --> 00:13:43,839
identifying what do people internally

452
00:13:43,839 --> 00:13:44,560
actually

453
00:13:44,560 --> 00:13:47,040
need to feel like they matter what are

454
00:13:47,040 --> 00:13:48,959
we giving back and it's things like our

455
00:13:48,959 --> 00:13:51,600
srg's rights our resource groups

456
00:13:51,600 --> 00:13:54,000
um we have plenty of those you know

457
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:56,240
which is around diversity giving back i

458
00:13:56,240 --> 00:13:57,839
know sustainability is another one that

459
00:13:57,839 --> 00:13:59,360
you focus on right

460
00:13:59,360 --> 00:14:01,600
um and it's giving that platform to go

461
00:14:01,600 --> 00:14:03,760
okay here's a resource group for you but

462
00:14:03,760 --> 00:14:05,519
here's an opportunity for you to grow

463
00:14:05,519 --> 00:14:08,079
and to develop internally and in turn

464
00:14:08,079 --> 00:14:09,760
we we offer those opportunities to

465
00:14:09,760 --> 00:14:11,279
retain that talent

466
00:14:11,279 --> 00:14:13,120
that's incredible why do you think uh

467
00:14:13,120 --> 00:14:14,480
taiwa that the recruit

468
00:14:14,480 --> 00:14:15,839
consciousness and the retained

469
00:14:15,839 --> 00:14:17,680
consciousness kind of side by side are

470
00:14:17,680 --> 00:14:19,360
important as you've been here now for

471
00:14:19,360 --> 00:14:22,399
for a good period of time uh why is it

472
00:14:22,399 --> 00:14:24,720
important to care about both there and

473
00:14:24,720 --> 00:14:27,519
your tactics in there no no because the

474
00:14:27,519 --> 00:14:27,920
the

475
00:14:27,920 --> 00:14:30,800
basic mistake that you can make is you

476
00:14:30,800 --> 00:14:31,360
know what

477
00:14:31,360 --> 00:14:33,360
if we get a woman in though if we get as

478
00:14:33,360 --> 00:14:35,199
many women and as many black people and

479
00:14:35,199 --> 00:14:36,800
as you know change up a race and you

480
00:14:36,800 --> 00:14:38,079
know it's all balanced

481
00:14:38,079 --> 00:14:40,320
everyone will be happy right um and

482
00:14:40,320 --> 00:14:42,079
that's it you know we've got a balanced

483
00:14:42,079 --> 00:14:43,360
workforce we've got

484
00:14:43,360 --> 00:14:44,880
diversity we've got inclusion and that's

485
00:14:44,880 --> 00:14:47,040
it that's what we have to do right um

486
00:14:47,040 --> 00:14:49,360
and actually um it goes back to that

487
00:14:49,360 --> 00:14:50,720
thing of representation where are these

488
00:14:50,720 --> 00:14:51,199
people

489
00:14:51,199 --> 00:14:53,600
within the business right what uh

490
00:14:53,600 --> 00:14:55,040
initiatives are you putting in place so

491
00:14:55,040 --> 00:14:56,560
that people feel like

492
00:14:56,560 --> 00:14:59,519
their ethnicity their background their

493
00:14:59,519 --> 00:15:00,639
beliefs

494
00:15:00,639 --> 00:15:03,440
matter at work um and i feel like a lot

495
00:15:03,440 --> 00:15:04,800
you know it's easy to just go into the

496
00:15:04,800 --> 00:15:05,279
recruit

497
00:15:05,279 --> 00:15:07,040
the recruitment part is easy you know we

498
00:15:07,040 --> 00:15:08,880
that's what we do you can put pressure

499
00:15:08,880 --> 00:15:10,320
on us to get as many women for you as

500
00:15:10,320 --> 00:15:11,120
possible

501
00:15:11,120 --> 00:15:13,120
um and you can even just you know bypass

502
00:15:13,120 --> 00:15:15,120
processes and get people in

503
00:15:15,120 --> 00:15:16,320
but it's actually how do you keep those

504
00:15:16,320 --> 00:15:18,000
people so they they don't feel like they

505
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:20,399
were part of like a tick box exercise

506
00:15:20,399 --> 00:15:22,079
um and now that you've got them on board

507
00:15:22,079 --> 00:15:23,360
that's all you know it's hands off and

508
00:15:23,360 --> 00:15:24,639
they just need to find their way

509
00:15:24,639 --> 00:15:28,000
at snake um so i think it's a very key

510
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:29,519
aspect of not just thinking about the

511
00:15:29,519 --> 00:15:31,839
recruitment but the retention piece is

512
00:15:31,839 --> 00:15:34,720
possibly more important um because

513
00:15:34,720 --> 00:15:35,920
people will only be

514
00:15:35,920 --> 00:15:37,199
happy at work when they feel like

515
00:15:37,199 --> 00:15:39,040
actually i can see that someone is

516
00:15:39,040 --> 00:15:40,079
progressing in this

517
00:15:40,079 --> 00:15:42,639
uh particular role um that looks like me

518
00:15:42,639 --> 00:15:43,279
or that

519
00:15:43,279 --> 00:15:45,680
you know is my gender or whatever it is

520
00:15:45,680 --> 00:15:47,600
and so i can aspire to that same level

521
00:15:47,600 --> 00:15:48,160
of like

522
00:15:48,160 --> 00:15:51,279
um uh you know i don't want to use the

523
00:15:51,279 --> 00:15:52,399
word greatness because it sounds so

524
00:15:52,399 --> 00:15:54,560
extreme but just like um i can see that

525
00:15:54,560 --> 00:15:55,440
there's gross

526
00:15:55,440 --> 00:15:57,600
in this company and people are being

527
00:15:57,600 --> 00:15:59,279
rewarded for good work

528
00:15:59,279 --> 00:16:01,279
not just because there's something or

529
00:16:01,279 --> 00:16:02,880
they take a box right

530
00:16:02,880 --> 00:16:04,800
um and there was just a little piece i

531
00:16:04,800 --> 00:16:07,120
was going to add to that as well

532
00:16:07,120 --> 00:16:09,120
heidi was saying is set yourself

533
00:16:09,120 --> 00:16:11,360
achievable targets right don't don't

534
00:16:11,360 --> 00:16:14,320
go in and think you're going to solve

535
00:16:14,320 --> 00:16:15,199
diversity

536
00:16:15,199 --> 00:16:17,120
in one sit one sitting it's not going to

537
00:16:17,120 --> 00:16:18,720
happen it will also show

538
00:16:18,720 --> 00:16:20,160
like that you've not taken in the

539
00:16:20,160 --> 00:16:22,320
education piece properly

540
00:16:22,320 --> 00:16:24,480
i think you've set um achievable targets

541
00:16:24,480 --> 00:16:26,320
um small but you know

542
00:16:26,320 --> 00:16:27,839
some that you can achieve and hit as

543
00:16:27,839 --> 00:16:29,759
soon as possible uh and then also

544
00:16:29,759 --> 00:16:30,800
obviously improve on

545
00:16:30,800 --> 00:16:33,600
um but also uh the ones that you you

546
00:16:33,600 --> 00:16:34,160
won't

547
00:16:34,160 --> 00:16:36,399
find yourself compromising for um right

548
00:16:36,399 --> 00:16:37,199
so you won't just

549
00:16:37,199 --> 00:16:38,800
bring someone in because you're a woman

550
00:16:38,800 --> 00:16:40,720
and bypass a whole process because you

551
00:16:40,720 --> 00:16:41,360
think that's

552
00:16:41,360 --> 00:16:44,320
what you need to do but i think where

553
00:16:44,320 --> 00:16:46,000
heidi and team have been amazing is that

554
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:47,360
unconscious bias training

555
00:16:47,360 --> 00:16:50,639
is constant um and people are having to

556
00:16:50,639 --> 00:16:51,040
sort of

557
00:16:51,040 --> 00:16:53,040
check themselves on if they're doing

558
00:16:53,040 --> 00:16:54,320
things the proper way

559
00:16:54,320 --> 00:16:56,240
or not just to you know just get people

560
00:16:56,240 --> 00:16:58,160
in and really

561
00:16:58,160 --> 00:17:01,040
appreciate that keep going yeah yes just

562
00:17:01,040 --> 00:17:02,480
to add to that because i think

563
00:17:02,480 --> 00:17:04,959
absolutely 100 but we also give that

564
00:17:04,959 --> 00:17:05,919
platform

565
00:17:05,919 --> 00:17:08,880
every single day so um just to call out

566
00:17:08,880 --> 00:17:10,400
some events that we've done over the

567
00:17:10,400 --> 00:17:11,520
last you know because we were just

568
00:17:11,520 --> 00:17:13,119
talking about that sneak for good

569
00:17:13,119 --> 00:17:15,119
and the efforts that we have with the

570
00:17:15,119 --> 00:17:17,199
srg's it's things like we give a

571
00:17:17,199 --> 00:17:18,799
platform to certain members

572
00:17:18,799 --> 00:17:21,520
of of our community which is hey let's

573
00:17:21,520 --> 00:17:23,439
let's have an actual presentation about

574
00:17:23,439 --> 00:17:24,240
eid

575
00:17:24,240 --> 00:17:26,799
let's talk about june teens let's talk

576
00:17:26,799 --> 00:17:28,400
about lgb qt

577
00:17:28,400 --> 00:17:30,400
plus let's talk about you know let's

578
00:17:30,400 --> 00:17:32,320
celebrate internet international women's

579
00:17:32,320 --> 00:17:34,799
day let's celebrate pride month let's do

580
00:17:34,799 --> 00:17:36,480
black lives matter let's be a part of

581
00:17:36,480 --> 00:17:37,840
these but it's the

582
00:17:37,840 --> 00:17:41,280
it's the platform that is given to each

583
00:17:41,280 --> 00:17:43,520
of those celebrations that then

584
00:17:43,520 --> 00:17:46,400
you don't get a chance to let that bias

585
00:17:46,400 --> 00:17:48,320
creep in because every day we're

586
00:17:48,320 --> 00:17:49,679
celebrating

587
00:17:49,679 --> 00:17:51,840
a different part of the community that

588
00:17:51,840 --> 00:17:52,960
makes sneak

589
00:17:52,960 --> 00:17:56,320
and by creating those resources

590
00:17:56,320 --> 00:17:58,240
it's become and i put that down to our

591
00:17:58,240 --> 00:17:59,840
people ops team and you know people like

592
00:17:59,840 --> 00:18:01,600
you bro who are out there every day

593
00:18:01,600 --> 00:18:04,240
thinking what what more can we do um and

594
00:18:04,240 --> 00:18:05,679
it's people putting their hand up and

595
00:18:05,679 --> 00:18:07,200
saying you know like we've now got a big

596
00:18:07,200 --> 00:18:09,360
mama's group which is for people who are

597
00:18:09,360 --> 00:18:10,880
parents women who are

598
00:18:10,880 --> 00:18:13,520
you know birth givers who are either new

599
00:18:13,520 --> 00:18:15,600
moms first-time moms maybe

600
00:18:15,600 --> 00:18:18,240
when truly established parents out there

601
00:18:18,240 --> 00:18:19,760
you know but it's that kind of group

602
00:18:19,760 --> 00:18:21,520
which says hey there's a community here

603
00:18:21,520 --> 00:18:23,120
for you there's a safe place

604
00:18:23,120 --> 00:18:24,720
whoever you are whatever background

605
00:18:24,720 --> 00:18:26,799
whatever interest we've either got a

606
00:18:26,799 --> 00:18:27,760
slack channel

607
00:18:27,760 --> 00:18:31,120
an srg or a celebration day in place

608
00:18:31,120 --> 00:18:33,760
it's that kind of visibility i think and

609
00:18:33,760 --> 00:18:34,799
then i think it

610
00:18:34,799 --> 00:18:36,960
at least my own impression is if if you

611
00:18:36,960 --> 00:18:38,480
enter a place and you see

612
00:18:38,480 --> 00:18:40,000
and you're just well maybe you're just a

613
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:41,039
candidate and you're looking at an

614
00:18:41,039 --> 00:18:42,559
organization but you see people maybe

615
00:18:42,559 --> 00:18:43,919
that resemble your background or your

616
00:18:43,919 --> 00:18:45,360
traditional path or less traditional

617
00:18:45,360 --> 00:18:46,160
path

618
00:18:46,160 --> 00:18:48,320
into that seat you're going to feel that

619
00:18:48,320 --> 00:18:49,840
community you're going to feel that that

620
00:18:49,840 --> 00:18:51,600
that sense of worth

621
00:18:51,600 --> 00:18:52,799
and you're going to get feedback from

622
00:18:52,799 --> 00:18:54,720
somebody that's instantly credible but

623
00:18:54,720 --> 00:18:57,039
because perhaps they have a similar uh

624
00:18:57,039 --> 00:18:58,320
approach to life that you have and i

625
00:18:58,320 --> 00:18:59,520
think that's why these

626
00:18:59,520 --> 00:19:01,120
these programs once they've started if

627
00:19:01,120 --> 00:19:03,120
they're rooted in that authentic desire

628
00:19:03,120 --> 00:19:04,799
to diversify and create that

629
00:19:04,799 --> 00:19:07,840
community that family then it does start

630
00:19:07,840 --> 00:19:09,120
to to feed on itself

631
00:19:09,120 --> 00:19:12,400
and and the retained feeling of of high

632
00:19:12,400 --> 00:19:14,000
belonging makes the candidate

633
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:16,160
experience or the candid interaction

634
00:19:16,160 --> 00:19:17,520
more fulfilling

635
00:19:17,520 --> 00:19:19,200
uh and maybe maybe turns up that

636
00:19:19,200 --> 00:19:20,880
magnetism but then when somebody comes

637
00:19:20,880 --> 00:19:22,240
in the door they feel at home they do

638
00:19:22,240 --> 00:19:23,600
their best work then of course they're

639
00:19:23,600 --> 00:19:24,400
growing

640
00:19:24,400 --> 00:19:27,120
uh to taiwan's point of evolving getting

641
00:19:27,120 --> 00:19:28,000
promoted

642
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:30,080
you know uh getting rewarded uh and

643
00:19:30,080 --> 00:19:31,360
getting more responsibility and an

644
00:19:31,360 --> 00:19:32,320
ability to

645
00:19:32,320 --> 00:19:34,480
to share your truth in in the

646
00:19:34,480 --> 00:19:35,600
environment that you're in

647
00:19:35,600 --> 00:19:38,799
and grow in that i just wanted to

648
00:19:38,799 --> 00:19:40,559
to to point out quickly before i go to

649
00:19:40,559 --> 00:19:42,640
the last question the code of conduct

650
00:19:42,640 --> 00:19:43,280
per se

651
00:19:43,280 --> 00:19:45,760
for recruiters that that that daily

652
00:19:45,760 --> 00:19:47,200
re-upping that promise

653
00:19:47,200 --> 00:19:48,640
i think is an interesting thing for

654
00:19:48,640 --> 00:19:50,240
companies to consider here

655
00:19:50,240 --> 00:19:52,000
and certainly a formal bias training

656
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:53,520
that's tailored to your language and

657
00:19:53,520 --> 00:19:54,880
your organization is

658
00:19:54,880 --> 00:19:57,200
is important and a drum beat to to

659
00:19:57,200 --> 00:19:58,000
continue to

660
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:01,039
to to hear in companies um

661
00:20:01,039 --> 00:20:02,559
and then it's just that that helping

662
00:20:02,559 --> 00:20:04,000
people feel like they matter i was just

663
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:04,480
going to

664
00:20:04,480 --> 00:20:06,240
make certain that that was very very

665
00:20:06,240 --> 00:20:07,360
clear and that can be done through

666
00:20:07,360 --> 00:20:09,120
programming it can be done through

667
00:20:09,120 --> 00:20:10,960
the intangible pieces just the behaviors

668
00:20:10,960 --> 00:20:12,320
that people exhibit and

669
00:20:12,320 --> 00:20:14,720
and creating a caring culture as the

670
00:20:14,720 --> 00:20:17,039
value of of here at sneak care deeply

671
00:20:17,039 --> 00:20:19,360
kind of reigns supreme in the in the in

672
00:20:19,360 --> 00:20:20,720
the in the cultural

673
00:20:20,720 --> 00:20:23,600
uh context um i did appreciate that that

674
00:20:23,600 --> 00:20:25,679
achievable targets does anybody want to

675
00:20:25,679 --> 00:20:27,520
to sound off at all on measurement i

676
00:20:27,520 --> 00:20:28,960
know that's really important for people

677
00:20:28,960 --> 00:20:30,240
to be more and more public about their

678
00:20:30,240 --> 00:20:32,159
measurement but even internally

679
00:20:32,159 --> 00:20:34,159
um you know setting goals in certain

680
00:20:34,159 --> 00:20:36,640
areas at the right level and being

681
00:20:36,640 --> 00:20:38,640
making those goals visible for people

682
00:20:38,640 --> 00:20:40,000
did we want to touch on measurement for

683
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:41,600
a few minutes or did people just want to

684
00:20:41,600 --> 00:20:44,000
want to wrap up with with other other

685
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:45,360
ideas or thoughts that they would want

686
00:20:45,360 --> 00:20:46,880
to want to share with with other

687
00:20:46,880 --> 00:20:48,320
companies trying to be more

688
00:20:48,320 --> 00:20:51,200
diverse uh and more inclusive so either

689
00:20:51,200 --> 00:20:52,400
measurement or just a wrap

690
00:20:52,400 --> 00:20:55,840
up a wrap-up thought either and then uh

691
00:20:55,840 --> 00:20:57,760
you know do a wrap-up with anything

692
00:20:57,760 --> 00:20:59,600
um i think with measurement like as i

693
00:20:59,600 --> 00:21:02,960
said just is setting

694
00:21:02,960 --> 00:21:05,039
it's first of all stepping back and just

695
00:21:05,039 --> 00:21:06,080
looking okay where

696
00:21:06,080 --> 00:21:08,320
do we lack diversity the most in our

697
00:21:08,320 --> 00:21:09,760
business right so we have several

698
00:21:09,760 --> 00:21:11,120
departments you can call it r

699
00:21:11,120 --> 00:21:13,760
d call it engineering but it's actually

700
00:21:13,760 --> 00:21:15,760
understanding where do we find that

701
00:21:15,760 --> 00:21:16,720
actually

702
00:21:16,720 --> 00:21:19,520
we just have you know one type of person

703
00:21:19,520 --> 00:21:20,320
in the business

704
00:21:20,320 --> 00:21:23,520
right um and then setting

705
00:21:23,520 --> 00:21:25,520
a goal against that right because it's

706
00:21:25,520 --> 00:21:27,200
easy to say oh no you should have

707
00:21:27,200 --> 00:21:29,520
a 35 goal by the end of the year or

708
00:21:29,520 --> 00:21:30,240
something

709
00:21:30,240 --> 00:21:31,919
but actually where does that go into if

710
00:21:31,919 --> 00:21:33,440
it all goes into people ups

711
00:21:33,440 --> 00:21:35,679
it doesn't mean you've diversified the

712
00:21:35,679 --> 00:21:37,600
workforce it means you just brought in

713
00:21:37,600 --> 00:21:39,760
more people into people-ups that help

714
00:21:39,760 --> 00:21:41,679
your diversity numbers yes

715
00:21:41,679 --> 00:21:44,240
um and so it's it's i think it's just

716
00:21:44,240 --> 00:21:46,159
that piece where it's like look into

717
00:21:46,159 --> 00:21:48,480
every department you have typically

718
00:21:48,480 --> 00:21:49,280
historically

719
00:21:49,280 --> 00:21:51,919
most like women for example are in

720
00:21:51,919 --> 00:21:54,080
people-looks or recruitment or something

721
00:21:54,080 --> 00:21:55,120
of that nature

722
00:21:55,120 --> 00:21:57,360
um and so for you to say you know i want

723
00:21:57,360 --> 00:21:58,880
more women in recruitment would just

724
00:21:58,880 --> 00:21:59,840
sound crazy

725
00:21:59,840 --> 00:22:02,159
right um so you want to go into the

726
00:22:02,159 --> 00:22:03,440
harder areas where it's like

727
00:22:03,440 --> 00:22:05,760
in fact we might not find a woman in

728
00:22:05,760 --> 00:22:06,799
this area

729
00:22:06,799 --> 00:22:08,799
right but how do we open up doors so

730
00:22:08,799 --> 00:22:10,480
that we actually get women into those

731
00:22:10,480 --> 00:22:11,280
areas

732
00:22:11,280 --> 00:22:13,440
is where you set your your your your

733
00:22:13,440 --> 00:22:15,200
sort of numbers and your targets

734
00:22:15,200 --> 00:22:16,880
um and so i don't think it's easy to

735
00:22:16,880 --> 00:22:18,559
quantify it generally

736
00:22:18,559 --> 00:22:19,919
um because i think you have to take that

737
00:22:19,919 --> 00:22:21,600
holistic approach to your business

738
00:22:21,600 --> 00:22:23,760
before you do that amazing any other

739
00:22:23,760 --> 00:22:24,880
thought on measurement

740
00:22:24,880 --> 00:22:27,440
heidi before before we go back and round

741
00:22:27,440 --> 00:22:29,039
the horn on wrap up

742
00:22:29,039 --> 00:22:30,720
absolutely i think another one that you

743
00:22:30,720 --> 00:22:32,480
should measure is what efforts or what

744
00:22:32,480 --> 00:22:35,200
conversations are you having out there

745
00:22:35,200 --> 00:22:37,280
externally right now versus which ones

746
00:22:37,280 --> 00:22:38,240
you could be we

747
00:22:38,240 --> 00:22:41,440
we focus very much on byp which is

748
00:22:41,440 --> 00:22:43,600
um black young professionals we focus

749
00:22:43,600 --> 00:22:45,440
very much in sisters in cells which is

750
00:22:45,440 --> 00:22:47,280
focusing on black females within the

751
00:22:47,280 --> 00:22:48,000
cells

752
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:51,039
um industry it's what conversations are

753
00:22:51,039 --> 00:22:52,400
you actually having right now

754
00:22:52,400 --> 00:22:54,720
externally with people who might come

755
00:22:54,720 --> 00:22:56,559
from underrepresented talent right so

756
00:22:56,559 --> 00:22:57,360
it's one thing to look at the

757
00:22:57,360 --> 00:22:58,480
opportunities okay

758
00:22:58,480 --> 00:23:00,720
we've got very few females in sales

759
00:23:00,720 --> 00:23:02,400
let's go and attract them okay but what

760
00:23:02,400 --> 00:23:03,240
about the

761
00:23:03,240 --> 00:23:05,840
under-represented talent which can fill

762
00:23:05,840 --> 00:23:08,240
entry-level roles and plug that gap

763
00:23:08,240 --> 00:23:11,039
right what can we do to actually assist

764
00:23:11,039 --> 00:23:12,320
better from a

765
00:23:12,320 --> 00:23:14,720
um ethical perspective really when you

766
00:23:14,720 --> 00:23:16,159
look at the roots of it what

767
00:23:16,159 --> 00:23:18,480
opportunities are you able to offer

768
00:23:18,480 --> 00:23:19,679
and which ones are you not taking

769
00:23:19,679 --> 00:23:21,440
advantage of that you could you could be

770
00:23:21,440 --> 00:23:22,640
better as a company

771
00:23:22,640 --> 00:23:24,320
so it's looking at those conversations

772
00:23:24,320 --> 00:23:26,080
if we're having no conversations right

773
00:23:26,080 --> 00:23:27,360
now with people from

774
00:23:27,360 --> 00:23:29,360
i don't know a female dominated

775
00:23:29,360 --> 00:23:31,280
background or a male dominated if you're

776
00:23:31,280 --> 00:23:33,760
a very female orientated company or

777
00:23:33,760 --> 00:23:36,080
for people from different ethnicities

778
00:23:36,080 --> 00:23:37,360
start measuring actually how many

779
00:23:37,360 --> 00:23:38,880
conversations you start to have

780
00:23:38,880 --> 00:23:40,400
because that can help to snowball as

781
00:23:40,400 --> 00:23:42,880
well so it's looking at the general plus

782
00:23:42,880 --> 00:23:44,400
the department level

783
00:23:44,400 --> 00:23:47,760
actual gender actual racial makeup of a

784
00:23:47,760 --> 00:23:49,039
team

785
00:23:49,039 --> 00:23:50,559
but then it's also it's also

786
00:23:50,559 --> 00:23:52,400
understanding that measurement not only

787
00:23:52,400 --> 00:23:54,320
can be against those demographic data

788
00:23:54,320 --> 00:23:56,480
points but also the actions being taken

789
00:23:56,480 --> 00:23:58,240
to further diversify if you decided

790
00:23:58,240 --> 00:24:00,159
that's your goal having discussions in

791
00:24:00,159 --> 00:24:01,760
the right places and measuring that and

792
00:24:01,760 --> 00:24:03,200
incenting people to move toward those

793
00:24:03,200 --> 00:24:04,000
behaviors will

794
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:06,480
in fact likely bear more fruit than if

795
00:24:06,480 --> 00:24:07,679
you're saying something and doing no

796
00:24:07,679 --> 00:24:08,960
actions and having no measurement

797
00:24:08,960 --> 00:24:09,440
against

798
00:24:09,440 --> 00:24:11,200
the behaviors or the actions being taken

799
00:24:11,200 --> 00:24:13,440
to to truly materialize the goal

800
00:24:13,440 --> 00:24:16,080
so that seems really logical to me any

801
00:24:16,080 --> 00:24:17,200
any thoughts

802
00:24:17,200 --> 00:24:19,360
taiwo as we as we kind of go out knowing

803
00:24:19,360 --> 00:24:20,720
that that other companies that are

804
00:24:20,720 --> 00:24:21,919
trying to

805
00:24:21,919 --> 00:24:23,919
to to be where we are or catch up or

806
00:24:23,919 --> 00:24:25,760
perhaps even inspire us but needed one

807
00:24:25,760 --> 00:24:26,320
more

808
00:24:26,320 --> 00:24:27,840
one more nugget one more piece of

809
00:24:27,840 --> 00:24:29,360
inspiration to go out and do this

810
00:24:29,360 --> 00:24:30,799
this important work as we're building

811
00:24:30,799 --> 00:24:33,279
our teams now i'll just say honestly um

812
00:24:33,279 --> 00:24:34,559
don't be too hard on yourselves it's a

813
00:24:34,559 --> 00:24:35,840
very difficult market

814
00:24:35,840 --> 00:24:38,880
we are all learning from it um and so

815
00:24:38,880 --> 00:24:40,960
you know it's it's just understand your

816
00:24:40,960 --> 00:24:42,720
business needs uh run at

817
00:24:42,720 --> 00:24:44,480
the pace that your business needs it to

818
00:24:44,480 --> 00:24:47,279
run um and then just uh you know

819
00:24:47,279 --> 00:24:50,480
be be be intentional about

820
00:24:50,480 --> 00:24:52,159
you know diversity don't do it because

821
00:24:52,159 --> 00:24:54,159
everyone else is doing it or because

822
00:24:54,159 --> 00:24:56,000
you think it's the right hopefully you

823
00:24:56,000 --> 00:24:57,200
think it's the right thing to do but you

824
00:24:57,200 --> 00:24:57,919
just think oh

825
00:24:57,919 --> 00:24:59,600
i should be taking this box yeah because

826
00:24:59,600 --> 00:25:01,120
then it will quickly show if you're

827
00:25:01,120 --> 00:25:02,000
intentional about

828
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:05,120
um about diversity and inclusion

829
00:25:05,120 --> 00:25:06,400
it will show in the way your business

830
00:25:06,400 --> 00:25:07,919
operates it will show in the things that

831
00:25:07,919 --> 00:25:08,640
you

832
00:25:08,640 --> 00:25:11,520
encourage in your business um and um

833
00:25:11,520 --> 00:25:13,039
like i said earlier recruitment is the

834
00:25:13,039 --> 00:25:14,559
easy part um

835
00:25:14,559 --> 00:25:16,159
you know you can go out and get people

836
00:25:16,159 --> 00:25:18,240
it's how do you make sure that actually

837
00:25:18,240 --> 00:25:19,520
the things you're selling these people

838
00:25:19,520 --> 00:25:21,679
to bring them in are sort of

839
00:25:21,679 --> 00:25:24,240
evidenced in in their day-to-day whilst

840
00:25:24,240 --> 00:25:25,279
they're working

841
00:25:25,279 --> 00:25:27,039
i'll keep it short and sweet oh i

842
00:25:27,039 --> 00:25:28,720
appreciate that greatly that that was a

843
00:25:28,720 --> 00:25:30,720
tremendous wrap up that was really solid

844
00:25:30,720 --> 00:25:33,679
heidi heidi over to you

845
00:25:33,679 --> 00:25:35,760
oh no mine's exactly the same as taiway

846
00:25:35,760 --> 00:25:37,360
right but all i'd say is

847
00:25:37,360 --> 00:25:39,360
the only way that i think i have a

848
00:25:39,360 --> 00:25:41,200
better understanding of dni is through

849
00:25:41,200 --> 00:25:42,640
education i've been

850
00:25:42,640 --> 00:25:44,080
brave enough to ask the awkward

851
00:25:44,080 --> 00:25:45,840
questions you know why aren't we

852
00:25:45,840 --> 00:25:47,520
attracting people from a diverse

853
00:25:47,520 --> 00:25:48,159
background

854
00:25:48,159 --> 00:25:49,520
why would i want to work here as a

855
00:25:49,520 --> 00:25:51,440
female why wouldn't i want to

856
00:25:51,440 --> 00:25:53,200
the same with taiwa i'm sure as a black

857
00:25:53,200 --> 00:25:54,640
person why would i want to work here why

858
00:25:54,640 --> 00:25:56,159
wouldn't i want to it's kind of like

859
00:25:56,159 --> 00:25:57,760
having uncomfortable conversations and

860
00:25:57,760 --> 00:25:59,279
educating yourself

861
00:25:59,279 --> 00:26:00,799
around that and being willing to look at

862
00:26:00,799 --> 00:26:02,320
yourself and be like i'm probably not

863
00:26:02,320 --> 00:26:03,679
doing my best here

864
00:26:03,679 --> 00:26:06,080
and just take those baby steps um like

865
00:26:06,080 --> 00:26:08,000
taiwa said don't be too hard on yourself

866
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:08,400
right

867
00:26:08,400 --> 00:26:10,720

868
00:26:10,720 --> 00:26:12,080
diverse talent

869
00:26:12,080 --> 00:26:14,400

870
00:26:14,400 --> 00:26:15,279

876
00:26:23,840 --> 00:26:24,799
lot of authentic

877
00:26:24,799 --> 00:26:27,279
effort uh and then certainly even even

878
00:26:27,279 --> 00:26:28,799
the calendaring and even the incentives

879
00:26:28,799 --> 00:26:30,799
and even the celebrations and the

880
00:26:30,799 --> 00:26:33,360
uh the the things that that i feel like

881
00:26:33,360 --> 00:26:34,159

certain group lasts throughout the year

888
