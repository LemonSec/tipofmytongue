1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,419
so thank you hey I will be talking about

2
00:00:03,419 --> 00:00:05,339
Porter cross etiquette or how you can

3
00:00:05,339 --> 00:00:07,649
remain polite way doing code review

4
00:00:07,649 --> 00:00:10,320
my name is Eric I'm a coder and I work

5
00:00:10,320 --> 00:00:13,320
at an awesome company called salt oh hey

6
00:00:13,320 --> 00:00:15,080
I'm gonna talk about like github

7
00:00:15,080 --> 00:00:17,910
terminology using PR and pull requests a

8
00:00:17,910 --> 00:00:20,730
lot but basically if you work a good lab

9
00:00:20,730 --> 00:00:22,859
or any other technology like mojo quest

10
00:00:22,859 --> 00:00:26,640
coda true it's all the same so some a

11
00:00:26,640 --> 00:00:28,680
prerequisite and all the or repositories

12
00:00:28,680 --> 00:00:30,750
within your organization were open

13
00:00:30,750 --> 00:00:32,549
source product should demand code review

14
00:00:32,549 --> 00:00:34,860
before merging into your main branch the

15
00:00:34,860 --> 00:00:37,710
same goes for CIA checks no code that is

16
00:00:37,710 --> 00:00:41,399
not tested should not be merged hey well

17
00:00:41,399 --> 00:00:42,629
it's not mandatory

18
00:00:42,629 --> 00:00:44,460
I do recommend working with git rebase

19
00:00:44,460 --> 00:00:46,469
it will really clean your login your

20
00:00:46,469 --> 00:00:48,930
main branch making it simple to review

21
00:00:48,930 --> 00:00:51,149
and it will actually optimize your CI

22
00:00:51,149 --> 00:00:53,070
builds as well since it's the same

23
00:00:53,070 --> 00:00:54,930
Committee are traveling from there were

24
00:00:54,930 --> 00:00:57,899
future branches into your main branch so

25
00:00:57,899 --> 00:00:59,789
why do we do these four requests of code

26
00:00:59,789 --> 00:01:02,190
reviews they help us focus the committer

27
00:01:02,190 --> 00:01:03,510
because when you're trying to explain

28
00:01:03,510 --> 00:01:05,010
something you actually think about it

29
00:01:05,010 --> 00:01:07,290
differently it's also for learning but

30
00:01:07,290 --> 00:01:09,330
for the reviewer as well it's to

31
00:01:09,330 --> 00:01:11,159
evaluate the code standards that we want

32
00:01:11,159 --> 00:01:13,260
to set and to ensure that the change is

33
00:01:13,260 --> 00:01:16,259
even relevant or needed pluralist

34
00:01:16,259 --> 00:01:18,750
however are not passing responsibility

35
00:01:18,750 --> 00:01:22,110
or accountability as a review ee i can

36
00:01:22,110 --> 00:01:24,240
open the purpose whenever i want but I

37
00:01:24,240 --> 00:01:25,939
don't want to waste time of people

38
00:01:25,939 --> 00:01:28,049
reviewing things that I'm ready to

39
00:01:28,049 --> 00:01:30,720
review yet so what I recommend to do is

40
00:01:30,720 --> 00:01:33,960
open that progress as a draft and to

41
00:01:33,960 --> 00:01:36,150
prefix the title of it with working

42
00:01:36,150 --> 00:01:38,340
progress you should probably still film

43
00:01:38,340 --> 00:01:40,439
the body though a this is a great place

44
00:01:40,439 --> 00:01:42,119
for a checklist so kind of the design

45
00:01:42,119 --> 00:01:43,979
intent of whatever change you're going

46
00:01:43,979 --> 00:01:46,500
to do as you're working these are your

47
00:01:46,500 --> 00:01:48,240
new best friends git rebase interactive

48
00:01:48,240 --> 00:01:50,360
you'll do this all the time

49
00:01:50,360 --> 00:01:53,040
squashing moving around code fetching

50
00:01:53,040 --> 00:01:55,079
things from out stringing etc another

51
00:01:55,079 --> 00:01:58,320
thing is get push force with Lee's if

52
00:01:58,320 --> 00:02:00,090
you're collaborating on a branch and you

53
00:02:00,090 --> 00:02:01,649
don't want to overwrite things with good

54
00:02:01,649 --> 00:02:04,229
force it push force force release

55
00:02:04,229 --> 00:02:06,180
actually prevents that if the last

56
00:02:06,180 --> 00:02:08,740
commit is not yours and the origin

57
00:02:08,740 --> 00:02:11,170
a your features ready you've been coding

58
00:02:11,170 --> 00:02:13,000
everything is also me preparing for the

59
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:15,310
review the most important thing is

60
00:02:15,310 --> 00:02:17,080
actually the gate lock it should be a

61
00:02:17,080 --> 00:02:19,570
poetic story a shareable tale of your

62
00:02:19,570 --> 00:02:22,300
change each gate commits should be a

63
00:02:22,300 --> 00:02:24,790
logical change that means that you

64
00:02:24,790 --> 00:02:26,950
should not have those old typos or

65
00:02:26,950 --> 00:02:30,010
working for realz etc yes those are real

66
00:02:30,010 --> 00:02:33,330
commits and they should all be squashed

67
00:02:33,330 --> 00:02:36,220
the gift commits format is as Lewis

68
00:02:36,220 --> 00:02:39,070
taught us a short fifty characters or

69
00:02:39,070 --> 00:02:41,350
less summary for all those a lovely one

70
00:02:41,350 --> 00:02:43,570
minor get logs if you wanna elaborate

71
00:02:43,570 --> 00:02:45,120
more you can do that in the gate body

72
00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:47,890
you can add metadata like ticketing

73
00:02:47,890 --> 00:02:50,620
injera whatever you want a do yourself a

74
00:02:50,620 --> 00:02:53,200
favor be professional and set a spell

75
00:02:53,200 --> 00:02:56,020
check because that actually matters in

76
00:02:56,020 --> 00:02:57,690
the end when the pull request is ready

77
00:02:57,690 --> 00:03:00,040
you will want to remove the working

78
00:03:00,040 --> 00:03:01,840
programs as a prefix for the title

79
00:03:01,840 --> 00:03:04,060
removing from the draft status and most

80
00:03:04,060 --> 00:03:06,570
importantly have the body kind of

81
00:03:06,570 --> 00:03:09,310
explain the general gist of the change

82
00:03:09,310 --> 00:03:12,340
yes that's upon the checklist that

83
00:03:12,340 --> 00:03:13,600
you're going through before doing this

84
00:03:13,600 --> 00:03:16,360
is all a new code is tested and tests

85
00:03:16,360 --> 00:03:19,300
are passing the CI a the length is as

86
00:03:19,300 --> 00:03:21,370
well and the purpose is not too huge

87
00:03:21,370 --> 00:03:23,820
because that's a real Peter to review a

88
00:03:23,820 --> 00:03:26,620
so anybody could review this right but

89
00:03:26,620 --> 00:03:28,300
you should probably have some people

90
00:03:28,300 --> 00:03:30,310
that actually knows what this code is

91
00:03:30,310 --> 00:03:32,320
about you should include managers

92
00:03:32,320 --> 00:03:34,360
because it helps them not only to be in

93
00:03:34,360 --> 00:03:36,490
touch with code but also with people and

94
00:03:36,490 --> 00:03:38,440
someone from another team when the first

95
00:03:38,440 --> 00:03:40,510
set of eyes and juniors you will learn a

96
00:03:40,510 --> 00:03:42,310
lot from the questions that general they

97
00:03:42,310 --> 00:03:44,800
ask after receiving comments on your

98
00:03:44,800 --> 00:03:46,270
poor request don't try to solve

99
00:03:46,270 --> 00:03:47,320
everything at once

100
00:03:47,320 --> 00:03:49,630
they fix things in separate commands

101
00:03:49,630 --> 00:03:52,420
prefix them would PR fix and be

102
00:03:52,420 --> 00:03:54,220
responsible to notify people that ask

103
00:03:54,220 --> 00:03:56,080
for changes that you've pushed in and

104
00:03:56,080 --> 00:03:59,410
don't guard your code with your ego that

105
00:03:59,410 --> 00:04:01,840
is extremely important as a reviewer

106
00:04:01,840 --> 00:04:04,030
you're not responsible for running or

107
00:04:04,030 --> 00:04:05,950
testing in the code you are responsible

108
00:04:05,950 --> 00:04:07,660
to guard your gate lock that's it

109
00:04:07,660 --> 00:04:10,270
incredibly important as well the review

110
00:04:10,270 --> 00:04:12,250
process starts good by reading the title

111
00:04:12,250 --> 00:04:13,660
and the body of the core request

112
00:04:13,660 --> 00:04:15,460
ensuring that the gate commits are

113
00:04:15,460 --> 00:04:17,380
saying and that the CI a checks are

114
00:04:17,380 --> 00:04:20,140
passing you should never start reading

115
00:04:20,140 --> 00:04:22,000
any code before this is done that's a

116
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:22,620
waste

117
00:04:22,620 --> 00:04:25,620
as you're reviewing the code review it

118
00:04:25,620 --> 00:04:27,570
get make a commitment commit to actually

119
00:04:27,570 --> 00:04:30,000
get the story of the proquest and that's

120
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:31,200
really easy get up you can actually

121
00:04:31,200 --> 00:04:33,810
press em to go to the next commit and

122
00:04:33,810 --> 00:04:35,730
when you do common student in line in

123
00:04:35,730 --> 00:04:37,410
the diffuse so they will be resolved

124
00:04:37,410 --> 00:04:39,630
automatically when that code is actually

125
00:04:39,630 --> 00:04:42,210
changed you can comment on whatever you

126
00:04:42,210 --> 00:04:44,460
want right but do yourself a favor and

127
00:04:44,460 --> 00:04:46,470
actually comment on the critical

128
00:04:46,470 --> 00:04:48,990
business logic as well if you have

129
00:04:48,990 --> 00:04:51,120
feedback use emojis they really sweet

130
00:04:51,120 --> 00:04:52,919
and feedback even if the feedback is

131
00:04:52,919 --> 00:04:55,470
crappy never screaming caps unless it's

132
00:04:55,470 --> 00:04:59,040
upon and be polite in the end you can

133
00:04:59,040 --> 00:05:01,620
either approve lock or comment comma is

134
00:05:01,620 --> 00:05:04,080
like man it's not really taking a stand

135
00:05:04,080 --> 00:05:05,970
if you're the main reviewer common

136
00:05:05,970 --> 00:05:08,220
things not enough you should block if

137
00:05:08,220 --> 00:05:11,190
anything is really worth talking just be

138
00:05:11,190 --> 00:05:13,020
clear why you're doing it and don't be a

139
00:05:13,020 --> 00:05:15,840
douche about how you're writing finally

140
00:05:15,840 --> 00:05:17,610
you'll get to set that okay this

141
00:05:17,610 --> 00:05:19,350
fulfills whatever standard you would set

142
00:05:19,350 --> 00:05:20,910
for yourself you're approving and don't

143
00:05:20,910 --> 00:05:23,130
forget the most important thing never

144
00:05:23,130 --> 00:05:25,740
ever approve a pull request without an

145
00:05:25,740 --> 00:05:27,750
appropriate gift is to mark down code

146
00:05:27,750 --> 00:05:29,880
code of how to add that to your approved

147
00:05:29,880 --> 00:05:33,510
comment Geetha so a as a review II I had

148
00:05:33,510 --> 00:05:35,040
my ProQuest and I got that seal of

149
00:05:35,040 --> 00:05:40,020
approval yes that's another dad on a you

150
00:05:40,020 --> 00:05:42,419
clean up those a dangling PR for fix

151
00:05:42,419 --> 00:05:44,370
commits and you squash though each of

152
00:05:44,370 --> 00:05:46,560
them into the relevant change or commit

153
00:05:46,560 --> 00:05:49,320
that is relevant to your fence formation

154
00:05:49,320 --> 00:05:51,090
bursts fall a style you wait for the CI

155
00:05:51,090 --> 00:05:52,530
because you probably shouldn't be able

156
00:05:52,530 --> 00:05:55,140
to merge without that and you merge away

157
00:05:55,140 --> 00:05:57,750
oh this it's extremely close to the

158
00:05:57,750 --> 00:05:59,340
weekend and you don't really want to

159
00:05:59,340 --> 00:06:01,350
wake up anybody would pager daddy then

160
00:06:01,350 --> 00:06:03,900
don't do and that's it I've been Eric

161
00:06:03,900 --> 00:06:05,729
and I hope you will be very polite

162
00:06:05,729 --> 00:06:09,020
within your code reviews from now
