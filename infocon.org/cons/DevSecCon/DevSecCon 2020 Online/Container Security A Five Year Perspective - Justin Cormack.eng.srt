1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:02,879
well some over to you Justin excellent

2
00:00:02,879 --> 00:00:06,480
well yeah good to be here um thanks for

3
00:00:06,480 --> 00:00:09,540
the intro well yeah so five years young

4
00:00:09,540 --> 00:00:10,980
and took about five year perspective

5
00:00:10,980 --> 00:00:14,219
this is kind of weird kind of thing

6
00:00:14,219 --> 00:00:16,440
in container security because it feels

7
00:00:16,440 --> 00:00:20,850
like an awful long time I'm give you a

8
00:00:20,850 --> 00:00:22,020
bit of an intro to me if you don't know

9
00:00:22,020 --> 00:00:24,210
me I'm an engineer at docker I'm in the

10
00:00:24,210 --> 00:00:26,910
Cambridge UK office insofar as anyone

11
00:00:26,910 --> 00:00:29,400
has any offices anymore I'm also on the

12
00:00:29,400 --> 00:00:32,488
CNCs technical oversight committee I

13
00:00:32,488 --> 00:00:35,430
work for docker and Dockers a company

14
00:00:35,430 --> 00:00:38,790
that loves developers we we've we kind

15
00:00:38,790 --> 00:00:41,910
of split away from the the bit that we

16
00:00:41,910 --> 00:00:43,079
sell Toomer enters the enterprise

17
00:00:43,079 --> 00:00:44,579
product and we're already developing

18
00:00:44,579 --> 00:00:48,090
developer products now I've worked on

19
00:00:48,090 --> 00:00:50,579
security open source I work on

20
00:00:50,579 --> 00:00:53,820
partnerships and collaborations and I

21
00:00:53,820 --> 00:00:55,230
work really across the whole of the

22
00:00:55,230 --> 00:00:57,090
whole of everything we do at Delco which

23
00:00:57,090 --> 00:01:00,600
is good fun I'm Justin Cormac on on all

24
00:01:00,600 --> 00:01:03,930
the social medias and everything this is

25
00:01:03,930 --> 00:01:05,400
Cambridge if you don't know Cambridge if

26
00:01:05,400 --> 00:01:07,860
you follow me on Twitter I usually I

27
00:01:07,860 --> 00:01:09,450
wandered around this part of Cambridge a

28
00:01:09,450 --> 00:01:11,369
bit this is I like Cambridge because

29
00:01:11,369 --> 00:01:13,909
it's a sort of tech village this is um

30
00:01:13,909 --> 00:01:16,140
radio telescopes we have just done

31
00:01:16,140 --> 00:01:18,689
around the corner it's a sort of simple

32
00:01:18,689 --> 00:01:21,570
you know it's a tiny little place but we

33
00:01:21,570 --> 00:01:25,229
do a lot of tech here five years five

34
00:01:25,229 --> 00:01:26,970
years five years whenever so five years

35
00:01:26,970 --> 00:01:29,460
I always remember the Bowie song but

36
00:01:29,460 --> 00:01:31,860
it's weird because five years ago I was

37
00:01:31,860 --> 00:01:33,840
living on in on the rainy streets of

38
00:01:33,840 --> 00:01:36,900
London and I started getting involved in

39
00:01:36,900 --> 00:01:39,570
container security actually worked on a

40
00:01:39,570 --> 00:01:43,200
chapter of a book on docker security

41
00:01:43,200 --> 00:01:48,299
back there and and by some kind of

42
00:01:48,299 --> 00:01:51,869
interesting path I actually ended up but

43
00:01:51,869 --> 00:01:53,250
shortly after that as she working at

44
00:01:53,250 --> 00:01:55,590
dock where I've been since then and and

45
00:01:55,590 --> 00:01:57,270
I've been working on security kind of

46
00:01:57,270 --> 00:01:59,729
all through that time and it's a lot

47
00:01:59,729 --> 00:02:03,390
happens in five years and kind of a lot

48
00:02:03,390 --> 00:02:05,549
stays the same and you know sometimes it

49
00:02:05,549 --> 00:02:06,780
feels a long time sometimes it has a

50
00:02:06,780 --> 00:02:08,729
short time sometimes it feels we've

51
00:02:08,729 --> 00:02:10,919
achieved loads and sometimes it feels

52
00:02:10,919 --> 00:02:13,740
like we've hardly got anywhere

53
00:02:13,740 --> 00:02:18,590
reflects on these things in this talk my

54
00:02:18,590 --> 00:02:22,020
you know particularly you know things

55
00:02:22,020 --> 00:02:24,060
change and things i instr danger I put a

56
00:02:24,060 --> 00:02:25,410
few French quotes in here because I work

57
00:02:25,410 --> 00:02:27,590
with all the French people at darker so

58
00:02:27,590 --> 00:02:30,150
doc has always been a very half French

59
00:02:30,150 --> 00:02:34,230
company the most asked question about

60
00:02:34,230 --> 00:02:37,080
Container security in the whole of five

61
00:02:37,080 --> 00:02:38,880
years I mean I did the Google search

62
00:02:38,880 --> 00:02:41,010
when I was doing this slides a new type

63
00:02:41,010 --> 00:02:43,230
containers versus and virtual machines

64
00:02:43,230 --> 00:02:46,140
is the top of there there's some other

65
00:02:46,140 --> 00:02:48,870
things but it's like um but there's this

66
00:02:48,870 --> 00:02:50,280
kind of weird thing that we've become

67
00:02:50,280 --> 00:02:54,750
very very confrontational and how we

68
00:02:54,750 --> 00:02:57,780
talk about things and software which is

69
00:02:57,780 --> 00:03:00,590
kind of really bad and it's like it's I

70
00:03:00,590 --> 00:03:03,120
don't know there we've seen the rise of

71
00:03:03,120 --> 00:03:04,650
confrontational politics and things in

72
00:03:04,650 --> 00:03:08,160
the last five years as well as its stop

73
00:03:08,160 --> 00:03:10,290
doing that with software you know

74
00:03:10,290 --> 00:03:12,390
there's value in all these things but

75
00:03:12,390 --> 00:03:14,160
this question is actually interesting

76
00:03:14,160 --> 00:03:18,720
because it's it's been like V number one

77
00:03:18,720 --> 00:03:20,370
question throughout this period it's

78
00:03:20,370 --> 00:03:21,450
something that right at the beginning

79
00:03:21,450 --> 00:03:23,190
everyone was totally obsessed with

80
00:03:23,190 --> 00:03:25,290
because virtual machines were really the

81
00:03:25,290 --> 00:03:27,930
point of comparison with containers what

82
00:03:27,930 --> 00:03:29,700
is a container it's like a virtual

83
00:03:29,700 --> 00:03:34,080
machine but um but actually the great

84
00:03:34,080 --> 00:03:36,270
thing is in the five years this actually

85
00:03:36,270 --> 00:03:37,710
something we've totally and utterly

86
00:03:37,710 --> 00:03:40,620
solved and I can now tell you the answer

87
00:03:40,620 --> 00:03:42,570
to this question which is good great

88
00:03:42,570 --> 00:03:44,970
because then you can people can stop

89
00:03:44,970 --> 00:03:46,500
answering at how never to answer it

90
00:03:46,500 --> 00:03:46,770
again

91
00:03:46,770 --> 00:03:51,420
so suspense we know we know all the

92
00:03:51,420 --> 00:03:54,990
answers containers one the developer

93
00:03:54,990 --> 00:03:57,300
experience absolutely everywhere you go

94
00:03:57,300 --> 00:03:58,980
developers are using containers

95
00:03:58,980 --> 00:04:01,470
developers love docker

96
00:04:01,470 --> 00:04:03,390
you know we're a developer experience

97
00:04:03,390 --> 00:04:04,890
company now as I said you know

98
00:04:04,890 --> 00:04:07,860
containers are everywhere the developers

99
00:04:07,860 --> 00:04:10,740
are you know if you look on even on the

100
00:04:10,740 --> 00:04:12,540
other side of things from the VMware

101
00:04:12,540 --> 00:04:14,130
that classic infrastructure company

102
00:04:14,130 --> 00:04:16,260
they've really pivoted to a container

103
00:04:16,260 --> 00:04:17,730
company they're shipping containers

104
00:04:17,730 --> 00:04:20,730
alongside their VMs kubernetes

105
00:04:20,730 --> 00:04:22,830
has risen up in the last five years to

106
00:04:22,830 --> 00:04:25,410
be absolutely everywhere everyone is

107
00:04:25,410 --> 00:04:27,000
using kubernetes is

108
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:31,700
enormous ly successful project you know

109
00:04:31,700 --> 00:04:34,020
everywhere you know containers have

110
00:04:34,020 --> 00:04:35,550
totally won and people talk about

111
00:04:35,550 --> 00:04:36,930
containers all the time

112
00:04:36,930 --> 00:04:39,180
people don't talk about vm's all the

113
00:04:39,180 --> 00:04:42,420
time and contains one innovation this is

114
00:04:42,420 --> 00:04:44,550
the CNC F landscape everyone kind of

115
00:04:44,550 --> 00:04:46,440
likes to laugh at the fact it's kind of

116
00:04:46,440 --> 00:04:48,720
there's so many things on it you can't

117
00:04:48,720 --> 00:04:50,850
even see what they all are and they're

118
00:04:50,850 --> 00:04:53,220
they they get increasingly small every

119
00:04:53,220 --> 00:04:56,160
time it's revised but if you think about

120
00:04:56,160 --> 00:04:59,160
it these are this is a measure of the

121
00:04:59,160 --> 00:05:00,930
amount of innovation there has been in

122
00:05:00,930 --> 00:05:04,500
the container space pretty much none of

123
00:05:04,500 --> 00:05:06,900
these things existed five years ago or

124
00:05:06,900 --> 00:05:08,370
you know if you look today probably have

125
00:05:08,370 --> 00:05:13,890
maybe four or five maybe that's more

126
00:05:13,890 --> 00:05:15,960
like ten whereas the container spaces

127
00:05:15,960 --> 00:05:17,610
brought all this enormous amount of

128
00:05:17,610 --> 00:05:20,480
ation and this innovation has been

129
00:05:20,480 --> 00:05:22,410
really exciting it's meant that we've

130
00:05:22,410 --> 00:05:24,240
you know being able to deliver software

131
00:05:24,240 --> 00:05:28,890
much faster and better more securely and

132
00:05:28,890 --> 00:05:33,390
like this has been a like a gigantic so

133
00:05:33,390 --> 00:05:36,450
amount of innovation just made by

134
00:05:36,450 --> 00:05:38,880
containers so that's you know that's

135
00:05:38,880 --> 00:05:42,660
kind of containers fro totally eclipsed

136
00:05:42,660 --> 00:05:43,950
the VM from that point of view but this

137
00:05:43,950 --> 00:05:45,210
is a security conference let's talk

138
00:05:45,210 --> 00:05:47,220
about the kind of the question because

139
00:05:47,220 --> 00:05:49,650
actually the containers versus VMs was

140
00:05:49,650 --> 00:05:51,660
often kind of implicitly really a

141
00:05:51,660 --> 00:05:54,419
security question not a UX question to a

142
00:05:54,419 --> 00:05:58,350
lot of people and here we've also

143
00:05:58,350 --> 00:06:00,570
actually got the answer really which is

144
00:06:00,570 --> 00:06:04,440
that fundamentally we've given up on

145
00:06:04,440 --> 00:06:08,030
Linux being as secure multi-tenant OS

146
00:06:08,030 --> 00:06:12,120
and what I mean by that is that you know

147
00:06:12,120 --> 00:06:15,479
there are no commercial services where

148
00:06:15,479 --> 00:06:18,450
people sell hosting of like you can run

149
00:06:18,450 --> 00:06:20,220
a container on here on the same machine

150
00:06:20,220 --> 00:06:21,930
as other people can run a container are

151
00:06:21,930 --> 00:06:27,110
on and you'll still be securely isolated

152
00:06:27,229 --> 00:06:30,870
there are you know containers can't do

153
00:06:30,870 --> 00:06:33,330
something if Louis cards and although

154
00:06:33,330 --> 00:06:34,740
they haven't been a lot of them there

155
00:06:34,740 --> 00:06:37,440
have been a bunch of exploits where if

156
00:06:37,440 --> 00:06:40,569
you've got user space access on Linux

157
00:06:40,569 --> 00:06:42,490
inside a container or inside an

158
00:06:42,490 --> 00:06:44,559
application inside a process and you've

159
00:06:44,559 --> 00:06:45,369
exploited it

160
00:06:45,369 --> 00:06:48,429
you can compromise the nurse colonel

161
00:06:48,429 --> 00:06:49,689
once you've compromised the nurse

162
00:06:49,689 --> 00:06:52,300
colonel you can compromise every other

163
00:06:52,300 --> 00:06:54,639
process on the on the machine and that's

164
00:06:54,639 --> 00:06:57,520
just you know they're not being a loss

165
00:06:57,520 --> 00:06:59,919
of things but they they do turn up

166
00:06:59,919 --> 00:07:03,069
regularly and there's no evidence that

167
00:07:03,069 --> 00:07:07,569
they're going to stop happening and you

168
00:07:07,569 --> 00:07:09,729
know there's a general view that you

169
00:07:09,729 --> 00:07:11,800
need to independent security layers for

170
00:07:11,800 --> 00:07:14,379
safe isolation this is a kind of this is

171
00:07:14,379 --> 00:07:16,749
a hard requirement at Google for example

172
00:07:16,749 --> 00:07:18,729
but in many other places as well

173
00:07:18,729 --> 00:07:20,949
two security layers to stop someone

174
00:07:20,949 --> 00:07:23,520
getting out and with the lens kernel API

175
00:07:23,520 --> 00:07:26,319
you've got one security layer and then

176
00:07:26,319 --> 00:07:31,110
you can't really protect any further and

177
00:07:31,110 --> 00:07:33,849
containers are just Linux remember that

178
00:07:33,849 --> 00:07:39,519
a large extent I mean they they can't if

179
00:07:39,519 --> 00:07:41,679
learners can't protect your application

180
00:07:41,679 --> 00:07:45,279
then the container cards I say no one

181
00:07:45,279 --> 00:07:47,949
sells a general-purpose multi-tenant

182
00:07:47,949 --> 00:07:49,209
hosting platform just based on those

183
00:07:49,209 --> 00:07:51,879
namespaces I mean there there are still

184
00:07:51,879 --> 00:07:55,599
just about web hosting providers selling

185
00:07:55,599 --> 00:07:59,199
Linux but these are kind of very these

186
00:07:59,199 --> 00:08:00,399
used to be a big thing and they're now

187
00:08:00,399 --> 00:08:02,529
very small area of the market and no one

188
00:08:02,529 --> 00:08:05,499
would argue that they're actually if I

189
00:08:05,499 --> 00:08:11,199
secure enough for a lot of use cases for

190
00:08:11,199 --> 00:08:13,029
most people this doesn't necessarily

191
00:08:13,029 --> 00:08:16,629
matter though like when it does matter

192
00:08:16,629 --> 00:08:20,829
whereas generally has been where you get

193
00:08:20,829 --> 00:08:22,689
this combination of VMs with container

194
00:08:22,689 --> 00:08:25,180
api's these kind of solve the container

195
00:08:25,180 --> 00:08:27,490
VM problem in different ways so if you

196
00:08:27,490 --> 00:08:29,349
look at services like Gavin's and a CI

197
00:08:29,349 --> 00:08:31,539
and AWS Fargate these are just little

198
00:08:31,539 --> 00:08:33,610
tiny lightweight VMs so they're running

199
00:08:33,610 --> 00:08:35,708
containers and provide a container side

200
00:08:35,708 --> 00:08:38,529
API you say I want to run a container

201
00:08:38,529 --> 00:08:41,169
Kathir containers is open source project

202
00:08:41,169 --> 00:08:44,198
to do the same thing and you can run

203
00:08:44,198 --> 00:08:47,529
that as as part of kubernetes the

204
00:08:47,529 --> 00:08:49,540
virtual qiblah project really is a kind

205
00:08:49,540 --> 00:08:50,829
of driver to

206
00:08:50,829 --> 00:08:54,999
to drive these types of container VM

207
00:08:54,999 --> 00:08:57,910
hybrids a few weeks ago we announced

208
00:08:57,910 --> 00:08:59,350
this collaboration with Microsoft to

209
00:08:59,350 --> 00:09:02,529
bring the kind of docker CLI to as you

210
00:09:02,529 --> 00:09:04,300
container instances so this will just

211
00:09:04,300 --> 00:09:06,369
mean you get the full doc experience you

212
00:09:06,369 --> 00:09:08,139
can do docker run you can do docker

213
00:09:08,139 --> 00:09:12,279
compose up but just not against you know

214
00:09:12,279 --> 00:09:14,019
the Linux kernels and was against the

215
00:09:14,019 --> 00:09:16,689
docker API but against the directly

216
00:09:16,689 --> 00:09:18,699
against the azure api which means that

217
00:09:18,699 --> 00:09:20,889
we're kind of taking like the docker

218
00:09:20,889 --> 00:09:23,769
experience and and making it work more

219
00:09:23,769 --> 00:09:27,429
broadly you can build things you can

220
00:09:27,429 --> 00:09:29,170
build this yourself with kind of cattle

221
00:09:29,170 --> 00:09:30,819
containers if you want to do how you

222
00:09:30,819 --> 00:09:33,549
know because you had a contains it's

223
00:09:33,549 --> 00:09:35,110
kind of a CI compatible so it looks like

224
00:09:35,110 --> 00:09:38,170
a normal container as well and so this

225
00:09:38,170 --> 00:09:40,980
kind of crossover has been the answer

226
00:09:40,980 --> 00:09:43,779
from the security and user usability

227
00:09:43,779 --> 00:09:45,549
point of view to basically bring these

228
00:09:45,549 --> 00:09:52,139
things together but in practice

229
00:09:52,139 --> 00:09:56,379
isolations kind of you know actually for

230
00:09:56,379 --> 00:09:58,389
most use cases where you're not running

231
00:09:58,389 --> 00:10:01,540
a commercial multi tenant service you

232
00:10:01,540 --> 00:10:04,119
know we've actually in the last five

233
00:10:04,119 --> 00:10:09,639
years only had maybe three rails

234
00:10:09,639 --> 00:10:13,660
zero-day container breakout escapes

235
00:10:13,660 --> 00:10:16,240
I think it's two or three it's very

236
00:10:16,240 --> 00:10:22,360
small number and containers came so far

237
00:10:22,360 --> 00:10:23,470
more likely to be due to miss

238
00:10:23,470 --> 00:10:26,559
configuration than actually a bug in the

239
00:10:26,559 --> 00:10:29,889
containers containers also provide

240
00:10:29,889 --> 00:10:31,389
better isolation than not using a

241
00:10:31,389 --> 00:10:33,970
container which is really the old center

242
00:10:33,970 --> 00:10:35,230
for a lot of people you know people is

243
00:10:35,230 --> 00:10:37,869
not run every process in a VM it's run

244
00:10:37,869 --> 00:10:40,959
every like it's run lots of processes

245
00:10:40,959 --> 00:10:42,160
together or run them in a container and

246
00:10:42,160 --> 00:10:44,019
containers better than nothing because

247
00:10:44,019 --> 00:10:47,139
it provides some isolation and much of

248
00:10:47,139 --> 00:10:48,730
the conversation about this sort of

249
00:10:48,730 --> 00:10:51,129
hardened isolation like multi-tenancy

250
00:10:51,129 --> 00:10:53,889
and things is not really it's a bit

251
00:10:53,889 --> 00:10:55,299
divorced from user concerns because most

252
00:10:55,299 --> 00:10:58,569
users are not running hard multi-tenant

253
00:10:58,569 --> 00:11:00,009
infrastructure running contests

254
00:11:00,009 --> 00:11:03,249
untrusted code from multiple users

255
00:11:03,249 --> 00:11:04,620
there's not

256
00:11:04,620 --> 00:11:06,910
it's not the use case for further

257
00:11:06,910 --> 00:11:08,800
majority of people so often these

258
00:11:08,800 --> 00:11:11,350
questions are kind of not the important

259
00:11:11,350 --> 00:11:12,610
question that's one of the things that

260
00:11:12,610 --> 00:11:14,649
you've noticed about those these five

261
00:11:14,649 --> 00:11:16,750
years is that we spent a lot of time

262
00:11:16,750 --> 00:11:18,670
talking about things that for a lot of

263
00:11:18,670 --> 00:11:20,620
people actually aren't the key things

264
00:11:20,620 --> 00:11:23,670
that don't matter that really matter

265
00:11:23,670 --> 00:11:26,050
what's a better future of this a bit

266
00:11:26,050 --> 00:11:27,279
having answered the question about

267
00:11:27,279 --> 00:11:30,910
containers versus vm's like what's going

268
00:11:30,910 --> 00:11:33,310
on in the space because it it it's like

269
00:11:33,310 --> 00:11:35,760
I secure isolation is just a fascinating

270
00:11:35,760 --> 00:11:39,390
area in the last five years we've had

271
00:11:39,390 --> 00:11:42,149
we've had spectrum meltdown and other

272
00:11:42,149 --> 00:11:45,550
side channel attacks on on hardware

273
00:11:45,550 --> 00:11:50,170
which actually really changed the kind

274
00:11:50,170 --> 00:11:52,149
of security landscape in in terms of

275
00:11:52,149 --> 00:11:55,330
what's going on so far these things have

276
00:11:55,330 --> 00:11:58,570
been fixed but a high cost in terms of

277
00:11:58,570 --> 00:12:01,450
performance you know we're talking about

278
00:12:01,450 --> 00:12:03,790
security patches with these things that

279
00:12:03,790 --> 00:12:05,830
depending on your workload might be ten

280
00:12:05,830 --> 00:12:07,720
percent worse or twenty percent worse

281
00:12:07,720 --> 00:12:09,400
there's some discussion about perches

282
00:12:09,400 --> 00:12:11,950
the other day about things being fifty

283
00:12:11,950 --> 00:12:17,410
percent worse I mean these are real real

284
00:12:17,410 --> 00:12:19,089
problems with side-channel tags and

285
00:12:19,089 --> 00:12:21,700
potentially there's threatens like the

286
00:12:21,700 --> 00:12:23,920
isolation of VM so far we've been ok but

287
00:12:23,920 --> 00:12:29,980
the you know the I'll talk about this a

288
00:12:29,980 --> 00:12:31,209
little bit more later but I mean like

289
00:12:31,209 --> 00:12:32,589
are we going to go back to bare metal

290
00:12:32,589 --> 00:12:34,690
are we going to have more layers of

291
00:12:34,690 --> 00:12:38,560
isolation even on VMs some this is this

292
00:12:38,560 --> 00:12:40,900
is kind of putting things at risk in

293
00:12:40,900 --> 00:12:42,700
terms of the way we expect things to be

294
00:12:42,700 --> 00:12:46,750
isolated in VMs now but then despite all

295
00:12:46,750 --> 00:12:50,160
this software isolation is coming back

296
00:12:50,160 --> 00:12:53,740
we've had browsers running untrusted

297
00:12:53,740 --> 00:12:57,010
javascript code for the last five years

298
00:12:57,010 --> 00:13:00,250
and it's been generally pretty secure

299
00:13:00,250 --> 00:13:04,870
it's been one of the most attacked areas

300
00:13:04,870 --> 00:13:07,600
there is and yet they haven't been you

301
00:13:07,600 --> 00:13:10,149
know it's proved to be relatively robust

302
00:13:10,149 --> 00:13:13,150
I mean there had been some exploits but

303
00:13:13,150 --> 00:13:17,079
as a security and practice model you

304
00:13:17,079 --> 00:13:18,100
know given it's the most

305
00:13:18,100 --> 00:13:20,350
attacked attack you know the most

306
00:13:20,350 --> 00:13:23,290
attacked from of isolation there is it's

307
00:13:23,290 --> 00:13:24,819
done pretty well so a lot of people

308
00:13:24,819 --> 00:13:28,050
started saying well despite things like

309
00:13:28,050 --> 00:13:30,970
the sergeant attacks had chili software

310
00:13:30,970 --> 00:13:33,639
isolation is kind of exciting and things

311
00:13:33,639 --> 00:13:36,339
like CloudFlare workers and fastly and

312
00:13:36,339 --> 00:13:37,990
people have been doing more exciting

313
00:13:37,990 --> 00:13:40,449
work on this they've reduced the API

314
00:13:40,449 --> 00:13:44,649
surface drastically to reduce the attack

315
00:13:44,649 --> 00:13:47,740
surface so CloudFlare doesn't provide

316
00:13:47,740 --> 00:13:50,440
accurate clocks to make timing attacks

317
00:13:50,440 --> 00:13:51,880
much more difficult and things like that

318
00:13:51,880 --> 00:13:53,980
so there's there's kind of API

319
00:13:53,980 --> 00:13:57,819
limitations but and then there's

320
00:13:57,819 --> 00:14:00,040
constant vigilance in terms of making

321
00:14:00,040 --> 00:14:01,990
you know making sure that things are not

322
00:14:01,990 --> 00:14:05,709
being you know monitoring attacks and

323
00:14:05,709 --> 00:14:06,759
then there's interesting projects like

324
00:14:06,759 --> 00:14:09,850
gee visor which reloads is less api's in

325
00:14:09,850 --> 00:14:13,000
go code in userspace has a more secure

326
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:14,649
way so there's some really interesting

327
00:14:14,649 --> 00:14:17,800
work going on in isolation that will

328
00:14:17,800 --> 00:14:22,899
affect the container space over time we

329
00:14:22,899 --> 00:14:25,209
if you look at you know the amount of

330
00:14:25,209 --> 00:14:28,000
work that players like Amazon are doing

331
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:29,380
if you look at what seems we're going on

332
00:14:29,380 --> 00:14:31,360
with lambda and Fargate they they're

333
00:14:31,360 --> 00:14:33,819
doing the multi the multi layered thing

334
00:14:33,819 --> 00:14:36,009
so there's like you don't get root

335
00:14:36,009 --> 00:14:37,750
access on lambda and you get even on

336
00:14:37,750 --> 00:14:39,670
forget you get very strict restricted

337
00:14:39,670 --> 00:14:41,500
root without like caps s admin and other

338
00:14:41,500 --> 00:14:43,630
capabilities you don't get to choose

339
00:14:43,630 --> 00:14:46,839
your kernel access that the VM is

340
00:14:46,839 --> 00:14:50,050
wrapped in firecracker which is highly

341
00:14:50,050 --> 00:14:53,079
written in rust to avoid all the issues

342
00:14:53,079 --> 00:14:54,579
that GM use had in the past with

343
00:14:54,579 --> 00:14:56,790
emulation is very minimal and very

344
00:14:56,790 --> 00:15:00,370
sandbox itself and then it's running a

345
00:15:00,370 --> 00:15:02,110
lockdown house so they're taking the

346
00:15:02,110 --> 00:15:05,079
view that with enough layers these

347
00:15:05,079 --> 00:15:07,350
services can continue running even if

348
00:15:07,350 --> 00:15:12,100
there are more exploits the cheap answer

349
00:15:12,100 --> 00:15:13,959
for multi turns here is just dictated

350
00:15:13,959 --> 00:15:16,060
things on different machines and that's

351
00:15:16,060 --> 00:15:17,980
going to become I think more more of a

352
00:15:17,980 --> 00:15:20,290
strategy of people over the long run run

353
00:15:20,290 --> 00:15:22,569
containers on bare metal with related

354
00:15:22,569 --> 00:15:25,490
workloads that you don't need

355
00:15:25,490 --> 00:15:30,860
protect from each other so in the second

356
00:15:30,860 --> 00:15:32,120
part really I want to talk about

357
00:15:32,120 --> 00:15:34,399
developer focus security because I think

358
00:15:34,399 --> 00:15:36,170
that's one of the things that we made a

359
00:15:36,170 --> 00:15:38,089
lot of mistakes around you know as I

360
00:15:38,089 --> 00:15:40,640
said the question of containers versus

361
00:15:40,640 --> 00:15:42,500
VMs is not really so much a developer

362
00:15:42,500 --> 00:15:44,630
question developers have already chosen

363
00:15:44,630 --> 00:15:47,450
containers largely and we've had this

364
00:15:47,450 --> 00:15:51,110
kind of thing in the security industry

365
00:15:51,110 --> 00:15:54,529
that's kind of you know fear sales we

366
00:15:54,529 --> 00:15:56,899
should sell security by fear and I think

367
00:15:56,899 --> 00:15:59,779
that's been a real kind of negative and

368
00:15:59,779 --> 00:16:02,240
we should be working with developers to

369
00:16:02,240 --> 00:16:03,800
sell them things you know that they

370
00:16:03,800 --> 00:16:07,279
actually want to use and you know this

371
00:16:07,279 --> 00:16:08,810
is a dev psych ops conference and I

372
00:16:08,810 --> 00:16:10,880
think this is what DevOps is

373
00:16:10,880 --> 00:16:12,980
fundamentally about is about bringing

374
00:16:12,980 --> 00:16:15,620
people together to do things they want

375
00:16:15,620 --> 00:16:19,580
to do better and developers often don't

376
00:16:19,580 --> 00:16:22,520
care about security but I think another

377
00:16:22,520 --> 00:16:23,660
thing that happened last five years

378
00:16:23,660 --> 00:16:25,459
really significant is let's encrypt so

379
00:16:25,459 --> 00:16:28,730
let's encrypt did two things one is

380
00:16:28,730 --> 00:16:30,680
there was an incentive to implement it

381
00:16:30,680 --> 00:16:33,079
because Google basically said your SEO

382
00:16:33,079 --> 00:16:36,200
will be worse if you don't have HTTPS

383
00:16:36,200 --> 00:16:38,240
and that was the sort of that was the

384
00:16:38,240 --> 00:16:40,940
stick and then the kind of carrot was it

385
00:16:40,940 --> 00:16:42,589
was very very easy

386
00:16:42,589 --> 00:16:45,980
it was automated like there was

387
00:16:45,980 --> 00:16:48,020
thousands of scripts and services to set

388
00:16:48,020 --> 00:16:52,010
it up and it you know we have we've gone

389
00:16:52,010 --> 00:16:57,410
from TLS being fairly rare and difficult

390
00:16:57,410 --> 00:17:00,980
and annoying to maintain to being pretty

391
00:17:00,980 --> 00:17:03,400
Universal it's 100% Universal but it's

392
00:17:03,400 --> 00:17:06,500
it's a massive change in really in a

393
00:17:06,500 --> 00:17:09,800
couple of years and it's really

394
00:17:09,800 --> 00:17:12,589
important that we you know that we make

395
00:17:12,589 --> 00:17:14,209
things easy to propose because if the

396
00:17:14,209 --> 00:17:16,189
wrappers have to choose they'll choose

397
00:17:16,189 --> 00:17:20,869
the insecure default option even if it's

398
00:17:20,869 --> 00:17:21,980
document is insecure

399
00:17:21,980 --> 00:17:24,109
even if they have to write - - really I

400
00:17:24,109 --> 00:17:25,849
want to do this thing this is a terrible

401
00:17:25,849 --> 00:17:27,920
idea on the flags and the confi they'll

402
00:17:27,920 --> 00:17:32,450
still do it but if it's easy and if the

403
00:17:32,450 --> 00:17:34,700
secure thing is difficult and we Furr

404
00:17:34,700 --> 00:17:37,440
there's been a bunch of examples

405
00:17:37,440 --> 00:17:40,470
in the last five years one of the things

406
00:17:40,470 --> 00:17:42,210
that still happen still find out

407
00:17:42,210 --> 00:17:43,919
sometimes is that you know people are

408
00:17:43,919 --> 00:17:46,919
running darker exposed to the internet

409
00:17:46,919 --> 00:17:49,769
without any authentication at all so

410
00:17:49,769 --> 00:17:52,950
that you can just you know it's just the

411
00:17:52,950 --> 00:17:55,169
docker socket is there your house you're

412
00:17:55,169 --> 00:17:56,700
giving someone root access to your host

413
00:17:56,700 --> 00:17:58,409
and there's not a lot of these thing

414
00:17:58,409 --> 00:18:02,370
these days but they've all and they've

415
00:18:02,370 --> 00:18:04,409
all been compromised already probably

416
00:18:04,409 --> 00:18:07,190
but it's just really really difficult

417
00:18:07,190 --> 00:18:11,250
and the setup you were supposed to do

418
00:18:11,250 --> 00:18:12,840
when we introduced you know remote

419
00:18:12,840 --> 00:18:15,620
docker so because we set up mutual TLS

420
00:18:15,620 --> 00:18:18,690
but mutual TLS is really hard for people

421
00:18:18,690 --> 00:18:21,330
to understand setup and use it's I would

422
00:18:21,330 --> 00:18:25,620
say generally don't use mutual TLS and a

423
00:18:25,620 --> 00:18:27,870
service that people are supposed to use

424
00:18:27,870 --> 00:18:30,539
if it's for computer to computer

425
00:18:30,539 --> 00:18:32,759
services it can be made to work and lots

426
00:18:32,759 --> 00:18:35,429
of service meshes actually help automate

427
00:18:35,429 --> 00:18:38,100
that of service to service things but

428
00:18:38,100 --> 00:18:40,799
for things that humans have to access

429
00:18:40,799 --> 00:18:43,340
it's a really really bad idea

430
00:18:43,340 --> 00:18:45,809
we eventually in Dhaka we added support

431
00:18:45,809 --> 00:18:49,590
to connect a tunnel over SSH to a remote

432
00:18:49,590 --> 00:18:51,149
machine which is probably what we should

433
00:18:51,149 --> 00:18:52,620
have done in the first place is the only

434
00:18:52,620 --> 00:18:57,269
option it's still not everyone knows

435
00:18:57,269 --> 00:18:59,490
that it exists because it's only been

436
00:18:59,490 --> 00:19:01,230
around for two years

437
00:19:01,230 --> 00:19:04,679
and you know people take a long time and

438
00:19:04,679 --> 00:19:06,240
there's there's all documents and blog

439
00:19:06,240 --> 00:19:08,759
posts and things that tell people what

440
00:19:08,759 --> 00:19:13,320
to do you know and people people hear

441
00:19:13,320 --> 00:19:15,269
about things and use things and said

442
00:19:15,269 --> 00:19:16,919
things happen in secure ways that

443
00:19:16,919 --> 00:19:18,929
they've heard the best thing is never to

444
00:19:18,929 --> 00:19:20,490
add the insecure options in the first

445
00:19:20,490 --> 00:19:23,730
place because our experience has just

446
00:19:23,730 --> 00:19:25,200
been that migrating people away from

447
00:19:25,200 --> 00:19:27,210
using these things it's just really

448
00:19:27,210 --> 00:19:31,740
really slow and and kind of it's

449
00:19:31,740 --> 00:19:33,149
difficult another thing I'm going to

450
00:19:33,149 --> 00:19:35,580
talk about more about naturey and image

451
00:19:35,580 --> 00:19:39,509
signatures before but again we made it

452
00:19:39,509 --> 00:19:41,309
opt-in and not how many people have

453
00:19:41,309 --> 00:19:43,769
opted into it and so naturally v2 we're

454
00:19:43,769 --> 00:19:45,419
working trying to fix this but the

455
00:19:45,419 --> 00:19:46,889
original design we did for signing

456
00:19:46,889 --> 00:19:49,289
actually signed all images had another

457
00:19:49,289 --> 00:19:50,150
problem

458
00:19:50,150 --> 00:19:52,530
it was actually has no who would

459
00:19:52,530 --> 00:19:54,870
actually sign the image because there

460
00:19:54,870 --> 00:19:56,640
wasn't a very good key distribution

461
00:19:56,640 --> 00:19:58,470
mechanism better you know if it was

462
00:19:58,470 --> 00:20:01,050
opt-in and that was in many ways they're

463
00:20:01,050 --> 00:20:04,560
kind of better design although arguably

464
00:20:04,560 --> 00:20:06,690
it was to arguably it was just confusing

465
00:20:06,690 --> 00:20:07,950
because you didn't know what the keys

466
00:20:07,950 --> 00:20:10,590
were anyway but so it was a in some ways

467
00:20:10,590 --> 00:20:12,390
half a design and we were spending a lot

468
00:20:12,390 --> 00:20:14,160
of time discussing these issues with

469
00:20:14,160 --> 00:20:16,010
notary Vito they may not talk about that

470
00:20:16,010 --> 00:20:19,680
in a minute but again like opt in if you

471
00:20:19,680 --> 00:20:21,090
make something opt-in that's a security

472
00:20:21,090 --> 00:20:23,190
feature people will just choose not to

473
00:20:23,190 --> 00:20:26,430
opt in and you know very few people will

474
00:20:26,430 --> 00:20:30,230
obtain you just have to turn it on

475
00:20:30,740 --> 00:20:33,420
things I'm really not sure about that we

476
00:20:33,420 --> 00:20:40,950
did um I maybe and Jesse Frisell worked

477
00:20:40,950 --> 00:20:43,860
on the docker second policy is one of

478
00:20:43,860 --> 00:20:47,370
the first things I did a docker and I'm

479
00:20:47,370 --> 00:20:49,910
coming around to the view that actually

480
00:20:49,910 --> 00:20:54,470
I'm not sure how useful it is anymore

481
00:20:54,560 --> 00:21:00,860
we took samox then we started using it

482
00:21:00,860 --> 00:21:03,840
reduce the Linux kernel attack surface

483
00:21:03,840 --> 00:21:06,240
by doing things in docker and I don't

484
00:21:06,240 --> 00:21:08,490
know that that's the right place to do

485
00:21:08,490 --> 00:21:11,700
that and to some extent a lot of that

486
00:21:11,700 --> 00:21:14,190
has got better anyway a lot of learners

487
00:21:14,190 --> 00:21:15,840
distributions have tightened up their

488
00:21:15,840 --> 00:21:19,430
kernel security settings back since then

489
00:21:19,430 --> 00:21:25,620
and so you so things a little bit better

490
00:21:25,620 --> 00:21:28,380
than they used to be there's a

491
00:21:28,380 --> 00:21:31,860
performance impact that although not

492
00:21:31,860 --> 00:21:33,720
everyone notices that is actually

493
00:21:33,720 --> 00:21:35,850
problematic for some applications if you

494
00:21:35,850 --> 00:21:40,620
do a lot of dis calls and seccomp was

495
00:21:40,620 --> 00:21:42,690
actually designed for programs to do

496
00:21:42,690 --> 00:21:48,690
their own security configure then for it

497
00:21:48,690 --> 00:21:50,610
to be set by system administrators and

498
00:21:50,610 --> 00:21:52,110
that we're trying to we were trying to

499
00:21:52,110 --> 00:21:53,640
basically do that as a kind of global

500
00:21:53,640 --> 00:21:58,130
policy it's really hard to use and so

501
00:21:58,130 --> 00:22:00,720
the kind of the Russian are we had was

502
00:22:00,720 --> 00:22:04,050
that we could we could

503
00:22:04,050 --> 00:22:05,340
because it was really hard to apply

504
00:22:05,340 --> 00:22:07,560
second policy had almost no applications

505
00:22:07,560 --> 00:22:09,240
had their own CENTCOM policy so it was

506
00:22:09,240 --> 00:22:11,610
kind of better if we provided one that

507
00:22:11,610 --> 00:22:14,370
did at least something but it's actually

508
00:22:14,370 --> 00:22:19,260
it's kind of minimal what it can do and

509
00:22:19,260 --> 00:22:21,660
it's it's not clear that it's really

510
00:22:21,660 --> 00:22:23,250
worth it there are there are huge

511
00:22:23,250 --> 00:22:25,500
numbers of issues with seccomp and

512
00:22:25,500 --> 00:22:28,200
there's actually some people working on

513
00:22:28,200 --> 00:22:29,730
actually improving it at this point so

514
00:22:29,730 --> 00:22:31,050
maybe it'll get a little bit better but

515
00:22:31,050 --> 00:22:32,280
it's got all those problems like every

516
00:22:32,280 --> 00:22:34,920
time this is calls that your your

517
00:22:34,920 --> 00:22:36,600
operating system uses change you have to

518
00:22:36,600 --> 00:22:39,000
change your policies and people there's

519
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:40,860
oh that turns out to happen like

520
00:22:40,860 --> 00:22:45,210
regularly at one point we break our

521
00:22:45,210 --> 00:22:48,450
second policy and darker breaks team and

522
00:22:48,450 --> 00:22:50,700
so we were really unpopular because it

523
00:22:50,700 --> 00:22:52,760
has a lot of people on steam and docker

524
00:22:52,760 --> 00:22:55,200
you know these are it's been uh it's

525
00:22:55,200 --> 00:22:57,450
been all over burden and I'm really not

526
00:22:57,450 --> 00:22:59,700
sure about the cost-benefit analysis on

527
00:22:59,700 --> 00:23:04,110
this any more things that I am more

528
00:23:04,110 --> 00:23:05,220
happy about that we've done the last

529
00:23:05,220 --> 00:23:06,300
five years

530
00:23:06,300 --> 00:23:09,060
I think we did generally choose the

531
00:23:09,060 --> 00:23:11,520
right default security for darker with

532
00:23:11,520 --> 00:23:13,080
the exception of this whole thing about

533
00:23:13,080 --> 00:23:15,860
cap net raw I did a talk with Liz rice

534
00:23:15,860 --> 00:23:18,000
Dokic on just a few weeks ago but lack

535
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:20,280
of self isolation where we talked about

536
00:23:20,280 --> 00:23:23,580
the further we gave containers more

537
00:23:23,580 --> 00:23:24,870
capabilities than they should really

538
00:23:24,870 --> 00:23:26,310
have had and which has caused some

539
00:23:26,310 --> 00:23:30,170
vulnerabilities but we did it because we

540
00:23:30,170 --> 00:23:33,210
wanted people to be able to use ping and

541
00:23:33,210 --> 00:23:36,600
I have a over the years there's some

542
00:23:36,600 --> 00:23:38,730
ways that we've that those destroy

543
00:23:38,730 --> 00:23:39,960
doesn't matter to work around the fact

544
00:23:39,960 --> 00:23:43,170
that ping requires cabinet rolls so I

545
00:23:43,170 --> 00:23:44,910
think we can actually fix this but apart

546
00:23:44,910 --> 00:23:46,560
from that generally we did choose good

547
00:23:46,560 --> 00:23:49,800
two folds for some years

548
00:23:49,800 --> 00:23:52,050
jesse Frisell my tennis soccer security

549
00:23:52,050 --> 00:23:55,020
non-events page which said all the

550
00:23:55,020 --> 00:23:57,390
things that taco protected against this

551
00:23:57,390 --> 00:23:58,620
game were some of the things that the

552
00:23:58,620 --> 00:24:00,420
second policy did block but they were

553
00:24:00,420 --> 00:24:01,500
also bunch of things that we couldn't

554
00:24:01,500 --> 00:24:03,570
block with SEC comp and use of the

555
00:24:03,570 --> 00:24:05,100
complexity

556
00:24:05,100 --> 00:24:07,530
and some of it was due to user knows

557
00:24:07,530 --> 00:24:10,110
bases which is just the one kind of area

558
00:24:10,110 --> 00:24:11,760
that really bit did increase the attack

559
00:24:11,760 --> 00:24:14,700
surface but again some learns destroys

560
00:24:14,700 --> 00:24:16,350
let you just turn that off and those

561
00:24:16,350 --> 00:24:19,650
other you know but it is useful I mean

562
00:24:19,650 --> 00:24:21,870
it's like we've kind of ruled out people

563
00:24:21,870 --> 00:24:24,030
using username spaces for good things by

564
00:24:24,030 --> 00:24:26,929
trying to reduce the attacks service so

565
00:24:26,929 --> 00:24:29,429
that's I'm a bit of evidence about that

566
00:24:29,429 --> 00:24:32,520
and then the other thing I'm happy about

567
00:24:32,520 --> 00:24:33,900
all the major security issues in the

568
00:24:33,900 --> 00:24:35,700
ecosystem which is guys responsibly and

569
00:24:35,700 --> 00:24:37,440
as far as I know no one lad she got

570
00:24:37,440 --> 00:24:38,880
attacked by these things they were

571
00:24:38,880 --> 00:24:41,669
pretty obscure generally and communities

572
00:24:41,669 --> 00:24:43,980
being quite good at working together on

573
00:24:43,980 --> 00:24:47,340
security issues across different

574
00:24:47,340 --> 00:24:49,080
companies and things like that which is

575
00:24:49,080 --> 00:24:52,470
great um another thing I really want to

576
00:24:52,470 --> 00:24:54,510
talk about because really I think it's

577
00:24:54,510 --> 00:24:57,659
been a huge force for change and it's

578
00:24:57,659 --> 00:25:00,720
really just starting is the CNC f6

579
00:25:00,720 --> 00:25:03,330
security this was originally the safe

580
00:25:03,330 --> 00:25:05,340
working group secure access for everyone

581
00:25:05,340 --> 00:25:09,630
in 2018 and became an official security

582
00:25:09,630 --> 00:25:12,059
working group and in particular became a

583
00:25:12,059 --> 00:25:13,980
community of people who are interested

584
00:25:13,980 --> 00:25:18,210
in cloud native security and I I've been

585
00:25:18,210 --> 00:25:20,070
involved for you know a long time and I

586
00:25:20,070 --> 00:25:22,350
think it's incredibly valuable and I

587
00:25:22,350 --> 00:25:24,210
think the biggest thing I've seen coming

588
00:25:24,210 --> 00:25:25,799
out of this and you know in really in

589
00:25:25,799 --> 00:25:29,010
the last couple of years is that end

590
00:25:29,010 --> 00:25:31,860
users who are like using kubernetes and

591
00:25:31,860 --> 00:25:33,510
using cloud nation software are coming

592
00:25:33,510 --> 00:25:35,070
out and so into share and open source

593
00:25:35,070 --> 00:25:37,740
the tools they use and the way they

594
00:25:37,740 --> 00:25:39,270
think about things and the security

595
00:25:39,270 --> 00:25:41,549
issues they've been having and this is

596
00:25:41,549 --> 00:25:46,440
still a a new thing but it's absolutely

597
00:25:46,440 --> 00:25:50,669
the best way to actually like progress

598
00:25:50,669 --> 00:25:52,140
the ecosystem and evolve everyone

599
00:25:52,140 --> 00:25:53,970
together secure you know so here's he

600
00:25:53,970 --> 00:25:58,080
driven by what what the users the

601
00:25:58,080 --> 00:25:59,730
problem the real problems real users are

602
00:25:59,730 --> 00:26:02,280
having in production is incredibly

603
00:26:02,280 --> 00:26:04,919
valuable in this community and also

604
00:26:04,919 --> 00:26:07,080
security has a cool i'm tresh branded

605
00:26:07,080 --> 00:26:08,880
logo which you know it's very important

606
00:26:08,880 --> 00:26:12,559
so come and come along and join

607
00:26:13,469 --> 00:26:16,029
looking forward those those kind of

608
00:26:16,029 --> 00:26:18,759
trends of cooperation and security I

609
00:26:18,759 --> 00:26:22,089
think is the thing that has changed most

610
00:26:22,089 --> 00:26:23,859
I think we're working together an awful

611
00:26:23,859 --> 00:26:25,659
lot more than we were five years ago and

612
00:26:25,659 --> 00:26:27,789
I think that's right incredibly valuable

613
00:26:27,789 --> 00:26:32,289
and the notary v2 I talked to a

614
00:26:32,289 --> 00:26:35,889
deliverer forward last late last year we

615
00:26:35,889 --> 00:26:38,289
kicked off noise revita whoo so notary

616
00:26:38,289 --> 00:26:39,729
if you don't know it is a project for

617
00:26:39,729 --> 00:26:41,739
signing container images so that if you

618
00:26:41,739 --> 00:26:44,619
want to know where they you know where

619
00:26:44,619 --> 00:26:46,889
they came from who who built them and

620
00:26:46,889 --> 00:26:49,779
you know make sure that they're actually

621
00:26:49,779 --> 00:26:51,190
the right container image that you

622
00:26:51,190 --> 00:26:54,099
wanted and that they've it's a project

623
00:26:54,099 --> 00:26:56,200
for adding critic Rafic signatures to

624
00:26:56,200 --> 00:26:57,789
them and we started working on v2

625
00:26:57,789 --> 00:27:00,849
because of a bunch of issues they want

626
00:27:00,849 --> 00:27:03,249
but this from the beginning was a joint

627
00:27:03,249 --> 00:27:06,609
project between per tick tock Amazon as

628
00:27:06,609 --> 00:27:09,789
you in particular but also the update

629
00:27:09,789 --> 00:27:12,369
framework team largely based at NYU and

630
00:27:12,369 --> 00:27:15,269
elsewhere his and Brett Harris and other

631
00:27:15,269 --> 00:27:16,869
there's actually a bunch of other

632
00:27:16,869 --> 00:27:19,359
vendors than they and other people in

633
00:27:19,359 --> 00:27:20,950
the ecosystem as well J froggen people

634
00:27:20,950 --> 00:27:22,989
have been involved so it's a really a

635
00:27:22,989 --> 00:27:25,419
community effort from day one to work on

636
00:27:25,419 --> 00:27:27,039
a single solution that works for

637
00:27:27,039 --> 00:27:29,619
everyone's customer needs that's meant

638
00:27:29,619 --> 00:27:33,009
that you know it's take is taking time

639
00:27:33,009 --> 00:27:37,209
because it it's sometimes you know it's

640
00:27:37,209 --> 00:27:38,739
feels difficult there's lots of

641
00:27:38,739 --> 00:27:40,749
different ransom needs and we you know

642
00:27:40,749 --> 00:27:43,209
we have to work together but the

643
00:27:43,209 --> 00:27:45,339
important thing is that we'll get a

644
00:27:45,339 --> 00:27:47,559
consensus of what everyone wants you

645
00:27:47,559 --> 00:27:48,429
know whether it's something that

646
00:27:48,429 --> 00:27:50,219
everyone gets behind at the end widget

647
00:27:50,219 --> 00:27:56,529
and everyone was a part currently not

648
00:27:56,529 --> 00:27:58,419
all registry support signatures at all

649
00:27:58,419 --> 00:28:00,909
the signatures are not portable between

650
00:28:00,909 --> 00:28:02,950
registries which is really important so

651
00:28:02,950 --> 00:28:05,139
we want it so that you can sign a rich

652
00:28:05,139 --> 00:28:07,539
so an image and then that information

653
00:28:07,539 --> 00:28:09,129
that signature can be transferred

654
00:28:09,129 --> 00:28:11,859
elsewhere so that it's a single supply

655
00:28:11,859 --> 00:28:13,690
chain regardless of how you actually use

656
00:28:13,690 --> 00:28:19,269
registries on your way production um you

657
00:28:19,269 --> 00:28:20,919
know as Security's difficult and working

658
00:28:20,919 --> 00:28:23,109
together just makes it easier I think

659
00:28:23,109 --> 00:28:26,150
and you know we've we've had a you know

660
00:28:26,150 --> 00:28:27,800
lot of input and yeah sometimes it feels

661
00:28:27,800 --> 00:28:29,450
like it's taking a long time but it's

662
00:28:29,450 --> 00:28:33,320
also it just coming up with something

663
00:28:33,320 --> 00:28:35,600
and trying to impose it on people is not

664
00:28:35,600 --> 00:28:37,370
not the way we're going to get something

665
00:28:37,370 --> 00:28:40,220
secure you know it takes time to look at

666
00:28:40,220 --> 00:28:42,710
the security and work out what the you

667
00:28:42,710 --> 00:28:45,530
know whether it whether your threat

668
00:28:45,530 --> 00:28:50,540
model is you know whether that this

669
00:28:50,540 --> 00:28:52,340
particular thing sells your fright model

670
00:28:52,340 --> 00:28:53,810
what the issues are what the bugs are

671
00:28:53,810 --> 00:28:55,660
what they all those kinds of things

672
00:28:55,660 --> 00:28:58,130
another thing which we're doing in the

673
00:28:58,130 --> 00:29:00,320
very developer focus security is sneakin

674
00:29:00,320 --> 00:29:02,450
docker working together and we announced

675
00:29:02,450 --> 00:29:04,010
a few weeks ago that we're doing a joint

676
00:29:04,010 --> 00:29:06,380
solution for scanning a security CV

677
00:29:06,380 --> 00:29:07,850
scanning on docker desktop and docker

678
00:29:07,850 --> 00:29:12,650
hub we really want to make scanning more

679
00:29:12,650 --> 00:29:14,120
widespread and easily available there

680
00:29:14,120 --> 00:29:15,770
are millions of users on docker tests up

681
00:29:15,770 --> 00:29:17,180
and all of them are going to have access

682
00:29:17,180 --> 00:29:21,620
to security scanning and this is and

683
00:29:21,620 --> 00:29:23,780
will go forward and you know this is a

684
00:29:23,780 --> 00:29:25,760
program that we're going to go forward

685
00:29:25,760 --> 00:29:27,440
and make and make it easier for

686
00:29:27,440 --> 00:29:29,210
developers to understand use scanning

687
00:29:29,210 --> 00:29:32,360
together and we want to help people act

688
00:29:32,360 --> 00:29:34,490
on security issues easily there's you

689
00:29:34,490 --> 00:29:38,060
know it's something that you don't want

690
00:29:38,060 --> 00:29:39,740
to just be information overload you've

691
00:29:39,740 --> 00:29:41,990
already wanted to have you know focused

692
00:29:41,990 --> 00:29:47,240
this is what you need to do and we're

693
00:29:47,240 --> 00:29:49,280
really you know pleased to be working

694
00:29:49,280 --> 00:29:50,720
with me we don't want to you know we

695
00:29:50,720 --> 00:29:52,570
this is something that you need us

696
00:29:52,570 --> 00:29:54,350
specialists like sneakers in the

697
00:29:54,350 --> 00:29:57,020
scanning business and then we're really

698
00:29:57,020 --> 00:30:00,620
interested on making the UX better and

699
00:30:00,620 --> 00:30:02,630
helping our you know helping our users

700
00:30:02,630 --> 00:30:04,730
actually use scanning effectively and

701
00:30:04,730 --> 00:30:09,490
that's really good and I think that

702
00:30:09,490 --> 00:30:11,870
going forwards you know they think that

703
00:30:11,870 --> 00:30:16,700
the it's been really exciting watching

704
00:30:16,700 --> 00:30:18,410
these projects in the CN CF that have

705
00:30:18,410 --> 00:30:20,510
been security projects such as you know

706
00:30:20,510 --> 00:30:23,600
spiffy and every a policy agent at our

707
00:30:23,600 --> 00:30:25,460
Falco and things these are open-source

708
00:30:25,460 --> 00:30:27,650
security projects it's time to see real

709
00:30:27,650 --> 00:30:31,150
momentum and real users and those

710
00:30:31,150 --> 00:30:33,620
historically open source and security

711
00:30:33,620 --> 00:30:36,620
were often despite everything not things

712
00:30:36,620 --> 00:30:38,700
that went together very well and

713
00:30:38,700 --> 00:30:42,640
it's nice to see the security companies

714
00:30:42,640 --> 00:30:44,050
like aqua for example have an

715
00:30:44,050 --> 00:30:45,550
open-source team now doing open source

716
00:30:45,550 --> 00:30:47,140
projects liz is working on that's really

717
00:30:47,140 --> 00:30:49,870
great to see I think that there's going

718
00:30:49,870 --> 00:30:54,100
to be a lot more open source in security

719
00:30:54,100 --> 00:30:55,300
and some a lot of it's going to be

720
00:30:55,300 --> 00:30:56,980
driven by end users which is going to be

721
00:30:56,980 --> 00:30:58,180
really exciting and I'm really excited

722
00:30:58,180 --> 00:31:02,080
to see their developer experience is

723
00:31:02,080 --> 00:31:04,270
really important and security has to be

724
00:31:04,270 --> 00:31:06,520
there you know by defaults it's not not

725
00:31:06,520 --> 00:31:07,300
as an Adonis

726
00:31:07,300 --> 00:31:08,800
it's got to be turned on from the

727
00:31:08,800 --> 00:31:14,020
beginning and so it's been an exciting

728
00:31:14,020 --> 00:31:18,600
five years I mean it's it's it's um

729
00:31:18,600 --> 00:31:21,040
deficit cops is something that because

730
00:31:21,040 --> 00:31:22,270
if their word has been around for a

731
00:31:22,270 --> 00:31:26,290
while but I know I it's funny when

732
00:31:26,290 --> 00:31:28,240
DevOps happened I was like oh yes this

733
00:31:28,240 --> 00:31:29,530
makes sense to me I've been a deaf

734
00:31:29,530 --> 00:31:32,290
person and an OPS person in my time am I

735
00:31:32,290 --> 00:31:34,810
used to you know is to do ops before I

736
00:31:34,810 --> 00:31:37,840
did my full-time and then I kind of

737
00:31:37,840 --> 00:31:40,000
moved into security is later I think

738
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:42,400
security is not you know these are

739
00:31:42,400 --> 00:31:44,740
things that you shouldn't just be in one

740
00:31:44,740 --> 00:31:47,560
of those buckets all the time because

741
00:31:47,560 --> 00:31:50,050
security is hard and therefore people

742
00:31:50,050 --> 00:31:51,940
sit in the security bucket and it's

743
00:31:51,940 --> 00:31:53,620
really important to have deep

744
00:31:53,620 --> 00:31:56,050
specialists on things because there are

745
00:31:56,050 --> 00:31:57,760
really deep and interesting problems and

746
00:31:57,760 --> 00:32:01,450
security that like are just very very

747
00:32:01,450 --> 00:32:04,300
difficult and people can make mistakes

748
00:32:04,300 --> 00:32:08,500
if very easily and and there's a there's

749
00:32:08,500 --> 00:32:10,750
a people who are good at taking very

750
00:32:10,750 --> 00:32:12,280
specialist things and turn them to

751
00:32:12,280 --> 00:32:13,450
things that are harder to me mister

752
00:32:13,450 --> 00:32:14,980
mistakes which is a really valuable

753
00:32:14,980 --> 00:32:18,730
special isn't to but I think everyone

754
00:32:18,730 --> 00:32:20,350
should spend some time working in

755
00:32:20,350 --> 00:32:22,540
security and I hope like people spend

756
00:32:22,540 --> 00:32:25,210
some time in container security there's

757
00:32:25,210 --> 00:32:26,890
a there's a huge field of container

758
00:32:26,890 --> 00:32:29,620
security and I think that you can you

759
00:32:29,620 --> 00:32:30,850
know spend a little time becoming an

760
00:32:30,850 --> 00:32:32,470
expert in an area of contain security

761
00:32:32,470 --> 00:32:35,850
and it's really really valuable and

762
00:32:35,850 --> 00:32:38,080
spend time working with security people

763
00:32:38,080 --> 00:32:39,730
understanding how they think and

764
00:32:39,730 --> 00:32:41,410
understanding how to talk to them is

765
00:32:41,410 --> 00:32:43,720
valuable I think soon as you have

766
00:32:43,720 --> 00:32:45,340
security is a good place to if you want

767
00:32:45,340 --> 00:32:47,770
to find some people who and see what

768
00:32:47,770 --> 00:32:48,670
they're talking about and what they're

769
00:32:48,670 --> 00:32:51,180
interested in

770
00:32:51,270 --> 00:32:53,430
we're still I mean we've still got to

771
00:32:53,430 --> 00:32:55,080
work really hard on making security

772
00:32:55,080 --> 00:32:59,520
usable and pervasive and always on and

773
00:32:59,520 --> 00:33:01,650
and that's it's a really hard problem

774
00:33:01,650 --> 00:33:03,690
and it's you know we can definitely

775
00:33:03,690 --> 00:33:05,400
spend the next five years doing that be

776
00:33:05,400 --> 00:33:07,230
an incredibly valuable thing to do and I

777
00:33:07,230 --> 00:33:11,430
think that that's you know the way to

778
00:33:11,430 --> 00:33:13,590
approach it is is to spend time with

779
00:33:13,590 --> 00:33:15,780
users spend time with developers and and

780
00:33:15,780 --> 00:33:19,770
find their concerns and just make things

781
00:33:19,770 --> 00:33:22,380
easy because hard things are just hard

782
00:33:22,380 --> 00:33:25,800
and we we can't all be experts in

783
00:33:25,800 --> 00:33:28,020
everything and if security if you have

784
00:33:28,020 --> 00:33:31,290
to be a security expert on everything it

785
00:33:31,290 --> 00:33:32,940
would be really hard to ship things at

786
00:33:32,940 --> 00:33:34,950
all but so we need to package things up

787
00:33:34,950 --> 00:33:37,380
you know think of the Lexx encrypt model

788
00:33:37,380 --> 00:33:39,780
you know this is a hard thing package to

789
00:33:39,780 --> 00:33:41,760
make it easy and those are the kinds of

790
00:33:41,760 --> 00:33:43,770
things that we need to achieve more

791
00:33:43,770 --> 00:33:48,060
often in container security really so

792
00:33:48,060 --> 00:33:50,610
thanks very much and happy to take

793
00:33:50,610 --> 00:33:51,780
questions here and it's been really

794
00:33:51,780 --> 00:33:55,220
great presenting to you this online

795
00:33:55,220 --> 00:33:57,480
conference thing is quite good fun

796
00:33:57,480 --> 00:34:02,550
really am but so I'm I hope you enjoy

797
00:34:02,550 --> 00:34:10,560
the rest of the day how'd you follow my

798
00:34:10,560 --> 00:34:12,540
conferencing then compared to compared

799
00:34:12,540 --> 00:34:15,480
to say physical because obviously you

800
00:34:15,480 --> 00:34:17,159
can't see the yeah you can't see the

801
00:34:17,159 --> 00:34:19,440
audience right so yeah I know not seeing

802
00:34:19,440 --> 00:34:22,409
the audience's is actually kind of rude

803
00:34:22,409 --> 00:34:24,719
I actually I actually meant to set up

804
00:34:24,719 --> 00:34:26,399
the the online chat so I could see it

805
00:34:26,399 --> 00:34:28,649
other corner of my eye but it's actually

806
00:34:28,649 --> 00:34:30,389
you can't concentrate on a desk it's

807
00:34:30,389 --> 00:34:32,159
just maybe but it's kind of it'd be nice

808
00:34:32,159 --> 00:34:34,290
to just sort of have it just so you can

809
00:34:34,290 --> 00:34:36,860
see there there really are people there

810
00:34:36,860 --> 00:34:40,469
I don't know because that's the weirdest

811
00:34:40,469 --> 00:34:43,980
thing is just talking to let's talk it

812
00:34:43,980 --> 00:34:45,239
you know just talking with and you can't

813
00:34:45,239 --> 00:34:46,889
see anyone I mean it and I said when you

814
00:34:46,889 --> 00:34:48,719
get in the flow it's not that different

815
00:34:48,719 --> 00:34:49,980
from being at a conference because you

816
00:34:49,980 --> 00:34:53,820
don't really I mean you mostly don't

817
00:34:53,820 --> 00:34:55,440
answer questions during that's a lot

818
00:34:55,440 --> 00:34:57,120
well sometimes I do but you know you

819
00:34:57,120 --> 00:34:58,650
generally just have a sort of sense of

820
00:34:58,650 --> 00:35:01,260
the audience there but it's just very

821
00:35:01,260 --> 00:35:03,270
only getting the flow it's fine but it's

822
00:35:03,270 --> 00:35:04,630
just that sort of

823
00:35:04,630 --> 00:35:08,520
lack of feedback is a very we're sure Oh

824
00:35:08,520 --> 00:35:11,230
couple of questions here for you Justin

825
00:35:11,230 --> 00:35:15,280
first one coming in from Alice can we

826
00:35:15,280 --> 00:35:18,220
trace our containers with EVPs to create

827
00:35:18,220 --> 00:35:22,810
a second profile for our containers yes

828
00:35:22,810 --> 00:35:24,570
you can

829
00:35:24,570 --> 00:35:28,300
yeah absolutely you don't actually need

830
00:35:28,300 --> 00:35:30,820
to use EP if there are some blogging

831
00:35:30,820 --> 00:35:33,130
modes for sick on burn some and you can

832
00:35:33,130 --> 00:35:35,290
do with the audit but the EPF so kind of

833
00:35:35,290 --> 00:35:36,730
nice way of doing it and there's the e

834
00:35:36,730 --> 00:35:40,030
BFF tooling is getting way better now so

835
00:35:40,030 --> 00:35:41,470
that's one we're doing you have to be a

836
00:35:41,470 --> 00:35:43,510
little bit careful and this is right a

837
00:35:43,510 --> 00:35:46,750
lot of people is that that will work but

838
00:35:46,750 --> 00:35:49,660
it'll tell you what sis cause it is

839
00:35:49,660 --> 00:35:52,360
using in your current environment and

840
00:35:52,360 --> 00:35:55,110
then the problem is if you change things

841
00:35:55,110 --> 00:36:00,280
if I change so for example there's been

842
00:36:00,280 --> 00:36:03,250
a bunch of cases where syscalls have

843
00:36:03,250 --> 00:36:05,620
changed quite a lot over the last five

844
00:36:05,620 --> 00:36:09,160
years there was the first one I think

845
00:36:09,160 --> 00:36:11,050
they're breaking a bunch of second

846
00:36:11,050 --> 00:36:15,130
profiles was when Lipsy changed from

847
00:36:15,130 --> 00:36:22,660
using open to open at open at was a open

848
00:36:22,660 --> 00:36:24,730
at was originally a sis : that added a

849
00:36:24,730 --> 00:36:27,730
directory thing to open but it also

850
00:36:27,730 --> 00:36:30,100
added more flags and it basically ever

851
00:36:30,100 --> 00:36:32,230
became the best way of the modern way of

852
00:36:32,230 --> 00:36:34,870
doing it and the open syscall was marked

853
00:36:34,870 --> 00:36:36,250
as kind of legacy and it was the

854
00:36:36,250 --> 00:36:39,700
cross-platform thing so that was where

855
00:36:39,700 --> 00:36:40,960
so all the Cisco's and they switch from

856
00:36:40,960 --> 00:36:42,760
open to open out and if you didn't have

857
00:36:42,760 --> 00:36:45,220
them both in your second policy when you

858
00:36:45,220 --> 00:36:47,170
did that upgrade all opens would fail

859
00:36:47,170 --> 00:36:49,480
that was kind of inconvenient we've had

860
00:36:49,480 --> 00:36:53,730
a few other cases now our 32-bit

861
00:36:53,730 --> 00:36:55,930
machines have had a bunch of breaking

862
00:36:55,930 --> 00:36:59,200
changes the most recent one is that the

863
00:36:59,200 --> 00:37:01,900
last Debian I think it's dead no was it

864
00:37:01,900 --> 00:37:04,360
Ubuntu oh I think is open to a 2004

865
00:37:04,360 --> 00:37:08,860
shipped with 64-bit time support on

866
00:37:08,860 --> 00:37:13,540
32-bit hosts to fix the the year 2038

867
00:37:13,540 --> 00:37:16,240
problem and that and so suddenly

868
00:37:16,240 --> 00:37:18,250
overnight if you upgraded

869
00:37:18,250 --> 00:37:20,890
your base container from to a buncee

870
00:37:20,890 --> 00:37:23,020
2004 it suddenly changed as calls it was

871
00:37:23,020 --> 00:37:24,490
using and again that broke people so you

872
00:37:24,490 --> 00:37:26,770
you need to be a bit careful that if you

873
00:37:26,770 --> 00:37:28,420
even have you changed the smallest thing

874
00:37:28,420 --> 00:37:31,450
you check you briefs you rescan what the

875
00:37:31,450 --> 00:37:33,910
syscalls you're using our but but yeah

876
00:37:33,910 --> 00:37:35,950
you can definitely do that mhm

877
00:37:35,950 --> 00:37:37,720
I think we got about one minute left or

878
00:37:37,720 --> 00:37:40,060
so I've got so one question of my own

879
00:37:40,060 --> 00:37:41,110
under there's another question here

880
00:37:41,110 --> 00:37:43,360
people see how it was here okay is this

881
00:37:43,360 --> 00:37:45,220
from like a cook on Liam Baker asks is

882
00:37:45,220 --> 00:37:48,030
there a six security slack channels yes

883
00:37:48,030 --> 00:37:52,870
six security on the CN CF slack cool

884
00:37:52,870 --> 00:37:55,120
cool although I think we're at time one

885
00:37:55,120 --> 00:37:56,530
question I have really liked to ask is

886
00:37:56,530 --> 00:37:58,240
in terms of like you know obviously

887
00:37:58,240 --> 00:38:01,060
you've been in hindsight hindsight is

888
00:38:01,060 --> 00:38:02,530
always 20/20 right we can look back and

889
00:38:02,530 --> 00:38:03,880
say we can say what's good and what's

890
00:38:03,880 --> 00:38:05,650
not but in terms of what we're learning

891
00:38:05,650 --> 00:38:07,810
in terms of the way you would go about

892
00:38:07,810 --> 00:38:10,000
making these decisions so for example if

893
00:38:10,000 --> 00:38:13,300
you was to be faced with the same kind

894
00:38:13,300 --> 00:38:15,550
of decisions obviously different

895
00:38:15,550 --> 00:38:18,100
different in terms of the actual answers

896
00:38:18,100 --> 00:38:20,170
but the same style of decisions what

897
00:38:20,170 --> 00:38:21,550
would be learning your approach that

898
00:38:21,550 --> 00:38:23,410
would make you more likely get to the

899
00:38:23,410 --> 00:38:26,020
right answer I mean it's difficult

900
00:38:26,020 --> 00:38:28,420
because the thing like the whole

901
00:38:28,420 --> 00:38:30,160
environment we're in has changed so much

902
00:38:30,160 --> 00:38:33,160
in five years so it's it's like and that

903
00:38:33,160 --> 00:38:34,660
there's so much innovation and that

904
00:38:34,660 --> 00:38:36,910
people are doing things very differently

905
00:38:36,910 --> 00:38:40,540
so that you you kind of got to be a bit

906
00:38:40,540 --> 00:38:43,690
flexible about things are not lock them

907
00:38:43,690 --> 00:38:46,450
in forever so the more the more kind of

908
00:38:46,450 --> 00:38:48,370
used a generic foundation for things

909
00:38:48,370 --> 00:38:50,920
like with notary v2 we're putting

910
00:38:50,920 --> 00:38:54,580
everything in the registry it's like you

911
00:38:54,580 --> 00:38:57,910
know the the model of having extensible

912
00:38:57,910 --> 00:38:59,980
new types of thing being able to be

913
00:38:59,980 --> 00:39:01,330
stored in the registry is something that

914
00:39:01,330 --> 00:39:03,400
a pattern that has started to be being

915
00:39:03,400 --> 00:39:05,260
used because it lets us evolve more

916
00:39:05,260 --> 00:39:06,880
things eat more easily over time rather

917
00:39:06,880 --> 00:39:08,980
than having a special service for

918
00:39:08,980 --> 00:39:10,600
signatures it's like let's put

919
00:39:10,600 --> 00:39:12,670
everything in the generic if we're in

920
00:39:12,670 --> 00:39:14,800
the generic thing because it's easier to

921
00:39:14,800 --> 00:39:18,760
evolve it so the more you think I'm

922
00:39:18,760 --> 00:39:20,290
probably gonna have to change this again

923
00:39:20,290 --> 00:39:22,210
and let's make it generic and general

924
00:39:22,210 --> 00:39:25,140
purpose and not too specific the better

925
00:39:25,140 --> 00:39:27,370
but it's difficult with security things

926
00:39:27,370 --> 00:39:31,880
as well because generic can mean in

927
00:39:31,880 --> 00:39:34,759
here six so you have to be rich I mean I

928
00:39:34,759 --> 00:39:36,230
think Security's hard so you have to be

929
00:39:36,230 --> 00:39:40,160
very careful yeah awesome thank you very

930
00:39:40,160 --> 00:39:42,049
much Justin and actually from a personal

931
00:39:42,049 --> 00:39:43,130
point of view I'm very much looking

932
00:39:43,130 --> 00:39:44,990
forward to the kind of snick docker

933
00:39:44,990 --> 00:39:47,750
collaboration as well to see how we can

934
00:39:47,750 --> 00:39:49,789
help push out push docker security

935
00:39:49,789 --> 00:39:51,049
forward as well so I'm really looking

936
00:39:51,049 --> 00:39:52,640
forward to that absolutely it's been

937
00:39:52,640 --> 00:39:53,480
great working with you

938
00:39:53,480 --> 00:39:55,549
it's been good excellent thank you very

939
00:39:55,549 --> 00:39:57,730
much
