individual instead of saying that

28

they're a patient or sick they just say

29
00:01:32,369 --> 00:01:35,659
consumer that's more friendly because

30
00:01:35,659 --> 00:01:38,280
everybody suffers from stress or some

31

82
00:04:09,520 --> 00:04:13,270
before my my back ache so that was added

83
00:04:13,270 --> 00:04:15,220
stress I was mad that she mentioned my

84
00:04:15,220 --> 00:04:17,470
name and I told the officers to arrest

85
00:04:17,470 --> 00:04:21,399
her she got arrested she cooperated with

86
00:04:21,399 --> 00:04:23,890
the officers and when she got bonded out

87
00:04:23,890 --> 00:04:25,750
two girls

88
00:04:25,750 --> 00:04:27,730
to her three girls came to her job place

89
00:04:27,730 --> 00:04:29,170
of employment drug her out and beat her

90
00:04:29,170 --> 00:04:32,230
senseless I then found out she was a

91
00:04:32,230 --> 00:04:34,450
victim of a sexual assault week a week

92
00:04:34,450 --> 00:04:37,210
prior man I felt like the worst man in

93
00:04:37,210 --> 00:04:39,580
the world first dad worst dad in the

94
00:04:39,580 --> 00:04:44,350
world and so the next day my back was

95
00:04:44,350 --> 00:04:46,390
hurting and I took the medication I went

96
00:04:46,390 --> 00:04:50,110
to bed and I still woke up I woke up for

97
00:04:50,110 --> 00:04:51,520
some reason didn't want to live

98
00:04:51,520 --> 00:04:53,200
something told me to just kill myself

99
00:04:53,200 --> 00:04:55,390
I've never had that feeling before I

100
00:04:55,390 --> 00:04:56,980
never thought that like I said life was

101
00:04:56,980 --> 00:04:59,590
good something told me to just kill

102
00:04:59,590 --> 00:05:00,220
myself

103
00:05:00,220 --> 00:05:02,980
and so I took the whole bottle of muscle

104
00:05:02,980 --> 00:05:05,730
relaxers I took the whole bottle of

105
00:05:05,730 --> 00:05:09,070
painkillers and my I wasn't dead yet so

106
00:05:09,070 --> 00:05:10,420
you know they say not to drink alcohol

107
00:05:10,420 --> 00:05:13,630
with prescription medication I did

108
00:05:13,630 --> 00:05:16,360
because I wanted to induce the death I

109
00:05:16,360 --> 00:05:18,730
wanted to hurry up and die that didn't

110
00:05:18,730 --> 00:05:21,700
work so I loaded up my 357 Magnum my

111
00:05:21,700 --> 00:05:23,830
off-duty weapon and I put it in my squad

112
00:05:23,830 --> 00:05:27,070
car I noticed I said squad car I was in

113
00:05:27,070 --> 00:05:28,750
my unmarked squad car

114
00:05:28,750 --> 00:05:32,310
I was so high from that medication I

115
00:05:32,310 --> 00:05:34,720
literally thought I was in my personal

116
00:05:34,720 --> 00:05:36,280
vehicle because to this day I can see

117
00:05:36,280 --> 00:05:38,820
myself pressing the button to my Jaguar

118
00:05:38,820 --> 00:05:41,979
sunroof so I can get air so I can stay

119
00:05:41,979 --> 00:05:44,229
awake to get to the park to kill myself

120
00:05:44,229 --> 00:05:46,360
I didn't want to kill myself at the

121
00:05:46,360 --> 00:05:47,440
house because I didn't want my wife

122
00:05:47,440 --> 00:05:52,050
finding me what happened after that was

123
00:05:52,050 --> 00:05:56,979
this a crazy story spiral are our vice

124
00:05:56,979 --> 00:06:00,040

125
00:06:00,040 --> 00:06:02,130

129
00:06:11,979 --> 00:06:15,760
tactics is what officers trained

130
00:06:15,760 --> 00:06:17,500
officers do they have eight hours of

131
00:06:17,500 --> 00:06:19,240
training and they go yearly to get

132
00:06:19,240 --> 00:06:21,520
recertified and they are with that

133
00:06:21,520 --> 00:06:23,310
training they are allowed to make

134
00:06:23,310 --> 00:06:26,740
psychological field examinations and if

135
00:06:26,740 --> 00:06:29,320

criminal activity if it's a misdemeanor

137
00:06:30,850 --> 00:06:33,550
or less then they don't take you to jail

138
00:06:33,550 --> 00:06:34,870
they don't arrest you they get you

139

00:07:36,240 --> 00:07:37,890
thought at the same time I was gonna get

169
00:07:37,890 --> 00:07:41,910
help the story is so long but that's

170
00:07:41,910 --> 00:07:43,920
basically why I'm devoted to talk about

171
00:07:43,920 --> 00:07:47,460
stress I learned that 70% of people with

172
00:07:47,460 --> 00:07:50,700
mental health issues really don't they

173
00:07:50,700 --> 00:07:51,690
don't need medication

174
00:07:51,690 --> 00:07:54,840
it's the 30% that really needed the

175
00:07:54,840 --> 00:07:56,520
people that suffer from schizophrenia

176
00:07:56,520 --> 00:07:59,970
and things serious mental illness those

177
00:07:59,970 --> 00:08:02,420
individuals need medication but a lot

178
00:08:02,420 --> 00:08:05,370
70% of the population of world

179
00:08:05,370 --> 00:08:08,010
population that are on some type of

180
00:08:08,010 --> 00:08:10,440
psychiatric medication they really don't

181
00:08:10,440 --> 00:08:23,690
need it and this is a story here okay

182
00:08:25,560 --> 00:08:28,210
so I just told you all this okay what

183
00:08:28,210 --> 00:08:29,520
we're going to talk about here is

184
00:08:29,520 --> 00:08:37,780
basically the dr.dre method it talks

185
00:08:37,780 --> 00:08:40,559
about downloading distress just

186
00:08:40,559 --> 00:08:43,030
rerouting the stress deleting the risk

187
00:08:43,030 --> 00:08:45,100
of the stress reboot the stress and

188
00:08:45,100 --> 00:08:46,600
encrypt the stress and we'll talk about

189
00:08:46,600 --> 00:08:51,070
that as we continue the pressure of

190
00:08:51,070 --> 00:08:52,120
working in the field of computer

191
00:08:52,120 --> 00:08:54,700
technology can be a dream for the

192
00:08:54,700 --> 00:08:56,500
observer for people outside looking in

193
00:08:56,500 --> 00:08:59,800
but to us for the people in the

194
00:08:59,800 --> 00:09:01,660
technology field it could be a nightmare

195
00:09:01,660 --> 00:09:04,900
I remember I was at a Dallas conference

196
00:09:04,900 --> 00:09:07,150
where I gave this lecture at Dallas and

197
00:09:07,150 --> 00:09:14,020
I was told I was told that a gentleman

198
00:09:14,020 --> 00:09:16,120
who was a developer had to change his

199
00:09:16,120 --> 00:09:18,730
job I think he had to go into coding or

200
00:09:18,730 --> 00:09:20,680
something like to that effect and he had

201
00:09:20,680 --> 00:09:24,310
been a developer for 15 years and the

202
00:09:24,310 --> 00:09:26,020
option was that his place of employment

203
00:09:26,020 --> 00:09:28,570
gave me hey either you learned this new

204
00:09:28,570 --> 00:09:30,040
position or you're fired

205
00:09:30,040 --> 00:09:33,490
and while I said that stress working as

206
00:09:33,490 --> 00:09:35,350
a developer specialist a designer

207
00:09:35,350 --> 00:09:38,800
engineer expert manager and technician

208
00:09:38,800 --> 00:09:40,870
demands a high level of precision you

209
00:09:40,870 --> 00:09:42,640
guys already know that over the extended

210
00:09:42,640 --> 00:09:46,150
period and any minute times lapse this

211
00:09:46,150 --> 00:09:52,930
could be disastrous these demands can

212
00:09:52,930 --> 00:09:54,730
cause an increase in blood pressure and

213
00:09:54,730 --> 00:09:57,100
adrenaline leading to stress and mental

214
00:09:57,100 --> 00:10:02,080
strain technicians and developers have a

215
00:10:02,080 --> 00:10:04,360
high level of psychological frustration

216
00:10:04,360 --> 00:10:08,380
during hours of work out those who work

217
00:10:08,380 --> 00:10:11,170
continuously work 50-plus hours a week

218
00:10:11,170 --> 00:10:13,600
these individuals most likely display

219
00:10:13,600 --> 00:10:15,100
signs of physical and emotional

220
00:10:15,100 --> 00:10:17,770
discomfort during their off hours they

221
00:10:17,770 --> 00:10:19,300
take it home with them ladies and

222
00:10:19,300 --> 00:10:24,430
gentlemen what they don't see the jobs

223
00:10:24,430 --> 00:10:26,620
could be tedious boring tasks high

224
00:10:26,620 --> 00:10:30,100
demands and work more work burden and an

225
00:10:30,100 --> 00:10:33,180
absence of control over the job itself

226
00:10:33,180 --> 00:10:36,250
for managerial interactions

227
00:10:36,250 --> 00:10:39,580
the defective technology fear of losing

228
00:10:39,580 --> 00:10:42,160
your job these remain the same

229
00:10:42,160 --> 00:10:44,290
occupation stressors that have been

230
00:10:44,290 --> 00:10:47,170
defined as problematic for a variety of

231
00:10:47,170 --> 00:10:49,300
professional occupations not just the

232
00:10:49,300 --> 00:10:51,400
technology field at least gentlemen

233
00:10:51,400 --> 00:10:54,540
here's an interesting stat a statistic

234
00:10:54,540 --> 00:10:58,390
the number one stress jobs in the United

235

sexual dysfunction and skin disease work

246
00:11:38,440 --> 00:11:40,600
pressure can be explained as a harmful

247
00:11:40,600 --> 00:11:43,630
physical and psychological reaction

248
00:11:43,630 --> 00:11:46,240
these arise when the demands of the

249
00:11:46,240 --> 00:11:48,910
career don't fit the capability means a

250

may result in illnesses and as also a

personal injury work-related stress

253
00:11:59,320 --> 00:12:00,970
happens to be one of the most

254
00:12:00,970 --> 00:12:03,220
significant health issues in modern work

255
00:12:03,220 --> 00:12:06,520
and modern society today work stress

256
00:12:06,520 --> 00:12:08,440
arises in the response of both the work

257
00:12:08,440 --> 00:12:12,390
environment and the work workers factors

258
00:12:12,390 --> 00:12:16,030
lifestyle factors used to just decrease

259
00:12:16,030 --> 00:12:18,970
stress utilizing one's social skills can

260
00:12:18,970 --> 00:12:23,580
help or improve any bicha lifestyle

261
00:12:24,420 --> 00:12:26,800
activities within the workplace there's

262
00:12:26,800 --> 00:12:28,840
things you can do build or use more

263
00:12:28,840 --> 00:12:32,770
often social media interactions I just

264
00:12:32,770 --> 00:12:34,300
started social I just started getting

265

hang of social media two years ago and

266
00:12:37,330 --> 00:12:40,300
I'd really instill having a tough time

267
00:12:40,300 --> 00:12:42,640
with Twitter but you don't have to

268

part of team dynamic dynamics I'm sorry

274
00:12:55,179 --> 00:12:57,999
get a work wife or a work husband this

275
00:12:57,999 --> 00:13:02,100
is this form of support system

276
00:13:02,189 --> 00:13:04,660
activities outside the workplace request

277
00:13:04,660 --> 00:13:05,980
that your company implementing a

278
00:13:05,980 --> 00:13:07,660
discounted rate to a fitness facility

279
00:13:07,660 --> 00:13:11,619
try walking or running and I know this

280
00:13:11,619 --> 00:13:14,499
is kind of hard to do with Kovac going

281
00:13:14,499 --> 00:13:16,329
on but Cole is not gonna be here forever

282
00:13:16,329 --> 00:13:18,279
I know that I pray about it every night

283
00:13:18,279 --> 00:13:21,730
that it goes away so I know I trust that

284
00:13:21,730 --> 00:13:23,949

285
00:13:23,949 --> 00:13:26,230
workplace pick up a hobby or if you have

286
00:13:26,230 --> 00:13:29,259

294
00:13:46,660 --> 00:13:49,449

there's nothing wrong with having a

298
00:13:55,959 --> 00:13:57,610
healthy discussion with your mind

299

301
00:14:03,339 --> 00:14:05,290
fast but usually I focus on my breathing

302
00:14:05,290 --> 00:14:08,559
and I visualized myself performing

303
00:14:08,559 --> 00:14:12,069
before I do self-awareness is once a

304
00:14:12,069 --> 00:14:14,889
once control if you're gonna say if you

305
00:14:14,889 --> 00:14:17,049
like visualize you can visualize

306
00:14:17,049 --> 00:14:19,119
anything that you do but if you're

307
00:14:19,119 --> 00:14:21,910
playing a game if you're walking or if

308
00:14:21,910 --> 00:14:23,439
you're running or if you're you're

309
00:14:23,439 --> 00:14:24,819
working are you going to work just

310
00:14:24,819 --> 00:14:27,040
visualize yourself doing that before you

311
00:14:27,040 --> 00:14:31,480
do it start with tedious tasks if you

312
00:14:31,480 --> 00:14:33,490
like if you have to do something silly

313
00:14:33,490 --> 00:14:34,839
is going to the restroom you have to go

314
00:14:34,839 --> 00:14:36,610
to the restroom visualize yourself go to

315
00:14:36,610 --> 00:14:38,649
the restroom and pretty soon you'll

316
00:14:38,649 --> 00:14:40,629
start to notice that you're visualizing

317
00:14:40,629 --> 00:14:43,149
yours doing things over and over again

318
00:14:43,149 --> 00:14:45,429

00:14:47,829 --> 00:14:50,019
something before you do it and it's like

321
00:14:50,019 --> 00:14:52,989

00:15:44,249 --> 00:15:46,290
bust a rap I was I was literally I was

334
00:15:46,290 --> 00:15:47,970
literally if the beat would have kept

335
00:15:47,970 --> 00:15:50,249
continuing I was literally about to rap

336
00:15:50,249 --> 00:15:51,689
this next post I was about to say

337
00:15:51,689 --> 00:15:54,059
download the cause of stress determine

338
00:15:54,059 --> 00:15:55,619
what it is ha ha ha ha

339
00:15:55,619 --> 00:15:58,079
that's my way of beatbox and see I told

340
00:15:58,079 --> 00:15:58,829
you be silly

341
00:15:58,829 --> 00:16:00,899
you know download the cause of your

342
00:16:00,899 --> 00:16:03,480
stress determine what is causing is

343
00:16:03,480 --> 00:16:05,490
downloading is you gotta find out what's

344
00:16:05,490 --> 00:16:07,559
causing the stress you can't ignore it

345
00:16:07,559 --> 00:16:10,199
you when you find out what it is the

346
00:16:10,199 --> 00:16:15,389
next step is to use the mental router to

347
00:16:15,389 --> 00:16:18,149
direct the stress that is secure sight

348
00:16:18,149 --> 00:16:20,519
in your mind if you can't ignore the

349
00:16:20,519 --> 00:16:22,920
stress find a place to route it to a

350
00:16:22,920 --> 00:16:25,980
location in your head where it is safe

351
00:16:25,980 --> 00:16:31,379
but it won't affect you learn to delete

352
00:16:31,379 --> 00:16:34,319
future stress elements it's up to you

353
00:16:34,319 --> 00:16:36,420
once you discover what is causing you

354
00:16:36,420 --> 00:16:39,449
the stress delete it by past using

355
00:16:39,449 --> 00:16:41,309
methods by past methods that you use

356
00:16:41,309 --> 00:16:43,290
which helped you conquer stress in the

357
00:16:43,290 --> 00:16:47,509
past if it ain't broke don't fix it

358
00:16:47,509 --> 00:16:49,980
reboot yourself and focus on the

359
00:16:49,980 --> 00:16:51,389
positive aspects

360
00:16:51,389 --> 00:16:53,819
it may seem futile however there are

361
00:16:53,819 --> 00:16:56,579
bright sides to negative situations

362
00:16:56,579 --> 00:16:58,589
focus on anything and I mean anything

363
00:16:58,589 --> 00:17:01,769
which has a positive outcome from that

364
00:17:01,769 --> 00:17:06,980
one stressful situation and finally

365
00:17:06,980 --> 00:17:10,230
encrypt your mind to a secure positive

366
00:17:10,230 --> 00:17:12,779
parts once you have learned the methods

367
00:17:12,779 --> 00:17:15,000
that you are that are positive to

368
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:16,929
alleviate stress lock them

369
00:17:16,929 --> 00:17:19,329
sure them in that mine heck even give it

370
00:17:19,329 --> 00:17:21,878
an a give it a method like a password

371
00:17:21,878 --> 00:17:24,688
give it a password

372
00:17:38,510 --> 00:17:41,130

374
00:17:43,800 --> 00:17:45,180

383
00:18:01,860 --> 00:18:07,920
questions we've got so so what it's

384
00:18:07,920 --> 00:18:09,300
gotta be just a different level setting

385
00:18:09,300 --> 00:18:11,400
right coming for coming from a really

386
00:18:11,400 --> 00:18:12,840
stressful environment where things are

387
00:18:12,840 --> 00:18:14,220
actually life and death and coming into

388
00:18:14,220 --> 00:18:18,090
this sort of tech world and it's got to

389
00:18:18,090 --> 00:18:19,680
be different to try to you know little

390
00:18:19,680 --> 00:18:22,560
bling take them super seriously relative

391
00:18:22,560 --> 00:18:25,200
year old your old environment yeah I it

392
00:18:25,200 --> 00:18:27,600

393
00:18:27,600 --> 00:18:30,960
like I said and I wish and I I'm glad

394
00:18:30,960 --> 00:18:32,580
you guys let me change the speech

395
00:18:32,580 --> 00:18:35,310
because uh the the what is social

396
00:18:35,310 --> 00:18:38,750
engineering I'm using uh interviews from

397
00:18:38,750 --> 00:18:41,430
hackers and former people that use

398
00:18:41,430 --> 00:18:43,950
social engineering that get inside

399
00:18:43,950 --> 00:18:45,750
companies and stuff like that and I

400
00:18:45,750 --> 00:18:47,490
didn't want that to be you know I'd

401
00:18:47,490 --> 00:18:49,110
rather do that in person so hopefully

402
00:18:49,110 --> 00:18:50,730
y'all bring me back make sure we do that

403
00:18:50,730 --> 00:18:52,380
in purpose person cuz it's kind of fun

404
00:18:52,380 --> 00:18:55,290
but I what were sixteen lectures and

405
00:18:55,290 --> 00:18:58,610
they're all mental health psychology

406
00:18:58,610 --> 00:19:04,560
behavioral analysis related so I'm you

407
00:19:04,560 --> 00:19:06,420
know I I kind of found my niche I kind

408
00:19:06,420 --> 00:19:08,820
of failed into this real easy it was

409
00:19:08,820 --> 00:19:10,700
just it was this great opportunity uh

410
00:19:10,700 --> 00:19:13,260
the tech community be honest with you

411
00:19:13,260 --> 00:19:14,300
the tech community

412
00:19:14,300 --> 00:19:17,280
really I love the tech community I've

413
00:19:17,280 --> 00:19:19,260
spoken 34 times last year and it's all

414
00:19:19,260 --> 00:19:21,480
been tech events and you know what I

415
00:19:21,480 --> 00:19:23,310
have not been asked to speak at a law

416
00:19:23,310 --> 00:19:24,960
enforcement event I have not been asked

417
00:19:24,960 --> 00:19:27,720
to speak at a middle healthy man but God

418
00:19:27,720 --> 00:19:29,280
will only hopefully I'll be speaking in

419
00:19:29,280 --> 00:19:31,950
March in Washington DC on the march of

420
00:19:31,950 --> 00:19:34,470

421
00:19:34,470 --> 00:19:37,010
hopefully I'll be speaking there okay

422
00:19:37,010 --> 00:19:39,060
what do you think it's like the one big

423
00:19:39,060 --> 00:19:40,950
tech takeaway for folks in techie I mean

424
00:19:40,950 --> 00:19:42,210
if you're dealing with stress right now

425
00:19:42,210 --> 00:19:44,370
in this environment some people are what

426
00:19:44,370 --> 00:19:45,420
do you think it like the one technique

427
00:19:45,420 --> 00:19:46,360
you just have to leave it with

428
00:19:46,360 --> 00:19:48,070
take away you know people could do as a

429
00:19:48,070 --> 00:19:50,920
practice okay and suppose and I think

430
00:19:50,920 --> 00:19:52,240
people a lot of people are still working

431
00:19:52,240 --> 00:19:55,870
from home again find something that you

432
00:19:55,870 --> 00:19:58,540
are funny find something that that just

433
00:19:58,540 --> 00:20:00,660
makes you laugh even like I said I

434
00:20:00,660 --> 00:20:02,920
wanted to go in further I didn't know my

435
00:20:02,920 --> 00:20:05,320
time slot but I I wanted to go in about

436
00:20:05,320 --> 00:20:09,430
the me gay like some people if you want

437
00:20:09,430 --> 00:20:12,550
to just binge while like I had a meet

438
00:20:12,550 --> 00:20:14,140

441
00:20:19,690 --> 00:20:22,480
seen it uh-huh I seen the each episode

442
00:20:22,480 --> 00:20:23,830
at least a hundred times each but I've

443
00:20:23,830 --> 00:20:27,040

444
00:20:27,040 --> 00:20:29,980
