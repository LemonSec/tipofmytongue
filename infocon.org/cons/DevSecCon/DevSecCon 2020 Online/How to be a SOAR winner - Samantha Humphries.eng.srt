1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:01,380
thank you thank you for having me

2
00:00:01,380 --> 00:00:07,350
alright so in the next half hour forty

3
00:00:07,350 --> 00:00:09,300
minutes this is what I will take you

4
00:00:09,300 --> 00:00:11,460
through so we'll get to know each other

5
00:00:11,460 --> 00:00:13,200
a little bit maybe slightly more

6
00:00:13,200 --> 00:00:15,030
difficult than if you were in person but

7
00:00:15,030 --> 00:00:16,940
like let's just pretend I'll be great

8
00:00:16,940 --> 00:00:19,470
we'll talk about what I said I was going

9
00:00:19,470 --> 00:00:21,300
to talk about so hopefully those

10
00:00:21,300 --> 00:00:23,550
promises will be fulfilled by the end of

11
00:00:23,550 --> 00:00:24,180
the talk

12
00:00:24,180 --> 00:00:28,349
a few fundamentals on so what is it why

13
00:00:28,349 --> 00:00:31,080
should you bother I do have a crazy

14
00:00:31,080 --> 00:00:33,829
theory even at this time on a Monday

15
00:00:33,829 --> 00:00:36,090
what you should also make updating your

16
00:00:36,090 --> 00:00:38,160
LinkedIn profile that could be a thing

17
00:00:38,160 --> 00:00:40,620
and everyone lots of measurements and

18
00:00:40,620 --> 00:00:42,480
then we'll have questions again great

19
00:00:42,480 --> 00:00:44,280
all right everyone sitting comfortably

20
00:00:44,280 --> 00:00:49,289
let's go so quick he's Sam so I've been

21
00:00:49,289 --> 00:00:50,910
exiting this slide has not been updated

22
00:00:50,910 --> 00:00:52,980
my jobs like he doesn't ask you at the

23
00:00:52,980 --> 00:00:55,170
strategist I've been there for just over

24
00:00:55,170 --> 00:00:57,210
a year but I've been doing security

25
00:00:57,210 --> 00:01:00,390
since since the beginning of time so I

26
00:01:00,390 --> 00:01:02,879
worked in support for a while I

27
00:01:02,879 --> 00:01:05,188
definitely done Incident Response for

28
00:01:05,188 --> 00:01:08,060
enough years to make me aged terribly I

29
00:01:08,060 --> 00:01:11,610
was like my job title was not chief

30
00:01:11,610 --> 00:01:13,890
apology officer strangely enough but I

31
00:01:13,890 --> 00:01:15,840
did spend a lot of time saying sorry to

32
00:01:15,840 --> 00:01:17,640
people but things that were nothing to

33
00:01:17,640 --> 00:01:19,710
do with me but you know it's good to

34
00:01:19,710 --> 00:01:21,960
have a full guy I think I don't product

35
00:01:21,960 --> 00:01:23,310
management I've done product marketing

36
00:01:23,310 --> 00:01:26,460
really like the cloud never file means

37
00:01:26,460 --> 00:01:28,409
that you like the cloud nothing strange

38
00:01:28,409 --> 00:01:31,409
or illegal should you require a DJ at

39
00:01:31,409 --> 00:01:33,450
any point I am available for weddings

I'm right there and if you'd love to

43
00:01:39,960 --> 00:01:42,720
chat about old-school malware oh yeah I

44
00:01:42,720 --> 00:01:43,560
can talk

45
00:01:43,560 --> 00:01:45,420
Conficker and sanity over beer quite

46
00:01:45,420 --> 00:01:48,750
happily right I take I talk too much

47
00:01:48,750 --> 00:01:50,340
I've dumped around in front of

48
00:01:50,340 --> 00:01:52,590
PowerPoint slides and if you'd like to

49
00:01:52,590 --> 00:01:54,659
come say hi on Twitter and you can find

50
00:01:54,659 --> 00:01:59,880
me at safe sex with NCS okay let's

51
00:01:59,880 --> 00:02:01,710
pretend that I can see you if you could

52
00:02:01,710 --> 00:02:04,409
just say your name what you do tell me

53
00:02:04,409 --> 00:02:07,530
about yourself a little bit cool nice to

54
00:02:07,530 --> 00:02:10,378
meet you that was great thank you okay

55
00:02:10,378 --> 00:02:11,910
what are we going to talk about today

56
00:02:11,910 --> 00:02:14,310
what are we not going to talk about

57
00:02:14,310 --> 00:02:16,170
these things all come up if you google

58
00:02:16,170 --> 00:02:20,069
saw maybe if you can't spell I have no

59
00:02:20,069 --> 00:02:22,049
idea when that came up and this is a

60
00:02:22,049 --> 00:02:24,450
complete mystery about these things all

61
00:02:24,450 --> 00:02:26,519
available through the awesome power of

62
00:02:26,519 --> 00:02:28,290
Google and other search engines are

63
00:02:28,290 --> 00:02:31,379
available here's what we are going to

64
00:02:31,379 --> 00:02:34,109
talk about so what is saw how it can

65
00:02:34,109 --> 00:02:36,540
help you how you can think about

66
00:02:36,540 --> 00:02:39,689
approaching saw what you should automate

67
00:02:39,689 --> 00:02:41,730
what you shouldn't automate and then how

68
00:02:41,730 --> 00:02:45,659
to measure success I do work for a

69
00:02:45,659 --> 00:02:47,609
company that sells a sort product we're

70
00:02:47,609 --> 00:02:48,720
not going to talk about it you're not

71
00:02:48,720 --> 00:02:51,379
going to see it want to talk about it

72
00:02:51,379 --> 00:02:54,209
there's loads of stuff on there this is

73
00:02:54,209 --> 00:02:55,859
more really thinking about soars of

74
00:02:55,859 --> 00:02:58,349
process and the ways of doing it so

75
00:02:58,349 --> 00:03:03,000
let's talk about what sort is so sore

76
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:04,920
stands for security orchestration

77
00:03:04,920 --> 00:03:07,859
automation and response and I imagine

78
00:03:07,859 --> 00:03:10,470
given that the dev Sec part of the the

79
00:03:10,470 --> 00:03:12,810
conference name automation isn't exactly

80
00:03:12,810 --> 00:03:15,900
new in dev it's not really that new to

81
00:03:15,900 --> 00:03:17,430
security either it's been around a while

82
00:03:17,430 --> 00:03:20,549
and there were loads of lovely waves of

83
00:03:20,549 --> 00:03:22,319
automating things I mean half my

84
00:03:22,319 --> 00:03:26,449
hilarious automate it out of office but

85
00:03:26,449 --> 00:03:28,650
automating tasks really is because

86
00:03:28,650 --> 00:03:32,760
computers that said in security we often

87
00:03:32,760 --> 00:03:35,340
are still doing things manually which is

88
00:03:35,340 --> 00:03:38,120
just a bit weird sometimes I think that

89
00:03:38,120 --> 00:03:39,989
there could be lots of reasons for that

90
00:03:39,989 --> 00:03:42,780
trust me can be a challenge and if

91
00:03:42,780 --> 00:03:44,190
computers are going to screw things up

92
00:03:44,190 --> 00:03:45,060
they'll do it quickly

93
00:03:45,060 --> 00:03:48,120
that's something I've said sorry for a

94
00:03:48,120 --> 00:03:51,090
lot so getting getting this right and

95
00:03:51,090 --> 00:03:53,760
understanding kind of where to start not

96
00:03:53,760 --> 00:03:56,579
trying to literally boil the ocean or

97
00:03:56,579 --> 00:03:58,979
indeed automate the ocean is is a good

98
00:03:58,979 --> 00:04:00,479
thing so there are some good candidates

99
00:04:00,479 --> 00:04:02,790
than some things that are maybe best

100
00:04:02,790 --> 00:04:07,139
left for humans it turns out so lovely

101
00:04:07,139 --> 00:04:08,909
friends at the Gartner this is I've got

102
00:04:08,909 --> 00:04:11,250
their acquaintance or give you a second

103
00:04:11,250 --> 00:04:15,449
to read this fantastic description but

104
00:04:15,449 --> 00:04:17,339
ultimately it's about bringing the

105
00:04:17,339 --> 00:04:19,608
pieces together within your your toolset

106
00:04:19,608 --> 00:04:21,988
getting rid of that low-hanging fruit

107
00:04:21,988 --> 00:04:24,930
and then understanding where humans fit

108
00:04:24,930 --> 00:04:26,440
into that automation price

109
00:04:26,440 --> 00:04:29,350
because it's not a good idea to go in

110
00:04:29,350 --> 00:04:30,700
order to make everything you do in

111
00:04:30,700 --> 00:04:32,350
security operations from start to finish

112
00:04:32,350 --> 00:04:36,510
because things will and can be wrong

113
00:04:36,540 --> 00:04:39,640
when people think about saw there's kind

114
00:04:39,640 --> 00:04:41,620
of two real areas that kind of come up

115
00:04:41,620 --> 00:04:43,210
when we're talking to organizations this

116
00:04:43,210 --> 00:04:44,770
is kind of the first thing people talk

117
00:04:44,770 --> 00:04:48,820
about playbooks and then having some

118
00:04:48,820 --> 00:04:51,070
workflows you can have playbooks and

119
00:04:51,070 --> 00:04:53,380
workflows without touching saw

120
00:04:53,380 --> 00:04:55,090
whatsoever they can be completely human

121
00:04:55,090 --> 00:04:58,000
operated but generally these things take

122
00:04:58,000 --> 00:04:58,690
time

123
00:04:58,690 --> 00:05:01,960
and time is not your friend in security

124
00:05:01,960 --> 00:05:03,750
operations

125
00:05:03,750 --> 00:05:06,700
so hopefully you kind of got a bit of

126
00:05:06,700 --> 00:05:09,130
what soar is so you've got automating

127
00:05:09,130 --> 00:05:11,530
kind of the things that happen and then

128
00:05:11,530 --> 00:05:13,210
orchestrating we're bringing different

129
00:05:13,210 --> 00:05:15,370
tools together to perform some of those

130
00:05:15,370 --> 00:05:21,010
tasks and that's great but so up should

131
00:05:21,010 --> 00:05:24,690
you bother is the first question I think

132
00:05:24,690 --> 00:05:27,850
computers can do things very quickly and

133
00:05:27,850 --> 00:05:30,640
if you haven't set things up properly

134
00:05:30,640 --> 00:05:32,860
they'll do what you told them to do and

135
00:05:32,860 --> 00:05:36,160
that can be bad or you know it might not

136
00:05:36,160 --> 00:05:38,380
work so it may not be that they cause a

137
00:05:38,380 --> 00:05:40,150
huge issue but then we might have to

138
00:05:40,150 --> 00:05:41,740
something that's broken and not

139
00:05:41,740 --> 00:05:43,930
performing well and if you're expecting

140
00:05:43,930 --> 00:05:46,480
it to happen and it doesn't that can

141
00:05:46,480 --> 00:05:48,630
have a whole host of knock-on effects

142
00:05:48,630 --> 00:05:51,190
there is definitely concern if we do

143
00:05:51,190 --> 00:05:52,630
loads of automation does that mean we'll

144
00:05:52,630 --> 00:05:53,800
actually have a job at the end of it

145
00:05:53,800 --> 00:05:56,230
especially if you are saying working in

146
00:05:56,230 --> 00:05:58,570
a Security Operations Center just

147
00:05:58,570 --> 00:06:01,300
getting started in a tier-one kind of

148
00:06:01,300 --> 00:06:03,220
function does that mean my job's going

149
00:06:03,220 --> 00:06:06,790
away that's a real concern right and if

150
00:06:06,790 --> 00:06:10,570
you're kind of hiring people or you know

151
00:06:10,570 --> 00:06:11,770
you're in the leadership position

152
00:06:11,770 --> 00:06:13,419
somewhere does that mean then that

153
00:06:13,419 --> 00:06:15,820
people become more expensive do you only

154
00:06:15,820 --> 00:06:19,390
need seasoned analysts and we can talk

155
00:06:19,390 --> 00:06:21,430
skills gap all day long but certainly

156
00:06:21,430 --> 00:06:23,530
there are fewer seasoned analysts and

157
00:06:23,530 --> 00:06:24,850
there are junior analysts coming through

158
00:06:24,850 --> 00:06:28,419
what happens to my junior people how

159
00:06:28,419 --> 00:06:29,980
would I attract their track new talent

160
00:06:29,980 --> 00:06:31,450
so I have to describe for these people

161
00:06:31,450 --> 00:06:32,830
who've been doing it for years and years

162
00:06:32,830 --> 00:06:34,330
and years and years what I have been

163
00:06:34,330 --> 00:06:35,860
sort of folks coming up from university

164
00:06:35,860 --> 00:06:37,479
that are smart and keen and know others

165
00:06:37,479 --> 00:06:40,450
new stuff what do we do with those guys

166
00:06:40,450 --> 00:06:43,030
and then really it just becomes a bit

167
00:06:43,030 --> 00:06:47,800
too much right so we can just automate

168
00:06:47,800 --> 00:06:49,440
anything so where do I start

169
00:06:49,440 --> 00:06:52,270
and then it just you know what should we

170
00:06:52,270 --> 00:06:53,920
just not bother thank you very much

171
00:06:53,920 --> 00:06:55,930
that's been my talk no we should bother

172
00:06:55,930 --> 00:07:01,210
let's talk about why so these are some

173
00:07:01,210 --> 00:07:03,280
good questions to start with as you're

174
00:07:03,280 --> 00:07:06,310
approaching some sort of saw process and

175
00:07:06,310 --> 00:07:07,750
thinking about what to automate within

176
00:07:07,750 --> 00:07:10,750
security operations so you might have

177
00:07:10,750 --> 00:07:12,730
folks currently who are not super

178
00:07:12,730 --> 00:07:14,890
skilled but they're not spending time on

179
00:07:14,890 --> 00:07:17,080
tasks that are kind of worthy of their

180
00:07:17,080 --> 00:07:19,660
skillset especially if they're doing a

181
00:07:19,660 --> 00:07:21,700
lot of manual processes if you don't

182
00:07:21,700 --> 00:07:23,500
necessarily have a tiered system where

183
00:07:23,500 --> 00:07:24,910
you've got different people on different

184
00:07:24,910 --> 00:07:28,750
tasks with an escalation process you

185
00:07:28,750 --> 00:07:30,550
might have folks who were loads of

186
00:07:30,550 --> 00:07:32,260
experience and they're still spending

187
00:07:32,260 --> 00:07:35,950
time doing a lot of manual querying lots

188
00:07:35,950 --> 00:07:39,010
of manual investigations running running

189
00:07:39,010 --> 00:07:42,160
malware and it's all it takes time when

190
00:07:42,160 --> 00:07:43,930
you manual is generally bad when you're

191
00:07:43,930 --> 00:07:48,190
up against a clock alerts are definitely

192
00:07:48,190 --> 00:07:50,440
a challenge sims are brilliant

193
00:07:50,440 --> 00:07:53,980
kind of security products have been

194
00:07:53,980 --> 00:07:56,020
sending alerts in security products it's

195
00:07:56,020 --> 00:07:57,490
very easy to get a lot of stuff coming

196
00:07:57,490 --> 00:07:58,900
in from all over the place without

197
00:07:58,900 --> 00:08:01,720
having real context and knowing what to

198
00:08:01,720 --> 00:08:05,770
do first security technology does create

199
00:08:05,770 --> 00:08:08,380
false positives refer you back to my

200
00:08:08,380 --> 00:08:11,140
chief of policy officer whom I didn't

201
00:08:11,140 --> 00:08:13,120
revile and so I thought that I have so

202
00:08:13,120 --> 00:08:15,190
you know if you you're using software

203
00:08:15,190 --> 00:08:17,380
that's the bad stuff sometimes it gets

204
00:08:17,380 --> 00:08:21,520
it wrong and we did some research into

205
00:08:21,520 --> 00:08:23,350
the while ago that security operations

206
00:08:23,350 --> 00:08:25,200
teams are telling us that they are

207
00:08:25,200 --> 00:08:27,970
spending around about 25 percent at that

208
00:08:27,970 --> 00:08:31,750
time just on false positives that's a

209
00:08:31,750 --> 00:08:33,309
lot of time you know you want to go

210
00:08:33,309 --> 00:08:34,750
weapon security you want to do some cool

211
00:08:34,750 --> 00:08:36,940
stuff chasing ghosts is not called

212
00:08:36,940 --> 00:08:38,409
chasing case is boring and the

213
00:08:38,409 --> 00:08:41,590
moralizing and ultimately and stuff that

214
00:08:41,590 --> 00:08:43,450
really you know you could be doing

215
00:08:43,450 --> 00:08:46,810
something more interesting is there a

216
00:08:46,810 --> 00:08:48,400
bunch of work we aren't getting to I

217
00:08:48,400 --> 00:08:50,260
think that's a fairly obvious one I

218
00:08:50,260 --> 00:08:51,580
don't know anyone who works in a sec

219
00:08:51,580 --> 00:08:53,840
opsi things Wow really don't

220
00:08:53,840 --> 00:08:56,810
anything to do today hmm I should go and

221
00:08:56,810 --> 00:09:00,830
find something it's busy right training

222
00:09:00,830 --> 00:09:03,530
can be a real challenge as well again

223
00:09:03,530 --> 00:09:05,150
more research we actually got some

224
00:09:05,150 --> 00:09:08,780
research coming out yeah it's this is

225
00:09:08,780 --> 00:09:11,350
something that comes up repeatedly in

226
00:09:11,350 --> 00:09:14,900
security it seems we we work in an

227
00:09:14,900 --> 00:09:17,600
industry where it's it's a given that

228
00:09:17,600 --> 00:09:20,710
you spend your own time learning and

229
00:09:20,710 --> 00:09:22,760
it's less likely you're going to get

230
00:09:22,760 --> 00:09:24,250
learning time within the office

231
00:09:24,250 --> 00:09:26,630
especially if you work in an operational

232
00:09:26,630 --> 00:09:28,880
role you know where you are literally

233
00:09:28,880 --> 00:09:30,850
churning through stuff all day long

234
00:09:30,850 --> 00:09:33,440
taking time out to do formal training

235
00:09:33,440 --> 00:09:37,400
can be really painful so no Kenneth it's

236
00:09:37,400 --> 00:09:39,050
you can see working in a Security

237
00:09:39,050 --> 00:09:40,700
Operations role if you're a manager of

238
00:09:40,700 --> 00:09:42,340
that sort of team if you're a leader in

239
00:09:42,340 --> 00:09:45,500
insecurity will you do you think about

240
00:09:45,500 --> 00:09:47,450
like how often you training people or is

241
00:09:47,450 --> 00:09:48,830
it like you think oh yeah they can go to

242
00:09:48,830 --> 00:09:50,600
conferences on weekends or in the

243
00:09:50,600 --> 00:09:52,730
evening or those fun things they can

244
00:09:52,730 --> 00:09:56,180
learn in their own time and again that's

245
00:09:56,180 --> 00:09:57,710
not necessarily a great commitment to

246
00:09:57,710 --> 00:09:59,960
your folks but it's hard to do if you

247
00:09:59,960 --> 00:10:01,690
are working in a busy operations thing

248
00:10:01,690 --> 00:10:04,910
and then then a slightly random number

249
00:10:04,910 --> 00:10:06,920
but if you were around on the break you

250
00:10:06,920 --> 00:10:09,260
will have seen Trend Micro as well as

251
00:10:09,260 --> 00:10:11,510
sponsors my lovely friend Rick Ferguson

252
00:10:11,510 --> 00:10:13,760
avorite trend I caught one of his talks

253
00:10:13,760 --> 00:10:17,000
last year he was saying that they've

254
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:19,730
done some number crunching and if you

255
00:10:19,730 --> 00:10:21,470
had about a hundred thousand alerts

256
00:10:21,470 --> 00:10:23,060
coming every day which is kind of

257
00:10:23,060 --> 00:10:25,460
standard for like a large blanket swipe

258
00:10:25,460 --> 00:10:27,800
soft so not not all of our security

259
00:10:27,800 --> 00:10:30,260
operation centers may be like that but

260
00:10:30,260 --> 00:10:32,180
to handle that level of alerts coming

261
00:10:32,180 --> 00:10:36,620
through you'd need 217 analysts and I

262
00:10:36,620 --> 00:10:39,740
can probably count on a hand

263
00:10:39,740 --> 00:10:43,190
how many without the outsource MSP is

264
00:10:43,190 --> 00:10:44,600
how many actually in-house security

265
00:10:44,600 --> 00:10:49,010
operations teams have 217 analysts or

266
00:10:49,010 --> 00:10:52,670
even 250 or 260 it emanates much smaller

267
00:10:52,670 --> 00:10:55,850
operations so if you can answer these

268
00:10:55,850 --> 00:10:58,550
questions chances are you've got a

269
00:10:58,550 --> 00:11:01,700
requirement for security automation

270
00:11:01,700 --> 00:11:05,110
orchestration and response

271
00:11:05,280 --> 00:11:07,440
okay so here is really why you should

272
00:11:07,440 --> 00:11:08,700
bother them there are load of good

273
00:11:08,700 --> 00:11:11,190
reasons for doing this operational

274
00:11:11,190 --> 00:11:12,390
efficiency it's cool

275
00:11:12,390 --> 00:11:14,910
accuracy is cool take that with a caveat

276
00:11:14,910 --> 00:11:19,069
first though second

277
00:11:25,560 --> 00:11:30,640
there we go all right so yes efficiency

278
00:11:30,640 --> 00:11:32,310
and accuracy we like those things

279
00:11:32,310 --> 00:11:34,600
reducing risk and security you think if

280
00:11:34,600 --> 00:11:36,940
you're given that with manual tasks

281
00:11:36,940 --> 00:11:39,130
comes comes risk especially if you're

282
00:11:39,130 --> 00:11:40,810
doing the same thing over and over again

283
00:11:40,810 --> 00:11:44,560
I used to work in a team at a large

284
00:11:44,560 --> 00:11:49,510
vendor who has a the original founder

285
00:11:49,510 --> 00:11:50,770
doesn't work there anymore and his

286
00:11:50,770 --> 00:11:52,600
surname is the name of that company so

287
00:11:52,600 --> 00:11:53,980
I'll leave that with you as to where you

288
00:11:53,980 --> 00:11:55,740
think that is

289
00:11:55,740 --> 00:11:58,210
one of the processes that we had that

290
00:11:58,210 --> 00:12:00,640
was a very daily event took thousand

291
00:12:00,640 --> 00:12:03,640
mouse clicks from humans and if you

292
00:12:03,640 --> 00:12:04,870
think you're doing a thousand mouse

293
00:12:04,870 --> 00:12:08,020
clicks every day it's very possible that

294
00:12:08,020 --> 00:12:09,400
you may think you've done that mouse

295
00:12:09,400 --> 00:12:10,780
click today and actually you haven't

296
00:12:10,780 --> 00:12:12,250
because you've done it every day

297
00:12:12,250 --> 00:12:15,430
previously it's a big benefit behind saw

298
00:12:15,430 --> 00:12:17,080
is where you're getting rid of those

299
00:12:17,080 --> 00:12:18,700
manual tasks you're getting rid of that

300
00:12:18,700 --> 00:12:23,020
human ability to also get maybe you're

301
00:12:23,020 --> 00:12:24,300
right

302
00:12:24,300 --> 00:12:26,380
you could also get more value from the

303
00:12:26,380 --> 00:12:28,630
securities back linking security tools

304
00:12:28,630 --> 00:12:30,250
together is a good thing generate as

305
00:12:30,250 --> 00:12:31,680
long as they talk to each other properly

306
00:12:31,680 --> 00:12:35,440
but being able to to use them as kind of

307
00:12:35,440 --> 00:12:36,700
part of the whole rather than just

308
00:12:36,700 --> 00:12:38,110
having them sat there as individual

309
00:12:38,110 --> 00:12:42,040
Islands you get more funky and really

310
00:12:42,040 --> 00:12:43,120
what this all boils down to is

311
00:12:43,120 --> 00:12:45,760
eliminating wasted time and time is

312
00:12:45,760 --> 00:12:47,800
probably the most valuable commodity in

313
00:12:47,800 --> 00:12:49,210
security operations

314
00:12:49,210 --> 00:12:59,950
ah John McAfee nice to see you say

315
00:12:59,950 --> 00:13:02,140
here's my mad theory and having John

316
00:13:02,140 --> 00:13:04,540
McAfee wrapped in tin foil is possibly

317
00:13:04,540 --> 00:13:09,430
related a slightly madcap I see having

318
00:13:09,430 --> 00:13:13,120
this in place as an HR benefit and some

319
00:13:13,120 --> 00:13:14,650
of the reasons on one of the previous

320
00:13:14,650 --> 00:13:16,330
slides around things like training and

321
00:13:16,330 --> 00:13:20,830
interesting work or why that is not

322
00:13:20,830 --> 00:13:22,930
having enough interesting work to do is

323
00:13:22,930 --> 00:13:25,300
what in the top reasons for employees

324
00:13:25,300 --> 00:13:27,850
leaving a company in security and it

325
00:13:27,850 --> 00:13:29,370
seems obvious right you know we're

326
00:13:29,370 --> 00:13:31,660
people who want to do smart stuff with

327
00:13:31,660 --> 00:13:33,280
what people get into security for a

328
00:13:33,280 --> 00:13:35,620
whole host of reasons but you know when

329
00:13:35,620 --> 00:13:37,600
things are really bossing up you think

330
00:13:37,600 --> 00:13:38,860
you've got something

331
00:13:38,860 --> 00:13:41,080
potentially bad going on you're doing

332
00:13:41,080 --> 00:13:42,400
kratsov work you're finding things

333
00:13:42,400 --> 00:13:44,560
before they become a problem that's none

334
00:13:44,560 --> 00:13:46,360
of the cool stuff sitting there chatting

335
00:13:46,360 --> 00:13:48,010
through phishing emails trying to work

336
00:13:48,010 --> 00:13:50,170
out if a links good or bad that can be

337
00:13:50,170 --> 00:13:52,810
sold stirring so there is without doubt

338
00:13:52,810 --> 00:13:56,470
an HR benefit to doing this and also

339
00:13:56,470 --> 00:13:58,210
notice what is it being better for your

340
00:13:58,210 --> 00:14:01,870
people from a doing more interesting

341
00:14:01,870 --> 00:14:03,760
work point of view there's also the

342
00:14:03,760 --> 00:14:06,790
benefit of bone out there's a real thing

343
00:14:06,790 --> 00:14:09,580
in security right and if people are

344
00:14:09,580 --> 00:14:12,780
doing manual work on wasting time

345
00:14:12,780 --> 00:14:16,480
burnout can be very very easy so lots of

346
00:14:16,480 --> 00:14:18,700
good reasons beyond you know we've got

347
00:14:18,700 --> 00:14:22,630
computers and they should help us so

348
00:14:22,630 --> 00:14:24,160
some research mechs have been the new

349
00:14:24,160 --> 00:14:26,170
version of this is about to come out say

350
00:14:26,170 --> 00:14:28,660
I can't get the new numbers yet but stay

351
00:14:28,660 --> 00:14:31,780
tuned it's this week but some of these

352
00:14:31,780 --> 00:14:34,240
things won't be that surprising most

353
00:14:34,240 --> 00:14:36,970
security operations teams have some

354
00:14:36,970 --> 00:14:39,820
challenge around staffing 38 so-called

355
00:14:39,820 --> 00:14:42,450
out they were understaffed last year and

356
00:14:42,450 --> 00:14:45,580
of the unless that we spoke to 42% said

357
00:14:45,580 --> 00:14:46,840
challenging work is a reason that they

358
00:14:46,840 --> 00:14:50,320
stay that's pretty high right on the

359
00:14:50,320 --> 00:14:52,870
leadership end of the scale certainly at

360
00:14:52,870 --> 00:14:54,340
the c-suite people are concerned about

361
00:14:54,340 --> 00:14:57,700
staff inexperience and if you happen to

362
00:14:57,700 --> 00:14:59,140
be in America and you're still awake at

363
00:14:59,140 --> 00:15:02,140
this time great Sunday night if you

364
00:15:02,140 --> 00:15:04,590
enjoyed that Monday morning experience

365
00:15:04,590 --> 00:15:07,930
but training still aren't as regular

366
00:15:07,930 --> 00:15:10,570
certainly where I am here in the UK to

367
00:15:10,570 --> 00:15:13,450
have even quarterly training is is

368
00:15:13,450 --> 00:15:16,630
pretty unlikely so again it's expected

369
00:15:16,630 --> 00:15:18,280
that we go we learn in their own time as

370
00:15:18,280 --> 00:15:20,260
opposed to getting training relevant to

371
00:15:20,260 --> 00:15:22,630
our job during the hours that were being

372
00:15:22,630 --> 00:15:28,960
paid so some third-party research in

373
00:15:28,960 --> 00:15:30,280
case you think I've made it up because X

374
00:15:30,280 --> 00:15:33,580
beam so again training has become an

375
00:15:33,580 --> 00:15:35,260
issue this is a great report it's quite

376
00:15:35,260 --> 00:15:37,570
long I see there must be a way that we

377
00:15:37,570 --> 00:15:38,950
can get this across to you or you can

378
00:15:38,950 --> 00:15:41,680
quickly scroll down that URL but a life

379
00:15:41,680 --> 00:15:43,680
in terms of cybersecurity professionals

380
00:15:43,680 --> 00:15:46,360
goes into a lot of detail on a lot of

381
00:15:46,360 --> 00:15:48,910
subjects but some of the interesting

382
00:15:48,910 --> 00:15:51,130
bullet points related to this training

383
00:15:51,130 --> 00:15:52,510
the right level of training is not

384
00:15:52,510 --> 00:15:54,100
being provided by the employer having to

385
00:15:54,100 --> 00:15:56,950
do stuff in their own time more than

386
00:15:56,950 --> 00:15:58,450
that people don't have enough time to do

387
00:15:58,450 --> 00:16:00,390
any training anyway if it was available

388
00:16:00,390 --> 00:16:04,360
and as far as the the thought process on

389
00:16:04,360 --> 00:16:07,240
security automation pretty much

390
00:16:07,240 --> 00:16:10,120
everybody I mean not the 22 so we like

391
00:16:10,120 --> 00:16:13,530
the 78% there are friends
