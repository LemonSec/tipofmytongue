1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,419
hi ray I think you might be on mute

2
00:00:03,419 --> 00:00:08,370
still yes sir hey can you hear me yeah

3
00:00:08,370 --> 00:00:10,230
hey I'm looking forward to the session

4
00:00:10,230 --> 00:00:11,820
thanks for joining us here at DEP SEC on

5
00:00:11,820 --> 00:00:13,679
24 I think you're bringing a really

6
00:00:13,679 --> 00:00:15,509
unique perspective having come from from

7
00:00:15,509 --> 00:00:16,859
a dev world and just recently jumped

8
00:00:16,859 --> 00:00:19,560
over to the security function so yeah

9
00:00:19,560 --> 00:00:21,510
it's been fun the transition has been

10
00:00:21,510 --> 00:00:23,430
challenging but definitely worthwhile

11
00:00:23,430 --> 00:00:25,800
there's so much goodness in the security

12
00:00:25,800 --> 00:00:27,240
landscape things that we have to

13
00:00:27,240 --> 00:00:29,220
consider things that we take for granted

14
00:00:29,220 --> 00:00:31,019
which is the big thing I've discovered

15
00:00:31,019 --> 00:00:34,500
by as guilty as everybody and so when

16
00:00:34,500 --> 00:00:35,730
you get into a secure world you start

17
00:00:35,730 --> 00:00:39,210
realizing wow I'm I'm really not doing

18
00:00:39,210 --> 00:00:41,700
what I need to do to protect those

19
00:00:41,700 --> 00:00:43,620
endpoints so I learned a lot hopefully I

20
00:00:43,620 --> 00:00:46,079
can share some of that experience and

21
00:00:46,079 --> 00:00:48,180
motivate some folks to either think

22
00:00:48,180 --> 00:00:50,280
about security within the context of

23
00:00:50,280 --> 00:00:52,469
their development or maybe even get them

24
00:00:52,469 --> 00:00:54,000
to transition wholesale it to the

25
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:56,340
security world very cool very cool well

26
00:00:56,340 --> 00:00:57,480
I'm gonna let you jump into your session

27
00:00:57,480 --> 00:01:00,270
here and uh you later great great

28
00:01:00,270 --> 00:01:02,370
so good morning good afternoon good

29
00:01:02,370 --> 00:01:05,119
evening this my name is Ray mango and

30
00:01:05,119 --> 00:01:08,670
we'll talk about my transition from the

31
00:01:08,670 --> 00:01:11,460
world of web development over to the

32
00:01:11,460 --> 00:01:13,439
world of cyber security and as you can

33
00:01:13,439 --> 00:01:16,770
imagine the transition it's it's kind of

34
00:01:16,770 --> 00:01:19,080
wild it's kind of crazy what

35
00:01:19,080 --> 00:01:21,450
in addition I I find this whole virtual

36
00:01:21,450 --> 00:01:24,659
thing so interesting the ability to be

37
00:01:24,659 --> 00:01:26,189
you to have a conference presentation

38
00:01:26,189 --> 00:01:29,490
and view to share ideas with a massive

39
00:01:29,490 --> 00:01:31,950
group of people and but if you notice I

40
00:01:31,950 --> 00:01:33,479
have to have a background because if not

41
00:01:33,479 --> 00:01:35,250
my family will be walking back and forth

42
00:01:35,250 --> 00:01:37,860
and it definitely be an interesting

43
00:01:37,860 --> 00:01:40,320
presentation but you know I'm definitely

44
00:01:40,320 --> 00:01:42,180
excited about being here I'm definitely

45
00:01:42,180 --> 00:01:44,579
excited about talking about this for

46
00:01:44,579 --> 00:01:46,619
those who don't know I work for what

47
00:01:46,619 --> 00:01:48,420
used to be called the Death Star also

48
00:01:48,420 --> 00:01:51,869
known as Microsoft so Microsoft is it's

49
00:01:51,869 --> 00:01:53,490
definitely changed quite a bit from what

50
00:01:53,490 --> 00:01:55,200
I think a lot of people have produced to

51
00:01:55,200 --> 00:01:57,360
perceive it as there's been a dramatic

52
00:01:57,360 --> 00:01:59,189
change in the way that Microsoft thinks

53
00:01:59,189 --> 00:02:00,930
about technology about developers and

54
00:02:00,930 --> 00:02:02,369
the first about security and so

55
00:02:02,369 --> 00:02:05,280
Microsoft is a very very good security

56
00:02:05,280 --> 00:02:07,200
company there's a lot of efforts

57
00:02:07,200 --> 00:02:09,660
internally to obviously protect our

58
00:02:09,660 --> 00:02:10,979
products but also to make sure that

59
00:02:10,979 --> 00:02:11,950
customer

60
00:02:11,950 --> 00:02:14,260
of Microsoft products and just people in

61
00:02:14,260 --> 00:02:16,660
general have secure experience and so we

62
00:02:16,660 --> 00:02:19,240
like to say that we've evolved and we've

63
00:02:19,240 --> 00:02:21,520
gone from the Death Star to a ninja cat

64
00:02:21,520 --> 00:02:24,250
riding a fire-breathing unicorn and this

65
00:02:24,250 --> 00:02:25,870
image is always great I love this image

66
00:02:25,870 --> 00:02:27,430
because it definitely represents a

67
00:02:27,430 --> 00:02:29,709
transition that Microsoft has made over

68
00:02:29,709 --> 00:02:31,810
the last years into trying to be a

69
00:02:31,810 --> 00:02:33,970
little bit more empathetic I couldn't

70
00:02:33,970 --> 00:02:36,850
I'm gonna call it to developers now mind

71
00:02:36,850 --> 00:02:39,280
you that I understand the pain I I led

72
00:02:39,280 --> 00:02:41,530
the developer relations team for the

73
00:02:41,530 --> 00:02:43,239
Internet Explorer browser yes

74
00:02:43,239 --> 00:02:45,550
Internet Explorer that's to show you how

75
00:02:45,550 --> 00:02:47,739
long haven't had Microsoft and I

76
00:02:47,739 --> 00:02:50,769
remember when I'd walk into conferences

77
00:02:50,769 --> 00:02:53,260
I gave a presentation and by the end of

78
00:02:53,260 --> 00:02:55,330
it I was walking out like this you know

79
00:02:55,330 --> 00:02:57,850
I always had my flame-retardant suit and

80
00:02:57,850 --> 00:03:01,330
was ready to just walk out the event and

81
00:03:01,330 --> 00:03:03,100
be blessed because a lot of developers

82
00:03:03,100 --> 00:03:06,730
had that big disdain that foreigner and

83
00:03:06,730 --> 00:03:07,800
Explorer and rightfully so

84
00:03:07,800 --> 00:03:10,540
Internet Explorer I'd stay but it kind

85
00:03:10,540 --> 00:03:12,370
of lasted too long and so there were

86
00:03:12,370 --> 00:03:13,870
plenty of jokes out there you know

87
00:03:13,870 --> 00:03:15,760
here's Chrome and here's Firefox and

88
00:03:15,760 --> 00:03:17,440
they're battling it out and here's

89
00:03:17,440 --> 00:03:19,269
Internet Explorer eating glue on the

90
00:03:19,269 --> 00:03:22,030
side so yeah I got all those jokes

91
00:03:22,030 --> 00:03:24,489
totally funny and and then eventually

92
00:03:24,489 --> 00:03:27,430
edge came out and god oh my god I was so

93
00:03:27,430 --> 00:03:29,170
happy because when I would have

94
00:03:29,170 --> 00:03:31,209
conversations about web standards with

95
00:03:31,209 --> 00:03:33,340
with developers it was a whole lot

96
00:03:33,340 --> 00:03:35,950
easier for them to appreciate the things

97
00:03:35,950 --> 00:03:38,230
that we were talking about because edge

98
00:03:38,230 --> 00:03:41,230
had a lot of stamps in place and I'm

99
00:03:41,230 --> 00:03:42,880
kind of laying the foundation for this

100
00:03:42,880 --> 00:03:44,230
because it's important to understand

101
00:03:44,230 --> 00:03:46,780
that as developers we were to build

102
00:03:46,780 --> 00:03:49,690
these cross browser solution solutions

103
00:03:49,690 --> 00:03:50,950
that can work across multiple devices

104
00:03:50,950 --> 00:03:54,100
and it's really important for the

105
00:03:54,100 --> 00:03:55,510
browser to just work and of course now

106
00:03:55,510 --> 00:03:59,260
there's a whole new edge and and that's

107
00:03:59,260 --> 00:04:01,209
great as well and it's based on the

108
00:04:01,209 --> 00:04:04,060
chromium engine and so some of those

109
00:04:04,060 --> 00:04:05,920
issues that were there an edge and of

110
00:04:05,920 --> 00:04:08,350
course Internet Explorer now are kind of

111
00:04:08,350 --> 00:04:09,820
going by the wayside and developers who

112
00:04:09,820 --> 00:04:12,130
focus really on producing the best

113
00:04:12,130 --> 00:04:14,470
experience as possible but one of the

114
00:04:14,470 --> 00:04:16,209
things that I continue to see as I was

115
00:04:16,209 --> 00:04:18,579
leading the the Internet Explorer team

116
00:04:18,579 --> 00:04:20,500
or an Android developer relations team

117
00:04:20,500 --> 00:04:22,750
and eventually edge depth of developer

118
00:04:22,750 --> 00:04:24,909
relations team is that security was

119
00:04:24,909 --> 00:04:25,270
something

120
00:04:25,270 --> 00:04:29,110
didn't see disgust often in in the

121
00:04:29,110 --> 00:04:31,660
developer conferences that I go to so we

122
00:04:31,660 --> 00:04:33,879
would we would talk about web browsers

123
00:04:33,879 --> 00:04:35,349
we would talk about cross browsers we

124
00:04:35,349 --> 00:04:37,300
would talk about what standards but the

125
00:04:37,300 --> 00:04:39,430
application security just wasn't

126
00:04:39,430 --> 00:04:42,340
something that was what was being passed

127
00:04:42,340 --> 00:04:44,139
around with developers and so that kind

128
00:04:44,139 --> 00:04:45,940
of struck me and I developed this

129
00:04:45,940 --> 00:04:48,009
interest in security and I remember that

130
00:04:48,009 --> 00:04:50,139
I posted this and I said I would love to

131
00:04:50,139 --> 00:04:51,960
go to DEFCON but I'm scared

132
00:04:51,960 --> 00:04:55,180
mmm to go to DEFCON and because DEFCON

133
00:04:55,180 --> 00:04:57,190
had this reputation of being kind of

134
00:04:57,190 --> 00:04:58,930
like a wild scene where everybody said a

135
00:04:58,930 --> 00:05:01,389
hack to you and things like that but the

136
00:05:01,389 --> 00:05:02,919
the interest was built they are the

137
00:05:02,919 --> 00:05:05,020
interesting securing applications

138
00:05:05,020 --> 00:05:06,220
securing people getting a better

139
00:05:06,220 --> 00:05:07,750
understanding of the community was there

140
00:05:07,750 --> 00:05:10,930
and the deeper that I got into it the

141
00:05:10,930 --> 00:05:12,130
more I realized there was this

142
00:05:12,130 --> 00:05:17,590
fundamental gap in knowledge between the

143
00:05:17,590 --> 00:05:19,750
developer community and the security

144
00:05:19,750 --> 00:05:21,909
community there wasn't this overlap of

145
00:05:21,909 --> 00:05:23,590
conversation you had some professionals

146
00:05:23,590 --> 00:05:25,419
they're really good they were doing app

147
00:05:25,419 --> 00:05:27,940
stack you had folks like Tanya gonca and

148
00:05:27,940 --> 00:05:29,949
Kevin Johnson who were out there beating

149
00:05:29,949 --> 00:05:32,889
that drum on app sack but I think you

150
00:05:32,889 --> 00:05:34,750
know maybe the megaphone just wasn't

151
00:05:34,750 --> 00:05:37,180
loud enough at that time to really get

152
00:05:37,180 --> 00:05:40,120
the word out and then for me the big

153
00:05:40,120 --> 00:05:42,279
thing that hit me in where I realized I

154
00:05:42,279 --> 00:05:44,469
could make an impact at least I hope is

155
00:05:44,469 --> 00:05:46,960
when one I cry had a nose how does a big

156
00:05:46,960 --> 00:05:50,139
deal because I saw hospitals being

157
00:05:50,139 --> 00:05:52,930
locked down I saw ransomware locking

158
00:05:52,930 --> 00:05:55,360
these systems on and preventing health

159
00:05:55,360 --> 00:05:56,650
care professionals from providing the

160
00:05:56,650 --> 00:05:59,500
care that patients needed whether it was

161
00:05:59,500 --> 00:06:02,080
a cancer patient or dialysis patient or

162
00:06:02,080 --> 00:06:04,120
any type of emergency situation has sat

163
00:06:04,120 --> 00:06:05,590
there and said what was it what if it

164
00:06:05,590 --> 00:06:08,050
was one of my family members and I

165
00:06:08,050 --> 00:06:10,560
really started to think about this and

166
00:06:10,560 --> 00:06:13,210
wondered what can I do to help out the

167
00:06:13,210 --> 00:06:14,800
situation versus just sitting there and

168
00:06:14,800 --> 00:06:16,210
talking about what standards all day

169
00:06:16,210 --> 00:06:19,509
long um so I dug into a little bit

170
00:06:19,509 --> 00:06:22,000
further I went to Def Con learned a lot

171
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:23,620
and the one thing that came away I came

172
00:06:23,620 --> 00:06:26,440
away was app Seca's is really hard

173
00:06:26,440 --> 00:06:31,120
there's there's this this friction

174
00:06:31,120 --> 00:06:33,839
that's always going on between

175
00:06:33,839 --> 00:06:36,430
leadership teams who want to build

176
00:06:36,430 --> 00:06:38,340
really engaging user

177
00:06:38,340 --> 00:06:39,990
periences they want to prop them fast

178
00:06:39,990 --> 00:06:42,270
and you have developers who are very

179
00:06:42,270 --> 00:06:43,919
vested in their code and they want to

180
00:06:43,919 --> 00:06:46,320
build solid code and then you have the

181
00:06:46,320 --> 00:06:49,889
IT group and now which is called DevOps

182
00:06:49,889 --> 00:06:52,080
and they want to have a solid

183
00:06:52,080 --> 00:06:53,760
infrastructure and there's always

184
00:06:53,760 --> 00:06:56,010
challenges between the all three of them

185
00:06:56,010 --> 00:06:58,010
because they're pulling and pushing and

186
00:06:58,010 --> 00:07:00,449
management wants to get it out the

187
00:07:00,449 --> 00:07:02,370
developers want to build the solid code

188
00:07:02,370 --> 00:07:05,240
the eye team wants to have security and

189
00:07:05,240 --> 00:07:07,740
there's not this merging in the middle

190
00:07:07,740 --> 00:07:09,510
of most of the time and in fact when you

191
00:07:09,510 --> 00:07:11,729
think about iti mean I think most IT

192
00:07:11,729 --> 00:07:14,100
people think this is what developers do

193
00:07:14,100 --> 00:07:16,740
we're just out there and you know

194
00:07:16,740 --> 00:07:19,229
getting sitting in the sun shining out

195
00:07:19,229 --> 00:07:22,440
and having drinks served to us and while

196
00:07:22,440 --> 00:07:24,900
they're busy toiling in the back in

197
00:07:24,900 --> 00:07:27,620
reality there's a tremendous

198
00:07:27,620 --> 00:07:29,700
responsibility for developers there's a

199
00:07:29,700 --> 00:07:31,080
variety of different frameworks that

200
00:07:31,080 --> 00:07:33,930
have to be implemented to make the most

201
00:07:33,930 --> 00:07:37,260
modern apps responsive and engaging to

202
00:07:37,260 --> 00:07:40,080
users and and yes I'm showing my age and

203
00:07:40,080 --> 00:07:40,889
some of these things because some of

204
00:07:40,889 --> 00:07:43,320
these you know they're they're not used

205
00:07:43,320 --> 00:07:46,190
heavily anymore like jQuery you know but

206
00:07:46,190 --> 00:07:48,600
there's there's still a lot of new

207
00:07:48,600 --> 00:07:51,000
tooling this coming out and developers

208
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:52,440
want to embrace this new tooling because

209
00:07:52,440 --> 00:07:54,330
they know they can build scalable

210
00:07:54,330 --> 00:07:57,960
systems that are reliable and they're

211
00:07:57,960 --> 00:07:59,910
stable and they can build new features

212
00:07:59,910 --> 00:08:02,310
but with that what happens is that there

213
00:08:02,310 --> 00:08:04,530
becomes an increased level of complexity

214
00:08:04,530 --> 00:08:07,020
and that complexity adds to the security

215
00:08:07,020 --> 00:08:08,580
issues that we're seeing on the

216
00:08:08,580 --> 00:08:10,770
application side and so the IT admins

217
00:08:10,770 --> 00:08:12,780
look at us under like hold on a second

218
00:08:12,780 --> 00:08:15,690
you know you want all this stuff and you

219
00:08:15,690 --> 00:08:17,669
know that's they kind of frown upon that

220
00:08:17,669 --> 00:08:20,039
and so we sometimes we back to rhythm

221
00:08:20,039 --> 00:08:21,720
and we install it anyways and then of

222
00:08:21,720 --> 00:08:24,030
course they come in and they just you

223
00:08:24,030 --> 00:08:26,820
know strike lightning on us you know so

224
00:08:26,820 --> 00:08:30,360
it's it's not an easy thing to balance

225
00:08:30,360 --> 00:08:33,270
and to some extent I can't blame them if

226
00:08:33,270 --> 00:08:35,909
we look at the history of applications

227
00:08:35,909 --> 00:08:38,309
security I don't think that as

228
00:08:38,309 --> 00:08:40,830
developers we've done everything we can

229
00:08:40,830 --> 00:08:43,469
to be really on top of the situation

230
00:08:43,469 --> 00:08:45,750
that's that's presenting itself and this

231
00:08:45,750 --> 00:08:48,300
was a great example of when there was a

232
00:08:48,300 --> 00:08:51,720
supply chain attack in MPM and

233
00:08:51,720 --> 00:08:52,920
basically what ended up happening is

234
00:08:52,920 --> 00:08:54,990
that somebody decided that they were

235
00:08:54,990 --> 00:08:57,569
going to take advantage and if I

236
00:08:57,569 --> 00:09:02,250
remember this was a a deprecated oh and

237
00:09:02,250 --> 00:09:03,899
I'm sorry in this one this is when a

238
00:09:03,899 --> 00:09:08,220
developer left passwords in code and it

239
00:09:08,220 --> 00:09:09,569
was actually be able to see and then

240
00:09:09,569 --> 00:09:12,990
this one is when we had this particular

241
00:09:12,990 --> 00:09:14,910
package here called electron native

242
00:09:14,910 --> 00:09:17,579
notify which ended up having a supply

243
00:09:17,579 --> 00:09:20,009
supply chain attack and making a

244
00:09:20,009 --> 00:09:22,589
malicious pay look so when if you were

245
00:09:22,589 --> 00:09:24,930
taking advantage of this package all a

246
00:09:24,930 --> 00:09:27,750
sudden that payload got injected by

247
00:09:27,750 --> 00:09:31,470
default into your system when when you

248
00:09:31,470 --> 00:09:33,769
updated and that's a scary proposition

249
00:09:33,769 --> 00:09:36,240
because if you're not if you're not

250
00:09:36,240 --> 00:09:38,699
analyzing the code that's being that's

251
00:09:38,699 --> 00:09:40,860
going to your system you're you're

252
00:09:40,860 --> 00:09:43,769
setting yourself up to be to be

253
00:09:43,769 --> 00:09:46,709
compromised but here's the thing if we

254
00:09:46,709 --> 00:09:49,769
think about the complexity of our

255
00:09:49,769 --> 00:09:52,920
systems of package management the C ICD

256
00:09:52,920 --> 00:09:54,689
and all the steps that go into building

257
00:09:54,689 --> 00:09:57,449
these advanced advanced applications

258
00:09:57,449 --> 00:10:00,149
it's hard to verify all the code it

259
00:10:00,149 --> 00:10:02,279
truly is and you know they have

260
00:10:02,279 --> 00:10:03,990
predicted this was gonna happen in NPM

261
00:10:03,990 --> 00:10:06,600
that eventually somebody was going to do

262
00:10:06,600 --> 00:10:09,509
a supply chain attack and it would

263
00:10:09,509 --> 00:10:11,430
affect a large number of users and in

264
00:10:11,430 --> 00:10:12,899
fact if you go through here and you look

265
00:10:12,899 --> 00:10:14,490
at the pendency graph for this

266
00:10:14,490 --> 00:10:16,379
particular of this particular module

267
00:10:16,379 --> 00:10:18,019
you'll see what they're talking about

268
00:10:18,019 --> 00:10:20,910
you scroll down and scroll down think

269
00:10:20,910 --> 00:10:22,769
about if you were you would be able to

270
00:10:22,769 --> 00:10:25,829
actually review every line of code that

271
00:10:25,829 --> 00:10:29,550
you are taking a dependency on when you

272
00:10:29,550 --> 00:10:31,800
install react when you install angular

273
00:10:31,800 --> 00:10:33,990
when you installed any type of package

274
00:10:33,990 --> 00:10:36,420
nowadays most of them take a dependency

275
00:10:36,420 --> 00:10:38,759
on another package and unless you have a

276
00:10:38,759 --> 00:10:41,610
really really great amount of time to

277
00:10:41,610 --> 00:10:43,889
inspect the code you're gonna run to

278
00:10:43,889 --> 00:10:45,089
something like this where you're gonna

279
00:10:45,089 --> 00:10:46,889
have this really long dependency chain

280
00:10:46,889 --> 00:10:48,569
and you're just not going to have the

281
00:10:48,569 --> 00:10:50,639
time to analyze every bit of code in

282
00:10:50,639 --> 00:10:53,040
every one of those dependencies and in

283
00:10:53,040 --> 00:10:55,139
fact when you you know there was a poll

284
00:10:55,139 --> 00:10:57,839
that sneaked it and they actually asked

285
00:10:57,839 --> 00:11:00,240
OS maintainer x' and you know they if

286
00:11:00,240 --> 00:11:02,459
you look at this it's kind of a scary

287
00:11:02,459 --> 00:11:05,220
graph because oh you know

288
00:11:05,220 --> 00:11:06,899
says OS maintainers differ in their code

289
00:11:06,899 --> 00:11:10,350
auditing maintenance and 26% of them

290
00:11:10,350 --> 00:11:13,699
said that they don't audit their code

291
00:11:13,699 --> 00:11:17,610
think about that Louis you know

292
00:11:17,610 --> 00:11:21,000
open-source is a critical aspect to to

293
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:23,519
software development nowadays there's no

294
00:11:23,519 --> 00:11:24,360
way around that

295
00:11:24,360 --> 00:11:28,050
but you're taking a dependency on open

296
00:11:28,050 --> 00:11:29,370
source how do you know that those

297
00:11:29,370 --> 00:11:31,259
maintainer czar actually auditing their

298
00:11:31,259 --> 00:11:33,029
code that they're doing their due

299
00:11:33,029 --> 00:11:34,470
diligence to make sure that that code

300
00:11:34,470 --> 00:11:37,199
that you're relying on is secure and

301
00:11:37,199 --> 00:11:39,360
that's the problem we have this thing

302
00:11:39,360 --> 00:11:41,189
called implicit trust where we assume

303
00:11:41,189 --> 00:11:44,790
that everything that's on NPM everything

304
00:11:44,790 --> 00:11:47,639
that's open source is just safe and we

305
00:11:47,639 --> 00:11:50,310
shouldn't we really really shouldn't and

306
00:11:50,310 --> 00:11:52,319
and this reinforces against sneaked

307
00:11:52,319 --> 00:11:53,970
again saying how do you find

308
00:11:53,970 --> 00:11:54,839
vulnerabilities

309
00:11:54,839 --> 00:11:57,870
well 36% said we use dependency

310
00:11:57,870 --> 00:11:59,550
management scanning tools that notifies

311
00:11:59,550 --> 00:12:02,399
us that's great but there here it is

312
00:12:02,399 --> 00:12:06,660
right here 27% said I probably won't

313
00:12:06,660 --> 00:12:10,889
find vulnerabilities that's a very scary

314
00:12:10,889 --> 00:12:14,040
proposition and I'm guilty about I'm

315
00:12:14,040 --> 00:12:16,050
guilty of this by the way because I

316
00:12:16,050 --> 00:12:18,329
developed in a variety of languages I've

317
00:12:18,329 --> 00:12:18,930
developed

318
00:12:18,930 --> 00:12:21,360
obviously in JavaScript and note you

319
00:12:21,360 --> 00:12:23,790
know using node and using NPM and I've

320
00:12:23,790 --> 00:12:26,430
done these things I've I've depended on

321
00:12:26,430 --> 00:12:30,209
the dependencies these packages and just

322
00:12:30,209 --> 00:12:31,829
took it for granted until I got into

323
00:12:31,829 --> 00:12:33,569
security and I started really looking at

324
00:12:33,569 --> 00:12:36,269
deeper into this and I saw the gravity

325
00:12:36,269 --> 00:12:38,189
of the problem and we do have a big

326
00:12:38,189 --> 00:12:41,879
problem so there was a dark reading did

327
00:12:41,879 --> 00:12:44,939
a great article on this and if you read

328
00:12:44,939 --> 00:12:46,319
through this real quick it says each web

329
00:12:46,319 --> 00:12:48,000
application that positive technologies

330
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:51,000
inspect it contains 33 vulnerabilities

331
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:55,620
and of those 2/3 of those apps a 67

332
00:12:55,620 --> 00:12:56,850
percent contained critical

333
00:12:56,850 --> 00:12:59,009
vulnerabilities such as insufficient

334
00:12:59,009 --> 00:13:01,290
authorization errors arbitrary file

335
00:13:01,290 --> 00:13:04,110
upload path traversal and sequel

336
00:13:04,110 --> 00:13:06,569
injection now mind you you look at the

337
00:13:06,569 --> 00:13:09,089
Olas top 10 sequel injection is still

338
00:13:09,089 --> 00:13:12,389
number 1 why is that after all this time

339
00:13:12,389 --> 00:13:13,649
and all these technologies that we have

340
00:13:13,649 --> 00:13:16,649
why a sequel injection still the number

341
00:13:16,649 --> 00:13:18,470
one thing

342
00:13:18,470 --> 00:13:20,730
being a you know being a developer I

343
00:13:20,730 --> 00:13:23,310
have to say is sometimes I think we tend

344
00:13:23,310 --> 00:13:26,010
to be in such a rush to get things done

345
00:13:26,010 --> 00:13:28,080
then we overlook some of the granular

346
00:13:28,080 --> 00:13:29,910
details about of the things we're doing

347
00:13:29,910 --> 00:13:32,280
I II know some people say developers are

348
00:13:32,280 --> 00:13:33,930
lazy I don't think the developers are

349
00:13:33,930 --> 00:13:35,820
lazy I think developers are trying to

350
00:13:35,820 --> 00:13:37,290
streamline things as much as possible

351
00:13:37,290 --> 00:13:39,360
and in the process of trying to

352
00:13:39,360 --> 00:13:40,920
streamline the work that they're doing

353
00:13:40,920 --> 00:13:43,020
sometimes they overlook these things and

354
00:13:43,020 --> 00:13:46,790
a sequel injection or a path traversal

355
00:13:46,790 --> 00:13:50,070
vulnerability it can be catastrophic to

356
00:13:50,070 --> 00:13:53,190
a company so we continue on in you know

357
00:13:53,190 --> 00:13:54,840
very code and we saw Chris White's

358
00:13:54,840 --> 00:13:58,080
little poll during one of the ads and

359
00:13:58,080 --> 00:14:01,200
he's a big advocate for application

360
00:14:01,200 --> 00:14:03,210
security so I loved the fact that very

361
00:14:03,210 --> 00:14:04,770
code puts us out and that they found

362
00:14:04,770 --> 00:14:08,250
just 52 percent of components that you

363
00:14:08,250 --> 00:14:10,290
know these app developers use that they

364
00:14:10,290 --> 00:14:13,890
told let me read that very cold

365
00:14:13,890 --> 00:14:16,200
confirmed app developer from the UK US

366
00:14:16,200 --> 00:14:18,030
and Jeremy found just a 50 percent

367
00:14:18,030 --> 00:14:20,310
update components when a new

368
00:14:20,310 --> 00:14:23,550
vulnerability is announced that means

369
00:14:23,550 --> 00:14:26,610
that either they're not taking the steps

370
00:14:26,610 --> 00:14:29,250
to patch things or they don't know about

371
00:14:29,250 --> 00:14:32,430
it and either way that's a bad thing I

372
00:14:32,430 --> 00:14:34,890
think as application developers it's

373
00:14:34,890 --> 00:14:36,600
critically important that we start

374
00:14:36,600 --> 00:14:38,700
thinking with security mindset we start

375
00:14:38,700 --> 00:14:41,040
understanding what does it take to build

376
00:14:41,040 --> 00:14:44,640
secure software and we can't allow

377
00:14:44,640 --> 00:14:46,920
ourselves to get into the situation

378
00:14:46,920 --> 00:14:49,110
where we don't understand where

379
00:14:49,110 --> 00:14:51,960
components are now vulnerable we can't

380
00:14:51,960 --> 00:14:54,420
put ourselves in situations where these

381
00:14:54,420 --> 00:14:55,950
things are announced whether it's

382
00:14:55,950 --> 00:14:58,320
through a CBE or some other form of

383
00:14:58,320 --> 00:14:59,910
public disclosure and that we're not

384
00:14:59,910 --> 00:15:02,510
aware of that and what I do love is that

385
00:15:02,510 --> 00:15:05,010
companies are like sneak and very code

386
00:15:05,010 --> 00:15:07,800
and white source are stepping up to help

387
00:15:07,800 --> 00:15:10,260
us become more efficient and secure

388
00:15:10,260 --> 00:15:12,870
developers and the reason I'm really

389
00:15:12,870 --> 00:15:14,820
happy is because to be honest web apps

390
00:15:14,820 --> 00:15:16,740
and api's are the new attack endpoints

391
00:15:16,740 --> 00:15:17,910
when you think about hacking and you

392
00:15:17,910 --> 00:15:19,650
think about hackers and all the stuff

393
00:15:19,650 --> 00:15:21,300
you you always think they're hacking the

394
00:15:21,300 --> 00:15:23,010
network and they're going into some

395
00:15:23,010 --> 00:15:25,500
low-level protocol and they're just

396
00:15:25,500 --> 00:15:29,460
doing mr. robot magic stuff and having

397
00:15:29,460 --> 00:15:30,240
gone through

398
00:15:30,240 --> 00:15:31,740
courses that teach me both web

399
00:15:31,740 --> 00:15:34,230
application pen testing and also network

400
00:15:34,230 --> 00:15:35,370
pen testing I can tell you that

401
00:15:35,370 --> 00:15:40,700
suffocates the likelihood that a a

402
00:15:40,700 --> 00:15:44,010
medium experienced hacker could break

403
00:15:44,010 --> 00:15:47,220
into a network is very slim because so

404
00:15:47,220 --> 00:15:48,720
many companies are now going cloud

405
00:15:48,720 --> 00:15:49,980
native and that means that the

406
00:15:49,980 --> 00:15:52,500
infrastructure side is becoming much

407
00:15:52,500 --> 00:15:54,959
more secure when they do hack is usually

408
00:15:54,959 --> 00:15:56,339
miss configuration it's not like they've

409
00:15:56,339 --> 00:15:58,920
created some you know novel kernel

410
00:15:58,920 --> 00:16:00,839
exploit that they you know there are

411
00:16:00,839 --> 00:16:02,430
super wizards it's usually a miss

412
00:16:02,430 --> 00:16:05,430
configuration but that's becoming far a

413
00:16:05,430 --> 00:16:08,040
few words a bit far fewer far for you in

414
00:16:08,040 --> 00:16:10,589
between and harder to find and

415
00:16:10,589 --> 00:16:11,970
especially when you have things like bug

416
00:16:11,970 --> 00:16:13,140
bounty programs which are out there

417
00:16:13,140 --> 00:16:15,510
proactively testing I do feel for the

418
00:16:15,510 --> 00:16:17,520
small medium and small and medium-sized

419
00:16:17,520 --> 00:16:18,870
businesses though because they don't

420
00:16:18,870 --> 00:16:21,630
have the teams in place that allow them

421
00:16:21,630 --> 00:16:25,140
to do this repetitive type of testing

422
00:16:25,140 --> 00:16:28,110
this inner recycle of testing and fixing

423
00:16:28,110 --> 00:16:30,300
and testing and fixing and so I think

424
00:16:30,300 --> 00:16:31,920
some of the things that I'll talk about

425
00:16:31,920 --> 00:16:33,480
later on in this presentation will

426
00:16:33,480 --> 00:16:35,070
hopefully address some of that for small

427
00:16:35,070 --> 00:16:37,290
and medium size businesses but it's

428
00:16:37,290 --> 00:16:39,360
really important to think about web apps

429
00:16:39,360 --> 00:16:41,910
and api's now as being that new target

430
00:16:41,910 --> 00:16:44,790
for develop for hackers because the

431
00:16:44,790 --> 00:16:46,290
mistakes that you make whether it's a

432
00:16:46,290 --> 00:16:48,209
patch reverse or sequel injection or

433
00:16:48,209 --> 00:16:50,610
work crime side scripting or something

434
00:16:50,610 --> 00:16:53,010
like that it can allow full system

435
00:16:53,010 --> 00:16:55,950
access to a very experienced hacker

436
00:16:55,950 --> 00:16:58,110
somebody who understands how to get into

437
00:16:58,110 --> 00:17:01,050
web apps and capitalize on that to open

438
00:17:01,050 --> 00:17:05,000
up a particular web shell for example

439
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:08,790
now I think as as developers we do have

440
00:17:08,790 --> 00:17:10,530
to think about security in the first

441
00:17:10,530 --> 00:17:12,059
place that I'd recommend people to go to

442
00:17:12,059 --> 00:17:15,689
is go to the Olaf site and look review

443
00:17:15,689 --> 00:17:19,459
the Olas top ten this was it from 2017

444
00:17:19,459 --> 00:17:23,040
and now the most recent one came out and

445
00:17:23,040 --> 00:17:24,900
that's 2020 and I'm going to show you

446
00:17:24,900 --> 00:17:26,699
the list of the top ten in a second but

447
00:17:26,699 --> 00:17:28,740
I wanted to keep this link out there for

448
00:17:28,740 --> 00:17:29,940
a second because I think it's important

449
00:17:29,940 --> 00:17:31,770
that as developers we get familiar with

450
00:17:31,770 --> 00:17:35,850
how security is consistent kids his

451
00:17:35,850 --> 00:17:38,210
eerie is viewed within the context of

452
00:17:38,210 --> 00:17:40,350
applications especially web application

453
00:17:40,350 --> 00:17:43,860
so please go to ole lost that org

454
00:17:43,860 --> 00:17:45,690
and start looking over the material

455
00:17:45,690 --> 00:17:46,830
there I think if it'll be shocked by

456
00:17:46,830 --> 00:17:48,150
what we find I think you're gonna be

457
00:17:48,150 --> 00:17:49,559
impressed by what you find it actually

458
00:17:49,559 --> 00:17:51,750
might motivate you to start getting your

459
00:17:51,750 --> 00:17:53,130
hands a little bit dirty when it comes

460
00:17:53,130 --> 00:17:54,780
to security there's a whole ton of best

461
00:17:54,780 --> 00:17:56,580
practices in there along with

462
00:17:56,580 --> 00:17:58,170
applications that are vulnerable that

463
00:17:58,170 --> 00:18:00,299
you can test your skills out but we'll

464
00:18:00,299 --> 00:18:01,890
get to that in a second I'm going to

465
00:18:01,890 --> 00:18:03,840
point out some of those if you look at

466
00:18:03,840 --> 00:18:09,049
the top ten in terms of security again

467
00:18:09,049 --> 00:18:12,000
injection vulnerabilities are number one

468
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:15,600
and that's not that's just that's SQL no

469
00:18:15,600 --> 00:18:19,410
SQL operating systems LDAP systems why

470
00:18:19,410 --> 00:18:23,040
is that in the year 2020 we continue to

471
00:18:23,040 --> 00:18:25,020
have these things and again I attribute

472
00:18:25,020 --> 00:18:26,880
it to the fact that we have so much

473
00:18:26,880 --> 00:18:29,760
demand from leadership teams from ITA

474
00:18:29,760 --> 00:18:32,910
and also I think we're also becoming

475
00:18:32,910 --> 00:18:34,970
very reliant on third-party frameworks

476
00:18:34,970 --> 00:18:37,230
without truly understanding what's going

477
00:18:37,230 --> 00:18:39,840
on on under the hood to ensure that we

478
00:18:39,840 --> 00:18:42,990
have security in the system we can't be

479
00:18:42,990 --> 00:18:45,240
reliant on third-party frameworks to

480
00:18:45,240 --> 00:18:47,100
protect us as developers we have to

481
00:18:47,100 --> 00:18:49,110
really think about what we're doing when

482
00:18:49,110 --> 00:18:51,000
we're accepting data when we're putting

483
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:53,610
data out there how we're interacting and

484
00:18:53,610 --> 00:18:56,850
our extent allowing other people to to

485
00:18:56,850 --> 00:18:59,520
access the data that we're storing you

486
00:18:59,520 --> 00:19:01,410
know with GDP are now it's critically

487
00:19:01,410 --> 00:19:05,460
important that we protect that PII as

488
00:19:05,460 --> 00:19:08,700
much as possible the number of breaches

489
00:19:08,700 --> 00:19:11,809
that I read about that are in plain text

490
00:19:11,809 --> 00:19:15,059
floors me and I think as they're as

491
00:19:15,059 --> 00:19:17,640
developers we need to get familiar with

492
00:19:17,640 --> 00:19:19,679
encryption we need to understand that

493
00:19:19,679 --> 00:19:23,580
encryption is critical to protecting the

494
00:19:23,580 --> 00:19:26,309
data that is that is so important to our

495
00:19:26,309 --> 00:19:28,860
to our customers in our company the

496
00:19:28,860 --> 00:19:31,350
livelihoods and safety of people there's

497
00:19:31,350 --> 00:19:33,480
no reason why anybody should be storing

498
00:19:33,480 --> 00:19:35,520
plaintext data nowadays when

499
00:19:35,520 --> 00:19:37,830
encryption technologies are so simple to

500
00:19:37,830 --> 00:19:39,990
implement in many cases you know

501
00:19:39,990 --> 00:19:43,890
encryption data at rest should be a just

502
00:19:43,890 --> 00:19:46,110
a standard principle that we abide by

503
00:19:46,110 --> 00:19:48,960
and this comes into thinking about

504
00:19:48,960 --> 00:19:51,990
security from the very beginning one of

505
00:19:51,990 --> 00:19:55,200
the things that that the dev set-offs

506
00:19:55,200 --> 00:19:57,270
community loves to talk about

507
00:19:57,270 --> 00:20:01,200
shift left it's moving your mindset and

508
00:20:01,200 --> 00:20:03,570
all the way to the left of the

509
00:20:03,570 --> 00:20:05,220
development process so that security

510
00:20:05,220 --> 00:20:08,730
becomes part of the whole entire cycle

511
00:20:08,730 --> 00:20:11,370
not just at the end of it it shouldn't

512
00:20:11,370 --> 00:20:12,990
be an afterthought we should be

513
00:20:12,990 --> 00:20:15,300
considering security at the requirement

514
00:20:15,300 --> 00:20:17,640
stage the design stage coding testing

515
00:20:17,640 --> 00:20:21,120
and release our CI and CV pipelines

516
00:20:21,120 --> 00:20:23,370
should have some form of security

517
00:20:23,370 --> 00:20:27,030
auditing and analysis capability now I'm

518
00:20:27,030 --> 00:20:29,040
not saying this is gonna be easy

519
00:20:29,040 --> 00:20:30,690
I think it's gonna be a hard pill for

520
00:20:30,690 --> 00:20:32,610
for something small but you're like oh

521
00:20:32,610 --> 00:20:34,410
my god I already have so much work and

522
00:20:34,410 --> 00:20:36,720
now I have to be a security expert I

523
00:20:36,720 --> 00:20:38,730
don't think you need to be a security

524
00:20:38,730 --> 00:20:40,410
extra I think you need to be security

525
00:20:40,410 --> 00:20:42,630
savvy and the great thing is there is a

526
00:20:42,630 --> 00:20:45,300
lot of automation happening now that's

527
00:20:45,300 --> 00:20:48,000
meant to help developers become more

528
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:50,160
proficient in identifying these issues

529
00:20:50,160 --> 00:20:51,900
that could compromise your ear

530
00:20:51,900 --> 00:20:54,360
compromised your apps and so when we

531
00:20:54,360 --> 00:20:55,770
talk about that we're you know we talk

532
00:20:55,770 --> 00:20:58,290
about automation a lot we automate so

533
00:20:58,290 --> 00:20:59,700
many things but you know webpack

534
00:20:59,700 --> 00:21:01,620
automates our build of our application

535
00:21:01,620 --> 00:21:04,050
we talked about Jenkins for deployment

536
00:21:04,050 --> 00:21:06,090
and kubernetes and all these things that

537
00:21:06,090 --> 00:21:09,630
automate our our life our development

538
00:21:09,630 --> 00:21:12,780
life at least why not automate some of

539
00:21:12,780 --> 00:21:14,820
the security and leave it to

540
00:21:14,820 --> 00:21:17,040
professionals who truly know what

541
00:21:17,040 --> 00:21:20,130
they're doing the ones who are that

542
00:21:20,130 --> 00:21:22,310
their whole world revolves around

543
00:21:22,310 --> 00:21:25,500
securing systems in some fashion and so

544
00:21:25,500 --> 00:21:27,810
you look at this graph from white source

545
00:21:27,810 --> 00:21:30,540
and so before automating your open

546
00:21:30,540 --> 00:21:34,110
source over 75% were weird to only 50%

547
00:21:34,110 --> 00:21:37,890
of their open source inventory now think

548
00:21:37,890 --> 00:21:39,930
about that think about how much open

549
00:21:39,930 --> 00:21:42,510
source you ingest every single time you

550
00:21:42,510 --> 00:21:45,630
build an app and how many of you

551
00:21:45,630 --> 00:21:48,350
actually know what you're ingesting

552
00:21:48,350 --> 00:21:50,820
wholesale what is it that you do you

553
00:21:50,820 --> 00:21:52,830
know every module is getting brought in

554
00:21:52,830 --> 00:21:55,080
some of you may say yeah I know them all

555
00:21:55,080 --> 00:21:57,030
and that's great um you know more power

556
00:21:57,030 --> 00:22:00,900
to you but how many of you truly know

557
00:22:00,900 --> 00:22:03,840
how much open source software you are

558
00:22:03,840 --> 00:22:05,220
bringing in especially when you're

559
00:22:05,220 --> 00:22:07,350
taking advantage of you know things like

560
00:22:07,350 --> 00:22:09,300
pipeline for Python they're package

561
00:22:09,300 --> 00:22:09,820
manager

562
00:22:09,820 --> 00:22:14,559
or or NPM how many of you know what's

563
00:22:14,559 --> 00:22:17,859
being brought in so you know it's it's

564
00:22:17,859 --> 00:22:19,629
it's a scary proposition when you think

565
00:22:19,629 --> 00:22:21,399
that 90% have at least wonderful

566
00:22:21,399 --> 00:22:24,249
durability and over 45% have five and up

567
00:22:24,249 --> 00:22:26,679
in term in their apps because they're

568
00:22:26,679 --> 00:22:29,229
not aware of the inventory they have and

569
00:22:29,229 --> 00:22:31,539
they're not doing any type of auditing

570
00:22:31,539 --> 00:22:34,509
it's a really scary proposition then I

571
00:22:34,509 --> 00:22:36,279
mean the licensing issues a whole

572
00:22:36,279 --> 00:22:38,950
different world Ness is compliance your

573
00:22:38,950 --> 00:22:40,330
if you're not thinking about compliance

574
00:22:40,330 --> 00:22:42,700
and what the licensing terms of open

575
00:22:42,700 --> 00:22:44,710
source software does to what you're

576
00:22:44,710 --> 00:22:46,299
building out that's a whole nother

577
00:22:46,299 --> 00:22:48,279
conversation to have with your legal

578
00:22:48,279 --> 00:22:49,659
team you should definitely think about

579
00:22:49,659 --> 00:22:51,669
that and I love the fact that companies

580
00:22:51,669 --> 00:22:54,099
like sneek are actually thinking shift

581
00:22:54,099 --> 00:22:56,739
left they are looking at the end to end

582
00:22:56,739 --> 00:22:58,929
and I'll call it I think it's more like

583
00:22:58,929 --> 00:23:00,489
a round trip type of thing they are

584
00:23:00,489 --> 00:23:01,960
thinking from the coding all the way to

585
00:23:01,960 --> 00:23:04,419
the deployment and reporting stages and

586
00:23:04,419 --> 00:23:06,369
I think that's really critical that

587
00:23:06,369 --> 00:23:09,099
their systems are providing that level

588
00:23:09,099 --> 00:23:11,440
of coverage so that as a developer you

589
00:23:11,440 --> 00:23:13,840
can you can have that dynamic analysis

590
00:23:13,840 --> 00:23:16,029
of code using something like I don't

591
00:23:16,029 --> 00:23:18,789
know visual studio or jet rings and that

592
00:23:18,789 --> 00:23:21,070
can it can integrate with version

593
00:23:21,070 --> 00:23:23,649
control systems like github and get lab

594
00:23:23,649 --> 00:23:25,450
and it works across docker and

595
00:23:25,450 --> 00:23:28,479
kubernetes and Heroku and all these

596
00:23:28,479 --> 00:23:31,210
things this is critical it's critical

597
00:23:31,210 --> 00:23:33,009
that you consider these types of

598
00:23:33,009 --> 00:23:35,679
automated systems because they provide

599
00:23:35,679 --> 00:23:38,169
this type of functionality and you want

600
00:23:38,169 --> 00:23:39,909
this type of insight in this case what

601
00:23:39,909 --> 00:23:41,229
source is providing you with a dashboard

602
00:23:41,229 --> 00:23:44,019
that can help you analyze not only the

603
00:23:44,019 --> 00:23:45,999
the vulnerabilities that you have within

604
00:23:45,999 --> 00:23:48,399
your code bases but also any compliance

605
00:23:48,399 --> 00:23:51,039
issues you might have so yes I am an

606
00:23:51,039 --> 00:23:52,809
advocate of using some form of

607
00:23:52,809 --> 00:23:55,149
automation because I know that I can't

608
00:23:55,149 --> 00:23:56,470
do it by myself

609
00:23:56,470 --> 00:23:59,499
I just can't there's just too much code

610
00:23:59,499 --> 00:24:02,619
to analyze and if there are systems in

611
00:24:02,619 --> 00:24:04,359
place that can automate that for me and

612
00:24:04,359 --> 00:24:07,029
allow me to scan my my code and at least

613
00:24:07,029 --> 00:24:10,989
provide me with a 10,000 foot view of

614
00:24:10,989 --> 00:24:14,440
the landscape not only can I help to

615
00:24:14,440 --> 00:24:16,479
solve those problems but I can also work

616
00:24:16,479 --> 00:24:18,190
with leadership to making greater

617
00:24:18,190 --> 00:24:20,859
investments in solving these problems I

618
00:24:20,859 --> 00:24:21,390
can

619
00:24:21,390 --> 00:24:23,740
this is what could happen if I don't

620
00:24:23,740 --> 00:24:27,580
Patty's $27 bol libraries that's that's

621
00:24:27,580 --> 00:24:29,320
something that's very powerful when

622
00:24:29,320 --> 00:24:31,240
you're thinking about how do you present

623
00:24:31,240 --> 00:24:33,039
this to your leadership and your

624
00:24:33,039 --> 00:24:36,190
management chain and even github you

625
00:24:36,190 --> 00:24:38,500
know I love the fact that give up now is

626
00:24:38,500 --> 00:24:41,049
incorporating some of these bits of

627
00:24:41,049 --> 00:24:43,179
functionality directly into the version

628
00:24:43,179 --> 00:24:46,419
control system and so with them you have

629
00:24:46,419 --> 00:24:48,400
something like depend upon which depend

630
00:24:48,400 --> 00:24:50,049
upon will look at your dependencies and

631
00:24:50,049 --> 00:24:51,760
it will actually alert you will sent an

632
00:24:51,760 --> 00:24:53,350
email and I should notify you on the

633
00:24:53,350 --> 00:24:54,820
version control system the dashboard and

634
00:24:54,820 --> 00:24:56,830
say hey you have something that's that's

635
00:24:56,830 --> 00:24:58,210
either out-of-date or that it's

636
00:24:58,210 --> 00:25:00,610
honorable and I think that's really

637
00:25:00,610 --> 00:25:02,620
really important for developers now if

638
00:25:02,620 --> 00:25:03,909
you're a developer and you just kind of

639
00:25:03,909 --> 00:25:06,010
look at and ignore it on a production

640
00:25:06,010 --> 00:25:07,510
you know something that's a production

641
00:25:07,510 --> 00:25:10,500
system then obviously the onus is on you

642
00:25:10,500 --> 00:25:13,900
but it's there and I'm not sure if if a

643
00:25:13,900 --> 00:25:15,490
lot of folks have turned on these

644
00:25:15,490 --> 00:25:17,620
features I'm not sure if folks even know

645
00:25:17,620 --> 00:25:18,820
they're there and I think that's

646
00:25:18,820 --> 00:25:20,650
something that's more or something that

647
00:25:20,650 --> 00:25:24,760
as a company github Microsoft we need to

648
00:25:24,760 --> 00:25:26,890
do more to get that out and that's kind

649
00:25:26,890 --> 00:25:28,090
of one of the reasons I want to bring

650
00:25:28,090 --> 00:25:29,200
into this in there

651
00:25:29,200 --> 00:25:30,850
and in fact the fact that we're now

652
00:25:30,850 --> 00:25:33,880
incorporating code Kewell into Visual

653
00:25:33,880 --> 00:25:35,470
Studio code now you can give dynamic

654
00:25:35,470 --> 00:25:37,150
in-house code bases directly within

655
00:25:37,150 --> 00:25:39,220
Visual Studio code and that's amazing

656
00:25:39,220 --> 00:25:41,620
this is the type of stuff that will help

657
00:25:41,620 --> 00:25:45,190
streamline your development process and

658
00:25:45,190 --> 00:25:47,169
in terms of security you want to be able

659
00:25:47,169 --> 00:25:48,850
to identify these issues you want to be

660
00:25:48,850 --> 00:25:51,490
to solve them quickly before it gets out

661
00:25:51,490 --> 00:25:54,760
of hand and of course to further on we

662
00:25:54,760 --> 00:25:57,730
you know github and I say we because

663
00:25:57,730 --> 00:26:01,690
this is part of Microsoft now give him

664
00:26:01,690 --> 00:26:03,309
acquired NPM and this is a big deal

665
00:26:03,309 --> 00:26:07,000
because it shows that NPM was such an

666
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:10,330
important aspect in development of such

667
00:26:10,330 --> 00:26:11,799
an important service in developers lives

668
00:26:11,799 --> 00:26:14,200
on security had to be really really

669
00:26:14,200 --> 00:26:15,940
stringent and considered and I love that

670
00:26:15,940 --> 00:26:18,130
Adam Baldwin is now it of Adam actually

671
00:26:18,130 --> 00:26:21,130
ran security for the new project he he

672
00:26:21,130 --> 00:26:22,690
actually ran the node security perhaps

673
00:26:22,690 --> 00:26:25,750
before and then came over to MPN and now

674
00:26:25,750 --> 00:26:28,090
is with github and so there's a lot of

675
00:26:28,090 --> 00:26:30,460
great talent that are that are looking

676
00:26:30,460 --> 00:26:33,159
into the security issues of package

677
00:26:33,159 --> 00:26:35,320
management especially

678
00:26:35,320 --> 00:26:36,460
and of course we have other great

679
00:26:36,460 --> 00:26:37,780
companies out there that provides

680
00:26:37,780 --> 00:26:40,090
solutions like barracuda and Qualis and

681
00:26:40,090 --> 00:26:42,820
back Blackduck all of these have have

682
00:26:42,820 --> 00:26:45,100
mature solutions that can certainly help

683
00:26:45,100 --> 00:26:47,410
you out but I think ultimately one of

684
00:26:47,410 --> 00:26:49,510
the things that's going to be a big deal

685
00:26:49,510 --> 00:26:52,470
is for a company to start identifying

686
00:26:52,470 --> 00:26:54,490
security champions and I really like

687
00:26:54,490 --> 00:26:57,010
this term it's identifying people who

688
00:26:57,010 --> 00:26:59,740
are willing to step up and take that

689
00:26:59,740 --> 00:27:02,410
stand and say I want to help build

690
00:27:02,410 --> 00:27:04,000
secure system that I want to help

691
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:06,220
educate others and building secure

692
00:27:06,220 --> 00:27:07,980
systems I want to be that advocate for

693
00:27:07,980 --> 00:27:09,280
security

694
00:27:09,280 --> 00:27:11,710
Jerry mall Jerry Bell said it perfectly

695
00:27:11,710 --> 00:27:15,370
he says I would summarize that what I

696
00:27:15,370 --> 00:27:17,560
heard Ian say is that InfoSec needs to

697
00:27:17,560 --> 00:27:19,600
build bridges to better communicate with

698
00:27:19,600 --> 00:27:22,090
DevOps and that seems right one of the

699
00:27:22,090 --> 00:27:23,350
major challenges I find is that

700
00:27:23,350 --> 00:27:26,110
developers often lack the perspective of

701
00:27:26,110 --> 00:27:28,090
the adversarial mindset and I can I

702
00:27:28,090 --> 00:27:30,640
agree 100% with this and the reason is

703
00:27:30,640 --> 00:27:33,010
because I'm I'm living proof of that I

704
00:27:33,010 --> 00:27:35,200
didn't have that at this hereö mindset I

705
00:27:35,200 --> 00:27:38,740
didn't know what a true hack was until I

706
00:27:38,740 --> 00:27:40,630
actually transitions in security and

707
00:27:40,630 --> 00:27:42,610
then I actually played with stuff and I

708
00:27:42,610 --> 00:27:44,350
learned the techniques and I understood

709
00:27:44,350 --> 00:27:46,630
it and but here's the thing becoming

710
00:27:46,630 --> 00:27:48,790
that adversary and yes this is the very

711
00:27:48,790 --> 00:27:52,510
typical overstock type of you know cyber

712
00:27:52,510 --> 00:27:56,440
criminal person yeah but before I

713
00:27:56,440 --> 00:27:58,900
develop that apps here and mindset I had

714
00:27:58,900 --> 00:28:00,280
to get some of the training that's where

715
00:28:00,280 --> 00:28:01,720
the training the training is hard

716
00:28:01,720 --> 00:28:04,360
because there's there's just so much out

717
00:28:04,360 --> 00:28:05,710
there this is this is actually what it

718
00:28:05,710 --> 00:28:07,810
looks like to find a training class on

719
00:28:07,810 --> 00:28:09,880
the internet you're sitting there and

720
00:28:09,880 --> 00:28:11,560
you're just getting blasted when it's

721
00:28:11,560 --> 00:28:14,200
YouTube whatever and there's just so

722
00:28:14,200 --> 00:28:17,050
many options out there so when I decided

723
00:28:17,050 --> 00:28:18,970
to look through that I actually want to

724
00:28:18,970 --> 00:28:22,000
get a dedicated course I I'm very much a

725
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:24,220
hands-on learner and so I ended up with

726
00:28:24,220 --> 00:28:26,290
hacker house and a hacker house was

727
00:28:26,290 --> 00:28:28,000
fantastic they gave me the foundational

728
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:30,940
skills I needed to understand well how

729
00:28:30,940 --> 00:28:33,790
web app contesting occurred but also how

730
00:28:33,790 --> 00:28:36,880
network pen testing occurred and by

731
00:28:36,880 --> 00:28:39,220
having both it gives me a really solid

732
00:28:39,220 --> 00:28:42,040
base or how I can protect the

733
00:28:42,040 --> 00:28:44,560
applications that I built but also what

734
00:28:44,560 --> 00:28:46,810
would happen if somebody actually got

735
00:28:46,810 --> 00:28:47,610
through

736
00:28:47,610 --> 00:28:50,549
with an adversary go from a web app into

737
00:28:50,549 --> 00:28:52,290
the network and then start moving along

738
00:28:52,290 --> 00:28:55,830
the network to critical assets having

739
00:28:55,830 --> 00:28:57,390
that mindset is what's going to allow

740
00:28:57,390 --> 00:29:00,990
you to become a better developer a more

741
00:29:00,990 --> 00:29:03,510
secure developer and I would urge you

742
00:29:03,510 --> 00:29:06,000
all to consider taking it some form of

743
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:07,520
course whether it's in person or

744
00:29:07,520 --> 00:29:09,720
something like I learned security that's

745
00:29:09,720 --> 00:29:12,600
online or if you have very deep pocket

746
00:29:12,600 --> 00:29:13,770
books you can go to Sam's they have

747
00:29:13,770 --> 00:29:16,530
which ear to ear a little pricey but

748
00:29:16,530 --> 00:29:19,860
their material is world-class I tend to

749
00:29:19,860 --> 00:29:21,480
also buy a lot of books and these are

750
00:29:21,480 --> 00:29:22,740
some of the books that I bet

751
00:29:22,740 --> 00:29:25,320
dramatically helped me the web

752
00:29:25,320 --> 00:29:28,610
application hacker's handbook from a

753
00:29:28,610 --> 00:29:30,929
from a developer perspective is probably

754
00:29:30,929 --> 00:29:33,540
the book that most people recommend and

755
00:29:33,540 --> 00:29:35,460
I have to say I agree it gives you the

756
00:29:35,460 --> 00:29:36,990
understanding of some of the vectors

757
00:29:36,990 --> 00:29:39,419
that these bad actors will look at to

758
00:29:39,419 --> 00:29:41,669
get into your systems and you know

759
00:29:41,669 --> 00:29:43,890
perpetually try to compromise you and

760
00:29:43,890 --> 00:29:45,059
they're gonna do it once you put a

761
00:29:45,059 --> 00:29:46,710
system out is going to be probed it's

762
00:29:46,710 --> 00:29:48,630
going to be people are going to try to

763
00:29:48,630 --> 00:29:53,280
get into your software now taking course

764
00:29:53,280 --> 00:29:56,010
reading a book that's all fine and dandy

765
00:29:56,010 --> 00:29:57,780
but you know what unless you are

766
00:29:57,780 --> 00:29:59,700
actually practicing your craft unless

767
00:29:59,700 --> 00:30:01,020
you are actually going out there and

768
00:30:01,020 --> 00:30:03,210
practicing these skill sets of how an

769
00:30:03,210 --> 00:30:05,880
adversary works you're not really going

770
00:30:05,880 --> 00:30:08,100
to get a feel for it and this is what I

771
00:30:08,100 --> 00:30:10,440
love about o Las Olas has taken the time

772
00:30:10,440 --> 00:30:14,460
to create materials tools and and in

773
00:30:14,460 --> 00:30:16,530
applications actually that you can

774
00:30:16,530 --> 00:30:19,020
happen you can hack illegally Olas you

775
00:30:19,020 --> 00:30:23,340
shop is an a node.js application using

776
00:30:23,340 --> 00:30:26,190
angular it's fantastic for testing out

777
00:30:26,190 --> 00:30:29,660
things like cross-site scripting its

778
00:30:29,660 --> 00:30:33,980
sequel injections request forgeries

779
00:30:33,980 --> 00:30:36,780
cookie is feeling cookies all that fun

780
00:30:36,780 --> 00:30:39,750
stuff that you would do as a web app pen

781
00:30:39,750 --> 00:30:42,090
tester and also as a cyber criminal and

782
00:30:42,090 --> 00:30:44,490
so I would urge you to take a look at

783
00:30:44,490 --> 00:30:48,390
the OSU shop project along with bead and

784
00:30:48,390 --> 00:30:50,580
vulnerable web application this is this

785
00:30:50,580 --> 00:30:52,650
is an oldie but goodie it's been around

786
00:30:52,650 --> 00:30:53,970
for a very long time but it's definitely

787
00:30:53,970 --> 00:30:57,270
worth looking at I'd also recommend if

788
00:30:57,270 --> 00:30:59,280
you're getting into more of dev setups

789
00:30:59,280 --> 00:31:01,110
to take a look at the

790
00:31:01,110 --> 00:31:02,880
Deathlok project this is another one

791
00:31:02,880 --> 00:31:05,850
that's really great for those who are it

792
00:31:05,850 --> 00:31:09,090
more into understanding how to secure

793
00:31:09,090 --> 00:31:11,400
the end to end of everything everything

794
00:31:11,400 --> 00:31:13,920
from the code but also to the CI to the

795
00:31:13,920 --> 00:31:15,720
deployment things like that enough for

796
00:31:15,720 --> 00:31:17,790
deaf subset ops comes in and I think

797
00:31:17,790 --> 00:31:20,280
it's really important that we consider

798
00:31:20,280 --> 00:31:22,380
how all those components tying together

799
00:31:22,380 --> 00:31:24,660
how do you how do you actually protect

800
00:31:24,660 --> 00:31:26,190
code but then once you get it out of

801
00:31:26,190 --> 00:31:28,260
your developers hands how do you

802
00:31:28,260 --> 00:31:30,590
administer identity access rights

803
00:31:30,590 --> 00:31:33,120
deployment rights who have who can touch

804
00:31:33,120 --> 00:31:35,669
code once it's been approved and audited

805
00:31:35,669 --> 00:31:38,730
through your CI CD all those things come

806
00:31:38,730 --> 00:31:40,380
into play and that's where def sec Ops

807
00:31:40,380 --> 00:31:43,140
is really critical but one thing I will

808
00:31:43,140 --> 00:31:45,059
say is that if you decide that you want

809
00:31:45,059 --> 00:31:47,520
to get into security build a very strong

810
00:31:47,520 --> 00:31:50,160
network it's I know it's easier said

811
00:31:50,160 --> 00:31:51,390
than done and a lot of folks will say

812
00:31:51,390 --> 00:31:52,799
well what do you mean you build a

813
00:31:52,799 --> 00:31:55,110
network you know I why should I do that

814
00:31:55,110 --> 00:31:57,090
I just want to code I think it's

815
00:31:57,090 --> 00:31:58,590
critically important to build that

816
00:31:58,590 --> 00:32:00,630
network of people who have an

817
00:32:00,630 --> 00:32:02,190
understanding of the areas that you

818
00:32:02,190 --> 00:32:04,530
don't especially in terms of security

819
00:32:04,530 --> 00:32:06,540
and that's how I was able to transition

820
00:32:06,540 --> 00:32:08,400
I reached out to a lot of people I never

821
00:32:08,400 --> 00:32:10,440
met and just ask them for advice I

822
00:32:10,440 --> 00:32:12,240
wanted to understand the things that

823
00:32:12,240 --> 00:32:13,919
were important to them the things that

824
00:32:13,919 --> 00:32:16,370
they saw in the security landscape

825
00:32:16,370 --> 00:32:18,720
it was critically it was quickly

826
00:32:18,720 --> 00:32:20,160
important me for do that for me to do

827
00:32:20,160 --> 00:32:21,900
that but also it was very valuable

828
00:32:21,900 --> 00:32:23,280
because I met a lot of folks that were

829
00:32:23,280 --> 00:32:26,130
way smarter than me but taught me taught

830
00:32:26,130 --> 00:32:27,900
me some of the ropes and pointed me in

831
00:32:27,900 --> 00:32:29,429
the right direction so I would say that

832
00:32:29,429 --> 00:32:31,710
reach out to people in the security

833
00:32:31,710 --> 00:32:34,590
space who are doing the things that you

834
00:32:34,590 --> 00:32:36,630
would like to do and then learn from

835
00:32:36,630 --> 00:32:38,850
them and for those in leadership

836
00:32:38,850 --> 00:32:42,240
positions that are hiring don't assume

837
00:32:42,240 --> 00:32:44,990
that you have to hire a security person

838
00:32:44,990 --> 00:32:47,669
look for non-traditional talent people

839
00:32:47,669 --> 00:32:50,880
who you see have tenacity or have a very

840
00:32:50,880 --> 00:32:52,740
special set of skills skills that can

841
00:32:52,740 --> 00:32:54,750
translate over into a security world

842
00:32:54,750 --> 00:32:56,760
very easily and that was kind of what

843
00:32:56,760 --> 00:32:58,290
happened with me I had this this

844
00:32:58,290 --> 00:33:02,390
developer experience and and Johnson the

845
00:33:02,390 --> 00:33:05,460
person who hired me at Microsoft she saw

846
00:33:05,460 --> 00:33:09,630
something in that had potential and I

847
00:33:09,630 --> 00:33:12,240
had no security experience but she she

848
00:33:12,240 --> 00:33:13,010
gave me some

849
00:33:13,010 --> 00:33:14,690
some things to do she said look I want

850
00:33:14,690 --> 00:33:17,060
to see progress on these things show me

851
00:33:17,060 --> 00:33:18,260
you can do it and then we can talk

852
00:33:18,260 --> 00:33:20,900
enough and I went out there but had I

853
00:33:20,900 --> 00:33:23,210
not had somebody who could see the

854
00:33:23,210 --> 00:33:26,090
potential in a non-traditional person I

855
00:33:26,090 --> 00:33:29,090
might not be in security today and so I

856
00:33:29,090 --> 00:33:31,640
would urge you all if you're a hiring

857
00:33:31,640 --> 00:33:34,580
manager to please consider folks in

858
00:33:34,580 --> 00:33:36,290
non-traditional roles give them the

859
00:33:36,290 --> 00:33:38,720
opportunity to look at their skills and

860
00:33:38,720 --> 00:33:41,540
figure out where do they fit the bottom

861
00:33:41,540 --> 00:33:43,280
line is though when it comes to security

862
00:33:43,280 --> 00:33:45,890
if you really want to do well then you

863
00:33:45,890 --> 00:33:48,290
got this it takes some effort it's not

864
00:33:48,290 --> 00:33:49,780
something is going to happen overnight

865
00:33:49,780 --> 00:33:52,900
shifting left doesn't happen overnight

866
00:33:52,900 --> 00:33:55,190
embracing different tools doesn't happen

867
00:33:55,190 --> 00:33:57,770
overnight auditing all your code doesn't

868
00:33:57,770 --> 00:33:59,630
happen overnight but if you take the

869
00:33:59,630 --> 00:34:01,400
time to really think it through and come

870
00:34:01,400 --> 00:34:04,400
up with a good plan and capitalize on

871
00:34:04,400 --> 00:34:05,960
the experience of security professionals

872
00:34:05,960 --> 00:34:07,970
and security companies have already been

873
00:34:07,970 --> 00:34:10,040
there done that you can get yourself

874
00:34:10,040 --> 00:34:12,340
into a really solid secure position

875
00:34:12,340 --> 00:34:15,080
substantially quicker look at services

876
00:34:15,080 --> 00:34:16,668
like secure code warrior look at

877
00:34:16,668 --> 00:34:20,629
services like neat white source github

878
00:34:20,629 --> 00:34:23,418
all these systems are in place not only

879
00:34:23,418 --> 00:34:25,940
to train you but also to secure your

880
00:34:25,940 --> 00:34:28,280
code base and with that I thank you very

881
00:34:28,280 --> 00:34:30,350
much or allow me to give this

882
00:34:30,350 --> 00:34:32,750
presentation yeah that was that was a

883
00:34:32,750 --> 00:34:34,909
great tour there array huh I feel like

884
00:34:34,909 --> 00:34:36,918
you really consumed a lot of resources

885
00:34:36,918 --> 00:34:38,360
in your short time and secured to you

886
00:34:38,360 --> 00:34:39,560
how long have you been at this in the

887
00:34:39,560 --> 00:34:40,850
security function a year year and a half

888
00:34:40,850 --> 00:34:43,850
I think I just I'm gonna be complaining

889
00:34:43,850 --> 00:34:45,918
two years in this so yeah there was a

890
00:34:45,918 --> 00:34:48,379
lot of sleepless nights yeah that was

891
00:34:48,379 --> 00:34:49,940
great yeah so thanks for sharing let me

892
00:34:49,940 --> 00:34:51,260
just check the chat real quick I think

893
00:34:51,260 --> 00:34:53,210
any questions for Ray he's got a couple

894
00:34:53,210 --> 00:34:54,429
minutes here you might be able to answer

895
00:34:54,429 --> 00:34:57,680
that developer perspective on joining

896
00:34:57,680 --> 00:35:00,290
the security function I thought that was

897
00:35:00,290 --> 00:35:01,310
interesting that you mentioned looking

898
00:35:01,310 --> 00:35:03,800
for for development talent maybe outside

899
00:35:03,800 --> 00:35:05,750
of the normal security functions I think

900
00:35:05,750 --> 00:35:07,130
that's a great recommendation for

901
00:35:07,130 --> 00:35:08,420
security teams that's an easy way to

902
00:35:08,420 --> 00:35:10,040
bridge that gap right you can get a

903
00:35:10,040 --> 00:35:12,350
developer you don't have to be the most

904
00:35:12,350 --> 00:35:13,580
senior developer but just somebody with

905
00:35:13,580 --> 00:35:14,960
you know that tooling in that

906
00:35:14,960 --> 00:35:15,920
environment that they're used to working

907
00:35:15,920 --> 00:35:19,130
bringing on the security team it is and

908
00:35:19,130 --> 00:35:20,870
it's interesting because I think so many

909
00:35:20,870 --> 00:35:23,180
people get hung up on experience

910
00:35:23,180 --> 00:35:24,720
experience experience

911
00:35:24,720 --> 00:35:26,280
yeah experience is definitely valuable I

912
00:35:26,280 --> 00:35:27,480
don't want to dismiss that but I think

913
00:35:27,480 --> 00:35:29,640
it's also important to I understand that

914
00:35:29,640 --> 00:35:31,470
there's a gap of three million cyber

915
00:35:31,470 --> 00:35:32,900
security professionals in this work and

916
00:35:32,900 --> 00:35:35,369
hey in the world there's there's that

917
00:35:35,369 --> 00:35:38,250
need and so you're not going to find

918
00:35:38,250 --> 00:35:40,829
three million people who are have ten

919
00:35:40,829 --> 00:35:42,540
years of experience in cyber security

920
00:35:42,540 --> 00:35:44,579
that are just ready to go the people are

921
00:35:44,579 --> 00:35:47,069
really good or hire and get either

922
00:35:47,069 --> 00:35:48,930
you're gonna throw a boatload of money

923
00:35:48,930 --> 00:35:52,050
at them or you're gonna you're gonna

924
00:35:52,050 --> 00:35:54,960
have to look for other avenues to get

925
00:35:54,960 --> 00:35:56,640
people up to a level that you need and

926
00:35:56,640 --> 00:35:59,099
there's so many great training resources

927
00:35:59,099 --> 00:36:02,010
nowadays that you can take somebody who

928
00:36:02,010 --> 00:36:04,470
is a software developer who maybe has

929
00:36:04,470 --> 00:36:06,660
some of the DevOps experience and and

930
00:36:06,660 --> 00:36:10,470
say please go learn and help us and I

931
00:36:10,470 --> 00:36:12,540
think what ends up happening is that a

932
00:36:12,540 --> 00:36:14,700
lot of companies feel like there's an

933
00:36:14,700 --> 00:36:16,829
inherent risk in training somebody you

934
00:36:16,829 --> 00:36:18,660
train somebody to get them really good

935
00:36:18,660 --> 00:36:21,150
and they leave you and that's a risk any

936
00:36:21,150 --> 00:36:24,000
time you know it is what it is but I

937
00:36:24,000 --> 00:36:25,290
think ultimately if you train somebody

938
00:36:25,290 --> 00:36:26,700
who treat them well and you treat them

939
00:36:26,700 --> 00:36:29,880
professionally you know you you minimize

940
00:36:29,880 --> 00:36:31,760
that risk if somebody's going to leave

941
00:36:31,760 --> 00:36:34,770
you know I I'm going on almost ten years

942
00:36:34,770 --> 00:36:38,369
now at Microsoft and so I I know that's

943
00:36:38,369 --> 00:36:40,380
I'm probably like a uniform because I

944
00:36:40,380 --> 00:36:41,400
don't think most people stay that long

945
00:36:41,400 --> 00:36:44,040
you know but we do have a lot of people

946
00:36:44,040 --> 00:36:46,319
that have been in Microsoft for a very

947
00:36:46,319 --> 00:36:48,150
long time some in excess of twenty years

948
00:36:48,150 --> 00:36:50,130
and the reason is because if companies

949
00:36:50,130 --> 00:36:53,190
treat you well they invest in you they

950
00:36:53,190 --> 00:36:56,430
invest in training that's where people

951
00:36:56,430 --> 00:37:00,150
decide to stay so I know I hope that's

952
00:37:00,150 --> 00:37:02,579
not a fear that people have I would say

953
00:37:02,579 --> 00:37:05,579
it's rich it's worth more to invest in

954
00:37:05,579 --> 00:37:08,579
your people and make sure that they have

955
00:37:08,579 --> 00:37:10,410
the skills to help you do what you need

956
00:37:10,410 --> 00:37:12,240
to do in a securities one of them find

957
00:37:12,240 --> 00:37:14,790
that person who has a passion for it and

958
00:37:14,790 --> 00:37:15,780
there are a lot of people that have

959
00:37:15,780 --> 00:37:17,430
approached me and said I want to go in

960
00:37:17,430 --> 00:37:20,310
security how do I do it just invest in

961
00:37:20,310 --> 00:37:24,089
them give it a shot and the dailies so

962
00:37:24,089 --> 00:37:25,440
you mentioned you mentioned the OWASP

963
00:37:25,440 --> 00:37:28,349
the top ten you mentioned the juice shop

964
00:37:28,349 --> 00:37:30,359
project you also mentioned the hacker

965
00:37:30,359 --> 00:37:32,790
house as a resource for skilling up so

966
00:37:32,790 --> 00:37:35,010
yeah for any of that I think they could

967
00:37:35,010 --> 00:37:36,329
also follow you on twitter it looks like

968
00:37:36,329 --> 00:37:37,619
a couple people do

969
00:37:37,619 --> 00:37:39,450
so they're probably dropping resources

970
00:37:39,450 --> 00:37:40,950
here and there on how to get skilled up

971
00:37:40,950 --> 00:37:42,269
from it from a dam to a security

972
00:37:42,269 --> 00:37:45,539
perspective I do I try my best and I

973
00:37:45,539 --> 00:37:48,269
actually wrote an article on ethical

974
00:37:48,269 --> 00:37:50,430
ethical hacker net and so I have a

975
00:37:50,430 --> 00:37:52,710
column there and I have written quite a

976
00:37:52,710 --> 00:37:54,240
while I had to write some more I just

977
00:37:54,240 --> 00:37:55,680
dropped an article recently and it's

978
00:37:55,680 --> 00:37:57,900
going to be a thorough process but as I

979
00:37:57,900 --> 00:37:59,700
become better and more experienced in

980
00:37:59,700 --> 00:38:02,700
cybersecurity it's it's interesting to

981
00:38:02,700 --> 00:38:06,950
see the disconnect that we have between

982
00:38:06,950 --> 00:38:09,329
what management perceives and when I say

983
00:38:09,329 --> 00:38:12,299
management and I say developers and and

984
00:38:12,299 --> 00:38:14,579
ops if because there is this big

985
00:38:14,579 --> 00:38:15,839
disconnect everybody thinks there are

986
00:38:15,839 --> 00:38:17,519
silos buckets and they don't want to

987
00:38:17,519 --> 00:38:20,549
talk and it's still pervasive I think

988
00:38:20,549 --> 00:38:21,900
smaller companies have means your time

989
00:38:21,900 --> 00:38:23,700
because they don't have that many people

990
00:38:23,700 --> 00:38:25,289
and so people just want to talk with

991
00:38:25,289 --> 00:38:26,700
each other when you're in larger

992
00:38:26,700 --> 00:38:28,650
companies there's these big silos and

993
00:38:28,650 --> 00:38:30,269
breaking down those silos and having

994
00:38:30,269 --> 00:38:32,249
security champions who can communicate

995
00:38:32,249 --> 00:38:34,319
with each other on on terms that they

996
00:38:34,319 --> 00:38:37,079
both relate to that's a huge thing

997
00:38:37,079 --> 00:38:40,259
that's amusing awesome well thank you

998
00:38:40,259 --> 00:38:41,549
spent all this time with us here at this

999
00:38:41,549 --> 00:38:43,470
icon 24 and it was great information

1000
00:38:43,470 --> 00:38:45,539
thanks for sharing all that my pleasure

1001
00:38:45,539 --> 00:38:46,829
and thank you for having me this has

1002
00:38:46,829 --> 00:38:48,809
been great I had a great day to

1003
00:38:48,809 --> 00:38:50,430
everybody and hopefully this is a dollar

1004
00:38:50,430 --> 00:38:52,730
deal
