very much welcome everybody to the first

19
00:00:46,050 --> 00:00:48,870
ignite which is obviously mine and the

20
00:00:48,870 --> 00:00:50,850
title of my ignite is going DevOps why

21
00:00:50,850 --> 00:00:53,039
top-down or bottom-up might be the wrong

22
00:00:53,039 --> 00:00:55,140
question at the beginning of a

23
00:00:55,140 --> 00:00:58,140
transition or your way to DevOps or dev

24
00:00:58,140 --> 00:01:01,109
SEC many greetings from Kea my name is

25
00:01:01,109 --> 00:01:02,730
Sabina vishesha and together with my

26
00:01:02,730 --> 00:01:04,830
husband Mike we are running yet next IT

27
00:01:04,830 --> 00:01:07,740
and would get next IT we help people on

28
00:01:07,740 --> 00:01:10,229
the way to become more agile or to go to

29
00:01:10,229 --> 00:01:12,720
being DevOps so that's a very

30
00:01:12,720 --> 00:01:16,049
interesting topic the first time I

31
00:01:16,049 --> 00:01:18,950
entered the international stage of

32
00:01:18,950 --> 00:01:23,030
speaking at DevOps days was 2015 and

33
00:01:23,030 --> 00:01:26,520
from this time one question came along

34
00:01:26,520 --> 00:01:28,350
my way again and again and again and

35
00:01:28,350 --> 00:01:31,040
this is how what is the best approach to

36
00:01:31,040 --> 00:01:34,439
yeah implement DevOps top-down or

37
00:01:34,439 --> 00:01:36,570
bottom-up and for me the whole question

38
00:01:36,570 --> 00:01:40,439
feels somehow wrong but I didn't know

39
00:01:40,439 --> 00:01:43,470
why it felt so wrong so I started my

40
00:01:43,470 --> 00:01:45,960
journey to discover what is wrong with

41
00:01:45,960 --> 00:01:48,659
the question I found out that all the

42
00:01:48,659 --> 00:01:51,780
answers of is it better to go top-down

43
00:01:51,780 --> 00:01:55,979
or bottom-up absolutely right and true

44
00:01:55,979 --> 00:01:59,399
from the points of view and so yeah I

45
00:01:59,399 --> 00:02:02,100
had a look at the top-down advocates and

46
00:02:02,100 --> 00:02:04,500
they say we need the top the top

47
00:02:04,500 --> 00:02:06,570
management to support the DevOps

48
00:02:06,570 --> 00:02:09,598
initiatives because this costs money it

49
00:02:09,598 --> 00:02:11,240
costs time and

50
00:02:11,240 --> 00:02:13,520
if they do not support it we will not

51
00:02:13,520 --> 00:02:15,860
make it but we also have the bottom up

52
00:02:15,860 --> 00:02:18,920
proponents and they say okay it costs

53
00:02:18,920 --> 00:02:21,170
time and customary but we need the

54
00:02:21,170 --> 00:02:24,260
people at the bottom to do the DevOps

55
00:02:24,260 --> 00:02:26,780
style to implement the whole culture

56
00:02:26,780 --> 00:02:29,660
without them it does not work and we had

57
00:02:29,660 --> 00:02:32,090
the third party the I it depends

58
00:02:32,090 --> 00:02:34,250
champions and to be honest I'm more the

59
00:02:34,250 --> 00:02:37,040
it depends style and they say just take

60
00:02:37,040 --> 00:02:39,680
a look and look how the company and the

61
00:02:39,680 --> 00:02:42,050
teams are working and then we can find

62
00:02:42,050 --> 00:02:44,350
out what's better top-down or bottom-up

63
00:02:44,350 --> 00:02:47,120
but still it was not the right thing for

64
00:02:47,120 --> 00:02:50,540
me and I started to step back and had a

65
00:02:50,540 --> 00:02:53,270
look on what's the goal of doing DevOps

66
00:02:53,270 --> 00:02:56,540
and we have a left of different goals

67
00:02:56,540 --> 00:02:59,270
but I picked just out some three of it

68
00:02:59,270 --> 00:03:01,340
on the one hand we want to build better

69
00:03:01,340 --> 00:03:03,950
products we want to build in a better

70
00:03:03,950 --> 00:03:07,580
quality but in the end it's about happy

71
00:03:07,580 --> 00:03:10,190
customers delivering value to them

72
00:03:10,190 --> 00:03:12,950
delivering benefits to them put them in

73
00:03:12,950 --> 00:03:16,310
the center of whatever we do so what do

74
00:03:16,310 --> 00:03:20,810
we need to make our customers happy what

75
00:03:20,810 --> 00:03:23,300
do we as a company as a team need to

76
00:03:23,300 --> 00:03:25,940
make them happy and then the fast

77
00:03:25,940 --> 00:03:29,300
changing times we have some special

78
00:03:29,300 --> 00:03:31,340
needs and one of these needs is to get

79
00:03:31,340 --> 00:03:34,910
rid of silos because silos slow down the

80
00:03:34,910 --> 00:03:37,550
whole process and silos don't help with

81
00:03:37,550 --> 00:03:40,700
interdisciplinary communication and yeah

82
00:03:40,700 --> 00:03:43,100
continuous improvement so the first

83
00:03:43,100 --> 00:03:45,110
thing is get out here it off silos the

84
00:03:45,110 --> 00:03:47,870
second thing is eliminate the blame game

85
00:03:47,870 --> 00:03:50,600
machinery because blaming each other

86
00:03:50,600 --> 00:03:53,780
does not help to improve we want to

87
00:03:53,780 --> 00:03:56,030
learn we want also to learn out of

88
00:03:56,030 --> 00:03:59,110
failure and we want to learn fast and

89
00:03:59,110 --> 00:04:01,880
for this we need to found the

90
00:04:01,880 --> 00:04:04,160
communication and the decision-making at

91
00:04:04,160 --> 00:04:07,360
eye level so we can talk about different

92
00:04:07,360 --> 00:04:09,950
hierarchy levels different positions in

93
00:04:09,950 --> 00:04:12,650
an open transparent way without blaming

94
00:04:12,650 --> 00:04:15,380
without getting stuck in the silos but

95
00:04:15,380 --> 00:04:17,899
with asking what is better top-down or

96
00:04:17,899 --> 00:04:21,410
bottom-up we implicitly build silos we

97
00:04:21,410 --> 00:04:23,450
implicitly built hierarchy and we

98
00:04:23,450 --> 00:04:24,440
implicitly

99
00:04:24,440 --> 00:04:28,040
we versus you depending on your point of

100
00:04:28,040 --> 00:04:32,210
view so also this question what is

101
00:04:32,210 --> 00:04:34,310
better implicitly

102
00:04:34,310 --> 00:04:37,400
has the chance for blaming if we are at

103
00:04:37,400 --> 00:04:38,780
the top and we start the top-down

104
00:04:38,780 --> 00:04:41,480
approach and it does not work we can say

105
00:04:41,480 --> 00:04:43,940
okay it's not a power failure it's their

106
00:04:43,940 --> 00:04:45,650
failure because they are at the bottom

107
00:04:45,650 --> 00:04:49,040
and what about the people in the middle

108
00:04:49,040 --> 00:04:51,140
we all know when we want to do a

109
00:04:51,140 --> 00:04:53,870
transition in the company the people in

110
00:04:53,870 --> 00:04:56,480
the middle are extremely important for

111
00:04:56,480 --> 00:04:58,220
making it work that all the

112
00:04:58,220 --> 00:05:00,590
communication can work along the whole

113
00:05:00,590 --> 00:05:03,830
stream and we can come to a stronger we

114
00:05:03,830 --> 00:05:06,140
and I think this is the most important

115
00:05:06,140 --> 00:05:09,110
thing we need to have a strong we to

116
00:05:09,110 --> 00:05:11,840
come closer to DevOps to dev SEC or

117
00:05:11,840 --> 00:05:15,200
whatever you want to do and therefore we

118
00:05:15,200 --> 00:05:17,420
should ask the more beautiful questions

119
00:05:17,420 --> 00:05:21,230
what do we want to achieve together what

120
00:05:21,230 --> 00:05:25,070
do we need to achieve it and how can we

121
00:05:25,070 --> 00:05:31,010
do it together so it's about we and when

122
00:05:31,010 --> 00:05:33,430
you want to start asked who should start

123
00:05:33,430 --> 00:05:36,440
and I can say it's you start with

124
00:05:36,440 --> 00:05:38,870
yourself and be the change in the whole

125
00:05:38,870 --> 00:05:41,180
company be the first one who asked the

126
00:05:41,180 --> 00:05:43,880
question question what should we do

127
00:05:43,880 --> 00:05:47,240
thank you very much thank you sir man

128
00:05:47,240 --> 00:05:50,720
that was a quick one and a lot of a lot

129
00:05:50,720 --> 00:05:53,770
of agile there yes

130
00:05:53,770 --> 00:05:58,010
all righty I hope you enjoyed it we sure

131
00:05:58,010 --> 00:06:00,280
did
