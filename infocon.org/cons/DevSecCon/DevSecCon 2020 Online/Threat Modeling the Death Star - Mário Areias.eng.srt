1
00:00:01,040 --> 00:00:03,520
uh hello everyone welcome to my talk

2
00:00:03,520 --> 00:00:05,520
try them all in the dev style just a

3
00:00:05,520 --> 00:00:06,960
quick introduction

4
00:00:06,960 --> 00:00:10,240
uh mario i'm a software security guy

5
00:00:10,240 --> 00:00:12,240
i used to be a developer for over 10

6
00:00:12,240 --> 00:00:14,400
years the last few years

7
00:00:14,400 --> 00:00:16,640
i moved to a secure full-time security

8
00:00:16,640 --> 00:00:18,000
position

9
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:20,880
i just recently joined canva as a

10
00:00:20,880 --> 00:00:23,199
security engineer

11
00:00:23,199 --> 00:00:24,400
today we're going to talk about

12
00:00:24,400 --> 00:00:26,560
treadmilling and devstar

13
00:00:26,560 --> 00:00:29,599
but that comes in a second and and

14
00:00:29,599 --> 00:00:30,720
treadmilling is a

15
00:00:30,720 --> 00:00:34,239
subject that's very um dear to my heart

16
00:00:34,239 --> 00:00:37,200
for different reasons but one of them is

17
00:00:37,200 --> 00:00:38,719
well stated by

18
00:00:38,719 --> 00:00:41,280
the devops support state of the hope

19
00:00:41,280 --> 00:00:42,000
support

20
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:45,120
from last year it's a report that's like

21
00:00:45,120 --> 00:00:47,600
generated by puppets and some other

22
00:00:47,600 --> 00:00:48,320
companies

23
00:00:48,320 --> 00:00:50,480
uh they interview a lot of people in

24
00:00:50,480 --> 00:00:51,920
different companies

25
00:00:51,920 --> 00:00:54,160
and as anything devops they also have a

26
00:00:54,160 --> 00:00:56,480
section about security

27
00:00:56,480 --> 00:00:58,559
and the interesting thing is what they

28
00:00:58,559 --> 00:01:00,719
found is the security and development

29
00:01:00,719 --> 00:01:03,039
things collaborate on thread models

30
00:01:03,039 --> 00:01:04,959
is the most effective way to improve

31
00:01:04,959 --> 00:01:06,560
security posture

32
00:01:06,560 --> 00:01:10,000
and i believe that uh 100 that matches

33
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:11,200
my experience

34
00:01:11,200 --> 00:01:14,880
as well so um yeah that's why i think

35
00:01:14,880 --> 00:01:15,600
treadmill

36
00:01:15,600 --> 00:01:18,479
is quite important and then can you put

37
00:01:18,479 --> 00:01:20,080
the organization to the next level when

38
00:01:20,080 --> 00:01:22,400
it comes to secure posture

39
00:01:22,400 --> 00:01:23,680
but then we talk about like trade

40
00:01:23,680 --> 00:01:25,040
modeling right there are many

41
00:01:25,040 --> 00:01:26,960
definitions of treadmilling

42
00:01:26,960 --> 00:01:29,280
and one of them is like uh treadmilling

43
00:01:29,280 --> 00:01:30,400
is a process to

44
00:01:30,400 --> 00:01:34,079
identify enumerate threats right it's

45
00:01:34,079 --> 00:01:37,840
straight one like us very to the point

46
00:01:37,840 --> 00:01:41,280
but it's not very engaging like

47
00:01:41,280 --> 00:01:43,119
even chewbacca is not very impressed

48
00:01:43,119 --> 00:01:45,680
right like it's really hard to get

49
00:01:45,680 --> 00:01:46,320
people

50
00:01:46,320 --> 00:01:48,320
to buy in when it comes to treadmilling

51
00:01:48,320 --> 00:01:50,880
like they're people who are not security

52
00:01:50,880 --> 00:01:52,159
and then we talk about like a

53
00:01:52,159 --> 00:01:54,399
collaborative process so they need to

54
00:01:54,399 --> 00:01:56,240
have buying

55
00:01:56,240 --> 00:01:59,520
so that was me a few years ago when i

56
00:01:59,520 --> 00:02:00,320
was trying like

57
00:02:00,320 --> 00:02:03,759
trying to um introduce threat modeling

58
00:02:03,759 --> 00:02:05,280
to a company that was working at the

59
00:02:05,280 --> 00:02:08,399
time and i was having this issue where

60
00:02:08,399 --> 00:02:10,959
like treadmilling i felt i was so very

61
00:02:10,959 --> 00:02:11,920
important

62
00:02:11,920 --> 00:02:14,560
but was really hard to get buying uh of

63
00:02:14,560 --> 00:02:15,920
like developers

64
00:02:15,920 --> 00:02:18,480
or product managers anyone like that's

65
00:02:18,480 --> 00:02:19,760
actually doing a good job

66
00:02:19,760 --> 00:02:23,440
building software so i started to study

67
00:02:23,440 --> 00:02:25,760
a lot and i came up with a list of

68
00:02:25,760 --> 00:02:26,720
requirements

69
00:02:26,720 --> 00:02:28,400
what i wanted to get from my

70
00:02:28,400 --> 00:02:29,920
treadmilling process

71
00:02:29,920 --> 00:02:33,519
which was really important for me

72
00:02:33,519 --> 00:02:36,239
and for me it was very very important to

73
00:02:36,239 --> 00:02:36,800
be like

74
00:02:36,800 --> 00:02:38,400
threatened only should be engaging

75
00:02:38,400 --> 00:02:41,360
exercise i didn't want to have another

76
00:02:41,360 --> 00:02:42,480
process

77
00:02:42,480 --> 00:02:45,440
where uh it's boring people are

78
00:02:45,440 --> 00:02:47,280
attending they are not having like

79
00:02:47,280 --> 00:02:48,959
fun they are not engaged they are not

80
00:02:48,959 --> 00:02:51,200
because it's it's uh it's not very good

81
00:02:51,200 --> 00:02:54,080
so that was my first requirement my

82
00:02:54,080 --> 00:02:55,920
second requirement it needs to be highly

83
00:02:55,920 --> 00:02:57,440
collaborative

84
00:02:57,440 --> 00:03:00,080
um and then again because i strongly

85
00:03:00,080 --> 00:03:00,480
feel

86
00:03:00,480 --> 00:03:02,560
like strata modeling is a process people

87
00:03:02,560 --> 00:03:04,239
need to collaborate together

88
00:03:04,239 --> 00:03:06,879
development and security to get like

89
00:03:06,879 --> 00:03:08,080
with a good result

90
00:03:08,080 --> 00:03:11,200
so for me from day one a a process where

91
00:03:11,200 --> 00:03:12,560
the security team builds

92
00:03:12,560 --> 00:03:14,319
the treadmill you just report back to

93
00:03:14,319 --> 00:03:17,120
the development teams is not good enough

94
00:03:17,120 --> 00:03:19,280
and finally you need to be valuable for

95
00:03:19,280 --> 00:03:20,560
everyone in the room

96
00:03:20,560 --> 00:03:22,080
so if you are trying to get

97
00:03:22,080 --> 00:03:23,920
collaboration from the people

98
00:03:23,920 --> 00:03:27,680
it needs to be uh valuable for them

99
00:03:27,680 --> 00:03:29,760
right so that was like my whole set of

100
00:03:29,760 --> 00:03:31,599
requirements when i was trying to look

101
00:03:31,599 --> 00:03:34,319
at i tried the modding process

102
00:03:34,319 --> 00:03:36,959
and i look at ver various different

103
00:03:36,959 --> 00:03:39,280
process i look a stride i look at pasta

104
00:03:39,280 --> 00:03:40,159
i look at red i

105
00:03:40,159 --> 00:03:43,120
read lots of books um but what i liked

106
00:03:43,120 --> 00:03:43,760
the most

107
00:03:43,760 --> 00:03:46,959
was attack trees i think cover the three

108
00:03:46,959 --> 00:03:49,840
the three of them so i did a pilot in

109
00:03:49,840 --> 00:03:51,360
that company

110
00:03:51,360 --> 00:03:54,640
uh with a few developers and what i came

111
00:03:54,640 --> 00:03:55,360
up with

112
00:03:55,360 --> 00:03:58,720
uh was a process and i released the

113
00:03:58,720 --> 00:04:00,560
process to them and then they did

114
00:04:00,560 --> 00:04:01,120
survive

115
00:04:01,120 --> 00:04:02,959
to get results so it's like how would

116
00:04:02,959 --> 00:04:05,439
you feel with that process

117
00:04:05,439 --> 00:04:07,200
and the results were very exciting at

118
00:04:07,200 --> 00:04:09,360
the time because then again my like

119
00:04:09,360 --> 00:04:11,840
bar was i just wanted them to like the

120
00:04:11,840 --> 00:04:14,080
process they don't need like to love it

121
00:04:14,080 --> 00:04:15,840
but as soon as i release the process i

122
00:04:15,840 --> 00:04:18,079
got like very interesting feedback

123
00:04:18,079 --> 00:04:21,120
80 of developers found useful some

124
00:04:21,120 --> 00:04:23,759
found valuable and almost everyone

125
00:04:23,759 --> 00:04:25,280
wanted to participate it again

126
00:04:25,280 --> 00:04:26,720
and this is really really important

127
00:04:26,720 --> 00:04:29,199
because the process that you want to run

128
00:04:29,199 --> 00:04:31,280
a lot of times through the company so

129
00:04:31,280 --> 00:04:32,479
they need to see value

130
00:04:32,479 --> 00:04:35,280
they need to want to participate again

131
00:04:35,280 --> 00:04:36,880
so from now on i'm going to use

132
00:04:36,880 --> 00:04:40,960
star wars as a methodology to explain

133
00:04:40,960 --> 00:04:42,479
what the process are released at the

134
00:04:42,479 --> 00:04:44,320
company

135
00:04:44,320 --> 00:04:47,759
so let's go to it star wars

136
00:04:47,759 --> 00:04:51,840
and that story starts with you watching

137
00:04:51,840 --> 00:04:54,960
you just became the chief security

138
00:04:54,960 --> 00:04:57,199
officer of the galactic empire

139
00:04:57,199 --> 00:05:00,000
well done you start with a low rank

140
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:01,280
storm trooper

141
00:05:01,280 --> 00:05:03,360
fighting the trenches and you made a

142
00:05:03,360 --> 00:05:04,880
hollow way to the top

143
00:05:04,880 --> 00:05:07,360
so now we're at sea level executive and

144
00:05:07,360 --> 00:05:08,000
then you

145
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:10,160
overview the whole uh security of the

146
00:05:10,160 --> 00:05:11,280
galactic empire

147
00:05:11,280 --> 00:05:12,960
that's a really important position i'm

148
00:05:12,960 --> 00:05:14,720
really proud of you

149
00:05:14,720 --> 00:05:18,160
but not everything's perfect right

150
00:05:18,160 --> 00:05:22,000
this guy he's your boss now

151
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:26,160
and you know he's a different kind of

152
00:05:26,160 --> 00:05:27,680
leader

153
00:05:27,680 --> 00:05:30,000
um you know this whole thing about like

154
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:31,360
servant leadership

155
00:05:31,360 --> 00:05:34,080
blameless culture he's not quite into

156
00:05:34,080 --> 00:05:34,560
that

157
00:05:34,560 --> 00:05:36,720
he's more like a high accountability

158
00:05:36,720 --> 00:05:38,320
kind of person let's say that

159
00:05:38,320 --> 00:05:40,800
right but you are very good at what you

160
00:05:40,800 --> 00:05:42,400
do so i'm pretty sure you're gonna be

161
00:05:42,400 --> 00:05:43,360
okay

162
00:05:43,360 --> 00:05:46,560
um and that's your first uh job as chief

163
00:05:46,560 --> 00:05:47,840
security officer

164
00:05:47,840 --> 00:05:49,280
you need to look what's the most

165
00:05:49,280 --> 00:05:51,199
important asset for the empire

166
00:05:51,199 --> 00:05:54,240
right luckily it's very easy to find

167
00:05:54,240 --> 00:05:55,600
because it's huge

168
00:05:55,600 --> 00:05:59,280
right it's def stop it's incredible big

169
00:05:59,280 --> 00:06:02,000
like spaceship that can like destroy

170
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:02,960
planets

171
00:06:02,960 --> 00:06:06,000
they have been spending two trillion

172
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:09,600
credits uh building this this spaceship

173
00:06:09,600 --> 00:06:12,720
they also was spent like 20 years

174
00:06:12,720 --> 00:06:16,319
in the making right uh so the leadership

175
00:06:16,319 --> 00:06:18,560
is very anxious about like deliver that

176
00:06:18,560 --> 00:06:19,680
to production

177
00:06:19,680 --> 00:06:21,360
and release that and start to use the

178
00:06:21,360 --> 00:06:23,600
weapon but any waterfall

179
00:06:23,600 --> 00:06:26,960
project is overdue and over budget

180
00:06:26,960 --> 00:06:29,600
so the business is quite like anxious to

181
00:06:29,600 --> 00:06:31,440
get that sorted

182
00:06:31,440 --> 00:06:33,280
but that's okay you know what you need

183
00:06:33,280 --> 00:06:35,280
to do you need to do treadmilling

184
00:06:35,280 --> 00:06:38,319
and the death star but before you start

185
00:06:38,319 --> 00:06:39,199
the treadmill

186
00:06:39,199 --> 00:06:41,039
you need to come up with like evil

187
00:06:41,039 --> 00:06:43,360
personas it's not possible to

188
00:06:43,360 --> 00:06:45,440
like to try to defend against everything

189
00:06:45,440 --> 00:06:46,560
and everyone

190
00:06:46,560 --> 00:06:49,199
so you did a summer research to try to

191
00:06:49,199 --> 00:06:49,840
identify

192
00:06:49,840 --> 00:06:51,680
what kind of attackers would actually

193
00:06:51,680 --> 00:06:54,479
attack the death star

194
00:06:54,479 --> 00:06:57,759
and the first one is a script kd jar jar

195
00:06:57,759 --> 00:06:58,479
binks

196
00:06:58,479 --> 00:07:01,039
right like personified by jar jar binks

197
00:07:01,039 --> 00:07:03,360
they don't have much expertise

198
00:07:03,360 --> 00:07:05,199
they don't have much resources they

199
00:07:05,199 --> 00:07:06,960
might have a weapon here and there

200
00:07:06,960 --> 00:07:09,919
they might have a specific tool to hack

201
00:07:09,919 --> 00:07:10,720
and

202
00:07:10,720 --> 00:07:12,240
organization they don't organize

203
00:07:12,240 --> 00:07:14,560
themselves very well they work like a

204
00:07:14,560 --> 00:07:16,400
loan trying to get some money here and

205
00:07:16,400 --> 00:07:17,280
there

206
00:07:17,280 --> 00:07:18,560
i'm not even going to spend too much

207
00:07:18,560 --> 00:07:21,120
time on this persona because

208
00:07:21,120 --> 00:07:23,199
uh it's not very important for this

209
00:07:23,199 --> 00:07:25,360
trend modeling

210
00:07:25,360 --> 00:07:28,560
this other persona though is a lot more

211
00:07:28,560 --> 00:07:29,120
important

212
00:07:29,120 --> 00:07:31,120
because that's uh personified by a han

213
00:07:31,120 --> 00:07:32,639
solo multi-hunters

214
00:07:32,639 --> 00:07:34,160
they know what they're doing they have a

215
00:07:34,160 --> 00:07:36,240
high level of expertise

216
00:07:36,240 --> 00:07:38,400
they have a high level resources as well

217
00:07:38,400 --> 00:07:39,520
they might have a ship

218
00:07:39,520 --> 00:07:41,520
they might have like weapons so they can

219
00:07:41,520 --> 00:07:44,639
be quite annoying for the empire

220
00:07:44,639 --> 00:07:47,360
but the organization of them is also

221
00:07:47,360 --> 00:07:47,919
very

222
00:07:47,919 --> 00:07:50,960
very low they usually work alone or

223
00:07:50,960 --> 00:07:52,319
working pairs

224
00:07:52,319 --> 00:07:53,840
they're more like free souls they're

225
00:07:53,840 --> 00:07:55,599
there just to get some money but they

226
00:07:55,599 --> 00:07:57,759
don't have any big goals they just want

227
00:07:57,759 --> 00:07:58,080
to

228
00:07:58,080 --> 00:08:02,000
have a good life let's say that

229
00:08:02,160 --> 00:08:05,280
but then you have a jedis right and your

230
00:08:05,280 --> 00:08:07,919
diets

231
00:08:07,919 --> 00:08:10,080
they are really a problem are they like

232
00:08:10,080 --> 00:08:12,160
the expertise is very high

233
00:08:12,160 --> 00:08:14,720
after all they use magic how can you

234
00:08:14,720 --> 00:08:15,919
defend against magic

235
00:08:15,919 --> 00:08:19,199
it's possible lucky you it sees your

236
00:08:19,199 --> 00:08:19,919
boss

237
00:08:19,919 --> 00:08:22,639
kind of kill all them a few years ago

238
00:08:22,639 --> 00:08:24,240
before this whole thing

239
00:08:24,240 --> 00:08:26,639
uh there are probably a few here and

240
00:08:26,639 --> 00:08:27,520
there

241
00:08:27,520 --> 00:08:30,319
uh but if they are still alive they are

242
00:08:30,319 --> 00:08:30,639
like

243
00:08:30,639 --> 00:08:32,080
hiding themselves in the bush or

244
00:08:32,080 --> 00:08:34,640
whatever so they have a high level of

245
00:08:34,640 --> 00:08:35,440
expertise

246
00:08:35,440 --> 00:08:38,719
that's really hard to beat but if they

247
00:08:38,719 --> 00:08:40,159
are still over there

248
00:08:40,159 --> 00:08:42,320
they probably have not many resources

249
00:08:42,320 --> 00:08:43,519
they are hiding

250
00:08:43,519 --> 00:08:45,200
they don't want to call any attention so

251
00:08:45,200 --> 00:08:46,560
they are quiet

252
00:08:46,560 --> 00:08:48,640
and organizations as well they like

253
00:08:48,640 --> 00:08:50,080
probably don't talk to each other

254
00:08:50,080 --> 00:08:52,240
they used to have the jedi order and

255
00:08:52,240 --> 00:08:54,160
have a high level of organization

256
00:08:54,160 --> 00:08:56,480
but after this whole like clone wars

257
00:08:56,480 --> 00:08:57,519
kind of thing

258
00:08:57,519 --> 00:09:00,560
uh this uh doesn't exist anymore

259
00:09:00,560 --> 00:09:02,880
so you just hope that this kind of

260
00:09:02,880 --> 00:09:04,160
people don't show up

261
00:09:04,160 --> 00:09:07,200
in your path um

262
00:09:07,200 --> 00:09:10,480
and finally you have um uh no finally

263
00:09:10,480 --> 00:09:11,760
there's one more

264
00:09:11,760 --> 00:09:15,040
you have like insider threat right and

265
00:09:15,040 --> 00:09:16,640
honestly you signed the trade should

266
00:09:16,640 --> 00:09:18,959
cover a lot of personas

267
00:09:18,959 --> 00:09:21,279
but interesting of time i just covered

268
00:09:21,279 --> 00:09:22,959
in you only one

269
00:09:22,959 --> 00:09:25,200
so you can have like a low rank storm

270
00:09:25,200 --> 00:09:26,000
troopa

271
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:28,880
has a very different like um threat

272
00:09:28,880 --> 00:09:30,160
level of a high

273
00:09:30,160 --> 00:09:33,600
like executive like yourself right but

274
00:09:33,600 --> 00:09:36,000
i just do like an average even if you're

275
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:37,680
a low ranked storm trooper

276
00:09:37,680 --> 00:09:39,680
they have a high level of expertise

277
00:09:39,680 --> 00:09:41,839
after all they have been trained by the

278
00:09:41,839 --> 00:09:44,720
empire the resource as well just a bit

279
00:09:44,720 --> 00:09:45,040
of

280
00:09:45,040 --> 00:09:47,440
the average like these are low rank

281
00:09:47,440 --> 00:09:49,680
storm troopers probably like not much if

282
00:09:49,680 --> 00:09:51,279
he's a person like himself

283
00:09:51,279 --> 00:09:53,200
a cso then they have a lot more

284
00:09:53,200 --> 00:09:55,120
resources but they can organize

285
00:09:55,120 --> 00:09:56,320
themselves pretty well

286
00:09:56,320 --> 00:09:57,920
they have been training the military

287
00:09:57,920 --> 00:09:59,839
tactics and stuff

288
00:09:59,839 --> 00:10:02,000
so if they like uh want to attack

289
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:03,279
against the empire they're probably

290
00:10:03,279 --> 00:10:04,000
going to do

291
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:07,120
in our organized way

292
00:10:07,120 --> 00:10:10,560
and now finally the last persona

293
00:10:10,560 --> 00:10:13,839
princess leah and she represents the

294
00:10:13,839 --> 00:10:14,720
rebellion

295
00:10:14,720 --> 00:10:18,079
this terrorist organization she has like

296
00:10:18,079 --> 00:10:18,320
a

297
00:10:18,320 --> 00:10:20,880
real level of expertise because the

298
00:10:20,880 --> 00:10:21,600
rebellion

299
00:10:21,600 --> 00:10:24,800
has its whole sort of um people they

300
00:10:24,800 --> 00:10:26,000
have pilots

301
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:29,120
they have uh spies they have uh

302
00:10:29,120 --> 00:10:30,880
diplomats they have all sorts of people

303
00:10:30,880 --> 00:10:33,360
so they have a high level of expertise

304
00:10:33,360 --> 00:10:35,040
for a terrorist organization the

305
00:10:35,040 --> 00:10:36,720
rebellion is doing pretty well

306
00:10:36,720 --> 00:10:39,279
they have an army after all so they can

307
00:10:39,279 --> 00:10:40,399
like fight the

308
00:10:40,399 --> 00:10:43,600
empire toe to toe sometimes and then

309
00:10:43,600 --> 00:10:44,240
again

310
00:10:44,240 --> 00:10:45,920
they they can't organize themselves

311
00:10:45,920 --> 00:10:47,920
pretty well seems like they

312
00:10:47,920 --> 00:10:50,880
they have been fighting the empire um

313
00:10:50,880 --> 00:10:52,640
for some videos already

314
00:10:52,640 --> 00:10:55,279
so princess leia is probably your best

315
00:10:55,279 --> 00:10:58,720
yeah it's your worst headache

316
00:10:58,720 --> 00:11:01,440
these are the five personas you have

317
00:11:01,440 --> 00:11:01,920
right

318
00:11:01,920 --> 00:11:05,040
from scriptkd to princess leah but

319
00:11:05,040 --> 00:11:06,720
probably princess leah is the person you

320
00:11:06,720 --> 00:11:08,399
need to be really careful about

321
00:11:08,399 --> 00:11:10,640
she is probably gonna be the one moving

322
00:11:10,640 --> 00:11:13,519
against the death star

323
00:11:13,519 --> 00:11:15,680
then you need to get uh going back to

324
00:11:15,680 --> 00:11:16,560
the real world

325
00:11:16,560 --> 00:11:19,519
a little bit you need to get data if you

326
00:11:19,519 --> 00:11:21,279
want to do that in your own organization

327
00:11:21,279 --> 00:11:23,600
for to create your own legal personas

328
00:11:23,600 --> 00:11:25,519
you need to get some data if you are

329
00:11:25,519 --> 00:11:27,120
working a large organization you

330
00:11:27,120 --> 00:11:28,320
probably have already

331
00:11:28,320 --> 00:11:30,959
probably are already target of attacks

332
00:11:30,959 --> 00:11:32,800
so you can have get some data and try to

333
00:11:32,800 --> 00:11:34,320
understand what kind of attacks

334
00:11:34,320 --> 00:11:37,120
are going after you but if you're a

335
00:11:37,120 --> 00:11:38,480
smaller organization

336
00:11:38,480 --> 00:11:40,640
you can drive something very like a

337
00:11:40,640 --> 00:11:43,279
small something like very generic

338
00:11:43,279 --> 00:11:45,760
as as you go along then you can improve

339
00:11:45,760 --> 00:11:47,040
your own personas

340
00:11:47,040 --> 00:11:48,640
but it's really important to have them

341
00:11:48,640 --> 00:11:51,680
to do your thread moment

342
00:11:51,760 --> 00:11:54,320
then you start to do the attack tree

343
00:11:54,320 --> 00:11:54,959
right

344
00:11:54,959 --> 00:11:57,839
you come up with the personas already so

345
00:11:57,839 --> 00:11:59,519
you know how you are up against

346
00:11:59,519 --> 00:12:02,160
but now you need to do the attack three

347
00:12:02,160 --> 00:12:03,600
and the first thing to do the attack

348
00:12:03,600 --> 00:12:04,399
tree is to

349
00:12:04,399 --> 00:12:06,480
need to get the right people in the room

350
00:12:06,480 --> 00:12:08,480
or in this case in the kovid world

351
00:12:08,480 --> 00:12:10,800
you need to get a boarding science zoo

352
00:12:10,800 --> 00:12:12,880
meeting and then

353
00:12:12,880 --> 00:12:14,639
but if you think like it's hard to

354
00:12:14,639 --> 00:12:17,120
manage time zones when you're booking

355
00:12:17,120 --> 00:12:18,880
like meetings imagine when people are

356
00:12:18,880 --> 00:12:21,279
different planets so however the galaxy

357
00:12:21,279 --> 00:12:23,680
but somehow you manage to get everyone

358
00:12:23,680 --> 00:12:24,880
in the room you get

359
00:12:24,880 --> 00:12:26,959
like death star builders are pets

360
00:12:26,959 --> 00:12:28,160
developers

361
00:12:28,160 --> 00:12:30,320
and you got your young team the security

362
00:12:30,320 --> 00:12:31,440
team

363
00:12:31,440 --> 00:12:33,680
and even got like darth vader to do like

364
00:12:33,680 --> 00:12:35,600
a five minutes introduction

365
00:12:35,600 --> 00:12:37,360
to warm up the room you know give them

366
00:12:37,360 --> 00:12:39,839
some motivation

367
00:12:40,800 --> 00:12:43,519
then you start to build the top three

368
00:12:43,519 --> 00:12:45,040
right and the attack three

369
00:12:45,040 --> 00:12:47,519
is basically we start with a root note

370
00:12:47,519 --> 00:12:48,720
where the attacker go

371
00:12:48,720 --> 00:12:50,880
we're gonna go try it in a moment and

372
00:12:50,880 --> 00:12:52,320
then you have the different leaves

373
00:12:52,320 --> 00:12:53,040
that's how

374
00:12:53,040 --> 00:12:56,160
you achieve the goal okay we're gonna go

375
00:12:56,160 --> 00:12:58,160
together this process to make sure

376
00:12:58,160 --> 00:13:01,279
and the bar understand what it is so you

377
00:13:01,279 --> 00:13:03,200
have your personas right

378
00:13:03,200 --> 00:13:06,480
jajar han solo the jedi obi-wan

379
00:13:06,480 --> 00:13:07,920
they started thread stormtrooper and

380
00:13:07,920 --> 00:13:10,000
princess leia you go

381
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:12,800
you try to think like them which kind of

382
00:13:12,800 --> 00:13:15,200
goal they'll go after the death star

383
00:13:15,200 --> 00:13:17,279
so for example han solo might look at

384
00:13:17,279 --> 00:13:19,279
the death star and think about maybe i

385
00:13:19,279 --> 00:13:20,800
can get some money out of it

386
00:13:20,800 --> 00:13:24,480
kiss to some weapons yeah that's a valid

387
00:13:24,480 --> 00:13:24,959
goal

388
00:13:24,959 --> 00:13:27,519
but is really that bad for the empire if

389
00:13:27,519 --> 00:13:29,040
han solo accomplished that

390
00:13:29,040 --> 00:13:31,440
should you focus your efforts protect

391
00:13:31,440 --> 00:13:33,680
against han solo

392
00:13:33,680 --> 00:13:36,320
so you do a brainstorm and you come up

393
00:13:36,320 --> 00:13:37,920
with two kind of goals

394
00:13:37,920 --> 00:13:40,079
that uh your personas can try to

395
00:13:40,079 --> 00:13:41,519
accomplish in the death star they're

396
00:13:41,519 --> 00:13:43,120
really really bad for the galactic

397
00:13:43,120 --> 00:13:44,399
empire

398
00:13:44,399 --> 00:13:47,040
one is taking control of the death star

399
00:13:47,040 --> 00:13:49,839
imagine you build like this 20 years

400
00:13:49,839 --> 00:13:52,399
old spaceship just the moment you

401
00:13:52,399 --> 00:13:54,000
release that production somebody just

402
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:55,600
take over use against you

403
00:13:55,600 --> 00:13:58,880
right real real bad and then

404
00:13:58,880 --> 00:14:00,560
you have uh take that start out of

405
00:14:00,560 --> 00:14:03,040
action imagine like you just released

406
00:14:03,040 --> 00:14:03,920
that production

407
00:14:03,920 --> 00:14:06,560
and then it blows up or it stops working

408
00:14:06,560 --> 00:14:08,079
for some reason and then you need to

409
00:14:08,079 --> 00:14:09,360
start all over again

410
00:14:09,360 --> 00:14:10,959
so there are the two main goals you need

411
00:14:10,959 --> 00:14:14,079
to be worried about

412
00:14:14,079 --> 00:14:16,880
but to be honest you're probably gonna

413
00:14:16,880 --> 00:14:17,600
look at the

414
00:14:17,600 --> 00:14:19,440
take that star out of action take

415
00:14:19,440 --> 00:14:20,639
control of death star

416
00:14:20,639 --> 00:14:23,839
it's not only really hard to do that but

417
00:14:23,839 --> 00:14:24,959
also it's very like

418
00:14:24,959 --> 00:14:26,880
lots of proprietary technologies they're

419
00:14:26,880 --> 00:14:28,880
very specific to the empire

420
00:14:28,880 --> 00:14:31,199
so it's pro there's no persona here that

421
00:14:31,199 --> 00:14:32,160
can actually

422
00:14:32,160 --> 00:14:34,480
do that like devstar is a huge spaceship

423
00:14:34,480 --> 00:14:37,279
you need a huge crew a lot of expertise

424
00:14:37,279 --> 00:14:39,360
so it's probably not something it's

425
00:14:39,360 --> 00:14:42,079
feasible for any of your personas to do

426
00:14:42,079 --> 00:14:44,320
to take their death style of the action

427
00:14:44,320 --> 00:14:45,760
though is different

428
00:14:45,760 --> 00:14:47,600
and princess leah is probably the one

429
00:14:47,600 --> 00:14:49,600
who can pull that out

430
00:14:49,600 --> 00:14:52,720
so you choose your goal take that style

431
00:14:52,720 --> 00:14:53,440
of action

432
00:14:53,440 --> 00:14:56,160
that's your root note so how can you

433
00:14:56,160 --> 00:14:57,519
accomplish this

434
00:14:57,519 --> 00:15:00,399
right you can either disable the dev

435
00:15:00,399 --> 00:15:01,040
star

436
00:15:01,040 --> 00:15:02,880
or you can destroy the death star and

437
00:15:02,880 --> 00:15:04,160
when i say disable

438
00:15:04,160 --> 00:15:06,560
it's not a disable like a small disabled

439
00:15:06,560 --> 00:15:08,480
for 50 minutes or whatever it's like

440
00:15:08,480 --> 00:15:11,760
when you break your iphone screen

441
00:15:11,760 --> 00:15:14,000
the device might be working behind the

442
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:15,600
scenes but you're not you're not able to

443
00:15:15,600 --> 00:15:16,720
use anymore

444
00:15:16,720 --> 00:15:18,240
and the screen is so expensive that you

445
00:15:18,240 --> 00:15:20,480
might as well just buy a new one

446
00:15:20,480 --> 00:15:22,240
so we're talking about this kind of like

447
00:15:22,240 --> 00:15:24,399
disablement or just try the death star

448
00:15:24,399 --> 00:15:27,680
for some somehow you can also like um

449
00:15:27,680 --> 00:15:30,160
have uh that as a goal and then i have

450
00:15:30,160 --> 00:15:31,600
as a way to accomplish your

451
00:15:31,600 --> 00:15:34,880
goal that's take that style of action

452
00:15:34,880 --> 00:15:36,720
so let's focus a little bit on disable

453
00:15:36,720 --> 00:15:38,880
the death star

454
00:15:38,880 --> 00:15:41,199
to disable the deaf star you can't do it

455
00:15:41,199 --> 00:15:41,920
in two ways

456
00:15:41,920 --> 00:15:44,079
and then again there was like a real

457
00:15:44,079 --> 00:15:46,160
brainstorm people talking

458
00:15:46,160 --> 00:15:48,399
but and then you just figure out that's

459
00:15:48,399 --> 00:15:49,279
the most

460
00:15:49,279 --> 00:15:51,759
uh the likelihood for this to happen

461
00:15:51,759 --> 00:15:53,040
it's all higher than any other

462
00:15:53,040 --> 00:15:54,480
possibility so i'm going to focus on

463
00:15:54,480 --> 00:15:55,279
that

464
00:15:55,279 --> 00:15:57,199
so have a system failure and a

465
00:15:57,199 --> 00:15:58,800
mechanical failure right

466
00:15:58,800 --> 00:16:00,880
system failure some sort of iq system

467
00:16:00,880 --> 00:16:02,240
running the death star some sort of

468
00:16:02,240 --> 00:16:03,759
electronical system that

469
00:16:03,759 --> 00:16:05,600
if you cause a huge failure you might

470
00:16:05,600 --> 00:16:07,040
save the death star

471
00:16:07,040 --> 00:16:08,720
maybe you mess up with the healing

472
00:16:08,720 --> 00:16:11,040
system and his disease is not working

473
00:16:11,040 --> 00:16:13,199
or you can like mess up the navigation

474
00:16:13,199 --> 00:16:15,120
system and now the death star is lost

475
00:16:15,120 --> 00:16:16,880
somewhere

476
00:16:16,880 --> 00:16:18,959
but you can also cause some kind of

477
00:16:18,959 --> 00:16:21,040
mechanic failure maybe you mess up with

478
00:16:21,040 --> 00:16:23,279
the reactor director stop working

479
00:16:23,279 --> 00:16:25,279
and that's also another way to disable

480
00:16:25,279 --> 00:16:26,880
the dev stuff

481
00:16:26,880 --> 00:16:29,680
but how would you accomplish this for

482
00:16:29,680 --> 00:16:31,199
system failure

483
00:16:31,199 --> 00:16:32,720
you need to compromise some sort of

484
00:16:32,720 --> 00:16:34,480
critical id system like

485
00:16:34,480 --> 00:16:36,880
not everyone's gonna have a level of

486
00:16:36,880 --> 00:16:38,000
access they can do

487
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:39,759
something like this so you need to

488
00:16:39,759 --> 00:16:41,360
compromise the system

489
00:16:41,360 --> 00:16:43,920
to get to that in a mechanical failure

490
00:16:43,920 --> 00:16:45,360
you need to overload

491
00:16:45,360 --> 00:16:47,360
some sort of critical infrastructure all

492
00:16:47,360 --> 00:16:49,120
right you might overload the reactor in

493
00:16:49,120 --> 00:16:51,199
my overload heating system

494
00:16:51,199 --> 00:16:53,360
but somehow you need to like to overload

495
00:16:53,360 --> 00:16:54,560
the system

496
00:16:54,560 --> 00:16:57,600
in order to actually do this uh this

497
00:16:57,600 --> 00:16:59,040
attack

498
00:16:59,040 --> 00:17:02,719
but how can you accomplish this

499
00:17:03,040 --> 00:17:05,119
that like and that's a really good thing

500
00:17:05,119 --> 00:17:06,959
when you see that on uh

501
00:17:06,959 --> 00:17:08,880
an attack tree that goes to the same

502
00:17:08,880 --> 00:17:11,119
kind of node it shows this node

503
00:17:11,119 --> 00:17:13,280
it's very very important that saying

504
00:17:13,280 --> 00:17:14,240
like you need to have

505
00:17:14,240 --> 00:17:17,439
privileged access to the network unless

506
00:17:17,439 --> 00:17:19,280
if you i try to compromise

507
00:17:19,280 --> 00:17:22,720
compromise i.t system or maybe overload

508
00:17:22,720 --> 00:17:24,160
the critical infrastructure

509
00:17:24,160 --> 00:17:25,599
you might need to have some sort of

510
00:17:25,599 --> 00:17:27,520
access to the network that's privileged

511
00:17:27,520 --> 00:17:29,200
and most people don't have it

512
00:17:29,200 --> 00:17:32,960
right how would you do that

513
00:17:32,960 --> 00:17:35,600
you would get like by going inside the

514
00:17:35,600 --> 00:17:36,960
death star

515
00:17:36,960 --> 00:17:39,120
don't forget the death star is a weapon

516
00:17:39,120 --> 00:17:40,799
right so it tries like

517
00:17:40,799 --> 00:17:42,559
it doesn't expose much to the outside

518
00:17:42,559 --> 00:17:44,080
world it's very

519
00:17:44,080 --> 00:17:47,039
looking internally so you need to have

520
00:17:47,039 --> 00:17:48,080
physical access

521
00:17:48,080 --> 00:17:49,760
in order to get a privileged access to

522
00:17:49,760 --> 00:17:51,280
the network

523
00:17:51,280 --> 00:17:53,200
we could go even deeper and try to

524
00:17:53,200 --> 00:17:55,120
figure out how to get physical access to

525
00:17:55,120 --> 00:17:56,160
the death star

526
00:17:56,160 --> 00:17:58,559
but remember one of our personas is

527
00:17:58,559 --> 00:18:00,000
actually inside the threat

528
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:02,640
right so your attacker might be there

529
00:18:02,640 --> 00:18:04,480
already

530
00:18:04,480 --> 00:18:07,200
and like the death star is he needs such

531
00:18:07,200 --> 00:18:07,760
a

532
00:18:07,760 --> 00:18:10,880
huge crew like so many people that's not

533
00:18:10,880 --> 00:18:12,400
very hard to get people

534
00:18:12,400 --> 00:18:14,320
to go inside the death star so we're

535
00:18:14,320 --> 00:18:15,919
going to stop here this part of the

536
00:18:15,919 --> 00:18:17,520
factory

537
00:18:17,520 --> 00:18:19,600
that's all we have so far you have the

538
00:18:19,600 --> 00:18:20,640
goal

539
00:18:20,640 --> 00:18:23,200
take that that start out of action you

540
00:18:23,200 --> 00:18:24,960
have disabled the death star

541
00:18:24,960 --> 00:18:27,200
system failure mechanical failure

542
00:18:27,200 --> 00:18:28,799
compromise achieve system

543
00:18:28,799 --> 00:18:30,240
overload critical critical

544
00:18:30,240 --> 00:18:32,559
infrastructure and stopping at privilege

545
00:18:32,559 --> 00:18:34,799
access to the network

546
00:18:34,799 --> 00:18:38,320
all right so we go to the next node on

547
00:18:38,320 --> 00:18:38,720
the

548
00:18:38,720 --> 00:18:40,880
on the root node that's destroy the

549
00:18:40,880 --> 00:18:43,280
death star and destroy the death star

550
00:18:43,280 --> 00:18:46,559
is not as complicated you have

551
00:18:46,559 --> 00:18:48,960
probably like two only ways it's a

552
00:18:48,960 --> 00:18:50,640
strong military attack

553
00:18:50,640 --> 00:18:52,960
which the rebellion can't do they again

554
00:18:52,960 --> 00:18:54,799
they have for your personas

555
00:18:54,799 --> 00:18:56,320
they are the only ones who actually have

556
00:18:56,320 --> 00:18:59,120
a army they can have some ships and

557
00:18:59,120 --> 00:19:02,559
attack the empire or

558
00:19:02,559 --> 00:19:04,400
and that's very interesting one you

559
00:19:04,400 --> 00:19:07,200
found a vulnerability on the death star

560
00:19:07,200 --> 00:19:09,520
that's you can't destroy the reactor and

561
00:19:09,520 --> 00:19:12,400
how can you do that

562
00:19:12,400 --> 00:19:15,600
so the dab star is a huge spaceship and

563
00:19:15,600 --> 00:19:17,120
the very core of the

564
00:19:17,120 --> 00:19:21,200
ship they have a fusion reactor

565
00:19:21,200 --> 00:19:24,240
right and that's very very hot and

566
00:19:24,240 --> 00:19:26,160
in order like to make the reactor

567
00:19:26,160 --> 00:19:27,280
working the

568
00:19:27,280 --> 00:19:29,919
the heat needs to dissipate and needs to

569
00:19:29,919 --> 00:19:31,039
go through a port

570
00:19:31,039 --> 00:19:34,080
that's called a thermal exhaust port

571
00:19:34,080 --> 00:19:38,559
which makes sense but is also one way to

572
00:19:38,559 --> 00:19:39,360
go

573
00:19:39,360 --> 00:19:43,200
to attack the reactor right

574
00:19:43,200 --> 00:19:46,080
look the port itself is not very big

575
00:19:46,080 --> 00:19:46,640
it's just

576
00:19:46,640 --> 00:19:49,919
two meters wide so for a ship to go

577
00:19:49,919 --> 00:19:50,320
there

578
00:19:50,320 --> 00:19:54,000
and like try to hit this uh these sports

579
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:56,559
is really really really hard shot and

580
00:19:56,559 --> 00:19:58,000
they need to know

581
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:01,200
where the hoe is on where the port is

582
00:20:01,200 --> 00:20:03,440
right uh it's not very obvious for

583
00:20:03,440 --> 00:20:05,520
outside where this part is

584
00:20:05,520 --> 00:20:07,919
so they need to have some information in

585
00:20:07,919 --> 00:20:10,880
order to get to that

586
00:20:10,880 --> 00:20:12,880
so to destroy the reactor you need to

587
00:20:12,880 --> 00:20:15,360
shoot at the thermal port

588
00:20:15,360 --> 00:20:17,360
to shoot at the thermal port you need to

589
00:20:17,360 --> 00:20:18,960
get the death star plans

590
00:20:18,960 --> 00:20:20,880
you need to know where it is so you can

591
00:20:20,880 --> 00:20:23,600
try to make the shot

592
00:20:23,600 --> 00:20:26,480
that's the second bit of our attack tree

593
00:20:26,480 --> 00:20:28,400
so we have destroy devstar minitar

594
00:20:28,400 --> 00:20:28,880
attack

595
00:20:28,880 --> 00:20:31,039
destroy reactors through the term port

596
00:20:31,039 --> 00:20:33,679
and obtain that star glimpse

597
00:20:33,679 --> 00:20:36,720
oh sorry there you go and then

598
00:20:36,720 --> 00:20:39,280
this is everything the whole tree all

599
00:20:39,280 --> 00:20:41,200
together

600
00:20:41,200 --> 00:20:43,760
so what are the things you need to be

601
00:20:43,760 --> 00:20:45,440
concerned about

602
00:20:45,440 --> 00:20:48,320
princess leah either trying a military

603
00:20:48,320 --> 00:20:49,039
attack

604
00:20:49,039 --> 00:20:50,880
that's only trying to destroy the death

605
00:20:50,880 --> 00:20:52,320
star

606
00:20:52,320 --> 00:20:54,320
the thermal port and the privilege

607
00:20:54,320 --> 00:20:55,679
access to the network

608
00:20:55,679 --> 00:20:57,039
these are the things you need to be very

609
00:20:57,039 --> 00:20:59,760
concerned about

610
00:21:00,080 --> 00:21:01,520
now going back to the real world a

611
00:21:01,520 --> 00:21:03,280
little bit

612
00:21:03,280 --> 00:21:06,320
why i like attack trees is because you

613
00:21:06,320 --> 00:21:06,799
put

614
00:21:06,799 --> 00:21:08,799
the problem as a problem solving

615
00:21:08,799 --> 00:21:10,320
exercise

616
00:21:10,320 --> 00:21:12,159
when you interact with people like

617
00:21:12,159 --> 00:21:14,000
developers product manners

618
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:16,159
how these people they have already a

619
00:21:16,159 --> 00:21:19,120
very strong mindset of problem solving

620
00:21:19,120 --> 00:21:21,360
but they are very use it to get this

621
00:21:21,360 --> 00:21:23,039
kind of mindset and apply

622
00:21:23,039 --> 00:21:26,159
to building things what i am asking for

623
00:21:26,159 --> 00:21:27,039
them to do

624
00:21:27,039 --> 00:21:30,720
is to stop building start breaking

625
00:21:30,720 --> 00:21:32,880
and that's i think where the magic is

626
00:21:32,880 --> 00:21:34,159
really important that's where the match

627
00:21:34,159 --> 00:21:35,600
happens for child modeling

628
00:21:35,600 --> 00:21:36,960
and that's why the secure posture

629
00:21:36,960 --> 00:21:38,640
improves because now we got these people

630
00:21:38,640 --> 00:21:40,159
that never thought about like how to

631
00:21:40,159 --> 00:21:41,679
attack resistance

632
00:21:41,679 --> 00:21:43,280
and then they have like one hour and a

633
00:21:43,280 --> 00:21:45,520
half two hours to actually go to the

634
00:21:45,520 --> 00:21:47,440
system and see how they can attack this

635
00:21:47,440 --> 00:21:48,400
is that they

636
00:21:48,400 --> 00:21:50,960
build themselves so they might find it's

637
00:21:50,960 --> 00:21:52,000
very interesting they find

638
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:53,360
vulnerabilities on the system they

639
00:21:53,360 --> 00:21:54,480
already built

640
00:21:54,480 --> 00:21:57,520
or they are about to build that's really

641
00:21:57,520 --> 00:21:58,000
powerful

642
00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:00,320
because now they know they can't do that

643
00:22:00,320 --> 00:22:02,720
anymore they cannot even argue if that's

644
00:22:02,720 --> 00:22:04,000
actually vulnerability or not because

645
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:05,679
they found themselves

646
00:22:05,679 --> 00:22:07,760
so you get a lot of my uh a lot of

647
00:22:07,760 --> 00:22:10,080
buying to be in the room with the people

648
00:22:10,080 --> 00:22:11,600
who are building the software because

649
00:22:11,600 --> 00:22:13,120
you don't have this kind of like

650
00:22:13,120 --> 00:22:15,039
pushback oh this is a vulnerability and

651
00:22:15,039 --> 00:22:16,799
they go back oh it's not

652
00:22:16,799 --> 00:22:18,960
so you get like their knowledge about

653
00:22:18,960 --> 00:22:20,480
how to build the system they know better

654
00:22:20,480 --> 00:22:21,840
than everyone else

655
00:22:21,840 --> 00:22:24,720
with the security team that's i've uh

656
00:22:24,720 --> 00:22:25,520
used to think like

657
00:22:25,520 --> 00:22:27,760
attackers get them together and bring

658
00:22:27,760 --> 00:22:29,840
some really good results

659
00:22:29,840 --> 00:22:33,439
that's why i like attackers

660
00:22:33,679 --> 00:22:36,159
going back to star wars then we need to

661
00:22:36,159 --> 00:22:38,240
talk about mitigating risks right we

662
00:22:38,240 --> 00:22:39,360
already identify

663
00:22:39,360 --> 00:22:42,720
a few of them and the first one

664
00:22:42,720 --> 00:22:46,000
is a privilege access to the network

665
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:47,360
so remember like when i talk about the

666
00:22:47,360 --> 00:22:49,360
trees is one of the the ones that like

667
00:22:49,360 --> 00:22:51,360
can actually go into different

668
00:22:51,360 --> 00:22:53,200
directions like to attack

669
00:22:53,200 --> 00:22:55,840
so the effect is really high because if

670
00:22:55,840 --> 00:22:58,159
you get privileged access to the network

671
00:22:58,159 --> 00:23:00,320
you can eventually disable the death

672
00:23:00,320 --> 00:23:01,440
star

673
00:23:01,440 --> 00:23:04,240
the likelihood we just put is a medium

674
00:23:04,240 --> 00:23:06,000
medium because you need to have physical

675
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:07,600
access to the death star

676
00:23:07,600 --> 00:23:09,760
but it's not that hard and the death

677
00:23:09,760 --> 00:23:12,320
star like the empire is not very well

678
00:23:12,320 --> 00:23:14,080
known for the security practice

679
00:23:14,080 --> 00:23:16,960
like the rebellion uses drugs to hack an

680
00:23:16,960 --> 00:23:18,960
empire all the time

681
00:23:18,960 --> 00:23:21,919
but that can be mitigated right so you

682
00:23:21,919 --> 00:23:22,320
can

683
00:23:22,320 --> 00:23:24,720
improve like the network segregation we

684
00:23:24,720 --> 00:23:26,640
can improve network monitoring

685
00:23:26,640 --> 00:23:29,120
you can keep doing penetration testing

686
00:23:29,120 --> 00:23:31,120
and after a few weeks

687
00:23:31,120 --> 00:23:34,640
you can see your progress and then you

688
00:23:34,640 --> 00:23:36,640
change the likelihood to low

689
00:23:36,640 --> 00:23:38,720
now it's a lot harder even for a person

690
00:23:38,720 --> 00:23:39,679
besides

691
00:23:39,679 --> 00:23:44,400
the death star to get a privilege access

692
00:23:45,120 --> 00:23:47,039
then you have a military attack where

693
00:23:47,039 --> 00:23:48,400
the impact is very high

694
00:23:48,400 --> 00:23:50,640
destroy the death star and the

695
00:23:50,640 --> 00:23:51,440
likelihood

696
00:23:51,440 --> 00:23:53,919
is also high as long as as soon as the

697
00:23:53,919 --> 00:23:54,640
rebellion

698
00:23:54,640 --> 00:23:56,159
knows about the death star they are

699
00:23:56,159 --> 00:23:57,840
probably what they're gonna try to do

700
00:23:57,840 --> 00:24:00,320
is try to destroy as soon as possible

701
00:24:00,320 --> 00:24:02,559
right

702
00:24:02,640 --> 00:24:05,840
but that also can be mitigated you can

703
00:24:05,840 --> 00:24:08,159
have ram books to respond to attacks

704
00:24:08,159 --> 00:24:09,039
right so

705
00:24:09,039 --> 00:24:11,840
if people are attacking you uh you can

706
00:24:11,840 --> 00:24:12,720
train the crew

707
00:24:12,720 --> 00:24:15,520
to respond more efficiently more quickly

708
00:24:15,520 --> 00:24:16,320
you can

709
00:24:16,320 --> 00:24:18,799
get star destroyers on call strike star

710
00:24:18,799 --> 00:24:20,480
is a huge ships

711
00:24:20,480 --> 00:24:23,440
and they can like support the death star

712
00:24:23,440 --> 00:24:25,440
and to pull this kind of attack

713
00:24:25,440 --> 00:24:27,760
like a big military attack the rebellion

714
00:24:27,760 --> 00:24:29,840
is gonna need to do a lot of noise

715
00:24:29,840 --> 00:24:32,320
and preparation so if you do some

716
00:24:32,320 --> 00:24:33,840
monitoring your activities like some

717
00:24:33,840 --> 00:24:35,279
sort of threat intel

718
00:24:35,279 --> 00:24:37,760
and you get to know the attack before it

719
00:24:37,760 --> 00:24:39,679
happens you can prepare yourself

720
00:24:39,679 --> 00:24:43,120
a lot better and then you can mitigate

721
00:24:43,120 --> 00:24:44,799
those risks a little bit more so get

722
00:24:44,799 --> 00:24:46,640
like an impact that's medium

723
00:24:46,640 --> 00:24:48,720
even if the attack comes your crew is

724
00:24:48,720 --> 00:24:50,480
going to be more prepared and then you

725
00:24:50,480 --> 00:24:52,799
have support of other ships

726
00:24:52,799 --> 00:24:54,960
and the likelihood is also medium

727
00:24:54,960 --> 00:24:56,880
because now we are more prepared for the

728
00:24:56,880 --> 00:24:58,799
attack so the rebellion might think up

729
00:24:58,799 --> 00:25:00,240
twice before attack

730
00:25:00,240 --> 00:25:02,400
and even if they do you are prepared

731
00:25:02,400 --> 00:25:04,320
like to uh

732
00:25:04,320 --> 00:25:06,640
you might know beforehand so you can

733
00:25:06,640 --> 00:25:07,520
avoid

734
00:25:07,520 --> 00:25:10,880
all together now

735
00:25:10,880 --> 00:25:14,159
shoot the thermo port and that's

736
00:25:14,159 --> 00:25:16,559
complicated risk to mitigate because

737
00:25:16,559 --> 00:25:17,520
that's a design

738
00:25:17,520 --> 00:25:20,640
level so remember i was telling how the

739
00:25:20,640 --> 00:25:22,480
death star is a huge project

740
00:25:22,480 --> 00:25:24,320
it's a wonderful project where you have

741
00:25:24,320 --> 00:25:25,679
like uh overdue

742
00:25:25,679 --> 00:25:28,799
over budget so

743
00:25:28,799 --> 00:25:30,480
you come up with the for the business

744
00:25:30,480 --> 00:25:32,480
and said hey we have this vulnerability

745
00:25:32,480 --> 00:25:33,520
here there's actually

746
00:25:33,520 --> 00:25:35,279
no protection on the thermal port

747
00:25:35,279 --> 00:25:37,120
whatsoever the only thing that's

748
00:25:37,120 --> 00:25:38,159
protecting us

749
00:25:38,159 --> 00:25:39,520
is the fact that the rebellion doesn't

750
00:25:39,520 --> 00:25:42,799
know about it we need to do something

751
00:25:42,799 --> 00:25:45,200
but the death star is about to be

752
00:25:45,200 --> 00:25:46,080
released

753
00:25:46,080 --> 00:25:48,320
it's about to be done the business very

754
00:25:48,320 --> 00:25:49,520
anxious

755
00:25:49,520 --> 00:25:52,240
so they said the likelihood is low which

756
00:25:52,240 --> 00:25:54,480
is arguable

757
00:25:54,480 --> 00:25:58,080
and they decided to accept the risk

758
00:25:58,080 --> 00:26:01,039
right which is makes a life harder if

759
00:26:01,039 --> 00:26:01,279
you

760
00:26:01,279 --> 00:26:03,039
could have some sort of protection on

761
00:26:03,039 --> 00:26:05,120
the port they'll be a lot better

762
00:26:05,120 --> 00:26:07,440
but the visas decide against and this

763
00:26:07,440 --> 00:26:08,960
kind of risk is kind of

764
00:26:08,960 --> 00:26:11,840
really hard to measure because the

765
00:26:11,840 --> 00:26:12,480
impact

766
00:26:12,480 --> 00:26:14,720
is quite high of course you can destroy

767
00:26:14,720 --> 00:26:15,679
the death star

768
00:26:15,679 --> 00:26:18,320
but the likelihood is low so it's really

769
00:26:18,320 --> 00:26:20,400
hard for humans to measure about this

770
00:26:20,400 --> 00:26:22,320
kind of risk

771
00:26:22,320 --> 00:26:25,520
so the only thing you can do really is

772
00:26:25,520 --> 00:26:27,039
make sure the rebellion

773
00:26:27,039 --> 00:26:29,360
doesn't know about this right that's

774
00:26:29,360 --> 00:26:31,679
your only a protections obscurity which

775
00:26:31,679 --> 00:26:32,320
we all know

776
00:26:32,320 --> 00:26:34,799
it's not really great but you kind of

777
00:26:34,799 --> 00:26:36,000
have your tie hands

778
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:38,080
it's really hard to get start with darth

779
00:26:38,080 --> 00:26:39,760
vader right

780
00:26:39,760 --> 00:26:42,640
um yeah so you try to hide the death

781
00:26:42,640 --> 00:26:43,520
star plans

782
00:26:43,520 --> 00:26:48,000
in a very secure place and that's it

783
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:51,120
that's what all you can do so

784
00:26:51,120 --> 00:26:53,360
you go on for life start to do all the

785
00:26:53,360 --> 00:26:54,400
stuff the def

786
00:26:54,400 --> 00:26:56,000
you did the best you could to the death

787
00:26:56,000 --> 00:26:58,320
star the death star was

788
00:26:58,320 --> 00:26:59,919
actually released production they

789
00:26:59,919 --> 00:27:02,080
managed even to start a planet

790
00:27:02,080 --> 00:27:06,400
but right after it exploded

791
00:27:06,400 --> 00:27:08,720
so even with all your effort doing

792
00:27:08,720 --> 00:27:10,000
treadmilling

793
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:12,320
you still have explosion your death star

794
00:27:12,320 --> 00:27:14,320
uh exploded

795
00:27:14,320 --> 00:27:17,360
not really great but you you're

796
00:27:17,360 --> 00:27:18,720
professional and then you do what you

797
00:27:18,720 --> 00:27:19,360
can do

798
00:27:19,360 --> 00:27:22,159
you do some sort of forensic analysis

799
00:27:22,159 --> 00:27:23,760
and the first thing you notice about the

800
00:27:23,760 --> 00:27:25,279
forensic analysis

801
00:27:25,279 --> 00:27:28,559
is this guy luke skywalker

802
00:27:28,559 --> 00:27:30,080
and there's some interesting facts about

803
00:27:30,080 --> 00:27:31,840
him

804
00:27:31,840 --> 00:27:35,039
first he's a jedi you're not supposed to

805
00:27:35,039 --> 00:27:36,720
be dead or something

806
00:27:36,720 --> 00:27:40,000
just your boss having like got rid of

807
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:42,799
of all of them yeah there you go there

808
00:27:42,799 --> 00:27:45,120
is one

809
00:27:45,120 --> 00:27:46,880
at the heat of the battle when he's

810
00:27:46,880 --> 00:27:48,880
about to be destroyed

811
00:27:48,880 --> 00:27:51,840
a party hunter actually helped him but

812
00:27:51,840 --> 00:27:52,480
these people

813
00:27:52,480 --> 00:27:54,559
are not supposed to not be very well

814
00:27:54,559 --> 00:27:55,919
organized be more

815
00:27:55,919 --> 00:27:58,399
like free souls kind of stuff why about

816
00:27:58,399 --> 00:28:00,399
hunters helping the rebellion

817
00:28:00,399 --> 00:28:04,559
we don't know he's also

818
00:28:04,559 --> 00:28:07,520
brother of princess leia so besides

819
00:28:07,520 --> 00:28:08,480
being a jedi

820
00:28:08,480 --> 00:28:12,080
he's south nation state god of attacker

821
00:28:12,080 --> 00:28:16,240
maybe and finally the worst of all

822
00:28:16,240 --> 00:28:19,520
he's the son of your boss which makes

823
00:28:19,520 --> 00:28:20,000
things

824
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:23,120
even harder right i have got a bad

825
00:28:23,120 --> 00:28:24,559
feeling about this

826
00:28:24,559 --> 00:28:27,679
so you don't go too deep on that that's

827
00:28:27,679 --> 00:28:29,520
like above your pay grades

828
00:28:29,520 --> 00:28:31,440
that's darth vader and the emperor are

829
00:28:31,440 --> 00:28:32,559
going to talk about this

830
00:28:32,559 --> 00:28:35,600
right but it's luke skywalker is a very

831
00:28:35,600 --> 00:28:38,559
special persona

832
00:28:38,960 --> 00:28:41,440
the other thing to notice is you

833
00:28:41,440 --> 00:28:42,480
actually

834
00:28:42,480 --> 00:28:44,799
try your best to hide that star planes

835
00:28:44,799 --> 00:28:46,000
right you did that

836
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:48,640
but how come luke skywalker knew about

837
00:28:48,640 --> 00:28:50,159
the thermoport

838
00:28:50,159 --> 00:28:53,120
well it turns out the rebellion managed

839
00:28:53,120 --> 00:28:55,200
to get the plans

840
00:28:55,200 --> 00:28:57,120
they managed to go to your data center

841
00:28:57,120 --> 00:28:59,039
and that's footage of that

842
00:28:59,039 --> 00:29:02,880
they loaded your hard drive made a copy

843
00:29:02,880 --> 00:29:05,120
and sent to the rebellion

844
00:29:05,120 --> 00:29:08,799
you know what's worse the worst thing is

845
00:29:08,799 --> 00:29:12,640
is not even encrypted arrests

846
00:29:12,640 --> 00:29:15,039
basic protection is not encrypted

847
00:29:15,039 --> 00:29:16,799
arrests so they managed to get a hard

848
00:29:16,799 --> 00:29:17,520
drive

849
00:29:17,520 --> 00:29:20,559
a copy of princess lia got the plans and

850
00:29:20,559 --> 00:29:23,918
they managed to destroy the death star

851
00:29:24,720 --> 00:29:26,880
but now you need to deliver a report to

852
00:29:26,880 --> 00:29:27,919
your boss

853
00:29:27,919 --> 00:29:30,480
good luck

854
00:29:31,360 --> 00:29:33,120
and finally i will talk a little bit

855
00:29:33,120 --> 00:29:36,799
about lessons learned

856
00:29:37,120 --> 00:29:39,840
the first thing i want to talk about is

857
00:29:39,840 --> 00:29:41,520
you need to tread model

858
00:29:41,520 --> 00:29:44,320
early and often so that's like the

859
00:29:44,320 --> 00:29:45,919
example i gave with the death star

860
00:29:45,919 --> 00:29:48,640
about the thermal port and you know like

861
00:29:48,640 --> 00:29:49,120
very

862
00:29:49,120 --> 00:29:52,320
later in the stage it happens right

863
00:29:52,320 --> 00:29:55,440
like a lot of companies if you had doing

864
00:29:55,440 --> 00:29:56,640
the treadmilling

865
00:29:56,640 --> 00:29:59,440
at the early stages of the death star

866
00:29:59,440 --> 00:30:00,480
you could have know

867
00:30:00,480 --> 00:30:02,320
there's a vulnerability at the design

868
00:30:02,320 --> 00:30:04,880
level where it's a lot cheaper to fix

869
00:30:04,880 --> 00:30:07,360
you could have fixed this all the way

870
00:30:07,360 --> 00:30:09,200
back to the beginning

871
00:30:09,200 --> 00:30:11,440
but because nobody did the treadmill in

872
00:30:11,440 --> 00:30:12,559
exercise

873
00:30:12,559 --> 00:30:15,120
when it comes very later on the process

874
00:30:15,120 --> 00:30:16,559
is a lot harder

875
00:30:16,559 --> 00:30:18,799
to fix it the in the death star in this

876
00:30:18,799 --> 00:30:20,000
case is actually like a

877
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:22,640
ship that's beauty and stuff but that

878
00:30:22,640 --> 00:30:24,240
also happens to software

879
00:30:24,240 --> 00:30:26,240
right so if your software is already

880
00:30:26,240 --> 00:30:27,840
released to production and you found a

881
00:30:27,840 --> 00:30:30,000
critical vulnerability

882
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:32,399
that's built in in the software is

883
00:30:32,399 --> 00:30:34,640
usually very hard to fix

884
00:30:34,640 --> 00:30:37,360
so if you do early if you do a design

885
00:30:37,360 --> 00:30:38,640
level

886
00:30:38,640 --> 00:30:40,960
you can mitigate that very easily and

887
00:30:40,960 --> 00:30:44,320
that will help save the desktop

888
00:30:44,320 --> 00:30:47,520
also um when i was doing my my pilot

889
00:30:47,520 --> 00:30:50,000
with some of the developed teams the

890
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:50,559
pilot

891
00:30:50,559 --> 00:30:54,080
some people said um

892
00:30:54,080 --> 00:30:56,799
tread modes are not cover everything and

893
00:30:56,799 --> 00:30:57,760
they shouldn't be

894
00:30:57,760 --> 00:30:59,919
it's impossible to cover everything in

895
00:30:59,919 --> 00:31:00,880
the thread modeling

896
00:31:00,880 --> 00:31:03,440
you try to focus on what's important and

897
00:31:03,440 --> 00:31:04,080
what's more

898
00:31:04,080 --> 00:31:06,080
likely to happen but they're always

899
00:31:06,080 --> 00:31:08,240
unknowns they're always a vulnerability

900
00:31:08,240 --> 00:31:09,600
you didn't know about it

901
00:31:09,600 --> 00:31:12,000
there is always like um a kind of person

902
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:13,679
who didn't know about it

903
00:31:13,679 --> 00:31:16,159
imagine like luke skywalker what kind of

904
00:31:16,159 --> 00:31:18,720
persona he couldn't predict

905
00:31:18,720 --> 00:31:22,240
that um and that happens in the daily

906
00:31:22,240 --> 00:31:23,919
basis as well you can't cover

907
00:31:23,919 --> 00:31:26,640
everything but a good threat modeling

908
00:31:26,640 --> 00:31:27,919
even though it's not perfect

909
00:31:27,919 --> 00:31:30,880
it's all better than none so don't let

910
00:31:30,880 --> 00:31:31,519
the

911
00:31:31,519 --> 00:31:33,600
um the thing about like oh it's not

912
00:31:33,600 --> 00:31:35,600
cover everything stop you to do it

913
00:31:35,600 --> 00:31:38,320
right but always be careful there always

914
00:31:38,320 --> 00:31:38,960
unknowns

915
00:31:38,960 --> 00:31:40,799
that's why some concepts like the fancy

916
00:31:40,799 --> 00:31:42,240
depths are very important so we can

917
00:31:42,240 --> 00:31:43,760
cover

918
00:31:43,760 --> 00:31:46,559
all the bases in different places but

919
00:31:46,559 --> 00:31:50,000
it's there there are always unknowns

920
00:31:50,080 --> 00:31:52,240
finally if there is one thing i want you

921
00:31:52,240 --> 00:31:53,600
to get from that talk

922
00:31:53,600 --> 00:31:56,640
is this tread and molly must be

923
00:31:56,640 --> 00:31:59,200
engaging you only get gonna get good

924
00:31:59,200 --> 00:32:00,320
results

925
00:32:00,320 --> 00:32:02,559
if you get a process that's

926
00:32:02,559 --> 00:32:04,000
collaborative

927
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:06,080
and is engaging where people go to the

928
00:32:06,080 --> 00:32:07,840
room and they try to participate

929
00:32:07,840 --> 00:32:11,200
the best they can if it's a process

930
00:32:11,200 --> 00:32:14,320
that's very like cumbersome people don't

931
00:32:14,320 --> 00:32:15,120
feel like

932
00:32:15,120 --> 00:32:17,279
it's bringing value the collaboration

933
00:32:17,279 --> 00:32:18,799
doesn't happen and then you lose the

934
00:32:18,799 --> 00:32:20,000
benefit

935
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:21,840
make sure to try them all is engaging

936
00:32:21,840 --> 00:32:24,240
and it's hard as i said at the beginning

937
00:32:24,240 --> 00:32:27,760
try them only by design is quite hard

938
00:32:27,760 --> 00:32:30,399
it's quite like dry it's kind of like no

939
00:32:30,399 --> 00:32:31,760
not very interesting

940
00:32:31,760 --> 00:32:34,559
so maybe mix star wars with it actually

941
00:32:34,559 --> 00:32:35,360
that

942
00:32:35,360 --> 00:32:37,919
i think was successful um you make like

943
00:32:37,919 --> 00:32:39,519
a little bit more interesting but you

944
00:32:39,519 --> 00:32:40,880
need to make

945
00:32:40,880 --> 00:32:43,519
the treadmill engaging and then if you

946
00:32:43,519 --> 00:32:45,760
do that you're going to get good results

947
00:32:45,760 --> 00:32:47,440
regardless of the process it needs to be

948
00:32:47,440 --> 00:32:49,919
engaging

949
00:32:49,919 --> 00:32:51,840
that's it that's what i had to talk

950
00:32:51,840 --> 00:32:53,679
today thank you very much

951
00:32:53,679 --> 00:32:57,120
made the first beer view and also with

952
00:32:57,120 --> 00:32:58,159
you mary that was

953
00:32:58,159 --> 00:33:01,039
awesome i think you made a lot of geeks

954
00:33:01,039 --> 00:33:03,200
very very happy in the chat

955
00:33:03,200 --> 00:33:06,880
um fun conversation happening there

956
00:33:06,880 --> 00:33:10,480
and yeah it i don't get it

957
00:33:10,480 --> 00:33:12,520
i'm like i'm trying to engage

958
00:33:12,520 --> 00:33:14,960
[Laughter]

959
00:33:14,960 --> 00:33:16,960
so mario i absolutely love that last

960
00:33:16,960 --> 00:33:18,799
suggestion of yours in terms of

961
00:33:18,799 --> 00:33:20,640
trying to make it engaging and i love

962
00:33:20,640 --> 00:33:21,840
the idea of like

963
00:33:21,840 --> 00:33:24,799
challenging a
