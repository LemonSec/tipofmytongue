1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:03,300
go I'm going anyway uh it's 11:30 my

2
00:00:03,300 --> 00:00:04,380
time so it's time to go

3
00:00:04,380 --> 00:00:06,720
so hey welcome to the five love

4
00:00:06,720 --> 00:00:08,490
languages of DevOps my name is Matt

5
00:00:08,490 --> 00:00:10,380
Stratton I'm a transformation specialist

6
00:00:10,380 --> 00:00:12,120
at Red Hat but you're not that terribly

7
00:00:12,120 --> 00:00:14,340
interested in me so we're gonna get past

8
00:00:14,340 --> 00:00:15,750
the thing that has my name and we're

9
00:00:15,750 --> 00:00:17,310
gonna actually start talking about some

10
00:00:17,310 --> 00:00:21,420
content so I always DevOps means a lot

11
00:00:21,420 --> 00:00:22,500
of different things to a lot of

12
00:00:22,500 --> 00:00:24,510
different people so I went to Twitter

13
00:00:24,510 --> 00:00:27,000
and I said what is DevOps not and got a

14
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:28,890
bunch of really great ideas my favorite

15
00:00:28,890 --> 00:00:31,080
is that you know it's it's not your

16
00:00:31,080 --> 00:00:34,140
khakis which might be a deep cut but one

17
00:00:34,140 --> 00:00:36,090
of the definitions I really like came

18
00:00:36,090 --> 00:00:38,070
from this this cat here Andrew clay

19
00:00:38,070 --> 00:00:39,840
Schafer who may have heard of and he

20
00:00:39,840 --> 00:00:41,850
says it's optimizing human experience

21
00:00:41,850 --> 00:00:43,559
and performance of operating software

22
00:00:43,559 --> 00:00:45,120
which software in humans which means

23
00:00:45,120 --> 00:00:46,980
it's a socio technical system which

24
00:00:46,980 --> 00:00:49,289
means it involves people so I started

25
00:00:49,289 --> 00:00:50,910
thinking about this book the five love

26
00:00:50,910 --> 00:00:54,059
languages and like most self-help books

27
00:00:54,059 --> 00:00:55,260
I didn't read all of it but I read

28
00:00:55,260 --> 00:00:57,059
enough to understand that the basic idea

29
00:00:57,059 --> 00:00:58,469
is there's five different ways of

30
00:00:58,469 --> 00:01:00,390
communicating in a relationship and the

31
00:01:00,390 --> 00:01:02,219
trick is you need to learn your partners

32
00:01:02,219 --> 00:01:04,830
and learn to speak that one that's great

33
00:01:04,830 --> 00:01:07,140
you say but I care about shipping

34
00:01:07,140 --> 00:01:09,780
software this is DevOps not dev love ops

35
00:01:09,780 --> 00:01:12,360
which is a whole other conversation so

36
00:01:12,360 --> 00:01:13,979
what does this have to do with it right

37
00:01:13,979 --> 00:01:16,229
so let's take a step back and think

38
00:01:16,229 --> 00:01:19,040
about another way we talk about DevOps

39
00:01:19,040 --> 00:01:22,080
so these cats here came up with this

40
00:01:22,080 --> 00:01:24,150
idea of calm so that's John Willis Damon

41
00:01:24,150 --> 00:01:25,950
Edwards just humble and it's a way that

42
00:01:25,950 --> 00:01:27,869
we like to reason about DevOps being

43
00:01:27,869 --> 00:01:30,110
about culture automation lean

44
00:01:30,110 --> 00:01:32,759
measurement and sharing so notice there

45
00:01:32,759 --> 00:01:34,770
are five of them but what does this have

46
00:01:34,770 --> 00:01:36,630
to do with anything

47
00:01:36,630 --> 00:01:39,240
right like what's the point you're like

48
00:01:39,240 --> 00:01:41,520
okay five love languages and comms

49
00:01:41,520 --> 00:01:43,170
how do we put these things together

50
00:01:43,170 --> 00:01:49,340
here's how write each of these is a

51
00:01:49,340 --> 00:01:53,070
DevOps love language right the way that

52
00:01:53,070 --> 00:01:54,930
we understand DevOps and communicate

53
00:01:54,930 --> 00:01:57,329
about it Maps pretty neatly to which

54
00:01:57,329 --> 00:02:00,000
part of columns actually matters to us

55
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,070
and so I started thinking about how we

56
00:02:02,070 --> 00:02:03,869
can understand somebody else's DevOps

57
00:02:03,869 --> 00:02:05,369
love language and I went to this

58
00:02:05,369 --> 00:02:07,049
communication model called the disk

59
00:02:07,049 --> 00:02:09,209
right this is sometimes a little bit

60
00:02:09,209 --> 00:02:10,889
like a myers-briggs thing but really

61
00:02:10,889 --> 00:02:12,920
disk has to do with how we like to

62
00:02:12,920 --> 00:02:15,050
eunuch eight and there's four different

63
00:02:15,050 --> 00:02:16,940
kind of modalities of disc right

64
00:02:16,940 --> 00:02:18,620
dominant influencing studies and

65
00:02:18,620 --> 00:02:20,870
conscientious what happens is depending

66
00:02:20,870 --> 00:02:22,940
upon your disc preference it Maps really

67
00:02:22,940 --> 00:02:25,880
cleanly to a different part of comps so

68
00:02:25,880 --> 00:02:28,220
if you're a direct then things like lean

69
00:02:28,220 --> 00:02:30,590
and measurement parts of DevOps really

70
00:02:30,590 --> 00:02:32,540
speak to you right you know you're not

71
00:02:32,540 --> 00:02:34,160
as worried about the other things but if

72
00:02:34,160 --> 00:02:35,770
you're an influencing type and that

73
00:02:35,770 --> 00:02:37,400
doesn't mean like an Instagram

74
00:02:37,400 --> 00:02:40,280
influencer but it might so the culture

75
00:02:40,280 --> 00:02:43,220
and sharing aspects of DevOps resonate a

76
00:02:43,220 --> 00:02:46,160
lot more with you and similarly if you

77
00:02:46,160 --> 00:02:48,319
identify a little bit more on the disc

78
00:02:48,319 --> 00:02:51,170
model of steadiness and you can read a

79
00:02:51,170 --> 00:02:52,700
lot more about disc I only have five

80
00:02:52,700 --> 00:02:54,739
minutes automation and measurement

81
00:02:54,739 --> 00:02:56,630
really resonate where you go and you're

82
00:02:56,630 --> 00:02:58,580
not as concerned about the sharing and

83
00:02:58,580 --> 00:03:00,769
the culture and lean those things so if

84
00:03:00,769 --> 00:03:02,720
I try to talk to you about those things

85
00:03:02,720 --> 00:03:04,670
and you're a stateless person it won't

86
00:03:04,670 --> 00:03:06,640
hit and then finally conscientiousness

87
00:03:06,640 --> 00:03:09,350
is a conscientious is another part of

88
00:03:09,350 --> 00:03:11,959
disc and folks who line up in here

89
00:03:11,959 --> 00:03:13,910
sharing and measurement make a lot of

90
00:03:13,910 --> 00:03:16,400
sense to them and that's sort of the way

91
00:03:16,400 --> 00:03:18,049
and that's where you need to meet those

92
00:03:18,049 --> 00:03:20,299
folks to be able to speak about it the

93
00:03:20,299 --> 00:03:21,440
other thing that as you're talking about

94
00:03:21,440 --> 00:03:23,480
any kind of a change is you want to

95
00:03:23,480 --> 00:03:25,609
understand the drivers so this guy named

96
00:03:25,609 --> 00:03:28,609
Dan pink wrote a great book called Drive

97
00:03:28,609 --> 00:03:30,350
and it's an even better TED talk and you

98
00:03:30,350 --> 00:03:31,340
should check it out but the thing is

99
00:03:31,340 --> 00:03:33,049
what drives you doesn't necessarily

100
00:03:33,049 --> 00:03:35,989
drive someone else and I know we got an

101
00:03:35,989 --> 00:03:37,880
attack because we don't necessarily want

102
00:03:37,880 --> 00:03:39,739
to be salespeople but if you're trying

103
00:03:39,739 --> 00:03:41,720
to sell change you need to think about

104
00:03:41,720 --> 00:03:43,340
being a salesperson and think about

105
00:03:43,340 --> 00:03:45,260
challenging especially the model around

106
00:03:45,260 --> 00:03:47,359
the Challenger sale and how we can help

107
00:03:47,359 --> 00:03:48,920
people understand the things that they

108
00:03:48,920 --> 00:03:51,350
actually need but ultimately we have to

109
00:03:51,350 --> 00:03:54,230
speak their DevOps love language if you

110
00:03:54,230 --> 00:03:56,000
say this makes perfect sense to me but

111
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:57,920
they don't get it that's really more on

112
00:03:57,920 --> 00:03:59,870
you than it is on them you need to

113
00:03:59,870 --> 00:04:01,700
understand their drivers understand

114
00:04:01,700 --> 00:04:03,709
their DevOps love language and it'll

115
00:04:03,709 --> 00:04:05,810
make it a lot easier and then finally

116
00:04:05,810 --> 00:04:08,030
think about compliance versus commitment

117
00:04:08,030 --> 00:04:09,560
so a compliant person is someone who

118
00:04:09,560 --> 00:04:11,870
goes along with things because that's

119
00:04:11,870 --> 00:04:13,940
the process commitment means they

120
00:04:13,940 --> 00:04:16,160
believe in it and you want to get folks

121
00:04:16,160 --> 00:04:17,839
who are on the commitment train and you

122
00:04:17,839 --> 00:04:19,100
get them on the commitment train by

123
00:04:19,100 --> 00:04:21,709
speaking their language and if you want

124
00:04:21,709 --> 00:04:24,050
to make change remember this that the

125
00:04:24,050 --> 00:04:26,780
most effective change agents are the

126
00:04:26,780 --> 00:04:28,430
who don't see people as just this thing

127
00:04:28,430 --> 00:04:29,600
you have to deal with you actually

128
00:04:29,600 --> 00:04:33,320
embrace that socio part of socio

129
00:04:33,320 --> 00:04:36,080
technical systems and invite people

130
00:04:36,080 --> 00:04:38,840
along don't dictate don't make mandates

131
00:04:38,840 --> 00:04:41,600
have your ears open get their feedback

132
00:04:41,600 --> 00:04:44,120
get their ideas and that's the way that

133
00:04:44,120 --> 00:04:46,160
you're gonna all be able to speak devops

134
00:04:46,160 --> 00:04:48,380
love languages together and really make

135
00:04:48,380 --> 00:04:50,150
effective change in our organizations

136
00:04:50,150 --> 00:04:52,100
