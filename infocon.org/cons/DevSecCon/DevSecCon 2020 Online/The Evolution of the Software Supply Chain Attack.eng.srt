1
00:00:00,620 --> 00:00:03,090
lovely thank you very much so

2
00:00:03,090 --> 00:00:05,400
my name is Catherine and I'm the global

3
00:00:05,400 --> 00:00:07,200
director of solutions architecture at

4
00:00:07,200 --> 00:00:10,790
sono type so at some type I deal with

5
00:00:10,790 --> 00:00:14,070
software supply chain attacks all day

6
00:00:14,070 --> 00:00:16,830
long you know kind of coming in to

7
00:00:16,830 --> 00:00:20,250
Simon's talk just before myself the

8
00:00:20,250 --> 00:00:21,900
software supply chain attack is all

9
00:00:21,900 --> 00:00:23,820
about influencing the code that you

10
00:00:23,820 --> 00:00:26,310
don't own yet the stuff that you use in

11
00:00:26,310 --> 00:00:28,410
your software it's kind of in a mode of

12
00:00:28,410 --> 00:00:30,240
attack that you know I think we've all

13
00:00:30,240 --> 00:00:32,729
in the dev cycles sphere being talking

14
00:00:32,729 --> 00:00:34,950
about talking about for years and years

15
00:00:34,950 --> 00:00:38,160
and years but just as our practices

16
00:00:38,160 --> 00:00:40,620
evolved the mode of the attack need

17
00:00:40,620 --> 00:00:42,210
software supply chain attack itself

18
00:00:42,210 --> 00:00:44,940
evolves so what I thought I'd do are in

19
00:00:44,940 --> 00:00:47,520
this 15 minutes 15 minutes is walk you

20
00:00:47,520 --> 00:00:50,129
through the evolution of this software

21
00:00:50,129 --> 00:00:52,140
supply chain type of attack and just

22
00:00:52,140 --> 00:00:54,120
kind of walk you through the strategies

23
00:00:54,120 --> 00:00:58,020
of defending against each and every one

24
00:00:58,020 --> 00:01:00,930
of them so we all know software has even

25
00:01:00,930 --> 00:01:03,000
in the world it's 20/20 now you know

26
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:04,589
what a couple of world-changing events

27
00:01:04,589 --> 00:01:06,900
later here we are

28
00:01:06,900 --> 00:01:09,479
test line was spoken in 2010 by Mark

29
00:01:09,479 --> 00:01:12,119
Anderson but looking at it looking at

30
00:01:12,119 --> 00:01:14,580
with 10 years of hindsight one of the

31
00:01:14,580 --> 00:01:17,670
main culprits was open source as Simon

32
00:01:17,670 --> 00:01:19,020
mentioned you know depending on the

33
00:01:19,020 --> 00:01:20,250
programming language depending on the

34
00:01:20,250 --> 00:01:23,100
ecosystem various different types of

35
00:01:23,100 --> 00:01:26,250
software nowadays are mostly open source

36
00:01:26,250 --> 00:01:27,750
about depending on what report you read

37
00:01:27,750 --> 00:01:30,630
you can say that about a 75 to 90

38
00:01:30,630 --> 00:01:33,450
percent of your application is actually

39
00:01:33,450 --> 00:01:35,130
not your own it's either library

40
00:01:35,130 --> 00:01:37,110
libraries that you use libraries all of

41
00:01:37,110 --> 00:01:38,280
those libraries the transitive

42
00:01:38,280 --> 00:01:41,240
dependencies that you pulled in or the

43
00:01:41,240 --> 00:01:43,259
containers that you run them in the old

44
00:01:43,259 --> 00:01:44,790
burning system packages that you have

45
00:01:44,790 --> 00:01:47,759
them in as well open source helps us do

46
00:01:47,759 --> 00:01:49,680
our job that's why you use it right but

47
00:01:49,680 --> 00:01:53,340
just with any revolution or any change

48
00:01:53,340 --> 00:01:55,470
come with it comes with its own risks

49
00:01:55,470 --> 00:01:57,360
right the software supply chain attack

50
00:01:57,360 --> 00:01:59,189
has really been you know depending on

51
00:01:59,189 --> 00:02:01,430
who you talk to the kind of chosen

52
00:02:01,430 --> 00:02:04,320
chosen form of attack are in the cyber

53
00:02:04,320 --> 00:02:06,210
security industry over the last couple

54
00:02:06,210 --> 00:02:10,440
of years and it's many forms are now

55
00:02:10,440 --> 00:02:12,150
behind many of them and many of their

56
00:02:12,150 --> 00:02:13,340
bigger

57
00:02:13,340 --> 00:02:14,599
is that you see out there on the

58
00:02:14,599 --> 00:02:17,840
Internet so um so uh so I'm gonna go

59
00:02:17,840 --> 00:02:19,489
through a few of these just to kind of

60
00:02:19,489 --> 00:02:22,760
walk you through what they mean so um

61
00:02:22,760 --> 00:02:25,220
let's start with the basic software

62
00:02:25,220 --> 00:02:27,260
supply chain attack that was just

63
00:02:27,260 --> 00:02:28,670
demonstrated out just before myself

64
00:02:28,670 --> 00:02:32,299
right that is uh that is using known

65
00:02:32,299 --> 00:02:33,980
security vulnerabilities in these open

66
00:02:33,980 --> 00:02:36,230
source components and betting that you

67
00:02:36,230 --> 00:02:38,599
as a developer forget to update those

68
00:02:38,599 --> 00:02:41,480
dependencies right and it makes a ton of

69
00:02:41,480 --> 00:02:43,400
sense right you know as uh as I

70
00:02:43,400 --> 00:02:45,860
mentioned say 80 to 90% of your code is

71
00:02:45,860 --> 00:02:47,930
open source what that really means is

72
00:02:47,930 --> 00:02:51,650
that about is that you know typical Java

73
00:02:51,650 --> 00:02:53,989
project you have about a hundred to a

74
00:02:53,989 --> 00:02:55,970
hundred and ten different open source

75
00:02:55,970 --> 00:02:57,709
projects on average in the Java world

76
00:02:57,709 --> 00:02:59,150
especially when we were starting to use

77
00:02:59,150 --> 00:03:01,730
our libraries libraries to our

78
00:03:01,730 --> 00:03:03,590
boilerplate our projects we're talking

79
00:03:03,590 --> 00:03:05,209
about three to four hundred modules very

80
00:03:05,209 --> 00:03:06,920
very easily per project anyone who has

81
00:03:06,920 --> 00:03:08,660
ever looked into their nodule directory

82
00:03:08,660 --> 00:03:11,120
probably knows this joke for many many

83
00:03:11,120 --> 00:03:13,370
years right and he all started on many

84
00:03:13,370 --> 00:03:14,750
many years ago this type of attack is

85
00:03:14,750 --> 00:03:16,400
actually a lot older and a lot more

86
00:03:16,400 --> 00:03:18,440
impactful or earlier than we think

87
00:03:18,440 --> 00:03:20,959
right uh one of the first kind of proper

88
00:03:20,959 --> 00:03:23,120
examples of this type of attack of

89
00:03:23,120 --> 00:03:24,829
finding a known vulnerability and

90
00:03:24,829 --> 00:03:26,120
finding software that uses that

91
00:03:26,120 --> 00:03:28,519
particular dependency actually comes

92
00:03:28,519 --> 00:03:30,709
from 2015 with a common component course

93
00:03:30,709 --> 00:03:33,440
called Commons collections that is as

94
00:03:33,440 --> 00:03:35,690
the name suggests a very common piece of

95
00:03:35,690 --> 00:03:37,430
open source it's used for D

96
00:03:37,430 --> 00:03:40,970
serialization and what happened was it

97
00:03:40,970 --> 00:03:42,200
contained a vulnerability that allowed

98
00:03:42,200 --> 00:03:44,299
you to just like just like in the

99
00:03:44,299 --> 00:03:46,880
previous examples run your own code now

100
00:03:46,880 --> 00:03:48,650
what's interesting about this though is

101
00:03:48,650 --> 00:03:51,079
it's very very popular it sits on fairly

102
00:03:51,079 --> 00:03:54,349
many websites and in 2015 when they

103
00:03:54,349 --> 00:03:55,849
looked a new security vulnerability

104
00:03:55,849 --> 00:03:59,030
against it we saw that that

105
00:03:59,030 --> 00:04:01,370
vulnerability was actively used against

106
00:04:01,370 --> 00:04:02,989
the campaign that was really what made

107
00:04:02,989 --> 00:04:04,400
the name for software supply chain

108
00:04:04,400 --> 00:04:06,799
attacks it also had a huge impact for

109
00:04:06,799 --> 00:04:07,819
example it close to Hollywood

110
00:04:07,819 --> 00:04:12,590
Presbyterian Hospital in Los Angeles for

111
00:04:12,590 --> 00:04:14,090
a while because someone used this

112
00:04:14,090 --> 00:04:15,829
particular component to install

113
00:04:15,829 --> 00:04:19,160
ransomware on their computers what's

114
00:04:19,160 --> 00:04:20,988
more interesting is my employer sona

115
00:04:20,988 --> 00:04:23,300
type are sponsoring this so actually run

116
00:04:23,300 --> 00:04:25,820
maven central so we get to see the

117
00:04:25,820 --> 00:04:27,180
patterns of people downloading

118
00:04:27,180 --> 00:04:28,800
open-sourcing using them and when we

119
00:04:28,800 --> 00:04:30,780
looked at it a year later we saw that

120
00:04:30,780 --> 00:04:33,690
about 80% of all the downloads of this

121
00:04:33,690 --> 00:04:35,669
particular component we're still against

122
00:04:35,669 --> 00:04:39,449
that known vulnerable version well

123
00:04:39,449 --> 00:04:40,949
another good example of this type of

124
00:04:40,949 --> 00:04:42,750
attack is actually the one that made

125
00:04:42,750 --> 00:04:45,389
software supply chain a thing

126
00:04:45,389 --> 00:04:48,360
it's the 2017 struts to remote code

127
00:04:48,360 --> 00:04:50,639
execution vulnerability this is an

128
00:04:50,639 --> 00:04:52,740
interesting story because you know and

129
00:04:52,740 --> 00:04:54,090
I'm sure anyone in this circle has

130
00:04:54,090 --> 00:04:55,740
earlier many times but what's

131
00:04:55,740 --> 00:04:57,180
interesting about it isn't that there

132
00:04:57,180 --> 00:04:58,710
was an open source component and it was

133
00:04:58,710 --> 00:05:00,120
very popular and had a security

134
00:05:00,120 --> 00:05:02,190
vulnerability it's that it's the

135
00:05:02,190 --> 00:05:04,650
timeline of it what ended up happening

136
00:05:04,650 --> 00:05:08,310
was since since it was discovered within

137
00:05:08,310 --> 00:05:10,620
a day of it coming out so March the 7th

138
00:05:10,620 --> 00:05:12,780
in 2017 the Apache project logged a new

139
00:05:12,780 --> 00:05:15,570
security vulnerability on under the

140
00:05:15,570 --> 00:05:18,750
under the stretch project they released

141
00:05:18,750 --> 00:05:19,949
a fixed version they released an a

142
00:05:19,949 --> 00:05:21,570
notice to everybody saying hey this is

143
00:05:21,570 --> 00:05:23,699
now a thing what ended up happening

144
00:05:23,699 --> 00:05:26,340
though is the very next day the National

145
00:05:26,340 --> 00:05:29,880
Security Agency of the u.s. the phones

146
00:05:29,880 --> 00:05:31,949
that pentagon scanners themselves we're

147
00:05:31,949 --> 00:05:34,940
seeing our other nation states looking

148
00:05:34,940 --> 00:05:37,199
poking around the internet for servers

149
00:05:37,199 --> 00:05:40,199
with this vulnerable struts instance

150
00:05:40,199 --> 00:05:42,780
trying to run this exploitation code on

151
00:05:42,780 --> 00:05:45,780
the same day a exploitation code of that

152
00:05:45,780 --> 00:05:47,400
particular security vulnerability was

153
00:05:47,400 --> 00:05:49,080
published on to exploit DB there was

154
00:05:49,080 --> 00:05:51,780
also a POC on github and on the second

155
00:05:51,780 --> 00:05:54,270
day March the 9th cisco actually are

156
00:05:54,270 --> 00:05:56,460
later reported that they saw a huge

157
00:05:56,460 --> 00:05:58,110
number of exploitation events running

158
00:05:58,110 --> 00:05:59,880
through networks just packages blindly

159
00:05:59,880 --> 00:06:02,639
trying to see servers with this on March

160
00:06:02,639 --> 00:06:06,150
the 10th several well-known names our

161
00:06:06,150 --> 00:06:08,310
code exploited by this particular

162
00:06:08,310 --> 00:06:10,710
security vulnerability Equifax being one

163
00:06:10,710 --> 00:06:12,570
of the better known ones and you know

164
00:06:12,570 --> 00:06:14,190
three years later we all know that that

165
00:06:14,190 --> 00:06:17,699
was one of the biggest data leaks of the

166
00:06:17,699 --> 00:06:20,039
or decade but what was well less known

167
00:06:20,039 --> 00:06:22,139
is there were several other wig things

168
00:06:22,139 --> 00:06:24,270
including the Canadian Revenue Agency

169
00:06:24,270 --> 00:06:26,789
the okinawa power agency in japan the

170
00:06:26,789 --> 00:06:29,550
Aadhaar system in india and using that

171
00:06:29,550 --> 00:06:31,349
particular component we still saw

172
00:06:31,349 --> 00:06:33,120
several different types of iterations of

173
00:06:33,120 --> 00:06:34,919
the same attack not even against newer

174
00:06:34,919 --> 00:06:36,659
versions of that vulnerability but the

175
00:06:36,659 --> 00:06:38,969
exact same vulnerability for example in

176
00:06:38,969 --> 00:06:41,129
december 9 2017 the

177
00:06:41,129 --> 00:06:43,379
crypto mining campaigns and even today

178
00:06:43,379 --> 00:06:45,539
when we look at the stats and we look at

179
00:06:45,539 --> 00:06:47,959
how often this particular version of

180
00:06:47,959 --> 00:06:51,269
strats is downloaded we sit about 65% of

181
00:06:51,269 --> 00:06:53,489
the population still goes for these

182
00:06:53,489 --> 00:06:56,699
older more vulnerable versions so again

183
00:06:56,699 --> 00:06:58,349
it's a type of attack that preys on the

184
00:06:58,349 --> 00:07:00,179
fact that you as a developer are not

185
00:07:00,179 --> 00:07:02,519
remembering to go in and update your

186
00:07:02,519 --> 00:07:04,019
dependencies it has it's a known

187
00:07:04,019 --> 00:07:06,149
security vulnerability it sits there and

188
00:07:06,149 --> 00:07:09,300
it's being exploited but one of the

189
00:07:09,300 --> 00:07:10,830
things that this kind of a mode of

190
00:07:10,830 --> 00:07:14,069
attack proved was that was that you can

191
00:07:14,069 --> 00:07:16,199
take over the upstream you don't have to

192
00:07:16,199 --> 00:07:18,119
wait for a new security vulnerability to

193
00:07:18,119 --> 00:07:20,999
come into play in order to in order for

194
00:07:20,999 --> 00:07:23,399
you to arm execute a campaign you can

195
00:07:23,399 --> 00:07:24,689
just manufacture one of yourself

196
00:07:24,689 --> 00:07:26,939
probably the most famous example of this

197
00:07:26,939 --> 00:07:29,360
happened a year later in November 2018

198
00:07:29,360 --> 00:07:32,639
it was executed against a component

199
00:07:32,639 --> 00:07:35,249
called event stream which was

200
00:07:35,249 --> 00:07:37,349
compromised no this is a this was a

201
00:07:37,349 --> 00:07:38,789
pretty clever attack because this is

202
00:07:38,789 --> 00:07:40,879
really the first orchestrated campaign

203
00:07:40,879 --> 00:07:43,559
against an open-source component so what

204
00:07:43,559 --> 00:07:46,969
happened was a seemingly been a

205
00:07:46,969 --> 00:07:49,429
favorable stranger joint the project

206
00:07:49,429 --> 00:07:51,839
started contributing code eventually

207
00:07:51,839 --> 00:07:53,849
eventually they got committer rights to

208
00:07:53,849 --> 00:07:55,800
that repository what actually happened

209
00:07:55,800 --> 00:07:58,649
was they introduced some particularly

210
00:07:58,649 --> 00:08:01,800
obviously malicious code in that in that

211
00:08:01,800 --> 00:08:03,719
open source component now everybody

212
00:08:03,719 --> 00:08:05,039
noticed that in fact I think it took

213
00:08:05,039 --> 00:08:06,809
about two hours for that vulnerability

214
00:08:06,809 --> 00:08:08,789
degree publicized but what wasn't

215
00:08:08,789 --> 00:08:10,740
publicized was that actually they

216
00:08:10,740 --> 00:08:13,409
cleverly hidden another vulnerability in

217
00:08:13,409 --> 00:08:15,240
an earlier version so when the newest

218
00:08:15,240 --> 00:08:16,800
latest version was discovered to be

219
00:08:16,800 --> 00:08:19,019
vulnerable what usually happens is these

220
00:08:19,019 --> 00:08:21,059
links get posted on slack people are

221
00:08:21,059 --> 00:08:23,879
downgraded to you know in oneness one

222
00:08:23,879 --> 00:08:25,499
and that actually contained a targeted

223
00:08:25,499 --> 00:08:27,209
campaign against a crypto mining

224
00:08:27,209 --> 00:08:34,169
cryptocurrency and winning and snuck

225
00:08:34,169 --> 00:08:38,490
away with wallet wallet contents so this

226
00:08:38,490 --> 00:08:40,500
was the beginning a beginning of an ad

227
00:08:40,500 --> 00:08:42,360
type of attack where not only are we

228
00:08:42,360 --> 00:08:44,610
trying to influence find open source

229
00:08:44,610 --> 00:08:46,860
that's clearly really federated itself

230
00:08:46,860 --> 00:08:48,990
onto your software we're actually going

231
00:08:48,990 --> 00:08:50,579
back to the source and we're trying to

232
00:08:50,579 --> 00:08:53,550
influence the code itself so when you

233
00:08:53,550 --> 00:08:55,080
start throwing these out on a map

234
00:08:55,080 --> 00:08:56,940
you actually start seeing a pattern you

235
00:08:56,940 --> 00:08:58,410
know there's plenty of a plenty of

236
00:08:58,410 --> 00:09:00,030
attacks and not enough to talk about in

237
00:09:00,030 --> 00:09:02,100
15 minutes but what you do notice though

238
00:09:02,100 --> 00:09:05,220
is often these are these are attacks

239
00:09:05,220 --> 00:09:08,880
that or harbingers of each other for

240
00:09:08,880 --> 00:09:10,710
example in January 2018 there was a

241
00:09:10,710 --> 00:09:12,300
famous medium article that went around

242
00:09:12,300 --> 00:09:15,240
that spoke about harvesting credit card

243
00:09:15,240 --> 00:09:16,920
numbers using a bogus JavaScript attack

244
00:09:16,920 --> 00:09:19,230
it was kind of a parody that was written

245
00:09:19,230 --> 00:09:22,260
but by the September of the exact same

246
00:09:22,260 --> 00:09:24,420
year that exact mode of attack happened

247
00:09:24,420 --> 00:09:26,070
with a small company called

248
00:09:26,070 --> 00:09:29,670
British Airways where one of their one

249
00:09:29,670 --> 00:09:31,560
of their our JavaScript libraries that

250
00:09:31,560 --> 00:09:33,540
was sat on their payment page was

251
00:09:33,540 --> 00:09:36,960
poisoned by an external attack in a

252
00:09:36,960 --> 00:09:38,460
campaign where it started actually

253
00:09:38,460 --> 00:09:41,010
sending credit card numbers away from

254
00:09:41,010 --> 00:09:43,710
that payment form so in some ways the

255
00:09:43,710 --> 00:09:45,840
prediction became the harbinger of those

256
00:09:45,840 --> 00:09:47,850
types of attacks and open what we see is

257
00:09:47,850 --> 00:09:49,830
when a new type of software supply chain

258
00:09:49,830 --> 00:09:51,420
attacks in occurs in one ecosystem

259
00:09:51,420 --> 00:09:53,100
there's some kind of prince looking at

260
00:09:53,100 --> 00:09:55,320
it trying to replicate it in elsewhere

261
00:09:55,320 --> 00:09:58,380
so good news is readable defenses you

262
00:09:58,380 --> 00:10:01,320
know my employer and others came out

263
00:10:01,320 --> 00:10:03,360
with tools that help you understand what

264
00:10:03,360 --> 00:10:05,100
opens you have helped you bump these

265
00:10:05,100 --> 00:10:06,810
versions give you pull requests give you

266
00:10:06,810 --> 00:10:09,210
banners and github give you all the

267
00:10:09,210 --> 00:10:10,920
badges that you need to tell your

268
00:10:10,920 --> 00:10:13,220
community that you've got trouble but

269
00:10:13,220 --> 00:10:17,340
but so too did the but fundamentally

270
00:10:17,340 --> 00:10:19,470
what we ended up doing was automating

271
00:10:19,470 --> 00:10:21,330
this for all your projects what we

272
00:10:21,330 --> 00:10:24,540
really did we go my final my excellent

273
00:10:24,540 --> 00:10:26,790
animation that I'm running here what we

274
00:10:26,790 --> 00:10:28,620
did was really go through each and every

275
00:10:28,620 --> 00:10:30,930
one of the components on the list and

276
00:10:30,930 --> 00:10:32,130
ask the question are there known

277
00:10:32,130 --> 00:10:33,510
security wannabes on this are there

278
00:10:33,510 --> 00:10:34,920
known security vulnerabilities on this

279
00:10:34,920 --> 00:10:36,330
or the known security vulnerabilities on

280
00:10:36,330 --> 00:10:38,240
this and to encourage upgrading

281
00:10:38,240 --> 00:10:40,080
fundamentally that's really what all of

282
00:10:40,080 --> 00:10:41,640
these kind of go through but

283
00:10:41,640 --> 00:10:44,040
unfortunately the attack types have

284
00:10:44,040 --> 00:10:46,200
evolved as well they've actually also

285
00:10:46,200 --> 00:10:51,870
taken or taken a new form to to attack

286
00:10:51,870 --> 00:10:54,360
you as well this was described just a

287
00:10:54,360 --> 00:10:56,400
couple of weeks ago by github the new

288
00:10:56,400 --> 00:10:58,230
new type of attack called octopus

289
00:10:58,230 --> 00:11:00,030
scanner it's an interesting type of

290
00:11:00,030 --> 00:11:02,310
attack because it comes with your open

291
00:11:02,310 --> 00:11:03,450
source or other projects that you might

292
00:11:03,450 --> 00:11:05,070
download from github and in fact about

293
00:11:05,070 --> 00:11:07,440
26 are dependencies there but it goes

294
00:11:07,440 --> 00:11:08,940
after against a relatively

295
00:11:08,940 --> 00:11:11,670
popular IDE called NetBeans witches are

296
00:11:11,670 --> 00:11:14,220
used in the Java world very old for us

297
00:11:14,220 --> 00:11:17,010
who have been actually using it now it's

298
00:11:17,010 --> 00:11:18,510
an interesting thing because what it

299
00:11:18,510 --> 00:11:20,340
does it actually contains a malicious

300
00:11:20,340 --> 00:11:21,930
file called cache dot that which is

301
00:11:21,930 --> 00:11:23,610
injected into your net based project

302
00:11:23,610 --> 00:11:26,190
directory now what happens is it

303
00:11:26,190 --> 00:11:27,540
actually Sneed's itself into the build

304
00:11:27,540 --> 00:11:29,790
system every time you build cold whit

305
00:11:29,790 --> 00:11:31,950
NetBeans this cache that the file

306
00:11:31,950 --> 00:11:33,410
contains some code that is executed

307
00:11:33,410 --> 00:11:35,880
whilst you build the code and what it

308
00:11:35,880 --> 00:11:37,650
actually happens is it goes ahead and

309
00:11:37,650 --> 00:11:39,990
infects all the class files that you're

310
00:11:39,990 --> 00:11:42,540
producing and all the nested jars that

311
00:11:42,540 --> 00:11:44,400
you generate are inside of your own

312
00:11:44,400 --> 00:11:46,920
project so he adds its own code into it

313
00:11:46,920 --> 00:11:49,110
now this code goes on to live somewhere

314
00:11:49,110 --> 00:11:50,550
else and goes on to infect other

315
00:11:50,550 --> 00:11:52,140
projects and in fact other projects and

316
00:11:52,140 --> 00:11:53,880
other projects or other projects etc and

317
00:11:53,880 --> 00:11:55,950
for good measure it also goes ahead and

318
00:11:55,950 --> 00:11:58,830
backdoors your own machine and it

319
00:11:58,830 --> 00:12:01,200
introduces it into into a botnet that

320
00:12:01,200 --> 00:12:02,880
can be that can then retrieve and

321
00:12:02,880 --> 00:12:04,770
execute some commands from some command

322
00:12:04,770 --> 00:12:07,110
and control server somewhere else pretty

323
00:12:07,110 --> 00:12:09,810
scary stuff and it also runs on pretty

324
00:12:09,810 --> 00:12:11,100
much everything then and the kitchen

325
00:12:11,100 --> 00:12:14,340
sink so that's the thought that I want

326
00:12:14,340 --> 00:12:17,400
to leave you all with today what you

327
00:12:17,400 --> 00:12:19,320
don't no longer need to do is just look

328
00:12:19,320 --> 00:12:21,570
at the name unfortunately this attack

329
00:12:21,570 --> 00:12:24,150
probably bears the message type of

330
00:12:24,150 --> 00:12:25,650
attack bears the message that in the

331
00:12:25,650 --> 00:12:28,020
future in the future there's gonna be

332
00:12:28,020 --> 00:12:29,610
other types of attack that deliver its

333
00:12:29,610 --> 00:12:31,770
target not your own code but your

334
00:12:31,770 --> 00:12:33,780
development environment and what you

335
00:12:33,780 --> 00:12:35,580
need to be doing is not only looking at

336
00:12:35,580 --> 00:12:37,260
known security vulnerabilities in known

337
00:12:37,260 --> 00:12:39,360
exploits but also whether or not your

338
00:12:39,360 --> 00:12:41,070
code is a hundred percent open-source

339
00:12:41,070 --> 00:12:43,050
canonical now there are tools like my

340
00:12:43,050 --> 00:12:44,910
employers that can help you do that and

341
00:12:44,910 --> 00:12:47,250
identify completely unknown and slightly

342
00:12:47,250 --> 00:12:51,030
modified components but the final thing

343
00:12:51,030 --> 00:12:53,310
to understand is controlling that list

344
00:12:53,310 --> 00:12:55,560
unfortunately no longer is enough you

345
00:12:55,560 --> 00:12:58,200
need to go deeper and find out what is

346
00:12:58,200 --> 00:13:00,270
going on with these codes in order to

347
00:13:00,270 --> 00:13:01,920
state these off it's a it's a

348
00:13:01,920 --> 00:13:03,510
interesting future that we're developing

349
00:13:03,510 --> 00:13:04,980
and I'm sure we're going to see many of

350
00:13:04,980 --> 00:13:08,190
iterations of this going forward as well

351
00:13:08,190 --> 00:13:11,970
so give it a go see if you've got it

352
00:13:11,970 --> 00:13:14,790
yourself come talk to us on our stand at

353
00:13:14,790 --> 00:13:16,710
some type and we'll be glad to answer

354
00:13:16,710 --> 00:13:19,700
any questions for you too
