ahead for is yours

9
00:00:21,590 --> 00:00:28,650
sure hi everyone it's no secret that

10
00:00:28,650 --> 00:00:31,109
women are underrepresented in the tech

11
00:00:31,109 --> 00:00:34,260
industry when considering the security

12
00:00:34,260 --> 00:00:37,829
world the numbers are even worse some

13
00:00:37,829 --> 00:00:41,040
say that this is a given natural fact

14
00:00:41,040 --> 00:00:43,110
and that there's virtually nothing we

15
00:00:43,110 --> 00:00:46,860
can do about it well sorry to burst your

16
00:00:46,860 --> 00:00:49,829
bubble but you're probably doing it

17
00:00:49,829 --> 00:00:52,260
wrong there isn't nothing anything

18
00:00:52,260 --> 00:00:54,809
natural about it you can make a

19
00:00:54,809 --> 00:00:57,480
difference just by doing some things

20
00:00:57,480 --> 00:01:01,050
differently some are quicker than others

21
00:01:01,050 --> 00:01:04,229
and can be regarded as quick wins while

22
00:01:04,229 --> 00:01:07,229
others require deep and profound changes

23
00:01:07,229 --> 00:01:10,830
into your company's culture today we

24
00:01:10,830 --> 00:01:13,110
will focus on the quick wins about

25
00:01:13,110 --> 00:01:18,270
editing your job descriptions I will

26
00:01:18,270 --> 00:01:20,729
give practical and scientifically backed

27
00:01:20,729 --> 00:01:23,430
as scientifically backed up techniques

28
00:01:23,430 --> 00:01:26,280
to adjust your job descriptions in order

29
00:01:26,280 --> 00:01:28,920
to attract more women into tech

30
00:01:28,920 --> 00:01:31,950
positions into your company well I

31
00:01:31,950 --> 00:01:34,979
didn't introduce myself yet so hi my

32
00:01:34,979 --> 00:01:37,110
name is Luanne Webber I'm a social

33
00:01:37,110 --> 00:01:39,299
entrepreneur I recently founded a

34
00:01:39,299 --> 00:01:42,119
platform called women on stage net

35
00:01:42,119 --> 00:01:45,360
you're more than welcome to check it out

36
00:01:45,360 --> 00:01:48,240
I'm also I'm a software developer I have

37
00:01:48,240 --> 00:01:50,159
10 years of experience as a software

38
00:01:50,159 --> 00:01:52,829
developer I was working at Wix up until

39
00:01:52,829 --> 00:01:55,829
recently and other than that I'm also a

40
00:01:55,829 --> 00:01:58,770
social psychologist which means I have

41
00:01:58,770 --> 00:02:00,719
the master degree in social psychology

42
00:02:00,719 --> 00:02:04,170
and I have gathered this list I'm about

43
00:02:04,170 --> 00:02:07,530
to to give you based on my academic

44
00:02:07,530 --> 00:02:09,380
background and

45
00:02:09,380 --> 00:02:12,890
as a women in tech myself and online

46
00:02:12,890 --> 00:02:15,410
based on my experience as a woman in

47
00:02:15,410 --> 00:02:19,390
tech myself for the past ten years

48
00:02:19,720 --> 00:02:23,450
before I start I want to say that it's

49
00:02:23,450 --> 00:02:26,450
really really important to say that I do

50
00:02:26,450 --> 00:02:31,150
not by no means I do not mean hiring

51
00:02:31,150 --> 00:02:34,490
under qualified applicants just because

52
00:02:34,490 --> 00:02:37,670
they're women that's really not what I'm

53
00:02:37,670 --> 00:02:41,570
suggesting what I'm suggesting is to

54
00:02:41,570 --> 00:02:44,390
broaden our search and to change the way

55
00:02:44,390 --> 00:02:47,570
we look for new candidates in places we

56
00:02:47,570 --> 00:02:52,730
didn't think about before so let us

57
00:02:52,730 --> 00:02:55,220
start our journey in making sure that

58
00:02:55,220 --> 00:02:57,620
your job descriptions are more inclusive

59
00:02:57,620 --> 00:03:02,360
to women number one you need to specify

60
00:03:02,360 --> 00:03:06,410
your real must-haves say for example

61
00:03:06,410 --> 00:03:09,500
that your job description states that

62
00:03:09,500 --> 00:03:12,110
you're looking for someone who has eight

63
00:03:12,110 --> 00:03:14,510
years of experience but you'll actually

64
00:03:14,510 --> 00:03:17,420
settle with one who has only four years

65
00:03:17,420 --> 00:03:19,850
of experience don't write that as a

66
00:03:19,850 --> 00:03:22,340
minimum requirement and write that as a

67
00:03:22,340 --> 00:03:23,360
nice-to-have

68
00:03:23,360 --> 00:03:25,970
that's because research has shown that

69
00:03:25,970 --> 00:03:28,760
women tend to apply to job descriptions

70
00:03:28,760 --> 00:03:33,320
only if they fit 100% of the criteria

71
00:03:33,320 --> 00:03:34,850
check check check check check

72
00:03:34,850 --> 00:03:38,209
whereas men usually apply if there is

73
00:03:38,209 --> 00:03:42,070
and they settle only at sixty percent

74
00:03:42,070 --> 00:03:46,310
number two avoid superlatives and terms

75
00:03:46,310 --> 00:03:50,410
like ninja rock star superstar

76
00:03:50,410 --> 00:03:53,750
once again research has shown that women

77
00:03:53,750 --> 00:03:56,420
rarely identify with those terms which

78
00:03:56,420 --> 00:03:59,600
are so common in job descriptions and

79
00:03:59,600 --> 00:04:03,170
this will are often more often will the

80
00:04:03,170 --> 00:04:08,840
not will will will will cause them to

81
00:04:08,840 --> 00:04:11,780
withdraw their application and here's a

82
00:04:11,780 --> 00:04:15,590
really funny example for that this is

83
00:04:15,590 --> 00:04:20,269
someone I know our rock star ninja guru

84
00:04:20,269 --> 00:04:21,250
developer

85
00:04:21,250 --> 00:04:25,410
never met a job description I don't fit

86
00:04:25,410 --> 00:04:28,180
generally speaking you really need to

87
00:04:28,180 --> 00:04:30,370
choose your language carefully and to

88
00:04:30,370 --> 00:04:33,520
keep it as neutral as you can if you're

89
00:04:33,520 --> 00:04:36,370
using a language which is not gender

90
00:04:36,370 --> 00:04:40,450
neutral such as Ebru German or French a

91
00:04:40,450 --> 00:04:42,010
neighbor for instance there is a

92
00:04:42,010 --> 00:04:44,380
different form for its female developer

93
00:04:44,380 --> 00:04:47,440
and a male developer do not use the

94
00:04:47,440 --> 00:04:50,710
masculine form always keep it as neutral

95
00:04:50,710 --> 00:04:54,700
as you can and number four if your job

96
00:04:54,700 --> 00:04:58,030
description include images verify that

97
00:04:58,030 --> 00:05:01,030
those images are diverse and that they

98
00:05:01,030 --> 00:05:04,720
include women count the men women ratio

99
00:05:04,720 --> 00:05:07,630
in your photos verify that those women

100
00:05:07,630 --> 00:05:10,990
are upfront active and doing the same

101
00:05:10,990 --> 00:05:14,320
job as demand and not serving coffee in

102
00:05:14,320 --> 00:05:15,910
the back or something like that

103
00:05:15,910 --> 00:05:20,020
here are some good examples of diverse

104
00:05:20,020 --> 00:05:23,020
images by the way diversity and images

105
00:05:23,020 --> 00:05:25,810
should also apply to different

106
00:05:25,810 --> 00:05:29,169
ethnicities races different age groups

107
00:05:29,169 --> 00:05:33,910
people of disabilities LGBTQ etc so here

108
00:05:33,910 --> 00:05:37,450
are some good examples and here are some

109
00:05:37,450 --> 00:05:40,810
bad examples the first image are the

110
00:05:40,810 --> 00:05:44,080
upper image those are all white males

111
00:05:44,080 --> 00:05:46,750
and the second one which is also quite

112
00:05:46,750 --> 00:05:50,020
common to job descriptions assumes he is

113
00:05:50,020 --> 00:05:52,900
a programmer and she is a designer and

114
00:05:52,900 --> 00:05:54,910
God forbid that it will be the other way

115
00:05:54,910 --> 00:05:56,190
around

116
00:05:56,190 --> 00:05:59,770
so let us recap on how to make our job

117
00:05:59,770 --> 00:06:02,770
descriptions more inclusive number one

118
00:06:02,770 --> 00:06:06,490
specify your real must-haves number two

119
00:06:06,490 --> 00:06:09,490
avoid termed like ninja rock star or

120
00:06:09,490 --> 00:06:10,630
superstar

121
00:06:10,630 --> 00:06:13,180
number three always choose your language

122
00:06:13,180 --> 00:06:15,340
carefully and keep it as neutral as you

123
00:06:15,340 --> 00:06:18,669
can and number four include diverse

124
00:06:18,669 --> 00:06:21,550
images and if there's something you're

125
00:06:21,550 --> 00:06:24,130
not sure enough and you're not sure

126
00:06:24,130 --> 00:06:26,650
about and you don't know if it's

127
00:06:26,650 --> 00:06:29,590
inclusive enough just ask a female

128
00:06:29,590 --> 00:06:32,050
friend and she will tell you if it's

129
00:06:32,050 --> 00:06:34,610
inclusive for her and if it's appealing

130
00:06:34,610 --> 00:06:38,330
for her thank you you're more than

around like what you should also avoid

141
00:07:05,539 --> 00:07:08,330
rights like sometimes you set traps for

142
00:07:08,330 --> 00:07:11,360
