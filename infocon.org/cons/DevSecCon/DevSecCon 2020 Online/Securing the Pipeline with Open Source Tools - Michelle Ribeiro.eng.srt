1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,149
hi my name is Misha Ribeiro and I am the

2
00:00:03,149 --> 00:00:05,790
CEO of spirit sank a Brazilian cyber

3
00:00:05,790 --> 00:00:09,320
security company before I start let me

4
00:00:09,320 --> 00:00:12,210
appreciate all the work done by the

5
00:00:12,210 --> 00:00:15,719
organizers hosts other speakers and of

6
00:00:15,719 --> 00:00:17,310
course our sponsors

7
00:00:17,310 --> 00:00:20,039
it's an honor to me to be speaking up

8
00:00:20,039 --> 00:00:23,279
that psycho and I hope you enjoy our

9
00:00:23,279 --> 00:00:28,320
time together okay a little bit about me

10
00:00:28,320 --> 00:00:31,050
I work with Linux and open source

11
00:00:31,050 --> 00:00:35,270
security technologies since 1999

12
00:00:35,270 --> 00:00:37,230
supporting governments and other

13
00:00:37,230 --> 00:00:39,829
organizations chat up the latest

14
00:00:39,829 --> 00:00:43,110
security technologies I have been

15
00:00:43,110 --> 00:00:46,820
involved with the Debian project and

16
00:00:46,820 --> 00:00:51,510
today's community as well I have a

17
00:00:51,510 --> 00:00:55,550
b-side where I advise technologies I

18
00:00:55,550 --> 00:00:58,289
advise comments about technologies and

19
00:00:58,289 --> 00:01:01,219
international security as well okay

20
00:01:01,219 --> 00:01:05,280
enough about me what is our agenda for

21
00:01:05,280 --> 00:01:10,890
the next minutes well first let's talk

22
00:01:10,890 --> 00:01:12,840
about our goal here my main goal for

23
00:01:12,840 --> 00:01:15,990
this talk is to simplify your journey

24
00:01:15,990 --> 00:01:20,369
into deficit cops so you can get early

25
00:01:20,369 --> 00:01:22,619
and significant results to your

26
00:01:22,619 --> 00:01:25,920
organization using open source tools to

27
00:01:25,920 --> 00:01:30,780
secure your development pipeline or

28
00:01:30,780 --> 00:01:33,329
agenda is the phone he will start of

29
00:01:33,329 --> 00:01:35,670
course defining what is that Cecrops

30
00:01:35,670 --> 00:01:38,340
then he will talk about how to introduce

31
00:01:38,340 --> 00:01:43,740
secured until DevOps future and lastly

32
00:01:43,740 --> 00:01:47,460
how to secure DevOps meant dumb design

33
00:01:47,460 --> 00:01:50,220
technologies using open source tools

34
00:01:50,220 --> 00:01:53,579
okay so to better understand what that

35
00:01:53,579 --> 00:01:58,439
SEC Ops is he have to first revise how

36
00:01:58,439 --> 00:02:01,530
he used to handle security before the

37
00:02:01,530 --> 00:02:02,280
DevOps

38
00:02:02,280 --> 00:02:07,259
moment so in the age of the waterfall

39
00:02:07,259 --> 00:02:10,348
security in the waterfall development as

40
00:02:10,348 --> 00:02:13,620
well he introduces

41
00:02:13,620 --> 00:02:15,989
a series of sequential process to get

42
00:02:15,989 --> 00:02:19,110
her code out and into the world from a

43
00:02:19,110 --> 00:02:21,980
security standpoint of vo he act like

44
00:02:21,980 --> 00:02:25,440
gatekeepers we for roll easily to the

45
00:02:25,440 --> 00:02:29,129
final stages of the development he was

46
00:02:29,129 --> 00:02:33,209
to schedule secured turned it and to

47
00:02:33,209 --> 00:02:36,420
revise the application codes but only

48
00:02:36,420 --> 00:02:38,909
after everything was done when the

49
00:02:38,909 --> 00:02:41,579
developers believed that the worker was

50
00:02:41,579 --> 00:02:44,790
fully completed he graded this code

51
00:02:44,790 --> 00:02:48,870
against a series of requirements in a

52
00:02:48,870 --> 00:02:53,879
predefined and started static list after

53
00:02:53,879 --> 00:02:59,280
days or weeks TGIF we have a hundreds of

54
00:02:59,280 --> 00:03:03,450
page that almost no one read now went to

55
00:03:03,450 --> 00:03:05,609
the first sea level

56
00:03:05,609 --> 00:03:08,760
first to the sea levels executives and

57
00:03:08,760 --> 00:03:11,640
took another pair of weeks to reach the

58
00:03:11,640 --> 00:03:14,940
developers and operators to revise the

59
00:03:14,940 --> 00:03:18,590
code and make the necessary adjustments

60
00:03:18,590 --> 00:03:22,650
and only the company lost time and money

61
00:03:22,650 --> 00:03:25,919
not by not separating the secure code

62
00:03:25,919 --> 00:03:31,010
from the on a private one but he fail to

63
00:03:31,010 --> 00:03:35,389
deploy they required women they required

64
00:03:35,389 --> 00:03:39,980
chains or sometimes the code and

65
00:03:39,980 --> 00:03:44,000
application went into production and

66
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:49,010
anyway and we know where this this

67
00:03:49,010 --> 00:03:55,470
finish right with the thought he could

68
00:03:55,470 --> 00:04:01,410
ensure a faster development cycles but

69
00:04:01,410 --> 00:04:03,870
our security Pratt's remained very

70
00:04:03,870 --> 00:04:08,519
updated so and this can do even the most

71
00:04:08,519 --> 00:04:13,620
agile in its DevOps initiative right I'm

72
00:04:13,620 --> 00:04:16,949
sure almost everyone has experienced a

73
00:04:16,949 --> 00:04:20,190
successful deploy that as affected by

74
00:04:20,190 --> 00:04:21,839
the rules of the Web Application

75
00:04:21,839 --> 00:04:27,600
Firewall and I think time here

76
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:30,270
in there of automated tracks that

77
00:04:30,270 --> 00:04:34,740
require automated response there is some

78
00:04:34,740 --> 00:04:37,470
studies that say that 58 percent of the

79
00:04:37,470 --> 00:04:40,950
web traffic comes from human and 22

80
00:04:40,950 --> 00:04:45,300
Kings from that goats and this number is

81
00:04:45,300 --> 00:04:52,170
only expected to change so one of the

82
00:04:52,170 --> 00:04:54,240
main challenges for

83
00:04:54,240 --> 00:05:01,530
InfoSec pros are to bring their their

84
00:05:01,530 --> 00:05:03,900
game from a reactive one to approach

85
00:05:03,900 --> 00:05:10,200
it's a huge you need to integrate

86
00:05:10,200 --> 00:05:13,590
security ensure pipelines from end to

87
00:05:13,590 --> 00:05:16,610
end he needs to listen true lies and

88
00:05:16,610 --> 00:05:19,620
ultimate vulnerability assessments and

89
00:05:19,620 --> 00:05:23,190
give developers fast for the back so

90
00:05:23,190 --> 00:05:27,780
they can to empower and make in have the

91
00:05:27,780 --> 00:05:30,930
necessary training to fix to make

92
00:05:30,930 --> 00:05:34,620
security assessment and fix different

93
00:05:34,620 --> 00:05:37,170
abilities that they find as faster as

94
00:05:37,170 --> 00:05:42,270
possible okay so here understanding the

95
00:05:42,270 --> 00:05:45,900
problem that we have and he now

96
00:05:45,900 --> 00:05:49,800
understand what kind of solution he

97
00:05:49,800 --> 00:05:54,120
would need and how the Delphi cups is

98
00:05:54,120 --> 00:05:58,740
the answer to all that I really like the

99
00:05:58,740 --> 00:06:04,290
way that is NIC the CIO guy define

100
00:06:04,290 --> 00:06:07,950
there's a cop's his explanation is the

101
00:06:07,950 --> 00:06:10,340
following

102
00:06:10,400 --> 00:06:16,830
sorry if the Rob's is composed of DevOps

103
00:06:16,830 --> 00:06:20,610
future metal dollars and technologists

104
00:06:20,610 --> 00:06:23,700
so that's a cop's

105
00:06:23,700 --> 00:06:27,750
should mean to introduce security into

106
00:06:27,750 --> 00:06:30,590
the rocks future to secure the web's

107
00:06:30,590 --> 00:06:34,430
methodologies and to write simple right

108
00:06:34,430 --> 00:06:35,560
okay

109
00:06:35,560 --> 00:06:42,580
but how and if you are the verbs leader

110
00:06:42,580 --> 00:06:45,580
I really strongly advise you to give a

111
00:06:45,580 --> 00:06:48,970
special attention to the concept of CIS

112
00:06:48,970 --> 00:06:52,180
eg because something difficult for

113
00:06:52,180 --> 00:06:55,930
InfoSec cross he'll understand so keep

114
00:06:55,930 --> 00:06:58,360
in mind the continuous its back

115
00:06:58,360 --> 00:07:00,010
I'm sure the integration continuous

116
00:07:00,010 --> 00:07:05,740
deployment and maybe to how can you say

117
00:07:05,740 --> 00:07:06,720
that in English

118
00:07:06,720 --> 00:07:10,960
maybe is a to her token side for us so

119
00:07:10,960 --> 00:07:16,150
help us by making your constructor or

120
00:07:16,150 --> 00:07:19,620
own pipeline this will be great for us

121
00:07:19,620 --> 00:07:25,960
okay um what else this the concept of

122
00:07:25,960 --> 00:07:28,229
shared ownership this is so important

123
00:07:28,229 --> 00:07:31,419
and this is a number that I like and

124
00:07:31,419 --> 00:07:35,620
almost every security manager loves as

125
00:07:35,620 --> 00:07:40,000
well there is some research that say

126
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:43,660
that for any team of the ropes you have

127
00:07:43,660 --> 00:07:48,490
100 deaths ten ops and just one security

128
00:07:48,490 --> 00:07:50,770
professional this is our word that he

129
00:07:50,770 --> 00:07:54,340
are losing guys so it's good to have

130
00:07:54,340 --> 00:07:59,500
more soldiers on board right so think

131
00:07:59,500 --> 00:08:03,910
about who assumes responsibilities for

132
00:08:03,910 --> 00:08:08,220
across all the chains do the chains

133
00:08:08,220 --> 00:08:10,990
received security education as

134
00:08:10,990 --> 00:08:14,580
guidelines and pulse they feel

135
00:08:14,580 --> 00:08:18,130
responsible and empowered to check

136
00:08:18,130 --> 00:08:22,830
security to make secure assessments

137
00:08:24,419 --> 00:08:36,400
ideally ideally a developer should be

138
00:08:36,400 --> 00:08:39,400
familiar with the fundamentals of

139
00:08:39,400 --> 00:08:42,780
security concepts such as this privilege

140
00:08:42,780 --> 00:08:47,070
cryptography that secures in privacy and

141
00:08:47,070 --> 00:08:49,270
this if

142
00:08:49,270 --> 00:08:52,450
SEC pros are one of the best guys to to

143
00:08:52,450 --> 00:08:57,280
talk about this so create programs among

144
00:08:57,280 --> 00:09:00,670
the chins can work together transferring

145
00:09:00,670 --> 00:09:06,490
knowledge between them creating and

146
00:09:06,490 --> 00:09:08,470
sharing mechanism or tools to ensure

147
00:09:08,470 --> 00:09:10,480
security of your applications and

148
00:09:10,480 --> 00:09:14,110
platforms it's a great way to do it you

149
00:09:14,110 --> 00:09:18,280
can create libraries and out education

150
00:09:18,280 --> 00:09:21,520
then crepitation serves directors for

151
00:09:21,520 --> 00:09:24,600
example with everything available and

152
00:09:24,600 --> 00:09:27,610
easily searchable it's easier for

153
00:09:27,610 --> 00:09:30,910
developers and operators to reuse the

154
00:09:30,910 --> 00:09:35,080
secure code and disappeared scripts you

155
00:09:35,080 --> 00:09:38,860
can create standard images with the most

156
00:09:38,860 --> 00:09:42,640
use it systems such as partial databases

157
00:09:42,640 --> 00:09:50,460
for example and when possible try to use

158
00:09:52,830 --> 00:09:57,180
DevOps tools to handle security issues

159
00:09:57,180 --> 00:10:00,040
most of the companies that are in

160
00:10:00,040 --> 00:10:05,530
between that gym adopt the black ops 2

161
00:10:05,530 --> 00:10:10,000
they are using the verbs for security

162
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:12,300
for the vault developers and operators

163
00:10:12,300 --> 00:10:16,870
with the security issues are handled in

164
00:10:16,870 --> 00:10:22,000
a different software what you can do is

165
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:25,930
to open issues in your guitar Burbage

166
00:10:25,930 --> 00:10:30,510
help for security security

167
00:10:30,510 --> 00:10:34,690
vulnerabilities as well this is a great

168
00:10:34,690 --> 00:10:40,330
concept called shift to left Joan weed

169
00:10:40,330 --> 00:10:44,170
is a long time ago not so long talk that

170
00:10:44,170 --> 00:10:48,580
when you viewed music here so the

171
00:10:48,580 --> 00:10:51,750
developers have to be comfortable and

172
00:10:51,750 --> 00:10:55,600
terminate the security of their own code

173
00:10:55,600 --> 00:10:58,990
well how can you do that you introduce

174
00:10:58,990 --> 00:11:01,240
security scans into the developers of

175
00:11:01,240 --> 00:11:02,480
flow

176
00:11:02,480 --> 00:11:06,079
so that pipeline enabled them to find

177
00:11:06,079 --> 00:11:10,699
and fix this one other builds before the

178
00:11:10,699 --> 00:11:15,680
code lived their hands ensure constant

179
00:11:15,680 --> 00:11:21,290
feedback the concept of shift laughs is

180
00:11:21,290 --> 00:11:24,589
the most important one of desktop

181
00:11:24,589 --> 00:11:27,199
because this is the contest that we will

182
00:11:27,199 --> 00:11:32,630
remove that will stop InfoSec pros from

183
00:11:32,630 --> 00:11:34,339
being thing as the bottleneck of

184
00:11:34,339 --> 00:11:38,980
innovation how does this work in theory

185
00:11:38,980 --> 00:11:45,470
when when you have a pipeline and all

186
00:11:45,470 --> 00:11:50,870
the steps are successful the direction

187
00:11:50,870 --> 00:11:55,360
of the pipeline is to the right right

188
00:11:55,360 --> 00:12:01,430
and but when something fails you do what

189
00:12:01,430 --> 00:12:05,420
he called shifts left you stop there the

190
00:12:05,420 --> 00:12:10,300
build and you create an issue into your

191
00:12:10,300 --> 00:12:14,360
repository your issue management such as

192
00:12:14,360 --> 00:12:19,519
HR with hope or github and you create

193
00:12:19,519 --> 00:12:24,800
something unless you to your developers

194
00:12:24,800 --> 00:12:28,720
so this is the concept of shift left you

195
00:12:28,720 --> 00:12:32,870
returned the codes to the one that built

196
00:12:32,870 --> 00:12:37,329
it so as John Willis a you constructed

197
00:12:37,329 --> 00:12:41,269
you security yeah you build your

198
00:12:41,269 --> 00:12:45,339
security right and this is great because

199
00:12:45,339 --> 00:12:48,649
different layers of security are created

200
00:12:48,649 --> 00:12:53,420
and removing reducing the costs of

201
00:12:53,420 --> 00:12:56,449
innovation and a slave accelerating the

202
00:12:56,449 --> 00:13:01,810
process of chains because you create our

203
00:13:01,810 --> 00:13:04,610
differentiation between security code

204
00:13:04,610 --> 00:13:08,569
and the new product one okay you have a

205
00:13:08,569 --> 00:13:13,100
hundred lines of coding and just ten

206
00:13:13,100 --> 00:13:16,069
percent of it wasn't approved okay you

207
00:13:16,069 --> 00:13:16,769
have

208
00:13:16,769 --> 00:13:20,759
percent of the chains into your Butte

209
00:13:20,759 --> 00:13:24,179
the 10% can wait for tomorrow

210
00:13:24,179 --> 00:13:29,329
so until we reduce the costs of your

211
00:13:29,329 --> 00:13:35,839
development okay so here he'd see

212
00:13:35,839 --> 00:13:40,350
standard that's a cop's pipeline with

213
00:13:40,350 --> 00:13:43,829
most of their more used well this is a

214
00:13:43,829 --> 00:13:48,809
this can be updated when he is he the

215
00:13:48,809 --> 00:13:52,499
name of some of the software that are

216
00:13:52,499 --> 00:13:57,149
moving most use right now with into

217
00:13:57,149 --> 00:14:03,480
deaths a cops and before I go forward

218
00:14:03,480 --> 00:14:06,989
let me talk about something that most of

219
00:14:06,989 --> 00:14:09,239
people don't keep in mind but it's very

220
00:14:09,239 --> 00:14:13,889
interest when you are InfoSec Pro in

221
00:14:13,889 --> 00:14:18,989
working with the verbs Qin try to use

222
00:14:18,989 --> 00:14:22,920
your post Morton skills because here

223
00:14:22,920 --> 00:14:30,209
used to to disasters right sadly so one

224
00:14:30,209 --> 00:14:35,040
of the cuter one of the fields into the

225
00:14:35,040 --> 00:14:37,230
develop scooter is to work with post

226
00:14:37,230 --> 00:14:44,389
motor in a more agile and faster way but

227
00:14:44,389 --> 00:14:47,399
InfoSec pros are really good into post

228
00:14:47,399 --> 00:14:49,410
Morton and this is something that you

229
00:14:49,410 --> 00:14:54,420
can use to convert to feel as part of

230
00:14:54,420 --> 00:14:59,699
the job okay now enough about theory now

231
00:14:59,699 --> 00:15:01,649
you're going to talk about action and

232
00:15:01,649 --> 00:15:05,189
this is where I really like this is

233
00:15:05,189 --> 00:15:08,100
really like because as you see my

234
00:15:08,100 --> 00:15:09,419
English is not so good

235
00:15:09,419 --> 00:15:11,989
talk about actions is something that I

236
00:15:11,989 --> 00:15:15,709
that goes is what I hope

237
00:15:15,709 --> 00:15:19,230
okay how to secure the cops Matt dollars

238
00:15:19,230 --> 00:15:24,540
and technologies first let's take a step

239
00:15:24,540 --> 00:15:27,990
back and remember that what we met

240
00:15:27,990 --> 00:15:31,549
DevOps methodologies and

241
00:15:31,549 --> 00:15:35,959
they're giant lavas moment they brought

242
00:15:35,959 --> 00:15:40,229
into the markets a whole new mix of

243
00:15:40,229 --> 00:15:45,079
concepts such as Microsoft's apic ICG

244
00:15:45,079 --> 00:15:50,689
containers clusters private public and

245
00:15:50,689 --> 00:15:55,109
multi-cloud of course nodebots cuter

246
00:15:55,109 --> 00:15:58,709
notify the web's environment is equal to

247
00:15:58,709 --> 00:16:00,899
another with different cultures and of

248
00:16:00,899 --> 00:16:02,970
course different tooling as well

249
00:16:02,970 --> 00:16:05,009
especially considering the amount of

250
00:16:05,009 --> 00:16:09,389
options available if he includes only

251
00:16:09,389 --> 00:16:12,509
the cognitive foundations options here

252
00:16:12,509 --> 00:16:17,759
you have more than a thousand and three

253
00:16:17,759 --> 00:16:21,029
hundred products it's virtually

254
00:16:21,029 --> 00:16:23,279
impossible to be a desiccant engineer

255
00:16:23,279 --> 00:16:27,139
and and say that you are able to secure

256
00:16:27,139 --> 00:16:34,529
hot projects right to illustrate what I

257
00:16:34,529 --> 00:16:37,229
am talking about everyone almost

258
00:16:37,229 --> 00:16:38,970
everyone knows this figure is very

259
00:16:38,970 --> 00:16:41,309
popular on the Internet when you are

260
00:16:41,309 --> 00:16:44,879
when you search for that site DevOps

261
00:16:44,879 --> 00:16:49,619
tools this is the the image that Google

262
00:16:49,619 --> 00:16:53,159
shows and if you expand your search a

263
00:16:53,159 --> 00:16:56,339
little bit more you you see this options

264
00:16:56,339 --> 00:17:00,539
and the cognitive foundations list that

265
00:17:00,539 --> 00:17:05,669
I was talking about so to make our

266
00:17:05,669 --> 00:17:07,679
journeys simpler as a problems in the

267
00:17:07,679 --> 00:17:10,259
beginning of this talk let's concentrate

268
00:17:10,259 --> 00:17:15,109
ourselves into their cognitive security

269
00:17:15,109 --> 00:17:19,159
forces code container cluster and proud

270
00:17:19,159 --> 00:17:22,949
this is another nice take away from my

271
00:17:22,949 --> 00:17:30,440
talk I hope ok let's start by code but

272
00:17:30,440 --> 00:17:33,269
before you go

273
00:17:33,269 --> 00:17:35,840
but before sort of talking about code

274
00:17:35,840 --> 00:17:38,840
let's

275
00:17:39,990 --> 00:17:43,230
you can see in the figure each one of

276
00:17:43,230 --> 00:17:45,929
the seas depend on this huge of the

277
00:17:45,929 --> 00:17:50,910
squares in which in which they fit so

278
00:17:50,910 --> 00:17:54,480
for example your code is a secured as a

279
00:17:54,480 --> 00:17:57,450
container and your container and your

280
00:17:57,450 --> 00:18:00,150
codes is security as your cluster and

281
00:18:00,150 --> 00:18:02,970
you code hotel and enclosures ease and

282
00:18:02,970 --> 00:18:05,910
security as your cloud be it private

283
00:18:05,910 --> 00:18:13,020
public or mochi cloud so remember if you

284
00:18:13,020 --> 00:18:17,700
just have a code security strategy you

285
00:18:17,700 --> 00:18:21,929
are not secured because you have more

286
00:18:21,929 --> 00:18:29,250
three C's to all to concern yourself ok

287
00:18:29,250 --> 00:18:36,210
let's start with code I'm def expect

288
00:18:36,210 --> 00:18:41,300
line oops that box behind is generally

289
00:18:41,300 --> 00:18:44,940
divided into phases and it's impossible

290
00:18:44,940 --> 00:18:47,040
it's possible to start to bring more

291
00:18:47,040 --> 00:18:50,580
security into the pipeline methodology

292
00:18:50,580 --> 00:18:55,290
by automating security code scanners in

293
00:18:55,290 --> 00:18:58,400
the previewed phase you can have a

294
00:18:58,400 --> 00:19:04,620
static analysis test it's a test that he

295
00:19:04,620 --> 00:19:06,860
performing and non production

296
00:19:06,860 --> 00:19:09,929
environment such as a pipeline for

297
00:19:09,929 --> 00:19:14,460
example and the sassed inspects the

298
00:19:14,460 --> 00:19:17,270
application for coding failures

299
00:19:17,270 --> 00:19:21,900
backdoors and hours some of the tools

300
00:19:21,900 --> 00:19:24,450
and languages is specific such as the

301
00:19:24,450 --> 00:19:30,090
goal and linked but so near cube of the

302
00:19:30,090 --> 00:19:32,970
four ones are open source tools terminal

303
00:19:32,970 --> 00:19:35,760
cube is able to check more than 20

304
00:19:35,760 --> 00:19:38,580
languages so when you are searching for

305
00:19:38,580 --> 00:19:43,470
sassed you have to search for one that

306
00:19:43,470 --> 00:19:48,030
checks your code will be your Python or

307
00:19:48,030 --> 00:19:49,340
whatever you are

308
00:19:49,340 --> 00:19:55,490
coding these days and be shocked if the

309
00:19:55,490 --> 00:19:58,640
language that you are using its cover

310
00:19:58,640 --> 00:20:03,050
back down by the tools as a section

311
00:20:03,050 --> 00:20:07,910
right it is a builder options in the

312
00:20:07,910 --> 00:20:12,950
preview stage you can also have can you

313
00:20:12,950 --> 00:20:15,740
can also scan the dependencies it's a

314
00:20:15,740 --> 00:20:19,010
matter of inventory dependence of

315
00:20:19,010 --> 00:20:23,270
binaries and executables and ensure that

316
00:20:23,270 --> 00:20:28,100
this dependences are okay over which you

317
00:20:28,100 --> 00:20:31,130
have no control it's more it's more

318
00:20:31,130 --> 00:20:35,050
common nowadays to have open source code

319
00:20:35,050 --> 00:20:39,410
introducing to your into your own code

320
00:20:39,410 --> 00:20:43,670
so you have to check the divine movies

321
00:20:43,670 --> 00:20:45,740
and the libraries and all the dependents

322
00:20:45,740 --> 00:20:48,920
that you are using checking for

323
00:20:48,920 --> 00:20:52,550
malicious code a market standard of

324
00:20:52,550 --> 00:20:55,400
course is the possible defenses Shack

325
00:20:55,400 --> 00:20:59,840
but you have more options out there is

326
00:20:59,840 --> 00:21:02,980
nique it's a great company and I am

327
00:21:02,980 --> 00:21:05,660
feeling that they're going open source

328
00:21:05,660 --> 00:21:09,160
but I am Not sure and I cannot confirm

329
00:21:09,160 --> 00:21:16,360
and after the deploy you can have

330
00:21:16,660 --> 00:21:19,940
dynamic application security test at

331
00:21:19,940 --> 00:21:23,650
best different from the static test

332
00:21:23,650 --> 00:21:26,690
consists of test performance during this

333
00:21:26,690 --> 00:21:30,650
equation monetary things such as system

334
00:21:30,650 --> 00:21:34,100
memory functional behavior response time

335
00:21:34,100 --> 00:21:39,800
and system performance overall this test

336
00:21:39,800 --> 00:21:44,210
is similar to analysis that an attacker

337
00:21:44,210 --> 00:21:47,810
would do to try to gain improper access

338
00:21:47,810 --> 00:21:51,890
to your application and a good example

339
00:21:51,890 --> 00:21:57,050
are the disaster and Mickey to a be

340
00:21:57,050 --> 00:22:01,360
vulnerable to scanner and of course the

341
00:22:01,360 --> 00:22:05,539
ethics plight as well there are many

342
00:22:05,539 --> 00:22:08,539
more modern tools that you can use in

343
00:22:08,539 --> 00:22:12,309
your pipeline such as last interactive

344
00:22:12,309 --> 00:22:15,039
application security tests and Rask

345
00:22:15,039 --> 00:22:17,770
real-time applications in huge

346
00:22:17,770 --> 00:22:21,710
protection kind of next generation web

347
00:22:21,710 --> 00:22:25,340
application file but big steps right

348
00:22:25,340 --> 00:22:30,470
this is the start of your depth AQAP's

349
00:22:30,470 --> 00:22:35,659
joining so try to include sass and

350
00:22:35,659 --> 00:22:38,600
action to your pipeline and in no time

351
00:22:38,600 --> 00:22:40,880
we use looking for you'll be looking for

352
00:22:40,880 --> 00:22:50,860
other tooling okay what else okay I like

353
00:22:50,860 --> 00:22:56,380
to you to treat as code but it's not

354
00:22:56,380 --> 00:23:00,049
it's your CI CG plataform such as me

355
00:23:00,049 --> 00:23:06,250
drop each hold leisure in etc from many

356
00:23:06,250 --> 00:23:09,350
organizations they are the cornerstones

357
00:23:09,350 --> 00:23:13,730
of their DevOps strategy and securing

358
00:23:13,730 --> 00:23:18,049
these tools is as essential as securing

359
00:23:18,049 --> 00:23:23,020
the code that is host that is hosting it

360
00:23:23,020 --> 00:23:25,880
it's also a great starting point to

361
00:23:25,880 --> 00:23:29,690
adopt the secure the secure strategy of

362
00:23:29,690 --> 00:23:32,779
ownership shared ownership with

363
00:23:32,779 --> 00:23:36,200
developers as they are the primary use

364
00:23:36,200 --> 00:23:41,029
of these platforms together you can

365
00:23:41,029 --> 00:23:45,500
create the story of the plataform users

366
00:23:45,500 --> 00:23:48,230
and map how the different ways that they

367
00:23:48,230 --> 00:23:52,730
could abuse the tool and plan actions to

368
00:23:52,730 --> 00:23:56,809
minimize minimize these risks then you

369
00:23:56,809 --> 00:23:59,950
can include these actions into the

370
00:23:59,950 --> 00:24:03,440
roadmap creating issues and this is a

371
00:24:03,440 --> 00:24:07,390
good starting point both to the

372
00:24:07,390 --> 00:24:13,430
developers of the InfoSec pros as web

373
00:24:13,430 --> 00:24:17,720
and remember that even if your plataform

374
00:24:17,720 --> 00:24:21,890
your repositories is a sass the provider

375
00:24:21,890 --> 00:24:24,260
is only responsible for the security of

376
00:24:24,260 --> 00:24:27,290
the environment the configuration of

377
00:24:27,290 --> 00:24:32,420
your instance is - up to you but get lab

378
00:24:32,420 --> 00:24:36,800
and github they have security center

379
00:24:36,800 --> 00:24:39,260
with the tale documentation be sure to

380
00:24:39,260 --> 00:24:44,470
check them ok back to the first C's code

381
00:24:44,470 --> 00:24:47,720
as part of the code your CIS eg

382
00:24:47,720 --> 00:24:53,710
plataform what's nice container okay

383
00:24:53,710 --> 00:24:56,660
the develops the hobbs environment and

384
00:24:56,660 --> 00:25:00,830
the concept of containerization are such

385
00:25:00,830 --> 00:25:02,960
important steps to improve the facings

386
00:25:02,960 --> 00:25:06,070
efficients of application deliver and

387
00:25:06,070 --> 00:25:12,680
deployment containers are powerful are

388
00:25:12,680 --> 00:25:15,800
powerful security tools if while we use

389
00:25:15,800 --> 00:25:18,620
as they are not the creation of image

390
00:25:18,620 --> 00:25:23,210
standards to be use although many images

391
00:25:23,210 --> 00:25:26,180
are available out there it has become a

392
00:25:26,180 --> 00:25:28,820
city security cliche to ask for

393
00:25:28,820 --> 00:25:33,440
moderation in its use jelly ideally your

394
00:25:33,440 --> 00:25:36,950
team should create their own images from

395
00:25:36,950 --> 00:25:47,600
following safety recommendations ok you

396
00:25:47,600 --> 00:25:51,470
can have a series of steps to follow I

397
00:25:51,470 --> 00:25:54,200
will not go into details right now

398
00:25:54,200 --> 00:25:56,600
because I'd like to recommend you to

399
00:25:56,600 --> 00:26:01,610
check the docker bench for security it's

400
00:26:01,610 --> 00:26:03,830
a document created by the Center for

401
00:26:03,830 --> 00:26:08,990
Internet Security seize and it's a

402
00:26:08,990 --> 00:26:11,060
reference document designed to establish

403
00:26:11,060 --> 00:26:18,159
a baseline for how to secure your docker

404
00:26:18,520 --> 00:26:21,740
recently is NIC has an on-site Spanish

405
00:26:21,740 --> 00:26:24,440
partnership with docker allowing users

406
00:26:24,440 --> 00:26:26,410
to track their imaging and

407
00:26:26,410 --> 00:26:30,610
it will be a great option as well but

408
00:26:30,610 --> 00:26:34,680
back to the Center for Internet Security

409
00:26:34,680 --> 00:26:38,230
document you can use the darker bench

410
00:26:38,230 --> 00:26:41,950
for security script to Shaklee if you

411
00:26:41,950 --> 00:26:44,800
you're in docker image is falling out

412
00:26:44,800 --> 00:26:46,720
the guidelines accent the documents

413
00:26:46,720 --> 00:26:52,000
another options is declare is clear the

414
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:54,790
open source project for static analysis

415
00:26:54,790 --> 00:26:58,450
of vulnerabilities and docker containers

416
00:26:58,450 --> 00:27:05,290
so a very fast revision you have the

417
00:27:05,290 --> 00:27:12,250
docket the Tokyo Center for Internet

418
00:27:12,250 --> 00:27:13,120
Security

419
00:27:13,120 --> 00:27:15,640
document and you have the doctor bench

420
00:27:15,640 --> 00:27:18,280
for security script and if you want

421
00:27:18,280 --> 00:27:20,740
another open source tool you have clear

422
00:27:20,740 --> 00:27:22,810
of course there is a large number of

423
00:27:22,810 --> 00:27:27,250
options this is the more simple for you

424
00:27:27,250 --> 00:27:32,970
to start okay

425
00:27:32,970 --> 00:27:37,540
cluster many cabinets your district

426
00:27:37,540 --> 00:27:40,450
cabinet will be as safe as the cloud

427
00:27:40,450 --> 00:27:44,950
where which ones now so as the container

428
00:27:44,950 --> 00:27:49,620
and the code including Collins Cuban

429
00:27:49,620 --> 00:27:58,409
execution it's important such a P I and

430
00:28:06,120 --> 00:28:10,690
controlling for another other computer

431
00:28:10,690 --> 00:28:14,140
switches workloads or user runtimes and

432
00:28:14,140 --> 00:28:19,140
such as memory used to prevent attack

433
00:28:19,890 --> 00:28:22,870
the Center for International Security so

434
00:28:22,870 --> 00:28:27,900
has a document about Cuba net secured

435
00:28:27,900 --> 00:28:30,790
like likewise is a document designed

436
00:28:30,790 --> 00:28:32,200
establish a secure configuration

437
00:28:32,200 --> 00:28:36,610
baseline for Cuba nights and you can

438
00:28:36,610 --> 00:28:39,070
check the documents of course and if you

439
00:28:39,070 --> 00:28:40,210
want to

440
00:28:40,210 --> 00:28:45,100
to test cabinets security against this

441
00:28:45,100 --> 00:28:48,340
require the list you can use Cooper

442
00:28:48,340 --> 00:28:52,060
bench to automate discussing your

443
00:28:52,060 --> 00:28:58,150
insides your pipeline and you can use

444
00:28:58,150 --> 00:29:02,050
also cube Hunter commander it's a kind

445
00:29:02,050 --> 00:29:04,900
of penetration test both are developed

446
00:29:04,900 --> 00:29:09,190
by aqua and aqua has a large amount of

447
00:29:09,190 --> 00:29:13,390
documentation that it's they are I

448
00:29:13,390 --> 00:29:16,150
really recommend our course website this

449
00:29:16,150 --> 00:29:19,270
is not propaganda but I learn a lot with

450
00:29:19,270 --> 00:29:25,210
them so okay for cabinets be sure to

451
00:29:25,210 --> 00:29:28,900
check the documentation and about how to

452
00:29:28,900 --> 00:29:32,200
secure and how to treat restrict up his

453
00:29:32,200 --> 00:29:37,840
trip taxes to your cluster and also try

454
00:29:37,840 --> 00:29:40,330
to use good invention hunter of course

455
00:29:40,330 --> 00:29:42,580
there is a large amount of tools out

456
00:29:42,580 --> 00:29:46,150
there but if you want to start a high

457
00:29:46,150 --> 00:29:53,110
leg event convention hunter and finally

458
00:29:53,110 --> 00:29:59,879
we have the left see cloud

459
00:30:01,950 --> 00:30:06,390
the main message about cloud is that you

460
00:30:06,390 --> 00:30:08,710
also do a concept of shared

461
00:30:08,710 --> 00:30:12,220
responsibility this is something that I

462
00:30:12,220 --> 00:30:16,180
took from Amazon website and I'm sure

463
00:30:16,180 --> 00:30:18,540
Google has something similar because

464
00:30:18,540 --> 00:30:22,170
they give the pulse are almost the same

465
00:30:22,170 --> 00:30:25,060
the Securities the cloud is similar to

466
00:30:25,060 --> 00:30:30,330
secure in your own private data centers

467
00:30:30,450 --> 00:30:33,430
only without the cost of maintaining

468
00:30:33,430 --> 00:30:37,240
facilities and hardware in the cloud you

469
00:30:37,240 --> 00:30:39,610
don't have to manage physical services

470
00:30:39,610 --> 00:30:42,670
or establish devices instead you use

471
00:30:42,670 --> 00:30:44,860
social base security tools to monitor

472
00:30:44,860 --> 00:30:47,700
and protector the flow of information to

473
00:30:47,700 --> 00:30:53,170
and out of your cloud resource for this

474
00:30:53,170 --> 00:30:54,190
reason classic

475
00:30:54,190 --> 00:30:56,500
which is a shared responsibility between

476
00:30:56,500 --> 00:31:01,029
the customer and AWS we're customers our

477
00:31:01,029 --> 00:31:03,700
customers are responsible for security

478
00:31:03,700 --> 00:31:08,169
in the cloud and AWS is responsible for

479
00:31:08,169 --> 00:31:11,620
security of the cloud so is the same for

480
00:31:11,620 --> 00:31:15,399
your gates elaborate Holden instance you

481
00:31:15,399 --> 00:31:18,129
worst you are responsible to configure

482
00:31:18,129 --> 00:31:21,090
the restrictions and all the secured

483
00:31:21,090 --> 00:31:26,039
that needs to make your data secure and

484
00:31:26,039 --> 00:31:29,679
of course be sure to check the security

485
00:31:29,679 --> 00:31:35,019
center of your cloud provider AWS cloud

486
00:31:35,019 --> 00:31:39,210
security has a large amount of

487
00:31:39,210 --> 00:31:42,480
documentation and many free trainings

488
00:31:42,480 --> 00:31:46,450
the same goes to Google Cloud and Asia

489
00:31:46,450 --> 00:31:50,320
and if you want to use open source tools

490
00:31:50,320 --> 00:31:54,340
to secure your environment you have

491
00:31:54,340 --> 00:31:59,649
again a cause close exploit and else

492
00:31:59,649 --> 00:32:03,460
called exploit is available you can use

493
00:32:03,460 --> 00:32:09,750
it to check both both Asia

494
00:32:09,750 --> 00:32:14,309
AWS and of course Google itself and

495
00:32:14,309 --> 00:32:17,169
different in a different way for side

496
00:32:17,169 --> 00:32:23,710
Security's specific for G Juicy J just

497
00:32:23,710 --> 00:32:28,690
Google Cloud for Google Cloud and one of

498
00:32:28,690 --> 00:32:31,120
the tools that I really like is the

499
00:32:31,120 --> 00:32:35,259
security monkey Netflix technology chin

500
00:32:35,259 --> 00:32:37,720
is famous for the series of tools that

501
00:32:37,720 --> 00:32:41,950
make opening available such as the they

502
00:32:41,950 --> 00:32:45,190
were secured date cows monkey and they

503
00:32:45,190 --> 00:32:47,370
have nowadays security monkey as well

504
00:32:47,370 --> 00:32:53,799
and you have is come to okay

505
00:32:53,799 --> 00:32:58,840
conclusion this was not the one of the

506
00:32:58,840 --> 00:33:01,419
best of my talks and I really apologize

507
00:33:01,419 --> 00:33:04,049
guys

508
00:33:05,200 --> 00:33:08,590
okay so now we have the basics to dig

509
00:33:08,590 --> 00:33:10,480
into more details about this new

510
00:33:10,480 --> 00:33:14,230
fascinating field I know it was a large

511
00:33:14,230 --> 00:33:17,919
process and it's a lot to learn but here

512
00:33:17,919 --> 00:33:20,799
it is a little to-do list of your next

513
00:33:20,799 --> 00:33:26,010
steps into your dev psych ops journey

514
00:33:26,220 --> 00:33:29,350
first let's revise what is DEP SEC ops

515
00:33:29,350 --> 00:33:33,580
falling guy concept of deaths I got

516
00:33:33,580 --> 00:33:36,429
three phases that suck-ups is to

517
00:33:36,429 --> 00:33:38,980
introduce secure chain to develop secure

518
00:33:38,980 --> 00:33:42,130
to secure the Maps methodologies and of

519
00:33:42,130 --> 00:33:45,190
course to secure develops technologies

520
00:33:45,190 --> 00:33:51,159
as well if you are ops or SEC

521
00:33:51,159 --> 00:33:53,380
professional try to get on board with

522
00:33:53,380 --> 00:33:56,350
the program learn how to code learn how

523
00:33:56,350 --> 00:33:59,679
to use git and see your code your

524
00:33:59,679 --> 00:34:03,309
configuration that's code this will be

525
00:34:03,309 --> 00:34:06,519
your site of securities code but

526
00:34:06,519 --> 00:34:10,449
remember now termination is just one of

527
00:34:10,449 --> 00:34:14,109
the part of dev cycles you have to

528
00:34:14,109 --> 00:34:18,869
change your mindset as well for dogs I

529
00:34:18,869 --> 00:34:21,668
highly recommend you to learn about

530
00:34:21,668 --> 00:34:25,089
secure development practices there is a

531
00:34:25,089 --> 00:34:27,699
large amount of documentation what is on

532
00:34:27,699 --> 00:34:31,089
the internet and your info SEC Pro is

533
00:34:31,089 --> 00:34:35,079
available to help you remember about the

534
00:34:35,079 --> 00:34:39,540
concept of shift left that is to include

535
00:34:39,540 --> 00:34:42,909
security checks into your pipeline to

536
00:34:42,909 --> 00:34:45,869
import empower your dev and ops

537
00:34:45,869 --> 00:34:49,260
professionals to check security measures

538
00:34:49,260 --> 00:34:57,400
and in other developed methodologies and

539
00:34:57,400 --> 00:34:59,819
tools that you have to care about

540
00:34:59,819 --> 00:35:02,800
concept concentrate yourselves or

541
00:35:02,800 --> 00:35:05,829
yourself into the four C's codes

542
00:35:05,829 --> 00:35:08,950
container closed and calm I haven't

543
00:35:08,950 --> 00:35:12,220
heard that well VI PG because I see it

544
00:35:12,220 --> 00:35:16,780
as a part of your code platform and this

545
00:35:16,780 --> 00:35:18,860
is a nice

546
00:35:18,860 --> 00:35:21,900
assessment for you to do is get lab

547
00:35:21,900 --> 00:35:27,180
steps I cops test to check how mature is

548
00:35:27,180 --> 00:35:31,200
your dad's a cop's strategy and it's

549
00:35:31,200 --> 00:35:36,690
also how good how can I say that I'm

550
00:35:36,690 --> 00:35:37,320
good

551
00:35:37,320 --> 00:35:43,920
step by step oh wow what to do be sure

552
00:35:43,920 --> 00:35:47,280
to review this depth that's a cop's plan

553
00:35:47,280 --> 00:35:51,170
constantly and if you keep an eye on my

554
00:35:51,170 --> 00:35:56,880
Twitter I will be sure to to share more

555
00:35:56,880 --> 00:35:59,700
there's a cop's resource to help you out

556
00:35:59,700 --> 00:36:03,420
I believe this very much concludes my

557
00:36:03,420 --> 00:36:05,580
talk and I hope you guys have enjoyed

558
00:36:05,580 --> 00:36:10,860
your time with me as much as I did thank

559
00:36:10,860 --> 00:36:13,650
you for sharing your time with me of

560
00:36:13,650 --> 00:36:17,340
course and perhaps we could start or key

561
00:36:17,340 --> 00:36:21,170
in a session right now

562
00:36:23,990 --> 00:36:26,250
awesome thank you very very much

563
00:36:26,250 --> 00:36:27,780

here so welcome welcome Michelle thank

565
00:36:30,450 --> 00:36:32,210
you very very much for your session

566
00:36:32,210 --> 00:36:35,700
we've got questions coming in in the in

567
00:36:35,700 --> 00:36:38,340
the in the chat was flying through now

568
00:36:38,340 --> 00:36:39,300
okay cool

569
00:36:39,300 --> 00:36:43,290
so we're late but we're gonna have five

570
00:36:43,290 --> 00:36:45,660
minutes for questions so Michelle thank

571
00:36:45,660 --> 00:36:47,130
you very much for your session really

572
00:36:47,130 --> 00:36:51,710
enjoyed it and and welcome to Def Con 24

573
00:36:51,710 --> 00:36:54,960
so first question from her Matt have you

574
00:36:54,960 --> 00:36:57,870
had resistant have you had resistance

575
00:36:57,870 --> 00:37:00,240
with DevOps people when talking of

576
00:37:00,240 --> 00:37:03,180
security with DevOps I always kind of

577
00:37:03,180 --> 00:37:06,360
you know wonder how different teams take

578
00:37:06,360 --> 00:37:10,310
the you know the this shared

579
00:37:10,310 --> 00:37:12,690
responsibility how well they want to

580
00:37:12,690 --> 00:37:15,240
take that from a dev point of view how

581
00:37:15,240 --> 00:37:18,630
have you found that well there is two

582
00:37:18,630 --> 00:37:21,720
main point to ten points of view to

583
00:37:21,720 --> 00:37:24,360
check this question before first you

584
00:37:24,360 --> 00:37:27,750
have to consider that security doesn't

585
00:37:27,750 --> 00:37:30,930
bring money to the business so for the

586
00:37:30,930 --> 00:37:34,680
vault for business decision-makers they

587
00:37:34,680 --> 00:37:37,020
don't take security of something crucial

588
00:37:37,020 --> 00:37:41,670
to the work but when secured fails you

589
00:37:41,670 --> 00:37:44,100
can lose a lot of money so this is

590
00:37:44,100 --> 00:37:46,080
something that secured InfoSec pros have

591
00:37:46,080 --> 00:37:48,570
to bring them word how much are you

592
00:37:48,570 --> 00:37:51,510
going to lose if something happens so

593
00:37:51,510 --> 00:37:54,090
this is the first thing that because

594
00:37:54,090 --> 00:37:56,640
most of the time developers are

595
00:37:56,640 --> 00:37:58,740
concerned about making chains bring more

596
00:37:58,740 --> 00:38:03,150
money bring more features to the

597
00:38:03,150 --> 00:38:06,120
sculpture and not taking care of secured

598
00:38:06,120 --> 00:38:11,910
so of course they have some some haunted

599
00:38:11,910 --> 00:38:15,570
haunted system some resistance to it

600
00:38:15,570 --> 00:38:18,810
because it's not part of the innovation

601
00:38:18,810 --> 00:38:22,770
that they are taking care so much so we

602
00:38:22,770 --> 00:38:25,640
have to make their job very smooth and

603
00:38:25,640 --> 00:38:28,140
bring them on board to this kind of

604
00:38:28,140 --> 00:38:33,110
concerns so this is why I talk about the

605
00:38:33,110 --> 00:38:37,080
repository as a first step into

606
00:38:37,080 --> 00:38:39,630
the share ownership because this is

607
00:38:39,630 --> 00:38:42,900
something fun to take care they didn't

608
00:38:42,900 --> 00:38:45,540
know how to use and they know how to use

609
00:38:45,540 --> 00:38:48,120
so this is something that you bring

610
00:38:48,120 --> 00:38:54,810
their own work and really interesting

611
00:38:54,810 --> 00:38:56,580
question coming in from Annie asking in

612
00:38:56,580 --> 00:38:58,410
your experience which of the four C's

613
00:38:58,410 --> 00:39:01,590
would you is generally more vulnerable

614
00:39:01,590 --> 00:39:05,520
so that if I jump back to the slide

615
00:39:05,520 --> 00:39:07,710
lucky because this is recorded I can see

616
00:39:07,710 --> 00:39:09,750
this turn back to this slide there so

617
00:39:09,750 --> 00:39:12,960
all of the four C's be a code C ICD plus

618
00:39:12,960 --> 00:39:15,870
and cloud how would you prioritize that

619
00:39:15,870 --> 00:39:17,670
in terms of which you know if you had

620
00:39:17,670 --> 00:39:19,980
limited time which would you climb like

621
00:39:19,980 --> 00:39:21,870
really prioritizes the areas that you

622
00:39:21,870 --> 00:39:25,200
need most need to focus on yeah this is

623
00:39:25,200 --> 00:39:27,720
something to be very careful because as

624
00:39:27,720 --> 00:39:31,440
you say on the slide each of the the C's

625
00:39:31,440 --> 00:39:34,710
is so secure as the other one so your

626
00:39:34,710 --> 00:39:37,140
code is so secure as your container and

627
00:39:37,140 --> 00:39:39,240
your container so secure as your cabinet

628
00:39:39,240 --> 00:39:42,180
but I think most the most important

629
00:39:42,180 --> 00:39:44,400
thing is caught because this is

630
00:39:44,400 --> 00:39:46,830
something that people doesn't take care

631
00:39:46,830 --> 00:39:50,130
they really doesn't bother because in

632
00:39:50,130 --> 00:39:53,130
the mind of most of the managers and

633
00:39:53,130 --> 00:39:57,630
developers okay you're going to know

634
00:39:57,630 --> 00:40:01,620
strategy and my code and all my

635
00:40:01,620 --> 00:40:03,420
infrastructure is on the cloud so I

636
00:40:03,420 --> 00:40:05,700
don't have to take care of bottles but

637
00:40:05,700 --> 00:40:09,390
this is the truth again

638
00:40:09,390 --> 00:40:11,840
the cloud is something that we have to

639
00:40:11,840 --> 00:40:14,970
have the mindset of shared

640
00:40:14,970 --> 00:40:17,840
responsibility so you have your

641
00:40:17,840 --> 00:40:20,580
responsibilities abundant route as so in

642
00:40:20,580 --> 00:40:26,370
my view would beat the crowd I'm a

643
00:40:26,370 --> 00:40:32,250
mature yeah I guess it's pretty much

644
00:40:32,250 --> 00:40:37,560
depends on on a lot of points it's

645
00:40:37,560 --> 00:40:39,600
difficult to say Oh be careful

646
00:40:39,600 --> 00:40:41,970
just about your cloud but be more

647
00:40:41,970 --> 00:40:48,240
careful about your cloud yeah and I

648
00:40:48,240 --> 00:40:50,580
guess also you know depending on the

649
00:40:50,580 --> 00:40:52,410
texts that you use if you're using maybe

650
00:40:52,410 --> 00:40:54,060
like a lambda function style

651
00:40:54,060 --> 00:40:55,680
architecture versus more of a monolith

652
00:40:55,680 --> 00:40:58,200
style architecture the responsibilities

653
00:40:58,200 --> 00:41:00,420
more heavily weighted towards you versus

654
00:41:00,420 --> 00:41:02,280
the the cloud vendor as well right so

655
00:41:02,280 --> 00:41:04,200
there's there's differences there as

656
00:41:04,200 --> 00:41:04,740
well

657
00:41:04,740 --> 00:41:06,900
one last question we can take from Seco

658
00:41:06,900 --> 00:41:12,180
floods can it be enough to use it so can

659
00:41:12,180 --> 00:41:14,100
it be enough to just use open source

660
00:41:14,100 --> 00:41:18,240
tools to secure C ICD even though that

661
00:41:18,240 --> 00:41:20,340
in case of a breach you'll probably lose

662
00:41:20,340 --> 00:41:27,210
money and reputation well if you're if

663
00:41:27,210 --> 00:41:32,540
you look at the supports terms of

664
00:41:32,540 --> 00:41:36,300
companies that are your pain they're

665
00:41:36,300 --> 00:41:39,360
they're commercial they they have a

666
00:41:39,360 --> 00:41:42,240
limited responsibility as well so of

667
00:41:42,240 --> 00:41:44,190
course you have support and if you are

668
00:41:44,190 --> 00:41:48,240
not if you don't feel comfortable enough

669
00:41:48,240 --> 00:41:51,660
to support your own infrastructure your

670
00:41:51,660 --> 00:41:56,730
own develop your own pipeline please go

671
00:41:56,730 --> 00:42:00,480
to a commercial one but if you are if

672
00:42:00,480 --> 00:42:03,870
you feel secure enough to take care of

673
00:42:03,870 --> 00:42:07,830
your own infrastructure I don't see that

674
00:42:07,830 --> 00:42:11,880
there is a lot of difference then stop

675
00:42:11,880 --> 00:42:14,490
talking about money because when

676
00:42:14,490 --> 00:42:19,230
something happens to your to your

677
00:42:19,230 --> 00:42:21,630
infrastructure there is an crowd for

678
00:42:21,630 --> 00:42:23,990
example there is a limited

679
00:42:23,990 --> 00:42:25,890
responsibilities that the company that

680
00:42:25,890 --> 00:42:29,250
supports you can shake so this is

681
00:42:29,250 --> 00:42:31,590
something for your business to chew to

682
00:42:31,590 --> 00:42:36,900
consider are you going to gain more or

683
00:42:36,900 --> 00:42:40,170
lose more of using open source I really

684
00:42:40,170 --> 00:42:42,510
like open source tools because of as the

685
00:42:42,510 --> 00:42:46,350
previous speaker said you are on the

686
00:42:46,350 --> 00:42:49,290
edge of every innovation because most of

687
00:42:49,290 --> 00:42:51,620
the companies they bring in open source

688
00:42:51,620 --> 00:42:55,200
solutions to the commercial ones so this

689
00:42:55,200 --> 00:42:56,880
is something that if you want to be on

690
00:42:56,880 --> 00:42:59,520
match about your open source but if you

691
00:42:59,520 --> 00:43:01,650
don't feel comfortable enough there is a

692
00:43:01,650 --> 00:43:03,780
lot of good companies come

693
00:43:03,780 --> 00:43:06,810
companies that can support you and of

694
00:43:06,810 --> 00:43:08,340
course there's also like a mix as well

695
00:43:08,340 --> 00:43:10,980
right so for example many vendors will

696
00:43:10,980 --> 00:43:11,580
have luck

697
00:43:11,580 --> 00:43:13,140
you mentioned snick for example many

698
00:43:13,140 --> 00:43:14,340
vendors Walt likes Nick will have a

699
00:43:14,340 --> 00:43:17,700
freemium offering well as like an

700
00:43:17,700 --> 00:43:20,490
enterprise offering so there's there's

701
00:43:20,490 --> 00:43:22,620
there's a balance there as well plus

702
00:43:22,620 --> 00:43:24,720
you're not always limited to just one

703
00:43:24,720 --> 00:43:26,880
tool so you can use a you know number if

704
00:43:26,880 --> 00:43:29,880
if you choose the different areas in the

705
00:43:29,880 --> 00:43:32,690
pipeline Michelle it's been a pleasure

706
00:43:32,690 --> 00:43:35,280
it's been really great Chapman yeah

707
00:43:35,280 --> 00:43:36,930
thank you very very much for your

708
00:43:36,930 --> 00:43:39,660
session appreciate you supporting dev

709
