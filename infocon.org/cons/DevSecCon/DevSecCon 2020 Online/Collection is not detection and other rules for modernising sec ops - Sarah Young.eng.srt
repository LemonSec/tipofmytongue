1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:02,159
all right everybody welcome back we're

2
00:00:02,159 --> 00:00:05,160
gonna get our next speaker up here for

3
00:00:05,160 --> 00:00:07,890
you sir Jung is our next speaker she's

4
00:00:07,890 --> 00:00:10,440
an azure security architect she's based

5
00:00:10,440 --> 00:00:12,090
in Melbourne but travels all over

6
00:00:12,090 --> 00:00:14,969
speaking at conferences and helping her

7
00:00:14,969 --> 00:00:16,320
customers secure their cloud

8
00:00:16,320 --> 00:00:18,990
environments and so forth so we're gonna

9
00:00:18,990 --> 00:00:21,210
bring Sara in here and let her get

10
00:00:21,210 --> 00:00:24,449
started with her presentation Sara with

11
00:00:24,449 --> 00:00:27,019
that it is all yours

12
00:00:27,019 --> 00:00:30,269
thank you hello everyone

13
00:00:30,269 --> 00:00:33,390
yep I hope you're having a good day or

14
00:00:33,390 --> 00:00:35,340
evening no matter where you are in the

15
00:00:35,340 --> 00:00:38,030
world thank you for joining me today

16
00:00:38,030 --> 00:00:41,750
so today I'm going to talk to you about

17
00:00:41,750 --> 00:00:44,129
security operations in a cloud native

18
00:00:44,129 --> 00:00:46,649
environment and yet the tagline is

19
00:00:46,649 --> 00:00:49,559
collection is not detection because it's

20
00:00:49,559 --> 00:00:52,020
a fun little it's rhymes and I have a

21
00:00:52,020 --> 00:00:53,489
sticker of it which I'll show you later

22
00:00:53,489 --> 00:00:56,789
and it's very cute but just real quick

23
00:00:56,789 --> 00:00:58,739
obviously just been introduced but Who

24
00:00:58,739 --> 00:01:01,350
am I I'm an azure security architect I

25
00:01:01,350 --> 00:01:03,149
live in Melbourne which is the colder

26
00:01:03,149 --> 00:01:05,519
and wetter bit of Australia but I'm

27
00:01:05,519 --> 00:01:07,640
actually currently in New Zealand so

28
00:01:07,640 --> 00:01:10,380
yeah thanks kovat and border closures

29
00:01:10,380 --> 00:01:13,229
for that one at some point I believe

30
00:01:13,229 --> 00:01:14,909
I'll get to go back to Australia I

31
00:01:14,909 --> 00:01:17,610
really love dogs that dog on the picture

32
00:01:17,610 --> 00:01:20,640
there is not me it is not mine it is my

33
00:01:20,640 --> 00:01:23,610
parents I live vicariously through her

34
00:01:23,610 --> 00:01:25,500
one day when I don't travel I'll

35
00:01:25,500 --> 00:01:28,890
definitely get one in a prior life it

36
00:01:28,890 --> 00:01:30,600
used to be a network and VoIP engineer

37
00:01:30,600 --> 00:01:32,909
and now I do all kinds of cloud security

38
00:01:32,909 --> 00:01:35,640
stuff including of course security

39
00:01:35,640 --> 00:01:39,150
operations I'm a prolific user of gifts

40
00:01:39,150 --> 00:01:42,210
on Chiefs we're not even going there

41
00:01:42,210 --> 00:01:44,270
during this we're not going that

42
00:01:44,270 --> 00:01:46,470
whatever you want to call them is fine

43
00:01:46,470 --> 00:01:50,369
by me and memes in my presentations if

44
00:01:50,369 --> 00:01:51,780
they're a little bit obscure I'll

45
00:01:51,780 --> 00:01:53,729
probably explain them it depends if you

46
00:01:53,729 --> 00:01:55,380
have my sense of humor but if you've

47
00:01:55,380 --> 00:01:57,180
ever seen one of my presentations before

48
00:01:57,180 --> 00:02:01,500
you probably already know that but what

49
00:02:01,500 --> 00:02:04,110
am I actually talking about today I want

50
00:02:04,110 --> 00:02:05,460
to talk about security operations

51
00:02:05,460 --> 00:02:08,190
because we talk about dev sack ops and

52
00:02:08,190 --> 00:02:09,568
we talk about and

53
00:02:09,568 --> 00:02:11,159
lots of people talk about putting

54
00:02:11,159 --> 00:02:12,959
security into development which of

55
00:02:12,959 --> 00:02:15,030
course is really important and I hid

56
00:02:15,030 --> 00:02:17,489
myself have talked on that subject many

57
00:02:17,489 --> 00:02:20,969
times before but we need to look we

58
00:02:20,969 --> 00:02:22,920
don't we sometimes forget that we also

59
00:02:22,920 --> 00:02:25,889
aren't going to get rid of what would

60
00:02:25,889 --> 00:02:28,650
more traditional traditional security

61
00:02:28,650 --> 00:02:31,409
operations so I'm gonna look at why

62
00:02:31,409 --> 00:02:33,510
those types of security operations are

63
00:02:33,510 --> 00:02:36,540
important and give you a recap of just

64
00:02:36,540 --> 00:02:38,340
how we looked at that stuff on premise

65
00:02:38,340 --> 00:02:39,840
or kind of in our traditional

66
00:02:39,840 --> 00:02:40,590
environment

67
00:02:40,590 --> 00:02:45,150
what who how when how do we actually do

68
00:02:45,150 --> 00:02:48,090
this and then I'm gonna talk lastly

69
00:02:48,090 --> 00:02:51,540
about the use cases we really need to

70
00:02:51,540 --> 00:02:53,669
talk about use cases let me tell you now

71
00:02:53,669 --> 00:02:55,409
on the right though if you're not

72
00:02:55,409 --> 00:02:57,359
familiar with that dog that dog it's

73
00:02:57,359 --> 00:02:57,959
called tofu

74
00:02:57,959 --> 00:03:00,180
he lives in Melbourne he's a really cute

75
00:03:00,180 --> 00:03:03,329
Shiba and he does feel good motivational

76
00:03:03,329 --> 00:03:05,639
videos if you need something to cheer

77
00:03:05,639 --> 00:03:07,650
you up I definitely recommend you go

78
00:03:07,650 --> 00:03:09,269
check him out on YouTube I'm not

79
00:03:09,269 --> 00:03:11,459
sponsored by him in any way shape or

80
00:03:11,459 --> 00:03:14,009
form I just think he's adorable and he

81
00:03:14,009 --> 00:03:15,329
recently did a video where he was

82
00:03:15,329 --> 00:03:17,370
hacking so I have to add it in to my

83
00:03:17,370 --> 00:03:23,669
talk so my sound might sound like a

84
00:03:23,669 --> 00:03:26,849
stupid question to anyone who works in

85
00:03:26,849 --> 00:03:29,519
security and any of you who are probably

86
00:03:29,519 --> 00:03:32,009
listening to to this presentation you

87
00:03:32,009 --> 00:03:33,930
probably at least have a vested interest

88
00:03:33,930 --> 00:03:35,729
or do security yourself

89
00:03:35,729 --> 00:03:38,099
so maybe saying why as security

90
00:03:38,099 --> 00:03:39,870
operations important seems like a stupid

91
00:03:39,870 --> 00:03:40,470
question

92
00:03:40,470 --> 00:03:43,470
but there's a reason I wanted to cover

93
00:03:43,470 --> 00:03:46,530
that at the beginning of this talk just

94
00:03:46,530 --> 00:03:48,569
before we go any further I think

95
00:03:48,569 --> 00:03:49,949
sometimes there's a lot of

96
00:03:49,949 --> 00:03:52,199
misinformation about what security

97
00:03:52,199 --> 00:03:54,870
operations does now you've probably seen

98
00:03:54,870 --> 00:03:57,090
many forms of this meme before I

99
00:03:57,090 --> 00:03:59,329
couldn't find a specific security

100
00:03:59,329 --> 00:04:02,340
operations one so I went for this

101
00:04:02,340 --> 00:04:05,939
general InfoSec one as you know what my

102
00:04:05,939 --> 00:04:08,489
parents think I do I'm a hacker what

103
00:04:08,489 --> 00:04:11,219
users think I do just great things what

104
00:04:11,219 --> 00:04:13,530
society thinks I do it's a guy with a

105
00:04:13,530 --> 00:04:17,310
balaclava of course what IT managers

106
00:04:17,310 --> 00:04:19,500
think I do just burn money and what I

107
00:04:19,500 --> 00:04:21,899
actually do is probably sit around and

108
00:04:21,899 --> 00:04:23,340
work with my colleagues

109
00:04:23,340 --> 00:04:25,530
at the current state in the current

110
00:04:25,530 --> 00:04:26,970
state of the world were doing that

111
00:04:26,970 --> 00:04:30,020
remotely not in person but I think the

112
00:04:30,020 --> 00:04:33,000
the important point here is that there

113
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:35,220
is I think a fundamental misconception

114
00:04:35,220 --> 00:04:37,710
about what security operations is for

115
00:04:37,710 --> 00:04:41,700
sometimes and and as I was saying at the

116
00:04:41,700 --> 00:04:43,380
beginning when we're moving into dev

117
00:04:43,380 --> 00:04:46,410
cycles and shifting right and using all

118
00:04:46,410 --> 00:04:48,840
those buzzwords we still do need that

119
00:04:48,840 --> 00:04:51,240
incident response and a security

120
00:04:51,240 --> 00:04:53,669
monitoring side of things albeit it

121
00:04:53,669 --> 00:04:56,090
might be done a little bit differently I

122
00:04:56,090 --> 00:04:59,520
do keep meaning to make a security

123
00:04:59,520 --> 00:05:02,130
operations one because I couldn't find

124
00:05:02,130 --> 00:05:04,280
one on Google if anyone finds one please

125
00:05:04,280 --> 00:05:07,700
tell me because I would love to see it

126
00:05:07,700 --> 00:05:10,889
but so here is some I mean I've just

127
00:05:10,889 --> 00:05:13,830
picked some random some some random

128
00:05:13,830 --> 00:05:15,510
articles here but most of this was

129
00:05:15,510 --> 00:05:17,580
containers and kubernetes

130
00:05:17,580 --> 00:05:20,220
stuff but why should you care because we

131
00:05:20,220 --> 00:05:22,139
know that there are breaches happening

132
00:05:22,139 --> 00:05:25,260
all the time you know we say no you

133
00:05:25,260 --> 00:05:27,830
should assume breach you shouldn't just

134
00:05:27,830 --> 00:05:30,210
you don't if you don't think you've been

135
00:05:30,210 --> 00:05:32,010
breached the chances are you have been

136
00:05:32,010 --> 00:05:33,600
breached but you just don't know about

137
00:05:33,600 --> 00:05:36,120
it so you know why should you care every

138
00:05:36,120 --> 00:05:37,620
organization no matter whether you're

139
00:05:37,620 --> 00:05:40,560
big or small or whatever you do you need

140
00:05:40,560 --> 00:05:42,300
to care about security operations

141
00:05:42,300 --> 00:05:45,180
because you will have been owned your

142
00:05:45,180 --> 00:05:46,950
users will have been owned in some way

143
00:05:46,950 --> 00:05:49,440
shape or form I mean I just picked these

144
00:05:49,440 --> 00:05:51,270
ones randomly off the internet when I

145
00:05:51,270 --> 00:05:53,370
was making the slide but you know I know

146
00:05:53,370 --> 00:05:55,260
that every single one of you will be

147
00:05:55,260 --> 00:05:57,000
able to think of a high-profile breach

148
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:58,950
this happened and of course at the

149
00:05:58,950 --> 00:06:01,410
moment in the current environment we're

150
00:06:01,410 --> 00:06:04,860
seeing more breaches things around

151
00:06:04,860 --> 00:06:07,470
always seeing people use tactics around

152
00:06:07,470 --> 00:06:10,590
covered and things like that so yeah so

153
00:06:10,590 --> 00:06:12,539
whenever we find a way to mitigate a

154
00:06:12,539 --> 00:06:14,729
certain type of attack attackers are

155
00:06:14,729 --> 00:06:16,740
developing and changing their methods or

156
00:06:16,740 --> 00:06:23,070
their they're altering them to to to

157
00:06:23,070 --> 00:06:24,840
adapt to what's going on in the world as

158
00:06:24,840 --> 00:06:27,720
I said there's a lot of covert related

159
00:06:27,720 --> 00:06:29,700
scams and threats going around at the

160
00:06:29,700 --> 00:06:32,760
moment I know personally and you can I'm

161
00:06:32,760 --> 00:06:35,190
not sure what you've experienced

162
00:06:35,190 --> 00:06:36,710
yourself I know personally I've had

163
00:06:36,710 --> 00:06:39,310
kovin related fishing type emails

164
00:06:39,310 --> 00:06:42,290
offering me PPE and hand sanitizer and

165
00:06:42,290 --> 00:06:44,750
things like that and I'm pretty sure

166
00:06:44,750 --> 00:06:46,730
they're not legitimate websites but

167
00:06:46,730 --> 00:06:48,980
again they use these things to play into

168
00:06:48,980 --> 00:06:51,110
people's fears so security operations

169
00:06:51,110 --> 00:06:53,570
are still really important and of course

170
00:06:53,570 --> 00:06:55,150
now with more people working from home

171
00:06:55,150 --> 00:06:58,340
when that security operations is

172
00:06:58,340 --> 00:07:01,070
becoming even more distributed as in you

173
00:07:01,070 --> 00:07:04,100
know we are an organized an organization

174
00:07:04,100 --> 00:07:06,200
security operations are starting to it's

175
00:07:06,200 --> 00:07:08,090
starting to leak to sort of work its way

176
00:07:08,090 --> 00:07:10,040
into people's homes as well when you

177
00:07:10,040 --> 00:07:11,800
used to be quite office focused so

178
00:07:11,800 --> 00:07:14,360
there's so many different things here

179
00:07:14,360 --> 00:07:16,490
and this shouldn't be anything new to

180
00:07:16,490 --> 00:07:19,760
you but I think sometimes we you know

181
00:07:19,760 --> 00:07:21,200
sometimes we need to refocus on it a

182
00:07:21,200 --> 00:07:24,320
little bit and I just this is from

183
00:07:24,320 --> 00:07:26,930
Microsoft security threat Intel it's

184
00:07:26,930 --> 00:07:30,020
just to give you an idea of what the

185
00:07:30,020 --> 00:07:32,120
kind of attack surface at the moment so

186
00:07:32,120 --> 00:07:35,900
this is these prices are in US dollars

187
00:07:35,900 --> 00:07:38,360
you can see and it just gives you an

188
00:07:38,360 --> 00:07:41,060
idea actually how inexpensive it is to

189
00:07:41,060 --> 00:07:43,130
attack people so you don't necessarily

190
00:07:43,130 --> 00:07:44,900
need to be a state-sponsored

191
00:07:44,900 --> 00:07:47,210
actor you don't have to be a huge large

192
00:07:47,210 --> 00:07:49,700
criminal syndicate you know it is

193
00:07:49,700 --> 00:07:51,800
relatively cheap to go on the dark web

194
00:07:51,800 --> 00:07:55,250
procure tools and run attacks so an

195
00:07:55,250 --> 00:07:56,840
exploit kit you know maybe about

196
00:07:56,840 --> 00:07:58,370
fourteen hundred dollars a month zero

197
00:07:58,370 --> 00:08:00,890
day is now a lot of people are worried

198
00:08:00,890 --> 00:08:02,690
about zero day isn't and rightly so

199
00:08:02,690 --> 00:08:05,750
because zero days have no mitigation or

200
00:08:05,750 --> 00:08:07,790
at least initially they don't have any

201
00:08:07,790 --> 00:08:09,650
mitigation but in fact the cost to

202
00:08:09,650 --> 00:08:11,420
develop one goes from about fifty

203
00:08:11,420 --> 00:08:13,520
thousand dollars up to three point five

204
00:08:13,520 --> 00:08:16,400
million so there's only particular types

205
00:08:16,400 --> 00:08:19,010
of attackers that can actually have the

206
00:08:19,010 --> 00:08:20,750
results and the money to develop those

207
00:08:20,750 --> 00:08:22,220
but if you look at things like

208
00:08:22,220 --> 00:08:25,310
ransomware um that only cost sixty six

209
00:08:25,310 --> 00:08:29,240
dollars upfront or and strange phrasing

210
00:08:29,240 --> 00:08:31,730
I know you can basically get ransomware

211
00:08:31,730 --> 00:08:34,429
as a service which means that you can go

212
00:08:34,429 --> 00:08:37,730
on the dark web and pay someone to do

213
00:08:37,730 --> 00:08:39,260
the ransomware for you and then they

214
00:08:39,260 --> 00:08:41,299
effectively clip the ticket and take

215
00:08:41,299 --> 00:08:43,789
some of your profit if we keep going

216
00:08:43,789 --> 00:08:46,910
around there you can see DDoS costs just

217
00:08:46,910 --> 00:08:49,250
under $800 a month um

218
00:08:49,250 --> 00:08:51,170
promise' counts of course a very cheap

219
00:08:51,170 --> 00:08:53,810
and will you know if you've ever looked

220
00:08:53,810 --> 00:08:56,900
at a website calls have I been poned and

221
00:08:56,900 --> 00:08:59,330
put your email in no doubt one of your

222
00:08:59,330 --> 00:09:01,550
emails that you use in your everyday

223
00:09:01,550 --> 00:09:03,560
life will have been in some kind of

224
00:09:03,560 --> 00:09:06,110
breach and if you use the same username

225
00:09:06,110 --> 00:09:09,770
and password both in any more than one

226
00:09:09,770 --> 00:09:11,600
place and it's compromised in one place

227
00:09:11,600 --> 00:09:13,460
then basically your username password

228
00:09:13,460 --> 00:09:16,970
combination is out on the dark web for

229
00:09:16,970 --> 00:09:19,100
someone to buy and potentially use now

230
00:09:19,100 --> 00:09:21,680
if we were all in person I would be

231
00:09:21,680 --> 00:09:23,900
asking if anybody wanted to admit that

232
00:09:23,900 --> 00:09:25,640
they use the same username password

233
00:09:25,640 --> 00:09:28,220
combination in real life obviously I

234
00:09:28,220 --> 00:09:30,680
can't do that but I'm pretty sure that

235
00:09:30,680 --> 00:09:32,840
most of you have done that at some point

236
00:09:32,840 --> 00:09:36,020
during your lives hopefully your on

237
00:09:36,020 --> 00:09:37,370
getting rid of it now because you're all

238
00:09:37,370 --> 00:09:39,670
good responsible security professionals

239
00:09:39,670 --> 00:09:43,040
but again the point here is just to see

240
00:09:43,040 --> 00:09:45,170
like it doesn't take much and you may

241
00:09:45,170 --> 00:09:46,970
know as well I only discovered this

242
00:09:46,970 --> 00:09:50,060
recently if you a really common attack

243
00:09:50,060 --> 00:09:52,160
by teenagers is when they're playing

244
00:09:52,160 --> 00:09:55,760
online gaming systems and there are DDoS

245
00:09:55,760 --> 00:09:57,860
solutions that cost like a couple of

246
00:09:57,860 --> 00:10:00,020
dollars and they go and feed us their

247
00:10:00,020 --> 00:10:02,630
rivals in fortnight or whatever it is

248
00:10:02,630 --> 00:10:07,310
Call of Duty etc so you know the

249
00:10:07,310 --> 00:10:09,860
environment is sort of so easy it's so

250
00:10:09,860 --> 00:10:12,440
so easy to get attacked so this is why

251
00:10:12,440 --> 00:10:15,080
you know we really need to be concerned

252
00:10:15,080 --> 00:10:17,360
and not just about the big scary zero

253
00:10:17,360 --> 00:10:19,280
days like it's the more common attacks

254
00:10:19,280 --> 00:10:21,290
which actually are you know more

255
00:10:21,290 --> 00:10:25,430
prevalent in the environment so typical

256
00:10:25,430 --> 00:10:28,430
security operations issues these again

257
00:10:28,430 --> 00:10:30,860
are not new to many disconnected

258
00:10:30,860 --> 00:10:32,810
products many people will say to you

259
00:10:32,810 --> 00:10:34,820
this is a single pane of glass you can

260
00:10:34,820 --> 00:10:37,310
just do everything from this one console

261
00:10:37,310 --> 00:10:40,280
that's very rarely true it's it's very

262
00:10:40,280 --> 00:10:41,839
difficult to have all your different

263
00:10:41,839 --> 00:10:43,670
products talk to each other especially

264
00:10:43,670 --> 00:10:45,650
if you're running a large complex

265
00:10:45,650 --> 00:10:48,200
enterprise environment and you have lots

266
00:10:48,200 --> 00:10:51,020
of different vendors not enough stock

267
00:10:51,020 --> 00:10:53,780
anomalous now that again it doesn't

268
00:10:53,780 --> 00:10:55,280
matter on the size of your organization

269
00:10:55,280 --> 00:10:56,650
whether you're big or small a

270
00:10:56,650 --> 00:10:59,450
well-trained soccer analyst are hard to

271
00:10:59,450 --> 00:11:01,249
come by and

272
00:11:01,249 --> 00:11:03,109
whether you're a big organization that

273
00:11:03,109 --> 00:11:04,489
needs a hundred or you're a smaller

274
00:11:04,489 --> 00:11:07,129
organization that needs five it can

275
00:11:07,129 --> 00:11:08,720
still be hard once you actually fill

276
00:11:08,720 --> 00:11:11,449
those those seats which of course means

277
00:11:11,449 --> 00:11:13,129
that the load on your other sock analyst

278
00:11:13,129 --> 00:11:14,720
is increased um

279
00:11:14,720 --> 00:11:16,939
environments definitely getting more

280
00:11:16,939 --> 00:11:20,209
complex I mean if you're moving looking

281
00:11:20,209 --> 00:11:22,279
at moving to the cloud most businesses

282
00:11:22,279 --> 00:11:25,189
are not 100% cloud even Microsoft isn't

283
00:11:25,189 --> 00:11:27,829
so you've often got a hybrid environment

284
00:11:27,829 --> 00:11:29,209
where you'll have some one premise you

285
00:11:29,209 --> 00:11:31,100
have something in the cloud you may even

286
00:11:31,100 --> 00:11:33,529
have more things in the cloud as well in

287
00:11:33,529 --> 00:11:35,660
a different cloud so environments are

288
00:11:35,660 --> 00:11:37,309
getting more and more complex and to

289
00:11:37,309 --> 00:11:39,109
maintain monitoring and visibility over

290
00:11:39,109 --> 00:11:41,439
that is a real challenge

291
00:11:41,439 --> 00:11:46,279
most Sox also depend on manual processes

292
00:11:46,279 --> 00:11:48,619
now going forward it's great we've got

293
00:11:48,619 --> 00:11:51,069
automation which I will talk about later

294
00:11:51,069 --> 00:11:54,019
but you know a lot of Sox if you've ever

295
00:11:54,019 --> 00:11:55,519
worked in a sock you probably know that

296
00:11:55,519 --> 00:11:56,600
there are some quite time-consuming

297
00:11:56,600 --> 00:11:59,569
manual processes that they have to do to

298
00:11:59,569 --> 00:12:03,379
correlate things or verify try and

299
00:12:03,379 --> 00:12:05,959
verify false positives etc and that can

300
00:12:05,959 --> 00:12:07,939
be really time-consuming and combined

301
00:12:07,939 --> 00:12:10,459
with not enough staff it can mean that a

302
00:12:10,459 --> 00:12:12,939
lot of alerts go unanswered or

303
00:12:12,939 --> 00:12:16,309
unaddressed some research through recent

304
00:12:16,309 --> 00:12:18,199
research and I forget the source or I

305
00:12:18,199 --> 00:12:21,169
apologize to the source that I read this

306
00:12:21,169 --> 00:12:24,980
from but something like 45% of sock

307
00:12:24,980 --> 00:12:28,160
alerts are never acknowledged typically

308
00:12:28,160 --> 00:12:31,100
which is actually quite a lot and again

309
00:12:31,100 --> 00:12:33,199
this is just because of the being able

310
00:12:33,199 --> 00:12:35,720
to scale thing and lastly too many

311
00:12:35,720 --> 00:12:39,799
alerts you know we get false positives

312
00:12:39,799 --> 00:12:41,299
and security operations you're always

313
00:12:41,299 --> 00:12:43,549
going to get false positives the idea is

314
00:12:43,549 --> 00:12:45,679
to reduce them as much as you can but

315
00:12:45,679 --> 00:12:47,539
you're never gonna completely eliminate

316
00:12:47,539 --> 00:12:50,569
the risk that a false positive that a

317
00:12:50,569 --> 00:12:52,759
false positive is going to occur and

318
00:12:52,759 --> 00:12:54,470
your sock analyst of which you don't

319
00:12:54,470 --> 00:12:57,829
have many of anyway will spend far too

320
00:12:57,829 --> 00:12:59,569
long looking at something that turns out

321
00:12:59,569 --> 00:13:02,179
to not be an issue and you know this is

322
00:13:02,179 --> 00:13:05,209
kind of a circle that goes around and

323
00:13:05,209 --> 00:13:08,359
the these issues still exist in the

324
00:13:08,359 --> 00:13:10,980
modern environment too but

325
00:13:10,980 --> 00:13:13,170
haven't really changed so how we can

326
00:13:13,170 --> 00:13:15,240
address them has change but generally

327
00:13:15,240 --> 00:13:17,820
the actual problems are still the same I

328
00:13:17,820 --> 00:13:20,130
think my I think my Simpsons me give his

329
00:13:20,130 --> 00:13:25,769
fairly obvious there I have to kind of I

330
00:13:25,769 --> 00:13:27,690
have to talk about single pane of glass

331
00:13:27,690 --> 00:13:29,940
many many people talk about single pane

332
00:13:29,940 --> 00:13:33,300
of glass in my time and security it is

333
00:13:33,300 --> 00:13:36,180
pretty difficult to get there it's not

334
00:13:36,180 --> 00:13:39,570
impossible but it can it is very very

335
00:13:39,570 --> 00:13:42,149
challenging I think most businesses

336
00:13:42,149 --> 00:13:44,639
realistically should aim for may be as

337
00:13:44,639 --> 00:13:47,639
few panes of glass as possible it's

338
00:13:47,639 --> 00:13:49,110
certainly not practical for a stock

339
00:13:49,110 --> 00:13:51,149
analyst to look through I don't know 10

340
00:13:51,149 --> 00:13:54,029
15 portals and I have seen things like

341
00:13:54,029 --> 00:13:55,829
that and you should be trying to reduce

342
00:13:55,829 --> 00:13:58,889
it maybe to two or three and if you can

343
00:13:58,889 --> 00:14:01,410
get to one perfect but I just sort of

344
00:14:01,410 --> 00:14:03,300
have to kind of shatter the single pane

345
00:14:03,300 --> 00:14:04,620
of glass thing because it's very

346
00:14:04,620 --> 00:14:06,630
difficult to achieve and if anybody has

347
00:14:06,630 --> 00:14:08,339
and you want to tell me about it at the

348
00:14:08,339 --> 00:14:11,160
end I would love to hear because well

349
00:14:11,160 --> 00:14:14,130
Don you if you've done it but my point

350
00:14:14,130 --> 00:14:16,079
is don't beat yourself off if you can't

351
00:14:16,079 --> 00:14:18,089
get there immediately or even if you

352
00:14:18,089 --> 00:14:20,310
never quite get there because you know

353
00:14:20,310 --> 00:14:22,920
it's very tricky it really is it's it's

354
00:14:22,920 --> 00:14:25,350
an ideal state that yeah not many can

355
00:14:25,350 --> 00:14:27,600
get to UM

356
00:14:27,600 --> 00:14:31,079
another problem is silos and this is

357
00:14:31,079 --> 00:14:32,670
again a problem that's wider than just

358
00:14:32,670 --> 00:14:34,980
in security operations but as my talk is

359
00:14:34,980 --> 00:14:37,889
about security operations what we find

360
00:14:37,889 --> 00:14:40,769
is an attacker isn't going to an

361
00:14:40,769 --> 00:14:45,899
attacker isn't going to just look at one

362
00:14:45,899 --> 00:14:48,240
particular one particular part of your

363
00:14:48,240 --> 00:14:49,860
organization so if you've got your

364
00:14:49,860 --> 00:14:52,230
Wintel team if you've got your identity

365
00:14:52,230 --> 00:14:53,579
team if you've got your cloud team

366
00:14:53,579 --> 00:14:55,410
that's great but if someone breaches

367
00:14:55,410 --> 00:14:57,569
your environment like they're not going

368
00:14:57,569 --> 00:14:59,519
to look through they're not just gonna

369
00:14:59,519 --> 00:15:01,440
stay in your little silo that fits with

370
00:15:01,440 --> 00:15:04,139
your organizational structure and it can

371
00:15:04,139 --> 00:15:06,110
offer and it can make security

372
00:15:06,110 --> 00:15:08,639
operations people it can make that job

373
00:15:08,639 --> 00:15:11,819
very difficult I don't know this is what

374
00:15:11,819 --> 00:15:13,680
came up on gear for silos I thought it

375
00:15:13,680 --> 00:15:16,319
was quite funny but I think it's the US

376
00:15:16,319 --> 00:15:18,810
team Olympics team for something

377
00:15:18,810 --> 00:15:20,819
beg your pardon US team I don't know

378
00:15:20,819 --> 00:15:22,230
can't remember specifically what you

379
00:15:22,230 --> 00:15:24,930
were but you know we can see here

380
00:15:24,930 --> 00:15:27,480
an attacker will go across all of these

381
00:15:27,480 --> 00:15:29,810
different all of these different silos

382
00:15:29,810 --> 00:15:33,060
and they don't care you know I have a

383
00:15:33,060 --> 00:15:35,430
sticker which I should have got out onto

384
00:15:35,430 --> 00:15:37,200
my desk right now so I could have put it

385
00:15:37,200 --> 00:15:39,360
up to the camera if you follow me on

386
00:15:39,360 --> 00:15:40,560
Twitter you may have seen it before

387
00:15:40,560 --> 00:15:43,140
anyway it says that's out of scope says

388
00:15:43,140 --> 00:15:45,920
no attacks said no attacker ever because

389
00:15:45,920 --> 00:15:49,529
unlike a pen tester or under unlike

390
00:15:49,529 --> 00:15:53,670
anything else you know an attacker is

391
00:15:53,670 --> 00:15:55,050
just gonna go through environment and

392
00:15:55,050 --> 00:15:57,690
take and destroy or infiltrate whatever

393
00:15:57,690 --> 00:16:00,300
they can like they don't care so these

394
00:16:00,300 --> 00:16:03,300
silos they're not great from an

395
00:16:03,300 --> 00:16:04,470
organizational but an operational

396
00:16:04,470 --> 00:16:06,330
perspective anyway but they really

397
00:16:06,330 --> 00:16:08,400
really do not help security operations

398
00:16:08,400 --> 00:16:10,200
because an attacker is just gonna go

399
00:16:10,200 --> 00:16:12,480
across the whole thing and if your

400
00:16:12,480 --> 00:16:17,490
security operations is is is put into

401
00:16:17,490 --> 00:16:19,650
different silos as well that can be

402
00:16:19,650 --> 00:16:22,080
really really difficult because if you

403
00:16:22,080 --> 00:16:23,520
can only look at your identity if you

404
00:16:23,520 --> 00:16:25,320
can only look at your endpoint you can

405
00:16:25,320 --> 00:16:26,700
only look at your applications you can't

406
00:16:26,700 --> 00:16:29,339
correlate what's going on so it's really

407
00:16:29,339 --> 00:16:30,930
really important that we try and get rid

408
00:16:30,930 --> 00:16:33,800
of this and this is a hallmark of

409
00:16:33,800 --> 00:16:36,210
traditional security operations that

410
00:16:36,210 --> 00:16:40,670
this was often a very big challenge so

411
00:16:40,670 --> 00:16:43,560
by the way anybody wants stickers feel

412
00:16:43,560 --> 00:16:45,120
free I'm gonna show you some more

413
00:16:45,120 --> 00:16:47,610
pictures coming up feel free to DM me on

414
00:16:47,610 --> 00:16:50,220
Twitter New Zealand has post offices

415
00:16:50,220 --> 00:16:51,870
open and I'm always happy to cheer

416
00:16:51,870 --> 00:16:53,220
someone up by sending you some security

417
00:16:53,220 --> 00:16:56,130
stickers but how did we use security

418
00:16:56,130 --> 00:16:59,910
operations on-premise then so this is

419
00:16:59,910 --> 00:17:02,130
the really really cheesy really really

420
00:17:02,130 --> 00:17:05,069
cheesy analogy but it is it still holds

421
00:17:05,069 --> 00:17:09,119
true even today which is the castle and

422
00:17:09,119 --> 00:17:12,300
the big walls and the moat so when we

423
00:17:12,300 --> 00:17:13,949
did security operations on premise we

424
00:17:13,949 --> 00:17:16,709
were very focused on taking information

425
00:17:16,709 --> 00:17:19,140
from the network particularly the

426
00:17:19,140 --> 00:17:21,959
external perimeter so firewalls anything

427
00:17:21,959 --> 00:17:25,589
that was in the DMZ etc and a lot of our

428
00:17:25,589 --> 00:17:27,480
detection and how we picked up strange

429
00:17:27,480 --> 00:17:30,000
behavior was based on the network but

430
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:32,130
again inherently the the problem with

431
00:17:32,130 --> 00:17:34,350
this model of course is that if the

432
00:17:34,350 --> 00:17:36,510
attackers did manage to breach the

433
00:17:36,510 --> 00:17:37,980
perimeter and

434
00:17:37,980 --> 00:17:40,260
they'd gone in undetected there wasn't

435
00:17:40,260 --> 00:17:44,150
nearly as much not nearly as much

436
00:17:44,150 --> 00:17:46,740
detection and logging within the

437
00:17:46,740 --> 00:17:49,140
environment itself so that potentially

438
00:17:49,140 --> 00:17:52,950
was a gap and and like I said we I have

439
00:17:52,950 --> 00:17:54,660
talked about this analogy to death and

440
00:17:54,660 --> 00:17:56,340
other talks I'm sure you've heard the

441
00:17:56,340 --> 00:17:58,770
castle moat analogy but we do need to

442
00:17:58,770 --> 00:18:01,530
remember that although taking from the

443
00:18:01,530 --> 00:18:03,419
network is important I never tell anyone

444
00:18:03,419 --> 00:18:07,080
to not take from it there are still a

445
00:18:07,080 --> 00:18:09,290
lot of value that you can get from

446
00:18:09,290 --> 00:18:11,820
logging certain types of network events

447
00:18:11,820 --> 00:18:13,650
you know we do need to be looking at

448
00:18:13,650 --> 00:18:15,960
detection at layers of the stack going

449
00:18:15,960 --> 00:18:20,910
forward so the other thing that we also

450
00:18:20,910 --> 00:18:23,580
used to be very big on and this still

451
00:18:23,580 --> 00:18:25,980
does this miser is still around today as

452
00:18:25,980 --> 00:18:29,549
well coming back to the title of my

453
00:18:29,549 --> 00:18:31,500
presentation this collection is not

454
00:18:31,500 --> 00:18:34,919
detection now the you certainly the

455
00:18:34,919 --> 00:18:36,419
traditional mindset for security

456
00:18:36,419 --> 00:18:38,010
operations was collect all the things

457
00:18:38,010 --> 00:18:40,799
every single log you could get collect

458
00:18:40,799 --> 00:18:44,160
it put it in your scene but we know that

459
00:18:44,160 --> 00:18:45,690
a lot of these logs

460
00:18:45,690 --> 00:18:47,700
no one ever around detections on those

461
00:18:47,700 --> 00:18:50,100
nor did they do proactive hunting on

462
00:18:50,100 --> 00:18:52,830
them and then really if you're not doing

463
00:18:52,830 --> 00:18:54,000
any of those things

464
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:56,220
is it really worth collecting them now

465
00:18:56,220 --> 00:18:58,320
obviously that is an individual

466
00:18:58,320 --> 00:19:01,169
businesses final decision to make

467
00:19:01,169 --> 00:19:04,410
themselves but I would always say to you

468
00:19:04,410 --> 00:19:05,549
if you're looking at your security

469
00:19:05,549 --> 00:19:09,240
operations like look look at the types

470
00:19:09,240 --> 00:19:10,679
of logs you're collecting are you

471
00:19:10,679 --> 00:19:12,030
actually doing anything with them

472
00:19:12,030 --> 00:19:15,450
because if you're not you know why are

473
00:19:15,450 --> 00:19:16,860
you collecting them or at least why are

474
00:19:16,860 --> 00:19:19,110
you putting them into a seam because if

475
00:19:19,110 --> 00:19:21,179
it's going a seam if it's on-prem of

476
00:19:21,179 --> 00:19:24,000
course an on-prem seam will eventually

477
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:25,770
run out space and it degrades the

478
00:19:25,770 --> 00:19:28,049
performance as it gets over full and if

479
00:19:28,049 --> 00:19:30,120
you're using a cloud-based seam then of

480
00:19:30,120 --> 00:19:33,510
course you're typically paying per per

481
00:19:33,510 --> 00:19:35,880
gig or whatever ingestion charge so

482
00:19:35,880 --> 00:19:37,740
you'll be spending more money but not

483
00:19:37,740 --> 00:19:40,200
really getting anything out of it so you

484
00:19:40,200 --> 00:19:44,580
know definitely definitely please

485
00:19:44,580 --> 00:19:47,730
rethink your collection strategy don't

486
00:19:47,730 --> 00:19:49,500
don't just put things in for the sake of

487
00:19:49,500 --> 00:19:49,919
it

488
00:19:49,919 --> 00:19:51,690
again if we were in person I

489
00:19:51,690 --> 00:19:53,790
would happily have given every one of

490
00:19:53,790 --> 00:19:56,910
these stickers again if you want one DM

491
00:19:56,910 --> 00:19:57,630
me on Twitter

492
00:19:57,630 --> 00:20:02,070
I'm sure I can sort you out and as you

493
00:20:02,070 --> 00:20:05,190
can see essentially I've heard the cat

494
00:20:05,190 --> 00:20:07,230
lady we don't want to be crazy hoarders

495
00:20:07,230 --> 00:20:09,330
and just have well this lady has

496
00:20:09,330 --> 00:20:11,340
millions of cats but you know we don't

497
00:20:11,340 --> 00:20:14,220
want to we don't want to just spend

498
00:20:14,220 --> 00:20:17,010
money and hoard lots and lots and lots

499
00:20:17,010 --> 00:20:18,870
of logs don't ask me why I went for cats

500
00:20:18,870 --> 00:20:21,420
and logs basically if I run out of ideas

501
00:20:21,420 --> 00:20:24,570
I don't typically go for cats so yeah

502
00:20:24,570 --> 00:20:30,360
there's cat lady so next let's talk a

503
00:20:30,360 --> 00:20:32,490
little bit about I've told basically

504
00:20:32,490 --> 00:20:33,960
talks about the problems that we have

505
00:20:33,960 --> 00:20:36,510
the challenges and how we used to do it

506
00:20:36,510 --> 00:20:41,480
but what should we do going forward so

507
00:20:41,480 --> 00:20:43,770
when you're doing your modern suck-ups

508
00:20:43,770 --> 00:20:46,440
you've basically got a choice assuming

509
00:20:46,440 --> 00:20:50,310
the you know most organizations now are

510
00:20:50,310 --> 00:20:52,710
looking at least moving some of the

511
00:20:52,710 --> 00:20:54,620
workloads into into a cloud environment

512
00:20:54,620 --> 00:20:57,090
you've got to kind of make a choice how

513
00:20:57,090 --> 00:20:58,740
you want to sort of have a focus for

514
00:20:58,740 --> 00:21:01,230
your modern SEC Ops you could go fully

515
00:21:01,230 --> 00:21:03,990
cloud you could do hybrid so you could

516
00:21:03,990 --> 00:21:06,360
have some of your security operations

517
00:21:06,360 --> 00:21:08,400
done with on-premise systems some of it

518
00:21:08,400 --> 00:21:10,650
done in the cloud or you could still

519
00:21:10,650 --> 00:21:12,930
stay completely on Prem and for that

520
00:21:12,930 --> 00:21:15,270
number two the hybrid that could be like

521
00:21:15,270 --> 00:21:17,370
an interim stay or it could be something

522
00:21:17,370 --> 00:21:21,600
that stays permanently um to be honest

523
00:21:21,600 --> 00:21:23,220
with you a lot of businesses if you've

524
00:21:23,220 --> 00:21:25,740
got an on-prem seem that you've spent a

525
00:21:25,740 --> 00:21:27,720
lot of money invested a lot of time in

526
00:21:27,720 --> 00:21:30,060
it wouldn't expect anybody to just say

527
00:21:30,060 --> 00:21:32,070
right we're getting rid of that tomorrow

528
00:21:32,070 --> 00:21:34,070
I don't think that's really realistic

529
00:21:34,070 --> 00:21:39,120
but certainly if you're doing as many

530
00:21:39,120 --> 00:21:40,980
businesses are and organizations are now

531
00:21:40,980 --> 00:21:44,370
doing a cloud first journey then it does

532
00:21:44,370 --> 00:21:46,560
make sense to as your workloads go into

533
00:21:46,560 --> 00:21:49,590
a cloud they would be connected up to a

534
00:21:49,590 --> 00:21:52,620
cloud base seem and a car and cloud

535
00:21:52,620 --> 00:21:55,410
based monitoring tools and then probably

536
00:21:55,410 --> 00:21:57,570
in time you might want to phase out the

537
00:21:57,570 --> 00:22:00,750
on-premise stuff but again I can't tell

538
00:22:00,750 --> 00:22:03,120
you you know there's sort of a wide

539
00:22:03,120 --> 00:22:04,650
range of businesses and

540
00:22:04,650 --> 00:22:07,050
industries in the world what you need to

541
00:22:07,050 --> 00:22:10,110
do there is gonna really depend on your

542
00:22:10,110 --> 00:22:12,150
business but I guess all I'm saying is

543
00:22:12,150 --> 00:22:14,310
make a conscious choice about what

544
00:22:14,310 --> 00:22:16,500
you're going to do because what we often

545
00:22:16,500 --> 00:22:20,240
find as well is that it can be hard

546
00:22:20,240 --> 00:22:22,710
Claire and I worked with a number of

547
00:22:22,710 --> 00:22:27,210
different clouds getting cloud logs into

548
00:22:27,210 --> 00:22:29,850
an on-premise seam again I'm not I'm not

549
00:22:29,850 --> 00:22:31,530
even naming particular platforms here

550
00:22:31,530 --> 00:22:33,120
there's no need because it seems to be a

551
00:22:33,120 --> 00:22:36,300
very general rule it can be quite

552
00:22:36,300 --> 00:22:39,540
challenging to to get them in and get

553
00:22:39,540 --> 00:22:41,790
them being processed again that's more

554
00:22:41,790 --> 00:22:44,790
of like a legacy technology legacy

555
00:22:44,790 --> 00:22:47,850
technology and more modern technology

556
00:22:47,850 --> 00:22:49,740
compatibility thing more than anything

557
00:22:49,740 --> 00:22:52,080
so please please like at least think

558
00:22:52,080 --> 00:22:53,430
about what you're doing in this space

559
00:22:53,430 --> 00:22:58,770
and yeah and what so what should you

560
00:22:58,770 --> 00:23:00,360
collect cuz I know I've just told you

561
00:23:00,360 --> 00:23:02,430
you know please don't collect everything

562
00:23:02,430 --> 00:23:04,920
be mindful of what you're collecting but

563
00:23:04,920 --> 00:23:07,140
really what I'm saying here is you need

564
00:23:07,140 --> 00:23:08,340
to collect logs from your entire

565
00:23:08,340 --> 00:23:11,310
application stack and so don't just not

566
00:23:11,310 --> 00:23:13,170
just your infrastructure if you're using

567
00:23:13,170 --> 00:23:15,120
like containers Kuban Eddie's not just

568
00:23:15,120 --> 00:23:17,190
your Orchestrator not the pods not just

569
00:23:17,190 --> 00:23:19,290
the application this is still going

570
00:23:19,290 --> 00:23:20,820
towards defense-in-depth

571
00:23:20,820 --> 00:23:23,220
so do do it having detections and

572
00:23:23,220 --> 00:23:25,170
protections at every layer of the stack

573
00:23:25,170 --> 00:23:27,390
so that's your identity

574
00:23:27,390 --> 00:23:29,040
it's your virtual machine it's your

575
00:23:29,040 --> 00:23:31,740
application it's down at the physical

576
00:23:31,740 --> 00:23:34,050
layer it's down at the network layer and

577
00:23:34,050 --> 00:23:35,700
when we're moving into these hybrid

578
00:23:35,700 --> 00:23:37,260
environments some of this might be done

579
00:23:37,260 --> 00:23:39,420
by a cloud provider as well so I guess

580
00:23:39,420 --> 00:23:41,310
it's more about mapping that out and

581
00:23:41,310 --> 00:23:44,100
understanding and every time you can you

582
00:23:44,100 --> 00:23:45,600
can take a log you know ask yourself

583
00:23:45,600 --> 00:23:48,330
what will we do with this log what what

584
00:23:48,330 --> 00:23:50,610
is it what detections can we actually

585
00:23:50,610 --> 00:23:53,700
configure on it or what if we wanted to

586
00:23:53,700 --> 00:23:55,410
do hunting through the environment

587
00:23:55,410 --> 00:23:57,000
what could we find using these logs

588
00:23:57,000 --> 00:23:59,040
because make sure the log has value

589
00:23:59,040 --> 00:24:01,260
otherwise we probably don't need to add

590
00:24:01,260 --> 00:24:08,100
it so then looking at by the way this me

591
00:24:08,100 --> 00:24:09,480
I just realized I didn't explain this

592
00:24:09,480 --> 00:24:12,660
this is what I got for hoarding another

593
00:24:12,660 --> 00:24:15,840
hoarding gift they're hoarding gifts

594
00:24:15,840 --> 00:24:17,740
apparently you do not get very many

595
00:24:17,740 --> 00:24:21,970
the monkey fee so there you go um who so

596
00:24:21,970 --> 00:24:26,170
you know I've talked about this in other

597
00:24:26,170 --> 00:24:27,700
presentations before I've done about

598
00:24:27,700 --> 00:24:29,980
moving to cloud and modernizing your

599
00:24:29,980 --> 00:24:33,340
security but you need to look at we

600
00:24:33,340 --> 00:24:35,200
relook at the security tools that you

601
00:24:35,200 --> 00:24:37,450
may be already ingesting security

602
00:24:37,450 --> 00:24:40,630
visibility or security logs from um you

603
00:24:40,630 --> 00:24:42,100
know will they get you the visibility

604
00:24:42,100 --> 00:24:44,170
you need in the cloud and in your hybrid

605
00:24:44,170 --> 00:24:46,510
environment so when I talk about

606
00:24:46,510 --> 00:24:48,940
security operations and visibility tools

607
00:24:48,940 --> 00:24:50,710
like we're talking about things like for

608
00:24:50,710 --> 00:24:52,179
durability scanning of course I've

609
00:24:52,179 --> 00:24:53,790
talked a lot about seeing already

610
00:24:53,790 --> 00:24:56,530
runtime security auditing policy tools

611
00:24:56,530 --> 00:24:58,840
image repositories all of these things

612
00:24:58,840 --> 00:25:01,600
will create generate logs that could be

613
00:25:01,600 --> 00:25:04,660
of use but you need to make sure that

614
00:25:04,660 --> 00:25:06,070
they're actually giving you the

615
00:25:06,070 --> 00:25:08,410
visibility you need you basically need

616
00:25:08,410 --> 00:25:10,630
to some summer tools that you've used

617
00:25:10,630 --> 00:25:12,970
on-premise will probably be fine or they

618
00:25:12,970 --> 00:25:14,890
may just need an add-on some of them you

619
00:25:14,890 --> 00:25:17,800
may need to change altogether again I

620
00:25:17,800 --> 00:25:20,380
can't give you specific guidance I can't

621
00:25:20,380 --> 00:25:22,480
sort of concretely tell you what you do

622
00:25:22,480 --> 00:25:25,360
and don't need it's it's very much gonna

623
00:25:25,360 --> 00:25:27,550
be context dependent but the idea is

624
00:25:27,550 --> 00:25:29,020
that just giving you some things to

625
00:25:29,020 --> 00:25:31,510
think about and last thing today is

626
00:25:31,510 --> 00:25:33,040
definitely not the day to talk about

627
00:25:33,040 --> 00:25:35,650
paid versus OSS open-source tools

628
00:25:35,650 --> 00:25:38,230
because that is a big topic in itself

629
00:25:38,230 --> 00:25:40,570
you can get some great open source tools

630
00:25:40,570 --> 00:25:42,850
out there but again whether or not they

631
00:25:42,850 --> 00:25:45,340
do what you need typically they may need

632
00:25:45,340 --> 00:25:47,020
a bit more maintenance or engineering

633
00:25:47,020 --> 00:25:49,809
work to be able to use them this is

634
00:25:49,809 --> 00:25:52,080
probably not the day for that but again

635
00:25:52,080 --> 00:25:55,929
just have these points um you know the

636
00:25:55,929 --> 00:25:57,190
kind of things you should be looking at

637
00:25:57,190 --> 00:25:59,500
when you're when you're assessing what

638
00:25:59,500 --> 00:26:04,450
you want to do and then when when should

639
00:26:04,450 --> 00:26:05,920
you be doing security operations this

640
00:26:05,920 --> 00:26:07,720
should be obvious but the only reason I

641
00:26:07,720 --> 00:26:09,280
picked this was because of the because

642
00:26:09,280 --> 00:26:10,660
of the little dude who I forget his

643
00:26:10,660 --> 00:26:12,580
name's panting you should be doing it

644
00:26:12,580 --> 00:26:15,610
all the time so you know you need to be

645
00:26:15,610 --> 00:26:16,840
doing security operations throughout

646
00:26:16,840 --> 00:26:18,880
your entire lifecycle now this is

647
00:26:18,880 --> 00:26:21,100
getting more back into the dev setup

648
00:26:21,100 --> 00:26:23,380
side of things but from integrating

649
00:26:23,380 --> 00:26:25,240
security into development which is great

650
00:26:25,240 --> 00:26:28,030
that information that that information

651
00:26:28,030 --> 00:26:30,190
that you're building and

652
00:26:30,190 --> 00:26:31,899
visibility you're giving should be being

653
00:26:31,899 --> 00:26:33,700
fed into your security operations team

654
00:26:33,700 --> 00:26:36,330
so from creating something to storing it

655
00:26:36,330 --> 00:26:39,250
to deploying it to its runtime and then

656
00:26:39,250 --> 00:26:41,860
teardown we should be able to see all of

657
00:26:41,860 --> 00:26:45,399
those things because attackers are

658
00:26:45,399 --> 00:26:47,289
always finding new ways to do things so

659
00:26:47,289 --> 00:26:49,120
if you don't understand what's going on

660
00:26:49,120 --> 00:26:50,769
in your environment you can't possibly

661
00:26:50,769 --> 00:26:53,139
understand what's normal if you don't

662
00:26:53,139 --> 00:26:54,490
understand what's normal

663
00:26:54,490 --> 00:26:55,899
you can't start to understand what's

664
00:26:55,899 --> 00:26:58,269
abnormal now this is a huge task and

665
00:26:58,269 --> 00:27:00,879
it's really easy for me to stamp sit

666
00:27:00,879 --> 00:27:03,669
here talking to my laptop on my webcam

667
00:27:03,669 --> 00:27:07,000
telling you I know I've worked in

668
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:08,980
internal security teams this is a huge

669
00:27:08,980 --> 00:27:12,730
huge challenge but at least you know to

670
00:27:12,730 --> 00:27:14,620
stop and it's a journey for everybody

671
00:27:14,620 --> 00:27:16,629
but at least you know by by having these

672
00:27:16,629 --> 00:27:18,279
talking points and starting to think

673
00:27:18,279 --> 00:27:20,350
about it you can start to move your way

674
00:27:20,350 --> 00:27:24,940
there so the last thing I want to talk

675
00:27:24,940 --> 00:27:29,289
about is use cases now use I've got a

676
00:27:29,289 --> 00:27:31,509
thing at the moment about writing

677
00:27:31,509 --> 00:27:36,190
clickbait titles so if you want your top

678
00:27:36,190 --> 00:27:38,370
security operations hacked from me

679
00:27:38,370 --> 00:27:41,710
understand your use cases now the only

680
00:27:41,710 --> 00:27:43,629
bullet point I put as you can see three

681
00:27:43,629 --> 00:27:45,789
times is understand your use cases and

682
00:27:45,789 --> 00:27:48,490
the reason for this is I can't stress

683
00:27:48,490 --> 00:27:51,009
enough how important this is you can

684
00:27:51,009 --> 00:27:53,740
definitely get detection x' and typical

685
00:27:53,740 --> 00:27:56,889
use cases in a general you know anybody

686
00:27:56,889 --> 00:27:59,139
who uses cloud or anybody who uses a

687
00:27:59,139 --> 00:28:01,539
certain type of product a lot of vendors

688
00:28:01,539 --> 00:28:02,950
might make might suggest some

689
00:28:02,950 --> 00:28:06,179
recommended detections and use cases but

690
00:28:06,179 --> 00:28:09,549
you know every businesses use case will

691
00:28:09,549 --> 00:28:12,669
be different um and in order to do

692
00:28:12,669 --> 00:28:14,500
proper assessments if you're starting to

693
00:28:14,500 --> 00:28:16,840
modernize your suck-ups if you don't

694
00:28:16,840 --> 00:28:18,580
understand your use cases it's gonna be

695
00:28:18,580 --> 00:28:20,289
really difficult to justify what you're

696
00:28:20,289 --> 00:28:23,230
doing so if i give you an example so say

697
00:28:23,230 --> 00:28:26,639
you're a business and you need to know i

698
00:28:26,639 --> 00:28:31,779
don't know if you need to know that you

699
00:28:31,779 --> 00:28:33,429
know that all your users because this is

700
00:28:33,429 --> 00:28:35,679
quite relevant at the moment if any of

701
00:28:35,679 --> 00:28:37,899
your users log in in the country that

702
00:28:37,899 --> 00:28:40,840
they're currently not if log try and log

703
00:28:40,840 --> 00:28:42,690
into your corporate

704
00:28:42,690 --> 00:28:45,060
environment from a place where they

705
00:28:45,060 --> 00:28:47,190
don't normally work because of course at

706
00:28:47,190 --> 00:28:49,350
the moment we wouldn't expect to see

707
00:28:49,350 --> 00:28:51,030
employees probably moving around the

708
00:28:51,030 --> 00:28:54,330
world very much now if that's something

709
00:28:54,330 --> 00:28:57,150
that you need in your business then of

710
00:28:57,150 --> 00:28:58,380
course then you know how to write your

711
00:28:58,380 --> 00:29:01,680
detection you can say hey we want a rule

712
00:29:01,680 --> 00:29:03,840
that says if somebody logs in outside of

713
00:29:03,840 --> 00:29:07,500
the less standard country we want to

714
00:29:07,500 --> 00:29:09,990
raise up as a security issue now then

715
00:29:09,990 --> 00:29:12,000
you can work back from your use case and

716
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:13,680
say okay in order to build this

717
00:29:13,680 --> 00:29:17,100
detection how what logs do I need how do

718
00:29:17,100 --> 00:29:19,590
I do that and of course you can start

719
00:29:19,590 --> 00:29:21,450
relating it as well to my tree attack

720
00:29:21,450 --> 00:29:27,120
tactics etc and of course moving further

721
00:29:27,120 --> 00:29:30,000
up the chain if you need to justify new

722
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:32,070
tools or you need to justify why you

723
00:29:32,070 --> 00:29:36,360
need to ingest certain logs and/or take

724
00:29:36,360 --> 00:29:38,220
certain log sources or get some more

725
00:29:38,220 --> 00:29:40,320
visibility being able to do this mapping

726
00:29:40,320 --> 00:29:43,800
and explaining is so so important from a

727
00:29:43,800 --> 00:29:45,270
management perspective because you can

728
00:29:45,270 --> 00:29:48,120
say you know I need this and this is why

729
00:29:48,120 --> 00:29:50,220
I need it it's gonna it helps address

730
00:29:50,220 --> 00:29:52,950
these kind of attacks and we need this

731
00:29:52,950 --> 00:29:54,780
specifically for our environment because

732
00:29:54,780 --> 00:29:56,550
of X Y Z and you've got full

733
00:29:56,550 --> 00:29:59,700
traceability and wrapping and this

734
00:29:59,700 --> 00:30:01,560
doesn't there are not very many

735
00:30:01,560 --> 00:30:05,580
businesses do this it like it sounds

736
00:30:05,580 --> 00:30:07,920
really basic but not a lot of businesses

737
00:30:07,920 --> 00:30:09,870
do this and understand the use cases and

738
00:30:09,870 --> 00:30:12,530
whilst it's a time-consuming operation

739
00:30:12,530 --> 00:30:17,010
I'm not denying that at all it is so so

740
00:30:17,010 --> 00:30:18,960
valuable and will make a lot of these

741
00:30:18,960 --> 00:30:20,610
things that I've talked about and

742
00:30:20,610 --> 00:30:22,950
starting these activities so much easier

743
00:30:22,950 --> 00:30:25,290
if you do it so I can't stress enough

744
00:30:25,290 --> 00:30:27,690
please understand in your use cases

745
00:30:27,690 --> 00:30:30,630
please please PLEASE it will make me

746
00:30:30,630 --> 00:30:32,000
very very happy

747
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:38,790
um so um in conclusion then what you

748
00:30:38,790 --> 00:30:41,490
know I've only scratched the surface of

749
00:30:41,490 --> 00:30:44,640
this topic right um you know this is a

750
00:30:44,640 --> 00:30:47,250
huge huge thing I do talk to customers

751
00:30:47,250 --> 00:30:49,830
and people I work with about this all

752
00:30:49,830 --> 00:30:50,580
day every day

753
00:30:50,580 --> 00:30:52,350
and you know I've only got thirty five

754
00:30:52,350 --> 00:30:54,450
minutes to talk to you about it but you

755
00:30:54,450 --> 00:30:56,070
know in conclusion

756
00:30:56,070 --> 00:30:57,690
obviously we couldn't do a security

757
00:30:57,690 --> 00:30:59,550
operations talk without having

758
00:30:59,550 --> 00:31:02,660
everyone's favorite security related

759
00:31:02,660 --> 00:31:07,950
this is fine gif in here but you know um

760
00:31:07,950 --> 00:31:09,510
security operations is really really

761
00:31:09,510 --> 00:31:11,430
hard it's actually it's always been

762
00:31:11,430 --> 00:31:13,320
really hard we have some great great

763
00:31:13,320 --> 00:31:16,350
tools in the modern environment going

764
00:31:16,350 --> 00:31:19,860
into saw and automating things and me I

765
00:31:19,860 --> 00:31:23,100
don't really get the false positive rate

766
00:31:23,100 --> 00:31:25,500
much better but in order to do that

767
00:31:25,500 --> 00:31:26,850
people need to understand their

768
00:31:26,850 --> 00:31:28,440
environments which of course is the

769
00:31:28,440 --> 00:31:29,940
tricky thing because our environments

770
00:31:29,940 --> 00:31:32,750
accounting way way way more complicated

771
00:31:32,750 --> 00:31:35,940
so I mean I can't even profess to say

772
00:31:35,940 --> 00:31:37,620
I've barely even scratched the surface

773
00:31:37,620 --> 00:31:41,130
of this topic right now because it's so

774
00:31:41,130 --> 00:31:44,730
so so difficult but you know it's a

775
00:31:44,730 --> 00:31:47,460
journey for everyone please think about

776
00:31:47,460 --> 00:31:49,410
please especially when you're starting

777
00:31:49,410 --> 00:31:50,790
to transform your infrastructure

778
00:31:50,790 --> 00:31:53,070
transform your enterprise environment

779
00:31:53,070 --> 00:31:56,190
don't forget sack ops people do that

780
00:31:56,190 --> 00:31:59,030
needs to be looked at as well and

781
00:31:59,030 --> 00:32:01,050
obviously that there's a ton of

782
00:32:01,050 --> 00:32:05,370
resources online obviously feel free to

783
00:32:05,370 --> 00:32:08,520
hit me up directly on Twitter or

784
00:32:08,520 --> 00:32:10,590
whatever it's one of my favorite topics

785
00:32:10,590 --> 00:32:14,400
and I'm gonna leave it there and see if

786
00:32:14,400 --> 00:32:17,460
you have any questions because like I

787
00:32:17,460 --> 00:32:19,380
said could go on about this forever but

788
00:32:19,380 --> 00:32:21,600
unconscious of time so thank you for

789
00:32:21,600 --> 00:32:23,790
having me dev sack on it's been a

790
00:32:23,790 --> 00:32:25,500
pleasure for those of you who are

791
00:32:25,500 --> 00:32:27,600
listening I really hope you enjoyed it

792
00:32:27,600 --> 00:32:29,220
and that was useful and it gave you some

793
00:32:29,220 --> 00:32:32,610
things to think about and yeah that's me

794
00:32:32,610 --> 00:32:35,719
and thanks very much

795
00:32:48,050 --> 00:32:50,030
I'm not sure if people will talk for

796
00:32:50,030 --> 00:32:51,530
questions and while they're in the chat

797
00:32:51,530 --> 00:32:58,070
window oh you can't hear her there she

798
00:32:58,070 --> 00:33:01,160
is she's back oh I apologize I'm sitting

799
00:33:01,160 --> 00:33:03,260
here talking to myself gosh this is as

800
00:33:03,260 --> 00:33:07,960
bad as I can let me try that again so

801
00:33:07,960 --> 00:33:10,640
everyone else can hear to what extent

802
00:33:10,640 --> 00:33:13,430
can we trusts or tools to help address

803
00:33:13,430 --> 00:33:18,050
these concerns oh so so tools are really

804
00:33:18,050 --> 00:33:20,390
good sortal this is I think the hardest

805
00:33:20,390 --> 00:33:22,730
thing about set cops is that we cannot

806
00:33:22,730 --> 00:33:24,440
know that well it's the same in security

807
00:33:24,440 --> 00:33:27,530
right nothing's 100% so tools can if you

808
00:33:27,530 --> 00:33:30,230
saw tools can massively reduce your

809
00:33:30,230 --> 00:33:32,600
workload so but they're only gonna

810
00:33:32,600 --> 00:33:35,390
reduce your workload for standard things

811
00:33:35,390 --> 00:33:37,070
that you can say right some automation

812
00:33:37,070 --> 00:33:39,320
for so if you've got an alert that pops

813
00:33:39,320 --> 00:33:41,120
up in your environment that you know is

814
00:33:41,120 --> 00:33:42,830
benign you can clear it out with

815
00:33:42,830 --> 00:33:44,780
automation or if it's just an error that

816
00:33:44,780 --> 00:33:46,640
needs fixing and you see it time and

817
00:33:46,640 --> 00:33:49,010
time again soar is great for getting rid

818
00:33:49,010 --> 00:33:51,590
of repeatable things but the more

819
00:33:51,590 --> 00:33:53,480
complex things that are obviously going

820
00:33:53,480 --> 00:33:55,060
to come up at least from time to time

821
00:33:55,060 --> 00:33:57,500
when I don't think we'll ever get to the

822
00:33:57,500 --> 00:34:00,350
point where we can get you know that

823
00:34:00,350 --> 00:34:01,820
we're gonna completely remove humans

824
00:34:01,820 --> 00:34:05,180
from it so I know some people sometimes

825
00:34:05,180 --> 00:34:06,950
get scared thinking Sora's gonna like

826
00:34:06,950 --> 00:34:08,449
completely get rid of the people out of

827
00:34:08,449 --> 00:34:10,159
stack ops I don't believe that at all

828
00:34:10,159 --> 00:34:13,070
it's just gonna stop people well

829
00:34:13,070 --> 00:34:16,280
implemented saw should just make Peter

830
00:34:16,280 --> 00:34:18,500
security analysts or countless lives

831
00:34:18,500 --> 00:34:20,989
easier because they won't have to deal

832
00:34:20,989 --> 00:34:23,918
with the monotonous manual staff and

833
00:34:23,918 --> 00:34:27,050
they and it can also help just make

834
00:34:27,050 --> 00:34:28,580
their jobs easier so for things that

835
00:34:28,580 --> 00:34:30,020
might be a little bit more complicated

836
00:34:30,020 --> 00:34:32,210
you could still have some automation to

837
00:34:32,210 --> 00:34:34,760
do the repeatable tasks you know I fetch

838
00:34:34,760 --> 00:34:37,399
IP you know fetch more information from

839
00:34:37,399 --> 00:34:39,889
other places so they can concentrate on

840
00:34:39,889 --> 00:34:41,418
the stuff that's actually interesting

841
00:34:41,418 --> 00:34:43,730
and different so I think soar is great

842
00:34:43,730 --> 00:34:45,560
and I would definitely encourage you to

843
00:34:45,560 --> 00:34:48,409
use it because it's gonna it's not gonna

844
00:34:48,409 --> 00:34:50,030
get rid of people it's just gonna make

845
00:34:50,030 --> 00:34:51,949
people's lives who work in security

846
00:34:51,949 --> 00:34:53,840
operations more interesting I think

847
00:34:53,840 --> 00:34:56,989
that's my opinion anyway well you

848
00:34:56,989 --> 00:34:59,120
actually touched on the answer to

849
00:34:59,120 --> 00:35:00,830
another question that we had

850
00:35:00,830 --> 00:35:02,930
I'm gonna send you a different one then

851
00:35:02,930 --> 00:35:05,690
this one comes from Megan her question

852
00:35:05,690 --> 00:35:07,610
has to do with talking to leadership

853
00:35:07,610 --> 00:35:10,070
within an org can you provide any tried

854
00:35:10,070 --> 00:35:12,290
and true strategies to start improving

855
00:35:12,290 --> 00:35:16,910
suck-ups Oh tried and true I mean the

856
00:35:16,910 --> 00:35:18,800
obvious tried and true one of course I'm

857
00:35:18,800 --> 00:35:20,660
sure you know is usually if a company

858
00:35:20,660 --> 00:35:22,460
gets breached they normally have a lot

859
00:35:22,460 --> 00:35:25,820
more focus on SEC Ops but of course

860
00:35:25,820 --> 00:35:27,860
that's not and this has been you know

861
00:35:27,860 --> 00:35:30,080
the eternal security person struggle of

862
00:35:30,080 --> 00:35:32,600
course it's a bit late then if you've

863
00:35:32,600 --> 00:35:34,730
already been breached I think nowadays

864
00:35:34,730 --> 00:35:36,980
that conversation is definitely becoming

865
00:35:36,980 --> 00:35:40,210
easier just by merit of the fact that

866
00:35:40,210 --> 00:35:43,970
security breaches large-scale security

867
00:35:43,970 --> 00:35:46,340
breaches have happened to many big big

868
00:35:46,340 --> 00:35:48,290
name companies out there and it's all

869
00:35:48,290 --> 00:35:50,990
hit a lot of it's hit the media and you

870
00:35:50,990 --> 00:35:53,030
know executives and leadership can see

871
00:35:53,030 --> 00:35:55,400
you know the negative impact that has

872
00:35:55,400 --> 00:35:56,840
whether it's in terms of your share

873
00:35:56,840 --> 00:36:01,010
price or your customer confidence etc so

874
00:36:01,010 --> 00:36:03,260
I don't think it's as a harder

875
00:36:03,260 --> 00:36:05,570
discussion as it used to be but I

876
00:36:05,570 --> 00:36:07,640
definitely think specifically for

877
00:36:07,640 --> 00:36:10,760
security operations you as I was talking

878
00:36:10,760 --> 00:36:12,740
about in the use cases and again this

879
00:36:12,740 --> 00:36:14,300
might be a little bit too in-depth for

880
00:36:14,300 --> 00:36:17,420
high level leadership but certainly

881
00:36:17,420 --> 00:36:21,260
using real-world cases and illustrating

882
00:36:21,260 --> 00:36:23,000
what's happened in terms of you know the

883
00:36:23,000 --> 00:36:25,040
loss of revenue or the loss of customer

884
00:36:25,040 --> 00:36:27,920
confidence etc is really really helpful

885
00:36:27,920 --> 00:36:32,360
but also just you know explaining it can

886
00:36:32,360 --> 00:36:33,740
it's always difficult when it's

887
00:36:33,740 --> 00:36:35,180
leadership but I think always going back

888
00:36:35,180 --> 00:36:37,430
to that reputational you know ultimately

889
00:36:37,430 --> 00:36:40,130
businesses exist you most organizations

890
00:36:40,130 --> 00:36:43,220
exist to what commercial organizations

891
00:36:43,220 --> 00:36:45,650
exist to make make money made me feel

892
00:36:45,650 --> 00:36:48,260
government you know obviously you don't

893
00:36:48,260 --> 00:36:50,720
want you need the public to trust you so

894
00:36:50,720 --> 00:36:53,330
I think it's an it's an easier

895
00:36:53,330 --> 00:36:55,400
conversation than it was but I think

896
00:36:55,400 --> 00:36:59,330
certainly showing and an interesting one

897
00:36:59,330 --> 00:37:02,780
now is looking at the some companies not

898
00:37:02,780 --> 00:37:05,600
all I'm now being more open about their

899
00:37:05,600 --> 00:37:10,160
breaches Microsoft share Microsoft work

900
00:37:10,160 --> 00:37:11,870
with a company in Scandinavia they were

901
00:37:11,870 --> 00:37:12,530
very Oh

902
00:37:12,530 --> 00:37:15,410
about a breach that happened and we help

903
00:37:15,410 --> 00:37:18,530
them resolve that this is all public and

904
00:37:18,530 --> 00:37:20,870
I think like helping leadership see

905
00:37:20,870 --> 00:37:23,630
those and see all the effort that goes

906
00:37:23,630 --> 00:37:26,390
into having to remediate it in terms of

907
00:37:26,390 --> 00:37:28,760
the time the money is a good way to

908
00:37:28,760 --> 00:37:31,190
position saying hey we should try and

909
00:37:31,190 --> 00:37:33,260
stop this happening in the first place

910
00:37:33,260 --> 00:37:35,570
or at least minimize it which is why we

911
00:37:35,570 --> 00:37:38,300
need to invest in our which is why we

912
00:37:38,300 --> 00:37:39,350
need to invest in our security

913
00:37:39,350 --> 00:37:41,090
operations and there are definitely

914
00:37:41,090 --> 00:37:42,830
other companies out there it's still not

915
00:37:42,830 --> 00:37:43,400
the norm

916
00:37:43,400 --> 00:37:45,230
I'm hoping it will become more normal

917
00:37:45,230 --> 00:37:47,780
the companies who have been completely

918
00:37:47,780 --> 00:37:50,540
owned are actually being sharing their

919
00:37:50,540 --> 00:37:52,040
stories publicly and being much more

920
00:37:52,040 --> 00:37:54,740
open and I think that'll be great if

921
00:37:54,740 --> 00:37:57,920
that continues because it's really it's

922
00:37:57,920 --> 00:38:00,110
it's gonna help people realize how

923
00:38:00,110 --> 00:38:01,670
prevalent this is because of course at

924
00:38:01,670 --> 00:38:03,710
the moment if you get breached a lot of

925
00:38:03,710 --> 00:38:05,120
businesses and organizations don't

926
00:38:05,120 --> 00:38:07,430
really want to talk about it so some

927
00:38:07,430 --> 00:38:10,250
leadership will still think it's not a

928
00:38:10,250 --> 00:38:12,470
problem I think we largely got past the

929
00:38:12,470 --> 00:38:14,720
this won't happen to us mentality but

930
00:38:14,720 --> 00:38:16,100
maybe not quite yet

931
00:38:16,100 --> 00:38:19,430
that was a very long answer so that's

932
00:38:19,430 --> 00:38:21,350
alright so we had another question comes

933
00:38:21,350 --> 00:38:25,100
from Taj Taj s how can you go about

934
00:38:25,100 --> 00:38:32,630
making a decision on what to log I had a

935
00:38:32,630 --> 00:38:35,570
dollar every time people ask me that

936
00:38:35,570 --> 00:38:39,470
it's really difficult right and it's you

937
00:38:39,470 --> 00:38:41,480
know that and this is why there is no

938
00:38:41,480 --> 00:38:45,200
one there's no one like definitive

939
00:38:45,200 --> 00:38:46,850
source that says if you log all of these

940
00:38:46,850 --> 00:38:48,890
things you'll be fine because it's

941
00:38:48,890 --> 00:38:51,560
impossible to create that because each

942
00:38:51,560 --> 00:38:53,890
businesses business has different things

943
00:38:53,890 --> 00:38:57,220
what I would recommend you do is

944
00:38:57,220 --> 00:39:00,140
particularly if you're using cloud all

945
00:39:00,140 --> 00:39:03,020
of your infrastructure providers will

946
00:39:03,020 --> 00:39:04,970
often give you guidance about the kind

947
00:39:04,970 --> 00:39:07,070
of things you should lock they you know

948
00:39:07,070 --> 00:39:08,870
they say maybe as a bare minimum we'd

949
00:39:08,870 --> 00:39:11,720
start with this certainly I know no

950
00:39:11,720 --> 00:39:13,610
vendor is gonna give you like again

951
00:39:13,610 --> 00:39:14,900
they're not going to categorically say

952
00:39:14,900 --> 00:39:16,820
you must do this don't bother doing this

953
00:39:16,820 --> 00:39:19,130
no one will will ever do that because

954
00:39:19,130 --> 00:39:21,920
they can't but certainly you know take

955
00:39:21,920 --> 00:39:24,740
recommendations from who

956
00:39:24,740 --> 00:39:26,330
you know your vendors for your tools

957
00:39:26,330 --> 00:39:29,000
your infrastructure your platforms but

958
00:39:29,000 --> 00:39:31,130
then again and then I would say go back

959
00:39:31,130 --> 00:39:33,410
to your use cases you know what are the

960
00:39:33,410 --> 00:39:36,530
biggest threats in your organization or

961
00:39:36,530 --> 00:39:38,540
what does your organization consider the

962
00:39:38,540 --> 00:39:41,420
biggest risks and from that you can say

963
00:39:41,420 --> 00:39:44,630
okay so you know we it might be you have

964
00:39:44,630 --> 00:39:47,510
like 10 critical applications so for

965
00:39:47,510 --> 00:39:49,550
those 10 critical applications you might

966
00:39:49,550 --> 00:39:51,610
want to log everything they do

967
00:39:51,610 --> 00:39:53,900
everything because they are so critical

968
00:39:53,900 --> 00:39:55,580
whereas for other ones you might not

969
00:39:55,580 --> 00:39:58,940
need to be so prescriptive but yeah it's

970
00:39:58,940 --> 00:40:00,830
it's a really difficult time-consuming

971
00:40:00,830 --> 00:40:04,760
process and I I don't I think it's one

972
00:40:04,760 --> 00:40:06,890
of those things that businesses you know

973
00:40:06,890 --> 00:40:08,540
struggle with because it's

974
00:40:08,540 --> 00:40:10,160
time-consuming and you need to

975
00:40:10,160 --> 00:40:11,630
understand the business and everything's

976
00:40:11,630 --> 00:40:13,760
changing so I think you know again

977
00:40:13,760 --> 00:40:16,280
cheesy I know but it's a journey but I

978
00:40:16,280 --> 00:40:17,990
think taking those bare minimums

979
00:40:17,990 --> 00:40:19,760
recommendations from your vendors and

980
00:40:19,760 --> 00:40:22,550
then talking to your technology risk

981
00:40:22,550 --> 00:40:24,920
people and doing that threat modeling

982
00:40:24,920 --> 00:40:26,810
and understanding you know what would

983
00:40:26,810 --> 00:40:29,540
have the biggest impact if this you know

984
00:40:29,540 --> 00:40:31,810
if this part of the enterprise got owned

985
00:40:31,810 --> 00:40:34,970
what you know which part would have the

986
00:40:34,970 --> 00:40:36,890
most impact on the business negatively

987
00:40:36,890 --> 00:40:38,420
you know maybe you want to prioritize

988
00:40:38,420 --> 00:40:40,880
that I think that's the best way to go

989
00:40:40,880 --> 00:40:42,410
about it but it's certainly very

990
00:40:42,410 --> 00:40:46,040
challenging I know ok well thank you sir

991
00:40:46,040 --> 00:40:47,450
unfortunates all the time we have

992
00:40:47,450 --> 00:40:49,250
there's a few more questions that people

993
00:40:49,250 --> 00:40:50,450
were asking I don't know if you have a

994
00:40:50,450 --> 00:40:54,939
chance to pop in the chat after this man

995
00:40:55,090 --> 00:40:57,470
otherwise hopefully they can find you on

996
00:40:57,470 --> 00:40:59,960

997
