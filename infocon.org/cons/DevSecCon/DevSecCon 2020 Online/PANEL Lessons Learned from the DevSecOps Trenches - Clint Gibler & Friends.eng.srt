12
00:00:35,250 --> 00:00:37,110
time answering questions from you all

13
00:00:37,110 --> 00:00:40,649

00:02:22,120 --> 00:02:25,930
side of things as well very cool and

company called r2c we're building sort

53
00:02:32,230 --> 00:02:33,700
of a lightweight static analysis tool

54
00:02:33,700 --> 00:02:35,890
that hopefully you won't be unlike many

55
00:02:35,890 --> 00:02:39,040
other tools and we've had previous

56
00:02:39,040 --> 00:02:41,079
panels and people are negatively about

57
00:02:41,079 --> 00:02:50,349
them yeah but before this I was a

58
00:02:50,349 --> 00:02:52,329
research director and technical director

59
00:02:52,329 --> 00:02:54,280
at NCC group doing pen testing of all

60
00:02:54,280 --> 00:02:55,680
the things but also helping companies

61
00:02:55,680 --> 00:02:58,390
scale security and tech not security

62
00:02:58,390 --> 00:03:00,489
automation things like that I also have

63
00:03:00,489 --> 00:03:03,790
a newsletter TL DR SEC comm where I read

64
00:03:03,790 --> 00:03:05,200
a bunch of things and condense the best

65
00:03:05,200 --> 00:03:08,230
stuff down in one place oh yeah so let's

66
00:03:08,230 --> 00:03:12,810
get started so one thing that I think

67
00:03:12,810 --> 00:03:15,930
many people will have challenges with is

68
00:03:15,930 --> 00:03:18,280
you know in every organization there's

69
00:03:18,280 --> 00:03:20,109
many things you could do right there's

70
00:03:20,109 --> 00:03:21,880
tens of things that seem like a

71
00:03:21,880 --> 00:03:23,560
reasonable use of time and so I was

72
00:03:23,560 --> 00:03:25,810
curious for you all when you're

73
00:03:25,810 --> 00:03:29,650
orienting in an organization like what's

74
00:03:29,650 --> 00:03:30,879
your sort of thought process or a

75
00:03:30,879 --> 00:03:32,919
methodology for determining you know of

76
00:03:32,919 --> 00:03:34,540
the 50 things we can do what are maybe

77
00:03:34,540 --> 00:03:36,639
like the top view that makes sense to do

78
00:03:36,639 --> 00:03:40,690
first and and also what's your criteria

79
00:03:40,690 --> 00:03:42,549
for selecting if you want to do that or

80
00:03:42,549 --> 00:03:43,900
maybe it's like almost always we should

81
00:03:43,900 --> 00:03:45,669
do this yeah pretty open-ended

82
00:03:45,669 --> 00:03:48,220
I don't know how we're supposed to

83
00:03:48,220 --> 00:03:50,019
decide who starts confusion Iliana

84
00:03:50,019 --> 00:03:52,840
there's less eight others just kind of

85
00:03:52,840 --> 00:03:54,579
like shake your like I have the mic it's

86
00:03:54,579 --> 00:03:58,449
my turn yeah time yeah you start I'll

87
00:03:58,449 --> 00:04:01,060
try to handoff and I guess use your eyes

88
00:04:01,060 --> 00:04:03,480
to be like I have something to say and

89
00:04:03,480 --> 00:04:10,150
do this yeah if you can smize the nasa

90
00:04:10,150 --> 00:04:12,300
to you

91
00:04:12,300 --> 00:04:16,738
and so I usually start with I look at if

92
00:04:16,738 --> 00:04:18,720
they have policies and standards because

93
00:04:18,720 --> 00:04:20,220
if they don't have any guidance

94
00:04:20,220 --> 00:04:21,329
whatsoever

95
00:04:21,329 --> 00:04:23,790
or for developers then that's probably a

96
00:04:23,790 --> 00:04:26,130
problem and then I also try to get a

97
00:04:26,130 --> 00:04:28,560
copy of all of the previous tests that

98
00:04:28,560 --> 00:04:30,990
they've done forever how long with

99
00:04:30,990 --> 00:04:32,970
however many tools and then I crunch all

100
00:04:32,970 --> 00:04:37,500
the data because I enjoy that and then I

101
00:04:37,500 --> 00:04:40,620
make like a top-three of bad stuff and

102
00:04:40,620 --> 00:04:44,040
then we try I do knock that bad stuff

103
00:04:44,040 --> 00:04:47,340
and and start measuring metrics in a

104
00:04:47,340 --> 00:04:49,320
better more effective way see what's

105
00:04:49,320 --> 00:04:51,600
working so it's like let's show my value

106
00:04:51,600 --> 00:04:52,950
immediately by trying to knock down

107
00:04:52,950 --> 00:04:55,710
these three things and two of the three

108
00:04:55,710 --> 00:04:57,600
things are always lots of cross-site

109
00:04:57,600 --> 00:04:59,520
scripting and everyone is allergic to

110
00:04:59,520 --> 00:05:01,860
security headers you can even probably

111
00:05:01,860 --> 00:05:05,600
just start with that almost anywhere and

112
00:05:05,600 --> 00:05:08,370
work from there but yeah like I want to

113
00:05:08,370 --> 00:05:10,380
get metrics I want to have some sort of

114
00:05:10,380 --> 00:05:13,170
policy of some sort and then just top

115
00:05:13,170 --> 00:05:17,640
three nice I like it a lot you know it

116
00:05:17,640 --> 00:05:25,770
doesn't what are you so I like to or you

117
00:05:25,770 --> 00:05:27,300
know I was kind of recommend like just

118
00:05:27,300 --> 00:05:28,440
hearts and minds talk with people

119
00:05:28,440 --> 00:05:31,050
raising awareness in a you know as

120
00:05:31,050 --> 00:05:33,270
general away as possible all right so

121
00:05:33,270 --> 00:05:36,630
talk to you know talk to high level of

122
00:05:36,630 --> 00:05:38,610
folks VP's directors team leads as well

123
00:05:38,610 --> 00:05:40,320
as low level folks you know I sees

124
00:05:40,320 --> 00:05:41,940
interns you know whatever the case may

125
00:05:41,940 --> 00:05:42,960
be you just try to get a good

126
00:05:42,960 --> 00:05:44,940
cross-section of the company or

127
00:05:44,940 --> 00:05:46,919
engineering as much as you can try to

128
00:05:46,919 --> 00:05:49,200
understand the culture as much as you

129
00:05:49,200 --> 00:05:51,150
can and then you know I kind of do you

130
00:05:51,150 --> 00:05:53,400
know try to find where you know what

131
00:05:53,400 --> 00:05:55,140
skeletons are in long posits and try to

132
00:05:55,140 --> 00:05:57,870
just prioritize based on what's what I

133
00:05:57,870 --> 00:05:59,490
think is going to get us first

134
00:05:59,490 --> 00:06:01,110
right like based on what those gaps are

135
00:06:01,110 --> 00:06:03,390
and then and then go forward depending

136
00:06:03,390 --> 00:06:05,550
on you know depending on the culture

137
00:06:05,550 --> 00:06:07,980
depending on the needs and the resources

138
00:06:07,980 --> 00:06:09,720
you have available like all those things

139
00:06:09,720 --> 00:06:13,620
playing in a very strange dynamic no

140
00:06:13,620 --> 00:06:15,960
matter where you are so I think it's

141
00:06:15,960 --> 00:06:17,730
it's you really have to kind of do your

142
00:06:17,730 --> 00:06:20,010
homework first and figure out what

143
00:06:20,010 --> 00:06:22,169
you're looking at and then ruthlessly

144
00:06:22,169 --> 00:06:24,090
prioritize and just keep chipping away

145
00:06:24,090 --> 00:06:25,980
at that list

146
00:06:25,980 --> 00:06:28,160
you have any tips on uncovering

147
00:06:28,160 --> 00:06:31,530
skeletons and closets I'm Carrie yeah

148
00:06:31,530 --> 00:06:33,300
honestly I think it's talking to people

149
00:06:33,300 --> 00:06:35,250
um that's one of the big like you know

150
00:06:35,250 --> 00:06:36,780
just that's the simple question like

151
00:06:36,780 --> 00:06:38,010
what's you know what keeps you up at

152
00:06:38,010 --> 00:06:39,600
night or what scares you the most right

153
00:06:39,600 --> 00:06:41,220
and if they've never you know if it's a

154
00:06:41,220 --> 00:06:42,660
newer company or a smaller company

155
00:06:42,660 --> 00:06:44,670
they'd never really like smoking too

156
00:06:44,670 --> 00:06:47,850
much - security folks a lot of people

157
00:06:47,850 --> 00:06:48,990
will have a lot of thoughts you know

158
00:06:48,990 --> 00:06:52,710
it's it's surprisingly so I find that to

159
00:06:52,710 --> 00:06:54,330
be very effective just doing interviews

160
00:06:54,330 --> 00:06:57,500
essentially when you first get there

161
00:06:57,620 --> 00:07:01,680
definitely yeah I would second let

162
00:07:01,680 --> 00:07:04,200
Justin go ahead thing no just go for it

163
00:07:04,200 --> 00:07:08,760
we can all we called you the eyes yeah I

164
00:07:08,760 --> 00:07:12,570
would I totally agree with and I think

165
00:07:12,570 --> 00:07:14,700
those things are really important and I

166
00:07:14,700 --> 00:07:17,430
think one of the things I like to start

167
00:07:17,430 --> 00:07:20,580
with is what is the sort of high-level

168
00:07:20,580 --> 00:07:22,740
threat model what are the things that we

169
00:07:22,740 --> 00:07:24,870
actually care about what would make us

170
00:07:24,870 --> 00:07:27,690
have a really bad day and then kind of

171
00:07:27,690 --> 00:07:30,210
drill down from there and say okay well

172
00:07:30,210 --> 00:07:32,010
we care about these things

173
00:07:32,010 --> 00:07:35,640
so let's go drill into what are the

174
00:07:35,640 --> 00:07:37,170
fundamentals around those things and

175
00:07:37,170 --> 00:07:38,910
what are the things that we could do to

176
00:07:38,910 --> 00:07:41,780
harden that up and I think

177
00:07:41,780 --> 00:07:43,920
prioritization is one of the hardest

178
00:07:43,920 --> 00:07:48,030
things and figuring out as soon as

179
00:07:48,030 --> 00:07:48,810
possible

180
00:07:48,810 --> 00:07:51,390
what is risky what you think is

181
00:07:51,390 --> 00:07:53,120
high-risk what you think is lower risk

182
00:07:53,120 --> 00:07:56,760
what you care about is really important

183
00:07:56,760 --> 00:08:01,830
to get started yeah absolutely

184
00:08:01,830 --> 00:08:03,900
I can round it out here I'm just gonna

185
00:08:03,900 --> 00:08:05,610
building off of what everybody said I

186
00:08:05,610 --> 00:08:07,620
think you know regardless of whether

187
00:08:07,620 --> 00:08:10,470
you're coming into a big established

188
00:08:10,470 --> 00:08:12,300
security program already or whether

189
00:08:12,300 --> 00:08:13,860
you're the first security hire or

190
00:08:13,860 --> 00:08:16,170
whether you're a consultant being asked

191
00:08:16,170 --> 00:08:17,580
to give your opinion on a security

192
00:08:17,580 --> 00:08:20,550
program I think a lot of the first steps

193
00:08:20,550 --> 00:08:22,770
that folks have really found to be

194
00:08:22,770 --> 00:08:24,720
successful and I know I have in my past

195
00:08:24,720 --> 00:08:27,390
is you know talking with the rest of

196
00:08:27,390 --> 00:08:29,400
leadership whether that's technical

197
00:08:29,400 --> 00:08:30,900
leadership or business leadership and

198
00:08:30,900 --> 00:08:33,000
saying like look I'm sure you have had

199
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:34,710
negative experiences with security in

200
00:08:34,710 --> 00:08:38,070
the past this is the style of security

201
00:08:38,070 --> 00:08:39,309
program that we want to

202
00:08:39,309 --> 00:08:41,469
here or what will make security

203
00:08:41,469 --> 00:08:44,290
effective here is if security is here to

204
00:08:44,290 --> 00:08:46,270
help enable the business actually

205
00:08:46,270 --> 00:08:47,950
deliver on what it wants to deliver on

206
00:08:47,950 --> 00:08:50,680
so you know that is kind of the top

207
00:08:50,680 --> 00:08:53,950
level goal of security and really having

208
00:08:53,950 --> 00:08:55,570
that communication from the beginning so

209
00:08:55,570 --> 00:08:58,060
then you can go have all of these great

210
00:08:58,060 --> 00:09:00,100
different pieces that Justine and Tanja

211
00:09:00,100 --> 00:09:01,990
and Doug mentioned of where are the

212
00:09:01,990 --> 00:09:03,430
skeletons in the closet what are you

213
00:09:03,430 --> 00:09:05,740
what is your organizational threat model

214
00:09:05,740 --> 00:09:07,060
that's keeping you up at night what are

215
00:09:07,060 --> 00:09:09,760
you thinking about from a app or API

216
00:09:09,760 --> 00:09:12,370
wine perspective but starting from that

217
00:09:12,370 --> 00:09:15,160
real place of saying look if security is

218
00:09:15,160 --> 00:09:16,660
going to be successful it's got to

219
00:09:16,660 --> 00:09:18,940
enable everybody to move at the speed

220
00:09:18,940 --> 00:09:20,710
that they want to move otherwise it just

221
00:09:20,710 --> 00:09:25,150
gets routed around yeah totally I I like

222
00:09:25,150 --> 00:09:26,860
that a lot and I hear that again and

223
00:09:26,860 --> 00:09:28,540
again from many people at different

224
00:09:28,540 --> 00:09:30,010
companies who have sort of

225
00:09:30,010 --> 00:09:31,510
forward-thinking security programs where

226
00:09:31,510 --> 00:09:32,680
I think there's been this strategic

227
00:09:32,680 --> 00:09:35,110
shift from security being the the

228
00:09:35,110 --> 00:09:36,940
gatekeepers and the naysayers to being

229
00:09:36,940 --> 00:09:38,470
like ok how do we empower people how do

230
00:09:38,470 --> 00:09:40,300
we enable the business and I've heard

231
00:09:40,300 --> 00:09:42,910
this theme from a bunch of other talks

232
00:09:42,910 --> 00:09:45,280
today so it's nice to see you sort of as

233
00:09:45,280 --> 00:09:46,360
an industry about like oh we should

234
00:09:46,360 --> 00:09:51,190
maybe be more likable all the time

235
00:09:51,190 --> 00:09:52,780
people actually ask you on how to

236
00:09:52,780 --> 00:09:54,580
improve that it's amazing everything

237
00:09:54,580 --> 00:10:00,790
it's crazy it's a human psychology so

238
00:10:00,790 --> 00:10:04,030
actually a one thing that a time you

239
00:10:04,030 --> 00:10:05,200
said before that I thought would be

240
00:10:05,200 --> 00:10:08,800
interesting to come back to is this idea

241
00:10:08,800 --> 00:10:10,570
of like eliminating classes of

242
00:10:10,570 --> 00:10:12,610
vulnerabilities so I think it's easy to

243
00:10:12,610 --> 00:10:14,950
sort of get into this you know Rackham

244
00:10:14,950 --> 00:10:18,070
ol state where you're just like find a

245
00:10:18,070 --> 00:10:19,930
bug fix it find a bug fix it but that's

246
00:10:19,930 --> 00:10:21,580
not really scalable there's many more

247
00:10:21,580 --> 00:10:24,820
people writing code and you know small

248
00:10:24,820 --> 00:10:26,830
team trying to defend it so I'm curious

249
00:10:26,830 --> 00:10:29,110
if any of you could share an example of

250
00:10:29,110 --> 00:10:32,140
like a a vulnerability class that you

251
00:10:32,140 --> 00:10:34,780
eliminated at a company or sort of how

252
00:10:34,780 --> 00:10:36,520
you were able to sort of like

253
00:10:36,520 --> 00:10:38,290
systematically raise the security bar

254
00:10:38,290 --> 00:10:40,150
either by eliminating a vulnerability

255
00:10:40,150 --> 00:10:41,770
class or just something that's better

256
00:10:41,770 --> 00:10:47,080
than sort of a point in time fix yeah I

257
00:10:47,080 --> 00:10:48,910
think I saw some slightly widened eyes

258
00:10:48,910 --> 00:10:52,290
from the Narnia

259
00:10:52,480 --> 00:10:55,850
I wanted to give other people a chance

260
00:10:55,850 --> 00:10:57,680
but then I also wanted to make fun of

261
00:10:57,680 --> 00:11:01,510
myself so it was like a hard call there

262
00:11:02,500 --> 00:11:05,029
so I've worked at two places where we

263
00:11:05,029 --> 00:11:08,660
chose a specific vulnerability cost one

264
00:11:08,660 --> 00:11:10,130
was cross-site scripting and one was

265
00:11:10,130 --> 00:11:12,380
like injection as a whole and I know

266
00:11:12,380 --> 00:11:14,029
that like cross-site scripting sort of

267
00:11:14,029 --> 00:11:15,950
like its type of injection but I feel

268
00:11:15,950 --> 00:11:17,900
it's special because it's in the browser

269
00:11:17,900 --> 00:11:20,839
and just so popular it's just a popular

270
00:11:20,839 --> 00:11:24,920
thing for us to code and so one of the

271
00:11:24,920 --> 00:11:27,110
things we did was we created like a deep

272
00:11:27,110 --> 00:11:31,190
dive like a bunch and learn you know

273
00:11:31,190 --> 00:11:32,720
back when you could be in the same room

274
00:11:32,720 --> 00:11:36,080
as another human and you know I taught

275
00:11:36,080 --> 00:11:38,089
all the dads but then we recorded it and

276
00:11:38,089 --> 00:11:40,400
it was about like what the actual risk

277
00:11:40,400 --> 00:11:42,290
is so turned out a lot of the devs

278
00:11:42,290 --> 00:11:44,930
thought cross-site scripting is actually

279
00:11:44,930 --> 00:11:47,180
just pop-up boxes and it just makes your

280
00:11:47,180 --> 00:11:49,520
app look silly and so when I explained

281
00:11:49,520 --> 00:11:51,560
the actual things you could do with

282
00:11:51,560 --> 00:11:54,050
cross-site scripting and also stuff I

283
00:11:54,050 --> 00:11:57,140
had done to their apps with it there oh

284
00:11:57,140 --> 00:12:00,770
that seems really bad and then explained

285
00:12:00,770 --> 00:12:02,150
how to find it and how they could

286
00:12:02,150 --> 00:12:05,780
totally find it and bust it and then

287
00:12:05,780 --> 00:12:08,210
explains like now let's make unit test

288
00:12:08,210 --> 00:12:10,700
so that never comes back and like we

289
00:12:10,700 --> 00:12:12,770
made kind of a game out of it and like

290
00:12:12,770 --> 00:12:15,290
oh I crushed this and high-fives and

291
00:12:15,290 --> 00:12:18,710
other things and then start testing for

292
00:12:18,710 --> 00:12:20,330
it right

293
00:12:20,330 --> 00:12:22,820
I'm sorry reinforcing mine like if you

294
00:12:22,820 --> 00:12:24,650
did find it we're gonna make a unit test

295
00:12:24,650 --> 00:12:26,000
to make sure it doesn't accidentally

296
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:28,610
tumble back in and I found like

297
00:12:28,610 --> 00:12:30,710
supporting them with code samples

298
00:12:30,710 --> 00:12:34,700
supporting them with like a wasp creates

299
00:12:34,700 --> 00:12:37,070
this cross-site scripting filter or

300
00:12:37,070 --> 00:12:39,380
evasion cheat sheet so I gave that to

301
00:12:39,380 --> 00:12:41,810
them and showed them how to go test for

302
00:12:41,810 --> 00:12:43,430
it and what to look for in the code and

303
00:12:43,430 --> 00:12:46,160
so then they're like we got this Tanya

304
00:12:46,160 --> 00:12:49,640
what's next right and kind of enabled

305
00:12:49,640 --> 00:12:50,630
them if that makes sense

306
00:12:50,630 --> 00:12:53,360
I also gave them scanners like Zak and

307
00:12:53,360 --> 00:12:55,610
that's not perfect right like if you

308
00:12:55,610 --> 00:12:57,320
have someone like a developer that's not

309
00:12:57,320 --> 00:13:00,980
super security they haven't done a lot

310
00:13:00,980 --> 00:13:02,450
of security testing that's not their job

311
00:13:02,450 --> 00:13:03,699
but they could still find

312
00:13:03,699 --> 00:13:05,410
stuff with it and I found they did pick

313
00:13:05,410 --> 00:13:07,509
up a bit of it and then that meant it

314
00:13:07,509 --> 00:13:09,369
was work I didn't have to do and I liked

315
00:13:09,369 --> 00:13:11,100
that

316
00:13:11,100 --> 00:13:13,419
so those are some of the things I've

317
00:13:13,419 --> 00:13:14,709
done but I would love to hear what

318
00:13:14,709 --> 00:13:16,689
everyone else has done because I'd

319
00:13:16,689 --> 00:13:18,730
secretly rag down earlier know so I can

320
00:13:18,730 --> 00:13:24,009
look smarter I can I can talk to an out

321
00:13:24,009 --> 00:13:27,910
there on just the less of the how and

322
00:13:27,910 --> 00:13:29,649
more of kind of what this actually gives

323
00:13:29,649 --> 00:13:31,239
you which is when you start to think

324
00:13:31,239 --> 00:13:33,309
about eliminating phone classes the the

325
00:13:33,309 --> 00:13:36,069
way that that I've always done this at

326
00:13:36,069 --> 00:13:37,359
scale and that I've seen this done at

327
00:13:37,359 --> 00:13:40,419
scale is really you focus on for

328
00:13:40,419 --> 00:13:41,829
whatever some of the common frameworks

329
00:13:41,829 --> 00:13:44,019
that your engineering teams are using

330
00:13:44,019 --> 00:13:46,509
whatever you find the the safe ways to

331
00:13:46,509 --> 00:13:48,160
do that and you make that the default

332
00:13:48,160 --> 00:13:50,709
inside the framework so that then what

333
00:13:50,709 --> 00:13:52,660
you've what you find is okay if we make

334
00:13:52,660 --> 00:13:53,889
this a default it doesn't mean people

335
00:13:53,889 --> 00:13:56,109
will never opt out of the default but it

336
00:13:56,109 --> 00:13:57,819
means now and we're gonna go do code

337
00:13:57,819 --> 00:14:00,399
review or deep dive into something we're

338
00:14:00,399 --> 00:14:02,889
only kind of grepping in on the areas

339
00:14:02,889 --> 00:14:06,009
where there's somebody actually opting

340
00:14:06,009 --> 00:14:08,319
out of the built-in protections and it

341
00:14:08,319 --> 00:14:10,329
means in practice it means once you

342
00:14:10,329 --> 00:14:11,829
first turn the sort of stuff on it means

343
00:14:11,829 --> 00:14:13,239
you've got a huge backlog of things to

344
00:14:13,239 --> 00:14:15,699
go take a look at in the past but you've

345
00:14:15,699 --> 00:14:17,649
kind of you're stopping the bleeding and

346
00:14:17,649 --> 00:14:17,980
yep

347
00:14:17,980 --> 00:14:20,619
going forward it means the amount of

348
00:14:20,619 --> 00:14:22,749
things that you need to review it drops

349
00:14:22,749 --> 00:14:24,579
by orders of magnitude because now you

350
00:14:24,579 --> 00:14:26,079
can just look for people opting out of

351
00:14:26,079 --> 00:14:28,089
the default and you call it you call it

352
00:14:28,089 --> 00:14:29,889
very when they're up beyond the default

353
00:14:29,889 --> 00:14:33,100
you call it very obvious things like

354
00:14:33,100 --> 00:14:36,220
unsafely handle user input in all caps

355
00:14:36,220 --> 00:14:38,799
so hey it's real easy to grab for and be

356
00:14:38,799 --> 00:14:40,209
people know what they're doing is not

357
00:14:40,209 --> 00:14:41,619
just all me a turn off this one thing

358
00:14:41,619 --> 00:14:44,499
but put entire system in danger by

359
00:14:44,499 --> 00:14:46,779
handling this wrong when you call that

360
00:14:46,779 --> 00:14:48,519
function you know that you're putting

361
00:14:48,519 --> 00:14:49,929
the entire system in danger

362
00:14:49,929 --> 00:14:55,230
dangerously insecure it's yes exactly I

363
00:14:55,230 --> 00:14:57,789
will be paying the bug bounty out of my

364
00:14:57,789 --> 00:15:05,139
salary yeah one thing I really like

365
00:15:05,139 --> 00:15:07,929
about that approach is it sort of flips

366
00:15:07,929 --> 00:15:09,910
the concept on its head from doing very

367
00:15:09,910 --> 00:15:13,360
sort of like complicated and potentially

368
00:15:13,360 --> 00:15:15,639
time and resource intensive analysis to

369
00:15:15,639 --> 00:15:17,230
something that's much more simple it's

370
00:15:17,230 --> 00:15:17,600
basic

371
00:15:17,600 --> 00:15:19,399
like you're not doing crazy

372
00:15:19,399 --> 00:15:21,019
interprocedural data flow analysis

373
00:15:21,019 --> 00:15:23,569
you're just like hey I know that this is

374
00:15:23,569 --> 00:15:25,100
secure so are you doing the thing I

375
00:15:25,100 --> 00:15:26,990
expect you to like are you rolling your

376
00:15:26,990 --> 00:15:28,730
own crypto versus using the crypto that

377
00:15:28,730 --> 00:15:30,740
we gave you because you should probably

378
00:15:30,740 --> 00:15:32,509
just build use the nice things we gave

379
00:15:32,509 --> 00:15:35,420
you and don't opt out of it and that's

380
00:15:35,420 --> 00:15:36,980
just computationally much easier fishing

381
00:15:36,980 --> 00:15:40,040
for it yeah it's easier to automate to

382
00:15:40,040 --> 00:15:42,319
write and then you it then like that

383
00:15:42,319 --> 00:15:45,079
whole process becomes automated right

384
00:15:45,079 --> 00:15:46,639
it's much less work for anybody like

385
00:15:46,639 --> 00:15:49,160
tanya was saying you know and that it

386
00:15:49,160 --> 00:15:51,019
kind of just solves itself I don't know

387
00:15:51,019 --> 00:15:52,940
what with with a minimal amount of work

388
00:15:52,940 --> 00:15:58,490
upfront work yeah totally any final

389
00:15:58,490 --> 00:15:59,600
thing you want a time in China

390
00:15:59,600 --> 00:16:02,870
interesting just that I mean I

391
00:16:02,870 --> 00:16:04,990
completely agree and I think that this

392
00:16:04,990 --> 00:16:07,160
focusing on classes and vulnerabilities

393
00:16:07,160 --> 00:16:10,819
is a great way to go and one of the

394
00:16:10,819 --> 00:16:13,190
other side benefits is that it lets your

395
00:16:13,190 --> 00:16:16,009
security team have some wins like it it

396
00:16:16,009 --> 00:16:18,139
can be hard to find wins and when you

397
00:16:18,139 --> 00:16:20,509
can actually say look we did it we kill

398
00:16:20,509 --> 00:16:22,279
the class of owner abilities that is a

399
00:16:22,279 --> 00:16:29,569
great feeling yeah totally yeah actually

400
00:16:29,569 --> 00:16:32,329
a Justine one thing I was curious about

401
00:16:32,329 --> 00:16:34,939
is um so in your red team role often

402
00:16:34,939 --> 00:16:37,279
times you're communicating with managing

403
00:16:37,279 --> 00:16:39,019
Mainer Schmidt and upper leadership then

404
00:16:39,019 --> 00:16:41,300
based on my conversations with a couple

405
00:16:41,300 --> 00:16:44,209
of different companies they one trend

406
00:16:44,209 --> 00:16:45,560
depending on the culture of the company

407
00:16:45,560 --> 00:16:47,899
is that it can be difficult to get

408
00:16:47,899 --> 00:16:49,819
leadership buy-in and to sort of bigger

409
00:16:49,819 --> 00:16:51,769
security efforts like hey like this is

410
00:16:51,769 --> 00:16:54,050
gonna pay off a hugely long term but we

411
00:16:54,050 --> 00:16:55,490
need like a couple of months to work on

412
00:16:55,490 --> 00:16:58,040
it or maybe longer so curious if you

413
00:16:58,040 --> 00:17:00,290
have any like tips and strategies when

414
00:17:00,290 --> 00:17:01,310
you're trying to get buy-in from

415
00:17:01,310 --> 00:17:03,380
leadership or perhaps even just

416
00:17:03,380 --> 00:17:04,789
explaining the importance of certain

417
00:17:04,789 --> 00:17:08,419
security things because they're do

418
00:17:08,419 --> 00:17:09,650
people can talk with other security

419
00:17:09,650 --> 00:17:12,380
people but that's not our job in

420
00:17:12,380 --> 00:17:14,720
isolation so yeah I'm curious uh cuz you

421
00:17:14,720 --> 00:17:16,970
do that a lot in your room yeah yeah I

422
00:17:16,970 --> 00:17:19,039
mean I think there are lots of lots of

423
00:17:19,039 --> 00:17:21,919
different aspects to it I think one of

424
00:17:21,919 --> 00:17:23,809
the ways that I see offensive security

425
00:17:23,809 --> 00:17:28,450
being very very useful is to encourage

426
00:17:28,450 --> 00:17:31,400
the behaviors that we're looking for or

427
00:17:31,400 --> 00:17:34,850
to better articulate the risks that were

428
00:17:34,850 --> 00:17:37,850
seeing and just like tanya was saying

429
00:17:37,850 --> 00:17:40,430
when you go and actually show someone an

430
00:17:40,430 --> 00:17:43,400
exploit or really explain to them what

431
00:17:43,400 --> 00:17:45,920
can be done with a given vulnerability

432
00:17:45,920 --> 00:17:48,620
it changes everything the lights turn on

433
00:17:48,620 --> 00:17:51,500
and it's all of a sudden people are

434
00:17:51,500 --> 00:17:55,640
excited and and you know encouraged to

435
00:17:55,640 --> 00:17:58,790
see a reason to fix a lot of the things

436
00:17:58,790 --> 00:18:00,290
that you're sending their way and

437
00:18:00,290 --> 00:18:02,360
actually want to do that instead of

438
00:18:02,360 --> 00:18:04,490
feeling like it's just a hassle kind of

439
00:18:04,490 --> 00:18:06,590
minor thing it's gonna pop some alert

440
00:18:06,590 --> 00:18:08,420
box you don't understand why that's a

441
00:18:08,420 --> 00:18:11,690
problem and how it fits into the rest of

442
00:18:11,690 --> 00:18:13,730
the ecosystem I think that's another

443
00:18:13,730 --> 00:18:15,080
thing is that we often look at

444
00:18:15,080 --> 00:18:18,200
vulnerabilities in a very small scope we

445
00:18:18,200 --> 00:18:19,460
say there's a vulnerability in one

446
00:18:19,460 --> 00:18:21,920
application in one system in the company

447
00:18:21,920 --> 00:18:24,320
but if you look at it from the red team

448
00:18:24,320 --> 00:18:26,090
perspective you're often going towards a

449
00:18:26,090 --> 00:18:27,620
goal something that we really care about

450
00:18:27,620 --> 00:18:31,130
and you may use different

451
00:18:31,130 --> 00:18:32,210
vulnerabilities in different

452
00:18:32,210 --> 00:18:34,370
applications to get to that goal and it

453
00:18:34,370 --> 00:18:36,260
helps you understand why your

454
00:18:36,260 --> 00:18:38,390
application that may not do very much is

455
00:18:38,390 --> 00:18:40,130
actually still important to secure

456
00:18:40,130 --> 00:18:43,400
because it can be a stepping stone to

457
00:18:43,400 --> 00:18:45,380
other things that we really care about

458
00:18:45,380 --> 00:18:48,110
so I think it can really help articulate

459
00:18:48,110 --> 00:18:51,980
both to executives and to you know at

460
00:18:51,980 --> 00:18:53,960
general employees of the company the

461
00:18:53,960 --> 00:18:57,380
importance of security and then I think

462
00:18:57,380 --> 00:19:00,800
convincing executives that offensive

463
00:19:00,800 --> 00:19:02,390
security is something they should do is

464
00:19:02,390 --> 00:19:06,230
a whole different set of things you have

465
00:19:06,230 --> 00:19:08,000
to think about and a lot there it

466
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:10,100
depends on trust and being extremely

467
00:19:10,100 --> 00:19:16,250
trustworthy yeah definitely and along

468
00:19:16,250 --> 00:19:18,110
the they could value of different

469
00:19:18,110 --> 00:19:19,610
exploit chains I remember you gave an

470
00:19:19,610 --> 00:19:21,290
example once about how there was like a

471
00:19:21,290 --> 00:19:22,910
low severity issue in one app and then a

472
00:19:22,910 --> 00:19:24,290
low severity issue in another app and

473
00:19:24,290 --> 00:19:25,370
there were like three or four of those

474
00:19:25,370 --> 00:19:26,780
and but actually I can get to like

475
00:19:26,780 --> 00:19:28,550
sensitive user data because of this

476
00:19:28,550 --> 00:19:30,140
combination of things that in isolation

477
00:19:30,140 --> 00:19:32,840
you know we we feel is not that risky so

478
00:19:32,840 --> 00:19:35,000
I thought that was an acting lesson yeah

479
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:39,530
and yeah Zain did I see you about to say

480
00:19:39,530 --> 00:19:40,070
something

481
00:19:40,070 --> 00:19:42,050
oh this was the blinking twice for help

482
00:19:42,050 --> 00:19:43,780
I

483
00:19:43,780 --> 00:19:49,040
yes sorry no I I strongly agree with

484
00:19:49,040 --> 00:19:50,300
that right I think this is kind of the

485
00:19:50,300 --> 00:19:52,850
the interesting thing from offensive

486
00:19:52,850 --> 00:19:55,370
security side of things right is you you

487
00:19:55,370 --> 00:19:59,510
learn how in practice it's never it's

488
00:19:59,510 --> 00:20:01,490
very rarely just straight from point A

489
00:20:01,490 --> 00:20:03,200
to point B in terms of actually

490
00:20:03,200 --> 00:20:05,900
compromising real data inside of a real

491
00:20:05,900 --> 00:20:08,420
environment it's often point A to point

492
00:20:08,420 --> 00:20:11,510
s to point P to point s to eventually to

493
00:20:11,510 --> 00:20:14,240
point B or C and you're chaining

494
00:20:14,240 --> 00:20:16,700
together a million loads and mediums and

495
00:20:16,700 --> 00:20:19,340
occasional high that's on a internal

496
00:20:19,340 --> 00:20:22,550
system to eventually get to your actual

497
00:20:22,550 --> 00:20:24,890
target there and I think that that's why

498
00:20:24,890 --> 00:20:26,960
the two sides really complement each

499
00:20:26,960 --> 00:20:29,030
other so well and why the really high

500
00:20:29,030 --> 00:20:30,920
functioning security programs are the

501
00:20:30,920 --> 00:20:32,870
ones that use the - to constantly

502
00:20:32,870 --> 00:20:35,270
reinforce the other right as feedback

503
00:20:35,270 --> 00:20:37,190
loops for the other of hey we think we

504
00:20:37,190 --> 00:20:38,710
just wiped out this vulnerability class

505
00:20:38,710 --> 00:20:41,360
fantastic let's have our red team

506
00:20:41,360 --> 00:20:43,130
actually try to find some of those in

507
00:20:43,130 --> 00:20:44,510
areas where there might have been edge

508
00:20:44,510 --> 00:20:46,580
cases now let's use that to influence

509
00:20:46,580 --> 00:20:48,830
our blue team to say hey what alert

510
00:20:48,830 --> 00:20:50,870
popped up on our systems on our

511
00:20:50,870 --> 00:20:52,910
monitoring systems when someone actually

512
00:20:52,910 --> 00:20:54,620
found that and discovered it and you'll

513
00:20:54,620 --> 00:20:56,570
find along the way oh there are a

514
00:20:56,570 --> 00:20:58,250
million edge cases that didn't inherit

515
00:20:58,250 --> 00:21:00,140
that new framework you didn't actually

516
00:21:00,140 --> 00:21:01,880
have a bunch of alerts firing when

517
00:21:01,880 --> 00:21:03,470
somebody you know fountain when someone

518
00:21:03,470 --> 00:21:04,850
actually started exploiting something

519
00:21:04,850 --> 00:21:07,010
and it allows you feedback loops to

520
00:21:07,010 --> 00:21:10,160
really up level your security programs

521
00:21:10,160 --> 00:21:12,800
over time yep

522
00:21:12,800 --> 00:21:15,470
I actually very recently within the last

523
00:21:15,470 --> 00:21:18,440
week or so real life story about this we

524
00:21:18,440 --> 00:21:21,200
had our with a offensive team at data

525
00:21:21,200 --> 00:21:24,560
dog and we had we asked them to test one

526
00:21:24,560 --> 00:21:28,850
of our endpoint security you know it's

527
00:21:28,850 --> 00:21:29,750
not something that's currently rolled

528
00:21:29,750 --> 00:21:31,100
out but was something that we were kind

529
00:21:31,100 --> 00:21:32,870
of looking at and they identified a

530
00:21:32,870 --> 00:21:35,030
number of gaps and we understood like

531
00:21:35,030 --> 00:21:36,170
what they were doing you know like they

532
00:21:36,170 --> 00:21:37,610
kind of like they wrote down like almost

533
00:21:37,610 --> 00:21:39,410
almost stream-of-consciousness like what

534
00:21:39,410 --> 00:21:40,880
they were doing and how they were doing

535
00:21:40,880 --> 00:21:42,170
it and where the process is kind of

536
00:21:42,170 --> 00:21:44,330
writing up all three salts here but even

537
00:21:44,330 --> 00:21:46,070
like the preliminary results means we

538
00:21:46,070 --> 00:21:47,150
have to go back to the drawing board

539
00:21:47,150 --> 00:21:48,680
with our endpoint security solution

540
00:21:48,680 --> 00:21:50,240
right like because we know the fit like

541
00:21:50,240 --> 00:21:52,010
the gaps that they identified are just

542
00:21:52,010 --> 00:21:53,270
not going to be able to be handled by

543
00:21:53,270 --> 00:21:56,080
this piece of software so like it's just

544
00:21:56,080 --> 00:21:57,799
like you

545
00:21:57,799 --> 00:21:59,929
a lot more work for us but it's a great

546
00:21:59,929 --> 00:22:01,580
thing right like that's exactly what

547
00:22:01,580 --> 00:22:03,259
they what they should be doing and

548
00:22:03,259 --> 00:22:04,580
that's exactly the type of feedback that

549
00:22:04,580 --> 00:22:07,279
we need to you know our game and take it

550
00:22:07,279 --> 00:22:08,809
to the next level it's a really really

551
00:22:08,809 --> 00:22:10,309
great story when I when I heard that one

552
00:22:10,309 --> 00:22:12,259
of my Chaney's are just I'm so excited

553
00:22:12,259 --> 00:22:15,529
I'm like working this is great yeah I

554
00:22:15,529 --> 00:22:18,950
think that's that you both bring to

555
00:22:18,950 --> 00:22:21,200
light something that's super important

556
00:22:21,200 --> 00:22:22,820
for any offensive security teams out

557
00:22:22,820 --> 00:22:25,009
there is you really need to look at

558
00:22:25,009 --> 00:22:29,299
yourself as almost like you are a data

559
00:22:29,299 --> 00:22:31,460
information team and you're feeding that

560
00:22:31,460 --> 00:22:33,379
into all of these other teams of the

561
00:22:33,379 --> 00:22:37,039
company and there's many but you really

562
00:22:37,039 --> 00:22:38,509
need to look at yourself as that it's

563
00:22:38,509 --> 00:22:42,230
not just you know you sort of have a

564
00:22:42,230 --> 00:22:44,269
vulnerability that you provide but but

565
00:22:44,269 --> 00:22:45,799
there's tons of interesting data that

566
00:22:45,799 --> 00:22:48,230
you can gather from the attackers

567
00:22:48,230 --> 00:22:49,580
perspective that you can share with the

568
00:22:49,580 --> 00:22:54,950
rest of the company I like it I'm just

569
00:22:54,950 --> 00:22:56,720
like agreeing and nodding and being like

570
00:22:56,720 --> 00:23:01,940
all the things yes a great shame yeah

571
00:23:01,940 --> 00:23:04,789
did you wanna say anything Tania to add

572
00:23:04,789 --> 00:23:07,460
slightly to this once you have these

573
00:23:07,460 --> 00:23:09,559
other three brilliant people you have

574
00:23:09,559 --> 00:23:11,419
all of this information about things

575
00:23:11,419 --> 00:23:12,710
that are wrong if you're still having

576
00:23:12,710 --> 00:23:15,440
trouble getting management to sign off

577
00:23:15,440 --> 00:23:18,190
on fixing these things I like to sign a

578
00:23:18,190 --> 00:23:21,769
send them a risk acceptance document

579
00:23:21,769 --> 00:23:24,350
which is stuff I made up when I first

580
00:23:24,350 --> 00:23:26,359
started in InfoSec because no one would

581
00:23:26,359 --> 00:23:29,299
do anything so I said I can't I don't

582
00:23:29,299 --> 00:23:31,039
have the authority to sign off on this

583
00:23:31,039 --> 00:23:33,499
risk so I need you to sign it and then I

584
00:23:33,499 --> 00:23:35,720
just wrote basically all the things I

585
00:23:35,720 --> 00:23:37,340
just talked about like the real business

586
00:23:37,340 --> 00:23:39,409
things that could happen if we don't fix

587
00:23:39,409 --> 00:23:41,779
these things etc and then of course

588
00:23:41,779 --> 00:23:44,359
everyone ever refuses to sign that

589
00:23:44,359 --> 00:23:47,509
document and I'm like well then I guess

590
00:23:47,509 --> 00:23:48,799
you would need to give me those were you

591
00:23:48,799 --> 00:23:50,899
to fix these things because otherwise

592
00:23:50,899 --> 00:23:57,639
you are accepting and they're like yeah

593
00:23:57,639 --> 00:24:00,080
yeah I really loved that idea and then

594
00:24:00,080 --> 00:24:02,179
because they wouldn't sign it then they

595
00:24:02,179 --> 00:24:03,769
gave you sort of like official approval

596
00:24:03,769 --> 00:24:05,299
and then you could take that from like a

597
00:24:05,299 --> 00:24:07,159
very senior manager person to like every

598
00:24:07,159 --> 00:24:08,840
other team and you're like there's the

599
00:24:08,840 --> 00:24:10,390
scroll that says

600
00:24:10,390 --> 00:24:14,110
it's the director demands fix yes and

601
00:24:14,110 --> 00:24:17,230
also if there ever is a major breach and

602
00:24:17,230 --> 00:24:20,710
you have in writing you basically

603
00:24:20,710 --> 00:24:22,840
begging for permission to fix these

604
00:24:22,840 --> 00:24:26,110
things and upper manager refusing no

605
00:24:26,110 --> 00:24:27,430
one's going to really hang you out to

606
00:24:27,430 --> 00:24:29,950
dry on that I have used things like that

607
00:24:29,950 --> 00:24:33,490
when we have had problems I'm not going

608
00:24:33,490 --> 00:24:36,250
to say where it's been helpful to have

609
00:24:36,250 --> 00:24:38,260
things in writing repeatedly throughout

610
00:24:38,260 --> 00:24:53,500
my information security career so we've

611
00:24:53,500 --> 00:24:55,740
been chatting about a bunch of things

612
00:24:55,740 --> 00:24:58,120
that people should do and I was curious

613
00:24:58,120 --> 00:24:59,800
about flipping that like what are some

614
00:24:59,800 --> 00:25:01,270
things that you think security teams

615
00:25:01,270 --> 00:25:03,670
shouldn't do either because they're not

616
00:25:03,670 --> 00:25:06,520
a good use of time or they're

617
00:25:06,520 --> 00:25:09,670
counterproductive or yeah like what

618
00:25:09,670 --> 00:25:13,060
would you advise people not to do as

619
00:25:13,060 --> 00:25:14,830
high level or as tactical as you want I

620
00:25:14,830 --> 00:25:18,610
would say making pentesting security

621
00:25:18,610 --> 00:25:22,360
testing a gate to push something live

622
00:25:22,360 --> 00:25:27,190
almost never is a good idea it just puts

623
00:25:27,190 --> 00:25:28,450
the security team in a really tough

624
00:25:28,450 --> 00:25:29,170
position

625
00:25:29,170 --> 00:25:32,110
pen testing is not gonna be the most

626
00:25:32,110 --> 00:25:34,120
efficient way to actually secure your

627
00:25:34,120 --> 00:25:36,910
application it's helpful to kind of you

628
00:25:36,910 --> 00:25:39,010
know get a data point but it's

629
00:25:39,010 --> 00:25:40,750
definitely just one piece of a much

630
00:25:40,750 --> 00:25:43,840
larger program and I think using it as

631
00:25:43,840 --> 00:25:49,150
sort of a gate is not usually the right

632
00:25:49,150 --> 00:25:50,920
thing to do there's probably cases where

633
00:25:50,920 --> 00:25:53,350
it is but but yeah usually I think it

634
00:25:53,350 --> 00:25:54,730
could really burn out a security team

635
00:25:54,730 --> 00:25:57,460
and not be the best experience or the

636
00:25:57,460 --> 00:26:01,870
most useful output for the development

637
00:26:01,870 --> 00:26:05,770
teams definitely a Doug I think you had

638
00:26:05,770 --> 00:26:07,720
yeah oh yeah I gave you the high sign

639
00:26:07,720 --> 00:26:09,700
there yeah I should come up with a new

640
00:26:09,700 --> 00:26:11,200
one that's kind of I used that twice

641
00:26:11,200 --> 00:26:11,560
already

642
00:26:11,560 --> 00:26:14,620
um don't mess with the culture don't

643
00:26:14,620 --> 00:26:16,930
mess with the developer workflows don't

644
00:26:16,930 --> 00:26:17,770
be creepy

645
00:26:17,770 --> 00:26:20,650
oh we had this thing where we were we

646
00:26:20,650 --> 00:26:22,419
can like doing like slack key words and

647
00:26:22,419 --> 00:26:24,220
and you know like nb5 what are you

648
00:26:24,220 --> 00:26:25,629
talking about md5 I was thinking how

649
00:26:25,629 --> 00:26:26,619
could I help you you don't like that

650
00:26:26,619 --> 00:26:29,049
sort of thing I just ended up being

651
00:26:29,049 --> 00:26:32,739
super creepy you don't do that what else

652
00:26:32,739 --> 00:26:34,989
it yeah like you really have to like

653
00:26:34,989 --> 00:26:37,809
work within your culture of the cup of

654
00:26:37,809 --> 00:26:39,429
the company at the time that you're

655
00:26:39,429 --> 00:26:42,129
trying to to do this thing and you have

656
00:26:42,129 --> 00:26:46,029
to work within the the workflows of your

657
00:26:46,029 --> 00:26:48,129
developer like you know you have to use

658
00:26:48,129 --> 00:26:50,350
their IDs use their tools like again

659
00:26:50,350 --> 00:26:51,789
like work with them you'd like to live

660
00:26:51,789 --> 00:26:53,169
off the land like do the same things

661
00:26:53,169 --> 00:26:54,489
that they're doing and you will have a

662
00:26:54,489 --> 00:26:56,049
much better time than if you're trying

663
00:26:56,049 --> 00:26:57,999
to force them to some brand new workflow

664
00:26:57,999 --> 00:27:00,039
or like an extra step to do a thing you

665
00:27:00,039 --> 00:27:01,779
know if you make the secure thing the

666
00:27:01,779 --> 00:27:04,359
easy thing to do or the faster way to do

667
00:27:04,359 --> 00:27:08,200
you know nothing then you know like

668
00:27:08,200 --> 00:27:10,509
you're the acceptance is easy at that

669
00:27:10,509 --> 00:27:13,570
point or if you can even say like oh hey

670
00:27:13,570 --> 00:27:15,190
if you expose the secret in source code

671
00:27:15,190 --> 00:27:16,570
or you know you actually only committed

672
00:27:16,570 --> 00:27:18,609
the secret well you have to roll it now

673
00:27:18,609 --> 00:27:20,590
right and that's a pain in the butt for

674
00:27:20,590 --> 00:27:21,909
you to go to all these systems and roll

675
00:27:21,909 --> 00:27:25,210
all these secrets so you know get commit

676
00:27:25,210 --> 00:27:27,129
how cool this will like give you a

677
00:27:27,129 --> 00:27:28,600
little warning before you commit that

678
00:27:28,600 --> 00:27:30,249
and that will prevent you from doing

679
00:27:30,249 --> 00:27:32,019
that so even though though that is maybe

680
00:27:32,019 --> 00:27:33,309
an extra step and an extra thing that

681
00:27:33,309 --> 00:27:35,980
development may need to install it saves

682
00:27:35,980 --> 00:27:38,470
them the potential for a ton of work and

683
00:27:38,470 --> 00:27:40,450
a ton of disruption and so like you've

684
00:27:40,450 --> 00:27:42,309
you've taken this problem and found a

685
00:27:42,309 --> 00:27:44,950
shortcut to prevent it and it's even

686
00:27:44,950 --> 00:27:46,330
though that's an extra step or it might

687
00:27:46,330 --> 00:27:49,029
be like an extra thing that needs to

688
00:27:49,029 --> 00:27:52,529
happen it's still a recipe for success

689
00:27:52,529 --> 00:27:55,090
yeah

690
00:27:55,090 --> 00:27:58,049
I'm tossed went on here of I think

691
00:27:58,049 --> 00:28:00,700
something that's historically been very

692
00:28:00,700 --> 00:28:02,980
challenging for security teams is to be

693
00:28:02,980 --> 00:28:05,080
able to really think strategically and

694
00:28:05,080 --> 00:28:07,929
recognize that not everything needs to

695
00:28:07,929 --> 00:28:09,580
be perfect in fact you're gonna lose

696
00:28:09,580 --> 00:28:11,950
some battles and a lot of times it's

697
00:28:11,950 --> 00:28:14,080
gonna make a lot of sense to lose a

698
00:28:14,080 --> 00:28:17,259
battle to win the wider war of having a

699
00:28:17,259 --> 00:28:20,379
effective security program a story that

700
00:28:20,379 --> 00:28:22,809
I know the fellow Pamela's have heard me

701
00:28:22,809 --> 00:28:24,580
tell multiple times because we've we've

702
00:28:24,580 --> 00:28:26,379
all gotten to share a bunch of stuff a

703
00:28:26,379 --> 00:28:29,169
lot of times but I think is very worthy

704
00:28:29,169 --> 00:28:33,039
of this point right here was I was

705
00:28:33,039 --> 00:28:35,990
talking with a fortune 500 CEO and I

706
00:28:35,990 --> 00:28:38,990
ask them like hey how like how are you

707
00:28:38,990 --> 00:28:40,400
thinking about cloud how do you think

708
00:28:40,400 --> 00:28:41,690
about DevOps you know digital

709
00:28:41,690 --> 00:28:43,070
transformation whatever you want to

710
00:28:43,070 --> 00:28:44,330
whatever buzzword you want to call it

711
00:28:44,330 --> 00:28:46,220
and they stopped me and they're like oh

712
00:28:46,220 --> 00:28:47,780
yeah we're not doing that here like I'm

713
00:28:47,780 --> 00:28:50,270
not allowing that that's not secure and

714
00:28:50,270 --> 00:28:53,420
my reaction was yep Tonya is pretty much

715
00:28:53,420 --> 00:28:56,809
exactly like yours which was like okay

716
00:28:56,809 --> 00:28:59,660
that's a that's a bold career sure all

717
00:28:59,660 --> 00:29:02,690
right and I got to meet with the CIO

718
00:29:02,690 --> 00:29:05,000
afterwards and I asked them I'm like hey

719
00:29:05,000 --> 00:29:06,500
I'm curious you know like every CIO I

720
00:29:06,500 --> 00:29:08,720
talk to is all about digital

721
00:29:08,720 --> 00:29:11,059
transformation and cloud and DevOps and

722
00:29:11,059 --> 00:29:12,380
all these different pieces like oh yeah

723
00:29:12,380 --> 00:29:14,270
yeah it's extremely important here we

724
00:29:14,270 --> 00:29:16,190
have 50 apps in the cloud today we're

725
00:29:16,190 --> 00:29:17,540
gonna have 200 by the end of the year

726
00:29:17,540 --> 00:29:18,770
and we're gonna have several thousand

727
00:29:18,770 --> 00:29:21,110
next year and I looked at them and oh

728
00:29:21,110 --> 00:29:22,940
you talked to the sea so yeah we just

729
00:29:22,940 --> 00:29:24,440
don't tell them what's going on anymore

730
00:29:24,440 --> 00:29:25,990
because they try to say no to everything

731
00:29:25,990 --> 00:29:29,630
and I think it's the ultimate example I

732
00:29:29,630 --> 00:29:33,170
mean I'm sure anyone with a security

733
00:29:33,170 --> 00:29:35,420
role or title who's watching this right

734
00:29:35,420 --> 00:29:37,610
now just winced as badly as we all did

735
00:29:37,610 --> 00:29:40,370
when we heard that story but I think

736
00:29:40,370 --> 00:29:42,890
it's the perfect example of this right

737
00:29:42,890 --> 00:29:45,140
of security trying to fight tooth and

738
00:29:45,140 --> 00:29:47,090
nail to say no to everything until

739
00:29:47,090 --> 00:29:48,590
everything is you know perfect and

740
00:29:48,590 --> 00:29:50,179
secured and the rest of the business

741
00:29:50,179 --> 00:29:51,950
says that's that's great but we're gonna

742
00:29:51,950 --> 00:29:54,320
go on doing our job and when you can get

743
00:29:54,320 --> 00:29:56,840
your act together we'll come talk to you

744
00:29:56,840 --> 00:29:58,730
again but until then we're just gonna

745
00:29:58,730 --> 00:30:01,340
we're gonna go get our jobs done and so

746
00:30:01,340 --> 00:30:03,470
I you know I really think for you know

747
00:30:03,470 --> 00:30:05,630
what can security do wrong it's it's

748
00:30:05,630 --> 00:30:09,230
that it's trying to be a gatekeeper on

749
00:30:09,230 --> 00:30:11,690
everything rather than enabling folks to

750
00:30:11,690 --> 00:30:15,740
move mine's gonna build off of scenes

751
00:30:15,740 --> 00:30:21,170
cuz I've seen a lot of places where they

752
00:30:21,170 --> 00:30:24,020
have created bottlenecks not like

753
00:30:24,020 --> 00:30:26,330
maliciously but for instance we're gonna

754
00:30:26,330 --> 00:30:28,190
do the partnership model we heard

755
00:30:28,190 --> 00:30:30,650
Netflix doesn't it super cool and we're

756
00:30:30,650 --> 00:30:33,140
gonna pair our upset person with 50

757
00:30:33,140 --> 00:30:36,020
different projects and think that

758
00:30:36,020 --> 00:30:37,760
they're gonna magically be able to

759
00:30:37,760 --> 00:30:40,040
handle that and so then everything's

760
00:30:40,040 --> 00:30:41,960
waiting on this person all the time

761
00:30:41,960 --> 00:30:44,690
and their inbox looks like someone aimed

762
00:30:44,690 --> 00:30:47,750
a firehose at it and and then like

763
00:30:47,750 --> 00:30:51,530
everyone's pissed it's like oh can you

764
00:30:51,530 --> 00:30:54,050
see how that doesn't scale like if you

765
00:30:54,050 --> 00:30:56,210
have an app sect team like 14 people on

766
00:30:56,210 --> 00:30:58,130
it you told they can do that but a lot

767
00:30:58,130 --> 00:31:00,590
of the app sect teams are like the size

768
00:31:00,590 --> 00:31:03,559
of this box like one person not even as

769
00:31:03,559 --> 00:31:05,120
big as the whole box where you see all

770
00:31:05,120 --> 00:31:07,610
five of us and so it's like yeah if you

771
00:31:07,610 --> 00:31:09,770
have a hundred teams you can't have one

772
00:31:09,770 --> 00:31:12,919
exact person service all the projects

773
00:31:12,919 --> 00:31:14,600
that they're doing like that's not

774
00:31:14,600 --> 00:31:16,730
reasonably so you have to find processes

775
00:31:16,730 --> 00:31:18,440
that actually work with what everyone

776
00:31:18,440 --> 00:31:20,419
else is doing and make sure you can

777
00:31:20,419 --> 00:31:22,300
scale them or you need to calm down

778
00:31:22,300 --> 00:31:27,320
figure has a better plan because then

779
00:31:27,320 --> 00:31:28,550
they will do what they did with Sam

780
00:31:28,550 --> 00:31:29,870
where they just go around you were like

781
00:31:29,870 --> 00:31:35,480
thanks thanks for your input yeah I

782
00:31:35,480 --> 00:31:37,250
think having the organizational trust

783
00:31:37,250 --> 00:31:39,080
that people come to you

784
00:31:39,080 --> 00:31:40,880
ideally they come to you and tell you

785
00:31:40,880 --> 00:31:43,340
things that you want to know Zane has a

786
00:31:43,340 --> 00:31:45,320
funny story about that that we might get

787
00:31:45,320 --> 00:31:46,880
to at some point but at the very least

788
00:31:46,880 --> 00:31:49,130
they don't actively avoid you I think is

789
00:31:49,130 --> 00:31:49,929
good

790
00:31:49,929 --> 00:31:52,370
one thing I quickly wanted to build on

791
00:31:52,370 --> 00:31:54,890
what Doug was saying is like I totally

792
00:31:54,890 --> 00:31:57,530
agree that I think I'm making the secure

793
00:31:57,530 --> 00:32:00,110
way the easy default is the best way to

794
00:32:00,110 --> 00:32:02,690
do it but I almost want this is based on

795
00:32:02,690 --> 00:32:04,490
some chats with the friends at Netflix

796
00:32:04,490 --> 00:32:06,470
and a couple of other companies who said

797
00:32:06,470 --> 00:32:09,620
like it's great that it's very easy in

798
00:32:09,620 --> 00:32:10,880
the default but if you can even go

799
00:32:10,880 --> 00:32:12,740
further than that to make it even like

800
00:32:12,740 --> 00:32:15,260
easier to do within the normal way then

801
00:32:15,260 --> 00:32:17,120
it's like well of course I'm gonna do it

802
00:32:17,120 --> 00:32:20,030
because like I get telemetry out of the

803
00:32:20,030 --> 00:32:21,230
box for free

804
00:32:21,230 --> 00:32:23,000
maybe the secure rapper is like more

805
00:32:23,000 --> 00:32:25,460
performant it does like automatic

806
00:32:25,460 --> 00:32:27,650
service discoveries securely with other

807
00:32:27,650 --> 00:32:29,510
micro services like basically can you

808
00:32:29,510 --> 00:32:31,220
bundle other useful functionality in

809
00:32:31,220 --> 00:32:34,669
there for free the developers get that

810
00:32:34,669 --> 00:32:37,010
they want anyway maybe like dose

811
00:32:37,010 --> 00:32:38,870
protection or like more robustness

812
00:32:38,870 --> 00:32:40,580
basically there's like maybe 10

813
00:32:40,580 --> 00:32:42,590
attributes that developers care about in

814
00:32:42,590 --> 00:32:44,750
addition to security and if you can like

815
00:32:44,750 --> 00:32:46,490
make it just even better than the normal

816
00:32:46,490 --> 00:32:49,970
way it let alone the same that's an easy

817
00:32:49,970 --> 00:32:51,590
way to get buy-in because oh yeah this

818
00:32:51,590 --> 00:32:52,520
is even better than what I was doing

819
00:32:52,520 --> 00:32:55,090
before like a person gonna do that

820
00:32:55,090 --> 00:32:58,210
that's brilliant yeah I'm just borrowing

821
00:32:58,210 --> 00:33:00,749
it from other people

822
00:33:01,690 --> 00:33:06,100
it's called knowledge I go from first

823
00:33:06,100 --> 00:33:11,730
principles only yeah so I wanted to

824
00:33:11,730 --> 00:33:15,190
quickly go to some questions we got from

825
00:33:15,190 --> 00:33:19,029
Twitter before this so David asked or

826
00:33:19,029 --> 00:33:21,490
Bonilla asked what is your favorite

827
00:33:21,490 --> 00:33:23,470
pragmatics that is a bang for your buck

828
00:33:23,470 --> 00:33:26,740
does a cops practice or hack and he

829
00:33:26,740 --> 00:33:28,960
referenced something John Milton did

830
00:33:28,960 --> 00:33:30,460
where he had like a script to alert on

831
00:33:30,460 --> 00:33:32,830
new routes being added to an API as a

832
00:33:32,830 --> 00:33:34,809
way to monitor attack service but yeah

833
00:33:34,809 --> 00:33:36,490
you're their favorite bang for your buck

834
00:33:36,490 --> 00:33:55,899
and the cops practice or half soon as I

835
00:33:55,899 --> 00:33:57,070
figured out what you could have more

836
00:33:57,070 --> 00:33:59,619
than one pipeline for the same app I was

837
00:33:59,619 --> 00:34:02,200
like oh I'm gonna do all the crap and so

838
00:34:02,200 --> 00:34:03,610
like you're gonna have one pipeline that

839
00:34:03,610 --> 00:34:05,409
releases your code but then you can have

840
00:34:05,409 --> 00:34:08,109
another one on that same app and then

841
00:34:08,109 --> 00:34:10,270
you can just run all the slow stuff that

842
00:34:10,270 --> 00:34:12,520
no no one on the dev team or ops team

843
00:34:12,520 --> 00:34:14,379
wants to they're like Tanya we do not

844
00:34:14,379 --> 00:34:17,349
have time for your crab sauce skin it's

845
00:34:17,349 --> 00:34:19,030
like yeah but I could just like kick

846
00:34:19,030 --> 00:34:21,429
that off once in a while in the

847
00:34:21,429 --> 00:34:24,339
background and not knowing anyone so

848
00:34:24,339 --> 00:34:26,679
once I figured out like oh I can put

849
00:34:26,679 --> 00:34:29,020
like from some secret scanning and like

850
00:34:29,020 --> 00:34:31,389
some SCA let's say in my release

851
00:34:31,389 --> 00:34:33,790
pipeline or something else but then I'm

852
00:34:33,790 --> 00:34:37,119
like oh I want to do like in depth like

853
00:34:37,119 --> 00:34:40,030
long slow stuff because I still want to

854
00:34:40,030 --> 00:34:42,399
do that but I don't want to manually do

855
00:34:42,399 --> 00:34:44,500
that that's boring I had a job where I

856
00:34:44,500 --> 00:34:48,030
had to manually do each I quit that job

857
00:34:48,030 --> 00:34:50,679
and so like if I could create a pipeline

858
00:34:50,679 --> 00:34:52,780
that would like run you know my dad

859
00:34:52,780 --> 00:34:54,129
Skinner and this and that and like

860
00:34:54,129 --> 00:34:55,839
they're dumb they're not as smart as if

861
00:34:55,839 --> 00:34:57,910
you're there running it but I could just

862
00:34:57,910 --> 00:35:00,220
get come in on Monday and dig through

863
00:35:00,220 --> 00:35:03,790
lots of stuff yeah I like it when I

864
00:35:03,790 --> 00:35:07,259
don't have to do the boring stuff

865
00:35:07,500 --> 00:35:10,770
so uh I was gonna say like I don't know

866
00:35:10,770 --> 00:35:12,300
that I'd even call it static analysis

867
00:35:12,300 --> 00:35:14,250
and maybe captain call it like pattern

868
00:35:14,250 --> 00:35:15,810
matching you know just like some basic

869
00:35:15,810 --> 00:35:17,700
Reggie and Clinton try to restrain

870
00:35:17,700 --> 00:35:21,380
yourself but there's a reg reg X based

871
00:35:21,380 --> 00:35:23,820
code pattern matching like look for

872
00:35:23,820 --> 00:35:27,150
known bad patterns in your organ right

873
00:35:27,150 --> 00:35:29,430
you can find five or six of those and

874
00:35:29,430 --> 00:35:32,580
just get those into your your

875
00:35:32,580 --> 00:35:33,870
development pipeline or you're quoting

876
00:35:33,870 --> 00:35:36,270
five line C Exedy whatever the proper

877
00:35:36,270 --> 00:35:38,580
term is there um I'm just gonna stream

878
00:35:38,580 --> 00:35:41,070
of consciousness now look at like that's

879
00:35:41,070 --> 00:35:42,420
you can get a lot of bang for your buck

880
00:35:42,420 --> 00:35:44,460
in that way and then also I think just

881
00:35:44,460 --> 00:35:45,810
from the people point of view like I

882
00:35:45,810 --> 00:35:47,790
don't I know this question was probably

883
00:35:47,790 --> 00:35:49,080
focused more on the technical side of

884
00:35:49,080 --> 00:35:52,110
things but um the the softer side of

885
00:35:52,110 --> 00:35:53,640
things general awareness sending out a

886
00:35:53,640 --> 00:35:57,660
newsletter giving a presentation just

887
00:35:57,660 --> 00:35:59,550
like anything that raises your overall

888
00:35:59,550 --> 00:36:01,440
like visibility within the organization

889
00:36:01,440 --> 00:36:03,390
and then even on the technical side

890
00:36:03,390 --> 00:36:04,830
anything that gives you additional

891
00:36:04,830 --> 00:36:07,440
visibility to what's happening you know

892
00:36:07,440 --> 00:36:09,660
on your networks in your app that sort

893
00:36:09,660 --> 00:36:11,730
of thing log log all the things sort of

894
00:36:11,730 --> 00:36:14,010
that later right so visibility in both

895
00:36:14,010 --> 00:36:15,810
and you know in both sections of that

896
00:36:15,810 --> 00:36:18,480
are it can be incredibly helpful yeah oh

897
00:36:18,480 --> 00:36:20,580
I'll build one small thing off of Doug's

898
00:36:20,580 --> 00:36:22,200
there cuz that's where I was going as

899
00:36:22,200 --> 00:36:24,690
well as around the visibility piece the

900
00:36:24,690 --> 00:36:27,210
I think the best bang for your buck that

901
00:36:27,210 --> 00:36:29,130
you can do as far as devstack ops and

902
00:36:29,130 --> 00:36:30,630
whatever whatever that means to

903
00:36:30,630 --> 00:36:33,500
everybody is giving security visibility

904
00:36:33,500 --> 00:36:36,360
not just in front of security people but

905
00:36:36,360 --> 00:36:38,220
in front of the development teams and

906
00:36:38,220 --> 00:36:40,590
DevOps teams because no matter no matter

907
00:36:40,590 --> 00:36:42,810
how fast your security team is scaling

908
00:36:42,810 --> 00:36:44,610
and your security program is scaling the

909
00:36:44,610 --> 00:36:46,290
engineering organization is scaling ten

910
00:36:46,290 --> 00:36:48,330
times faster and so like you're never

911
00:36:48,330 --> 00:36:49,560
going to keep up in fact you're getting

912
00:36:49,560 --> 00:36:51,870
further behind every day and the only

913
00:36:51,870 --> 00:36:53,790
way you actually scale a security

914
00:36:53,790 --> 00:36:57,060
program in an organ through DevOps and

915
00:36:57,060 --> 00:36:58,770
cloud and all these different changes is

916
00:36:58,770 --> 00:37:00,810
by getting security capabilities in

917
00:37:00,810 --> 00:37:02,700
front of the development teams and

918
00:37:02,700 --> 00:37:05,490
DevOps teams you know way that they can

919
00:37:05,490 --> 00:37:07,020
actually consume not just blinding them

920
00:37:07,020 --> 00:37:13,650
with it here's a page PDF like you have

921
00:37:13,650 --> 00:37:15,270
to get disability in front of them that

922
00:37:15,270 --> 00:37:17,670
they can actually use mmm that kind of

923
00:37:17,670 --> 00:37:19,380
ties in what with what I think time I

924
00:37:19,380 --> 00:37:20,430
was saying you know one of

925
00:37:20,430 --> 00:37:22,110
first kind of points that we are making

926
00:37:22,110 --> 00:37:23,580
there you know as far as like it's not

927
00:37:23,580 --> 00:37:25,110
just a pop-up box it makes it look silly

928
00:37:25,110 --> 00:37:27,270
like these are all the people attacking

929
00:37:27,270 --> 00:37:36,120
you right now like bulb moment sure yeah

930
00:37:36,120 --> 00:37:38,220
just team did you want add anything yeah

931
00:37:38,220 --> 00:37:41,970
I didn't think I saw ice but I just want

932
00:37:41,970 --> 00:37:46,830
to give you yeah I mean I again I'm not

933
00:37:46,830 --> 00:37:47,550
I can't

934
00:37:47,550 --> 00:37:49,100
I'm not coming up with something

935
00:37:49,100 --> 00:37:51,660
technical but I have something saying

936
00:37:51,660 --> 00:37:55,830
brother before small hacks like for

937
00:37:55,830 --> 00:38:00,660
example having a custom logger that you

938
00:38:00,660 --> 00:38:03,180
have everyone use and when they

939
00:38:03,180 --> 00:38:06,170
accidentally log the credit card number

940
00:38:06,170 --> 00:38:09,390
you replace that with this is why we

941
00:38:09,390 --> 00:38:10,980
can't have nice things and then they go

942
00:38:10,980 --> 00:38:13,080
and they see that in their logs and they

943
00:38:13,080 --> 00:38:15,150
know both that they made the mistake

944
00:38:15,150 --> 00:38:17,370
you've also protected yourself from

945
00:38:17,370 --> 00:38:21,630
logging things just small things like

946
00:38:21,630 --> 00:38:23,130
that I think someone mentioned something

947
00:38:23,130 --> 00:38:25,410
before about just having these visual

948
00:38:25,410 --> 00:38:28,140
reminders of like let's just rename this

949
00:38:28,140 --> 00:38:30,840
function across our entire you know and

950
00:38:30,840 --> 00:38:33,120
all of our rest of library let's rename

951
00:38:33,120 --> 00:38:35,220
it to unsafe I'm safe let's they've

952
00:38:35,220 --> 00:38:38,070
never used this and you know like that

953
00:38:38,070 --> 00:38:38,880
kind of thing

954
00:38:38,880 --> 00:38:41,280
I think those small things can be

955
00:38:41,280 --> 00:38:55,500
helpful for some reason there's a lot of

956
00:38:55,500 --> 00:38:57,030
people with a credit card number this is

957
00:38:57,030 --> 00:39:01,980
why she can vanity and one I guess yeah

958
00:39:01,980 --> 00:39:07,320
it just wants a license plate you guys

959
00:39:07,320 --> 00:39:12,800
have heard of a number one

960
00:39:13,590 --> 00:39:16,530
I just want to tack on a few things like

961
00:39:16,530 --> 00:39:18,930
I I totally agree with Doug about

962
00:39:18,930 --> 00:39:21,240
looking for like known bad things in

963
00:39:21,240 --> 00:39:25,140
terms of hey like eval shell exact like

964
00:39:25,140 --> 00:39:27,210
things that are like this turning off to

965
00:39:27,210 --> 00:39:28,830
us sort verification like you don't

966
00:39:28,830 --> 00:39:30,300
necessarily need to know a lot of

967
00:39:30,300 --> 00:39:31,890
context around the code to know that

968
00:39:31,890 --> 00:39:33,650
like this is maybe a bad thing

969
00:39:33,650 --> 00:39:37,190
and then to shamelessly call out

970
00:39:37,190 --> 00:39:39,900
something from Zane's black cat talk a

971
00:39:39,900 --> 00:39:43,680
few years ago that I really liked is not

972
00:39:43,680 --> 00:39:45,540
just necessarily who liked it that's

973
00:39:45,540 --> 00:39:50,430
great there's one view on YouTube and I

974
00:39:50,430 --> 00:39:55,640
feel very honored there are dozens of us

975
00:39:55,640 --> 00:39:58,830
but I had a very very insightful where

976
00:39:58,830 --> 00:40:00,590
it's like you don't necessarily have to

977
00:40:00,590 --> 00:40:02,790
find like oh this is the vulnerability

978
00:40:02,790 --> 00:40:05,010
sometimes as a security team you just

979
00:40:05,010 --> 00:40:08,310
want visibility where you maybe have

980
00:40:08,310 --> 00:40:10,920
like a code bases the responsible for

981
00:40:10,920 --> 00:40:12,990
accessing like your most sensitive PII

982
00:40:12,990 --> 00:40:15,420
and you might want to see like Oh win

983
00:40:15,420 --> 00:40:17,520
our new repos starting to use that

984
00:40:17,520 --> 00:40:19,140
library that lets them talk to the sense

985
00:40:19,140 --> 00:40:20,850
of the PII because oh this is now like

986
00:40:20,850 --> 00:40:23,760
an interesting attack service or this

987
00:40:23,760 --> 00:40:26,340
repo didn't used to have crypto but now

988
00:40:26,340 --> 00:40:27,810
it does so like this is kind of

989
00:40:27,810 --> 00:40:30,660
interesting or like what are all the

990
00:40:30,660 --> 00:40:35,280
code repos doing shell exact or like we

991
00:40:35,280 --> 00:40:37,290
have this specific way to do often

992
00:40:37,290 --> 00:40:40,890
are their repos where that's happening

993
00:40:40,890 --> 00:40:42,840
inconsistently or maybe not at all that

994
00:40:42,840 --> 00:40:44,280
we would expect to because it's internet

995
00:40:44,280 --> 00:40:45,840
facing or something like that so like

996
00:40:45,840 --> 00:40:47,730
all these factors are not necessarily a

997
00:40:47,730 --> 00:40:50,430
vulnerability but I think like having

998
00:40:50,430 --> 00:40:52,110
maybe continuous lack notifications in

999
00:40:52,110 --> 00:40:53,670
the app SEC room about like some of this

1000
00:40:53,670 --> 00:40:55,980
like security relevant things happening

1001
00:40:55,980 --> 00:41:01,490
I think is very interesting yeah so yeah

1002
00:41:01,490 --> 00:41:04,290
anyone okay about time we've been the

1003
00:41:04,290 --> 00:41:08,010
next audience thing any uh okay say I

1004
00:41:08,010 --> 00:41:10,500
can't imagine be like being on an app

1005
00:41:10,500 --> 00:41:12,450
tech team that had a slack channel

1006
00:41:12,450 --> 00:41:14,640
because it's always been just yeah

1007
00:41:14,640 --> 00:41:19,350
almost every place I worked at like high

1008
00:41:19,350 --> 00:41:25,680
with the access to you my god I covet

1009
00:41:25,680 --> 00:41:29,550
that idea you could create your own

1010
00:41:29,550 --> 00:41:31,200
slack instance for your company and just

1011
00:41:31,200 --> 00:41:36,049
message yourself yeah yeah me

1012
00:41:39,869 --> 00:41:47,410
so next question huh question is from

1013
00:41:47,410 --> 00:41:50,710
Barbara she be curious to know your

1014
00:41:50,710 --> 00:41:52,750
views on where to draw the line in

1015
00:41:52,750 --> 00:41:55,210
responsibility sort of where do you

1016
00:41:55,210 --> 00:41:57,670
split that between development teams and

1017
00:41:57,670 --> 00:41:59,200
the security team so there's some

1018
00:41:59,200 --> 00:42:00,970
trade-off between allowing full autonomy

1019
00:42:00,970 --> 00:42:02,559
and providing security in the

1020
00:42:02,559 --> 00:42:04,930
self-service mode versus having a

1021
00:42:04,930 --> 00:42:07,000
central measuring and maintaining of an

1022
00:42:07,000 --> 00:42:10,180
adequate security state so so it's

1023
00:42:10,180 --> 00:42:11,740
probably a spectrum but yeah curious to

1024
00:42:11,740 --> 00:42:15,760
hear your thoughts who's who's blinking

1025
00:42:15,760 --> 00:42:16,960
the most who's going first yeah right

1026
00:42:16,960 --> 00:42:19,960
I'll go cuz I saw this I saw this

1027
00:42:19,960 --> 00:42:22,540
question on Twitter or and slide some

1028
00:42:22,540 --> 00:42:24,130
later that was a really good question I

1029
00:42:24,130 --> 00:42:27,190
thought was interesting um my and again

1030
00:42:27,190 --> 00:42:30,130
like when it's kind of like a very broad

1031
00:42:30,130 --> 00:42:33,010
set of constraints here right but and so

1032
00:42:33,010 --> 00:42:35,319
like I you know I hate that Mena my mind

1033
00:42:35,319 --> 00:42:37,030
always does my mind always goes

1034
00:42:37,030 --> 00:42:39,040
immediately to well it depends but a

1035
00:42:39,040 --> 00:42:41,109
kind of best man right depends on the

1036
00:42:41,109 --> 00:42:42,430
type of organization you're in you know

1037
00:42:42,430 --> 00:42:45,309
um so data dog is very engineering heavy

1038
00:42:45,309 --> 00:42:47,140
you know culture and very you know

1039
00:42:47,140 --> 00:42:49,630
absolute this is our product and kind of

1040
00:42:49,630 --> 00:42:51,430
Engineers who use the product and and

1041
00:42:51,430 --> 00:42:54,339
and provide a lot of feedback to each

1042
00:42:54,339 --> 00:42:57,780
other right and so in that particular

1043
00:42:57,780 --> 00:43:01,390
environment it becomes you know there's

1044
00:43:01,390 --> 00:43:02,799
so much code being written there's so

1045
00:43:02,799 --> 00:43:04,780
much engineering work being done as

1046
00:43:04,780 --> 00:43:06,220
ain't said earlier like there's no

1047
00:43:06,220 --> 00:43:07,930
possible way the screw team could catch

1048
00:43:07,930 --> 00:43:10,869
up you know in a legacy context and so

1049
00:43:10,869 --> 00:43:13,750
you have to kind of rely on providing

1050
00:43:13,750 --> 00:43:17,980
tools and awareness in general general

1051
00:43:17,980 --> 00:43:19,869
security knowledge to the rest of the

1052
00:43:19,869 --> 00:43:21,010
orange so you have to like lean on them

1053
00:43:21,010 --> 00:43:22,720
a little bit more than you would it may

1054
00:43:22,720 --> 00:43:24,430
be a company with a different set of

1055
00:43:24,430 --> 00:43:27,250
cultural norms and so it's in and I

1056
00:43:27,250 --> 00:43:29,230
think it also changes over time as well

1057
00:43:29,230 --> 00:43:31,900
right so you know maybe as the company

1058
00:43:31,900 --> 00:43:33,460
is smaller you need a larger team and

1059
00:43:33,460 --> 00:43:35,500
then you know that security team kind of

1060
00:43:35,500 --> 00:43:37,390
actually maybe branches out doesn't

1061
00:43:37,390 --> 00:43:40,650
embedding sort of thing with with

1062
00:43:40,650 --> 00:43:42,730
specific development teams and then

1063
00:43:42,730 --> 00:43:46,089
maybe you have a number of advisors sort

1064
00:43:46,089 --> 00:43:47,559
of things that are that are providing

1065
00:43:47,559 --> 00:43:50,619
the tools techniques like I act as the

1066
00:43:50,619 --> 00:43:52,660
you know the final arbiter of various

1067
00:43:52,660 --> 00:43:53,490
security decision

1068
00:43:53,490 --> 00:43:55,590
or they do a lot of the architectural

1069
00:43:55,590 --> 00:43:58,230
design work that sort of thing and you

1070
00:43:58,230 --> 00:44:00,780
know it you know again a very mature

1071
00:44:00,780 --> 00:44:03,540
Paul program you can have developers I

1072
00:44:03,540 --> 00:44:05,040
take out take on much more the

1073
00:44:05,040 --> 00:44:07,680
responsibility with just you know the

1074
00:44:07,680 --> 00:44:09,510
wise old graybeard they're providing

1075
00:44:09,510 --> 00:44:11,940
advice from on high you know it really

1076
00:44:11,940 --> 00:44:14,070
all depends but that's a couple things

1077
00:44:14,070 --> 00:44:17,450
that I thought about yeah I think it's

1078
00:44:17,450 --> 00:44:20,160
like I think it's it's a good question

1079
00:44:20,160 --> 00:44:21,630
and it's a tricky question because at

1080
00:44:21,630 --> 00:44:23,760
its core it's really a political

1081
00:44:23,760 --> 00:44:26,190
question more than a technical one right

1082
00:44:26,190 --> 00:44:27,720
I think you've got some organizations

1083
00:44:27,720 --> 00:44:29,430
that there's one end of the spectrum

1084
00:44:29,430 --> 00:44:31,350
like like Doug mentioned where it's a

1085
00:44:31,350 --> 00:44:35,180
you know very tech focused you know

1086
00:44:35,180 --> 00:44:38,940
startup sort of company that you know

1087
00:44:38,940 --> 00:44:40,530
like the engineering teams totally run

1088
00:44:40,530 --> 00:44:42,780
the show and security can kind of advise

1089
00:44:42,780 --> 00:44:43,980
on that and then there's other

1090
00:44:43,980 --> 00:44:45,840
organizations with like you know it's a

1091
00:44:45,840 --> 00:44:47,970
financial services it's heavily

1092
00:44:47,970 --> 00:44:50,400
regulated where security has to sign off

1093
00:44:50,400 --> 00:44:52,200
on everything if they don't want to

1094
00:44:52,200 --> 00:44:53,580
because of regulatory and compliance

1095
00:44:53,580 --> 00:44:56,190
needs I think most organizations find

1096
00:44:56,190 --> 00:44:58,050
themselves somewhere between those two

1097
00:44:58,050 --> 00:45:00,150
and that's why it's really tricky is

1098
00:45:00,150 --> 00:45:02,730
that the thing I would encourage you to

1099
00:45:02,730 --> 00:45:05,040
think about there if you find yourself

1100
00:45:05,040 --> 00:45:07,230
between those two kind of goal posts is

1101
00:45:07,230 --> 00:45:09,570
you know you find you optimize for what

1102
00:45:09,570 --> 00:45:11,160
is gonna politically work best inside

1103
00:45:11,160 --> 00:45:13,010
your organization in some it's gonna be

1104
00:45:13,010 --> 00:45:15,270
really embedding with the application

1105
00:45:15,270 --> 00:45:16,800
teams and DevOps teams or the

1106
00:45:16,800 --> 00:45:18,030
engineering teams and others it's gonna

1107
00:45:18,030 --> 00:45:19,830
be security some more central service

1108
00:45:19,830 --> 00:45:21,390
that other ones kind of come to and talk

1109
00:45:21,390 --> 00:45:23,820
to you but it's kind of you know in the

1110
00:45:23,820 --> 00:45:28,290
in the sense of not trying to maintain

1111
00:45:28,290 --> 00:45:30,750
the illusion of control and then

1112
00:45:30,750 --> 00:45:33,750
everyone goes around you like I think

1113
00:45:33,750 --> 00:45:35,490
the the thing for most organizations as

1114
00:45:35,490 --> 00:45:37,380
they're going through cloud and DevOps

1115
00:45:37,380 --> 00:45:39,660
and digital transformation is they're

1116
00:45:39,660 --> 00:45:41,490
changing the way that they create and

1117
00:45:41,490 --> 00:45:44,850
deliver software and technology and

1118
00:45:44,850 --> 00:45:46,290
Security's got to change along with that

1119
00:45:46,290 --> 00:45:48,330
and so it this was fuzzy to begin with

1120
00:45:48,330 --> 00:45:50,460
it's getting more fuzzy right now and I

1121
00:45:50,460 --> 00:45:51,359
think the challenge for most

1122
00:45:51,359 --> 00:45:52,650
organizations not that this really

1123
00:45:52,650 --> 00:45:55,080
answers your question or solves it but

1124
00:45:55,080 --> 00:45:57,480
so much as everyone was dealing with the

1125
00:45:57,480 --> 00:45:59,130
same challenge and the ones who are

1126
00:45:59,130 --> 00:46:00,690
doing it successfully are the ones who

1127
00:46:00,690 --> 00:46:02,430
are recognizing that Security's going to

1128
00:46:02,430 --> 00:46:03,690
have to change as part of this and

1129
00:46:03,690 --> 00:46:06,180
finding what what

1130
00:46:06,180 --> 00:46:08,040
and of that spectrum works best inside

1131
00:46:08,040 --> 00:46:09,690
your organization is the ones that

1132
00:46:09,690 --> 00:46:13,080
actually like really find success and

1133
00:46:13,080 --> 00:46:17,880
that kind of new home for security yeah

1134
00:46:17,880 --> 00:46:20,730
I'd also say that yeah I completely

1135
00:46:20,730 --> 00:46:22,650
agree it's a real tricky question and

1136
00:46:22,650 --> 00:46:23,940
the lines are just getting more and more

1137
00:46:23,940 --> 00:46:25,620
blurry which maybe that's what's

1138
00:46:25,620 --> 00:46:27,510
supposed to happen you know we're

1139
00:46:27,510 --> 00:46:29,820
supposed to kind of blend together but I

1140
00:46:29,820 --> 00:46:31,050
do think there are certain functions

1141
00:46:31,050 --> 00:46:33,600
that benefit from being a centralized

1142
00:46:33,600 --> 00:46:37,800
function one of them being defense so

1143
00:46:37,800 --> 00:46:41,490
the people that are managing the alerts

1144
00:46:41,490 --> 00:46:43,320
coming in from all the systems that are

1145
00:46:43,320 --> 00:46:44,610
figuring out how to write new alerts

1146
00:46:44,610 --> 00:46:45,840
that are figuring out how to tune

1147
00:46:45,840 --> 00:46:47,340
detection systems that are figuring out

1148
00:46:47,340 --> 00:46:50,790
how to handle huge log pipelines like

1149
00:46:50,790 --> 00:46:52,800
these aren't things you want your entire

1150
00:46:52,800 --> 00:46:55,230
engineering team to have to figure we

1151
00:46:55,230 --> 00:46:56,750
figure out over and over again

1152
00:46:56,750 --> 00:46:59,970
especially when it's not in their area

1153
00:46:59,970 --> 00:47:03,000
of expertise so I think that that there

1154
00:47:03,000 --> 00:47:04,680
are some functions that are really

1155
00:47:04,680 --> 00:47:07,670
better suited to being more centralized

1156
00:47:07,670 --> 00:47:10,200
but when it comes to especially

1157
00:47:10,200 --> 00:47:12,870
application security I think that blend

1158
00:47:12,870 --> 00:47:15,170
is kind of where it should be you know

1159
00:47:15,170 --> 00:47:18,390
kind of where that we don't yeah I also

1160
00:47:18,390 --> 00:47:20,510
always try to think of security as

1161
00:47:20,510 --> 00:47:24,870
trusted advisors so we will tell you we

1162
00:47:24,870 --> 00:47:26,490
will give you all the information that

1163
00:47:26,490 --> 00:47:28,740
we can to help you make the right

1164
00:47:28,740 --> 00:47:32,040
decision because it's your product and

1165
00:47:32,040 --> 00:47:33,450
your thing that you're pushing out there

1166
00:47:33,450 --> 00:47:37,800
so that may be one line one kind of

1167
00:47:37,800 --> 00:47:41,510
fuzzy line that you could look at yeah I

1168
00:47:41,510 --> 00:47:45,180
find often so I do a lot of consulting

1169
00:47:45,180 --> 00:47:47,970
quite often people will call me in and

1170
00:47:47,970 --> 00:47:50,610
they want to create a policy so they can

1171
00:47:50,610 --> 00:47:52,620
like walk around and whack people on the

1172
00:47:52,620 --> 00:47:55,860
head with it and I've explained how that

1173
00:47:55,860 --> 00:48:00,860
will get them not invited to parties

1174
00:48:01,280 --> 00:48:05,010
though B I'm popular and people will go

1175
00:48:05,010 --> 00:48:07,710
around them as discussed and there would

1176
00:48:07,710 --> 00:48:09,840
be a lot smarter like when I've created

1177
00:48:09,840 --> 00:48:12,210
policies or standards or whatever I do

1178
00:48:12,210 --> 00:48:14,910
this weird thing where I ask the

1179
00:48:14,910 --> 00:48:17,790
developers what they think and then I

1180
00:48:17,790 --> 00:48:19,000
can bite them to come

1181
00:48:19,000 --> 00:48:21,520
have meetings hang out bring like

1182
00:48:21,520 --> 00:48:23,860
doughnuts or whatever is the stuff that

1183
00:48:23,860 --> 00:48:25,600
people eat at that place because some

1184
00:48:25,600 --> 00:48:27,870
people are like no work looking free I

1185
00:48:27,870 --> 00:48:31,090
I'm gluten free by anyway so I figure

1186
00:48:31,090 --> 00:48:33,310
out what their jam is and then try to

1187
00:48:33,310 --> 00:48:35,170
like wore them in I'm like did you know

1188
00:48:35,170 --> 00:48:38,470
I have pizza and then and then like ask

1189
00:48:38,470 --> 00:48:40,750
them like so like we want to set up this

1190
00:48:40,750 --> 00:48:43,900
is like a standard but I know you can't

1191
00:48:43,900 --> 00:48:46,600
meet it now or some of you can but like

1192
00:48:46,600 --> 00:48:48,640
how can I make this you know six month

1193
00:48:48,640 --> 00:48:51,730
plan so that you can meet it or like do

1194
00:48:51,730 --> 00:48:53,500
you feel this is reasonable or like Oh

1195
00:48:53,500 --> 00:48:55,870
number seventeen like that's not

1196
00:48:55,870 --> 00:48:58,000
pickable because if wha okay or like

1197
00:48:58,000 --> 00:49:00,520
could we adjust this or you know what I

1198
00:49:00,520 --> 00:49:01,960
mean and then like talk with them about

1199
00:49:01,960 --> 00:49:04,750
it and then when it comes out most

1200
00:49:04,750 --> 00:49:06,880
people who are the type of person that

1201
00:49:06,880 --> 00:49:09,820
would speak up has had their opportunity

1202
00:49:09,820 --> 00:49:12,220
to speak up and I've like adjusted

1203
00:49:12,220 --> 00:49:14,620
things and like tried to compromise and

1204
00:49:14,620 --> 00:49:16,390
then it's like okay so now we have like

1205
00:49:16,390 --> 00:49:18,880
this plan and it's a guideline right now

1206
00:49:18,880 --> 00:49:20,560
but in six months it's going to be a

1207
00:49:20,560 --> 00:49:23,500
standard for all new apps and within one

1208
00:49:23,500 --> 00:49:25,540
year all the old apps need to be

1209
00:49:25,540 --> 00:49:27,460
compliant and we are going to make a

1210
00:49:27,460 --> 00:49:29,320
plan and I'm gonna check in really

1211
00:49:29,320 --> 00:49:32,530
friendly like with donuts to ask how is

1212
00:49:32,530 --> 00:49:35,440
it go in it's been a month what's up how

1213
00:49:35,440 --> 00:49:38,650
are you doing and like go like that if

1214
00:49:38,650 --> 00:49:40,900
that makes sense and I find a lot of

1215
00:49:40,900 --> 00:49:42,730
places they're like we want this so that

1216
00:49:42,730 --> 00:49:44,260
we can walk around and black people with

1217
00:49:44,260 --> 00:49:46,600
it and I'm like oh no if you know how to

1218
00:49:46,600 --> 00:49:49,300
make friends very well but I have to

1219
00:49:49,300 --> 00:49:53,010
persuade them I view myself as an

1220
00:49:53,010 --> 00:49:55,900
influencer of secured yeah like

1221
00:49:55,900 --> 00:49:58,870
influenced the devs I try to show them

1222
00:49:58,870 --> 00:50:02,050
and and and say like I'll come help you

1223
00:50:02,050 --> 00:50:04,780
be compliant like let me do can I give

1224
00:50:04,780 --> 00:50:06,640
you a lunch of learn on this or whatever

1225
00:50:06,640 --> 00:50:10,900
the thing is to get us there and I have

1226
00:50:10,900 --> 00:50:13,300
got much better results with honey and

1227
00:50:13,300 --> 00:50:15,400
then once most the people are on and

1228
00:50:15,400 --> 00:50:17,200
we're accepting it if there's like one

1229
00:50:17,200 --> 00:50:18,970
or two teams are just not on board

1230
00:50:18,970 --> 00:50:20,830
that's where I'm like okay you're gonna

1231
00:50:20,830 --> 00:50:24,250
meet me and Tanya because she has me to

1232
00:50:24,250 --> 00:50:26,560
risk acceptance sheet for someone and I

1233
00:50:26,560 --> 00:50:28,110
just decided I

1234
00:50:28,110 --> 00:50:33,050
I'm coming with you coming over to you

1235
00:50:33,440 --> 00:50:37,920
now do you want my toe but usually I

1236
00:50:37,920 --> 00:50:39,870
find people get on board especially if

1237
00:50:39,870 --> 00:50:42,630
you go and you ask them like so you live

1238
00:50:42,630 --> 00:50:44,940
in the in the bug tracker and you've

1239
00:50:44,940 --> 00:50:47,130
marked all the things I put in is fixed

1240
00:50:47,130 --> 00:50:49,890
but they're like not fixed and you like

1241
00:50:49,890 --> 00:50:51,210
definitely didn't fix them or do

1242
00:50:51,210 --> 00:50:53,430
anything I did like you just I see you

1243
00:50:53,430 --> 00:50:57,350
mark them all in a one-minute period

1244
00:51:01,370 --> 00:51:03,810
should we have beer to talk about this

1245
00:51:03,810 --> 00:51:06,530
is that necessary like you need hug

1246
00:51:06,530 --> 00:51:17,850
that's all for specific if this were to

1247
00:51:17,850 --> 00:51:32,370
have hat like that example of like just

1248
00:51:32,370 --> 00:51:34,130
getting by in from the beginning I think

1249
00:51:34,130 --> 00:51:37,380
Riot Games as well as seek the

1250
00:51:37,380 --> 00:51:40,920
engineering teams have this like RFC

1251
00:51:40,920 --> 00:51:42,630
process where whether trying to use a

1252
00:51:42,630 --> 00:51:44,430
new technology your framework or just

1253
00:51:44,430 --> 00:51:47,010
building out a big system and how things

1254
00:51:47,010 --> 00:51:48,120
are going to work they write this very

1255
00:51:48,120 --> 00:51:49,980
detailed RFC if it's like this is how

1256
00:51:49,980 --> 00:51:51,930
it's gonna work this is why this is so

1257
00:51:51,930 --> 00:51:53,880
like deep dive and all the different

1258
00:51:53,880 --> 00:51:55,770
design trade notes and the securities

1259
00:51:55,770 --> 00:51:57,810
there have adopted a similar approach

1260
00:51:57,810 --> 00:51:59,400
where they're like hey we think that we

1261
00:51:59,400 --> 00:52:01,650
should do this because of the security

1262
00:52:01,650 --> 00:52:03,330
benefits blah blah blah and basically

1263
00:52:03,330 --> 00:52:05,160
having the engineers comment on it and

1264
00:52:05,160 --> 00:52:07,320
iterate to a agreed upon solution

1265
00:52:07,320 --> 00:52:09,720
together and then when it's time to roll

1266
00:52:09,720 --> 00:52:11,130
it out it's like hey we already agreed

1267
00:52:11,130 --> 00:52:13,110
this isn't a surprise we didn't come up

1268
00:52:13,110 --> 00:52:14,490
with its in isolation and there's

1269
00:52:14,490 --> 00:52:16,140
probably a lot of things that this is

1270
00:52:16,140 --> 00:52:18,600
security team we may not be aware of

1271
00:52:18,600 --> 00:52:19,920
like oh we thought this would be a good

1272
00:52:19,920 --> 00:52:21,780
approach but it's gonna be a killer for

1273
00:52:21,780 --> 00:52:22,890
latency or something which is

1274
00:52:22,890 --> 00:52:24,510
unacceptable for this specific service

1275
00:52:24,510 --> 00:52:25,140
or something

1276
00:52:25,140 --> 00:52:28,550
yeah so yeah I really like that approach

1277
00:52:28,550 --> 00:52:32,600
it's I stole it and so we had a

1278
00:52:32,600 --> 00:52:34,770
administer ones who had to make the

1279
00:52:34,770 --> 00:52:37,440
budget for Canada for the year and he

1280
00:52:37,440 --> 00:52:39,610
just slowly released

1281
00:52:39,610 --> 00:52:41,080
pieces of information and like

1282
00:52:41,080 --> 00:52:43,960
publicized them at a time like ask for

1283
00:52:43,960 --> 00:52:45,580
comment and so by the time the budget

1284
00:52:45,580 --> 00:52:47,230
came out everyone was already on board

1285
00:52:47,230 --> 00:52:50,710
and everyone's like that every year so

1286
00:52:50,710 --> 00:52:52,630
the whole time of Canada's existence

1287
00:52:52,630 --> 00:52:54,070
like because usually what they would do

1288
00:52:54,070 --> 00:52:59,170
is they would like and he's like oh is

1289
00:52:59,170 --> 00:53:06,370
this cool we did we do that with the

1290
00:53:06,370 --> 00:53:08,200
election results as well when we count

1291
00:53:08,200 --> 00:53:10,090
all the ballots we have all the members

1292
00:53:10,090 --> 00:53:11,470
of the media and all the different

1293
00:53:11,470 --> 00:53:13,450
parties in the room so then when in

1294
00:53:13,450 --> 00:53:15,940
Elections Canada I notice it everyone

1295
00:53:15,940 --> 00:53:17,470
already knows it's already all over the

1296
00:53:17,470 --> 00:53:19,150
news they're like yeah yeah we know we

1297
00:53:19,150 --> 00:53:22,510
know and by doing that by like kind of

1298
00:53:22,510 --> 00:53:24,760
like leaking your own information but

1299
00:53:24,760 --> 00:53:26,560
like officially and on purpose like you

1300
00:53:26,560 --> 00:53:28,600
end up with if people are upset that

1301
00:53:28,600 --> 00:53:30,370
like come to you sooner and you kind of

1302
00:53:30,370 --> 00:53:32,800
try to fix it I used to do that with pen

1303
00:53:32,800 --> 00:53:34,960
test results too I would tell the devs

1304
00:53:34,960 --> 00:53:38,500
first feel like I saw this thing can't

1305
00:53:38,500 --> 00:53:48,510
we talk yeah anyway Canadians

1306
00:53:48,510 --> 00:53:53,170
there's a lot we could learn probably so

1307
00:53:53,170 --> 00:53:55,420
we're getting close to time so I was

1308
00:53:55,420 --> 00:53:58,780
curious if there's a sort of like one

1309
00:53:58,780 --> 00:54:00,400
major thing that you think would be most

1310
00:54:00,400 --> 00:54:03,190
useful to lead people with like a

1311
00:54:03,190 --> 00:54:07,210
primary takeaway witticism turn of

1312
00:54:07,210 --> 00:54:08,290
phrase haiku

1313
00:54:08,290 --> 00:54:10,180
whatever you wish that you would like to

1314
00:54:10,180 --> 00:54:15,400
leave people with how's the thanks Doug

1315
00:54:15,400 --> 00:54:18,820
you had this you know I'm not - you know

1316
00:54:18,820 --> 00:54:20,830
spring moun I'm not too good at security

1317
00:54:20,830 --> 00:54:23,650
haikus but now I'm back with one for the

1318
00:54:23,650 --> 00:54:24,370
next panel

1319
00:54:24,370 --> 00:54:26,380
you had that one sonnet it's like saying

1320
00:54:26,380 --> 00:54:28,660
gosh well yeah yeah but there's not

1321
00:54:28,660 --> 00:54:30,700
nearly enough time for me to to get you

1322
00:54:30,700 --> 00:54:34,840
all if it's far too dense um I would say

1323
00:54:34,840 --> 00:54:37,180
you know like kind of I get I get from

1324
00:54:37,180 --> 00:54:38,770
the advice and suggestions side of

1325
00:54:38,770 --> 00:54:42,640
things um you know feel free to attack a

1326
00:54:42,640 --> 00:54:44,440
problem from a different angle you know

1327
00:54:44,440 --> 00:54:47,260
um a very basic example is like you know

1328
00:54:47,260 --> 00:54:50,920
rather than attempt to give this dog a

1329
00:54:50,920 --> 00:54:52,780
bad example from a former life but

1330
00:54:52,780 --> 00:54:53,110
rather than

1331
00:54:53,110 --> 00:54:56,530
try to like secure github access within

1332
00:54:56,530 --> 00:55:10,450
your organization the secret will never

1333
00:55:10,450 --> 00:55:15,610
find out never know while we're waiting

1334
00:55:15,610 --> 00:55:19,300
let's see Tanya do you wanna go next

1335
00:55:19,300 --> 00:55:22,900
door yeah I would say that if you are

1336
00:55:22,900 --> 00:55:26,170
going to do application security in a

1337
00:55:26,170 --> 00:55:28,780
devops environment go talk to Devon ops

1338
00:55:28,780 --> 00:55:30,910
learn their processes and then figure

1339
00:55:30,910 --> 00:55:34,210
out how you fit in as opposed to trying

1340
00:55:34,210 --> 00:55:36,850
to so whenever you build those things

1341
00:55:36,850 --> 00:55:40,420
like I've never had that work I've never

1342
00:55:40,420 --> 00:55:42,520
had that work well so it's dead going

1343
00:55:42,520 --> 00:55:44,350
over and talking introducing yourself

1344
00:55:44,350 --> 00:55:46,390
and then just being like so what tell me

1345
00:55:46,390 --> 00:55:50,879
your processes so I can see where I fit

1346
00:55:52,080 --> 00:56:09,160
everybody can't restart it now I think

1347
00:56:09,160 --> 00:56:11,650
the last thing I heard was rather than

1348
00:56:11,650 --> 00:56:31,060
trying to secure access to github gonna

1349
00:56:31,060 --> 00:56:32,320
make it less valuable you trying to

1350
00:56:32,320 --> 00:56:33,580
approach a problem from a different

1351
00:56:33,580 --> 00:56:34,270
angle

1352
00:56:34,270 --> 00:56:36,010
right and the other thing I was gonna

1353
00:56:36,010 --> 00:56:38,170
say was to gain visibility first and

1354
00:56:38,170 --> 00:56:40,660
then automate as much as possible so

1355
00:56:40,660 --> 00:56:42,730
provide that increased visibility like I

1356
00:56:42,730 --> 00:56:44,710
said from from people saw a point of

1357
00:56:44,710 --> 00:56:45,910
view as well as the technical side of

1358
00:56:45,910 --> 00:56:49,810
you side of things and then you know

1359
00:56:49,810 --> 00:56:52,840
just do your thing automate and and move

1360
00:56:52,840 --> 00:56:54,640
forward as fast as you can trying to

1361
00:56:54,640 --> 00:57:02,320
keep up yeah yeah I would say I guess

1362
00:57:02,320 --> 00:57:05,230
you know there's always gonna be bugs

1363
00:57:05,230 --> 00:57:06,970
there's always gonna be bad

1364
00:57:06,970 --> 00:57:08,620
things that happen I think what's really

1365
00:57:08,620 --> 00:57:11,710
important is how you respond and so

1366
00:57:11,710 --> 00:57:14,500
think about response think about your

1367
00:57:14,500 --> 00:57:15,760
response plants when you're building

1368
00:57:15,760 --> 00:57:17,830
things and think about what you're gonna

1369
00:57:17,830 --> 00:57:21,280
do if the bad thing happens and I think

1370
00:57:21,280 --> 00:57:24,190
that makes everybody's life a lot easier

1371
00:57:24,190 --> 00:57:29,320
so probably be with you said haiku let's

1372
00:57:29,320 --> 00:57:32,920
see I've got cherry blossoms fall be an

1373
00:57:32,920 --> 00:57:36,130
abler not blocker and I kind of get a

1374
00:57:36,130 --> 00:57:39,100
third line out of the haiku there but no

1375
00:57:39,100 --> 00:57:41,680
I think like exactly as everyone as

1376
00:57:41,680 --> 00:57:46,120
everyone said you know it security

1377
00:57:46,120 --> 00:57:48,700
historically has always fallen back to

1378
00:57:48,700 --> 00:57:51,240
saying no because it kind of worked both

1379
00:57:51,240 --> 00:57:53,440
technically and politically with how we

1380
00:57:53,440 --> 00:57:55,330
used to architects security teams and I

1381
00:57:55,330 --> 00:58:01,210
think recognize that that saying no in a

1382
00:58:01,210 --> 00:58:03,670
in the kind of environment that we all

1383
00:58:03,670 --> 00:58:06,910
live in now of cloud and DevOps and

1384
00:58:06,910 --> 00:58:09,760
moving much quicker it's going to cause

1385
00:58:09,760 --> 00:58:12,490
much more harm to the end state of

1386
00:58:12,490 --> 00:58:14,200
security that you want then you might

1387
00:58:14,200 --> 00:58:17,590
actually think and so recognizing ah you

1388
00:58:17,590 --> 00:58:19,360
know exactly as everyone said you know

1389
00:58:19,360 --> 00:58:21,910
how can how can we get visibility how

1390
00:58:21,910 --> 00:58:23,380
can we bring that to the application

1391
00:58:23,380 --> 00:58:25,450
teams and DevOps teams how can we find

1392
00:58:25,450 --> 00:58:27,370
ways to say yes how can we really like

1393
00:58:27,370 --> 00:58:29,380
to work with these teams and make the

1394
00:58:29,380 --> 00:58:31,450
default safe to use and everything there

1395
00:58:31,450 --> 00:58:33,130
it's a fundamental rethinking of how

1396
00:58:33,130 --> 00:58:34,810
we've done we've done security teams for

1397
00:58:34,810 --> 00:58:36,760
20 years 30 years like it's not easy

1398
00:58:36,760 --> 00:58:40,570
that's why we're all talking on pals and

1399
00:58:40,570 --> 00:58:42,070
sharing with our peers and everything

1400
00:58:42,070 --> 00:58:43,810
like that and I think that's that's

1401
00:58:43,810 --> 00:58:45,220
probably the final piece of advice I

1402
00:58:45,220 --> 00:58:48,160
give is reach out to your peers I don't

1403
00:58:48,160 --> 00:58:50,860
know a security practitioner on the

1404
00:58:50,860 --> 00:58:53,200
planet who isn't interested in chatting

1405
00:58:53,200 --> 00:58:55,180
with their peers even it was a cold

1406
00:58:55,180 --> 00:58:57,520
message on LinkedIn of just hey I'm

1407
00:58:57,520 --> 00:58:59,290
curious have you had this problem I'm

1408
00:58:59,290 --> 00:59:00,370
curious how you're approaching this

1409
00:59:00,370 --> 00:59:03,040
problem I think we all really are

1410
00:59:03,040 --> 00:59:05,500
interested in sharing lessons learned

1411
00:59:05,500 --> 00:59:07,720
with each other so please I would say

1412
00:59:07,720 --> 00:59:10,540
reach out to any of us reach out to

1413
00:59:10,540 --> 00:59:12,400
peers all of that

1414
00:59:12,400 --> 00:59:14,860
happy to help I made a hash tag for this

1415
00:59:14,860 --> 00:59:18,370
called ask InfoSec on Twitter awesome so

1416
00:59:18,370 --> 00:59:20,380
I just when people ask the random quest

1417
00:59:20,380 --> 00:59:22,119
and I tweet it and then people answer so

1418
00:59:22,119 --> 00:59:23,859
please feel free to just like use that

1419
00:59:23,859 --> 00:59:25,660
for anything and then people just

1420
00:59:25,660 --> 00:59:27,700
magically come and find you and then

1421
00:59:27,700 --> 00:59:29,559
give you answers it's awesome

1422
00:59:29,559 --> 00:59:32,680
who knew just like put it I have some in

1423
00:59:32,680 --> 00:59:35,579
front of things and their magic occurs

1424
00:59:35,579 --> 00:59:38,680
I'm gonna start hash tagging things with

1425
00:59:38,680 --> 00:59:42,489
security influencers I think that's

1426
00:59:42,489 --> 01:00:04,479
that's like I in retrospect I should

1427
01:00:04,479 --> 01:00:05,859
have thought of a haiku I was listening

1428
01:00:05,859 --> 01:00:08,739
Tony but I died I made a terrible

1429
01:00:08,739 --> 01:00:12,849
mistake but yeah III think echo what a

1430
01:00:12,849 --> 01:00:14,319
lot of people said I think building

1431
01:00:14,319 --> 01:00:16,930
relationships with development teams and

1432
01:00:16,930 --> 01:00:18,670
the rest of the organization the value

1433
01:00:18,670 --> 01:00:22,119
of that cannot be overstated I think

1434
01:00:22,119 --> 01:00:23,319
it's the difference between people

1435
01:00:23,319 --> 01:00:25,029
ignoring you and being like oh this is a

1436
01:00:25,029 --> 01:00:26,410
bit of friction but I'm willing to work

1437
01:00:26,410 --> 01:00:28,299
with you to make it better so I think

1438
01:00:28,299 --> 01:00:30,489
that's a huge deal and also when you are

1439
01:00:30,489 --> 01:00:32,650
choosing projects and things to work on

1440
01:00:32,650 --> 01:00:34,900
have a mind for the bigger picture like

1441
01:00:34,900 --> 01:00:36,849
will this make me like systematically

1442
01:00:36,849 --> 01:00:38,710
scale ibly better in the future or is it

1443
01:00:38,710 --> 01:00:40,269
just like fighting an immediate fire and

1444
01:00:40,269 --> 01:00:41,799
not making me long-term more effective

1445
01:00:41,799 --> 01:00:43,930
as a team so I think that's useful way

1446
01:00:43,930 --> 01:00:46,779
to think about it as well Ben thank you

1447
01:00:46,779 --> 01:00:49,420
so much for your time I had a blast

1448
01:00:49,420 --> 01:00:51,910
and thank you so much that's it con for

1449
01:00:51,910 --> 01:00:53,380
having us and throwing this wonderful

1450
01:00:53,380 --> 01:00:55,180
event and we'll see you on the interweb

1451
01:00:55,180 --> 01:00:58,109
soon hey Simon
