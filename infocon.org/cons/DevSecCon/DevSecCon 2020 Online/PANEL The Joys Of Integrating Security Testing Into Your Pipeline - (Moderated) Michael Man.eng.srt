1
00:00:01,310 --> 00:00:06,690
so my panelists welcome great so I guess

2
00:00:06,690 --> 00:00:10,469
it's our outer um so let's go around and

3
00:00:10,469 --> 00:00:13,019
do do some introductions so let's start

4
00:00:13,019 --> 00:00:16,650
with Wendy hi there my name is Wendy I'm

5
00:00:16,650 --> 00:00:20,490
currently the desktop managing advisor

6
00:00:20,490 --> 00:00:23,369
at Experian my background actually

7
00:00:23,369 --> 00:00:27,599
started off in infrastructure it

8
00:00:27,599 --> 00:00:30,599
networks as a network architect before

9
00:00:30,599 --> 00:00:35,489
moving into security and currently

10
00:00:35,489 --> 00:00:40,950
advising on a global transformation

11
00:00:40,950 --> 00:00:45,110
engagement for their cops for experience

12
00:00:45,110 --> 00:00:49,820
super great let's move over to Katie

13
00:00:49,820 --> 00:00:52,620
hello everyone my name is Katie Comanche

14
00:00:52,620 --> 00:00:54,149
and I am one of the cloud platform

15
00:00:54,149 --> 00:00:57,030
engineers for American Express as well

16
00:00:57,030 --> 00:00:58,770
you might know me in my capacity as one

17
00:00:58,770 --> 00:01:02,640
of the TLC for the Sims yeah and in that

18
00:01:02,640 --> 00:01:04,319
role I'm gonna focus a lot on the

19
00:01:04,319 --> 00:01:06,510
governance of open source projects and

20
00:01:06,510 --> 00:01:08,430
enabling projects to join the open

21
00:01:08,430 --> 00:01:10,770
source community as you noticed my role

22
00:01:10,770 --> 00:01:13,320
is not security focused I am here to

23
00:01:13,320 --> 00:01:16,259
actually give a an overview of the

24
00:01:16,259 --> 00:01:18,570
spectrum of how the security system by

25
00:01:18,570 --> 00:01:20,670
the end users so I'm gonna actually much

26
00:01:20,670 --> 00:01:25,189
share all the pains and all the kind of

27
00:01:25,189 --> 00:01:27,570
interaction and practices that we use on

28
00:01:27,570 --> 00:01:29,900
the on the other side of the security

29
00:01:29,900 --> 00:01:32,430
thank you we like to have a balanced

30
00:01:32,430 --> 00:01:37,220
view in the panel let's go over to Steve

31
00:01:37,220 --> 00:01:42,240
cool thanks Michael if I go way back I

32
00:01:42,240 --> 00:01:45,509
started as a seek coder and then from

33
00:01:45,509 --> 00:01:47,810
there I progressed through looking at

34
00:01:47,810 --> 00:01:50,610
process control process quality in

35
00:01:50,610 --> 00:01:53,159
manufacturing oddly and then code

36
00:01:53,159 --> 00:01:54,720
quality and then from code quality was

37
00:01:54,720 --> 00:01:56,040
kind of a natural step to get into

38
00:01:56,040 --> 00:01:58,259
security application security and now I

39
00:01:58,259 --> 00:02:00,350
focused primarily on the cloud native

40
00:02:00,350 --> 00:02:03,570
application security word of warning I

41
00:02:03,570 --> 00:02:04,939
work for vendor whooaaa

42
00:02:04,939 --> 00:02:09,810
so I'll bring that perspective we won't

43
00:02:09,810 --> 00:02:12,620
hold that against you Steve thank you

44
00:02:12,620 --> 00:02:14,430
grant would you like to introduce

45
00:02:14,430 --> 00:02:15,299
yourself

46
00:02:15,299 --> 00:02:19,530
sure hey everyone I'm grant yeah I come

47
00:02:19,530 --> 00:02:22,200
from a very secure security sighted

48
00:02:22,200 --> 00:02:25,859
perspective I worked in consultancy for

49
00:02:25,859 --> 00:02:28,290
many years now you know doing

50
00:02:28,290 --> 00:02:29,939
traditional activities like pen testing

51
00:02:29,939 --> 00:02:31,950
and a code review and that kind of stuff

52
00:02:31,950 --> 00:02:34,739
and more recently I've been working with

53
00:02:34,739 --> 00:02:37,290
non-secure as part of the the research

54
00:02:37,290 --> 00:02:39,060
team they're helping build solutions

55
00:02:39,060 --> 00:02:41,969
that do like CITV and SAST and DAST and

56
00:02:41,969 --> 00:02:44,639
other things so can I got a mixed bag of

57
00:02:44,639 --> 00:02:46,980
experience but certainly my backgrounds

58
00:02:46,980 --> 00:02:50,220
more on the offensive side and it's

59
00:02:50,220 --> 00:02:52,560
really useful to kind of see different

60
00:02:52,560 --> 00:02:54,209
perspectives now because historically

61
00:02:54,209 --> 00:02:56,280
there was always like an us-and-them and

62
00:02:56,280 --> 00:02:58,169
tolerate worse events like these

63
00:02:58,169 --> 00:02:59,639
showcase that like we can do really

64
00:02:59,639 --> 00:03:01,230
great things if we start working

65
00:03:01,230 --> 00:03:02,969
together so super excited to be here

66
00:03:02,969 --> 00:03:06,120
great thank you and over to my good

67
00:03:06,120 --> 00:03:09,329
friend Ashraf hey Michael thank you so

68
00:03:09,329 --> 00:03:11,430
yeah I'm currently working Roeder's as

69
00:03:11,430 --> 00:03:13,079
the global head of security architecture

70
00:03:13,079 --> 00:03:15,750
operations and engineering so I've got a

71
00:03:15,750 --> 00:03:19,049
very wide remit background technical

72
00:03:19,049 --> 00:03:22,349
background started up now xqe a bit of

73
00:03:22,349 --> 00:03:25,319
been testing cyber consultancy I've been

74
00:03:25,319 --> 00:03:27,870
involved in the response to large-scale

75
00:03:27,870 --> 00:03:31,109
attacks and incident responses clients

76
00:03:31,109 --> 00:03:33,449
such as TalkTalk and Swift Bangladeshi

77
00:03:33,449 --> 00:03:36,090
highest etc so I've had a good good

78
00:03:36,090 --> 00:03:37,699
experience from what the lack of

79
00:03:37,699 --> 00:03:41,609
security an organization does so yeah so

80
00:03:41,609 --> 00:03:43,769
I can give maybe some some little

81
00:03:43,769 --> 00:03:47,489
stories maybe that's great and a quick

82
00:03:47,489 --> 00:03:49,799
intro to introduction of myself so I

83
00:03:49,799 --> 00:03:51,840
mean obviously mentioned that I'm the

84
00:03:51,840 --> 00:03:54,449
founder and organize a organizer for

85
00:03:54,449 --> 00:03:55,859
their circuits London gavurin

86
00:03:55,859 --> 00:03:58,680
I'm also a independent consultant

87
00:03:58,680 --> 00:04:03,120
working with a lot of 4,100 clients to

88
00:04:03,120 --> 00:04:06,359
factor in security torian's and security

89
00:04:06,359 --> 00:04:09,930
into their delivery lifecycle so on that

90
00:04:09,930 --> 00:04:12,689
note thank you everybody

91
00:04:12,689 --> 00:04:14,939
and thank you for the Def Con for

92
00:04:14,939 --> 00:04:18,209
inviting us where the European panel I

93
00:04:18,209 --> 00:04:21,599
was asked to may give the panel a title

94
00:04:21,599 --> 00:04:23,789
so I quickly came up with the joys of

95
00:04:23,789 --> 00:04:25,810
integrating security testing

96
00:04:25,810 --> 00:04:28,630
into your pipeline I think one of you

97
00:04:28,630 --> 00:04:32,230
guys said there was a hint of sarcasm in

98
00:04:32,230 --> 00:04:35,520
that title and and you're probably right

99
00:04:35,520 --> 00:04:41,530
so as the title mentions pipeline one of

100
00:04:41,530 --> 00:04:43,389
the first points I would like to talk

101
00:04:43,389 --> 00:04:46,780
about is the term pipeline so you hear

102
00:04:46,780 --> 00:04:48,820
this a lot within our industry within

103
00:04:48,820 --> 00:04:51,790
companies and I think there's a lot of

104
00:04:51,790 --> 00:04:55,510
different meaning or definition of that

105
00:04:55,510 --> 00:04:59,290
term so a lot of people feel that the

106
00:04:59,290 --> 00:05:02,889
pipeline is actually just the technical

107
00:05:02,889 --> 00:05:06,490
aspect of your CI part so for example

108
00:05:06,490 --> 00:05:08,229
Jenkins which is kind of the glue that

109
00:05:08,229 --> 00:05:10,540
would orchestrate all your build and

110
00:05:10,540 --> 00:05:13,630
testing etc that's the pipeline but does

111
00:05:13,630 --> 00:05:16,180
it is that the true meaning of pipeline

112
00:05:16,180 --> 00:05:17,590
personally I think it should be a bit

113
00:05:17,590 --> 00:05:19,930
broader if we factor in security it's

114
00:05:19,930 --> 00:05:21,940
not just about the tech so therefore

115
00:05:21,940 --> 00:05:25,000
your pipeline can't be just about the

116
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:27,460
co-promotion building compilation

117
00:05:27,460 --> 00:05:30,760
testing aspect it should really start

118
00:05:30,760 --> 00:05:35,470
from the business conception of an idea

119
00:05:35,470 --> 00:05:38,110
all the way to delivering that to your

120
00:05:38,110 --> 00:05:41,080
customers but that's my view what do you

121
00:05:41,080 --> 00:05:44,830
think ashraf yeah this this is tara

122
00:05:44,830 --> 00:05:45,729
quite a bit

123
00:05:45,729 --> 00:05:47,320
build pipeline everyone has their own

124
00:05:47,320 --> 00:05:49,090
definition so for me if we're referring

125
00:05:49,090 --> 00:05:51,970
to application security then build

126
00:05:51,970 --> 00:05:54,280
pipeline in my eyes should and could

127
00:05:54,280 --> 00:05:56,560
encumber source software security tests

128
00:05:56,560 --> 00:05:59,169
if possible if we look into shift left

129
00:05:59,169 --> 00:06:01,210
with respect to security as a whole then

130
00:06:01,210 --> 00:06:02,800
the build pipeline is somewhat too late

131
00:06:02,800 --> 00:06:05,020
as you saying you kind of you've skipped

132
00:06:05,020 --> 00:06:06,880
the design and phase and the the

133
00:06:06,880 --> 00:06:09,700
business objectives and requirements etc

134
00:06:09,700 --> 00:06:11,520
so you're only focusing purely on

135
00:06:11,520 --> 00:06:13,990
whatever what can be tested within the

136
00:06:13,990 --> 00:06:16,150
build pipeline so and if you do that

137
00:06:16,150 --> 00:06:18,280
there could be design decisions that can

138
00:06:18,280 --> 00:06:19,630
have adverse effect on the defense

139
00:06:19,630 --> 00:06:22,090
ability of the application so and then

140
00:06:22,090 --> 00:06:23,560
in order for you to go back and change

141
00:06:23,560 --> 00:06:25,389
that you're going to slow down the

142
00:06:25,389 --> 00:06:27,760
product projects and then your Secura

143
00:06:27,760 --> 00:06:28,930
are going to become the handbrake crew

144
00:06:28,930 --> 00:06:32,440
as we are formerly known as so you know

145
00:06:32,440 --> 00:06:34,510
not all security tests can be defined as

146
00:06:34,510 --> 00:06:37,720
code or should I say not all screech is

147
00:06:37,720 --> 00:06:39,639
not it's not that easy to define also

148
00:06:39,639 --> 00:06:42,999
test his code so so the bill pipeline is

149
00:06:42,999 --> 00:06:45,789
not necessarily the path to go live okay

150
00:06:45,789 --> 00:06:48,400
it's it's a series of sets purely aimed

151
00:06:48,400 --> 00:06:52,629
at software delivery houses and and I

152
00:06:52,629 --> 00:06:54,460
think there are a lot of companies out

153
00:06:54,460 --> 00:06:56,979
there a lot of institutions out there

154
00:06:56,979 --> 00:06:58,449
that maybe don't actually build a lot

155
00:06:58,449 --> 00:07:00,099
our software in-house and they're trying

156
00:07:00,099 --> 00:07:03,039
to do that you know see ICD DevOps dev

157
00:07:03,039 --> 00:07:04,150
set cops and they're trying to figure

158
00:07:04,150 --> 00:07:05,710
out how can we join them in all these

159
00:07:05,710 --> 00:07:06,310
buzzwords

160
00:07:06,310 --> 00:07:07,810
but they can't because they're not

161
00:07:07,810 --> 00:07:09,490
developing any software so they're

162
00:07:09,490 --> 00:07:12,430
really trying to like desperately trying

163
00:07:12,430 --> 00:07:13,779
to squeeze some of this stuff and then

164
00:07:13,779 --> 00:07:15,669
of course you can then I think there's a

165
00:07:15,669 --> 00:07:17,949
lot of people so going to use it as well

166
00:07:17,949 --> 00:07:19,779
okay we're gonna put our configures code

167
00:07:19,779 --> 00:07:21,610
through our build pipeline and then our

168
00:07:21,610 --> 00:07:23,500
infrastructure as code and that's where

169
00:07:23,500 --> 00:07:24,580
you're starting to get a little bit more

170
00:07:24,580 --> 00:07:26,860
now in terms of actually requirements

171
00:07:26,860 --> 00:07:30,340
and security testers code so for me it's

172
00:07:30,340 --> 00:07:31,539
it's a build pipeline it's not

173
00:07:31,539 --> 00:07:32,919
necessarily the path to live so that's

174
00:07:32,919 --> 00:07:35,680
my interpretation of it and and I and I

175
00:07:35,680 --> 00:07:38,650
think it's it's not it's um you might

176
00:07:38,650 --> 00:07:40,960
you might feel a bit hard done by if

177
00:07:40,960 --> 00:07:42,879
you've you followed your build pipeline

178
00:07:42,879 --> 00:07:44,800
and everything's you know going

179
00:07:44,800 --> 00:07:47,080
hunky-dory and then you want to go live

180
00:07:47,080 --> 00:07:49,779
and then security guy or risk guy says

181
00:07:49,779 --> 00:07:52,210
no no no sorry yeah we're not finished

182
00:07:52,210 --> 00:07:53,560
yet you still got this big long

183
00:07:53,560 --> 00:07:56,409
checklist to go live so I I see it from

184
00:07:56,409 --> 00:07:59,080
both both from a developer security

185
00:07:59,080 --> 00:08:01,479
business products owner perspective but

186
00:08:01,479 --> 00:08:02,979
there's still a lot to be done and

187
00:08:02,979 --> 00:08:04,419
you've got to be careful what you wish

188
00:08:04,419 --> 00:08:06,550
for because if you do want everything to

189
00:08:06,550 --> 00:08:09,009
find this code and and you want all your

190
00:08:09,009 --> 00:08:11,169
tests to find us code then essentially

191
00:08:11,169 --> 00:08:13,899
you're building up a set of patterns so

192
00:08:13,899 --> 00:08:15,370
therefore we can write that security

193
00:08:15,370 --> 00:08:17,080
testers code and therefore you're going

194
00:08:17,080 --> 00:08:20,279
to be put probably pigeon-holed into a

195
00:08:20,279 --> 00:08:22,930
finite set of patterns and so that we

196
00:08:22,930 --> 00:08:25,719
can test you against so I think I don't

197
00:08:25,719 --> 00:08:27,159
know if actually we want to put

198
00:08:27,159 --> 00:08:29,860
everything all security test this code

199
00:08:29,860 --> 00:08:32,500
so that that's we know people might not

200
00:08:32,500 --> 00:08:34,570
agree with me there mmm

201
00:08:34,570 --> 00:08:37,059
interesting interesting Steve do you

202
00:08:37,059 --> 00:08:41,529
have an opinion on this yeah it's right

203
00:08:41,529 --> 00:08:45,540
I I'll start with saying I agree there

204
00:08:45,540 --> 00:08:48,910
but I think there's yeah it's early in

205
00:08:48,910 --> 00:08:51,910
the panel so let's be positive so the

206
00:08:51,910 --> 00:08:52,870
pipeline for me

207
00:08:52,870 --> 00:08:53,470
the two

208
00:08:53,470 --> 00:08:55,990
way big step back is kind of all where

209
00:08:55,990 --> 00:08:57,580
all the business touch points approach

210
00:08:57,580 --> 00:08:59,290
getting from software to its inception

211
00:08:59,290 --> 00:09:01,480
to its deployment and there can be a lot

212
00:09:01,480 --> 00:09:02,950
of touch points around that where you

213
00:09:02,950 --> 00:09:05,290
need to apply security both in terms of

214
00:09:05,290 --> 00:09:07,330
automating tests but also in terms of as

215
00:09:07,330 --> 00:09:09,010
you said design because design is kind

216
00:09:09,010 --> 00:09:11,650
of where well I'll say both there's an

217
00:09:11,650 --> 00:09:12,580
argument about how much how many

218
00:09:12,580 --> 00:09:14,470
software security defects enter by

219
00:09:14,470 --> 00:09:16,240
design and how much are a result of

220
00:09:16,240 --> 00:09:18,400
actual code defects but I think

221
00:09:18,400 --> 00:09:20,770
automation adds the velocity to that

222
00:09:20,770 --> 00:09:22,390
pipeline but I think the pipeline can be

223
00:09:22,390 --> 00:09:23,980
in my mind drawn it as something that's

224
00:09:23,980 --> 00:09:25,270
actually quite large within an

225
00:09:25,270 --> 00:09:31,500
organization super it could be so

226
00:09:31,500 --> 00:09:34,390
pipeline value stream mapping is another

227
00:09:34,390 --> 00:09:36,400
term that came to my head and that's

228
00:09:36,400 --> 00:09:39,220
probably a could be used as a better

229
00:09:39,220 --> 00:09:41,920
term to describe the whole end-to-end

230
00:09:41,920 --> 00:09:46,500
process so regarding deficit cops and

231
00:09:46,500 --> 00:09:49,090
people talk about it people talk about

232
00:09:49,090 --> 00:09:52,390
how to integrate it as if it was a

233
00:09:52,390 --> 00:09:55,990
tangible thing but how would we measure

234
00:09:55,990 --> 00:10:00,940
this or articulate the the journey ok

235
00:10:00,940 --> 00:10:02,890
Katie would you like to share some

236
00:10:02,890 --> 00:10:07,440
thoughts on this absolutely I think

237
00:10:07,440 --> 00:10:10,780
measuring how well we do security in any

238
00:10:10,780 --> 00:10:13,450
company it's quite a complicated thing

239
00:10:13,450 --> 00:10:15,100
but I think when it comes to security

240
00:10:15,100 --> 00:10:19,750
the main principle is how quickly we can

241
00:10:19,750 --> 00:10:21,880
fix a vulnerability so it's pretty much

242
00:10:21,880 --> 00:10:23,830
can be translated in the mean time to

243
00:10:23,830 --> 00:10:26,290
fix if you find an issue how quickly can

244
00:10:26,290 --> 00:10:28,450
you fix it and this is pretty much just

245
00:10:28,450 --> 00:10:30,820
the surface the tip of the iceberg

246
00:10:30,820 --> 00:10:33,070
because underneath that it's a whole

247
00:10:33,070 --> 00:10:36,610
kind of cultural shift it's an entire

248
00:10:36,610 --> 00:10:38,590
different part I like when it comes to

249
00:10:38,590 --> 00:10:40,150
how we share information how into

250
00:10:40,150 --> 00:10:42,610
coaching and training so one of the

251
00:10:42,610 --> 00:10:44,770
things which is quite important in how

252
00:10:44,770 --> 00:10:46,960
quickly we can think fix things is

253
00:10:46,960 --> 00:10:49,480
automation do we actually have this and

254
00:10:49,480 --> 00:10:52,630
to enter in instrumentation possible how

255
00:10:52,630 --> 00:10:55,660
much of all the security issues did we

256
00:10:55,660 --> 00:10:58,600
did we kind of cover how much of it did

257
00:10:58,600 --> 00:11:03,280
we cover it in encode as well and the

258
00:11:03,280 --> 00:11:05,560
other thing is the confidence of

259
00:11:05,560 --> 00:11:06,240
engineer

260
00:11:06,240 --> 00:11:08,670
of actually jumping into security and

261
00:11:08,670 --> 00:11:10,980
Asian fixing it and I think this

262
00:11:10,980 --> 00:11:12,899
confidence is coming obviously way for

263
00:11:12,899 --> 00:11:14,790
the experience or the knowledge of the

264
00:11:14,790 --> 00:11:16,350
system my challenge is standing what

265
00:11:16,350 --> 00:11:19,529
you're designing why you just like what

266
00:11:19,529 --> 00:11:23,069
kind of is going to be your end and end

267
00:11:23,069 --> 00:11:24,689
users who are designing it for as well

268
00:11:24,689 --> 00:11:28,290
so I think it's all about the even if

269
00:11:28,290 --> 00:11:29,850
you don't have the knowledge how can you

270
00:11:29,850 --> 00:11:31,290
actually have this collaboration between

271
00:11:31,290 --> 00:11:34,019
your team and the security team how can

272
00:11:34,019 --> 00:11:35,220
you have this coaching and

273
00:11:35,220 --> 00:11:36,959
cross-pollination so I think this is

274
00:11:36,959 --> 00:11:38,639
again something which kind of happens

275
00:11:38,639 --> 00:11:40,559
underneath but again how efficiently you

276
00:11:40,559 --> 00:11:44,009
can do that can determine the way you're

277
00:11:44,009 --> 00:11:45,569
actually gonna fix and make your system

278
00:11:45,569 --> 00:11:47,759
more kind of bulletproof you know way

279
00:11:47,759 --> 00:11:51,569
and I would like to say that this kind

280
00:11:51,569 --> 00:11:53,910
of brings me to one of the metrics which

281
00:11:53,910 --> 00:11:56,249
is difficult to to measure to quantify

282
00:11:56,249 --> 00:11:59,429
but it's how well we actually distribute

283
00:11:59,429 --> 00:12:02,480
the ownership of security because if

284
00:12:02,480 --> 00:12:04,889
suppose a different team or have an

285
00:12:04,889 --> 00:12:08,100
owner ability being announced for

286
00:12:08,100 --> 00:12:10,980
example how how exactly we jump into

287
00:12:10,980 --> 00:12:13,189
these this problem is it one team

288
00:12:13,189 --> 00:12:16,619
dictating to us do we need to do like

289
00:12:16,619 --> 00:12:18,600
doing it to kind of fix it is there

290
00:12:18,600 --> 00:12:20,490
going to open taken an hour backlog and

291
00:12:20,490 --> 00:12:21,809
is going to take a lot of time to

292
00:12:21,809 --> 00:12:23,429
prioritize it and so forth and so forth

293
00:12:23,429 --> 00:12:26,459
or me as an infrastructure engineer I am

294
00:12:26,459 --> 00:12:28,889
aware of my products I'm aware of the

295
00:12:28,889 --> 00:12:31,799
tools I'm running onto my platform and I

296
00:12:31,799 --> 00:12:34,319
am kind of always constantly monitoring

297
00:12:34,319 --> 00:12:36,509
and being proactive about discovering

298
00:12:36,509 --> 00:12:38,879
these issues and actually solving them I

299
00:12:38,879 --> 00:12:40,889
think this kind of distribution of

300
00:12:40,889 --> 00:12:43,290
ownership when it comes to security it

301
00:12:43,290 --> 00:12:47,490
comes again with well again very

302
00:12:47,490 --> 00:12:49,230
difficult to quantify but it's the

303
00:12:49,230 --> 00:12:51,629
culture which once engrained is going to

304
00:12:51,629 --> 00:12:53,999
bring a lot of benefits towards the the

305
00:12:53,999 --> 00:12:57,509
entire system in the entire company wow

306
00:12:57,509 --> 00:13:01,049
that's very deep anything else to add

307
00:13:01,049 --> 00:13:05,670
extra from on this point yeah I would

308
00:13:05,670 --> 00:13:08,670
say the easiest way to measure is how

309
00:13:08,670 --> 00:13:10,920
painful is it really you know how

310
00:13:10,920 --> 00:13:12,480
painful is it for the developers and how

311
00:13:12,480 --> 00:13:15,240
painful is it for you if you work in the

312
00:13:15,240 --> 00:13:18,529
those security teams to

313
00:13:18,529 --> 00:13:21,649
to deal with your counterparts it I

314
00:13:21,649 --> 00:13:25,100
think it's easy it's very very easy you

315
00:13:25,100 --> 00:13:26,990
know when you've got it right yeah so

316
00:13:26,990 --> 00:13:29,329
you know when you've got it wrong it's

317
00:13:29,329 --> 00:13:33,230
it's a show people people hate take

318
00:13:33,230 --> 00:13:36,680
doing the security tests they they fight

319
00:13:36,680 --> 00:13:37,189
you

320
00:13:37,189 --> 00:13:39,740
they blame you but when you've got it

321
00:13:39,740 --> 00:13:41,360
right you've actually been pulled into

322
00:13:41,360 --> 00:13:44,059
the conversations you're being you you

323
00:13:44,059 --> 00:13:46,430
can actually put your tools in in in in

324
00:13:46,430 --> 00:13:48,800
the critical path you can force it as a

325
00:13:48,800 --> 00:13:50,899
build step and then you go okay well are

326
00:13:50,899 --> 00:13:52,910
we gonna go soft or hard gates again

327
00:13:52,910 --> 00:13:54,230
talking about from a software

328
00:13:54,230 --> 00:13:55,309
development lifecycle and a build

329
00:13:55,309 --> 00:13:58,069
pipeline once you once you once you're

330
00:13:58,069 --> 00:14:00,199
there and you say okay well you need to

331
00:14:00,199 --> 00:14:04,069
do these tests before you go live and

332
00:14:04,069 --> 00:14:05,839
you can you can actually as as a

333
00:14:05,839 --> 00:14:07,550
security team or as an organization I'd

334
00:14:07,550 --> 00:14:09,589
say you say write everything that goes

335
00:14:09,589 --> 00:14:11,420
lives we run it through a set of

336
00:14:11,420 --> 00:14:12,680
security tests and if it fails it

337
00:14:12,680 --> 00:14:14,199
doesn't go live and as simple as that

338
00:14:14,199 --> 00:14:16,730
you're doing really go really really

339
00:14:16,730 --> 00:14:18,050
well there and I think you've got an

340
00:14:18,050 --> 00:14:19,670
incredibly good good and sure to sign us

341
00:14:19,670 --> 00:14:21,019
up but I don't think there's many people

342
00:14:21,019 --> 00:14:23,509
doing that and one thing I'd also say is

343
00:14:23,509 --> 00:14:26,899
that I think as we're talking about this

344
00:14:26,899 --> 00:14:30,559
kind of a collective responsibility we

345
00:14:30,559 --> 00:14:33,829
need to probably stop selecting security

346
00:14:33,829 --> 00:14:37,910
tools on our own as if it's a product

347
00:14:37,910 --> 00:14:41,300
just for us in fact we are selecting a

348
00:14:41,300 --> 00:14:42,170
product that we're going to measure

349
00:14:42,170 --> 00:14:43,579
somebody against and we're not giving

350
00:14:43,579 --> 00:14:46,189
them the the the inclusion that they

351
00:14:46,189 --> 00:14:48,949
need so we we might end up selecting

352
00:14:48,949 --> 00:14:51,079
something that isn't fit for purpose and

353
00:14:51,079 --> 00:14:52,939
then tell them to use it and then

354
00:14:52,939 --> 00:14:54,889
they're going to complain about it isn't

355
00:14:54,889 --> 00:14:56,779
the purpose and then we're gonna say

356
00:14:56,779 --> 00:14:59,600
well yeah that's your problem you've got

357
00:14:59,600 --> 00:15:01,730
to figure out so I I think there's yeah

358
00:15:01,730 --> 00:15:03,079
there's a lot to talk about this even

359
00:15:03,079 --> 00:15:05,000
before we get into maturity so and

360
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:07,670
everybody is you know we're not a single

361
00:15:07,670 --> 00:15:10,629
glove fits all so it's is a big topic

362
00:15:10,629 --> 00:15:14,860
Wow okay say let's use us nicely on two

363
00:15:14,860 --> 00:15:17,449
guidelines so are there any guidelines

364
00:15:17,449 --> 00:15:20,929
for selecting tools Katie do you want to

365
00:15:20,929 --> 00:15:25,490
take this again sure I think the main

366
00:15:25,490 --> 00:15:28,579
guidelines in selecting any tools is to

367
00:15:28,579 --> 00:15:30,079
action or does it fix the problem

368
00:15:30,079 --> 00:15:31,579
there's the main question I think it's

369
00:15:31,579 --> 00:15:31,860
very

370
00:15:31,860 --> 00:15:33,540
working to have a predefined set of

371
00:15:33,540 --> 00:15:35,550
requirements to actually understand what

372
00:15:35,550 --> 00:15:37,920
you're trying to solve and try to find a

373
00:15:37,920 --> 00:15:41,130
tool that's gonna match most of a the

374
00:15:41,130 --> 00:15:42,959
issues almost don't think things are

375
00:15:42,959 --> 00:15:45,269
trying to fix and when it comes

376
00:15:45,269 --> 00:15:47,519
something to security I think because

377
00:15:47,519 --> 00:15:50,160
it's such a complex topic from my

378
00:15:50,160 --> 00:15:50,970
perspective from the end-user

379
00:15:50,970 --> 00:15:52,980
perspective let's say as a platform

380
00:15:52,980 --> 00:15:54,690
engineer I have to deal with security I

381
00:15:54,690 --> 00:15:56,459
have to integrate it within three thin

382
00:15:56,459 --> 00:15:58,950
infrastructure I think one of the most

383
00:15:58,950 --> 00:16:01,110
important thing from our interview is

384
00:16:01,110 --> 00:16:03,930
accuracy like we really want something

385
00:16:03,930 --> 00:16:06,510
which is actually gonna find the problem

386
00:16:06,510 --> 00:16:07,980
in most of the cases rather than

387
00:16:07,980 --> 00:16:10,620
creating a lot of spam into our channels

388
00:16:10,620 --> 00:16:12,540
creating a lot of alarms and we're just

389
00:16:12,540 --> 00:16:14,940
gonna be all over like that's false

390
00:16:14,940 --> 00:16:16,980
positives is the nightmare of any

391
00:16:16,980 --> 00:16:18,930
engineer nowadays like no one wants that

392
00:16:18,930 --> 00:16:21,390
so I think if you find a tool that

393
00:16:21,390 --> 00:16:25,410
really can do something really good like

394
00:16:25,410 --> 00:16:27,269
even if it's a small subset even just

395
00:16:27,269 --> 00:16:29,760
like fixes very like maybe I would say

396
00:16:29,760 --> 00:16:31,980
maybe 40% but he doesn't very well I'd

397
00:16:31,980 --> 00:16:33,959
prefer that rather than having a tool

398
00:16:33,959 --> 00:16:37,290
which is gonna fire alarms all the time

399
00:16:37,290 --> 00:16:40,560
and another thing which I think it's

400
00:16:40,560 --> 00:16:41,910
quite important when we're talking about

401
00:16:41,910 --> 00:16:45,000
tooling and security is does it actually

402
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:50,100
make my deployment process or my mine

403
00:16:50,100 --> 00:16:51,480
stage from being to my local environment

404
00:16:51,480 --> 00:16:54,510
to production quicker or slower because

405
00:16:54,510 --> 00:16:56,100
if it's gonna be a tool which is gonna

406
00:16:56,100 --> 00:16:58,110
bring a lot of complexity which is gonna

407
00:16:58,110 --> 00:16:59,910
fail my pipeline for example and I need

408
00:16:59,910 --> 00:17:02,010
to spend maybe two days let's exaggerate

409
00:17:02,010 --> 00:17:04,079
it obviously anything if I have to spend

410
00:17:04,079 --> 00:17:06,630
one hour two hours and deep diving into

411
00:17:06,630 --> 00:17:09,179
something maybe which is like a very

412
00:17:09,179 --> 00:17:11,069
small patch like a very small kind of

413
00:17:11,069 --> 00:17:12,540
thing we don't really mean we're

414
00:17:12,540 --> 00:17:14,549
concerned about that but we don't really

415
00:17:14,549 --> 00:17:16,619
want to kind of push back the entire

416
00:17:16,619 --> 00:17:18,689
deployment process because of it it's

417
00:17:18,689 --> 00:17:20,520
it's all about like how can you measure

418
00:17:20,520 --> 00:17:22,980
if it's actually making us efficient I

419
00:17:22,980 --> 00:17:25,709
think like this is in terms of kind of

420
00:17:25,709 --> 00:17:29,820
the practices another thing is obviously

421
00:17:29,820 --> 00:17:31,740
want to choosing the tolling it's I

422
00:17:31,740 --> 00:17:33,480
think the question do we build it

423
00:17:33,480 --> 00:17:35,790
in-house or do we pay for it do it from

424
00:17:35,790 --> 00:17:38,429
money or the problem and I think this I

425
00:17:38,429 --> 00:17:40,919
think lately at least from from my

426
00:17:40,919 --> 00:17:42,870
experience what I've seen a lot of

427
00:17:42,870 --> 00:17:45,600
companies do they actually do prefer

428
00:17:45,600 --> 00:17:47,270
you get an of the shelf product

429
00:17:47,270 --> 00:17:49,980
obviously if it's got again based on the

430
00:17:49,980 --> 00:17:52,260
requirements anything they solve most of

431
00:17:52,260 --> 00:17:53,580
the problems they're gonna go for that

432
00:17:53,580 --> 00:17:55,130
because it's quite difficult to actually

433
00:17:55,130 --> 00:17:57,900
get this knowledge in the resources to

434
00:17:57,900 --> 00:17:59,640
build a children house the maintaining

435
00:17:59,640 --> 00:18:01,710
unless you're a security company which

436
00:18:01,710 --> 00:18:04,700
is actually a full-time job and I think

437
00:18:04,700 --> 00:18:09,440
this kind of kind of covers most of the

438
00:18:09,440 --> 00:18:13,940
the guidelines maybe ones using the tool

439
00:18:13,940 --> 00:18:17,100
great I would move to Steve on this

440
00:18:17,100 --> 00:18:18,960
point but I won't

441
00:18:18,960 --> 00:18:22,080
I mean Wendy would you like to share

442
00:18:22,080 --> 00:18:24,080
some of your experience around

443
00:18:24,080 --> 00:18:29,880
guidelines and tool selections you're on

444
00:18:29,880 --> 00:18:34,230
mute sure thank you for that so very

445
00:18:34,230 --> 00:18:36,500
timely conversation actually we we just

446
00:18:36,500 --> 00:18:41,100
as part of our transformation we are

447
00:18:41,100 --> 00:18:43,770
actually actively doing tool selection

448
00:18:43,770 --> 00:18:46,530
and I think Katie's comments regarding

449
00:18:46,530 --> 00:18:49,440
the requirements I think starting off

450
00:18:49,440 --> 00:18:52,110
with a set of requirements for your

451
00:18:52,110 --> 00:18:55,080
organization for your developers for

452
00:18:55,080 --> 00:18:57,120
your management team is absolutely

453
00:18:57,120 --> 00:18:59,340
critical I mean I think just an analogy

454
00:18:59,340 --> 00:19:01,440
we I think we probably all done it right

455
00:19:01,440 --> 00:19:03,990
so it is sort of you know going to the

456
00:19:03,990 --> 00:19:05,429
supermarket you know you've got all of

457
00:19:05,429 --> 00:19:06,870
your oldest goods you go to a

458
00:19:06,870 --> 00:19:09,210
supermarket with a shopping list of what

459
00:19:09,210 --> 00:19:11,429
you need or you go to a supermarket when

460
00:19:11,429 --> 00:19:13,350
you're hungry because that's when you

461
00:19:13,350 --> 00:19:15,000
you know you actually have a need for

462
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:17,190
this but it goes it so it's going to a

463
00:19:17,190 --> 00:19:18,960
supermarket when you're hungry and then

464
00:19:18,960 --> 00:19:20,909
essentially just grabbing everything

465
00:19:20,909 --> 00:19:22,530
that you have on site so I think

466
00:19:22,530 --> 00:19:26,039
starting off with with the requirements

467
00:19:26,039 --> 00:19:28,710
do it you know do your due diligence go

468
00:19:28,710 --> 00:19:31,950
through a proper Rp process and then

469
00:19:31,950 --> 00:19:37,400
sort of and and do sort of a kind of

470
00:19:37,400 --> 00:19:42,020
measured selection process through pocs

471
00:19:42,020 --> 00:19:45,659
and the like is it's quite critical to

472
00:19:45,659 --> 00:19:49,530
make sure that your tool set fits your

473
00:19:49,530 --> 00:19:51,539
purpose especially if we are trying to

474
00:19:51,539 --> 00:19:54,690
do they're cops so I think you know

475
00:19:54,690 --> 00:19:57,940
they're copies sort of reasonably new

476
00:19:57,940 --> 00:20:00,519
going to get any kind of you know sort

477
00:20:00,519 --> 00:20:03,519
of minoo compared to devops right

478
00:20:03,519 --> 00:20:05,230
they've got been around for I don't know

479
00:20:05,230 --> 00:20:07,539
but so to that ten years so it's a

480
00:20:07,539 --> 00:20:09,340
concept that I would understand I think

481
00:20:09,340 --> 00:20:12,129
previously we had a there box and then

482
00:20:12,129 --> 00:20:15,429
we have apps SEC so security is very

483
00:20:15,429 --> 00:20:17,529
much you know as long as we get it you

484
00:20:17,529 --> 00:20:20,830
know we get it we have a security scan

485
00:20:20,830 --> 00:20:23,710
all sorts then we're done but with death

486
00:20:23,710 --> 00:20:25,179
set cops you've basically trying to

487
00:20:25,179 --> 00:20:27,789
apply those DevOps principle to security

488
00:20:27,789 --> 00:20:30,129
so incremental scan scan as early as

489
00:20:30,129 --> 00:20:32,440
possible development in your code about

490
00:20:32,440 --> 00:20:34,870
them and as well as doing threat

491
00:20:34,870 --> 00:20:36,909
modeling before you know in the planning

492
00:20:36,909 --> 00:20:39,039
stage so you're just basically trying to

493
00:20:39,039 --> 00:20:41,950
do everything incremental e and sort of

494
00:20:41,950 --> 00:20:46,120
less painful in a less painful way hmm

495
00:20:46,120 --> 00:20:49,929
okay almost feels very water fully in

496
00:20:49,929 --> 00:20:51,639
terms of talk to all in selection net

497
00:20:51,639 --> 00:20:55,929
with rfp's POV requirements etc but it

498
00:20:55,929 --> 00:20:58,360
kind of makes sense and when it does

499
00:20:58,360 --> 00:21:01,120
make sense for large organizations there

500
00:21:01,120 --> 00:21:03,700
are guidance procurement guide

501
00:21:03,700 --> 00:21:06,070
guidelines that we need to follow you

502
00:21:06,070 --> 00:21:08,950
know scalability in terms of purchasing

503
00:21:08,950 --> 00:21:10,690
commercial products it's all very

504
00:21:10,690 --> 00:21:14,980
important if we select ten different

505
00:21:14,980 --> 00:21:18,429
commercial products we but actually one

506
00:21:18,429 --> 00:21:21,820
of them at meets 80% of our requirements

507
00:21:21,820 --> 00:21:24,519
that's kind of Katie alluded to then why

508
00:21:24,519 --> 00:21:26,830
not do that and from a licensing point

509
00:21:26,830 --> 00:21:29,740
of view we weaken that will scale much

510
00:21:29,740 --> 00:21:33,429
better so kind of on the tool testing

511
00:21:33,429 --> 00:21:36,720
tool inside of things obviously

512
00:21:36,720 --> 00:21:39,549
traditionally we've had within security

513
00:21:39,549 --> 00:21:42,129
different types of testing approaches

514
00:21:42,129 --> 00:21:44,919
etc and methodology so static an

515
00:21:44,919 --> 00:21:46,750
analysis that's been around for years

516
00:21:46,750 --> 00:21:52,149
right but do you think those approaches

517
00:21:52,149 --> 00:21:55,389
actually work within the DevOps they've

518
00:21:55,389 --> 00:21:58,570
set hot space Steve would you like to

519
00:21:58,570 --> 00:22:02,889
take this one you dropped a bomb you won

520
00:22:02,889 --> 00:22:07,419
with the static analysis thing does it

521
00:22:07,419 --> 00:22:08,500
work with

522
00:22:08,500 --> 00:22:10,960
does it work within the DevOps space

523
00:22:10,960 --> 00:22:13,539
some do and some don't some it I think

524
00:22:13,539 --> 00:22:16,659
some of the traditional let's call them

525
00:22:16,659 --> 00:22:17,980
asks I don't know

526
00:22:17,980 --> 00:22:21,039
applications assed I asked some of them

527
00:22:21,039 --> 00:22:24,220
some still work well in terms of the

528
00:22:24,220 --> 00:22:26,500
more higher velocity agile development

529
00:22:26,500 --> 00:22:29,890
space I mean come from a few other

530
00:22:29,890 --> 00:22:32,370
vendors that maybe were in this space

531
00:22:32,370 --> 00:22:35,409
and having moved into cloud native that

532
00:22:35,409 --> 00:22:37,000
was almost an intentional move to try

533
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:39,490
and keep up so there's my sort of answer

534
00:22:39,490 --> 00:22:40,630
in an answer

535
00:22:40,630 --> 00:22:43,330
I think fast is a little slow I think

536
00:22:43,330 --> 00:22:45,460
people in the space people I talk to now

537
00:22:45,460 --> 00:22:48,070
look at it as something that not only is

538
00:22:48,070 --> 00:22:51,850
it well slow but we're applying it to a

539
00:22:51,850 --> 00:22:53,080
micro service environment what we're

540
00:22:53,080 --> 00:22:54,580
looking at much smaller codebase is that

541
00:22:54,580 --> 00:22:56,289
by default seem a lot more secure and

542
00:22:56,289 --> 00:22:58,299
then the path through those interactions

543
00:22:58,299 --> 00:23:00,549
is very difficult to trace there are

544
00:23:00,549 --> 00:23:02,860
other methods that might be more

545
00:23:02,860 --> 00:23:04,960
appropriate and that's I think why you

546
00:23:04,960 --> 00:23:07,090
see when you look at security tooling as

547
00:23:07,090 --> 00:23:08,890
it's being developed by a CNC f you see

548
00:23:08,890 --> 00:23:10,690
a lot more security tooling that is now

549
00:23:10,690 --> 00:23:16,919
being tailored better to this world okay

550
00:23:16,919 --> 00:23:20,110
Wendy do you have anything else to add

551
00:23:20,110 --> 00:23:24,429
to this sure I think I think just

552
00:23:24,429 --> 00:23:27,669
through just through the the program

553
00:23:27,669 --> 00:23:30,549
that we've sort of gone through we just

554
00:23:30,549 --> 00:23:32,230
spend a lot of time talking to

555
00:23:32,230 --> 00:23:34,120
developers so I've not come from a

556
00:23:34,120 --> 00:23:35,890
developer background but I think you

557
00:23:35,890 --> 00:23:39,250
know you should use as much experience

558
00:23:39,250 --> 00:23:41,679
as you have in the company and in terms

559
00:23:41,679 --> 00:23:43,870
of you know the tool sets there's

560
00:23:43,870 --> 00:23:45,760
surprisingly there's actually a

561
00:23:45,760 --> 00:23:49,179
variation in sort of tools that which

562
00:23:49,179 --> 00:23:52,840
allows you to fit into you know which is

563
00:23:52,840 --> 00:23:55,870
app SEC you know just the scanners for

564
00:23:55,870 --> 00:23:58,539
the binaries at the end or tools that

565
00:23:58,539 --> 00:24:01,330
allow you to do scans at source code in

566
00:24:01,330 --> 00:24:03,909
the IDE you know and do incremental

567
00:24:03,909 --> 00:24:08,020
scans so that there are I think in terms

568
00:24:08,020 --> 00:24:11,500
of when you're looking at your usually

569
00:24:11,500 --> 00:24:13,659
based on requirements but when you look

570
00:24:13,659 --> 00:24:15,490
for tools I think you need to look at

571
00:24:15,490 --> 00:24:17,140
what your what issues that you're trying

572
00:24:17,140 --> 00:24:21,210
to address which tools will fit into

573
00:24:21,210 --> 00:24:23,100
that will fit better in your environment

574
00:24:23,100 --> 00:24:28,049
and for your developers I think yeah I

575
00:24:28,049 --> 00:24:29,970
mean developer feedback in terms of you

576
00:24:29,970 --> 00:24:31,590
know allow them to to play around with

577
00:24:31,590 --> 00:24:33,630
it a bit I think you know not

578
00:24:33,630 --> 00:24:36,299
necessarily how to do the RP before the

579
00:24:36,299 --> 00:24:38,820
POC but you know get feedback from them

580
00:24:38,820 --> 00:24:42,720
and sort of to say you know how how

581
00:24:42,720 --> 00:24:44,370
effective they think different tools are

582
00:24:44,370 --> 00:24:46,740
we I was actually quite surprised on

583
00:24:46,740 --> 00:24:48,600
speaking to the team of this sort of

584
00:24:48,600 --> 00:24:50,970
variation sort of tool kind of usability

585
00:24:50,970 --> 00:24:53,370
as it were from the developer point of

586
00:24:53,370 --> 00:24:57,210
view okay all right so let's focus a bit

587
00:24:57,210 --> 00:25:02,039
on purely application code so your

588
00:25:02,039 --> 00:25:04,679
business application let's kind of

589
00:25:04,679 --> 00:25:07,320
parkus IB the infrastructure side of

590
00:25:07,320 --> 00:25:09,750
things so so typically within the app

591
00:25:09,750 --> 00:25:13,200
set world when you talk about securing

592
00:25:13,200 --> 00:25:16,440
secure code in etc you do do some risk

593
00:25:16,440 --> 00:25:19,230
assessment fret modelling you you may

594
00:25:19,230 --> 00:25:21,419
throw in some static code analysis which

595
00:25:21,419 --> 00:25:24,000
could be expensive in terms of build

596
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:29,039
times etc dynamic analysis interactive

597
00:25:29,039 --> 00:25:31,470
analysis checking your open source flow

598
00:25:31,470 --> 00:25:34,020
party components and the good old pen

599
00:25:34,020 --> 00:25:36,090
testing so we've got a range of

600
00:25:36,090 --> 00:25:39,840
different testing which can fit in at

601
00:25:39,840 --> 00:25:42,059
different points within the delivery

602
00:25:42,059 --> 00:25:45,360
lifecycle but if an organization was

603
00:25:45,360 --> 00:25:48,299
trying to break into this and let it be

604
00:25:48,299 --> 00:25:50,850
a small organization a start-up or a

605
00:25:50,850 --> 00:25:55,500
large enterprise do we have a preference

606
00:25:55,500 --> 00:25:59,190
in terms of what to tackle first or all

607
00:25:59,190 --> 00:26:02,130
choose first grunt would you like to

608
00:26:02,130 --> 00:26:06,360
answer this one sure yeah there's a lot

609
00:26:06,360 --> 00:26:08,190
in there so I'll kind of break it down

610
00:26:08,190 --> 00:26:11,429
into little chunks but yeah I think the

611
00:26:11,429 --> 00:26:12,510
first thing is like a lot of those

612
00:26:12,510 --> 00:26:14,880
activities you know fit really well into

613
00:26:14,880 --> 00:26:17,220
dev sec ops and some of them you know

614
00:26:17,220 --> 00:26:18,929
they do work but they need to they need

615
00:26:18,929 --> 00:26:20,220
a lot of hand-holding you know threat

616
00:26:20,220 --> 00:26:22,799
modeling doesn't really fit into an

617
00:26:22,799 --> 00:26:24,390
automated world that well I mean there's

618
00:26:24,390 --> 00:26:25,980
lots of efforts now to do threat

619
00:26:25,980 --> 00:26:27,809
modeling at scale and stuff like that

620
00:26:27,809 --> 00:26:29,820
but I'm certainly like SAST and DAST

621
00:26:29,820 --> 00:26:32,100
those things are sort of tried and

622
00:26:32,100 --> 00:26:33,720
tested and we're getting much better at

623
00:26:33,720 --> 00:26:34,870
those things

624
00:26:34,870 --> 00:26:36,850
you know I think it's a combination of

625
00:26:36,850 --> 00:26:41,170
those sort of asks that you need right

626
00:26:41,170 --> 00:26:43,930
you know if you think of traditional you

627
00:26:43,930 --> 00:26:45,309
know verification right not just

628
00:26:45,309 --> 00:26:46,720
security but like product verification

629
00:26:46,720 --> 00:26:48,610
right if you if you want to check that

630
00:26:48,610 --> 00:26:50,530
there's nothing wrong with the car then

631
00:26:50,530 --> 00:26:52,090
you're gonna have to you know walk

632
00:26:52,090 --> 00:26:54,130
around the car take a look at it you

633
00:26:54,130 --> 00:26:55,300
know does everything look okay maybe

634
00:26:55,300 --> 00:26:56,260
lift up the bonnet

635
00:26:56,260 --> 00:26:58,270
you know this there's everything look

636
00:26:58,270 --> 00:27:00,309
okay under the hood the cables connected

637
00:27:00,309 --> 00:27:02,980
you know nothing's loose and that's kind

638
00:27:02,980 --> 00:27:04,660
of like sassed right you're scanning

639
00:27:04,660 --> 00:27:06,160
things offline you don't really see the

640
00:27:06,160 --> 00:27:08,140
data flows you know as was alluded to

641
00:27:08,140 --> 00:27:10,690
earlier you know with micro-services you

642
00:27:10,690 --> 00:27:12,520
get like a snapshot perspective but you

643
00:27:12,520 --> 00:27:14,350
don't really see necessarily how

644
00:27:14,350 --> 00:27:16,750
everything sort of connects which is

645
00:27:16,750 --> 00:27:18,490
where des comes in right and you start

646
00:27:18,490 --> 00:27:20,410
to do you know you take the car for a

647
00:27:20,410 --> 00:27:22,150
drive front the neighborhood's you know

648
00:27:22,150 --> 00:27:23,890
do the brakes feel okay is the steering

649
00:27:23,890 --> 00:27:26,770
off you know you can verify it like that

650
00:27:26,770 --> 00:27:29,559
and then I asked kind of like if you

651
00:27:29,559 --> 00:27:31,990
could drive it around and observe

652
00:27:31,990 --> 00:27:33,520
everything that's happening but you

653
00:27:33,520 --> 00:27:35,080
could also see the sensors right what

654
00:27:35,080 --> 00:27:37,840
was the the fuel injection ratio is that

655
00:27:37,840 --> 00:27:39,910
is the temperature of the engine okay

656
00:27:39,910 --> 00:27:41,350
what are the oil levels so you're

657
00:27:41,350 --> 00:27:42,490
getting all of these kind of metrics

658
00:27:42,490 --> 00:27:44,140
from the inner workings of the systems

659
00:27:44,140 --> 00:27:46,510
and it's more interactive than you see

660
00:27:46,510 --> 00:27:48,250
things these are all things that fit

661
00:27:48,250 --> 00:27:50,020
really well in dev sai cops in my

662
00:27:50,020 --> 00:27:53,080
opinion things like SCA I think they're

663
00:27:53,080 --> 00:27:55,480
also super important to I think

664
00:27:55,480 --> 00:27:58,390
especially if if you have like large

665
00:27:58,390 --> 00:28:00,700
portfolios and you're not doing SCA then

666
00:28:00,700 --> 00:28:03,130
I think it's a really important activity

667
00:28:03,130 --> 00:28:04,450
just to see what the lay of the land

668
00:28:04,450 --> 00:28:06,400
looks like you know like how much

669
00:28:06,400 --> 00:28:07,720
open-source are you using

670
00:28:07,720 --> 00:28:11,050
how well updated is that stuff how

671
00:28:11,050 --> 00:28:13,780
vulnerable is that stuff so I think SCA

672
00:28:13,780 --> 00:28:15,600
also has a really important place

673
00:28:15,600 --> 00:28:19,000
pentesting is you know is one of those

674
00:28:19,000 --> 00:28:21,010
activities that struggles a bit here you

675
00:28:21,010 --> 00:28:22,300
know like the traditional approach of

676
00:28:22,300 --> 00:28:23,650
working with development teams and

677
00:28:23,650 --> 00:28:27,690
giving them a PDF you know 15 days later

678
00:28:27,690 --> 00:28:30,990
yeah I don't like to be that guy but

679
00:28:30,990 --> 00:28:34,059
yeah it's it's not great right you know

680
00:28:34,059 --> 00:28:36,760
people want things in real time you know

681
00:28:36,760 --> 00:28:38,950
they want integrations with JIRA and you

682
00:28:38,950 --> 00:28:40,660
know get lab and github and stuff like

683
00:28:40,660 --> 00:28:42,550
that and where they can start working on

684
00:28:42,550 --> 00:28:44,260
the issues and get actioning them that

685
00:28:44,260 --> 00:28:46,300
you know they're and then not two weeks

686
00:28:46,300 --> 00:28:48,020
three weeks four weeks out

687
00:28:48,020 --> 00:28:50,240
so I think some of these things you know

688
00:28:50,240 --> 00:28:52,400
do make a lot of sense and like you said

689
00:28:52,400 --> 00:28:53,420
maybe if you're a smaller organization

690
00:28:53,420 --> 00:28:55,820
or a larger organization that that does

691
00:28:55,820 --> 00:28:59,600
change a bit but I think that the the

692
00:28:59,600 --> 00:29:00,800
important point is that all of these

693
00:29:00,800 --> 00:29:03,680
things you know are key security

694
00:29:03,680 --> 00:29:05,240
activities that you're gonna have in

695
00:29:05,240 --> 00:29:08,810
your SCLC what you can put into you know

696
00:29:08,810 --> 00:29:11,060
pipelines and automate to get really

697
00:29:11,060 --> 00:29:13,790
good coverage yeah that's that's a bit

698
00:29:13,790 --> 00:29:17,230
trickier so for a small organization

699
00:29:17,230 --> 00:29:22,370
would you dare to answer or pick one of

700
00:29:22,370 --> 00:29:26,210
the testing approaches yeah I think if

701
00:29:26,210 --> 00:29:30,190
if you're relatively small I would say

702
00:29:30,640 --> 00:29:32,480
you're probably gonna get some quick

703
00:29:32,480 --> 00:29:36,830
wins from sassed it's it can be you know

704
00:29:36,830 --> 00:29:39,080
I said it can be slow and it's not going

705
00:29:39,080 --> 00:29:41,450
to give you great coverage fast on top

706
00:29:41,450 --> 00:29:43,910
of that is is going to be you know even

707
00:29:43,910 --> 00:29:45,560
better and so if you can have something

708
00:29:45,560 --> 00:29:47,660
that does both SAST and DAST then I

709
00:29:47,660 --> 00:29:50,620
think you're off to a really good start

710
00:29:50,620 --> 00:29:52,670
yeah exactly

711
00:29:52,670 --> 00:29:54,260
but you're never really gonna replace

712
00:29:54,260 --> 00:29:57,260
you know the requirement to you know

713
00:29:57,260 --> 00:29:59,150
look at threats and risk assess your

714
00:29:59,150 --> 00:30:00,770
systems through threat modeling if

715
00:30:00,770 --> 00:30:01,820
you've got critical apps you're gonna

716
00:30:01,820 --> 00:30:04,190
need to do that so I'm hesitant to say

717
00:30:04,190 --> 00:30:06,560
yeah just use a sass or you know you are

718
00:30:06,560 --> 00:30:09,200
going to need those other activities but

719
00:30:09,200 --> 00:30:10,850
yeah I think you know you're certainly

720
00:30:10,850 --> 00:30:12,440
going to get some some good coverage and

721
00:30:12,440 --> 00:30:14,110
through a combination of SAST and DAST

722
00:30:14,110 --> 00:30:19,040
okay static and dynamic Oh mmm not my

723
00:30:19,040 --> 00:30:19,580
choices

724
00:30:19,580 --> 00:30:22,670
let's but before I share my opinion when

725
00:30:22,670 --> 00:30:29,030
Wendy so this is which one would I

726
00:30:29,030 --> 00:30:37,250
select okay so I mean I mean does is

727
00:30:37,250 --> 00:30:40,160
essentially automated pen test right so

728
00:30:40,160 --> 00:30:42,380
I think in terms of you know if you want

729
00:30:42,380 --> 00:30:45,290
to kind of effectively say time and

730
00:30:45,290 --> 00:30:47,390
you're you know you're basically doing

731
00:30:47,390 --> 00:30:51,340
you're you're you want to review your

732
00:30:51,340 --> 00:30:55,010
test test in your application in kind of

733
00:30:55,010 --> 00:30:58,700
real-time you know as it were

734
00:30:58,700 --> 00:31:01,940
that is a good option I'm just looking

735
00:31:01,940 --> 00:31:03,590
at just thinking about I mean I think

736
00:31:03,590 --> 00:31:05,600
this is probably different for every

737
00:31:05,600 --> 00:31:08,779
organization but a lot of organization

738
00:31:08,779 --> 00:31:10,369
and if you look at lots of you know the

739
00:31:10,369 --> 00:31:14,269
code in terms of makeup I think open

740
00:31:14,269 --> 00:31:18,700
source is probably one of the the key

741
00:31:18,700 --> 00:31:22,549
test tools that organization because if

742
00:31:22,549 --> 00:31:24,559
you look at most organizations and it's

743
00:31:24,559 --> 00:31:28,928
not not just experienced I just sort of

744
00:31:29,559 --> 00:31:32,629
my majority of the code are from

745
00:31:32,629 --> 00:31:34,340
libraries open source libraries right

746
00:31:34,340 --> 00:31:37,600
there's only relatively limited kind of

747
00:31:37,600 --> 00:31:42,289
bespoke code which your static analysis

748
00:31:42,289 --> 00:31:44,539
engine will pick up so I think I'll

749
00:31:44,539 --> 00:31:47,690
definitely include the esier the open

750
00:31:47,690 --> 00:31:50,450
source elements in there um it's it's

751
00:31:50,450 --> 00:31:52,190
kind of it's quite difficult to select

752
00:31:52,190 --> 00:31:54,679
because ideally I like to have it across

753
00:31:54,679 --> 00:31:56,989
the board right I like to have you know

754
00:31:56,989 --> 00:31:59,960
it's I want this Oh on the static I want

755
00:31:59,960 --> 00:32:02,570
the open source so that you know and you

756
00:32:02,570 --> 00:32:04,940
know I ask this sort of flight is

757
00:32:04,940 --> 00:32:07,009
basically it's sort of dynamic but you

758
00:32:07,009 --> 00:32:09,109
kind of know where it is you know so you

759
00:32:09,109 --> 00:32:11,720
can go in and find vulnerabilities but I

760
00:32:11,720 --> 00:32:14,059
think as a baseline possibly as a

761
00:32:14,059 --> 00:32:19,609
baseline I think I would go for if it's

762
00:32:19,609 --> 00:32:21,919
security testing tools with pen test I

763
00:32:21,919 --> 00:32:24,230
think I would go for static and open

764
00:32:24,230 --> 00:32:27,679
source I think there's there's another

765
00:32:27,679 --> 00:32:29,210
small consideration there that I would

766
00:32:29,210 --> 00:32:33,080
just quickly before we move on and a key

767
00:32:33,080 --> 00:32:34,429
thing right is gonna be in an

768
00:32:34,429 --> 00:32:37,220
organization size its cost right doing

769
00:32:37,220 --> 00:32:38,570
pen testing and threat modeling is

770
00:32:38,570 --> 00:32:41,539
extremely expensive you know where's are

771
00:32:41,539 --> 00:32:42,980
you gonna do a pen tests on every build

772
00:32:42,980 --> 00:32:45,080
that you turn out to three times a day

773
00:32:45,080 --> 00:32:47,239
no like it's gonna cost you a fortune if

774
00:32:47,239 --> 00:32:49,100
you if you try and do that right even if

775
00:32:49,100 --> 00:32:50,480
you're doing a pen test a week or a

776
00:32:50,480 --> 00:32:52,879
pentose a month internal or external

777
00:32:52,879 --> 00:32:55,039
these things you know really rack up and

778
00:32:55,039 --> 00:32:58,460
cost so again depending on your size

779
00:32:58,460 --> 00:33:00,470
maybe from a cost perspective you know

780
00:33:00,470 --> 00:33:02,090
some of the other activities make a lot

781
00:33:02,090 --> 00:33:03,889
more sense than some of the traditional

782
00:33:03,889 --> 00:33:05,840
ones not to bash on them except as

783
00:33:05,840 --> 00:33:08,509
acknowledged they are important know but

784
00:33:08,509 --> 00:33:10,960
cost is extremely important I think

785
00:33:10,960 --> 00:33:13,210
just from my perspective here guys I

786
00:33:13,210 --> 00:33:17,260
think you got to be realistic as to with

787
00:33:17,260 --> 00:33:19,090
your own abilities the organization's

788
00:33:19,090 --> 00:33:21,250
abilities of the security team's

789
00:33:21,250 --> 00:33:23,919
abilities from a which because we went

790
00:33:23,919 --> 00:33:25,840
from being you know tech savvy to

791
00:33:25,840 --> 00:33:27,909
security savvy back to being deviseth

792
00:33:27,909 --> 00:33:30,220
tech savvy secure savvy dev savvy

793
00:33:30,220 --> 00:33:31,419
security savviness we're bouncing around

794
00:33:31,419 --> 00:33:33,490
with those kind of I'm gonna be more of

795
00:33:33,490 --> 00:33:35,649
a developer security guy or more of a

796
00:33:35,649 --> 00:33:37,960
security pentest guy all of those things

797
00:33:37,960 --> 00:33:38,980
are actually really important these days

798
00:33:38,980 --> 00:33:41,200
so do you have the guys are actually

799
00:33:41,200 --> 00:33:42,429
going to be able do you have an

800
00:33:42,429 --> 00:33:44,830
application security team you know will

801
00:33:44,830 --> 00:33:45,940
they be able to interpret the results

802
00:33:45,940 --> 00:33:47,470
will they'll be able to assist the

803
00:33:47,470 --> 00:33:49,480
developers do the developers understand

804
00:33:49,480 --> 00:33:51,909
the results right so that's that's the

805
00:33:51,909 --> 00:33:53,710
kind of limit what you're gonna choose

806
00:33:53,710 --> 00:33:55,539
maybe I just want to go back to Grant's

807
00:33:55,539 --> 00:33:56,799
point about the desk I had a good

808
00:33:56,799 --> 00:33:58,570
analogy there cuz I thought it's it's

809
00:33:58,570 --> 00:34:00,220
not it's not like you're driving the car

810
00:34:00,220 --> 00:34:01,600
around the block is actually your

811
00:34:01,600 --> 00:34:03,220
security team driving the car on the

812
00:34:03,220 --> 00:34:05,409
block at full throttle and then taking

813
00:34:05,409 --> 00:34:07,210
it around to the racetrack and give me a

814
00:34:07,210 --> 00:34:09,070
good bashing and see how it survives and

815
00:34:09,070 --> 00:34:10,629
then going back to the development team

816
00:34:10,629 --> 00:34:14,230
and Sony you couldn't hold you couldn't

817
00:34:14,230 --> 00:34:16,359
we expect we injected it would like a

818
00:34:16,359 --> 00:34:18,489
million requests per second and we found

819
00:34:18,489 --> 00:34:21,070
all this stuff rubbish you know so it's

820
00:34:21,070 --> 00:34:25,989
a bit unfair so I think its source also

821
00:34:25,989 --> 00:34:27,668
if you have a single language and you

822
00:34:27,668 --> 00:34:30,190
use a single framework then its life is

823
00:34:30,190 --> 00:34:31,570
gonna be very easy for you whatever you

824
00:34:31,570 --> 00:34:33,879
choose even you choose to pentester you

825
00:34:33,879 --> 00:34:35,889
choose to do - SAS even if you want to

826
00:34:35,889 --> 00:34:38,440
do rasp it be very everything's ubi but

827
00:34:38,440 --> 00:34:40,960
the reality is so many things out there

828
00:34:40,960 --> 00:34:42,730
people using so many languages so many

829
00:34:42,730 --> 00:34:44,859
frameworks we're struggling with

830
00:34:44,859 --> 00:34:46,629
security staff that you know have the

831
00:34:46,629 --> 00:34:48,040
development background that understand

832
00:34:48,040 --> 00:34:51,280
this stuff and so therefore you've got

833
00:34:51,280 --> 00:34:52,570
to be realistic so what are you trying

834
00:34:52,570 --> 00:34:54,399
to defend against like do you want to

835
00:34:54,399 --> 00:34:55,418
build a fort knox when you're just

836
00:34:55,418 --> 00:35:00,430
selling I don't know plastic toys but

837
00:35:00,430 --> 00:35:02,080
you sell a million plastic toy I don't

838
00:35:02,080 --> 00:35:03,310
what do you what are you trying I mean

839
00:35:03,310 --> 00:35:05,410
are you trying to get the highly secure

840
00:35:05,410 --> 00:35:08,470
environment but are you really pushing

841
00:35:08,470 --> 00:35:10,000
your development team in your business

842
00:35:10,000 --> 00:35:12,520
and your product managers to to put so

843
00:35:12,520 --> 00:35:14,830
much security that is really unrealistic

844
00:35:14,830 --> 00:35:17,830
so I think that you need to understand

845
00:35:17,830 --> 00:35:20,230
what enough security means the

846
00:35:20,230 --> 00:35:22,869
organisation and understand the time

847
00:35:22,869 --> 00:35:24,090
that you have to spend

848
00:35:24,090 --> 00:35:25,770
on integration and the resources you

849
00:35:25,770 --> 00:35:28,290
have and also the skillset both from a

850
00:35:28,290 --> 00:35:30,450
development perspective and from your

851
00:35:30,450 --> 00:35:32,130
developers side and also from your

852
00:35:32,130 --> 00:35:34,080
InfoSec security side so I think that's

853
00:35:34,080 --> 00:35:37,110
also really important that's that's a

854
00:35:37,110 --> 00:35:38,970
really great point context is very

855
00:35:38,970 --> 00:35:44,640
important is great okay so most of the

856
00:35:44,640 --> 00:35:46,890
testing approaches I'm we mentioned

857
00:35:46,890 --> 00:35:49,290
earlier are very traditional as well as

858
00:35:49,290 --> 00:35:52,260
we stated but obviously in our current

859
00:35:52,260 --> 00:35:54,840
lives everybody has at least one mobile

860
00:35:54,840 --> 00:35:58,200
device right so if we can access it from

861
00:35:58,200 --> 00:36:00,480
our desktops through our laptops then we

862
00:36:00,480 --> 00:36:03,540
it should be available through on your

863
00:36:03,540 --> 00:36:06,780
mobile now that's a completely different

864
00:36:06,780 --> 00:36:10,140
landscape so the the testings that we

865
00:36:10,140 --> 00:36:12,870
mentioned earlier do they actually fit

866
00:36:12,870 --> 00:36:17,940
in for for a mobile application gran do

867
00:36:17,940 --> 00:36:23,730
you want to take this one sure yeah I

868
00:36:23,730 --> 00:36:28,710
think yeah I think they do and I think

869
00:36:28,710 --> 00:36:31,860
like many things this is like a

870
00:36:31,860 --> 00:36:34,440
progressional thing right we've been

871
00:36:34,440 --> 00:36:37,620
looking at traditional like applications

872
00:36:37,620 --> 00:36:40,940
here in web security you know for

873
00:36:40,940 --> 00:36:44,220
decades you know literally decades right

874
00:36:44,220 --> 00:36:47,010
and we still have sequel injection

875
00:36:47,010 --> 00:36:49,170
I think rest you know these tools have

876
00:36:49,170 --> 00:36:51,600
been built over time admittedly not

877
00:36:51,600 --> 00:36:54,180
everything fit into you know the ways

878
00:36:54,180 --> 00:36:56,610
that we work in function as seams now

879
00:36:56,610 --> 00:36:58,710
and but many of even the traditional

880
00:36:58,710 --> 00:37:02,660
tools do fit into that that way of life

881
00:37:02,660 --> 00:37:06,150
the mobile testing approach and the

882
00:37:06,150 --> 00:37:09,510
tools around that are certainly there if

883
00:37:09,510 --> 00:37:11,090
you go out you can find them you know

884
00:37:11,090 --> 00:37:13,650
working with one vendor on that on that

885
00:37:13,650 --> 00:37:14,820
just now

886
00:37:14,820 --> 00:37:18,000
but they are you know we do as a market

887
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:21,480
have you know have put less time into

888
00:37:21,480 --> 00:37:23,730
these tools then you know the previous

889
00:37:23,730 --> 00:37:25,290
decades we spent on other tools right so

890
00:37:25,290 --> 00:37:27,870
if you're looking at you know testing a

891
00:37:27,870 --> 00:37:30,390
mobile app you can't just go and use you

892
00:37:30,390 --> 00:37:31,560
know the same old tools that you've been

893
00:37:31,560 --> 00:37:33,180
using for the last 15 years right you

894
00:37:33,180 --> 00:37:34,350
have to go and find something that's

895
00:37:34,350 --> 00:37:34,779
four

896
00:37:34,779 --> 00:37:38,469
purpose you know and again it's like you

897
00:37:38,469 --> 00:37:41,499
said some organizations you know may not

898
00:37:41,499 --> 00:37:42,880
have a mobile app but I would dare to

899
00:37:42,880 --> 00:37:45,130
think that most organizations now have a

900
00:37:45,130 --> 00:37:47,919
mobile app and if not just having a

901
00:37:47,919 --> 00:37:48,880
mobile app they're probably writing

902
00:37:48,880 --> 00:37:50,319
their their mobile apps before they

903
00:37:50,319 --> 00:37:52,140
write anything else right mobile first

904
00:37:52,140 --> 00:37:55,269
and in which case right if mostly your

905
00:37:55,269 --> 00:37:57,069
business and mostly your food traffic's

906
00:37:57,069 --> 00:37:58,689
coming through mobile then it's it's

907
00:37:58,689 --> 00:38:00,939
gonna be equally important to look at

908
00:38:00,939 --> 00:38:04,059
that and I think if you know if you are

909
00:38:04,059 --> 00:38:06,339
working in that space then there's a

910
00:38:06,339 --> 00:38:08,739
very high chance that you're working you

911
00:38:08,739 --> 00:38:10,749
know in an agile fashion and you know

912
00:38:10,749 --> 00:38:11,439
you live and breathe

913
00:38:11,439 --> 00:38:14,140
they have soy cups and I think again

914
00:38:14,140 --> 00:38:15,699
going back to the previous points about

915
00:38:15,699 --> 00:38:18,699
your integrations with bug trackers and

916
00:38:18,699 --> 00:38:20,469
getting findings in real time and

917
00:38:20,469 --> 00:38:21,729
scanning if we build I think they're

918
00:38:21,729 --> 00:38:24,519
certainly evermore common I've

919
00:38:24,519 --> 00:38:26,559
specialized in mobile for for many years

920
00:38:26,559 --> 00:38:28,949
and from every customer I've worked with

921
00:38:28,949 --> 00:38:31,839
you know they do things like pen testing

922
00:38:31,839 --> 00:38:34,029
but all of the solutions now where you

923
00:38:34,029 --> 00:38:37,150
can get continues scanning and you know

924
00:38:37,150 --> 00:38:39,640
test every build that would SAS and I

925
00:38:39,640 --> 00:38:41,619
asked these are the things that people

926
00:38:41,619 --> 00:38:43,509
are really enjoying to use from a

927
00:38:43,509 --> 00:38:46,150
development site you know and from a

928
00:38:46,150 --> 00:38:48,130
security perspective you know if we can

929
00:38:48,130 --> 00:38:51,640
get coverage as as left as possible you

930
00:38:51,640 --> 00:38:53,799
know and find things earlier then in the

931
00:38:53,799 --> 00:38:54,999
long run again that's gonna save us

932
00:38:54,999 --> 00:38:59,759
money so cool

933
00:38:59,759 --> 00:39:02,769
anything to add anybody on that mobile

934
00:39:02,769 --> 00:39:06,868
application testing it's quite niche

935
00:39:07,079 --> 00:39:13,299
just make sure you do something used of

936
00:39:13,299 --> 00:39:15,159
choose because just just do pick admit

937
00:39:15,159 --> 00:39:16,869
whatever it is just pull out the back

938
00:39:16,869 --> 00:39:18,969
and do something gillies can't go wrong

939
00:39:18,969 --> 00:39:22,150
if you're doing something that's right

940
00:39:22,150 --> 00:39:25,689
okay right so we've talked a bit about

941
00:39:25,689 --> 00:39:28,839
tech at the beginning KT kind of kicked

942
00:39:28,839 --> 00:39:31,679
off to talk about how we could measure

943
00:39:31,679 --> 00:39:35,019
the the progress of factoring def sec

944
00:39:35,019 --> 00:39:37,659
hops into your pipeline but from a

945
00:39:37,659 --> 00:39:39,400
cultural point of view and we've kind of

946
00:39:39,400 --> 00:39:40,719
touched on this throughout the

947
00:39:40,719 --> 00:39:44,619
discussion and there must be war stories

948
00:39:44,619 --> 00:39:47,700
that you guys can share so you know

949
00:39:47,700 --> 00:39:49,710
a typical comment that I've heard a few

950
00:39:49,710 --> 00:39:52,380
times in different organization is well

951
00:39:52,380 --> 00:39:54,150
if it's going to take more than three

952
00:39:54,150 --> 00:39:56,309
seconds to do that security testing in

953
00:39:56,309 --> 00:39:59,000
my pipeline we're not going to use it so

954
00:39:59,000 --> 00:40:02,430
these are I mean that that's quite

955
00:40:02,430 --> 00:40:04,859
extreme but these are some of the

956
00:40:04,859 --> 00:40:07,589
cultural organizational challenges that

957
00:40:07,589 --> 00:40:11,640
I face and I'm sure some you guys have

958
00:40:11,640 --> 00:40:13,799
faced as well and so Wendy would you

959
00:40:13,799 --> 00:40:16,400
like to share some of your war stories

960
00:40:16,400 --> 00:40:20,220
sure I mean I think you know in a way

961
00:40:20,220 --> 00:40:21,839
from from the sort of conversation I

962
00:40:21,839 --> 00:40:23,280
think because security is such an

963
00:40:23,280 --> 00:40:25,440
important you know it's it's got board

964
00:40:25,440 --> 00:40:28,260
level visibility you know given the

965
00:40:28,260 --> 00:40:30,780
number of attacks that we experienced

966
00:40:30,780 --> 00:40:37,380
number of breaches I think there is you

967
00:40:37,380 --> 00:40:39,299
know there is an understanding even for

968
00:40:39,299 --> 00:40:41,400
developers that security is important I

969
00:40:41,400 --> 00:40:45,240
think form from kind of from the

970
00:40:45,240 --> 00:40:46,980
developments point of view and you know

971
00:40:46,980 --> 00:40:48,150
I would

972
00:40:48,150 --> 00:40:50,940
I completely understand this they would

973
00:40:50,940 --> 00:40:53,309
like to do it's not that they're kind of

974
00:40:53,309 --> 00:40:55,049
going we're just not doing security you

975
00:40:55,049 --> 00:40:56,700
know we're not we're not doing scans and

976
00:40:56,700 --> 00:40:58,440
we don't we don't want to remediate our

977
00:40:58,440 --> 00:41:00,480
you know vulnerabilities right I think

978
00:41:00,480 --> 00:41:03,059
what they are coming to us to say is

979
00:41:03,059 --> 00:41:05,880
look you know we we want to do the right

980
00:41:05,880 --> 00:41:09,690
thing and they you know people people do

981
00:41:09,690 --> 00:41:12,690
do want to do the right thing can you

982
00:41:12,690 --> 00:41:15,359
please give us a tool that allows us to

983
00:41:15,359 --> 00:41:18,359
sort of integrate security and do our

984
00:41:18,359 --> 00:41:20,520
testing you know whether it's sort of

985
00:41:20,520 --> 00:41:22,530
like doing incremental tests so you know

986
00:41:22,530 --> 00:41:25,470
whether once I have you know written

987
00:41:25,470 --> 00:41:28,619
amount of code or it's if it's doing ID

988
00:41:28,619 --> 00:41:31,349
level you know just doing a quick scam I

989
00:41:31,349 --> 00:41:36,089
saw as a developer's code can give us a

990
00:41:36,089 --> 00:41:37,890
tool that allow us to do it as

991
00:41:37,890 --> 00:41:40,920
painlessly as possible and what you know

992
00:41:40,920 --> 00:41:44,670
so when you know once you find the

993
00:41:44,670 --> 00:41:46,260
vulnerabilities where they are located

994
00:41:46,260 --> 00:41:51,690
how to remediate it and you know the

995
00:41:51,690 --> 00:41:53,400
thing Katie mentioned about false

996
00:41:53,400 --> 00:41:55,680
positive you know how do we tune this

997
00:41:55,680 --> 00:41:58,440
scan engine so that we have we minimize

998
00:41:58,440 --> 00:42:00,720
the number to false positives going

999
00:42:00,720 --> 00:42:01,710
forward and we come

1000
00:42:01,710 --> 00:42:03,630
marked them and we can exclude them from

1001
00:42:03,630 --> 00:42:06,930
subsequent scans I think it date that

1002
00:42:06,930 --> 00:42:08,580
they're kind of more coming to us on

1003
00:42:08,580 --> 00:42:10,650
that Robin sort of we don't want to do

1004
00:42:10,650 --> 00:42:12,450
security because I think this there's an

1005
00:42:12,450 --> 00:42:15,119
understanding that is important is part

1006
00:42:15,119 --> 00:42:16,500
of their it should be part of the

1007
00:42:16,500 --> 00:42:18,119
backlog it should be part of you know

1008
00:42:18,119 --> 00:42:20,040
the sort of application development

1009
00:42:20,040 --> 00:42:24,359
process that's great Steve you've got a

1010
00:42:24,359 --> 00:42:26,369
strong consultancy background you've

1011
00:42:26,369 --> 00:42:27,630
you've worked we have a number of

1012
00:42:27,630 --> 00:42:31,050
different organizations is there

1013
00:42:31,050 --> 00:42:32,880
anything you you can share from your

1014
00:42:32,880 --> 00:42:38,790
perspective as a supplier I have

1015
00:42:38,790 --> 00:42:41,369
potentially too many horror stories as a

1016
00:42:41,369 --> 00:42:44,910
supplier it's it's very humbling well it

1017
00:42:44,910 --> 00:42:47,940
really is it's very humbling if an

1018
00:42:47,940 --> 00:42:49,560
organization buys a security tool it's

1019
00:42:49,560 --> 00:42:51,480
part of my organization and then I am

1020
00:42:51,480 --> 00:42:53,520
brought in to talk about the successful

1021
00:42:53,520 --> 00:42:55,440
deployment of that and then I see how

1022
00:42:55,440 --> 00:42:56,730
difficult is going to be and that

1023
00:42:56,730 --> 00:42:58,950
perhaps we introduced more operational

1024
00:42:58,950 --> 00:43:00,930
overhead and more friction and therefore

1025
00:43:00,930 --> 00:43:02,880
more problems than we actually solved

1026
00:43:02,880 --> 00:43:04,260
which kind of goes back to your how do

1027
00:43:04,260 --> 00:43:06,000
you choose tools that achieve a

1028
00:43:06,000 --> 00:43:08,790
low-friction interface to the developers

1029
00:43:08,790 --> 00:43:10,650
who ultimately kind of decide whether

1030
00:43:10,650 --> 00:43:13,400
it's going to be successful or not so

1031
00:43:13,400 --> 00:43:15,690
understanding and respecting the current

1032
00:43:15,690 --> 00:43:17,280
culture that you have in our

1033
00:43:17,280 --> 00:43:19,500
organization and that the change that

1034
00:43:19,500 --> 00:43:23,130
culture isn't going to be as fast as as

1035
00:43:23,130 --> 00:43:24,660
your software development it's going to

1036
00:43:24,660 --> 00:43:25,680
be something that you're going to have

1037
00:43:25,680 --> 00:43:28,560
to drip-feed in and and I guess and want

1038
00:43:28,560 --> 00:43:31,050
to say account for when you're using

1039
00:43:31,050 --> 00:43:32,970
your security tooling is I think there's

1040
00:43:32,970 --> 00:43:35,460
several of us have said low friction is

1041
00:43:35,460 --> 00:43:38,910
good and I I think that's that that's

1042
00:43:38,910 --> 00:43:40,859
really critical until we have developers

1043
00:43:40,859 --> 00:43:43,130
through a larger ecosystem for education

1044
00:43:43,130 --> 00:43:45,359
coming up through understanding that

1045
00:43:45,359 --> 00:43:47,160
this is more default behavior and as you

1046
00:43:47,160 --> 00:43:49,530
said when Dino developers don't want to

1047
00:43:49,530 --> 00:43:51,030
do the wrong thing they just want to do

1048
00:43:51,030 --> 00:43:53,430
the fast thing and the thing that they

1049
00:43:53,430 --> 00:43:55,650
can even all pull for themselves which

1050
00:43:55,650 --> 00:43:56,970
is why open-source communities and open

1051
00:43:56,970 --> 00:43:58,290
source tools are an awesome way in

1052
00:43:58,290 --> 00:43:59,670
because they may have already be using

1053
00:43:59,670 --> 00:44:02,369
them before you start even talking to

1054
00:44:02,369 --> 00:44:09,540
people like me that's great okay um so

1055
00:44:09,540 --> 00:44:14,190
some specific points I like to flag and

1056
00:44:14,190 --> 00:44:15,820
for us to actually discuss

1057
00:44:15,820 --> 00:44:21,940
so we always use the term CI CV and

1058
00:44:21,940 --> 00:44:24,160
obviously as part of that we're talking

1059
00:44:24,160 --> 00:44:27,760
about developing Co testing Co promoting

1060
00:44:27,760 --> 00:44:31,920
the code into production etc so this

1061
00:44:31,920 --> 00:44:37,660
delivery environment there's there's a

1062
00:44:37,660 --> 00:44:39,160
there's a difference between a

1063
00:44:39,160 --> 00:44:40,960
development system and a production

1064
00:44:40,960 --> 00:44:41,560
system

1065
00:44:41,560 --> 00:44:45,400
so is there different should the CI

1066
00:44:45,400 --> 00:44:48,600
strokes EB environments be a capped by

1067
00:44:48,600 --> 00:44:52,030
two different systems or is it just one

1068
00:44:52,030 --> 00:44:55,450
ecosystem and that you have the right

1069
00:44:55,450 --> 00:44:59,140
security controls to test the artifacts

1070
00:44:59,140 --> 00:45:01,180
that you're pushing through as well as a

1071
00:45:01,180 --> 00:45:05,530
the right security control to secure

1072
00:45:05,530 --> 00:45:10,180
that CI CB infrastructure ashraf would

1073
00:45:10,180 --> 00:45:14,290
you like to take this one yeah no I

1074
00:45:14,290 --> 00:45:15,250
don't I don't think you should

1075
00:45:15,250 --> 00:45:20,020
differentiate I have I have these store

1076
00:45:20,020 --> 00:45:23,920
I have many stories as well and many

1077
00:45:23,920 --> 00:45:28,390
discussions today at work in regards to

1078
00:45:28,390 --> 00:45:33,700
this this notion of things being dev

1079
00:45:33,700 --> 00:45:36,670
versus UAT versus production and and

1080
00:45:36,670 --> 00:45:37,960
that's the same thing if you traverse

1081
00:45:37,960 --> 00:45:38,890
that to CI

1082
00:45:38,890 --> 00:45:43,870
vs. CD if we if we say that CI is a

1083
00:45:43,870 --> 00:45:46,930
production system and CDs also a

1084
00:45:46,930 --> 00:45:49,090
production system and you are

1085
00:45:49,090 --> 00:45:51,550
essentially using the same user names

1086
00:45:51,550 --> 00:45:53,950
and identities in CI in the CD and

1087
00:45:53,950 --> 00:45:56,680
you're using the same flat network in CI

1088
00:45:56,680 --> 00:45:59,470
and CD and you're using the same data

1089
00:45:59,470 --> 00:46:02,020
then I don't you're just you're just

1090
00:46:02,020 --> 00:46:03,730
creating friction and you're just

1091
00:46:03,730 --> 00:46:05,800
creating a whole lot of operational

1092
00:46:05,800 --> 00:46:08,080
overhead to split the two up if you

1093
00:46:08,080 --> 00:46:10,480
indeed have separate identities and

1094
00:46:10,480 --> 00:46:13,000
separate secrets and and you have a very

1095
00:46:13,000 --> 00:46:15,280
strong kind of segregated network and

1096
00:46:15,280 --> 00:46:17,830
you have a very very very good kind of

1097
00:46:17,830 --> 00:46:20,680
automated you know some kind of octopus

1098
00:46:20,680 --> 00:46:22,150
deployment where you're kind of pulling

1099
00:46:22,150 --> 00:46:24,400
things from one area and then pushing

1100
00:46:24,400 --> 00:46:26,380
them into another if you've got that

1101
00:46:26,380 --> 00:46:27,850
kind of segregation and it makes sense

1102
00:46:27,850 --> 00:46:29,740
and I I would say

1103
00:46:29,740 --> 00:46:32,260
look back and think about is it

1104
00:46:32,260 --> 00:46:33,970
beneficial what kind of level of

1105
00:46:33,970 --> 00:46:35,920
security do you want to achieve what

1106
00:46:35,920 --> 00:46:36,520
fret

1107
00:46:36,520 --> 00:46:38,710
are you actually facing here so because

1108
00:46:38,710 --> 00:46:40,570
I can tell you if if that's what you're

1109
00:46:40,570 --> 00:46:42,160
really thinking about you must have a

1110
00:46:42,160 --> 00:46:46,869
fantastic the secure organization if the

1111
00:46:46,869 --> 00:46:47,710
one thing that you're actually

1112
00:46:47,710 --> 00:46:49,480
discussing is whether we should they're

1113
00:46:49,480 --> 00:46:52,869
split out CI to CD III I can think of a

1114
00:46:52,869 --> 00:46:55,060
hundred things that you can spend your

1115
00:46:55,060 --> 00:46:57,610
time on to prevent a breach then to

1116
00:46:57,610 --> 00:47:01,210
split the CI and CD so yeah that's a

1117
00:47:01,210 --> 00:47:04,380
that's an interesting if people are

1118
00:47:04,380 --> 00:47:07,240
honestly there's a lot you can do other

1119
00:47:07,240 --> 00:47:09,970
than that so for me it's a it's a no I

1120
00:47:09,970 --> 00:47:12,520
don't think it's I don't think the juice

1121
00:47:12,520 --> 00:47:13,890
is worth the squeeze

1122
00:47:13,890 --> 00:47:18,660
[Laughter]

1123
00:47:18,660 --> 00:47:21,580
Katie in your experience as a platform

1124
00:47:21,580 --> 00:47:24,190
engineer and also in in the capacity of

1125
00:47:24,190 --> 00:47:26,020
being a member of the technical

1126
00:47:26,020 --> 00:47:28,540
committee of CN CF what's your view on

1127
00:47:28,540 --> 00:47:32,190
this in terms of do we split the CI CV

1128
00:47:32,190 --> 00:47:38,080
components environments or not that's I

1129
00:47:38,080 --> 00:47:42,220
think a very good question I think in it

1130
00:47:42,220 --> 00:47:44,350
really depends on what you're trying to

1131
00:47:44,350 --> 00:47:47,050
achieve I would say I cannot really give

1132
00:47:47,050 --> 00:47:48,790
an answer like yes you should do it this

1133
00:47:48,790 --> 00:47:50,680
way with the AB way I think it depends a

1134
00:47:50,680 --> 00:47:53,910
lot in the context I feel that

1135
00:47:53,910 --> 00:47:57,670
regardless of if we decide to split or

1136
00:47:57,670 --> 00:48:00,609
not there should be a transition towards

1137
00:48:00,609 --> 00:48:03,400
kind of more modern practices more

1138
00:48:03,400 --> 00:48:07,540
modern kind of abilities to push your

1139
00:48:07,540 --> 00:48:09,550
code from your local environment to your

1140
00:48:09,550 --> 00:48:11,260
production system and through staging

1141
00:48:11,260 --> 00:48:13,480
and dev and so forth so I think

1142
00:48:13,480 --> 00:48:16,180
regardless of what answer is it's more

1143
00:48:16,180 --> 00:48:20,080
of like understanding really if that is

1144
00:48:20,080 --> 00:48:22,600
required I know it's quite quite

1145
00:48:22,600 --> 00:48:24,760
abstract but it's it's kind of an

1146
00:48:24,760 --> 00:48:27,060
abstract question in my merchant lines

1147
00:48:27,060 --> 00:48:30,580
but I think regardless of which which is

1148
00:48:30,580 --> 00:48:32,470
it's used if she really should fill the

1149
00:48:32,470 --> 00:48:35,080
context and it really should have a kind

1150
00:48:35,080 --> 00:48:38,109
of transition towards a more kind of

1151
00:48:38,109 --> 00:48:42,100
innovative way of doing CI CD but this

1152
00:48:42,100 --> 00:48:43,720
definitely should be always in the pipe

1153
00:48:43,720 --> 00:48:45,550
that's always something which should be

1154
00:48:45,550 --> 00:48:47,530
proactively and constantly fought about

1155
00:48:47,530 --> 00:48:52,030
and integrated mm-hmm okay so we've

1156
00:48:52,030 --> 00:48:54,220
talked about testing testing and lots of

1157
00:48:54,220 --> 00:48:56,440
do different security testing different

1158
00:48:56,440 --> 00:48:59,349
security approaches etc and we it was

1159
00:48:59,349 --> 00:49:01,000
mentioned that we need to look at the

1160
00:49:01,000 --> 00:49:03,369
reserves eliminate false positive so

1161
00:49:03,369 --> 00:49:04,960
reducing the friction between the

1162
00:49:04,960 --> 00:49:07,540
testing tools and and the delivery team

1163
00:49:07,540 --> 00:49:14,080
but what is good practice regarding this

1164
00:49:14,080 --> 00:49:18,400
security testing is it a control gate is

1165
00:49:18,400 --> 00:49:22,000
it guidelines is it guardrails I mean

1166
00:49:22,000 --> 00:49:25,090
these are terms I've I've heard and they

1167
00:49:25,090 --> 00:49:26,530
may mean different things to different

1168
00:49:26,530 --> 00:49:30,670
people but should the security test

1169
00:49:30,670 --> 00:49:38,170
results define a pass a go/no-go element

1170
00:49:38,170 --> 00:49:42,040
in terms of the pipeline Wendy let's go

1171
00:49:42,040 --> 00:49:43,950
to you

1172
00:49:43,950 --> 00:49:48,790
sure so I think that question the sort

1173
00:49:48,790 --> 00:49:51,220
of sort of gating aspect of it I think

1174
00:49:51,220 --> 00:49:55,300
it does depend on how much or your your

1175
00:49:55,300 --> 00:49:57,760
kind of organization your development

1176
00:49:57,760 --> 00:50:01,750
organization in terms of their testing

1177
00:50:01,750 --> 00:50:05,339
and more problem more importantly

1178
00:50:05,339 --> 00:50:07,720
remediation you know how you know and

1179
00:50:07,720 --> 00:50:09,339
how do they address their the

1180
00:50:09,339 --> 00:50:11,200
vulnerability whether they are have the

1181
00:50:11,200 --> 00:50:12,310
capability addressing the

1182
00:50:12,310 --> 00:50:16,210
vulnerabilities I think you know I think

1183
00:50:16,210 --> 00:50:21,339
a lot of the development developers

1184
00:50:21,339 --> 00:50:26,200
probably already have a kind of quality

1185
00:50:26,200 --> 00:50:27,820
assessment as there were so it's not

1186
00:50:27,820 --> 00:50:30,190
just necessary it sort of you know other

1187
00:50:30,190 --> 00:50:34,720
QA tests as well that they sort of kind

1188
00:50:34,720 --> 00:50:36,520
of you know that they pass through a

1189
00:50:36,520 --> 00:50:38,920
soft gate I suppose just reading between

1190
00:50:38,920 --> 00:50:41,200
the lines this is so it is a question on

1191
00:50:41,200 --> 00:50:43,150
whether as management through management

1192
00:50:43,150 --> 00:50:48,220
whether we centrally stop a code being

1193
00:50:48,220 --> 00:50:51,760
deployed based on an ability so I think

1194
00:50:51,760 --> 00:50:54,010
if you're doing that and I think you

1195
00:50:54,010 --> 00:50:56,640
probably won't be able to do that

1196
00:50:56,640 --> 00:50:58,050
with the support of your developers

1197
00:50:58,050 --> 00:51:00,210
unless you already have a very very sort

1198
00:51:00,210 --> 00:51:05,970
of mature kind of organization and if if

1199
00:51:05,970 --> 00:51:08,130
you're trying to do it without having

1200
00:51:08,130 --> 00:51:10,410
that you know already where they already

1201
00:51:10,410 --> 00:51:12,090
sort of doing it in the first place I

1202
00:51:12,090 --> 00:51:14,250
think you need to do it like in a sort

1203
00:51:14,250 --> 00:51:19,730
of kind of step by step way so you know

1204
00:51:19,820 --> 00:51:23,580
for the first year you know medium

1205
00:51:23,580 --> 00:51:26,190
vulnerabilities if you if we see it you

1206
00:51:26,190 --> 00:51:27,720
see that you have meaning runner this is

1207
00:51:27,720 --> 00:51:29,070
we're gonna stop you and then the next

1208
00:51:29,070 --> 00:51:31,560
show you sort of get you know get you to

1209
00:51:31,560 --> 00:51:36,600
the well high five high medium no say

1210
00:51:36,600 --> 00:51:38,580
sort of you know in a stepwise manner

1211
00:51:38,580 --> 00:51:40,740
rather than sort of Big Bang because you

1212
00:51:40,740 --> 00:51:43,140
really need their support for that right

1213
00:51:43,140 --> 00:51:46,830
so you see you're just to summarize your

1214
00:51:46,830 --> 00:51:49,380
view it should be a gator control but

1215
00:51:49,380 --> 00:51:53,520
ease then if you want a gator control

1216
00:51:53,520 --> 00:51:56,700
not everything so the way I say that so

1217
00:51:56,700 --> 00:52:00,840
through as a holidays program I did

1218
00:52:00,840 --> 00:52:02,400
quite a lot I did as much market

1219
00:52:02,400 --> 00:52:06,000
research as possible right so gated

1220
00:52:06,000 --> 00:52:09,630
control I don't think it's not everybody

1221
00:52:09,630 --> 00:52:13,080
uses it but if you are if you want to

1222
00:52:13,080 --> 00:52:15,270
implement it it needs to be a step wise

1223
00:52:15,270 --> 00:52:17,400
and you need agreement from your from

1224
00:52:17,400 --> 00:52:19,110
your development teams you kind of said

1225
00:52:19,110 --> 00:52:21,380
hey you're going to do it I think if I

1226
00:52:21,380 --> 00:52:24,090
mean you can try but I'm not sure how

1227
00:52:24,090 --> 00:52:27,000
will that work at forcing people to use

1228
00:52:27,000 --> 00:52:29,280
things has not produced fantastic

1229
00:52:29,280 --> 00:52:32,100
resource in my experience you really

1230
00:52:32,100 --> 00:52:34,770
need their buy-in and I suppose that's a

1231
00:52:34,770 --> 00:52:38,160
culture side of it mmm-hmm indeed let's

1232
00:52:38,160 --> 00:52:40,650
just get one more opinion regarding this

1233
00:52:40,650 --> 00:52:44,990
point as Steve do you wanna have a go

1234
00:52:45,140 --> 00:52:49,020
yeah well it depends on well first of

1235
00:52:49,020 --> 00:52:50,160
all I think you know that

1236
00:52:50,160 --> 00:52:51,870
but in cloud native and the way we're

1237
00:52:51,870 --> 00:52:53,790
moving finding best practice or even

1238
00:52:53,790 --> 00:52:56,310
what that means is we can go with good

1239
00:52:56,310 --> 00:52:58,890
practice that's I'm happy with that term

1240
00:52:58,890 --> 00:53:01,680
some older technology that works I I

1241
00:53:01,680 --> 00:53:04,860
kind of don't mind gating a little bit

1242
00:53:04,860 --> 00:53:07,170
to the to actual production deployment

1243
00:53:07,170 --> 00:53:09,750
if you can define what your

1244
00:53:09,750 --> 00:53:11,700
what a trusted application looks like a

1245
00:53:11,700 --> 00:53:13,560
little bit more beyond CVEs

1246
00:53:13,560 --> 00:53:14,540
and if I were talking about

1247
00:53:14,540 --> 00:53:16,680
containerization have I left everything

1248
00:53:16,680 --> 00:53:18,270
running his route like that would be

1249
00:53:18,270 --> 00:53:20,850
maybe a total no-go right you can you

1250
00:53:20,850 --> 00:53:22,650
can get things pretty vastly wrong by

1251
00:53:22,650 --> 00:53:24,900
default so maybe having some quite what

1252
00:53:24,900 --> 00:53:27,830
I would call no-brainer gates in there

1253
00:53:27,830 --> 00:53:30,540
so that's maybe okay but I think

1254
00:53:30,540 --> 00:53:32,880
starting early and having as many fast

1255
00:53:32,880 --> 00:53:34,500
feedback loops so that you never really

1256
00:53:34,500 --> 00:53:36,630
have to get to that process is is a good

1257
00:53:36,630 --> 00:53:39,510
mechanism something I saw recently which

1258
00:53:39,510 --> 00:53:41,340
I'd never seen before just to throw that

1259
00:53:41,340 --> 00:53:42,510
out there we actually were talking about

1260
00:53:42,510 --> 00:53:45,480
air gapped environments I was with an

1261
00:53:45,480 --> 00:53:46,800
organization that created this kind of

1262
00:53:46,800 --> 00:53:49,170
security Disneyland or it was like a

1263
00:53:49,170 --> 00:53:51,990
plaything pipeline so that you could see

1264
00:53:51,990 --> 00:53:53,700
what happened if there were no gates in

1265
00:53:53,700 --> 00:53:55,950
place or no checks so everything went

1266
00:53:55,950 --> 00:53:58,140
through to kind of a mock production is

1267
00:53:58,140 --> 00:54:01,950
fascinating anyway give developers a bit

1268
00:54:01,950 --> 00:54:05,100
of Education interesting interesting and

1269
00:54:05,100 --> 00:54:07,110
wrong I just want to say just just to

1270
00:54:07,110 --> 00:54:10,500
reassure everybody it's not like I don't

1271
00:54:10,500 --> 00:54:13,970
mean having utterly no dates but have

1272
00:54:13,970 --> 00:54:19,860
possibly yeah it's you really need their

1273
00:54:19,860 --> 00:54:22,170
kind of their support and it's just how

1274
00:54:22,170 --> 00:54:27,810
to get developer support that's the yeah

1275
00:54:27,810 --> 00:54:29,820
please let me know if you if you know a

1276
00:54:29,820 --> 00:54:32,430
way of getting sort of developer buying

1277
00:54:32,430 --> 00:54:34,710
in there more frictionless way as it

1278
00:54:34,710 --> 00:54:38,340
were relationships that's that's what

1279
00:54:38,340 --> 00:54:41,130
it's all about this quick good finding

1280
00:54:41,130 --> 00:54:47,580
cakes that usually works as well how do

1281
00:54:47,580 --> 00:54:50,910
we send it your cake DHL do deliver gate

1282
00:54:50,910 --> 00:54:52,100
46

1283
00:54:52,100 --> 00:54:58,380
do it trust me Bakery cake makes the

1284
00:54:58,380 --> 00:54:59,760
world go around I think this is what we

1285
00:54:59,760 --> 00:55:02,400
don't we need to yeah build cake into

1286
00:55:02,400 --> 00:55:04,410
the pipeline so this is I suppose this

1287
00:55:04,410 --> 00:55:09,270
the communities of practice yeah kind of

1288
00:55:09,270 --> 00:55:11,130
initiative bribed them with pizza and

1289
00:55:11,130 --> 00:55:13,770
beer and yeah sorry I couldn't bribe

1290
00:55:13,770 --> 00:55:16,730
them encourage them

1291
00:55:17,320 --> 00:55:27,770
don't worry we'll cut that out what we

1292
00:55:27,770 --> 00:55:29,120
started by the way just real quick we

1293
00:55:29,120 --> 00:55:31,130
slide the principle of security partners

1294
00:55:31,130 --> 00:55:33,680
not champions so essentially trying to

1295
00:55:33,680 --> 00:55:35,900
work yourself out of a job so if you can

1296
00:55:35,900 --> 00:55:37,310
work yourself out of a job and you don't

1297
00:55:37,310 --> 00:55:38,630
really need security team and everyone's

1298
00:55:38,630 --> 00:55:40,430
a security partner and they can go to

1299
00:55:40,430 --> 00:55:41,840
the security partners in their

1300
00:55:41,840 --> 00:55:43,700
department and their teams then you

1301
00:55:43,700 --> 00:55:45,560
slowly let them getting them to do the

1302
00:55:45,560 --> 00:55:47,570
security work and then you don't you

1303
00:55:47,570 --> 00:55:48,440
don't need to do much and then

1304
00:55:48,440 --> 00:55:50,480
eventually you'll get fired and sacked

1305
00:55:50,480 --> 00:55:51,920
because there's no more work but that's

1306
00:55:51,920 --> 00:55:53,690
great because then everything's nice and

1307
00:55:53,690 --> 00:55:55,760
secure so that should be to get em

1308
00:55:55,760 --> 00:55:58,570
really to work yourself at the job yes

1309
00:55:58,570 --> 00:56:02,240
conscious thing it's yeah I mean because

1310
00:56:02,240 --> 00:56:03,830
the developers you know ultimately

1311
00:56:03,830 --> 00:56:05,540
they're gonna have to they're the people

1312
00:56:05,540 --> 00:56:07,570
on the ground they have to take you know

1313
00:56:07,570 --> 00:56:10,880
we can't we can't hand hold them forever

1314
00:56:10,880 --> 00:56:13,970
so it's it's part of how to worry about

1315
00:56:13,970 --> 00:56:16,580
a job and how to educate them so they

1316
00:56:16,580 --> 00:56:19,130
can actually do it while you're working

1317
00:56:19,130 --> 00:56:20,620
yourself out of a job

1318
00:56:20,620 --> 00:56:24,110
great anyway just to finish this from an

1319
00:56:24,110 --> 00:56:27,610
end user perspective one sentence is I

1320
00:56:27,610 --> 00:56:29,750
completely briefed all of these points

1321
00:56:29,750 --> 00:56:31,310
but I think the most important things

1322
00:56:31,310 --> 00:56:33,770
when actually trying to propagate the

1323
00:56:33,770 --> 00:56:37,340
dedsec ops practice is start small and

1324
00:56:37,340 --> 00:56:39,770
integrate graciously because from our

1325
00:56:39,770 --> 00:56:41,780
point of views we don't want like a

1326
00:56:41,780 --> 00:56:43,820
ginormous pipeline built for us and just

1327
00:56:43,820 --> 00:56:45,980
pushed on us and we have to deal with it

1328
00:56:45,980 --> 00:56:47,720
we want something which we understand

1329
00:56:47,720 --> 00:56:49,130
and with something we can build on top

1330
00:56:49,130 --> 00:56:51,830
of and this is exactly how the practice

1331
00:56:51,830 --> 00:56:53,720
of out core yourself of your own role

1332
00:56:53,720 --> 00:56:55,250
it's gonna because we're gonna have

1333
00:56:55,250 --> 00:56:56,930
these small steps we're gonna learn step

1334
00:56:56,930 --> 00:56:58,610
by step by step you're gonna have this

1335
00:56:58,610 --> 00:56:59,990
coaching culture

1336
00:56:59,990 --> 00:57:02,870
this is gonna be think one of the best

1337
00:57:02,870 --> 00:57:05,210
waves paved roads that we can move

1338
00:57:05,210 --> 00:57:07,730
towards and the developers actually

1339
00:57:07,730 --> 00:57:10,040
agree that they can confirm that and

1340
00:57:10,040 --> 00:57:13,730
cakes o cakes is always better so just

1341
00:57:13,730 --> 00:57:18,830
