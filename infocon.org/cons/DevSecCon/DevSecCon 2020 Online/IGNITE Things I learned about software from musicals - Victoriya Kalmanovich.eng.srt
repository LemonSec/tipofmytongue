so my name is victoria thank you lelon

14
00:00:25,119 --> 00:00:26,720
for the introduction and i'm a software

15
00:00:26,720 --> 00:00:28,160
team leader at spectivo which is a

16
00:00:28,160 --> 00:00:29,359
walmart company

17
00:00:29,359 --> 00:00:32,399
and i'm also a huge musicals fan and

18
00:00:32,399 --> 00:00:33,520
what is a musical

19
00:00:33,520 --> 00:00:35,360
it's a performance which combines song

20
00:00:35,360 --> 00:00:36,559
dance and theater

21
00:00:36,559 --> 00:00:38,000
during every performance you get to

22
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:40,000
experience the entire range of emotions

23
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:43,120
happiness sadness fear hope all these

24
00:00:43,120 --> 00:00:44,879
feelings song dance and theater

25
00:00:44,879 --> 00:00:48,000
are integrated into one amazing act so

26
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:49,920
this one night before the coronavirus

27
00:00:49,920 --> 00:00:51,760
outbreak i went to the theater and while

28
00:00:51,760 --> 00:00:53,600
i was watching a plate hit me

29
00:00:53,600 --> 00:00:56,640
theater is for actors a ballet is for

30
00:00:56,640 --> 00:00:57,520
dancers

31
00:00:57,520 --> 00:01:00,160
a concert is for singers but musical

32
00:01:00,160 --> 00:01:00,800
theater

33
00:01:00,800 --> 00:01:02,399
on the other hand combines all of the

34
00:01:02,399 --> 00:01:04,959
above in order to perform in a musical

35
00:01:04,959 --> 00:01:06,560
you need to do singing dancing and

36
00:01:06,560 --> 00:01:07,439
acting

37
00:01:07,439 --> 00:01:09,040
does this multidisciplinary approach

38
00:01:09,040 --> 00:01:10,720
sound familiar

39
00:01:10,720 --> 00:01:12,240
this is how i feel when i create

40
00:01:12,240 --> 00:01:14,080
software i need to know plenty of

41
00:01:14,080 --> 00:01:16,240
technologies and have people skills and

42
00:01:16,240 --> 00:01:17,680
be familiar with different stacks in

43
00:01:17,680 --> 00:01:19,759
order to stay ahead

44
00:01:19,759 --> 00:01:21,759
so that's a musical and you know in

45
00:01:21,759 --> 00:01:23,280
musical sometimes the leading character

46
00:01:23,280 --> 00:01:24,640
bursts into song about

47
00:01:24,640 --> 00:01:26,640
when in life or where in life they wish

48
00:01:26,640 --> 00:01:27,759
to be when

49
00:01:27,759 --> 00:01:29,520
simba from the lion king wishes to be

50
00:01:29,520 --> 00:01:31,520
king and roxy heart from chicago wishes

51
00:01:31,520 --> 00:01:32,560
to be famous

52
00:01:32,560 --> 00:01:35,200
this song is called the i won song the

53
00:01:35,200 --> 00:01:37,119
iwan song comes early in the first act

54
00:01:37,119 --> 00:01:38,479
when a character sings about their

55
00:01:38,479 --> 00:01:40,720
desires and what motivates them

56
00:01:40,720 --> 00:01:42,320
just like tevye from fiddle around the

57
00:01:42,320 --> 00:01:44,159
roof says if i were a rich man he'd

58
00:01:44,159 --> 00:01:45,759
basically do all of the things

59
00:01:45,759 --> 00:01:47,439
and you know exactly what he's dreaming

60
00:01:47,439 --> 00:01:50,399
of but you the audience won't be able to

61
00:01:50,399 --> 00:01:51,920
relate to the i want song

62
00:01:51,920 --> 00:01:53,439
unless the characters make the song

63
00:01:53,439 --> 00:01:55,439
relatable and how do they do it

64
00:01:55,439 --> 00:01:58,560
by justifying their actions in musicals

65
00:01:58,560 --> 00:02:00,320
the singing characters don't only stand

66
00:02:00,320 --> 00:02:02,159
and sing on the stage they act while

67
00:02:02,159 --> 00:02:04,159
they sing when you're on the stage you

68
00:02:04,159 --> 00:02:06,399
justify your actions and your decisions

69
00:02:06,399 --> 00:02:08,239
in hercules when hercules sings about

70
00:02:08,239 --> 00:02:09,919
going to the distance and finding his

71
00:02:09,919 --> 00:02:10,479
parents

72
00:02:10,479 --> 00:02:12,080
why does he lift his head and look at

73
00:02:12,080 --> 00:02:13,599
the and look at the stars when he talks

74
00:02:13,599 --> 00:02:15,599
about getting help by the gods

75
00:02:15,599 --> 00:02:17,440
in a little shop of horror when audrey

76
00:02:17,440 --> 00:02:19,200
dreams of a house in the suburbs

77
00:02:19,200 --> 00:02:20,560
why does her voice tremble when she

78
00:02:20,560 --> 00:02:22,560
speaks of her future children

79
00:02:22,560 --> 00:02:24,400
every move needs to be justified or it

80
00:02:24,400 --> 00:02:25,520
will look out of place and will

81
00:02:25,520 --> 00:02:27,920
jeopardize the song's credibility

82
00:02:27,920 --> 00:02:29,920
when we make software related decisions

83
00:02:29,920 --> 00:02:31,280
we need to keep in mind that

84
00:02:31,280 --> 00:02:33,840
this also requires justification if we

85
00:02:33,840 --> 00:02:35,519
make a decision to refactor a piece of

86
00:02:35,519 --> 00:02:36,000
code

87
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:38,319
we need to be able to explain why when

88
00:02:38,319 --> 00:02:40,239
we choose to prioritize one task over

89
00:02:40,239 --> 00:02:41,840
the other we need to be able to explain

90
00:02:41,840 --> 00:02:42,480
why

91
00:02:42,480 --> 00:02:44,480
if we're facing issues that keep us from

92
00:02:44,480 --> 00:02:46,480
completing our tasks we need to be able

93
00:02:46,480 --> 00:02:48,000
to explain why

94
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:50,560
this justification really helps everyone

95
00:02:50,560 --> 00:02:52,160
who is working around us

96
00:02:52,160 --> 00:02:54,160
and just like actions on stage this

97
00:02:54,160 --> 00:02:57,120
helps people relate to you better

98
00:02:57,120 --> 00:02:58,879
and when you justify your decisions and

99
00:02:58,879 --> 00:03:00,720
people relate to you better you can get

100
00:03:00,720 --> 00:03:02,640
things done much more effectively

101
00:03:02,640 --> 00:03:04,400
and i know your team probably isn't made

102
00:03:04,400 --> 00:03:06,000
of a cowardly lion a heartless

103
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:07,519
tin man and a brainless scarecrow

104
00:03:07,519 --> 00:03:09,040
following you blindly

105
00:03:09,040 --> 00:03:10,800
but you can still be a dorothy and lead

106
00:03:10,800 --> 00:03:11,920
it over the rainbow when you're

107
00:03:11,920 --> 00:03:14,239
delivering code and features

108
00:03:14,239 --> 00:03:16,000
we always talk about ownership and

109
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:17,280
impact in my company

110
00:03:17,280 --> 00:03:19,040
we don't believe in half a process

111
00:03:19,040 --> 00:03:20,959
there's no just structured piece of code

112
00:03:20,959 --> 00:03:22,959
and now it's somebody else's problem

113
00:03:22,959 --> 00:03:25,360
we are our own future owners and so the

114
00:03:25,360 --> 00:03:27,440
end to end responsibility is ours

115
00:03:27,440 --> 00:03:29,040
if i need to get something done and i

116
00:03:29,040 --> 00:03:31,440
depend on other people i'm the dorothy

117
00:03:31,440 --> 00:03:33,040
i have to find a way to motivate the

118
00:03:33,040 --> 00:03:35,040
people i need they aren't necessarily on

119
00:03:35,040 --> 00:03:36,799
my team i might need cooperation from

120
00:03:36,799 --> 00:03:38,239
another product manager

121
00:03:38,239 --> 00:03:40,239
a different qa teammates from parallel

122
00:03:40,239 --> 00:03:42,319
teams or any other stakeholder

123
00:03:42,319 --> 00:03:44,480
i am responsible to driving my team to

124
00:03:44,480 --> 00:03:46,000
success there's no place

125
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:47,760
like home and there's no sense like

126
00:03:47,760 --> 00:03:49,599
ownership

127
00:03:49,599 --> 00:03:51,200
another thing we can learn from i want

128
00:03:51,200 --> 00:03:52,959
songs is the distinction between the

129
00:03:52,959 --> 00:03:54,799
short and the long run

130
00:03:54,799 --> 00:03:56,560
when you write your eye one song what

131
00:03:56,560 --> 00:03:58,799
will it say look ahead and think

132
00:03:58,799 --> 00:04:00,720
where are you going professionally do

133
00:04:00,720 --> 00:04:02,080
you want to be the best people manager

134
00:04:02,080 --> 00:04:03,120
in the world

135
00:04:03,120 --> 00:04:04,640
do you want to be such a great architect

136
00:04:04,640 --> 00:04:06,239
that your name will precede you do you

137
00:04:06,239 --> 00:04:08,239
want to be a keynote speaker

138
00:04:08,239 --> 00:04:10,560
remember tracy from hairspray she wants

139
00:04:10,560 --> 00:04:12,319
more than anything to be a star

140
00:04:12,319 --> 00:04:13,680
from the moment she understands that she

141
00:04:13,680 --> 00:04:15,840
needs to work hard and convince everyone

142
00:04:15,840 --> 00:04:17,519
she's the right person for a tv show

143
00:04:17,519 --> 00:04:17,918
role

144
00:04:17,918 --> 00:04:19,759
to be on track to becoming a star

145
00:04:19,759 --> 00:04:21,120
there's nothing that can stop her from

146
00:04:21,120 --> 00:04:22,079
getting there

147
00:04:22,079 --> 00:04:23,680
this approach can be life-changing for

148
00:04:23,680 --> 00:04:26,080
us we get so caught up in our short-term

149
00:04:26,080 --> 00:04:26,479
goals

150
00:04:26,479 --> 00:04:28,000
that we don't allow ourselves to think

151
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:30,160
long term understanding our long-term

152
00:04:30,160 --> 00:04:31,759
goals is as important as

153
00:04:31,759 --> 00:04:34,080
short-term goals so make sure you set

154
00:04:34,080 --> 00:04:35,600
these goals alongside a plan

155
00:04:35,600 --> 00:04:38,479
of how to get there and what comes after

156
00:04:38,479 --> 00:04:39,600
the i1 song

157
00:04:39,600 --> 00:04:42,400
yes the i'm great song the i'm great

158
00:04:42,400 --> 00:04:44,320
song is sung by someone who can't sing

159
00:04:44,320 --> 00:04:45,600
an iwan song because

160
00:04:45,600 --> 00:04:47,440
there's nothing left for them to want

161
00:04:47,440 --> 00:04:49,040
they're accomplished popular and

162
00:04:49,040 --> 00:04:51,040
undisputed masters of their field

163
00:04:51,040 --> 00:04:52,720
it's mostly sung by villains but we can

164
00:04:52,720 --> 00:04:54,840
all learn a thing or two from a musical

165
00:04:54,840 --> 00:04:57,360
villain and just like tomato from moana

166
00:04:57,360 --> 00:04:58,720
says i'm too shiny

167
00:04:58,720 --> 00:05:00,320
watch me dazzle like a diamond in the

168
00:05:00,320 --> 00:05:02,400
rough strut my stuff my stuff is so

169
00:05:02,400 --> 00:05:05,280
shiny when you get to this point it's

170
00:05:05,280 --> 00:05:06,880
either you know all there is to know in

171
00:05:06,880 --> 00:05:07,840
the software world

172
00:05:07,840 --> 00:05:09,520
or you've settled really well in your

173
00:05:09,520 --> 00:05:11,440
comfort zone either way

174
00:05:11,440 --> 00:05:12,960
it's a great point to reach because it's

175
00:05:12,960 --> 00:05:14,560
probably your careers junction and you

176
00:05:14,560 --> 00:05:16,320
get to reflect and calculate your next

177
00:05:16,320 --> 00:05:18,400
steps which is always fun

178
00:05:18,400 --> 00:05:21,360
so in conclusion write your own i1 song

179
00:05:21,360 --> 00:05:23,120
justify yourself along the way

180
00:05:23,120 --> 00:05:25,120
own your decisions and take the lead

181
00:05:25,120 --> 00:05:26,880
don't forget to think long term

182
00:05:26,880 --> 00:05:28,960
take the time to reflect and eventually

183
00:05:28,960 --> 00:05:30,720
you'll sing your own great song

184
00:05:30,720 --> 00:05:32,479

185
00:05:32,479 --> 00:05:34,560
