1
00:00:00,170 --> 00:00:02,520
awesome thank you very much hello

2
00:00:02,520 --> 00:00:05,069
everyone thank you for joining to

3
00:00:05,069 --> 00:00:07,529
Chihuahua session today

4
00:00:07,529 --> 00:00:09,179
my name is Fernando Cardozo I'm a

5
00:00:09,179 --> 00:00:13,080
Solutions Architect for Trend Micro it's

6
00:00:13,080 --> 00:00:15,210
a global cyber security company right

7
00:00:15,210 --> 00:00:17,100
and I just would like to be talking to

8
00:00:17,100 --> 00:00:18,660
you today about the benefits of

9
00:00:18,660 --> 00:00:20,609
continuous security and compliance for

10
00:00:20,609 --> 00:00:23,340
our cloud infrastructure right so let's

11
00:00:23,340 --> 00:00:26,400
get it start when we talk about like

12
00:00:26,400 --> 00:00:29,939
cloud right most of time there is these

13
00:00:29,939 --> 00:00:33,000
three major cloud strategies right when

14
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:35,610
we the first one is what we call cloud

15
00:00:35,610 --> 00:00:38,040
migration right and collaboration is

16
00:00:38,040 --> 00:00:40,590
just like the lift and shift it's

17
00:00:40,590 --> 00:00:42,360
getting the regular virtual machine

18
00:00:42,360 --> 00:00:44,789
physical servers and migrates to the

19
00:00:44,789 --> 00:00:47,280
cloud a lot of components also they use

20
00:00:47,280 --> 00:00:49,469
the monolithic application that they

21
00:00:49,469 --> 00:00:51,360
have in their data center right and

22
00:00:51,360 --> 00:00:54,090
migrates to the cloud workloads the

23
00:00:54,090 --> 00:00:56,910
second step is very very important and a

24
00:00:56,910 --> 00:00:58,260
lot of companies right now they are

25
00:00:58,260 --> 00:01:00,570
applying those specifically aspects

26
00:01:00,570 --> 00:01:03,270
right from like FN tags to startups and

27
00:01:03,270 --> 00:01:05,400
the companies that they are trying to

28
00:01:05,400 --> 00:01:07,439
innovate with the air applications it's

29
00:01:07,439 --> 00:01:09,479
why we call cloud native applications

30
00:01:09,479 --> 00:01:12,000
and when we starting to talk about cloud

31
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:13,560
native application we start to talk

32
00:01:13,560 --> 00:01:16,290
about containers server less cloud

33
00:01:16,290 --> 00:01:18,630
storage and all those type of things it

34
00:01:18,630 --> 00:01:21,090
is it it's another important aspect

35
00:01:21,090 --> 00:01:23,070
about the cloud native application is

36
00:01:23,070 --> 00:01:25,320
the breaking down of the monolithic

37
00:01:25,320 --> 00:01:27,720
application to micro service they

38
00:01:27,720 --> 00:01:28,950
starting breaking down those

39
00:01:28,950 --> 00:01:30,780
applications they start using containers

40
00:01:30,780 --> 00:01:33,090
serve less and give all your negative

41
00:01:33,090 --> 00:01:35,640
applications right if this is the second

42
00:01:35,640 --> 00:01:38,880
and the most important I think in the

43
00:01:38,880 --> 00:01:41,670
three major strategies the other one

44
00:01:41,670 --> 00:01:43,920
that a lot of people don't talk about it

45
00:01:43,920 --> 00:01:46,140
is the governance and operational

46
00:01:46,140 --> 00:01:49,439
excellence and in this is specifically

47
00:01:49,439 --> 00:01:52,500
point it is important to remember the

48
00:01:52,500 --> 00:01:55,229
governance and excellence right they are

49
00:01:55,229 --> 00:01:57,659
making sure you are following the best

50
00:01:57,659 --> 00:02:00,000
practice you are applying the compliance

51
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,759
that your company needs you are removing

52
00:02:02,759 --> 00:02:05,369
the security risk in the early stage you

53
00:02:05,369 --> 00:02:07,500
are trying to get the better performance

54
00:02:07,500 --> 00:02:10,050
in operation from the applications right

55
00:02:10,050 --> 00:02:12,690
and if you go like a little bit more in

56
00:02:12,690 --> 00:02:13,350
deep

57
00:02:13,350 --> 00:02:16,140
in the calibration excellence rate we

58
00:02:16,140 --> 00:02:18,840
see like this regular pipeline and this

59
00:02:18,840 --> 00:02:21,180
pipeline can be used by like the regular

60
00:02:21,180 --> 00:02:22,620
applications with the devops

61
00:02:22,620 --> 00:02:24,660
applications or for infrastructure as a

62
00:02:24,660 --> 00:02:28,170
code a lot of people always mention the

63
00:02:28,170 --> 00:02:31,020
devops pipelines but I started seeing

64
00:02:31,020 --> 00:02:33,360
couple companies using different like

65
00:02:33,360 --> 00:02:35,640
pipelines one for applications and one

66
00:02:35,640 --> 00:02:37,500
for infrastructure let's talk a little

67
00:02:37,500 --> 00:02:40,290
bit more in this specifically in this

68
00:02:40,290 --> 00:02:42,240
specific case about the infrastructure

69
00:02:42,240 --> 00:02:46,350
right there is a couple examples that

70
00:02:46,350 --> 00:02:48,420
they put here but one of the important

71
00:02:48,420 --> 00:02:50,070
ones that they would like to bring it up

72
00:02:50,070 --> 00:02:52,770
it is the many teams using cloud service

73
00:02:52,770 --> 00:02:56,250
right so many like business units they

74
00:02:56,250 --> 00:02:58,140
are innovating they're trying to create

75
00:02:58,140 --> 00:03:00,210
the new applications and they are

76
00:03:00,210 --> 00:03:02,070
migrating and using cloud native

77
00:03:02,070 --> 00:03:04,740
applications right the other part

78
00:03:04,740 --> 00:03:07,500
important aspect on that it is they let

79
00:03:07,500 --> 00:03:09,930
their lack of visibility right for

80
00:03:09,930 --> 00:03:12,480
example when visitors units is starting

81
00:03:12,480 --> 00:03:14,250
creating those applications in the cloud

82
00:03:14,250 --> 00:03:16,890
they starting losing some kind of like

83
00:03:16,890 --> 00:03:19,650
visibility of those applications because

84
00:03:19,650 --> 00:03:21,360
they don't have the same way to

85
00:03:21,360 --> 00:03:23,250
monitoring those applications that they

86
00:03:23,250 --> 00:03:25,470
have before in the data center and it's

87
00:03:25,470 --> 00:03:27,690
important also to provide the compliance

88
00:03:27,690 --> 00:03:31,230
that so many companies request right the

89
00:03:31,230 --> 00:03:32,640
first case here will be the Miss

90
00:03:32,640 --> 00:03:35,430
configuration for cloud formation

91
00:03:35,430 --> 00:03:37,980
templates right a lot of people forget

92
00:03:37,980 --> 00:03:40,860
or they don't have the usual like a

93
00:03:40,860 --> 00:03:43,380
scanning process or template scanner for

94
00:03:43,380 --> 00:03:45,870
the cloud formation before the building

95
00:03:45,870 --> 00:03:48,840
production environment right couple

96
00:03:48,840 --> 00:03:50,790
other case would be cross account access

97
00:03:50,790 --> 00:03:52,740
to the repository sometimes they have

98
00:03:52,740 --> 00:03:55,260
the the permission open to the internet

99
00:03:55,260 --> 00:03:56,790
or open to the public

100
00:03:56,790 --> 00:04:00,330
or some other for example applications

101
00:04:00,330 --> 00:04:02,160
are accessing the repository and they

102
00:04:02,160 --> 00:04:04,680
should not write they have the gem room

103
00:04:04,680 --> 00:04:08,070
apply it for the wrong service the other

104
00:04:08,070 --> 00:04:10,740
use case could be the open storage to

105
00:04:10,740 --> 00:04:12,930
the internet like s3 bucket it's a good

106
00:04:12,930 --> 00:04:15,630
example right people sometimes making

107
00:04:15,630 --> 00:04:17,880
some specifically mistakes or Mis

108
00:04:17,880 --> 00:04:20,730
configuration in the a3 bucket and the

109
00:04:20,730 --> 00:04:22,108
last one that I would like to bring is

110
00:04:22,108 --> 00:04:24,810
the cube rotation some compliance they

111
00:04:24,810 --> 00:04:27,180
request you to rotate your keys every

112
00:04:27,180 --> 00:04:30,060
days or every like 60 or 90 days right

113
00:04:30,060 --> 00:04:32,160
depends which specifically compliance

114
00:04:32,160 --> 00:04:34,860
we're falling or the your company

115
00:04:34,860 --> 00:04:38,610
requests one uh one of the important

116
00:04:38,610 --> 00:04:40,199
aspects when you start to talk about

117
00:04:40,199 --> 00:04:42,419
infrastructure as a code back in the day

118
00:04:42,419 --> 00:04:45,150
for you to create like a server link

119
00:04:45,150 --> 00:04:47,789
takes like forever right for example you

120
00:04:47,789 --> 00:04:50,190
need to request the server you need to

121
00:04:50,190 --> 00:04:53,039
put that in the hack you need to install

122
00:04:53,039 --> 00:04:54,720
the operation system you need to install

123
00:04:54,720 --> 00:04:57,360
the applications and that could takes

124
00:04:57,360 --> 00:04:59,849
between like days two weeks or two

125
00:04:59,849 --> 00:05:04,320
months right depends how how much we

126
00:05:04,320 --> 00:05:07,470
work like for you to buy the service in

127
00:05:07,470 --> 00:05:08,970
your new york company

128
00:05:08,970 --> 00:05:10,590
I saw a specifically cases in big

129
00:05:10,590 --> 00:05:13,199
financial service right where they takes

130
00:05:13,199 --> 00:05:15,389
like months to just create like a new

131
00:05:15,389 --> 00:05:18,150
server into your data center but the

132
00:05:18,150 --> 00:05:19,650
infrastructure as a code is very

133
00:05:19,650 --> 00:05:22,259
important because make it like much

134
00:05:22,259 --> 00:05:24,300
easier for companies to start degrading

135
00:05:24,300 --> 00:05:27,150
their infrastructure with like a simple

136
00:05:27,150 --> 00:05:30,570
template file that can recreate they can

137
00:05:30,570 --> 00:05:34,260
make it repeatable they can control they

138
00:05:34,260 --> 00:05:36,030
can make like specifically change in

139
00:05:36,030 --> 00:05:38,729
their teams right and I want to let you

140
00:05:38,729 --> 00:05:41,419
break like the three major points why

141
00:05:41,419 --> 00:05:43,710
infrastructures of codes is growing so

142
00:05:43,710 --> 00:05:46,560
fast right now in the market right the

143
00:05:46,560 --> 00:05:48,870
first one is they speed for example back

144
00:05:48,870 --> 00:05:50,430
in the day is like a month to create

145
00:05:50,430 --> 00:05:52,470
like a virtual machine but right now is

146
00:05:52,470 --> 00:05:54,389
like seconds or could be like minutes

147
00:05:54,389 --> 00:05:58,020
right the second is important aspect is

148
00:05:58,020 --> 00:06:01,370
the control because a template

149
00:06:01,370 --> 00:06:04,349
confirmation template or a RM templates

150
00:06:04,349 --> 00:06:07,500
or terraform templates they are the

151
00:06:07,500 --> 00:06:09,930
regular text files right and you can

152
00:06:09,930 --> 00:06:12,630
save those files in the teet repository

153
00:06:12,630 --> 00:06:14,759
and in the github repository you can

154
00:06:14,759 --> 00:06:17,400
enable the versioning process who

155
00:06:17,400 --> 00:06:19,979
changed specifically files what was the

156
00:06:19,979 --> 00:06:22,320
change and a couple other controls that

157
00:06:22,320 --> 00:06:24,300
you can get from the key to a post story

158
00:06:24,300 --> 00:06:26,750
today it's a very important aspect right

159
00:06:26,750 --> 00:06:29,820
the third one is the consistence right

160
00:06:29,820 --> 00:06:32,400
and the consistent has deep can make

161
00:06:32,400 --> 00:06:34,169
more repeatable

162
00:06:34,169 --> 00:06:35,550
right for example you don't have the

163
00:06:35,550 --> 00:06:37,650
problem of like a human a or

164
00:06:37,650 --> 00:06:39,070
somebody that gets

165
00:06:39,070 --> 00:06:42,430
like in the back into the the the

166
00:06:42,430 --> 00:06:45,310
company after like a long day right and

167
00:06:45,310 --> 00:06:47,050
they are pretty tired and they started

168
00:06:47,050 --> 00:06:48,490
making like some mistakes in the

169
00:06:48,490 --> 00:06:50,620
configuration no you are being basted in

170
00:06:50,620 --> 00:06:53,310
the template and that template can be

171
00:06:53,310 --> 00:06:56,320
repeatable like multiple times with but

172
00:06:56,320 --> 00:06:58,300
without changing the environment right

173
00:06:58,300 --> 00:07:02,230
this is pretty important aspect and when

174
00:07:02,230 --> 00:07:04,810
we talk about with customers they they

175
00:07:04,810 --> 00:07:07,690
bring to us like couple use cases about

176
00:07:07,690 --> 00:07:10,390
their challenge right the first use case

177
00:07:10,390 --> 00:07:12,490
of the challenge when they are using for

178
00:07:12,490 --> 00:07:13,900
structures occult is like the

179
00:07:13,900 --> 00:07:16,150
immigration of like regulated

180
00:07:16,150 --> 00:07:18,790
applications or regulated workloads for

181
00:07:18,790 --> 00:07:21,120
example imagine you have a PCI DSS

182
00:07:21,120 --> 00:07:23,530
application and in your data center

183
00:07:23,530 --> 00:07:25,750
anyone immigrates that to the cloud

184
00:07:25,750 --> 00:07:28,090
right it's like sometimes can be a

185
00:07:28,090 --> 00:07:30,160
little bit tricky a little bit hard but

186
00:07:30,160 --> 00:07:31,660
for example if you are using the

187
00:07:31,660 --> 00:07:35,140
property perfect solutions for that it's

188
00:07:35,140 --> 00:07:37,410
like much easier than you think right

189
00:07:37,410 --> 00:07:40,630
that's one point large environment

190
00:07:40,630 --> 00:07:43,030
visibility every single company right

191
00:07:43,030 --> 00:07:45,010
now they have what they call business

192
00:07:45,010 --> 00:07:47,050
units right they have the development

193
00:07:47,050 --> 00:07:49,720
teams that have the DevOps teams they

194
00:07:49,720 --> 00:07:52,390
have a lot of different engineering team

195
00:07:52,390 --> 00:07:54,520
to build those applications right and

196
00:07:54,520 --> 00:07:56,560
most of the time there's like business

197
00:07:56,560 --> 00:07:59,470
units they have like one or more cloud

198
00:07:59,470 --> 00:08:00,940
accounts could it be like you need a

199
00:08:00,940 --> 00:08:03,910
blast you CP measure or any other cloud

200
00:08:03,910 --> 00:08:06,340
provider right and they are basically

201
00:08:06,340 --> 00:08:08,530
not just like in one cloud service there

202
00:08:08,530 --> 00:08:10,840
be basins like many cloud service it

203
00:08:10,840 --> 00:08:12,940
could be like a three buckets could be

204
00:08:12,940 --> 00:08:15,520
like a lambda functions could be like

205
00:08:15,520 --> 00:08:18,190
any service in any cloud provider in so

206
00:08:18,190 --> 00:08:21,610
on right and one important aspect about

207
00:08:21,610 --> 00:08:23,560
that like you have a large environment a

208
00:08:23,560 --> 00:08:26,410
large number of like a SS or count

209
00:08:26,410 --> 00:08:29,740
accounts and how you make sure you are

210
00:08:29,740 --> 00:08:31,990
only the best practice that you define

211
00:08:31,990 --> 00:08:33,580
internally and externally

212
00:08:33,580 --> 00:08:35,890
like for example AWS well Architects

213
00:08:35,890 --> 00:08:39,460
rating work CIS benchmark as your well

214
00:08:39,460 --> 00:08:41,229
architect and so many other best

215
00:08:41,229 --> 00:08:43,719
practice frameworks that they have in

216
00:08:43,719 --> 00:08:44,740
the market right now

217
00:08:44,740 --> 00:08:47,020
the other important aspect is the

218
00:08:47,020 --> 00:08:49,750
continuous compliance if you have your

219
00:08:49,750 --> 00:08:51,950
regulated application and you want to

220
00:08:51,950 --> 00:08:54,589
to the cloud you have a specifically

221
00:08:54,589 --> 00:08:56,779
thing that a lot of people forget is the

222
00:08:56,779 --> 00:08:59,170
share responsibility right for example

223
00:08:59,170 --> 00:09:02,029
when you go to the cloud provider is

224
00:09:02,029 --> 00:09:03,920
there is a shares possibility that where

225
00:09:03,920 --> 00:09:06,860
they show you what is the responsibility

226
00:09:06,860 --> 00:09:09,220
from the provider and what is your

227
00:09:09,220 --> 00:09:11,690
responsibility as a customer to make

228
00:09:11,690 --> 00:09:14,029
sure your application in your data are

229
00:09:14,029 --> 00:09:17,750
running with the PCI DSS compliance

230
00:09:17,750 --> 00:09:21,350
HIPAA compliance ISO 27000 compliance

231
00:09:21,350 --> 00:09:24,050
and so many others right it's important

232
00:09:24,050 --> 00:09:27,680
to always look for those for challenge

233
00:09:27,680 --> 00:09:29,540
that like a lot of customers are having

234
00:09:29,540 --> 00:09:34,300
today and if we go a little bit more in

235
00:09:34,300 --> 00:09:38,389
micro like details here like this is the

236
00:09:38,389 --> 00:09:41,449
top 5 configuration failures right bases

237
00:09:41,449 --> 00:09:43,490
in the customer challenge and if you see

238
00:09:43,490 --> 00:09:46,130
here first one storage access second one

239
00:09:46,130 --> 00:09:49,760
secret management for the keys right a

240
00:09:49,760 --> 00:09:52,820
lot of systems with like a disabled

241
00:09:52,820 --> 00:09:55,730
monitoring or disable logging in the

242
00:09:55,730 --> 00:09:58,640
systems you have an over overly

243
00:09:58,640 --> 00:10:01,519
permissive access to host containers and

244
00:10:01,519 --> 00:10:04,519
virtual machines and the last one is the

245
00:10:04,519 --> 00:10:07,970
lack of validation it is very important

246
00:10:07,970 --> 00:10:11,089
not just like validate your production

247
00:10:11,089 --> 00:10:13,160
environment but find it also your

248
00:10:13,160 --> 00:10:15,440
infrastructure the code before you build

249
00:10:15,440 --> 00:10:17,870
those environments right and if you see

250
00:10:17,870 --> 00:10:22,790
here in the Gartner through 20 2023 99%

251
00:10:22,790 --> 00:10:25,010
of the cloud security failures will be

252
00:10:25,010 --> 00:10:27,350
because the customer thought it's

253
00:10:27,350 --> 00:10:31,720
important to remember that through 2024

254
00:10:31,720 --> 00:10:34,459
organizations will be using CSP M as a

255
00:10:34,459 --> 00:10:36,680
way to fix those misconfigurations

256
00:10:36,680 --> 00:10:39,440
problems in the cloud and this is wild

257
00:10:39,440 --> 00:10:41,000
train marker bought like a crowd

258
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:43,550
conformity last year and we rebranded as

259
00:10:43,550 --> 00:10:46,190
a child 1 conformity this is a cloud

260
00:10:46,190 --> 00:10:49,130
security platform to breed to help to

261
00:10:49,130 --> 00:10:51,529
bridge the gaps between security teams

262
00:10:51,529 --> 00:10:54,350
and DevOps teams right the rebel RCS

263
00:10:54,350 --> 00:10:56,839
pm's technologies they only see in their

264
00:10:56,839 --> 00:10:57,589
runtime

265
00:10:57,589 --> 00:10:59,510
right and then one through the the

266
00:10:59,510 --> 00:11:01,730
production environment but we also can

267
00:11:01,730 --> 00:11:04,259
bring in shift tool at security for the

268
00:11:04,259 --> 00:11:07,109
it meant that the development side and

269
00:11:07,109 --> 00:11:11,759
the CI cd2 side for example and this is

270
00:11:11,759 --> 00:11:13,649
a couple other additional features that

271
00:11:13,649 --> 00:11:15,720
we have with cloud one conforming first

272
00:11:15,720 --> 00:11:18,839
one we have over 600 Rouge tags and

273
00:11:18,839 --> 00:11:21,269
conforming platform today we do know

274
00:11:21,269 --> 00:11:24,479
like over 500 million daily best

275
00:11:24,479 --> 00:11:27,059
practice checks in our platform we have

276
00:11:27,059 --> 00:11:29,579
a real-time security monitoring and we

277
00:11:29,579 --> 00:11:32,699
also provide like 12 global templates

278
00:11:32,699 --> 00:11:35,699
for customers like a PCI DSS HIPAA

279
00:11:35,699 --> 00:11:39,660
compliance ISO 27001 and so many other

280
00:11:39,660 --> 00:11:44,009
templates ok and here it's like a fool

281
00:11:44,009 --> 00:11:46,319
infrastructure is a cold pipeline where

282
00:11:46,319 --> 00:11:49,289
you can see we can deliver like a

283
00:11:49,289 --> 00:11:51,149
specifically security plug-in for your

284
00:11:51,149 --> 00:11:53,970
IDE with yes code and give you feedback

285
00:11:53,970 --> 00:11:56,129
in real time for development the

286
00:11:56,129 --> 00:11:59,249
developers and these can help you to be

287
00:11:59,249 --> 00:12:01,529
seamless right it could be like much

288
00:12:01,529 --> 00:12:03,839
simple to deliver security in the

289
00:12:03,839 --> 00:12:06,389
development side instead to go and start

290
00:12:06,389 --> 00:12:08,160
enforcing them to use the specifically

291
00:12:08,160 --> 00:12:10,559
tools this is a plugin that they can use

292
00:12:10,559 --> 00:12:13,769
in the vs code and they are like daily

293
00:12:13,769 --> 00:12:15,629
technology that they use every single

294
00:12:15,629 --> 00:12:17,910
day to build infrastructure Zarko to

295
00:12:17,910 --> 00:12:20,579
view the new applications right the

296
00:12:20,579 --> 00:12:22,619
second step is the template scanner and

297
00:12:22,619 --> 00:12:26,100
we use the API communicate like a forum

298
00:12:26,100 --> 00:12:28,739
twist in every single confirmation

299
00:12:28,739 --> 00:12:30,989
before you create those environments we

300
00:12:30,989 --> 00:12:33,119
also deliver

301
00:12:33,119 --> 00:12:36,209
github actions integration where you can

302
00:12:36,209 --> 00:12:38,809
see in our portal you can see in the

303
00:12:38,809 --> 00:12:42,269
github marketplace right and the last

304
00:12:42,269 --> 00:12:44,039
piece is like the integration with

305
00:12:44,039 --> 00:12:46,429
continued support ticketing systems and

306
00:12:46,429 --> 00:12:48,419
communication technologies like

307
00:12:48,419 --> 00:12:52,109
Microsoft teams is lag and if you detect

308
00:12:52,109 --> 00:12:53,970
specifically changed in production

309
00:12:53,970 --> 00:12:56,970
environment and in the real time also we

310
00:12:56,970 --> 00:12:59,039
can create a specifically tickets for

311
00:12:59,039 --> 00:13:00,689
service now JIRA

312
00:13:00,689 --> 00:13:02,699
major duties in desk and so many other

313
00:13:02,699 --> 00:13:04,289
technologies ok

314
00:13:04,289 --> 00:13:07,379
the second piece here is like like I

315
00:13:07,379 --> 00:13:09,899
mentioned the IDE integration right you

316
00:13:09,899 --> 00:13:12,959
can use the care code and go to the vs

317
00:13:12,959 --> 00:13:15,560
code marketplace download that and

318
00:13:15,560 --> 00:13:18,440
start using pretty fast just registry an

319
00:13:18,440 --> 00:13:18,830
hour

320
00:13:18,830 --> 00:13:22,279
conformally Porto is free for 14 days

321
00:13:22,279 --> 00:13:25,520
and it can be scan in your confirmation

322
00:13:25,520 --> 00:13:28,790
like this way the the image in the left

323
00:13:28,790 --> 00:13:31,520
it is a regular confirmation and the

324
00:13:31,520 --> 00:13:34,670
image in the right is there like the

325
00:13:34,670 --> 00:13:36,620
template scanning reports that we can

326
00:13:36,620 --> 00:13:39,320
provide we give like a little summary

327
00:13:39,320 --> 00:13:42,080
the detection the risk levels and the

328
00:13:42,080 --> 00:13:44,210
link to our knowledge based check out

329
00:13:44,210 --> 00:13:47,050
that I think would be very helpful okay

330
00:13:47,050 --> 00:13:50,540
a couple more informations that you can

331
00:13:50,540 --> 00:13:53,600
see that specifically link it is some

332
00:13:53,600 --> 00:13:55,970
kind of like details about the audit how

333
00:13:55,970 --> 00:13:58,339
you can out it through the CLI and

334
00:13:58,339 --> 00:14:00,170
through the interface and also how you

335
00:14:00,170 --> 00:14:02,540
can make the remediation it is a very

336
