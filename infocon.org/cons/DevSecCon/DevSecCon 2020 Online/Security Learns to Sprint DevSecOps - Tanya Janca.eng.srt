1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:03,000
okay awesome hi everyone I am Tanya

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:05,790
Dinka and today I'm going to talk to you

3
00:00:05,790 --> 00:00:09,030
about what dedsec Ops is things are

4
00:00:09,030 --> 00:00:11,099
changing and we have security people we

5
00:00:11,099 --> 00:00:12,630
need to change the way we are doing

6
00:00:12,630 --> 00:00:14,910
things and so I am going to talk about

7
00:00:14,910 --> 00:00:18,529
how security needs to learn to sprint so

8
00:00:18,529 --> 00:00:22,260
alright so I like to tell you what I'm

9
00:00:22,260 --> 00:00:24,810
gonna tell you then tell you then repeat

10
00:00:24,810 --> 00:00:26,670
what I told you to make sure that you

11
00:00:26,670 --> 00:00:29,820
get it and you know it so we're going to

12
00:00:29,820 --> 00:00:31,590
talk about how security is everybody's

13
00:00:31,590 --> 00:00:34,739
job so the security team can't actually

14
00:00:34,739 --> 00:00:37,050
do every single security activity so a

15
00:00:37,050 --> 00:00:39,329
lot of our work is enabling others to be

16
00:00:39,329 --> 00:00:41,129
able to do their jobs securely

17
00:00:41,129 --> 00:00:46,940
um I'm also going to talk about how

18
00:00:46,940 --> 00:00:50,730
DevOps can be turned into devstack ops

19
00:00:50,730 --> 00:00:54,329
and how security becomes a part of

20
00:00:54,329 --> 00:00:57,539
DevOps that's what devstack offices it

21
00:00:57,539 --> 00:00:59,609
is us as application security

22
00:00:59,609 --> 00:01:02,309
professionals adjusting ourselves and

23
00:01:02,309 --> 00:01:04,110
our activities to make sure that they

24
00:01:04,110 --> 00:01:06,479
leave nicely through the processes that

25
00:01:06,479 --> 00:01:08,729
all the dev and ops people are doing so

26
00:01:08,729 --> 00:01:13,530
no more gates no more stopping things or

27
00:01:13,530 --> 00:01:16,229
say no all the time instead we have to

28
00:01:16,229 --> 00:01:18,900
do a bit more improv and say yes I know

29
00:01:18,900 --> 00:01:20,369
you need to accomplish this business

30
00:01:20,369 --> 00:01:22,229
goal but let me help you do that at

31
00:01:22,229 --> 00:01:24,119
security so the other thing we're going

32
00:01:24,119 --> 00:01:26,970
to talk about is how some people in

33
00:01:26,970 --> 00:01:30,090
security see DevOps they see the magical

34
00:01:30,090 --> 00:01:33,479
DevOps unicorn who picking rainbows

35
00:01:33,479 --> 00:01:34,920
because they're so amazing and then

36
00:01:34,920 --> 00:01:36,689
security people some of them feel

37
00:01:36,689 --> 00:01:39,689
they're cleaning up but that's that's

38
00:01:39,689 --> 00:01:43,079
not what I see thanks to Francois who

39
00:01:43,079 --> 00:01:45,450
you just saw he made this amazing

40
00:01:45,450 --> 00:01:47,430
beautiful slide that I absolutely love

41
00:01:47,430 --> 00:01:50,610
where the security person is enabling

42
00:01:50,610 --> 00:01:54,329
the magical devops ponies and they're

43
00:01:54,329 --> 00:01:56,689
you know giving other tools helping them

44
00:01:56,689 --> 00:01:59,430
teaching them enabling them and this is

45
00:01:59,430 --> 00:02:01,710
the way I've been in a dev site house so

46
00:02:01,710 --> 00:02:03,509
there is going to be this very positive

47
00:02:03,509 --> 00:02:06,360
slant on this just in case you couldn't

48
00:02:06,360 --> 00:02:09,149
tell that's what was coming I'm so the

49
00:02:09,149 --> 00:02:11,970
mandatory about me slide so look there a

50
00:02:11,970 --> 00:02:15,420
add another deficit comment so I'm Tanya

51
00:02:15,420 --> 00:02:16,140
Jenkin

52
00:02:16,140 --> 00:02:19,530
the internet so I like punk rock music a

53
00:02:19,530 --> 00:02:21,600
lot on the Internet

54
00:02:21,600 --> 00:02:24,540
I am known as she hacks purple yes some

55
00:02:24,540 --> 00:02:26,250
of my hair is purple because I'm a

56
00:02:26,250 --> 00:02:29,160
purple team err like I do red and blue

57
00:02:29,160 --> 00:02:31,350
team activities so attack and defense

58
00:02:31,350 --> 00:02:34,380
types of activities so purple team means

59
00:02:34,380 --> 00:02:39,360
you can't make up your mind I am really

60
00:02:39,360 --> 00:02:41,280
obsessed with I lost the open web

61
00:02:41,280 --> 00:02:44,490
application security project I am one of

62
00:02:44,490 --> 00:02:47,040
the founders and am very enthusiastic

63
00:02:47,040 --> 00:02:50,550
about will sack women of security and I

64
00:02:50,550 --> 00:02:53,160
work at my company if she likes purple

65
00:02:53,160 --> 00:02:57,210
death oh yeah so I hope after seeing

66
00:02:57,210 --> 00:02:58,800
this you're like yeah she seems worth

67
00:02:58,800 --> 00:03:00,900
listening to I'm gonna stay awesome

68
00:03:00,900 --> 00:03:05,100
let's do this okay so let's learn some

69
00:03:05,100 --> 00:03:08,790
stuff so I'm going to give you a few

70
00:03:08,790 --> 00:03:11,010
definitions because I never know the

71
00:03:11,010 --> 00:03:13,560
level of knowledge of the people that

72
00:03:13,560 --> 00:03:16,290
are coming to my presentations and so

73
00:03:16,290 --> 00:03:17,820
this will just take one or two minutes

74
00:03:17,820 --> 00:03:20,100
to make sure we're on the same page and

75
00:03:20,100 --> 00:03:22,020
then we're going to jump into cool new

76
00:03:22,020 --> 00:03:24,320
stuff so application security

77
00:03:24,320 --> 00:03:28,500
definitions so what is access I say apps

78
00:03:28,500 --> 00:03:31,190
a lot instead of application security

79
00:03:31,190 --> 00:03:36,000
because it's shorter so every activity

80
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:40,590
that you do towards the goal of making

81
00:03:40,590 --> 00:03:43,560
your software more secure is absent it

82
00:03:43,560 --> 00:03:45,360
doesn't need to be super formal you can

83
00:03:45,360 --> 00:03:47,610
have an application security program

84
00:03:47,610 --> 00:03:51,420
that's formal but if you are hiring a

85
00:03:51,420 --> 00:03:54,120
pen tester to come in and assess the

86
00:03:54,120 --> 00:03:56,580
security of a web app that's part of

87
00:03:56,580 --> 00:03:59,670
that sec if you are looking through your

88
00:03:59,670 --> 00:04:02,340
source code and you realize oh this

89
00:04:02,340 --> 00:04:04,800
but it has no validation on it oh my

90
00:04:04,800 --> 00:04:05,370
gosh

91
00:04:05,370 --> 00:04:07,739
and then you got some that's pretty bad

92
00:04:07,739 --> 00:04:09,810
sack it doesn't need to be really formal

93
00:04:09,810 --> 00:04:14,010
oh it is fighting the good fight and so

94
00:04:14,010 --> 00:04:16,858
that is what I consider enveloped in

95
00:04:16,858 --> 00:04:20,279
application security and then I want to

96
00:04:20,279 --> 00:04:23,610
tell you why it's a bit of a problem so

97
00:04:23,610 --> 00:04:25,950
application and insecure applications

98
00:04:25,950 --> 00:04:28,260
cause between 29 and 40 percent of

99
00:04:28,260 --> 00:04:30,930
breaches um I haven't updated this slide

100
00:04:30,930 --> 00:04:33,570
but the Verizon breach report continues

101
00:04:33,570 --> 00:04:38,010
every year and so we won the worst place

102
00:04:38,010 --> 00:04:39,840
or first place of causing the most

103
00:04:39,840 --> 00:04:45,169
breaches in 2016-17 2018 and now 2019

104
00:04:45,169 --> 00:04:49,139
I want us to lose and not win this

105
00:04:49,139 --> 00:04:53,580
anymore and oh and here's here's one of

106
00:04:53,580 --> 00:04:56,340
the this is from 2016 look at us causing

107
00:04:56,340 --> 00:04:59,220
all the problems um another reason for

108
00:04:59,220 --> 00:05:01,200
this is because application security is

109
00:05:01,200 --> 00:05:03,840
missing in schools post-secondary

110
00:05:03,840 --> 00:05:06,479
education they're teaching people how to

111
00:05:06,479 --> 00:05:07,890
code but they're not teaching them how

112
00:05:07,890 --> 00:05:11,100
to code securely and even in high

113
00:05:11,100 --> 00:05:12,810
schools they're teaching them you know

114
00:05:12,810 --> 00:05:14,310
hello world but they're not teaching

115
00:05:14,310 --> 00:05:16,380
them how to sanitize that input that

116
00:05:16,380 --> 00:05:19,919
they're getting and so quite often the

117
00:05:19,919 --> 00:05:22,140
security courses that they get is just

118
00:05:22,140 --> 00:05:23,910
it's not enough to ensure that those

119
00:05:23,910 --> 00:05:25,530
software developers are making secure

120
00:05:25,530 --> 00:05:29,520
software another issue in our industry

121
00:05:29,520 --> 00:05:31,139
right now is the security as I

122
00:05:31,139 --> 00:05:32,970
remembered see her see how she's all

123
00:05:32,970 --> 00:05:33,360
alone

124
00:05:33,360 --> 00:05:35,760
that's me when I'm on like so many

125
00:05:35,760 --> 00:05:39,060
access teams I am that sec team the

126
00:05:39,060 --> 00:05:42,450
whole to you and us being a member it

127
00:05:42,450 --> 00:05:44,250
makes it really really hard for us to do

128
00:05:44,250 --> 00:05:46,560
a good job so if we look at some of the

129
00:05:46,560 --> 00:05:50,060
numbers they're approximately ten

130
00:05:50,060 --> 00:05:53,400
operations folk and 100 software

131
00:05:53,400 --> 00:05:54,990
developers for everyone the security

132
00:05:54,990 --> 00:05:56,850
person and I've never worked somewhere

133
00:05:56,850 --> 00:05:58,169
where my numbers were actually this

134
00:05:58,169 --> 00:06:01,590
great it's usually hundreds of devs just

135
00:06:01,590 --> 00:06:04,350
for me and that means you can't just

136
00:06:04,350 --> 00:06:07,860
work you can't just work harder you have

137
00:06:07,860 --> 00:06:12,690
to work smarter and the last thing in

138
00:06:12,690 --> 00:06:14,780
this is water

139
00:06:14,780 --> 00:06:19,070
all so software developers are moving in

140
00:06:19,070 --> 00:06:22,750
droves towards DevOps because it works

141
00:06:22,750 --> 00:06:24,680
it works so well

142
00:06:24,680 --> 00:06:27,230
waterfall projects in software

143
00:06:27,230 --> 00:06:29,660
development not with construction or

144
00:06:29,660 --> 00:06:31,280
with hardware it works well for those

145
00:06:31,280 --> 00:06:36,230
but for software it around 70% I saw in

146
00:06:36,230 --> 00:06:39,440
a study fail that's a lot of failed

147
00:06:39,440 --> 00:06:42,770
projects and at the security model that

148
00:06:42,770 --> 00:06:46,220
went with it not good not good and so

149
00:06:46,220 --> 00:06:48,500
now that dev and ops have like Joint

150
00:06:48,500 --> 00:06:50,660
Forces I want us to join forces with

151
00:06:50,660 --> 00:06:55,490
them and not only be awesome at making

152
00:06:55,490 --> 00:06:58,040
kick-ass software I wants to make a

153
00:06:58,040 --> 00:07:02,660
kick-ass software that's secure ok so

154
00:07:02,660 --> 00:07:05,180
what is deficit cost what is she talking

155
00:07:05,180 --> 00:07:07,460
about what is everyone talking about

156
00:07:07,460 --> 00:07:10,580
this entire conference for 24 hours so

157
00:07:10,580 --> 00:07:12,410
my friend Imran said this you tired

158
00:07:12,410 --> 00:07:14,360
wrong give the keynote rep AIPAC

159
00:07:14,360 --> 00:07:16,460
he's awesome if you didn't see it you

160
00:07:16,460 --> 00:07:19,370
should watch it later he's amazing so he

161
00:07:19,370 --> 00:07:20,330
taught me this

162
00:07:20,330 --> 00:07:23,540
he's like Tonya dedsec Ops is what we've

163
00:07:23,540 --> 00:07:26,360
always done it's just us doing acts SEC

164
00:07:26,360 --> 00:07:30,320
but in a DevOps environment do just

165
00:07:30,320 --> 00:07:32,150
change the way you do the things but we

166
00:07:32,150 --> 00:07:34,220
shoot for the same goals and I was like

167
00:07:34,220 --> 00:07:37,220
gosh this guy's so smart and then I

168
00:07:37,220 --> 00:07:41,990
became his friend so now I'm gonna talk

169
00:07:41,990 --> 00:07:45,979
about what DevOps is and how their main

170
00:07:45,979 --> 00:07:50,210
goals fit in with the security's goals a

171
00:07:50,210 --> 00:07:52,430
lot of people don't think of it that but

172
00:07:52,430 --> 00:07:54,740
their goals actually mesh really nicely

173
00:07:54,740 --> 00:07:58,160
with what we want and so that's why we

174
00:07:58,160 --> 00:08:02,510
should be besties so first of all DevOps

175
00:08:02,510 --> 00:08:04,700
people want improve deployment frequency

176
00:08:04,700 --> 00:08:08,690
right there they want this so that

177
00:08:08,690 --> 00:08:13,190
there's less risk right what I see is oh

178
00:08:13,190 --> 00:08:15,950
good security emergencies can be fixed

179
00:08:15,950 --> 00:08:18,169
right now that's awesome so if there's

180
00:08:18,169 --> 00:08:21,260
actually an emergency you can you can

181
00:08:21,260 --> 00:08:23,690
get that out right away like a true

182
00:08:23,690 --> 00:08:25,669
emergency not you're missing this one

183
00:08:25,669 --> 00:08:27,999
security header on this one page

184
00:08:27,999 --> 00:08:30,399
um I worked somewhere once in a

185
00:08:30,399 --> 00:08:33,759
waterfall shop and our release cycle was

186
00:08:33,759 --> 00:08:39,938
16 months and an emergency the sky is

187
00:08:39,938 --> 00:08:43,179
falling situation they said they could

188
00:08:43,179 --> 00:08:46,389
get a release so in four months and to

189
00:08:46,389 --> 00:08:50,649
me when I saw DevOps it's like much

190
00:08:50,649 --> 00:08:53,050
I can't tell you how enthusiastic I was

191
00:08:53,050 --> 00:08:56,139
as a security professional okay lower

192
00:08:56,139 --> 00:08:58,779
failure rates that sounds awesome too

193
00:08:58,779 --> 00:09:00,790
right okay

194
00:09:00,790 --> 00:09:04,149
so what they call it is resiliency but

195
00:09:04,149 --> 00:09:07,569
if we look at I'm sure you all know this

196
00:09:07,569 --> 00:09:09,910
this is the mandate for IT security the

197
00:09:09,910 --> 00:09:11,889
CIA triad

198
00:09:11,889 --> 00:09:14,829
it is our jobs we get paid specifically

199
00:09:14,829 --> 00:09:17,250
to protect protect the confidentiality

200
00:09:17,250 --> 00:09:20,610
the integrity and the availability of

201
00:09:20,610 --> 00:09:23,649
the systems and the data that we create

202
00:09:23,649 --> 00:09:26,259
and collect that's our job and if you

203
00:09:26,259 --> 00:09:31,290
look at availability that's almost like

204
00:09:31,290 --> 00:09:38,110
it means resiliency if your app is

205
00:09:38,110 --> 00:09:40,089
always up because this tough and it's

206
00:09:40,089 --> 00:09:40,569
rugged

207
00:09:40,569 --> 00:09:42,279
that means it's always available and

208
00:09:42,279 --> 00:09:44,860
that is security people resting really

209
00:09:44,860 --> 00:09:48,850
well at night so this is good so we are

210
00:09:48,850 --> 00:09:50,740
still on the same page with these DevOps

211
00:09:50,740 --> 00:09:52,870
folks we still be like where they're

212
00:09:52,870 --> 00:09:55,569
going with this so there's one more main

213
00:09:55,569 --> 00:09:59,170
thing that they aim for faster

214
00:09:59,170 --> 00:10:01,779
time-to-market I've had a lot of people

215
00:10:01,779 --> 00:10:04,329
stay Tonya I don't see how this relates

216
00:10:04,329 --> 00:10:08,949
and I have to disagree there is no

217
00:10:08,949 --> 00:10:12,339
security team if there's no business I

218
00:10:12,339 --> 00:10:15,639
don't have a job if we are not releasing

219
00:10:15,639 --> 00:10:18,519
software I have actually given talks to

220
00:10:18,519 --> 00:10:20,920
security teams before as the consultant

221
00:10:20,920 --> 00:10:22,750
explaining to them that they were the

222
00:10:22,750 --> 00:10:25,269
main threats to availability with all

223
00:10:25,269 --> 00:10:27,160
their gates that they kept pushing up

224
00:10:27,160 --> 00:10:29,019
I'm like we will go out of business if

225
00:10:29,019 --> 00:10:32,829
we follow your guidance we have to

226
00:10:32,829 --> 00:10:34,569
release we have to create products we

227
00:10:34,569 --> 00:10:37,300
have to release features if your job to

228
00:10:37,300 --> 00:10:38,980
help us make sure we do that securely

229
00:10:38,980 --> 00:10:40,810
it's not your job to

230
00:10:40,810 --> 00:10:45,460
us and so security doesn't win if the

231
00:10:45,460 --> 00:10:49,240
business doesn't win we lose then when

232
00:10:49,240 --> 00:10:53,050
we all get laid off and so I feel that

233
00:10:53,050 --> 00:10:57,130
faster time-to-market as long as we are

234
00:10:57,130 --> 00:11:00,250
still able to ensure that it's secure is

235
00:11:00,250 --> 00:11:03,610
a win for everyone and also I feel as a

236
00:11:03,610 --> 00:11:06,460
side note that security is a feature now

237
00:11:06,460 --> 00:11:08,380
people are interested consumers are

238
00:11:08,380 --> 00:11:10,510
interested in knowing like this product

239
00:11:10,510 --> 00:11:12,520
has had security testing my parents

240
00:11:12,520 --> 00:11:15,550
bought a TV and it was a smart TV and I

241
00:11:15,550 --> 00:11:17,470
was like well you have to only buy the

242
00:11:17,470 --> 00:11:19,690
Smart TV that has actually had security

243
00:11:19,690 --> 00:11:22,930
testing done on it because you know and

244
00:11:22,930 --> 00:11:25,270
they were so proud that they the TV that

245
00:11:25,270 --> 00:11:27,300
had the security testing guys like yes

246
00:11:27,300 --> 00:11:29,620
because otherwise I was gonna make them

247
00:11:29,620 --> 00:11:32,050
take it back to the store um but the

248
00:11:32,050 --> 00:11:35,080
point is is like we don't win we as a

249
00:11:35,080 --> 00:11:36,910
security team we lose it's a business

250
00:11:36,910 --> 00:11:38,260
loses okay

251
00:11:38,260 --> 00:11:42,940
so now we know oh yeah this is another

252
00:11:42,940 --> 00:11:46,570
quote from me I feel DevOps is the best

253
00:11:46,570 --> 00:11:48,520
thing to happen to application security

254
00:11:48,520 --> 00:11:51,610
since the open web security project I

255
00:11:51,610 --> 00:11:54,640
feel like a wasp is amazing offering

256
00:11:54,640 --> 00:11:57,160
like the projects offering so much

257
00:11:57,160 --> 00:11:59,890
opportunity tools books learning all

258
00:11:59,890 --> 00:12:02,110
these things and the chapters around the

259
00:12:02,110 --> 00:12:04,270
world constantly teaching people helping

260
00:12:04,270 --> 00:12:08,740
them network DevOps is the it's the best

261
00:12:08,740 --> 00:12:12,339
thing since that and I that is the

262
00:12:12,339 --> 00:12:15,339
highest compliment that I can pay as an

263
00:12:15,339 --> 00:12:20,740
OSP nerd and enthusiast okay so now that

264
00:12:20,740 --> 00:12:23,020
we think that we want the same things

265
00:12:23,020 --> 00:12:27,580
that DevOps folks what how do we how do

266
00:12:27,580 --> 00:12:28,660
we make that a reality

267
00:12:28,660 --> 00:12:31,300
so we need to learn the three ways of

268
00:12:31,300 --> 00:12:35,110
DevOps so there are three ways basically

269
00:12:35,110 --> 00:12:37,330
things that we need to do to make sure

270
00:12:37,330 --> 00:12:39,190
that we're actually doing them so DevOps

271
00:12:39,190 --> 00:12:42,459
is not just we installed some pipeline

272
00:12:42,459 --> 00:12:45,970
software and like one of the dev teams

273
00:12:45,970 --> 00:12:50,860
is using it we do DevOps nope I disagree

274
00:12:50,860 --> 00:12:52,910
I read the devil

275
00:12:52,910 --> 00:12:56,360
handbook the Phoenix project the uniform

276
00:12:56,360 --> 00:12:58,850
project and accelerate which are all

277
00:12:58,850 --> 00:13:01,130
awesome books which I should share a

278
00:13:01,130 --> 00:13:03,680
link at the end actually to a book

279
00:13:03,680 --> 00:13:05,840
review I wrote about them but the

280
00:13:05,840 --> 00:13:07,960
basically the blog post has just me

281
00:13:07,960 --> 00:13:12,110
fangirling but basically all of these

282
00:13:12,110 --> 00:13:14,720
books written by a whole bunch of

283
00:13:14,720 --> 00:13:17,300
brilliant humans that like were part of

284
00:13:17,300 --> 00:13:20,420
the start and like perfection perfecting

285
00:13:20,420 --> 00:13:23,750
of the DevOps movement the idea is is it

286
00:13:23,750 --> 00:13:25,700
if you have these three things that then

287
00:13:25,700 --> 00:13:27,620
you're doing DevOps so the first thing

288
00:13:27,620 --> 00:13:30,800
is you need to emphasize the efficiency

289
00:13:30,800 --> 00:13:34,580
of the entire system and not just your

290
00:13:34,580 --> 00:13:37,550
part so I've worked out lots of places

291
00:13:37,550 --> 00:13:40,550
where we have big silos and quite often

292
00:13:40,550 --> 00:13:42,980
if you could break those silos down you

293
00:13:42,980 --> 00:13:45,050
might see you oh I my parts actually

294
00:13:45,050 --> 00:13:46,730
really quite efficient and fast right

295
00:13:46,730 --> 00:13:46,970
now

296
00:13:46,970 --> 00:13:49,010
I should go lend a hand at this other

297
00:13:49,010 --> 00:13:51,320
part so that I can start receiving

298
00:13:51,320 --> 00:13:54,980
things quicker and that is what it

299
00:13:54,980 --> 00:13:56,660
focuses on efficiency of the entire

300
00:13:56,660 --> 00:13:59,150
system not just your part so sometimes

301
00:13:59,150 --> 00:14:00,530
it means going and working with other

302
00:14:00,530 --> 00:14:03,350
teams which is really important the next

303
00:14:03,350 --> 00:14:06,260
one is fast feedback loops so we want

304
00:14:06,260 --> 00:14:08,960
feedback now that is white waterfall

305
00:14:08,960 --> 00:14:11,270
doesn't work out so often because you

306
00:14:11,270 --> 00:14:13,280
don't get feedback until after you know

307
00:14:13,280 --> 00:14:16,280
nine months or a year and your clients

308
00:14:16,280 --> 00:14:17,420
first of all things might have changed

309
00:14:17,420 --> 00:14:19,130
your client has changed our opinion

310
00:14:19,130 --> 00:14:21,470
there's just so many you could be on the

311
00:14:21,470 --> 00:14:23,600
wrong path and quite often there's

312
00:14:23,600 --> 00:14:24,710
misunderstandings and miscommunications

313
00:14:24,710 --> 00:14:26,780
and if you can get feedback constantly

314
00:14:26,780 --> 00:14:30,380
that means you can save so much time and

315
00:14:30,380 --> 00:14:32,840
money and heartache and then the last

316
00:14:32,840 --> 00:14:37,060
one is continuous learning risk-taking

317
00:14:37,060 --> 00:14:39,950
experimentation failing fast and

318
00:14:39,950 --> 00:14:43,790
spending time working on improving your

319
00:14:43,790 --> 00:14:46,550
daily work so I wish that there was one

320
00:14:46,550 --> 00:14:48,830
fancy word that I could used for that

321
00:14:48,830 --> 00:14:51,440
but the idea is is that if we don't try

322
00:14:51,440 --> 00:14:53,540
things won't know if there's like a

323
00:14:53,540 --> 00:14:55,910
better way for us to do it so run an

324
00:14:55,910 --> 00:14:58,220
experiment like where you take metrics

325
00:14:58,220 --> 00:15:00,470
and then you see like oh actually this

326
00:15:00,470 --> 00:15:02,030
tool is actually way more effective than

327
00:15:02,030 --> 00:15:03,710
that tool or we could put these two

328
00:15:03,710 --> 00:15:04,870
tools together

329
00:15:04,870 --> 00:15:06,010
and then we would get even better

330
00:15:06,010 --> 00:15:08,290
results and if you don't take the time

331
00:15:08,290 --> 00:15:12,040
to remove your daily work then you'll

332
00:15:12,040 --> 00:15:13,750
just keep doing things the old way and

333
00:15:13,750 --> 00:15:16,120
that is definitely not what DevOps is

334
00:15:16,120 --> 00:15:20,230
about okay so now that's now like I've

335
00:15:20,230 --> 00:15:22,420
kind of given a brief overview of the

336
00:15:22,420 --> 00:15:24,520
three ways of DevOps now I want to talk

337
00:15:24,520 --> 00:15:27,360
about specific actions that you could do

338
00:15:27,360 --> 00:15:32,110
to go kick butt at this all right first

339
00:15:32,110 --> 00:15:35,140
the first way emphasize the efficiency

340
00:15:35,140 --> 00:15:37,930
of the entire system so some people call

341
00:15:37,930 --> 00:15:41,770
this left-to-right or speed or see my

342
00:15:41,770 --> 00:15:45,790
super fancy animation right obviously I

343
00:15:45,790 --> 00:15:48,190
should work for Pixar someday my amazing

344
00:15:48,190 --> 00:15:48,700
skills

345
00:15:48,700 --> 00:15:52,330
I'm a sarcastic but the point is is that

346
00:15:52,330 --> 00:15:55,330
we want to go fast so below that so that

347
00:15:55,330 --> 00:15:57,730
image at the bottom the little arrows is

348
00:15:57,730 --> 00:16:00,190
the system development lifecycle

349
00:16:00,190 --> 00:16:02,470
you must have requirements you just to

350
00:16:02,470 --> 00:16:04,360
know what you're building because now

351
00:16:04,360 --> 00:16:05,830
that software developers will build you

352
00:16:05,830 --> 00:16:07,510
something but it won't be what you want

353
00:16:07,510 --> 00:16:09,540
if you don't give them clear guidance

354
00:16:09,540 --> 00:16:12,160
then you know you need to design plan

355
00:16:12,160 --> 00:16:14,260
out what you're doing you code and test

356
00:16:14,260 --> 00:16:18,490
your release and DevOps can do this it's

357
00:16:18,490 --> 00:16:21,850
amazing but the point is is efficiency

358
00:16:21,850 --> 00:16:25,000
and speed so what does this mean for

359
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:30,760
Devon ops it means first of all we need

360
00:16:30,760 --> 00:16:33,400
your help we really really do we as

361
00:16:33,400 --> 00:16:35,770
security people need your help assisting

362
00:16:35,770 --> 00:16:37,360
and tuning our tools because we don't

363
00:16:37,360 --> 00:16:38,830
want to waste your time we don't want to

364
00:16:38,830 --> 00:16:40,060
give you false positives

365
00:16:40,060 --> 00:16:45,580
it means reusing known good code so if

366
00:16:45,580 --> 00:16:47,500
you have a secure coding library using

367
00:16:47,500 --> 00:16:48,940
those code samples instead of

368
00:16:48,940 --> 00:16:52,330
reinventing the wheel it means you know

369
00:16:52,330 --> 00:16:53,770
if you're going to release a container

370
00:16:53,770 --> 00:16:55,660
make sure that's up-to-date up-to-date

371
00:16:55,660 --> 00:16:58,630
or scanned before you release it rather

372
00:16:58,630 --> 00:17:01,779
than releasing the same image all month

373
00:17:01,779 --> 00:17:03,790
you know updating those containers so

374
00:17:03,790 --> 00:17:05,730
that you have the newest thing that day

375
00:17:05,730 --> 00:17:09,670
making negative unit tests so I'll talk

376
00:17:09,670 --> 00:17:12,010
a little bit about that but basically if

377
00:17:12,010 --> 00:17:13,060
you're gonna write a whole bunch of

378
00:17:13,060 --> 00:17:15,189
units has work with your security team

379
00:17:15,189 --> 00:17:17,950
to ensure some of those units

380
00:17:17,950 --> 00:17:22,030
help you fail gracefully so test that

381
00:17:22,030 --> 00:17:24,420
your application can handle bad input

382
00:17:24,420 --> 00:17:29,620
gracefully we need your help running so

383
00:17:29,620 --> 00:17:31,180
I'm going to talk about an asynchronous

384
00:17:31,180 --> 00:17:33,730
security pipeline so we need you to

385
00:17:33,730 --> 00:17:38,470
participate in that and most of all the

386
00:17:38,470 --> 00:17:40,060
thing that we need from the Devon ops

387
00:17:40,060 --> 00:17:43,120
team is the permission to fail the build

388
00:17:43,120 --> 00:17:46,480
if we find a real secure a serious

389
00:17:46,480 --> 00:17:50,320
security flaw that's the thing we need

390
00:17:50,320 --> 00:17:52,030
the most for you but this talk is not

391
00:17:52,030 --> 00:17:54,730
really aimed at Devon ops this talk is

392
00:17:54,730 --> 00:17:58,690
aimed at the security team so I'm going

393
00:17:58,690 --> 00:18:00,400
to give you so there's seven slides

394
00:18:00,400 --> 00:18:03,790
where I do the photos slide and this is

395
00:18:03,790 --> 00:18:05,470
where you can take a screenshot so if

396
00:18:05,470 --> 00:18:08,470
you're on an Apple computer you press

397
00:18:08,470 --> 00:18:09,880
the command a button in the control

398
00:18:09,880 --> 00:18:12,340
button and then the number four and then

399
00:18:12,340 --> 00:18:15,190
just drag across and then you have all

400
00:18:15,190 --> 00:18:17,200
your notes because I personally don't

401
00:18:17,200 --> 00:18:19,120
like typing notes while I'm listening

402
00:18:19,120 --> 00:18:20,820
I've trouble doing both at the same time

403
00:18:20,820 --> 00:18:25,450
so I made these for you but this talk is

404
00:18:25,450 --> 00:18:30,090
more about security so this what does

405
00:18:30,090 --> 00:18:32,170
efficiency of the entire system and

406
00:18:32,170 --> 00:18:34,060
speed mean for security it means we

407
00:18:34,060 --> 00:18:37,480
cannot slow down things we can't be a

408
00:18:37,480 --> 00:18:39,460
gauge and we cannot break the build

409
00:18:39,460 --> 00:18:43,240
unless it's really serious right we

410
00:18:43,240 --> 00:18:45,760
can't break the build because so I love

411
00:18:45,760 --> 00:18:47,830
security headers but we can't break the

412
00:18:47,830 --> 00:18:51,520
build over one security header I mean I

413
00:18:51,520 --> 00:18:55,510
love them so it means we need to learn

414
00:18:55,510 --> 00:18:59,050
to fit our work into Sprint's if Devon

415
00:18:59,050 --> 00:19:00,820
ops are using Sprint's so if they're

416
00:19:00,820 --> 00:19:03,550
doing three week time intervals where

417
00:19:03,550 --> 00:19:05,920
they release their code that means we

418
00:19:05,920 --> 00:19:08,110
need to figure out how to do our work in

419
00:19:08,110 --> 00:19:10,930
those three weeks time intervals so we

420
00:19:10,930 --> 00:19:13,360
can't do like a six week code review

421
00:19:13,360 --> 00:19:15,670
because the code has the code base has

422
00:19:15,670 --> 00:19:17,320
completely changed in that time that's

423
00:19:17,320 --> 00:19:19,240
not effective so we need to review only

424
00:19:19,240 --> 00:19:22,120
parts of it or adjust ourselves in ways

425
00:19:22,120 --> 00:19:27,010
so that that works and we need to focus

426
00:19:27,010 --> 00:19:28,690
on improving C

427
00:19:28,690 --> 00:19:30,880
for all the different value streams and

428
00:19:30,880 --> 00:19:33,880
show them how we're adding value to the

429
00:19:33,880 --> 00:19:36,400
end product we can't say because I said

430
00:19:36,400 --> 00:19:38,950
so that doesn't work unless you're

431
00:19:38,950 --> 00:19:40,270
talking to a two-year-old

432
00:19:40,270 --> 00:19:42,190
and most software developers are

433
00:19:42,190 --> 00:19:44,800
significantly older than two so we need

434
00:19:44,800 --> 00:19:46,240
to treat them like the adults they are

435
00:19:46,240 --> 00:19:48,940
and actually explain you know why the

436
00:19:48,940 --> 00:19:53,110
RISC matters and exactly what we need

437
00:19:53,110 --> 00:19:57,040
from them um yeah so we can't have Devon

438
00:19:57,040 --> 00:19:59,440
ops just waiting on us all the time we

439
00:19:59,440 --> 00:20:04,930
can't be the bottleneck we really we

440
00:20:04,930 --> 00:20:07,060
need to work within their processes and

441
00:20:07,060 --> 00:20:10,030
if we are creating our own processes we

442
00:20:10,030 --> 00:20:11,890
need to make sure it works with theirs I

443
00:20:11,890 --> 00:20:14,940
have seen so many security professionals

444
00:20:14,940 --> 00:20:18,550
who care a lot but they are thinking it

445
00:20:18,550 --> 00:20:20,410
outside their own box and you know for

446
00:20:20,410 --> 00:20:22,890
instance creating an 80 page

447
00:20:22,890 --> 00:20:24,850
architecture document that they're

448
00:20:24,850 --> 00:20:27,310
expecting teams to fill out and I never

449
00:20:27,310 --> 00:20:29,590
get to fill them that's not happening

450
00:20:29,590 --> 00:20:31,750
let's create processes that actually

451
00:20:31,750 --> 00:20:35,800
work that enable them to create secure

452
00:20:35,800 --> 00:20:38,940
software um so the next one is I

453
00:20:38,940 --> 00:20:41,320
mentioned this briefly on the last slide

454
00:20:41,320 --> 00:20:43,840
but like we can break up our work into

455
00:20:43,840 --> 00:20:45,700
smaller pieces so that it fits into our

456
00:20:45,700 --> 00:20:48,430
sprint so let's go back to code review

457
00:20:48,430 --> 00:20:51,640
you know review code in one for one

458
00:20:51,640 --> 00:20:54,240
feature or for just the new code or

459
00:20:54,240 --> 00:20:56,890
break up the application into different

460
00:20:56,890 --> 00:21:00,280
sections with different goals you can do

461
00:21:00,280 --> 00:21:02,620
this with your your dynamic application

462
00:21:02,620 --> 00:21:04,780
security testing you can do this with

463
00:21:04,780 --> 00:21:06,610
threat modeling there's so many ways

464
00:21:06,610 --> 00:21:08,140
that you can break things into smaller

465
00:21:08,140 --> 00:21:11,140
pieces it's also extremely important

466
00:21:11,140 --> 00:21:13,690
that we tune our tools and retune them

467
00:21:13,690 --> 00:21:15,700
and listen to Devon ops when they give

468
00:21:15,700 --> 00:21:18,400
us feedback if they're telling us you

469
00:21:18,400 --> 00:21:21,340
know this is not working well for us

470
00:21:21,340 --> 00:21:25,090
this is not helping us we need to listen

471
00:21:25,090 --> 00:21:29,680
and then adjust right because because we

472
00:21:29,680 --> 00:21:30,970
won't because they'll go around us

473
00:21:30,970 --> 00:21:32,020
because they have the power

474
00:21:32,020 --> 00:21:34,390
software developers make something out

475
00:21:34,390 --> 00:21:36,160
of nothing every day and they don't have

476
00:21:36,160 --> 00:21:37,930
to wait for us they're doing it because

477
00:21:37,930 --> 00:21:41,230
they're supposed to they don't actually

478
00:21:41,230 --> 00:21:44,380
and another item on this is if at all

479
00:21:44,380 --> 00:21:47,290
possible provide secure templates for

480
00:21:47,290 --> 00:21:49,929
them if you can ever provide templates

481
00:21:49,929 --> 00:21:51,820
for them to use that our self-service

482
00:21:51,820 --> 00:21:54,700
please please please please do because

483
00:21:54,700 --> 00:21:56,590
that hopes they have a lot of time and

484
00:21:56,590 --> 00:22:00,400
it also can create good relations when

485
00:22:00,400 --> 00:22:03,160
they know they can count on you ok so

486
00:22:03,160 --> 00:22:06,760
this is the next photo slide I would

487
00:22:06,760 --> 00:22:08,919
like to tell you during the slide that a

488
00:22:08,919 --> 00:22:11,500
secure coding library is a great thing

489
00:22:11,500 --> 00:22:13,570
but you need to work with the software

490
00:22:13,570 --> 00:22:15,640
developers to create it do not just go

491
00:22:15,640 --> 00:22:17,559
into their code repo and might start

492
00:22:17,559 --> 00:22:20,290
messing around the code repository is

493
00:22:20,290 --> 00:22:22,000
like a woman's curse you do not just put

494
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:22,900
your hands in it

495
00:22:22,900 --> 00:22:25,840
we are security people it belongs to

496
00:22:25,840 --> 00:22:28,720
them and so you need to respect that or

497
00:22:28,720 --> 00:22:34,000
it won't go well ok next slide so what

498
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:36,669
else does this mean for security another

499
00:22:36,669 --> 00:22:38,620
so I think that I've seen a lot of

500
00:22:38,620 --> 00:22:40,210
people talk about and that I've done and

501
00:22:40,210 --> 00:22:42,880
it's I mean I'm a giant tech nerd so I

502
00:22:42,880 --> 00:22:44,980
just find it fun you could create more

503
00:22:44,980 --> 00:22:46,840
than one pipeline for the same patch so

504
00:22:46,840 --> 00:22:48,940
you can have the release pipeline and

505
00:22:48,940 --> 00:22:50,440
that's the pipeline that goes to prod

506
00:22:50,440 --> 00:22:53,080
and you can just have your very serious

507
00:22:53,080 --> 00:22:54,970
security tests in there that you can

508
00:22:54,970 --> 00:22:57,130
have an asynchronous or parallel

509
00:22:57,130 --> 00:23:00,429
security pipeline that does all the slow

510
00:23:00,429 --> 00:23:02,650
tests that you want so oh they're gonna

511
00:23:02,650 --> 00:23:05,140
run a static application security

512
00:23:05,140 --> 00:23:08,049
testing sassed exercise on the entire

513
00:23:08,049 --> 00:23:09,549
code base and I know it's going to take

514
00:23:09,549 --> 00:23:12,190
18 hours so you can just kick that off

515
00:23:12,190 --> 00:23:14,260
on Friday to come see the results on

516
00:23:14,260 --> 00:23:20,770
Monday and not annoy anyone so when you

517
00:23:20,770 --> 00:23:22,270
put that in the release pipeline

518
00:23:22,270 --> 00:23:24,820
you're ruining everyone else's day on

519
00:23:24,820 --> 00:23:26,559
that team but if you have your own

520
00:23:26,559 --> 00:23:27,910
asynchronous pipeline you're not

521
00:23:27,910 --> 00:23:29,380
bothering anyone and you're still

522
00:23:29,380 --> 00:23:30,730
getting cool results and you're still

523
00:23:30,730 --> 00:23:32,530
using automation you can chain all your

524
00:23:32,530 --> 00:23:34,510
security tools together and then go dig

525
00:23:34,510 --> 00:23:36,700
around and the results on Monday it's

526
00:23:36,700 --> 00:23:40,059
really really nice another thing for

527
00:23:40,059 --> 00:23:43,120
security is if you can buy licenses for

528
00:23:43,120 --> 00:23:45,910
security tools if the developers really

529
00:23:45,910 --> 00:23:48,340
want you know oh asks app which is free

530
00:23:48,340 --> 00:23:49,710
or if they want

531
00:23:49,710 --> 00:23:51,720
we don't know burps we or they want

532
00:23:51,720 --> 00:23:53,880
Fiddler's or they whatever it is that

533
00:23:53,880 --> 00:23:55,919
they want if it's a thing that they want

534
00:23:55,919 --> 00:23:58,320
and you can afford it pay them a license

535
00:23:58,320 --> 00:24:01,230
because they're doing some of your work

536
00:24:01,230 --> 00:24:04,169
for you and that's really great I love

537
00:24:04,169 --> 00:24:07,620
it when other people do my work trust me

538
00:24:07,620 --> 00:24:12,149
yeah so just this repeats what I was

539
00:24:12,149 --> 00:24:14,039
just saying so we'll just continue on so

540
00:24:14,039 --> 00:24:16,620
there's more things for security this

541
00:24:16,620 --> 00:24:18,750
does not mean doing 100 percent of the

542
00:24:18,750 --> 00:24:20,789
security work yourself that is

543
00:24:20,789 --> 00:24:23,669
impossible you can't do that so this

544
00:24:23,669 --> 00:24:26,700
means teaching dev and ops and enable

545
00:24:26,700 --> 00:24:28,919
then enabling them to do some of the

546
00:24:28,919 --> 00:24:30,029
work

547
00:24:30,029 --> 00:24:32,039
it also means potentially writing your

548
00:24:32,039 --> 00:24:35,309
own cool libraries or tools if you feel

549
00:24:35,309 --> 00:24:37,020
that you have a really specific need and

550
00:24:37,020 --> 00:24:38,549
there's nothing on the market that can

551
00:24:38,549 --> 00:24:39,539
do that for you

552
00:24:39,539 --> 00:24:43,110
be creative and do anything you can to

553
00:24:43,110 --> 00:24:46,679
make sure that they can get their jobs

554
00:24:46,679 --> 00:24:49,169
done securely like their I've seen so

555
00:24:49,169 --> 00:24:53,010
many creative ideas on this so here is

556
00:24:53,010 --> 00:24:55,470
the next photo spy and I realize I'm

557
00:24:55,470 --> 00:24:56,850
gonna have to go faster because I only

558
00:24:56,850 --> 00:24:59,159
have 13 minutes left and I am like

559
00:24:59,159 --> 00:25:02,549
halfway through okay so faster feedback

560
00:25:02,549 --> 00:25:07,710
I pull this pushing left or shifting

561
00:25:07,710 --> 00:25:09,539
left if you are invited

562
00:25:09,539 --> 00:25:12,419
so starting security earlier in the

563
00:25:12,419 --> 00:25:14,429
system development lifecycle let's get

564
00:25:14,429 --> 00:25:17,490
people feedback right away so how do we

565
00:25:17,490 --> 00:25:20,940
do that so developers and ops want

566
00:25:20,940 --> 00:25:22,830
feedback right away great let's give it

567
00:25:22,830 --> 00:25:27,539
to them so first of all this is a slide

568
00:25:27,539 --> 00:25:31,799
that the Ponemon Institute created this

569
00:25:31,799 --> 00:25:35,460
is the cost of finding a bug a security

570
00:25:35,460 --> 00:25:37,529
bug or any kind of bug later in the

571
00:25:37,529 --> 00:25:39,630
system development lifecycle what you

572
00:25:39,630 --> 00:25:41,970
don't see here this is in production if

573
00:25:41,970 --> 00:25:46,200
you find it if we would have to I don't

574
00:25:46,200 --> 00:25:48,059
even know how much money it would be if

575
00:25:48,059 --> 00:25:49,740
there's a breach there's a data breach

576
00:25:49,740 --> 00:25:51,899
if there's a security incident it is it

577
00:25:51,899 --> 00:25:54,090
just like the chart of money just goes

578
00:25:54,090 --> 00:25:59,340
like this um it is way way way more

579
00:25:59,340 --> 00:26:01,700
expensive to find a bug later and

580
00:26:01,700 --> 00:26:04,250
for security bugs or security flaws so

581
00:26:04,250 --> 00:26:06,289
like a design issue a business logic

582
00:26:06,289 --> 00:26:08,960
issue when they show this to management

583
00:26:08,960 --> 00:26:10,610
it helps me get them on board for

584
00:26:10,610 --> 00:26:12,980
allowing me to start security earlier so

585
00:26:12,980 --> 00:26:14,720
feel free to discreet about this because

586
00:26:14,720 --> 00:26:16,720
this is great

587
00:26:16,720 --> 00:26:19,309
so what does this mean for Devon ops it

588
00:26:19,309 --> 00:26:21,830
means providing feedback to the security

589
00:26:21,830 --> 00:26:23,750
team about things that you are concerned

590
00:26:23,750 --> 00:26:26,750
about please tell us we don't know it

591
00:26:26,750 --> 00:26:28,580
might seem very obvious to you but if

592
00:26:28,580 --> 00:26:29,990
we're doing it it's probably because

593
00:26:29,990 --> 00:26:31,610
it's not obvious to us we're not like

594
00:26:31,610 --> 00:26:32,600
you'll be great

595
00:26:32,600 --> 00:26:34,909
let's annoy the dev team whoa and

596
00:26:34,909 --> 00:26:37,039
agitate them and cause them problems

597
00:26:37,039 --> 00:26:39,169
that is not a conversation that's

598
00:26:39,169 --> 00:26:42,830
happening on any security remember we

599
00:26:42,830 --> 00:26:44,659
probably just are oblivious because it's

600
00:26:44,659 --> 00:26:48,710
not part of our work our daily work so

601
00:26:48,710 --> 00:26:50,240
then the security team when you hear

602
00:26:50,240 --> 00:26:52,340
this we need to listen and then we need

603
00:26:52,340 --> 00:26:55,909
to take action that is important so we

604
00:26:55,909 --> 00:26:57,380
need to listen thank them for their

605
00:26:57,380 --> 00:27:00,139
feedback try not to get defensive when

606
00:27:00,139 --> 00:27:02,929
they call our baby ugly and then we need

607
00:27:02,929 --> 00:27:06,230
to take action and improve we also need

608
00:27:06,230 --> 00:27:10,549
the Devon ops team to participate if we

609
00:27:10,549 --> 00:27:12,230
have security activities like if we have

610
00:27:12,230 --> 00:27:14,779
a threat modeling exercise if none of

611
00:27:14,779 --> 00:27:17,000
you show up that means we're missing out

612
00:27:17,000 --> 00:27:20,149
on your opinions and your ideas and that

613
00:27:20,149 --> 00:27:22,909
sucks because you're awesome that's why

614
00:27:22,909 --> 00:27:27,080
you work where we work right and another

615
00:27:27,080 --> 00:27:31,309
thing is if a major security test fails

616
00:27:31,309 --> 00:27:34,370
it needs to break the build just like a

617
00:27:34,370 --> 00:27:39,200
quality test and this is kind of a it's

618
00:27:39,200 --> 00:27:42,950
like a change in decision-making process

619
00:27:42,950 --> 00:27:45,049
like a thought process that we need the

620
00:27:45,049 --> 00:27:47,809
Devon ops team to take on that security

621
00:27:47,809 --> 00:27:50,269
is a part of quality and if a big

622
00:27:50,269 --> 00:27:52,669
security test fails that that means your

623
00:27:52,669 --> 00:27:54,970
build is not quality and it can't pass

624
00:27:54,970 --> 00:27:58,220
ok so next what does doesn't mean for

625
00:27:58,220 --> 00:28:00,440
security so besides the fact that it

626
00:28:00,440 --> 00:28:03,799
means pushing left and I love that just

627
00:28:03,799 --> 00:28:05,330
to be clear

628
00:28:05,330 --> 00:28:08,179
it also means we need to provide

629
00:28:08,179 --> 00:28:11,299
feedback earlier and wave win more often

630
00:28:11,299 --> 00:28:14,090
we cannot just hire a penetration tester

631
00:28:14,090 --> 00:28:14,520
to come

632
00:28:14,520 --> 00:28:17,880
in two weeks before we go live and then

633
00:28:17,880 --> 00:28:20,280
tell them you know there's like 25

634
00:28:20,280 --> 00:28:22,290
security problems we need to be looking

635
00:28:22,290 --> 00:28:23,580
at those requirements at the very

636
00:28:23,580 --> 00:28:24,990
beginning we need to review the design

637
00:28:24,990 --> 00:28:27,210
with them trap model with them like we

638
00:28:27,210 --> 00:28:29,460
need to start at the beginning it's just

639
00:28:29,460 --> 00:28:32,400
like they do we want to automate as much

640
00:28:32,400 --> 00:28:34,770
of this as we can so that they don't

641
00:28:34,770 --> 00:28:37,950
have to weed on us we want to teach them

642
00:28:37,950 --> 00:28:39,929
to understand what the results of our

643
00:28:39,929 --> 00:28:41,730
security tools are telling them whenever

644
00:28:41,730 --> 00:28:43,860
possible so they don't have to wait on

645
00:28:43,860 --> 00:28:48,690
us and we need to be very careful not to

646
00:28:48,690 --> 00:28:50,790
get false positives because that breaks

647
00:28:50,790 --> 00:28:54,030
trust it wastes their time and it causes

648
00:28:54,030 --> 00:28:56,370
doubt and every other result we give

649
00:28:56,370 --> 00:28:58,230
them so it's really really important

650
00:28:58,230 --> 00:29:02,190
that we work hard not to give them false

651
00:29:02,190 --> 00:29:03,860
positives

652
00:29:03,860 --> 00:29:07,820
another thing is know another thing is

653
00:29:07,820 --> 00:29:10,710
we really really need to listen to their

654
00:29:10,710 --> 00:29:12,390
feedback I know I said that in another

655
00:29:12,390 --> 00:29:14,760
slide that I made a whole slide just to

656
00:29:14,760 --> 00:29:16,290
impress upon you how important that is

657
00:29:16,290 --> 00:29:18,090
if they give us feedback and we ignore

658
00:29:18,090 --> 00:29:23,850
it that is the start of the act okay so

659
00:29:23,850 --> 00:29:26,450
here is a whole bunch of things

660
00:29:26,450 --> 00:29:29,190
Netflix created a tool called repo kid

661
00:29:29,190 --> 00:29:31,290
and it's open source and it helps you

662
00:29:31,290 --> 00:29:33,150
automate least privilege and I think

663
00:29:33,150 --> 00:29:35,880
that's wicked cool and there's startups

664
00:29:35,880 --> 00:29:39,150
coming out with like even more advanced

665
00:29:39,150 --> 00:29:41,700
things than repo kid but it is really

666
00:29:41,700 --> 00:29:43,440
really cool and they've got that idea

667
00:29:43,440 --> 00:29:46,290
from listening to their dev and ops

668
00:29:46,290 --> 00:29:48,600
teams and then changing their actions

669
00:29:48,600 --> 00:29:51,540
based on that feedback and that is why

670
00:29:51,540 --> 00:29:54,630
it's extra cool okay so what does this

671
00:29:54,630 --> 00:29:59,640
mean for security it means so unit tests

672
00:29:59,640 --> 00:30:01,800
are positive tests a test does my code

673
00:30:01,800 --> 00:30:03,630
do what it's supposed to do negative

674
00:30:03,630 --> 00:30:08,520
unit tests tests as Mike does my app

675
00:30:08,520 --> 00:30:11,340
fail gracefully if bad things happen to

676
00:30:11,340 --> 00:30:15,120
it and if we can make negative unit

677
00:30:15,120 --> 00:30:16,590
tests if we can work for software

678
00:30:16,590 --> 00:30:18,360
developers to create these we can have

679
00:30:18,360 --> 00:30:21,120
regressive security testing and that is

680
00:30:21,120 --> 00:30:23,520
magical like if you've had a pen test

681
00:30:23,520 --> 00:30:26,340
then put those results into unit tests

682
00:30:26,340 --> 00:30:27,900
like there's so many cool things that

683
00:30:27,900 --> 00:30:28,260
you

684
00:30:28,260 --> 00:30:30,630
do with unit tests but it only works if

685
00:30:30,630 --> 00:30:35,690
you talk to your dev and ops team also

686
00:30:35,690 --> 00:30:38,520
invite Devon ops to participate in

687
00:30:38,520 --> 00:30:40,200
security activities you might be

688
00:30:40,200 --> 00:30:41,940
surprised you might find a whole bunch

689
00:30:41,940 --> 00:30:44,430
of security champions that are just

690
00:30:44,430 --> 00:30:46,440
waiting to happen so if there's an

691
00:30:46,440 --> 00:30:48,230
incident if you can bring someone along

692
00:30:48,230 --> 00:30:50,910
if you're a loud threat modeling

693
00:30:50,910 --> 00:30:55,290
security Sprint's etc like let them know

694
00:30:55,290 --> 00:30:57,540
they're welcome and wanted and you might

695
00:30:57,540 --> 00:31:00,570
be surprised by who shows up and the

696
00:31:00,570 --> 00:31:02,610
relationships that you can form and how

697
00:31:02,610 --> 00:31:05,490
good how much that can help you with the

698
00:31:05,490 --> 00:31:07,550
rest of the project

699
00:31:07,550 --> 00:31:11,490
another thing is use tools like

700
00:31:11,490 --> 00:31:13,530
vulnerable team management tools to

701
00:31:13,530 --> 00:31:15,720
gather metrics and then base your

702
00:31:15,720 --> 00:31:18,690
activities on metrics once I started

703
00:31:18,690 --> 00:31:20,880
getting data about things oh my gosh I

704
00:31:20,880 --> 00:31:23,370
put this down and start doing this put

705
00:31:23,370 --> 00:31:25,160
all our money here put our time there

706
00:31:25,160 --> 00:31:28,800
because you if you're gonna run an

707
00:31:28,800 --> 00:31:30,480
experiment you have to measure to know

708
00:31:30,480 --> 00:31:32,070
that you've done a good job and if

709
00:31:32,070 --> 00:31:35,010
you're not taking the data out of all of

710
00:31:35,010 --> 00:31:36,810
your tools and then analyzing it you are

711
00:31:36,810 --> 00:31:39,030
missing out on a huge opportunity I know

712
00:31:39,030 --> 00:31:42,000
I'm a data nerd so I'm like I seem

713
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:44,570
really biased by - because it's awesome

714
00:31:44,570 --> 00:31:48,510
I also think it's it's important that if

715
00:31:48,510 --> 00:31:50,820
you get a contest then that you take

716
00:31:50,820 --> 00:31:52,590
those results and then search every

717
00:31:52,590 --> 00:31:54,630
single app in your wheelhouse

718
00:31:54,630 --> 00:31:56,760
for those same problems because quite

719
00:31:56,760 --> 00:31:59,040
frankly your developers developed all

720
00:31:59,040 --> 00:32:00,690
your apps and they probably made that

721
00:32:00,690 --> 00:32:02,790
same mistake elsewhere and so you can

722
00:32:02,790 --> 00:32:05,070
get more value from that one external

723
00:32:05,070 --> 00:32:09,140
security tester then they might realize

724
00:32:09,140 --> 00:32:13,260
but basically be creative that's what I

725
00:32:13,260 --> 00:32:14,220
would like I would like you to be

726
00:32:14,220 --> 00:32:19,350
creative yes okay so here is photo

727
00:32:19,350 --> 00:32:22,530
number slide number five these slides

728
00:32:22,530 --> 00:32:25,140
are on the internet so if you missed a

729
00:32:25,140 --> 00:32:26,700
chance to take a picture of one of them

730
00:32:26,700 --> 00:32:27,990
and I'm pretty sure this is being

731
00:32:27,990 --> 00:32:31,320
recorded so you will be able to review

732
00:32:31,320 --> 00:32:35,220
it later ok next so continuous learning

733
00:32:35,220 --> 00:32:38,090
full circle I don't have a cute ASCII

734
00:32:38,090 --> 00:32:40,140
image for this

735
00:32:40,140 --> 00:32:42,150
right this is why I wasn't hired by

736
00:32:42,150 --> 00:32:45,750
Pixar okay so what does this mean for

737
00:32:45,750 --> 00:32:46,740
Devon ops

738
00:32:46,740 --> 00:32:49,020
if we offer you security training please

739
00:32:49,020 --> 00:32:51,090
come we need you

740
00:32:51,090 --> 00:32:53,730
you can train yourselves there's so many

741
00:32:53,730 --> 00:32:55,320
free resources I'm going to share a few

742
00:32:55,320 --> 00:32:59,160
at the end share information widely when

743
00:32:59,160 --> 00:33:02,070
you find a security bug tell everyone

744
00:33:02,070 --> 00:33:05,970
else about it like tell everyone how you

745
00:33:05,970 --> 00:33:08,100
fixed it or how this cool thing happened

746
00:33:08,100 --> 00:33:11,549
share information I know that sometimes

747
00:33:11,549 --> 00:33:14,070
software developers can be shy send an

748
00:33:14,070 --> 00:33:16,980
email it's less scary but share share

749
00:33:16,980 --> 00:33:20,160
the information if we have a security

750
00:33:20,160 --> 00:33:22,530
simulation or a security exercise and by

751
00:33:22,530 --> 00:33:24,690
that I mean a fake security incident

752
00:33:24,690 --> 00:33:27,030
where we practice and refine our

753
00:33:27,030 --> 00:33:30,030
processes participate if you can because

754
00:33:30,030 --> 00:33:34,770
it's super fun it's so fun but for

755
00:33:34,770 --> 00:33:38,370
security it means we need to offer

756
00:33:38,370 --> 00:33:41,340
security training and I don't mean don't

757
00:33:41,340 --> 00:33:42,270
click this link

758
00:33:42,270 --> 00:33:44,730
I mean secure code training I mean

759
00:33:44,730 --> 00:33:47,309
training on how to follow our policies I

760
00:33:47,309 --> 00:33:50,850
mean secure design training we need to

761
00:33:50,850 --> 00:33:52,799
show that how the threat model we need

762
00:33:52,799 --> 00:33:54,450
to teach some of these skills if we

763
00:33:54,450 --> 00:33:56,669
expect them to have these skills you

764
00:33:56,669 --> 00:33:59,010
can't expect the average software

765
00:33:59,010 --> 00:34:00,660
developer to understand how to create

766
00:34:00,660 --> 00:34:03,450
perfectly secure code and we also should

767
00:34:03,450 --> 00:34:05,730
base this training off of the metrics we

768
00:34:05,730 --> 00:34:07,470
find so for instance if you are seeing

769
00:34:07,470 --> 00:34:09,300
cross-site scripting everywhere across

770
00:34:09,300 --> 00:34:11,040
your organization that should be the

771
00:34:11,040 --> 00:34:14,940
first lesson that you teach another

772
00:34:14,940 --> 00:34:17,310
thing it means for security is if you

773
00:34:17,310 --> 00:34:19,350
can if you have the resources to run a

774
00:34:19,350 --> 00:34:21,869
security simulation you would be

775
00:34:21,869 --> 00:34:24,330
surprised all the problems that you will

776
00:34:24,330 --> 00:34:26,190
find out and that you can fix before

777
00:34:26,190 --> 00:34:28,440
real incidents happen you'll also

778
00:34:28,440 --> 00:34:30,359
probably figure out that your other

779
00:34:30,359 --> 00:34:32,159
teams don't know what you need from them

780
00:34:32,159 --> 00:34:33,750
and then you will realize there's

781
00:34:33,750 --> 00:34:37,050
training that is missing it is our job

782
00:34:37,050 --> 00:34:42,030
to teach dev and ops how to do their job

783
00:34:42,030 --> 00:34:44,159
securely it is our job to enable them

784
00:34:44,159 --> 00:34:45,510
with the tools and the knowledge they

785
00:34:45,510 --> 00:34:48,659
need that's what I want to get across so

786
00:34:48,659 --> 00:34:49,300
much

787
00:34:49,300 --> 00:34:52,239
in this slide so this is photo slide

788
00:34:52,239 --> 00:34:55,630
number six we are lightning downs I have

789
00:34:55,630 --> 00:34:58,840
three minutes left so what else does

790
00:34:58,840 --> 00:35:00,880
this mean for security it means we must

791
00:35:00,880 --> 00:35:03,370
perform blameless post mortems when we

792
00:35:03,370 --> 00:35:05,710
have an incident pointing fingers will

793
00:35:05,710 --> 00:35:08,620
not get us what we want and it means we

794
00:35:08,620 --> 00:35:10,300
should talk about security incidents

795
00:35:10,300 --> 00:35:13,000
after they are over enclosed so that

796
00:35:13,000 --> 00:35:14,740
developers know what the cost is and

797
00:35:14,740 --> 00:35:17,260
they understand the risk if we keep it

798
00:35:17,260 --> 00:35:19,870
all a secret they won't understand we

799
00:35:19,870 --> 00:35:21,850
need them on our side so we need to talk

800
00:35:21,850 --> 00:35:26,670
to dev and ops like the adults they are

801
00:35:26,770 --> 00:35:30,340
it also means teaching developers and

802
00:35:30,340 --> 00:35:32,770
ops what the output from the security

803
00:35:32,770 --> 00:35:35,410
tools means it means putting all the

804
00:35:35,410 --> 00:35:37,540
stuff into a knowledge base or buying

805
00:35:37,540 --> 00:35:40,000
access to a knowledge base so that we

806
00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:41,530
don't have to repeat the same lessons

807
00:35:41,530 --> 00:35:43,120
over and over again and they can do so

808
00:35:43,120 --> 00:35:45,220
service it means creating

809
00:35:45,220 --> 00:35:47,710
lunch-and-learn opportunities like

810
00:35:47,710 --> 00:35:50,440
writing emails or wait papers allowing

811
00:35:50,440 --> 00:35:52,510
job shadowing like doing whatever you

812
00:35:52,510 --> 00:35:54,490
can to make sure they know everything

813
00:35:54,490 --> 00:35:57,340
they need to know to create really

814
00:35:57,340 --> 00:36:03,190
secure software and systems ok so now

815
00:36:03,190 --> 00:36:05,860
I'm going to talk about culture change

816
00:36:05,860 --> 00:36:09,100
in the few minutes that are left so

817
00:36:09,100 --> 00:36:12,040
security needs to become a part of dev

818
00:36:12,040 --> 00:36:15,580
ops we need to change culture and this

819
00:36:15,580 --> 00:36:17,470
means we need to reinforce culture

820
00:36:17,470 --> 00:36:20,530
change by celebrating wins when a team

821
00:36:20,530 --> 00:36:23,770
does a good job get them fruit or

822
00:36:23,770 --> 00:36:26,110
doughnuts or coffee or whatever it is

823
00:36:26,110 --> 00:36:28,300
that is the thing in your office that

824
00:36:28,300 --> 00:36:31,060
people do reward good behavior and

825
00:36:31,060 --> 00:36:34,000
especially recognize good behavior tell

826
00:36:34,000 --> 00:36:36,040
their boss if there is a software

827
00:36:36,040 --> 00:36:37,960
developer or mots person that goes above

828
00:36:37,960 --> 00:36:40,180
and beyond send an email to their boss

829
00:36:40,180 --> 00:36:45,400
to say it that means so much try to work

830
00:36:45,400 --> 00:36:47,650
more closely actually spend time with

831
00:36:47,650 --> 00:36:49,840
them it's kind of our social events they

832
00:36:49,840 --> 00:36:53,470
are humans you might like them having

833
00:36:53,470 --> 00:36:55,660
relationships is all about what acts

834
00:36:55,660 --> 00:36:56,140
like is

835
00:36:56,140 --> 00:37:00,280
about we can't blame people like I said

836
00:37:00,280 --> 00:37:02,710
when we do post mortems it's not Alice's

837
00:37:02,710 --> 00:37:04,300
fault or Bob's fault

838
00:37:04,300 --> 00:37:07,120
it's what safeguard is missing what

839
00:37:07,120 --> 00:37:09,460
process is broken what policy doesn't

840
00:37:09,460 --> 00:37:12,790
exist and needs to I cannot tell you how

841
00:37:12,790 --> 00:37:14,590
much this matter it's because I have

842
00:37:14,590 --> 00:37:17,170
made this mistake and had to eat a lot

843
00:37:17,170 --> 00:37:22,630
of dirt and humble pie also if you can

844
00:37:22,630 --> 00:37:24,610
create a security champions I took that

845
00:37:24,610 --> 00:37:26,890
I chose this photo because I was just

846
00:37:26,890 --> 00:37:30,370
like she's a badass like she I want her

847
00:37:30,370 --> 00:37:33,700

848
00:37:33,700 --> 00:37:35,290
the people that go out and help you

849
00:37:35,290 --> 00:37:36,610
fight the good fight

850
00:37:36,610 --> 00:37:38,470

851
00:37:38,470 --> 00:37:40,780

852
00:37:40,780 --> 00:37:42,430
