1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:01,979
we're all set to get our first speaker

2
00:00:01,979 --> 00:00:05,009
up here and so our first speaker is the

3
00:00:05,009 --> 00:00:09,059
CEO of hisin technologies and practical

4
00:00:09,059 --> 00:00:11,880
dev sec ops he's got a diverse

5
00:00:11,880 --> 00:00:14,730
background in R&D and consulting he's

6
00:00:14,730 --> 00:00:17,660
also the founder of null Singapore a

7
00:00:17,660 --> 00:00:21,600
massive security community in Singapore

8
00:00:21,600 --> 00:00:24,359
and we are super fortunate to have him

9
00:00:24,359 --> 00:00:26,939
here with us today so without further

10
00:00:26,939 --> 00:00:31,520
ado I want to welcome muhammad imran

11
00:00:31,520 --> 00:00:35,489
take it away mohammed thank you thank

12
00:00:35,489 --> 00:00:37,380

please confirm if you're able to see my

15
00:00:41,760 --> 00:00:45,899
screen yep we are all set you are good

16
00:00:45,899 --> 00:00:47,059
to go

17
00:00:47,059 --> 00:00:52,020
hold on okay great then I guess you're

18
00:00:52,020 --> 00:00:54,050
able to see my screen thanks a lot

19
00:00:54,050 --> 00:00:57,149
welcome everyone as a least I just

20
00:00:57,149 --> 00:00:58,320
mentioned a mimiron

21
00:00:58,320 --> 00:01:00,480
today we are going to talk about bodies

22
00:01:00,480 --> 00:01:02,489
continuous auditing or you can also call

23
00:01:02,489 --> 00:01:05,519
it as what is compliance as code and I

24
00:01:05,519 --> 00:01:08,070
believe this is the final frontier in

25
00:01:08,070 --> 00:01:10,439
digital transformation of death psych

26
00:01:10,439 --> 00:01:15,150
ops let's see how compliance as code can

27
00:01:15,150 --> 00:01:18,090
help you achieve a massive amount of

28
00:01:18,090 --> 00:01:21,240
automation and doing so achieve reduce

29
00:01:21,240 --> 00:01:22,799
the risk of your organization very

30
00:01:22,799 --> 00:01:24,869
drastically so today we are going to

31
00:01:24,869 --> 00:01:28,140
talk about a bit of introduction of what

32
00:01:28,140 --> 00:01:29,700
is that psych ops then we'll go into

33
00:01:29,700 --> 00:01:32,700
what is compliance so that we all are on

34
00:01:32,700 --> 00:01:35,250
the same page I finally will see how we

35
00:01:35,250 --> 00:01:37,829
can achieve compliance using code and

36
00:01:37,829 --> 00:01:40,860
don't let that word code scan you even

37
00:01:40,860 --> 00:01:42,119
though you are from a compliance

38
00:01:42,119 --> 00:01:44,399
background right it's very easy the

39
00:01:44,399 --> 00:01:46,200
current technology will allow you to

40
00:01:46,200 --> 00:01:49,320
automate with just simple two liners we

41
00:01:49,320 --> 00:01:51,840
look into that and finally we will end

42
00:01:51,840 --> 00:01:54,090
the session with a demo where I will

43
00:01:54,090 --> 00:01:57,180
show you how we can embed compliance and

44
00:01:57,180 --> 00:01:59,640
compliance tests as part of CI CD

45
00:01:59,640 --> 00:02:02,729
pipeline and it will not take like ages

46
00:02:02,729 --> 00:02:04,770
to finish but rather it will just take a

47
00:02:04,770 --> 00:02:06,570
couple of minutes to achieve compliance

48
00:02:06,570 --> 00:02:08,729
I scored and you'll see that I will end

49
00:02:08,729 --> 00:02:10,979
the presentation with what else we can

50
00:02:10,979 --> 00:02:13,980
do in organization probably right after

51
00:02:13,980 --> 00:02:18,060
presentation right so at least have

52
00:02:18,060 --> 00:02:21,150
already introduced me so I'll just skip

53
00:02:21,150 --> 00:02:23,970
this part and in order to be on the same

54
00:02:23,970 --> 00:02:26,250
page let's talk a little bit about what

55
00:02:26,250 --> 00:02:28,830
is deaf suck-ups and I all realized that

56
00:02:28,830 --> 00:02:31,170
there is no agreed upon definition on

57
00:02:31,170 --> 00:02:34,230
what is that sick house so this is just

58
00:02:34,230 --> 00:02:37,560
a my attempts to see to bring all the

59
00:02:37,560 --> 00:02:39,540
files on a same page so I believe

60
00:02:39,540 --> 00:02:42,959
history teaches a lot in terms of what's

61
00:02:42,959 --> 00:02:44,459
going to happen in the future as well

62
00:02:44,459 --> 00:02:47,280
right so it was very important to look

63
00:02:47,280 --> 00:02:50,459
back why we started off with DevOps at

64
00:02:50,459 --> 00:02:52,319
that sec ups so if you notice on the

65
00:02:52,319 --> 00:02:54,209
screen you'll see that there was a huge

66
00:02:54,209 --> 00:02:56,010
disconnect between what a business

67
00:02:56,010 --> 00:02:58,230
wanted versus web developers used to

68
00:02:58,230 --> 00:02:59,790
provide to the business as a solution

69
00:02:59,790 --> 00:03:02,090
and in order to solve this problem

70
00:03:02,090 --> 00:03:04,680
business came up with novel ways of

71
00:03:04,680 --> 00:03:06,900
solving these problems among them one

72
00:03:06,900 --> 00:03:07,950
such metrology

73
00:03:07,950 --> 00:03:11,549
one such method is your agile right

74
00:03:11,549 --> 00:03:14,370
instead of waiting for like six months

75
00:03:14,370 --> 00:03:16,920
around a year or two years to provide

76
00:03:16,920 --> 00:03:19,650
feedback to the customers we will now

77
00:03:19,650 --> 00:03:21,959
instead of waiting for in a year we will

78
00:03:21,959 --> 00:03:23,639
provide feedback to the customer nor a

79
00:03:23,639 --> 00:03:25,829
regular basis probably once a week twice

80
00:03:25,829 --> 00:03:30,359
a week or what whatever right now they

81
00:03:30,359 --> 00:03:32,220
solve this disconnect between business

82
00:03:32,220 --> 00:03:35,880
and development teams using agile now

83
00:03:35,880 --> 00:03:39,209
you see when developers trying to

84
00:03:39,209 --> 00:03:41,609
implement tried implementing agile they

85
00:03:41,609 --> 00:03:43,470
were able to push code to production a

86
00:03:43,470 --> 00:03:44,790
no-brainer you look at their base is

87
00:03:44,790 --> 00:03:46,500
probably every nine seconds there are

88
00:03:46,500 --> 00:03:48,540
some organizations which push code to

89
00:03:48,540 --> 00:03:51,209
production every nine seconds right now

90
00:03:51,209 --> 00:03:54,889
since developer teams were able to push

91
00:03:54,889 --> 00:03:57,510
code to production on a such a rapid

92
00:03:57,510 --> 00:03:59,760
phase operations worth the bottleneck

93
00:03:59,760 --> 00:04:02,430
for them which means they were not able

94
00:04:02,430 --> 00:04:04,290
to cope up with the amount of code the

95
00:04:04,290 --> 00:04:06,450
developers were creating and in order to

96
00:04:06,450 --> 00:04:08,370
solve this developers and operations

97
00:04:08,370 --> 00:04:11,129
teams tried to see what can we do

98
00:04:11,129 --> 00:04:13,379
improve this bottom line what can we

99
00:04:13,379 --> 00:04:15,989
improve in the process what can we do to

100
00:04:15,989 --> 00:04:18,329
improve the technology so that as soon

101
00:04:18,329 --> 00:04:19,649
as a developer pushes code the

102
00:04:19,649 --> 00:04:23,190
production it can go to as soon as they

103
00:04:23,190 --> 00:04:27,110
push go to version control system it can

104
00:04:27,110 --> 00:04:29,539
go to production very seamlessly in a

105
00:04:29,539 --> 00:04:32,120
less amount of time and they solve this

106
00:04:32,120 --> 00:04:34,669
disconnect the problem are silos with

107
00:04:34,669 --> 00:04:36,949
the help of a metrology and a new way of

108
00:04:36,949 --> 00:04:39,939
doing software development called DevOps

109
00:04:39,939 --> 00:04:44,150
right and by definition DevOps had

110
00:04:44,150 --> 00:04:47,599
security as part of the initiative but

111
00:04:47,599 --> 00:04:49,610
then just like everything else security

112
00:04:49,610 --> 00:04:52,009
was left behind well we'll explore why

113
00:04:52,009 --> 00:04:53,750
what are the some of the reasons

114
00:04:53,750 --> 00:04:56,030
biosecurity was left behind but then

115
00:04:56,030 --> 00:04:58,449
eventually now people are talking about

116
00:04:58,449 --> 00:05:01,759
we need to talk about security as part

117
00:05:01,759 --> 00:05:04,279
of DevOps right and I consider that as a

118
00:05:04,279 --> 00:05:06,889
final frontier of the Deaf cigars our

119
00:05:06,889 --> 00:05:10,330
DevOps transformation right and then

120
00:05:10,330 --> 00:05:13,340
security did thanks to the awesome work

121
00:05:13,340 --> 00:05:15,710
of communities like my adepts I cards

122
00:05:15,710 --> 00:05:18,740
conferences like Def second across the

123
00:05:18,740 --> 00:05:20,930
world lot of people are contributing

124
00:05:20,930 --> 00:05:24,080
this to this education effort thanks to

125
00:05:24,080 --> 00:05:26,240
that a lot of people are now embedding

126
00:05:26,240 --> 00:05:28,370
security as part of CI CV pipelines

127
00:05:28,370 --> 00:05:31,789
however I see I still see the compliance

128
00:05:31,789 --> 00:05:33,319
team strength struggling to embed

129
00:05:33,319 --> 00:05:35,930
security as part of CI CD pipeline or

130
00:05:35,930 --> 00:05:38,029
DevOps at dev setups right so this

131
00:05:38,029 --> 00:05:40,520
presentation I'll show you how we can

132
00:05:40,520 --> 00:05:42,830
automate compliance with minimal amount

133
00:05:42,830 --> 00:05:46,279
of efforts right let's move on and see

134
00:05:46,279 --> 00:05:49,520
what else we can do to improve this

135
00:05:49,520 --> 00:05:52,550
practice the compliance that's good all

136
00:05:52,550 --> 00:05:55,400
right as I mentioned before when I say

137
00:05:55,400 --> 00:05:57,279
it def psych ops it's it's about

138
00:05:57,279 --> 00:05:59,810
application security and DevOps

139
00:05:59,810 --> 00:06:01,939
environment or security in DevOps

140
00:06:01,939 --> 00:06:04,129
environment and as you can see on your

141
00:06:04,129 --> 00:06:07,520
screen as well I started the slide with

142
00:06:07,520 --> 00:06:09,259
that psych ops but then the first

143
00:06:09,259 --> 00:06:11,479
sentence talks about only about them up

144
00:06:11,479 --> 00:06:13,939
so I personally there is no such term

145
00:06:13,939 --> 00:06:17,210
called def the cops but then we have to

146
00:06:17,210 --> 00:06:20,000
bring attention off developers or

147
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:22,219
operations teams or DevOps are the whole

148
00:06:22,219 --> 00:06:24,169
organization that we do need to

149
00:06:24,169 --> 00:06:26,659
implement security as part of the ICD

150
00:06:26,659 --> 00:06:28,819
pipelines our DevOps the reason for that

151
00:06:28,819 --> 00:06:32,270
is we have been talking about security

152
00:06:32,270 --> 00:06:34,939
is everyone's responsibility and no and

153
00:06:34,939 --> 00:06:38,300
we can realize I know how well we have

154
00:06:38,300 --> 00:06:40,880
implemented this as as a security team

155
00:06:40,880 --> 00:06:42,320
and we still see there's a lot of

156
00:06:42,320 --> 00:06:44,300
disconnect or silos between various

157
00:06:44,300 --> 00:06:46,970
teams organizations various teams and

158
00:06:46,970 --> 00:06:48,560
across the organization is a lot of

159
00:06:48,560 --> 00:06:51,560
silos and we do regularly talk about we

160
00:06:51,560 --> 00:06:53,000
need to concentrate on people and

161
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:56,450
processes and technologies and deaf

162
00:06:56,450 --> 00:06:58,670
Cyclops provides you the framework to

163
00:06:58,670 --> 00:07:01,070
implement these things in practice all

164
00:07:01,070 --> 00:07:04,550
right and in order to implement - the

165
00:07:04,550 --> 00:07:06,860
cops I believe you need to have four

166
00:07:06,860 --> 00:07:10,100
important principles are you have to

167
00:07:10,100 --> 00:07:13,160
implement core these four principles one

168
00:07:13,160 --> 00:07:15,410
among them is culture and probably the

169
00:07:15,410 --> 00:07:17,540
least appreciated our needs understand

170
00:07:17,540 --> 00:07:20,900
understood aspect Alpha Delta cops is

171
00:07:20,900 --> 00:07:24,020
culture usually people are drawn towards

172
00:07:24,020 --> 00:07:26,030
automation because that the shiniest are

173
00:07:26,030 --> 00:07:29,660
the most sexy aspect of Delta cops

174
00:07:29,660 --> 00:07:32,210
whereas if you don't work on culture

175
00:07:32,210 --> 00:07:35,990
right what happens is that all of these

176
00:07:35,990 --> 00:07:38,090
other aspects of deaths aircrafts will

177
00:07:38,090 --> 00:07:40,280
suffer if you don't have culture then

178
00:07:40,280 --> 00:07:41,990
automation will suffer and similarly

179
00:07:41,990 --> 00:07:44,450
measurement and sharing you can call and

180
00:07:44,450 --> 00:07:47,150
as part of these people practices you

181
00:07:47,150 --> 00:07:49,490
have culture and measurement and sharing

182
00:07:49,490 --> 00:07:51,770
which boils down to you trying to

183
00:07:51,770 --> 00:07:54,590
continuously share the feedback to your

184
00:07:54,590 --> 00:07:56,300
end customer for you that is their

185
00:07:56,300 --> 00:07:57,950
developers or devops teams

186
00:07:57,950 --> 00:08:00,170
wherein you will provide this is the

187
00:08:00,170 --> 00:08:02,810
state of security for your app or your

188
00:08:02,810 --> 00:08:05,120
organization we want to make sure this

189
00:08:05,120 --> 00:08:07,250
does not happen next time and we want to

190
00:08:07,250 --> 00:08:09,770
also ensure that we use the tools which

191
00:08:09,770 --> 00:08:12,020
are you spite of the purse our operation

192
00:08:12,020 --> 00:08:13,400
stinks instead of creating our own

193
00:08:13,400 --> 00:08:16,430
tooling it would be much much better to

194
00:08:16,430 --> 00:08:18,560
use the tooling off developers and that

195
00:08:18,560 --> 00:08:20,660
will reduce your context switch between

196
00:08:20,660 --> 00:08:22,600
moving from a developer friendly tool

197
00:08:22,600 --> 00:08:25,940
versus and then moving on to a very

198
00:08:25,940 --> 00:08:28,160
security focused tool and when the

199
00:08:28,160 --> 00:08:30,110
developers do context switch the

200
00:08:30,110 --> 00:08:32,270
meantime to remediate vulnerabilities

201
00:08:32,270 --> 00:08:34,490
will drastically increase we have seen

202
00:08:34,490 --> 00:08:37,159
that if you provide information to

203
00:08:37,159 --> 00:08:40,130
developers at the right time a derived

204
00:08:40,130 --> 00:08:42,320
place and with right amount of context

205
00:08:42,320 --> 00:08:44,720
then they will be able to fix the 1tt

206
00:08:44,720 --> 00:08:46,880
pretty easily in a very sharp span of

207
00:08:46,880 --> 00:08:48,830
time in one of the organization's you

208
00:08:48,830 --> 00:08:50,450
have seen that the mean time to

209
00:08:50,450 --> 00:08:53,120
remediate has decreased from two months

210
00:08:53,120 --> 00:08:54,310
to just fifteen

211
00:08:54,310 --> 00:08:56,800
minutes because they were evil to see

212
00:08:56,800 --> 00:08:59,920
the issues early on and the plays build

213
00:08:59,920 --> 00:09:01,660
they love to see that which is most

214
00:09:01,660 --> 00:09:05,590
probably your CI CD pipelines hi and

215
00:09:05,590 --> 00:09:07,930
then if you move on from a process

216
00:09:07,930 --> 00:09:09,370
perspective right

217
00:09:09,370 --> 00:09:11,740
we have measurement and sharing and it's

218
00:09:11,740 --> 00:09:14,650
very imperative that we provide the

219
00:09:14,650 --> 00:09:16,600
feedback and the information and the

220
00:09:16,600 --> 00:09:19,029
metrics to the developers where they

221
00:09:19,029 --> 00:09:22,089
need it which is typically your CI CD

222
00:09:22,089 --> 00:09:23,770
pipeline I have seen a tremendous amount

223
00:09:23,770 --> 00:09:26,110
of improvement in terms of how

224
00:09:26,110 --> 00:09:28,089
organizations do security you when they

225
00:09:28,089 --> 00:09:29,800
expose these metrics to your

226
00:09:29,800 --> 00:09:31,660
organization maybe you have a dashboard

227
00:09:31,660 --> 00:09:34,660
which lists down okay we have ten

228
00:09:34,660 --> 00:09:37,630
different projects and each of them are

229
00:09:37,630 --> 00:09:40,510
either in the red green or orange based

230
00:09:40,510 --> 00:09:43,210
on the maturity of that cigars and that

231
00:09:43,210 --> 00:09:46,180
drastically improves the feedback and

232
00:09:46,180 --> 00:09:47,890
the education and the witness in the

233
00:09:47,890 --> 00:09:49,810
company and will help you achieve

234
00:09:49,810 --> 00:09:53,710
massive gains in how we we see us how we

235
00:09:53,710 --> 00:09:56,860
see security similarly when it comes to

236
00:09:56,860 --> 00:10:00,040
technology automation will help you

237
00:10:00,040 --> 00:10:02,320
achieve the speed and if you do this

238
00:10:02,320 --> 00:10:04,000
we'll have a lot of benefits

239
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:07,150
specifically the speed reliability and

240
00:10:07,150 --> 00:10:09,850
flexibility and one side effect of speed

241
00:10:09,850 --> 00:10:13,750
is if if an organization is doing a

242
00:10:13,750 --> 00:10:16,000
waterfall model and in order to fix the

243
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:18,670
vulnerability they might need probably

244
00:10:18,670 --> 00:10:20,589
an ear to fix the vulnerability because

245
00:10:20,589 --> 00:10:23,140
the development or the deployment

246
00:10:23,140 --> 00:10:25,540
cadence is once a year so you have to

247
00:10:25,540 --> 00:10:27,610
wait a complete year to fix the

248
00:10:27,610 --> 00:10:30,550
vulnerability in production whereas with

249
00:10:30,550 --> 00:10:32,410
the help of DevOps our deficit curves

250
00:10:32,410 --> 00:10:34,540
you will be able to fin fix that

251
00:10:34,540 --> 00:10:36,940
vulnerability very frequently maybe

252
00:10:36,940 --> 00:10:38,620
these developers are pushing code to

253
00:10:38,620 --> 00:10:40,630
production every nine seconds you have

254
00:10:40,630 --> 00:10:42,790
ability to fix a vulnerability also

255
00:10:42,790 --> 00:10:46,089
every nine second that provides massive

256
00:10:46,089 --> 00:10:49,380
gains to both security and deficit ops

257
00:10:49,380 --> 00:10:53,350
now if DevOps or death circus provides

258
00:10:53,350 --> 00:10:55,959
so many benefits why are we not doing it

259
00:10:55,959 --> 00:10:57,700
right what are the current problems

260
00:10:57,700 --> 00:10:59,740
which compliance teams are facing in

261
00:10:59,740 --> 00:11:02,050
order to implement these technologies

262
00:11:02,050 --> 00:11:04,720
right let's talk about that and we'll

263
00:11:04,720 --> 00:11:07,180
explore this with the help of a very

264
00:11:07,180 --> 00:11:08,080
simple case

265
00:11:08,080 --> 00:11:10,570
we have this imaginary company called

266
00:11:10,570 --> 00:11:13,660
tiara their education platform and they

267
00:11:13,660 --> 00:11:15,010
are doing pretty good for themselves

268
00:11:15,010 --> 00:11:17,140
they just have their say just finish

269
00:11:17,140 --> 00:11:19,330
their CDC and they are doing pretty good

270
00:11:19,330 --> 00:11:21,940
for themself and because of the exposure

271
00:11:21,940 --> 00:11:24,580
in the media they got attention from

272
00:11:24,580 --> 00:11:26,920
hackers as well and because of that they

273
00:11:26,920 --> 00:11:29,920
just saw that they got breached twice

274
00:11:29,920 --> 00:11:32,320
not just once but twice in order to fix

275
00:11:32,320 --> 00:11:35,200
this they hired bribe and the first

276
00:11:35,200 --> 00:11:37,270
thing which Brad did as soon as he came

277
00:11:37,270 --> 00:11:39,700
in he did the gap analysis or threat

278
00:11:39,700 --> 00:11:41,170
modeling the risk assessment and he

279
00:11:41,170 --> 00:11:44,890
realized that the organizations are his

280
00:11:44,890 --> 00:11:46,990
organization got compromised because

281
00:11:46,990 --> 00:11:48,190
they were not hardening the

282
00:11:48,190 --> 00:11:50,080
infrastructure and then they are not

283
00:11:50,080 --> 00:11:53,100
also ensuring that we are continuously

284
00:11:53,100 --> 00:11:55,810
checking for compliance right and they

285
00:11:55,810 --> 00:11:57,610
also realized that there is a huge

286
00:11:57,610 --> 00:11:59,290
attack surface in terms of application

287
00:11:59,290 --> 00:12:02,380
itself then you have they were wonderful

288
00:12:02,380 --> 00:12:06,490
too or stop them so that's one of the

289
00:12:06,490 --> 00:12:08,770
problem he had and before he solved it

290
00:12:08,770 --> 00:12:12,130
he also saw that security and compliance

291
00:12:12,130 --> 00:12:15,730
teams on you know outnumbered so his

292
00:12:15,730 --> 00:12:17,860
ratio was for every hundred developers

293
00:12:17,860 --> 00:12:20,560
he had one security engineer so the

294
00:12:20,560 --> 00:12:22,630
organization had about 200 developers

295
00:12:22,630 --> 00:12:24,400
and he only had two people who were

296
00:12:24,400 --> 00:12:26,620
dedicated to security one for network

297
00:12:26,620 --> 00:12:28,560
side of security more of a traditional

298
00:12:28,560 --> 00:12:31,660
infrastructure send Lisa who was

299
00:12:31,660 --> 00:12:33,360
responsible for application security

300
00:12:33,360 --> 00:12:36,280
that's one problem he faced but as soon

301
00:12:36,280 --> 00:12:37,560
as they tried to implement security

302
00:12:37,560 --> 00:12:40,150
brought in lot of processes best

303
00:12:40,150 --> 00:12:42,430
practices compliance and standards and

304
00:12:42,430 --> 00:12:45,130
rules they realize that the DevOps teams

305
00:12:45,130 --> 00:12:46,810
because T Chara is a very

306
00:12:46,810 --> 00:12:48,700
forward-looking company and they are

307
00:12:48,700 --> 00:12:51,570
using deff DevOps practices to achieve

308
00:12:51,570 --> 00:12:54,070
faster feedback with their customers and

309
00:12:54,070 --> 00:12:56,920
provide good value or features to the

310
00:12:56,920 --> 00:12:58,750
customer on a regular basis and then

311
00:12:58,750 --> 00:13:01,210
realize that the quickly the DevOps

312
00:13:01,210 --> 00:13:03,430
teams are reluctant to work with

313
00:13:03,430 --> 00:13:06,640
security and then when they did a survey

314
00:13:06,640 --> 00:13:10,060
with the help of different is CT or CIO

315
00:13:10,060 --> 00:13:11,560
they realized that they don't want to

316
00:13:11,560 --> 00:13:14,440
work with security because they don't

317
00:13:14,440 --> 00:13:16,690
know how the security works in it how

318
00:13:16,690 --> 00:13:19,630
the DevOps bugs and their tools and how

319
00:13:19,630 --> 00:13:21,310
the tools are pretty slow and how did

320
00:13:21,310 --> 00:13:21,910
the tool

321
00:13:21,910 --> 00:13:23,860
reduce the speed at which they go to

322
00:13:23,860 --> 00:13:26,710
production right so that's the one

323
00:13:26,710 --> 00:13:28,300
problem we face the first problem we

324
00:13:28,300 --> 00:13:29,830
have the security is outnumber second

325
00:13:29,830 --> 00:13:32,950
problems second problem is the security

326
00:13:32,950 --> 00:13:34,930
tooling other the culture or the

327
00:13:34,930 --> 00:13:37,270
automation or the processes are not yet

328
00:13:37,270 --> 00:13:39,820
ready for DevOps right and then you

329
00:13:39,820 --> 00:13:41,770
typically see if you want to automate

330
00:13:41,770 --> 00:13:43,600
compliance are just doing traditional

331
00:13:43,600 --> 00:13:45,850
compliance you'll be asked to fill bunch

332
00:13:45,850 --> 00:13:49,540
of Excel sheets and probably most likely

333
00:13:49,540 --> 00:13:51,850
that same information will be repeated

334
00:13:51,850 --> 00:13:54,580
again and again or in different Excel

335
00:13:54,580 --> 00:13:56,320
shapes so that's not a problem which

336
00:13:56,320 --> 00:14:00,840
DevOps team how with compliance and then

337
00:14:00,840 --> 00:14:03,220
there's a other argument now that people

338
00:14:03,220 --> 00:14:05,860
say okay can you guarantee if we are

339
00:14:05,860 --> 00:14:07,650
compliant that you're not beginning hack

340
00:14:07,650 --> 00:14:10,720
right so compliance doesn't mean that we

341
00:14:10,720 --> 00:14:12,100
are secure or vice versa

342
00:14:12,100 --> 00:14:14,980
right it's a side effect of security but

343
00:14:14,980 --> 00:14:16,840
then when you are compliant it doesn't

344
00:14:16,840 --> 00:14:18,400
mean the security is taking care of

345
00:14:18,400 --> 00:14:22,350
altogether right and it will see typical

346
00:14:22,350 --> 00:14:25,420
scenarios like Equifax and Capital One

347
00:14:25,420 --> 00:14:27,340
and all these are some of the companies

348
00:14:27,340 --> 00:14:29,080
which were compliant to different

349
00:14:29,080 --> 00:14:31,870
standards but then they still got hacked

350
00:14:31,870 --> 00:14:34,900
because they missed it are you know this

351
00:14:34,900 --> 00:14:36,730
is so much of technology there's so much

352
00:14:36,730 --> 00:14:38,770
of change going on a regular basis in

353
00:14:38,770 --> 00:14:40,480
DevOps environment that it's very

354
00:14:40,480 --> 00:14:42,820
difficult to keep up and one such way of

355
00:14:42,820 --> 00:14:45,610
handling this chaos or handing this urn

356
00:14:45,610 --> 00:14:48,850
security is the devops of course no one

357
00:14:48,850 --> 00:14:52,300
is fine no one is trying to say that you

358
00:14:52,300 --> 00:14:54,040
will be able to catch hundred percent of

359
00:14:54,040 --> 00:14:57,100
the issues but probably we can gain 60

360
00:14:57,100 --> 00:14:59,260
to 80 percent of the quick wins if we

361
00:14:59,260 --> 00:15:01,240
implement security and compliance as far

362
00:15:01,240 --> 00:15:03,850
as CI CD pipelines all right now let's

363
00:15:03,850 --> 00:15:06,960
look at how organizations are doing

364
00:15:06,960 --> 00:15:08,650
security nice

365
00:15:08,650 --> 00:15:11,800
so typically organizations fill up the

366
00:15:11,800 --> 00:15:13,750
forms Excel sheets and then they provide

367
00:15:13,750 --> 00:15:16,840
it to auditors but when the advent of

368
00:15:16,840 --> 00:15:19,330
DevOps at the container technology an

369
00:15:19,330 --> 00:15:21,880
average age of a container is just to a

370
00:15:21,880 --> 00:15:25,900
large and it's very difficult in that 12

371
00:15:25,900 --> 00:15:27,970
hours to harden the infrastructure and

372
00:15:27,970 --> 00:15:29,710
then to ensure that it's compliant

373
00:15:29,710 --> 00:15:31,450
according to your policies unless you

374
00:15:31,450 --> 00:15:32,920
are continuously auditing it

375
00:15:32,920 --> 00:15:34,720
continuously measuring it and

376
00:15:34,720 --> 00:15:35,410
continuously

377
00:15:35,410 --> 00:15:37,569
making sure that it stays compliant

378
00:15:37,569 --> 00:15:41,379
right so if we do implement if we do

379
00:15:41,379 --> 00:15:43,300
implement compliance I scored we will

380
00:15:43,300 --> 00:15:45,370
achieve all of these benefit ends just

381
00:15:45,370 --> 00:15:47,500
like security compliance is in a similar

382
00:15:47,500 --> 00:15:51,100
boat as well right if 100 is to one is

383
00:15:51,100 --> 00:15:52,360
the ratio between developers and

384
00:15:52,360 --> 00:15:55,930
security security team versus the

385
00:15:55,930 --> 00:15:58,149
compliance team are risking the GRC team

386
00:15:58,149 --> 00:16:00,819
whatever you call them is the similar

387
00:16:00,819 --> 00:16:03,220
look for for every 10 security engineers

388
00:16:03,220 --> 00:16:05,470
probably you have one compliance person

389
00:16:05,470 --> 00:16:07,180
or one GRC person so they are also

390
00:16:07,180 --> 00:16:10,899
outnumbered right and then with the

391
00:16:10,899 --> 00:16:13,899
continual technology you can scale the

392
00:16:13,899 --> 00:16:16,329
docker containers from hundreds to

393
00:16:16,329 --> 00:16:18,399
thousands just in a matter of seconds

394
00:16:18,399 --> 00:16:21,459
and keeping up with the volume is very

395
00:16:21,459 --> 00:16:23,949
very difficult unless the automate the

396
00:16:23,949 --> 00:16:27,250
compliance aspect of that set ups and

397
00:16:27,250 --> 00:16:29,379
apart from that it helps you provide

398
00:16:29,379 --> 00:16:31,240
faster feedback so that you don't have

399
00:16:31,240 --> 00:16:35,430
to look for a way to be stored that

400
00:16:35,430 --> 00:16:38,800
Excel shape all right with just a click

401
00:16:38,800 --> 00:16:41,620
of a button you will be able to bring in

402
00:16:41,620 --> 00:16:44,949
a list of compliance reports which

403
00:16:44,949 --> 00:16:47,079
auditors can easily reviewed by click of

404
00:16:47,079 --> 00:16:48,819
a button they will be able to generate

405
00:16:48,819 --> 00:16:50,889
reports from across the repositories

406
00:16:50,889 --> 00:16:52,899
across infrastructure and that gives

407
00:16:52,899 --> 00:16:55,180
confer even to the auditors that yes

408
00:16:55,180 --> 00:16:57,930
they are are doing security even in

409
00:16:57,930 --> 00:17:00,459
DevOps environments and one problem we

410
00:17:00,459 --> 00:17:03,209
also see is that sometimes you need to

411
00:17:03,209 --> 00:17:06,429
educate auditors themselves that hey

412
00:17:06,429 --> 00:17:09,130
this is how we do security in devops

413
00:17:09,130 --> 00:17:12,130
world which is very drastic are very

414
00:17:12,130 --> 00:17:14,619
different if you look at your

415
00:17:14,619 --> 00:17:17,380
traditional compliance there are video

416
00:17:17,380 --> 00:17:19,480
provides a patient of duties we do

417
00:17:19,480 --> 00:17:24,400
provide trust but verify and a trust but

418
00:17:24,400 --> 00:17:28,870
verify as a the phenomena but then we do

419
00:17:28,870 --> 00:17:30,760
it in a very different way in DevOps and

420
00:17:30,760 --> 00:17:32,250
it's drastically different from

421
00:17:32,250 --> 00:17:35,169
waterfall model and it also provides you

422
00:17:35,169 --> 00:17:36,850
a repeatability if you if you automate a

423
00:17:36,850 --> 00:17:38,590
one system you can very well automate it

424
00:17:38,590 --> 00:17:40,480
scale it across the different systems

425
00:17:40,480 --> 00:17:43,480
right either oh and there are different

426
00:17:43,480 --> 00:17:45,340
ways of handling compliance one way is

427
00:17:45,340 --> 00:17:46,899
you could just continue whatever you are

428
00:17:46,899 --> 00:17:49,000
doing but this definitely doesn't work

429
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:49,310
in

430
00:17:49,310 --> 00:17:50,960
LOB's environments so you need to

431
00:17:50,960 --> 00:17:53,450
improve upon what we can do to achieve

432
00:17:53,450 --> 00:17:55,730
the speed which developers are looking

433
00:17:55,730 --> 00:17:57,440
so that we won't be a bottleneck to them

434
00:17:57,440 --> 00:18:00,530
right one such way without implement

435
00:18:00,530 --> 00:18:04,040
without implement without costing you a

436
00:18:04,040 --> 00:18:06,020
huge amount of money is use the existing

437
00:18:06,020 --> 00:18:08,060
configuration management system be it

438
00:18:08,060 --> 00:18:11,510
you know terraform cloud formation or if

439
00:18:11,510 --> 00:18:13,370
you're using our internal system maybe

440
00:18:13,370 --> 00:18:16,130
you have ansible chef puppet you can use

441
00:18:16,130 --> 00:18:18,380
those also to achieve compliance or you

442
00:18:18,380 --> 00:18:20,450
can use dedicated tooling like you have

443
00:18:20,450 --> 00:18:23,720
all open policy agent inspect and

444
00:18:23,720 --> 00:18:27,020
whatnot right so with that what I will

445
00:18:27,020 --> 00:18:29,330
do is I'll show you a quick demo on how

446
00:18:29,330 --> 00:18:32,450
a traditional pipeline our traditional

447
00:18:32,450 --> 00:18:35,060
compliance initiative can be move to a

448
00:18:35,060 --> 00:18:37,250
CI CD pipeline and still can provide you

449
00:18:37,250 --> 00:18:38,660
a lot of benefit and you can automate

450
00:18:38,660 --> 00:18:40,790
about 60 to 80 percent of your

451
00:18:40,790 --> 00:18:42,980
compliance efforts no matter if you are

452
00:18:42,980 --> 00:18:46,880
using an online system or on comprar on

453
00:18:46,880 --> 00:18:50,090
cloud system let's look into a quick

454
00:18:50,090 --> 00:18:53,690
example here so what you're seeing here

455
00:18:53,690 --> 00:18:57,290
is a good lab CI implementation and CI

456
00:18:57,290 --> 00:18:59,510
CD pipeline implementation and don't let

457
00:18:59,510 --> 00:19:01,400
this scare you but what I want to show

458
00:19:01,400 --> 00:19:03,970
you is that we have automated here

459
00:19:03,970 --> 00:19:06,410
compliance with just two lines of code

460
00:19:06,410 --> 00:19:08,780
which is this as you can see here we

461
00:19:08,780 --> 00:19:12,140
have been installing a tool calling spec

462
00:19:12,140 --> 00:19:13,790
it's a free open-source tool to do

463
00:19:13,790 --> 00:19:16,190
compliance escort and you see we are

464
00:19:16,190 --> 00:19:20,300
hardening a Linux operating system which

465
00:19:20,300 --> 00:19:22,850
is at the IP address ten dot zero dot

466
00:19:22,850 --> 00:19:27,590
one dot 22 and then see how active or

467
00:19:27,590 --> 00:19:30,170
how how compliant is this machine right

468
00:19:30,170 --> 00:19:33,800
as you can see when we run this pipeline

469
00:19:33,800 --> 00:19:37,160
you'll see that we ran a bunch of tests

470
00:19:37,160 --> 00:19:39,500
here probably about 100 here and then

471
00:19:39,500 --> 00:19:43,490
above this 100 we have about 21 success

472
00:19:43,490 --> 00:19:45,770
column we have we made sure that 21 of

473
00:19:45,770 --> 00:19:49,040
these controls were successful meaning

474
00:19:49,040 --> 00:19:50,590
that we are still adhering to those

475
00:19:50,590 --> 00:19:53,750
compliance initiatives or compliance

476
00:19:53,750 --> 00:19:57,890
aspects off be it be you know PCI DSS or

477
00:19:57,890 --> 00:20:00,590
whatnot and then among these 30 controls

478
00:20:00,590 --> 00:20:02,630
failed which means you still have what

479
00:20:02,630 --> 00:20:03,260
to do

480
00:20:03,260 --> 00:20:05,120
but if you look at it some of these are

481
00:20:05,120 --> 00:20:11,059
not other some of them are not so severe

482
00:20:11,059 --> 00:20:13,309
that they you will feel your compliance

483
00:20:13,309 --> 00:20:15,110
objectives so you will fail your audits

484
00:20:15,110 --> 00:20:17,299
and then you can come your team can then

485
00:20:17,299 --> 00:20:19,309
put this into black backlog and then

486
00:20:19,309 --> 00:20:20,540
country its leave straight on it and

487
00:20:20,540 --> 00:20:22,610
make sure that you don't have any vets

488
00:20:22,610 --> 00:20:23,030
here

489
00:20:23,030 --> 00:20:24,860
so the green is good here and the red is

490
00:20:24,860 --> 00:20:27,799
bad and you might be wondering if we do

491
00:20:27,799 --> 00:20:30,380
do compliance that's good maybe takes a

492
00:20:30,380 --> 00:20:32,240
lot of time for you to do and as you can

493
00:20:32,240 --> 00:20:34,549
see this is a pipeline which is which I

494
00:20:34,549 --> 00:20:38,660
just run as you can see the entire the

495
00:20:38,660 --> 00:20:41,660
entire pipeline can be done in just six

496
00:20:41,660 --> 00:20:44,330
minutes and 21 40 43 seconds as you can

497
00:20:44,330 --> 00:20:46,160
see I'm running static analysis to

498
00:20:46,160 --> 00:20:49,280
ensure we are complying to different

499
00:20:49,280 --> 00:20:51,919
audits or these different standards that

500
00:20:51,919 --> 00:20:54,650
we have to have static analysis as part

501
00:20:54,650 --> 00:20:56,510
of CIC systems as part of our

502
00:20:56,510 --> 00:21:00,290
development we also are testing here for

503
00:21:00,290 --> 00:21:02,750
se a dependency scanning right we are

504
00:21:02,750 --> 00:21:04,520
also making sure our containers are

505
00:21:04,520 --> 00:21:06,260
secure from bugs and vulnerabilities

506
00:21:06,260 --> 00:21:08,210
with the help of artifact scanning and

507
00:21:08,210 --> 00:21:09,919
we are also making sure that we run

508
00:21:09,919 --> 00:21:11,870
dynamic analysis scans on a regular

509
00:21:11,870 --> 00:21:14,570
basis before they go before we deploy to

510
00:21:14,570 --> 00:21:17,780
staging a production environment and you

511
00:21:17,780 --> 00:21:19,460
should notice in the production we are

512
00:21:19,460 --> 00:21:22,100
making sure the environment is hardened

513
00:21:22,100 --> 00:21:24,919
on probably every deployment and then

514
00:21:24,919 --> 00:21:26,570
you're also making sure this employee

515
00:21:26,570 --> 00:21:29,960
this interest of just stay is compliant

516
00:21:29,960 --> 00:21:33,350
and this can be configured on a per

517
00:21:33,350 --> 00:21:35,210
commit basis or on a third deployment

518
00:21:35,210 --> 00:21:36,950
basis on a regular interval maybe you

519
00:21:36,950 --> 00:21:39,049
want to make sure our system is still

520
00:21:39,049 --> 00:21:41,840
compliant every 12 hours and if you

521
00:21:41,840 --> 00:21:43,309
click on this link on the compliance

522
00:21:43,309 --> 00:21:45,799
aspect of here as you see it just took

523
00:21:45,799 --> 00:21:48,110
me one minute and 21 seconds to achieve

524
00:21:48,110 --> 00:21:51,350
this and I've automated this with just

525
00:21:51,350 --> 00:21:53,720
two lines of code and then we were able

526
00:21:53,720 --> 00:21:56,540
to find out if the system is still

527
00:21:56,540 --> 00:21:59,270
compliant after we hardening it in just

528
00:21:59,270 --> 00:22:03,970
one minute and it will also see that

529
00:22:05,380 --> 00:22:08,090
this is very easy to do as well okay

530
00:22:08,090 --> 00:22:12,100
let's look at an example when people

531
00:22:12,100 --> 00:22:13,690
you know compliance has code we can

532
00:22:13,690 --> 00:22:15,430
automate compliance and scored and is

533
00:22:15,430 --> 00:22:16,900
usually say okay

534
00:22:16,900 --> 00:22:20,710
Imran this is all good and fair but I

535
00:22:20,710 --> 00:22:22,420
probably don't know how to code but

536
00:22:22,420 --> 00:22:24,940
let's explore why that's not a big issue

537
00:22:24,940 --> 00:22:26,890
as you can see the syntax that you see

538
00:22:26,890 --> 00:22:29,440
on your screen the code though it looks

539
00:22:29,440 --> 00:22:31,930
scary is just a couple of lines of yeah

540
00:22:31,930 --> 00:22:34,990
no it's a one file format which is

541
00:22:34,990 --> 00:22:37,480
traditionally used by modern DevOps

542
00:22:37,480 --> 00:22:40,060
tooling be it you know see ICD pipelines

543
00:22:40,060 --> 00:22:43,120
communities and different other modern

544
00:22:43,120 --> 00:22:46,660
systems even open policy engine and as

545
00:22:46,660 --> 00:22:48,880
you can see here we are just running a

546
00:22:48,880 --> 00:22:52,420
tool using ansible here we are trying to

547
00:22:52,420 --> 00:22:54,490
hard an infrastructure with the help of

548
00:22:54,490 --> 00:22:58,000
open source a roll hardening roll call

549
00:22:58,000 --> 00:23:00,400
OS hardening from the pop dev - side

550
00:23:00,400 --> 00:23:02,560
project and in order to run this all you

551
00:23:02,560 --> 00:23:05,410
have to do is just run that command and

552
00:23:05,410 --> 00:23:07,390
simple playbook and spell hardening and

553
00:23:07,390 --> 00:23:09,880
eventually you want to make sure once we

554
00:23:09,880 --> 00:23:12,730
harden it it stays compliant to our

555
00:23:12,730 --> 00:23:15,790
standards right whatever standards that

556
00:23:15,790 --> 00:23:18,390
policies we have taught you to write and

557
00:23:18,390 --> 00:23:22,000
you can easily create a PCI DSS our

558
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:25,300
socks off - compliant with the help of

559
00:23:25,300 --> 00:23:27,220
inspector it's a free open source we

560
00:23:27,220 --> 00:23:29,530
look into what that is in a minute and

561
00:23:29,530 --> 00:23:32,140
in order to run this all you have to do

562
00:23:32,140 --> 00:23:34,600
is just run one liner you know and as

563
00:23:34,600 --> 00:23:35,830
you can see here we are running it on a

564
00:23:35,830 --> 00:23:38,080
Windows machine the posture of that is

565
00:23:38,080 --> 00:23:39,610
steps across there's a bunch of ways of

566
00:23:39,610 --> 00:23:42,070
running it on Linux machine docker

567
00:23:42,070 --> 00:23:45,010
containers what-have-you right now as I

568
00:23:45,010 --> 00:23:47,080
mentioned people are really really

569
00:23:47,080 --> 00:23:50,350
scared about code when we say compliance

570
00:23:50,350 --> 00:23:52,270
I scored infrastructure as code security

571
00:23:52,270 --> 00:23:56,070
escort they are very scared but fact is

572
00:23:56,070 --> 00:23:58,720
whatever you call it security is code

573
00:23:58,720 --> 00:24:00,490
compliance has called infrastructure

574
00:24:00,490 --> 00:24:03,700
less code it's just you know a bunch of

575
00:24:03,700 --> 00:24:05,770
text files or Yaman files which help you

576
00:24:05,770 --> 00:24:08,680
achieve compliance or security in aspect

577
00:24:08,680 --> 00:24:10,780
of it and and people you might be

578
00:24:10,780 --> 00:24:12,270
laughing at it but that's the reality

579
00:24:12,270 --> 00:24:15,400
all right it's very very easy to do

580
00:24:15,400 --> 00:24:17,440
compliance we now have all the

581
00:24:17,440 --> 00:24:19,270
technological pieces to implement

582
00:24:19,270 --> 00:24:21,340
compliance and automate compliance with

583
00:24:21,340 --> 00:24:24,970
ease and an inspect is such a tool which

584
00:24:24,970 --> 00:24:25,570
helps you

585
00:24:25,570 --> 00:24:27,790
made this and it's very easy to

586
00:24:27,790 --> 00:24:29,770
understand and then you know and you can

587
00:24:29,770 --> 00:24:31,960
do automation if you can understand

588
00:24:31,960 --> 00:24:33,610
English language you can automate with

589
00:24:33,610 --> 00:24:35,830
the help of inspect and it supports

590
00:24:35,830 --> 00:24:37,930
bunch of operating systems and it has

591
00:24:37,930 --> 00:24:40,420
extensive extensive language if you want

592
00:24:40,420 --> 00:24:42,640
to improve add and improve it further

593
00:24:42,640 --> 00:24:44,830
then you can definitely do that and then

594
00:24:44,830 --> 00:24:47,350
a typical see a typical workflow of how

595
00:24:47,350 --> 00:24:49,990
this looks like would be you will start

596
00:24:49,990 --> 00:24:52,360
off with hardening the infrastructure

597
00:24:52,360 --> 00:24:55,300
and once your heart in it in order to

598
00:24:55,300 --> 00:24:57,670
ensure that this stays compliant you

599
00:24:57,670 --> 00:25:00,460
regularly run the your compliance checks

600
00:25:00,460 --> 00:25:02,770
on this one and as soon as your change

601
00:25:02,770 --> 00:25:05,110
compliance checks fail you you can

602
00:25:05,110 --> 00:25:07,450
automatically start the hardening aspect

603
00:25:07,450 --> 00:25:10,270
or you can email your operations team or

604
00:25:10,270 --> 00:25:12,130
your security team or your sock

605
00:25:12,130 --> 00:25:14,740
operations as well and if the tests pass

606
00:25:14,740 --> 00:25:17,050
then you don't have any action to do you

607
00:25:17,050 --> 00:25:19,570
can very well be move on to the next

608
00:25:19,570 --> 00:25:21,880
stage and then do what you're good at

609
00:25:21,880 --> 00:25:24,490
which is trying to make sure our

610
00:25:24,490 --> 00:25:26,950
organization reduces the risk both from

611
00:25:26,950 --> 00:25:28,510
a business perspective and also from

612
00:25:28,510 --> 00:25:31,510
technology perspective and then if we do

613
00:25:31,510 --> 00:25:33,640
all of this we will achieve compliance

614
00:25:33,640 --> 00:25:35,740
objectives compliance has scored

615
00:25:35,740 --> 00:25:38,080
objectives right and as you can see on

616
00:25:38,080 --> 00:25:38,740
your screen

617
00:25:38,740 --> 00:25:41,290
it's very easy to write Hansel as you

618
00:25:41,290 --> 00:25:43,450
can see what we are saying here is that

619
00:25:43,450 --> 00:25:46,660
part of pci-dss we have to run an

620
00:25:46,660 --> 00:25:48,940
anti-virus software on each machine as

621
00:25:48,940 --> 00:25:51,430
you can see the second line there which

622
00:25:51,430 --> 00:25:54,010
says describe service clamavi which is

623
00:25:54,010 --> 00:25:55,720
an operating system and we are making

624
00:25:55,720 --> 00:25:58,360
sure it should be installed it should be

625
00:25:58,360 --> 00:26:00,100
enabled and it should be running as

626
00:26:00,100 --> 00:26:01,900
simple as that if you can understand

627
00:26:01,900 --> 00:26:02,200
English

628
00:26:02,200 --> 00:26:04,330
you can write compliance as code scripts

629
00:26:04,330 --> 00:26:07,990
you will also see that we want to also

630
00:26:07,990 --> 00:26:09,730
make sure there is a file called etz

631
00:26:09,730 --> 00:26:11,530
password and then it should be a file

632
00:26:11,530 --> 00:26:13,900
and you do have lot of helpful guides

633
00:26:13,900 --> 00:26:15,760
like the CSI benchmarks to help you

634
00:26:15,760 --> 00:26:17,740
learn what these are and you can

635
00:26:17,740 --> 00:26:20,140
automate it and if you say that

636
00:26:20,140 --> 00:26:22,180
Imran I'm still not comfortable doing it

637
00:26:22,180 --> 00:26:24,940
you can hire a software developer and

638
00:26:24,940 --> 00:26:27,640
you can hire you can take help off your

639
00:26:27,640 --> 00:26:29,770
security team in order to in order for

640
00:26:29,770 --> 00:26:32,170
you to do this it's very easy to do

641
00:26:32,170 --> 00:26:33,550
again as I mentioned it runs on Windows

642
00:26:33,550 --> 00:26:38,919
Linux Mac you know even on mainframes

643
00:26:38,919 --> 00:26:41,619
as I mentioned before people have done a

644
00:26:41,619 --> 00:26:43,809
lot of work on this in order to automate

645
00:26:43,809 --> 00:26:45,399
compliance some of some aspects of

646
00:26:45,399 --> 00:26:47,950
compliance so 80 percent of your job is

647
00:26:47,950 --> 00:26:49,659
already then you only have to figure out

648
00:26:49,659 --> 00:26:51,759
the rest of this 20 percent which is

649
00:26:51,759 --> 00:26:55,419
usually involves tweaking these rule

650
00:26:55,419 --> 00:26:57,489
sets or profiles or controls according

651
00:26:57,489 --> 00:26:59,859
to your requirements let's say your own

652
00:26:59,859 --> 00:27:02,950
you only have to be compliant with PCI

653
00:27:02,950 --> 00:27:06,309
DSS then you will remove the standards

654
00:27:06,309 --> 00:27:08,859
of other probably again you can leave

655
00:27:08,859 --> 00:27:10,119
that be but if you think it's

656
00:27:10,119 --> 00:27:12,190
overwhelming you then probably you can

657
00:27:12,190 --> 00:27:14,259
say okay according to PCI DSS you have

658
00:27:14,259 --> 00:27:16,960
to adhere to these these these best

659
00:27:16,960 --> 00:27:19,389
practices we will unable that run those

660
00:27:19,389 --> 00:27:22,480
things for project 1 Project 8 and then

661
00:27:22,480 --> 00:27:24,820
project B has to be compliant with soft

662
00:27:24,820 --> 00:27:27,429
2 then probably you will improve these

663
00:27:27,429 --> 00:27:29,109
scripts or change these scripts to

664
00:27:29,109 --> 00:27:31,419
ensure we are running necessary

665
00:27:31,419 --> 00:27:33,340
automation then we are not necessary

666
00:27:33,340 --> 00:27:34,960
scripts to make sure that happens that

667
00:27:34,960 --> 00:27:39,629
right and DEF and high def - check

668
00:27:39,629 --> 00:27:41,980
hardening - framework is one such

669
00:27:41,980 --> 00:27:45,039
project which will help you achieve this

670
00:27:45,039 --> 00:27:47,859
kind of automation with ease and there

671
00:27:47,859 --> 00:27:50,559
are lot of automation be it for SSS

672
00:27:50,559 --> 00:27:55,179
Linux servers be it for you know CSI

673
00:27:55,179 --> 00:27:58,059
benchmarks and whatnot so definitely you

674
00:27:58,059 --> 00:28:00,820
can do this and then not only we have

675
00:28:00,820 --> 00:28:03,789
inspect you can also use ansible opens

676
00:28:03,789 --> 00:28:08,230
opens can even open policy agent to

677
00:28:08,230 --> 00:28:11,230
ensure you convert your policies as code

678
00:28:11,230 --> 00:28:14,080
and one of the problem we usually see is

679
00:28:14,080 --> 00:28:16,629
that your policy documents are a

680
00:28:16,629 --> 00:28:20,009
liability to you what do I mean by that

681
00:28:20,009 --> 00:28:22,450
you put in policy that these are the

682
00:28:22,450 --> 00:28:24,369
policies we follow in the organization

683
00:28:24,369 --> 00:28:26,109
when an auditor comes in they look at

684
00:28:26,109 --> 00:28:28,269
this policy and then they see oh you're

685
00:28:28,269 --> 00:28:30,009
not probably adhering to all of these

686
00:28:30,009 --> 00:28:35,409
and that usually calls usually involves

687
00:28:35,409 --> 00:28:37,509
convincing your order that yes we are

688
00:28:37,509 --> 00:28:39,970
trying to do security we have these

689
00:28:39,970 --> 00:28:41,830
different controls which mitigate this

690
00:28:41,830 --> 00:28:43,989
risk but when you have compliance as

691
00:28:43,989 --> 00:28:45,909
code you'll be able to just click on

692
00:28:45,909 --> 00:28:47,940
click a button and then create these

693
00:28:47,940 --> 00:28:51,789
nice dashboards metrics and even the

694
00:28:51,789 --> 00:28:52,200
report

695
00:28:52,200 --> 00:28:54,000
so that the car the auditors have

696
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:56,159
assurance that we are following it and

697
00:28:56,159 --> 00:28:59,220
then converting those policies into code

698
00:28:59,220 --> 00:29:01,769
allows you to enforce this on a regular

699
00:29:01,769 --> 00:29:04,380
basis even while this is happening in

700
00:29:04,380 --> 00:29:05,669
your staging environment or a

701
00:29:05,669 --> 00:29:07,049
development environment so you don't

702
00:29:07,049 --> 00:29:09,690
have to wait till the end right we all

703
00:29:09,690 --> 00:29:11,669
hear about this concept called shift

704
00:29:11,669 --> 00:29:14,669
left which ensures that we catch issues

705
00:29:14,669 --> 00:29:17,460
early on which also reduces your efforts

706
00:29:17,460 --> 00:29:20,070
when auditors are going to come into the

707
00:29:20,070 --> 00:29:21,929
organization to audit your organization

708
00:29:21,929 --> 00:29:25,139
against the compliance and also make

709
00:29:25,139 --> 00:29:28,260
sure that your team knows and understand

710
00:29:28,260 --> 00:29:30,690
what we need to do to achieve those

711
00:29:30,690 --> 00:29:34,409
compliance objectives right I think with

712
00:29:34,409 --> 00:29:39,899
that I will end my presentation Hey well

713
00:29:39,899 --> 00:29:43,620
thank you so much Mohamed again just

714
00:29:43,620 --> 00:29:44,880
reminder for everybody if you have

715
00:29:44,880 --> 00:29:46,769
questions for any of our speakers

716
00:29:46,769 --> 00:29:49,230
throughout the conference you can add

717
00:29:49,230 --> 00:29:51,630
those just right to the the chat window

718
00:29:51,630 --> 00:29:53,600
there umbrella

719
00:29:53,600 --> 00:29:56,669
Imran while we wait to see if anyone has

720
00:29:56,669 --> 00:30:01,110
any questions I am wondering you know as

721
00:30:01,110 --> 00:30:02,760
you look at organizations that do

722
00:30:02,760 --> 00:30:04,799
implement compliance as code is there a

723
00:30:04,799 --> 00:30:06,750
particular type of organization that you

724
00:30:06,750 --> 00:30:10,679
see that gets better use out of this or

725
00:30:10,679 --> 00:30:14,360
maybe is able to use it more effectively

726
00:30:14,360 --> 00:30:17,899
yeah so we do see a lot of organizations

727
00:30:17,899 --> 00:30:21,779
from my health care be you know even

728
00:30:21,779 --> 00:30:26,100
unicorns both in Asia and US and UK and

729
00:30:26,100 --> 00:30:27,870
you don't have you don't have to be

730
00:30:27,870 --> 00:30:29,700
unique on tour to benefit our talks on

731
00:30:29,700 --> 00:30:32,639
compliance escort so we do see even

732
00:30:32,639 --> 00:30:34,590
companies which are still in the process

733
00:30:34,590 --> 00:30:37,950
of doing the divorce transformation they

734
00:30:37,950 --> 00:30:40,380
still benefit if they can work on the

735
00:30:40,380 --> 00:30:42,120
culture the measurement and shading

736
00:30:42,120 --> 00:30:44,519
aspect of the even without automation

737
00:30:44,519 --> 00:30:47,250
all right so the quick wins definitely

738
00:30:47,250 --> 00:30:49,380
our automation could be achieved with

739
00:30:49,380 --> 00:30:50,850
the help of automation but even without

740
00:30:50,850 --> 00:30:53,370
automation you can see quick means for

741
00:30:53,370 --> 00:30:55,830
example now as soon as you convert your

742
00:30:55,830 --> 00:30:57,600
policy into a document which can be

743
00:30:57,600 --> 00:31:01,740
stored as part of your source code then

744
00:31:01,740 --> 00:31:03,269
they can be checked into part of the

745
00:31:03,269 --> 00:31:05,429
source code along with the project and

746
00:31:05,429 --> 00:31:05,910
then this

747
00:31:05,910 --> 00:31:09,030
okay if I have to go live I have to

748
00:31:09,030 --> 00:31:11,010
achieve these compliance objectives so

749
00:31:11,010 --> 00:31:14,330
you can use something like BDD security

750
00:31:14,330 --> 00:31:17,430
and gauntlet to make sure those things

751
00:31:17,430 --> 00:31:20,010
are being done while the developers are

752
00:31:20,010 --> 00:31:21,750
still coding it all right so if you

753
00:31:21,750 --> 00:31:23,610
don't even have to go to the end to

754
00:31:23,610 --> 00:31:26,130
achieve compliance objectives and then I

755
00:31:26,130 --> 00:31:28,290
have seen as I mentioned you even you

756
00:31:28,290 --> 00:31:32,010
can be a waterfall organization but by

757
00:31:32,010 --> 00:31:34,440
giving this information ASVs is a very

758
00:31:34,440 --> 00:31:35,430
good example of that

759
00:31:35,430 --> 00:31:40,860
os project yes yes that helps you look

760
00:31:40,860 --> 00:31:43,770
in looking from a security requirements

761
00:31:43,770 --> 00:31:46,020
perspective like if I have to achieve

762
00:31:46,020 --> 00:31:48,150
these compliance objectives what do I

763
00:31:48,150 --> 00:31:50,340
have to implement in my code or in my

764
00:31:50,340 --> 00:31:52,200
infrastructure or in my processes and

765
00:31:52,200 --> 00:31:55,020
then that will give you enough

766
00:31:55,020 --> 00:31:57,300
information from a project management

767
00:31:57,300 --> 00:32:00,270
perspective from and then also from a

768
00:32:00,270 --> 00:32:02,070
timeline perspective so they don't have

769
00:32:02,070 --> 00:32:04,800
to wait till the end to come back to you

770
00:32:04,800 --> 00:32:08,160
and say okay we are ready to go live can

771
00:32:08,160 --> 00:32:09,630
you please make sure that we are still

772
00:32:09,630 --> 00:32:12,120
compliant and then we can can we go life

773
00:32:12,120 --> 00:32:14,360
right hope that answers your question

774
00:32:14,360 --> 00:32:17,090
yeah it does it's terrific

775
00:32:17,090 --> 00:32:19,860
so I'm looking I don't see any other

776
00:32:19,860 --> 00:32:22,920
questions from the audience this point

777
00:32:22,920 --> 00:32:26,970
so want to say thank you again really do

778
00:32:26,970 --> 00:32:29,100
the time it was a really fascinating

779
00:32:29,100 --> 00:32:31,350
presentation definitely appreciate it

780
00:32:31,350 --> 00:32:35,580
and thank you for having me yeah thank

781

all right everyone well we're gonna take

783
00:32:41,340 --> 00:32:45,780
a short break here and then we will move

784
00:32:45,780 --> 00:32:49,100
on to our next speaker
