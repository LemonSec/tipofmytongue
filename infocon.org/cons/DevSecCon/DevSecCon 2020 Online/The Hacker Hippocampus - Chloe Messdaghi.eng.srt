1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:02,460
hi everyone my name is Claire Misaki and

2
00:00:02,460 --> 00:00:05,190
you're about to dive into a talk that's

3
00:00:05,190 --> 00:00:08,429
totally gamified and interactive now

4
00:00:08,429 --> 00:00:10,050
there's a way that you can't participate

5
00:00:10,050 --> 00:00:13,139
which is you can either DM me answers

6
00:00:13,139 --> 00:00:15,540
throughout this whole thing they have to

7
00:00:15,540 --> 00:00:18,119
be the correct answers and I may select

8
00:00:18,119 --> 00:00:20,189
more than one winner

9
00:00:20,189 --> 00:00:23,250
to get a one month free subscription to

10
00:00:23,250 --> 00:00:26,039
escalate which is the gamified platform

11
00:00:26,039 --> 00:00:29,490
that point three provides that many of

12
00:00:29,490 --> 00:00:31,830
you maybe have participated CTFs so

13
00:00:31,830 --> 00:00:35,190
let's keep going on this shall we so if

14
00:00:35,190 --> 00:00:37,050
you don't know who I am I'm the VP of

15
00:00:37,050 --> 00:00:38,640
strategy over at point three security

16
00:00:38,640 --> 00:00:40,860
I'm also an ethical hacker advocate for

17
00:00:40,860 --> 00:00:43,020
those that don't are like what is that

18
00:00:43,020 --> 00:00:44,910
there is I just kind of look around the

19
00:00:44,910 --> 00:00:46,800
field and I'm like what can be changed

20
00:00:46,800 --> 00:00:49,170
how can we make it better and then I do

21
00:00:49,170 --> 00:00:51,780
whatever it takes to get there

22
00:00:51,780 --> 00:00:53,820
whenever not doing that I'm also the

23
00:00:53,820 --> 00:00:55,649
president and co-founder of row SEC

24
00:00:55,649 --> 00:00:57,870
womenõs security I believe you have two

25
00:00:57,870 --> 00:01:00,239
speakers on here at some point that are

26
00:01:00,239 --> 00:01:03,960
from O SEC so Tanya Shire and Alyssa

27
00:01:03,960 --> 00:01:06,810
Miller I'm also the founder of women

28
00:01:06,810 --> 00:01:11,670
hackers which is a virtual a virtual

29
00:01:11,670 --> 00:01:14,430
platform were non-binary and women

30
00:01:14,430 --> 00:01:16,740
hackers at all levels come together

31
00:01:16,740 --> 00:01:18,930
around the world and we do workshops

32
00:01:18,930 --> 00:01:21,180
ETFs and so on but it's a good place for

33
00:01:21,180 --> 00:01:22,560
us to kind of connect with each other

34
00:01:22,560 --> 00:01:24,720
and have a safe space

35
00:01:24,720 --> 00:01:26,580
I'm also the hacker book club organizer

36
00:01:26,580 --> 00:01:28,890
basically we meet every Tuesday at 5

37
00:01:28,890 --> 00:01:32,369
p.m. Pacific time and every month we

38
00:01:32,369 --> 00:01:33,930
read a new book and it's usually written

39
00:01:33,930 --> 00:01:37,110
by a hacker in the community and hacker

40
00:01:37,110 --> 00:01:39,360
Kimmie reads the book together and yes

41
00:01:39,360 --> 00:01:41,310
the author does a 10 and sometimes those

42
00:01:41,310 --> 00:01:42,960
are mentioned in the book are also in

43
00:01:42,960 --> 00:01:46,229
attendance I'm also a podcaster for itsp

44
00:01:46,229 --> 00:01:48,329
magazines the uncommon journey with Phil

45
00:01:48,329 --> 00:01:52,110
Wiley and Alyssa Miller and last not

46
00:01:52,110 --> 00:01:54,390
least that is my website below and then

47
00:01:54,390 --> 00:01:56,399
my Twitter and Instagram is exactly same

48
00:01:56,399 --> 00:01:58,500
feel free to follow I'm always down for

49
00:01:58,500 --> 00:02:01,439
chatting with you guys so if we're going

50
00:02:01,439 --> 00:02:03,119
to cover is a few things we're going to

51
00:02:03,119 --> 00:02:04,950
go to the history of gamification

52
00:02:04,950 --> 00:02:07,320
however parades are stimulated by it and

53
00:02:07,320 --> 00:02:09,840
why gamification helps security teams

54
00:02:09,840 --> 00:02:12,270
and then we'll go how a game of a

55
00:02:12,270 --> 00:02:14,580
Sheena's transform lives and then i'm

56
00:02:14,580 --> 00:02:16,380
going to do some well if you have some

57
00:02:16,380 --> 00:02:17,970
remaining questions for me more than

58
00:02:17,970 --> 00:02:20,970
happy to answer them so what is

59
00:02:20,970 --> 00:02:24,590
gamification so gamification is

60
00:02:24,590 --> 00:02:27,810
basically think of it as games that work

61
00:02:27,810 --> 00:02:30,500
on problem-solving processing speed

62
00:02:30,500 --> 00:02:35,310
attention span and memory and now we're

63
00:02:35,310 --> 00:02:37,260
endemic to the history now this is the

64
00:02:37,260 --> 00:02:40,070
driest part of this entire presentation

65
00:02:40,070 --> 00:02:43,140
I'm giving you a heads up about it but

66
00:02:43,140 --> 00:02:45,780
if you pay attention very closely you

67
00:02:45,780 --> 00:02:50,850
may win something very special so take a

68
00:02:50,850 --> 00:02:53,700
look this wonderful chart this is your

69
00:02:53,700 --> 00:02:55,320
chart of gamification

70
00:02:55,320 --> 00:02:59,400
so in 425 BC deaf games were created to

71
00:02:59,400 --> 00:03:03,810
fight major famine 3100 BC the first

72
00:03:03,810 --> 00:03:07,260
board game was created in Egypt and SNH

73
00:03:07,260 --> 00:03:09,120
Green stamp was the first time ever

74
00:03:09,120 --> 00:03:11,730
markers actually sold stamps to retailer

75
00:03:11,730 --> 00:03:15,330
C's to reward customers and in 1958 the

76
00:03:15,330 --> 00:03:17,550
first video game was actually invented

77
00:03:17,550 --> 00:03:20,730
and Charles Cardo found a consulting

78
00:03:20,730 --> 00:03:22,260
firm called Jima work and it brings

79
00:03:22,260 --> 00:03:25,920
feedback loops found in sports and into

80
00:03:25,920 --> 00:03:28,260
the workplace and led one is create by

81
00:03:28,260 --> 00:03:30,930
Roy trevor Shaw and Essex University it

82
00:03:30,930 --> 00:03:33,090
was the first multi-user virtual world

83
00:03:33,090 --> 00:03:36,240
game now Thomas Malone publishes what

84
00:03:36,240 --> 00:03:38,310
makes things fun to learn a study of

85
00:03:38,310 --> 00:03:40,680
interestingly motivating computer games

86
00:03:40,680 --> 00:03:44,130
and in 1981 the first ever 3d video

87
00:03:44,130 --> 00:03:45,920
games were released

88
00:03:45,920 --> 00:03:48,240
American Airlines actually was the first

89
00:03:48,240 --> 00:03:50,340
Airlines that introduced a first

90
00:03:50,340 --> 00:03:52,200
frequent flyer program called a

91
00:03:52,200 --> 00:03:54,690
Advantage Holiday Inn

92
00:03:54,690 --> 00:03:56,790
saw what American Airlines day was like

93
00:03:56,790 --> 00:03:58,950
why don't we do that with our hotels and

94
00:03:58,950 --> 00:04:00,540
they lost their first hotel loyalty

95
00:04:00,540 --> 00:04:03,000
program National Car Rental was like

96
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:05,550
well why are we doing that with cars so

97
00:04:05,550 --> 00:04:06,810
then we got they launched their first

98
00:04:06,810 --> 00:04:10,620
car rental rewards program now at this

99
00:04:10,620 --> 00:04:12,930
point now 30% of American households

100
00:04:12,930 --> 00:04:16,168
owned an NES a new generation gamers is

101
00:04:16,168 --> 00:04:18,630
now officially born and then Richard

102
00:04:18,630 --> 00:04:21,478
Bartle publishes who plays mus which

103
00:04:21,478 --> 00:04:23,400
divides video game players into four

104
00:04:23,400 --> 00:04:25,950
unique types

105
00:04:25,950 --> 00:04:28,500
and 2002 series gaming initiative forges

106
00:04:28,500 --> 00:04:29,810
the link between the gaming industry

107
00:04:29,810 --> 00:04:33,420
training health education public policy

108
00:04:33,420 --> 00:04:36,210
and 2013 expelling coins the term

109
00:04:36,210 --> 00:04:39,960
gamification in 2007 punchball created

110
00:04:39,960 --> 00:04:41,940
dunder-mifflin infinity a gamified

111
00:04:41,940 --> 00:04:43,800
website for the TV show of the office

112
00:04:43,800 --> 00:04:46,020
and it receives over 8 million page

113
00:04:46,020 --> 00:04:49,890
views in six weeks in 2009 a quest to

114
00:04:49,890 --> 00:04:51,600
learn accepts a class of sixth graders

115
00:04:51,600 --> 00:04:53,640
into a game based learning environment

116
00:04:53,640 --> 00:04:56,970
and 2010 dev hub adds a point system to

117
00:04:56,970 --> 00:04:58,590
its website and increases user

118
00:04:58,590 --> 00:05:02,690
engagement by 70% and by 2010

119
00:05:02,690 --> 00:05:05,130
gamification code holds the first

120
00:05:05,130 --> 00:05:07,110
gamification summit and you won't

121
00:05:07,110 --> 00:05:08,370
believe where what that's actually

122
00:05:08,370 --> 00:05:10,020
probably near it's SF let's be real at

123
00:05:10,020 --> 00:05:13,260
San Francisco and then 2012 45,000

124
00:05:13,260 --> 00:05:14,940
enroll and a professor Kevin were bucks

125
00:05:14,940 --> 00:05:16,530
online gamification course through

126
00:05:16,530 --> 00:05:21,350
Coursera now in 2012 Mozilla open badges

127
00:05:21,350 --> 00:05:24,960
initiative was launched and this was an

128
00:05:24,960 --> 00:05:26,850
open source badges that can be used to

129
00:05:26,850 --> 00:05:31,050
mark accomplishments online in 2012

130
00:05:31,050 --> 00:05:34,020
gartner predicts 70% of the global 2000

131
00:05:34,020 --> 00:05:35,880
elorg ization will have at least one

132
00:05:35,880 --> 00:05:40,680
game affined application by 2014 and in

133
00:05:40,680 --> 00:05:41,490
2014

134
00:05:41,490 --> 00:05:43,080
m2 Research predicts that gamification

135
00:05:43,080 --> 00:05:48,120
will be a 2.8 billion dollar industry by

136
00:05:48,120 --> 00:05:51,930
2016 which is true but guess what I want

137
00:05:51,930 --> 00:05:53,940
way beyond that it's actually supposed

138
00:05:53,940 --> 00:05:56,070
to be about 11 billion dollar industry

139
00:05:56,070 --> 00:06:00,090
by the end of this year now I did tell

140
00:06:00,090 --> 00:06:02,100
you this was the most dry part but this

141
00:06:02,100 --> 00:06:03,510
is the time when you get to participate

142
00:06:03,510 --> 00:06:06,720
so on the platform that you are using to

143
00:06:06,720 --> 00:06:10,020
ask questions or not feel free to give

144
00:06:10,020 --> 00:06:12,810
your answers on there I will keep track

145
00:06:12,810 --> 00:06:16,710

questions correctly you will be

152
00:06:30,090 --> 00:06:33,750
submitted into getting a one month

153
00:06:33,750 --> 00:06:36,480
subscription so let's do this in what

154
00:06:36,480 --> 00:06:38,770
year did the first video game

155
00:06:38,770 --> 00:06:42,490
out I feel like I should have jeopardy

156
00:06:42,490 --> 00:06:44,560
music in the background think next time

157
00:06:44,560 --> 00:06:47,530
I'm gonna do that and what year did the

158
00:06:47,530 --> 00:06:51,759
first video game come out all right next

159
00:06:51,759 --> 00:06:52,650
question

160
00:06:52,650 --> 00:06:55,780
what country invented the first board

161
00:06:55,780 --> 00:07:00,430
game what country invented the first

162
00:07:00,430 --> 00:07:07,479
board game next question and yeah that

163
00:07:07,479 --> 00:07:08,229

frequent-flyer program so what airline

166
00:07:13,750 --> 00:07:15,669
was that you guys they did the first

167
00:07:15,669 --> 00:07:19,930
Rico fighter program that also made you

168
00:07:19,930 --> 00:07:22,300
had a car rental that followed it yeah

169
00:07:22,300 --> 00:07:24,190
the hotel chain that followed it which

170
00:07:24,190 --> 00:07:28,750
airline was it and then who coined the

171
00:07:28,750 --> 00:07:31,539
term gamification now this believe it or

172
00:07:31,539 --> 00:07:33,310
not is always the hardest one for

173
00:07:33,310 --> 00:07:37,229
someone to find out what the answer is

174
00:07:38,879 --> 00:07:41,949
all right and what was the gamified

175
00:07:41,949 --> 00:07:45,039
website by punch ball for the TV show of

176
00:07:45,039 --> 00:07:51,159
the office called what was the game of

177
00:07:51,159 --> 00:07:53,319
fire website by bunch of all for the TV

178
00:07:53,319 --> 00:07:58,509
show the office cult and then I think

179
00:07:58,509 --> 00:08:01,199
this one is the last question

180
00:08:01,199 --> 00:08:03,279
gamification is expected to become a

181
00:08:03,279 --> 00:08:05,740
blank and billion dollar industry by the

182
00:08:05,740 --> 00:08:11,310
year end of 2020 what is that wonderful

183
00:08:11,310 --> 00:08:17,919
gigantic number all right all right and

184
00:08:17,919 --> 00:08:19,330
a pop quiz

185
00:08:19,330 --> 00:08:22,630
it could be a trick it shall be a

186
00:08:22,630 --> 00:08:24,849
mystery but let's dive back into the

187
00:08:24,849 --> 00:08:25,630
presentation now

188
00:08:25,630 --> 00:08:27,909
and if you guys get what that clip is

189
00:08:27,909 --> 00:08:30,310
from I feel you

190
00:08:30,310 --> 00:08:33,610
we're Monty Python fans all right so

191
00:08:33,610 --> 00:08:36,130
fact is overall info SEC has always been

192
00:08:36,130 --> 00:08:38,708
key if I think about it we have cts we

193
00:08:38,708 --> 00:08:41,140
have bug value we have hackathons and

194
00:08:41,140 --> 00:08:43,690
many of us became hackers because we

195
00:08:43,690 --> 00:08:46,180
want to beat games who want to be better

196
00:08:46,180 --> 00:08:48,550
than our peers because they were better

197
00:08:48,550 --> 00:08:50,470
than us Suspiria they were better than

198
00:08:50,470 --> 00:08:50,970
us

199
00:08:50,970 --> 00:08:52,949
we found ways like cheat codes and other

200
00:08:52,949 --> 00:08:56,279
methods of doing so but most importantly

201
00:08:56,279 --> 00:08:59,160
when we hunt for vulnerabilities it's a

202
00:08:59,160 --> 00:09:01,500
game of how far does a fox hole go is

203
00:09:01,500 --> 00:09:05,519
the constant how can I outsmart this and

204
00:09:05,519 --> 00:09:10,139
that and so yes you get another

205
00:09:10,139 --> 00:09:12,540
wonderful chart and this one's a lot

206
00:09:12,540 --> 00:09:14,910
shorter as you can tell but pay

207
00:09:14,910 --> 00:09:16,730
attention I think you've learned now

208
00:09:16,730 --> 00:09:19,980
October 10 1995 netscape launches the

209
00:09:19,980 --> 00:09:22,709
first-ever cash reward for finding

210
00:09:22,709 --> 00:09:24,810
security bugs and then netscape

211
00:09:24,810 --> 00:09:29,250
navigator 2.0 beta and then the first

212
00:09:29,250 --> 00:09:32,819
DEFCON CTF was in 1996 and then bug

213
00:09:32,819 --> 00:09:34,350
bounty programs were being created and

214
00:09:34,350 --> 00:09:35,610
managed by companies such as Google

215
00:09:35,610 --> 00:09:37,860
Facebook and Mozilla and you were

216
00:09:37,860 --> 00:09:39,569
wondering like why I'm a little confused

217
00:09:39,569 --> 00:09:43,139
on let me explain so companies didn't

218
00:09:43,139 --> 00:09:46,259
have hacker one bucket or cynic and

219
00:09:46,259 --> 00:09:48,300
because they didn't they had to do it

220
00:09:48,300 --> 00:09:51,870
themselves and this was cool for them

221
00:09:51,870 --> 00:09:54,240
but they also learned a lot of lessons

222
00:09:54,240 --> 00:09:57,720
all the way so then you have pond 2l

223
00:09:57,720 --> 00:10:00,509
which door in 2007 and then you have the

224
00:10:00,509 --> 00:10:02,699
birth of the bug many platforms which

225
00:10:02,699 --> 00:10:05,459
changed a lot for us it actually got us

226
00:10:05,459 --> 00:10:07,949
more out there like for example hacked

227
00:10:07,949 --> 00:10:12,149
the Pentagon the army it was because

228
00:10:12,149 --> 00:10:13,829
these bug bounty platforms that people

229
00:10:13,829 --> 00:10:16,680
starting and major enterprises started

230
00:10:16,680 --> 00:10:18,360
trusting the hacker community to help

231
00:10:18,360 --> 00:10:20,370
them find their vulnerabilities and I

232
00:10:20,370 --> 00:10:22,800
started to change slowly Oh what is a

233
00:10:22,800 --> 00:10:25,230
hacker and that's the cool thing about

234
00:10:25,230 --> 00:10:27,569
it all but most importantly it also

235
00:10:27,569 --> 00:10:30,720
showcase the gamification works and it's

236
00:10:30,720 --> 00:10:35,089
what it's what drives humans rewards

237
00:10:35,089 --> 00:10:39,569
just like dollars we like our trees 2014

238
00:10:39,569 --> 00:10:41,579
to today gamma funding has been training

239
00:10:41,579 --> 00:10:44,809
on the rise and we see that everywhere

240
00:10:44,809 --> 00:10:49,769
and it's back and then around a pop quiz

241
00:10:49,769 --> 00:10:54,540
time now remember either Dan or put in

242
00:10:54,540 --> 00:10:56,910
whatever area that you want to you on

243
00:10:56,910 --> 00:10:58,819
the platform on your answer

244
00:10:58,819 --> 00:11:01,139
the first bike banding program was

245
00:11:01,139 --> 00:11:08,790
created in what year when was the first

246
00:11:08,790 --> 00:11:11,730
CTF at DEFCON and when was I mean the

247
00:11:11,730 --> 00:11:14,279
year what year was the first CTF at

248
00:11:14,279 --> 00:11:21,569
DEFCON alright is it for the pop quiz

249
00:11:21,569 --> 00:11:24,839
time but now we get to dive into my

250
00:11:24,839 --> 00:11:27,149
favorite part before I got into InfoSec

251
00:11:27,149 --> 00:11:30,089
I was obsessed with the brain in every

252
00:11:30,089 --> 00:11:34,410
single fair so we're gonna dive into how

253
00:11:34,410 --> 00:11:36,920
our brains are actually simulated by it

254
00:11:36,920 --> 00:11:39,209
so we're going to get to know your brain

255
00:11:39,209 --> 00:11:41,369
but the area that I want you to focus on

256
00:11:41,369 --> 00:11:43,529
is that green section right there called

257
00:11:43,529 --> 00:11:46,170
the temporal lobe on the left side then

258
00:11:46,170 --> 00:11:49,529
we're gonna dive into the other side of

259
00:11:49,529 --> 00:11:51,299
the brain you see there that may dylan

260
00:11:51,299 --> 00:11:52,889
hippocampus because those are the two

261
00:11:52,889 --> 00:11:55,019
main players when it comes to having

262
00:11:55,019 --> 00:11:57,269
gamified now the thing you should note

263
00:11:57,269 --> 00:12:02,189
about is that all these questions that I

264
00:12:02,189 --> 00:12:05,610
covered that pop quiz given you short

265
00:12:05,610 --> 00:12:07,799
response time from learning something

266
00:12:07,799 --> 00:12:11,850
very brand-new that was all to stimulate

267
00:12:11,850 --> 00:12:14,100
your temporal lobe so all this pop quiz

268
00:12:14,100 --> 00:12:17,249
questions were instant wanting to find

269
00:12:17,249 --> 00:12:19,259
out if you collected any information or

270
00:12:19,259 --> 00:12:21,449
data and the temporal lobe does I so

271
00:12:21,449 --> 00:12:23,610
what the temporal lobe does is that it

272
00:12:23,610 --> 00:12:27,240
actually takes the the part of your

273
00:12:27,240 --> 00:12:31,379
brain where you actually I'd you have

274
00:12:31,379 --> 00:12:33,990
your short-term memories and it gets put

275
00:12:33,990 --> 00:12:35,819
into your brain so then it becomes

276
00:12:35,819 --> 00:12:38,220
something long-term so the thing is that

277
00:12:38,220 --> 00:12:40,049
the hippocampus is a part of the

278
00:12:40,049 --> 00:12:43,319
temporal lobe that plays a major role

279
00:12:43,319 --> 00:12:50,189
there the other thing to note about it's

280
00:12:50,189 --> 00:12:52,499
also where you process sensory input

281
00:12:52,499 --> 00:12:54,089
into derived meanings for the

282
00:12:54,089 --> 00:12:56,369
appropriate retention of your visual

283
00:12:56,369 --> 00:12:58,559
memory your language comprehension and

284
00:12:58,559 --> 00:13:00,929
your emotion Association this is where a

285
00:13:00,929 --> 00:13:02,759
gamification thrives and that's where

286
00:13:02,759 --> 00:13:05,639
the amygdala and hippocampus are so

287
00:13:05,639 --> 00:13:07,709
we're gonna do another activity I'm

288
00:13:07,709 --> 00:13:10,690
gonna say some things out loud

289
00:13:10,690 --> 00:13:13,300
and you're gonna fill in the blank no

290
00:13:13,300 --> 00:13:14,950
these are not the ones that you tweet at

291
00:13:14,950 --> 00:13:17,590
me and DM or put on there this is for

292
00:13:17,590 --> 00:13:19,360
you to do at your own home and you go

293
00:13:19,360 --> 00:13:20,920
wake up your neighbors or wake up your

294
00:13:20,920 --> 00:13:22,870
home I don't know what time it is there

295
00:13:22,870 --> 00:13:25,060
but I'm assuming it's either in the

296
00:13:25,060 --> 00:13:26,590
middle night or first thing in the

297
00:13:26,590 --> 00:13:27,040
morning

298
00:13:27,040 --> 00:13:30,220
so let's scare our neighbors shall we so

299
00:13:30,220 --> 00:13:32,080
shout out the answers after I give a

300
00:13:32,080 --> 00:13:34,110
description here we go

301
00:13:34,110 --> 00:13:37,810
what is a plant having permanently woody

302
00:13:37,810 --> 00:13:40,360
main stem that usually is growing to a

303
00:13:40,360 --> 00:13:42,850
high height and developing branches at

304
00:13:42,850 --> 00:13:47,860
the same distance from the ground what

305
00:13:47,860 --> 00:13:52,750
is that it's a tree another one the

306
00:13:52,750 --> 00:13:55,090
nutritious orange to yellow root of a

307
00:13:55,090 --> 00:13:58,450
plant of the parsley family what is it

308
00:13:58,450 --> 00:13:59,790
you guys

309
00:13:59,790 --> 00:14:04,360
carrot an article Roger consisting of a

310
00:14:04,360 --> 00:14:08,520
flat top support on one or more legs a

311
00:14:08,520 --> 00:14:12,910
table so you're kind of seeing here I

312
00:14:12,910 --> 00:14:14,470
can keep going through there's a few

313
00:14:14,470 --> 00:14:16,930
more here but the thing to note about is

314
00:14:16,930 --> 00:14:19,360
that wood the temporal lobe itself I'm

315
00:14:19,360 --> 00:14:22,000
reading I am reading out a description

316
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:24,130
of something and it's connecting to an

317
00:14:24,130 --> 00:14:26,290
image in your brain so that's what the

318
00:14:26,290 --> 00:14:28,690
temporal lobe does it takes whatever

319
00:14:28,690 --> 00:14:31,060
you're hearing and it makes it into a

320
00:14:31,060 --> 00:14:34,960
picture so all the descriptions adds an

321
00:14:34,960 --> 00:14:36,970
image to your brain you registered the

322
00:14:36,970 --> 00:14:39,340
image and then you're able to figure out

323
00:14:39,340 --> 00:14:44,080
what it is now let's dive into the next

324
00:14:44,080 --> 00:14:47,740
one so overall this entire slide this is

325
00:14:47,740 --> 00:14:48,850
going to be the most important thing

326
00:14:48,850 --> 00:14:50,620
when it comes to gamification you're

327
00:14:50,620 --> 00:14:53,200
MacDill an hippocampus the amygdala does

328
00:14:53,200 --> 00:14:55,030
control your emotional response and

329
00:14:55,030 --> 00:14:57,280
helps your brain store memories this is

330
00:14:57,280 --> 00:15:01,180
why for example an F you ever heard this

331
00:15:01,180 --> 00:15:03,790
term but amygdala hijack it happens when

332
00:15:03,790 --> 00:15:06,760
you're in a very high-stress situation

333
00:15:06,760 --> 00:15:08,470
so say for example you get a car

334
00:15:08,470 --> 00:15:10,680
accident who's been a car accident okay

335
00:15:10,680 --> 00:15:13,270
so if you've been in a car accident what

336
00:15:13,270 --> 00:15:15,280
happens is is that everything can slow

337
00:15:15,280 --> 00:15:16,250
down

338
00:15:16,250 --> 00:15:18,140
seems like like everything is going so

339
00:15:18,140 --> 00:15:20,000
slow but I thought my was actually

340
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:22,310
growing really really fast so what is

341
00:15:22,310 --> 00:15:24,800
happening in that moment is that you're

342
00:15:24,800 --> 00:15:27,350
not able to think about anything really

343
00:15:27,350 --> 00:15:29,990
but what you're being able to notice is

344
00:15:29,990 --> 00:15:32,780
that in that moment you feel like you

345
00:15:32,780 --> 00:15:36,530
don't like your entire brain is focused

346
00:15:36,530 --> 00:15:39,410
on that one thing so that's what can

347
00:15:39,410 --> 00:15:40,760
happen when you have something that's

348
00:15:40,760 --> 00:15:44,120
highly stimulating this can happen and

349
00:15:44,120 --> 00:15:46,520
the other issue to note about an

350
00:15:46,520 --> 00:15:49,010
amygdala hijack is that your prefrontal

351
00:15:49,010 --> 00:15:50,870
cortex of your brain the front part of

352
00:15:50,870 --> 00:15:52,940
your brain is the CEO of event a mix of

353
00:15:52,940 --> 00:15:55,070
decisions the amygdala is completely

354
00:15:55,070 --> 00:15:57,500
subconscious so the only time that

355
00:15:57,500 --> 00:16:00,530
registers a fear or a flight mechanism

356
00:16:00,530 --> 00:16:03,950
is when you're actually like consciously

357
00:16:03,950 --> 00:16:06,560
aware and processing the information so

358
00:16:06,560 --> 00:16:09,980
remember amygdala is subconscious hasn't

359
00:16:09,980 --> 00:16:12,200
known the hippocampus is in another

360
00:16:12,200 --> 00:16:14,660
situation like that so their prefrontal

361
00:16:14,660 --> 00:16:15,800
cortex of your brain that you're

362
00:16:15,800 --> 00:16:17,440
actually fully aware of what's going on

363
00:16:17,440 --> 00:16:19,970
all right so let's go dive into the

364
00:16:19,970 --> 00:16:22,100
hippocampus which is works very close to

365
00:16:22,100 --> 00:16:23,839
your role in memory navigation emotional

366
00:16:23,839 --> 00:16:24,370
response

367
00:16:24,370 --> 00:16:27,200
so overall the hippocampus what it does

368
00:16:27,200 --> 00:16:28,640
it takes short-term memories in the

369
00:16:28,640 --> 00:16:31,010
hippocampus and then transfers your

370
00:16:31,010 --> 00:16:32,900
long-term memories and the temporal lobe

371
00:16:32,900 --> 00:16:36,110
our conscious memories aren't formed by

372
00:16:36,110 --> 00:16:39,170
the hippocampus taking a snapshot of the

373
00:16:39,170 --> 00:16:41,690
short-term working memory and community

374
00:16:41,690 --> 00:16:44,180
long-term memory stored in the temporal

375
00:16:44,180 --> 00:16:49,940
lobes so we're gonna do a quick activity

376
00:16:49,940 --> 00:16:52,910
and if you hear my dogs in the

377
00:16:52,910 --> 00:16:54,950
background I'm sorry they decided to

378
00:16:54,950 --> 00:16:58,910
wake up and play in the other room so

379
00:16:58,910 --> 00:17:00,440
what I want you to do is to look at this

380
00:17:00,440 --> 00:17:03,830
list read it thoroughly twice to

381
00:17:03,830 --> 00:17:04,459
yourself

382
00:17:04,459 --> 00:17:08,660
and keep an eye on the order as well now

383
00:17:08,660 --> 00:17:19,339
I'll wait here for a little bit okay I

384
00:17:19,339 --> 00:17:21,410
think you've run it through twice now at

385
00:17:21,410 --> 00:17:23,510
this point

386
00:17:23,510 --> 00:17:26,000
so this is the next step I want you to

387
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:29,330
open a email or pull up notes or

388
00:17:29,330 --> 00:17:31,400
anything that you can write down even if

389
00:17:31,400 --> 00:17:33,200
you're old school with a piece of paper

390
00:17:33,200 --> 00:17:36,710
and a pen that works perfectly fine too

391
00:17:36,710 --> 00:17:38,270
and by the way if you're that type of

392
00:17:38,270 --> 00:17:41,780
person I love you because that is how I

393
00:17:41,780 --> 00:17:44,950
do my things is the only
