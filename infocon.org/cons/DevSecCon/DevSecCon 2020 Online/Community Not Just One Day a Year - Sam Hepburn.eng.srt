7
00:00:12,120 --> 00:00:13,349
already seen you on the stream at some

8
00:00:13,349 --> 00:00:15,630
points during today and but if you don't

9
00:00:15,630 --> 00:00:17,850
know who I am my name is Sam and I'm

10
00:00:17,850 --> 00:00:19,619
actually community manager at snake I

11
00:00:19,619 --> 00:00:21,960
work with a number of other wonderful

12
00:00:21,960 --> 00:00:23,939
humans to make this conference happen as

13
00:00:23,939 --> 00:00:25,230
well as with behind the scenes on the

14
00:00:25,230 --> 00:00:27,630
magnetic ops community and the secure

15
00:00:27,630 --> 00:00:29,910
developer I'm really excited to talk to

16
00:00:29,910 --> 00:00:32,790
you today about sort of community and

17
00:00:32,790 --> 00:00:34,829
yes the rumors are true being a part of

18
00:00:34,829 --> 00:00:36,719
a community is absolutely amazing it

19
00:00:36,719 --> 00:00:38,600
helps with your personal growth and

20
00:00:38,600 --> 00:00:40,620
allows you to talk about the companies

21
00:00:40,620 --> 00:00:41,910
you work with if you're selling products

22
00:00:41,910 --> 00:00:43,680
or services as well as to grow those

23
00:00:43,680 --> 00:00:45,629
teams so you know community can really

24
00:00:45,629 --> 00:00:47,190
doesn't answer for everything

25
00:00:47,190 --> 00:00:50,030
I'm definitely a community junkie and

26
00:00:50,030 --> 00:00:52,289
you all care today so you must have

27
00:00:52,289 --> 00:00:53,640
understood a little bit about the power

28
00:00:53,640 --> 00:00:55,829
of community and or not you just drunk

29
00:00:55,829 --> 00:00:56,940
the kool-aid and you're waiting to see

30
00:00:56,940 --> 00:00:58,649
what happens well hopefully after these

31
00:00:58,649 --> 00:01:00,780
next five minutes and you'll change your

32
00:01:00,780 --> 00:01:03,359
mind so I am going to say the next five

33
00:01:03,359 --> 00:01:04,949
minutes telling you about the amazing

34
00:01:04,949 --> 00:01:06,830
things community can do and while how to

35
00:01:06,830 --> 00:01:10,680
unlock their superpowers and so some of

36
00:01:10,680 --> 00:01:12,630
you might have realized there being a

37
00:01:12,630 --> 00:01:16,049
great developer or security person arts

38
00:01:16,049 --> 00:01:17,250
is just not enough anymore

39
00:01:17,250 --> 00:01:18,450
if you want to advance in your career

40
00:01:18,450 --> 00:01:20,250
you need to be blogging speaking of

41
00:01:20,250 --> 00:01:22,229
conferences engaging in social media

42
00:01:22,229 --> 00:01:24,060
committing to open source and then this

43
00:01:24,060 --> 00:01:26,640
goes on it can actually feel really

44
00:01:26,640 --> 00:01:28,110
daunting and overwhelming and you're

45
00:01:28,110 --> 00:01:30,570
probably thinking to yourself why why is

46
00:01:30,570 --> 00:01:32,700
my technical ability not enough well

47
00:01:32,700 --> 00:01:34,229
they're really short answer is is a lot

48
00:01:34,229 --> 00:01:35,700
of the time the people making decisions

49
00:01:35,700 --> 00:01:37,890
a batch of careers actually never see

50
00:01:37,890 --> 00:01:40,049
your code and and you need to ensure

51
00:01:40,049 --> 00:01:41,610
that those people are seeing your name

52
00:01:41,610 --> 00:01:45,270
and and your work in other places so

53
00:01:45,270 --> 00:01:46,950
don't worry and don't panic there is a

54
00:01:46,950 --> 00:01:49,259
silver lining and are talking through

55
00:01:49,259 --> 00:01:52,009
the few and how a community can help

56
00:01:52,009 --> 00:01:54,000
first things first if you're looking to

57
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:55,500
you and grow your speaking career

58
00:01:55,500 --> 00:01:57,290
communities are amazing for that and

59
00:01:57,290 --> 00:01:59,340
obviously staying at some amazing

60
00:01:59,340 --> 00:02:02,250
speakers all 24 hours you're almost 22

61
00:02:02,250 --> 00:02:04,799
hours mark I think and as one of the be

62
00:02:04,799 --> 00:02:06,119
magnetic ops community we're always

63
00:02:06,119 --> 00:02:07,290
looking for great speakers you have the

64
00:02:07,290 --> 00:02:08,848
poke and call the papers and a lot of

65
00:02:08,848 --> 00:02:10,560
other communities really are looking for

00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:12,870
people to get involved so please have

67
00:02:12,870 --> 00:02:13,620
good submit

68
00:02:13,620 --> 00:02:15,750
that's if the idea of standing in front

69
00:02:15,750 --> 00:02:17,670
of a stage in front of ten fifty you

70
00:02:17,670 --> 00:02:19,260
know hundred people or virtually in

71
00:02:19,260 --> 00:02:21,299
front of thousands puts you into a panic

72
00:02:21,299 --> 00:02:23,190
attack then please don't do it there are

73
00:02:23,190 --> 00:02:25,260
other ways to get involved but if you're

74
00:02:25,260 --> 00:02:26,640
just nervous and you're thinking like a

75
00:02:26,640 --> 00:02:28,680
lot of people say I just don't know what

76
00:02:28,680 --> 00:02:30,450
I would talk about then a community can

77
00:02:30,450 --> 00:02:32,519
definitely help and please reach out to

78
00:02:32,519 --> 00:02:33,959
me on slack I'm happy to work with you

79
00:02:33,959 --> 00:02:35,430
on this we run speaker clinics and a

80
00:02:35,430 --> 00:02:37,260
whole bunch of other things to try get

81
00:02:37,260 --> 00:02:38,730
you involved and start up small you know

82
00:02:38,730 --> 00:02:40,440
present your team and then move to maybe

83
00:02:40,440 --> 00:02:42,000
a meet-up and then on to a conference

84
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:45,329
and the next way we can look at how

85
00:02:45,329 --> 00:02:46,829
community involve is actually your

86
00:02:46,829 --> 00:02:48,629
personal developments you've all learned

87
00:02:48,629 --> 00:02:52,500
an amazing amount today and but a lot of

88
00:02:52,500 --> 00:02:53,879
time you know the see technology is

89
00:02:53,879 --> 00:02:56,040
moving so fast there to wait for a book

90
00:02:56,040 --> 00:02:58,109
to be published sometimes it's just too

91
00:02:58,109 --> 00:03:00,060
long to wait but a lot of those people

92
00:03:00,060 --> 00:03:02,970
researching those ideas or sharing that

93
00:03:02,970 --> 00:03:06,780
content and community events and I think

94
00:03:06,780 --> 00:03:09,359
I just lost the slide program and at

95
00:03:09,359 --> 00:03:11,310
community events and so being able to

96
00:03:11,310 --> 00:03:14,480
engage with the community allows you to

97
00:03:14,480 --> 00:03:16,709
see their content living off of it but

98
00:03:16,709 --> 00:03:19,380
I'm back but also never underestimate

99
00:03:19,380 --> 00:03:20,970
the people sitting right next to you or

100
00:03:20,970 --> 00:03:22,620
in this case virtually you know there

101
00:03:22,620 --> 00:03:24,090
are some great speakers don't get me

102
00:03:24,090 --> 00:03:25,260
wrong and we learned a lot today

103
00:03:25,260 --> 00:03:27,389
but I'm sure you have valuable insights

104
00:03:27,389 --> 00:03:28,650
to some of the content that the shape

105
00:03:28,650 --> 00:03:30,540
and so do the people next to you so

106
00:03:30,540 --> 00:03:32,959
please jump onto our select community

107
00:03:32,959 --> 00:03:37,079
sorry or checks the people and they may

108
00:03:37,079 --> 00:03:39,569
have the answers you're looking for the

109
00:03:39,569 --> 00:03:41,280
other reason why it's really great to

110
00:03:41,280 --> 00:03:43,440
talk to people next to you is I was

111
00:03:43,440 --> 00:03:44,940
actually looking at the virtual platform

112
00:03:44,940 --> 00:03:46,709
winner and a number of you said that you

113
00:03:46,709 --> 00:03:48,810
were here to potentially find a new role

114
00:03:48,810 --> 00:03:51,120
well I'm sure I can speak for every

115
00:03:51,120 --> 00:03:52,410
hiring manager that was listening right

116
00:03:52,410 --> 00:03:54,449
now if you could avoid looking through

117
00:03:54,449 --> 00:03:56,190
you know hundreds of thousands TVs to

118
00:03:56,190 --> 00:03:57,540
find someone that fitted in with your

119
00:03:57,540 --> 00:04:00,299
team and have the skills you'd rather do

120
00:04:00,299 --> 00:04:03,329
that no one likes to hire and so you

121
00:04:03,329 --> 00:04:04,620
need to be able to interact with these

122
00:04:04,620 --> 00:04:06,660
people and communities again an amazing

123
00:04:06,660 --> 00:04:07,379
place to do it

124
00:04:07,379 --> 00:04:09,239
the other reason why it's great is

125
00:04:09,239 --> 00:04:10,709
you're not in an interview process so

126
00:04:10,709 --> 00:04:12,959
people have their guard down and so

127
00:04:12,959 --> 00:04:14,549
they're willing to really tell you what

128
00:04:14,549 --> 00:04:16,228
it's like to work at the company rather

129
00:04:16,228 --> 00:04:17,899
than they're sort of like candy-coated

130
00:04:17,899 --> 00:04:19,949
interview process for you to find out

131
00:04:19,949 --> 00:04:21,899
that the environment is just not for you

132
00:04:21,899 --> 00:04:23,520
it's not that the company operates just

133
00:04:23,520 --> 00:04:25,349
you know everyone's got an individual

134
00:04:25,349 --> 00:04:26,700
thing when they're looking for different

135
00:04:26,700 --> 00:04:27,540
roles and there's

136
00:04:27,540 --> 00:04:28,530
she circles back to my original

137
00:04:28,530 --> 00:04:30,570
statement on the people that are making

138
00:04:30,570 --> 00:04:32,370
decisions about your career don't always

139
00:04:32,370 --> 00:04:35,280
actually see your technical ability so

140
00:04:35,280 --> 00:04:36,510
now that I've sold your own community

141
00:04:36,510 --> 00:04:37,650
and you think you know what Sam how do I

142
00:04:37,650 --> 00:04:39,600
get involved other than today other than

143
00:04:39,600 --> 00:04:41,280
this great 24-hour event you want to

144
00:04:41,280 --> 00:04:43,710
keep engaging and what I'm gonna tell

145
00:04:43,710 --> 00:04:45,960
you where to go so there's a number of

146
00:04:45,960 --> 00:04:47,400
different communities out there and

147
00:04:47,400 --> 00:04:49,440
obviously if you go onto meetup calm you

148
00:04:49,440 --> 00:04:51,270
can find a community for everything that

149
00:04:51,270 --> 00:04:52,920
the Oster community even some of our

150
00:04:52,920 --> 00:04:55,290
speakers today had great communities I'm

151
00:04:55,290 --> 00:04:57,720
obviously biased and I want you to join

152
00:04:57,720 --> 00:05:00,270
in my dating ops community you can go

153
00:05:00,270 --> 00:05:02,190
across to my lipstick Aqsa oh you'll be

154
00:05:02,190 --> 00:05:04,050
able to find links to the slack

155
00:05:04,050 --> 00:05:05,160
community that some of you already

156
00:05:05,160 --> 00:05:07,590
involved in as well as all our previous

157
00:05:07,590 --> 00:05:09,300
content a lot of speakers that were on

158
00:05:09,300 --> 00:05:10,470
our sessions today have done the

159
00:05:10,470 --> 00:05:13,260
sessions as well we have a podcast that

160
00:05:13,260 --> 00:05:15,540
comes out once a week and actually I

161
00:05:15,540 --> 00:05:17,250
decided to keep this week's one until

162
00:05:17,250 --> 00:05:18,600
after this session so I'm going to don't

163
00:05:18,600 --> 00:05:20,580
hit publish now so their contents just

164
00:05:20,580 --> 00:05:24,030
so you guys and please hop on another

165
00:05:24,030 --> 00:05:25,620
reason why I love the Madison ops

166

community other than because I run this

167
00:05:27,030 --> 00:05:29,010
is that we were originally always

168
00:05:29,010 --> 00:05:31,260
virtual so it's not a covert 19 and

169
00:05:31,260 --> 00:05:33,060
pandemic reason and the reason why we

170
00:05:33,060 --> 00:05:34,800
did that was one to be accessible to all

171
00:05:34,800 --> 00:05:36,780
of you so we have your in the world if

172
00:05:36,780 --> 00:05:38,700
you don't have a local meetup group to

173
00:05:38,700 --> 00:05:40,290
go to or you can't get there because you

174
00:05:40,290 --> 00:05:42,390
have kid rounds or work late or whatever

175
00:05:42,390 --> 00:05:44,790
it may be and our content we try to make

176
00:05:44,790 --> 00:05:46,890
and accessible as one of our speakers we

177
00:05:46,890 --> 00:05:48,120
don't need to wait for them to come into

178
00:05:48,120 --> 00:05:50,130
our local area in order to access such

179
00:05:50,130 --> 00:05:53,490
great content and so again might be

180
00:05:53,490 --> 00:05:58,050
selfish but I say join us and we have as

181
00:05:58,050 --> 00:05:59,640
I said we've got the community we've got

182
00:05:59,640 --> 00:06:00,570
the conference and they've got the

183
00:06:00,570 --> 00:06:02,370
podcast and we'll always have different

184
00:06:02,370 --> 00:06:04,230
content coming out so please pop onto

185
00:06:04,230 --> 00:06:05,970
select say hi I'm Sam on slack and I'm

186
00:06:05,970 --> 00:06:09,180
FM have been on Twitter and just really

187
00:06:09,180 --> 00:06:10,980
say hi and hopefully I've convinced you

188
00:06:10,980 --> 00:06:13,080
to get involved over and above the

189
00:06:13,080 --> 00:06:17,810
24-hour event and thank you
