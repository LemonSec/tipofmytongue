1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:02,070
yeah so I'm ashtin Road nicer mines I'd

2
00:00:02,070 --> 00:00:05,279
creative doodling with purpose I really

3
00:00:05,279 --> 00:00:07,140
want to encourage you to pick up the pen

4
00:00:07,140 --> 00:00:09,210
so let's talk about it why would why

5
00:00:09,210 --> 00:00:11,340
would you do this in the first place

6
00:00:11,340 --> 00:00:14,219
sky named Allen Fabio created a theory

7
00:00:14,219 --> 00:00:16,680
basically words and pictures help you

8
00:00:16,680 --> 00:00:18,570
connect to interact with knowledge and

9
00:00:18,570 --> 00:00:20,699
solidified into your long-term memory so

10
00:00:20,699 --> 00:00:23,779
having those two together make magic

11
00:00:23,779 --> 00:00:26,640
just the sheer fact of doodling like you

12
00:00:26,640 --> 00:00:27,869
know a scribble on a piece of paper

13
00:00:27,869 --> 00:00:30,630
actually helps you stay focused and can

14
00:00:30,630 --> 00:00:32,790
increase your memory retention up to 29%

15
00:00:32,790 --> 00:00:35,010
and my biggest thing that I'm always

16
00:00:35,010 --> 00:00:37,440
challenging people is to look at drawing

17
00:00:37,440 --> 00:00:40,770
as your best thinking tool not as like a

18
00:00:40,770 --> 00:00:42,840
thing that you admire in a gallery and

19
00:00:42,840 --> 00:00:45,149
there's certainly lots of amazing

20
00:00:45,149 --> 00:00:47,820
opportunity to do that but for today and

21
00:00:47,820 --> 00:00:50,129
I hope when you pick up the pen you'll

22
00:00:50,129 --> 00:00:52,199
use it as your best thinking tool use

23
00:00:52,199 --> 00:00:54,539
drawing as an action not as a thing to

24
00:00:54,539 --> 00:00:56,640
admire so we're just gonna quickly go

25
00:00:56,640 --> 00:00:59,190
through some the elements of visual

26
00:00:59,190 --> 00:01:01,590
note-taking or anything around helping

27
00:01:01,590 --> 00:01:03,660
you visualize your ideas for yourself or

28
00:01:03,660 --> 00:01:05,700
your team's on whiteboards or flip

29
00:01:05,700 --> 00:01:08,040
charts so your first one is lettering

30
00:01:08,040 --> 00:01:09,720
lettering is like pretty foundational

31
00:01:09,720 --> 00:01:11,670
you want to have lettering that you can

32
00:01:11,670 --> 00:01:13,530
actually read that's legible there's a

33
00:01:13,530 --> 00:01:16,470
few samples there are some examples the

34
00:01:16,470 --> 00:01:18,330
next one are bullets bullets are really

35
00:01:18,330 --> 00:01:20,070
awesome for helping create that

36
00:01:20,070 --> 00:01:22,650
hierarchy you know show that supporting

37
00:01:22,650 --> 00:01:25,500
details and kind of help create those

38
00:01:25,500 --> 00:01:28,829
lists within whatever you're drawing use

39
00:01:28,829 --> 00:01:31,799
lines lines are awesome to help enclose

40
00:01:31,799 --> 00:01:34,650
separate connect ideas and you can make

41
00:01:34,650 --> 00:01:37,369
them as fancy or as clean as you like

42
00:01:37,369 --> 00:01:40,079
arrows are really amazing for helping

43
00:01:40,079 --> 00:01:42,119
show direction and flow and also help

44
00:01:42,119 --> 00:01:44,850
connect ideas and if you never want to

45
00:01:44,850 --> 00:01:47,340
make a wonky arrow again just follow

46
00:01:47,340 --> 00:01:50,070
this simple formula of connecting the

47
00:01:50,070 --> 00:01:53,240
dots and making your arrow this way and

48
00:01:53,240 --> 00:01:55,950
when you do that you can create the if

49
00:01:55,950 --> 00:01:57,180
you create the body of the air like that

50
00:01:57,180 --> 00:01:58,649
every time then you can give it some

51
00:01:58,649 --> 00:02:01,189
energy and make it any shape you want

52
00:02:01,189 --> 00:02:03,960
boxes are my absolute favorite drawing

53
00:02:03,960 --> 00:02:06,719
element the speech bubble there at the

54
00:02:06,719 --> 00:02:08,038
bottom is probably my number one

55
00:02:08,038 --> 00:02:09,869
favorite and you'll probably see one in

56
00:02:09,869 --> 00:02:12,220
almost every drawing that I do

57
00:02:12,220 --> 00:02:13,600
boxes are really good for helping

58
00:02:13,600 --> 00:02:16,090
separate and close ideas as well or to

59
00:02:16,090 --> 00:02:19,390
highlight information if you want to

60
00:02:19,390 --> 00:02:21,490
upgrade your stick person stick people

61
00:02:21,490 --> 00:02:23,380
are amazing and you should totally draw

62
00:02:23,380 --> 00:02:25,870
them but if you want to upgrade you can

63
00:02:25,870 --> 00:02:27,850
move to a start person so using the arms

64
00:02:27,850 --> 00:02:30,220
and the points of the star as the arms

65
00:02:30,220 --> 00:02:32,100
and the legs and the circle for the top

66
00:02:32,100 --> 00:02:35,110
when you do that you can put the arms

67
00:02:35,110 --> 00:02:36,600
and legs in many different directions

68
00:02:36,600 --> 00:02:39,570
and I go again show energy and

69
00:02:39,570 --> 00:02:43,360
representing people in your drawings are

70
00:02:43,360 --> 00:02:45,070
really important because most of the

71
00:02:45,070 --> 00:02:46,630
time that's what we're talking about is

72
00:02:46,630 --> 00:02:49,960
people in problems and processes if you

73
00:02:49,960 --> 00:02:51,730
really want to make your kind of picture

74
00:02:51,730 --> 00:02:53,800
pop off the page a little bit you can

75
00:02:53,800 --> 00:02:55,390
add a little bit of shadows either gray

76
00:02:55,390 --> 00:02:57,640
or a different color just think about

77
00:02:57,640 --> 00:02:59,590
where your light source is so my light

78
00:02:59,590 --> 00:03:01,210
source is up in the right-hand corner

79
00:03:01,210 --> 00:03:03,790
here so that means that the light is

80
00:03:03,790 --> 00:03:05,950
hitting on that back side and then the

81
00:03:05,950 --> 00:03:07,720
shadow is sort of falling to the left so

82
00:03:07,720 --> 00:03:08,830
there's different ways that you can do

83
00:03:08,830 --> 00:03:10,510
that and the one over there on the left

84
00:03:10,510 --> 00:03:11,980
you can you know color in behind

85
00:03:11,980 --> 00:03:13,450
something to also make it look like it's

86
00:03:13,450 --> 00:03:15,870
popping so just a few tips and tricks

87
00:03:15,870 --> 00:03:19,209
the first one to get started is I highly

88
00:03:19,209 --> 00:03:21,910
encourage people to take their blank

89
00:03:21,910 --> 00:03:24,790
piece of paper and turn it from vertical

90
00:03:24,790 --> 00:03:27,160
to horizontal what we were learning how

91
00:03:27,160 --> 00:03:29,530
to do notes in school or it wishes the

92
00:03:29,530 --> 00:03:31,810
default I guess we just kind of captured

93
00:03:31,810 --> 00:03:33,070
everything in a linear way but are

94
00:03:33,070 --> 00:03:34,420
actually our brains actually think more

95
00:03:34,420 --> 00:03:37,959
spatial so by having your page in a

96
00:03:37,959 --> 00:03:39,610
horizontal fashion it allows you to kind

97
00:03:39,610 --> 00:03:41,770
of connect create and draw those

98
00:03:41,770 --> 00:03:43,840
pictures and and capture that

99
00:03:43,840 --> 00:03:45,370
information so you can think a little

100
00:03:45,370 --> 00:03:46,930
bit more spatially your brain will thank

101
00:03:46,930 --> 00:03:49,800
you for it at the end of the day

102
00:03:49,800 --> 00:03:52,720
functionality is a functioning

103
00:03:52,720 --> 00:03:54,940
functionality over pretty-pretty is

104
00:03:54,940 --> 00:03:58,239
great you can take some of those drawing

105
00:03:58,239 --> 00:03:59,620
elements and practice them and make them

106
00:03:59,620 --> 00:04:01,780
look really great but at the end of the

107
00:04:01,780 --> 00:04:03,310
day like I said it has to be functional

108
00:04:03,310 --> 00:04:04,959
has to be useful for what you're wanting

109
00:04:04,959 --> 00:04:06,940
to do it was for yourself to remember

110
00:04:06,940 --> 00:04:08,200
something or if you're doing it for a

111
00:04:08,200 --> 00:04:10,480
team you want to be able to have that

112
00:04:10,480 --> 00:04:14,350
momentum and use that information the

113
00:04:14,350 --> 00:04:15,880
great thing is when you're drawing

114
00:04:15,880 --> 00:04:17,230
something it really only needs to

115
00:04:17,230 --> 00:04:19,570
represent 30% of reality so you don't

116
00:04:19,570 --> 00:04:22,120
need to take you know an hour or however

117
00:04:22,120 --> 00:04:23,620
long it would take to draw the picture

118
00:04:23,620 --> 00:04:24,750
on the left

119
00:04:24,750 --> 00:04:26,640
the guy on the right which is a

120
00:04:26,640 --> 00:04:28,740
different form of a star person will

121
00:04:28,740 --> 00:04:30,300
totally do the trick you can see that

122
00:04:30,300 --> 00:04:32,210
he's a person he he gets the job done

123
00:04:32,210 --> 00:04:34,650
also at the end of the day content is

124
00:04:34,650 --> 00:04:35,970
king so making sure that you capture

125
00:04:35,970 --> 00:04:38,040
that information and using those simple

126
00:04:38,040 --> 00:04:40,290
drawing tools but having that strong

127
00:04:40,290 --> 00:04:42,780
lettering and capturing the meat or the

128
00:04:42,780 --> 00:04:44,970
the main points of whatever you're

129
00:04:44,970 --> 00:04:47,460
capturing is really awesome too

130
00:04:47,460 --> 00:04:49,200
in terms of sketchnoting or graphic

131
00:04:49,200 --> 00:04:52,170
recording and the amazing thing is that

132
00:04:52,170 --> 00:04:54,060
all you really need to do to get started

133
00:04:54,060 --> 00:04:56,580
is a blank canvas so I highly encourage

134
00:04:56,580 --> 00:04:58,920
you to pick up a pen or if you have a

135
00:04:58,920 --> 00:05:01,020
device that you can draw on your screen

136
00:05:01,020 --> 00:05:04,380
go for it as well and that's it thank

137
00:05:04,380 --> 00:05:06,390
you so much for your time and I did a

138
00:05:06,390 --> 00:05:07,680
little timer and I think I'm right on

139
00:05:07,680 --> 00:05:11,130
time with my 5 minutes please follow me

140

00:05:12,960 --> 00:05:15,750
active it's mostly pictures of graphic

142
00:05:15,750 --> 00:05:18,210
recordings and my kids so if you want to

143

or I want to just chat to me about

147
00:05:26,400 --> 00:05:28,530
drawing or anything feel free to message

148

well dev Satcon is also tweeting out

151
00:05:35,760 --> 00:05:36,780
these pictures so if you want to see

152
00:05:36,780 --> 00:05:38,610
some examples I've had to execute those

153
00:05:38,610 --> 00:05:41,870
are there and you can have a look
