something today

what I've got to share so this is a bit

25
00:01:03,420 --> 00:01:06,659
of an unusual talk at a deficit cops

26
00:01:06,659 --> 00:01:09,720
deficit con event I'm not gonna be

27
00:01:09,720 --> 00:01:11,610
getting into any tactic or any kind of

28
00:01:11,610 --> 00:01:13,770
technical areas when I'm looking at a

29
00:01:13,770 --> 00:01:15,479
really broad sort of strategic level

30
00:01:15,479 --> 00:01:18,060
about some of the personnel that you

31
00:01:18,060 --> 00:01:19,500
might be missing out on some of the

32
00:01:19,500 --> 00:01:21,330
people that could be adding a lot to

33
00:01:21,330 --> 00:01:24,150
your company over the coming weeks and

34
00:01:24,150 --> 00:01:28,500
months so let's see if my slides work

35
00:01:28,500 --> 00:01:32,579
onto slide 2 so yeah bit about me I'm

36
00:01:32,579 --> 00:01:35,880
the founder and CEO of exceptional which

37
00:01:35,880 --> 00:01:37,560
is a technology matching platform

38
00:01:37,560 --> 00:01:39,990
connecting autistic jobseekers with

39
00:01:39,990 --> 00:01:43,470
businesses that need top talent and this

40
00:01:43,470 --> 00:01:45,720
business was really inspired by my

41
00:01:45,720 --> 00:01:48,689
sister Sarah now she is on the autism

42
00:01:48,689 --> 00:01:52,320
spectrum has some amazing strengths is a

43
00:01:52,320 --> 00:01:54,530
real talent when it comes to singing

44
00:01:54,530 --> 00:01:57,329
brilliance of music but I've watched her

45
00:01:57,329 --> 00:01:59,250
for a whole working age she recently

46
00:01:59,250 --> 00:02:01,920
turned a few years ago 40 so she's had

47
00:02:01,920 --> 00:02:04,469
over 20 years of of that period of

48
00:02:04,469 --> 00:02:06,600
working life when she struggled to find

49
00:02:06,600 --> 00:02:09,449
and keep work and there was a moment

50
00:02:09,449 --> 00:02:12,810
about now three years ago when she was

51
00:02:12,810 --> 00:02:13,550
working as a

52
00:02:13,550 --> 00:02:16,790
cleaner and she was through that shift

53
00:02:16,790 --> 00:02:18,860
falling structures very very literally

54
00:02:18,860 --> 00:02:23,330
and yet after that that moment she was

55
00:02:23,330 --> 00:02:25,580
actually let go from that position the

56
00:02:25,580 --> 00:02:27,050
employer didn't take the time to

57
00:02:27,050 --> 00:02:29,240
understand her and understand that she

58
00:02:29,240 --> 00:02:30,890
takes instructions very very literally

59
00:02:30,890 --> 00:02:34,340
and ended up letting her go and that was

60
00:02:34,340 --> 00:02:36,830
really a kind of tipping point for me if

61
00:02:36,830 --> 00:02:38,000
you like I'd seen that happen several

62
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:40,490
times you know in her work and finally I

63
00:02:40,490 --> 00:02:43,160
decided I had enough I wanted to start

64
00:02:43,160 --> 00:02:45,670
company that showed you could really

65
00:02:45,670 --> 00:02:48,110
utilize the strengths of someone like my

66
00:02:48,110 --> 00:02:51,290
sister and deploy them as a business

67
00:02:51,290 --> 00:02:54,080
opportunity if you like and the idea for

68
00:02:54,080 --> 00:02:57,250
exceptional was born out of that moment

69
00:02:57,250 --> 00:02:59,210
so what I'm gonna do is going to tell

70
00:02:59,210 --> 00:03:00,620
you a bit about this talent pool and

71
00:03:00,620 --> 00:03:02,330
then I want give me some specific

72
00:03:02,330 --> 00:03:04,820
examples of people that excelled and

73
00:03:04,820 --> 00:03:06,680
companies that employing in the area and

74
00:03:06,680 --> 00:03:08,090
finally I'm gonna give you some

75
00:03:08,090 --> 00:03:11,540
practical tips of what you can do to

76
00:03:11,540 --> 00:03:15,860
bring about some change so firstly what

77
00:03:15,860 --> 00:03:18,260
is this talent pool well some of the

78
00:03:18,260 --> 00:03:20,570
people in it they come to come to ask

79
00:03:20,570 --> 00:03:21,410
come to me

80
00:03:21,410 --> 00:03:24,500
often have double degrees often in two

81
00:03:24,500 --> 00:03:27,310
different areas in adjacent areas which

82
00:03:27,310 --> 00:03:29,630
makes them quite broad but also in the

83
00:03:29,630 --> 00:03:31,880
area where those two degrees overlap

84
00:03:31,880 --> 00:03:33,739
there's a real niche a new understanding

85
00:03:33,739 --> 00:03:36,560
that's often developed and yet a number

86
00:03:36,560 --> 00:03:38,000
of people that have these double degrees

87
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:41,750
end up working as bus drivers delivering

88
00:03:41,750 --> 00:03:43,430
groceries there's nothing wrong with

89
00:03:43,430 --> 00:03:45,560
that not saying that's not a good career

90
00:03:45,560 --> 00:03:47,330
to have in fact one of the angel

91
00:03:47,330 --> 00:03:49,280
investors of exceptional is a bus driver

92
00:03:49,280 --> 00:03:53,300
as one of his many careers but for these

93
00:03:53,300 --> 00:03:55,220
individuals I'm referring to this was

94
00:03:55,220 --> 00:03:56,690
for them not what they wanted to be

95
00:03:56,690 --> 00:03:58,820
doing and they were not able to get into

96
00:03:58,820 --> 00:04:01,160
the technology jobs that their degrees

97
00:04:01,160 --> 00:04:04,100
were pushing them towards for various

98
00:04:04,100 --> 00:04:07,220
reasons that I will get into so this

99
00:04:07,220 --> 00:04:09,920
pull alongside those the half degrees

100
00:04:09,920 --> 00:04:11,480
and double degrees there's also people

101
00:04:11,480 --> 00:04:14,360
that are self-taught who learned from

102
00:04:14,360 --> 00:04:17,450
home online learning and up to a few

103
00:04:17,450 --> 00:04:19,279
years ago that was really looked down

104
00:04:19,279 --> 00:04:21,019
upon now more more companies are willing

105
00:04:21,019 --> 00:04:24,280
to accept people that are that are

106
00:04:24,280 --> 00:04:26,060
self-taught they've done that sort of

107
00:04:26,060 --> 00:04:27,500
online learning versus

108
00:04:27,500 --> 00:04:30,680
more traditional ways of educating so

109
00:04:30,680 --> 00:04:32,990
things are starting to change for this

110
00:04:32,990 --> 00:04:34,760
group one of the reasons that they

111
00:04:34,760 --> 00:04:36,980
struggle to get in is challenges with

112
00:04:36,980 --> 00:04:39,470
interviewing poor interview technique or

113
00:04:39,470 --> 00:04:43,060
in fact I'm now trying to see it as

114
00:04:43,060 --> 00:04:45,350
deficits from the interviewers who are

115
00:04:45,350 --> 00:04:47,900
not understanding these particular

116
00:04:47,900 --> 00:04:51,140
candidates other stencil they have

117
00:04:51,140 --> 00:04:53,030
include are being really loyal to

118
00:04:53,030 --> 00:04:56,210
employers are being really hyper focused

119
00:04:56,210 --> 00:04:58,880
on solving problems and getting to the

120
00:04:58,880 --> 00:05:00,860
bottom of issues being really really

121
00:05:00,860 --> 00:05:04,010
precise and being amazing at learning

122
00:05:04,010 --> 00:05:07,820
improving themselves as they go and yet

123
00:05:07,820 --> 00:05:10,910
in some cases varies across different

124
00:05:10,910 --> 00:05:13,669
countries but too often there are 12

125
00:05:13,669 --> 00:05:17,660
times less likely to be employed which

126
00:05:17,660 --> 00:05:19,970
is as you can imagine a real big

127
00:05:19,970 --> 00:05:23,570
challenge for them one of the

128
00:05:23,570 --> 00:05:25,160
individuals in this talent pool probably

129
00:05:25,160 --> 00:05:27,710
the most famous is Anthony Hopkins the

130
00:05:27,710 --> 00:05:32,150
actor and he was diagnosed as being on

131
00:05:32,150 --> 00:05:34,700
the autism spectrum in his 70s quite

132
00:05:34,700 --> 00:05:37,190
late in his career and he said that that

133
00:05:37,190 --> 00:05:40,010
actually explained some of the the

134
00:05:40,010 --> 00:05:41,600
interest see some of the ways he was so

135
00:05:41,600 --> 00:05:44,419
good at acting it also under steam

136
00:05:44,419 --> 00:05:45,560
understand some of the ways he goes

137
00:05:45,560 --> 00:05:48,020
about getting deep into the characters

138
00:05:48,020 --> 00:05:52,700
that he understands so this talent pool

139
00:05:52,700 --> 00:05:55,250
that I'm talking about is the group of

140
00:05:55,250 --> 00:05:58,250
people on the autism spectrum autistic

141
00:05:58,250 --> 00:06:01,880
people and according to the CDC in the

142
00:06:01,880 --> 00:06:05,390
u.s. they number 125 million globally

143
00:06:05,390 --> 00:06:08,290
that's based on a prevalence of 1 in 59

144
00:06:08,290 --> 00:06:11,000
although other countries vary slightly

145
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:13,640
they're often around that mark so we may

146
00:06:13,640 --> 00:06:15,050
find it might be slightly more slightly

147
00:06:15,050 --> 00:06:17,660
less as the years go on but it does seem

148
00:06:17,660 --> 00:06:20,300
to be as we deepen our understanding of

149
00:06:20,300 --> 00:06:23,000
autistic people and the condition then

150
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:25,810
actually the number seems to be going up

151
00:06:25,810 --> 00:06:28,400
in Australia where we're based they're

152
00:06:28,400 --> 00:06:32,210
around 350,000 people 76 million across

153
00:06:32,210 --> 00:06:35,060
Asia the UK autistic society then

154
00:06:35,060 --> 00:06:36,979
assessment of their members and they

155
00:06:36,979 --> 00:06:39,200
deduced around 10 percent have an

156
00:06:39,200 --> 00:06:41,420
interest in or skills for

157
00:06:41,420 --> 00:06:43,820
the tech industry so we take that broad

158
00:06:43,820 --> 00:06:47,030
number as being the group that we're

159
00:06:47,030 --> 00:06:48,620
focusing on although we're just

160
00:06:48,620 --> 00:06:50,930
beginning to step outside of beyond

161
00:06:50,930 --> 00:06:53,000
placing people purely in tech roles into

162
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:55,730
other areas as well and so if you take

163
00:06:55,730 --> 00:06:57,950
that 10 percent figure apply it 225

164
00:06:57,950 --> 00:07:00,110
million you get 12 and a half million

165
00:07:00,110 --> 00:07:03,680
and then that's all people so just under

166
00:07:03,680 --> 00:07:06,410
half of working age is a very very poor

167
00:07:06,410 --> 00:07:08,660
tightest except I on a global level but

168
00:07:08,660 --> 00:07:10,610
it gives you an approximate picture they

169
00:07:10,610 --> 00:07:13,730
were talking around 6 million people on

170
00:07:13,730 --> 00:07:17,270
the other hand I constantly hear for

171
00:07:17,270 --> 00:07:19,880
people in the security world that's

172
00:07:19,880 --> 00:07:21,950
there's a gap in talent there's

173
00:07:21,950 --> 00:07:24,200
disagreements about how much and you

174
00:07:24,200 --> 00:07:26,300
know when that agree when that gap is

175
00:07:26,300 --> 00:07:28,760
kind of peaking you know I just heard a

176
00:07:28,760 --> 00:07:31,640
recent report from one firm analyzing

177
00:07:31,640 --> 00:07:33,110
leaders across the tech industry that

178
00:07:33,110 --> 00:07:35,570
said 78% of leaders say that they can't

179
00:07:35,570 --> 00:07:38,380
find enough people in the security field

180
00:07:38,380 --> 00:07:42,050
one projection is for there being a gap

181
00:07:42,050 --> 00:07:43,960
of three and a half million globally

182
00:07:43,960 --> 00:07:46,310
it's different debates about about where

183
00:07:46,310 --> 00:07:48,680
it is but it's generally agreed it seems

184
00:07:48,680 --> 00:07:50,090
to me to be in the order of a million

185
00:07:50,090 --> 00:07:53,060
the millions and what we're seeing that

186
00:07:53,060 --> 00:07:55,190
as coming alongside the six million

187
00:07:55,190 --> 00:07:57,020
people I just talked about there's three

188
00:07:57,020 --> 00:07:58,370
and a half a million talent gap and

189
00:07:58,370 --> 00:08:00,050
we're coming together and connecting the

190
00:08:00,050 --> 00:08:04,100
two with a proven process that works and

191
00:08:04,100 --> 00:08:05,810
we're definitely not saying that you

192
00:08:05,810 --> 00:08:07,370
know all autistic people should be in

193
00:08:07,370 --> 00:08:09,080
cybersecurity there's definitely other

194
00:08:09,080 --> 00:08:11,600
areas that I'm I'm looking in in fact we

195
00:08:11,600 --> 00:08:14,450
think autistic people know one so that

196
00:08:14,450 --> 00:08:16,550
we know giving us a glimpse that they

197
00:08:16,550 --> 00:08:18,650
can do anything when they put their

198
00:08:18,650 --> 00:08:21,230
minds to what we're seeing in cyber is

199
00:08:21,230 --> 00:08:23,120
an incredible lining up with some of the

200
00:08:23,120 --> 00:08:24,470
strengths that we keep seeing across

201
00:08:24,470 --> 00:08:26,540
this group now we keep hearing of people

202
00:08:26,540 --> 00:08:34,120
that are really excelling as well now

203
00:08:34,120 --> 00:08:37,270
autistic people sits within a broader

204
00:08:37,270 --> 00:08:41,090
sphere of newer diversity now what is

205
00:08:41,090 --> 00:08:43,130
new University is a collection of

206
00:08:43,130 --> 00:08:46,160
conditions that affects the brain your

207
00:08:46,160 --> 00:08:48,080
logical conditions that have both

208
00:08:48,080 --> 00:08:50,900
challenges and strengths so you'll see

209
00:08:50,900 --> 00:08:53,900
on there autism is one of those others

210
00:08:53,900 --> 00:08:54,930
include 80

211
00:08:54,930 --> 00:08:58,620
be a dyslexia dyspraxia other things

212
00:08:58,620 --> 00:09:00,420
some of you may have heard of some may

213
00:09:00,420 --> 00:09:01,710
not be safe some of them may be new to

214
00:09:01,710 --> 00:09:05,490
you but what we begin to realize is the

215
00:09:05,490 --> 00:09:07,710
that the commonalities between these

216
00:09:07,710 --> 00:09:10,230
with autism is that they often present

217
00:09:10,230 --> 00:09:13,440
barriers to getting work but when people

218
00:09:13,440 --> 00:09:14,940
get work they often present really

219
00:09:14,940 --> 00:09:18,000
really unique skills you'll see on this

220
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:22,170
slide the the lines the phrases

221
00:09:22,170 --> 00:09:23,940
underneath each condition are some of

222
00:09:23,940 --> 00:09:26,970
the strengths in those areas and for

223
00:09:26,970 --> 00:09:29,340
exceptional we started focusing on

224
00:09:29,340 --> 00:09:31,470
autistic people and now we've begun to

225
00:09:31,470 --> 00:09:35,220
expand to provide services to help other

226
00:09:35,220 --> 00:09:37,860
new @os people get work we're starting

227
00:09:37,860 --> 00:09:43,200
to realize what a massive group misses

228
00:09:43,200 --> 00:09:47,220
in fact some experts believe it numbers

229
00:09:47,220 --> 00:09:49,530
1 billion one in seven people on the

230
00:09:49,530 --> 00:09:53,010
planet fit in this group 17 percent and

231
00:09:53,010 --> 00:09:55,430
when you add them all up together and

232
00:09:55,430 --> 00:09:57,420
let's just stop and think about that

233
00:09:57,420 --> 00:09:59,670
number for a moment imagine if you're

234
00:09:59,670 --> 00:10:01,500
someone that is hiring or your team is

235
00:10:01,500 --> 00:10:04,520
hiring someone you imagine if you were

236
00:10:04,520 --> 00:10:06,990
unintentionally discounting a billion

237
00:10:06,990 --> 00:10:10,260
people from that job some of whom could

238
00:10:10,260 --> 00:10:12,000
potentially be the best people for that

239
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:15,030
job and that's a really shocking thing

240
00:10:15,030 --> 00:10:17,760
and something that is worth changing

241
00:10:17,760 --> 00:10:19,950
your recruitment changing your your

242
00:10:19,950 --> 00:10:24,270
workplace in in small but your ways

243
00:10:24,270 --> 00:10:29,850
actually have an impact so what are the

244
00:10:29,850 --> 00:10:31,350
strengths of this group I've touched on

245
00:10:31,350 --> 00:10:34,140
some of them and yeah and I'll just go

246
00:10:34,140 --> 00:10:39,450
through a few specific examples one is a

247
00:10:39,450 --> 00:10:42,900
real ability for deep focus you know

248
00:10:42,900 --> 00:10:44,640
some of the people I've met in there in

249
00:10:44,640 --> 00:10:47,130
the security world tell me that often

250
00:10:47,130 --> 00:10:49,080
when there's a major system and there's

251
00:10:49,080 --> 00:10:51,440
a real big problem and some

252
00:10:51,440 --> 00:10:53,190
vulnerabilities been discovered you've

253
00:10:53,190 --> 00:10:55,410
got to lock the doors and not leave

254
00:10:55,410 --> 00:10:58,350
until it's solved and I've heard of

255
00:10:58,350 --> 00:10:59,840
examples of there being multiple days

256
00:10:59,840 --> 00:11:02,130
you know our talent pool have an amazing

257
00:11:02,130 --> 00:11:04,890
ability to focus on on that sort of

258
00:11:04,890 --> 00:11:06,690
timeframe and really just keep going

259
00:11:06,690 --> 00:11:09,340
until the problem is solved

260
00:11:09,340 --> 00:11:11,480
secondly there can be amazing at

261
00:11:11,480 --> 00:11:12,980
problem-solving getting to the bottom

262
00:11:12,980 --> 00:11:15,320
not just faster as I sit here but also

263
00:11:15,320 --> 00:11:17,570
more creatively thinking outside the box

264
00:11:17,570 --> 00:11:20,270
the JPMorgan have a autism hiring

265
00:11:20,270 --> 00:11:21,710
program in the u.s. that they've

266
00:11:21,710 --> 00:11:23,420
accent's expanded to more than 10

267
00:11:23,420 --> 00:11:26,720
countries and if a bank does something

268
00:11:26,720 --> 00:11:28,940
in multiple countries then they must

269
00:11:28,940 --> 00:11:30,290
believe that it's really impacting their

270
00:11:30,290 --> 00:11:32,660
bottom line and with their autism at

271
00:11:32,660 --> 00:11:34,850
work program they deduced that the

272
00:11:34,850 --> 00:11:37,940
employees were 48 percent faster and 92

273
00:11:37,940 --> 00:11:42,970
percent more productive and yeah often

274
00:11:42,970 --> 00:11:45,080
people we work with have a superior

275
00:11:45,080 --> 00:11:47,120
memory but it's II do have cool facts

276
00:11:47,120 --> 00:11:50,300
and processes ways of doing things so it

277
00:11:50,300 --> 00:11:51,980
could be you know some are working on a

278
00:11:51,980 --> 00:11:54,770
system recourse a vulnerability that

279
00:11:54,770 --> 00:11:56,510
they saw on a on a pass system that

280
00:11:56,510 --> 00:11:58,190
mirrors this one you know five ten years

281
00:11:58,190 --> 00:11:59,960
ago remembers that they can apply it

282
00:11:59,960 --> 00:12:02,590
here that memory also means that

283
00:12:02,590 --> 00:12:04,760
individuals have a real ability to get

284
00:12:04,760 --> 00:12:07,970
into a nice topic understand an area in

285
00:12:07,970 --> 00:12:11,350
real detail that makes them often real

286
00:12:11,350 --> 00:12:15,710
subject matter experts what fascinates

287
00:12:15,710 --> 00:12:18,050
me is in the medical field there used to

288
00:12:18,050 --> 00:12:20,750
see that kind of niche interest area as

289
00:12:20,750 --> 00:12:21,350
a negative

290
00:12:21,350 --> 00:12:23,360
you know people getting too narrow into

291
00:12:23,360 --> 00:12:25,220
one particular area but actually

292
00:12:25,220 --> 00:12:27,410
nowadays it's seen as a positive that

293
00:12:27,410 --> 00:12:30,170
people are focusing on something in such

294
00:12:30,170 --> 00:12:31,790
details that they're the person you go

295
00:12:31,790 --> 00:12:33,230
to when you want to solve that problem

296
00:12:33,230 --> 00:12:34,910
they're the person you go to when you

297
00:12:34,910 --> 00:12:36,830
want to get a real deep understanding of

298
00:12:36,830 --> 00:12:39,410
how to prevent problems coming up in

299
00:12:39,410 --> 00:12:43,100
that area and so forth Lee a real

300
00:12:43,100 --> 00:12:46,130
attention to detail but a Teta to spot

301
00:12:46,130 --> 00:12:48,740
patterns in data one of the people that

302
00:12:48,740 --> 00:12:51,110
we placed at a bank near on day one she

303
00:12:51,110 --> 00:12:53,000
could see ways that systems could be

304
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:55,490
improved and that some of the current

305
00:12:55,490 --> 00:12:59,000
systems were you know adding in you know

306
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:00,830
making people lose time because of the

307
00:13:00,830 --> 00:13:02,630
way they're doing things and she saw

308
00:13:02,630 --> 00:13:04,730
that because of her ability to look at

309
00:13:04,730 --> 00:13:06,980
patterns and look at systems and and see

310
00:13:06,980 --> 00:13:10,000
that detail that others missed

311
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:14,450
and finally that high integrity of

312
00:13:14,450 --> 00:13:15,980
people that we work with really stick it

313
00:13:15,980 --> 00:13:18,080
out with their employers and there's a

314
00:13:18,080 --> 00:13:22,310
real high retention rate as people

315
00:13:22,310 --> 00:13:24,530
yeah really really continue on in the

316
00:13:24,530 --> 00:13:26,270
work that they're doing they want to do

317
00:13:26,270 --> 00:13:28,280
that well and stick with the employers

318
00:13:28,280 --> 00:13:29,300
something that a lot of people are

319
00:13:29,300 --> 00:13:32,780
looking for today so I'll give you a few

320
00:13:32,780 --> 00:13:35,330
three examples of people that I know

321
00:13:35,330 --> 00:13:39,110
I've met who are autistic and really

322
00:13:39,110 --> 00:13:40,790
doing amazing work

323
00:13:40,790 --> 00:13:45,050
the first one is Temple Grandin she's a

324
00:13:45,050 --> 00:13:46,310
lady that I had the privilege of meeting

325
00:13:46,310 --> 00:13:48,740
last year in when she came out to

326
00:13:48,740 --> 00:13:52,670
Melbourne in Australia and temple was

327
00:13:52,670 --> 00:13:55,270
working in the animal husbandry industry

328
00:13:55,270 --> 00:13:57,620
so it doesn't sound directly relevant to

329
00:13:57,620 --> 00:13:59,300
cybersecurity but I'll get there give me

330
00:13:59,300 --> 00:14:02,990
a moment this is a drawing that she did

331
00:14:02,990 --> 00:14:05,360
early on in her career and this is a

332
00:14:05,360 --> 00:14:08,870
drawing of a cattle dip that cows go

333
00:14:08,870 --> 00:14:10,160
through when they're being cleaned and

334
00:14:10,160 --> 00:14:13,010
you'll see it's circular and what she

335
00:14:13,010 --> 00:14:15,050
did she spent hours observing cattle in

336
00:14:15,050 --> 00:14:17,420
fields and noted that when they were

337
00:14:17,420 --> 00:14:20,870
calm they walked in circles and when

338
00:14:20,870 --> 00:14:23,120
they were upset they would stampede and

339
00:14:23,120 --> 00:14:25,550
they'd run in a straight line and the

340
00:14:25,550 --> 00:14:27,500
traditional cattle dips were in straight

341
00:14:27,500 --> 00:14:30,050
lines and so every now and then one of

342
00:14:30,050 --> 00:14:32,660
the cattle would get upset and they

343
00:14:32,660 --> 00:14:34,730
would bolt into the water and often

344
00:14:34,730 --> 00:14:36,950
sadly they'd drown and then they'd have

345
00:14:36,950 --> 00:14:39,560
to stop the whole process and to get

346
00:14:39,560 --> 00:14:41,240
that cattle out often for several hours

347
00:14:41,240 --> 00:14:43,040
to sort things out particular from

348
00:14:43,040 --> 00:14:45,410
machinery we've got broken or if several

349
00:14:45,410 --> 00:14:47,330
cattle were affected and temple realize

350
00:14:47,330 --> 00:14:51,050
if you put the dip in a circle then that

351
00:14:51,050 --> 00:14:52,520
would calmly cut off they would think

352
00:14:52,520 --> 00:14:55,220
that they were in a more karma a

353
00:14:55,220 --> 00:14:57,200
situation walking around in those

354
00:14:57,200 --> 00:14:59,600
circles and second thing she did you'll

355
00:14:59,600 --> 00:15:01,490
see the sides are kind of quite straight

356
00:15:01,490 --> 00:15:05,150
those are the walls and in the past they

357
00:15:05,150 --> 00:15:07,070
would have fences that would have you

358
00:15:07,070 --> 00:15:09,080
know gaps between them like this and the

359
00:15:09,080 --> 00:15:10,460
colour would look through the gaps and

360
00:15:10,460 --> 00:15:12,410
they might see a car or a reflection in

361
00:15:12,410 --> 00:15:14,600
a mirror or somebody's red clothing a

362
00:15:14,600 --> 00:15:17,000
red t-shirt and they would get upset and

363
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:18,470
then that would also cause them to bolt

364
00:15:18,470 --> 00:15:21,190
so what she did she put walls that were

365
00:15:21,190 --> 00:15:24,980
solid you had no gaps in them and all

366
00:15:24,980 --> 00:15:27,800
these things added up to mean that the

367
00:15:27,800 --> 00:15:30,709
cat or the process was better for the

368
00:15:30,709 --> 00:15:33,530
farmers in fact there's a fantastic

369
00:15:33,530 --> 00:15:35,970
Claire Danes movie made about temples

370
00:15:35,970 --> 00:15:39,809
and at the moment Claire Danes betrays

371
00:15:39,809 --> 00:15:42,329
temple said that temple the Claire Danes

372
00:15:42,329 --> 00:15:44,069
really betrayed this moment well when

373
00:15:44,069 --> 00:15:45,599
she went into the owner of the ranch his

374
00:15:45,599 --> 00:15:47,849
office and said you've got a you've got

375
00:15:47,849 --> 00:15:49,619
to follow my suggestions

376
00:15:49,619 --> 00:15:52,109
otherwise you'll be losing hours on the

377
00:15:52,109 --> 00:15:53,879
production and you can see this moment

378
00:15:53,879 --> 00:15:56,039
when he realizes this press is really

379
00:15:56,039 --> 00:15:57,029
onto something that's going to have a

380
00:15:57,029 --> 00:16:00,899
positive impact on the business and you

381
00:16:00,899 --> 00:16:02,159
know although this seems to be not a

382
00:16:02,159 --> 00:16:04,169
cybersecurity connected thing I'm not

383
00:16:04,169 --> 00:16:06,119
suggesting the temple should work in

384
00:16:06,119 --> 00:16:08,279
cybersecurity but for me this shows that

385
00:16:08,279 --> 00:16:10,859
she saw a kind of vulnerability a risk

386
00:16:10,859 --> 00:16:14,009
in the system and took steps to using

387
00:16:14,009 --> 00:16:17,129
her unique insight to really get rid of

388
00:16:17,129 --> 00:16:20,659
that and I said we see that applying to

389
00:16:20,659 --> 00:16:24,089
to security to app SEC where the people

390
00:16:24,089 --> 00:16:25,439
who are actually often have that ability

391
00:16:25,439 --> 00:16:28,079
to think outside the box and to voice

392
00:16:28,079 --> 00:16:31,349
their ideas and to be really frank with

393
00:16:31,349 --> 00:16:32,939
the ways that they can see systems that

394
00:16:32,939 --> 00:16:35,489
should be perhaps changing to be more

395
00:16:35,489 --> 00:16:39,769
curved than they are currently straight

396
00:16:40,009 --> 00:16:43,379
second example someone I want to tell

397
00:16:43,379 --> 00:16:46,139
you about is Anthony though he came to

398
00:16:46,139 --> 00:16:50,639
us now about two years ago and at the

399
00:16:50,639 --> 00:16:51,959
time he was really struggling with

400
00:16:51,959 --> 00:16:53,879
interviews despite himself having

401
00:16:53,879 --> 00:16:58,529
multiple degrees and he including a PhD

402
00:16:58,529 --> 00:17:01,199
in physics and he told me he didn't that

403
00:17:01,199 --> 00:17:02,579
you would ever get a job in a company

404
00:17:02,579 --> 00:17:05,549
that was a household name and so we put

405
00:17:05,549 --> 00:17:07,529
him through our customized interview

406
00:17:07,529 --> 00:17:09,779
process where we get people to show

407
00:17:09,779 --> 00:17:12,959
their strength to play games do puzzles

408
00:17:12,959 --> 00:17:15,839
they really understand how their brains

409
00:17:15,839 --> 00:17:18,720
think I remember Anthony was going

410
00:17:18,720 --> 00:17:20,009
through this activity called the

411
00:17:20,009 --> 00:17:22,169
triangle program which is pretty simple

412
00:17:22,169 --> 00:17:25,199
piece of software that takes three sides

413
00:17:25,199 --> 00:17:28,349
of a triangle and three inputs and

414
00:17:28,349 --> 00:17:30,899
outputs the type of triangle so let's

415
00:17:30,899 --> 00:17:34,350
say you input 3 3 & 3 the program will

416
00:17:34,350 --> 00:17:36,870
tell you that it's an equilateral

417
00:17:36,870 --> 00:17:39,299
triangle you give it five five and one

418
00:17:39,299 --> 00:17:41,570
it will tell you that it's an isosceles

419
00:17:41,570 --> 00:17:45,720
and yes

420
00:17:45,720 --> 00:17:49,230
and so forth and what Anthony did is he

421
00:17:49,230 --> 00:17:51,960
started asking questions like actually

422
00:17:51,960 --> 00:17:54,360
clarifying questions does this apply

423
00:17:54,360 --> 00:17:56,520
also to 3d geometry what about if you're

424
00:17:56,520 --> 00:17:59,070
mapping onto a sphere he said to me Mike

425
00:17:59,070 --> 00:18:01,320
you know cuz looking at triangles maps

426
00:18:01,320 --> 00:18:02,640
on a sphere they actually act quite

427
00:18:02,640 --> 00:18:05,250
differently and I just thought that was

428
00:18:05,250 --> 00:18:07,320
such an insightful way of thinking that

429
00:18:07,320 --> 00:18:08,850
I called over the hiring manager who was

430
00:18:08,850 --> 00:18:11,549
in the room he came over asked auntie to

431
00:18:11,549 --> 00:18:14,220
explain his questioning to the hiring

432
00:18:14,220 --> 00:18:16,950
manager and he was so blown away that

433
00:18:16,950 --> 00:18:19,289
and see ended up getting a job ends up

434
00:18:19,289 --> 00:18:20,549
being deployed with one of the biggest

435
00:18:20,549 --> 00:18:23,400
banks in Australia and has since been

436
00:18:23,400 --> 00:18:26,490
promoted as well and yeah what

437
00:18:26,490 --> 00:18:28,470
fascinated me was how a friend he was

438
00:18:28,470 --> 00:18:30,750
just asking clarifying questions based

439
00:18:30,750 --> 00:18:32,850
on his abilities and his knowledge in

440
00:18:32,850 --> 00:18:35,039
physics and before hiring manager it

441
00:18:35,039 --> 00:18:37,230
really showed him insights into how

442
00:18:37,230 --> 00:18:39,419
Anthony thinks that wouldn't come across

443
00:18:39,419 --> 00:18:45,990
in a traditional interview the third

444
00:18:45,990 --> 00:18:48,210
person that I want to tell you about is

445
00:18:48,210 --> 00:18:53,280
Tim and he came to us via actually a TV

446
00:18:53,280 --> 00:18:55,230
show there was tracking job seekers in

447
00:18:55,230 --> 00:18:59,370
there their job seeking journey and Tim

448
00:18:59,370 --> 00:19:01,470
came to us and one of the puzzles that

449
00:19:01,470 --> 00:19:03,179
we put to him in the interview process

450
00:19:03,179 --> 00:19:07,950
was a dice puzzle and what we tend to do

451
00:19:07,950 --> 00:19:11,370
she won't play in person

452
00:19:11,370 --> 00:19:14,340
I had the dice around my table but I've

453
00:19:14,340 --> 00:19:18,270
I've put them away when we play in

454
00:19:18,270 --> 00:19:20,340
person we'll roll the dice and we'll use

455
00:19:20,340 --> 00:19:23,580
a formula that the interviewer comes up

456
00:19:23,580 --> 00:19:26,669
with on the dice to come up with with a

457
00:19:26,669 --> 00:19:29,370
result and the person going through has

458
00:19:29,370 --> 00:19:30,840
to prom themself by thinking through

459
00:19:30,840 --> 00:19:33,299
what that formula might be trying

460
00:19:33,299 --> 00:19:36,630
different cases and you'll see isn't you

461
00:19:36,630 --> 00:19:37,860
know often they will start with example

462
00:19:37,860 --> 00:19:39,090
like adding up the dice and then

463
00:19:39,090 --> 00:19:42,120
multiplying them and then you know doing

464
00:19:42,120 --> 00:19:44,630
other yes adding to or subtracting one

465
00:19:44,630 --> 00:19:47,669
this one all the top three answers come

466
00:19:47,669 --> 00:19:51,480
up with 13 but the bottom one doesn't so

467
00:19:51,480 --> 00:19:53,809
this one actually is a multiple of

468
00:19:53,809 --> 00:19:56,340
addition of the dice and then while them

469
00:19:56,340 --> 00:19:58,279
is being multiplied

470
00:19:58,279 --> 00:20:01,389
let me see for memory I think it's six

471
00:20:01,389 --> 00:20:04,820
and then adding on three times the

472
00:20:04,820 --> 00:20:07,730
middle dice which is 50 minus two yeah

473
00:20:07,730 --> 00:20:10,220
that gives thirteen and then one plus

474
00:20:10,220 --> 00:20:14,360
multiple three of the five is 16 minus

475
00:20:14,360 --> 00:20:17,750
three again is thirty so yeah using that

476
00:20:17,750 --> 00:20:19,850
you can deduce that but you know that's

477
00:20:19,850 --> 00:20:21,470
not quite how quickly I'm giving you the

478
00:20:21,470 --> 00:20:23,080
answer there but when we do this game

479
00:20:23,080 --> 00:20:25,970
then yeah we give hints we give

480
00:20:25,970 --> 00:20:28,159
suggestions and try and understand how

481
00:20:28,159 --> 00:20:31,279
an individual thinks particular in the

482
00:20:31,279 --> 00:20:33,980
tech airworthy to apply in mathematical

483
00:20:33,980 --> 00:20:35,779
skills nominal thinking problem-solving

484
00:20:35,779 --> 00:20:37,940
and it's him was actually the first

485
00:20:37,940 --> 00:20:40,759
person that that once he got this puzzle

486
00:20:40,759 --> 00:20:42,230
and really and the different ways we

487
00:20:42,230 --> 00:20:44,240
played it he wanted to turn it back on

488
00:20:44,240 --> 00:20:46,700
me as the interviewer he won't ever go

489
00:20:46,700 --> 00:20:48,379
come up with his own algorithm and

490
00:20:48,379 --> 00:20:50,509
quickly came up with ones that I

491
00:20:50,509 --> 00:20:52,970
couldn't work through but it was it

492
00:20:52,970 --> 00:20:54,919
really showed how well he got this

493
00:20:54,919 --> 00:20:57,889
activity and now folly enough he's being

494
00:20:57,889 --> 00:21:00,110
deployed in one one of the thick client

495
00:21:00,110 --> 00:21:04,100
work that he's doing is working on an an

496
00:21:04,100 --> 00:21:08,330
amp for exceptional to help us provide

497
00:21:08,330 --> 00:21:10,580
this puzzle in it in interviews to

498
00:21:10,580 --> 00:21:17,779
people more broadly but there are many

499
00:21:17,779 --> 00:21:20,330
other companies like us like the

500
00:21:20,330 --> 00:21:22,879
examples of tear and Anthony that are

501
00:21:22,879 --> 00:21:25,159
deploying people who are newer diverse

502
00:21:25,159 --> 00:21:28,820
in technology and in cyber jobs in

503
00:21:28,820 --> 00:21:33,019
particular one other example from this

504
00:21:33,019 --> 00:21:37,220
broad board which really was relevant

505
00:21:37,220 --> 00:21:39,769
for the coronavirus time was geo synergy

506
00:21:39,769 --> 00:21:41,779
on the right they're a firm up in

507
00:21:41,779 --> 00:21:44,090
Brisbane and we place an individual with

508
00:21:44,090 --> 00:21:47,269
them who has several hundred miles away

509
00:21:47,269 --> 00:21:49,789
actually in a different state and he was

510
00:21:49,789 --> 00:21:52,220
interviewed remotely assessed remotely

511
00:21:52,220 --> 00:21:54,379
put through these puzzles remotely from

512
00:21:54,379 --> 00:21:56,179
home and now he's working around he

513
00:21:56,179 --> 00:21:57,409
found he's never in person

514
00:21:57,409 --> 00:22:00,409
as I understand it his employer and they

515
00:22:00,409 --> 00:22:03,169
talk they work over slack and yeah that

516
00:22:03,169 --> 00:22:05,210
happened actually back in January just

517
00:22:05,210 --> 00:22:07,519
before Crona virus and really got a lot

518
00:22:07,519 --> 00:22:11,360
of interest during this time and we did

519
00:22:11,360 --> 00:22:11,929
a survey

520
00:22:11,929 --> 00:22:15,289
people we work with 92% of them would

521
00:22:15,289 --> 00:22:17,389
prefer to work all a part of their time

522
00:22:17,389 --> 00:22:20,539
from home this is a group that sadly for

523
00:22:20,539 --> 00:22:22,909
too long have experienced four years of

524
00:22:22,909 --> 00:22:24,889
experience social license social

525
00:22:24,889 --> 00:22:27,440
isolation because of being locked out of

526
00:22:27,440 --> 00:22:29,869
the job market and but now this presents

527
00:22:29,869 --> 00:22:32,419
an opportunity for them to get back into

528
00:22:32,419 --> 00:22:38,690
the workforce another organization which

529
00:22:38,690 --> 00:22:40,999
has been three decades embracing

530
00:22:40,999 --> 00:22:45,409
neurodiversity is the GCHQ in london the

531
00:22:45,409 --> 00:22:47,600
government communications department it

532
00:22:47,600 --> 00:22:49,429
says on their new University on their

533
00:22:49,429 --> 00:22:51,409
diversity inclusion webpage without new

534
00:22:51,409 --> 00:22:54,259
diverse new University we wouldn't be

535
00:22:54,259 --> 00:22:57,320
GCHQ it's so fundamental to everything

536
00:22:57,320 --> 00:23:00,139
they do going back to the 1940s and

537
00:23:00,139 --> 00:23:02,539
1950s during the second world war they

538
00:23:02,539 --> 00:23:05,809
had code breakers who were newer diverse

539
00:23:05,809 --> 00:23:07,749
people that really thought differently

540
00:23:07,749 --> 00:23:09,919
and they've come to realize over the

541
00:23:09,919 --> 00:23:11,450
decades that they will need to support

542
00:23:11,450 --> 00:23:14,749
and hire from this group and in fact now

543
00:23:14,749 --> 00:23:16,759
all their process is a very neurodiverse

544
00:23:16,759 --> 00:23:19,340
friendly and you know particularly

545
00:23:19,340 --> 00:23:23,360
targeted at adding to this to their poor

546
00:23:23,360 --> 00:23:26,600
that are from this group another example

547
00:23:26,600 --> 00:23:29,179
of a station hiring in this space is the

548
00:23:29,179 --> 00:23:31,070
New South Wales government where we're

549
00:23:31,070 --> 00:23:33,559
based in Australia they are affect the

550
00:23:33,559 --> 00:23:35,149
largest employer in the southern

551
00:23:35,149 --> 00:23:39,710
hemisphere 400,000 people work for the

552
00:23:39,710 --> 00:23:42,080
New South Wales government when you

553
00:23:42,080 --> 00:23:43,220
consider how many people are in the

554
00:23:43,220 --> 00:23:45,409
southern hemisphere that is about one in

555
00:23:45,409 --> 00:23:48,320
two thousand so actually a really

556
00:23:48,320 --> 00:23:51,230
significant employer and this is Gladys

557
00:23:51,230 --> 00:23:55,309
virgilian and Gareth Ward the Minister

558
00:23:55,309 --> 00:23:57,049
for disability they recently now it's

559
00:23:57,049 --> 00:23:59,450
just in March that they are targeting an

560
00:23:59,450 --> 00:24:01,639
additional 10,000 people disabilities

561
00:24:01,639 --> 00:24:03,710
that they want to hire to increase their

562
00:24:03,710 --> 00:24:08,059
percentage up to 5.6 percent by 2025 and

563
00:24:08,059 --> 00:24:10,070
then really taking efforts to hire from

564
00:24:10,070 --> 00:24:12,019
from this group one thing that we're

565
00:24:12,019 --> 00:24:13,399
doing with them is one of the

566
00:24:13,399 --> 00:24:16,429
departments finding people to work in

567
00:24:16,429 --> 00:24:19,789
their cyber security division and yeah

568
00:24:19,789 --> 00:24:21,499
it's interesting to see how they've gone

569
00:24:21,499 --> 00:24:22,789
initially they wanted people of a

570
00:24:22,789 --> 00:24:24,980
certain skill level and experience and

571
00:24:24,980 --> 00:24:25,190
then

572
00:24:25,190 --> 00:24:26,660
start to realize actually this is such a

573
00:24:26,660 --> 00:24:29,540
hard group hard time a person defined a

574
00:24:29,540 --> 00:24:31,010
type of skill that they became more

575
00:24:31,010 --> 00:24:33,680
flexible willing to take people that

576
00:24:33,680 --> 00:24:37,370
were had the propensity to work and be

577
00:24:37,370 --> 00:24:39,230
trained up in this field rather than

578
00:24:39,230 --> 00:24:44,600
having made a career in it already in

579
00:24:44,600 --> 00:24:47,600
the UK this network of organisations

580
00:24:47,600 --> 00:24:51,560
that are in the cybersecurity newer

581
00:24:51,560 --> 00:24:54,350
diverse space they formed a group to

582
00:24:54,350 --> 00:24:56,810
really learn from each other and we're

583
00:24:56,810 --> 00:24:58,880
hoping that other other countries will

584
00:24:58,880 --> 00:25:01,220
will follow their lead it's amazing to

585
00:25:01,220 --> 00:25:03,260
see how many see this as the important

586
00:25:03,260 --> 00:25:07,310
space this chart really sums up for me

587
00:25:07,310 --> 00:25:10,130
the the missed opportunity you see on

588
00:25:10,130 --> 00:25:13,760
the right hand side the US the chart for

589
00:25:13,760 --> 00:25:16,010
people without disability and the the

590
00:25:16,010 --> 00:25:19,370
population that are employed unfortunate

591
00:25:19,370 --> 00:25:21,800
import Pruitt on the left is the portion

592
00:25:21,800 --> 00:25:23,810
of people with disability for people who

593
00:25:23,810 --> 00:25:25,730
are newer diverse people and for people

594
00:25:25,730 --> 00:25:28,310
who are autistic autistic the number is

595
00:25:28,310 --> 00:25:30,830
even less some estimates put that down

596
00:25:30,830 --> 00:25:35,780
the 20% or even lower and so yet seeing

597
00:25:35,780 --> 00:25:38,470
those differences it really is

598
00:25:38,470 --> 00:25:41,000
concerning both for the individuals but

599
00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:42,980
also for companies that are looking for

600
00:25:42,980 --> 00:25:46,310
top talent now why is that while there

601
00:25:46,310 --> 00:25:48,460
are some challenges so I've touched upon

602
00:25:48,460 --> 00:25:50,930
that prevent barriers and prevent people

603
00:25:50,930 --> 00:25:54,770
getting in one is social isolation so

604
00:25:54,770 --> 00:25:57,140
social interaction if you're using the

605
00:25:57,140 --> 00:25:59,090
word the phrase socialization so it's so

606
00:25:59,090 --> 00:26:00,830
long it's just slipping off my tongue

607
00:26:00,830 --> 00:26:03,050
unintentionally there but in a sense

608
00:26:03,050 --> 00:26:04,550
this group have experienced social I say

609
00:26:04,550 --> 00:26:06,380
a lot isolation for too long

610
00:26:06,380 --> 00:26:09,320
and that those interactions socially are

611
00:26:09,320 --> 00:26:11,450
challenging and so an interview moment

612
00:26:11,450 --> 00:26:14,030
way off thrown in a social situation

613
00:26:14,030 --> 00:26:17,090
with someone completely new and such

614
00:26:17,090 --> 00:26:19,490
high stakes is stressful for all of us

615
00:26:19,490 --> 00:26:21,170
but particularly for people that

616
00:26:21,170 --> 00:26:23,780
experience high anxiety and it's even

617
00:26:23,780 --> 00:26:26,780
tougher recruitment processes are

618
00:26:26,780 --> 00:26:29,660
written in a really standardized way to

619
00:26:29,660 --> 00:26:33,290
accept you know most people but they

620
00:26:33,290 --> 00:26:35,150
miss out people on the fringes I had a

621
00:26:35,150 --> 00:26:37,880
fascinating step report just last month

622
00:26:37,880 --> 00:26:39,759
that said that

623
00:26:39,759 --> 00:26:44,240
35% of CEO surveyed in the UK are

624
00:26:44,240 --> 00:26:47,870
dyslexic and dyslexia one of them is

625
00:26:47,870 --> 00:26:50,179
Richard Branson and so with a high

626
00:26:50,179 --> 00:26:52,809
proportion of people a surprising that

627
00:26:52,809 --> 00:26:55,490
you know Peru we've dyslexia being the

628
00:26:55,490 --> 00:26:56,990
CEO so surprising that job

629
00:26:56,990 --> 00:26:58,970
applying for job starts with filling in

630
00:26:58,970 --> 00:27:00,740
a form it starts with putting down words

631
00:27:00,740 --> 00:27:02,389
on paper which works for some people

632
00:27:02,389 --> 00:27:05,750
many but not all and I'm hoping other

633
00:27:05,750 --> 00:27:08,269
CEOs will see see this disparity and

634
00:27:08,269 --> 00:27:11,059
help lead for for change a more

635
00:27:11,059 --> 00:27:14,409
alternative paths of getting jobs

636
00:27:14,409 --> 00:27:17,210
thirdly challenges with communication

637
00:27:17,210 --> 00:27:20,179
with expressing those incredible things

638
00:27:20,179 --> 00:27:23,509
that going on in someone's brain and

639
00:27:23,509 --> 00:27:24,980
getting them on paper it's really hard I

640
00:27:24,980 --> 00:27:27,470
can personally empathize with that doing

641
00:27:27,470 --> 00:27:29,720
public speaking like this is a challenge

642
00:27:29,720 --> 00:27:32,720
for me I had to do my public policy

643
00:27:32,720 --> 00:27:34,460
degree at Harvard I took no less than

644
00:27:34,460 --> 00:27:37,940
four courses on presenting on telling

645
00:27:37,940 --> 00:27:40,730
stories on public speaking because I saw

646
00:27:40,730 --> 00:27:42,110
it was an area that I found really hard

647
00:27:42,110 --> 00:27:44,509
and it's like an empathize with the

648
00:27:44,509 --> 00:27:47,179
people that we work with who really

649
00:27:47,179 --> 00:27:48,559
struggle to articulate themselves in

650
00:27:48,559 --> 00:27:51,409
interviews under the final part of that

651
00:27:51,409 --> 00:27:54,289
all these challenges add up to make for

652
00:27:54,289 --> 00:27:57,559
this long term a social isolation of

653
00:27:57,559 --> 00:28:03,559
unemployment and someone else that

654
00:28:03,559 --> 00:28:07,009
zeroed in on these challenges is a chap

655
00:28:07,009 --> 00:28:09,259
called red-green Hagen that's worked in

656
00:28:09,259 --> 00:28:12,080
the US military is autistic himself and

657
00:28:12,080 --> 00:28:16,490
he did a survey of 290 people on the

658
00:28:16,490 --> 00:28:19,639
spectrum who are working in security and

659
00:28:19,639 --> 00:28:21,350
the first thing that stood out to me was

660
00:28:21,350 --> 00:28:24,379
wow he was able to find that many people

661
00:28:24,379 --> 00:28:26,269
working this field I don't there's many

662
00:28:26,269 --> 00:28:28,759
other fields that we're placing people

663
00:28:28,759 --> 00:28:30,649
in where we can quickly and easily find

664
00:28:30,649 --> 00:28:32,950
that many people to complete a survey

665
00:28:32,950 --> 00:28:35,600
partly picture of how well-connected he

666
00:28:35,600 --> 00:28:38,960
is and but also it shows you how many

667
00:28:38,960 --> 00:28:40,820
people in that group and the two

668
00:28:40,820 --> 00:28:42,500
challenges he really zeroed in on there

669
00:28:42,500 --> 00:28:45,620
the yellow and the blue were the biggest

670
00:28:45,620 --> 00:28:48,350
- one is the social connection I just

671
00:28:48,350 --> 00:28:50,029
mentioned the yellow one that actually

672
00:28:50,029 --> 00:28:52,880
the biggest is the sensory

673
00:28:52,880 --> 00:28:56,840
challenges so yeah things like we're

674
00:28:56,840 --> 00:28:58,100
going to this a bit more detail things

675
00:28:58,100 --> 00:29:00,740
like the light right now got this bright

676
00:29:00,740 --> 00:29:02,810
for us and the lights on so you can see

677
00:29:02,810 --> 00:29:04,520
me often where we have a meetup for

678
00:29:04,520 --> 00:29:06,500
autistic people working in tech we'll

679
00:29:06,500 --> 00:29:10,100
turn these off and yeah it's lights can

680
00:29:10,100 --> 00:29:12,650
be really frustrating it also sounds as

681
00:29:12,650 --> 00:29:16,600
well different social different sensory

682
00:29:16,600 --> 00:29:19,820
noises and and signals can really

683
00:29:19,820 --> 00:29:21,530
negatively impacts on people in the

684
00:29:21,530 --> 00:29:25,040
workplace so after this stage when are

685
00:29:25,040 --> 00:29:26,930
you in presentation we will go through

686
00:29:26,930 --> 00:29:28,550
an exercise that's a little challenging

687
00:29:28,550 --> 00:29:31,010
to do right now but one that helps you

688
00:29:31,010 --> 00:29:33,230
understand the concept of a sensory diet

689
00:29:33,230 --> 00:29:36,410
and that is that all of us like the way

690
00:29:36,410 --> 00:29:38,120
that we take in food and have different

691
00:29:38,120 --> 00:29:40,250
premises with food we all have a sensory

692
00:29:40,250 --> 00:29:43,280
diet ways that yeah things that get us

693
00:29:43,280 --> 00:29:45,830
excited things that overwhelm us and

694
00:29:45,830 --> 00:29:48,890
things that calm us down and if all of

695
00:29:48,890 --> 00:29:51,470
us all of us we manage that quite

696
00:29:51,470 --> 00:29:53,270
naturally right now I've got my legs

697
00:29:53,270 --> 00:29:55,880
crossed you can't see below the table

698
00:29:55,880 --> 00:29:57,500
but I do and a lot of people when

699
00:29:57,500 --> 00:29:58,760
they're speaking on a panel will cross

700
00:29:58,760 --> 00:30:01,370
their legs or their cross their arms and

701
00:30:01,370 --> 00:30:03,380
that's actually giving them a kind of

702
00:30:03,380 --> 00:30:05,690
like a hug it's kind of giving

703
00:30:05,690 --> 00:30:08,120
themselves that sensory input to calm

704
00:30:08,120 --> 00:30:09,290
them down a lot of people do that

705
00:30:09,290 --> 00:30:11,750
subconsciously a lot of autistic people

706
00:30:11,750 --> 00:30:16,160
need additional help to address sound

707
00:30:16,160 --> 00:30:18,920
and and other senses or they need

708
00:30:18,920 --> 00:30:20,960
accommodations they need the lights

709
00:30:20,960 --> 00:30:23,600
turned off smells not to be seen near

710
00:30:23,600 --> 00:30:28,310
the cut the coffee machine and yeah my

711
00:30:28,310 --> 00:30:30,890
sister who is on the on the spectrum

712
00:30:30,890 --> 00:30:34,130
here I mentioned she reached over his

713
00:30:34,130 --> 00:30:37,400
noises and Sarah one of the developers

714
00:30:37,400 --> 00:30:39,230
that we work with Houston was with

715
00:30:39,230 --> 00:30:41,120
coffee smell so we just to make sure

716
00:30:41,120 --> 00:30:44,180
that we're not Norma's have our coffee

717
00:30:44,180 --> 00:30:47,210
lids off we're we're in the office it's

718
00:30:47,210 --> 00:30:48,940
all right today because I'm sitting here

719
00:30:48,940 --> 00:30:53,000
on my own socially isolating but when

720
00:30:53,000 --> 00:30:55,280
we're and the postcard time you know

721
00:30:55,280 --> 00:30:58,880
those things become yeah become

722
00:30:58,880 --> 00:31:02,080
particularly important again

723
00:31:03,900 --> 00:31:05,040
so what are some of the things that you

724
00:31:05,040 --> 00:31:06,690
can do I've mentioned some practical

725
00:31:06,690 --> 00:31:08,700
steps that we've done and what are

726
00:31:08,700 --> 00:31:11,250
specific barriers that you can remove in

727
00:31:11,250 --> 00:31:13,500
your workplace you know you might be a

728
00:31:13,500 --> 00:31:16,590
colleague of you might be part of a team

729
00:31:16,590 --> 00:31:18,630
you might be a manager you might be

730
00:31:18,630 --> 00:31:20,010
involved in recruitment you might be a

731
00:31:20,010 --> 00:31:22,230
CEO it depends on where you are in the

732
00:31:22,230 --> 00:31:25,590
company as to what you can do and you

733
00:31:25,590 --> 00:31:26,790
know I've got a picture here of someone

734
00:31:26,790 --> 00:31:29,760
in a wheelchair generally we know what

735
00:31:29,760 --> 00:31:31,680
about barriers are for people in a

736
00:31:31,680 --> 00:31:33,360
wheelchair you know adding in ramps

737
00:31:33,360 --> 00:31:35,250
making sure doorways are wide enough

738
00:31:35,250 --> 00:31:37,230
that they can fit through making sure

739
00:31:37,230 --> 00:31:39,600
that there are accessible bathrooms by

740
00:31:39,600 --> 00:31:41,370
autistic and neurodiverse people that

741
00:31:41,370 --> 00:31:43,500
barriers are still being understood

742
00:31:43,500 --> 00:31:46,560
there's still it was still all learning

743
00:31:46,560 --> 00:31:48,630
about them but there's still some things

744
00:31:48,630 --> 00:31:50,730
that we can learn and that can be

745
00:31:50,730 --> 00:31:53,820
changed right now one of them is the job

746
00:31:53,820 --> 00:31:56,130
interview so I mentioned some of the

747
00:31:56,130 --> 00:31:57,810
ways that we've changed job interviews

748
00:31:57,810 --> 00:32:00,750
to involve puzzles and that's one the

749
00:32:00,750 --> 00:32:02,880
biggest steps you can take think through

750
00:32:02,880 --> 00:32:04,800
this question are you assessing a

751
00:32:04,800 --> 00:32:09,330
person's skills or their ability to

752
00:32:09,330 --> 00:32:12,330
articulate those skills if so I'm really

753
00:32:12,330 --> 00:32:14,400
thanked us for those puzzles we do and

754
00:32:14,400 --> 00:32:15,750
they said wow finally some of that wants

755
00:32:15,750 --> 00:32:17,790
to understand my brain we rather than

756
00:32:17,790 --> 00:32:21,330
getting me to talk about my experience

757
00:32:21,330 --> 00:32:24,540
or lack of experience so yeah how can

758
00:32:24,540 --> 00:32:27,210
you think through how your company does

759
00:32:27,210 --> 00:32:29,430
you know do you get people to talk or do

760
00:32:29,430 --> 00:32:32,250
you get them to do work sample tests do

761
00:32:32,250 --> 00:32:33,960
you get them to do work sample tests in

762
00:32:33,960 --> 00:32:35,520
a really stressful environment you know

763
00:32:35,520 --> 00:32:37,620
coding up on the whiteboard or do you

764
00:32:37,620 --> 00:32:39,630
allow them space to do that do you allow

765
00:32:39,630 --> 00:32:41,810
them to go home and take those those

766
00:32:41,810 --> 00:32:45,450
exercises home and now yeah there are

767
00:32:45,450 --> 00:32:46,830
there are challenges every company we

768
00:32:46,830 --> 00:32:48,360
talk to says oh we can't do this because

769
00:32:48,360 --> 00:32:50,820
we've got to do things for everybody and

770
00:32:50,820 --> 00:32:53,670
yet we encourage them to think you know

771
00:32:53,670 --> 00:32:54,660
this is a group who is currently being

772
00:32:54,660 --> 00:32:57,210
missed out because of the the Box the

773
00:32:57,210 --> 00:32:59,820
lines that you draw so how about we go

774
00:32:59,820 --> 00:33:02,250
around the lines for a process some

775
00:33:02,250 --> 00:33:04,260
companies are willing to do that and

776
00:33:04,260 --> 00:33:06,450
then they start to see the the stars

777
00:33:06,450 --> 00:33:08,460
that the strengths of people that come

778
00:33:08,460 --> 00:33:13,230
through Microsoft is a company that's

779
00:33:13,230 --> 00:33:14,730
really understood this well they have a

780
00:33:14,730 --> 00:33:17,460
massive new a diverse

781
00:33:17,460 --> 00:33:20,070
program for hiring people and Jenny

782
00:33:20,070 --> 00:33:24,630
Leigh flurry she said that they

783
00:33:24,630 --> 00:33:26,070
discovered for them the problem was the

784
00:33:26,070 --> 00:33:27,750
interview and so they changed their

785
00:33:27,750 --> 00:33:29,760
approach to what the process should look

786
00:33:29,760 --> 00:33:31,710
like work with a local group to bring

787
00:33:31,710 --> 00:33:35,490
candidates in for a week-long program we

788
00:33:35,490 --> 00:33:37,740
offer teamwork and technical exercises

789
00:33:37,740 --> 00:33:39,390
and lots of training and they assess

790
00:33:39,390 --> 00:33:41,100
people as they train and they see how

791
00:33:41,100 --> 00:33:43,500
they learn how they step up and they get

792
00:33:43,500 --> 00:33:46,529
extra data and they you know may not be

793
00:33:46,529 --> 00:33:49,169
able to do a week long but even one or

794
00:33:49,169 --> 00:33:53,070
two days can help to slightly reduce the

795
00:33:53,070 --> 00:33:55,020
anxiety that someone feels in that kind

796
00:33:55,020 --> 00:33:57,659
of 1-hour stress for interview it gets a

797
00:33:57,659 --> 00:34:03,000
longer set of data into individuals so

798
00:34:03,000 --> 00:34:04,679
the interview think about how you do the

799
00:34:04,679 --> 00:34:06,960
interview secondly look more broadly at

800
00:34:06,960 --> 00:34:10,589
recruitment so that goes earlier than

801
00:34:10,589 --> 00:34:12,599
the job interview back to the job

802
00:34:12,599 --> 00:34:15,750
description how is the job description

803
00:34:15,750 --> 00:34:19,290
locking people out one way is to be more

804
00:34:19,290 --> 00:34:21,179
clearer in the job description about

805
00:34:21,179 --> 00:34:23,399
what are the exact requirements we had

806
00:34:23,399 --> 00:34:25,230
one investment bank in Sydney that said

807
00:34:25,230 --> 00:34:27,899
to us you've got to have candidates to

808
00:34:27,899 --> 00:34:31,080
have experience in it was power bi some

809
00:34:31,080 --> 00:34:33,060
analytics platform and they said or

810
00:34:33,060 --> 00:34:35,280
another they listed two and we said to

811
00:34:35,280 --> 00:34:36,989
them well what about if someone's done a

812
00:34:36,989 --> 00:34:38,940
third or four for a different one oh

813
00:34:38,940 --> 00:34:41,639
that's fine too okay so we adjusted it

814
00:34:41,639 --> 00:34:42,899
and then we said to them well how long

815
00:34:42,899 --> 00:34:44,520
did would it take to train someone in

816
00:34:44,520 --> 00:34:46,369
power bi if they've done none of these

817
00:34:46,369 --> 00:34:48,929
they said oh about two days if the

818
00:34:48,929 --> 00:34:51,899
person was a real whiz in Excel and then

819
00:34:51,899 --> 00:34:53,339
we asked well what does being whiz in

820
00:34:53,339 --> 00:34:55,050
excel mean our pivot tables

821
00:34:55,050 --> 00:34:56,760
yes it's asking these questions to get

822
00:34:56,760 --> 00:34:59,339
really clear what is essential what is a

823
00:34:59,339 --> 00:35:01,260
you know a nice to have that would put a

824
00:35:01,260 --> 00:35:03,089
candidate higher up the list and be

825
00:35:03,089 --> 00:35:04,710
really specific and we find that this

826
00:35:04,710 --> 00:35:07,380
clarity actually works for other types

827
00:35:07,380 --> 00:35:09,690
of groups that are returning to the

828
00:35:09,690 --> 00:35:10,230
workforce

829
00:35:10,230 --> 00:35:12,980
you know people from overseas people

830
00:35:12,980 --> 00:35:15,330
working mothers returning to work all

831
00:35:15,330 --> 00:35:17,369
different groups benefit from from this

832
00:35:17,369 --> 00:35:23,010
clarity and next third biggest thing is

833
00:35:23,010 --> 00:35:26,730
thinking about the sensory environment

834
00:35:26,730 --> 00:35:29,430
of the work this has really changed with

835
00:35:29,430 --> 00:35:30,840
people working from home

836
00:35:30,840 --> 00:35:33,000
because if you think about it your home

837
00:35:33,000 --> 00:35:35,340
is probably the in sensory environment

838
00:35:35,340 --> 00:35:37,260
that is most best set up for you

839
00:35:37,260 --> 00:35:39,770
yourself and the people you live with

840
00:35:39,770 --> 00:35:42,300
probably the people that best understand

841
00:35:42,300 --> 00:35:44,580
your own sensory diet your own sensory

842
00:35:44,580 --> 00:35:47,460
needs how you work as a person so yeah

843
00:35:47,460 --> 00:35:48,480
that's probably one of the reasons why

844
00:35:48,480 --> 00:35:50,970
so many of our group enjoy working from

845
00:35:50,970 --> 00:35:53,610
home but if you are asking people to

846
00:35:53,610 --> 00:35:55,620
come as the office for all or part of

847
00:35:55,620 --> 00:35:58,190
their time then think about the lighting

848
00:35:58,190 --> 00:36:01,080
the sounds allowing people to wear

849
00:36:01,080 --> 00:36:03,150
noise-cancelling headphones thinking

850
00:36:03,150 --> 00:36:06,390
about the smells of the bathrooms or the

851
00:36:06,390 --> 00:36:11,130
coffee machine the food areas I remember

852
00:36:11,130 --> 00:36:13,530
meeting the head of engineering for

853
00:36:13,530 --> 00:36:17,220
Google in Sydney and he said to me it's

854
00:36:17,220 --> 00:36:19,290
all very well I asked him advice about

855
00:36:19,290 --> 00:36:20,760
what Google's doing for interviews and

856
00:36:20,760 --> 00:36:22,380
he said that's great we want your help

857
00:36:22,380 --> 00:36:25,170
there but we also need help with the

858
00:36:25,170 --> 00:36:26,970
office environment we want to make sure

859
00:36:26,970 --> 00:36:27,720
that it works

860
00:36:27,720 --> 00:36:30,450
and so we've since done consulting work

861
00:36:30,450 --> 00:36:32,430
to help improve the Google office here

862
00:36:32,430 --> 00:36:35,190
in Sydney and have helped them to take

863
00:36:35,190 --> 00:36:37,350
steps to improve things and the amazing

864
00:36:37,350 --> 00:36:40,950
thing was one autistic engineer who

865
00:36:40,950 --> 00:36:43,290
works there you know said to me that he

866
00:36:43,290 --> 00:36:44,970
can't go in the cake before the we did

867
00:36:44,970 --> 00:36:46,560
that he couldn't go in the canteen

868
00:36:46,560 --> 00:36:47,670
because it was so noisy

869
00:36:47,670 --> 00:36:51,540
it was so such a sensory stressful

870
00:36:51,540 --> 00:36:55,800
environment and two of the non-autistic

871
00:36:55,800 --> 00:36:57,480
you know neurotypical people who were

872
00:36:57,480 --> 00:37:00,420
there they said to us actually I really

873
00:37:00,420 --> 00:37:01,770
struggle with the Google can't even the

874
00:37:01,770 --> 00:37:04,650
moment I find it overwhelming to so

875
00:37:04,650 --> 00:37:07,200
often what the steps that you take for

876
00:37:07,200 --> 00:37:09,570
this group will work will improve life

877
00:37:09,570 --> 00:37:13,590
improve work outcomes for everyone

878
00:37:13,590 --> 00:37:16,530
you're working with the one that acronym

879
00:37:16,530 --> 00:37:18,900
I want to really highlight there ATP I

880
00:37:18,900 --> 00:37:22,680
got this from a man that's made real

881
00:37:22,680 --> 00:37:25,530
pioneers with Walgreens in employing

882
00:37:25,530 --> 00:37:28,260
people disabilities he said ask the

883
00:37:28,260 --> 00:37:31,050
person you know ask each individual what

884
00:37:31,050 --> 00:37:33,960
works for them and that's just yeah such

885
00:37:33,960 --> 00:37:40,290
simple but profound advice and I want to

886
00:37:40,290 --> 00:37:41,520
leave a few minutes for questions I'm

887
00:37:41,520 --> 00:37:43,680
getting to the end of my time the final

888
00:37:43,680 --> 00:37:44,640
thing that I suggest is

889
00:37:44,640 --> 00:37:46,349
make sure each individual is set up for

890
00:37:46,349 --> 00:37:48,960
the right support structure and we like

891
00:37:48,960 --> 00:37:50,539
to think about a triangle of support

892
00:37:50,539 --> 00:37:53,630
people outside the workplace you know a

893
00:37:53,630 --> 00:37:57,000
job coat someone outside and then two

894
00:37:57,000 --> 00:37:58,589
people inside the workplace they're

895
00:37:58,589 --> 00:37:59,970
really providing that support structure

896
00:37:59,970 --> 00:38:02,430
you know the manager of each individual

897
00:38:02,430 --> 00:38:03,960
is the person that has the most

898
00:38:03,960 --> 00:38:06,900
potential that untapped potential to

899
00:38:06,900 --> 00:38:09,059
allow autistic people to enter and then

900
00:38:09,059 --> 00:38:12,269
really shine in the workforce but often

901
00:38:12,269 --> 00:38:13,799
you also need a buddy someone else

902
00:38:13,799 --> 00:38:15,809
outside your immediate work to have a

903
00:38:15,809 --> 00:38:17,609
sound ideas off and someone outside the

904
00:38:17,609 --> 00:38:19,920
company as well to provide that third

905
00:38:19,920 --> 00:38:23,400
leg of support so yeah these are some of

906
00:38:23,400 --> 00:38:26,609
the suggestions that I have and I'd love

907
00:38:26,609 --> 00:38:28,109
to you to reach out to me if you've got

908
00:38:28,109 --> 00:38:30,390
any questions and also let me know of

909
00:38:30,390 --> 00:38:34,200
examples of success examples that you

910
00:38:34,200 --> 00:38:37,890
know of neurodiverse or autistic people

911
00:38:37,890 --> 00:38:40,289
who are really shining and leading the

912
00:38:40,289 --> 00:38:43,559
way in doing amazing things in their in

913
00:38:43,559 --> 00:38:46,410
their work so yeah thank you very much

914
00:38:46,410 --> 00:38:49,859
for for having me along and yeah I think

915
00:38:49,859 --> 00:38:53,279
I will now open it up for questions if

916
00:38:53,279 --> 00:38:59,009
there are any to be asked hey Mike was a

917
00:38:59,009 --> 00:39:01,920
great session thank you for that thank

918
00:39:01,920 --> 00:39:04,859
you I did love the real-world stories

919
00:39:04,859 --> 00:39:06,750
and you had quite a few as well

920
00:39:06,750 --> 00:39:09,829
all of them with great social impact

921
00:39:09,829 --> 00:39:11,640
awesome yeah

922
00:39:11,640 --> 00:39:15,809
thank you for sure I uh I always say you

923
00:39:15,809 --> 00:39:17,250
know be the change you want to see in

924
00:39:17,250 --> 00:39:18,599
the world but it looks like you're

925
00:39:18,599 --> 00:39:21,690
taking this like ten steps forwards you

926
00:39:21,690 --> 00:39:24,119
know being a doing that you know 24/7

927
00:39:24,119 --> 00:39:25,680
for your job day-to-day that's pretty

928
00:39:25,680 --> 00:39:27,200
cool mm-hmm

929
00:39:27,200 --> 00:39:30,960
one question I do have is like how do

930
00:39:30,960 --> 00:39:33,720
people that are neurodiverse find out

931
00:39:33,720 --> 00:39:36,269
about you like is it is it an easy task

932
00:39:36,269 --> 00:39:39,029
to for them like to find out about it or

933
00:39:39,029 --> 00:39:40,410
it's like a hard one because maybe

934
00:39:40,410 --> 00:39:41,670
they're like like you said like maybe

935
00:39:41,670 --> 00:39:43,319
I've it's social distance so like they

936
00:39:43,319 --> 00:39:45,269
wouldn't know about it and you know they

937
00:39:45,269 --> 00:39:46,500
would probably be looking for those

938
00:39:46,500 --> 00:39:48,180
employment opportunities that you know

939
00:39:48,180 --> 00:39:49,440
thanks to your company an exceptional

940
00:39:49,440 --> 00:39:51,960
you can do that but like how do you how

941
00:39:51,960 --> 00:39:53,250
do you find people like finding out

942
00:39:53,250 --> 00:39:55,710
about you yeah good question I mean our

943
00:39:55,710 --> 00:39:57,809
website is definitely one way

944
00:39:57,809 --> 00:39:59,789
people could find out about us a lot of

945
00:39:59,789 --> 00:40:01,739
people that do come to us have heard

946
00:40:01,739 --> 00:40:05,099
through a friend you know they are yeah

947
00:40:05,099 --> 00:40:07,499
word of mouth is a real big big way of

948
00:40:07,499 --> 00:40:09,869
sharing you know when they've had

949
00:40:09,869 --> 00:40:11,579
success with someone helping them get a

950
00:40:11,579 --> 00:40:13,529
job they'll tell a friend and yes that

951
00:40:13,529 --> 00:40:16,170
word of mouth but yeah we're on on we've
