1
00:00:00,060 --> 00:00:02,850
hello everyone I'm gang Johnny and I'm

2
00:00:02,850 --> 00:00:04,200
here to talk to you today about deaf

3
00:00:04,200 --> 00:00:06,450
first security so the different view of

4
00:00:06,450 --> 00:00:09,389
how elusive approach security that tries

5
00:00:09,389 --> 00:00:11,160
to sort of focus more on the sort of you

6
00:00:11,160 --> 00:00:13,799
know modern development surrounding I'm

7
00:00:13,799 --> 00:00:15,690
going to share my perspective a little

8
00:00:15,690 --> 00:00:17,580
bit of a look at market stands as well

9
00:00:17,580 --> 00:00:20,070
as what is that for security but maybe

10
00:00:20,070 --> 00:00:21,600
more importantly I'll share a lot of

11
00:00:21,600 --> 00:00:23,189
specific practices from smart people

12
00:00:23,189 --> 00:00:25,230
that I have had the opportunity to talk

13
00:00:25,230 --> 00:00:27,510
to about how they tackle security inside

14
00:00:27,510 --> 00:00:28,949
their organization so we can learn from

15
00:00:28,949 --> 00:00:32,369
that we can share so a little bit about

16
00:00:32,369 --> 00:00:34,710
me I'm indeed camp attorney or guy

17
00:00:34,710 --> 00:00:37,170
bottoms from the twisters and the likes

18
00:00:37,170 --> 00:00:39,090
I'm the co-founder and president here at

19
00:00:39,090 --> 00:00:42,989
sneaked and before that I was sitting at

20
00:00:42,989 --> 00:00:45,750
my after after they acquired company I

21
00:00:45,750 --> 00:00:47,309
found its called blaze during that

22
00:00:47,309 --> 00:00:48,690
stretch I worked on what performance

23
00:00:48,690 --> 00:00:50,670
very much probably another aspect of so

24
00:00:50,670 --> 00:00:52,410
the world of DevOps and then prior to

25
00:00:52,410 --> 00:00:55,260
that I spent about a decade in OPSEC you

26
00:00:55,260 --> 00:00:56,520
could say before it was cool not sure if

27
00:00:56,520 --> 00:00:59,699
it's cool today but definitely you know

28
00:00:59,699 --> 00:01:01,170
kind of in its early days billing so

29
00:01:01,170 --> 00:01:05,400
first what security products I also you

30
00:01:05,400 --> 00:01:06,600
know do a decent amount of this little

31
00:01:06,600 --> 00:01:08,340
cocklebur public interactions you know I

32
00:01:08,340 --> 00:01:09,990
host the podcast that I'll refer to a

33
00:01:09,990 --> 00:01:12,119
decent amount here talking to smart

34
00:01:12,119 --> 00:01:14,340
people and trying to give them to share

35
00:01:14,340 --> 00:01:15,900
their security practices and I've

36
00:01:15,900 --> 00:01:17,159
written a bunch of books with the Reilly

37
00:01:17,159 --> 00:01:18,479
including two that you know there's

38
00:01:18,479 --> 00:01:20,700
links about you getting that you can get

39
00:01:20,700 --> 00:01:23,340
a free copy to them on the right around

40
00:01:23,340 --> 00:01:24,930
securing open source libraries and

41
00:01:24,930 --> 00:01:27,960
serverless security so with that let's

42
00:01:27,960 --> 00:01:30,180
dig into the the talk itself and gonna

43
00:01:30,180 --> 00:01:31,350
start with a word that not everybody

44
00:01:31,350 --> 00:01:33,840
likes which is digital transformation

45
00:01:33,840 --> 00:01:35,909
and then snow it's a buzzword and

46
00:01:35,909 --> 00:01:38,280
buzzwords can contain complexity but

47
00:01:38,280 --> 00:01:40,049
it's also a very real thing it's a

48
00:01:40,049 --> 00:01:44,670
change it's a big kind of wave of you

49
00:01:44,670 --> 00:01:46,860
know evolution revolution in how

50
00:01:46,860 --> 00:01:48,390
business has approached the world

51
00:01:48,390 --> 00:01:51,659
digital build software run them and and

52
00:01:51,659 --> 00:01:53,000
how we just operate our businesses

53
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:55,350
there's a lot of ways to slice and dice

54
00:01:55,350 --> 00:01:57,960
digital transformation and I'm going to

55
00:01:57,960 --> 00:02:00,960
use this split and say the digital

56
00:02:00,960 --> 00:02:03,869
digital transformation you know and at a

57
00:02:03,869 --> 00:02:06,689
very high level is composed of three big

58
00:02:06,689 --> 00:02:09,538
buckets one is more software the second

59
00:02:09,538 --> 00:02:11,280
is cloud technologies a difference of

60
00:02:11,280 --> 00:02:13,470
foundation of technology on which

61
00:02:13,470 --> 00:02:15,960
patience run which interact very closely

62
00:02:15,960 --> 00:02:17,460
with a different set of methodologies

63
00:02:17,460 --> 00:02:19,110
which I'll refer to as DevOps instead

64
00:02:19,110 --> 00:02:21,630
office fully appreciative that again

65
00:02:21,630 --> 00:02:23,730
this is there's a lot of ways to sort of

66
00:02:23,730 --> 00:02:25,830
look at digital transformation so what

67
00:02:25,830 --> 00:02:26,880
I'm gonna do is I'm going to dig into

68
00:02:26,880 --> 00:02:28,860
each one of these three in the context

69
00:02:28,860 --> 00:02:30,510
of security and and see how they affect

70
00:02:30,510 --> 00:02:36,540
it and so more software simply put

71
00:02:36,540 --> 00:02:38,910
equals more software risk and I'm not

72
00:02:38,910 --> 00:02:40,320
gonna belabor this point too much but

73
00:02:40,320 --> 00:02:42,960
really as businesses get digital is more

74
00:02:42,960 --> 00:02:45,540
of your you know your business of your

75
00:02:45,540 --> 00:02:47,400
revenue of your operation you know goes

76
00:02:47,400 --> 00:02:50,580
online and goes digital then then really

77
00:02:50,580 --> 00:02:52,740
more of your risk more if your data more

78
00:02:52,740 --> 00:02:54,990
your revenue risk all of those become

79
00:02:54,990 --> 00:02:57,150
digital as well this is a quote from a

80
00:02:57,150 --> 00:02:59,880
James Kaplan who heads these cyber

81
00:02:59,880 --> 00:03:02,880
security practice for McKinsey and he

82
00:03:02,880 --> 00:03:05,130
has you know he was on the podcast and

83
00:03:05,130 --> 00:03:07,380
he has this great blog post as well

84
00:03:07,380 --> 00:03:09,870
about how securities the the linchpin

85
00:03:09,870 --> 00:03:11,070
cyber security is the linchpin of

86
00:03:11,070 --> 00:03:12,990
digital transformation but specifically

87
00:03:12,990 --> 00:03:14,940
points out quite simply it's safe for

88
00:03:14,940 --> 00:03:16,140
many companies cyber security is

89
00:03:16,140 --> 00:03:17,730
increasingly a critical business issue

90
00:03:17,730 --> 00:03:19,950
not just a technology issue and even

91
00:03:19,950 --> 00:03:21,690
points out you know this reference to C

92
00:03:21,690 --> 00:03:24,330
so conversation that he had but hedge

93
00:03:24,330 --> 00:03:25,830
funds didn't really use to care about

94
00:03:25,830 --> 00:03:27,330
cybersecurity for instance and now

95
00:03:27,330 --> 00:03:28,590
they're obsessed with it just as one

96
00:03:28,590 --> 00:03:31,260
example of many so not gonna belabor

97
00:03:31,260 --> 00:03:32,760
this point too much definitely not a

98
00:03:32,760 --> 00:03:36,660
technical point but but just to say you

99
00:03:36,660 --> 00:03:38,040
know from many businesses if you live in

100
00:03:38,040 --> 00:03:39,090
the technology world this might be

101
00:03:39,090 --> 00:03:41,010
obvious that the tech is at the center

102
00:03:41,010 --> 00:03:42,570
but from any business says it's this

103
00:03:42,570 --> 00:03:44,340
shift of you know what is the chief

104
00:03:44,340 --> 00:03:46,830
security officer focused on from maybe

105
00:03:46,830 --> 00:03:50,010
more physical security or other aspects

106
00:03:50,010 --> 00:03:52,410
to more and more being related to

107
00:03:52,410 --> 00:03:55,830
software risk getting a bit more

108
00:03:55,830 --> 00:03:59,550
technical the the second kind of aspect

109
00:03:59,550 --> 00:04:04,170
of cyber security is cloud and cloud

110
00:04:04,170 --> 00:04:05,640
there was a lot of you can say about the

111
00:04:05,640 --> 00:04:08,010
security of cloud you know you can talk

112
00:04:08,010 --> 00:04:09,450
about how its new technology and every

113
00:04:09,450 --> 00:04:11,610
new technology introduces some risks you

114
00:04:11,610 --> 00:04:13,019
can talk about how it's less mature and

115
00:04:13,019 --> 00:04:17,579
it embraced a bit more quickly maybe and

116
00:04:17,579 --> 00:04:19,290
then its security kind of aspects have

117
00:04:19,290 --> 00:04:21,089
been researched or just about the sort

118
00:04:21,089 --> 00:04:22,530
of the network perimeter change but a

119
00:04:22,530 --> 00:04:24,030
datacenter is something that is posted

120
00:04:24,030 --> 00:04:26,220
online but what I think is more

121
00:04:26,220 --> 00:04:27,389
interesting is that

122
00:04:27,389 --> 00:04:29,930
changes the scope of the application

123
00:04:29,930 --> 00:04:33,330
let's dig into what I mean by that so in

124
00:04:33,330 --> 00:04:35,430
the pre cloudier I again using a little

125
00:04:35,430 --> 00:04:36,810
bit of black and white terms in the pre

126
00:04:36,810 --> 00:04:38,639
cloudy rap you have this sort of heavy

127
00:04:38,639 --> 00:04:40,979
IT stack on which applications are built

128
00:04:40,979 --> 00:04:42,479
you know there's some hardware

129
00:04:42,479 --> 00:04:44,129
management maybe some colossal data

130
00:04:44,129 --> 00:04:46,259
centers some VMs of vSphere running

131
00:04:46,259 --> 00:04:48,930
you've got some Cisco routers managing

132
00:04:48,930 --> 00:04:53,069
these network access or is open some BMS

133
00:04:53,069 --> 00:04:55,229
an Oracle database and singing on side

134
00:04:55,229 --> 00:04:56,340
and then you have some code in some

135
00:04:56,340 --> 00:04:58,139
libraries and if the app teams want to

136
00:04:58,139 --> 00:04:59,400
engage with this sort of you know

137
00:04:59,400 --> 00:05:01,680
central IT stack then you know they open

138
00:05:01,680 --> 00:05:03,509
tickets there you know you asked for

139
00:05:03,509 --> 00:05:05,900
some provisioning of some components and

140
00:05:05,900 --> 00:05:09,180
and you interact and it's owned by teams

141
00:05:09,180 --> 00:05:11,280
that are relatively central and they

142
00:05:11,280 --> 00:05:14,039
manage those components in the cloud

143
00:05:14,039 --> 00:05:16,770
surrounding the layers remain mostly the

144
00:05:16,770 --> 00:05:18,150
same you still into control network

145
00:05:18,150 --> 00:05:19,710
access it's still going to manage the OS

146
00:05:19,710 --> 00:05:21,779
it's still need a database but suddenly

147
00:05:21,779 --> 00:05:24,779
those might be you know a BBC on AWS

148
00:05:24,779 --> 00:05:26,460
they might be a container that manages

149
00:05:26,460 --> 00:05:29,879
that is that of OS and needs to be

150
00:05:29,879 --> 00:05:34,409
patched it might be you know a cloud

151
00:05:34,409 --> 00:05:36,690
database service that you are using or

152
00:05:36,690 --> 00:05:37,860
maybe some more would it be that you

153
00:05:37,860 --> 00:05:39,779
should have pulled in and so the

154
00:05:39,779 --> 00:05:42,240
components are are there the

155
00:05:42,240 --> 00:05:44,639
functionality is still there but the way

156
00:05:44,639 --> 00:05:46,080
that these things are pulled is very

157
00:05:46,080 --> 00:05:48,000
different you know now instead of being

158
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:49,889
managed by the centralized hateem there

159
00:05:49,889 --> 00:05:51,629
are part of the application they get

160
00:05:51,629 --> 00:05:54,389
deployed and they are packaged up in the

161
00:05:54,389 --> 00:05:56,129
same in the same area and same

162
00:05:56,129 --> 00:05:57,629
repository through the same built

163
00:05:57,629 --> 00:05:59,729
pipeline as the code and the libraries

164
00:05:59,729 --> 00:06:01,349
of the application itself that's very

165
00:06:01,349 --> 00:06:03,539
significant because it means where are

166
00:06:03,539 --> 00:06:05,699
the decision where the decisions are

167
00:06:05,699 --> 00:06:07,469
made that impact these securities and

168
00:06:07,469 --> 00:06:09,719
where the solutions needs to be placed

169
00:06:09,719 --> 00:06:12,000
to help tackle security concerns with

170
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:13,800
each of these layers is different it

171
00:06:13,800 --> 00:06:15,990
needs to go from IT security to

172
00:06:15,990 --> 00:06:18,449
application security and and just to say

173
00:06:18,449 --> 00:06:19,889
that this trend will continue like this

174
00:06:19,889 --> 00:06:22,139
this motion of going into the app is

175
00:06:22,139 --> 00:06:23,789
more and more and it's break it's on

176
00:06:23,789 --> 00:06:25,169
DevOps we'll talk about that in a sec

177
00:06:25,169 --> 00:06:27,150
but you know you can see data you can

178
00:06:27,150 --> 00:06:30,240
see CDM I've seen a lot in Akamai you

179
00:06:30,240 --> 00:06:31,949
know the API gateways or the use of

180
00:06:31,949 --> 00:06:33,270
third-party services whether in the

181
00:06:33,270 --> 00:06:34,949
cloud or otherwise all these are

182
00:06:34,949 --> 00:06:37,380
becoming part of the app they're

183
00:06:37,380 --> 00:06:38,880
packaged up into one unit one

184
00:06:38,880 --> 00:06:40,710
self-sufficient

185
00:06:40,710 --> 00:06:43,229
package that controls a lot of these

186
00:06:43,229 --> 00:06:45,449
different aspects and and helps them you

187
00:06:45,449 --> 00:06:48,210
know running a missive uniform you know

188
00:06:48,210 --> 00:06:51,210
synchronization and so for security

189
00:06:51,210 --> 00:06:52,350
that's very important we need to think

190
00:06:52,350 --> 00:06:55,410
about IT security solutions and the IT

191
00:06:55,410 --> 00:06:58,889
person central IT person in each unit to

192
00:06:58,889 --> 00:07:01,560
tackle them two more apps I oriented

193
00:07:01,560 --> 00:07:03,600
solutions you know and that need to be

194
00:07:03,600 --> 00:07:04,949
addressed as part of the development

195
00:07:04,949 --> 00:07:08,250
workflow and then last but very much not

196
00:07:08,250 --> 00:07:12,020
least is DevOps and you know DevOps is

197
00:07:12,020 --> 00:07:14,430
it's a it's a big thing again you can

198
00:07:14,430 --> 00:07:16,320
define it in many ways but it predicates

199
00:07:16,320 --> 00:07:18,060
a lot on these two core principles that

200
00:07:18,060 --> 00:07:20,130
are very related one is continuous

201
00:07:20,130 --> 00:07:21,780
processes continuous integration can be

202
00:07:21,780 --> 00:07:24,539
a delivery no no slow down no manual a

203
00:07:24,539 --> 00:07:26,820
non-stop for a manual process and then

204
00:07:26,820 --> 00:07:28,350
the second is these empowered

205
00:07:28,350 --> 00:07:30,570
self-sufficient teams that can do all of

206
00:07:30,570 --> 00:07:32,490
that that you know they own that journey

207
00:07:32,490 --> 00:07:34,169
end to end which you know very much

208
00:07:34,169 --> 00:07:35,400
relates to what I talked about with the

209
00:07:35,400 --> 00:07:37,260
cloud scope so they also control the

210
00:07:37,260 --> 00:07:38,610
scaling of their system the network

211
00:07:38,610 --> 00:07:40,710
access of that system the data of their

212
00:07:40,710 --> 00:07:43,470
systems etc so they can tighten that

213
00:07:43,470 --> 00:07:46,289
loop know from writing a lot of codes to

214
00:07:46,289 --> 00:07:47,789
getting it to the market you know to

215
00:07:47,789 --> 00:07:49,620
provide value to learning from it and

216
00:07:49,620 --> 00:07:54,599
back again and so with all of these

217
00:07:54,599 --> 00:07:57,030
changes security for the most part

218
00:07:57,030 --> 00:07:59,130
hasn't kind of moved with the times it's

219
00:07:59,130 --> 00:08:01,710
left behind security traditionally and

220
00:08:01,710 --> 00:08:03,930
still very much today is done in this

221
00:08:03,930 --> 00:08:05,400
type of element even if it's inside a

222
00:08:05,400 --> 00:08:07,590
circle not an infinity loop it's done in

223
00:08:07,590 --> 00:08:09,630
a way that is about gating it's about

224
00:08:09,630 --> 00:08:12,150
stopping stop here I will do a security

225
00:08:12,150 --> 00:08:14,849
review I will audit you know those are

226
00:08:14,849 --> 00:08:16,919
done by team they're outside and it's

227
00:08:16,919 --> 00:08:19,590
very very much counter to the way all of

228
00:08:19,590 --> 00:08:21,389
these other activities are being done so

229
00:08:21,389 --> 00:08:22,770
the motion to the change that were

230
00:08:22,770 --> 00:08:24,210
applying and it creates a bunch of

231
00:08:24,210 --> 00:08:27,599
problems first security teams are in the

232
00:08:27,599 --> 00:08:29,070
critical path so they're slowing things

233
00:08:29,070 --> 00:08:31,770
down they're not continuous and that

234
00:08:31,770 --> 00:08:33,150
implies they're going against the

235
00:08:33,150 --> 00:08:35,549
business motion they are slowing things

236
00:08:35,549 --> 00:08:38,400
down which which just naturally

237
00:08:38,400 --> 00:08:39,958
conflicts with what everybody else is

238
00:08:39,958 --> 00:08:43,229
trying to do second and related is that

239
00:08:43,229 --> 00:08:45,089
the security teams are siloed they're

240
00:08:45,089 --> 00:08:47,459
outside of where the core decisions are

241
00:08:47,459 --> 00:08:48,720
being made so they always need to be

242
00:08:48,720 --> 00:08:50,310
chasing decisions that have been made

243
00:08:50,310 --> 00:08:51,480
they don't have the right information

244
00:08:51,480 --> 00:08:53,430
they're being worked around or not

245
00:08:53,430 --> 00:08:54,450
pulled in

246
00:08:54,450 --> 00:08:55,950
when they should be and that results in

247
00:08:55,950 --> 00:08:58,070
just poor security just insecure

248
00:08:58,070 --> 00:09:01,140
applications being shipped and to make

249
00:09:01,140 --> 00:09:02,250
all of these things worse

250
00:09:02,250 --> 00:09:04,440
Security's understaffed and it and it's

251
00:09:04,440 --> 00:09:05,520
understaffed not just because

252
00:09:05,520 --> 00:09:07,200
organizations are under investing in it

253
00:09:07,200 --> 00:09:08,400
but rather because there's this big

254
00:09:08,400 --> 00:09:10,500
talent shortage of 50 percent of jobs

255
00:09:10,500 --> 00:09:12,840
remain unfilled and so even if you were

256
00:09:12,840 --> 00:09:14,340
to sort of splurge and want to hire a

257
00:09:14,340 --> 00:09:16,920
very big security team you can't there's

258
00:09:16,920 --> 00:09:18,240
just not enough people for you to hire

259
00:09:18,240 --> 00:09:21,810
and so there's this it's a challenge

260
00:09:21,810 --> 00:09:23,730
security security practices haven't

261
00:09:23,730 --> 00:09:25,890
changed nearly as much as you know these

262
00:09:25,890 --> 00:09:28,650
other aspects of our technology stack so

263
00:09:28,650 --> 00:09:30,390
what I would propose and again show some

264
00:09:30,390 --> 00:09:31,680
examples of leaders and how they've

265
00:09:31,680 --> 00:09:34,170
applied it is a different mindset to it

266
00:09:34,170 --> 00:09:36,420
think about security from a developer

267
00:09:36,420 --> 00:09:38,550
first perspective and what does this

268
00:09:38,550 --> 00:09:40,950
mean when you say developer first in the

269
00:09:40,950 --> 00:09:42,720
world of security most people

270
00:09:42,720 --> 00:09:44,880
immediately say shift left they think

271
00:09:44,880 --> 00:09:46,680
about shift left shift is this notion it

272
00:09:46,680 --> 00:09:48,270
comes from the waterfall mindset it

273
00:09:48,270 --> 00:09:49,710
comes from the fact that there's you

274
00:09:49,710 --> 00:09:51,810
know a start and an end to the

275
00:09:51,810 --> 00:09:53,550
development process and shifting left is

276
00:09:53,550 --> 00:09:55,320
earlier in the timeline and it's a good

277
00:09:55,320 --> 00:09:56,790
thing you know like she flux is a good

278
00:09:56,790 --> 00:09:58,110
thing you want to find issues earlier

279
00:09:58,110 --> 00:10:00,210
and address them before they become

280
00:10:00,210 --> 00:10:02,640
bigger it's cheaper it is more secure

281
00:10:02,640 --> 00:10:05,670
but when you develop in a continuous

282
00:10:05,670 --> 00:10:07,110
fashion in this sort of infinity loop

283
00:10:07,110 --> 00:10:09,480
type model where he's left you know it's

284
00:10:09,480 --> 00:10:10,620
it's not really left it's about

285
00:10:10,620 --> 00:10:12,030
continuous it's about that sort of

286
00:10:12,030 --> 00:10:13,950
constant attraction you know you can say

287
00:10:13,950 --> 00:10:15,600
that developers have expanded to the

288
00:10:15,600 --> 00:10:17,160
right so at the very least it's expand

289
00:10:17,160 --> 00:10:20,160
left versus shift left um but really if

290
00:10:20,160 --> 00:10:21,540
you're going to choose the direction you

291
00:10:21,540 --> 00:10:23,970
know in my mind that change is top to

292
00:10:23,970 --> 00:10:26,450
bottom it's about changing ownership

293
00:10:26,450 --> 00:10:28,980
from being this sort of controlling

294
00:10:28,980 --> 00:10:30,810
entity that's more difficult to toriel

295
00:10:30,810 --> 00:10:32,100
and kind of tells everybody what to do

296
00:10:32,100 --> 00:10:34,440
to more of a bottom-up approach with the

297
00:10:34,440 --> 00:10:36,060
relevant governance capabilities and

298
00:10:36,060 --> 00:10:38,520
this requires changes on both sides on

299
00:10:38,520 --> 00:10:40,290
the development side it requires some

300
00:10:40,290 --> 00:10:41,820
empowerment by the organization of

301
00:10:41,820 --> 00:10:45,480
developers to to to have the ownership

302
00:10:45,480 --> 00:10:48,090
to tackle some of these security

303
00:10:48,090 --> 00:10:50,640
responsibilities and to equip that those

304
00:10:50,640 --> 00:10:53,190
teams with with the tooling right with

305
00:10:53,190 --> 00:10:54,750
the ability to actually tackle it well

306
00:10:54,750 --> 00:10:56,820
and of course development the

307
00:10:56,820 --> 00:10:58,890
development teams need to step up in the

308
00:10:58,890 --> 00:11:01,290
onus responsibility on the security side

309
00:11:01,290 --> 00:11:03,120
you need to shift that mindset and go

310
00:11:03,120 --> 00:11:05,070
from more of a controlling entity to

311
00:11:05,070 --> 00:11:07,020
more of a supportive entity whose job

312
00:11:07,020 --> 00:11:07,890
isn't to

313
00:11:07,890 --> 00:11:09,750
find the problems understand the

314
00:11:09,750 --> 00:11:12,089
problems but rather to allow or help

315
00:11:12,089 --> 00:11:14,700
depth find the problems and understand

316
00:11:14,700 --> 00:11:16,170
the problems and act on the problems and

317
00:11:16,170 --> 00:11:17,459
that their focus is more about

318
00:11:17,459 --> 00:11:20,399
governance and that tooling providers so

319
00:11:20,399 --> 00:11:21,660
what we'll do now is we'll dig into each

320
00:11:21,660 --> 00:11:23,160
of these sort of empower developers and

321
00:11:23,160 --> 00:11:24,300
supportive security teams and talk a

322
00:11:24,300 --> 00:11:25,890
little bit about some examples it's not

323
00:11:25,890 --> 00:11:27,870
a comprehensive list of how can you

324
00:11:27,870 --> 00:11:30,690
achieve this how can you help empower

325
00:11:30,690 --> 00:11:32,490
developers and how can you help

326
00:11:32,490 --> 00:11:34,560
transform security to be more of a

327
00:11:34,560 --> 00:11:37,529
supportive security team let's start

328
00:11:37,529 --> 00:11:38,820
with empower developers and I'll try to

329
00:11:38,820 --> 00:11:41,070
weave in some examples from from those

330
00:11:41,070 --> 00:11:44,910
specific leaders so the first step to

331
00:11:44,910 --> 00:11:46,500
empower developers is to remember that

332
00:11:46,500 --> 00:11:48,420
you need to be building tools that look

333
00:11:48,420 --> 00:11:52,079
like the tools that they use are that

334
00:11:52,079 --> 00:11:54,420
are designed that feel to them like

335
00:11:54,420 --> 00:11:56,640
developer tools not like security tools

336
00:11:56,640 --> 00:11:57,930
that I've been to chop down their

337
00:11:57,930 --> 00:12:00,779
throats and very much like a very big

338
00:12:00,779 --> 00:12:03,060
component of that is to allow self-serve

339
00:12:03,060 --> 00:12:06,269
usage that is successful and it's there

340
00:12:06,269 --> 00:12:08,160
very few security companies you start to

341
00:12:08,160 --> 00:12:09,690
think about very very few security

342
00:12:09,690 --> 00:12:11,490
companies that offer self-serve

343
00:12:11,490 --> 00:12:13,620
solutions let alone self-serve solutions

344
00:12:13,620 --> 00:12:16,320
for developers and they assume a lot of

345
00:12:16,320 --> 00:12:18,029
knowledge and they're just not designed

346
00:12:18,029 --> 00:12:19,440
for that security is it governance

347
00:12:19,440 --> 00:12:21,149
competency it's oftentimes sort of

348
00:12:21,149 --> 00:12:23,130
something that's fairly broad across the

349
00:12:23,130 --> 00:12:26,610
organization and so it's not where

350
00:12:26,610 --> 00:12:28,350
companies have invested but for

351
00:12:28,350 --> 00:12:29,940
developers that's very very significant

352
00:12:29,940 --> 00:12:31,649
they want to be able to start with

353
00:12:31,649 --> 00:12:34,440
something try it out see it work within

354
00:12:34,440 --> 00:12:36,149
their surroundings and some security

355
00:12:36,149 --> 00:12:37,709
companies do this very well you know

356
00:12:37,709 --> 00:12:39,690
hashable fault is a great example has

357
00:12:39,690 --> 00:12:41,490
great onboarding great self-serve

358
00:12:41,490 --> 00:12:43,800
capabilities of zero which is very

359
00:12:43,800 --> 00:12:45,750
security affiliated also does a great

360
00:12:45,750 --> 00:12:47,310
job with some great documentation that

361
00:12:47,310 --> 00:12:48,990
allows also you have to think whether

362
00:12:48,990 --> 00:12:51,260
you're building the steps of tooling

363
00:12:51,260 --> 00:12:53,760
like whether you're a vendor providing

364
00:12:53,760 --> 00:12:55,199
these types of solutions to others or

365
00:12:55,199 --> 00:12:56,490
whether you're building these tools for

366
00:12:56,490 --> 00:12:58,199
your internal consumption you have to

367
00:12:58,199 --> 00:13:00,089
think about how do you enable developers

368
00:13:00,089 --> 00:13:01,649
within the org or within the ecosystem

369
00:13:01,649 --> 00:13:03,959
to self sort of try that out and it's

370
00:13:03,959 --> 00:13:05,640
really a predicate is hard to think of

371
00:13:05,640 --> 00:13:08,490
many successful developer tools that

372
00:13:08,490 --> 00:13:10,709
permeated the ecosystem that do not have

373
00:13:10,709 --> 00:13:14,029
a self-serve usage

374
00:13:14,570 --> 00:13:17,960
the second you know the aspect that

375
00:13:17,960 --> 00:13:20,630
might feel obvious is to think about the

376
00:13:20,630 --> 00:13:22,520
problem from a developer's eyes and

377
00:13:22,520 --> 00:13:24,620
understand how a vulnerability made it

378
00:13:24,620 --> 00:13:26,710
in when you when you look at security

379
00:13:26,710 --> 00:13:28,610
generally solutions have been built for

380
00:13:28,610 --> 00:13:31,880
security auditors so their view is that

381
00:13:31,880 --> 00:13:33,200
when you think about the big picture

382
00:13:33,200 --> 00:13:36,080
view you think about consolidating the

383
00:13:36,080 --> 00:13:37,460
same security risk across many

384
00:13:37,460 --> 00:13:39,890
applications for a developer that's not

385
00:13:39,890 --> 00:13:41,150
the big picture of you the big picture

386
00:13:41,150 --> 00:13:43,430
view is my application and all its

387
00:13:43,430 --> 00:13:45,470
different facets so I know that I pulled

388
00:13:45,470 --> 00:13:46,820
in these libraries they know that I have

389
00:13:46,820 --> 00:13:48,710
these performance aspects I know that it

390
00:13:48,710 --> 00:13:50,810
has this functionality aspect and I want

391
00:13:50,810 --> 00:13:52,220
to know there are security aspects

392
00:13:52,220 --> 00:13:54,500
within the context of my application

393
00:13:54,500 --> 00:13:56,240
within the context of the actions that

394
00:13:56,240 --> 00:13:58,220
I've made that have all these

395
00:13:58,220 --> 00:14:00,830
implications you know security being one

396
00:14:00,830 --> 00:14:03,770
of them and so this how you do this

397
00:14:03,770 --> 00:14:06,440
depends on the vulnerability itself for

398
00:14:06,440 --> 00:14:07,970
the security threat you're tackling and

399
00:14:07,970 --> 00:14:09,530
the world of dependencies you know one

400
00:14:09,530 --> 00:14:10,790
thing we found to be very helpful is

401
00:14:10,790 --> 00:14:12,800
this notion of the dependency tree so in

402
00:14:12,800 --> 00:14:14,480
this example I could say you use five

403
00:14:14,480 --> 00:14:16,160
libraries and these two are honorable

404
00:14:16,160 --> 00:14:17,900
but it's much more productive for a

405
00:14:17,900 --> 00:14:19,490
developer if I say well you're used to

406
00:14:19,490 --> 00:14:21,710
libraries bjs locals and air handler and

407
00:14:21,710 --> 00:14:23,900
they pulled in these other libraries

408
00:14:23,900 --> 00:14:25,730
that are vulnerable it makes it's much

409
00:14:25,730 --> 00:14:27,710
easier to understand how does this

410
00:14:27,710 --> 00:14:31,130
relate to my app similar example is in

411
00:14:31,130 --> 00:14:32,630
code you know I think this is maybe one

412
00:14:32,630 --> 00:14:34,070
of the ones that has been done a little

413
00:14:34,070 --> 00:14:35,510
bit better in the role of security which

414
00:14:35,510 --> 00:14:37,580
is to show you in this land of codes

415
00:14:37,580 --> 00:14:39,740
this is the problem this is a simple one

416
00:14:39,740 --> 00:14:41,210
but oftentimes you also want to explain

417
00:14:41,210 --> 00:14:45,590
what is the sequence of dataflow steps

418
00:14:45,590 --> 00:14:48,620
that you've seen that allow a malicious

419
00:14:48,620 --> 00:14:50,330
inputs together some vulnerable saying

420
00:14:50,330 --> 00:14:52,070
anyone to show that vulnerability within

421
00:14:52,070 --> 00:14:53,630
the conflicts with your code here your

422
00:14:53,630 --> 00:14:57,920
code had this flaw over here and when

423
00:14:57,920 --> 00:14:59,420
you think about the broader scope of the

424
00:14:59,420 --> 00:15:01,070
app as we talked about for the cloud the

425
00:15:01,070 --> 00:15:03,830
same concept applies to your code in the

426
00:15:03,830 --> 00:15:05,810
context of say containers you know in

427
00:15:05,810 --> 00:15:07,490
containers you can you should separate

428
00:15:07,490 --> 00:15:09,290
for instance for developers it's a very

429
00:15:09,290 --> 00:15:10,910
big deal that separates the base image

430
00:15:10,910 --> 00:15:14,060
from what is inside the docker file it's

431
00:15:14,060 --> 00:15:15,590
very different if owner abilities in the

432
00:15:15,590 --> 00:15:16,940
base image you want to address it very

433
00:15:16,940 --> 00:15:18,080
differently you would swap the base

434
00:15:18,080 --> 00:15:20,660
image you wouldn't fix the point problem

435
00:15:20,660 --> 00:15:23,720
that has been outlined versus if it's in

436
00:15:23,720 --> 00:15:25,220
the docker file you know that that's

437
00:15:25,220 --> 00:15:27,020
kind of your code that's the code that's

438
00:15:27,020 --> 00:15:28,110
written for Europe

439
00:15:28,110 --> 00:15:30,330
and then you want to be able just like

440
00:15:30,330 --> 00:15:31,950
in that line of code to point to that

441
00:15:31,950 --> 00:15:34,260
line of code said well here's the run

442
00:15:34,260 --> 00:15:37,560
command inside your father's so think

443
00:15:37,560 --> 00:15:38,700
about problems from an application

444
00:15:38,700 --> 00:15:41,930
context from a developer point of view

445
00:15:41,930 --> 00:15:45,180
another like a great practice that I've

446
00:15:45,180 --> 00:15:48,030
really loved in the same vein you know

447
00:15:48,030 --> 00:15:49,920
comes from from segment so segments you

448
00:15:49,920 --> 00:15:51,120
know they have a lot of really really

449
00:15:51,120 --> 00:15:53,700
smart practices one things they do is

450
00:15:53,700 --> 00:15:56,460
they have this training where you know

451
00:15:56,460 --> 00:15:57,780
they have a two-part training for a new

452
00:15:57,780 --> 00:15:59,730
developer one of them is this thinking

453
00:15:59,730 --> 00:16:02,100
like an attacker and in that practice

454
00:16:02,100 --> 00:16:04,080
every example they use is one of a

455
00:16:04,080 --> 00:16:05,280
vulnerability that was actually

456
00:16:05,280 --> 00:16:07,500
previously in segments reported

457
00:16:07,500 --> 00:16:10,320
otherwise found and what they found you

458
00:16:10,320 --> 00:16:11,550
know as I highlight here is that it's a

459
00:16:11,550 --> 00:16:13,290
lot easier to get developers to care

460
00:16:13,290 --> 00:16:14,970
right to relate to this vulnerability

461
00:16:14,970 --> 00:16:16,440
when it's a feature that you're familiar

462
00:16:16,440 --> 00:16:18,570
with it's a world words it's your

463
00:16:18,570 --> 00:16:21,270
context it's your code so I love this

464
00:16:21,270 --> 00:16:22,830
practice it requires a bit more work of

465
00:16:22,830 --> 00:16:24,840
course but you know it's just turned

466
00:16:24,840 --> 00:16:25,950
these vulnerabilities into great

467
00:16:25,950 --> 00:16:29,990
educational tools my highly recommended

468
00:16:30,990 --> 00:16:32,730
for example all of us are for examples

469
00:16:32,730 --> 00:16:34,620
in the silver and power development side

470
00:16:34,620 --> 00:16:37,230
is to remember the developers don't have

471
00:16:37,230 --> 00:16:39,740
the same level of security expertise as

472
00:16:39,740 --> 00:16:42,270
the security person so you want to

473
00:16:42,270 --> 00:16:44,730
provide not just the answers but also

474
00:16:44,730 --> 00:16:47,339
security questions no you want to guide

475
00:16:47,339 --> 00:16:49,380
the developer to say this is what's

476
00:16:49,380 --> 00:16:51,860
important from a security perspective

477
00:16:51,860 --> 00:16:54,630
for you to even probe you know for you

478
00:16:54,630 --> 00:16:56,850
to ask that question and I'll give a

479
00:16:56,850 --> 00:16:58,920
couple of examples here one is Pedro

480
00:16:58,920 --> 00:17:00,240
duty so Pedro Duty can be used for

481
00:17:00,240 --> 00:17:01,350
Incident Response as a whole and

482
00:17:01,350 --> 00:17:02,880
specifically for security incidents as

483
00:17:02,880 --> 00:17:04,709
well it has good capabilities and they

484
00:17:04,709 --> 00:17:08,069
did this great job writing down what is

485
00:17:08,069 --> 00:17:09,869
a security incident and what are the

486
00:17:09,869 --> 00:17:11,369
steps you should do and clearly this is

487
00:17:11,369 --> 00:17:12,780
the template and it can and should be

488
00:17:12,780 --> 00:17:14,250
customized for different organisations

489
00:17:14,250 --> 00:17:16,140
but I love the hand-holding is to say

490
00:17:16,140 --> 00:17:18,270
this is what is a security incidents

491
00:17:18,270 --> 00:17:19,920
these are the questions that you need to

492
00:17:19,920 --> 00:17:22,020
do this is the sequence of steps that

493
00:17:22,020 --> 00:17:23,369
you should do it should cut the attack

494
00:17:23,369 --> 00:17:24,630
factor you know cut off the attack

495
00:17:24,630 --> 00:17:26,339
vector that's the most important thing

496
00:17:26,339 --> 00:17:28,109
you can't expect developers you can

497
00:17:28,109 --> 00:17:29,970
expect developers to take responsibility

498
00:17:29,970 --> 00:17:32,970
to note it to act on it but you can't

499
00:17:32,970 --> 00:17:34,770
expect them to become security experts

500
00:17:34,770 --> 00:17:37,230
the tooling has to embody that type of

501
00:17:37,230 --> 00:17:40,830
expertise in our world in the world of

502
00:17:40,830 --> 00:17:42,059
snake we see this a lot around

503
00:17:42,059 --> 00:17:43,559
properties of vulnerabilities there are

504
00:17:43,559 --> 00:17:45,000
a lot of vulnerabilities you know

505
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:47,010
unfortunately use a lot of open source

506
00:17:47,010 --> 00:17:48,570
and these these are pieces of software

507
00:17:48,570 --> 00:17:51,090
they have bugs including security bugs

508
00:17:51,090 --> 00:17:53,910
known as vulnerabilities and so when you

509
00:17:53,910 --> 00:17:55,890
have too many of them how do you help

510
00:17:55,890 --> 00:17:57,929
developers deal with that faster and

511
00:17:57,929 --> 00:17:59,910
examples of that are so saying for

512
00:17:59,910 --> 00:18:02,010
instance is there an expert in the wild

513
00:18:02,010 --> 00:18:03,960
and what should you ask about that

514
00:18:03,960 --> 00:18:05,820
expert is in binary well no there's a

515
00:18:05,820 --> 00:18:08,309
maturity element so say ok there is an

516
00:18:08,309 --> 00:18:09,240
expert in the wild for this

517
00:18:09,240 --> 00:18:11,340
vulnerability and it is mature so you

518
00:18:11,340 --> 00:18:13,440
should ask them it emergency or when you

519
00:18:13,440 --> 00:18:14,429
talk about a component

520
00:18:14,429 --> 00:18:16,860
help understand where is the

521
00:18:16,860 --> 00:18:18,360
vulnerability above and beyond what is

522
00:18:18,360 --> 00:18:19,950
the vulnerability which all tools do

523
00:18:19,950 --> 00:18:21,420
it's like this is across that scripting

524
00:18:21,420 --> 00:18:24,059
this is an SQL injection tell me where

525
00:18:24,059 --> 00:18:26,400
in the functionality of this component

526
00:18:26,400 --> 00:18:29,070
is the vulnerability and that makes it

527
00:18:29,070 --> 00:18:31,170
much easier to understand it to relate

528
00:18:31,170 --> 00:18:34,650
to my application so all those are just

529
00:18:34,650 --> 00:18:36,870
think about the security expertise you

530
00:18:36,870 --> 00:18:39,530
want to embed

531
00:18:40,210 --> 00:18:41,860
then the last bid I have as an example

532
00:18:41,860 --> 00:18:45,520
here is his remediation and a simple

533
00:18:45,520 --> 00:18:47,410
statement is a developer's job isn't to

534
00:18:47,410 --> 00:18:49,590
find issues it's to fix them and

535
00:18:49,590 --> 00:18:51,850
arguably an auditors job well they

536
00:18:51,850 --> 00:18:53,530
should care about fixing is define the

537
00:18:53,530 --> 00:18:54,640
issues and then they pass it on to

538
00:18:54,640 --> 00:18:56,800
development to fix that they can fix it

539
00:18:56,800 --> 00:18:59,890
themselves and so as a developer you

540
00:18:59,890 --> 00:19:02,380
have like if you as a if you're trying

541
00:19:02,380 --> 00:19:04,660
to get security solutions that

542
00:19:04,660 --> 00:19:06,190
developers will embrace you have to

543
00:19:06,190 --> 00:19:07,810
think about their full journey you have

544
00:19:07,810 --> 00:19:09,670
to think about how do you get them all

545
00:19:09,670 --> 00:19:13,570
the way to remediation and there are a

546
00:19:13,570 --> 00:19:15,160
lot of examples for it I think and think

547
00:19:15,160 --> 00:19:16,810
we're fairly well known around this sort

548
00:19:16,810 --> 00:19:18,670
of open fix they are you know trying to

549
00:19:18,670 --> 00:19:21,220
kind of help um I told you about a

550
00:19:21,220 --> 00:19:22,900
problem and I'll also package it out

551
00:19:22,900 --> 00:19:24,610
into a pull request it's how you can fix

552
00:19:24,610 --> 00:19:25,900
it and now a bunch of other schools are

553
00:19:25,900 --> 00:19:27,760
are mimicking this functionality which I

554
00:19:27,760 --> 00:19:29,950
can help help simplify this you see that

555
00:19:29,950 --> 00:19:31,720
sort of merge advice around telling you

556
00:19:31,720 --> 00:19:32,920
whether it's likely that this would

557
00:19:32,920 --> 00:19:34,480
break it or not that's all about making

558
00:19:34,480 --> 00:19:35,860
this upgrade would break your

559
00:19:35,860 --> 00:19:37,600
application or not you know it's all

560
00:19:37,600 --> 00:19:39,450
about making it easy for you to upgrade

561
00:19:39,450 --> 00:19:42,070
another cool example I've seen recently

562
00:19:42,070 --> 00:19:43,600
sometimes you can't auto fix it but

563
00:19:43,600 --> 00:19:45,790
still help support to that fix examples

564
00:19:45,790 --> 00:19:47,050
this is an example from school called

565
00:19:47,050 --> 00:19:48,400
deep code which is not actually security

566
00:19:48,400 --> 00:19:51,160
focused but when they talk about problem

567
00:19:51,160 --> 00:19:53,710
they show examples of how how it's been

568
00:19:53,710 --> 00:19:55,420
fixed in other repositories so that's

569
00:19:55,420 --> 00:19:56,620
pretty cool as well it's all about

570
00:19:56,620 --> 00:20:00,690
helping your bring me pH maturity and

571
00:20:00,690 --> 00:20:03,640
this is a great example internally when

572
00:20:03,640 --> 00:20:05,170
you think about that remediation which

573
00:20:05,170 --> 00:20:06,970
is you know Tulio has like many

574
00:20:06,970 --> 00:20:09,160
organizations they maintain centrally

575
00:20:09,160 --> 00:20:11,740
these internal golden images golden base

576
00:20:11,740 --> 00:20:13,540
images for containers but they've seen

577
00:20:13,540 --> 00:20:15,070
that that developers you know they need

578
00:20:15,070 --> 00:20:17,410
help knowing when to pull them in and

579
00:20:17,410 --> 00:20:18,790
pulling in the new versions of those

580
00:20:18,790 --> 00:20:21,490
images get released and so what they've

581
00:20:21,490 --> 00:20:22,780
done is they've created an automated

582
00:20:22,780 --> 00:20:25,330
tools that it creates pull requests to

583
00:20:25,330 --> 00:20:26,890
update those from statements in the

584
00:20:26,890 --> 00:20:28,600
docker and they've seen that despite the

585
00:20:28,600 --> 00:20:29,770
fact that I haven't done any internal

586
00:20:29,770 --> 00:20:31,570
promotions because this is quite recent

587
00:20:31,570 --> 00:20:35,500
and the community changed through

588
00:20:35,500 --> 00:20:38,800
attention around two-thirds of these PRS

589
00:20:38,800 --> 00:20:41,740
have been acted on and so you know I

590
00:20:41,740 --> 00:20:44,470
love Josh because Roger like he has

591
00:20:44,470 --> 00:20:46,630
broad security over there and I loved

592
00:20:46,630 --> 00:20:48,640
his his comment says you make the tasks

593
00:20:48,640 --> 00:20:50,620
as simple as possible they do the right

594
00:20:50,620 --> 00:20:54,270
thing you really simplify

595
00:20:54,530 --> 00:20:56,640
so this is one side of the fence right

596
00:20:56,640 --> 00:20:58,590
it's about empowering developers there's

597
00:20:58,590 --> 00:21:00,150
much more you can do around it but just

598
00:21:00,150 --> 00:21:01,470
think like eye developer think about

599
00:21:01,470 --> 00:21:03,240
what you would want on the other side

600
00:21:03,240 --> 00:21:05,100
with security team we need to think

601
00:21:05,100 --> 00:21:06,780
about how do we need to adapt the

602
00:21:06,780 --> 00:21:10,230
security practices and so the first and

603
00:21:10,230 --> 00:21:13,290
big change is aligning the organization

604
00:21:13,290 --> 00:21:14,700
to it security organizations have

605
00:21:14,700 --> 00:21:16,770
generally been aligned to IT org

606
00:21:16,770 --> 00:21:19,350
for the most part because that was the

607
00:21:19,350 --> 00:21:20,970
group that was addressing security so

608
00:21:20,970 --> 00:21:22,020
you want to think about how do you want

609
00:21:22,020 --> 00:21:25,140
to adapt it to the development and the

610
00:21:25,140 --> 00:21:27,360
DevOps organizations have this sort of

611
00:21:27,360 --> 00:21:28,920
simple diagram here where you have dev

612
00:21:28,920 --> 00:21:30,510
dev is aligned to develop some one side

613
00:21:30,510 --> 00:21:32,220
into Apps on the other side then you

614
00:21:32,220 --> 00:21:33,600
have cloud security where does that fit

615
00:21:33,600 --> 00:21:35,040
you know some of it is aligned to DevOps

616
00:21:35,040 --> 00:21:37,080
some of it is aligned to app stack in

617
00:21:37,080 --> 00:21:38,880
its nature of this activities from its

618
00:21:38,880 --> 00:21:41,040
own thing so you want to think about

619
00:21:41,040 --> 00:21:43,140
this a little bit more I would say that

620
00:21:43,140 --> 00:21:44,580
you know this type of change comes in

621
00:21:44,580 --> 00:21:46,530
three core levels there's an

622
00:21:46,530 --> 00:21:48,270
organizational change literally who does

623
00:21:48,270 --> 00:21:50,600
the system report to other people

624
00:21:50,600 --> 00:21:52,980
business there's a skill set change you

625
00:21:52,980 --> 00:21:54,000
know what do you need what are the

626
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:56,250
competencies that you needed members of

627
00:21:56,250 --> 00:21:58,890
the security team with this problem and

628
00:21:58,890 --> 00:22:01,110
and mindset change that's again that's

629
00:22:01,110 --> 00:22:03,330
sort of controlling entity into a

630
00:22:03,330 --> 00:22:05,820
supportive entity that's a big deal let

631
00:22:05,820 --> 00:22:07,260
me show three examples from different

632
00:22:07,260 --> 00:22:09,720
companies on these three items so

633
00:22:09,720 --> 00:22:11,430
organizational change a great example is

634
00:22:11,430 --> 00:22:13,980
what envision does so envision and this

635
00:22:13,980 --> 00:22:15,600
was from a conversation with Sarah Donna

636
00:22:15,600 --> 00:22:18,180
there's an outside person over there is

637
00:22:18,180 --> 00:22:20,310
the you know they have an absolute

638
00:22:20,310 --> 00:22:23,820
person that is aligned to a preset list

639
00:22:23,820 --> 00:22:26,970
of development teams and I think at this

640
00:22:26,970 --> 00:22:28,710
point the ratio is about one to ten I'm

641
00:22:28,710 --> 00:22:31,320
not entirely sure but what what that

642
00:22:31,320 --> 00:22:33,660
allows them to do is that it gives the

643
00:22:33,660 --> 00:22:37,050
app site person an ability to learn the

644
00:22:37,050 --> 00:22:39,540
domain of those specific applications to

645
00:22:39,540 --> 00:22:42,660
participate in the stand-ups to to

646
00:22:42,660 --> 00:22:44,940
create that bond and it gives the dev

647
00:22:44,940 --> 00:22:48,060
teams a very clear person to talk to to

648
00:22:48,060 --> 00:22:49,410
build that relationship and to go to

649
00:22:49,410 --> 00:22:51,480
when they have a security question or

650
00:22:51,480 --> 00:22:53,310
security need so I love that pairing

651
00:22:53,310 --> 00:22:54,900
it's basically mimicking with finance

652
00:22:54,900 --> 00:22:58,130
and HR 20

653
00:22:58,530 --> 00:23:00,850
so so that's a good example and by the

654
00:23:00,850 --> 00:23:01,810
way like for each of these examples

655
00:23:01,810 --> 00:23:03,280
there's a whole bunch of other companies

656
00:23:03,280 --> 00:23:05,500
that I've spoken to that repeats these

657
00:23:05,500 --> 00:23:06,790
practices and I'm just sort of showing

658
00:23:06,790 --> 00:23:10,240
you one example the second thing is

659
00:23:10,240 --> 00:23:12,730
about skill set and actually before I

660
00:23:12,730 --> 00:23:14,770
talk about Justin's coming here even you

661
00:23:14,770 --> 00:23:15,820
know Yash that I've just mentioned

662
00:23:15,820 --> 00:23:17,860
before from from Twilio talks about how

663
00:23:17,860 --> 00:23:19,900
he likes within his team everybody to at

664
00:23:19,900 --> 00:23:21,700
least be able to empathize the

665
00:23:21,700 --> 00:23:24,280
development and so needs to be able to

666
00:23:24,280 --> 00:23:26,170
code a little bit you know so that was

667
00:23:26,170 --> 00:23:28,330
one example pretty much every security

668
00:23:28,330 --> 00:23:30,400
leader today hiring highlights that

669
00:23:30,400 --> 00:23:32,590
importance and Justins mania was a very

670
00:23:32,590 --> 00:23:34,540
experienced security officer across many

671
00:23:34,540 --> 00:23:37,600
companies he expects this to be a big

672
00:23:37,600 --> 00:23:39,700
shift in the skill set within the world

673
00:23:39,700 --> 00:23:41,200
of security says I would say security

674
00:23:41,200 --> 00:23:43,090
team staff will rotate about 1/3 maybe

675
00:23:43,090 --> 00:23:45,220
half for more of a process management

676
00:23:45,220 --> 00:23:46,840
mindset that is being done today

677
00:23:46,840 --> 00:23:49,540
generally into developers it points out

678
00:23:49,540 --> 00:23:50,860
that you know what does that do to the

679
00:23:50,860 --> 00:23:52,770
secure to work for us that's a big

680
00:23:52,770 --> 00:23:55,540
rockin you know into it do you need to

681
00:23:55,540 --> 00:23:57,520
lay off people and hire different people

682
00:23:57,520 --> 00:23:59,950
rollin Cloutier who's a CISO of

683
00:23:59,950 --> 00:24:02,410
tick-tock today it was at ADP when I

684
00:24:02,410 --> 00:24:04,180
spoke to him ADP he did this big

685
00:24:04,180 --> 00:24:06,340
training exercise he invested he put a

686
00:24:06,340 --> 00:24:09,010
plan in place through a skill or you

687
00:24:09,010 --> 00:24:11,410
know up level in the relevant skills his

688
00:24:11,410 --> 00:24:14,200
reorganization and is done you know very

689
00:24:14,200 --> 00:24:15,550
good job kind of retaining and growing

690
00:24:15,550 --> 00:24:17,860
that talent but you should know to know

691
00:24:17,860 --> 00:24:19,150
his justice says that this is a big

692
00:24:19,150 --> 00:24:20,830
thing this is a big impact that will

693
00:24:20,830 --> 00:24:23,470
take years to shift and evolve into it

694
00:24:23,470 --> 00:24:24,610
so you have to think about the skills

695
00:24:24,610 --> 00:24:28,360
that you need in that team and then last

696
00:24:28,360 --> 00:24:29,860
but not least you know the mindset

697
00:24:29,860 --> 00:24:31,210
change and you know I love Kelly

698
00:24:31,210 --> 00:24:32,740
Shortridge is just brilliant you know

699
00:24:32,740 --> 00:24:34,870
she's a security analyst and she's she's

700
00:24:34,870 --> 00:24:36,790
a victory product in strategy at capsule

701
00:24:36,790 --> 00:24:39,580
8 and she she talks a lot about DevOps

702
00:24:39,580 --> 00:24:41,800
and security and you know one of her

703
00:24:41,800 --> 00:24:43,570
comments says that the wait bill Act she

704
00:24:43,570 --> 00:24:44,980
likes to refer to the relationship

705
00:24:44,980 --> 00:24:46,870
between DevOps and security today's that

706
00:24:46,870 --> 00:24:48,310
they're frenemies and I love that term

707
00:24:48,310 --> 00:24:51,340
but really that inevitably these two

708
00:24:51,340 --> 00:24:52,840
groups are going to need to partner

709
00:24:52,840 --> 00:24:54,520
together and ideally this isn't an

710
00:24:54,520 --> 00:24:56,830
antagonistic relationship so it's a mind

711
00:24:56,830 --> 00:24:58,030
to the change that bills from I'm

712
00:24:58,030 --> 00:24:59,200
telling you what to do to and

713
00:24:59,200 --> 00:25:03,120
collaborate with you to get that done

714
00:25:03,280 --> 00:25:06,400
so those were big changes that are at

715
00:25:06,400 --> 00:25:09,610
the core to core practices one paved

716
00:25:09,610 --> 00:25:12,280
road so making security easy using the

717
00:25:12,280 --> 00:25:14,440
pavement road is is a concept that I

718
00:25:14,440 --> 00:25:16,440
think came from on Netflix these are two

719
00:25:16,440 --> 00:25:18,430
presentations explaining what is the

720
00:25:18,430 --> 00:25:19,510
paved road which is not just the

721
00:25:19,510 --> 00:25:21,670
security concept coming from from a

722
00:25:21,670 --> 00:25:24,670
diamond Marsh as a presentation from

723
00:25:24,670 --> 00:25:27,040
Netflix and you know I'll just kind of

724
00:25:27,040 --> 00:25:28,630
quote her because I think she did define

725
00:25:28,630 --> 00:25:31,060
this pretty well since first the paved

726
00:25:31,060 --> 00:25:33,190
road is a concept formalizing the set of

727
00:25:33,190 --> 00:25:34,780
expectations and commitments between the

728
00:25:34,780 --> 00:25:36,490
centralized teams and our engineering

729
00:25:36,490 --> 00:25:38,650
customers when we talk about security

730
00:25:38,650 --> 00:25:40,600
what does it mean to be secure what are

731
00:25:40,600 --> 00:25:42,700
the practices that you actually should

732
00:25:42,700 --> 00:25:45,400
be doing to get security down right and

733
00:25:45,400 --> 00:25:48,070
the second is technology that makes that

734
00:25:48,070 --> 00:25:50,380
specific set of activities easy in a

735
00:25:50,380 --> 00:25:51,670
specific surrounding so it's a well

736
00:25:51,670 --> 00:25:53,440
integrated supported machinery to enable

737
00:25:53,440 --> 00:25:54,940
engineers to focus on delivering the

738
00:25:54,940 --> 00:25:57,370
porn business value and to socialize the

739
00:25:57,370 --> 00:25:59,230
centralized can support so basically

740
00:25:59,230 --> 00:26:01,050
it's a specific path where there's a

741
00:26:01,050 --> 00:26:03,400
platform that already does a bunch of

742
00:26:03,400 --> 00:26:04,870
the things that you need to do very

743
00:26:04,870 --> 00:26:07,540
easily you know very well for you so it

744
00:26:07,540 --> 00:26:09,220
makes it easy for you to stay on that

745
00:26:09,220 --> 00:26:12,040
route and so this approach is good for a

746
00:26:12,040 --> 00:26:13,810
lot of other sort of DevOps technologies

747
00:26:13,810 --> 00:26:16,600
and it wasn't created for security but I

748
00:26:16,600 --> 00:26:17,980
had a chance to talk to Jason Chen who

749
00:26:17,980 --> 00:26:19,990
is the VP InfoSec there at Netflix and

750
00:26:19,990 --> 00:26:22,150
you know they use that same concept for

751
00:26:22,150 --> 00:26:23,650
security as well right so he says we

752
00:26:23,650 --> 00:26:25,750
call that growth and I loved his terms

753
00:26:25,750 --> 00:26:27,580
as you certainly you can separately

754
00:26:27,580 --> 00:26:29,260
bushwhack and make your way through the

755
00:26:29,260 --> 00:26:31,540
woods but if you have this sort of nice

756
00:26:31,540 --> 00:26:33,040
smooth paved road that gets you to the

757
00:26:33,040 --> 00:26:34,840
station you're likely to opt in there so

758
00:26:34,840 --> 00:26:37,660
it's about making it easy to make the

759
00:26:37,660 --> 00:26:39,640
right decision and they do have that

760
00:26:39,640 --> 00:26:42,100
freedom of responsibility and so even

761
00:26:42,100 --> 00:26:44,740
individual decides you know if it's team

762
00:26:44,740 --> 00:26:46,990
decides to go who to AK you know and can

763
00:26:46,990 --> 00:26:49,930
go off-road then they become responsible

764
00:26:49,930 --> 00:26:52,690
for the concepts that are a part of that

765
00:26:52,690 --> 00:26:54,310
paper out of what does it mean to be

766
00:26:54,310 --> 00:26:56,500
secure so big Road I think is a very

767
00:26:56,500 --> 00:26:59,050
powerful way to empower teams but still

768
00:26:59,050 --> 00:27:00,730
trying to coalesce them towards the

769
00:27:00,730 --> 00:27:04,480
right path and then last I'm very much

770
00:27:04,480 --> 00:27:06,760
lost not least as a computer practice

771
00:27:06,760 --> 00:27:08,380
that I mentioned is this celebrating

772
00:27:08,380 --> 00:27:11,410
security success and it's amazing how

773
00:27:11,410 --> 00:27:12,910
often it comes up in these successful

774
00:27:12,910 --> 00:27:13,929
security leaders

775
00:27:13,929 --> 00:27:15,429
I'll use this example for exact powers

776
00:27:15,429 --> 00:27:16,600
at one medical

777
00:27:16,600 --> 00:27:18,490
says he refers to his experience at

778
00:27:18,490 --> 00:27:20,410
Salesforce as well and I'll just kind of

779
00:27:20,410 --> 00:27:21,670
read it out a little bit so I think

780
00:27:21,670 --> 00:27:22,150
that's great

781
00:27:22,150 --> 00:27:23,560
it sails first we definitely tried a

782
00:27:23,560 --> 00:27:25,960
range of positive incentives at which

783
00:27:25,960 --> 00:27:28,210
he's carried on to one medical it says

784
00:27:28,210 --> 00:27:30,040
someone is as simple as high-fiving

785
00:27:30,040 --> 00:27:31,210
somebody for doing the right thing a

786
00:27:31,210 --> 00:27:32,440
little bit hardness of Corona

787
00:27:32,440 --> 00:27:35,020
surrounding but still like this notion

788
00:27:35,020 --> 00:27:36,910
of just acknowledging that somebody did

789
00:27:36,910 --> 00:27:39,060
something well already goes a long way

790
00:27:39,060 --> 00:27:42,010
and part of it is just like small

791
00:27:42,010 --> 00:27:44,110
incentives for bragging rights and you

792
00:27:44,110 --> 00:27:45,220
know we have this whole conversation

793
00:27:45,220 --> 00:27:46,510
about how everybody loves swag and

794
00:27:46,510 --> 00:27:49,000
around you know who did driven security

795
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:50,500
and you know they actually invest a fair

796
00:27:50,500 --> 00:27:52,270
bit at keeping it keeping it fresh

797
00:27:52,270 --> 00:27:54,340
around those but what he points out is

798
00:27:54,340 --> 00:27:56,250
that if you empower software engineers

799
00:27:56,250 --> 00:27:58,780
then and you kind of ask them to and

800
00:27:58,780 --> 00:28:00,670
expect them to sort of make decisions

801
00:28:00,670 --> 00:28:02,590
then recognizing them for their a good

802
00:28:02,590 --> 00:28:04,510
decision and good work is a very very

803
00:28:04,510 --> 00:28:06,820
important and produces great results far

804
00:28:06,820 --> 00:28:10,510
more than the steep approach this came

805
00:28:10,510 --> 00:28:12,550
up in a lot of different conversations

806
00:28:12,550 --> 00:28:15,190
I've had on the podcast but you know one

807
00:28:15,190 --> 00:28:18,010
that really kind of grew especially fond

808
00:28:18,010 --> 00:28:20,470
of is from a duo that's now part Cisco

809
00:28:20,470 --> 00:28:21,880
and Mike Handley was the head of

810
00:28:21,880 --> 00:28:23,770
security there talked about how they

811
00:28:23,770 --> 00:28:25,480
actually built they automated a little

812
00:28:25,480 --> 00:28:26,980
recognition BOTS so they have this

813
00:28:26,980 --> 00:28:29,260
friendly neighborhood security bot on

814
00:28:29,260 --> 00:28:31,570
that term that goes off and reaches out

815
00:28:31,570 --> 00:28:33,550
to people and just sort of thanks them

816
00:28:33,550 --> 00:28:35,590
for making good security decisions so it

817
00:28:35,590 --> 00:28:36,970
could be that they updated their phone

818
00:28:36,970 --> 00:28:38,650
to the latest release and done that you

819
00:28:38,650 --> 00:28:39,880
know it's one of the first few people

820
00:28:39,880 --> 00:28:41,590
and they just acknowledge it it could be

821
00:28:41,590 --> 00:28:43,390
just a thank you it could be spot

822
00:28:43,390 --> 00:28:46,300
bonuses to people and split bonuses to

823
00:28:46,300 --> 00:28:48,280
people you know just raising their hand

824
00:28:48,280 --> 00:28:49,510
and saying hey there's a security issue

825
00:28:49,510 --> 00:28:51,220
here so when people do the right thing

826
00:28:51,220 --> 00:28:53,020
just investing in internationally

827
00:28:53,020 --> 00:28:56,290
building it um just for the absence of

828
00:28:56,290 --> 00:28:57,550
doubt you know I called a lot of smart

829
00:28:57,550 --> 00:28:59,110
people here I do provide value as well

830
00:28:59,110 --> 00:29:00,610
when we're in those podcast you know for

831
00:29:00,610 --> 00:29:01,960
instance in this conversation with Mike

832
00:29:01,960 --> 00:29:04,690
you went on to talk about how you know

833
00:29:04,690 --> 00:29:08,440
even little things get rewarded and that

834
00:29:08,440 --> 00:29:10,960
they have a set of these stickers you

835
00:29:10,960 --> 00:29:12,490
know special kind of edition of sticker

836
00:29:12,490 --> 00:29:14,140
that says they were the first to report

837
00:29:14,140 --> 00:29:15,520
a phishing attack or something that they

838
00:29:15,520 --> 00:29:17,350
give and I contributed a lot of value

839
00:29:17,350 --> 00:29:19,000
saying that's awesome I think any good

840
00:29:19,000 --> 00:29:20,380
rewarding system should definitely fall

841
00:29:20,380 --> 00:29:22,480
speakers so it's a lot of ways those

842
00:29:22,480 --> 00:29:24,549
words

843
00:29:24,549 --> 00:29:27,799
so to wrap up you know digital

844
00:29:27,799 --> 00:29:29,119
transformation that's happening right

845
00:29:29,119 --> 00:29:30,649
and whether you like the buzzword or not

846
00:29:30,649 --> 00:29:32,960
that change is very real and security

847
00:29:32,960 --> 00:29:35,029
practices haven't evolved anywhere near

848
00:29:35,029 --> 00:29:37,999
as fast so we need to do something about

849
00:29:37,999 --> 00:29:41,179
that and what I would propose here is

850
00:29:41,179 --> 00:29:42,860
that we need to transform security to be

851
00:29:42,860 --> 00:29:45,259
dead first you know to think about how

852
00:29:45,259 --> 00:29:48,529
that development teams needs to be

853
00:29:48,529 --> 00:29:50,090
making decisions you know we expect them

854
00:29:50,090 --> 00:29:51,440
to make a decision and to be autonomous

855
00:29:51,440 --> 00:29:52,940
and that everything should revolve

856
00:29:52,940 --> 00:29:54,679
around that it should start from that

857
00:29:54,679 --> 00:29:56,450
point and then we figure out how do we

858
00:29:56,450 --> 00:29:59,240
achieve it and I'd like to leave you

859
00:29:59,240 --> 00:30:00,980
with one more quote from a versatile

860
00:30:00,980 --> 00:30:02,509
person you know that I had the chance to

861
00:30:02,509 --> 00:30:04,249
have a podcast and that's Adrian Ludwig

862
00:30:04,249 --> 00:30:07,279
who is the audacity and seaso and he has

863
00:30:07,279 --> 00:30:10,399
this very broad kind of big picture and

864
00:30:10,399 --> 00:30:12,710
he read out his code which I liked he

865
00:30:12,710 --> 00:30:14,179
said that you know when we you worked at

866
00:30:14,179 --> 00:30:15,889
Google you know he got the call from

867
00:30:15,889 --> 00:30:17,210
them and they talked about Android is

868
00:30:17,210 --> 00:30:18,919
coming up strong and they need to figure

869
00:30:18,919 --> 00:30:20,990
out security and that was a seminal

870
00:30:20,990 --> 00:30:22,669
moment for him because it was through

871
00:30:22,669 --> 00:30:23,929
that mobile was an opportunity to

872
00:30:23,929 --> 00:30:27,470
rethink reset how we go about security

873
00:30:27,470 --> 00:30:29,029
and when you think about how good mobile

874
00:30:29,029 --> 00:30:31,490
security is compared to you know desktop

875
00:30:31,490 --> 00:30:34,070
security windows ecosystem likes it's

876
00:30:34,070 --> 00:30:35,869
night and day it's much much much better

877
00:30:35,869 --> 00:30:37,639
and he points out that the shift to

878
00:30:37,639 --> 00:30:39,769
cloud is a similar fundamental shift for

879
00:30:39,769 --> 00:30:42,200
companies so it's a chance for us to

880
00:30:42,200 --> 00:30:44,240
rethink what is possible

881
00:30:44,240 --> 00:30:45,529
so I love that you know it's an

882
00:30:45,529 --> 00:30:47,480
opportunity for us to to think about

883
00:30:47,480 --> 00:30:49,700
something that is different and again I

884
00:30:49,700 --> 00:30:51,440
would posit that a start for that is the

885
00:30:51,440 --> 00:30:53,149
step for security approach focused on

886
00:30:53,149 --> 00:30:55,190
empowered developers and a supportive

887
00:30:55,190 --> 00:30:57,320
security team that aligns this digital

888
00:30:57,320 --> 00:31:00,110
transformation landscape that's for free

889
00:31:00,110 --> 00:31:06,110
thank you awesome thank you very very

890
00:31:06,110 --> 00:31:08,539
much going in fact we have the man

891
00:31:08,539 --> 00:31:10,549
himself here hey guy how's it going

892
00:31:10,549 --> 00:31:13,330
doing well how are you

893
00:31:13,330 --> 00:31:15,710
yeah doing very very well and I'm black

894
00:31:15,710 --> 00:31:17,710
I'm glad that you've set up your room

895
00:31:17,710 --> 00:31:21,980
exactly as in the video tell of hanging

896
00:31:21,980 --> 00:31:23,450
something on my board about the

897
00:31:23,450 --> 00:31:25,190
cognitive dissonance you know really of

898
00:31:25,190 --> 00:31:27,139
like you know sort of the discomfort of

899
00:31:27,139 --> 00:31:29,720
yeah I can guarantee everyone having

900
00:31:29,720 --> 00:31:31,610
worked with guy as well this isn't this

901
00:31:31,610 --> 00:31:33,559
isn't just a zoom background that this

902
00:31:33,559 --> 00:31:35,560
is this is your this is your

903
00:31:35,560 --> 00:31:43,190
it is weird you know that hung up

904
00:31:43,190 --> 00:31:44,840
exactly as it was in the video and

905
00:31:44,840 --> 00:31:46,970
everything so thank you guys for a great

906
00:31:46,970 --> 00:31:50,140
great session people in chat very very

907
00:31:50,140 --> 00:31:52,100
really liked the idea of that

908
00:31:52,100 --> 00:31:54,890
empowerment rather than that kind of

909
00:31:54,890 --> 00:31:56,450
shift left and people recognized it's

910
00:31:56,450 --> 00:31:58,520
obviously you know more than just a

911
00:31:58,520 --> 00:32:00,740
shift left I've asked a question

912
00:32:00,740 --> 00:32:02,500
actually in terms of in terms of this

913
00:32:02,500 --> 00:32:05,780
empowerment you showed that that image

914
00:32:05,780 --> 00:32:08,240
where the dev you know more and more is

915
00:32:08,240 --> 00:32:09,890
looking like it's actually being wrapped

916
00:32:09,890 --> 00:32:11,510
up into the application and less and

917
00:32:11,510 --> 00:32:13,600
less is kind of on that more traditional

918
00:32:13,600 --> 00:32:16,490
upside how does that how does that

919
00:32:16,490 --> 00:32:18,590
obviously we have that balance on 100

920
00:32:18,590 --> 00:32:20,810
devs 210 opted to one security which

921
00:32:20,810 --> 00:32:23,270
we're all very familiar with what kind

922
00:32:23,270 --> 00:32:25,130
of impact does that have on that ratio

923
00:32:25,130 --> 00:32:27,110
is it exacerbate that even further if

924
00:32:27,110 --> 00:32:29,270
more is being pushed to empower the

925
00:32:29,270 --> 00:32:31,310
developers what what do you feel yeah I

926
00:32:31,310 --> 00:32:32,690
mean it's a good question

927
00:32:32,690 --> 00:32:34,370
I think there's kind of two flavors to

928
00:32:34,370 --> 00:32:37,940
it you know one is is the ratio itself

929
00:32:37,940 --> 00:32:40,190
so like the ratio today is unhealthy you

930
00:32:40,190 --> 00:32:42,350
know it's a it's too many so I don't

931
00:32:42,350 --> 00:32:45,740
anticipate a lower ratio maybe a little

932
00:32:45,740 --> 00:32:46,700
bit like when you look at the indeed

933
00:32:46,700 --> 00:32:49,040
companies like envision and and others

934
00:32:49,040 --> 00:32:52,540
that are already kind of employing

935
00:32:53,950 --> 00:32:56,240
already employing this type of pairing

936
00:32:56,240 --> 00:32:58,130
they tend to still be in that sort of 50

937
00:32:58,130 --> 00:33:00,290
to 1 ratio for these one ratio you know

938
00:33:00,290 --> 00:33:03,200
so I don't I don't anticipate fewer

939
00:33:03,200 --> 00:33:04,760
security people would be needed they

940
00:33:04,760 --> 00:33:06,320
noticed maybe we can actually cope with

941
00:33:06,320 --> 00:33:08,300
the load with them on the developer side

942
00:33:08,300 --> 00:33:10,700
it does imply that you know it's just

943
00:33:10,700 --> 00:33:13,070
that ratio alone just demonstrates to

944
00:33:13,070 --> 00:33:15,020
you how you can't just expect developers

945
00:33:15,020 --> 00:33:16,640
to just go off and do what the security

946
00:33:16,640 --> 00:33:18,560
people did as well you know it's a I

947
00:33:18,560 --> 00:33:20,420
guess that the ratio doesn't necessarily

948
00:33:20,420 --> 00:33:21,620
help that because you are outnumbered

949
00:33:21,620 --> 00:33:23,840
before but it still it's it's not

950
00:33:23,840 --> 00:33:25,400
something that's realistic and it's also

951
00:33:25,400 --> 00:33:27,620
gonna take them more effort so you have

952
00:33:27,620 --> 00:33:30,110
to think as you sort of shift some of

953
00:33:30,110 --> 00:33:31,670
that responsibility or the activities

954
00:33:31,670 --> 00:33:35,360
you do have to have that come not just

955
00:33:35,360 --> 00:33:36,830
for the responsibility but also with

956
00:33:36,830 --> 00:33:38,750
tools and also with help to sort of say

957
00:33:38,750 --> 00:33:41,350
how do you actually get that done and

958
00:33:41,350 --> 00:33:44,150
and the other thing I would say is that

959
00:33:44,150 --> 00:33:45,470
some things are actually easier for a

960
00:33:45,470 --> 00:33:46,790
developer to do than a security look the

961
00:33:46,790 --> 00:33:48,350
same security tasks might ease

962
00:33:48,350 --> 00:33:49,669
for developer because the developer

963
00:33:49,669 --> 00:33:52,100
actually understands the application

964
00:33:52,100 --> 00:33:54,460
much better so evaluating for instance

965
00:33:54,460 --> 00:33:56,150
vulnerability once you've acknowledged

966
00:33:56,150 --> 00:33:57,919
it is a vulnerability how does it fit

967
00:33:57,919 --> 00:34:00,289
into the application is all the trivial

968
00:34:00,289 --> 00:34:02,990
for the developer and it's very hard for

969
00:34:02,990 --> 00:34:04,580
a security person who needs to manage

970
00:34:04,580 --> 00:34:06,710
you know interaction with many different

971
00:34:06,710 --> 00:34:08,389
teams and doesn't live and breathe that

972
00:34:08,389 --> 00:34:12,320
know the specific app yeah although you

973
00:34:12,320 --> 00:34:16,760
know security ratios won't change much

974
00:34:16,760 --> 00:34:19,219
but you know their activity will all

975
00:34:19,219 --> 00:34:20,629
right cool

976
00:34:20,629 --> 00:34:21,889
two more questions that just come in

977
00:34:21,889 --> 00:34:25,460
first one from David's caronia guy

978
00:34:25,460 --> 00:34:27,500
touched little on how to think about dev

979
00:34:27,500 --> 00:34:28,639
first security from a product

980
00:34:28,639 --> 00:34:30,918
perspective and I'd like to dive deeper

981
00:34:30,918 --> 00:34:33,020
into that specifically what are the top

982
00:34:33,020 --> 00:34:35,149
three things to consider when building a

983
00:34:35,149 --> 00:34:37,879
dev first security product and what are

984
00:34:37,879 --> 00:34:40,969
the top three pitfalls and mistakes yeah

985
00:34:40,969 --> 00:34:42,980
it's always hard to kind of hold it down

986
00:34:42,980 --> 00:34:44,719
to the top three but first of all I

987
00:34:44,719 --> 00:34:45,830
would say that when you're building an

988
00:34:45,830 --> 00:34:46,909
internal product you're building a

989
00:34:46,909 --> 00:34:48,409
product just the same as when you're

990
00:34:48,409 --> 00:34:49,699
building an external one like I said a

991
00:34:49,699 --> 00:34:51,679
bit more captive audience but hopefully

992
00:34:51,679 --> 00:34:53,060
you're aspiring for the same level of

993
00:34:53,060 --> 00:34:56,418
success you know that so what was it the

994
00:34:56,418 --> 00:35:00,320
top three always again the sin of the

995
00:35:00,320 --> 00:35:01,820
earth so the love of the top three

996
00:35:01,820 --> 00:35:05,720
pitfalls or mistakes and top three

997
00:35:05,720 --> 00:35:07,160
things to consider when building a

998
00:35:07,160 --> 00:35:08,450
deputy well you've got a couple more

999
00:35:08,450 --> 00:35:09,560
questions so that's just going to top

1000
00:35:09,560 --> 00:35:15,260
one def so the top pitfall is the thing

1001
00:35:15,260 --> 00:35:17,090
that you can take an auditor product and

1002
00:35:17,090 --> 00:35:19,130
you can just integrate it into the

1003
00:35:19,130 --> 00:35:20,450
workflow of the developer and that would

1004
00:35:20,450 --> 00:35:22,070
make it a developer product so that's

1005
00:35:22,070 --> 00:35:23,540
probably the primary pitfall there's a

1006
00:35:23,540 --> 00:35:25,520
lot of options from it but actually put

1007
00:35:25,520 --> 00:35:27,020
yourself in their developers shoes and

1008
00:35:27,020 --> 00:35:29,270
think what is it that the developer

1009
00:35:29,270 --> 00:35:31,730
would would need to be successful in the

1010
00:35:31,730 --> 00:35:33,530
day today and actually you know go talk

1011
00:35:33,530 --> 00:35:35,720
to the developer you know you know the

1012
00:35:35,720 --> 00:35:37,310
audacity here you know instead of I'll

1013
00:35:37,310 --> 00:35:39,830
get that input and then I guess comment

1014
00:35:39,830 --> 00:35:45,020
related is the the top the top thing to

1015
00:35:45,020 --> 00:35:46,850
consider is ease-of-use probably kind of

1016
00:35:46,850 --> 00:35:48,230
coming back to the fact that developers

1017
00:35:48,230 --> 00:35:50,210
are expected to do a lot you know so

1018
00:35:50,210 --> 00:35:51,590
really fundamentally you want to raise

1019
00:35:51,590 --> 00:35:53,090
it you want to get them to care the

1020
00:35:53,090 --> 00:35:54,590
product has to be so do you know elegant

1021
00:35:54,590 --> 00:35:56,480
and you know very secure but if it's not

1022
00:35:56,480 --> 00:35:58,520
easy it's not gonna be used so it has to

1023
00:35:58,520 --> 00:36:01,040
be very straightforward for a developer

1024
00:36:01,040 --> 00:36:02,300
use case

1025
00:36:02,300 --> 00:36:04,970
No we have a few more questions near so

1026
00:36:04,970 --> 00:36:06,170
I'll encourage you to jump into the

1027
00:36:06,170 --> 00:36:08,450
Bella Latro and answer some of these

1028
00:36:08,450 --> 00:36:09,890
what I want to finish off this is a

1029
00:36:09,890 --> 00:36:11,900
really interesting one

1030
00:36:11,900 --> 00:36:14,930
Brad says thanks to great session what's

1031
00:36:14,930 --> 00:36:18,680
the metrics for efficiency you suggest

1032
00:36:18,680 --> 00:36:21,109
as a as best to measure dev empowerment

1033
00:36:21,109 --> 00:36:24,140
yeah it's it's really really like

1034
00:36:24,140 --> 00:36:25,760
metrics and security metrics is always

1035
00:36:25,760 --> 00:36:27,410
hard matters an earring and hard metric

1036
00:36:27,410 --> 00:36:28,970
and security measuring risk you know

1037
00:36:28,970 --> 00:36:31,910
it's super super hard I'll give a few

1038
00:36:31,910 --> 00:36:33,140
guidance oh I don't have like a magic

1039
00:36:33,140 --> 00:36:35,119
number to give but I'd say when you look

1040
00:36:35,119 --> 00:36:36,200
at security

1041
00:36:36,200 --> 00:36:39,020
you should look breaches they're not a

1042
00:36:39,020 --> 00:36:40,460
good feedback loop but you should

1043
00:36:40,460 --> 00:36:44,780
separate your backlog from your addition

1044
00:36:44,780 --> 00:36:46,880
of vulnerabilities from response so

1045
00:36:46,880 --> 00:36:48,650
those are the three bits I'll start from

1046
00:36:48,650 --> 00:36:50,510
the last responses like and you can set

1047
00:36:50,510 --> 00:36:53,240
SLA so how quickly do you respond when

1048
00:36:53,240 --> 00:36:54,890
an issue comes and reported to you

1049
00:36:54,890 --> 00:36:56,990
that's a process question it can be

1050
00:36:56,990 --> 00:36:59,660
optimized and it includes how quickly

1051
00:36:59,660 --> 00:37:01,160
can you make a decision do you have the

1052
00:37:01,160 --> 00:37:02,840
right information at the time even when

1053
00:37:02,840 --> 00:37:04,910
you chose not to address it that's still

1054
00:37:04,910 --> 00:37:07,250
like an SLA element so that's one the

1055
00:37:07,250 --> 00:37:08,720
second is this notion of not getting

1056
00:37:08,720 --> 00:37:11,060
worse can you stop the bleeding right so

1057
00:37:11,060 --> 00:37:14,000
try to measure how many issues since you

1058
00:37:14,000 --> 00:37:15,800
started as though you had no issues at

1059
00:37:15,800 --> 00:37:17,840
the moment how many new issues get

1060
00:37:17,840 --> 00:37:19,540
introduced that you find out about after

1061
00:37:19,540 --> 00:37:21,859
and maybe even how quickly did you find

1062
00:37:21,859 --> 00:37:23,119
so try to sort of figure out four new

1063
00:37:23,119 --> 00:37:24,950
issues forget the backlog four new

1064
00:37:24,950 --> 00:37:26,060
issues how are you doing that's probably

1065
00:37:26,060 --> 00:37:27,830
the fastest that's the measure you want

1066
00:37:27,830 --> 00:37:30,140
to do to focus on first right like

1067
00:37:30,140 --> 00:37:31,400
that's not the leaky bucket right

1068
00:37:31,400 --> 00:37:32,750
otherwise like you keep trying to

1069
00:37:32,750 --> 00:37:34,220
address the backlog but you're creating

1070
00:37:34,220 --> 00:37:36,109
more and more faster and then last is

1071
00:37:36,109 --> 00:37:37,850
really around that backlog we're really

1072
00:37:37,850 --> 00:37:39,880
it's about the strategy for addressing

1073
00:37:39,880 --> 00:37:42,680
you know the the rate of the issues in

1074
00:37:42,680 --> 00:37:44,900
the technology it's more but a constant

1075
00:37:44,900 --> 00:37:47,510
kind of model of constantly improving

1076
00:37:47,510 --> 00:37:48,650
constantly fixing things

1077
00:37:48,650 --> 00:37:50,810
all of those are overlaid of course on a

1078
00:37:50,810 --> 00:37:52,190
risk poster like you always have to

1079
00:37:52,190 --> 00:37:54,080
think about when you do address an issue

1080
00:37:54,080 --> 00:37:55,790
are you addressing the most important

1081
00:37:55,790 --> 00:37:58,550
issues so that's hopefully that kind of

1082
00:37:58,550 --> 00:38:00,380
gives you a place to start measuring is

1083
00:38:00,380 --> 00:38:02,140
hard you know especially insecure

1084
00:38:02,140 --> 00:38:04,280
wonderful guy thank you very very much

1085
00:38:04,280 --> 00:38:06,680
for your for the session and like I said

1086
00:38:06,680 --> 00:38:08,359
if you're able to spend some time

1087
00:38:08,359 --> 00:38:09,890
umbrella there's a there's a bunch on

1088
00:38:09,890 --> 00:38:11,960
the main stage more quite a little bit

1089
00:38:11,960 --> 00:38:14,570
so thank you very much and enjoy the

1090
00:38:14,570 --> 00:38:17,109
rest of the conference
