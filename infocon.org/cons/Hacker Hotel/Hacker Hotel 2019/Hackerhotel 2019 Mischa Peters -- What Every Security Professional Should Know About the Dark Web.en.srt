isolate our motivate over the dark web

21
00:01:07,840 --> 00:01:16,090
yeah macaque English alright I can do it

22
00:01:13,660 --> 00:01:18,429
in English I prefer it easier I don't

23
00:01:16,090 --> 00:01:23,370
have to translate it much better alright

24
00:01:18,430 --> 00:01:23,370
do I need to do the introduction good

25
00:01:26,840 --> 00:01:41,820
fine all right so - laughs all right -

26
00:01:38,130 --> 00:01:43,440
leaving anyway um so I'm gonna talk

27
00:01:41,820 --> 00:01:47,100
about the dark web and what you should

28
00:01:43,440 --> 00:01:48,600
know about the dark web because you

29
00:01:47,100 --> 00:01:50,910
cannot defend your business your

30
00:01:48,600 --> 00:01:53,070
organization whatever if you don't know

31
00:01:50,910 --> 00:01:57,000
what threats are coming your way that's

32
00:01:53,070 --> 00:02:01,169
the premise of this of this talk and

33
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:03,120
before we start do people know what the

34
00:02:01,170 --> 00:02:05,060
difference is between the clear and the

35
00:02:03,120 --> 00:02:08,759
dark web

36
00:02:05,060 --> 00:02:14,160
everybody knows don't have to explain do

37
00:02:08,759 --> 00:02:17,459
it anyway so what the market has defined

38
00:02:14,160 --> 00:02:20,400
as clear web is pretty much everything

39
00:02:17,460 --> 00:02:23,550
that you can get through by doing a

40
00:02:20,400 --> 00:02:27,420
search on start page or DuckDuckGo not

41
00:02:23,550 --> 00:02:29,970
gonna mention Google where you can

42
00:02:27,420 --> 00:02:31,920
actually look at a source without any

43
00:02:29,970 --> 00:02:35,070
credentials without any special

44
00:02:31,920 --> 00:02:38,640
protocols and so on so that's clear or

45
00:02:35,070 --> 00:02:40,769
surface web then you have a huge portion

46
00:02:38,640 --> 00:02:42,750
that is deep everything that has

47
00:02:40,770 --> 00:02:46,050
credentials is already let's say

48
00:02:42,750 --> 00:02:48,120
considered deep and then there's a part

49
00:02:46,050 --> 00:02:50,850
that's most interesting for us at least

50
00:02:48,120 --> 00:02:52,680
as a company which is the dark web where

51
00:02:50,850 --> 00:02:54,930
you either need a special protocol and

52
00:02:52,680 --> 00:02:57,360
our credentials and or invitations and

53
00:02:54,930 --> 00:03:00,780
or whatever so that's what I'm going to

54
00:02:57,360 --> 00:03:03,300
talk about what's the dark web

55
00:03:00,780 --> 00:03:05,730
reputation if you look at the media it's

56
00:03:03,300 --> 00:03:09,540
bad and it needs to go away people are

57
00:03:05,730 --> 00:03:13,950
not happy about it it's it's increasing

58
00:03:09,540 --> 00:03:17,790
all the bad stuff is bad even if you

59
00:03:13,950 --> 00:03:20,549
look at some tour statistics websites

60
00:03:17,790 --> 00:03:22,769
come and go or dark web sites web sites

61
00:03:20,550 --> 00:03:26,760
come and go and the whole idea behind it

62
00:03:22,770 --> 00:03:30,150
is it's criminal criminal activity in

63
00:03:26,760 --> 00:03:31,679
general that's what people think I've

64
00:03:30,150 --> 00:03:32,940
done this talk a couple of times and

65
00:03:31,680 --> 00:03:37,090
every time it's always the same

66
00:03:32,940 --> 00:03:42,579
perception that people have but

67
00:03:37,090 --> 00:03:45,459
at stake sensu the cyber war Twitter

68
00:03:42,580 --> 00:03:47,860
feed people follow that no oh it's

69
00:03:45,459 --> 00:03:50,680
actually pretty funny because they they

70
00:03:47,860 --> 00:03:53,440
take the art of war and put it a cyber

71
00:03:50,680 --> 00:03:56,950
sauce on it so your adversary does not

72
00:03:53,440 --> 00:03:59,079
wait for you to finish patching one

73
00:03:56,950 --> 00:04:00,910
another one the end the enemy does not

74
00:03:59,080 --> 00:04:02,920
check your risk register prior to

75
00:04:00,910 --> 00:04:05,200
attacking and the one that I like the

76
00:04:02,920 --> 00:04:08,350
most is this one management will not

77
00:04:05,200 --> 00:04:09,850
provide additional funding or additional

78
00:04:08,350 --> 00:04:13,420
budget based on ancient quotes on a

79
00:04:09,850 --> 00:04:14,890
PowerPoint presentation so the reason

80
00:04:13,420 --> 00:04:16,839
why I'm saying this is that there's

81
00:04:14,890 --> 00:04:19,320
actually a lot at stake when you talk

82
00:04:16,839 --> 00:04:21,219
about cyber threat intelligence or

83
00:04:19,320 --> 00:04:24,520
specifically dark web or threat

84
00:04:21,220 --> 00:04:27,220
intelligence in general software

85
00:04:24,520 --> 00:04:31,539
exploits are being sold and being talked

86
00:04:27,220 --> 00:04:35,860
about data leakage we've probably seen a

87
00:04:31,540 --> 00:04:37,840
lot in the in the last week's even brand

88
00:04:35,860 --> 00:04:40,540
impersonation customer phishing cyber

89
00:04:37,840 --> 00:04:42,219
fraud supply chain attacks and I'm going

90
00:04:40,540 --> 00:04:46,360
to put some some examples in there as

91
00:04:42,220 --> 00:04:51,000
well but what do we know about the dark

92
00:04:46,360 --> 00:04:51,000
web what can you get on the dark web

93
00:04:51,510 --> 00:05:03,700
give me some examples yes yes thank you

94
00:04:58,590 --> 00:05:05,200
sorry yeah as well so so now the

95
00:05:03,700 --> 00:05:06,570
interesting part is I've done this talk

96
00:05:05,200 --> 00:05:09,969
now a couple of times and it's always

97
00:05:06,570 --> 00:05:12,820
drugs weapons or weapon usually it's

98
00:05:09,970 --> 00:05:14,710
weapons drugs and of course also other

99
00:05:12,820 --> 00:05:18,430
things submarines and tanks and all

100
00:05:14,710 --> 00:05:21,270
these things so what's the primary

101
00:05:18,430 --> 00:05:23,710
reason why people are using the dark web

102
00:05:21,270 --> 00:05:27,609
from an attacker perspective it's

103
00:05:23,710 --> 00:05:30,669
anonymity it's not only for attackers

104
00:05:27,610 --> 00:05:33,490
there's other reasons wine anonymity is

105
00:05:30,669 --> 00:05:36,010
a good idea and to give you an idea how

106
00:05:33,490 --> 00:05:37,870
that works I don't think I have to

107
00:05:36,010 --> 00:05:39,669
explain to a lot of people here how tor

108
00:05:37,870 --> 00:05:42,520
works but here it is in a couple of

109
00:05:39,669 --> 00:05:44,979
slides or a couple of animations

110
00:05:42,520 --> 00:05:47,859
basically your traffic is bounced

111
00:05:44,979 --> 00:05:50,159
between different entities that that

112
00:05:47,860 --> 00:05:57,910
anonymize your traffic

113
00:05:50,160 --> 00:06:03,930
so who runs a relay whoa who runs an

114
00:05:57,910 --> 00:06:07,840
exit note usually it's usually zero

115
00:06:03,930 --> 00:06:09,460
because people are scared so in order

116
00:06:07,840 --> 00:06:13,150
for us this to operate is that people

117
00:06:09,460 --> 00:06:14,739
like brenno and psy need to run a relay

118
00:06:13,150 --> 00:06:16,479
note that actually bounces your traffic

119
00:06:14,740 --> 00:06:19,300
around so that you don't really know

120
00:06:16,479 --> 00:06:20,710
where the traffic is coming from and

121
00:06:19,300 --> 00:06:21,820
then it really doesn't breathe it

122
00:06:20,710 --> 00:06:23,859
doesn't really matter where you're then

123
00:06:21,820 --> 00:06:25,810
actually going because the whole idea is

124
00:06:23,860 --> 00:06:29,530
that you can pretty much pretend who you

125
00:06:25,810 --> 00:06:32,020
want to be some general or who's that

126
00:06:29,530 --> 00:06:33,758
Darth Vader or it doesn't really matter

127
00:06:32,020 --> 00:06:37,659
the whole idea is that you can pretty

128
00:06:33,759 --> 00:06:40,270
much interact anonymously with buyers

129
00:06:37,660 --> 00:06:43,180
with sellers with data whatever it's

130
00:06:40,270 --> 00:06:44,979
going on so the most what people think

131
00:06:43,180 --> 00:06:47,620
is that it's a criminal activity hub

132
00:06:44,979 --> 00:06:50,020
right so that you can rent a hacker or

133
00:06:47,620 --> 00:06:52,270
you can look for an insider or you can

134
00:06:50,020 --> 00:06:54,370
look for some information and that's the

135
00:06:52,270 --> 00:06:57,549
general idea or the general perception

136
00:06:54,370 --> 00:07:01,060
that that I see that people have even on

137
00:06:57,550 --> 00:07:05,020
a on a CIO or seizo level I've done this

138
00:07:01,060 --> 00:07:07,389
talk once a long time ago for a bunch of

139
00:07:05,020 --> 00:07:09,430
CIOs and ask the same question and there

140
00:07:07,389 --> 00:07:11,620
I started who knows the dark web and

141
00:07:09,430 --> 00:07:12,909
then a couple of hands went up and how

142
00:07:11,620 --> 00:07:15,340
many people have been on the dog with

143
00:07:12,909 --> 00:07:19,270
one hand winner and do you know what's

144
00:07:15,340 --> 00:07:20,919
there zero so there's a lot of people

145
00:07:19,270 --> 00:07:24,340
that just don't know in the wrong

146
00:07:20,919 --> 00:07:25,990
position what's really going on there so

147
00:07:24,340 --> 00:07:28,560
the other thing what is a good thing

148
00:07:25,990 --> 00:07:33,389
from a nanny

149
00:07:28,560 --> 00:07:36,520
hacktivists are they're so because it's

150
00:07:33,389 --> 00:07:38,860
anonymized you can communicate in a way

151
00:07:36,520 --> 00:07:40,990
that's usually if you're on the right

152
00:07:38,860 --> 00:07:44,710
source not really traceable so there are

153
00:07:40,990 --> 00:07:46,570
some some good things with dark web and

154
00:07:44,710 --> 00:07:49,030
tor in general and the same for

155
00:07:46,570 --> 00:07:51,729
journalists and sources and protecting

156
00:07:49,030 --> 00:07:54,039
sources and if you're in a country where

157
00:07:51,729 --> 00:07:55,870
the regime is not so much in your favor

158
00:07:54,039 --> 00:07:57,460
you can use this actually get your

159
00:07:55,870 --> 00:08:00,100
message out so there are some some good

160
00:07:57,460 --> 00:08:04,180
things around the dark web as well

161
00:08:00,100 --> 00:08:06,400
but besides the weapons and drugs and

162
00:08:04,180 --> 00:08:08,710
the tanks what else is there that is

163
00:08:06,400 --> 00:08:10,630
useful for you to know in order to

164
00:08:08,710 --> 00:08:13,150
protect your infrastructure your

165
00:08:10,630 --> 00:08:15,969
environment your customer your your your

166
00:08:13,150 --> 00:08:20,169
company from what has been talked about

167
00:08:15,970 --> 00:08:22,330
or being sold on the dark web one that

168
00:08:20,170 --> 00:08:22,720
probably people can think of okay yeah

169
00:08:22,330 --> 00:08:25,719
sure

170
00:08:22,720 --> 00:08:30,520
credit cards is one thing that we find a

171
00:08:25,720 --> 00:08:34,300
lot for our customers being sold being

172
00:08:30,520 --> 00:08:36,460
published not only credit cards from

173
00:08:34,299 --> 00:08:38,439
financial institutions or banks or

174
00:08:36,460 --> 00:08:41,560
corporate credit cards but what we also

175
00:08:38,440 --> 00:08:44,080
see is private credit cards from people

176
00:08:41,559 --> 00:08:47,290
that are being shared okay I found this

177
00:08:44,080 --> 00:08:49,480
credit card he's the CDC expiration have

178
00:08:47,290 --> 00:08:53,189
fun and people just share that on

179
00:08:49,480 --> 00:08:55,450
regular forums so that's happening

180
00:08:53,190 --> 00:08:58,210
another thing that you can probably also

181
00:08:55,450 --> 00:09:00,160
think of is DDoS services you can also

182
00:08:58,210 --> 00:09:02,380
find it on on the clear web even though

183
00:09:00,160 --> 00:09:04,480
there's been a crackdown lately where a

184
00:09:02,380 --> 00:09:07,570
lot of web stressors have been taken

185
00:09:04,480 --> 00:09:09,400
offline but that's one service that is

186
00:09:07,570 --> 00:09:12,190
is being provided and it's not very

187
00:09:09,400 --> 00:09:14,020
expensive and then your your website's

188
00:09:12,190 --> 00:09:17,140
just become service unavailable for

189
00:09:14,020 --> 00:09:19,650
example another thing accounts are being

190
00:09:17,140 --> 00:09:22,650
sold either from from banks or

191
00:09:19,650 --> 00:09:26,680
credentials from large organizations and

192
00:09:22,650 --> 00:09:30,069
you can if you can think it it's

193
00:09:26,680 --> 00:09:34,839
probably being traded or sold on on the

194
00:09:30,070 --> 00:09:37,600
dark web also complete bank accounts

195
00:09:34,840 --> 00:09:40,960
with money already there that have been

196
00:09:37,600 --> 00:09:43,480
cleaned or whatever that is needed that

197
00:09:40,960 --> 00:09:46,120
you're that you're then looking for of

198
00:09:43,480 --> 00:09:51,390
course also documents that are being

199
00:09:46,120 --> 00:09:54,520
sold shared so other types of data leaks

200
00:09:51,390 --> 00:09:57,990
email conversations core documents

201
00:09:54,520 --> 00:09:59,920
there's a lot of stuff that's there

202
00:09:57,990 --> 00:10:03,160
another thing that I found very

203
00:09:59,920 --> 00:10:06,849
interesting is also hacking tutorials so

204
00:10:03,160 --> 00:10:08,439
that in this case it's for free services

205
00:10:06,850 --> 00:10:10,420
on the flight but we should also see a

206
00:10:08,440 --> 00:10:13,660
lot of hacking tutorials against telecom

207
00:10:10,420 --> 00:10:16,029
operators to circumvent sir and prepaid

208
00:10:13,660 --> 00:10:18,579
mechanism or prepaid security mechanisms

209
00:10:16,029 --> 00:10:21,220
or how to dowse till dial out or or call

210
00:10:18,579 --> 00:10:24,758
for free or use data for free a lot of

211
00:10:21,220 --> 00:10:27,880
these type of services are there the one

212
00:10:24,759 --> 00:10:30,040
that is probably one of the most that is

213
00:10:27,880 --> 00:10:32,790
happening against not only our customers

214
00:10:30,040 --> 00:10:34,870
but customers of our customers is

215
00:10:32,790 --> 00:10:36,759
phishing it's still a rampant problem

216
00:10:34,870 --> 00:10:38,740
and in order to do proper fishing you

217
00:10:36,759 --> 00:10:40,569
need a website that looks similar to

218
00:10:38,740 --> 00:10:43,120
what you're actually trying to do so

219
00:10:40,569 --> 00:10:45,240
scam sites or or phishing kits are

220
00:10:43,120 --> 00:10:48,490
readily available you can just deploy

221
00:10:45,240 --> 00:10:51,069
register a domain referencing to YouTube

222
00:10:48,490 --> 00:10:54,310
Reno's talk but from a different angle I

223
00:10:51,069 --> 00:10:56,769
guess so if you want to attack instead

224
00:10:54,310 --> 00:10:59,319
of consume data and collect data you can

225
00:10:56,769 --> 00:11:01,690
also do that and what we're seeing here

226
00:10:59,319 --> 00:11:04,810
is that not specifically our our

227
00:11:01,690 --> 00:11:07,029
customers are being attacked but it's

228
00:11:04,810 --> 00:11:20,529
usually one of their partners one of

229
00:11:07,029 --> 00:11:23,079
their vendors yes oh okay so we see a

230
00:11:20,529 --> 00:11:25,899
lot that our customers of our customers

231
00:11:23,079 --> 00:11:29,949
are being targeted so either invoice

232
00:11:25,899 --> 00:11:33,970
fraud or CEO frauds where goods are our

233
00:11:29,949 --> 00:11:36,189
orders delivered never paid or goods are

234
00:11:33,970 --> 00:11:38,050
ordered and then someone else hijacks

235
00:11:36,189 --> 00:11:41,170
that stream say well payment needs to go

236
00:11:38,050 --> 00:11:44,019
there these things happen on a regular

237
00:11:41,170 --> 00:11:47,290
regular basis

238
00:11:44,019 --> 00:11:50,620
also hiring insiders happens a lot

239
00:11:47,290 --> 00:11:52,810
that's also how Ashley Madison got

240
00:11:50,620 --> 00:11:55,089
targeted so people were just looking for

241
00:11:52,810 --> 00:11:57,160
an insider somewhere that was behind the

242
00:11:55,089 --> 00:11:58,930
right buttons and behind with the right

243
00:11:57,160 --> 00:12:02,949
credentials in the right authority

244
00:11:58,930 --> 00:12:07,300
within an organization so that you see

245
00:12:02,949 --> 00:12:10,420
that on a very regular basis actually

246
00:12:07,300 --> 00:12:13,479
Madison here hacker services are

247
00:12:10,420 --> 00:12:16,410
requested and offered so there's a lot

248
00:12:13,480 --> 00:12:19,959
of different marketplaces that are there

249
00:12:16,410 --> 00:12:21,939
so one thing that in order for us as an

250
00:12:19,959 --> 00:12:25,300
organization actually to get to all this

251
00:12:21,939 --> 00:12:27,430
data there's a lot of research that we

252
00:12:25,300 --> 00:12:29,349
need to do in order to find

253
00:12:27,430 --> 00:12:31,900
that specific source the nice thing is

254
00:12:29,350 --> 00:12:34,570
is that if you're starting a new

255
00:12:31,900 --> 00:12:36,040
marketplace or a new forum you still

256
00:12:34,570 --> 00:12:37,720
need to get the people that are

257
00:12:36,040 --> 00:12:40,150
interested in whatever you're trading or

258
00:12:37,720 --> 00:12:42,190
your after you're selling so there

259
00:12:40,150 --> 00:12:43,750
there's some let's say marketing that

260
00:12:42,190 --> 00:12:48,040
needs to be done in order for the people

261
00:12:43,750 --> 00:12:50,020
that you want to sell data or goods

262
00:12:48,040 --> 00:12:52,810
through your platform you have to get

263
00:12:50,020 --> 00:12:55,600
them to your to your platform so that's

264
00:12:52,810 --> 00:12:58,000
also how we go after these sources now

265
00:12:55,600 --> 00:12:59,950
the tricky part with gaining access to

266
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:02,020
these sources sometimes you can just

267
00:12:59,950 --> 00:13:03,400
register like on a regular form or

268
00:13:02,020 --> 00:13:06,819
regular market place like eBay for

269
00:13:03,400 --> 00:13:08,470
example so then that works quite well

270
00:13:06,820 --> 00:13:11,620
but in a lot of cases you need to be

271
00:13:08,470 --> 00:13:13,600
introduced or you need to be vouched for

272
00:13:11,620 --> 00:13:16,600
that you're not law enforcement or an

273
00:13:13,600 --> 00:13:18,490
organization like ours and that have a

274
00:13:16,600 --> 00:13:21,490
different intent with the data that

275
00:13:18,490 --> 00:13:23,230
we're collecting so it's it's it like a

276
00:13:21,490 --> 00:13:25,600
cat-and-mouse game

277
00:13:23,230 --> 00:13:30,570
the other problem is that sources gum

278
00:13:25,600 --> 00:13:33,130
and sources go whoa-ho so that also

279
00:13:30,570 --> 00:13:37,900
happens and the other week what we've

280
00:13:33,130 --> 00:13:40,090
done is based on some human intelligence

281
00:13:37,900 --> 00:13:42,370
that we're also applying is that we're

282
00:13:40,090 --> 00:13:45,010
acquiring certain assets so we

283
00:13:42,370 --> 00:13:47,320
identified a threat actor on a different

284
00:13:45,010 --> 00:13:49,660
market or a specific market place that

285
00:13:47,320 --> 00:13:53,170
was claiming that he had credentials

286
00:13:49,660 --> 00:13:56,530
that were not published about yet so we

287
00:13:53,170 --> 00:13:59,560
started the whole process to actually

288
00:13:56,530 --> 00:14:01,360
get him to trust us in order to share

289
00:13:59,560 --> 00:14:04,689
that data with us there was an article

290
00:14:01,360 --> 00:14:06,850
on TechCrunch about it where he had

291
00:14:04,690 --> 00:14:10,540
hundred and twenty five million accounts

292
00:14:06,850 --> 00:14:12,550
that were not seen before and we managed

293
00:14:10,540 --> 00:14:14,860
for some reason I unfortunately don't

294
00:14:12,550 --> 00:14:18,099
know the details we managed to get that

295
00:14:14,860 --> 00:14:20,200
that from him and we we had validated

296
00:14:18,100 --> 00:14:22,510
that it came from this source so it

297
00:14:20,200 --> 00:14:23,860
wasn't well I have these credentials I

298
00:14:22,510 --> 00:14:25,540
put some other credentials in and then I

299
00:14:23,860 --> 00:14:27,370
rerelease it which is what happening a

300
00:14:25,540 --> 00:14:29,949
lot collection number one collection

301
00:14:27,370 --> 00:14:31,360
number two through five it's just a lot

302
00:14:29,950 --> 00:14:33,700
of database dumbs that are being

303
00:14:31,360 --> 00:14:35,770
re-released all over again but in this

304
00:14:33,700 --> 00:14:37,750
case we were actually able to pinpoint a

305
00:14:35,770 --> 00:14:40,630
threat actor that has done the deed and

306
00:14:37,750 --> 00:14:40,899
had the goods that we were able to to

307
00:14:40,630 --> 00:14:43,089
get

308
00:14:40,899 --> 00:14:44,920
from him and based on that we can then

309
00:14:43,089 --> 00:14:46,990
look for information that is there from

310
00:14:44,920 --> 00:14:51,180
our customers in order to notify them

311
00:14:46,990 --> 00:14:56,199
say your credentials are now somewhere

312
00:14:51,180 --> 00:15:00,128
so and I'm always going way too fast

313
00:14:56,199 --> 00:15:02,589
I notice because the whole idea is of

314
00:15:00,129 --> 00:15:04,959
course that with all that data that is

315
00:15:02,589 --> 00:15:08,410
on the dark web that you can then

316
00:15:04,959 --> 00:15:10,868
protect your organization now I

317
00:15:08,410 --> 00:15:14,439
mentioned that we need to do a lot of

318
00:15:10,869 --> 00:15:16,869
research but what you can also do is

319
00:15:14,439 --> 00:15:19,809
just start typing away in some search

320
00:15:16,869 --> 00:15:22,209
engines and hit on dark websites and

321
00:15:19,809 --> 00:15:25,420
then you get a nice list and you get

322
00:15:22,209 --> 00:15:27,429
redirected to a page that even has a

323
00:15:25,420 --> 00:15:29,529
nice indexed page of the different

324
00:15:27,429 --> 00:15:31,569
marketplaces and their status even if

325
00:15:29,529 --> 00:15:34,059
they're if they're offline or often or

326
00:15:31,569 --> 00:15:36,790
online so there's already a lot of

327
00:15:34,059 --> 00:15:39,399
information that you can gather in order

328
00:15:36,790 --> 00:15:43,748
to find what is there because the whole

329
00:15:39,399 --> 00:15:45,309
idea behind what I'm trying to realize

330
00:15:43,749 --> 00:15:47,439
that there's a lot of information that

331
00:15:45,309 --> 00:15:49,569
can be useful to protect your

332
00:15:47,439 --> 00:15:53,290
organization and to fortify your

333
00:15:49,569 --> 00:15:55,689
infrastructure even even more and of

334
00:15:53,290 --> 00:15:57,998
course you can start typing other things

335
00:15:55,689 --> 00:16:00,248
in there like dark web credit cards and

336
00:15:57,999 --> 00:16:01,929
then you get another list of websites

337
00:16:00,249 --> 00:16:04,779
going well and you can go there here's

338
00:16:01,929 --> 00:16:06,160
the onion address this de-rating so

339
00:16:04,779 --> 00:16:07,749
there's a lot of information that you

340
00:16:06,160 --> 00:16:20,740
can just get without actually going

341
00:16:07,749 --> 00:16:23,009
there so any questions yes oh I can

342
00:16:20,740 --> 00:16:23,009
throw

343
00:16:26,179 --> 00:16:35,459
you only talked about the onion web now

344
00:16:31,919 --> 00:16:43,129
yes I saw also so you had a little

345
00:16:35,459 --> 00:16:43,128
rabbit of again Freenet I mean yes

346
00:16:43,649 --> 00:16:52,439
I heard that Freenet was more secure in

347
00:16:48,259 --> 00:16:54,779
that it's harder to hack for from a

348
00:16:52,439 --> 00:16:57,779
foreign government to get get the data

349
00:16:54,779 --> 00:17:02,999
about users what's your idea about that

350
00:16:57,779 --> 00:17:04,679
so for us that's as inside us as an

351
00:17:02,999 --> 00:17:07,350
organization and and the data that we

352
00:17:04,679 --> 00:17:09,299
deliver it doesn't really matter

353
00:17:07,349 --> 00:17:13,260
we're not interested in taking down a

354
00:17:09,299 --> 00:17:15,539
source we're not interested really who's

355
00:17:13,260 --> 00:17:17,699
behind it or how much money they make

356
00:17:15,539 --> 00:17:19,919
we're more interested in the actual data

357
00:17:17,699 --> 00:17:21,870
that is being sold and being offered

358
00:17:19,919 --> 00:17:25,649
then we can tell our customers say hey

359
00:17:21,869 --> 00:17:27,448
someone is now has your your account

360
00:17:25,648 --> 00:17:30,510
data or your customer information and

361
00:17:27,449 --> 00:17:31,110
they're selling that are you aware no we

362
00:17:30,510 --> 00:17:33,779
did not

363
00:17:31,110 --> 00:17:36,330
so that's more our interest so we're not

364
00:17:33,779 --> 00:17:38,370
so much interested in in the people

365
00:17:36,330 --> 00:17:42,449
behind it and their intent it's more the

366
00:17:38,370 --> 00:17:45,000
fact that it's there so the approach for

367
00:17:42,450 --> 00:17:49,710
us it's a little bit easier to then go

368
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:51,750
get access be a good neighbor in that

369
00:17:49,710 --> 00:17:54,059
marketplace in order to find out who's

370
00:17:51,750 --> 00:17:57,690
there and what data is there so that's

371
00:17:54,059 --> 00:17:59,879
the slightly different approach I just

372
00:17:57,690 --> 00:18:01,980
got a question from from a colleague of

373
00:17:59,880 --> 00:18:04,380
mine saying hey because we're also on

374
00:18:01,980 --> 00:18:05,700
things like telegram and whatsapp and

375
00:18:04,380 --> 00:18:07,620
and he goes yeah but that whole

376
00:18:05,700 --> 00:18:10,139
communication is encrypted yeah but if

377
00:18:07,620 --> 00:18:12,418
you're in the group then it doesn't

378
00:18:10,139 --> 00:18:14,340
really matter so it's all for us to gain

379
00:18:12,419 --> 00:18:16,889
access the idea to gain access to a

380
00:18:14,340 --> 00:18:21,379
specific source and then collect that

381
00:18:16,889 --> 00:18:21,379
data as much as possible

382
00:18:26,909 --> 00:18:38,799
where to no questions nice number we

383
00:18:33,960 --> 00:18:42,580
sorry sorry

384
00:18:38,799 --> 00:18:45,549
still working yes yes do you also check

385
00:18:42,580 --> 00:18:48,279
how serious the offers on that part of

386
00:18:45,549 --> 00:18:53,679
the dark web is I can imagine that

387
00:18:48,279 --> 00:18:55,989
Renton inside there is a good way to to

388
00:18:53,679 --> 00:19:00,789
have negative consequences for your

389
00:18:55,989 --> 00:19:03,159
colleagues in what way if I said his

390
00:19:00,789 --> 00:19:06,279
colleague of mine and I would put his

391
00:19:03,159 --> 00:19:10,389
information oh okay that's easy inside

392
00:19:06,279 --> 00:19:13,179
you can rent sure is that a fellow

393
00:19:10,389 --> 00:19:18,399
option or is that outside your scope out

394
00:19:13,179 --> 00:19:19,629
yeah yes thank you no so but it depends

395
00:19:18,399 --> 00:19:21,459
on a little bit how that goes right

396
00:19:19,629 --> 00:19:24,699
because someone's can say hey I'm an

397
00:19:21,460 --> 00:19:26,259
insider I have data to sell and then you

398
00:19:24,700 --> 00:19:29,169
would probably not say hey I'm so-and-so

399
00:19:26,259 --> 00:19:31,570
you can reach me on this number that

400
00:19:29,169 --> 00:19:33,999
usually takes a little bit before you go

401
00:19:31,570 --> 00:19:37,299
okay can we trust each other yes and the

402
00:19:33,999 --> 00:19:39,999
same as if someone is requesting an

403
00:19:37,299 --> 00:19:42,039
insider but that's indeed beyond our

404
00:19:39,999 --> 00:19:44,499
scope what we then do is we say hey

405
00:19:42,039 --> 00:19:49,029
someone is looking or offering now you

406
00:19:44,499 --> 00:19:53,799
figure it out we can sometimes help we

407
00:19:49,029 --> 00:19:55,419
can engage also so we can do the let's

408
00:19:53,799 --> 00:19:58,149
say an extension from from a human

409
00:19:55,419 --> 00:20:00,460
perspective so we can engage with the DD

410
00:19:58,149 --> 00:20:02,379
insider or the threat actor or someone

411
00:20:00,460 --> 00:20:04,450
who's selling data so we can also help

412
00:20:02,379 --> 00:20:06,459
our customers there say oh I have

413
00:20:04,450 --> 00:20:10,149
accounts or have documents or have

414
00:20:06,460 --> 00:20:13,989
credit cards or whatever it is we can

415
00:20:10,149 --> 00:20:17,678
ask for samples we can say okay just you

416
00:20:13,989 --> 00:20:21,070
can buy the data for you so but from

417
00:20:17,679 --> 00:20:24,429
from a identifying how valid the source

418
00:20:21,070 --> 00:20:28,289
or the data or the insider is that's up

419
00:20:24,429 --> 00:20:28,289
to the customer or

420
00:20:33,250 --> 00:20:40,020
it's being offered someone someone can

421
00:20:36,820 --> 00:20:42,490
buy it so the idea behind it is

422
00:20:40,020 --> 00:20:46,720
especially when it's about accounts or

423
00:20:42,490 --> 00:20:48,669
it only makes sense to acquire data when

424
00:20:46,720 --> 00:20:51,460
you can actually destroy it after the

425
00:20:48,669 --> 00:20:54,929
fact or change it so it's no longer

426
00:20:51,460 --> 00:20:58,000
useful for the attacker to say okay

427
00:20:54,929 --> 00:21:00,250
credit card numbers for example we buy a

428
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:03,700
truck ton of credit card numbers for

429
00:21:00,250 --> 00:21:06,820
customers so then okay here's assets no

430
00:21:03,700 --> 00:21:08,320
longer valid so in that respect they're

431
00:21:06,820 --> 00:21:13,270
they're pretty much buying their own

432
00:21:08,320 --> 00:21:15,158
content back back if then some

433
00:21:13,270 --> 00:21:17,580
government agency is listening in and

434
00:21:15,159 --> 00:21:25,030
we're the buyer and they're okay sure

435
00:21:17,580 --> 00:21:27,210
you can visit us in Israel not in the

436
00:21:25,030 --> 00:21:27,210
Hague

437
00:21:28,620 --> 00:21:40,679
any other questions usually there's a

438
00:21:31,929 --> 00:21:47,579
lot more thank you very much

439
00:21:40,680 --> 00:21:47,579
[Applause]
