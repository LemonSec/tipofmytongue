1
00:00:05,420 --> 00:00:08,660
Hi, we are from Toool and related.

2
00:00:08,960 --> 00:00:11,760
Yes you are, for today. Deputized.

3
00:00:14,135 --> 00:00:17,495
About two months ago I talked with Dimi.

4
00:00:18,155 --> 00:00:19,375
I've got an idea.

5
00:00:21,745 --> 00:00:24,775
We want to do an escape room but totally not do an escape room.

6
00:00:24,960 --> 00:00:26,900
It seems to be successful.

7
00:00:27,800 --> 00:00:32,720
That's good. Please give me a room. Something bigger so we can do more stuff.

8
00:00:34,580 --> 00:00:35,900
I've invited my friends at Toool.

9
00:00:36,400 --> 00:00:39,440
Jan-Willem and Rob.

10
00:00:39,440 --> 00:00:40,879
And we have spend three Toool meet-ups on it?

11
00:00:41,160 --> 00:00:42,099
Something like that.

12
00:00:42,780 --> 00:00:47,600
We've all brought our own collection of weird stuff.
Thrown it together with some sick minds.

13
00:00:47,860 --> 00:00:51,240
This is the result.

14
00:00:51,400 --> 00:00:53,900
I want to have a camera person because we want to record everything.

15
00:00:54,085 --> 00:00:57,095
I forgot: we needed camera's.

16
00:00:57,480 --> 00:01:01,180
Dimi came with Duh... Events.

17
00:01:02,300 --> 00:01:06,940
Duh-Events borrowed us the camera hardware.

18
00:01:07,380 --> 00:01:10,520
This is what we've made it.

19
00:01:11,840 --> 00:01:14,180
Yes! Every team was invited to room 9 for a briefing.

20
00:01:15,100 --> 00:01:18,039
But the Room was in room 11.

21
00:01:18,580 --> 00:01:19,760
The Briefing.

22
00:01:21,980 --> 00:01:22,980
One moment.

23
00:01:25,060 --> 00:01:33,240
The briefing included a standard NDA. Your first living son and the usual.

24
00:01:33,740 --> 00:01:36,759
In the document was also a short explanation of the story.

25
00:01:36,760 --> 00:01:40,340
Not too much. We did not want to spoil it.

26
00:01:40,860 --> 00:01:44,960
The story is: We, who 'we' are is never explained.

27
00:01:45,480 --> 00:01:48,715
We are on a pursuit of a man.

28
00:01:48,720 --> 00:01:51,260
'Man and 'he' are the words we used. A few times.

29
00:01:51,740 --> 00:01:54,820
This man is up to no good.

30
00:01:55,140 --> 00:01:58,540
And we did not know where he was, we do now! He is in the room next door.

31
00:01:58,825 --> 00:02:00,435
In a moment your and your team mates

32
00:02:00,865 --> 00:02:02,645
Go into the Room

33
00:02:02,645 --> 00:02:05,615
We know the guy is a smoker and he's due for a smoke. He'll be gone for seven whole minutes.

34
00:02:05,615 --> 00:02:08,835
You have this time to go trough the room.

35
00:02:08,835 --> 00:02:11,005
And you'll have to find as much information as possible.

36
00:02:11,400 --> 00:02:16,240
The room will have to be exactly the same when you leave as when you entered.

37
00:02:16,380 --> 00:02:17,740
If not he'll know he has been had. (And the whole operation is burned.)

38
00:02:17,855 --> 00:02:20,704
We expect this person.

39
00:02:20,865 --> 00:02:24,285
Is being followed by other agencies.

40
00:02:24,405 --> 00:02:25,405
So. It's possible.

41
00:02:25,720 --> 00:02:28,760
That you'll find recording devices.

42
00:02:29,120 --> 00:02:32,420
If this is the case: Leave it but document it.

43
00:02:33,020 --> 00:02:37,060
We have multiple camera's for infra. For the Jury.

44
00:02:37,540 --> 00:02:42,120
These are off limits. These camera's are not there.

45
00:02:43,640 --> 00:02:46,355
This it about what we've explained to the teams.

46
00:02:46,360 --> 00:02:50,060
Apart from the fact: WE have no key from the room.

47
00:02:50,780 --> 00:02:53,480
So we searched for a tool.

48
00:02:54,155 --> 00:02:57,035
The fun was: Everyone who used the tool.

49
00:02:57,035 --> 00:02:59,045
From them no-one had used it before!

50
00:02:59,605 --> 00:03:00,605
This was awesome!

51
00:03:02,175 --> 00:03:03,765
This is an under the door tool.

52
00:03:04,995 --> 00:03:08,225
And as the name implies: it goes under the door.

53
00:03:09,280 --> 00:03:12,640
With it you fish for the door handle.

54
00:03:12,760 --> 00:03:15,720
You pull it down and push the door open.

55
00:03:16,505 --> 00:03:18,785
Some have never used this tool before.

56
00:03:18,785 --> 00:03:21,815
And we have seen results of 20 seconds.

57
00:03:21,815 --> 00:03:24,765
Hello hotel door...

58
00:03:24,765 --> 00:03:27,179
Some teams required three minutes.

59
00:03:27,380 --> 00:03:29,280
It's all about the idea. We have a video.

60
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:35,000
Magic.

61
00:03:49,895 --> 00:03:51,485
That's correct, that's not possible at this moment.

62
00:04:03,945 --> 00:04:05,655
You can do it. You can do it. Yes!

63
00:04:07,845 --> 00:04:09,025
Good Job!

64
00:04:10,385 --> 00:04:11,575
This is the wrong video.

65
00:04:23,475 --> 00:04:26,885
We where still writing up to 15 minutes ago.

66
00:05:14,475 --> 00:05:15,475
There we go!

67
00:05:21,065 --> 00:05:24,425
Some rabble had quite a few badges that did hotel tags.

68
00:05:24,440 --> 00:05:26,120
But they keep trying...

69
00:05:26,520 --> 00:05:30,599
Look, another tag. Beep beep. Another one.

70
00:05:30,935 --> 00:05:32,595
Copy of this and copy of that.

71
00:05:35,060 --> 00:05:37,880
What Dimi is doing here with the magnifier? I don't know...

72
00:05:39,300 --> 00:05:42,760
You put the wire under the door.

73
00:05:43,705 --> 00:05:46,385
And you'll move it to the door handle. If you are too far it won't do anything.

74
00:05:46,655 --> 00:05:49,294
And the hinges on the bathroom door.

75
00:05:49,365 --> 00:05:51,835
Did not help either.

76
00:05:52,475 --> 00:05:54,945
This is a stream from the inside.

77
00:05:55,405 --> 00:05:58,515
Miss. This! Awesome isn't it?

78
00:06:02,135 --> 00:06:03,905
And now... Dun Dun..

79
00:06:09,065 --> 00:06:10,395
You understand it now, right?

80
00:06:16,780 --> 00:06:19,559
This was the under the door tool video.

81
00:06:20,140 --> 00:06:24,280
And now you are in a completely normal hotel room.

82
00:06:25,320 --> 00:06:28,165
Except left and right a few camera's. These are not usually there.

83
00:06:28,165 --> 00:06:29,525
This kind of device.

84
00:06:29,935 --> 00:06:30,935
These you'll have to ignore.

85
00:06:31,380 --> 00:06:38,500
When you enter the room you'll find a set of keys.

86
00:06:41,400 --> 00:06:45,419
If you walk straight ahead. This is the first camera you'll find.

87
00:06:46,420 --> 00:06:48,900
This was under the table.

88
00:06:49,125 --> 00:06:51,385
Pointing towards the door.

89
00:06:52,595 --> 00:06:55,395
4k everything as usual.

90
00:06:55,395 --> 00:06:57,375
Some place further you'll find.

91
00:06:58,155 --> 00:07:01,234
Paper with a pen. This is a camera.

92
00:07:03,080 --> 00:07:04,080
Yes No!

93
00:07:04,880 --> 00:07:05,880
Yes!

94
00:07:13,575 --> 00:07:16,465
That's for later! And continue!

95
00:07:16,465 --> 00:07:19,565
It is indeed a camera.

96
00:07:19,905 --> 00:07:22,844
When you look further you'll find a sealed envelope.

97
00:07:23,255 --> 00:07:24,605
Nope, this is not a camera.

98
00:07:25,335 --> 00:07:28,294
When you hold it to the light.

99
00:07:28,295 --> 00:07:29,355
You can see writing.

100
00:07:29,705 --> 00:07:32,715
It's also not a perfectly sealed.

101
00:07:34,140 --> 00:07:37,080
It was only locked at the seal.

102
00:07:37,080 --> 00:07:40,320
So when you rotate the letter.

103
00:07:40,700 --> 00:07:44,395
You could remove the note and place it back.

104
00:07:44,395 --> 00:07:47,034
One of the teams did do this. In the second run so does not count.

105
00:07:47,040 --> 00:07:49,160
But very clever!

106
00:07:49,320 --> 00:07:51,500
The super secret phrase was:

107
00:07:52,160 --> 00:07:54,020
Phrase: "Can't send me"

108
00:07:56,365 --> 00:07:59,135
Someone used this to..

109
00:08:01,955 --> 00:08:04,365
Find the age of the subject.

110
00:08:04,365 --> 00:08:07,245
Because it was pointing to: 'can send me'.

111
00:08:07,245 --> 00:08:10,045
And then you have an age.

112
00:08:10,045 --> 00:08:13,075
If you look further you'll find a key card. FRom a totally different hotel.

113
00:08:13,075 --> 00:08:15,505
These can be useful...

114
00:08:15,505 --> 00:08:18,040
These are all things we have placed in the room.

115
00:08:18,660 --> 00:08:20,940
Not all was necessary and it was a lot.

116
00:08:20,940 --> 00:08:23,200
You could not have done everything in seven minutes.

117
00:08:23,300 --> 00:08:25,680
How good you where. It was the idea.

118
00:08:25,800 --> 00:08:28,080
That's the idea: You go in, panic, panic and out of the room again.

119
00:08:28,260 --> 00:08:32,500
If you look on the table you'll find pills and a hand thingimejiig.

120
00:08:34,280 --> 00:08:38,600
We did have some ideas: Those pulls are on strips.

121
00:08:39,580 --> 00:08:44,000
And if you interpret it as a binary plane. You can put information there.

122
00:08:46,540 --> 00:08:47,540
Yes yes!

123
00:08:47,995 --> 00:08:51,025
I don't know if it counts.. Nobody done so.

124
00:08:51,025 --> 00:08:54,155
So we can tell you we have not done that.

125
00:08:54,155 --> 00:08:55,865
This is a terrible photo.

126
00:08:56,395 --> 00:08:59,135
On the screen it's better.

127
00:08:59,315 --> 00:09:00,315
This is a...

128
00:09:00,680 --> 00:09:04,055
A complete. This is behind the television.

129
00:09:04,060 --> 00:09:07,060
This is a complete cellphone. You can call it and it will answer.

130
00:09:07,060 --> 00:09:09,964
And will record everything that's happening inside.

131
00:09:09,965 --> 00:09:12,505
That's just a lipo battery.

132
00:09:12,660 --> 00:09:15,199
And it was behind the television. hidden in plane sight.

133
00:09:15,340 --> 00:09:18,320
But the colour matches. What you might think: What's there? It was not found by everyone.

134
00:09:19,160 --> 00:09:21,000
And then there was a PC...

135
00:09:22,420 --> 00:09:25,099
This PC was running a really old version of backtrack.

136
00:09:29,400 --> 00:09:32,280
This PC did things with GPS.

137
00:09:32,440 --> 00:09:35,360
These where not there because we where inside.

138
00:09:35,365 --> 00:09:38,395
This was not a problem as the PC was not important.

139
00:09:40,940 --> 00:09:45,040
If you'd look outside from where you where standing. There was a camera.

140
00:09:47,940 --> 00:09:53,640
And interestingly. The way to hide a camera is to glue it to the middle of the window.

141
00:09:54,760 --> 00:09:57,040
This one is never reported to us!

142
00:10:00,095 --> 00:10:01,885
Really cool!

143
00:10:02,695 --> 00:10:04,835
If you look further you'll find.

144
00:10:05,165 --> 00:10:07,685
A few books.

145
00:10:07,685 --> 00:10:09,494
Used for profiling.

146
00:10:09,975 --> 00:10:13,035
From forein languages.

147
00:10:13,035 --> 00:10:15,935
In the drawer was some recreational other stuff.

148
00:10:15,935 --> 00:10:18,305
And if you'd dig deeper you'd find this.

149
00:10:18,995 --> 00:10:20,505
This thing was stuck under the drawer.

150
00:10:21,265 --> 00:10:24,205
This is a phone for a special place.

151
00:10:24,865 --> 00:10:26,795
Don't lick is good advice in this case.

152
00:10:28,035 --> 00:10:29,035
About this size.

153
00:10:30,175 --> 00:10:33,495
Example, it does not have a vibration mode. I don't know why not.

154
00:10:33,900 --> 00:10:38,020
If we go right from there and look under the mattress.

155
00:10:38,360 --> 00:10:39,960
There was a folder.

156
00:10:40,500 --> 00:10:42,400
Not alot of teams found it.

157
00:10:42,935 --> 00:10:45,574
That was quite odd as you could guess it was there. Or et least I think so.

158
00:10:45,575 --> 00:10:47,195
Diceware, crypto...

159
00:10:47,855 --> 00:10:50,205
Password generation stuff.

160
00:10:50,205 --> 00:10:53,535
Did I use all buzzwords? (Blockchain) Yes?

161
00:10:53,540 --> 00:10:56,280
You get it right? Diceware cyber cyber everything.

162
00:10:56,360 --> 00:10:59,375
It was quite a big pile of documents and you have people. It was quite a big stack.

163
00:10:59,375 --> 00:11:02,235
One team managed to photograph all the pages.

164
00:11:04,275 --> 00:11:05,875
OCD FTW!

165
00:11:07,740 --> 00:11:09,040
Shoot everything.

166
00:11:09,280 --> 00:11:14,220
In the upper left corner you'll see a suitcase.

167
00:11:14,860 --> 00:11:17,855
This was under the bed and it has a combination lock.

168
00:11:17,855 --> 00:11:20,725
What's the first code you would try?

169
00:11:21,575 --> 00:11:22,575
000 = Root!

170
00:11:24,115 --> 00:11:25,155
And then it opens.

171
00:11:25,845 --> 00:11:28,975
There was some trash inside. Stamps.

172
00:11:28,980 --> 00:11:32,280
Someone did think this was a passport. But it's a folder from the AIVD.

173
00:11:32,280 --> 00:11:35,880
Explaining why it's a bad idea to not leave your passport unattended.

174
00:11:35,880 --> 00:11:38,885
In the back was a Falk map of the Netherlands.

175
00:11:38,885 --> 00:11:40,035
We will get back to it shortly.

176
00:11:40,375 --> 00:11:42,935
What else was underneath the table.

177
00:11:42,940 --> 00:11:44,980
Under the bad was a.

178
00:11:45,540 --> 00:11:48,719
Lips piece safe tray.

179
00:11:49,140 --> 00:11:50,900
This can open.

180
00:11:51,380 --> 00:11:53,860
There was a tube inside.

181
00:11:54,120 --> 00:11:56,720
Quite a lot of people told us it was empty.

182
00:11:57,240 --> 00:11:58,520
That was almost correct.

183
00:11:59,040 --> 00:12:01,439
Beside this piece of plastic.

184
00:12:01,480 --> 00:12:03,060
If you review it. It will look like this.

185
00:12:04,480 --> 00:12:07,120
Dots and a target.

186
00:12:07,465 --> 00:12:10,115
And did we find a map.

187
00:12:11,615 --> 00:12:14,655
If you put the red dot.

188
00:12:14,655 --> 00:12:17,675
Not the one of the laser but the point on the screen.

189
00:12:17,675 --> 00:12:20,555
If you put this one on here (Garderen).

190
00:12:20,555 --> 00:12:22,745
Than you might expect Almere is the target.

191
00:12:23,905 --> 00:12:25,155
If you do it right.

192
00:12:26,115 --> 00:12:30,105
And the red dot leave. But...

193
00:12:30,135 --> 00:12:33,135
It has to be this way, unfocussed.

194
00:12:33,135 --> 00:12:35,985
If you put the dots on the known hacker spaces.

195
00:12:35,985 --> 00:12:39,105
Than you'll get the target: Huizen.

196
00:12:41,155 --> 00:12:43,145
Huizen is the target. Remember this!

197
00:12:43,560 --> 00:12:48,300
When checking the tray you'll find a pouch.

198
00:12:48,860 --> 00:12:52,720
The more elderly know there is a key inside. We will come back to this.

199
00:12:54,280 --> 00:12:58,500
The night stand on the right you'd find this kind of trash.

200
00:12:58,940 --> 00:13:01,860
Power bank with a cable.

201
00:13:02,075 --> 00:13:03,655
This is a camera.

202
00:13:04,255 --> 00:13:08,245
And the USB cable is a phone.

203
00:13:10,965 --> 00:13:13,685
This one is scary. Really scary.

204
00:13:15,955 --> 00:13:17,405
Yes, sick!

205
00:13:19,020 --> 00:13:23,079
You call this phone from a white list and answers.

206
00:13:23,540 --> 00:13:26,380
Come here. This is simply sick.

207
00:13:32,265 --> 00:13:36,485
A bit further some other toys and stuff.

208
00:13:37,240 --> 00:13:41,940
Not everything was needed but there was a Bible. Some people told us: 'It's a hotel Bible.'

209
00:13:42,340 --> 00:13:43,900
Your room did not have a Bible.

210
00:13:44,380 --> 00:13:50,005
This is not the hotel Bible. Just a random Bible. Useful for key generation.

211
00:13:50,005 --> 00:13:52,325
And to wrap train tickets.

212
00:13:53,175 --> 00:14:00,005
Completely unimportant. If you look further you'll find cigarette paper with a super secret number.

213
00:14:00,445 --> 00:14:01,995
This number is of the safe.

214
00:14:03,135 --> 00:14:04,135
The safe.

215
00:14:04,605 --> 00:14:10,915
This opens and you'd find some electronics. You are not allowed to put anything interesting in a hotel room safe.

216
00:14:11,565 --> 00:14:12,565
Because they are trash.

217
00:14:14,825 --> 00:14:17,255
Back to the night stand.

218
00:14:17,905 --> 00:14:23,415
Many have seen: There was a black cylinder.

219
00:14:23,715 --> 00:14:26,365
The technical term is: Flash light.

220
00:14:27,645 --> 00:14:29,855
With a different colour light.

221
00:14:30,825 --> 00:14:35,125
I've seen people check the whole room.

222
00:14:35,940 --> 00:14:38,520
But forgot to check the bathroom.

223
00:14:42,300 --> 00:14:46,520
Bathroom, there we did do something.

224
00:14:53,700 --> 00:14:59,385
We've had teams that completely forgot it was there. Here is a door and continue.

225
00:15:00,485 --> 00:15:03,185
This is a picture from within.

226
00:15:03,945 --> 00:15:07,965
Some people had something like: Do I need to enter? WTF?

227
00:15:08,815 --> 00:15:14,935
Picture and back. And think: 'hihi'

228
00:15:18,595 --> 00:15:21,375
We have no sound so I have to do the effects.

229
00:15:21,555 --> 00:15:22,555
Really funny.

230
00:15:22,975 --> 00:15:25,665
Come look! Come look. What is this?

231
00:15:26,720 --> 00:15:31,240
We have made it slightly dextery. Crime scene like stuff.

232
00:15:32,160 --> 00:15:34,640
This was mister de Winter.

233
00:15:36,255 --> 00:15:40,045
There he goes. Picture picture.

234
00:15:40,995 --> 00:15:42,795
Document everything. Selfie, yes!

235
00:15:48,835 --> 00:15:52,015
Of course, only take pictures of suspicious things.

236
00:15:54,305 --> 00:15:57,625
There we go. Germ phobia to the max. Totally legit.

237
00:15:58,555 --> 00:16:01,334
We'll get back to it. Playing cards.

238
00:16:03,735 --> 00:16:04,735
This is with detour?

239
00:16:05,465 --> 00:16:06,465
This is with detour?

240
00:16:06,525 --> 00:16:07,525
Almost.

241
00:16:08,625 --> 00:16:11,115
Polish polish. Better than it was before.

242
00:16:11,665 --> 00:16:12,665
No fingerprints.

243
00:16:14,175 --> 00:16:16,145
Yes, that was good.

244
00:16:16,145 --> 00:16:20,755
When you left the briefing room there was a box of gloves. You could have asked for one...

245
00:16:31,885 --> 00:16:34,775
Where is Brenno? There is Brenno!

246
00:17:11,385 --> 00:17:12,605
The flash light was useful.

247
00:17:14,214 --> 00:17:16,935
These where the chemicals of the attack!

248
00:17:17,785 --> 00:17:18,785
Could discover.

249
00:17:19,075 --> 00:17:21,305
Caffeine and alcohol.

250
00:17:21,724 --> 00:17:23,754
So in Huizen was a party!

251
00:17:27,015 --> 00:17:29,045
Nobody found this!

252
00:17:30,045 --> 00:17:32,725
What some have found in our shower.

253
00:17:33,065 --> 00:17:36,145
One team dropped the marker.

254
00:17:37,115 --> 00:17:38,505
This was found.

255
00:17:39,805 --> 00:17:43,905
We should have cleaned it better. With different stuff you do not find in a hotel room.

256
00:17:46,085 --> 00:17:48,035
This was not all. There was more!

257
00:17:48,495 --> 00:17:51,554
Brenno was really close to an RSI key.

258
00:17:52,105 --> 00:17:53,525
RSA key.

259
00:17:54,965 --> 00:17:58,524
Some people found this odd or totally not.

260
00:17:58,840 --> 00:18:01,600
I find a deck of cards in the shower quite odd.

261
00:18:02,860 --> 00:18:03,860
Don't know.

262
00:18:04,120 --> 00:18:09,000
Yes, it was sealed. But after it was opened.

263
00:18:09,880 --> 00:18:11,900
If you check a deck of cards.

264
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:13,995
Than you can.

265
00:18:13,995 --> 00:18:19,594
Only with normal and flipped cards, You would have a binary system to put information in.

266
00:18:19,745 --> 00:18:23,745
And I would like you to search for Solitaire crypto. That's a lot of fun!

267
00:18:25,655 --> 00:18:28,345
Cryptonimicon has wrote a small chapter on it.

268
00:18:28,505 --> 00:18:33,335
If you go back to the room. There are who...

269
00:18:34,315 --> 00:18:35,615
The closet.

270
00:18:36,035 --> 00:18:38,865
Closet is off limits.

271
00:18:38,865 --> 00:18:43,365
There you'd find typical clothes.

272
00:18:44,020 --> 00:18:45,020
And a suitcase.

273
00:18:45,400 --> 00:18:49,720
The suitcase was not locked. And inside was a smaller suitcase with a lock.

274
00:18:49,920 --> 00:18:53,140
We are from Toool and take locks serious.

275
00:18:53,780 --> 00:18:57,060
That's no problem. We found the keys. But also a USB drive.

276
00:18:57,105 --> 00:18:59,905
And car keys? Nope, it's a camera.

277
00:19:06,805 --> 00:19:12,965
Protec keys to open. There was a mask.

278
00:19:13,040 --> 00:19:14,040
There for.

279
00:19:14,720 --> 00:19:16,680
The odd clothes.

280
00:19:17,360 --> 00:19:21,274
If you look behind the pillow you'll find a cash box.

281
00:19:21,755 --> 00:19:25,065
With the key we found in the past.

282
00:19:25,675 --> 00:19:28,575
Payment device whatchamacallit. Cards.

283
00:19:29,095 --> 00:19:31,645
Then there was a pillow.

284
00:19:31,645 --> 00:19:36,655
You where allowed to look. It's the modern equivalent of a horse head: 'We will cut your power'

285
00:19:39,745 --> 00:19:42,854
Oldies between us. Dumpster diving is a thing!

286
00:19:42,855 --> 00:19:45,675
Here where some recipes.

287
00:19:45,675 --> 00:19:51,205
If you remove the bag you find a case. with a flat phone.

288
00:19:51,295 --> 00:19:53,585
And some international sim cards.

289
00:19:54,495 --> 00:19:57,314
He is one of us as he drinks Club Mate.

290
00:19:58,145 --> 00:20:02,135
Remember the NDA from the beginning?

291
00:20:02,225 --> 00:20:03,925
That's a camera! :)

292
00:20:07,725 --> 00:20:12,004
You are wrong. I've a NDA signed, clearly delegated.

293
00:20:14,245 --> 00:20:15,245
Your turn.

294
00:20:18,015 --> 00:20:19,115
Don't breath!

295
00:20:25,115 --> 00:20:27,145
About things that go wrong...

296
00:20:28,020 --> 00:20:29,020
This was the Room.

297
00:20:29,700 --> 00:20:33,540
The control room and where we go to.

298
00:20:34,580 --> 00:20:40,300
Recap of The Room: 8 teams, 50 people, each 7 minutes.

299
00:20:40,435 --> 00:20:42,645
And exactly zero gloves used.

300
00:20:43,675 --> 00:20:46,965
Zo enough fingerprints.

301
00:20:46,965 --> 00:20:50,754
Bonus points for Brenno. In the bathroom he used a tissue.

302
00:20:51,575 --> 00:20:54,115
To open all the things. drawers and stuff.

303
00:20:54,120 --> 00:20:57,280
But he used a tissue from the same bathroom.

304
00:20:58,160 --> 00:21:00,840
Bit, he did not throw the tissue in one of our bins.

305
00:21:01,635 --> 00:21:02,754
Bonus points.

306
00:21:04,825 --> 00:21:08,765
We had gloves (They where there on purpose.) But no-one asked one.

307
00:21:10,715 --> 00:21:17,185
The most important exercise: Leave nothing behind.

308
00:21:17,675 --> 00:21:23,725
So the most points reduced was for when things are changed.

309
00:21:24,115 --> 00:21:26,805
Things that where left on a different spot.

310
00:21:26,845 --> 00:21:28,735
Things that changed. Moved.

311
00:21:29,245 --> 00:21:33,195
We have also reduced points for people who took things from the room.

312
00:21:33,985 --> 00:21:36,094
That's a risk. Even for trash.

313
00:21:36,875 --> 00:21:39,975
Yes, technically.

314
00:21:40,240 --> 00:21:45,180
Someone found something in the trash. Note, interesting I take it with me.

315
00:21:45,360 --> 00:21:51,459
You never know what someone is going to do. Takes it's own trash and burns it.

316
00:21:51,560 --> 00:21:53,659
That's a risk. Everything you take with you is a risk.

317
00:21:54,100 --> 00:21:58,060
But more fun is when you find something.

318
00:22:03,300 --> 00:22:06,399
These are not my glasses!

319
00:22:07,540 --> 00:22:09,159
In the middle of the room.

320
00:22:12,395 --> 00:22:17,615
It's important to sweep the room for things left behind. Have we taken everything?

321
00:22:18,835 --> 00:22:20,315
Yes!

322
00:22:25,025 --> 00:22:30,165
But also important our subject was quite OCD.

323
00:22:30,895 --> 00:22:35,195
The flash light was in the corner and upright.

324
00:22:35,605 --> 00:22:41,345
The power bank was more on the centre and pointed towards the mirror.

325
00:22:41,345 --> 00:22:44,595
Every small detail can burn your operation.

326
00:22:45,645 --> 00:22:47,425
This pen was.

327
00:22:48,075 --> 00:22:50,135
On top of the envelop.

328
00:22:50,745 --> 00:22:55,665
But they where not the only team that did this wrong. This one was also wrong. It was more to the wall.

329
00:22:56,025 --> 00:22:58,295
And you have that with someone with OCD.

330
00:22:59,035 --> 00:23:03,015
A short quiz question for those that use Linux.

331
00:23:03,015 --> 00:23:05,955
If you want to use a commando and type it again if you used it in the past.

332
00:23:05,960 --> 00:23:09,005
What do you do? type it again?

333
00:23:09,005 --> 00:23:12,200
Hit the up arrow hundred times to find it in you Bash history?

334
00:23:17,960 --> 00:23:22,185
It's a risk when you type things on an open laptop.

335
00:23:28,425 --> 00:23:31,764
It will all be in the history.

336
00:23:35,725 --> 00:23:41,435
But we don't mind you opening documents.

337
00:23:41,435 --> 00:23:43,845
Even if you have to know better.

338
00:23:43,845 --> 00:23:49,915
There is a history to find old history.

339
00:23:49,920 --> 00:23:53,280
But the last command was history...

340
00:23:54,180 --> 00:23:58,800
There was nothing worthwhile on the laptop.

341
00:23:59,020 --> 00:24:02,040
If you'd ask what's in the 'flipping tables.txt': (╯°□°）╯︵ ┻━┻

342
00:24:02,860 --> 00:24:04,639
That was not worth while.

343
00:24:07,525 --> 00:24:10,715
And if you take the risk to type commands.

344
00:24:10,715 --> 00:24:13,445
Don't forget to clear the window.

345
00:24:14,675 --> 00:24:20,975
We returned to one laptop and the console had all the output from the last team.

346
00:24:21,155 --> 00:24:23,645
You've burned the mission.

347
00:24:25,185 --> 00:24:30,365
These where the biggest mistakes. You leave te PC be.

348
00:24:30,365 --> 00:24:35,480
A laptop that's open is nothing different than a honey pot. If it's not your job to copy the PC.

349
00:24:35,980 --> 00:24:40,120
Take a picture that it's unlocked. Find something on the workspace?

350
00:24:40,120 --> 00:24:43,840
A few teams spend time on what we could see on the screen.

351
00:24:44,300 --> 00:24:46,595
A photo of the output.

352
00:24:46,595 --> 00:24:49,665
Photo of visible icons. Don't touch it.

353
00:24:49,885 --> 00:24:53,225
You never know if one or another.

354
00:24:53,595 --> 00:24:56,585
Cronjob on the background is logging keystrokes.

355
00:24:56,585 --> 00:24:59,145
Keylogger or alike.

356
00:24:59,280 --> 00:25:02,480
You never know how forensic capable your opponent is.

357
00:25:02,480 --> 00:25:06,515
The person you are researching can counter research you.

358
00:25:06,935 --> 00:25:08,905
So.

359
00:25:09,875 --> 00:25:15,055
That's with all stuff. Put it back where you found it. Take a picture at the beginning.

360
00:25:15,585 --> 00:25:19,785
Research the device. wipe it down and return it.

361
00:25:20,795 --> 00:25:22,495
That's it.

362
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:30,340
I don't need the laptop.

363
00:25:30,340 --> 00:25:32,399
I've got some prices.

364
00:25:32,765 --> 00:25:35,215
Nothing is fun without prices.

365
00:25:35,215 --> 00:25:40,985
The budget was quite small so we have all random crap used in the room.

366
00:25:41,360 --> 00:25:44,240
For this occasion I've got gloves for myself.

367
00:25:51,040 --> 00:25:56,399
[Who could have known these gloves are not easy to use...]

368
00:26:11,360 --> 00:26:12,399
We had a UV lamp.

369
00:26:31,680 --> 00:26:33,200
Nooooo!

370
00:26:35,360 --> 00:26:38,080
Did you need it? No!

371
00:26:41,680 --> 00:26:46,785
In the laptop bag. I'm not taking it home.

372
00:26:47,175 --> 00:26:53,915
Duck tape. files, someone put them in the lock, that was not nice.

373
00:26:55,355 --> 00:26:59,225
Deck of cards so you can play with Solitaire encryption.

374
00:27:00,665 --> 00:27:06,274
UV kit/paint, All a lot of fun.

375
00:27:06,545 --> 00:27:09,525
Don't try at home.

376
00:27:09,795 --> 00:27:12,865
A hazmatsuit or something similar.

377
00:27:17,585 --> 00:27:18,895
This is from three days ago.

378
00:27:22,725 --> 00:27:26,975
Pens that could do something...

379
00:27:28,355 --> 00:27:31,595
Microsoft butplug pens as discribed by Jos.

380
00:27:32,355 --> 00:27:34,115
Cleaning stuff.

381
00:27:38,365 --> 00:27:41,645
A random set of sunglasses. Where did this one come from?

382
00:27:43,355 --> 00:27:44,365
A lockpickset?

383
00:27:44,985 --> 00:27:49,764
There is also a lockpicking set. I've forgot it.

384
00:27:52,165 --> 00:27:55,825
This is sadly only for the first price. Or better?

385
00:27:55,985 --> 00:27:57,844
Good for... Ok.

386
00:28:00,445 --> 00:28:06,304
For the 3rd place we got Team CyberHotel. It's the team from Dimi and did it very well!

387
00:28:06,305 --> 00:28:11,175
They've left almost no evidence. Fantastic!

388
00:28:11,505 --> 00:28:14,105
They've found less than the others.

389
00:28:14,725 --> 00:28:20,695
On the 2nd place we have team DankYoloSwag1million for the best name.

390
00:28:21,375 --> 00:28:23,155
They did out preform the rest.

391
00:28:23,595 --> 00:28:28,335
I don't know what they did or didn't. Something was wrong.

392
00:28:29,985 --> 00:28:34,814
For the first place that's sadly: deFeest.

393
00:28:37,995 --> 00:28:39,645
Come and get your prices.

394
00:28:41,120 --> 00:28:43,120
We will have to take the case.

395
00:28:43,120 --> 00:28:44,320
Can I give you a hand? [Never mind...]

396
00:28:52,505 --> 00:28:54,725
We want to say some word of thanks.

397
00:28:54,725 --> 00:28:59,520
We have prepared for the job by knowing each other for the past 10 years.

398
00:28:59,520 --> 00:29:06,345
We have not prepared at all. We had a small team but there was no Brenno under our feet.

399
00:29:06,735 --> 00:29:11,245
Not that we found anything useful. But there was no Brenno..

400
00:29:11,245 --> 00:29:16,834
Everything OCD. Capture all the things. Every page. Every ticket.

401
00:29:16,835 --> 00:29:19,625
Books, page numbers. how they are arranged.

402
00:29:20,895 --> 00:29:23,645
Yes and then check if you'd done so correctly.

403
00:29:23,645 --> 00:29:26,165
Comparing pictures.

404
00:29:26,165 --> 00:29:29,225
I've not send them, sorry.

405
00:29:29,225 --> 00:29:31,155
I've taken 850 photographs.

406
00:29:34,245 --> 00:29:36,584
Take a picture of everything!

407
00:29:36,585 --> 00:29:39,355
In seven minutes.

408
00:29:41,395 --> 00:29:44,835
Yes, now I need to buy a new SD card. This one is filled up.

409
00:29:45,625 --> 00:29:48,465
That you!

410
00:29:48,545 --> 00:29:52,635
It was a great experience. Very good, well done. Thank you!

411
00:29:57,175 --> 00:29:58,544
Thank you for your attention.

412
00:30:02,135 --> 00:30:04,615
Thank you for your attention.

413
00:30:05,355 --> 00:30:11,315
As you might expect this has been improvised. The talk is too.

414
00:30:11,315 --> 00:30:15,185
Thank you for the time slot.

415
00:30:16,965 --> 00:30:20,865
The Social engineering experience has been moved.

416
00:30:21,015 --> 00:30:22,015
That one is now!

417
00:30:22,315 --> 00:30:26,145
I'll give the stage to him. (him = Marcel.)

418
00:30:26,945 --> 00:30:28,725
See you next year!
