00:00:05,920 --> 00:00:08,660
 Welcome everyone to the great Badge Talk 

2
00:00:08,660 --> 00:00:12,650
 by the Badge Team Welcome Anne-Jan and Sebastius 

3
00:00:12,650 --> 00:00:14,650
 but don't forget Tom, Rense and Bas either 

4
00:00:14,650 --> 00:00:20,966
 And Bugblue 

5
00:00:20,966 --> 00:00:26,510
 Welcome 

6
00:00:26,510 --> 00:00:31,340
 The working title was already submitted before we actually ... 

7
00:00:31,340 --> 00:00:38,180
 had started working hard on the badge. However, this title fits 

8
00:00:38,180 --> 00:00:41,570
 How we failed to make the badge, but still succeeded 

9
00:00:41,570 --> 00:00:48,350
 But let's start with our previous attempts. 

10
00:00:48,350 --> 00:00:54,050
 We had the SHA2017 Event, which we more than 

11
00:00:54,050 --> 00:00:58,669
 4000 badges have made of which 2000 are activated on the camp 

12
00:00:58,670 --> 00:01:05,780
 People created more than 256 apps for the badge during the event, and many more later. 

13
00:01:05,780 --> 00:01:10,369
 (noise) I am that (Sebas) Probably the flame thrower caught. 

14
00:01:10,369 --> 00:01:17,810
 Anyway, many people have interesting ones 

15
00:01:17,810 --> 00:01:22,069
 apps made on hatchery, the app store for badge applications. 

16
00:01:22,069 --> 00:01:29,479
 During and after SHA2017. We also have some OTA updates 

17
00:01:29,479 --> 00:01:33,410
 with mainly work by Bas van Sisseren. 

18
00:01:33,410 --> 00:01:39,920
 on points such as Font anti-aliasing to name a few 

19
00:01:39,920 --> 00:01:45,800
 That was during the previous HackerHotel and we were still working on that badge. 

20
00:01:45,800 --> 00:01:51,920
 So when there was an idea to work on a hacker hotel badge 

21
00:01:51,920 --> 00:01:56,539
 it was very natural to continue on the basis that was set. 

22
00:01:56,539 --> 00:01:59,410
 The funny thing is ... (more outside noise) 

23
00:02:01,850 --> 00:02:07,070
 I love those sound effects. It's funny ... 

24
00:02:07,070 --> 00:02:12,200
 You can now find the badges everywhere in the Netherlands, and also in German hackerspaces. 

25
00:02:12,200 --> 00:02:15,350
 Almost all defective boards, or boards with issues ... 

26
00:02:15,350 --> 00:02:20,600
 were sent in large boxes to the various hackerspaces 

27
00:02:20,600 --> 00:02:25,790
 who had participated in sha2017 

28
00:02:25,790 --> 00:02:30,140
 Badges ended on hackerspace walls ... ... in projects 

29
00:02:30,140 --> 00:02:37,309
 there is the 'Smart Blockchain' in Hack42, an art gallery at Revspace, 

30
00:02:37,310 --> 00:02:40,430
 a weather display at Hackalot 

31
00:02:40,430 --> 00:02:45,500
 Everyone uses these little devices that we have built 

32
00:02:45,500 --> 00:02:55,489
 A sha badge was used to do a simulated mount-everest climb 

33
00:02:55,489 --> 00:02:59,840
 in a flat, Someone has climbed a few kilometers of stairs. 

34
00:02:59,840 --> 00:03:05,810
 and monitor his heartbeat and the like 

35
00:03:05,810 --> 00:03:12,920
 There has been a SHA badge in an MRI Scanner 

36
00:03:12,920 --> 00:03:18,708
 The ESP32 has a HAL-effect sensor and that is rather insensitive ... 

37
00:03:18,709 --> 00:03:26,630
 for magnets, * wave Roosted * Roosted had an internship for testing 

38
00:03:26,630 --> 00:03:32,329
 of a very powerful 7 Tesla MRI 

39
00:03:32,329 --> 00:03:37,760
 and has worked with people from Espressiv on the sensor 

40
00:03:37,760 --> 00:03:42,620
 to trigger in a serious magnetic field. 

41
00:03:43,200 --> 00:03:51,299
 And he is still working (has anything been measured) ... Talk to Roosted after this talk 

42
00:03:54,620 --> 00:03:55,130
 the presentation very much you and i think this is us 

43
00:03:55,130 --> 00:04:02,269
 yes so afterwards to show 2017 and dühring the build up t 'the hacker gets it on 

44
00:04:02,269 --> 00:04:07,130
 who had an interesting meeting with the batch that people 

45
00:04:07,130 --> 00:04:10,250

 use the words some chips here everytime and everybody just get set 

159
00:14:09,779 --> 00:14:15,059
 because it is this is what is up in it is from tick or urban took x-sync or

 very badge mother than in less than two hours 

176
00:15:27,460 --> 00:15:31,300
 especially the heart workshops for the flashing or the software be that have 

177
00:15:31,300 --> 00:15:36,520
 just a little bit after that speak if the software was and then please it 

178
00:15:36,520 --> 00:15:40,060
 preferably to the point where we could put in the bin 

179
00:15:40,060 --> 00:15:47,170
 yes you can not do the diet work too what makes you crazy about patchwork on charger 

180
00:15:47,170 --> 00:15:52,660
 the the port where the someone from a piece of pcb 

181
00:15:52,660 --> 00:15:59,740
 display yes just now and axel operation board in indiana do you do that 

182
00:15:59,740 --> 00:16:05,880
 for 500 meters or batch staff with the dmitry next white for ski 

183
00:16:06,670 --> 00:16:12,500
 it might not be used for commercial yes so you put it on nn married 

184
00:16:12,500 --> 00:16:17,960
 restarted play audio it will be founded i am like you 

185
00:16:17,960 --> 00:16:20,720
 remember a you have is missing lyme a tissue 

186
00:16:20,720 --> 00:16:28,490
 oh sorry speakers whose it is misleading if you have turned out to be 

187
00:16:28,490 --> 00:16:32,780
 that whoever you had accidentally reverse foot prints would measure poor degrees 

188
00:16:32,780 --> 00:16:37,550
 agree that audio connector along the back words in the sibi copy 

189
00:16:37,550 --> 00:16:43,099
 the footprint for the audio jack house a mouse stick your image and how is that 

190
00:16:43,100 --> 00:16:48,260
 is that they stick you this zero is the housing shortage you place I buy so there 

191
00:16:48,260 --> 00:16:52,850
 right behind it like who this 

192
00:16:52,850 --> 00:16:58,700
 yes so what what did i have a backup reverse mounting or the of the audio jack 

193
00:16:58,700 --> 00:17:02,710
 it says be reversed left and ground 

194
00:17:04,189 --> 00:17:08,390
 and how you chose a safe and interesting effect as specially for the intro show or 

195
00:17:08,390 --> 00:17:14,089
 the sponsor reaches a chip choo choo by wakko 

196
00:17:14,089 --> 00:17:18,409
 and that your house has a lot of middle and then some highlights in left and right 

197
00:17:18,410 --> 00:17:22,160
 so to have a modified by if you run it 

198
00:17:22,160 --> 00:17:29,570
 directly play the sponsor app will hear your music is on the right side and around the 

199
00:17:29,570 --> 00:17:34,100
 left side you will hear the difference so jazz the highlights 

200
00:17:34,100 --> 00:17:40,219
 it is an interesting effect that the design and the music are right on whom 

201
00:17:40,220 --> 00:17:45,890
 who who who I image prototyping for this before this before 

202
00:17:45,890 --> 00:17:50,090
 they're more efficient the badge eh it's a crude oil greenport 

203
00:17:50,090 --> 00:17:53,870
 in the in the sticker ben thank you want from josh groban 

204
00:17:53,870 --> 00:18:01,280
 reely sheet pile attract and bake briefly right yes this was really arbi and how 

205
00:18:01,280 --> 00:18:05,990
 arya this pool cheek and out test that audio and also harder for pin 

206
00:18:05,990 --> 00:18:09,710
 audio jack would report it was zaanse bit with it might just leave my audio 

207
00:18:09,710 --> 00:18:12,530
 connection yo 

208
00:18:12,530 --> 00:18:18,539
 he also tried my I want it so ok yes yes third well what we 

209
00:18:18,539 --> 00:18:24,299
 what to expect is that audio chip like that and yes it is French, I hope so 

210
00:18:24,299 --> 00:18:28,230
 open for them perfectly in software and view because you can fix in hardware 

211
00:18:28,230 --> 00:18:35,640
 Fiction software is subtle though or you take the air and just insert the audio 

212
00:18:35,640 --> 00:18:43,799
 and then take the right and left and right you gave floating ground and 

213
00:18:43,799 --> 00:18:49,559
 juliet mormel stereo sound for certain definition or stelvio or coffee 

214
00:18:49,559 --> 00:18:54,928
 pretty good but after the flat lee boss boss was know who did you 2 do that 

215
00:18:54,929 --> 00:18:58,169
 prefer brainstorming about bossche bol fixus 

216
00:18:58,169 --> 00:19:03,750

217
00:19:03,750 --> 00:19:07,590
 in word and an app and new yes I close it 

218
00:19:07,590 --> 00:19:11,580
 bright this out but can write a lot of different from arkansas beg and ferry 

219
00:19:11,580 --> 00:19:17,370
 generic mixer component and in the time that is then compiling and flashing that 

220
00:19:17,370 --> 00:19:22,739
 is then a weekend of experimenting with it so there are mixing controls in the 

221
00:19:22,740 --> 00:19:26,429
 audio part or the microsite and wherever you can you 

222

224
00:19:36,200 --> 00:19:40,020
