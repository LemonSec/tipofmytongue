1
00:00:06,300 --> 00:00:10,950
so this talk is gonna be in English for

2
00:00:08,730 --> 00:00:13,349
the recording purposes so I'm David

3
00:00:10,950 --> 00:00:17,880
welcome to my talk this talk is about

4
00:00:13,349 --> 00:00:21,500
hot sauce thank you thank you I'm a part

5
00:00:17,880 --> 00:00:25,080
of pixel bar space in Rotterdam and

6
00:00:21,500 --> 00:00:27,480
recently we visited CCC and before we

7
00:00:25,080 --> 00:00:30,269
visited other camps and congresses and I

8
00:00:27,480 --> 00:00:32,549
was always into like foods and well I

9
00:00:30,269 --> 00:00:36,390
love cooking who here loves cooking as

10
00:00:32,549 --> 00:00:36,930
well somebody who loves eating okay

11
00:00:36,390 --> 00:00:38,730
everybody

12
00:00:36,930 --> 00:00:42,570
great great then this is the talk for

13
00:00:38,730 --> 00:00:45,209
you but I was going to the food hacking

14
00:00:42,570 --> 00:00:48,930
base and on camps there's like a huge

15
00:00:45,210 --> 00:00:52,050
food culture so I started to do some

16
00:00:48,930 --> 00:00:55,410
experimenting myself as well and

17
00:00:52,050 --> 00:00:57,089
actually I wanted to make my own hot

18
00:00:55,410 --> 00:00:59,730
sauce because I also started to make

19
00:00:57,090 --> 00:01:01,469
some ramen if you don't know what ramen

20
00:00:59,730 --> 00:01:04,949
is it looks like the picture on the

21
00:01:01,469 --> 00:01:07,140
right it's basically a Japanese dish a

22
00:01:04,949 --> 00:01:09,298
broth or soup whatever you call with

23
00:01:07,140 --> 00:01:11,430
noodles but I wanted to give it some

24
00:01:09,299 --> 00:01:12,840
kick i spiced it up so I make my own hot

25
00:01:11,430 --> 00:01:16,260
sauce as well

26
00:01:12,840 --> 00:01:19,500
but during my time at CCC I got some

27
00:01:16,260 --> 00:01:22,170
inspiration from a few people namely

28
00:01:19,500 --> 00:01:24,600
Lata and she talked about fermentation

29
00:01:22,170 --> 00:01:27,720
in the fermentation process and it she

30
00:01:24,600 --> 00:01:30,360
got me triggered and she also like see

31
00:01:27,720 --> 00:01:33,179
see see it actually during end of

32
00:01:30,360 --> 00:01:36,479
December so it's a very cold season and

33
00:01:33,180 --> 00:01:39,570
it's not the best time to grow your own

34
00:01:36,479 --> 00:01:41,280
plants however I did it I wanted to

35
00:01:39,570 --> 00:01:42,869
start from scratch and grow my own

36
00:01:41,280 --> 00:01:45,540
peppers because the ingredients are the

37
00:01:42,869 --> 00:01:47,159
most important part of the hot sauce and

38
00:01:45,540 --> 00:01:50,430
there are just a few ingredients and I

39
00:01:47,159 --> 00:01:52,110
will explain that later so I started

40
00:01:50,430 --> 00:01:56,250
with winter sowing this concept is

41
00:01:52,110 --> 00:01:58,890
basically well creating like a small box

42
00:01:56,250 --> 00:02:00,479
where it regulates the temperature in

43
00:01:58,890 --> 00:02:02,549
the box you can put it outside it can be

44
00:02:00,479 --> 00:02:05,429
snowy it can be warm doesn't matter as

45
00:02:02,549 --> 00:02:07,469
long there are Sun lights and the plants

46
00:02:05,430 --> 00:02:07,979
and some water in there then you're all

47
00:02:07,469 --> 00:02:09,899
good to go

48
00:02:07,979 --> 00:02:11,760
and it's it's really great concept to

49
00:02:09,899 --> 00:02:13,440
start growing like in the end of

50
00:02:11,760 --> 00:02:16,890
December or January and grow your own

51
00:02:13,440 --> 00:02:18,030
peppers and I'll show you that where you

52
00:02:16,890 --> 00:02:20,850
get can get the pepper

53
00:02:18,030 --> 00:02:22,560
seats later but basically the process

54
00:02:20,850 --> 00:02:23,069
looks like this you have to me in the

55
00:02:22,560 --> 00:02:24,900
box

56
00:02:23,069 --> 00:02:28,859
I grew them and my balcony I didn't need

57
00:02:24,900 --> 00:02:33,959
a lot of space for them and they crew

58
00:02:28,860 --> 00:02:37,140
amazingly well so and this is obviously

59
00:02:33,959 --> 00:02:39,239
yeah the main ingredients in hot sauce

60
00:02:37,140 --> 00:02:40,980
so you just need very good peppers

61
00:02:39,239 --> 00:02:43,410
obviously you can get them in grocery

62
00:02:40,980 --> 00:02:46,079
stores but there they taste a bit dull

63
00:02:43,410 --> 00:02:47,730
and you don't want those you can

64
00:02:46,080 --> 00:02:50,489
experiment with lots of varieties

65
00:02:47,730 --> 00:02:53,070
obviously um so the most fun important

66
00:02:50,489 --> 00:02:54,989
part is to get your own own peppers and

67
00:02:53,070 --> 00:02:57,660
obviously this is a hacker conference so

68
00:02:54,989 --> 00:03:01,380
I also want to do some monitoring of the

69
00:02:57,660 --> 00:03:03,390
the peppers so I've created a sensor box

70
00:03:01,380 --> 00:03:06,150
and actually the sensor works I'm not a

71
00:03:03,390 --> 00:03:10,130
hardware expert nor I my food experts

72
00:03:06,150 --> 00:03:12,630
I just like to hobby but I created this

73
00:03:10,130 --> 00:03:19,920
sensor box which basically registers

74
00:03:12,630 --> 00:03:22,980
lights humidity and the temperature

75
00:03:19,920 --> 00:03:27,359
yes temperature so I can see what what

76
00:03:22,980 --> 00:03:30,649
happens to the peppers so actually less

77
00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:33,410
you're here on the hacker hotel I just

78
00:03:30,650 --> 00:03:36,380
wait what's happening

79
00:03:33,410 --> 00:03:38,340
that's last year in hacker hotel I

80
00:03:36,380 --> 00:03:41,790
visited the workshop on the things

81
00:03:38,340 --> 00:03:44,670
network and I started researching that

82
00:03:41,790 --> 00:03:47,340
and I created this basically this basic

83
00:03:44,670 --> 00:03:50,160
thing where I could monitor these

84
00:03:47,340 --> 00:03:52,290
peppers on my own and actually trigger

85
00:03:50,160 --> 00:03:54,780
an alert when the humidity gets too low

86
00:03:52,290 --> 00:03:57,870
so I knew what was happening and I got

87
00:03:54,780 --> 00:04:00,630
an alert last summer however it was so

88
00:03:57,870 --> 00:04:04,590
warm it was so so it wasn't really

89
00:04:00,630 --> 00:04:07,320
required to to get it inside the

90
00:04:04,590 --> 00:04:09,180
humidity was perfect so actually I it

91
00:04:07,320 --> 00:04:10,769
was basically useless so I wouldn't

92
00:04:09,180 --> 00:04:12,900
recommend doing this but it was fun to

93
00:04:10,769 --> 00:04:15,150
do and that's a bit of a hacker mindset

94
00:04:12,900 --> 00:04:18,539
to to automate things so maybe next year

95
00:04:15,150 --> 00:04:20,310
I'll create my own watering system so at

96
00:04:18,539 --> 00:04:23,490
the end of the line I had three and a

97
00:04:20,310 --> 00:04:25,289
half kilos of peppers Fresno peppers

98
00:04:23,490 --> 00:04:26,610
they're from the Californian region and

99
00:04:25,289 --> 00:04:29,219
they're very easy to grow here in

100
00:04:26,610 --> 00:04:30,680
Netherlands actually so easy that I

101
00:04:29,220 --> 00:04:32,690
sometimes

102
00:04:30,680 --> 00:04:35,440
give them water or I true even some

103
00:04:32,690 --> 00:04:38,150
seeds away with some dirt and it was not

104
00:04:35,440 --> 00:04:40,430
there was no I'd like not a lot of

105
00:04:38,150 --> 00:04:42,440
sunlight there was not a lot of humidity

106
00:04:40,430 --> 00:04:45,590
but they started growing anyway so

107
00:04:42,440 --> 00:04:49,210
they're like very very easy to grow and

108
00:04:45,590 --> 00:04:52,460
they're like similar to jalapeno peppers

109
00:04:49,210 --> 00:04:56,508
but they're a bit more of a kick it's

110
00:04:52,460 --> 00:05:00,549
around 2,500 to 10,000 Scoville heat

111
00:04:56,509 --> 00:05:03,550
units so it's not it's not like there's

112
00:05:00,550 --> 00:05:05,810
tons of hot sauces out there that are

113
00:05:03,550 --> 00:05:09,080
immensely immensely hot so this hot

114
00:05:05,810 --> 00:05:11,690
sauce is not immensely hot but it's a

115
00:05:09,080 --> 00:05:14,330
bit more spicy than jalapenos so what I

116
00:05:11,690 --> 00:05:16,190
did the next process is like find a good

117
00:05:14,330 --> 00:05:18,639
recipe obviously and puts it all

118
00:05:16,190 --> 00:05:21,530
together main ingredients again peppers

119
00:05:18,639 --> 00:05:25,900
you need the good peppers and then

120
00:05:21,530 --> 00:05:29,570
vinegar salt sugar and I use some Tongan

121
00:05:25,900 --> 00:05:33,469
sonogram is basically a fermented sugar

122
00:05:29,570 --> 00:05:34,900
you can get it like in like the special

123
00:05:33,470 --> 00:05:37,760
shops where they have like the green

124
00:05:34,900 --> 00:05:39,919
stuff I'm sure how to say it in English

125
00:05:37,760 --> 00:05:41,180
but it's basically a special shop if you

126
00:05:39,919 --> 00:05:43,520
look for it you can find it everywhere

127
00:05:41,180 --> 00:05:46,159
and it basically it's a thickener for

128
00:05:43,520 --> 00:05:48,409
creating a smooth texture for your sauce

129
00:05:46,159 --> 00:05:51,530
you can use other ingredients as well

130
00:05:48,409 --> 00:05:53,330
but it's just like very easy to do and a

131
00:05:51,530 --> 00:05:54,619
pro tip is to use gloves because the

132
00:05:53,330 --> 00:06:01,250
first time I did this I didn't use

133
00:05:54,620 --> 00:06:04,400
gloves yes for days you don't get rid of

134
00:06:01,250 --> 00:06:07,520
it for days if you cut a lot of peppers

135
00:06:04,400 --> 00:06:10,008
at least and the most fun part and

136
00:06:07,520 --> 00:06:12,799
exciting part for me to learn what's the

137
00:06:10,009 --> 00:06:15,800
fermentation part so for the

138
00:06:12,800 --> 00:06:19,520
fermentation part I also use the carrots

139
00:06:15,800 --> 00:06:21,830
to tone down the heat and the carrots

140
00:06:19,520 --> 00:06:24,609
basically they were just a filler so it

141
00:06:21,830 --> 00:06:27,948
creates it creates a more orange color

142
00:06:24,610 --> 00:06:29,840
in the sauce but you can add anything

143
00:06:27,949 --> 00:06:31,460
you'd like like tiny apple whatever you

144
00:06:29,840 --> 00:06:33,289
like pineapple however like the

145
00:06:31,460 --> 00:06:36,229
disadvantage of pineapple it's a fresh

146
00:06:33,289 --> 00:06:37,880
ingredients and so you really want you

147
00:06:36,229 --> 00:06:39,560
to have freshness in there so if you

148
00:06:37,880 --> 00:06:41,620
want to keep it for a long time

149
00:06:39,560 --> 00:06:44,180
pineapple is not really a way to go

150
00:06:41,620 --> 00:06:46,550
carrots are easy and they can

151
00:06:44,180 --> 00:06:49,550
like they don't go bad for a long period

152
00:06:46,550 --> 00:06:51,530
of time but the fermentation like I took

153
00:06:49,550 --> 00:06:55,970
a week to ferment and basically what I

154
00:06:51,530 --> 00:06:57,739
did I I got this canister from our

155
00:06:55,970 --> 00:07:02,900
hacker space they also do beer brewing

156
00:06:57,740 --> 00:07:06,110
there I stole it and I put it back

157
00:07:02,900 --> 00:07:11,630
though basically plastic container you

158
00:07:06,110 --> 00:07:15,740
fill it up with water in salt and you

159
00:07:11,630 --> 00:07:18,050
put it in the peppers the the carrots

160
00:07:15,740 --> 00:07:23,120
and then you make sure you use a

161
00:07:18,050 --> 00:07:25,040
cheesecloth or I use baking paper you

162
00:07:23,120 --> 00:07:26,380
put it on top so it gets submerged

163
00:07:25,040 --> 00:07:29,450
because the important part is that

164
00:07:26,380 --> 00:07:32,900
everything keep stays submerged because

165
00:07:29,450 --> 00:07:36,349
otherwise they'll well you get the wrong

166
00:07:32,900 --> 00:07:37,940
fungi out there and you want to look at

167
00:07:36,350 --> 00:07:40,580
it daily basically to make sure there's

168
00:07:37,940 --> 00:07:43,130
no weird stuff growing on the top the

169
00:07:40,580 --> 00:07:46,820
important part is to look at it smell it

170
00:07:43,130 --> 00:07:49,219
and if it's if it doesn't look or look

171
00:07:46,820 --> 00:07:51,530
right then you need to stir up or skim

172
00:07:49,220 --> 00:07:54,770
the top basically but what my trick was

173
00:07:51,530 --> 00:07:56,840
is to fill up bags with water and then

174
00:07:54,770 --> 00:07:57,890
lay it on top because then it's just you

175
00:07:56,840 --> 00:08:01,190
don't really need to

176
00:07:57,890 --> 00:08:04,280
it will stay submerged and it's very

177
00:08:01,190 --> 00:08:05,990
easy easy thing to do so for about five

178
00:08:04,280 --> 00:08:08,840
to seven days you keep it in a canister

179
00:08:05,990 --> 00:08:10,670
and then it's properly fermented some

180
00:08:08,840 --> 00:08:13,070
people do it for a very long period of

181
00:08:10,670 --> 00:08:16,820
time you can do it as well but then you

182
00:08:13,070 --> 00:08:18,890
need like the thing on top - well you

183
00:08:16,820 --> 00:08:21,140
can the submerging part it's still also

184
00:08:18,890 --> 00:08:22,820
usable but mostly you keep and have an

185
00:08:21,140 --> 00:08:25,520
airlock or something to make it more

186
00:08:22,820 --> 00:08:29,690
easy for yourself so it's easier to do

187
00:08:25,520 --> 00:08:31,609
so basically it's it's very simple it

188
00:08:29,690 --> 00:08:33,919
doesn't require a lot and it's just a

189
00:08:31,610 --> 00:08:38,240
few ingredients but I did have some

190
00:08:33,919 --> 00:08:39,679
lessons along the way and I'll share the

191
00:08:38,240 --> 00:08:41,030
recipe with you if you really want to

192
00:08:39,679 --> 00:08:44,719
dive into it

193
00:08:41,030 --> 00:08:47,510
I'll put it online but the things I

194
00:08:44,720 --> 00:08:49,780
learned was fresh no peppers really grow

195
00:08:47,510 --> 00:08:52,970
well like I said despite the conditions

196
00:08:49,780 --> 00:08:55,069
so last summer was a very good summer so

197
00:08:52,970 --> 00:08:57,920
it was a lot of sunlight which is very

198
00:08:55,070 --> 00:09:00,139
nice so they need a lot of sunlight that

199
00:08:57,920 --> 00:09:03,439
the only downside so if you want to grow

200
00:09:00,139 --> 00:09:06,560
it use winter sowing during the winter

201
00:09:03,440 --> 00:09:08,630
months or and then if the Sun is nice

202
00:09:06,560 --> 00:09:10,010
outside then they'll grow pretty

203
00:09:08,630 --> 00:09:14,180
perfectly and so Dutch weather is

204
00:09:10,010 --> 00:09:15,949
actually really perfect to grow the

205
00:09:14,180 --> 00:09:18,439
hardware well if you want to try that

206
00:09:15,949 --> 00:09:22,819
it's also open source I'll show it share

207
00:09:18,440 --> 00:09:27,050
the link later but if you use well your

208
00:09:22,820 --> 00:09:28,459
soil has like acid in there and so it

209
00:09:27,050 --> 00:09:31,250
eats your hardware so if you use the

210
00:09:28,459 --> 00:09:34,160
cheap temperature sensors or the things

211
00:09:31,250 --> 00:09:36,199
you put in your plant pots they they can

212
00:09:34,160 --> 00:09:37,969
last for probably a couple of weeks but

213
00:09:36,199 --> 00:09:41,359
if you well if you want to grow peppers

214
00:09:37,970 --> 00:09:45,350
from seeds to a full plant it will take

215
00:09:41,360 --> 00:09:46,730
well a couple of months so though it

216
00:09:45,350 --> 00:09:48,290
sounds interesting to bias like a

217
00:09:46,730 --> 00:09:51,829
standard thing out of the box from a

218
00:09:48,290 --> 00:09:55,310
data fruits or something but I use the

219
00:09:51,829 --> 00:09:57,529
mesh code it's a temperature sensor for

220
00:09:55,310 --> 00:10:00,079
in the grounds for any humidity sensor

221
00:09:57,529 --> 00:10:02,720
but during like a week of powder outage

222
00:10:00,079 --> 00:10:06,319
on my balcony like the whole thing was

223
00:10:02,720 --> 00:10:10,040
like gone basically so it's uh it eats

224
00:10:06,320 --> 00:10:11,420
your hardware and then what I also

225
00:10:10,040 --> 00:10:13,550
didn't think about it like the sensor

226
00:10:11,420 --> 00:10:15,740
box I put it in the grounds on my

227
00:10:13,550 --> 00:10:18,979
balcony and then the plant started to

228
00:10:15,740 --> 00:10:21,560
grow up so it's cool that you have a

229
00:10:18,980 --> 00:10:22,940
light sensor in there but it doesn't

230
00:10:21,560 --> 00:10:27,920
work after a certain period of time

231
00:10:22,940 --> 00:10:29,449
anymore so I hope next year I can like

232
00:10:27,920 --> 00:10:31,459
do a watering system you know and

233
00:10:29,449 --> 00:10:33,260
automate all that stuff but that's not

234
00:10:31,459 --> 00:10:37,040
important stuff the fourth part is

235
00:10:33,260 --> 00:10:39,350
obviously the the thing itself and so I

236
00:10:37,040 --> 00:10:41,630
have these bottles here it's called

237
00:10:39,350 --> 00:10:43,010
Simon's hot zones by the way and the

238
00:10:41,630 --> 00:10:45,170
reason why I call it Simon's hot sauce

239
00:10:43,010 --> 00:10:47,149
is because I had a cat named Simon and

240
00:10:45,170 --> 00:10:48,560
so this is basically a tribute to him

241
00:10:47,149 --> 00:10:52,160
but there are other cuts the cats the

242
00:10:48,560 --> 00:10:55,790
hey call call Simon well Simon's cat's

243
00:10:52,160 --> 00:10:58,130
not really called Simon here but there's

244
00:10:55,790 --> 00:11:03,709
also Simon the cat and that's an old

245
00:10:58,130 --> 00:11:05,750
story on a Navy SEAL ship and he was

246
00:11:03,709 --> 00:11:07,640
basically the mascot because because he

247
00:11:05,750 --> 00:11:11,209
ate all the rest on a ship so he's like

248
00:11:07,640 --> 00:11:11,840
a famous hero on a ship so I named it

249
00:11:11,209 --> 00:11:14,689
after

250
00:11:11,840 --> 00:11:17,780
after those cats and did some artwork

251
00:11:14,690 --> 00:11:19,100
artwork of my own so there's the logo on

252
00:11:17,780 --> 00:11:22,100
there also very importance

253
00:11:19,100 --> 00:11:25,400
it looks nice the bottle is nice and I

254
00:11:22,100 --> 00:11:28,700
sold them for like eight zero each and I

255
00:11:25,400 --> 00:11:31,310
made around I think like sixty or

256
00:11:28,700 --> 00:11:34,940
seventy bottles from three and a half

257
00:11:31,310 --> 00:11:40,219
kilos of peppers so that's quite a lot

258
00:11:34,940 --> 00:11:42,370
actually and the bottling process is

259
00:11:40,220 --> 00:11:45,170
also something to be careful at because

260
00:11:42,370 --> 00:11:48,070
what you want to do is you want to boil

261
00:11:45,170 --> 00:11:50,990
the bottles up front because otherwise

262
00:11:48,070 --> 00:11:53,930
well-well you get again the wrong fungi

263
00:11:50,990 --> 00:11:54,620
in here so to preserve it you want to

264
00:11:53,930 --> 00:11:56,839
boil it

265
00:11:54,620 --> 00:11:59,870
but with these bottles I bought them at

266
00:11:56,840 --> 00:12:04,550
Brown worth a Dutch supplier of lots of

267
00:11:59,870 --> 00:12:07,490
ferment that projects stuff well i

268
00:12:04,550 --> 00:12:11,359
boiled the caps as well but the plastic

269
00:12:07,490 --> 00:12:12,620
is well it's plastic yes so it's it's I

270
00:12:11,360 --> 00:12:14,450
still need to figure out that part out

271
00:12:12,620 --> 00:12:16,490
so you want to blow the bottle so you

272
00:12:14,450 --> 00:12:19,160
can you close it properly so you can

273
00:12:16,490 --> 00:12:21,740
keep it for like a long period time time

274
00:12:19,160 --> 00:12:25,130
probably a year or longer and these are

275
00:12:21,740 --> 00:12:28,910
probably now five months four months old

276
00:12:25,130 --> 00:12:31,640
maybe but yeah these sort of things and

277
00:12:28,910 --> 00:12:34,250
what I'm also gonna do is because I was

278
00:12:31,640 --> 00:12:35,960
like so obsessed by these cats now and I

279
00:12:34,250 --> 00:12:38,210
know it's quite random

280
00:12:35,960 --> 00:12:39,710
I started decided to donate half the

281
00:12:38,210 --> 00:12:42,670
money to get found ages here in the

282
00:12:39,710 --> 00:12:45,410
Netherlands because I sold them all

283
00:12:42,670 --> 00:12:46,790
pretty quickly I still have a few left

284
00:12:45,410 --> 00:12:48,829
because I talked with the me Trina

285
00:12:46,790 --> 00:12:51,790
something you need to explain it more so

286
00:12:48,830 --> 00:12:54,320
I kept a few for this talk so we'll

287
00:12:51,790 --> 00:12:58,130
we'll have a tasting session because

288
00:12:54,320 --> 00:13:01,160
that's the most important part but

289
00:12:58,130 --> 00:13:05,810
before I do I keep experimenting with

290
00:13:01,160 --> 00:13:08,750
food and so at our hackerspace is also

291
00:13:05,810 --> 00:13:10,219
quite random we had a thing they called

292
00:13:08,750 --> 00:13:12,050
a disappointment box which was basically

293
00:13:10,220 --> 00:13:13,610
if you know kinder super diva

294
00:13:12,050 --> 00:13:16,219
they have like piece of plastic in there

295
00:13:13,610 --> 00:13:17,900
that you can put together and so I was

296
00:13:16,220 --> 00:13:20,060
thinking like okay what can we do with

297
00:13:17,900 --> 00:13:23,840
chocolate I want to do something with

298
00:13:20,060 --> 00:13:25,640
chocolate as well so this is like a big

299
00:13:23,840 --> 00:13:31,010
big surprise for you guys

300
00:13:25,640 --> 00:13:33,860
I have a hacker surprise for you all

301
00:13:31,010 --> 00:13:36,530
which is basically well we did it

302
00:13:33,860 --> 00:13:38,690
together at pixel bar ik indicia pretty

303
00:13:36,530 --> 00:13:40,939
Zack made of chocolate similar to your

304
00:13:38,690 --> 00:13:43,400
kidneys pleased with a different

305
00:13:40,940 --> 00:13:48,050
surprise inside so I'll hand it out as

306
00:13:43,400 --> 00:13:51,709
well and that's actually my talk so

307
00:13:48,050 --> 00:13:54,459
we'll go over to the tasting session so

308
00:13:51,710 --> 00:13:57,230
do you guys want to taste them or yes

309
00:13:54,460 --> 00:13:59,660
perfect perfect then I'll hand some

310
00:13:57,230 --> 00:14:06,880
islets and if there are questions

311
00:13:59,660 --> 00:14:06,880
actually you can ask them right now yes

312
00:14:06,910 --> 00:14:12,260
so the question is it can you use

313
00:14:08,900 --> 00:14:15,829
cucumber well I think you can throw in

314
00:14:12,260 --> 00:14:20,780
anything you want but I think cucumber

315
00:14:15,830 --> 00:14:24,470
is a bit too watery and tasteless maybe

316
00:14:20,780 --> 00:14:27,130
even but obviously you can try like you

317
00:14:24,470 --> 00:14:30,290
can you can throw anything if you want

318
00:14:27,130 --> 00:14:33,680
but I think the most important part is

319
00:14:30,290 --> 00:14:35,329
also to look for a texture so if you use

320
00:14:33,680 --> 00:14:38,569
pineapple you get a very very different

321
00:14:35,330 --> 00:14:42,320
texture and carrots if you blend that up

322
00:14:38,570 --> 00:14:44,440
well with the peppers you get like now

323
00:14:42,320 --> 00:14:55,790
I'll show you it's a very smooth smooth

324
00:14:44,440 --> 00:14:59,240
texture there we go if you can see it

325
00:14:55,790 --> 00:15:01,189
like it's a very nice smooth texture and

326
00:14:59,240 --> 00:15:03,230
it's actually a bit sour so what the

327
00:15:01,190 --> 00:15:05,840
fermentation process does is actually it

328
00:15:03,230 --> 00:15:08,890
creates more sourness to it more than

329
00:15:05,840 --> 00:15:13,340
that depth what most people refer it to

330
00:15:08,890 --> 00:15:15,590
and I smells it smells pretty strong and

331
00:15:13,340 --> 00:15:17,720
it also it's there's apple vinegar in

332
00:15:15,590 --> 00:15:20,120
there so you can use like fruits are

333
00:15:17,720 --> 00:15:22,940
very good to do actually so I used apple

334
00:15:20,120 --> 00:15:25,310
vinegar so it's a bit more sour and the

335
00:15:22,940 --> 00:15:27,170
vinegar preserves as well so it's also

336
00:15:25,310 --> 00:15:30,229
preserver which is really good tip to

337
00:15:27,170 --> 00:15:31,300
use but let's stay some that's the thing

338
00:15:30,230 --> 00:15:34,870
that's

339
00:15:31,300 --> 00:15:37,180
I brought some chicken well they made it

340
00:15:34,870 --> 00:15:39,940
here in the kitchen I didn't have any

341
00:15:37,180 --> 00:15:46,689
Forks and things but I'll just hand them

342
00:15:39,940 --> 00:15:47,700
a few arounds oops maybe you can pass it

343
00:15:46,690 --> 00:15:54,690
along

344
00:15:47,700 --> 00:15:54,690

346
00:15:57,370 --> 00:16:01,120

if you want a bottle it's eight zeros

369

foundation and tell me what you think

371
00:17:30,460 --> 00:17:34,210
about the sauce so for my next project

372
00:17:32,290 --> 00:17:36,879
for the next iteration I'll improve it

373
00:17:34,210 --> 00:17:40,780
it's good it's not too spicy right it's

374
00:17:36,880 --> 00:17:46,580
just it's just good enough perfect

375
00:17:40,780 --> 00:17:51,520
awesome and a chocolate it's hard to do

376
00:17:46,580 --> 00:17:55,550
actually it's that's why it's a

377
00:17:51,520 --> 00:17:58,520
profession on its own and hope next time

378
