9
00:00:30,570 --> 00:00:34,050
speaker by slide what you need to know

10
00:00:33,270 --> 00:00:36,360
about me

11
00:00:34,050 --> 00:00:38,849
yeah I'm half Latvian so hence

12
00:00:36,360 --> 00:00:39,990
interested in Latvia and so forth and

13
00:00:38,850 --> 00:00:41,670
actually the reason reason for the

14
00:00:39,990 --> 00:00:44,270
unicorn here as well on the slide is

15
00:00:41,670 --> 00:00:47,460
because when I was growing up in England

16
00:00:44,270 --> 00:00:50,100
the Soviet the Iron Curtain was still in

17
00:00:47,460 --> 00:00:53,190
full effect and Latvia and places like

18
00:00:50,100 --> 00:00:55,230
that were seen as being sort of

19
00:00:53,190 --> 00:00:56,820
forbidden and anywhere that's and

20
00:00:55,230 --> 00:00:58,379
forbidden is therefore of interest here

21
00:00:56,820 --> 00:01:00,360
out of communism and everyone being

22
00:00:58,380 --> 00:01:01,680
equal and all these wonderful things it

23
00:01:00,360 --> 00:01:03,810
was like sort of magical fairy land you

24
00:01:01,680 --> 00:01:06,420
can never visit and so in your head you

25
00:01:03,810 --> 00:01:08,070
have that view so I was you know and

26
00:01:06,420 --> 00:01:10,409
perhaps I was a staunch coyness until I

27
00:01:08,070 --> 00:01:12,329
was about 10 and then you discover that

28
00:01:10,409 --> 00:01:14,159
the system isn't quite as good as it's

29
00:01:12,329 --> 00:01:19,109
meant to be and everything collapsed and

30
00:01:14,159 --> 00:01:22,710
anyway so yeah and yeah so on the on the

31
00:01:19,109 --> 00:01:23,520
MTB I know MBTI indicator I come ass

32
00:01:22,710 --> 00:01:25,859
being an INFP

33
00:01:23,520 --> 00:01:27,149
if you don't that's the myers-briggs

34
00:01:25,859 --> 00:01:28,979
Type Indicator switched personalities

35
00:01:27,149 --> 00:01:30,929
and things and if you don't know about

36
00:01:28,979 --> 00:01:33,749
that Google there's a website 16

37
00:01:30,929 --> 00:01:36,200
personalities calm and you can find out

38
00:01:33,749 --> 00:01:39,869
what your own personality is and you

39
00:01:36,200 --> 00:01:41,880
sort of so I'm more an introvert and so

40
00:01:39,869 --> 00:01:43,229
it's public speaking is not not

41
00:01:41,880 --> 00:01:45,060
something I enjoy but it's a good

42
00:01:43,229 --> 00:01:47,939
challenge and I just get better at it

43
00:01:45,060 --> 00:01:49,289
so hence I'm here and but yeah have a

44
00:01:47,939 --> 00:01:51,089
look at that and actually find out more

45
00:01:49,289 --> 00:01:52,649
about yourself and sort of things

46
00:01:51,090 --> 00:01:54,659
resonates and we're all different so

47
00:01:52,649 --> 00:01:58,319
good to understand yourself but I like

48
00:01:54,659 --> 00:02:00,539
ideas at all that so yeah it's a couple

49
00:01:58,319 --> 00:02:04,439
of years ago or three years ago now I

50
00:02:00,539 --> 00:02:07,049
was I was 40 and so actually I guess

51
00:02:04,439 --> 00:02:09,030
what what are the demographics of

52
00:02:07,049 --> 00:02:12,319
everyone here who's who's over 40 for

53
00:02:09,030 --> 00:02:15,780
example so okay so about two-thirds and

54
00:02:12,319 --> 00:02:16,980
so to pursue will recognize everything

55
00:02:15,780 --> 00:02:18,000
I'm going to talk about and the other

56
00:02:16,980 --> 00:02:21,119
third will have the

57
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:24,780
to come so prepare yourself say anyway

58
00:02:21,120 --> 00:02:28,920
when I was 40 I absolutely did not have

59
00:02:24,780 --> 00:02:31,560
a midlife crisis definitely not but I

60
00:02:28,920 --> 00:02:33,119
did spy Spitfire that was very fun and I

61
00:02:31,560 --> 00:02:35,130
did hurtle down the crest to run and

62
00:02:33,120 --> 00:02:37,380
sort of came off and did that at several

63
00:02:35,130 --> 00:02:40,140
rates and stuff and I slightly

64
00:02:37,380 --> 00:02:42,990
accidentally became the proud custodian

65
00:02:40,140 --> 00:02:47,220
of a fine Latvian water tower and this

66
00:02:42,990 --> 00:02:50,100
is the story of that bit so yeah anyway

67
00:02:47,220 --> 00:02:51,470
your Latvia so I don't know about the

68
00:02:50,100 --> 00:02:54,269
Dutch and what you think of Latvia but

69
00:02:51,470 --> 00:02:56,490
the picture a lot of people in the UK

70
00:02:54,270 --> 00:02:58,800
have is I said it used to be like this

71
00:02:56,490 --> 00:03:00,510
is somewhere you go on stag dues and

72
00:02:58,800 --> 00:03:02,610
have raucous parties and there's the

73
00:03:00,510 --> 00:03:03,810
beer bus here that people ride around to

74
00:03:02,610 --> 00:03:06,450
get drunk I imagine do you have those

75
00:03:03,810 --> 00:03:12,060
Amsterdam yeah okay so it's like staying

76
00:03:06,450 --> 00:03:12,750
at home so it's just like Amsterdam okay

77
00:03:12,060 --> 00:03:15,630
that's good to know

78
00:03:12,750 --> 00:03:17,940
so cool and yeah and yeah a little stag

79
00:03:15,630 --> 00:03:19,920
dues you got shooting shooting rifles

80
00:03:17,940 --> 00:03:22,290
and ak-47s and all that good stuff that

81
00:03:19,920 --> 00:03:24,390
you can do down there and parties and

82
00:03:22,290 --> 00:03:28,109
lasers they are so actually like here is

83
00:03:24,390 --> 00:03:29,809
right just like like Holland but

84
00:03:28,110 --> 00:03:32,430
actually you know part of the parties

85
00:03:29,810 --> 00:03:34,410
the side of Latvia that people don't see

86
00:03:32,430 --> 00:03:35,940
commonly but going over there that sort

87
00:03:34,410 --> 00:03:38,220
of makes me cringe and want to apologize

88
00:03:35,940 --> 00:03:40,920
every time I write is the deeper the

89
00:03:38,220 --> 00:03:43,650
quieter side of the country and and

90
00:03:40,920 --> 00:03:45,268
actually yeah if you're if you're so

91
00:03:43,650 --> 00:03:47,130
introvert or whatever it's it's a great

92
00:03:45,269 --> 00:03:48,600
place to be and actually where else

93
00:03:47,130 --> 00:03:51,540
could you get a bus to literally a place

94
00:03:48,600 --> 00:03:54,600
called solitude so that is a suburb of

95
00:03:51,540 --> 00:03:56,429
Latvia and initially the whole introvert

96
00:03:54,600 --> 00:03:58,799
thing is is quite Latvian as well so

97
00:03:56,430 --> 00:04:00,420
last year they had the lap in the or the

98
00:03:58,799 --> 00:04:02,280
the Book Fair the London Book Fair and

99
00:04:00,420 --> 00:04:04,260
like we had this whole theme of I'm

100
00:04:02,280 --> 00:04:05,820
introvert which was a subtracting

101
00:04:04,260 --> 00:04:08,820
hashtag and they have these cartoons

102
00:04:05,820 --> 00:04:11,280
done for it and there's one that one of

103
00:04:08,820 --> 00:04:12,390
the cartoons and I Verizon I adenosine

104
00:04:11,280 --> 00:04:13,590
to make sense maybe cuz people to ask

105
00:04:12,390 --> 00:04:15,000
you things then you so think about

106
00:04:13,590 --> 00:04:16,228
things and over think about things and

107
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:17,488
think about that again and then

108
00:04:16,228 --> 00:04:19,858
eventually I might get an answer but I

109
00:04:17,488 --> 00:04:21,179
wish I'd literally gone so one of my

110
00:04:19,858 --> 00:04:23,039
resolutions this year has been to

111
00:04:21,180 --> 00:04:24,870
communicate better and and I should have

112
00:04:23,040 --> 00:04:26,310
learned I tend to be trying a bit of a

113
00:04:24,870 --> 00:04:28,110
perfectionist about stuff and then you

114
00:04:26,310 --> 00:04:30,300
never deliver anything so it's better to

115
00:04:28,110 --> 00:04:32,070
get you know something out and 90% of

116
00:04:30,300 --> 00:04:33,720
the message and not perfect and

117
00:04:32,070 --> 00:04:36,990
yeah something I heard the other day was

118
00:04:33,720 --> 00:04:38,940
a an idiot that takes action is going to

119
00:04:36,990 --> 00:04:40,890
be more successful than someone who's

120
00:04:38,940 --> 00:04:42,660
you know perfectionist and never does

121
00:04:40,890 --> 00:04:44,250
anything and that's very true but it's

122
00:04:42,660 --> 00:04:47,010
very hard to go against your nature but

123
00:04:44,250 --> 00:04:48,240
it's something you have to do so yeah

124
00:04:47,010 --> 00:04:49,469
are they they did these cartoons

125
00:04:48,240 --> 00:04:53,070
actually interestingly this book of

126
00:04:49,470 --> 00:04:54,870
cartoons for hashtag I'm introvert you

127
00:04:53,070 --> 00:04:56,520
can't buy them online so you've actually

128
00:04:54,870 --> 00:04:58,290
got to go to a particular book shop to

129
00:04:56,520 --> 00:05:02,039
buy them or get an extroverted friend to

130
00:04:58,290 --> 00:05:04,140
go for you and so yeah they got a few

131
00:05:02,040 --> 00:05:08,130
rings wrong label that but actually yeah

132
00:05:04,140 --> 00:05:11,550
so mm few things crazy Dutch hackers

133
00:05:08,130 --> 00:05:14,580
versus laughs here in yeah so hack space

134
00:05:11,550 --> 00:05:16,740
we have rule 0 don't be on fire Latvians

135
00:05:14,580 --> 00:05:18,960
love to challenge that and so there's a

136
00:05:16,740 --> 00:05:22,200
national tradition of jumping over fires

137
00:05:18,960 --> 00:05:25,830
in you know sort of some of Midsummer's

138
00:05:22,200 --> 00:05:27,030
and so forth a Yanni festival and yeah

139
00:05:25,830 --> 00:05:30,560
don't get blown to death it's probably

140
00:05:27,030 --> 00:05:34,109
the rule over there or get voted F once

141
00:05:30,560 --> 00:05:36,870
so yeah that's a good thing and again

142
00:05:34,110 --> 00:05:39,630
beer is big thing over there the Latvian

143
00:05:36,870 --> 00:05:40,860
beer is very very very very good indeed

144
00:05:39,630 --> 00:05:43,320
money back you don't like it and

145
00:05:40,860 --> 00:05:44,970
actually some little bit of that V and

146
00:05:43,320 --> 00:05:47,490
if you say look so diverse Alice that's

147
00:05:44,970 --> 00:05:48,660
please two beers and for a long time

148
00:05:47,490 --> 00:05:49,980
that was about all I could say in laughs

149
00:05:48,660 --> 00:05:53,340
you know I've been learning a little bit

150
00:05:49,980 --> 00:05:56,700
that take takes a while so yeah there's

151
00:05:53,340 --> 00:05:58,560
good things though and actually yeah so

152
00:05:56,700 --> 00:06:01,349
Latvia as well if you're into technology

153
00:05:58,560 --> 00:06:03,150
and stuff so from the claims to fame for

154
00:06:01,350 --> 00:06:05,340
the country and I'd like to prove it is

155
00:06:03,150 --> 00:06:08,760
they have have all had the fastest

156
00:06:05,340 --> 00:06:10,140
internet in the world and yeah quite how

157
00:06:08,760 --> 00:06:12,630
this starts coming up with I'm not sure

158
00:06:10,140 --> 00:06:14,430
that everyone's got 5 or nowadays I see

159
00:06:12,630 --> 00:06:16,830
on the other sides of the same markers

160
00:06:14,430 --> 00:06:18,930
they're saying the most most popular

161
00:06:16,830 --> 00:06:21,120
product in Latvia is the potato so I

162
00:06:18,930 --> 00:06:23,070
wonder who was doing a survey there of

163
00:06:21,120 --> 00:06:28,860
what's your favorite product was it got

164
00:06:23,070 --> 00:06:30,719
to be the potato this so you know it's a

165
00:06:28,860 --> 00:06:34,230
great place to go and a unicorn again is

166
00:06:30,720 --> 00:06:35,610
actually technology in the Baltics is

167
00:06:34,230 --> 00:06:38,850
very strong and actually compared to

168
00:06:35,610 --> 00:06:41,430
Silicon Valley Estonia so just just the

169
00:06:38,850 --> 00:06:43,080
north they have more unicorns per head

170
00:06:41,430 --> 00:06:45,150
of population as in you know company

171
00:06:43,080 --> 00:06:46,560
valued at over a billion dollars

172
00:06:45,150 --> 00:06:48,659
than anywhere else in the world so

173
00:06:46,560 --> 00:06:53,070
including Silicon Valley so other states

174
00:06:48,660 --> 00:06:54,780
so yeah and again yeah Latvia versus

175
00:06:53,070 --> 00:06:56,460
versus here I think if you're into radio

176
00:06:54,780 --> 00:06:57,869
you get you've got maximum 400 watts

177
00:06:56,460 --> 00:06:59,669
here I know that's the case in England

178
00:06:57,870 --> 00:07:02,100
whereas over there you can transmit the

179
00:06:59,669 --> 00:07:06,109
kilowatt and sort of go to go to town

180
00:07:02,100 --> 00:07:10,020
tops the world so but yeah so yeah cool

181
00:07:06,110 --> 00:07:13,260
but actually yeah with properties and

182
00:07:10,020 --> 00:07:14,400
stuff I mean England is top of property

183
00:07:13,260 --> 00:07:15,930
bubble that's probably all about to fall

184
00:07:14,400 --> 00:07:18,060
apart and about time too

185
00:07:15,930 --> 00:07:22,020
and I'm guessing living here is not too

186
00:07:18,060 --> 00:07:23,070
cheap Ivers it but or no worries so and

187
00:07:22,020 --> 00:07:26,849
certainly you hear about people living

188
00:07:23,070 --> 00:07:28,650
again in Silicon Valley in trucks and

189
00:07:26,850 --> 00:07:29,550
you know caravans and sleeping their

190
00:07:28,650 --> 00:07:32,760
cars because nobody could afford

191
00:07:29,550 --> 00:07:34,290
anywhere to live so yeah and I had a

192
00:07:32,760 --> 00:07:35,520
look out of interested to see what so

193
00:07:34,290 --> 00:07:37,950
eighty five thousand pounds that's like

194
00:07:35,520 --> 00:07:40,590
a hundred thousand euros will will for

195
00:07:37,950 --> 00:07:43,979
example by this very fine single garage

196
00:07:40,590 --> 00:07:46,619
in sort of outside London even in some

197
00:07:43,979 --> 00:07:48,680
twickum west of London so that's that's

198
00:07:46,620 --> 00:07:51,180
what that's the value you get in the UK

199
00:07:48,680 --> 00:07:53,570
so you know the affordable house is

200
00:07:51,180 --> 00:07:58,289
generally affordable if you're a shake

201
00:07:53,570 --> 00:08:01,710
whereas actually yeah sometimes bloody

202
00:07:58,289 --> 00:08:04,050
mouth Latvian and work very hard and run

203
00:08:01,710 --> 00:08:05,310
the IT company and the grass always

204
00:08:04,050 --> 00:08:08,490
greener and whatever you do that's a

205
00:08:05,310 --> 00:08:11,789
fact of life and I I really like the

206
00:08:08,490 --> 00:08:15,690
fact that it's like so 150 years ago if

207
00:08:11,789 --> 00:08:17,760
you lived in the Baltics or it was all a

208
00:08:15,690 --> 00:08:19,050
bit backward compared to now and you

209
00:08:17,760 --> 00:08:21,960
know so much to change people didn't

210
00:08:19,050 --> 00:08:23,280
even have surnames 150 years ago but

211
00:08:21,960 --> 00:08:25,919
everything in your life would have come

212
00:08:23,280 --> 00:08:27,479
from within about 20 kilometres so the

213
00:08:25,919 --> 00:08:30,450
you know the wood that your house is

214
00:08:27,479 --> 00:08:33,539
made of the the horse you ride the self

215
00:08:30,450 --> 00:08:36,539
a horse wife you marry everything so

216
00:08:33,539 --> 00:08:37,949
it's all very very sustainable they

217
00:08:36,539 --> 00:08:39,958
didn't have dentistry and modern things

218
00:08:37,950 --> 00:08:44,219
that we do enjoy that I wouldn't want to

219
00:08:39,958 --> 00:08:45,540
give up but I sometimes hanker after you

220
00:08:44,219 --> 00:08:47,070
know stead of being a keyboard just sort

221
00:08:45,540 --> 00:08:51,420
of living off the land and living this

222
00:08:47,070 --> 00:08:54,720
sustainable good life and yeah there's

223
00:08:51,420 --> 00:08:57,300
website in Latvia SS calm and so it's

224
00:08:54,720 --> 00:08:58,610
not the Nazi SS that is basically

225
00:08:57,300 --> 00:09:00,469
translates to a small

226
00:08:58,610 --> 00:09:03,350
so it's the equipt of either or

227
00:09:00,470 --> 00:09:06,649
Craigslist or something and this this

228
00:09:03,350 --> 00:09:08,779
website is particularly addictive so

229
00:09:06,649 --> 00:09:10,670
they list have listings for everything

230
00:09:08,779 --> 00:09:12,740
and sometimes I sit at my desk and think

231
00:09:10,670 --> 00:09:14,149
oh let's have a look and see what there

232
00:09:12,740 --> 00:09:16,160
is and you know could you sort of

233
00:09:14,149 --> 00:09:19,310
daydream for minute about getting a farm

234
00:09:16,160 --> 00:09:22,250
over there or something and yeah so as

235
00:09:19,310 --> 00:09:23,839
you can see this is all in Latvian but

236
00:09:22,250 --> 00:09:26,290
you've got some features that tell you

237
00:09:23,839 --> 00:09:29,089
about what things are and you can then

238
00:09:26,290 --> 00:09:31,610
use Google Translate and it turns it

239
00:09:29,089 --> 00:09:33,290
into English so it's a machine

240
00:09:31,610 --> 00:09:34,670
translation but it's actually pretty

241
00:09:33,290 --> 00:09:35,959
good and you can browse through so

242
00:09:34,670 --> 00:09:37,459
actually have a look at the website and

243
00:09:35,959 --> 00:09:40,670
it's quite down a rabbit hole

244
00:09:37,459 --> 00:09:42,109
so yeah sometimes I used to do

245
00:09:40,670 --> 00:09:43,969
occasionally sit my desk have a look and

246
00:09:42,110 --> 00:09:46,279
yeah sort of see what properties are

247
00:09:43,970 --> 00:09:47,779
around and yeah Houston sort of go into

248
00:09:46,279 --> 00:09:51,350
there so whereas we've got the English

249
00:09:47,779 --> 00:09:52,070
property so yeah you can go into the

250
00:09:51,350 --> 00:09:55,269
property section

251
00:09:52,070 --> 00:09:57,380
oh here's here here's a good one with

252
00:09:55,269 --> 00:10:00,740
yeah this is machine translation so

253
00:09:57,380 --> 00:10:03,410
she'd this one here Realtors Park Oh

254
00:10:00,740 --> 00:10:04,970
Liam laughing pliancy Ashton's rubbish

255
00:10:03,410 --> 00:10:07,490
this one I thought was quite good when

256
00:10:04,970 --> 00:10:10,250
you translate that it becomes literally

257
00:10:07,490 --> 00:10:12,980
thieves services so who says machine

258
00:10:10,250 --> 00:10:15,740
translations no good that's that's

259
00:10:12,980 --> 00:10:18,050
Freudian ly good yeah that sir so anyway

260
00:10:15,740 --> 00:10:20,060
um but I I was browsing one day and I I

261
00:10:18,050 --> 00:10:22,490
came across the auction section and

262
00:10:20,060 --> 00:10:23,989
everyone likes a bargain don't they so I

263
00:10:22,490 --> 00:10:27,829
thought oh I'll have a look and see what

264
00:10:23,990 --> 00:10:31,550
there is and and I and and actually

265
00:10:27,829 --> 00:10:33,349
generally hidden in that via property is

266
00:10:31,550 --> 00:10:35,599
pretty reasonable so see this this was

267
00:10:33,350 --> 00:10:37,490
one I found as well just an example of

268
00:10:35,600 --> 00:10:39,260
value so eighty-five thousand or hundred

269
00:10:37,490 --> 00:10:42,380
thousand euros gets you the single

270
00:10:39,260 --> 00:10:47,839
garage in London or outside London and

271
00:10:42,380 --> 00:10:49,910
this property was basically it is 18 a

272
00:10:47,839 --> 00:10:52,760
block of 18 apartments with a hectare of

273
00:10:49,910 --> 00:10:54,319
land in the looks neigh which is a

274
00:10:52,760 --> 00:10:55,730
really nice area and the whole thing you

275
00:10:54,320 --> 00:10:59,390
can buy the whole 18 for ten thousand

276
00:10:55,730 --> 00:11:03,560
euros so you know that's that's what 500

277
00:10:59,390 --> 00:11:05,860
euros each and you know you can't go

278
00:11:03,560 --> 00:11:08,170
wrong at that can you so

279
00:11:05,860 --> 00:11:09,970
I mean but then what would you do with

280
00:11:08,170 --> 00:11:13,030
it that they're getting you couldn't go

281
00:11:09,970 --> 00:11:14,410
wrong so yeah okay so it's almost

282
00:11:13,030 --> 00:11:18,520
illegal not to buy stuff like that and

283
00:11:14,410 --> 00:11:21,040
anyway so yeah so I like to have a look

284
00:11:18,520 --> 00:11:25,390
and see what there is and I came across

285
00:11:21,040 --> 00:11:28,689
a listing for this fine water tower

286
00:11:25,390 --> 00:11:32,650
which is in the in the seaside area of

287
00:11:28,690 --> 00:11:35,140
Latvia and and the the auction was to

288
00:11:32,650 --> 00:11:37,930
actually be on the 20 of May and that's

289
00:11:35,140 --> 00:11:38,500
the day of my birthday so I thought oh

290
00:11:37,930 --> 00:11:40,449
okay

291
00:11:38,500 --> 00:11:41,590
what should I jump my birthday I'll go

292
00:11:40,450 --> 00:11:43,720
to Latvia for the day you can do that

293
00:11:41,590 --> 00:11:47,110
you early start laid-back but you can do

294
00:11:43,720 --> 00:11:50,380
it for the day and seemed an interesting

295
00:11:47,110 --> 00:11:51,760
property but also I thought to learn

296
00:11:50,380 --> 00:11:53,380
about the auction system and we've all

297
00:11:51,760 --> 00:11:54,760
got carried away on eBay and bought a

298
00:11:53,380 --> 00:11:56,950
few things for a bit too much do you

299
00:11:54,760 --> 00:11:59,380
think how do I pay that but it's all

300
00:11:56,950 --> 00:12:04,060
good fun so here I thought ok I'm going

301
00:11:59,380 --> 00:12:05,890
to be strategic and you know I'll learn

302
00:12:04,060 --> 00:12:07,959
about the property process so here's

303
00:12:05,890 --> 00:12:10,960
something that interesting

304
00:12:07,960 --> 00:12:13,630
interesting water tower up with a very

305
00:12:10,960 --> 00:12:17,080
rundown shed at the bottom but there's

306
00:12:13,630 --> 00:12:18,700
no way I'd get that because telephone

307
00:12:17,080 --> 00:12:20,230
companies got to buy it put master the

308
00:12:18,700 --> 00:12:21,370
top they'll pay a hundred thousand euros

309
00:12:20,230 --> 00:12:25,950
or something they've got deep pockets I

310
00:12:21,370 --> 00:12:29,500
haven't so actually zero risk of

311
00:12:25,950 --> 00:12:31,210
bankruptcy myself auction fever and you

312
00:12:29,500 --> 00:12:34,000
know how would a hold an auction work

313
00:12:31,210 --> 00:12:36,520
abroad so it's like you know you see

314
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:37,840
Japanese car auctions and you know would

315
00:12:36,520 --> 00:12:40,630
you understand the language if you don't

316
00:12:37,840 --> 00:12:41,650
speak it and as she is a tricky language

317
00:12:40,630 --> 00:12:43,270
to learn laughing mainly because

318
00:12:41,650 --> 00:12:44,230
everyone speaks such good English as

319
00:12:43,270 --> 00:12:45,790
their like you're probably learning

320
00:12:44,230 --> 00:12:47,560
Dutch is similar in that everyone you

321
00:12:45,790 --> 00:12:52,689
all speak brilliant English so my Dutch

322
00:12:47,560 --> 00:12:55,089
is nil so yes it was on David David

323
00:12:52,690 --> 00:12:56,890
birthdays I've registered for it and I

324
00:12:55,090 --> 00:12:58,870
thought yet to learn about it so wins I

325
00:12:56,890 --> 00:13:02,230
mean I did want came up I know the

326
00:12:58,870 --> 00:13:04,900
process and be a bit briefed so yeah so

327
00:13:02,230 --> 00:13:07,090
I did that and actually yeah bit more

328
00:13:04,900 --> 00:13:08,439
detailed it so this particular thing

329
00:13:07,090 --> 00:13:11,110
they give you the particulars and it's

330
00:13:08,440 --> 00:13:14,350
it's got 510 square meters of land and

331
00:13:11,110 --> 00:13:16,420
the tower is 40 meters high and various

332
00:13:14,350 --> 00:13:18,090
other details and 40 cubic meters of

333
00:13:16,420 --> 00:13:19,800
water it will hold

334
00:13:18,090 --> 00:13:23,010
does hold and not in a very good

335
00:13:19,800 --> 00:13:25,740
technical condition so anyway yes I've

336
00:13:23,010 --> 00:13:27,990
registered for it Phil did the forms

337
00:13:25,740 --> 00:13:31,500
translated them and sort of sent deposit

338
00:13:27,990 --> 00:13:35,250
off and stuff like that and and that was

339
00:13:31,500 --> 00:13:37,890
a couple of months before so so I was

340
00:13:35,250 --> 00:13:39,390
waiting Google did amount of interest

341
00:13:37,890 --> 00:13:41,220
actually I'm I'm no good some people

342
00:13:39,390 --> 00:13:43,230
architects and designers they could look

343
00:13:41,220 --> 00:13:44,910
at this room and say how many you know

344
00:13:43,230 --> 00:13:47,190
if it's a hundred square meters or what

345
00:13:44,910 --> 00:13:48,180
I can't it I have no no concept that at

346
00:13:47,190 --> 00:13:53,100
all

347
00:13:48,180 --> 00:13:55,349
and so I if you look up what is forty

348
00:13:53,100 --> 00:13:57,690
meters high in this case so I found the

349
00:13:55,350 --> 00:13:59,520
other statue of Christ in Rio de Janeiro

350
00:13:57,690 --> 00:14:01,500
it's forty meters high I've never been

351
00:13:59,520 --> 00:14:03,569
there so I can't really relate to it but

352
00:14:01,500 --> 00:14:05,100
I also found that hey the American space

353
00:14:03,570 --> 00:14:07,440
shuttle is 40 meters long

354
00:14:05,100 --> 00:14:09,720
and I've seen those and that's pretty

355
00:14:07,440 --> 00:14:11,730
big and I saw in my head I sort of

356
00:14:09,720 --> 00:14:13,500
thought why she left me she could turn

357
00:14:11,730 --> 00:14:16,800
one round and actually drop it next to

358
00:14:13,500 --> 00:14:18,720
the next to the water tower and actually

359
00:14:16,800 --> 00:14:19,829
the Russians they were on eBay I don't

360
00:14:18,720 --> 00:14:22,500
know if is eBay good another auction

361
00:14:19,830 --> 00:14:23,820
site they built a space shuttle which

362
00:14:22,500 --> 00:14:25,350
looks strangely like this one it's about

363
00:14:23,820 --> 00:14:26,910
a bit like how they had Concorde ski

364
00:14:25,350 --> 00:14:30,420
which strangely like Concorde the

365
00:14:26,910 --> 00:14:32,670
crashed a lot more they bought they

366
00:14:30,420 --> 00:14:34,370
built a space shuttle and they called it

367
00:14:32,670 --> 00:14:36,660
the Buran and apparently it did fly

368
00:14:34,370 --> 00:14:38,850
unmanned and then landed or something

369
00:14:36,660 --> 00:14:41,100
which may be propaganda it may have done

370
00:14:38,850 --> 00:14:44,250
that it got discontinued and the factory

371
00:14:41,100 --> 00:14:46,020
was still in the Ukraine and yeah they

372
00:14:44,250 --> 00:14:49,410
actually try settle some sell some of

373
00:14:46,020 --> 00:14:50,400
these and yeah I'd be a pretty cool

374
00:14:49,410 --> 00:14:51,480
thing to have you know your own

375
00:14:50,400 --> 00:14:54,420
spaceship who doesn't want their in

376
00:14:51,480 --> 00:14:56,490
spaceship you know so everyone to be

377
00:14:54,420 --> 00:14:59,339
very quiet yeah you've gotta have a big

378
00:14:56,490 --> 00:15:01,320
garden for spaceship but but yeah so I

379
00:14:59,340 --> 00:15:03,990
that picture in my head and and all that

380
00:15:01,320 --> 00:15:08,490
so anyway so yeah so the day day of the

381
00:15:03,990 --> 00:15:10,140
auction came and I flew out for the day

382
00:15:08,490 --> 00:15:11,700
he's they're expecting to pop in and

383
00:15:10,140 --> 00:15:13,740
then have a nice lunch and go to a

384
00:15:11,700 --> 00:15:19,950
gallery and wander around the parks and

385
00:15:13,740 --> 00:15:24,360
go home and yeah it was interesting so I

386
00:15:19,950 --> 00:15:26,040
flew over and got there and they said

387
00:15:24,360 --> 00:15:28,610
and said what I was there for and they

388
00:15:26,040 --> 00:15:30,599
greeted them they say ah mr. Fitzgerald

389
00:15:28,610 --> 00:15:31,339
you're the only person who's registered

390
00:15:30,600 --> 00:15:35,100
for the water

391
00:15:31,339 --> 00:15:38,100
so five euros it's yours and we were

392
00:15:35,100 --> 00:15:40,500
wondering who bought this and and what

393
00:15:38,100 --> 00:15:43,019
are you going to do with it and because

394
00:15:40,500 --> 00:15:44,880
I had totally expected just to be there

395
00:15:43,019 --> 00:15:47,820
to observe and sort of took me back a

396
00:15:44,880 --> 00:15:49,680
bit so I sort of thinking about that

397
00:15:47,820 --> 00:15:51,420
Space Shuttle thing so I said well could

398
00:15:49,680 --> 00:15:53,550
I could I put a burr on next to it and

399
00:15:51,420 --> 00:15:55,050
if you asked that question in England

400
00:15:53,550 --> 00:15:58,529
it'd be worn out of section 6 of the

401
00:15:55,050 --> 00:16:00,750
Planning Act you know very Drive English

402
00:15:58,529 --> 00:16:01,769
planners but like being said well it's

403
00:16:00,750 --> 00:16:07,320
yours you can do what you want with it

404
00:16:01,769 --> 00:16:09,360
so okay great so a little bit of

405
00:16:07,320 --> 00:16:13,769
paperwork later and yeah sort of five

406
00:16:09,360 --> 00:16:17,160
euros paid junk Tanner jumped in a taxi

407
00:16:13,769 --> 00:16:18,959
and went out to have a look at a look at

408
00:16:17,160 --> 00:16:22,019
the tower which is sort of half an hour

409
00:16:18,959 --> 00:16:25,529
outside Riga and a nice for sale sign on

410
00:16:22,019 --> 00:16:27,240
the bottom and I mean the building next

411
00:16:25,529 --> 00:16:29,430
to it in the in the photo here that

412
00:16:27,240 --> 00:16:32,339
that's a warehouse which is pretty high

413
00:16:29,430 --> 00:16:35,279
in itself and it's quite hard to get a

414
00:16:32,339 --> 00:16:37,740
actual sense of scale but I hadn't

415
00:16:35,279 --> 00:16:39,180
hadn't visited before and so yeah this

416
00:16:37,740 --> 00:16:43,620
was the first visit and had a look to

417
00:16:39,180 --> 00:16:46,010
see what there was no it said that the

418
00:16:43,620 --> 00:16:49,290
shed at the bottom was part the package

419
00:16:46,010 --> 00:16:54,390
which which actually appealed as much as

420
00:16:49,290 --> 00:16:57,269
the tower but yeah so I wouldn't went to

421
00:16:54,390 --> 00:16:59,130
explore a little bit and sort of went

422
00:16:57,269 --> 00:17:00,540
went in had a look and actually climbed

423
00:16:59,130 --> 00:17:03,329
climbed up to the top and it's all

424
00:17:00,540 --> 00:17:05,250
ladders and levels inside and I was

425
00:17:03,329 --> 00:17:06,569
expecting I mean they told me actually

426
00:17:05,250 --> 00:17:07,799
I'd asked you know can you go off list

427
00:17:06,569 --> 00:17:10,109
it now it's being pulled down but you

428
00:17:07,799 --> 00:17:13,079
can you climb in and go off all the

429
00:17:10,109 --> 00:17:14,458
matters and it's a bit dark damp that

430
00:17:13,079 --> 00:17:17,010
you you go up to the top

431
00:17:14,459 --> 00:17:18,870
so anyway onwards and upwards as be

432
00:17:17,010 --> 00:17:21,740
what's say so actually be what's is the

433
00:17:18,869 --> 00:17:24,780
British water tower appreciation society

434
00:17:21,740 --> 00:17:25,140
and of which of which I've since become

435
00:17:24,780 --> 00:17:27,540
a member

436
00:17:25,140 --> 00:17:29,370
interestingly if you if you want to

437
00:17:27,540 --> 00:17:30,570
become a member of the British water

438
00:17:29,370 --> 00:17:32,610
tower appreciation society and I'd

439
00:17:30,570 --> 00:17:35,189
encourage you all to do say there's a

440
00:17:32,610 --> 00:17:37,500
5-pound membership fee but if you're the

441
00:17:35,190 --> 00:17:40,980
owner at hour you get free membership so

442
00:17:37,500 --> 00:17:42,500
my five euros is you know quids and

443
00:17:40,980 --> 00:17:46,830
already

444
00:17:42,500 --> 00:17:49,860
so yeah so anyway went to explore the

445
00:17:46,830 --> 00:17:50,550
tower and actually yeah that's the view

446
00:17:49,860 --> 00:17:53,429
from the top

447
00:17:50,550 --> 00:17:55,320
and actually the don't down the bottom

448
00:17:53,430 --> 00:17:57,020
day you've got a as a lamppost if you

449
00:17:55,320 --> 00:18:00,059
think again we we look up normally to

450
00:17:57,020 --> 00:18:02,370
lampposts and you know streetlights and

451
00:18:00,059 --> 00:18:04,139
this is looking down on them and yeah

452
00:18:02,370 --> 00:18:07,860
it's beautiful place next to the lakes

453
00:18:04,140 --> 00:18:12,090
and all that but yeah the top is very

454
00:18:07,860 --> 00:18:14,189
scary which yeah some of my cousins are

455
00:18:12,090 --> 00:18:16,470
work on wind farms and things they're

456
00:18:14,190 --> 00:18:20,130
perfectly happy up that but not me

457
00:18:16,470 --> 00:18:21,929
so anyway we're dr. explore and you know

458
00:18:20,130 --> 00:18:26,610
have a look around and it was nice day

459
00:18:21,929 --> 00:18:29,640
and yeah scrambled down have a look in

460
00:18:26,610 --> 00:18:33,600
the shed and head back but no she the

461
00:18:29,640 --> 00:18:36,420
shed inside that a portrait is stolen in

462
00:18:33,600 --> 00:18:38,129
the back of it and the the papers from

463
00:18:36,420 --> 00:18:39,630
the guards who'd been guarding the site

464
00:18:38,130 --> 00:18:41,190
which should you know since been turned

465
00:18:39,630 --> 00:18:44,070
down and sort of seen see something the

466
00:18:41,190 --> 00:18:45,690
history of it but it's that's proper

467
00:18:44,070 --> 00:18:48,120
proper share to that one nicely

468
00:18:45,690 --> 00:18:53,250
insulated and stuff so yeah that was

469
00:18:48,120 --> 00:18:54,570
some exploring and find again so I've

470
00:18:53,250 --> 00:18:58,020
brought me all next so this question of

471
00:18:54,570 --> 00:19:00,030
well what to do with the tower and yeah

472
00:18:58,020 --> 00:19:02,010
there's a British tradition for making

473
00:19:00,030 --> 00:19:03,870
lists and things and I like ideas and

474
00:19:02,010 --> 00:19:05,850
exploring stuff so well we're gonna have

475
00:19:03,870 --> 00:19:08,189
a list of 101 things to do with water

476
00:19:05,850 --> 00:19:10,530
tower and actually from going up to the

477
00:19:08,190 --> 00:19:12,179
top discover that yeah well actually

478
00:19:10,530 --> 00:19:13,649
have to have a second list as well which

479
00:19:12,179 --> 00:19:16,980
is gonna be 101 ways to kill yourself on

480
00:19:13,650 --> 00:19:20,520
the tower which is probably an equally

481
00:19:16,980 --> 00:19:22,050
long list so yeah and actually yeah on

482
00:19:20,520 --> 00:19:24,210
that front the you know the British

483
00:19:22,050 --> 00:19:26,940
water tower appreciation society they

484
00:19:24,210 --> 00:19:29,340
have a very good language on this and on

485
00:19:26,940 --> 00:19:31,679
the website they they basically say that

486
00:19:29,340 --> 00:19:33,389
they encourage the responsible enjoyment

487
00:19:31,679 --> 00:19:37,050
of water towers which is best on from a

488
00:19:33,390 --> 00:19:41,340
distance and towers can have various

489
00:19:37,050 --> 00:19:42,659
risks def by falling death by things

490
00:19:41,340 --> 00:19:45,959
falling on you disease-carrying vermin

491
00:19:42,660 --> 00:19:48,510
open pits who sludge and asbestos and

492
00:19:45,960 --> 00:19:50,820
live wiring lots of our hassles as or

493
00:19:48,510 --> 00:19:52,260
hazards and you know it's sort of so

494
00:19:50,820 --> 00:19:55,320
busy of it

495
00:19:52,260 --> 00:19:58,440
so yeah so anyway um oh yeah actually

496
00:19:55,320 --> 00:20:02,309
from from visiting one of the things we

497
00:19:58,440 --> 00:20:03,540
did yeah I saw that actually the door so

498
00:20:02,309 --> 00:20:06,210
the entrance is down here at the bottom

499
00:20:03,540 --> 00:20:07,350
and yeah so being an IT person you've

500
00:20:06,210 --> 00:20:09,750
gotta have policies for everything

501
00:20:07,350 --> 00:20:12,480
haven't you especially you know any any

502
00:20:09,750 --> 00:20:14,130
organisation that's not tiny we thought

503
00:20:12,480 --> 00:20:16,500
well actually Latvians a very welcoming

504
00:20:14,130 --> 00:20:18,450
so we'll have an open-door policy given

505
00:20:16,500 --> 00:20:21,120
that we don't have a door that's a that

506
00:20:18,450 --> 00:20:23,730
seemed fitting so that was one of the

507
00:20:21,120 --> 00:20:26,580
first decisions there yeah so I shall

508
00:20:23,730 --> 00:20:29,370
talk to the water tower lots and yellow

509
00:20:26,580 --> 00:20:31,530
keen to do a tour of water towers and

510
00:20:29,370 --> 00:20:33,719
out of here and stuff and there are so

511
00:20:31,530 --> 00:20:35,250
many different designs of towers that

512
00:20:33,720 --> 00:20:37,679
you come across

513
00:20:35,250 --> 00:20:39,179
but yeah so I sort of had to go back

514
00:20:37,679 --> 00:20:41,250
that day and then organise a bit of a

515
00:20:39,179 --> 00:20:42,929
longer trip to come and explore the

516
00:20:41,250 --> 00:20:45,240
tower a bit more and then learn more

517
00:20:42,929 --> 00:20:48,299
about it so went back soon after that

518
00:20:45,240 --> 00:20:53,130
and did more of a sort of survey to look

519
00:20:48,299 --> 00:20:54,720
at the details and all that and yeah one

520
00:20:53,130 --> 00:20:57,390
things we did was clear up around the

521
00:20:54,720 --> 00:20:59,250
tower and so yeah that's sort of some of

522
00:20:57,390 --> 00:21:00,450
the stuff I cleared up and so yeah

523
00:20:59,250 --> 00:21:02,580
another thing we learned about the tower

524
00:21:00,450 --> 00:21:04,919
it's a great party venue and why was not

525
00:21:02,580 --> 00:21:08,040
invited those authorities that but again

526
00:21:04,919 --> 00:21:11,299
it made me realise that you know sort of

527
00:21:08,040 --> 00:21:13,770
finding there's bottles in the tower

528
00:21:11,299 --> 00:21:18,000
yeah I mean health and safety is a

529
00:21:13,770 --> 00:21:19,440
little bit behind roadies here but if

530
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:21,600
someone wants to get drunk and fall down

531
00:21:19,440 --> 00:21:23,540
you basically have about one point six

532
00:21:21,600 --> 00:21:26,399
seconds so good boys the world while you

533
00:21:23,540 --> 00:21:28,020
descend to your to your doom there I

534
00:21:26,400 --> 00:21:29,190
feel a bit bad and there's probably lots

535
00:21:28,020 --> 00:21:31,970
of paperwork if somebody did fall off

536
00:21:29,190 --> 00:21:37,290
saw fall you know could have a door so

537
00:21:31,970 --> 00:21:40,200
anyway but yeah so you know where the

538
00:21:37,290 --> 00:21:43,320
tower is is on the seaside in Latvia and

539
00:21:40,200 --> 00:21:45,750
it's it's beautiful place and it's has

540
00:21:43,320 --> 00:21:48,960
been like Miami Beach and then some are

541
00:21:45,750 --> 00:21:51,000
you yeah it's very shallow you go

542
00:21:48,960 --> 00:21:53,490
swimming and actually in winter people

543
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:56,220
ski on the beach and I normally

544
00:21:53,490 --> 00:21:57,840
associate beaches with you know people

545
00:21:56,220 --> 00:22:01,830
sunbathing and swimming and all that and

546
00:21:57,840 --> 00:22:03,030
seeing people skiing on a beach just

547
00:22:01,830 --> 00:22:04,799
sort of jar the first time you see it

548
00:22:03,030 --> 00:22:06,000
but actually you know when when the sea

549
00:22:04,799 --> 00:22:07,770
is frozen you can walk on

550
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:09,660
see and ski along the beach why not it's

551
00:22:07,770 --> 00:22:12,840
it's just one of those things that's bit

552
00:22:09,660 --> 00:22:14,250
like oh yeah you can tell you can tell

553
00:22:12,840 --> 00:22:15,629
what country or which part of the world

554
00:22:14,250 --> 00:22:17,970
people come from from how they eat

555
00:22:15,630 --> 00:22:19,950
banana for example so actually here how

556
00:22:17,970 --> 00:22:20,550
do you how do you eat a banana I shoulda

557
00:22:19,950 --> 00:22:24,150
brought one with me

558
00:22:20,550 --> 00:22:27,240
do you so we in England we take the

559
00:22:24,150 --> 00:22:31,410
stalk and peel it back and then eat your

560
00:22:27,240 --> 00:22:34,680
banana it's that same here oh I see

561
00:22:31,410 --> 00:22:36,240
you're like a monkey or like a Russian

562
00:22:34,680 --> 00:22:38,490
or an Eastern European in Eastern Europe

563
00:22:36,240 --> 00:22:41,370
we yeah so most people in Western Europe

564
00:22:38,490 --> 00:22:43,350
take stalk down whereas in in Eastern

565
00:22:41,370 --> 00:22:45,780
Europe they do it the other way so you

566
00:22:43,350 --> 00:22:47,189
should hold the stalk as more sensible

567
00:22:45,780 --> 00:22:48,030
to hold and you peel the other way and

568
00:22:47,190 --> 00:22:49,860
it's one of those things that if you're

569
00:22:48,030 --> 00:22:51,149
being told yeah it's just the way

570
00:22:49,860 --> 00:22:52,800
everyone does something you don't

571
00:22:51,150 --> 00:22:54,780
question it and it sort of makes you

572
00:22:52,800 --> 00:22:56,129
think more actually yeah why do we do it

573
00:22:54,780 --> 00:22:57,780
that way it's just some things that

574
00:22:56,130 --> 00:23:02,430
people always do like people carry on

575
00:22:57,780 --> 00:23:04,610
with so anyway so I took I spit so yeah

576
00:23:02,430 --> 00:23:07,260
nice nice area and actually once you

577
00:23:04,610 --> 00:23:08,850
once you get interested in water towers

578
00:23:07,260 --> 00:23:11,490
for example it used to start seeing them

579
00:23:08,850 --> 00:23:13,919
everywhere so it's been like I used to

580
00:23:11,490 --> 00:23:15,330
do cinema projection and on the old film

581
00:23:13,920 --> 00:23:17,070
projectors and when you have to change

582
00:23:15,330 --> 00:23:18,960
from one projector to the other you've

583
00:23:17,070 --> 00:23:20,429
got a little dot that flashes up for cue

584
00:23:18,960 --> 00:23:23,310
to get ready and then two seconds later

585
00:23:20,430 --> 00:23:26,190
it's changed for switching over and if

586
00:23:23,310 --> 00:23:28,230
it's alright then the film carries on

587
00:23:26,190 --> 00:23:29,460
and it's perfect and someone watching

588
00:23:28,230 --> 00:23:31,800
the film might just notice a little

589
00:23:29,460 --> 00:23:33,090
flash for a hair on the film or so but

590
00:23:31,800 --> 00:23:35,220
if you've done projection you know to

591
00:23:33,090 --> 00:23:37,889
look for those dots and you forever see

592
00:23:35,220 --> 00:23:40,740
them and you can't not see them so once

593
00:23:37,890 --> 00:23:41,940
you once you start noticing things you

594
00:23:40,740 --> 00:23:43,860
start seeing them everywhere it does is

595
00:23:41,940 --> 00:23:46,320
it it's interesting the designs of

596
00:23:43,860 --> 00:23:48,750
towers so these are three within two

597
00:23:46,320 --> 00:23:51,540
miles or five be a few kilometers of

598
00:23:48,750 --> 00:23:52,910
where where my tower is from different

599
00:23:51,540 --> 00:23:55,170
designs and different eras and

600
00:23:52,910 --> 00:23:58,050
apparently they're typically an

601
00:23:55,170 --> 00:23:59,510
architect's first project will be in

602
00:23:58,050 --> 00:24:01,980
many cases of auto tallix they're

603
00:23:59,510 --> 00:24:03,510
relatively simple utilitarian buildings

604
00:24:01,980 --> 00:24:06,650
but it's the way that you can actually

605
00:24:03,510 --> 00:24:09,210
express your individuality as well so

606
00:24:06,650 --> 00:24:11,820
yeah so now one of my brothers and

607
00:24:09,210 --> 00:24:13,080
people fly around the world they they

608
00:24:11,820 --> 00:24:14,580
take pictures of water towers and send

609
00:24:13,080 --> 00:24:15,659
and send them to me it's been like I

610
00:24:14,580 --> 00:24:17,490
know if you tell someone you're a Harry

611
00:24:15,660 --> 00:24:18,480
Potter fan also you all get you know

612
00:24:17,490 --> 00:24:18,790
you're going to end up with collection

613
00:24:18,480 --> 00:24:20,230
of six

614
00:24:18,790 --> 00:24:22,120
ones or some things everyone knows you

615
00:24:20,230 --> 00:24:24,760
like that and they send you stuff so

616
00:24:22,120 --> 00:24:28,899
yeah so yeah it's been interesting

617
00:24:24,760 --> 00:24:30,670
learning like that and yeah so

618
00:24:28,900 --> 00:24:32,410
interesting right right opposite our the

619
00:24:30,670 --> 00:24:35,650
Latvian government very kindly have also

620
00:24:32,410 --> 00:24:37,360
built a little park with some sort of

621
00:24:35,650 --> 00:24:40,450
picnicking facilities and people swim in

622
00:24:37,360 --> 00:24:44,169
the lake and actually very nice so yeah

623
00:24:40,450 --> 00:24:45,550
I think excited so yeah the design and

624
00:24:44,170 --> 00:24:47,920
the construction of the tower so one of

625
00:24:45,550 --> 00:24:49,659
the things in understanding the tower

626
00:24:47,920 --> 00:24:52,480
and thinking what can I do with this

627
00:24:49,660 --> 00:24:54,640
first of all is was working out well

628
00:24:52,480 --> 00:24:58,300
actually how is it built is it going to

629
00:24:54,640 --> 00:25:00,130
fall down and and so forth so I went to

630
00:24:58,300 --> 00:25:02,919
do a survey an interesting site so you

631
00:25:00,130 --> 00:25:04,360
can see here the design of these and a

632
00:25:02,920 --> 00:25:07,240
lot of the soviet system if you look at

633
00:25:04,360 --> 00:25:08,500
soviet aircraft soviet all sort of

634
00:25:07,240 --> 00:25:12,220
things on that they're designed to be

635
00:25:08,500 --> 00:25:13,540
built by unskilled labor so it's bit

636
00:25:12,220 --> 00:25:15,280
like the yak aircraft and stuff they're

637
00:25:13,540 --> 00:25:17,470
designed to be serviced by conscripts so

638
00:25:15,280 --> 00:25:18,850
with simple tools and tough life and

639
00:25:17,470 --> 00:25:22,300
fields and things and they in the same

640
00:25:18,850 --> 00:25:24,730
way these towers they're modular so they

641
00:25:22,300 --> 00:25:26,980
precast concrete and which basically

642
00:25:24,730 --> 00:25:28,630
brought sites stacked and have rebar and

643
00:25:26,980 --> 00:25:30,310
stuff to build them and you can make

644
00:25:28,630 --> 00:25:31,750
different configurations out of them so

645
00:25:30,310 --> 00:25:34,120
you have different numbers of the balls

646
00:25:31,750 --> 00:25:35,800
up at the top and different numbers of

647
00:25:34,120 --> 00:25:38,379
sections for how high you want it to be

648
00:25:35,800 --> 00:25:40,899
and so forth and this design is a very

649
00:25:38,380 --> 00:25:42,340
popular Latvian design and you see them

650
00:25:40,900 --> 00:25:44,110
all over the country with one ball of

651
00:25:42,340 --> 00:25:45,639
two balls with sometimes the balls

652
00:25:44,110 --> 00:25:48,330
back-to-back sometimes three balls

653
00:25:45,640 --> 00:25:51,370
facing each other all sorts of different

654
00:25:48,330 --> 00:25:54,280
combinations but it's sort of

655
00:25:51,370 --> 00:25:57,610
interesting sort of mass-produced design

656
00:25:54,280 --> 00:26:01,450
so yeah so inside basically each module

657
00:25:57,610 --> 00:26:05,530
has these bits of rebar which are they

658
00:26:01,450 --> 00:26:09,150
are thick thick steel very big and you

659
00:26:05,530 --> 00:26:11,560
and the joins between them are

660
00:26:09,150 --> 00:26:13,510
effectively it's constructed the same

661
00:26:11,560 --> 00:26:16,690
way the railways are constructed so if

662
00:26:13,510 --> 00:26:18,100
actually though they put a tall ground

663
00:26:16,690 --> 00:26:19,810
and important liquid metal in then it

664
00:26:18,100 --> 00:26:22,540
sort of makes a very permanent join and

665
00:26:19,810 --> 00:26:24,040
it's very very strong and there are more

666
00:26:22,540 --> 00:26:26,590
at the bottom and they surf in out up at

667
00:26:24,040 --> 00:26:29,320
the top but it basically it's held

668
00:26:26,590 --> 00:26:31,449
together with steel so yeah exploring up

669
00:26:29,320 --> 00:26:32,379
inside the tower you've got a number of

670
00:26:31,450 --> 00:26:34,389
ladders and levels

671
00:26:32,380 --> 00:26:36,120
and you sort of climb up and change

672
00:26:34,389 --> 00:26:39,809
level climb up change level climb up

673
00:26:36,120 --> 00:26:42,580
it's quite quite fun going up to the top

674
00:26:39,809 --> 00:26:43,928
you have to I was good to pull this half

675
00:26:42,580 --> 00:26:45,519
way to get your breath and stuff that

676
00:26:43,929 --> 00:26:50,289
because it is yeah it's basically 12

677
00:26:45,519 --> 00:26:52,480
stories of ladders so yeah anyway so

678
00:26:50,289 --> 00:26:53,889
going going up you then get to the top

679
00:26:52,480 --> 00:26:55,179
section and waiver up the balls and

680
00:26:53,889 --> 00:26:58,990
you've got one more ladder to get to the

681
00:26:55,179 --> 00:27:01,539
very top and you can then reach that

682
00:26:58,990 --> 00:27:04,870
this this the detail of the bottom of

683
00:27:01,539 --> 00:27:07,929
the of the lower tank and there are two

684
00:27:04,870 --> 00:27:10,508
two pipes so there's there's the main

685
00:27:07,929 --> 00:27:12,460
pipe which is the down pipe which would

686
00:27:10,509 --> 00:27:14,230
be just wide enough for a person to fit

687
00:27:12,460 --> 00:27:17,830
in I think and you don't want to get

688
00:27:14,230 --> 00:27:19,720
caught in that because that would yeah

689
00:27:17,830 --> 00:27:22,509
that would be hard to get out of if you

690
00:27:19,720 --> 00:27:26,080
if you fell in slip to the bottom and

691
00:27:22,509 --> 00:27:29,500
all that and the the smaller pipe over

692
00:27:26,080 --> 00:27:30,879
here is that's been sort of either cut

693
00:27:29,500 --> 00:27:32,909
off or may not have ever been connected

694
00:27:30,879 --> 00:27:35,320
so the water would have been pumped up

695
00:27:32,909 --> 00:27:36,940
from the small pipe all the time and

696
00:27:35,320 --> 00:27:39,039
trickle just with gravity over the top

697
00:27:36,940 --> 00:27:40,899
very very simple design and then fill up

698
00:27:39,039 --> 00:27:42,908
and then the big tank takes it out when

699
00:27:40,899 --> 00:27:45,820
it's needed for the industrial park next

700
00:27:42,909 --> 00:27:47,409
door so yeah there's sort of very simple

701
00:27:45,820 --> 00:27:49,120
things and actually water towers I've

702
00:27:47,409 --> 00:27:51,009
learned they're not about storing water

703
00:27:49,120 --> 00:27:52,090
so much that's what everyone thinks

704
00:27:51,009 --> 00:27:58,029
therefore they're more about balancing

705
00:27:52,090 --> 00:28:00,580
pressure and so forth so yeah so storing

706
00:27:58,029 --> 00:28:01,450
up and point is needed and yeah this

707
00:28:00,580 --> 00:28:03,699
particular tower

708
00:28:01,450 --> 00:28:09,519
I found they've all got plates on and

709
00:28:03,700 --> 00:28:13,389
this this one was built in 1887 yes 1987

710
00:28:09,519 --> 00:28:14,799
so it's about 30 years old now um so it

711
00:28:13,389 --> 00:28:17,080
would have been fairly fairly late one

712
00:28:14,799 --> 00:28:23,918
before was it 92 the curtain came down

713
00:28:17,080 --> 00:28:25,600
where about that so yeah yeah so up at

714
00:28:23,919 --> 00:28:27,549
the top sort of exploring up there you

715
00:28:25,600 --> 00:28:29,439
use the climb to the top from the top

716
00:28:27,549 --> 00:28:33,600
that last ladder look peer out over the

717
00:28:29,440 --> 00:28:37,409
top and yeah you've got a there's a

718
00:28:33,600 --> 00:28:37,408
barrier but

719
00:28:38,050 --> 00:28:44,149
it's there's no non-slip for surface

720
00:28:41,120 --> 00:28:47,659
there's yeah and if you fill against the

721
00:28:44,150 --> 00:28:50,620
perio it may hold you it may not no

722
00:28:47,660 --> 00:28:55,160
warranties on that that it's yeah that

723
00:28:50,620 --> 00:28:56,179
scares me shitless which which is good

724
00:28:55,160 --> 00:28:59,120
for self-preservation

725
00:28:56,180 --> 00:29:00,590
I guess but yeah you to explore off at

726
00:28:59,120 --> 00:29:02,000
the top and actually looking down into

727
00:29:00,590 --> 00:29:03,590
the big tank there's a ladder in there

728
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:05,210
as well so you can go down to clean it

729
00:29:03,590 --> 00:29:07,490
and climb into it

730
00:29:05,210 --> 00:29:09,670
I haven't actually ventured down into

731
00:29:07,490 --> 00:29:12,560
yet because I'm not quite sure how

732
00:29:09,670 --> 00:29:15,740
secure the steel is because up there

733
00:29:12,560 --> 00:29:19,179
nobody can hear you scream so I should

734
00:29:15,740 --> 00:29:22,280
and yeah and actually from up at the top

735
00:29:19,180 --> 00:29:24,410
last time I was there I was standing up

736
00:29:22,280 --> 00:29:26,660
at the top and yet one things we did was

737
00:29:24,410 --> 00:29:28,250
run a radio station from the top for

738
00:29:26,660 --> 00:29:29,450
Amber to the station put a huge long

739
00:29:28,250 --> 00:29:31,880
wire around Turner outs and that was

740
00:29:29,450 --> 00:29:35,090
great I was logged everything to the top

741
00:29:31,880 --> 00:29:38,300
and then I was standing up at the top

742
00:29:35,090 --> 00:29:41,110
and around the corner came these fire

743
00:29:38,300 --> 00:29:42,950
engines and police and stuff with the

744
00:29:41,110 --> 00:29:46,189
sirens wailing and stuff that I was

745
00:29:42,950 --> 00:29:47,930
thinking or someone seen me and you know

746
00:29:46,190 --> 00:29:50,030
once I'm going to jump or something like

747
00:29:47,930 --> 00:29:52,540
that and actually they hadn't someone

748
00:29:50,030 --> 00:29:55,190
unfortunately drowned in the lake that

749
00:29:52,540 --> 00:29:57,320
when you're up there you are you're sort

750
00:29:55,190 --> 00:29:58,850
of tiny nobody sees you because they

751
00:29:57,320 --> 00:30:00,560
just see the tower you're almost

752
00:29:58,850 --> 00:30:01,850
invisible up at the top so if you if you

753
00:30:00,560 --> 00:30:06,350
got in trouble like that you'd be pretty

754
00:30:01,850 --> 00:30:07,580
stuck so anyway um so after having sort

755
00:30:06,350 --> 00:30:09,919
of learnt about the tower and checking

756
00:30:07,580 --> 00:30:12,100
it stable and understanding at all I've

757
00:30:09,920 --> 00:30:13,510
done a bit of research and looking into

758
00:30:12,100 --> 00:30:15,830
[Music]

759
00:30:13,510 --> 00:30:18,530
yeah looking into how the design came

760
00:30:15,830 --> 00:30:21,830
about and excited that and I've learnt

761
00:30:18,530 --> 00:30:25,129
the story about this I'm not sure all

762
00:30:21,830 --> 00:30:25,879
quite how true it is but we'll see so

763
00:30:25,130 --> 00:30:29,900
apparently

764
00:30:25,880 --> 00:30:32,390
back in sort of late 70s or maybe early

765
00:30:29,900 --> 00:30:36,410
80s they I think probably accepted

766
00:30:32,390 --> 00:30:38,840
anyway the command economy they had us a

767
00:30:36,410 --> 00:30:42,200
committee meeting and as with all these

768
00:30:38,840 --> 00:30:44,480
things they they said oh yeah we need a

769
00:30:42,200 --> 00:30:46,390
new design of water tower - with these

770
00:30:44,480 --> 00:30:48,970
functional specifications

771
00:30:46,390 --> 00:30:50,290
to serve the needs of the economy for

772
00:30:48,970 --> 00:30:55,290
the next so many years and has has these

773
00:30:50,290 --> 00:30:58,210
parameters are all those details and

774
00:30:55,290 --> 00:31:00,760
typical design bureau stuff and with

775
00:30:58,210 --> 00:31:03,760
only meeting yeah one of the things I've

776
00:31:00,760 --> 00:31:05,379
found if you've got a boring meeting is

777
00:31:03,760 --> 00:31:09,960
there do seem to be a few universal

778
00:31:05,380 --> 00:31:12,310
truths and so allegedly there was a

779
00:31:09,960 --> 00:31:14,170
young engineer on the back he was a bit

780
00:31:12,310 --> 00:31:19,780
bored by this and he was sort of

781
00:31:14,170 --> 00:31:23,320
doodling away and so yeah any guesses

782
00:31:19,780 --> 00:31:27,399
for what the single most popular part of

783
00:31:23,320 --> 00:31:31,210
male anatomy is that you can do and it

784
00:31:27,400 --> 00:31:35,440
does seem to be universal truth so that

785
00:31:31,210 --> 00:31:37,870
was the US Navy pilots doing doing this

786
00:31:35,440 --> 00:31:40,060
one recently and who here went to the

787
00:31:37,870 --> 00:31:43,270
laser meet last week in the Netherlands

788
00:31:40,060 --> 00:31:47,020
ah I I understand there might have been

789
00:31:43,270 --> 00:31:49,420
similar images in laser display on the

790
00:31:47,020 --> 00:31:52,240
wall so yeah I was asking someone in the

791
00:31:49,420 --> 00:31:54,010
bar the other day here to fool me one of

792
00:31:52,240 --> 00:31:57,940
the pictures of these lasers displayed

793
00:31:54,010 --> 00:32:01,960
penises and he he must have I was a bit

794
00:31:57,940 --> 00:32:05,350
mad that yeah so anyway

795
00:32:01,960 --> 00:32:08,230
Yuri at the back I GABA was portents

796
00:32:05,350 --> 00:32:09,879
meetings and doodling away and he was

797
00:32:08,230 --> 00:32:13,450
called out Oh Yuri what do you what are

798
00:32:09,880 --> 00:32:14,890
you drawing and he's a quick thinker

799
00:32:13,450 --> 00:32:21,610
you've got to give him that because

800
00:32:14,890 --> 00:32:27,490
apparently what what happens do you want

801
00:32:21,610 --> 00:32:34,179
a tower design and apparently the the

802
00:32:27,490 --> 00:32:39,670
chat leader the meeting you know what

803
00:32:34,180 --> 00:32:43,960
this looks like to you yeah this is

804
00:32:39,670 --> 00:32:45,730
perfect because we will tell the Latvian

805
00:32:43,960 --> 00:32:48,880
people the oh we will show them that

806
00:32:45,730 --> 00:32:51,700
they are well and truly friends with

807
00:32:48,880 --> 00:32:54,640
Mother Russia and we will build many of

808
00:32:51,700 --> 00:32:56,020
these all over the countryside and we

809
00:32:54,640 --> 00:32:59,510
don't need any of his advice this is the

810
00:32:56,020 --> 00:33:01,490
one so

811
00:32:59,510 --> 00:33:03,590
I don't know if that's a true story that

812
00:33:01,490 --> 00:33:05,240
here's a good story anyway and the

813
00:33:03,590 --> 00:33:05,889
designer there was this chap eurisk

814
00:33:05,240 --> 00:33:08,300
albergues

815
00:33:05,890 --> 00:33:10,850
and actually he's a very famous Latvian

816
00:33:08,300 --> 00:33:13,010
designer his must be now in his 90s or

817
00:33:10,850 --> 00:33:15,350
something I'd love to meet him but he

818
00:33:13,010 --> 00:33:17,780
built many other concrete buildings and

819
00:33:15,350 --> 00:33:20,030
I guess same here you must have had that

820
00:33:17,780 --> 00:33:21,860
sort of sixties seventies modernist

821
00:33:20,030 --> 00:33:23,410
style of buildings but I think it's a

822
00:33:21,860 --> 00:33:26,750
lot of them now are being pulled apart

823
00:33:23,410 --> 00:33:28,430
and replaced by more modern buildings we

824
00:33:26,750 --> 00:33:31,760
think of all the concrete buildings as

825
00:33:28,430 --> 00:33:33,020
concrete monstrosities and you know just

826
00:33:31,760 --> 00:33:34,879
I mean they're designed for a certain

827
00:33:33,020 --> 00:33:36,770
life so municipal buildings schools and

828
00:33:34,880 --> 00:33:39,230
things are replaced by newer glass

829
00:33:36,770 --> 00:33:41,000
buildings I wonder in you know 30 40

830
00:33:39,230 --> 00:33:43,280
years time will people look back and say

831
00:33:41,000 --> 00:33:44,510
oh those glass monstrosities are awful

832
00:33:43,280 --> 00:33:46,010
and whatever they're being replaced by

833
00:33:44,510 --> 00:33:48,740
then if we think of those as being

834
00:33:46,010 --> 00:33:50,629
modern but will will people in future so

835
00:33:48,740 --> 00:33:54,020
so actually the water towers are

836
00:33:50,630 --> 00:33:57,440
probably his legacy because the other

837
00:33:54,020 --> 00:33:58,970
buildings are disappearing and being

838
00:33:57,440 --> 00:34:01,160
replaced by more modern urban

839
00:33:58,970 --> 00:34:03,260
architecture so probably at the water

840
00:34:01,160 --> 00:34:05,660
towers is what's going to what's going

841
00:34:03,260 --> 00:34:08,600
to remain so yeah so there's me up at

842
00:34:05,660 --> 00:34:09,889
the top of tower of radio now cm I'll

843
00:34:08,600 --> 00:34:12,350
say on the radio side I've got respect

844
00:34:09,889 --> 00:34:14,210
for those little little radio sets

845
00:34:12,350 --> 00:34:17,509
because if you by the time you've logged

846
00:34:14,210 --> 00:34:20,060
radios antennas lead acid batteries up

847
00:34:17,510 --> 00:34:23,179
to the top gone up and down you know is

848
00:34:20,060 --> 00:34:26,060
good exercise anyway put it that way so

849
00:34:23,179 --> 00:34:30,020
yeah we've we've done that so yeah we

850
00:34:26,060 --> 00:34:31,370
run a amateur station for the top that

851
00:34:30,020 --> 00:34:33,560
she had took for a documentary about

852
00:34:31,370 --> 00:34:35,299
water towers as well there was a couple

853
00:34:33,560 --> 00:34:37,190
in the States from Oregon who were doing

854
00:34:35,300 --> 00:34:38,720
a documentary on water towers so we went

855
00:34:37,190 --> 00:34:43,149
over and did it with filming and stuff

856
00:34:38,719 --> 00:34:45,620
with them and actually yeah you think of

857
00:34:43,149 --> 00:34:47,810
America as being very progressive don't

858
00:34:45,620 --> 00:34:49,850
you and actually it's like Colorado's

859
00:34:47,810 --> 00:34:51,168
probably Colorado's probably freer with

860
00:34:49,850 --> 00:34:53,960
cannabis and stuff than it is here now

861
00:34:51,168 --> 00:34:57,609
isn't it I think the Americans like the

862
00:34:53,960 --> 00:35:00,200
tax but actually interesting in in in

863
00:34:57,610 --> 00:35:02,420
Oregon where they came from it's illegal

864
00:35:00,200 --> 00:35:03,770
to fill your own car with petrol you

865
00:35:02,420 --> 00:35:05,840
have to go to a service station and

866
00:35:03,770 --> 00:35:07,700
someone fills it up for you and gives

867
00:35:05,840 --> 00:35:09,020
you a bill so in the land of the free

868
00:35:07,700 --> 00:35:11,000
you can't fill your own car

869
00:35:09,020 --> 00:35:11,300
yeah whereas we used to now in England

870
00:35:11,000 --> 00:35:12,530
you

871
00:35:11,300 --> 00:35:13,790
you know you have the automatic machines

872
00:35:12,530 --> 00:35:16,070
where there's nobody there at all you

873
00:35:13,790 --> 00:35:18,200
put your card in you pay and so all

874
00:35:16,070 --> 00:35:20,930
those sort of I guess the unions are

875
00:35:18,200 --> 00:35:22,100
strong they're the yeah it's just

876
00:35:20,930 --> 00:35:23,960
interesting learning about different

877
00:35:22,100 --> 00:35:26,600
things in different parts the world so

878
00:35:23,960 --> 00:35:28,460
yeah we've been experimenting with music

879
00:35:26,600 --> 00:35:30,860
in the tower as well we're doing a clip

880
00:35:28,460 --> 00:35:32,780
time and yeah one of the things we found

881
00:35:30,860 --> 00:35:34,700
is that actually being a sort of big

882
00:35:32,780 --> 00:35:36,950
resonant structure you don't need a big

883
00:35:34,700 --> 00:35:41,770
speaker to fill the place with music and

884
00:35:36,950 --> 00:35:45,410
it it works really well so we found

885
00:35:41,770 --> 00:35:47,750
actually one of my neighbors in my

886
00:35:45,410 --> 00:35:49,850
office is Chappell gem finder he's doing

887
00:35:47,750 --> 00:35:51,380
the Pogues and playing the fiddle so

888
00:35:49,850 --> 00:35:52,700
there's sort of fairy tales in New York

889
00:35:51,380 --> 00:35:54,230
and all that stuff but he now has a

890
00:35:52,700 --> 00:35:56,689
project called long player which is a

891
00:35:54,230 --> 00:35:58,790
piece of music so it runs at Rinty boy

892
00:35:56,690 --> 00:35:59,810
wharf in london where i'm and elsewhere

893
00:35:58,790 --> 00:36:01,090
and there's a piece of music that won't

894
00:35:59,810 --> 00:36:05,330
repeat in a thousand years

895
00:36:01,090 --> 00:36:08,450
mr. algorithmically generated and we

896
00:36:05,330 --> 00:36:11,029
yeah we we've got a set up for the tower

897
00:36:08,450 --> 00:36:12,350
so that you can you can play it there

898
00:36:11,030 --> 00:36:13,610
and I'm just trying to sort out the

899
00:36:12,350 --> 00:36:15,650
electricity and things like that at the

900
00:36:13,610 --> 00:36:17,210
moment and then yeah you can actually

901
00:36:15,650 --> 00:36:18,860
set it so from outside that's how you

902
00:36:17,210 --> 00:36:21,710
can you can hear it really clearly it's

903
00:36:18,860 --> 00:36:23,720
as if the tower is singing but you're

904
00:36:21,710 --> 00:36:26,120
making up this list of things to do the

905
00:36:23,720 --> 00:36:30,919
tower is slowly getting through stuff so

906
00:36:26,120 --> 00:36:32,359
yeah and again music in the tower how

907
00:36:30,920 --> 00:36:34,130
many people here have got one of those

908
00:36:32,360 --> 00:36:38,960
Alexa devices are real too paranoid to

909
00:36:34,130 --> 00:36:40,640
that who's got one a couple of few

910
00:36:38,960 --> 00:36:43,670
people yeah so one of the games I like

911
00:36:40,640 --> 00:36:46,430
to play with LexA is say Alexa play and

912
00:36:43,670 --> 00:36:48,950
then a random word and just about any

913
00:36:46,430 --> 00:36:50,750
word there is a song about it and it's a

914
00:36:48,950 --> 00:36:53,060
a good way of you know even ones you

915
00:36:50,750 --> 00:36:54,800
never think of I don't sort of like you

916
00:36:53,060 --> 00:36:55,640
know Alexa playing lemon jelly oh that's

917
00:36:54,800 --> 00:36:59,120
the name of a band they're quite good

918
00:36:55,640 --> 00:37:01,009
and if you do Alexa play water tower

919
00:36:59,120 --> 00:37:03,560
it comes up with ESOP rock and various

920
00:37:01,010 --> 00:37:09,350
sort of like grungy 8-bit music and all

921
00:37:03,560 --> 00:37:14,240
sorts of good stuff and yeah there's a

922
00:37:09,350 --> 00:37:16,960
lots lots to do yeah so we've now got a

923
00:37:14,240 --> 00:37:20,899
door on the tower after-after-party

924
00:37:16,960 --> 00:37:22,190
policy so we still got a policy of you

925
00:37:20,900 --> 00:37:23,100
know anyone's welcome to visit if they

926
00:37:22,190 --> 00:37:25,140
want but

927
00:37:23,100 --> 00:37:27,529
you just got to tell me that you've made

928
00:37:25,140 --> 00:37:31,589
peace of God and got life insurance and

929
00:37:27,530 --> 00:37:32,970
you know take your own risks that yeah

930
00:37:31,590 --> 00:37:40,080
so I'll give you the door code if you

931
00:37:32,970 --> 00:37:40,709
want if you fall from the tower am I

932
00:37:40,080 --> 00:37:48,710
responsible

933
00:37:40,710 --> 00:37:51,090
I'd feel a bit bad about it that's so

934
00:37:48,710 --> 00:37:55,920
yeah and in America your family would

935
00:37:51,090 --> 00:37:57,660
suit me but I mean in yeah so my

936
00:37:55,920 --> 00:38:00,140
understanding is if you if you go to lap

937
00:37:57,660 --> 00:38:02,520
you and fall off the tower

938
00:38:00,140 --> 00:38:04,770
yeah I'd feel bad about it but there's

939
00:38:02,520 --> 00:38:06,420
probably not it's it's a bit they're

940
00:38:04,770 --> 00:38:13,770
fairly common is fairly common sense so

941
00:38:06,420 --> 00:38:17,280
yeah yeah I would feel bad about it I

942
00:38:13,770 --> 00:38:18,509
say but you want one of the things yeah

943
00:38:17,280 --> 00:38:21,300
so we got this list of a hundred one

944
00:38:18,510 --> 00:38:23,040
things to do with water tower and and

945
00:38:21,300 --> 00:38:26,760
101 ways to kill you kill yourself in

946
00:38:23,040 --> 00:38:28,800
the water tower so one of them is yeah

947
00:38:26,760 --> 00:38:29,840
you know you could be romantic it's not

948
00:38:28,800 --> 00:38:32,790
far off

949
00:38:29,840 --> 00:38:35,400
February 14th and Valentine's Day here

950
00:38:32,790 --> 00:38:36,900
and so somebody might want to get people

951
00:38:35,400 --> 00:38:38,040
got engaged to the top of Watertown why

952
00:38:36,900 --> 00:38:39,660
not get married at the top of the water

953
00:38:38,040 --> 00:38:40,680
tower as well you know you have a small

954
00:38:39,660 --> 00:38:43,859
thing and a good excuse not to invite

955
00:38:40,680 --> 00:38:48,589
too many people and if it doesn't work

956
00:38:43,860 --> 00:38:48,590
out you go back and quickie divorce I

957
00:38:49,400 --> 00:38:56,490
don't recommend that then actually so

958
00:38:53,640 --> 00:38:59,400
yeah so you have done lots of learning

959
00:38:56,490 --> 00:39:01,310
and thinking and thinking actually what

960
00:38:59,400 --> 00:39:03,630
can what can you do with a tower and

961
00:39:01,310 --> 00:39:05,630
yeah I've got my so we've got these sort

962
00:39:03,630 --> 00:39:07,890
of two lists of things going on and

963
00:39:05,630 --> 00:39:10,440
there are all sort of things you can do

964
00:39:07,890 --> 00:39:12,750
so we can so for example you turn it

965
00:39:10,440 --> 00:39:15,270
into the ultimate air B&B in that yeah

966
00:39:12,750 --> 00:39:18,390
why not turn it into a house and you

967
00:39:15,270 --> 00:39:21,120
know oh yeah so after this I'm also aim

968
00:39:18,390 --> 00:39:23,339
for a workshop so it's one things I want

969
00:39:21,120 --> 00:39:24,509
to do is put a flame throw up at the top

970
00:39:23,340 --> 00:39:27,900
because you can see the water tower as

971
00:39:24,510 --> 00:39:30,240
you fly in and you know at the aircraft

972
00:39:27,900 --> 00:39:33,810
cockpit and all pilots know Morse code

973
00:39:30,240 --> 00:39:36,229
so be nice to say hello or something

974
00:39:33,810 --> 00:39:38,000
else from that and

975
00:39:36,230 --> 00:39:39,230
sort of you know why not have a bit of

976
00:39:38,000 --> 00:39:40,220
flame come from the top of the tower and

977
00:39:39,230 --> 00:39:41,869
then people would look at the top of the

978
00:39:40,220 --> 00:39:43,189
tower

979
00:39:41,869 --> 00:39:44,960
but Ashley and that's led on to

980
00:39:43,190 --> 00:39:47,780
something else in that if you think

981
00:39:44,960 --> 00:39:49,520
about flames and beacons so you know

982
00:39:47,780 --> 00:39:51,230
what's the world what what's the most of

983
00:39:49,520 --> 00:39:52,970
what's the most famous Olympic flame Oh

984
00:39:51,230 --> 00:39:54,890
what's the most for the famous flame

985
00:39:52,970 --> 00:39:56,839
it's the Olympic flame and there's also

986
00:39:54,890 --> 00:39:59,000
movement to to introduce the Baltic

987
00:39:56,839 --> 00:40:00,140
Olympics around 2040 or 2045 or

988
00:39:59,000 --> 00:40:02,450
something that really feeling you and

989
00:40:00,140 --> 00:40:05,598
stone you're teaming up and that'd be

990
00:40:02,450 --> 00:40:07,640
great so yeah but anyway we've got all

991
00:40:05,599 --> 00:40:09,290
these different things planned to do and

992
00:40:07,640 --> 00:40:11,000
basically think of it as a as a blank

993
00:40:09,290 --> 00:40:12,619
canvas there are some things I have

994
00:40:11,000 --> 00:40:15,770
opportunity cost of if you do them you

995
00:40:12,619 --> 00:40:17,930
don't do other things again um it's like

996
00:40:15,770 --> 00:40:19,910
you could actually flood the whole thing

997
00:40:17,930 --> 00:40:22,190
and use it as a submarine escape

998
00:40:19,910 --> 00:40:23,420
training tower because those are

999
00:40:22,190 --> 00:40:25,099
generally about 40 meters high and

1000
00:40:23,420 --> 00:40:28,220
learning how to escape from a submarine

1001
00:40:25,099 --> 00:40:30,260
if you ever need to so or actually

1002
00:40:28,220 --> 00:40:31,700
interestingly most the old submarines

1003
00:40:30,260 --> 00:40:34,700
that had escape hatches they've got

1004
00:40:31,700 --> 00:40:36,859
welded shut in wartime because what

1005
00:40:34,700 --> 00:40:39,828
people found was if you had a so I like

1006
00:40:36,859 --> 00:40:42,290
submarines my ultimate house well that's

1007
00:40:39,829 --> 00:40:45,109
my aesthetic anyway if you drop a deft

1008
00:40:42,290 --> 00:40:46,609
depth charge down and it goes off near a

1009
00:40:45,109 --> 00:40:48,560
submarine it basically causes an

1010
00:40:46,609 --> 00:40:50,328
expansion bubble and stuff and that was

1011
00:40:48,560 --> 00:40:52,040
causing the emergency escape hatches to

1012
00:40:50,329 --> 00:40:55,250
pop open flood submarine and everyone

1013
00:40:52,040 --> 00:40:57,710
dies so for safety they welded shut the

1014
00:40:55,250 --> 00:40:59,750
escape hatches but I think more modern

1015
00:40:57,710 --> 00:41:03,619
submarines they're back in service again

1016
00:40:59,750 --> 00:41:04,099
and depth charges yeah anyway sorry I

1017
00:41:03,619 --> 00:41:06,589
digress

1018
00:41:04,099 --> 00:41:07,790
I did a lot so yeah I've been thinking

1019
00:41:06,589 --> 00:41:09,950
about all these things to do with the

1020
00:41:07,790 --> 00:41:11,390
tower and I'd be curious for ideas

1021
00:41:09,950 --> 00:41:13,700
because it's a blank canvas and it's

1022
00:41:11,390 --> 00:41:16,310
available for you new music things and

1023
00:41:13,700 --> 00:41:18,200
arts and science and turned it into

1024
00:41:16,310 --> 00:41:19,578
different things and waste lovely

1025
00:41:18,200 --> 00:41:21,560
experimental and I like the whole

1026
00:41:19,579 --> 00:41:23,810
process of working out can we do this

1027
00:41:21,560 --> 00:41:25,759
and sorry how many records can you break

1028
00:41:23,810 --> 00:41:31,869
with the tower and all sorts of things

1029
00:41:25,760 --> 00:41:36,800
so yeah so been doing lots of thinking

1030
00:41:31,869 --> 00:41:44,750
hang on sorry

1031
00:41:36,800 --> 00:41:46,460
oh yeah oh and then yeah so so yeah

1032
00:41:44,750 --> 00:41:48,230
what's left to do with the tower so um

1033
00:41:46,460 --> 00:41:52,390
yeah one we've got a reverse the

1034
00:41:48,230 --> 00:41:54,860
shrinking beam so that's one of those um

1035
00:41:52,390 --> 00:41:56,150
like Taj Mahal type pictures where you

1036
00:41:54,860 --> 00:42:00,920
just put it in a different perspective

1037
00:41:56,150 --> 00:42:02,780
so yeah be fun to break some records and

1038
00:42:00,920 --> 00:42:05,180
yeah light some fires on the top and all

1039
00:42:02,780 --> 00:42:06,640
that and yeah there's practical things

1040
00:42:05,180 --> 00:42:09,470
like trying to get electricity to it and

1041
00:42:06,640 --> 00:42:11,089
I quite like the idea of putting solar

1042
00:42:09,470 --> 00:42:12,439
panels on site or wind generator the

1043
00:42:11,090 --> 00:42:15,560
talks with the height you do get a fair

1044
00:42:12,440 --> 00:42:18,200
bit of wind but the bureaucracy involved

1045
00:42:15,560 --> 00:42:20,840
getting electricity supplies is

1046
00:42:18,200 --> 00:42:24,770
something else and learning how well

1047
00:42:20,840 --> 00:42:27,440
that works and yeah do that long fire

1048
00:42:24,770 --> 00:42:29,840
thing and generally the project have

1049
00:42:27,440 --> 00:42:31,370
been fun with and it's been quite a

1050
00:42:29,840 --> 00:42:34,310
learning experience as well actually lot

1051
00:42:31,370 --> 00:42:38,089
last time I went there the shed at the

1052
00:42:34,310 --> 00:42:39,290
bottom which one of our neighbors with

1053
00:42:38,090 --> 00:42:41,360
the warehouse next door to it

1054
00:42:39,290 --> 00:42:44,330
they had appropriated it and changed the

1055
00:42:41,360 --> 00:42:45,710
locks and we had a sort of big argument

1056
00:42:44,330 --> 00:42:48,920
about it and they were claiming it when

1057
00:42:45,710 --> 00:42:54,230
they'd bought it and I pretty confident

1058
00:42:48,920 --> 00:42:56,930
I had but as I had but if you don't know

1059
00:42:54,230 --> 00:42:58,730
the native law I wasn't quite confident

1060
00:42:56,930 --> 00:43:00,529
enough not to risk going to let me in

1061
00:42:58,730 --> 00:43:03,410
jail and given the policemen have guns

1062
00:43:00,530 --> 00:43:09,470
and stuff didn't want to risk that but

1063
00:43:03,410 --> 00:43:11,480
um yeah so yeah this is my ongoing

1064
00:43:09,470 --> 00:43:13,100
project looking at things to do with the

1065
00:43:11,480 --> 00:43:15,170
tower and doing some of them if anyone

1066
00:43:13,100 --> 00:43:18,770
has any idea isn't welcome welcome those

1067
00:43:15,170 --> 00:43:21,020
and if you want to visit us in in Latvia

1068
00:43:18,770 --> 00:43:24,890
and sort of 20 minutes from the centre

1069
00:43:21,020 --> 00:43:27,560
and yeah actually these are good Latvian

1070
00:43:24,890 --> 00:43:30,560
technology as well they made in made in

1071
00:43:27,560 --> 00:43:32,150
Riga so yeah Latvian let me stop

1072
00:43:30,560 --> 00:43:35,060
everywhere Christmas trees to come from

1073
00:43:32,150 --> 00:43:39,500
that view anyway um yes anyone have any

1074
00:43:35,060 --> 00:43:41,570
questions so oh yeah you know hello yes

1075
00:43:39,500 --> 00:43:43,370
do you have any ideas for what happens

1076
00:43:41,570 --> 00:43:47,060
in what you want to do inside of the

1077
00:43:43,370 --> 00:43:49,339
actual tank balls at the top of the so

1078
00:43:47,060 --> 00:43:50,080
yeah um there's a few things you can do

1079
00:43:49,340 --> 00:43:52,869
with it

1080
00:43:50,080 --> 00:43:54,490
we fill of water of again those things

1081
00:43:52,869 --> 00:43:56,800
like can you actually use its tool power

1082
00:43:54,490 --> 00:43:58,540
and store electricity by pumping water

1083
00:43:56,800 --> 00:44:01,030
at the top and then running it through a

1084
00:43:58,540 --> 00:44:05,440
turbine or can you have a big salt

1085
00:44:01,030 --> 00:44:06,849
battery up at the top or actual if you

1086
00:44:05,440 --> 00:44:09,849
have water in it you can also dispose of

1087
00:44:06,849 --> 00:44:11,320
dead bodies in it there these are these

1088
00:44:09,849 --> 00:44:13,180
are things have done so you know you

1089
00:44:11,320 --> 00:44:16,410
research all these things they have that

1090
00:44:13,180 --> 00:44:19,779
in America few years ago where someone

1091
00:44:16,410 --> 00:44:23,649
may have fallen in to a water tank or

1092
00:44:19,780 --> 00:44:24,970
may have been put in there and the yeah

1093
00:44:23,650 --> 00:44:27,400
if a body's in water for a certain

1094
00:44:24,970 --> 00:44:29,560
amount of time all any evidence of

1095
00:44:27,400 --> 00:44:32,099
anything disappears and what starts to

1096
00:44:29,560 --> 00:44:37,049
taste funny which how they caught it but

1097
00:44:32,099 --> 00:44:40,560
anyway sorry I digress

1098
00:44:37,050 --> 00:44:42,820
was the question to do with the tank

1099
00:44:40,560 --> 00:44:43,930
yeah say I mean again you could use it

1100
00:44:42,820 --> 00:44:46,420
as things like simple things like a

1101
00:44:43,930 --> 00:44:48,069
geocache would might be a fun thing I

1102
00:44:46,420 --> 00:44:50,020
seem to have gotten out of fashion a bit

1103
00:44:48,070 --> 00:44:53,400
but so geocaching and stuff most people

1104
00:44:50,020 --> 00:44:56,109
got advanced GPS is less to reveal now

1105
00:44:53,400 --> 00:44:58,839
but yeah potentially is it's quite a big

1106
00:44:56,109 --> 00:44:59,920
area and the scale of it potentially

1107
00:44:58,839 --> 00:45:01,750
they could be opened up and actually

1108
00:44:59,920 --> 00:45:05,050
converted into space you can walk around

1109
00:45:01,750 --> 00:45:06,820
and use more usefully it is quite thin

1110
00:45:05,050 --> 00:45:08,950
so I've got a design for a house as well

1111
00:45:06,820 --> 00:45:09,430
where you've got you know twelve

1112
00:45:08,950 --> 00:45:10,990
different

1113
00:45:09,430 --> 00:45:13,270
tiny rooms so there's enough room to lie

1114
00:45:10,990 --> 00:45:16,479
down and you know I like the idea of

1115
00:45:13,270 --> 00:45:17,980
efficiency of a space like bit like the

1116
00:45:16,480 --> 00:45:20,080
design of the inside of a boat or

1117
00:45:17,980 --> 00:45:21,970
something and having services and

1118
00:45:20,080 --> 00:45:24,339
somewhere sleep somewhere to cook

1119
00:45:21,970 --> 00:45:29,109
somewhere to do different things so yeah

1120
00:45:24,339 --> 00:45:31,119
ok so you can put 40 cubic meters of

1121
00:45:29,109 --> 00:45:34,240
water in so I mean they're they're not

1122
00:45:31,119 --> 00:45:35,710
huge as far as some towers go it's more

1123
00:45:34,240 --> 00:45:39,459
of a lots of storage and balancing the

1124
00:45:35,710 --> 00:45:41,290
pressure out in this case but yeah a big

1125
00:45:39,460 --> 00:45:42,310
enough to be useful for something so you

1126
00:45:41,290 --> 00:45:47,160
wouldn't want them to fall in your hair

1127
00:45:42,310 --> 00:45:51,460
diver do you plan on upgrading the

1128
00:45:47,160 --> 00:45:53,740
ladders so at the moment they are

1129
00:45:51,460 --> 00:45:54,940
they're in good state so I mean there's

1130
00:45:53,740 --> 00:45:58,060
a bit of surface corrosion but I've

1131
00:45:54,940 --> 00:46:00,820
taken taken sanding paper and all the

1132
00:45:58,060 --> 00:46:03,549
metal it's good industrial house or high

1133
00:46:00,820 --> 00:46:03,940
carbon steel and you take away surface

1134
00:46:03,550 --> 00:46:05,170
corrosion

1135
00:46:03,940 --> 00:46:08,290
you've got my shiny metal underneath

1136
00:46:05,170 --> 00:46:09,820
there so it's it's pretty sturdy but to

1137
00:46:08,290 --> 00:46:11,440
make the space useful the ladders dual

1138
00:46:09,820 --> 00:46:13,030
moment take much the space of the center

1139
00:46:11,440 --> 00:46:14,830
of the tower if you wanted to use that

1140
00:46:13,030 --> 00:46:17,050
space fine again so I probably moved the

1141
00:46:14,830 --> 00:46:20,160
the ladder to be against one of the end

1142
00:46:17,050 --> 00:46:23,410
walls and you can then put flaws in and

1143
00:46:20,160 --> 00:46:24,040
use the space much more usefully so the

1144
00:46:23,410 --> 00:46:25,899
right now

1145
00:46:24,040 --> 00:46:27,340
yeah they serve the purpose for getting

1146
00:46:25,900 --> 00:46:31,900
to the top and there's enough room to

1147
00:46:27,340 --> 00:46:34,060
move around and yeah I was given a

1148
00:46:31,900 --> 00:46:35,740
chance with one of my cousins of how

1149
00:46:34,060 --> 00:46:37,180
many members of the Latvian Symphony

1150
00:46:35,740 --> 00:46:39,759
Orchestra could you get into the tower

1151
00:46:37,180 --> 00:46:43,710
and yeah quite a fuse but you'd have to

1152
00:46:39,760 --> 00:46:47,860
be careful not to fall off or something

1153
00:46:43,710 --> 00:46:50,200
an elevator there's not really enough

1154
00:46:47,860 --> 00:46:52,750
room to put an elevator in I mean you

1155
00:46:50,200 --> 00:46:54,580
could put something in perhaps but I

1156
00:46:52,750 --> 00:46:56,950
would then take most the room use the

1157
00:46:54,580 --> 00:46:58,870
space I meant more for of goods maybe to

1158
00:46:56,950 --> 00:47:01,270
get it up the tower alright so actually

1159
00:46:58,870 --> 00:47:03,430
what I've done Henry's just have put a

1160
00:47:01,270 --> 00:47:05,470
rope over the edge and tie it at the

1161
00:47:03,430 --> 00:47:08,319
bottom and lift a bucket right or lift

1162
00:47:05,470 --> 00:47:23,470
something up that way which which works

1163
00:47:08,320 --> 00:47:24,730
pretty well okay thank you they were

1164
00:47:23,470 --> 00:47:26,259
curious for what to do with Bertie I

1165
00:47:24,730 --> 00:47:27,400
mean in England we have grand designs

1166
00:47:26,260 --> 00:47:30,610
and stuff and I don't think that's got

1167
00:47:27,400 --> 00:47:32,290
to Latvia yet so because we have people

1168
00:47:30,610 --> 00:47:34,480
convert into houses and and all that

1169
00:47:32,290 --> 00:47:36,009
this this one's an awkward shape so but

1170
00:47:34,480 --> 00:47:37,540
I think it could be converted but it's

1171
00:47:36,010 --> 00:47:37,960
just try and work work out what to do

1172
00:47:37,540 --> 00:47:41,560
with it

1173
00:47:37,960 --> 00:47:43,870
so that's the current plan so yeah any

1174
00:47:41,560 --> 00:47:46,200
other any other questions oh come on

1175
00:47:43,870 --> 00:47:46,200
over here

1176
00:47:48,339 --> 00:48:02,420
oops sorry maybe you could make an

1177
00:47:57,910 --> 00:48:06,410
external elevator on the other side yeah

1178
00:48:02,420 --> 00:48:07,789
possibly you have to be careful about I

1179
00:48:06,410 --> 00:48:09,499
suppose yeah if it was close in who

1180
00:48:07,789 --> 00:48:12,579
wouldn't have too much turning effect

1181
00:48:09,499 --> 00:48:15,019
oh she up at the top you do notice that

1182
00:48:12,579 --> 00:48:17,420
be like very tall buildings if it does

1183
00:48:15,019 --> 00:48:19,910
wobble a little bit but it's designed to

1184
00:48:17,420 --> 00:48:21,380
do that and I guess the fact that the

1185
00:48:19,910 --> 00:48:23,538
water isn't in there sort of probably

1186
00:48:21,380 --> 00:48:25,039
encourage some offices lighter yeah you

1187
00:48:23,539 --> 00:48:27,979
could but why not use the ladders keeps

1188
00:48:25,039 --> 00:48:30,190
off it it's a that's been my thinking

1189
00:48:27,979 --> 00:48:36,019
it's uh it's cheaper and better for you

1190
00:48:30,190 --> 00:48:38,479
yeah thanks yeah concrete or steel

1191
00:48:36,019 --> 00:48:40,308
they're steel so all the pipe work and

1192
00:48:38,479 --> 00:48:42,129
the ladders they're steel and it's just

1193
00:48:40,309 --> 00:48:47,650
the outside that's concrete then modular

1194
00:48:42,130 --> 00:48:50,329
so yeah any other any other questions no

1195
00:48:47,650 --> 00:48:51,829
no okay cool I'm off to learn how to do

1196
00:48:50,329 --> 00:48:54,890
flamethrowers so you might see those

1197
00:48:51,829 --> 00:48:55,950
it's helped see cool thank you thank you

1198
00:48:54,890 --> 00:49:03,480
so much Spencer

1199
00:48:55,950 --> 00:49:03,480
[Applause]
