1
00:00:04,990 --> 00:00:11,900
okay so it hello everyone I'm Matt and

2
00:00:08,090 --> 00:00:16,308
this is the story of how I ended up

3
00:00:11,900 --> 00:00:21,320
doing spectrum development for a major

4
00:00:16,309 --> 00:00:24,710
TV show in 2018 which is kind of odd for

5
00:00:21,320 --> 00:00:26,390
spectrum development so it's like so

6
00:00:24,710 --> 00:00:28,699
first of all there's a node there art of

7
00:00:26,390 --> 00:00:32,210
mine earth Bandersnatch black narrow

8
00:00:28,699 --> 00:00:36,140
spoilers in this I'll try not to give

9
00:00:32,210 --> 00:00:38,210
away this of too much but yeah so as

10
00:00:36,140 --> 00:00:43,369
you've probably gathered from Earth of

11
00:00:38,210 --> 00:00:47,269
previous days here I'm very much a ZX

12
00:00:43,369 --> 00:00:51,799
spectrum obsessive the home computer

13
00:00:47,269 --> 00:00:55,549
from the 1980s particularly begin the UK

14
00:00:51,799 --> 00:01:00,049
and also yeah some extent the rest of

15
00:00:55,549 --> 00:01:03,110
Europe too and my particular main angle

16
00:01:00,049 --> 00:01:05,269
on this is through the demo scene for

17
00:01:03,110 --> 00:01:07,460
those of you who haven't encountered the

18
00:01:05,269 --> 00:01:10,280
demo scene it's an international

19
00:01:07,460 --> 00:01:12,740
community of hackers graphic artists and

20
00:01:10,280 --> 00:01:16,820
musicians who are producing these

21
00:01:12,740 --> 00:01:19,850
real-time video art pieces a kind of in

22
00:01:16,820 --> 00:01:22,669
similar format to that music videos but

23
00:01:19,850 --> 00:01:26,960
with the visuals all generated in real

24
00:01:22,670 --> 00:01:29,299
time and these things the the creativity

25
00:01:26,960 --> 00:01:33,139
of it is very much driven by the

26
00:01:29,299 --> 00:01:35,929
programmers and exploring what they can

27
00:01:33,140 --> 00:01:39,789
do under their chosen constraints which

28
00:01:35,929 --> 00:01:45,049
might be and anything from that those

29
00:01:39,789 --> 00:01:48,740
top-of-the-range pcs and saying how you

30
00:01:45,049 --> 00:01:52,130
how you can push the topping graphics

31
00:01:48,740 --> 00:01:54,439
card to the lowness or seeing how much

32
00:01:52,130 --> 00:01:57,740
you can do in like four kilobytes of

33
00:01:54,439 --> 00:02:02,288
code or write down terse of where my

34
00:01:57,740 --> 00:02:05,030
particular interest is in creating these

35
00:02:02,289 --> 00:02:08,869
visual effects and things on the retro

36
00:02:05,030 --> 00:02:11,300
computers like the spectrum and I've

37
00:02:08,869 --> 00:02:13,550
there beyond the demo scene of kind of

38
00:02:11,300 --> 00:02:15,710
branched out in terms of other bits of

39
00:02:13,550 --> 00:02:17,849
still them within the the general theme

40
00:02:15,710 --> 00:02:22,129
of just showing off with respect

41
00:02:17,849 --> 00:02:25,858
I did a music video for a local band

42
00:02:22,129 --> 00:02:28,858
that runs on the spectrum there's also

43
00:02:25,859 --> 00:02:31,170
this is the on the right there's this is

44
00:02:28,859 --> 00:02:34,409
projects I did with the Museum of the

45
00:02:31,170 --> 00:02:38,159
history of science in Oxford and where

46
00:02:34,409 --> 00:02:40,980
we networked I think 10 or 12 spectrums

47
00:02:38,159 --> 00:02:44,939
together to make an orchestra that would

48
00:02:40,980 --> 00:02:46,530
play a mullahs first symphony and in a

49
00:02:44,939 --> 00:02:48,689
tribute to her face there was an

50
00:02:46,530 --> 00:02:51,480
exercise in the spectrum manual it

51
00:02:48,689 --> 00:02:55,078
showed you how to to play there yeah use

52
00:02:51,480 --> 00:02:57,090
the the beat commander no no use this to

53
00:02:55,079 --> 00:03:02,400
as a play the whole of mal was first

54
00:02:57,090 --> 00:03:05,430
symphony and for EMF last year is had

55
00:03:02,400 --> 00:03:07,739
created this of giants of bouncy castle

56
00:03:05,430 --> 00:03:11,129
version of a spectrum which was actually

57
00:03:07,739 --> 00:03:13,409
inspired by a commenter to shower the

58
00:03:11,129 --> 00:03:16,260
year before which is when I did a

59
00:03:13,409 --> 00:03:19,138
presentation on doing chip tunes on the

60
00:03:16,260 --> 00:03:21,750
spectrum and so Jenny tweeted I've never

61
00:03:19,139 --> 00:03:23,909
seen a spectrum screen this large it's

62
00:03:21,750 --> 00:03:27,239
well maybe we should have a giant

63
00:03:23,909 --> 00:03:30,989
spectrum to go with that as well yeah oh

64
00:03:27,239 --> 00:03:32,669
yeah yeah quite possibly and of course

65
00:03:30,989 --> 00:03:35,659
the oaf if you're around her last night

66
00:03:32,669 --> 00:03:38,970
you'll know that I have my alter-ego as

67
00:03:35,659 --> 00:03:42,179
the world's number ones that expect from

68
00:03:38,970 --> 00:03:46,169
rock star and so through the others

69
00:03:42,180 --> 00:03:48,540
general exploits I've kind of built up

70
00:03:46,169 --> 00:03:51,180
over the over time this kind of

71
00:03:48,540 --> 00:03:54,629
extensive social circles that know me as

72
00:03:51,180 --> 00:03:58,220
that spectrum guy and it's um through

73
00:03:54,629 --> 00:04:01,290
that that's that's that's a occasionally

74
00:03:58,220 --> 00:04:04,009
spun off in terms of opportunities like

75
00:04:01,290 --> 00:04:07,759
this one so this is an Chris Miller

76
00:04:04,009 --> 00:04:11,429
otherwise known as C tricks are is a an

77
00:04:07,759 --> 00:04:14,789
amazing chiptune musician on that they

78
00:04:11,430 --> 00:04:18,780
on Gameboy and Sega and Nintendo has all

79
00:04:14,789 --> 00:04:21,539
sorts and and so and he's have got in

80
00:04:18,779 --> 00:04:24,440
touch because this was through a like a

81
00:04:21,539 --> 00:04:28,349
friend of a friend whose

82
00:04:24,440 --> 00:04:30,659
who has been contacted by this producer

83
00:04:28,349 --> 00:04:31,920
for a TV show that you'll have

84
00:04:30,659 --> 00:04:34,020
definitely heard

85
00:04:31,920 --> 00:04:36,750
and they were looking for some spectrum

86
00:04:34,020 --> 00:04:39,599
code to be done for that so yep I said

87
00:04:36,750 --> 00:04:44,970
that sounds like something I'll be up

88
00:04:39,600 --> 00:04:47,360
for so he put me in touch with Russell

89
00:04:44,970 --> 00:04:50,490
McLean who's one of the producers of

90
00:04:47,360 --> 00:04:52,290
Black Mirror incidentally I don't know

91
00:04:50,490 --> 00:04:54,540
exactly how he ended up through this

92
00:04:52,290 --> 00:04:56,490
particular sub chain of contacts and I

93
00:04:54,540 --> 00:04:58,320
cuz I promptly this friend of a friend

94
00:04:56,490 --> 00:05:01,020
has just contacted out of the blue so

95
00:04:58,320 --> 00:05:06,030
it's a but yeah it ended dr. Thor the

96
00:05:01,020 --> 00:05:08,760
via hot potato in my hands so on the off

97
00:05:06,030 --> 00:05:10,799
chance that anyone familiar with Black

98
00:05:08,760 --> 00:05:13,560
Mirror it's this science fiction drama

99
00:05:10,800 --> 00:05:16,230
series it's taking this really dark tone

100
00:05:13,560 --> 00:05:18,930
exploring like the near future

101
00:05:16,230 --> 00:05:22,860
implications of today's technology and

102
00:05:18,930 --> 00:05:24,780
what what you know if yeah what the

103
00:05:22,860 --> 00:05:27,270
outcome would be if things go for a bit

104
00:05:24,780 --> 00:05:30,270
too far I think there's been a joking

105
00:05:27,270 --> 00:05:32,820
suggestion that the synopsis of every

106
00:05:30,270 --> 00:05:37,859
episode of Black Mirror is what if

107
00:05:32,820 --> 00:05:43,040
phones bought too much so yeah that kind

108
00:05:37,860 --> 00:05:47,760
of works so yeah I I yeah I signed the

109
00:05:43,040 --> 00:05:49,830
NDA and because I've the actual

110
00:05:47,760 --> 00:05:52,650
production details of this that sources

111
00:05:49,830 --> 00:05:56,070
closely guarded secrets but Sir so he

112
00:05:52,650 --> 00:05:57,960
told me the general gist of things that

113
00:05:56,070 --> 00:06:01,169
this was going to be though doing an

114
00:05:57,960 --> 00:06:03,960
episode about a ZX spectrum games

115
00:06:01,169 --> 00:06:07,560
programmer in the 80s and they wanted

116
00:06:03,960 --> 00:06:10,469
some real-world suspect from programs to

117
00:06:07,560 --> 00:06:13,200
tie into that again I was only really

118
00:06:10,470 --> 00:06:15,780
given that the absolute essential worth

119
00:06:13,200 --> 00:06:18,360
of bits of information about this

120
00:06:15,780 --> 00:06:20,070
episode and one thing attire notably

121
00:06:18,360 --> 00:06:22,530
didn't get told whether the fact that

122
00:06:20,070 --> 00:06:25,110
this was an interactive episode so it's

123
00:06:22,530 --> 00:06:28,080
it's on Netflix and this is one the

124
00:06:25,110 --> 00:06:30,419
gimmick of this episode was that every

125
00:06:28,080 --> 00:06:32,370
now and then it would stop and give you

126
00:06:30,419 --> 00:06:36,120
one of these choices choose the left or

127
00:06:32,370 --> 00:06:38,760
right things and then and then it'd be a

128
00:06:36,120 --> 00:06:42,479
kind of choose your own adventure style

129
00:06:38,760 --> 00:06:44,969
you get to decide the the outcome but I

130
00:06:42,479 --> 00:06:46,459
I did at least find out the

131
00:06:44,969 --> 00:06:49,949
name of the episode which was

132
00:06:46,459 --> 00:06:53,149
Bandersnatch and this is a name that's

133
00:06:49,949 --> 00:06:56,299
particularly significant to suspect from

134
00:06:53,149 --> 00:06:59,519
aficionados because there is this

135
00:06:56,299 --> 00:07:01,649
infamous bit of real world spectrum

136
00:06:59,519 --> 00:07:04,889
vaporware called Bandersnatch back in

137
00:07:01,649 --> 00:07:07,529
1984 this software house imagine they

138
00:07:04,889 --> 00:07:09,479
they decided that they were going to

139
00:07:07,529 --> 00:07:11,339
stand out from the crowd by creating

140
00:07:09,479 --> 00:07:14,128
these so-called mega games that would

141
00:07:11,339 --> 00:07:17,939
have this bit of hardware expansion in

142
00:07:14,129 --> 00:07:21,360
the package that would expand your

143
00:07:17,939 --> 00:07:24,149
spectrums news of unseen unseen

144
00:07:21,360 --> 00:07:26,249
capabilities and I think they just

145
00:07:24,149 --> 00:07:29,039
started buying into their own hype too

146
00:07:26,249 --> 00:07:31,139
much and there's none of the software

147
00:07:29,039 --> 00:07:33,539
distributors had any idea what to make

148
00:07:31,139 --> 00:07:36,149
of this so they they crashed and burned

149
00:07:33,539 --> 00:07:38,248
in spectacular style and and

150
00:07:36,149 --> 00:07:41,659
interestingly it was all the course on

151
00:07:38,249 --> 00:07:44,459
our on video for a BBC documentary that

152
00:07:41,659 --> 00:07:47,459
it was an immense business of glowing

153
00:07:44,459 --> 00:07:50,699
report of this new growing industry of

154
00:07:47,459 --> 00:07:52,309
the the British software industry and

155
00:07:50,699 --> 00:07:54,599
then it they ended up getting a

156
00:07:52,309 --> 00:07:58,889
documentary that went in not quite the

157
00:07:54,599 --> 00:08:01,619
direction they expected and this is

158
00:07:58,889 --> 00:08:04,259
really Charlie broker's bread-and-butter

159
00:08:01,619 --> 00:08:06,959
it seems like he's a bit of a retro

160
00:08:04,259 --> 00:08:11,879
computer nerd he actually started out as

161
00:08:06,959 --> 00:08:15,269
a games journalist and this is actually

162
00:08:11,879 --> 00:08:18,269
a this is a Easter Egg as a black nerd

163
00:08:15,269 --> 00:08:19,860
is very big on this as sort of one ya

164
00:08:18,269 --> 00:08:22,349
blink and you miss it Easter eggs so

165
00:08:19,860 --> 00:08:25,860
this is from a previous episode play

166
00:08:22,349 --> 00:08:27,719
test which has actually mentions while

167
00:08:25,860 --> 00:08:30,689
Cyclops and Bandersnatch which has they

168
00:08:27,719 --> 00:08:34,679
to mega games on the spectrum in the c64

169
00:08:30,689 --> 00:08:37,500
and minor Willie meets the taxman which

170
00:08:34,679 --> 00:08:41,718
is another famous unreleased game on the

171
00:08:37,500 --> 00:08:44,459
spectrum so so you get the sense that

172
00:08:41,719 --> 00:08:46,500
yeah Charlie Brooker who can really

173
00:08:44,459 --> 00:08:49,500
passionate about this though they are

174
00:08:46,500 --> 00:08:51,779
old computers and this then doing an

175
00:08:49,500 --> 00:08:54,420
episode about a spectrum games

176
00:08:51,779 --> 00:08:56,819
programmers was kind of probably a bit

177
00:08:54,420 --> 00:08:58,860
of a passion project for him this is

178
00:08:56,819 --> 00:09:02,370
actually that I discovered

179
00:08:58,860 --> 00:09:05,100
quite recently this radio show in the UK

180
00:09:02,370 --> 00:09:07,080
called Desert Island Discs where they

181
00:09:05,100 --> 00:09:09,149
have invites of celebrities on an

182
00:09:07,080 --> 00:09:12,750
interview them and they they get to

183
00:09:09,149 --> 00:09:15,120
choose their the eight eight songs that

184
00:09:12,750 --> 00:09:18,300
they were to take to listen to on the on

185
00:09:15,120 --> 00:09:21,839
a desert island and one of his choices

186
00:09:18,300 --> 00:09:24,779
was the title music to the gameboy

187
00:09:21,839 --> 00:09:30,060
version of Robocop so yeah he's one of

188
00:09:24,779 --> 00:09:34,170
us so so yeah so I was given the say the

189
00:09:30,060 --> 00:09:37,859
basic outline of of the episode and what

190
00:09:34,170 --> 00:09:41,339
they wanted me to do was related to this

191
00:09:37,860 --> 00:09:43,500
this scene here and where it said well

192
00:09:41,339 --> 00:09:46,320
towards the beginning of the show which

193
00:09:43,500 --> 00:09:50,160
there's this scene where he's going off

194
00:09:46,320 --> 00:09:54,600
to the software house took a soft to

195
00:09:50,160 --> 00:09:58,410
show off these his his work and maybe

196
00:09:54,600 --> 00:10:02,480
he'd get hired there and the there's a

197
00:09:58,410 --> 00:10:06,689
callback to this as a post-credit scene

198
00:10:02,480 --> 00:10:19,800
where rather than of listening to music

199
00:10:06,690 --> 00:10:23,730
on his walkman you get this so you get

200
00:10:19,800 --> 00:10:26,149
this that this this scene where this

201
00:10:23,730 --> 00:10:26,149
happens

202
00:10:26,750 --> 00:10:32,080
[Music]

203
00:10:36,430 --> 00:10:41,469
all right you might want to have to tell

204
00:10:39,280 --> 00:10:44,679
me how to down event yet

205
00:10:41,470 --> 00:10:44,679
[Music]

206
00:10:47,020 --> 00:10:58,130
[Music]

207
00:11:10,720 --> 00:11:21,809
[Music]

208
00:11:46,720 --> 00:11:53,330
so understandably this confused quite a

209
00:11:50,360 --> 00:11:59,770
few viewers who encountered this this

210
00:11:53,330 --> 00:12:02,300
scene here and yes so um the kind of a

211
00:11:59,770 --> 00:12:05,840
it's a quirk of the fact that this was

212
00:12:02,300 --> 00:12:09,680
that this episode was released midnight

213
00:12:05,840 --> 00:12:12,380
somewhere in the u.s. time and so when

214
00:12:09,680 --> 00:12:14,479
the fan forums I read it first

215
00:12:12,380 --> 00:12:16,040
encountered this as I people were not

216
00:12:14,480 --> 00:12:18,680
really sure what to make of this they

217
00:12:16,040 --> 00:12:20,719
said I've heard this these are funny

218
00:12:18,680 --> 00:12:23,479
noises sounds like it might be like slow

219
00:12:20,720 --> 00:12:25,940
skunk TV or something and then it got so

220
00:12:23,480 --> 00:12:28,610
bit of a back-and-forth of people saying

221
00:12:25,940 --> 00:12:30,590
oh you you youngsters you don't don't

222
00:12:28,610 --> 00:12:33,470
you recognize that that's clearly modem

223
00:12:30,590 --> 00:12:36,020
noise okay and nice try it being an old

224
00:12:33,470 --> 00:12:39,230
fart but maybe yeah try a decade earlier

225
00:12:36,020 --> 00:12:43,220
and so yeah this is because it's a

226
00:12:39,230 --> 00:12:44,900
dropped at midnight u.s. time when said

227
00:12:43,220 --> 00:12:47,120
that meant of the the first people who

228
00:12:44,900 --> 00:12:49,310
saw this episode would have been the

229
00:12:47,120 --> 00:12:51,200
people who've stayed up past midnight in

230
00:12:49,310 --> 00:12:53,449
the US and because the spectrum wasn't

231
00:12:51,200 --> 00:12:55,910
really a big thing over there it was a

232
00:12:53,450 --> 00:12:58,760
this was probably a bit baffling there

233
00:12:55,910 --> 00:13:01,610
it was only when when the European

234
00:12:58,760 --> 00:13:04,130
audience woke up and saw it that people

235
00:13:01,610 --> 00:13:04,610
started to figure out what was going on

236
00:13:04,130 --> 00:13:07,520
here

237
00:13:04,610 --> 00:13:11,150
and although when I have mentioned this

238
00:13:07,520 --> 00:13:13,730
fact on on Twitter I did get some angry

239
00:13:11,150 --> 00:13:16,850
Americans saying how dare you I I'll

240
00:13:13,730 --> 00:13:20,030
have you know I know I'm aware of old

241
00:13:16,850 --> 00:13:23,960
computers that use tapes for storage so

242
00:13:20,030 --> 00:13:26,030
okay yeah revised that my statement

243
00:13:23,960 --> 00:13:29,300
there too I think it's the fact that the

244
00:13:26,030 --> 00:13:31,699
the spectrum it was probably the one

245
00:13:29,300 --> 00:13:33,800
platform way you actually routinely

246
00:13:31,700 --> 00:13:36,470
heard that because rather than this

247
00:13:33,800 --> 00:13:38,630
being just something that people who

248
00:13:36,470 --> 00:13:40,190
listen to the tapes for fun would

249
00:13:38,630 --> 00:13:42,410
encounter this is something that you

250
00:13:40,190 --> 00:13:44,840
would routinely hear as you are loading

251
00:13:42,410 --> 00:13:47,449
games and waiting the five minutes for

252
00:13:44,840 --> 00:13:49,880
it to load and instantly I think that

253
00:13:47,450 --> 00:13:52,550
there is a theory that that is actually

254
00:13:49,880 --> 00:13:55,280
a design fault of the spectrum that

255
00:13:52,550 --> 00:13:57,540
really it was just the the loading the

256
00:13:55,280 --> 00:13:59,069
stripe so on the border was what was

257
00:13:57,540 --> 00:14:01,399
then to indicate the fact that it was

258
00:13:59,070 --> 00:14:04,380
loading and it was just the fact that

259
00:14:01,399 --> 00:14:06,149
internally like the the the hardware

260
00:14:04,380 --> 00:14:09,480
port that deals with the border also

261
00:14:06,149 --> 00:14:12,000
deals with the audio speaker as well so

262
00:14:09,480 --> 00:14:14,279
it unintentionally pipes this the

263
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:17,759
screeching sound through through the

264
00:14:14,279 --> 00:14:21,689
spectrum speaker as well but but so yeah

265
00:14:17,759 --> 00:14:25,800
this is it something that the European

266
00:14:21,690 --> 00:14:28,680
audience at least made sense of and so

267
00:14:25,800 --> 00:14:31,769
people learn so got this audio and

268
00:14:28,680 --> 00:14:34,290
started loading it up into the spectrum

269
00:14:31,769 --> 00:14:36,540
and initially the the request that they

270
00:14:34,290 --> 00:14:39,630
came to me with was they just wanted a

271
00:14:36,540 --> 00:14:41,250
program that would print up a QR code

272
00:14:39,630 --> 00:14:44,639
that so when you scanned it it would

273
00:14:41,250 --> 00:14:47,509
take you to a secret website and I I

274
00:14:44,639 --> 00:14:50,430
thought well I yeah I I can do that but

275
00:14:47,509 --> 00:14:52,860
it's really it seems a bit a bit of on

276
00:14:50,430 --> 00:14:54,420
the boring side and given this I've got

277
00:14:52,860 --> 00:14:57,600
this background in doing like visual

278
00:14:54,420 --> 00:15:00,630
effects and things and for a as an

279
00:14:57,600 --> 00:15:02,579
increased furphy I could do er so do

280
00:15:00,630 --> 00:15:05,760
some sort of fancies of glitching

281
00:15:02,579 --> 00:15:07,500
animations and things and so I said I

282
00:15:05,760 --> 00:15:10,860
have to say that that's a spot of

283
00:15:07,500 --> 00:15:16,709
upselling did work on them so and this

284
00:15:10,860 --> 00:15:19,430
is fire up on the emulator what's what

285
00:15:16,709 --> 00:15:19,430
this actually did

286
00:15:30,160 --> 00:15:35,660
so that's a little Coco's quite proud

287
00:15:33,199 --> 00:15:39,229
off usually filenames restricted to ten

288
00:15:35,660 --> 00:15:42,170
characters but the basic key word also

289
00:15:39,230 --> 00:15:44,660
counts as a character so and and out you

290
00:15:42,170 --> 00:15:47,769
can actually spell like Bandersnatch and

291
00:15:44,660 --> 00:15:52,550
say I did this whole thing with the

292
00:15:47,769 --> 00:15:55,100
adding like VHS style glitches and bits

293
00:15:52,550 --> 00:15:57,410
of theories and things and I think I

294
00:15:55,100 --> 00:16:02,569
like to think this enhances the whole

295
00:15:57,410 --> 00:16:10,309
general like mirror ambiance so you go

296
00:16:02,569 --> 00:16:13,550
through a few little tricks there's

297
00:16:10,309 --> 00:16:17,420
quite a bit of looking through YouTube

298
00:16:13,550 --> 00:16:21,378
clips of a VHS noise that people created

299
00:16:17,420 --> 00:16:24,290
and it's it wouldn't be things it's kind

300
00:16:21,379 --> 00:16:26,329
of lightly they hole my ass one on the

301
00:16:24,290 --> 00:16:28,040
surface is just a very graceful but it's

302
00:16:26,329 --> 00:16:31,219
fluffing like that and these things that

303
00:16:28,040 --> 00:16:34,069
they look like it's just oh I just yeah

304
00:16:31,220 --> 00:16:34,939
corrupted a few bites and it's behaving

305
00:16:34,069 --> 00:16:38,990
a bit weirdly

306
00:16:34,939 --> 00:16:42,589
so you get but instead there's a lot of

307
00:16:38,990 --> 00:16:46,089
trickery going into it so things like

308
00:16:42,589 --> 00:16:48,439
the the little ripple that you get just

309
00:16:46,089 --> 00:16:51,079
at the base there that's actually

310
00:16:48,439 --> 00:16:52,939
storing like eight different copies of

311
00:16:51,079 --> 00:16:56,300
the QR code and like picking the right

312
00:16:52,939 --> 00:16:59,120
one for each line and conversely I think

313
00:16:56,300 --> 00:17:01,639
there's also bits that are like this bit

314
00:16:59,120 --> 00:17:03,730
here which looks the fancier than it

315
00:17:01,639 --> 00:17:07,189
actually is that's just really saying

316
00:17:03,730 --> 00:17:09,799
okay instead of drawing this as a twenty

317
00:17:07,189 --> 00:17:13,399
character wide sprite pretend it's 21

318
00:17:09,799 --> 00:17:17,148
characters wide and then the the effect

319
00:17:13,398 --> 00:17:19,250
of the of the weird screen layout on the

320
00:17:17,148 --> 00:17:31,489
spectrum means it just ends up witching

321
00:17:19,250 --> 00:17:34,990
out in that particular way that in so

322
00:17:31,490 --> 00:17:39,919
that as I said the first assignment as

323
00:17:34,990 --> 00:17:42,049
and where it was to create that QR code

324
00:17:39,919 --> 00:17:45,019
and I think they they gave me a lot of

325
00:17:42,049 --> 00:17:47,269
I think the only real of constraint was

326
00:17:45,019 --> 00:17:50,059
that or whatever you do it absolutely

327
00:17:47,269 --> 00:17:52,429
has to come in at 60 seconds it can't be

328
00:17:50,059 --> 00:17:59,918
any longer than that and yeah no problem

329
00:17:52,429 --> 00:18:02,590
so yeah this and so having done the they

330
00:17:59,919 --> 00:18:06,649
this program to bring you to the website

331
00:18:02,590 --> 00:18:08,149
this secret website they the next step

332
00:18:06,649 --> 00:18:11,059
was obviously obviously to have some

333
00:18:08,149 --> 00:18:15,109
content on the website and that's a came

334
00:18:11,059 --> 00:18:19,158
in the form of so I was tasked with

335
00:18:15,109 --> 00:18:23,809
creating a actual spectrum version of

336
00:18:19,159 --> 00:18:25,399
one of the games that appears in the

337
00:18:23,809 --> 00:18:28,549
show so I'll uh

338
00:18:25,399 --> 00:18:35,469
I'll show you the particular clip where

339
00:18:28,549 --> 00:18:35,470
this comes up my taps around again

340
00:18:48,450 --> 00:18:52,020
that's not good

341
00:18:52,710 --> 00:19:05,850
beach ball of Dhoom again

342
00:19:12,840 --> 00:19:34,949
called nosedive smooth I'm doing so the

343
00:19:32,309 --> 00:19:38,250
the the games that everything that you

344
00:19:34,950 --> 00:19:40,350
see on the spectrum screens in the in in

345
00:19:38,250 --> 00:19:42,750
the show itself was actually all done

346
00:19:40,350 --> 00:19:45,418
that before I was brought on board I

347
00:19:42,750 --> 00:19:49,320
this is all done this kind of video just

348
00:19:45,419 --> 00:19:53,490
yeah I'm done in by an Adobe Premiere or

349
00:19:49,320 --> 00:19:56,700
whatever the tool of choice was and it

350
00:19:53,490 --> 00:20:00,029
it I think has to be said that they did

351
00:19:56,700 --> 00:20:02,100
a pretty good job of recreating those

352
00:20:00,029 --> 00:20:05,789
spectrum quirks considering this is

353
00:20:02,100 --> 00:20:07,469
entirely sort of faked like a the

354
00:20:05,789 --> 00:20:10,440
spectrum has this a famous quirk of

355
00:20:07,470 --> 00:20:14,789
color clash where because you can only

356
00:20:10,440 --> 00:20:16,649
have em within each of 8x8 pixel square

357
00:20:14,789 --> 00:20:18,960
you can only have two colors as I've

358
00:20:16,649 --> 00:20:21,570
foreground in the background so if you

359
00:20:18,960 --> 00:20:23,460
have several tough sprites moving on top

360
00:20:21,570 --> 00:20:26,820
of each other it has to pick one color

361
00:20:23,460 --> 00:20:29,340
so they dutifully faked all of this

362
00:20:26,820 --> 00:20:31,710
stuff in the in there a video editing

363
00:20:29,340 --> 00:20:33,629
package so you can see at this point

364
00:20:31,710 --> 00:20:37,169
where ease of crashing into one of the

365
00:20:33,630 --> 00:20:39,539
the eyeballs it's it's turning him green

366
00:20:37,169 --> 00:20:43,110
as well and as that that one is going

367
00:20:39,539 --> 00:20:46,320
above the the high score a text that's

368
00:20:43,110 --> 00:20:48,689
of changing as well so didn't really yes

369
00:20:46,320 --> 00:20:51,029
a decent job of this and there's just a

370
00:20:48,690 --> 00:20:54,659
couple of of it little annoyances like

371
00:20:51,029 --> 00:20:56,700
the little yellow details on the on the

372
00:20:54,659 --> 00:20:58,679
walls which you can't really do because

373
00:20:56,700 --> 00:21:01,020
you've got the yellow bit too close to

374
00:20:58,679 --> 00:21:03,149
the purple and the and the red and the

375
00:21:01,020 --> 00:21:04,649
and also the fact he's got a blue hat

376
00:21:03,149 --> 00:21:07,500
that would not have happened in a real

377
00:21:04,649 --> 00:21:10,979
spectrum game so had to adapt things

378
00:21:07,500 --> 00:21:13,260
slightly but but other thing is they've

379
00:21:10,980 --> 00:21:15,990
done a really good job of this and that

380
00:21:13,260 --> 00:21:19,020
really have made my my job a lot easier

381
00:21:15,990 --> 00:21:21,270
of creating a version of this game

382
00:21:19,020 --> 00:21:25,950
because pretty much all the the design

383
00:21:21,270 --> 00:21:26,670
was done for me and as a couple of

384
00:21:25,950 --> 00:21:31,890
different

385
00:21:26,670 --> 00:21:34,620
games that get that appear in the in the

386
00:21:31,890 --> 00:21:37,850
show and they showed me these clips of

387
00:21:34,620 --> 00:21:40,620
all of them this the really nice one was

388
00:21:37,850 --> 00:21:44,100
metal head which is shown right this is

389
00:21:40,620 --> 00:21:48,270
superbly the star programmers previous

390
00:21:44,100 --> 00:21:50,879
hit and it's also a reference to a

391
00:21:48,270 --> 00:21:52,950
previous episode of black mare earth

392
00:21:50,880 --> 00:21:55,230
although they're in their Easter eggs

393
00:21:52,950 --> 00:21:57,390
and it just it does look really lovely

394
00:21:55,230 --> 00:21:59,070
all this parallax scrolling and I I

395
00:21:57,390 --> 00:22:02,520
would have loved to actually make this

396
00:21:59,070 --> 00:22:04,350
game but I just thought well I'm not

397
00:22:02,520 --> 00:22:06,090
sure have actually seen a real spectrum

398
00:22:04,350 --> 00:22:09,418
game do that it's kind of level of

399
00:22:06,090 --> 00:22:11,280
scrolling so I didn't think I could

400
00:22:09,419 --> 00:22:12,840
really risk so saying sure I'll have a

401
00:22:11,280 --> 00:22:14,399
go at that and then having to come back

402
00:22:12,840 --> 00:22:18,320
to them a month later saying oh actually

403
00:22:14,400 --> 00:22:23,100
now no that's impossible and they also

404
00:22:18,320 --> 00:22:26,639
gave me the clips of of the Bandersnatch

405
00:22:23,100 --> 00:22:31,020
itself the the game that this episode is

406
00:22:26,640 --> 00:22:33,419
all about and but I didn't really get

407
00:22:31,020 --> 00:22:36,510
any context in of what these things

408
00:22:33,419 --> 00:22:42,960
actually meant so I kind of missed out

409
00:22:36,510 --> 00:22:44,700
on the detail that that with that as you

410
00:22:42,960 --> 00:22:47,549
actually progress through this game then

411
00:22:44,700 --> 00:22:49,830
and use of encounter the enemies then it

412
00:22:47,549 --> 00:22:51,570
will give you the the little choice bars

413
00:22:49,830 --> 00:22:54,240
that mirror what happens in the actual

414
00:22:51,570 --> 00:22:56,879
episode so I didn't get any of this

415
00:22:54,240 --> 00:22:58,679
nuance I just thought okay that's it's

416
00:22:56,880 --> 00:23:01,290
some sort of maze game and it's got

417
00:22:58,679 --> 00:23:04,530
enemies oh okay okay I can I guess I can

418
00:23:01,290 --> 00:23:08,450
do something that fits that but yeah if

419
00:23:04,530 --> 00:23:11,879
I if I'd known at this point there what

420
00:23:08,450 --> 00:23:13,650
what this game actually calls for in the

421
00:23:11,880 --> 00:23:15,780
plot of the episode it would have been

422
00:23:13,650 --> 00:23:19,380
no no I'm not touching that with a

423
00:23:15,780 --> 00:23:19,860
bargepole but luckily they they didn't

424
00:23:19,380 --> 00:23:22,640
go for that

425
00:23:19,860 --> 00:23:27,178
well that one in the end so they just

426
00:23:22,640 --> 00:23:31,049
went for creating this the nose-dive

427
00:23:27,179 --> 00:23:35,990
game so just quickly get that one up

428
00:23:31,049 --> 00:23:39,400
I'll spare the slow tape loading process

429
00:23:35,990 --> 00:23:39,400
[Music]

430
00:23:39,480 --> 00:23:47,230
so yeah hopefully others can bearly to

431
00:23:43,809 --> 00:23:50,590
the is in the show

432
00:23:47,230 --> 00:23:53,429
the only real worth of decision i beyond

433
00:23:50,590 --> 00:23:56,379
what's in the video is healthier how the

434
00:23:53,429 --> 00:23:59,440
controls work so i decided to try and go

435
00:23:56,379 --> 00:24:02,350
for this whole flappy bird thing of

436
00:23:59,440 --> 00:24:05,499
making the control that they the

437
00:24:02,350 --> 00:24:08,559
keyboard controls a bit quirky in hard

438
00:24:05,499 --> 00:24:10,659
to get get to grips with so if you don't

439
00:24:08,559 --> 00:24:16,600
press any key it will sort of drift left

440
00:24:10,659 --> 00:24:18,879
and right say oh i think my high score

441
00:24:16,600 --> 00:24:20,918
in this game is pretty good cuz i I had

442
00:24:18,879 --> 00:24:22,988
to earth to do all the testing to make

443
00:24:20,919 --> 00:24:26,529
sure that the score older rolled them

444
00:24:22,989 --> 00:24:28,600
over into the thousands but although I

445
00:24:26,529 --> 00:24:30,369
think that might have been on earth of a

446
00:24:28,600 --> 00:24:33,428
version of the game before I tweaked the

447
00:24:30,369 --> 00:24:37,119
difficulty a bit but yeah that's managed

448
00:24:33,429 --> 00:24:38,470
to infuriate quite a lot of people so

449
00:24:37,119 --> 00:24:44,649
yeah mission accomplished

450
00:24:38,470 --> 00:24:47,980
and yeah so considering that the all the

451
00:24:44,649 --> 00:24:50,830
games and the the code that you see in

452
00:24:47,980 --> 00:24:54,519
as part of the the program as part of

453
00:24:50,830 --> 00:24:56,559
the show itself was done to did by the

454
00:24:54,519 --> 00:24:59,350
production team I had nothing to do with

455
00:24:56,559 --> 00:25:02,259
this and so in some respects of this

456
00:24:59,350 --> 00:25:04,899
it's a bit inauthentic so you get these

457
00:25:02,259 --> 00:25:07,059
if freeze frames where you can see the

458
00:25:04,899 --> 00:25:08,830
code they've written and yeah it's it's

459
00:25:07,059 --> 00:25:11,230
written in basic which definitely would

460
00:25:08,830 --> 00:25:15,129
not be the case for a game back in the

461
00:25:11,230 --> 00:25:17,649
day but relative to your typical movie

462
00:25:15,129 --> 00:25:19,959
hacking scenes after that they did a

463
00:25:17,649 --> 00:25:21,699
pretty good job because yeah it wouldn't

464
00:25:19,960 --> 00:25:23,889
be in basic but this is actually a

465
00:25:21,700 --> 00:25:26,139
genuine dead expect from basic listing

466
00:25:23,889 --> 00:25:28,508
and I think if you type this listing in

467
00:25:26,139 --> 00:25:30,580
you actually do get something it is a

468
00:25:28,509 --> 00:25:32,710
vague approximation to the actual game

469
00:25:30,580 --> 00:25:35,470
you get the the eyeballs actually

470
00:25:32,710 --> 00:25:39,399
scrolling up the screen the character at

471
00:25:35,470 --> 00:25:41,009
the time so yeah I think I have to take

472
00:25:39,399 --> 00:25:44,428
my hats off to them and I think that was

473
00:25:41,009 --> 00:25:47,679
the influence of Charlie Brooker again I

474
00:25:44,429 --> 00:25:50,349
saw this his interview with the wired

475
00:25:47,679 --> 00:25:51,049
that they did where it sounds like he

476
00:25:50,349 --> 00:25:52,789
was kind of

477
00:25:51,049 --> 00:25:55,580
acting the role of the the ped and

478
00:25:52,789 --> 00:25:57,080
throughout this whole process like yeah

479
00:25:55,580 --> 00:25:59,000
it's the number of conversations who

480
00:25:57,080 --> 00:26:00,710
 had effects spectrum games and

481
00:25:59,000 --> 00:26:02,090
the standard spectrum mates and it

482
00:26:00,710 --> 00:26:04,539
wouldn't make a sound like that if

483
00:26:02,090 --> 00:26:06,559
you're pressing that button there so

484
00:26:04,539 --> 00:26:08,539
having gone through all this sort of

485
00:26:06,559 --> 00:26:10,370
internal nitpicking of they oh that

486
00:26:08,539 --> 00:26:13,210
color flash isn't quite right and now

487
00:26:10,370 --> 00:26:16,820
feel hearing that Charlie Brooker was

488
00:26:13,210 --> 00:26:20,690
just the same that that is that did make

489
00:26:16,820 --> 00:26:25,129
me rather happy obviously the process of

490
00:26:20,690 --> 00:26:28,070
creating this on in in so 2018 is very

491
00:26:25,130 --> 00:26:31,460
different to the enduring the the rubber

492
00:26:28,070 --> 00:26:34,100
keyboard if they like they would have

493
00:26:31,460 --> 00:26:37,610
done back in the day I was workings of

494
00:26:34,100 --> 00:26:40,879
entirely on emulators and cross

495
00:26:37,610 --> 00:26:43,520
compiling we've got command-line tools

496
00:26:40,880 --> 00:26:45,799
so it's just just like a single line

497
00:26:43,520 --> 00:26:48,980
command that would take all the graphic

498
00:26:45,799 --> 00:26:53,179
assets and and package that up into the

499
00:26:48,980 --> 00:26:55,820
executive ball and incidentally have the

500
00:26:53,179 --> 00:26:58,340
making the sprites really smooth as as

501
00:26:55,820 --> 00:27:01,570
as he says in the episode was actually

502
00:26:58,340 --> 00:27:04,520
the the bit that took some doing and and

503
00:27:01,570 --> 00:27:06,799
it's the thing about the the spectrum is

504
00:27:04,520 --> 00:27:10,039
that you don't really have enough

505
00:27:06,799 --> 00:27:12,260
processor time to create the whole next

506
00:27:10,039 --> 00:27:14,480
frame of animation in a back buffer and

507
00:27:12,260 --> 00:27:17,480
then push it all to the screen in one go

508
00:27:14,480 --> 00:27:19,880
so when you're to clearing and redrawing

509
00:27:17,480 --> 00:27:22,250
sprites you've got to keep track you got

510
00:27:19,880 --> 00:27:23,840
to be aware of the fact that if you're

511
00:27:22,250 --> 00:27:27,590
doing if you're clearing the sprite

512
00:27:23,840 --> 00:27:30,199
while they refer it the Refresh of the

513
00:27:27,590 --> 00:27:31,850
screen reaches that point then you're

514
00:27:30,200 --> 00:27:35,480
going to get a bit a flicker there and

515
00:27:31,850 --> 00:27:37,879
and so I determined not to make that

516
00:27:35,480 --> 00:27:39,799
happen and say I hadn't actually seen

517
00:27:37,880 --> 00:27:41,990
that scene that the scene of him saying

518
00:27:39,799 --> 00:27:43,220
yeah the sprites are really smooth but

519
00:27:41,990 --> 00:27:45,669
at the point that I did this but

520
00:27:43,220 --> 00:27:49,549
something I think worked out that way so

521
00:27:45,669 --> 00:27:52,460
yeah I ended up doing the various fancy

522
00:27:49,549 --> 00:27:54,529
sprite routines that did the clearing

523
00:27:52,460 --> 00:27:57,169
and redrawing at the same point and then

524
00:27:54,529 --> 00:27:58,970
having to have about four or five

525
00:27:57,169 --> 00:28:01,490
different copies of this routine for all

526
00:27:58,970 --> 00:28:03,440
the different sprite widths so lots of

527
00:28:01,490 --> 00:28:04,370
fast but yeah definitely worth the

528
00:28:03,440 --> 00:28:07,350
effort

529
00:28:04,370 --> 00:28:10,860
but say yeah I didn't really know the

530
00:28:07,350 --> 00:28:12,360
context of how where these would fit

531
00:28:10,860 --> 00:28:14,969
into from the episode all I had to

532
00:28:12,360 --> 00:28:18,330
really go on was these twenty second

533
00:28:14,970 --> 00:28:21,059
clips of the the the gameplay itself so

534
00:28:18,330 --> 00:28:24,240
when the show did finally get released I

535
00:28:21,059 --> 00:28:27,149
kind of got the the reveals in the back

536
00:28:24,240 --> 00:28:30,480
to front order so this is like one of

537
00:28:27,149 --> 00:28:32,699
the graphic assets that they sent over

538
00:28:30,480 --> 00:28:34,980
was that so as the the main sprite

539
00:28:32,700 --> 00:28:39,090
you'll notice that it has the file name

540
00:28:34,980 --> 00:28:40,559
: 0 0 1 and I thought okay Colin that's

541
00:28:39,090 --> 00:28:43,470
just the name of the character in the

542
00:28:40,559 --> 00:28:47,158
game and I didn't realize that the Colin

543
00:28:43,470 --> 00:28:49,110
is in fact of the in in the episode that

544
00:28:47,159 --> 00:28:52,620
the name for the programmer who made

545
00:28:49,110 --> 00:28:56,309
this game and this obviously being the

546
00:28:52,620 --> 00:28:59,100
the the episode is all abouts of

547
00:28:56,309 --> 00:29:00,750
breaking the fourth wall and so that

548
00:28:59,100 --> 00:29:03,418
that means that logically Colin is

549
00:29:00,750 --> 00:29:07,470
actually me and then the game is

550
00:29:03,419 --> 00:29:10,080
actually foreshadowings of this yeah him

551
00:29:07,470 --> 00:29:14,669
taking a leaf off a building himself so

552
00:29:10,080 --> 00:29:17,908
logically that means that I'm yep so

553
00:29:14,669 --> 00:29:20,429
yeah meanwhile there's an ending where

554
00:29:17,909 --> 00:29:22,080
where where Stefan Lee the other

555
00:29:20,429 --> 00:29:24,539
programmer cracks from the stress of

556
00:29:22,080 --> 00:29:26,699
making the game and starts killing the

557
00:29:24,539 --> 00:29:29,490
people who are checking up on him and as

558
00:29:26,700 --> 00:29:32,460
it happens I was like a week or two late

559
00:29:29,490 --> 00:29:35,580
delivering this so I think I can only

560
00:29:32,460 --> 00:29:37,169
imagine one oh so when Russell the

561
00:29:35,580 --> 00:29:39,299
producers email me how's it doing oh I

562
00:29:37,169 --> 00:29:41,370
just need a couple more days I don't

563
00:29:39,299 --> 00:29:43,799
know what he thought I was up to so it's

564
00:29:41,370 --> 00:29:46,229
they're saying the stuff there he must

565
00:29:43,799 --> 00:29:55,710
have been rather more stressed than I

566
00:29:46,230 --> 00:29:58,289
was yeah so on the subject of Easter

567
00:29:55,710 --> 00:30:01,919
eggs I haven't really have realised to

568
00:29:58,289 --> 00:30:04,049
what extent the how fervent the like

569
00:30:01,919 --> 00:30:07,529
marathons were it's of seeking out these

570
00:30:04,049 --> 00:30:09,929
Easter eggs and I think this whole

571
00:30:07,529 --> 00:30:12,149
project were that I was involved in was

572
00:30:09,929 --> 00:30:16,169
basically as one hell of an elaborate

573
00:30:12,149 --> 00:30:18,120
Easter Egg and and it got all figured a

574
00:30:16,169 --> 00:30:20,550
within 24 hours

575
00:30:18,120 --> 00:30:22,800
but and I think there was this sense of

576
00:30:20,550 --> 00:30:24,629
well if the rabbit hole is gone this far

577
00:30:22,800 --> 00:30:25,080
there surely must be some more to it

578
00:30:24,630 --> 00:30:28,020
than that

579
00:30:25,080 --> 00:30:29,730
and in in particular I think there a lot

580
00:30:28,020 --> 00:30:33,210
of people hung up on the fact that at

581
00:30:29,730 --> 00:30:35,850
one point in the in the in the show he

582
00:30:33,210 --> 00:30:39,060
has to have dial like a number to call

583
00:30:35,850 --> 00:30:40,980
this therapist and it's and they're

584
00:30:39,060 --> 00:30:42,570
thinking oh surely there's that there

585
00:30:40,980 --> 00:30:46,200
must be other numbers that you can type

586
00:30:42,570 --> 00:30:48,300
in to reveal the secrets and wait but

587
00:30:46,200 --> 00:30:50,550
wait a minute the the score at the score

588
00:30:48,300 --> 00:30:53,159
of this game it's a five digit number so

589
00:30:50,550 --> 00:30:55,620
there must be something to do with if I

590
00:30:53,160 --> 00:30:58,530
score a particular amount in this game

591
00:30:55,620 --> 00:31:00,330
then something will happen and so if

592
00:30:58,530 --> 00:31:02,820
there are people just trying to get up

593
00:31:00,330 --> 00:31:07,439
to seven nine nine nine nine zero with

594
00:31:02,820 --> 00:31:10,320
with cheats and and I think given that

595
00:31:07,440 --> 00:31:12,120
the whole production of the game was

596
00:31:10,320 --> 00:31:15,450
kind of so late in the production

597
00:31:12,120 --> 00:31:18,719
process I think the idea that they would

598
00:31:15,450 --> 00:31:20,550
have somehow engineered an Easter egg in

599
00:31:18,720 --> 00:31:22,470
the game that would then feed back into

600
00:31:20,550 --> 00:31:28,500
the show itself I think that would Vince

601
00:31:22,470 --> 00:31:32,820
also next level and genius master plan

602
00:31:28,500 --> 00:31:36,090
thing so say yeah fraid that say if

603
00:31:32,820 --> 00:31:40,460
there are any Easter eggs at that level

604
00:31:36,090 --> 00:31:43,709
then I'm not involved in them but I did

605
00:31:40,460 --> 00:31:46,620
inadvertently fuel a bit more Easter Egg

606
00:31:43,710 --> 00:31:49,260
speculation because at the point where I

607
00:31:46,620 --> 00:31:52,020
did the the QR code I wasn't actually

608
00:31:49,260 --> 00:31:54,720
sure if if I would was going to get a

609
00:31:52,020 --> 00:31:58,020
credit of my own in in either in the

610
00:31:54,720 --> 00:31:59,430
show or otherwise so and it wasn't so

611
00:31:58,020 --> 00:32:01,980
confirmed that I would be actually

612
00:31:59,430 --> 00:32:04,860
working on the on the game itself at

613
00:32:01,980 --> 00:32:08,540
that point the QR code bit had priority

614
00:32:04,860 --> 00:32:11,070
because that was forming part of the the

615
00:32:08,540 --> 00:32:13,860
episode itself and they had sort of get

616
00:32:11,070 --> 00:32:17,250
that into the sound into the the sound

617
00:32:13,860 --> 00:32:19,919
mix that then got sent off to Netflix so

618
00:32:17,250 --> 00:32:24,950
there's a kind of an insurance policy so

619
00:32:19,920 --> 00:32:27,120
that when I was at and yeah well

620
00:32:24,950 --> 00:32:28,650
occasions like this where I becoming I'm

621
00:32:27,120 --> 00:32:30,330
saying yes this is the thing I did I

622
00:32:28,650 --> 00:32:31,380
needed to be able to prove that it was

623
00:32:30,330 --> 00:32:34,799
me and

624
00:32:31,380 --> 00:32:37,830
I wasn't really sure well well yeah

625
00:32:34,799 --> 00:32:39,179
whether I'd be able to so what what I

626
00:32:37,830 --> 00:32:41,250
could get away with putting in two

627
00:32:39,179 --> 00:32:43,980
secret credits without breaking

628
00:32:41,250 --> 00:32:46,080
immersion because yeah maybe it's a

629
00:32:43,980 --> 00:32:49,200
essential but it all stays in universe

630
00:32:46,080 --> 00:32:52,409
so I decided that the best way to to go

631
00:32:49,200 --> 00:32:54,750
about that was I said how did this says

632
00:32:52,410 --> 00:32:58,200
this little message in the the binary of

633
00:32:54,750 --> 00:33:00,809
the QR code program saying sift bigger

634
00:32:58,200 --> 00:33:02,280
digger bigger B which those who are

635
00:33:00,809 --> 00:33:06,260
paying attention last night will

636
00:33:02,280 --> 00:33:08,730
remember the and they I played that

637
00:33:06,260 --> 00:33:10,408
sandstorm by darude with the bigger

638
00:33:08,730 --> 00:33:13,500
digger bigger B lyrics and I thought

639
00:33:10,409 --> 00:33:16,679
okay this is a Vista phrase that's that

640
00:33:13,500 --> 00:33:19,760
related to me and but is not google-able

641
00:33:16,679 --> 00:33:23,190
at this point so I think that's probably

642
00:33:19,760 --> 00:33:25,650
avoiding sort of leaking my identity out

643
00:33:23,190 --> 00:33:28,470
to anyone who's not in than in the note

644
00:33:25,650 --> 00:33:30,510
but obviously the Easter egg hunters has

645
00:33:28,470 --> 00:33:32,820
then discovered this and there was wild

646
00:33:30,510 --> 00:33:35,090
speculation of oh it must be this

647
00:33:32,820 --> 00:33:39,689
episode to this other episode that had

648
00:33:35,090 --> 00:33:42,510
mechanical bees in it and so so yeah I

649
00:33:39,690 --> 00:33:48,570
think I led people up the garden path on

650
00:33:42,510 --> 00:33:49,770
that one so yeah that's kind of about at

651
00:33:48,570 --> 00:33:53,490
the end of my story I think there was

652
00:33:49,770 --> 00:33:56,908
one just epilogue which is the last bit

653
00:33:53,490 --> 00:33:58,890
of life in this thing which is that just

654
00:33:56,909 --> 00:34:02,520
after the episode was aired there's

655
00:33:58,890 --> 00:34:04,740
these pop-up shops around the UK I think

656
00:34:02,520 --> 00:34:06,840
there's one to have in London around old

657
00:34:04,740 --> 00:34:07,799
Street and one in Birmingham New Street

658
00:34:06,840 --> 00:34:11,850
Station

659
00:34:07,799 --> 00:34:16,739
these took a soft branded news agents

660
00:34:11,850 --> 00:34:19,080
and there was this signing event that

661
00:34:16,739 --> 00:34:24,149
happened in the London one and they had

662
00:34:19,080 --> 00:34:27,090
my game being played in the in in the

663
00:34:24,149 --> 00:34:29,699
background there so unfortunately I

664
00:34:27,090 --> 00:34:31,470
didn't I've did all of this entirely

665
00:34:29,699 --> 00:34:33,719
remotely so I didn't really get source

666
00:34:31,469 --> 00:34:36,480
of meat so Charlie Brooker or any of the

667
00:34:33,719 --> 00:34:38,339
the cast but at least that I can now

668
00:34:36,480 --> 00:34:40,770
conceal myself with the fact that my

669
00:34:38,340 --> 00:34:41,690
game has been in the presence of Charlie

670
00:34:40,770 --> 00:34:46,040
Brooker so

671
00:34:41,690 --> 00:34:48,339
I think that's that's a success thanks

672
00:34:46,040 --> 00:34:48,339
very much

673
00:34:52,270 --> 00:34:55,810
any questions

674
00:35:07,030 --> 00:35:11,240
hello yeah um I seem to remember one

675
00:35:10,400 --> 00:35:12,950
point you mentioned there might have

676
00:35:11,240 --> 00:35:14,598
been something else was there or was

677
00:35:12,950 --> 00:35:17,480
that just you leaving us at the garden

678
00:35:14,599 --> 00:35:20,150
path what I said was truthful I don't

679
00:35:17,480 --> 00:35:23,480
really want to get anyone's hopes up but

680
00:35:20,150 --> 00:35:25,190
there was yes idea that I didn't

681
00:35:23,480 --> 00:35:27,200
certainly didn't do anything on the

682
00:35:25,190 --> 00:35:29,930
scale though fight another game that I'm

683
00:35:27,200 --> 00:35:33,140
not telling anyone about but yeah the

684
00:35:29,930 --> 00:35:36,109
was kind of another bit of material

685
00:35:33,140 --> 00:35:38,868
related to this that they asked for I'm

686
00:35:36,109 --> 00:35:41,390
obviously being so vague in case this is

687
00:35:38,869 --> 00:35:42,920
kind of the one remaining bit of insider

688
00:35:41,390 --> 00:35:46,190
information that I'm not allowed to

689
00:35:42,920 --> 00:35:48,260
reveal yet but yeah I don't know if

690
00:35:46,190 --> 00:35:50,990
they've have made use of this or whether

691
00:35:48,260 --> 00:35:55,040
this was kind of an idea that didn't

692
00:35:50,990 --> 00:35:58,479
come to pass but yeah hold on I'll just

693
00:35:55,040 --> 00:35:58,480
have the way then I guess yeah

694
00:36:08,059 --> 00:36:11,930
okay okay so thank you

695
00:36:12,400 --> 00:36:17,439
[Applause]
