1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
down in the room Echo would do two talks

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:06,180
back to back the first one is about uh

3
00:00:06,180 --> 00:00:08,639
yeah it's dutch bus firing basic

4
00:00:08,639 --> 00:00:11,340
security and uh elkha please take it

5
00:00:11,340 --> 00:00:15,259
away give it up for Elgar

6
00:00:16,800 --> 00:00:18,600
thank you very much for having me

7
00:00:18,600 --> 00:00:19,920
Dimitri

8
00:00:19,920 --> 00:00:21,420
um I've been looking forward to this

9
00:00:21,420 --> 00:00:22,199
talk

10
00:00:22,199 --> 00:00:24,060
um there's some special news that I want

11
00:00:24,060 --> 00:00:25,560
to share

12
00:00:25,560 --> 00:00:28,859
um so it will be a short talk talk

13
00:00:28,859 --> 00:00:32,159
um and I try to do it in like 15 minutes

14
00:00:32,159 --> 00:00:34,559
or something like 20 minutes so let's

15
00:00:34,559 --> 00:00:37,020
see how far we get uh naming and shaming

16
00:00:37,020 --> 00:00:39,960
security because it works that's what we

17
00:00:39,960 --> 00:00:40,800
do

18
00:00:40,800 --> 00:00:44,840
um first hello it's me Elgar Stitch

19
00:00:44,840 --> 00:00:48,980
and I do things for MCH

20
00:00:48,980 --> 00:00:51,960
have helped with founding hack 42

21
00:00:51,960 --> 00:00:54,840
hackerspace and rnm they are building

22
00:00:54,840 --> 00:00:56,520
their own space now they bought a

23
00:00:56,520 --> 00:00:59,000
building and they have their own space

24
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:01,980
Retro Gaming organization in the past I

25
00:01:01,980 --> 00:01:05,099
did that awesome retro and the awesome

26
00:01:05,099 --> 00:01:07,260
space in Utrecht and that's especially

27
00:01:07,260 --> 00:01:09,479
at another one of the the things that I

28
00:01:09,479 --> 00:01:12,180
do is the internet cleanup Foundation we

29
00:01:12,180 --> 00:01:15,180
started this in 2016 with a few friends

30
00:01:15,180 --> 00:01:16,740
currently

31
00:01:16,740 --> 00:01:20,479
it's Johan Bloomberg who's in the back

32
00:01:20,479 --> 00:01:24,180
John and I develop for this platform a

33
00:01:24,180 --> 00:01:27,020
lot Tron is a treasure of the foundation

34
00:01:27,020 --> 00:01:30,240
and I'm the chair

35
00:01:30,240 --> 00:01:33,140
um so we started in 2016 with a very

36
00:01:33,140 --> 00:01:35,820
non-provocative name falcard fill your

37
00:01:35,820 --> 00:01:39,000
map it's just basically like a big

38
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:41,340
you too you're not doing it right and

39
00:01:41,340 --> 00:01:45,540
that was a nice introduction in security

40
00:01:45,540 --> 00:01:48,780
for the Target organizations which were

41
00:01:48,780 --> 00:01:52,920
governments so it was a way to yeah get

42
00:01:52,920 --> 00:01:56,700
them moving and it worked because

43
00:01:56,700 --> 00:01:57,259
um

44
00:01:57,259 --> 00:02:00,600
we saw like we probably you will see the

45
00:02:00,600 --> 00:02:03,119
interface soon we publish

46
00:02:03,119 --> 00:02:03,840
um

47
00:02:03,840 --> 00:02:06,899
a very low tier security issues like

48
00:02:06,899 --> 00:02:09,959
kindergarten security you can call it if

49
00:02:09,959 --> 00:02:12,180
you cannot do that right you basically

50
00:02:12,180 --> 00:02:13,379
cannot do anything

51
00:02:13,379 --> 00:02:15,599
right so there's not a lot of

52
00:02:15,599 --> 00:02:16,920
organizations that do it right probably

53
00:02:16,920 --> 00:02:19,020
we will do something wrong as well it's

54
00:02:19,020 --> 00:02:21,000
always nice to like yeah you're doing it

55
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:23,540
wrong as well yes I am sorry

56
00:02:23,540 --> 00:02:26,700
but we changed the name became a little

57
00:02:26,700 --> 00:02:29,239
bit more friendly it's now

58
00:02:29,239 --> 00:02:32,700
Baseline security and we basically

59
00:02:32,700 --> 00:02:35,120
monitor the entire government for

60
00:02:35,120 --> 00:02:38,220
kindergarten security so all

61
00:02:38,220 --> 00:02:40,680
municipalities we do a semi-government

62
00:02:40,680 --> 00:02:44,940
like healthcare hospitals provinces the

63
00:02:44,940 --> 00:02:49,620
entire like uh yeah overhead

64
00:02:49,739 --> 00:02:52,440
and you we gave them colors if they do

65
00:02:52,440 --> 00:02:54,480
it right and they do everything right

66
00:02:54,480 --> 00:02:56,640
they get a green color

67
00:02:56,640 --> 00:02:59,459
and if they have like one issue like

68
00:02:59,459 --> 00:03:01,980
they expose a version information of say

69
00:03:01,980 --> 00:03:04,140
or they have TLS that's broken or they

70
00:03:04,140 --> 00:03:07,739
are missing TLS or they have other small

71
00:03:07,739 --> 00:03:11,659
issues then they can get orange or red

72
00:03:11,659 --> 00:03:15,599
and so you see it's a lot it's a lot of

73
00:03:15,599 --> 00:03:18,599
red that happens because every time the

74
00:03:18,599 --> 00:03:20,940
map starts coming green which we have

75
00:03:20,940 --> 00:03:26,400
seen for a few Cycles now we add more so

76
00:03:26,700 --> 00:03:29,819
so they love us for it so we recently

77
00:03:29,819 --> 00:03:31,680
added the new editions from internet

78
00:03:31,680 --> 00:03:34,920
ordinal security txt and rpki and we set

79
00:03:34,920 --> 00:03:36,420
them to Orange so there's a lot of

80
00:03:36,420 --> 00:03:38,040
orange and the first greens are starting

81
00:03:38,040 --> 00:03:40,260
to pop up which is nice sometimes it's a

82
00:03:40,260 --> 00:03:41,640
measurement issue

83
00:03:41,640 --> 00:03:44,280
um we rank them also so this is the the

84
00:03:44,280 --> 00:03:47,819
top uh three of uh municipalities or

85
00:03:47,819 --> 00:03:50,540
Municipal organizations

86
00:03:50,540 --> 00:03:53,540
is a technical issue

87
00:03:53,540 --> 00:03:56,580
where we are technically correct which

88
00:03:56,580 --> 00:03:59,159
is the best kind of correct but it's not

89
00:03:59,159 --> 00:04:01,379
really a security issue so they have to

90
00:04:01,379 --> 00:04:03,180
do a small infra change and then they

91
00:04:03,180 --> 00:04:05,640
will fall out of this top three then

92
00:04:05,640 --> 00:04:07,260
it's a Municipality of Amsterdam which

93
00:04:07,260 --> 00:04:10,980
is huge they have like in insane amounts

94
00:04:10,980 --> 00:04:13,760
of domains and then it's the foreign

95
00:04:13,760 --> 00:04:17,459
which is ironically the organization in

96
00:04:17,459 --> 00:04:21,120
charge of security for municipalities so

97
00:04:21,120 --> 00:04:24,540
um and to be nicer to them because they

98
00:04:24,540 --> 00:04:26,340
do a lot a lot of things right like a

99
00:04:26,340 --> 00:04:28,440
lot of things right but they have one

100
00:04:28,440 --> 00:04:30,720
domain where they still have to do a few

101
00:04:30,720 --> 00:04:32,699
things and

102
00:04:32,699 --> 00:04:36,240
they know so I think probably next week

103
00:04:36,240 --> 00:04:38,040
they'll they'll just do like this and

104
00:04:38,040 --> 00:04:40,380
they will fall out of the top three we

105
00:04:40,380 --> 00:04:42,479
have like graphs over time like numbers

106
00:04:42,479 --> 00:04:44,580
at how many vulnerabilities there are

107
00:04:44,580 --> 00:04:46,860
per vulnerability and a search so this

108
00:04:46,860 --> 00:04:50,160
is the example they have this domain

109
00:04:50,160 --> 00:04:53,820
name vng International and uh yeah

110
00:04:53,820 --> 00:04:55,680
basically all of the issues are on that

111
00:04:55,680 --> 00:04:57,979
domain and not all of the rest

112
00:04:57,979 --> 00:05:01,080
you can see it here so like version

113
00:05:01,080 --> 00:05:04,560
exposure you see security is missing you

114
00:05:04,560 --> 00:05:06,919
cannot email them in a secure way

115
00:05:06,919 --> 00:05:09,300
there's no trust in the certificate they

116
00:05:09,300 --> 00:05:11,100
use maybe it's expired they use

117
00:05:11,100 --> 00:05:14,100
self-sign stuff I don't know but uh it's

118
00:05:14,100 --> 00:05:18,360
all all one side so oh and also you see

119
00:05:18,360 --> 00:05:21,600
more more graphs you can see to till one

120
00:05:21,600 --> 00:05:24,419
year in the past how they did there was

121
00:05:24,419 --> 00:05:26,880
a slight issue here with our systems and

122
00:05:26,880 --> 00:05:29,220
then yeah well we fixed things and

123
00:05:29,220 --> 00:05:31,860
things are up and running again so what

124
00:05:31,860 --> 00:05:34,500
does this do if you make security very

125
00:05:34,500 --> 00:05:36,259
very transparent well

126
00:05:36,259 --> 00:05:38,639
tens of thousands of security fixes

127
00:05:38,639 --> 00:05:41,220
happened which is awesome

128
00:05:41,220 --> 00:05:43,380
but most importantly

129
00:05:43,380 --> 00:05:46,680
because it's in a presented in a way

130
00:05:46,680 --> 00:05:48,840
that people can understand especially

131
00:05:48,840 --> 00:05:51,060
sea level people they can see colors

132
00:05:51,060 --> 00:05:54,060
mostly and uh

133
00:05:54,060 --> 00:05:57,479
they have they have like an allergy for

134
00:05:57,479 --> 00:06:00,300
red for some reason they don't like the

135
00:06:00,300 --> 00:06:02,400
color red so if they see their

136
00:06:02,400 --> 00:06:05,220
organization with a red color and yeah

137
00:06:05,220 --> 00:06:06,960
the neighboring organization it does not

138
00:06:06,960 --> 00:06:08,880
have a red color they are green then

139
00:06:08,880 --> 00:06:11,759
they're like we want to be green too so

140
00:06:11,759 --> 00:06:13,979
suddenly the CP level people start to

141
00:06:13,979 --> 00:06:15,900
understand security for a little bit and

142
00:06:15,900 --> 00:06:18,660
then they give budget to the IT people

143
00:06:18,660 --> 00:06:20,639
that are already saying for years that

144
00:06:20,639 --> 00:06:22,500
there are things that it should be fixed

145
00:06:22,500 --> 00:06:26,539
so it's basically a shift in uh

146
00:06:26,539 --> 00:06:30,360
uh how how uh it's basically a way to

147
00:06:30,360 --> 00:06:31,979
get a little bit of budget to actually

148
00:06:31,979 --> 00:06:34,560
fix things because the I.T people know

149
00:06:34,560 --> 00:06:35,580
for years

150
00:06:35,580 --> 00:06:39,000
stuff has to change so

151
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:42,780
um so transparency helps a lot

152
00:06:42,780 --> 00:06:45,419
so there's a few updates we I did a talk

153
00:06:45,419 --> 00:06:48,960
like in 2019 that's been a while

154
00:06:48,960 --> 00:06:51,300
we still have this somewhere of the same

155
00:06:51,300 --> 00:06:53,580
amount of organizations we cleaned up a

156
00:06:53,580 --> 00:06:54,419
lot

157
00:06:54,419 --> 00:06:58,919
um we monitor 90 000 domains one million

158
00:06:58,919 --> 00:07:01,259
endpoints and we have like 9.5 unique

159
00:07:01,259 --> 00:07:03,780
metrics in the database now samples

160
00:07:03,780 --> 00:07:06,180
taken every day is like one two two

161
00:07:06,180 --> 00:07:08,759
million metrics so with measurements so

162
00:07:08,759 --> 00:07:11,880
it's a it's a lot

163
00:07:11,880 --> 00:07:13,319
um

164
00:07:13,319 --> 00:07:17,280
we uh we removed the old and clingy

165
00:07:17,280 --> 00:07:21,360
jungle front end and uh kick the kick

166
00:07:21,360 --> 00:07:23,639
the ginger templates and replace it with

167
00:07:23,639 --> 00:07:25,319
the JavaScript framework which is a

168
00:07:25,319 --> 00:07:29,759
pretty nice I feel young again so

169
00:07:29,759 --> 00:07:32,160
oh

170
00:07:32,160 --> 00:07:35,099
um there have been a lot of maps added

171
00:07:35,099 --> 00:07:38,340
to the system so you can see all the

172
00:07:38,340 --> 00:07:40,199
Ministries for example you can compare

173
00:07:40,199 --> 00:07:41,940
the Ministry of Finance to the ministry

174
00:07:41,940 --> 00:07:43,919
of Defense if you want

175
00:07:43,919 --> 00:07:46,560
um they're all equally equally equally

176
00:07:46,560 --> 00:07:49,580
red now so

177
00:07:49,800 --> 00:07:53,360
and we also did something that is like

178
00:07:53,360 --> 00:07:56,880
we did like oh we let's hope it works

179
00:07:56,880 --> 00:08:00,599
and now we have insights in the quality

180
00:08:00,599 --> 00:08:02,520
of the data that we present so if it's

181
00:08:02,520 --> 00:08:05,099
up to date or not and you can see like

182
00:08:05,099 --> 00:08:07,199
there's one or two metrics that are

183
00:08:07,199 --> 00:08:12,599
outdated but uh 99.85 is up to date so

184
00:08:12,599 --> 00:08:13,680
that's good

185
00:08:13,680 --> 00:08:16,020
uh we have a lot of a lot of graphs and

186
00:08:16,020 --> 00:08:17,580
and stats of all the systems that we're

187
00:08:17,580 --> 00:08:20,340
running thanks to Johan

188
00:08:20,340 --> 00:08:22,919
um we've got alerts on our own so

189
00:08:22,919 --> 00:08:25,979
that's also nice we also measure our own

190
00:08:25,979 --> 00:08:28,379
stuff so it's also nice each our own dog

191
00:08:28,379 --> 00:08:31,020
food the code coverage has been improved

192
00:08:31,020 --> 00:08:34,679
from 40 to 60 uh for testing your own

193
00:08:34,679 --> 00:08:37,140
software basically all the new stuff is

194
00:08:37,140 --> 00:08:39,120
tested all the old stuff is like it

195
00:08:39,120 --> 00:08:41,039
works

196
00:08:41,039 --> 00:08:43,440
so uh and every time you look at it then

197
00:08:43,440 --> 00:08:46,140
you add a test to it so the amount of

198
00:08:46,140 --> 00:08:49,019
metrics that we've added is has grown ex

199
00:08:49,019 --> 00:08:51,060
like exploded

200
00:08:51,060 --> 00:08:53,279
these are the ones that we publish or

201
00:08:53,279 --> 00:08:55,620
publish very soon so the the stuff on

202
00:08:55,620 --> 00:08:57,740
the left was like DNS I can search

203
00:08:57,740 --> 00:09:00,959
I already said we added the new stuffer

204
00:09:00,959 --> 00:09:03,180
security txt for internet from internet

205
00:09:03,180 --> 00:09:04,459
NL

206
00:09:04,459 --> 00:09:06,200
rpki

207
00:09:06,200 --> 00:09:09,480
the new security headers

208
00:09:09,480 --> 00:09:12,480
and we're now working on we have got a

209
00:09:12,480 --> 00:09:14,339
better running of third-party tracking

210
00:09:14,339 --> 00:09:16,920
so Google Analytics

211
00:09:16,920 --> 00:09:19,019
and other funny surveillance capitalism

212
00:09:19,019 --> 00:09:22,140
tools we can just see like how how much

213
00:09:22,140 --> 00:09:26,040
is that's in use and it's it's a lot we

214
00:09:26,040 --> 00:09:27,779
don't know how to grade it but it will

215
00:09:27,779 --> 00:09:30,779
be high somewhere in the future with

216
00:09:30,779 --> 00:09:32,880
when it's introduced will be low or

217
00:09:32,880 --> 00:09:34,680
medium but uh

218
00:09:34,680 --> 00:09:37,380
yeah it's uh and we we present like in

219
00:09:37,380 --> 00:09:38,880
the finding in the in the in the report

220
00:09:38,880 --> 00:09:41,220
of that thing is like oh you're using

221
00:09:41,220 --> 00:09:42,899
this or this if you want to have like

222
00:09:42,899 --> 00:09:44,519
visitor analytics you can choose from

223
00:09:44,519 --> 00:09:46,980
one of these 20 fenders which is which

224
00:09:46,980 --> 00:09:49,140
are all open source which you can run

225
00:09:49,140 --> 00:09:50,700
your own and you don't have to share

226
00:09:50,700 --> 00:09:54,779
your stuff with an American company so

227
00:09:54,779 --> 00:09:57,899
um the build time has uh and deployment

228
00:09:57,899 --> 00:10:00,959
time has been uh decreased dramatically

229
00:10:00,959 --> 00:10:02,420
um and that's a lot of fun because

230
00:10:02,420 --> 00:10:03,060
[Music]

231
00:10:03,060 --> 00:10:03,720
um

232
00:10:03,720 --> 00:10:06,300
we can if if you have like an idea you

233
00:10:06,300 --> 00:10:08,760
want to add an emoji for example it's

234
00:10:08,760 --> 00:10:11,580
like 10 minutes it's live so it's uh

235
00:10:11,580 --> 00:10:13,440
that's that's nice

236
00:10:13,440 --> 00:10:15,959
and we're also uh replacing those

237
00:10:15,959 --> 00:10:19,320
stateful dreaded os's uh we are

238
00:10:19,320 --> 00:10:21,899
currently deploying that's Johan's uh

239
00:10:21,899 --> 00:10:25,200
uh thing uh we're currently you're

240
00:10:25,200 --> 00:10:27,720
running on Ubuntu and puppet

241
00:10:27,720 --> 00:10:30,440
um and we're replacing that with Nexus

242
00:10:30,440 --> 00:10:33,899
and that's uh it's a challenge it's also

243
00:10:33,899 --> 00:10:36,240
uh fun so

244
00:10:36,240 --> 00:10:39,060
we think that there's a future in nixoso

245
00:10:39,060 --> 00:10:42,120
we try to and and we hope that it solves

246
00:10:42,120 --> 00:10:43,980
a lot of those issues with package

247
00:10:43,980 --> 00:10:46,200
updates and such

248
00:10:46,200 --> 00:10:48,899
um we also added a small surface VR

249
00:10:48,899 --> 00:10:50,640
foundation so

250
00:10:50,640 --> 00:10:52,620
um but we have like memberships and if

251
00:10:52,620 --> 00:10:54,440
you become a member of the foundation

252
00:10:54,440 --> 00:10:56,459
specifically targeted for like

253
00:10:56,459 --> 00:10:58,560
organizations like municipality so not

254
00:10:58,560 --> 00:11:01,560
the people in this room so then you get

255
00:11:01,560 --> 00:11:03,720
like bash profiling plus if you have a

256
00:11:03,720 --> 00:11:06,240
regression you get an email from hey

257
00:11:06,240 --> 00:11:07,920
there's something wrong you can do

258
00:11:07,920 --> 00:11:10,920
something before the next time the map

259
00:11:10,920 --> 00:11:12,360
is updated

260
00:11:12,360 --> 00:11:14,940
uh we have a we are trying to build a

261
00:11:14,940 --> 00:11:17,040
community

262
00:11:17,040 --> 00:11:20,100
um with ite Specialists that are running

263
00:11:20,100 --> 00:11:22,320
all this stuff so they can share the

264
00:11:22,320 --> 00:11:24,360
knowledge share configurations share

265
00:11:24,360 --> 00:11:27,720
what they're doing to drastically reduce

266
00:11:27,720 --> 00:11:30,420
the cost of it maintenance and I.T

267
00:11:30,420 --> 00:11:33,380
security so that's that's the end goal

268
00:11:33,380 --> 00:11:36,000
we believe that security should be free

269
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:37,260
like

270
00:11:37,260 --> 00:11:39,959
extremely cheap and the goal is like to

271
00:11:39,959 --> 00:11:42,360
get a community and reduce costs and

272
00:11:42,360 --> 00:11:44,880
reduce costs and reduce costs and also

273
00:11:44,880 --> 00:11:47,880
reduce like the community the membership

274
00:11:47,880 --> 00:11:50,519
fee like which is now like 49 euros a

275
00:11:50,519 --> 00:11:53,339
month or so to basically zero that's the

276
00:11:53,339 --> 00:11:55,560
goal so

277
00:11:55,560 --> 00:11:56,399
um

278
00:11:56,399 --> 00:11:58,680
some things behind the scenes

279
00:11:58,680 --> 00:12:01,440
um we are using a bunch of tools if you

280
00:12:01,440 --> 00:12:03,480
are doing the first day of pen testing

281
00:12:03,480 --> 00:12:06,560
then you might know all of these

282
00:12:06,560 --> 00:12:09,120
it's like the basic hygiene set of

283
00:12:09,120 --> 00:12:11,820
security tools

284
00:12:11,820 --> 00:12:13,500
um there there are like a million

285
00:12:13,500 --> 00:12:16,500
gazillion tools we check what they can

286
00:12:16,500 --> 00:12:19,079
do how they can help how much impact

287
00:12:19,079 --> 00:12:22,920
they have on society and based on that

288
00:12:22,920 --> 00:12:25,800
we select the next one and the next one

289
00:12:25,800 --> 00:12:28,320
and the next one to add

290
00:12:28,320 --> 00:12:29,100
um

291
00:12:29,100 --> 00:12:31,680
we use openstreetmap and weak data those

292
00:12:31,680 --> 00:12:34,560
are awesome systems to get these maps to

293
00:12:34,560 --> 00:12:38,519
get the Geo data into the system and we

294
00:12:38,519 --> 00:12:39,980
read the

295
00:12:39,980 --> 00:12:44,700
Dutch what Dutch sources of websites

296
00:12:44,700 --> 00:12:46,800
like if you watched Aryan Luba like two

297
00:12:46,800 --> 00:12:49,740
weeks two weeks back uh yeah all of

298
00:12:49,740 --> 00:12:52,200
those domains are in there

299
00:12:52,200 --> 00:12:53,940
it's a lot

300
00:12:53,940 --> 00:12:56,519
um if you want to follow this it's open

301
00:12:56,519 --> 00:12:58,680
source you can download the stuff it's

302
00:12:58,680 --> 00:13:01,800
on the gitlab it's a sponsor the

303
00:13:01,800 --> 00:13:04,440
sponsors with unlimited builds and like

304
00:13:04,440 --> 00:13:07,560
the gold tier stuff

305
00:13:07,560 --> 00:13:10,680
um we also are sponsored by cobites they

306
00:13:10,680 --> 00:13:13,139
do the hosting it's a lot oh I see they

307
00:13:13,139 --> 00:13:15,600
didn't finish the slide but uh they uh

308
00:13:15,600 --> 00:13:17,639
they do the hosting um and it's a very

309
00:13:17,639 --> 00:13:20,160
small machine it's like 30 gig to two

310
00:13:20,160 --> 00:13:22,139
gigs of RAM 16 core student of the gig

311
00:13:22,139 --> 00:13:23,820
disk

312
00:13:23,820 --> 00:13:26,399
um that's today is a small server

313
00:13:26,399 --> 00:13:28,560
um I guess

314
00:13:28,560 --> 00:13:30,959
um and mostly it's building the reports

315
00:13:30,959 --> 00:13:32,459
that's the thing that takes most time

316
00:13:32,459 --> 00:13:34,440
but the rest is just waiting for network

317
00:13:34,440 --> 00:13:36,360
traffic the application is mostly

318
00:13:36,360 --> 00:13:37,740
waiting for network traffic and

319
00:13:37,740 --> 00:13:41,339
responses from what we are measuring so

320
00:13:41,339 --> 00:13:42,959
um oh yeah

321
00:13:42,959 --> 00:13:44,880
one more thing I always wanted to use

322
00:13:44,880 --> 00:13:47,519
this phrase

323
00:13:47,519 --> 00:13:52,019
because our departed friends Steve

324
00:13:52,019 --> 00:13:54,079
um

325
00:13:54,180 --> 00:13:56,040
is the first project from the hacker

326
00:13:56,040 --> 00:13:56,820
scene

327
00:13:56,820 --> 00:13:59,899
that made it into national security

328
00:13:59,899 --> 00:14:03,180
policy covering the entire Dutch

329
00:14:03,180 --> 00:14:05,359
government

330
00:14:09,420 --> 00:14:10,800
and that's

331
00:14:10,800 --> 00:14:12,720
that's pretty cool

332
00:14:12,720 --> 00:14:15,610
are we insanely rich now no

333
00:14:15,610 --> 00:14:18,660
[Laughter]

334
00:14:18,660 --> 00:14:21,600
um so but it does open doors

335
00:14:21,600 --> 00:14:24,959
uh are we the government now no no

336
00:14:24,959 --> 00:14:27,899
uh there's a construction that goes

337
00:14:27,899 --> 00:14:29,399
that's called a public private

338
00:14:29,399 --> 00:14:30,779
partnership

339
00:14:30,779 --> 00:14:34,440
we're the public part the uh I mean the

340
00:14:34,440 --> 00:14:36,180
private part ah the private part always

341
00:14:36,180 --> 00:14:38,160
sounds disgusting

342
00:14:38,160 --> 00:14:39,959
um but uh we work with the government

343
00:14:39,959 --> 00:14:42,300
that's basically a way to to tell it the

344
00:14:42,300 --> 00:14:44,459
the Centrum information and privacy

345
00:14:44,459 --> 00:14:46,320
programming is the government partner

346
00:14:46,320 --> 00:14:47,880
and it's funded by the national

347
00:14:47,880 --> 00:14:51,300
coordinator against terrorism and for

348
00:14:51,300 --> 00:14:53,220
security for safety I don't know the

349
00:14:53,220 --> 00:14:56,279
right relation so basically the funny

350
00:14:56,279 --> 00:14:58,620
joke is always we are fighting terrorism

351
00:14:58,620 --> 00:15:03,240
so but uh I think it's more Pro safety

352
00:15:03,240 --> 00:15:05,760
um and I found it they funded and yeah

353
00:15:05,760 --> 00:15:08,040
we can run this for a few years which is

354
00:15:08,040 --> 00:15:10,680
awesome uh the most important thing is

355
00:15:10,680 --> 00:15:13,079
that it opens doors so

356
00:15:13,079 --> 00:15:15,120
um it's it's it's a lot more legit now

357
00:15:15,120 --> 00:15:18,240
instead of just uh to people in an attic

358
00:15:18,240 --> 00:15:20,339
that scan the internet which is what it

359
00:15:20,339 --> 00:15:21,420
is

360
00:15:21,420 --> 00:15:24,660
uh it's a it is

361
00:15:24,660 --> 00:15:28,320
um uh in this booklet and if you uh dive

362
00:15:28,320 --> 00:15:31,440
in there you can find in the deep deep

363
00:15:31,440 --> 00:15:37,339
you can see like uh in Pilot aim dude

364
00:15:40,459 --> 00:15:43,139
there's a lot of texture Anderson

365
00:15:43,139 --> 00:15:45,660
there's much for everything so

366
00:15:45,660 --> 00:15:48,779
uh which is awesome

367
00:15:48,779 --> 00:15:51,000
um so that's basically the the whole

368
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:52,320
thing of the stock I can show you the

369
00:15:52,320 --> 00:15:54,000

organizations that are being scanned

416
00:17:52,740 --> 00:17:55,200
that are not aware that something that

417
00:17:55,200 --> 00:17:58,140
they might do something wrong or you are

418
00:17:58,140 --> 00:18:01,559

thank you

428
00:18:28,740 --> 00:18:31,020
okay we have uh time for two more

429
00:18:31,020 --> 00:18:33,059
questions so if people have questions to

430
00:18:33,059 --> 00:18:35,460
ask her about this amazing initiative

431
00:18:35,460 --> 00:18:38,100
then here we go

432
00:18:38,100 --> 00:18:41,760
the nctv is involved financially

433
00:18:41,760 --> 00:18:44,100
did they buy themselves influence

434
00:18:44,100 --> 00:18:47,820
by influence uh no no that's that's the

435
00:18:47,820 --> 00:18:49,200
beauty of a public-private partnership

436
00:18:49,200 --> 00:18:53,880
the core of that is that there is no say

437
00:18:53,880 --> 00:18:56,700
of the government of what the private

438
00:18:56,700 --> 00:18:58,740
organization is doing so of course not

439
00:18:58,740 --> 00:19:01,020
otherwise I would I would not agree with

440
00:19:01,020 --> 00:19:02,100
such thing

441
00:19:02,100 --> 00:19:04,559
ever

442
00:19:04,559 --> 00:19:05,539
yeah

443
00:19:05,539 --> 00:19:08,160
I have other countries already shown

444
00:19:08,160 --> 00:19:09,900
interest because it's such a cool

445
00:19:09,900 --> 00:19:11,100
project

446
00:19:11,100 --> 00:19:13,860
we try to find other countries we do

447
00:19:13,860 --> 00:19:17,039
have an instance running in uh I always

448
00:19:17,039 --> 00:19:18,480
forget the name of the country and

449
00:19:18,480 --> 00:19:20,700
that's ingrained I always forget it when

450
00:19:20,700 --> 00:19:23,160
somebody asks this

451
00:19:23,160 --> 00:19:25,799
and that's how that's ingrained now

452
00:19:25,799 --> 00:19:28,380
um we we're

453
00:19:28,380 --> 00:19:30,720
Bulgaria we run it in Bulgaria now from

454
00:19:30,720 --> 00:19:32,760
the government as well they have a

455
00:19:32,760 --> 00:19:34,559
incident running but that's not a public

456
00:19:34,559 --> 00:19:36,539
instance and that's something we hope

457
00:19:36,539 --> 00:19:38,940
that they want to go public but it's an

458
00:19:38,940 --> 00:19:42,179
entire different culture and we did try

459
00:19:42,179 --> 00:19:45,840
uh running maps in the UK and Germany

460
00:19:45,840 --> 00:19:47,760
um but we did not find the volunteers to

461
00:19:47,760 --> 00:19:53,820
uh handle the uh amount of uh like the

462
00:19:53,820 --> 00:19:56,820
getting it keeping it running so setting

463
00:19:56,820 --> 00:19:59,280
up is not a part that's difficult it's

464
00:19:59,280 --> 00:20:02,299
keeping it running and deal with uh

465
00:20:02,299 --> 00:20:05,900
Angry German emails

466
00:20:05,900 --> 00:20:09,000
for example

467
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:10,640
okay okay

468
00:20:10,640 --> 00:20:13,020
let's uh let's talk that's a lot of fun

469
00:20:13,020 --> 00:20:17,160
that's my one of my uh personal uh end

470
00:20:17,160 --> 00:20:19,919
