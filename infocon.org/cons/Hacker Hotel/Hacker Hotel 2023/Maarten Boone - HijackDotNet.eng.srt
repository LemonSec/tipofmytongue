2
00:00:02,639 --> 00:00:05,419
okay welcome

3
00:00:07,160 --> 00:00:10,160
Martin

4
00:00:15,600 --> 00:00:18,500
[Music]

5
00:00:18,500 --> 00:00:21,439
actually Started With A

6
00:00:21,439 --> 00:00:25,380
hagaton that Webber invited to do uh to

7
00:00:25,380 --> 00:00:30,380
test dus security of bodycams en eh

8
00:00:30,380 --> 00:00:33,120
ben die Started Out We Are split into

9
00:00:33,120 --> 00:00:36,300
two teams One Team eh was put on the

10
00:00:36,300 --> 00:00:38,100
hardware part of the bodycam  and I was

11
00:00:38,100 --> 00:00:40,200
prett with a View people on the software

12
00:00:40,200 --> 00:00:43,800
part eh The firsting refund Out was that

13
00:00:43,800 --> 00:00:46,320
uh The Management Software that was used

14
00:00:46,320 --> 00:00:49,200
for the bodygames force brittanan.net eh

15
00:00:49,200 --> 00:00:51,239
The nice Thing about.net is that It's a

16
00:00:51,239 --> 00:00:53,059
manage language

17
00:00:53,059 --> 00:00:56,340
it's very easy to  for example de

18
00:00:56,340 --> 00:01:00,000
compilots eh except in certifications

19
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,579
for example When Dave eh used Office

20
00:01:02,579 --> 00:01:04,820
station

21
00:01:06,140 --> 00:01:10,619
die Compilation Technics eh Another

22
00:01:10,619 --> 00:01:12,500
problem with the software was that

23
00:01:12,500 --> 00:01:14,820
required the License to Run and we

24
00:01:14,820 --> 00:01:17,180
didn't have license

25
00:01:17,180 --> 00:01:20,759
the next per on was that uh basically We

26
00:01:20,759 --> 00:01:23,240
Could See  that uh Olde

27
00:01:23,240 --> 00:01:25,200
functionality That We Need it to

28
00:01:25,200 --> 00:01:27,320
communicate with uh

29
00:01:27,320 --> 00:01:33,479
uh de bodycam was Ashley Presence eh in

30
00:01:33,479 --> 00:01:36,439
een Shepherd dll that game with the

31
00:01:36,439 --> 00:01:41,880
application so The eh second Call became

32
00:01:41,880 --> 00:01:46,939
eh Being able to Load eh Parts of the

33
00:01:46,939 --> 00:01:50,899
original managements software s eh

34
00:01:50,899 --> 00:01:54,200
Library in  Our Own software And then

35
00:01:54,200 --> 00:01:58,320
Talk eh en communicate with eh and his

36
00:01:58,320 --> 00:02:00,840
fairy you were communicating with Any

37
00:02:00,840 --> 00:02:05,399
regular other library eh however eh to

38
00:02:05,399 --> 00:02:08,880
do this it uh it exley required a lot of

39
00:02:08,880 --> 00:02:12,020
Manual work As you can see Here Ja The

40
00:02:12,020 --> 00:02:15,420
resolution is on that Great  but first he have

41
00:02:15,420 --> 00:02:19,099
to Load eh the Target would de

42
00:02:19,099 --> 00:02:22,099
software that you actually want to eh eh

43
00:02:22,099 --> 00:02:25,700
eggs extracts circumf functionality from

44
00:02:25,700 --> 00:02:28,140
They you need to re Visual of the type And

45
00:02:28,140 --> 00:02:30,660
then Turn The type into an object And

46
00:02:30,660 --> 00:02:33,140
ben je kent talk to the objects but

47
00:02:33,140 --> 00:02:35,640

eh is native Sharp en We  used that to eh

99
00:05:19,880 --> 00:05:24,479
to inject Our hooking library into

100
00:05:24,479 --> 00:05:26,580

don't have Any fixed eh code for

actually a Stepping Stone eh when i made it

145
00:07:46,020 --> 00:07:49,560

start The Wizard is Just click file

153
00:08:12,419 --> 00:08:16,319
I took The NS Core library as ANAC

154
00:08:16,319 --> 00:08:18,319

171
00:09:09,660 --> 00:09:12,180
want  to lock for example The Return

172
00:09:12,180 --> 00:09:14,940
value eh if you want to modify the

173
00:09:14,940 --> 00:09:17,760
reader value so in this case It's A guid

174
00:09:17,760 --> 00:09:20,820
uh So you will actually get a witch

175
00:09:20,820 --> 00:09:24,019
editor impert that you can use uh

176
00:09:24,019 --> 00:09:27,360
to inputer New One

177
00:09:27,360 --> 00:09:31,380
Eh who me this easier to Load you  can

178
00:09:31,380 --> 00:09:34,019
also Right click and selecte file with

179
00:09:34,019 --> 00:09:37,519
the content dat je one two eh

180
00:09:37,519 --> 00:09:40,820

also

183
00:09:46,519 --> 00:09:49,860
lochers for specific type zo in discase

184
00:09:49,860 --> 00:09:52,580
It's uh for example RC

185
00:09:52,580 --> 00:09:56,180
permerters dat is eh dit is a value

186
00:09:56,180 --> 00:10:00,140
used in the RC in imponentation of.  net

187
00:10:00,140 --> 00:10:02,820
self for example if you want you Fox

188
00:10:02,820 --> 00:10:06,560
into Those libraries You Could eh

189
00:10:06,560 --> 00:10:09,200
yousee to eh log

190
00:10:09,200 --> 00:10:12,660
oranipulate someone's eh are you say

191
00:10:12,660 --> 00:10:16,620
Keys for exempel eh but eh the niiste

192
00:10:16,620 --> 00:10:18,720
things remain the type Lover is is that

193
00:10:18,720 --> 00:10:21,300
it all so Works On structures And you

194
00:10:21,300 --> 00:10:23,820
can  actually Select Witch Field of the

195
00:10:23,820 --> 00:10:26,640
structure You Want To Look So if it is

196
00:10:26,640 --> 00:10:28,680
not all interesting you can Just Pick

197
00:10:28,680 --> 00:10:31,339
The Parts that you are interested in

198
00:10:31,339 --> 00:10:35,399
eh Benders Old so custom type loggers if

199
00:10:35,399 --> 00:10:37,680
you want to do really Crazy stuff with

200
00:10:37,680 --> 00:10:40,080
eh with the stuff that  Comes in It's but

201
00:10:40,080 --> 00:10:43,080
basically atten plating engine eh that

202
00:10:43,080 --> 00:10:47,100
supports eh full interest caesarp eh all

203
00:10:47,100 --> 00:10:48,720
the Coated You Right Here will also be

204
00:10:48,720 --> 00:10:52,260
edit to the eh hooking configuration is

205
00:10:52,260 --> 00:10:55,680
Will Be Saint to the process uh that is

206
00:10:55,680 --> 00:10:59,160
Running The eh The angulation engine adds

207
00:10:59,160 --> 00:11:01,980
eh Dead  Ferry moment en het wil compe

nou

211
00:11:13,260 --> 00:11:16,380
Once your finished creating one of these

212
00:11:16,380 --> 00:11:19,560
angle sits relaxedly be eh turned into a

213

holebrunch of Jason en eh dish will be

214
00:11:23,180 --> 00:11:27,200
compressed en base

215
00:11:27,200 --> 00:11:30,060
sexy Four en codeton Danger can  feed it

216
00:11:30,060 --> 00:11:32,880
to the engine engine will um package

217
00:11:32,880 --> 00:11:36,480
apply all the hooks eh en dennisbal

218

start login or Whatever You eh

219
00:11:41,220 --> 00:11:45,060
defined For The Rules To Be Doing

220
00:11:45,060 --> 00:11:48,620
eh Benders also Another Way of

221
00:11:48,620 --> 00:11:51,720
starting project with the targeting

222
00:11:51,720 --> 00:11:55,019
Helper and the targeting Helper 2

223
00:11:55,019 --> 00:11:57,800
options for eksempel you  can file

224
00:11:57,800 --> 00:12:01,140
So you can Select a dot net winery in

225
00:12:01,140 --> 00:12:03,000
then It will automatically extract

226
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:05,940
divisional The Run Time de Architecture

227
00:12:05,940 --> 00:12:10,980
that is eh en de.net eh framework

228
00:12:10,980 --> 00:12:13,440
version dat Unity use

229
00:12:13,440 --> 00:12:15,540
uh and you can do anything off it

230
00:12:15,540 --> 00:12:17,760
processor could you if we do  with

231
00:12:17,760 --> 00:12:22,160
eh Running processor for example

232
00:12:23,360 --> 00:12:27,240
A few Different ways of injecting your

233
00:12:27,240 --> 00:12:30,839
binary Into the Target you can do Side

234
00:12:30,839 --> 00:12:33,079
loading

235
00:12:36,019 --> 00:12:39,019
configuration file That You put in the

236
00:12:39,019 --> 00:12:42,079
Target directory and It will

237
00:12:42,079 --> 00:12:45,839
automatically Load your ll sound is

238
00:12:45,839 --> 00:12:48,120
start the application than you can applier

239
00:12:48,120 --> 00:12:49,100
oaks

240
00:12:49,100 --> 00:12:51,300
Another Way  of doing This actually

241
00:12:51,300 --> 00:12:53,760
patching It Into the Target then It will

242
00:12:53,760 --> 00:12:56,760
actually modern Target winery to first

243
00:12:56,760 --> 00:13:00,019
Load your binary apply oldehooksen Them

244
00:13:00,019 --> 00:13:02,820
continue to the original entry Point of

245
00:13:02,820 --> 00:13:06,300
the bindar and the other tray two are

246
00:13:06,300 --> 00:13:11,820
used for live process eh would you

247
00:13:11,820 --> 00:13:13,860
actually injected into  something that is

248
00:13:13,860 --> 00:13:19,279
already Running And then apply oldehooks

249
00:13:19,339 --> 00:13:22,399
so Well what

250
00:13:22,399 --> 00:13:24,779
would be busy I already didn't happen

251
00:13:24,779 --> 00:13:29,160
is you have your High jack.net Wizard

252
00:13:29,160 --> 00:13:33,139
used to create Rules older

253
00:13:33,139 --> 00:13:37,700
Jason en push Todd Broker

254
00:13:37,700 --> 00:13:41,220
eh The Broker has abrimes of clients in

255
00:13:41,220 --> 00:13:45,420
the form  of eh Oil engine eh that you

256
00:13:45,420 --> 00:13:48,420
have injected interior targets en they

257
00:13:48,420 --> 00:13:51,500
will First get the configuration to use

258
00:13:51,500 --> 00:13:54,959
from the Center Broker appliet en them

259
00:13:54,959 --> 00:13:57,839
all the eh stuff that is dit is going to

260
00:13:57,839 --> 00:14:01,100
log will be lockback to the mqtt brother

261
00:14:01,100 --> 00:14:04,620
en nou de nice Thing  about mtg is dat is

262
00:14:04,620 --> 00:14:07,019
very easy to Interface So you can also

263
00:14:07,019 --> 00:14:11,160
Rides eh custom tooling for example 2

264
00:14:11,160 --> 00:14:15,000
collect uh logs eh naar zijn hal-bandjes

265
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:17,760
of API calls you can

266
00:14:17,760 --> 00:14:21,420
eh Sense to the dotnet loader you can

267
00:14:21,420 --> 00:14:24,300
make it Stop Start you can for eksempel

268
00:14:24,300 --> 00:14:27,180
attach a console to the process dat je

269
00:14:27,180 --> 00:14:31,620
have injected in Which is easy if your

270
00:14:31,620 --> 00:14:33,480
debugging for example Because you can

271
00:14:33,480 --> 00:14:35,180
Out that all your

272
00:14:35,180 --> 00:14:38,040
tracer sum to Dead

273
00:14:38,040 --> 00:14:41,839
eh you can actually make it uh unhook

274
00:14:41,839 --> 00:14:44,459
everything you just angle you can Clear

275
00:14:44,459 --> 00:14:47,399
all the hooks you can  Load auditional

276
00:14:47,399 --> 00:14:49,459
hooks or new hooks and

277
00:14:49,459 --> 00:14:53,279
everything is underfly would you do it This

278
00:14:53,279 --> 00:14:56,820
World The processor Running eh thenders

279
00:14:56,820 --> 00:14:58,860
Old so Un Option To Safe the corner is

280
00:14:58,860 --> 00:15:01,500
currently Active with in the

281
00:15:01,500 --> 00:15:04,139
process So It will extract all the Hook

282
00:15:04,139 --> 00:15:09,680
Turn Them Back Into eh Jason  and

283
00:15:21,930 --> 00:15:28,019
[Music]

284
00:15:28,019 --> 00:15:34,040
and the burden of is Execute code and that

285
00:16:36,660 --> 00:16:39,380
yes yes

286
00:16:39,380 --> 00:16:42,440
the burden of is Execute code in it eh

287
00:16:42,440 --> 00:16:46,399
actually allows you to Just injector

288
00:16:46,399 --> 00:16:49,139
that you have Just code yourself an It

289
00:16:49,139 --> 00:16:52,079
will be executed Within The contracts eh

290
00:16:52,079 --> 00:16:54,660
of the Target process and  then you can

291
00:16:54,660 --> 00:16:58,680
basically talk to everything

292
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:03,000


293
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:06,679


294
00:17:06,679 --> 00:17:09,179


295
00:17:09,179 --> 00:17:11,299


296
00:17:13,099 --> 00:17:18,198


297
00:17:18,500 --> 00:17:20,640


298
00:17:20,640 --> 00:17:23,040
you

299
00:17:23,040 --> 00:17:26,419
connectionally Overload and make Them uh

300
00:17:26,419 --> 00:17:29,520
reply With The Different value

301
00:17:29,520 --> 00:17:32,700
eh zo dit dit voor custom tooling wat

302
00:17:32,700 --> 00:17:36,840
sensites eh mqtt eh you

303
00:17:36,840 --> 00:17:40,919
can eating Go More notes So you can

304
00:17:40,919 --> 00:17:43,340
actually Connected to your homesystems

305
00:17:43,340 --> 00:17:48,600
and then Again with Google or Alexa And

306
00:17:48,600 --> 00:17:52,320
then you can actually  gift voice

307
00:17:52,320 --> 00:17:54,960
commands to Whatever You have Running

308
00:17:54,960 --> 00:17:57,620
There would that Could Be A root kit or

309
00:17:57,620 --> 00:18:00,979
Whatever You fight

310
00:18:01,440 --> 00:18:04,740


311
00:18:09,260 --> 00:18:13,500


312
00:18:17,900 --> 00:18:22,280


313
00:18:22,280 --> 00:18:25,160


314
00:18:25,160 --> 00:18:27,020


315
00:18:27,020 --> 00:18:29,059


316
00:18:29,059 --> 00:18:31,980
Of The ideas to

317
00:18:31,980 --> 00:18:36,140
actually make the complete Wizard and F1

318
00:18:36,140 --> 00:18:39,179
base So you can do everything that I

319
00:18:39,179 --> 00:18:42,260
just show you but then For Your browser

320
00:18:42,260 --> 00:18:44,940
Another Thing this Will Be Nice to be

321
00:18:44,940 --> 00:18:47,700
able to create Who Can rule packages eh

322
00:18:47,700 --> 00:18:52,200
a bit lik eh with eh Yara  that you

323
00:18:52,200 --> 00:18:55,020
connectionally export and eh Share Bed in

324
00:18:55,020 --> 00:18:58,080
the Community for example eh thenders as

325
00:18:58,080 --> 00:19:00,660
the text beast editorser you can actually

326
00:19:00,660 --> 00:19:02,700
eh Ride all the Jason for the Hoeks in

327
00:19:02,700 --> 00:19:06,059
the Rules yourself If You Hate van eh And

328
00:19:06,059 --> 00:19:09,419
there want our Bear native code API So

329
00:19:09,419 --> 00:19:12,539
you can  also Use the engine I just show

330
00:19:12,539 --> 00:19:17,419
you against native applications

331
00:19:44,539 --> 00:19:47,220
support itself for example is There's

332
00:19:47,220 --> 00:19:48,780
Another Architecture That We Don't

333
00:19:48,780 --> 00:19:51,500
support that you can actually Right a

334
00:19:51,500 --> 00:19:55,220
plug-in For That

335
00:19:55,740 --> 00:19:58,980
zo Thank you That's It

336
00:19:58,980 --> 00:20:02,179
and a questions

337
00:20:14,419 --> 00:20:16,100
you

dat net is everything that happens in

341
00:20:36,120 --> 00:20:38,539

value And then you have an Active Hook

345
00:20:54,200 --> 00:20:58,100
virus scanners think of this

346
00:21:01,760 --> 00:21:04,520
to

347
00:21:04,520 --> 00:21:08,480
measure execution Time

348
00:21:12,140 --> 00:21:17,039
profiling eh you connectly used to build

349
00:21:17,039 --> 00:21:21,840
shims for example 2  eh eh gif certain

350
00:21:21,840 --> 00:21:26,720
applications backwards compatibility uh

351
00:21:26,720 --> 00:21:29,520
you can beasts die even everything

352
00:21:29,520 --> 00:21:31,380
you can do with dot net you can also do

353
00:21:31,380 --> 00:21:34,020
