8

9
00:00:24,960 --> 00:00:27,539

39
00:01:45,060 --> 00:01:47,280

41

00:02:09,119 --> 00:02:11,899
of this

48
00:02:17,400 --> 00:02:20,540
does it already work

49
00:02:23,280 --> 00:02:26,700
yes cool

50
00:02:26,700 --> 00:02:28,020
okay guys

51
00:02:28,020 --> 00:02:30,720
thanks for being here so late I thought

52
00:02:30,720 --> 00:02:33,300
a lot of people were at home already but

53
00:02:33,300 --> 00:02:36,060
uh I'm surprised how many people are

54
00:02:36,060 --> 00:02:37,800
still here

55
00:02:37,800 --> 00:02:40,200
um well the capture the flag

56
00:02:40,200 --> 00:02:44,400
Mr CTF Chef nice so I've heard

57
00:02:44,400 --> 00:02:46,560
um all right first a couple of nice

58
00:02:46,560 --> 00:02:48,440
stats we had

59
00:02:48,440 --> 00:02:51,900
129 people registered for the CTF so

60
00:02:51,900 --> 00:02:53,640
that's a lot considering the number of

61
00:02:53,640 --> 00:02:55,260
people that are here

62
00:02:55,260 --> 00:02:56,580
um

63
00:02:56,580 --> 00:03:00,360
over a total of 61 teams so that's also

64
00:03:00,360 --> 00:03:02,340
a lot of teams also a lot of loan moves

65
00:03:02,340 --> 00:03:04,620
but also a lot of really competitive

66
00:03:04,620 --> 00:03:05,900
teams of

67
00:03:05,900 --> 00:03:09,360
exactly five people or less in every

68
00:03:09,360 --> 00:03:12,180
case no exceptions

69
00:03:12,180 --> 00:03:15,019
maybe uh

70
00:03:15,019 --> 00:03:20,720
you could have eventually scored 600 206

71
00:03:20,720 --> 00:03:24,239
200 and 94 points and that's a weird

72
00:03:24,239 --> 00:03:26,400
number because we do weird math with the

73
00:03:26,400 --> 00:03:28,500
points but that's the number we ended up

74
00:03:28,500 --> 00:03:29,760
at

75
00:03:29,760 --> 00:03:31,080
um

76
00:03:31,080 --> 00:03:35,840
there was a total of 271 right Flags so

77
00:03:35,840 --> 00:03:39,180
271 challenge dissolved in two days

78
00:03:39,180 --> 00:03:43,980
that's uh also a lot but also 300 and 87

79
00:03:43,980 --> 00:03:46,140
people who submitted wrong answers so

80
00:03:46,140 --> 00:03:48,000
shave on you for submitting wrong

81
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:49,080
answers

82
00:03:49,080 --> 00:03:51,900
or we built a challenge wrong and you

83
00:03:51,900 --> 00:03:54,900
well it was it was definitely not our

84
00:03:54,900 --> 00:03:57,080
fault

85
00:03:57,720 --> 00:03:59,340
the challenge that was solved the most

86
00:03:59,340 --> 00:04:01,319
was ransomware alert one of our forensic

87
00:04:01,319 --> 00:04:03,720
challenges so good job everyone who did

88
00:04:03,720 --> 00:04:06,840
that but especially good job to the

89
00:04:06,840 --> 00:04:08,940
single team that solved angry robot

90
00:04:08,940 --> 00:04:10,860
noises

91
00:04:10,860 --> 00:04:13,680
that who had exactly one solve and then

92
00:04:13,680 --> 00:04:15,840
there were a few other challenges which

93
00:04:15,840 --> 00:04:17,418
were also apparently really hard

94
00:04:17,418 --> 00:04:19,500
including the word puzzle the auto

95
00:04:19,500 --> 00:04:22,199
puzzle hoodie and

96
00:04:22,199 --> 00:04:24,780
a few crypto challenges

97
00:04:24,780 --> 00:04:28,320
and that's a

98
00:04:28,320 --> 00:04:31,740
our CTF in a couple of stats

99
00:04:31,740 --> 00:04:35,940
so now the prices yeah

100
00:04:37,500 --> 00:04:39,900

101

um first of all I would like to say

186
00:09:21,360 --> 00:09:23,459
thank you it was an absolute honor to be

187
00:09:23,459 --> 00:09:26,700
here as a sponsor again this year

188
00:09:26,700 --> 00:09:29,100
um we've really enjoyed all the

189
00:09:29,100 --> 00:09:32,100
merrymand the Fantastic talks and all

190
00:09:32,100 --> 00:09:33,660
the other initiatives that have taken

191
00:09:33,660 --> 00:09:35,580
place over the last three years uh three

192
00:09:35,580 --> 00:09:37,560
days

193
00:09:37,560 --> 00:09:40,500
um it felt like three years That's how

194
00:09:40,500 --> 00:09:43,019
little sleep I've had

195
00:09:43,019 --> 00:09:43,740
um

196
00:09:43,740 --> 00:09:46,980
this year we did the puzzle placement uh

197
00:09:46,980 --> 00:09:50,760
which uh was mostly credit of Boss who

198
00:09:50,760 --> 00:09:52,740
you just saw in the second place for the

199
00:09:52,740 --> 00:09:55,560
nfar uh CTF

200
00:09:55,560 --> 00:10:00,060
um and based on the approximately 20

201
00:10:00,060 --> 00:10:02,220
responses we got

202
00:10:02,220 --> 00:10:04,320
most of the questions were fairly easy

203
00:10:04,320 --> 00:10:07,800
with the exception of 2B which dumped

204
00:10:07,800 --> 00:10:09,480
most people

205
00:10:09,480 --> 00:10:12,600
um which was because the answer for that

206
00:10:12,600 --> 00:10:14,760
question wasn't actually on the place

207
00:10:14,760 --> 00:10:17,640
mat but was hidden in plain sight as a

208
00:10:17,640 --> 00:10:20,279
chameleon within the hotel one of our

209
00:10:20,279 --> 00:10:21,360
posters

210
00:10:21,360 --> 00:10:24,180
which had the cipher you needed to solve

211
00:10:24,180 --> 00:10:25,019
that challenge

212
00:10:25,019 --> 00:10:28,500
in total we had three people who

213
00:10:28,500 --> 00:10:29,880
um solved it

214
00:10:29,880 --> 00:10:33,899
of which one was by far the fastest

215
00:10:33,899 --> 00:10:36,899
um and uh based on that I would like to

216
00:10:36,899 --> 00:10:39,300
give that person the 3D printer we have

217
00:10:39,300 --> 00:10:41,100
here

218
00:10:41,100 --> 00:10:43,140
um and I don't have a real name but I do

219
00:10:43,140 --> 00:10:46,079
have an acronym BS and I've done

220
00:10:46,079 --> 00:10:48,240
two-factor authentication so I already

221
00:10:48,240 --> 00:10:51,079
know who it is

222
00:10:52,860 --> 00:10:57,060

we we um we know that was a potential

233
00:11:38,100 --> 00:11:40,800
issue and we kept track of that but the

234
00:11:40,800 --> 00:11:43,200
difference between soft times was so

235
00:11:43,200 --> 00:11:46,380
high that it didn't really matter

236
00:11:46,380 --> 00:11:47,940
um

237
00:11:47,940 --> 00:11:51,120

00:13:08,160 --> 00:13:10,800
informal

267
00:13:10,800 --> 00:13:13,380
so again some house rules again

268
00:13:13,380 --> 00:13:15,660
leave your bedding in the hallway if you

269
00:13:15,660 --> 00:13:17,459

270
00:13:17,459 --> 00:13:20,459
seven so you can stay in there but all

271
00:13:20,459 --> 00:13:22,620
the bedding in the Bungalows please put

272
00:13:22,620 --> 00:13:24,300
it in the hallway

273
00:13:24,300 --> 00:13:26,459
7 pm

274
00:13:26,459 --> 00:13:28,320
please don't forget your keys every year

275
00:13:28,320 --> 00:13:30,240
I get phone calls of people in distress

276
00:13:30,240 --> 00:13:32,639
for getting the keys

277
00:13:32,639 --> 00:13:35,360
so drop them at the reception and please

278
00:13:35,360 --> 00:13:38,399
say your Bungalow number that helps them

279
00:13:38,399 --> 00:13:41,399
and then then they know you're gone

280
00:13:41,399 --> 00:13:43,200
so thank you for that already if you

281
00:13:43,200 --> 00:13:46,519
want to follow those lines

282
00:13:47,339 --> 00:13:49,800
I have an update on the clothing

283
00:13:49,800 --> 00:13:52,380
lots of people requested more clothing

284
00:13:52,380 --> 00:13:55,320
we did an extra round it was

285
00:13:55,320 --> 00:13:58,560
also sold out within 55 minutes actually

286
00:13:58,560 --> 00:14:00,300
people were still asleep and then they

287
00:14:00,300 --> 00:14:02,459
were already sold out

288
00:14:02,459 --> 00:14:05,579
again people had issues being in time

289
00:14:05,579 --> 00:14:07,440
and other people were like oh and then I

290
00:14:07,440 --> 00:14:08,760
order and then they lost their

291
00:14:08,760 --> 00:14:10,860
opportunity

292
00:14:10,860 --> 00:14:12,000
um

293
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:13,560
next time we will do that differently

294
00:14:13,560 --> 00:14:15,380
that's uh that's good feedback for me

295
00:14:15,380 --> 00:14:18,060
the the closing supplier I can label

296
00:14:18,060 --> 00:14:20,339
Frankie said oh man you could sold

297
00:14:20,339 --> 00:14:22,380
double and I think he's right so next

298
00:14:22,380 --> 00:14:24,839
year we will start earlier and we'll

299
00:14:24,839 --> 00:14:26,760
design some awesome hoodie again we have

300
00:14:26,760 --> 00:14:28,560
already great ideas

301
00:14:28,560 --> 00:14:32,100
and I can label really helps us putting

302
00:14:32,100 --> 00:14:35,040
those crazy ideas and turn them into

303
00:14:35,040 --> 00:14:36,300
reality

304
00:14:36,300 --> 00:14:39,120
so uh I will work and do my best to

305
00:14:39,120 --> 00:14:41,399
create an awesome hoodie so you can

306
00:14:41,399 --> 00:14:44,040
either trust me and buy it in advance or

307
00:14:44,040 --> 00:14:46,019
you think I screw it up and wait and

308
00:14:46,019 --> 00:14:49,620
then miss out maybe but that's up to you

309
00:14:49,620 --> 00:14:51,600
um but I will promise you that we were

310
00:14:51,600 --> 00:14:53,519
going to work on something awesome and

311
00:14:53,519 --> 00:14:56,279
yeah we will have them in the shop and

312
00:14:56,279 --> 00:14:58,079
we'll make sure they are here in time

313
00:14:58,079 --> 00:15:00,899
and everybody that wants one can get

314
00:15:00,899 --> 00:15:02,639
them so that's what I learned from this

315
00:15:02,639 --> 00:15:03,899
experience

316
00:15:03,899 --> 00:15:06,899
and uh yeah probably some fake hacker

317
00:15:06,899 --> 00:15:08,940
Hotel merchandise might pop up that

318
00:15:08,940 --> 00:15:12,620
would be really crediting to my work but

319
00:15:13,019 --> 00:15:15,839
saw me fence and the hoodies the extra

320
00:15:15,839 --> 00:15:18,240
50 ones will be made they're made in

321
00:15:18,240 --> 00:15:19,139
Turkey

322
00:15:19,139 --> 00:15:21,180
we all know the situation there

323
00:15:21,180 --> 00:15:23,339
so please bear with me I'm not sure how

324
00:15:23,339 --> 00:15:25,620
the company is affected or the suppliers

325
00:15:25,620 --> 00:15:26,760
over there

326
00:15:26,760 --> 00:15:28,560
so I think there are more important

327
00:15:28,560 --> 00:15:30,480
things there now than your hoodies to be

328
00:15:30,480 --> 00:15:33,180
honest but I will make sure you get them

329
00:15:33,180 --> 00:15:34,680
please

330
00:15:34,680 --> 00:15:36,660
um if it takes a little longer I hope

331
00:15:36,660 --> 00:15:40,100
you do all understand why

332
00:15:41,399 --> 00:15:44,940
then thanking all the sponsors

333
00:15:44,940 --> 00:15:46,980
again as I said in my clothes in the

334
00:15:46,980 --> 00:15:49,320
opening talk without them an event like

335
00:15:49,320 --> 00:15:50,940
this is not possible

336
00:15:50,940 --> 00:15:55,139
your lunches are paid by them

337
00:15:55,139 --> 00:15:58,560
um all the the batch is paid by them all

338
00:15:58,560 --> 00:16:00,839
the experts we have the goodies all the

339
00:16:00,839 --> 00:16:02,880

391
00:18:13,080 --> 00:18:14,880

00:22:50,179 --> 00:22:54,600
foreign people that are actually always

506
00:22:54,600 --> 00:22:56,159
in the background

507
00:22:56,159 --> 00:22:57,900
but I really want to mention them

508
00:22:57,900 --> 00:22:59,340
because they're always there when it's

509
00:22:59,340 --> 00:23:01,440
about batch sponsoring or giving

510
00:23:01,440 --> 00:23:03,419
Electronics advice or helping the team

511
00:23:03,419 --> 00:23:05,520
out he did so in the past with with

512
00:23:05,520 --> 00:23:08,039
soldering eyes or extra equipment the

513
00:23:08,039 --> 00:23:10,200
batch team needed so that's a Michael

514
00:23:10,200 --> 00:23:13,620
station from station Electronics

515
00:23:13,620 --> 00:23:17,039
and also our main sponsor

516
00:23:17,039 --> 00:23:19,799
and they've separately sponsored also

517
00:23:19,799 --> 00:23:21,600
the batch so that's going to be said

518
00:23:21,600 --> 00:23:23,340
okay then you can also have the key code

519
00:23:23,340 --> 00:23:25,200
you're the main sponsor that was a

520
00:23:25,200 --> 00:23:27,419
coincidence but it's really awesome so

521
00:23:27,419 --> 00:23:28,919
again thanks to Ronald and his team

522
00:23:28,919 --> 00:23:31,799
really really cool

523
00:23:31,799 --> 00:23:34,799
foreign

524
00:23:38,960 --> 00:23:42,120
space biddler but he's also one of the

525
00:23:42,120 --> 00:23:44,340
two or three founding members of events

526
00:23:44,340 --> 00:23:47,039
together with Wilco they always do the

527
00:23:47,039 --> 00:23:50,640
event stuff during CCC doing MCA did

528
00:23:50,640 --> 00:23:52,860
they always connect up high gigabit

529
00:23:52,860 --> 00:23:54,720
connections so you can have fun in a

530
00:23:54,720 --> 00:23:56,940
camp you're in a camp field 200 gigabits

531
00:23:56,940 --> 00:23:59,640
to a field it's insane these guys just

532
00:23:59,640 --> 00:24:01,320
walk around and when people complain oh

533
00:24:01,320 --> 00:24:03,720
my Wi-Fi is a bit wacky here they just

534
00:24:03,720 --> 00:24:05,400
ran out and give you access point to

535
00:24:05,400 --> 00:24:07,559
hang in your hotel room the hotel always

536
00:24:07,559 --> 00:24:09,840
tells me well you guys have here the

537
00:24:09,840 --> 00:24:12,120
Wi-Fi is better than when you're gone so

538
00:24:12,120 --> 00:24:13,980
that's saying something so give it up

539
00:24:13,980 --> 00:24:16,620
for event infra this this world what are

540
00:24:16,620 --> 00:24:19,039
you talking about

541
00:24:21,539 --> 00:24:23,700
and then last but certain certain

542
00:24:23,700 --> 00:24:25,200
certainly not least

543
00:24:25,200 --> 00:24:26,820
because if they weren't here you

544
00:24:26,820 --> 00:24:28,620
wouldn't see me you wouldn't hear me you

545
00:24:28,620 --> 00:24:30,539
wouldn't see me at home you wouldn't see

546
00:24:30,539 --> 00:24:32,100
the recordings afterwards to show to

547
00:24:32,100 --> 00:24:33,720
your colleagues please give it up for

548
00:24:33,720 --> 00:24:37,039
foxit of State for kids

549
00:24:40,799 --> 00:24:42,960
amazing setup how they do it with all

550
00:24:42,960 --> 00:24:44,100
the lights all the stuff they're

551
00:24:44,100 --> 00:24:46,679
bringing I'm still amazed every time and

552
00:24:46,679 --> 00:24:49,200
I'm glad that they are here to support

553
00:24:49,200 --> 00:24:52,440
us with the event

554
00:24:52,440 --> 00:24:54,840
social network stats this come from the

555
00:24:54,840 --> 00:24:56,400
from the dashboard it's always running

556
00:24:56,400 --> 00:24:59,340
during our events you can see here the

557
00:24:59,340 --> 00:25:02,100
number of connections the the number of

558
00:25:02,100 --> 00:25:04,559
traffic so there's a

559
00:25:04,559 --> 00:25:06,179
you can see here great amounts of

560
00:25:06,179 --> 00:25:08,880
traffic the hotel has now a one gigabit

561
00:25:08,880 --> 00:25:10,320
internet connection

562
00:25:10,320 --> 00:25:12,480
and these guys managed to have all the

563
00:25:12,480 --> 00:25:14,220
streams going out and you guys all be

564
00:25:14,220 --> 00:25:16,440
able to download stuff or watch movies

565
00:25:16,440 --> 00:25:18,840
or whatever you want to do it's really

566
00:25:18,840 --> 00:25:20,039
nice

567
00:25:20,039 --> 00:25:20,760
um

568
00:25:20,760 --> 00:25:22,440
yeah you can see the Ping is three

569
00:25:22,440 --> 00:25:24,419
milliseconds which I think is really

570
00:25:24,419 --> 00:25:26,159
cool we have transferred a lot of

571
00:25:26,159 --> 00:25:29,400
traffic as you can see 1.1 terabyte

572
00:25:29,400 --> 00:25:31,740
so yeah I'm really glad and you can see

573
00:25:31,740 --> 00:25:33,960
the network is really rocking and thanks

574
00:25:33,960 --> 00:25:38,419
again event infra and ion for doing this

575
00:25:42,200 --> 00:25:46,580
oh gospels hello

576
00:25:46,679 --> 00:25:49,260

okay oh these are oh These are nice so

578
00:25:52,080 --> 00:25:54,360
next to the sheets I have an extra slide

579
00:25:54,360 --> 00:25:57,779
here which is from the Cars post called

580
00:25:57,779 --> 00:26:00,480
my is here with your friends and doing

581
00:26:00,480 --> 00:26:04,020
cars post I received the request if we

582
00:26:04,020 --> 00:26:07,080
wanted cars post really late actually in

583
00:26:07,080 --> 00:26:09,659
before organizing it just a few weeks

584
00:26:09,659 --> 00:26:10,620
ago

585
00:26:10,620 --> 00:26:13,559
and I knew it was it was there and it

586
00:26:13,559 --> 00:26:15,900
existed but actually during one of the

587
00:26:15,900 --> 00:26:18,240
other events where I just tried it and

588
00:26:18,240 --> 00:26:20,159
it really works you can just

589
00:26:20,159 --> 00:26:22,980
say I think I have the card here

590
00:26:22,980 --> 00:26:26,039
I told someone if you write bold small

591
00:26:26,039 --> 00:26:28,620
fat guy organizing hacker Hotel it will

592
00:26:28,620 --> 00:26:30,779
reach me

593
00:26:30,779 --> 00:26:32,580
and the card is here so my proof is

594
00:26:32,580 --> 00:26:33,539
there

595
00:26:33,539 --> 00:26:36,919
it just works it's amazing

596
00:26:36,919 --> 00:26:39,299
there's actually someone I think only

597
00:26:39,299 --> 00:26:41,340
wrote two names so are we still looking

598
00:26:41,340 --> 00:26:42,539
for them

599
00:26:42,539 --> 00:26:44,520
there's two names can I name the names

600
00:26:44,520 --> 00:26:47,299
or not

601
00:26:49,740 --> 00:26:51,299
okay

602
00:26:51,299 --> 00:26:53,700
okay so the person wrote some Chinese

603
00:26:53,700 --> 00:26:56,100
message I'm not I can't read it but

604
00:26:56,100 --> 00:26:57,960
there was a card with Chinese message to

605
00:26:57,960 --> 00:27:00,659
address to two persons in Berlin if you

606
00:27:00,659 --> 00:27:02,220
were the one sending that please contact

607
00:27:02,220 --> 00:27:04,440
we will make sure it gets there but we

608
00:27:04,440 --> 00:27:06,840
need a little help but that's really

609
00:27:06,840 --> 00:27:08,400
cool so Casper you can just write

610
00:27:08,400 --> 00:27:10,620
something on it and they just drop it to

611
00:27:10,620 --> 00:27:12,360
the people at the conference and I hope

612
00:27:12,360 --> 00:27:14,100
that they will be back next time again

613
00:27:14,100 --> 00:27:16,140
because I really liked it and we have

614
00:27:16,140 --> 00:27:19,500
some uh closing statistics which is

615
00:27:19,500 --> 00:27:21,240
really cool on their cards they have

616
00:27:21,240 --> 00:27:23,220
these awesome cards and you can always

617
00:27:23,220 --> 00:27:26,159
donate them to them because yeah these

618
00:27:26,159 --> 00:27:27,720
cards they cost money to make and I like

619
00:27:27,720 --> 00:27:29,760
the ID it's it's totally crazy and it

620
00:27:29,760 --> 00:27:33,620
fits the event so in total there were 48

621
00:27:33,620 --> 00:27:36,059
postcards that were sent

622
00:27:36,059 --> 00:27:38,520
to the outside world into nine different

623
00:27:38,520 --> 00:27:40,919
countries

624
00:27:40,919 --> 00:27:43,820
and they were internally sent they were

625
00:27:43,820 --> 00:27:46,919

627
00:27:49,200 --> 00:27:53,039
will be levered at the speed of Chaos

628
00:27:53,039 --> 00:27:54,960
and then they thank me for the amazing

629
00:27:54,960 --> 00:27:56,700
event but I want to return the favor

630
00:27:56,700 --> 00:27:59,220

thank you thank you so much

634
00:28:07,800 --> 00:28:11,820
[Applause]

635
00:28:11,820 --> 00:28:13,440
then the club Martin that's really

636
00:28:13,440 --> 00:28:15,840
special as I said yesterday we ran

637
00:28:15,840 --> 00:28:20,360
through 30 crates I've made in one day

638
00:28:20,360 --> 00:28:23,460
we order with our hacker space biddler

639
00:28:23,460 --> 00:28:25,080
and we thought like oh we bring half of

640
00:28:25,080 --> 00:28:27,779
it here well there was another run but

641
00:28:27,779 --> 00:28:30,840
the uh yeah you say the demographics of

642
00:28:30,840 --> 00:28:33,120
Marta drinkers is different on hacker

643
00:28:33,120 --> 00:28:34,679
Hotel than in our space in our space

644
00:28:34,679 --> 00:28:37,080
it's mostly flora and cannot the red

645
00:28:37,080 --> 00:28:40,020
Mata and here everybody wants zero

646
00:28:40,020 --> 00:28:42,799
I wonder why is that and normal matter

647
00:28:42,799 --> 00:28:45,120
so there was a big difference and we had

648
00:28:45,120 --> 00:28:46,799
like lots of red left with no normal

649
00:28:46,799 --> 00:28:48,960
Mountain next year I will try to do that

650
00:28:48,960 --> 00:28:51,120
better so that's also good feedback but

651
00:28:51,120 --> 00:28:52,440
there's still matter

652
00:28:52,440 --> 00:28:54,539
so we didn't run out but maybe your

653
00:28:54,539 --> 00:28:58,620
favorite flavor was uh was gone

654
00:28:58,620 --> 00:29:02,760
but we had 24 crates of matter in 2020.

655
00:29:02,760 --> 00:29:04,980
actually we had 30 but I left with six

656
00:29:04,980 --> 00:29:07,620
so we used up 24.

657
00:29:07,620 --> 00:29:09,539
and now

658
00:29:09,539 --> 00:29:12,539
okay

659
00:29:13,440 --> 00:29:15,360
so there are some people that really

660
00:29:15,360 --> 00:29:18,000
really drink this stuff so that was

661
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:19,140
really cool

662
00:29:19,140 --> 00:29:21,659
and it's now all gone I hear I thought I

663
00:29:21,659 --> 00:29:23,100
saw some bottles but okay

664
00:29:23,100 --> 00:29:25,380
so you did well and next year I will

665
00:29:25,380 --> 00:29:26,880
make sure there's more Martha and also

666
00:29:26,880 --> 00:29:28,980
in different quantities and whatever but

667
00:29:28,980 --> 00:29:30,720
we'll make it work yeah thanks for your

668
00:29:30,720 --> 00:29:32,580
great feedback to improve also there

669
00:29:32,580 --> 00:29:34,740
already during the event thank you so

670

707
00:31:07,799 --> 00:31:09,480
okay we're going to help you out tell us

708
00:31:09,480 --> 00:31:12,419
what we have to do there's like 250 of

709
00:31:12,419 --> 00:31:14,580
these black chairs in this room

710
00:31:14,580 --> 00:31:17,220
we needed 400 so they dragged all the

711
00:31:17,220 --> 00:31:19,440
chairs up on the cards these heavy

712
00:31:19,440 --> 00:31:21,899
chairs 80 of them were on the other side

713
00:31:21,899 --> 00:31:25,140
they were drug here the tables that are

714
00:31:25,140 --> 00:31:27,000
on the other side they were here so they

715
00:31:27,000 --> 00:31:29,600
were drugged there

716
00:31:29,760 --> 00:31:33,179
so please it when we finish up we're not

717
00:31:33,179 --> 00:31:34,200
done yet

718
00:31:34,200 --> 00:31:36,779
I would really really like to I was

719
00:31:36,779 --> 00:31:40,140
hoping if 80 people could lift the black

720
00:31:40,140 --> 00:31:43,020
chair and bring it to the other side to

721
00:31:43,020 --> 00:31:45,539
the heck room that would be amazing that

722
00:31:45,539 --> 00:31:47,220
will save these guys three to four hours

723
00:31:47,220 --> 00:31:49,559
of work going in the elevator dropping

724
00:31:49,559 --> 00:31:51,720
10 chairs by time and walking them all

725
00:31:51,720 --> 00:31:52,500
over

726
00:31:52,500 --> 00:31:54,539
and I think if you use the power of

727
00:31:54,539 --> 00:31:56,700
hackers the power of our community and

728
00:31:56,700 --> 00:31:59,279
if you can they are a bit heavy so I'm

729
00:31:59,279 --> 00:32:01,500
not please don't feel forced to do it

730
00:32:01,500 --> 00:32:03,419
but if you can leave the chair and you

731
00:32:03,419 --> 00:32:04,860
can walk it to the heck room that would

732
00:32:04,860 --> 00:32:05,820
be

733
00:32:05,820 --> 00:32:08,600
amazing

734
00:32:09,720 --> 00:32:12,419
so again thanks to all sponsors

735
00:32:12,419 --> 00:32:16,020
thanks for after my second request not

736
00:32:16,020 --> 00:32:17,880
making it really any worse I will have

737
00:32:17,880 --> 00:32:19,440
to see later on how much we have to

738
00:32:19,440 --> 00:32:21,000
remove some people are already helping

739
00:32:21,000 --> 00:32:24,539

740
00:32:24,539 --> 00:32:26,820

741
00:32:26,820 --> 00:32:28,140
the work and

742
00:32:28,140 --> 00:32:29,760
some people came to me after the bad

743
00:32:29,760 --> 00:32:31,500
stock and they really didn't realize how

744
00:32:31,500 --> 00:32:33,600
much work went into this what story is

745
00:32:33,600 --> 00:32:36,120
behind it how much these crazy creative

746
00:32:36,120 --> 00:32:38,279
minds do so also the batch team thanks

747
00:32:38,279 --> 00:32:40,919
again really really awesome

748
00:32:40,919 --> 00:32:42,659
the network team I mentioned them they

749
00:32:42,659 --> 00:32:46,080
do a great job keep the stuff running

750
00:32:46,080 --> 00:32:48,600
the hotel and staff they really really

751
00:32:48,600 --> 00:32:50,640
have worked extremely hard

752
00:32:50,640 --> 00:32:53,220
they they made special dinners for

753
00:32:53,220 --> 00:32:55,559
people that have food allergies they try

754
00:32:55,559 --> 00:32:59,100
to fix everything we was broken quickly

755
00:32:59,100 --> 00:33:01,260
as possible

756
00:33:01,260 --> 00:33:03,659
um we did a new approach last time in

757
00:33:03,659 --> 00:33:05,700
2020 I sent them a list these people are

758
00:33:05,700 --> 00:33:06,419
coming

759
00:33:06,419 --> 00:33:08,580
and you guys you have to make up your

760
00:33:08,580 --> 00:33:10,980
mind because then you're bringing a

761
00:33:10,980 --> 00:33:12,360
friend and then you're not and then

762
00:33:12,360 --> 00:33:13,919
you're bringing five new friends and you

763
00:33:13,919 --> 00:33:15,299
need a bigger Bungalow and a smaller

764
00:33:15,299 --> 00:33:17,640
Bungalow and I kept sending them updates

765
00:33:17,640 --> 00:33:20,159
and we just checked it yesterday and I

766
00:33:20,159 --> 00:33:21,720
started with fruition one and in the end

767
00:33:21,720 --> 00:33:24,000
before the event started we had 46

768
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:26,159
versions of the list and it was changing

769
00:33:26,159 --> 00:33:27,440
around

770
00:33:27,440 --> 00:33:29,940
rooms to the Bungalows Bungalows to

771
00:33:29,940 --> 00:33:32,580
split up into rooms and yes I do that

772
00:33:32,580 --> 00:33:34,500
sometimes myself as well to help you

773
00:33:34,500 --> 00:33:36,120
guys and accommodate you and your group

774
00:33:36,120 --> 00:33:38,460
of friends to to know you had a room

775
00:33:38,460 --> 00:33:40,019
well are you now for Bungalow you can

776
00:33:40,019 --> 00:33:41,519
invite more people

777
00:33:41,519 --> 00:33:43,919
so and this hotel was flexible enough

778
00:33:43,919 --> 00:33:46,200
this time we went a little different I

779
00:33:46,200 --> 00:33:48,059
just sent them a list they made a bill I

780
00:33:48,059 --> 00:33:50,460
paid a bill and then we had one document

781
00:33:50,460 --> 00:33:52,620
and we kept on scratching that so I had

782
00:33:52,620 --> 00:33:54,600
to pay a lot of extra money for all the

783
00:33:54,600 --> 00:33:56,700
extras but it is really easy and makes

784
00:33:56,700 --> 00:33:59,460
work so much nicer so I really want to

785
00:33:59,460 --> 00:34:01,380
express my thanks to the hotel and staff

786
00:34:01,380 --> 00:34:03,419
and especially the general manager

787
00:34:03,419 --> 00:34:06,480
Daniela and lisanna who is the reception

788
00:34:06,480 --> 00:34:07,679
the lady at the reception desk

789
00:34:07,679 --> 00:34:09,418
coordinating everything with your

790
00:34:09,418 --> 00:34:11,820
colleagues so I hope you all have the

791
00:34:11,820 --> 00:34:14,460
same good experience and I really would

792
00:34:14,460 --> 00:34:18,060
like to have a big hand for the hotel

793
00:34:18,060 --> 00:34:21,060
foreign

794
00:34:28,080 --> 00:34:31,080
this is the QR code and it's really it

795
00:34:31,080 --> 00:34:32,399
was triggered all over the place and

796
00:34:32,399 --> 00:34:34,139
everybody's like I'm a hacker I'm not

797
00:34:34,139 --> 00:34:36,300
scanning that it's probably a reg roll

798
00:34:36,300 --> 00:34:38,940
even when it says it's not but this is

799
00:34:38,940 --> 00:34:41,339
the code to the Mastodon server and as

800
00:34:41,339 --> 00:34:44,280
some people at least two of you missed

801
00:34:44,280 --> 00:34:45,899

00:36:01,320 --> 00:36:04,260
easiest way for that is that I just will

836
00:36:04,260 --> 00:36:06,000
offer you all the people that are

837
00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:08,460
present here on the event I will offer

838
00:36:08,460 --> 00:36:10,380
you all a first chance of buying a

839
00:36:10,380 --> 00:36:12,300
ticket for next year

840
00:36:12,300 --> 00:36:14,780
foreign

841
00:36:17,120 --> 00:36:21,029
[Applause]

842
00:36:21,980 --> 00:36:25,140
that will mean that of course I will get

843
00:36:25,140 --> 00:36:26,880
some flag of people that can't make it

844
00:36:26,880 --> 00:36:29,760
and maybe some of you were like okay I

845
00:36:29,760 --> 00:36:31,920
really loved it I saw it and I'm gone

846
00:36:31,920 --> 00:36:35,460
some sort of funny free off or

847
00:36:35,460 --> 00:36:37,619
something I'm gonna be nice I saw I came

848
00:36:37,619 --> 00:36:40,619
ashore and I off but I hope I'd

849
00:36:40,619 --> 00:36:43,440
see everyone next year here again

850
00:36:43,440 --> 00:36:45,960
um so you guys will receive some sort of

851
00:36:45,960 --> 00:36:48,359
Link or I'll think about it how to do it

852
00:36:48,359 --> 00:36:51,119
before the official shop opens that will

853
00:36:51,119 --> 00:36:53,640
mean like last year that the webshop

854
00:36:53,640 --> 00:36:55,260
opens with probably one or two rooms in

855
00:36:55,260 --> 00:36:58,079
one Bungalow so I'm not sure who's going

856
00:36:58,079 --> 00:37:00,119
to get those but it will be a lot

857
00:37:00,119 --> 00:37:03,119
massive bloody massacre

858
00:37:03,119 --> 00:37:04,980
so

859
00:37:04,980 --> 00:37:06,960
probably in the next two weeks I will

860
00:37:06,960 --> 00:37:09,359
send out this link

861
00:37:09,359 --> 00:37:11,700
and I

862
00:37:11,700 --> 00:37:13,619
um I know that not everyone is like

863
00:37:13,619 --> 00:37:15,780
bulking with money some people have to

864
00:37:15,780 --> 00:37:17,640
save up to be here which I really really

865
00:37:17,640 --> 00:37:20,280
appreciate so just place your body if

866
00:37:20,280 --> 00:37:22,440
you receive my link do your order if you

867
00:37:22,440 --> 00:37:24,900
don't have the money now it will come I

868
00:37:24,900 --> 00:37:26,400
Won't Wait For

869
00:37:26,400 --> 00:37:29,040
Eternity but at least probably let's say

870
00:37:29,040 --> 00:37:31,500
I don't know summer or something so you

871
00:37:31,500 --> 00:37:33,420
get the link you order if you don't want

872
00:37:33,420 --> 00:37:35,640
to pay yet don't do it if you have the

873
00:37:35,640 --> 00:37:37,859
money please it helps the event rolling

874
00:37:37,859 --> 00:37:39,960
but if you don't you just accept that

875
00:37:39,960 --> 00:37:42,359
and say just do bank transfer and then

876
00:37:42,359 --> 00:37:43,800
probably I will start nagging you in a

877
00:37:43,800 --> 00:37:45,240
few months and saying hey you need to

878
00:37:45,240 --> 00:37:46,859
pay up

879
00:37:46,859 --> 00:37:48,960
and if you then don't then I can always

880
00:37:48,960 --> 00:37:50,820
sell your room onwards but at least you

881
00:37:50,820 --> 00:37:52,980
had the opportunity to be the first to

882
00:37:52,980 --> 00:37:55,380
be here again because yeah you are

883
00:37:55,380 --> 00:37:57,420
awesome and I really would like to see

884
00:37:57,420 --> 00:38:02,119
you back so that's that's how it is

885
00:38:06,359 --> 00:38:09,000
it says 25 of many as I said I didn't

886
00:38:09,000 --> 00:38:10,980
make my slides so I'll just keep going

887
00:38:10,980 --> 00:38:13,380
and when I see these keywords no no

888
00:38:13,380 --> 00:38:15,480
we're almost there I think but this is

889
00:38:15,480 --> 00:38:17,520
really important my big hero Ken Block

890
00:38:17,520 --> 00:38:20,339
spoke to you and asked you to not be an

891
00:38:20,339 --> 00:38:23,460
 and you didn't so I'm so glad

892
00:38:23,460 --> 00:38:25,680
for that and thank you so much for being

893
00:38:25,680 --> 00:38:27,839
excellent to each other

894
00:38:27,839 --> 00:38:30,740
foreign

895
00:38:33,180 --> 00:38:35,579
you are now one of the first to hear

896
00:38:35,579 --> 00:38:37,859
when the next event will be it will be 9

897
00:38:37,859 --> 00:38:40,440
to 11 of February

898
00:38:40,440 --> 00:38:43,020
that is a special date because as it

899
00:38:43,020 --> 00:38:45,180
seems now and I will have it confirmed

900
00:38:45,180 --> 00:38:46,680
by the hotel that will mean that we have

901
00:38:46,680 --> 00:38:48,420
full access to all the rooms on the

902
00:38:48,420 --> 00:38:50,520
Friday like this year but this year we

903
00:38:50,520 --> 00:38:52,740
didn't really make use of it which was

904
00:38:52,740 --> 00:38:55,859
also a new thing I learned from this

905
00:38:55,859 --> 00:38:56,760
um

906
00:38:56,760 --> 00:38:59,040
because we didn't talk about it last

907
00:38:59,040 --> 00:39:02,040
year the last time sorry 2020 the Dutch

908
00:39:02,040 --> 00:39:05,160
tax Authority the yeah they kind of ran

909
00:39:05,160 --> 00:39:07,920
down the doors and charge you people

910
00:39:07,920 --> 00:39:09,780
they have trainings in this hotel as

911
00:39:09,780 --> 00:39:11,940
well and then

912
00:39:11,940 --> 00:39:13,560
um they were still using some rooms and

913
00:39:13,560 --> 00:39:15,480
I was under the impression that it was

914
00:39:15,480 --> 00:39:16,920
the same this year

915
00:39:16,920 --> 00:39:19,619
so now I have confirmation that they are

916
00:39:19,619 --> 00:39:22,020
not in on the Friday so we will do some

917
00:39:22,020 --> 00:39:24,660
workshop on Friday as well and that will

918
00:39:24,660 --> 00:39:26,280
hopefully address

919
00:39:26,280 --> 00:39:28,500
my friend Bart's question which he sent

920
00:39:28,500 --> 00:39:31,200
on the postcard and he said

921
00:39:31,200 --> 00:39:34,220
more days of hacker Hotel four or five

922
00:39:34,220 --> 00:39:36,240
you already have the opportunity

923
00:39:36,240 --> 00:39:38,040
commonly on the Thursday and you can

924
00:39:38,040 --> 00:39:40,260
leave on the Monday that's already there

925
00:39:40,260 --> 00:39:43,680
but I will also make sure that we have a

926
00:39:43,680 --> 00:39:45,660
interesting program on the Friday

927
00:39:45,660 --> 00:39:47,460
already so you can maybe do some lock

928
00:39:47,460 --> 00:39:49,740
picking Workshop impressioning workshops

929
00:39:49,740 --> 00:39:52,320
Electronics workshops maybe the bleach

930
00:39:52,320 --> 00:39:54,540
of moon the creative workshops making

931
00:39:54,540 --> 00:39:57,240
resin or maybe a new workshop she comes

932
00:39:57,240 --> 00:39:59,040
up I hope she comes back because she

933
00:39:59,040 --> 00:40:01,200
does great workshops but at least then

934
00:40:01,200 --> 00:40:02,880
there is something to do

935
00:40:02,880 --> 00:40:06,060
on the uh on the Friday afternoon

936
00:40:06,060 --> 00:40:08,040
already show you and if you have the

937
00:40:08,040 --> 00:40:09,839
extras you can come in on the Thursday

938
00:40:09,839 --> 00:40:12,540
already maybe help out or not just relax

939
00:40:12,540 --> 00:40:15,000
and then the next Friday morning you go

940
00:40:15,000 --> 00:40:16,320
to the breakfast and then you go

941
00:40:16,320 --> 00:40:17,820
straight on to the event

942
00:40:17,820 --> 00:40:19,440
so

943
00:40:19,440 --> 00:40:23,960
we're extending it in some way then

944
00:40:26,099 --> 00:40:29,520
and then I would like to close up

945
00:40:29,520 --> 00:40:31,260
that I cannot do this alone and every

946
00:40:31,260 --> 00:40:33,359
every time I get better better than this

947
00:40:33,359 --> 00:40:35,280
I had a great conversation with some

948
00:40:35,280 --> 00:40:37,740
people of Schubert and Chantal

949
00:40:37,740 --> 00:40:40,079
and and saying okay you know what's

950
00:40:40,079 --> 00:40:41,700
what's different now

951
00:40:41,700 --> 00:40:44,119
and I think it's only fair to say that

952
00:40:44,119 --> 00:40:46,740
Mendel are people that if you ask them

953
00:40:46,740 --> 00:40:49,619
something they will make sure it happens

954
00:40:49,619 --> 00:40:52,079
and when you know that when you did it

955
00:40:52,079 --> 00:40:54,540
once or twice and that happens that you

956
00:40:54,540 --> 00:40:55,619
think okay

957
00:40:55,619 --> 00:40:58,260
they can take care of they can get

958
00:40:58,260 --> 00:41:00,240
they have business they will take stuff

959
00:41:00,240 --> 00:41:02,880
out of my hands

960
00:41:02,880 --> 00:41:05,040
then you trust them and trust is really

961
00:41:05,040 --> 00:41:06,480
something in our community which is

962
00:41:06,480 --> 00:41:08,339
important but also when you organize

963
00:41:08,339 --> 00:41:10,560
events like this I don't want to ruin it

964
00:41:10,560 --> 00:41:13,020
I want to give you the best experience

965
00:41:13,020 --> 00:41:14,099
possible

966
00:41:14,099 --> 00:41:15,839
and if you don't have people that help

967
00:41:15,839 --> 00:41:18,720
you and you see hey I can let go

968
00:41:18,720 --> 00:41:22,020
and it helps so they helped grow me but

969
00:41:22,020 --> 00:41:24,480
also grow the event

970
00:41:24,480 --> 00:41:27,119
I'm way more relaxed and I'm not even

971
00:41:27,119 --> 00:41:29,040
tired this gives me so much energy I'm

972
00:41:29,040 --> 00:41:31,260
so psyched up

973
00:41:31,260 --> 00:41:32,820
sorry

974
00:41:32,820 --> 00:41:34,680
and I have an audible voice thanks for

975
00:41:34,680 --> 00:41:38,040
the compliment yes so thanks for some

976
00:41:38,040 --> 00:41:40,820

um I would like to ask all those

989
00:42:10,079 --> 00:42:12,599

991

00:42:32,640 --> 00:42:34,680
I will do this not only with little help

1001
00:42:34,680 --> 00:42:37,380
of my friends but I will also do this

1002
00:42:37,380 --> 00:42:38,760
with a little help of my connected

1003
00:42:38,760 --> 00:42:39,780
friends

1004
00:42:39,780 --> 00:42:42,000
so I have some connection blocks because

1005
00:42:42,000 --> 00:42:43,740
people say do these cables really work

1006
00:42:43,740 --> 00:42:46,980
we have ion here with this analyzer so I

1007
00:42:46,980 --> 00:42:50,040
want to hook up here storm so give it up

1008
00:42:50,040 --> 00:42:53,420
for Tom people this is Tom

1009
00:42:53,579 --> 00:42:56,160
Tom is wearing

1010
00:42:56,160 --> 00:42:58,500
Thomas wearing uh Thomas wearing an

1011
00:42:58,500 --> 00:43:00,839
analyze Network analyzer I thought it

1012
00:43:00,839 --> 00:43:03,480
was like okay plug in one we test plugin

1013
00:43:03,480 --> 00:43:05,040
two and test but the test takes a little

1014
00:43:05,040 --> 00:43:07,400
longer because it's a very high-tech

1015
00:43:07,400 --> 00:43:10,500
analyzer so what we'll do I first asked

1016
00:43:10,500 --> 00:43:12,540
chantala Mendel to join me because

1017
00:43:12,540 --> 00:43:14,900
that's free

1018
00:43:14,900 --> 00:43:17,040
Mendela so

1019
00:43:17,040 --> 00:43:19,079
three was already done so I will try

1020
00:43:19,079 --> 00:43:21,180
four and we'll see if we can have four

1021
00:43:21,180 --> 00:43:23,760
together I'm not sure if it's working I

1022
00:43:23,760 --> 00:43:26,040
kept hanging on those cables but we did

1023
00:43:26,040 --> 00:43:28,920
three but then it's not only with a

1024
00:43:28,920 --> 00:43:30,960
little help of my friends but also my

1025
00:43:30,960 --> 00:43:33,359
connected friends and then so if we have

1026
00:43:33,359 --> 00:43:35,280
one more

1027
00:43:35,280 --> 00:43:36,960
oh you're already duplicating it there

1028
00:43:36,960 --> 00:43:39,359
oh no let's try it let's try it though

1029
00:43:39,359 --> 00:43:41,460

1030
00:43:41,460 --> 00:43:42,900

1102
00:47:09,359 --> 00:47:12,119
hoodies inside out so

1103
00:47:12,119 --> 00:47:14,760
do them the other way around zip them up

1104
00:47:14,760 --> 00:47:16,440
from the inside put the cables on the

1105
00:47:16,440 --> 00:47:17,880
inside that won't damage your machine

1106
00:47:17,880 --> 00:47:19,980
then and then you will have the longest

1107

1108
