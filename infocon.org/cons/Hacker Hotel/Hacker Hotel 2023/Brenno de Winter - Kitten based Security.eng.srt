1
00:00:00,299 --> 00:00:02,100
It immediately starts with a correction nothing

2
00:00:02,100 --> 00:00:05,400
brenno It's eh Keiko ennuh look Where

3
00:00:05,400 --> 00:00:07,740
has a story to tell

4
00:00:07,740 --> 00:00:09,660
look how the columnist for ICT

5
00:00:09,660 --> 00:00:12,900
Magazine and ehm She starts by

6
00:00:12,900 --> 00:00:15,059
explaining first something about

7
00:00:15,059 --> 00:00:16,800
infections disease because we're going to talk a

8
00:00:16,800 --> 00:00:20,240
bit about Corona  and ehm

9
00:00:20,240 --> 00:00:23,340
experiences from the er past Eh who the

10
00:00:23,340 --> 00:00:24,720
sometimes a guarantee for the future

11
00:00:24,720 --> 00:00:26,340
namely infection I see to have a

12
00:00:26,340 --> 00:00:28,980
few characteristics one person infect

13
00:00:28,980 --> 00:00:31,199
two people two people infect four

14
00:00:31,199 --> 00:00:33,899
people four people infect 16 people

15
00:00:33,899 --> 00:00:36,300
and you could call this an exponential effect

16
00:00:36,300 --> 00:00:38,640
and  that also means

17
00:00:38,640 --> 00:00:40,500
that if your measurere is there that if you

18
00:00:40,500 --> 00:00:42,899
want to do something eh that the

19
00:00:42,899 --> 00:00:44,520
longer you get it gets complicated and that's

20
00:00:44,520 --> 00:00:46,860
why we

21
00:00:46,860 --> 00:00:48,719
said to each other more than 100 years ago after the

22
00:00:48,719 --> 00:00:52,559
Spanish flu um it's a eh point

23
00:00:52,559 --> 00:00:54,420
of  people

24
00:00:54,420 --> 00:00:58,860
eh that the government is taking measures and

25
00:00:58,860 --> 00:01:00,539
I start saying this because

26
00:01:00,539 --> 00:01:03,059
very often I get the question why I

27
00:01:03,059 --> 00:01:06,299
participate in this

28
00:01:06,299 --> 00:01:09,000
because it concerns Human rights because we

29
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:10,560
have the right to be protected

30
00:01:10,560 --> 00:01:13,740
against disease and that is laid down in

31
00:01:13,740 --> 00:01:15,840
several treaties

32
00:01:15,840 --> 00:01:17,880
so  whether the government likes it or

33
00:01:17,880 --> 00:01:21,540
not this they should do well then the interpreter

34
00:01:21,540 --> 00:01:24,119
that is going to take place based on

35
00:01:24,119 --> 00:01:27,479
four cat feet um the first part

36
00:01:27,479 --> 00:01:29,299
is about cats in a Ministry

37
00:01:29,299 --> 00:01:31,880
then about cat based security

38
00:01:31,880 --> 00:01:34,320
then the cat bells that

39
00:01:34,320 --> 00:01:36,659
took place at hekka hotel  today and

40
00:01:36,659 --> 00:01:37,860
those are quite a few very

41
00:01:37,860 --> 00:01:40,320
special things eh and then we're going to

42
00:01:40,320 --> 00:01:42,680
talk about the litter box

43
00:01:42,680 --> 00:01:46,140
good cats at a Ministry you see a

44
00:01:46,140 --> 00:01:48,600
picture of my workplace a while

45
00:01:48,600 --> 00:01:51,000
ago right after I

46
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:52,439
came in Am I right 10 purple

47
00:01:52,439 --> 00:01:54,600
crocodiles  bought because we I am yes

48
00:01:54,600 --> 00:01:56,820
something with information security so the

49
00:01:56,820 --> 00:02:00,659
purple crocodiles department erm

50
00:02:00,659 --> 00:02:02,220
good thing it all didn't start That's where It

51
00:02:02,220 --> 00:02:05,399
all started in eh March

52
00:02:05,399 --> 00:02:08,399
2020 eh when we all had to

53
00:02:08,399 --> 00:02:10,919
stay home We weren't allowed to go anywhere because it

54
00:02:10,919 --> 00:02:12,840
had to be safe and see what's up after

55
00:02:12,840 --> 00:02:14,940
watching television and he sees the man

56
00:02:14,940 --> 00:02:16,620
with a beard

57
00:02:16,620 --> 00:02:18,780
and the man with a beard is talking about

58
00:02:18,780 --> 00:02:21,239
two things There will be two apps we are

59
00:02:21,239 --> 00:02:25,379
talking April 6, 2020 1 app intended to

60
00:02:25,379 --> 00:02:27,540
tell contacts you no longer

61
00:02:27,540 --> 00:02:30,060
know or remember

62
00:02:30,060 --> 00:02:32,580
Hey  you have been in contact with me eh

63
00:02:32,580 --> 00:02:34,560


64
00:02:34,560 --> 00:02:36,599
And you are now at risk because I have

65
00:02:36,599 --> 00:02:38,420
tested positive,

66
00:02:38,420 --> 00:02:40,620
incidentally, he is quite often in the department

67
00:02:40,620 --> 00:02:42,180
and we always send each other

68
00:02:42,180 --> 00:02:44,870
cards with step Positive eh

69
00:02:44,870 --> 00:02:46,800
[Music]

70
00:02:46,800 --> 00:02:49,920
the 2nd app is um support of  the

71
00:02:49,920 --> 00:02:53,220
Source and contact investigation of the GGD

72
00:02:53,220 --> 00:02:54,900
because the annoying thing is when things

73
00:02:54,900 --> 00:02:57,540
increase exponentially, then the

74
00:02:57,540 --> 00:03:00,300
workload also increases exponentially with

75
00:03:00,300 --> 00:03:03,540
a dwindling number of people because

76
00:03:03,540 --> 00:03:05,340
those people also turn out not to be in coin

77
00:03:05,340 --> 00:03:07,200
for Corona

78
00:03:07,200 --> 00:03:10,500
Well I eh saw all that dirt on  the

79
00:03:10,500 --> 00:03:12,420
television I heard that man

80
00:03:12,420 --> 00:03:15,060
outside telling things about

81
00:03:15,060 --> 00:03:17,159
measuring exact distances based on Bluetooth

82
00:03:17,159 --> 00:03:20,360
and stuff Well that Yes good joke

83
00:03:20,360 --> 00:03:23,720
so I'm very focal about it Sorry

84
00:03:23,720 --> 00:03:26,940
No I had tested this morning so

85
00:03:26,940 --> 00:03:29,480
again I didn't have anything positive Ehm

86
00:03:29,480 --> 00:03:32,459
followed by an appeton  where all

87
00:03:32,459 --> 00:03:34,680
companies that had in the solution

88
00:03:34,680 --> 00:03:36,720
were allowed to show their scam around their solution

89
00:03:36,720 --> 00:03:38,120


90
00:03:38,120 --> 00:03:41,340
750 companies

91
00:03:41,340 --> 00:03:44,180
and they all had a characteristic in common

92
00:03:44,180 --> 00:03:46,799
neither could offer a decent solution

93
00:03:46,799 --> 00:03:48,239


94
00:03:48,239 --> 00:03:53,040
or they were unsafe or they were privacy

95
00:03:53,040 --> 00:03:57,360
unfriendly or it was a joke

96
00:03:57,360 --> 00:03:59,879
or the software was okay  written but

97
00:03:59,879 --> 00:04:01,739
did not function

98
00:04:01,739 --> 00:04:05,159
or a combination of these

99
00:04:05,159 --> 00:04:08,819
two apps that were already on the market in the

100
00:04:08,819 --> 00:04:12,959
Czech Republic and Austria and Singapore and

101
00:04:12,959 --> 00:04:16,019
after this exercise the Ministry of

102
00:04:16,019 --> 00:04:18,238
Foreign Affairs was able to tell that these

103
00:04:18,238 --> 00:04:20,339
countries had better take their app off the market

104
00:04:20,339 --> 00:04:21,779
and they are also  taken off the market

105
00:04:21,779 --> 00:04:24,840
so I started it myself I thought

106
00:04:24,840 --> 00:04:26,699
that was a really fantastic

107
00:04:26,699 --> 00:04:29,220
meeting by the way I thought it was too much wrong with

108
00:04:29,220 --> 00:04:32,040
the Techno optimism

109
00:04:32,040 --> 00:04:34,740
because man man man It seemed to be subscribed

110
00:04:34,740 --> 00:04:36,620
to somewhere but good

111
00:04:36,620 --> 00:04:40,139
then someone called me and

112
00:04:40,139 --> 00:04:42,660
said stop whining  and no help if you

113
00:04:42,660 --> 00:04:44,580
know it all so well yourself but yes

114
00:04:44,580 --> 00:04:47,580
I don't want to be a dinosaur so yes

115
00:04:47,580 --> 00:04:49,800
just don't participate so I had

116
00:04:49,800 --> 00:04:51,479
thought of a few things that this would never

117
00:04:51,479 --> 00:04:55,919
happen the first is ehm these kinds of apps

118
00:04:55,919 --> 00:04:57,300
are going to be abused So there

119
00:04:57,300 --> 00:04:59,340
really has to be  just uh abuse is

120
00:04:59,340 --> 00:05:02,160
punished needs to be regulated so uh i

121
00:05:02,160 --> 00:05:03,360
said yes then you should actually write a law

122
00:05:03,360 --> 00:05:05,639
to punish people

123
00:05:05,639 --> 00:05:08,759
if they use the app for something else

124
00:05:08,759 --> 00:05:11,280
and the first thing the Ciao said is Oh yes

125
00:05:11,280 --> 00:05:13,880
is good Let's do

126
00:05:14,220 --> 00:05:17,040
Yes  but then we put privacy

127
00:05:17,040 --> 00:05:18,660
protection and information security

128
00:05:18,660 --> 00:05:20,580
first

129
00:05:20,580 --> 00:05:24,180
Yes logically fine we will do Yes and we will

130
00:05:24,180 --> 00:05:26,220
ensure that it is accessible so eh

131
00:05:26,220 --> 00:05:27,840
if that is not there, that thing will not come on

132
00:05:27,840 --> 00:05:30,960
the market Okay um fine Go ahead and make it

133
00:05:30,960 --> 00:05:33,180
Oh then make it  we made it transparent So

134
00:05:33,180 --> 00:05:35,880
everyone can see everything well

135
00:05:35,880 --> 00:05:37,820
the answer was again to that go ahead

136
00:05:37,820 --> 00:05:41,280
they do everything is open can open well and

137
00:05:41,280 --> 00:05:42,479
that for the Ministry of

138
00:05:42,479 --> 00:05:44,220
Health was not the very first thing

139
00:05:44,220 --> 00:05:46,080
I expected

140
00:05:46,080 --> 00:05:48,479
so I showed a picture of myself

141
00:05:48,479 --> 00:05:52,979
make for the government pass and eh now

142
00:05:52,979 --> 00:05:54,900
got to work I'm going to spare you the whole

143
00:05:54,900 --> 00:05:56,699
story because then I can

144
00:05:56,699 --> 00:05:59,820
give a lecture of 3 hours um what

145
00:05:59,820 --> 00:06:02,340
he most important is who poops her

146
00:06:02,340 --> 00:06:05,520
Money where all was so if for

147
00:06:05,520 --> 00:06:07,199
example um

148
00:06:07,199 --> 00:06:10,139
Google has a mistake  made in the

149
00:06:10,139 --> 00:06:12,840
framework that was under the crown reporter

150
00:06:12,840 --> 00:06:16,500
and we hear that from Finland we get

151
00:06:16,500 --> 00:06:19,100
the app for the eh for the from the market,

152
00:06:19,100 --> 00:06:21,240
we did the exercise with

153
00:06:21,240 --> 00:06:23,819
How throw someone under the bus that's called a

154
00:06:23,819 --> 00:06:26,400
letter to parliament Google has a problem we

155
00:06:26,400 --> 00:06:28,440
take  accountability they

156
00:06:28,440 --> 00:06:31,020
screwed something up we are doing this now and we have

157
00:06:31,020 --> 00:06:32,580


158
00:06:32,580 --> 00:06:34,620
had regular reports from the market for two days that is really scary because

159
00:06:34,620 --> 00:06:36,960
that can be the end of the product Anyway we did

160
00:06:36,960 --> 00:06:39,060
it and just how

161
00:06:39,060 --> 00:06:40,860
difficult is it done because

162
00:06:40,860 --> 00:06:43,259
you see  already at the ministry Well the meeting

163
00:06:43,259 --> 00:06:46,220
lasted less than a minute

164
00:06:46,560 --> 00:06:48,660
well everyone joins in everyone

165
00:06:48,660 --> 00:06:50,280
could see everything

166
00:06:50,280 --> 00:06:52,740
ehm You have to think about that, we

167
00:06:52,740 --> 00:06:54,720
learned because if you publish a design

168
00:06:54,720 --> 00:06:56,819
then Dagblad De

169
00:06:56,819 --> 00:06:58,979
Limburger thinks that the ehm product is already finished

170
00:06:58,979 --> 00:07:02,039
the coronemelder  is already done

171
00:07:02,039 --> 00:07:04,800
we hadn't thought this through

172
00:07:04,800 --> 00:07:06,539
well well we actually

173
00:07:06,539 --> 00:07:09,180
made everything public eh from bronco designs

174
00:07:09,180 --> 00:07:12,539
but also the discussion also the ethical

175
00:07:12,539 --> 00:07:14,900
research and ehm

176
00:07:14,900 --> 00:07:17,220
I was sometimes asked if I

177
00:07:17,220 --> 00:07:19,199
had gone mad

178
00:07:19,199 --> 00:07:23,819
that sure yes people absolutely  right in

179
00:07:23,819 --> 00:07:28,699
the source coat reviews and the pen test

180
00:07:28,740 --> 00:07:32,099
Well I was cold inside or the NOS comes

181
00:07:32,099 --> 00:07:35,699
with him very nice story namely

182
00:07:35,699 --> 00:07:38,479
the rfm erm was sensitive to

183
00:07:38,479 --> 00:07:41,400
url manipulation so I asked Ron the

184
00:07:41,400 --> 00:07:44,039
complete objective questions do

185
00:07:44,039 --> 00:07:47,039
n't you wear in this house  pen tests and

186
00:07:47,039 --> 00:07:48,479
then a pen test was neatly

187
00:07:48,479 --> 00:07:51,180
delivered and there was a neat

188
00:07:51,180 --> 00:07:53,819
list of errors, something similar

189
00:07:53,819 --> 00:07:57,060
I saw later and that year at

190
00:07:57,060 --> 00:07:58,460
Hoe van Twente

191
00:07:58,460 --> 00:08:01,319
because the pen test actually turned out

192
00:08:01,319 --> 00:08:03,360
not to contain what had been

193
00:08:03,360 --> 00:08:06,419
tested, so

194
00:08:06,419 --> 00:08:09,300
this in  the nighter it

195
00:08:09,300 --> 00:08:12,000
was clear to me that I cannot send these kinds of panthes

196
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:13,440
to the House of Representatives,

197
00:08:13,440 --> 00:08:17,419
so what you will do then is to

198
00:08:17,419 --> 00:08:19,979
set uniform requirements for purchasing,

199
00:08:19,979 --> 00:08:23,240
namely I want your standards

200
00:08:23,240 --> 00:08:26,699
to run out completely and I want to see proof

201
00:08:26,699 --> 00:08:29,160
that you have delivered that.  of

202
00:08:29,160 --> 00:08:32,039
penters companies Yes and if we do

203
00:08:32,039 --> 00:08:34,020
n't do that properly then we are certainly

204
00:08:34,020 --> 00:08:35,539
also liable

205
00:08:35,539 --> 00:08:38,219
oh yes

206
00:08:38,219 --> 00:08:41,940
second your report will be published

207
00:08:41,940 --> 00:08:45,540
and sent to the House of Representatives

208
00:08:45,540 --> 00:08:47,279
well then you lost a number of providers again

209
00:08:47,279 --> 00:08:50,220
and it could be that I

210
00:08:50,220 --> 00:08:52,500
order is in the market twice so it

211
00:08:52,500 --> 00:08:53,940
could be that the Competitor

212
00:08:53,940 --> 00:08:57,120
gets the same software from you to test

213
00:08:57,120 --> 00:09:00,420
and if you miss something your

214
00:09:00,420 --> 00:09:01,920
competitor could therefore publish it

215
00:09:01,920 --> 00:09:04,140
not at stop well then you are

216
00:09:04,140 --> 00:09:05,580
part again Well then the  rinse a

217
00:09:05,580 --> 00:09:07,920
bit thinner

218
00:09:07,920 --> 00:09:10,140
and also the way you

219
00:09:10,140 --> 00:09:12,000
write it down that must be nominated

220
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:15,060
according to the pentest execution Standard and

221
00:09:15,060 --> 00:09:17,580
ehm yes I think that is normal and everything

222
00:09:17,580 --> 00:09:19,320
must be reproducible you must be able to

223
00:09:19,320 --> 00:09:22,640
prove that you have done this

224
00:09:22,680 --> 00:09:26,180
what is behind the idea here

225
00:09:26,180 --> 00:09:29,519
you cannot use a list of errors

226
00:09:29,519 --> 00:09:31,320
to prove that it is

227
00:09:31,320 --> 00:09:33,600
working properly a list of errors is

228
00:09:33,600 --> 00:09:36,240
proof that something is not working properly

229
00:09:36,240 --> 00:09:38,100
if you want proof that something

230
00:09:38,100 --> 00:09:41,959
is working properly I will have to see what has been tested

231
00:09:42,360 --> 00:09:45,540
you actually test the security  controls

232
00:09:45,540 --> 00:09:47,940
on design, existence and operation just like

233
00:09:47,940 --> 00:09:49,500
an order does in all other

234
00:09:49,500 --> 00:09:51,740
things

235
00:09:53,160 --> 00:09:55,040
and that's what we started

236
00:09:55,040 --> 00:09:58,320
testing the design existence and operation

237
00:09:58,320 --> 00:10:01,200
of a skurty measure control and also to

238
00:10:01,200 --> 00:10:03,300
this day that's what we do also in

239
00:10:03,300 --> 00:10:05,599
term

240
00:10:05,820 --> 00:10:09,540
every time  prove again that you

241
00:10:09,540 --> 00:10:14,599
walk out of everything very drowsy no matter how it is

242
00:10:14,760 --> 00:10:16,980
and then you still don't catch everything but you do

243
00:10:16,980 --> 00:10:20,000
catch a lot of things

244
00:10:21,540 --> 00:10:23,519
because with a car we don't say Yes

245
00:10:23,519 --> 00:10:25,680
I got my MOT and this was what

246
00:10:25,680 --> 00:10:28,519
was wrong

247
00:10:29,519 --> 00:10:33,200
and then came Daniel Verlaan

248
00:10:33,540 --> 00:10:36,360
We had Corona test streets

249
00:10:36,360 --> 00:10:39,320
and he cracked a

250
00:10:39,320 --> 00:10:43,200
Corona test street and very quickly

251
00:10:43,200 --> 00:10:46,860
the second chamber called It's ridiculous

252
00:10:46,860 --> 00:10:49,380
that the Minister of Health

253
00:10:49,380 --> 00:10:52,560
doesn't test these companies and voila

254
00:10:52,560 --> 00:10:56,459
we had 70 panthers to

255
00:10:56,459 --> 00:10:59,820
do extra ourselves for a while  long story short

256
00:10:59,820 --> 00:11:01,079
You can't market this properly

257
00:11:01,079 --> 00:11:04,819
Hold on to this for a moment

258
00:11:05,279 --> 00:11:09,180
we're going back to December 2020 How van

259
00:11:09,180 --> 00:11:14,459
Twente went it's December 15th and eh I

260
00:11:14,459 --> 00:11:17,060
'm eh at lunch

261
00:11:17,060 --> 00:11:19,140
pretty much the only department that is

262
00:11:19,140 --> 00:11:20,760
in the cafeteria by the way  was allowed to sit That

263
00:11:20,760 --> 00:11:23,600
was cool again

264
00:11:23,700 --> 00:11:26,459
and I was still really sincere in my opinion

265
00:11:26,459 --> 00:11:29,940
two injections and then it's done then

266
00:11:29,940 --> 00:11:31,920
the work pressure road Then we just get on

267
00:11:31,920 --> 00:11:35,100
with our lives and in eh We had the

268
00:11:35,100 --> 00:11:36,920
containers on the border with Belgium

269
00:11:36,920 --> 00:11:39,899
France did  complicated Austria

270
00:11:39,899 --> 00:11:41,700
was planning to guard the borders a bit more

271
00:11:41,700 --> 00:11:43,860
strictly So everyone

272
00:11:43,860 --> 00:11:46,620
understood if you were vaccinated Then

273
00:11:46,620 --> 00:11:48,839
you will have to register this so I

274
00:11:48,839 --> 00:11:51,540
actually had a small question eh Does

275
00:11:51,540 --> 00:11:55,140
anyone know how we register this and at

276
00:11:55,140 --> 00:11:57,120
that moment one person starts  to chat

277
00:11:57,120 --> 00:11:59,399
about Yes but that is what the hospitals do in

278
00:11:59,399 --> 00:12:02,339
the epd and I see Ron Roosendaal

279
00:12:02,339 --> 00:12:05,640
there is Ciao turning pale and

280
00:12:05,640 --> 00:12:07,440
it was okay here we have no

281
00:12:07,440 --> 00:12:08,940
solution for

282
00:12:08,940 --> 00:12:11,519
the GPs epds could not handle this

283
00:12:11,519 --> 00:12:13,560
because

284
00:12:13,560 --> 00:12:16,500
There is no solution by the way the poster

285
00:12:16,500 --> 00:12:18,060
that  you see it actually

286
00:12:18,060 --> 00:12:19,920
hung in an academic hospital but

287
00:12:19,920 --> 00:12:22,339
that's another story

288
00:12:22,339 --> 00:12:25,980
so he got a lot of chatter

289
00:12:25,980 --> 00:12:27,420
and I just

290
00:12:27,420 --> 00:12:29,579
went to call some fence spacers

291
00:12:29,579 --> 00:12:32,479
because um

292
00:12:32,760 --> 00:12:35,940
I know but this was when this was not

293
00:12:35,940 --> 00:12:37,740


294
00:12:37,740 --> 00:12:40,320
exactly at the time Okay just

295
00:12:40,320 --> 00:12:42,740
be historically correct

296
00:12:44,820 --> 00:12:48,300
Henk We started calling people

297
00:12:48,300 --> 00:12:51,420
because ehm this was December 15th and if

298
00:12:51,420 --> 00:12:53,820
you remember the vaccination

299
00:12:53,820 --> 00:12:56,240
campaigns will start on January 8th

300
00:12:56,240 --> 00:13:00,980
let's say a little 3 weeks later

301
00:13:01,320 --> 00:13:03,720
you can't save long can

302
00:13:03,720 --> 00:13:05,279
pick up a very long story but

303
00:13:05,279 --> 00:13:07,980
with purchasing you won't make it with people

304
00:13:07,980 --> 00:13:09,480
who have to get used to each other you wo

305
00:13:09,480 --> 00:13:11,579
n't make it so yes you just have to

306
00:13:11,579 --> 00:13:14,399
call people and say do you have

307
00:13:14,399 --> 00:13:16,440
time now and if the answer is no say then

308
00:13:16,440 --> 00:13:18,420
the next question is what to do now

309
00:13:18,420 --> 00:13:20,160
doing it is more important than Corona

310
00:13:20,160 --> 00:13:23,399
No then you work for me that's how I

311
00:13:23,399 --> 00:13:25,079
started to bring in Anne Jan

312
00:13:25,079 --> 00:13:27,138


313
00:13:27,180 --> 00:13:30,240
who was reasonably quiet and so a

314
00:13:30,240 --> 00:13:31,380
lot of beautiful people all

315
00:13:31,380 --> 00:13:33,980
came in

316
00:13:34,139 --> 00:13:37,500
and the here and there came weird posters and

317
00:13:37,500 --> 00:13:40,800
stickers and on  the soap dispensers in the

318
00:13:40,800 --> 00:13:41,380
toilets

319
00:13:41,380 --> 00:13:46,650
[Laughter]

320
00:13:46,980 --> 00:13:50,279
You can imagine we

321
00:13:50,279 --> 00:13:52,680
were sitting on the floor of the department

322
00:13:52,680 --> 00:13:57,240
And sports and PGB and the least of PGB

323
00:13:57,240 --> 00:13:59,160
sometimes came to the office they

324
00:13:59,160 --> 00:14:02,300
found us complicated

325
00:14:04,920 --> 00:14:06,839
well and then comes at a certain point

326
00:14:06,839 --> 00:14:09,420
a manager passes by

327
00:14:09,420 --> 00:14:11,639
and you are typing an email and

328
00:14:11,639 --> 00:14:14,760
back to December 15th, hey,

329
00:14:14,760 --> 00:14:18,060
the country is in Lockdown and if it is not

330
00:14:18,060 --> 00:14:19,860
going to be vaccinated, the broad

331
00:14:19,860 --> 00:14:23,160
assessment of the services is that

332
00:14:23,160 --> 00:14:26,040
riots will break out on the street So this

333
00:14:26,040 --> 00:14:27,660
is not a software project  become a bit

334
00:14:27,660 --> 00:14:30,360
overdue because then you have

335
00:14:30,360 --> 00:14:34,019
riots on the street and buildings on fire

336
00:14:34,019 --> 00:14:36,060
And a man like that comes in and

337
00:14:36,060 --> 00:14:38,639
says Maybe Defense will

338
00:14:38,639 --> 00:14:40,740
vaccinate to which I think Okay I have to

339
00:14:40,740 --> 00:14:42,600
scale up in volume Maybe we should have

340
00:14:42,600 --> 00:14:44,459
a million  being able to register shots per day

341
00:14:44,459 --> 00:14:47,579
more service more iron no

342
00:14:47,579 --> 00:14:49,199
problem

343
00:14:49,199 --> 00:14:51,480
no

344
00:14:51,480 --> 00:14:54,540
if Defense is going to vaccinate his

345
00:14:54,540 --> 00:14:55,459
thoughts

346
00:14:55,459 --> 00:14:58,019
then the project must have a code name

347
00:14:58,019 --> 00:14:59,480


348
00:14:59,480 --> 00:15:02,760
so anything he could have said

349
00:15:02,760 --> 00:15:05,360
well

350
00:15:05,399 --> 00:15:08,040
when I think of the Fancy I think of

351
00:15:08,040 --> 00:15:10,740
cool Ukrainian soldiers who  saving kitties

352
00:15:10,740 --> 00:15:13,040


353
00:15:16,620 --> 00:15:19,139
from tough people who at least

354
00:15:19,139 --> 00:15:22,800
do things with cats or the

355
00:15:22,800 --> 00:15:24,600
secret weapons of defense that's just

356
00:15:24,600 --> 00:15:28,139
cats, everyone knows that

357
00:15:28,139 --> 00:15:31,680
So I told that man already taps eh

358
00:15:31,680 --> 00:15:33,420
to the e-mail without blinking or

359
00:15:33,420 --> 00:15:36,060
blushing then I call it  project brani

360
00:15:36,060 --> 00:15:39,360
bananai and he said that doesn't seem to me to be

361
00:15:39,360 --> 00:15:41,459
linked to a vaccination campaign That

362
00:15:41,459 --> 00:15:42,560
seems fine to me

363
00:15:42,560 --> 00:15:46,380
[Laughter]

364
00:15:49,440 --> 00:15:53,540
this Oh this is my cat brani I

365
00:15:53,540 --> 00:15:55,980
affectionately call it bani Banani and that's how it

366
00:15:55,980 --> 00:15:59,279
came about so I called Jan on I say

367
00:15:59,279 --> 00:16:01,199
Are you  already on the way to The Hague and that

368
00:16:01,199 --> 00:16:02,699
was the one

369
00:16:02,699 --> 00:16:05,100
I say jump into a supermarket

370
00:16:05,100 --> 00:16:07,160
take pictures of a rack of bananas

371
00:16:07,160 --> 00:16:11,160
erm the was also said The

372
00:16:11,160 --> 00:16:14,040
IP address cannot be traced back to

373
00:16:14,040 --> 00:16:16,680
erm eh to the Ministry so I

374
00:16:16,680 --> 00:16:18,180
called Freedom I say  just give me an

375
00:16:18,180 --> 00:16:21,600
ip address and a vps and then uh

376
00:16:21,600 --> 00:16:24,060
say this website became brani bananai the

377
00:16:24,060 --> 00:16:25,740
website for all your bananas and it will be

378
00:16:25,740 --> 00:16:29,180
opened soon fine there

379
00:16:29,180 --> 00:16:32,639
management department is reassured and we

380
00:16:32,639 --> 00:16:34,500
started building we started building a system

381
00:16:34,500 --> 00:16:36,079
what we  being to cats Pleasure

382
00:16:36,079 --> 00:16:39,300
uh of course microservices So you have

383
00:16:39,300 --> 00:16:40,920
part brani you have part Banani You

384
00:16:40,920 --> 00:16:42,360
have part watch You have part

385
00:16:42,360 --> 00:16:44,759
business already You have part hereo and hereo

386
00:16:44,759 --> 00:16:46,620
is for the external contacts and

387
00:16:46,620 --> 00:16:48,660
of course also in terms of crypto you just have this

388
00:16:48,660 --> 00:16:52,500
well thought out because for crypto

389
00:16:52,500 --> 00:16:54,480
we obviously have our crypto

390
00:16:54,480 --> 00:16:57,620
architect Mendel

391
00:16:57,959 --> 00:16:59,820
and Mandel and I have the same

392
00:16:59,820 --> 00:17:02,820
belief system keys are stored on an

393
00:17:02,820 --> 00:17:05,220
hsm so not a very complicated

394
00:17:05,220 --> 00:17:07,079
belief system problem only of eh

395
00:17:07,079 --> 00:17:09,660
hsms you don't order them today in

396
00:17:09,660 --> 00:17:11,579
will be delivered tomorrow because the tests are

397
00:17:11,579 --> 00:17:14,400
more expensive  sometimes two to three weeks

398
00:17:14,400 --> 00:17:17,640
and her is m is a hard far security

399
00:17:17,640 --> 00:17:20,880
modjole and that's like ehm Ron Roos well

400
00:17:20,880 --> 00:17:23,299
Once said a prison for

401
00:17:23,299 --> 00:17:26,099
security keys in which they are

402
00:17:26,099 --> 00:17:28,460
born and also to be converted again

403
00:17:28,460 --> 00:17:33,360
or the private Keys that live in the

404
00:17:33,360 --> 00:17:35,460
hcm  and never come out and were

405
00:17:35,460 --> 00:17:37,020
then people who said yes if we ca

406
00:17:37,020 --> 00:17:38,760
n't make it then just put it

407
00:17:38,760 --> 00:17:42,320
on a window server

408
00:17:43,740 --> 00:17:46,260
my reaction to that was to

409
00:17:46,260 --> 00:17:47,820
go to someone and say

410
00:17:47,820 --> 00:17:49,919
I don't want this person anymore until the vaccination

411
00:17:49,919 --> 00:17:52,100
campaign  in this building

412
00:17:52,100 --> 00:17:55,080
and ehm

413
00:17:55,080 --> 00:17:58,380
then I called Mendel from ehm gofix

414
00:17:58,380 --> 00:18:01,919
and eh Mendel who said yes ehm

415
00:18:01,919 --> 00:18:04,200
eh we could do that with Ubi Keys

416
00:18:04,200 --> 00:18:07,080
the next morning so I say

417
00:18:07,080 --> 00:18:11,000
Mendel Okay go build no

418
00:18:16,080 --> 00:18:17,820
and then you can still go there  nothing with it eh But

419
00:18:17,820 --> 00:18:19,380
okay eh

420
00:18:19,380 --> 00:18:22,260
so mendeld that eh he says no I'm

421
00:18:22,260 --> 00:18:24,000
not going to make that Why not Yes I've

422
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:29,240
already finished the code so um that was fixed

423
00:18:29,539 --> 00:18:34,559
and on January 2nd we had our own electoral heremony with the help of

424
00:18:34,559 --> 00:18:37,340
fat Willem van Gulik

425
00:18:37,340 --> 00:18:41,539
er three data centers

426
00:18:41,539 --> 00:18:44,340
so that we had everything correct and everything

427
00:18:44,340 --> 00:18:46,679
just worked on the basis of this only

428
00:18:46,679 --> 00:18:49,440
disadvantage the decipherment is longer but

429
00:18:49,440 --> 00:18:51,660
yes that is the problem of the rrm and

430
00:18:51,660 --> 00:18:53,220
not of us

431
00:18:53,220 --> 00:18:56,220
so the army played no role well not

432
00:18:56,220 --> 00:19:00,720
quite ehm you have 118 hospitals

433
00:19:00,720 --> 00:19:02,100
that have to  provided with credentials

434
00:19:02,100 --> 00:19:05,400
and they should actually

435
00:19:05,400 --> 00:19:07,140
be delivered as soon as possible

436
00:19:07,140 --> 00:19:10,080
well the deadline was from

437
00:19:10,080 --> 00:19:12,840
January 8 after January 6 so

438
00:19:12,840 --> 00:19:15,740
on January 5

439
00:19:16,140 --> 00:19:19,679
Defense was with us in the afternoon ehm to

440
00:19:19,679 --> 00:19:22,740
pick up envelopes and in the

441
00:19:22,740 --> 00:19:24,720
hour after that saw  you the first hospitals

442
00:19:24,720 --> 00:19:27,059
and also really comments and I'm

443
00:19:27,059 --> 00:19:30,120
not exaggerating the liberation has started well then

444
00:19:30,120 --> 00:19:31,440
we stood with a few people with

445
00:19:31,440 --> 00:19:34,140
tears in their eyes from poop We

446
00:19:34,140 --> 00:19:35,820
just made it

447
00:19:35,820 --> 00:19:38,760
that's only 3 or 4 2 days already called something

448
00:19:38,760 --> 00:19:40,940


449
00:19:42,240 --> 00:19:44,780
but yes

450
00:19:45,660 --> 00:19:48,660
the next problem

451
00:19:48,660 --> 00:19:51,720
ehm well yes solution

452
00:19:51,720 --> 00:19:54,720
if you serve 118 hospitals then

453
00:19:54,720 --> 00:19:56,220
you can call another trade association

454
00:19:56,220 --> 00:19:57,660
and say who would you

455
00:19:57,660 --> 00:19:59,220
give geddentials and then you just get

456
00:19:59,220 --> 00:20:00,840
a nice list with two people per

457
00:20:00,840 --> 00:20:02,340
hospitals and that's where the keys live

458
00:20:02,340 --> 00:20:06,260
but  yes for nursing homes and and eh

459
00:20:06,260 --> 00:20:08,220
retirement home it is a bit complicated

460
00:20:08,220 --> 00:20:11,760
especially nursing homes ehm we do not know

461
00:20:11,760 --> 00:20:13,799
exactly How many nursing homes there

462
00:20:13,799 --> 00:20:16,160
are in the Netherlands, there

463
00:20:16,880 --> 00:20:24,799
are between 700 and 1000 and 7

464
00:20:24,799 --> 00:20:28,080
so we have to roll out between

465
00:20:28,080 --> 00:20:32,039
2000 and 14,000 cadangials in a few

466
00:20:32,039 --> 00:20:34,879
weeks

467
00:20:36,600 --> 00:20:40,500
and how many will come  now that keys

468
00:20:40,500 --> 00:20:42,539
are issued or eh log in is

469
00:20:42,539 --> 00:20:46,200
handed over to a Daniel Verlaan

470
00:20:46,200 --> 00:20:48,660
and no matter how we turn or

471
00:20:48,660 --> 00:20:50,580
turn and we have hired companies

472
00:20:50,580 --> 00:20:51,660
that normally do things in

473
00:20:51,660 --> 00:20:53,940
counterterrorism and they had the

474
00:20:53,940 --> 00:20:55,380
most fantastic idea that they also

475
00:20:55,380 --> 00:20:57,539
made true  we came

476
00:20:57,539 --> 00:21:01,580
out together You're not going to fix this

477
00:21:01,580 --> 00:21:04,140


478
00:21:04,140 --> 00:21:06,539
Rolling out 14,000 credentials in a few weeks is just not possible well

479
00:21:06,539 --> 00:21:08,520
then she was someone again a very

480
00:21:08,520 --> 00:21:11,640
big mouth and a very long tail

481
00:21:11,640 --> 00:21:14,220
our crypto architect and he said then

482
00:21:14,220 --> 00:21:16,200
we use the Uzi pass  and he was

483
00:21:16,200 --> 00:21:18,480
immediately snubbed with that we already

484
00:21:18,480 --> 00:21:20,460
tried that implemented that

485
00:21:20,460 --> 00:21:23,240
takes half a year

486
00:21:24,780 --> 00:21:27,480
and then you still have nothing

487
00:21:27,480 --> 00:21:29,159
and then you are a million euros further

488
00:21:29,159 --> 00:21:32,100
that was on a Thursday

489
00:21:32,100 --> 00:21:34,260
On Tuesday we revealed the source code

490
00:21:34,260 --> 00:21:37,240
For the poetry project

491
00:21:37,240 --> 00:21:41,780
[Laughter] By the way,

492
00:21:41,780 --> 00:21:44,340
Tuesday night I had a complaint

493
00:21:44,340 --> 00:21:46,080
from github

494
00:21:46,080 --> 00:21:48,179
that maybe this could be

495
00:21:48,179 --> 00:21:49,919
interpreted differently so then we

496
00:21:49,919 --> 00:21:52,980
called some people at Microsoft saying well you

497
00:21:52,980 --> 00:21:54,539
shouldn't read it like that but something with

498
00:21:54,539 --> 00:21:56,940
critters telling me you and then they

499
00:21:56,940 --> 00:21:58,260
explained that and  then it was allowed to

500
00:21:58,260 --> 00:22:00,480
stay but then we had written our own

501
00:22:00,480 --> 00:22:02,400
code and then you could

502
00:22:02,400 --> 00:22:06,539
log in with the Uzi only to our system

503
00:22:06,539 --> 00:22:10,260
a few towards the 10,000 doctors have

504
00:22:10,260 --> 00:22:12,240
done that

505
00:22:12,240 --> 00:22:16,260
around and it just works and all

506
00:22:16,260 --> 00:22:18,179
those people had already been screened and now Hi

507
00:22:18,179 --> 00:22:21,539
suddenly a management couple of processes about

508
00:22:21,539 --> 00:22:25,080
good I already told you This was the model

509
00:22:25,080 --> 00:22:26,640
we started with

510
00:22:26,640 --> 00:22:29,220
look angry because yes look how the Zijko

511
00:22:29,220 --> 00:22:30,140
is stupid

512
00:22:30,140 --> 00:22:33,000
hereo and and brani were like

513
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:36,120
relax You know don't be so fat but

514
00:22:36,120 --> 00:22:38,400
good that was someone else  and that

515
00:22:38,400 --> 00:22:40,460
was us Nemo for present manager

516
00:22:40,460 --> 00:22:44,940
who thought cat names were also stupid

517
00:22:44,940 --> 00:22:48,000
Anne Jan had a solution for that

518
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:51,780
he started calling systems Harry because

519
00:22:51,780 --> 00:22:53,280
in the end we just put the software

520
00:22:53,280 --> 00:22:55,440
together

521
00:22:55,440 --> 00:22:58,020
and we started

522
00:22:58,020 --> 00:23:00,360
with Harry three four five six seven eight

523
00:23:00,360 --> 00:23:02,580
nine  -0 where the manager later started

524
00:23:02,580 --> 00:23:05,159
asking where Harry 1 and 2 had

525
00:23:05,159 --> 00:23:07,620
gone and we did get up with five people

526
00:23:07,620 --> 00:23:10,220


527
00:23:10,220 --> 00:23:13,500
and said that's a story we'd

528
00:23:13,500 --> 00:23:16,020
rather not talk about but we

529
00:23:16,020 --> 00:23:17,820
're disappointed that you

530
00:23:17,820 --> 00:23:20,480
apparently don't know Star Wars

531
00:23:21,840 --> 00:23:23,240
exactly

532
00:23:23,240 --> 00:23:26,039
and then of course we also had

533
00:23:26,039 --> 00:23:28,200
things that were complicated so ehm yes

534
00:23:28,200 --> 00:23:31,320
we called that Inge Inge 0

535
00:23:31,320 --> 00:23:34,140
to 9 and then Piet came there is

536
00:23:34,140 --> 00:23:36,480
no further logic behind Fortunately there was

537
00:23:36,480 --> 00:23:37,919
now a man without a beard who said

538
00:23:37,919 --> 00:23:40,200
at the demo about the fun  those

539
00:23:40,200 --> 00:23:42,240
cat names completely he suddenly thought that it was

540
00:23:42,240 --> 00:23:44,640
fun those cat

541
00:23:44,640 --> 00:23:46,380
names we keep them in and since then

542
00:23:46,380 --> 00:23:48,179
by order of the minister we

543
00:23:48,179 --> 00:23:50,039
just call every system neatly after cats

544
00:23:50,039 --> 00:23:52,740
and the first two systems that

545
00:23:52,740 --> 00:23:56,179
hot mustache and Mori well

546
00:23:56,460 --> 00:23:58,200
then came the other  things

547
00:23:58,200 --> 00:24:01,380
of course that are very important what do

548
00:24:01,380 --> 00:24:03,659
you call the team

549
00:24:03,659 --> 00:24:06,659
Well she that manager I should

550
00:24:06,659 --> 00:24:09,000
call it Idiot security then I thought Ah

551
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:11,460
that's lame and B if you never say it

552
00:24:11,460 --> 00:24:14,700
so

553
00:24:14,700 --> 00:24:17,039
then we thought Ah red team sounds

554
00:24:17,039 --> 00:24:18,780
nice but yes and  that in German big

555
00:24:18,780 --> 00:24:19,880
Steam no

556
00:24:19,880 --> 00:24:23,520
squadar Rossa It sounds deadly and

557
00:24:23,520 --> 00:24:25,140
Keep Rouge That sounds so

558
00:24:25,140 --> 00:24:28,200
wrong again Hey brils or jiddish yes you know I

559
00:24:28,200 --> 00:24:29,940
get that I get that back to

560
00:24:29,940 --> 00:24:31,919
my head so when it finally turned out

561
00:24:31,919 --> 00:24:35,280
in Javanese it turned out  team aban and then

562
00:24:35,280 --> 00:24:37,260
I thought yes and I still have an

563
00:24:37,260 --> 00:24:39,780
Indonesian food all right so now

564
00:24:39,780 --> 00:24:41,760
we are getting an email Dear here bang

565
00:24:41,760 --> 00:24:44,720
Dear Tim

566
00:24:45,659 --> 00:24:47,640
We also had to go a bit, he saves me so

567
00:24:47,640 --> 00:24:48,840
left and right Well of course we have a

568
00:24:48,840 --> 00:24:50,220
brownie in it again  So

569
00:24:50,220 --> 00:24:51,840
this is the light image when we see it from

570
00:24:51,840 --> 00:24:54,059
brani and at one point you

571
00:24:54,059 --> 00:24:56,460
also had a route for tourists and then

572
00:24:56,460 --> 00:24:57,900
I just took a body pass as an example

573
00:24:57,900 --> 00:24:59,460
and then she said yes but that's

574
00:24:59,460 --> 00:25:01,799
something you can't fake so

575
00:25:01,799 --> 00:25:04,679
Brownie  has flown from Catalonia to

576
00:25:04,679 --> 00:25:06,900
Chap de Gaulle

577
00:25:06,900 --> 00:25:09,780
and from Sjaak de Gaulle to Amsterdam and

578
00:25:09,780 --> 00:25:11,760
as you can read at the bottom It is

579
00:25:11,760 --> 00:25:13,559
forbidden to take captured birds Or mice

580
00:25:13,559 --> 00:25:16,080
on board blablabla um it's

581
00:25:16,080 --> 00:25:17,820
fine of course just It's just a

582
00:25:17,820 --> 00:25:19,440
pdf it doesn't do anything  so much

583
00:25:19,440 --> 00:25:22,020
for a good thing It remained eh cats

584
00:25:22,020 --> 00:25:24,539
just remain fun and useful

585
00:25:24,539 --> 00:25:28,559
in the meantime and came the QR codes and

586
00:25:28,559 --> 00:25:30,120
came the exception routes for the

587
00:25:30,120 --> 00:25:31,919
qr codes and came the exceptions of the

588
00:25:31,919 --> 00:25:33,299
exceptions of the exceptions of

589
00:25:33,299 --> 00:25:34,320
the outbursts of the

590
00:25:34,320 --> 00:25:37,740
exceptions of the qr-  codes

591
00:25:37,740 --> 00:25:40,039
yes

592
00:25:40,320 --> 00:25:41,760
but good So there were a lot of

593
00:25:41,760 --> 00:25:43,799
exceptions and many projects

594
00:25:43,799 --> 00:25:46,980
we even built an epd for the

595
00:25:46,980 --> 00:25:49,100
hospitals if they were allowed to vaccinate

596
00:25:49,100 --> 00:25:52,860
ehm we really built an idiotic lot

597
00:25:52,860 --> 00:25:54,779
and one of the people who is not now and

598
00:25:54,779 --> 00:25:57,539
I will explain why in a moment  there

599
00:25:57,539 --> 00:25:59,279
is Niels who was still there yesterday but

600
00:25:59,279 --> 00:26:01,919
then he was suddenly Sander gerderink ehm

601
00:26:01,919 --> 00:26:05,039
but one of the people who eh eh yes

602
00:26:05,039 --> 00:26:07,260
has pulled very hard is Niels to

603
00:26:07,260 --> 00:26:09,120
really the end of his energy

604
00:26:09,120 --> 00:26:12,600
like more people ehm and we had

605
00:26:12,600 --> 00:26:15,360
so 18 projects at the peak for

606
00:26:15,360 --> 00:26:17,400
Four countries because we are in kingdom

607
00:26:17,400 --> 00:26:19,440
with four countries and all four need help

608
00:26:19,440 --> 00:26:20,760


609
00:26:20,760 --> 00:26:23,279
and uh every time it was yes fun we are going to

610
00:26:23,279 --> 00:26:25,679
do and then that was up to team but afraid

611
00:26:25,679 --> 00:26:28,200
we are going to keep it safe for a while well that

612
00:26:28,200 --> 00:26:30,419
you're just not going to keep that up it was

613
00:26:30,419 --> 00:26:32,100
already more work than we can handle but it

614
00:26:32,100 --> 00:26:36,059
's security by design It's ehm the

615
00:26:36,059 --> 00:26:38,659
ongoing attacks We had

616
00:26:38,659 --> 00:26:41,400
our weekly dels every Saturday evening at 7 o'clock

617
00:26:41,400 --> 00:26:43,200
There is an advantage

618
00:26:43,200 --> 00:26:45,779
in that By the way if you know that  you

619
00:26:45,779 --> 00:26:47,340
are divided every Saturday evening at 7 o'clock

620
00:26:47,340 --> 00:26:49,260
then you can arrange

621
00:26:49,260 --> 00:26:51,780
that That is nice then again eh [

622
00:26:51,780 --> 00:26:53,100
Music]

623
00:26:53,100 --> 00:26:54,659
we have of course and

624
00:26:54,659 --> 00:26:57,299
you could read that in the media eh

625
00:26:57,299 --> 00:27:00,179
had the necessary cases of fraud eh well I

626
00:27:00,179 --> 00:27:01,980
knew a lot about fraud namely

627
00:27:01,980 --> 00:27:02,900
not enough

628
00:27:02,900 --> 00:27:05,760
that is you go through quite a

629
00:27:05,760 --> 00:27:07,919
learning curve then suddenly because everyone

630
00:27:07,919 --> 00:27:11,039
suddenly thinks oh politically sensitive so

631
00:27:11,039 --> 00:27:12,539
I'm not going to do that and then it's such a

632
00:27:12,539 --> 00:27:14,279
flying turd and then his fan is sitting right at

633
00:27:14,279 --> 00:27:16,799
my desk that you think

634
00:27:16,799 --> 00:27:20,640
of  Well let's not do that for a while

635
00:27:20,640 --> 00:27:22,140
then of course you just get your

636
00:27:22,140 --> 00:27:24,720
normal compiling eh the least form is

637
00:27:24,720 --> 00:27:27,000
the DigiD order too heavy form is eh

638
00:27:27,000 --> 00:27:31,700
I think eh the nen 7510 and the BIO eh

639
00:27:31,700 --> 00:27:34,919
just your scanning your pen test eh it

640
00:27:34,919 --> 00:27:37,080
already is  a major operation bigger than we

641
00:27:37,080 --> 00:27:39,600
can actually handle

642
00:27:39,600 --> 00:27:41,400
and then we go to part 2 of this

643
00:27:41,400 --> 00:27:45,980
story the cat based security

644
00:27:47,880 --> 00:27:51,000
if you dig a little deep then

645
00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:53,159
we in our cutie industry do

646
00:27:53,159 --> 00:27:54,799
some weird things

647
00:27:54,799 --> 00:27:57,600
One of the things Is that all that's fine

648
00:27:57,600 --> 00:27:59,820
gone is the automation we

649
00:27:59,820 --> 00:28:02,059
prefer to do it by hand

650
00:28:02,059 --> 00:28:05,400
like writing very intensive reports

651
00:28:05,400 --> 00:28:07,700


652
00:28:07,799 --> 00:28:09,779
other things we like to

653
00:28:09,779 --> 00:28:12,779
do by hand is eh a lot of standard tests that you

654
00:28:12,779 --> 00:28:15,299
can easily automate away But you

655
00:28:15,299 --> 00:28:18,900
could also think eh eh if I do a

656
00:28:18,900 --> 00:28:21,360
test  I see that it is good I write

657
00:28:21,360 --> 00:28:23,580
it down And throw away all the results of the

658
00:28:23,580 --> 00:28:25,679
test

659
00:28:25,679 --> 00:28:27,659
We are very good at

660
00:28:27,659 --> 00:28:29,700
doing things traditionally,

661
00:28:29,700 --> 00:28:31,559
so it is also a bit positive They are a bit

662
00:28:31,559 --> 00:28:33,900
open, so the chair and so on, but all those tools

663
00:28:33,900 --> 00:28:36,740
do have the characteristic of Me  take the quickest

664
00:28:36,740 --> 00:28:39,480
by the very shortest route to the

665
00:28:39,480 --> 00:28:42,059
answer to questions

666
00:28:42,059 --> 00:28:44,340
So I want to know if anyone is vulnerable

667
00:28:44,340 --> 00:28:46,380
to log for Jay that's the question

668
00:28:46,380 --> 00:28:48,600
I answer And how I

669
00:28:48,600 --> 00:28:51,840
got there nobody cares

670
00:28:51,840 --> 00:28:54,600
I'm a researcher

671
00:28:54,600 --> 00:28:56,760
I've been 15 years  been an investigative journalist

672
00:28:56,760 --> 00:28:58,500
and actually the answer to the

673
00:28:58,500 --> 00:29:00,659
question is perhaps the least

674
00:29:00,659 --> 00:29:03,900
interesting of my whole investigation

675
00:29:03,900 --> 00:29:06,600
and ask him too police officer

676
00:29:06,600 --> 00:29:08,340
trying to prove to someone if you did something

677
00:29:08,340 --> 00:29:09,840
No a police officer

678
00:29:09,840 --> 00:29:11,940
trying to collect facts and

679
00:29:11,940 --> 00:29:14,100
investigate trying to get facts

680
00:29:14,100 --> 00:29:17,520
and that  then order it to

681
00:29:17,520 --> 00:29:20,039
come to the conclusion so good

682
00:29:20,039 --> 00:29:22,080
I wanted to do that and well one of the people

683
00:29:22,080 --> 00:29:24,299
who is busy with that a lot Jan knocking

684
00:29:24,299 --> 00:29:27,299
and he has ehm as life motto when you

685
00:29:27,299 --> 00:29:28,679
start a company and

686
00:29:28,679 --> 00:29:30,899
quite a few have started there the

687
00:29:30,899 --> 00:29:33,299
you should never do things that are simple first so

688
00:29:33,299 --> 00:29:35,340
logo open bank accounts that kind of

689
00:29:35,340 --> 00:29:37,440
thing you do the complicated

690
00:29:37,440 --> 00:29:40,559
question first so I have a lodge first He called

691
00:29:40,559 --> 00:29:42,000
No well good I had a picture of

692
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:44,220
looking anyway so I did it anyway This

693
00:29:44,220 --> 00:29:46,440
became us  logo

694
00:29:46,440 --> 00:29:48,600
and you first solve the more complex problem

695
00:29:48,600 --> 00:29:50,950
and

696
00:29:50,950 --> 00:29:53,700
[Music]

697
00:29:53,700 --> 00:29:57,960
a few of a questions for you

698
00:29:57,960 --> 00:30:00,120
Who has ever seen a throbbing cmb

699
00:30:00,120 --> 00:30:02,360


700
00:30:04,140 --> 00:30:06,600
Yes an empty Yes exactly if you have nothing yet

701
00:30:06,600 --> 00:30:09,678
yes

702
00:30:10,200 --> 00:30:11,880
that is the Tries for words because

703
00:30:11,880 --> 00:30:13,919
on  the moment you are attacked

704
00:30:13,919 --> 00:30:15,779
and the play so you have something so then

705
00:30:15,779 --> 00:30:17,340
I never know of a road map anywhere

706
00:30:17,340 --> 00:30:21,240
to say which system you have

707
00:30:21,240 --> 00:30:23,820
well

708
00:30:23,820 --> 00:30:25,980
and then we have Tools And they are going to

709
00:30:25,980 --> 00:30:27,840
look for a needle in the haystack In other words I am going to spend

710
00:30:27,840 --> 00:30:29,340
a whole  Pulling haystack apart

711
00:30:29,340 --> 00:30:31,260
so find

712
00:30:31,260 --> 00:30:35,039
Yes they are straw bales Mendel

713
00:30:35,039 --> 00:30:36,779
really You just don't get to

714
00:30:36,779 --> 00:30:40,380
speak today ehm find the pin in a

715
00:30:40,380 --> 00:30:42,360
haystack and then you have that haystack

716
00:30:42,360 --> 00:30:44,640
back and then it's looking for a crown Test

717
00:30:44,640 --> 00:30:45,659
in the earlobe and then you can  I go

718
00:30:45,659 --> 00:30:48,000
through the same Haystack again looking for a sock

719
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:50,580
in the haystack isn't that more logical that

720
00:30:50,580 --> 00:30:52,740
you say I do strobes straw socks at

721
00:30:52,740 --> 00:30:54,299
Soccer pins at the game the sausages at

722
00:30:54,299 --> 00:30:55,860
sausages Kroon It is

723
00:30:55,860 --> 00:30:57,899
testing money at Groningen and money in wallet at

724
00:30:57,899 --> 00:31:00,779
wallets so that if you  at one

725
00:31:00,779 --> 00:31:03,000
point says i want a needle from a

726
00:31:03,000 --> 00:31:04,380
haystack

727
00:31:04,380 --> 00:31:06,480
you say Well that's in the box pins

728
00:31:06,480 --> 00:31:08,779


729
00:31:09,899 --> 00:31:13,679
we build a factsdaal too busy cat

730
00:31:13,679 --> 00:31:16,140
is basically a factsdaal too

731
00:31:16,140 --> 00:31:17,480
busy

732
00:31:17,480 --> 00:31:20,960
database with very simple facts

733
00:31:20,960 --> 00:31:24,059
ip addresses domain names that sort of thing

734
00:31:24,059 --> 00:31:28,279
and  we call that the octopus

735
00:31:30,480 --> 00:31:32,399
and we also fill the cat in the

736
00:31:32,399 --> 00:31:34,620
following way We have plugins

737
00:31:34,620 --> 00:31:37,080
We call them Rascals

738
00:31:37,080 --> 00:31:39,899
and that rake date together and rascal

739
00:31:39,899 --> 00:31:42,840
we start in Containers

740
00:31:42,840 --> 00:31:45,860
and we provide those containers with input

741
00:31:45,860 --> 00:31:49,860
that provide exhaust and network traffic and

742
00:31:49,860 --> 00:31:52,020
store everything  we

743
00:31:52,020 --> 00:31:54,419
and Soon will come and everything

744
00:31:54,419 --> 00:31:56,820
will be us but that's a second thing We'll

745
00:31:56,820 --> 00:32:00,260
start for a while We'll keep everything

746
00:32:00,299 --> 00:32:03,240
and put it in Bites and Bites is

747
00:32:03,240 --> 00:32:05,120
nothing but a data store

748
00:32:05,120 --> 00:32:08,220
and with the help of our whiskers our

749
00:32:08,220 --> 00:32:10,860
whiskers

750
00:32:10,860 --> 00:32:13,380
we'll get the date  out that we understand

751
00:32:13,380 --> 00:32:15,740
what we don't understand

752
00:32:15,740 --> 00:32:19,260
we don't include and if I adjust the normalizer at a late

753
00:32:19,260 --> 00:32:21,419
point in time

754
00:32:21,419 --> 00:32:23,820
because I understand more

755
00:32:23,820 --> 00:32:27,120
from that data then I only add it

756
00:32:27,120 --> 00:32:28,679
to the date little bit

757
00:32:28,679 --> 00:32:31,679
nothing will be in our database what  we don't

758
00:32:31,679 --> 00:32:33,419
understand and can't place it because then

759
00:32:33,419 --> 00:32:36,539
it doesn't fit in an object

760
00:32:36,539 --> 00:32:39,840
This is radical I throw everything

761
00:32:39,840 --> 00:32:41,460
in a bin and I'll see what I

762
00:32:41,460 --> 00:32:43,230
can pull out

763
00:32:43,230 --> 00:32:44,640
[Music]

764
00:32:44,640 --> 00:32:46,740
I have no further criticism of that or

765
00:32:46,740 --> 00:32:49,140
anything The only thing  what i say is this

766
00:32:49,140 --> 00:32:52,140
system what we do is we understand the

767
00:32:52,140 --> 00:32:54,419
date we have and the moment

768
00:32:54,419 --> 00:32:57,120
uhm that date there octopus comes it is

769
00:32:57,120 --> 00:32:58,679
a stitching machine a flag goes

770
00:32:58,679 --> 00:33:00,960
up and it says my status has

771
00:33:00,960 --> 00:33:03,419
changed and what we do is We

772
00:33:03,419 --> 00:33:05,600
search

773
00:33:05,700 --> 00:33:09,120
based on business Rules whether he

774
00:33:09,120 --> 00:33:10,919
can draw conclusions I'm going to give you a very

775
00:33:10,919 --> 00:33:12,679
simple example

776
00:33:12,679 --> 00:33:14,720
I see a

777
00:33:14,720 --> 00:33:17,100
domain name and I discover that with that

778
00:33:17,100 --> 00:33:19,519
domain name there is an ip address

779
00:33:19,519 --> 00:33:21,980
IP version four address

780
00:33:21,980 --> 00:33:26,279
I don't see an IP version 6 address These are

781
00:33:26,279 --> 00:33:28,620
facts

782
00:33:28,620 --> 00:33:31,980
because I  ip address can i

783
00:33:31,980 --> 00:33:34,500
start business Roll of the caliber something with

784
00:33:34,500 --> 00:33:37,640
ip addresses and discover them Hey you have

785
00:33:37,640 --> 00:33:41,039
zero IP version 6 addresses so you do

786
00:33:41,039 --> 00:33:46,380
n't have one IP version 6 address and that gives

787
00:33:46,380 --> 00:33:48,840
you an information

788
00:33:48,840 --> 00:33:51,000
is not one you are not  leak you wo

789
00:33:51,000 --> 00:33:53,340
n't break there is nothing wrong

790
00:33:53,340 --> 00:33:55,559
but because a new objective has now

791
00:33:55,559 --> 00:33:59,460
appeared, namely there is not one ipv6

792
00:33:59,460 --> 00:34:02,820
address for this domain, a second

793
00:34:02,820 --> 00:34:04,740
business role goes off that says Oh but then

794
00:34:04,740 --> 00:34:06,779
you don't have two

795
00:34:06,779 --> 00:34:10,199
still no use  the hand

796
00:34:10,199 --> 00:34:12,839
because you don't have two, a

797
00:34:12,839 --> 00:34:14,040
new business starts rolling off and it says

798
00:34:14,040 --> 00:34:17,040
You will no longer score 100% on

799
00:34:17,040 --> 00:34:19,139
internet.nl

800
00:34:19,139 --> 00:34:22,440
third informational

801
00:34:22,440 --> 00:34:24,659
And the 4th Business School that says You

802
00:34:24,659 --> 00:34:29,580
have an MX record and the context is care

803
00:34:29,580 --> 00:34:33,119
and you  don't have 100% on internet.nl so

804
00:34:33,119 --> 00:34:36,839
you don't offer secure e-mail in healthcare

805
00:34:36,839 --> 00:34:38,580
and if the context is also

806
00:34:38,580 --> 00:34:42,179
a Ministry like now ehm almost or

807
00:34:42,179 --> 00:34:45,540
what is it 11 o'clock or so 10 o'clock then I can come

808
00:34:45,540 --> 00:34:47,040
by because the  minister has started calling

809
00:34:47,040 --> 00:34:48,599
because we apparently deliver knowledge

810
00:34:48,599 --> 00:34:52,020
information in an unsafe

811
00:34:52,020 --> 00:34:55,440
way in the public perception I

812
00:34:55,440 --> 00:34:57,480
now really have quite a bit of a completion issue

813
00:34:57,480 --> 00:34:59,339
you could perhaps

814
00:34:59,339 --> 00:35:02,119
see as critical

815
00:35:04,200 --> 00:35:06,240
Hold that for a while and then we go to the

816
00:35:06,240 --> 00:35:07,680
next  step I said something

817
00:35:07,680 --> 00:35:11,000
IP addresses have appeared

818
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:14,300
and

819
00:35:14,460 --> 00:35:17,700
then because I have an ip address

820
00:35:17,700 --> 00:35:19,859
I could kick off a crook who will

821
00:35:19,859 --> 00:35:21,660
look is over and there is a website on it

822
00:35:21,660 --> 00:35:24,000
well you could find that out by

823
00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:26,040
starting a map And then see  I port 80 in

824
00:35:26,040 --> 00:35:28,440
Port 443 at some point in the

825
00:35:28,440 --> 00:35:30,720
there and that would allow me to

826
00:35:30,720 --> 00:35:32,880
kick off another crook and he says there is really

827
00:35:32,880 --> 00:35:34,560
a website or is only that port

828
00:35:34,560 --> 00:35:36,540
open now another check and then I'm

829
00:35:36,540 --> 00:35:38,640
sure it's a website  Okay cool, there is

830
00:35:38,640 --> 00:35:40,859


831
00:35:40,859 --> 00:35:42,720


832
00:35:42,720 --> 00:35:44,579
a content security police on that website, well then a content security

833
00:35:44,579 --> 00:35:47,579
police comes in and then we pull it

834
00:35:47,579 --> 00:35:49,260
apart and then we see there, for example,

835
00:35:49,260 --> 00:35:51,780
a whitelist doormain

836
00:35:51,780 --> 00:35:53,760
then we asked that domain to the

837
00:35:53,760 --> 00:35:56,280
octopus and then it goes again  that mechanism is

838
00:35:56,280 --> 00:35:57,720
running and it is due to my

839
00:35:57,720 --> 00:35:59,160
pulling it apart now something strange is happening

840
00:35:59,160 --> 00:36:03,180
An NX domain is coming back or ehm

841
00:36:03,180 --> 00:36:05,339
this domain does not exist at all A

842
00:36:05,339 --> 00:36:06,660
big mistake has been made and there is something

843
00:36:06,660 --> 00:36:08,099
that has not been blown that has

844
00:36:08,099 --> 00:36:10,460
to be done

845
00:36:14,400 --> 00:36:16,740
and now  another bit comes out

846
00:36:16,740 --> 00:36:17,960
and it says

847
00:36:17,960 --> 00:36:21,780
cv6 score 10.0

848
00:36:21,780 --> 00:36:23,400
because I only need to register one domain

849
00:36:23,400 --> 00:36:25,079
and I can take over your entire website

850
00:36:25,079 --> 00:36:26,880


851
00:36:26,880 --> 00:36:30,260
Boy ayou [ __ ]

852
00:36:31,380 --> 00:36:33,240
I'm going a bit short but

853
00:36:33,240 --> 00:36:34,339
very flat

854
00:36:34,339 --> 00:36:38,520
now I'm not very simple because

855
00:36:38,520 --> 00:36:41,780
iterative process

856
00:36:42,420 --> 00:36:44,040
suddenly ended up at the very

857
00:36:44,040 --> 00:36:44,839
large

858
00:36:44,839 --> 00:36:47,460
second phenomenon and this is equal

859
00:36:47,460 --> 00:36:50,040
but what is not possible is that is not

860
00:36:50,040 --> 00:36:51,660
knowing movie abilities where you

861
00:36:51,660 --> 00:36:52,920
press start and that at some

862
00:36:52,920 --> 00:36:54,480
point at the end you are ever done because

863
00:36:54,480 --> 00:36:57,300
what is  never done

864
00:36:57,300 --> 00:36:59,000
I can run a movie

865
00:36:59,000 --> 00:37:01,740
based on the data in progress Because

866
00:37:01,740 --> 00:37:03,240
you can do the query on the date in progress

867
00:37:03,240 --> 00:37:05,520
and that could be a movie weatherability report well

868
00:37:05,520 --> 00:37:07,920
we built that too

869
00:37:07,920 --> 00:37:09,200


870
00:37:09,200 --> 00:37:11,640
that you can do those kinds of reports

871
00:37:11,640 --> 00:37:15,980
this is in  the nutshell what cat is

872
00:37:16,440 --> 00:37:19,380
if I gather 10 business schools together

873
00:37:19,380 --> 00:37:22,619
Pick up and I say this I call a control

874
00:37:22,619 --> 00:37:26,880
and I make 100 controls

875
00:37:26,880 --> 00:37:29,040
then at the end of the day I have

876
00:37:29,040 --> 00:37:31,740
run out of a standard

877
00:37:31,740 --> 00:37:33,900
and with that the compleancy machine has

878
00:37:33,900 --> 00:37:35,760
become

879
00:37:35,760 --> 00:37:37,800
and that is a while  basically what crate

880
00:37:37,800 --> 00:37:39,920
is

881
00:37:41,880 --> 00:37:45,359
and then something very strange There are people in this

882
00:37:45,359 --> 00:37:47,599
world who call themselves a pentest

883
00:37:47,599 --> 00:37:50,579
write a report and say Yes this

884
00:37:50,579 --> 00:37:52,260
is broken and then I say how did you get there

885
00:37:52,260 --> 00:37:55,200
well it was 3 o'clock  night

886
00:37:55,200 --> 00:37:56,460
and i dropped a cup of coffee on a

887
00:37:56,460 --> 00:37:58,980
keyboard and then all of a sudden i was soot or

888
00:37:58,980 --> 00:38:01,280


889
00:38:03,060 --> 00:38:05,160
you could say There are people

890
00:38:05,160 --> 00:38:08,339
in this world who say i do Ai

891
00:38:08,339 --> 00:38:10,140
and i do all sorts of calculations and i do

892
00:38:10,140 --> 00:38:11,460
n't know how i got the result

893
00:38:11,460 --> 00:38:13,140


894
00:38:13,140 --> 00:38:16,320
but it is what we do in kat

895
00:38:16,320 --> 00:38:18,260
is Every Step

896
00:38:18,260 --> 00:38:21,660
provided with a hash with which it is

897
00:38:21,660 --> 00:38:24,599
stuck This is the date it is and

898
00:38:24,599 --> 00:38:26,820
that brain is given to an external party

899
00:38:26,820 --> 00:38:29,640
and we have it signed so those few

900
00:38:29,640 --> 00:38:31,260
days do not know what they are what  they

901
00:38:31,260 --> 00:38:33,480
are,

902
00:38:33,480 --> 00:38:35,700
but I can prove that the whole

903
00:38:35,700 --> 00:38:40,320
chain leads to something correct if, for

904
00:38:40,320 --> 00:38:42,300
example, I get that I download a website

905
00:38:42,300 --> 00:38:44,700
and I see a piece of malware there

906
00:38:44,700 --> 00:38:46,500
that I did not recognize before and now

907
00:38:46,500 --> 00:38:48,480
I can not only say that we

908
00:38:48,480 --> 00:38:50,400
have been affected but  can also say

909
00:38:50,400 --> 00:38:52,920
when the first sighting was and I ca

910
00:38:52,920 --> 00:38:54,180
n't just say I can also prove it

911
00:38:54,180 --> 00:38:55,680


912
00:38:55,680 --> 00:38:57,420
that saves you a lot of forensic

913
00:38:57,420 --> 00:39:00,619
research I honestly don't understand why

914
00:39:00,619 --> 00:39:04,500
panthes wasn't born in advance, well

915
00:39:04,500 --> 00:39:07,200
all those plugins we put

916
00:39:07,200 --> 00:39:09,440
together That's what we call  we give the cat logically

917
00:39:09,440 --> 00:39:12,260
and ehm

918
00:39:12,260 --> 00:39:14,940
the more of them there are How magical it

919
00:39:14,940 --> 00:39:17,099
becomes eh so what we mainly need

920
00:39:17,099 --> 00:39:18,780
is of course more of these rascals

921
00:39:18,780 --> 00:39:20,880
and bits

922
00:39:20,880 --> 00:39:23,720
every rascal has impotence four legs

923
00:39:23,720 --> 00:39:27,420
look I'm on a Ministry now so

924
00:39:27,420 --> 00:39:29,460
where I might be as a journalist

925
00:39:29,460 --> 00:39:31,500
could sometimes go a bit further than the law

926
00:39:31,500 --> 00:39:33,900
approved something with freedom of

927
00:39:33,900 --> 00:39:36,480
expression Enzo that is a very

928
00:39:36,480 --> 00:39:39,240
complicated story I mean Ernst

929
00:39:39,240 --> 00:39:42,599
Kuipers hacks ehm eh Catharina

930
00:39:42,599 --> 00:39:44,520
Hospital doesn't seem like a nice headline in the

931
00:39:44,520 --> 00:39:49,560
newspaper Yes you do not me

932
00:39:49,560 --> 00:39:51,540
and I see you  now look at me like that

933
00:39:51,540 --> 00:39:54,359
if you can do that well

934
00:39:54,359 --> 00:39:58,380
because that's my consumption so eh so

935
00:39:58,380 --> 00:39:59,940
we came up with We have four legs

936
00:39:59,940 --> 00:40:02,839
for cats for rascals

937
00:40:02,839 --> 00:40:07,800
one leg means you can't do anything you ca

938
00:40:07,800 --> 00:40:10,619
n't do anything except publicly available

939
00:40:10,619 --> 00:40:13,560
collect information two is you have

940
00:40:13,560 --> 00:40:16,260
permission to use you as an

941
00:40:16,260 --> 00:40:19,020
end use three is you can have a little

942
00:40:19,020 --> 00:40:21,060
more and four is what some people

943
00:40:21,060 --> 00:40:23,060
call a crazy shave Terminal nuclear warfare

944
00:40:23,060 --> 00:40:25,560
everything is hello it's things you

945
00:40:25,560 --> 00:40:28,200
do in production i would never give 4 but for

946
00:40:28,200 --> 00:40:29,760
example on an acceptance would

947
00:40:29,760 --> 00:40:33,240
so you can do that ehm

948
00:40:33,240 --> 00:40:35,820
and this will be This will also be drawn and

949
00:40:35,820 --> 00:40:37,740
This will also be propagated so that we also

950
00:40:37,740 --> 00:40:39,540
know for sure that we are not

951
00:40:39,540 --> 00:40:42,300
going too far And this is also useful because you have

952
00:40:42,300 --> 00:40:45,119
those sensors and things that sometimes

953
00:40:45,119 --> 00:40:46,680
return information  think of the

954
00:40:46,680 --> 00:40:49,020
National Detection Network We are just now

955
00:40:49,020 --> 00:40:52,079
integrating that and if you

956
00:40:52,079 --> 00:40:54,960
put data in your Craft

957
00:40:54,960 --> 00:40:57,000
then you really don't want to make contact with

958
00:40:57,000 --> 00:40:58,920
that ip address that

959
00:40:58,920 --> 00:41:01,020
could give very wrong impressions and yet I want

960
00:41:01,020 --> 00:41:03,180
information about  have well

961
00:41:03,180 --> 00:41:05,839
then give it one leg

962
00:41:06,540 --> 00:41:08,820
yes Look again sound is it doesn't want to

963
00:41:08,820 --> 00:41:10,440
start rascals by hand all the time

964
00:41:10,440 --> 00:41:11,820
so we made a pretty cool

965
00:41:11,820 --> 00:41:14,700
schedule called Mula and erm

966
00:41:14,700 --> 00:41:17,400
a lot of energy is put into it because

967
00:41:17,400 --> 00:41:18,660
you can imagine  that a

968
00:41:18,660 --> 00:41:20,700
literal process makes a lot of difference how

969
00:41:20,700 --> 00:41:22,320
you do that and especially when an environment

970
00:41:22,320 --> 00:41:25,200
grows bigger so that's yes that's

971
00:41:25,200 --> 00:41:28,440
a thing Well erm just to

972
00:41:28,440 --> 00:41:30,420
prevent cold feet that you only

973
00:41:30,420 --> 00:41:32,099
have to look at a command line

974
00:41:32,099 --> 00:41:34,619
obviously also have a front  End

975
00:41:34,619 --> 00:41:37,020
erm very cool people are also working

976
00:41:37,020 --> 00:41:39,480
on that who are working on that erm we are doing

977
00:41:39,480 --> 00:41:40,920
a lot now come our own

978
00:41:40,920 --> 00:41:43,800
cat house style soon but now it will stop us

979
00:41:43,800 --> 00:41:47,400
for a while erm at the Rijkshuis couple

980
00:41:47,400 --> 00:41:49,140
What do you say

981
00:41:49,140 --> 00:41:52,200
absolutely yes no that is No without

982
00:41:52,200 --> 00:41:54,780
craziness  ehm barrier free is very important to me

983
00:41:54,780 --> 00:41:56,780


984
00:41:56,780 --> 00:41:59,579
we have a date beast with just

985
00:41:59,579 --> 00:42:00,960
just a noll beast that we

986
00:42:00,960 --> 00:42:03,119
build based on things we

987
00:42:03,119 --> 00:42:04,619
add ourselves but especially those things that

988
00:42:04,619 --> 00:42:06,839
are publicly available a

989
00:42:06,839 --> 00:42:08,400
glossary you have and

990
00:42:08,400 --> 00:42:10,440
things like that to just  make the report more

991
00:42:10,440 --> 00:42:12,599
readable if you print a report

992
00:42:12,599 --> 00:42:14,880
and then he just starts

993
00:42:14,880 --> 00:42:16,619
looking for words himself and then he adds

994
00:42:16,619 --> 00:42:18,359
the definitions and things like that

995
00:42:18,359 --> 00:42:21,119
Well we shot cat into the air

996
00:42:21,119 --> 00:42:26,880
on October 4 World Animal Day eh 20 21

997
00:42:26,880 --> 00:42:29,460
made a small party and  we have

998
00:42:29,460 --> 00:42:31,200
loosened up on our test

999
00:42:31,200 --> 00:42:33,180
providers who all

1000
00:42:33,180 --> 00:42:35,880
supply nominated pentests and the dogged

1001
00:42:35,880 --> 00:42:37,980
things were found We use it for

1002
00:42:37,980 --> 00:42:39,960
more things and of course there was also a

1003
00:42:39,960 --> 00:42:42,680
government newspaper site

1004
00:42:44,280 --> 00:42:46,640
Yes that is the central question

1005
00:42:46,640 --> 00:42:50,339
how does VVS see this and then

1006
00:42:50,339 --> 00:42:54,540
coincidence that  eh my consernment is sitting in the

1007
00:42:54,540 --> 00:42:58,279
room Oscar How does vws see this

1008
00:43:02,960 --> 00:43:06,540
obviously no cables were touched

1009
00:43:06,540 --> 00:43:09,359
during this action indeed the Center in

1010
00:43:09,359 --> 00:43:11,960
Amsterdam happens to be

1011
00:43:11,960 --> 00:43:14,280
for the viewers This is indeed De Kas

1012
00:43:14,280 --> 00:43:17,940
am I have ehm yes let's know eh

1013
00:43:17,940 --> 00:43:20,099
eh Who happened to have  last

1014
00:43:20,099 --> 00:43:21,960
Tuesday I am not allowed to refer to it officially,

1015
00:43:21,960 --> 00:43:23,160
but of course I can

1016
00:43:23,160 --> 00:43:25,020
ask if you happened to see an evening eh

1017
00:43:25,020 --> 00:43:29,480
for Lubach about websites

1018
00:43:30,020 --> 00:43:33,540
Yes, there are several websites indeed I am

1019
00:43:33,540 --> 00:43:35,400
not allowed to refer to the after this

1020
00:43:35,400 --> 00:43:37,500
broadcast, but it's nice that you do

1021
00:43:37,500 --> 00:43:39,960
too  look coincidentally eh there is

1022
00:43:39,960 --> 00:43:41,819
indeed stated How many websites there

1023
00:43:41,819 --> 00:43:42,780
were I don't know if you

1024
00:43:42,780 --> 00:43:44,660
can still remember the number

1025
00:43:44,660 --> 00:43:49,200
Yes 1800 registered

1026
00:43:49,200 --> 00:43:52,140
on formally approved registered

1027
00:43:52,140 --> 00:43:54,020
websites indeed

1028
00:43:54,020 --> 00:43:57,060
but Luba is not a cat uh but if you

1029
00:43:57,060 --> 00:43:58,859
look for yourself our own registrations

1030
00:43:58,859 --> 00:44:00,900
already show 600  that is a fact

1031
00:44:00,900 --> 00:44:04,859
eh 600 registered I

1032
00:44:04,859 --> 00:44:07,200
went through CRT puntsh once and then

1033
00:44:07,200 --> 00:44:09,000
you see already 1800 only from one

1034
00:44:09,000 --> 00:44:11,880
departmental organization and we

1035
00:44:11,880 --> 00:44:14,460
have 25 and we also have

1036
00:44:14,460 --> 00:44:16,700
150 eh Foundation

1037
00:44:16,700 --> 00:44:20,040
ehm so maybe they are there  a little bit later

1038
00:44:20,040 --> 00:44:22,920
ehm and then we also have

1039
00:44:22,920 --> 00:44:24,359
the problem if we just

1040
00:44:24,359 --> 00:44:26,520
take the example You have one website

1041
00:44:26,520 --> 00:44:28,260
well how many sets are there on a

1042
00:44:28,260 --> 00:44:29,520
website

1043
00:44:29,520 --> 00:44:32,400
many every little point thing is

1044
00:44:32,400 --> 00:44:33,900
finally a fact What

1045
00:44:33,900 --> 00:44:36,300
can all go wrong again so  I look

1046
00:44:36,300 --> 00:44:39,180
at grab a bite eh about 100,000

1047
00:44:39,180 --> 00:44:42,300
points to check by hand Well I

1048
00:44:42,300 --> 00:44:43,560
think my dear civil servants

1049
00:44:43,560 --> 00:44:45,420
colleagues don't like that very much because

1050
00:44:45,420 --> 00:44:47,940
it sucks After that they

1051
00:44:47,940 --> 00:44:49,200
don't get it because they suddenly

1052
00:44:49,200 --> 00:44:51,020
all have to read aitf standard

1053
00:44:51,020 --> 00:44:54,000
they walk  not even after that they say

1054
00:44:54,000 --> 00:44:55,380
Throw Yes but I ordered one from this

1055
00:44:55,380 --> 00:44:57,140
marketer that went very well

1056
00:44:57,140 --> 00:45:01,660
Yes that eh no [

1057
00:45:01,660 --> 00:45:03,920
Laughter]

1058
00:45:03,920 --> 00:45:06,420
is a lot of euros have indeed

1059
00:45:06,420 --> 00:45:08,760
gone to wild websites and then you do ask

1060
00:45:08,760 --> 00:45:10,500
wait and see if this is just

1061
00:45:10,500 --> 00:45:12,180
the image  is from a small piece of

1062
00:45:12,180 --> 00:45:14,400
research of a few minutes at one

1063
00:45:14,400 --> 00:45:16,980
Ministry How much is that at all those

1064
00:45:16,980 --> 00:45:19,619
organizations that we don't all know

1065
00:45:19,619 --> 00:45:22,200
so what we start with is that we

1066
00:45:22,200 --> 00:45:23,819
finally

1067
00:45:23,819 --> 00:45:25,680
had to tell colleagues first and that is a

1068
00:45:25,680 --> 00:45:27,180
campaign that is now  will only start

1069
00:45:27,180 --> 00:45:29,400
internally and that is what do you

1070
00:45:29,400 --> 00:45:30,900
actually have to do to put a website safely

1071
00:45:30,900 --> 00:45:33,480
online and what do you have to do if

1072
00:45:33,480 --> 00:45:35,940
you have to put an API and an app online such

1073
00:45:35,940 --> 00:45:39,260
an API How do you spell that

1074
00:45:39,260 --> 00:45:42,480
what is that what can you do with it  Well

1075
00:45:42,480 --> 00:45:43,740
you can ask those kinds of questions

1076
00:45:43,740 --> 00:45:45,060
again that they already don't

1077
00:45:45,060 --> 00:45:46,500
understand the difference between a website and

1078
00:45:46,500 --> 00:45:48,960
the epi In addition, this website is allowed Well

1079
00:45:48,960 --> 00:45:50,880
mele yes or no

1080
00:45:50,880 --> 00:45:54,420
Yes can email it Yes do it no that is

1081
00:45:54,420 --> 00:45:55,680
wrong because on  the moment you

1082
00:45:55,680 --> 00:45:57,540
spleen once, then you may get

1083
00:45:57,540 --> 00:45:58,980
the memory of a few years ago

1084
00:45:58,980 --> 00:46:01,380
that some people may suddenly

1085
00:46:01,380 --> 00:46:04,020
take over a domain name that has been lost and

1086
00:46:04,020 --> 00:46:05,760
then set up a mail server themselves to

1087
00:46:05,760 --> 00:46:08,579
intercept the e-mails I would

1088
00:46:08,579 --> 00:46:10,579
harm a cyber investigation  set up

1089
00:46:10,579 --> 00:46:13,560
We have it eh the advice is eh has

1090
00:46:13,560 --> 00:46:15,359
come to us good luck again on that

1091
00:46:15,359 --> 00:46:17,220
self good laugh yes [ __ ] this is

1092
00:46:17,220 --> 00:46:19,680
indeed a thing eh plus in addition

1093
00:46:19,680 --> 00:46:21,300
all those links are going out Where is it

1094
00:46:21,300 --> 00:46:22,440
all going that we all

1095
00:46:22,440 --> 00:46:24,420
view government websites where  you go to the

1096
00:46:24,420 --> 00:46:25,680
left

1097
00:46:25,680 --> 00:46:27,720
That is a hint to you can link a very

1098
00:46:27,720 --> 00:46:30,180
strange thing also has to do

1099
00:46:30,180 --> 00:46:32,579
with Public Health Welfare and for

1100
00:46:32,579 --> 00:46:35,720
some people that it really does sport

1101
00:46:35,720 --> 00:46:38,940
but happens so yes it all

1102
00:46:38,940 --> 00:46:40,619
ends automatically then you just do

1103
00:46:40,619 --> 00:46:41,579
n't notice this anymore  to do with

1104
00:46:41,579 --> 00:46:45,900
human hands and eh wait yes yesterday

1105
00:46:45,900 --> 00:46:47,520
I had a conversation with a

1106
00:46:47,520 --> 00:46:49,680
eh ministry with a gray tower on

1107
00:46:49,680 --> 00:46:51,119
the other side It obstructs my view

1108
00:46:51,119 --> 00:46:54,000
towards the other side of The Hague and

1109
00:46:54,000 --> 00:46:57,000
eh next to the Red Tower coincidentally and they

1110
00:46:57,000 --> 00:46:58,500
came  even though you throw ideas

1111
00:46:58,500 --> 00:47:00,240
eh are actually very cool and

1112
00:47:00,240 --> 00:47:02,280
on the one hand telling what should

1113
00:47:02,280 --> 00:47:03,540
an official actually do to

1114
00:47:03,540 --> 00:47:06,000
work correctly and on the other hand

1115
00:47:06,000 --> 00:47:08,160
the control mechanism and the

1116
00:47:08,160 --> 00:47:09,900
control mechanism by hand that

1117
00:47:09,900 --> 00:47:11,940
just doesn't work anymore  you

1118
00:47:11,940 --> 00:47:14,099
need automation so we are going to work with open

1119
00:47:14,099 --> 00:47:15,420
cat to

1120
00:47:15,420 --> 00:47:17,819
do that in the end and but

1121
00:47:17,819 --> 00:47:19,319
yes it doesn't just stay with vws

1122
00:47:19,319 --> 00:47:22,079
and that's the cool thing about it and what

1123
00:47:22,079 --> 00:47:25,140
's also really cool eh, those are

1124
00:47:25,140 --> 00:47:26,819
civil servants who  also just have the guts

1125
00:47:26,819 --> 00:47:28,740
to stick your neck out and cover your back

1126
00:47:28,740 --> 00:47:30,240
at the moment when we of course

1127
00:47:30,240 --> 00:47:32,220
sometimes do very wild things and

1128
00:47:32,220 --> 00:47:33,839
I really think that's a round of applause wherever it

1129
00:47:33,839 --> 00:47:35,900


1130
00:47:39,560 --> 00:47:42,960
sometimes happens sometimes something

1131
00:47:42,960 --> 00:47:45,000
Sometimes there are sometimes  colleagues after

1132
00:47:45,000 --> 00:47:46,560
colleagues who are also here Can I have the

1133
00:47:46,560 --> 00:47:49,520
Mike oh

1134
00:47:50,880 --> 00:47:52,680
More people have started playing with us

1135
00:47:52,680 --> 00:47:56,280
eh in the healthcare sector also that outside one of the

1136
00:47:56,280 --> 00:47:57,980
Toffe I find the order service Rijk

1137
00:47:57,980 --> 00:48:00,720
eh because they suddenly see

1138
00:48:00,720 --> 00:48:02,720
all kinds of possibilities for the DigiD order

1139
00:48:02,720 --> 00:48:07,619
eh  but also very cool eh it says for

1140
00:48:07,619 --> 00:48:10,200
the care If yes

1141
00:48:10,200 --> 00:48:13,800
[Applause]

1142
00:48:13,800 --> 00:48:16,140
and they are running a pilot and

1143
00:48:16,140 --> 00:48:18,900
um they are squashing and discovering all our bugs handily

1144
00:48:18,900 --> 00:48:23,460
um thanks for that and um that

1145
00:48:23,460 --> 00:48:25,800
's quite a big thing because we also

1146
00:48:25,800 --> 00:48:27,359
data the law  exchange in healthcare

1147
00:48:27,359 --> 00:48:29,579
and that means that

1148
00:48:29,579 --> 00:48:31,560
a lot of organizations will soon need all kinds of

1149
00:48:31,560 --> 00:48:34,140
support Ehm also

1150
00:48:34,140 --> 00:48:35,400
companies like me, for example a

1151
00:48:35,400 --> 00:48:37,740
clarenet eh, have joined knowledge networks

1152
00:48:37,740 --> 00:48:39,420
9,000 schools are now also

1153
00:48:39,420 --> 00:48:41,760
looking very carefully yes that is

1154
00:48:41,760 --> 00:48:43,920
just

1155
00:48:43,920 --> 00:48:47,160
great This is just a moment  the rough explanation about

1156
00:48:47,160 --> 00:48:49,920
cat I don't know if we have been asked so far

1157
00:48:49,920 --> 00:48:51,780
because otherwise you will still be sent to

1158
00:48:51,780 --> 00:48:54,260
announcements

1159
00:49:11,960 --> 00:49:14,579
for public available in or

1160
00:49:14,579 --> 00:49:17,280
only sent in for internal very

1161
00:49:17,280 --> 00:49:19,619
good question We have everything healing party

1162
00:49:19,619 --> 00:49:21,900
so in principle he what we are doing now is

1163
00:49:21,900 --> 00:49:24,780
mainly  internet based ehm we

1164
00:49:24,780 --> 00:49:26,819
also really want to get behind the Fireball because

1165
00:49:26,819 --> 00:49:28,380
we also do things like

1166
00:49:28,380 --> 00:49:31,220
look at a software promise materials

1167
00:49:31,220 --> 00:49:33,900
hey if someone runs WordPress then

1168
00:49:33,900 --> 00:49:35,400
you know that not only that they

1169
00:49:35,400 --> 00:49:38,300
run WordPress but also those 1500 as many

1170
00:49:38,300 --> 00:49:41,040
libraries that are underneath it as one  of

1171
00:49:41,040 --> 00:49:42,720
that diaper is leaking Do you also want to warn those people

1172
00:49:42,720 --> 00:49:45,119
ehm you would

1173
00:49:45,119 --> 00:49:46,920
rather do that behind the Fireball We have

1174
00:49:46,920 --> 00:49:49,560
already thought about that a lot eh it is so

1175
00:49:49,560 --> 00:49:51,420
modular and container

1176
00:49:51,420 --> 00:49:54,540


1177
00:49:54,540 --> 00:49:56,400
a name for that project kitten

1178
00:49:56,400 --> 00:49:58,800
ehm that is just cardboard a Paay

1179
00:49:58,800 --> 00:50:00,240
so you could also put it

1180
00:50:00,240 --> 00:50:01,740
at a hospital, for example, but also at

1181
00:50:01,740 --> 00:50:03,660
small organizations or a general practitioner look

1182
00:50:03,660 --> 00:50:07,280
everywhere and yes

1183
00:50:07,280 --> 00:50:10,819
my quirk

1184
00:50:10,980 --> 00:50:14,040
you talk too much with Misha

1185
00:50:14,040 --> 00:50:19,680
take exactly that ehm  eh that that eh

1186
00:50:19,680 --> 00:50:21,660
is also true but still just call it

1187
00:50:21,660 --> 00:50:24,060
kitten eh but you also want to be

1188
00:50:24,060 --> 00:50:25,500
able to control it from a central point

1189
00:50:25,500 --> 00:50:28,980
or vice versa you

1190
00:50:28,980 --> 00:50:30,960
may not want it per se that doesn't

1191
00:50:30,960 --> 00:50:32,819
matter that much But yes there we are

1192
00:50:32,819 --> 00:50:35,400
working on it and behind the fireballs are

1193
00:50:35,400 --> 00:50:36,960
also looking at that There is an

1194
00:50:36,960 --> 00:50:39,359
organization that is currently

1195
00:50:39,359 --> 00:50:41,220
looking They already have something to make those kinds of

1196
00:50:41,220 --> 00:50:43,859
inventories but we can

1197
00:50:43,859 --> 00:50:46,260
still bite a lot and that software

1198
00:50:46,260 --> 00:50:48,420
is open source and they want it

1199
00:50:48,420 --> 00:50:49,800
maybe start transferring so that is

1200
00:50:49,800 --> 00:50:52,500
carefully looked at then I would

1201
00:50:52,500 --> 00:50:54,660
also, for example, you have for example on

1202
00:50:54,660 --> 00:50:56,880
eh switches and if

1203
00:50:56,880 --> 00:50:59,819
you only see the mak addresses then

1204
00:50:59,819 --> 00:51:02,040
you already know a lot about the infrastructure and then

1205
00:51:02,040 --> 00:51:03,480
you could read all the lists  do with

1206
00:51:03,480 --> 00:51:06,839
why Is this not correct with your cmdb eh

1207
00:51:06,839 --> 00:51:08,460
so there is still a lot to gain there

1208
00:51:08,460 --> 00:51:10,680
we have now mainly focused on

1209
00:51:10,680 --> 00:51:12,839
the operating system and now the

1210
00:51:12,839 --> 00:51:14,400
coloring is

1211
00:51:14,400 --> 00:51:18,540
cool Thank you more questions Yes there is

1212
00:51:18,540 --> 00:51:20,900
another one

1213
00:51:22,859 --> 00:51:25,700
this is now open on Gitte  and

1214
00:51:25,700 --> 00:51:29,720
insightful and accepting

1215
00:51:30,260 --> 00:51:33,240
indeed started internally for a while on 1

1216
00:51:33,240 --> 00:51:36,540
July last year kat has become open source

1217
00:51:36,540 --> 00:51:42,000
ehm within 3 hours dvd

1218
00:51:42,000 --> 00:51:45,180
found the first errors opening the Ergo

1219
00:51:45,180 --> 00:51:47,899
makes sense

1220
00:51:48,900 --> 00:51:51,119
and I believe that we did

1221
00:51:51,119 --> 00:51:52,440
indeed immediately squash that too the next day

1222
00:51:52,440 --> 00:51:55,079
so that's also really cool um

1223
00:51:55,079 --> 00:51:57,119
but so there's no point in

1224
00:51:57,119 --> 00:51:59,660
opening since January 1st

1225
00:51:59,660 --> 00:52:01,800
we only developed on the

1226
00:52:01,800 --> 00:52:04,980
Public Repo there's nothing left in terms of

1227
00:52:04,980 --> 00:52:07,559
say what is now the cat Suite there are

1228
00:52:07,559 --> 00:52:08,940
still a few  things internal that have yet to be

1229
00:52:08,940 --> 00:52:11,400
released but what I have just

1230
00:52:11,400 --> 00:52:13,920
described is all open is being developed in the

1231
00:52:13,920 --> 00:52:15,900
open so if a developer

1232
00:52:15,900 --> 00:52:18,300
does something stupid they have very steep

1233
00:52:18,300 --> 00:52:20,900
learning curves

1234
00:52:22,140 --> 00:52:25,020
and eh I know but I find this a very

1235
00:52:25,020 --> 00:52:27,960
scary statement But it could be

1236
00:52:27,960 --> 00:52:29,700
could be the only government project that

1237
00:52:29,700 --> 00:52:30,900
currently functions in this way

1238
00:52:30,900 --> 00:52:33,240
but well within the open so

1239
00:52:33,240 --> 00:52:36,618
seeing this is not very particularly

1240
00:52:37,500 --> 00:52:39,359
good

1241
00:52:39,359 --> 00:52:42,119
with story continues because one is uhm

1242
00:52:42,119 --> 00:52:44,160
you can of course scan to

1243
00:52:44,160 --> 00:52:45,720
find things but another thing is

1244
00:52:45,720 --> 00:52:47,220
of course You also have more often with your

1245
00:52:47,220 --> 00:52:50,460
logbooks and ehm

1246
00:52:50,460 --> 00:52:52,559
It's very bizarre isn't it This takes everything

1247
00:52:52,559 --> 00:52:54,599
privacy by design and then the

1248
00:52:54,599 --> 00:52:56,220
logbook and especially in healthcare you have

1249
00:52:56,220 --> 00:52:58,680
the net 75 13 which also states that you

1250
00:52:58,680 --> 00:53:01,020
have to do just about everything  logging in and then

1251
00:53:01,020 --> 00:53:02,339
it ends up in the security Operation

1252
00:53:02,339 --> 00:53:04,079
Center and there are someone

1253
00:53:04,079 --> 00:53:06,780
in it who is allowed to play by God, he

1254
00:53:06,780 --> 00:53:09,540
really has everything at his disposal.

1255
00:53:09,540 --> 00:53:12,000


1256
00:53:12,000 --> 00:53:15,920


1257
00:53:18,059 --> 00:53:20,640
then always the question who

1258
00:53:20,640 --> 00:53:22,740
thought that was a good idea and why is he

1259
00:53:22,740 --> 00:53:24,920
still employed

1260
00:53:24,920 --> 00:53:28,140
but this is how we work and everything

1261
00:53:28,140 --> 00:53:30,599
makes sense eh that antamera that is also a

1262
00:53:30,599 --> 00:53:32,700
bit eh because then you can

1263
00:53:32,700 --> 00:53:34,740
get what your uses case is from the date

1264
00:53:34,740 --> 00:53:36,720
should be this is real this is

1265
00:53:36,720 --> 00:53:38,460
another weird twist of the brain you might also be

1266
00:53:38,460 --> 00:53:42,000
thinking what is my product doing how

1267
00:53:42,000 --> 00:53:43,859
could this go wrong i

1268
00:53:43,859 --> 00:53:45,359
haven't even told that yet but i introduced to VVS

1269
00:53:45,359 --> 00:53:47,819
the filiomotefectoralis is

1270
00:53:47,819 --> 00:53:51,300
and our only questions is how  can this go wrong

1271
00:53:51,300 --> 00:53:52,740


1272
00:53:52,740 --> 00:53:54,599
and you

1273
00:53:54,599 --> 00:53:56,640
should actually do that towards your sock and how

1274
00:53:56,640 --> 00:53:58,500
can I detect that that is also part

1275
00:53:58,500 --> 00:54:01,619
of the fmmea well

1276
00:54:01,619 --> 00:54:04,740
This is Hans the council And Hans the council who

1277
00:54:04,740 --> 00:54:06,900
had already made a solution for the Pharma

1278
00:54:06,900 --> 00:54:09,119
where you can go on your uh at high

1279
00:54:09,119 --> 00:54:10,680
speed through a lot of Loch inventus

1280
00:54:10,680 --> 00:54:13,380
not only vertically eh if

1281
00:54:13,380 --> 00:54:16,079
i see this then i sound the alarm But i also see

1282
00:54:16,079 --> 00:54:18,480
x happening a number of times within

1283
00:54:18,480 --> 00:54:23,220
a certain time or XI moves and ABC ND and

1284
00:54:23,220 --> 00:54:24,960
erm

1285
00:54:24,960 --> 00:54:26,160
there you can  you can also do things like

1286
00:54:26,160 --> 00:54:28,260
pattern recognition Ergo you can

1287
00:54:28,260 --> 00:54:30,300
make quirus that exactly match

1288
00:54:30,300 --> 00:54:33,859
this issue and ehm

1289
00:54:33,859 --> 00:54:36,540
that just didn't quite do what we needed

1290
00:54:36,540 --> 00:54:38,220
so we asked Hans

1291
00:54:38,220 --> 00:54:42,119
to adjust that and open the software you

1292
00:54:42,119 --> 00:54:44,339
already had  such as to

1293
00:54:44,339 --> 00:54:46,319
make available then I ask the small

1294
00:54:46,319 --> 00:54:49,020
kbab company are you willing to

1295
00:54:49,020 --> 00:54:51,180
do Well he is called a company open

1296
00:54:51,180 --> 00:54:53,280
novation so that open that is already a

1297
00:54:53,280 --> 00:54:56,099
word that suits him well and so he has

1298
00:54:56,099 --> 00:54:58,859
the software uh vws for  hey so

1299
00:54:58,859 --> 00:55:01,740
after that color has also been donated and it is

1300
00:55:01,740 --> 00:55:03,660
now also going to be available under the

1301
00:55:03,660 --> 00:55:05,819
eupl and that will be a different kind of

1302
00:55:05,819 --> 00:55:07,500
Siem

1303
00:55:07,500 --> 00:55:09,480
and we call that Kelvin after his

1304
00:55:09,480 --> 00:55:12,540
now deceased cat ehm

1305
00:55:12,540 --> 00:55:14,339
we have added some things to that that

1306
00:55:14,339 --> 00:55:16,200
make sense  finds mq via Rabbit

1307
00:55:16,200 --> 00:55:17,760
so that no logbook

1308
00:55:17,760 --> 00:55:20,180
lines are ever lost, we example

1309
00:55:20,180 --> 00:55:22,619
and then you only forward the findings

1310
00:55:22,619 --> 00:55:24,720
because this is eh at high volume

1311
00:55:24,720 --> 00:55:26,640
you would also do that for things like you

1312
00:55:26,640 --> 00:55:28,319
need to keep an eye on network traffic or something

1313
00:55:28,319 --> 00:55:30,540
well that find  I'm really very

1314
00:55:30,540 --> 00:55:35,040
cool it will be available soon and

1315
00:55:35,040 --> 00:55:36,599
it will be added to Medi's cat

1316
00:55:36,599 --> 00:55:38,880
then there will be something else left

1317
00:55:38,880 --> 00:55:39,859


1318
00:55:39,859 --> 00:55:42,960
what if people

1319
00:55:42,960 --> 00:55:45,119
have to sign and if you go home to

1320
00:55:45,119 --> 00:55:48,420
buy it will look something like this eh

1321
00:55:48,420 --> 00:55:51,300
then then ehm then you get a link

1322
00:55:51,300 --> 00:55:52,980
via the flour and if you click on that link

1323
00:55:52,980 --> 00:55:54,660
then click 10 times in a

1324
00:55:54,660 --> 00:55:56,700
screen then you have bought a house

1325
00:55:56,700 --> 00:55:58,559
what would happen if I

1326
00:55:58,559 --> 00:56:02,400

1330
00:56:09,720 --> 00:56:13,879
for security How do you solve this

1331
00:56:14,190 --> 00:56:15,599

1335
00:56:29,700 --> 00:56:32,058


1336
00:56:34,200 --> 00:56:39,500
where is it Yes hello hello it's bedtime

1337
00:56:42,359 --> 00:56:44,040
I had already foreseen him a bit

1338
00:56:44,040 --> 00:56:47,040
that this would happen because he

1339
00:56:47,040 --> 00:56:48,540
is now here as a crypto

1340
00:56:48,540 --> 00:56:50,839
architect How do you solve this

1341
00:56:50,839 --> 00:56:53,579
my signatures

1342
00:56:53,579 --> 00:56:55,740
electronic digital signatures

1343
00:56:55,740 --> 00:56:57,480
so very easy we have

1344
00:56:57,480 --> 00:57:00,540
of those computers and the uh biggest one

1345
00:57:00,540 --> 00:57:02,579
about you has one in your pocket those

1346
00:57:02,579 --> 00:57:04,079
things just have very safe things

1347
00:57:04,079 --> 00:57:06,540
the chance that you give away your phone is

1348
00:57:06,540 --> 00:57:09,420
a small uh about the size of

1349
00:57:09,420 --> 00:57:10,740
a Smart Card we think that's good

1350
00:57:10,740 --> 00:57:11,760
enough You can get one

1351
00:57:11,760 --> 00:57:14,819
set up a password pin code and you can eh yes make sure

1352
00:57:14,819 --> 00:57:17,220
that only your phone likes a certain

1353
00:57:17,220 --> 00:57:19,260
certificate Well then you have to

1354
00:57:19,260 --> 00:57:21,359
have a process that allows you to safely extract that certificate

1355
00:57:21,359 --> 00:57:23,220
from Holt, for example, to

1356
00:57:23,220 --> 00:57:25,020
log in with your professional register or something or eh

1357
00:57:25,020 --> 00:57:27,359
say something else you are the

1358
00:57:27,359 --> 00:57:30,900
government that idea or something and eh this

1359
00:57:30,900 --> 00:57:33,059
certificate is out and then someone can

1360
00:57:33,059 --> 00:57:34,980
sign with the certificate so do

1361
00:57:34,980 --> 00:57:36,540
n't actually do anything new like since eh yes

1362
00:57:36,540 --> 00:57:39,240
when has x5009 existed

1363
00:57:39,240 --> 00:57:41,240
for a long time

1364
00:57:41,240 --> 00:57:43,380
about my age I think a little

1365
00:57:43,380 --> 00:57:47,099
less but eh yes I'm really old and

1366
00:57:47,099 --> 00:57:51,180
really really old so  At one point they had

1367
00:57:51,180 --> 00:57:52,619
developers ehm

1368
00:57:52,619 --> 00:57:55,440
available who made eh eh apps that

1369
00:57:55,440 --> 00:57:57,420
still had to eh that knowledge had to

1370
00:57:57,420 --> 00:58:00,599
remain but yes it works dries

1371
00:58:00,599 --> 00:58:01,740
up at some point and they have therefore

1372
00:58:01,740 --> 00:58:04,800
used project cars from if you

1373
00:58:04,800 --> 00:58:06,839
have time left then  So are you going

1374
00:58:06,839 --> 00:58:09,540
to program this and then uh you will be shared

1375
00:58:09,540 --> 00:58:12,059
by Mendel and then it's a few weeks

1376
00:58:12,059 --> 00:58:13,800
later that's handy I mean

1377
00:58:13,800 --> 00:58:14,940
just explain well what you have to make

1378
00:58:14,940 --> 00:58:16,800
at such a moment and then people do that and then

1379
00:58:16,800 --> 00:58:18,599
yes then I have  do you think that this is

1380
00:58:18,599 --> 00:58:19,980
actually what the European woolen in

1381
00:58:19,980 --> 00:58:21,300
Dutch woolen

1382
00:58:21,300 --> 00:58:23,780
should be able to do in the future someday

1383
00:58:23,780 --> 00:58:26,400
that's nice but now I

1384
00:58:26,400 --> 00:58:27,839
actually want an order to

1385
00:58:27,839 --> 00:58:29,220
sign this and then I also want that to be

1386
00:58:29,220 --> 00:58:32,160
correct forensic and if so then  he

1387
00:58:32,160 --> 00:58:33,900
logs in that they are professional register that

1388
00:58:33,900 --> 00:58:36,660
signs and issues and yes we

1389
00:58:36,660 --> 00:58:37,799
issue certificates do you have to

1390
00:58:37,799 --> 00:58:40,140
check if that 100 is there Yes exactly

1391
00:58:40,140 --> 00:58:41,880
so that's actually what we want to

1392
00:58:41,880 --> 00:58:44,160
do that you can also be on In the meantime

1393
00:58:44,160 --> 00:58:45,900
Events can be eh but you could also, for

1394
00:58:45,900 --> 00:58:47,280
example, be in  qwerty can see

1395
00:58:47,280 --> 00:58:50,960
if someone has the credits to eh

1396
00:58:50,960 --> 00:58:53,640
that he is actually oscp for

1397
00:58:53,640 --> 00:58:56,880
example or Ocean 42 website if you

1398
00:58:56,880 --> 00:58:58,440
are a set Fight aesthetically hard or something

1399
00:58:58,440 --> 00:59:01,200
all important things exactly so

1400
00:59:01,200 --> 00:59:03,119
that will be project cars that will

1401
00:59:03,119 --> 00:59:04,440
be added later in the year then

1402
00:59:04,440 --> 00:59:05,940
also be built a bit in the pelvis of the

1403

as the first eh

1428
01:00:13,220 --> 01:00:15,299
organization In the Netherlands next to the

government Can we offer online internships

1430
01:00:17,220 --> 01:00:20,220
so eh I thought about

1431
01:00:20,220 --> 01:00:23,000
starting with 10 and we now have 100

1432

121 Well we will train all of them

1433
01:00:25,559 --> 01:00:27,059
But there are just incredibly

1434
01:00:27,059 --> 01:00:29,520
powerful nice people  they can do a lot of

1435
01:00:29,520 --> 01:00:32,040
things eh and we are just going to

1436
01:00:32,040 --> 01:00:33,900
use them Yes and they have to go on an

1437
01:00:33,900 --> 01:00:36,720
internship at some point and they are going to

1438
01:00:36,720 --> 01:00:38,400
do a number of them So they are going to do an internship

1439
01:00:38,400 --> 01:00:40,319
for cat because they can think in terms of the

1440
01:00:40,319 --> 01:00:41,520
straps that hacking does they can

1441
01:00:41,520 --> 01:00:44,040
programming Well I just explained

1442
01:00:44,040 --> 01:00:45,900
how you

1443
01:00:45,900 --> 01:00:48,119

01:01:09,359 --> 01:01:11,839
uhm

1452
01:01:12,240 --> 01:01:14,520
people sometimes think this it's quite

1453
01:01:14,520 --> 01:01:15,960
complicated set of tools the best

1454
01:01:15,960 --> 01:01:18,059
complicated so actually we want to

1455
01:01:18,059 --> 01:01:19,859
have some kind of cat videos to

1456
01:01:19,859 --> 01:01:22,619
train people Well that's very cool Because there eh

1457
01:01:22,619 --> 01:01:24,240
Er  is namely an organization called

1458
01:01:24,240 --> 01:01:28,319
the DVD Academy and eh they are going to help us

1459
01:01:28,319 --> 01:01:31,619
make those kinds of videos

1460
01:01:31,619 --> 01:01:35,180
and then there is one more thing

1461
01:01:35,700 --> 01:01:38,099
because and a four has announced to

1462
01:01:38,099 --> 01:01:41,040

so eh yes that is just very cool

1466
01:01:48,059 --> 01:01:50,579

1467
01:01:50,579 --> 01:01:52,260


1468
01:01:52,260 --> 01:01:55,940

1499
01:03:15,180 --> 01:03:17,280


1500
01:03:17,280 --> 01:03:20,599

01:03:53,760 --> 01:03:55,859

1513
01:03:55,859 --> 01:03:56,450
ehm

1514
01:03:56,450 --> 01:03:58,380
[Music]

1515
01:03:58,380 --> 01:04:00,480
We have a lot of rascals around

1516
01:04:00,480 --> 01:04:02,099
voice over a Pi on the Rood with exist

1517
01:04:02,099 --> 01:04:03,599
because someone is very voice over a

1518
01:04:03,599 --> 01:04:05,099
beer enthusiast I did

1519
01:04:05,099 --> 01:04:07,260
n't immediately think of it myself but but eh that

1520
01:04:07,260 --> 01:04:11,339
example We are ehm  eh very

1521
01:04:11,339 --> 01:04:13,380
busy with medical equipment of course

1522
01:04:13,380 --> 01:04:15,839
yes and i don't know what you will build

1523
01:04:15,839 --> 01:04:18,140
of course

1524
01:04:23,400 --> 01:04:27,000
that smokes with available um There is a

1525
01:04:27,000 --> 01:04:29,819
red fake available eh but he is very

1526
01:04:29,819 --> 01:04:31,680
impressionable

1527
01:04:31,680 --> 01:04:33,900
so on the on the bigger things is too

1528
01:04:33,900 --> 01:04:35,579
big with now that we have procedures  want to

1529
01:04:35,579 --> 01:04:37,920
add so that now if you have an incident

1530
01:04:37,920 --> 01:04:39,480
you can also just say step by step

1531
01:04:39,480 --> 01:04:40,920
This is what you could do or

1532
01:04:40,920 --> 01:04:43,380
should do so that we also have forenties

1533
01:04:43,380 --> 01:04:45,359
birth setup existence and operation

1534
01:04:45,359 --> 01:04:48,599
how you deal with incidents um

1535
01:04:48,599 --> 01:04:50,819
that's a very big thing  second thing

1536
01:04:50,819 --> 01:04:52,740
ahead of the red belt is ehm

1537
01:04:52,740 --> 01:04:55,799
eh the file engine effectsalises risk

1538
01:04:55,799 --> 01:04:59,280
assessments eh and on and a third thing

1539
01:04:59,280 --> 01:05:01,500

1540
01:05:01,500 --> 01:05:05,520

1541
01:05:05,520 --> 01:05:06,900
is what model i would like to have

1542
01:05:06,900 --> 01:05:08,579
this belongs  so indeed a bit at home

1543
01:05:08,579 --> 01:05:11,099
so that he says in the in the engine

1544
01:05:11,099 --> 01:05:13,319

01:05:18,000 --> 01:05:20,460
standard is the first now in this already

1548

1549
01:05:22,619 --> 01:05:25,799
role, namely, ehm, I have arranged Cubanita in such a way

01:05:48,960 --> 01:05:51,140

1559
