00:00:00,299 --> 00:00:03,560
Nico dakins

2
00:00:03,720 --> 00:00:05,100
thank you

3
00:00:05,100 --> 00:00:07,080
thank everybody uh it's an honor for me

4
00:00:07,080 --> 00:00:08,519
to finally be here I wanted to be here

5
00:00:08,519 --> 00:00:10,559
for years but somehow my agenda didn't

6
00:00:10,559 --> 00:00:13,019
allow it so I'm very happy to be here so

7
00:00:13,019 --> 00:00:15,000
thanks for having me

8
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:18,119
um so I'll just start off with a little

9
00:00:18,119 --> 00:00:19,800
bit telling about uh to talk to you

10
00:00:19,800 --> 00:00:22,920
about who I am um so I'm an ocean

11
00:00:22,920 --> 00:00:24,900
specialist I was trained by the Dutch

12
00:00:24,900 --> 00:00:26,939
government so I was officially I was

13
00:00:26,939 --> 00:00:28,740
trained as an intelligence analyst for

14
00:00:28,740 --> 00:00:30,720
operational Technical and strategical

15
00:00:30,720 --> 00:00:33,420
analysts and I think around

16
00:00:33,420 --> 00:00:35,700
let's say halfway to 90s I discovered

17
00:00:35,700 --> 00:00:38,219
that hey the internet might stay here so

18
00:00:38,219 --> 00:00:40,920
let's start exploring that and at that

19
00:00:40,920 --> 00:00:43,140
time I was doing analysis on youth ganks

20
00:00:43,140 --> 00:00:45,180
in the Netherlands and I was I was like

21
00:00:45,180 --> 00:00:47,399
hey maybe those guys and girls are

22
00:00:47,399 --> 00:00:49,680
active on the internet and that's those

23
00:00:49,680 --> 00:00:51,660
street cops know a little bit about the

24
00:00:51,660 --> 00:00:53,100
criminals that they're dealing with but

25
00:00:53,100 --> 00:00:55,020
maybe by looking at an online footprint

26
00:00:55,020 --> 00:00:58,199
we can find let's say a different view

27
00:00:58,199 --> 00:01:00,239
of what they are doing and what how what

28
00:01:00,239 --> 00:01:02,280
connects them so that that's something

29
00:01:02,280 --> 00:01:03,780
that triggered me and luckily I had a

30
00:01:03,780 --> 00:01:05,640
team leader that basically said hey Nico

31
00:01:05,640 --> 00:01:07,619
here you have card launch uh here you

32
00:01:07,619 --> 00:01:10,140
have uh money for a laptop and start

33
00:01:10,140 --> 00:01:12,420
exploring this there were no rules there

34
00:01:12,420 --> 00:01:15,119
then so it was literally kindergarten

35
00:01:15,119 --> 00:01:16,979
for me I could do whatever I wanted to

36
00:01:16,979 --> 00:01:20,100
do so uh after that

37
00:01:20,100 --> 00:01:23,520
um I well after that it's really brief

38
00:01:23,520 --> 00:01:28,020
after 25 years I basically uh said hey I

39
00:01:28,020 --> 00:01:29,580
want to do more and the Dutch government

40
00:01:29,580 --> 00:01:31,680
said well we know you want to do more

41
00:01:31,680 --> 00:01:33,840
but we can't allow you to do more more

42
00:01:33,840 --> 00:01:36,659
so this is where basically our we had a

43
00:01:36,659 --> 00:01:38,880
divorce a little divorce I still am in

44
00:01:38,880 --> 00:01:40,380
close contact with a lot of the people

45
00:01:40,380 --> 00:01:42,780
that I work with but then I moved to

46
00:01:42,780 --> 00:01:44,700
bellingcat bellingcat an online

47
00:01:44,700 --> 00:01:47,460
investigative journalist Collective that

48
00:01:47,460 --> 00:01:48,900
do let's say all kinds of awesome

49
00:01:48,900 --> 00:01:51,720
research when it comes to war crimes and

50
00:01:51,720 --> 00:01:53,340
all that kind of stuff for example the

51
00:01:53,340 --> 00:01:56,040
mh-17 Downing they did some awesome work

52
00:01:56,040 --> 00:01:59,100
in there but that marriage again was not

53
00:01:59,100 --> 00:02:01,380
good enough for me because I was in the

54
00:02:01,380 --> 00:02:02,939
government and I was trained to have

55
00:02:02,939 --> 00:02:05,460
very strict operation security and

56
00:02:05,460 --> 00:02:07,439
within Bellingham that at that moment in

57
00:02:07,439 --> 00:02:10,080
time well was different let's put it

58
00:02:10,080 --> 00:02:12,660
like that so we were fished my daughter

59
00:02:12,660 --> 00:02:15,300
was fished and and my parents and my

60
00:02:15,300 --> 00:02:16,920
grandmother I was like well this is

61
00:02:16,920 --> 00:02:19,020
looking at what they do trying to find

62
00:02:19,020 --> 00:02:20,819
Russian hackers and Russian State

63
00:02:20,819 --> 00:02:23,220
Nationals well I like to brief and I

64
00:02:23,220 --> 00:02:25,800
would like to continue to do that so we

65
00:02:25,800 --> 00:02:27,720
had to go away I was in contact with

66
00:02:27,720 --> 00:02:29,340
some other people and I became a science

67
00:02:29,340 --> 00:02:32,280
instructor so I built courses for

68
00:02:32,280 --> 00:02:34,020
Science and Science Institute the United

69
00:02:34,020 --> 00:02:36,540
States company and now currently I run

70
00:02:36,540 --> 00:02:38,099
my own little shop called Dutch ocean

71
00:02:38,099 --> 00:02:40,560
guy and I recently moved over to shadow

72
00:02:40,560 --> 00:02:42,540
dragon a company basically that built

73
00:02:42,540 --> 00:02:44,280
some scalable tools for open source

74
00:02:44,280 --> 00:02:46,140
intelligence but enough about me at

75
00:02:46,140 --> 00:02:47,879
least now you know a little bit who I am

76
00:02:47,879 --> 00:02:49,980
but feel free to ask me more questions

77
00:02:49,980 --> 00:02:52,140
I'll be here the entire weekend so uh

78
00:02:52,140 --> 00:02:55,080
don't be afraid I won't buy it at least

79
00:02:55,080 --> 00:02:57,780
I promise I won't buy it a little bit

80
00:02:57,780 --> 00:02:59,400
about open source intelligence and for

81
00:02:59,400 --> 00:03:00,720
those who have never heard about open

82
00:03:00,720 --> 00:03:02,220
source intelligence open source

83
00:03:02,220 --> 00:03:03,920
intelligence is

84
00:03:03,920 --> 00:03:06,360
collecting and processing but more

85
00:03:06,360 --> 00:03:08,940
importantly analyzing information that

86
00:03:08,940 --> 00:03:10,680
is coming from open sources that

87
00:03:10,680 --> 00:03:13,080
addresses an intelligence requirement so

88
00:03:13,080 --> 00:03:14,879
it always starts with a question that

89
00:03:14,879 --> 00:03:16,500
someone wants to have an answer or

90
00:03:16,500 --> 00:03:18,360
multiple answers to and based upon that

91
00:03:18,360 --> 00:03:21,060
you start looking on let's say the

92
00:03:21,060 --> 00:03:22,800
internet but not only the internet could

93
00:03:22,800 --> 00:03:25,260
also be traditional newspapers or TV or

94
00:03:25,260 --> 00:03:27,780
a library and open source intelligence

95
00:03:27,780 --> 00:03:31,019
does not limit itself to let's say the

96
00:03:31,019 --> 00:03:32,940
service internet the Deep Web the dark

97
00:03:32,940 --> 00:03:36,120
web but also resources that you may need

98
00:03:36,120 --> 00:03:38,519
to pay a little bit of money for so an

99
00:03:38,519 --> 00:03:41,580
open source for me and we can have a

100
00:03:41,580 --> 00:03:43,440
large debate about it but it will not do

101
00:03:43,440 --> 00:03:45,720
that now an open source must be a source

102
00:03:45,720 --> 00:03:48,120
that is accessible for anyone around the

103
00:03:48,120 --> 00:03:50,220
world depending of course a little bit

104
00:03:50,220 --> 00:03:52,379
on their budget sometimes but it should

105
00:03:52,379 --> 00:03:54,000
be a source that

106
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:56,159
your neighbor should also be able to

107
00:03:56,159 --> 00:03:57,840
find as long as they have the proper

108
00:03:57,840 --> 00:03:59,400
skill set and the proper hardware and

109
00:03:59,400 --> 00:04:00,900
software to do that

110
00:04:00,900 --> 00:04:03,239
so that inspired me and I've been doing

111
00:04:03,239 --> 00:04:05,519
this for well almost 30 years now

112
00:04:05,519 --> 00:04:08,159
already yes I'm that old and you can see

113
00:04:08,159 --> 00:04:10,319
by this little uh Google graph that

114
00:04:10,319 --> 00:04:12,840
there is a a little Trend when it comes

115
00:04:12,840 --> 00:04:14,580
to open source intelligence so the blue

116
00:04:14,580 --> 00:04:16,798
line is open source intelligence and

117
00:04:16,798 --> 00:04:19,199
open source intelligence has risen and

118
00:04:19,199 --> 00:04:22,139
it has to do with a lot of Wars a lot of

119
00:04:22,139 --> 00:04:24,660
um other things where people started to

120
00:04:24,660 --> 00:04:26,759
see opportunities with exploring the

121
00:04:26,759 --> 00:04:29,100
internet to mostly for accountability

122
00:04:29,100 --> 00:04:31,740
kind of research where you want to find

123
00:04:31,740 --> 00:04:33,780
something maybe in hacker group maybe

124
00:04:33,780 --> 00:04:35,520
again a criminal group maybe something

125
00:04:35,520 --> 00:04:37,740
related to war and you can use those

126
00:04:37,740 --> 00:04:40,380
sources to tell a story in essence so

127
00:04:40,380 --> 00:04:42,479
it's a used growth Market but everything

128
00:04:42,479 --> 00:04:45,240
starts always for me with the General

129
00:04:45,240 --> 00:04:47,160
open source intelligence or let's say

130
00:04:47,160 --> 00:04:49,680
the traditional intelligence cycle I

131
00:04:49,680 --> 00:04:52,139
cannot do any research without a

132
00:04:52,139 --> 00:04:54,360
question so without questions I will

133
00:04:54,360 --> 00:04:56,580
never have answers for you so it always

134
00:04:56,580 --> 00:04:59,040
starts with planning and Direction so I

135
00:04:59,040 --> 00:05:01,380
talked to a client I talk to someone and

136
00:05:01,380 --> 00:05:03,960
I asked him what do you want me to find

137
00:05:03,960 --> 00:05:06,180
out and on average table tells Nico I

138
00:05:06,180 --> 00:05:07,800
want everything

139
00:05:07,800 --> 00:05:10,139
yeah but what's everything yeah

140
00:05:10,139 --> 00:05:11,639
everything you can find on the internet

141
00:05:11,639 --> 00:05:14,400
yeah so okay give me a couple of

142
00:05:14,400 --> 00:05:16,080
petabytes of data storage and I will

143
00:05:16,080 --> 00:05:17,699
collect everything and you can short it

144
00:05:17,699 --> 00:05:18,780
out yourself

145
00:05:18,780 --> 00:05:21,780
but that's not how it works so you need

146
00:05:21,780 --> 00:05:23,880
to take mostly clients by the hand and

147
00:05:23,880 --> 00:05:25,440
deliberately ask them hey

148
00:05:25,440 --> 00:05:27,660
if there's one thing that you want to

149
00:05:27,660 --> 00:05:30,479
have an answer to what do what would

150
00:05:30,479 --> 00:05:32,880
that be well for example did Nico visit

151
00:05:32,880 --> 00:05:35,699
hacker hotel in 2023 that's a question

152
00:05:35,699 --> 00:05:38,580
that I can work with so with that you

153
00:05:38,580 --> 00:05:40,680
basically start building your tools you

154
00:05:40,680 --> 00:05:43,020
start scoping what's in limitations

155
00:05:43,020 --> 00:05:45,419
what's out of the limitations how to

156
00:05:45,419 --> 00:05:47,460
secure my computers for operation

157
00:05:47,460 --> 00:05:49,919
security is pretty important because I

158
00:05:49,919 --> 00:05:51,600
have something to hide for a net from an

159
00:05:51,600 --> 00:05:53,699
adversary and then we start collecting

160
00:05:53,699 --> 00:05:55,979
the data and collecting the data means

161
00:05:55,979 --> 00:05:57,900
that we will look in numerous places to

162
00:05:57,900 --> 00:05:59,940
see pieces of the puzzle and those

163
00:05:59,940 --> 00:06:02,039
pieces of the Apostle very often come in

164
00:06:02,039 --> 00:06:04,740
sub-optimal for formatting so we need to

165
00:06:04,740 --> 00:06:07,020
process and exploit the data then we

166
00:06:07,020 --> 00:06:09,180
analyze it and most of the times we take

167
00:06:09,180 --> 00:06:11,340
a step back because when we analyze the

168
00:06:11,340 --> 00:06:13,139
information we will see that we have

169
00:06:13,139 --> 00:06:16,020
gaps in our information so we go back to

170
00:06:16,020 --> 00:06:17,940
the scoping and so on it's an endless

171
00:06:17,940 --> 00:06:19,979
loop until we have satisfied our needs

172
00:06:19,979 --> 00:06:23,520
so very brief but mostly when I look at

173
00:06:23,520 --> 00:06:26,100
my research and I really love off this

174
00:06:26,100 --> 00:06:28,440
quote by Einstein because it says hey if

175
00:06:28,440 --> 00:06:30,600
I had an only one hour to solve a

176
00:06:30,600 --> 00:06:33,539
problem I would like to use the first 55

177
00:06:33,539 --> 00:06:35,400
minutes to start thinking about that

178
00:06:35,400 --> 00:06:37,800
problem properly thinking about that

179
00:06:37,800 --> 00:06:39,960
problem preferably with a group of

180
00:06:39,960 --> 00:06:42,240
people that are not always necessarily

181
00:06:42,240 --> 00:06:43,860
open Church intelligence specialist

182
00:06:43,860 --> 00:06:45,960
because I like to listen to different

183
00:06:45,960 --> 00:06:47,819
angles different perspectives and with

184
00:06:47,819 --> 00:06:50,160
that potentially then I could solve that

185
00:06:50,160 --> 00:06:52,199
puzzle within the five minutes because

186
00:06:52,199 --> 00:06:54,240
now we have a good attack plan we know

187
00:06:54,240 --> 00:06:56,280
where to look but more importantly we

188
00:06:56,280 --> 00:06:58,919
know where not to look and that's I

189
00:06:58,919 --> 00:07:00,360
think the biggest challenge within open

190
00:07:00,360 --> 00:07:01,740
source intelligence because there are

191
00:07:01,740 --> 00:07:03,780
too many too many rabbit holes to go

192
00:07:03,780 --> 00:07:04,680
into

193
00:07:04,680 --> 00:07:07,199
now when we when we look at the history

194
00:07:07,199 --> 00:07:09,180
when we look at where well this was

195
00:07:09,180 --> 00:07:11,759
before I was born but open source

196
00:07:11,759 --> 00:07:14,100
intelligence has its roots

197
00:07:14,100 --> 00:07:16,259
um probably around World War II so I did

198
00:07:16,259 --> 00:07:18,900
a lot of research seeing looking at when

199
00:07:18,900 --> 00:07:20,699
people starting started to talk about

200
00:07:20,699 --> 00:07:23,460
open source intelligence the actual word

201
00:07:23,460 --> 00:07:26,940
so we noticed that mostly during World

202
00:07:26,940 --> 00:07:29,099
War World War One people started

203
00:07:29,099 --> 00:07:31,080
gathering information from newspapers

204
00:07:31,080 --> 00:07:34,860
from radio from libraries from other

205
00:07:34,860 --> 00:07:37,319
broadcasts or singles interceptions that

206
00:07:37,319 --> 00:07:39,479
they could do and that was the first

207
00:07:39,479 --> 00:07:41,400
start of Open Source intelligence this

208
00:07:41,400 --> 00:07:43,560
is how it started it was a lot of manual

209
00:07:43,560 --> 00:07:46,440
work a lot of manual processing of data

210
00:07:46,440 --> 00:07:48,479
and that became more and more

211
00:07:48,479 --> 00:07:49,680
challenging

212
00:07:49,680 --> 00:07:52,139
um of course the early 90s when the

213
00:07:52,139 --> 00:07:54,900
internet started to begin and started to

214
00:07:54,900 --> 00:07:56,039
become a little bit more let's say

215
00:07:56,039 --> 00:07:58,740
mainstream open source and Jones became

216
00:07:58,740 --> 00:08:01,199
more standard became more adopted and

217
00:08:01,199 --> 00:08:04,020
but also it was still mostly done by

218
00:08:04,020 --> 00:08:05,460
governments within the intelligence

219
00:08:05,460 --> 00:08:07,800
Community not necessarily by let's say

220
00:08:07,800 --> 00:08:10,199
people like you and me that do normal

221
00:08:10,199 --> 00:08:12,900
day jobs and just like to spend time to

222
00:08:12,900 --> 00:08:14,699
puzzle puzzle all the time because

223
00:08:14,699 --> 00:08:17,220
that's what I do the entire day so when

224
00:08:17,220 --> 00:08:19,979
I look at the past 25 years we look at

225
00:08:19,979 --> 00:08:23,039
the 911 Tax we we look at the Arabic

226
00:08:23,039 --> 00:08:25,160
spring that was around

227
00:08:25,160 --> 00:08:29,580
2009 where we saw that people used

228
00:08:29,580 --> 00:08:31,919
phones and internet connectivity to

229
00:08:31,919 --> 00:08:34,500
spread the word to show that there was

230
00:08:34,500 --> 00:08:36,240
something going on in the world and with

231
00:08:36,240 --> 00:08:39,240
that we can now help certain groups

232
00:08:39,240 --> 00:08:41,880
accountable for certain wrongdoings so

233
00:08:41,880 --> 00:08:44,219
with that it gained way more momentum

234
00:08:44,219 --> 00:08:46,380
and we could see that the rise of social

235
00:08:46,380 --> 00:08:49,740
media became wider and wider it became a

236
00:08:49,740 --> 00:08:51,779
global adopted phenomena where people

237
00:08:51,779 --> 00:08:53,700
wanted to use their devices to

238
00:08:53,700 --> 00:08:55,200
communicate with other people all around

239
00:08:55,200 --> 00:08:58,440
the world so that gave me eyes and ears

240
00:08:58,440 --> 00:09:00,600
everywhere that's basically how I look

241
00:09:00,600 --> 00:09:02,640
at the internet because if I want to

242
00:09:02,640 --> 00:09:04,800
find someone a criminal so recently I

243
00:09:04,800 --> 00:09:07,320
was looking into some Russian spies that

244
00:09:07,320 --> 00:09:08,700
were caught in Sweden so there was

245
00:09:08,700 --> 00:09:11,279
nothing more than a news article on the

246
00:09:11,279 --> 00:09:14,040
Swedish news I was like hey I can see a

247
00:09:14,040 --> 00:09:15,360
villa that they're lifting I can

248
00:09:15,360 --> 00:09:17,580
geolocate that and then I could

249
00:09:17,580 --> 00:09:19,440
geolocate it I found the location and

250
00:09:19,440 --> 00:09:20,640
then I could point maybe some

251
00:09:20,640 --> 00:09:22,680
geolocation tools on it that showed me

252
00:09:22,680 --> 00:09:25,440
that there were telegram users active

253
00:09:25,440 --> 00:09:27,420
in those coordinates of those building

254
00:09:27,420 --> 00:09:30,480
so with that I found user accounts those

255
00:09:30,480 --> 00:09:32,880
user accounts had usernames those

256
00:09:32,880 --> 00:09:34,980
usernames were unique and with that I

257
00:09:34,980 --> 00:09:37,740
could find new people that we didn't

258
00:09:37,740 --> 00:09:39,899
know about we found businesses we found

259
00:09:39,899 --> 00:09:42,420
so much more that was originally in that

260
00:09:42,420 --> 00:09:45,060
news article and with that you now know

261
00:09:45,060 --> 00:09:49,380
where those spice were active for at

262
00:09:49,380 --> 00:09:51,420
least 12 years in in and around Sweden

263
00:09:51,420 --> 00:09:53,519
who they were with who they did business

264
00:09:53,519 --> 00:09:56,040
with because all those businesses are in

265
00:09:56,040 --> 00:09:58,860
open sources all their traces on social

266
00:09:58,860 --> 00:10:01,399
media even though they used aliases

267
00:10:01,399 --> 00:10:05,220
still are traces which I can use they

268
00:10:05,220 --> 00:10:07,800
leave behind so much valuable nuggets

269
00:10:07,800 --> 00:10:10,140
that I can use but we see that the

270
00:10:10,140 --> 00:10:12,180
landscape is Shifting this is in the

271
00:10:12,180 --> 00:10:14,040
time where there was little to no

272
00:10:14,040 --> 00:10:16,500
encryption there was people were not

273
00:10:16,500 --> 00:10:18,360
that aware of people that they were

274
00:10:18,360 --> 00:10:20,100
looking at them

275
00:10:20,100 --> 00:10:22,860
um could be me could be a nation state

276
00:10:22,860 --> 00:10:25,320
could be a law enforcement agency but

277
00:10:25,320 --> 00:10:27,300
things are now changing so when we look

278
00:10:27,300 --> 00:10:29,459
at slowly where we are going

279
00:10:29,459 --> 00:10:31,620
when we look at the past it will always

280
00:10:31,620 --> 00:10:34,500
matter to me because a criminal or a

281
00:10:34,500 --> 00:10:36,899
hacker was not born as a criminal or a

282
00:10:36,899 --> 00:10:39,779
hacker that was doing let's say wrong

283
00:10:39,779 --> 00:10:41,399
negative things because that's mostly

284
00:10:41,399 --> 00:10:43,200
what I do I try to trace down let's say

285
00:10:43,200 --> 00:10:45,060
the back people or at least I think I

286
00:10:45,060 --> 00:10:46,560
strongly believe that those are bad

287
00:10:46,560 --> 00:10:47,519
people

288
00:10:47,519 --> 00:10:49,440
but when we look at that

289
00:10:49,440 --> 00:10:51,660
they order pizzas so bad guys order

290
00:10:51,660 --> 00:10:54,420
pizzas too so we can find information

291
00:10:54,420 --> 00:10:57,000
about that so we can find their human

292
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:58,980
footprint we can find their company

293
00:10:58,980 --> 00:11:01,500
footprint before they were operational

294
00:11:01,500 --> 00:11:04,620
security aware so with that I could map

295
00:11:04,620 --> 00:11:06,420
out maybe their Network their friends

296
00:11:06,420 --> 00:11:08,519
their connectivity the devices that they

297
00:11:08,519 --> 00:11:10,800
used and with that I can learn more and

298
00:11:10,800 --> 00:11:12,720
more about those targets to specifically

299
00:11:12,720 --> 00:11:15,360
pivot into that intelligence requirement

300
00:11:15,360 --> 00:11:17,700
now when we look at the present and this

301
00:11:17,700 --> 00:11:19,380
is kind of mimicking my younger's

302
00:11:19,380 --> 00:11:22,079
daughter they are so sensitive for shiny

303
00:11:22,079 --> 00:11:24,720
new apps and they never read the terms

304
00:11:24,720 --> 00:11:26,940
of services but most of those terms of

305
00:11:26,940 --> 00:11:29,700
services will clear state will clay will

306
00:11:29,700 --> 00:11:31,740
clearly state

307
00:11:31,740 --> 00:11:33,839
what you are sharing what kind of

308
00:11:33,839 --> 00:11:35,279
information is out there and that

309
00:11:35,279 --> 00:11:37,860
information very often I can find in

310
00:11:37,860 --> 00:11:40,680
open sources or open databases and with

311
00:11:40,680 --> 00:11:44,100
that you find again a human footprint

312
00:11:44,100 --> 00:11:46,860
maybe company information before Labor

313
00:11:46,860 --> 00:11:49,440
operation should secure little small

314
00:11:49,440 --> 00:11:51,240
little funny Side Story since I'm still

315
00:11:51,240 --> 00:11:53,640
talking about my daughter my oldest

316
00:11:53,640 --> 00:11:55,560
daughter she's now 15 she's in high

317
00:11:55,560 --> 00:11:57,779
school she just texted me 10 minutes ago

318
00:11:57,779 --> 00:12:00,720
that we need to talk I think I hacked

319
00:12:00,720 --> 00:12:02,940
the school system and I can change my

320
00:12:02,940 --> 00:12:06,300
grade I'm like oh and I'm I'm definitely

321
00:12:06,300 --> 00:12:07,740
not a hacker there are a lot of people

322
00:12:07,740 --> 00:12:10,019
in here that that are way way better and

323
00:12:10,019 --> 00:12:13,019
I'm like well stop

324
00:12:13,019 --> 00:12:15,660
email your Mentor tell them what you did

325
00:12:15,660 --> 00:12:18,180
give yourself a 10. so the highest grade

326
00:12:18,180 --> 00:12:21,060
in Dutch and we to our Monday morning we

327
00:12:21,060 --> 00:12:23,700
will go to school and I will help you

328
00:12:23,700 --> 00:12:25,680
out here we need to do some responsible

329
00:12:25,680 --> 00:12:27,899
disclosure here because something might

330
00:12:27,899 --> 00:12:30,959
be misconfigured but just for me that

331
00:12:30,959 --> 00:12:32,640
also shows that

332
00:12:32,640 --> 00:12:34,920
when you look at this she used some

333
00:12:34,920 --> 00:12:36,899
techniques that I taught her because

334
00:12:36,899 --> 00:12:38,700
well I've built courses and I've been

335
00:12:38,700 --> 00:12:40,680
like hey here are the course books go

336
00:12:40,680 --> 00:12:42,959
explore and she was like oh I could do

337
00:12:42,959 --> 00:12:45,540
some URL manipulation to find something

338
00:12:45,540 --> 00:12:47,820
and with that she probably discovered

339
00:12:47,820 --> 00:12:49,380
some but I'll need to find out a little

340
00:12:49,380 --> 00:12:51,240
bit more details because maybe I need to

341
00:12:51,240 --> 00:12:53,160
confiscate her PlayStation just to make

342
00:12:53,160 --> 00:12:56,040
a statement No hacking

343
00:12:56,040 --> 00:12:57,899
um

344
00:12:57,899 --> 00:13:00,300
so when it comes to open source

345
00:13:00,300 --> 00:13:03,240
intelligence the present for me when you

346
00:13:03,240 --> 00:13:05,100
look at some numbers that I that I've

347
00:13:05,100 --> 00:13:07,139
that I've basically looked up

348
00:13:07,139 --> 00:13:07,740
um

349
00:13:07,740 --> 00:13:10,440
this is my biggest problem now the

350
00:13:10,440 --> 00:13:12,540
population in the world is around 8

351
00:13:12,540 --> 00:13:15,180
billion people we have more than 5

352
00:13:15,180 --> 00:13:17,579
billion uh unique mobile users all

353
00:13:17,579 --> 00:13:19,920
around the world we have 5 billion

354
00:13:19,920 --> 00:13:22,380
internet users and we have

355
00:13:22,380 --> 00:13:24,240
um almost four and a half or just over

356
00:13:24,240 --> 00:13:26,160
four and a half billion active social

357
00:13:26,160 --> 00:13:29,160
media users which means if I need to

358
00:13:29,160 --> 00:13:31,740
find that one little nugget when someone

359
00:13:31,740 --> 00:13:34,860
is saying hey I am planning a bombing

360
00:13:34,860 --> 00:13:36,839
because I did a lot of counter terrorism

361
00:13:36,839 --> 00:13:39,300
work I'm part of a terrorism cell how do

362
00:13:39,300 --> 00:13:41,760
you find that one person that makes that

363
00:13:41,760 --> 00:13:44,399
statement somewhere online on one

364
00:13:44,399 --> 00:13:46,920
particular maybe hidden platform how do

365
00:13:46,920 --> 00:13:48,839
I find that that's my biggest challenge

366
00:13:48,839 --> 00:13:50,940
now in the presence where do I even

367
00:13:50,940 --> 00:13:53,700
start to look and if I know where to

368
00:13:53,700 --> 00:13:56,639
look how can I hide myself in such a way

369
00:13:56,639 --> 00:13:58,700
that those people are not immediately

370
00:13:58,700 --> 00:14:01,440
alarmed so that's one of the biggest

371
00:14:01,440 --> 00:14:03,600
challenges so when I look at that

372
00:14:03,600 --> 00:14:06,480
concept the present is also for me

373
00:14:06,480 --> 00:14:08,880
looking at best top devices versus

374
00:14:08,880 --> 00:14:11,100
remote versus mobile because mobile

375
00:14:11,100 --> 00:14:14,160
devices give at least for most open

376
00:14:14,160 --> 00:14:16,079
source intelligence partitions A new

377
00:14:16,079 --> 00:14:18,899
challenge it's way harder to step up

378
00:14:18,899 --> 00:14:20,459
your operation Security on a mobile

379
00:14:20,459 --> 00:14:22,380
device because there's a lot of more

380
00:14:22,380 --> 00:14:24,959
Telemetry going on GPS chips building

381
00:14:24,959 --> 00:14:27,000
that cannot always be turned off by

382
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:29,279
default so that means something for my

383
00:14:29,279 --> 00:14:32,279
investigations wearables also a new

384
00:14:32,279 --> 00:14:34,560
challenge the emit all kind of singles

385
00:14:34,560 --> 00:14:36,899
they connect to all kind of stuff it

386
00:14:36,899 --> 00:14:39,180
gives us chances but also challenges for

387
00:14:39,180 --> 00:14:42,240
me to find information but with that I

388
00:14:42,240 --> 00:14:44,279
can now also use the power of the crowd

389
00:14:44,279 --> 00:14:45,660
and that's something that for example

390
00:14:45,660 --> 00:14:47,279
the the group that I was part of

391
00:14:47,279 --> 00:14:49,320
bellingcat uses they use people all

392
00:14:49,320 --> 00:14:51,480
around the world armchair internet

393
00:14:51,480 --> 00:14:53,579
investigators what what Elliot Higgins

394
00:14:53,579 --> 00:14:56,100
calls it to basically spend time and

395
00:14:56,100 --> 00:14:58,560
help out in certain investigations but

396
00:14:58,560 --> 00:15:01,320
that also brings a risk because do you

397
00:15:01,320 --> 00:15:02,820
know if you can trust the people that

398
00:15:02,820 --> 00:15:04,260
are in that crowd that are helping you

399
00:15:04,260 --> 00:15:06,959
so there are a lot of challenges I can

400
00:15:06,959 --> 00:15:08,040
also see that

401
00:15:08,040 --> 00:15:10,139
when you look at the early stage of the

402
00:15:10,139 --> 00:15:13,139
internet it was mainly text based that

403
00:15:13,139 --> 00:15:16,380
is for me way more easy to look into for

404
00:15:16,380 --> 00:15:18,360
example when we compare two pictures or

405
00:15:18,360 --> 00:15:19,380
videos

406
00:15:19,380 --> 00:15:22,740
so with videos it brings new challenges

407
00:15:22,740 --> 00:15:24,600
because one minute of the video that can

408
00:15:24,600 --> 00:15:27,240
happen an awful lot in the video that I

409
00:15:27,240 --> 00:15:30,060
now need to find and geolocate yesterday

410
00:15:30,060 --> 00:15:33,600
there was a um a Nazi group that was

411
00:15:33,600 --> 00:15:37,260
streaming a laser kind of uh thing on

412
00:15:37,260 --> 00:15:40,079
the Anne Frank house in Amsterdam so I

413
00:15:40,079 --> 00:15:42,899
I'm under cover in that telegram group

414
00:15:42,899 --> 00:15:45,060
where they are and

415
00:15:45,060 --> 00:15:47,820
there is no coincidence but I was

416
00:15:47,820 --> 00:15:49,380
reached out by a Dutch journalist

417
00:15:49,380 --> 00:15:51,720
earlier today and he was like hey I

418
00:15:51,720 --> 00:15:54,240
found that video and they stopped at a

419
00:15:54,240 --> 00:15:56,760
gas station that's a very specific gas

420
00:15:56,760 --> 00:15:58,800
station Nico can you help me geolocate

421
00:15:58,800 --> 00:16:00,959
it and there's no coincidence I was

422
00:16:00,959 --> 00:16:03,240
filling up my tank before driving here

423
00:16:03,240 --> 00:16:06,000
and I was at that gas station so he

424
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:07,740
literally I was like how do you know

425
00:16:07,740 --> 00:16:10,380
where I am man how so I took a picture

426
00:16:10,380 --> 00:16:12,360
of this location yes that's the location

427
00:16:12,360 --> 00:16:15,600
we found it but also if I would not had

428
00:16:15,600 --> 00:16:17,399
that luck I could have found that

429
00:16:17,399 --> 00:16:18,959
location in under five minutes because

430
00:16:18,959 --> 00:16:20,820
it was a Shell gas station it was

431
00:16:20,820 --> 00:16:23,220
clearly a Starbucks visible in the

432
00:16:23,220 --> 00:16:25,139
reflection of the mirror there are only

433
00:16:25,139 --> 00:16:26,880
nine Shell stations in Netherlands that

434
00:16:26,880 --> 00:16:29,160
have Starbucks and with that it's just

435
00:16:29,160 --> 00:16:31,199
well basically excluding the ones that

436
00:16:31,199 --> 00:16:33,180
do not match up one-on-one with the

437
00:16:33,180 --> 00:16:34,980
picture and you can find that location

438
00:16:34,980 --> 00:16:37,380
so funny story

439
00:16:37,380 --> 00:16:38,040
um

440
00:16:38,040 --> 00:16:40,199
things that I need to deal with that I

441
00:16:40,199 --> 00:16:40,980
will

442
00:16:40,980 --> 00:16:43,199
also show you some examples of in just a

443
00:16:43,199 --> 00:16:45,120
moment is for example artificial

444
00:16:45,120 --> 00:16:47,339
manipulation so deep fakes or filters

445
00:16:47,339 --> 00:16:49,860
that we have on Snapchat those are

446
00:16:49,860 --> 00:16:51,420
becoming a real challenge so everything

447
00:16:51,420 --> 00:16:55,579
that stylegan or Dolly orientated will

448
00:16:55,579 --> 00:16:58,440
form a bigger challenge for people

449
00:16:58,440 --> 00:17:00,360
trying to tackle for example this

450
00:17:00,360 --> 00:17:02,040
information and there's a lot of this

451
00:17:02,040 --> 00:17:04,079
information going on and fake news going

452
00:17:04,079 --> 00:17:07,380
on digital Warfare where we see a lot of

453
00:17:07,380 --> 00:17:09,799
groups all around the world attacking

454
00:17:09,799 --> 00:17:11,819
infrastructure and that kind of stuff

455
00:17:11,819 --> 00:17:14,579
again every move that they make they

456
00:17:14,579 --> 00:17:16,619
leave behind traces and those traces

457
00:17:16,619 --> 00:17:18,419
could be in open source it's definitely

458
00:17:18,419 --> 00:17:21,179
not always but it's least something that

459
00:17:21,179 --> 00:17:23,040
I can work with maybe we have a red team

460
00:17:23,040 --> 00:17:26,040
or another team that can feed me certain

461
00:17:26,040 --> 00:17:28,260
pieces of information that I can use and

462
00:17:28,260 --> 00:17:31,140
do my let's say skill set upon to find

463
00:17:31,140 --> 00:17:32,760
maybe a little bit more

464
00:17:32,760 --> 00:17:34,980
but I think the biggest challenge now is

465
00:17:34,980 --> 00:17:38,220
for me that I used to be able to do

466
00:17:38,220 --> 00:17:40,679
everything manually but I need to start

467
00:17:40,679 --> 00:17:42,539
automating more stuff because there's

468
00:17:42,539 --> 00:17:44,580
simply too much information out there

469
00:17:44,580 --> 00:17:46,320
for me to deal with

470
00:17:46,320 --> 00:17:49,020
so when we look at that I need to make

471
00:17:49,020 --> 00:17:51,539
use of hackathons so hackathons where

472
00:17:51,539 --> 00:17:53,520
well just like an event like this where

473
00:17:53,520 --> 00:17:55,440
you get a group of like-minded people

474
00:17:55,440 --> 00:17:57,419
you throw them a challenge and you say

475
00:17:57,419 --> 00:17:59,640
hey let's solve this puzzle we need to

476
00:17:59,640 --> 00:18:01,440
find the people who are responsible for

477
00:18:01,440 --> 00:18:03,780
the Downing of the mh-17 here is video

478
00:18:03,780 --> 00:18:06,120
footage here's some other footage now

479
00:18:06,120 --> 00:18:08,580
let's find some stuff so Community

480
00:18:08,580 --> 00:18:10,860
Driven research is really helping in

481
00:18:10,860 --> 00:18:13,980
that and with that you also have Global

482
00:18:13,980 --> 00:18:17,940
availability 24 7 365 because well I

483
00:18:17,940 --> 00:18:19,919
like to sleep every now and then but

484
00:18:19,919 --> 00:18:21,539
someone at the other side of the pond

485
00:18:21,539 --> 00:18:24,240
can continue my work but also they can

486
00:18:24,240 --> 00:18:26,160
maybe deal with a different language or

487
00:18:26,160 --> 00:18:27,840
different different character sets that

488
00:18:27,840 --> 00:18:31,260
I cannot deal with so that brings a

489
00:18:31,260 --> 00:18:33,419
little bit of power back to what I need

490
00:18:33,419 --> 00:18:35,280
now just showing you one little example

491
00:18:35,280 --> 00:18:38,760
on uh the power of working as a

492
00:18:38,760 --> 00:18:40,679
collective on an open source

493
00:18:40,679 --> 00:18:42,960
intelligence case I'm going to show you

494
00:18:42,960 --> 00:18:45,299
a case study from uh my time at

495
00:18:45,299 --> 00:18:48,179
ballingcat where there was an execution

496
00:18:48,179 --> 00:18:50,640
by a rebel group a rebel leader called

497
00:18:50,640 --> 00:18:52,500
Mr Oliver Folly and this was the first

498
00:18:52,500 --> 00:18:54,900
case where open source intelligence

499
00:18:54,900 --> 00:18:57,539
information led to the conviction with

500
00:18:57,539 --> 00:19:00,299
in the international crime court so what

501
00:19:00,299 --> 00:19:02,299
happened here there was a rebel leader

502
00:19:02,299 --> 00:19:04,919
who had a bunch of captives and they

503
00:19:04,919 --> 00:19:07,380
were brutally executed at a given

504
00:19:07,380 --> 00:19:09,780
location that footage was found and

505
00:19:09,780 --> 00:19:11,760
basically handed over to bellingcat and

506
00:19:11,760 --> 00:19:13,980
basically for accountability we wanted

507
00:19:13,980 --> 00:19:16,440
to prove a point and say we want to

508
00:19:16,440 --> 00:19:19,200
prove who we're involved where but more

509
00:19:19,200 --> 00:19:21,900
importantly when exactly because we

510
00:19:21,900 --> 00:19:24,299
needed to find evidence so let me show

511
00:19:24,299 --> 00:19:26,520
you the video and I will slowly walk you

512
00:19:26,520 --> 00:19:28,940
through that

513
00:19:30,299 --> 00:19:34,260
so what we used is a bunch of let's say

514
00:19:34,260 --> 00:19:36,600
leads and pivot Points so here you see

515
00:19:36,600 --> 00:19:39,240
him basically reading his sentence to

516
00:19:39,240 --> 00:19:41,100
the people who are going to get murdered

517
00:19:41,100 --> 00:19:43,200
we will not show the horrific stuff but

518
00:19:43,200 --> 00:19:45,600
based upon that we could extract Stills

519
00:19:45,600 --> 00:19:47,820
so we could extract little screenshots

520
00:19:47,820 --> 00:19:50,220
together that we piece together in a

521
00:19:50,220 --> 00:19:51,840
panorama because we wanted to have a

522
00:19:51,840 --> 00:19:54,539
good overview of that situation so if

523
00:19:54,539 --> 00:19:56,640
you grab those Stills and you stitch

524
00:19:56,640 --> 00:19:58,799
them all together you basically get a

525
00:19:58,799 --> 00:20:01,620
broader perspective and you use that as

526
00:20:01,620 --> 00:20:03,120
little pieces of the Apostle to

527
00:20:03,120 --> 00:20:06,120
geolocate that specific location so

528
00:20:06,120 --> 00:20:08,160
there are things that you can see you

529
00:20:08,160 --> 00:20:09,960
can see for example

530
00:20:09,960 --> 00:20:12,000
um a fork in the road or you can see

531
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:15,000
some specific buildings we can see that

532
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:16,620
there are so is a wall there are some

533
00:20:16,620 --> 00:20:18,500
bushes and there's a fork in the road

534
00:20:18,500 --> 00:20:21,480
all these things added up create a

535
00:20:21,480 --> 00:20:24,000
unique fingerprint of that location now

536
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:25,799
we knew that it was somewhere in

537
00:20:25,799 --> 00:20:28,980
Benghazi but that's a really broad

538
00:20:28,980 --> 00:20:32,640
province that is let's say 500 500

539
00:20:32,640 --> 00:20:35,039
kilometers in square so that means that

540
00:20:35,039 --> 00:20:37,260
we need to find that so we've tried to

541
00:20:37,260 --> 00:20:38,520
look for similar looking building

542
00:20:38,520 --> 00:20:40,559
buildings to narrow down that rough

543
00:20:40,559 --> 00:20:41,700
location

544
00:20:41,700 --> 00:20:44,640
so we found a rough location but we

545
00:20:44,640 --> 00:20:46,919
still needed to validate where exactly

546
00:20:46,919 --> 00:20:49,679
did this incident happen so with a team

547
00:20:49,679 --> 00:20:52,500
of 10 people 10 hours a day at least we

548
00:20:52,500 --> 00:20:55,740
started basically Scavenging Google Maps

549
00:20:55,740 --> 00:20:58,020
meter by meter so we created little

550
00:20:58,020 --> 00:21:00,600
grits and we gave every team member a

551
00:21:00,600 --> 00:21:02,700
task look at this part look at this part

552
00:21:02,700 --> 00:21:04,620
look at this part take notes if you can

553
00:21:04,620 --> 00:21:07,440
find it Well in the end one of the team

554
00:21:07,440 --> 00:21:10,260
members said I think I found the

555
00:21:10,260 --> 00:21:12,600
location and then everybody got excited

556
00:21:12,600 --> 00:21:14,580
again after hours and hours of looking

557
00:21:14,580 --> 00:21:17,640
and we then we need to validate we need

558
00:21:17,640 --> 00:21:20,760
to be sure so we find those buildings we

559
00:21:20,760 --> 00:21:22,620
see the wall we have the fork in the

560
00:21:22,620 --> 00:21:25,880
road but if we zoom in a little bit more

561
00:21:25,880 --> 00:21:27,960
we need to find a little bit more

562
00:21:27,960 --> 00:21:30,000
because we also want to know exactly

563
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:32,880
when so if we find that camera position

564
00:21:32,880 --> 00:21:36,179
that we found in the original footage we

565
00:21:36,179 --> 00:21:38,220
can line that up with what we see on

566
00:21:38,220 --> 00:21:41,039
Google Earth so we can actually do an

567
00:21:41,039 --> 00:21:43,020
overlay and we we can see those bushes

568
00:21:43,020 --> 00:21:45,480
and we can see all kinds of details that

569
00:21:45,480 --> 00:21:47,640
match one-on-one with the location from

570
00:21:47,640 --> 00:21:48,720
the footage

571
00:21:48,720 --> 00:21:51,299
it gets even more interesting because

572
00:21:51,299 --> 00:21:53,100
when we looked at the satellite imagery

573
00:21:53,100 --> 00:21:55,559
we could even see the blood stains in

574
00:21:55,559 --> 00:21:56,760
the ground

575
00:21:56,760 --> 00:21:58,679
from the execution

576
00:21:58,679 --> 00:22:00,720
so with that the international crime

577
00:22:00,720 --> 00:22:02,460
Court had some people going over there

578
00:22:02,460 --> 00:22:04,440
on the ground and take ground samples to

579
00:22:04,440 --> 00:22:06,360
make sure if there was actually blood

580
00:22:06,360 --> 00:22:10,260
and yes the blood was there so with that

581
00:22:10,260 --> 00:22:13,320
we were let's say confident enough that

582
00:22:13,320 --> 00:22:15,360
this must have been the location now the

583
00:22:15,360 --> 00:22:18,659
next task was when when exactly did this

584
00:22:18,659 --> 00:22:21,000
happen when was the most likely time

585
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:23,640
when this event happened and the Sun is

586
00:22:23,640 --> 00:22:25,740
basically the oldest clock that we have

587
00:22:25,740 --> 00:22:29,039
so with some Shadow casts and some

588
00:22:29,039 --> 00:22:31,679
calculations and a specific tool called

589
00:22:31,679 --> 00:22:33,360
Sun calc which again is nothing more

590
00:22:33,360 --> 00:22:35,760
than a free website online we could

591
00:22:35,760 --> 00:22:38,400
calculate when this happened so we line

592
00:22:38,400 --> 00:22:41,100
it up so we determine the time and if

593
00:22:41,100 --> 00:22:42,900
you line it up we could say that this

594
00:22:42,900 --> 00:22:45,720
event happened roughly around 17 July

595
00:22:45,720 --> 00:22:51,240
around 6 47 UTC now if we do that we

596
00:22:51,240 --> 00:22:52,740
could also see based upon satellite

597
00:22:52,740 --> 00:22:54,960
imagery when the blood stains were not

598
00:22:54,960 --> 00:22:56,460
there and when they were not there so

599
00:22:56,460 --> 00:22:58,440
with that we could say well we find a

600
00:22:58,440 --> 00:23:00,480
time time frame where we say it's

601
00:23:00,480 --> 00:23:02,460
confident that this time frame this

602
00:23:02,460 --> 00:23:05,520
happened so I think this is a a perfect

603
00:23:05,520 --> 00:23:08,220
example on if you have a group that's

604
00:23:08,220 --> 00:23:11,340
persistent enough that has enough a lot

605
00:23:11,340 --> 00:23:13,679
of tenacity and a laptop and an internet

606
00:23:13,679 --> 00:23:16,380
connection and you can solve these cases

607
00:23:16,380 --> 00:23:18,840
there were no pay tools involved here

608
00:23:18,840 --> 00:23:20,880
there was no specialized software

609
00:23:20,880 --> 00:23:22,980
involved here it's basically critical

610
00:23:22,980 --> 00:23:25,440
thinking and a lot of time where you

611
00:23:25,440 --> 00:23:28,020
need to solve the puzzle so this I think

612
00:23:28,020 --> 00:23:30,059
is one of the best stories that I could

613
00:23:30,059 --> 00:23:31,980
tell that shows the power of Open Source

614
00:23:31,980 --> 00:23:34,200
intelligence when it comes to

615
00:23:34,200 --> 00:23:36,600
um yeah holding people accountable for

616
00:23:36,600 --> 00:23:38,460
their wrongdoings

617
00:23:38,460 --> 00:23:41,340
now when we look at the present I need

618
00:23:41,340 --> 00:23:43,559
automation I cannot do that heavy

619
00:23:43,559 --> 00:23:45,960
lifting myself anymore I'm getting older

620
00:23:45,960 --> 00:23:47,460
I'm getting sick and tired of doing

621
00:23:47,460 --> 00:23:49,620
everything automatically so we need

622
00:23:49,620 --> 00:23:52,080
certain tools and certain capabilities

623
00:23:52,080 --> 00:23:54,480
that can scale up what we do because

624
00:23:54,480 --> 00:23:56,700
when we look at the evening clock riots

625
00:23:56,700 --> 00:23:59,220
during the pandemic we haven't Rotterdam

626
00:23:59,220 --> 00:24:00,659
in the Netherlands we had some very

627
00:24:00,659 --> 00:24:03,480
pretty disturbing evening clock riots so

628
00:24:03,480 --> 00:24:05,280
you could only imagine that for example

629
00:24:05,280 --> 00:24:07,380
Law Enforcement wants to analyze that

630
00:24:07,380 --> 00:24:09,539
footage to make sure that the right

631
00:24:09,539 --> 00:24:12,240
wrongdoers are being caught but if you

632
00:24:12,240 --> 00:24:14,820
now need to analyze let's say four or

633
00:24:14,820 --> 00:24:17,220
five hours of footage it means that you

634
00:24:17,220 --> 00:24:19,980
will spend months analyzing that footage

635
00:24:19,980 --> 00:24:23,100
but luckily there are techniques out

636
00:24:23,100 --> 00:24:24,600
there artificial intelligence and

637
00:24:24,600 --> 00:24:25,980
machine learning that you could

638
00:24:25,980 --> 00:24:28,380
basically generate an overlay over that

639
00:24:28,380 --> 00:24:31,020
footage that will help you speed up your

640
00:24:31,020 --> 00:24:32,880
analysis process and it's a little

641
00:24:32,880 --> 00:24:34,440
spoiler for tomorrow because there's a

642
00:24:34,440 --> 00:24:36,240
little workshop that I'm giving that

643
00:24:36,240 --> 00:24:38,520
will walk you through how you could

644
00:24:38,520 --> 00:24:41,159
scale that up now here's a little

645
00:24:41,159 --> 00:24:42,840
example of that what I will show you

646
00:24:42,840 --> 00:24:44,880
tomorrow so there are some tools out

647
00:24:44,880 --> 00:24:47,159
there from which you can use an API for

648
00:24:47,159 --> 00:24:49,860
example the Google Cloud Vision API that

649
00:24:49,860 --> 00:24:52,559
will allow you for free to analyze

650
00:24:52,559 --> 00:24:54,900
footage at scale and it will show you

651
00:24:54,900 --> 00:24:57,480
when persons appear in a frame when

652
00:24:57,480 --> 00:24:59,760
certain brands run certain logos it will

653
00:24:59,760 --> 00:25:02,039
translate text in real time in any

654
00:25:02,039 --> 00:25:05,820
language it will show you a foul

655
00:25:05,820 --> 00:25:07,860
language it will show you all kinds of

656
00:25:07,860 --> 00:25:09,600
interesting pieces of information and

657
00:25:09,600 --> 00:25:11,280
you can only imagine if you need to do

658
00:25:11,280 --> 00:25:13,980
this all by hand you would spend hours

659
00:25:13,980 --> 00:25:16,260
and hours if not weeks finding that

660
00:25:16,260 --> 00:25:19,260
information and this simply speeds up my

661
00:25:19,260 --> 00:25:21,360
process now I can spend more time

662
00:25:21,360 --> 00:25:24,000
looking at hey I'm looking for that red

663
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:26,340
car show me in these three hours worth

664
00:25:26,340 --> 00:25:28,200
of footage where this red car appears

665
00:25:28,200 --> 00:25:30,539
instead of going frame by frame through

666
00:25:30,539 --> 00:25:32,279
that footage

667
00:25:32,279 --> 00:25:34,799
now when we look at the present

668
00:25:34,799 --> 00:25:37,320
criminals are begin becoming more and

669
00:25:37,320 --> 00:25:39,900
more aware of what we are doing here I

670
00:25:39,900 --> 00:25:41,760
have an example of a telegram group

671
00:25:41,760 --> 00:25:44,520
where a bunch of far right-wing Nazis

672
00:25:44,520 --> 00:25:48,360
are telling other right-wing Nazis how

673
00:25:48,360 --> 00:25:50,700
they could give me a hard time so

674
00:25:50,700 --> 00:25:51,779
they're basically telling many

675
00:25:51,779 --> 00:25:54,779
organizations nowadays have open source

676
00:25:54,779 --> 00:25:57,120
intelligence analyst in place and what

677
00:25:57,120 --> 00:25:58,559
they are basically saying here is is

678
00:25:58,559 --> 00:26:01,679
that if they flood you with enough this

679
00:26:01,679 --> 00:26:04,020
information or fake news they can keep

680
00:26:04,020 --> 00:26:07,080
me occupied for months and I see this

681
00:26:07,080 --> 00:26:09,120
happening and particularly since chat

682
00:26:09,120 --> 00:26:12,179
GTP I hate to say it TTP but it's

683
00:26:12,179 --> 00:26:15,480
everywhere I see a super increase in

684
00:26:15,480 --> 00:26:17,880
this information that is heavily being

685
00:26:17,880 --> 00:26:20,340
abused to spread let's say a false

686
00:26:20,340 --> 00:26:23,460
Narrative of any subject matter now I'm

687
00:26:23,460 --> 00:26:24,960
hoping of course I'm seeing some

688
00:26:24,960 --> 00:26:27,600
companies that are building chat GTP

689
00:26:27,600 --> 00:26:30,000
detection software that that will help

690
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:31,799
me in the near future because it's a

691
00:26:31,799 --> 00:26:33,840
it's a con and rat race when it comes to

692
00:26:33,840 --> 00:26:35,279
these Technologies

693
00:26:35,279 --> 00:26:36,900
now another thing that I need to deal

694
00:26:36,900 --> 00:26:40,020
with is deep fake or manipulated videos

695
00:26:40,020 --> 00:26:42,480
so here we see a small boy walking

696
00:26:42,480 --> 00:26:44,279
against a fence in a rig and there's a

697
00:26:44,279 --> 00:26:46,799
waterfall what oh I'm hoping he won't

698
00:26:46,799 --> 00:26:48,960
fall down because that will be let's say

699
00:26:48,960 --> 00:26:51,059
his last day of breathing

700
00:26:51,059 --> 00:26:54,000
and this looks super real

701
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:56,760
but this can be done on a smartphone a

702
00:26:56,760 --> 00:26:59,220
cheap smartphone you simply download an

703
00:26:59,220 --> 00:27:01,020
app you add a little bit of a green

704
00:27:01,020 --> 00:27:03,600
screen and you can manipulate this to

705
00:27:03,600 --> 00:27:06,179
look like something else and it's super

706
00:27:06,179 --> 00:27:09,000
hard to show if this is manipulated

707
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:11,340
you will need more sophisticated

708
00:27:11,340 --> 00:27:13,500
software that could do maybe counting of

709
00:27:13,500 --> 00:27:16,799
pixel levels and depth to to show you

710
00:27:16,799 --> 00:27:18,480
that there may be something wrong with

711
00:27:18,480 --> 00:27:20,580
this footage so that's these are the

712
00:27:20,580 --> 00:27:22,860
challenges that I need to deal with now

713
00:27:22,860 --> 00:27:24,840
and you can only imagine that this is

714
00:27:24,840 --> 00:27:27,240
just starting this deep fake technology

715
00:27:27,240 --> 00:27:30,120
10 years from now we won't be able to

716
00:27:30,120 --> 00:27:32,159
tell what's wrong or what's not wrong or

717
00:27:32,159 --> 00:27:34,020
what's manipulated or not

718
00:27:34,020 --> 00:27:35,820
I'm hoping that we will still be capable

719
00:27:35,820 --> 00:27:37,860
but I anticipate that that will become

720
00:27:37,860 --> 00:27:40,500
increasingly challenging now another

721
00:27:40,500 --> 00:27:43,980
thing making a deep fake super easy you

722
00:27:43,980 --> 00:27:45,480
download the smartphone app again I

723
00:27:45,480 --> 00:27:46,799
think some of you are familiar with

724
00:27:46,799 --> 00:27:49,500
Snapchat or Instagram filters and you

725
00:27:49,500 --> 00:27:51,179
can make someone appear to be someone

726
00:27:51,179 --> 00:27:54,779
else I use this also myself because I

727
00:27:54,779 --> 00:27:57,179
need fake accounts fake personas online

728
00:27:57,179 --> 00:28:00,000
to move around because well you can only

729
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:01,440
imagine if you're trying to trace down

730
00:28:01,440 --> 00:28:04,140
FSB or Gru agents that you don't want to

731
00:28:04,140 --> 00:28:06,240
do that on your own name so you need to

732
00:28:06,240 --> 00:28:09,480
create a false persona so with that we

733
00:28:09,480 --> 00:28:11,220
can use these techniques but I also

734
00:28:11,220 --> 00:28:13,440
perform they perform a big challenge for

735
00:28:13,440 --> 00:28:16,559
me to to at least try and prove if Mandy

736
00:28:16,559 --> 00:28:18,840
is actually Mandy or not

737
00:28:18,840 --> 00:28:23,059
so we need to deal with this

738
00:28:25,679 --> 00:28:27,419
president

739
00:28:27,419 --> 00:28:28,980
so here we have

740
00:28:28,980 --> 00:28:31,200
solenski well and this is a really

741
00:28:31,200 --> 00:28:33,659
crappy deep fake because we can see that

742
00:28:33,659 --> 00:28:35,880
his body is not moving

743
00:28:35,880 --> 00:28:37,919
um it's only his hat moving the blinking

744
00:28:37,919 --> 00:28:39,360
is really awesome when you look at the

745
00:28:39,360 --> 00:28:40,860
eyeshadow those are still those little

746
00:28:40,860 --> 00:28:43,380
Tails but what if I told you that this

747
00:28:43,380 --> 00:28:46,559
video went viral in 15 minutes and

748
00:28:46,559 --> 00:28:50,100
reached 17 million people in Five in 15

749
00:28:50,100 --> 00:28:52,500
minutes and there were actually a couple

750
00:28:52,500 --> 00:28:54,900
of thousand people in Ukraine who laid

751
00:28:54,900 --> 00:28:56,640
down their arms because he's basically

752
00:28:56,640 --> 00:28:58,980
calling to the Ukrainian people say hey

753
00:28:58,980 --> 00:29:01,200
lay down your arms surrender and people

754
00:29:01,200 --> 00:29:03,120
he actually did that based upon this

755
00:29:03,120 --> 00:29:06,299
with a video that certain groups made to

756
00:29:06,299 --> 00:29:08,400
go viral on numerous social media

757
00:29:08,400 --> 00:29:09,720
platforms

758
00:29:09,720 --> 00:29:11,880
so with that it's not only for me always

759
00:29:11,880 --> 00:29:13,679
trying to prove hey there's a deep fake

760
00:29:13,679 --> 00:29:16,500
but also sometimes I need to stop videos

761
00:29:16,500 --> 00:29:18,480
from spreading as soon as possible

762
00:29:18,480 --> 00:29:20,580
because things can go sideways really

763
00:29:20,580 --> 00:29:21,480
fast

764
00:29:21,480 --> 00:29:24,120
just showing you that it doesn't have to

765
00:29:24,120 --> 00:29:27,299
be Advanced now with stylegan

766
00:29:27,299 --> 00:29:30,059
um you can make basically make anything

767
00:29:30,059 --> 00:29:32,760
here I'm asking to to generate a bald

768
00:29:32,760 --> 00:29:34,799
guy with a hoodie and glasses I was

769
00:29:34,799 --> 00:29:36,539
trying to get let's say a false persona

770
00:29:36,539 --> 00:29:38,340
for myself

771
00:29:38,340 --> 00:29:40,799
I use these faces because social media

772
00:29:40,799 --> 00:29:43,200
accounts need a profile picture and I'm

773
00:29:43,200 --> 00:29:45,000
not going to use your picture because

774
00:29:45,000 --> 00:29:47,100
first of all that would may get you into

775
00:29:47,100 --> 00:29:49,440
into trouble and also gdpr that could be

776
00:29:49,440 --> 00:29:51,600
a little bit sketchy so I use these as

777
00:29:51,600 --> 00:29:52,860
well myself

778
00:29:52,860 --> 00:29:55,140
but it also again poses a challenge for

779
00:29:55,140 --> 00:29:56,640
open source intelligence investigators

780
00:29:56,640 --> 00:29:58,980
how do I know that the profile that I'm

781
00:29:58,980 --> 00:30:01,500
viewing is actually a person or is it

782
00:30:01,500 --> 00:30:03,299
being puppeteered by someone

783
00:30:03,299 --> 00:30:05,820
now when you look at this concept you

784
00:30:05,820 --> 00:30:07,440
can also flip this a little bit around

785
00:30:07,440 --> 00:30:10,080
you can also use this again to spread

786
00:30:10,080 --> 00:30:12,240
this information so I started to explore

787
00:30:12,240 --> 00:30:14,640
this a little bit and the next example

788
00:30:14,640 --> 00:30:17,399
I'm basically asking this style Gan

789
00:30:17,399 --> 00:30:19,799
daily kind of Technologies hey hey show

790
00:30:19,799 --> 00:30:22,500
me a picture of a war aftermath show me

791
00:30:22,500 --> 00:30:24,360
satellite imagery of a warm aftermath

792
00:30:24,360 --> 00:30:26,820
and again it creates this out of thin

793
00:30:26,820 --> 00:30:29,159
air based upon a computer algorithm but

794
00:30:29,159 --> 00:30:30,360
we get now

795
00:30:30,360 --> 00:30:32,820
satellite imagery that looks awfully

796
00:30:32,820 --> 00:30:33,659
real

797
00:30:33,659 --> 00:30:35,580
that I could spread on social media

798
00:30:35,580 --> 00:30:37,440
saying hey the ukrainians or the

799
00:30:37,440 --> 00:30:39,179
Russians did a lot did a bombing again

800
00:30:39,179 --> 00:30:42,720
and people like me may spend hours and

801
00:30:42,720 --> 00:30:45,059
hours investigating a satellite image

802
00:30:45,059 --> 00:30:46,740
that has never existed and will never

803
00:30:46,740 --> 00:30:48,000
exist

804
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:50,580
but again people use this I see this

805
00:30:50,580 --> 00:30:52,320
happening more and more particularly in

806
00:30:52,320 --> 00:30:54,720
the last half year this technology is

807
00:30:54,720 --> 00:30:57,179
heavily being abused within certain

808
00:30:57,179 --> 00:30:59,159
groups to spread this information and

809
00:30:59,159 --> 00:31:01,679
fake news so again it's wonderful

810
00:31:01,679 --> 00:31:04,020
technology but it will definitely be

811
00:31:04,020 --> 00:31:07,380
abused for wrongdoings

812
00:31:07,380 --> 00:31:10,320
now when we look at this scalability I

813
00:31:10,320 --> 00:31:12,240
need to graph out certain pieces of

814
00:31:12,240 --> 00:31:14,220
information so a graph is nothing more

815
00:31:14,220 --> 00:31:16,799
than a data structure that contains

816
00:31:16,799 --> 00:31:19,080
entities so entities could be all of you

817
00:31:19,080 --> 00:31:21,600
and nodes so we have a connection so in

818
00:31:21,600 --> 00:31:24,179
this case I could be the speaker and the

819
00:31:24,179 --> 00:31:25,740
connection that we have is to do our

820
00:31:25,740 --> 00:31:27,360
listeners and we now are connected

821
00:31:27,360 --> 00:31:30,299
together in a graph in a picture so for

822
00:31:30,299 --> 00:31:32,340
network analysis I need to do this

823
00:31:32,340 --> 00:31:34,080
because I want to map out certain

824
00:31:34,080 --> 00:31:36,539
connections and see who knows who who

825
00:31:36,539 --> 00:31:38,820
has certain access to certain data or

826
00:31:38,820 --> 00:31:40,320
whatever it really depends on what I

827
00:31:40,320 --> 00:31:41,580
want to find out

828
00:31:41,580 --> 00:31:44,520
so with that you can use a lot of tools

829
00:31:44,520 --> 00:31:47,159
that will help you connect the dots and

830
00:31:47,159 --> 00:31:49,020
this is where I'm getting it in the

831
00:31:49,020 --> 00:31:50,880
present and in the future we need to

832
00:31:50,880 --> 00:31:54,179
scale up so in the good old days when we

833
00:31:54,179 --> 00:31:56,520
had hives I could do this manually I

834
00:31:56,520 --> 00:31:58,740
could find someone's profile maybe that

835
00:31:58,740 --> 00:32:01,380
hacker that was doing kind of let's say

836
00:32:01,380 --> 00:32:03,419
illegal stuff that need to need to be

837
00:32:03,419 --> 00:32:05,159
mapped out or I could find let's say

838
00:32:05,159 --> 00:32:08,340
that cocaine cartel criminal or maybe

839
00:32:08,340 --> 00:32:10,440
some other criminals I could do that

840
00:32:10,440 --> 00:32:12,960
manually but now if people having so

841
00:32:12,960 --> 00:32:14,820
much connections on numerous social

842
00:32:14,820 --> 00:32:16,679
media platforms it's nearly impossible

843
00:32:16,679 --> 00:32:18,779
for me to do this manually so you need

844
00:32:18,779 --> 00:32:21,360
scalable tools that are capable of

845
00:32:21,360 --> 00:32:23,880
automatically collecting data at scale

846
00:32:23,880 --> 00:32:26,640
from open sources so the data is already

847
00:32:26,640 --> 00:32:28,620
out there but these tools make it

848
00:32:28,620 --> 00:32:30,960
possible for me to collect the data and

849
00:32:30,960 --> 00:32:33,240
spend more time on the actual analysis

850
00:32:33,240 --> 00:32:36,179
to answer that intelligence requirement

851
00:32:36,179 --> 00:32:38,100
so when we look at that

852
00:32:38,100 --> 00:32:40,020
um one of these things that helped me is

853
00:32:40,020 --> 00:32:42,960
that there was an anonymous tip that um

854
00:32:42,960 --> 00:32:45,840
someone said through

855
00:32:45,840 --> 00:32:48,419
um missed that underneath shall calling

856
00:32:48,419 --> 00:32:50,220
crime anonymously

857
00:32:50,220 --> 00:32:53,220
um hey we have a link to a streaming

858
00:32:53,220 --> 00:32:55,860
video account kind of like twitch where

859
00:32:55,860 --> 00:32:58,740
someone is making a statement that he is

860
00:32:58,740 --> 00:33:00,659
planning a school shooting in the

861
00:33:00,659 --> 00:33:02,700
Netherlands now there were a lot of

862
00:33:02,700 --> 00:33:04,440
smart investigators looking at this but

863
00:33:04,440 --> 00:33:06,600
they got stuck on the dead ends in the

864
00:33:06,600 --> 00:33:08,340
end it was all about persistence or at

865
00:33:08,340 --> 00:33:10,740
least that that's my humble opinion so

866
00:33:10,740 --> 00:33:13,140
they reached out to me and said hey Nico

867
00:33:13,140 --> 00:33:14,460
can you help you know a little bit about

868
00:33:14,460 --> 00:33:16,200
open source intelligence can you help us

869
00:33:16,200 --> 00:33:18,720
find the guy who was claiming to plan a

870
00:33:18,720 --> 00:33:21,000
school shooting so I'm saying well send

871
00:33:21,000 --> 00:33:22,500
me the information that you have and

872
00:33:22,500 --> 00:33:23,820
they sent me the link through the

873
00:33:23,820 --> 00:33:25,919
streaming Channel and on that streaming

874
00:33:25,919 --> 00:33:28,740
Channel there was a guy what we call in

875
00:33:28,740 --> 00:33:32,100
our world a typical incel so someone who

876
00:33:32,100 --> 00:33:33,600
never leaves his room I think there are

877
00:33:33,600 --> 00:33:36,120
some in cells here like myself I also

878
00:33:36,120 --> 00:33:38,279
tend not to like my my little hacking

879
00:33:38,279 --> 00:33:42,480
room but this guy was almost I think

880
00:33:42,480 --> 00:33:44,460
it's safe to say almost 14 hours per day

881
00:33:44,460 --> 00:33:46,500
live streaming sometimes he was just

882
00:33:46,500 --> 00:33:48,000
sitting behind his computer doing

883
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:49,919
nothing you could just see him sit there

884
00:33:49,919 --> 00:33:51,480
sitting

885
00:33:51,480 --> 00:33:53,640
but in one of those videos he made a

886
00:33:53,640 --> 00:33:54,899
statement that he was planning a school

887
00:33:54,899 --> 00:33:57,659
shooting so I needed to go over all that

888
00:33:57,659 --> 00:33:59,700
footage and see if I could find the

889
00:33:59,700 --> 00:34:02,100
information at that moment I was not

890
00:34:02,100 --> 00:34:03,960
aware of the techniques that I will

891
00:34:03,960 --> 00:34:05,399
discussed tomorrow in the workshop so

892
00:34:05,399 --> 00:34:07,740
this was manual work so I watched I

893
00:34:07,740 --> 00:34:09,480
think almost 24 hours worth of video

894
00:34:09,480 --> 00:34:12,899
units until I found a statement that

895
00:34:12,899 --> 00:34:15,780
confirmed yes he literally sat on Mike

896
00:34:15,780 --> 00:34:18,199
on camera I'm planning a school shooting

897
00:34:18,199 --> 00:34:21,060
somewhere close to where I live that was

898
00:34:21,060 --> 00:34:23,040
there was a little statement just to

899
00:34:23,040 --> 00:34:24,300
give you an impression impression of

900
00:34:24,300 --> 00:34:27,619
what I had to look at

901
00:34:29,099 --> 00:34:30,480
shake it

902
00:34:30,480 --> 00:34:34,159
this is moving footage by the way

903
00:34:38,219 --> 00:34:41,959
you just need to be more careful

904
00:34:42,179 --> 00:34:44,720
yeah

905
00:34:44,760 --> 00:34:48,800
especially in regards to like

906
00:34:51,179 --> 00:34:53,580
drinking outside I need to keep it

907
00:34:53,580 --> 00:34:56,540
low-key for a while

908
00:34:57,900 --> 00:35:00,540
you get the idea this was hours and

909
00:35:00,540 --> 00:35:02,640
hours of footage and here is basically

910
00:35:02,640 --> 00:35:04,560
saying hey I need to stay low-key I need

911
00:35:04,560 --> 00:35:06,240
to stay under the radar I think people

912
00:35:06,240 --> 00:35:08,040
are on to me

913
00:35:08,040 --> 00:35:08,820
um

914
00:35:08,820 --> 00:35:10,800
so I looked at the footage I found

915
00:35:10,800 --> 00:35:12,599
evidence yes he made that statement but

916
00:35:12,599 --> 00:35:14,520
still I did not know who he was we

917
00:35:14,520 --> 00:35:16,500
wanted to know where he could be found

918
00:35:16,500 --> 00:35:18,180
because well I think if someone's

919
00:35:18,180 --> 00:35:20,579
claiming to plan a school shooting you

920
00:35:20,579 --> 00:35:22,140
may want to at least knock on that door

921
00:35:22,140 --> 00:35:23,640
and say hey is everything okay with you

922
00:35:23,640 --> 00:35:26,040
should we should we talk or something

923
00:35:26,040 --> 00:35:28,079
so I watched all that footage over and

924
00:35:28,079 --> 00:35:30,300
over again and interestingly I found

925
00:35:30,300 --> 00:35:32,040
some at least some proof that this was a

926
00:35:32,040 --> 00:35:33,960
guy that was most likely in the

927
00:35:33,960 --> 00:35:35,520
Netherlands or spent time in the

928
00:35:35,520 --> 00:35:37,800
Netherlands so I found a Dutch bank

929
00:35:37,800 --> 00:35:40,619
account pass so a debit card so that at

930
00:35:40,619 --> 00:35:43,140
least could say well this might be a guy

931
00:35:43,140 --> 00:35:44,700
that lives in the nails I'm still not

932
00:35:44,700 --> 00:35:48,060
sure and I found a location of a Albert

933
00:35:48,060 --> 00:35:50,220
Hein in Amsterdam so this is literally

934
00:35:50,220 --> 00:35:51,900
if you have this picture and you reverse

935
00:35:51,900 --> 00:35:53,820
images that picture it will tell you

936
00:35:53,820 --> 00:35:55,380
immediately Google will tell you hey

937
00:35:55,380 --> 00:35:58,320
this is the albertine in Amsterdam so

938
00:35:58,320 --> 00:36:00,359
with that I found again a little bit

939
00:36:00,359 --> 00:36:01,980
more confirmation that made me a little

940
00:36:01,980 --> 00:36:03,839
bit more confident yes this guy is most

941
00:36:03,839 --> 00:36:06,480
likely in or around the Netherlands and

942
00:36:06,480 --> 00:36:09,240
he had maybe living there but still not

943
00:36:09,240 --> 00:36:10,200
enough

944
00:36:10,200 --> 00:36:12,780
so I watched the footage the footage and

945
00:36:12,780 --> 00:36:16,079
in the blink of an eye this guy hovered

946
00:36:16,079 --> 00:36:18,480
over his account in his Google browser

947
00:36:18,480 --> 00:36:21,240
and with that it exposed two email

948
00:36:21,240 --> 00:36:25,500
addresses and I was like yes finally I

949
00:36:25,500 --> 00:36:27,060
don't do not need to watch this guy

950
00:36:27,060 --> 00:36:29,579
anymore so with that

951
00:36:29,579 --> 00:36:33,300
I found two usernames and two email

952
00:36:33,300 --> 00:36:35,220
addresses and I will tell you if you

953
00:36:35,220 --> 00:36:37,140
give me an email address or a username

954
00:36:37,140 --> 00:36:39,599
the likelihood of me finding something

955
00:36:39,599 --> 00:36:42,780
about you is pretty high so with that I

956
00:36:42,780 --> 00:36:44,400
use some in this case some automated

957
00:36:44,400 --> 00:36:47,160
Tools in multigo to pop in that email

958
00:36:47,160 --> 00:36:50,460
address and say hey can you show me what

959
00:36:50,460 --> 00:36:53,520
social media accounts are used to set up

960
00:36:53,520 --> 00:36:55,560
this account and it told me hey I found

961
00:36:55,560 --> 00:36:57,480
numerous with that I was capable of

962
00:36:57,480 --> 00:36:59,820
founding finding a Facebook page that

963
00:36:59,820 --> 00:37:02,119
gave me his official first and last name

964
00:37:02,119 --> 00:37:04,619
also confirmation on where he lived and

965
00:37:04,619 --> 00:37:06,300
where he went to school and with that I

966
00:37:06,300 --> 00:37:08,700
had let's say enough information to hand

967
00:37:08,700 --> 00:37:10,260
over to the authorities and say well

968
00:37:10,260 --> 00:37:11,820
maybe you want to knock on this guy's

969
00:37:11,820 --> 00:37:15,119
door and with that I think it's safe to

970
00:37:15,119 --> 00:37:16,920
say that we might have prevented a

971
00:37:16,920 --> 00:37:18,240
school shooting somewhere in the

972
00:37:18,240 --> 00:37:20,220
Netherlands so I think that again shows

973
00:37:20,220 --> 00:37:22,380
a great example of how powerful open

974
00:37:22,380 --> 00:37:24,300
source intelligence in certain cases can

975
00:37:24,300 --> 00:37:26,460
be and of course that we need

976
00:37:26,460 --> 00:37:29,400
persistence tenacity but also tools that

977
00:37:29,400 --> 00:37:31,800
will will scale up and speed up my

978
00:37:31,800 --> 00:37:33,420
overall investigations and Analysis

979
00:37:33,420 --> 00:37:35,400
because if I needed to graph this out

980
00:37:35,400 --> 00:37:39,180
manually I would probably need again a

981
00:37:39,180 --> 00:37:41,160
couple of days and we were on the time

982
00:37:41,160 --> 00:37:43,079
constraint because what if he picked up

983
00:37:43,079 --> 00:37:44,940
that firearm now and went out shooting

984
00:37:44,940 --> 00:37:48,240
so there was Timeless of the essence

985
00:37:48,240 --> 00:37:50,579
now things that I need to deal with

986
00:37:50,579 --> 00:37:54,300
is nft so nfts are being used by

987
00:37:54,300 --> 00:37:56,280
terrorist groups in this case the

988
00:37:56,280 --> 00:37:59,280
Islamic State use nfts to spread let's

989
00:37:59,280 --> 00:38:01,859
say the propaganda and why do they use

990
00:38:01,859 --> 00:38:04,920
it well it's sensor resistant so you put

991
00:38:04,920 --> 00:38:06,900
up your prep propaganda and there's no

992
00:38:06,900 --> 00:38:08,520
Authority in the world that could take

993
00:38:08,520 --> 00:38:10,920
down that content and with that it gives

994
00:38:10,920 --> 00:38:13,079
them extra power to spread their message

995
00:38:13,079 --> 00:38:15,420
and spread all the horrific things that

996
00:38:15,420 --> 00:38:16,740
they want to do

997
00:38:16,740 --> 00:38:19,920
so I can still find it but again for

998
00:38:19,920 --> 00:38:22,200
your 40s to take this down this will be

999
00:38:22,200 --> 00:38:25,140
a big Challenge and I need to learn and

1000
00:38:25,140 --> 00:38:27,720
hopefully talk to people like you that

1001
00:38:27,720 --> 00:38:29,099
are way smarter when it comes to

1002
00:38:29,099 --> 00:38:31,140
cryptography and that kind of stuff to

1003
00:38:31,140 --> 00:38:34,200
tell me hey maybe Nico if you look here

1004
00:38:34,200 --> 00:38:36,839
or do that that could help people and

1005
00:38:36,839 --> 00:38:38,460
other investigators all around the world

1006
00:38:38,460 --> 00:38:40,800
to prevent let's say terrorist groups to

1007
00:38:40,800 --> 00:38:42,540
become active and do all kinds of

1008
00:38:42,540 --> 00:38:44,400
horrific stuff

1009
00:38:44,400 --> 00:38:46,920
now when we look at the future uh well

1010
00:38:46,920 --> 00:38:50,040
the future is for me impossible to to to

1011
00:38:50,040 --> 00:38:53,460
see but I can give you my perspective on

1012
00:38:53,460 --> 00:38:55,680
what I anticipate upon when it comes to

1013
00:38:55,680 --> 00:38:57,420
my profession open source intelligence

1014
00:38:57,420 --> 00:38:59,820
what should we be aware of well the

1015
00:38:59,820 --> 00:39:02,160
metaverse is coming so Virtual Worlds

1016
00:39:02,160 --> 00:39:04,560
that mean something for investigators

1017
00:39:04,560 --> 00:39:06,960
all around the world I it also gave me a

1018
00:39:06,960 --> 00:39:08,820
good excuse to tell someone hey I need

1019
00:39:08,820 --> 00:39:10,800
to order those Facebook goggles because

1020
00:39:10,800 --> 00:39:13,859
I need to also give give an excuse to

1021
00:39:13,859 --> 00:39:15,000
again

1022
00:39:15,000 --> 00:39:16,859
get a company credit card out or

1023
00:39:16,859 --> 00:39:19,040
something

1024
00:39:19,320 --> 00:39:21,599
but what if you need to show your

1025
00:39:21,599 --> 00:39:23,220
government ID to get access to the

1026
00:39:23,220 --> 00:39:25,500
metaverse how could criminals use that

1027
00:39:25,500 --> 00:39:27,780
and have used it I could how could now I

1028
00:39:27,780 --> 00:39:29,820
search there anonymously so there are

1029
00:39:29,820 --> 00:39:32,760
challenges web 3.0 is becoming more and

1030
00:39:32,760 --> 00:39:34,520
more decentralized so more

1031
00:39:34,520 --> 00:39:38,099
blockchainized it means that traces will

1032
00:39:38,099 --> 00:39:41,220
be transparent but who basically made

1033
00:39:41,220 --> 00:39:43,619
those traces will be pretty hard for me

1034
00:39:43,619 --> 00:39:46,260
to pinpoint to say Hey you are the

1035
00:39:46,260 --> 00:39:48,060
person who's responsible for posting

1036
00:39:48,060 --> 00:39:49,560
this information online because

1037
00:39:49,560 --> 00:39:51,960
everything is decentralized and also

1038
00:39:51,960 --> 00:39:54,619
encrypted pretty happily

1039
00:39:54,619 --> 00:39:56,640
artificial intelligence and machine

1040
00:39:56,640 --> 00:39:59,520
learning is also blurring my sight just

1041
00:39:59,520 --> 00:40:02,280
like chat GTP is doing I do not always

1042
00:40:02,280 --> 00:40:05,160
immediately know if this is you behind

1043
00:40:05,160 --> 00:40:07,079
the keyword or some kind of algorithm

1044
00:40:07,079 --> 00:40:09,359
but also keep in mind when we look at

1045
00:40:09,359 --> 00:40:12,119
for example what Google does is they

1046
00:40:12,119 --> 00:40:14,280
will tailor your results based upon your

1047
00:40:14,280 --> 00:40:16,200
searching Behavior particularly if you

1048
00:40:16,200 --> 00:40:18,599
are logged in into your accounts so that

1049
00:40:18,599 --> 00:40:20,820
means that they will Custom Tailor your

1050
00:40:20,820 --> 00:40:23,940
search results but if I get back custom

1051
00:40:23,940 --> 00:40:26,339
tailored search results it means that I

1052
00:40:26,339 --> 00:40:28,320
could miss information that could be

1053
00:40:28,320 --> 00:40:30,780
very valuable for my investigation so I

1054
00:40:30,780 --> 00:40:33,359
need to figure out ways to blur out my

1055
00:40:33,359 --> 00:40:35,700
digital fingerprint by rotating maybe IP

1056
00:40:35,700 --> 00:40:38,400
addresses by set setting up ad blockers

1057
00:40:38,400 --> 00:40:40,440
but ad blockers by themselves will track

1058
00:40:40,440 --> 00:40:42,839
you so there are multiple ways that I

1059
00:40:42,839 --> 00:40:44,579
need to deal with to tackle the future

1060
00:40:44,579 --> 00:40:48,780
to get unfiltered information and that

1061
00:40:48,780 --> 00:40:51,480
is a huge challenge to get unfiltered

1062
00:40:51,480 --> 00:40:53,579
information in unfail to church results

1063
00:40:53,579 --> 00:40:55,560
because every search engine out there so

1064
00:40:55,560 --> 00:40:58,079
Google Bing Yandex the big ones they

1065
00:40:58,079 --> 00:40:59,640
will all give you custom tailored

1066
00:40:59,640 --> 00:41:00,960
results based upon your device

1067
00:41:00,960 --> 00:41:03,480
fingerprint and your overall Behavior

1068
00:41:03,480 --> 00:41:06,200
online and that again is a big challenge

1069
00:41:06,200 --> 00:41:08,700
we've seen more and more devices being

1070
00:41:08,700 --> 00:41:10,500
connected to the internet I've recently

1071
00:41:10,500 --> 00:41:12,960
ordered a new dishwasher and the guy who

1072
00:41:12,960 --> 00:41:14,700
installed it in my home he's like can I

1073
00:41:14,700 --> 00:41:18,359
get the Wi-Fi password I'm like why and

1074
00:41:18,359 --> 00:41:20,099
he's like yeah it's for your dishwasher

1075
00:41:20,099 --> 00:41:22,800
I'm like why does my dishwater need

1076
00:41:22,800 --> 00:41:25,200
Wi-Fi well you can turn it on and off

1077
00:41:25,200 --> 00:41:28,859
remotely why I'm not that lazy but it

1078
00:41:28,859 --> 00:41:30,720
means that again we have now a device

1079
00:41:30,720 --> 00:41:33,540
connected that could be vulnerable that

1080
00:41:33,540 --> 00:41:35,220
could be exploited but also could be

1081
00:41:35,220 --> 00:41:38,280
maybe used by me to fine maybe again

1082
00:41:38,280 --> 00:41:40,320
someone's email address or someone's

1083
00:41:40,320 --> 00:41:42,300
username because we have a user account

1084
00:41:42,300 --> 00:41:45,119
now for a dishwasher and at least behind

1085
00:41:45,119 --> 00:41:46,859
traces that could be used to find

1086
00:41:46,859 --> 00:41:48,180
something

1087
00:41:48,180 --> 00:41:50,760
so do never forget that those are things

1088
00:41:50,760 --> 00:41:52,980
that we need to deal with one thing that

1089
00:41:52,980 --> 00:41:55,140
I think will give me an advantage is

1090
00:41:55,140 --> 00:41:57,660
that we can communicate as humans so

1091
00:41:57,660 --> 00:41:59,540
virtual human intelligence

1092
00:41:59,540 --> 00:42:02,099
interpersonal interaction is really

1093
00:42:02,099 --> 00:42:04,380
valuable for me when it comes to finding

1094
00:42:04,380 --> 00:42:06,839
let's say stolen data sets or breach

1095
00:42:06,839 --> 00:42:08,700
data I sometimes want to communicate

1096
00:42:08,700 --> 00:42:10,859
with those people and say Hey where's

1097
00:42:10,859 --> 00:42:12,720
this coming from what's Happening what's

1098
00:42:12,720 --> 00:42:14,280
your interest why are you actually

1099
00:42:14,280 --> 00:42:17,640
sharing this date of reach so we need

1100
00:42:17,640 --> 00:42:20,940
that in essence the biggest issue that I

1101
00:42:20,940 --> 00:42:23,160
have is that I need to deal with data at

1102
00:42:23,160 --> 00:42:25,800
a very large scale and I need my

1103
00:42:25,800 --> 00:42:27,660
traditional trade craft techniques but I

1104
00:42:27,660 --> 00:42:30,000
also need to learn how to scale up what

1105
00:42:30,000 --> 00:42:32,460
I do and I will tell you beforehand that

1106
00:42:32,460 --> 00:42:34,320
most open source utilities investigators

1107
00:42:34,320 --> 00:42:36,420
are not programmers they are not

1108
00:42:36,420 --> 00:42:39,119
Developers for example I teach a course

1109
00:42:39,119 --> 00:42:41,460
and the most demanded feature that

1110
00:42:41,460 --> 00:42:43,320
people want to teach me is learning how

1111
00:42:43,320 --> 00:42:45,839
to program in Python because that can

1112
00:42:45,839 --> 00:42:47,820
speed up and automate certain stuff but

1113
00:42:47,820 --> 00:42:49,980
if you never touched a terminal on your

1114
00:42:49,980 --> 00:42:51,960
computer or a shell that's a challenge

1115
00:42:51,960 --> 00:42:55,560
to teach people how to program something

1116
00:42:55,560 --> 00:42:57,599
so those are things that we need to deal

1117
00:42:57,599 --> 00:42:59,819
with or maybe the open source

1118
00:42:59,819 --> 00:43:01,859
intelligence world needs to team up way

1119
00:43:01,859 --> 00:43:03,960
more with developers I like to sit down

1120
00:43:03,960 --> 00:43:05,400
with developers and just explain them

1121
00:43:05,400 --> 00:43:07,800
hey this is my problem you know how to

1122
00:43:07,800 --> 00:43:09,960
code I know some fundamental principles

1123
00:43:09,960 --> 00:43:12,540
of coding but can you help me out can

1124
00:43:12,540 --> 00:43:13,859
you give me a different angle or

1125
00:43:13,859 --> 00:43:15,720
perspective can you maybe whip up some

1126
00:43:15,720 --> 00:43:18,420
code to show a proof of concept those

1127
00:43:18,420 --> 00:43:20,339
kind of things that's what we need

1128
00:43:20,339 --> 00:43:23,640
now when we look at web 3.0

1129
00:43:23,640 --> 00:43:26,940
um we are becoming more and more

1130
00:43:26,940 --> 00:43:27,480
um

1131
00:43:27,480 --> 00:43:30,300
entangled in the augmented world where

1132
00:43:30,300 --> 00:43:32,220
the mix between reality Universal

1133
00:43:32,220 --> 00:43:35,819
reality becomes Blended and with that

1134
00:43:35,819 --> 00:43:37,859
um again I think it will become

1135
00:43:37,859 --> 00:43:39,900
increasingly more challenging for us to

1136
00:43:39,900 --> 00:43:42,119
stay Anonymous in what we do but also it

1137
00:43:42,119 --> 00:43:44,220
become will become way more challenging

1138
00:43:44,220 --> 00:43:47,579
for me to find criminals online

1139
00:43:47,579 --> 00:43:50,099
um now the other thing is when we look

1140
00:43:50,099 --> 00:43:52,560
at the near future I also think that all

1141
00:43:52,560 --> 00:43:54,119
the things that are now giving me

1142
00:43:54,119 --> 00:43:57,420
trouble can help me

1143
00:43:57,420 --> 00:43:59,339
um become better and more efficient in

1144
00:43:59,339 --> 00:44:01,800
what I do so when I talk about goal and

1145
00:44:01,800 --> 00:44:04,680
scoping talking to my client I can use

1146
00:44:04,680 --> 00:44:06,599
those machine learning lessons learned

1147
00:44:06,599 --> 00:44:10,859
and integrate them into new cases so I

1148
00:44:10,859 --> 00:44:13,859
can use those algorithms to help me make

1149
00:44:13,859 --> 00:44:16,020
find early warnings or get other things

1150
00:44:16,020 --> 00:44:19,440
it can help me automatically gather data

1151
00:44:19,440 --> 00:44:21,420
that is within the scope of my

1152
00:44:21,420 --> 00:44:23,819
investigation I can get

1153
00:44:23,819 --> 00:44:26,280
um automatic monitoring or alerting for

1154
00:44:26,280 --> 00:44:27,900
certain keywords or certain things so

1155
00:44:27,900 --> 00:44:29,940
think again if someone is planning a

1156
00:44:29,940 --> 00:44:32,160
terrorist attack and they may be using

1157
00:44:32,160 --> 00:44:34,500
certain words or keywords I want to

1158
00:44:34,500 --> 00:44:36,359
monitor for those keywords to get that

1159
00:44:36,359 --> 00:44:39,839
early warning on also processing of data

1160
00:44:39,839 --> 00:44:41,880
large scale I can use now object

1161
00:44:41,880 --> 00:44:43,980
recognition facial recognition natural

1162
00:44:43,980 --> 00:44:46,980
long language processing to again scale

1163
00:44:46,980 --> 00:44:49,560
up my processes and efforts and with

1164
00:44:49,560 --> 00:44:52,020
that the analysis the pattern matching

1165
00:44:52,020 --> 00:44:53,819
and the trend detection of visualization

1166
00:44:53,819 --> 00:44:56,460
will help me be more efficient in what I

1167
00:44:56,460 --> 00:44:58,980
need to do I simply will have more time

1168
00:44:58,980 --> 00:45:02,040
to do the factual analysis the int part

1169
00:45:02,040 --> 00:45:04,380
within open source intelligence so with

1170
00:45:04,380 --> 00:45:06,900
that I think all these techniques that

1171
00:45:06,900 --> 00:45:09,000
are forming hurdles within my

1172
00:45:09,000 --> 00:45:10,800
investigation will in the near future

1173
00:45:10,800 --> 00:45:13,680
also be capable to help me

1174
00:45:13,680 --> 00:45:16,680
now when we look at the near future web

1175
00:45:16,680 --> 00:45:18,660
free.0 challenge for open source

1176
00:45:18,660 --> 00:45:21,420
intelligence uh decentralized stuff will

1177
00:45:21,420 --> 00:45:23,040
become increasing challenging the

1178
00:45:23,040 --> 00:45:25,260
semantic web smarter web so computers

1179
00:45:25,260 --> 00:45:26,400
that will

1180
00:45:26,400 --> 00:45:28,740
think for themselves

1181
00:45:28,740 --> 00:45:30,480
um will become a problem blockchain

1182
00:45:30,480 --> 00:45:31,859
technology

1183
00:45:31,859 --> 00:45:34,560
um great technology but not always good

1184
00:45:34,560 --> 00:45:37,280
for finding something or someone

1185
00:45:37,280 --> 00:45:40,319
and of course evolved Ai and machine

1186
00:45:40,319 --> 00:45:42,900
learning will perform and maybe even

1187
00:45:42,900 --> 00:45:44,940
bigger challenge but we're already in

1188
00:45:44,940 --> 00:45:46,380
this state because when we look at this

1189
00:45:46,380 --> 00:45:48,240
we are already living in an Internet

1190
00:45:48,240 --> 00:45:51,480
connected world where every device seems

1191
00:45:51,480 --> 00:45:52,920
to have a connection to the internet

1192
00:45:52,920 --> 00:45:54,839
just like my dishwasher cameras

1193
00:45:54,839 --> 00:45:57,839
Bluetooth everywhere so with that it

1194
00:45:57,839 --> 00:45:59,520
gives me also those eyes and ears

1195
00:45:59,520 --> 00:46:01,680
there's a lot of opportunity now going

1196
00:46:01,680 --> 00:46:03,240
back a little bit about open source

1197
00:46:03,240 --> 00:46:04,800
intelligence and virtual human

1198
00:46:04,800 --> 00:46:07,260
intelligence I think that the human

1199
00:46:07,260 --> 00:46:09,180
intelligence World which is basically

1200
00:46:09,180 --> 00:46:12,000
tradition traditional spy trade craft

1201
00:46:12,000 --> 00:46:14,339
mostly where they talk to someone in

1202
00:46:14,339 --> 00:46:16,380
exchange for information or they are

1203
00:46:16,380 --> 00:46:18,240
willing to share some information well

1204
00:46:18,240 --> 00:46:19,859
we can move that to the digital world

1205
00:46:19,859 --> 00:46:23,220
and we can use that to maybe get access

1206
00:46:23,220 --> 00:46:25,619
to open sources that we do not know

1207
00:46:25,619 --> 00:46:27,599
about because we can literally talk to

1208
00:46:27,599 --> 00:46:30,060
people so virtual humans is nothing more

1209
00:46:30,060 --> 00:46:32,040
than virtual human intelligence and its

1210
00:46:32,040 --> 00:46:34,740
intelligence derived and information

1211
00:46:34,740 --> 00:46:38,160
from Human sources that we can talk to

1212
00:46:38,160 --> 00:46:40,079
and this is particularly useful or at

1213
00:46:40,079 --> 00:46:42,300
least where I move use it mostly for for

1214
00:46:42,300 --> 00:46:44,339
breached and leaked data the people who

1215
00:46:44,339 --> 00:46:46,319
offer that or the hacker groups that are

1216
00:46:46,319 --> 00:46:48,119
involved with that for example I'm now

1217
00:46:48,119 --> 00:46:50,520
currently heavily involved in trying to

1218
00:46:50,520 --> 00:46:52,800
trace down the people behind kilnet now

1219
00:46:52,800 --> 00:46:54,720
some of you may be looking at it from a

1220
00:46:54,720 --> 00:46:56,520
different perspective maybe a more cyber

1221
00:46:56,520 --> 00:46:58,440
threat intelligence perspective but I'm

1222
00:46:58,440 --> 00:46:59,940
going to look at the human aspect

1223
00:46:59,940 --> 00:47:01,760
because in in the end it's people

1224
00:47:01,760 --> 00:47:04,260
operating puppeteering what they are

1225
00:47:04,260 --> 00:47:07,500
doing so I want to find those guys and

1226
00:47:07,500 --> 00:47:09,300
girls who are responsible for those

1227
00:47:09,300 --> 00:47:12,599
killnet maybe ddosing of a hospital or

1228
00:47:12,599 --> 00:47:14,640
something but I want to want to position

1229
00:47:14,640 --> 00:47:17,220
myself covertly in maybe their telegram

1230
00:47:17,220 --> 00:47:18,599
channels and learn what they are

1231
00:47:18,599 --> 00:47:20,339
planning and with that I could enforce

1232
00:47:20,339 --> 00:47:22,020
someone else or where they are talking

1233
00:47:22,020 --> 00:47:23,339
about that they want to have a certain

1234
00:47:23,339 --> 00:47:25,859
box yes five minutes I'm uh I'm almost

1235
00:47:25,859 --> 00:47:27,359
there

1236
00:47:27,359 --> 00:47:30,540
um so why is this important well the

1237
00:47:30,540 --> 00:47:33,060
internet is here it will not go away uh

1238
00:47:33,060 --> 00:47:34,619
there is simply more and more cyber

1239
00:47:34,619 --> 00:47:36,599
crime all around the world and these

1240
00:47:36,599 --> 00:47:39,540
online numbers will keep climbing and um

1241
00:47:39,540 --> 00:47:43,020
your sources are online so if you need

1242
00:47:43,020 --> 00:47:45,359
to do good if you want to fight the bad

1243
00:47:45,359 --> 00:47:47,640
guys and girls all around the world we

1244
00:47:47,640 --> 00:47:49,319
need to do some traditional work

1245
00:47:49,319 --> 00:47:52,619
combined with human intelligence now to

1246
00:47:52,619 --> 00:47:54,359
wrap this up slowly

1247
00:47:54,359 --> 00:47:56,400
um what is important we need to educate

1248
00:47:56,400 --> 00:47:58,380
people all around the world we need to

1249
00:47:58,380 --> 00:48:00,359
have tenacity and we need to have Nur

1250
00:48:00,359 --> 00:48:02,760
time and I asked for neurotime in all

1251
00:48:02,760 --> 00:48:04,380
the companies that I work for it stands

1252
00:48:04,380 --> 00:48:05,940
for never ending research and

1253
00:48:05,940 --> 00:48:10,380
development so I need time to explore

1254
00:48:10,380 --> 00:48:12,720
new stuff I need time to learn about a

1255
00:48:12,720 --> 00:48:14,579
new app and a tool how I could leverage

1256
00:48:14,579 --> 00:48:17,099
that within my investigation I need time

1257
00:48:17,099 --> 00:48:19,380
what a new M1 processor on a MacBook

1258
00:48:19,380 --> 00:48:21,119
means for my investigation because it

1259
00:48:21,119 --> 00:48:23,280
screws up your virtualization and I

1260
00:48:23,280 --> 00:48:25,740
heavily rely on virtualization so these

1261
00:48:25,740 --> 00:48:27,180
are all little hurdles that I need to

1262
00:48:27,180 --> 00:48:29,819
take I need to build personas longer

1263
00:48:29,819 --> 00:48:31,260
term shock puppets that I need the

1264
00:48:31,260 --> 00:48:33,660
position I need your help industry

1265
00:48:33,660 --> 00:48:36,300
experts from a different perspective so

1266
00:48:36,300 --> 00:48:38,819
I need those Partnerships and you also

1267
00:48:38,819 --> 00:48:40,800
need open source and gelatin Specialists

1268
00:48:40,800 --> 00:48:42,900
to perform what you need to do

1269
00:48:42,900 --> 00:48:47,540
so uh distant future web foreign

1270
00:48:47,540 --> 00:48:50,339
basically bigger data we have more

1271
00:48:50,339 --> 00:48:53,160
digital alter egos but I think a great

1272
00:48:53,160 --> 00:48:55,200
example is and this is kind of tying it

1273
00:48:55,200 --> 00:48:57,420
into a jet jet TDP is doing Google had

1274
00:48:57,420 --> 00:49:00,240
Lambda and the guy one of the guys at

1275
00:49:00,240 --> 00:49:01,800
Google who was behind Lambda basically

1276
00:49:01,800 --> 00:49:03,300
said hey we need to stop this because

1277
00:49:03,300 --> 00:49:05,220
it's getting a conscious

1278
00:49:05,220 --> 00:49:07,380
and that by itself

1279
00:49:07,380 --> 00:49:09,000
is kind of disturbing because if

1280
00:49:09,000 --> 00:49:10,800
computers are going to start thinking to

1281
00:49:10,800 --> 00:49:12,720
themselves we might see those

1282
00:49:12,720 --> 00:49:15,000
Terminators pop up here and there

1283
00:49:15,000 --> 00:49:17,280
so these are things that we need to deal

1284
00:49:17,280 --> 00:49:18,599
with and this is open source

1285
00:49:18,599 --> 00:49:21,180
intelligence so in the future the heavy

1286
00:49:21,180 --> 00:49:23,099
lifting will most likely be done by

1287
00:49:23,099 --> 00:49:24,960
machines in the form of algorithms

1288
00:49:24,960 --> 00:49:28,140
Hardware software wise but we still need

1289
00:49:28,140 --> 00:49:30,619
that traditional trade craft because

1290
00:49:30,619 --> 00:49:33,780
humans understand sarcasm idioms figure

1291
00:49:33,780 --> 00:49:35,760
of speech computers still have a very

1292
00:49:35,760 --> 00:49:38,099
hard time in interpreting that critical

1293
00:49:38,099 --> 00:49:39,420
thinking within open source and

1294
00:49:39,420 --> 00:49:40,740
challenges or in any form of

1295
00:49:40,740 --> 00:49:43,380
intelligence is to key to success doubt

1296
00:49:43,380 --> 00:49:44,280
everything

1297
00:49:44,280 --> 00:49:46,920
assume nothing check everything and the

1298
00:49:46,920 --> 00:49:48,480
final decision who will make the final

1299
00:49:48,480 --> 00:49:50,700
decision will it be a human or will it

1300
00:49:50,700 --> 00:49:52,079
be an algorithm

1301
00:49:52,079 --> 00:49:55,020
so with that to wrap it up

1302
00:49:55,020 --> 00:49:56,579
we need open source and challenges

1303
00:49:56,579 --> 00:49:58,440
investigators that have nerd time

1304
00:49:58,440 --> 00:50:00,300
they'll need to understand the trade

1305
00:50:00,300 --> 00:50:02,040
craft they will need to have proper

1306
00:50:02,040 --> 00:50:03,720
hardware and software now a lot of

1307
00:50:03,720 --> 00:50:05,700
companies will not always give people

1308
00:50:05,700 --> 00:50:08,400
the proper hardware and software so they

1309
00:50:08,400 --> 00:50:11,760
need that they need education budget of

1310
00:50:11,760 --> 00:50:13,920
course we will find more blind spots in

1311
00:50:13,920 --> 00:50:16,200
the near future but it also opens new

1312
00:50:16,200 --> 00:50:19,140
spots with new technology and actually

1313
00:50:19,140 --> 00:50:21,240
internet growth we basically need more

1314
00:50:21,240 --> 00:50:22,800
power in the form of humans and

1315
00:50:22,800 --> 00:50:24,180
computers and we need to be able to

1316
00:50:24,180 --> 00:50:27,839
adopt adapt and become an adapt of those

1317
00:50:27,839 --> 00:50:29,520
new technologies

1318
00:50:29,520 --> 00:50:31,380
so the future

1319
00:50:31,380 --> 00:50:34,200
well it's actually now not tomorrow

1320
00:50:34,200 --> 00:50:34,910
thank you

1321
00:50:34,910 --> 00:50:44,290
[Applause]

1322
00:50:44,460 --> 00:50:46,980
thank you so much my pleasure we have

1323
00:50:46,980 --> 00:50:48,420
some

1324
00:50:48,420 --> 00:50:51,300
a few minutes left for maybe a question

1325
00:50:51,300 --> 00:50:54,420
here's a question Chris

1326
00:50:54,420 --> 00:50:58,020
hi Nico as an ocean researcher how do

1327
00:50:58,020 --> 00:51:01,440
you prevent your confirmation bias in

1328
00:51:01,440 --> 00:51:02,819
the beginning of your talk you said well

1329
00:51:02,819 --> 00:51:04,680
you thought about a good question yeah

1330
00:51:04,680 --> 00:51:06,720
but there's so many data available on

1331
00:51:06,720 --> 00:51:08,460
the internet so you might find an answer

1332
00:51:08,460 --> 00:51:11,220
how do you reverse the process that once

1333
00:51:11,220 --> 00:51:13,319
you have an answer you say critically to

1334
00:51:13,319 --> 00:51:15,720
yourself is the false positive or do you

1335
00:51:15,720 --> 00:51:18,660
have reviewers or you just cut your mind

1336
00:51:18,660 --> 00:51:21,200
in two that's a good question

1337
00:51:21,200 --> 00:51:23,579
there are multiple playbooks to do that

1338
00:51:23,579 --> 00:51:25,800
so I like to use crap analysis and

1339
00:51:25,800 --> 00:51:27,660
that's something that I can discuss I

1340
00:51:27,660 --> 00:51:30,119
cannot go into now that the analysis of

1341
00:51:30,119 --> 00:51:31,880
competing hypothesis

1342
00:51:31,880 --> 00:51:34,559
critical thinking just in a group just

1343
00:51:34,559 --> 00:51:36,420
simply saying hey this is the evidence

1344
00:51:36,420 --> 00:51:38,819
that I found and used the power of the

1345
00:51:38,819 --> 00:51:40,800
group to point out maybe false positives

1346
00:51:40,800 --> 00:51:44,819
so there are uh two hands are not enough

1347
00:51:44,819 --> 00:51:47,160
to show the the possibilities that I

1348
00:51:47,160 --> 00:51:48,900
have to tackle my own biases and logical

1349
00:51:48,900 --> 00:51:50,700
fallacies yes very good question and

1350
00:51:50,700 --> 00:51:52,079
really important within open source

1351
00:51:52,079 --> 00:51:54,500
intelligence

1352
00:51:54,540 --> 00:51:56,400
any other questions yeah in the back

1353
00:51:56,400 --> 00:52:00,079
wait I'll come to you

1354
00:52:02,640 --> 00:52:05,280
so uh what are some of the more ethical

1355
00:52:05,280 --> 00:52:06,599
questions you asked yourself before

1356
00:52:06,599 --> 00:52:09,000
taking on an assignment so let's say I'm

1357
00:52:09,000 --> 00:52:11,579
a operator of killnet and I want to see

1358
00:52:11,579 --> 00:52:13,859
what you can find out about me so like

1359
00:52:13,859 --> 00:52:15,839
uh kind of a counterintelligence

1360
00:52:15,839 --> 00:52:17,819
perspective like how how do you get

1361
00:52:17,819 --> 00:52:19,200
through that before taking on the

1362
00:52:19,200 --> 00:52:20,220
assignments

1363
00:52:20,220 --> 00:52:22,440
yeah that's a good question I'm um of

1364
00:52:22,440 --> 00:52:26,520
course I don't always know um who well I

1365
00:52:26,520 --> 00:52:28,020
always know who are my clients because

1366
00:52:28,020 --> 00:52:30,480
I'm I only will take in clients that I

1367
00:52:30,480 --> 00:52:32,220
can meet face to face to face otherwise

1368
00:52:32,220 --> 00:52:35,460
I will not work with you but on average

1369
00:52:35,460 --> 00:52:37,800
um you could put in certain choke points

1370
00:52:37,800 --> 00:52:39,900
in your investigation where you set up

1371
00:52:39,900 --> 00:52:41,700
certain processes where you make sure

1372
00:52:41,700 --> 00:52:43,559
that the other end of the line is

1373
00:52:43,559 --> 00:52:45,240
actually the person that you are

1374
00:52:45,240 --> 00:52:47,040
communicating with and not someone else

1375
00:52:47,040 --> 00:52:48,960
so there are multiple techniques

1376
00:52:48,960 --> 00:52:51,359
hardware and software wise to make sure

1377
00:52:51,359 --> 00:52:54,480
well nothing is 100 certain but sure

1378
00:52:54,480 --> 00:52:56,640
enough that you will have let's say

1379
00:52:56,640 --> 00:52:58,500
enough confidence and comfort that you

1380
00:52:58,500 --> 00:52:59,940
were actually dealing with the person

1381
00:52:59,940 --> 00:53:03,480
that you want to deal with or not

1382
00:53:03,480 --> 00:53:07,440
okay one last question Maybe

1383
00:53:07,440 --> 00:53:09,359
yes

1384
00:53:09,359 --> 00:53:13,319
yeah Nico during covert times some Dutch

1385
00:53:13,319 --> 00:53:16,140
companies were scraping telegram groups

1386
00:53:16,140 --> 00:53:17,880
twitch groups whatever as a business

1387
00:53:17,880 --> 00:53:20,400
model and selling the data to other

1388
00:53:20,400 --> 00:53:22,920
companies what do you think about this

1389
00:53:22,920 --> 00:53:25,200
what my opinion about that is

1390
00:53:25,200 --> 00:53:28,859
um it depends on the goal that's making

1391
00:53:28,859 --> 00:53:31,220
money

1392
00:53:32,280 --> 00:53:35,220
yeah but um also keep in mind a lot of

1393
00:53:35,220 --> 00:53:37,020
companies are technically not capable of

1394
00:53:37,020 --> 00:53:38,520
doing that themselves so they are

1395
00:53:38,520 --> 00:53:40,559
willing to buy it the same counts for

1396
00:53:40,559 --> 00:53:43,020
breach data some people buy breach data

1397
00:53:43,020 --> 00:53:45,000
because they simply want to have it

1398
00:53:45,000 --> 00:53:47,160
stopped so yeah my personal opinion I

1399
00:53:47,160 --> 00:53:48,420
don't

1400
00:53:48,420 --> 00:53:50,160
I don't ever want to deal with criminals

1401
00:53:50,160 --> 00:53:52,260
or don't pay any criminal activities but

1402
00:53:52,260 --> 00:53:53,940
I do see that there is a need in the

1403
00:53:53,940 --> 00:53:56,099
market for it simply because well just

1404
00:53:56,099 --> 00:53:57,420
like I stated there's too much

1405
00:53:57,420 --> 00:53:59,040
information out there and if you're a

1406
00:53:59,040 --> 00:54:00,900
small company you need to do this on

1407
00:54:00,900 --> 00:54:03,300
your own or if you're not capable you

1408
00:54:03,300 --> 00:54:05,040
will probably need to go to certain

1409
00:54:05,040 --> 00:54:08,240
vendors that will do that

1410
00:54:08,819 --> 00:54:11,819
okay thank you so much Nico my pleasure

1411
00:54:11,819 --> 00:54:13,859
everyone give it up again for Nico

1412
00:54:13,859 --> 00:54:16,220
