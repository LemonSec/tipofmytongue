1
00:00:00,599 --> 00:00:02,940
welcome everybody

2
00:00:02,940 --> 00:00:05,040
um like you can see our presentation is

3
00:00:05,040 --> 00:00:07,259
called doomsday scenarios that we hope

4
00:00:07,259 --> 00:00:10,139
we're preventing and we hope to tell you

5
00:00:10,139 --> 00:00:11,820
a little bit more about this

6
00:00:11,820 --> 00:00:13,620
so I'm going to start telling you about

7
00:00:13,620 --> 00:00:15,839
what the DI video is and how it started

8
00:00:15,839 --> 00:00:19,440
it started in 2019 by Austin's fixer and

9
00:00:19,440 --> 00:00:21,660
Chris who are all here so can we get a

10
00:00:21,660 --> 00:00:24,380
little Applause for them

11
00:00:25,320 --> 00:00:28,140
and they started this with a dream to

12
00:00:28,140 --> 00:00:29,939
make the internet safer

13
00:00:29,939 --> 00:00:32,940
so that dream led to a mission statement

14
00:00:32,940 --> 00:00:35,760
we aim to make the digital world safer

15
00:00:35,760 --> 00:00:38,219
by reporting vulnerabilities we find in

16
00:00:38,219 --> 00:00:40,200
digital systems to the people who can

17
00:00:40,200 --> 00:00:42,420
fix them we have a global reach but we

18
00:00:42,420 --> 00:00:44,760
do it in a Dutch style open honest

19
00:00:44,760 --> 00:00:48,300
collaborative and for free

20
00:00:48,300 --> 00:00:51,480
so how is that going well since 2019

21
00:00:51,480 --> 00:00:53,399
we've grown a lot we have a serious

22
00:00:53,399 --> 00:00:56,219
management team various departments we

23
00:00:56,219 --> 00:00:57,899
have our own I.T Department that's

24
00:00:57,899 --> 00:00:59,640
responsible for our own infrastructure

25
00:00:59,640 --> 00:01:02,039
we are starting by HR departments to

26
00:01:02,039 --> 00:01:04,199
manage the over 100 volunteers that have

27
00:01:04,199 --> 00:01:06,180
since joined the organization we have

28
00:01:06,180 --> 00:01:08,340
Communications Department and so on it's

29
00:01:08,340 --> 00:01:09,840
really starting to become a serious

30
00:01:09,840 --> 00:01:10,920
organization

31
00:01:10,920 --> 00:01:13,680
and we have some impressive Feats in

32
00:01:13,680 --> 00:01:16,140
that time we made global news as The

33
00:01:16,140 --> 00:01:17,580
Institute that disclosed the zero days

34
00:01:17,580 --> 00:01:20,040
in casea that were eventually used by

35
00:01:20,040 --> 00:01:22,200
our evil and what some people claim to

36
00:01:22,200 --> 00:01:23,640
be the largest ransomware attack in

37
00:01:23,640 --> 00:01:25,740
history but that's absolutely debatable

38
00:01:25,740 --> 00:01:27,360
if it was

39
00:01:27,360 --> 00:01:29,280
um we've published disclosures that led

40
00:01:29,280 --> 00:01:31,259
to uh questions being asked in the Dutch

41
00:01:31,259 --> 00:01:32,220
Parliament

42
00:01:32,220 --> 00:01:34,619
we were name dropped in 2021 at blackout

43
00:01:34,619 --> 00:01:37,079
Vegas by uh in the keynote of China

44
00:01:37,079 --> 00:01:41,040
history from sisa and recently the Dutch

45
00:01:41,040 --> 00:01:42,960
Justice and security minister has said

46
00:01:42,960 --> 00:01:45,479
that we are allowed and capable of doing

47
00:01:45,479 --> 00:01:48,360
things that they simply can't and that

48
00:01:48,360 --> 00:01:50,100
with that we're a very important

49
00:01:50,100 --> 00:01:53,040
Organization for the cyber security

50
00:01:53,040 --> 00:01:54,960
infrastructure in the Netherlands

51
00:01:54,960 --> 00:01:57,479
so during this talk

52
00:01:57,479 --> 00:01:59,579
will sometimes say things about how

53
00:01:59,579 --> 00:02:01,439
broken things are how bad something

54
00:02:01,439 --> 00:02:03,720
could be exploited and I really want to

55
00:02:03,720 --> 00:02:06,600
remind all of you where the volunteer

56
00:02:06,600 --> 00:02:08,699
firefighters on the internet we promise

57
00:02:08,699 --> 00:02:11,400
we're not evil so when I talk about this

58
00:02:11,400 --> 00:02:13,260
could absolutely have been broken

59
00:02:13,260 --> 00:02:15,000
Etc we're not the guys that's going to

60
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:17,879
do that so in those cases remember kinds

61
00:02:17,879 --> 00:02:19,739
people firefighters

62
00:02:19,739 --> 00:02:22,440
so I'll first introduce myself

63
00:02:22,440 --> 00:02:25,260
my name is Nana Dalton I'm a hacker and

64
00:02:25,260 --> 00:02:27,120
a hacknell's crime advocate

65
00:02:27,120 --> 00:02:29,280
in my day job I worked as a security

66
00:02:29,280 --> 00:02:31,200
Analyst at zero culture where I got to

67
00:02:31,200 --> 00:02:33,420
see some of the coolest reports of some

68
00:02:33,420 --> 00:02:35,340
of the best hackers in the world triage

69
00:02:35,340 --> 00:02:37,560
them and work with our customers to uh

70
00:02:37,560 --> 00:02:39,959
remediate those and then in my free time

71
00:02:39,959 --> 00:02:42,540
I work as head of sea swords as the day

72
00:02:42,540 --> 00:02:46,200
today where I well working with hackers

73
00:02:46,200 --> 00:02:47,760
coordinating hackers is sometimes

74
00:02:47,760 --> 00:02:49,739
herding cats as many of you will know

75
00:02:49,739 --> 00:02:51,780
but we try to keep it a little bit

76
00:02:51,780 --> 00:02:54,720
structure to run our cases and have an

77
00:02:54,720 --> 00:02:56,879
organization that works if you want to

78
00:02:56,879 --> 00:02:58,200
know more about me you can find me on

79
00:02:58,200 --> 00:03:00,120
Twitter handles on the screen and I'm

80
00:03:00,120 --> 00:03:01,620
doing this presentation together with

81
00:03:01,620 --> 00:03:04,739
Rolf horn we'll now introduce himself

82
00:03:04,739 --> 00:03:06,599
well I'm Ralph

83
00:03:06,599 --> 00:03:08,459
um a Dave day I'm a team lead for level

84
00:03:08,459 --> 00:03:10,920
one cases which essentially means the

85
00:03:10,920 --> 00:03:12,959
big open cases with well-known

86
00:03:12,959 --> 00:03:16,260
vulnerabilities and in my day job I work

87
00:03:16,260 --> 00:03:18,239
at instance response in North Wave

88
00:03:18,239 --> 00:03:20,280
and I really like doing things in

89
00:03:20,280 --> 00:03:23,599
Creative intelligence community

90
00:03:23,940 --> 00:03:26,640
so what evil lurks in the dark for those

91
00:03:26,640 --> 00:03:29,040
who are unfamiliar with what the

92
00:03:29,040 --> 00:03:31,260
internet looks like we picked out a few

93
00:03:31,260 --> 00:03:33,780
this is not an exhaustive list you can

94
00:03:33,780 --> 00:03:36,780
have comments on this list

95
00:03:36,780 --> 00:03:38,640
um Talk a bit about crime groups initial

96
00:03:38,640 --> 00:03:41,220
access brokers ransomware

97
00:03:41,220 --> 00:03:44,940
activism so thank you very much solder

98
00:03:44,940 --> 00:03:47,700
for these very kind pictures

99
00:03:47,700 --> 00:03:49,920
um so initial access Brokers essentially

100
00:03:49,920 --> 00:03:52,319
they're financially motivated as all

101
00:03:52,319 --> 00:03:56,099
criminals are they sell access on forums

102
00:03:56,099 --> 00:03:59,700
or they sell it privately to either

103
00:03:59,700 --> 00:04:03,299
stately actors or transfer groups

104
00:04:03,299 --> 00:04:05,640
they pretty much use anything that works

105
00:04:05,640 --> 00:04:08,459
which can be credential phishing can be

106
00:04:08,459 --> 00:04:11,459
fishing with malware such as cubots or

107
00:04:11,459 --> 00:04:14,340
Brute Force services or

108
00:04:14,340 --> 00:04:17,880
whatever is the flavor of today

109
00:04:17,880 --> 00:04:19,500
and we have ransomware I think everyone

110
00:04:19,500 --> 00:04:21,959
pretty much knows ransomware they're

111
00:04:21,959 --> 00:04:24,060
financially motivated they will encrypt

112
00:04:24,060 --> 00:04:26,540
steal your data pretty much extort you

113
00:04:26,540 --> 00:04:29,220
payment is often done in cryptocurrency

114
00:04:29,220 --> 00:04:32,400
or is done in cryptocurrency such as BTC

115
00:04:32,400 --> 00:04:34,800
or Monera

116
00:04:34,800 --> 00:04:37,320
um they will obtain access to themselves

117
00:04:37,320 --> 00:04:39,180
or they will just buy access depending

118
00:04:39,180 --> 00:04:41,340
on the group

119
00:04:41,340 --> 00:04:43,380
any move lettering your domain to pretty

120
00:04:43,380 --> 00:04:45,500
much own everything that's windows and

121
00:04:45,500 --> 00:04:49,680
Well Done encrypted

122
00:04:49,680 --> 00:04:51,780
um now we have a bit of hactifism it's

123
00:04:51,780 --> 00:04:54,360
often politically motivated actual skill

124
00:04:54,360 --> 00:04:56,699
also widely varies

125
00:04:56,699 --> 00:04:58,740
um they can be more determined than for

126
00:04:58,740 --> 00:05:00,600
example access group because they have a

127
00:05:00,600 --> 00:05:03,600
cause to fight for

128
00:05:03,600 --> 00:05:05,280
um and they're often not financially

129
00:05:05,280 --> 00:05:07,620
motivated

130
00:05:07,620 --> 00:05:10,440
so as Dave day we spin a lot on the

131
00:05:10,440 --> 00:05:12,060
internet

132
00:05:12,060 --> 00:05:14,280
um so what does the wild world the

133
00:05:14,280 --> 00:05:17,639
worldwide worldwide web look like

134
00:05:17,639 --> 00:05:21,199
who knows this picture

135
00:05:21,800 --> 00:05:25,080
anyone else it's a bit different

136
00:05:25,080 --> 00:05:27,440
discipline

137
00:05:29,280 --> 00:05:31,740
this picture must be more familiar and

138
00:05:31,740 --> 00:05:33,120
there we know this picture and then

139
00:05:33,120 --> 00:05:34,560
everyone pretty much knows it so

140
00:05:34,560 --> 00:05:36,479
exchange what is it

141
00:05:36,479 --> 00:05:38,220
um it's pretty much a mill Surfer it's

142
00:05:38,220 --> 00:05:40,440
on-prem but Microsoft it's absolutely

143
00:05:40,440 --> 00:05:43,979
broken and you should not use it

144
00:05:43,979 --> 00:05:46,320
um it's just heavily by companies that

145
00:05:46,320 --> 00:05:49,340
did not want or could move to the clouds

146
00:05:49,340 --> 00:05:52,080
or to off 365.

147
00:05:52,080 --> 00:05:54,720
and you have a researcher by the name of

148
00:05:54,720 --> 00:05:56,460
orange Tsai who published a bunch of

149
00:05:56,460 --> 00:05:58,020
vulnerabilities

150
00:05:58,020 --> 00:06:01,860
um first one starting on 2nd of March

151
00:06:01,860 --> 00:06:04,020
um and we started scanning on the 3rd of

152
00:06:04,020 --> 00:06:04,919
March

153
00:06:04,919 --> 00:06:07,800
and well exchanges are pretty much easy

154
00:06:07,800 --> 00:06:09,479
to exploit if you either have

155
00:06:09,479 --> 00:06:11,280
credentials or if it's just outdated

156
00:06:11,280 --> 00:06:12,720
enough

157
00:06:12,720 --> 00:06:15,419
so what's the problem with it uh a proxy

158
00:06:15,419 --> 00:06:18,600
free of RC chain which essentially means

159
00:06:18,600 --> 00:06:20,400
you can get remote codes execution on a

160
00:06:20,400 --> 00:06:21,979
mailbox

161
00:06:21,979 --> 00:06:25,199
and exchanges when this all dropped and

162
00:06:25,199 --> 00:06:27,360
started they were

163
00:06:27,360 --> 00:06:29,819
often Exposed on the internet in a way

164
00:06:29,819 --> 00:06:31,680
that they should not be exposed on the

165
00:06:31,680 --> 00:06:33,000
internet

166
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:35,220
like this

167
00:06:35,220 --> 00:06:37,560
so on the 3rd of March 2021 you can see

168
00:06:37,560 --> 00:06:39,479
that there's over 40 000 exchange

169
00:06:39,479 --> 00:06:41,940
servers that are vulnerable to the

170
00:06:41,940 --> 00:06:43,020
original

171
00:06:43,020 --> 00:06:45,900
vulnerability in exchange or about proxy

172
00:06:45,900 --> 00:06:47,819
logo

173
00:06:47,819 --> 00:06:50,699
you can see people are starting to patch

174
00:06:50,699 --> 00:06:53,759
a few days later and then a new scanning

175
00:06:53,759 --> 00:06:55,380
method is developed and we found even

176
00:06:55,380 --> 00:06:57,960
more vulnerable servers and when you

177
00:06:57,960 --> 00:06:59,819
think of this this is potentially over

178
00:06:59,819 --> 00:07:02,880
forty thousand companies

179
00:07:02,880 --> 00:07:05,580
that have an exchange server that's used

180
00:07:05,580 --> 00:07:07,319
by ransomware that can be used by

181
00:07:07,319 --> 00:07:09,539
transfer actors to get access to your

182
00:07:09,539 --> 00:07:11,340
network and they will encrypt it and

183
00:07:11,340 --> 00:07:14,000
they will use it

184
00:07:14,940 --> 00:07:17,639
and you're thinking this was 2021 and we

185
00:07:17,639 --> 00:07:19,740
had some vulnerabilities also in 2022

186
00:07:19,740 --> 00:07:23,039
it's still relevant yes it is uh our

187
00:07:23,039 --> 00:07:25,199
ssrf this new one

188
00:07:25,199 --> 00:07:25,979
um

189
00:07:25,979 --> 00:07:28,139
found I believe uh originally by the

190
00:07:28,139 --> 00:07:29,639
player ransomware group

191
00:07:29,639 --> 00:07:31,979
they use it a lot to exploit things such

192
00:07:31,979 --> 00:07:34,818
as Rackspace

193
00:07:35,460 --> 00:07:36,780
so yeah

194
00:07:36,780 --> 00:07:38,400
you might want to not want to expose

195
00:07:38,400 --> 00:07:41,039
this thing on the internet or at least

196
00:07:41,039 --> 00:07:43,259
pretty much batch it

197
00:07:43,259 --> 00:07:46,020
let's talk about more fun things

198
00:07:46,020 --> 00:07:48,300
so who writes news about the esxi runs

199
00:07:48,300 --> 00:07:50,539
aware

200
00:07:51,419 --> 00:07:52,740
yeah

201
00:07:52,740 --> 00:07:55,319
you're at it

202
00:07:55,319 --> 00:07:56,039
um

203
00:07:56,039 --> 00:07:58,800
here's the news article so what's wrong

204
00:07:58,800 --> 00:08:02,759
with es6i on the internet pretty much a

205
00:08:02,759 --> 00:08:05,580
lot so you almost have 15K vulnerable

206
00:08:05,580 --> 00:08:09,120
esxi hosts on the internet that had open

207
00:08:09,120 --> 00:08:12,720
sop exposed that can be used or could be

208
00:08:12,720 --> 00:08:14,699
used by a ranswer actor to

209
00:08:14,699 --> 00:08:17,280
exploit CPE 2021

210
00:08:17,280 --> 00:08:20,180
21974

211
00:08:20,180 --> 00:08:22,800
currently there have been two ranswer

212
00:08:22,800 --> 00:08:25,440
waves or at least in the recent month

213
00:08:25,440 --> 00:08:28,319
and a half a few months before

214
00:08:28,319 --> 00:08:30,720
so what's the true problem there are

215
00:08:30,720 --> 00:08:33,360
hosts on the internet that are unable to

216
00:08:33,360 --> 00:08:36,419
upgrade they have a vulnerable version

217
00:08:36,419 --> 00:08:37,979
that spins

218
00:08:37,979 --> 00:08:40,320
by their either their Dell surf or maybe

219
00:08:40,320 --> 00:08:42,059
their service provider such as of

220
00:08:42,059 --> 00:08:44,580
retzner

221
00:08:44,580 --> 00:08:46,140
um so this

222
00:08:46,140 --> 00:08:48,060
creates a weird situation where your

223
00:08:48,060 --> 00:08:49,560
customer will have two pop-ups please

224
00:08:49,560 --> 00:08:50,700
patch

225
00:08:50,700 --> 00:08:52,200
no you cannot patch because you're

226
00:08:52,200 --> 00:08:54,860
locked to this version

227
00:08:55,019 --> 00:08:57,839
internet is broken

228
00:08:57,839 --> 00:09:00,360
let's talk about more broken things look

229
00:09:00,360 --> 00:09:01,920
for shell

230
00:09:01,920 --> 00:09:06,360
well thank you Axel for this picture

231
00:09:06,360 --> 00:09:07,380
um

232
00:09:07,380 --> 00:09:08,940
love for sure what's wrong with it

233
00:09:08,940 --> 00:09:11,279
pretty much a lot you can find it in

234
00:09:11,279 --> 00:09:12,080
everything

235
00:09:12,080 --> 00:09:16,500
you had a several cfes originally

236
00:09:16,500 --> 00:09:17,519
um

237
00:09:17,519 --> 00:09:19,800
and this dropped and it was in

238
00:09:19,800 --> 00:09:20,880
everything

239
00:09:20,880 --> 00:09:22,980
so to quote a certain someone from the

240
00:09:22,980 --> 00:09:24,120
everyday

241
00:09:24,120 --> 00:09:26,700
thank you Frank look for J is like sugar

242
00:09:26,700 --> 00:09:29,100
it's in everything even in things you

243
00:09:29,100 --> 00:09:30,420
don't expect

244
00:09:30,420 --> 00:09:32,040
like this

245
00:09:32,040 --> 00:09:33,779
so yeah some people thought it was funny

246
00:09:33,779 --> 00:09:35,820
to put in G in the airplane on an RFID

247
00:09:35,820 --> 00:09:37,920
scanner

248
00:09:37,920 --> 00:09:40,140
and it's rigored

249
00:09:40,140 --> 00:09:41,459
so

250
00:09:41,459 --> 00:09:43,620
let's talk about like what could be

251
00:09:43,620 --> 00:09:44,760
exploited

252
00:09:44,760 --> 00:09:47,700
RFID based access systems mobile device

253
00:09:47,700 --> 00:09:50,240
management I'll get back to that one

254
00:09:50,240 --> 00:09:53,040
hypervisors digital workspace platforms

255
00:09:53,040 --> 00:09:55,860
and most of these have also been used as

256
00:09:55,860 --> 00:09:58,080
initial access for ransomware but also

257
00:09:58,080 --> 00:09:59,880
for empty groups

258
00:09:59,880 --> 00:10:02,940
and especially the mdm1 we found it's

259
00:10:02,940 --> 00:10:04,880
pretty interesting at day today

260
00:10:04,880 --> 00:10:08,339
we found a mobile device management of a

261
00:10:08,339 --> 00:10:11,700
major Western Telecom provider several

262
00:10:11,700 --> 00:10:13,800
that was exposed to the internet that

263
00:10:13,800 --> 00:10:17,060
managed their internal Network

264
00:10:17,220 --> 00:10:18,959
well pretty much an easy way to take

265
00:10:18,959 --> 00:10:20,940
this over

266
00:10:20,940 --> 00:10:23,339
let's talk about more fun things

267
00:10:23,339 --> 00:10:26,100
yeah this one also particularly fun for

268
00:10:26,100 --> 00:10:26,820
us

269
00:10:26,820 --> 00:10:28,620
I think some of you may have heard about

270
00:10:28,620 --> 00:10:31,500
caseya anyway guys you've heard about it

271
00:10:31,500 --> 00:10:33,800
but don't exactly know what it is

272
00:10:33,800 --> 00:10:36,959
uh the product is called which stands

273
00:10:36,959 --> 00:10:39,240
for virtual assistant administrator and

274
00:10:39,240 --> 00:10:42,180
it's used by msps to remotely manage

275
00:10:42,180 --> 00:10:44,519
their clients so if vulnerability in

276
00:10:44,519 --> 00:10:45,600
this product

277
00:10:45,600 --> 00:10:49,019
you can potentially hit many endpoints

278
00:10:49,019 --> 00:10:50,339
that are managed by the single version

279
00:10:50,339 --> 00:10:52,079
of these products

280
00:10:52,079 --> 00:10:54,899
so what was actually wrong with it

281
00:10:54,899 --> 00:10:56,459
um these are

282
00:10:56,459 --> 00:10:58,500
zero days well no longer zero days

283
00:10:58,500 --> 00:11:00,839
because they've been disclosed since but

284
00:11:00,839 --> 00:11:02,220
these are vulnerabilities that are found

285
00:11:02,220 --> 00:11:04,380
by vitzvonster one of the Dave Lay

286
00:11:04,380 --> 00:11:06,240
researchers

287
00:11:06,240 --> 00:11:08,040
um so what did he find these are the

288
00:11:08,040 --> 00:11:09,899
seven initial cves that we found in our

289
00:11:09,899 --> 00:11:12,240
a credential leak and business logic

290
00:11:12,240 --> 00:11:15,180
flow some good old SQL injection

291
00:11:15,180 --> 00:11:17,700
remote code execution Central side

292
00:11:17,700 --> 00:11:19,040
scripting

293
00:11:19,040 --> 00:11:22,560
bypass a local file inclusion an XML

294
00:11:22,560 --> 00:11:24,480
external entity vulnerability so yeah

295
00:11:24,480 --> 00:11:26,160
pretty much a lot of different

296
00:11:26,160 --> 00:11:28,320
vulnerabilities in single products that

297
00:11:28,320 --> 00:11:30,779
was absolutely a lot of wrong with this

298
00:11:30,779 --> 00:11:33,600
and while each of them is absolutely

299
00:11:33,600 --> 00:11:37,680
very critical already and can be abused

300
00:11:37,680 --> 00:11:40,440
we came up with a way to change some of

301
00:11:40,440 --> 00:11:43,019
them to yeah

302
00:11:43,019 --> 00:11:47,040
have an even more impact for exploits

303
00:11:47,040 --> 00:11:49,860
so there are two the end goal for this

304
00:11:49,860 --> 00:11:52,380
project will be reaching the uh task

305
00:11:52,380 --> 00:11:54,600
list because using this we could deploy

306
00:11:54,600 --> 00:11:55,920
tasks to the hosts that were being

307
00:11:55,920 --> 00:11:58,320
managed and those not only attack the

308
00:11:58,320 --> 00:12:00,000
server itself but it's like all the

309
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:02,940
endpoints it was managing and we found

310
00:12:02,940 --> 00:12:06,360
two ways initially to reaches obviously

311
00:12:06,360 --> 00:12:08,519
the unauthenticator's remote execution

312
00:12:08,519 --> 00:12:11,820
is just yeah go and game over and then

313
00:12:11,820 --> 00:12:14,820
we had an authentication bypass and then

314
00:12:14,820 --> 00:12:17,160
an authenticated SQL injection which

315
00:12:17,160 --> 00:12:19,320
would also lead us to the same point and

316
00:12:19,320 --> 00:12:20,880
once you reach the task list you can

317
00:12:20,880 --> 00:12:23,100
just deploy commands to the endpoints

318
00:12:23,100 --> 00:12:24,600
tell them to

319
00:12:24,600 --> 00:12:27,600
pop calc or drop ransomware

320
00:12:27,600 --> 00:12:29,959
and yeah

321
00:12:29,959 --> 00:12:32,700
that's regardless too this is very

322
00:12:32,700 --> 00:12:34,680
broken but how bad is this on the

323
00:12:34,680 --> 00:12:37,019
internet so we did some baseline scans

324
00:12:37,019 --> 00:12:38,880
while in the process of the disclosure

325
00:12:38,880 --> 00:12:40,560
of a Defender you're like okay so

326
00:12:40,560 --> 00:12:43,500
there's roughly 2 300 systems online

327
00:12:43,500 --> 00:12:47,279
and then this happens

328
00:12:47,279 --> 00:12:50,459
second of July on a Friday uh start of

329
00:12:50,459 --> 00:12:52,680
the Fourth of July weekend in America so

330
00:12:52,680 --> 00:12:54,440
a lot of people are not really working

331
00:12:54,440 --> 00:12:57,000
partying on boats lighting fireworks

332
00:12:57,000 --> 00:13:00,000
American things and then a ransomware

333
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:02,880
ransomware gang Falls hey that's a good

334
00:13:02,880 --> 00:13:06,600
time to do this so they launched a

335
00:13:06,600 --> 00:13:09,540
ransomware attack against uh

336
00:13:09,540 --> 00:13:13,500
and of the 2400 of the 2300 hosts that

337
00:13:13,500 --> 00:13:15,660
we were seeing online they only affected

338
00:13:15,660 --> 00:13:18,839
60 direct customers of caseya but as I

339
00:13:18,839 --> 00:13:20,459
explained earlier you can then affect

340
00:13:20,459 --> 00:13:22,800
the endpoints behind that which means

341
00:13:22,800 --> 00:13:25,920
that Downstream up to 1500 victims were

342
00:13:25,920 --> 00:13:28,019
faxes even though only 60 direct

343
00:13:28,019 --> 00:13:30,180
customers were affected so in that sense

344
00:13:30,180 --> 00:13:32,760
this exact own a product like this is

345
00:13:32,760 --> 00:13:34,200
really a forced multiplier for an

346
00:13:34,200 --> 00:13:35,700
attacker

347
00:13:35,700 --> 00:13:37,560
um well with the 1500 Downstream

348
00:13:37,560 --> 00:13:39,899
customers affected they were demanding

349
00:13:39,899 --> 00:13:43,320
70 million dollars for a universal

350
00:13:43,320 --> 00:13:45,060
decrypter that would help all the

351
00:13:45,060 --> 00:13:47,519
victims and from that 70 million number

352
00:13:47,519 --> 00:13:49,440
is also where a lot of people estimate

353
00:13:49,440 --> 00:13:50,820
like oh this is the biggest ransomware

354
00:13:50,820 --> 00:13:52,860
attack ever because biggest Ransom

355
00:13:52,860 --> 00:13:55,220
demand

356
00:13:55,620 --> 00:13:57,360
um of course that's happening while we

357
00:13:57,360 --> 00:13:58,620
were already in the process of

358
00:13:58,620 --> 00:14:02,399
disclosing to the vendor made us ask did

359
00:14:02,399 --> 00:14:04,380
our disclosure got compromised somewhere

360
00:14:04,380 --> 00:14:06,180
maybe because I was hacked and it was

361
00:14:06,180 --> 00:14:08,220
disclosed on their end or have we been

362
00:14:08,220 --> 00:14:09,839
under attack has any communication been

363
00:14:09,839 --> 00:14:11,160
intercepted

364
00:14:11,160 --> 00:14:13,260
so luckily there was some analysis of

365
00:14:13,260 --> 00:14:15,839
the actual attack and they use different

366
00:14:15,839 --> 00:14:18,360
vulnerabilities than we did they did use

367
00:14:18,360 --> 00:14:20,579
the same authentication bypass but after

368
00:14:20,579 --> 00:14:22,860
that they used a file upload and a local

369
00:14:22,860 --> 00:14:25,560
filing conclusion to again reach the

370
00:14:25,560 --> 00:14:27,240
same task list and deploy their

371
00:14:27,240 --> 00:14:29,760
ransomware so we're quite happy with

372
00:14:29,760 --> 00:14:31,920
that because it's yeah if they had known

373
00:14:31,920 --> 00:14:34,200
all the vulnerabilities we had they

374
00:14:34,200 --> 00:14:35,760
would have used an easier attack than

375
00:14:35,760 --> 00:14:37,980
the path that they took

376
00:14:37,980 --> 00:14:40,680
so then how does remediation adoption go

377
00:14:40,680 --> 00:14:43,199
in such case well I say I was absolutely

378
00:14:43,199 --> 00:14:45,959
world news so you see a massive drop in

379
00:14:45,959 --> 00:14:49,260
systems online like overnights

380
00:14:49,260 --> 00:14:51,959
you see the big drop and then

381
00:14:51,959 --> 00:14:53,639
a couple of days to a week later it's

382
00:14:53,639 --> 00:14:55,440
pretty much gone

383
00:14:55,440 --> 00:14:57,899
um the attack started on a Friday

384
00:14:57,899 --> 00:15:00,240
evening and as the everyday we're very

385
00:15:00,240 --> 00:15:02,699
proud of the result that by Sunday all

386
00:15:02,699 --> 00:15:04,019
the systems in the Netherlands at least

387
00:15:04,019 --> 00:15:06,560
were offline

388
00:15:06,660 --> 00:15:09,540
so that brings us to the question are we

389
00:15:09,540 --> 00:15:11,339
actually helping we're trying to measure

390
00:15:11,339 --> 00:15:14,220
impacts because we scan and then we not

391
00:15:14,220 --> 00:15:15,779
fire streams possible which means that

392
00:15:15,779 --> 00:15:17,639
often we don't really have historical

393
00:15:17,639 --> 00:15:20,519
data about factshad option we don't know

394
00:15:20,519 --> 00:15:23,399
with what kind of Trends the vulnerable

395
00:15:23,399 --> 00:15:24,720
systems on the internet were already

396
00:15:24,720 --> 00:15:26,519
going down before we sent our

397
00:15:26,519 --> 00:15:28,680
notifications so it's hard to tell if

398
00:15:28,680 --> 00:15:30,000
our notifications have really changed

399
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:31,079
anything

400
00:15:31,079 --> 00:15:33,660
luckily we recently called a break on

401
00:15:33,660 --> 00:15:34,620
this issue

402
00:15:34,620 --> 00:15:36,420
and it was just this case

403
00:15:36,420 --> 00:15:40,019
uh John who from Fox I see published a

404
00:15:40,019 --> 00:15:45,000
blog post about two cfes in Citrix and

405
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:46,800
measuring the version of the option on

406
00:15:46,800 --> 00:15:48,839
the internet so in this case they had

407
00:15:48,839 --> 00:15:50,639
the historical data and they were

408
00:15:50,639 --> 00:15:51,899
willing to share both their

409
00:15:51,899 --> 00:15:53,639
fingerprinting methods and the

410
00:15:53,639 --> 00:15:56,279
historical data with us

411
00:15:56,279 --> 00:15:57,660
um the vulnerabilities that this is

412
00:15:57,660 --> 00:16:00,000
about are an authorized access to

413
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:03,300
Gateway user capabilities and then again

414
00:16:03,300 --> 00:16:05,220
and authenticated from what it's called

415
00:16:05,220 --> 00:16:07,620
arbitrary you must got execution

416
00:16:07,620 --> 00:16:10,019
T had a very benign fingerprint based on

417
00:16:10,019 --> 00:16:12,600
hashes so it was first very low impact

418
00:16:12,600 --> 00:16:15,000
on the systems to scan them and they had

419
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:17,220
historical data that we were very happy

420
00:16:17,220 --> 00:16:18,720
about as you'll see in the next few

421
00:16:18,720 --> 00:16:20,160
slides

422
00:16:20,160 --> 00:16:21,959
because here we see the remediation

423
00:16:21,959 --> 00:16:24,120
adoption

424
00:16:24,120 --> 00:16:25,560
um we'll zoom in on the grass a bit

425
00:16:25,560 --> 00:16:27,000
later because I understand that you can

426
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:30,060
probably see this the first line is uh

427
00:16:30,060 --> 00:16:33,899
when Citrix published their patch block

428
00:16:33,899 --> 00:16:37,019
and you see things start going on

429
00:16:37,019 --> 00:16:38,279
then

430
00:16:38,279 --> 00:16:40,680
we have a graph a few more lines the

431
00:16:40,680 --> 00:16:42,000
blue line in the middle is when

432
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:44,279
Volkswagen's block belts came out and

433
00:16:44,279 --> 00:16:45,720
the green line at the end is when they

434
00:16:45,720 --> 00:16:47,880
fillet notifications came out so let's

435
00:16:47,880 --> 00:16:49,560
see how this was adopted in a few

436
00:16:49,560 --> 00:16:50,519
countries

437
00:16:50,519 --> 00:16:52,019
let's start with the adoption here in

438
00:16:52,019 --> 00:16:53,040
the Netherlands

439
00:16:53,040 --> 00:16:55,440
you can clearly see a 10 Trend breaking

440
00:16:55,440 --> 00:16:57,720
and things going down after we've

441
00:16:57,720 --> 00:16:59,100
notified

442
00:16:59,100 --> 00:17:00,240
we can see the same in the United

443
00:17:00,240 --> 00:17:02,639
Kingdom it's already slowly going down

444
00:17:02,639 --> 00:17:04,559
our notifications go out and then

445
00:17:04,559 --> 00:17:06,119
there's an uptick and it goes on

446
00:17:06,119 --> 00:17:08,220
slightly faster

447
00:17:08,220 --> 00:17:10,919
Switzerland did even better they really

448
00:17:10,919 --> 00:17:13,079
like listening to us apparently so thank

449
00:17:13,079 --> 00:17:14,760
you people in search now

450
00:17:14,760 --> 00:17:18,059
and the same can be said for Canada

451
00:17:18,059 --> 00:17:20,939
that's very impressive we thought we

452
00:17:20,939 --> 00:17:22,679
were very happy with these results

453
00:17:22,679 --> 00:17:25,500
of course sadly this does not work

454
00:17:25,500 --> 00:17:29,400
everywhere the French were not as

455
00:17:29,400 --> 00:17:31,380
listening to our notifications as you

456
00:17:31,380 --> 00:17:32,580
can see

457
00:17:32,580 --> 00:17:34,620
but for us this is also a lesson to

458
00:17:34,620 --> 00:17:35,520
learn

459
00:17:35,520 --> 00:17:38,520
so we can now go and look why doesn't

460
00:17:38,520 --> 00:17:41,580
France listen is it because all the

461
00:17:41,580 --> 00:17:44,340
systems are as of Aha and they refuse to

462
00:17:44,340 --> 00:17:46,140
put our notices through to the evidence

463
00:17:46,140 --> 00:17:49,260
of the systems or are the French just

464
00:17:49,260 --> 00:17:51,360
not willing to read any email there's no

465
00:17:51,360 --> 00:17:53,760
scent in French

466
00:17:53,760 --> 00:17:56,220
it could be but that's why we can learn

467
00:17:56,220 --> 00:17:58,799
how we can reach these people better and

468
00:17:58,799 --> 00:18:01,559
yeah how to clean up the internet in an

469
00:18:01,559 --> 00:18:04,320
even more efficient way

470
00:18:04,320 --> 00:18:06,720
I don't know

471
00:18:06,720 --> 00:18:09,299
talking about doing things better

472
00:18:09,299 --> 00:18:11,000
I think it off had a few points about

473
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:13,380
what he believes could actually be done

474
00:18:13,380 --> 00:18:15,120
better yeah so what can we do better

475
00:18:15,120 --> 00:18:17,460
like surely

476
00:18:17,460 --> 00:18:20,700
we can do better as a community so

477
00:18:20,700 --> 00:18:22,860
surely nobody would ever hook up a fee

478
00:18:22,860 --> 00:18:24,600
sphere to the internet I mean why would

479
00:18:24,600 --> 00:18:25,919
you this

480
00:18:25,919 --> 00:18:28,440
what does it adds

481
00:18:28,440 --> 00:18:31,220
yeah exactly

482
00:18:31,460 --> 00:18:35,580
yeah we get to that uh exposed to F5

483
00:18:35,580 --> 00:18:37,020
management interface to the internet

484
00:18:37,020 --> 00:18:39,419
when Chris goes cfes get published like

485
00:18:39,419 --> 00:18:41,760
every two to three months

486
00:18:41,760 --> 00:18:45,240
um Orwell Xbox RDP to the internet

487
00:18:45,240 --> 00:18:45,900
um

488
00:18:45,900 --> 00:18:47,220
or maybe wait two and a half years

489
00:18:47,220 --> 00:18:49,380
before patching we've seen that one we

490
00:18:49,380 --> 00:18:51,059
have to we have the details for that one

491
00:18:51,059 --> 00:18:52,620
actually I think we've certainly seen

492
00:18:52,620 --> 00:18:54,840
all of these ones yeah that's true

493
00:18:54,840 --> 00:18:56,640
actually

494
00:18:56,640 --> 00:18:58,679
um and also maybe you shouldn't build

495
00:18:58,679 --> 00:19:00,480
professional remote access Gateway

496
00:19:00,480 --> 00:19:03,299
products on a BC version that's a not

497
00:19:03,299 --> 00:19:06,179
supported and B use Pro to do everything

498
00:19:06,179 --> 00:19:08,280
with it

499
00:19:08,280 --> 00:19:10,919
um yeah

500
00:19:10,919 --> 00:19:13,260
pretty much this

501
00:19:13,260 --> 00:19:15,539
um so what can we do better

502
00:19:15,539 --> 00:19:18,179
um either allow this us or please don't

503
00:19:18,179 --> 00:19:19,799
block us

504
00:19:19,799 --> 00:19:21,360
um yeah this is the iOS that we're

505
00:19:21,360 --> 00:19:23,039
scanning from so if you want to get

506
00:19:23,039 --> 00:19:24,720

00:19:39,059 --> 00:19:41,340
yeah so yeah

514
00:19:41,340 --> 00:19:43,860
thank you questions discussion or maybe

515
00:19:43,860 --> 00:19:48,080
some awkward silence we can also do that

516
00:19:49,410 --> 00:19:55,440
[Applause]

517
00:19:55,440 --> 00:19:56,820
somebody should ask a question because

518
00:19:56,820 --> 00:20:00,080
it all really wants to throw the thing

519
00:20:02,520 --> 00:20:04,879
all right

520
00:20:04,919 --> 00:20:06,960
please put that IP range back on the

521
00:20:06,960 --> 00:20:09,799
screen yeah sure

522
00:20:11,520 --> 00:20:12,960
it's also on our website it's in the

523
00:20:12,960 --> 00:20:14,760
footer if you go to Dave David now in

524
00:20:14,760 --> 00:20:16,620
the footer you'll see our as

525
00:20:16,620 --> 00:20:19,620
m

526
00:20:21,960 --> 00:20:24,539
so just a question or does anyone have

527
00:20:24,539 --> 00:20:26,039
an idea on

528
00:20:26,039 --> 00:20:30,559
maybe what you think we could do better

529
00:20:31,500 --> 00:20:34,020
Health there

530
00:20:34,020 --> 00:20:37,039
this also be fun

531
00:20:38,280 --> 00:20:41,580
so the question is what is the worst

532
00:20:41,580 --> 00:20:43,740
case doomsday scenario

533
00:20:43,740 --> 00:20:46,580
that you can imagine

534
00:20:47,220 --> 00:20:50,100
um doomsday scenario yeah

535
00:20:50,100 --> 00:20:53,700
uh I think for me that would be

536
00:20:53,700 --> 00:20:55,799
the cassette case

537
00:20:55,799 --> 00:20:58,440
had it been exploited better because at

538
00:20:58,440 --> 00:21:00,720
our initial look we were like

539
00:21:00,720 --> 00:21:03,240
the impact of this could be insane

540
00:21:03,240 --> 00:21:05,340
and then in the end while it was still

541
00:21:05,340 --> 00:21:07,620
very impactful and very big

542
00:21:07,620 --> 00:21:09,720
only 60 direct customers of Cassara

543
00:21:09,720 --> 00:21:10,980
faxes

544
00:21:10,980 --> 00:21:13,559
and that already meant 1500 Downstream

545
00:21:13,559 --> 00:21:14,880
victims

546
00:21:14,880 --> 00:21:16,860
so imagine if they had

547
00:21:16,860 --> 00:21:19,020
prepared a little better

548
00:21:19,020 --> 00:21:21,419
and here's all it's only 300 systems are

549
00:21:21,419 --> 00:21:24,440
on the internet because

550
00:21:24,679 --> 00:21:27,720
that sounds fun no no I think you

551
00:21:27,720 --> 00:21:29,400
misunderstand the question that's like

552
00:21:29,400 --> 00:21:32,340
one company and like not that many users

553
00:21:32,340 --> 00:21:35,460
I think doomsday is more like there's a

554
00:21:35,460 --> 00:21:37,440
lot for Jay but this time in like

555
00:21:37,440 --> 00:21:39,740
repeatables

556
00:21:39,740 --> 00:21:43,760
that's a doomsday divide

557
00:21:45,720 --> 00:21:50,640
I agree that would be worse yeah

558
00:21:50,640 --> 00:21:53,240
hmm

559
00:21:55,760 --> 00:21:59,059
that's enough

560
00:21:59,340 --> 00:22:02,940
so so when you say 1500 victims that's

561
00:22:02,940 --> 00:22:04,980
1500 machines or

562
00:22:04,980 --> 00:22:08,600
1500 companies 1500 companies yes

563
00:22:08,600 --> 00:22:11,700
machines and it's America times 100 or

564
00:22:11,700 --> 00:22:14,220
times a thousand uh potentially yes yeah

565
00:22:14,220 --> 00:22:15,960
that would be yeah

566
00:22:15,960 --> 00:22:18,740
a shame

567
00:22:19,320 --> 00:22:21,419
any more questions

568
00:22:21,419 --> 00:22:23,700
no no I guess we'll stop the talk then

569
00:22:23,700 --> 00:22:24,720
we're done

570
00:22:24,720 --> 00:22:27,559
thank you
