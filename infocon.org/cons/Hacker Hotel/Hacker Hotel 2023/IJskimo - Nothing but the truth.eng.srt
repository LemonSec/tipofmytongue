1
00:00:00,599 --> 00:00:02,660
oh

2
00:00:02,660 --> 00:00:06,540
[Applause]

3
00:00:06,540 --> 00:00:08,519
um this is an entirely different title

4
00:00:08,519 --> 00:00:10,800
than you see on the on the board there

5
00:00:10,800 --> 00:00:14,219
uh it's nothing but the truth but uh

6
00:00:14,219 --> 00:00:16,859
that was a working title I think this is

7
00:00:16,859 --> 00:00:19,199
a lot funnier because you know I think

8
00:00:19,199 --> 00:00:22,020
in images so that's on fire that's quite

9
00:00:22,020 --> 00:00:24,779
funny is there anyone that doesn't know

10
00:00:24,779 --> 00:00:27,539
what what I mean by Pence on fire

11
00:00:27,539 --> 00:00:31,140
it's the the phrase Liar Liar pencil fry

12
00:00:31,140 --> 00:00:34,079
avoid so I'm a social engineer

13
00:00:34,079 --> 00:00:36,660
um this is me I reused the slide from

14
00:00:36,660 --> 00:00:39,719
last year so that was quite easy uh the

15
00:00:39,719 --> 00:00:41,820
only thing that I changed is that um

16
00:00:41,820 --> 00:00:44,160
down here

17
00:00:44,160 --> 00:00:47,040
in in the time of people being woke and

18
00:00:47,040 --> 00:00:51,059
uh you know there is a sexual context

19
00:00:51,059 --> 00:00:53,100
with fathers

20
00:00:53,100 --> 00:00:56,280
and daddy that's also not really good I

21
00:00:56,280 --> 00:00:57,300
was told

22
00:00:57,300 --> 00:00:58,559
so

23
00:00:58,559 --> 00:01:01,920
um yeah I'm a dad and uh that gives you

24
00:01:01,920 --> 00:01:04,319
an entirely New Perspective on social

25
00:01:04,319 --> 00:01:06,600
engineering when you have a little kid

26
00:01:06,600 --> 00:01:09,720
she's five years old now and she's

27
00:01:09,720 --> 00:01:11,580
social Engineers the hell out of her

28
00:01:11,580 --> 00:01:13,860
grandparents

29
00:01:13,860 --> 00:01:17,040
um she tries the same with us but that

30
00:01:17,040 --> 00:01:19,320
she has a to do a bit more training for

31
00:01:19,320 --> 00:01:20,220
that

32
00:01:20,220 --> 00:01:22,380
um but children are very good social

33
00:01:22,380 --> 00:01:24,540
engineers

34
00:01:24,540 --> 00:01:26,280
um I've been working in Social

35
00:01:26,280 --> 00:01:28,320
Engineering for a very long time maybe

36
00:01:28,320 --> 00:01:31,020
20 25 years something I'm feeling really

37
00:01:31,020 --> 00:01:33,780
old if I start to think back how long

38
00:01:33,780 --> 00:01:36,420
this has been for pen testing long time

39
00:01:36,420 --> 00:01:37,619
and

40
00:01:37,619 --> 00:01:38,659
um

41
00:01:38,659 --> 00:01:42,119
more reasons I've been doing more of a

42
00:01:42,119 --> 00:01:45,600
scientific approach studying why because

43
00:01:45,600 --> 00:01:48,900
I got caught all the time because people

44
00:01:48,900 --> 00:01:51,899
recognize your face after pen testing

45
00:01:51,899 --> 00:01:53,820
for a long time and you return to the

46
00:01:53,820 --> 00:01:56,880
same company to do another audit they

47
00:01:56,880 --> 00:01:59,579
see you and say ah look

48
00:01:59,579 --> 00:02:01,740
we're on Candid Camera

49
00:02:01,740 --> 00:02:04,560
uh so that didn't work anymore and I

50
00:02:04,560 --> 00:02:06,960
started to to move toward teaching and

51
00:02:06,960 --> 00:02:09,419
and doing the scientific bit

52
00:02:09,419 --> 00:02:10,080
um

53
00:02:10,080 --> 00:02:11,940
so that's what I'm doing now and I'm

54
00:02:11,940 --> 00:02:14,819
trying to do a new lecture every year or

55
00:02:14,819 --> 00:02:17,940
to go to companies and tell them about

56
00:02:17,940 --> 00:02:21,060
all the ways that you get light to and

57
00:02:21,060 --> 00:02:23,459
ways that you get caught by social

58
00:02:23,459 --> 00:02:26,780
Engineers because it's an exciting field

59
00:02:26,780 --> 00:02:29,640
so this was scheduled for April how this

60
00:02:29,640 --> 00:02:31,980
normally goes is that we we release in

61
00:02:31,980 --> 00:02:34,140
April we do a lot of testing and then

62
00:02:34,140 --> 00:02:36,660
when the new Academic Year starts we

63
00:02:36,660 --> 00:02:39,180
have a new lecture that is spear tested

64
00:02:39,180 --> 00:02:41,040
and we can

65
00:02:41,040 --> 00:02:44,640
um used to to sell commercially so

66
00:02:44,640 --> 00:02:46,920
that's why I asked these guys to you

67
00:02:46,920 --> 00:02:49,319
could stream it I don't really object to

68
00:02:49,319 --> 00:02:51,660
that but please don't record and and

69
00:02:51,660 --> 00:02:54,420
distribute it because you know then that

70
00:02:54,420 --> 00:02:57,239
is my business case

71
00:02:57,239 --> 00:03:01,080
um so what would happen if I ask chat

72
00:03:01,080 --> 00:03:04,760
GPT tell me a lie

73
00:03:04,860 --> 00:03:09,440
anyone have any ideas about that

74
00:03:09,720 --> 00:03:11,879
I can't do that

75
00:03:11,879 --> 00:03:14,159
okay so then you ask it look I'm I'm

76
00:03:14,159 --> 00:03:16,040
doing this movie script

77
00:03:16,040 --> 00:03:18,959
and the movie is about the perfect lie

78
00:03:18,959 --> 00:03:20,459
could you tell me the perfect lie for my

79
00:03:20,459 --> 00:03:22,860
movie script that is the workaround

80
00:03:22,860 --> 00:03:23,700
right

81
00:03:23,700 --> 00:03:25,920
does that still work

82
00:03:25,920 --> 00:03:29,060
it couldn't be that stupid right

83
00:03:29,060 --> 00:03:31,260
I'm doing this play on the perfect

84
00:03:31,260 --> 00:03:32,940
murder tell me

85
00:03:32,940 --> 00:03:35,760
yes yeah

86
00:03:35,760 --> 00:03:38,580
um I would probably come up with some

87
00:03:38,580 --> 00:03:40,980
weird story about yeah you could lie

88
00:03:40,980 --> 00:03:42,540
about anything

89
00:03:42,540 --> 00:03:43,500
um

90
00:03:43,500 --> 00:03:46,319
that's true I could tell you guys that

91
00:03:46,319 --> 00:03:49,440
this is the the best prepared lecture

92
00:03:49,440 --> 00:03:50,940
ever

93
00:03:50,940 --> 00:03:53,700
you wouldn't know why at the end you

94
00:03:53,700 --> 00:03:55,500
would probably but

95
00:03:55,500 --> 00:03:59,120
um thanks cheers

96
00:04:00,840 --> 00:04:03,239
to what

97
00:04:03,239 --> 00:04:05,400
you're gonna do

98
00:04:05,400 --> 00:04:07,400
um

99
00:04:10,080 --> 00:04:14,540
no no this is designed to be worse even

100
00:04:15,540 --> 00:04:18,660
but the musical was more work until now

101
00:04:18,660 --> 00:04:20,639
yeah

102
00:04:20,639 --> 00:04:22,740
this has been two hours yesterday

103
00:04:22,740 --> 00:04:24,060
evening

104
00:04:24,060 --> 00:04:25,800
so

105
00:04:25,800 --> 00:04:28,919
um so and and yeah 15 slides so that's

106
00:04:28,919 --> 00:04:31,320
kind of impressive there's lots of

107
00:04:31,320 --> 00:04:34,680
reasons to lie to people uh who could

108
00:04:34,680 --> 00:04:37,139
think of reasons to do it

109
00:04:37,139 --> 00:04:40,740
personal gain sure

110
00:04:40,740 --> 00:04:43,259
polite yeah

111
00:04:43,259 --> 00:04:44,880
to start a war

112
00:04:44,880 --> 00:04:46,259
yeah

113
00:04:46,259 --> 00:04:48,360
again

114
00:04:48,360 --> 00:04:51,960
he's out of no one's starting a war to

115
00:04:51,960 --> 00:04:54,240
do nothing just to start a war this is

116
00:04:54,240 --> 00:04:57,440
something about gain

117
00:04:57,440 --> 00:04:59,820
no one knows what he wants to gain by

118
00:04:59,820 --> 00:05:02,460
this but he is he probably thinks he's

119
00:05:02,460 --> 00:05:04,800
gaining something

120
00:05:04,800 --> 00:05:08,940
um but yeah to start a war you lie sure

121
00:05:08,940 --> 00:05:11,419
anymore

122
00:05:11,759 --> 00:05:14,100
there's a lot of reasons right

123
00:05:14,100 --> 00:05:17,040
to to protect someone's feelings you

124
00:05:17,040 --> 00:05:17,759
know

125
00:05:17,759 --> 00:05:20,580
no that doesn't make you look fat

126
00:05:20,580 --> 00:05:21,919
um

127
00:05:21,919 --> 00:05:26,759
I think that's probably the the most

128
00:05:26,759 --> 00:05:30,360
to prevent a war that is a bit harder I

129
00:05:30,360 --> 00:05:31,139
think

130
00:05:31,139 --> 00:05:34,740
well um this is just a short list of

131
00:05:34,740 --> 00:05:36,979
reasons that we could have to lie

132
00:05:36,979 --> 00:05:39,000
protecting someone's feelings that

133
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:40,919
that's the little white lie that we

134
00:05:40,919 --> 00:05:43,919
always use uh when someone says this

135
00:05:43,919 --> 00:05:46,919
didn't we make this do I look fat in

136
00:05:46,919 --> 00:05:50,220
this you know or um is this a good

137
00:05:50,220 --> 00:05:52,680
hoodie does it look good yeah you look

138
00:05:52,680 --> 00:05:53,460
great

139
00:05:53,460 --> 00:05:55,080
no worries

140
00:05:55,080 --> 00:05:57,060
um staying out of trouble getting out of

141
00:05:57,060 --> 00:05:59,460
trouble that's a very

142
00:05:59,460 --> 00:06:03,180
good way a good good reason to lie you

143
00:06:03,180 --> 00:06:04,800
know I shouldn't do it in the first

144
00:06:04,800 --> 00:06:06,539
place then probably but if you have to

145
00:06:06,539 --> 00:06:08,880
lie about it to stay out of trouble but

146
00:06:08,880 --> 00:06:11,160
that is quite hard because you get

147
00:06:11,160 --> 00:06:12,360
caught

148
00:06:12,360 --> 00:06:15,000
um a lot of times and later we'll see

149
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:17,400
why and maybe at the end of this talk

150
00:06:17,400 --> 00:06:20,639
he'll have some tools to to

151
00:06:20,639 --> 00:06:24,720
get to the bottom of people lying to you

152
00:06:24,720 --> 00:06:27,960
um what more gaining profit we heard

153
00:06:27,960 --> 00:06:30,539
about that one or um

154
00:06:30,539 --> 00:06:33,180
building or undermining a reputation

155
00:06:33,180 --> 00:06:36,300
we've seen that during covet right

156
00:06:36,300 --> 00:06:39,840
the two two sides of the covet world

157
00:06:39,840 --> 00:06:42,240
that's yeah but this is absolutely true

158
00:06:42,240 --> 00:06:45,300
no no no it's absolutely this and

159
00:06:45,300 --> 00:06:48,840
it was all about reputations

160
00:06:48,840 --> 00:06:52,500
um so there's a lot of reasons but there

161
00:06:52,500 --> 00:06:55,560
is only three ways to lie do you guys

162
00:06:55,560 --> 00:06:58,319
know that three ways if you look at it

163
00:06:58,319 --> 00:07:02,720
in in groups three ways

164
00:07:02,880 --> 00:07:05,220
um if anyone here finds a way that

165
00:07:05,220 --> 00:07:07,979
doesn't fit in these three

166
00:07:07,979 --> 00:07:10,979
send me an email because I'll adjust my

167
00:07:10,979 --> 00:07:13,340
lecture but I think these are the three

168
00:07:13,340 --> 00:07:16,319
ways I'll explain later that if you find

169
00:07:16,319 --> 00:07:17,819
one

170
00:07:17,819 --> 00:07:19,979
that doesn't just affect my presentation

171
00:07:19,979 --> 00:07:23,460
but probably in the entire legal system

172
00:07:23,460 --> 00:07:27,060
so this is this is quite big you could

173
00:07:27,060 --> 00:07:28,979
lie in commission and in commission that

174
00:07:28,979 --> 00:07:31,860
is just the plain blunt lie yeah you

175
00:07:31,860 --> 00:07:34,199
look great

176
00:07:34,199 --> 00:07:37,259
yeah that's not true

177
00:07:37,259 --> 00:07:39,479
period that's it

178
00:07:39,479 --> 00:07:41,819
um you could lie by omission

179
00:07:41,819 --> 00:07:44,880
let's say I went on a business trip and

180
00:07:44,880 --> 00:07:46,740
I have a

181
00:07:46,740 --> 00:07:48,780
a lover there

182
00:07:48,780 --> 00:07:51,419
I'm not telling my wife because I

183
00:07:51,419 --> 00:07:54,300
shouldn't get in trouble right

184
00:07:54,300 --> 00:07:56,639
so I'm on this business trip and she

185
00:07:56,639 --> 00:07:58,979
said okay how was this well well it was

186
00:07:58,979 --> 00:08:00,720
very nice and I went to this meeting in

187
00:08:00,720 --> 00:08:02,340
this meeting and went for some dinner

188
00:08:02,340 --> 00:08:04,380
and I went this and I'll just leave all

189
00:08:04,380 --> 00:08:06,960
the naughty bits out that's Lying by

190
00:08:06,960 --> 00:08:08,520
omission

191
00:08:08,520 --> 00:08:11,479
so you're just not telling everything

192
00:08:11,479 --> 00:08:14,400
and lying by influence and that is a

193
00:08:14,400 --> 00:08:16,380
very tricky but that is

194
00:08:16,380 --> 00:08:19,020
that's very tricky because you don't

195
00:08:19,020 --> 00:08:21,539
really really lie

196
00:08:21,539 --> 00:08:25,220
but you get people to jump to to

197
00:08:25,220 --> 00:08:28,400
conclusions live for you

198
00:08:28,400 --> 00:08:31,919
in one of my previous talks I I talked

199
00:08:31,919 --> 00:08:33,479
about this guy

200
00:08:33,479 --> 00:08:35,760
um that moved from Maastricht in the

201
00:08:35,760 --> 00:08:38,339
Netherlands to Amsterdam any of you

202
00:08:38,339 --> 00:08:40,620
heard that story

203
00:08:40,620 --> 00:08:42,899
if not I'll I'll repeat it here this guy

204
00:08:42,899 --> 00:08:46,140
he was in uh Emma Street

205
00:08:46,140 --> 00:08:47,220
um

206
00:08:47,220 --> 00:08:49,560
but originally from Amsterdam he moved

207
00:08:49,560 --> 00:08:52,320
there for a lady and his relationship

208
00:08:52,320 --> 00:08:54,120
went South

209
00:08:54,120 --> 00:08:56,100
so

210
00:08:56,100 --> 00:08:58,080
he wanted to move back to Amsterdam but

211
00:08:58,080 --> 00:08:59,820
it was a problem he had his job over

212
00:08:59,820 --> 00:09:00,779
there

213
00:09:00,779 --> 00:09:03,779
and he had a house over there they were

214
00:09:03,779 --> 00:09:05,640
still living together so we wanted to

215
00:09:05,640 --> 00:09:08,100
move back but what did you do

216
00:09:08,100 --> 00:09:10,500
you get there you you go to Amsterdam

217
00:09:10,500 --> 00:09:12,240
you get a house but you have your job

218
00:09:12,240 --> 00:09:14,040
there so you have to commute all the

219
00:09:14,040 --> 00:09:14,760
time

220
00:09:14,760 --> 00:09:16,740
you could also search for a job in

221
00:09:16,740 --> 00:09:18,839
Amsterdam but still not have a house so

222
00:09:18,839 --> 00:09:20,640
you have to commute

223
00:09:20,640 --> 00:09:23,519
whatever you do there is a commute for a

224
00:09:23,519 --> 00:09:24,959
certain time

225
00:09:24,959 --> 00:09:27,480
so what he did he bought this uh yellow

226
00:09:27,480 --> 00:09:28,560
jacket

227
00:09:28,560 --> 00:09:31,680
and he went to the railway station and

228
00:09:31,680 --> 00:09:33,480
um I don't know you you do you know

229
00:09:33,480 --> 00:09:37,140
these diamond shaped little plates the

230
00:09:37,140 --> 00:09:39,899
place between the tracks with a three or

231
00:09:39,899 --> 00:09:42,420
a four the little blue diamond shaped

232
00:09:42,420 --> 00:09:45,360
signs ever seen them you know what they

233
00:09:45,360 --> 00:09:47,540
are

234
00:09:47,580 --> 00:09:49,080
they tell you

235
00:09:49,080 --> 00:09:51,240
you should drive up to here when you

236
00:09:51,240 --> 00:09:53,640
have this many wagons

237
00:09:53,640 --> 00:09:55,680
because you never know that the length

238
00:09:55,680 --> 00:09:57,779
of a train and you have you don't have

239
00:09:57,779 --> 00:10:00,420
mirrors or anything so you you have to

240
00:10:00,420 --> 00:10:03,240
see something oh I have four wagons so I

241
00:10:03,240 --> 00:10:06,180
have to go all the way over here to make

242
00:10:06,180 --> 00:10:08,940
sure that I'm fully in the station

243
00:10:08,940 --> 00:10:11,100
if you're not opening your doors will be

244
00:10:11,100 --> 00:10:13,019
hilarious

245
00:10:13,019 --> 00:10:13,800
um

246
00:10:13,800 --> 00:10:18,000
so um he he went to the the correct

247
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:20,040
number and he stood there and this this

248
00:10:20,040 --> 00:10:22,440
train comes in and sure enough this guy

249
00:10:22,440 --> 00:10:25,019
comes out and he's right there and he

250
00:10:25,019 --> 00:10:26,100
says hey

251
00:10:26,100 --> 00:10:28,440
you were doing Amsterdam yeah I'm doing

252
00:10:28,440 --> 00:10:30,959
Amsterdam all right and look I'm I'm

253
00:10:30,959 --> 00:10:32,880
just learning all these things and do

254
00:10:32,880 --> 00:10:35,580
you mind if I tag along well no no no

255
00:10:35,580 --> 00:10:37,860
problem so this guy thought he was

256
00:10:37,860 --> 00:10:39,959
talking to a colleague maybe an intern

257
00:10:39,959 --> 00:10:42,899
maybe a new guy he said well I just come

258
00:10:42,899 --> 00:10:45,180
along sit in the front I'll tell you

259
00:10:45,180 --> 00:10:47,519
everything well I'll show you around

260
00:10:47,519 --> 00:10:49,920
and we'll drive some sermon he had a

261
00:10:49,920 --> 00:10:51,060
good time and they were talking about

262
00:10:51,060 --> 00:10:53,339
all the things so you can imagine that

263
00:10:53,339 --> 00:10:56,040
if he does that all day every day

264
00:10:56,040 --> 00:10:58,560
on the way there on the way back that he

265
00:10:58,560 --> 00:11:00,959
learns a lot about trains

266
00:11:00,959 --> 00:11:02,820
so his story became stronger and

267
00:11:02,820 --> 00:11:06,000
stronger but he never ever told anyone

268
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:09,000
that he was an actual railroad employee

269
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:11,940
he didn't he just well you know I'm

270
00:11:11,940 --> 00:11:13,860
learning about these trains and I think

271
00:11:13,860 --> 00:11:17,459
that's fantastic and yo could I could I

272
00:11:17,459 --> 00:11:22,459
come along so they invited him to do

273
00:11:23,279 --> 00:11:25,980
um after a while he got in trouble for

274
00:11:25,980 --> 00:11:28,500
something entirely different and so

275
00:11:28,500 --> 00:11:31,320
the entire story came out and they

276
00:11:31,320 --> 00:11:33,180
confronted him with this and even wanted

277
00:11:33,180 --> 00:11:36,260
to charge him with it like you've been

278
00:11:36,260 --> 00:11:39,540
riding this train without pay and come

279
00:11:39,540 --> 00:11:41,459
on what what are you doing you have to

280
00:11:41,459 --> 00:11:43,740
you know here are all the fines from the

281
00:11:43,740 --> 00:11:46,500
last year and it was a lot of trouble he

282
00:11:46,500 --> 00:11:49,019
said well okay but

283
00:11:49,019 --> 00:11:52,560
I got invited to to just tag along I

284
00:11:52,560 --> 00:11:55,380
didn't go there for you know and I

285
00:11:55,380 --> 00:11:57,600
didn't occupy a seat I was in the front

286
00:11:57,600 --> 00:12:00,180
there and talking to the drivers I think

287
00:12:00,180 --> 00:12:02,399
what's the problem yeah the trouble is

288
00:12:02,399 --> 00:12:04,440
that you were

289
00:12:04,440 --> 00:12:07,260
um impersonating a railway Railway

290
00:12:07,260 --> 00:12:11,160
employee he says oh why is that because

291
00:12:11,160 --> 00:12:13,980
I I don't think I ever did

292
00:12:13,980 --> 00:12:16,560
and he won this case

293
00:12:16,560 --> 00:12:19,440
he won so this is a lie of influence he

294
00:12:19,440 --> 00:12:21,899
didn't lie at any point in time but

295
00:12:21,899 --> 00:12:23,640
people just

296
00:12:23,640 --> 00:12:26,040
I've seen this a lot of times when I do

297
00:12:26,040 --> 00:12:28,380
a pen test social engineering pain test

298
00:12:28,380 --> 00:12:31,380
and I get myself in a building

299
00:12:31,380 --> 00:12:33,540
and sometimes I just sit there with my

300
00:12:33,540 --> 00:12:34,920
laptop

301
00:12:34,920 --> 00:12:36,839
and

302
00:12:36,839 --> 00:12:39,060
I've been keeping track as this years

303
00:12:39,060 --> 00:12:41,100
ago so I don't really have the the exact

304
00:12:41,100 --> 00:12:44,220
number but I think it has been weeks

305
00:12:44,220 --> 00:12:46,380
my personal record is being there for

306
00:12:46,380 --> 00:12:47,519
weeks

307
00:12:47,519 --> 00:12:50,000
in one of those you know the the

308
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:52,200
workplaces where you have these islands

309
00:12:52,200 --> 00:12:54,839
where you can just sit down and oh yeah

310
00:12:54,839 --> 00:12:57,899
okay you know there's not there's no

311
00:12:57,899 --> 00:13:00,360
personal offices there's just a space

312
00:13:00,360 --> 00:13:04,079
which is very noisy and very I hate

313
00:13:04,079 --> 00:13:06,839
those things but I've been there for

314
00:13:06,839 --> 00:13:09,420
weeks Sometimes some pandas have been

315
00:13:09,420 --> 00:13:11,220
there for weeks and no one asked me what

316
00:13:11,220 --> 00:13:13,680
I was doing there or who I was or I was

317
00:13:13,680 --> 00:13:15,060
just sitting there with my laptop

318
00:13:15,060 --> 00:13:17,399
writing my report on pen test of course

319
00:13:17,399 --> 00:13:20,040
because you have to do your work

320
00:13:20,040 --> 00:13:21,240
um

321
00:13:21,240 --> 00:13:24,240
no one they just assumed

322
00:13:24,240 --> 00:13:27,839
this is lying the LIE of influence

323
00:13:27,839 --> 00:13:30,200
because if someone would have asked me

324
00:13:30,200 --> 00:13:32,700
who are you what are you doing here I

325
00:13:32,700 --> 00:13:34,740
probably would have come up with a story

326
00:13:34,740 --> 00:13:36,540
and that would have been one of the

327
00:13:36,540 --> 00:13:38,880
other two categories but

328
00:13:38,880 --> 00:13:41,040
people just assume

329
00:13:41,040 --> 00:13:43,260
and it's a very dangerous thing so if

330
00:13:43,260 --> 00:13:45,600
you are a social engineer you want to

331
00:13:45,600 --> 00:13:47,639
you do the perfect lie

332
00:13:47,639 --> 00:13:51,600
try this last this last category

333
00:13:51,600 --> 00:13:52,860
so

334
00:13:52,860 --> 00:13:55,920
we'll watch TV don't we

335
00:13:55,920 --> 00:13:57,540
some of us don't

336
00:13:57,540 --> 00:14:01,200
it's very wise read a book it's better

337
00:14:01,200 --> 00:14:04,139
um but if you look at any courtroom

338
00:14:04,139 --> 00:14:07,920
drama this is what what they do

339
00:14:07,920 --> 00:14:10,500
there is an oath or an affirmation or a

340
00:14:10,500 --> 00:14:12,060
promise uh

341
00:14:12,060 --> 00:14:13,920
depending on who you are if your

342
00:14:13,920 --> 00:14:17,639
religion you you do an oath if you're

343
00:14:17,639 --> 00:14:19,320
not religious you could do an

344
00:14:19,320 --> 00:14:21,959
affirmation or a promise but basically

345
00:14:21,959 --> 00:14:23,579
they're all the same thing

346
00:14:23,579 --> 00:14:26,700
you've promised the judge that you will

347
00:14:26,700 --> 00:14:29,339
adhere to their rules and do a certain

348
00:14:29,339 --> 00:14:31,200
thing or or don't

349
00:14:31,200 --> 00:14:34,320
and what's what uh is the testimony that

350
00:14:34,320 --> 00:14:35,880
you swear to

351
00:14:35,880 --> 00:14:38,820
I solemnly swear I'm up to no good

352
00:14:38,820 --> 00:14:40,519
that's also a

353
00:14:40,519 --> 00:14:43,620
sworn statement by the way

354
00:14:43,620 --> 00:14:44,940
um

355
00:14:44,940 --> 00:14:47,279
I swear this is from Wikipedia so I

356
00:14:47,279 --> 00:14:50,880
think it's correct I swear by fill in

357
00:14:50,880 --> 00:14:53,660
your favorite God here or

358
00:14:53,660 --> 00:14:57,360
uh that I will tell the truth the whole

359
00:14:57,360 --> 00:14:59,880
truth and nothing but the truth

360
00:14:59,880 --> 00:15:03,600
so if we go back to our three categories

361
00:15:03,600 --> 00:15:06,540
this is a brilliant affirmation

362
00:15:06,540 --> 00:15:08,699
this is very good because it covers

363
00:15:08,699 --> 00:15:10,920
everything

364
00:15:10,920 --> 00:15:13,199
you swear to tell the truth so no lies

365
00:15:13,199 --> 00:15:15,300
in commission

366
00:15:15,300 --> 00:15:18,959
the whole truths are no lies of omission

367
00:15:18,959 --> 00:15:21,660
and nothing but the truth no

368
00:15:21,660 --> 00:15:24,720
around so people just assume

369
00:15:24,720 --> 00:15:27,240
this is pretty strong

370
00:15:27,240 --> 00:15:28,560
and

371
00:15:28,560 --> 00:15:31,199
before I start looking into this I I

372
00:15:31,199 --> 00:15:32,880
never you know

373
00:15:32,880 --> 00:15:35,579
realized how brilliant that affirmation

374
00:15:35,579 --> 00:15:37,380
actually is

375
00:15:37,380 --> 00:15:41,220
so uh these three kinds of Lies

376
00:15:41,220 --> 00:15:44,279
that's what you should look at when you

377
00:15:44,279 --> 00:15:48,540
when you want to battle Liars or

378
00:15:48,540 --> 00:15:50,339
unmask them

379
00:15:50,339 --> 00:15:52,079
it's also what you should look at when

380
00:15:52,079 --> 00:15:54,060
you want to be a better liar

381
00:15:54,060 --> 00:15:56,399
because all the things that you see here

382
00:15:56,399 --> 00:15:58,740
you could use it for good and for bad

383
00:15:58,740 --> 00:16:01,500
and that's what these events are all

384
00:16:01,500 --> 00:16:02,880
about right

385
00:16:02,880 --> 00:16:05,160
but every talk you hear I think you

386
00:16:05,160 --> 00:16:07,800
could use it for good or bad

387
00:16:07,800 --> 00:16:10,139
so um

388
00:16:10,139 --> 00:16:12,959
I listed them here if you dissect this

389
00:16:12,959 --> 00:16:14,940
affirmation there is these three

390
00:16:14,940 --> 00:16:17,339
statements you tell the truth the whole

391
00:16:17,339 --> 00:16:20,959
truth and nothing but the truth

392
00:16:22,320 --> 00:16:23,639
Dan

393
00:16:23,639 --> 00:16:24,720
um

394
00:16:24,720 --> 00:16:26,880
in my current job

395
00:16:26,880 --> 00:16:30,839
um I'm I went to the other side so where

396
00:16:30,839 --> 00:16:33,060
as a pen tester I had to do all the

397
00:16:33,060 --> 00:16:36,240
lying and and scheming and getting

398
00:16:36,240 --> 00:16:38,519
myself in a building and walking around

399
00:16:38,519 --> 00:16:41,519
there and doing all kinds of nasty now

400
00:16:41,519 --> 00:16:43,380
I'm trying to

401
00:16:43,380 --> 00:16:47,579
get to the bottom of people lying to us

402
00:16:47,579 --> 00:16:51,079
and that starts with guys with silk ties

403
00:16:51,079 --> 00:16:53,339
telling us that they have dissolution

404
00:16:53,339 --> 00:16:55,620
for all the problems

405
00:16:55,620 --> 00:17:00,180
for only 400 400k or whatever you all

406
00:17:00,180 --> 00:17:02,100
know those guys probably

407
00:17:02,100 --> 00:17:03,959
they come to your company and say well I

408
00:17:03,959 --> 00:17:05,699
have this perfect solution for you look

409
00:17:05,699 --> 00:17:09,119
I have this very shiny brochure and it

410
00:17:09,119 --> 00:17:11,040
does this and it does this and does this

411
00:17:11,040 --> 00:17:13,679
and when you ask them does it actually

412
00:17:13,679 --> 00:17:15,599
solve our problem

413
00:17:15,599 --> 00:17:18,959
they say yeah well um yes of course

414
00:17:18,959 --> 00:17:22,980
that's a lie of commission right

415
00:17:22,980 --> 00:17:25,439
because they they can't know that that's

416
00:17:25,439 --> 00:17:27,419
just

417
00:17:27,419 --> 00:17:28,380
um

418
00:17:28,380 --> 00:17:31,320
in a previous lecture I I told this

419
00:17:31,320 --> 00:17:34,200
before I have two ways of

420
00:17:34,200 --> 00:17:35,039
um

421
00:17:35,039 --> 00:17:37,799
getting guys like that out of their

422
00:17:37,799 --> 00:17:39,960
comfort zone

423
00:17:39,960 --> 00:17:42,360
and that's the marker the marker methods

424
00:17:42,360 --> 00:17:45,179
and the cup methods and if you heard

425
00:17:45,179 --> 00:17:46,740
those before

426
00:17:46,740 --> 00:17:48,900
because you should try them at work it's

427
00:17:48,900 --> 00:17:49,919
fun

428
00:17:49,919 --> 00:17:52,080
the marker methods there's there's two

429
00:17:52,080 --> 00:17:53,640
types of meeting there's the type of

430
00:17:53,640 --> 00:17:55,559
meeting where I can interfere the

431
00:17:55,559 --> 00:17:58,500
meeting so I have a permission from the

432
00:17:58,500 --> 00:18:00,299
guy invited me there

433
00:18:00,299 --> 00:18:02,700
to to actually interfere

434
00:18:02,700 --> 00:18:03,360
um

435
00:18:03,360 --> 00:18:06,840
and I can try to question the the guy

436
00:18:06,840 --> 00:18:08,760
that comes with his presentation so I

437
00:18:08,760 --> 00:18:10,200
can actually

438
00:18:10,200 --> 00:18:12,419
be part of the conversation and there is

439
00:18:12,419 --> 00:18:15,179
the the type of meeting where I can't

440
00:18:15,179 --> 00:18:17,100
so I have to just sit there in the back

441
00:18:17,100 --> 00:18:20,059
and shut up and I'll have to you know

442
00:18:20,059 --> 00:18:22,980
afterwards report on what I heard and

443
00:18:22,980 --> 00:18:25,880
why I think about it or I have to

444
00:18:25,880 --> 00:18:30,179
find a way to talk to my

445
00:18:30,179 --> 00:18:33,080
um bars in that case bus

446
00:18:33,080 --> 00:18:35,520
about what I think

447
00:18:35,520 --> 00:18:37,620
so the first the first is the easiest

448
00:18:37,620 --> 00:18:39,480
that's the marker method when someone

449
00:18:39,480 --> 00:18:41,460
comes into our office and says okay I

450
00:18:41,460 --> 00:18:43,500
have the solution to your problem

451
00:18:43,500 --> 00:18:45,960
uh mostly I I stand up and give him a

452
00:18:45,960 --> 00:18:47,820
marker a whiteboard Parker and say okay

453
00:18:47,820 --> 00:18:49,799
look

454
00:18:49,799 --> 00:18:51,840
um I'm not aware of the problem

455
00:18:51,840 --> 00:18:54,120
so just to be on the same page where

456
00:18:54,120 --> 00:18:58,080
everyone here could you just tell us

457
00:18:58,080 --> 00:19:00,678
about the problem

458
00:19:01,340 --> 00:19:04,320
that's hilarious because they can't

459
00:19:04,320 --> 00:19:07,620
probably can't if they can they did

460
00:19:07,620 --> 00:19:10,559
their own work that's fantastic and you

461
00:19:10,559 --> 00:19:12,120
have an entirely different conversation

462
00:19:12,120 --> 00:19:14,100
after that but most of them most of the

463
00:19:14,100 --> 00:19:15,179
time they can't

464
00:19:15,179 --> 00:19:17,580
and I've even seen guys getting really

465
00:19:17,580 --> 00:19:19,620
really upset with me because I kept

466
00:19:19,620 --> 00:19:21,840
asking him to to draw the problem for me

467
00:19:21,840 --> 00:19:24,918
because I don't understand

468
00:19:25,320 --> 00:19:28,020
um so this this is a trick you could try

469
00:19:28,020 --> 00:19:30,120
when you go to a meeting and you have

470
00:19:30,120 --> 00:19:31,740
permission to interfere carry a

471
00:19:31,740 --> 00:19:33,120
whiteboard marker

472
00:19:33,120 --> 00:19:35,940
and ask him to to just draw the problem

473
00:19:35,940 --> 00:19:37,980
for you and after that you can talk

474
00:19:37,980 --> 00:19:40,320
about their solution

475
00:19:40,320 --> 00:19:40,980
um

476
00:19:40,980 --> 00:19:42,900
the cup method that's a little more

477
00:19:42,900 --> 00:19:43,980
subtle

478
00:19:43,980 --> 00:19:45,419
um you know that if you're a social

479
00:19:45,419 --> 00:19:47,400
engineer you get all kinds of hobbies

480
00:19:47,400 --> 00:19:49,559
that are related to social engineering

481
00:19:49,559 --> 00:19:53,520
so my wife and I we we do magic shows

482
00:19:53,520 --> 00:19:56,400
and in Magic there is a certain type of

483
00:19:56,400 --> 00:19:58,020
trick where you signal each other

484
00:19:58,020 --> 00:20:01,140
because you have an accomplice somewhere

485
00:20:01,140 --> 00:20:03,240
and one of the ways is you have this

486
00:20:03,240 --> 00:20:05,039
this cup you just drink

487
00:20:05,039 --> 00:20:06,960
bottle

488
00:20:06,960 --> 00:20:09,780
and you place it in a certain way to

489
00:20:09,780 --> 00:20:11,820
single the other

490
00:20:11,820 --> 00:20:14,580
so you can do mind reading x you know

491
00:20:14,580 --> 00:20:17,039
like when I put my bottle over here I've

492
00:20:17,039 --> 00:20:20,220
seen him pick that card so you can

493
00:20:20,220 --> 00:20:23,039
accurately say what he did even when you

494
00:20:23,039 --> 00:20:24,539
left the room and you get back you look

495
00:20:24,539 --> 00:20:27,480
at the bottle you know what I'm telling

496
00:20:27,480 --> 00:20:28,679
you

497
00:20:28,679 --> 00:20:32,400
so this is what I do when my boss tells

498
00:20:32,400 --> 00:20:36,360
me that I should just sit back and don't

499
00:20:36,360 --> 00:20:39,620
shake up too much of the the meeting

500
00:20:39,620 --> 00:20:42,539
I'll just have my cup of coffee and I

501
00:20:42,539 --> 00:20:43,919
put it on the table

502
00:20:43,919 --> 00:20:47,760
and after every sip I place it back on a

503
00:20:47,760 --> 00:20:50,640
position where I think the talk is going

504
00:20:50,640 --> 00:20:53,700
and the rule is the closer I am to the

505
00:20:53,700 --> 00:20:56,160
edge of the table the more it

506
00:20:56,160 --> 00:20:56,880
is

507
00:20:56,880 --> 00:20:59,220
so this isn't this is a very efficient

508
00:20:59,220 --> 00:21:01,380
 meter

509
00:21:01,380 --> 00:21:03,660
if I take a sip and I put my cup in the

510
00:21:03,660 --> 00:21:07,200
middle of the table or well away from me

511
00:21:07,200 --> 00:21:10,620
everything is fine if I put it back

512
00:21:10,620 --> 00:21:12,780
pretty close to me

513
00:21:12,780 --> 00:21:15,360
there is reason for concern

514
00:21:15,360 --> 00:21:18,539
if I start balancing it on the edge you

515
00:21:18,539 --> 00:21:20,640
should stop the meeting right there

516
00:21:20,640 --> 00:21:25,280
I guess it is absolute and

517
00:21:26,220 --> 00:21:28,280
I'm not sure probably

518
00:21:28,280 --> 00:21:32,240
I'm waiting for for something and uh

519
00:21:32,240 --> 00:21:36,179
okay and there there have been

520
00:21:36,179 --> 00:21:36,900
um

521
00:21:36,900 --> 00:21:38,400
meetings

522
00:21:38,400 --> 00:21:42,080
where I just dropped it off the table

523
00:21:43,020 --> 00:21:46,020
and a good bus uh recognizes their

524
00:21:46,020 --> 00:21:47,820
senses okay I think it's time for a

525
00:21:47,820 --> 00:21:48,900
break

526
00:21:48,900 --> 00:21:51,360
and then you talk about what you've seen

527
00:21:51,360 --> 00:21:52,860
and what you've heard and you say okay

528
00:21:52,860 --> 00:21:55,380
this guy is totally full of because

529
00:21:55,380 --> 00:21:57,360
I've seen this marker and this marker

530
00:21:57,360 --> 00:21:58,980
and this indicator and this you know

531
00:21:58,980 --> 00:22:01,200
there's all kinds of

532
00:22:01,200 --> 00:22:03,659
um deceptive indicators as we call them

533
00:22:03,659 --> 00:22:06,840
and I have a whole slew of them so you

534
00:22:06,840 --> 00:22:08,640
should really look in this into this

535
00:22:08,640 --> 00:22:09,960
more carefully

536
00:22:09,960 --> 00:22:12,120
so these are little techniques that you

537
00:22:12,120 --> 00:22:16,280
can do and play around with

538
00:22:16,380 --> 00:22:19,559
stimulus what I mean by that is that

539
00:22:19,559 --> 00:22:22,919
mostly it has a form of a question

540
00:22:22,919 --> 00:22:25,919
and what you what you don't want to do

541
00:22:25,919 --> 00:22:29,340
it was the next slide actually

542
00:22:29,340 --> 00:22:30,720
um

543
00:22:30,720 --> 00:22:32,760
when you when you produce a stimulus

544
00:22:32,760 --> 00:22:34,559
people will respond

545
00:22:34,559 --> 00:22:36,720
and they will respond in one of two ways

546
00:22:36,720 --> 00:22:40,760
it's verbally or officially

547
00:22:40,980 --> 00:22:43,400
um so you have to when you when you

548
00:22:43,400 --> 00:22:45,720
confront them with the stimulus when you

549
00:22:45,720 --> 00:22:48,120
ask a question and these are questions

550
00:22:48,120 --> 00:22:49,740
you can really think about we'll look at

551
00:22:49,740 --> 00:22:52,080
them later

552
00:22:52,080 --> 00:22:55,320
in the first five maybe ten seconds what

553
00:22:55,320 --> 00:22:59,780
you can see and hear tells you the truth

554
00:23:01,080 --> 00:23:04,380
don't drink from the firehouse

555
00:23:04,380 --> 00:23:07,980
because there are books by Jonah Farrow

556
00:23:07,980 --> 00:23:11,220
you know Jonah Farrow former FBI agent

557
00:23:11,220 --> 00:23:13,620
looking at body language he's like the

558
00:23:13,620 --> 00:23:15,240
guy from TV

559
00:23:15,240 --> 00:23:17,760
oh I can see you're lying because I saw

560
00:23:17,760 --> 00:23:19,740
this little hair here on the side of her

561
00:23:19,740 --> 00:23:22,620
that twitched for just a tenth of a

562
00:23:22,620 --> 00:23:23,580
second

563
00:23:23,580 --> 00:23:25,020


564
00:23:25,020 --> 00:23:27,419
this is not what you're looking for

565
00:23:27,419 --> 00:23:29,340
and by the way if you wanted to look at

566
00:23:29,340 --> 00:23:32,760
a body language in general there is a

567
00:23:32,760 --> 00:23:34,620
lot of information

568
00:23:34,620 --> 00:23:36,419
so I mean by down drink from the

569
00:23:36,419 --> 00:23:38,039
firehouse you know these these

570
00:23:38,039 --> 00:23:39,919
high-powered fire houses where they

571
00:23:39,919 --> 00:23:43,440
where they can brush fires up to 10

572
00:23:43,440 --> 00:23:46,020
floors High there is a lot of pressure

573
00:23:46,020 --> 00:23:49,220
on those things they blow off your face

574
00:23:49,220 --> 00:23:51,900
don't drink from those

575
00:23:51,900 --> 00:23:54,840
that is too much information

576
00:23:54,840 --> 00:23:55,679
um

577
00:23:55,679 --> 00:23:59,039
you have to try and and determine what

578
00:23:59,039 --> 00:24:01,559
information at what point is for is

579
00:24:01,559 --> 00:24:04,260
interesting for you so these are the

580
00:24:04,260 --> 00:24:05,640
visual Clues

581
00:24:05,640 --> 00:24:07,559
and a verbal Clues

582
00:24:07,559 --> 00:24:12,120
directly following your stimulus

583
00:24:12,120 --> 00:24:12,780
um

584
00:24:12,780 --> 00:24:16,260
you should also ignore the obvious

585
00:24:16,260 --> 00:24:19,919
so fishable Clues moving anchor points

586
00:24:19,919 --> 00:24:23,100
and anchor points are the the points of

587
00:24:23,100 --> 00:24:26,820
your body that you used to rest on

588
00:24:26,820 --> 00:24:29,340
so my feet are at this point anchor

589
00:24:29,340 --> 00:24:32,220
points I mean of course I'm standing on

590
00:24:32,220 --> 00:24:33,960
my feet but if you're sitting on a chair

591
00:24:33,960 --> 00:24:37,020
your anchor points might shift

592
00:24:37,020 --> 00:24:40,260
there's a scripts from the musical here

593
00:24:40,260 --> 00:24:42,720
use it in souvenir

594
00:24:42,720 --> 00:24:44,700
um so if I sit like this

595
00:24:44,700 --> 00:24:47,640
my anchor points of course is my ass

596
00:24:47,640 --> 00:24:49,919
but it could also still be my feet and

597
00:24:49,919 --> 00:24:51,659
some people sit like this

598
00:24:51,659 --> 00:24:54,179
so these are new anchor points

599
00:24:54,179 --> 00:24:56,960
when you have

600
00:24:58,080 --> 00:25:00,080
um

601
00:25:00,299 --> 00:25:02,220
yeah I'm sitting on a chair trying to to

602
00:25:02,220 --> 00:25:04,820
lean forward

603
00:25:06,020 --> 00:25:09,299
it's it's it's basically I'm showing

604
00:25:09,299 --> 00:25:11,640
anchor points where I

605
00:25:11,640 --> 00:25:12,480
um

606
00:25:12,480 --> 00:25:15,960
uh I rest my buddy so uh when you're

607
00:25:15,960 --> 00:25:18,720
sitting of course it's your butt cheeks

608
00:25:18,720 --> 00:25:21,059
you you have your back against the the

609
00:25:21,059 --> 00:25:24,360
seat or or you can lean forward and and

610
00:25:24,360 --> 00:25:27,120
have your hands on your knees uh these

611
00:25:27,120 --> 00:25:28,799
are the anchor points

612
00:25:28,799 --> 00:25:31,380
basically it's it's points that if you

613
00:25:31,380 --> 00:25:33,720
suddenly take them away you would you

614
00:25:33,720 --> 00:25:34,679
would move

615
00:25:34,679 --> 00:25:36,720
if you see a shift in Anchor points

616
00:25:36,720 --> 00:25:38,760
directly after a stimulus

617
00:25:38,760 --> 00:25:42,320
people doing this or or this or

618
00:25:42,320 --> 00:25:46,279
these are nerfest moves

619
00:25:46,799 --> 00:25:50,100
a thing you should know about clues in

620
00:25:50,100 --> 00:25:52,440
general is that they don't come by

621
00:25:52,440 --> 00:25:55,320
themselves they're always clusters the

622
00:25:55,320 --> 00:25:56,520
word Bank

623
00:25:56,520 --> 00:25:58,380
unfortunately this is the same in

624
00:25:58,380 --> 00:26:01,919
English as um well um if I would say

625
00:26:01,919 --> 00:26:04,620
Bank how many of you would think about a

626
00:26:04,620 --> 00:26:07,699
financial institution

627
00:26:07,860 --> 00:26:09,960
a lot of people but how many of you

628
00:26:09,960 --> 00:26:12,539
would think about a sofa which you can

629
00:26:12,539 --> 00:26:15,000
sit and do a few of them so the word

630
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:18,360
bank by itself

631
00:26:18,360 --> 00:26:20,100
doesn't give me too much information

632
00:26:20,100 --> 00:26:23,460
right it could be a selfie

633
00:26:23,460 --> 00:26:26,039
if I say I'm going to the bank

634
00:26:26,039 --> 00:26:27,480
um yeah it's a little more information

635
00:26:27,480 --> 00:26:30,779
because you you wouldn't tell people

636
00:26:30,779 --> 00:26:33,240
that way if you go sit on the sofa it

637
00:26:33,240 --> 00:26:35,460
would be a bit autistic yeah I'm going

638
00:26:35,460 --> 00:26:37,200
to the bank now

639
00:26:37,200 --> 00:26:38,820
walking over there

640
00:26:38,820 --> 00:26:41,039
taking a seat

641
00:26:41,039 --> 00:26:43,679
yeah probably you mean going to the

642
00:26:43,679 --> 00:26:45,600
financial institution to to get some

643
00:26:45,600 --> 00:26:48,960
money but still not really sure

644
00:26:48,960 --> 00:26:51,360
so you you need more

645
00:26:51,360 --> 00:26:54,059
I'm going to do a withdrawal at the bank

646
00:26:54,059 --> 00:26:56,039
this afternoon you know this this is

647
00:26:56,039 --> 00:26:57,720
quite clear

648
00:26:57,720 --> 00:27:00,240
the same goes for cues

649
00:27:00,240 --> 00:27:00,960
um

650
00:27:00,960 --> 00:27:03,720
there is this very famous Story by Jonah

651
00:27:03,720 --> 00:27:05,159
Farrell his Liars always scratched their

652
00:27:05,159 --> 00:27:06,659
nose

653
00:27:06,659 --> 00:27:09,059
for me this is a thing that I always do

654
00:27:09,059 --> 00:27:10,860
because I have these little hairs here

655
00:27:10,860 --> 00:27:13,380
and they itch and then sometimes I I

656
00:27:13,380 --> 00:27:17,100
have hay fever a lot of you know a lot

657
00:27:17,100 --> 00:27:19,380
of monasteries that some you know so I'm

658
00:27:19,380 --> 00:27:21,900
always doing this that doesn't mean I'm

659
00:27:21,900 --> 00:27:23,460
always lying

660
00:27:23,460 --> 00:27:26,940
this well no so this is this is not an

661
00:27:26,940 --> 00:27:29,640
indicator for me it's not

662
00:27:29,640 --> 00:27:32,299
um shifting anchor points and doing this

663
00:27:32,299 --> 00:27:36,679
and doing some verbal cues and and and

664
00:27:36,679 --> 00:27:41,159
so it all together gives you a clearer

665
00:27:41,159 --> 00:27:42,480
picture

666
00:27:42,480 --> 00:27:45,120
that there may be something going on

667
00:27:45,120 --> 00:27:48,240
so moving anchor points flushing uh when

668
00:27:48,240 --> 00:27:51,600
you lie you get anxious and that means

669
00:27:51,600 --> 00:27:53,900
that your body needs the blood to to

670
00:27:53,900 --> 00:27:57,360
power your F3 reaction fight flight or

671
00:27:57,360 --> 00:28:00,960
or freeze it takes the blood from the

672
00:28:00,960 --> 00:28:03,179
side from your face from the capillaries

673
00:28:03,179 --> 00:28:05,700
there so you you tend to be a little

674
00:28:05,700 --> 00:28:06,960
paler

675
00:28:06,960 --> 00:28:09,360
um the capillaries tend to itch when the

676
00:28:09,360 --> 00:28:10,799
blood draws away from them so you get

677
00:28:10,799 --> 00:28:12,600
all these scratching things this is an

678
00:28:12,600 --> 00:28:13,620
indicator

679
00:28:13,620 --> 00:28:15,960
but it's only a single indicator

680
00:28:15,960 --> 00:28:18,000
because it could also be itching hairs

681
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:20,159
or anything else but

682
00:28:20,159 --> 00:28:22,919
together with a lot of other things it's

683
00:28:22,919 --> 00:28:26,120
definitely a story

684
00:28:26,120 --> 00:28:28,500
self-converting is always it's also a

685
00:28:28,500 --> 00:28:30,900
one that we see often people doing this

686
00:28:30,900 --> 00:28:33,120
they're they're basically hugging

687
00:28:33,120 --> 00:28:34,980
themselves

688
00:28:34,980 --> 00:28:37,799
and a subtle way of that is doing that

689
00:28:37,799 --> 00:28:40,500
the the closed posture having their

690
00:28:40,500 --> 00:28:42,419
hands in front of them but they're kind

691
00:28:42,419 --> 00:28:44,039
of comforting themselves

692
00:28:44,039 --> 00:28:46,620
because they know there's something to

693
00:28:46,620 --> 00:28:49,020
be afraid of

694
00:28:49,020 --> 00:28:50,880
um these are the visual cues that you

695
00:28:50,880 --> 00:28:53,159
can have there is more of them but as I

696
00:28:53,159 --> 00:28:55,500
said this is just a brief view so I'm

697
00:28:55,500 --> 00:28:57,600
still working on this to to get the list

698
00:28:57,600 --> 00:28:59,580
a little longer

699
00:28:59,580 --> 00:29:01,500
um verbal Clues

700
00:29:01,500 --> 00:29:04,320
very interesting if I ask any of you

701
00:29:04,320 --> 00:29:06,179
where you were um

702
00:29:06,179 --> 00:29:09,179
three years ago on February the 2nd at

703
00:29:09,179 --> 00:29:10,740
10 in the evening

704
00:29:10,740 --> 00:29:13,380
what what what would a normal reaction

705
00:29:13,380 --> 00:29:15,679
be

706
00:29:15,960 --> 00:29:18,299
she is I don't know

707
00:29:18,299 --> 00:29:22,020
if I would ask any of you guys a few

708
00:29:22,020 --> 00:29:26,840
um by that same time Rob the gas station

709
00:29:27,059 --> 00:29:29,220
that would be quite clear right

710
00:29:29,220 --> 00:29:31,140
no probably not

711
00:29:31,140 --> 00:29:32,000
no no

712
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:34,860
I think I would know

713
00:29:34,860 --> 00:29:37,980
yeah yeah I think I would know yeah no

714
00:29:37,980 --> 00:29:39,779
so so

715
00:29:39,779 --> 00:29:41,940
you have to really when you when you

716
00:29:41,940 --> 00:29:43,679
confront someone with stimulus you have

717
00:29:43,679 --> 00:29:45,480
to take in account what what you would

718
00:29:45,480 --> 00:29:49,080
expect uh hesitation is not always bad I

719
00:29:49,080 --> 00:29:50,820
would expect hesitation if the question

720
00:29:50,820 --> 00:29:52,020
is

721
00:29:52,020 --> 00:29:54,659
calling for hesitation where were you

722
00:29:54,659 --> 00:29:56,580
that understand of course someone has to

723
00:29:56,580 --> 00:29:59,460
think about it oh let me see but if you

724
00:29:59,460 --> 00:30:00,840
confront them with a question like that

725
00:30:00,840 --> 00:30:02,880
did you do it

726
00:30:02,880 --> 00:30:06,419
they shouldn't go like uh

727
00:30:06,419 --> 00:30:09,960
so why do people do it anyway they are

728
00:30:09,960 --> 00:30:11,880
considering consequences

729
00:30:11,880 --> 00:30:14,460
 what if he knows

730
00:30:14,460 --> 00:30:16,799
and this is what we call mind fires I'll

731
00:30:16,799 --> 00:30:18,299
I'll have that in a bullet point

732
00:30:18,299 --> 00:30:20,940
somewhere later about a bind virus is a

733
00:30:20,940 --> 00:30:23,580
very interesting little thing

734
00:30:23,580 --> 00:30:26,039
um when you see a mine virus in action

735
00:30:26,039 --> 00:30:28,740
is when you come into work in in the

736
00:30:28,740 --> 00:30:29,520
morning

737
00:30:29,520 --> 00:30:31,380
and your colleague comes up to you and

738
00:30:31,380 --> 00:30:33,840
says very friendly key

739
00:30:33,840 --> 00:30:37,020
the boss wants to see you right away

740
00:30:37,020 --> 00:30:39,419
what do you think when you heard what

741
00:30:39,419 --> 00:30:42,500
what happens in your head

742
00:30:43,140 --> 00:30:46,340
oh I'm getting a race finally

743
00:30:46,340 --> 00:30:50,399
no people tend to go for the negative

744
00:30:50,399 --> 00:30:54,860
Alchemy oh what the oh and and

745
00:30:54,860 --> 00:30:57,840
on your way to the office of the bus

746
00:30:57,840 --> 00:31:00,419
this gets worse and worse

747
00:31:00,419 --> 00:31:02,700
and you you you're almost afraid to open

748
00:31:02,700 --> 00:31:05,520
the door and he says hey good morning

749
00:31:05,520 --> 00:31:07,320
um yeah I just wanted to tell you that

750
00:31:07,320 --> 00:31:11,460
you did a great job yesterday thanks

751
00:31:11,520 --> 00:31:12,299
um

752
00:31:12,299 --> 00:31:15,240
this this happens but your mind does all

753
00:31:15,240 --> 00:31:17,100
this crazy stuff that's what we call

754
00:31:17,100 --> 00:31:19,679
mindfires and you can use that to your

755
00:31:19,679 --> 00:31:21,299
advantage

756
00:31:21,299 --> 00:31:23,640
so when you question people

757
00:31:23,640 --> 00:31:25,679
um sometimes we ask them

758
00:31:25,679 --> 00:31:26,940
um

759
00:31:26,940 --> 00:31:30,419
so let's take an example we have this

760
00:31:30,419 --> 00:31:33,360
criminal and he robbed the place and we

761
00:31:33,360 --> 00:31:35,520
asked him uh what happened there were

762
00:31:35,520 --> 00:31:38,039
you there what what exactly happened he

763
00:31:38,039 --> 00:31:39,840
said oh man I've never been there I

764
00:31:39,840 --> 00:31:42,600
wasn't there yesterday and I wasn't uh

765
00:31:42,600 --> 00:31:45,240
he said okay

766
00:31:45,240 --> 00:31:46,440
okay

767
00:31:46,440 --> 00:31:49,200
um look and you take your papers which

768
00:31:49,200 --> 00:31:51,000
are obviously blank because you don't

769
00:31:51,000 --> 00:31:52,380
have anything yet

770
00:31:52,380 --> 00:31:53,640
so

771
00:31:53,640 --> 00:31:55,740
um I'm looking at this is there any

772
00:31:55,740 --> 00:31:56,700
reason

773
00:31:56,700 --> 00:31:58,559
that someone would

774
00:31:58,559 --> 00:32:00,480
tell us that they saw you there

775
00:32:00,480 --> 00:32:02,039
yesterday

776
00:32:02,039 --> 00:32:04,860
and that's where he gets the Mind fires

777
00:32:04,860 --> 00:32:08,039
 someone saw me what happened

778
00:32:08,039 --> 00:32:11,360
and that's where he he gets you know

779
00:32:11,360 --> 00:32:13,860
uncomfortable and he starts getting into

780
00:32:13,860 --> 00:32:15,539
trouble in his own head

781
00:32:15,539 --> 00:32:17,940
and this is what we do when we question

782
00:32:17,940 --> 00:32:21,120
people we try to be non-confrontational

783
00:32:21,120 --> 00:32:24,539
because you know the good cup bad cop it

784
00:32:24,539 --> 00:32:26,820
doesn't work but you have to try and get

785
00:32:26,820 --> 00:32:28,860
someone in a real conversation and when

786
00:32:28,860 --> 00:32:31,440
they start when they when they keep you

787
00:32:31,440 --> 00:32:33,419
know trying to get around and getting

788
00:32:33,419 --> 00:32:36,840
one of those categories there uh yeah no

789
00:32:36,840 --> 00:32:39,480
I wasn't I wasn't and you said well what

790
00:32:39,480 --> 00:32:41,220
if you were

791
00:32:41,220 --> 00:32:43,679
because we might have a witness don't

792
00:32:43,679 --> 00:32:45,720
Bluff don't tell them do you have a

793
00:32:45,720 --> 00:32:47,039
witness don't

794
00:32:47,039 --> 00:32:50,220
because that would be bad if if things

795
00:32:50,220 --> 00:32:51,960
turn out a certain way and you have to

796
00:32:51,960 --> 00:32:53,580
confront them and you have nothing that

797
00:32:53,580 --> 00:32:55,140
is very bad

798
00:32:55,140 --> 00:32:57,659
but you could ask him would there be any

799
00:32:57,659 --> 00:32:58,860
reason

800
00:32:58,860 --> 00:33:00,480
that someone

801
00:33:00,480 --> 00:33:03,840
told us that he saw you there

802
00:33:03,840 --> 00:33:06,899
I'm not saying anything basically

803
00:33:06,899 --> 00:33:10,020
I'm I am planting the Mind virus

804
00:33:10,020 --> 00:33:12,679
so this is very sneaky

805
00:33:12,679 --> 00:33:16,140
unintended messages is also um there's

806
00:33:16,140 --> 00:33:18,720
there's cases of people

807
00:33:18,720 --> 00:33:19,320
um

808
00:33:19,320 --> 00:33:22,140
this is quite interesting if you ask

809
00:33:22,140 --> 00:33:25,080
someone what should happen to someone

810
00:33:25,080 --> 00:33:27,299
who did the thing that we are speaking

811
00:33:27,299 --> 00:33:29,039
of right now

812
00:33:29,039 --> 00:33:30,779
and his response was well I wouldn't

813
00:33:30,779 --> 00:33:32,399
want to go to jail

814
00:33:32,399 --> 00:33:34,019
uh

815
00:33:34,019 --> 00:33:36,600
I would uh

816
00:33:36,600 --> 00:33:39,659
basically that's a confession

817
00:33:39,659 --> 00:33:43,080
I wouldn't want to go to jail

818
00:33:43,080 --> 00:33:45,059
but when you get people in short-term

819
00:33:45,059 --> 00:33:48,360
thinking they sometimes utter stuff that

820
00:33:48,360 --> 00:33:49,200
are

821
00:33:49,200 --> 00:33:52,019
that's incriminating by itself so you

822
00:33:52,019 --> 00:33:53,340
should really listen for these

823
00:33:53,340 --> 00:33:55,200
unintended messages

824
00:33:55,200 --> 00:33:59,100
these are the verbal Clues so um

825
00:33:59,100 --> 00:34:00,840
once again don't drink from the fire

826
00:34:00,840 --> 00:34:02,820
hydrant try to ignore everything that's

827
00:34:02,820 --> 00:34:04,500
normal

828
00:34:04,500 --> 00:34:06,480
when people give a presentation they

829
00:34:06,480 --> 00:34:08,580
have a certain way of Behaving I'm

830
00:34:08,580 --> 00:34:10,320
constantly moving anchor points right

831
00:34:10,320 --> 00:34:11,399
now

832
00:34:11,399 --> 00:34:12,899
sure

833
00:34:12,899 --> 00:34:15,599
okay but this is my Baseline and when

834
00:34:15,599 --> 00:34:18,000
you observe me for a longer time you see

835
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:20,520
me behaving normally like this so this

836
00:34:20,520 --> 00:34:23,280
is not weird

837
00:34:23,280 --> 00:34:25,859
what gets interesting is that if I'm

838
00:34:25,859 --> 00:34:27,899
normally like this and I'm standing like

839
00:34:27,899 --> 00:34:29,280
this

840
00:34:29,280 --> 00:34:32,520
and at a certain point or or and at a

841
00:34:32,520 --> 00:34:34,699
certain topic I start to

842
00:34:34,699 --> 00:34:38,280
move nervously and and do this and this

843
00:34:38,280 --> 00:34:39,480
is very interesting when you watch

844
00:34:39,480 --> 00:34:41,639
politicians on TV

845
00:34:41,639 --> 00:34:44,699
you can almost see the LIE

846
00:34:44,699 --> 00:34:47,580
they are behind this this nice table and

847
00:34:47,580 --> 00:34:48,960
they're telling people like this and

848
00:34:48,960 --> 00:34:51,179
this and this and at a certain point you

849
00:34:51,179 --> 00:34:54,780
see all these movements that day and of

850
00:34:54,780 --> 00:34:57,060
course they had trading so they are very

851
00:34:57,060 --> 00:34:58,619
subtle

852
00:34:58,619 --> 00:35:02,040
they they get trained not to do that but

853
00:35:02,040 --> 00:35:04,680
sometimes you just can't help yourself

854
00:35:04,680 --> 00:35:06,720
so when you have a Baseline and you see

855
00:35:06,720 --> 00:35:09,480
how they normally behave in is done like

856
00:35:09,480 --> 00:35:13,859
this and from very very you know so

857
00:35:13,859 --> 00:35:16,140
routine you know I'm telling units and

858
00:35:16,140 --> 00:35:17,579
at a certain point you see them doing

859
00:35:17,579 --> 00:35:19,079
this

860
00:35:19,079 --> 00:35:21,540
and these anchor points move and they

861
00:35:21,540 --> 00:35:24,540
start to you know uh touch their lips

862
00:35:24,540 --> 00:35:26,760
because they catch a dry mouth that's

863
00:35:26,760 --> 00:35:29,640
also a thing that happens when you lie

864
00:35:29,640 --> 00:35:33,420
uh not an indicator by itself because it

865
00:35:33,420 --> 00:35:35,400
could have a lot of reasons but with all

866
00:35:35,400 --> 00:35:37,320
the other indicators together you you

867
00:35:37,320 --> 00:35:38,880
have this cluster and when you see a

868
00:35:38,880 --> 00:35:42,900
cluster then there is reason for concern

869
00:35:42,900 --> 00:35:44,820
and it's just what it is it's reason for

870
00:35:44,820 --> 00:35:47,820
concern it's not a confession

871
00:35:47,820 --> 00:35:50,700
it's not a definite answer but it has it

872
00:35:50,700 --> 00:35:52,380
tells you you have more work in that

873
00:35:52,380 --> 00:35:53,520
area

874
00:35:53,520 --> 00:35:57,259
so Focus your questioning there

875
00:35:57,359 --> 00:35:59,040
um

876
00:35:59,040 --> 00:36:01,260
only a short time after the stimulus

877
00:36:01,260 --> 00:36:03,540
this is very this is logical right let

878
00:36:03,540 --> 00:36:05,040
me see the clock

879
00:36:05,040 --> 00:36:08,540
10 seconds 10 10 minutes okay uh

880
00:36:08,540 --> 00:36:10,260
okay

881
00:36:10,260 --> 00:36:11,940
um

882
00:36:11,940 --> 00:36:13,859
when you when you confront someone with

883
00:36:13,859 --> 00:36:16,440
a stimulation you have this question

884
00:36:16,440 --> 00:36:18,000
um

885
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:18,839
um

886
00:36:18,839 --> 00:36:21,240
the longer you take after the question

887
00:36:21,240 --> 00:36:24,300
the more could happen in his head

888
00:36:24,300 --> 00:36:26,820
so the response that you see maybe a

889
00:36:26,820 --> 00:36:28,859
minute after you ask a question could be

890
00:36:28,859 --> 00:36:31,560
about something entirely different

891
00:36:31,560 --> 00:36:34,140
you want to define the first five to ten

892
00:36:34,140 --> 00:36:37,140
seconds after a stimulus that's what

893
00:36:37,140 --> 00:36:38,940
what your answer is

894
00:36:38,940 --> 00:36:41,280
and if you don't see an answer

895
00:36:41,280 --> 00:36:43,200
well sometimes there is just nothing

896
00:36:43,200 --> 00:36:45,780
there but you could also try another

897
00:36:45,780 --> 00:36:49,200
stimulus or just just try poking around

898
00:36:49,200 --> 00:36:50,579
a little

899
00:36:50,579 --> 00:36:53,940
it's not questioning like the FBI where

900
00:36:53,940 --> 00:36:57,180
were you that evening and he's the good

901
00:36:57,180 --> 00:36:59,220
cup and I'm the bad cop that's not how

902
00:36:59,220 --> 00:37:00,900
it works that's not how you question

903
00:37:00,900 --> 00:37:02,760
people

904
00:37:02,760 --> 00:37:04,619
um

905
00:37:04,619 --> 00:37:08,640
a good hint also a good advice which is

906
00:37:08,640 --> 00:37:10,980
not yet in my slides but you should also

907
00:37:10,980 --> 00:37:13,560
be non-confrontational there should not

908
00:37:13,560 --> 00:37:16,200
be uh you should not be the one they

909
00:37:16,200 --> 00:37:18,000
have to fear

910
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:20,640
you're just there to to help them get to

911
00:37:20,640 --> 00:37:23,280
you know to resolve an issue

912
00:37:23,280 --> 00:37:26,099
and what I sometimes do is say look I I

913
00:37:26,099 --> 00:37:28,260
think I know what happened and when and

914
00:37:28,260 --> 00:37:29,820
and where

915
00:37:29,820 --> 00:37:32,220
I'm still not sure about how

916
00:37:32,220 --> 00:37:34,320
or why

917
00:37:34,320 --> 00:37:36,359
just help me out because we have to

918
00:37:36,359 --> 00:37:39,420
resolve this this is you know and

919
00:37:39,420 --> 00:37:41,520
sometimes that gets that gets people to

920
00:37:41,520 --> 00:37:42,480
talk

921
00:37:42,480 --> 00:37:45,780
and you get surprising answers

922
00:37:45,780 --> 00:37:48,660
that they they are therefore screening

923
00:37:48,660 --> 00:37:50,280
interview and they have a foreign

924
00:37:50,280 --> 00:37:51,660
girlfriend and they're worried about

925
00:37:51,660 --> 00:37:52,920
that or

926
00:37:52,920 --> 00:37:54,780
but sometimes they're you get really

927
00:37:54,780 --> 00:37:56,220
surprising answers

928
00:37:56,220 --> 00:37:58,920
so this is just your your way of

929
00:37:58,920 --> 00:38:00,960
questioning but also the way that you

930
00:38:00,960 --> 00:38:03,900
position yourself you are not the enemy

931
00:38:03,900 --> 00:38:06,420
always keep that in mind if you go and

932
00:38:06,420 --> 00:38:09,000
and question someone because this sounds

933
00:38:09,000 --> 00:38:11,460
like you're an FBI investigator I'm

934
00:38:11,460 --> 00:38:13,320
going I'm going to question this guy and

935
00:38:13,320 --> 00:38:15,900
let me see I won't I'll get the truth

936
00:38:15,900 --> 00:38:19,680
that's the one thing you should never do

937
00:38:19,680 --> 00:38:23,579
you're basically the one helping him

938
00:38:23,579 --> 00:38:26,700
so non-confrontational that's basically

939
00:38:26,700 --> 00:38:29,760
what I said and keep them in short term

940
00:38:29,760 --> 00:38:32,099
short term is keep them in the

941
00:38:32,099 --> 00:38:34,619
conversation with you you are the one

942
00:38:34,619 --> 00:38:38,400
trying to help what happened what try to

943
00:38:38,400 --> 00:38:42,619
get all the W questions when what where

944
00:38:52,859 --> 00:38:55,020
it's the book by Daniel Cattleman right

945
00:38:55,020 --> 00:38:57,140
yeah

946
00:38:57,140 --> 00:38:58,820
not

947
00:38:58,820 --> 00:39:01,680
really now this is more about

948
00:39:01,680 --> 00:39:04,140
um you are in system two already

949
00:39:04,140 --> 00:39:06,359
but uh so you're thinking about your

950
00:39:06,359 --> 00:39:08,940
answer uh the the system one is more the

951
00:39:08,940 --> 00:39:11,339
automatic response so that's not the

952
00:39:11,339 --> 00:39:12,480
case here

953
00:39:12,480 --> 00:39:14,400
um that is that is the first five

954
00:39:14,400 --> 00:39:16,740
seconds that's a system one

955
00:39:16,740 --> 00:39:19,020
that system one responds to the Anchor

956
00:39:19,020 --> 00:39:20,520
appointment movements and then the

957
00:39:20,520 --> 00:39:23,880
competing that's automatic but this is

958
00:39:23,880 --> 00:39:27,359
already system two and you are

959
00:39:27,359 --> 00:39:28,020
um

960
00:39:28,020 --> 00:39:29,880
you're trying to get them into

961
00:39:29,880 --> 00:39:32,280
conversation so look what happened and

962
00:39:32,280 --> 00:39:36,359
so this is it is thought over

963
00:39:36,359 --> 00:39:38,280
and deliberate

964
00:39:38,280 --> 00:39:40,800
but it's not long term because if you

965
00:39:40,800 --> 00:39:44,400
give them the time to go long term

966
00:39:44,400 --> 00:39:47,099
and I start realizing I could go to

967
00:39:47,099 --> 00:39:48,839
jail maybe for a long time and I could

968
00:39:48,839 --> 00:39:51,060
do it then do you give them a reason to

969
00:39:51,060 --> 00:39:54,780
draw back and and fight harder you don't

970
00:39:54,780 --> 00:39:57,420
want you want to keep inviting them to

971
00:39:57,420 --> 00:40:00,720
talk and keep them short thinking don't

972
00:40:00,720 --> 00:40:03,119
don't give them a chance to go and think

973
00:40:03,119 --> 00:40:05,760
about consequences if there are any

974
00:40:05,760 --> 00:40:08,640
I'm gonna lose that contract I'm gonna

975
00:40:08,640 --> 00:40:11,520
don't don't make him go there

976
00:40:11,520 --> 00:40:13,820
and how you do that is keep them short

977
00:40:13,820 --> 00:40:17,040
just keep them in your conversation

978
00:40:17,040 --> 00:40:19,619
so this is what you what you do

979
00:40:19,619 --> 00:40:21,480
that's what I mean by the short-term

980
00:40:21,480 --> 00:40:24,300
thinking not the system one that is even

981
00:40:24,300 --> 00:40:26,460
before that that's the stimulus response

982
00:40:26,460 --> 00:40:29,220
thing I was talking about

983
00:40:29,220 --> 00:40:30,380
um

984
00:40:30,380 --> 00:40:33,599
it's it's hard to lie in commission have

985
00:40:33,599 --> 00:40:35,700
you ever tried that

986
00:40:35,700 --> 00:40:37,740
if if you know you did something just

987
00:40:37,740 --> 00:40:39,180
say no

988
00:40:39,180 --> 00:40:41,940
that's quite hard actually

989
00:40:41,940 --> 00:40:44,760
any training for that you really need to

990
00:40:44,760 --> 00:40:47,579
be a politician or something too

991
00:40:47,579 --> 00:40:49,740
um it's it's actually hard to line

992
00:40:49,740 --> 00:40:51,900
commission if you know that is it's not

993
00:40:51,900 --> 00:40:54,480
the case or it it is and you're telling

994
00:40:54,480 --> 00:40:56,520
people it's not this is quite hard

995
00:40:56,520 --> 00:40:59,339
because the mind fires is already there

996
00:40:59,339 --> 00:41:01,859
 what if they know what it's and and

997
00:41:01,859 --> 00:41:04,619
I told them that's why our prime

998
00:41:04,619 --> 00:41:07,440
minister always says well not to my

999
00:41:07,440 --> 00:41:10,920
knowledge no I don't recall really

1000
00:41:10,920 --> 00:41:13,079
it's a lot safer

1001
00:41:13,079 --> 00:41:16,560
it's a lot safer but it is an indicator

1002
00:41:16,560 --> 00:41:19,200
for us we just know that's not true

1003
00:41:19,200 --> 00:41:22,680
because look evidence right here

1004
00:41:22,680 --> 00:41:24,540
that would be solid

1005
00:41:24,540 --> 00:41:26,339
even if it's but it would be

1006
00:41:26,339 --> 00:41:28,440
really solid but it's hard to do because

1007
00:41:28,440 --> 00:41:31,140
he knows that if at any time in the

1008
00:41:31,140 --> 00:41:33,180
future you come with confronting with

1009
00:41:33,180 --> 00:41:35,280
with different evidence and he's look

1010
00:41:35,280 --> 00:41:37,740
it's not true you're just

1011
00:41:37,740 --> 00:41:40,260
it gets in more trouble so it's safer

1012
00:41:40,260 --> 00:41:42,060
for him to say well not to my knowledge

1013
00:41:42,060 --> 00:41:44,880
I don't recall this is what politicians

1014
00:41:44,880 --> 00:41:47,520
they care training not by me by the way

1015
00:41:47,520 --> 00:41:49,380
so

1016
00:41:49,380 --> 00:41:52,020
um mind fires we covered that the whole

1017
00:41:52,020 --> 00:41:54,660
truth uh omissions

1018
00:41:54,660 --> 00:41:57,060
if you think there are omissions try to

1019
00:41:57,060 --> 00:41:58,740
timeline a story

1020
00:41:58,740 --> 00:42:00,980
drill down on gaps

1021
00:42:00,980 --> 00:42:04,619
so the the story about the lover in in

1022
00:42:04,619 --> 00:42:06,660
your business trip

1023
00:42:06,660 --> 00:42:09,300
okay so and you spent the entire evening

1024
00:42:09,300 --> 00:42:11,579
in a restaurant then

1025
00:42:11,579 --> 00:42:13,339
mine fires

1026
00:42:13,339 --> 00:42:16,680
uh yeah I couldn't be right right uh how

1027
00:42:16,680 --> 00:42:18,960
could I explain for this so you see all

1028
00:42:18,960 --> 00:42:20,400
these indicators because they're

1029
00:42:20,400 --> 00:42:22,440
thinking about so try to get a timeline

1030
00:42:22,440 --> 00:42:25,440
and drill down on the moments that are

1031
00:42:25,440 --> 00:42:28,579
not logical

1032
00:42:29,940 --> 00:42:31,140
um

1033
00:42:31,140 --> 00:42:34,320
lies of influence are very sneaky

1034
00:42:34,320 --> 00:42:37,260
there's just three advices there don't

1035
00:42:37,260 --> 00:42:38,880
get distracted

1036
00:42:38,880 --> 00:42:40,980
because this could be a very very good

1037
00:42:40,980 --> 00:42:43,380
story but it has nothing to do with with

1038
00:42:43,380 --> 00:42:46,020
the actual question or it has nothing to

1039
00:42:46,020 --> 00:42:47,579
do with what what you're actually

1040
00:42:47,579 --> 00:42:50,160
investigating so don't get distracted

1041
00:42:50,160 --> 00:42:52,320
don't get biased

1042
00:42:52,320 --> 00:42:55,020
oh this guy must be a railroad employee

1043
00:42:55,020 --> 00:42:57,660
he looks that way and he knows all his

1044
00:42:57,660 --> 00:42:58,500
stuff

1045
00:42:58,500 --> 00:43:00,900
don't don't do that don't don't jump to

1046
00:43:00,900 --> 00:43:02,880
any conclusions as well

1047
00:43:02,880 --> 00:43:05,040
so this is that's your only defense

1048
00:43:05,040 --> 00:43:07,380
about these lies of influence

1049
00:43:07,380 --> 00:43:09,540
just try to keep him short keep him to

1050
00:43:09,540 --> 00:43:12,180
the point what you actually what are you

1051
00:43:12,180 --> 00:43:13,680
actually saying

1052
00:43:13,680 --> 00:43:18,180
did you go by train did you pretend to

1053
00:43:18,180 --> 00:43:20,940
be an employee did you so this is to be

1054
00:43:20,940 --> 00:43:22,560
very concrete and don't let them take

1055
00:43:22,560 --> 00:43:23,280
you

1056
00:43:23,280 --> 00:43:26,540
for for a ride

1057
00:43:27,420 --> 00:43:30,240
um it's almost time right

1058
00:43:30,240 --> 00:43:31,980
yeah okay

1059
00:43:31,980 --> 00:43:33,660
a few more then

1060
00:43:33,660 --> 00:43:34,680
um

1061
00:43:34,680 --> 00:43:36,900
these are some example questions you

1062
00:43:36,900 --> 00:43:37,859
could

1063
00:43:37,859 --> 00:43:38,520
um

1064
00:43:38,520 --> 00:43:41,880
do a sort of assumption

1065
00:43:41,880 --> 00:43:44,819
what happened there yesterday

1066
00:43:44,819 --> 00:43:46,619
so you actually you assumed that he was

1067
00:43:46,619 --> 00:43:48,300
there right

1068
00:43:48,300 --> 00:43:51,119
and just look at the response

1069
00:43:51,119 --> 00:43:53,339
a normal response for an innocent guy

1070
00:43:53,339 --> 00:43:55,079
was saying how would I know I wasn't

1071
00:43:55,079 --> 00:43:55,980
there

1072
00:43:55,980 --> 00:43:58,560
uh but a good liar could also do that so

1073
00:43:58,560 --> 00:44:00,839
just be very careful looking at a

1074
00:44:00,839 --> 00:44:02,400
response in the first five to ten

1075
00:44:02,400 --> 00:44:05,099
seconds uh the Mind fires we cover that

1076
00:44:05,099 --> 00:44:06,300
right

1077
00:44:06,300 --> 00:44:07,980
is there any reason that someone would

1078
00:44:07,980 --> 00:44:09,240
tell me differently

1079
00:44:09,240 --> 00:44:12,960
and if you could act a little pretend

1080
00:44:12,960 --> 00:44:14,700
you have some evidence or something in

1081
00:44:14,700 --> 00:44:17,160
your hand that would prove otherwise

1082
00:44:17,160 --> 00:44:19,020
yeah that helps

1083
00:44:19,020 --> 00:44:21,119
but never Bluff never tell them that you

1084
00:44:21,119 --> 00:44:23,099
have have it when you don't

1085
00:44:23,099 --> 00:44:25,740
and a punishment to question this works

1086
00:44:25,740 --> 00:44:27,300
great on kids

1087
00:44:27,300 --> 00:44:28,560
uh

1088
00:44:28,560 --> 00:44:30,660
uh did you steal the cookies

1089
00:44:30,660 --> 00:44:33,180
what do you think uh should happen to

1090
00:44:33,180 --> 00:44:36,119
someone who stole cookies

1091
00:44:36,119 --> 00:44:39,119
the response tells you a lot because a

1092
00:44:39,119 --> 00:44:43,079
guilty person would probably start you

1093
00:44:43,079 --> 00:44:46,680
know negotiating their own sentence

1094
00:44:46,680 --> 00:44:48,839
so this is also a thing that that you

1095
00:44:48,839 --> 00:44:50,700
could do

1096
00:44:50,700 --> 00:44:53,760
whoa that's as far as I got we're just

1097
00:44:53,760 --> 00:44:57,980
one minute on the clock so any questions

1098
00:44:58,440 --> 00:45:00,540
what happens to all these kind of

1099
00:45:00,540 --> 00:45:02,700
stimuli when the liar has convinced

1100
00:45:02,700 --> 00:45:04,980
themselves you have other indicators

1101
00:45:04,980 --> 00:45:07,079
that you can use I think that would be

1102
00:45:07,079 --> 00:45:09,720
this slide no but it's a very good

1103
00:45:09,720 --> 00:45:12,359
question I have done business with a guy

1104
00:45:12,359 --> 00:45:16,920
who was a notorious liar just nothing he

1105
00:45:16,920 --> 00:45:19,859
he said was checked out any wow never

1106
00:45:19,859 --> 00:45:22,920
was just lying about everything but I

1107
00:45:22,920 --> 00:45:24,359
could never see it

1108
00:45:24,359 --> 00:45:27,300
and when I uh mostly we went for coffee

1109
00:45:27,300 --> 00:45:29,099
and I said okay I see you tomorrow at 10

1110
00:45:29,099 --> 00:45:30,839
he said yeah tomorrow at 10 no problem

1111
00:45:30,839 --> 00:45:32,220
see you there

1112
00:45:32,220 --> 00:45:34,200
and he didn't show up and it wasn't just

1113
00:45:34,200 --> 00:45:36,240
you know you sit there

1114
00:45:36,240 --> 00:45:37,619
 he did it again

1115
00:45:37,619 --> 00:45:38,819
but

1116
00:45:38,819 --> 00:45:40,859
it was very frustrating for me to never

1117
00:45:40,859 --> 00:45:42,359
see him lie

1118
00:45:42,359 --> 00:45:45,000
because there was no lie he was actually

1119
00:45:45,000 --> 00:45:47,760
really planning on being there the next

1120
00:45:47,760 --> 00:45:50,579
morning so from that perspective he was

1121
00:45:50,579 --> 00:45:54,300
not lying at all so it's not a lie and

1122
00:45:54,300 --> 00:45:56,400
this makes it very hard so it's a good

1123
00:45:56,400 --> 00:45:59,040
question I think I should really put

1124
00:45:59,040 --> 00:46:02,099
that in here because it is an

1125
00:46:02,099 --> 00:46:04,680
an exceptional category

1126
00:46:04,680 --> 00:46:08,700
not lying at all but still lying right

1127
00:46:08,700 --> 00:46:10,980
so this is just very interesting

1128
00:46:10,980 --> 00:46:14,160
that's very hard to to detect because

1129
00:46:14,160 --> 00:46:16,560
there is nothing to detect

1130
00:46:16,560 --> 00:46:19,400
anything more

1131
00:46:23,640 --> 00:46:26,160
commission the plane lie yeah you look

1132
00:46:26,160 --> 00:46:27,540
great

1133
00:46:27,540 --> 00:46:30,540
area

1134
00:46:36,300 --> 00:46:38,099
saying everything yeah you would say

1135
00:46:38,099 --> 00:46:40,280
that right but it's still not the truth

1136
00:46:40,280 --> 00:46:43,380
that not the entire truth action

1137
00:46:43,380 --> 00:46:46,079
it's exactly and what we are looking for

1138
00:46:46,079 --> 00:46:48,660
is is the information the truth the

1139
00:46:48,660 --> 00:46:51,480
whole truth and nothing I saw you

1140
00:46:51,480 --> 00:46:53,819
um we are looking for the truth the

1141
00:46:53,819 --> 00:46:55,140
whole truth nothing but the truth we

1142
00:46:55,140 --> 00:46:56,700
want a complete package we want to know

1143
00:46:56,700 --> 00:46:59,099
what happened where who

1144
00:46:59,099 --> 00:47:01,380
and and everything that happened because

1145
00:47:01,380 --> 00:47:04,380
uh and so if you leave stuff out which

1146
00:47:04,380 --> 00:47:06,560
which could be significant

1147
00:47:06,560 --> 00:47:10,819
then we still call it a lie

1148
00:47:12,000 --> 00:47:15,900
no no there's no gray area no you're not

1149
00:47:15,900 --> 00:47:18,240
being truthful well you you could deem

1150
00:47:18,240 --> 00:47:21,480
things irrelevant maybe but uh then you

1151
00:47:21,480 --> 00:47:23,700
still could talk about it you look yeah

1152
00:47:23,700 --> 00:47:26,220
I went into that little shop but just to

1153
00:47:26,220 --> 00:47:28,260
get a candy bar you know it doesn't

1154
00:47:28,260 --> 00:47:30,960
really you know but just to be very

1155
00:47:30,960 --> 00:47:33,839
complete yeah about cut a candy bar on

1156
00:47:33,839 --> 00:47:34,980
the way home

1157
00:47:34,980 --> 00:47:39,000
so yeah it could be irrelevant but then

1158
00:47:39,000 --> 00:47:41,579
just talk about it I saw someone over

1159
00:47:41,579 --> 00:47:43,760
there

1160
00:47:49,980 --> 00:47:52,440
uh

1161
00:47:52,440 --> 00:47:54,660
I think that's related to the question

1162
00:47:54,660 --> 00:47:57,480
also here you you're really you know

1163
00:47:57,480 --> 00:47:59,339
that or you think that you're telling

1164
00:47:59,339 --> 00:48:01,680
the truth so that's hard to detect

1165
00:48:01,680 --> 00:48:03,839
except when you're reinforabru because

1166
00:48:03,839 --> 00:48:05,339
you look like this

1167
00:48:05,339 --> 00:48:09,119
you know so but but if you're convinced

1168
00:48:09,119 --> 00:48:12,660
uh that you're telling the truth uh

1169
00:48:12,660 --> 00:48:14,760
because you're either too stupid you

1170
00:48:14,760 --> 00:48:17,160
know or or you are just really planning

1171
00:48:17,160 --> 00:48:19,920
to do it or it's it's for you it's not a

1172
00:48:19,920 --> 00:48:21,780
lie at that moment so the indicators

1173
00:48:21,780 --> 00:48:24,560
won't show

1174
00:48:26,720 --> 00:48:31,020
probably probably but it's then it's not

1175
00:48:31,020 --> 00:48:33,740
a lie so um for for This research

1176
00:48:33,740 --> 00:48:37,500
because it has no indicators it's it's a

1177
00:48:37,500 --> 00:48:40,740
tough tough area to go so I I kind of

1178
00:48:40,740 --> 00:48:43,200
excluded it but I still think I should

1179
00:48:43,200 --> 00:48:45,540
mention it because it's it is a good

1180
00:48:45,540 --> 00:48:47,339
question

1181
00:48:47,339 --> 00:48:49,619
you know what is the truth

1182
00:48:49,619 --> 00:48:51,240
perception

1183
00:48:51,240 --> 00:48:54,119
that's true there is this book by Hector

1184
00:48:54,119 --> 00:48:56,660
McDonald it's called Truth

1185
00:48:56,660 --> 00:48:59,400
and you should really read it because

1186
00:48:59,400 --> 00:49:01,859
there is lots of truths

1187
00:49:01,859 --> 00:49:04,680
so uh but but what we are referring to

1188
00:49:04,680 --> 00:49:08,099
is actually the the five W's right who

1189
00:49:08,099 --> 00:49:10,920
what where so this is this is really

1190
00:49:10,920 --> 00:49:14,400
solid that we we yeah we we really check

1191
00:49:14,400 --> 00:49:17,339
facts facts that you can actually check

1192
00:49:17,339 --> 00:49:21,780
so um but yeah good points there is some

1193
00:49:21,780 --> 00:49:24,359
forms of Truth where it's perception

1194
00:49:24,359 --> 00:49:27,300
maybe true for me but not for you that

1195
00:49:27,300 --> 00:49:30,740
that's that's the thing yeah

1196
00:49:32,040 --> 00:49:34,640
or

1197
00:49:35,160 --> 00:49:38,400
you were telling someone this uh you had

1198
00:49:38,400 --> 00:49:41,040
an appointment tomorrow at 10 and he

1199
00:49:41,040 --> 00:49:42,300
didn't show

1200
00:49:42,300 --> 00:49:44,160
up yeah well

1201
00:49:44,160 --> 00:49:47,760
your truth is different than his well my

1202
00:49:47,760 --> 00:49:49,440
truth is we had this appointment and

1203
00:49:49,440 --> 00:49:50,880
you're not here

1204
00:49:50,880 --> 00:49:54,780
that's a fact so uh whether he lied

1205
00:49:54,780 --> 00:49:55,980
about it

1206
00:49:55,980 --> 00:49:59,700
is debatable because he was actually

1207
00:49:59,700 --> 00:50:02,160
yeah he wanted to be there but in the

1208
00:50:02,160 --> 00:50:04,319
morning he got out of bed and the

1209
00:50:04,319 --> 00:50:06,319
oh

1210
00:50:06,319 --> 00:50:09,839
sure but at that moment it was not a lie

1211
00:50:09,839 --> 00:50:11,579
so no indicators

1212
00:50:11,579 --> 00:50:14,220
and this is about the indicators that

1213
00:50:14,220 --> 00:50:16,560
you could use to determine if someone is

1214
00:50:16,560 --> 00:50:18,359
Maybe

1215
00:50:18,359 --> 00:50:20,700
lying or being somewhat economic with

1216
00:50:20,700 --> 00:50:21,900
the truth

1217
00:50:21,900 --> 00:50:24,680
any truth

1218
00:50:25,319 --> 00:50:27,680
okay

1219
00:50:30,000 --> 00:50:32,700
that is very hard sometimes when you are

1220
00:50:32,700 --> 00:50:34,579
confronting a pedophile

1221
00:50:34,579 --> 00:50:38,160
and you're telling him that look um

1222
00:50:38,160 --> 00:50:40,500
I'm just trying to get the facts

1223
00:50:40,500 --> 00:50:42,780
straight and if I I would think that you

1224
00:50:42,780 --> 00:50:44,579
were a pedophile I wouldn't be able to

1225
00:50:44,579 --> 00:50:46,920
be in the same room with you that's

1226
00:50:46,920 --> 00:50:49,619
truthful but not entirely because I'm

1227
00:50:49,619 --> 00:50:51,660
there to question the guy

1228
00:50:51,660 --> 00:50:53,880
and

1229
00:50:53,880 --> 00:50:57,079
in a way I want to you know kick his ass

1230
00:50:57,079 --> 00:51:00,059
but you have to be professional at that

1231
00:51:00,059 --> 00:51:01,800
time so sometimes it's very very hard

1232
00:51:01,800 --> 00:51:04,440
you you know that there's something

1233
00:51:04,440 --> 00:51:07,079
wrong and you're really convinced that

1234
00:51:07,079 --> 00:51:08,640
you're on the right track and you almost

1235
00:51:08,640 --> 00:51:10,500
have all the evidence but there is just

1236
00:51:10,500 --> 00:51:13,140
this little bit and that's why they get

1237
00:51:13,140 --> 00:51:15,359
to you to help out to to get that little

1238
00:51:15,359 --> 00:51:17,099
bit

1239
00:51:17,099 --> 00:51:18,660
um it's it's very hard to stay

1240
00:51:18,660 --> 00:51:21,059
non-confrontational because

1241
00:51:21,059 --> 00:51:24,420
yeah I would I would not mind having a

1242
00:51:24,420 --> 00:51:27,240
few minutes alone with him uh but that

1243
00:51:27,240 --> 00:51:29,040
would be more of a Hollywood scenario

1244
00:51:29,040 --> 00:51:32,099
where you you are the bad cop good cop

1245
00:51:32,099 --> 00:51:34,380
bad cop terrible cup

1246
00:51:34,380 --> 00:51:35,280
um

1247
00:51:35,280 --> 00:51:37,200
but yeah that's that's a good point

1248
00:51:37,200 --> 00:51:41,059
sometimes it's hard to uh to stay

1249
00:51:41,059 --> 00:51:44,180
also in in business when you know the

1250
00:51:44,180 --> 00:51:47,099
the company that comes to pitch an idea

1251
00:51:47,099 --> 00:51:49,440
is total because you've seen

1252
00:51:49,440 --> 00:51:51,359
them time and time before you know this

1253
00:51:51,359 --> 00:51:54,180
is the only the the next in a long line

1254
00:51:54,180 --> 00:51:55,980
of stories

1255
00:51:55,980 --> 00:51:58,440
that takes up your time and your boss's

1256
00:51:58,440 --> 00:52:00,660
time and a lot of money and

1257
00:52:00,660 --> 00:52:04,500
it's it's quite hard to you know

1258
00:52:04,500 --> 00:52:07,020
be patient with them

1259
00:52:07,020 --> 00:52:10,460
so good point

1260
00:52:16,140 --> 00:52:19,040
when do you know that

1261
00:52:19,319 --> 00:52:22,140
like or you need somebody to confess

1262
00:52:22,140 --> 00:52:24,540
first when when your evidence is

1263
00:52:24,540 --> 00:52:26,700
conclusive so you when the evidence

1264
00:52:26,700 --> 00:52:28,500
speaks for itself you can say okay look

1265
00:52:28,500 --> 00:52:30,599
this happened because we have you on

1266
00:52:30,599 --> 00:52:33,059
video we have your prints we have this

1267
00:52:33,059 --> 00:52:35,400
we have all these Witnesses well then

1268
00:52:35,400 --> 00:52:37,020
it's very solid

1269
00:52:37,020 --> 00:52:39,599
but when you don't have that

1270
00:52:39,599 --> 00:52:42,660
when you don't you shouldn't overplay

1271
00:52:42,660 --> 00:52:43,619
your hand

1272
00:52:43,619 --> 00:52:48,480
so you you try to sometimes you could

1273
00:52:48,480 --> 00:52:51,000
plant these mind Fighters like ah

1274
00:52:51,000 --> 00:52:53,819
maybe someone did see me you know but

1275
00:52:53,819 --> 00:52:56,099
never tell them that someone did

1276
00:52:56,099 --> 00:52:58,319
don't go there because it will bite you

1277
00:52:58,319 --> 00:52:59,460
in the ass

1278
00:52:59,460 --> 00:53:02,760
if it gets to a court and they say okay

1279
00:53:02,760 --> 00:53:05,460
you said that there was evidence we saw

1280
00:53:05,460 --> 00:53:08,400
the video of your uh questioning

1281
00:53:08,400 --> 00:53:10,680
you told them there was evidence so

1282
00:53:10,680 --> 00:53:12,540
where is it

1283
00:53:12,540 --> 00:53:15,980
lawyers will eat you

1284
00:53:29,460 --> 00:53:32,880
no it's not a lie it's it's more

1285
00:53:32,880 --> 00:53:36,599
um a statement that I'm asking an extra

1286
00:53:36,599 --> 00:53:38,099
question it's more like an extra

1287
00:53:38,099 --> 00:53:42,359
question so the the framing I do is

1288
00:53:42,359 --> 00:53:44,819
okay you you're telling me that you

1289
00:53:44,819 --> 00:53:46,619
weren't there fine

1290
00:53:46,619 --> 00:53:47,400
um

1291
00:53:47,400 --> 00:53:50,819
could there be any any reason

1292
00:53:50,819 --> 00:53:53,880
now or or in the next week or any time

1293
00:53:53,880 --> 00:53:56,400
that someone would tell me differently

1294
00:53:56,400 --> 00:53:59,880
this is just a question right

1295
00:53:59,880 --> 00:54:02,280
I'm I'm fully entitled to ask that

1296
00:54:02,280 --> 00:54:04,200
question

1297
00:54:04,200 --> 00:54:06,059
um but what it does is plant out little

1298
00:54:06,059 --> 00:54:07,920
mind fires like

1299
00:54:07,920 --> 00:54:10,140
 maybe someone did maybe someone saw

1300
00:54:10,140 --> 00:54:12,180
me maybe and so they when they start

1301
00:54:12,180 --> 00:54:14,300
changing their story after that question

1302
00:54:14,300 --> 00:54:18,300
that is a very valuable indicator

1303
00:54:18,300 --> 00:54:22,579
it's a sneaky question that's true

1304
00:54:32,040 --> 00:54:34,740
yeah well you're the one I was most

1305
00:54:34,740 --> 00:54:36,440
afraid for

1306
00:54:36,440 --> 00:54:41,359
she's a paralegal so you know

1307
00:54:41,359 --> 00:54:43,859
I was afraid she would be going with

1308
00:54:43,859 --> 00:54:46,260
some kind of question like it but but

1309
00:54:46,260 --> 00:54:48,599
yeah we are very careful not to to break

1310
00:54:48,599 --> 00:54:51,059
the law ourselves of course uh but we

1311
00:54:51,059 --> 00:54:55,020
but we have to try and shake the tree

1312
00:54:55,020 --> 00:54:57,680
enough

1313
00:55:03,359 --> 00:55:06,480
of course that's why I get to assist in

1314
00:55:06,480 --> 00:55:08,900
these things

1315
00:55:09,000 --> 00:55:12,000
yeah of course it is but so so you

1316
00:55:12,000 --> 00:55:13,859
always try to support it by more

1317
00:55:13,859 --> 00:55:15,680
evidence and and

1318
00:55:15,680 --> 00:55:19,400
situational things and and context and

1319
00:55:19,400 --> 00:55:22,500
clusters and so it's not just the one

1320
00:55:22,500 --> 00:55:24,359
thing but it gives you an indication

1321
00:55:24,359 --> 00:55:26,160
that you're on the right path or you

1322
00:55:26,160 --> 00:55:27,140
should

1323
00:55:27,140 --> 00:55:29,760
investigate more in that direction

1324
00:55:29,760 --> 00:55:33,660
you should more see it as a as a pointer

1325
00:55:33,660 --> 00:55:36,180
like there's something that I really

1326
00:55:36,180 --> 00:55:39,240
don't know enough about yet

1327
00:55:39,240 --> 00:55:41,460
jiggling the key

1328
00:55:41,460 --> 00:55:44,180
yeah

1329
00:55:45,619 --> 00:55:48,240
get your kids lying do you teach them

1330
00:55:48,240 --> 00:55:52,260
how to properly no no

1331
00:55:52,260 --> 00:55:54,119
no

1332
00:55:54,119 --> 00:55:56,119
no no

1333
00:55:56,700 --> 00:55:59,099
yeah um the thing is that you you have

1334
00:55:59,099 --> 00:56:01,680
these indicators and you start being

1335
00:56:01,680 --> 00:56:03,900
confrontational about it and you plant a

1336
00:56:03,900 --> 00:56:06,119
little mindfires you say okay

1337
00:56:06,119 --> 00:56:08,760
well I'm used to it

1338
00:56:08,760 --> 00:56:12,020
yeah well

1339
00:56:13,079 --> 00:56:15,240
yeah

1340
00:56:15,240 --> 00:56:18,319
could be frustrating

1341
00:56:18,420 --> 00:56:20,520
yeah did I just see did I just see my

1342
00:56:20,520 --> 00:56:21,839

1343
00:56:21,839 --> 00:56:24,960
we have to work on that

1344
00:56:24,960 --> 00:56:27,300
we have to get we have to to come up

1345
00:56:27,300 --> 00:56:29,760
with a strategy for that before she

1346
00:56:29,760 --> 00:56:32,160
really gets professional

1347
00:56:32,160 --> 00:56:35,940
um now you know of course she in in your

1348
00:56:35,940 --> 00:56:37,980
upbringing you just stretch how

1349
00:56:37,980 --> 00:56:39,780
important is to tell the truth and and

1350
00:56:39,780 --> 00:56:42,780
try to you know be a good person you

1351
00:56:42,780 --> 00:56:45,300
should you just shouldn't do that and if

1352
00:56:45,300 --> 00:56:47,339
you're maybe 20 and you want to go into

1353
00:56:47,339 --> 00:56:49,460
pen testing come see me

1354
00:56:49,460 --> 00:56:52,920
no I'll help you yeah but

1355
00:56:52,920 --> 00:56:55,800
um of course so this is uh but kids are

1356
00:56:55,800 --> 00:56:58,500
very very special kind of you know

1357
00:56:58,500 --> 00:56:59,520
because

1358
00:56:59,520 --> 00:57:02,040
but they also and this is a good thing

1359
00:57:02,040 --> 00:57:05,280
they also have the clearest indicators

1360
00:57:05,280 --> 00:57:08,400
one gets lied I always like this

1361
00:57:08,400 --> 00:57:10,559
they cover their mouth because like

1362
00:57:10,559 --> 00:57:12,240
you're counting themselves and we we

1363
00:57:12,240 --> 00:57:14,880
learn to not do that anymore because

1364
00:57:14,880 --> 00:57:18,180
it's way too conspicuous but cats you

1365
00:57:18,180 --> 00:57:22,879
know it's just very clear not very cute

1366
00:57:28,460 --> 00:57:31,800
and and second I heard that if your kid

1367
00:57:31,800 --> 00:57:33,599
doesn't lie then you should be worried

1368
00:57:33,599 --> 00:57:35,940
because they are you know that's one

1369
00:57:35,940 --> 00:57:39,440
well it depends

1370
00:57:46,260 --> 00:57:49,200
well sometimes you you need to lie you

1371
00:57:49,200 --> 00:57:53,819
know uh if someone you like a lot uh ask

1372
00:57:53,819 --> 00:57:55,440
you for something that could be really

1373
00:57:55,440 --> 00:57:58,619
confrontational painful you try to

1374
00:57:58,619 --> 00:58:02,460
excuse me she is here right so you try

1375
00:58:02,460 --> 00:58:05,700
to to not hurt someone's feelings uh and

1376
00:58:05,700 --> 00:58:08,040
and that's the Little White Lies but

1377
00:58:08,040 --> 00:58:10,079
these are generally not the the lies

1378
00:58:10,079 --> 00:58:11,760
that catch you into trouble but when

1379
00:58:11,760 --> 00:58:13,859
someone produces evidence that it's not

1380
00:58:13,859 --> 00:58:17,760
true so yeah there's of course it's uh

1381
00:58:17,760 --> 00:58:20,819
there is some gray areas there but this

1382
00:58:20,819 --> 00:58:22,020
is about

1383
00:58:22,020 --> 00:58:24,780
um guys wasting your time wasting your

1384
00:58:24,780 --> 00:58:28,440
money or doing really really bad stuff

1385
00:58:28,440 --> 00:58:32,160
so okay last one then because

1386
00:58:32,160 --> 00:58:34,200
I think or or

1387
00:58:34,200 --> 00:58:38,180
are we good or is someone waiting

1388
00:58:39,540 --> 00:58:43,339
green uh okay last one

1389
00:58:45,020 --> 00:58:46,859
[Music]

1390
00:58:46,859 --> 00:58:50,180
for you for example

1391
00:58:52,160 --> 00:58:54,960
but if you know that your indicator was

1392
00:58:54,960 --> 00:58:56,700
catching your nose shouldn't you a

1393
00:58:56,700 --> 00:58:59,040
social engineer make sure because life

1394
00:58:59,040 --> 00:59:01,319
is your job that it's part of your

1395
00:59:01,319 --> 00:59:03,839
pattern so people think it's your normal

1396
00:59:03,839 --> 00:59:06,480
behavior so when you are lying people

1397
00:59:06,480 --> 00:59:08,760
don't assume your life yeah I've been

1398
00:59:08,760 --> 00:59:11,040
training a lot to do this all the time

1399
00:59:11,040 --> 00:59:14,940
now that's true but um it's not just the

1400
00:59:14,940 --> 00:59:17,400
one single it's it's a lot of indicators

1401
00:59:17,400 --> 00:59:19,079
and what you should

1402
00:59:19,079 --> 00:59:22,079
if you have the possibility to do so

1403
00:59:22,079 --> 00:59:24,599
what you do is establish a baseline so

1404
00:59:24,599 --> 00:59:26,940
observe someone beforehand in normal

1405
00:59:26,940 --> 00:59:30,480
behavior and and try to what I why I

1406
00:59:30,480 --> 00:59:32,040
told you about the politician being like

1407
00:59:32,040 --> 00:59:33,599
this all the time

1408
00:59:33,599 --> 00:59:37,200
and when it gets hairy they do like this

1409
00:59:37,200 --> 00:59:40,319
that that is that is significant

1410
00:59:40,319 --> 00:59:43,619
so that that is a deviation from the

1411
00:59:43,619 --> 00:59:45,780
Baseline

1412
00:59:45,780 --> 00:59:46,920
so

1413
00:59:46,920 --> 00:59:48,660
okay

1414
00:59:48,660 --> 00:59:51,000
um I'll be getting my lunch then and

1415
00:59:51,000 --> 00:59:52,920
after that I'll be in the bar so if any

1416
00:59:52,920 --> 00:59:55,200
more questions is that see you guys

1417
