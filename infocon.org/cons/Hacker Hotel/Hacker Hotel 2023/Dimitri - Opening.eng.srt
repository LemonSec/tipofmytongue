31
00:01:29,939 --> 00:01:32,220
and serve you

32
00:01:32,220 --> 00:01:33,420
um

33
00:01:33,420 --> 00:01:36,600
some information about the batch

34
00:01:36,600 --> 00:01:37,920
the merchandise

35
00:01:37,920 --> 00:01:39,479
some history

36
00:01:39,479 --> 00:01:42,180
a project of Dennis masalacom shoot all

37
00:01:42,180 --> 00:01:44,159
the hackers then there's some room for

38
00:01:44,159 --> 00:01:45,900
questions and then I will end with some

39
00:01:45,900 --> 00:01:47,640
wise word over

40
00:01:47,640 --> 00:01:49,560
one of my favorite

41
00:01:49,560 --> 00:01:52,380
rally drivers of all times

42
00:01:52,380 --> 00:01:55,560
so first I want to open up the event

43
00:01:55,560 --> 00:01:58,619
officially because last time there was

44
00:01:58,619 --> 00:02:00,840
some start button

45
00:02:00,840 --> 00:02:03,540
made by today fellow

46
00:02:03,540 --> 00:02:06,799
and now it's fully working

47
00:02:07,140 --> 00:02:09,119
so I really appreciate all the work that

48
00:02:09,119 --> 00:02:11,940
they put in this but supposedly if I

49
00:02:11,940 --> 00:02:13,080
close this there's a national

50
00:02:13,080 --> 00:02:15,360
hackerspace map where you can see all

51
00:02:15,360 --> 00:02:17,220
the hacker spaces of the Netherlands and

52
00:02:17,220 --> 00:02:18,840
when we close this we have a temporary

53
00:02:18,840 --> 00:02:20,520
entry on that map

54
00:02:20,520 --> 00:02:23,160
so when I close the switch in a few

55
00:02:23,160 --> 00:02:24,720
seconds minutes I don't know what the

56
00:02:24,720 --> 00:02:25,980
pulling time is

57
00:02:25,980 --> 00:02:28,140
we will 10 minutes we will show up as

58
00:02:28,140 --> 00:02:31,140

59
00:02:31,140 --> 00:02:32,879
we will officially open Hacker Hotel

60
00:02:32,879 --> 00:02:35,879

61
00:02:38,660 --> 00:02:42,379
three two

62
00:02:45,599 --> 00:02:48,120

63
00:02:48,120 --> 00:02:50,459

67
00:03:00,360 --> 00:03:02,040

00:07:33,840 --> 00:07:36,360
some physical hints

173
00:07:36,360 --> 00:07:39,060
spread out through this hotel

174
00:07:39,060 --> 00:07:41,940
they're both digital and analog

175
00:07:41,940 --> 00:07:44,220
and if you find them you can use them to

176
00:07:44,220 --> 00:07:45,539
solve challenges

177
00:07:45,539 --> 00:07:47,280
so

178
00:07:47,280 --> 00:07:49,580
go look around and you will find them

179
00:07:49,580 --> 00:07:52,860
sometimes close to a

180
00:07:52,860 --> 00:07:55,400
sticker

181
00:07:58,020 --> 00:08:00,500

182
00:08:00,900 --> 00:08:04,440

183
00:08:04,440 --> 00:08:08,660

184
00:08:10,319 --> 00:08:12,539
for the first time we have had Bungalow

185
00:08:12,539 --> 00:08:15,479
sniping what's Bungalow sniping

186
00:08:15,479 --> 00:08:17,400
you have a group of friends they want to

187
00:08:17,400 --> 00:08:19,740
buy a bungalow they say Dimitri we want

188
00:08:19,740 --> 00:08:21,060
the Bungalow

189
00:08:21,060 --> 00:08:23,340
I said okay I will open it up on the

190
00:08:23,340 --> 00:08:26,520
site you click and put it in your basket

191
00:08:26,520 --> 00:08:28,800
and then you pay me and you have a

192
00:08:28,800 --> 00:08:30,720
bungalow

193
00:08:30,720 --> 00:08:32,640
yeah it's okay I said but you need to be

194
00:08:32,640 --> 00:08:36,000
really quick because rooms are flying

195
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:37,380
and

196
00:08:37,380 --> 00:08:40,260
if it's open for too long someone will

197
00:08:40,260 --> 00:08:41,700
snitch it

198
00:08:41,700 --> 00:08:43,620
seriously within two minutes after

199
00:08:43,620 --> 00:08:45,060
opening it

200
00:08:45,060 --> 00:08:47,100
the person wanting to buy The Bungalow

201
00:08:47,100 --> 00:08:48,899
set okay I'm starting off my laptop now

202
00:08:48,899 --> 00:08:52,140
that's wrong

203
00:08:52,140 --> 00:08:54,660
I said what do you mean starting up your

204
00:08:54,660 --> 00:08:57,120
laptop you just bought it I see an order

205
00:08:57,120 --> 00:08:59,399
coming in it's paid it's done thank you

206
00:08:59,399 --> 00:09:02,459
somebody else had run a script that

207
00:09:02,459 --> 00:09:04,260
scraped the website

208
00:09:04,260 --> 00:09:06,420
and bought a bungalow within two minutes

209
00:09:06,420 --> 00:09:08,820
from the moment I open it up until a

210
00:09:08,820 --> 00:09:10,740
fully completed order so thank you for

211
00:09:10,740 --> 00:09:12,660
that I really like that people like to

212
00:09:12,660 --> 00:09:15,660
call me so much but it interrupted my

213
00:09:15,660 --> 00:09:18,380
workflow a little

214
00:09:19,200 --> 00:09:21,540
we have more sponsors I don't know where

215
00:09:21,540 --> 00:09:23,940
the slides are but uh

216
00:09:23,940 --> 00:09:27,180
I'm talking to you but you can

217
00:09:27,180 --> 00:09:29,100
see them so we have more sponsors than

218
00:09:29,100 --> 00:09:30,240
ever

219
00:09:30,240 --> 00:09:31,920
we have more value in the sponsorship

220
00:09:31,920 --> 00:09:33,420
than ever

221
00:09:33,420 --> 00:09:36,120
I will come back to that later

222
00:09:36,120 --> 00:09:38,940
we have over 40 talks and workshops and

223
00:09:38,940 --> 00:09:42,080
still growing because some workshops and

224
00:09:42,080 --> 00:09:45,420
games pop up so keep the keep an eye on

225
00:09:45,420 --> 00:09:47,719
the schedule

226
00:09:49,320 --> 00:09:51,959
this is how we've grown so we started

227
00:09:51,959 --> 00:09:54,600
somewhere 2014-15

228
00:09:54,600 --> 00:09:57,660
then in 2017 I didn't organize because

229
00:09:57,660 --> 00:10:00,120
of Shah and I thought it would disturb

230
00:10:00,120 --> 00:10:03,779
the Shah organization

231
00:10:03,779 --> 00:10:06,240
and then Stitch told me to never do that

232
00:10:06,240 --> 00:10:08,519
again and just organize

233
00:10:08,519 --> 00:10:10,560
and this is what happened and yeah we

234
00:10:10,560 --> 00:10:13,220
went up and we're now with 381

235
00:10:13,220 --> 00:10:15,540
participants which is a new record the

236
00:10:15,540 --> 00:10:17,580
last time it was three units in six so

237
00:10:17,580 --> 00:10:20,360

240

310
00:13:40,920 --> 00:13:43,620
yeah they took so much work for my hands

311
00:13:43,620 --> 00:13:46,260
that that basically was possible to do

312
00:13:46,260 --> 00:13:48,959
this and that was it was the smoothest

313
00:13:48,959 --> 00:13:51,600
hacker Hotel so far

314
00:13:51,600 --> 00:13:53,220
but there was also a very big group

315
00:13:53,220 --> 00:13:54,839
Thursday helping out

316
00:13:54,839 --> 00:13:56,639
dragging all these chairs from the other

317
00:13:56,639 --> 00:13:58,019
side of the building

318
00:13:58,019 --> 00:13:59,760
of course they were the furthest away

319
00:13:59,760 --> 00:14:01,260
and they had to go here and all the

320
00:14:01,260 --> 00:14:03,180
chairs that were here or the tables that

321
00:14:03,180 --> 00:14:04,320
were here they had to go all the way to

322
00:14:04,320 --> 00:14:06,600
the heck room so there's been some

323
00:14:06,600 --> 00:14:09,600
people really practicing out which is

324
00:14:09,600 --> 00:14:11,579
good for hackers

325
00:14:11,579 --> 00:14:14,760
and the team was we were people from UK

326

330
00:14:26,220 --> 00:14:27,779
always I try to put them somewhere in

331
00:14:27,779 --> 00:14:29,279

and keep the stuff

335
00:14:36,660 --> 00:14:38,940
in one piece so we can come back so

336
00:14:38,940 --> 00:14:41,040
first rule

337
00:14:41,040 --> 00:14:43,620
in hacking is Rule zero don't be any on

338

339
00:14:44,760 --> 00:14:47,040

um set of guidelines

402
00:17:20,040 --> 00:17:23,220
we're all adults I still believe that

403
00:17:23,220 --> 00:17:25,679
everybody can be excellent to each other

404
00:17:25,679 --> 00:17:28,079
just use common sense

405
00:17:28,079 --> 00:17:30,020
but to help you a little

406
00:17:30,020 --> 00:17:32,040
especially in the context not everybody

407
00:17:32,040 --> 00:17:34,620
is very comfortable having like Hooks

408
00:17:34,620 --> 00:17:35,760

careful if before you jump someone that

it doesn't say West Court because that

423
00:18:06,960 --> 00:18:09,900

424
00:18:09,900 --> 00:18:12,000

respect each other's privacy in this

431
00:18:26,220 --> 00:18:27,720

432
00:18:27,720 --> 00:18:30,299

please don't bring your own drinks last

438
00:18:41,160 --> 00:18:42,900
time there were people telling the

439
00:18:42,900 --> 00:18:44,160
waiter to stop

440
00:18:44,160 --> 00:18:47,100
and then they filled up their class and

441
00:18:47,100 --> 00:18:48,480
they asked for a whiskey and then they

442
00:18:48,480 --> 00:18:50,160
poured in some Coca-Cola they brought

443
00:18:50,160 --> 00:18:51,419
themselves

444
00:18:51,419 --> 00:18:53,640
so yeah that's not how it works we have

445
00:18:53,640 --> 00:18:56,700
a nice price and we had the hotel kinda

446
00:18:56,700 --> 00:18:58,679
hopes you buy the drinks there we have

447
00:18:58,679 --> 00:19:00,780
Marta so you can order Mata at the bar

448
00:19:00,780 --> 00:19:02,640
but please don't bring your own drinks

449
00:19:02,640 --> 00:19:04,980
into the bar

450
00:19:04,980 --> 00:19:06,960
The Bungalow checkout

451
00:19:06,960 --> 00:19:08,280
you can leave all your bedding in the

452
00:19:08,280 --> 00:19:09,720
hallway in the past we used to bring it

453
00:19:09,720 --> 00:19:11,820
in the hotel in big containers it's not

454
00:19:11,820 --> 00:19:13,500
needed anymore you can just leave it on

455
00:19:13,500 --> 00:19:15,000
a big pile and then the cleaning lady

456
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:18,000
will take it out so very easy to check

457
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:19,740
out just drop your bedding there and

458
00:19:19,740 --> 00:19:22,200
it's done if you need clean towels or

459
00:19:22,200 --> 00:19:23,400
whatever you can always go to the

460
00:19:23,400 --> 00:19:25,679
reception so if you want to have one or

461
00:19:25,679 --> 00:19:27,240
two or three towels a day it's no

462
00:19:27,240 --> 00:19:28,919
problem

463
00:19:28,919 --> 00:19:30,840
if you want to go into Wellness we have

464
00:19:30,840 --> 00:19:32,640
a wellness area it starts at three

465
00:19:32,640 --> 00:19:34,919
o'clock in the afternoon runs normally

466
00:19:34,919 --> 00:19:37,799
until 11 but since we're hackers it runs

467
00:19:37,799 --> 00:19:40,140
later so you can probably stay until one

468
00:19:40,140 --> 00:19:42,419
or something at night in the sauna so

469
00:19:42,419 --> 00:19:44,039
you report to the reception desk they

470
00:19:44,039 --> 00:19:45,960
give you a big towel

471
00:19:45,960 --> 00:19:47,940
normally it's 20 euros per person to use

472
00:19:47,940 --> 00:19:50,400
the wellness area but I found a very

473
00:19:50,400 --> 00:19:53,960
very friendly man

474
00:19:54,780 --> 00:19:56,460
and he's sitting here and he pays for

475
00:19:56,460 --> 00:19:59,280
all your sauna visits so use the sauna

476
00:19:59,280 --> 00:20:02,178

508
00:21:14,460 --> 00:21:16,320
the PCB and putting all the parts on it

509
00:21:16,320 --> 00:21:19,020
and the prints and stuff

510
00:21:19,020 --> 00:21:21,120
and Tom he's also here he helped a lot

511
00:21:21,120 --> 00:21:22,980
in the background and

512
00:21:22,980 --> 00:21:25,860
yeah also supported the team so and

513
00:21:25,860 --> 00:21:27,660
there was another guy but

514
00:21:27,660 --> 00:21:30,659
his name is not here but he

515
00:21:30,659 --> 00:21:33,299
sorry okay

516
00:21:33,299 --> 00:21:34,860
we'll get back to that in the backstock

517
00:21:34,860 --> 00:21:36,659
but the funny thing is two weeks after

518
00:21:36,659 --> 00:21:38,640
the last event and yes that was three

519
00:21:38,640 --> 00:21:41,640
years ago after two weeks Pym came up to

520
00:21:41,640 --> 00:21:43,860
me and he showed me a working prototype

521
00:21:43,860 --> 00:21:46,799
so two weeks after the it was a

522
00:21:46,799 --> 00:21:50,220
lighthouse and it was really cool and

523
00:21:50,220 --> 00:21:52,080
then from there it started and it

524
00:21:52,080 --> 00:21:55,580
evolved into what you have now

525
00:21:55,980 --> 00:21:57,840
normally we have the batchware shops

526
00:21:57,840 --> 00:21:59,340
there's the batch team people here they

527
00:21:59,340 --> 00:22:01,320
know how much work goes into that you

528
00:22:01,320 --> 00:22:02,760
have to flash the batch you have to

529
00:22:02,760 --> 00:22:04,559
check the batch you have to package it

530
00:22:04,559 --> 00:22:06,419
there's a sticker of a sponsor that

531
00:22:06,419 --> 00:22:07,799
needs to go in there needs to be a key

532
00:22:07,799 --> 00:22:10,140
code so it's like a long production line

533
00:22:10,140 --> 00:22:12,900
and people will yeah pack your batch and

534
00:22:12,900 --> 00:22:14,760
make it ready to hand it out to you so a

535
00:22:14,760 --> 00:22:17,820
lot of work happens in the before we can

536
00:22:17,820 --> 00:22:20,460
hand it out but this was really really

537
00:22:20,460 --> 00:22:22,380
nice because we started in bit layer

538
00:22:22,380 --> 00:22:24,720
hackerspace at two o'clock in the

539
00:22:24,720 --> 00:22:25,620
Saturday

540
00:22:25,620 --> 00:22:27,240
we had to wait before the other people

541
00:22:27,240 --> 00:22:28,080
left

542
00:22:28,080 --> 00:22:30,360
2 30 we set up shop

543
00:22:30,360 --> 00:22:32,340
three o'clock we started working at five

544
00:22:32,340 --> 00:22:35,400
o'clock everything was flashed packed

545
00:22:35,400 --> 00:22:37,740
and in the back so that was really cool

546
00:22:37,740 --> 00:22:39,179
and thank you for the people that helped

547
00:22:39,179 --> 00:22:41,220
that day but it was impressive in two

548
00:22:41,220 --> 00:22:46,080
hours 420 batches the yield was 99 so

549
00:22:46,080 --> 00:22:48,120
only four broke and we don't know if

550
00:22:48,120 --> 00:22:49,440
they can be fixed because we had enough

551
00:22:49,440 --> 00:22:51,900
so it wasn't really like oh we have to

552
00:22:51,900 --> 00:22:52,980
fix this

553
00:22:52,980 --> 00:22:56,039
but it was impressive and Sunday

554
00:22:56,039 --> 00:22:59,700
there will be a batch dog in this room

555
00:22:59,700 --> 00:23:01,320
I have three o'clock

556
00:23:01,320 --> 00:23:04,080
but I have messed up before so

557
00:23:04,080 --> 00:23:05,640
but probably three o'clock look in the

558
00:23:05,640 --> 00:23:07,799
schedule Bim will talk about the batch

559
00:23:07,799 --> 00:23:10,080
and I think uh shark and niclet will

560
00:23:10,080 --> 00:23:11,520
also join in the talk and they will tell

561
00:23:11,520 --> 00:23:14,159
about the process of making a batch like

562
00:23:14,159 --> 00:23:15,179
this

563
00:23:15,179 --> 00:23:18,140
you don't want to miss it

564
00:23:19,140 --> 00:23:21,059
there is uh there is new firmware

565
00:23:21,059 --> 00:23:23,220
available and you need it to complete

566
00:23:23,220 --> 00:23:25,260
the adventure so yes the batch is

567
00:23:25,260 --> 00:23:28,200
working it is all fine but there is new

568
00:23:28,200 --> 00:23:29,760
firmware needed and then you can

569
00:23:29,760 --> 00:23:32,640
complete the adventure an adventure yes

570
00:23:32,640 --> 00:23:34,200
an adventure and I won't tell anything

571
00:23:34,200 --> 00:23:37,919
more then it is nice for you to find out

572
00:23:37,919 --> 00:23:39,539
the batch team will be in the hardware

573
00:23:39,539 --> 00:23:41,460
hacking area that's the area on the

574
00:23:41,460 --> 00:23:43,380
other side of the hotel the big room

575
00:23:43,380 --> 00:23:45,179
and they will be on the left side if you

576
00:23:45,179 --> 00:23:46,620
enter the Hall they will be on the left

577
00:23:46,620 --> 00:23:49,260
side or they will be in the bar so find

578
00:23:49,260 --> 00:23:53,179
people of Pim is here and uh that's Pim

579
00:23:53,179 --> 00:23:55,620
sarc is there and he could let us all

580
00:23:55,620 --> 00:23:57,179
the way in the back so find one of them

581
00:23:57,179 --> 00:23:59,039
and you can always ask questions and

582
00:23:59,039 --> 00:24:00,780
maybe they can give you a hint or not

583
00:24:00,780 --> 00:24:03,500
I'm not sure

584
00:24:04,260 --> 00:24:06,059
and be careful where you put the coin

585
00:24:06,059 --> 00:24:07,740
challenge there's two prongs sticking

586
00:24:07,740 --> 00:24:10,559
out and if you jam the battery in it

587
00:24:10,559 --> 00:24:13,559
will probably die so so stick it in

588
00:24:13,559 --> 00:24:15,360
under an angle and then fold the battery

589
00:24:15,360 --> 00:24:17,460
down and then

590
00:24:17,460 --> 00:24:19,860
it it won't die

591
00:24:19,860 --> 00:24:22,799
but it is repairable

592
00:24:22,799 --> 00:24:26,940
yeah this is a story on itself the

593
00:24:26,940 --> 00:24:28,020
merchandise

594
00:24:28,020 --> 00:24:29,580
as you can see

595
00:24:29,580 --> 00:24:34,260
I'm wearing the only existing sample in

596
00:24:34,260 --> 00:24:35,460
the Netherlands

597
00:24:35,460 --> 00:24:37,620
at this moment probably

598
00:24:37,620 --> 00:24:40,080
but we have a lot of issues importing

599
00:24:40,080 --> 00:24:42,120
these from Turkey because on the box it

600
00:24:42,120 --> 00:24:44,039
says network cables and there is

601
00:24:44,039 --> 00:24:46,140
clothing in it and people got really

602
00:24:46,140 --> 00:24:48,960
nervous and there's copper in it

603
00:24:48,960 --> 00:24:51,360
so but we have an awesome new clothing

604
00:24:51,360 --> 00:24:54,179
designer people that went to MCH they

605
00:24:54,179 --> 00:24:56,280
know this designer they know this

606
00:24:56,280 --> 00:24:58,679
company is either label it's a company

607
00:24:58,679 --> 00:25:00,780
Frank and I'm really really proud that

608
00:25:00,780 --> 00:25:02,640
all the temisha brought me in contact

609
00:25:02,640 --> 00:25:03,780
with him

610
00:25:03,780 --> 00:25:05,760
because they make awesome stuff they

611
00:25:05,760 --> 00:25:07,740
have the MCH

612
00:25:07,740 --> 00:25:08,760
um

613
00:25:08,760 --> 00:25:12,059
hoodie with the different colored sleeve

614
00:25:12,059 --> 00:25:14,159
on it so I thought like wow this is cool

615
00:25:14,159 --> 00:25:16,740
and these guys can make anything so I

616
00:25:16,740 --> 00:25:18,900
want a network cable a real network

617
00:25:18,900 --> 00:25:20,340
cable

618
00:25:20,340 --> 00:25:22,559
as a court in here

619
00:25:22,559 --> 00:25:26,960
so this is one of the nice features

620
00:25:28,980 --> 00:25:31,620
this uh this velcro here

621
00:25:31,620 --> 00:25:33,960
as I always say fainy feety velcro I

622
00:25:33,960 --> 00:25:37,200
came I saw I stuck around

623
00:25:37,200 --> 00:25:39,419
but you can move this everybody will get

624
00:25:39,419 --> 00:25:42,900
the one that says visitor I think and

625
00:25:42,900 --> 00:25:44,940
then there's some place I don't know

626
00:25:44,940 --> 00:25:46,380
where but then there's also a speaker

627
00:25:46,380 --> 00:25:49,860
and there is also organization so we can

628
00:25:49,860 --> 00:25:52,740
swap this out and some sponsors already

629
00:25:52,740 --> 00:25:54,779
made their own so you can make this and

630
00:25:54,779 --> 00:25:58,620
have your own patch on here

631
00:25:58,620 --> 00:26:01,020
it's got nice woven uh

632
00:26:01,020 --> 00:26:03,360
woven bands on the side that says

633
00:26:03,360 --> 00:26:05,340
hecarotel

634
00:26:05,340 --> 00:26:07,380
and it's got really really nice details

635
00:26:07,380 --> 00:26:13,200
and it's very warm but uh it was nice so

636
00:26:13,200 --> 00:26:14,940
we have a functional pitch cable we have

637
00:26:14,940 --> 00:26:17,039
the velcro patch of anything velcro

638
00:26:17,039 --> 00:26:19,380
tester woven band

639
00:26:19,380 --> 00:26:21,360
and we had lots of issues

640
00:26:21,360 --> 00:26:23,880
it is a chance that they are

641
00:26:23,880 --> 00:26:24,720
um

642
00:26:24,720 --> 00:26:26,159
coming in

643
00:26:26,159 --> 00:26:28,080
but it's not sure at this moment and I

644
00:26:28,080 --> 00:26:30,000
wish that it looked like yes we're going

645
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:32,279
to pick them up and driving it's still

646
00:26:32,279 --> 00:26:34,679
possible but

647
00:26:34,679 --> 00:26:37,380
could be that we have to bring them in

648
00:26:37,380 --> 00:26:38,400
tomorrow

649
00:26:38,400 --> 00:26:41,159
if it doesn't work I'm very very sorry

650
00:26:41,159 --> 00:26:43,260
also the supplier they can do anything

651
00:26:43,260 --> 00:26:45,120
about it it's done it's it's ready it's

652
00:26:45,120 --> 00:26:47,159
packaged it's in boxes it is in the

653
00:26:47,159 --> 00:26:49,440
Netherlands but it needs to go to the

654
00:26:49,440 --> 00:26:51,120
office and then here

655
00:26:51,120 --> 00:26:54,240
so we are still waiting and uh yeah I

656
00:26:54,240 --> 00:26:55,080
trust

657
00:26:55,080 --> 00:26:57,360
it will be okay but I cannot promise it

658
00:26:57,360 --> 00:26:59,220
will be during this weekend

659
00:26:59,220 --> 00:27:01,380

00:27:29,460 --> 00:27:31,380
one but if you want something or you

674
00:27:31,380 --> 00:27:34,200
missed out on the first buy you can

675
00:27:34,200 --> 00:27:36,480
still buy them and I will go talk to

676
00:27:36,480 --> 00:27:38,520
Frank because there is an opportunity to

677
00:27:38,520 --> 00:27:40,980
order hoodies

678
00:27:40,980 --> 00:27:43,020
so there is an opportunity but it's not

679
00:27:43,020 --> 00:27:46,320
for everyone so it's probably 50 so we

680
00:27:46,320 --> 00:27:48,779
you go to Mozart you go to talk to Frank

681
00:27:48,779 --> 00:27:50,159
and then we can

682
00:27:50,159 --> 00:27:52,380
start taking in orders

683
00:27:52,380 --> 00:27:55,320
um I hope we can fix it again I'm slowly

684
00:27:55,320 --> 00:27:58,559
sorry that that is not here now but this

685
00:27:58,559 --> 00:28:00,659
is how it looks and I hope you bear with

686
00:28:00,659 --> 00:28:02,880
us but thank you so much then and thanks

687
00:28:02,880 --> 00:28:05,299
to Frank

688
00:28:10,919 --> 00:28:13,799
other events because you are here and

689
00:28:13,799 --> 00:28:15,120
some people are here for the first time

690
00:28:15,120 --> 00:28:16,919
they said whoa I didn't expect this this

691
00:28:16,919 --> 00:28:19,260
is cool it's fun

692
00:28:19,260 --> 00:28:19,980
um

693
00:28:19,980 --> 00:28:22,260
maybe you were a refurbish hacker most

694
00:28:22,260 --> 00:28:25,620
people want to be in a hotel and dislike

695
00:28:25,620 --> 00:28:27,059
camping but there's a lot of people that

696
00:28:27,059 --> 00:28:28,260
like camping

697
00:28:28,260 --> 00:28:30,539
and then I can really recommend

698
00:28:30,539 --> 00:28:32,700
some of the other events so if you want

699
00:28:32,700 --> 00:28:34,620
to be intense you want to be hacking

700
00:28:34,620 --> 00:28:36,299
there will be Camp Zone this year it

701
00:28:36,299 --> 00:28:37,980

Netherlands

712
00:29:00,299 --> 00:29:03,840

next to EMF with it's not this year is

714

some hacking

720
00:29:21,059 --> 00:29:22,980
sounds Dutch so I was probably in the

721
00:29:22,980 --> 00:29:24,539
Netherlands

722
00:29:24,539 --> 00:29:27,240

732
00:29:49,200 --> 00:29:51,539
it was like a vacation you were on a

733
00:29:51,539 --> 00:29:53,760
hacker camp and it's like a work in

734
00:29:53,760 --> 00:29:55,799
progress stuff is being built that the

735
00:29:55,799 --> 00:29:57,360
bar gets nicer every night there's

736
00:29:57,360 --> 00:29:59,399
lights there and every time you come

there something else has happened then

738
00:30:01,500 --> 00:30:03,240
there's a crazy Belgian guy he makes

739
00:30:03,240 --> 00:30:06,240
like a slide for adults so then the

740
00:30:06,240 --> 00:30:08,279
slide is turning into a swing and then I

741
00:30:08,279 --> 00:30:10,320
don't know if you have if he has enough

742
00:30:10,320 --> 00:30:12,059

756
00:30:43,020 --> 00:30:46,320
Germany then in between is EMF then it's

757

alternating but now it's CCT time so if

759
00:30:50,820 --> 00:30:53,399
you want to go to Germany it's where it

760
00:30:53,399 --> 00:30:55,020
all originated I think

761
00:30:55,020 --> 00:30:57,299
back in the 80s the computer Cars Club

762
00:30:57,299 --> 00:30:58,860
so

763
00:30:58,860 --> 00:31:02,100
really awesome events

764
00:31:02,100 --> 00:31:04,679
now some Short History lesson I keep it

765
00:31:04,679 --> 00:31:06,299
short

766
00:31:06,299 --> 00:31:08,039
connected Freedom Foundation that's the

767
00:31:08,039 --> 00:31:10,440
foundation where from where I organized

768
00:31:10,440 --> 00:31:13,200
hacker Hotel together with my Treasurer

769
00:31:13,200 --> 00:31:16,700
Dennis who's in the room there

770
00:31:16,740 --> 00:31:18,600
we started 20 years ago

771
00:31:18,600 --> 00:31:20,580
we were a gaming event as well we did

772
00:31:20,580 --> 00:31:23,520
land parties I worked at a bank

773
00:31:23,520 --> 00:31:26,760
they replaced the whole trading floor

774
00:31:26,760 --> 00:31:29,220
Network system which was at the time

775
00:31:29,220 --> 00:31:31,559
ethernet supports to the clients and the

776
00:31:31,559 --> 00:31:35,039
backbone was 622 megabits

777
00:31:35,039 --> 00:31:36,779
and they wanted to get rid of it after

778
00:31:36,779 --> 00:31:38,940
1.5 years they discovered that ethernet

779
00:31:38,940 --> 00:31:41,399
was the way to go so they had

780
00:31:41,399 --> 00:31:44,039
in 2003 they decided to take out that

781
00:31:44,039 --> 00:31:46,320
ATM network and they had 1 million euros

782
00:31:46,320 --> 00:31:48,360
worth of networking equipment they would

783
00:31:48,360 --> 00:31:50,640
like to give it to me

784
00:31:50,640 --> 00:31:53,039
but yeah I'm I'm a person then you have

785
00:31:53,039 --> 00:31:55,200
like tax laws and you give away a

786
00:31:55,200 --> 00:31:57,360
million euros in stuff that has not been

787
00:31:57,360 --> 00:31:59,700
deprecated enough for the company so

788
00:31:59,700 --> 00:32:01,559
it's worth something so you either have

789
00:32:01,559 --> 00:32:03,539
to sell it or you have to give it away

790
00:32:03,539 --> 00:32:05,640
to a legal entity so that's the reason

791
00:32:05,640 --> 00:32:07,380
why we started the foundation so the

792
00:32:07,380 --> 00:32:11,399
foundation got the big donation not me

793
00:32:11,399 --> 00:32:15,120
so we organized until 2016.

794
00:32:15,120 --> 00:32:17,760
in hacker Hotel yeah since we've already

795
00:32:17,760 --> 00:32:20,940
had uh experience doing events in a

796
00:32:20,940 --> 00:32:22,679
hotel doing games together

797
00:32:22,679 --> 00:32:23,820
yeah

798
00:32:23,820 --> 00:32:25,860
I cut older as well stopped playing

799
00:32:25,860 --> 00:32:27,480
games or maybe the games got more

800
00:32:27,480 --> 00:32:30,779
expensive I don't know but

801
00:32:30,779 --> 00:32:33,299
yeah I wanted to do my own Echo events

802
00:32:33,299 --> 00:32:35,100
so we started and with the experience in

803
00:32:35,100 --> 00:32:36,779
the hotels and having already the deals

804
00:32:36,779 --> 00:32:39,360
and the good prices and good pricing

805
00:32:39,360 --> 00:32:41,460
scheme we started Tech Rotel so that's a

806
00:32:41,460 --> 00:32:42,960
bit of the history

807
00:32:42,960 --> 00:32:45,480
and the cable in the hoodie it says you

808
00:32:45,480 --> 00:32:46,980
already you have to wait a little bit it

809
00:32:46,980 --> 00:32:48,720
will be okay with this cable

810
00:32:48,720 --> 00:32:51,899
this symbolizes uh the name connected

811
00:32:51,899 --> 00:32:55,140
Freedom came from that we were connected

812
00:32:55,140 --> 00:32:57,059
but we're playing by playing games and

813
00:32:57,059 --> 00:32:59,100
we were connected by the network cable

814
00:32:59,100 --> 00:33:01,140
with the games you played they varied

815
00:33:01,140 --> 00:33:03,360
from people to people so you had the

816
00:33:03,360 --> 00:33:04,799
freedom to play whatever you liked as

817
00:33:04,799 --> 00:33:06,539
long as you don't bother someone and we

818
00:33:06,539 --> 00:33:07,980
were connected so that's the name

819
00:33:07,980 --> 00:33:10,140
connected Freedom explained and the

820
00:33:10,140 --> 00:33:12,120
cable symbolizes the 20-year anniversary

821
00:33:12,120 --> 00:33:14,640
of our foundation

822
00:33:14,640 --> 00:33:15,880
so yeah

823
00:33:15,880 --> 00:33:24,389
[Applause]

824
00:33:25,260 --> 00:33:27,299

887

hacker hotel please drop in

894
00:36:27,359 --> 00:36:29,339
I will send out because this is could

895
00:36:29,339 --> 00:36:31,619
you bring it up we had had some issues

896
00:36:31,619 --> 00:36:32,820
with contact

897
00:36:32,820 --> 00:36:35,760
you will audit you get your uh your

898
00:36:35,760 --> 00:36:37,079
tickets

899
00:36:37,079 --> 00:36:39,119
you came to the hotel so probably it was

900
00:36:39,119 --> 00:36:40,920
clear enough that it was today but still

901
00:36:40,920 --> 00:36:42,839
I received some emails from people lost

902
00:36:42,839 --> 00:36:45,599
it today what you only had three years

903
00:36:45,599 --> 00:36:48,060
to realize this but that means that my

904
00:36:48,060 --> 00:36:49,800
communication can be better so we will

905
00:36:49,800 --> 00:36:52,140
work on that and I'm thinking of making

906
00:36:52,140 --> 00:36:54,240
a mailing list I know you don't like

907
00:36:54,240 --> 00:36:56,700
those I even don't use it to mirror you

908
00:36:56,700 --> 00:36:59,339
guys because you order a ticket and you

909
00:36:59,339 --> 00:37:00,900
didn't sign up for a mailing list so

910
00:37:00,900 --> 00:37:02,880
that's why I've refused using those

911
00:37:02,880 --> 00:37:05,400
email addresses as I think it should

912
00:37:05,400 --> 00:37:07,980
but there might be need we might need

913
00:37:07,980 --> 00:37:09,839
another Communication channel and I'm

914
00:37:09,839 --> 00:37:11,339
still working out so if you have any

915
00:37:11,339 --> 00:37:13,020
suggestions how we can improve on that

916
00:37:13,020 --> 00:37:15,300
I'd like to know but probably we will

917
00:37:15,300 --> 00:37:17,280
make a mailing list that you can sign up

918
00:37:17,280 --> 00:37:19,079
for I won't spam you I won't send you

919
00:37:19,079 --> 00:37:21,660
other stuff but I will send you when the

920
00:37:21,660 --> 00:37:24,060
ticket sales opens because that is very

921
00:37:24,060 --> 00:37:26,339
important we sell out in two days so if

922
00:37:26,339 --> 00:37:28,440
you miss it by two days sorry you have

923
00:37:28,440 --> 00:37:30,720
to wait two years because one year until

924
00:37:30,720 --> 00:37:32,220
the event and then hopefully you get a

925
00:37:32,220 --> 00:37:35,160
ticket for the next event

926
00:37:35,160 --> 00:37:36,720
um so if you have a mailing list and you

927
00:37:36,720 --> 00:37:38,700
sign up then you could be the first to

928
00:37:38,700 --> 00:37:41,880
buy tickets so any suggestions how to

929
00:37:41,880 --> 00:37:45,079
improve let me know

930
00:37:45,420 --> 00:37:48,020
sorry

931
00:37:48,119 --> 00:37:51,320
what about facts

932
00:37:52,260 --> 00:37:55,859
oh no I can fix you that would be nice

933
00:37:55,859 --> 00:37:57,660
you want to be faxed well maybe you make

934
00:37:57,660 --> 00:37:59,280
a mailing list or we can fix it out to

935
00:37:59,280 --> 00:38:00,119
you

936
00:38:00,119 --> 00:38:03,599
but uh yeah okay any other question here

937
00:38:03,599 --> 00:38:07,339
and uh lotto and Esther

938
00:38:07,380 --> 00:38:11,060
where do you get the badge okay

939
00:38:11,579 --> 00:38:14,160
be excellent to each other that's also

940
00:38:14,160 --> 00:38:16,140
for the crew

941
00:38:16,140 --> 00:38:18,420
okay the bench you can get if you don't

942
00:38:18,420 --> 00:38:21,420
have received your badge yet then you

943
00:38:21,420 --> 00:38:23,880
walked straight past the checking desk

944
00:38:23,880 --> 00:38:25,800
which could be possible because the

945
00:38:25,800 --> 00:38:29,099
people are here but no that's correct so

946
00:38:29,099 --> 00:38:31,560
we will be there they were on break but

947
00:38:31,560 --> 00:38:33,660
you can pick it up across the reception

948
00:38:33,660 --> 00:38:35,940
desk if you missed it out tonight we

949
00:38:35,940 --> 00:38:38,280
will probably after 12 can sort you out

950
00:38:38,280 --> 00:38:40,680
just look me up or Chantal and we'll fix

951
00:38:40,680 --> 00:38:42,960
it for you so if you haven't been able

952
00:38:42,960 --> 00:38:44,940
to check in we will sort you out but

953
00:38:44,940 --> 00:38:47,520
it's a good question and yeah also the

954
00:38:47,520 --> 00:38:49,619
crew have to work so hard so they had to

955
00:38:49,619 --> 00:38:51,300
eat so

956
00:38:51,300 --> 00:38:53,900
neck

957
00:39:00,660 --> 00:39:04,200
so it might be nice if the people who

958
00:39:04,200 --> 00:39:06,420
are standing right now there could

959
00:39:06,420 --> 00:39:08,460
change over the car or that we have some

960
00:39:08,460 --> 00:39:11,460
schedule who will charge when so that's

961
00:39:11,460 --> 00:39:13,320
where it won't be any trouble around

962
00:39:13,320 --> 00:39:16,440
that yeah as uh yes we are a very

963
00:39:16,440 --> 00:39:18,660
sustainable uh event

964
00:39:18,660 --> 00:39:20,099
I have never had to deal with this

965
00:39:20,099 --> 00:39:22,020
before but it's a good question maybe

966
00:39:22,020 --> 00:39:23,760
the people that drive electrically can

967
00:39:23,760 --> 00:39:25,500
find each other right on the board maybe

968
00:39:25,500 --> 00:39:27,300
and start some schedule

969
00:39:27,300 --> 00:39:29,339
it's a good question I don't know if I'm

970
00:39:29,339 --> 00:39:31,680
the right person to solve it I drive a

971
00:39:31,680 --> 00:39:35,000
diesel car but

972
00:39:36,300 --> 00:39:38,160
but it's a good suggestion so maybe you

973
00:39:38,160 --> 00:39:39,839
can start something on the bite board to

974
00:39:39,839 --> 00:39:41,820
flip overboard next to the bar and then

975
00:39:41,820 --> 00:39:43,619
people can yeah I don't know contact

976
00:39:43,619 --> 00:39:45,300
each other or write down where you think

977
00:39:45,300 --> 00:39:46,859
it's finished and then move the cars

978
00:39:46,859 --> 00:39:48,119
around

979
00:39:48,119 --> 00:39:50,700
so uh yeah that's better than putting a

980
00:39:50,700 --> 00:39:52,680
generator outside so

981
00:39:52,680 --> 00:39:55,700
any other questions

982
00:39:58,140 --> 00:40:02,280
so if there's no more questions then

983
00:40:02,280 --> 00:40:04,920
my friend clip is amazing and at least

984
00:40:04,920 --> 00:40:06,420
they're all dressed in yellow and uh

985
00:40:06,420 --> 00:40:09,859
yeah give it up for my fan club

986
00:40:10,619 --> 00:40:13,610
okay

987
00:40:13,610 --> 00:40:16,200
[Applause]

988
00:40:16,200 --> 00:40:17,760
there was one last question over there

989
00:40:17,760 --> 00:40:20,060
but

990
00:40:21,960 --> 00:40:24,180
there's one car allowed per Bungalow as

991
00:40:24,180 --> 00:40:26,760
I'm correct but I'm not sure if this

992
00:40:26,760 --> 00:40:28,800
um charging infrastructure and if you

993
00:40:28,800 --> 00:40:30,359
can run a cable inside I'm not sure if

994
00:40:30,359 --> 00:40:32,040
that's a lot so please use the the the

995
00:40:32,040 --> 00:40:34,500
charging

996
00:40:34,500 --> 00:40:36,060
um yeah the charging cables in the front

997
00:40:36,060 --> 00:40:38,640
of the hotel there's four positions I

998
00:40:38,640 --> 00:40:39,720
just learned

999
00:40:39,720 --> 00:40:41,520
so

1000
00:40:41,520 --> 00:40:44,640
and then now I want to finish off with

1001
00:40:44,640 --> 00:40:47,299
some wise words

1002
00:40:47,820 --> 00:40:49,859
from Ken Block can block is one of my

1003
00:40:49,859 --> 00:40:51,660
favorite Valley drivers he died last

money and lots of free time and he drove

1010
