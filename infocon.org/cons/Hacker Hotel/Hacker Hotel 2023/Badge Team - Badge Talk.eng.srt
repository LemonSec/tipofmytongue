1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,600
you I really really really like to

2
00:00:03,600 --> 00:00:06,000
announce to you that this uh this talk

3
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:08,580
will be presented by Pim

4
00:00:08,580 --> 00:00:11,820
Saka and Nicolette and I really really

5
00:00:11,820 --> 00:00:14,639
want you to give them a big hand for all

6
00:00:14,639 --> 00:00:17,010
the things they did for the batch talk

7
00:00:17,010 --> 00:00:20,769
[Applause]

8
00:00:22,500 --> 00:00:24,600
thank you very much

9
00:00:24,600 --> 00:00:26,460
so

10
00:00:26,460 --> 00:00:29,340
after three years I can finally talk

11
00:00:29,340 --> 00:00:32,060
about this batch

12
00:00:32,700 --> 00:00:36,540
so first a challenge from sebastius

13
00:00:36,540 --> 00:00:40,680
the from the last Edition the bachelor's

14
00:00:40,680 --> 00:00:42,960
team was going to be very busy with the

15
00:00:42,960 --> 00:00:44,899
MCH batch

16
00:00:44,899 --> 00:00:47,280
so they weren't going to do the next

17
00:00:47,280 --> 00:00:49,739
hacker Hotel batch

18
00:00:49,739 --> 00:00:53,340
and they were asking for a volunteer

19
00:00:53,340 --> 00:00:55,620
well I can do that

20
00:00:55,620 --> 00:00:59,100
I volunteered at the dinner and

21
00:00:59,100 --> 00:00:59,820
um

22
00:00:59,820 --> 00:01:02,520
thankfully renza said well we have a

23
00:01:02,520 --> 00:01:07,200
fallback in place if it something goes

24
00:01:07,200 --> 00:01:08,100
wrong

25
00:01:08,100 --> 00:01:10,619
so that gave me a bit of rest like okay

26
00:01:10,619 --> 00:01:13,380
this is going to be fine

27
00:01:13,380 --> 00:01:16,140
um and then we added this discussion uh

28
00:01:16,140 --> 00:01:19,619
about the batch at breakfast

29
00:01:19,619 --> 00:01:20,220
um

30
00:01:20,220 --> 00:01:24,420
where we got some requirements

31
00:01:24,420 --> 00:01:27,240
um we couldn't use any of the chips that

32
00:01:27,240 --> 00:01:30,299
were planned from the MCH batch they

33
00:01:30,299 --> 00:01:33,000
wanted to get sponsorship and we one

34
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:35,939
didn't want to cross each other trying

35
00:01:35,939 --> 00:01:37,680
to ask the same company for the same

36
00:01:37,680 --> 00:01:39,840
chips

37
00:01:39,840 --> 00:01:41,840
um we had to send you around the hotel

38
00:01:41,840 --> 00:01:45,659
because well you had to see the engineer

39
00:01:45,659 --> 00:01:48,540
studio for example that was a bit hidden

40
00:01:48,540 --> 00:01:51,360
and it had to add a game or two

41
00:01:51,360 --> 00:01:54,240
and a lesson from the last batch was

42
00:01:54,240 --> 00:01:56,340
well it would be very useful if you

43
00:01:56,340 --> 00:01:58,680
could just connect USB to it instead of

44
00:01:58,680 --> 00:02:02,100
having to use some kind of converter and

45
00:02:02,100 --> 00:02:06,000
also very important it had to be cheap

46
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:08,699
because well the meeting has to pay for

47
00:02:08,699 --> 00:02:11,299
it somehow

48
00:02:12,480 --> 00:02:15,599
we'll get to that at the end

49
00:02:15,599 --> 00:02:16,620
so

50
00:02:16,620 --> 00:02:20,099
the implementation like Dimitri said in

51
00:02:20,099 --> 00:02:21,599
the opening talk

52
00:02:21,599 --> 00:02:23,580
um I had my first prototype after two

53
00:02:23,580 --> 00:02:25,440
weeks

54
00:02:25,440 --> 00:02:29,700
um it featured a 7d11 market controller

55
00:02:29,700 --> 00:02:33,060
which is a very tiny arm microcontroller

56
00:02:33,060 --> 00:02:35,099
with integrated USB

57
00:02:35,099 --> 00:02:37,440
we had an eprom on there to store some

58
00:02:37,440 --> 00:02:41,340
State bits uh flash to store a lot of

59
00:02:41,340 --> 00:02:44,220
things in there that we could use for

60
00:02:44,220 --> 00:02:45,239
games

61
00:02:45,239 --> 00:02:48,959
a shift register to add more LEDs

62
00:02:48,959 --> 00:02:51,420
because LEDs are important

63
00:02:51,420 --> 00:02:54,959
and for communication between some kind

64
00:02:54,959 --> 00:02:57,780
of beacons or between batch batch I had

65
00:02:57,780 --> 00:03:00,959
planned to do that optically and with an

66
00:03:00,959 --> 00:03:03,540
LED and a

67
00:03:03,540 --> 00:03:06,540
photodiode

68
00:03:07,019 --> 00:03:08,040
so

69
00:03:08,040 --> 00:03:10,620
of course it doesn't go right the first

70
00:03:10,620 --> 00:03:11,580
time

71
00:03:11,580 --> 00:03:17,220
so I made an uh a second prototype

72
00:03:17,220 --> 00:03:19,080
um I had to fix some issues with thin

73
00:03:19,080 --> 00:03:22,200
outs I put the wrong thing of The Flash

74
00:03:22,200 --> 00:03:23,700
chip to the wrong PIN of the

75
00:03:23,700 --> 00:03:26,159
microcontroller

76
00:03:26,159 --> 00:03:30,360
um and we were experimenting with trying

77
00:03:30,360 --> 00:03:32,640
to program it in Rust

78
00:03:32,640 --> 00:03:35,459
but there were also some things

79
00:03:35,459 --> 00:03:37,920
happening

80
00:03:37,920 --> 00:03:41,280
so on the 27th of the February it was

81
00:03:41,280 --> 00:03:44,099
announced well we have the first case of

82
00:03:44,099 --> 00:03:46,019
Corona in the Netherlands

83
00:03:46,019 --> 00:03:49,319
and in March more and more measures were

84
00:03:49,319 --> 00:03:52,680
taken and they were the first doubts

85
00:03:52,680 --> 00:03:57,560
well could this event actually go on

86
00:03:58,260 --> 00:03:59,640
um

87
00:03:59,640 --> 00:04:01,620
it did give me a lot of time to do

88
00:04:01,620 --> 00:04:04,680
projects because I had to stay at home

89
00:04:04,680 --> 00:04:05,819
um

90
00:04:05,819 --> 00:04:07,739
so

91
00:04:07,739 --> 00:04:11,159
um I experimented with running a

92
00:04:11,159 --> 00:04:15,180
microcontroller on a coin show

93
00:04:15,180 --> 00:04:18,060
that kind of worked but the battery

94
00:04:18,060 --> 00:04:20,880
drained in like half a day

95
00:04:20,880 --> 00:04:22,199
and

96
00:04:22,199 --> 00:04:22,919
um

97
00:04:22,919 --> 00:04:24,600
if you don't haven't noticed this

98
00:04:24,600 --> 00:04:25,860
weekend

99
00:04:25,860 --> 00:04:29,780
half a day is not long enough

100
00:04:31,979 --> 00:04:34,800
um but still things weren't going that

101
00:04:34,800 --> 00:04:36,780
well in the world

102
00:04:36,780 --> 00:04:38,280
so

103
00:04:38,280 --> 00:04:44,580
on September 23rd and 6 30 PM 8 weeks

104
00:04:44,580 --> 00:04:46,979
where with great sadness it was

105
00:04:46,979 --> 00:04:48,540
announced that

106
00:04:48,540 --> 00:04:52,220
um haircut was canceled

107
00:04:52,800 --> 00:04:54,960
all right

108
00:04:54,960 --> 00:04:56,940
then

109
00:04:56,940 --> 00:05:00,479
well around July 2001

110
00:05:00,479 --> 00:05:03,240
are you still interested in doing this

111
00:05:03,240 --> 00:05:04,740
badge

112
00:05:04,740 --> 00:05:06,960
from the last time we I figured out well

113
00:05:06,960 --> 00:05:11,400
I can't really do that with A2 Man team

114
00:05:11,400 --> 00:05:14,699
um so I asked for some help

115
00:05:14,699 --> 00:05:17,820
um I asked Tom to help out with

116
00:05:17,820 --> 00:05:19,440
um getting the thing actually

117
00:05:19,440 --> 00:05:21,000
manufactured

118
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:23,360
and Nicolette

119
00:05:23,360 --> 00:05:27,060
for helping out with the artwork and

120
00:05:27,060 --> 00:05:28,160
soccer

121
00:05:28,160 --> 00:05:32,220
for helping out with the puzzles

122
00:05:32,220 --> 00:05:37,139
there was only one small issue

123
00:05:37,139 --> 00:05:40,199
a chip shortage

124
00:05:40,199 --> 00:05:43,560
I couldn't get the main chip I wanted to

125
00:05:43,560 --> 00:05:45,300
use

126
00:05:45,300 --> 00:05:47,820
um and all the other things that needed

127
00:05:47,820 --> 00:05:50,699
to go on there were also

128
00:05:50,699 --> 00:05:54,320
getting more expensive

129
00:05:54,720 --> 00:05:58,139
so we had to go looking for a new

130
00:05:58,139 --> 00:06:01,100
microcontroller

131
00:06:02,100 --> 00:06:03,139
um

132
00:06:03,139 --> 00:06:07,259
we had two basic choices

133
00:06:07,259 --> 00:06:11,160
we could either go for the RP 2040 which

134
00:06:11,160 --> 00:06:13,919
was a very brand new chip from Raspberry

135
00:06:13,919 --> 00:06:16,380
Pi Foundation

136
00:06:16,380 --> 00:06:18,600
um but it had some weird availability

137
00:06:18,600 --> 00:06:22,080
issues and it was well new so you had to

138
00:06:22,080 --> 00:06:24,600
figure out some stuff

139
00:06:24,600 --> 00:06:27,900
um we could also use the esp32 which is

140
00:06:27,900 --> 00:06:30,180
known chip

141
00:06:30,180 --> 00:06:33,120
um but isn't that energy efficient

142
00:06:33,120 --> 00:06:35,759
again we would like to have it run on a

143
00:06:35,759 --> 00:06:38,639
small battery and with this chip you

144
00:06:38,639 --> 00:06:40,440
have the same problem that you won't

145
00:06:40,440 --> 00:06:43,460
make the end of the weekend

146
00:06:43,979 --> 00:06:47,400
it was also a bit close to the infra to

147
00:06:47,400 --> 00:06:50,580
how the MCH batch worked but we could

148
00:06:50,580 --> 00:06:53,400
get 500 of them

149
00:06:53,400 --> 00:06:56,460
so I first focused on

150
00:06:56,460 --> 00:06:59,280
um seeing if I could build something

151
00:06:59,280 --> 00:07:02,940
with that rp2040

152
00:07:03,120 --> 00:07:03,720
um

153
00:07:03,720 --> 00:07:06,720
I made some boards some small a main Dev

154
00:07:06,720 --> 00:07:08,819
board and some small other boards these

155
00:07:08,819 --> 00:07:10,620
two try out

156
00:07:10,620 --> 00:07:14,100
um how this thing could work

157
00:07:14,100 --> 00:07:17,759
uh it also added a shift register again

158
00:07:17,759 --> 00:07:20,460
I tried out running it on battery again

159
00:07:20,460 --> 00:07:23,160
seeing if I could turn on

160
00:07:23,160 --> 00:07:25,620
turn it on and also have it turned off

161
00:07:25,620 --> 00:07:29,400
automatically using the chip

162
00:07:29,400 --> 00:07:30,539
um

163
00:07:30,539 --> 00:07:32,639
and it was also the first instance that

164
00:07:32,639 --> 00:07:36,360
I could collaborate with Nicolette

165
00:07:36,360 --> 00:07:39,840
um I did cause some issues

166
00:07:39,840 --> 00:07:42,599
um the shift register wasn't correct

167
00:07:42,599 --> 00:07:44,819
attached correctly so I could only get

168
00:07:44,819 --> 00:07:49,020
seven bits in there instead of eight

169
00:07:49,020 --> 00:07:51,180
um which meant that if we would have

170
00:07:51,180 --> 00:07:53,639
done that we had less

171
00:07:53,639 --> 00:07:55,919
place to put codes that we put out

172
00:07:55,919 --> 00:07:59,520
throughout the hotel and so that had to

173
00:07:59,520 --> 00:08:02,580
be fixed and we have the buttons I was

174
00:08:02,580 --> 00:08:05,699
also connecting power directly to

175
00:08:05,699 --> 00:08:08,340
outputs that could be ground so you

176
00:08:08,340 --> 00:08:10,319
would create some short

177
00:08:10,319 --> 00:08:12,060
it was also not good

178
00:08:12,060 --> 00:08:15,500
so we fixed those things

179
00:08:15,900 --> 00:08:20,220
um but first getting the rp2040

180
00:08:20,220 --> 00:08:22,800
so they were these chips were introduced

181
00:08:22,800 --> 00:08:25,020
first as a Dev board from Raspberry Pi

182
00:08:25,020 --> 00:08:27,479
themselves and that you could get for

183
00:08:27,479 --> 00:08:29,879
like three months

184
00:08:29,879 --> 00:08:33,659
then you could order individual chips

185
00:08:33,659 --> 00:08:38,458
um and then you could get rid of them

186
00:08:38,458 --> 00:08:42,059
but the delivery time of that would be

187
00:08:42,059 --> 00:08:44,880
somewhere in November December which is

188
00:08:44,880 --> 00:08:47,399
too late for this batch

189
00:08:47,399 --> 00:08:48,180
um

190
00:08:48,180 --> 00:08:50,760
so I sent an email to Raspberry Pi and

191
00:08:50,760 --> 00:08:53,339
explained what we wanted to do and they

192
00:08:53,339 --> 00:08:56,279
said well that's a cool project

193
00:08:56,279 --> 00:08:59,580
here you have a real 500 for free

194
00:08:59,580 --> 00:09:02,480
thank you

195
00:09:04,800 --> 00:09:07,500
so they sent that out and that was the

196
00:09:07,500 --> 00:09:09,660
first component that was in China at the

197
00:09:09,660 --> 00:09:12,560
6th of October

198
00:09:13,200 --> 00:09:18,019
but actually we had to design a badge

199
00:09:18,480 --> 00:09:19,260
um

200
00:09:19,260 --> 00:09:21,839
so I made the first prototype that

201
00:09:21,839 --> 00:09:24,540
included all of the components that were

202
00:09:24,540 --> 00:09:26,519
on there

203
00:09:26,519 --> 00:09:29,100
um it was very close to what you have on

204
00:09:29,100 --> 00:09:31,500
your neck right now

205
00:09:31,500 --> 00:09:35,580
um the only thing was that the battery

206
00:09:35,580 --> 00:09:38,459
circuit again didn't work

207
00:09:38,459 --> 00:09:40,980
you're sensing a theme Here

208
00:09:40,980 --> 00:09:41,760
um

209
00:09:41,760 --> 00:09:44,580
instead of half a day now it went from

210
00:09:44,580 --> 00:09:47,399
like one half day which meant that at

211
00:09:47,399 --> 00:09:50,220
Saturday your bed would die still not

212
00:09:50,220 --> 00:09:52,320
good

213
00:09:52,320 --> 00:09:54,839
so I made a new version simplified the

214
00:09:54,839 --> 00:09:57,060
battery circuit greatly

215
00:09:57,060 --> 00:09:59,119
um

216
00:09:59,339 --> 00:10:03,240
and that was this bad version

217
00:10:03,240 --> 00:10:05,220
time was starting to run out because we

218
00:10:05,220 --> 00:10:08,160
had to push everything to production

219
00:10:08,160 --> 00:10:08,880
um

220
00:10:08,880 --> 00:10:12,420
but then I got some messages like

221
00:10:12,420 --> 00:10:14,880
maybe you should put some more work into

222
00:10:14,880 --> 00:10:19,380
it we don't like what you're doing

223
00:10:19,380 --> 00:10:20,760
um

224
00:10:20,760 --> 00:10:22,380
so

225
00:10:22,380 --> 00:10:24,120
um

226
00:10:24,120 --> 00:10:26,519
we never produced this like I pressed

227
00:10:26,519 --> 00:10:28,740
order and then I pressed cancel because

228
00:10:28,740 --> 00:10:32,040
we had to do some rework on the design

229
00:10:32,040 --> 00:10:35,100
and to explain a bit more like what kind

230
00:10:35,100 --> 00:10:37,019
of all kinds of things we were doing

231
00:10:37,019 --> 00:10:39,300
with the design I would like to invite

232
00:10:39,300 --> 00:10:42,319
Nicolette on stage

233
00:10:46,260 --> 00:10:48,779
space

234
00:10:48,779 --> 00:10:52,560
working with me on a bed she's not just

235
00:10:52,560 --> 00:10:54,959
slapping uh

236
00:10:54,959 --> 00:10:58,740
raster image on it and just

237
00:10:58,740 --> 00:11:00,839
hope kaiket will actually make it work

238
00:11:00,839 --> 00:11:03,600
it's a whole bunch of conceptualization

239
00:11:03,600 --> 00:11:04,860
and

240
00:11:04,860 --> 00:11:06,779
getting to know the team if it's a new

241
00:11:06,779 --> 00:11:09,060
team as this was my first time with

242
00:11:09,060 --> 00:11:11,220
collaborating with pmos so I had to

243
00:11:11,220 --> 00:11:14,399
understand how we could work together so

244
00:11:14,399 --> 00:11:18,120
this was my apologies this was kind of a

245
00:11:18,120 --> 00:11:20,579
warm-up project he asked me to produce

246
00:11:20,579 --> 00:11:23,820
some very simple artwork for the

247
00:11:23,820 --> 00:11:26,700
the the badge when it was still in three

248
00:11:26,700 --> 00:11:28,260
modular stages

249
00:11:28,260 --> 00:11:30,660
and then we started to understand that

250
00:11:30,660 --> 00:11:33,980
we can work very well together

251
00:11:34,560 --> 00:11:36,619
um

252
00:11:36,720 --> 00:11:39,959
so how did we end up from cute cats with

253
00:11:39,959 --> 00:11:44,940
visual hearts in gravestones and such

254
00:11:44,940 --> 00:11:47,000
um

255
00:11:47,640 --> 00:11:50,480
so

256
00:11:51,480 --> 00:11:53,300
sorry

257
00:11:53,300 --> 00:11:57,180
so we were of course this had a group

258
00:11:57,180 --> 00:11:59,160
where we just discussed all kinds of the

259
00:11:59,160 --> 00:12:01,019
ideas and

260
00:12:01,019 --> 00:12:03,660
um it was still a kind of squarish

261
00:12:03,660 --> 00:12:05,160
design

262
00:12:05,160 --> 00:12:07,140
um and then you came up with the idea

263
00:12:07,140 --> 00:12:10,320
that kind of looks like a gravestone yes

264
00:12:10,320 --> 00:12:12,420
so we did find the form factor it should

265
00:12:12,420 --> 00:12:14,160
be a square

266
00:12:14,160 --> 00:12:15,899
we wanted to

267
00:12:15,899 --> 00:12:18,079
pick another adventure just as with the

268
00:12:18,079 --> 00:12:20,640
hakayota 2020 budget was an Egyptian

269
00:12:20,640 --> 00:12:23,160
team we were wondering if we should do

270
00:12:23,160 --> 00:12:24,779
another culture or we should come up

271
00:12:24,779 --> 00:12:27,120
with some other fantasy element and then

272
00:12:27,120 --> 00:12:29,579
we wanted to do something creepy

273
00:12:29,579 --> 00:12:33,420
basically so we went into this direction

274
00:12:33,420 --> 00:12:36,000
I also happened to visit delft at that

275
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:38,480
time so I could take some photos of the

276
00:12:38,480 --> 00:12:41,339
tombstones in the floor which gave me a

277
00:12:41,339 --> 00:12:43,740
lot of inspiration also

278
00:12:43,740 --> 00:12:44,700
um

279
00:12:44,700 --> 00:12:47,279
and then we started to brainstorm

280
00:12:47,279 --> 00:12:48,959
further that we actually want to do a

281
00:12:48,959 --> 00:12:51,720
badge which is also a retro computer

282
00:12:51,720 --> 00:12:54,120
merged together with something that is

283
00:12:54,120 --> 00:12:56,600
ancient

284
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:58,800
um

285
00:12:58,800 --> 00:13:01,620
and you know computers have wizards so

286
00:13:01,620 --> 00:13:04,740
it's a computer wizard it's a Merlin it

287
00:13:04,740 --> 00:13:08,040
helps you it could also not help you

288
00:13:08,040 --> 00:13:10,560
and another concept of a split

289
00:13:10,560 --> 00:13:13,200
personality artificial intelligence was

290
00:13:13,200 --> 00:13:14,760
born

291
00:13:14,760 --> 00:13:17,760
then came the first sketches we already

292
00:13:17,760 --> 00:13:20,459
had the square but we have started to

293
00:13:20,459 --> 00:13:22,680
see things where they don't belong such

294
00:13:22,680 --> 00:13:23,579
as

295
00:13:23,579 --> 00:13:26,399
in

296
00:13:26,399 --> 00:13:28,800
biscuits and that was a meme that I

297
00:13:28,800 --> 00:13:30,480
posted to the guys to the chat but that

298
00:13:30,480 --> 00:13:32,040
was very relevant to how we have been

299
00:13:32,040 --> 00:13:34,939
feeling at the time already

300
00:13:35,600 --> 00:13:38,339
so this is what we call nicolette's

301
00:13:38,339 --> 00:13:39,779
playground

302
00:13:39,779 --> 00:13:43,139
it's an empty badge which you give to me

303
00:13:43,139 --> 00:13:46,860
and you say go wild on it

304
00:13:46,860 --> 00:13:50,639
and I saw cracks in it

305
00:13:50,639 --> 00:13:52,800
and I thought okay I think I have an

306
00:13:52,800 --> 00:13:55,099
idea

307
00:13:55,260 --> 00:13:57,600
this is the first sketch

308
00:13:57,600 --> 00:14:00,300
as you see the text was placeholders I

309
00:14:00,300 --> 00:14:03,540
had an idea of what should go where I

310
00:14:03,540 --> 00:14:06,600
had no idea exactly what should it be

311
00:14:06,600 --> 00:14:11,000
but it started to take shape and

312
00:14:11,040 --> 00:14:14,240
I love to produce

313
00:14:14,240 --> 00:14:18,600
Badgers which are outside the box

314
00:14:18,600 --> 00:14:20,880
uh that means that you have to do

315
00:14:20,880 --> 00:14:22,380
interactive things with it so it's not

316
00:14:22,380 --> 00:14:24,600
just software based but you might have

317
00:14:24,600 --> 00:14:28,620
to interact with your fellow hackers or

318
00:14:28,620 --> 00:14:30,300
you have to pay attention to the corners

319
00:14:30,300 --> 00:14:31,620
you might see a picture frame it's

320
00:14:31,620 --> 00:14:33,720
something that's related to the badge

321
00:14:33,720 --> 00:14:35,639
you might have to modify the badge

322
00:14:35,639 --> 00:14:37,380
yourself

323
00:14:37,380 --> 00:14:39,540
but these might be spoilers they're not

324
00:14:39,540 --> 00:14:43,099
going too much into details with that

325
00:14:43,980 --> 00:14:47,220
this was about the last

326
00:14:47,220 --> 00:14:50,899
sketch fights really the final artwork

327
00:14:50,899 --> 00:14:54,480
so the left side is for us to to see

328
00:14:54,480 --> 00:14:56,220
that this is all we have and the right

329
00:14:56,220 --> 00:14:58,440
side is what you have on your neck

330
00:14:58,440 --> 00:15:01,680
with the puzzles missing on it because

331
00:15:01,680 --> 00:15:05,120
that's up to you to find them

332
00:15:05,399 --> 00:15:06,839
then we step on the phone the problem

333
00:15:06,839 --> 00:15:09,480
that we still didn't decide the color

334
00:15:09,480 --> 00:15:13,019
it's a stone tablet it's a gravestone

335
00:15:13,019 --> 00:15:16,680
it's a sacred tablet it could be black

336
00:15:16,680 --> 00:15:18,899
could be green because perhaps it's very

337
00:15:18,899 --> 00:15:21,899
old it oxidizes or it's full of algae or

338
00:15:21,899 --> 00:15:23,100
Moss

339
00:15:23,100 --> 00:15:27,060
or it could be lapis lazuli as you can

340
00:15:27,060 --> 00:15:30,300
produce a blue PCB with gold and white

341
00:15:30,300 --> 00:15:32,339
cell screen

342
00:15:32,339 --> 00:15:36,620
so so we just went with that

343
00:15:36,959 --> 00:15:40,380
and the first prototypes came in or idea

344
00:15:40,380 --> 00:15:44,100
of it producing cracks using the fr4 but

345
00:15:44,100 --> 00:15:46,440
ff4 is the base layer of the PCB so we

346
00:15:46,440 --> 00:15:48,300
just we could just play with that that

347
00:15:48,300 --> 00:15:50,820
we could use that as the cracks to add

348
00:15:50,820 --> 00:15:54,540
an extra Dimension to it and as Tom very

349
00:15:54,540 --> 00:15:58,320
honestly questioned what magic is

350
00:15:58,320 --> 00:15:59,760
going on here why do you have an extra

351
00:15:59,760 --> 00:16:02,639
color of green where the traditional PCB

352
00:16:02,639 --> 00:16:06,019
doesn't have that

353
00:16:06,959 --> 00:16:08,760
so if you look on your badge you can see

354
00:16:08,760 --> 00:16:11,459
that really it has it basically like we

355
00:16:11,459 --> 00:16:12,959
took a knife and we just crashed it but

356
00:16:12,959 --> 00:16:17,359
really it is manufactured like that

357
00:16:20,100 --> 00:16:22,500
I love to I love to work on badges

358
00:16:22,500 --> 00:16:24,720
because we can always make it extra

359
00:16:24,720 --> 00:16:27,180
it it doesn't just stop at being a

360
00:16:27,180 --> 00:16:30,000
boring sheet of fr4

361
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:32,160
it can be so much more

362
00:16:32,160 --> 00:16:34,199
and whoever will be in the next batch

363
00:16:34,199 --> 00:16:35,519
team I will work with I'm looking

364
00:16:35,519 --> 00:16:37,380
forward to looking forward to working

365
00:16:37,380 --> 00:16:38,579
with you

366
00:16:38,579 --> 00:16:40,560
so

367
00:16:40,560 --> 00:16:43,920
okay so and then you get a whole bunch

368
00:16:43,920 --> 00:16:46,980
of files from Nicolette and um

369
00:16:46,980 --> 00:16:49,800
you have to incorporate that into your

370
00:16:49,800 --> 00:16:51,660
design

371
00:16:51,660 --> 00:16:54,959
um of course she did okay she did a

372
00:16:54,959 --> 00:16:57,120
great job of delivering those files and

373
00:16:57,120 --> 00:17:00,000
but I had a problem with the copper

374
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:02,759
layer that I would really like to check

375
00:17:02,759 --> 00:17:07,919
if the continuity to it was correct so

376
00:17:07,919 --> 00:17:11,520
then in kaikat I had to trace all of the

377
00:17:11,520 --> 00:17:14,880
cracks and make sure that it was the

378
00:17:14,880 --> 00:17:17,339
design will check because then you know

379
00:17:17,339 --> 00:17:19,619
for sure that the batch will work if you

380
00:17:19,619 --> 00:17:23,939
send it out and not well

381
00:17:23,939 --> 00:17:27,959
um so batches were ready for production

382
00:17:27,959 --> 00:17:29,820
um

383
00:17:29,820 --> 00:17:32,340
the communication with allnet or

384
00:17:32,340 --> 00:17:35,160
producer started like how much is it's

385
00:17:35,160 --> 00:17:37,500
going to cost and what kind of deadlines

386
00:17:37,500 --> 00:17:41,640
do we have and the final deadline was

387
00:17:41,640 --> 00:17:44,880
the 18th of December

388
00:17:44,880 --> 00:17:47,940
um I sent an email to Dimitri with hi

389
00:17:47,940 --> 00:17:50,220
Dimitri we're about to spend a lot of

390
00:17:50,220 --> 00:17:51,120
money

391
00:17:51,120 --> 00:17:54,780
do you still want to continue and then I

392
00:17:54,780 --> 00:17:56,460
got a Nemo back with

393
00:17:56,460 --> 00:18:00,240
I have some doubts what do you think

394
00:18:00,240 --> 00:18:03,840
and then I send an email back with I'm

395
00:18:03,840 --> 00:18:06,720
not seeing it as well

396
00:18:06,720 --> 00:18:08,640
and then um

397
00:18:08,640 --> 00:18:13,980
we decided we put it on holds and we'll

398
00:18:13,980 --> 00:18:16,740
decide right around the 18th of December

399
00:18:16,740 --> 00:18:18,780
you first needed to talk to some other

400
00:18:18,780 --> 00:18:23,000
people and what you thought about it

401
00:18:23,100 --> 00:18:27,320
and then on the 17th of December 5 PM

402
00:18:27,320 --> 00:18:30,059
another tweet

403
00:18:30,059 --> 00:18:32,760
another edition of record they all sadly

404
00:18:32,760 --> 00:18:35,179
canceled

405
00:18:35,400 --> 00:18:37,520
um

406
00:18:38,039 --> 00:18:41,820
so we still did a bit of work

407
00:18:41,820 --> 00:18:42,840
um

408
00:18:42,840 --> 00:18:45,299
we just send out the files that we had

409
00:18:45,299 --> 00:18:47,039
ready for production

410
00:18:47,039 --> 00:18:47,640
um

411
00:18:47,640 --> 00:18:50,400
again out for prototyping and we made a

412
00:18:50,400 --> 00:18:53,400
black version of the batch

413
00:18:53,400 --> 00:18:55,679
this was intended to be used for

414
00:18:55,679 --> 00:18:58,500
software development in the upcoming

415
00:18:58,500 --> 00:19:01,140
year and also a bit as a thank you for

416
00:19:01,140 --> 00:19:03,960
people that worked really hard on

417
00:19:03,960 --> 00:19:06,900
aspects of the batch to give them

418
00:19:06,900 --> 00:19:09,000
something special not a lot of people

419
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:11,419
had

420
00:19:11,580 --> 00:19:12,240
um

421
00:19:12,240 --> 00:19:15,000
but yeah then the project kind of

422
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:17,360
stopped

423
00:19:17,940 --> 00:19:19,260
so

424
00:19:19,260 --> 00:19:21,299
the next attempt

425
00:19:21,299 --> 00:19:24,720
we shelf the project into MGH

426
00:19:24,720 --> 00:19:27,120
but there were some still some things

427
00:19:27,120 --> 00:19:29,400
that were happening with these things we

428
00:19:29,400 --> 00:19:31,020
did

429
00:19:31,020 --> 00:19:33,360
um the RP 2040

430
00:19:33,360 --> 00:19:35,580
um looked very interesting and some

431
00:19:35,580 --> 00:19:37,620
people rancid

432
00:19:37,620 --> 00:19:41,039
um was actually very interested in how

433
00:19:41,039 --> 00:19:43,500
did we get the chips and could we use

434
00:19:43,500 --> 00:19:47,100
that for our bets because they had an

435
00:19:47,100 --> 00:19:50,640
scm-32 on there which was also not

436
00:19:50,640 --> 00:19:52,740
available

437
00:19:52,740 --> 00:19:55,400
so we brought them into contact and then

438
00:19:55,400 --> 00:19:58,740
renza took it further and made sure that

439
00:19:58,740 --> 00:20:01,620
you had also had an RP 2040 on your MCH

440
00:20:01,620 --> 00:20:03,539
badge

441
00:20:03,539 --> 00:20:06,000
um I also got a request from Tom because

442
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:07,679
he already knew that I knew something

443
00:20:07,679 --> 00:20:10,320
about RP 2040s

444
00:20:10,320 --> 00:20:15,179
um to use it in another batch and so I

445
00:20:15,179 --> 00:20:18,059
had some spare time and I thought well

446
00:20:18,059 --> 00:20:20,039
that would be nice so I made a deaf

447
00:20:20,039 --> 00:20:22,740
board on the left

448
00:20:22,740 --> 00:20:26,400
um and uh Nicolette and Tom turn it into

449
00:20:26,400 --> 00:20:28,740
the batch in the middle

450
00:20:28,740 --> 00:20:31,460
so all the effort we did in

451
00:20:31,460 --> 00:20:35,940
2021 wasn't actually for nothing

452
00:20:35,940 --> 00:20:37,860
um there were still some design elements

453
00:20:37,860 --> 00:20:41,520
that could be used for other badges

454
00:20:41,520 --> 00:20:42,480
um

455
00:20:42,480 --> 00:20:43,740
but then

456
00:20:43,740 --> 00:20:44,460
um

457
00:20:44,460 --> 00:20:48,200
we got another email from nimi of course

458
00:20:48,200 --> 00:20:51,660
that we're going to really have this

459
00:20:51,660 --> 00:20:53,460
event

460
00:20:53,460 --> 00:20:54,419
um

461
00:20:54,419 --> 00:20:56,940
so we made the last prototype send it

462
00:20:56,940 --> 00:20:58,919
out with uh

463
00:20:58,919 --> 00:21:01,620
the exact specifications as we wanted to

464
00:21:01,620 --> 00:21:05,580
build because in the previous prototypes

465
00:21:05,580 --> 00:21:09,179
um I added a bit larger chips and stuff

466
00:21:09,179 --> 00:21:11,160
um just to make sure that we could

467
00:21:11,160 --> 00:21:13,919
develop something but this is really the

468
00:21:13,919 --> 00:21:17,700
one that we intended to produce

469
00:21:17,700 --> 00:21:20,100
um we sent again production files in the

470
00:21:20,100 --> 00:21:23,160
bill of materials to own it and we had

471
00:21:23,160 --> 00:21:25,320
to do that early because Chinese new

472
00:21:25,320 --> 00:21:26,580
year was early

473
00:21:26,580 --> 00:21:29,400
like in 2021 it was nicely planned

474
00:21:29,400 --> 00:21:32,400
around hacker Hotel so you had a lot of

475
00:21:32,400 --> 00:21:35,340
time and this time it was the 22nd of

476
00:21:35,340 --> 00:21:37,620
January so we had to rush

477
00:21:37,620 --> 00:21:39,600
of course yet all the design files ready

478
00:21:39,600 --> 00:21:41,760
from the previous year so

479
00:21:41,760 --> 00:21:45,020
that was manageable

480
00:21:47,400 --> 00:21:50,460
prediction was running smoothly and we

481
00:21:50,460 --> 00:21:52,380
started the 7th of December

482
00:21:52,380 --> 00:21:54,900
I made some test procedures to make sure

483
00:21:54,900 --> 00:21:57,720
that once the wedges were made that they

484
00:21:57,720 --> 00:22:00,000
could test them in China see if they

485
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:01,140
worked

486
00:22:01,140 --> 00:22:03,179
it was a small issue with a diode

487
00:22:03,179 --> 00:22:05,640
footprint I put the wrong one component

488
00:22:05,640 --> 00:22:07,799
on there so

489
00:22:07,799 --> 00:22:08,760
um

490
00:22:08,760 --> 00:22:11,460
I got an email like well

491
00:22:11,460 --> 00:22:14,700
um they can hand solder it on there okay

492
00:22:14,700 --> 00:22:18,120
that's a bit of bummer but fine

493
00:22:18,120 --> 00:22:22,740
and then on the 28th of December 9 47

494
00:22:22,740 --> 00:22:25,500
a.m I got an email

495
00:22:25,500 --> 00:22:28,080
their batches are done

496
00:22:28,080 --> 00:22:30,918
they don't work

497
00:22:34,140 --> 00:22:34,980
um

498
00:22:34,980 --> 00:22:38,220
that was an ocean moment

499
00:22:38,220 --> 00:22:40,020
um we did some we tried to do some

500
00:22:40,020 --> 00:22:42,360
remote debugging have you tried this if

501
00:22:42,360 --> 00:22:45,120
you press these buttons what could be

502
00:22:45,120 --> 00:22:48,780
happening we've got pictures back they

503
00:22:48,780 --> 00:22:51,299
looked fine like they look exactly the

504
00:22:51,299 --> 00:22:53,820
same as your badge

505
00:22:53,820 --> 00:22:56,460
um we had some context clues that things

506
00:22:56,460 --> 00:22:59,159
were kind of working like the Buddha

507
00:22:59,159 --> 00:23:02,220
rebooted so that was a good sign

508
00:23:02,220 --> 00:23:04,500
um but we couldn't figure it out

509
00:23:04,500 --> 00:23:06,980
so we had 10 samples shipped to my house

510
00:23:06,980 --> 00:23:10,320
like we can figure this out you go look

511
00:23:10,320 --> 00:23:12,620
at it

512
00:23:12,720 --> 00:23:14,940
um that was a very long week because

513
00:23:14,940 --> 00:23:17,460
shipping things over New Year's takes

514
00:23:17,460 --> 00:23:19,620
longer

515
00:23:19,620 --> 00:23:20,280
um

516
00:23:20,280 --> 00:23:23,460
but yeah once I got them it was plugging

517
00:23:23,460 --> 00:23:24,299
it in

518
00:23:24,299 --> 00:23:27,559
yes it's broken

519
00:23:27,600 --> 00:23:28,440
um

520
00:23:28,440 --> 00:23:30,840
and then the debugging started

521
00:23:30,840 --> 00:23:34,260
the crystal was fine and I could run a

522
00:23:34,260 --> 00:23:37,620
program that I loaded into RAM so the

523
00:23:37,620 --> 00:23:41,880
whole circuit was working but for some

524
00:23:41,880 --> 00:23:44,220
reason you couldn't get anything in to

525
00:23:44,220 --> 00:23:46,919
flash I tried swapping out the flat ship

526
00:23:46,919 --> 00:23:49,679
and then the batch started up and worked

527
00:23:49,679 --> 00:23:51,600
as intended

528
00:23:51,600 --> 00:23:54,620
that was weird

529
00:23:55,080 --> 00:23:55,799
um

530
00:23:55,799 --> 00:23:58,740
item to flash and then I found strings

531
00:23:58,740 --> 00:24:00,480
in the flesh

532
00:24:00,480 --> 00:24:02,640
that shouldn't happen because when you

533
00:24:02,640 --> 00:24:06,600
get new Flash ships they should be empty

534
00:24:06,600 --> 00:24:09,360
um we tried looking into resetting the

535
00:24:09,360 --> 00:24:12,960
status bits and Diving deep into how to

536
00:24:12,960 --> 00:24:15,000
communicate to the flagship that sold it

537
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:18,059
on the board using the rp2040

538
00:24:18,059 --> 00:24:19,140
um

539
00:24:19,140 --> 00:24:22,559
and we found out yeah there were some

540
00:24:22,559 --> 00:24:25,380
non-volatile bits in there that were set

541
00:24:25,380 --> 00:24:28,919
so you it was read only and then we

542
00:24:28,919 --> 00:24:32,039
looked at one important bit for locking

543
00:24:32,039 --> 00:24:35,400
the status registers and that was set

544
00:24:35,400 --> 00:24:39,480
that meant that these chips would never

545
00:24:39,480 --> 00:24:43,220
be able to receive firmware

546
00:24:43,940 --> 00:24:48,080
that was a really big problem

547
00:24:48,780 --> 00:24:49,740
um

548
00:24:49,740 --> 00:24:52,860
so we were assuming that we had to do a

549
00:24:52,860 --> 00:24:54,780
sweatshop in the Netherlands

550
00:24:54,780 --> 00:24:57,419
like get the badges over here get 500

551
00:24:57,419 --> 00:25:01,380
Flash chips and then add bitter uh

552
00:25:01,380 --> 00:25:04,799
get them off put the new one on

553
00:25:04,799 --> 00:25:07,620
um but thankfully Norbert and allnet

554
00:25:07,620 --> 00:25:09,659
came up with a plan

555
00:25:09,659 --> 00:25:13,380
they would order chips samples see if

556
00:25:13,380 --> 00:25:15,919
they worked and then

557
00:25:15,919 --> 00:25:18,860
at lining speeds

558
00:25:18,860 --> 00:25:22,500
replace all the flash chips

559
00:25:22,500 --> 00:25:25,140
then suddenly on Monday I've got texts

560
00:25:25,140 --> 00:25:29,580
from FedEx there is a package under a

561
00:25:29,580 --> 00:25:32,400
um they were very quick

562
00:25:32,400 --> 00:25:34,320
um and all of the badges were reworked

563
00:25:34,320 --> 00:25:36,179
in China

564
00:25:36,179 --> 00:25:38,220
um we received them and then I spent the

565
00:25:38,220 --> 00:25:41,100
day at an afternoon at bit like he's

566
00:25:41,100 --> 00:25:43,799
trying out batches to see if everything

567
00:25:43,799 --> 00:25:46,080
went fine

568
00:25:46,080 --> 00:25:46,860
um

569
00:25:46,860 --> 00:25:49,440
that was the case

570
00:25:49,440 --> 00:25:52,760
um so we could relax a bit and start

571
00:25:52,760 --> 00:25:57,620
with figuring out the other bits

572
00:25:57,799 --> 00:26:00,179
why is there now

573
00:26:00,179 --> 00:26:03,140
oh no

574
00:26:03,260 --> 00:26:06,480
the demo factor is there but it's very

575
00:26:06,480 --> 00:26:08,960
small

576
00:26:10,380 --> 00:26:13,159
yes

577
00:26:13,220 --> 00:26:16,520
uh God

578
00:26:19,260 --> 00:26:22,020
how are we going to fix this can I just

579
00:26:22,020 --> 00:26:24,659
show this another way

580
00:26:24,659 --> 00:26:26,760
something has to go wrong in this

581
00:26:26,760 --> 00:26:28,080
project

582
00:26:28,080 --> 00:26:30,799
no

583
00:26:32,340 --> 00:26:34,080
and now you're seeing nothing that's

584
00:26:34,080 --> 00:26:36,320
good

585
00:26:44,039 --> 00:26:45,779
to watch the badge so now we have to

586
00:26:45,779 --> 00:26:49,279
punch the presentation so

587
00:26:49,279 --> 00:26:51,720
life on stage

588
00:26:51,720 --> 00:26:54,299
here we go that's the one you wanted

589
00:26:54,299 --> 00:26:56,340
we'll do it like this for now and then

590
00:26:56,340 --> 00:26:58,939
we'll fix it

591
00:27:00,679 --> 00:27:04,700
I'm not sure oh God

592
00:27:05,039 --> 00:27:07,080
yes this

593
00:27:07,080 --> 00:27:09,539
I'm glad this is the biggest thing

594
00:27:09,539 --> 00:27:11,580
that's going on right now

595
00:27:11,580 --> 00:27:14,299
really

596
00:27:19,039 --> 00:27:22,380
and how does this works

597
00:27:22,380 --> 00:27:24,559
start from currents

598
00:27:24,559 --> 00:27:27,980
uh I'm sorry

599
00:27:29,820 --> 00:27:32,960
no you will

600
00:27:33,539 --> 00:27:36,480
you will have to tell it I'm sorry

601
00:27:36,480 --> 00:27:38,520
okay but you could get a glimpse of what

602
00:27:38,520 --> 00:27:42,059
I'm going to talk about while pin was

603
00:27:42,059 --> 00:27:44,039
desperately trying to make everything to

604
00:27:44,039 --> 00:27:47,220
work we agreed to also continue

605
00:27:47,220 --> 00:27:49,860
splitting the tasks and Sakai will talk

606
00:27:49,860 --> 00:27:51,840
about his part of of the puzzles and how

607
00:27:51,840 --> 00:27:53,880
he's implementing it

608
00:27:53,880 --> 00:27:56,640
um in the meantime I was setting up the

609
00:27:56,640 --> 00:27:59,159
story concept and writing as much

610
00:27:59,159 --> 00:28:01,799
details as I could think of that I will

611
00:28:01,799 --> 00:28:04,559
give this cycle later on so he could

612
00:28:04,559 --> 00:28:07,020
make something amazing out of it the

613
00:28:07,020 --> 00:28:09,419
evil game that you're trying to solve is

614
00:28:09,419 --> 00:28:11,700
is his work

615
00:28:11,700 --> 00:28:13,440
but it was teamwork so you can also

616
00:28:13,440 --> 00:28:16,760
blame me if you find it too hard

617
00:28:17,100 --> 00:28:18,720
um

618
00:28:18,720 --> 00:28:21,000
as I was feeling about this document I

619
00:28:21,000 --> 00:28:24,480
put over the the main character the

620
00:28:24,480 --> 00:28:26,279
spirit which you can see on your badge

621
00:28:26,279 --> 00:28:29,580
right here underneath I put the company

622
00:28:29,580 --> 00:28:32,580
logo and underneath I put the the text

623
00:28:32,580 --> 00:28:33,900
which you can also see on the badge and

624
00:28:33,900 --> 00:28:35,640
it started to become really clear that

625
00:28:35,640 --> 00:28:36,720
okay

626
00:28:36,720 --> 00:28:39,659
this is a real flashy concept this is

627
00:28:39,659 --> 00:28:42,419
going to be amazing but we need a few

628
00:28:42,419 --> 00:28:44,940
more bits such as the lanyard we need a

629
00:28:44,940 --> 00:28:47,640
some packaging we need some stickers for

630
00:28:47,640 --> 00:28:50,100
it and we need to complete the badge

631
00:28:50,100 --> 00:28:52,200
because it's still missing like half of

632
00:28:52,200 --> 00:28:54,260
it

633
00:28:54,260 --> 00:28:57,480
the sticker that we use to seal the bags

634
00:28:57,480 --> 00:29:00,539
was inspired from atomic bomb restricted

635
00:29:00,539 --> 00:29:01,500
data

636
00:29:01,500 --> 00:29:03,000
stamps

637
00:29:03,000 --> 00:29:06,240
Rewritten to our own concept and the

638
00:29:06,240 --> 00:29:08,400
lanyard was inspired from punch trips

639
00:29:08,400 --> 00:29:10,980
which was what was what were used for

640
00:29:10,980 --> 00:29:12,960
these retro computers that we also tried

641
00:29:12,960 --> 00:29:17,419
to put into the badge that you have

642
00:29:17,640 --> 00:29:19,620
trying to nail the colors on the screen

643
00:29:19,620 --> 00:29:21,960
that possibly might have been close to

644
00:29:21,960 --> 00:29:25,220
these punch strips was

645
00:29:26,100 --> 00:29:28,260
research but not a type of research I'm

646
00:29:28,260 --> 00:29:30,240
used to because I had to look at not

647
00:29:30,240 --> 00:29:33,059
ancient cultures but instead retro

648
00:29:33,059 --> 00:29:35,399
computers from the past Century that was

649
00:29:35,399 --> 00:29:38,520
exciting for me something new

650
00:29:38,520 --> 00:29:40,980
and as I said the half of the badge was

651
00:29:40,980 --> 00:29:42,840
still missing so

652
00:29:42,840 --> 00:29:45,299
we I have to produce that so you can

653
00:29:45,299 --> 00:29:48,240
actually finish the game I took an SVG

654
00:29:48,240 --> 00:29:50,480
and executed in a 3D modeling software

655
00:29:50,480 --> 00:29:54,240
printed it and after verifying that it

656
00:29:54,240 --> 00:29:56,760
all fit together perfectly smoothly

657
00:29:56,760 --> 00:30:01,100
then I went on to colorize it

658
00:30:01,100 --> 00:30:05,220
make it as close to this imitated lapis

659
00:30:05,220 --> 00:30:08,520
lazuli as we got on the pcbs as I could

660
00:30:08,520 --> 00:30:10,320
and uh

661
00:30:10,320 --> 00:30:13,740
the result is it was quite convincing so

662
00:30:13,740 --> 00:30:16,919
we decided to put it up and you can find

663
00:30:16,919 --> 00:30:18,360
it still in the corridors if you still

664
00:30:18,360 --> 00:30:21,299
haven't looked at it it's close to

665
00:30:21,299 --> 00:30:22,559
reception

666
00:30:22,559 --> 00:30:25,820
be sure to check it out

667
00:30:26,880 --> 00:30:29,340
now the game doesn't actually end at the

668
00:30:29,340 --> 00:30:31,080
end

669
00:30:31,080 --> 00:30:32,640
because

670
00:30:32,640 --> 00:30:33,240
um

671
00:30:33,240 --> 00:30:36,480
there are two endings depending on how

672
00:30:36,480 --> 00:30:37,679
you solve it

673
00:30:37,679 --> 00:30:40,559
one of the endings will make you come to

674
00:30:40,559 --> 00:30:42,600
find a priestess with the lapis lazuli

675
00:30:42,600 --> 00:30:45,899
necklace and you would be given a stone

676
00:30:45,899 --> 00:30:48,059
manifestation of yourself as a token of

677
00:30:48,059 --> 00:30:50,580
a Memento that you attended this event

678
00:30:50,580 --> 00:30:52,140
and you actually finish the batch while

679
00:30:52,140 --> 00:30:54,659
you were here

680
00:30:54,659 --> 00:30:56,399
um

681
00:30:56,399 --> 00:31:00,240
yeah the our first finishers were

682
00:31:00,240 --> 00:31:02,640
quite unsurprisingly from the original

683
00:31:02,640 --> 00:31:05,419
batch team

684
00:31:06,179 --> 00:31:08,640
it was so satisfying to see so we were

685
00:31:08,640 --> 00:31:10,140
sitting next to each other with sake

686
00:31:10,140 --> 00:31:12,779
watching these three guys

687
00:31:12,779 --> 00:31:14,880
be so busy we knew exactly where they

688
00:31:14,880 --> 00:31:17,760
were in in the story busy being focused

689
00:31:17,760 --> 00:31:19,679
and we were like what is taking them so

690
00:31:19,679 --> 00:31:21,960
long they were supposed to already solve

691
00:31:21,960 --> 00:31:24,840
it and then then they were looking at me

692
00:31:24,840 --> 00:31:27,179
they looked back they looked at me and

693
00:31:27,179 --> 00:31:31,039
we knew they solved it and the right way

694
00:31:33,779 --> 00:31:35,820
as a special thank you I would like to

695
00:31:35,820 --> 00:31:37,919
mention that without my plants and

696
00:31:37,919 --> 00:31:41,100
animals freelancing at home is would not

697
00:31:41,100 --> 00:31:44,220
be as smooth as it is so

698
00:31:44,220 --> 00:31:47,300
thank you I love you

699
00:31:47,300 --> 00:31:52,799
[Applause]

700
00:31:52,799 --> 00:31:55,279
second

701
00:31:55,500 --> 00:31:59,220
yeah number two okay

702
00:31:59,220 --> 00:32:02,159
um yeah that's together with Nicolette

703
00:32:02,159 --> 00:32:04,200
and there are team members of the bets

704
00:32:04,200 --> 00:32:06,120
team in 2020 and it was a really

705
00:32:06,120 --> 00:32:07,559
stressful period and getting everything

706
00:32:07,559 --> 00:32:10,679
done so when we had a talk about okay

707
00:32:10,679 --> 00:32:12,600
maybe we can do MGA specifies like oh no

708
00:32:12,600 --> 00:32:13,860
not again

709
00:32:13,860 --> 00:32:16,700
and then of course again

710
00:32:16,700 --> 00:32:21,059
so I talked to Dimitri and uh he sent me

711
00:32:21,059 --> 00:32:22,440
a message like hey can you can you help

712
00:32:22,440 --> 00:32:25,320
out in the quick well of course I can

713
00:32:25,320 --> 00:32:27,360
um so we started having ideas about so

714
00:32:27,360 --> 00:32:28,740
we're going we're backtracking a little

715
00:32:28,740 --> 00:32:33,000
bit like this is again uh in 2021 when I

716
00:32:33,000 --> 00:32:34,880
was started to get involved like we were

717
00:32:34,880 --> 00:32:37,740
investigating ideas on on retro

718
00:32:37,740 --> 00:32:39,600
Computing because yeah we already had

719
00:32:39,600 --> 00:32:41,640
IID and we really wanted to have like a

720
00:32:41,640 --> 00:32:43,140
retro computer like an Altair or

721
00:32:43,140 --> 00:32:45,720
something like that similar to that on

722
00:32:45,720 --> 00:32:47,340
the batch

723
00:32:47,340 --> 00:32:49,919
um Bim already had some shift register I

724
00:32:49,919 --> 00:32:52,020
think he's built so and I wanted to have

725
00:32:52,020 --> 00:32:54,840
the Altair thing and in the end you see

726
00:32:54,840 --> 00:32:57,600
that it's actually combined on the batch

727
00:32:57,600 --> 00:32:59,399
so we couldn't make a decision we just

728
00:32:59,399 --> 00:33:01,500
use both

729
00:33:01,500 --> 00:33:04,220
um as Pam said before there's a

730
00:33:04,220 --> 00:33:07,020
develop development board so the the

731
00:33:07,020 --> 00:33:09,000
group started and we started discussing

732
00:33:09,000 --> 00:33:11,100
things and of course I needed something

733
00:33:11,100 --> 00:33:12,720
to build a game with and a game without

734
00:33:12,720 --> 00:33:14,820
the state is nothing and the RP 2040

735
00:33:14,820 --> 00:33:17,700
doesn't have any eprom so uh I said well

736
00:33:17,700 --> 00:33:19,860
do we have money for eproms okay emo

737
00:33:19,860 --> 00:33:22,679
eproms are added so I could maintain

738
00:33:22,679 --> 00:33:24,419
game stage I mean I could really build a

739
00:33:24,419 --> 00:33:26,039
game

740
00:33:26,039 --> 00:33:27,240
um

741
00:33:27,240 --> 00:33:29,539
let's see

742
00:33:29,539 --> 00:33:32,399
yeah so we started basically we started

743
00:33:32,399 --> 00:33:34,980
out okay let's let's make a retro

744
00:33:34,980 --> 00:33:36,480
computer with instructions to really

745
00:33:36,480 --> 00:33:39,539
make it work and then I have some AI

746
00:33:39,539 --> 00:33:41,700
that you talk to on the batch with it

747
00:33:41,700 --> 00:33:43,740
with that code and have have to find

748
00:33:43,740 --> 00:33:45,720
other people to to combine modules or

749
00:33:45,720 --> 00:33:47,399
stuff like that really into the Retro

750
00:33:47,399 --> 00:33:48,840
Computing thing

751
00:33:48,840 --> 00:33:50,940
but that's just a whole bunch of work

752
00:33:50,940 --> 00:33:53,880
and and probably not going to happen so

753
00:33:53,880 --> 00:33:56,039
um we parked it for a minute especially

754
00:33:56,039 --> 00:33:58,679
also because covet happened of course

755
00:33:58,679 --> 00:33:59,580
um

756
00:33:59,580 --> 00:34:03,179
so one of the the requirements from Demi

757
00:34:03,179 --> 00:34:04,740
was to have people walk around the hotel

758
00:34:04,740 --> 00:34:06,600
and see where all the others were so

759
00:34:06,600 --> 00:34:09,899
that was put in the game IDs we have we

760
00:34:09,899 --> 00:34:11,099
of course needed to do something with

761
00:34:11,099 --> 00:34:14,339
the lanyard again uh the pistol uh I

762
00:34:14,339 --> 00:34:16,619
wanted to have a pistol on the game or

763
00:34:16,619 --> 00:34:18,300
sorry on the batch that people could use

764
00:34:18,300 --> 00:34:20,099
in the spare time work on the batch

765
00:34:20,099 --> 00:34:22,679
itself to to do pesos and of course we

766
00:34:22,679 --> 00:34:24,300
needed an adventure at least that's what

767
00:34:24,300 --> 00:34:25,918
I thought

768
00:34:25,918 --> 00:34:27,780
um and for me a batch is also about

769
00:34:27,780 --> 00:34:29,940
communication about meeting people about

770
00:34:29,940 --> 00:34:31,739
working together so there needed to be

771
00:34:31,739 --> 00:34:33,179
something that you needed to do together

772
00:34:33,179 --> 00:34:35,399
again on this batch a couple of the

773
00:34:35,399 --> 00:34:37,918
ideas that resembled what we did three

774
00:34:37,918 --> 00:34:39,359
years earlier but still I think those

775
00:34:39,359 --> 00:34:41,639
are important elements

776
00:34:41,639 --> 00:34:42,599
um

777
00:34:42,599 --> 00:34:45,000
so the old computer was there we had

778
00:34:45,000 --> 00:34:46,980
some Spirit thingies like okay what

779
00:34:46,980 --> 00:34:49,619
happens if we just make it that the good

780
00:34:49,619 --> 00:34:51,719
spirit or the AI turns bad and turns on

781
00:34:51,719 --> 00:34:54,060
to you and yeah that got us started to

782
00:34:54,060 --> 00:34:57,180
the whole uh ID of the game

783
00:34:57,180 --> 00:34:58,200
um

784
00:34:58,200 --> 00:34:59,940
and of course you want to do something

785
00:34:59,940 --> 00:35:01,740
nice with web USB maybe something

786
00:35:01,740 --> 00:35:03,960
graphical but yeah then we needed to

787
00:35:03,960 --> 00:35:05,880
have more people working on it and

788
00:35:05,880 --> 00:35:08,520
that's a lot of coding so I built this

789
00:35:08,520 --> 00:35:12,180
game engine in in 2020 that if you were

790
00:35:12,180 --> 00:35:14,280
there and present about it earlier as

791
00:35:14,280 --> 00:35:15,359
well

792
00:35:15,359 --> 00:35:17,880
um so we decided why not use that and

793
00:35:17,880 --> 00:35:20,040
just create the content and not spend

794
00:35:20,040 --> 00:35:22,619
time on the programming

795
00:35:22,619 --> 00:35:25,500
of course being me everything goes on on

796
00:35:25,500 --> 00:35:28,079
the right the right time which is my the

797
00:35:28,079 --> 00:35:30,240
world is just in time

798
00:35:30,240 --> 00:35:31,200
um

799
00:35:31,200 --> 00:35:34,740
so the I did I created the burden

800
00:35:34,740 --> 00:35:36,480
challenges the challenge response once

801
00:35:36,480 --> 00:35:39,000
earlier so that was already uh I had a

802
00:35:39,000 --> 00:35:40,740
prototype and actually it was kind of

803
00:35:40,740 --> 00:35:42,420
the final version straight away so that

804
00:35:42,420 --> 00:35:44,160
went in

805
00:35:44,160 --> 00:35:45,180
um

806
00:35:45,180 --> 00:35:47,700
but now for an adventure like we have

807
00:35:47,700 --> 00:35:49,680
been brainstorming we have been we set

808
00:35:49,680 --> 00:35:51,119
up a document with all kinds of details

809
00:35:51,119 --> 00:35:52,680
of what we want to incorporate and then

810
00:35:52,680 --> 00:35:54,660
how do you make a storyline that's

811
00:35:54,660 --> 00:35:57,900
consistent that's yeah so that's really

812
00:35:57,900 --> 00:36:01,800
what took time to work on and um

813
00:36:01,800 --> 00:36:03,980
and since we had some elements that were

814
00:36:03,980 --> 00:36:07,560
real life elements I I thought okay

815
00:36:07,560 --> 00:36:09,240
let's just focus on everything that's on

816
00:36:09,240 --> 00:36:10,800
the batch and see where it comes from

817
00:36:10,800 --> 00:36:12,560
like where does lapis lazuli come from

818
00:36:12,560 --> 00:36:16,020
what was John D actually in his life how

819
00:36:16,020 --> 00:36:18,000
can we incorporated in the story

820
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:20,220
and in the end that's where the where

821
00:36:20,220 --> 00:36:22,079
the whole essentially can come from

822
00:36:22,079 --> 00:36:25,880
so it's mixed mixed uh reality events

823
00:36:25,880 --> 00:36:28,800
with a bit of fantasy because time

824
00:36:28,800 --> 00:36:30,420
travel is still not possible as these

825
00:36:30,420 --> 00:36:31,980
days I know but that's in the back

826
00:36:31,980 --> 00:36:33,540
somehow

827
00:36:33,540 --> 00:36:34,619
um

828
00:36:34,619 --> 00:36:36,920
so that's basically uh how I ended up

829
00:36:36,920 --> 00:36:39,599
filling again a Json file because the

830
00:36:39,599 --> 00:36:41,940
whole game is a Json file being compiled

831
00:36:41,940 --> 00:36:44,820
into something that can be used

832
00:36:44,820 --> 00:36:45,780
um

833
00:36:45,780 --> 00:36:47,820
a little bit about the Json because how

834
00:36:47,820 --> 00:36:49,500
can you make something work like this in

835
00:36:49,500 --> 00:36:51,900
a Json file uh we have a lot of status

836
00:36:51,900 --> 00:36:54,660
bits in the eprom that that tell you if

837
00:36:54,660 --> 00:36:57,240
you picked up an object if it's uh if

838
00:36:57,240 --> 00:37:00,240
you use an object if you when what kind

839
00:37:00,240 --> 00:37:01,440
of object can you use and what other

840
00:37:01,440 --> 00:37:03,480
kinds of objects all been defined in

841
00:37:03,480 --> 00:37:04,680
these um

842
00:37:04,680 --> 00:37:07,140
in these settings and if you look at the

843
00:37:07,140 --> 00:37:09,480
facial ACL it's an access control list

844
00:37:09,480 --> 00:37:12,020
if an object is visible

845
00:37:12,020 --> 00:37:15,180
we have 128 status Bits And if you

846
00:37:15,180 --> 00:37:18,300
enable the high-end bits it's not shown

847
00:37:18,300 --> 00:37:21,359
so you can remove things from the GUI or

848
00:37:21,359 --> 00:37:23,880
from the from the text Center and any

849
00:37:23,880 --> 00:37:26,579
status says below 128 is you need to

850
00:37:26,579 --> 00:37:28,859
have a certain bit set before the object

851
00:37:28,859 --> 00:37:30,300
is really there

852
00:37:30,300 --> 00:37:32,339
sometimes I have an object with the same

853
00:37:32,339 --> 00:37:34,619
name with the two status codes so it

854
00:37:34,619 --> 00:37:36,540
changes when you do something the object

855
00:37:36,540 --> 00:37:38,460
changes and

856
00:37:38,460 --> 00:37:41,880
yeah with these elements and with an ACL

857
00:37:41,880 --> 00:37:43,200
what you can do with an object if you

858
00:37:43,200 --> 00:37:45,060
can read it if you can look at it if you

859
00:37:45,060 --> 00:37:47,820
can use it you can build a game just by

860
00:37:47,820 --> 00:37:49,920
using a Json file

861
00:37:49,920 --> 00:37:52,079
it's already been open sourced in in

862
00:37:52,079 --> 00:37:54,119
three years ago we'll publish our code

863
00:37:54,119 --> 00:37:56,280
that you'll talk about that later so

864
00:37:56,280 --> 00:37:58,020
that's basically what uh what I did and

865
00:37:58,020 --> 00:37:59,400
then those finished

866
00:37:59,400 --> 00:38:01,740
quite

867
00:38:01,740 --> 00:38:04,740
just in the yes

868
00:38:04,740 --> 00:38:07,339
take it away

869
00:38:08,339 --> 00:38:09,599
so

870
00:38:09,599 --> 00:38:10,740
um

871
00:38:10,740 --> 00:38:14,040
we were done two hours before I drove

872
00:38:14,040 --> 00:38:18,420
off to Amazon for this red shop

873
00:38:18,420 --> 00:38:20,880
like we were still making changes and

874
00:38:20,880 --> 00:38:24,420
compiling and stuff and testing

875
00:38:24,420 --> 00:38:26,180
um

876
00:38:26,180 --> 00:38:29,940
so I had my mind still on firmware and

877
00:38:29,940 --> 00:38:33,000
not on packaging things

878
00:38:33,000 --> 00:38:36,480
um but all the stuff was there so with

879
00:38:36,480 --> 00:38:38,700
the people that were present uh over

880
00:38:38,700 --> 00:38:39,960
there

881
00:38:39,960 --> 00:38:40,740
um

882
00:38:40,740 --> 00:38:44,280
we managed to set up a nice assembly

883
00:38:44,280 --> 00:38:47,099
line and had everything packaged in

884
00:38:47,099 --> 00:38:51,060
about two two and a half hours like Demi

885
00:38:51,060 --> 00:38:54,380
said in his opening talk he was

886
00:38:54,380 --> 00:38:58,440
surprised how well that went

887
00:38:58,440 --> 00:38:58,980
um

888
00:38:58,980 --> 00:39:01,740
of course what he didn't tell was okay

889
00:39:01,740 --> 00:39:05,400
the lanyards were like a day late they

890
00:39:05,400 --> 00:39:09,060
arrived on Monday instead of Friday

891
00:39:09,060 --> 00:39:10,020
um

892
00:39:10,020 --> 00:39:12,660
so we had to do a second stretch up in

893
00:39:12,660 --> 00:39:14,280
the bar here

894
00:39:14,280 --> 00:39:18,359
that took another two hours so in total

895
00:39:18,359 --> 00:39:21,720
we were busy like four hours filling up

896
00:39:21,720 --> 00:39:24,540
the bags and uh

897
00:39:24,540 --> 00:39:27,119
shooting everything

898
00:39:27,119 --> 00:39:27,780
um

899
00:39:27,780 --> 00:39:29,700
I would like to thank everybody that

900
00:39:29,700 --> 00:39:32,760
helped and she Nora and Richard over

901
00:39:32,760 --> 00:39:33,960
there

902
00:39:33,960 --> 00:39:34,980
um

903
00:39:34,980 --> 00:39:38,839
done Chantal whoop

904
00:39:38,839 --> 00:39:42,839
I'm forgetting a lot of people I'm sorry

905
00:39:42,839 --> 00:39:46,340
um but your help was greatly appreciated

906
00:39:46,340 --> 00:39:55,550
[Applause]

907
00:39:56,220 --> 00:39:58,140
and then we're done

908
00:39:58,140 --> 00:40:00,480
there were no major issues at least we

909
00:40:00,480 --> 00:40:02,880
didn't break rule number zero we didn't

910
00:40:02,880 --> 00:40:05,579
set anybody on fire

911
00:40:05,579 --> 00:40:07,579
um

912
00:40:09,119 --> 00:40:13,200
we only have about four hours I guess

913
00:40:13,200 --> 00:40:15,799
we'll be fine

914
00:40:16,020 --> 00:40:19,020
anything

915
00:40:23,760 --> 00:40:26,180
a bit like a mini

916
00:40:26,180 --> 00:40:29,779
we'll get to that

917
00:40:31,980 --> 00:40:36,000
we did need a firmware upgrades

918
00:40:36,000 --> 00:40:37,320
um so

919
00:40:37,320 --> 00:40:39,480
um sack I forgot some things I guess

920
00:40:39,480 --> 00:40:41,940
yeah yeah because there were some

921
00:40:41,940 --> 00:40:43,560
interaction things that interacted of

922
00:40:43,560 --> 00:40:45,599
course with the objects I forgot to put

923
00:40:45,599 --> 00:40:48,079
an ACL

924
00:40:48,200 --> 00:40:50,640
what you can do with an object so the

925
00:40:50,640 --> 00:40:52,440
hints that were appearing because of the

926
00:40:52,440 --> 00:40:54,180
best to best communication you couldn't

927
00:40:54,180 --> 00:40:55,500
read them you could see them but you

928
00:40:55,500 --> 00:40:56,520
couldn't read them and if you couldn't

929
00:40:56,520 --> 00:40:58,859
read them you can solve the challenge so

930
00:40:58,859 --> 00:41:00,900
we did have to like first we had some

931
00:41:00,900 --> 00:41:02,640
optimizations for the batch in the

932
00:41:02,640 --> 00:41:04,680
firmware so it was nice to have to have

933
00:41:04,680 --> 00:41:06,900
another firmware but now it was needed

934
00:41:06,900 --> 00:41:09,599
and we discovered that on Friday a 30

935
00:41:09,599 --> 00:41:11,880
Evening actually I think so we had a

936
00:41:11,880 --> 00:41:15,300
little uh yeah coding exercise on Friday

937
00:41:15,300 --> 00:41:19,920
and create a new forever and we also

938
00:41:19,920 --> 00:41:22,800
discovered another thing that if Rita

939
00:41:22,800 --> 00:41:25,020
tried to give you one of the hints the

940
00:41:25,020 --> 00:41:27,720
utf-8 wasn't displayed correctly the web

941
00:41:27,720 --> 00:41:31,020
USB yeah so we also had to fix that at

942
00:41:31,020 --> 00:41:32,940
the last minute

943
00:41:32,940 --> 00:41:39,300
um and a bit of a hardware work was that

944
00:41:39,300 --> 00:41:41,400
um some people

945
00:41:41,400 --> 00:41:42,320
um

946
00:41:42,320 --> 00:41:46,200
didn't put in the battery correctly it

947
00:41:46,200 --> 00:41:47,940
had a bit of a trick where you had to

948
00:41:47,940 --> 00:41:49,680
push the battery in the bottom and then

949
00:41:49,680 --> 00:41:52,200
click it into place and if you just

950
00:41:52,200 --> 00:41:55,560
pushed it in you bent those pins

951
00:41:55,560 --> 00:41:58,380
um all of these things ended up on the

952
00:41:58,380 --> 00:42:00,599
website that was displayed on the memo

953
00:42:00,599 --> 00:42:03,599
and ishidora.nl

954
00:42:03,599 --> 00:42:04,920
um

955
00:42:04,920 --> 00:42:09,599
there were two Puffs to solve this batch

956
00:42:09,599 --> 00:42:12,180
there was the official path where you

957
00:42:12,180 --> 00:42:16,160
figured out all the hints and

958
00:42:16,160 --> 00:42:19,440
go through it that way there was also

959
00:42:19,440 --> 00:42:21,960
another way

960
00:42:21,960 --> 00:42:24,240
um just pulling apart the firmware and

961
00:42:24,240 --> 00:42:26,880
trying to figure it out of course I have

962
00:42:26,880 --> 00:42:28,090
to mention renze again

963
00:42:28,090 --> 00:42:31,940
[Laughter]

964
00:42:31,940 --> 00:42:36,740
because I think they took that part

965
00:42:38,640 --> 00:42:40,980
well actually we decided because we knew

966
00:42:40,980 --> 00:42:42,660
already that some things wouldn't be

967
00:42:42,660 --> 00:42:45,300
very closed off so we decided it's like

968
00:42:45,300 --> 00:42:47,640
a hotel let people play the game if they

969
00:42:47,640 --> 00:42:49,560
want to hack the game let's have some

970
00:42:49,560 --> 00:42:51,900
entry points that people can do that as

971
00:42:51,900 --> 00:42:55,140
well so that's yeah I think that's fun

972
00:42:55,140 --> 00:42:58,020
yeah you can play the game as you want

973
00:42:58,020 --> 00:43:00,720
it's a hacker event so we kind of expect

974
00:43:00,720 --> 00:43:03,060
that people were doing those kinds of

975
00:43:03,060 --> 00:43:05,099
things

976
00:43:05,099 --> 00:43:07,560
so the theme

977
00:43:07,560 --> 00:43:08,520
um

978
00:43:08,520 --> 00:43:13,500
I would like to thank Nicolette and

979
00:43:14,400 --> 00:43:17,720
and second

980
00:43:18,480 --> 00:43:21,540
um a great help was Tom

981
00:43:21,540 --> 00:43:23,940
that help with production

982
00:43:23,940 --> 00:43:27,240
and people that are certainly not here

983
00:43:27,240 --> 00:43:31,380
but did some components of it were yours

984
00:43:31,380 --> 00:43:35,720
that helped us with the web USB

985
00:43:36,839 --> 00:43:40,760
and high allows that did the design

986
00:43:40,760 --> 00:43:44,900
with at the bottom size

987
00:43:46,630 --> 00:43:52,980
[Applause]

988
00:43:52,980 --> 00:43:55,020
this patch wouldn't have been possible

989
00:43:55,020 --> 00:43:55,880
without

990
00:43:55,880 --> 00:43:59,640
sponsors and we would really like to

991
00:43:59,640 --> 00:44:04,140
thank axis 42 for sponsoring the badge

992
00:44:04,140 --> 00:44:07,760
looks also sponsoring the lanyards yay

993
00:44:07,760 --> 00:44:11,460
that was a quite big boom item so I was

994
00:44:11,460 --> 00:44:14,640
very happy they would they sponsored us

995
00:44:14,640 --> 00:44:18,920
um station Electronics also sponsored as

996
00:44:18,960 --> 00:44:21,720
and again Raspberry Pi gave us the

997
00:44:21,720 --> 00:44:24,720
rp2040s

998
00:44:26,880 --> 00:44:31,260
we would also like to thank Norbert

999
00:44:31,260 --> 00:44:33,119
um at onet China

1000
00:44:33,119 --> 00:44:35,339
because

1001
00:44:35,339 --> 00:44:38,940
without his help and making sure that

1002
00:44:38,940 --> 00:44:41,819
everything got reworked we wouldn't have

1003
00:44:41,819 --> 00:44:45,200
a badge here on time yeah

1004
00:44:45,599 --> 00:44:47,040
now

1005
00:44:47,040 --> 00:44:49,140
we have a vacancy

1006
00:44:49,140 --> 00:44:52,980
after three years of working on a badge

1007
00:44:52,980 --> 00:44:54,599
um I would like to do some other

1008
00:44:54,599 --> 00:44:57,200
projects

1009
00:44:57,480 --> 00:45:00,960
um so it's time for another team

1010
00:45:00,960 --> 00:45:03,180
um if you would like to do the next

1011
00:45:03,180 --> 00:45:05,579
haircut oh

1012
00:45:05,579 --> 00:45:08,420
um you can talk to Dimitri

1013
00:45:08,420 --> 00:45:10,819
at breakfast tomorrow

1014
00:45:10,819 --> 00:45:13,560
you don't really have to do it at

1015
00:45:13,560 --> 00:45:16,500
breakfast tomorrow but we could give you

1016
00:45:16,500 --> 00:45:18,480
some hints and tell you more about

1017
00:45:18,480 --> 00:45:20,819
project management and the that sort of

1018
00:45:20,819 --> 00:45:24,020
stuff if you're interested

1019
00:45:24,060 --> 00:45:26,819
um why would you want to build a badge

1020
00:45:26,819 --> 00:45:29,280
well you have a great idea and want to

1021
00:45:29,280 --> 00:45:30,440
give it to

1022
00:45:30,440 --> 00:45:33,900
400 other people

1023
00:45:33,900 --> 00:45:36,119
um or you are great at project

1024
00:45:36,119 --> 00:45:39,060
management or want to learn how to be

1025
00:45:39,060 --> 00:45:41,700
good at project management

1026
00:45:41,700 --> 00:45:43,800
um and you want to collaborate with

1027
00:45:43,800 --> 00:45:47,420
amazing people on something

1028
00:45:50,220 --> 00:45:54,000
now the event is done now what I

1029
00:45:54,000 --> 00:45:57,240
expected some people haven't unpacked

1030
00:45:57,240 --> 00:46:01,020
their bag with the badge or just didn't

1031
00:46:01,020 --> 00:46:04,500
get to all the hints and stuff

1032
00:46:04,500 --> 00:46:07,680
um we will publish them on our website

1033
00:46:07,680 --> 00:46:11,819
so you can also play the game at home

1034
00:46:11,819 --> 00:46:14,520
um we will release the source code and

1035
00:46:14,520 --> 00:46:17,280
the hardware

1036
00:46:17,280 --> 00:46:22,079
um also on that website after the event

1037
00:46:22,079 --> 00:46:23,099
um

1038
00:46:23,099 --> 00:46:25,260
and we will also put on some

1039
00:46:25,260 --> 00:46:29,160
instructions for how to reuse your batch

1040
00:46:29,160 --> 00:46:32,099
um a hint it's basically a Raspberry Pi

1041
00:46:32,099 --> 00:46:34,500
Pico with some LEDs and buttons on there

1042
00:46:34,500 --> 00:46:36,420
and the keyboard connected to interface

1043
00:46:36,420 --> 00:46:39,619
with the rest yes

1044
00:46:39,750 --> 00:46:40,200
[Music]

1045
00:46:40,200 --> 00:46:41,400
um

1046
00:46:41,400 --> 00:46:44,520
for now if you want to contact us please

1047
00:46:44,520 --> 00:46:47,700
file a issue on the GitHub repository

1048
00:46:47,700 --> 00:46:51,180
that's linked um we will also put on

1049
00:46:51,180 --> 00:46:55,500
there a way to contact us later for

1050
00:46:55,500 --> 00:46:59,400
and we're also still here today so if

1051
00:46:59,400 --> 00:47:02,160
you find out that your badge has an

1052
00:47:02,160 --> 00:47:04,260
issue or something or still want to ask

1053
00:47:04,260 --> 00:47:07,079
us questions and you can still that do

1054
00:47:07,079 --> 00:47:09,000
that today

1055
00:47:09,000 --> 00:47:12,480
and talking about questions

1056
00:47:12,480 --> 00:47:15,800
does anybody have questions

1057
00:47:16,800 --> 00:47:20,780
do you have a throw mic or anything

1058
00:47:29,780 --> 00:47:33,300
can you give it a little bit of a bigger

1059
00:47:33,300 --> 00:47:35,940
hint where we find the missing part

1060
00:47:35,940 --> 00:47:39,200
the missing part of the of the badge yes

1061
00:47:39,200 --> 00:47:43,079
next to the reception okay

1062
00:47:43,079 --> 00:47:45,450
thanks and and also in the slides

1063
00:47:45,450 --> 00:47:49,079
[Laughter]

1064
00:47:49,079 --> 00:47:52,400
hello hello hello hello

1065
00:47:58,319 --> 00:48:01,160
any other questions

1066
00:48:03,240 --> 00:48:06,180
what was the barrier to the the

1067
00:48:06,180 --> 00:48:10,319
the level of the contestants you looked

1068
00:48:10,319 --> 00:48:12,960
for because I find very the first

1069
00:48:12,960 --> 00:48:15,180
challenge is quite hard actually to to

1070
00:48:15,180 --> 00:48:17,819
continue are you talking about the

1071
00:48:17,819 --> 00:48:20,400
challenge response yeah

1072
00:48:20,400 --> 00:48:23,339
yeah it's really hard to make uh 15

1073
00:48:23,339 --> 00:48:25,560
because we had like four data bits so

1074
00:48:25,560 --> 00:48:27,599
that's 16 challenges and as we start

1075
00:48:27,599 --> 00:48:29,579
with one and then it's 15 and to create

1076
00:48:29,579 --> 00:48:32,579
15 unique challenges on a challenge

1077
00:48:32,579 --> 00:48:34,619
response game that's really hard

1078
00:48:34,619 --> 00:48:40,560
so am I my brain is kind of evil so yeah

1079
00:48:40,560 --> 00:48:42,859
so I started with of course like uh

1080
00:48:42,859 --> 00:48:45,839
repeats in first then I won't go don't

1081
00:48:45,839 --> 00:48:48,060
know this but yeah so the easy ones that

1082
00:48:48,060 --> 00:48:49,740
you can do visually and then I thought

1083
00:48:49,740 --> 00:48:51,420
okay let's do something where you need

1084
00:48:51,420 --> 00:48:52,980
to calculate things

1085
00:48:52,980 --> 00:48:54,800
because then you need to

1086
00:48:54,800 --> 00:48:57,660
interpret the the binary code as a

1087
00:48:57,660 --> 00:48:59,760
number and then if you have two or three

1088
00:48:59,760 --> 00:49:01,560
examples you would probably see the

1089
00:49:01,560 --> 00:49:03,240
pattern and you can do it

1090
00:49:03,240 --> 00:49:06,000
and then I did okay let's do something

1091
00:49:06,000 --> 00:49:08,400
with some sets of information so you

1092
00:49:08,400 --> 00:49:09,720
need to interpret the data in another

1093
00:49:09,720 --> 00:49:12,900
way and probably yeah people that do a

1094
00:49:12,900 --> 00:49:14,099
little bit of hacking and stuff they

1095
00:49:14,099 --> 00:49:16,800
recognize characters probably so I try

1096
00:49:16,800 --> 00:49:19,140
to build up on that and in the end for

1097
00:49:19,140 --> 00:49:21,140
the really

1098
00:49:21,140 --> 00:49:23,520
hard-coded nerds let's put in some

1099
00:49:23,520 --> 00:49:25,319
really challenging challenges at the end

1100
00:49:25,319 --> 00:49:27,599
and yeah so

1101
00:49:27,599 --> 00:49:29,520
I got a complaint from him like this is

1102
00:49:29,520 --> 00:49:31,980
hard to complicated so I shift him a

1103
00:49:31,980 --> 00:49:33,599
little bit so that they were in a more

1104
00:49:33,599 --> 00:49:36,660
logical order I removed one that was but

1105
00:49:36,660 --> 00:49:39,060
I agreed it was too difficult and uh

1106
00:49:39,060 --> 00:49:40,920
added another one I think that was a

1107
00:49:40,920 --> 00:49:42,480
little more in the middle

1108
00:49:42,480 --> 00:49:45,060
and then yeah let's go with this and as

1109
00:49:45,060 --> 00:49:47,040
there are two paths basically the

1110
00:49:47,040 --> 00:49:50,040
batches two uh two challenges on the

1111
00:49:50,040 --> 00:49:52,020
best like the the location codes and the

1112
00:49:52,020 --> 00:49:53,339
the challenge response if you finish

1113
00:49:53,339 --> 00:49:55,020
either one of those

1114
00:49:55,020 --> 00:49:56,760
and one of those is really easy just

1115
00:49:56,760 --> 00:49:59,099
copy the numbers from the from the the

1116
00:49:59,099 --> 00:50:01,200
signs that would get you into the

1117
00:50:01,200 --> 00:50:03,119
bootloader mode from the online yard and

1118
00:50:03,119 --> 00:50:04,619
then after that you could start the

1119
00:50:04,619 --> 00:50:06,359
adventure so you didn't need to finish

1120
00:50:06,359 --> 00:50:07,980
the Tiana's responses that those were

1121
00:50:07,980 --> 00:50:11,460
there as a Pastime thingy to do

1122
00:50:11,460 --> 00:50:14,819
parallel to the adventure game

1123
00:50:14,819 --> 00:50:17,819
and yeah that's we we could have put a

1124
00:50:17,819 --> 00:50:20,160
little bit more documentation on but I

1125
00:50:20,160 --> 00:50:21,359
answered quite a few questions from

1126
00:50:21,359 --> 00:50:23,339
people and we were I think quite

1127
00:50:23,339 --> 00:50:25,680
reachable but so yeah

1128
00:50:25,680 --> 00:50:28,079
but yeah it's always documentation is

1129
00:50:28,079 --> 00:50:31,680
always like thingy

1130
00:50:31,680 --> 00:50:34,079
question but good point

1131
00:50:34,079 --> 00:50:38,000
yeah here's a question over here

1132
00:50:38,520 --> 00:50:42,119
the back side of the tablets it's really

1133
00:50:42,119 --> 00:50:43,920
cool design so it will go on my wall

1134
00:50:43,920 --> 00:50:46,260
because my whole house is blue and gold

1135
00:50:46,260 --> 00:50:50,460
it's perfect but the characters on it uh

1136
00:50:50,460 --> 00:50:53,099
what is it aspired of exactly is it

1137
00:50:53,099 --> 00:50:57,059
aesthetic of a Aztec or

1138
00:50:57,059 --> 00:50:59,880
well we were we were discussing IDs and

1139
00:50:59,880 --> 00:51:02,640
and we came up with uh is this a spoiler

1140
00:51:02,640 --> 00:51:04,339
or not

1141
00:51:04,339 --> 00:51:06,500
yeah maybe

1142
00:51:06,500 --> 00:51:09,839
a good point I could tell you all about

1143
00:51:09,839 --> 00:51:12,780
it once you solved it or you could come

1144
00:51:12,780 --> 00:51:15,240
to me and I can tell you in person but

1145
00:51:15,240 --> 00:51:17,880
if I tell you even just two keywords of

1146
00:51:17,880 --> 00:51:22,020
it it you can so easily Google it or go

1147
00:51:22,020 --> 00:51:24,059
it or browse for it that it will just be

1148
00:51:24,059 --> 00:51:26,040
a spoiler so easily

1149
00:51:26,040 --> 00:51:29,760
so come finally and I'll tell you

1150
00:51:29,760 --> 00:51:32,040
okay

1151
00:51:32,040 --> 00:51:34,380
there is that too but I didn't specify

1152
00:51:34,380 --> 00:51:37,520
what was it yeah

1153
00:51:37,619 --> 00:51:39,599
if even if it was let's pretend it was

1154
00:51:39,599 --> 00:51:41,839
not

1155
00:51:42,180 --> 00:51:44,339
no I specifically look for

1156
00:51:44,339 --> 00:51:47,940
like a scan of handwritten text with no

1157
00:51:47,940 --> 00:51:50,160
translation to it did I write anywhere

1158
00:51:50,160 --> 00:51:51,780
where it was we can look but let's

1159
00:51:51,780 --> 00:51:54,500
pretend it's not there

1160
00:51:56,280 --> 00:52:01,260
it's not there no it's not there

1161
00:52:01,260 --> 00:52:03,900
listen

1162
00:52:03,900 --> 00:52:05,460
it's destroying in our remark it's

1163
00:52:05,460 --> 00:52:06,900
either there or not there and we don't

1164
00:52:06,900 --> 00:52:10,140
know if it's difficult it may or may not

1165
00:52:10,140 --> 00:52:12,480
be on the picture frame which you have

1166
00:52:12,480 --> 00:52:14,280
to find first which was already said

1167
00:52:14,280 --> 00:52:15,660
where it is so if you remember your

1168
00:52:15,660 --> 00:52:18,240
golden if not good luck finding it

1169
00:52:18,240 --> 00:52:19,140
yeah

1170
00:52:19,140 --> 00:52:22,400
okay there's another question over here

1171
00:52:22,800 --> 00:52:24,420
so it yeah it's been really fun to play

1172
00:52:24,420 --> 00:52:26,160
with so far so thank you

1173
00:52:26,160 --> 00:52:29,099
um we are kind of stuck with like we

1174
00:52:29,099 --> 00:52:30,839
have to find others but we don't know

1175
00:52:30,839 --> 00:52:33,000
how to identify like badges that are

1176
00:52:33,000 --> 00:52:34,380
different than ours or how to interact

1177
00:52:34,380 --> 00:52:35,940
in any way do you have any good hint

1178
00:52:35,940 --> 00:52:38,760
there uh come see us Yeah okay or if

1179
00:52:38,760 --> 00:52:40,800
everybody else wants to know let's come

1180
00:52:40,800 --> 00:52:44,059
see us I think basically

1181
00:52:45,000 --> 00:52:46,980
put something online yeah of course

1182
00:52:46,980 --> 00:52:48,960
because the best communication can only

1183
00:52:48,960 --> 00:52:51,540
happen here of course more or less so we

1184
00:52:51,540 --> 00:52:53,579
need to put something online for doing

1185
00:52:53,579 --> 00:52:57,780
that after the event so we will so yeah

1186
00:52:57,780 --> 00:52:59,900
okay we have time for one more question

1187
00:52:59,900 --> 00:53:03,059
one final question

1188
00:53:03,059 --> 00:53:05,599
yes

1189
00:53:05,640 --> 00:53:07,319
actually this might be a stupid question

1190
00:53:07,319 --> 00:53:08,880
because I didn't really get that far

1191
00:53:08,880 --> 00:53:10,800
with the challenge yet but on the back

1192
00:53:10,800 --> 00:53:13,260
there's a row of solar pads is that just

1193
00:53:13,260 --> 00:53:16,980
for accessing the the and use data pins

1194
00:53:16,980 --> 00:53:17,700
yeah

1195
00:53:17,700 --> 00:53:19,980
yeah just for accessing the data pins

1196
00:53:19,980 --> 00:53:21,079
and

1197
00:53:21,079 --> 00:53:23,460
possibly reusing the batch all right

1198
00:53:23,460 --> 00:53:25,559
yeah because I saw a square away so I

1199
00:53:25,559 --> 00:53:29,099
got excited but it is indeed a hint of

1200
00:53:29,099 --> 00:53:31,140
what is on the pins yeah okay I got it

1201
00:53:31,140 --> 00:53:33,558
then yeah

1202
00:53:36,540 --> 00:53:37,920
it's recognized on

1203
00:53:37,920 --> 00:53:40,859
on size yeah for aesthetic artistic

1204
00:53:40,859 --> 00:53:43,339
reasons

1205
00:53:43,680 --> 00:53:45,119
okay

1206
00:53:45,119 --> 00:53:47,220
um as Pim said we're looking for a new

1207
00:53:47,220 --> 00:53:49,380
batch team so you can come talk to me

1208
00:53:49,380 --> 00:53:51,359

1209
00:53:51,359 --> 00:53:53,400
hopefully Now understand after seeing

1210

oh yeah I'm gonna do it

1213
00:54:00,000 --> 00:54:01,920
