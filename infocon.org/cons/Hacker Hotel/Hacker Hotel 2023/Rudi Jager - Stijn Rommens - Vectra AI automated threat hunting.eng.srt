1
00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:04,680
so good afternoon uh 10 to 3 but we're

2
00:00:04,680 --> 00:00:06,600
going to speed up I promise you that we

3
00:00:06,600 --> 00:00:09,059
will still be able to cover everything

4
00:00:09,059 --> 00:00:11,280
we'd like to cover today especially a

5
00:00:11,280 --> 00:00:14,759
topic on Automation and AI driven

6
00:00:14,759 --> 00:00:17,580
capabilities to help you or your

7
00:00:17,580 --> 00:00:19,199
colleagues that are on the blue team

8
00:00:19,199 --> 00:00:21,480
side of the world in detecting cyber

9
00:00:21,480 --> 00:00:23,460
attacks in a network and it's a hybrid

10
00:00:23,460 --> 00:00:24,720
Network that means it's a physical

11
00:00:24,720 --> 00:00:27,180
Network as well as the cloud components

12
00:00:27,180 --> 00:00:30,300
so what I'd like to do is to give you

13
00:00:30,300 --> 00:00:32,098
quickly an idea about what Vectra is

14
00:00:32,098 --> 00:00:34,079
because probably you have never heard

15
00:00:34,079 --> 00:00:37,860
about us it's not a model of Opel it's

16
00:00:37,860 --> 00:00:38,840
really

17
00:00:38,840 --> 00:00:42,059
definitely a cyber security tool it's an

18
00:00:42,059 --> 00:00:44,460
AI driven tool but it's data science I

19
00:00:44,460 --> 00:00:46,200
will really focus on the data science

20
00:00:46,200 --> 00:00:49,140
component in a minute but if all okay

21
00:00:49,140 --> 00:00:51,420
for you let's have a quick intro we're

22
00:00:51,420 --> 00:00:53,280
here also together with access 42 and

23
00:00:53,280 --> 00:00:55,440
they're using our technology really and

24
00:00:55,440 --> 00:00:57,360
their setup as well to protect and

25
00:00:57,360 --> 00:01:01,160
secure their customers environment

26
00:01:01,160 --> 00:01:03,960
I'm responsible at Vectra for the system

27
00:01:03,960 --> 00:01:06,360
engineering team in north tmea and I've

28
00:01:06,360 --> 00:01:08,220
been working in network security for

29
00:01:08,220 --> 00:01:10,799
over 20 years now I've spent time at

30
00:01:10,799 --> 00:01:12,720
Juniper Networks at Palo Alto networks

31
00:01:12,720 --> 00:01:14,580
at semantic and now I'm already three

32
00:01:14,580 --> 00:01:16,680
years also at Vectra and what we have

33
00:01:16,680 --> 00:01:19,020
seen actually over all of those years is

34
00:01:19,020 --> 00:01:21,600
a lot of change but at the same time

35
00:01:21,600 --> 00:01:23,520
there was always one theme and that

36
00:01:23,520 --> 00:01:25,320
theme is that when you look at cyber

37
00:01:25,320 --> 00:01:27,360
security and you translate that in a

38
00:01:27,360 --> 00:01:30,600
word there's one word it's more more of

39
00:01:30,600 --> 00:01:32,640
everything right and that more of

40
00:01:32,640 --> 00:01:34,920
everything really goes on a lot of

41
00:01:34,920 --> 00:01:38,100
individual items but it goes really on

42
00:01:38,100 --> 00:01:40,200
everything we take we take care of every

43
00:01:40,200 --> 00:01:42,840
day so more attacks more vectors more

44
00:01:42,840 --> 00:01:44,640
vulnerabilities more tools more data

45
00:01:44,640 --> 00:01:48,479
more alerts more rules but also a lot of

46
00:01:48,479 --> 00:01:51,240
more work because the persistency the

47
00:01:51,240 --> 00:01:53,100
complexity of the attacks is not

48
00:01:53,100 --> 00:01:55,560
decreasing so there's a lot of that that

49
00:01:55,560 --> 00:01:58,560
is continuously on the move as well and

50
00:01:58,560 --> 00:02:00,180
there's one little thing that I also

51
00:02:00,180 --> 00:02:02,520
would like to add here and that is that

52
00:02:02,520 --> 00:02:05,399
with all of that search with all that

53
00:02:05,399 --> 00:02:07,860
hunting with all that work there's also

54
00:02:07,860 --> 00:02:09,780
a huge problem and I'm not sure if you

55
00:02:09,780 --> 00:02:12,239
see that as well and the reason I want

56
00:02:12,239 --> 00:02:13,739
to quickly add that is we had another

57
00:02:13,739 --> 00:02:16,200
session earlier this week where we had a

58
00:02:16,200 --> 00:02:17,700
questionnaire I'm going to show you that

59
00:02:17,700 --> 00:02:20,099
questionnaire in a second but we noticed

60
00:02:20,099 --> 00:02:22,860
that with all of that work and the

61
00:02:22,860 --> 00:02:25,319
pressure it brings to us to individual

62
00:02:25,319 --> 00:02:27,900
individually hunt to look for tools that

63
00:02:27,900 --> 00:02:29,459
maybe you you've been building yourself

64
00:02:29,459 --> 00:02:32,220
or or that you've been colliding from

65
00:02:32,220 --> 00:02:35,099
different sets into one it is sometimes

66
00:02:35,099 --> 00:02:36,959
very very difficult to find the real

67
00:02:36,959 --> 00:02:39,060
problem right because all of those

68
00:02:39,060 --> 00:02:41,700
persistencies in in the network by the

69
00:02:41,700 --> 00:02:44,879
attackers they're using of the land so

70
00:02:44,879 --> 00:02:47,220
living of the land tools they're hiding

71
00:02:47,220 --> 00:02:49,260
in plain sight and that is making it so

72
00:02:49,260 --> 00:02:51,660
difficult and we really really see that

73
00:02:51,660 --> 00:02:53,879
our people but also our customers people

74
00:02:53,879 --> 00:02:56,519
are really into that burnout and we had

75
00:02:56,519 --> 00:02:58,319
this question really earlier this week

76
00:02:58,319 --> 00:03:00,599
on Thursday in a webinar and everyone

77
00:03:00,599 --> 00:03:02,940
could vote and the result of that vote

78
00:03:02,940 --> 00:03:05,760
was when I asked a company

79
00:03:05,760 --> 00:03:08,580
is your company taking care of mental

80
00:03:08,580 --> 00:03:10,860
well-being of your employees on both

81
00:03:10,860 --> 00:03:14,040
sides employees that potentially clicked

82
00:03:14,040 --> 00:03:16,019
for instance a phishing link or phishing

83
00:03:16,019 --> 00:03:17,760
email and as such kind of were the

84
00:03:17,760 --> 00:03:20,099
trigger to the start of it of a campaign

85
00:03:20,099 --> 00:03:22,860
or an attack but also do we take care of

86
00:03:22,860 --> 00:03:26,040
those that are helping out when there is

87
00:03:26,040 --> 00:03:28,260
an attack right that are doing those 24

88
00:03:28,260 --> 00:03:31,140
48 72 hours in the beginning to try and

89
00:03:31,140 --> 00:03:34,620
find it and what we found out is that

90
00:03:34,620 --> 00:03:37,500
actually a lot of companies are not

91
00:03:37,500 --> 00:03:39,540
taking that into account and I think

92
00:03:39,540 --> 00:03:41,400
that was for me a wake-up call because

93
00:03:41,400 --> 00:03:43,019
that is all related to all the

94
00:03:43,019 --> 00:03:44,819
individual work that we do where we're

95
00:03:44,819 --> 00:03:47,519
not automating as good as we can and

96
00:03:47,519 --> 00:03:49,620
that is definitely one of the drivers of

97
00:03:49,620 --> 00:03:51,840
what vectorize because the Cornerstone

98
00:03:51,840 --> 00:03:53,940
of what we tried to do is to look for

99
00:03:53,940 --> 00:03:55,019
the unknown

100
00:03:55,019 --> 00:03:58,739
the known is quite well covered today

101
00:03:58,739 --> 00:04:00,840
you have signature driven to Solutions

102
00:04:00,840 --> 00:04:03,000
you have your vulnerability assessments

103
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:05,760
you have your cve repositories you have

104
00:04:05,760 --> 00:04:07,319
your threat indicators you have your

105
00:04:07,319 --> 00:04:09,900
threat feeds all of that is very well

106
00:04:09,900 --> 00:04:11,879
maintained and is available freely and

107
00:04:11,879 --> 00:04:13,799
widely often and it's been shared

108
00:04:13,799 --> 00:04:15,480
between a lot of companies

109
00:04:15,480 --> 00:04:17,880
but the common theme today is that all

110
00:04:17,880 --> 00:04:20,399
of those existing vulnerabilities of

111
00:04:20,399 --> 00:04:22,320
course are covered but a lot are not

112
00:04:22,320 --> 00:04:24,479
known and we have just had two weeks ago

113
00:04:24,479 --> 00:04:26,880
I think that huge problem with VMware

114
00:04:26,880 --> 00:04:29,220
esxi where the patch was actually

115
00:04:29,220 --> 00:04:31,139
available for about two years and still

116
00:04:31,139 --> 00:04:32,699
today we see a lot of problems because

117
00:04:32,699 --> 00:04:34,440
there's also that time pressure it's

118
00:04:34,440 --> 00:04:36,960
also more more of the CVS and the

119
00:04:36,960 --> 00:04:39,180
patches to be deployed so what we are

120
00:04:39,180 --> 00:04:41,520
trying to resolve is the challenge of

121
00:04:41,520 --> 00:04:44,880
the unknown that existing TTP for

122
00:04:44,880 --> 00:04:46,680
instance or technique but which is

123
00:04:46,680 --> 00:04:48,600
wrapped in a new paper

124
00:04:48,600 --> 00:04:50,759
because we all know it's not always the

125
00:04:50,759 --> 00:04:52,380
new wheel or the new wheel that is

126
00:04:52,380 --> 00:04:55,500
invented right a lot of those tools the

127
00:04:55,500 --> 00:04:57,180
mimikats of this world the Cobalt

128
00:04:57,180 --> 00:04:58,800
strikes and all of those are being

129
00:04:58,800 --> 00:05:00,540
reused they're available as a service

130
00:05:00,540 --> 00:05:02,460
you can really download them as a

131
00:05:02,460 --> 00:05:04,560
package but we're always going to create

132
00:05:04,560 --> 00:05:06,479
a new malware that is continuously

133
00:05:06,479 --> 00:05:08,940
changing and so rather than looking for

134
00:05:08,940 --> 00:05:11,580
the individual indicators this is where

135
00:05:11,580 --> 00:05:13,620
the fundamental changes what Vector is

136
00:05:13,620 --> 00:05:16,020
trying to bring and so we'd like to

137
00:05:16,020 --> 00:05:17,940
cover actually the unknown and we also

138
00:05:17,940 --> 00:05:19,919
have been getting the confirmations from

139
00:05:19,919 --> 00:05:22,440
the field that that is where the problem

140
00:05:22,440 --> 00:05:25,800
lies and so we would like to break the

141
00:05:25,800 --> 00:05:28,320
spiral of the unknown you could say and

142
00:05:28,320 --> 00:05:31,800
for that we would like to focus on less

143
00:05:31,800 --> 00:05:34,979
alerts that will come still we see a lot

144
00:05:34,979 --> 00:05:38,220
of data but the automation will help to

145
00:05:38,220 --> 00:05:41,460
deliver more context as well as less but

146
00:05:41,460 --> 00:05:44,220
High Fidelity detections so this is a

147
00:05:44,220 --> 00:05:45,900
lot of marketing you could say but that

148
00:05:45,900 --> 00:05:47,940
is the Cornerstone of 10 years of work

149
00:05:47,940 --> 00:05:49,919
of which I will show you also a couple

150
00:05:49,919 --> 00:05:51,419
of the algorithms later on in the

151
00:05:51,419 --> 00:05:53,400
session so that you understand where it

152
00:05:53,400 --> 00:05:54,900
comes from

153
00:05:54,900 --> 00:05:57,900
really what we need to do we need to

154
00:05:57,900 --> 00:06:00,479
deliver an attack signal and with that

155
00:06:00,479 --> 00:06:02,699
intelligence you can automate the

156
00:06:02,699 --> 00:06:04,620
detection the triage the prioritization

157
00:06:04,620 --> 00:06:07,020
and as such the work that you have to do

158
00:06:07,020 --> 00:06:09,780
in your sock and it is all to arm the

159
00:06:09,780 --> 00:06:13,740
humans you cannot expect in Real uh uh

160
00:06:13,740 --> 00:06:16,560
honesty you cannot expect a tool to

161
00:06:16,560 --> 00:06:19,199
bring you an attack to surface you will

162
00:06:19,199 --> 00:06:21,240
always have to do a lot of that work we

163
00:06:21,240 --> 00:06:23,100
can help you but the analyst is the

164
00:06:23,100 --> 00:06:24,840
Cornerstone and I hope that we always

165
00:06:24,840 --> 00:06:27,479
keep that in mind and so to arm the

166
00:06:27,479 --> 00:06:29,699
intelligence of the human persons that

167
00:06:29,699 --> 00:06:32,460
is where we can accelerate a lot and we

168
00:06:32,460 --> 00:06:34,440
will cover all of the items the initial

169
00:06:34,440 --> 00:06:36,660
detection where the stock can be fit fit

170
00:06:36,660 --> 00:06:39,000
with a meaningful alerts but also is

171
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:41,520
going to be a lot of metadata and I have

172
00:06:41,520 --> 00:06:43,560
a surprise by the end additional tools

173
00:06:43,560 --> 00:06:45,539
available to do the hunting and the

174
00:06:45,539 --> 00:06:47,460
validation and the research

175
00:06:47,460 --> 00:06:50,400
there's three areas that we kind of are

176
00:06:50,400 --> 00:06:53,280
covering in in our overall story which

177
00:06:53,280 --> 00:06:55,139
is first and above all when you talk

178
00:06:55,139 --> 00:06:57,539
about an Enterprise today being that a

179
00:06:57,539 --> 00:06:59,759
large one a small one a governmental

180
00:06:59,759 --> 00:07:02,520
environment a real business there is

181
00:07:02,520 --> 00:07:06,000
always multiple areas of uh technology

182
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:08,100
being used there is of course identity

183
00:07:08,100 --> 00:07:10,500
more and more this is centralized like

184
00:07:10,500 --> 00:07:13,259
the active directory or the the single

185
00:07:13,259 --> 00:07:14,759
sign-on capabilities

186
00:07:14,759 --> 00:07:17,160
you have of course a big footprint of

187
00:07:17,160 --> 00:07:20,220
SAS especially after covet M365 and zoom

188
00:07:20,220 --> 00:07:21,539
in all of those have been growing

189
00:07:21,539 --> 00:07:23,460
quickly there's been a big lift and

190
00:07:23,460 --> 00:07:26,160
shift from m-prem to IAS environments

191
00:07:26,160 --> 00:07:29,580
AWS Azure gcp but on top we still have

192
00:07:29,580 --> 00:07:31,860
the traditional Network as well a lot of

193
00:07:31,860 --> 00:07:34,800
that is physically but also virtually

194
00:07:34,800 --> 00:07:37,979
been scaling and as such it is not

195
00:07:37,979 --> 00:07:40,199
possible today to say like oh we should

196
00:07:40,199 --> 00:07:42,180
install one thing there and another

197
00:07:42,180 --> 00:07:43,800
thing there and I would try to bring it

198
00:07:43,800 --> 00:07:45,900
together that is failing that's what we

199
00:07:45,900 --> 00:07:47,460
have been doing all those years that's

200
00:07:47,460 --> 00:07:49,440
where we have been building the seams

201
00:07:49,440 --> 00:07:50,759
where we have been trying to build all

202
00:07:50,759 --> 00:07:53,340
those use cases those correlation rules

203
00:07:53,340 --> 00:07:56,160
and we always have to catch up and there

204
00:07:56,160 --> 00:07:58,440
is no consistency and yes there is one

205
00:07:58,440 --> 00:08:00,900
point that in the entire you could say

206
00:08:00,900 --> 00:08:03,419
stack of technology in an Enterprise we

207
00:08:03,419 --> 00:08:04,800
do not cover and that's the direct

208
00:08:04,800 --> 00:08:07,199
endpoint we're a technology that is

209
00:08:07,199 --> 00:08:08,819
fully invisible in a network we take

210
00:08:08,819 --> 00:08:12,000
just a network span port or a tap or we

211
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:14,280
use an API when it comes on cloud but we

212
00:08:14,280 --> 00:08:16,500
see everything but this also means we

213
00:08:16,500 --> 00:08:18,720
are not to be evaded we are not going to

214
00:08:18,720 --> 00:08:21,840
be tested and then checked on what can

215
00:08:21,840 --> 00:08:23,400
we do to stop for instance that service

216
00:08:23,400 --> 00:08:25,560
that's not going to be possible but that

217
00:08:25,560 --> 00:08:27,539
also means that we don't see the

218
00:08:27,539 --> 00:08:28,860
reconnaissance for instance that could

219
00:08:28,860 --> 00:08:30,720
happen on an endpoint and so we

220
00:08:30,720 --> 00:08:32,580
typically would always advise to have

221
00:08:32,580 --> 00:08:34,200
both a network as well as an endpoint

222
00:08:34,200 --> 00:08:36,419
coverage together bring that in a sauce

223
00:08:36,419 --> 00:08:39,539
in a in an overall probably soar

224
00:08:39,539 --> 00:08:41,760
capability so you can actually have the

225
00:08:41,760 --> 00:08:43,200
holistic View

226
00:08:43,200 --> 00:08:46,500
what we do is listen to EDR for instance

227
00:08:46,500 --> 00:08:48,959
to get information about endpoints so we

228
00:08:48,959 --> 00:08:50,700
can also bring meaningful names to the

229
00:08:50,700 --> 00:08:53,279
detections of the machines and that is

230
00:08:53,279 --> 00:08:54,779
very much helping as well so attack

231
00:08:54,779 --> 00:08:57,540
coverage is very important but then

232
00:08:57,540 --> 00:08:59,519
there's also that signal Clarity and the

233
00:08:59,519 --> 00:09:01,200
control that we need to do and all of

234
00:09:01,200 --> 00:09:03,240
that can be used for instance by

235
00:09:03,240 --> 00:09:05,880
Partners to build a service around it to

236
00:09:05,880 --> 00:09:08,160
manage it we can talk about the TDR

237
00:09:08,160 --> 00:09:09,839
platform so threat detection response

238
00:09:09,839 --> 00:09:11,459
platform and then of course there's an

239
00:09:11,459 --> 00:09:13,860
ecosystem either something that is off

240
00:09:13,860 --> 00:09:16,260
the shelf like the seams the source of

241
00:09:16,260 --> 00:09:18,060
this world but if you would be willing

242
00:09:18,060 --> 00:09:20,720
to build your own scripts and employ

243
00:09:20,720 --> 00:09:23,880
applications to integrate with response

244
00:09:23,880 --> 00:09:26,220
Technologies being that NAX being that

245
00:09:26,220 --> 00:09:27,899
firewalls it's all going to be available

246
00:09:27,899 --> 00:09:30,120
so this is really an open capability

247
00:09:30,120 --> 00:09:32,640
that gives you input from where you can

248
00:09:32,640 --> 00:09:33,420
work

249
00:09:33,420 --> 00:09:36,360
and I'm nearing in also really on I

250
00:09:36,360 --> 00:09:38,279
thought I had stopped all of my

251
00:09:38,279 --> 00:09:41,459
applications apparently not the calendar

252
00:09:41,459 --> 00:09:43,200
application

253
00:09:43,200 --> 00:09:45,480
um so what we'd really try to do is the

254
00:09:45,480 --> 00:09:47,760
uh the intelligence of the signal and we

255
00:09:47,760 --> 00:09:51,060
have three forms of AI that we have been

256
00:09:51,060 --> 00:09:53,519
implementing for about 10 years we've

257
00:09:53,519 --> 00:09:56,399
been working on AI driven detections and

258
00:09:56,399 --> 00:09:57,839
what is the Cornerstone of that is to

259
00:09:57,839 --> 00:10:00,480
think like an attacker rather than to

260
00:10:00,480 --> 00:10:02,519
look for an individual ioc based on

261
00:10:02,519 --> 00:10:05,720
either an IP or a very specific

262
00:10:05,720 --> 00:10:08,580
fingerprint of a malware package or a

263
00:10:08,580 --> 00:10:10,620
file or itself now we're going to try to

264
00:10:10,620 --> 00:10:13,560
look at what is the entire cycle that an

265
00:10:13,560 --> 00:10:15,420
attacker has to do to get into a network

266
00:10:15,420 --> 00:10:17,820
right we all know that the phishing is

267
00:10:17,820 --> 00:10:19,920
typically the first one or the malicious

268
00:10:19,920 --> 00:10:21,540
file that is being double clicked but

269
00:10:21,540 --> 00:10:22,920
then you land where do you land

270
00:10:22,920 --> 00:10:24,959
somewhere in the network on a machine is

271
00:10:24,959 --> 00:10:27,240
that close to the credentials or the

272
00:10:27,240 --> 00:10:29,100
data that you want to steal very

273
00:10:29,100 --> 00:10:30,959
unlikely you will have to find your way

274
00:10:30,959 --> 00:10:33,180
there right it is very much like

275
00:10:33,180 --> 00:10:36,720
dropping a parachutist in workfire after

276
00:10:36,720 --> 00:10:39,000
the lines and he has to figure out how

277
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:43,140
phone home and tell the the command the

278
00:10:43,140 --> 00:10:45,480
intelligence of the field that's all of

279
00:10:45,480 --> 00:10:46,920
the things that will happen here so we

280
00:10:46,920 --> 00:10:49,260
also do a lot of research in

281
00:10:49,260 --> 00:10:51,060
understanding what that is and rather

282
00:10:51,060 --> 00:10:53,339
than working on an indicator for a

283
00:10:53,339 --> 00:10:55,740
specific parameter we will be looking at

284
00:10:55,740 --> 00:10:58,560
the behavior right a behavior of lateral

285
00:10:58,560 --> 00:11:00,779
movement behavior of reconnaissance and

286
00:11:00,779 --> 00:11:02,160
these are typically well described

287
00:11:02,160 --> 00:11:05,940
already in miter so we cover about 97 of

288
00:11:05,940 --> 00:11:07,980
the miter framework with all of the

289
00:11:07,980 --> 00:11:09,839
coverage that we do

290
00:11:09,839 --> 00:11:13,079
but we have also been able to drive with

291
00:11:13,079 --> 00:11:16,019
the AI and AI of course as a swear word

292
00:11:16,019 --> 00:11:18,000
I know that as well it's the data

293
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:19,260
science and the Machine learning we

294
00:11:19,260 --> 00:11:21,540
apply also we have been able to do that

295
00:11:21,540 --> 00:11:24,959
on triaging because even AI driven

296
00:11:24,959 --> 00:11:27,720
detections are not false positive less

297
00:11:27,720 --> 00:11:30,420
right there is going to be some of those

298
00:11:30,420 --> 00:11:33,540
false positive or benign detections that

299
00:11:33,540 --> 00:11:35,279
you do not want to see because they're

300
00:11:35,279 --> 00:11:37,500
not dangerous because in the context of

301
00:11:37,500 --> 00:11:39,540
where they are used and so for that

302
00:11:39,540 --> 00:11:41,339
we've also been building that technology

303
00:11:41,339 --> 00:11:44,160
to start looking into finding that

304
00:11:44,160 --> 00:11:47,940
really unique detection and not one that

305
00:11:47,940 --> 00:11:50,640
is very suspicious but it's over is

306
00:11:50,640 --> 00:11:52,560
happening all over the place you don't

307
00:11:52,560 --> 00:11:55,500
want the analyst to have to dry three

308
00:11:55,500 --> 00:11:56,700
eyes them out in the interface

309
00:11:56,700 --> 00:11:58,860
continuously there you can find again

310
00:11:58,860 --> 00:12:01,019
machine learning Technologies algorithms

311
00:12:01,019 --> 00:12:03,240
that can find the common components

312
00:12:03,240 --> 00:12:05,760
bring them together filter them out

313
00:12:05,760 --> 00:12:08,339
but then last but not least it's the

314
00:12:08,339 --> 00:12:10,260
driven prior is prioritizing your

315
00:12:10,260 --> 00:12:11,399
detections

316
00:12:11,399 --> 00:12:14,220
of course you can say I've seen 20 scans

317
00:12:14,220 --> 00:12:17,700
on that host is that really dangerous I

318
00:12:17,700 --> 00:12:19,380
guess not because that could be your

319
00:12:19,380 --> 00:12:21,660
vulnerability scanner as well but at the

320
00:12:21,660 --> 00:12:23,940
same time if I do see also from that

321
00:12:23,940 --> 00:12:26,640
machine an SSL connection going on that

322
00:12:26,640 --> 00:12:29,399
is suspicious right could be very well a

323
00:12:29,399 --> 00:12:31,680
C2 and based on the pattern on the

324
00:12:31,680 --> 00:12:33,839
network we kind of recognize that we

325
00:12:33,839 --> 00:12:35,100
already have two phases of the attack

326
00:12:35,100 --> 00:12:37,380
kill chain and then if on top of that

327
00:12:37,380 --> 00:12:39,240
you start to see that that machine is

328
00:12:39,240 --> 00:12:42,240
starting to use user accounts that have

329
00:12:42,240 --> 00:12:44,760
higher privileges do destinations it

330
00:12:44,760 --> 00:12:47,579
never did before now it starts to come

331
00:12:47,579 --> 00:12:50,459
together right so this is much more

332
00:12:50,459 --> 00:12:52,500
meaningful than to look into all the

333
00:12:52,500 --> 00:12:55,320
individual ones then now to say okay all

334
00:12:55,320 --> 00:12:57,120
these three correlated back to the same

335
00:12:57,120 --> 00:12:59,100
account or the same machine Let's Now

336
00:12:59,100 --> 00:13:01,380
bump that into the queue of the analyst

337
00:13:01,380 --> 00:13:03,959
so that he can do a proper investigation

338
00:13:03,959 --> 00:13:05,820
and that is really where the

339
00:13:05,820 --> 00:13:08,220
prioritization will work and what we are

340
00:13:08,220 --> 00:13:11,100
doing is to even give input or allow

341
00:13:11,100 --> 00:13:13,320
input from the analyst or the Enterprise

342
00:13:13,320 --> 00:13:16,680
by for instance defining what are the

343
00:13:16,680 --> 00:13:18,899
critical Assets in your environment put

344
00:13:18,899 --> 00:13:20,940
them in a group and if something happens

345
00:13:20,940 --> 00:13:23,459
on those without the same conditions as

346
00:13:23,459 --> 00:13:25,740
to another but because of the priority

347
00:13:25,740 --> 00:13:28,079
of that account or machine you will bump

348
00:13:28,079 --> 00:13:31,680
it higher or if you see that it's not

349
00:13:31,680 --> 00:13:34,860
just reconnaissance but a primarily

350
00:13:34,860 --> 00:13:36,360
lateral movements with the command and

351
00:13:36,360 --> 00:13:38,760
control so the danger itself is bigger

352
00:13:38,760 --> 00:13:41,100
it will also bump in priority and I

353
00:13:41,100 --> 00:13:42,600
would just give you one screenshot later

354
00:13:42,600 --> 00:13:44,700
on just to give you an idea what this is

355
00:13:44,700 --> 00:13:47,700
we're not going to do a lot of that

356
00:13:47,700 --> 00:13:51,000
mirror but we try to give a lot of tools

357
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:53,760
as well as results to the analysts

358
00:13:53,760 --> 00:13:55,440
but then of course when you have found

359
00:13:55,440 --> 00:13:58,980
something you need to do an act you need

360
00:13:58,980 --> 00:14:00,959
to do something you need to act on that

361
00:14:00,959 --> 00:14:04,139
a lot of Technology will now say oh we

362
00:14:04,139 --> 00:14:05,880
do this automatically we will block the

363
00:14:05,880 --> 00:14:08,760
host we will add a block rule in the

364
00:14:08,760 --> 00:14:11,519
network so that the user now is or that

365
00:14:11,519 --> 00:14:13,860
machine is no longer dangerous it

366
00:14:13,860 --> 00:14:16,019
doesn't work like that because first and

367
00:14:16,019 --> 00:14:18,420
above all an attacker is and I think you

368
00:14:18,420 --> 00:14:20,040
guys know that probably better than I do

369
00:14:20,040 --> 00:14:21,660
is never going to have just one Channel

370
00:14:21,660 --> 00:14:23,639
evil f is backup

371
00:14:23,639 --> 00:14:26,160
connections right if one is killed there

372
00:14:26,160 --> 00:14:27,360
is another if there is one machine

373
00:14:27,360 --> 00:14:28,740
that's being killed there is an order

374
00:14:28,740 --> 00:14:30,839
right so if it is a persistent attack

375
00:14:30,839 --> 00:14:33,120
it's just not possible to just kill one

376
00:14:33,120 --> 00:14:34,860
you'll have to investigate you'll have

377
00:14:34,860 --> 00:14:36,839
to do a proper action and a proper

378
00:14:36,839 --> 00:14:39,060
action is to integrate with playbooks

379
00:14:39,060 --> 00:14:41,399
and probably those playbooks either have

380
00:14:41,399 --> 00:14:44,579
been pre-built or you as a team has been

381
00:14:44,579 --> 00:14:45,959
building these and would like to

382
00:14:45,959 --> 00:14:47,880
interact with the information from for

383
00:14:47,880 --> 00:14:50,639
instance such a tool and then apply the

384
00:14:50,639 --> 00:14:52,279
responses that you would like to so

385
00:14:52,279 --> 00:14:55,019
integrate investigation so you can

386
00:14:55,019 --> 00:14:57,120
really start looking into the metadata

387
00:14:57,120 --> 00:14:59,699
of all of the connections because that

388
00:14:59,699 --> 00:15:02,220
one single detection maybe was followed

389
00:15:02,220 --> 00:15:05,040
or pre-approved before that were other

390
00:15:05,040 --> 00:15:06,600
actions so you would like to figure it

391
00:15:06,600 --> 00:15:08,639
out you maybe want to automate the

392
00:15:08,639 --> 00:15:10,380
workflows and then of course you would

393
00:15:10,380 --> 00:15:11,880
like to do a Target that the response

394
00:15:11,880 --> 00:15:13,800
could be in account lockdown but

395
00:15:13,800 --> 00:15:15,720
typically that's going to be part of

396
00:15:15,720 --> 00:15:17,820
your playbook so

397
00:15:17,820 --> 00:15:20,220
I hope checking the clock indeed I

398
00:15:20,220 --> 00:15:21,959
didn't take much more than 15 minutes to

399
00:15:21,959 --> 00:15:25,380
kind of introduce what the purpose is of

400
00:15:25,380 --> 00:15:27,959
Vectra we do this for over 10 years this

401
00:15:27,959 --> 00:15:30,360
is the only product or only platform we

402
00:15:30,360 --> 00:15:32,639
do so this is the butter the bread and

403
00:15:32,639 --> 00:15:36,060
the butter of our organization

404
00:15:36,060 --> 00:15:38,639
how do we do it because that's the

405
00:15:38,639 --> 00:15:40,860
question always of course and I'm

406
00:15:40,860 --> 00:15:42,660
zooming in so first and above all this

407
00:15:42,660 --> 00:15:44,699
and let me see if I can maybe close this

408
00:15:44,699 --> 00:15:47,420
one because it's

409
00:15:47,639 --> 00:15:49,320
there we go

410
00:15:49,320 --> 00:15:51,980
so

411
00:15:54,600 --> 00:15:56,579
this is the interface for instance that

412
00:15:56,579 --> 00:15:58,380
you would see as I said I'm not going to

413
00:15:58,380 --> 00:16:00,060
do a demo here so I'm just going to give

414
00:16:00,060 --> 00:16:02,160
you just the idea where you have a

415
00:16:02,160 --> 00:16:04,560
response view where you get a clarified

416
00:16:04,560 --> 00:16:07,260
or a prioritized in this case an account

417
00:16:07,260 --> 00:16:09,720
which gives you information like hey

418
00:16:09,720 --> 00:16:11,399
this is the account that what data has

419
00:16:11,399 --> 00:16:13,139
happened what was the rating and for

420
00:16:13,139 --> 00:16:15,000
instance the entity so this in this case

421
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:17,279
account could be a machine is of medium

422
00:16:17,279 --> 00:16:19,260
importance but because of all of the

423
00:16:19,260 --> 00:16:21,660
attack ratings and the profile that has

424
00:16:21,660 --> 00:16:23,579
been assigned to it and the velocity so

425
00:16:23,579 --> 00:16:25,500
a lot of different steps that were

426
00:16:25,500 --> 00:16:27,360
happening at the same time we bumped

427
00:16:27,360 --> 00:16:28,980
this one with the AI into the triage

428
00:16:28,980 --> 00:16:31,380
filter right so now you can work on it

429
00:16:31,380 --> 00:16:33,540
and we immediately give the indicators

430
00:16:33,540 --> 00:16:36,060
where you can now look into and what you

431
00:16:36,060 --> 00:16:37,800
can do and then from there

432
00:16:37,800 --> 00:16:40,019
you can even look into all of the

433
00:16:40,019 --> 00:16:42,240
surrounding information of what has this

434
00:16:42,240 --> 00:16:43,800
account been doing in this case in an

435
00:16:43,800 --> 00:16:45,660
M365 has it been logging in multiple

436
00:16:45,660 --> 00:16:48,120
times as it had other detections was a

437
00:16:48,120 --> 00:16:51,300
changing exchange rules Etc so a lot of

438
00:16:51,300 --> 00:16:53,220
the questions you would ask yourself are

439
00:16:53,220 --> 00:16:54,779
kind of built in into an instant

440
00:16:54,779 --> 00:16:57,899
investigation workflow at once so that

441
00:16:57,899 --> 00:17:00,420
is to help you to navigate all of those

442
00:17:00,420 --> 00:17:02,639
detections and prioritize and bring them

443
00:17:02,639 --> 00:17:04,980
together into one and then in a tree of

444
00:17:04,980 --> 00:17:07,380
priority you know what to work so this

445
00:17:07,380 --> 00:17:09,599
is a clear actionable list

446
00:17:09,599 --> 00:17:11,760
where you as an analyst log in this is

447
00:17:11,760 --> 00:17:13,980
what I have to do today and then you can

448
00:17:13,980 --> 00:17:15,900
have others that will then be for

449
00:17:15,900 --> 00:17:17,880
instance in the hunt page other machines

450
00:17:17,880 --> 00:17:19,439
with detections if you have time left

451
00:17:19,439 --> 00:17:22,260
that you can start looking into

452
00:17:22,260 --> 00:17:23,939
but how do we come to all those

453
00:17:23,939 --> 00:17:27,480
detections as I said over 10 years

454
00:17:27,480 --> 00:17:30,059
and the prime components we have is

455
00:17:30,059 --> 00:17:33,179
security researches and data scientists

456
00:17:33,179 --> 00:17:36,000
right the security researchers are

457
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:38,520
people like a lot of you probably in the

458
00:17:38,520 --> 00:17:41,340
room that have a lot of skills in

459
00:17:41,340 --> 00:17:44,039
figuring out uh how maybe I could

460
00:17:44,039 --> 00:17:46,559
intrude uh what are maybe new tactics

461
00:17:46,559 --> 00:17:49,200
that I could use or procedures and so

462
00:17:49,200 --> 00:17:50,700
they will really really do all of that

463
00:17:50,700 --> 00:17:54,179
work and they will start to test it they

464
00:17:54,179 --> 00:17:56,220
will build prototypes and if they

465
00:17:56,220 --> 00:17:59,039
succeed in breaching something and they

466
00:17:59,039 --> 00:18:01,200
can consistently do that they will start

467
00:18:01,200 --> 00:18:03,900
to hand over that information to the

468
00:18:03,900 --> 00:18:05,940
data scientists because with that

469
00:18:05,940 --> 00:18:07,919
consistency that they approach and try

470
00:18:07,919 --> 00:18:10,740
to get they have a behavior kind of

471
00:18:10,740 --> 00:18:13,620
approach so that is what the detection

472
00:18:13,620 --> 00:18:15,480
would like to focus on we have

473
00:18:15,480 --> 00:18:16,860
detections that are in the product for

474
00:18:16,860 --> 00:18:18,360
over eight years already that have not

475
00:18:18,360 --> 00:18:20,940
been really cheap changed so there is no

476
00:18:20,940 --> 00:18:23,340
updates no custom things to do because

477
00:18:23,340 --> 00:18:25,380
we look at the behavior the outcome you

478
00:18:25,380 --> 00:18:27,419
could say over vulnerability that is

479
00:18:27,419 --> 00:18:30,360
being abused not finding the abuse of

480
00:18:30,360 --> 00:18:31,740
the vulnerability itself there's other

481
00:18:31,740 --> 00:18:34,380
tools for that and so when that the data

482
00:18:34,380 --> 00:18:36,780
science will start to build a model and

483
00:18:36,780 --> 00:18:39,780
they will use of course I'll algorithms

484
00:18:39,780 --> 00:18:42,000
for that and now we come into the

485
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:44,520
detection of the discussion about Ai and

486
00:18:44,520 --> 00:18:46,860
what is AI so machine learning data

487
00:18:46,860 --> 00:18:50,280
science we are going to have a wild and

488
00:18:50,280 --> 00:18:52,440
a broad pattern of machine learning and

489
00:18:52,440 --> 00:18:54,780
algorithms available so our data

490
00:18:54,780 --> 00:18:56,940
scientists live closely to Boston and

491
00:18:56,940 --> 00:18:59,460
have all mostly a PhD degree of the

492
00:18:59,460 --> 00:19:02,400
Boston University work really on that

493
00:19:02,400 --> 00:19:05,520
thing and they will start analyzing what

494
00:19:05,520 --> 00:19:07,740
is the algorithm to use and there is no

495
00:19:07,740 --> 00:19:09,960
free lunch you cannot say just going to

496
00:19:09,960 --> 00:19:12,539
use always a be Asian model it's not

497
00:19:12,539 --> 00:19:14,340
working like that because you're not

498
00:19:14,340 --> 00:19:16,140
looking for the outlier

499
00:19:16,140 --> 00:19:18,539
you're looking for not anomalous

500
00:19:18,539 --> 00:19:21,360
Behavior but suspicious Behavior so you

501
00:19:21,360 --> 00:19:23,160
need to tailor it and that is exactly

502
00:19:23,160 --> 00:19:26,100
what we do here so we test it we apply

503
00:19:26,100 --> 00:19:28,440
it and we go back to that research and

504
00:19:28,440 --> 00:19:30,660
that model and that prototype to see how

505
00:19:30,660 --> 00:19:32,700
well it is being detected

506
00:19:32,700 --> 00:19:35,940
you're welcome if you want

507
00:19:35,940 --> 00:19:37,860
um so once we have

508
00:19:37,860 --> 00:19:39,780
um all of those detections and we have

509
00:19:39,780 --> 00:19:42,419
validated it it will start to be also

510
00:19:42,419 --> 00:19:44,760
productized only then we would like to

511
00:19:44,760 --> 00:19:46,440
know what do we need to visualize what

512
00:19:46,440 --> 00:19:48,240
do we need to tell the analysts based on

513
00:19:48,240 --> 00:19:49,980
all of those detections so that's that

514
00:19:49,980 --> 00:19:52,620
work of the designers on the ux only

515
00:19:52,620 --> 00:19:55,080
then we will start to put it out in test

516
00:19:55,080 --> 00:19:57,360
environments only before we do a full

517
00:19:57,360 --> 00:20:00,000
release so in some cases especially when

518
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:01,980
it is a completely new model that's

519
00:20:01,980 --> 00:20:04,440
never been done before it could actually

520
00:20:04,440 --> 00:20:06,960
take one sometimes two years before we

521
00:20:06,960 --> 00:20:09,539
really can productize this so this is

522
00:20:09,539 --> 00:20:12,120
not just something you do between lunch

523
00:20:12,120 --> 00:20:14,460
and dinner this is really taking an

524
00:20:14,460 --> 00:20:16,559
approach and also requires dedication

525
00:20:16,559 --> 00:20:18,840
from an organization because you have to

526
00:20:18,840 --> 00:20:21,780
allow to fail right you have to allow to

527
00:20:21,780 --> 00:20:24,539
fail mostly because there's only one

528
00:20:24,539 --> 00:20:26,760
time that you will get close to a

529
00:20:26,760 --> 00:20:27,660
solution

530
00:20:27,660 --> 00:20:30,539
and so once we have done that and this

531
00:20:30,539 --> 00:20:31,980
is where you probably recognize the

532
00:20:31,980 --> 00:20:34,500
miter framework a little bit we have of

533
00:20:34,500 --> 00:20:37,380
course models for a lot of the different

534
00:20:37,380 --> 00:20:39,179
phases you see the command and control

535
00:20:39,179 --> 00:20:41,100
we have the reconnaissance phase the

536
00:20:41,100 --> 00:20:42,780
lateral and of course Excel phase that

537
00:20:42,780 --> 00:20:46,440
is the uh you could say the end game

538
00:20:46,440 --> 00:20:48,059
um another question by the way just to

539
00:20:48,059 --> 00:20:51,000
take to take a little uh side tour I had

540
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:53,340
in that webinar earlier uh this week was

541
00:20:53,340 --> 00:20:55,440
what do you think and that was a

542
00:20:55,440 --> 00:20:57,900
question to the audience is the the big

543
00:20:57,900 --> 00:21:00,780
or what is where do you have the most

544
00:21:00,780 --> 00:21:04,380
fear from from DDOS from a data leak

545
00:21:04,380 --> 00:21:07,440
from phishing from ransomware or from an

546
00:21:07,440 --> 00:21:10,559
apt or other no one took order so that

547
00:21:10,559 --> 00:21:12,960
was good right but the majority to

548
00:21:12,960 --> 00:21:14,700
ransomware

549
00:21:14,700 --> 00:21:17,400
and for me that was an eye-opener

550
00:21:17,400 --> 00:21:20,100
because if that is your fear

551
00:21:20,100 --> 00:21:23,220
then you're late late in your reaction

552
00:21:23,220 --> 00:21:25,020
because that's the end game that is the

553
00:21:25,020 --> 00:21:27,120
x-fill that is the the double extortion

554
00:21:27,120 --> 00:21:29,460
maybe all the work that the attacker had

555
00:21:29,460 --> 00:21:32,039
to do you have left and untouched that

556
00:21:32,039 --> 00:21:33,539
phishing email is the start of the

557
00:21:33,539 --> 00:21:37,140
campaign right that DDOS is maybe the

558
00:21:37,140 --> 00:21:40,140
smoke mirror that was put up to get into

559
00:21:40,140 --> 00:21:43,080
your network right but the APT that only

560
00:21:43,080 --> 00:21:45,840
got like 15 I think of the votes that is

561
00:21:45,840 --> 00:21:47,580
the real threat and it doesn't have to

562
00:21:47,580 --> 00:21:51,480
be a state state uh sponsored uh problem

563
00:21:51,480 --> 00:21:54,480
it could also be really uh the

564
00:21:54,480 --> 00:21:56,159
traditional attackers just looking for

565
00:21:56,159 --> 00:21:57,720
the money but there is always an

566
00:21:57,720 --> 00:21:59,460
objective and that is I think something

567
00:21:59,460 --> 00:22:01,799
you all know but a lot of the people we

568
00:22:01,799 --> 00:22:03,780
talk to not always know there's an

569
00:22:03,780 --> 00:22:06,299
objective for an attacker it is not

570
00:22:06,299 --> 00:22:08,760
doing that out of fun of course there is

571
00:22:08,760 --> 00:22:11,100
some fun for some I guess but they're

572
00:22:11,100 --> 00:22:13,140
money driven typically or they're it's

573
00:22:13,140 --> 00:22:15,840
Espionage it's as simple as that right

574
00:22:15,840 --> 00:22:18,120
and that doesn't happen overnight so

575
00:22:18,120 --> 00:22:21,720
that is why all of these tips matter and

576
00:22:21,720 --> 00:22:24,299
that you do have to have a holistic

577
00:22:24,299 --> 00:22:26,220
coverage for that

578
00:22:26,220 --> 00:22:27,480
and so

579
00:22:27,480 --> 00:22:29,220
in the remainder of the session what I'd

580
00:22:29,220 --> 00:22:31,620
like to do is to actually Hoover in or

581
00:22:31,620 --> 00:22:34,260
zoom in on the hidden https tunnel and

582
00:22:34,260 --> 00:22:36,780
paa like we call that privilege anomaly

583
00:22:36,780 --> 00:22:38,640
and I'd like to give you a little bit of

584
00:22:38,640 --> 00:22:41,340
an idea on what is the work that we have

585
00:22:41,340 --> 00:22:44,159
done what is the result of those

586
00:22:44,159 --> 00:22:47,280
detections coming out so

587
00:22:47,280 --> 00:22:50,400
when we look at the https tunnel model

588
00:22:50,400 --> 00:22:52,620
or Beacon model right

589
00:22:52,620 --> 00:22:55,559
there's a vlog of course a lot a lot of

590
00:22:55,559 --> 00:22:57,419
tools that exist I gave a few already

591
00:22:57,419 --> 00:22:59,820
earlier how you have a Cobalt strike but

592
00:22:59,820 --> 00:23:01,500
there's so many others that could be

593
00:23:01,500 --> 00:23:03,900
used could be custom tunnels

594
00:23:03,900 --> 00:23:07,080
could be with front-ending uh domain

595
00:23:07,080 --> 00:23:09,299
front ending to to try to hide the real

596
00:23:09,299 --> 00:23:12,120
destinations more typically you would

597
00:23:12,120 --> 00:23:14,159
like to to use certificates as an attack

598
00:23:14,159 --> 00:23:16,620
at it or long existing so that you're

599
00:23:16,620 --> 00:23:19,159
not giving the chances to attackers or

600
00:23:19,159 --> 00:23:21,900
Defenders that just look for newly

601
00:23:21,900 --> 00:23:24,000
created or short-living certificates

602
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:26,640
that's that's way too easy so there's a

603
00:23:26,640 --> 00:23:28,980
lot of work that goes in and to make it

604
00:23:28,980 --> 00:23:32,220
actually go under the radar and so just

605
00:23:32,220 --> 00:23:36,000
looking for a match on an IP or a URL is

606
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:38,460
not working in the detection phase it

607
00:23:38,460 --> 00:23:41,159
works well when an attack is known and

608
00:23:41,159 --> 00:23:42,960
the threat Intel is being shared shared

609
00:23:42,960 --> 00:23:44,820
and then it makes a lot of sense okay

610
00:23:44,820 --> 00:23:46,679
now we know disk attack campaign is

611
00:23:46,679 --> 00:23:48,600
ongoing these are the destinations they

612
00:23:48,600 --> 00:23:50,760
use we have this fingerprint and if

613
00:23:50,760 --> 00:23:52,919
you're lucky and you have your metadata

614
00:23:52,919 --> 00:23:55,500
or your pcap information available you

615
00:23:55,500 --> 00:23:57,780
can go back in time and try to find it

616
00:23:57,780 --> 00:24:01,140
but that could be too late right so this

617
00:24:01,140 --> 00:24:03,120
is what we have been embarking on is to

618
00:24:03,120 --> 00:24:05,640
try to find the technology that can find

619
00:24:05,640 --> 00:24:07,980
a tunnel before it is known and so that

620
00:24:07,980 --> 00:24:10,380
you can actually find it and what we do

621
00:24:10,380 --> 00:24:12,840
is we've been feeding data

622
00:24:12,840 --> 00:24:14,400
I think you all know AI or machine

623
00:24:14,400 --> 00:24:16,260
learning data science is just big data

624
00:24:16,260 --> 00:24:18,120
agreed

625
00:24:18,120 --> 00:24:20,820
yes so it's big data you need compute

626
00:24:20,820 --> 00:24:23,820
and we use a lot of GPU for that because

627
00:24:23,820 --> 00:24:25,500
that is really where you can accelerate

628
00:24:25,500 --> 00:24:27,840
on that and what we have done is we have

629
00:24:27,840 --> 00:24:30,179
been implementing the lstm the Deep

630
00:24:30,179 --> 00:24:33,600
learning recurrent rural networks and

631
00:24:33,600 --> 00:24:36,360
why this type of network and inspection

632
00:24:36,360 --> 00:24:39,000
for the tunnel because you need to have

633
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:41,100
a loop you have to have a feedback loop

634
00:24:41,100 --> 00:24:43,860
coming back right so we're going to look

635
00:24:43,860 --> 00:24:47,159
and find unique patterns but at the same

636
00:24:47,159 --> 00:24:49,559
time we're going to see if they're

637
00:24:49,559 --> 00:24:51,240
recurring

638
00:24:51,240 --> 00:24:54,120
and that is something that requires data

639
00:24:54,120 --> 00:24:55,679
science this is not something you can do

640
00:24:55,679 --> 00:24:57,539
with the be Asian model so there's a

641
00:24:57,539 --> 00:25:00,000
well-known it is a is a there's a good

642
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:03,179
reason why we have taken this but on top

643
00:25:03,179 --> 00:25:05,820
of that we're also adding the time

644
00:25:05,820 --> 00:25:07,980
series so

645
00:25:07,980 --> 00:25:11,700
maybe one step back I need to do is when

646
00:25:11,700 --> 00:25:12,960
you look at where can you find

647
00:25:12,960 --> 00:25:16,559
information to analyze right it's either

648
00:25:16,559 --> 00:25:19,260
log files that you get over an API or

649
00:25:19,260 --> 00:25:22,140
maybe via a scene or it is the raw

650
00:25:22,140 --> 00:25:24,960
network data there are network data is

651
00:25:24,960 --> 00:25:26,580
where you can where can you find it on a

652
00:25:26,580 --> 00:25:28,559
span or a tab or a packet broker

653
00:25:28,559 --> 00:25:30,779
typically but if you would be storing

654
00:25:30,779 --> 00:25:32,760
all of that in rolling pcap

655
00:25:32,760 --> 00:25:34,559
that is where lots of problems have

656
00:25:34,559 --> 00:25:36,179
existed in the past it's just too much

657
00:25:36,179 --> 00:25:39,179
it's too cumbersome to search and to use

658
00:25:39,179 --> 00:25:42,080
so what we have decided is to actually

659
00:25:42,080 --> 00:25:45,000
immediately translate that data that we

660
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:46,799
collect on the network either on one or

661
00:25:46,799 --> 00:25:50,279
multiple sensors into the metadata and

662
00:25:50,279 --> 00:25:52,740
we kind of Base that on the Zeke brosek

663
00:25:52,740 --> 00:25:54,900
format but we have extended it with

664
00:25:54,900 --> 00:25:57,919
additional data and so you could say

665
00:25:57,919 --> 00:25:59,910
that uh

666
00:25:59,910 --> 00:26:01,380
[Music]

667
00:26:01,380 --> 00:26:04,140
patch of data that is kind of reducing

668
00:26:04,140 --> 00:26:05,820
the original data to maybe two and a

669
00:26:05,820 --> 00:26:07,980
half percent of the original size is

670
00:26:07,980 --> 00:26:10,200
being recorded and centralized and

671
00:26:10,200 --> 00:26:12,659
stored there and there we apply the

672
00:26:12,659 --> 00:26:14,820
searches on so that's what I quickly

673
00:26:14,820 --> 00:26:17,820
needed to explain because we say it is

674
00:26:17,820 --> 00:26:19,799
indeed based on project but it is much

675
00:26:19,799 --> 00:26:22,200
more enhanced than what that is and so

676
00:26:22,200 --> 00:26:24,299
with all of this work what now can

677
00:26:24,299 --> 00:26:26,700
happen is that we are starting to find

678
00:26:26,700 --> 00:26:29,580
the commonalities but also the the

679
00:26:29,580 --> 00:26:33,240
deviations from the patterns and so when

680
00:26:33,240 --> 00:26:35,220
you go back to a very simple drawing

681
00:26:35,220 --> 00:26:37,860
board and you try to draw how does a web

682
00:26:37,860 --> 00:26:40,500
connection look like on the wire it's

683
00:26:40,500 --> 00:26:42,840
actually as simple as this you have of

684
00:26:42,840 --> 00:26:45,480
course the time you have typically the

685
00:26:45,480 --> 00:26:48,419
send this is going in a browser typing

686
00:26:48,419 --> 00:26:51,480
URL you click go right you send a query

687
00:26:51,480 --> 00:26:55,020
that is typically not that much data but

688
00:26:55,020 --> 00:26:57,120
it gives you return and that data is

689
00:26:57,120 --> 00:26:58,320
going to be sent back and that's

690
00:26:58,320 --> 00:27:00,120
typically more than what you have been

691
00:27:00,120 --> 00:27:03,240
requesting so very very simple and will

692
00:27:03,240 --> 00:27:05,880
be quite visible on the network

693
00:27:05,880 --> 00:27:08,220
this is how a beacon would look like

694
00:27:08,220 --> 00:27:10,799
again very simplified but you

695
00:27:10,799 --> 00:27:12,419
immediately start to see the differences

696
00:27:12,419 --> 00:27:15,960
right rather than seeing always the

697
00:27:15,960 --> 00:27:18,840
request to be less than the response we

698
00:27:18,840 --> 00:27:21,360
start to see spikes the other way around

699
00:27:21,360 --> 00:27:24,240
we start to see that actually the

700
00:27:24,240 --> 00:27:27,179
request what we think is the request is

701
00:27:27,179 --> 00:27:28,500
actually higher

702
00:27:28,500 --> 00:27:32,460
and yes it is the request but we have a

703
00:27:32,460 --> 00:27:33,960
C2

704
00:27:33,960 --> 00:27:36,900
and so now the responses are going to

705
00:27:36,900 --> 00:27:39,600
come after the response the request and

706
00:27:39,600 --> 00:27:40,919
we see that the response is actually

707
00:27:40,919 --> 00:27:44,100
going out in this case bigger than what

708
00:27:44,100 --> 00:27:46,559
we normally would see from web traffic

709
00:27:46,559 --> 00:27:48,960
and we can even see the timelines and

710
00:27:48,960 --> 00:27:50,580
that's why that time series is so

711
00:27:50,580 --> 00:27:53,520
important to take into account and so

712
00:27:53,520 --> 00:27:56,340
now we can start to map it to the C2

713
00:27:56,340 --> 00:27:59,220
where we see an attacker comment there's

714
00:27:59,220 --> 00:28:01,679
no need to do any decryption because

715
00:28:01,679 --> 00:28:04,559
first you will not be able typically to

716
00:28:04,559 --> 00:28:07,919
intercept that it's custom encryption

717
00:28:07,919 --> 00:28:09,659
probably pinning so there is no

718
00:28:09,659 --> 00:28:11,580
decryption capability so you need to

719
00:28:11,580 --> 00:28:14,100
look at the the Telemetry and then we

720
00:28:14,100 --> 00:28:16,020
start to also see of course the infected

721
00:28:16,020 --> 00:28:18,720
result or the response of that query

722
00:28:18,720 --> 00:28:22,080
back out so this is the analysis of what

723
00:28:22,080 --> 00:28:24,659
could happen on the wire and so what we

724
00:28:24,659 --> 00:28:26,520
have implemented with this type of

725
00:28:26,520 --> 00:28:28,740
detection is the hidden https detection

726
00:28:28,740 --> 00:28:31,620
so we first number of all can see that

727
00:28:31,620 --> 00:28:34,500
this is now correlated to a machine we

728
00:28:34,500 --> 00:28:36,179
give you the latest IP address of that

729
00:28:36,179 --> 00:28:37,679
machine we give you a summary of what

730
00:28:37,679 --> 00:28:39,419
was detected even an infographic of how

731
00:28:39,419 --> 00:28:42,000
it would look like but then on top you

732
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:44,279
also have the timeline you'll start to

733
00:28:44,279 --> 00:28:46,200
see where it was going to and we

734
00:28:46,200 --> 00:28:47,880
immediately have been helping you with

735
00:28:47,880 --> 00:28:50,460
the j3j3s hash

736
00:28:50,460 --> 00:28:53,700
known to you the hashes yes I guess so

737
00:28:53,700 --> 00:28:57,299
so quite unique if it is unique very

738
00:28:57,299 --> 00:28:59,700
important to look into if it is a common

739
00:28:59,700 --> 00:29:02,039
j3 fingerprint then you probably have a

740
00:29:02,039 --> 00:29:04,020
regular browser and then we have looked

741
00:29:04,020 --> 00:29:05,880
at the behavior of the tunnel and now we

742
00:29:05,880 --> 00:29:08,039
can say this is multiple short TCP

743
00:29:08,039 --> 00:29:11,039
sessions abnormal Beacon so now you have

744
00:29:11,039 --> 00:29:13,140
all of that information at hand at once

745
00:29:13,140 --> 00:29:16,020
to give a quick analysis you can search

746
00:29:16,020 --> 00:29:18,539
this in your databases and now you can

747
00:29:18,539 --> 00:29:20,580
start to look on additional detections

748
00:29:20,580 --> 00:29:22,380
that come with that machine in order to

749
00:29:22,380 --> 00:29:25,320
validate it right and then on top we

750
00:29:25,320 --> 00:29:26,880
also have the investigating Cognito

751
00:29:26,880 --> 00:29:29,700
recoil capability that means recall is

752
00:29:29,700 --> 00:29:31,919
just a data Lake where all that metadata

753
00:29:31,919 --> 00:29:34,140
is stored now you can go apply your

754
00:29:34,140 --> 00:29:36,840
leucine queries and have results on

755
00:29:36,840 --> 00:29:38,640
everything you want to know because a

756
00:29:38,640 --> 00:29:40,679
fingerprint of every connection is there

757
00:29:40,679 --> 00:29:44,640
regular connect like you know I session

758
00:29:44,640 --> 00:29:46,740
we call that is there for every single

759
00:29:46,740 --> 00:29:49,440
port and then for about up to 15 16

760
00:29:49,440 --> 00:29:53,039
different metadata flows going like ldap

761
00:29:53,039 --> 00:29:57,720
being SSL x509 DNS all of these we have

762
00:29:57,720 --> 00:29:59,940
additional sometimes up to about 100

763
00:29:59,940 --> 00:30:01,980
attributes that are being collected and

764
00:30:01,980 --> 00:30:04,200
available in that data feed so that is

765
00:30:04,200 --> 00:30:06,539
where you can then start to look for

766
00:30:06,539 --> 00:30:09,539
additional information

767
00:30:09,539 --> 00:30:12,419
another component where we have spent a

768
00:30:12,419 --> 00:30:14,340
significant amount of time in the

769
00:30:14,340 --> 00:30:17,580
research department is on what is it

770
00:30:17,580 --> 00:30:20,039
that makes for instance the detection of

771
00:30:20,039 --> 00:30:23,220
privilege abuse so different

772
00:30:23,220 --> 00:30:26,399
so the tunnel is one that's one part of

773
00:30:26,399 --> 00:30:28,320
your tachyal chain then you have your

774
00:30:28,320 --> 00:30:30,720
reconnaissance very simple typically to

775
00:30:30,720 --> 00:30:33,360
find with the port scans the sweeps and

776
00:30:33,360 --> 00:30:35,700
all of these The Brute Forces there you

777
00:30:35,700 --> 00:30:37,260
don't need really a lot of logic of

778
00:30:37,260 --> 00:30:39,659
course that's being covered but that's

779
00:30:39,659 --> 00:30:41,640
not where you can make a difference but

780
00:30:41,640 --> 00:30:44,100
then when you can find that credentials

781
00:30:44,100 --> 00:30:46,740
you found the right machine you applied

782
00:30:46,740 --> 00:30:48,120
memory cards and you could read the

783
00:30:48,120 --> 00:30:50,640
memory and you found your credential and

784
00:30:50,640 --> 00:30:52,020
it turns out to be an administrative

785
00:30:52,020 --> 00:30:54,240
credential you've been able to validate

786
00:30:54,240 --> 00:30:55,980
that with your ldap queries that that

787
00:30:55,980 --> 00:30:58,679
credential indeed does have permissions

788
00:30:58,679 --> 00:31:00,659
because it's part of this and this and

789
00:31:00,659 --> 00:31:02,760
this group and you have found the

790
00:31:02,760 --> 00:31:04,620
machine that probably is very

791
00:31:04,620 --> 00:31:06,720
interesting with that privilege and now

792
00:31:06,720 --> 00:31:08,700
you would like to start using that

793
00:31:08,700 --> 00:31:11,399
and when you would use that there is no

794
00:31:11,399 --> 00:31:13,399
IAM or whatever

795
00:31:13,399 --> 00:31:15,659
privileged detection capability that is

796
00:31:15,659 --> 00:31:18,120
going to say hey suspicious because the

797
00:31:18,120 --> 00:31:20,159
credential credential is real

798
00:31:20,159 --> 00:31:22,500
it is known in that environment and has

799
00:31:22,500 --> 00:31:25,320
been used internally right and that is

800
00:31:25,320 --> 00:31:28,020
the problem of time a privileged access

801
00:31:28,020 --> 00:31:31,260
management you typically give the

802
00:31:31,260 --> 00:31:32,220
biggest

803
00:31:32,220 --> 00:31:35,220
uh privilege to a user

804
00:31:35,220 --> 00:31:38,340
and based on his role but technically he

805
00:31:38,340 --> 00:31:39,840
probably maybe only use that once or

806
00:31:39,840 --> 00:31:40,980
twice a year

807
00:31:40,980 --> 00:31:43,320
so that's one thing you can work on

808
00:31:43,320 --> 00:31:45,299
reduce the privilege you give and have

809
00:31:45,299 --> 00:31:49,679
your ex exceptions to use but this is

810
00:31:49,679 --> 00:31:51,000
also of course where the attacker is

811
00:31:51,000 --> 00:31:53,100
going after finding that privilege so we

812
00:31:53,100 --> 00:31:55,740
will look at observed privilege so we

813
00:31:55,740 --> 00:31:57,240
will because we see all the connections

814
00:31:57,240 --> 00:32:00,600
we'll start to map and learn what are

815
00:32:00,600 --> 00:32:03,360
the different accounts what are the

816
00:32:03,360 --> 00:32:05,760
different services and machines and what

817
00:32:05,760 --> 00:32:07,740
is the interaction with these

818
00:32:07,740 --> 00:32:10,320
and the combination of those that is

819
00:32:10,320 --> 00:32:12,059
happening all the time

820
00:32:12,059 --> 00:32:14,640
is probably not dangerous at all at all

821
00:32:14,640 --> 00:32:17,039
because a lot of people a lot of

822
00:32:17,039 --> 00:32:20,220
destinations right with the same so this

823
00:32:20,220 --> 00:32:22,500
is probably file sharing internally

824
00:32:22,500 --> 00:32:24,240
if it then starts to become a little bit

825
00:32:24,240 --> 00:32:26,880
more unique by for instance just one

826
00:32:26,880 --> 00:32:30,000
user or one service to only a few

827
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:32,880
destinations the the fewer connections

828
00:32:32,880 --> 00:32:36,000
the fewer combinations most likely the

829
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:38,880
higher the privilege and this is what we

830
00:32:38,880 --> 00:32:41,220
call observed privilege and with

831
00:32:41,220 --> 00:32:43,440
observed privilege we can now work

832
00:32:43,440 --> 00:32:45,840
towards building again with the data

833
00:32:45,840 --> 00:32:47,279
science clusters

834
00:32:47,279 --> 00:32:51,840
clusters of devices and or users that

835
00:32:51,840 --> 00:32:53,760
behave similarly

836
00:32:53,760 --> 00:32:54,899
right

837
00:32:54,899 --> 00:32:57,059
and once we then have that and we have

838
00:32:57,059 --> 00:32:58,620
been continuously monitoring that over

839
00:32:58,620 --> 00:32:59,760
time

840
00:32:59,760 --> 00:33:02,279
it is going to be possible to see that

841
00:33:02,279 --> 00:33:06,059
guy or girl or service or whatever

842
00:33:06,059 --> 00:33:08,279
that suddenly is coming out of the

843
00:33:08,279 --> 00:33:09,419
cluster

844
00:33:09,419 --> 00:33:11,580
and is moving into another one

845
00:33:11,580 --> 00:33:13,980
that should not happen it could be right

846
00:33:13,980 --> 00:33:15,659
it's not because this happens that there

847
00:33:15,659 --> 00:33:18,779
is an attack it could be clearly an

848
00:33:18,779 --> 00:33:20,039
appropriate use

849
00:33:20,039 --> 00:33:22,620
it could be abused internally right

850
00:33:22,620 --> 00:33:25,019
without a real attack but it also could

851
00:33:25,019 --> 00:33:27,539
be an indicator to an attack so if you

852
00:33:27,539 --> 00:33:30,059
would just focus only on this you might

853
00:33:30,059 --> 00:33:31,500
have a lot of work again

854
00:33:31,500 --> 00:33:33,299
but if you start to see this one in

855
00:33:33,299 --> 00:33:35,700
combination with other phases of the

856
00:33:35,700 --> 00:33:38,039
attack it starts to make much more sense

857
00:33:38,039 --> 00:33:41,159
and that again is why we work on things

858
00:33:41,159 --> 00:33:45,240
like unusual service from host so yes

859
00:33:45,240 --> 00:33:46,620
it's unusual

860
00:33:46,620 --> 00:33:49,159
we are not saying it is

861
00:33:49,159 --> 00:33:52,380
dangerous combination because again it

862
00:33:52,380 --> 00:33:54,480
could be an outlier it could be used but

863
00:33:54,480 --> 00:33:56,279
now you know what to look for it's the

864
00:33:56,279 --> 00:33:58,500
service from that host which seems to be

865
00:33:58,500 --> 00:34:01,080
odd but it also could be all three right

866
00:34:01,080 --> 00:34:04,380
unusual host or unusual Trio that the

867
00:34:04,380 --> 00:34:06,779
complete combination of machine service

868
00:34:06,779 --> 00:34:08,540
and account

869
00:34:08,540 --> 00:34:12,000
are quite weird and this for instance is

870
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:13,199
something we have seen with our

871
00:34:13,199 --> 00:34:16,500
customers that were had the technology

872
00:34:16,500 --> 00:34:19,080
deployed when the solar wind supply

873
00:34:19,080 --> 00:34:22,199
chain attack came in right you know what

874
00:34:22,199 --> 00:34:23,399
what happened there I'm not going to

875
00:34:23,399 --> 00:34:25,199
explain that again and so it came in

876
00:34:25,199 --> 00:34:27,540
with an update

877
00:34:27,540 --> 00:34:29,099
but of course what happened is the back

878
00:34:29,099 --> 00:34:31,500
door was there and the back door allowed

879
00:34:31,500 --> 00:34:33,179
access if used and it was not because

880
00:34:33,179 --> 00:34:34,619
the back door was established that you

881
00:34:34,619 --> 00:34:36,300
were hacked but if the attacker was

882
00:34:36,300 --> 00:34:38,520
using it it came on that machine and

883
00:34:38,520 --> 00:34:40,440
then he could probably find an account

884
00:34:40,440 --> 00:34:42,060
more quickly there

885
00:34:42,060 --> 00:34:43,859
and if then that account the service

886
00:34:43,859 --> 00:34:46,080
account on Orion was being used on a

887
00:34:46,080 --> 00:34:47,940
different machine that was exactly what

888
00:34:47,940 --> 00:34:49,859
we started to see in our technology that

889
00:34:49,859 --> 00:34:52,080
service was never actually used outside

890
00:34:52,080 --> 00:34:53,639
of that context

891
00:34:53,639 --> 00:34:56,280
and then we saw it Pam was not saying

892
00:34:56,280 --> 00:34:57,599
anything because that service had the

893
00:34:57,599 --> 00:34:59,700
rights and that's the difference between

894
00:34:59,700 --> 00:35:01,740
the privileged access and The observed

895
00:35:01,740 --> 00:35:05,520
privilege so with these and on top we

896
00:35:05,520 --> 00:35:07,560
have same developments on the cloud with

897
00:35:07,560 --> 00:35:10,020
the Azure ad privileges that we monitor

898
00:35:10,020 --> 00:35:12,960
we have a complete coverage of accounts

899
00:35:12,960 --> 00:35:16,320
internally accounts in SARS and accounts

900
00:35:16,320 --> 00:35:19,200
in Azure ad for instance

901
00:35:19,200 --> 00:35:21,720
and so when we would have a detection

902
00:35:21,720 --> 00:35:25,140
again very similar now you see a view

903
00:35:25,140 --> 00:35:27,240
where not the machine is being used but

904
00:35:27,240 --> 00:35:29,700
an account again we have the same type

905
00:35:29,700 --> 00:35:32,220
of information which again have the same

906
00:35:32,220 --> 00:35:34,320
timeline but in this case because it's

907
00:35:34,320 --> 00:35:36,540
an unusual you see here the triangle

908
00:35:36,540 --> 00:35:39,720
with the account name the machine and

909
00:35:39,720 --> 00:35:41,880
the service but we also on top tell you

910
00:35:41,880 --> 00:35:43,619
it's unusual for that service actually

911
00:35:43,619 --> 00:35:46,320
or for that account to have and that

912
00:35:46,320 --> 00:35:48,480
machine to have the service listed right

913
00:35:48,480 --> 00:35:51,200
and it's unusual for the host to have

914
00:35:51,200 --> 00:35:53,520
access to that service

915
00:35:53,520 --> 00:35:55,380
so that is what we do and we tell you on

916
00:35:55,380 --> 00:35:58,020
top what we learned over time is that it

917
00:35:58,020 --> 00:36:00,240
actually should be like this

918
00:36:00,240 --> 00:36:02,700
again this is an indicator this is

919
00:36:02,700 --> 00:36:05,640
information that is being fed into the

920
00:36:05,640 --> 00:36:07,440
different models by the different

921
00:36:07,440 --> 00:36:09,119
detections coming along on the same

922
00:36:09,119 --> 00:36:11,460
machine or account now the analyst can

923
00:36:11,460 --> 00:36:14,099
take a much more powerful decision on

924
00:36:14,099 --> 00:36:16,680
what to do next so we have the Baseline

925
00:36:16,680 --> 00:36:20,099
we have the indicators and from here we

926
00:36:20,099 --> 00:36:21,420
can work

927
00:36:21,420 --> 00:36:24,780
so we hope that this is giving you an

928
00:36:24,780 --> 00:36:26,780
idea about the data science

929
00:36:26,780 --> 00:36:29,099
and about the wrap up

930
00:36:29,099 --> 00:36:31,079
and as I said there's maybe one little

931
00:36:31,079 --> 00:36:33,359
thing maybe two

932
00:36:33,359 --> 00:36:34,980
one more thing is

933
00:36:34,980 --> 00:36:38,339
what we often see is that the

934
00:36:38,339 --> 00:36:41,160
validations and I'm not looking at you

935
00:36:41,160 --> 00:36:44,040
I'm sure you do better but a lot of our

936
00:36:44,040 --> 00:36:47,160
customers are not validating there's

937
00:36:47,160 --> 00:36:51,000
defense with the right tests

938
00:36:51,000 --> 00:36:53,099
the simplest I can explain that is like

939
00:36:53,099 --> 00:36:56,220
if you buy a bulletproof vest that you

940
00:36:56,220 --> 00:36:58,800
wear there's probably going to be robust

941
00:36:58,800 --> 00:37:00,839
against a bullet coming from a handgun

942
00:37:00,839 --> 00:37:03,599
right and if that is what you would like

943
00:37:03,599 --> 00:37:06,240
to protect again then it's probably yeah

944
00:37:06,240 --> 00:37:07,560
not a lot

945
00:37:07,560 --> 00:37:10,079
but that is also often what we now see

946
00:37:10,079 --> 00:37:12,420
that it's perceived to be the full

947
00:37:12,420 --> 00:37:14,160
defense line and they test it only with

948
00:37:14,160 --> 00:37:16,440
the bullet but the attack the APT is not

949
00:37:16,440 --> 00:37:17,520
coming in with the bullet it's a

950
00:37:17,520 --> 00:37:19,380
Precision weapon and it just goes

951
00:37:19,380 --> 00:37:21,240
through it so you need to test your

952
00:37:21,240 --> 00:37:24,300
capabilities as well and there's not

953
00:37:24,300 --> 00:37:26,160
going to lecture here I just want to let

954
00:37:26,160 --> 00:37:28,140
you know what we always talk about to

955
00:37:28,140 --> 00:37:30,680
our customers if you want to test it

956
00:37:30,680 --> 00:37:34,140
also replicate the C2 and just don't

957
00:37:34,140 --> 00:37:37,140
replicate the beacon use the C2 because

958
00:37:37,140 --> 00:37:39,780
that is really what the attacker also

959
00:37:39,780 --> 00:37:42,300
will have to do we often see that tests

960
00:37:42,300 --> 00:37:44,400
pen tests that are done they create a

961
00:37:44,400 --> 00:37:45,960
lot of beacons but they're not using the

962
00:37:45,960 --> 00:37:48,720
beacon so the idea is you should find a

963
00:37:48,720 --> 00:37:50,880
beacon but if you work on Behavior

964
00:37:50,880 --> 00:37:52,920
capabilities you're not going to look

965
00:37:52,920 --> 00:37:54,780
for the initial Beacon you're going to

966
00:37:54,780 --> 00:37:57,180
use for you look for the abuse of a

967
00:37:57,180 --> 00:37:59,040
beacon to be used as a command and

968
00:37:59,040 --> 00:38:01,680
control so that's one way and then the

969
00:38:01,680 --> 00:38:04,140
internal really do the port scans but

970
00:38:04,140 --> 00:38:07,560
also go into more than that do the RPC

971
00:38:07,560 --> 00:38:10,079
the Elder pre-cons and on top of that if

972
00:38:10,079 --> 00:38:12,180
you're going to do an exfiltration not

973
00:38:12,180 --> 00:38:14,099
just one file you typically would like

974
00:38:14,099 --> 00:38:16,800
to find multiple files internally bring

975
00:38:16,800 --> 00:38:18,960
them back to the machine that is on the

976
00:38:18,960 --> 00:38:21,420
C2 which is going to typically the port

977
00:38:21,420 --> 00:38:24,300
going out so make it as realistic as

978
00:38:24,300 --> 00:38:25,859
possible that's the advice that we give

979
00:38:25,859 --> 00:38:28,200
to our customers because this is the way

980
00:38:28,200 --> 00:38:32,099
you need to test also such capabilities

981
00:38:32,099 --> 00:38:33,480
and then

982
00:38:33,480 --> 00:38:35,460
you're now going to maybe smile with me

983
00:38:35,460 --> 00:38:37,680
it's like he's been talking about 30

984
00:38:37,680 --> 00:38:40,680
about 30 minutes about Ai and how and

985
00:38:40,680 --> 00:38:42,780
what you need to do to reduce the number

986
00:38:42,780 --> 00:38:45,300
of alerts and and to make sure that the

987
00:38:45,300 --> 00:38:48,240
analysts can take a well uh taught

988
00:38:48,240 --> 00:38:51,420
decision after 10 years but because of

989
00:38:51,420 --> 00:38:53,700
the pressure of all of our big accounts

990
00:38:53,700 --> 00:38:57,240
we are also going to address the IDS use

991
00:38:57,240 --> 00:38:58,200
cases

992
00:38:58,200 --> 00:39:00,599
with the ideas use cases I typically

993
00:39:00,599 --> 00:39:03,060
call out the snorts and the surikatas of

994
00:39:03,060 --> 00:39:05,940
this world right a lot of our bigger

995
00:39:05,940 --> 00:39:07,500
customers especially bigger customers

996
00:39:07,500 --> 00:39:09,599
still do use them and still don't want

997
00:39:09,599 --> 00:39:11,940
to let go on them they have the AI now

998
00:39:11,940 --> 00:39:14,579
but their Prime believe is still that

999
00:39:14,579 --> 00:39:16,140
they have to exchange information

1000
00:39:16,140 --> 00:39:18,960
between their between different

1001
00:39:18,960 --> 00:39:21,359
divisions and maybe also their partners

1002
00:39:21,359 --> 00:39:24,060
and so we have now looked into it and

1003
00:39:24,060 --> 00:39:26,640
identified about four use cases you

1004
00:39:26,640 --> 00:39:27,780
don't need to read it all I'm just

1005
00:39:27,780 --> 00:39:29,760
quickly saying and the c-search use

1006
00:39:29,760 --> 00:39:32,160
cases where there is also the compliance

1007
00:39:32,160 --> 00:39:34,140
requirement we have relations with

1008
00:39:34,140 --> 00:39:36,000
vendors and other customers and we need

1009
00:39:36,000 --> 00:39:38,880
to be able to quickly scan for cves and

1010
00:39:38,880 --> 00:39:41,520
we have the the obligation to do so

1011
00:39:41,520 --> 00:39:43,500
without but you cannot do that with

1012
00:39:43,500 --> 00:39:45,119
Vector because that's not what the goal

1013
00:39:45,119 --> 00:39:47,040
is of an AI right but you might have

1014
00:39:47,040 --> 00:39:49,079
that compliance use case so why not

1015
00:39:49,079 --> 00:39:51,900
bring that back into one solution the

1016
00:39:51,900 --> 00:39:53,339
same for the threat hunting maybe you

1017
00:39:53,339 --> 00:39:54,960
get indeed that intelligence of a new

1018
00:39:54,960 --> 00:39:57,240
thread you want to look for it or you

1019
00:39:57,240 --> 00:39:59,220
want to extend coverage a lot of the

1020
00:39:59,220 --> 00:40:01,140
times there is some signature coverage

1021
00:40:01,140 --> 00:40:03,839
on the firewall parameter being that

1022
00:40:03,839 --> 00:40:05,880
either between the different divisions

1023
00:40:05,880 --> 00:40:08,579
or on the parameter or you would like to

1024
00:40:08,579 --> 00:40:10,020
have a second opinion maybe you won't

1025
00:40:10,020 --> 00:40:13,160
have a a second or even maybe a third

1026
00:40:13,160 --> 00:40:15,839
capability that is going to look for

1027
00:40:15,839 --> 00:40:18,720
that information and so what are we

1028
00:40:18,720 --> 00:40:22,260
doing in this quarter actually is within

1029
00:40:22,260 --> 00:40:25,400
our sensors which are really

1030
00:40:25,400 --> 00:40:27,540
processing all the data and the

1031
00:40:27,540 --> 00:40:29,099
intelligence happens in the brain I'm

1032
00:40:29,099 --> 00:40:30,720
not going to spend too much time on that

1033
00:40:30,720 --> 00:40:33,900
right now but the sensor is picking in

1034
00:40:33,900 --> 00:40:35,579
or taking in all that data as I

1035
00:40:35,579 --> 00:40:37,440
explained earlier is creating metadata

1036
00:40:37,440 --> 00:40:40,320
from that and that metadata is then sent

1037
00:40:40,320 --> 00:40:41,460
centrally

1038
00:40:41,460 --> 00:40:43,980
we have now carved out dedicated

1039
00:40:43,980 --> 00:40:48,240
resources on those machines threads that

1040
00:40:48,240 --> 00:40:50,099
will not impact the original capability

1041
00:40:50,099 --> 00:40:53,460
and will be reserved to surikata so if

1042
00:40:53,460 --> 00:40:56,520
you have your ET open Pro or Ed Pro open

1043
00:40:56,520 --> 00:40:59,780
or you Pro or your custom rules files

1044
00:40:59,780 --> 00:41:04,680
yes I started uh 20 minutes late so I'm

1045
00:41:04,680 --> 00:41:08,339
finishing indeed you can now use these

1046
00:41:08,339 --> 00:41:12,240
to go into the platform and apply all of

1047
00:41:12,240 --> 00:41:15,660
that at once so it's a reduction and a

1048
00:41:15,660 --> 00:41:18,720
consolidation of capabilities

1049
00:41:18,720 --> 00:41:21,420
and then the last slide here

1050
00:41:21,420 --> 00:41:24,240
we do have also the opportunity for you

1051
00:41:24,240 --> 00:41:26,700
to experience what is that tool we use

1052
00:41:26,700 --> 00:41:28,920
what is that detect interface what is

1053
00:41:28,920 --> 00:41:30,660
that data Lake and how can you use

1054
00:41:30,660 --> 00:41:33,960
Lucent queries Etc so at 4 which is uh

1055
00:41:33,960 --> 00:41:36,480
not too far away now we'll have actually

1056
00:41:36,480 --> 00:41:38,099
a blue team Capture the Flag exercise

1057
00:41:38,099 --> 00:41:40,560
the boardroom it will take you about one

1058
00:41:40,560 --> 00:41:42,720
and a half hours you'll be able to use

1059
00:41:42,720 --> 00:41:45,720
your laptops to log in and then we have

1060
00:41:45,720 --> 00:41:49,020
of course a price for the winner so be

1061
00:41:49,020 --> 00:41:51,960
welcome in a little over half an hour

1062
00:41:51,960 --> 00:41:55,980
thank you and uh yeah we look forward to

1063
00:41:55,980 --> 00:41:58,400
talk to you soon

1064
00:41:58,400 --> 00:42:01,579
thank you
