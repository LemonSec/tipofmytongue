and did drone shots every day and I

37

00:08:18,840 --> 00:08:20,520
want to do a poll

um there's like talks that people want

94
00:08:22,500 --> 00:08:25,319
to have a smaller stage now so who wants

95
00:08:25,319 --> 00:08:28,080
to like let's divide the room once you

96
00:08:28,080 --> 00:08:30,379
have a bigger stage raise your hand

97
00:08:30,379 --> 00:08:33,120
we'll also have a smaller stage

98
00:08:33,120 --> 00:08:36,320
okay there's like

99
00:08:36,320 --> 00:08:40,399
well that's that's

100
00:08:41,580 --> 00:08:42,719
too long

101
00:08:42,719 --> 00:08:45,020
traffic

102
00:08:45,680 --> 00:08:48,480
I love the way you think so for the

103
00:08:48,480 --> 00:08:51,300

those who want to bigger stage and

105
00:08:52,680 --> 00:08:54,180

00:08:54,180 --> 00:08:56,220
smaller stage thank you very much very

107
00:08:56,220 --> 00:08:58,019
much or maybe do have a large stage and

108
00:08:58,019 --> 00:09:01,860
have to camp on this stage anyway

109
00:09:01,860 --> 00:09:06,060
uh so statistics we had 32 20 tickets

110

00:09:28,800 --> 00:09:30,300
whatever

117
00:09:30,300 --> 00:09:30,959
um

118
00:09:30,959 --> 00:09:33,240
so that's a lot

119
00:09:33,240 --> 00:09:35,459
um are there any Loose Ends yes of

120
00:09:35,459 --> 00:09:37,860
course uh it's a large organization it's

121
00:09:37,860 --> 00:09:39,839
a large Festival there's always Loose

122
00:09:39,839 --> 00:09:41,040
Ends

123
00:09:41,040 --> 00:09:43,860
um okay was uh had some issues with

124
00:09:43,860 --> 00:09:47,420
delivering the power supplies uh in uh

125
00:09:47,420 --> 00:09:50,220
before the event so that caused some

126
00:09:50,220 --> 00:09:52,380
burnout uh

127
00:09:52,380 --> 00:09:55,620
in The Power Team and we still have to

128
00:09:55,620 --> 00:09:57,660
talk to them and how they will fix this

129
00:09:57,660 --> 00:09:59,820
they're a very nice and decent company

130
00:09:59,820 --> 00:10:02,399
so that will will be fine if we go to

131
00:10:02,399 --> 00:10:05,519
them next time but there will yeah we

132
00:10:05,519 --> 00:10:07,440
have to prevent that this will happen

133
00:10:07,440 --> 00:10:09,899
again so and they are aware of what they

134
00:10:09,899 --> 00:10:12,180
did so there's no friction there it's

135
00:10:12,180 --> 00:10:14,160
just a loose end there's nothing really

136
00:10:14,160 --> 00:10:15,839
weird

137
00:10:15,839 --> 00:10:19,940
um they're they they they feel shame so

138
00:10:19,940 --> 00:10:23,519
scouting landhood we rented the London

139
00:10:23,519 --> 00:10:27,300
scouting and

140
00:10:27,800 --> 00:10:31,560
uh in the end we got less like less

141
00:10:31,560 --> 00:10:34,140
Fields than we ordered so and it was a

142
00:10:34,140 --> 00:10:36,360
lot of it costs a lot of we had to

143
00:10:36,360 --> 00:10:38,880
shuffle things around and people uh

144
00:10:38,880 --> 00:10:40,980
doing extra work scouting also doing

145
00:10:40,980 --> 00:10:43,019
extra work they should

146
00:10:43,019 --> 00:10:47,160
um and uh what we did is uh calculated

147
00:10:47,160 --> 00:10:50,120
the square square meters

148
00:10:50,120 --> 00:10:52,760
subtracted The Meters that we didn't get

149
00:10:52,760 --> 00:10:55,440
and we withheld that from the payment to

150
00:10:55,440 --> 00:10:59,160
scouting so because you know they they

151
00:10:59,160 --> 00:11:01,620
insist on paying them in full but I

152
00:11:01,620 --> 00:11:04,019
don't think so so uh that's that's a

153
00:11:04,019 --> 00:11:05,640
loose end there

154
00:11:05,640 --> 00:11:07,920
um they they also we also did not have

155
00:11:07,920 --> 00:11:10,079
an evaluation yet so they want to pay in

156
00:11:10,079 --> 00:11:12,000
full before the evaluation that's not

157
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:14,519
going to happen so maybe they also have

158
00:11:14,519 --> 00:11:16,079
issues right maybe they also have

159
00:11:16,079 --> 00:11:18,720
damages that we don't know of so that

160
00:11:18,720 --> 00:11:20,579
was a strange

161
00:11:20,579 --> 00:11:23,220
um so uh there will be every evaluation

162
00:11:23,220 --> 00:11:25,040
on this

163
00:11:25,040 --> 00:11:27,420
there's a water vendor that we always

164
00:11:27,420 --> 00:11:30,240
used uh on this terrain or that scouting

165
00:11:30,240 --> 00:11:32,100
always use that did not deliver instead

166
00:11:32,100 --> 00:11:34,500
we had many Camp Zone helpers

167
00:11:34,500 --> 00:11:38,700
MCH yeah exactly

168
00:11:39,600 --> 00:11:42,600
so uh yeah and if it's attack Zone this

169
00:11:42,600 --> 00:11:43,860
summer

170
00:11:43,860 --> 00:11:45,839
um plug Shameless plug

171
00:11:45,839 --> 00:11:49,440
um and they uh they fixed a lot of of

172
00:11:49,440 --> 00:11:53,120
 for this um yeah like like

173
00:11:53,120 --> 00:11:56,940
ridiculous so uh you cannot thank them

174
00:11:56,940 --> 00:12:00,180
enough and we have to look out for a

175
00:12:00,180 --> 00:12:03,060
water fan or next time because that's

176
00:12:03,060 --> 00:12:05,160
something you cannot you cannot do wrong

177
00:12:05,160 --> 00:12:07,320
otherwise you will not have an event or

178
00:12:07,320 --> 00:12:09,839
uh and we will close the financial year

179
00:12:09,839 --> 00:12:11,880
which is just boring and basic and that

180
00:12:11,880 --> 00:12:14,279
will happen somewhere next year uh so we

181
00:12:14,279 --> 00:12:16,260
are somewhere this year

182
00:12:16,260 --> 00:12:17,100
um

183
00:12:17,100 --> 00:12:20,040
uh episode picture by uh kiss from the

184
00:12:20,040 --> 00:12:22,260
DVD

185
00:12:22,260 --> 00:12:25,680
um how are the finances

186
00:12:25,680 --> 00:12:26,940
um

187
00:12:26,940 --> 00:12:29,760
we've got over a thousand startup

188
00:12:29,760 --> 00:12:33,300
donations that made it possible to start

189
00:12:33,300 --> 00:12:36,000
organizing the event at all because of

190
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:38,220
all the weird constraints with kofits

191
00:12:38,220 --> 00:12:40,800
and down payments and increase and

192
00:12:40,800 --> 00:12:43,380
increase now you have to pay full in

193
00:12:43,380 --> 00:12:45,779
advance instead of like uh way way way

194
00:12:45,779 --> 00:12:48,660
late because it will be fine the entire

195
00:12:48,660 --> 00:12:50,760
sector changed the entire event sector

196
00:12:50,760 --> 00:12:53,399
changed in the in the years during covet

197
00:12:53,399 --> 00:12:55,620
and yeah of course it's it's fully

198
00:12:55,620 --> 00:12:58,380
understandable so we had to pay a lot of

199
00:12:58,380 --> 00:13:00,839
money in order to get started which was

200
00:13:00,839 --> 00:13:03,779
a lot lower in the in the Shia event uh

201
00:13:03,779 --> 00:13:05,279
there's a one and a half million euro

202
00:13:05,279 --> 00:13:08,279
turnover around which is an insane

203
00:13:08,279 --> 00:13:11,279
amount it's it's just ridiculous

204
00:13:11,279 --> 00:13:11,880
um

205
00:13:11,880 --> 00:13:13,800
this is the bank account

206
00:13:13,800 --> 00:13:16,380
how it looks how much money we have on

207
00:13:16,380 --> 00:13:19,079
it and you see that yeah here's like the

208
00:13:19,079 --> 00:13:21,959
here do we start and I don't know here

209
00:13:21,959 --> 00:13:23,880
here do we start I don't know how this

210
00:13:23,880 --> 00:13:26,459
got changed so probably

211
00:13:26,459 --> 00:13:28,500
did something aesthetically correct and

212
00:13:28,500 --> 00:13:30,480
then I forgot the error let it start

213
00:13:30,480 --> 00:13:32,279
here it's a flat line and then here the

214
00:13:32,279 --> 00:13:35,639
you get the uh the bar and turn over and

215
00:13:35,639 --> 00:13:39,360
search and uh the sales from all the uh

216
00:13:39,360 --> 00:13:42,360
vendors that search for the food vendors

217
00:13:42,360 --> 00:13:44,100
um and then you slowly see something

218
00:13:44,100 --> 00:13:46,040
very scary

219
00:13:46,040 --> 00:13:48,839
you see like we're paying taxes and such

220
00:13:48,839 --> 00:13:50,779
and uh

221
00:13:50,779 --> 00:13:54,420
at one point uh they uh we were the

222
00:13:54,420 --> 00:13:56,279
accountant was basically like uh putting

223
00:13:56,279 --> 00:13:59,060
all these invoices into the system and

224
00:13:59,060 --> 00:14:02,399
we got this letter like they then if you

225
00:14:02,399 --> 00:14:03,660
don't

226
00:14:03,660 --> 00:14:06,360
uh hand in the the numbers that you

227
00:14:06,360 --> 00:14:08,459
actually run so we do one a lot of

228
00:14:08,459 --> 00:14:10,440
turnover in a quarter and then the next

229
00:14:10,440 --> 00:14:12,660
we don't do anything again but if you

230
00:14:12,660 --> 00:14:14,339
don't say that you don't and do anything

231
00:14:14,339 --> 00:14:16,320
again they assume you do the same as

232
00:14:16,320 --> 00:14:18,560
before

233
00:14:18,600 --> 00:14:21,600
that sucks a little bit uh if you are a

234
00:14:21,600 --> 00:14:23,639
self-employed person you know these

235
00:14:23,639 --> 00:14:27,480
letters probably and they are like a lot

236
00:14:27,480 --> 00:14:31,980
of bark but no bite if you are not doing

237
00:14:31,980 --> 00:14:34,560
this every time

238
00:14:34,560 --> 00:14:37,019
um and that's already been corrected so

239
00:14:37,019 --> 00:14:40,560
that's good um so how are we we're

240
00:14:40,560 --> 00:14:44,100
standing now we started with about 50K

241
00:14:44,100 --> 00:14:46,139
yeah during the making of these slides

242
00:14:46,139 --> 00:14:48,899
we found that we were 11 cents short of

243
00:14:48,899 --> 00:14:51,959
1337 so we donated this

244
00:14:51,959 --> 00:14:55,920
colossal amount of 11 cents uh if you uh

245
00:14:55,920 --> 00:14:57,720
in the Netherlands you have to pay vat

246
00:14:57,720 --> 00:14:59,940
we did and

247
00:14:59,940 --> 00:15:03,600
um we will get 100 and 110 000 Euros

248
00:15:03,600 --> 00:15:07,320
back from the tax Authority in v80 which

249
00:15:07,320 --> 00:15:09,300
is nice uh there will be some invoices

250
00:15:09,300 --> 00:15:11,699
that will be paid and we will end up

251
00:15:11,699 --> 00:15:17,339
with a nice 100 000 Euros so hooray

252
00:15:20,100 --> 00:15:22,320
and that is including the ridiculous

253
00:15:22,320 --> 00:15:24,360
amount of like sponsoring that we got

254
00:15:24,360 --> 00:15:26,279
this time

255
00:15:26,279 --> 00:15:29,040
um I I think I forgot that like we had

256
00:15:29,040 --> 00:15:34,260
like 200 000 Euro sponsor turnover 185

257
00:15:34,440 --> 00:15:36,920
000 like ridiculous that money just

258
00:15:36,920 --> 00:15:39,540
evaporated just because of higher prices

259
00:15:39,540 --> 00:15:41,820
and uh

260
00:15:41,820 --> 00:15:45,000
yeah it would be nicer to do something

261
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:47,339
uh cooler really but yeah it just

262
00:15:47,339 --> 00:15:49,330
evaporated so

263
00:15:49,330 --> 00:15:50,040
[Music]

264
00:15:50,040 --> 00:15:51,060
um

265
00:15:51,060 --> 00:15:54,480
so what is this uh this is run by the

266
00:15:54,480 --> 00:15:56,699
the ifcat foundation what will this do

267
00:15:56,699 --> 00:15:58,800
the coming years

268
00:15:58,800 --> 00:16:01,800
um it will support it will continue just

269
00:16:01,800 --> 00:16:04,139
to support a growing hacker community so

270
00:16:04,139 --> 00:16:07,680
if you want to start a hacker space in

271
00:16:07,680 --> 00:16:10,139
your region and you we can reimburse the

272
00:16:10,139 --> 00:16:13,199
startup costs of that you can set up a

273
00:16:13,199 --> 00:16:15,320
legal entity for this for example

274
00:16:15,320 --> 00:16:17,880
if you have a project that grows the

275
00:16:17,880 --> 00:16:19,940
hacker community in some way or another

276
00:16:19,940 --> 00:16:23,699
we might support that financially for uh

277
00:16:23,699 --> 00:16:27,660
a startup cost for example or if you

278
00:16:27,660 --> 00:16:30,320
want to have a sample of something and

279
00:16:30,320 --> 00:16:32,820
kick-start it

280
00:16:32,820 --> 00:16:35,100
um that's things that we support

281
00:16:35,100 --> 00:16:38,160
um and we hope with that to grow the

282
00:16:38,160 --> 00:16:41,160
community and have a lot of a bigger

283
00:16:41,160 --> 00:16:42,899
event in future

284
00:16:42,899 --> 00:16:43,500
um

285
00:16:43,500 --> 00:16:47,060
so if you if you're in doubt if you uh

286
00:16:47,060 --> 00:16:50,100
if you have something that is a little

287
00:16:50,100 --> 00:16:53,060
bit out of the lines just

288
00:16:53,060 --> 00:16:56,699
or me or Henry or somebody from Project

289
00:16:56,699 --> 00:17:00,120
lighting and it will end up uh with the

290
00:17:00,120 --> 00:17:02,459
right people anyway and then

291
00:17:02,459 --> 00:17:04,740
but we're going to help out so that's uh

292
00:17:04,740 --> 00:17:06,240
that's that

293
00:17:06,240 --> 00:17:07,140
um

294
00:17:07,140 --> 00:17:08,640
also

295
00:17:08,640 --> 00:17:11,179
um what will happen for the next event

296
00:17:11,179 --> 00:17:15,900
we try to regress it it works whether we

297
00:17:15,900 --> 00:17:18,240
showed it to some if if you can see a

298
00:17:18,240 --> 00:17:20,579
flow in it please

299
00:17:20,579 --> 00:17:24,540
uh chat GPT helped us with this

300
00:17:24,540 --> 00:17:29,460
so uh will 2025 happen uh 2025 should be

301
00:17:29,460 --> 00:17:31,440
the normal year where there will be uh

302
00:17:31,440 --> 00:17:34,740
their tracker Camp uh I think the gear

303
00:17:34,740 --> 00:17:36,360
itself will happen

304
00:17:36,360 --> 00:17:39,480
um and the community also yeah it looks

305
00:17:39,480 --> 00:17:41,400
very good like if it's like hacker Hotel

306
00:17:41,400 --> 00:17:44,460
really keep the engine running and make

307
00:17:44,460 --> 00:17:47,160
the scene larger and more positive and a

308
00:17:47,160 --> 00:17:51,240

335
00:19:09,900 --> 00:19:12,059
dangerous slope right before you know it

336
00:19:12,059 --> 00:19:15,000
just when I was out they pulled me back

337

in

338
00:19:16,620 --> 00:19:19,500
so if you want to be on the board of if

339
00:19:19,500 --> 00:19:23,520
God please talk to me or Henry there is

340
00:19:23,520 --> 00:19:25,620
a very non-transparent non-democratic

341
00:19:25,620 --> 00:19:29,100
way how we decide uh if if you're right

342
00:19:29,100 --> 00:19:32,400
we might approach also some people uh to

343
00:19:32,400 --> 00:19:35,580
help out uh in the board

344
00:19:35,580 --> 00:19:38,700
um and know that the board itself

345
00:19:38,700 --> 00:19:41,400
is not the one that's running the

346
00:19:41,400 --> 00:19:42,660
organization

347
00:19:42,660 --> 00:19:45,860
so uh the board is a legal vehicle

348
00:19:45,860 --> 00:19:48,299
that's easy that's to be disposed of

349
00:19:48,299 --> 00:19:51,020
basically like like Yoshi in video games

350
00:19:51,020 --> 00:19:53,700
so it's it is uh it's just a legal

351
00:19:53,700 --> 00:19:56,039
entity the event projection itself

352
00:19:56,039 --> 00:19:57,480
happened this time through project

353
00:19:57,480 --> 00:20:00,419
lighting it's a theme of what's five

354
00:20:00,419 --> 00:20:03,480
people uh and you can be on the board

355
00:20:03,480 --> 00:20:05,100
and not be in Project lighting I

356
00:20:05,100 --> 00:20:08,340
recommend to do both because you need to

357
00:20:08,340 --> 00:20:12,000
keep your feet on the ground and you you

358
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:13,740
need to get your hands dirty as well I

359
00:20:13,740 --> 00:20:17,400
don't believe in that you can do that

360
00:20:17,400 --> 00:20:19,620
from a hammock somewhere up in a tree

361
00:20:19,620 --> 00:20:21,780
and I have your people running around

362
00:20:21,780 --> 00:20:25,740
that doesn't work here so

363
00:20:25,740 --> 00:20:26,520
um

364
00:20:26,520 --> 00:20:28,799
if you would like to uh challenge

365
00:20:28,799 --> 00:20:31,980
yourself if you would like to uh look

366
00:20:31,980 --> 00:20:33,720
forward to something like this please

367
00:20:33,720 --> 00:20:36,419
talk to me or Henry afterwards

368
00:20:36,419 --> 00:20:40,919

369
00:20:40,919 --> 00:20:42,360
answer to the ultimate question about

370

Studio next to the stage

425
00:23:25,980 --> 00:23:28,620
because the radio Studio does interviews

426
00:23:28,620 --> 00:23:30,659
all day and we have like this big stage

427
