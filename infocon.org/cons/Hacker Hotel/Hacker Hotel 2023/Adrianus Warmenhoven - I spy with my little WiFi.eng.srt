the look at Sean The Dancing The

74
00:03:47,940 --> 00:03:49,560
particles Them cells The Make large

75
00:03:49,560 --> 00:03:52,860
collisions huge a Mount data en from

76
00:03:52,860 --> 00:03:54,480
that huge Mount of data They the

77
00:03:54,480 --> 00:03:57,420
jews  this particle must exist

78
00:03:57,420 --> 00:03:59,700
and this is actually what you do with Meta

79
00:03:59,700 --> 00:04:01,860
data and that is more Meta data around you

80
00:04:01,860 --> 00:04:05,180
the actually Real Eyes

81
00:04:08,220 --> 00:04:10,439
with this audience I don't think I need

00:04:10,439 --> 00:04:11,879
to Delft Too Much in all of these

83
00:04:11,879 --> 00:04:15,379
pictures but let Us

84
00:04:20,160 --> 00:04:22,880
open

85
00:04:24,500 --> 00:04:27,300
there  are they with those well what Pixie on

86
00:04:27,300 --> 00:04:29,600
the bottom is

87
00:04:29,639 --> 00:04:32,220
It is the wi-fi channels can

88
00:04:32,220 --> 00:04:34,979
stay Chance en of course on the right

89
00:04:34,979 --> 00:04:37,199
It's a bit How wifi Works too I know

90
00:04:37,199 --> 00:04:39,720
That's changes in there but for the

91
00:04:39,720 --> 00:04:42,060
Shake of the Playstation argument Just

92
00:04:42,060 --> 00:04:44,520
Leap even that

93
00:04:44,520 --> 00:04:46,740
This Is important because what I'm doing

94
00:04:46,740 --> 00:04:49,919
What I'm going to show you is we going

95
00:04:49,919 --> 00:04:52,199
to completely ignore

96
00:04:52,199 --> 00:04:54,960
The Green the light green And The Yellow

97
00:04:54,960 --> 00:04:57,060
layers

98
00:04:57,060 --> 00:04:59,040
We Don't Care About That so We Don't

99
00:04:59,040 --> 00:05:01,199
Care About doing  all the people with en

100
00:05:01,199 --> 00:05:03,540
gription and Hide and all that stuff We

101
00:05:03,540 --> 00:05:06,540
Don't Care We Just Look at the Mac and

102
00:05:06,540 --> 00:05:10,400
Alice llc uh de Visible addressing

103
00:05:17,460 --> 00:05:20,160
en de core of the Idea is if you have

104
00:05:20,160 --> 00:05:21,960
Something wireless

105
00:05:21,960 --> 00:05:27,020
it must transmith to base station

106
00:05:29,180 --> 00:05:31,400
Lot of

107
00:05:31,400 --> 00:05:34,320
transmissions going Around Us on Around

108
00:05:34,320 --> 00:05:37,979
Us All The Time and you guys really need to

109
00:05:37,979 --> 00:05:40,680
identify how expensive City in this

110
00:05:40,680 --> 00:05:43,139
and everybody can re that recipient From

111
00:05:43,139 --> 00:05:44,400
The Air

112
00:05:44,400 --> 00:05:47,580
does the base station Now that it is for

113
00:05:47,580 --> 00:05:50,780
the baystation or the Climate

114
00:05:51,600 --> 00:05:53,280
so

115
00:05:53,280 --> 00:05:55,860
wallow worth a sticking  gives

116
00:05:55,860 --> 00:06:00,240
myself eh and meet It This one of my 100

117
00:06:00,240 --> 00:06:02,100
euro challenges Every cup of Years I

118
00:06:02,100 --> 00:06:05,220
Give my self-100 challenge and That's

119
00:06:05,220 --> 00:06:07,380
These requirements need to be done

120
00:06:07,380 --> 00:06:10,139
with really available components would

121
00:06:10,139 --> 00:06:12,240
mostly going to the Media Markt should

122
00:06:12,240 --> 00:06:14,280
been of

123
00:06:14,280 --> 00:06:16,080
The software should  be mostly available

124
00:06:16,080 --> 00:06:19,620
and require minimum of self Be king

125
00:06:19,620 --> 00:06:22,080
and anybody Any Tex Sense should be

126
00:06:22,080 --> 00:06:24,419
able to replicate this and Reason

127
00:06:24,419 --> 00:06:26,759
Projects like this is because I want to

128
00:06:26,759 --> 00:06:28,620
have a feeling of What People around me

129
00:06:28,620 --> 00:06:30,919
like students

130
00:06:30,919 --> 00:06:33,860
security Would you

131
00:06:33,860 --> 00:06:37,979
be able to do what Attack Factor  landscape

132
00:06:37,979 --> 00:06:40,740
I have in my home

133
00:06:40,740 --> 00:06:42,900
so I came up

134
00:06:42,900 --> 00:06:45,600
With The Course Raspberry Pi

135
00:06:45,600 --> 00:06:48,060
or let Panda latte Panda I really like

136
00:06:48,060 --> 00:06:49,639
we can

137
00:06:49,639 --> 00:06:53,720
frosessor and Tenson form Factor

138
00:06:53,720 --> 00:06:56,340
pandas for this project that Boat Enter

139
00:06:56,340 --> 00:06:57,960
changable

140
00:06:57,960 --> 00:07:00,720
sure

141
00:07:00,720 --> 00:07:02,759
every The Little Bit because I have One

142
00:07:02,759 --> 00:07:04,699
Line Around  This is one of these Big

143
00:07:04,699 --> 00:07:07,800
battery packs ehm you can use that and a

144
00:07:07,800 --> 00:07:09,780
Raspberry Pi and Leave The Raspberry Pi

145
00:07:09,780 --> 00:07:12,000
Running for at least A Day and if you

146
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:15,120
have lots of wifi dongles It's Closer to

147
00:07:15,120 --> 00:07:18,360
eh hvd

ehm wat je kan already CN Which wifi

162
00:08:11,460 --> 00:08:13,620
dongles Which hardware is already

163
00:08:13,620 --> 00:08:16,080
compatible with you goodbye I using Just

164
00:08:16,080 --> 00:08:20,220
stock wifi dongles wat je produced Any

165
00:08:20,220 --> 00:08:22,139
of this hardware

166
00:08:22,139 --> 00:08:24,720
and You Can See It's really easy to  also

00:08:32,760 --> 00:08:35,039
it's just on the problems that you

171
00:08:35,039 --> 00:08:37,260
have if you want to spam The Hall

172
00:08:37,260 --> 00:08:39,599
Spectrum Because you have All This wi-fi

173
00:08:39,599 --> 00:08:41,880
dongles Because you don't want to Any

174
00:08:41,880 --> 00:08:43,458
Channel hoping

175
00:08:43,458 --> 00:08:46,860
if you  want to monitor one channel that

176
00:08:46,860 --> 00:08:48,019
you need to

177
00:08:48,019 --> 00:08:50,279
lock yourself unto that Channel and you

178
00:08:50,279 --> 00:08:52,800
cannot Skip to the extens on the next

179
00:08:52,800 --> 00:08:54,600
Channel to Excel to get all the Flames

180
00:08:54,600 --> 00:08:56,940
wouldn't you all the wifi dongles something

181
00:08:56,940 --> 00:09:00,959
from Locked One specific frequency

182
00:09:00,959 --> 00:09:03,899
And then Comes a big  problems The Give

183
00:09:03,899 --> 00:09:06,839
You all the package that I receive

184
00:09:06,839 --> 00:09:08,459
and this will be coming Nightmare

185
00:09:08,459 --> 00:09:10,800
Because if you do is all over USB you

186
00:09:10,800 --> 00:09:12,240
get The Lord Of traffic It's a lot of

187
00:09:12,240 --> 00:09:16,019
package on Around It is moment

188
00:09:16,019 --> 00:09:18,120
So This is wel die if you ever buildish

189
00:09:18,120 --> 00:09:19,500
this  Will Be One Of The challenges that

190
00:09:19,500 --> 00:09:22,080
you have not hardware multiple Agents

191
00:09:22,080 --> 00:09:25,019
ehm The variance strategy is how you can

192
00:09:25,019 --> 00:09:27,660
softis Problem but they you have you

193
00:09:27,660 --> 00:09:30,620
will have a lot of Wars

194
00:09:30,899 --> 00:09:35,220
and of course if you have a Remote agent

195
00:09:35,220 --> 00:09:37,880
like Raspberry Pi You put The dongle  sentence

196
00:09:37,880 --> 00:09:41,220
ehm je Put the battery on you want to

197
00:09:41,220 --> 00:09:43,019
Dick it in Somewhere Close To some

198
00:09:43,019 --> 00:09:46,080
Victims home ehm Univers And that data

199
00:09:46,080 --> 00:09:48,480
back to yourself is wel zo en Just of

200
00:09:48,480 --> 00:09:50,360
course In Your Way

201
00:09:50,360 --> 00:09:53,899
GPS modem

202
00:10:02,300 --> 00:10:05,220
process all of this data

203
00:10:05,220 --> 00:10:09,260
en we want to get all  the Metal

204
00:10:09,260 --> 00:10:12,860
and the code

205
00:10:13,100 --> 00:10:16,100
vps

206
00:10:22,399 --> 00:10:25,200
so for that we have couple of software

207
00:10:25,200 --> 00:10:28,320
choices the things I Use Wear

208
00:10:28,320 --> 00:10:30,500
Kiss with wireless

209
00:10:30,500 --> 00:10:33,300
kismat is really nice because out of the

210
00:10:33,300 --> 00:10:36,240
box it supports all of this hardware It

211
00:10:36,240 --> 00:10:38,519
does all the Packard decoding en thus

212
00:10:38,519 --> 00:10:41,220
Lord of in richment  As well she has eh

213
00:10:41,220 --> 00:10:44,459
GPS on your Raspberry piar location It

214
00:10:44,459 --> 00:10:46,260
can put that on the on the day as well

215
00:10:46,260 --> 00:10:48,839
zo kistnet is really a good Choice For

216
00:10:48,839 --> 00:10:52,519
Your Central processing system

217
00:10:53,700 --> 00:10:57,180
from Kismet all of this package Because

218
00:10:57,180 --> 00:10:58,680
you want to have a Time Serious Day

219
00:10:58,680 --> 00:11:00,660
todays  are Get Back to Why We Are Want

220
00:11:00,660 --> 00:11:03,920
To Have A Time Serious database

221
00:11:42,320 --> 00:11:45,079
if you have a

222
00:11:45,079 --> 00:11:48,060
societ but you don't have GPS coordinates

223
00:11:48,060 --> 00:11:52,079
eh Wiggle is ehm database of eh lots of

224
00:11:52,079 --> 00:11:56,940
eh wifi ssidies en de GPS gordons It's

225
00:11:56,940 --> 00:11:58,620
really fun to look Your look  up your own

226
00:11:58,620 --> 00:12:01,680
address on wiggle.net and see If You're

227
00:12:01,680 --> 00:12:04,320
On WiFi is there an How many people are

228
00:12:04,320 --> 00:12:06,720
to the Walking post That You Know How

229
00:12:06,720 --> 00:12:10,740
many War Walkers wiglers I don't know

230
00:12:10,740 --> 00:12:12,360
what the protect World How many Of Those

231
00:12:12,360 --> 00:12:14,839
People you  have

232
00:12:46,100 --> 00:12:49,100
client or An ssi Die is seems an

233
00:12:49,100 --> 00:12:52,760
apex point or client you can see the

234
00:12:52,760 --> 00:12:56,760
Activity and the incidents freekes you can

235
00:12:56,760 --> 00:12:59,820
see the frequency ehm en dat is ons is

236
00:12:59,820 --> 00:13:01,380
somada interesting for the hacker People

237
00:13:01,380 --> 00:13:04,019
for the penetration test People The Red

238
00:13:04,019 --> 00:13:07,019
Lines This Is site effect  of my project

239
00:13:07,019 --> 00:13:09,360
I'm not using it but Whenever There is

240
00:13:09,360 --> 00:13:12,019
in Kiss Me A Redline in means It has eh

241
00:13:12,019 --> 00:13:15,240
intercepted handshake Packard

242
00:13:15,240 --> 00:13:18,000
means you don't need to the out the

243
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:20,399
wi-fi force a Believe so it's not even

244
00:13:20,399 --> 00:13:22,019
noticeable So if you  have kiss me just

245
00:13:22,019 --> 00:13:24,180
Waiting round and some Point that will

246
00:13:24,180 --> 00:13:25,560
be handshake package And then you can

247
00:13:25,560 --> 00:13:27,839
start tracking The password

248
00:13:27,839 --> 00:13:30,560
dan doe so you

249
00:13:32,399 --> 00:13:35,420


250
00:13:38,420 --> 00:13:42,199


251
00:13:45,540 --> 00:13:49,160
can see about Anything Like That on the left you can see

252
00:13:52,700 --> 00:13:57,139
if your raspberry pi with all this

253
00:13:57,260 --> 00:14:00,060
source and i have budget  else Pacific

254
00:14:00,060 --> 00:14:01,500
Place I always have in a plastic Bag

255
00:14:01,500 --> 00:14:04,560
ehm and he has it specific locations

256
00:14:04,560 --> 00:14:08,519
round and data source de counter Which

257
00:14:08,519 --> 00:14:11,220
Frequencies met Just Would frequencis

258
00:14:11,220 --> 00:14:12,600
you want to look

259
00:14:12,600 --> 00:14:15,420
and basically you can Just say this data

260
00:14:15,420 --> 00:14:17,100
sources Only disreference This data

261
00:14:17,100 --> 00:14:19,279
sources Only that so  you can manage

262
00:14:19,279 --> 00:14:21,839
interference en eh the Mount of package

263
00:14:21,839 --> 00:14:24,680
you can capture

264
00:14:26,220 --> 00:14:31,279
i it really nice logging command Line

265
00:14:31,279 --> 00:14:35,360
login's well from all the things

266
00:14:37,100 --> 00:14:40,169
[Music]

267
00:14:41,240 --> 00:14:45,000
like somebody's trying to do a crack

268
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:49,740
Attack some access point eh someone ssi

269
00:14:49,740 --> 00:14:54,420
die en dat maybe see spoofing en  this

270
00:14:54,420 --> 00:14:56,160
is was just happening All Around my

271
00:14:56,160 --> 00:14:59,360
house I was in the one doing it so

272
00:14:59,360 --> 00:15:01,500
It's just things that you see if you

273
00:15:01,500 --> 00:15:03,480
have all these dongles On And if All

274
00:15:03,480 --> 00:15:06,300
This channels coming in

275
00:15:06,300 --> 00:15:08,820
Let it Still Give me a picture of what´s

276
00:15:08,820 --> 00:15:11,060
going on

277
00:15:11,880 --> 00:15:13,920
Looking At All The Clients And The

278
00:15:13,920 --> 00:15:16,320
Access Points And Gears Met Use Your

279
00:15:16,320 --> 00:15:18,680
Ready Clear Idear Where We Going It Is

280
00:15:18,680 --> 00:15:21,300
Good See The Middle One That's An Access

281
00:15:21,300 --> 00:15:24,000
Point And Art He All The Associated

282
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:25,920
Kleins Is Ever Had

283
00:15:25,920 --> 00:15:28,399
I Can See How Busy It Is What Wifi

284
00:15:28,399 --> 00:15:32,040
Frequencies Day Use What Type of data de

285
00:15:32,040 --> 00:15:34,980
use all those Kind of Things You can

286
00:15:34,980 --> 00:15:38,279
also see that uh kiss me ads Defender

287
00:15:38,279 --> 00:15:40,980
already from offenderday tobase but die

288
00:15:40,980 --> 00:15:42,959
falls de backad dresses is wel En dit is

289
00:15:42,959 --> 00:15:46,199
wel also Beer important part 4 daredevil

290
00:15:46,199 --> 00:15:51,439
like Super Power Of  Blind scene later on

291
00:15:53,639 --> 00:15:57,120
dus is actually Where The Real Friends

292
00:15:57,120 --> 00:15:59,820
Stars at least for me

293
00:15:59,820 --> 00:16:03,600
This Is database

294
00:16:04,920 --> 00:16:08,820
on the left it all the devices Points

295
00:16:08,820 --> 00:16:10,160
over Time

296
00:16:10,160 --> 00:16:13,160
storing

297
00:16:13,820 --> 00:16:18,180
but it's Just cumulative so I Didn't Do

298
00:16:18,180 --> 00:16:20,100
Anything of the processing is it and the

299
00:16:20,100 --> 00:16:21,899
Cool Thing  with Prometheus is that you

300
00:16:21,899 --> 00:16:24,660
can if you have the pulling in the data

301
00:16:24,660 --> 00:16:27,420
you can add some Formula estoid and pre

302
00:16:27,420 --> 00:16:30,420
process it so you get images Like on the

303
00:16:30,420 --> 00:16:31,800
right

304
00:16:31,800 --> 00:16:33,260
on the right is

305
00:16:33,260 --> 00:16:36,480
clients that Active and not Active je

306
00:16:36,480 --> 00:16:39,000
kan die has your unificent eh die

307
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:40,380
does Kenneth have your own a definitions for

308
00:16:40,380 --> 00:16:44,880
that and it's from Zero eh from Zero to

309
00:16:44,880 --> 00:16:50,160
120 This is like I can see It is from

310
00:16:50,160 --> 00:16:53,600
Zero to die off

311
00:16:53,699 --> 00:16:55,860
and you can see from that access point

312
00:16:55,860 --> 00:16:58,259
When People are Sleeping That's really

313
00:16:58,259 --> 00:16:59,779
really Obvious

314
00:16:59,779 --> 00:17:03,120
That's on  the left that low Line en je

315
00:17:03,120 --> 00:17:05,099
kan even Sea eh One small device

316
00:17:05,099 --> 00:17:07,500
beconing In The Middle Of The Nigel van

317
00:17:07,500 --> 00:17:10,500
data And then When People Wake up you

318
00:17:10,500 --> 00:17:12,359
can see Them realling the news then

319
00:17:12,359 --> 00:17:14,040
doing other Stuff

320
00:17:14,040 --> 00:17:17,819
you can see Active

321
00:17:20,939 --> 00:17:24,359
grafana For The Night pictures I  did not

322
00:17:24,359 --> 00:17:28,760
Manic to get Anything comparencible

323
00:17:38,419 --> 00:17:41,280
if you want a person really Bridge The

324
00:17:41,280 --> 00:17:43,559
Graphics you can really make Something

325
00:17:43,559 --> 00:17:45,600
nice other and May The Small hotspot for

326
00:17:45,600 --> 00:17:48,799
the for the Frequencies but

327
00:17:49,380 --> 00:17:51,419
SO

328
00:17:51,419 --> 00:17:55,260
en ik go back to What I can see is Let

329
00:17:55,260 --> 00:17:57,000
me just go back  to the Prometheus

330
00:17:57,000 --> 00:17:59,460
database Mitch

331
00:17:59,460 --> 00:18:01,620
if you have All This Type of Meta data

332
00:18:01,620 --> 00:18:03,539
you can see When The specific device

333
00:18:03,539 --> 00:18:06,600
connects What the disconnect you can see

334
00:18:06,600 --> 00:18:09,179
how much data itsens How many packassed

335

antennis by the tuber Something

549
00:29:31,760 --> 00:29:36,720
The Beam Kind of Works but That's Only

550
00:29:36,720 --> 00:29:38,940
for More technical People en People

551
00:29:38,940 --> 00:29:40,820
Willing to do this

552
00:29:40,820 --> 00:29:44,460
realized  this realization really strong

553
00:29:44,460 --> 00:29:45,740
that

554
00:29:45,740 --> 00:29:48,299
99% of the people are there They Don't

555
00:29:48,299 --> 00:29:50,880
Care About How This Works and and Why

556
00:29:50,880 --> 00:29:52,559
this Works that Just Want to go to the

557
00:29:52,559 --> 00:29:55,140
Media Markt by that stuff planket enter

558

Somer and have it work up and running in

559
00:29:57,179 --> 00:30:01,620
Within  5 minutes cel ehm deed dan Really

560
00:30:01,620 --> 00:30:03,179
Care About old are things The There's

561
00:30:03,179 --> 00:30:05,100
Old so the people with plugging in older

562
00:30:05,100 --> 00:30:07,140
repeaters even don't need it but Just

563
00:30:07,140 --> 00:30:08,700
Need To switch a Channel because can

564
00:30:08,700 --> 00:30:11,220
religion Channel is but it instead of

565
00:30:11,220 --> 00:30:13,020
that Just putting More repeaters  South

566
00:30:13,020 --> 00:30:15,419
Signal That's noise here and Letting The

567
00:30:15,419 --> 00:30:19,080
wi-fi's Bad so eh shaping Would Be A

568
00:30:19,080 --> 00:30:21,059
Good Idea and

569
00:30:21,059 --> 00:30:22,940
it all but the most sensitive eh

570
00:30:22,940 --> 00:30:25,559
receivers but Again Cyber ​​stalker would

571
00:30:25,559 --> 00:30:28,200
have Those receivers eh must not weable

572
00:30:28,200 --> 00:30:31,380
to find it but Again Most people One do

573
00:30:31,380 --> 00:30:32,460
that

574
00:30:32,460 --> 00:30:35,179
It's Nothing

575
00:31:05,480 --> 00:31:08,220
The really correct answer is ride the

576
00:31:08,220 --> 00:31:09,500
way

577
00:31:09,500 --> 00:31:11,480
because when you start Kiss met

578
00:31:11,480 --> 00:31:14,460
basically you ready listening and

579
00:31:14,460 --> 00:31:16,799
tracking that you can track People but

580
00:31:16,799 --> 00:31:18,720
if you just meet with Out And The Off

581
00:31:18,720 --> 00:31:21,840

586
00:31:34,380 --> 00:31:37,620
totally eh not ok This Is white set dan
