1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,539
giving nettles

2
00:00:03,419 --> 00:00:07,859
Yes welcome to this yes free lights start

3
00:00:07,859 --> 00:00:13,559
of er this fence hotel Saturday It's an

4
00:00:13,559 --> 00:00:15,540
erm not very blackish subject but

5
00:00:15,540 --> 00:00:18,720
it is a nice technical subject

6
00:00:18,720 --> 00:00:21,000
I'm going to talk to you about some

7
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:26,660
networking truths at the festival edition

8
00:00:27,359 --> 00:00:29,580
There are some really nice  standard

9
00:00:29,580 --> 00:00:32,940
and protocols that are used in today's eh internet

10
00:00:32,940 --> 00:00:34,920
and which

11
00:00:34,920 --> 00:00:36,420
are laid down in standard and

12
00:00:36,420 --> 00:00:37,980
protocols everyone knows what you

13
00:00:37,980 --> 00:00:40,800
can expect about eh because that is

14
00:00:40,800 --> 00:00:42,960
described They also have a

15
00:00:42,960 --> 00:00:45,480
very nice eh standard described so

16
00:00:45,480 --> 00:00:48,360
so-called April 1st standards that are

17
00:00:48,360 --> 00:00:51,899
among others IP over aviancarrier then

18
00:00:51,899 --> 00:00:53,340
you can continue to send the wrong internet by mail

19
00:00:53,340 --> 00:00:56,100
another famous is the

20
00:00:56,100 --> 00:00:59,100
hypertex Coffee pot control protocol about

21
00:00:59,100 --> 00:01:02,399
smart eh coffee machines

22
00:01:02,399 --> 00:01:05,519
um one stood what the Evil bit

23
00:01:05,519 --> 00:01:07,080
realizes that is very easy that the

24
00:01:07,080 --> 00:01:08,580
manager wants to harm then you put a

25
00:01:08,580 --> 00:01:10,200
certain bit and then virals

26
00:01:10,200 --> 00:01:12,900
can easily take it out again

27
00:01:12,900 --> 00:01:14,640
Neatly neat I also don't see where

28
00:01:14,640 --> 00:01:17,580
that can go wrong erm Pack date CP

29
00:01:17,580 --> 00:01:19,619
or you walk into a uh a room

30
00:01:19,619 --> 00:01:21,180
You take it as a peg on it

31
00:01:21,180 --> 00:01:23,040
is that IP information and then you know

32
00:01:23,040 --> 00:01:24,240
exactly what you have to put on here

33
00:01:24,240 --> 00:01:25,740
and at the end of your singing you're

34
00:01:25,740 --> 00:01:28,320
back to the clothespin has been field

35
00:01:28,320 --> 00:01:31,020
tested works great

36
00:01:31,020 --> 00:01:32,939
but that's not what I'm going to talk about

37
00:01:32,939 --> 00:01:35,240
today I hate talking about FC

38
00:01:35,240 --> 00:01:39,540
1925 12 Network in Truth if you  it

39
00:01:39,540 --> 00:01:41,400
searches just findable It's

40
00:01:41,400 --> 00:01:44,040
about two pages of debt so eh if

41
00:01:44,040 --> 00:01:45,979
it goes too fast but you can read it fine eh It

42
00:01:45,979 --> 00:01:49,079
's a standard that

43
00:01:49,079 --> 00:01:52,259
was written in 1996 It's not

44
00:01:52,259 --> 00:01:54,119
specifically limited to network I

45
00:01:54,119 --> 00:01:56,100
think a lot of  the things that pass you by

46
00:01:56,100 --> 00:01:58,140
they have a fairly large

47
00:01:58,140 --> 00:02:00,659
network approach but they are

48
00:02:00,659 --> 00:02:03,780
useful in a surprising number of places ehm ehm

49
00:02:03,780 --> 00:02:06,240
some of the expansions on this

50
00:02:06,240 --> 00:02:09,239
because it hasn't stood still since 1996 certainly

51
00:02:09,239 --> 00:02:11,400
not in the festival land So

52
00:02:11,400 --> 00:02:13,319
some expansions have emerged based on

53
00:02:13,319 --> 00:02:16,020
our own  experience also observation

54
00:02:16,020 --> 00:02:19,440
sometimes not quite the intention but that will

55
00:02:19,440 --> 00:02:22,200
come later A lot has happened since

56
00:02:22,200 --> 00:02:24,920
1996

57
00:02:25,500 --> 00:02:27,360
This is a bit of a setting of the Sea

58
00:02:27,360 --> 00:02:30,239
or where eh find the festival where

59
00:02:30,239 --> 00:02:32,580
I got eh example or from eh

60
00:02:32,580 --> 00:02:34,319
Where Is Dat so that has developed

61
00:02:34,319 --> 00:02:36,920
took place the event is eh

62
00:02:36,920 --> 00:02:40,140
castlefest last year in Lisse I

63
00:02:40,140 --> 00:02:41,519
will just see for the people who don't

64
00:02:41,519 --> 00:02:44,940
know that event that is on the left here

65
00:02:44,940 --> 00:02:47,220
it is the map of the

66
00:02:47,220 --> 00:02:49,379
train so not even the camping site

67
00:02:49,379 --> 00:02:51,660
but purely the train became the entrance on this side

68
00:02:51,660 --> 00:02:54,599
a stage above here another

69
00:02:54,599 --> 00:02:56,580
stage here another stage and this is

70
00:02:56,580 --> 00:02:58,680
complete grounds

71
00:02:58,680 --> 00:03:01,800
this little gray square right here in the

72
00:03:01,800 --> 00:03:03,000
middle

73
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:05,099
this very little gray square is the

74
00:03:05,099 --> 00:03:07,379
castle just to give an ID of the

75
00:03:07,379 --> 00:03:08,879
scale of the festival in the scale of

76
00:03:08,879 --> 00:03:10,860
a map

77
00:03:10,860 --> 00:03:12,599
it will come back to the places of the stage

78
00:03:12,599 --> 00:03:14,340
in detail because I still have

79
00:03:14,340 --> 00:03:17,099
something left There are three stages that

80
00:03:17,099 --> 00:03:18,840
have a keurnit program keurnites

81
00:03:18,840 --> 00:03:20,580
coordinated with each other if the one hand is built up

82
00:03:20,580 --> 00:03:22,140
is one for a podium it remains

83
00:03:22,140 --> 00:03:23,459
that audience actually says

84
00:03:23,459 --> 00:03:26,340
can always have fun on the eh festival site

85
00:03:26,340 --> 00:03:28,920
vis falls like several days lasts eh from a

86
00:03:28,920 --> 00:03:30,780
thursday afternoon evening to a friday

87
00:03:30,780 --> 00:03:33,959
saturday and sunday and then it's

88
00:03:33,959 --> 00:03:36,360
time to break down again

89
00:03:36,360 --> 00:03:38,640
i'm a bit longer on the row myself

90
00:03:38,640 --> 00:03:41,280
now three weeks so the  bilden once

91
00:03:41,280 --> 00:03:43,080
Down That also takes time to

92
00:03:43,080 --> 00:03:45,319
invite

93
00:03:45,480 --> 00:03:47,959
then we now come to the network capabilities

94
00:03:47,959 --> 00:03:51,420
the first network truth is the work

95
00:03:51,420 --> 00:03:54,360
must always work You don't know festival

96
00:03:54,360 --> 00:03:57,360
starts you know the festival ends

97
00:03:57,360 --> 00:04:00,299
before the beginning it must work

98
00:04:00,299 --> 00:04:01,920
and at the moment you  does not work

99
00:04:01,920 --> 00:04:03,120
until the last day then you have

100
00:04:03,120 --> 00:04:05,040
actually done it for nothing no matter what

101
00:04:05,040 --> 00:04:07,200
You have to prepare well always

102
00:04:07,200 --> 00:04:09,959
work the photo I have attached

103
00:04:09,959 --> 00:04:12,420
there that has enough Sweet cost a tear

104
00:04:12,420 --> 00:04:13,799
I will tell you what this

105
00:04:13,799 --> 00:04:14,659
is

106
00:04:14,659 --> 00:04:17,579
next to the stage  there is also a video's

107
00:04:17,579 --> 00:04:20,579
cream and it seems organization is a very

108
00:04:20,579 --> 00:04:22,620
nice idea that if a stage is

109
00:04:22,620 --> 00:04:24,360
converted from the most energetic to the other

110
00:04:24,360 --> 00:04:27,180
artist that on the Philips cream you can

111
00:04:27,180 --> 00:04:30,060
see something that is on the stage but do

112
00:04:30,060 --> 00:04:31,860
you have a triangle a fiber optic for

113
00:04:31,860 --> 00:04:33,479
needed It's a Roar video stream then you have

114
00:04:33,479 --> 00:04:35,100
to be shared between those three

115
00:04:35,100 --> 00:04:37,440
stages I just showed the scale

116
00:04:37,440 --> 00:04:40,860
sitting there because kilometers of fiber in between

117
00:04:40,860 --> 00:04:43,680
there is nothing so beautiful that when you have remembered to build

118
00:04:43,680 --> 00:04:46,919
a connection through all fatkast and switch panels

119
00:04:46,919 --> 00:04:49,500


120
00:04:49,500 --> 00:04:51,600
based on  fiber optic between Eden stage

121
00:04:51,600 --> 00:04:53,880
and the other stage You put a

122
00:04:53,880 --> 00:04:56,940
test light on it and then you see this it's

123
00:04:56,940 --> 00:04:58,400
not so nice

124
00:04:58,400 --> 00:05:02,100
that you know that hours you

125
00:05:02,100 --> 00:05:04,080
stormed in for Just one of those

126
00:05:04,080 --> 00:05:06,660
connections and it works you remember

127
00:05:06,660 --> 00:05:10,280
before the start  of the festival also it has to

128
00:05:10,320 --> 00:05:13,159
work

129
00:05:14,820 --> 00:05:17,880
the speed of light

130
00:05:17,880 --> 00:05:19,560
there are actually no things that

131
00:05:19,560 --> 00:05:20,880
can go faster for me Ajax has

132
00:05:20,880 --> 00:05:24,020
said some smart things about it

133
00:05:24,660 --> 00:05:26,000
and

134
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:28,800
the starting point is that it also depends on

135
00:05:28,800 --> 00:05:30,960
what you do your best You can't

136
00:05:30,960 --> 00:05:33,419
make a baby in 9  months so he breaks my

137
00:05:33,419 --> 00:05:36,000
thinking one woman ebaby So 9

138
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:38,100
Women 1 size 1 baby

139
00:05:38,100 --> 00:05:40,620
it doesn't work that way but not all prick

140
00:05:40,620 --> 00:05:45,120
managers think the same way

141
00:05:45,120 --> 00:05:48,960
so throwing on menager might make it

142
00:05:48,960 --> 00:05:51,180
a little faster it could

143
00:05:51,180 --> 00:05:53,759
also handle it differently but make

144
00:05:53,759 --> 00:05:56,699
but  then you are quite big that it

145
00:05:56,699 --> 00:05:59,300
will not get any faster,

146
00:06:03,240 --> 00:06:05,720
it mainly depends on your own experience

147
00:06:05,720 --> 00:06:08,520
Which resource you become when

148
00:06:08,520 --> 00:06:10,259
you look at Express who

149
00:06:10,259 --> 00:06:13,080
can work together, that is really the best

150
00:06:13,080 --> 00:06:14,820
of the best, but people work together

151
00:06:14,820 --> 00:06:16,740
Are crazy enough about  still worth more

152
00:06:16,740 --> 00:06:19,380
than people who are far away because that man

153
00:06:19,380 --> 00:06:21,120
sometimes against that disagreement here and

154
00:06:21,120 --> 00:06:22,680
there eh on

155
00:06:22,680 --> 00:06:25,259
Flying pics I liked this one so much

156
00:06:25,259 --> 00:06:27,419
that I will come back to it for the rest eh

157
00:06:27,419 --> 00:06:29,460
but I'll take it here

158
00:06:29,460 --> 00:06:32,039
with you all for a while  because of this is a Vision

159
00:06:32,039 --> 00:06:35,280
Trust pigs Fly just fine however this is

160
00:06:35,280 --> 00:06:38,280
not necessary good idear It's Hard to be

161
00:06:38,280 --> 00:06:40,319
sure where I going to land and it Could

162
00:06:40,319 --> 00:06:42,240
Be Dangerous Sitting under Them as They

163
00:06:42,240 --> 00:06:44,759
Fly overhead

164
00:06:44,759 --> 00:06:46,500
apart from the petting zoo we had

165
00:06:46,500 --> 00:06:49,199
no pigs at castlefest though

166
00:06:49,199 --> 00:06:50,300
access point

167
00:06:50,300 --> 00:06:53,819
they fly badly I can tell you

168
00:06:53,819 --> 00:06:56,280
This is a uh a picture of uh the erm

169
00:06:56,280 --> 00:06:59,160
build-up during the festival uh the

170
00:06:59,160 --> 00:07:01,860
sure for Backstage these are the social

171
00:07:01,860 --> 00:07:03,419
media containers that are the people who

172
00:07:03,419 --> 00:07:05,819


173
00:07:05,819 --> 00:07:07,020
keep an eye on the tweets e-mails  answering and stuff like that

174
00:07:07,020 --> 00:07:08,940
and we have a

175
00:07:08,940 --> 00:07:10,740
fair amount of nice wi-fi coverage on site the

176
00:07:10,740 --> 00:07:12,900
train is quite big but then you come

177
00:07:12,900 --> 00:07:16,380
with 35 XS Points that we had quite far

178
00:07:16,380 --> 00:07:18,900
eh how do you get eh even further with an

179
00:07:18,900 --> 00:07:20,639
exponention place  up so we had

180
00:07:20,639 --> 00:07:22,740
on the roof we had placed eh three Access

181
00:07:22,740 --> 00:07:25,560
Points at the Tear down is one

182
00:07:25,560 --> 00:07:27,240
of those things eh didn't like it anymore

183
00:07:27,240 --> 00:07:28,979
and also from the festival that jumped

184
00:07:28,979 --> 00:07:30,360
off its twig from those boots

185
00:07:30,360 --> 00:07:32,660
down onto it

186
00:07:32,660 --> 00:07:36,479
luckily it didn't fall  on top of someone

187
00:07:36,479 --> 00:07:38,099
things weigh quite a lot between

188
00:07:38,099 --> 00:07:40,979
metal housing I have not tested with I

189
00:07:40,979 --> 00:07:42,240
wouldn't be surprised if it works again

190
00:07:42,240 --> 00:07:44,000


191
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:46,020
And see where I'm going to put it again

192
00:07:46,020 --> 00:07:48,000
so flying compartments we had no

193
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:52,520
trouble sand flying Yes one this year

194
00:07:58,319 --> 00:08:03,599
sometimes you can really  feeling

195
00:08:03,840 --> 00:08:07,199
how much time and mother it takes to

196
00:08:07,199 --> 00:08:10,319
keep something operational when you've

197
00:08:10,319 --> 00:08:12,060
had to deal with the same one all seems

198
00:08:12,060 --> 00:08:15,180
pretty simple Who doesn't know the internet well

199
00:08:15,180 --> 00:08:16,500
everyone has it at home everyone

200
00:08:16,500 --> 00:08:17,940
also has it in a certain way and

201
00:08:17,940 --> 00:08:19,580
if it doesn't work then

202
00:08:19,580 --> 00:08:22,680
keep the magic plug in the wall

203
00:08:22,680 --> 00:08:24,780
keep it at work or your wi-fi has

204
00:08:24,780 --> 00:08:28,139
stopped working And sometimes it's

205
00:08:28,139 --> 00:08:29,660
easy surprise for

206
00:08:29,660 --> 00:08:32,159
someone standing just a little further away

207
00:08:32,159 --> 00:08:35,899
to see why it's not working

208
00:08:36,419 --> 00:08:38,640
but or you generally recognize  that only

209
00:08:38,640 --> 00:08:40,679
when you eh know a little more

210
00:08:40,679 --> 00:08:42,360
about it because then you can just

211
00:08:42,360 --> 00:08:44,099
say here long side it will be and then

212
00:08:44,099 --> 00:08:45,420
you will be there Hey but network does

213
00:08:45,420 --> 00:08:47,820
not work the rewards of those two battle

214
00:08:47,820 --> 00:08:50,839
insight and experience

215
00:08:52,980 --> 00:08:56,640
about consulation too much  together

216
00:08:56,640 --> 00:08:59,060
It is always possible to condense several uh

217
00:08:59,060 --> 00:09:01,680
different problems into one big

218
00:09:01,680 --> 00:09:04,260
depending comes uh solution

219
00:09:04,260 --> 00:09:06,120
and in most of the time it's a bad

220
00:09:06,120 --> 00:09:07,560
idea

221
00:09:07,560 --> 00:09:08,580
I'll give a little

222
00:09:08,580 --> 00:09:10,200
background on this picture

223
00:09:10,200 --> 00:09:13,080
uh in one of those portal Camps

224
00:09:13,080 --> 00:09:15,420
you saw sitting there  to

225
00:09:15,420 --> 00:09:17,220
attract people It was also one of the places where

226
00:09:17,220 --> 00:09:19,980
So network was needed I made a eh

227
00:09:19,980 --> 00:09:21,660
shoot it nice network and I

228
00:09:21,660 --> 00:09:23,040
also made the back network

229
00:09:23,040 --> 00:09:25,440
with a nice penalty connection to

230
00:09:25,440 --> 00:09:27,180
at one point I received complaints

231
00:09:27,180 --> 00:09:30,000
from eh the party  who were behind the

232
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:31,740
people who were working there that

233
00:09:31,740 --> 00:09:34,019
there was no network anymore as it turns out

234
00:09:34,019 --> 00:09:35,700
Well they were here finished

235
00:09:35,700 --> 00:09:37,680
working and says yes unpacks those persés but

236
00:09:37,680 --> 00:09:39,300
withdraw all the stessen and that's where

237
00:09:39,300 --> 00:09:42,079
my network went

238
00:09:43,019 --> 00:09:45,720
so transfer mitigation plug it there  but

239
00:09:45,720 --> 00:09:47,160
at work I am already consciously quite

240
00:09:47,160 --> 00:09:49,080
available I can lead to some tension and sensation here and there

241
00:09:49,080 --> 00:09:52,279


242
00:09:53,720 --> 00:09:55,620
problems

243
00:09:55,620 --> 00:09:57,180
It is easier to move the problem

244
00:09:57,180 --> 00:09:58,980


245
00:09:58,980 --> 00:10:01,800
than to solve it somewhere it is usually

246
00:10:01,800 --> 00:10:03,540
a bit more difficult I have

247
00:10:03,540 --> 00:10:05,399
limited capacity here now but fine then we will get

248
00:10:05,399 --> 00:10:07,080
it here  we put away some capacity and then

249
00:10:07,080 --> 00:10:09,600
we put it here and then you have

250
00:10:09,600 --> 00:10:11,459
solved your problem but it may well

251
00:10:11,459 --> 00:10:12,899
be that you have made it a problem there

252
00:10:12,899 --> 00:10:15,060
that goes for wi-fi coverage

253
00:10:15,060 --> 00:10:16,680
that applies to process and capass that

254
00:10:16,680 --> 00:10:18,120
applies to the whole  a lot of this sort of thing

255
00:10:18,120 --> 00:10:21,480
So changing designs is a

256
00:10:21,480 --> 00:10:23,220
uh way to solve that But that's

257
00:10:23,220 --> 00:10:24,380
usually going to be necessary

258
00:10:24,380 --> 00:10:27,060
revsource mates who have fashion

259
00:10:27,060 --> 00:10:29,420
it's always possible to take a

260
00:10:29,420 --> 00:10:32,480
next level of in Direction keys

261
00:10:32,480 --> 00:10:35,040
ie what you have here now  capacity

262
00:10:35,040 --> 00:10:37,320
problem yes it just ticks it in it

263
00:10:37,320 --> 00:10:39,000
has two weeks on time and at the

264
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:40,320
end of those two weeks then say

265
00:10:40,320 --> 00:10:42,240
well fine what I had put here

266
00:10:42,240 --> 00:10:43,800
I will then pick it up and put it

267
00:10:43,800 --> 00:10:45,660
back here again which ultimately

268
00:10:45,660 --> 00:10:49,399
capacity problems that  am I making it in

269
00:10:53,339 --> 00:10:57,079
finding ehm the problem is sometimes

270
00:10:57,079 --> 00:10:59,579
apparently very complex the best

271
00:10:59,579 --> 00:11:01,260
question you can ask is what has

272
00:11:01,260 --> 00:11:04,079
changed and of course nothing has ever

273
00:11:04,079 --> 00:11:05,279
changed with it It always

274
00:11:05,279 --> 00:11:08,160
came up spontaneously and then you start looking a little

275
00:11:08,160 --> 00:11:10,320
further  and talk a little further and

276
00:11:10,320 --> 00:11:12,720
ask a little more so oh yes we have

277
00:11:12,720 --> 00:11:14,220
that too but that has nothing

278
00:11:14,220 --> 00:11:16,459
to do with it anyway there

279
00:11:17,399 --> 00:11:19,560
are a few people I

280
00:11:19,560 --> 00:11:21,180
assume that if they say there is a

281
00:11:21,180 --> 00:11:22,560
work problem there is also a network

282
00:11:22,560 --> 00:11:25,079
problem because the  best question you

283
00:11:25,079 --> 00:11:27,779
can ask then is why do you think that

284
00:11:27,779 --> 00:11:29,579
and the people who have thought about it

285
00:11:29,579 --> 00:11:32,279
come up with Well because I've seen that and

286
00:11:32,279 --> 00:11:33,779
then you have to pay attention because then

287
00:11:33,779 --> 00:11:36,060
next things that might

288
00:11:36,060 --> 00:11:37,500
have had something to do with it but who wants a

289
00:11:37,500 --> 00:11:39,180
lot  gives more background information

290
00:11:39,180 --> 00:11:40,920
than No nothing has changed really

291
00:11:40,920 --> 00:11:42,360
not

292
00:11:42,360 --> 00:11:44,760
never No voltage is on I have

293
00:11:44,760 --> 00:11:48,480
not updated anything have not been set up again

294
00:11:48,480 --> 00:11:50,459
There has been no truck in costs

295
00:11:50,459 --> 00:11:53,959
yet any that have not changed

296
00:11:55,079 --> 00:11:58,579
I hear recognition always nice

297
00:11:59,100 --> 00:12:02,459
There is always something This is a  of the

298
00:12:02,459 --> 00:12:04,500
most famous parts of FC negative 25

299
00:12:04,500 --> 00:12:06,320
that a lot of people recognize

300
00:12:06,320 --> 00:12:10,519
Good Fast cheap

301
00:12:13,040 --> 00:12:15,600
enough annoys then you only have one

302
00:12:15,600 --> 00:12:19,399
And you don't even get to choose Which one

303
00:12:19,860 --> 00:12:23,160
count on it it's not

304
00:12:23,160 --> 00:12:28,459
going to be cheap like this six so Switch

305
00:12:33,420 --> 00:12:36,660
It's always harder that  you think i

306
00:12:36,660 --> 00:12:38,640
was just talking about that glass is ring and how

307
00:12:38,640 --> 00:12:40,620
beautiful it is that works even before the start

308
00:12:40,620 --> 00:12:42,600
of the festival

309
00:12:42,600 --> 00:12:44,700
This is one of the places on the

310
00:12:44,700 --> 00:12:47,279
leftmost stage on the map where they

311
00:12:47,279 --> 00:12:49,380


312
00:12:49,380 --> 00:12:51,420
had, among other things, that Rod video stream that they under  other

313
00:12:51,420 --> 00:12:55,380
wanted to send the internet I counted to be

314
00:12:55,380 --> 00:12:58,139
eight connections between This box and

315
00:12:58,139 --> 00:12:59,880
the main stage part in building

316
00:12:59,880 --> 00:13:01,740
part and field box

317
00:13:01,740 --> 00:13:04,019
and that's also why it takes several hours

318
00:13:04,019 --> 00:13:05,579
Dude before you even build one such

319
00:13:05,579 --> 00:13:07,560
connection

320
00:13:07,560 --> 00:13:10,200
it's a lot more  work behind that you

321
00:13:10,200 --> 00:13:12,660
suspect

322
00:13:12,660 --> 00:13:14,880
fiber optic aim fortunately partly that

323
00:13:14,880 --> 00:13:16,440
in the ground also roll our own rolls

324
00:13:16,440 --> 00:13:18,839
I'll come back to that in a moment erm apart

325
00:13:18,839 --> 00:13:21,899
fiber optic profession is separate and

326
00:13:21,899 --> 00:13:23,040
fortunately have a number of

327
00:13:23,040 --> 00:13:24,600
experts work I just heard a well-known

328
00:13:24,600 --> 00:13:26,120
name  for additional purchases that is one of our

329
00:13:26,120 --> 00:13:28,680
fiber optic experts and we have

330
00:13:28,680 --> 00:13:30,240
worked with him enough that I

331
00:13:30,240 --> 00:13:32,880
can fake myself that I got rid

332
00:13:32,880 --> 00:13:36,540


333
00:13:36,540 --> 00:13:38,459


334
00:13:38,459 --> 00:13:39,480
of it.

335
00:13:39,480 --> 00:13:42,120
roll extra many eh one bottle of wax

336
00:13:42,120 --> 00:13:44,519
that we have eradicated a part

337
00:13:44,519 --> 00:13:45,839
we use an industrituren on the

338
00:13:45,839 --> 00:13:47,519
site and the whole rolls out itself that

339
00:13:47,519 --> 00:13:50,279
is about a meter high Reel And there

340
00:13:50,279 --> 00:13:53,420
is only 300 on

341
00:14:01,320 --> 00:14:05,160
my father a good question um

342
00:14:05,160 --> 00:14:09,180
in general  not eh the reason very

343
00:14:09,180 --> 00:14:12,600
simple eh eh cost and complexity we

344
00:14:12,600 --> 00:14:14,880
often still have plans eh me I'll

345
00:14:14,880 --> 00:14:16,920
give a somewhat responsive example

346
00:14:16,920 --> 00:14:18,620
um

347
00:14:18,620 --> 00:14:21,480
generators there are a number of generators

348
00:14:21,480 --> 00:14:22,560
on the site that

349
00:14:22,560 --> 00:14:25,380
provide the energy supply eh and we Bun

350
00:14:25,380 --> 00:14:27,360
up for those 20  agathe in my opinion one

351
00:14:27,360 --> 00:14:30,060
spare aggregate although usually a bit

352
00:14:30,060 --> 00:14:32,519
smaller because of the simple ones that very big

353
00:14:32,519 --> 00:14:33,779
guys Can't you flog with the Mani

354
00:14:33,779 --> 00:14:37,019
the eh quad is smaller and eh

355
00:14:37,019 --> 00:14:39,180
in a lot of places it's better something than

356
00:14:39,180 --> 00:14:40,740
something and then you just put it against the people

357
00:14:40,740 --> 00:14:43,220
the one there is that of no sorry

358
00:14:43,220 --> 00:14:44,940
full stop monitors where to buy in a

359
00:14:44,940 --> 00:14:48,139
coffee maker don't use it right away

360
00:14:48,560 --> 00:14:50,820
rule but set up something else on

361
00:14:50,820 --> 00:14:52,880
another generator

362
00:14:52,880 --> 00:14:55,560
at that level it is possible to integrate eh in

363
00:14:55,560 --> 00:14:59,339
terms of networking this from the glass is in

364
00:14:59,339 --> 00:15:00,959
the ground eh so that's  not eh

365
00:15:00,959 --> 00:15:02,519
available for visitors or

366
00:15:02,519 --> 00:15:05,220
quarillende constant that won't last a

367
00:15:05,220 --> 00:15:07,199
while the event is

368
00:15:07,199 --> 00:15:10,440
only 3.5 days

369
00:15:10,440 --> 00:15:11,880
that's not that big and at the moment

370
00:15:11,880 --> 00:15:13,760
you have to spend a lot of money to

371
00:15:13,760 --> 00:15:17,399
build um sufficiently into the dance

372
00:15:17,399 --> 00:15:19,320
that's quite tricky we already have what's

373
00:15:19,320 --> 00:15:21,480
in a nasi It's a eh Sissel base

374
00:15:21,480 --> 00:15:23,820
Network the course switch is redundant the

375
00:15:23,820 --> 00:15:25,680
value of controls are renodante and

376
00:15:25,680 --> 00:15:27,180
I'm talking about spare Access Points

377
00:15:27,180 --> 00:15:29,399
and a few spare exercises and

378
00:15:29,399 --> 00:15:32,339
of course whatever or whatever on the  graceful in terms of

379
00:15:32,339 --> 00:15:35,100
design it is usually singular only

380
00:15:35,100 --> 00:15:38,459
um in one place it is eh Renault

381
00:15:38,459 --> 00:15:41,100
executed eh and independent we have some

382
00:15:41,100 --> 00:15:42,899
continence plantsim Place that if

383
00:15:42,899 --> 00:15:44,579
indeed we had that long piece

384
00:15:44,579 --> 00:15:46,500
then we have enough material to

385
00:15:46,500 --> 00:15:48,660
hear something further but keep it  take into

386
00:15:48,660 --> 00:15:49,800
account certainly if it's during

387
00:15:49,800 --> 00:15:52,620
opening hours that's now a few hours

388
00:15:52,620 --> 00:15:54,420
go back again to the very first

389
00:15:54,420 --> 00:15:55,680
closes we've seen it has to

390
00:15:55,680 --> 00:15:57,180
work

391
00:15:57,180 --> 00:16:01,440
and it's a trade off so yes to a

392
00:16:01,440 --> 00:16:04,880
certain extent well really not all over

393
00:16:04,880 --> 00:16:07,740
tam budget and also space contrance the

394
00:16:07,740 --> 00:16:09,540
more part  of the network stuff comes

395
00:16:09,540 --> 00:16:10,940
in

396
00:16:10,940 --> 00:16:13,620
one trailer and two follow to the

397
00:16:13,620 --> 00:16:16,199
cars this way and that car is

398
00:16:16,199 --> 00:16:19,079
quite heavy already ingerie because stuff

399
00:16:19,079 --> 00:16:22,459
already weighs a bit especially ups

400
00:16:22,800 --> 00:16:24,660
this picture so nice a little more

401
00:16:24,660 --> 00:16:25,760
somewhere

402
00:16:25,760 --> 00:16:28,199
for all Resources of whatever It Is You

403
00:16:28,199 --> 00:16:30,839
need more it's a bit difficult to see in this photo

404
00:16:30,839 --> 00:16:32,279
but I can tell you what you can

405
00:16:32,279 --> 00:16:34,740
see this is the directing container at

406
00:16:34,740 --> 00:16:37,199
the leftmost stage

407
00:16:37,199 --> 00:16:41,220
erm that's what went besides the glass fibers from

408
00:16:41,220 --> 00:16:43,880
Vrij itself I also rolled out a roll of 300 m

409
00:16:43,880 --> 00:16:45,860
doorbouche

410
00:16:45,860 --> 00:16:48,959
and  according to our Estimate based on the

411
00:16:48,959 --> 00:16:51,240
map, we needed 290 meters and

412
00:16:51,240 --> 00:16:53,279
we had 300 m, so it was

413
00:16:53,279 --> 00:16:55,320
built quite slowly,

414
00:16:55,320 --> 00:16:57,600
a fiber optic runs

415
00:16:57,600 --> 00:17:00,139
to here

416
00:17:00,420 --> 00:17:03,439
It has to go to the container,

417
00:17:04,319 --> 00:17:08,939
that saves 300 M, saves 5 M.

418
00:17:08,939 --> 00:17:11,299


419
00:17:11,299 --> 00:17:14,339


420
00:17:14,339 --> 00:17:15,720
pull it out No I'm not that far for

421
00:17:15,720 --> 00:17:17,579
fiberglass No because I did I

422
00:17:17,579 --> 00:17:19,260
pulled back a bit I put it in

423
00:17:19,260 --> 00:17:21,419
a eh no longer wortherproof container

424
00:17:21,419 --> 00:17:23,579
and I extended

425
00:17:23,579 --> 00:17:25,919
it was most frustrating I can

426
00:17:25,919 --> 00:17:27,540
tell you at the end of the evaluation

427
00:17:27,540 --> 00:17:29,940
because  then I saw the floor plant next

428
00:17:29,940 --> 00:17:31,500
year is Ah nice Jelle you have my

429
00:17:31,500 --> 00:17:33,179
request to put that container a little further

430
00:17:33,179 --> 00:17:34,020
this way you

431
00:17:34,020 --> 00:17:35,820
bet they say no that is the

432
00:17:35,820 --> 00:17:37,980
floor plan for this year he

433
00:17:37,980 --> 00:17:40,620
put it a little far back

434
00:17:40,620 --> 00:17:42,780
prune when evaluating that your measurements

435
00:17:42,780 --> 00:17:44,340
were absolutely correct that it had

436
00:17:44,340 --> 00:17:46,320
worked and that someone thought that

437
00:17:46,320 --> 00:17:49,820
was a better place and that you

438
00:17:50,039 --> 00:17:53,240
had extra work

439
00:17:54,840 --> 00:17:57,660
because it never fits All no matter

440
00:17:57,660 --> 00:17:59,700
how big it is no matter how

441
00:17:59,700 --> 00:18:02,039
small it is this is a  of those

442
00:18:02,039 --> 00:18:04,080
field cabinets I'm talking about there is an

443
00:18:04,080 --> 00:18:05,600
eh

444
00:18:05,600 --> 00:18:08,220
terrain there is an eh industrial

445
00:18:08,220 --> 00:18:11,820
switching and if it is really necessary then another

446
00:18:11,820 --> 00:18:13,980
one will fit in but not

447
00:18:13,980 --> 00:18:16,260
very much then you have to do some tricks with

448
00:18:16,260 --> 00:18:20,660
eh right angle eh voltage connectors eh

449
00:18:20,660 --> 00:18:23,460
carefully  make sure that the grass fiber that

450
00:18:23,460 --> 00:18:26,460
wants to connect it

451
00:18:26,460 --> 00:18:28,740
doesn't need too much light because

452
00:18:28,740 --> 00:18:31,740
it makes a pretty strong Bone

453
00:18:31,740 --> 00:18:33,660
if necessary this fits This has worked

454
00:18:33,660 --> 00:18:38,360
it's had But it's not about

455
00:18:41,580 --> 00:18:44,039
new ideas

456
00:18:44,039 --> 00:18:46,679
every idea

457
00:18:46,679 --> 00:18:48,480
goes again with new ones

458
00:18:48,480 --> 00:18:49,980


459
00:18:49,980 --> 00:18:51,960
you can't just re-introduce a name or a new thought graph

460
00:18:51,960 --> 00:18:54,360
and then you say no I

461
00:18:54,360 --> 00:18:55,679
also chatted that up last time that does

462
00:18:55,679 --> 00:18:57,720
n't work because Yes but this is different now Well

463
00:18:57,720 --> 00:19:00,240
okay tell me how it's different and then

464
00:19:00,240 --> 00:19:03,120
it's almost never  otherwise

465
00:19:03,120 --> 00:19:06,360
this is eh what you see here is eh the same

466
00:19:06,360 --> 00:19:07,500
container with a very nice

467
00:19:07,500 --> 00:19:09,120
connection on it eh this

468
00:19:09,120 --> 00:19:11,720
directional contratrainer is equipped with a

469
00:19:11,720 --> 00:19:14,100
fiber optic connection but further on

470
00:19:14,100 --> 00:19:15,780
we also needed some coverage so then

471
00:19:15,780 --> 00:19:17,460
we have a microwave connection around that

472
00:19:17,460 --> 00:19:19,799
at Mast just one more small piece

473
00:19:19,799 --> 00:19:21,720
continue You can't do everything with

474
00:19:21,720 --> 00:19:23,400
fiberglass because there are others because of

475
00:19:23,400 --> 00:19:26,100
costs, among other things, because yes and is

476
00:19:26,100 --> 00:19:28,140
it useful at all for that live stream and

477
00:19:28,140 --> 00:19:29,760
the stream video has that absolute benefit

478
00:19:29,760 --> 00:19:31,260
because if you see videos in red, it is

479
00:19:31,260 --> 00:19:33,539
unfortunately not about ethernet that had my

480
00:19:33,539 --> 00:19:35,100
work  made an easier that's

481
00:19:35,100 --> 00:19:36,780
just Roll video stream but good There are

482
00:19:36,780 --> 00:19:38,160
behind that there are the experts who

483
00:19:38,160 --> 00:19:40,140
got everything from there eh there's my

484
00:19:40,140 --> 00:19:41,520
ankle the field we just need a

485
00:19:41,520 --> 00:19:43,260
piece of Dark fiber from one

486
00:19:43,260 --> 00:19:45,539
train eh from the side of the train to

487
00:19:45,539 --> 00:19:48,539
the  other side of the train eh that

488
00:19:48,539 --> 00:19:50,400
arranges but okay then we did

489
00:19:50,400 --> 00:19:51,720
indeed arrange it with the

490
00:19:51,720 --> 00:19:53,100
necessary

491
00:19:53,100 --> 00:19:55,879
trips

492
00:19:57,600 --> 00:20:00,120
back to the scale of the

493
00:20:00,120 --> 00:20:01,740
festival

494
00:20:01,740 --> 00:20:03,360
I just showed a map

495
00:20:03,360 --> 00:20:06,660
of the event itself if you now

496
00:20:06,660 --> 00:20:10,820
look to the left then that is the  festival camping

497
00:20:11,220 --> 00:20:13,440
Yes it was really that close to each other

498
00:20:13,440 --> 00:20:15,679


499
00:20:17,700 --> 00:20:20,160
We were just not full But you ca

500
00:20:20,160 --> 00:20:21,480
n't plan it completely full because the

501
00:20:21,480 --> 00:20:22,980
man will blast it in advance

502
00:20:22,980 --> 00:20:24,539
We all know we all know

503
00:20:24,539 --> 00:20:26,400
Murphy then you know that you are suddenly

504
00:20:26,400 --> 00:20:29,340
short of retten but  so it was so full at

505
00:20:29,340 --> 00:20:30,299
one point at the festival

506
00:20:30,299 --> 00:20:32,160
camping

507
00:20:32,160 --> 00:20:34,620
I'm including the photo on the right because they

508
00:20:34,620 --> 00:20:36,539
earn it These are all

509
00:20:36,539 --> 00:20:38,160
volunteers who form the technical service

510
00:20:38,160 --> 00:20:40,320
of the festival

511
00:20:40,320 --> 00:20:44,340
water drainage water drainage gas electricity and

512
00:20:44,340 --> 00:20:47,940
network These are all the people who are

513
00:20:47,940 --> 00:20:49,260
part of  making the festival possible

514
00:20:49,260 --> 00:20:51,379


515
00:20:56,580 --> 00:20:58,559
designing a protocol to

516
00:20:58,559 --> 00:21:01,380
standard is quite difficult Fortunately you have

517
00:21:01,380 --> 00:21:03,720
standard bodies for that that

518
00:21:03,720 --> 00:21:05,160
think well everyone Express

519
00:21:05,160 --> 00:21:08,480
together rides and the messages are usually

520
00:21:08,480 --> 00:21:11,340
improtocol designing you have only

521
00:21:11,340 --> 00:21:13,080
reached a level of Perfection not

522
00:21:13,080 --> 00:21:14,460
when there is nothing to add  to add

523
00:21:14,460 --> 00:21:18,120
when there is nothing to leave out

524
00:21:18,120 --> 00:21:20,100
my addition to it is until then

525
00:21:20,100 --> 00:21:23,240
you have to make do with what you have

526
00:21:23,400 --> 00:21:26,100
take enough spare parts with you the

527
00:21:26,100 --> 00:21:27,720
yield rate me what if something happens

528
00:21:27,720 --> 00:21:31,100
et cetera And prepare for everything

529
00:21:31,100 --> 00:21:33,299
left is the trailer where  I was talking about

530
00:21:33,299 --> 00:21:35,400
if one of the parts of the

531
00:21:35,400 --> 00:21:37,860
stuff we brought

532
00:21:37,860 --> 00:21:39,179
is also there somewhere I don't know exactly what's in there is

533
00:21:39,179 --> 00:21:40,860
a chainsaw in between it lasts

534
00:21:40,860 --> 00:21:43,320
a very long time have to

535
00:21:43,320 --> 00:21:44,820
tell you It hasn't been a year

536
00:21:44,820 --> 00:21:46,740
since we got the chainsaw  have not

537
00:21:46,740 --> 00:21:50,880
needed the photo on the right is the arrival day of

538
00:21:50,880 --> 00:21:53,640
the pre-construction so take a b2.5 week before

539
00:21:53,640 --> 00:21:55,620
the festival

540
00:21:55,620 --> 00:21:57,539
then a tree was decided It was

541
00:21:57,539 --> 00:21:59,640
beautiful weather It still just makes

542
00:21:59,640 --> 00:22:01,919
an Estate closed tree It has

543
00:22:01,919 --> 00:22:04,320
been beautiful for a while now and it is

544
00:22:04,320 --> 00:22:06,840
came down for three quarters

545
00:22:06,840 --> 00:22:08,460
Fortunately no one was hurt

546
00:22:08,460 --> 00:22:10,260
the car rats Where scratcher on the

547
00:22:10,260 --> 00:22:12,059
hood

548
00:22:12,059 --> 00:22:14,520
and the trailer is not yet getting cold on the

549
00:22:14,520 --> 00:22:17,520
terrain left already needed it

550
00:22:17,520 --> 00:22:19,879
so

551
00:22:20,700 --> 00:22:22,440
hey nothing happened to the glass wipe

552
00:22:22,440 --> 00:22:23,880
No it wasn't even then  unpacked that

553
00:22:23,880 --> 00:22:25,559
was arrival

554
00:22:25,559 --> 00:22:29,640
Yes that was then come along eh

555
00:22:29,640 --> 00:22:31,679
reach ahead of everything make sure you are ahead

556
00:22:31,679 --> 00:22:33,600
Take spare stuff with you and it

557
00:22:33,600 --> 00:22:35,039
doesn't matter if you think

558
00:22:35,039 --> 00:22:37,020
it's coming a Bas and you have room for

559
00:22:37,020 --> 00:22:39,620
just take it with you

560
00:22:40,559 --> 00:22:43,080
then there will be  what These were 12 standards

561
00:22:43,080 --> 00:22:45,720
that are odil of the ROC

562
00:22:45,720 --> 00:22:47,220
so I have some other

563
00:22:47,220 --> 00:22:49,260
additions myself and that is, among other things,

564
00:22:49,260 --> 00:22:52,320
that the world around us is changing do

565
00:22:52,320 --> 00:22:54,480
I already told in 1996 there is a

566
00:22:54,480 --> 00:22:56,700
lot happening in the world So there are

567
00:22:56,700 --> 00:22:58,919
some standards some extras

568
00:22:58,919 --> 00:23:01,080
added and some requirement

569
00:23:01,080 --> 00:23:02,460
Change in the past if you understood that about

570
00:23:02,460 --> 00:23:04,020
fiberglass then you had enough for the

571
00:23:04,020 --> 00:23:06,240
rest of your life nowadays Do you

572
00:23:06,240 --> 00:23:08,159
also need a little more knowledge than the names

573
00:23:08,159 --> 00:23:10,740
as networks so we program knowledge

574
00:23:10,740 --> 00:23:12,480
here and there  piping is

575
00:23:12,480 --> 00:23:15,419
indeed something that also comes standard with eh the

576
00:23:15,419 --> 00:23:18,179
knowledge area child I'm

577
00:23:18,179 --> 00:23:19,860
not very handy inside yet to come up with the beginning

578
00:23:19,860 --> 00:23:22,620
so we came is Change so that

579
00:23:22,620 --> 00:23:24,179
means we stuff you take with me in

580
00:23:24,179 --> 00:23:25,200
my collision that also change your boat

581
00:23:25,200 --> 00:23:27,559


582
00:23:29,520 --> 00:23:31,520
automation Island

583
00:23:31,520 --> 00:23:34,740
I know I say that to the entire public I

584
00:23:34,740 --> 00:23:35,600


585
00:23:35,600 --> 00:23:38,760
don't always answer automatically I will

586
00:23:38,760 --> 00:23:40,260
give it for example You have a

587
00:23:40,260 --> 00:23:42,480
challenge and you want to solve it you find

588
00:23:42,480 --> 00:23:44,039
a script on the internet that does

589
00:23:44,039 --> 00:23:45,659
what you want

590
00:23:45,659 --> 00:23:48,120
and then you say yes hello update it  gripje

591
00:23:48,120 --> 00:23:50,820
but and then the question is if gripje will

592
00:23:50,820 --> 00:23:52,980
still do what you want in a year's time will

593
00:23:52,980 --> 00:23:54,919
he not do other things you don't want

594
00:23:54,919 --> 00:23:59,400
How do you know what you are automating and then

595
00:23:59,400 --> 00:24:01,260
it will usually be if you know what you are

596
00:24:01,260 --> 00:24:03,780
automating can you automate it to  to

597
00:24:03,780 --> 00:24:05,580
make something easier and not to

598
00:24:05,580 --> 00:24:07,620
make it invisible because often when

599
00:24:07,620 --> 00:24:09,299
things go wrong

600
00:24:09,299 --> 00:24:13,340
you are 30 in the back of your trobben shooting

601
00:24:13,559 --> 00:24:15,780
And as usual this is also a

602
00:24:15,780 --> 00:24:17,520
very nice example of There's always

603
00:24:17,520 --> 00:24:19,440
and a Project X case video and I found this

604
00:24:19,440 --> 00:24:22,880
a  very nice to put with this

605
00:24:27,299 --> 00:24:30,500
proper preparations

606
00:24:30,740 --> 00:24:33,179
straight setup eh am I now

607
00:24:33,179 --> 00:24:34,799
a bit dead Tester does Act Whether the

608
00:24:34,799 --> 00:24:36,240
stuff in between was allowed What has eh

609
00:24:36,240 --> 00:24:38,580
come through and eh Look how the

610
00:24:38,580 --> 00:24:40,440
configuration was already put together for

611
00:24:40,440 --> 00:24:41,940
me it was also 2 years ago  since

612
00:24:41,940 --> 00:24:43,080
last had an event

613
00:24:43,080 --> 00:24:45,419
and on the left is the preparation

614
00:24:45,419 --> 00:24:48,360
of our great friend who says Well I

615
00:24:48,360 --> 00:24:50,280
've got a fridge and my beer and some

616
00:24:50,280 --> 00:24:53,700
spare cable and I'm ready for

617
00:24:53,700 --> 00:24:58,039
feed preparations to come Is shapes and sizes

618
00:24:59,880 --> 00:25:02,039
some work should be left

619
00:25:02,039 --> 00:25:04,080
to the press

620
00:25:04,080 --> 00:25:05,940
Apart from the fact that fortunately there are a number of

621
00:25:05,940 --> 00:25:07,740
permanent buildings on the site with

622
00:25:07,740 --> 00:25:09,140
fiber optic, there

623
00:25:09,140 --> 00:25:12,000
are also a number of

624
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:13,380
facilities on the site such as a

625
00:25:13,380 --> 00:25:17,240
sewer at the moment that becomes clogged

626
00:25:17,240 --> 00:25:20,000
I don't want to concern myself with it

627
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:22,559
and that's where I have the spudnetwin  not

628
00:25:22,559 --> 00:25:24,659
past me

629
00:25:24,659 --> 00:25:26,700
fortunately the experts you can

630
00:25:26,700 --> 00:25:28,740
hire who come along fortunately it is

631
00:25:28,740 --> 00:25:30,720
still under construction So uh during that

632
00:25:30,720 --> 00:25:32,700
festival we had no uh problems with the

633
00:25:32,700 --> 00:25:34,679
sewage system but some things you have to

634
00:25:34,679 --> 00:25:36,299
leave to the experts that applies to

635
00:25:36,299 --> 00:25:39,440
everything and everyone

636
00:25:42,059 --> 00:25:44,700
timing is everything  during the build-up there have

637
00:25:44,700 --> 00:25:48,020


638
00:25:48,020 --> 00:25:49,919
been eh daily catch-up sessions in a

639
00:25:49,919 --> 00:25:51,900
live stream that you can watch from different eh

640
00:25:51,900 --> 00:25:53,700
parts of the stage with belt I see

641
00:25:53,700 --> 00:25:55,559
someone followed a nod

642
00:25:55,559 --> 00:25:57,179
then you probably saw them pass by

643
00:25:57,179 --> 00:25:59,460
this is on the stage and

644
00:25:59,460 --> 00:26:00,960
closest to this is the Village always

645
00:26:00,960 --> 00:26:02,520
So the stage on the far right of the

646
00:26:02,520 --> 00:26:05,400
map ehm and there you see so eh can I have

647
00:26:05,400 --> 00:26:07,320
a Femke who becomes those shapes then have a

648
00:26:07,320 --> 00:26:09,240
good conversation about the line-up

649
00:26:09,240 --> 00:26:10,740
they did and things like that at

650
00:26:10,740 --> 00:26:11,880
one point you saw Femke saw you

651
00:26:11,880 --> 00:26:14,520
Look back what he heard what this

652
00:26:14,520 --> 00:26:16,860
was about 8 o'clock in the evening

653
00:26:16,860 --> 00:26:19,559
and let's be very honest build up

654
00:26:19,559 --> 00:26:21,360
is stressful I haven't made a day less

655
00:26:21,360 --> 00:26:23,159
than 12 or 14 hours during

656
00:26:23,159 --> 00:26:25,559
build up It's hard work so also at 8

657
00:26:25,559 --> 00:26:26,760
o'clock  Things are still being done in the evening

658
00:26:26,760 --> 00:26:29,400
and then you don't feel like

659
00:26:29,400 --> 00:26:30,900
waiting for the live stream vault So these

660
00:26:30,900 --> 00:26:34,080
are two men who had a job on a cherry picker

661
00:26:34,080 --> 00:26:36,960
at the entrance so what do

662
00:26:36,960 --> 00:26:39,480
you do they just drive over the train

663
00:26:39,480 --> 00:26:41,940
because they are  busy with work the man in the

664
00:26:41,940 --> 00:26:44,400
gikame had seen it and so he had one

665
00:26:44,400 --> 00:26:47,279
camera on stage and one camera

666
00:26:47,279 --> 00:26:49,740
looking at the stage he saw and should

667
00:26:49,740 --> 00:26:51,179
come because his rigi room had those

668
00:26:51,179 --> 00:26:53,760
palmas and so he has that live stream

669
00:26:53,760 --> 00:26:56,159
in the  gikamenge put that he

670
00:26:56,159 --> 00:26:58,980
truck has been driven through the image from the left to the right

671
00:26:58,980 --> 00:27:02,520
timing is evely so I took

672
00:27:02,520 --> 00:27:03,539
a picture here of my screen

673
00:27:03,539 --> 00:27:04,980
in the group

674
00:27:04,980 --> 00:27:08,000
threw you guys made it to the live stream

675
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:11,220
that was hilarious anyway especially if

676
00:27:11,220 --> 00:27:12,960
you like the comments from aanslavest that is

677
00:27:12,960 --> 00:27:14,700
just among other things is there also wi-fi on

678
00:27:14,700 --> 00:27:16,919
calservest No dude there has never been wi-fi

679
00:27:16,919 --> 00:27:21,559
three at 8 years wanted WIFI on calservest

680
00:27:26,700 --> 00:27:30,299
Sometimes you need more force was

681
00:27:30,299 --> 00:27:32,279
tell me all the field box is public

682
00:27:32,279 --> 00:27:33,659
so I could build my fiber optic transist

683
00:27:33,659 --> 00:27:37,500
this  clamped What was I thinking

684
00:27:37,500 --> 00:27:38,880
Black Well if you look closely here you will see

685
00:27:38,880 --> 00:27:41,720
that this whole man was not opened

686
00:27:41,720 --> 00:27:45,799
but I did get it open

687
00:27:47,039 --> 00:27:51,659
and sometimes you have too much force

688
00:27:51,659 --> 00:27:54,140
Fortunately this is not my connection cable

689
00:27:54,140 --> 00:27:56,820
but you did see a little more pain

690
00:27:56,820 --> 00:27:58,559
then that Terrible necessity that's what I mean

691
00:27:58,559 --> 00:27:59,880
and things like this are

692
00:27:59,880 --> 00:28:01,380
generally questions how difficulties in the

693
00:28:01,380 --> 00:28:02,760
field of dice shooting in the field

694
00:28:02,760 --> 00:28:05,400
of Hey Net did he still do it hot well

695
00:28:05,400 --> 00:28:06,960
not anymore Well that's because I

696
00:28:06,960 --> 00:28:08,640
seem to have looked at someone here but just a moment

697
00:28:08,640 --> 00:28:12,500
inside That's why he doesn't have to do it

698
00:28:13,740 --> 00:28:15,960
in advance now that we saw during the preparations

699
00:28:15,960 --> 00:28:17,220
I had cleaned all the equipment neatly

700
00:28:17,220 --> 00:28:19,620
that it would be a good idea to store it for a while

701
00:28:19,620 --> 00:28:20,880


702
00:28:20,880 --> 00:28:22,799
It's a bit difficult to

703
00:28:22,799 --> 00:28:25,320
see here It was gray because of the dust It was

704
00:28:25,320 --> 00:28:28,140
beautiful weather what has now  it

705
00:28:28,140 --> 00:28:29,580
rained and the equipment has

706
00:28:29,580 --> 00:28:32,039
been inside and got dusty I'll

707
00:28:32,039 --> 00:28:35,220
start again afterwards including telephone

708
00:28:35,220 --> 00:28:36,559
sanitizer

709
00:28:36,559 --> 00:28:40,020
bonus points for no idea quotes

710
00:28:40,020 --> 00:28:42,620


711
00:28:46,080 --> 00:28:50,159
sometimes nobody just has the fire with it well Sometimes

712
00:28:50,159 --> 00:28:51,659
it's optional

713
00:28:51,659 --> 00:28:53,820
in one of the containers that we

714
00:28:53,820 --> 00:28:55,140
got emptied got on  at one

715
00:28:55,140 --> 00:28:56,960
point a phone call

716
00:28:56,960 --> 00:28:59,880
and I just saw Rob

717
00:28:59,880 --> 00:29:03,860
and I can't reach so and so

718
00:29:04,500 --> 00:29:06,720
I then made a door call

719
00:29:06,720 --> 00:29:08,159
jumped on the bike and was there 2

720
00:29:08,159 --> 00:29:12,779
minutes later There were 8 emergency response personnel with 2

721
00:29:12,779 --> 00:29:14,820
extinguishers

722
00:29:14,820 --> 00:29:17,179
It was a neat response start and

723
00:29:17,179 --> 00:29:19,440
in the end this turned out to be the culprit

724
00:29:19,440 --> 00:29:20,940


725
00:29:20,940 --> 00:29:22,860
It wasn't quite invoked for

726
00:29:22,860 --> 00:29:24,500
his protocol but the effect was

727
00:29:24,500 --> 00:29:27,960
definitely there so sometimes fourth just be

728
00:29:27,960 --> 00:29:30,899
sometimes it's fun what you

729
00:29:30,899 --> 00:29:32,820
see here on the right I won't take too many

730
00:29:32,820 --> 00:29:34,980
names take your shame and don't need him

731
00:29:34,980 --> 00:29:36,960
This is  a flamethrower it was part of

732
00:29:36,960 --> 00:29:39,240
one of the Act the pictures taken on a

733
00:29:39,240 --> 00:29:41,880
Sunday morning before opening times and you

734
00:29:41,880 --> 00:29:43,200
see some of the

735
00:29:43,200 --> 00:29:46,740
organizers standing with sausages

736
00:29:46,740 --> 00:29:48,899
sometimes it's not obligatory sometimes

737
00:29:48,899 --> 00:29:51,439
it's optional

738
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:57,500
the last addition is

739
00:29:57,539 --> 00:29:59,460
make sure you have fun  on that work

740
00:29:59,460 --> 00:30:01,679
have pride in your work

741
00:30:01,679 --> 00:30:04,620
support the right Goals

742
00:30:04,620 --> 00:30:07,080
Sometimes you have to be a little creative we

743
00:30:07,080 --> 00:30:08,640
need an earthper We have nothing left Yes

744
00:30:08,640 --> 00:30:09,779
those greengrocers don't need the rest of the

745
00:30:09,779 --> 00:30:12,600
event anymore

746
00:30:12,600 --> 00:30:14,460
well you have to roll your cables on people

747
00:30:14,460 --> 00:30:16,020
that  now i see someone

748
00:30:16,020 --> 00:30:17,580
doing this with my cables i'm not standing for

749
00:30:17,580 --> 00:30:19,919
myself in cable should be neat on large

750
00:30:19,919 --> 00:30:22,380
if you still want to use it and

751
00:30:22,380 --> 00:30:26,299
of course support kibble management

752
00:30:30,779 --> 00:30:34,080
you are part of a team

753
00:30:34,080 --> 00:30:36,240
that team that team photo i just

754
00:30:36,240 --> 00:30:37,740
showed that not for nothing that is a

755
00:30:37,740 --> 00:30:40,260
pretty good free bond that has been

756
00:30:40,260 --> 00:30:42,179
coming back for years but we are not

757
00:30:42,179 --> 00:30:44,399
the only Team We depend on

758
00:30:44,399 --> 00:30:46,980
many other teams a good example is

759
00:30:46,980 --> 00:30:49,679
always the internal catering team We

760
00:30:49,679 --> 00:30:51,419
arrange that their to portu works well  and

761
00:30:51,419 --> 00:30:53,039
they provide great food for

762
00:30:53,039 --> 00:30:55,740
us It's a trade off

763
00:30:55,740 --> 00:30:57,360
but I'm the part of the team

764
00:30:57,360 --> 00:30:58,919
Collaboration inside the team and

765
00:30:58,919 --> 00:31:02,179
outside the Team just gets to

766
00:31:05,100 --> 00:31:09,120
and if there's already looking at everything and it's

767
00:31:09,120 --> 00:31:10,679
wrong otherwise

768
00:31:10,679 --> 00:31:13,940
it's probably DNS

769
00:31:15,659 --> 00:31:18,659
I have  I have no idea how angry I am but

770
00:31:18,659 --> 00:31:20,460
this is the end

771
00:31:20,460 --> 00:31:22,860
of this beginning of Saturday morning from

772
00:31:22,860 --> 00:31:25,320
Heike hotel busy presentation there are

773
00:31:25,320 --> 00:31:26,190
questions

774
00:31:26,190 --> 00:31:29,640
[Applause]

775
00:31:29,640 --> 00:31:31,260
I have a little idea totally what

776
00:31:31,260 --> 00:31:34,520
greenhouse bottle scissors are for the

777
00:31:41,220 --> 00:31:43,080
I have also given this once before

778
00:31:43,080 --> 00:31:45,539
on RTL now  and eh especially the Messi

779
00:31:45,539 --> 00:31:47,100
organize things like this that say Yes

780
00:31:47,100 --> 00:31:48,899
indeed This is just the same everywhere

781
00:31:48,899 --> 00:31:51,439
It is recognizable

782
00:31:55,039 --> 00:31:57,960
20 years just engineer again and then more

783
00:31:57,960 --> 00:32:01,860
to the sizes of all three outlines about

784
00:32:01,860 --> 00:32:03,960
application

785
00:32:03,960 --> 00:32:06,320
is correct

786
00:32:07,919 --> 00:32:10,620
I've

787
00:32:10,620 --> 00:32:13,440
been on the road for a while industry

788
00:32:13,440 --> 00:32:15,539
that What  things were around free players

789
00:32:15,539 --> 00:32:17,640
records to read connections will

790
00:32:17,640 --> 00:32:19,679
use something with you wax or is that

791
00:32:19,679 --> 00:32:21,840
in your ears never participated actually

792
00:32:21,840 --> 00:32:24,059
my usually on our own glass out and the

793
00:32:24,059 --> 00:32:25,679
optician in it is all Singer

794
00:32:25,679 --> 00:32:28,740
for the glass is eh yes kept it in a

795
00:32:28,740 --> 00:32:31,580
Switch and then you have what

796
00:32:32,580 --> 00:32:35,299
I don't know yeah

797
00:32:38,060 --> 00:32:45,779
[Music]

798
00:32:50,480 --> 00:32:53,580
the design we're running here is a uh

799
00:32:53,580 --> 00:32:55,260
successor to the network of the year the

800
00:32:55,260 --> 00:32:56,640
forward of the network before that

801
00:32:56,640 --> 00:32:57,840
or we built a good

802
00:32:57,840 --> 00:32:59,279
network once And we're making small

803
00:32:59,279 --> 00:33:01,679
improvements there  so and in this kind of

804
00:33:01,679 --> 00:33:02,659
thing might have great fun

805
00:33:02,659 --> 00:33:05,159
for that technical settings but even

806
00:33:05,159 --> 00:33:07,200
here a fence hotel I see eh clothespin

807
00:33:07,200 --> 00:33:09,980
this P not happening

808
00:33:20,179 --> 00:33:23,580
Yes the winter edition of Kasvest I

809
00:33:23,580 --> 00:33:25,140
also lend out some equipment and cat

810
00:33:25,140 --> 00:33:26,940
I also send eh here in the Netherlands what  working less

811
00:33:26,940 --> 00:33:28,440


812
00:33:28,440 --> 00:33:29,760
so I'll do that for quite a while

813
00:33:29,760 --> 00:33:31,740
I'm a volunteer in Kasvesteen so

814
00:33:31,740 --> 00:33:33,179
I eh I don't know the terrain

815
00:33:33,179 --> 00:33:36,620
people can and I also know the networking

816
00:33:37,919 --> 00:33:39,840
Well we're going it in the context of Rijt

817
00:33:39,840 --> 00:33:41,340
I also want to thank you very much for

818
00:33:41,340 --> 00:33:43,019
