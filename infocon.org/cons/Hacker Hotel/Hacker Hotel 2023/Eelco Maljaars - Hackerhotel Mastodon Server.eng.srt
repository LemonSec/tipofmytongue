31
00:01:15,299 --> 00:01:18,600
a bit of my background

32
00:01:18,600 --> 00:01:21,500
it's me about

33
00:01:21,500 --> 00:01:25,220
macedon server hotel

34
00:01:25,220 --> 00:01:27,920
public specifically married to mastodon

35
00:01:27,920 --> 00:01:30,920
Good morning

36
00:01:31,170 --> 00:01:34,520
[Music]

37
00:01:34,520 --> 00:01:36,780
the landscape where it is in  fits eh

38
00:01:36,780 --> 00:01:40,920
macedon eh is an imperimentation eh for

39
00:01:40,920 --> 00:01:43,320
a social media server that supports Activity pub

40
00:01:43,320 --> 00:01:45,420
uh and that's pretty much what it's about

41
00:01:45,420 --> 00:01:46,920
from me an open standard

42
00:01:46,920 --> 00:01:49,799
that anyone can import eh it's

43
00:01:49,799 --> 00:01:50,579
kind of it goes back a little bit

44
00:01:50,579 --> 00:01:52,680
to the time of the  As far as I'm concerned I

45
00:01:52,680 --> 00:01:54,960
just see the comparison with s MTB

46
00:01:54,960 --> 00:01:56,700
the mail protocol where you

47
00:01:56,700 --> 00:01:58,979
can run your own mail server here and miss your messages

48
00:01:58,979 --> 00:02:00,540
well that's what

49
00:02:00,540 --> 00:02:03,600
mastodon does for social media eh but that

50
00:02:03,600 --> 00:02:04,979
's a lot all my other grilled cheese sandwiches

51
00:02:04,979 --> 00:02:07,200
do too  and that it might be

52
00:02:07,200 --> 00:02:09,660
better loose for you specific usefree

53
00:02:09,660 --> 00:02:13,200
do better um so you also have something like that eh

54
00:02:13,200 --> 00:02:15,480
pleiroma and you have eh pixel fat what

55
00:02:15,480 --> 00:02:17,459
says more focus on eh sharing of images

56
00:02:17,459 --> 00:02:20,340
you have eh tube because that focuses on

57
00:02:20,340 --> 00:02:24,239
sharing yourself  eh video eh and the idea

58
00:02:24,239 --> 00:02:25,739
of ​​the say eh that you can do it yourself

59
00:02:25,739 --> 00:02:28,319
eh eh and you don't necessarily have to have

60
00:02:28,319 --> 00:02:29,879
the same head but you can

61
00:02:29,879 --> 00:02:31,140
ask Ivo anyone to raise it for

62
00:02:31,140 --> 00:02:33,959
you um and I think that

63
00:02:33,959 --> 00:02:35,840
's important of itself  look at your

64
00:02:35,840 --> 00:02:37,980
home just say what you need in

65
00:02:37,980 --> 00:02:40,200
terms of privacy or autonomy eh

66
00:02:40,200 --> 00:02:41,819
so that's nice if you're not say

67
00:02:41,819 --> 00:02:43,440
rank of a very large party

68
00:02:43,440 --> 00:02:45,599
that name is your switch on or

69
00:02:45,599 --> 00:02:47,160
can turn it on but that you just

70
00:02:47,160 --> 00:02:49,440
control yourself  are about whether you can say

71
00:02:49,440 --> 00:02:51,599
or not

72
00:02:51,599 --> 00:02:54,440
ehm so I am very happy with this

73
00:02:54,440 --> 00:02:56,840
development This is a

74
00:02:56,840 --> 00:03:00,019
very bad

75
00:03:00,319 --> 00:03:04,739
would see that is a pity ehm Anyway we

76
00:03:04,739 --> 00:03:06,840
are in Chantal van tools so see that

77
00:03:06,840 --> 00:03:08,640
pup protocol install eh and

78
00:03:08,640 --> 00:03:11,400
then if you so  you have a Toll eh

79
00:03:11,400 --> 00:03:15,060
you can also choose eh eh rich ga

80
00:03:15,060 --> 00:03:17,159
kering of eh program to

81
00:03:17,159 --> 00:03:19,319
talk to those tools so you have the maston

82
00:03:19,319 --> 00:03:21,480
server folder phone I am still choosing

83
00:03:21,480 --> 00:03:23,000
which app you use to talk to that

84
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:26,220
maston server  or with that has

85
00:03:26,220 --> 00:03:28,080
me really completely free It's all

86
00:03:28,080 --> 00:03:30,659
because active that pup is um there's just

87
00:03:30,659 --> 00:03:33,120
an openbi so I'd avoid that free

88
00:03:33,120 --> 00:03:35,340
to um yesterday request came from Oh I have

89
00:03:35,340 --> 00:03:37,140
a telex that for whom the Twitter API

90
00:03:37,140 --> 00:03:38,760
went Can't you guys have a  maston

91
00:03:38,760 --> 00:03:40,560
knots Well that seems to me that seems like

92
00:03:40,560 --> 00:03:43,680
apple huh that's eh there it is And that's what

93
00:03:43,680 --> 00:03:45,180
makes it that's why I thought it's

94
00:03:45,180 --> 00:03:46,860
very interesting for this community

95
00:03:46,860 --> 00:03:49,560
eh because it's just very open

96
00:03:49,560 --> 00:03:51,540
everyone can do whatever you want

97
00:03:51,540 --> 00:03:53,640
eh eh but  on the other hand you are also

98
00:03:53,640 --> 00:03:55,200
very much in control of what you

99
00:03:55,200 --> 00:03:57,799
get to see and then I will come back to it later eh

100
00:03:57,799 --> 00:04:00,840
some more I still have to go

101
00:04:00,840 --> 00:04:02,519

102
00:04:02,519 --> 00:04:04,319
because I will always have them last year I am

103

tucked in that was still in nl

104
00:04:06,720 --> 00:04:09,799
ehm but yes eh then it suddenly became eh

105
00:04:09,799 --> 00:04:12,780
November 22 I don't know what exactly

106
00:04:12,780 --> 00:04:14,099
where it is but these are graphs

107
00:04:14,099 --> 00:04:16,139
from eh from last year of the number of

108
00:04:16,139 --> 00:04:18,540

00:06:23,759 --> 00:06:26,160
also see that there is a lot of eh eh

167
00:06:26,160 --> 00:06:27,840
development still there huh  is being

168
00:06:27,840 --> 00:06:29,280
programmed a lot a lot of

169
00:06:29,280 --> 00:06:32,220
people are busy adjusting their tools so eh

171
00:06:35,220 --> 00:06:37,520
I also notice the eh well

172
00:06:37,520 --> 00:06:39,840
we sometimes talk to people like dude

173
00:06:39,840 --> 00:06:42,060
eh so I also notice the  applications

174
00:06:42,060 --> 00:06:43,759
not that I letter

175
00:06:43,759 --> 00:06:46,080
but my question how does that work an

176
00:06:46,080 --> 00:06:47,880
Oh that is always our organization What

177
00:06:47,880 --> 00:06:49,560
are its look I really want more and more

178
00:06:49,560 --> 00:06:50,759
organization think Okay but maybe

179
00:06:50,759 --> 00:06:53,400
we should try it anyway and

180
00:06:53,400 --> 00:06:55,880
it is eh

181
00:06:56,220 --> 00:06:58,500
so yes that was  just say hey the name

182
00:06:58,500 --> 00:07:00,180
is not known and that is now eh a matter

183
00:07:00,180 --> 00:07:01,500
of well see what we

184
00:07:01,500 --> 00:07:03,919
can all do then

185
00:07:05,039 --> 00:07:07,139
eh yes I don't know if you have

186
00:07:07,139 --> 00:07:08,759
ever used or is it eh from those eh

187
00:07:08,759 --> 00:07:10,740
see  here and there some here what is

188
00:07:10,740 --> 00:07:12,240
n't because I'm trying well I'll

189
00:07:12,240 --> 00:07:14,160
just show you something now eh what it

190
00:07:14,160 --> 00:07:18,199
looks like And eh what you can do with it

191
00:07:18,360 --> 00:07:21,500
I have to see because

192
00:07:25,139 --> 00:07:29,479
These are not This is me

193
00:07:31,740 --> 00:07:33,300
If they want him here

194
00:07:33,300 --> 00:07:35,880
indeed had a look to see if I should be

195
00:07:35,880 --> 00:07:39,060
away from my screen for a while ah look this is going to

196
00:07:39,060 --> 00:07:40,680
be really super handy I should have

197
00:07:40,680 --> 00:07:41,699
maybe just

198
00:07:41,699 --> 00:07:44,240
put duplicate but well

199
00:07:44,280 --> 00:07:47,160
ehm let's have a look masteron.nl I just

200
00:07:47,160 --> 00:07:49,400
created a few esteccount ehm

201
00:07:49,400 --> 00:07:53,039
or just the demonstration ehm

202
00:07:53,039 --> 00:07:55,139
most important with Macedonia you have about 3

203
00:07:55,139 --> 00:07:58,199
timelines ehm you have eh your home

204
00:07:58,199 --> 00:07:59,880
timeline that's what the people you

205
00:07:59,880 --> 00:08:04,560
really follow say that's what I say you do

206
00:08:04,560 --> 00:08:07,500
n't care just take a look just

207
00:08:07,500 --> 00:08:09,240
grab it

208
00:08:09,240 --> 00:08:12,660
Yes you do have your home Time Line local

209
00:08:12,660 --> 00:08:13,800
time Line and  those are all people

210
00:08:13,800 --> 00:08:16,319
who are on your server and you got me

211
00:08:16,319 --> 00:08:17,580
further with the timeline that means those are

212
00:08:17,580 --> 00:08:19,860
messages that

213
00:08:19,860 --> 00:08:22,379
go back and forth all over the federers and that's why it's

214
00:08:22,379 --> 00:08:24,060
nice to think about it

215
00:08:24,060 --> 00:08:25,620
in terms of I have a  own server

216
00:08:25,620 --> 00:08:28,080
for my little club because eh if you

217
00:08:28,080 --> 00:08:29,699
all choose to sit on such a server

218
00:08:29,699 --> 00:08:30,599
and then you have them on your

219
00:08:30,599 --> 00:08:33,240
hometime glue all your eh All the people of

220
00:08:33,240 --> 00:08:34,799
the swimming club are all in

221
00:08:34,799 --> 00:08:36,839
their timeline you can talk to each other  easier

222
00:08:36,839 --> 00:08:38,820
to find but it is not necessary Of course you can

223
00:08:38,820 --> 00:08:40,740
just have contact with

224
00:08:40,740 --> 00:08:43,159
who and also

225
00:08:44,940 --> 00:08:47,959
Shall we just here the

226
00:08:53,720 --> 00:08:55,560
people who are on that

227
00:08:55,560 --> 00:08:57,600
server and then you would also see would

228
00:08:57,600 --> 00:08:59,459
you see this is mastodon.nl so then you see

229
00:08:59,459 --> 00:09:00,899
suddenly completely Dutch

230
00:09:00,899 --> 00:09:03,000
messages eh you also see the people there

231
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:04,380
making things because someone has

232
00:09:04,380 --> 00:09:07,200
apparently made something eh we say

233
00:09:07,200 --> 00:09:08,000
Well eh

234
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:11,160
This is now being played on Radio 2 Well

235
00:09:11,160 --> 00:09:12,959
I like that someone made but

236
00:09:12,959 --> 00:09:14,360
I don't think so  interesting

237
00:09:14,360 --> 00:09:16,560
musician very easy eh paint yourself like well

238
00:09:16,560 --> 00:09:18,859
eh

239
00:09:29,839 --> 00:09:32,220
or I want to use those blocks because I

240
00:09:32,220 --> 00:09:33,480
just don't want to have an attract at all And

241
00:09:33,480 --> 00:09:34,980
I like that a bit

242
00:09:34,980 --> 00:09:36,420
better with mastverdonder there are many

243
00:09:36,420 --> 00:09:39,060
more controls in it to give you the

244
00:09:39,060 --> 00:09:40,560
tools, say, a certain  finger sees or

245
00:09:40,560 --> 00:09:42,300
doesn't see a nice concert what's in it

246
00:09:42,300 --> 00:09:44,279
is his content morning so if you have

247
00:09:44,279 --> 00:09:45,839
a picture record maybe I know

248
00:09:45,839 --> 00:09:48,540
a little huh Porn you name it Yes

249
00:09:48,540 --> 00:09:49,800
but or it can also be a little less has

250
00:09:49,800 --> 00:09:52,620
no eh something less explicit eh there can

251
00:09:52,620 --> 00:09:53,880
you say Well the comment worm so that

252
00:09:53,880 --> 00:09:55,500
picture probably won't come right away

253
00:09:55,500 --> 00:09:57,959
she's getting old Well you think

254
00:09:57,959 --> 00:09:59,160
you have to click through to

255
00:09:59,160 --> 00:10:02,279
see it eh we are there thinks well eh I do

256
00:10:02,279 --> 00:10:04,260
n't know so scared So eh you can go into

257
00:10:04,260 --> 00:10:05,760
the  used is just saying Well doesn't matter

258
00:10:05,760 --> 00:10:07,860
anyway a comteboarding is on I

259
00:10:07,860 --> 00:10:09,480
just always want to see right away and we're

260
00:10:09,480 --> 00:10:12,540
already there eh option that just

261
00:10:12,540 --> 00:10:14,459
give you control over what

262
00:10:14,459 --> 00:10:16,320
happens eh in your timeline instead of

263
00:10:16,320 --> 00:10:19,440
a company  determined for you eh what is

264
00:10:19,440 --> 00:10:21,360
interesting for you some people

265
00:10:21,360 --> 00:10:22,740
also find it a disadvantage eh he says yes

266
00:10:22,740 --> 00:10:23,820
but I was actually used to Twitter then

267
00:10:23,820 --> 00:10:27,240
many people click on eh then eh

268
00:10:27,240 --> 00:10:29,459
eh then it will automatically reach me too

269
00:10:29,459 --> 00:10:31,500
eh I see it more  as a

270
00:10:31,500 --> 00:10:34,080
cyclist that I am more eh eh in control

271
00:10:34,080 --> 00:10:37,339
of what I don't get to see bubbles

272
00:10:40,860 --> 00:10:42,360
So they also have all kinds of

273
00:10:42,360 --> 00:10:44,519
torr head of yours here just really eh And but

274
00:10:44,519 --> 00:10:47,760
I was able to add that to those eh Profile settings

275
00:10:47,760 --> 00:10:49,460
eh

276
00:10:49,460 --> 00:10:51,600
[Music]

277
00:10:51,600 --> 00:10:55,040
you can really really well yes

278
00:10:57,380 --> 00:10:59,399
I could say that you don't

279
00:10:59,399 --> 00:11:01,440
want animated gist or you can say that

280
00:11:01,440 --> 00:11:03,660
well yes all kinds of use Britt those

281
00:11:03,660 --> 00:11:05,519
things there are pretty well

282
00:11:05,519 --> 00:11:06,360
given That's also the reason to start

283
00:11:06,360 --> 00:11:09,959
with mastodon now  gang am eh

284
00:11:09,959 --> 00:11:11,459
I have all those returns where this one I like this

285
00:11:11,459 --> 00:11:16,518
eh best so let's

286
00:11:19,019 --> 00:11:22,279
see if we can get this one again I think

287
00:11:34,740 --> 00:11:37,940
it's also shot back

288
00:11:44,220 --> 00:11:48,180
now so well you have multiple timelines You

289
00:11:48,180 --> 00:11:50,660
're very much in cash following I have

290
00:11:50,660 --> 00:11:53,399
today yesterday the  new fish from

291
00:11:53,399 --> 00:11:55,200
massem came out we also if you

292
00:11:55,200 --> 00:11:57,720
tag then follow that yes you can't

293
00:11:57,720 --> 00:11:59,279
say I follow that Tag I think you can

294
00:11:59,279 --> 00:12:01,140
find it are now in the latest

295
00:12:01,140 --> 00:12:02,399
version they have searched that you also

296
00:12:02,399 --> 00:12:03,720
have a list of oh this text

297
00:12:03,720 --> 00:12:04,680
I think that  you can just click on it

298
00:12:04,680 --> 00:12:06,180
so you also see that there is still a lot of

299
00:12:06,180 --> 00:12:09,000
movement in version 1.4.1 do

300
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:10,500
n't think it is relevant to anyone here, but

301
00:12:10,500 --> 00:12:12,180
Westfriesland is officially under a

302
00:12:12,180 --> 00:12:14,940
language, isn't it, so that really became eh yes

303
00:12:14,940 --> 00:12:16,920
well if you use Frisian  do you like that

304
00:12:16,920 --> 00:12:19,440
eh so that is really

305
00:12:19,440 --> 00:12:22,200
done something um yes what really works differently

306
00:12:22,200 --> 00:12:23,579
if you are used to Twitter or something

307
00:12:23,579 --> 00:12:24,899
So that Liking that is actually

308
00:12:24,899 --> 00:12:26,940
quite a signal from the person

309
00:12:26,940 --> 00:12:28,200
who wrote a message from I

310
00:12:28,200 --> 00:12:29,940
think this eh eh someone  where it has

311
00:12:29,940 --> 00:12:31,740
your message don't they have it so that eh

312
00:12:31,740 --> 00:12:33,240
if there are just enough eh enough

313
00:12:33,240 --> 00:12:36,120
click on that button and then it will be seen by more

314
00:12:36,120 --> 00:12:37,800
people or something huh that's eh

315
00:12:37,800 --> 00:12:40,740
there we have eh mastodon you have the

316
00:12:40,740 --> 00:12:42,360
boost before you say well  That's

317
00:12:42,360 --> 00:12:44,540
kind of

318
00:12:54,800 --> 00:12:57,839
[Music]

319
00:13:00,740 --> 00:13:03,839
this client doesn't handle this well enough

320
00:13:03,839 --> 00:13:05,279
for me I'll take the other one ready in

321
00:13:05,279 --> 00:13:07,019
it and that might be the option

322
00:13:07,019 --> 00:13:09,600
in there so that's uh you know really just

323
00:13:09,600 --> 00:13:11,639
the diversity real England increasing

324
00:13:11,639 --> 00:13:13,740
and uh

325
00:13:13,740 --> 00:13:15,720
oh  I just didn't mention that, but I

326
00:13:15,720 --> 00:13:17,339
can also be of messages from

327
00:13:17,339 --> 00:13:19,380
whether they are only for your followers

328
00:13:19,380 --> 00:13:22,680
or eh public or eh list I think that's

329
00:13:22,680 --> 00:13:24,060
a nicer one I sometimes have

330
00:13:24,060 --> 00:13:25,380
that you post it several times or

331
00:13:25,380 --> 00:13:26,459
a  each other or the self subject

332
00:13:26,459 --> 00:13:28,139
then I also say first a message is already

333
00:13:28,139 --> 00:13:29,940
an audience in the Sat And the other would

334
00:13:29,940 --> 00:13:31,740
me unlisted that is The one who

335
00:13:31,740 --> 00:13:33,720
is not interested in my messages

336
00:13:33,720 --> 00:13:34,800
he takes the first message to see

337
00:13:34,800 --> 00:13:37,380
not always gets more grounds too  hey

338
00:13:37,380 --> 00:13:39,060
And with the person who is signed click on

339
00:13:39,060 --> 00:13:41,760
that one message then Hey I'm

340
00:13:41,760 --> 00:13:43,139
completely concentrated so that does

341
00:13:43,139 --> 00:13:46,079
n't work better How was the because everything is with

342
00:13:46,079 --> 00:13:48,060
mastodon at all with activitype that's

343
00:13:48,060 --> 00:13:50,880
ehm you have to eh Even though you can

344
00:13:50,880 --> 00:13:53,100
set Well  here it sends It is some

345
00:13:53,100 --> 00:13:55,740
public information because eh eh

346
00:13:55,740 --> 00:13:57,959
restrictions Who it fires is in the

347
00:13:57,959 --> 00:13:59,940
protocol and so it is also up to the one

348
00:13:59,940 --> 00:14:01,500
you receive to respect that protocon

349
00:14:01,500 --> 00:14:04,079
eh so it is so she says

350
00:14:04,079 --> 00:14:06,480
I really care about private data  those

351
00:14:06,480 --> 00:14:07,980
sensitive things we would certainly

352
00:14:07,980 --> 00:14:09,660
not do via macedon then I would choose with a

353
00:14:09,660 --> 00:14:11,160
site and all

354
00:14:11,160 --> 00:14:13,260
ehm but yes it is actually meant to

355
00:14:13,260 --> 00:14:16,560
share information eh one complaint

356
00:14:16,560 --> 00:14:17,760
I still hear from people is that via

357
00:14:17,760 --> 00:14:19,620
that in Twitter we had  DM hey That was

358
00:14:19,620 --> 00:14:22,500
your private I don't know if it's really fine

359
00:14:22,500 --> 00:14:24,720
but you feel private eh

360
00:14:24,720 --> 00:14:26,519
they miss that and that yes I can't

361
00:14:26,519 --> 00:14:28,940
imagine that

362
00:14:36,660 --> 00:14:39,000
eh I don't try if there are any options

363
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:40,500
eh I would also suggest it if it  is

364
00:14:40,500 --> 00:14:41,880
not that someone wants to make you

365
00:14:41,880 --> 00:14:44,040
say that only post to the hometime

366
00:14:44,040 --> 00:14:46,860
Lines have yes um no I do

367
00:14:46,860 --> 00:14:49,940
n't really want to He is on visits

368
00:14:50,940 --> 00:14:54,660
so yes and this is what I think yes that just say

369
00:14:54,660 --> 00:14:56,040
something even better come what I do

370
00:14:56,040 --> 00:14:57,180
nice is that you then but that bee

371
00:14:57,180 --> 00:14:58,800
so not tied to an instant you can

372
00:14:58,800 --> 00:15:00,660
just send all your followers and signal

373
00:15:00,660 --> 00:15:03,180
from i moved to

374
00:15:03,180 --> 00:15:05,040
replace that they two staproces that says

375
00:15:05,040 --> 00:15:06,839
first on your new server from i'm from there

376
00:15:06,839 --> 00:15:08,940
huh that  is my parents and on

377
00:15:08,940 --> 00:15:10,680
the new server your [ __ ] says go there

378
00:15:10,680 --> 00:15:12,540
and I get all your followers a

379
00:15:12,540 --> 00:15:13,920
signal from hey you shouldn't

380
00:15:13,920 --> 00:15:15,019
follow this account

381
00:15:15,019 --> 00:15:17,160
that's also only what

382
00:15:17,160 --> 00:15:20,279
goes automatically because whoever you follow does

383
00:15:20,279 --> 00:15:21,480
n't take that.  not

384
00:15:21,480 --> 00:15:23,360
included so I think that's also eh

385
00:15:23,360 --> 00:15:26,880
we Pack where there is still improvement eh possible

386
00:15:26,880 --> 00:15:29,060


387
00:15:36,620 --> 00:15:39,540
for example that doesn't go along um and

388
00:15:39,540 --> 00:15:41,339
whoever you follow doesn't automatically go

389
00:15:41,339 --> 00:15:43,320
along either so you should What can you

390
00:15:43,320 --> 00:15:45,300
export here all your point that's your

391
00:15:45,300 --> 00:15:46,620
can already import sports so well

392
00:15:46,620 --> 00:15:50,760
only yes you have to do it and

393
00:15:51,300 --> 00:15:53,660
yes

394
00:16:00,300 --> 00:16:02,639
Well I think that in practice it would be

395
00:16:02,639 --> 00:16:04,079
work that in Port an export also works via the

396
00:16:04,079 --> 00:16:07,079
epi so that eh but on you if

397
00:16:07,079 --> 00:16:09,060
you can say with impunity from pReadero

398
00:16:09,060 --> 00:16:10,860
but you can  exporting and can embed in a massedon

399
00:16:10,860 --> 00:16:14,459
I think it's just a matter of time well eh

400
00:16:14,459 --> 00:16:18,120
first just testing I think um I think

401
00:16:18,120 --> 00:16:19,860
that should work anyway That is and

402
00:16:19,860 --> 00:16:21,060
also eh because I also have

403
00:16:21,060 --> 00:16:23,160
the internet on that eh Activity pub eh the

404
00:16:23,160 --> 00:16:25,380
standard is completely worked out  eh but

405
00:16:25,380 --> 00:16:27,480
things like and griptie eh so

406
00:16:27,480 --> 00:16:28,980
better learn about privacy that just

407
00:16:28,980 --> 00:16:30,300
stayed outside the standard because then

408
00:16:30,300 --> 00:16:31,139
they couldn't get over it I

409
00:16:31,139 --> 00:16:33,660
think it's a shame missed Calf but well

410
00:16:33,660 --> 00:16:34,339


411
00:16:34,339 --> 00:16:39,320
I Something I know that is eh yes

412
00:16:44,720 --> 00:16:47,820
Well as said eh

413
00:16:47,820 --> 00:16:48,839
being possible with dimitriocreal that's nice if they

414
00:16:48,839 --> 00:16:50,399
just start an Insta for crazy hotel

415
00:16:50,399 --> 00:16:52,560
and we'll see what happens

416
00:16:52,560 --> 00:16:55,019
it's a bit Everyone is welcome I

417
00:16:55,019 --> 00:16:58,040
eh had already put these here and there

418
00:16:58,040 --> 00:17:00,660
Total in the Rick Roll totally to the

419
00:17:00,660 --> 00:17:02,279
store  This is a this just leads you

420
00:17:02,279 --> 00:17:04,559
there in the invite page of the hotel on

421
00:17:04,559 --> 00:17:06,780
a social so that eh I'll

422
00:17:06,780 --> 00:17:07,919
check it up front that

423
00:17:07,919 --> 00:17:09,419
someone hasn't pasted over it from the

424
00:17:09,419 --> 00:17:14,299
know them here eh so that's eh yes no eh

425
00:17:14,599 --> 00:17:17,480
that eh that everyone I have the the

426
00:17:17,480 --> 00:17:21,240
rules huh a social space starts

427
00:17:21,240 --> 00:17:23,520
he becomes a rule needed to make eh some

428
00:17:23,520 --> 00:17:24,839
questions to each other I I have

429
00:17:24,839 --> 00:17:26,099
Inge Just literally copied the rules from

430
00:17:26,099 --> 00:17:29,040
mastodon.nl for now paste eh And

431
00:17:29,040 --> 00:17:31,020
I also have the  serverboard that's just

432
00:17:31,020 --> 00:17:32,700
something of a list of services that we do

433
00:17:32,700 --> 00:17:34,679
n't really want to talk to,

434
00:17:34,679 --> 00:17:36,179
I just put that together because I

435
00:17:36,179 --> 00:17:38,460
know that maston.nl is there Free eh eh

436
00:17:38,460 --> 00:17:40,380
careful all of a sudden in the sense to

437
00:17:40,380 --> 00:17:41,520
not just put those blocks in the first place

438
00:17:41,520 --> 00:17:43,740
really  crap came out

439
00:17:43,740 --> 00:17:46,860
so that's always just the start ehm well

440
00:17:46,860 --> 00:17:48,240
you can of course just say

441
00:17:48,240 --> 00:17:49,980
create Old now you can also think Well I'm just going to

442
00:17:49,980 --> 00:17:51,240


443
00:17:51,240 --> 00:17:52,500
follow the people who are on this or I'm just going to keep an eye on that Instinct a

444
00:17:52,500 --> 00:17:53,460
bit for that

445
00:17:53,460 --> 00:17:55,860
hometime  Line hey eh to see if anything

446
00:17:55,860 --> 00:17:57,299

447
00:17:57,299 --> 00:18:00,600
eh yeah that doesn't matter that's eh

448
00:18:00,600 --> 00:18:05,418
I wouldn't be either dude eh

449
00:18:05,520 --> 00:18:07,200
I've already said well eh I'll just do this for

450
00:18:07,200 --> 00:18:08,280
a year and then in another

451
00:18:08,280 --> 00:18:09,600
years and then we just talk

452
00:18:09,600 --> 00:18:11,640
about eh always see along the way and

453
00:18:11,640 --> 00:18:14,039
make a separate commitment or eh have you

454
00:18:14,039 --> 00:18:15,900
boarded maston maston maston

455
00:18:15,900 --> 00:18:18,179
other Verdi verchair eh And then

456
00:18:18,179 --> 00:18:20,419
we have found each other eh yes

457
00:18:20,419 --> 00:18:22,679
extras is for eh it's just handy

458
00:18:22,679 --> 00:18:24,240
lose then we keep him there and if

459
00:18:24,240 --> 00:18:26,340
they say Well you're nice too but he's

460
00:18:26,340 --> 00:18:27,720
collecting a bit of dust just as

461
00:18:27,720 --> 00:18:30,240
good friends then no eh I

462
00:18:30,240 --> 00:18:31,260
just hope everyone thinks Well that

463
00:18:31,260 --> 00:18:32,880
eh that eh let's take a look at

464
00:18:32,880 --> 00:18:35,340
this  I talked about eh that eh

465
00:18:35,340 --> 00:18:36,780
fence that I just comped the rules for now

466
00:18:36,780 --> 00:18:39,299
But yes I now see myself

467
00:18:39,299 --> 00:18:41,220
as the technology manager if

468
00:18:41,220 --> 00:18:43,380
people have that idea then eh then

469
00:18:43,380 --> 00:18:45,900
it will be happy to go moderation if of course

470
00:18:45,900 --> 00:18:47,100
it really doesn't go anywhere  articles,

471
00:18:47,100 --> 00:18:48,840
then of course we

472
00:18:48,840 --> 00:18:50,820
also have to create an account once in a while

473
00:18:50,820 --> 00:18:53,100
I don't know

474
00:18:53,100 --> 00:18:54,360
if this is completely within the rules

475
00:18:54,360 --> 00:18:56,160
so then you have to do that, that's

476
00:18:56,160 --> 00:18:57,720
what I've learned and that whole thing of

477
00:18:57,720 --> 00:19:00,120
luck  about eh and well story that seems

478
00:19:00,120 --> 00:19:01,260
where most of the work goes is

479
00:19:01,260 --> 00:19:03,000
moderation and that is actually always eh

480
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:05,820
on a knet eh that eh Sherry

481
00:19:05,820 --> 00:19:08,520
is going to be eh, but then make sure that

482
00:19:08,520 --> 00:19:10,440
eh eh all have a little reserve with

483
00:19:10,440 --> 00:19:12,360
everyone and according to the rules  hey the

484
00:19:12,360 --> 00:19:13,440
new one with each other Except agreed

485
00:19:13,440 --> 00:19:15,419
that that just someone has to put in time

486
00:19:15,419 --> 00:19:17,539


487
00:19:17,940 --> 00:19:19,980
and so I have it for now I see invite

488
00:19:19,980 --> 00:19:21,960
only eh but yes of course like you

489
00:19:21,960 --> 00:19:22,980
have an account you can also

490
00:19:22,980 --> 00:19:25,919
create an invite for someone else so it's eh and

491
00:19:25,919 --> 00:19:28,400
still  that the most sensible eh

492
00:19:28,400 --> 00:19:32,100
solution is eh I don't know eh I do

493
00:19:32,100 --> 00:19:33,419
n't know how old am I this one I have such a QR

494
00:19:33,419 --> 00:19:36,720
code is also everywhere eh so not no

495
00:19:36,720 --> 00:19:38,700
problem eh we can just

496
00:19:38,700 --> 00:19:41,039
catch up a bit myself I think

497
00:19:41,039 --> 00:19:43,260
Yes  I eh I don't know if they want to

498
00:19:43,260 --> 00:19:45,240
see I can say eh the test version

499
00:19:45,240 --> 00:19:47,760
of eh mosterdon eh live folds I

500
00:19:47,760 --> 00:19:49,440
first thought I'm going to lead the real way those

501
00:19:49,440 --> 00:19:51,600
folds but I'm once it went I

502
00:19:51,600 --> 00:19:53,880
thought demofact would just put it in  so

503
00:19:53,880 --> 00:19:56,460
sit down the road eh But I do have

504
00:19:56,460 --> 00:19:57,720
a test version you can

505
00:19:57,720 --> 00:19:59,460
see how long it takes to roll out that eh with

506
00:19:59,460 --> 00:20:01,860
cubienet on an eh a single

507
00:20:01,860 --> 00:20:04,080


508
00:20:04,080 --> 00:20:06,380
and I don't know

509
00:20:06,380 --> 00:20:09,179
that is in any case but eh  should I

510
00:20:09,179 --> 00:20:10,980

trusted yet  with all the

526
00:21:02,580 --> 00:21:05,520
shortcuts so I can read it like this to

527

539
00:21:50,880 --> 00:21:53,100
Make a new one take Space on my

540
00:21:53,100 --> 00:21:55,320
test server

541
00:21:55,320 --> 00:21:58,799
and then I can be here if it's ok

542
00:21:58,799 --> 00:22:01,460
but look at it

543
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:07,679
and that's a bit of it but that

544
00:22:07,679 --> 00:22:09,780
masodon isn't it, that's just a tool to do

545
00:22:09,780 --> 00:22:11,820
this with  do and just a disadvantages of

546
00:22:11,820 --> 00:22:13,200
massadon You would also see there is eh

547
00:22:13,200 --> 00:22:14,460
that I actually find it a bit

548
00:22:14,460 --> 00:22:16,799
complicated for what it is hey that is quite a bit of

549
00:22:16,799 --> 00:22:19,200
permission for the for

550
00:22:19,200 --> 00:22:21,299
the technical document it is eh eh

551
00:22:21,299 --> 00:22:24,480

553
00:22:27,480 --> 00:22:30,600

554
00:22:30,600 --> 00:22:33,240
that with a helmet horse eh eh

555
00:22:33,240 --> 00:22:35,240
Cuba is getting neters now the

556
00:22:35,240 --> 00:22:39,900
test festival eh mastodon anyway eh René

557
00:22:39,900 --> 00:22:42,059
fences hotel with Anyways

558
00:22:42,059 --> 00:22:44,039
test point fences hotel point Well it

559
00:22:44,039 --> 00:22:46,100
takes eh  minutes or 2 2.5 before he is eh eh

560
00:22:46,100 --> 00:22:49,679
eh eh Trade I've also seen

561
00:22:49,679 --> 00:22:51,840
that he's right eh at least with the

562
00:22:51,840 --> 00:22:52,919
power, of course I

563
00:22:52,919 --> 00:22:54,480
tried to lap it right

564
00:22:54,480 --> 00:22:56,340
into the red of oh superiew Overload Well

565
00:22:56,340 --> 00:22:57,840
that's  eh

566
00:22:57,840 --> 00:22:59,580
another straight point to take a

567
00:22:59,580 --> 00:23:01,260
look at yeah no yeah that doesn't matter that's

568
00:23:01,260 --> 00:23:02,820
eh

569
00:23:02,820 --> 00:23:06,419
every Here's that even quit level so I

570
00:23:06,419 --> 00:23:08,940
thought oh eh we're just

571
00:23:08,940 --> 00:23:10,380
starting up just thought we'd do this fitney

572
00:23:10,380 --> 00:23:14,220
say cons that Ruby  with Ruby on

573
00:23:14,220 --> 00:23:16,799
Ribs It's quite a bit heavy

574
00:23:16,799 --> 00:23:19,140
so that's eh eh from mussels on the bang

575
00:23:19,140 --> 00:23:21,539
have that heap of iron opposite so

576
00:23:21,539 --> 00:23:23,460
it runs like a charm but if

577
00:23:23,460 --> 00:23:25,980
you say well that's Hè Can the swimsuits

578
00:23:25,980 --> 00:23:27,539
on the corner have their own mass

579
00:23:27,539 --> 00:23:29,460
running the receipt that well then we still have

580
00:23:29,460 --> 00:23:31,980
some work to do I think so eh but I

581
00:23:31,980 --> 00:23:33,240
think it's a good idea if

582
00:23:33,240 --> 00:23:36,860
more people can do it themselves eh Well

583
00:23:39,740 --> 00:23:41,700
yes that is also that is of course very

584
00:23:41,700 --> 00:23:43,080
much How many users  indeed

585
00:23:43,080 --> 00:23:44,820
sit down to work This one is of course

586
00:23:44,820 --> 00:23:48,799
almost empty so then

587
00:23:49,400 --> 00:23:52,520
How heavy

588
00:23:55,340 --> 00:23:57,539
hoping in the air just because of that 10

589
00:23:57,539 --> 00:24:00,780
20 user service

590
00:24:06,960 --> 00:24:08,179
just a little

591
00:24:08,179 --> 00:24:10,320
If I say now to say we

592
00:24:10,320 --> 00:24:12,299
're going to roll out the base helmthout we're lucky

593
00:24:12,299 --> 00:24:13,919
I'm saying worry  that you have 20 G

594
00:24:13,919 --> 00:24:16,080


595
00:24:16,080 --> 00:24:18,539
eh Yes No but that makes then yes but that

596
00:24:18,539 --> 00:24:22,340
is say eh what

597
00:24:24,720 --> 00:24:26,520
Yes and then you actually have it then

598
00:24:26,520 --> 00:24:27,900
you have the clearly dressed version

599
00:24:27,900 --> 00:24:31,520
so I still think that eh yes

600
00:24:33,740 --> 00:24:35,880
I'm still waiting for a while  wait for Max to

601
00:24:35,880 --> 00:24:37,980
do also have a green to

602
00:24:37,980 --> 00:24:39,299
show because then maybe we

603
00:24:39,299 --> 00:24:42,120
really can't see and web Brouwer

604
00:24:42,120 --> 00:24:44,039
I have nothing to do then you can

605
00:24:44,039 --> 00:24:46,080
undress but that I don't

606
00:24:46,080 --> 00:24:49,399
serve him that much Well that

607
00:24:57,360 --> 00:25:00,500
Oh  look uh ca

608
00:25:00,840 --> 00:25:03,120
n't see what i'm doing but

609
00:25:03,120 --> 00:25:05,959
i'm going with five

610
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:13,140
minutes to roll it all the way out

611
00:25:13,140 --> 00:25:14,720
but i still see you a uh

612
00:25:14,720 --> 00:25:18,140
mastodon webc which isn't

613
00:25:23,059 --> 00:25:26,720
i think

614
00:25:29,400 --> 00:25:32,539
i'm just going to go all

615
00:25:36,260 --> 00:25:38,299
the machine

616
00:25:38,299 --> 00:25:40,140
but that grapes for other things too

617
00:25:40,140 --> 00:25:42,559
on so

618
00:25:43,740 --> 00:25:45,120
I don't know how to say I don't

619
00:25:45,120 --> 00:25:47,360
really know Maybe

620
00:25:47,360 --> 00:25:49,860
the name specs are going to limit so just say

621
00:25:49,860 --> 00:25:51,360
that the one that wears out of

622
00:25:51,360 --> 00:25:54,000
that server is reserved or eh I just

623
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:55,380
thought that was very naive I

624
00:25:55,380 --> 00:25:56,760
just do  I check this link and

625
00:25:56,760 --> 00:25:58,700
then eh see something but

626
00:25:58,700 --> 00:26:01,559
it's on my eh

627
00:26:01,559 --> 00:26:05,520
yes look at my screen here

628
00:26:05,520 --> 00:26:08,600
but it's not for you

629
00:26:10,020 --> 00:26:12,419
so eh well well you can now see here

630
00:26:12,419 --> 00:26:14,340
at test point fences from eh then

631
00:26:14,340 --> 00:26:18,240
Anyway is a surgeon so  in itself it works quite

632
00:26:18,240 --> 00:26:20,580
well eh only yes in terms of resorts it

633
00:26:20,580 --> 00:26:21,900
would be what I hope that there will be even

634
00:26:21,900 --> 00:26:23,159
thinner products that we

635
00:26:23,159 --> 00:26:25,580
will stop there eh That is completely a

636
00:26:25,580 --> 00:26:29,100
product of a higher usuality I think but

637
00:26:29,100 --> 00:26:30,299
I would like it if we made even more

638
00:26:30,299 --> 00:26:33,600
economical products  come so eh

639
00:26:33,600 --> 00:26:36,120
Well this was the short about

640
00:26:36,120 --> 00:26:38,159
lost to you so if there are any questions

641
00:26:38,159 --> 00:26:41,659
then maybe still time for

642
00:26:47,460 --> 00:26:49,760
yes

643
00:26:50,159 --> 00:26:52,460


644
00:27:05,240 --> 00:27:07,500
do it exactly like that that's a little more you

645
00:27:07,500 --> 00:27:08,820
have much more control over what you do

646
00:27:08,820 --> 00:27:10,080
and of course she can filter everything out

647
00:27:10,080 --> 00:27:11,820
because you  don't want you but that's

648
00:27:11,820 --> 00:27:13,500
something you do isn't it you choose it

649
00:27:13,500 --> 00:27:14,880
all say this block this

650
00:27:14,880 --> 00:27:17,220
use or I want to tweet with this

651
00:27:17,220 --> 00:27:19,620
#mezien but you are still in

652
00:27:19,620 --> 00:27:21,240
control of time so I think it doesn't

653
00:27:21,240 --> 00:27:22,980
happen automatically and I  I've

654
00:27:22,980 --> 00:27:24,179
seen a video like that once that

655
00:27:24,179 --> 00:27:25,500
someone eh I think was with Arjen

656
00:27:25,500 --> 00:27:27,659
Lubach and the idea of ​​the demoder ship is the

657
00:27:27,659 --> 00:27:29,880
2nd Just say eh two certain videos

658
00:27:29,880 --> 00:27:32,039
looking on YouTube only recommen

659
00:27:32,039 --> 00:27:33,960
this one says in that corner eh

660
00:27:33,960 --> 00:27:35,220
you really think that  not going to get anymore so

661
00:27:35,220 --> 00:27:37,080
that rapt is less

662
00:27:37,080 --> 00:27:39,240
polarizing I think hope that yes I don't know

663
00:27:39,240 --> 00:27:40,980
if the typing people from Tower because

664
00:27:40,980 --> 00:27:42,840
we fell for that flatly said or that

665
00:27:42,840 --> 00:27:45,059
immediately the good one you see would also be in this now

666
00:27:45,059 --> 00:27:47,520
so eh yes well for the  future

667
00:27:47,520 --> 00:27:49,260
I think this is healthier than what we

668
00:27:49,260 --> 00:27:51,620
have now yes

669
00:27:52,080 --> 00:27:55,559
any other questions or else we leave it

670
00:27:55,559 --> 00:27:57,419
at that

671
00:27:57,419 --> 00:27:59,440
okay thank you

672
00:27:59,440 --> 00:28:02,519
