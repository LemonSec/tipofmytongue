1
00:00:02,460 --> 00:00:05,819
hello everyone welcome

2
00:00:05,819 --> 00:00:09,620
my god there are a lot of you

3
00:00:09,720 --> 00:00:11,580
everybody's still awake after the

4
00:00:11,580 --> 00:00:14,400
accident Lynch they serve here

5
00:00:14,400 --> 00:00:15,660
awesome

6
00:00:15,660 --> 00:00:18,140
well

7
00:00:18,140 --> 00:00:20,939
probably just napping everyone it's a

8
00:00:20,939 --> 00:00:22,800
bit hard to see there because

9
00:00:22,800 --> 00:00:25,220
this is slide one of

10
00:00:25,220 --> 00:00:28,439
384 so we're going to need the hour

11
00:00:28,439 --> 00:00:29,880
now I'm just messing with you they're

12
00:00:29,880 --> 00:00:32,759
less than 30 slides

13
00:00:32,759 --> 00:00:35,160
Network hacking 301

14
00:00:35,160 --> 00:00:38,160
previous to 101 and 201 said basic

15
00:00:38,160 --> 00:00:40,379
networking Network hacks encounter

16
00:00:40,379 --> 00:00:42,059
measures for educational purposes only

17
00:00:42,059 --> 00:00:44,399
that one remain the same this one is

18
00:00:44,399 --> 00:00:46,680
Advanced networking networks hacks and

19
00:00:46,680 --> 00:00:48,899
counter measures the pilot Remains the

20
00:00:48,899 --> 00:00:51,059
Same is the for educational purposes

21
00:00:51,059 --> 00:00:51,960
only

22
00:00:51,960 --> 00:00:54,719
the previous presentation was fit for

23
00:00:54,719 --> 00:00:56,640
both

24
00:00:56,640 --> 00:00:59,699
Network owners or people responsible for

25
00:00:59,699 --> 00:01:00,840
networking

26
00:01:00,840 --> 00:01:03,480
to make sure that what could happen on a

27
00:01:03,480 --> 00:01:04,680
certain

28
00:01:04,680 --> 00:01:07,680
type of network what could happen What

29
00:01:07,680 --> 00:01:09,900
should happen and how to defend against

30
00:01:09,900 --> 00:01:11,760
the stuff that could happen that you

31
00:01:11,760 --> 00:01:13,439
don't want to happen

32
00:01:13,439 --> 00:01:15,960
this one has a slightly larger audience

33
00:01:15,960 --> 00:01:18,240
and I'm going to get there in a while

34
00:01:18,240 --> 00:01:21,000
but first a short recap

35
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:23,520
the network hacking 101 like I said the

36
00:01:23,520 --> 00:01:25,320
basic networking

37
00:01:25,320 --> 00:01:27,000
going to be go through the entire

38
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:28,680
presentation very brief there's a

39
00:01:28,680 --> 00:01:30,299
scenario you go to the favorite coffee

40
00:01:30,299 --> 00:01:32,040
house you connect to the wireless

41
00:01:32,040 --> 00:01:34,140
network and browse to Facebook

42
00:01:34,140 --> 00:01:37,700
what could possibly go wrong

43
00:01:39,360 --> 00:01:42,540
we talked about Wi-Fi pineapples we

44
00:01:42,540 --> 00:01:45,540
talked about DNS spoofing we talked

45
00:01:45,540 --> 00:01:47,640
about our poisoning we talked about drug

46
00:01:47,640 --> 00:01:49,860
DHCP servers

47
00:01:49,860 --> 00:01:51,299
and then there were the character

48
00:01:51,299 --> 00:01:52,619
measures

49
00:01:52,619 --> 00:01:55,619
be careful Implement some basic security

50
00:01:55,619 --> 00:01:59,520
measures on your network and verify the

51
00:01:59,520 --> 00:02:01,560
status of your VPN and use a VPN if you

52
00:02:01,560 --> 00:02:03,920
have one

53
00:02:04,380 --> 00:02:06,780
it's a very very brief summary

54
00:02:06,780 --> 00:02:08,520
then there's the network hacking 201

55
00:02:08,520 --> 00:02:11,038
which is still basic networking

56
00:02:11,038 --> 00:02:13,920
networking hex encounter measures

57
00:02:13,920 --> 00:02:15,780
then we were talking about zeros we were

58
00:02:15,780 --> 00:02:17,280
talking about heroes we were talking

59
00:02:17,280 --> 00:02:19,739
about switches routers hack switch hack

60
00:02:19,739 --> 00:02:22,379
routers and we even had a booty session

61
00:02:22,379 --> 00:02:24,780
on screen

62
00:02:24,780 --> 00:02:27,840
I'm not going to go into the the zeros

63
00:02:27,840 --> 00:02:29,340
here they already had their own musical

64
00:02:29,340 --> 00:02:32,040
here on the hacker Hotel

65
00:02:32,040 --> 00:02:34,099
but I'm going to

66
00:02:34,099 --> 00:02:36,720
leave them here to make sure that the

67
00:02:36,720 --> 00:02:38,580
time frame of the presentation is a bit

68
00:02:38,580 --> 00:02:41,879
known basically then everybody had a

69
00:02:41,879 --> 00:02:44,340
real Brook in their slide deck in one

70
00:02:44,340 --> 00:02:45,780
way or another so there's more or less

71
00:02:45,780 --> 00:02:47,340
dates the

72
00:02:47,340 --> 00:02:50,760
hacking networks 201 the people on the

73
00:02:50,760 --> 00:02:54,900
right they're still bear naming the most

74
00:02:54,900 --> 00:02:57,239
the lady over here is Radia Pullman

75
00:02:57,239 --> 00:02:59,160
inventor of the spanning tree protocol

76
00:02:59,160 --> 00:03:01,800
and one of the most important people in

77
00:03:01,800 --> 00:03:04,080
inventing part of the land Network

78
00:03:04,080 --> 00:03:05,580
protocol

79
00:03:05,580 --> 00:03:07,319
the guy in the right is someone to be

80
00:03:07,319 --> 00:03:08,340
proud of

81
00:03:08,340 --> 00:03:10,940
he's from the Netherlands

82
00:03:10,940 --> 00:03:13,440
inventor of the shortest path first

83
00:03:13,440 --> 00:03:16,260
algorithm used in ospf

84
00:03:16,260 --> 00:03:18,300
so we were talking about spelling twin

85
00:03:18,300 --> 00:03:21,000
ospf and this one

86
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:22,920
how to hack them and a couple of

87
00:03:22,920 --> 00:03:24,840
mitigating measures

88
00:03:24,840 --> 00:03:27,560
for example have a property Design

89
00:03:27,560 --> 00:03:30,420
Channel root guard and if you want to

90
00:03:30,420 --> 00:03:32,220
add extra security into form

91
00:03:32,220 --> 00:03:33,680
authentication

92
00:03:33,680 --> 00:03:36,720
802.1x is a mitigating measure

93
00:03:36,720 --> 00:03:39,659
then look at a possible alternatives for

94
00:03:39,659 --> 00:03:41,879
spanning tree protocol the trill

95
00:03:41,879 --> 00:03:45,000
shortest path bridging fee excellent and

96
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:47,280
the most important part is training make

97
00:03:47,280 --> 00:03:48,959
sure that the people who are responsible

98
00:03:48,959 --> 00:03:51,239
for managing the network have received

99
00:03:51,239 --> 00:03:52,620
proper training so they know the

100
00:03:52,620 --> 00:03:54,000
protocol they know the best practices

101
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:55,739
they know the equipment they know the

102
00:03:55,739 --> 00:03:56,760
design

103
00:03:56,760 --> 00:03:58,200
make sure they know what they're talking

104
00:03:58,200 --> 00:03:59,340
about

105
00:03:59,340 --> 00:04:01,200
then there's logging

106
00:04:01,200 --> 00:04:04,019
and logging is only as useful as you if

107
00:04:04,019 --> 00:04:07,260
you ever use it so not only lock

108
00:04:07,260 --> 00:04:10,200
everything but read them that does not

109
00:04:10,200 --> 00:04:11,760
mean you have to read through every

110
00:04:11,760 --> 00:04:13,080
single line

111
00:04:13,080 --> 00:04:15,720
automate or

112
00:04:15,720 --> 00:04:18,540
make sure that you start looking at the

113
00:04:18,540 --> 00:04:20,579
most important ones or the one that

114
00:04:20,579 --> 00:04:23,100
occurs the most of the time and there's

115
00:04:23,100 --> 00:04:25,199
another couple of security feature like

116
00:04:25,199 --> 00:04:27,479
Port security and bpdu guard but

117
00:04:27,479 --> 00:04:29,280
mitigating measures

118
00:04:29,280 --> 00:04:33,059
design 802.1x

119
00:04:33,120 --> 00:04:35,340
okay this worksheet will be hacking

120
00:04:35,340 --> 00:04:38,040
802.1x

121
00:04:38,040 --> 00:04:40,380
have I been lying to you why would I

122
00:04:40,380 --> 00:04:43,199
recommend implementing it as an as a

123
00:04:43,199 --> 00:04:45,180
security measure well I'm now going to

124
00:04:45,180 --> 00:04:46,080
show you

125
00:04:46,080 --> 00:04:49,040
how it can be broken

126
00:04:49,040 --> 00:04:52,500
well a good security consists of many

127
00:04:52,500 --> 00:04:55,380
layers that means if there's if a

128
00:04:55,380 --> 00:04:57,180
security gets breached but it takes a

129
00:04:57,180 --> 00:04:59,820
lot of time if you put enough of them in

130
00:04:59,820 --> 00:05:02,220
your network you're probably safer than

131
00:05:02,220 --> 00:05:04,560
your next door neighbors

132
00:05:04,560 --> 00:05:07,560
as the previous scenarios we're going to

133
00:05:07,560 --> 00:05:09,479
as the previous presentation we're going

134
00:05:09,479 --> 00:05:12,000
to start with a nice scenario but from

135
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:13,440
the coffee shop we went to a small

136
00:05:13,440 --> 00:05:15,419
Enterprise we're now going to

137
00:05:15,419 --> 00:05:18,900
a bit more high visibility Enterprise

138
00:05:18,900 --> 00:05:20,699
you're in a campus with decent

139
00:05:20,699 --> 00:05:23,100
networking in place with a security team

140
00:05:23,100 --> 00:05:26,699
regular audits the best practices even

141
00:05:26,699 --> 00:05:28,979
pen testing is performed every now and

142
00:05:28,979 --> 00:05:30,600
again

143
00:05:30,600 --> 00:05:33,479
raising the bar here

144
00:05:33,479 --> 00:05:36,180
what could possibly go wrong

145
00:05:36,180 --> 00:05:38,160
as I said just before the target

146
00:05:38,160 --> 00:05:39,419
audience for this particular

147
00:05:39,419 --> 00:05:41,880
presentation is not more or less people

148
00:05:41,880 --> 00:05:44,520
responsible for a network in which way

149
00:05:44,520 --> 00:05:46,440
or another but we're also going to look

150
00:05:46,440 --> 00:05:48,900
at different roles for example what

151
00:05:48,900 --> 00:05:51,000
could hackers do what could pen testers

152
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:54,000
do and for all of you who don't know pen

153
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:56,160
testers are good guys but they're trying

154
00:05:56,160 --> 00:05:58,620
the techniques of the bad guys so there

155
00:05:58,620 --> 00:06:01,020
are bits bit bits of things you

156
00:06:01,020 --> 00:06:03,840
may have to do but one of the things you

157
00:06:03,840 --> 00:06:05,820
should not do is to make sure that you

158
00:06:05,820 --> 00:06:08,280
amp up security specifically for pen

159
00:06:08,280 --> 00:06:10,259
testers because you're only deceiving

160
00:06:10,259 --> 00:06:12,539
yourself then

161
00:06:12,539 --> 00:06:14,940
what could possibly go wrong let's start

162
00:06:14,940 --> 00:06:17,699
with the basics

163
00:06:17,699 --> 00:06:19,800
with a company like the scenario we have

164
00:06:19,800 --> 00:06:21,960
here it's probably reasonable to assume

165
00:06:21,960 --> 00:06:24,360
that a proper Network design is in place

166
00:06:24,360 --> 00:06:26,280
it's not out of the box plugged in and

167
00:06:26,280 --> 00:06:28,680
it works and then and don't touch it

168
00:06:28,680 --> 00:06:31,560
probably also has a decent security

169
00:06:31,560 --> 00:06:33,360
design

170
00:06:33,360 --> 00:06:35,699
and given the scope and amount of work

171
00:06:35,699 --> 00:06:37,139
and money that the company put in

172
00:06:37,139 --> 00:06:39,300
there's probably also proper maintenance

173
00:06:39,300 --> 00:06:41,340
and management

174
00:06:41,340 --> 00:06:43,380
um if they hire Penta so they're

175
00:06:43,380 --> 00:06:45,060
probably reasonable security conscious

176
00:06:45,060 --> 00:06:47,639
company it might be a company with a

177
00:06:47,639 --> 00:06:49,560
crunch use their data want to have it

178
00:06:49,560 --> 00:06:51,120
heavily protected it might be a

179
00:06:51,120 --> 00:06:53,580
financial it might be in healthcare

180
00:06:53,580 --> 00:06:55,020
who knows

181
00:06:55,020 --> 00:06:57,060
everything is applicable to all of those

182
00:06:57,060 --> 00:06:59,479
companies

183
00:06:59,819 --> 00:07:01,979
then there's the heart love hate

184
00:07:01,979 --> 00:07:04,620
relationship between 802.1x and Pen

185
00:07:04,620 --> 00:07:06,660
testers

186
00:07:06,660 --> 00:07:09,180
another question that was asked multiple

187
00:07:09,180 --> 00:07:10,620
times during the years where Penthouse

188
00:07:10,620 --> 00:07:13,020
says can you please disable your network

189
00:07:13,020 --> 00:07:17,220
access control your 802.1x so we can

190
00:07:17,220 --> 00:07:19,560
stop wasting time trying to bypass it

191
00:07:19,560 --> 00:07:22,020
and get to the meat of the situation oh

192
00:07:22,020 --> 00:07:23,340
never mind we'll just use the printer

193
00:07:23,340 --> 00:07:24,960
network cable and it doesn't usually

194
00:07:24,960 --> 00:07:27,660
have 802.1x

195
00:07:27,660 --> 00:07:31,800
these days it's on one end it's

196
00:07:31,800 --> 00:07:33,599
easier to

197
00:07:33,599 --> 00:07:37,440
negate the impact of 802.1x and on the

198
00:07:37,440 --> 00:07:38,880
other hand it's

199
00:07:38,880 --> 00:07:43,979
still an extra hurdle to bridge

200
00:07:43,979 --> 00:07:45,900
don't worry we'll get back to the

201
00:07:45,900 --> 00:07:48,318
printers

202
00:07:48,660 --> 00:07:50,880
let's start with the basics the term has

203
00:07:50,880 --> 00:07:53,819
been named a number of times what is it

204
00:07:53,819 --> 00:07:57,240
it's an IEEE standard it has it was

205
00:07:57,240 --> 00:07:59,580
started in 2001 for the first iteration

206
00:07:59,580 --> 00:08:02,120
for Wyatt network security

207
00:08:02,120 --> 00:08:04,800
2004 Wireless was added and there was a

208
00:08:04,800 --> 00:08:07,139
later version in 2010

209
00:08:07,139 --> 00:08:11,340
it defines e a p o l which is the

210
00:08:11,340 --> 00:08:12,960
abbreviation for extensible

211
00:08:12,960 --> 00:08:16,259
Authentication Protocol over LAN

212
00:08:16,259 --> 00:08:19,379
and it uses radius on the back end

213
00:08:19,379 --> 00:08:23,060
it's very very old

214
00:08:24,020 --> 00:08:27,539
there is some dial up in the radius

215
00:08:27,539 --> 00:08:29,639
abbreviation that's how old this

216
00:08:29,639 --> 00:08:31,319
technology is

217
00:08:31,319 --> 00:08:33,059
can be used in wired and wireless

218
00:08:33,059 --> 00:08:37,740
networks and its authentication only

219
00:08:37,740 --> 00:08:40,860
doesn't Implement any encryption any

220
00:08:40,860 --> 00:08:44,700
additional security authentication only

221
00:08:44,700 --> 00:08:48,420
for the accessing of the network

222
00:08:48,420 --> 00:08:49,860
it can be expanded

223
00:08:49,860 --> 00:08:52,920
but in essence 802.1x is authentication

224
00:08:52,920 --> 00:08:54,959
only

225
00:08:54,959 --> 00:08:56,700
in the basis it's a very simple protocol

226
00:08:56,700 --> 00:08:58,800
it describes three roles

227
00:08:58,800 --> 00:09:01,320
a supplicant an authenticator and an

228
00:09:01,320 --> 00:09:03,720
authentication server don't worry this

229
00:09:03,720 --> 00:09:07,160
is a lot of text I have pictures

230
00:09:10,260 --> 00:09:12,240
a basic architecture looks like this

231
00:09:12,240 --> 00:09:14,279
there are devices who want to access the

232
00:09:14,279 --> 00:09:16,320
network whether it's a mobile device or

233
00:09:16,320 --> 00:09:17,339
computer

234
00:09:17,339 --> 00:09:19,560
or a printer or network camera or

235
00:09:19,560 --> 00:09:22,440
whatever is going to connect to a

236
00:09:22,440 --> 00:09:24,660
wireless a wireless access point or

237
00:09:24,660 --> 00:09:27,480
wired access switch

238
00:09:27,480 --> 00:09:29,519
when a client knocks on the door for the

239
00:09:29,519 --> 00:09:31,800
switch a the cable gets connected and

240
00:09:31,800 --> 00:09:34,760
Link comes up the switch doesn't allow

241
00:09:34,760 --> 00:09:37,920
anything but one thing

242
00:09:37,920 --> 00:09:40,260
completely unauthenticated it drops

243
00:09:40,260 --> 00:09:43,459
every single packet that you send to it

244
00:09:43,459 --> 00:09:46,440
except extensible Authentication

245
00:09:46,440 --> 00:09:49,500
Protocol over Lan frames those are the

246
00:09:49,500 --> 00:09:52,019
only ones that are allowed when the

247
00:09:52,019 --> 00:09:54,540
switchboard is unauthenticated

248
00:09:54,540 --> 00:09:57,120
there's no IP here yet it'll come

249
00:09:57,120 --> 00:09:58,860
afterwards if you after you authenticate

250
00:09:58,860 --> 00:10:00,779
the HTTP kicks in you get an IP address

251
00:10:00,779 --> 00:10:02,820
you have an IP network at the very

252
00:10:02,820 --> 00:10:04,320
beginning you don't have an IP

253
00:10:04,320 --> 00:10:06,480
networking here so all of the other

254
00:10:06,480 --> 00:10:08,300
stuff that was in the previous

255
00:10:08,300 --> 00:10:12,240
presentations about our poisoning and DH

256
00:10:12,240 --> 00:10:14,820
Rogue DHCP service it doesn't even work

257
00:10:14,820 --> 00:10:17,100
because it's not allowed

258
00:10:17,100 --> 00:10:20,040
if it's not EAP ol

259
00:10:20,040 --> 00:10:22,440
it gets dropped as soon as it hits the

260
00:10:22,440 --> 00:10:24,180
first Network device

261
00:10:24,180 --> 00:10:25,920
the part behind here

262
00:10:25,920 --> 00:10:29,820
is an IP network the policy server that

263
00:10:29,820 --> 00:10:32,100
serves as an authentication server it

264
00:10:32,100 --> 00:10:34,080
can be local it can be remote it can be

265
00:10:34,080 --> 00:10:36,360
a 100 kilometers away there's an IP

266
00:10:36,360 --> 00:10:38,580
network in between it'll probably work

267
00:10:38,580 --> 00:10:41,279
and after that it the uh the credentials

268
00:10:41,279 --> 00:10:43,740
supported supplied by the device get

269
00:10:43,740 --> 00:10:45,899
checked against some sort of Truth and

270
00:10:45,899 --> 00:10:47,760
database it might be local it might be

271
00:10:47,760 --> 00:10:50,220
remote but the roles that are part of

272
00:10:50,220 --> 00:10:51,600
the standard are supplicant

273
00:10:51,600 --> 00:10:56,120
authenticator and authentication server

274
00:10:59,820 --> 00:11:02,040
what should happen

275
00:11:02,040 --> 00:11:04,260
is either the supplicant or the

276
00:11:04,260 --> 00:11:05,519
Authenticator

277
00:11:05,519 --> 00:11:08,760
starts the authentication process it can

278
00:11:08,760 --> 00:11:10,200
be the supplicant says Hey I want to

279
00:11:10,200 --> 00:11:12,420
authenticate what can be the switch this

280
00:11:12,420 --> 00:11:14,519
says okay who are you

281
00:11:14,519 --> 00:11:17,339
then there's some sort of negotiation

282
00:11:17,339 --> 00:11:19,620
on the front end it's simple ethernet

283
00:11:19,620 --> 00:11:21,180
frames

284
00:11:21,180 --> 00:11:24,959
for EAP ol on the back end it's the same

285
00:11:24,959 --> 00:11:26,720
EAP information

286
00:11:26,720 --> 00:11:28,800
encapsulated in the radius protocol

287
00:11:28,800 --> 00:11:31,019
encapsulating RP going towards the

288
00:11:31,019 --> 00:11:33,779
authentication server

289
00:11:33,779 --> 00:11:36,360
when the entire negotiation is done the

290
00:11:36,360 --> 00:11:39,660
authentication Services yes

291
00:11:39,660 --> 00:11:40,860
or no

292
00:11:40,860 --> 00:11:42,000
and then

293
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:45,360
the answer is no the switchboard in case

294
00:11:45,360 --> 00:11:47,360
of switchboard will remain

295
00:11:47,360 --> 00:11:50,100
unauthenticated and nothing will go

296
00:11:50,100 --> 00:11:53,760
through unless something else happens

297
00:11:53,760 --> 00:11:56,160
if it's a success then you get full

298
00:11:56,160 --> 00:11:58,620
access to the network then DHCP kicks in

299
00:11:58,620 --> 00:12:00,240
etc etc etc

300
00:12:00,240 --> 00:12:01,800
you can

301
00:12:01,800 --> 00:12:05,040
enhance this as much as you want you can

302
00:12:05,040 --> 00:12:06,660
say oh if you're that usually you're

303
00:12:06,660 --> 00:12:08,880
going to put another VLAN or we're going

304
00:12:08,880 --> 00:12:10,500
to implement some additional security

305
00:12:10,500 --> 00:12:12,959
controls or you get some nice quality of

306
00:12:12,959 --> 00:12:14,399
service because if you're on the board

307
00:12:14,399 --> 00:12:16,440
of directors and that means your video

308
00:12:16,440 --> 00:12:18,959
once that status that are

309
00:12:18,959 --> 00:12:22,079
whichever those can be pushed towards

310
00:12:22,079 --> 00:12:24,540
the authenticator the the switching in

311
00:12:24,540 --> 00:12:26,880
most cases but it's not really part of

312
00:12:26,880 --> 00:12:29,399
the 802.1x standard because it's about

313
00:12:29,399 --> 00:12:32,640
authentication only

314
00:12:32,640 --> 00:12:34,980
all additions whether it's posture

315
00:12:34,980 --> 00:12:37,019
assessment make sure antivirus is up to

316
00:12:37,019 --> 00:12:40,220
date is an add-on to that

317
00:12:44,160 --> 00:12:47,180
this one's for him

318
00:12:47,220 --> 00:12:48,420
this is

319
00:12:48,420 --> 00:12:51,360
how short this negotiation on a packet

320
00:12:51,360 --> 00:12:53,220
level actually looks like

321
00:12:53,220 --> 00:12:55,620
it's done in no time it's very brief

322
00:12:55,620 --> 00:12:59,000
it's usually just a couple of seconds

323
00:12:59,399 --> 00:13:02,339
after that authentication is done and

324
00:13:02,339 --> 00:13:05,959
our date is able to flow freely

325
00:13:07,200 --> 00:13:08,940
this is going to be a very interesting

326
00:13:08,940 --> 00:13:10,560
slide

327
00:13:10,560 --> 00:13:14,160
because what I said before

328
00:13:14,160 --> 00:13:16,620
has to be taken with a grain of salt AAP

329
00:13:16,620 --> 00:13:20,459
extensive Authentication Protocol is not

330
00:13:20,459 --> 00:13:23,579
really a protocol it's more like a

331
00:13:23,579 --> 00:13:24,720
framework

332
00:13:24,720 --> 00:13:27,660
it has a couple of standard it has to

333
00:13:27,660 --> 00:13:29,459
meet you have to provide a number of

334
00:13:29,459 --> 00:13:30,660
information you have to provide

335
00:13:30,660 --> 00:13:32,880
something you have to adhere to certain

336
00:13:32,880 --> 00:13:34,980
standards

337
00:13:34,980 --> 00:13:37,079
but it's accessible if you want to roll

338
00:13:37,079 --> 00:13:39,600
your own I think you can but there are

339
00:13:39,600 --> 00:13:43,139
many many different flavors of extensive

340
00:13:43,139 --> 00:13:45,480
Authentication Protocol most of them are

341
00:13:45,480 --> 00:13:47,700
quite old like the md5 one

342
00:13:47,700 --> 00:13:50,160
it's it's it can be hacked by a

343
00:13:50,160 --> 00:13:52,320
dictionary attack it's really old it's

344
00:13:52,320 --> 00:13:55,620
really vulnerable and the cracking Brute

345
00:13:55,620 --> 00:13:58,200
Force cracking can be done in a feasible

346
00:13:58,200 --> 00:14:00,019
time at that

347
00:14:00,019 --> 00:14:02,579
the multiple flavors here I'm not going

348
00:14:02,579 --> 00:14:04,079
through each and every one of them some

349
00:14:04,079 --> 00:14:06,180
use certificates some don't it basically

350
00:14:06,180 --> 00:14:09,120
means the more complex it is to set up

351
00:14:09,120 --> 00:14:12,180
the more secure it should become if it

352
00:14:12,180 --> 00:14:15,060
gets set up properly

353
00:14:15,060 --> 00:14:16,680
and

354
00:14:16,680 --> 00:14:19,920
exactly so it takes a bit more time and

355
00:14:19,920 --> 00:14:22,019
effort to make sure that you pick the

356
00:14:22,019 --> 00:14:24,779
right one and make sure it's secure but

357
00:14:24,779 --> 00:14:26,820
it's only as good as the implementation

358
00:14:26,820 --> 00:14:27,839
if you make mistakes during

359
00:14:27,839 --> 00:14:29,940
implementation you might have a decent

360
00:14:29,940 --> 00:14:33,360
EAP standard for your exit 821x

361
00:14:33,360 --> 00:14:35,940
but you may still be vulnerable for

362
00:14:35,940 --> 00:14:37,980
things like this and there are many of

363
00:14:37,980 --> 00:14:40,160
them

364
00:14:40,800 --> 00:14:42,180
there are a number of well-known

365
00:14:42,180 --> 00:14:44,220
vulnerabilities in the protocol

366
00:14:44,220 --> 00:14:46,380
because like I said in the front end

367
00:14:46,380 --> 00:14:51,240
part it's not uh IP so the all The Usual

368
00:14:51,240 --> 00:14:53,459
Suspects in IP hacking like are

369
00:14:53,459 --> 00:14:55,680
poisoning and stuff like that is of no

370
00:14:55,680 --> 00:14:57,899
use but it's still ethernet

371
00:14:57,899 --> 00:15:00,120
one of the first six first successful

372
00:15:00,120 --> 00:15:03,240
attacks were done hearing a hub

373
00:15:03,240 --> 00:15:05,820
it's a very old technology it works on a

374
00:15:05,820 --> 00:15:08,160
layer one of the ocean model

375
00:15:08,160 --> 00:15:11,100
which means physical data and bits only

376
00:15:11,100 --> 00:15:14,579
it literally deals with bits only

377
00:15:14,579 --> 00:15:17,100
and it doesn't do the funny stuff like

378
00:15:17,100 --> 00:15:18,959
oh that's Mac address it doesn't know

379
00:15:18,959 --> 00:15:21,360
what a MAC address is

380
00:15:21,360 --> 00:15:23,639
using a hub it's possible to make sure

381
00:15:23,639 --> 00:15:26,579
that an authenticated device on a

382
00:15:26,579 --> 00:15:28,320
certain switchboard would happen between

383
00:15:28,320 --> 00:15:30,959
make sure the switch transitions from

384
00:15:30,959 --> 00:15:32,639
authenticated

385
00:15:32,639 --> 00:15:35,579
to active and everyone connected to the

386
00:15:35,579 --> 00:15:36,480
hub

387
00:15:36,480 --> 00:15:39,060
can then interact with the rest of the

388
00:15:39,060 --> 00:15:42,000
network there are a bunch of downsides

389
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:44,100
but if you're it really depends on the

390
00:15:44,100 --> 00:15:45,959
purpose of of the exercise of what

391
00:15:45,959 --> 00:15:47,760
you're trying to do I have may be

392
00:15:47,760 --> 00:15:49,079
sufficient

393
00:15:49,079 --> 00:15:51,060
and it doesn't even matter which flavor

394
00:15:51,060 --> 00:15:56,060
of the EP you're using

395
00:15:56,760 --> 00:16:00,600
the important part is you're trying to

396
00:16:00,600 --> 00:16:02,880
live with the Authentication Protocol

397
00:16:02,880 --> 00:16:05,519
and make sure on with a proper device on

398
00:16:05,519 --> 00:16:07,920
the same network port and it transitions

399
00:16:07,920 --> 00:16:11,360
to proper State and it's done

400
00:16:12,360 --> 00:16:14,100
um a couple of improvements can be made

401
00:16:14,100 --> 00:16:16,440
for example if a switchboard sees

402
00:16:16,440 --> 00:16:18,959
multiple Mac addresses it usually

403
00:16:18,959 --> 00:16:20,699
authenticates a single Mac address and

404
00:16:20,699 --> 00:16:23,220
not other Mac addresses that can pop pop

405
00:16:23,220 --> 00:16:24,720
in through that port

406
00:16:24,720 --> 00:16:26,220
in the very beginning of the

407
00:16:26,220 --> 00:16:28,680
implementation that was not the case it

408
00:16:28,680 --> 00:16:30,240
was simply a port is allowed on the

409
00:16:30,240 --> 00:16:31,800
network reporters not allowed to the

410
00:16:31,800 --> 00:16:33,779
network

411
00:16:33,779 --> 00:16:36,600
logo of frames are in clear text

412
00:16:36,600 --> 00:16:39,000
and they do not contain data matching

413
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:40,980
the initial Exchange

414
00:16:40,980 --> 00:16:44,160
that means that if you're on the Hub

415
00:16:44,160 --> 00:16:45,779
and your flood

416
00:16:45,779 --> 00:16:48,420
log off frames it's a denial of shares

417
00:16:48,420 --> 00:16:51,979
from the legitimate client

418
00:16:53,820 --> 00:16:55,620
but there's another denial of service

419
00:16:55,620 --> 00:16:58,019
attack for this situation possible

420
00:16:58,019 --> 00:17:00,360
radius may be an old protocol but

421
00:17:00,360 --> 00:17:02,579
depending on sizing and scaling if you

422
00:17:02,579 --> 00:17:04,919
have 10 thousands of clients

423
00:17:04,919 --> 00:17:07,260
your server can get heavy

424
00:17:07,260 --> 00:17:10,020
if you're forwarding all sorts of

425
00:17:10,020 --> 00:17:11,939
traffic to what your radio server is at

426
00:17:11,939 --> 00:17:13,439
denial of service on the radio server

427
00:17:13,439 --> 00:17:15,240
that means the radio server does not

428
00:17:15,240 --> 00:17:17,520
have the opportunity to answer to

429
00:17:17,520 --> 00:17:19,500
legitimate requests

430
00:17:19,500 --> 00:17:22,260
and that means legitimate requests don't

431
00:17:22,260 --> 00:17:24,660
get handled and the port stays

432
00:17:24,660 --> 00:17:27,299
unauthenticated client's legitimate

433
00:17:27,299 --> 00:17:29,160
clients cannot

434
00:17:29,160 --> 00:17:32,040
a connected Network

435
00:17:32,040 --> 00:17:34,679
and there's of course Max spoofing

436
00:17:34,679 --> 00:17:36,720
it's also usable for help then you can

437
00:17:36,720 --> 00:17:38,160
send some traffic

438
00:17:38,160 --> 00:17:41,160
but not very much not very well

439
00:17:41,160 --> 00:17:44,400
there was a target attack for the

440
00:17:44,400 --> 00:17:46,080
well-in vulnerabilities it's called

441
00:17:46,080 --> 00:17:47,940
Marvin it's a tool don't worry I'll be

442
00:17:47,940 --> 00:17:49,559
crediting at the end of the presentation

443
00:17:49,559 --> 00:17:52,440
it's written in Java and it it's a proof

444
00:17:52,440 --> 00:17:54,720
of concept tool to make sure that you

445
00:17:54,720 --> 00:17:56,760
can actually live on the same network in

446
00:17:56,760 --> 00:17:58,679
between the supplicant and the

447
00:17:58,679 --> 00:18:00,059
Authenticator

448
00:18:00,059 --> 00:18:03,960
and Bridge the legitimate traffic to and

449
00:18:03,960 --> 00:18:06,360
from and maybe have some sort of small

450
00:18:06,360 --> 00:18:07,500
access

451
00:18:07,500 --> 00:18:11,400
to the network based on that port

452
00:18:11,400 --> 00:18:13,440
a well-known vulnerability already named

453
00:18:13,440 --> 00:18:15,720
it it's very difficult to implement a

454
00:18:15,720 --> 00:18:17,460
proper solution

455
00:18:17,460 --> 00:18:19,500
it's also very expensive there are of

456
00:18:19,500 --> 00:18:22,500
course free uh free radius servers but

457
00:18:22,500 --> 00:18:24,299
when you have a Cisco IRIS a Rubik clear

458
00:18:24,299 --> 00:18:27,600
pause just name them those are expensive

459
00:18:27,600 --> 00:18:30,059
and have a head count so the larger your

460
00:18:30,059 --> 00:18:32,160
network the more you're going to pay

461
00:18:32,160 --> 00:18:33,900
and there's of course

462
00:18:33,900 --> 00:18:36,600
the Everlasting curse of the 802.1x

463
00:18:36,600 --> 00:18:38,460
implementation

464
00:18:38,460 --> 00:18:40,500
Mac address bypass

465
00:18:40,500 --> 00:18:43,559
not all devices have a supplicant

466
00:18:43,559 --> 00:18:45,840
most dramatic are usually the printers

467
00:18:45,840 --> 00:18:48,960
some cameras a pixie boot is something

468
00:18:48,960 --> 00:18:52,559
that is not always possible using a2.1x

469
00:18:52,559 --> 00:18:54,660
supplicant and this process automation

470
00:18:54,660 --> 00:18:56,760
usually equipment that got put into

471
00:18:56,760 --> 00:18:59,100
place 20 years ago and it has an

472
00:18:59,100 --> 00:19:00,900
expected lifetime of 30 so it's going to

473
00:19:00,900 --> 00:19:03,600
be here for a while

474
00:19:03,600 --> 00:19:07,140
there's also a hidden trap in here

475
00:19:07,140 --> 00:19:10,320
because nowadays some printers do have

476
00:19:10,320 --> 00:19:13,380
an 82.1 supplicant

477
00:19:13,380 --> 00:19:15,600
you ain't that's why the first slide I

478
00:19:15,600 --> 00:19:16,740
said I'll never mind you would use the

479
00:19:16,740 --> 00:19:18,660
printer port first

480
00:19:18,660 --> 00:19:20,880
I see a lot of places that the printer

481
00:19:20,880 --> 00:19:23,340
is in the same subnet as the client

482
00:19:23,340 --> 00:19:25,320
it's not always practical but I see it a

483
00:19:25,320 --> 00:19:26,640
lot

484
00:19:26,640 --> 00:19:28,559
if you segment the printer off and put

485
00:19:28,559 --> 00:19:31,320
it in a separate Network it's usually

486
00:19:31,320 --> 00:19:33,840
much better and it is less of use for

487
00:19:33,840 --> 00:19:36,000
for example a pen tester

488
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:38,400
on the other hand if you have an 82.1x

489
00:19:38,400 --> 00:19:40,020
cable printer

490
00:19:40,020 --> 00:19:42,840
you may actually allow it to join the

491
00:19:42,840 --> 00:19:44,820
workflow and then it doesn't matter as

492
00:19:44,820 --> 00:19:47,360
much that it gets

493
00:19:47,360 --> 00:19:50,160
put into a separate Network or not

494
00:19:50,160 --> 00:19:51,539
on the other hand

495
00:19:51,539 --> 00:19:53,940
we also talked about Peep and Eep and

496
00:19:53,940 --> 00:19:56,700
leap and other flavors

497
00:19:56,700 --> 00:19:59,039
if the printer Department UV is usually

498
00:19:59,039 --> 00:20:00,840
facility management and not part of RT

499
00:20:00,840 --> 00:20:02,280
for some reason

500
00:20:02,280 --> 00:20:04,620
gets told by it

501
00:20:04,620 --> 00:20:08,400
has to support eight support 802.1x

502
00:20:08,400 --> 00:20:11,280
then let's check a checkbox yes it

503
00:20:11,280 --> 00:20:12,840
supports I have the spec sheet right

504
00:20:12,840 --> 00:20:13,559
here

505
00:20:13,559 --> 00:20:16,679
okay but which flavors of the extensible

506
00:20:16,679 --> 00:20:18,480
authentication Protocols are supported

507
00:20:18,480 --> 00:20:20,220
well you never ask me any of that it's

508
00:20:20,220 --> 00:20:23,039
supported look it's a check in the box

509
00:20:23,039 --> 00:20:25,679
and then you may have another situation

510
00:20:25,679 --> 00:20:27,660
on your hand when printers can support

511
00:20:27,660 --> 00:20:32,299
it but not at the level you want

512
00:20:36,240 --> 00:20:38,340
I'm not going too much detail on this

513
00:20:38,340 --> 00:20:39,000
one

514
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:41,280
because we're mainly talking about wired

515
00:20:41,280 --> 00:20:42,840
attacks there's of course Wireless

516
00:20:42,840 --> 00:20:44,820
attacks that's also possible

517
00:20:44,820 --> 00:20:46,799
the one on the bottom left I mentioned

518
00:20:46,799 --> 00:20:48,960
during previous ones the pineapple is a

519
00:20:48,960 --> 00:20:50,820
rogue access point that has a number of

520
00:20:50,820 --> 00:20:53,460
extremely useful tools the one of us

521
00:20:53,460 --> 00:20:55,919
personally most impressed with was SSL

522
00:20:55,919 --> 00:20:56,880
strip

523
00:20:56,880 --> 00:20:59,820
that means you go to a page that has a

524
00:20:59,820 --> 00:21:02,580
certificate an SSL on the back end still

525
00:21:02,580 --> 00:21:04,860
has the encrypted site and it prints to

526
00:21:04,860 --> 00:21:07,200
the browser the unencrypted site and

527
00:21:07,200 --> 00:21:08,940
basically every username password or

528
00:21:08,940 --> 00:21:10,140
whatever you sent over it is clear

529
00:21:10,140 --> 00:21:12,360
texting can be locked interpreted

530
00:21:12,360 --> 00:21:14,820
Whatever by the pineapple it's local the

531
00:21:14,820 --> 00:21:16,919
version now I believe is looking much

532
00:21:16,919 --> 00:21:19,440
nicer with more antennas and

533
00:21:19,440 --> 00:21:21,360
probably more processing powers and more

534
00:21:21,360 --> 00:21:24,600
throughput it's a very simple device

535
00:21:24,600 --> 00:21:27,440
It's relatively cheap and it can perform

536
00:21:27,440 --> 00:21:30,900
extremely well in less secure setups for

537
00:21:30,900 --> 00:21:32,580
example with reset keys

538
00:21:32,580 --> 00:21:34,380
the one on the top right well which I

539
00:21:34,380 --> 00:21:35,820
don't know a single hacker wouldn't like

540
00:21:35,820 --> 00:21:37,559
to get his hands on this one

541
00:21:37,559 --> 00:21:39,179
it looks like watch it looks like a

542
00:21:39,179 --> 00:21:40,799
smart watch and it can do wireless

543
00:21:40,799 --> 00:21:43,140
de-authentication attacks you mainly

544
00:21:43,140 --> 00:21:44,220
select

545
00:21:44,220 --> 00:21:46,200
the network can say yes start now and

546
00:21:46,200 --> 00:21:48,120
it's going to send DL frames kicking

547
00:21:48,120 --> 00:21:50,100
each other off the network and the

548
00:21:50,100 --> 00:21:52,320
cheapest

549
00:21:52,320 --> 00:21:54,659
the for the uh the hacker on the budget

550
00:21:54,659 --> 00:21:58,380
AliExpress this one is about 20 euros

551
00:21:58,380 --> 00:22:00,360
it's nothing you might have to wait a

552
00:22:00,360 --> 00:22:02,039
couple of weeks for it

553
00:22:02,039 --> 00:22:03,600
when you have marvelous piece of

554
00:22:03,600 --> 00:22:05,959
equipment

555
00:22:06,360 --> 00:22:08,400
and

556
00:22:08,400 --> 00:22:11,460
and Panthers usually you have the even

557
00:22:11,460 --> 00:22:13,440
less conspicuous one because it looks

558
00:22:13,440 --> 00:22:16,679
rather nice it still looks like a bit

559
00:22:16,679 --> 00:22:18,780
weird

560
00:22:18,780 --> 00:22:20,880
and there's the what you can use for a

561
00:22:20,880 --> 00:22:23,159
wire detect then now it gets interesting

562
00:22:23,159 --> 00:22:26,220
because form factors are a thing

563
00:22:26,220 --> 00:22:27,780
if you need a bit more power and

564
00:22:27,780 --> 00:22:29,880
throughput you can use an interlock it's

565
00:22:29,880 --> 00:22:31,620
still reasonably small you can easily

566
00:22:31,620 --> 00:22:35,880
stash it away and it probably has the um

567
00:22:35,880 --> 00:22:38,940
the processing power to not increase

568
00:22:38,940 --> 00:22:41,159
latency and it allows for a certain

569
00:22:41,159 --> 00:22:43,740
throughput that it can actually be used

570
00:22:43,740 --> 00:22:45,600
there are also things like Cloud compute

571
00:22:45,600 --> 00:22:47,640
or even compute six but this size with a

572
00:22:47,640 --> 00:22:49,260
couple of USB necks make sure you pick

573
00:22:49,260 --> 00:22:51,059
the right one not every one of them

574
00:22:51,059 --> 00:22:54,480
supports promiscuous mode

575
00:22:54,480 --> 00:22:57,840
and don't forget the Callback

576
00:22:57,840 --> 00:23:00,720
the texts that were done way back in

577
00:23:00,720 --> 00:23:03,419
2005-2010

578
00:23:03,419 --> 00:23:06,000
in those times cellular modems were

579
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:07,980
rather expensive

580
00:23:07,980 --> 00:23:09,960
so it wasn't really not an option and

581
00:23:09,960 --> 00:23:11,400
having a third network card where you're

582
00:23:11,400 --> 00:23:13,200
going to stick it it probably was more

583
00:23:13,200 --> 00:23:17,400
widely used to have a an AP there that's

584
00:23:17,400 --> 00:23:18,900
transmitting its own signal to the

585
00:23:18,900 --> 00:23:20,520
hacker in the parking lot

586
00:23:20,520 --> 00:23:23,460
and allowing access to the bridge is

587
00:23:23,460 --> 00:23:25,799
basically what it becomes now

588
00:23:25,799 --> 00:23:28,080
into the system

589
00:23:28,080 --> 00:23:30,659
and but it's also possible if you're

590
00:23:30,659 --> 00:23:31,860
very careful

591
00:23:31,860 --> 00:23:33,900
to have the Callback done in line

592
00:23:33,900 --> 00:23:37,260
towards the authenticated switchboard

593
00:23:37,260 --> 00:23:39,240
but the chances are you're going to

594
00:23:39,240 --> 00:23:42,260
trigger some other attack

595
00:23:42,840 --> 00:23:44,820
let's make things clear

596
00:23:44,820 --> 00:23:48,840
this is a physical attack Factor only

597
00:23:48,840 --> 00:23:52,280
well it depends

598
00:23:52,679 --> 00:23:55,260
the hacker is supposed to be nearby and

599
00:23:55,260 --> 00:23:57,120
the place of the hacker is between the

600
00:23:57,120 --> 00:23:58,980
supplicant and Authenticator

601
00:23:58,980 --> 00:24:00,659
so it can

602
00:24:00,659 --> 00:24:02,640
basically not intercept the extensive

603
00:24:02,640 --> 00:24:04,799
Authentication Protocol but allow that

604
00:24:04,799 --> 00:24:07,020
one to go through so this Rich Board

605
00:24:07,020 --> 00:24:09,179
gets actually authenticated and when

606
00:24:09,179 --> 00:24:10,620
it's authenticated

607
00:24:10,620 --> 00:24:12,360
the hacker is also going to make use of

608
00:24:12,360 --> 00:24:13,919
that authenticated pause for every

609
00:24:13,919 --> 00:24:16,020
nefarious thing he wants to do

610
00:24:16,020 --> 00:24:19,940
or pen tester or whichever

611
00:24:20,340 --> 00:24:21,900
you're going to run in a couple of

612
00:24:21,900 --> 00:24:23,820
challenges then

613
00:24:23,820 --> 00:24:26,400
switchboard security

614
00:24:26,400 --> 00:24:28,500
if you go to mess around a bit and your

615
00:24:28,500 --> 00:24:30,240
nox sent its own Mac address instead of

616
00:24:30,240 --> 00:24:32,039
the client behind it Street Sports

617
00:24:32,039 --> 00:24:33,600
security kicks in

618
00:24:33,600 --> 00:24:35,880
if you have a security conscious company

619
00:24:35,880 --> 00:24:38,280
it's a manual action

620
00:24:38,280 --> 00:24:41,220
and it gets locked and alerted

621
00:24:41,220 --> 00:24:43,140
and someone's going to look at it say

622
00:24:43,140 --> 00:24:45,360
what's this then

623
00:24:45,360 --> 00:24:48,860
and it'll cost you your neck

624
00:24:49,679 --> 00:24:51,539
so sweet sport security is something you

625
00:24:51,539 --> 00:24:53,340
take into account

626
00:24:53,340 --> 00:24:55,620
ARP is also something to take into

627
00:24:55,620 --> 00:24:56,580
account

628
00:24:56,580 --> 00:24:59,419
because if additional measures are taken

629
00:24:59,419 --> 00:25:03,059
and some sort of weird harping is

630
00:25:03,059 --> 00:25:05,820
observed by whichever intuition

631
00:25:05,820 --> 00:25:07,440
detection system intrusion prevention

632
00:25:07,440 --> 00:25:08,880
system whichever

633
00:25:08,880 --> 00:25:11,520
you might trigger on-site security again

634
00:25:11,520 --> 00:25:13,740
depending on the level of security the

635
00:25:13,740 --> 00:25:15,900
company has implemented

636
00:25:15,900 --> 00:25:18,419
a good company can do a lot but it can't

637
00:25:18,419 --> 00:25:20,039
do anything because budget will

638
00:25:20,039 --> 00:25:22,380
Skyrocket very fast it's an exponential

639
00:25:22,380 --> 00:25:24,000
growth

640
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:26,520
that's the thing of rooting

641
00:25:26,520 --> 00:25:29,460
for example the client is supposed to be

642
00:25:29,460 --> 00:25:32,820
operational or otherwise if it's not

643
00:25:32,820 --> 00:25:33,779
going to

644
00:25:33,779 --> 00:25:36,000
remain on the network port for very long

645
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:38,159
well that's not a really big problem

646
00:25:38,159 --> 00:25:40,620
because if the port is authenticated and

647
00:25:40,620 --> 00:25:42,900
the clients disconnect

648
00:25:42,900 --> 00:25:44,640
the hacker device is still connected to

649
00:25:44,640 --> 00:25:46,080
the switchboard as long as they are

650
00:25:46,080 --> 00:25:49,260
linked the switch port

651
00:25:49,260 --> 00:25:51,299
depending on the setup design

652
00:25:51,299 --> 00:25:52,860
configuration Etc does not

653
00:25:52,860 --> 00:25:55,440
re-authenticate that often

654
00:25:55,440 --> 00:25:58,320
it might it might not but if you set it

655
00:25:58,320 --> 00:26:01,679
to re-authenticate every five minutes or

656
00:26:01,679 --> 00:26:02,460
so

657
00:26:02,460 --> 00:26:04,679
if you have a large extensive Campus of

658
00:26:04,679 --> 00:26:07,260
20 000 users it's going to generate a

659
00:26:07,260 --> 00:26:08,580
lot of traffic and you're going to need

660
00:26:08,580 --> 00:26:10,740
a very briefy radio server for that

661
00:26:10,740 --> 00:26:13,020
so timers are usually set this less

662
00:26:13,020 --> 00:26:14,100
strict

663
00:26:14,100 --> 00:26:17,100
but it might kick in

664
00:26:17,100 --> 00:26:20,340
then is the the Callback traffic if you

665
00:26:20,340 --> 00:26:21,900
want to initiate traffic from the Rogue

666
00:26:21,900 --> 00:26:24,779
device either towards the client or

667
00:26:24,779 --> 00:26:26,760
towards the rest of the network you're

668
00:26:26,760 --> 00:26:28,799
going to need an IP address

669
00:26:28,799 --> 00:26:30,840
if things like Dynamic ARP inspection

670
00:26:30,840 --> 00:26:33,179
are implemented you know the IP address

671
00:26:33,179 --> 00:26:35,039
because it lives on the client and we

672
00:26:35,039 --> 00:26:36,779
have to you want to use it from the

673
00:26:36,779 --> 00:26:38,520
hacker device as well you have to do

674
00:26:38,520 --> 00:26:40,860
some clever trickery

675
00:26:40,860 --> 00:26:42,360
see I've forgot one of the most

676
00:26:42,360 --> 00:26:45,000
interesting ones here this setup is

677
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:47,940
usually built upon a Linux Bridge

678
00:26:47,940 --> 00:26:49,980
Linux Bridge has been around for a while

679
00:26:49,980 --> 00:26:52,440
and it has changed quite a lot

680
00:26:52,440 --> 00:26:54,679
at the very beginning Linux bridging

681
00:26:54,679 --> 00:26:57,779
dropped EAP ol traffic

682
00:26:57,779 --> 00:26:59,460
it was actually a kernel packed to make

683
00:26:59,460 --> 00:27:01,860
it I think most more secure and more up

684
00:27:01,860 --> 00:27:03,059
to the standard

685
00:27:03,059 --> 00:27:05,159
but people who want to utilize this

686
00:27:05,159 --> 00:27:06,779
let's call them pen testers for the sake

687
00:27:06,779 --> 00:27:09,720
of they're the good guys they found out

688
00:27:09,720 --> 00:27:11,580
and they found out they could roll back

689
00:27:11,580 --> 00:27:14,580
a kernel patch which could add problems

690
00:27:14,580 --> 00:27:15,740
later

691
00:27:15,740 --> 00:27:19,020
or do some other trickery what they did

692
00:27:19,020 --> 00:27:20,100
both

693
00:27:20,100 --> 00:27:22,919
and I think part of the Linux bridging

694
00:27:22,919 --> 00:27:25,679
now lives in a user space and it's much

695
00:27:25,679 --> 00:27:27,960
easier to circumvent this shortcoming

696
00:27:27,960 --> 00:27:30,659
and it's actually possible to relatively

697
00:27:30,659 --> 00:27:33,960
easily allow EIP ol traffic to flow

698
00:27:33,960 --> 00:27:36,299
through a wireless bridge instead of it

699
00:27:36,299 --> 00:27:37,500
getting dropped which usually the

700
00:27:37,500 --> 00:27:38,760
default

701
00:27:38,760 --> 00:27:41,159
so a lot of smart people have done a lot

702
00:27:41,159 --> 00:27:43,500
of smart things that's why I added a

703
00:27:43,500 --> 00:27:44,820
credit slide at the end of this

704
00:27:44,820 --> 00:27:46,980
presentation because without all of

705
00:27:46,980 --> 00:27:49,080
their findings this would be a much

706
00:27:49,080 --> 00:27:51,620
shorter talk

707
00:27:52,200 --> 00:27:54,360
so one of the challenges is white gay

708
00:27:54,360 --> 00:27:56,700
use a white use case

709
00:27:56,700 --> 00:27:58,620
then there's the pen tester

710
00:27:58,620 --> 00:28:00,840
if it's going towards the desk or for

711
00:28:00,840 --> 00:28:02,700
example a secretary is going for lunch

712
00:28:02,700 --> 00:28:05,340
and he's going to need an hour to set it

713
00:28:05,340 --> 00:28:07,459
up

714
00:28:09,260 --> 00:28:12,059
gets spotted and is quoted out of the

715
00:28:12,059 --> 00:28:12,960
building

716
00:28:12,960 --> 00:28:16,740
so usually it's drop and leave and don't

717
00:28:16,740 --> 00:28:19,860
touch you usually don't have the time to

718
00:28:19,860 --> 00:28:21,659
fully configure it sometimes you get

719
00:28:21,659 --> 00:28:22,760
lucky

720
00:28:22,760 --> 00:28:25,559
you you do some dumpster diving you find

721
00:28:25,559 --> 00:28:27,059
a printout with the configuration

722
00:28:27,059 --> 00:28:28,799
settings of the printer including Mac

723
00:28:28,799 --> 00:28:32,400
addresses or pre-addressers Gateway Etc

724
00:28:32,400 --> 00:28:34,440
it all depends

725
00:28:34,440 --> 00:28:37,020
and there's automation one of the

726
00:28:37,020 --> 00:28:39,000
experts who I will credit at the end of

727
00:28:39,000 --> 00:28:41,580
the presentation did some Automation and

728
00:28:41,580 --> 00:28:43,440
their Bridge started down in a down

729
00:28:43,440 --> 00:28:45,360
state that means no traffic

730
00:28:45,360 --> 00:28:48,120
then it gets brought up then it sniffs a

731
00:28:48,120 --> 00:28:50,480
couple of packets

732
00:28:50,480 --> 00:28:53,100
actually gets the information it needs

733
00:28:53,100 --> 00:28:55,760
from the first packets then it

734
00:28:55,760 --> 00:28:57,960
reconfigures its own network breaching

735
00:28:57,960 --> 00:29:00,240
configuration with it restarts

736
00:29:00,240 --> 00:29:02,159
and then uses those parameters so the

737
00:29:02,159 --> 00:29:05,279
there's automation for the win

738
00:29:05,279 --> 00:29:07,020
then there's the phoning home you can

739
00:29:07,020 --> 00:29:08,940
for some reason allow some traffic in

740
00:29:08,940 --> 00:29:11,279
towards you running SSH server you can

741
00:29:11,279 --> 00:29:13,380
see where traffic out is or you can use

742
00:29:13,380 --> 00:29:15,659
a salary or Wi-Fi modem on the back

743
00:29:15,659 --> 00:29:18,360
it all has its ups and downs if you

744
00:29:18,360 --> 00:29:19,860
don't have

745
00:29:19,860 --> 00:29:22,020
close access to the device Wi-Fi is

746
00:29:22,020 --> 00:29:23,159
probably out

747
00:29:23,159 --> 00:29:27,720
the phone home inline or a dial back is

748
00:29:27,720 --> 00:29:30,000
usually a bit problematic because a

749
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:33,000
callback in from outside to inside it's

750
00:29:33,000 --> 00:29:35,760
rather rare to see inbound traffic

751
00:29:35,760 --> 00:29:38,039
allowed towards workstations

752
00:29:38,039 --> 00:29:40,980
and for good reason usually some

753
00:29:40,980 --> 00:29:42,179
internal hosts are allowed to

754
00:29:42,179 --> 00:29:43,740
communicate with workstations for

755
00:29:43,740 --> 00:29:45,799
example there's the management platform

756
00:29:45,799 --> 00:29:48,980
for mostly Windows environment

757
00:29:48,980 --> 00:29:51,840
those are usually allowed but from

758
00:29:51,840 --> 00:29:54,480
outside from internet forget it

759
00:29:54,480 --> 00:29:56,820
and phone home traffic does it that is

760
00:29:56,820 --> 00:29:58,679
initiated by the hacker device it also

761
00:29:58,679 --> 00:30:01,200
runs into a chance to get seen by

762
00:30:01,200 --> 00:30:03,360
firewall oh they think it's a commander

763
00:30:03,360 --> 00:30:05,340
control traffic they think it might be a

764
00:30:05,340 --> 00:30:07,740
bot they think it's passing through web

765
00:30:07,740 --> 00:30:11,460
proxy it gets hosted to uh

766
00:30:11,460 --> 00:30:14,039
um a machine generated DNS name there

767
00:30:14,039 --> 00:30:15,539
are all sorts of reason that it might

768
00:30:15,539 --> 00:30:17,880
attract attention

769
00:30:17,880 --> 00:30:20,460
so it really depends on what is the

770
00:30:20,460 --> 00:30:22,380
purpose of the probe do you want it to

771
00:30:22,380 --> 00:30:24,299
sniff traffic do you want to try and

772
00:30:24,299 --> 00:30:26,760
initiate an SSL traffic do you want to

773
00:30:26,760 --> 00:30:28,559
breach the host and make sure that

774
00:30:28,559 --> 00:30:30,480
there's an entry point there

775
00:30:30,480 --> 00:30:32,700
and there's also many many ways to

776
00:30:32,700 --> 00:30:34,860
prevent against any of this

777
00:30:34,860 --> 00:30:38,719
but it's going to get expensive

778
00:30:38,940 --> 00:30:40,380
in a nutshell

779
00:30:40,380 --> 00:30:43,140
all of these types of traffic depend on

780
00:30:43,140 --> 00:30:46,200
passing through Erp oil traffic through

781
00:30:46,200 --> 00:30:48,539
the Linux bridge between the actual

782
00:30:48,539 --> 00:30:49,919
client

783
00:30:49,919 --> 00:30:52,380
and the switchboard

784
00:30:52,380 --> 00:30:55,380
what's another easy way when this setup

785
00:30:55,380 --> 00:30:57,179
doesn't work well the workstation stays

786
00:30:57,179 --> 00:30:58,679
empty for the day there's a whole day

787
00:30:58,679 --> 00:30:59,880
without a switchboard getting

788
00:30:59,880 --> 00:31:01,080
authenticated

789
00:31:01,080 --> 00:31:04,939
you do need a legitimate client

790
00:31:07,980 --> 00:31:10,620
it's not the end of the slide but first

791
00:31:10,620 --> 00:31:12,480
the credits I mentioned

792
00:31:12,480 --> 00:31:14,279
there's a couple of people who did some

793
00:31:14,279 --> 00:31:16,679
talks at Defcon that were a major

794
00:31:16,679 --> 00:31:19,260
inspiration to this talk if you want to

795
00:31:19,260 --> 00:31:21,059
know more in depth about it I should

796
00:31:21,059 --> 00:31:23,399
just just take a picture of the slide go

797
00:31:23,399 --> 00:31:24,960
find them the the movies are on YouTube

798
00:31:24,960 --> 00:31:27,059
there's something between 45 minutes and

799
00:31:27,059 --> 00:31:29,940
60 and one and a half hours or something

800
00:31:29,940 --> 00:31:32,700
and they really go in depth into the uh

801
00:31:32,700 --> 00:31:34,440
the matter also have here some

802
00:31:34,440 --> 00:31:36,120
demonstrations some more successful than

803
00:31:36,120 --> 00:31:38,100
others it's one of the other reasons I

804
00:31:38,100 --> 00:31:39,659
usually don't demo because the demo

805
00:31:39,659 --> 00:31:41,520
girls hate me

806
00:31:41,520 --> 00:31:44,039
there's a Gabriel Solstice Ryan who did

807
00:31:44,039 --> 00:31:45,600
an excellent presentation on a decent

808
00:31:45,600 --> 00:31:48,480
tool Alpha duck will wrote one of the

809
00:31:48,480 --> 00:31:50,120
best functioning

810
00:31:50,120 --> 00:31:52,860
probes is actually working as a pen test

811
00:31:52,860 --> 00:31:54,480
and it developed his own tool including

812
00:31:54,480 --> 00:31:57,620
the automation I mentioned

813
00:31:57,860 --> 00:32:01,260
is creator of Fenris sorry fenwir one of

814
00:32:01,260 --> 00:32:03,740
the most recent

815
00:32:03,740 --> 00:32:07,080
802.1 X tooling I'll go step aside and

816
00:32:07,080 --> 00:32:09,200
see a couple of people using a camera

817
00:32:09,200 --> 00:32:13,799
there's a d-stike an ESP Enthusiast who

818
00:32:13,799 --> 00:32:16,559
is responsible for uh making the basis

819
00:32:16,559 --> 00:32:18,679
of that awesome watch you saw

820
00:32:18,679 --> 00:32:21,380
paftrinos did a wonderful

821
00:32:21,380 --> 00:32:24,539
presentation on 802.1x how to secure it

822
00:32:24,539 --> 00:32:27,299
and how to uh what's what's what to

823
00:32:27,299 --> 00:32:31,320
watch for uh to uh to spot breaking and

824
00:32:31,320 --> 00:32:34,440
easily to hack stuff and that's Mark

825
00:32:34,440 --> 00:32:37,320
Simon he was the only name I found

826
00:32:37,320 --> 00:32:39,360
for the IEEE with relations to the

827
00:32:39,360 --> 00:32:41,700
creation of 802.1x there might be more

828
00:32:41,700 --> 00:32:43,500
but I wasn't able to found them within

829
00:32:43,500 --> 00:32:46,880
five minutes and then I got bored

830
00:32:48,419 --> 00:32:50,220
okay a lot of people especially

831
00:32:50,220 --> 00:32:51,840
management don't want to see this one

832
00:32:51,840 --> 00:32:53,940
it's a couple of harsh truth

833
00:32:53,940 --> 00:32:56,940
it will cost a lot

834
00:32:56,940 --> 00:32:58,559
it'll cost even more if you're up

835
00:32:58,559 --> 00:33:01,020
against a state actor

836
00:33:01,020 --> 00:33:03,179
most of the people here in the room said

837
00:33:03,179 --> 00:33:04,440
if you're working for the Dutch

838
00:33:04,440 --> 00:33:06,620
government

839
00:33:07,320 --> 00:33:09,600
you're going to fit in the first

840
00:33:09,600 --> 00:33:10,799
category

841
00:33:10,799 --> 00:33:12,899
there's budget constraints

842
00:33:12,899 --> 00:33:14,880
and chances are you will be up against a

843
00:33:14,880 --> 00:33:16,919
state actor are a bit higher than for

844
00:33:16,919 --> 00:33:18,960
the average Enterprise

845
00:33:18,960 --> 00:33:21,899
keep in mind will happen

846
00:33:21,899 --> 00:33:24,059
mattress authentication bypass is a

847
00:33:24,059 --> 00:33:27,120
famous One Like I said it supports 802.1

848
00:33:27,120 --> 00:33:30,360
X but doesn't support the right a22

849
00:33:30,360 --> 00:33:32,220
phonics implementation

850
00:33:32,220 --> 00:33:35,700
cameras are also an attack point because

851
00:33:35,700 --> 00:33:37,200
they usually

852
00:33:37,200 --> 00:33:39,659
are an afterthought and they're usually

853
00:33:39,659 --> 00:33:41,279
not even part of the facility management

854
00:33:41,279 --> 00:33:43,679
procurement process they usually part

855
00:33:43,679 --> 00:33:45,840
of the security process

856
00:33:45,840 --> 00:33:48,899
and most security companies especially

857
00:33:48,899 --> 00:33:51,120
when it's concerning physical security

858
00:33:51,120 --> 00:33:53,220
they don't know anything about

859
00:33:53,220 --> 00:33:55,320
networking except hey this is network

860
00:33:55,320 --> 00:33:57,360
camera I need Network

861
00:33:57,360 --> 00:33:59,519
and whether we're not it gets plugged in

862
00:33:59,519 --> 00:34:00,960
I just need outside Internet it's

863
00:34:00,960 --> 00:34:03,620
managed from the cloud

864
00:34:03,960 --> 00:34:05,640
I have stories to tell you never mind

865
00:34:05,640 --> 00:34:06,659
this

866
00:34:06,659 --> 00:34:10,139
um in short they usually depend on an

867
00:34:10,139 --> 00:34:12,179
extremely high amount of ports going to

868
00:34:12,179 --> 00:34:14,639
outside usually to Cloud instances you

869
00:34:14,639 --> 00:34:16,800
can't even limit the amount of

870
00:34:16,800 --> 00:34:18,899
destination IP addresses because it's

871
00:34:18,899 --> 00:34:20,280
the cloud

872
00:34:20,280 --> 00:34:22,859
you blink an eye DNS get re-rooted and

873
00:34:22,859 --> 00:34:26,598
it needs to go to Northern IP address

874
00:34:27,119 --> 00:34:29,219
having a better lock than your neighbors

875
00:34:29,219 --> 00:34:30,359
does help

876
00:34:30,359 --> 00:34:32,460
for a while

877
00:34:32,460 --> 00:34:34,139
if you're up to speed you have decent

878
00:34:34,139 --> 00:34:36,480
Security in place you're on a large a

879
00:34:36,480 --> 00:34:38,580
Terrain with lots of facilities lots of

880
00:34:38,580 --> 00:34:41,520
buildings you limit your Wi-Fi from uh

881
00:34:41,520 --> 00:34:43,020
not going too far outside of the

882
00:34:43,020 --> 00:34:44,719
building

883
00:34:44,719 --> 00:34:47,399
you don't have that many crown jewels

884
00:34:47,399 --> 00:34:48,839
that are digital for example they're

885
00:34:48,839 --> 00:34:51,418
physical and a lot tight

886
00:34:51,418 --> 00:34:55,199
it's also a thing that may help

887
00:34:55,199 --> 00:34:58,800
postpone you getting hacked for a while

888
00:34:58,800 --> 00:35:01,500
at a certain point of time you're if

889
00:35:01,500 --> 00:35:03,859
you're not keeping up you become the the

890
00:35:03,859 --> 00:35:07,619
Target that people will do need to do

891
00:35:07,619 --> 00:35:09,900
the least amount of effort for to get

892
00:35:09,900 --> 00:35:11,520
the best results

893
00:35:11,520 --> 00:35:14,099
and this also doesn't help

894
00:35:14,099 --> 00:35:16,619
for the preparation it helps afterwards

895
00:35:16,619 --> 00:35:19,740
prepare to be hacked just make sure that

896
00:35:19,740 --> 00:35:22,619
you know what to do if you get hacked

897
00:35:22,619 --> 00:35:25,079
sure it's a bit unpredictable but you

898
00:35:25,079 --> 00:35:27,240
can't think of it beforehand you can

899
00:35:27,240 --> 00:35:29,460
have playbooks

900
00:35:29,460 --> 00:35:31,560
someone got the main admin

901
00:35:31,560 --> 00:35:34,680
someone reads their Wi-Fi someone took

902
00:35:34,680 --> 00:35:36,420
off with a server

903
00:35:36,420 --> 00:35:39,180
all of those things you can think of

904
00:35:39,180 --> 00:35:40,859
them beforehand

905
00:35:40,859 --> 00:35:43,440
you can write playbooks you can review

906
00:35:43,440 --> 00:35:46,560
the playbox every once in a while you

907
00:35:46,560 --> 00:35:48,660
can dream up more playbooks you can

908
00:35:48,660 --> 00:35:50,880
deviate from playbooks it says this

909
00:35:50,880 --> 00:35:53,280
looks very much like Playbook 5 but with

910
00:35:53,280 --> 00:35:55,320
a small twist fine we'll grab the

911
00:35:55,320 --> 00:35:56,940
Playbook we're going to adapt as we go

912
00:35:56,940 --> 00:36:00,320
but we do have a solid basis

913
00:36:02,579 --> 00:36:04,980
there are fortunately some mitigating

914
00:36:04,980 --> 00:36:07,460
measures

915
00:36:08,040 --> 00:36:09,839
one of them is Design Network

916
00:36:09,839 --> 00:36:12,180
segmentation for example the printer

917
00:36:12,180 --> 00:36:14,760
port I mentioned if all your printers

918
00:36:14,760 --> 00:36:17,880
are on a separate network with only

919
00:36:17,880 --> 00:36:21,420
allowing access from the printer spooler

920
00:36:21,420 --> 00:36:24,180
to the printer you're in good shape

921
00:36:24,180 --> 00:36:26,280
of course it doesn't work that way

922
00:36:26,280 --> 00:36:28,140
because there's some process automation

923
00:36:28,140 --> 00:36:29,880
who needs an app direct appear just for

924
00:36:29,880 --> 00:36:31,200
the printer in order to print the daily

925
00:36:31,200 --> 00:36:33,720
reports so you need and where is it

926
00:36:33,720 --> 00:36:35,339
located oh is it located in that subnet

927
00:36:35,339 --> 00:36:37,380
so it's usually get

928
00:36:37,380 --> 00:36:38,940
brought up a bit

929
00:36:38,940 --> 00:36:40,619
then that's the training and user

930
00:36:40,619 --> 00:36:42,839
security awareness

931
00:36:42,839 --> 00:36:45,300
if users know

932
00:36:45,300 --> 00:36:47,700
that there shouldn't be a knock under

933
00:36:47,700 --> 00:36:49,859
their desk

934
00:36:49,859 --> 00:36:52,140
and if people are told it could be a

935
00:36:52,140 --> 00:36:55,200
tech if you see something odd report it

936
00:36:55,200 --> 00:36:57,780
as soon as you can don't wait till after

937
00:36:57,780 --> 00:36:59,760
lunch lunch can wait

938
00:36:59,760 --> 00:37:03,180
user awareness especially this being a

939
00:37:03,180 --> 00:37:04,800
mostly physical attack

940
00:37:04,800 --> 00:37:07,680
the reason I set an asterisk there was

941
00:37:07,680 --> 00:37:09,839
Wi-Fi there's also a Wi-Fi point of view

942
00:37:09,839 --> 00:37:12,780
and with good antenna you can be a long

943
00:37:12,780 --> 00:37:14,220
time off

944
00:37:14,220 --> 00:37:15,320
still

945
00:37:15,320 --> 00:37:19,579
be somewhat vulnerable to this attack

946
00:37:19,579 --> 00:37:21,900
in essence is still a physical attack

947
00:37:21,900 --> 00:37:23,760
you can't attack someone from 100

948
00:37:23,760 --> 00:37:25,619
kilometers away

949
00:37:25,619 --> 00:37:28,440
but you probably can't pull it off 100

950
00:37:28,440 --> 00:37:31,079
meters away

951
00:37:31,079 --> 00:37:33,720
this is um

952
00:37:33,720 --> 00:37:36,000
training security awareness it's a very

953
00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:37,500
important one especially facility

954
00:37:37,500 --> 00:37:39,359
management and other people who purchase

955
00:37:39,359 --> 00:37:41,400
equipment that gets plugged into the

956
00:37:41,400 --> 00:37:42,300
network

957
00:37:42,300 --> 00:37:44,820
all right it gets completely segmented

958
00:37:44,820 --> 00:37:46,740
off without any exception for example

959
00:37:46,740 --> 00:37:49,320
the printer situation or the IP camera

960
00:37:49,320 --> 00:37:51,839
situation or whatever situation

961
00:37:51,839 --> 00:37:53,700
or is it going to adhere to the

962
00:37:53,700 --> 00:37:56,700
standards that were startup implemented

963
00:37:56,700 --> 00:38:00,960
regularly reviewed updated and tested

964
00:38:00,960 --> 00:38:02,579
and then you can get usually can get

965
00:38:02,579 --> 00:38:03,900
away with the property implementation

966
00:38:03,900 --> 00:38:06,300
and there it is again logging and

967
00:38:06,300 --> 00:38:08,820
reading them you don't need to see every

968
00:38:08,820 --> 00:38:11,700
time a switchboard goes up and down but

969
00:38:11,700 --> 00:38:13,980
the switch Port security kicks in or a

970
00:38:13,980 --> 00:38:17,700
probe or your ethernet monitoring or

971
00:38:17,700 --> 00:38:19,800
your network management solution or your

972
00:38:19,800 --> 00:38:22,980
its or IDs or IPS kicks in

973
00:38:22,980 --> 00:38:25,440
you may want to look at it

974
00:38:25,440 --> 00:38:27,599
and you may want to look at it faster it

975
00:38:27,599 --> 00:38:28,980
doesn't mean every company should have

976
00:38:28,980 --> 00:38:30,300
their own socket their own Security

977
00:38:30,300 --> 00:38:32,760
operation Center but they feel important

978
00:38:32,760 --> 00:38:35,520
enough it might not hurt

979
00:38:35,520 --> 00:38:38,160
then there's multiple security tabs and

980
00:38:38,160 --> 00:38:39,660
layered security

981
00:38:39,660 --> 00:38:41,880
if you have a building that everyone can

982
00:38:41,880 --> 00:38:44,280
walk into and you have a door for

983
00:38:44,280 --> 00:38:47,060
example like this one

984
00:38:49,560 --> 00:38:52,460
with a large gap

985
00:38:52,859 --> 00:38:55,500
I can see some room for improvements

986
00:38:55,500 --> 00:38:58,020
make sure the security is layered on

987
00:38:58,020 --> 00:39:00,240
every level make sure not everyone can

988
00:39:00,240 --> 00:39:02,280
enter the building or gets close to the

989
00:39:02,280 --> 00:39:04,800
network equipment gets close to users

990
00:39:04,800 --> 00:39:06,180
because this is an attack that can

991
00:39:06,180 --> 00:39:07,740
perfectly be done without even seeing

992
00:39:07,740 --> 00:39:09,960
the switch you just need need to go

993
00:39:09,960 --> 00:39:12,420
somewhere that's between users and

994
00:39:12,420 --> 00:39:14,339
switch and whether that's a cable tree

995
00:39:14,339 --> 00:39:17,400
or a wiring closet or a satellite

996
00:39:17,400 --> 00:39:18,660
equipment room

997
00:39:18,660 --> 00:39:20,339
if you're in between then you have

998
00:39:20,339 --> 00:39:22,500
something to that you can pull off

999
00:39:22,500 --> 00:39:24,980
physical security is remarkably

1000
00:39:24,980 --> 00:39:27,900
important for physically based attacks

1001
00:39:27,900 --> 00:39:29,700
and then there's of course the layered

1002
00:39:29,700 --> 00:39:32,400
security if you have 802.1x mate it

1003
00:39:32,400 --> 00:39:34,619
doesn't substitute all the other things

1004
00:39:34,619 --> 00:39:36,599
of security you can do that's the port

1005
00:39:36,599 --> 00:39:38,099
security there's Access Control list

1006
00:39:38,099 --> 00:39:40,079
there's fire warning this IDs tires IPS

1007
00:39:40,079 --> 00:39:42,960
it usually is a combination of all these

1008
00:39:42,960 --> 00:39:46,500
things that make a network more secure

1009
00:39:46,500 --> 00:39:49,200
then there's tunneling

1010
00:39:49,200 --> 00:39:52,320
it's also I want to point back to the

1011
00:39:52,320 --> 00:39:54,359
very first one design

1012
00:39:54,359 --> 00:39:56,339
I see it don't buy a lot of companies

1013
00:39:56,339 --> 00:39:58,560
these days they say all our clients are

1014
00:39:58,560 --> 00:39:59,880
interested

1015
00:39:59,880 --> 00:40:01,560
we're going still going to isolate them

1016
00:40:01,560 --> 00:40:02,640
from each other

1017
00:40:02,640 --> 00:40:05,160
where they get internet access or they

1018
00:40:05,160 --> 00:40:06,839
get allowed

1019
00:40:06,839 --> 00:40:10,020
to initiate an SSL VPN with multi-factor

1020
00:40:10,020 --> 00:40:11,940
Authentication

1021
00:40:11,940 --> 00:40:14,060
so we're not even going to bother with

1022
00:40:14,060 --> 00:40:16,140
802.1x and the only thing it's allowed

1023
00:40:16,140 --> 00:40:19,020
to do is initiate an SSL VPN

1024
00:40:19,020 --> 00:40:21,599
and then there's nothing going to and

1025
00:40:21,599 --> 00:40:23,700
from the wired or Wireless networking

1026
00:40:23,700 --> 00:40:25,320
that you can learn anything about

1027
00:40:25,320 --> 00:40:26,820
because it's usually encrypted

1028
00:40:26,820 --> 00:40:28,380
especially when coupled with proper

1029
00:40:28,380 --> 00:40:30,300
certificate management

1030
00:40:30,300 --> 00:40:33,000
it might be easy to set up a SSL vbn

1031
00:40:33,000 --> 00:40:34,440
concentrator

1032
00:40:34,440 --> 00:40:37,800
than to implement a full-blown 802.1x

1033
00:40:37,800 --> 00:40:40,680
implementation it all depends

1034
00:40:40,680 --> 00:40:42,359
then there's of course

1035
00:40:42,359 --> 00:40:45,720
the behavioral indication of compromise

1036
00:40:45,720 --> 00:40:48,660
which can run as an antivirus or

1037
00:40:48,660 --> 00:40:50,700
whatever product on your workstation on

1038
00:40:50,700 --> 00:40:52,020
your server

1039
00:40:52,020 --> 00:40:54,660
and it says why is this client

1040
00:40:54,660 --> 00:40:57,119
performing a port scan why is it trying

1041
00:40:57,119 --> 00:40:59,040
to start some application I don't want

1042
00:40:59,040 --> 00:41:01,619
it to to start

1043
00:41:01,619 --> 00:41:03,660
it can be as simple as starting a

1044
00:41:03,660 --> 00:41:05,880
process that's known on a workstation

1045
00:41:05,880 --> 00:41:08,400
behavioral indication of compromise why

1046
00:41:08,400 --> 00:41:10,440
is that engineer trying to contact the

1047
00:41:10,440 --> 00:41:12,180
finance server

1048
00:41:12,180 --> 00:41:14,160
all of these

1049
00:41:14,160 --> 00:41:16,140
can be done on multiple places in the

1050
00:41:16,140 --> 00:41:17,400
network

1051
00:41:17,400 --> 00:41:19,320
it's usually more the more place you

1052
00:41:19,320 --> 00:41:21,000
want to implement the more expensive and

1053
00:41:21,000 --> 00:41:23,280
complex it's going to be

1054
00:41:23,280 --> 00:41:25,200
it's a major part of your total security

1055
00:41:25,200 --> 00:41:28,320
posture those ideas IPS maybe even a

1056
00:41:28,320 --> 00:41:31,320
sock and there's of course just throw

1057
00:41:31,320 --> 00:41:32,820
enough money against it and it'll

1058
00:41:32,820 --> 00:41:34,440
probably limit the chances you get

1059
00:41:34,440 --> 00:41:37,980
breached but not everyone is I.T at this

1060
00:41:37,980 --> 00:41:41,160
core business so there's nothing wrong

1061
00:41:41,160 --> 00:41:43,079
with getting outside help

1062
00:41:43,079 --> 00:41:45,000
just make sure you have your

1063
00:41:45,000 --> 00:41:46,560
requirements in order you know what you

1064
00:41:46,560 --> 00:41:48,599
want you make sure that all the relevant

1065
00:41:48,599 --> 00:41:51,260
people are part of the process

1066
00:41:51,260 --> 00:41:54,060
and you make sure you go with a

1067
00:41:54,060 --> 00:41:55,920
Dependable organization and you can

1068
00:41:55,920 --> 00:41:57,540
easily go for outside support for

1069
00:41:57,540 --> 00:41:59,940
management security operations center

1070
00:41:59,940 --> 00:42:03,540
and similar the ways to make sure that

1071
00:42:03,540 --> 00:42:05,880
your network and security posture gets

1072
00:42:05,880 --> 00:42:08,579
improved without doing every single one

1073
00:42:08,579 --> 00:42:11,220
yourself including hiring the people who

1074
00:42:11,220 --> 00:42:13,759
want to do that

1075
00:42:13,859 --> 00:42:15,960
now for the most intriguing question of

1076
00:42:15,960 --> 00:42:19,400
them all are there any questions

1077
00:42:23,099 --> 00:42:25,700
sure

1078
00:42:28,260 --> 00:42:31,140
between protecting the perimeter in the

1079
00:42:31,140 --> 00:42:34,560
last list with mitigations are going

1080
00:42:34,560 --> 00:42:37,460
to processes

1081
00:42:37,680 --> 00:42:39,660
exploration

1082
00:42:39,660 --> 00:42:41,040
okay sure

1083
00:42:41,040 --> 00:42:41,640
um

1084
00:42:41,640 --> 00:42:43,020
you initially talked about network

1085
00:42:43,020 --> 00:42:45,060
access control which is protecting the

1086
00:42:45,060 --> 00:42:48,480
premises and the gate around the

1087
00:42:48,480 --> 00:42:49,859
internal Network

1088
00:42:49,859 --> 00:42:53,460
and the list of mitigating measures were

1089
00:42:53,460 --> 00:42:56,579
more about internal segmentation process

1090
00:42:56,579 --> 00:42:58,500
that one yeah tooling Etc

1091
00:42:58,500 --> 00:43:02,180
but do you see a trend into more

1092
00:43:02,180 --> 00:43:05,339
Management on the endpoint like for

1093
00:43:05,339 --> 00:43:08,460
example centrally managing and also

1094
00:43:08,460 --> 00:43:11,280
actively the Windows File on endpoints

1095
00:43:11,280 --> 00:43:13,560
not only for inbound connections but

1096
00:43:13,560 --> 00:43:16,380
also outbound connections so you can do

1097
00:43:16,380 --> 00:43:18,619
like a bit of micro segmentation

1098
00:43:18,619 --> 00:43:21,900
centrally managed on the endpoint

1099
00:43:21,900 --> 00:43:24,900
oh I hear two things here one is is a

1100
00:43:24,900 --> 00:43:28,020
proper endpoint security which includes

1101
00:43:28,020 --> 00:43:31,220
one or another flavor of

1102
00:43:31,220 --> 00:43:34,079
agent usually and whether or not it's an

1103
00:43:34,079 --> 00:43:36,780
antivirus agent or doing more there are

1104
00:43:36,780 --> 00:43:39,000
products that's got I'm not going to to

1105
00:43:39,000 --> 00:43:40,440
make this into a commercial or sales

1106
00:43:40,440 --> 00:43:42,599
pitch but our products that do both

1107
00:43:42,599 --> 00:43:44,660
antivirus and do some behavioral

1108
00:43:44,660 --> 00:43:47,760
analysis and they block process pure on

1109
00:43:47,760 --> 00:43:49,380
it because that you shouldn't do that

1110
00:43:49,380 --> 00:43:51,480
and then it really blocks it that's one

1111
00:43:51,480 --> 00:43:53,880
you should implement it but depending on

1112
00:43:53,880 --> 00:43:57,420
a scope budget Etc I'm not really at

1113
00:43:57,420 --> 00:43:59,819
place to uh to advise anything and micro

1114
00:43:59,819 --> 00:44:03,240
segmentation can be done but it's

1115
00:44:03,240 --> 00:44:05,220
usually uh called for as a Data Center

1116
00:44:05,220 --> 00:44:08,700
Technology but with a few simple things

1117
00:44:08,700 --> 00:44:10,319
here you know what to do you can for

1118
00:44:10,319 --> 00:44:12,660
example use a VLAN Access Control list

1119
00:44:12,660 --> 00:44:14,520
in combination with some Access Control

1120
00:44:14,520 --> 00:44:15,780
list and with the field and extra

1121
00:44:15,780 --> 00:44:17,579
control is you make sure that traffic

1122
00:44:17,579 --> 00:44:19,319
with any Vlog between clients is not

1123
00:44:19,319 --> 00:44:22,380
allowed and certain clients only get

1124
00:44:22,380 --> 00:44:24,380
access to a certain other

1125
00:44:24,380 --> 00:44:27,000
networks and the combination of those

1126
00:44:27,000 --> 00:44:30,180
two are relatively lightweight if you

1127
00:44:30,180 --> 00:44:32,300
design them properly there's also scale

1128
00:44:32,300 --> 00:44:35,339
and without even using Data Center a

1129
00:44:35,339 --> 00:44:37,560
great equipment you can still Implement

1130
00:44:37,560 --> 00:44:41,579
micro segmentation at the client level

1131
00:44:41,579 --> 00:44:43,319
it really depends it should be a

1132
00:44:43,319 --> 00:44:45,480
combination of both a user age user

1133
00:44:45,480 --> 00:44:47,339
desktop protection and endpoint

1134
00:44:47,339 --> 00:44:50,660
protection and a network

1135
00:44:50,660 --> 00:44:53,160
protection for example the segmentation

1136
00:44:53,160 --> 00:44:56,220
and you couldn't put it back as small as

1137
00:44:56,220 --> 00:44:57,960
micro segmentation

1138
00:44:57,960 --> 00:45:00,300
so the client says only allowed to talk

1139
00:45:00,300 --> 00:45:02,040
with the Gateway on an Ethernet level

1140
00:45:02,040 --> 00:45:04,560
and only attack allowed to talk to

1141
00:45:04,560 --> 00:45:06,720
certain servers associated with the

1142
00:45:06,720 --> 00:45:08,640
function usually if you answer function

1143
00:45:08,640 --> 00:45:10,260
derived

1144
00:45:10,260 --> 00:45:12,480
uh at the data center and not anything

1145
00:45:12,480 --> 00:45:14,700
out of that in fact you can even say for

1146
00:45:14,700 --> 00:45:16,619
Envy if it tries anything else raise an

1147
00:45:16,619 --> 00:45:20,160
alert by simply logging anything that it

1148
00:45:20,160 --> 00:45:21,720
wants to do that's outside of the scope

1149
00:45:21,720 --> 00:45:24,180
of the design

1150
00:45:24,180 --> 00:45:26,220
thanks

1151
00:45:26,220 --> 00:45:29,180
any more questions

1152
00:45:32,819 --> 00:45:35,900
are you still awake

1153
00:45:39,900 --> 00:45:42,599
just a few seconds please

1154
00:45:42,599 --> 00:45:45,140
thanks

1155
00:45:48,839 --> 00:45:53,460
maybe an odd one but we shouldn't forget

1156
00:45:53,460 --> 00:45:54,560
our

1157
00:45:54,560 --> 00:45:58,020
list at least thought but most

1158
00:45:58,020 --> 00:46:01,800
used networks our home networks what can

1159
00:46:01,800 --> 00:46:04,160
we do

1160
00:46:05,760 --> 00:46:07,740
well aside from me and a few colleagues

1161
00:46:07,740 --> 00:46:11,460
we don't have 82.1x implemented

1162
00:46:11,460 --> 00:46:14,720
um what you can do

1163
00:46:17,400 --> 00:46:20,040
the the bad thing news I have the best

1164
00:46:20,040 --> 00:46:23,099
you can do is also training so make sure

1165
00:46:23,099 --> 00:46:24,960
you know what to buy you know how to use

1166
00:46:24,960 --> 00:46:28,140
it and when you you usually have don't

1167
00:46:28,140 --> 00:46:31,740
have many millions in Digital Data uh

1168
00:46:31,740 --> 00:46:33,900
located at your home at least I hope not

1169
00:46:33,900 --> 00:46:36,900
but the solution should fit the purpose

1170
00:46:36,900 --> 00:46:40,140
and for a home network the the the bar

1171
00:46:40,140 --> 00:46:42,420
usually isn't as high as for the

1172
00:46:42,420 --> 00:46:44,220
scenario company I placed at the

1173
00:46:44,220 --> 00:46:46,680
beginning of this presentation but open

1174
00:46:46,680 --> 00:46:50,160
wi-fi is usually a bad idea preset K is

1175
00:46:50,160 --> 00:46:52,619
probably best used uh it's a small

1176
00:46:52,619 --> 00:46:55,800
things I mean we're all hackers here so

1177
00:46:55,800 --> 00:46:57,900
if you have a sign in your hallway

1178
00:46:57,900 --> 00:47:00,960
that's readable from outside with your

1179
00:47:00,960 --> 00:47:02,700
Wi-Fi password is probably not a good

1180
00:47:02,700 --> 00:47:05,000
idea

1181
00:47:05,280 --> 00:47:07,500
but if you can have it as far as best as

1182
00:47:07,500 --> 00:47:09,660
and at the inside of your front door to

1183
00:47:09,660 --> 00:47:10,980
make sure it's not visible from the

1184
00:47:10,980 --> 00:47:13,020
outside but it's still easily available

1185
00:47:13,020 --> 00:47:14,819
for people putting down the jackets oh

1186
00:47:14,819 --> 00:47:16,619
that's the Wi-Fi password

1187
00:47:16,619 --> 00:47:19,319
another good one of course is not to

1188
00:47:19,319 --> 00:47:21,180
make it too difficult but also not make

1189
00:47:21,180 --> 00:47:24,180
it too easy so no reuse no make it

1190
00:47:24,180 --> 00:47:25,619
welcome

1191
00:47:25,619 --> 00:47:26,520
um

1192
00:47:26,520 --> 00:47:31,200
maybe change it a couple of times a year

1193
00:47:31,200 --> 00:47:32,819
what's the worst that could happen that

1194
00:47:32,819 --> 00:47:35,160
people need to ask for the Wi-Fi

1195
00:47:35,160 --> 00:47:37,440
password when they visit you again

1196
00:47:37,440 --> 00:47:39,359
It's usually the small stuff that

1197
00:47:39,359 --> 00:47:43,079
prevents the big hassle this is also a

1198
00:47:43,079 --> 00:47:45,780
specifically aimed at accessing a

1199
00:47:45,780 --> 00:47:46,800
network

1200
00:47:46,800 --> 00:47:48,980
and usually

1201
00:47:48,980 --> 00:47:51,119
except when you're doing a long party

1202
00:47:51,119 --> 00:47:54,740
most of the access on the um

1203
00:47:54,740 --> 00:47:58,200
on the home network is done by Wi-Fi and

1204
00:47:58,200 --> 00:48:00,780
quite a few Solutions now also support

1205
00:48:00,780 --> 00:48:03,300
guest networks that allow for internet

1206
00:48:03,300 --> 00:48:06,240
access but no access to your local NASA

1207
00:48:06,240 --> 00:48:07,680
or whatever

1208
00:48:07,680 --> 00:48:09,660
so make sure what you're doing think

1209
00:48:09,660 --> 00:48:12,599
about it do a bit of research and then

1210
00:48:12,599 --> 00:48:14,099
just implement the best traffic and of

1211
00:48:14,099 --> 00:48:15,660
course what everybody keeps telling here

1212
00:48:15,660 --> 00:48:17,400
especially from an iot point of view

1213
00:48:17,400 --> 00:48:19,740
keep the stuff updated

1214
00:48:19,740 --> 00:48:22,200
it's sometimes it's as simple as simple

1215
00:48:22,200 --> 00:48:24,500
as it

1216
00:48:25,140 --> 00:48:28,640
you're welcome any more questions

1217
00:48:32,160 --> 00:48:33,660
no

1218
00:48:33,660 --> 00:48:35,819
then he would like you to thank you for

1219
00:48:35,819 --> 00:48:37,440
everyone for attending here I didn't

1220
00:48:37,440 --> 00:48:39,300
really expect such a massive turnup

1221
00:48:39,300 --> 00:48:43,520
thank you for that and enjoy the rest

1222
00:48:44,280 --> 00:48:47,960
foreign foreign
