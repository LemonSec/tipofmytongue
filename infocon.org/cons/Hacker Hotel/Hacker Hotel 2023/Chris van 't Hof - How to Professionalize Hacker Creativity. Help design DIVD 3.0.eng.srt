13
00:00:29,880 --> 00:00:32,279
a joke is all that is just your

14
00:00:32,279 --> 00:00:34,320

22
00:00:51,840 --> 00:00:54,379
rules organize things

23
00:00:54,379 --> 00:00:56,960

[ __ ] but that is never allowed and then I never

26
00:01:02,100 --> 00:01:04,440

very dangerous work but for the rest

110
00:04:32,940 --> 00:04:34,620
of the world as a voluntary because you

121
00:04:59,220 --> 00:05:01,500
research and

122
00:05:01,500 --> 00:05:03,500
finally eh last year

123
00:05:03,500 --> 00:05:07,080
176,000 people reported from Hey I mean

124
00:05:07,080 --> 00:05:09,919
you have to

125
00:05:10,979 --> 00:05:14,180
ask this for or still

126
00:05:16,560 --> 00:05:19,080
yes for people who are in the profession eh

127
00:05:19,080 --> 00:05:21,320
This is now the 10th anniversary of

128
00:05:21,320 --> 00:05:23,699
coordinated funerality Disclosure which was

129
00:05:23,699 --> 00:05:25,740
still called responsible so close 10 years ago

130
00:05:25,740 --> 00:05:27,840
and for the people who

131
00:05:27,840 --> 00:05:29,340
haven't experienced it until then it was

132
00:05:29,340 --> 00:05:30,840
quite exciting if you found hacking What

133
00:05:30,840 --> 00:05:32,940
and then you went to report says Hey you

134
00:05:32,940 --> 00:05:34,919
're leaking You have to do what they Pleur up

135
00:05:34,919 --> 00:05:36,360
or do I know what and then I think yes  that

136
00:05:36,360 --> 00:05:38,039
's not possible patient data Well I'm going to

137
00:05:38,039 --> 00:05:41,039
publish well lawsuits hassle [ __ ]

138
00:05:41,039 --> 00:05:43,380
uh so they came up with a guideline like yes

139
00:05:43,380 --> 00:05:46,560
how do you do that neatly huh Then

140
00:05:46,560 --> 00:05:48,960
when you investigate something I do

141
00:05:48,960 --> 00:05:50,580
n't think he's going to enjoy too deep in the system

142
00:05:50,580 --> 00:05:52,380
a lot of downloading things are going to

143
00:05:52,380 --> 00:05:54,840
break backdoor they are installing thank

144
00:05:54,840 --> 00:05:56,820
you Best flag of an organization that is having

145
00:05:56,820 --> 00:05:58,680
someone who is saying thank you

146
00:05:58,680 --> 00:06:01,020
We are going to do something with it and all those

147
00:06:01,020 --> 00:06:02,460
organizations were you get a report of

148
00:06:02,460 --> 00:06:04,919
hacker type before you participate huh um

149
00:06:04,919 --> 00:06:07,860
am  not the hard one because they are there to

150
00:06:07,860 --> 00:06:09,300
help you

151
00:06:09,300 --> 00:06:12,680
so that's quite a milestone but eh

152
00:06:12,680 --> 00:06:15,660
for this story this is actually

153
00:06:15,660 --> 00:06:18,300
much more important

154
00:06:18,300 --> 00:06:20,160
because the public prosecutor where all those

155
00:06:20,160 --> 00:06:21,900
prosecutors were and all those All

156
00:06:21,900 --> 00:06:23,880
those cases they got they  al yes we

157
00:06:23,880 --> 00:06:25,860
have to go with this that guy who

158
00:06:25,860 --> 00:06:28,979
says help the world and ehm if you do

159
00:06:28,979 --> 00:06:30,479
n't mind that I say this Dutch Yes

160
00:06:30,479 --> 00:06:33,080
okay but

161
00:06:33,560 --> 00:06:36,479
they have drawn up some kind of guideline from the

162
00:06:36,479 --> 00:06:39,120
OM and and for lawyer It is that

163
00:06:39,120 --> 00:06:40,979
actually sounds reasonable done  language

164
00:06:40,979 --> 00:06:44,520
It's okay to hack a bit, isn't it, so in

165
00:06:44,520 --> 00:06:46,440
legal terms breaking computer peace

166
00:06:46,440 --> 00:06:48,840
or entering a

167
00:06:48,840 --> 00:06:50,940
goldmatized system under a fox

168
00:06:50,940 --> 00:06:55,139
capacity or key under 38 amb

169
00:06:55,139 --> 00:06:58,440
and when is that allowed Well

170
00:06:58,440 --> 00:07:00,660
I had a suspect eh thought it necessary

171
00:07:00,660 --> 00:07:02,759
for democratic society

172
00:07:02,759 --> 00:07:04,680
or  a heavy weed Public Interest,

173
00:07:04,680 --> 00:07:06,960
isn't it You do it for the common Good can't

174
00:07:06,960 --> 00:07:09,360
just be taunted to press or

175
00:07:09,360 --> 00:07:12,000
demolish Staff or ask for money what to do about it

176
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:14,220
No you clearly do it

177
00:07:14,220 --> 00:07:17,100
for the rest of the world then you can do

178
00:07:17,100 --> 00:07:18,360
a  commit a little bit of computer intrusion

179
00:07:18,360 --> 00:07:20,160
Black to prevent a bigger

180
00:07:20,160 --> 00:07:22,440
computer intrusion You are

181
00:07:22,440 --> 00:07:23,340
also allowed to violate that privacy a little bit,

182
00:07:23,340 --> 00:07:24,780
right, because the AVG

183
00:07:24,780 --> 00:07:26,160
is technically quite complicated what you

184
00:07:26,160 --> 00:07:28,380
do to prevent greater privacy,

185
00:07:28,380 --> 00:07:30,240
but how far can you go

186
00:07:30,240 --> 00:07:32,280
Well have  I really in a one an

187
00:07:32,280 --> 00:07:34,139
existing legal term called

188
00:07:34,139 --> 00:07:37,319
proportionality eh so that it meant

189
00:07:37,319 --> 00:07:39,120
a ratio staff the middle

190
00:07:39,120 --> 00:07:41,160
is a garbage is the goal Look if you

191
00:07:41,160 --> 00:07:42,599
walked into a bank or

192
00:07:42,599 --> 00:07:45,539
something You say they are not safe Yes then

193
00:07:45,539 --> 00:07:46,860
it is more mediocre than  the goal then

194
00:07:46,860 --> 00:07:50,099
actually makes it less safe ehm according to the

195
00:07:50,099 --> 00:07:52,380
third criterion sushiarity eh So if

196
00:07:52,380 --> 00:07:54,599
you want to reach the end and you have a

197
00:07:54,599 --> 00:07:56,819
number of means Then look like yes what is

198
00:07:56,819 --> 00:07:59,039
the least drastic means that is

199
00:07:59,039 --> 00:08:00,840
mainly on the Disclosure side

200
00:08:00,840 --> 00:08:03,300
Okay you can  best say eh oh this

201
00:08:03,300 --> 00:08:05,580
hospital has the Bonnie order Do you know

202
00:08:05,580 --> 00:08:07,560
what I then journalist Yes that is

203
00:08:07,560 --> 00:08:08,759
very heavy means to light

204
00:08:08,759 --> 00:08:10,139
patient reason on the street No you have to

205
00:08:10,139 --> 00:08:12,120
go to the hospital itself first It is

206
00:08:12,120 --> 00:08:14,099
not keyed in the means on that  moment

207
00:08:14,099 --> 00:08:17,060
Well I will come back to that later eh

208
00:08:17,060 --> 00:08:19,440
the guideline will be updated from below

209
00:08:19,440 --> 00:08:21,060
a coordeters we have that close

210
00:08:21,060 --> 00:08:22,800
Yes they have checked schrieden also started

211
00:08:22,800 --> 00:08:24,960
shouting boys all do hey take care

212
00:08:24,960 --> 00:08:27,300
before you have a partner and it has already

213
00:08:27,300 --> 00:08:30,120
become an ISO standard Well  and there you

214
00:08:30,120 --> 00:08:31,860
also see a bit of that tension

215
00:08:31,860 --> 00:08:35,479
between hacking and creativity and

216
00:08:35,479 --> 00:08:38,059
professionalization, eh It's the

217
00:08:38,059 --> 00:08:40,740
institutionalization that the standards

218
00:08:40,740 --> 00:08:42,719
and guidelines come and then you probably think

219
00:08:42,719 --> 00:08:44,700
soon gaffelen lady I do

220
00:08:44,700 --> 00:08:47,940
n't want any [ __ ] at all so

221
00:08:47,940 --> 00:08:49,860
from control from the  government

222
00:08:49,860 --> 00:08:51,300
we have all arranged that well

223
00:08:51,300 --> 00:08:52,980
but from the hacker perspective

224
00:08:52,980 --> 00:08:54,720
it was like yes I

225
00:08:54,720 --> 00:08:56,760
can still get lawyers behind I can still get

226
00:08:56,760 --> 00:08:58,320
pissed off missionalists

227
00:08:58,320 --> 00:09:01,019
isn't it good that they arrive at 18 oh

228
00:09:01,019 --> 00:09:02,279
smart boy yes we were they came to work

229
00:09:02,279 --> 00:09:08,040
and  so we need a firewall ehm yes

230
00:09:08,040 --> 00:09:09,899
I think that's inside he had been

231
00:09:09,899 --> 00:09:12,660
busy with coordinators claudia for 20 years

232
00:09:12,660 --> 00:09:14,880
and eh well of course completely

233
00:09:14,880 --> 00:09:16,680
crazy about all the reactions you get now

234
00:09:16,680 --> 00:09:20,519
and now I don't want to bake so then

235
00:09:20,519 --> 00:09:22,740
you make a  insight into where you say yes Sometimes you

236
00:09:22,740 --> 00:09:24,959
have a firewall against all those

237
00:09:24,959 --> 00:09:26,580
forces that only distract from the

238
00:09:26,580 --> 00:09:27,720
fence,

239
00:09:27,720 --> 00:09:32,100
so on September 26, 2019, Astrid

240
00:09:32,100 --> 00:09:34,080
Oostbrug, who was here this weekend,

241
00:09:34,080 --> 00:09:37,740
was also a member of parliament before that, who was on

242
00:09:37,740 --> 00:09:41,420
the responsibles Clothing file

243
00:09:41,420 --> 00:09:44,180
Victoria's  and do you

244
00:09:44,180 --> 00:09:47,160
like the Foundation that you came up with Well okay

245
00:09:47,160 --> 00:09:51,300
buy some donations commentary and erm well that

246
00:09:51,300 --> 00:09:54,480
was DVD 1.0 and so we now have an

247
00:09:54,480 --> 00:09:57,540
official organization an Institute and

248
00:09:57,540 --> 00:09:59,899
then we can have a good look well

249
00:09:59,899 --> 00:10:01,860
developments will of course continue so

250
00:10:01,860 --> 00:10:04,220
the following week  in October eh

251
00:10:04,220 --> 00:10:06,360
we launched ourselves during the

252
00:10:06,360 --> 00:10:08,880
won conference that is covered with t-shirts

253
00:10:08,880 --> 00:10:10,560
and then it got our first

254
00:10:10,560 --> 00:10:14,180
upgrade dvd 1.1

255
00:10:14,180 --> 00:10:16,440
broadening because it had already

256
00:10:16,440 --> 00:10:19,980
set up the security reporting center eh and yes it

257
00:10:19,980 --> 00:10:20,820
was actually going to do a bit of

258
00:10:20,820 --> 00:10:23,100
what we  doen did not yet have a Foundation but

259
00:10:23,100 --> 00:10:24,839
was busy with a number of matters

260
00:10:24,839 --> 00:10:27,060
from Yes this just needs to be solved

261
00:10:27,060 --> 00:10:30,360
and ehm well yes with that upgrade

262
00:10:30,360 --> 00:10:32,580
we also had our first case so yes

263
00:10:32,580 --> 00:10:34,279
also to Frank

264
00:10:34,279 --> 00:10:37,080
and I do not have a technician for

265
00:10:37,080 --> 00:10:40,040
my microphone at the same time

266
00:10:43,480 --> 00:10:46,519
[Music  ]

267
00:10:47,279 --> 00:10:49,579
hello Yes thank you um yes

268
00:11:00,140 --> 00:11:04,079
Dutch four that

269
00:11:04,079 --> 00:11:05,940
he hotline actually a bit of

270
00:11:05,940 --> 00:11:10,680
a bluff eh why eh is a

271
00:11:10,680 --> 00:11:13,620
national Cyber ​​security center but

272
00:11:13,620 --> 00:11:16,140
how National was that really eh What

273
00:11:16,140 --> 00:11:18,240
happened if you came up with a

274
00:11:18,240 --> 00:11:19,740
lot of

275
00:11:19,740 --> 00:11:21,959
Vulnerability ip-  addresses of what

276
00:11:21,959 --> 00:11:24,360
was going on with it let's say Puls

277
00:11:24,360 --> 00:11:26,760
VPN I'm going to the ncsc well

278
00:11:26,760 --> 00:11:28,740
then it turned out that it was mainly sent to Rijk en

279
00:11:28,740 --> 00:11:31,200
Vitaal and that the rest eh

280
00:11:31,200 --> 00:11:33,140
of the rest was

281
00:11:33,140 --> 00:11:36,019
waging somewhere

282
00:11:36,019 --> 00:11:39,959
I don't know eh Anyway  eh citri came

283
00:11:39,959 --> 00:11:44,040
um yes we had created a security

284
00:11:44,040 --> 00:11:46,740
hotline and um yes they looked at

285
00:11:46,740 --> 00:11:48,720
each other for a moment yes now

286
00:11:48,720 --> 00:11:49,800
we can't sit down on a Sunday

287
00:11:49,800 --> 00:11:52,579
and say we are not going to report um

288
00:11:52,579 --> 00:11:55,380
if the NCS is new then we will

289
00:11:55,380 --> 00:11:57,240
do it more and  in it we had our

290
00:11:57,240 --> 00:12:00,660
first 0.9 case Yes how does that work then yes

291
00:12:00,660 --> 00:12:02,700
eh no idea I don't know how to do it

292
00:12:02,700 --> 00:12:03,899
I've never done it so I think

293
00:12:03,899 --> 00:12:06,180
I can do it ehm

294
00:12:06,180 --> 00:12:09,060
Citrix had a horny bend that lead to

295
00:12:09,060 --> 00:12:12,000
shooting Greek files ehm Kees Kwakz

296
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:16,800
reported eh was nu.nl and Yes so this is

297
00:12:16,800 --> 00:12:19,019
what my children already know that I don't

298
00:12:19,019 --> 00:12:20,399
threaten to break up with things that I haven't reached

299
00:12:20,399 --> 00:12:22,440
so send the I

300
00:12:22,440 --> 00:12:25,320
reporting point was a fact eh later It looks like it

301
00:12:25,320 --> 00:12:29,100
has become um and we knew this

302
00:12:29,100 --> 00:12:32,220
not yet eh where just pass it on Liege eh

303
00:12:32,220 --> 00:12:35,279
Matthijs Koot who had scanned it and had

304
00:12:35,279 --> 00:12:36,720
something like that Yes I've scanned it now I want to

305
00:12:36,720 --> 00:12:38,760
report it to some NCC but

306
00:12:38,760 --> 00:12:40,860
they also didn't know that eh that half would

307
00:12:40,860 --> 00:12:42,660
then be thrown away so Well I'll come

308
00:12:42,660 --> 00:12:44,519
here Matthijs We're going  doing it Ehm

309
00:12:44,519 --> 00:12:46,440
was a nice case In the end we

310
00:12:46,440 --> 00:12:48,000
rang the back door ourselves you will get

311
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:51,720
responses back like eh yes ehm Nice that

312
00:12:51,720 --> 00:12:53,579
we know now ehm our

313
00:12:53,579 --> 00:12:55,079
system manager is just here saw but

314
00:12:55,079 --> 00:12:56,480
he is on holiday this week So

315

Wednesday in 2 weeks our

317
00:13:01,440 --> 00:13:02,579
system administrator will tell you the

318
00:13:02,579 --> 00:13:04,519
citrictures must be upgraded

319
00:13:04,519 --> 00:13:07,500
Why are you running Citrix again Well yes

320
00:13:07,500 --> 00:13:10,019
very first case And yes so it was also

321
00:13:10,019 --> 00:13:12,300
time to stretch things a bit more

322
00:13:12,300 --> 00:13:14,160
and I hope

323
00:13:14,160 --> 00:13:16,320
Christian Your microphone is running Yes I

324
00:13:16,320 --> 00:13:17,639
thought that  the sound of a quick fetch

325
00:13:17,639 --> 00:13:20,880
to do the next pack then I

326
00:13:20,880 --> 00:13:23,100
just love wommel

327
00:13:23,100 --> 00:13:27,139
Okay yes that was the first Kees and ehm well

328
00:13:27,139 --> 00:13:30,779
yes it's about hacking creativity

329
00:13:30,779 --> 00:13:33,000
you saw that here But at the same time

330
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:34,680
also the professionalization that you

331
00:13:34,680 --> 00:13:36,420
ensure of Yes you  you don't get any trouble

332
00:13:36,420 --> 00:13:39,839
You are already doing it in a neat way so those

333
00:13:39,839 --> 00:13:41,639
four times that the Public Prosecution Service

334
00:13:41,639 --> 00:13:43,079
then processed their own code of conduct

335
00:13:43,079 --> 00:13:44,940
that was then 1 to 4 with

336
00:13:44,940 --> 00:13:46,860
scanning and reported We are the Good

337
00:13:46,860 --> 00:13:48,000
card a blue blue but that is also

338
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:50,579
that  legal criteria included in it

339
00:13:50,579 --> 00:13:52,920
and if research then joined

340
00:13:52,920 --> 00:13:54,180
us then a volunteer

341
00:13:54,180 --> 00:13:55,860
agreement Vreden also literally

342
00:13:55,860 --> 00:13:58,079
put a signature under that code of

343
00:13:58,079 --> 00:14:00,300
comeds and actually no one ever

344
00:14:00,300 --> 00:14:03,120
made a fuss about it but eh I'm

345
00:14:03,120 --> 00:14:04,880
so glad we did that then

346
00:14:04,880 --> 00:14:07,019
because  we also radiate to the

347
00:14:07,019 --> 00:14:09,180
outside world or yes this is

348
00:14:09,180 --> 00:14:11,519
how you do it and and Now the people

349
00:14:11,519 --> 00:14:14,220
in the naged also understand what we do so that was

350
00:14:14,220 --> 00:14:17,160
1.2 eh step further in

351
00:14:17,160 --> 00:14:19,800
professionalization

352
00:14:19,800 --> 00:14:21,839
the next more and more studies eh

353
00:14:21,839 --> 00:14:23,700
Citrix we only did  in the Netherlands

354
00:14:23,700 --> 00:14:25,920
and what a funny addition We

355
00:14:25,920 --> 00:14:28,200
started with 546 in would given moment

356
00:14:28,200 --> 00:14:30,600
10 that middle wok really called you know

357
00:14:30,600 --> 00:14:32,459
so if we help desk eh That's that eh

358
00:14:32,459 --> 00:14:34,920
the security silly point that

359
00:14:34,920 --> 00:14:37,800
really started helping people only when we got the

360
00:14:37,800 --> 00:14:41,639
Kees is  bigger ehm wool at Microsoft yes

361
00:14:41,639 --> 00:14:43,500
then we would have Take a short time million Yes

362
00:14:43,500 --> 00:14:45,779
you will not call them again of course

363
00:14:45,779 --> 00:14:47,760
at least a quarter of a million service

364
00:14:47,760 --> 00:14:50,160
worldwide of which the 640,000

365
00:14:50,160 --> 00:14:52,019
are vulnerable so we will still email them

366
00:14:52,019 --> 00:14:54,540
VI info@bus ethanol You're a nice

367
00:14:54,540 --> 00:14:58,139
link Well that's that  a nice one

368
00:14:58,139 --> 00:14:59,820
study after another and well we

369
00:14:59,820 --> 00:15:01,620
grow quite a lot through the year

370
00:15:01,620 --> 00:15:04,380
after that my studies and and yes

371
00:15:04,380 --> 00:15:06,300
bigger team and then it was always like

372
00:15:06,300 --> 00:15:09,480
oh There is a cve coming out it is high high

373
00:15:09,480 --> 00:15:10,440
we look at it can

374
00:15:10,440 --> 00:15:12,300
fingerprint it yes  turn on scenes

375
00:15:12,300 --> 00:15:15,060
hatsikidee so report that process that we are

376
00:15:15,060 --> 00:15:18,319
always eh professional

377
00:15:18,360 --> 00:15:21,959
and also diverse so the next upgrade

378
00:15:21,959 --> 00:15:23,639
was we're not just going to report known Quest

379
00:15:23,639 --> 00:15:26,339
to heemskerne No he then came

380
00:15:26,339 --> 00:15:28,440
along Tom Wolters and he

381
00:15:28,440 --> 00:15:30,600
says yes I have a deed base here with 3  .5

382
00:15:30,600 --> 00:15:32,760
million legials there will be a botnet

383
00:15:32,760 --> 00:15:36,060
and yes kind of provider that eh he got the

384
00:15:36,060 --> 00:15:38,220
nuts Take well and eh yes wanted to get rid of it I

385
00:15:38,220 --> 00:15:39,300


386
00:15:39,300 --> 00:15:41,220
went to the police with it but

387
00:15:41,220 --> 00:15:43,680
I didn't hear anything

388
00:15:43,680 --> 00:15:45,720
Can you do that Oh yes There are

389
00:15:45,720 --> 00:15:48,000
177,000 Dutch people in it  and it's New

390
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:50,880
material Okay well then we can come along

391
00:15:50,880 --> 00:15:53,660
but then you will get a board

392
00:15:55,699 --> 00:15:58,380
and then we went to look at that list of well

393
00:15:58,380 --> 00:16:00,060
you can mean those people directly

394
00:16:00,060 --> 00:16:01,800
from he dude eh reset your

395
00:16:01,800 --> 00:16:03,899
password because eh It starts with  that

396
00:16:03,899 --> 00:16:06,420
ends with me that well you always arrive

397
00:16:06,420 --> 00:16:07,860
at a certain point we removed the urls

398
00:16:07,860 --> 00:16:09,660
and approached those organizations

399
00:16:09,660 --> 00:16:12,060
through others somewhere from

400
00:16:12,060 --> 00:16:13,380
Well you have all the organizations

401
00:16:13,380 --> 00:16:16,160
in this one that are uh

402
00:16:16,160 --> 00:16:18,420
users that are so a

403
00:16:18,420 --> 00:16:19,740
password differs well it  is also very

404
00:16:19,740 --> 00:16:23,579
tekie already complicated because yes privacy eh

405
00:16:23,579 --> 00:16:25,440
good thing that was so a new look

406
00:16:25,440 --> 00:16:28,500
of the research DVD 1.4

407
00:16:28,500 --> 00:16:31,560
and with DVD 1.5w it is even more exciting

408
00:16:31,560 --> 00:16:34,980
Zero d'research Yes look now eh now

409
00:16:34,980 --> 00:16:38,040
we are really going to talk of course eh so that  we were

410
00:16:38,040 --> 00:16:40,019
going to find new vulnerable beds ourselves and

411
00:16:40,019 --> 00:16:42,120
then also scan for them because that

412
00:16:42,120 --> 00:16:43,920
is nice of course then you already have

413
00:16:43,920 --> 00:16:46,440
an overview of who would

414
00:16:46,440 --> 00:16:49,980
be vulnerable if this works and then you can

415
00:16:49,980 --> 00:16:51,540
scan melros who will decrease how that how

416
00:16:51,540 --> 00:16:53,880
that will decrease  of course How is the

417
00:16:53,880 --> 00:16:55,380
weather of course and we get

418
00:16:55,380 --> 00:16:57,240
the piece of professionalization Golf

419
00:16:57,240 --> 00:16:59,699
conductor to adapt to Yes how do you deal with that

420
00:16:59,699 --> 00:17:02,160
well if you ever

421
00:17:02,160 --> 00:17:03,360
invented a sore yourself you know how

422
00:17:03,360 --> 00:17:05,939
damn difficult it is and you go to

423
00:17:05,939 --> 00:17:08,160
the Android  and you then say Hello I

424
00:17:08,160 --> 00:17:10,260
found something Of course I'm not going to take

425
00:17:10,260 --> 00:17:12,480
your doll with me right away and then

426
00:17:12,480 --> 00:17:14,040
nothing for a long time or say

427
00:17:14,040 --> 00:17:15,900
no don't worry it's all safe eh

428
00:17:15,900 --> 00:17:19,140
or you get an mdi now you can't take anything

429
00:17:19,140 --> 00:17:21,480
with you of course but  good some

430
00:17:21,480 --> 00:17:22,919
cases Do you have contact and then

431
00:17:22,919 --> 00:17:23,699
at some point you also have to

432
00:17:23,699 --> 00:17:25,380
say a little busy behind van

433
00:17:25,380 --> 00:17:26,819
Hey at some point we want to go

434
00:17:26,819 --> 00:17:29,940
out with this because it is unsafe for the rest

435
00:17:29,940 --> 00:17:32,640
of the world

436
00:17:32,640 --> 00:17:34,980
then we didn't have a huge  set up

437
00:17:34,980 --> 00:17:39,299
most of it is 60 days 90 days eh It

438
00:17:39,299 --> 00:17:41,580
also depends a bit on how complex the

439
00:17:41,580 --> 00:17:42,960
Vulnerability is but if it really nothing

440
00:17:42,960 --> 00:17:44,400
happens the other side Yes of course

441
00:17:44,400 --> 00:17:46,380
at some point have to start

442
00:17:46,380 --> 00:17:48,240
disclausing people say Hey this

443
00:17:48,240 --> 00:17:51,960
stuff is unsafe and unbullied so  there

444
00:17:51,960 --> 00:17:54,179
we went really coordinated from the

445
00:17:54,179 --> 00:17:55,679
bellity disco then that connection is with

446
00:17:55,679 --> 00:17:57,660
a limited circle of insides of which

447
00:17:57,660 --> 00:17:58,860
you know well they should

448
00:17:58,860 --> 00:18:01,260
know first and still wider and then

449
00:18:01,260 --> 00:18:02,280
at some point consoven there is

450
00:18:02,280 --> 00:18:05,460
an action then he does something and  of course

451
00:18:05,460 --> 00:18:09,539
also professionalization resume and yes

452
00:18:09,539 --> 00:18:11,160
I must honestly say I was apes proud

453
00:18:11,160 --> 00:18:14,880
that eh dvd thanks to not so Boonstra was also

454
00:18:14,880 --> 00:18:16,260


455
00:18:16,260 --> 00:18:18,360
able to register the first bowl of filling bullity and explosions huh it's

456
00:18:18,360 --> 00:18:22,200
all like that resumes hackers best resume and eh

457
00:18:22,200 --> 00:18:24,000
then it's also somewhere and then we can

458
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:25,559
other people also something about that well in

459
00:18:25,559 --> 00:18:27,780
this case with casea

460
00:18:27,780 --> 00:18:30,360
eh for the people who eh presentation eh

461
00:18:30,360 --> 00:18:32,160
of the letterhof yesterday didn't

462
00:18:32,160 --> 00:18:34,440
see There was a manic provider

463
00:18:34,440 --> 00:18:36,120
software

464
00:18:36,120 --> 00:18:38,520
Well if that leak well it's a

465
00:18:38,520 --> 00:18:40,020
bit technical center a bit That

466
00:18:40,020 --> 00:18:42,419
you can just get over it there are people already

467
00:18:42,419 --> 00:18:43,700
not resistant to it

468
00:18:43,700 --> 00:18:47,880
worldwide eh 2200 eh parties that

469
00:18:47,880 --> 00:18:50,940
use that also for their customers the do

470
00:18:50,940 --> 00:18:52,980
that * 100 and well then you have almost

471
00:18:52,980 --> 00:18:56,100
a million eh vulnerable organizations

472
00:18:56,100 --> 00:18:58,740
for that software now you know who had

473
00:18:58,740 --> 00:19:01,260
found why it can Sea working to

474
00:19:01,260 --> 00:19:03,000
solve that they always had eh

475
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:05,340
a new version there is faith in

476
00:19:05,340 --> 00:19:08,039
Development Team of 100 eh velper that

477
00:19:08,039 --> 00:19:09,600
sent its Wietse and not sent

478
00:19:09,600 --> 00:19:12,419
teeth full never returned to isluik well it took

479
00:19:12,419 --> 00:19:14,160
two months  it's

480
00:19:14,160 --> 00:19:15,660
well you know what you've got another few weeks and then

481
00:19:15,660 --> 00:19:17,460
and then we're going to announce it

482
00:19:17,460 --> 00:19:20,820
well while it's the Second Of July the

483
00:19:20,820 --> 00:19:22,500
Friday night of course

484
00:19:22,500 --> 00:19:24,980
Why

485
00:19:26,419 --> 00:19:28,580
Americans put the beer in the barbecue so

486
00:19:28,580 --> 00:19:30,600
let's go wish them all

487
00:19:30,600 --> 00:19:34,020
that attack lies  those worldwide and

488
00:19:34,020 --> 00:19:35,760
eh then we had already been busy for two months

489
00:19:35,760 --> 00:19:37,919
eh because to solve So we will be

490
00:19:37,919 --> 00:19:40,140
all vulnerable organizations

491
00:19:40,140 --> 00:19:42,539
under the button so we knew

492
00:19:42,539 --> 00:19:45,000
exactly who was vulnerable worldwide even

493
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:47,220
better than cassé itself

494
00:19:47,220 --> 00:19:48,840
eh because I can cook that stuff for a while

495

497
00:19:52,080 --> 00:19:54,059
on who uses it all so

498

There were now 1500 parties son eh

505
00:20:14,640 --> 00:20:16,320
we could have been much more and

506
00:20:16,320 --> 00:20:18,960
the underction eh in the Netherlands we found

507
00:20:18,960 --> 00:20:22,260
the 146 eh within 2 days it was at

508
00:20:22,260 --> 00:20:25,559
zero well pretty good

509
00:20:25,559 --> 00:20:28,380
so  suddenly also appeared in the media Wolf

510
00:20:28,380 --> 00:20:30,539
journal and what was quite hilarious in

511
00:20:30,539 --> 00:20:32,880
American media they were talking about eh

512
00:20:32,880 --> 00:20:37,919
the dutcherte and csc or eh the divd so they

513
00:20:37,919 --> 00:20:39,660
also woke up 13C from Huh wait a minute

514
00:20:39,660 --> 00:20:41,880
with that kana's in dvd when the

515
00:20:41,880 --> 00:20:45,000
Dutch said God  eh that's a bit

516
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:49,320
uncomfortable um and what kind of eh

517
00:20:49,320 --> 00:20:51,179
Dutch Safety Board was

518
00:20:51,179 --> 00:20:53,700
also busy at that time after the

519
00:20:53,700 --> 00:20:55,380
seatrix collision the first case we

520
00:20:55,380 --> 00:20:57,780
showed yes what about that

521
00:20:57,780 --> 00:20:59,700
software and those vulnerabilities that kind of thing

522
00:20:59,700 --> 00:21:01,320
and how are things going  we actually deal with

523
00:21:01,320 --> 00:21:02,820


524
00:21:02,820 --> 00:21:04,799
that that started at Citrix so they came to

525
00:21:04,799 --> 00:21:06,539
us Oh By the way he

526
00:21:06,539 --> 00:21:07,860
also has Microsoft extensions and we

527
00:21:07,860 --> 00:21:09,539
still have those and we still have those And well then

528
00:21:09,539 --> 00:21:11,700
they were almost done the presses stop

529
00:21:11,700 --> 00:21:14,340
Yes we take too  just a minute Well

530
00:21:14,340 --> 00:21:16,559
that if you read that report that he did that

531
00:21:16,559 --> 00:21:18,539
with every major business we were the

532
00:21:18,539 --> 00:21:20,880
first to scan to report with

533
00:21:20,880 --> 00:21:22,740
the final conclusion safety of

534
00:21:22,740 --> 00:21:24,360
the Netherlands depends on Guido van

535
00:21:24,360 --> 00:21:28,020
Volunteers we want that

536
00:21:28,020 --> 00:21:29,580
so that both to quite a lot

537
00:21:29,580 --> 00:21:31,860
political bad and also some grumpy

538
00:21:31,860 --> 00:21:36,678
at ncsc because they are not allowed what we do

539
00:21:37,140 --> 00:21:40,520
And why then will I come back in a bit

540
00:21:41,520 --> 00:21:44,820
Well yes that gave a lot of appreciation and

541
00:21:44,820 --> 00:21:46,740
when The Hague wakes up you can

542
00:21:46,740 --> 00:21:50,400
get money so we got a site yes

543
00:21:50,400 --> 00:21:51,200
sorry

544
00:21:51,200 --> 00:21:55,039
previous  years and

545
00:21:55,039 --> 00:21:58,919
this is still presenter and eh that was

546
00:21:58,919 --> 00:22:00,780
for 1 year just to professionalize things a bit

547
00:22:00,780 --> 00:22:03,320
better to start

548
00:22:03,320 --> 00:22:06,860
eh through seya we get money from the US

549
00:22:06,860 --> 00:22:09,900
Hunters are squishy company for a

550
00:22:09,900 --> 00:22:12,620
customer yes indeed also manager

551
00:22:12,620 --> 00:22:15,600

552
00:22:15,600 --> 00:22:17,400
awesom that guest helped us with that

553
00:22:17,400 --> 00:22:20,460
and you are going to do something like that Yes I think

554
00:22:20,460 --> 00:22:22,860
that contact with eh yes pretty much do

555
00:22:22,860 --> 00:22:25,440

00:22:25,440 --> 00:22:27,480
end eh well

557
00:22:27,480 --> 00:22:29,820
because that account number just

558
00:22:29,820 --> 00:22:33,380
fine I thought  also an uh

559
00:22:33,380 --> 00:22:35,460
100,000 dollars about me what the [ __ ]

560
00:22:35,460 --> 00:22:39,240
Do you know that I promised you that yes

561
00:22:39,240 --> 00:22:42,960
no they liked it Oh okay well Panic In

562
00:22:42,960 --> 00:22:44,940
The Tent

563
00:22:44,940 --> 00:22:46,740
there you just got money Yes you have to take it um

564
00:22:46,740 --> 00:22:49,700


565
00:22:50,280 --> 00:22:54,360
Yes well yes really meanwhile and that is

566
00:22:54,360 --> 00:22:56,460
the most important eh

567
00:22:56,460 --> 00:22:58,919
Frissen who then stands up We have

568
00:22:58,919 --> 00:23:01,020
grown enormously so you can no longer have a

569
00:23:01,020 --> 00:23:03,840
group of loose-hanging eh volunteers,

570
00:23:03,840 --> 00:23:04,919
you really have to

571
00:23:04,919 --> 00:23:08,340
professionalize that and eh,

572
00:23:08,340 --> 00:23:09,419
of course I'm a lot of fun for a while

573
00:23:09,419 --> 00:23:11,580
and yes people to

574
00:23:11,580 --> 00:23:14,720
arrange that all a bit well

575
00:23:14,720 --> 00:23:18,539
dvd 2.0 will they be about this Origin

576
00:23:18,539 --> 00:23:22,140
Story eh this autobiography eh questions or

577
00:23:22,140 --> 00:23:24,299
comments or ambiguities or something needed a

578
00:23:24,299 --> 00:23:25,760
thing or something

579
00:23:25,760 --> 00:23:32,100
eh goal until 1.89 was it

580
00:23:32,100 --> 00:23:34,320
really needed there Yes I really notice the difference

581
00:23:34,320 --> 00:23:35,880
here Foundation had so that you

582
00:23:35,880 --> 00:23:37,740
could also talk more easily  well what

583
00:23:37,740 --> 00:23:39,419
was actually the biggest advantage eh

584
00:23:39,419 --> 00:23:42,480
that identity so that you spleen from eh

585
00:23:42,480 --> 00:23:45,600
Jonathan from dvd.nl and then they watch oh

586
00:23:45,600 --> 00:23:48,659
dvd.nl oh that's legit that was actually

587
00:23:48,659 --> 00:23:51,600
the most important thing eh

588
00:23:51,600 --> 00:23:54,179
never had those tanners eh greetings  is that one

589
00:23:54,179 --> 00:23:55,679
you get anyway Or here LinkedIn

590
00:23:55,679 --> 00:23:59,159
and the journalists eh yes they knew where

591
00:23:59,159 --> 00:24:00,900
to find us but then we could

592
00:24:00,900 --> 00:24:03,059
prevent a hacker from being very

593
00:24:03,059 --> 00:24:05,159
busy during research and and something

594
00:24:05,159 --> 00:24:07,140
blurted out that is no so that was also possible

595
00:24:07,140 --> 00:24:08,880
professionalize that is really the

596
00:24:08,880 --> 00:24:11,159
communication strategy eh we also

597
00:24:11,159 --> 00:24:12,840
visited one journalist with us that he

598
00:24:12,840 --> 00:24:14,880
actually From our has to article

599
00:24:14,880 --> 00:24:17,039
about cacea what Gerard Jans has

600
00:24:17,039 --> 00:24:18,720
written That he just

601
00:24:18,720 --> 00:24:20,940
brought in from us and it has much more

602
00:24:20,940 --> 00:24:23,340
control over the story eh that  the

603
00:24:23,340 --> 00:24:24,539
most for me age here who know

604
00:24:24,539 --> 00:24:26,940
leaks about Well yes if you

605
00:24:26,940 --> 00:24:28,320
came up with a leak then we will immediately appear

606
00:24:28,320 --> 00:24:30,179
now.

607
00:24:30,179 --> 00:24:33,480


608
00:24:33,480 --> 00:24:37,260
so it worked

609
00:24:37,260 --> 00:24:39,260
well then you will professionalize

610
00:24:39,260 --> 00:24:43,260
dvd 2.0 so just a whole drawing table eh

611
00:24:43,260 --> 00:24:44,940
only board bed volunteers that

612
00:24:44,940 --> 00:24:47,159
no longer works eh we need a

613
00:24:47,159 --> 00:24:49,260
management Team buildings

614
00:24:49,260 --> 00:24:53,100
cool so well Victor the head of research

615
00:24:53,100 --> 00:24:54,900
eh because he was first the chairman of

616
00:24:54,900 --> 00:24:58,260
the Foundation and um we  got a head

617

pmeester charish he's sitting there so Astrid wo

619
00:25:04,740 --> 00:25:06,419
n't come to a medal with his that weather

620
00:25:06,419 --> 00:25:08,280
chairman Fleur came in a

621
00:25:08,280 --> 00:25:12,080
secretary because that was me and eh

622
00:25:12,080 --> 00:25:14,640
Lucinda's head of communication well Lennart

623
00:25:14,640 --> 00:25:17,120
Hooft c-sert huh so true  the reports

624
00:25:17,120 --> 00:25:19,380
were sent around Well and fruit

625
00:25:19,380 --> 00:25:20,340
of course always a separate

626
00:25:20,340 --> 00:25:23,039
position as eh crisis manager eh because yes

627
00:25:23,039 --> 00:25:25,679
that was quite necessary and eh well then

628
00:25:25,679 --> 00:25:27,120
the question arose Yes who will be the Dirk

629
00:25:27,120 --> 00:25:29,179
eh that's what are you going to do Chris

630
00:25:29,179 --> 00:25:32,460
copper typhus but  okay eh I think

631
00:25:32,460 --> 00:25:34,020
that's a very nice new

632
00:25:34,020 --> 00:25:36,539
challenge in my life many people who

633
00:25:36,539 --> 00:25:37,620
have never actually done it before

634
00:25:37,620 --> 00:25:39,240
and that is of course already typical hackers

635
00:25:39,240 --> 00:25:40,679
you know old and that Ark It's going to be

636
00:25:40,679 --> 00:25:43,860
nice to do it all yourself um so that

637
00:25:43,860 --> 00:25:46,080
looks  then eh like that eh that you

638
00:25:46,080 --> 00:25:47,870
put that in a structure that

639
00:25:47,870 --> 00:25:50,360
[Music]

640
00:25:50,360 --> 00:25:53,460
This this is very good hear that

641
00:25:53,460 --> 00:25:56,460
reality is a lot messy eh

642
00:25:56,460 --> 00:25:58,559
so we already had a eh a

643
00:25:58,559 --> 00:26:00,659
supervisory board super five reboot eh new

644
00:26:00,659 --> 00:26:02,640
board Well that gives the order  to the

645
00:26:02,640 --> 00:26:05,700
director who runs the operation well it

646
00:26:05,700 --> 00:26:06,900
is actually mainly talking with money out of pocket

647
00:26:06,900 --> 00:26:10,320
and and eh holding presentations tame

648
00:26:10,320 --> 00:26:11,760
Leiden stuff like that filling in a lot of paper Well

649
00:26:11,760 --> 00:26:13,820

650
00:26:13,820 --> 00:26:16,380

00:26:26,400 --> 00:26:28,260
too but you work and

657
00:26:28,260 --> 00:26:30,299

00:26:35,400 --> 00:26:37,140
privacy  Officer eh the

661
00:26:37,140 --> 00:26:38,820
declaration processing function eh is broad well of course

662
00:26:38,820 --> 00:26:41,700
and a crisis manager so then

663
00:26:41,700 --> 00:26:44,460
you have 100 people of which the upcoming

664
00:26:44,460 --> 00:26:46,620
fresh compleans department is 10% of the

665
00:26:46,620 --> 00:26:48,000
entire organization

666
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:50,279
eh in fact eh Peter is now working on

667
00:26:50,279 --> 00:26:51,960
an i sms Eh what do we have according to

668
00:26:51,960 --> 00:26:55,140
isosens in thousands so we will

669
00:26:55,140 --> 00:26:57,200
soon have a hackers collective that is

670
00:26:57,200 --> 00:27:00,960
set to 27.1 How is that so there

671
00:27:00,960 --> 00:27:02,159
you actually still see the most bizarre

672
00:27:02,159 --> 00:27:03,679
form of fences creative time

673
00:27:03,679 --> 00:27:06,720
professionalization and we

674
00:27:06,720 --> 00:27:07,980
don't need that certificate at all because we

675
00:27:07,980 --> 00:27:10,640
don't have customers so

676
00:27:12,240 --> 00:27:14,159
I'm  not those departments Research level

677
00:27:14,159 --> 00:27:16,080
12 and 3 eh so it starts with level 1

678
00:27:16,080 --> 00:27:17,279
those are my public things that

679
00:27:17,279 --> 00:27:19,020
everyone can do second word that piece of

680
00:27:19,020 --> 00:27:20,520
funny I find it more difficult level

681
00:27:20,520 --> 00:27:23,220
3 Zero Day exciting stuff eh not an

682
00:27:23,220 --> 00:27:26,340
obasis at seasert de tisps The tricet

683
00:27:26,340 --> 00:27:28,140
information  Sharing Partners eh that

684
00:27:28,140 --> 00:27:31,740
also went through other parties passed on the

685
00:27:31,740 --> 00:27:33,480
baton to the NCC who eh he said

686
00:27:33,480 --> 00:27:34,980
yes give us all the questions but We do

687
00:27:34,980 --> 00:27:38,240
n't mean anything by eh maup with eh

688
00:27:38,240 --> 00:27:40,860
information further something service setzer eh

689
00:27:40,860 --> 00:27:44,580
per case DTC especially eh reduce

690
00:27:44,580 --> 00:27:47,279
Rotterdam saw perfect from  who can we

691
00:27:47,279 --> 00:27:49,440
report that this ends up with the right

692
00:27:49,440 --> 00:27:52,080
victims

693
00:27:52,080 --> 00:27:53,299
erm

694
00:27:53,299 --> 00:27:55,620
department idea Casper would

695
00:27:55,620 --> 00:27:57,480
tell something about that later actually infrastructure

696
00:27:57,480 --> 00:28:00,059
helps desk have its systems Yes it

697
00:28:00,059 --> 00:28:01,440
really is just the organization as

698
00:28:01,440 --> 00:28:03,900
incredible the communication eh

699
00:28:03,900 --> 00:28:05,820
merchandise of course events

700
00:28:05,820 --> 00:28:09,000
laugh erm well and that  rescue

701
00:28:09,000 --> 00:28:11,400
Crafting is a compliment do

702
00:28:11,400 --> 00:28:14,779
you think this is complicated

703
00:28:15,059 --> 00:28:19,279
do that to the power of 6 because

704
00:28:20,480 --> 00:28:22,919
dvds amby general just above the

705
00:28:22,919 --> 00:28:24,419
institution so you may get money

706
00:28:24,419 --> 00:28:25,740
but that may still be counterbalanced

707
00:28:25,740 --> 00:28:27,659
so people came to us from Hey do

708
00:28:27,659 --> 00:28:29,580
you want this  going to do Look money for eh is

709
00:28:29,580 --> 00:28:32,520
not possible at all Well then came Victor

710
00:28:32,520 --> 00:28:35,220
glasses and DVD Fund huh so that's a

711
00:28:35,220 --> 00:28:36,720
Fund what actually the same goal or us

712
00:28:36,720 --> 00:28:38,039
but people can put money into

713
00:28:38,039 --> 00:28:40,380
running projects eh There is now a

714
00:28:40,380 --> 00:28:41,940
trial concept for a certain

715
00:28:41,940 --> 00:28:46,020
platform ehm  the DVD Academy that was

716
00:28:46,020 --> 00:28:48,360
actually Astrid's ambition or a start or to give

717
00:28:48,360 --> 00:28:51,299
young people who are good

718
00:28:51,299 --> 00:28:52,620
with computers but not so good at

719
00:28:52,620 --> 00:28:56,039
school a learning place and eh

720
00:28:56,039 --> 00:28:58,860
develop eh but our separate

721
00:28:58,860 --> 00:29:00,480
Foundation you don't know of course

722
00:29:00,480 --> 00:29:02,159
that he develops himself

723
00:29:02,159 --> 00:29:04,320
self-taught the young people in our know your

724
00:29:04,320 --> 00:29:06,659
refstructure eh, turn the world eh,

725
00:29:06,659 --> 00:29:08,580
so that is a separate Foundation and a

726
00:29:08,580 --> 00:29:11,580
separate infrastructure and How many students

727
00:29:11,580 --> 00:29:13,080
are there now Victor

728
00:29:13,080 --> 00:29:15,600
161 students

729
00:29:15,600 --> 00:29:17,460
should actually be 128 nice and round to

730
00:29:17,460 --> 00:29:19,580
show

731
00:29:33,260 --> 00:29:35,700
We will also come back later we will

732
00:29:35,700 --> 00:29:37,860
report  of course the whole world in

733
00:29:37,860 --> 00:29:40,320
English and those people don't know DVD either

734
00:29:40,320 --> 00:29:42,480
so how nice would it be that you

735
00:29:42,480 --> 00:29:44,460
have representation in every country a

736
00:29:44,460 --> 00:29:46,799
kind of chapter that forwards the reports

737
00:29:46,799 --> 00:29:50,880
in that Portuguese Brazil uh with a

738
00:29:50,880 --> 00:29:53,659
very long dyslemer in America eh

739
00:29:53,659 --> 00:29:56,700
translation to the local culture

740
00:29:56,700 --> 00:29:59,399
but also have a separate foundation so that if

741
00:29:59,399 --> 00:30:01,860
things go wrong there, a lawsuit or

742
00:30:01,860 --> 00:30:04,440
someone does something crazy that falls over in

743
00:30:04,440 --> 00:30:07,380
this one, it will continue So and see Elbow

744
00:30:07,380 --> 00:30:10,200
Well and because eh Victor has a kind of fat

745
00:30:10,200 --> 00:30:12,440
he also had davey.club

746
00:30:12,440 --> 00:30:17,340
dvd.jarity eh a  BVD eh the org eh then

747
00:30:17,340 --> 00:30:18,899
I said different DVD Space then you can

748
00:30:18,899 --> 00:30:21,299
use them all eh 10 also

749
00:30:21,299 --> 00:30:23,159
do Space program or something DVD

750
00:30:23,159 --> 00:30:26,120
Space Yes okay Well yes

751
00:30:26,120 --> 00:30:28,380
DVD Family we clamped that at a

752
00:30:28,380 --> 00:30:29,340
certain point to put all that

753
00:30:29,340 --> 00:30:31,620
foundation on one page  and

754
00:30:31,620 --> 00:30:32,880
so we also have every month a

755
00:30:32,880 --> 00:30:34,700
Family consultation

756
00:30:34,700 --> 00:30:37,320
with complicated Oh yes and DVD club for

757
00:30:37,320 --> 00:30:40,200
that And this one is cute DVD Charity

758
00:30:40,200 --> 00:30:42,720
so that is eh yes actually with the Brus

759
00:30:42,720 --> 00:30:45,360
foundation but then hackers eh So there

760
00:30:45,360 --> 00:30:46,260
are sure that it  if there are no more money

761
00:30:46,260 --> 00:30:47,640
problems then you can

762
00:30:47,640 --> 00:30:50,960
submit a request for a laptop

763
00:30:52,380 --> 00:30:54,299
if he is still terminally ill have

764
00:30:54,299 --> 00:30:57,059
no children put dvd Charity in

765
00:30:57,059 --> 00:31:00,779
your will eh great

766
00:31:00,779 --> 00:31:04,740
then at least now Yes that has

767
00:31:04,740 --> 00:31:07,140
become a separate Foundation also eh there are

768
00:31:07,140 --> 00:31:08,820
also the others  party in the Netherlands

769
00:31:08,820 --> 00:31:10,919
by reporting so global the world

770
00:31:10,919 --> 00:31:12,480
knows or will do it worldwide

771
00:31:12,480 --> 00:31:14,760
hopefully it sends it milestone does

772
00:31:14,760 --> 00:31:16,620
that in the Netherlands with the party that

773
00:31:16,620 --> 00:31:18,419
just mentioned joined so with the

774
00:31:18,419 --> 00:31:19,620
Dutch Management Company internet

775
00:31:19,620 --> 00:31:22,020
monitors are in Connect Trust but

776
00:31:22,020 --> 00:31:23,640
also a lot  connect other Dies to

777
00:31:23,640 --> 00:31:25,740


778
00:31:25,740 --> 00:31:28,440
get the report from us to the right place well then it's not fun for

779
00:31:28,440 --> 00:31:30,000
people together hotel like me own

780
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:31,919
scanning Infra so over to our heads

781
00:31:31,919 --> 00:31:35,000
it was

782
00:31:35,580 --> 00:31:40,559
in a city I believe Yes suddenly closes

783
00:31:40,559 --> 00:31:41,820
we're going to fly through  because of course I can

784
00:31:41,820 --> 00:31:43,020
also keep a whole

785
00:31:43,020 --> 00:31:44,580
presentation here we are going to do that now

786
00:31:44,580 --> 00:31:48,140
she will definitely do it again

787
00:31:48,140 --> 00:31:50,240
not a year and a half ago came in

788
00:31:50,240 --> 00:31:52,740
ehm I was told well we

789
00:31:52,740 --> 00:31:54,779
actually have some infrastructure We

790
00:31:54,779 --> 00:31:57,360
have some servers We have our own

791
00:31:57,360 --> 00:31:59,580
house We have  Nip Range and then we'll

792
00:31:59,580 --> 00:32:02,820
do something with it I thought Nice eh I can do

793
00:32:02,820 --> 00:32:05,399
some hacking but I'd rather be busy

794
00:32:05,399 --> 00:32:07,440
building things and I was very

795
00:32:07,440 --> 00:32:09,120
curious how this eh how this

796
00:32:09,120 --> 00:32:12,720
would get out of hand eh The idea was eh the

797
00:32:12,720 --> 00:32:14,100
coming more and more hackers We will

798
00:32:14,100 --> 00:32:16,440
soon have 50 soon with 100 with

799
00:32:16,440 --> 00:32:18,960
500 hackers on infrastructure

800
00:32:18,960 --> 00:32:21,240
We attack all sorts of things and it is in a

801
00:32:21,240 --> 00:32:23,760
gray area eh and you can handle that

802
00:32:23,760 --> 00:32:25,200
and you can make sure that they don't

803
00:32:25,200 --> 00:32:26,760
do crazy things  and uh that we don't

804
00:32:26,760 --> 00:32:28,559
get charged and that our service does

805
00:32:28,559 --> 00:32:29,820
n't get pulled out of the pull by

806
00:32:29,820 --> 00:32:32,760
the police Well that that uh that's

807
00:32:32,760 --> 00:32:34,020
actually a challenge that I'm

808
00:32:34,020 --> 00:32:35,279
still working on to this day

809
00:32:35,279 --> 00:32:37,860
uh together the Hill Team some  of

810
00:32:37,860 --> 00:32:40,200
them is also here that the infrastructure

811
00:32:40,200 --> 00:32:41,700
Team visit also still people

812
00:32:41,700 --> 00:32:44,940
to build with it to think um yes so I

813
00:32:44,940 --> 00:32:47,039
said started a small actually with eh with

814
00:32:47,039 --> 00:32:49,260
this server at the bottom That was the only one

815
00:32:49,260 --> 00:32:51,360
that I think was either or that at the top of that

816
00:32:51,360 --> 00:32:54,179
at least one Yes yes the one

817
00:32:54,179 --> 00:32:55,620
at the top with that sticker was the

818
00:32:55,620 --> 00:32:58,559
first that is the first DVD server erm

819
00:32:58,559 --> 00:33:01,140
There will be another Fireball and Switch so eh

820
00:33:01,140 --> 00:33:02,880
and eh we started with that and then

821
00:33:02,880 --> 00:33:04,440
we installed proxmod on it once

822
00:33:04,440 --> 00:33:06,299
and a few virtualchinese

823
00:33:06,299 --> 00:33:08,820
and we messed around a bit and uh

824
00:33:08,820 --> 00:33:11,399
then we started clustering uh

825
00:33:11,399 --> 00:33:13,380
started thinking about how can we

826
00:33:13,380 --> 00:33:14,820
use shared storage how can we

827
00:33:14,820 --> 00:33:16,940
expand it further how can we uh

828
00:33:16,940 --> 00:33:18,600
maybe want to update in the future

829
00:33:18,600 --> 00:33:20,460
to  10 GB connections

830
00:33:20,460 --> 00:33:22,380
100 GB connections I think those are

831
00:33:22,380 --> 00:33:24,779
still in there but in the meantime

832
00:33:24,779 --> 00:33:27,299
we have started very small Well I

833
00:33:27,299 --> 00:33:28,940
also say start small Thing bake we think eh

834
00:33:28,940 --> 00:33:31,919
we Thinking ahead to an organization that

835
00:33:31,919 --> 00:33:33,960
can scale to hundreds of people who

836
00:33:33,960 --> 00:33:37,740
can work safely um where all

837
00:33:37,740 --> 00:33:39,419
actions they perform are veined and

838
00:33:39,419 --> 00:33:41,159
logged so that we can use it later

839
00:33:41,159 --> 00:33:42,779
for our own investigation or in

840
00:33:42,779 --> 00:33:44,940
case things do go wrong that we

841
00:33:44,940 --> 00:33:49,140
have evidence Ehm eh the big

842
00:33:49,140 --> 00:33:50,760
Great Fall that is actually yes we really need to

843
00:33:50,760 --> 00:33:52,140
start on that

844
00:33:52,140 --> 00:33:54,179
from our sponsors our

845
00:33:54,179 --> 00:33:57,360
volunteers eh eh I I can eh

846
00:33:57,360 --> 00:34:00,419
make a claim and say Yes eh I

847
00:34:00,419 --> 00:34:02,120
would like to have the very best stuff

848
00:34:02,120 --> 00:34:06,299
give me eh 5 million eh yes then I must

849
00:34:06,299 --> 00:34:07,559
have someone who could bring that to me

850
00:34:07,559 --> 00:34:09,119
and that usually doesn't just happen

851
00:34:09,119 --> 00:34:11,879
blowing in eh so we should have more often

852
00:34:11,879 --> 00:34:13,139
for people who say I still have

853
00:34:13,139 --> 00:34:15,780
some Services against I still have eh some

854
00:34:15,780 --> 00:34:17,820
second hand network equipment that we

855
00:34:17,820 --> 00:34:19,679
don't use anymore but it's quite

856
00:34:19,679 --> 00:34:23,940
eh recently modern eh put it in Well then

857
00:34:23,940 --> 00:34:25,440
we'll also look at  be able to put in something

858
00:34:25,440 --> 00:34:28,080
Yes and the next

859
00:34:28,080 --> 00:34:30,418
step is really ehm in

860
00:34:30,418 --> 00:34:31,679
professionalization because this

861
00:34:31,679 --> 00:34:32,879
naturally follows the rest of the

862
00:34:32,879 --> 00:34:35,159
organization so while the rest of the

863
00:34:35,159 --> 00:34:38,879
organization grows from eh 0 or 0.1 to

864
00:34:38,879 --> 00:34:40,980
that point zero soon we will walk  in the

865
00:34:40,980 --> 00:34:42,300
background along with the infrastructure

866
00:34:42,300 --> 00:34:44,760
and new iterations are always

867
00:34:44,760 --> 00:34:47,820
needed ehm so we are already thinking

868
00:34:47,820 --> 00:34:50,520
ahead Well we want to

869
00:34:50,520 --> 00:34:52,619
have hardware that is supported

870
00:34:52,619 --> 00:34:56,159
eh eh for which we can get eh decent eh

871
00:34:56,159 --> 00:34:57,540
spare parts

872
00:34:57,540 --> 00:35:01,680
if things break down  eh eh we have

873
00:35:01,680 --> 00:35:03,780
luckily and that is perhaps the

874
00:35:03,780 --> 00:35:06,720
biggest profit eh are an awful lot

875
00:35:06,720 --> 00:35:08,700
eh if you look carefully you can

876
00:35:08,700 --> 00:35:10,079
find a lot of parties also large

877
00:35:10,079 --> 00:35:13,680
parties eh who eh want to

878
00:35:13,680 --> 00:35:16,140
contribute to this concept eh we have

879
00:35:16,140 --> 00:35:17,640
a nice deal for example  with the

880
00:35:17,640 --> 00:35:19,980
lestic who or she will

881
00:35:19,980 --> 00:35:22,099
just give everything for nothing for the next 5 years just

882
00:35:22,099 --> 00:35:25,020
crazy but as much as you want pack it up for

883
00:35:25,020 --> 00:35:27,660
what you want me to do well

884
00:35:27,660 --> 00:35:28,680
we really need those kinds of parties

885
00:35:28,680 --> 00:35:31,020
eh so we keep looking for that too

886
00:35:31,020 --> 00:35:33,839
and in the meantime we are certainly

887
00:35:33,839 --> 00:35:35,760
looking for more people to

888
00:35:35,760 --> 00:35:37,500
think along with, both in terms of

889
00:35:37,500 --> 00:35:41,579
architecture ehm but also eh eh donations

890
00:35:41,579 --> 00:35:46,079
eh eh purchase of new hardware eh we

891
00:35:46,079 --> 00:35:47,280
eventually want to

892
00:35:47,280 --> 00:35:48,839
scale up to multiple data centers

893
00:35:48,839 --> 00:35:50,339
so that we are also a bit redundit in there

894
00:35:50,339 --> 00:35:53,940
erm yes so that uh that is

895
00:35:53,940 --> 00:35:55,020
all going on at the moment with us in

896
00:35:55,020 --> 00:35:57,320
the It and in the meantime we try to keep this uh

897
00:35:57,320 --> 00:35:59,940
yes again as safe as possible

898
00:35:59,940 --> 00:36:01,920
for everyone who

899
00:36:01,920 --> 00:36:04,440
works with it  and thus also to be able to show our

900
00:36:04,440 --> 00:36:08,940
partners and our reporting agents

901
00:36:08,940 --> 00:36:10,619


902
00:36:10,619 --> 00:36:12,660
that we also do it in a professional

903
00:36:12,660 --> 00:36:14,520
manner that it all registers

904
00:36:14,520 --> 00:36:16,859
and logs and that we are therefore also an

905
00:36:16,859 --> 00:36:18,240
organization that you can

906
00:36:18,240 --> 00:36:20,460
rely on if things go wrong in

907
00:36:20,460 --> 00:36:22,339
just calling us  then you can call Chris or

908
00:36:22,339 --> 00:36:25,020
call Frank you

909
00:36:25,020 --> 00:36:26,760
probably call Frank you probably call Frank as a mishate

910
00:36:26,760 --> 00:36:28,980
then Frank calls me and he says you it's

911
00:36:28,980 --> 00:36:30,359
going completely wrong and then you say well I'll

912
00:36:30,359 --> 00:36:31,800
get some logs out of the system and

913
00:36:31,800 --> 00:36:32,940
then we can see what's going on  is going on

914
00:36:32,940 --> 00:36:36,079
that actually comes down to

915
00:36:36,079 --> 00:36:39,119
Thank you ehm not very

916
00:36:39,119 --> 00:36:40,380
important We also have our own

917
00:36:40,380 --> 00:36:42,780
ashes there Oh elg that is now going upstairs by the way

918
00:36:42,780 --> 00:36:44,280
He is the boss of

919
00:36:44,280 --> 00:36:45,780
internet security that shelter this one actually does

920
00:36:45,780 --> 00:36:48,180
something similar to us so go to

921
00:36:48,180 --> 00:36:50,400
this one  tork also definitely look at elger and

922
00:36:50,400 --> 00:36:52,560
we also work with him to

923
00:36:52,560 --> 00:36:53,940


924
00:36:53,940 --> 00:36:56,640
our own A.S why would that be eh

925
00:36:56,640 --> 00:36:59,359
relevant

926
00:36:59,700 --> 00:37:01,560
Take downs

927
00:37:01,560 --> 00:37:03,780
piping

928
00:37:03,780 --> 00:37:06,359
indeed come on the allolist eh because

929
00:37:06,359 --> 00:37:08,040
yes as soon as you get cozy it quickly gets

930
00:37:08,040 --> 00:37:10,320
blocked eh we used to go through

931
00:37:10,320 --> 00:37:11,640
proxies I want it falls I would

932
00:37:11,640 --> 00:37:12,900
have there you have here the Russians

933
00:37:12,900 --> 00:37:16,560
away from me again now we advertise ip series

934
00:37:16,560 --> 00:37:19,200
so much that they are with eh so put us

935
00:37:19,200 --> 00:37:20,780
on the arrest is not on the block lust

936
00:37:20,780 --> 00:37:23,520
and eh well this eh is now running at

937
00:37:23,520 --> 00:37:27,140
drivers eh and well Olof very real eh

938
00:37:27,140 --> 00:37:31,079
Job you guys are doing fantastic

939
00:37:31,079 --> 00:37:34,040
Yes that's right

940
00:37:36,800 --> 00:37:38,760
so we're looking to have it

941
00:37:38,760 --> 00:37:40,859
set new so if anyone has any data accents

942
00:37:40,859 --> 00:37:44,040
and eh our help then we can

943
00:37:44,040 --> 00:37:46,200
put [ __ ] with you and I'm willing to pay for

944
00:37:46,200 --> 00:37:48,680


945
00:37:53,839 --> 00:37:56,280
it It's been  another upgrade the step of

946
00:37:56,280 --> 00:37:58,260
professionalization eh That's its

947
00:37:58,260 --> 00:38:00,960
own axis with IP already and this is

948
00:38:00,960 --> 00:38:03,060
really [ __ ] bothering We are recognized as

949
00:38:03,060 --> 00:38:07,440
c&a the cave numbering Authority so

950
00:38:07,440 --> 00:38:10,079
we see that CVA leading in the past eh That's

951
00:38:10,079 --> 00:38:11,880
all difficult difficult and

952
00:38:11,880 --> 00:38:14,520
we can do that  so now do it yourself and that

953
00:38:14,520 --> 00:38:15,900
article is also there We are the first

954
00:38:15,900 --> 00:38:18,240
still about it in the Netherlands who can eh

955
00:38:18,240 --> 00:38:20,540
even earlier than tent sings

956
00:38:20,540 --> 00:38:22,320
strong Well I think when we

957
00:38:22,320 --> 00:38:23,820
became that there Why didn't we

958
00:38:23,820 --> 00:38:25,800
actually think about it go quickly us

959
00:38:25,800 --> 00:38:28,079
if cinar has

960
00:38:28,079 --> 00:38:30,839
something like that I think well and of course

961
00:38:30,839 --> 00:38:33,359
many more kezers I just put them on it just

962
00:38:33,359 --> 00:38:34,619
for fun they are legible

963
00:38:34,619 --> 00:38:36,720
but you have lost track a bit

964
00:38:36,720 --> 00:38:38,820
and now reflect from Leonard who

965
00:38:38,820 --> 00:38:40,859
will just go through all that choice under two weeks

966
00:38:40,859 --> 00:38:42,780
with all researchers from now

967
00:38:42,780 --> 00:38:45,300
Kees number so many Who are casey's Yes

968
00:38:45,300 --> 00:38:47,400
indeed oh yes scan turned and now

969
00:38:47,400 --> 00:38:49,260
able to get into it Ah they are

970
00:38:49,260 --> 00:38:50,820
very broke and now so many are

971
00:38:50,820 --> 00:38:53,339
vulnerable now sent Yes the first

972
00:38:53,339 --> 00:38:54,960
round of reports done nice next

973
00:38:54,960 --> 00:38:57,060
week again how is it going  Well the

974
00:38:57,060 --> 00:38:59,160
number of victims turns out to

975
00:38:59,160 --> 00:39:00,480
keep reporting themselves Well then it just stops with

976
00:39:00,480 --> 00:39:03,200
the following

977
00:39:03,200 --> 00:39:06,180
Basically that subcorbusiness

978
00:39:06,180 --> 00:39:08,460
you know is very exciting isn't it but is

979
00:39:08,460 --> 00:39:10,920
it incredibly important and then

980
00:39:10,920 --> 00:39:12,119
the number of research sees it's actually

981
00:39:12,119 --> 00:39:14,820
when she comes out with a resume High And  we

982
00:39:14,820 --> 00:39:16,560
can fingerprint we are the

983
00:39:16,560 --> 00:39:18,300
first on top

984
00:39:18,300 --> 00:39:20,760
so those numbers of ours are

985
00:39:20,760 --> 00:39:21,960
also getting more and more value from Hey

986
00:39:21,960 --> 00:39:25,040
this is really serious Well yes

987
00:39:26,099 --> 00:39:28,980
another upgrade eh got eh

988
00:39:28,980 --> 00:39:31,859
through eh this case yes and threatens

989
00:39:31,859 --> 00:39:34,020
to go horribly wrong And who  then call

990
00:39:34,020 --> 00:39:36,720
the crisis manager

991
00:39:36,720 --> 00:39:41,880
Yes and eh just our course Jelle ehm

992
00:39:41,880 --> 00:39:44,300
Jelle fital is something

993
00:39:44,300 --> 00:39:46,740
Jelly your Count that he had found from you

994
00:39:46,740 --> 00:39:48,380
then no problem

995
00:39:48,380 --> 00:39:51,420
in this case it was the super admin

996
00:39:51,420 --> 00:39:55,320
account of savan ehm

997
00:39:55,320 --> 00:39:57,060
by the way you don't have to worry

998
00:39:57,060 --> 00:39:58,800
to find this was eh not a real

999
00:39:58,800 --> 00:40:00,480
spare in the counter but one where eh

1000
00:40:00,480 --> 00:40:04,430
the solar panels of Buren eh [

1001
00:40:04,430 --> 00:40:05,820
Music]

1002
00:40:05,820 --> 00:40:07,560
because that is a back-and management

1003
00:40:07,560 --> 00:40:10,440
system for eh Solar panels inverter's

1004
00:40:10,440 --> 00:40:13,680
batteries and without a few small

1005
00:40:13,680 --> 00:40:16,700
solar parks in

1006
00:40:19,880 --> 00:40:23,780
a Kees that is important  is because we

1007
00:40:23,780 --> 00:40:27,480
were able to solve one by including

1008
00:40:27,480 --> 00:40:30,540
working together with tent cc and with China

1009
00:40:30,540 --> 00:40:34,680
shirt and that was really necessary because ehm

1010
00:40:34,680 --> 00:40:36,780
Yes the typical reaction from Tina is

1011
00:40:36,780 --> 00:40:38,900
this

1012
00:40:43,579 --> 00:40:48,300
and that then 3 months man ehm and

1013
00:40:48,300 --> 00:40:51,780
another is that this Kees has glid  to

1014
00:40:51,780 --> 00:40:54,300
questions in the room

1015
00:40:54,300 --> 00:40:56,640
ask in the camera for how it can

1016
00:40:56,640 --> 00:41:00,240
happen now but also ask in yes if

1017
00:41:00,240 --> 00:41:04,500
we don't talk about this is what we

1018
00:41:04,500 --> 00:41:06,359
found doesn't mean I

1019
00:41:06,359 --> 00:41:08,240


1020
00:41:08,240 --> 00:41:10,500
was here don't let it swallow around That

1021
00:41:10,500 --> 00:41:12,960
might mean the Kees wanted  is but

1022
00:41:12,960 --> 00:41:15,000
what do you really think about that well

1023
00:41:15,000 --> 00:41:16,980
things like this led to research in eh

1024
00:41:16,980 --> 00:41:19,320
to actually the room eh Audi that time

1025
00:41:19,320 --> 00:41:21,900
Telecom or inside new names just

1026
00:41:21,900 --> 00:41:24,140
lost the car

1027
00:41:24,140 --> 00:41:27,180
rdi Rex authority digital

1028
00:41:27,180 --> 00:41:28,320
instructor

1029
00:41:28,320 --> 00:41:32,460
yes no he was nowhere um ge  - not

1030
00:41:32,460 --> 00:41:34,920
crazy eh about that is amount of sleep eh

1031
00:41:34,920 --> 00:41:36,780
well he is now doing research

1032
00:41:36,780 --> 00:41:40,280
into eh yes solar panels eh

1033
00:41:40,280 --> 00:41:44,579
energy transition and yes why can this

1034
00:41:44,579 --> 00:41:47,099
go like this and eh well yes that is The Prelude to

1035
00:41:47,099 --> 00:41:49,920
more and more recognition and more and more

1036
00:41:49,920 --> 00:41:51,359
introduction in  eh in the official

1037
00:41:51,359 --> 00:41:53,660
processor

1038
00:41:54,380 --> 00:41:57,060
and is your job Yes he does the nice

1039
00:41:57,060 --> 00:41:59,760
job I do the eh boring job and eh

1040
00:41:59,760 --> 00:42:02,700
I like to do that too because I I'm an

1041
00:42:02,700 --> 00:42:04,440
electrician myself and when I saw this I'm

1042
00:42:04,440 --> 00:42:05,839
really sick I thought of

1043
00:42:05,839 --> 00:42:09,420
a million inverters

1044
00:42:09,420 --> 00:42:11,460
as  you're going to flip that on and off then

1045
00:42:11,460 --> 00:42:13,320
you can just shut down whole parts of the country

1046
00:42:13,320 --> 00:42:17,820
create blackout so this was

1047
00:42:17,820 --> 00:42:19,320
also really kind of an upgrade in the kind of

1048
00:42:19,320 --> 00:42:20,700
research we're doing it wasn't

1049
00:42:20,700 --> 00:42:22,619
just about information availability and

1050
00:42:22,619 --> 00:42:25,260
confidentiality and intelligence there No

1051
00:42:25,260 --> 00:42:28,320
it  was really also about the physical world well

1052
00:42:28,320 --> 00:42:30,000


1053
00:42:30,000 --> 00:42:33,119
a system now eh still about eh always

1054
00:42:33,119 --> 00:42:35,339
liked us also

1055
00:42:35,339 --> 00:42:37,500
signed a cooperation agreement and now

1056
00:42:37,500 --> 00:42:39,420
apply for a long time your finally

1057
00:42:39,420 --> 00:42:40,440
we were allowed to stand at the

1058
00:42:40,440 --> 00:42:42,060
residential conference for once because they could

1059
00:42:42,060 --> 00:42:44,040
n't get past us anymore people me at a

1060
00:42:44,040 --> 00:42:45,119
certain point  moment also jokes when they saw all

1061
00:42:45,119 --> 00:42:47,099
those black whole shirts in terms of is

1062
00:42:47,099 --> 00:42:48,900
now the housing concept or is this DVD

1063
00:42:48,900 --> 00:42:50,720
conference

1064
00:42:50,720 --> 00:42:53,460
and we are even in the wolf Fame yeah

1065
00:42:53,460 --> 00:42:55,619
as an organization only get

1066
00:42:55,619 --> 00:42:57,900
a nice t-shirt So then someone said from Well just do

1067
00:42:57,900 --> 00:42:59,040
a  it is very big it

1068
00:42:59,040 --> 00:43:01,640
will fit in there and then we got this flag

1069
00:43:01,640 --> 00:43:04,560
nice but the most important one

1070
00:43:04,560 --> 00:43:06,300
recognized from The Hague I still thought

1071
00:43:06,300 --> 00:43:07,980
this There

1072
00:43:07,980 --> 00:43:11,220
was a parliamentary debate uh After well

1073
00:43:11,220 --> 00:43:13,920
wbni scanning report who is allowed to do

1074
00:43:13,920 --> 00:43:15,900
that  not eh well then

1075
00:43:15,900 --> 00:43:18,960
after being called 9 times DVD eh by

1076
00:43:18,960 --> 00:43:21,480
MPs Yes DVD does this in DVD on which

1077
00:43:21,480 --> 00:43:23,220
they are not part of the government

1078
00:43:23,220 --> 00:43:25,560
and and that and that then he was very good

1079
00:43:25,560 --> 00:43:29,099
It was enough yes um you know they do

1080
00:43:29,099 --> 00:43:31,260
incredibly long work we  working with a

1081
00:43:31,260 --> 00:43:34,680
partner, but now the DVD is currently

1082
00:43:34,680 --> 00:43:36,420
in principle

1083
00:43:36,420 --> 00:43:38,220
entering an automated

1084
00:43:38,220 --> 00:43:39,660
network by scanning without a

1085
00:43:39,660 --> 00:43:40,859
criminal investigation being

1086
00:43:40,859 --> 00:43:43,079
launched against it it must already comply

1087
00:43:43,079 --> 00:43:44,220
with the directive of the Public Prosecution

1088
00:43:44,220 --> 00:43:46,520
Service with regard to a quick

1089
00:43:46,520 --> 00:43:49,140
look government organization must  having a legal

1090
00:43:49,140 --> 00:43:51,180
basis or getting

1091
00:43:51,180 --> 00:43:53,660
the person involved to penetrate

1092
00:43:53,660 --> 00:43:56,700
ehm different is the speech because criminal

1093
00:43:56,700 --> 00:43:57,720
action

1094
00:43:57,720 --> 00:44:00,260
that is quite a versil

1095
00:44:00,260 --> 00:44:02,280
and why am I so happy with this

1096
00:44:02,280 --> 00:44:04,020
here is just a Dutch

1097
00:44:04,020 --> 00:44:06,420
Minister of Justice who literally

1098
00:44:06,420 --> 00:44:10,260
says DVD is allowed  hacking and we don't

1099
00:44:10,260 --> 00:44:12,720
Yes, you know that is the best

1100
00:44:12,720 --> 00:44:14,940
recognition ever for me and that's why she said

1101
00:44:14,940 --> 00:44:16,560
they can't become part of the

1102
00:44:16,560 --> 00:44:18,000
Dutch government because we ca

1103
00:44:18,000 --> 00:44:20,420
n't do his work anymore

1104
00:44:20,700 --> 00:44:22,859
so

1105
00:44:22,859 --> 00:44:24,900
actually one who understands it right

1106
00:44:24,900 --> 00:44:29,000
Look now drafts  eh funny wooden eh

1107
00:44:29,000 --> 00:44:33,359
it's on criminal recognize eh Jannie She's

1108
00:44:33,359 --> 00:44:34,680
just literally going out with

1109
00:44:34,680 --> 00:44:36,140
the literal legal text

1110
00:44:36,140 --> 00:44:38,900
computer peacebreaking may be brought under this

1111
00:44:38,900 --> 00:44:43,319
well CD MPs that that's a

1112
00:44:43,319 --> 00:44:45,780
clear explanation Mrs Jesus eh but

1113
00:44:45,780 --> 00:44:49,500
can't they give money because yes these

1114
00:44:49,500 --> 00:44:50,940
are volunteers  but of

1115
00:44:50,940 --> 00:44:52,020
course you also need stuff a

1116
00:44:52,020 --> 00:44:55,680
desk servers and eh blue blah and eh

1117
00:44:55,680 --> 00:44:57,359
there with it this parliamentary motion has

1118
00:44:57,359 --> 00:44:58,800
been submitted

1119
00:44:58,800 --> 00:45:03,660
um about well yes paying ethical

1120
00:45:03,660 --> 00:45:05,640
hacker collectives I hope the

1121
00:45:05,640 --> 00:45:07,260
word gets in the dieuwer Van Dale that's

1122
00:45:07,260 --> 00:45:08,480
a bit weird  word but

1123
00:45:08,480 --> 00:45:11,040
we have not lobby's room in the bee

1124
00:45:11,040 --> 00:45:13,140
our prayer of No we think it's gifts

1125
00:45:13,140 --> 00:45:15,000
you do What do you want from us What

1126
00:45:15,000 --> 00:45:16,859
should we shout in room well while

1127
00:45:16,859 --> 00:45:18,300
I said well not become part of

1128
00:45:18,300 --> 00:45:20,220
government but recognition and that they

1129
00:45:20,220 --> 00:45:21,300
do something with  our data that is

1130
00:45:21,300 --> 00:45:22,859
most important and yes if you want to

1131
00:45:22,859 --> 00:45:27,000
give money fine um but you don't have to have a div

1132
00:45:27,000 --> 00:45:29,760
because then it will get stuck on it

1133
00:45:29,760 --> 00:45:31,740
hey makes another word of that

1134
00:45:31,740 --> 00:45:33,180
security can also get something for example

1135
00:45:33,180 --> 00:45:35,460
Okay well they have

1136
00:45:35,460 --> 00:45:37,260
made an ethical collective out of it  the

1137
00:45:37,260 --> 00:45:40,319
motion was passed the 128k members at 28

1138
00:45:40,319 --> 00:45:42,980
voted for

1139
00:45:45,380 --> 00:45:48,800
Yes I got it

1140
00:45:53,940 --> 00:45:57,359
well I thought it was already a lot of 128k suffering in

1141
00:45:57,359 --> 00:45:59,900
the room

1142
00:45:59,960 --> 00:46:02,160
that had never been occupied so yes

1143
00:46:02,160 --> 00:46:03,300
maybe the two have

1144
00:46:03,300 --> 00:46:05,099
opposed but at least a little

1145
00:46:05,099 --> 00:46:07,079
less and that with  so much it is

1146
00:46:07,079 --> 00:46:09,359
assumed that they have quite a bit

1147
00:46:09,359 --> 00:46:10,980
we are the further questions by the way

1148
00:46:10,980 --> 00:46:13,680
comment suggestions because this is a

1149
00:46:13,680 --> 00:46:15,240
bit of a crash test for eh next

1150
00:46:15,240 --> 00:46:17,520
week like going to Then and she says

1151
00:46:17,520 --> 00:46:18,780
well This I don't understand or that doesn't make sense

1152
00:46:18,780 --> 00:46:20,339
at all  then this is the time to

1153
00:46:20,339 --> 00:46:23,520
bug Yes that had but it

1154
00:46:23,520 --> 00:46:25,680
has not yet And there is not yet a hard

1155
00:46:25,680 --> 00:46:28,099
bed that says that What we do is still allowed

1156
00:46:28,099 --> 00:46:30,380
guidance and

1157
00:46:30,380 --> 00:46:33,180
a helping hand that is called from the

1158
00:46:33,180 --> 00:46:34,859
OM And that is based on legal

1159
00:46:34,859 --> 00:46:37,460
predilection so

1160
00:46:38,060 --> 00:46:40,680
Oh  yes sorry the question for the people

1161
00:46:40,680 --> 00:46:43,140
at home my questions was from eh the minister

1162
00:46:43,140 --> 00:46:45,839
who has made a statement but there

1163
00:46:45,839 --> 00:46:47,819
is clearly respite here and has it

1164
00:46:47,819 --> 00:46:49,560
already eh been converted to, for example, really

1165
00:46:49,560 --> 00:46:51,359
a law that really shields us exactly as

1166
00:46:51,359 --> 00:46:53,640
researchers so so it  has

1167
00:46:53,640 --> 00:46:55,740
not been a competition

1168
00:46:55,740 --> 00:46:58,800
well but in the Netherlands residence is

1169
00:46:58,800 --> 00:47:00,540
mainly the What is the name of the Go so his number of

1170
00:47:00,540 --> 00:47:03,319
cases have been Kunar Goed Hart Hospital

1171
00:47:03,319 --> 00:47:06,420
eh that jochnostiek for you and there

1172
00:47:06,420 --> 00:47:08,460
he has applied the judge so that critical year of

1173
00:47:08,460 --> 00:47:10,020
hacking this in a

1174
00:47:10,020 --> 00:47:11,700
public interest  done doll is now

1175
00:47:11,700 --> 00:47:14,400
time system Yes Henk Krol note legs

1176
00:47:14,400 --> 00:47:17,660
Anyway we are grateful with it ehm

1177
00:47:17,660 --> 00:47:21,240
and for that they dedicate to the so So eh

1178
00:47:21,240 --> 00:47:24,000
that it's about with that handshake

1179
00:47:24,000 --> 00:47:25,500
they gave to all the ornaments of Justice

1180
00:47:25,500 --> 00:47:26,700
It's just literally a

1181
00:47:26,700 --> 00:47:28,220
letter  from Hey officially from Justice

1182
00:47:28,220 --> 00:47:30,720
you get an er a report about a

1183
00:47:30,720 --> 00:47:32,700
hacker follows this

1184
00:47:32,700 --> 00:47:36,140
and then I will do what you can

1185
00:47:41,240 --> 00:47:43,680
still civil law where we

1186
00:47:43,680 --> 00:47:44,940
may run a risk that if we

1187
00:47:44,940 --> 00:47:46,800
push a scanner server around that

1188
00:47:46,800 --> 00:47:49,319
damage may occur Yes Can  we

1189
00:47:49,319 --> 00:47:51,240
ask for something of protection eh,

1190
00:47:51,240 --> 00:47:52,859
for example from a minister

1191
00:47:52,859 --> 00:47:57,319
or the DVD has a Cyber ​​insurance

1192
00:47:58,099 --> 00:48:01,200
seriously I don't think that will work

1193
00:48:01,200 --> 00:48:02,140
but we do have it

1194
00:48:02,140 --> 00:48:02,270
[Music]

1195
00:48:02,270 --> 00:48:05,839
[Laughter]

1196
00:48:05,839 --> 00:48:08,540
No but good

1197
00:48:08,540 --> 00:48:11,540
point

1198
00:48:15,740 --> 00:48:18,359
yes then finally Foundation

1199
00:48:18,359 --> 00:48:20,700
you don't do anything The researcher

1200
00:48:20,700 --> 00:48:22,079
himself and that is of course what you want to

1201
00:48:22,079 --> 00:48:23,880
prevent and of course

1202
00:48:23,880 --> 00:48:25,800
prevent that damage in the first place

1203
00:48:25,800 --> 00:48:27,300
Let's

1204
00:48:27,300 --> 00:48:29,819
be very clear about that eh and that well

1205
00:48:29,819 --> 00:48:30,960
there we have the Cote of condensation that are

1206
00:48:30,960 --> 00:48:31,980
the most important person for

1207
00:48:31,980 --> 00:48:33,900
that is that volunteer agreement

1208
00:48:33,900 --> 00:48:35,220
so important because you

1209
00:48:35,220 --> 00:48:36,720
signed it under the Koos can

1210
00:48:36,720 --> 00:48:38,280
press and as long as you

1211
00:48:38,280 --> 00:48:40,260
operate in there we can say who wants to Cove your

1212
00:48:40,260 --> 00:48:41,480
ass

1213
00:48:41,480 --> 00:48:43,619
against evil and you just

1214
00:48:43,619 --> 00:48:45,300
turn all things around then we can  say Yes

1215
00:48:45,300 --> 00:48:46,380
you don't need the code or comment

1216
00:48:46,380 --> 00:48:48,119
golden Hero you know That's how it works

1217
00:48:48,119 --> 00:48:50,420
well so

1218
00:48:50,420 --> 00:48:52,980
a lot of recognition from The Hague but also

1219
00:48:52,980 --> 00:48:55,440

1222
00:48:59,819 --> 00:49:02,940
interesting domain of dementia to it  oh no

jesualen lines Vulnerability eh in the

1231

zammel eh the blue stretchability in

1232
00:49:24,660 --> 00:49:28,560
the kitwave functionality ehm

1233
00:49:28,560 --> 00:49:30,420


1234
00:49:30,420 --> 00:49:31,440
awakening vulnerable rhymes from a while and at a certain moment I

1235
00:49:31,440 --> 00:49:35,520
started calling anyway eh Hey dear Inge

00:49:37,619 --> 00:49:40,740
to us ehm but ehm well we will

1238
00:49:40,740 --> 00:49:42,540
tap into that together eh so we

1239
00:49:42,540 --> 00:49:45,359
got the date of eh from Foxy tea and

1240
00:49:45,359 --> 00:49:48,480
we are eh We chanotify eh

1241
00:49:48,480 --> 00:49:50,280
and it has become quite a great

1242
00:49:50,280 --> 00:49:52,500
collaboration and  and the question is

1243
00:49:52,500 --> 00:49:54,900
Yes does that help

1244
00:49:54,900 --> 00:49:56,520
ehm the

1245
00:49:56,520 --> 00:49:59,160
first vertical line is ehm

1246
00:49:59,160 --> 00:50:01,500
publishing the advisory ehm you

1247
00:50:01,500 --> 00:50:02,880
also immediately see a eh in the Netherlands a

1248
00:50:02,880 --> 00:50:04,500
decent reaction right people who

1249
00:50:04,500 --> 00:50:08,160
fit awesome eh mainly make people sick the

1250
00:50:08,160 --> 00:50:09,960
people who did it quickly we'll see what

1251
00:50:09,960 --> 00:50:13,920
did later  the blue vertical line eh

1252
00:50:13,920 --> 00:50:16,200
is eh when foxity published the blockbus

1253
00:50:16,200 --> 00:50:18,540
about this nice

1254
00:50:18,540 --> 00:50:19,920
fantastic nice really not his article

1255
00:50:19,920 --> 00:50:22,200
about how to put that finger in

1256
00:50:22,200 --> 00:50:24,119
um and then we're another line on

1257
00:50:24,119 --> 00:50:25,319
a line warning us

1258
00:50:25,319 --> 00:50:26,880


1259
00:50:26,880 --> 00:50:28,740
what you see is that  there is clearly a

1260
00:50:28,740 --> 00:50:31,140
tren break when

1261
00:50:31,140 --> 00:50:33,480
we start to warn people and that

1262
00:50:33,480 --> 00:50:34,800
print break that you see me not only in the

1263
00:50:34,800 --> 00:50:37,500
Netherlands but we see it in the verse

1264
00:50:37,500 --> 00:50:39,000
also there it is listened to us

1265
00:50:39,000 --> 00:50:40,619


1266
00:50:40,619 --> 00:50:42,740
ehm merna Love The Swiss

1267
00:50:42,740 --> 00:50:45,540
that last one is good  really just a very

1268
00:50:45,540 --> 00:50:48,059
clear eh apparently it helps better

1269
00:50:48,059 --> 00:50:49,980
to switch around There is a problem

1270
00:50:49,980 --> 00:50:52,140
I'm with works less well than hey

1271
00:50:52,140 --> 00:50:54,180
Gullit must be sensitive to

1272
00:50:54,180 --> 00:50:56,400
ehm

1273
00:50:56,400 --> 00:51:00,839
kaday eh that also works for the

1274
00:51:00,839 --> 00:51:03,839
people here who work in Cyber ​​eh or

1275
00:51:03,839 --> 00:51:06,240
just do my company or eh research

1276
00:51:06,240 --> 00:51:09,660
ehm if you notice that you

1277
00:51:09,660 --> 00:51:10,980
have this kind of research from your employer

1278
00:51:10,980 --> 00:51:12,660
that you have at the address of things that

1279
00:51:12,660 --> 00:51:14,940
are vulnerable that is complicated for the employer to

1280
00:51:14,940 --> 00:51:16,319
do this because you

1281
00:51:16,319 --> 00:51:17,760
immediately get the question back of yes that

1282
00:51:17,760 --> 00:51:20,040
sign up for what we want to sell ehm

1283
00:51:20,040 --> 00:51:23,160
from DVD can we with credits with eh

1284
00:51:23,160 --> 00:51:25,500
if desired or without credits if

1285
00:51:25,500 --> 00:51:28,200
desired ehm making that report and

1286
00:51:28,200 --> 00:51:30,839
thereby also having an impact

1287
00:51:30,839 --> 00:51:36,440
has a question it always helps Yes but

1288
00:51:36,900 --> 00:51:40,140
zundappe oh no

1289
00:51:40,140 --> 00:51:44,660
ehm that or this there are

1290
00:51:46,260 --> 00:51:48,839
some parties in France a very

1291
00:51:48,839 --> 00:51:49,880
large

1292
00:51:49,880 --> 00:51:52,079
data center with the occasional cloud

1293
00:51:52,079 --> 00:51:55,880
indeed center ehm that eh that eh

1294
00:51:55,880 --> 00:51:57,839
consistently tells us that they do not

1295
00:51:57,839 --> 00:51:59,280
understand what they are saying that they do not

1296
00:51:59,280 --> 00:52:01,140
know which iPad that is with which customer

1297
00:52:01,140 --> 00:52:03,240
Eh and that we then

1298
00:52:03,240 --> 00:52:04,440
have to go to the form so that they

1299
00:52:04,440 --> 00:52:05,839
cannot do anything with it

1300
00:52:05,839 --> 00:52:09,920
It is largely due to

1301
00:52:10,800 --> 00:52:12,960
the wrong one Yes that is one of

1302
00:52:12,960 --> 00:52:14,400
those reasons and so we do indeed have to

1303
00:52:14,400 --> 00:52:17,099
fix that audio but indeed one

1304
00:52:17,099 --> 00:52:18,359
of the reasons why  we're

1305
00:52:18,359 --> 00:52:19,559
going to look at seats of the Global type whether we should see

1306
00:52:19,559 --> 00:52:23,760
if we can pass on that crowbar um

1307
00:52:23,760 --> 00:52:26,040
and then there's a Curious Case or

1308
00:52:26,040 --> 00:52:28,680
plus 86

1309
00:52:28,680 --> 00:52:31,680
or China Well the First Curious cass

1310
00:52:31,680 --> 00:52:33,240
is that graph that makes it bounce so nicely

1311
00:52:33,240 --> 00:52:35,700
eh yes eh the big firewall  or

1312
00:52:35,700 --> 00:52:37,800
China also falters then once eh

1313
00:52:37,800 --> 00:52:39,599
this is really just the big firewall this

1314
00:52:39,599 --> 00:52:41,460
eh this is a strange thing you see more often um

1315
00:52:41,460 --> 00:52:42,599


1316
00:52:42,599 --> 00:52:45,839
the result in China is this

1317
00:52:45,839 --> 00:52:47,160
if I may not be so clear so

1318
00:52:47,160 --> 00:52:48,599
I just added Trend tapes

1319
00:52:48,599 --> 00:52:51,480
They  it went down pretty nicely and that

1320
00:52:51,480 --> 00:52:53,579
we reported they don't go

1321
00:52:53,579 --> 00:52:54,680
down so nicely anymore

1322
00:52:54,680 --> 00:52:57,680
eh

1323
00:52:59,240 --> 00:53:02,540
worse instead of better or

1324
00:53:02,540 --> 00:53:05,640
if they put a few one of those two eh

1325
00:53:05,640 --> 00:53:08,819
I don't know but just show that

1326
00:53:08,819 --> 00:53:10,440
international cooperation is really very

1327
00:53:10,440 --> 00:53:12,420
important  is because you can also

1328
00:53:12,420 --> 00:53:14,520
really achieve effects effects through to China

1329
00:53:14,520 --> 00:53:17,460
and well

1330
00:53:17,460 --> 00:53:19,859
see this record again that we are

1331
00:53:19,859 --> 00:53:23,940
now sematic version 253 ehm and

1332
00:53:23,940 --> 00:53:25,800
and Yes it's about time for the

1333
00:53:25,800 --> 00:53:28,339
next upgrade

1334
00:53:29,099 --> 00:53:31,280
and I can do that  do it again eh Yes

1335
00:53:31,280 --> 00:53:34,800
because yes recognition from the government eh what

1336
00:53:34,800 --> 00:53:36,599
got some money for an EMTÉ eh

1337
00:53:36,599 --> 00:53:38,040
Sounds for business but

1338
00:53:38,040 --> 00:53:40,940
above all and then it is always about growth

1339
00:53:40,940 --> 00:53:45,240
we are now with 120 and then you also get

1340
00:53:45,240 --> 00:53:48,680
that yes not everyone knows each other eh

1341
00:53:48,680 --> 00:53:51,780
apologies yesterday I walk to Mark

1342
00:53:51,780 --> 00:53:53,940
from Hey you have a DVD how to who

1343
00:53:53,940 --> 00:53:55,579
are you

1344
00:53:55,579 --> 00:54:00,319
Ah then I feel really stupid eh

1345
00:54:00,319 --> 00:54:03,480
yes you know I always attend those meetings

1346
00:54:03,480 --> 00:54:05,660
but now there are the 60

1347
00:54:05,660 --> 00:54:08,700
pictures that talk over each other and

1348
00:54:08,700 --> 00:54:10,740
if you see those real life yes then

1349
00:54:10,740 --> 00:54:14,880
you don't always know it ehm so you

1350
00:54:14,880 --> 00:54:16,980
really have to keep things together eh so I'm

1351
00:54:16,980 --> 00:54:19,640
also putting in more and more eh time and yes

1352
00:54:19,640 --> 00:54:22,020
just want to create space where these

1353
00:54:22,020 --> 00:54:24,240
people can do that and so on

1354
00:54:24,240 --> 00:54:27,059
possibly being bothered by the outside world

1355
00:54:27,059 --> 00:54:31,859
so yes back ehm to the drawing board because

1356
00:54:31,859 --> 00:54:36,359
what we had built up first this is

1357
00:54:36,359 --> 00:54:39,420
with an MT What then if vlietlands

1358
00:54:39,420 --> 00:54:41,220
is paid for hours a week or so

1359
00:54:41,220 --> 00:54:44,280
it's not really much that

1360
00:54:44,280 --> 00:54:47,540
it all went to the tax authorities

1361
00:54:47,819 --> 00:54:50,520
so that was  design error and it was also

1362
00:54:50,520 --> 00:54:52,619
just a one-time subsidy that ends and

1363
00:54:52,619 --> 00:54:55,920
yes you have to do something

1364
00:54:55,920 --> 00:54:57,180
it's in a few weeks we will go to

1365
00:54:57,180 --> 00:54:59,540
then with food drawing

1366
00:54:59,540 --> 00:55:02,940
and then with the message from van Hey

1367
00:55:02,940 --> 00:55:05,400
this all just has to be people who

1368
00:55:05,400 --> 00:55:06,319
come for a service

1369
00:55:06,319 --> 00:55:08,760
Eh I don't think we should employ all the investigations

1370
00:55:08,760 --> 00:55:10,319
if that's not

1371
00:55:10,319 --> 00:55:12,359
affordable B It's mainly about

1372
00:55:12,359 --> 00:55:14,400
you doing the intense motivation

1373
00:55:14,400 --> 00:55:16,859
uh to save the world and also just

1374
00:55:16,859 --> 00:55:19,800
your creativity in it and the comment that

1375
00:55:19,800 --> 00:55:21,240
I hear very often  during the meeting

1376
00:55:21,240 --> 00:55:23,520
is well I'm not going to do that because then

1377
00:55:23,520 --> 00:55:26,160
the network is I'm watching that's why we're doing

1378
00:55:26,160 --> 00:55:27,960
this huh people don't experience this even though

1379
00:55:27,960 --> 00:55:30,000
people experience this as satisfaction if

1380
00:55:30,000 --> 00:55:32,400
if freedom if creativity is so

1381
00:55:32,400 --> 00:55:34,680
edited can't do it but maybe

1382
00:55:34,680 --> 00:55:37,020
1  10 researchers are paid eh

1383
00:55:37,020 --> 00:55:39,059
a bit of continuity to keep going

1384
00:55:39,059 --> 00:55:42,540
that kind of thing eh

1385
00:55:42,540 --> 00:55:43,920
Well and then of course we also have

1386
00:55:43,920 --> 00:55:45,720
this Reusel

1387
00:55:45,720 --> 00:55:49,619
I hope that will work 3.0 eh it

1388
00:55:49,619 --> 00:55:51,559
's all just set up

1389
00:55:51,559 --> 00:55:53,579
to maybe kind of Global or that

1390
00:55:53,579 --> 00:55:55,559
global eh that will be  really a

1391
00:55:55,559 --> 00:55:58,140
gigantic job eh Academy that is going

1392
00:55:58,140 --> 00:55:59,359
well

1393
00:55:59,359 --> 00:56:01,099
so

1394
00:56:01,099 --> 00:56:03,359
just looking for it a bit and from

1395
00:56:03,359 --> 00:56:05,099
this workshop it will be over soon

1396
00:56:05,099 --> 00:56:06,660
but it will also come down to a cool

1397
00:56:06,660 --> 00:56:08,280
idea to do it differently

1398
00:56:08,280 --> 00:56:11,640
it It's all in the

1399
00:56:11,640 --> 00:56:14,220
framing of  Who do we belong to What do

1400
00:56:14,220 --> 00:56:16,140
we call ourselves

1401
00:56:16,140 --> 00:56:17,940
So when I go to then in a week

1402
00:56:17,940 --> 00:56:19,800
says well do you see us as an

1403
00:56:19,800 --> 00:56:22,380
aid organization Join the fire brigade

1404
00:56:22,380 --> 00:56:25,079
Do you also have one in 10 fire brigade people

1405
00:56:25,079 --> 00:56:26,880
then someone who is employed the

1406
00:56:26,880 --> 00:56:28,559
other 9  are volunteers and they

1407
00:56:28,559 --> 00:56:30,480
just do it eh for satisfaction

1408
00:56:30,480 --> 00:56:33,000
world save doing fun things eh

1409
00:56:33,000 --> 00:56:34,980
money also for Red Cross and the

1410
00:56:34,980 --> 00:56:36,059
Royal Dutch

1411
00:56:36,059 --> 00:56:38,040
rescue society but then you have to

1412
00:56:38,040 --> 00:56:39,480
have a professional sandwich with

1413
00:56:39,480 --> 00:56:43,140
all the bells and whistles on it

1414
00:56:43,140 --> 00:56:44,880
also look at libraries for example

1415
00:56:44,880 --> 00:56:46,079
you think Huh but they also have

1416
00:56:46,079 --> 00:56:48,300
a lot of volunteers eh look at that

1417
00:56:48,300 --> 00:56:49,680
for example How does a

1418
00:56:49,680 --> 00:56:51,780
volunteer coordinator work eh That's what

1419
00:56:51,780 --> 00:56:53,160
we should actually be doing is with so many

1420
00:56:53,160 --> 00:56:55,020
people that you can't just say

1421
00:56:55,020 --> 00:56:56,940
HRM This is a completely different kind of

1422
00:56:56,940 --> 00:57:00,119
hair emita you know  doing it ehm

1423
00:57:00,119 --> 00:57:02,579
yes the fences Spaces Yes some are

1424
00:57:02,579 --> 00:57:04,260
association I think that doesn't work

1425
00:57:04,260 --> 00:57:06,540
for us my foundation some effective

1426
00:57:06,540 --> 00:57:09,119
works but yes they know best

1427
00:57:09,119 --> 00:57:11,220
that hacker culture survive so

1428
00:57:11,220 --> 00:57:13,920
we also look at how that works yes

1429
00:57:13,920 --> 00:57:15,780
and Shadow  server Yes, that is actually a

1430
00:57:15,780 --> 00:57:17,940
kind of competitor of ours they have to

1431
00:57:17,940 --> 00:57:20,280
keep us then too,

1432
00:57:20,280 --> 00:57:22,640
so

1433
00:57:22,740 --> 00:57:27,078
think along about how we ehm

1434
00:57:27,720 --> 00:57:30,900
What is it called ehm yes me People if you

1435
00:57:30,900 --> 00:57:32,579
can keep on board while we

1436
00:57:32,579 --> 00:57:34,980
are going to professionalize things eh That

1437
00:57:34,980 --> 00:57:36,540
means more rules more hassle

1438
00:57:36,540 --> 00:57:38,000
will see more marriage

1439
00:57:38,000 --> 00:57:41,040
but they also help in the growth we are

1440
00:57:41,040 --> 00:57:42,960
all experiencing So what we are

1441

00:59:11,400 --> 00:59:14,940
Ehm He is a bit

1480
00:59:14,940 --> 00:59:16,619
shy about well I have  already an idea

1481
00:59:16,619 --> 00:59:18,359
but not now we are still here all the

1482
00:59:18,359 --> 00:59:21,119
time eh come to us eh but

1483
00:59:21,119 --> 00:59:22,020
maybe people now

1484
00:59:22,020 --> 00:59:25,319
have suggestions for DVD 3.0 to do that well

1485
00:59:25,319 --> 00:59:28,920
yes the microphone for the

1486
00:59:28,920 --> 00:59:30,780
people at home

1487
00:59:30,780 --> 00:59:33,359
um if you volunteer all the way  you

1488
00:59:33,359 --> 00:59:34,740
can also do it from

1489
00:59:34,740 --> 00:59:37,260
abroad It is a very good question

1490
00:59:37,260 --> 00:59:39,960
We have had quite an extensive

1491
00:59:39,960 --> 00:59:42,359
discussion about that because of course you have

1492
00:59:42,359 --> 00:59:43,559
that if someone

1493
00:59:43,559 --> 00:59:44,720
is abroad it

1494
00:59:44,720 --> 00:59:46,859
is difficult to screen that person

1495
00:59:46,859 --> 00:59:49,140
eh yes if you join we will go

1496
00:59:49,140 --> 00:59:51,119
seeing who you are eh as someone who

1497
00:59:51,119 --> 00:59:54,359
is abroad that is difficult eh but on

1498
00:59:54,359 --> 00:59:56,280
the other hand you just need those people

1499
00:59:56,280 --> 00:59:57,859
eh

1500
00:59:57,859 --> 01:00:00,720
David grows with diversity people who

1501
01:00:00,720 --> 01:00:02,760
new forms of kwest-beheid new

1502
01:00:02,760 --> 01:00:05,640
forms of scanning also know eh know the

1503
01:00:05,640 --> 01:00:07,500
local culture and you  can it also

1504
01:00:07,500 --> 01:00:10,799
reverse that if those people can't come to us

1505
01:00:10,799 --> 01:00:12,660
then what are they going to do what they are

1506
01:00:12,660 --> 01:00:14,880
doing anyway so that's actually

1507
01:00:14,880 --> 01:00:17,400
our mission worthy to get that armband

1508
01:00:17,400 --> 01:00:20,280
to prevent the

1509
01:00:20,280 --> 01:00:21,839
problems from coming or the internet a

1510
01:00:21,839 --> 01:00:23,460
problem coming through  those people so yes

1511
01:00:23,460 --> 01:00:24,420
we are going to do that

1512
01:00:24,420 --> 01:00:26,280
we have to set that up very well with their

1513
01:00:26,280 --> 01:00:29,640
own environment eh so that they ca

1514
01:00:29,640 --> 01:00:31,680
n't just run through dvd.nl

1515
01:00:31,680 --> 01:00:34,799
but are really top tenerized

1516
01:00:34,799 --> 01:00:37,559
maybe also per country eh that applies to

1517
01:00:37,559 --> 01:00:38,819
the people who live abroad  living and working

1518
01:00:38,819 --> 01:00:42,599
Well and within the Netherlands yes Eh you can

1519
01:00:42,599 --> 01:00:44,520
say from eh that boy is from

1520
01:00:44,520 --> 01:00:47,400
Russia or from China is not allowed But yes

1521
01:00:47,400 --> 01:00:51,119
if he works around them eh article one

1522
01:00:51,119 --> 01:00:52,920
of the constitution of people not the

1523
01:00:52,920 --> 01:00:54,180
discriminatory again origin so they have to

1524
01:00:54,180 --> 01:00:55,980
go  at and that is one day practical

1525
01:00:55,980 --> 01:00:58,260
difference eh do everything with Dutch or

1526
01:00:58,260 --> 01:00:59,950
also in English eh

1527
01:00:59,950 --> 01:01:01,319
[Music]

1528
01:01:01,319 --> 01:01:03,720
so yes eh we also have

1529
01:01:03,720 --> 01:01:06,480
screens method for that eh so yes good

1530
01:01:06,480 --> 01:01:09,000
question and it will happen now and Suzuki

1531
01:01:09,000 --> 01:01:11,220
so yes

1532
01:01:11,220 --> 01:01:12,900
further comments  suggestions

1533
01:01:12,900 --> 01:01:15,240
theories

1534
01:01:15,240 --> 01:01:17,299
explode Yes Jonathan

1535
01:01:17,299 --> 01:01:20,760
ehm the intention is to be able to scan

1536
01:01:20,760 --> 01:01:22,440
the surface of the internet as well as possible

1537
01:01:22,440 --> 01:01:24,180
and I just saw that graph of

1538
01:01:24,180 --> 01:01:27,599
that Great firewall eh joina and then

1539
01:01:27,599 --> 01:01:28,799
I think to him we shouldn't

1540
01:01:28,799 --> 01:01:31,079
just have servers there that run from

1541
01:01:31,079 --> 01:01:33,180
scanning the country now you immediately come to a

1542
01:01:33,180 --> 01:01:35,220
very stressful area because that will be legally

1543
01:01:35,220 --> 01:01:37,380
complicated because hey we have those I wanted

1544
01:01:37,380 --> 01:01:38,880
money there and so on and those

1545
01:01:38,880 --> 01:01:40,920
volunteers who are there who

1546
01:01:40,920 --> 01:01:42,839
help us How do we do that do we

1547
01:01:42,839 --> 01:01:44,700
still need help there that there are people  are

1548
01:01:44,700 --> 01:01:45,900
there teeth or should we not

1549
01:01:45,900 --> 01:01:48,299
create bears slower good is that 6.0

1550
01:01:48,299 --> 01:01:50,220
Well the legal part I do that

1551
01:01:50,220 --> 01:01:53,040
you do the technical part eh legal eh

1552
01:01:53,040 --> 01:01:54,299
I've asked that a few times from

1553
01:01:54,299 --> 01:01:57,059
Suppose we scan the entire internet and

1554
01:01:57,059 --> 01:02:00,059
someone sees that as crime  What

1555
01:02:00,059 --> 01:02:02,819
exactly is crime scene then is that

1556
01:02:02,819 --> 01:02:04,680
where the person is scanned in the US

1557
01:02:04,680 --> 01:02:05,819
from there you get the most loins

1558
01:02:05,819 --> 01:02:07,920
of course or is that where the

1559
01:02:07,920 --> 01:02:11,040
server is eh Schiphol rack eh or

1560
01:02:11,040 --> 01:02:13,740
in between and eh well the answer is

1561
01:02:13,740 --> 01:02:16,440
usually eh that  Paul the one who sues

1562
01:02:16,440 --> 01:02:19,619
or the vjs how you

1563
01:02:19,619 --> 01:02:20,880
are going to do that technically I think it's very smart to

1564
01:02:20,880 --> 01:02:23,040
indeed put those servers on eh in the country itself

1565
01:02:23,040 --> 01:02:24,599
but I know if that's a good

1566
01:02:24,599 --> 01:02:27,000
idea Frank look I also think there's a

1567
01:02:27,000 --> 01:02:28,859
very big one here  for Caesar Global ehm

1568
01:02:28,859 --> 01:02:30,780
because you are just really sitting with your

1569
01:02:30,780 --> 01:02:33,420
student Ehm look in America there is still

1570
01:02:33,420 --> 01:02:35,460
the culture that eh there are still people

1571
01:02:35,460 --> 01:02:37,079
just saying There is no such things

1572
01:02:37,079 --> 01:02:42,260
article hacking ehm yes ehm

1573
01:02:42,599 --> 01:02:44,760
I don't think that's fighting like that ehm

1574
01:02:44,760 --> 01:02:46,559
other people think so  more fun eh

1575
01:02:46,559 --> 01:02:50,099
You really just have to the the the so eh yes

1576
01:02:50,099 --> 01:02:51,599
in case schizoen Global is really

1577
01:02:51,599 --> 01:02:54,299
a eh really eh the place to join then

1578
01:02:54,299 --> 01:02:56,700
to

1579
01:02:56,700 --> 01:02:57,960
see what we can do together there but it would

1580
01:02:57,960 --> 01:03:01,920
be ours if  we ehm from all over the

1581
01:03:01,920 --> 01:03:04,140
world could scan

1582
01:03:04,140 --> 01:03:07,200
could have a lot of perspective Ehm

1583
01:03:07,200 --> 01:03:12,540
but ehm yes a Chinese dvd dvd.cm

1584
01:03:12,540 --> 01:03:15,180
I don't see it happening very soon eh but

1585
01:03:15,180 --> 01:03:18,078
how well

1586
01:03:19,980 --> 01:03:22,799
China has to stand now that

1587
01:03:22,799 --> 01:03:24,299
is a lot inside Flint that  you

1588
01:03:24,299 --> 01:03:26,099
first [ __ ] disclose them to the

1589
01:03:26,099 --> 01:03:27,780
government and then go ahead So you

1590
01:03:27,780 --> 01:03:30,540
get her all my complex thing so that

1591
01:03:30,540 --> 01:03:32,339
's bad for his extreme true America to set an

1592
01:03:32,339 --> 01:03:34,200
example a lot of banks

1593
01:03:34,200 --> 01:03:36,599
have completely shielded their uh their infrastructure

1594
01:03:36,599 --> 01:03:38,220
from only

1595
01:03:38,220 --> 01:03:40,140
people who live in America  sit like you

1596
01:03:40,140 --> 01:03:41,819
want to scan on the investment of

1597
01:03:41,819 --> 01:03:43,920
that bank you must have in vps or something in

1598
01:03:43,920 --> 01:03:45,299
America Otherwise you won't see it from the

1599
01:03:45,299 --> 01:03:47,640
Netherlands eh and those are

1600
01:03:47,640 --> 01:03:48,900
still a nice challenge to take a look

1601
01:03:48,900 --> 01:03:50,640
wherever How can we do that but

1602
01:03:50,640 --> 01:03:52,619
sinceorgen and how are we going How are

1603
01:03:52,619 --> 01:03:55,819
we going to keep it recognizable stabbing other

1604
01:03:55,819 --> 01:04:00,059
IP address eh broadcasting falls I now understand

1605
01:04:00,059 --> 01:04:01,859
Is that for sale so indeed worldwide

1606
01:04:01,859 --> 01:04:03,540
if we protect not just the

1607
01:04:03,540 --> 01:04:04,799
Netherlands

1608
01:04:04,799 --> 01:04:07,740
eh another question is eh at the moment

1609
01:04:07,740 --> 01:04:10,319
there is a lot of  scanned but is also

1610
01:04:10,319 --> 01:04:12,000
something with honeypods or the other way around

1611
01:04:12,000 --> 01:04:13,619
that you just sit down somewhere

1612
01:04:13,619 --> 01:04:16,500
and wait for someone to come along to your

1613
01:04:16,500 --> 01:04:19,440
per e version that hasn't been bullied we we

1614
01:04:19,440 --> 01:04:22,319
have a lot this is this is an

1615
01:04:22,319 --> 01:04:24,839
area what kind of slow bit  when eh

1616
01:04:24,839 --> 01:04:26,760
bit scanning are looking for the lines are

1617
01:04:26,760 --> 01:04:28,500
eh linseed

1618
01:04:28,500 --> 01:04:30,480
sometimes find the lines before erasing and

1619
01:04:30,480 --> 01:04:33,260
again eh drawing new but

1620
01:04:33,260 --> 01:04:35,220
in the end you have to say that we

1621
01:04:35,220 --> 01:04:36,839
are going for it We are doing well and we

1622
01:04:36,839 --> 01:04:38,520
are not a crime

1623
01:04:38,520 --> 01:04:41,700
fighting organization  ehm wants to

1624
01:04:41,700 --> 01:04:43,440
make the internet safer we think that

1625
01:04:43,440 --> 01:04:45,119
the safe internet ensures that

1626
01:04:45,119 --> 01:04:46,740
it makes it more difficult for the people who eh don't

1627
01:04:46,740 --> 01:04:49,619
handle it properly who can see it in terms of yes

1628
01:04:49,619 --> 01:04:51,140
eh

1629
01:04:51,140 --> 01:04:53,520
only when you really actively

1630
01:04:53,520 --> 01:04:55,260
engage 8 criminals do you come  another

1631
01:04:55,260 --> 01:04:56,520
game rightly

1632
01:04:56,520 --> 01:04:59,460
erm It is being canceled also a very

1633
01:04:59,460 --> 01:05:01,980
important one Well look at that erm the

1634
01:05:01,980 --> 01:05:06,740
ocean pulled that uh wash that assignment

1635
01:05:06,740 --> 01:05:08,880
that's not what we're for We're for

1636
01:05:08,880 --> 01:05:11,420
friends of vulnerabilities in it erm

1637
01:05:11,420 --> 01:05:14,280
I'll never rule it out no but for now

1638
01:05:14,280 --> 01:05:15,960
I think you should

1639
01:05:15,960 --> 01:05:18,000
stay with us for a while we are good at it eh and and

1640
01:05:18,000 --> 01:05:20,400
that there is still enough to scan eh and

1641
01:05:20,400 --> 01:05:21,839
that there is still enough- enough can you already see

1642
01:05:21,839 --> 01:05:23,940
from scanning is the good thing when

1643
01:05:23,940 --> 01:05:25,260
there is so  scanning few signals

1644
01:05:25,260 --> 01:05:26,700
is that the whole

1645
01:05:26,700 --> 01:05:29,160
problem also goes down a lot

1646
01:05:29,160 --> 01:05:30,900
because then eh yes we only have

1647
01:05:30,900 --> 01:05:34,200
port 44-3 and eh and and 25 on the

1648
01:05:34,200 --> 01:05:36,119
internet that eh to it would

1649
01:05:36,119 --> 01:05:37,859
become a lot more secure  We

1650
01:05:37,859 --> 01:05:39,359
often get Malle in on our

1651
01:05:39,359 --> 01:05:41,280
sees we see the railbox and then we sandbox

1652
01:05:41,280 --> 01:05:42,540
that and then if it doesn't have anyone anything to

1653
01:05:42,540 --> 01:05:44,099
do we actually sit your jolo eh

1654
01:05:44,099 --> 01:05:46,700
on it

1655
01:05:52,400 --> 01:05:55,200
and that is often for prioritizing

1656
01:05:55,200 --> 01:05:57,420
keesers so oh [ __ ] This is now  really

1657

1658
01:06:00,359 --> 01:06:03,299
little faster Yes part of

1659
01:06:03,299 --> 01:06:04,980
the Intel not not of the notifications
