1
00:00:00,459 --> 00:00:03,300
who before we start

2
00:00:03,300 --> 00:00:06,970
next time which will apparently future
lifetimes

3
00:00:06,970 --> 00:00:10,420
I just wanted to dance the Texans

4
00:00:10,420 --> 00:00:15,089

5
00:00:15,089 --> 00:00:18,320
right after the stop

6
00:00:18,320 --> 00:00:21,380
actually hugh

7
00:00:21,380 --> 00:00:25,070
we with Collingwood region

8
00:00:25,070 --> 00:00:29,150
too few structure and its security

9
00:00:29,150 --> 00:00:34,110
mentions yeah

10
00:00:34,110 --> 00:00:37,510
things went in to see me the from

11
00:00:37,510 --> 00:00:41,040
seemed has prevented

12
00:00:41,040 --> 00:00:44,219
much isolated you don't you

13
00:00:44,219 --> 00:00:45,940
just too

14
00:00:45,940 --> 00:00:49,000
if have sums step back to the don't

15
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:52,120
this morning so this is actually

16
00:00:52,120 --> 00:00:56,570
something similar but i've seen last
you're interested

17
00:00:56,570 --> 00:01:00,610
two hours misty and actually this is a

18
00:01:00,610 --> 00:01:04,080
tens so it's at 12 into

19
00:01:04,080 --> 00:01:07,700
which he said for 3G and

20
00:01:07,700 --> 00:01:11,780
for the LT and be running the software

21
00:01:11,780 --> 00:01:16,420
in the UB your would we do is

22
00:01:16,420 --> 00:01:19,690
that evicted try at least to get the
moved

23
00:01:19,690 --> 00:01:24,950
the network to get the best performance
of the network and that's use it will be

24
00:01:24,950 --> 00:01:25,320
a

25
00:01:25,320 --> 00:01:29,090
so to be honest I'm from the operative
site

26
00:01:29,090 --> 00:01:34,310
I'm from able to muster and

27
00:01:34,310 --> 00:01:37,500
I've got the owner to to be the very

28
00:01:37,500 --> 00:01:40,520
lasted the stadium to be the very last
these

29
00:01:40,520 --> 00:01:43,649
and two days let's see

30
00:01:43,650 --> 00:01:47,780
and yet it

31
00:01:47,780 --> 00:01:51,070
yeah it's not the last maybe this is
some sort of

32
00:01:51,070 --> 00:01:54,640
beginning of the future yeah Ltee long
term evolution

33
00:01:54,640 --> 00:01:59,100
he's something that's going to be
interesting for operators right now

34
00:01:59,100 --> 00:02:02,970
so that he stole so the Chisholm stories

35
00:02:02,970 --> 00:02:06,190
his smallest gone I was eight years old

36
00:02:06,190 --> 00:02:10,449
from operate decide the G-seven he's
some

37
00:02:10,449 --> 00:02:15,459
treated as getting the money from from
his

38
00:02:15,460 --> 00:02:18,990
perspective it was very interesting to
see for me the

39
00:02:18,990 --> 00:02:22,880
these first to will be before I was

40
00:02:22,880 --> 00:02:27,579
today the still there's some your
interest in investigations on

41
00:02:27,580 --> 00:02:32,020
and I fully agree use the these should

42
00:02:32,020 --> 00:02:35,730
the should be an ongoing process
institution

43
00:02:35,730 --> 00:02:41,390
should be continued because they are
forced to assume security legs and it

44
00:02:41,390 --> 00:02:42,390
should be sold

45
00:02:42,390 --> 00:02:46,410
and I was very

46
00:02:46,410 --> 00:02:50,299
was really very surprised

47
00:02:50,300 --> 00:02:53,870
I see the signaling solely in threes
already too good

48
00:02:53,870 --> 00:02:58,659
on the industries that would feel dizzy
from the commercial tools that see

49
00:02:58,659 --> 00:03:02,359
from commissions I'm just loading

50
00:03:02,360 --> 00:03:05,720
one more wild with I flew into DC

51
00:03:05,720 --> 00:03:09,519
the it is possible to to trace anyone

52
00:03:09,519 --> 00:03:13,400
and it's going to be very interesting
and you keep on doing that

53
00:03:13,400 --> 00:03:17,220
see in lindsey's I'm

54
00:03:17,220 --> 00:03:22,650
yah yeah in Review junior yeah I'm very
interested and

55
00:03:22,650 --> 00:03:26,230
me tonight gonna the one part of the
stories

56
00:03:26,230 --> 00:03:29,420
tight okie

57
00:03:29,420 --> 00:03:33,569
that's gonna be mine my introduction
yeah I M

58
00:03:33,569 --> 00:03:36,739
in the in the field of reorganization

59
00:03:36,739 --> 00:03:40,239
I'm dealing recently in three and

60
00:03:40,239 --> 00:03:43,329
so this is 2g and the main

61
00:03:43,329 --> 00:03:47,280
interest is 2g went i'm looking and

62
00:03:47,280 --> 00:03:51,230
your I'm one few interviews that he
wanted was to

63
00:03:51,230 --> 00:03:54,500
for the future for this is the story
that's gonna be

64
00:03:54,500 --> 00:03:59,060
with I don't want to present to you and

65
00:03:59,060 --> 00:04:02,730
year those visibility you review
interface

66
00:04:02,730 --> 00:04:06,379
Indian security missions since I'm not
the security

67
00:04:06,379 --> 00:04:09,629
expert yet and tried to

68
00:04:09,629 --> 00:04:12,730
get some somehow deep in that subject
but

69
00:04:12,730 --> 00:04:15,790
I'm not to exclude gifted

70
00:04:15,790 --> 00:04:19,029
and wall the reviews good so

71
00:04:19,030 --> 00:04:24,030
the we will go to the good through the
content anyway here so it's more as the

72
00:04:24,030 --> 00:04:24,640
basics

73
00:04:24,640 --> 00:04:27,750
it's not the the also that the

74
00:04:27,750 --> 00:04:30,750
seems ideal and

75
00:04:30,750 --> 00:04:33,890
let me T some comparison

76
00:04:33,890 --> 00:04:37,210
of the 2g 3G unity network

77
00:04:37,210 --> 00:04:41,229
in the pic it to me years or so good to
me it seems to be something different

78
00:04:41,230 --> 00:04:44,240
as the LTTE's pic

79
00:04:44,240 --> 00:04:48,290
only yeah from the beginning picket only
and

80
00:04:48,290 --> 00:04:51,900
we just can't compete yet the

81
00:04:51,900 --> 00:04:56,500
2g 3G and a team that pic it to me
basically from the beginning

82
00:04:56,500 --> 00:05:00,120
and fifty friend yeah

83
00:05:00,120 --> 00:05:05,520
name means for the the beaches or the
base transceiver station in

84
00:05:05,520 --> 00:05:08,639
3G call did not be anonymity

85
00:05:08,639 --> 00:05:12,289
season some home you bored word

86
00:05:12,289 --> 00:05:15,590
unit was systems called involved

87
00:05:15,590 --> 00:05:19,669
we've got some some controlling station
known the

88
00:05:19,669 --> 00:05:22,710
2g side is good some polling station on

89
00:05:22,710 --> 00:05:28,229
3G side and that is a hopefully an
advantage you haven't got that for the

90
00:05:28,229 --> 00:05:31,270
duties ideas or the controlling station

91
00:05:31,270 --> 00:05:35,500
is somehow moves to the note the world
in C

92
00:05:35,500 --> 00:05:40,300
even to those who need and

93
00:05:40,300 --> 00:05:43,919
yet some some this gives us some

94
00:05:43,919 --> 00:05:48,190
advantages in za you know this RNC in
the UC

95
00:05:48,190 --> 00:05:51,490
the need to do some something

96
00:05:51,490 --> 00:05:55,580
cause time and we need to lose be a
sometimes

97
00:05:55,580 --> 00:05:59,240
you want to to get more through would
you want to be more reactive

98
00:05:59,240 --> 00:06:03,490
and we need to save some and

99
00:06:03,490 --> 00:06:08,449
for the 2g and 3G we've got there soon G
purists node is called

100
00:06:08,449 --> 00:06:12,000
is to use and after that it was good all
maybe

101
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:15,370
several of them yet to come the traffic
in the network

102
00:06:15,370 --> 00:06:19,750
and got the gate to be GPRS with no food
or linseed

103
00:06:19,750 --> 00:06:23,860
GG is in just engage meet within

104
00:06:23,860 --> 00:06:27,569
worldwide and we've got something
similar

105
00:06:27,569 --> 00:06:31,080
mean duties all nothing unit C but

106
00:06:31,080 --> 00:06:34,080
turn bill definitely the

107
00:06:34,080 --> 00:06:37,710
do compared to lose 3G it's really

108
00:06:37,710 --> 00:06:42,009
somehow different the because the the
cornered

109
00:06:42,009 --> 00:06:45,639
will to distinguish

110
00:06:45,639 --> 00:06:49,030
the LTTE he's the

111
00:06:49,030 --> 00:06:52,190
is in reality the said

112
00:06:52,190 --> 00:06:56,900
RF Lizzie so it's are and it's not the
corner to occur

113
00:06:56,900 --> 00:06:59,979
so the long term evolution is in fact

114
00:06:59,979 --> 00:07:03,128
only these the review hot

115
00:07:03,129 --> 00:07:07,509
and these you most picket column

116
00:07:07,509 --> 00:07:11,270
the he's scored his core elements in

117
00:07:11,270 --> 00:07:14,770
and the core elements in consists of you
put your real

118
00:07:14,770 --> 00:07:18,469
know we're so some Realty management MTG
year

119
00:07:18,470 --> 00:07:21,560
to get to the Hindu were up and running

120
00:07:21,560 --> 00:07:25,819
wanted to see you someone United mood

121
00:07:25,819 --> 00:07:29,789
get some years old is the connection to
these

122
00:07:29,789 --> 00:07:33,628
no be's through through some

123
00:07:33,629 --> 00:07:36,770
this morning to face in this one
interface can be

124
00:07:36,770 --> 00:07:41,840
distinguish between Julia its on the one
hand it will be the management

125
00:07:41,840 --> 00:07:45,830
and on the one hand is a user-driven
year and the use in traffic

126
00:07:45,830 --> 00:07:49,849
coastal deservingly so this is the seven
deadly

127
00:07:49,849 --> 00:07:52,860
this and connection between those two

128
00:07:52,860 --> 00:07:56,120
diminishment you must have been good in
school that is

129
00:07:56,120 --> 00:07:59,370
11 interface this some

130
00:07:59,370 --> 00:08:03,199
so would like to and

131
00:08:03,199 --> 00:08:07,449
be alarmed the region on in the GSM

132
00:08:07,449 --> 00:08:12,330
3G world endurance called the home
subscriber soon

133
00:08:12,330 --> 00:08:14,909
weird

134
00:08:14,910 --> 00:08:18,540
yeah the college apps who is the keys
may use the word

135
00:08:18,540 --> 00:08:22,710
and from this

136
00:08:22,710 --> 00:08:26,230
seven-page me this pipe into Phase go to
these

137
00:08:26,230 --> 00:08:31,300
public data network key to be here in
them through that

138
00:08:31,300 --> 00:08:37,030
to the end very interesting he's the
them

139
00:08:37,030 --> 00:08:40,569
you've got the direct connection from

140
00:08:40,570 --> 00:08:44,890
he not been to the other be that could
be relieved I did

141
00:08:44,890 --> 00:08:49,630
but in most cases it's gonna be a.m.
usually two faces

142
00:08:49,630 --> 00:08:53,560
who's not mi vida direct line

143
00:08:53,560 --> 00:08:55,870
good real connection

144
00:08:55,870 --> 00:09:00,550
is vigilant to freeze so the not be

145
00:09:00,550 --> 00:09:04,099
in pretty mines gonna be connected to
the movie management

146
00:09:04,100 --> 00:09:07,380
to deal with the Civic HB yeah lewis won

147
00:09:07,380 --> 00:09:10,920
both over this which

148
00:09:10,920 --> 00:09:13,920
which the seventy degrees more results
on

149
00:09:13,920 --> 00:09:17,449
and through this wrote two functions

150
00:09:17,450 --> 00:09:21,900
to engage the there's gonna be some you
need to change

151
00:09:21,900 --> 00:09:27,120
busy the next to a diff is gonna be
through these

152
00:09:27,120 --> 00:09:30,730
doing good but generally speaking a word

153
00:09:30,730 --> 00:09:37,730
be good of the 62 news

154
00:09:39,019 --> 00:09:42,480
their requirements from him

155
00:09:42,480 --> 00:09:45,939
you know from the next generation is it
look like that

156
00:09:45,939 --> 00:09:49,360
so it's gonna be eternity the services
convened

157
00:09:49,360 --> 00:09:53,149
this should be some sort of 220 him

158
00:09:53,149 --> 00:09:57,509
but it's basically then lead even see
what's going to happen but it could be

159
00:09:57,509 --> 00:09:58,689
was work

160
00:09:58,689 --> 00:10:02,099
be some some old-fashioned
circuit-switched

161
00:10:02,100 --> 00:10:05,379
is built the

162
00:10:05,379 --> 00:10:09,689
this mobility yeah and maybe this

163
00:10:09,689 --> 00:10:13,060
that's a big difference between

164
00:10:13,060 --> 00:10:16,699
or other systems scenes or other systems

165
00:10:16,699 --> 00:10:20,079
your haven't got the in the specs

166
00:10:20,079 --> 00:10:24,100
the movie two years with these this wifi

167
00:10:24,100 --> 00:10:27,600
with his this some sort of movie teams
idea

168
00:10:27,600 --> 00:10:31,000
but them the city requires a

169
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:38,000
up to 250 kilometres even more this is a
broadcast the fines de eso

170
00:10:38,160 --> 00:10:41,759
you could run some delusional

171
00:10:41,759 --> 00:10:45,290
schism worried you broadcast could be

172
00:10:45,290 --> 00:10:48,449
to be Louisville but

173
00:10:48,449 --> 00:10:52,470
I have storm dumps that this will never
happen seems the

174
00:10:52,470 --> 00:10:55,559
Hartley's too expensive to prove
provides

175
00:10:55,559 --> 00:10:59,160
rooms and data rates

176
00:10:59,160 --> 00:11:03,649
current status is because its high data
rate Syed

177
00:11:03,649 --> 00:11:07,250
what's gonna be happen in the future I
didn't know you could hide eateries

178
00:11:07,250 --> 00:11:10,740
means currently no with the interface up
to 100 megabits

179
00:11:10,740 --> 00:11:14,910
and only maybe up to 300 megabits

180
00:11:14,910 --> 00:11:18,100
in the future depends on the structures
them

181
00:11:18,100 --> 00:11:21,360
incident and %um

182
00:11:21,360 --> 00:11:25,750
up leading up to 50 megabit per second I
mean the CID

183
00:11:25,750 --> 00:11:30,470
been i've seen that first in my life
that I wasn't driving car I've got the

184
00:11:30,470 --> 00:11:32,279
laptop b-side media

185
00:11:32,279 --> 00:11:35,339
in I've got did fifty megabytes

186
00:11:35,339 --> 00:11:38,620
I with a normal mode in like an USB
stick

187
00:11:38,620 --> 00:11:42,470
enough for 250 megabytes driving car in

188
00:11:42,470 --> 00:11:45,649
I saw who would that's gonna be Union

189
00:11:45,649 --> 00:11:49,209
area it's gonna be I'm part of the
future

190
00:11:49,209 --> 00:11:52,290
the it wasn't really a you see reviews
yet

191
00:11:52,290 --> 00:11:56,380
I could see fifty megabytes seconds
sorry

192
00:11:56,380 --> 00:12:00,259
megabits per second and that

193
00:12:00,259 --> 00:12:03,839
did I thought the eighty you on the
future

194
00:12:03,839 --> 00:12:08,300
you know and what you're talking now is
not the future is really yeah

195
00:12:08,300 --> 00:12:11,319
so that happens right now and

196
00:12:11,319 --> 00:12:14,870
I mean system into to deploy that up
there so

197
00:12:14,870 --> 00:12:18,220
in some areas will still is Indian is
already looking

198
00:12:18,220 --> 00:12:21,250
I mean you've got the SIM cards give the
motives but the

199
00:12:21,250 --> 00:12:24,399
he's already state-of-the-art on

200
00:12:24,399 --> 00:12:28,389
and it could be that as it may be to you
see four years in

201
00:12:28,389 --> 00:12:32,720
and no one cares about these 2g with 3G
because

202
00:12:32,720 --> 00:12:36,699
good used to 102 make a vid

203
00:12:36,699 --> 00:12:40,269
I don't know what happens but it's a

204
00:12:40,269 --> 00:12:43,509
it's very interesting subject and

205
00:12:43,509 --> 00:12:47,120
you know what these review jimmy is did
the giant

206
00:12:47,120 --> 00:12:50,269
to increases inspections spectral
efficiency

207
00:12:50,269 --> 00:12:53,790
this is very interesting and would lead
them

208
00:12:53,790 --> 00:12:56,920
he's a yeah %uh the they said yes

209
00:12:56,920 --> 00:13:00,089
this three cheese despite busy many
structures

210
00:13:00,089 --> 00:13:04,699
not the division so we could go somehow

211
00:13:04,699 --> 00:13:08,079
one step further and use a different
solution scheme and it's gonna be a

212
00:13:08,079 --> 00:13:12,559
took too good and

213
00:13:12,559 --> 00:13:15,790
yet and these the engine is thought
okays

214
00:13:15,790 --> 00:13:20,000
circuits which teaches also can switch
connections

215
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:23,029
undersold vision let's use the pic it
serves only

216
00:13:23,029 --> 00:13:26,370
and for this they need some maybe

217
00:13:26,370 --> 00:13:29,670
you something agency less than music
concert with the

218
00:13:29,670 --> 00:13:32,870
find the the consultation latency

219
00:13:32,870 --> 00:13:36,579
less than 100 musicSkins and thats this
now

220
00:13:36,579 --> 00:13:40,449
really yet pizza really incredibly OB

221
00:13:40,449 --> 00:13:43,449
to reach is run and his computer

222
00:13:43,449 --> 00:13:47,589
to fix that in some some stages so

223
00:13:47,589 --> 00:13:51,230
internally you know company in there
were some

224
00:13:51,230 --> 00:13:55,350
some salsa maybe if hundreds of users
use

225
00:13:55,350 --> 00:14:00,689
on sale and they agreed on whose behalf
with 50 megabit per second so

226
00:14:00,689 --> 00:14:04,040
it what's going to happen with the fixed
lines in because

227
00:14:04,040 --> 00:14:07,860
the traffic on the interface has to be
some whole covered by the fixed lines

228
00:14:07,860 --> 00:14:08,839
derived from the

229
00:14:08,839 --> 00:14:12,319
you know be done to them some switching
gentleman's

230
00:14:12,319 --> 00:14:16,870
and full in what I've seen so far is
that

231
00:14:16,870 --> 00:14:19,929
even the the hotties your the

232
00:14:19,929 --> 00:14:23,419
some home the means to provide the
stated

233
00:14:23,419 --> 00:14:27,809
so very interesting even you need to get
that the date on the Netopia

234
00:14:27,809 --> 00:14:30,919
selective some in two phases and USB
interfaces

235
00:14:30,919 --> 00:14:34,809
even not able to to carry that I think
you're so in the head

236
00:14:34,809 --> 00:14:37,919
really to be honest we had to select the
USB

237
00:14:37,919 --> 00:14:41,750
point because not all use people's

238
00:14:41,750 --> 00:14:46,419
are looking for that speed absolute some
she has USB ports leadership is

239
00:14:46,419 --> 00:14:50,240
some storages like that they are not
capable

240
00:14:50,240 --> 00:14:54,149
for providing that's been zoned

241
00:14:54,149 --> 00:14:57,500
was a very interesting thing that the
radio

242
00:14:57,500 --> 00:15:01,209
the review is that strong right now on
did

243
00:15:01,209 --> 00:15:05,339
that yet the fixed-line see that hadn't
gotten even hardly

244
00:15:05,339 --> 00:15:09,329
the the need to see some different some

245
00:15:09,329 --> 00:15:14,329
very interesting souls good am

246
00:15:14,329 --> 00:15:18,730
yet on the physically in I mentioned
already the need to have some

247
00:15:18,730 --> 00:15:22,209
different sort of pollution and

248
00:15:22,209 --> 00:15:25,509
generally in Cincy pre-printed so

249
00:15:25,509 --> 00:15:30,009
Lord happens on frequency its somehow
compare abuses

250
00:15:30,009 --> 00:15:33,199
3G story so 3G use one

251
00:15:33,199 --> 00:15:37,289
frequency or urgency one frequency band
and

252
00:15:37,289 --> 00:15:40,970
here we've got some receive treatment in
its good school

253
00:15:40,970 --> 00:15:45,389
Donley uses 10 frequency division
multiple access

254
00:15:45,389 --> 00:15:48,809
media be provide some

255
00:15:48,809 --> 00:15:52,889
some to the up lead to something similar
know so the process systems

256
00:15:52,889 --> 00:15:57,189
he's doing something similar it's easy
to carry frequency

257
00:15:57,189 --> 00:16:00,679
jewish multiplexes you can look good

258
00:16:00,679 --> 00:16:05,350
in Google find these seems a very
interesting relation

259
00:16:05,350 --> 00:16:08,630
and use already these with a frequency
division

260
00:16:08,630 --> 00:16:12,569
lives is all these the digital TV

261
00:16:12,569 --> 00:16:16,100
these days and device

262
00:16:16,100 --> 00:16:20,329
using the children so it's nothing you
and even the chips it's already the

263
00:16:20,329 --> 00:16:20,839
rupiah

264
00:16:20,839 --> 00:16:24,120
maybe not for the freemen's you use it
for for these

265
00:16:24,120 --> 00:16:27,490
guilty but for some different
frequencies in the first

266
00:16:27,490 --> 00:16:30,980
to pins its hopes on

267
00:16:30,980 --> 00:16:34,549
delivered be years with the mobilization
have repeatedly

268
00:16:34,549 --> 00:16:37,880
the containers that already existing

269
00:16:37,880 --> 00:16:41,160
them you know what fine does so the Jews

270
00:16:41,160 --> 00:16:45,929
are already a the just be brought into a
smaller size

271
00:16:45,929 --> 00:16:51,079
mi vida energy consumption BB the
frequencies

272
00:16:51,079 --> 00:16:55,639
very interesting thing is that also all
was all the same frequency

273
00:16:55,639 --> 00:16:58,769
yeah more than eight weeks one frequency

274
00:16:58,769 --> 00:17:02,419
the the bench with the skill so

275
00:17:02,419 --> 00:17:07,059
that's going to be very interesting for
the operator so the club starts with me

276
00:17:07,059 --> 00:17:10,939
GSM 900 with maybe 1.4 megabits in

277
00:17:10,939 --> 00:17:16,309
and provide still also switches and if
the if they've got to know

278
00:17:16,309 --> 00:17:19,470
been visited the context in 23

279
00:17:19,470 --> 00:17:24,260
to five to ten to twenty minutes so
would

280
00:17:24,260 --> 00:17:27,819
currently state diseases right now all

281
00:17:27,819 --> 00:17:31,500
speed which are provided in the the wood

282
00:17:31,500 --> 00:17:35,090
regarding your TV images usually 20
megan's you can't

283
00:17:35,090 --> 00:17:39,340
see list and Max

284
00:17:39,340 --> 00:17:44,309
im yet new antenna signal technologies
all mine will be a

285
00:17:44,309 --> 00:17:47,980
with two billion with growth would and
is a

286
00:17:47,980 --> 00:17:51,399
up different in on systems leon your

287
00:17:51,399 --> 00:17:54,870
to yes maybe not but my movies a

288
00:17:54,870 --> 00:18:00,010
yet is common shares a wall Lisa new
vision and he moves to use my mood

289
00:18:00,010 --> 00:18:03,480
so difficult to receiving and you to
read

290
00:18:03,480 --> 00:18:07,280
transmitting something inside and

291
00:18:07,280 --> 00:18:13,090
that's a state of the art and infect you
re you could doubled and tripled

292
00:18:13,090 --> 00:18:17,050
you but thats see you

293
00:18:17,050 --> 00:18:20,720
but he went home series it's a good
approach with two

294
00:18:20,720 --> 00:18:24,780
to improved him but to take

295
00:18:24,780 --> 00:18:28,480
with the technicians thought is a
they've got them

296
00:18:28,480 --> 00:18:31,990
she said they've got the 3G yeah

297
00:18:31,990 --> 00:18:35,510
and and 3G squint

298
00:18:35,510 --> 00:18:39,250
brings to be honest it's too complex
from the

299
00:18:39,250 --> 00:18:42,419
operate decided I mean from operated

300
00:18:42,419 --> 00:18:45,860
need sides to conferences the so

301
00:18:45,860 --> 00:18:48,960
these them hola regulation all the time

302
00:18:48,960 --> 00:18:53,290
and it's really very convincing and

303
00:18:53,290 --> 00:18:57,070
did at the end and he's not dead

304
00:18:57,070 --> 00:19:00,928
conferences the really tried to reduce
the complexity of

305
00:19:00,929 --> 00:19:04,250
systems there's no you see you or even
RNC

306
00:19:04,250 --> 00:19:08,129
you know they're on really need to
control

307
00:19:08,129 --> 00:19:11,379
and this helps him but he really needs
to be some

308
00:19:11,379 --> 00:19:15,330
all in your head but these controlling
his

309
00:19:15,330 --> 00:19:19,530
moved into these more intelligent
whoopi's

310
00:19:19,530 --> 00:19:22,980
them in there's no soviet Assault in New

311
00:19:22,980 --> 00:19:26,080
saliste was he and

312
00:19:26,080 --> 00:19:30,918
someone mentioned during 3G time but
that doesn't

313
00:19:30,919 --> 00:19:34,250
this this protocol overhead

314
00:19:34,250 --> 00:19:38,550
and someone sells organizing took years
and my colleagues and some

315
00:19:38,550 --> 00:19:41,790
YouTube because will what you're doing
is

316
00:19:41,790 --> 00:19:45,049
optimize the network you find out the
best in the world religions

317
00:19:45,049 --> 00:19:48,720
on the this thresholds for certain
situations

318
00:19:48,720 --> 00:19:51,960
in if the need to instill organizing
units to you

319
00:19:51,960 --> 00:19:55,260
itself is who it could be. the

320
00:19:55,260 --> 00:20:00,350
me fuse I'm I have to do something
different

321
00:20:00,350 --> 00:20:04,740
to you see what happens in and one
important he said

322
00:20:04,740 --> 00:20:08,799
the management the mobility management
entity

323
00:20:08,799 --> 00:20:15,799
use connect do the be and doing the
symbol next to stop them signaling

324
00:20:16,510 --> 00:20:19,860
what does it mean in this is the bureau
management so

325
00:20:19,860 --> 00:20:23,100
from the very first beginning every
customer gets a default

326
00:20:23,100 --> 00:20:27,490
%um miss some quality of service control
inside you

327
00:20:27,490 --> 00:20:31,970
this the the PG procedure insight into
the united states and mobility

328
00:20:31,970 --> 00:20:33,450
management in

329
00:20:33,450 --> 00:20:36,950
and the user tracking is inside them

330
00:20:36,950 --> 00:20:41,490
so you the user taking some home just a
different name user

331
00:20:41,490 --> 00:20:45,820
%um 2g and 3G good dislocation period

332
00:20:45,820 --> 00:20:49,010
and no ltée it's a different names
drinking

333
00:20:49,010 --> 00:20:52,520
area but could be roughly the same

334
00:20:52,520 --> 00:20:56,549
there's some signaling

335
00:20:56,549 --> 00:21:00,679
yeah and the signaling yet may be
connected

336
00:21:00,679 --> 00:21:04,750
to other the diminishment in 2d
signaling to the home subscribers who

337
00:21:04,750 --> 00:21:05,580
was signaling

338
00:21:05,580 --> 00:21:10,960
to the so indeed and soon to be
reasonably easy to the old

339
00:21:10,960 --> 00:21:15,470
system cases doing do G 3G

340
00:21:15,470 --> 00:21:18,649
the security management is good and

341
00:21:18,649 --> 00:21:23,760
the reason I sold him if he would be a
good starting point for that

342
00:21:23,760 --> 00:21:28,460
to mention use authentication and
ciphering integrity predictions

343
00:21:28,460 --> 00:21:33,980
idea that's going to be done by then

344
00:21:33,980 --> 00:21:38,840
yet let's go back to these spectrum

345
00:21:38,840 --> 00:21:42,090
a its call

346
00:21:42,090 --> 00:21:45,970
what we know frequency division multiple
access I don't know

347
00:21:45,970 --> 00:21:49,580
I don't maybe you see that so these

348
00:21:49,580 --> 00:21:52,949
gonna be a different color these

349
00:21:52,950 --> 00:21:56,109
zeros every general

350
00:21:56,109 --> 00:21:59,158
a row should be one carrier frequency

351
00:21:59,159 --> 00:22:02,629
so using wat want to know frequencies

352
00:22:02,629 --> 00:22:05,970
in this PC may be over 50 Louis

353
00:22:05,970 --> 00:22:10,080
and ever use against me movement

354
00:22:10,080 --> 00:22:13,449
so and it can be done and to change to

355
00:22:13,450 --> 00:22:17,690
you can can change every five yeah 500
music

356
00:22:17,690 --> 00:22:21,770
the bins with you served yet could be

357
00:22:21,770 --> 00:22:25,109
modified by the operator so it's from

358
00:22:25,109 --> 00:22:28,600
booked for 220 millions so we've got
some

359
00:22:28,600 --> 00:22:32,169
the world of clinton's up gone to bed

360
00:22:32,169 --> 00:22:35,770
did because the next over its gonna be
starting here deal

361
00:22:35,770 --> 00:22:40,059
Cup so there needs to be some goblins

362
00:22:40,059 --> 00:22:43,320
the diffuse from the gym and

363
00:22:43,320 --> 00:22:47,030
their pi don't see a inside the hole
bends with

364
00:22:47,030 --> 00:22:51,750
there's some pilots the pilot is too
good

365
00:22:51,750 --> 00:22:56,200
figure out the the propagation

366
00:22:56,200 --> 00:22:59,299
so if someone knows the propagation

367
00:22:59,299 --> 00:23:03,940
use you can you can easily concluded is
due

368
00:23:03,940 --> 00:23:07,399
students and that's gonna be done

369
00:23:07,399 --> 00:23:13,740
knows Pines even in geez and you've got
the pieces each was transmitting added

370
00:23:13,740 --> 00:23:16,750
times series transmitting always be with
pose

371
00:23:16,750 --> 00:23:21,169
so you have some sort of reference and
is gonna be bored

372
00:23:21,169 --> 00:23:25,470
some sold its there's gonna be some

373
00:23:25,470 --> 00:23:29,840
DC subcarrier in the middle yeah

374
00:23:29,840 --> 00:23:35,230
this nothing is transmitted so this is
gonna be

375
00:23:35,230 --> 00:23:39,240
sons them

376
00:23:39,240 --> 00:23:42,520
if you see that on the proven sixes and
on the time

377
00:23:42,520 --> 00:23:46,609
nixon you see the the user's good

378
00:23:46,609 --> 00:23:49,899
definitely Reese was blocks spokes

379
00:23:49,899 --> 00:23:53,500
which drove drones was procured

380
00:23:53,500 --> 00:23:56,559
which consists of 12 so curious in

381
00:23:56,559 --> 00:24:00,770
them heavy at least 180 clinton

382
00:24:00,770 --> 00:24:04,168
and one one of these spokes his gums

383
00:24:04,169 --> 00:24:08,159
7 symbols inside your and the duration
-ism

384
00:24:08,159 --> 00:24:13,179
of solid you have a music

385
00:24:13,179 --> 00:24:17,270
and use goddess up got pinned

386
00:24:17,270 --> 00:24:21,220
God and izvestiya

387
00:24:21,220 --> 00:24:26,440
and the the user this your new user

388
00:24:26,440 --> 00:24:29,859
is known him for

389
00:24:29,859 --> 00:24:33,149
one millisecond these two blocks in

390
00:24:33,149 --> 00:24:36,270
and another pop music in these two
broads and then

391
00:24:36,270 --> 00:24:40,869
for some reason it gets maurice was born

392
00:24:40,869 --> 00:24:45,109
so the republicans would at least every
millisecond

393
00:24:45,109 --> 00:24:48,240
the user can get Morse's box

394
00:24:48,240 --> 00:24:52,600
and evened you if the user's do you
handle your

395
00:24:52,600 --> 00:24:56,669
because it is the freemen's network if
the user's do you handle with another

396
00:24:56,669 --> 00:24:59,679
sell via you push will be good

397
00:24:59,679 --> 00:25:02,780
in other owners whose book which means

398
00:25:02,780 --> 00:25:07,210
Eugene's you can somehow another
frequency

399
00:25:07,210 --> 00:25:11,609
and compared to jesus said some awesome

400
00:25:11,609 --> 00:25:17,369
so we've got some some frequency Lindsay
this is one cheese and general dissident

401
00:25:17,369 --> 00:25:19,490
another geez in general

402
00:25:19,490 --> 00:25:22,559
the movement's using 2 G's engines in

403
00:25:22,559 --> 00:25:26,010
and but could be

404
00:25:26,010 --> 00:25:29,549
could use more yeah even if the quality
is there was an awesome

405
00:25:29,549 --> 00:25:33,540
could use all those books or if the $20
million

406
00:25:33,540 --> 00:25:39,280
so instead he's just a middle of the
quality of service it was a good

407
00:25:39,280 --> 00:25:42,619
and if he's indicted mood he could use
nothing

408
00:25:42,619 --> 00:25:45,690
in this is very dynamically even in hong

409
00:25:45,690 --> 00:25:51,200
one musicians that could change

410
00:25:51,200 --> 00:25:54,799
so and compared to the 3G yielded

411
00:25:54,799 --> 00:25:58,549
3G uses the haldeman with all the time

412
00:25:58,549 --> 00:26:01,869
and every user is on top of that biz

413
00:26:01,869 --> 00:26:06,010
uses the same and with all the time
you've got here

414
00:26:06,010 --> 00:26:10,500
the uses these two distinguished by the
frequencies

415
00:26:10,500 --> 00:26:14,149
and so it's a somehow

416
00:26:14,149 --> 00:26:18,040
good mixture between the 3G and the 2g
and

417
00:26:18,040 --> 00:26:21,158
very interesting system and

418
00:26:21,159 --> 00:26:25,799
yes seems too good

419
00:26:25,799 --> 00:26:29,730
and regarding the use a plea latency

420
00:26:29,730 --> 00:26:33,049
him yet these are just some some

421
00:26:33,049 --> 00:26:36,168
because you know they are not do it for
sure exactly a

422
00:26:36,169 --> 00:26:39,859
you too dangerous so we get rid need
some home

423
00:26:39,859 --> 00:26:44,100
some processing its need some hole

424
00:26:44,100 --> 00:26:47,470
%um Trillium on this one interface to
the new

425
00:26:47,470 --> 00:26:50,639
be in the known be some processing your

426
00:26:50,639 --> 00:26:54,769
at least youth group some

427
00:26:54,769 --> 00:26:58,580
some latency from from all around

428
00:26:58,580 --> 00:27:02,120
fight music insipid that's gonna be

429
00:27:02,120 --> 00:27:05,200
happened this

430
00:27:05,200 --> 00:27:09,380
some yeah

431
00:27:09,380 --> 00:27:12,700
the pic in the inside the implication if
if you consider

432
00:27:12,700 --> 00:27:17,159
upper leaves them that could be some
implication

433
00:27:17,159 --> 00:27:20,769
to

434
00:27:20,769 --> 00:27:24,740
yet some process to figure out some
disturbed

435
00:27:24,740 --> 00:27:30,990
pickens missus

436
00:27:30,990 --> 00:27:34,770
him yeah the contemplated latency
compared to 3G

437
00:27:34,770 --> 00:27:39,280
yeah on 3G you've got several states and
it's not that complicated no

438
00:27:39,280 --> 00:27:42,960
dirty you could just two states in

439
00:27:42,960 --> 00:27:46,920
even I did this to be used as a assisted

440
00:27:46,920 --> 00:27:50,110
disconnected as usual but

441
00:27:50,110 --> 00:27:53,090
yet is good

442
00:27:53,090 --> 00:27:56,750
good these doing some

443
00:27:56,750 --> 00:28:00,179
and

444
00:28:00,179 --> 00:28:03,480
yet this transition is very fast

445
00:28:03,480 --> 00:28:07,950
no sorry there's something wrong who
just completed

446
00:28:07,950 --> 00:28:11,670
so it's 30 a.m. its

447
00:28:11,670 --> 00:28:15,010
ROCE connected and is not registered

448
00:28:15,010 --> 00:28:18,650
is committed to doing some things since
datum

449
00:28:18,650 --> 00:28:21,840
and yet

450
00:28:21,840 --> 00:28:25,600
did this is much more faster than

451
00:28:25,600 --> 00:28:29,290
good right now him 3G you need to read

452
00:28:29,290 --> 00:28:33,049
at least half a second roughly a theater

453
00:28:33,049 --> 00:28:36,418
come in through through the pipe

454
00:28:36,419 --> 00:28:40,320
to your work this quite long story

455
00:28:40,320 --> 00:28:46,320
at least the deboers the Kenyan always
complain about that but my colleagues to

456
00:28:46,320 --> 00:28:47,770
beans

457
00:28:47,770 --> 00:28:51,510
to me there's some

458
00:28:51,510 --> 00:28:54,600
I decided the LTTE

459
00:28:54,600 --> 00:29:01,600
yeah in the network you've got the
subpoena mean it. so nothing

460
00:29:01,799 --> 00:29:04,820
changers that's already exists so

461
00:29:04,820 --> 00:29:09,379
what's going to be uses your stupid
service bureau diesel the awesome

462
00:29:09,380 --> 00:29:13,130
bureau your you know organism txt
fearsome

463
00:29:13,130 --> 00:29:17,250
background beautiful 100 so in the or
get somebody

464
00:29:17,250 --> 00:29:21,850
you've got to admit to it I did entities
I mean there's nothing you

465
00:29:21,850 --> 00:29:25,679
you know already that his exit GOP 10

466
00:29:25,679 --> 00:29:30,090
Teresa Wallace this subject ID

467
00:29:30,090 --> 00:29:34,960
which consists all in former times
location area

468
00:29:34,960 --> 00:29:38,660
and the mine you know the most
well-known

469
00:29:38,660 --> 00:29:41,970
the school mine is yeah some sort

470
00:29:41,970 --> 00:29:45,590
emergency MCC

471
00:29:45,590 --> 00:29:51,169
me im yeah I'm nothing to do yet

472
00:29:51,169 --> 00:29:54,490
you did imposed from

473
00:29:54,490 --> 00:30:01,490
what is new year this some sort of been
the milieu

474
00:30:01,650 --> 00:30:05,270
hearing for peace and or

475
00:30:05,270 --> 00:30:11,080
the scenes me beyond all did you the use
the treatment

476
00:30:11,080 --> 00:30:14,620
the musée will know this

477
00:30:14,620 --> 00:30:18,190
to see TM

478
00:30:18,190 --> 00:30:21,230
design the mind

479
00:30:21,230 --> 00:30:28,230
and he's guilty this key scene in the
city

480
00:30:30,070 --> 00:30:34,309
him but it's a some homes

481
00:30:34,309 --> 00:30:37,870
similar to the 3G story and

482
00:30:37,870 --> 00:30:40,919
the maybe the these jimmy is

483
00:30:40,919 --> 00:30:44,070
thought to how could the improved the

484
00:30:44,070 --> 00:30:48,649
these this key story with deciphering
Windows and

485
00:30:48,650 --> 00:30:52,000
the meat you know suited for 3G

486
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:55,270
see this inside did

487
00:30:55,270 --> 00:30:58,470
you seem form

488
00:30:58,470 --> 00:31:03,140
what indication there's some some be

489
00:31:03,140 --> 00:31:06,720
some home walkies

490
00:31:06,720 --> 00:31:10,630
site from that there

491
00:31:10,630 --> 00:31:14,309
derived his Shiki ninety and

492
00:31:14,309 --> 00:31:17,450
you seems the disease somehow

493
00:31:17,450 --> 00:31:21,169
how to keep curriculum and

494
00:31:21,169 --> 00:31:24,830
even yet for these them nice

495
00:31:24,830 --> 00:31:29,408
the non-existent some some keys which
could be generated

496
00:31:29,409 --> 00:31:33,630
there's some peacefully don't be for the
communication

497
00:31:33,630 --> 00:31:37,429
three tourists was controlled there's
some

498
00:31:37,429 --> 00:31:41,440
in good

499
00:31:41,440 --> 00:31:45,850
and and

500
00:31:45,850 --> 00:31:49,080
ninety but it seems big in your area so

501
00:31:49,080 --> 00:31:52,408
some correct yet so the theme good

502
00:31:52,409 --> 00:31:55,510
tool to implement walkies is going to be
more safe

503
00:31:55,510 --> 00:31:59,950
I have some thoughts about it could be
the just born

504
00:31:59,950 --> 00:32:02,980
process are you needed me beat Cincy no

505
00:32:02,980 --> 00:32:06,679
scenes this morning i know im

506
00:32:06,679 --> 00:32:11,140
nothing to see the purpose of the system

507
00:32:11,140 --> 00:32:15,030
key separation use a distinguish

508
00:32:15,030 --> 00:32:19,668
the user traffic from Seton so

509
00:32:19,669 --> 00:32:24,200
the keys the us toward a different
locations be not only in one location

510
00:32:24,200 --> 00:32:26,419
the install a different occasions that
could help

511
00:32:26,419 --> 00:32:29,419
anybody this and bring you will

512
00:32:29,419 --> 00:32:32,610
year the key could change on the fly
yeah

513
00:32:32,610 --> 00:32:38,130
this is gonna be implemented right now
space you've got some HOE

514
00:32:38,130 --> 00:32:41,250
some security which could be reviewed

515
00:32:41,250 --> 00:32:44,900
so the operator can decide did

516
00:32:44,900 --> 00:32:48,490
hi delivered the security UN to use

517
00:32:48,490 --> 00:32:51,800
the key generation we will not use it

518
00:32:51,800 --> 00:32:55,059
and the

519
00:32:55,059 --> 00:32:59,030
want to half the more independence the
reviewed

520
00:32:59,030 --> 00:33:03,090
these them currently this

521
00:33:03,090 --> 00:33:10,090
to mandatory sets of Security deserves
no 3G in the fuse

522
00:33:10,919 --> 00:33:15,120
100 and 97 and the

523
00:33:15,120 --> 00:33:18,350
at the mall was the waldheim's

524
00:33:18,350 --> 00:33:22,630
group supported luv you than me they
should support these

525
00:33:22,630 --> 00:33:26,820
Bulls sense of security I'm

526
00:33:26,820 --> 00:33:30,649
yet resumes the good

527
00:33:30,649 --> 00:33:35,530
negotiated separately between the union
the movie and

528
00:33:35,530 --> 00:33:38,918
even on the most liberal and

529
00:33:38,919 --> 00:33:42,730
the use security capabilities said
considered a procedure

530
00:33:42,730 --> 00:33:46,970
tourism and cannot be changed into

531
00:33:46,970 --> 00:33:50,010
the handover during handover

532
00:33:50,010 --> 00:33:53,600
could be some some

533
00:33:53,600 --> 00:33:58,070
change in the in secret even it's
already defined in the specs

534
00:33:58,070 --> 00:34:02,450
you could as gonna be happened in
reality that is over in the

535
00:34:02,450 --> 00:34:09,119
will decide to go for the this would be
increased

536
00:34:09,119 --> 00:34:12,119
porcelain LTTE's worth just how these

537
00:34:12,119 --> 00:34:15,800
pick a story right now for was allegedly

538
00:34:15,800 --> 00:34:19,330
a.m. this gonna be some discussions

539
00:34:19,330 --> 00:34:22,520
if home if

540
00:34:22,520 --> 00:34:26,109
the evening to have some circuit
switched for a pic

541
00:34:26,109 --> 00:34:29,600
so some cities which pipe which

542
00:34:29,600 --> 00:34:34,409
yeah is gonna be introduced at least the
think about that

543
00:34:34,409 --> 00:34:38,570
it personally I think this I miss

544
00:34:38,570 --> 00:34:42,220
would be the story for the future so
retrieving eagles wings

545
00:34:42,220 --> 00:34:45,460
missus is already deployed up there
mines

546
00:34:45,460 --> 00:34:48,820
companies and yet

547
00:34:48,820 --> 00:34:51,839
this I miss home some strange

548
00:34:51,839 --> 00:34:55,489
thing for me is really you Union and it
has

549
00:34:55,490 --> 00:34:59,460
socialism Lex security and

550
00:34:59,460 --> 00:35:03,570
its yeah it's not the isn't the best
ones

551
00:35:03,570 --> 00:35:06,630
even some some always visions really

552
00:35:06,630 --> 00:35:12,030
just would provide less deleted scene
that this I miss

553
00:35:12,030 --> 00:35:15,270
it's gonna be some someone has to be
proved

554
00:35:15,270 --> 00:35:19,270
few times that

555
00:35:19,270 --> 00:35:23,020
the circus which forbid will doesn't
mean it could mean the

556
00:35:23,020 --> 00:35:27,509
be seen the ltée this some sort of
circuit-switched

557
00:35:27,510 --> 00:35:30,950
inside you could build mean that

558
00:35:30,950 --> 00:35:34,118
you if the LTTE

559
00:35:34,119 --> 00:35:38,940
discovers the the old the use justin's
circus which they did

560
00:35:38,940 --> 00:35:43,010
for me it the call was handed over to

561
00:35:43,010 --> 00:35:46,869
3G would Kors handed over to 2g

562
00:35:46,869 --> 00:35:50,190
because that because maybe 2g some

563
00:35:50,190 --> 00:35:53,480
begin 2 G's perfect was

564
00:35:53,480 --> 00:35:57,750
and facilities perfect with the to me

565
00:35:57,750 --> 00:36:02,970
and inside is a subscribed indication
that I miss

566
00:36:02,970 --> 00:36:07,170
so this is simply a indications as well
with you

567
00:36:07,170 --> 00:36:10,680
and some sort X is not refundable

568
00:36:10,680 --> 00:36:14,009
indication trusted no notifications

569
00:36:14,010 --> 00:36:17,280
this some ongoing

570
00:36:17,280 --> 00:36:20,770
seem inside is so

571
00:36:20,770 --> 00:36:25,120
as do some work to do inside I miss

572
00:36:25,120 --> 00:36:29,319
I thought the sees do not present
something particularly

573
00:36:29,319 --> 00:36:33,009
years old at least morning

574
00:36:33,010 --> 00:36:36,230
the morning listens that provides some
pretty nice old

575
00:36:36,230 --> 00:36:39,280
provide these yet some some

576
00:36:39,280 --> 00:36:42,750
no of registration

577
00:36:42,750 --> 00:36:46,260
from all that to see

578
00:36:46,260 --> 00:36:48,500
way up

579
00:36:48,500 --> 00:36:52,230
for for voice been weakened

580
00:36:52,230 --> 00:36:55,910
for unprotected sex is and

581
00:36:55,910 --> 00:37:01,819
did

582
00:37:01,820 --> 00:37:05,010
in because basically i sees nothing you

583
00:37:05,010 --> 00:37:08,020
seems is a some homes

584
00:37:08,020 --> 00:37:11,990
to was away p but the there exists

585
00:37:11,990 --> 00:37:18,990
on the interface some predicted yours

586
00:37:22,610 --> 00:37:25,760
for the future then and this

587
00:37:25,760 --> 00:37:28,800
source that you could buy some home

588
00:37:28,800 --> 00:37:31,870
you will be even I heard 2d

589
00:37:31,870 --> 00:37:35,180
did these picassos there already

590
00:37:35,180 --> 00:37:40,450
real and there's gonna be some work on
that soon

591
00:37:40,450 --> 00:37:43,590
to to get some some

592
00:37:43,590 --> 00:37:48,100
deeply into this because the story is
Aliyah mainly using some

593
00:37:48,100 --> 00:37:54,160
unsecured network to the operator and
operated itself provides

594
00:37:54,160 --> 00:37:57,500
security and yet

595
00:37:57,500 --> 00:38:01,850
there needs to be some device
authentication and that's mandatory for

596
00:38:01,850 --> 00:38:02,370
this

597
00:38:02,370 --> 00:38:05,890
home he'd be listed and

598
00:38:05,890 --> 00:38:10,190
I mean it's gonna be question for the
future if this whole UV blue

599
00:38:10,190 --> 00:38:14,720
you come I don't know if there's gonna
be some some success in the future

600
00:38:14,720 --> 00:38:17,910
it could be love it if the for it
doesn't provide

601
00:38:17,910 --> 00:38:21,569
any coverage and I did my coverage

602
00:38:21,570 --> 00:38:24,820
mustard the

603
00:38:24,820 --> 00:38:28,690
gonna be some strategy for the bridges
maybe cool is very

604
00:38:28,690 --> 00:38:31,900
and yet this

605
00:38:31,900 --> 00:38:35,350
this on securing its good I mean these

606
00:38:35,350 --> 00:38:39,250
is really unsecured so everything
happens

607
00:38:39,250 --> 00:38:42,970
everything would wills Mankin

608
00:38:42,970 --> 00:38:47,530
believe happens here and

609
00:38:47,530 --> 00:38:50,530
for us with this is some some sort

610
00:38:50,530 --> 00:38:56,760
secured in other thing that you're
thinking in ltée

611
00:38:56,760 --> 00:39:00,250
uses to provides a read really would

612
00:39:00,250 --> 00:39:03,990
they were really think that

613
00:39:03,990 --> 00:39:07,960
fuji's the seemed form 3G but

614
00:39:07,960 --> 00:39:11,420
I think the story for 2g/3g scum budetti

615
00:39:11,420 --> 00:39:16,540
still alive and still under study if
that's gonna happen because it is

616
00:39:16,540 --> 00:39:18,150
usually considered

617
00:39:18,150 --> 00:39:24,030
everything happens on the same frequency
it could be the

618
00:39:24,030 --> 00:39:27,040
move-in I mean my

619
00:39:27,040 --> 00:39:30,190
and you know what some other time
someone

620
00:39:30,190 --> 00:39:33,720
could you text is it really and forwards

621
00:39:33,720 --> 00:39:37,040
picket to the user or

622
00:39:37,040 --> 00:39:44,040
vice versa into the hood and the world

623
00:39:44,120 --> 00:39:48,400
use it really happens is because this is
really no idea

624
00:39:48,400 --> 00:39:53,560
there's gonna be some security issues
and inside the real you know the the

625
00:39:53,560 --> 00:39:57,070
that can happen everything you can you
can use

626
00:39:57,070 --> 00:40:01,660
still

627
00:40:01,660 --> 00:40:05,310
basically that was it

628
00:40:05,310 --> 00:40:09,250
if you want think 12

629
00:40:09,250 --> 00:40:12,540
conflict between just completely am keen
to

630
00:40:12,540 --> 00:40:17,090
for you and

631
00:40:17,090 --> 00:40:21,770
things for attention if you have some
questions don't hesitate to us

632
00:40:21,770 --> 00:40:28,770
questions

633
00:40:34,290 --> 00:40:36,110
I'm request in writing that day

634
00:40:36,110 --> 00:40:39,430
usuals seen that yet he said

635
00:40:39,430 --> 00:40:43,890
donald was to music on them while the
mines had the impression that they were

636
00:40:43,890 --> 00:40:45,200
to meet on the No

637
00:40:45,200 --> 00:40:49,310
be that they were going from the me to
the dude we
