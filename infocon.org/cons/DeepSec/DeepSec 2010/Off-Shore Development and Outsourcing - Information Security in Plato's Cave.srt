3
00:00:20,550 --> 00:00:23,730
security skated and focusing on the

4
00:00:23,730 --> 00:00:26,900
offshore development and outsourcing
which

5
00:00:26,900 --> 00:00:30,490
is quite interesting topics is couple
years especially in

6
00:00:30,490 --> 00:00:34,059
euro were couple of companies or
thinking about

7
00:00:34,059 --> 00:00:37,349

other persons dreaming up new services
near used to

9
00:00:40,780 --> 00:00:44,170
it's a establish new possible Tuesday

10
00:00:44,170 --> 00:00:48,250
gauge money to engage you work gets the
company's

11
00:00:48,250 --> 00:00:53,120
just as they were this talk it does not
contain any kind of

12
00:00:53,120 --> 00:00:57,030
in-depth technical techie

13
00:00:57,030 --> 00:01:00,409
script whatever stuff it's more about
security awareness

14
00:01:00,409 --> 00:01:04,610
more about security architecture
management the second thing is

15
00:01:04,610 --> 00:01:08,010
on this stuff is definitely not reflect
the opinions of my employer

16
00:01:08,010 --> 00:01:12,790
following players I'm plant working and
security management consulting

17
00:01:12,790 --> 00:01:16,580
and talking pictures and here's time
working right now is the door

18
00:01:16,580 --> 00:01:19,960
Germany address huge upload with people
to

19
00:01:19,960 --> 00:01:23,110
would like to have some additional
information or would like to have some

20
00:01:23,110 --> 00:01:28,110
ex lives were slaughtered for me not
installed correctly

21
00:01:28,110 --> 00:01:33,430
before I'm going to given to the topic
of Pluto into things

22
00:01:33,430 --> 00:01:37,000
his was offshoring was outsourcing
what's the real

23
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:40,530
mission up offshoring is more the word
about this

24
00:01:40,530 --> 00:01:44,039
power generator water windmills

25
00:01:44,039 --> 00:01:48,729
the water thing which means on couple of
energy-producing companies

26
00:01:48,729 --> 00:01:52,810
placing the windmills anywhere near
where nobody lives want to seem to get

27
00:01:52,810 --> 00:01:57,799
power and this plant or out of their
territory there sometimes

28
00:01:57,799 --> 00:02:01,329
in international waters not directly
below to a certain country

29
00:02:01,329 --> 00:02:05,079
outsourcing is when you're thinking
about to giveaways

30
00:02:05,079 --> 00:02:08,750
certain things hold your company out of
your environment

31
00:02:08,750 --> 00:02:12,780
to somebody else in offshoring
especially when you're talking about

32
00:02:12,780 --> 00:02:16,240
buying develops knowledge or development

33
00:02:16,240 --> 00:02:19,290
from other companies but not sitting in
your house onshore

34
00:02:19,290 --> 00:02:22,970
pluto

35
00:02:22,970 --> 00:02:27,800
class K it's a myth it's on plot a route
once a letter

36
00:02:27,800 --> 00:02:31,090
to couple friends and he

37
00:02:31,090 --> 00:02:34,959
some up it's about having people in the
cave

38
00:02:34,959 --> 00:02:38,970
this people think that's the reality and

39
00:02:38,970 --> 00:02:42,930
on they have to interpret a interpret

40
00:02:42,930 --> 00:02:46,510
the world they realize he woulda shoulda
or on

41
00:02:46,510 --> 00:02:50,310
I've had contact with plateaus longer
delivery

42
00:02:50,310 --> 00:02:54,540
India museum actually shadows and Cheryl
making things

43
00:02:54,540 --> 00:02:57,609
and I was pretty impressed thought about
world the would

44
00:02:57,610 --> 00:03:01,370
possibility to explain what's actually
happening we're talking about

45
00:03:01,370 --> 00:03:02,090
outsourcing

46
00:03:02,090 --> 00:03:05,129
you're talking about possible City to
give things away

47
00:03:05,129 --> 00:03:08,179
other before

48
00:03:08,180 --> 00:03:11,950
I'm going to explain it in detail with
gloves meaning and things

49
00:03:11,950 --> 00:03:16,470
found a very nice you two wheel which
describes what is actually all about

50
00:03:16,470 --> 00:03:16,879
this

51
00:03:16,879 --> 00:03:21,459
and their modeling called

52
00:03:21,459 --> 00:03:25,220
modeling go German words can lead to
anarchy

53
00:03:25,220 --> 00:03:32,220
mussah where people made a movie out
that just a minute

54
00:04:04,750 --> 00:04:11,750
one

55
00:04:30,820 --> 00:04:37,820
them

56
00:04:47,320 --> 00:04:51,248
of

57
00:04:51,249 --> 00:04:58,249
nine

58
00:05:01,950 --> 00:05:03,229
them

59
00:05:03,230 --> 00:05:06,990
no

60
00:05:06,990 --> 00:05:10,979
drugs millions the world outside the
gate for the very first time

61
00:05:10,979 --> 00:05:17,979
%uh there's like nothing

62
00:05:23,440 --> 00:05:25,830
hmm

63
00:05:25,830 --> 00:05:28,280
love

64
00:05:28,280 --> 00:05:31,330
served

65
00:05:31,330 --> 00:05:34,440
Twitter's friends to share Incredibles

66
00:05:34,440 --> 00:05:38,510
up well

67
00:05:38,510 --> 00:05:41,550
but the business community recognized

68
00:05:41,550 --> 00:05:45,020
friend his things do

69
00:05:45,020 --> 00:05:48,150
his voice is it distorted

70
00:05:48,150 --> 00:05:53,580
girl his body is a grotesque shared

71
00:05:53,580 --> 00:05:57,260
they cannot understand this fantastic
stories in the world

72
00:05:57,260 --> 00:06:00,400
inside the cave to them

73
00:06:00,400 --> 00:06:05,130
people never exist this is close

74
00:06:05,130 --> 00:06:09,790
does not make the world outside at the
cave in

75
00:06:09,790 --> 00:06:14,419
miss real in

76
00:06:14,419 --> 00:06:21,419
so

77
00:06:22,710 --> 00:06:28,000
contentious so this Louis was to give
you more explanation

78
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:32,430
better insulation what actually this
cave is and which kinda humans we have

79
00:06:32,430 --> 00:06:39,260
on we're actually in the position right
now that we have been and real-world

80
00:06:39,260 --> 00:06:43,520
and we're standing K why because

81
00:06:43,520 --> 00:06:46,979
on warranty K and

82
00:06:46,979 --> 00:06:50,120
the Cape sexual situation we are
elsewhere bring

83
00:06:50,120 --> 00:06:53,290
things two worlds collide and we say
well we're not

84
00:06:53,290 --> 00:06:57,050
and in the real world anymore on which a
not so

85
00:06:57,050 --> 00:07:00,740
indicated was a kind of weird

86
00:07:00,740 --> 00:07:06,669
go into detail about weird

87
00:07:06,669 --> 00:07:10,190
and a very bottom up this little picture

88
00:07:10,190 --> 00:07:14,430
we are you okay we know that there's a
cave and we know that their shadow

89
00:07:14,430 --> 00:07:17,580
we see the shadows second circle

90
00:07:17,580 --> 00:07:20,680
there's there's this objects or things

91
00:07:20,680 --> 00:07:24,850
which actually cost the shadows and the
fire itself and there's the real world

92
00:07:24,850 --> 00:07:27,979
the real world is actually what we're
having I T

93
00:07:27,979 --> 00:07:31,789
and our almighty overall companies we
have a direct influence

94
00:07:31,789 --> 00:07:36,840
entities what's actually happening about
servers are all the applications which

95
00:07:36,840 --> 00:07:39,860
architecture having which kinda process
we have behind that

96
00:07:39,860 --> 00:07:43,639
but when we thinking about outsourcing
we pushing ourselves

97
00:07:43,639 --> 00:07:47,650
2k with pushing ourselves a situation
when

98
00:07:47,650 --> 00:07:51,460
somebody else managing the real world
managing the

99
00:07:51,460 --> 00:07:55,669
situation which kind of reality we're
going to be

100
00:07:55,669 --> 00:08:01,889
be displayed as I mentioned

101
00:08:01,889 --> 00:08:05,880
we're prisoners when we're going to
think about outsourcing

102
00:08:05,880 --> 00:08:08,969
we're bringing somebody else in position
to show somebody

103
00:08:08,970 --> 00:08:12,690
to make this something new visible which
is actually happening

104
00:08:12,690 --> 00:08:18,160
up changed our interpretation

105
00:08:18,160 --> 00:08:21,570
of which should be implemented talk
about security

106
00:08:21,570 --> 00:08:25,669
yes talking about personal fines about
policies talk about controls

107
00:08:25,669 --> 00:08:29,490
so controlled shatters

108
00:08:29,490 --> 00:08:32,860
we're sitting day shadows our
understanding

109
00:08:32,860 --> 00:08:36,789
all want two things might be that must
not be because

110
00:08:36,789 --> 00:08:40,370
s also shown shuttle the movie itself

111
00:08:40,370 --> 00:08:45,010
shadows kinda grotesque the people
sitting indicated

112
00:08:45,010 --> 00:08:48,600
sometimes knowing or not knowing whether
real world is

113
00:08:48,600 --> 00:08:53,140
just understand users shadow something
might be happening they're going to

114
00:08:53,140 --> 00:08:56,150
try to understand what me but

115
00:08:56,150 --> 00:08:59,300
without clearly defining what they're
really like to

116
00:08:59,300 --> 00:09:02,480
Ortiz needs to see to understand what's

117
00:09:02,480 --> 00:09:06,430
really happening Andy level fire or into
reality

118
00:09:06,430 --> 00:09:09,730
objects absolutely no working

119
00:09:09,730 --> 00:09:13,720
the objects Wenger

120
00:09:13,720 --> 00:09:17,980
and my picture in the second layer
objectors

121
00:09:17,980 --> 00:09:21,820
thing word outsourcer and points able to

122
00:09:21,820 --> 00:09:26,910
show to describes with what kind of
Shadows

123
00:09:26,910 --> 00:09:30,589
piano display

124
00:09:30,589 --> 00:09:34,640
wall you supply here you know it's also
the person you're going to trust

125
00:09:34,640 --> 00:09:38,709
bring over unity is the person who
produced shadows he has the Arctic

126
00:09:38,709 --> 00:09:42,300
artifactId as the objects and shamans

127
00:09:42,300 --> 00:09:46,560
fired to cast a shadow and

128
00:09:46,560 --> 00:09:50,480
you are actually the one who's

129
00:09:50,480 --> 00:09:57,480
sorry I missed kinda red line

130
00:10:00,720 --> 00:10:04,070
the person who is producing shadow cat

131
00:10:04,070 --> 00:10:08,290
modified just fires still can modify all
the objects are

132
00:10:08,290 --> 00:10:11,430
presented to what's fired to create
shadow

133
00:10:11,430 --> 00:10:14,890
and fire is actually what we can

134
00:10:14,890 --> 00:10:19,019
understand ourselves compliance fires

135
00:10:19,019 --> 00:10:22,029
can be your rules at definition can be
standards

136
00:10:22,029 --> 00:10:25,820
to say well we would like to see that
that way we would like to have that

137
00:10:25,820 --> 00:10:29,490
controls we would like to know constant
reality

138
00:10:29,490 --> 00:10:34,110
in or living environment what does it
mean

139
00:10:34,110 --> 00:10:37,480
technically words or technical words we
have for examples

140
00:10:37,480 --> 00:10:40,620
seventy report 12 when you're examples

141
00:10:40,620 --> 00:10:45,089
somebody to give his seventy report
together and also very good

142
00:10:45,089 --> 00:10:45,800
understanding

143
00:10:45,800 --> 00:10:49,940
communications or depresses or what you
expected

144
00:10:49,940 --> 00:10:53,300
or you have another I suppose that 2007

145
00:10:53,300 --> 00:10:58,220
2001 whatever to describe more or less
than a very high level

146
00:10:58,220 --> 00:11:01,290
how you can implement

147
00:11:01,290 --> 00:11:05,390
compliance implement security implement
security management

148
00:11:05,390 --> 00:11:09,490
what actually is done it's not possible
to see because you're not really

149
00:11:09,490 --> 00:11:13,380
directly in that not and not in your
work anymore

150
00:11:13,380 --> 00:11:18,079
cost you outsourced the real world

151
00:11:18,079 --> 00:11:21,800
still office level with being still gets
when your company

152
00:11:21,800 --> 00:11:23,670
for example outsourcing

153
00:11:23,670 --> 00:11:26,750
yeah the daylight which is very straight

154
00:11:26,750 --> 00:11:30,830
when you know you know in this morning
it afternoon you know that their

155
00:11:30,830 --> 00:11:34,220
different kind of channels you know that
can be good colors

156
00:11:34,220 --> 00:11:38,120
everything's perfect speaking of
technically

157
00:11:38,120 --> 00:11:41,540
we have steered we have insider mation

158
00:11:41,540 --> 00:11:44,730
flown way we have information wall for
companies

159
00:11:44,730 --> 00:11:48,120
attacking you company your customers
would like to steal

160
00:11:48,120 --> 00:11:51,140
formation you we have winter problems

161
00:11:51,140 --> 00:11:55,210
you buy and hardware which might be
invulnerable

162
00:11:55,210 --> 00:11:58,390
you might have external threats we would
never

163
00:11:58,390 --> 00:12:01,590
thought about before this is what
actually happened you know

164
00:12:01,590 --> 00:12:05,970
world reeled but in the real world
there's

165
00:12:05,970 --> 00:12:09,280
something like good good things

166
00:12:09,280 --> 00:12:13,839
a somebody who's really understand
security

167
00:12:13,840 --> 00:12:17,690
persons like you and me thinking about
security all the time

168
00:12:17,690 --> 00:12:21,150
thinking about possibility to use spread
the words to

169
00:12:21,150 --> 00:12:24,949
make other people understanding what
security at security management for

170
00:12:24,950 --> 00:12:25,790
example is

171
00:12:25,790 --> 00:12:30,230
when like in the movie we're coming out
again

172
00:12:30,230 --> 00:12:34,140
order we're being there sometimes they
don't harass

173
00:12:34,140 --> 00:12:37,520
we know realities no sometimes very nice
about

174
00:12:37,520 --> 00:12:43,930
we also know that this could be Realty
so

175
00:12:43,930 --> 00:12:47,390
bringing the another delivery

176
00:12:47,390 --> 00:12:53,360
together with our to world topic we have
been outside we know it very well

177
00:12:53,360 --> 00:12:58,170
we know what kind of standard possible
we know we were driving or alrighty what

178
00:12:58,170 --> 00:12:58,910
we actually

179
00:12:58,910 --> 00:13:02,120
its ability to focus on so

180
00:13:02,120 --> 00:13:05,880
the next thing is we know that there are
real check that there are real

181
00:13:05,880 --> 00:13:08,990
a real flyer there are certain things we
can check

182
00:13:08,990 --> 00:13:14,210
for example dude controls focusing on
certain topics

183
00:13:14,210 --> 00:13:17,670
we've seen and we know that things cost

184
00:13:17,670 --> 00:13:21,850
shadows cell we were thinking you know

185
00:13:21,850 --> 00:13:25,310
offshore development outsourcing T
information things

186
00:13:25,310 --> 00:13:29,280
and we're thinking also about
outsourcing that

187
00:13:29,280 --> 00:13:33,150
giving away d things where control
before we're

188
00:13:33,150 --> 00:13:37,430
the K when we're in a cave with you

189
00:13:37,430 --> 00:13:41,280
controlled fire we do not currently have
control in the shadows

190
00:13:41,280 --> 00:13:44,760
but the major difference between pluto

191
00:13:44,760 --> 00:13:49,710
and our examples when we're sitting and
decay

192
00:13:49,710 --> 00:13:53,460
and your outsourcer that case the person

193
00:13:53,460 --> 00:13:58,140
very close to the fire his costing the
shadows we were able to speak with them

194
00:13:58,140 --> 00:14:01,390
were able to say well police

195
00:14:01,390 --> 00:14:04,580
can you highlight certain things please

196
00:14:04,580 --> 00:14:08,100
can you produce that at all because then
we can believe that

197
00:14:08,100 --> 00:14:11,220
that's that objector

198
00:14:11,220 --> 00:14:15,570
rule than that lamentation last but not
least because

199
00:14:15,570 --> 00:14:20,700
changed K what we're talking about

200
00:14:20,700 --> 00:14:24,460
offshoring and outsourcing their
different types of things

201
00:14:24,460 --> 00:14:28,850
were actually happened with I'm pretty
sure a lot of companies do

202
00:14:28,850 --> 00:14:31,880
a lot of companies to definitely
outsourcing

203
00:14:31,880 --> 00:14:36,430
types of consulting services which means
when you're a limit on resources for

204
00:14:36,430 --> 00:14:37,020
Yukon

205
00:14:37,020 --> 00:14:40,980
buy or hire employees on the market
specific no

206
00:14:40,980 --> 00:14:44,680
fine solvency when you're thinking about
his

207
00:14:44,680 --> 00:14:49,060
for sale cloud services it's quite
interesting we're talking about it.

208
00:14:49,060 --> 00:14:52,690
posting only certain parts Europe
cations running

209
00:14:52,690 --> 00:14:57,320
for example anywhere not on your side
you can outsource

210
00:14:57,320 --> 00:15:00,660
week offshore development which means
for example

211
00:15:00,660 --> 00:15:03,800
your specific market specifically

212
00:15:03,800 --> 00:15:07,770
like real fast reaction development so
you might

213
00:15:07,770 --> 00:15:10,810
thing well I'm not hiring

214
00:15:10,810 --> 00:15:14,390
a lot of developers my side I would like
to have just resources

215
00:15:14,390 --> 00:15:18,990
ready when the project started so what
you can do is for example by developers

216
00:15:18,990 --> 00:15:23,180
India when developers anyway euro
anywhere in South Africa or South

217
00:15:23,180 --> 00:15:23,940
America

218
00:15:23,940 --> 00:15:27,390
so you just bring over the idea what to
develop a new to old

219
00:15:27,390 --> 00:15:32,740
development the the non-technical part
your site describe what you really would

220
00:15:32,740 --> 00:15:35,000
like to happen then you should head over
and say well

221
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:39,010
me until that date send me back your
information

222
00:15:39,010 --> 00:15:43,020
word and you can sort

223
00:15:43,020 --> 00:15:46,930
parts okay I T what part the company for
some

224
00:15:46,930 --> 00:15:51,740
project management good example were a
lot of companies thinking about their

225
00:15:51,740 --> 00:15:52,640
splitting

226
00:15:52,640 --> 00:15:55,770
project management which absolutely
possible work to you

227
00:15:55,770 --> 00:15:58,990
to outsource or two to

228
00:15:58,990 --> 00:16:02,850
by consultancy by the way you can also
outsource

229
00:16:02,850 --> 00:16:06,670
each part because also not want to pay
some core services your company normally

230
00:16:06,670 --> 00:16:07,310
house

231
00:16:07,310 --> 00:16:10,650
for you can buyouts or sell

232
00:16:10,650 --> 00:16:13,770
outsource you complete T which means
partner

233
00:16:13,770 --> 00:16:16,880
for example when you're when you're
holding a bakery

234
00:16:16,880 --> 00:16:22,390
you too low rare pretzels and Brett's

235
00:16:22,390 --> 00:16:26,230
whatever on your your

236
00:16:26,230 --> 00:16:30,570
core business is doing bakery stuff not
I T so when you're thinking about well

237
00:16:30,570 --> 00:16:31,920
why not do some

238
00:16:31,920 --> 00:16:37,070
online shop things for my print stuff
and send it over you can buy and

239
00:16:37,070 --> 00:16:40,860
I services for you 19 transfer

240
00:16:40,860 --> 00:16:44,000
or services for shipping cost

241
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:48,080
or online services or a combination
between online shop and

242
00:16:48,080 --> 00:16:53,320
delivery service so what's the real
reason to do that

243
00:16:53,320 --> 00:16:56,840
next to him again does

244
00:16:56,840 --> 00:16:59,960
which might be totally political mostly
it's

245
00:16:59,960 --> 00:17:03,850
getting rid of people getting things way

246
00:17:03,850 --> 00:17:07,000
certain non-core business or getting old

247
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:10,380
last but not least getting rid guilty
because I T sometimes not

248
00:17:10,380 --> 00:17:14,640
period really polls even for example in
financial environment

249
00:17:14,640 --> 00:17:19,720
you for example trading environments
people are thinking well we're trading

250
00:17:19,720 --> 00:17:24,640
most applications based on it. they're
doing a lot of information

251
00:17:24,640 --> 00:17:28,370
world processing on it. but they're not
thinking about

252
00:17:28,370 --> 00:17:31,830
this is really a one other court

253
00:17:31,830 --> 00:17:35,909
and and also on last but not least
talking about money everybody spoke with

254
00:17:35,910 --> 00:17:40,550
does outsourcing follow outsourcing or
offshoring whatever

255
00:17:40,550 --> 00:17:45,240
on managed to say well it's all about
costs were sending costs but it's

256
00:17:45,240 --> 00:17:46,750
definitely not

257
00:17:46,750 --> 00:17:50,130
because lonely when you're outsource
your first

258
00:17:50,130 --> 00:17:53,440
lot should help start

259
00:17:53,440 --> 00:17:57,040
a very big project think about really
would like to do

260
00:17:57,040 --> 00:18:01,129
and think next thing and sometimes takes
over one to three years

261
00:18:01,130 --> 00:18:04,130
to really holds or is part complete Park

262
00:18:04,130 --> 00:18:07,820
T so when everybody says well with the
flow

263
00:18:07,820 --> 00:18:10,929
cost no way second is

264
00:18:10,930 --> 00:18:15,150
it's like Rosie everybody talks about
returns security investment

265
00:18:15,150 --> 00:18:18,820
tonight's party but no one really stuff
listed in the company

266
00:18:18,820 --> 00:18:23,340
so say

267
00:18:23,340 --> 00:18:27,209
this were already mentioned on

268
00:18:27,210 --> 00:18:31,120
we have been outside nowhere in sight
know we're going to try to rid

269
00:18:31,120 --> 00:18:34,180
watershed what's actually happening and

270
00:18:34,180 --> 00:18:37,250
have what is the difference between
shadow an hour

271
00:18:37,250 --> 00:18:40,750
you world which means within the case
with the K

272
00:18:40,750 --> 00:18:44,480
or what is said the difference to the
rewire itself

273
00:18:44,480 --> 00:18:49,100
which means we know what we can control.
we know what there is

274
00:18:49,100 --> 00:18:55,410
we know what there was to know we have
to make a match

275
00:18:55,410 --> 00:18:59,080
so we want okay

276
00:18:59,080 --> 00:19:04,110
we know is pretty slim shadows we can
change the situation here we go

277
00:19:04,110 --> 00:19:07,370
that is

278
00:19:07,370 --> 00:19:11,160
we actually have to do have to think
about what's to which kinda world

279
00:19:11,160 --> 00:19:16,200
permission to win even okay to to
regulate even when we're doing outsource

280
00:19:16,200 --> 00:19:19,410
and then you can say well I might be a
lot of things to do

281
00:19:19,410 --> 00:19:22,730
yes course can standards

282
00:19:22,730 --> 00:19:26,580
standards industry stars love crazy

283
00:19:26,580 --> 00:19:31,240
love sometimes really good stuff popped
up last couple years a lot of fun

284
00:19:31,240 --> 00:19:35,910
outsources also present but we've
anybody you working for an outsourcer

285
00:19:35,910 --> 00:19:39,580
offshore serves company

286
00:19:39,580 --> 00:19:42,980
no could

287
00:19:42,980 --> 00:19:46,690
sas70 reports it's a great opportunity
to you

288
00:19:46,690 --> 00:19:50,910
ask for its great opportunity to show up
to the auditors and say well we have to

289
00:19:50,910 --> 00:19:52,870
supply already we have somebody

290
00:19:52,870 --> 00:19:57,030
hearing with and binding contract you
can show up to 70% report

291
00:19:57,030 --> 00:20:00,360
seventh report shows up on

292
00:20:00,360 --> 00:20:03,730
in DEP security aspect nothing

293
00:20:03,730 --> 00:20:09,090
same like Isaac 2001 or implementation
of the 2005

294
00:20:09,090 --> 00:20:13,070
when you're certified your certified to
a certain point it suspects

295
00:20:13,070 --> 00:20:16,870
where auditors delivered company thought
about

296
00:20:16,870 --> 00:20:21,720
iPhone checklist but in my opinion on
what I experienced the worst Auto yet

297
00:20:21,720 --> 00:20:25,480
the diversification does not really
described

298
00:20:25,480 --> 00:20:29,320
this person is really sure they have a
certain aspect implemented their

299
00:20:29,320 --> 00:20:32,780
very good ideas sometimes hurt
themselves a very good

300
00:20:32,780 --> 00:20:36,540
change management board management or
service management or whatever

301
00:20:36,540 --> 00:20:39,850
but they're not on

302
00:20:39,850 --> 00:20:43,150
well they might be secure more secure

303
00:20:43,150 --> 00:20:46,150
as you are asking for fuking for

304
00:20:46,150 --> 00:20:49,180
pots on the this kind of standards

305
00:20:49,180 --> 00:20:52,870
does not show that its more let's
compare Apple

306
00:20:52,870 --> 00:20:56,760
but you cannot say well we have two
competitors we would like to challenge

307
00:20:56,760 --> 00:21:00,030
and both have to use a seventy report
and as old one

308
00:21:00,030 --> 00:21:03,139
a as a whole ex-wife that

309
00:21:03,140 --> 00:21:06,540
certificate and license on which ones
better

310
00:21:06,540 --> 00:21:10,690
you have to looked at what's happening
with code standards for example we have

311
00:21:10,690 --> 00:21:14,990
title standards we have PCI DSS which
came up in last couple years

312
00:21:14,990 --> 00:21:19,500
pretty pretty money making thing

313
00:21:19,500 --> 00:21:23,240
on next to the industry standard to a
lot of

314
00:21:23,240 --> 00:21:26,670
baselines government suspects which
incoming

315
00:21:26,670 --> 00:21:30,880
policy specific laws force public policy
specific guidelines

316
00:21:30,880 --> 00:21:34,580
development guidelines and the other
company which might not be called

317
00:21:34,580 --> 00:21:37,730
comparable to you develop guidelines
before

318
00:21:37,730 --> 00:21:42,620
individual compliance checks companies
maturity level which means

319
00:21:42,620 --> 00:21:45,670
sometimes your maturity level might not
be the same

320
00:21:45,670 --> 00:21:49,590
might be lower or higher and maturity
level of to probe the company you buy

321
00:21:49,590 --> 00:21:50,639
and

322
00:21:50,640 --> 00:21:53,870
I experience one time that and accompany

323
00:21:53,870 --> 00:21:57,270
outsourced a certain parts of it.

324
00:21:57,270 --> 00:22:01,990
and said Well we do it with company in
India and then after a roundabout year

325
00:22:01,990 --> 00:22:06,950
of up challenging both sides they
realize that the maturity level of two

326
00:22:06,950 --> 00:22:08,750
Indian company was much more

327
00:22:08,750 --> 00:22:12,580
higher very specific in that very good
at his wife to

328
00:22:12,580 --> 00:22:16,870
practice how to about due process is how
to document

329
00:22:16,870 --> 00:22:20,120
and the company would actually orders
stuff where

330
00:22:20,120 --> 00:22:24,170
able to compare cost a maturity level
was too low to understand what they will

331
00:22:24,170 --> 00:22:27,610
do

332
00:22:27,610 --> 00:22:31,590
surrounding national lost another aspect
which is quite interesting when you're

333
00:22:31,590 --> 00:22:33,290
doing business in europe

334
00:22:33,290 --> 00:22:36,990
and you're doing business with companies
in Europe it's quite easy because the

335
00:22:36,990 --> 00:22:40,610
you European law and European
governments

336
00:22:40,610 --> 00:22:44,350
you local nationals but when you're
talking about inter

337
00:22:44,350 --> 00:22:47,770
now non-national or inter non Europe

338
00:22:47,770 --> 00:22:51,520
connections two words euro or two words

339
00:22:51,520 --> 00:22:55,210
a for example in here America Russia

340
00:22:55,210 --> 00:22:59,050
South Africa it's quite interesting to
get this all together

341
00:22:59,050 --> 00:23:02,639
to get this force for civil terrible to
on

342
00:23:02,640 --> 00:23:09,150
really make it possible for example to
transfer information

343
00:23:09,150 --> 00:23:12,320
well also for example when there are
certain friction loss

344
00:23:12,320 --> 00:23:15,429
place for example delivering information

345
00:23:15,430 --> 00:23:18,760
two words France towards china two words

346
00:23:18,760 --> 00:23:21,930
US might be interesting

347
00:23:21,930 --> 00:23:27,070
sometimes of course %um language
problems for example when your evidence

348
00:23:27,070 --> 00:23:30,450
french-speaking or german-speaking
company or like outsourcing their

349
00:23:30,450 --> 00:23:32,910
thinking about certain things to

350
00:23:32,910 --> 00:23:36,620
Brazil order to Indiana

351
00:23:36,620 --> 00:23:40,250
and not everybody your own company word
order and company

352
00:23:40,250 --> 00:23:43,890
as speak English so it might be
sometimes quite interesting

353
00:23:43,890 --> 00:23:48,420
to get to work done you would like to go
out so we would like to outsource

354
00:23:48,420 --> 00:23:52,670
and additionally if cultural problems

355
00:23:52,670 --> 00:23:56,020
coming back to the industry standards
even when there's

356
00:23:56,020 --> 00:23:59,400
industry standard you pretty described
in

357
00:23:59,400 --> 00:24:03,470
in detail pretty precise which kind of
change management you would like to see

358
00:24:03,470 --> 00:24:06,790
which kind controls you would like to
see which kinda evidence you would like

359
00:24:06,790 --> 00:24:08,080
to have when the audience

360
00:24:08,080 --> 00:24:13,280
even its so precise nobody really could
100 misunderstand

361
00:24:13,280 --> 00:24:17,780
descriptions coming from you from for
example European environment

362
00:24:17,780 --> 00:24:20,780
when you bring this over to China to
India

363
00:24:20,780 --> 00:24:24,379
to Brazil to whatever people might

364
00:24:24,380 --> 00:24:27,430
understand with you me but might deliver

365
00:24:27,430 --> 00:24:31,120
different evidence different aspects
which are not slip say

366
00:24:31,120 --> 00:24:36,120
match directly to that particular need

367
00:24:36,120 --> 00:24:40,030
risks and benefits

368
00:24:40,030 --> 00:24:44,360
when you say you would like to outsource
yes you put yourself in a position

369
00:24:44,360 --> 00:24:47,910
and Jen then you have to think about
what you really

370
00:24:47,910 --> 00:24:51,760
what's your definitely you real core
business

371
00:24:51,760 --> 00:24:55,370
and then you can say well I would like
to do that's because of certain things

372
00:24:55,370 --> 00:24:58,890
and other risks yes there are

373
00:24:58,890 --> 00:25:02,810
a and another thing I've learnt that

374
00:25:02,810 --> 00:25:06,110
sometimes it's very I interesting to
talk not about

375
00:25:06,110 --> 00:25:09,830
risks more talk about challenges or talk
about chances so

376
00:25:09,830 --> 00:25:13,570
on I tried to bring that in

377
00:25:13,570 --> 00:25:19,500
later on but we should also talk about
tell attentive

378
00:25:19,500 --> 00:25:22,600
were talking about this risk benefit
aspect confident suspects are

379
00:25:22,600 --> 00:25:23,570
interesting

380
00:25:23,570 --> 00:25:26,399
when you say would like you would like
to give something away for example your

381
00:25:26,400 --> 00:25:26,890
wallet

382
00:25:26,890 --> 00:25:30,950
with the complaints money which more or
less can be into

383
00:25:30,950 --> 00:25:34,720
can be your information your Holy Grail

384
00:25:34,720 --> 00:25:39,080
you give to somebody else you can use
more or less two things you can

385
00:25:39,080 --> 00:25:42,129
trust him like it too best bro

386
00:25:42,130 --> 00:25:45,700
or you can say what I would like to
control you these are

387
00:25:45,700 --> 00:25:49,690
to both suspects who have and

388
00:25:49,690 --> 00:25:53,600
to middle between is more or less to
exceed trip through see tourists which

389
00:25:53,600 --> 00:25:54,000
is

390
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:57,010
mostly done in the business which is
mostly done

391
00:25:57,010 --> 00:26:00,879
a risk controlled and welllll

392
00:26:00,880 --> 00:26:04,680
risk pushed environment for example
trading houses

393
00:26:04,680 --> 00:26:08,680
that's our job they're doing risk
acceptance for their

394
00:26:08,680 --> 00:26:12,600
pushing risks to get more money

395
00:26:12,600 --> 00:26:15,960
word real benefits on doing outsourcing

396
00:26:15,960 --> 00:26:20,220
doing bring let's say your Holy Grail

397
00:26:20,220 --> 00:26:25,170
into other company you're flexible for
example the consultancy inspector

398
00:26:25,170 --> 00:26:28,590
toll flexible when you run your complete
projects

399
00:26:28,590 --> 00:26:33,980
poured concrete project management by
consultancy company just plain resources

400
00:26:33,980 --> 00:26:39,080
without any problem when you say you
here next week their next week

401
00:26:39,080 --> 00:26:43,139
you can ton extend increased possible to
knowledge

402
00:26:43,140 --> 00:26:47,000
you can say well I would like to buy it
for example security calls consultancy

403
00:26:47,000 --> 00:26:50,690
and they have to train our
administrators perfect

404
00:26:50,690 --> 00:26:55,030
you can also increase your your business
as I mentioned this

405
00:26:55,030 --> 00:26:58,080
transfer to Liberty deliver

406
00:26:58,080 --> 00:27:01,100
delivery online shop thing the bakery

407
00:27:01,100 --> 00:27:04,179
snow people to implement it.

408
00:27:04,179 --> 00:27:09,179
s normal it. persons do so they buying
the resources and say well

409
00:27:09,179 --> 00:27:12,660
other people can do better here we go

410
00:27:12,660 --> 00:27:16,240
whatever risks tourists when you're
talking about a key partner in which

411
00:27:16,240 --> 00:27:17,679
means the total IT

412
00:27:17,679 --> 00:27:20,740
this away your giving away

413
00:27:20,740 --> 00:27:25,280
I T hart everything all servers services
all the applications all the connections

414
00:27:25,280 --> 00:27:28,510
all everything away to another company
you might

415
00:27:28,510 --> 00:27:32,429
lose your data you might have to
possibility

416
00:27:32,429 --> 00:27:36,060
to also loose control of the evidence is

417
00:27:36,060 --> 00:27:39,570
which means you don't have any evidence
is so when you order to sit here

418
00:27:39,570 --> 00:27:43,149
at the end of the year come up and say
well please show me where you yes and

419
00:27:43,150 --> 00:27:46,350
anywhere in the cloud key partner you
don't have a clue

420
00:27:46,350 --> 00:27:49,640
and that's what you have to say you're
losing also

421
00:27:49,640 --> 00:27:53,670
out possibility of influence
architecture for example

422
00:27:53,670 --> 00:27:57,179
then when you're outsourcing for your
ordering

423
00:27:57,179 --> 00:28:01,290
it. for company you know only say

424
00:28:01,290 --> 00:28:05,060
I would like to have web services but
you're not having possibility to discuss

425
00:28:05,060 --> 00:28:07,230
well I would like to have that kind of
production

426
00:28:07,230 --> 00:28:10,480
conversion I would like to have a I'm
prefer

427
00:28:10,480 --> 00:28:13,530
for example WebSphere tom cat or

428
00:28:13,530 --> 00:28:17,020
not I ask whatever and

429
00:28:17,020 --> 00:28:20,310
there's a risk that your IT partner
which lights have

430
00:28:20,310 --> 00:28:23,899
different or certain clients they might

431
00:28:23,900 --> 00:28:27,990
planetary information which makes it up
for example when they're not say

432
00:28:27,990 --> 00:28:31,600
creating databases where store your data
is stored

433
00:28:31,600 --> 00:28:37,080
sometimes happens I for that data it's
mixed up

434
00:28:37,080 --> 00:28:40,149
when you're a liar sourcing part
security

435
00:28:40,150 --> 00:28:43,170
for example application management

436
00:28:43,170 --> 00:28:48,290
only or others urs you might lose all to
company data

437
00:28:48,290 --> 00:28:51,440
you might also lose knowledge the
application or

438
00:28:51,440 --> 00:28:55,630
first okay you lose when your sizing up
project management only

439
00:28:55,630 --> 00:28:59,570
you might also lose knowledge of how to
project manage

440
00:28:59,570 --> 00:29:03,600
works or lose knowledge of the
application itself or

441
00:29:03,600 --> 00:29:08,290
business knowledge sometimes also very
important to help direct contact into

442
00:29:08,290 --> 00:29:09,159
the business

443
00:29:09,160 --> 00:29:16,160
which is internally more possible than
work an excellent

444
00:29:17,940 --> 00:29:21,630
as I mentioned support a consulting can
be outsourced

445
00:29:21,630 --> 00:29:25,020
which means also that your the risk on
knowledge

446
00:29:25,020 --> 00:29:28,889
can be lost or knowledge is transferred
and

447
00:29:28,890 --> 00:29:34,350
a that the real that the results which
were produced for your side is reused

448
00:29:34,350 --> 00:29:37,470
last but not least when you're also
having

449
00:29:37,470 --> 00:29:41,020
consult seem to your company for you
dark outsource

450
00:29:41,020 --> 00:29:45,300
certain things to consultancy you might
have risks and integrity of

451
00:29:45,300 --> 00:29:46,690
confidentiality

452
00:29:46,690 --> 00:29:50,550
because a lot of updated change it's not
possible

453
00:29:50,550 --> 00:29:53,669
on with the security line for

454
00:29:53,670 --> 00:29:58,070
to do consultant to companies not so big
they're having a big PPI

455
00:29:58,070 --> 00:30:02,490
backbone they're having not secure
mailing services there's no possibility

456
00:30:02,490 --> 00:30:03,429
to

457
00:30:03,429 --> 00:30:07,170
to you on to

458
00:30:07,170 --> 00:30:13,760
send your data around me your big issues
when you doing development

459
00:30:13,760 --> 00:30:16,929
your outsourcing to complete development
yesterday

460
00:30:16,929 --> 00:30:20,720
the greats let's say issue to think
about local admin rights

461
00:30:20,720 --> 00:30:24,059
and two special development equipment
which is actually happening when

462
00:30:24,059 --> 00:30:24,678
developers

463
00:30:24,679 --> 00:30:27,970
your house or develop sure they would
like to have standard rights

464
00:30:27,970 --> 00:30:31,260
really really really implement a

465
00:30:31,260 --> 00:30:35,330
in debt to install certain software when
you're sitting in there

466
00:30:35,330 --> 00:30:38,830
in your house which means to open your
environment possible somebody else

467
00:30:38,830 --> 00:30:39,960
developing for you

468
00:30:39,960 --> 00:30:43,830
you don't have a clue what's actually
running on their machines for a new

469
00:30:43,830 --> 00:30:44,570
machines

470
00:30:44,570 --> 00:30:49,710
by them having extended rights malicious
code in your source code or into binary

471
00:30:49,710 --> 00:30:50,780
might be a problem

472
00:30:50,780 --> 00:30:53,809
you don't have a clue what's actually
happening there lets you control is

473
00:30:53,809 --> 00:30:57,960
open source on conan close of 12 souls

474
00:30:57,960 --> 00:31:01,700
court sorry open source code close all
schools

475
00:31:01,700 --> 00:31:05,490
quite interesting aspect calls for
licensing which means for example when

476
00:31:05,490 --> 00:31:06,950
you ask certain developers

477
00:31:06,950 --> 00:31:10,240
to develop things for you too to well

478
00:31:10,240 --> 00:31:13,429
to find solutions and a just copy and
paste

479
00:31:13,429 --> 00:31:16,900
open source aspects which called
directly regulate because there's

480
00:31:16,900 --> 00:31:17,630
outsourced

481
00:31:17,630 --> 00:31:21,640
you get a license problem because then
they're breaking open source license

482
00:31:21,640 --> 00:31:25,020
then you might also bring other licenses
which are directly linked to that

483
00:31:25,020 --> 00:31:28,750
on or which is also doing the
consultancy way

484
00:31:28,750 --> 00:31:31,850
a reason you reviews hope snippets which
means

485
00:31:31,850 --> 00:31:35,590
on for example your trading business and
your

486
00:31:35,590 --> 00:31:40,580
would like to get development for
certain methods to create

487
00:31:40,580 --> 00:31:44,490
forecasts which is very important for
your business when you use

488
00:31:44,490 --> 00:31:47,950
this on methods in another

489
00:31:47,950 --> 00:31:52,429
let's say environment let's see your
competitor he might 3 uses

490
00:31:52,429 --> 00:31:55,620
test his model and endured

491
00:31:55,620 --> 00:31:59,050
do competitors having let's say on more

492
00:31:59,050 --> 00:32:03,399
on more information that you have that's
another aspect

493
00:32:03,400 --> 00:32:07,510
and one very interesting things

494
00:32:07,510 --> 00:32:10,980
testing data I heard that

495
00:32:10,980 --> 00:32:15,270
a lot of developers are not really it's
a happy when they're having

496
00:32:15,270 --> 00:32:18,280
analyzed information which means

497
00:32:18,280 --> 00:32:21,379
data which snot real on

498
00:32:21,380 --> 00:32:25,220
productive day to so they would like to
have direct access to the production to

499
00:32:25,220 --> 00:32:25,690
get

500
00:32:25,690 --> 00:32:29,230
real productive day to test not only
test data

501
00:32:29,230 --> 00:32:32,610
or when they're using test day there's
something goes wrong then protection

502
00:32:32,610 --> 00:32:33,420
they're saying

503
00:32:33,420 --> 00:32:37,360
complaining well we didn't have
pre-production detested

504
00:32:37,360 --> 00:32:40,740
maybe it's now possible to do that

505
00:32:40,740 --> 00:32:44,210
but you're still shipping over X
especially when the developers are

506
00:32:44,210 --> 00:32:45,140
sitting outside

507
00:32:45,140 --> 00:32:48,500
you're shooting shipping over on the
testator

508
00:32:48,500 --> 00:32:51,520
your protection anywhere else on

509
00:32:51,520 --> 00:32:55,410
deductions were interesting when they're
sitting offshore and onshore

510
00:32:55,410 --> 00:32:59,100
on virtual learning is quite interesting
sometimes it at

511
00:32:59,100 --> 00:33:02,300
don't have direct access when there were
using virtual environment

512
00:33:02,300 --> 00:33:06,530
Georgia property cover copyright expects
might be very interesting

513
00:33:06,530 --> 00:33:11,129
and I'm sometimes sup subcontract
respects are coming in which means

514
00:33:11,130 --> 00:33:15,130
that your offshoring and this person is
also offering

515
00:33:15,130 --> 00:33:18,320
for example you ask somebody get to do
something and

516
00:33:18,320 --> 00:33:21,918
there organizing developers which apply
cheaper than that and they're sold

517
00:33:21,919 --> 00:33:24,919
from Pottstown last but not least

518
00:33:24,919 --> 00:33:28,210
you don't know if you need a you want
every business and you have to think

519
00:33:28,210 --> 00:33:29,890
about what you really would like to talk

520
00:33:29,890 --> 00:33:34,150
cell we have to mitigate

521
00:33:34,150 --> 00:33:37,640
yes we have to know tourists yes that
only 10 minutes

522
00:33:37,640 --> 00:33:40,910
yes and first mitigation

523
00:33:40,910 --> 00:33:43,919
strategy 3g/3gs competent

524
00:33:43,919 --> 00:33:47,419
more of its on it's so important to
first

525
00:33:47,419 --> 00:33:50,650
think about what you really would like
to do you first think about

526
00:33:50,650 --> 00:33:54,520
would like to achieve what is thing what
you really would like to do concerning

527
00:33:54,520 --> 00:33:57,050
your business with you would like to do
with the IT

528
00:33:57,050 --> 00:34:00,690
what's the IT strategy behind and then
afterwards one issue really

529
00:34:00,690 --> 00:34:03,870
it. information strategy know what to
order

530
00:34:03,870 --> 00:34:08,310
not only do a handshake on the golf
course information security aspects

531
00:34:08,310 --> 00:34:11,179
classified as this also standards
nothing new

532
00:34:11,179 --> 00:34:14,590
classifying data classify information
workflow

533
00:34:14,590 --> 00:34:18,460
classifier business know what you really
have to know what you're really assets

534
00:34:18,460 --> 00:34:19,840
are known the holy grail

535
00:34:19,840 --> 00:34:23,590
then you can def describe what you
really access controls with you really

536
00:34:23,590 --> 00:34:24,060
need

537
00:34:24,060 --> 00:34:27,699
this is what I am mention with the fire
shadow thing

538
00:34:27,700 --> 00:34:31,919
when you know what you know with your
having and you know what you expect

539
00:34:31,918 --> 00:34:35,319
can directly very in DEP concrete

540
00:34:35,320 --> 00:34:38,330
describe what you want over think you
controls

541
00:34:38,330 --> 00:34:42,168
sometimes companies implement internal
control systems which are

542
00:34:42,168 --> 00:34:46,370
quite good and they have a lot of things
to cover

543
00:34:46,370 --> 00:34:51,199
but sometimes the to describe the
description of two controllers so

544
00:34:51,200 --> 00:34:56,600
let's say not detail the the evidence
which are created order

545
00:34:56,600 --> 00:35:00,180
not usable only for for teachers to say
well

546
00:35:00,180 --> 00:35:03,819
it's done but that's all

547
00:35:03,820 --> 00:35:07,250
or in compliance the same thing on think
about your

548
00:35:07,250 --> 00:35:10,640
security guidelines think about you
again

549
00:35:10,640 --> 00:35:13,600
think about what we would like to have
think about your strategies and then

550
00:35:13,600 --> 00:35:15,569
described security guidelines

551
00:35:15,570 --> 00:35:19,520
this security guard much feels a cover
on the old codices

552
00:35:19,520 --> 00:35:23,090
and DOTC should understand with you what
you need

553
00:35:23,090 --> 00:35:27,840
and should sign that of

554
00:35:27,840 --> 00:35:32,130
on defined as the wave incident handling
which is one of the biggest problem was

555
00:35:32,130 --> 00:35:35,630
one of the major problems switcher a

556
00:35:35,630 --> 00:35:39,180
which are happening the people having
incident management processes which are

557
00:35:39,180 --> 00:35:39,830
quite good

558
00:35:39,830 --> 00:35:44,690
but when something is happening with
your data you might for example get only

559
00:35:44,690 --> 00:35:48,830
once a month information about because
this is written in the policy or just

560
00:35:48,830 --> 00:35:52,799
threaten the contract

561
00:35:52,800 --> 00:35:56,810
it's quite easy on think about
segregating at work think about to

562
00:35:56,810 --> 00:35:57,500
congressional

563
00:35:57,500 --> 00:36:00,600
a duties define

564
00:36:00,600 --> 00:36:04,359
information flow and Exchange
possibilities and

565
00:36:04,359 --> 00:36:08,660
or think entries which means for example
working with consultancy company

566
00:36:08,660 --> 00:36:13,509
think about exchanging data securely

567
00:36:13,510 --> 00:36:17,750
long regulation on before you start and
before you really

568
00:36:17,750 --> 00:36:21,609
start think what you want against ready

569
00:36:21,609 --> 00:36:25,310
and that frightened request for proposal
and do security

570
00:36:25,310 --> 00:36:29,200
their not do you have let's say nice

571
00:36:29,200 --> 00:36:33,250
no well we do promise to do that later

572
00:36:33,250 --> 00:36:37,050
but it's not the Request for Proposal
when you're in security and you have to

573
00:36:37,050 --> 00:36:38,680
possibility to fellow

574
00:36:38,680 --> 00:36:41,810
and inject security in request for
proposal

575
00:36:41,810 --> 00:36:44,980
do it is quite important and

576
00:36:44,980 --> 00:36:47,990
everyone's and think about your sourcing
strategy which

577
00:36:47,990 --> 00:36:51,850
which leads directly your the
contractual

578
00:36:51,850 --> 00:36:55,390
loft complete outsourcing aspect

579
00:36:55,390 --> 00:36:58,900
when you'd like to buy and for example
development companies

580
00:36:58,900 --> 00:37:03,810
or smaller one or two men shells for
certain development switcher

581
00:37:03,810 --> 00:37:06,950
very specific describe the contract

582
00:37:06,950 --> 00:37:09,950
very concrete know what you would like
to have

583
00:37:09,950 --> 00:37:13,710
and the second thing is describe what
your sources strategy is for example

584
00:37:13,710 --> 00:37:17,380
is something's happening wrong you would
like to get rid of this

585
00:37:17,380 --> 00:37:23,609
you would like to get with this person
or the company or not

586
00:37:23,609 --> 00:37:26,930
a also which being you contract and

587
00:37:26,930 --> 00:37:31,500
which should not be negotiable is
intellectual property rights copyright

588
00:37:31,500 --> 00:37:35,780
copyrights lost acts DataPro protection
law

589
00:37:35,780 --> 00:37:39,570
for some potential on europe quite
strong compared to you

590
00:37:39,570 --> 00:37:43,430
to other regions penalty aspect if
something's happening Ron

591
00:37:43,430 --> 00:37:46,660
you should charge his persons

592
00:37:46,660 --> 00:37:50,839
development architectures same
virtualization it's quite interesting

593
00:37:50,839 --> 00:37:52,490
because a lot of companies were

594
00:37:52,490 --> 00:37:56,430
where she was Asian when you would like
to do that think about it before you

595
00:37:56,430 --> 00:37:57,540
realize that

596
00:37:57,540 --> 00:38:02,509
same look like right

597
00:38:02,510 --> 00:38:05,839
on who can help this is quite an
interesting stuff

598
00:38:05,839 --> 00:38:09,080
when you're thinking about doing the
outsourcing and think about well

599
00:38:09,080 --> 00:38:13,549
I'm not really and best position to
discuss her door knobs

600
00:38:13,550 --> 00:38:18,700
well I would like to buy somebody in to
organize me outsourcing

601
00:38:18,700 --> 00:38:22,690
why not do that I said well as a
possible nobody's offering that

602
00:38:22,690 --> 00:38:26,140
PT's there's I found one example of
company

603
00:38:26,140 --> 00:38:29,890
their of earning on outsourcing for
outsourcing

604
00:38:29,890 --> 00:38:33,230
I'm best is just too

605
00:38:33,230 --> 00:38:36,780
have a closer look at the answers I was
kinda service they offer and they do

606
00:38:36,780 --> 00:38:40,460
everything you don't have to think about

607
00:38:40,460 --> 00:38:43,510
this present position and deals

608
00:38:43,510 --> 00:38:47,320
old-world and plot was real world thing

609
00:38:47,320 --> 00:38:51,280
you have business or T which means it.
historically

610
00:38:51,280 --> 00:38:54,839
when your business dark your child
directly at fifty

611
00:38:54,839 --> 00:38:58,020
you new situation would be outsourcer
there

612
00:38:58,020 --> 00:39:01,060
and you're a tease to conduct the month
to month management so the business

613
00:39:01,060 --> 00:39:02,170
talking to it.

614
00:39:02,170 --> 00:39:05,820
dits the monitor is pushing that over to
the outsourcer

615
00:39:05,820 --> 00:39:10,680
for part whatever and this support
situation is quite interesting

616
00:39:10,680 --> 00:39:13,870
that your businesses or your IT

617
00:39:13,870 --> 00:39:17,040
'it's do something together with the
outsourcing services and outsourcing

618
00:39:17,040 --> 00:39:18,330
services directly

619
00:39:18,330 --> 00:39:22,650
the month managing the outsourcer I
think this helps really good

620
00:39:22,650 --> 00:39:26,380
on are things by the way remote services
are offered

621
00:39:26,380 --> 00:39:29,510
but nobody thinking about shutting them
down which means everybody saying

622
00:39:29,510 --> 00:39:35,359
will be pushing the over but nobody's
pushing that

623
00:39:35,359 --> 00:39:38,580
conclusion Lawson least strategy

624
00:39:38,580 --> 00:39:42,350
think about what you want think about
what you need think about which kind of

625
00:39:42,350 --> 00:39:45,770
missiles you have which what you
actually would like to

626
00:39:45,770 --> 00:39:49,460
contractual mines what you really would
like to do with it

627
00:39:49,460 --> 00:39:53,020
you know what the real looks like so
think about you would like to attend

628
00:39:53,020 --> 00:39:57,320
fire which means to you would like to
engage yourself in discussion with you

629
00:39:57,320 --> 00:39:59,120
know the city and

630
00:39:59,120 --> 00:40:03,100
think about what do we do shadows are
you would like to stay in the cave

631
00:40:03,100 --> 00:40:06,540
to be changed and except everything
which happens

632
00:40:06,540 --> 00:40:09,839
coming from the from the couple live
anywhere

633
00:40:09,839 --> 00:40:13,870
on order

634
00:40:13,870 --> 00:40:17,940
what you what you need ordered evidence
that you would like to have ordered

635
00:40:17,940 --> 00:40:21,790
sometimes concrete audits on site which
means when you're not

636
00:40:21,790 --> 00:40:25,430
trusting the person go over and cost

637
00:40:25,430 --> 00:40:29,210
look for it and be sure you're in the
right location

638
00:40:29,210 --> 00:40:32,450
for example you're flying over approach
to any

639
00:40:32,450 --> 00:40:36,540
country and ask your support /url could
you please show us around there

640
00:40:36,540 --> 00:40:40,029
shown you very shiny building which
looks great

641
00:40:40,030 --> 00:40:44,810
the logo is on the the company's house
the housing is great to security on site

642
00:40:44,810 --> 00:40:46,529
is great everything looks perfect

643
00:40:46,530 --> 00:40:50,370
everybody is dressed up for everybody so
shiny when you fly back to have

644
00:40:50,370 --> 00:40:55,870
let's say kinda weird feeling in your
stomach because it was too clean

645
00:40:55,870 --> 00:41:01,230
on maybe you should think over if you're
in the right environment

646
00:41:01,230 --> 00:41:04,250
on

647
00:41:04,250 --> 00:41:07,520
to stay the case you have to do some
efforts you have to do something and you

648
00:41:07,520 --> 00:41:09,920
have to think about it before

649
00:41:09,920 --> 00:41:13,210
and on you have to add to compare

650
00:41:13,210 --> 00:41:16,760
to do comprehensive and analyzes before
that not during that

651
00:41:16,760 --> 00:41:19,780
seen a lot of projects where on

652
00:41:19,780 --> 00:41:23,100
of sore offshoring it. partnering
outsourcing

653
00:41:23,100 --> 00:41:26,640
were happening and nobody thought about
before that

654
00:41:26,640 --> 00:41:32,910
a dark thought about starting with the
project because it came from senior

655
00:41:32,910 --> 00:41:36,100
I would like to thank you for your
interest like to you thanks for

656
00:41:36,100 --> 00:41:39,280
a keepsake organizational behavior
invitation and

657
00:41:39,280 --> 00:41:46,280
if you have any questions feel free

658
00:42:10,950 --> 00:42:17,950
it

659
00:42:26,680 --> 00:42:29,969
common order worst-case up

660
00:42:29,969 --> 00:42:36,969
0 and

661
00:42:40,630 --> 00:42:44,380
to worse K heard from

662
00:42:44,380 --> 00:42:48,359
was shipping over productive data by at
the live room service

663
00:42:48,359 --> 00:42:53,000
like whole school Parcel Service
whatever

664
00:42:53,000 --> 00:42:57,859
and to complete package complete bundle
of data

665
00:42:57,859 --> 00:43:02,210
store on a I think it was not

666
00:43:02,210 --> 00:43:06,540
German words between the not tapes on

667
00:43:06,540 --> 00:43:11,009
was lost away not encrypt it

668
00:43:11,010 --> 00:43:14,070
not nothing and everybody said well it's
not too

669
00:43:14,070 --> 00:43:17,540
good but well happens and

670
00:43:17,540 --> 00:43:22,590
have afterwards everybody said well it
was thought it was important because the

671
00:43:22,590 --> 00:43:25,710
developer would like would like to have
to have two to after productive

672
00:43:25,710 --> 00:43:28,580
environment would like to have a copy of
productive environment

673
00:43:28,580 --> 00:43:31,710
it was not too good on

674
00:43:31,710 --> 00:43:35,030
most common as I think a to by and

675
00:43:35,030 --> 00:43:38,170
developers because you don't gets

676
00:43:38,170 --> 00:43:43,420
the not knowledge on the market
sometimes for specific environments

677
00:43:43,420 --> 00:43:44,540
offer specific

678
00:43:44,540 --> 00:43:49,800
development but this for example Sapa
development when you having

679
00:43:49,800 --> 00:43:53,740
very good about programs they're not
working you company they're working for

680
00:43:53,740 --> 00:43:55,600
a consulting company because they're

681
00:43:55,600 --> 00:43:59,050
morning are you don't look twice what
you can pay so you

682
00:43:59,050 --> 00:44:02,220
by and for certain projects for example
have a programmer

683
00:44:02,220 --> 00:44:05,570
but he knows much more

684
00:44:05,570 --> 00:44:09,190
on SAP and everything about you know you
ever could no

685
00:44:09,190 --> 00:44:12,770
so what might happen as that he can up

686
00:44:12,770 --> 00:44:16,009
thinking of changing code or let's say

687
00:44:16,010 --> 00:44:19,760
think of the problems you have urals
rights model and SAP

688
00:44:19,760 --> 00:44:24,160
and might get and say this information

689
00:44:24,160 --> 00:44:27,890
left on the table at the competitive
side so

690
00:44:27,890 --> 00:44:32,170
this might be one of the let's say quite
critical and so

691
00:44:32,170 --> 00:44:39,170
interesting situation

692
00:44:49,530 --> 00:44:55,980
good think do
