1
00:00:00,630 --> 00:00:03,590
had also my name is terms to know and
I'm here to talk

2
00:00:03,590 --> 00:00:06,840
to you about GSM and how you can
advocate was very cheap

3
00:00:06,840 --> 00:00:11,250
problem so our start was a short
introduction about urges him so I can

4
00:00:11,250 --> 00:00:11,880
understand

5
00:00:11,880 --> 00:00:15,849
what I'm talking about dinner directly
to DM

6
00:00:15,849 --> 00:00:20,430
MZ detached unlike denial of service and
them to know you can implement a passive

7
00:00:20,430 --> 00:00:20,980
listening

8
00:00:20,980 --> 00:00:25,000
was a simple my phone some

9
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:28,480
she was about me I've background in
computer science

10
00:00:28,480 --> 00:00:32,780
hmm I'm generally interested in
everything in 11

11
00:00:32,780 --> 00:00:35,829
and I've been walking was just some for
about two years

12
00:00:35,829 --> 00:00:39,379
but more specifically the last year when
have been active in a

13
00:00:39,379 --> 00:00:43,638
open BS EN them BB so

14
00:00:43,639 --> 00:00:48,569
this was a surges in the talks looks
like at least plane 2g network

15
00:00:48,569 --> 00:00:52,679
voice only it's on the list you have to
move my station

16
00:00:52,679 --> 00:00:56,409
as it is unfortunate to make its over
the here them

17
00:00:56,409 --> 00:00:59,819
to what's called the BGS which is the
base transceiver station

18
00:00:59,819 --> 00:01:05,140
is really just a transceiver doesn't
have much logic into its

19
00:01:05,140 --> 00:01:09,760
and then a.m. BSC base station
controller control surreal BTS

20
00:01:09,760 --> 00:01:13,100
grouped into what's called location area

21
00:01:13,100 --> 00:01:17,300
its is just Surabhi yes group no
together

22
00:01:17,300 --> 00:01:20,550
and indeed miss you control suburbia see

23
00:01:20,550 --> 00:01:23,759
and gym instead we are interested in

24
00:01:23,760 --> 00:01:26,900
in -ism for the denial of service

25
00:01:26,900 --> 00:01:31,320
dumb will inject packets onto the air
interface and did

26
00:01:31,320 --> 00:01:34,990
they will do transparently up to the
embassy the a.m

27
00:01:34,990 --> 00:01:38,479
the beaches and the issue was just
transfer them was a interacting

28
00:01:38,480 --> 00:01:42,890
and them of course them to as the phones
in the vicinity

29
00:01:42,890 --> 00:01:46,250
will just listen to them their interface

30
00:01:46,250 --> 00:01:50,050
some is with the urge is simple to come

31
00:01:50,050 --> 00:01:53,340
mister groups like so I do you 1

32
00:01:53,340 --> 00:01:57,260
you have the what's called a physical
layer then at the data link layer

33
00:01:57,260 --> 00:02:01,290
which is called an EPDM but we won't
talk about decision

34
00:02:01,290 --> 00:02:04,490
and then finally the highest liberalism

35
00:02:04,490 --> 00:02:07,720
the a tree which implements or devise

36
00:02:07,720 --> 00:02:10,840
control some

37
00:02:10,840 --> 00:02:15,499
on the interface home it's played in
several bands as you probably know like

38
00:02:15,499 --> 00:02:18,030
GSM 900 and DCs and pieces

39
00:02:18,030 --> 00:02:21,659
things like that and each other's pins s
to serbians

40
00:02:21,659 --> 00:02:25,980
I would say one is reserved for
dunnington as more information going

41
00:02:25,980 --> 00:02:29,238
from the network to them by stations and
in

42
00:02:29,239 --> 00:02:32,819
hands have been to for a pink um

43
00:02:32,819 --> 00:02:36,719
everything sent by different wouldn't
walk annum

44
00:02:36,719 --> 00:02:39,920
what what's called an here if CNN is

45
00:02:39,920 --> 00:02:43,620
basically a pair of frequency one

46
00:02:43,620 --> 00:02:49,279
and a pink and one hundred only ok im

47
00:02:49,279 --> 00:02:53,799
on those we conceded the the information
is transmitted

48
00:02:53,799 --> 00:02:57,239
by bursts and now there are four main
types of birds but

49
00:02:57,239 --> 00:03:01,120
them three of them really for special
functions and only the

50
00:03:01,120 --> 00:03:04,299
what's called a normal burst transmit
really damn

51
00:03:04,299 --> 00:03:07,950
data and information is this what is
what we want

52
00:03:07,950 --> 00:03:13,279
those were some on the transmitted in

53
00:03:13,279 --> 00:03:17,709
transmit synchronously completely -ism
it's a footie jammies system

54
00:03:17,709 --> 00:03:21,480
nerves as some people described as a
nightmare because used like to Jimmy

55
00:03:21,480 --> 00:03:22,419
inside 2d-image

56
00:03:22,419 --> 00:03:27,069
is very complicated but for all purposes
what we need now is that one frame is

57
00:03:27,069 --> 00:03:31,079
eight times not and each time so
disappears and

58
00:03:31,079 --> 00:03:34,639
what's called a physical channel is one
times not on one possibly hundreds

59
00:03:34,639 --> 00:03:35,629
yessum

60
00:03:35,629 --> 00:03:41,189
one possible para frequency up to
neutrino

61
00:03:41,189 --> 00:03:44,388
was me it's been um

62
00:03:44,389 --> 00:03:49,010
it's a divided again Anna the lowest
layer which is called the

63
00:03:49,010 --> 00:03:52,409
review resumes management am um

64
00:03:52,409 --> 00:03:56,230
basically establishes point-to-point
connections and what we really want to

65
00:03:56,230 --> 00:03:57,120
know is like

66
00:03:57,120 --> 00:04:00,169
them the open era which is called mm

67
00:04:00,169 --> 00:04:04,639
for mobility management um this is what
will explode and

68
00:04:04,639 --> 00:04:09,239
exited that stretch and its main
function is basically to try to use 'em

69
00:04:09,239 --> 00:04:12,930
it tries to answer one simple question
which is okie I want to contact this

70
00:04:12,930 --> 00:04:13,499
user:

71
00:04:13,499 --> 00:04:17,860
what location area is that use a min it
also ensure like

72
00:04:17,860 --> 00:04:20,950
user id confidentiality

73
00:04:20,950 --> 00:04:26,000
things I did item to accomplish this
goal is used to mean procedures

74
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:29,480
what's called the location updates mmm
it

75
00:04:29,480 --> 00:04:33,340
dispositive issues in three separate
leases first when you Tony

76
00:04:33,340 --> 00:04:36,850
sonum you by phone like you login into
the network

77
00:04:36,850 --> 00:04:39,850
or when you change location areas

78
00:04:39,850 --> 00:04:42,970
as a key them so the network okay I
moved from

79
00:04:42,970 --> 00:04:47,240
dislocation arena to that was in the
kitchen area warm

80
00:04:47,240 --> 00:04:50,390
what's called a periodic updates doesn't
leave with a

81
00:04:50,390 --> 00:04:55,490
on was not only reason I'd say you your
network your phone will just come pick

82
00:04:55,490 --> 00:04:56,740
to be just as a rookie

83
00:04:56,740 --> 00:04:59,800
I'm still here um the other procedures

84
00:04:59,800 --> 00:05:04,370
in detention tests the does it a lot of
of the network sing to the network okay

85
00:05:04,370 --> 00:05:05,660
I'm turning off my phone

86
00:05:05,660 --> 00:05:10,560
them don't try to come pick me anymore
ok im

87
00:05:10,560 --> 00:05:17,140
so denial of service itself muskie
procedures in a talk Tom

88
00:05:17,140 --> 00:05:21,000
will be authenticated and cited you know
you re a little bit least

89
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:24,980
the example in the leftist location
updates for example and you see

90
00:05:24,980 --> 00:05:26,070
the

91
00:05:26,070 --> 00:05:30,120
first appears like them establishment of
a point to point connection

92
00:05:30,120 --> 00:05:34,910
then you the phone requests location
update and then it will go to Kate's

93
00:05:34,910 --> 00:05:40,150
start ciphering and then proceeds into
effectively doing the location update

94
00:05:40,150 --> 00:05:45,030
than the journalists release the brain
wasn't attached to the

95
00:05:45,030 --> 00:05:47,760
position doesn't alone for ciphering

96
00:05:47,760 --> 00:05:51,570
it wasn't occasion and at this stage so
you just open a channel

97
00:05:51,570 --> 00:05:55,490
you say okay look me up the network he
was mayor my identity

98
00:05:55,490 --> 00:05:59,100
and you automatically logged off with an
agenda verifications

99
00:05:59,100 --> 00:06:03,880
and of course that's can have a problem
so I do exploited

100
00:06:03,880 --> 00:06:07,159
was pretty easy just open channel send

101
00:06:07,160 --> 00:06:10,720
names detached occasion message was dumb

102
00:06:10,720 --> 00:06:15,540
the MZ which is the like to see %uh the
CNN building

103
00:06:15,540 --> 00:06:19,690
the subprime that you want to look at
the network in

104
00:06:19,690 --> 00:06:22,740
a year ago that would have been pretty
hot you

105
00:06:22,740 --> 00:06:26,060
but was as we can be no Dom within just

106
00:06:26,060 --> 00:06:29,460
take to the dr one and im

107
00:06:29,460 --> 00:06:33,230
implement implemented in on a simple by
phone and

108
00:06:33,230 --> 00:06:36,370
and send a message its re really easy to
do

109
00:06:36,370 --> 00:06:39,800
um I'm committed

110
00:06:39,800 --> 00:06:43,140
it tonight 15 minutes yesterday at

111
00:06:43,140 --> 00:06:47,680
looks just great so what does it do
exactly

112
00:06:47,680 --> 00:06:51,740
in the in the network some the ames's
education will be sent up to the embassy

113
00:06:51,740 --> 00:06:56,000
and Missy will mark that subscriber

114
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:59,270
home as detached what this means

115
00:06:59,270 --> 00:07:03,359
is form a bond summitted services that
is if you're trying

116
00:07:03,360 --> 00:07:06,570
if if you're trying to call the targets
dumb

117
00:07:06,570 --> 00:07:10,870
you would get a message like a pinata
this user is outside the coverage area

118
00:07:10,870 --> 00:07:14,060
something like that because for for the
network

119
00:07:14,060 --> 00:07:18,680
this user isn't connected some for the
user and such

120
00:07:18,680 --> 00:07:22,120
she tries to please call it will watch
videos some

121
00:07:22,120 --> 00:07:25,600
he was in the message body I want to
call that number and it will

122
00:07:25,600 --> 00:07:28,700
respond okay but you're not logged in so
please login to listen

123
00:07:28,700 --> 00:07:32,090
he was in Reno in and the call we
proceeded with just

124
00:07:32,090 --> 00:07:36,010
some take a while longer because you
have to do much more

125
00:07:36,010 --> 00:07:40,580
Tom the spigot says that

126
00:07:40,580 --> 00:07:44,320
in theory diplomacy should a.m.

127
00:07:44,320 --> 00:07:48,409
again should determine its own mm
connections days

128
00:07:48,410 --> 00:07:51,780
if the current connection is currently
active it should shoulda done

129
00:07:51,780 --> 00:07:52,610
immediately

130
00:07:52,610 --> 00:07:56,700
this is depends on the network some

131
00:07:56,700 --> 00:08:00,250
on my home network a in like in Belgium
dats what it does

132
00:08:00,250 --> 00:08:03,710
if I sometimes it that's why I'm unicorn
the connections like

133
00:08:03,710 --> 00:08:07,600
occurred instantly even t-mobile edges
does not think so

134
00:08:07,600 --> 00:08:10,880
probably depends on the network um

135
00:08:10,880 --> 00:08:15,100
an interesting side effect of the fact
that the you created you force

136
00:08:15,100 --> 00:08:20,770
a new location update requests is that's
it can help you uncover ordered the

137
00:08:20,770 --> 00:08:22,520
relation between the Indian the DMZ

138
00:08:22,520 --> 00:08:25,560
so basically when you look into the net
world the

139
00:08:25,560 --> 00:08:30,070
to try to I do identity the net will
give you a temporary

140
00:08:30,070 --> 00:08:33,679
ID which is only valid in that
particular location area

141
00:08:33,680 --> 00:08:37,120
and thats has what's supposed to ensure
confidentiality

142
00:08:37,120 --> 00:08:40,320
but since you can force to the
renegotiation

143
00:08:40,320 --> 00:08:44,210
you can actually and covered in the
relation between the two and also since

144
00:08:44,210 --> 00:08:47,120
you create more control traffic that's
that's good because

145
00:08:47,120 --> 00:08:50,920
um but eastman good for an attack you um

146
00:08:50,920 --> 00:08:54,439
because come from traffic mean lots of
known plaintext which

147
00:08:54,440 --> 00:08:58,670
is but if you want to bring decide from
key and thus a frumpy would probably be

148
00:08:58,670 --> 00:08:59,689
the same

149
00:08:59,690 --> 00:09:02,890
for the subsea convoys cool so you don't
even have to protect him

150
00:09:02,890 --> 00:09:07,240
um do Brasil cam

151
00:09:07,240 --> 00:09:10,910
tradition pretty easily against death
because in detention is an optional

152
00:09:10,910 --> 00:09:11,469
procedures

153
00:09:11,470 --> 00:09:15,540
what I mean option is that the network
can use 'em you on ups

154
00:09:15,540 --> 00:09:18,910
job so supply just don't use it

155
00:09:18,910 --> 00:09:23,550
of course um you have to make sure that
if you don't use it you actually

156
00:09:23,550 --> 00:09:27,200
nor all incoming MZ touch indication as
its just who's this

157
00:09:27,200 --> 00:09:30,670
um it's not free

158
00:09:30,670 --> 00:09:33,849
because basically if a user logs of you
don't know

159
00:09:33,850 --> 00:09:37,920
com that is not a minute walk so you
will try to contact him for nothing

160
00:09:37,920 --> 00:09:42,040
um to try to track the user you can like
used

161
00:09:42,040 --> 00:09:45,699
the pill you teacher location update
that is you for the phone to

162
00:09:45,700 --> 00:09:46,690
periodically

163
00:09:46,690 --> 00:09:50,400
being the network um the discoms as a
cost as well

164
00:09:50,400 --> 00:09:54,569
since you will the phone with you some
some control channel for for some time

165
00:09:54,570 --> 00:09:56,180
so it's basically a trade-off between

166
00:09:56,180 --> 00:10:00,910
use this page in traffic jam most use
this occasion a beating because traffic

167
00:10:00,910 --> 00:10:05,550
so that that shows you can do anderson's

168
00:10:05,550 --> 00:10:08,790
something else you can do -ism

169
00:10:08,790 --> 00:10:11,949
just refusing coming in detach

170
00:10:11,950 --> 00:10:15,410
them whether the identity specified by
MZ

171
00:10:15,410 --> 00:10:19,240
so in in the exited detention indication
message

172
00:10:19,240 --> 00:10:22,780
you can't you detach a specific MZ for a
specific team Z

173
00:10:22,780 --> 00:10:26,030
so do it is a with the back to

174
00:10:26,030 --> 00:10:30,920
the identity done the global identity of
the subscriber nor the

175
00:10:30,920 --> 00:10:35,880
towards temporary identity sins is
loading onto the network he has a teensy

176
00:10:35,880 --> 00:10:40,400
so you should only except incoming exit
hatch

177
00:10:40,400 --> 00:10:43,520
when this but if i'd by Tim C and all
forms a scene

178
00:10:43,520 --> 00:10:47,610
uses the team's economy an attacker
would use the agency hmm

179
00:10:47,610 --> 00:10:52,160
it's not a solution but pleased chance
to make the target part a little harder

180
00:10:52,160 --> 00:10:55,410
so

181
00:10:55,410 --> 00:10:58,610
but if it is doom so 100

182
00:10:58,610 --> 00:11:02,260
thats um

183
00:11:02,260 --> 00:11:05,310
actually mostly I'm actually a.m.

184
00:11:05,310 --> 00:11:09,010
BTS here slave like you know

185
00:11:09,010 --> 00:11:14,210
a test his mettle running were
disconnected several phones

186
00:11:14,210 --> 00:11:18,350
so if a poor on this phone's this from

187
00:11:18,350 --> 00:11:21,600
she cannibalism

188
00:11:21,600 --> 00:11:24,920
okay you see that you registered undone

189
00:11:24,920 --> 00:11:28,219
on the network come

190
00:11:28,220 --> 00:11:32,950
yeah

191
00:11:32,950 --> 00:11:37,050
yes im against some I tried to call in
right now

192
00:11:37,050 --> 00:11:41,460
it should be just fine hopefully

193
00:11:41,460 --> 00:11:45,180
Canada's so that's kinda

194
00:11:45,180 --> 00:11:48,920
expected the ATM no

195
00:11:48,920 --> 00:11:52,079
I'm gonna use them an effective phone
here

196
00:11:52,080 --> 00:11:56,700
to transmit an exit hatch message that
that will a.m.

197
00:11:56,700 --> 00:12:00,040
look i've this poem from the net watch
so

198
00:12:00,040 --> 00:12:04,520
what is unjust times dance

199
00:12:04,520 --> 00:12:09,360
so here unloading the gym where the
modified chairman this from

200
00:12:09,360 --> 00:12:15,310
in putting the gym

201
00:12:15,310 --> 00:12:18,400
in here and actually transferred the
packets that

202
00:12:18,400 --> 00:12:22,800
going to touch the phone yeah hun

203
00:12:22,800 --> 00:12:25,930
its concerns says as you can see the BTS

204
00:12:25,930 --> 00:12:29,840
a.m. put him in screen some

205
00:12:29,840 --> 00:12:33,480
here is received and attach and if I try
to call you

206
00:12:33,480 --> 00:12:36,840
dust when again it should just

207
00:12:36,840 --> 00:12:41,050
not work and it doesn't call failed

208
00:12:41,050 --> 00:12:44,170
just officially for the network that
phone

209
00:12:44,170 --> 00:12:48,370
its no longer on the network some

210
00:12:48,370 --> 00:12:53,250
symington of now

211
00:12:53,250 --> 00:13:00,250
you something

212
00:13:11,790 --> 00:13:15,610
game so no um

213
00:13:15,610 --> 00:13:18,730
we're gonna talk about

214
00:13:18,730 --> 00:13:22,360
are you can use the same hardware so
still dismayed by phone

215
00:13:22,360 --> 00:13:27,399
comes to use a pacifism so first what do
I mean by passive is no what why what's

216
00:13:27,399 --> 00:13:30,430
on I want the rumors datum that is

217
00:13:30,430 --> 00:13:33,850
um has his own into being the last four
times the Blessed One

218
00:13:33,850 --> 00:13:37,120
the normal births and I want those bits
exactly and

219
00:13:37,120 --> 00:13:41,440
not be processed or anything because if
you want to print a 50 2 a.m.

220
00:13:41,440 --> 00:13:46,200
other things you really need that with
the time preferably I'd like the opening

221
00:13:46,200 --> 00:13:50,290
and only inge because I've points better
and the

222
00:13:50,290 --> 00:13:54,529
some frequency hopping support of course
because that is really used on

223
00:13:54,529 --> 00:13:59,579
in real networks sorry 31 support for
its the target other is basically what

224
00:13:59,579 --> 00:14:01,100
those macum BB supports

225
00:14:01,100 --> 00:14:04,649
dumb disease %um using a tour issue 12

226
00:14:04,649 --> 00:14:08,260
C 120 treatment on there are a lot of Oz
modems

227
00:14:08,260 --> 00:14:11,550
dumb they were chosen because it's a
super

228
00:14:11,550 --> 00:14:15,720
it's a classic J Phillips a design that
means its first day was sleep

229
00:14:15,720 --> 00:14:18,190
documentation so we're not completely
blind

230
00:14:18,190 --> 00:14:23,709
and dumb dollars have funds available
for it and if or very cheap like

231
00:14:23,709 --> 00:14:27,000
you know twenty your room you and you
can find them

232
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:32,089
like when you're away you can wait up

233
00:14:32,089 --> 00:14:38,610
why would you want to do them welcome
debugging Jizan project thank you for

234
00:14:38,610 --> 00:14:39,770
sure implemented

235
00:14:39,770 --> 00:14:44,329
home things I E VDSL

236
00:14:44,329 --> 00:14:47,829
asthma can be trying to implement new
features up its

237
00:14:47,829 --> 00:14:50,930
always really useful to know what's
exactly on the air

238
00:14:50,930 --> 00:14:54,970
because you can buy just equipment that
does that but it is very expensive

239
00:14:54,970 --> 00:14:58,170
and being able to do it now when I can
20 euro

240
00:14:58,170 --> 00:15:03,000
would be a.m. really nice is best for
you a cheap used to be

241
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:06,160
it's kinda different but um

242
00:15:06,160 --> 00:15:10,189
the ID is the same just some adventures
of course it's much cheaper because he

243
00:15:10,190 --> 00:15:12,250
is a piece like seven the new room Press

244
00:15:12,250 --> 00:15:15,339
chipping in and stuff I am it would have

245
00:15:15,339 --> 00:15:18,519
hoping an open support which Apple
doesn't support

246
00:15:18,519 --> 00:15:21,540
was published random

247
00:15:21,540 --> 00:15:25,500
some or some it's much more portable
mini

248
00:15:25,500 --> 00:15:28,930
I have this always in my bag I don't
have me as a bee on all the time

249
00:15:28,930 --> 00:15:32,470
with me of course it's its gonna limited
because

250
00:15:32,470 --> 00:15:36,399
'em did you do use to be used as a few
wideband

251
00:15:36,399 --> 00:15:41,040
moms have to define transceiver you can
do much more than than when the phone

252
00:15:41,040 --> 00:15:42,709
does but the problem is so so much

253
00:15:42,709 --> 00:15:46,050
others could because you visited could
everything yourself

254
00:15:46,050 --> 00:15:50,829
some for example what's currently caught
in a probe

255
00:15:50,829 --> 00:15:55,209
in particular the gym with you later on
it works but it doesn't work as well as

256
00:15:55,209 --> 00:15:57,750
like the commercial demanded that you
would find in

257
00:15:57,750 --> 00:16:02,110
in this point it has been up too much
from many years in it works very well

258
00:16:02,110 --> 00:16:07,300
swingin' on everything related to you
GSM

259
00:16:07,300 --> 00:16:13,029
could use you know achieved from so

260
00:16:13,029 --> 00:16:16,400
this is what the the reception pasa for

261
00:16:16,400 --> 00:16:20,500
up this one looks like its was a a
little simplified but that's the idea

262
00:16:20,500 --> 00:16:25,080
each element's hmm with a go through
each element and see

263
00:16:25,080 --> 00:16:29,610
Candice element do what I wanted to do
is it an obstacle

264
00:16:29,610 --> 00:16:33,470
and if it's an obstacle is there someone
to walk around it all

265
00:16:33,470 --> 00:16:39,330
more or change it or whatever the
president is multi-antenna

266
00:16:39,330 --> 00:16:44,300
its completely and remarking it's it's
like a zero dB gain its

267
00:16:44,300 --> 00:16:47,760
its its ohkay just four games only

268
00:16:47,760 --> 00:16:50,710
it's ok if you want to receive the base
station because the base station

269
00:16:50,710 --> 00:16:53,850
transmits was a lot of power it's it's
also a home

270
00:16:53,850 --> 00:16:58,490
you know I'm please very high above the
ground is great antenna so

271
00:16:58,490 --> 00:17:01,930
receiving it is really not a problem on
the other hand if you're trying to

272
00:17:01,930 --> 00:17:03,870
receive the films themselves

273
00:17:03,870 --> 00:17:07,690
up they also have plans to now the the
only transmit like 11

274
00:17:07,690 --> 00:17:09,520
maximum

275
00:17:09,520 --> 00:17:13,970
some and that's only if the the beaches
and tell him to transmit less power

276
00:17:13,970 --> 00:17:18,339
and also that day like at ground level
receiving them is is much harder

277
00:17:18,339 --> 00:17:22,780
to try to to work on that you can either
use like an external antenna

278
00:17:22,780 --> 00:17:27,349
or just pre amplify the signal

279
00:17:27,349 --> 00:17:31,429
was a was earth preamplifier you have to
be careful to

280
00:17:31,430 --> 00:17:34,450
betos a.m. issue impeach since

281
00:17:34,450 --> 00:17:38,320
you amplify Orleans and I will have to
find everything you can such a reading

282
00:17:38,320 --> 00:17:39,570
input stage at the phone

283
00:17:39,570 --> 00:17:45,550
and and you on receive anything it the
second element is dumb

284
00:17:45,550 --> 00:17:48,860
reception phantom now looking to improve
the

285
00:17:48,860 --> 00:17:52,210
home the quality of the distinguished

286
00:17:52,210 --> 00:17:55,540
received by the film's the metric to put
a filters into

287
00:17:55,540 --> 00:17:59,330
that fizzles out everything that's not
in the band that the phone is supposed

288
00:17:59,330 --> 00:18:00,260
to listen to him

289
00:18:00,260 --> 00:18:04,860
which is good grade because it protects
against all kinds of interference

290
00:18:04,860 --> 00:18:08,300
delivered that's for us because if you
want to receive

291
00:18:08,300 --> 00:18:11,409
Appling dancing and is gonna be
attenuated

292
00:18:11,410 --> 00:18:15,740
by something like 30 40 DB so you
haven't already weak signal

293
00:18:15,740 --> 00:18:19,470
you're cooking for TV audience um
there's nothing left

294
00:18:19,470 --> 00:18:23,600
them sold what can you do about dad

295
00:18:23,600 --> 00:18:27,870
whether you just don't care about to
plunge mom that's an option

296
00:18:27,870 --> 00:18:31,240
someone to function um dementia subtle

297
00:18:31,240 --> 00:18:34,930
lab testing only because in a lab I mean
if you all doing one

298
00:18:34,930 --> 00:18:38,140
the transceiver phone in one hand and a
super fun and learn and

299
00:18:38,140 --> 00:18:41,380
its gonna will find in like one min to
report the season is gonna be strong

300
00:18:41,380 --> 00:18:41,860
enough

301
00:18:41,860 --> 00:18:45,270
butter if you like your a hundred meters
away

302
00:18:45,270 --> 00:18:49,620
dead that's not gonna warn so the only
real option is to remove its

303
00:18:49,620 --> 00:18:52,740
home was given only because it's other
modification but

304
00:18:52,740 --> 00:18:56,160
no it's it's still better to do no

305
00:18:56,160 --> 00:18:59,370
people complication do um the filter

306
00:18:59,370 --> 00:19:03,420
this more than just to do it also
converts what's called unbalanced signal

307
00:19:03,420 --> 00:19:06,940
into a balanced signals about it is a
single in the two different from

308
00:19:06,940 --> 00:19:11,340
some you can just technicians are out
and put us on the bridge in its place

309
00:19:11,340 --> 00:19:14,010
you actually have to replace it by in
the components

310
00:19:14,010 --> 00:19:17,440
um and those components alike you know

311
00:19:17,440 --> 00:19:21,040
two millimeters by one millimeter ans

312
00:19:21,040 --> 00:19:24,389
but you can do it hmm and other problems

313
00:19:24,390 --> 00:19:27,970
bias voltage difference visited the
input signal is like reference to the

314
00:19:27,970 --> 00:19:28,540
ground

315
00:19:28,540 --> 00:19:32,149
and the output signal is reference to us
some internal reference

316
00:19:32,150 --> 00:19:35,840
the preamplifier so you have to make
sure you use them

317
00:19:35,840 --> 00:19:39,230
capacitors in the past which again I Q
no

318
00:19:39,230 --> 00:19:45,060
will 402 thats very small but it most

319
00:19:45,060 --> 00:19:50,270
um just adapt you find

320
00:19:50,270 --> 00:19:54,030
mixer the mixers doesn't need it sooner
the film

321
00:19:54,030 --> 00:19:57,370
um it can obviously to in anywhere in

322
00:19:57,370 --> 00:20:00,690
and the dawning band that the phone
supports so even if needed

323
00:20:00,690 --> 00:20:04,160
country even more than and when the
phones pose because the chips that it

324
00:20:04,160 --> 00:20:05,210
sensible thing if

325
00:20:05,210 --> 00:20:09,250
850 900 1819 100 even ish

326
00:20:09,250 --> 00:20:12,780
officially to the supposed like to the
that you know we actually

327
00:20:12,780 --> 00:20:16,030
support order bans but

328
00:20:16,030 --> 00:20:19,639
it on doesn't support tuning in to the
public because the real for never has to

329
00:20:19,640 --> 00:20:20,160
do that

330
00:20:20,160 --> 00:20:23,520
Tom that was kind of a problem

331
00:20:23,520 --> 00:20:26,530
so we just tried it we

332
00:20:26,530 --> 00:20:29,950
to perform in the data sheet hold to
compute the

333
00:20:29,950 --> 00:20:33,600
the piano configuration values and we
applied them for the

334
00:20:33,600 --> 00:20:37,340
a pin frequencies and we know the deaths
and them

335
00:20:37,340 --> 00:20:42,030
just up in two words: of course the it's
also the specs of the chapters that

336
00:20:42,030 --> 00:20:43,320
might be a little

337
00:20:43,320 --> 00:20:46,970
in Britain is good

338
00:20:46,970 --> 00:20:51,090
it walks in that's the main point so
which is

339
00:20:51,090 --> 00:20:54,340
removed to check into code that the
checks if it's

340
00:20:54,340 --> 00:20:57,340
inside a specific Asian just know that
the values

341
00:20:57,340 --> 00:21:00,879
Sony Ericsson outputs

342
00:21:00,880 --> 00:21:05,820
a.m. analog IQ signals quite a few
signals

343
00:21:05,820 --> 00:21:09,500
into the envelope is burned you know
business just to

344
00:21:09,500 --> 00:21:13,030
best Kennedy seat covers the analog
signal into

345
00:21:13,030 --> 00:21:16,520
digital some post that can be data
processed um

346
00:21:16,520 --> 00:21:20,720
it doesn't really pose a problem for us

347
00:21:20,720 --> 00:21:23,750
the the only problem currently is the
driver for its

348
00:21:23,750 --> 00:21:27,180
is some despite limited because you
configure

349
00:21:27,180 --> 00:21:32,300
a.m. you configure it to receive like a
160 samper's

350
00:21:32,300 --> 00:21:36,000
cities one burst and you have to
configure it for each

351
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:41,190
group of 160 samples and currently the
drivers that doesn't lol to

352
00:21:41,190 --> 00:21:45,980
contribute to consecutive burst so

353
00:21:45,980 --> 00:21:49,930
that's it that's an imitation but that's
a soft when imitation

354
00:21:49,930 --> 00:21:53,940
because the other has to be able to do
it since its

355
00:21:53,940 --> 00:21:57,440
requirement for GPRS but it's not and
and this chip

356
00:21:57,440 --> 00:22:00,560
he supposed to support at least two two
consecutive

357
00:22:00,560 --> 00:22:03,790
burst so did

358
00:22:03,790 --> 00:22:06,790
was another walk we we could just lift
that restriction

359
00:22:06,790 --> 00:22:11,070
K

360
00:22:11,070 --> 00:22:14,070
okay the next step the

361
00:22:14,070 --> 00:22:17,639
the DS the inside the digital baseband
which is like the

362
00:22:17,640 --> 00:22:20,640
the biggest shipbuilder on the phone um

363
00:22:20,640 --> 00:22:24,070
wrist to serve chips the the TSP the
produ

364
00:22:24,070 --> 00:22:28,419
ordered imagination and things like that

365
00:22:28,420 --> 00:22:33,160
and the arm so that this piece from base
that is

366
00:22:33,160 --> 00:22:36,960
there is a few more its a.m. odd reason
we can we count changes

367
00:22:36,960 --> 00:22:40,240
what we can do or whatever it is is like
a price more patches

368
00:22:40,240 --> 00:22:44,190
because demand for Twitter didn't want
to we burn a new chip each time

369
00:22:44,190 --> 00:22:48,460
so there is a small area of RAM where
you can a.m. overwrites more part of the

370
00:22:48,460 --> 00:22:49,110
Rome

371
00:22:49,110 --> 00:22:53,790
instance old that use like function
tabor sent so you can overwrite

372
00:22:53,790 --> 00:22:57,540
entries in in the function tapers if you
want to call you function said that the

373
00:22:57,540 --> 00:22:59,470
default function

374
00:22:59,470 --> 00:23:02,630
I am in theory 2 TSP

375
00:23:02,630 --> 00:23:05,960
never gives you the real burst yeah I
mean the the beats

376
00:23:05,960 --> 00:23:09,910
the team admitted bits it it keeps them
and that it will apply

377
00:23:09,910 --> 00:23:15,490
like a a deciphering universe a row
correction

378
00:23:15,490 --> 00:23:18,930
more conventional coating all data is
supplied inside the ESPN

379
00:23:18,930 --> 00:23:25,340
what the DSP outputs is like a a full
day or two packets

380
00:23:25,340 --> 00:23:28,560
inches of control channel in full force
and Unitech re

381
00:23:28,560 --> 00:23:32,560
decompress the voice data inside the DSP
and sends them to

382
00:23:32,560 --> 00:23:37,540
to do. you could it directly so in
theory you're not supposed to

383
00:23:37,540 --> 00:23:41,680
to get the robbers so you have to
captured

384
00:23:41,680 --> 00:23:45,550
'em person who spoke up

385
00:23:45,550 --> 00:23:49,270
simple kinda uses them their own

386
00:23:49,270 --> 00:23:52,710
which is in theory impossible in its

387
00:23:52,710 --> 00:23:56,930
into it could be protected but you can
walk around a unfunny you reverse

388
00:23:56,930 --> 00:23:58,790
engineer it so you know

389
00:23:58,790 --> 00:24:01,928
other room works I

390
00:24:01,929 --> 00:24:04,190
of media supported so after like

391
00:24:04,190 --> 00:24:08,350
long our staring at the assembly of a of
the DSP

392
00:24:08,350 --> 00:24:11,669
you can figure out how it works and the
in dendrites

393
00:24:11,669 --> 00:24:15,519
custom task for the DSP that will do
what what you want is

394
00:24:15,519 --> 00:24:19,200
get the samples from the Adobe is burned

395
00:24:19,200 --> 00:24:22,330
applied the imagination and incense the

396
00:24:22,330 --> 00:24:26,168
the road in with the modded first comes
to the arm

397
00:24:26,169 --> 00:24:29,510
without any further processing in a

398
00:24:29,510 --> 00:24:33,180
did something that will help long time
but it's finally done

399
00:24:33,180 --> 00:24:37,450
its that's your than you have to

400
00:24:37,450 --> 00:24:41,320
um processo arm us with the BBC's

401
00:24:41,320 --> 00:24:45,110
us drivers for almost everything in the
arm that we need at least

402
00:24:45,110 --> 00:24:50,670
the it can drive DVD Adobe's band and do
and the mixer and everything

403
00:24:50,670 --> 00:24:54,480
a it also has order logic for says
selection

404
00:24:54,480 --> 00:24:58,100
saddam synchronization and what's what's

405
00:24:58,100 --> 00:25:02,180
story dirty miss Cora that is skidding
events at

406
00:25:02,180 --> 00:25:06,590
on popular frames and the GSM network

407
00:25:06,590 --> 00:25:10,260
daughter few things we need to change is

408
00:25:10,260 --> 00:25:13,350
home first we need to prejudice Pierre
at the booth

409
00:25:13,350 --> 00:25:17,250
said it's kinda abuse I am finally we
need

410
00:25:17,250 --> 00:25:20,770
we need a driver for the the new test
that we added

411
00:25:20,770 --> 00:25:25,500
2 tsp salt is not supported the main
night code so we had to write a driver

412
00:25:25,500 --> 00:25:25,790
that

413
00:25:25,790 --> 00:25:31,190
does 2/2 program DSP to use these new
command and received a row burst

414
00:25:31,190 --> 00:25:35,400
and finally we never want to transmit
anything but instead

415
00:25:35,400 --> 00:25:38,520
if we wait who wanted instead of
transmitting sorry

416
00:25:38,520 --> 00:25:42,850
we want to receive but instead receiving
them the only frequency want to listen

417
00:25:42,850 --> 00:25:43,300
to do

418
00:25:43,300 --> 00:25:46,880
a pre frequencies so home dog

419
00:25:46,880 --> 00:25:50,760
the changes in Dom code trip pretty
simple

420
00:25:50,760 --> 00:25:54,610
Tom sure familia was the last macum BBDO

421
00:25:54,610 --> 00:26:01,610
code Jose yep

422
00:26:02,140 --> 00:26:05,910
finally we have to get the data out
somehow

423
00:26:05,910 --> 00:26:11,350
from also can be used as a serial port

424
00:26:11,350 --> 00:26:15,120
which is did notice it's very simple
however

425
00:26:15,120 --> 00:26:19,360
150 into a boat it's just not fast
enough if you want to receive like

426
00:26:19,360 --> 00:26:23,030
to bidirectional foes channel

427
00:26:23,030 --> 00:26:26,770
you have to receive text for burst a.m.
a fun in 16

428
00:26:26,770 --> 00:26:30,090
bits and which transmits of bits
minotaur decision so

429
00:26:30,090 --> 00:26:33,300
on it's another panelist

430
00:26:33,300 --> 00:26:36,900
not little problem we can just

431
00:26:36,900 --> 00:26:39,970
increase the boat with the the only
complication is that the

432
00:26:39,970 --> 00:26:43,480
the stand-up cable that everyone uses
based around like the PL

433
00:26:43,480 --> 00:26:46,610
20 something home

434
00:26:46,610 --> 00:26:50,580
USB UHCI controller and that control
doesn't support

435
00:26:50,580 --> 00:26:55,110
non-standard portrayed so we have to use
the FTDI once

436
00:26:55,110 --> 00:26:58,920
it's likely this practical because it
looks like dad

437
00:26:58,920 --> 00:27:02,540
yeah now it's too

438
00:27:02,540 --> 00:27:06,490
to reach even the advantages we get like
four see our ports in in one board so we

439
00:27:06,490 --> 00:27:06,870
can

440
00:27:06,870 --> 00:27:12,450
control for forms upon supreme wanted to
on

441
00:27:12,450 --> 00:27:19,450
game damn show you what it looks like
said

442
00:27:33,260 --> 00:27:40,260
skim this

443
00:27:45,910 --> 00:27:48,940
it what I'm gonna do is something to
place a phone call from

444
00:27:48,940 --> 00:27:53,480
like it's a disco in to this phone and

445
00:27:53,480 --> 00:27:57,640
using the stiffer phone I'm gonna record
Appling and earning above

446
00:27:57,640 --> 00:28:01,190
this one of course I would have to say
to the compositions members into balls

447
00:28:01,190 --> 00:28:05,040
opening and link a.m. once so I'm

448
00:28:05,040 --> 00:28:11,550
loading my modified him on inside the
phone with the stiffer application does

449
00:28:11,550 --> 00:28:12,879
is it listens to the

450
00:28:12,880 --> 00:28:17,040
assignment China what the dissenters
okay do go to that the ticket a

451
00:28:17,040 --> 00:28:17,810
challenge and

452
00:28:17,810 --> 00:28:21,970
switches to the first time and fines
listen to it and open to there's nothing

453
00:28:21,970 --> 00:28:23,090
left to listen to

454
00:28:23,090 --> 00:28:30,090
okay

455
00:28:35,490 --> 00:28:38,420
yeah okay saddam here i'm talking

456
00:28:38,420 --> 00:28:41,690
into the core the form that's making the
call so

457
00:28:41,690 --> 00:28:44,760
I will hear this voice on to the opening
child

458
00:28:44,760 --> 00:28:47,920
if i'm talking them to do receive a
phone actually here

459
00:28:47,920 --> 00:28:52,720
what I'm saying doing channel this phone
since this one is receiving it

460
00:28:52,720 --> 00:28:58,440
from the network Richardson

461
00:28:58,440 --> 00:29:05,440
and

462
00:29:13,029 --> 00:29:15,830
okay so what justification did is

463
00:29:15,830 --> 00:29:20,220
save the onto the times had a fine that
contains all the birds that have been

464
00:29:20,220 --> 00:29:20,919
recorded

465
00:29:20,919 --> 00:29:24,529
them going to take dat and ticket

466
00:29:24,529 --> 00:29:28,650
through a program that will take the
burst and extract the voice data from

467
00:29:28,650 --> 00:29:29,070
them

468
00:29:29,070 --> 00:29:32,570
so I felt like

469
00:29:32,570 --> 00:29:35,590
in theory fed up with here

470
00:29:35,590 --> 00:29:39,520
Kate created this fine which is 1420

471
00:29:39,520 --> 00:29:42,570
8 Christian its 16

472
00:29:42,570 --> 00:29:48,250
I am to remember what the problem is

473
00:29:48,250 --> 00:29:55,250
K men here so it processes the frame

474
00:29:56,070 --> 00:30:00,950
for huge burst it displays what what
candidate found something since finds

475
00:30:00,950 --> 00:30:03,010
missing something it's fights consul
detail

476
00:30:03,010 --> 00:30:06,320
or things like that but for the voice
data it created

477
00:30:06,320 --> 00:30:10,649
in theory to put in full screen okay a

478
00:30:10,649 --> 00:30:13,779
it created those two fives speech DL and
speech

479
00:30:13,779 --> 00:30:17,429
UN which corresponds to a speech on for
the opening in the SPEED Channel 4

480
00:30:17,429 --> 00:30:24,429
donning come his way I can though play
those

481
00:30:31,530 --> 00:30:33,790
when this is that there was silence at
the start because it actually

482
00:30:33,790 --> 00:30:35,460
transferred silence from

483
00:30:35,460 --> 00:30:42,460
even actually comes with the phone yet
good

484
00:30:46,150 --> 00:30:53,150
sleep

485
00:30:53,570 --> 00:30:58,189
talking about home what don't

486
00:30:58,190 --> 00:31:01,649
strongest from

487
00:31:01,649 --> 00:31:07,450
and

488
00:31:07,450 --> 00:31:10,830
so this was the the downing channel and
us use a

489
00:31:10,830 --> 00:31:15,168
do what you heard what I said

490
00:31:15,169 --> 00:31:18,379
and of course the a franchise

491
00:31:18,379 --> 00:31:24,460
send for the other channel Kane

492
00:31:24,460 --> 00:31:31,460
commit response

493
00:31:33,720 --> 00:31:37,530
okay so um official summer in

494
00:31:37,530 --> 00:31:41,670
a vastly dishonest s different political
foes that sits

495
00:31:41,670 --> 00:31:44,970
very clear I am the attack suppose

496
00:31:44,970 --> 00:31:48,130
very simple in principle and

497
00:31:48,130 --> 00:31:51,710
for a cheap to implement certain you can
only imagine that he finish more people

498
00:31:51,710 --> 00:31:52,460
spend time

499
00:31:52,460 --> 00:31:55,520
you know working on this with you could
possibly find a

500
00:31:55,520 --> 00:31:58,799
a.m. on this and and no was to

501
00:31:58,799 --> 00:32:02,549
the hardware that exists and this and
this often so its own

502
00:32:02,549 --> 00:32:06,700
it becomes very very easy a

503
00:32:06,700 --> 00:32:10,270
what kind of stuff did you do to in the
future

504
00:32:10,270 --> 00:32:13,990
um okay

505
00:32:13,990 --> 00:32:17,160
when problem that'd

506
00:32:17,160 --> 00:32:22,020
that happens a.m. a lot if you should
try to turn it into a commercial network

507
00:32:22,020 --> 00:32:28,059
is that the phone doesn't directly go to
voice channel EC central control channel

508
00:32:28,059 --> 00:32:28,710
and then

509
00:32:28,710 --> 00:32:32,480
deciphering is enabled and when the
phone is actually answered you get

510
00:32:32,480 --> 00:32:34,770
switched to voice channel up

511
00:32:34,770 --> 00:32:38,070
just got some problems you want to
actually listen to the to the voice

512
00:32:38,070 --> 00:32:39,020
cause because

513
00:32:39,020 --> 00:32:42,120
the the assignments before chances
transmit

514
00:32:42,120 --> 00:32:47,240
insightful deciphered so you have to
credit very very fast if you want to

515
00:32:47,240 --> 00:32:47,900
follow

516
00:32:47,900 --> 00:32:51,039
follow it but instead of just

517
00:32:51,039 --> 00:32:54,260
um following the assignment

518
00:32:54,260 --> 00:32:57,640
up the network you can monitor the the
transmission power

519
00:32:57,640 --> 00:33:01,860
that you that you detect on the on those
people sees and you will see clear

520
00:33:01,860 --> 00:33:05,940
if the Sun isn't too busy you were
seated

521
00:33:05,940 --> 00:33:10,350
you have earth power and then it drops
when the Chinese cat and then when it's

522
00:33:10,350 --> 00:33:13,460
assign is he did he tries again and

523
00:33:13,460 --> 00:33:17,460
that allows you to break like the other
the opening sequence and stuff like that

524
00:33:17,460 --> 00:33:19,260
but just an idea of power

525
00:33:19,260 --> 00:33:22,559
if the citizen too busy one

526
00:33:22,559 --> 00:33:26,620
problem with this approach is what's
called discontinuous transmission

527
00:33:26,620 --> 00:33:30,000
basically to save power both in your
phone and in the network

528
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:33,409
when there is nothing to transmit like
silence a.m. it doesn't actually

529
00:33:33,409 --> 00:33:34,429
transmitting

530
00:33:34,429 --> 00:33:39,130
so you don't detect and the year any
power at all hopefully there is always

531
00:33:39,130 --> 00:33:42,159
the control channel that

532
00:33:42,159 --> 00:33:46,100
thats Associated and this one is always
transmitted so you can always meet all

533
00:33:46,100 --> 00:33:46,520
dat

534
00:33:46,520 --> 00:33:50,260
there was this that own it so you
everest data points to to find

535
00:33:50,260 --> 00:33:54,809
the assignment but I think it should be
possible to turn into something to try

536
00:33:54,809 --> 00:33:59,970
um something as we started to walking on
issues in the fulness BTS

537
00:33:59,970 --> 00:34:04,030
because Tom if you want to experiment
with this

538
00:34:04,030 --> 00:34:07,559
%uh like the network we know help us
welcome the funeral on

539
00:34:07,559 --> 00:34:12,730
the cheap phones but if you want to furs
like your you iPhone

540
00:34:12,730 --> 00:34:16,530
from the network you use to left bit of
investment because you have to either

541
00:34:16,530 --> 00:34:17,070
gets

542
00:34:17,070 --> 00:34:21,760
the US happy to run like open BTS or
near BTS will be s11

543
00:34:21,760 --> 00:34:25,300
bills heart right now a.m.

544
00:34:25,300 --> 00:34:29,730
and they are in Chiba me know and I'll
be just like it's wonderful here cost

545
00:34:29,730 --> 00:34:30,030
like

546
00:34:30,030 --> 00:34:33,220
30 2009 so

547
00:34:33,220 --> 00:34:36,730
the 3000 psi yeah

548
00:34:36,730 --> 00:34:40,760
so she could do it was a twenty you
reform the

549
00:34:40,760 --> 00:34:44,589
that would be great and I think it's
possible at least using two phones

550
00:34:44,589 --> 00:34:48,489
different something we want to look into
and

551
00:34:48,490 --> 00:34:52,220
some other people we're talking about

552
00:34:52,220 --> 00:34:56,320
using it for direct phone to phone
communication up this was something you

553
00:34:56,320 --> 00:34:56,570
could

554
00:34:56,560 --> 00:34:59,619
probably usually do and you know
whatever you can think of

555
00:34:59,619 --> 00:35:02,780
if you find something that you think is
interesting and the

556
00:35:02,780 --> 00:35:07,800
please research it and reduce beckons he
finished it's really possible and try to

557
00:35:07,800 --> 00:35:08,760
implemented

558
00:35:08,760 --> 00:35:12,410
it would be great um

559
00:35:12,410 --> 00:35:16,118
fine and thanks to best for everyone
that am

560
00:35:16,119 --> 00:35:20,030
contributes to open switches and
projects and the

561
00:35:20,030 --> 00:35:25,050
the most notable names of course are the
world ditto

562
00:35:25,050 --> 00:35:28,090
David Burgess that Watson on BTS

563
00:35:28,090 --> 00:35:31,170
custom Norfolk if I Project Nim

564
00:35:31,170 --> 00:35:35,750
order that Fox an autumn open BC in
Andrea Swiss

565
00:35:35,750 --> 00:35:39,350
make almost single-handedly implemented
the mobile application

566
00:35:39,350 --> 00:35:44,450
the party or suffer smoke a BB awesome
thanks to the internet from the Asian

567
00:35:44,450 --> 00:35:45,609
move from that

568
00:35:45,610 --> 00:35:49,810
part of her but this world um

569
00:35:49,810 --> 00:35:55,690
here is some reference that you can read
best Media Pro project if you want to

570
00:35:55,690 --> 00:35:56,910
use to use a P-two

571
00:35:56,910 --> 00:36:00,170
miss into traffic has become BB

572
00:36:00,170 --> 00:36:03,860
Tom for the software um

573
00:36:03,860 --> 00:36:07,110
veterans in this phone or snow that the
the stiff occurred

574
00:36:07,110 --> 00:36:12,080
basin to get now it's a it may not be
the latest version but I i

575
00:36:12,080 --> 00:36:18,560
will push the latest version soon open
PST open business and and finally

576
00:36:18,560 --> 00:36:19,509
pleaser

577
00:36:19,510 --> 00:36:22,680
regis inspect if you're interested
because

578
00:36:22,680 --> 00:36:26,609
them its a.m.

579
00:36:26,610 --> 00:36:29,440
it yeah okay might be a little
intimidating because there's like a

580
00:36:29,440 --> 00:36:32,650
little its persecution but you don't
have to read them or

581
00:36:32,650 --> 00:36:36,290
there are fewer a few pointers in the
beginning your

582
00:36:36,290 --> 00:36:39,590
of was persecution you could read
defending him what you're into

583
00:36:39,590 --> 00:36:42,970
interested in and %uh said

584
00:36:42,970 --> 00:36:49,970
thank you for attention me when I for

585
00:36:52,010 --> 00:36:59,010
a question yes

586
00:37:02,760 --> 00:37:06,089
private questions to clarify the him she
did thats

587
00:37:06,089 --> 00:37:09,369
does a.m. you can you actually send

588
00:37:09,369 --> 00:37:13,030
that you see in the GMC on from

589
00:37:13,030 --> 00:37:16,549
anywhere in the network or do you really
have to be in the kitchen area

590
00:37:16,549 --> 00:37:20,920
heard it up from what I've tested its on
on the location area

591
00:37:20,920 --> 00:37:25,220
but own it is that the like for networks
I i don't know

592
00:37:25,220 --> 00:37:30,289
maybe there are some bad implementations
other dispositions isn't really a up

593
00:37:30,289 --> 00:37:33,780
say that you must check but it seems
obvious that

594
00:37:33,780 --> 00:37:36,849
you should so and

595
00:37:36,849 --> 00:37:40,020
did you did you try 'em or your the
networks

596
00:37:40,020 --> 00:37:43,680
adjusted with the team's yen bows both
teams the NMC

597
00:37:43,680 --> 00:37:46,940
do the I just did actually only tested
was it

598
00:37:46,940 --> 00:37:50,220
it was the emcee because each time I
didn't know my emergency

599
00:37:50,220 --> 00:37:53,780
but I know that the phone sends the
team's is as it should work with the

600
00:37:53,780 --> 00:37:54,500
times as well

601
00:37:54,500 --> 00:38:01,500
but I just as India get thank you and
did

602
00:38:03,920 --> 00:38:08,720
trying to make the same exercise that
the second one that you did to be there

603
00:38:08,720 --> 00:38:12,579
am the boys which is included with a 5-1
and if you did it

604
00:38:12,579 --> 00:38:15,630
how long it would def takin to get the
boys

605
00:38:15,630 --> 00:38:20,170
when it's encrypted I'm I E

606
00:38:20,170 --> 00:38:23,760
okay um I'd

607
00:38:23,760 --> 00:38:27,740
I dumped burst that way and Krypton it
was that it wasn't Voice

608
00:38:27,740 --> 00:38:31,339
but it was a it was control data know
it's

609
00:38:31,339 --> 00:38:35,509
since you get better Peter said the same
data out of this program is to get

610
00:38:35,510 --> 00:38:40,190
from their probe up the time to crack is
exactly the same so it would

611
00:38:40,190 --> 00:38:43,720
every depend on %um your machine engine
on it takes like

612
00:38:43,720 --> 00:38:47,680
you need 8 bursts a for of known
plaintext

613
00:38:47,680 --> 00:38:52,250
a.m. and it takes artisan on my serve a
Dixon one minute

614
00:38:52,250 --> 00:38:56,210
might burst to break its you soon the
same

615
00:38:56,210 --> 00:38:59,589
missing demonstration with the cool
which is encrypt the

616
00:38:59,589 --> 00:39:04,240
with a 5-1 with be the crypt in the same
amount of time you could have done the

617
00:39:04,240 --> 00:39:05,420
demonstration yeah

618
00:39:05,420 --> 00:39:12,420
yankee thank you I'm

619
00:39:12,609 --> 00:39:15,619
when you try to you record just to be
sure

620
00:39:15,619 --> 00:39:19,130
a.m. a fair warning prompted calls as
you try

621
00:39:19,130 --> 00:39:23,809
to break the key you will just have the
possiblity to read the Comfort Inn &

622
00:39:23,809 --> 00:39:27,299
get voice channel assignment after you
break the key so

623
00:39:27,299 --> 00:39:32,029
used to call it long enough you will
have possibilities Jim Jones but

624
00:39:32,029 --> 00:39:34,099
otherwise you would lose

625
00:39:34,099 --> 00:39:38,630
at least one minute you may use at least
one minute to school

626
00:39:38,630 --> 00:39:42,109
yes he's taken exactly that that's
that's a problem with that you would

627
00:39:42,109 --> 00:39:44,509
face a ship trying to listen to voice
channel in the

628
00:39:44,510 --> 00:39:48,589
on the commercial right the talk right
now is that you'll you don't know

629
00:39:48,589 --> 00:39:52,380
where to go so that's why trying to
monitor China was the

630
00:39:52,380 --> 00:39:56,510
RF power would be interesting the other
option is ons more sense

631
00:39:56,510 --> 00:39:59,819
using like a separate phones you can
actually continuously

632
00:39:59,819 --> 00:40:03,210
dump every voice channel and then

633
00:40:03,210 --> 00:40:07,059
after what's wants to know where u what
you should have listened to you can just

634
00:40:07,059 --> 00:40:10,230
I mean journalism are there a UF

635
00:40:10,230 --> 00:40:14,609

whether the so that one frequency can

636
00:40:14,609 --> 00:40:14,900
host

637
00:40:14,900 --> 00:40:18,279
a tent lots I am and the

638
00:40:18,279 --> 00:40:22,049
some says if only one frequency also
Steph like

639
00:40:22,049 --> 00:40:25,950
33 so it let's get a lot and over phone
can record

640
00:40:25,950 --> 00:40:29,029
for time slots befriend things
