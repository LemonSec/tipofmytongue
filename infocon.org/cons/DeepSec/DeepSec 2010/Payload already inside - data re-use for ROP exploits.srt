00:00:01,100 --> 00:00:05,350
I hi so this one is supposed to be

2
00:00:05,350 --> 00:00:08,400
majorie the of the world yet read by

3
00:00:08,400 --> 00:00:11,580
one of my friend long but he not be able

4
00:00:11,580 --> 00:00:14,839
make it today I so

5
00:00:14,839 --> 00:00:18,230
isn't it again to

6
00:00:18,230 --> 00:00:21,869
all today up school

7
00:00:21,869 --> 00:00:25,039
waste the up on this one the

8
00:00:25,039 --> 00:00:28,060
thingy that most of modern

9
00:00:28,060 --> 00:00:31,369
operating system now day love

10
00:00:31,369 --> 00:00:36,320
different profession fall security
vulnerabilities or

11
00:00:36,320 --> 00:00:39,360
you can see days like none Skee

12
00:00:39,360 --> 00:00:42,990
and ice I address state-run

13
00:00:42,990 --> 00:00:48,830
layout randomization I they have to ask
ya Madras mapping

14
00:00:48,830 --> 00:00:53,330
aspect perfect the whatever up
compilation probation

15
00:00:53,330 --> 00:00:57,140
and own a piece protection

16
00:00:57,140 --> 00:01:01,050
make us some Kyle play s PlayStation
hotter

17
00:01:01,050 --> 00:01:05,780
and especially for the TechNet live
return are in that programming

18
00:01:05,780 --> 00:01:09,980
a weak dollar really good I addressed a
rundown

19
00:01:09,980 --> 00:01:14,320
my Jason that actually is will be pretty
hot will do that

20
00:01:14,320 --> 00:01:17,750
I so indeed

21
00:01:17,750 --> 00:01:21,560
actually we r propose and talking about
what

22
00:01:21,560 --> 00:01:26,830
up to practical and reliable way still
week combination of multiple different

23
00:01:26,830 --> 00:01:27,490
thicknesses

24
00:01:27,490 --> 00:01:33,110
out to be able to bypass an axe aspect
memory mapping cherry

25
00:01:33,110 --> 00:01:36,790
%uh Asli Askim I'm our profession

26
00:01:36,790 --> 00:01:39,820
on I state the state up

27
00:01:39,820 --> 00:01:44,690
hoping to see some basically we r
demostration dismay online us but we

28
00:01:44,690 --> 00:01:46,149
have working

29
00:01:46,150 --> 00:01:49,520
past that fall BS the Lena's

30
00:01:49,520 --> 00:01:53,940
Mac OS and I'll upcoming one is also
Windows

31
00:01:53,940 --> 00:01:58,020
a solo

32
00:01:58,020 --> 00:02:01,170
basically we use the month is that I'll
be

33
00:02:01,170 --> 00:02:04,229
I'll combination thickness will be able

34
00:02:04,229 --> 00:02:08,929
up to have some of this past year old
with to bypass that probation estate

35
00:02:08,929 --> 00:02:10,149
want to do whatever

36
00:02:10,149 --> 00:02:13,590
on all you want to do and a

37
00:02:13,590 --> 00:02:18,370
in order to ultimate or not this guy up
things and make it very easy to people

38
00:02:18,370 --> 00:02:22,630
use and we have to alone where weekend

39
00:02:22,630 --> 00:02:25,799
had a practical out P got it Capello

40
00:02:25,800 --> 00:02:28,950
and also suboptimal that up the nation
and

41
00:02:28,950 --> 00:02:32,459
many others like bass easy to do to
stripping

42
00:02:32,459 --> 00:02:36,490
I

43
00:02:36,490 --> 00:02:40,150
and this thought not talking about I'll
be

44
00:02:40,150 --> 00:02:43,270
assault actually we only use out the
flaws

45
00:02:43,270 --> 00:02:46,720
bypassed some up to probation this one
in not really

46
00:02:46,720 --> 00:02:50,470
talking about out rethought oriented
programming I'll

47
00:02:50,470 --> 00:02:54,010
with I was on not going to thought about
light

48
00:02:54,010 --> 00:02:57,980
Asli lamentation flow all whatever
information

49
00:02:57,980 --> 00:03:02,859
late I compilation professional expect
protects the

50
00:03:02,860 --> 00:03:06,459
anything like that all mandatory
assessed controls or

51
00:03:06,459 --> 00:03:12,209
I'm not going to stop by the Scotty so

52
00:03:12,209 --> 00:03:16,080
this 1i would try to go very fast
because just basic

53
00:03:16,080 --> 00:03:19,709
things and just to recap us this one is
just a basic

54
00:03:19,709 --> 00:03:25,180
I but both flow problem and disgusting I
think simple things

55
00:03:25,180 --> 00:03:28,420
us on nowadays lifeless and motor

56
00:03:28,420 --> 00:03:32,010
leno's week they have love the friend
mitigation thickness

57
00:03:32,010 --> 00:03:35,090
I I mentioned before not excusable

58
00:03:35,090 --> 00:03:38,220
like have to the ace I Cecil

59
00:03:38,220 --> 00:03:42,379
whatsoever I would guess about phoned
hot weather is so

60
00:03:42,379 --> 00:03:45,810
my desi you with and Ice Ice the bit are

61
00:03:45,810 --> 00:03:49,099
by software emulation days up

62
00:03:49,099 --> 00:03:52,640
the IRS they lay out on my from my Jason

63
00:03:52,640 --> 00:03:55,989
like ASL out where his support their am
NOT

64
00:03:55,989 --> 00:04:00,030
read on my mapping office thanks hit I
remember mapping

65
00:04:00,030 --> 00:04:03,470
satellite re and also the application
Bay his

66
00:04:03,470 --> 00:04:06,640
reply to company Sopot week does that

67
00:04:06,640 --> 00:04:10,250
BAE things and

68
00:04:10,250 --> 00:04:15,370
like SSC a fun read happy also introduce
ASCII I'm not making

69
00:04:15,370 --> 00:04:19,269
I where on the satellite re actually

70
00:04:19,269 --> 00:04:22,669
movie relocate inda into ASCII

71
00:04:22,669 --> 00:04:25,748
I'm of the area which is the first 16
may go by

72
00:04:25,749 --> 00:04:30,629
and I with me live readdress that week
been owned by

73
00:04:30,629 --> 00:04:33,729
so actually can still let you know I'll

74
00:04:33,729 --> 00:04:37,029
having done owned by in the return so
this will be

75
00:04:37,029 --> 00:04:40,229
up block I applied returned the Lipsy
Kyle

76
00:04:40,229 --> 00:04:44,469
attack and also days

77
00:04:44,469 --> 00:04:48,308
up compilation rotation late suspect but
they to SSP

78
00:04:48,309 --> 00:04:52,180
broke a light for the FY sauce this from
captains

79
00:04:52,180 --> 00:04:57,240
where they put less that can resist a
cookie so

80
00:04:57,240 --> 00:05:02,610
place him on this one is one assemble of
ahh how to memory mapping

81
00:05:02,610 --> 00:05:06,779
I you can see here the address up don't
lie re

82
00:05:06,779 --> 00:05:10,770
starting with known by with East ASCII a
Maltese

83
00:05:10,770 --> 00:05:14,210
obvious one not excusable display with
his

84
00:05:14,210 --> 00:05:19,169
and ice and here the snow PE so that's
one

85
00:05:19,169 --> 00:05:22,900
that let go by various out making
include

86
00:05:22,900 --> 00:05:26,569
odd is is not run on my photo photo by
resell

87
00:05:26,569 --> 00:05:29,939
and as: allies car despite hit and
things like that

88
00:05:29,939 --> 00:05:36,740
everytime good run actually is will look
different right

89
00:05:36,740 --> 00:05:39,759
so this one HS up quick I love you

90
00:05:39,759 --> 00:05:43,990
up light this wanted to rezone up to up
to a PX

91
00:05:43,990 --> 00:05:47,499
fast under fidora 13

92
00:05:47,499 --> 00:05:50,550
and a gentle happen with the happened

93
00:05:50,550 --> 00:05:53,770
a kono the pussy 30

94
00:05:53,770 --> 00:05:57,258
tool so you see under and one drama my
Jason

95
00:05:57,259 --> 00:06:00,860
this one the first one to fund a red hat
and a second one flooded

96
00:06:00,860 --> 00:06:04,279
gentle with the PS and yes security

97
00:06:04,279 --> 00:06:08,999
thanks so you can see for the scouting
actually far

98
00:06:08,999 --> 00:06:12,449
light about light that the in 16 I

99
00:06:12,449 --> 00:06:16,249
bit is actually break the easy to the
profile

100
00:06:16,249 --> 00:06:20,069
and day days even something they want
they shouldn't throw

101
00:06:20,069 --> 00:06:23,559
on Dobrev Escano actually you can try

102
00:06:23,559 --> 00:06:28,800
about like 40-50 family actually is this
subject will be repeated

103
00:06:28,800 --> 00:06:31,909
I

104
00:06:31,909 --> 00:06:35,998
so by passing this random address by
actually depend

105
00:06:35,999 --> 00:06:39,259
this debate depend on race depend on how
de eso out

106
00:06:39,259 --> 00:06:42,439
implementation other in if environment

107
00:06:42,439 --> 00:06:47,490
like to and how to belittle radius well

108
00:06:47,490 --> 00:06:50,629
so this one is the bay on so dirty at

109
00:06:50,629 --> 00:06:54,679
on basic us take a look below and got
injection

110
00:06:54,679 --> 00:06:58,119
just keep this I returned to lift the
Wii to

111
00:06:58,119 --> 00:07:01,429
steamboating way you'll return back to

112
00:07:01,429 --> 00:07:05,659
library funds unless a possible return
back to the system

113
00:07:05,659 --> 00:07:08,830
and I mentioned before it will be pretty
hot

114
00:07:08,830 --> 00:07:12,520
week the Asli an ASCII on all because is

115
00:07:12,520 --> 00:07:16,969
actually dull Lipsy funds and a saudi
friend of mine

116
00:07:16,969 --> 00:07:20,558
and does like also random sites

117
00:07:20,559 --> 00:07:25,099
spread not easy to let you know the
location up to a common understanding

118
00:07:25,099 --> 00:07:29,119
and you have a problem with it and by
and also is pretty hot

119
00:07:29,119 --> 00:07:36,119
and also because known by Scott to make
the Chan treatment elliptical

120
00:07:36,729 --> 00:07:40,628
I I'll be is the recently

121
00:07:40,629 --> 00:07:44,159
in the last two years actually is new up
coming up so but

122
00:07:44,159 --> 00:07:47,219
actually is base on the return to leave
city and borough

123
00:07:47,219 --> 00:07:50,679
got John Kyle ideas is

124
00:07:50,679 --> 00:07:54,469
I basically is light that the other
gasket

125
00:07:54,469 --> 00:07:58,580
a delight the sequin update Russian
ending week to return

126
00:07:58,580 --> 00:08:02,308
but it's not necessary to be ending
victory done I mean can be

127
00:08:02,309 --> 00:08:06,639
and a week like Jim biggest something
like that

128
00:08:06,639 --> 00:08:10,080
so here some assemble at the gasket

129
00:08:10,080 --> 00:08:13,859
today 5 similar not a valid the rig is
the with people

130
00:08:13,860 --> 00:08:16,929
something really is tho and return so
you can

131
00:08:16,929 --> 00:08:20,039
actually look good value include a EBS

132
00:08:20,039 --> 00:08:23,199
biggest a of us and what is what you can
live

133
00:08:23,199 --> 00:08:26,439
lay us save at my phone

134
00:08:26,439 --> 00:08:29,459
fonda from the spec biter all

135
00:08:29,459 --> 00:08:32,750
you at some value include a memory
location

136
00:08:32,750 --> 00:08:35,849
i say more saudis this tea scones

137
00:08:35,849 --> 00:08:41,539
getting it in the lockout p

138
00:08:41,539 --> 00:08:44,569
so we got I'll be I we this

139
00:08:44,570 --> 00:08:47,960
on this thing that would end up number
up kit actually

140
00:08:47,960 --> 00:08:51,220
weekend oda I'll during comet

141
00:08:51,220 --> 00:08:54,560
up light a b-tree computation

142
00:08:54,560 --> 00:08:58,660
I however in the practical the problem
me that

143
00:08:58,660 --> 00:09:02,530
I actually day is very limited number of

144
00:09:02,530 --> 00:09:06,180
get cases where you can really use for
blue book bindery

145
00:09:06,180 --> 00:09:09,230
and live rehab malls get guess but

146
00:09:09,230 --> 00:09:13,640
however does run on my whatever live
remapping

147
00:09:13,640 --> 00:09:16,730
out ASCII on largely mike is made
difficult

148
00:09:16,730 --> 00:09:19,780
to do light I Jan

149
00:09:19,780 --> 00:09:23,060
or whatever re I'll be

150
00:09:23,060 --> 00:09:28,060
bailout and thing like that

151
00:09:28,060 --> 00:09:31,770
this one just some summary on this

152
00:09:31,770 --> 00:09:34,900
where in fact best outing

153
00:09:34,900 --> 00:09:38,300
yes really deep and very deep and then
on life how to battery how to put a

154
00:09:38,300 --> 00:09:39,040
bullet the

155
00:09:39,040 --> 00:09:42,240
and a thing like that and week the phone
protection

156
00:09:42,240 --> 00:09:45,740
light BAE spec cannery scale mall

157
00:09:45,740 --> 00:09:49,430
sting like a I day East

158
00:09:49,430 --> 00:09:52,830
January is the rate right the hospital
estimate

159
00:09:52,830 --> 00:09:57,000
the by real quick like enable phone Kyle
protection

160
00:09:57,000 --> 00:10:00,280
I however is not is still dependent
night

161
00:10:00,280 --> 00:10:03,660
is some case for example a remotely you
may be able

162
00:10:03,660 --> 00:10:07,500
like to see some thoughtful whatever you
may be able to prove thought it

163
00:10:07,500 --> 00:10:10,890
and a subway to low profile is much
faster

164
00:10:10,890 --> 00:10:13,990
I lyle shud I try one by one but

165
00:10:13,990 --> 00:10:17,500
trucked right for every up by and

166
00:10:17,500 --> 00:10:21,230
light you may you don't need to elect
right lot up

167
00:10:21,230 --> 00:10:25,720
time inaudible to figure out what's the
right value fund unless a distinct

168
00:10:25,720 --> 00:10:26,840
cookie

169
00:10:26,840 --> 00:10:30,700
the base address up by reacting and you
can do to

170
00:10:30,700 --> 00:10:34,020
not Mon I split station

171
00:10:34,020 --> 00:10:40,160
want to figure out a the Press

172
00:10:40,160 --> 00:10:43,170
I so now it will move into the next one

173
00:10:43,170 --> 00:10:47,329
with is the combination thickness where
we trying to

174
00:10:47,330 --> 00:10:50,520
%uh in their mandate to bypass some of
those

175
00:10:50,520 --> 00:10:53,520
rotation the basic idea is

176
00:10:53,520 --> 00:10:57,550
bill a generous s0 bailout where is

177
00:10:57,550 --> 00:11:00,730
can help to bypass light you know spec

178
00:11:00,730 --> 00:11:04,000
memory mapping I run tonight I

179
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:07,170
then and nice ASCII I'm on probation

180
00:11:07,170 --> 00:11:10,870
a week the idea of using vase vein

181
00:11:10,870 --> 00:11:14,520
light minimum number of the out the

182
00:11:14,520 --> 00:11:17,960
got guess is cited by ARY had there is
an

183
00:11:17,960 --> 00:11:21,730
land mass and the fall up out P

184
00:11:21,730 --> 00:11:24,820
in Jerry is night to have however

185
00:11:24,820 --> 00:11:27,950
the the number up real I'll be

186
00:11:27,950 --> 00:11:31,210
get gas his side excusable fight is
limited

187
00:11:31,210 --> 00:11:35,420
and obvious fate depended on by binary
and binary

188
00:11:35,420 --> 00:11:38,680
so the idea here is just use

189
00:11:38,680 --> 00:11:42,780
on the feel witness a viable on mall so
the binary

190
00:11:42,780 --> 00:11:46,170
I fi symbol most how to buy recalled by

191
00:11:46,170 --> 00:11:49,290
and with gcc would have and up number

192
00:11:49,290 --> 00:11:53,480
up get get to bill DUP

193
00:11:53,480 --> 00:11:57,800
dust s0 and fund the state's row is Luke
be

194
00:11:57,800 --> 00:12:01,340
able to look North phone and the
public's that

195
00:12:01,340 --> 00:12:05,820
the next this that one bailout which you
can put anything inside us that lot

196
00:12:05,820 --> 00:12:09,660
so does that one bailout could be
anything could be to fully

197
00:12:09,660 --> 00:12:13,430
out the so-called could be to Chandler I
Lipsy cologne

198
00:12:13,430 --> 00:12:17,380
all maybe just an almost cellco on

199
00:12:17,380 --> 00:12:20,560
so that's is the basic idea up to

200
00:12:20,560 --> 00:12:24,680
though up the metallicity I

201
00:12:24,680 --> 00:12:27,820
so the first thing for dust that you're
also the idea of

202
00:12:27,820 --> 00:12:33,250
up this one be the first thing actually
we are trying to promote await the beers

203
00:12:33,250 --> 00:12:37,620
I the first thing we actually we trying
to build up as expect a new site

204
00:12:37,620 --> 00:12:40,700
at an old location so at week

205
00:12:40,700 --> 00:12:45,120
this it with this way actually you can
be able to full control of this thing

206
00:12:45,120 --> 00:12:48,570
it on the 3rd worry about whatever
threat to my state a great

207
00:12:48,570 --> 00:12:52,070
any longer one District Attorney respect

208
00:12:52,070 --> 00:12:55,280
and is I is easy to control of funds and

209
00:12:55,280 --> 00:12:58,819
woman and whatsoever a common under on
the news that

210
00:12:58,820 --> 00:13:02,130
a harder Chan return to live CR out
peace

211
00:13:02,130 --> 00:13:06,120
up cellco

212
00:13:06,120 --> 00:13:12,530
and also you can control a suspect
friend

213
00:13:12,530 --> 00:13:16,240
so here it is on it a sample of light

214
00:13:16,240 --> 00:13:20,290
the benefit up up having up on a suspect
in the face

215
00:13:20,290 --> 00:13:23,310
location by some but we chose this
address with is

216
00:13:23,310 --> 00:13:26,350
in the date that session awesome %uh

217
00:13:26,350 --> 00:13:29,430
yeah in the date that session the use at

218
00:13:29,430 --> 00:13:33,950
on new location for newsday and farm
this land you can see you can control

219
00:13:33,950 --> 00:13:34,340
the

220
00:13:34,340 --> 00:13:39,060
next expand and things like that and you
actually can control the hauntings

221
00:13:39,060 --> 00:13:43,240
easier so the location for that

222
00:13:43,240 --> 00:13:47,600
just any reliable locations with is less
a debate that section of something like

223
00:13:47,600 --> 00:13:48,810
that

224
00:13:48,810 --> 00:13:52,600
possible in the binary you can use lay
these

225
00:13:52,600 --> 00:13:55,860
session like date that the SS that cat
thing

226
00:13:55,860 --> 00:14:00,550
actually can use under for the suspect
location updates like

227
00:14:00,550 --> 00:14:03,800
and

228
00:14:03,800 --> 00:14:07,000
and actually the state's euro is them

229
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:11,130
the pulse of the state ups that really
actually the trend funded real

230
00:14:11,130 --> 00:14:14,740
real by a lot of the state line include
a new site

231
00:14:14,740 --> 00:14:18,230
I so in order to transfer the state one

232
00:14:18,230 --> 00:14:21,870
they note we can you sum up out be light
low Creek

233
00:14:21,870 --> 00:14:25,040
basically the way we trying to in their
monies

234
00:14:25,040 --> 00:14:28,260
I just think just the minimum number of
I'll be got yes

235
00:14:28,260 --> 00:14:31,600
so basically we only need to have
something like luxurious those

236
00:14:31,600 --> 00:14:34,950
all memory card reptile biggest the and
dust

237
00:14:34,950 --> 00:14:38,230
one is just on most and up

238
00:14:38,230 --> 00:14:42,590
up to do that thinks and up

239
00:14:42,590 --> 00:14:46,290
so the question is way the date up to us
that one

240
00:14:46,290 --> 00:14:52,069
bailout sewed up a lot a cell those that
want a lot a cell is let's say I have

241
00:14:52,070 --> 00:14:55,310
light dots that one may not be 100 bikes

242
00:14:55,310 --> 00:14:59,160
%uh so how how can I transfer that 100
back to news that

243
00:14:59,160 --> 00:15:02,250
so the idea a that we actually reduce

244
00:15:02,250 --> 00:15:05,730
funded date back inside to buy to resell
so

245
00:15:05,730 --> 00:15:09,520
I I really dumb a slight

246
00:15:09,520 --> 00:15:13,600
I we can use the string copy of spring
at a lot everything's

247
00:15:13,600 --> 00:15:17,040
and we've returned to does funds and and
trying to copy

248
00:15:17,040 --> 00:15:20,449
the the date that we won on the binary
SL

249
00:15:20,450 --> 00:15:25,000
into the news that

250
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:28,760
I so this one ego hahaha algorithm look

251
00:15:28,760 --> 00:15:32,540
Saudi in a book for the specs 0 is this
that one they look

252
00:15:32,540 --> 00:15:35,890
and output is the spectral Bay note week

253
00:15:35,890 --> 00:15:39,410
be health the trend for this that one
Baylor included custom

254
00:15:39,410 --> 00:15:42,600
spec after transfer to come this that
one

255
00:15:42,600 --> 00:15:46,640
they don't then is we're just sick if
does that friend

256
00:15:46,640 --> 00:15:50,120
I holidays can do that so I mentioned
before

257
00:15:50,120 --> 00:15:54,210
ilsa just that one eight hundred by so I
just looking for both

258
00:15:54,210 --> 00:15:58,410
first by second by the sick one up to
buy in the state length a lot and

259
00:15:58,410 --> 00:15:59,740
searching for gold bigass

260
00:15:59,740 --> 00:16:03,910
in the binary itself so when I fighter
the

261
00:16:03,910 --> 00:16:08,329
the date the date that is seen that data
into binary that I was generate a string

262
00:16:08,330 --> 00:16:09,620
copy call

263
00:16:09,620 --> 00:16:13,400
where with the sauce ada Patrick up to
buy pot and binary

264
00:16:13,400 --> 00:16:18,140
and a destination it custom stay so but
and keep repeating until

265
00:16:18,140 --> 00:16:23,420
it finished the state one so ap third is
that role

266
00:16:23,420 --> 00:16:26,740
odd done right actually you would happen
Neil

267
00:16:26,740 --> 00:16:33,740
custom spec with the force that one
bailout over to

268
00:16:34,180 --> 00:16:37,190
so if I sample he s is on the same bowl
of

269
00:16:37,190 --> 00:16:40,880
us that want to trade first latvians
last cell into

270
00:16:40,880 --> 00:16:44,410
this at Red so assuming that this one

271
00:16:44,410 --> 00:16:48,120
is the us some location in the date that
would be reliable

272
00:16:48,120 --> 00:16:52,070
and where I want to build a new the new
spec

273
00:16:52,070 --> 00:16:55,670
up so here is the PLT a blistering copy

274
00:16:55,670 --> 00:16:58,950
and I have some got get to build a the

275
00:16:58,950 --> 00:17:02,529
look good against LA lot divided into
EBS

276
00:17:02,529 --> 00:17:06,249
a bpm ABBA just against just keep it

277
00:17:06,249 --> 00:17:09,709
and the thoughts of us by simple
something like this %uh

278
00:17:09,709 --> 00:17:13,429
so what I can do is I can of item

279
00:17:13,429 --> 00:17:16,689
value in the binary is cells I know that
value up to

280
00:17:16,689 --> 00:17:20,079
at inside eat in this I'll crest

281
00:17:20,079 --> 00:17:23,559
so I can generate update the

282
00:17:23,559 --> 00:17:27,089
up a lot size: phone does s0 is
something like to address

283
00:17:27,089 --> 00:17:30,480
up to %uh destination and

284
00:17:30,480 --> 00:17:33,509
I destination sauce and next

285
00:17:33,509 --> 00:17:37,549
think fran at the bee tree EES actually
to pop up correctly

286
00:17:37,549 --> 00:17:41,279
is the that get fired and not because

287
00:17:41,279 --> 00:17:44,450
and this wine is the

288
00:17:44,450 --> 00:17:48,269
up be out the entry of a string copy so
I keep generating this one

289
00:17:48,269 --> 00:17:51,490
until is finished so own this until

290
00:17:51,490 --> 00:17:54,659
own this test 0 %uh sorry on this that
one

291
00:17:54,659 --> 00:18:01,249
up a lot already light a copy into the
news that

292
00:18:01,249 --> 00:18:04,330
so at

293
00:18:04,330 --> 00:18:07,960
end up this that you know actually I we
need though

294
00:18:07,960 --> 00:18:12,309
the sick to control toda Neil underneath
that that the new spec which just copy

295
00:18:12,309 --> 00:18:15,720
on a date out this Dec one so we
transfer to control the go to customer

296
00:18:15,720 --> 00:18:16,110
spec

297
00:18:16,110 --> 00:18:19,450
Alexis that one stopped running

298
00:18:19,450 --> 00:18:23,249
a so we only need so happy notebook BBB
return

299
00:18:23,249 --> 00:18:26,619
leaf or something like that so sick that
those tickets

300
00:18:26,619 --> 00:18:30,709
the state

301
00:18:30,710 --> 00:18:33,879
week is available is most of my re

302
00:18:33,879 --> 00:18:37,779
I'll so the step

303
00:18:37,779 --> 00:18:40,940
euros though adventist actually you can

304
00:18:40,940 --> 00:18:45,029
on in the next that you will have the
full control of the stack

305
00:18:45,029 --> 00:18:48,799
and you don't get a cab out I S key I'm
all whatsoever any longer

306
00:18:48,799 --> 00:18:52,820
because the state one can cause is up
any by including condoned by

307
00:18:52,820 --> 00:18:57,070
I in the in the up in the new custom

308
00:18:57,070 --> 00:19:00,490
aspect itself and is Bay practical

309
00:19:00,490 --> 00:19:04,049
im also the fiery we have surveys like
mark meant most ok

310
00:19:04,049 --> 00:19:08,309
distribution in a situation that we
survey on up to binary

311
00:19:08,309 --> 00:19:12,470
and actually up that thing witness
available in

312
00:19:12,470 --> 00:19:16,960
own up to my really we checked basically
we only need

313
00:19:16,960 --> 00:19:21,269
tree out the got yes fodder us that's
your only case

314
00:19:21,269 --> 00:19:24,389
some not released her %uh some

315
00:19:24,389 --> 00:19:28,690
s sup memory and outline up to spec bike
though many

316
00:19:28,690 --> 00:19:32,330
name any place and where is something
let both PPP 10

317
00:19:32,330 --> 00:19:38,490
leaf something like that

318
00:19:38,490 --> 00:19:41,759
and photos best one trade the G so this

319
00:19:41,759 --> 00:19:44,809
that that does that one could be
anything they mention befall

320
00:19:44,809 --> 00:19:48,200
just that one could be to chant return
to Lipsy call

321
00:19:48,200 --> 00:19:52,029
I now is be it's become very easy

322
00:19:52,029 --> 00:19:55,690
way I can transfer all the data and the
location of this thank you know and

323
00:19:55,690 --> 00:19:56,230
everything

324
00:19:56,230 --> 00:20:00,119
police be easy to do to generate that
the deep-sea all

325
00:20:00,119 --> 00:20:03,259
you can return back to and protect to
actually make

326
00:20:03,259 --> 00:20:07,090
the the memory become ice cube table
again

327
00:20:07,090 --> 00:20:10,918
then transfer to control the ODA good
and to the new place

328
00:20:10,919 --> 00:20:16,200
week to the novel cellco and this one
this way on so what on most distribution

329
00:20:16,200 --> 00:20:19,710
as set up like PS up

330
00:20:19,710 --> 00:20:23,299
GSA up banks security pass actually day

331
00:20:23,299 --> 00:20:27,059
if you're in a bowl and protect free
rejection and it went well

332
00:20:27,059 --> 00:20:30,408
I all maybe you can put a fully out be
so

333
00:20:30,409 --> 00:20:33,789
got dat I with is

334
00:20:33,789 --> 00:20:36,908
simple as well aptos up because this

335
00:20:36,909 --> 00:20:41,869
that one there is no limitation up you
don't need to care about a random IRS

336
00:20:41,869 --> 00:20:43,418
pays you don't need the cowbell

337
00:20:43,419 --> 00:20:46,629
ASCII I'm all you don't need to look at
my next anything so

338
00:20:46,629 --> 00:20:52,070
in a state one you can do anything you 1

339
00:20:52,070 --> 00:20:56,759
so basically on this one is peek at on
how to build a return

340
00:20:56,759 --> 00:21:01,429
to the PLT

341
00:21:01,429 --> 00:21:04,679
so in the buyer in you have to pee out
the

342
00:21:04,679 --> 00:21:09,119
and they've got and a real address in
the Lipsy

343
00:21:09,119 --> 00:21:12,439
thing ladies so you can actually
returned to the PO

344
00:21:12,440 --> 00:21:16,049
the it's that up you'll I return
directly to the

345
00:21:16,049 --> 00:21:20,929
at Red into up to freshened Lipsy

346
00:21:20,929 --> 00:21:23,970
I so that the problem

347
00:21:23,970 --> 00:21:28,340
now is like how you actually you can
Rezound runtime library a great

348
00:21:28,340 --> 00:21:31,449
up so that thingy that as some time

349
00:21:31,450 --> 00:21:35,429
the the lifts a funtion up

350
00:21:35,429 --> 00:21:40,429
that he's not level in the binary SLSA I
want to know to address up

351
00:21:40,429 --> 00:21:43,690
%uh the trim copy in the Lipsy

352
00:21:43,690 --> 00:21:47,820
and seemed up the at record roundup
random I don't know to base

353
00:21:47,820 --> 00:21:51,220
I address up the library and

354
00:21:51,220 --> 00:21:55,080
into binary is sounded and there's no
trim copy

355
00:21:55,080 --> 00:21:58,449
use it use it into in the binary itself
so that no PO

356
00:21:58,450 --> 00:22:01,539
the I entry or anything for that

357
00:22:01,539 --> 00:22:05,559
also in this one you will let the
Rezound reflects even

358
00:22:05,559 --> 00:22:09,039
I threat in the run time so let's say

359
00:22:09,039 --> 00:22:12,210
it I want to know attract up system

360
00:22:12,210 --> 00:22:15,450
and in in to buy to resell

361
00:22:15,450 --> 00:22:19,710
day some blood some it's a function that
safe bring at was used

362
00:22:19,710 --> 00:22:22,730
%uh so what I can do it I can rezone it

363
00:22:22,730 --> 00:22:26,409
in the runtime by actually

364
00:22:26,409 --> 00:22:29,629
copulated ilsa fondo

365
00:22:29,629 --> 00:22:33,570
from the from the library when his is
running it look into the memory right

366
00:22:33,570 --> 00:22:35,178
the base after I can be found on

367
00:22:35,179 --> 00:22:38,600
a however upset between built on sand is
still

368
00:22:38,600 --> 00:22:42,950
the same us so what I can do it

369
00:22:42,950 --> 00:22:46,419
actually it I want to know I dread

370
00:22:46,419 --> 00:22:51,389
up the system what I can do is lie I can
cuco let let his upset but went to bring

371
00:22:51,389 --> 00:22:52,730
a pin system

372
00:22:52,730 --> 00:22:57,860
and from this one I can just at the
upset into to bring and I have to

373
00:22:57,860 --> 00:22:59,269
address up to

374
00:22:59,269 --> 00:23:03,090
up the system up for this reason we
actually can

375
00:23:03,090 --> 00:23:07,799
re-zone & couple any at Pratt up to
function in the Liberty

376
00:23:07,799 --> 00:23:11,590
and a is Europe up got gets

377
00:23:11,590 --> 00:23:15,699
a viable in on up by re

378
00:23:15,700 --> 00:23:21,879
are so we of other fought for this one
we have cookbook if run

379
00:23:21,879 --> 00:23:25,200
up thickness fotis I dot overwriting
need

380
00:23:25,200 --> 00:23:28,840
need referencing a so funny but
overwriting

381
00:23:28,840 --> 00:23:32,149
week this one one other favor unmet
thoughtful

382
00:23:32,149 --> 00:23:35,559
legislative thought might ring but you
override ok got entry of

383
00:23:35,559 --> 00:23:40,629
someth on see sunshine out though does
some look under

384
00:23:40,629 --> 00:23:43,950
value the corn on the undercoat q1

385
00:23:43,950 --> 00:23:47,220
also just that for this one he basically
we look

386
00:23:47,220 --> 00:23:50,659
upsetting to the register and at

387
00:23:50,659 --> 00:23:53,850
that a yes the at that value in

388
00:23:53,850 --> 00:23:57,919
we is looking to decrease the that
memory kit location what you did not

389
00:23:57,919 --> 00:23:58,489
entry

390
00:23:58,489 --> 00:24:02,220
laissez you want the little up to rezone
the

391
00:24:02,220 --> 00:24:07,239
a dread up the system in the lib sees a
lot you can do is you cut colette

392
00:24:07,239 --> 00:24:11,220
upset between system and bring at day
and

393
00:24:11,220 --> 00:24:15,220
you love it introductory Easter then at
that value in dodo got

394
00:24:15,220 --> 00:24:18,779
entry up bring at so now that got mg up
bring

395
00:24:18,779 --> 00:24:21,850
bring actually by to the system in a man

396
00:24:21,850 --> 00:24:25,129
so we don't we don't know the base after
a couple ability but

397
00:24:25,129 --> 00:24:28,869
however we know that now is that got
Andrea that bring at

398
00:24:28,869 --> 00:24:33,749
in outcome panda value up I we keep like
to the system

399
00:24:33,749 --> 00:24:39,580
into Lipsy than on at the end up that we
do that we can just return to be out the

400
00:24:39,580 --> 00:24:41,789
entry

401
00:24:41,789 --> 00:24:45,230
and our peak get get for that basically
you only need

402
00:24:45,230 --> 00:24:51,509
deal with anyone look for a guess though
and get one at also memory

403
00:24:51,509 --> 00:24:54,690
quickies this one this one in this one

404
00:24:54,690 --> 00:24:59,679
is and up

405
00:24:59,679 --> 00:25:03,029
so possible he is assemble it you one

406
00:25:03,029 --> 00:25:06,720
though out the rezone a new you want to

407
00:25:06,720 --> 00:25:11,340
to help %uh you have one the note II
Trek up except the E

408
00:25:11,340 --> 00:25:15,209
%uh so you can call to you so you can SX
something else

409
00:25:15,210 --> 00:25:19,950
%uh but the binary is so in a got table
is sound is not a sec the soldier not in

410
00:25:19,950 --> 00:25:20,960
it though

411
00:25:20,960 --> 00:25:24,049
on rezone address SAP

412
00:25:24,049 --> 00:25:27,549
know that the cone it and what in this
one

413
00:25:27,549 --> 00:25:31,359
basically it just override to bring at
got entry

414
00:25:31,359 --> 00:25:34,989
and make it become bad wreck safety

415
00:25:34,989 --> 00:25:38,230
so basically here's an example of that
they look

416
00:25:38,230 --> 00:25:42,239
I this is that correct of to bring it in
the PRT

417
00:25:42,239 --> 00:25:45,259
and is likely attract up to bring at in
got

418
00:25:45,259 --> 00:25:48,869
up table and

419
00:25:48,869 --> 00:25:52,389
I think that they don't they may be a
bit hot desi

420
00:25:52,389 --> 00:25:57,090
but are basically here lay this one did
address up in

421
00:25:57,090 --> 00:26:00,090
the customs back quickly is in a date
that session

422
00:26:00,090 --> 00:26:03,259
soul the benefit of this one you know to
Sep

423
00:26:03,259 --> 00:26:07,859
value up the look do you can't control
fully controlled

424
00:26:07,859 --> 00:26:11,418
that are so Indo this one less a this
one

425
00:26:11,419 --> 00:26:14,570
either it after a quick bite to one-up

426
00:26:14,570 --> 00:26:17,840
drop got get wasteful bpm rate with me
lot

427
00:26:17,840 --> 00:26:21,169
buggy so on this one is lot

428
00:26:21,169 --> 00:26:24,429
this value into the sorry this value

429
00:26:24,429 --> 00:26:27,669
include a BP and

430
00:26:27,669 --> 00:26:32,039
the next one he spoke PCI book EDS
something like that

431
00:26:32,039 --> 00:26:35,600
and I just see this by Louis actually
dissect me

432
00:26:35,600 --> 00:26:39,059
minus bring at is this wanted upset with
me

433
00:26:39,059 --> 00:26:42,749
upset between sexyy and bring at inside
let

434
00:26:42,749 --> 00:26:46,119
in inside Lipsy cell us

435
00:26:46,119 --> 00:26:49,519
because we know that the upset be on
weight con

436
00:26:49,519 --> 00:26:53,090
on Sunday and

437
00:26:53,090 --> 00:26:56,450
at the and actually what we do is I

438
00:26:56,450 --> 00:27:00,249
we this one is is though the value to me

439
00:27:00,249 --> 00:27:04,970
bring at because because you see in this
one we had to get get less something at

440
00:27:04,970 --> 00:27:08,119
EDP somebody'll I'll up

441
00:27:08,119 --> 00:27:12,419
a beep beep some a value is why I dread
which ECS value

442
00:27:12,419 --> 00:27:17,019
so what we do actually East yet we'll
with this value

443
00:27:17,019 --> 00:27:20,289
and eat BP we

444
00:27:20,289 --> 00:27:23,840
lost witness value and its value
actually to bring at

445
00:27:23,840 --> 00:27:27,129
got address a-minus this one because

446
00:27:27,129 --> 00:27:30,419
basically don't gotta get we have is at
something like this

447
00:27:30,419 --> 00:27:34,239
we have till upset so basically

448
00:27:34,239 --> 00:27:37,529
after this one I'll we actually

449
00:27:37,529 --> 00:27:40,769
got get up the the

450
00:27:40,769 --> 00:27:43,979
no got entry up bring at actually will
be

451
00:27:43,979 --> 00:27:47,239
at this value so one at this value is

452
00:27:47,239 --> 00:27:50,259
become at prep up its s the

453
00:27:50,259 --> 00:27:54,659
in the library

454
00:27:54,659 --> 00:27:58,529
and the other way to do that he does but
not be dereferencing

455
00:27:58,529 --> 00:28:01,840
so into not overwriting in the bravest

456
00:28:01,840 --> 00:28:06,399
like actually we actually overwrite up
the entry of bring at today

457
00:28:06,399 --> 00:28:09,590
the so in case we don't want to do that

458
00:28:09,590 --> 00:28:14,200
weekend rezone dynamic Lee and we just
jumbled up

459
00:28:14,200 --> 00:28:17,590
that locations or suspect could be late
lot upset

460
00:28:17,590 --> 00:28:20,840
with is you know less a day the system
and

461
00:28:20,840 --> 00:28:24,479
SAP bring at looked upset that one the
requester

462
00:28:24,479 --> 00:28:27,840
I at that previous though we demand the
location

463
00:28:27,840 --> 00:28:31,799
up to bring it got entry then what have
that value

464
00:28:31,799 --> 00:28:35,389
you can't just jump I'll call that nigga
I

465
00:28:35,389 --> 00:28:38,549
for example your natal have something
lost three star

466
00:28:38,549 --> 00:28:42,049
at biggest and John so this one place
and what is one

467
00:28:42,049 --> 00:28:45,820
is up BB act

468
00:28:45,820 --> 00:28:50,029
%eh and PBS and you can look that the
value in

469
00:28:50,029 --> 00:28:53,080
then hears you have some let's say EA's

470
00:28:53,080 --> 00:28:56,158
into that whatever up

471
00:28:56,159 --> 00:28:59,899
the value inside this memory location
%eh so now he s

472
00:28:59,899 --> 00:29:03,549
contend at Red of whatever up

473
00:29:03,549 --> 00:29:07,259
about Lipsy function you want to rezone

474
00:29:07,259 --> 00:29:10,460
and the last finger returning to like
corn yes

475
00:29:10,460 --> 00:29:16,600
Jim something like that

476
00:29:16,600 --> 00:29:19,629
Faisalabad is one example of like to be
here the

477
00:29:19,629 --> 00:29:24,340
need referencing on differing at the SAP
so it's quite the same way

478
00:29:24,340 --> 00:29:28,249
up bravest sample SF that and other
things

479
00:29:28,249 --> 00:29:32,759
we actually corn yes is that up corn
don't bring it got

480
00:29:32,759 --> 00:29:36,749
entry so in this debate dancing bring it
got entries

481
00:29:36,749 --> 00:29:40,119
you this is inspect that mean we don't
modified

482
00:29:40,119 --> 00:29:43,129
override got entry up bring at but which

483
00:29:43,129 --> 00:29:46,350
just Rezound a trip up essay

484
00:29:46,350 --> 00:29:51,369
the based on Dell current address
opinion

485
00:29:51,369 --> 00:29:54,889
so the question up on a piece is what
he'd availability

486
00:29:54,889 --> 00:29:57,999
up bill got many tualatin got get

487
00:29:57,999 --> 00:30:02,229
I so actually

488
00:30:02,229 --> 00:30:05,450
days is a viable in a story

489
00:30:05,450 --> 00:30:08,710
function which is generated by GCC
compiler

490
00:30:08,710 --> 00:30:12,009
are so weak mean any program to comply
with gcc

491
00:30:12,009 --> 00:30:15,659
this thing will be other a viable so we
do have

492
00:30:15,659 --> 00:30:19,029
and up of got get it just like this and
up

493
00:30:19,029 --> 00:30:22,419
up get follow us dodo this past year old

494
00:30:22,419 --> 00:30:25,769
the for special up by a lot

495
00:30:25,769 --> 00:30:29,720
and is a viable in on up the binary
comply PCC

496
00:30:29,720 --> 00:30:33,479
is break the goat up by simple

497
00:30:33,479 --> 00:30:37,989
got over I think I'd get we can fight in
the eachother

498
00:30:37,989 --> 00:30:42,129
are some the saw our expansion and
contrast the

499
00:30:42,129 --> 00:30:46,279
saudis actually content and up thing for
us to use

500
00:30:46,279 --> 00:30:53,279
fall got the right thing and got David C

501
00:30:57,290 --> 00:31:00,678
so I mentioned before like this this one
in this

502
00:31:00,679 --> 00:31:03,679
sample actually up by double

503
00:31:03,679 --> 00:31:10,679
in something like this one on this one
so

504
00:31:13,670 --> 00:31:17,549
so I actually thought about that a lot
right week we don't need to have own up

505
00:31:17,549 --> 00:31:21,370
out be got get we don't care about that
what we GNE want to do is we want to

506
00:31:21,370 --> 00:31:22,740
have some wait the way

507
00:31:22,740 --> 00:31:26,500
to be writing as with a practical and is

508
00:31:26,500 --> 00:31:29,980
reliable and is work in different across

509
00:31:29,980 --> 00:31:32,990
distribution anything like that and

510
00:31:32,990 --> 00:31:36,110
is not too much depend on on the binary
cell

511
00:31:36,110 --> 00:31:39,980
so that light we r we were talking about
bills

512
00:31:39,980 --> 00:31:43,080
sorry function indices easy way is
actually

513
00:31:43,080 --> 00:31:47,230
is let defended I mean I don't care
about what the program going

514
00:31:47,230 --> 00:31:50,470
because look at get is on way to Bible
individuals the

515
00:31:50,470 --> 00:31:53,880
in contrast function up Lipsy

516
00:31:53,880 --> 00:31:57,160
up the the series generated

517
00:31:57,160 --> 00:32:00,460
program %uh so actually we need

518
00:32:00,460 --> 00:32:03,590
on the feel up got get basically clean
it

519
00:32:03,590 --> 00:32:06,799
one lotteries get win it one other

520
00:32:06,799 --> 00:32:12,879
at sup memory and this one is optional
mean it's not necessary to have it

521
00:32:12,880 --> 00:32:16,309
but it days it days a viable something
like this

522
00:32:16,309 --> 00:32:20,830
and I we can omit marty's so basically
we only need

523
00:32:20,830 --> 00:32:24,090
on the few of I'll be got yet

524
00:32:24,090 --> 00:32:28,669
with his out because you'd you cannot
really I suspect that you have a lot of

525
00:32:28,669 --> 00:32:30,070
different things where you can do

526
00:32:30,070 --> 00:32:33,559
light be for the computation in the real

527
00:32:33,559 --> 00:32:37,980
up so because the thing is very
dependent on

528
00:32:37,980 --> 00:32:41,110
place civic I get thing like that so did
we

529
00:32:41,110 --> 00:32:44,350
the wait we doing actually we trying to
me my the number

530
00:32:44,350 --> 00:32:47,600
opera out the get just and up to
builders

531
00:32:47,600 --> 00:32:52,260
that 0 then

532
00:32:52,260 --> 00:32:55,260
up base on letting I just three cents a
week

533
00:32:55,260 --> 00:32:58,450
I was trying to try some other library
webid

534
00:32:58,450 --> 00:33:02,429
can do on out the mission of on kinda
thing we present beef also

535
00:33:02,429 --> 00:33:06,059
you know like couple let me know cut it
or not cutting let got all the right

536
00:33:06,059 --> 00:33:06,559
thing

537
00:33:06,559 --> 00:33:10,020
I like jet fighting out be got get

538
00:33:10,020 --> 00:33:13,760
and builder got overwriting Avery need
referencing and on Chi

539
00:33:13,760 --> 00:33:17,620
that Kathy actually will with that lot
of time to do manually

540
00:33:17,620 --> 00:33:20,910
so what we trying to do is we trying to
have some

541
00:33:20,910 --> 00:33:24,300
up tune where is get help to generate

542
00:33:24,300 --> 00:33:28,850
so followed re quite got get help you to
generate this that one play a lot

543
00:33:28,850 --> 00:33:35,480
has your eightieth this year they don't
and lost this planet solely

544
00:33:35,480 --> 00:33:39,679
calling it a return or ended split make
easy are so basically

545
00:33:39,679 --> 00:33:43,490
is have the funds a generated get condo
by a refund

546
00:33:43,490 --> 00:33:46,790
phone %uh

547
00:33:46,790 --> 00:33:50,309
library live ceasing like that and

548
00:33:50,309 --> 00:33:53,428
help you to be some upcoming light
things

549
00:33:53,429 --> 00:33:56,540
to help get the delay sir specific get

550
00:33:56,540 --> 00:33:59,700
something like that you 1 and is and

551
00:33:59,700 --> 00:34:02,840
have a generator to help you ultimate on
other things

552
00:34:02,840 --> 00:34:06,059
you net something like this one

553
00:34:06,059 --> 00:34:10,300
so we this one actually lemon face face
simple

554
00:34:10,300 --> 00:34:13,450
out the truth so it's not it because

555
00:34:13,449 --> 00:34:18,219
actually not like to have complicity
here and

556
00:34:18,220 --> 00:34:21,600
let school flooded

557
00:34:21,600 --> 00:34:28,580
trees so we have one

558
00:34:28,580 --> 00:34:35,580
one demostration order

559
00:34:45,829 --> 00:34:52,829
ok

560
00:34:56,710 --> 00:35:00,550
got my laptop has some problems I just
borrowed laptop

561
00:35:00,550 --> 00:35:04,000
solo just played

562
00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:08,580
at the door is that up and

563
00:35:08,580 --> 00:35:15,580
left the mall

564
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:44,980
so this one is and symbol of portable

565
00:35:44,980 --> 00:35:50,010
binary place basically just noting
simple one week tree copy

566
00:35:50,010 --> 00:35:53,250
this one

567
00:35:53,250 --> 00:35:56,560
is actually the system

568
00:35:56,560 --> 00:35:59,920
sell half and ice yes things like that

569
00:35:59,920 --> 00:36:03,750
however doe by resellers so

570
00:36:03,750 --> 00:36:06,970
this one demostration out up to

571
00:36:06,970 --> 00:36:11,130
out b-cell eaters simple thing where you
can do something

572
00:36:11,130 --> 00:36:14,330
generated gotta get for Lipsy binary

573
00:36:14,330 --> 00:36:20,500
searching for different things so we

574
00:36:20,500 --> 00:36:23,580
just this one it just in Devon a basic
night

575
00:36:23,580 --> 00:36:26,840
try tree like Jerry

576
00:36:26,840 --> 00:36:30,710
have used shifting for different things
week

577
00:36:30,710 --> 00:36:34,080
we thing that and up all building

578
00:36:34,080 --> 00:36:37,150
most things ready we don't to have
something that way

579
00:36:37,150 --> 00:36:44,150
complicated

580
00:36:48,949 --> 00:36:52,900
so here's assemble up to up to

581
00:36:52,900 --> 00:36:57,119
ice like it so up you see this one

582
00:36:57,119 --> 00:37:00,709
a symbol of hope you're right it's late
for that one using

583
00:37:00,709 --> 00:37:03,890
always so actually we have to fight on

584
00:37:03,890 --> 00:37:07,629
on library to do that solo

585
00:37:07,630 --> 00:37:10,650
you can see you can just like specify

586
00:37:10,650 --> 00:37:14,449
out be played something with the program
lives something like that

587
00:37:14,449 --> 00:37:18,549
and sorry

588
00:37:18,549 --> 00:37:22,439
and you can just say custom states that
is what actually can be ultimate

589
00:37:22,439 --> 00:37:27,428
as well but in case you want to specify
by yourself and put it days

590
00:37:27,429 --> 00:37:30,469
me is one actually done memory fine

591
00:37:30,469 --> 00:37:33,799
that say section on whatever rival

592
00:37:33,799 --> 00:37:37,249
memorization you want to use customs

593
00:37:37,249 --> 00:37:40,849
that I mentioned before %uh dan in the

594
00:37:40,849 --> 00:37:45,390
in the library is sellers already
provided on Kyle like got overwriting

595
00:37:45,390 --> 00:37:48,650
mention the fall all like trying to help
you

596
00:37:48,650 --> 00:37:51,789
to to build a suspect one a lot less a
set

597
00:37:51,789 --> 00:37:55,299
ya you I D all cone some up whatever

598
00:37:55,299 --> 00:37:58,479
function thing like that ready libraries

599
00:37:58,479 --> 00:38:03,920
so you can just use it self-assemble

600
00:38:03,920 --> 00:38:08,189
in the into I'll by Simone this one is
like to override a

601
00:38:08,189 --> 00:38:12,058
get who user ID a overwrite

602
00:38:12,059 --> 00:38:15,439
into the set I US you eighty

603
00:38:15,439 --> 00:38:18,529
on things so this one is a baller

604
00:38:18,529 --> 00:38:21,929
library already provided a way to build
a got overwriting

605
00:38:21,929 --> 00:38:26,819
know how sickly you build got writing
and collect anything like that

606
00:38:26,819 --> 00:38:31,029
that one own ultimate so you only need
to work on something like this

607
00:38:31,029 --> 00:38:34,170
is on by larry is cell

608
00:38:34,170 --> 00:38:38,489
then forbidding just that one was a
bonus that one what I want to do is the

609
00:38:38,489 --> 00:38:40,489
first thing I want to do like corn

610
00:38:40,489 --> 00:38:43,589
set I E UAB

611
00:38:43,589 --> 00:38:46,999
and make it into light nighty night

612
00:38:46,999 --> 00:38:50,529
-1 99 whatsoever sold I want said

613
00:38:50,529 --> 00:38:54,709
into nobody lets something like that all
may be 0 if you want them

614
00:38:54,709 --> 00:38:57,989
controlled thing that then

615
00:38:57,989 --> 00:39:02,150
funnest that one

616
00:39:02,150 --> 00:39:05,599
I can do the same thing for us that what
a like I do to

617
00:39:05,599 --> 00:39:08,779
the over I does set I

618
00:39:08,779 --> 00:39:12,140
you I D I see be far I i overwrite

619
00:39:12,140 --> 00:39:16,749
will get you you Eddie said I you ladies
are now I want to do over again

620
00:39:16,749 --> 00:39:20,849
wildlife onset I you lady into this one
I'll

621
00:39:20,849 --> 00:39:25,079
I say be. because in the state one I
want to called except the

622
00:39:25,079 --> 00:39:28,089
some program induced a a wonderful

623
00:39:28,089 --> 00:39:33,420
less a self-assembled let me is cells or
I'll what I can do I can say okay

624
00:39:33,420 --> 00:39:37,119
want to do got alright then next I want
to do this that

625
00:39:37,119 --> 00:39:40,519
SAP I get my region just like beads

626
00:39:40,519 --> 00:39:46,719
cell soul this one basically is how good
right as they tweak I'll

627
00:39:46,719 --> 00:39:51,219
library out the old so it may seem both
to do this Skype thing and

628
00:39:51,219 --> 00:39:54,920
ultimate most a fittingly complex and

629
00:39:54,920 --> 00:39:58,049
up to be and not this one weekend do the

630
00:39:58,049 --> 00:40:02,849
corn those generators up generators that
0

631
00:40:02,849 --> 00:40:06,239
and state line

632
00:40:06,239 --> 00:40:09,979
then just loves the program and out the
BB

633
00:40:09,979 --> 00:40:13,719
generate on out be a little want people
to think

634
00:40:13,719 --> 00:40:19,249
play trend put up a little and set up
the newsday

635
00:40:19,249 --> 00:40:23,299
about that so no does be done at the
mythical

636
00:40:23,299 --> 00:40:30,299
care about a

637
00:40:31,180 --> 00:40:36,029
so that when he dies late so now you can
just

638
00:40:36,030 --> 00:40:39,180
last with you every program and

639
00:40:39,180 --> 00:40:43,629
from

640
00:40:43,630 --> 00:40:50,630
here you can see sorry

641
00:41:01,579 --> 00:41:06,949
so this one is i in the border that the
butt thing

642
00:41:06,949 --> 00:41:10,839
so you can see more information so when
you read this one

643
00:41:10,839 --> 00:41:14,029
and libraries loading got get phone

644
00:41:14,029 --> 00:41:18,009
whatever's already generated are even
not level or Dennys

645
00:41:18,009 --> 00:41:25,009
tried generating get by itself and then

646
00:41:26,009 --> 00:41:29,209
is we're trying to build a state line is
this year they look

647
00:41:29,209 --> 00:41:32,759
and using the string copy function and
you see this one

648
00:41:32,759 --> 00:41:35,849
is generate among people opting copy

649
00:41:35,849 --> 00:41:41,269
thanks so the string copy multiple trick
up the line mentioned before Wed

650
00:41:41,269 --> 00:41:44,599
this year only trend for this that one
intruder

651
00:41:44,599 --> 00:41:47,609
include custom site saudis want me to
play

652
00:41:47,609 --> 00:41:51,959
generated up to do that so basically to
play don't like to upgrade

653
00:41:51,959 --> 00:41:56,058
at Red credit return address on this one
lay Kyle

654
00:41:56,059 --> 00:42:00,359
like chandy don't operate captains I
return to live sea captain but it's

655
00:42:00,359 --> 00:42:00,859
actually

656
00:42:00,859 --> 00:42:04,519
returned to the PO the entry invaded
noting copy

657
00:42:04,519 --> 00:42:08,239
and override at one using got
overwriting whatsoever make it becomes

658
00:42:08,239 --> 00:42:08,899
syncope

659
00:42:08,899 --> 00:42:12,308
so this one he just 80 a lot so
basically

660
00:42:12,309 --> 00:42:15,429
and its transferred among people saudis
this value

661
00:42:15,429 --> 00:42:18,759
is the you notice by the UAW up just
that one

662
00:42:18,759 --> 00:42:22,389
fail side one they need to train for or
not this value

663
00:42:22,389 --> 00:42:27,619
into into the newsday so basically land
mass and the fall

664
00:42:27,619 --> 00:42:30,630
we on searching for be fall into binary
so we know okay

665
00:42:30,630 --> 00:42:35,899
this a great place to be for also week
generating copy the copy desk be falling

666
00:42:35,899 --> 00:42:36,828
to Newsday

667
00:42:36,829 --> 00:42:40,929
and we set all okay what the neck by
nearly 85 something that's that

668
00:42:40,929 --> 00:42:44,959
and we said phone is showing and we long
get as possible

669
00:42:44,959 --> 00:42:48,328
so we fight update 3 by inside a binary
his cell

670
00:42:48,329 --> 00:42:52,339
I'll content is solely generated drink
%uh people

671
00:42:52,339 --> 00:42:59,339
the cuppy cuppy like that I so one is
done this one is just that

672
00:42:59,809 --> 00:43:02,880
0 a lot you see on accurate and thing

673
00:43:02,880 --> 00:43:06,059
return level here and this one is this
Euro

674
00:43:06,059 --> 00:43:09,529
then you see one is done

675
00:43:09,529 --> 00:43:12,859
actually set fully

676
00:43:12,859 --> 00:43:16,639
ice like it and you have a cell here

677
00:43:16,639 --> 00:43:19,959
week the user ID 99 ways

678
00:43:19,959 --> 00:43:23,169
in the into asleep before we mentioned
we actually though

679
00:43:23,169 --> 00:43:30,169
want to set I E you lady in 299

680
00:43:40,400 --> 00:43:43,320
so this another assemble easterly the

681
00:43:43,320 --> 00:43:46,740
up problem into CV to learn

682
00:43:46,740 --> 00:43:50,500
then trent the city savon soul

683
00:43:50,500 --> 00:43:54,910
his same boat so we just lay

684
00:43:54,910 --> 00:43:58,870
using at the end in stone lifted up to

685
00:43:58,870 --> 00:44:05,870
see about Evelyn in failure

686
00:44:09,370 --> 00:44:12,330
so if you see in this one we triangle

687
00:44:12,330 --> 00:44:15,690
as that regenerate we generate we have
it the

688
00:44:15,690 --> 00:44:20,270
using the library to generate defy when
you open that they fight week that

689
00:44:20,270 --> 00:44:24,130
week def I actually is slate but and
actually

690
00:44:24,130 --> 00:44:27,960
you see is rendered BC here this one
leader

691
00:44:27,960 --> 00:44:31,610
BC command me c:\program so we just

692
00:44:31,610 --> 00:44:34,850
tried do something like that I

693
00:44:34,850 --> 00:44:38,569
so as

694
00:44:38,570 --> 00:44:42,170
bodies one some of the libraries cell
septa

695
00:44:42,170 --> 00:44:45,260
the the got entry

696
00:44:45,260 --> 00:44:48,700
dry thing like that against look and
into

697
00:44:48,700 --> 00:44:52,640
in that thing they've got overwriting
kingsway

698
00:44:52,640 --> 00:44:56,750
do or nothing automatically follow for
you so you don't need to care

699
00:44:56,750 --> 00:45:00,250
well Playhouse you can't do that got
beat the referencing

700
00:45:00,250 --> 00:45:03,810
and for the live the no the

701
00:45:03,810 --> 00:45:07,560
last minute let yourself orderly paper
right is also

702
00:45:07,560 --> 00:45:11,750
estimate for this one is pretty simple
and saw at the same thing

703
00:45:11,750 --> 00:45:15,610
I don't got overwriting say me with naw

704
00:45:15,610 --> 00:45:19,100
get option something and you see

705
00:45:19,100 --> 00:45:22,580
privately is gone like BC after I

706
00:45:22,580 --> 00:45:26,230
in that the most rationing actually
render the

707
00:45:26,230 --> 00:45:29,720
be the calculate the command program

708
00:45:29,720 --> 00:45:32,720
when I opened that the

709
00:45:32,720 --> 00:45:36,890
fight generate that might be stone like
leaped on so

710
00:45:36,890 --> 00:45:40,580
you see is simple liked that one with
essay the this program

711
00:45:40,580 --> 00:45:44,000
and up I can do lies

712
00:45:44,000 --> 00:45:49,220
overwriting week doesn't ring drink a
combat veteran copies

713
00:45:49,220 --> 00:45:53,360
on same book is and you see

714
00:45:53,360 --> 00:45:56,620
the as it's basically just a few like
like this one and

715
00:45:56,620 --> 00:46:00,830
generate on up to chain read that the
Libyan out be

716
00:46:00,830 --> 00:46:05,069
that to do on cutting selecting

717
00:46:05,070 --> 00:46:09,110
I'm our of already saw is

718
00:46:09,110 --> 00:46:13,940
almost done as well Cup the measure

719
00:46:13,940 --> 00:46:18,380
soul out mythology actually doesn't work
with a PHD

720
00:46:18,380 --> 00:46:22,000
a however if you'll in some cases

721
00:46:22,000 --> 00:46:25,970
actually you can trying to profile the
play us Rep

722
00:46:25,970 --> 00:46:29,430
in possible is this oversight ways keep
saw

723
00:46:29,430 --> 00:46:32,649
of a new connection with me every time
still the same

724
00:46:32,650 --> 00:46:35,910
memory map soul you can do that and you
can prove thought

725
00:46:35,910 --> 00:46:39,440
the base threatened what you have to be
a threat you can apply the same

726
00:46:39,440 --> 00:46:42,940
thickness to do that and the PA's

727
00:46:42,940 --> 00:46:46,420
not is not widely adopted by and anyways

728
00:46:46,420 --> 00:46:51,280
a Ali use it some critical network
obligation

729
00:46:51,280 --> 00:46:56,170
we also support for the Mac OS but how
they make arrests

730
00:46:56,170 --> 00:46:59,890
must seem to because denied me

731
00:46:59,890 --> 00:47:03,400
logo here's your own way lot at the face
location

732
00:47:03,400 --> 00:47:06,820
in pocket reliable so they basically

733
00:47:06,820 --> 00:47:10,960
is a simple 30 days you still get
applied same

734
00:47:10,960 --> 00:47:14,220
metallurgy wastes that call this year
olds the road

735
00:47:14,220 --> 00:47:17,740
sequin up to date that fonda damnit
local

736
00:47:17,740 --> 00:47:20,750
cell and the second

737
00:47:20,750 --> 00:47:24,190
and you can do the most im jus lesson
like some small so

738
00:47:24,190 --> 00:47:28,420
got no dough and is that your choice got
so this wonderful

739
00:47:28,420 --> 00:47:31,740
assemble office a simple thing for them
make you less and his

740
00:47:31,740 --> 00:47:37,390
world but however it isn't just some try
things

741
00:47:37,390 --> 00:47:40,660
acting

742
00:47:40,660 --> 00:47:47,660
almost finished up so any question

743
00:48:02,600 --> 00:48:05,680
I was just asking have you released the
tool

744
00:48:05,680 --> 00:48:09,490
is it I think first generated

745
00:48:09,490 --> 00:48:12,680
on the website I'll

746
00:48:12,680 --> 00:48:16,350
the new version happen yet new versions

747
00:48:16,350 --> 00:48:23,350
pop OS keith is not any more questions

748
00:48:23,730 --> 00:48:27,170
I would say where actually only going
into the coffee break
