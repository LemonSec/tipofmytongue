public hazard

51
00:03:32,079 --> 00:03:35,329

like word list

56
00:03:49,699 --> 00:03:53,229
less with so for example janitor

57
00:03:53,229 --> 00:03:56,239
comfortable three thousand entries an
excellent

58
00:03:56,239 --> 00:03:59,590
make ways began with 100

59
00:03:59,590 --> 00:04:03,930
maybe you can't ignore list anywhere
from 10

60
00:04:03,930 --> 00:04:07,229
everyone and the janitor

61

62
00:04:12,310 --> 00:04:15,760
where either the rules from her turned
on me

63
00:04:15,760 --> 00:04:19,470
I wonder if shows when

64

so which that occurs at numbers

65
00:04:22,919 --> 00:04:26,190
punctuation I'm by default

66
00:04:26,190 --> 00:04:30,520
worthless doesn't mister

67
00:04:30,520 --> 00:04:34,159
notes let's try under re we have heard

68
00:04:34,160 --> 00:04:39,979

70
00:04:43,420 --> 00:04:49,270
again that's added

71
00:04:49,270 --> 00:04:53,000
using that word let's marry dictionaries
and it to do it

72
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:56,490
if you're tired security force

73
00:04:56,490 --> 00:05:00,120
like a you can be there for days

74
00:05:00,120 --> 00:05:03,180
I was worth stick

75
00:05:03,180 --> 00:05:08,010
much more experts much so

76
00:05:08,010 --> 00:05:11,010
something on experience I think mister

77
00:05:11,010 --> 00:05:15,590
I I don't know german also this
dictionary with somebody else

78
00:05:15,590 --> 00:05:19,280
apparently I'm

79
00:05:19,280 --> 00:05:22,780
in the city's there's a people i coming
to people's

80
00:05:22,780 --> 00:05:26,470
are very good for us the first time with
you was for

81
00:05:26,470 --> 00:05:30,450
the crack here we

82
00:05:30,450 --> 00:05:34,650
before his own want to be like things
through the dynamic

83
00:05:34,650 --> 00:05:38,600
and the same with actors and actresses
for

84
00:05:38,600 --> 00:05:41,970
it wasn't the greatest so we went to
check facebook

85
00:05:41,970 --> 00:05:46,080
see if Facebook which as you probably
heard

86
00:05:46,080 --> 00:05:50,030
that was it weren't for those names and
it became

87
00:05:50,030 --> 00:05:55,100
rather so what happened with a reporter
Mike

88
00:05:55,100 --> 00:05:58,590
here he saw eitan

89
00:05:58,590 --> 00:06:02,640
and he wrote about it before you got and
huge

90
00:06:02,640 --> 00:06:06,680
roadway sense that private compromised
records for Packer

91
00:06:06,680 --> 00:06:09,710
and I was story and other news outlets

92
00:06:09,710 --> 00:06:14,049
all itself the same thing but I'm next
to me

93
00:06:14,050 --> 00:06:17,930
and crackers story articulate I was
going

94
00:06:17,930 --> 00:06:22,050
people anyway

95
00:06:22,050 --> 00:06:25,080
pictures so I adjourned a couple from

96
00:06:25,080 --> 00:06:29,150
public documents what went on with we by
so

97
00:06:29,150 --> 00:06:32,810
I could pick caregivers employed by and
to Greece

98
00:06:32,810 --> 00:06:36,700
everywhere and mediation asked a couple
weekends

99
00:06:36,700 --> 00:06:42,060
a star chick was with the Collingwood

100
00:06:42,060 --> 00:06:45,740
with you the host people's Wikipedia is
that they give you

101
00:06:45,740 --> 00:06:50,340
the bill here they're all elections
smoke

102
00:06:50,340 --> 00:06:54,160
what's regrettable that is that correct
his fireside

103
00:06:54,160 --> 00:06:59,090
purpose of a smoker and you can just get
the actual for

104
00:06:59,090 --> 00:07:02,260
as I did for these other regions

105
00:07:02,260 --> 00:07:05,920
so the best collections is to use

106
00:07:05,920 --> 00:07:09,370
pictures which is so you can use it

107
00:07:09,370 --> 00:07:12,490
million our house her whatever passwords

108
00:07:12,490 --> 00:07:16,580
and that sucks so and after that

109
00:07:16,580 --> 00:07:19,859
yeah experience based on 34

110
00:07:19,860 --> 00:07:24,760
I driver modelers

111
00:07:24,760 --> 00:07:29,250
all the pictures and all the court
rejected throwing up

112
00:07:29,250 --> 00:07:33,430

115
00:07:41,810 --> 00:07:45,040
plaster the first in what used to crack
passwords

116
00:07:45,040 --> 00:07:48,220
here start yes Catholic

117
00:07:48,220 --> 00:07:51,700
5101 iconic

118
00:07:51,700 --> 00:07:54,760
I viewed and adult

119
00:07:54,760 --> 00:07:59,490
X you can also download the site of

120
00:07:59,490 --> 00:08:02,490
get offer to them he gets

121
00:08:02,490 --> 00:08:06,660
for one hour on works

122
00:08:06,660 --> 00:08:11,240
and effective so too thanks corners of
PB

123
00:08:11,240 --> 00:08:15,010
when they were so was it is so every

124
00:08:15,010 --> 00:08:18,430
every word everything and Davis

125
00:08:18,430 --> 00:08:21,650
was posted online and does it really
easy

126
00:08:21,650 --> 00:08:25,340
to cart here

127
00:08:25,340 --> 00:08:31,690
placement to territories

128
00:08:31,690 --> 00:08:35,440
so just a quick aside: which is look

129
00:08:35,440 --> 00:08:42,440
cars up

130
00:08:43,680 --> 00:08:50,680
for meters for prosecution

131
00:09:00,110 --> 00:09:03,150
it doesn't matter anyway the courtesies
of Christ

132
00:09:03,150 --> 00:09:06,730
and are on your part on my side and

133
00:09:06,730 --> 00:09:10,020
if you are interesting actors like
access at

134
00:09:10,020 --> 00:09:15,260
the problem databases on German

135
00:09:15,260 --> 00:09:18,689
I wonder so I prefers completely random

136
00:09:18,690 --> 00:09:21,820
thing here which me whatsoever

137
00:09:21,820 --> 00:09:25,410
I i havent to search for it

138
00:09:25,410 --> 00:09:29,100
pulses as well as the premises for

139
00:09:29,100 --> 00:09:32,940
form so if you want to take a look at
that

140
00:09:32,940 --> 00:09:36,390
and if you want coming with talk

141
00:09:36,390 --> 00:09:39,689
that the promises of programmers I'm

142
00:09:39,690 --> 00:09:42,800
so I don't week ago

143
00:09:42,800 --> 00:09:45,830
the general public -4

144
00:09:45,830 --> 00:09:49,690

compact spare

145
00:09:49,690 --> 00:09:53,580
members so charismatic

146
00:09:53,580 --> 00:09:56,650
for the moment so

147
00:09:56,650 --> 00:10:00,130

together and equipment with don't

150
00:10:13,920 --> 00:10:20,180
so few search for hazards

151
00:10:20,180 --> 00:10:27,180

myspace I think that's comprised in
about 2006 players

163
00:11:19,200 --> 00:11:23,890
attack because a phishing attacks all as
indicator

164

attacked Saugatuck

167
00:11:34,540 --> 00:11:37,849
aspirins thoroughness you which

168
00:11:37,850 --> 00:11:40,910
toxic fish but in addition

169
00:11:40,910 --> 00:11:46,459
pass from one of the most common ABC 123
second so on the thing about

170
00:11:46,460 --> 00:11:49,750
Mike that requires a similar password

171
00:11:49,750 --> 00:11:54,370
so that's why every week number one I'm
so

172
00:11:54,370 --> 00:11:57,490
eggs account like this was unheard

173
00:11:57,490 --> 00:12:00,960
reach I seventy-five his password course

174
00:12:00,960 --> 00:12:05,130
the first thing we do that we saw top 10
list first-hand

175
00:12:05,130 --> 00:12:08,939
every password something ask for one the
second thing we did was

176
00:12:08,940 --> 00:12:12,700
we use the stereotype because at the
time analysts from

177
00:12:12,700 --> 00:12:16,540
your statistics up

178
00:12:16,540 --> 00:12:21,160
legacy I basically just and be fired

179
00:12:21,160 --> 00:12:26,089
truck best so 34 percent battery simple
things

180
00:12:26,090 --> 00:12:29,380
up

181
00:12:29,380 --> 00:12:33,240
crafts I'm be posting this talk to
Twitter and Skype

182
00:12:33,240 --> 00:12:36,950
what's little if you wanna go through
detailed 3

183
00:12:36,950 --> 00:12:41,510
I think with PCB and this was the second
biggest

184
00:12:41,510 --> 00:12:44,900
comfortable I'm up to this week

185
00:12:44,900 --> 00:12:48,070
apparently this there's finally passes
for around somewhere

186
00:12:48,070 --> 00:12:51,370
that mean I kinda albums

187
00:12:51,370 --> 00:12:55,500
biggest everything help

188
00:12:55,500 --> 00:12:58,800
the piece you gave us when exposed
contact and

189
00:12:58,800 --> 00:13:01,840
this was done when you're go

190
00:13:01,840 --> 00:13:05,580
a check but

191
00:13:05,580 --> 00:13:09,060
since then my friends has not stopped
right across from it

192
00:13:09,060 --> 00:13:12,650
and he's basically

193
00:13:12,650 --> 00:13:16,490
obsessed but his his car .2 percent

194
00:13:16,490 --> 00:13:21,880
aspects which is all he said that when I
was crack

195
00:13:21,880 --> 00:13:25,750
dysphoric but they were in the past

196
00:13:25,750 --> 00:13:30,120
clean up the fight easy tax crack
passwords

197
00:13:30,120 --> 00:13:34,740
like I said earlier and if I I was my

198
00:13:34,740 --> 00:13:37,940
afterwards ok up

199
00:13:37,940 --> 00:13:41,840
there for talking to us with

200
00:13:41,840 --> 00:13:45,600
with this much more typical we 1356

201
00:13:45,600 --> 00:13:51,340
password the famous officers will again

202
00:13:51,340 --> 00:13:57,290
that's not as fuck to people UBS's a
long morning

203
00:13:57,290 --> 00:14:00,579
free for Picasa humans

204
00:14:00,580 --> 00:14:03,960
20 everything this works about Oct

205
00:14:03,960 --> 00:14:07,930
works this is the first reactor expired

206
00:14:07,930 --> 00:14:11,450
socal forty ask released on the actual
site

207
00:14:11,450 --> 00:14:15,850
this is for the Lok once and the reason
for that is major

208
00:14:15,850 --> 00:14:19,350
as is basis it works best for tax
evasion recovers

209
00:14:19,350 --> 00:14:23,010
whether specific Star Trek or two games
worked with her

210
00:14:23,010 --> 00:14:26,590
apiece to use a very general site so the
passwords

211
00:14:26,590 --> 00:14:33,100
work with a report thurmond's rocking up

212
00:14:33,100 --> 00:14:36,110
a rocky was a big beautiful time for so

213
00:14:36,110 --> 00:14:39,870
its third with only ass was released
Astro

214
00:14:39,870 --> 00:14:43,110
text my understanding is that this was
released by

215
00:14:43,110 --> 00:14:47,240
sequence action I that but

216
00:14:47,240 --> 00:14:50,590
this is the basis for as for this now
because

217
00:14:50,590 --> 00:14:54,650
its if you're research one single
password for each

218
00:14:54,650 --> 00:14:58,780
the one huge and its plain text you can

219
00:14:58,780 --> 00:15:02,920
all the top three passes a world where

220
00:15:02,920 --> 00:15:07,150
I followed by a pastor at excess I
rocket was often with

221
00:15:07,150 --> 00:15:13,990
well which again people use I'm
forty-one percent has to be some

222
00:15:13,990 --> 00:15:14,700
people's names

223
00:15:14,700 --> 00:15:17,950
again that's pretty

224
00:15:17,950 --> 00:15:21,670
pre hiker his words contender

225
00:15:21,670 --> 00:15:25,550
words different at 23 persons car

226
00:15:25,550 --> 00:15:30,010
Star Trek equal months with and this is
a sport

227
00:15:30,010 --> 00:15:33,050
invest exercises

228
00:15:33,050 --> 00:15:37,740
and forgiveness like

229
00:15:37,740 --> 00:15:44,740
and thats last week

230
00:15:50,680 --> 00:15:56,430
yep

231
00:15:56,430 --> 00:15:59,580
yes so the question was how do we have
to read

232
00:15:59,580 --> 00:16:04,140
ask me things so when it was a
eventually spokane is behind us

233
00:16:04,140 --> 00:16:07,400
things after the first left individually

234
00:16:07,400 --> 00:16:11,040
and Iran John rules so it basically

235
00:16:11,040 --> 00:16:14,050
at 1 yes the STN

236
00:16:14,050 --> 00:16:18,670
the cap every person something like that
so 200 civilians

237
00:16:18,670 --> 00:16:21,740
became welcome to come so it was a very

238
00:16:21,740 --> 00:16:25,060
as wannabes this list is a well

239
00:16:25,060 --> 00:16:28,210
his it's just very very there's also

240
00:16:28,210 --> 00:16:31,960
so this

241
00:16:31,960 --> 00:16:35,800
foresight her people Mac

242
00:16:35,800 --> 00:16:39,370
so this is defense workers Barack

243
00:16:39,370 --> 00:16:43,880
for comprise maybe within the last six
months or so

244
00:16:43,880 --> 00:16:48,200
and I'm not sure how it works my
understanding is that the past

245
00:16:48,200 --> 00:16:51,700
were found peace some support and

246
00:16:51,700 --> 00:16:54,810
people years on from there plus

247
00:16:54,810 --> 00:16:58,340
as everybody thinks there's no cash

248
00:16:58,340 --> 00:17:03,020
where and it's actually aldrich it's
interesting because it's

249
00:17:03,020 --> 00:17:07,290
anonymous reach for the white house

250
00:17:07,290 --> 00:17:10,450
self today the National Fish

251
00:17:10,450 --> 00:17:16,300
thank God I'm for the last four
passwords

252
00:17:16,300 --> 00:17:19,460
I use google translate to bigger the
actual

253
00:17:19,460 --> 00:17:25,110
passwords were Kaka like winter and the
check was released the Google where

254
00:17:25,110 --> 00:17:28,440
kuhen by I think this is the play we
think swear words

255
00:17:28,440 --> 00:17:32,030
so my impression is that the their

256
00:17:32,030 --> 00:17:36,370
for talking asks where words talk
probably a few nope

257
00:17:36,370 --> 00:17:40,420
things like this one for QA eighty
percent

258
00:17:40,420 --> 00:17:44,110
as well work basically means about

259
00:17:44,110 --> 00:17:48,580
a quarter them factors at work John
which is actually pretty good

260
00:17:48,580 --> 00:17:53,659
for those senators 62 percent

261
00:17:53,660 --> 00:17:57,140
PCB Iraqi people

262
00:17:57,140 --> 00:18:00,490
for sent by spider this from got over
sixty percent

263
00:18:00,490 --> 00:18:05,010
30 because the specific site so its it's
just physically

264
00:18:05,010 --> 00:18:09,110
which that helps a lot and has a
specific purpose

265
00:18:09,110 --> 00:18:13,260
two people were we look

266
00:18:13,260 --> 00:18:17,120
next month

267
00:18:17,120 --> 00:18:20,800
scriptures because while I was working
for free

268
00:18:20,800 --> 00:18:24,909
produce like I came across a different
list

269
00:18:24,910 --> 00:18:28,380
which world his passwords but was
dismissed

270
00:18:28,380 --> 00:18:33,100
and mister 31 to be exact have has our
story for the points

271
00:18:33,100 --> 00:18:36,100
a plain text me five as you want

272
00:18:36,100 --> 00:18:39,520
30 sometimes when thanks

273
00:18:39,520 --> 00:18:42,850
some 24 of

274
00:18:42,850 --> 00:18:46,970
this it allows you to use all persons
peacekeepers

275
00:18:46,970 --> 00:18:50,010
but doesn't hurt to ask for a week
personalities is like

276
00:18:50,010 --> 00:18:53,780
to any user to create account when using
text passwords

277
00:18:53,780 --> 00:18:57,170
endeavored create new accounts the
fastest

278
00:18:57,170 --> 00:19:00,980
fixed was interesting with this

279
00:19:00,980 --> 00:19:04,850
is out to see how much more capacity
with all the persons of it

280
00:19:04,850 --> 00:19:08,460
so we really we worked on this for both
six months maybe

281
00:19:08,460 --> 00:19:11,950
week under both require them all the
passwords

282
00:19:11,950 --> 00:19:15,790
and a half points Andrew speed we're
back

283
00:19:15,790 --> 00:19:19,340
the others were the ones that a couple
trillion second

284
00:19:19,340 --> 00:19:24,689
and salt water kayak soap

285
00:19:24,690 --> 00:19:29,400
asked again at the paper for class was
the first one 3

286
00:19:29,400 --> 00:19:33,340
potholes where 3 doesn't want to
krissi001

287
00:19:33,340 --> 00:19:39,629
Beach USA we weren't sure what was the
first witness research on and it turns

288
00:19:39,630 --> 00:19:41,240
out that there's some specific

289
00:19:41,240 --> 00:19:45,860
software for deposits back forms and
that suffer has occurred

290
00:19:45,860 --> 00:19:49,690
so its current

291
00:19:49,690 --> 00:19:55,590
the 26 contrast spare so

292
00:19:55,590 --> 00:19:58,980
here's kinda distribution the passwords
via

293
00:19:58,980 --> 00:20:02,400
the crack this was cracked decently but
not very well

294
00:20:02,400 --> 00:20:05,940
you can see the poorest ones were the
English major stated

295
00:20:05,940 --> 00:20:09,090
percent and the US cities in the Bible
heard

296
00:20:09,090 --> 00:20:13,560
this for this again is because this from
inside and I switched

297
00:20:13,560 --> 00:20:17,399
but they were

298
00:20:17,400 --> 00:20:21,030
being the starting point so

299
00:20:21,030 --> 00:20:24,410
the next responsible for this once
papers the Christian

300
00:20:24,410 --> 00:20:28,290
books as for office comments Cox so

301
00:20:28,290 --> 00:20:31,450
the bridge as far as I understand it was
due to extra problems

302
00:20:31,450 --> 00:20:34,820
so people were go to the user

303
00:20:34,820 --> 00:20:38,820
or whatever maybe if you like and as I

304
00:20:38,820 --> 00:20:43,800
people's 30 to you first and when you
get this deformation

305
00:20:43,800 --> 00:20:47,500
because you can also you the password
test captaincy

306
00:20:47,500 --> 00:20:50,780
sax control and as such Chan obviously
ask

307
00:20:50,780 --> 00:20:53,790
user sold over the biggest

308
00:20:53,790 --> 00:20:58,750
up somebody I really want that to happen
there's a lot of people

309
00:20:58,750 --> 00:21:02,360
we're posting Facebook account

310
00:21:02,360 --> 00:21:05,700
accounts peacefulness somebody stop

311
00:21:05,700 --> 00:21:10,250
asks to interestingly what is a
respected figure out

312
00:21:10,250 --> 00:21:13,660
West with us stop I found out that the
admins

313
00:21:13,660 --> 00:21:17,080
denied whatever happened and when
because

314
00:21:17,080 --> 00:21:20,100
evidence secures the past month the
contracts as well

315
00:21:20,100 --> 00:21:24,160
we've got to fix the issues injured I
guess the only other

316
00:21:24,160 --> 00:21:29,950
these patterns on multiple sites so

317
00:21:29,950 --> 00:21:33,730
I was gonna the top passers the first 56

318
00:21:33,730 --> 00:21:38,710
and this was blank the section weblinks
words the next one summer's going to

319
00:21:38,710 --> 00:21:39,160
Meijer

320
00:21:39,160 --> 00:21:44,030
so writer go back

321
00:21:44,030 --> 00:21:47,590
and uses one explicit John 3:16

322
00:21:47,590 --> 00:21:52,929
he's always experts I was casually a
good

323
00:21:52,930 --> 00:21:56,920
resort and has worked really well

324
00:21:56,920 --> 00:21:59,980
I'm over

325
00:21:59,980 --> 00:22:04,010
means about 3 percent based on english
words

326
00:22:04,010 --> 00:22:08,910
the market suffered and this is when the
best was about to

327
00:22:08,910 --> 00:22:12,710
at the one with the bike so

328
00:22:12,710 --> 00:22:17,200
its kinda track

329
00:22:17,200 --> 00:22:21,100
with the worker it was constantly

330
00:22:21,100 --> 00:22:24,650
if you used to Chicago for accounts you
can view the profile

331
00:22:24,650 --> 00:22:28,090
act business

332
00:22:28,090 --> 00:22:31,590
they're jumping castles third

333
00:22:31,590 --> 00:22:38,090
16 and have religious uses

334
00:22:38,090 --> 00:22:41,310
thanks and here's here's a look

335
00:22:41,310 --> 00:22:44,399
business card very so sixty percent

336
00:22:44,400 --> 00:22:48,180
fragments from names about 35 percent

337
00:22:48,180 --> 00:22:52,060
this works democrats researcher both
very well

338
00:22:52,060 --> 00:22:56,700
at the Olympics John take

339
00:22:56,700 --> 00:23:00,880
two more 31 possible possible to go
faster

340
00:23:00,880 --> 00:23:04,670
published and this is just released
about to its gonna

341
00:23:04,670 --> 00:23:09,520
so it was coming months injection his
passenger plane text

342
00:23:09,520 --> 00:23:14,250
things the name of pop at Worcester

343
00:23:14,250 --> 00:23:18,160
so is Mike

344
00:23:18,160 --> 00:23:23,240
there's no looks like things here
because his country overall

345
00:23:23,240 --> 00:23:27,300
to to much support well do research in
this one

346
00:23:27,300 --> 00:23:31,780
I was looking for as used stumble upon
another dictionary

347
00:23:31,780 --> 00:23:36,980
was basically house point and reason of
birds because

348
00:23:36,980 --> 00:23:40,610
the top last where is a few

349
00:23:40,610 --> 00:23:43,970
where they did pussy xxx

350
00:23:43,970 --> 00:23:47,740
my stick

351
00:23:47,740 --> 00:23:51,370
these were the cracks well because

352
00:23:51,370 --> 00:23:55,680
much the most interesting to point out
here is that that that that was a BBC

353
00:23:55,680 --> 00:23:56,760
the Bible

354
00:23:56,760 --> 00:24:00,080
incredible percent up for tour insights
the card percent

355
00:24:00,080 --> 00:24:04,990
the site so up

356
00:24:04,990 --> 00:24:08,520
I i cant figure out how to unlock yet
grassroots

357
00:24:08,520 --> 00:24:14,110
fourth I'm never did and couples

358
00:24:14,110 --> 00:24:19,010
so I worked on those cars SEC I we
simply must recognize patterns

359
00:24:19,010 --> 00:24:23,090
and we got sixty percent at their solid

360
00:24:23,090 --> 00:24:27,610
as I said earlier there's a lifeguard

361
00:24:27,610 --> 00:24:31,070
its own terms nurtured interest

362
00:24:31,070 --> 00:24:36,320
freud's suck

363
00:24:36,320 --> 00:24:40,070
so if you got stronger

364
00:24:40,070 --> 00:24:43,270
next ones I think its holder the fifth
one

365
00:24:43,270 --> 00:24:46,460
after without me parents were

366
00:24:46,460 --> 00:24:50,090
good and another got through that

367
00:24:50,090 --> 00:24:53,360
quirks password I'd look quite pleased

368
00:24:53,360 --> 00:24:57,070
the keyboard Germany happens at what's

369
00:24:57,070 --> 00:25:01,639
canister a little bit too easily
passwords

370
00:25:01,640 --> 00:25:04,780
one thing that you're actually that one
of the trends that

371
00:25:04,780 --> 00:25:08,200
people often use passwords for two
numbers

372
00:25:08,200 --> 00:25:12,550
and those numbers are you therefore I
was born in 83 so much Mike

373
00:25:12,550 --> 00:25:16,840
hello 83 we talk to her thesis like

374
00:25:16,840 --> 00:25:21,260
that were you like cologne 93 or 94
where these people are probably fifteen

375
00:25:21,260 --> 00:25:22,270
sixteen years old

376
00:25:22,270 --> 00:25:26,450
their tree scared

377
00:25:26,450 --> 00:25:30,230
so this one some going to be

378
00:25:30,230 --> 00:25:33,600
like that I just go ahead with the
German experienced

379
00:25:33,600 --> 00:25:37,020
sticks which is not a surprise

380
00:25:37,020 --> 00:25:41,220
but it was a little surprising german
taxpayers want has been getting this one

381
00:25:41,220 --> 00:25:44,890
because apparent wordsworth experts

382
00:25:44,890 --> 00:25:49,560
the site itself was I yep a high school
days

383
00:25:49,560 --> 00:25:53,179
I'm a worthless piece from activist like
years old

384
00:25:53,180 --> 00:25:56,650
and those perfect over

385
00:25:56,650 --> 00:26:00,680
unicycle may be scrapped

386
00:26:00,680 --> 00:26:04,210
so groups like yesterday because I was
talking to me on twitter

387
00:26:04,210 --> 00:26:07,570
how many aka I mean as russians of
interaction

388
00:26:07,570 --> 00:26:11,010
because and with toxicity some a
password and David

389
00:26:11,010 --> 00:26:14,129
usually hashed it turns out

390
00:26:14,130 --> 00:26:17,230
both said that at work kleenex

391
00:26:17,230 --> 00:26:20,570
these far looks like I'm not sure what
they were done

392
00:26:20,570 --> 00:26:23,929
at my sis house perfect so we don't know
how the rash

393
00:26:23,930 --> 00:26:27,760
the rest of this week at the three that
were

394
00:26:27,760 --> 00:26:32,100
cash or yet through a rough patch a 175

395
00:26:32,100 --> 00:26:37,230
one was held at sixty-one and one with
all the about

396
00:26:37,230 --> 00:26:41,220
the success rate with the md5 password
thanks sent successfully with assault

397
00:26:41,220 --> 00:26:43,390
asterisk

398
00:26:43,390 --> 00:26:47,070
ok just

399
00:26:47,070 --> 00:26:50,090
he's got sick muscle groups ago

400
00:26:50,090 --> 00:26:53,840
too much it's basically summary which
passed best

401
00:26:53,840 --> 00:26:57,300
I was a little more interesting so the
navy's

402
00:26:57,300 --> 00:27:00,530
the first column big passwords almost
overall

403
00:27:00,530 --> 00:27:04,530
the to wikis cracked passwords

404
00:27:04,530 --> 00:27:07,700
your company's cities wassup

405
00:27:07,700 --> 00:27:11,140
much so overall I think the best thing

406
00:27:11,140 --> 00:27:16,170
34 percent and like I said them to the
biggest

407
00:27:16,170 --> 00:27:19,470
fluent things were simple

408
00:27:19,470 --> 00:27:23,010
buyer wikis big deal

409
00:27:23,010 --> 00:27:26,320
and with his through to do so well
because they have specific terms and I'm

410
00:27:26,320 --> 00:27:30,899
just because everybody's water English
words on them

411
00:27:30,900 --> 00:27:37,860
I'm screaming sex very good it really
depends on

412
00:27:37,860 --> 00:27:41,160
misconduct 3 the card and Wed

413
00:27:41,160 --> 00:27:43,590
once respective ways

414
00:27:43,590 --> 00:27:48,350
the first ones where I took to this
year's event PHP

415
00:27:48,350 --> 00:27:52,190
rock the biggest ones and I tried
different dictionaries

416
00:27:52,190 --> 00:27:55,670
with specific rules 17 only

417
00:27:55,670 --> 00:27:59,390
against and feeling and

418
00:27:59,390 --> 00:28:02,880
following that it's Greg I just look for
guidance complex

419
00:28:02,880 --> 00:28:06,670
outward and the number never work soak

420
00:28:06,670 --> 00:28:09,700
brothers for experts

421
00:28:09,700 --> 00:28:14,010
75 like just number for the password
having to send a happy

422
00:28:14,010 --> 00:28:17,330
after we speak passwords

423
00:28:17,330 --> 00:28:21,840
so with that so drunk resort

424
00:28:21,840 --> 00:28:25,440
which was all so looks like

425
00:28:25,440 --> 00:28:30,390
Germany but it's going ok

426
00:28:30,390 --> 00:28:33,920
there's more research companies for
designer this

427
00:28:33,920 --> 00:28:39,070
pullover these rules so

428
00:28:39,070 --> 00:28:43,030
the first time rules up all the
workplace first because I'm X

429
00:28:43,030 --> 00:28:46,899
for scores of cases with I don't want to
be in

430
00:28:46,900 --> 00:28:51,330
reversing and it was the beginning
capitalistic

431
00:28:51,330 --> 00:28:54,620
so those are your thoughts on this image
well

432
00:28:54,620 --> 00:28:57,920
that the best customers are all lower
case doesn't like

433
00:28:57,920 --> 00:29:01,410
the second-best passwords are peaceful
and one

434
00:29:01,410 --> 00:29:05,760
and the next one is next one is

435
00:29:05,760 --> 00:29:08,960
all first-half performance and the rest

436
00:29:08,960 --> 00:29:13,210
you can see a graph that all the work
spaces governments

437
00:29:13,210 --> 00:29:17,350
87 using this word also

438
00:29:17,350 --> 00:29:22,590
for dictionaries using just export so

439
00:29:22,590 --> 00:29:26,370
using your wake up for them across from

440
00:29:26,370 --> 00:29:29,770
just letters about half passwords

441
00:29:29,770 --> 00:29:33,910
rock both just likes the next one or

442
00:29:33,910 --> 00:29:37,110
players an excellent for his letters
following two digits

443
00:29:37,110 --> 00:29:40,310
for all there was Oliver's

444
00:29:40,310 --> 00:29:43,899
for work with its miscarriages act
wanted to be better

445
00:29:43,900 --> 00:29:48,610
actually one digit the next his where

446
00:29:48,610 --> 00:29:52,860
your got

447
00:29:52,860 --> 00:29:56,220
so you can see again just all letters
going scrap

448
00:29:56,220 --> 00:29:59,420
to the numeric passwords

449
00:29:59,420 --> 00:30:03,300
the majority people used to scare
grassroots their owners

450
00:30:03,300 --> 00:30:07,250
the river numbers are 36 members and I
was the one

451
00:30:07,250 --> 00:30:13,990
46 the second most common cause actual
its 479 up

452
00:30:13,990 --> 00:30:17,530
polar the common people use anywhere
between 10 candidates

453
00:30:17,530 --> 00:30:21,860
wanna go percent 3/2

454
00:30:21,860 --> 00:30:25,070
here's got books

455
00:30:25,070 --> 00:30:29,570
plus current the next topic

456
00:30:29,570 --> 00:30:34,000
coming to you numbers the and with
archives and numbers

457
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:37,680
so either here the most common law
students

458
00:30:37,680 --> 00:30:41,120
so password 12 for I wondered

459
00:30:41,120 --> 00:30:44,880
was jordan 23 and I don't know what to
expect

460
00:30:44,880 --> 00:30:48,820
it turns out michael Jordan from the end
Jersey 23

461
00:30:48,820 --> 00:30:53,010
sites 3 for so

462
00:30:53,010 --> 00:30:57,140
to the just the most common one 43 I

463
00:30:57,140 --> 00:31:01,110
God something icons that

464
00:31:01,110 --> 00:31:04,200
a local youth class xx asked

465
00:31:04,200 --> 00:31:09,550
so possible three possible for 2005 when
they graduate site from all the crap

466
00:31:09,550 --> 00:31:14,010
you look like and this is a test and
that's going to be a fairly

467
00:31:14,010 --> 00:31:17,440
with graph the most common one was
possible impossible 9

468
00:31:17,440 --> 00:31:21,450
and I that is

469
00:31:21,450 --> 00:31:25,070
if goes back to Casa

470
00:31:25,070 --> 00:31:29,530
76 X can surprise me so

471
00:31:29,530 --> 00:31:32,810
lost between us so

472
00:31:32,810 --> 00:31:36,149
I so English Dictionary added the
following transformations

473
00:31:36,150 --> 00:31:39,580
a tack

474
00:31:39,580 --> 00:31:42,750
cedar who can get for the most common

475
00:31:42,750 --> 00:31:46,860
3/3

476
00:31:46,860 --> 00:31:49,980
second most common I'm or 20 sacks most
common

477
00:31:49,980 --> 00:31:54,330
for why I one Israel help 1 so the
polymer

478
00:31:54,330 --> 00:31:57,480
passwords crack by just changing almost

479
00:31:57,480 --> 00:32:02,450
zeros in this work withhold third
perhaps every small number

480
00:32:02,450 --> 00:32:05,460
I just got looks like so

481
00:32:05,460 --> 00:32:09,390
all the right one is used most common
want to get out s

482
00:32:09,390 --> 00:32:13,430
two dollars I UPC of 0 the last few

483
00:32:13,430 --> 00:32:17,190
v2 flashbacks

484
00:32:17,190 --> 00:32:20,270
x2 them nobody's one person

485
00:32:20,270 --> 00:32:23,570
anarchic so

486
00:32:23,570 --> 00:32:26,830
I cook all the different please be
possible every

487
00:32:26,830 --> 00:32:30,470
every week and the car 2002 pp

488
00:32:30,470 --> 00:32:34,210
which is point percent owes a debt swap

489
00:32:34,210 --> 00:32:37,310
sorry a cargo .3 percent

490
00:32:37,310 --> 00:32:41,120
rock servers someone who could possibly
I just watched

491
00:32:41,120 --> 00:32:44,360
provide monophonic order Allegri

492
00:32:44,360 --> 00:32:47,430
hellfire I might never was probably the
second thoughts when

493
00:32:47,430 --> 00:32:50,730
degenerated because I just I texted to
replace

494
00:32:50,730 --> 00:32:54,860
these 30 I was supposed to be under this
cat

495
00:32:54,860 --> 00:32:58,110
chopsticks before hos into communion

496
00:32:58,110 --> 00:33:02,410
pretty press conference the promise
because it was funny

497
00:33:02,410 --> 00:33:05,610
this work ek fairly quickly

498
00:33:05,610 --> 00:33:09,010
do in every possible position is
pictured about two hours

499
00:33:09,010 --> 00:33:14,450
cops precast her your summer

500
00:33:14,450 --> 00:33:18,980
defeated in the John so it's a go 21
Ruby

501
00:33:18,980 --> 00:33:22,240
as 36 one thing that

502
00:33:22,240 --> 00:33:25,630
since I've been here Austria those
actualization

503
00:33:25,630 --> 00:33:29,870
striker Nicolas to halls with the two
dots on it defects

504
00:33:29,870 --> 00:33:32,980
see how it works axes asked but

505
00:33:32,980 --> 00:33:36,050
maybe next time so

506
00:33:36,050 --> 00:33:39,770
service I'm plain english words lower
case

507
00:33:39,770 --> 00:33:43,400
cracked passwords why I think

508
00:33:43,400 --> 00:33:46,700
2 percent and capital acid card

509
00:33:46,700 --> 00:33:51,010
1.4 percent all the passwords credit was
0.04 percent

510
00:33:51,010 --> 00:33:54,290
so almost experts but the magnetism

511
00:33:54,290 --> 00:33:57,810
acted very difficult sweet week

512
00:33:57,810 --> 00:34:01,120
we speak almanac cracks

513
00:34:01,120 --> 00:34:04,370
once at ameritech

514
00:34:04,370 --> 00:34:07,470
by

515
00:34:07,470 --> 00:34:11,050
the heart arrests were all a pic and
Outback Bowl

516
00:34:11,050 --> 00:34:14,540
to the Jets won this report its are the
most common

517
00:34:14,540 --> 00:34:18,250
password number students

518
00:34:18,250 --> 00:34:21,730
so a few minutes misspelled words

519
00:34:21,730 --> 00:34:25,960
from my has a lot of work I ask

520
00:34:25,960 --> 00:34:29,020
you have to stop hero scholar

521
00:34:29,020 --> 00:34:32,560
for human beings dictionary his fiscal
program which'll

522
00:34:32,560 --> 00:34:36,620
switch euthanize another 6 I'll see that
pic

523
00:34:36,620 --> 00:34:40,330
or trucker and see the cracks

524
00:34:40,330 --> 00:34:43,330
so what would you do with you driver
request

525
00:34:43,330 --> 00:34:47,219
that you stand out type that speller I
got next week

526
00:34:47,220 --> 00:34:50,470
impact that back John and you have

527
00:34:50,470 --> 00:34:53,480
yours week

528
00:34:53,480 --> 00:34:57,000
another common coming out of bounds with
other languages

529
00:34:57,000 --> 00:35:00,800
so taking Chinese Japanese up

530
00:35:00,800 --> 00:35:04,180
defectors is in the works for the call

531
00:35:04,180 --> 00:35:07,879
but trying to become a citizen does run
trying actual letters

532
00:35:07,880 --> 00:35:10,970
action passwords unical symbols

533
00:35:10,970 --> 00:35:14,160
like act characters a keeper

534
00:35:14,160 --> 00:35:18,020
so I how long do you think things like
forty year said

535
00:35:18,020 --> 00:35:21,759
and Q-eight yes basically

536
00:35:21,760 --> 00:35:25,490
your skin wonder there's a lot of

537
00:35:25,490 --> 00:35:29,270
I was like for

538
00:35:29,270 --> 00:35:33,890
that Cesar reached and that has enjoyed

539
00:35:33,890 --> 00:35:37,690
I just talk more over perspective

540
00:35:37,690 --> 00:35:41,450
when is the first step defense

541
00:35:41,450 --> 00:35:45,750
for def

542
00:35:45,750 --> 00:35:48,770
but the early ones tend to be the good
ones

543
00:35:48,770 --> 00:35:51,770
so the eventful be more like experts

544
00:35:51,770 --> 00:35:56,660
I was good expansion percent plus as
possible

545
00:35:56,660 --> 00:36:01,210
and any questions probably early

546
00:36:01,210 --> 00:36:05,050
I'm feel free to email me your come my
blogger

547
00:36:05,050 --> 00:36:12,050
Twitter questions

548
00:36:12,279 --> 00:36:19,279
and ok

549
00:36:26,730 --> 00:36:31,140
such a question about for online
cracking up

550
00:36:31,140 --> 00:36:34,680
offline a I would

551
00:36:34,680 --> 00:36:37,890
to Moore's sites to adopt things like

552
00:36:37,890 --> 00:36:42,160
detecting multiple times the same IP
address

553
00:36:42,160 --> 00:36:45,879
noble to battles Sun

554
00:36:45,880 --> 00:36:49,530
because it is a difference between brute
forcing first crack

555
00:36:49,530 --> 00:36:52,760
so I've ever since both but this is more
a crack

556
00:36:52,760 --> 00:36:56,050
with with force I i'm

557
00:36:56,050 --> 00:37:01,110
the best thing is to take the more xoxox
something to talk after Sunday's game

558
00:37:01,110 --> 00:37:01,640
sites

559
00:37:01,640 --> 00:37:05,460
combine them and see which ones the most
common and then

560
00:37:05,460 --> 00:37:09,680
trying one password for every user
rather than every password for each user

561
00:37:09,680 --> 00:37:12,980
find that very good locked I'm

562
00:37:12,980 --> 00:37:16,810
if you are having a site I would
recommend occupy dressed up by User

563
00:37:16,810 --> 00:37:19,910
but I don't senator lecture

564
00:37:19,910 --> 00:37:23,350
story to tell that last week just the
border I'm

565
00:37:23,350 --> 00:37:26,730
wrote that a tweet saying if you receive
your password

566
00:37:26,730 --> 00:37:31,640
experience compass Philip and I was
based on a question at

567
00:37:31,640 --> 00:37:35,020
the sack or some BS if I can make a
service where

568
00:37:35,020 --> 00:37:38,190
you can check if and I said absolutely

569
00:37:38,190 --> 00:37:43,170
seven astronauts reply yes so I

570
00:37:43,170 --> 00:37:46,810
actual that i touch with the results I'm
not sure how it works

571
00:37:46,810 --> 00:37:50,580
real hazard for the best record blacks
knew it was happening and if

572
00:37:50,580 --> 00:37:54,520
tried staff I got a text book

573
00:37:54,520 --> 00:38:01,520
or we have been

574
00:38:06,720 --> 00:38:09,660
I wanted to ask about cranking salty
hospitals

575
00:38:09,660 --> 00:38:13,319
mentioned you put all to do that and it
was just so what but I'm not sure how

576
00:38:13,320 --> 00:38:15,850
you do it well enough to know the song
beforehand

577
00:38:15,850 --> 00:38:19,520
and if you do how do you get it yet so
typically

578
00:38:19,520 --> 00:38:23,590
when you were when you have a password
application you store called

579
00:38:23,590 --> 00:38:27,890
in the division along with a password up
the salt is going to be a secret

580
00:38:27,890 --> 00:38:31,220
so with credit cards gonna see the
numbers

581
00:38:31,220 --> 00:38:35,780
or whether where the corner where what
thanks for the card number

582
00:38:35,780 --> 00:38:39,050
they don't trust the b---- whistles not
like that South

583
00:38:39,050 --> 00:38:42,320
you to the source file with the password
so

584
00:38:42,320 --> 00:38:45,510
when people cut my list of passwords
deeply perhaps

585
00:38:45,510 --> 00:38:51,120
they typically also myself the the
resulting more secure those

586
00:38:51,120 --> 00:38:55,140
you can't confirm country with people's
CK thank you very much 25

587
00:38:55,140 --> 00:38:58,279
characters just to match because

588
00:38:58,280 --> 00:39:02,800
with salts initial password thinker
makes 24 kar

589
00:39:02,800 --> 00:39:07,190
so effectively addressing with people's
but also prevents people from

590
00:39:07,190 --> 00:39:10,590
from usually and without

591
00:39:10,590 --> 00:39:15,790
over question is that we recognized as a
consultant you have to first on the

592
00:39:15,790 --> 00:39:17,350
scene has 46

593
00:39:17,350 --> 00:39:20,970
which houses the 10 with her and you
compared

594
00:39:20,970 --> 00:39:25,830
hundreds of times 13 password with
salted

595
00:39:25,830 --> 00:39:29,940
you do every five with the first hole
you check medium have difficulty check

596
00:39:29,940 --> 00:39:33,120
the FBI if I for every single password
in the

597
00:39:33,120 --> 00:39:36,600
people not just one flats why we get

598
00:39:36,600 --> 00:39:41,810
actually checks per second with no salt
competitor check

599
00:39:41,810 --> 00:39:46,360
with as quick question

600
00:39:46,360 --> 00:39:49,580
on what's the longest the Spurs

601
00:39:49,580 --> 00:39:53,529
that's very unusual Angeles one like
friends

602
00:39:53,530 --> 00:39:56,580
along with other and never concerned
that

603
00:39:56,580 --> 00:40:01,160
if he was listening to get it passed

604
00:40:01,160 --> 00:40:08,160
I had asked her to work with

605
00:40:08,600 --> 00:40:11,660
ago via they were with have

606
00:40:11,660 --> 00:40:17,129
store be I was here

607
00:40:17,130 --> 00:40:20,440
do for your country to on this one on it

608
00:40:20,440 --> 00:40:23,760
phone and dollar your and

609
00:40:23,760 --> 00:40:27,580
characters yet

610
00:40:27,580 --> 00:40:30,590
i coming up for because

611
00:40:30,590 --> 00:40:33,710
question

612
00:40:33,710 --> 00:40:38,090
GG use graphics cards to crack I haven't

613
00:40:38,090 --> 00:40:41,340
I was over contest with that crime

614
00:40:41,340 --> 00:40:44,760
we are specifically using basically just

615
00:40:44,760 --> 00:40:48,430
that servers with of course and a couple
hours meantime

616
00:40:48,430 --> 00:40:51,440
we got thanks the people got first place

617
00:40:51,440 --> 00:40:54,830
couple of us were actually figure out
and stuff

618
00:40:54,830 --> 00:40:58,690
and they just use the house of cards
just those underwater

619
00:40:58,690 --> 00:41:02,490
crack 100

620
00:41:02,490 --> 00:41:05,980
had for so I person at work

621
00:41:05,980 --> 00:41:09,770
graphics cards because hardware it's a
record

622
00:41:09,770 --> 00:41:13,200
I've heard recently that Amazon ec2 your

623
00:41:13,200 --> 00:41:18,650
direct contact I think that yet just
tryin see a week

624
00:41:18,650 --> 00:41:22,140
with graphics cards I think we actually
use the c2

625
00:41:22,140 --> 00:41:28,009
with other carts for means

626
00:41:28,010 --> 00:41:31,540
me

627
00:41:31,540 --> 00:41:34,930
us you

628
00:41:34,930 --> 00:41:38,710
done he said hmm say

629
00:41:38,710 --> 00:41:43,790
signed clients something cam obscured

630
00:41:43,790 --> 00:41:47,550
would have to use at least one special
character to at least

631
00:41:47,550 --> 00:41:52,240
okay ones at least number someone the
most common

632
00:41:52,240 --> 00:41:56,100
and turns the most common tens

633
00:41:56,100 --> 00:41:59,210
yeah so I wasn't

634
00:41:59,210 --> 00:42:02,590
businesses and all sites don't have
myspace knows

635
00:42:02,590 --> 00:42:05,810
26 that this is a very poor because I've
attack

636
00:42:05,810 --> 00:42:09,370
I look for or region thanks where people
to use

637
00:42:09,370 --> 00:42:14,410
ask policies requires a number this is a
good talk

638
00:42:14,410 --> 00:42:18,750
second where accident good defense

639
00:42:18,750 --> 00:42:22,820
how well work so cures

640
00:42:22,820 --> 00:42:27,210
whether to get this summer was like a
drug addiction every

641
00:42:27,210 --> 00:42:30,750
at hoelter so have a house was contained
a number or

642
00:42:30,750 --> 00:42:35,490
thing on Facebook number glasses and
more tankers for kicker

643
00:42:35,490 --> 00:42:39,490
and see which one week ago stuff so

644
00:42:39,490 --> 00:42:42,810
by people with pictures in the car 20
percent passwords

645
00:42:42,810 --> 00:42:46,279
week ago seventy percent of the past

646
00:42:46,280 --> 00:42:49,490
seven workers which its

647
00:42:49,490 --> 00:42:53,080
pretty much not worse I was lucky

648
00:42:53,080 --> 00:42:56,230
Huskers was after his number was the
fourth

649
00:42:56,230 --> 00:43:00,120
switched over with numbers in them so
the accident

650
00:43:00,120 --> 00:43:03,830
that help that much when you tonight
workers earning simple

651
00:43:03,830 --> 00:43:07,310
we certainly with John 39 Huskers

652
00:43:07,310 --> 00:43:10,680
crack like 20 percent and looking into
some weird

653
00:43:10,680 --> 00:43:15,060
about 6 percent a pretty big jump we
serve in the fall

654
00:43:15,060 --> 00:43:18,670
crosswords or your comes with numbers
and symbols

655
00:43:18,670 --> 00:43:23,140
we certainly got below one percent crack
at these numbers

656
00:43:23,140 --> 00:43:26,220
look good but I much over the severe
because

657
00:43:26,220 --> 00:43:29,640
if you told me we have remastered very
someone

658
00:43:29,640 --> 00:43:35,220
if you don't wanna play couple and the
password is going to happen up

659
00:43:35,220 --> 00:43:38,360
so decided forcibly occurs

660
00:43:38,360 --> 00:43:42,410
so what these niggas tend to be with us
forever

661
00:43:42,410 --> 00:43:47,109
better jefferson's

662
00:43:47,110 --> 00:43:51,190
